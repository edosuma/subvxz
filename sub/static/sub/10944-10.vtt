Lou: I thought that you were
already Georgie's foster parent?

00:03.770 --> 00:07.262
Temporary foster parent,
but I wanna be long-term.

Infection's gone. (Laughs)

04:35.414 --> 04:37.215
You're feeling better, too, aren't ya?

04:37.283 --> 04:38.917
So you think he can go back to his mom?

04:38.985 --> 04:40.485
I think so.

04:40.552 --> 04:41.353
But we should probably
get stumpy's tents up first

04:41.420 --> 04:43.053

04:43.121 --> 04:45.055
Yeah, I guess that's sorta
why we came in the first place.

07:36.451 --> 07:37.651

07:39.186 --> 07:40.819
Lou: The Hanley place...

07:41.755 --> 07:44.390
our place, it burned down, and um...

07:44.458 --> 07:47.660
Georgie almost didn't
make it out of the barn.

07:47.727 --> 07:49.361
Jack rescued me.

07:50.463 --> 07:52.397
Oh my God... (Drops bag)

Lou: Just yesterday,
the contractor told Peter

08:02.241 --> 08:04.943
there's an issue with the wiring, and he...

08:05.010 --> 08:06.710
(Sighs) we were supposed to meet with him,

08:06.778 --> 08:08.179
then Katie got sick so we couldn't,

08:08.246 --> 08:09.646
and we put it off.

08:10.648 --> 08:11.882
What if we hadn't put it off?

08:11.950 --> 08:13.117
We should never have put it off.

08:13.185 --> 08:14.485
Lou, hey...

08:15.753 --> 08:18.789
I just loved that place, Amy.

08:18.856 --> 08:22.758
It was gonna be our
home... and now it's gone.

08:22.826 --> 08:24.327
Hey... come here.

08:25.262 --> 08:26.329
It's okay.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.731

<i>Peter: Georgie? You in here?</i>

08:38.808 --> 08:40.842
Hey... there she is.

08:42.111 --> 08:45.414
I've been looking all over for you.

08:46.382 --> 08:49.918
I'm really sorry that I
couldn't catch Phoenix.

08:49.986 --> 08:52.654
- I am...
- It's not your fault.

08:52.722 --> 08:53.888
I was the one who put him in that stall,

08:53.956 --> 08:55.323
and he could've died.

08:55.390 --> 08:56.791
Well, he didn't.

08:57.727 --> 09:01.262
And you know what? It's nobody's fault.

09:02.197 --> 09:04.232
I probably won't even see him again.

09:04.299 --> 09:05.600
I don't know.

09:05.668 --> 09:07.035
You know, from what I've heard,

09:07.103 --> 09:10.104
that horse has bolted before,

09:10.171 --> 09:12.372
but he always comes back
to the people that love him.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.374
Right. Like that happens.

09:14.442 --> 09:16.143
Hey, hey...

09:16.210 --> 09:18.078
Georgie, listen.

09:20.414 --> 09:23.216
You can't keep running
away whenever you want.

09:23.284 --> 09:27.187
I didn't run away because I wanted to.

09:27.255 --> 09:28.588
Why, then?

09:30.057 --> 09:31.558
Everything's a mess and it's all my fault.

09:31.626 --> 09:33.860
Hey, hey, come here.

09:33.927 --> 09:37.330
No, it's not, so don't you say that.

09:37.398 --> 09:39.098
And you can tell me, you can.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.700
You can tell me anything you want.

09:40.768 --> 09:43.035
I won't get mad. I promise.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.408
Georgie...

09:53.313 --> 09:55.447
<i>Lou: There's something
else you should know.</i>

09:55.515 --> 09:58.050
Um, Georgie was with
Phoenix when she ran away,

09:58.117 --> 09:59.850
and he's okay,

09:59.918 --> 10:02.053
but he was trapped in a stall full of smoke

10:02.120 --> 10:03.521
and Peter said when they got there,

10:03.589 --> 10:06.191
he was just completely panicked, crazed.

10:06.258 --> 10:07.938
And as soon as they got him outta the barn,

10:07.993 --> 10:09.561
he bolted.

10:09.628 --> 10:11.496
But we haven't seen him since.

10:11.564 --> 10:13.764
It's okay. We'll find him.

10:13.832 --> 10:14.798
(Door bangs shut) I'm sorry.

10:14.865 --> 10:15.899
It's okay.

10:16.867 --> 10:17.934
(Half-sobbed) Dad...

10:18.002 --> 10:19.369
Sweetheart.

10:20.305 --> 10:21.438
(Whimpers and sobs)

10:21.506 --> 10:24.874
Oh honey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

10:25.643 --> 10:30.879
<i>Jack: Georgie, what were you
doing hanging out in that barn?</i>

10:30.947 --> 10:32.448
Was it about missing the camping trip?

10:32.516 --> 10:35.117
That we had to meet with Clint instead?

10:35.185 --> 10:37.052
Were you that angry with me?

10:37.120 --> 10:38.721
No.

10:38.788 --> 10:40.523
Georgie, look at me.

10:42.292 --> 10:43.726
I want an answer.

10:47.330 --> 10:50.365
I'm a runaway; It's what I do.

10:52.868 --> 10:55.370
Well, that's not good enough,

10:55.438 --> 10:58.906
and I don't believe it for a second.

11:00.175 --> 11:02.376
Well, it's the truth.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.781
(Crickets chirp, dishes clank)

11:08.950 --> 11:11.318
Amy: Hey, um... I decided to put it away.

11:11.386 --> 11:14.455
I think it's probably best if we wait,

11:14.522 --> 11:15.489
- Ty: Yeah.
- Amy: If that's okay.

11:15.557 --> 11:18.125
No, I think you're right.

11:20.294 --> 11:23.296
Ty, um... I'm really glad you asked me.

11:24.498 --> 11:25.765
The time was right.

11:25.832 --> 11:27.600
It was. It was magical.

11:27.668 --> 11:30.270
I'm never gonna forget it.

11:30.337 --> 11:32.505
Did it take your breath away?

11:32.573 --> 11:34.373
(Laughs) Yeah. I'm still not breathing.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.507
(Laughs)

11:38.110 --> 11:42.648
You know, it kinda feels
wrong to be so happy right now.

11:43.916 --> 11:47.018
(Shrill whinny in the distance)

11:47.086 --> 11:49.120
Did you hear that?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.434
(Screen door creaks shut)

12:07.004 --> 12:09.372
I thought I heard Phoenix,

12:10.374 --> 12:12.241
but I guess not.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.715
<i>(Shrill whinny)</i>

12:28.157 --> 12:29.558
(Gasps) Phoenix!

12:31.695 --> 12:33.295
Amy: (Sleepily) What?

12:34.197 --> 12:37.299
- Georgie: Phoenix!
- Amy: Remi, stay.

12:37.367 --> 12:38.566
Phoenix?!

12:38.634 --> 12:40.067
(Phoenix grunts nervously and whinnies)

12:40.135 --> 12:41.803
Georgie: No, no, no! No,
no, no! Don't go! Don't go!

12:41.870 --> 12:42.870
Oh, please!

12:48.577 --> 12:51.679
He's afraid of me. He hates me!

12:55.599 --> 12:57.901
<i>Amy: He just got spooked. That's it, okay?</i>

12:57.968 --> 12:59.569
Horses can take just as long as humans

12:59.637 --> 13:01.671
to get over a shock.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.741
I'm gonna get him back, all right?

13:05.709 --> 13:07.076
(Spartan grunts)

13:11.814 --> 13:13.849
(Vehicle rumbles nearby)

13:22.625 --> 13:25.927
Clint: Boy, I'm glad you
turned up. Thanks, Jack.

13:25.994 --> 13:27.695
I mean, I know you people
have enough on your minds

13:27.763 --> 13:30.230
without running around,
looking for my belongings.

13:30.298 --> 13:31.933
Oh, I'm sorry to hear about
your property, by the way.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.701
Thanks, Clint.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.739
(Uncomfortable) So...

13:39.675 --> 13:41.474
I guess we should get
down to the issue at hand.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.643
Your face is like a book, Clint,

13:43.711 --> 13:47.513
so just spill it...
what you came to tell me.

13:48.449 --> 13:49.716
It's not good news.

13:49.784 --> 13:51.184
Child services turned
down your application.

13:51.251 --> 13:52.185
(Lou gasps)

13:52.252 --> 13:53.787
I figured.

13:53.854 --> 13:55.021
<i>Lou: Are you kidding me? This is ridicul...</i>

13:55.089 --> 13:57.222
grandpa is the best possible person

13:57.290 --> 13:58.857
to look after Georgie!

13:58.925 --> 14:03.095
I mean, he just saved
her from a burning barn!

14:03.162 --> 14:05.597
So you save her from barns and wells?

14:05.664 --> 14:06.698
Yeah.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.934
So why? What are the details?

14:10.002 --> 14:13.371
Well, Jack,

14:13.439 --> 14:15.974
in the conversations I had with Georgie,

14:16.041 --> 14:17.882
and the conversations I
had with Peter and Lou,

14:17.943 --> 14:20.611
and even with you, I, I just...

14:20.678 --> 14:22.313
I began to have some reasonable doubts

14:22.380 --> 14:23.714
about your ability to cope.

14:23.781 --> 14:26.417
Then there was some issue
about the lack of backup,

14:26.485 --> 14:28.086
not to mention the unreported runaways...

14:28.120 --> 14:29.620
even some safety issues.

14:29.687 --> 14:31.755
The interview I had with
your son-in-law, Tim,

14:31.823 --> 14:33.624
- he said...
- ah, Tim!

14:33.691 --> 14:34.925
<i>You know, I should've known!</i>

14:34.993 --> 14:36.559
It was because he got himself involved.

14:36.627 --> 14:38.194
I never asked him to.

14:38.262 --> 14:41.464
Well, Tim wasn't the
ultimate deciding factor.

14:41.532 --> 14:42.565
Then what was?

14:45.236 --> 14:46.503
Your age, Jack.

14:48.639 --> 14:49.839
(Stunned) My age?

14:57.147 --> 14:58.980
I thought anyone from eighteen to eighty

14:59.048 --> 15:01.250
could apply for foster parent status.

15:01.317 --> 15:05.154
Clint: Yes, if it's in the
best interests of the child.

15:05.221 --> 15:06.788
But in this case,

15:07.723 --> 15:09.724
my colleagues believe that your age

15:09.792 --> 15:13.227
is not in the best interests of the child.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.501
Lou: This is so not fair.

15:20.569 --> 15:22.403
You know, Clint was here
on the worst possible day!

15:22.471 --> 15:24.638
I was crazed. Katie had a temperature.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.339
She was throwing up everywhere!

15:26.407 --> 15:28.327
I know. I'm sure that
wasn't the deciding factor.

15:28.376 --> 15:30.077
Lou: I know, but... whatever.

15:30.145 --> 15:32.146
I made it seem like I
couldn't be counted on;

15:32.213 --> 15:33.313
like grandpa didn't have backup,

15:33.381 --> 15:34.915
and it makes me crazy!

15:34.983 --> 15:37.517
<i>You should've seen the
look on grandpa's face.</i>

15:37.585 --> 15:40.553
I mean, I've never seen him so devastated.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.655
This is a nightmare and I wanna wake up.

15:42.723 --> 15:44.523
Listen, just stop, okay?

15:44.591 --> 15:47.860
Let's not stress out about
everything all at once.

15:49.196 --> 15:51.630
What exactly did Clint say
is gonna happen to Georgie?

15:51.699 --> 15:53.632
They're gonna start looking
for a new placement for her,

15:53.701 --> 15:55.001
you know, and...

15:55.069 --> 15:56.868
and Georgie's gonna be devastated too.

15:56.936 --> 15:59.037
She loves it here, and she loves grandpa.

15:59.105 --> 16:00.471
It's not fair.

16:00.539 --> 16:01.606
(Cell phone rings) I...

16:01.674 --> 16:03.441
it's the fire Marshall.

16:03.509 --> 16:06.211
<i>(Phone beeps) Hello, Peter Morris speaking.</i>

16:07.146 --> 16:08.814
(Vehicle door bangs shut)

16:09.749 --> 16:13.184
Jack: You! Just the guy I wanna talk to!

16:14.152 --> 16:16.353
What'd you say to Clint?

16:16.421 --> 16:17.554
About what?

16:17.622 --> 16:19.123
You know damn well about what!

16:19.191 --> 16:21.258
My relationship with Georgie.

16:21.326 --> 16:23.728
What did I say? I said great things.

16:23.795 --> 16:25.295
I told him about the steers

16:25.363 --> 16:27.031
and how you taught her to herd them.

16:27.099 --> 16:28.531
Well, now his bosses think

16:28.599 --> 16:30.934
I couldn't care less about child safety.

16:31.001 --> 16:33.737
Did you tell Clint I was teaching
her to drive the tractor?!

16:33.804 --> 16:36.339
Yeah! Yeah! That's a great accomplishment.

16:36.406 --> 16:37.640
Jack: She's eleven, Tim!

16:37.708 --> 16:39.475
She's not supposed to be driving a tractor!

16:39.543 --> 16:41.144
But she did it!

16:41.212 --> 16:42.545
Jack: Well, you don't
have to tell that to Clint!

16:42.613 --> 16:44.579
Gah! You don't get it do ya?

16:45.514 --> 16:47.682
What is... what is this about?

16:48.651 --> 16:51.653
I got turned down. That's what it's about.

16:51.721 --> 16:53.055
And you think it's because of me?

16:53.123 --> 16:55.690
It's my fault? Is that what you're saying?

16:55.759 --> 16:57.459
<i>'Cause if you think it's because of me,</i>

16:57.526 --> 16:58.660
<i>I can fix it.</i>

16:58.728 --> 16:59.994
Just stay out of it.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.462
No! I'm not gonna stay out of it.

17:01.529 --> 17:03.097
I'll talk to Clint, I'll make it right.

17:03.165 --> 17:04.932
<i>Jack: Don't!</i>

17:05.000 --> 17:07.234
Besides, there's another reason.

17:07.301 --> 17:08.702
What?

17:08.771 --> 17:10.104
My age.

17:19.046 --> 17:20.280
(Tack jingles lightly)

17:33.726 --> 17:34.760
(Sighs)

17:36.062 --> 17:37.396
(Snorts softly)

17:41.935 --> 17:43.135
(Tack jingles)

17:49.574 --> 17:50.074
(Grunting)

17:50.742 --> 17:51.442
(Galloping)

18:08.759 --> 18:09.993
You're okay.

18:10.962 --> 18:12.462
Good boy, Phoenix.

18:13.998 --> 18:15.032
Whoa...

18:15.800 --> 18:16.834
Whoa.

18:18.502 --> 18:20.803
(Softly) Good boy... good boy...

18:22.039 --> 18:23.139
that's a good boy.

18:24.074 --> 18:25.274
Let's go home.

18:26.877 --> 18:28.911
(Congested breath)

18:31.348 --> 18:33.515
Are you okay? Hmm?

18:34.451 --> 18:36.084
(Congested breaths)

18:39.055 --> 18:40.155
(Dialling beeps)

18:42.691 --> 18:45.293
Hey, Ty, um, can you come meet me?

18:46.229 --> 18:48.063
There's something wrong with Phoenix.

18:53.101 --> 18:54.801
Jack: Amy's not back?

18:54.870 --> 18:56.470
Georgie: Not yet.

18:56.537 --> 18:58.873
Well, she'll find him.

18:58.940 --> 19:00.374
And even if she doesn't,

19:00.441 --> 19:03.810
if he showed up once, he'll show up again.

19:05.413 --> 19:07.581
Georgie: What did Clint want?

19:08.548 --> 19:10.984
Jack: Okay. Well...

19:13.954 --> 19:16.622
I didn't wanna tell you ahead of time,

19:16.690 --> 19:21.160
but I applied to be your
long-term foster parent.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.930
- I knew that.
- You knew? How did you know?

19:25.865 --> 19:27.165
Did he say yes?

19:29.769 --> 19:34.139
Well, it wasn't up to
Clint. Well, not entirely.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.542
So, unfortunately, no.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.044
<i>I was turned down.</i>

19:41.013 --> 19:42.380
It's because of me.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.181
Well, why do you say that?

19:45.117 --> 19:48.119
I told him about the well, Jack, and...

19:49.054 --> 19:52.023
<i>I made you look... kinda bad.</i>

19:52.090 --> 19:54.926
<i>And it came out all wrong
and I'm just really sorry.</i>

19:54.993 --> 19:57.160
(Crying) I wrecked everything.

19:57.228 --> 19:59.862
<i>Jack: You didn't wrecknynything.</i>

20:00.864 --> 20:02.498
It was me.

20:02.566 --> 20:05.435
It was my... my age.
They think I'm too old.

20:08.739 --> 20:12.574
<i>What all this means is... is um...</i>

20:14.210 --> 20:16.545
well, we both know the rules,

20:16.612 --> 20:21.550
and Clint's gonna be looking
for another situation for you.

20:23.954 --> 20:26.588
I told you yesterday that...

20:26.656 --> 20:29.257
I ran away because I wanted to,

20:29.325 --> 20:30.858
and that was a lie.

20:32.294 --> 20:34.262
I don't wanna go anywhere else.

20:34.330 --> 20:35.830
I really don't, Jack.

20:37.366 --> 20:38.433
(Sniffling)

20:41.670 --> 20:42.703
Okay.

20:52.447 --> 20:54.281
(Truck rumbles loudly)

20:58.987 --> 21:01.187
Clint: Look, I'm gonna
have to call you back, okay?

21:01.254 --> 21:02.688
All right. Talk soon.

21:02.755 --> 21:04.223
(Door bang shuts)

21:10.364 --> 21:11.397
Tim?

21:14.667 --> 21:17.568
If I said something that may
have put Jack in a bad light,

21:17.636 --> 21:19.070
it was unintentional.

21:19.138 --> 21:20.271
You've gotta reconsider.

21:20.339 --> 21:21.873
Tim, it wasn't just what you said.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.074
It's his age,

21:23.142 --> 21:23.875
and it's not entirely up to me.

21:23.942 --> 21:25.377
Oh, c'mon.

21:25.444 --> 21:27.278
You know Jack's the best
person for Georgie to be with,

21:27.346 --> 21:29.347
and the whole family is
weighing in to help out,

21:29.415 --> 21:30.882
so his age shouldn't matter.

21:30.949 --> 21:32.216
Look, Tim, I'm on your side.

21:32.283 --> 21:33.950
Well, then act like it.

21:34.019 --> 21:35.685
But it's been processed.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.254
- Processed...
- Yes, processed.

21:37.322 --> 21:38.788
It's very difficult to
get things turned around

21:38.856 --> 21:40.290
once they've been processed.

21:40.358 --> 21:41.825
You know, once they're in the system.

21:41.893 --> 21:43.127
The system...

21:43.194 --> 21:44.528
That's right, the system.

21:44.595 --> 21:45.762
Clint...

21:46.731 --> 21:49.432
You are the system... you!

21:49.500 --> 21:53.102
Look at your track record. You wield power.

21:53.170 --> 21:54.803
You have clout!

21:54.871 --> 21:56.839
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

21:56.907 --> 21:59.442
I would go that far! I would.

21:59.510 --> 22:00.676
Give yourself some credit!

22:00.744 --> 22:03.279
A man in your position, snap your fingers,

22:03.347 --> 22:06.015
you could have Jack's file
back on your desk in no time.

22:06.816 --> 22:08.684
You know, I suppose I
could put in a request

22:08.752 --> 22:09.685
for your appeal.

22:09.753 --> 22:10.886
There you go.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.187
But then, you know,

22:12.255 --> 22:13.522
since you're instigating the process,

22:13.590 --> 22:14.489
there'd be a lot of
paperwork for you to sign.

22:14.558 --> 22:17.392
Fine. Paperwork. Throw it at me.

22:17.460 --> 22:18.894
Okay. (Phone chirps) Shoot!

22:18.962 --> 22:20.262
I got another call.

22:20.329 --> 22:21.896
Of course you do, you're busy.

22:21.964 --> 22:24.732
I'll be in touch. (Phone beeps)

22:24.800 --> 22:25.800
Lisa: Hello?!

22:27.469 --> 22:28.570
(Door closes)

22:32.641 --> 22:34.508
I. Well, hello.

22:36.111 --> 22:38.579
I heard about the fire... and Georgie.

22:38.646 --> 22:40.581
I'm so sorry.

22:40.648 --> 22:42.115
How's everybody doing?

22:42.183 --> 22:44.952
Oh, we're all in kind of
a state of shock, I guess.

22:45.019 --> 22:46.453
Lisa: I bet.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.088
Any idea what caused it?

22:48.155 --> 22:49.522
No.

22:49.591 --> 22:51.191
No, Peter's looking on that,

22:51.258 --> 22:53.292
and Lou, not so much.

22:54.494 --> 22:56.062
Jack...

22:56.129 --> 22:57.897
I'm glad you're here though.

22:57.965 --> 22:59.599
<i>Lisa: Let me get something
straight with you.</i>

22:59.666 --> 23:01.366
That whole Dan thing...

23:02.335 --> 23:03.435
was a misunderstanding.

23:03.503 --> 23:05.170
There's no reconciliation.

23:05.238 --> 23:07.873
There was never a reconciliation.

23:07.941 --> 23:10.142
<i>Jack: What about our reconciliation?</i>

23:10.210 --> 23:12.478
Is there any chance of that?

23:12.545 --> 23:14.012
I don't know.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.048
Well, I'd kinda like to figure things out

23:17.117 --> 23:19.485
so then... then we would know.

23:20.453 --> 23:22.588
I guess we would.

23:22.655 --> 23:24.523
I do know that I'm here to stay and help,

23:24.591 --> 23:26.724
and do whatever I can.

23:26.791 --> 23:28.559
Well, that's a start.

23:30.295 --> 23:31.929
Do hear anything?

23:32.897 --> 23:35.166
Yeah. You were right.

23:36.268 --> 23:38.002
Smoke inhalation problems.

23:38.069 --> 23:39.370
It could be worse.

23:39.438 --> 23:41.304
He's not coughing, so that's a good sign.

23:41.372 --> 23:44.174
Okay. So what do we do?

23:44.242 --> 23:45.242
Ty: Well, we gotta make
sure he has plenty of water

23:45.309 --> 23:46.943
to keep his airways moist.

23:47.011 --> 23:48.478
That'll help clear his lungs
of any inhaled particulate

23:48.546 --> 23:50.680
from the smoke.

23:50.748 --> 23:52.449
Inhaled particulate.

23:52.517 --> 23:55.185
Wow! You're sounding quite
knowledgeable, Dr. Borden.

23:55.253 --> 23:56.686
It's kinda sexy.

23:56.754 --> 23:59.054
Well, there's nothing sexier
than inhaled particulate.

23:59.122 --> 24:00.722
(Laughing)

24:00.790 --> 24:02.024
We gotta water down his hay.

24:02.091 --> 24:03.392
That'll help reduce any
particles in the dust,

24:03.460 --> 24:06.161
like mold, bacteria, pollen... anything.

24:06.228 --> 24:08.263
- I kinda wanna kiss you right now.
- Yeah?

24:09.431 --> 24:10.932
(Gasps) You found him!

24:11.868 --> 24:13.234
Ty: Hey, Georgie, did
you wanna wet down his hay

24:13.302 --> 24:14.302
and help us feed him?

24:14.370 --> 24:15.771
Why do we have to do that?

24:15.838 --> 24:17.305
Amy: It'll just make his lungs feel better.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.207
He inhaled some smoke, as well, so...

24:19.275 --> 24:21.108
he's gonna be fine, but
this'll help him out.

24:21.176 --> 24:22.342
<i>Amy: Why don't you come and feed him?</i>

24:22.410 --> 24:24.145
It might break the ice between you guys

24:24.212 --> 24:25.245
and help you bond again.

24:30.418 --> 24:31.819
Hey, Phoenix. Hi.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.888
(Phoenix snorts nervously,
kicks the stall hard)

24:33.955 --> 24:35.489
He... he still hates me.

24:36.423 --> 24:38.024
Amy: He doesn't hate you, Georgie,

24:38.092 --> 24:39.693
but it is gonna take some time.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.094
Well, I don't have time.

24:41.162 --> 24:41.843
Of course you do.

24:41.862 --> 24:43.629
No, I don't!

24:43.698 --> 24:46.332
I'm not gonna be around here anymore.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.967
What're you talking about?

24:48.903 --> 24:52.005
Jack got turned down, so... I can't stay.

24:53.006 --> 24:55.374
<i>They're making me leave.</i>

24:59.337 --> 25:01.571
<i>Lou: Lisa, you really
don't have to do all this.</i>

25:01.638 --> 25:04.841
Lisa: Yes, I do. I am gonna cook and clean,

25:04.909 --> 25:06.910
take care of my gorgeous God daughter,

25:06.978 --> 25:08.144
so that you two have more time

25:08.212 --> 25:10.513
to deal with what's on your plate.

25:10.581 --> 25:12.348
Well, Peter's with
those insurance guys now,

25:12.415 --> 25:13.682
dealing with that, so...

25:13.750 --> 25:15.017
Good.

25:15.919 --> 25:18.820
Lou: Hey, Georgie, are you hungry?

25:21.691 --> 25:24.093
Jack: I'll go check on her.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.861
Something happen?

25:26.796 --> 25:27.863
(Sighs heavily)

25:35.905 --> 25:37.571
It's not fair.

25:38.874 --> 25:41.376
No. No it isn't.

25:43.612 --> 25:45.045
I don't wanna go.

25:48.649 --> 25:50.717
I don't want you to either.

25:52.820 --> 25:53.820
(Sniffling)

26:06.934 --> 26:07.967
(Sniffling)

26:15.349 --> 26:19.117
Peter: Okay. I got some
bad news and some good news.

26:19.185 --> 26:20.518
The bad news is...

26:21.320 --> 26:24.422
yes, it was faulty wiring
that caused the fire.

26:24.490 --> 26:25.857
The good news is...

26:26.558 --> 26:28.626
insurance is gonna cover
the cost of the house

26:28.694 --> 26:30.929
and the repairs to the barn.

26:30.997 --> 26:33.430
Good. That's good.

26:33.498 --> 26:35.699
Just good? No, honey,

26:35.767 --> 26:38.402
we can actually recoup the
entire cost of the house.

26:38.469 --> 26:41.038
We can rebuild, or sell the property

26:41.106 --> 26:42.306
and maybe get something

26:42.374 --> 26:45.642
we can actually move into, you know?

26:47.445 --> 26:49.145
Okay, look, I'm...

26:49.213 --> 26:50.813
I'm sorry. I know that you're sad.

26:50.881 --> 26:54.183
I know that you're beyond sad.

26:54.251 --> 26:56.886
But a house is just a thing, honey.

26:56.954 --> 26:59.055
You know, it can be replaced.

26:59.123 --> 27:01.757
We should be counting our
blessings no one was hurt.

27:01.825 --> 27:04.826
How can you just be so
matter of fact about this?

27:04.894 --> 27:06.228
I'm not.

27:06.296 --> 27:07.829
That was the house I had
always dreamed of for us.

27:07.897 --> 27:10.598
I loved that place and
it can't just be replaced.

27:10.666 --> 27:11.599
I know.

27:11.667 --> 27:12.867
No, I mean, for you

27:12.936 --> 27:13.936
it was just an albatross around your neck,

27:14.003 --> 27:15.804
and now you're rid of it.

27:15.871 --> 27:18.873
No wonder you're optimistic.

27:18.942 --> 27:21.475
What does that even mean?

27:21.543 --> 27:23.677
You think I'm happy that
the house burned down?

27:23.745 --> 27:25.746
Really? Honestly? Is
that what you're saying?

27:25.814 --> 27:27.415
No! I know that you're not
glad that the house burned down,

27:27.482 --> 27:28.816
but obviously it meant more to me

27:28.883 --> 27:30.017
than it did to you,

27:30.085 --> 27:31.319
and it's like, it's like you're relieved

27:31.386 --> 27:33.421
that our dreams went up in smoke.

27:33.488 --> 27:35.589
That is not true.

27:35.657 --> 27:37.357
I'm sorry.

27:37.425 --> 27:39.192
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.260
Peter: Lou!

27:42.229 --> 27:43.263
<i>(Screen door snaps shut)</i>

27:49.392 --> 27:51.059
Amy: What're you doing?

27:51.993 --> 27:53.760
What does it look like I'm doing?

27:53.828 --> 27:55.095
I'm packing.

27:55.163 --> 27:56.363
Why?

27:57.165 --> 27:58.726
'Cause Clint will send me to a new home,

27:58.766 --> 28:00.901
and it'll probably be sooner than later.

28:00.969 --> 28:03.603
I've been through this before.

28:03.671 --> 28:07.074
Georgie, before you go...

28:07.142 --> 28:09.108
whenever that is...

28:09.176 --> 28:11.144
you need to make things right with Phoenix.

28:11.211 --> 28:13.279
How? He won't even come near me.

28:13.347 --> 28:15.581
We'll take it slow.

28:15.649 --> 28:18.918
But he needs you just
as much as you need him.

28:18.986 --> 28:21.520
<i>Now, regardless of where you end up,</i>

28:21.588 --> 28:23.489
<i>you can always come back here</i>

28:23.557 --> 28:26.224
because Phoenix will always be your horse,

28:26.292 --> 28:27.826
no matter what.

28:27.893 --> 28:28.893
<i>Okay?</i>

28:30.696 --> 28:32.864
(Spartan grunts)

28:50.648 --> 28:51.983
<i>Hey, Phoenix...</i>

28:53.585 --> 28:56.752
(Phoenix whinnies and kicks the stall)

29:09.900 --> 29:11.534
Jack: See? I missed that...

29:11.602 --> 29:13.035
you bringing stuff you figured we needed

29:13.136 --> 29:15.170
even if we didn't.

29:21.011 --> 29:24.079
So Lou told me about the Georgie decision.

29:24.147 --> 29:25.180
Yeah.

29:27.950 --> 29:30.118
Why didn't you tell me about that?

29:30.185 --> 29:31.852
Well, I guess I know how you always felt

29:31.920 --> 29:33.754
about the situation, so...

29:33.822 --> 29:34.822
Well, I'd be lying if I said

29:34.890 --> 29:36.491
I was all for it from the start.

29:36.558 --> 29:38.792
I had doubts about the whole arrangement.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.329
But um... I think it's a shame.

29:41.397 --> 29:43.797
You would've done an amazing job.

29:43.865 --> 29:46.733
You're doing an amazing job.

29:51.639 --> 29:53.006
Georgie: How is she feeling?

29:53.074 --> 29:55.875
She is right back to normal.

29:57.512 --> 30:00.246
Georgie: Hey, Katie, who's
this guy? Who's this guy?

30:00.313 --> 30:02.915
Is he a fat cat? Can you say "fat cat"?

30:04.584 --> 30:05.717
Lou: Hey, you know how you told me

30:05.785 --> 30:07.919
that you've always wanted a little sister?

30:07.986 --> 30:09.987
Well, you got it.

30:10.056 --> 30:13.058
<i>You are a great big sister to Katie.</i>

30:14.026 --> 30:15.726
Can I visit?

30:15.794 --> 30:18.763
I'll be mad if you don't.

30:18.830 --> 30:20.698
I have a brother.

30:20.766 --> 30:22.267
Really?

30:22.334 --> 30:25.869
Georgie: Yeah. He's older
than me. He's eighteen.

30:25.937 --> 30:26.903
What is your brother's name?

30:26.971 --> 30:29.306
Jeff.

30:30.275 --> 30:31.841
Well, where is he?

30:31.909 --> 30:34.044
Georgie: He's in Fort McMurray.

30:34.112 --> 30:35.745
Um, I phoned him last night

30:35.813 --> 30:38.315
and told him what happened
with Clint and Jack.

30:38.383 --> 30:40.716
And what did he say?

30:40.784 --> 30:41.817
Nothing.

30:46.223 --> 30:48.124
Lou: Are you gonna see your brother?

30:48.192 --> 30:51.194
Georgie: Um... I don't think so.

30:51.261 --> 30:52.895
He doesn't want me.

31:12.280 --> 31:15.682
Lou: I'm sorry for those things I said.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.618
Don't worry about it, honey.

31:17.685 --> 31:19.220
Lou: No.

31:19.287 --> 31:21.388
You know, you poured your
heart and soul into that house,

31:21.456 --> 31:24.057
and I know you did it for me.

31:24.126 --> 31:26.627
And you're right, it's just a house.

31:26.694 --> 31:28.328
I have to let it go.

31:29.263 --> 31:30.730
It's not like we lost a loved one.

31:30.797 --> 31:31.864
(Chuckles)

31:33.667 --> 31:35.635
But we're about to.

31:35.702 --> 31:37.737
What're you talking about?

31:37.804 --> 31:39.239
(Whispers) Georgie.

31:39.306 --> 31:40.773
What is gonna happen to that girl, honey?

31:40.841 --> 31:43.509
I cannot stand the idea of
her with some other family.

31:43.576 --> 31:45.577
I know, honey, I...

31:45.645 --> 31:47.846
Lou: She has a brother. He's eighteen.

31:47.913 --> 31:50.282
He hasn't made any move
to take care of her.

31:50.350 --> 31:51.583
But how could he?

31:51.651 --> 31:54.453
I mean, he's just a kid himself, you know?

31:54.521 --> 31:56.087
It's so hard to grasp

31:56.156 --> 31:59.223
what those two have been through.

31:59.291 --> 32:02.527
We are so lucky we have
a beautiful baby girl.

32:02.594 --> 32:04.562
- We are.
- I know.

32:11.670 --> 32:14.972
We could have another baby, you know.

32:15.906 --> 32:20.277
I think it's time for a
new member of our family,

32:20.344 --> 32:23.346
but I don't think it's a baby.

32:29.270 --> 32:33.005
<i>Yes, I'm... we're very
serious about this, Clint.</i>

32:34.874 --> 32:37.543
Look, I know we came across
badly in the interview...

32:37.610 --> 32:39.611
very badly, in fact...

32:39.679 --> 32:40.979
but it was just one of those days

32:41.048 --> 32:42.381
that went from bad to worse,

32:42.449 --> 32:45.151
and I don't want you to
judge Peter and I by...

32:46.086 --> 32:48.020
well, thank you. I appreciate that.

32:49.655 --> 32:50.821
Sorry?

32:50.889 --> 32:52.257
Yes. Okay, I will hold

32:52.324 --> 32:54.625
because I really need
to talk to you, Clint.

32:54.693 --> 32:56.861
Tim: Yeah, Clint, I got the paperwork.

32:56.929 --> 33:00.565
Yeah. So you really think it's
gonna make a difference, huh?

33:00.632 --> 33:02.300
Well, no, good, yeah.

33:02.368 --> 33:03.901
Uh, just it's a little hard to comprehend,

33:03.969 --> 33:06.103
so I have a few questions.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.106
What, now you have somebody on the line?

33:09.174 --> 33:10.040
Yeah, well, no. Call me back.

33:10.108 --> 33:11.775
Call me back. Sure.

33:13.611 --> 33:15.145
Ty: Hey, Tim, what's up?

33:15.213 --> 33:16.380
Nothing good.

33:16.448 --> 33:17.414
<i>Ty: Oh.</i>

33:17.482 --> 33:19.116
Tim: Nothing good at all.

33:19.184 --> 33:20.383
I'm trying to get Clint to reconsider

33:20.451 --> 33:22.017
this whole Jack thing,

33:22.086 --> 33:23.586
<i>and what does he do? He
sends me a wad of paperwork.</i>

33:23.653 --> 33:26.456
<i>Now, I know I'm gonna screw this up.</i>

33:26.523 --> 33:29.758
You know what I hate?
I hate feeling useless.

33:29.826 --> 33:31.194
This family's falling apart.

33:31.261 --> 33:33.463
I've seen it happen
before... I know the signs...

33:33.530 --> 33:34.663
<i>I see them happening again.</i>

33:34.731 --> 33:36.164
<i>And Lou and Peter,</i>

33:36.232 --> 33:37.466
<i>they're going through a very rough time.</i>

33:37.533 --> 33:38.833
I'll be very surprised if
they even get through it.

33:38.901 --> 33:41.336
So nothing good is happening right now.

33:41.404 --> 33:43.705
Tim, something good is happening.

33:43.772 --> 33:44.706
Really good, actually.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.475
What?

33:46.542 --> 33:48.310
I don't know if I should be
telling you this right now...

33:48.377 --> 33:49.911
Oh, spit it out. What?

33:50.879 --> 33:53.247
I asked Amy to marry me.

33:54.216 --> 33:55.616
She said yes.

33:55.683 --> 33:57.818
She said yes, and that's good news?

33:57.885 --> 33:59.753
Yeah. That's great news!

33:59.821 --> 34:01.622
Let me guess. I'm the last to know.

34:01.689 --> 34:03.890
No, Tim, you're the first to know.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.826
I'm the first to know.

34:07.395 --> 34:09.161
'Cause that... that is good news!

34:09.230 --> 34:11.697
It is good news! Congratulations on that!

34:11.764 --> 34:13.166
- Thank you. That's great!
- That's great news!

34:13.234 --> 34:15.435
But could you keep it under your hat?

34:15.503 --> 34:17.137
Amy and I felt that with
everything that's going on,

34:17.204 --> 34:19.938
it'd be best to wait to tell the others.

34:20.007 --> 34:22.175
- Okay. Thank you.
- That's good.

34:23.244 --> 34:25.511
You're a wise man. Who knew?

34:27.347 --> 34:29.447
(Truck rumbles to a stop)

34:37.056 --> 34:39.158
You're going so soon?

34:39.225 --> 34:41.259
I have to get home and pack.

34:41.326 --> 34:42.793
France? Already?

34:43.695 --> 34:45.496
Yeah. I take possession of the new house.

34:48.333 --> 34:50.301
<i>I know you didn't have
a great time there...</i>

34:50.369 --> 34:52.370
I'm sorry about that...

34:53.304 --> 34:58.141
but it sure would be nice
to see your face at my door,

34:58.209 --> 35:00.143
<i>anytime,</i>

35:01.078 --> 35:04.347
if you can find your way there.

35:04.415 --> 35:07.651
I'll try. I really will.

35:08.619 --> 35:09.653
Okay.

35:12.222 --> 35:13.455
Goodbye.

35:13.523 --> 35:15.691
No. Not goodbye.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.796
Just... 'til next time.

35:22.265 --> 35:26.435
Right. Okay. 'Til next time.

35:28.571 --> 35:31.306
(Car door bangs shut, engine starts)

35:37.045 --> 35:38.479
(Vehicle rumbles away)

35:46.521 --> 35:48.922
Yeah, well, just give me another day.

35:48.989 --> 35:52.058
I'll have all this paperwork to you.

35:52.559 --> 35:55.929
Yeah. Well, twenty-four
hours, Clint. That...

35:57.631 --> 35:58.698
why?

36:00.300 --> 36:04.437
Well, how is that in the
best interest of the kid?

36:06.240 --> 36:07.306
Yeah.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.542
Okay. Fine. You know...

36:11.845 --> 36:14.246
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

36:16.783 --> 36:18.050
(Phone beeps off)

36:18.118 --> 36:19.251
Jack: Why are you talking to Clint?

36:19.318 --> 36:20.485
Lou: Grandpa?

36:21.287 --> 36:23.988
I just saw Lisa leaving. Are you okay?

36:24.056 --> 36:25.990
Jack: Tell me what you said to Clint!

36:26.058 --> 36:28.993
Lou: Clint? You're talking to Clint?

36:29.061 --> 36:31.495
Why are you talking to Clint?

36:33.398 --> 36:35.666
They found a placement for Georgie.

36:40.271 --> 36:41.772
No, Clint, I'm serious about this.

36:41.839 --> 36:44.107
I just need one more day.

36:44.175 --> 36:45.242
Please!

36:47.011 --> 36:48.544
(Sighs) Okay. Bye.

36:49.513 --> 36:50.947
(Phone beeps off)

36:54.051 --> 36:55.351
I don't wanna do this.

36:55.419 --> 36:57.019
But you need to do this.

36:57.087 --> 36:58.620
It doesn't matter.

36:58.688 --> 37:00.322
Yes. It does.

37:07.998 --> 37:09.265
(Rope whips around)

37:15.604 --> 37:17.538
I don't know what I'm doing!

37:17.606 --> 37:20.842
Amy: It's okay. Just keep him moving.

37:20.910 --> 37:22.343
That's good. You're doing great!

37:22.411 --> 37:25.213
He won't do it! He won't change direction!

37:25.281 --> 37:26.547
Yes he will.

37:26.615 --> 37:28.176
He just needs to know you're the leader.

37:30.451 --> 37:32.452
You have to go this way!

37:33.788 --> 37:36.589
This way! You have to go this way!

37:36.657 --> 37:38.658
Do what I tell you!

37:38.726 --> 37:41.461
Oh my God, you stupid horse!

37:41.529 --> 37:45.631
<i>The other way! You have
to go the other way!</i>

37:48.135 --> 37:50.769
She's pretty upset. You
should give her a break.

37:50.838 --> 37:53.605
<i>Georgie: Do what I tell you!</i>

37:54.942 --> 37:57.176
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry!

37:59.012 --> 38:01.279
Don't run away from me!

38:01.347 --> 38:03.681
Please! Don't run away from me!

38:03.749 --> 38:05.783
<i>Please! I'm sorry!</i>

38:06.953 --> 38:08.486
(Sobbing) I'm sorr...

38:09.521 --> 38:11.890
(Phoenix continues galloping)

38:19.231 --> 38:20.264
(Weeping quietly)

38:23.969 --> 38:24.935
(Panting)

38:25.003 --> 38:27.037
(Slows to a halt)

38:42.819 --> 38:45.321
(Phoenix blows out his breath)

38:49.458 --> 38:51.126
(Weeping)

38:53.096 --> 38:55.130
(Hooves thud softly

39:03.606 --> 39:06.173
(Phoenix blows out his breath)

39:08.676 --> 39:09.843
(Crying, happy)

39:41.707 --> 39:43.708
(Door opens)

39:47.080 --> 39:48.780
I know, I saw.

39:50.116 --> 39:53.217
I felt like I was watching Amy.

39:55.754 --> 39:57.956
Peter, I don't think I can bear this.

39:58.023 --> 39:59.223
(Crying) They found her a new home,

39:59.291 --> 40:01.292
and it's all gonna happen tomorrow,

40:01.360 --> 40:03.027
and it's just happening so fast.

40:03.095 --> 40:05.830
I know. I know. Jack told me.

40:05.897 --> 40:07.698
But, honey, we gotta...

40:07.766 --> 40:09.833
we gotta really think
this through, you know.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.901
You kinda blindsided
me with that last idea,

40:11.970 --> 40:14.071
you know and...

40:14.138 --> 40:16.673
but it's not a bad idea.

40:18.509 --> 40:22.245
You know how you talked
about calling Clint?

40:22.313 --> 40:24.347
I think we should do it.

40:26.483 --> 40:27.683
I already have.

40:29.086 --> 40:30.152
(Laughs)

40:36.306 --> 40:38.139
<i>Hey, Georgie,</i>

40:38.207 --> 40:41.176
that was really amazing out there.

40:41.243 --> 40:45.113
Thanks. I'm just glad he likes me again.

40:46.581 --> 40:49.149
Hey? Don't you forget you like me.

40:49.217 --> 40:50.518
He won't.

40:52.187 --> 40:56.290
Um... Georgie, we wanted
to ask you something.

40:58.993 --> 41:00.661
Peter and I have been doing some talking

41:00.729 --> 41:01.994
and we had something

41:02.062 --> 41:04.798
we wanted to discuss with you.

41:04.865 --> 41:07.667
You see, we don't want you to leave.

41:07.735 --> 41:09.068
And, in fact, we would really love it

41:09.136 --> 41:11.705
if you would consider staying here with us

41:11.772 --> 41:13.440
and with Katie.

41:13.507 --> 41:15.942
<i>Peter: We talked to Clint</i>

41:16.009 --> 41:18.777
about becoming your foster parents.

41:18.845 --> 41:20.546
Now, only if that's okay with you.

41:20.613 --> 41:22.948
It has to be right for you.

41:23.883 --> 41:26.552
<i>Peter: What do you think?</i>

41:53.944 --> 41:55.445
Lou: Okay, everyone,

41:55.513 --> 41:57.633
we managed to convince Clint
that we're not the flakes

41:57.681 --> 41:59.215
he thought we were.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.784
Peter: It took a little convincing, but...

42:01.852 --> 42:03.353
Lou: He has started the process

42:03.420 --> 42:06.589
to have us approved to be
her long-term foster parents,

42:06.656 --> 42:08.858
which means Georgie can stay.

42:08.926 --> 42:11.994
Oh, great! That is terrific news!

42:12.061 --> 42:13.262
<i>And you...</i>

42:14.163 --> 42:17.332
you got me in the bargain too, you know.

42:17.400 --> 42:20.869
You can't get rid of me that easy.

42:21.737 --> 42:25.207
Ty: Hey, Georgie! Huh?
You're part of the family now!

42:25.275 --> 42:26.375
(Laughing)

42:26.442 --> 42:27.909
Tim: Congratulations, honey.

42:27.976 --> 42:29.443
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

42:29.511 --> 42:30.945
Lou: Thanks for the help, dad.

42:31.013 --> 42:34.415
- Help? How did you help?
- Paperwork.

42:34.482 --> 42:36.162

what kind of paperwork?</i>

42:36.184 --> 42:37.484

42:40.622 --> 42:42.290
Ty: (Clears throat)

42:42.357 --> 42:44.824
I think Amy and I have our
own announcement to make.

42:44.892 --> 42:46.559
You can tell them.

42:46.627 --> 42:48.395
<i>Ty: So the other day, Amy and I were out... </i>

42:48.462 --> 42:50.830
Amy: Yeah, we were up
at the fishing camp...

42:50.898 --> 42:53.599
<i>and there was these wild
horses and it was so magical!</i>

42:53.667 --> 42:54.801
<i>There was this foal...</i>

42:54.868 --> 42:56.702
Ty: And I asked Amy...

42:56.770 --> 42:58.305
<i>Amy: Well, there was a
shooting star! It was just so...</i>

42:58.372 --> 43:00.339
Ty: I asked Amy if she wanted
to marry me and she said...

43:00.407 --> 43:01.273
Amy: I said yes!

43:01.341 --> 43:02.841
(Lou shrieks excitedly)

43:06.846 --> 43:08.981
