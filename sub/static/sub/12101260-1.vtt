00:04.439 --> 00:05.875
The world
has beenravaged

00:05.962 --> 00:08.051
by an unpredictable virus.

00:08.138 --> 00:11.446
Life as we know it
came to a halt.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.839
Scientists have been
working around the clock

00:13.926 --> 00:16.407
without any success.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.496
Then the storms began.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.935
Weather around the world
deteriorated.

00:23.023 --> 00:27.244
Hurricanes, flooding,
tornados, fires.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.855
Civilization was falling apart.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.603
But the blizzards
wreaked the most havoc.

00:38.690 --> 00:41.998
Ice storms wiped out
cities and farmland,

00:42.085 --> 00:44.261
and show no signs
of slowing down.

00:44.348 --> 00:47.090
Climatologists
are working tirelessly

00:47.177 --> 00:49.788
to find out what's
causing these ice storms

00:49.875 --> 00:51.529
and how they can stop them.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.374
I'm freezing my ass off!

01:12.420 --> 01:15.162
Hey, you want some, kid?

01:15.249 --> 01:16.946
Keep you nice and toasty.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.600
Not if it's that Irish stuff
you gave me last night.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.036
Bites like a dog.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.907
That's how you can
tell it's good.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.953
All right.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.868
Let's get out of here
and run some tests, okay?

01:38.533 --> 01:40.012
Are you sure these are the...

01:42.276 --> 01:44.495
Same coordinates
as last year, huh?

01:44.582 --> 01:46.584
GPS says...

01:46.671 --> 01:48.804
90 degrees North, 135 West.

01:48.891 --> 01:51.067
Last year there was, uh...

01:51.154 --> 01:54.636
8325 feet above sea level.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.072
It's about the same place.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.857
Yeah, well, it's 4,200 now.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.120
That's quite a change.

02:00.207 --> 02:03.035
Yeah.

02:03.123 --> 02:07.910
I believe in some wiggle room,
but that's a sea change.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.410
It's calving.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.023
A little calving.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.155
Uh, what...

02:36.417 --> 02:38.680
Oh, come on, Joe.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.116
What are we supposed to
do when that starts happening

02:40.203 --> 02:41.683
closer to camp?

02:41.770 --> 02:43.772
You know the drill.
We grab everything.

02:43.859 --> 02:47.079
Grab the snowmobiles,
get to safety, call Evac.

02:48.646 --> 02:51.258
Hey, the samples are showing.
Come take a look.

03:01.659 --> 03:03.226
It says 0 PSU.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.361
0% saltwater.
That can't be right.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.016
Last year, it was 30 PSU
and that was normal.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.844
But this is an enormous change.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.455
Haven't seen
anything quite like it.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.587
Okay. How is that much
freshwater intermixing

03:16.674 --> 03:18.198
with saltwater so quickly?

03:18.285 --> 03:20.548
Freshwater coming
off glaciers

03:20.635 --> 03:23.768
might be saturating
the Arctic Ocean.

03:25.596 --> 03:31.559
I mean, maybe it has something
to do with those hikers that...

03:32.560 --> 03:34.126
What?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.607
Yeah. Remember, they set
all those massive fires

03:36.694 --> 03:39.393
by MacKenzie River.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.133
If all those trees
burned down,

03:41.221 --> 03:44.702
then there were
tributaries that were made.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.443
And it would be more
freshwater running off

03:46.530 --> 03:47.705
into the Arctic Ocean.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.012
That's possible.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.709
It's a possibility.

03:51.796 --> 03:55.583
But the numbers are just
too big, staggeringly big.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.541
Okay.
Here's what we know.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.414
Freshwater is less stable
than saltwater, right?

04:00.501 --> 04:01.937
Yeah.

04:02.024 --> 04:04.853
And along with the influx
in glacier melts,

04:04.940 --> 04:07.203
the freshwater from
the new tributaries

04:07.290 --> 04:10.337
could be sending
an unprecedented amount

04:10.424 --> 04:11.990
of freshwater into the ocean.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.949
Right.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.821
Reggie, a massive polar
vortex could form.

04:16.908 --> 04:20.085
I mean, we could see flooding
of biblical levels,

04:20.172 --> 04:22.131
and in worst case scenarios,
another Ice Age.

04:23.959 --> 04:28.180
Mm, you're talking about
the, uh...

04:30.357 --> 04:31.662
Younger Dryas, huh?

04:31.749 --> 04:34.012
The what?

04:34.099 --> 04:35.971
They don't teach that to
your kids anymore in school?

04:36.058 --> 04:38.756
Okay, old-timer.
Just tell me.

04:38.843 --> 04:41.977
Wow, I'm so nice to you, too.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.283
The Younger Dryas, okay.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.982
13,000 years ago,
for 1,200 years,

04:47.069 --> 04:49.027
there was a mini Ice Age, okay?

04:49.114 --> 04:52.553
The glaciers were saturating
the Atlantic Ocean.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.511
It wasn't man-made, of course,

04:54.598 --> 04:56.644
but this time, I'm afraid
we are the culprits.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.210
What are you saying?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.343
That this is causing
all the ice storms?

05:02.824 --> 05:04.565
I'm saying that we're
entering a new Ice Age.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.539
The glaciers are calving
right next to camp!

05:22.626 --> 05:24.106
We gotta get out of here!

05:28.110 --> 05:30.808
Okay, go!
Go, go, go!

05:30.895 --> 05:32.419
The data's not uploaded yet!

05:34.508 --> 05:35.944
I said get out of here!

05:36.031 --> 05:37.989
I'm not leaving here
without this data!

05:40.122 --> 05:41.906
Oh my God. Reggie...

05:41.993 --> 05:43.343
Get out of here right now!

05:44.779 --> 05:46.433
Shit! Shit!

05:47.521 --> 05:49.914
Damn it, I said move!

05:50.001 --> 05:51.089
Okay, I'm moving!

05:51.176 --> 05:53.265
-Move!
-Okay!

06:05.147 --> 06:06.888
Joe!

06:06.975 --> 06:08.542
Reggie, no!

06:08.629 --> 06:09.760
Joe, I'm gonna save you!

06:09.847 --> 06:11.719
Reggie, no!
Save yourself!

06:11.806 --> 06:13.460
Joe, no!

06:16.593 --> 06:17.942
No!

06:29.040 --> 06:30.433
Chamomile tea
with a squirt of honey

06:30.520 --> 06:32.479
and black coffee for Loren.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.002
I forgot to mention the honey.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.047
You think we'd forget
your tea order?

06:37.179 --> 06:38.789
Got the news feed up?

06:38.876 --> 06:40.704
Mmm, yeah. They're still
just talking about the ice.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.619
Honestly, it's nice
to have the focus shift away

06:42.706 --> 06:44.316
from the virus for a minute.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.796
To be fair, these places
have never seen snow,

06:45.883 --> 06:47.407
let alone full-blown ice storms.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.365
I know.

06:49.452 --> 06:50.801
There's got to be more to it
than just the polar vortex.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.588
You know, thanks
to climate change,

06:54.675 --> 06:56.416
all that rapid glacier melt
could be wreaking havoc

06:56.503 --> 06:59.027
on the ecosystem
and causing this weather.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.943
What?

07:02.030 --> 07:05.816
I took some climate and weather
courses en route to my PhD.

07:05.903 --> 07:09.951
Like diseases, weather patterns
behave can change in an instant.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.562
The storms have covered all
of the southern United States

07:12.649 --> 07:14.825
and Mexico in nearly
a foot of ice.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.045
And Central America
is seeing our fair share

07:17.132 --> 07:18.438
of ice storms as well.

07:20.483 --> 07:23.094
Reggie, come in.
This is Loren. Over.

07:28.709 --> 07:29.710
Yes?

07:29.797 --> 07:30.972
Do you want some coffee?

07:31.059 --> 07:33.583
Not now.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.803
Reggie? Joe?
This is not funny anymore.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.457
Over.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.037
What is this cure waiting on?

07:53.124 --> 07:55.387
It works.
It's safe.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.781
We've run multiple studies.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.828
I was the guinea pig and
it worked perfectly!

08:00.915 --> 08:02.656
What more do we need to do
to get this thing out there?

08:02.743 --> 08:04.614
You know the FDA.

08:04.701 --> 08:05.833
They're a bunch of bureaucrats
who would rather wait until

08:05.920 --> 08:07.399
every little thing is locked

08:07.487 --> 08:08.749
than take this thing
public right away.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.141
There are thousands
dead already.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.666
We need this cure
approved yesterday!

08:14.581 --> 08:16.887
I have half a mind to walk
right into their offices...

08:16.974 --> 08:18.976
I mean, you are going
to the U.S. today.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.717
You could just do that.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.806
Oh, no.
That was today?

08:25.069 --> 08:26.941
I need to call my sister.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.247
Thousands of sea creatures
are now washing ashore

08:29.334 --> 08:31.075
all over the world.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.034
There seems to be no
physical injuries

08:33.121 --> 08:35.297
or any sign of trauma in
any of these animals.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.517
But experts are investigating
each incident.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.084
Scientists believe this
is climate-related only.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.999
We'll keep you updated
as we learn more...

08:42.086 --> 08:44.045
I just received some data
from an old friend

08:44.132 --> 08:45.699
stationed at the North Pole.

08:45.786 --> 08:48.049
Check your inbox.

08:48.136 --> 08:51.487
Jill, I especially need you
to take a look at this.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.750
I think we can use your
weather expertise

08:53.837 --> 08:55.839
to verify the conclusion
my friend is making

08:55.926 --> 08:58.102
and what that means
for protecting our vaccine.

08:58.189 --> 09:01.062
0 PSU?

09:01.149 --> 09:03.238
4,200 meters above sea level?

09:03.325 --> 09:05.457
This is impossible.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.764
I've been trying to contact
my friend to confirm

09:07.851 --> 09:11.028
that this was not a mistake,
but he's not responding.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.769
We talk occasionally,

09:12.856 --> 09:14.858
but I don't usually get
data like this from him.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.512
NOAA should
have a weather simulator

09:16.599 --> 09:18.558
that I used when
I was a student.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.124
We should plug this into that
and find out what it means.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.735
Good, good, good.
Come on.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.693
Okay.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.827
Some scientists are calling this an extinction level event.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.699
We'll have our science panel in the studio when we return.

09:29.786 --> 09:32.441
Jill?
You're the weather expert here.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.877
At least the closest we've got.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.487
Do you mind getting
us up to speed?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.272
Of course. Um...

09:37.359 --> 09:38.882
Just give me a second.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.583
What are we looking at here?

09:48.805 --> 09:51.155
Hey, Sis! Lemme guess,
your flight's delayed too?

09:51.242 --> 09:53.157
I think that's one of the
seven signs of the apocalypse.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.290
-Am I right?
-No. Um, I'm sorry.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.597
I'm actually not gonna be
able to make it home.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.816
Jill, you promised!

09:59.903 --> 10:01.601
You were just barely
able to get one of

10:01.688 --> 10:04.038
the last socially distanced
flights here for the holidays.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.563
Something really big
has come up.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.217
We may actually be on
to something here.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.219
You know, this is a really
important week for Mike.

10:11.306 --> 10:15.179
He just got engaged.
You haven't even met Andrea yet.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.660
Family's more important
now than ever.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.228
Yeah, I know, which is
why I can't leave!

10:20.315 --> 10:23.187
My colleagues and I are so
close to a major breakthrough

10:23.274 --> 10:26.800
in this biggest health crisis
in modern history!

10:26.887 --> 10:28.236
Now we have
these crazy ice storms

10:28.323 --> 10:32.283
that don't seem to
be going anywhere.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.024
And the best way I know how
to take care of my family

10:34.111 --> 10:36.505
is to make sure the cure
is successful.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.115
I understand.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.203
Do you want me to say
anything to Mike

10:39.290 --> 10:42.163
when I pick up him and Andrea?

10:42.250 --> 10:44.339
Just that I love him

10:44.426 --> 10:46.428
and I hope
I can see you guys soon.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.604
I love you.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.084
Stay safe.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.260
Love you.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.792
46... 45.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.228
This is us.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.755
Hold on sir.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.627
Let me help you with that.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.455
Thank you.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.239
Hello, folks.
This is your captain speaking.

11:15.326 --> 11:18.373
There may be another delay
in our departure.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.592
But we're going to see what
we can do to get us up

11:20.680 --> 11:22.464
in the air as
quickly as possible.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.684
So make yourself comfortable

11:24.771 --> 11:25.902
and I will keep
everyone updated

11:25.989 --> 11:27.817
once there is more information.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.690
Just when I thought we couldn't
get delayed any longer.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.083
Think this is a sign
we should just

11:33.170 --> 11:35.085
cancel the whole engagement?

11:38.175 --> 11:40.612
Looks like you're not
getting out that easy.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.528
Okay, folks, we have
clearance for takeoff.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.530
Our flight attendants will
now walk down the aisle

11:45.617 --> 11:47.271
to make sure your seats are
in the upright position

11:47.358 --> 11:49.143
and tray tables are put away.

11:49.230 --> 11:52.059
Please stow away all of your
small electronic devices

11:52.146 --> 11:54.017
and place your phones
on airplane mode.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.628
Once we reach an altitude
of 10,000 feet,

11:56.716 --> 11:59.327
you'll be instructed to turn
them if you wish to do.

11:59.414 --> 12:02.069
I'm gonna get the Wi-Fi, so
do you need to check anything?

12:02.156 --> 12:03.940
Just let me know.

12:04.027 --> 12:06.638
You know you can just download
music onto your phone, right?

12:06.726 --> 12:10.207
You don't have
to stream everything.

12:10.294 --> 12:13.210
But how am I gonna know
what I want to listen to

12:13.297 --> 12:14.995
on any given flight?

12:15.082 --> 12:16.736
Music majors, ugh.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.707
No...

12:31.794 --> 12:33.448
Okay, what have we got?

12:33.535 --> 12:34.884
No, no, no, no, no.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.234
What is it?

12:37.321 --> 12:39.019
It's major seismic activity

12:39.106 --> 12:43.632
at both the North and
South Poles at the same time?

12:43.719 --> 12:45.765
That doesn't make any sense!

12:45.852 --> 12:48.289
There's not even a major
fault line by either Pole.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.595
What could cause
seismic activity of that kind

12:50.682 --> 12:52.728
that registers on
the Richter Scale?

12:52.815 --> 12:54.861
Glaciers.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.645
They're breaking apart.

12:56.732 --> 12:57.820
What does that mean?

12:57.907 --> 12:59.387
It means that Reggie was right.

12:59.474 --> 13:00.823
If the weather is going
to get worse.

13:00.910 --> 13:01.911
We need to start to figure out
an action plan

13:01.998 --> 13:03.304
to protect this cure.

13:03.391 --> 13:05.349
Loren? Come in, Loren.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.489
Reggie!
I can hear you! Over!

13:14.576 --> 13:15.838
My research partner is dead.

13:21.409 --> 13:22.976
What happened?

13:23.063 --> 13:26.718
The glacier completely
fell apart.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.155
Felt like an earthquake
or something.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.634
The station survived somehow.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.506
I tried calling
the local emergency line,

13:31.593 --> 13:33.029
but couldn't get through.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.596
Did you get the data we sent?

13:34.683 --> 13:36.946
We did.
Is it true?

13:37.033 --> 13:38.426
What does it mean?
Are we in trouble?

13:38.513 --> 13:40.210
The fires were just what
was needed to create

13:40.297 --> 13:42.299
a tipping point
that's wreaking havoc

13:42.386 --> 13:44.519
on the ecosystem
and our climate, okay?

13:44.606 --> 13:46.521
The glacier melt was
only a part of it.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.392
But thanks to the fires,
we may see something

13:48.479 --> 13:50.960
on a massive scale, and soon.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.963
That would actually make
the storms make sense.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.531
Saltwater can't freeze and
that consistency

13:56.618 --> 13:58.359
is what prevents
a polar vortex

13:58.446 --> 14:00.796
from causing another Ice Age.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.233
But you replace that with
massive amounts of freshwater...

14:03.320 --> 14:06.236
That would explain
the sea creature die-offs.

14:06.323 --> 14:07.847
They wouldn't be able
to handle

14:07.934 --> 14:09.500
the freshwater influx,
not at that level.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.154
Okay.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.764
Let's just say all
that data is correct.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.679
What happens next?

14:14.766 --> 14:16.856
This.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.207
The storm gets worse.

14:20.294 --> 14:23.340
Covers pretty
much everything in ice.

14:23.427 --> 14:26.517
Temperatures plummet
to record lows worldwide...

14:26.604 --> 14:28.606
and then...

14:28.693 --> 14:30.304
It stops.

14:30.391 --> 14:31.696
Wait.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.485
What is that?

14:37.572 --> 14:39.574
If my prediction is correct,

14:39.661 --> 14:44.405
that is the single worst polar
vortex storm system imaginable.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.363
Temperatures starting
at minus 50 Celsius

14:46.450 --> 14:49.192
and only get colder from there.

14:49.279 --> 14:51.107
An ice storm will
circle the globe,

14:51.194 --> 14:54.676
freezing everything
that isn't insulated in.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.852
Everyone on the
outside will die.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.332
Wait. What is this here?

14:59.855 --> 15:00.943
It's a wall of ice.

15:02.597 --> 15:05.469
The first storm is
basically just a foreshock.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.081
The second...

15:09.909 --> 15:14.217
it's coming after the first,
maybe two hours later.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.785
It looks like it's gonna
be 100 degrees colder

15:16.872 --> 15:18.439
than the first wave.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.745
It's going to destroy everything
in its path:

15:20.832 --> 15:24.488
infrastructure, survivors
from the first wave.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.100
At these temperatures it
won't dissipate like the first.

15:27.187 --> 15:29.015
Look, I know
it doesn't make sense,

15:29.102 --> 15:30.799
but I'll verify every decimal.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.627
It's all accurate.

15:32.714 --> 15:38.067
There's an ice storm heading
your way and it looks bad.

15:38.154 --> 15:41.723
It might already be on
its way over to Greenland.

15:41.810 --> 15:45.640
You guys need to start thinking
about protecting that cure.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.729
If humanity is gonna have
any chance of a future,

15:47.816 --> 15:49.644
then the cure must remain
intact or else any survivors

15:49.731 --> 15:52.342
of this ice storm will just die from the disease, all right?

15:52.429 --> 15:54.388
So protect it.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.956
By my estimate, you'll have
about 24 hours to evacuate.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.568
Did you get this data
over to Washington?

16:00.655 --> 16:02.309
I have to restore power
to my computer

16:02.396 --> 16:04.702
and secure network first.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.530
As of right now,
I'm protected

16:06.617 --> 16:09.359
in the eye of the storm,
so to speak, so...

16:09.446 --> 16:11.535
I'm glad to hear you're still
safe, Reggie.

16:11.622 --> 16:14.712
You just worry about getting
yourself back here safe.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.540
Thanks, Loren,
I'm calling a rescue chopper

16:16.627 --> 16:17.846
and getting out of here ASAP.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.761
Okay. Good luck.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.677
-Over and out.
-Over and out.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.549
What do we do with the cure?

16:25.636 --> 16:26.681
There's a safe zone.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.248
What?

16:28.335 --> 16:31.164
A safe zone, just shy
of the equator.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.820
There's roughly 100 miles
either way of the equator

16:35.907 --> 16:37.822
all the way around that
the polar vortex can't reach

16:37.909 --> 16:39.259
due to the northern
and southern rotation

16:39.346 --> 16:40.347
of the Coriolis Effect.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.913
Rerun the sim.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.524
Account for fluctuations
or margins of error

16:43.611 --> 16:44.525
in the program itself.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.483
I know this program!

16:46.570 --> 16:48.398
It hasn't been wrong before,
it won't be wrong now!

16:48.485 --> 16:50.792
We need to get people
heading that way now.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.229
We can't have the
entire population of the world

16:53.316 --> 16:54.926
migrate to such a small
area during a pandemic.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.058
We have the cure right here!

16:56.145 --> 16:57.799
But it has not been approved.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.496
We don't even know if it
will work on a massive scale.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.194
It works.
We know it works.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.325
We have run every test.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.935
We've done everything right.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.547
We know this will work!

17:06.634 --> 17:10.290
If we don't act now,
humanity will die!

17:10.377 --> 17:12.335
Contact the government,
give them the data

17:12.422 --> 17:14.816
and convince them
to start evacuations.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.948
Escaping is just
half the problem.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.950
If we concentrate
those survivors at the equator

17:19.038 --> 17:20.735
without a cure, it's only
a matter of time

17:20.822 --> 17:23.564
before the virus eradicates
the entire population!

17:23.651 --> 17:27.829
We have just 24 hours, less for
people closest to the Poles.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.746
I'm going home.

17:31.833 --> 17:34.531
What?
No, you can't just give up!

17:34.618 --> 17:36.403
I've not seen my wife in months.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.231
I'm getting on
the first plane back to her

17:38.318 --> 17:40.189
before they cancel them all.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.799
And then she and
I will decide what to do

17:41.886 --> 17:43.323
with the time we have left.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.414
And just what
are we supposed to do?

17:47.501 --> 17:48.763
I don't know.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.809
Play chess? Watch a movie?
Screw?

17:51.896 --> 17:53.289
Whatever you want, really.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.117
I just won't be a part of it.

18:05.127 --> 18:09.523
I wish you the best of luck,
whatever you decide to do.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.786
And for what it's worth,
you guys were the best team

18:11.873 --> 18:14.528
I ever had the pleasure
to work with.

18:18.053 --> 18:21.796
Here, for when things get bad.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.580
They're already bad.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.018
Then for when they get worse.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.282
And they will.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.554
Jill...

18:40.641 --> 18:43.426
The U.S. government is now
leading an effort to mobilize

18:43.513 --> 18:45.385
search and rescue teams
to evacuate people

18:45.472 --> 18:46.386
from the path of the storm.

18:46.473 --> 18:47.996
Okay, good.

18:48.083 --> 18:51.042
At least the government's
on the same page.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.696
Let's get packing.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.177
Emergency Services?

18:55.264 --> 18:56.613
This is EC.
Go ahead.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.962
Yeah. This is Reggie Blanc.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.704
I'm at 90 degrees North,
130 West.

19:01.836 --> 19:05.144
I need Evac now. Over.

19:09.322 --> 19:10.584
ARES?

19:12.325 --> 19:14.153
Anyone?

19:14.240 --> 19:15.328
Over.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.992
Hey, babe?

19:28.079 --> 19:29.516
I think we're landing.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.960
We shouldn't be,
not for another hour.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.670
What's going on?

19:53.757 --> 19:55.281
I think it's just a precaution.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.110
Flight attendants,
please be seated.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.523
Jill?

20:21.916 --> 20:23.004
Jill? Everything okay?

20:24.832 --> 20:26.529
I'm fine.
You can come in.

20:33.057 --> 20:35.582
Is everything okay?

20:35.669 --> 20:37.018
Are you leaving, too?

20:38.846 --> 20:40.151
No.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.459
No family, not even a dog.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.117
I wouldn't worry about him.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.249
He's gonna be all right.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.730
Yeah, well...

20:53.817 --> 20:55.906
Looks like
it's just you and me, pal.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.038
What do we do now?

21:00.084 --> 21:01.825
Ecuador.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.392
-Ecuador?
-Yeah.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.568
Why Ecuador?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.223
It's in the safe zone.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.312
Plus, there's an American
embassy in Quito.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.053
We can meet up with scientists

21:12.140 --> 21:13.359
and start producing the cure
before it's too late.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.274
I like the sound of that.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.276
But we're gonna need a ton of
good karma to make it there.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.800
Even if we're going 75 miles
an hour, it's a 30-hour drive.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.368
Not to mention how shitty
the roads were before the ice.

21:22.455 --> 21:24.152
I know where we can start.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.475
Reggie? Come in, Reggie.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.393
Hey, it's Reggie.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.960
Who's this?

21:50.047 --> 21:51.571
Loren?

21:51.658 --> 21:54.225
Uh, he wanted to spend
time with his wife.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.183
He always had his
priorities, huh?

21:56.706 --> 21:59.013
Yeah. So it's just me
and Oscar now.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.144
I'm Jill.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.103
We are headed with the cure

22:02.190 --> 22:03.844
down to the American
Embassy in Ecuador.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.498
Anything I can do?

22:05.585 --> 22:07.021
Well, if you've got
something strong to drink,

22:07.108 --> 22:08.283
I suggest starting there.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.591
I got my old standby,
Irish Whisky,

22:11.678 --> 22:13.462
the best disinfectant
money can buy.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.595
You know, you wanna get
rid of something, drink that.

22:15.682 --> 22:18.859
Um, we're finding a
route down to Quito.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.252
But there's a chance that
the storms might block access

22:21.340 --> 22:23.516
to the Poles making
GPS inaccessible.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.692
You could help us out
a little bit if you...

22:25.779 --> 22:27.824
If I can get
my computer back up,

22:27.911 --> 22:30.653
I can lock on to
your phone signal.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.699
I'll keep an eye
on you guys, okay?

22:32.786 --> 22:35.310
Make sure you're on the
right path at least

22:35.397 --> 22:37.094
until the ice wall
hits the Poles.

22:37.181 --> 22:39.836
And I'll keep you posted
on where the storm is.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.621
Perfect, Reggie.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.405
You're welcome and, trust me,

22:43.492 --> 22:45.668
I'll have that drink the second
I find the bottle, okay?

22:45.755 --> 22:47.104
Cheers, mate.

22:47.191 --> 22:49.280
Cheers. Over and out.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.152
Over and out, Jill.
Thank you.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.380
Whoa!

23:31.975 --> 23:33.412
All set.
You got the cure?

23:42.333 --> 23:43.552
All tucked away.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.162
All right.

23:45.249 --> 23:46.599
Let's go.

23:54.868 --> 23:55.825
Hello?

23:55.912 --> 23:56.826
Where are you?

23:56.913 --> 23:58.741
Almost at the airport.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.830
Then we're heading south just
like the Emergency Service said.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.789
Don't wait!
You need to get to Ecuador now!

24:02.876 --> 24:05.139
Ecuador? What? Why?

24:05.226 --> 24:08.055
A wall of ice is going
to completely freeze the planet

24:08.142 --> 24:11.362
in 24 hours except for
100 miles around the equator.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.016
There's a massive
ice storm ahead of it,

24:13.103 --> 24:14.235
so you need to go.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.279
I need to wait for Mike.

24:15.366 --> 24:16.977
Sara, listen to me!

24:17.064 --> 24:19.719
We're driving to the
American Embassy in Quito.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.982
You need to meet us there
in less than 24 hours!

24:22.069 --> 24:23.810
It's your only chance
to be safe from the storm!

24:23.897 --> 24:26.421
I can't leave Mike behind.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.771
They should be
landing any minute now.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.294
Do you know where his plane is?

24:30.381 --> 24:32.209
There hasn't been an update.

24:32.296 --> 24:34.385
Pick him up, then hurry!

24:35.909 --> 24:37.345
I love you.

24:37.432 --> 24:38.477
Love you, too.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.574
Hey, Mike, I'm almost there!

24:48.661 --> 24:51.098
-Sara, the plane's going down!
-What?

24:51.185 --> 24:53.622
We can't hear the engines.
I think we're losing altitude!

24:53.709 --> 24:55.711
Is there any shrapnel
in the fuselage?

24:55.798 --> 24:57.234
What?

24:57.321 --> 24:58.453
Did anything fly from
the engine

24:58.540 --> 24:59.889
and puncture the fuselage?

24:59.976 --> 25:02.022
Um, maybe!
I don't know!

25:02.109 --> 25:04.024
If there's any shrapnel
on the side of the plane,

25:04.111 --> 25:06.461
you may be losing pressure which
means you'll most likely crash.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.811
I don't know!

25:08.898 --> 25:11.118
But there's ice on the wing
and on the engine!

25:11.205 --> 25:13.076
Okay.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.513
Then your plane probably just
lost some power in steering,

25:14.600 --> 25:16.166
which is bad.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.125
But, hopefully, your pilot
still has enough control

25:18.212 --> 25:19.561
to keep the plane level.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.695
How far are you
from the exit row?

25:22.782 --> 25:24.784
Sara, we're not jumping
out of the plane!

25:24.871 --> 25:26.699
Mike, I was trained on
how to survive crashes

25:26.786 --> 25:29.528
while I was in the Navy.
I know what I'm talking about.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.225
Okay.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.749
How far are you from
the exit row?

25:33.836 --> 25:37.231
Um, maybe like five or six rows.

25:37.318 --> 25:39.494
Which is it?
Five or six?

25:39.581 --> 25:41.278
-Five.
-Five. We're five rows away.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.063
Five. Okay, good.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.978
You'll need to remember
that in case there's smoke

25:45.065 --> 25:47.067
after the crash and you
can't see the exit signs.

25:47.154 --> 25:49.983
Are you in the middle,
aisle or window seat?

25:50.070 --> 25:52.725
We're in the middle,
but there's no one in the other.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.553
The plane's really empty.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.990
Good.
Now ping me your GPS location.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.208
I'll come find you and
I will get you out of there

25:58.295 --> 25:59.732
as fast as I can.

26:02.169 --> 26:05.041
Got it.
I'm on my way.

26:05.128 --> 26:07.174
Okay.

26:07.261 --> 26:08.218
Thank you, Sara.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.090
I love you.

26:10.177 --> 26:11.570
I love you, too.

26:19.926 --> 26:22.058
We can survive this.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.364
You're right.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.984
It's freakin' cold out there.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.377
Do you really think we
can make it

26:36.464 --> 26:37.378
all the way from here
to Ecuador?

26:37.465 --> 26:38.684
What choice do we have?

26:41.556 --> 26:44.211
The longer we sit here and
talk about how we're gonna die,

26:44.298 --> 26:45.560
more likely we are.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.170
Yeah.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.085
Earth's about to turn
into ice planet Hoth.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.103
-I love you!
-I love you!

27:14.720 --> 27:17.810
Heh, batteries.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.029
I need batteries.
That's for sure.

27:20.116 --> 27:23.380
Oh, wire.

27:23.467 --> 27:24.947
I need copper wire.

27:25.034 --> 27:29.169
I should have paid
attention in shop class.

27:29.256 --> 27:32.651
Wait a second.
I'm not as dumb as I think I am.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.576
Perfect.
That should do it.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.275
GPS says they're at Bracken
Cave, about an hour from here.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.451
I'm sure police and fire
are already there.

27:50.538 --> 27:53.062
Does he have
"Find My Phone" turned on?

27:53.149 --> 27:54.629
You could at least find
out where he is.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.457
He doesn't have
his phone on, period.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.984
Just... he better be okay.

28:02.071 --> 28:04.073
He will be.
Just get there.

28:04.160 --> 28:07.947
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

28:08.034 --> 28:10.993
All right, Mike,
I'm coming for you.

28:23.353 --> 28:24.703
Mm.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.362
Mike?

28:33.494 --> 28:34.713
Mike?

28:36.236 --> 28:37.716
Mike?

28:40.631 --> 28:42.155
We have to get out of here.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.812
Uh...

28:49.597 --> 28:51.381
Right.

28:51.468 --> 28:52.731
Let's...

28:53.688 --> 28:56.038
Oh, no.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.175
It's freezing.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.743
Where is everyone?

29:12.272 --> 29:13.708
You okay?

29:13.795 --> 29:17.538
I think...
I think my hand's broken.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.411
Ooh, ow. Ah.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.244
My sister said we need to go.

29:28.331 --> 29:29.419
So let's...

29:39.255 --> 29:41.214
Are you okay?

29:43.651 --> 29:46.480
I don't think so.

29:46.567 --> 29:49.613
There were others,
but they left...

29:49.700 --> 29:52.225
-without me.
-Come on.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.632
Is there an emergency kit
somewhere?

30:08.719 --> 30:10.069
I have to stop this bleeding.

30:20.296 --> 30:21.602
Okay.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.826
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

30:30.785 --> 30:34.267
Okay, here. Better?

30:34.354 --> 30:36.269
A little.

30:36.356 --> 30:37.836
Don't worry.
I'll get us out of here.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.056
Help is on the way.

30:41.143 --> 30:42.536
Try not to move, okay?

30:42.623 --> 30:44.146
Uh-huh.

30:50.283 --> 30:52.807
No.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.549
I thought you said
the others left.

30:55.636 --> 30:58.639
That was a while ago.

30:58.726 --> 31:02.077
The ice must have blocked...

31:03.426 --> 31:04.775
Frozen over the exit.

31:07.082 --> 31:10.259
Andrea?
This really hurts.

31:10.346 --> 31:12.522
I can't breathe too well.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.962
Oh! Oh!

31:17.049 --> 31:20.008
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.923
You may have some
internal bleeding.

31:32.412 --> 31:34.283
All right.

31:34.370 --> 31:37.808
This will help prevent you
from going into shock,

31:37.896 --> 31:39.332
keep you nice and warm.

31:45.033 --> 31:50.604
But your hand, I'm going
to have to wrap it for now.

31:50.691 --> 31:51.910
Try not to move it, okay?

31:56.305 --> 31:57.916
Think I'll be able
to play piano again?

32:00.309 --> 32:03.399
Let's worry about getting
out of here first.

32:03.486 --> 32:06.925
Then we'll get you back to
playing the piano for me.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.494
Okay?

32:11.581 --> 32:13.105
How we looking so far?

32:20.895 --> 32:23.071
We have to pick up the pace.

32:23.158 --> 32:24.725
The roads are iced over.

32:24.812 --> 32:26.857
If we crash and the vial
containing the cure

32:26.945 --> 32:28.947
gets damaged or broken,
we're done for.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.302
-Oh!
-My God!

32:47.139 --> 32:49.141
Ah!

32:56.148 --> 32:57.758
Are you okay?

32:57.845 --> 32:59.978
Yeah, yeah.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.770
Hey, you've reached
the voicemail of Mike.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.554
Please leave a message.

33:11.641 --> 33:12.686
Doesn't mean anything.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.995
I'm freezing.

33:21.477 --> 33:22.609
No service.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.004
Looks like we can't
call for help.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.616
There has to be something
in here we can use

33:29.703 --> 33:31.270
to get through the ice.

33:43.499 --> 33:45.110
That must be them.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.745
I can't get a
read on where we are.

34:11.832 --> 34:13.268
Okay, hold on.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.229
Reggie?

34:19.274 --> 34:20.841
Reggie, do you copy?
Over.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.062
Copy. What is it, Jill?
Over.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.933
Are you able to track the storm?

34:26.020 --> 34:28.979
Hang on.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.460
It's about halfway through
Alaska and the territories.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.767
And it's coming
right toward you.

34:33.854 --> 34:36.509
It's in Canada now,
so it's moving your way.

34:41.296 --> 34:42.819
We're starting
to lose GPS already.

34:42.906 --> 34:44.125
Do you have a lock on us yet?

34:44.212 --> 34:45.822
Just about.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.389
With the power down,
I've had to resort to using

34:47.476 --> 34:50.479
a trick from my old hacker days.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.220
So you've locked onto
her cell location

34:52.307 --> 34:54.701
and using its motion sensors
to track where we're at?

34:54.788 --> 34:57.225
Yeah, exactly.
How do you know that?

34:57.312 --> 34:58.400
I've dabbled in
some light hacking.

34:58.487 --> 35:00.228
Nothing major.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.100
But, yeah, you should
know where we're at now.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.320
In about three miles, there
should be

35:05.407 --> 35:06.930
a fork in the road, okay?

35:07.017 --> 35:08.671
Now you take a right
and that should get you

35:08.758 --> 35:10.717
back on the track, okay?
You got me?

35:11.805 --> 35:13.981
Three miles, take a right.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.374
Copy that.

35:27.690 --> 35:28.909
Uh, Reggie?

35:32.217 --> 35:34.219
What if I can't turn right?

35:34.306 --> 35:36.525
You have to go right, okay?

35:36.612 --> 35:38.832
Left takes you up a mountain
without an easy exit.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.486
You have to go to the top,

35:40.573 --> 35:42.531
then work your way
down the other side.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.403
I'd really advise against it.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.622
Go right.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.842
We have to go left.
There's no other choice.

35:51.714 --> 35:55.022
Sorry, Reggie.
We have to go left. Over.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.634
My only advice
then would be to

35:58.721 --> 36:01.637
take it as fast as you
can to make up time. Over.

36:01.724 --> 36:03.944
Roger that.
Over and out.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.953
We're taking the mountain pass.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.654
Mike?

36:18.741 --> 36:20.047
Andrea?

36:22.049 --> 36:23.790
Mike?

36:26.184 --> 36:28.011
Andrea?

36:40.023 --> 36:41.503
Still nothing?

36:44.376 --> 36:46.726
I feel like we're grave-robbing.

36:46.813 --> 36:49.990
I know... it's weird.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.561
But this is survival.

37:03.743 --> 37:05.223
Come on!

37:09.401 --> 37:11.054
This is perfect.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.205
So be honest.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.902
Do you think I'll be
able to play again?

37:35.209 --> 37:39.518
I'm more worried about infection

37:39.605 --> 37:41.650
or internal bleeding.

37:43.217 --> 37:45.175
But if I had to guess,

37:45.263 --> 37:49.092
I'd say you'll be serenading us
in just a few weeks.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.069
You remember
the first night we met?

38:10.723 --> 38:12.768
How could I forget?

38:15.205 --> 38:17.817
A girlfriend of mine asked if
I wanted to go see a concert

38:17.904 --> 38:20.907
and I thought...

38:20.994 --> 38:24.693
she meant
a band or a DJ set.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.130
I didn't know
she meant a piano recital.

38:27.217 --> 38:30.917
Hey, it was standing room only.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.440
You're lucky you got in.

38:34.094 --> 38:37.793
You played Chopin
Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.404
One of my favorites.

38:40.622 --> 38:42.015
And now it's one of mine.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.421
Mike?

38:56.508 --> 38:58.336
Andrea?

39:00.947 --> 39:02.775
God, they should be here.

39:06.300 --> 39:09.042
Should be here.
Damn it!

39:13.176 --> 39:15.614
Is that Chopin?

39:15.701 --> 39:16.702
Mike!

39:19.400 --> 39:21.097
Mike? Mike!

39:21.184 --> 39:22.447
Sara?

39:22.534 --> 39:24.231
Yeah? Where are you?

39:24.318 --> 39:26.059
We're here!

39:26.146 --> 39:29.584
The plane broke in half.
We're under some... like ice!

39:29.671 --> 39:30.846
Mike's hurt!

39:30.933 --> 39:32.152
Okay, I'm getting you out!

39:36.548 --> 39:37.679
We're almost out of here.

39:42.467 --> 39:46.819
I... I don't think
I can go on.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.439
No...

40:07.013 --> 40:10.190
Andrea, I...

40:14.281 --> 40:15.587
Let's...

40:23.508 --> 40:24.900
Let's get out of here.

40:26.728 --> 40:30.166
I'm coming for you!
I'm almost there!

40:30.253 --> 40:31.690
Don't worry, I got it.

40:45.486 --> 40:48.358
Guys, this digging is
taking way too long!

40:48.446 --> 40:51.100
Do you have anything in there
that can help you get out?

40:51.187 --> 40:52.450
Uh...

40:56.062 --> 40:58.064
No. There's nothing.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.982
Stand back.

41:03.069 --> 41:04.636
Mike, stop!

41:10.076 --> 41:12.078
What were you thinking?

41:12.165 --> 41:13.732
You could have
punctured your lung!

41:13.819 --> 41:16.343
We have to get out of here.

41:47.896 --> 41:49.985
Mike, oh!

41:50.072 --> 41:51.552
I can't believe I found you!

42:02.476 --> 42:05.958
Andrea! Andrea!
Oh!

42:07.786 --> 42:09.396
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

42:09.483 --> 42:10.702
You, too.

42:10.789 --> 42:12.051
We have to get out of here.

42:12.138 --> 42:13.748
Okay. But we need
to hurry anyways.

42:13.835 --> 42:15.620
I'll explain everything
in the car.

42:15.707 --> 42:16.708
Okay.

42:20.146 --> 42:22.801
We're almost back on schedule.
You're doing pretty good time.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.846
Help me look for anything
that might be ice.

42:24.933 --> 42:27.719
We can't afford
to spin out up here.

42:44.779 --> 42:46.825
Oh, no.

42:46.912 --> 42:48.348
Jill!

42:48.435 --> 42:50.263
It's in Seattle now!

42:50.350 --> 42:52.308
You need to move faster.

42:52.395 --> 42:55.921
You need to move faster if you
want to beat that wall of ice!

42:56.008 --> 42:57.923
We have to get you
in Tribuga

42:58.010 --> 43:00.795
in less than four hours
to keep pace!

43:00.882 --> 43:03.406
I'll try, but I don't
wanna push it.

43:03.493 --> 43:05.234
We can't afford to have
an accident up here.

43:11.980 --> 43:14.592
Oh! Hold on!

43:17.812 --> 43:19.466
Oh...

43:30.564 --> 43:32.218
Jill!

43:34.089 --> 43:35.395
Jill?

43:38.833 --> 43:40.226
Jill?

43:41.183 --> 43:43.229
Jill!

43:55.807 --> 43:57.635
Oscar?

43:57.722 --> 44:00.202
Hey, Oscar? Oscar.

44:00.289 --> 44:01.377
Hey, hey, hey.

44:01.464 --> 44:03.031
Hey, Oscar, wake up!

44:03.118 --> 44:05.947
Oscar, open your eyes!

44:06.034 --> 44:08.210
I'm cold.

44:08.297 --> 44:10.648
Hey, you okay?

44:13.041 --> 44:14.434
Okay.

44:18.220 --> 44:22.834
Oh, no, no, no!
No, no...

44:22.921 --> 44:24.662
Damn it!

44:27.534 --> 44:28.840
We have to find another car.

44:28.927 --> 44:30.580
Otherwise, we're gonna
freeze to death.

44:30.668 --> 44:33.105
Jill, the cure, the cure,
the cure, the cure!

44:46.118 --> 44:47.467
Um...

44:48.860 --> 44:51.253
Let's get moving.

45:09.663 --> 45:11.273
Jill, Oscar.

45:11.360 --> 45:13.711
Come on, come on.

45:13.798 --> 45:16.496
Move.

45:16.583 --> 45:18.716
Don't be dead.
Come on, one of you guys move.

45:20.108 --> 45:21.501
Move!

45:28.290 --> 45:30.989
Oh, thank God, thank God.

45:35.254 --> 45:37.038
A truck!

45:41.042 --> 45:42.783
Phew.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.624
Okay.

45:57.711 --> 45:58.973
You okay?

46:00.714 --> 46:03.848
Here, let's get
you inside, okay?

46:03.935 --> 46:05.632
Come on.

46:06.633 --> 46:08.200
It's too cold out here.

46:13.161 --> 46:14.641
Here we go.

46:17.383 --> 46:18.688
Okay, okay.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.473
Don't come any closer!

46:20.560 --> 46:22.736
We don't have anything of value!
We're infected!

46:22.823 --> 46:25.478
Look, we were just
in an accident.

46:25.565 --> 46:27.001
My friend's really hurt!

46:27.088 --> 46:28.481
Try the hospital
a few miles down the road,

46:28.568 --> 46:30.265
but you can't stay here.

46:30.352 --> 46:33.399
Look, we're from the HHS Lab.

46:33.486 --> 46:35.096
We have a cure for the virus.

46:35.183 --> 46:37.359
We have to get to Ecuador
immediately

46:37.446 --> 46:39.492
or else everyone who
survives the evacuations

46:39.579 --> 46:41.624
is gonna be dead in
a matter of months!

46:44.584 --> 46:46.238
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

46:54.246 --> 46:55.638
I got it, I got it, I got it.

46:57.031 --> 46:58.380
Here.

47:01.035 --> 47:02.297
We have the cure, sir.

47:11.219 --> 47:13.439
Well, you can't come
in the house!

47:13.526 --> 47:15.397
But you can bring your friend
around to the workshop.

47:15.484 --> 47:17.182
I'll go get the first aid kit.

47:18.226 --> 47:19.488
Thank you.

47:23.318 --> 47:24.711
Okay, here, let's go.

47:31.326 --> 47:33.198
Okay, take him right over
to the table.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.201
Can you hop up?

47:38.029 --> 47:39.682
Hop on up.

47:42.424 --> 47:44.209
Where are you cut, son?

47:54.088 --> 47:56.308
Oh, this shouldn't
be too much trouble.

47:56.395 --> 47:58.658
Why don't you lie down right
here for me, all right?

47:58.745 --> 48:00.442
Okay.

48:06.709 --> 48:10.452
My wife was a vet by trade

48:10.539 --> 48:13.891
and I used to assist
her from time to time.

48:26.991 --> 48:29.210
You said your wife was a vet?

48:29.297 --> 48:32.735
Yep. Horses, primarily.

48:32.822 --> 48:34.302
Moved down here years ago

48:34.389 --> 48:36.957
when the area was in need
of a livestock vet.

48:37.044 --> 48:38.872
Was a match made in heaven.

48:38.959 --> 48:40.918
She could fix up
any of my horses,

48:41.005 --> 48:44.269
and she always gave me
a pretty good discount.

48:44.356 --> 48:46.793
One more, son.

48:47.881 --> 48:49.491
Good, good, good.

48:53.495 --> 48:55.715
All done.

48:55.802 --> 48:58.065
Now take it easy for
a minute or they'll tear.

48:58.152 --> 49:00.415
I don't do second
stitches for free.

49:02.113 --> 49:03.462
No, no, no, son.

49:03.549 --> 49:05.072
You wanna take it easy
for a minute.

49:05.159 --> 49:06.595
Last thing you need
is an infection.

49:08.510 --> 49:10.904
You look like you could use
a cup of coffee.

49:10.991 --> 49:12.862
No. We don't have
time, sir.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.647
There's always time
for a cup of joe.

49:17.171 --> 49:19.608
Not gonna make it to the equator
without being caffeinated.

49:22.350 --> 49:24.918
Why haven't you
evacuated south yet?

49:25.005 --> 49:28.661
My wife.
She's sick.

49:28.748 --> 49:29.705
Can't move her.

49:29.792 --> 49:31.272
She's pretty far gone.

49:31.359 --> 49:33.100
Can hardly breathe anymore.

49:33.187 --> 49:36.756
She'd be on a ventilator
if she could, but, well...

49:38.149 --> 49:39.977
How do you know you're not sick?

49:40.064 --> 49:44.198
Well, I keep my distance,
wear a mask, wash my hands.

49:44.285 --> 49:46.809
I only see her once a night
while she's sleeping.

49:46.896 --> 49:49.682
Read to her from her
favorite books.

49:49.769 --> 49:51.684
Don't know if she
can hear me, though.

49:51.771 --> 49:53.991
But if you stay...

49:54.078 --> 49:55.905
If we stay, we'll be together.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.386
When you've been married
as long as we have,

49:58.473 --> 49:59.822
that's all you can hope for.

50:03.217 --> 50:04.958
I hope your wife is comfortable.

50:05.045 --> 50:07.004
Comfortable as one can be,
considering.

50:09.093 --> 50:11.312
Um, look, I hate
to bother you again,

50:11.399 --> 50:14.141
but do you have any
tools I can borrow?

50:14.228 --> 50:16.100
Depends.
What are you looking to fix?

50:16.187 --> 50:17.623
A ham radio.

50:17.710 --> 50:19.581
It got damaged in the crash

50:19.668 --> 50:21.627
and we need it working
before we can leave.

50:21.714 --> 50:23.585
Should have everything you need
over on this workbench

50:23.672 --> 50:25.283
if you wanna take a look.

50:25.370 --> 50:26.501
-Yeah, can I?
-Mm-hm.

50:33.073 --> 50:36.685
So we have to get to
Ecuador in less than a day.

50:36.772 --> 50:38.252
That's right.

50:40.515 --> 50:42.561
Any hospitals coming up?

50:42.648 --> 50:44.519
None that I can see.

50:44.606 --> 50:46.391
Wouldn't they have taken
any medications with them

50:46.478 --> 50:48.219
in their evacuation?

50:48.306 --> 50:50.395
No. If this was a fast Evac,

50:50.482 --> 50:52.658
they would have a
lot of med stockpiled.

50:52.745 --> 50:54.355
There's a chance we'll find
whatever they couldn't take

50:54.442 --> 50:56.053
with them at a larger hospital.

50:57.576 --> 50:59.404
Mike!

50:59.491 --> 51:01.623
Mike, how do you feel?

51:01.710 --> 51:03.234
Mike?

51:03.321 --> 51:05.627
Mike?

51:08.848 --> 51:10.719
Damn it!
It's pure ice!

51:13.244 --> 51:14.680
Hang on!

51:21.295 --> 51:23.210
Are you guys all right?

51:23.297 --> 51:25.691
I'm all right. I'm...

51:25.778 --> 51:27.693
Andrea? Are you okay?

51:27.780 --> 51:30.043
I'm okay.
I'm better than okay.

51:30.130 --> 51:31.784
Look!

51:40.097 --> 51:41.707
This wall of ice isn't
supposed to start moving

51:41.794 --> 51:44.013
for another 14 hours.

51:48.714 --> 51:50.933
Reggie to Jill?

51:51.020 --> 51:53.545
This is Reggie to Jill!
Can you hear me? Over.

52:02.467 --> 52:05.296
Why do you need
this radio working?

52:05.383 --> 52:07.472
Well... the GPS isn't working

52:07.559 --> 52:09.822
'cause the poles
are completely out of whack.

52:09.909 --> 52:12.303
But I got a contact
who has a fix on us.

52:16.481 --> 52:18.135
Can you hand me the leads?

52:30.364 --> 52:31.713
It's getting there.

52:39.330 --> 52:42.071
Got to turn him to his side!
Get his shoulder!

52:42.159 --> 52:45.031
Now do it!
One, two, three!

52:46.511 --> 52:48.034
Is he on any medications

52:48.121 --> 52:49.340
or have any allergies
that you're aware of?

52:49.427 --> 52:50.906
No, no.
I don't think so.

52:50.993 --> 52:52.604
Then he must have
had a concussion.

52:55.389 --> 52:56.303
What do we do?

52:56.390 --> 52:57.652
Just have wait it out.

52:59.001 --> 53:00.699
I think it's over.

53:00.786 --> 53:03.354
Pull up his shirt.
I need to check his stitches.

53:07.140 --> 53:08.576
It's infected.

53:08.663 --> 53:10.361
I have to pull
them out immediately,

53:10.448 --> 53:13.146
clean it out and try again.

53:13.233 --> 53:15.540
Well, tell me what
I can do to help.

53:15.627 --> 53:17.933
Do you have any kind
of disinfectant,

53:18.020 --> 53:21.067
nail polish remover
or mouthwash?

53:21.154 --> 53:22.764
Yeah.
I have something.

53:22.851 --> 53:23.983
Okay.

53:25.550 --> 53:27.334
Shoot.

53:27.421 --> 53:29.684
Come on, come on.

53:29.771 --> 53:30.903
I know it's in here somewhere.

53:33.601 --> 53:34.689
Yes!

53:35.995 --> 53:37.823
That'll do.

53:52.272 --> 53:54.361
Okay.

53:54.448 --> 53:55.623
All right.

53:57.190 --> 53:59.018
You may not want to watch this.

54:05.633 --> 54:07.940
I hate to be that person,
but a morgue seems

54:08.027 --> 54:09.855
like the place you would
go when it's too late.

54:09.942 --> 54:11.683
Morgues are medical facilities.

54:11.770 --> 54:13.162
They still have some amount
of medicines on hand

54:13.250 --> 54:14.903
to treat people.

54:14.990 --> 54:17.471
It's usually not much,
but there's a chance.

54:17.558 --> 54:20.213
And what if there aren't any?

54:20.300 --> 54:21.823
It's the best shot we've got.

54:24.609 --> 54:26.045
Lead the way.

54:26.132 --> 54:27.612
This way.

54:31.485 --> 54:33.052
Must be broken windows
or something.

54:33.139 --> 54:35.794
Just be careful what you touch.

54:35.881 --> 54:37.099
Where do you think
they keep the medications?

54:37.186 --> 54:38.710
In the back.
Let's go.

54:39.798 --> 54:41.103
Okay...

54:41.190 --> 54:42.496
Let's give this is a shot.

54:48.285 --> 54:52.201
Reggie? Do you copy?
Over.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.987
Reggie!
Come in, Reggie! Over.

54:56.293 --> 54:57.859
Jill, what happened to you guys?

54:59.383 --> 55:00.645
We hit a patch
of ice and crashed,

55:00.732 --> 55:04.562
but we're okay
for the most part.

55:04.649 --> 55:06.085
Everything okay over there?

55:07.695 --> 55:09.828
I have some bad news.

55:09.915 --> 55:10.916
What is it?

55:12.700 --> 55:14.876
There's been a huge
pressure swing here.

55:14.963 --> 55:18.619
The second ice wall is
gonna be starting earlier.

55:21.579 --> 55:24.712
It's not supposed to hit the
Poles for another 15 hours.

55:24.799 --> 55:28.586
And it's not supposed to reach
us for at least another 13.

55:28.673 --> 55:30.631
Look, by my estimate,
the second ice wall

55:30.718 --> 55:33.068
will start here
in about two hours,

55:33.155 --> 55:35.462
reach you in 11,
which gives you

55:35.549 --> 55:37.638
nine hours to beat
the first ice wall.

55:37.725 --> 55:38.987
Got it?

55:40.989 --> 55:42.817
Reggie, I don't...

55:42.904 --> 55:44.819
Sorry to interrupt.
He's up.

55:44.906 --> 55:46.560
I think he's gonna recover.
Stitches look good.

55:48.997 --> 55:51.348
Reggie, we're hitting the road.
Over and out.

55:51.435 --> 55:53.132
Good luck.
Over and out.

55:59.704 --> 56:02.402
Hey, Jill.
What'd I miss?

56:03.925 --> 56:05.405
Don't you ever scare
me like that again.

56:06.711 --> 56:07.929
Don't count on it.

56:10.367 --> 56:13.718
Robert, we, uh... need a car.

56:13.805 --> 56:15.850
Do you know of anyone who
might have left one behind?

56:15.937 --> 56:17.852
Can't say as I do,

56:17.939 --> 56:21.247
although I might know
of a car you can use.

56:21.334 --> 56:22.988
Whose?

56:23.075 --> 56:24.946
Spare gallons of gas
and chains in the back.

56:25.033 --> 56:27.601
It's all yours.

56:27.688 --> 56:30.517
We have the cure,
enough for your wife.

56:30.604 --> 56:31.649
You can come with us.

56:31.736 --> 56:33.390
No. It's way too late for us.

56:33.477 --> 56:35.087
We'd only slow you down.

56:35.174 --> 56:36.523
And, besides, this storm's
gonna take us out

56:36.610 --> 56:38.133
before too long anyway.

56:38.220 --> 56:40.005
But if you can get
the cure to everyone,

56:40.092 --> 56:41.746
you can save the world.

56:41.833 --> 56:44.618
I think that's worth my truck

56:44.705 --> 56:46.751
and some alone time
comforting my wife.

56:53.192 --> 56:54.672
Be safe.

57:00.634 --> 57:01.722
Thank you.

57:03.202 --> 57:05.334
You take care, son.
Take care of her.

57:06.640 --> 57:10.339
Oh, don't forget your whisky.

57:10.427 --> 57:12.429
Why don't you hang onto that?

57:12.516 --> 57:14.605
Call us even?

57:14.692 --> 57:16.998
Cheers.
I'll get the door for you.

57:26.617 --> 57:28.009
Thank you, Robert.

57:33.145 --> 57:34.625
Reggie, come in.

57:34.712 --> 57:37.062
Do you know where
the ice wall is now? Over.

57:37.149 --> 57:39.456
Yeah, it should be passing over San Antonio right now.

57:41.806 --> 57:42.894
Sara.

57:49.248 --> 57:51.555
-Gimme a second.
-Okay.

57:51.642 --> 57:54.340
Do you think they're occupied?

57:54.427 --> 57:56.777
We'll be in them soon enough
if I don't find some medicine.

57:58.387 --> 58:00.215
But, actually,
they're insulated

58:00.302 --> 58:02.479
so it wouldn't be
the worst place for us.

58:04.524 --> 58:06.221
Okay, should be
somewhere in here.

58:06.308 --> 58:07.527
Mike, hold onto this.

58:13.098 --> 58:14.665
The wind's getting stronger.

58:14.752 --> 58:16.667
That's not the wind.

58:16.754 --> 58:18.973
This is the first ice storm
Jill warned us about!

58:24.631 --> 58:25.806
What do we do?

58:25.893 --> 58:26.807
Get in the drawer now!

58:26.894 --> 58:28.243
Won't we get stuck?

58:28.330 --> 58:29.506
This is the only way
we'll survive!

58:29.593 --> 58:31.290
Come on!

58:32.683 --> 58:34.598
Hurry!

58:34.685 --> 58:36.208
-You guys okay?
-Yes!

58:38.906 --> 58:40.299
We're good.

58:42.693 --> 58:43.911
Careful.

58:51.702 --> 58:52.964
What are you waiting for?

58:53.051 --> 58:54.400
How did you get it
to slide in?

58:54.487 --> 58:55.619
It's stuck? Pull!

59:23.211 --> 59:24.909
Get to Ecuador.

59:24.996 --> 59:26.127
I love you!

59:39.793 --> 59:41.752
Andrea!

59:52.371 --> 59:53.764
You okay?

1:00:06.341 --> 1:00:07.386
Damn it!

1:00:09.431 --> 1:00:11.216
We can find another road.

1:00:11.303 --> 1:00:15.176
Really? Where?
Where is there another road?

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:22.096
Reggie, do you copy? Over.

1:00:22.183 --> 1:00:24.969
Copy! What do you need?
Over.

1:00:25.056 --> 1:00:27.536
How much time do we have
and where should we be going?

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:29.843
We're stuck behind
a wall of ice!

1:00:29.930 --> 1:00:32.106
Well, the storm is heading
into Mexico now.

1:00:32.193 --> 1:00:34.326
And you guys should be
entering

1:00:34.413 --> 1:00:36.720
into northern Ecuador
at about, uh...

1:00:36.807 --> 1:00:38.069
within the hour.

1:00:38.156 --> 1:00:39.810
You just have just
over seven hours

1:00:39.897 --> 1:00:41.376
before the first ice wall hits.

1:00:41.463 --> 1:00:44.031
And nine before
the second one does.

1:00:44.118 --> 1:00:47.992
So as for what direction,
stick to the coast.

1:00:48.079 --> 1:00:50.211
It's a shame you can't drive
over the ocean,

1:00:50.298 --> 1:00:52.736
but, uh, cars sink, you know.

1:00:52.823 --> 1:00:55.521
Thank you again, Reggie,
for everything.

1:00:55.608 --> 1:00:57.131
I was, uh...

1:01:00.395 --> 1:01:03.660
No, no!

1:01:03.747 --> 1:01:05.792
Oh... It's here!

1:01:05.879 --> 1:01:08.142
It's here!

1:01:08.229 --> 1:01:10.101
The second wall of ice is here!

1:01:10.188 --> 1:01:11.102
Reggie!

1:01:11.189 --> 1:01:12.756
Oh, no!

1:01:12.843 --> 1:01:15.367
I guess I was wrong
about the safe zone!

1:01:17.282 --> 1:01:18.675
Reggie, no!

1:01:43.525 --> 1:01:46.790
We have to keep going.

1:01:46.877 --> 1:01:48.705
But we're stuck

1:01:48.792 --> 1:01:51.142
and our only path to Ecuador
is completely blocked.

1:01:52.143 --> 1:01:54.449
Wait. Is that...

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:57.148
Is that the ocean?

1:02:03.850 --> 1:02:07.375
You know, Reggie may
have been on to something.

1:02:07.462 --> 1:02:09.377
With the roads just
getting harder and harder

1:02:09.464 --> 1:02:12.990
to drive on and GPS not
functioning whatsoever...

1:02:15.209 --> 1:02:17.472
You're not actually
suggesting we drive

1:02:17.559 --> 1:02:19.561
over the ocean, are you?

1:02:19.648 --> 1:02:21.259
Why not?

1:02:21.346 --> 1:02:23.696
It should be frozen solid,
at least by the shore

1:02:23.783 --> 1:02:26.090
where it's shallowest.

1:02:26.177 --> 1:02:28.701
We could just follow the coast.

1:02:28.788 --> 1:02:32.270
We don't know how
far down frozen it is!

1:02:32.357 --> 1:02:33.750
We should be all right
as long as we stay within

1:02:33.837 --> 1:02:35.752
30 to 50 feet from the shore.

1:02:37.841 --> 1:02:39.886
Okay.

1:02:39.973 --> 1:02:41.366
Okay.

1:02:49.940 --> 1:02:51.202
Careful.

1:02:54.945 --> 1:02:56.729
If I hear one creak
I don't like,

1:02:56.816 --> 1:02:58.775
we're dropping this and
heading straight for the shore.

1:03:32.286 --> 1:03:34.027
Mike?

1:03:34.114 --> 1:03:35.115
Can you hear me?

1:03:36.682 --> 1:03:38.510
Yes.

1:03:38.597 --> 1:03:40.729
Andrea.

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:42.906
What happened? Mike?

1:03:44.951 --> 1:03:47.693
She got up and closed
my drawer and...

1:03:49.303 --> 1:03:51.349
She...

1:03:51.436 --> 1:03:52.654
What do you mean?

1:03:56.397 --> 1:03:57.703
Hang on.

1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:00.184
Wait.

1:04:00.271 --> 1:04:02.403
Mike, can you get out?

1:04:02.490 --> 1:04:04.318
No.

1:04:04.405 --> 1:04:06.059
We're stuck.

1:04:06.146 --> 1:04:08.192
There has to be some kind
of emergency switch

1:04:08.279 --> 1:04:11.891
on these things so people
don't get stuck!

1:04:11.978 --> 1:04:14.633
Frozen from the outside, Sara.

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:16.156
We're stuck.

1:04:19.377 --> 1:04:21.945
Do you have anything on you
that can help us get out?

1:04:22.032 --> 1:04:23.381
I don't think so.

1:04:25.774 --> 1:04:27.864
You still smoke?

1:04:27.951 --> 1:04:31.389
I gave that up.
I really regret it right now.

1:04:31.476 --> 1:04:34.479
Wait a second.
I have an idea.

1:04:54.368 --> 1:04:56.066
I got it!

1:04:56.153 --> 1:04:57.328
Yes.

1:05:14.780 --> 1:05:15.868
Mike!

1:05:15.955 --> 1:05:17.174
Mike, we have to hurry!

1:05:20.307 --> 1:05:22.788
What are you doing?
Come on, Mike!

1:05:34.234 --> 1:05:35.627
What's happening out there?

1:05:35.714 --> 1:05:37.107
Try it now!

1:05:40.632 --> 1:05:42.373
Way to go, little bro!

1:05:50.772 --> 1:05:52.426
Mike...

1:05:53.862 --> 1:05:55.473
Mike...

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:59.129
Look, I hate to say this,
but we have to got to go.

1:05:59.216 --> 1:06:03.437
Look, if we don't leave now,
she gave her life for nothing.

1:06:06.701 --> 1:06:09.356
Let's go. We got to get
out of here, come on.

1:06:16.407 --> 1:06:17.408
How are we doing on time?

1:06:20.498 --> 1:06:23.370
A more direct path
would be faster.

1:06:23.457 --> 1:06:25.416
But we're pretty close
to being back on schedule.

1:06:27.157 --> 1:06:30.290
The storm will have hit
Costa Rica by now.

1:06:30.377 --> 1:06:31.726
That's where I went
to grad school.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:35.730
Now it's like it didn't
even happen.

1:06:35.817 --> 1:06:38.298
Oh...

1:06:38.385 --> 1:06:41.127
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:06:41.214 --> 1:06:43.086
Just getting over
my new surgery.

1:06:46.176 --> 1:06:48.439
We should try picking up speed.

1:06:48.526 --> 1:06:52.269
Try to do our best to get
as much ahead as possible.

1:06:52.356 --> 1:06:55.315
I don't know, Jill.
This is pure ice we're on.

1:06:55.402 --> 1:06:58.057
If the ice cracks
or if we sink, that's it,

1:06:58.144 --> 1:06:59.667
not just for us,
but for all of humanity.

1:06:59.754 --> 1:07:02.670
And we are still a ways
away from Ecuador.

1:07:02.757 --> 1:07:05.238
That's why we should go faster.

1:07:05.325 --> 1:07:07.719
We can regain some control
and make up for lost time.

1:07:10.069 --> 1:07:11.592
Okay.

1:07:11.679 --> 1:07:13.072
Go faster.

1:07:22.038 --> 1:07:22.951
A boat!

1:07:23.039 --> 1:07:24.605
I see...

1:07:24.692 --> 1:07:27.130
-A big boat!
-I know! I see it!

1:07:27.217 --> 1:07:28.479
Hang on.

1:07:34.833 --> 1:07:37.096
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1:07:38.924 --> 1:07:40.708
Floor it!

1:07:40.795 --> 1:07:42.493
-Get out!
-Onto the ice?

1:07:42.580 --> 1:07:44.408
If the truck sinks,
we're done for.

1:07:44.495 --> 1:07:45.713
Out!

1:07:58.335 --> 1:07:59.771
Jill! Jill!

1:08:00.728 --> 1:08:02.469
No!

1:08:12.349 --> 1:08:13.785
Let's go.

1:08:15.482 --> 1:08:17.049
We're walking the rest
of the way.

1:08:31.237 --> 1:08:33.631
And the last helicopter
evacuating from

1:08:33.718 --> 1:08:37.504
the southern Texas area
have taken off.

1:08:37.591 --> 1:08:38.810
Looks like there's
a hospital coming up,

1:08:38.897 --> 1:08:40.551
not too far from us now.

1:08:40.638 --> 1:08:42.901
Do you think they'll
actually have any medications?

1:08:42.988 --> 1:08:44.555
The bigger the hospital,
the better.

1:08:45.991 --> 1:08:47.340
No!

1:08:47.427 --> 1:08:50.430
No, no, no, no!
This can't be happening?

1:08:50.517 --> 1:08:52.345
Did you run out of gas?

1:08:52.432 --> 1:08:55.043
That ice wall must have
damaged something, damn it!

1:08:55.131 --> 1:08:56.262
Damn it!

1:08:58.525 --> 1:08:59.918
Can we fix it?

1:09:00.005 --> 1:09:02.094
Not in this weather.

1:09:02.181 --> 1:09:03.530
How far away is that hospital?

1:09:06.881 --> 1:09:08.187
How much further?

1:09:08.274 --> 1:09:12.191
We're about 20 miles in

1:09:12.278 --> 1:09:13.410
from where
the truck went down.

1:09:15.803 --> 1:09:19.633
Jill, you're shaking.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:25.204
Jill...

1:09:25.291 --> 1:09:26.684
You sure?

1:09:27.685 --> 1:09:29.382
Absolutely.

1:09:43.222 --> 1:09:46.051
I'm really sorry for
yelling at you back there.

1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:51.361
It wasn't your fault.

1:09:52.579 --> 1:09:54.364
Yes, it was.

1:09:57.193 --> 1:09:59.282
Jill, you were right!

1:09:59.369 --> 1:10:01.501
We had to make up time.
You were right, Jill!

1:10:01.588 --> 1:10:03.329
Stop it!

1:10:03.416 --> 1:10:05.853
Because of my decision, we may
have killed an entire race!

1:10:07.638 --> 1:10:08.987
It's entirely my fault.

1:10:10.293 --> 1:10:12.556
You are the smartest person
I know!

1:10:12.643 --> 1:10:14.819
The world needs you more than
anybody else living in it now!

1:10:14.906 --> 1:10:17.300
That is the problem, Oscar!

1:10:17.387 --> 1:10:19.998
I have been so focused on
my work and finding out

1:10:20.085 --> 1:10:21.956
what's been going on that
I have abandoned

1:10:22.043 --> 1:10:27.179
what's really important,
my friends, my family!

1:10:27.266 --> 1:10:31.836
Jill, when you and
your family

1:10:31.923 --> 1:10:34.142
are back in Ecuador,

1:10:34.230 --> 1:10:35.666
they'll be so happy to see you.

1:10:35.753 --> 1:10:37.407
Nothing else will matter!

1:10:41.889 --> 1:10:45.153
There is no way I could have
gone this far without you.

1:10:46.677 --> 1:10:48.069
Okay, come on.

1:10:50.158 --> 1:10:51.856
Let's go save the world.

1:11:06.349 --> 1:11:07.698
Okay. You're going to be okay.

1:11:08.786 --> 1:11:10.309
Here we go.

1:11:17.795 --> 1:11:21.015
You stay here, I'm going
to find some medications.

1:11:37.945 --> 1:11:40.252
Empty, empty.

1:11:48.913 --> 1:11:52.133
Okay.
Okay, okay, yes, yes.

1:11:54.179 --> 1:11:56.007
Come on.

1:11:58.488 --> 1:11:59.793
Bingo.

1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:01.317
Here we go.

1:12:15.374 --> 1:12:16.810
Agh!

1:12:16.897 --> 1:12:18.464
Maybe Mike can help
me with this.

1:12:20.510 --> 1:12:23.251
Mike, what are you doing?

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:24.644
You should be resting.

1:12:24.731 --> 1:12:25.776
I can rest when
we're in Ecuador.

1:12:25.863 --> 1:12:27.647
What do you need me to do?

1:12:27.734 --> 1:12:29.475
Help me break into this room.

1:12:40.573 --> 1:12:43.315
What do we do now?

1:12:43.402 --> 1:12:44.882
Maybe we can crawl
in through the air ducts.

1:12:44.969 --> 1:12:46.710
Go in from above?

1:12:46.797 --> 1:12:49.626
No9 way I'm getting into the
air ducts, not like this.

1:12:49.713 --> 1:12:51.932
There has to be something.
Someone, maybe.

1:12:52.019 --> 1:12:54.718
An emergency radio? A phone?
Someone we can contact?

1:12:54.805 --> 1:12:57.285
There has to be something or
somebody that can help us.

1:12:57.373 --> 1:13:00.680
Sara, help me grab this chair.

1:13:00.767 --> 1:13:02.334
Yes.

1:13:05.032 --> 1:13:07.078
You okay?

1:13:07.165 --> 1:13:08.340
Okay, you got it.

1:13:11.822 --> 1:13:13.214
Ready?

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:19.873
What are you doing?

1:13:22.049 --> 1:13:24.225
Do you hear that?

1:13:24.312 --> 1:13:25.575
Oh.

1:13:25.662 --> 1:13:27.925
Helicopter.
It's a helicopter!

1:13:28.012 --> 1:13:29.840
It's a helicopter,
come on!

1:13:36.107 --> 1:13:37.064
Help!

1:13:37.151 --> 1:13:38.979
-Help!
-Hey!

1:13:39.066 --> 1:13:40.024
-Hey, come back!
-Help!

1:13:40.111 --> 1:13:41.895
Come back!

1:13:41.982 --> 1:13:43.462
Hey!

1:13:45.203 --> 1:13:46.900
Yes.

1:13:46.987 --> 1:13:49.033
Hey!

1:13:55.822 --> 1:13:57.258
Yes....

1:13:57.345 --> 1:14:01.349
Hey! Hey!

1:14:01.437 --> 1:14:03.351
Yeah!

1:14:06.311 --> 1:14:08.269
Yes!

1:14:15.973 --> 1:14:20.020
We're about five hours away from
the second ice wall to hit us

1:14:20.107 --> 1:14:25.199
even though the first ice wall's
probably hit Panama City by now,

1:14:25.286 --> 1:14:26.897
pretty close to Quito.

1:14:26.984 --> 1:14:28.594
All we have to do is
keep heading south,

1:14:28.681 --> 1:14:31.641
which is...

1:14:31.728 --> 1:14:33.381
that direction.

1:14:34.557 --> 1:14:36.472
Let's do this.

1:14:48.962 --> 1:14:50.355
Okay.

1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:53.967
You hear that?

1:14:56.056 --> 1:14:57.101
Run!

1:14:57.188 --> 1:14:58.842
-No, climb!
-What?

1:14:58.929 --> 1:15:01.235
-Climb!
-Keep going, Jill!

1:15:05.979 --> 1:15:07.415
Jill, go!

1:15:09.809 --> 1:15:11.507
Here, take my hand!

1:15:11.594 --> 1:15:12.595
Just take my arm!

1:15:16.555 --> 1:15:18.122
Oscar!

1:15:32.658 --> 1:15:34.573
Oscar?

1:15:35.966 --> 1:15:37.663
Oscar?

1:15:41.754 --> 1:15:43.495
Oscar!

1:15:49.022 --> 1:15:50.371
Get away from me!

1:15:53.157 --> 1:15:56.856
-Take it easy.
-Don't touch me!

1:15:56.943 --> 1:15:59.076
I can get you sick.
I have it.

1:15:59.163 --> 1:16:02.383
Hey, I was a guinea pig
for this cure!

1:16:02.470 --> 1:16:03.950
You couldn't get me sick
if you tried!

1:16:05.735 --> 1:16:09.042
I can't keep going on.

1:16:09.129 --> 1:16:11.088
I'm tired.

1:16:11.175 --> 1:16:12.350
I'm done, Jill.

1:16:12.437 --> 1:16:15.396
Oscar, I need you.

1:16:19.575 --> 1:16:22.012
Don't waste it on me.

1:16:22.099 --> 1:16:24.710
I'd be taking it away
from the children.

1:16:24.797 --> 1:16:26.103
I can't like with that
on my conscience.

1:16:31.587 --> 1:16:32.892
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:16:32.979 --> 1:16:35.503
Half now, half
when we're in Quito.

1:16:37.854 --> 1:16:39.595
We can still use
what's left to make more.

1:16:39.682 --> 1:16:43.990
Honestly, you're the smartest
person I've ever met.

1:16:49.517 --> 1:16:53.043
Come on.
We gotta get moving.

1:16:54.740 --> 1:16:56.046
Ready?

1:16:56.133 --> 1:16:58.222
Here we go.
One, two, three, up!

1:17:26.206 --> 1:17:27.468
Jill?

1:17:28.165 --> 1:17:29.906
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:17:32.430 --> 1:17:33.779
Here. Take a break.

1:17:43.441 --> 1:17:46.487
Here. Put it on.

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:49.926
Thank you.

1:17:58.325 --> 1:18:01.589
I'll take it.
I got it.

1:18:01.677 --> 1:18:03.113
Okay.

1:18:11.077 --> 1:18:13.471
Hey, you're going to make it.

1:18:13.558 --> 1:18:15.429
You really think we can make it?

1:18:15.516 --> 1:18:18.258
Yes.
Come on.

1:18:32.620 --> 1:18:36.537
You're good.

1:18:36.624 --> 1:18:38.626
We're good.

1:18:50.551 --> 1:18:51.509
You okay?

1:18:51.596 --> 1:18:52.640
Yeah...

1:18:56.383 --> 1:18:58.211
-Whoa!
-Jill!

1:19:00.170 --> 1:19:01.867
You okay?

1:19:01.954 --> 1:19:02.955
Jill?

1:19:04.652 --> 1:19:06.045
Yeah, it's just a twist.

1:19:12.312 --> 1:19:13.574
Ah...

1:19:15.228 --> 1:19:16.708
Can you make it?

1:19:19.232 --> 1:19:20.625
If you can make it,
I can make it.

1:19:22.061 --> 1:19:23.410
Let's do it.

1:19:28.676 --> 1:19:29.808
Okay.

1:19:31.549 --> 1:19:33.159
Okay, I'm good.

1:19:53.789 --> 1:19:55.529
I'll go check it out.

1:19:57.009 --> 1:19:59.229
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:19:59.316 --> 1:20:00.317
Just got to rest.

1:20:58.505 --> 1:20:59.898
Jill?

1:21:01.030 --> 1:21:03.032
What do you see?

1:21:03.119 --> 1:21:05.948
It's clear.
Slippery, but it's clear.

1:21:06.035 --> 1:21:07.427
Okay.

1:21:07.514 --> 1:21:09.865
Toss me the bag so you
climb carefully.

1:21:13.172 --> 1:21:14.695
You got it.

1:21:19.048 --> 1:21:20.179
I'm going to toss you this.

1:21:30.798 --> 1:21:32.278
No, no, no, no, no!

1:21:50.122 --> 1:21:51.732
That was too close!

1:21:51.819 --> 1:21:53.560
Sorry.

1:22:19.935 --> 1:22:21.458
Jill.

1:23:35.053 --> 1:23:37.012
-Doctor?
-Hi.

1:23:37.099 --> 1:23:40.145
Okay, so this is just gonna
sting a little bit.

1:23:40.232 --> 1:23:41.842
Thank you.

1:23:41.929 --> 1:23:43.192
Ready?

1:23:48.849 --> 1:23:53.767
Okay, now just be sure

1:23:53.854 --> 1:23:55.552
to stay at
least six feet away

1:23:55.639 --> 1:23:57.554
from others for
the next week or so.

1:23:57.641 --> 1:24:00.948
This cure is not instant, okay?

1:24:01.036 --> 1:24:02.298
There you go.

1:24:02.385 --> 1:24:04.430
-Gracias.
-Gracias.

1:24:07.172 --> 1:24:09.827
Oscar, when is the next supply
replenishment coming in?

1:24:09.914 --> 1:24:11.742
We shall have more
within the hour.

1:24:11.829 --> 1:24:13.222
Okay, great.

1:24:24.494 --> 1:24:27.279
-Mike! Oh, my God!
-Jill!

1:24:27.366 --> 1:24:28.802
Jill!

1:24:28.889 --> 1:24:31.066
I can't believe you're here!

1:24:34.721 --> 1:24:37.594
-Jill?
-Sara!

1:24:40.901 --> 1:24:42.990
When I heard there was
a cure I hoped it was you,

1:24:43.078 --> 1:24:46.037
but I was beginning
to think it was impossible.

1:24:46.124 --> 1:24:47.908
Nothing's impossible.

1:24:47.995 --> 1:24:49.823
Not for us.

1:24:49.910 --> 1:24:53.436
Not for this family.

1:24:53.523 --> 1:24:55.307
Come on, let's get
you guys taken care of.

1:24:58.789 --> 1:25:00.834
As countries around the
world search for survivors

1:25:00.921 --> 1:25:02.923
from the destruction
caused by the ice walls,

1:25:03.010 --> 1:25:04.838
hope in the form of a vaccine

1:25:04.925 --> 1:25:07.014
will ensure the survival
of the human race.

1:25:07.102 --> 1:25:09.713
In other news, the government
of Ecuador has taken the lead

1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:11.541
in the Green Earth
Initiative to ensure

1:25:11.628 --> 1:25:13.760
that we do not make
the same mistakes again.
