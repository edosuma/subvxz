04:59.465 --> 05:01.911
Not that mummy, the
angel which flies -Where?

05:02.835 --> 05:05.645
They are the guarding

05:08.508 --> 05:10.419
You won't be able to see

Those angels

If it doesn't happen like that

07:32.718 --> 07:34.163
Then I should die, Gorilla

07:34.253 --> 07:37.200

Royal lady is taking rest over there

12:14.800 --> 12:17.474

12:17.803 --> 12:19.305
Brother in law is

12:19.472 --> 12:21.474
The doctor has advised
her to take rest

12:21.941 --> 12:23.318
It is the same every day

12:29.014 --> 12:32.393

babies, it was a normal delivery

12:32.518 --> 12:35.055
What is the reason for that? Like

12:39.925 --> 12:41.302
Before she was getting pregnant

12:41.393 --> 12:43.395
Mother wasn't she who did
all the jobs in this house?

13:39.952 --> 13:42.023
Daily motor is turned on
two or three times

13:42.188 --> 13:44.225
Is the light turned off in your
room, even after 12 O' clock?

13:44.390 --> 13:47.496
The household items for a month is
finished within a week by your wife

13:47.827 --> 13:50.068
If its to ruin like this, it
can't be allowed here

13:54.033 --> 13:55.944
So, all this drama was for that, no?

13:56.101 --> 13:59.844
When I remained without job for a
month you have started to account for

14:00.039 --> 14:04.078
Before that, didn't I hand over
my monthly salary to you?

14:04.243 --> 14:05.916
Then about this pension

14:06.011 --> 14:09.424
That is received because, my father
toiled at KSEB for nearly 22 years

14:09.615 --> 14:14.325
Mother, you are too cynical!
Will leave

14:14.854 --> 14:17.391
Myself and her, will leave from

On hearing it may sound strange

15:05.504 --> 15:10.920

16:16.175 --> 16:18.416
Slow motion, we are
taking it in slow motion

16:18.577 --> 16:24.152
The concept which is conceived
is, the Willi who jumps over red chilli

16:24.283 --> 16:25.353
Was it red chilli?
Yeah red

16:25.451 --> 16:30.298
In my mind, it was green chilli,
the Willi who comes through it

16:30.456 --> 16:33.062
Won't it be great?
Can be made green if necessary

16:34.026 --> 16:35.596
Sir tea
Almond juice!

16:37.363 --> 16:40.708
Same pinch! -That can be
changed according to Ravi's likes

Anyway you may go and change
the costume, we'll shoot

16:44.169 --> 16:45.477
Just one minute okay

16:45.771 --> 16:48.183

21:42.968 --> 21:43.844
No problem

21:45.437 --> 21:46.438
My mother!

21:55.480 --> 21:59.519
Look, sit there and
tell loud all should hear

22:02.654 --> 22:06.727
This bag, don't you want it?
Should I tell from beginning?

22:07.392 --> 22:08.462
Go on

22:10.996 --> 22:15.843
Come on tell
Brother can you give some water'?

22:17.102 --> 22:18.581
Here, its good water

22:19.037 --> 22:20.380
Go head drink

22:23.041 --> 22:26.079
Was it dry? Okay no problem

22:27.979 --> 22:30.550
Sir, the story takes place in Cochin

22:33.118 --> 22:34.893
A mighty don!

22:35.320 --> 22:37.630
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

22:37.756 --> 22:39.633
This Cochin is under him

22:41.093 --> 22:44.370
In this city where there
is looters and thieves

22:44.563 --> 22:47.134
Ayoung man is coming
who is a good person

22:48.166 --> 22:49.577
I'm the one

22:50.802 --> 22:55.717
But he is a small goon, he becomes
the trusted guy of this don

23:05.517 --> 23:08.088
At one stage this don
comes to know that

23:09.788 --> 23:11.028
This Willi..

23:12.758 --> 23:14.396
This Willi..

23:15.660 --> 23:17.606
He is a police commissioner

23:21.032 --> 23:23.672
Shashi Kumar IPS

23:31.843 --> 23:33.948
This don gets scattered

23:34.513 --> 23:36.083
This is 'Pokkiri' (Name of a movie)

23:36.481 --> 23:38.654
Yeah, its 'Pokkiri'
I've seen it twice

23:38.817 --> 23:40.421
Won't get scattered
Yeah, its true, its 'Pokkiri'

23:40.786 --> 23:44.791
All though we've taken a bit of
'Pokkiri' the making will be good

23:44.890 --> 23:46.836
Has got another camera man, no?
Yeah

23:46.992 --> 23:48.562
When the camera is
different, the movie will change

23:48.693 --> 23:49.831
Why isn't there a camera man?

23:50.028 --> 23:51.166
There is a different camera, no?

23:52.697 --> 23:53.835
Its going to be
good as commissioner

23:53.965 --> 23:55.171
If I play it, its going to be superb

23:55.534 --> 24:00.745
All this copying won't work
out, once we steal do it fully

24:00.906 --> 24:02.180
<i>Otherwise don't opt that 'pt:</i>

24:07.879 --> 24:10.587
I'll tell one story
What, a story?

24:18.790 --> 24:20.201
Like what you have said, a don

24:33.939 --> 24:35.543
A smuggler

24:35.874 --> 24:37.547
Like our 'Surya- in -Ayan.

24:37.909 --> 24:39.081
Like me

24:39.678 --> 24:41.021
Like Surya

24:45.050 --> 24:49.089
Along with daughtefs
birth, his wife is dead

24:49.888 --> 24:51.231
What a pity

24:52.190 --> 24:56.468
Like that he continues
to live being alone in life

24:58.530 --> 25:00.567
At present he has got a love affair

25:00.966 --> 25:05.966
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

25:19.918 --> 25:23.161
But the love isn't
working out properly

25:29.794 --> 25:31.034
Ancy, just stop

25:34.733 --> 25:35.803
What do you want?

25:36.001 --> 25:37.639
Started for a long time

25:40.772 --> 25:45.050
I love Ancy, wish to marry

25:45.944 --> 25:49.118
Again if you stand before me
like this you will get the beating

25:56.288 --> 25:57.289
And then?

25:58.323 --> 26:00.303
That is not because of don

26:01.026 --> 26:05.338
Then?
His fore father's weren't good

26:07.899 --> 26:10.038
That is true, were very bad

26:10.835 --> 26:13.213
Which means, don's father is a thief

26:15.640 --> 26:17.881
Grand father was yet
another well known thief

26:19.311 --> 26:24.124
When saying short,born to thieves
family, a hard core thief's love

26:24.716 --> 26:27.629
Will poke in the eyes
Why laughing you jerks?

26:35.193 --> 26:40.199
Can you work out on this love?
Any way trapped

26:42.767 --> 26:45.008
In a cinematic manner,
a song is the beauty of it

<i>MBRHDRG</i>

26:52.944 --> 26:56.153

Hey Dosco, haven't you
told them all the matters?

29:54.926 --> 29:56.496
Yeah
There will not be any agreement

29:56.594 --> 29:58.369
Should vacate at any
time when you are told

29:59.063 --> 30:01.771
Only one meter for both
houses, come and take a look

We use only two bulbs one is
at the hall and other is at the toilet

30:07.372 --> 30:10.080
On saying that, there are two toilets

30:10.308 --> 30:12.481
We'll pay only rupees
hundred as current bill

30:12.811 --> 30:14.848

Look, on opening this
window its good breeze

30:19.117 --> 30:21.893
AIC is not at all required but
should be careful while opening it

30:22.020 --> 30:24.864
By the way don't throw
the waste at the cannal

30:25.023 --> 30:26.559
That should be placed
in-front of that gate

will come and collect it

is not allowed in my house

hey Vasco is he really married?

30:38.069 --> 30:39.241
Or is it some kind of bogus activity?

30:39.370 --> 30:40.815
No, there isn't any bogus activity

No, buddy that is not
required, this one is okay

Our church's construction
which is stopped

37:41.425 --> 37:42.665

the church construction work

are having such a thought?

37:55.039 --> 37:55.983
That is..

37:57.875 --> 38:01.448
To tell the truth, I had a
dream on our saint

38:05.916 --> 38:08.692
Darvin, from now on you should
travel in the paths of virtue

38:08.753 --> 38:09.993

Father, I'm not the
previous Darvin now

As an expiation for my sins

I want to construct our
sain't's church with my money

38:20.498 --> 38:23.069
That is my offering to Saint

38:36.447 --> 38:40.293
By the way father is it true that
Darvin has received the vision?

38:40.751 --> 38:41.957
Who knows

38:42.787 --> 38:45.063
By the way has
father received any vision?

38:45.589 --> 38:47.398
What do you want to know now?

38:47.591 --> 38:51.471
Whether have I received the
vision or has Darvin received vision?

38:52.396 --> 38:54.933
Hey fool, don't I
get the vision of saint?

Will she wear this colour?

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:39.784
That is in the other side section

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.546
This ladies nighty and all
She won't wear the nighty

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:47.988
Bhai,should treat okay

As this bike was not sold
What for man?

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:52.189
Didn't you know? There was a
theft in our Thakudu's house

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:55.535
Then? - From the safety pin to
sleeping cots were stolen

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.500
As the bike was over
here, they didn't take it

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.739
When was it?
Two days back

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.201
The bike is okay

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.638
How much is it?
Bhai give something

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:12.479

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:59.892
Sir, I've reached below,

From where?

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:16.704
Not only the bike sir

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:19.841
Is the mobile also lost?
Good morning sir

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:25.745
Man, what is the new case?
Someone has taken his bike

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:30.384
Fellow, is it theft?
Hey fellow is it theft?

01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:35.418
Yes
Which is the vehicle?

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:40.362
KB 100 - Fellow who is
going to steal that old bike?

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:44.070
Sir, came here to know who
has taken that vehicle?

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:46.364
On coming to station
and using foul language?

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:50.137
So on wearing uniform, coming
here sir can use foul words, isn't it?

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:58.880
Fellow again theft
will happen in your house

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:02.279
You have to come here
again with the complaint

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:05.384
So because of that brother
you sit here for some time

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:07.791
He and his KB 100

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:12.397
Free him when he becomes silent

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:41.218
By the way who is this one?

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:50.758
Hello

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:54.795
Boy Anil, you aren't even calling me

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:59.239
Son, where is Amala?
Is she fine?

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:04.900
Son will you come
here along with her?

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:11.183
Son, you pardon mother, again
mother won't create any problems

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:15.587
Son, will you come?

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.350
I'll call mother -Mother can't
bear being alone here

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:22.891
Mother, I'll call to there

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:29.619
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:46.551
Something should be done,
there is no other way that's why

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:49.614
<i>An“ where is your native?
Kotkarakara</i>

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:53.051
There is one uncle for
Darwin pickpocketer Peter

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:56.125
This is his way of operation the
opponents are harassed through theft

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:57.988
Forefather's did it directly

01:20:58.186 --> 01:20:59.927
Darwin sends men and does that

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:04.126
In a way its a blessing since he
takes revenge like this at-least is alive

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:09.307
Anil you do one thing, return
back to native that is good

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:12.437
SI Jackson is the relative of Darwin

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:17.007
I can't do anything on
this matter, Ashir

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.618
From here you are not going to anywhere
don't think anything like that

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:31.563
Its not SI Jackson who is
here aren't there other cops here?

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:34.126
Man, we'll meet the commissioner
and directly give the complaint

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:37.132
Hey fellow, are you mad? By
creating an ill feeling to that Darwin

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:39.532
Do you think we can live
here peacefully along with family?

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:44.110
Look man if it had happened to you,
will you say the same at that time?

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:47.040
They we'll jointly suffer that's good

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.877
Ashir, stop the vehicle

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.916
What is it man?
Stop the vehicle

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:15.472
From here on, if any problems
arise they are only my problems

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:19.178
None of you should interfere on that
He said something without thinking

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:24.449
Just because of helping
me, you all have suffered a lot

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:28.021
I won't allow that again
Come and get inside the car

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:31.486
Its not possible leave me..
Leave me on my own path

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.553
None of you should
come behind me

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:38.188
On coming perhaps
I might do something

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:44.465
Has he ever created any issues?
I've told only the truth

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.209
Has happened what
was said by SI Jackson

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:54.378
Once again theft took
place in Anil's house

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:57.309
Bit of fear which was
hidden somewhere inside

01:22:57.439 --> 01:23:01.387
On that day he lost it forever
as that theft took place

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:04.747
Before him there was only
one way that appeared

(Prayers to Lord Ayyappa)

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:53.239
Theft will again take place, lad
you can't directly confront Darwin

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:56.740
<i>Shucks'. That is why came
'new ta Ayyappan Anna“</i>

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:59.339
Yeah, yeah that's true

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:04.608
Why don't we chop off his head?
His head!

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.144
That is not required
Then will cut both legs!

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:12.087
That is also not required
Then what is your intention?

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:22.401
His sleep should be lost,
I want to harass him mentally

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:28.472
The sleep should be
lost and harass mentally -Yes

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:30.037
That's not possible

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:33.175
Ayyappa Anna, can
do that if intended

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:38.116
It can be done but.
I'll do whatever it is

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:39.649
Hey boy, that's not the issue

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:42.685
How much will you give?
How can he give?

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:44.346
What he had with him
was taken by that guy, no?

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:50.152
That's true
Mental harassment can be done

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:53.392
sleep can be denied but
you should leave some where

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:56.834
By the way lad, where ever
you go you should live, no?

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.399
To live money is required, no?

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:04.405
I'll get you ten lakhs from Darwin

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:09.375
Out of it five..No, would you
mind giving me one Iakh from it?

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:13.484
No, but..Rupees ten Iakhs and all

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:15.845
How to get it from Darwin?

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.451
That is Ayyappan special

01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:24.091
Kidnapping
Danlvin's daughter Stefi

01:25:24.919 --> 01:25:27.832
We are going to kidnap her cooly

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:31.736
After that we'll call Darwin
and ask ten lakh rupees

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:36.869
When Danivin's child is kidnapped
definitely his peace of mind will be lost

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:40.211
Then he can't sleep also
like that we'll get our money

01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:41.505
Is it okay?

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.376
Won't hurt that child, no?

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:03.597
Hello Darman over
Kids are descending one by one, over

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.168
All the kids have got down,
Darwin's child isn't there, over

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:12.337
You just enquire over there, over

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:15.637
Can wait
Over here?

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:18.811
Should have sense,
should have sensibility

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.913
Should have sensitivity

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:25.952
What is it man?
Sister, is Darwin's child coming in this?

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.920
Which Darwin?
Is it Gorilla Darwin?

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:32.596
For what?
Just to see -Then there she comes

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:33.729
Yeah!

01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:38.803

Look he is giving kiss to child

01:26:50.238 --> 01:26:51.945
Why don't we push off?

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:54.215
My God!

01:26:57.712 --> 01:27:00.283
Has Darwin seen us?
No

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:01.653
Then he has escaped

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:05.630
Gone?

No
Re-incarnation of Ravanan

True, while going to Tanjore-

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:29.647
- and on checking the horoscope
only came to know that

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:32.791
Like Ravanan Ayyappettan
has gotten headed brain

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:36.625

move will be very sharp

as easy as plucking a flower

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:18.897
You are lucky to get us

01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:28.611

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:33.681

be done later, come fast

Anil, do you don't say like that

01:29:05.807 --> 01:29:10.654
Karnan, Nepolian, Bhagat
Singh three of them are my heroes

01:29:13.114 --> 01:29:15.720
All three of them have not failed
Come on stop it man

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.554
Has started for a long time

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:25.534
Anil, you should trust me

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:30.441
Like what is seen in movies
this kidnapping is not that easy

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:33.504
Look here, we will nab for sure

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:39.976
Look!
Yes boss - Stop the vehicle!

daughter must be kidnapped?

That is a very ripened one, no?
Yes Anil will nab him

When younger brother is
taken elder brother will be hurt

Even otherwise nabbing small kids
that is the task of cheap kidnappers

My goodness buddy we
have together acted in an ad

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:42.207
Due to this loss of memory
I can't recollect anything

Was it an ad on under garments?
Yeah

There is a role in

Did you see?

Come
Get down

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.100
Sit at the back

Does hero's sit in the front?

Not yet hero is it?

Its okay

01:31:25.713 --> 01:31:27.590
How long is
it to Ligo chettan's house?

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:29.523
Only five minutes
Only five minutes is it?

01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:31.887
Where is it?

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:37.536
Do you want?
Its good one

01:31:37.758 --> 01:31:39.465
No
I said no!

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.262
Buddy, this is Harish bhai

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:44.700
This is Ayyappa Annan, Ayyappa
Annan is casting director

01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:47.742
Won't say on seeing
What is this? Is it a earth quake?

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:50.479
Why so tensed? Are you
acting for first time?

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.651
Buddy, he is a fight master

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:57.613
Is he a master? Sorry
master, I'm Willi, master

01:31:57.979 --> 01:32:00.516
Anil Anto -What?
Anil Anto

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:03.853
Are you a Malayali? -Yeah
Are there Malayali masters?

01:32:04.285 --> 01:32:05.628
This movie is going to be great

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:11.759
Master I've been doing this fight
for so long, can you help me?

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:16.675
Can you try master?
Master you can do it

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:19.776
Why over here?
Did Ligo chettan (brother) come?

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:22.813
Ligo chettan will come
This is our main location

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:25.814
Myself and master will give a
scene to act, if you act that well

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:27.247
Willi is the hero

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:32.824
Come, tell me the way
Come, shall tell the way

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:40.955
Look a small room, bath room
looks like robbers den, very good

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:43.961
At present there is no robbery,
only den is there - Is it so?

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:47.229
What is this? Bottles and all
Did you like it? -Liked it

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:49.005
Master, what should I do?

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:54.906
You are..You are kidnapped
Is it?

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:57.647
Great, that is cool!

01:32:57.838 --> 01:32:59.681
You should call your
brother and tell this

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.013
What we need is the expression
on Willi's face during that time

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:04.123
Is it so?
How to do that?

01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:07.350
Where to start?
Come will do it here, no?

01:33:08.816 --> 01:33:09.817
Master the mouth should
be covered, no?

01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:12.225
Not that, while covering the
mouth can the talking take place?

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:14.629
Yeah, that's correct master
then I'll act as if my hands are tied

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:17.964
Master take this othenlvise there
won't be naturality for acting

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:20.570
How does it work?
Like this

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:23.201
The last dialled number
is Echayan (Elder brother)

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:24.968
What?
What is this man?

01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:27.171
Just tie him and after
that call Darwin

01:33:27.368 --> 01:33:30.645
Should have the idea, now look
how decently he is sitting with us

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:33.345
Simply has come with small
kid's bites and scratches

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:35.754
Its ringing

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:47.798
Echaya,few men has kidnapped
me, looks like they will kill me

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:50.126
Echaya, somehow save me
Where are you?

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:53.602
I don't know Echaya, they
have tied my eyes and hands

01:33:53.995 --> 01:33:56.202
Shucks! What to do with this fool?

01:33:58.232 --> 01:33:59.609
Has cut the call

01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:03.043
Is it okay?
Shall I do more better?

01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:04.706
No need this is fine
Is it enough?

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:07.216
This is rocking
Great, super

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:10.016
What is the next one?
Give

01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:12.921
Now Anil master will
call Willi's brother

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:13.887
Is it?

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:15.688
Then the expressions seen
on Willi's face at that time

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:18.223
There are many

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:21.225
Master is really tensed,
is it for first time?

01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:26.260
Hello
Reaction is required is it?

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:30.835
<i>I'm An“, An“ Ante</i>

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:38.707
Your brother Willi
I've kidnapped Willi

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:42.913
Yeah, let it come like that

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:51.222
Within one hour if you don't
pay me five..Ten Iakhs of rupees

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:55.432
I'll kill Willi
Don't kill

01:34:56.223 --> 01:34:57.725
He's doing very well

01:34:58.192 --> 01:35:03.192
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:11.841
The call was cut

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.953
Call once again
Call again -Let him act

01:35:16.043 --> 01:35:18.148
No problem call, Echayan will pick

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:21.858
Press on that speaker button
put it on speaker phone

01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:35.231
Darwin you brother is.. -Get lost
fellow..I'll give one and a half hourto you

01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:41.707
You kill him and if there is
anyone left to kill, kill them

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:45.315
And you clear off from Cochin
or else you will be finished

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:54.953
Gone out of hand
Ayyappa, has told the real name

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:57.320
Should have told some
Babu or something

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:02.827
Don't worry Echayan is
like that, don't get tensed

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:05.833
You...!
What is it brother?

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:13.338
Master, what I'm doing isn't it good?
Son, you may leave

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:17.914
Son? Has master called son?
Intended son in a different way

01:36:24.845 --> 01:36:26.552
What happened master?
What I did, isn't it correct?

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:28.526
Once again I'll do it in a better way

01:36:28.849 --> 01:36:30.920
Master you don't get tensed
as Echayan has said like this

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:34.862
More over between myself and
Echayan we are not in good terms

01:36:35.055 --> 01:36:38.127
We both have two different
fathers, no two mothers

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:40.266
No its two fathers only

01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:46.100
Master I'll do it once again
Son, please go

01:36:46.567 --> 01:36:50.242
Master I'll grow the beard, put on
weight, will reduce the height

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:52.543
I've got variety photos
with me, I'll show you

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.548
Master will like me well

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:57.085
See, in police dress how is it?

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:59.281
Look at this one
Did you see master'?

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:00.789
My goodness not this
one this one is..

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:02.189
Look at this one, its a good one

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:05.526
Not that one
Show the photo before this

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:07.197
No need of that
one, that's with underwear

01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:08.527
Before this one
Which one?

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:12.399
That's a personal photo, please

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:14.402
If Echayan knows this
it'll be a problem -This one is..

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:18.406
Isn't this golden statue of
saint at St. Antony's church?

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:19.504
Is it so?

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:26.215
Ayyappa Anna!
Yeah what is it?

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:28.148
Which is this place?

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:30.044
This is..

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:37.390
Chicken farm"
Darwin is also there

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:38.919
Its chicken farm of Darwin

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:40.598
Saint at the chicken farm?

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.534
Shall I go?

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:51.269
Tell the truth or else I'll kill you pig

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:54.108
While the church
renovation was going on

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:57.282
Echayan and gang changed
the original saint

01:37:57.471 --> 01:37:59.041
A duplicate saint was set

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.983
Please don't say this to Echayan
Cut, cut!

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:37.515
Cut, cut
Enough,enough

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:39.956
Brother, cut

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:44.027
What is this?

01:38:51.692 --> 01:38:53.000
Buddy did you get scared?

01:38:53.227 --> 01:38:54.570
That's all master's acting, no?

01:38:54.728 --> 01:38:57.174
Was it acting?
Why not? - I thought it was real

01:38:57.298 --> 01:38:58.174
That is what is called acting

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:00.212
What acting, look bruise on neck

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:01.669
Never mind

01:39:01.902 --> 01:39:06.902
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:18.488
All this was told earlier
and now why like this?

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:20.666
How many times did I say
this guy and this mother'?

01:39:20.754 --> 01:39:22.961
Look the way he sits
as if he is after an eye operation

01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:24.559
Is he born to present me with blows?

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:27.370
In my goon life I've
never seen such illiterates

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:31.599
Achaya, what should I
do now? Come on you tell

01:39:31.966 --> 01:39:33.536
All this was told initially
and fixed wasn't it?

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:35.542
Let m e say that

01:39:44.278 --> 01:39:46.155
I'll give the saint

01:39:47.781 --> 01:39:49.522
Yeah Achaya
Where are you?

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:50.991
I'm here

01:39:51.218 --> 01:39:53.721
Did you go any where?
No Achaya, should I go some where?

01:39:54.021 --> 01:39:55.227
You go and check
whether saint is over there

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:57.265
What Achaya?
Go and check it fellow

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:20.758
Achya, the saint is not
found when did you take it?

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:24.162
I'll say, your father's.

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:29.392
You idiot you go and
commit suicide or you are dead

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:37.767
Your mothefs husband
is dead, that's it

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.806
Happened is happened
Kick this fellow out

01:40:46.106 --> 01:40:47.449
Or you'll get kicks from me
I've told hundred times

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:49.452
He is an angry man

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.146
He will punch on your heart

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:54.182
My African

01:40:54.381 --> 01:40:56.418
You put money, Achayan
will show the saint

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.731
Why did he go to light
candles for duplicate saint?

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:48.175
This renovation of the church was
to snatch the saint isn't it Willi?

01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:52.807
Darwin, what you did was something
unthinkable to temple thieves

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:58.280
Ayyappa, protect the saint

01:42:14.628 --> 01:42:17.802
Hey saint, I'm going to play a game

01:42:26.406 --> 01:42:27.544
Hold him!

01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:31.780
You pig, some outsiders can they
play boss in Cochin?

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:34.556
Here take him Achaya!

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:40.621
Coming here and doing show off?

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:50.909
Achayoo, this place is yours

01:42:51.865 --> 01:42:56.439
Surrounded by your men, I've
come here all alone haven't I?

01:42:57.204 --> 01:43:01.448
In that case we should
fight each other alone

01:43:03.277 --> 01:43:07.384
if you are ready for that, tell
these people to leave me, you fellow!

01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:08.619
You Darwin!

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:51.765
Achaya!

01:44:21.054 --> 01:44:23.591
If it were to deal physically
call ten more people -

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:25.970
-and Achayan can finish me here

01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:31.331
Then Achayan will
never get the saint back

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:42.649
I've some demands if that is settled
on talking, will return the golden saint

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:45.654
We can part happily

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:50.419
For that you should
go from here alive

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:59.294
Achayoo, will go as long as saint is
with me, you can't do anything on me

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:05.639
If the believers in this native come to
know inside the St. Antony church

01:45:05.832 --> 01:45:08.711
Instead of original what is
present is painted statue...!

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:12.975
That's the end of Gorilla Darwin!

01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:28.528
Hey boy, can I get some water?

Come on Achaya sit

01:46:05.125 --> 01:46:11.906
Achayan's style of making
me busted, I liked it

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:17.104
So, when I return
that play to Achayan

01:46:17.437 --> 01:46:19.849
Wouldn't it be in same manner?

01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:31.959
Achaya, I want it back all that is lost

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:42.372
My baby died that sorrow
myself and my wife will bear

01:46:44.197 --> 01:46:47.474
But all the things which Achayan
took from my house

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:51.474
I must get it back

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:56.653
Purchase and give what his things
are -Yeah will purchase and give

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:06.388
The very same things which
Achayan took from my home!

01:47:08.488 --> 01:47:09.660
I want it back

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:28.683
Those things posses lot
of happiness and sorrows

01:47:29.009 --> 01:47:30.989
It has got the love of my friends

01:47:31.945 --> 01:47:34.084
Will it be present in the new one?

01:47:35.048 --> 01:47:39.428
Again if at all either
Achayan's or your men's-

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:44.024
-shadow comes near
my wife or my pals

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:47.533
The saint will appear!

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:53.938
After making the arrangements for
that only I've come here today

01:48:08.715 --> 01:48:09.887

<i>MBRHDRG</i>

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.574
Husband so are you a believer?

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:14.686
Not because I'm a believer, some
jerks will come to capture the scene

01:50:14.841 --> 01:50:17.913
This is done to cover that one, if
anything is seen, everything is lost

01:50:21.147 --> 01:50:22.125
You may sit child

01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:29.196
Why are you with a sad face?
How do you know all that?

01:50:29.823 --> 01:50:32.997
Which one?
Earlier haven't you called jerks?

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:35.001
Husband have you gone like that?

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:38.199
Shucks! I won't go for
such cheap things

01:50:38.732 --> 01:50:41.042
Child, isn't all that bad?

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:42.412
Isn't it?

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:47.877
Husband you may drink the milk
Not used to such items at this time

01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:48.746
What?

01:50:49.042 --> 01:50:51.784
Drinking milk during

01:50:58.051 --> 01:50:59.724

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:04.629
May be I'll even bite you

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:11.103
Child do you know? This first night
of ours we should change this-

01:51:11.264 --> 01:51:13.266
to an unforgettable first night

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:19.308
We both without sleeping
hugging each other on this cot

01:51:19.439 --> 01:51:22.784
Will look at the eyes
each other till dawn

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:25.183
Why simply sitting like this?

01:51:33.386 --> 01:51:35.263
You naughty!

01:51:37.157 --> 01:51:42.470
Usually rain ruins, now it is..
Achaya there is a problem

01:51:42.796 --> 01:51:45.936
What is it? -Its the wedding of that
person from whom we've to take cot

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:47.406
First night, the door is closed

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:51.110
What to do now?
Call and take the cot

01:51:51.304 --> 01:51:53.807
Why simply disturbing?
Long ago in our Maha Bharatha

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:56.283
As the Beema was disturbed
by dog,was in a vex situation!

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:58.946
Has got a tension on that
When did you read Maha Bharatha?

01:51:59.179 --> 01:52:00.385
You knock and take the
cot and come, man

01:52:00.714 --> 01:52:03.160
Earlier sleazy magazines
were hidden in Maha Bharatha

01:52:03.316 --> 01:52:06.297
Because of that -Why don't we
take the cot tomorrow morning?

01:52:06.453 --> 01:52:09.332
That's a good idea if its tomorrow
morning its free will come and take it

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:12.129
Its bad when taken now
Okay will take tomorrow

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:18.407
Achayoo, its been several days
since I've slept peacefully

01:52:19.065 --> 01:52:22.911
So, today night I must sleep
on my own cot, that's a wish

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:29.214
The cot, Achayan you yourself
must take the cot tonight for me

01:52:41.955 --> 01:52:43.491
Child you may sing

It must be that damn
old lady today I'll show her!

01:52:49.195 --> 01:52:50.401
What hell...?

01:52:54.167 --> 01:52:55.339
What is it Achaya?

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:59.507

That iron cot which you have
purchased from our Majeed

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:15.362
I want it now -Are you talking
about the cot in my bridal room?

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:21.270
You go and take that one

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:25.542
Achaya, don't say like that - Go
Don't put me in a fix

01:53:25.899 --> 01:53:29.244
After 40 years has gained this
first night after lot of waiting

01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:32.383
Achayan, shouldn't make
it into my last night

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:34.917
Anyway I'll take the cot
You go and take it, go

01:53:35.942 --> 01:53:40.391
Not that Achaya, will you take
the cot any way? <i>-I'll</i> take it

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:44.426
So, you'll take it, no? Then
can you give one hour time?

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:46.392
After that Achayan
you can take the cot

01:53:48.555 --> 01:53:50.125
Give one hour, please Achaya

01:53:50.323 --> 01:53:52.997

Look, entire things taken by
Achayan from my house

Till it reaches back to my house
should tolerate me somehow

01:55:28.454 --> 01:55:33.335
Its the responsibility ofAchayan to
look after me very well during that period

01:55:35.194 --> 01:55:37.697
Or else the task will be
given by the saint

01:55:43.536 --> 01:55:46.540
Come on tell Achaya, how was it?

His grand mother's fridge!

02:04:02.968 --> 02:04:07.474
If you are scared I'll go and tell,
move back -No, he won't listen

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:09.483
Leave that
Why are you scared of him?

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:10.916
Does he have any
video clip of yours?

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:12.817
Did you get trapped on something?

02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:15.014
What are you saying? Its not all that

02:04:15.514 --> 02:04:20.623

Hello, Sukur, no I'm bit busy

Look, it seems our Darwin

02:04:31.096 --> 02:04:33.770
It seems like that from the
way he acts -What's he saying?

02:04:33.966 --> 02:04:36.105
Okay then fine

02:04:40.272 --> 02:04:43.583

That is..
Around Rs. 3000

For me..
Achaya, my KB 100 will do!

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:16.762
Is he Solomen?

02:08:19.725 --> 02:08:24.196
That's good Solomen chettan

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:28.137
Achayan, you may call me
once you collect the bike

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:52.826
Sir, you might have understood
the issue vaguely

02:08:53.492 --> 02:08:56.302
It was sifs brother
who took my vehicle

02:08:56.495 --> 02:08:59.305
Right now it is with that guy

02:08:59.898 --> 02:09:02.902
So, let the boss of police
go and collect it -What, me?

02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:05.913
Go and collect the
vehicle you fellow

do you remember saying -

02:09:38.804 --> 02:09:40.545
- when I come to your
area you'll cut my head

02:09:42.007 --> 02:09:45.545
Now you have come to my area,
how is it possible if I don't take your leg?

Saint is bathed and is
lying at Achayan's ice plant

Tell someone from your

02:18:03.407 --> 02:18:05.888
- DanNin's ice factory's water tank

02:18:06.745 --> 02:18:08.315
Was it over there?

02:18:17.388 --> 02:18:18.026
Yeah Achaya!

And see whether
something is lying inside

Achaya..
Our saint is here!

02:18:34.939 --> 02:18:36.781
Achaya, when did you put this here?

- without much needs and wishes

02:19:17.949 --> 02:19:20.589
Came with my wife
to live a true Christian

02:19:21.719 --> 02:19:26.635
As there was no other way
when there was nothing else to lose

02:19:27.125 --> 02:19:29.605
With the guts which Lord
gave decided to play a game

02:19:29.794 --> 02:19:31.330
Which was this game

02:19:32.364 --> 02:19:36.938
But now, there is a feeling there are
certain things that may be lost

02:19:38.803 --> 02:19:42.580
Because of that
I'm not joining Achayoo

02:19:43.674 --> 02:19:45.085
Leave me

What happened?

Said after receiving the saint will be
put to sleep now what happened?

Fellow, intended to put on
sleep but on later thinking

02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:14.842
Felt there is nothing
wrong in what he did

02:20:17.208 --> 02:20:19.814
Today if he hadn't
blocked Solomen's sword

02:20:20.011 --> 02:20:21.649
But head would be lying down

02:20:21.913 --> 02:20:24.018

dead, do you know that?

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:26.161
Being dead it was better than this

if it had happened to my daughter Stefi

02:20:30.488 --> 02:20:31.626
Will I remain idle?

02:20:31.823 --> 02:20:34.167

that is what he did

02:20:36.461 --> 02:20:38.998

Achayan, what are you saying?

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:40.438
Has he gone mad?

Hey fellow, my thoughts
aren't unstable

act is wrong or right

prayed by lighting candles

As a hero, is it?
Yeah a hero

02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:17.594
Sir actually I'm not like this

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:19.332
When seen directly I'm very different

02:28:19.457 --> 02:28:21.994
Did you see? When looking from
this side, there is a big change

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:23.628
When looking from back
won't recognise, did you see?

02:28:23.961 --> 02:28:26.908
Isn't it different? Sometimes
I won't even recognise myself

02:28:27.131 --> 02:28:30.340
if necessary I'll reduce the
height, will grow the beard

02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:33.641
Like sir, I'll put on
weight and become trim

02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:37.316
I'll be handsome like this
Sir you are also very handsome

02:28:37.475 --> 02:28:38.579
What's your name?

02:28:39.310 --> 02:28:42.985
Willi, that can be changed
for the movie if necessary

02:28:45.182 --> 02:28:48.322
If a give a scene to
Willi, can you act that?

02:28:51.222 --> 02:28:54.931
That is enough sir
I'll do it

02:28:55.426 --> 02:29:00.171
Sir, you wait and see I'll be the
hero for sure, sir will really like me
