09:15.772 --> 09:17.121
[laughs]

09:17.165 --> 09:19.602
CHLOE:
So, Daniel Moore, vegan chef.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.343
Curiously found with
raw meat in his mouth.

09:21.386 --> 09:24.433
Ah. So vegans can't enjoy
a healthy sex life? [laughs]

09:25.608 --> 09:27.001
Tough crowd.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.742
Turns out, he
owns a cattle ranch

09:28.785 --> 09:31.135
in Montana, and the
environmentalist who was found

09:31.179 --> 09:33.834
drowned in jet fuel, he
actually owned a private plane.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.836
So, someone's killing
charlatans. Ah.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.751
The worst kind of scum.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.230
Next to boy bands.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.145
All three victims
had trace amounts of

09:41.189 --> 09:42.799
the exact same poison
in their system.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.584
Same profile, same M.O.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.760
This is a serial killer.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.762
Yes. The Completely Justified
Killer of Phonies.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.633
If that's what you name him,
I want credit.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.418
The first scene was
found over a month ago.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.811
Mm-hmm.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.770
The environmentalist,
a week ago.

09:56.813 --> 10:00.600
And Poppy here was found
just a few days later.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.385
I think the killer is
becoming more obsessed.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.169
He's accelerating
his timeline.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.998
We have to catch this guy
before anyone else dies.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.347
Why does Lucifer work with you?

10:12.220 --> 10:14.004
CHLOE:
I told you, it's an...

10:14.048 --> 10:15.658
unconventional partnership,
and it just...

10:15.702 --> 10:16.790
That's not it.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.313
What's he get out of it?

10:18.356 --> 10:21.925
You'll have to ask him.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.858
Hi, hon.

10:41.902 --> 10:45.035
I know you've been avoiding me.

10:45.079 --> 10:48.212
I mean, things have
been... off lately.

10:48.256 --> 10:52.477
But I want to try
and turn things around.

10:52.521 --> 10:55.524
Can we talk?

10:55.567 --> 10:58.048
I miss you.

11:08.755 --> 11:09.973
Leave Lucifer Morningstar alone.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.063
Or you'll be too dead
to regret it.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.717
I'm onto something, aren't I?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.023
You can't scare me off.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.633
I've been threatened
by worse than you.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.855
I guarantee you haven't.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.726
[grunts]

11:38.132 --> 11:39.524
Oh, Mr. Getty.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.352
I need you to look up
this address.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.876
Something shady

11:42.919 --> 11:44.878
going on here.O-Okay, but there's, uh...

11:44.921 --> 11:46.749
Got to be a drug den,
human trafficking...

11:46.793 --> 11:48.751
Mr. Getty, your wife's
in your office.

11:48.795 --> 11:49.926
Really?

11:49.970 --> 11:51.449
My wife?

11:53.582 --> 11:54.888
How do I look?

11:54.931 --> 11:56.890
Uh...

11:56.933 --> 11:58.239
[sighs]

12:04.158 --> 12:06.900
Reese.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.684
We need to talk.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.993
Linda.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.778
You look... wow.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.086
We should go to dinner.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.957
Our favorite Italian
place is still open.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.611
I'll make reservations.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.832
Reese, why are people in your
office calling me your wife?

12:25.875 --> 12:28.530
Because you are my wife.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.488
No. We're separated.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.666
It's been two years.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.668
That's actually why I'm here.

12:36.712 --> 12:40.847
I have been more
than patient, but it's time.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.942
Sign the divorce papers, please.

12:48.985 --> 12:53.337
[sighs] Is this because
you're seeing someone else?

12:53.381 --> 12:56.776
No. No, this isn't because
I'm seeing someone, Reese.

12:56.819 --> 13:00.954
You can't keep leaving me
voicemails like that.

13:00.997 --> 13:04.740
Things are not "off lately,"
things are over.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.786
You need to move on.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.136
I can't move on.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.573
Don't you know
how much I love you?

13:11.616 --> 13:14.837
You never give up.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.797
It's one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.235
But that was a long time ago.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.150
Not that long ago.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.586
This is classic denial.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.240
It's a self-defense mechanism
that you...

13:26.283 --> 13:27.458
Don't analyze me, Linda.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.592
Sorry.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.466
We're over.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.427
Sign them.

13:41.995 --> 13:45.389
I'm working on something,
and I need a little more time.

13:45.433 --> 13:49.176
Why? Nothing you're working on
is gonna change anything.

13:49.219 --> 13:50.830
24 hours, that's all
I'm asking for.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.833
Okay, if I do...

13:53.876 --> 13:56.139
you'll finally sign the papers?

13:56.183 --> 13:57.880
I promise.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.898
Hey. Did you find anything
about that address yet?

14:15.942 --> 14:17.900
It's a known hot spot
for trading stolen goods.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.206
I knew he was up to something.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.860
Fencing? Smuggling? Or worse?

14:20.903 --> 14:21.991
Well, I can do some research
on the building.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.253
No, I need proof right now.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.082
Lucifer's duffel bag.

14:26.126 --> 14:28.432
I need to get it.

What the... ?

15:18.830 --> 15:21.442
Uh, uh, don't worry.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.052
I'm gonna get you out of here.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.575
[whimpers]

15:24.619 --> 15:26.490
LUCIFER:
Well, hello.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.101
What the hell are you
doing here?

15:28.144 --> 15:30.668
Well, it appears I've caught you
sneaking into my penthouse.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.932
So perhaps you should
answer that question.

15:32.975 --> 15:37.284
What story are you really
looking for, reporter?

15:37.327 --> 15:39.068
I'm gonna expose you
for the fraud you are.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.026
[laughs]

15:40.069 --> 15:41.114
And save this woman.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.463
Don't you try and stop me.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.247
I won't. She
might, though.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.510
Who is this guy, Lucifer?

15:46.554 --> 15:48.121
He doesn't seem very fun.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.471
REESE: You're not tied up
against your will?

15:50.514 --> 15:52.212
Um, no.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.474
I'm pretty into this.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.084
At least I was
until you got here.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.086
All right, that
doesn't matter.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.914
I know I'm onto something.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.917
Otherwise, why would you send
that crazy ninja woman after me?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.137
Crazy ninja wom-- oh, Maze?

16:04.180 --> 16:05.399
No, I didn't send her.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.749
She's just a tad
overprotective, that's all.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.012
Demon bartenders,
you know how they can be.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.840
What about that pile of cash
I saw you give that cop?

16:11.883 --> 16:13.320
Yes, to buy his duffel bag.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.061
Hard to find
quality leather

16:15.104 --> 16:16.323
with such tensile strength.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.193
The bag.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.152
That's right.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.067
This will prove everything.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.372
What is this?

16:27.377 --> 16:28.857
Are these sex toys?

16:28.900 --> 16:29.989
LUCIFER:
Edible sex toys,

16:30.032 --> 16:31.120
to be precise.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.774
Not exactly FDA approved,

16:32.817 --> 16:34.123
so I had to sneak
the delicious things

16:34.167 --> 16:35.646
through customs.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.648
How could I be so wrong?

16:39.824 --> 16:41.565
About so many things?

16:41.609 --> 16:43.132
[sighs]

16:43.176 --> 16:45.787
Look, I know why
you're upset.

16:45.830 --> 16:49.878
You thought you had a nice,
juicy scoop for your paper.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.750
And I don't blame you.
You're just doing your job.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.623
Unfortunately for you,
the only juicy thing here

16:55.666 --> 16:57.842
is the, uh...
Watermelon Willies.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.061
[chuckles]

16:59.105 --> 17:00.367
They're pretty good.
You should try one.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.021
Mm.I'm allergic to watermelon.

17:04.110 --> 17:07.200
Oh. Look, why don't
you come with me?

17:07.243 --> 17:08.810
The detective just called
with some sort of lead.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.073
I always find
catching a killer cheers me up.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.336
I mean, I was gonna
do Veronica first, but...

17:13.380 --> 17:14.859
you don't mind waiting,
do you, darling?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.165
Not at all.
Good.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.210
Come on.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.168
Excuse me.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.300
Do you mind?

17:23.868 --> 17:26.219
[muffled]:
Thank you.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.829
CHLOE: You were right
about the implants.

17:27.872 --> 17:31.180
They were pulled from the market
years ago due to rupturing.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.922
Oh, a moment of silence for all
those poor, mishandled breasts.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.924
CHLOE: They're illegal
to sell anywhere,

17:35.967 --> 17:37.708
but we pulled a
partial serial number

17:37.752 --> 17:39.188
that pointed to a
plastic surgeon's office

17:39.232 --> 17:40.929
in Beverly Hills.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.279
Wait, you, Scarface?

17:45.107 --> 17:48.197
You resent your clients,
don't you?

17:48.241 --> 17:49.764
I don't...You want them to suffer.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.854
I do.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.378
I want all of them to suffer.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.250
DAN:
Good work on the case.

17:57.293 --> 17:58.947
Realizing
that his scar

17:58.990 --> 18:01.863
made him resent other
people around him...

18:01.906 --> 18:03.430
that was good.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.301
Good detective work.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.086
CHLOE:
Reese, you okay?

18:07.129 --> 18:08.261

18:10.915 --> 18:12.221
REESE:
You were right.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.353
About?

18:15.485 --> 18:17.748
I wanted to write a piece that
showed that your partnership

18:17.792 --> 18:19.533
was a dangerous joke.

18:19.576 --> 18:22.753
That Lucifer was a fraud.

18:22.797 --> 18:25.060
But the truth is

18:25.104 --> 18:28.629
he's just frustratingly,
annoyingly...

18:28.672 --> 18:30.109
a charming guy.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.763
And you and him...

18:32.807 --> 18:36.506
[sighs] you two work
well together.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.378
There's no story here.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.075
I'm just gonna drop it.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.468
Is this some weird
journalist tactic

18:41.511 --> 18:43.078
to get me to
lower my guard?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.384
I wish.

18:44.427 --> 18:45.646
No, this is just me
getting out of the way,

18:45.689 --> 18:47.561
so you can do your job.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.128
Catch more killers.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.217
CHLOE: Unfortunately,
Barry's not our killer.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.480
He sold expired
medical goods

18:53.523 --> 18:55.917
from the office,
including some tainted Botox

18:55.960 --> 18:57.397
that poisoned a few people.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.528
And although

18:58.572 --> 19:00.182
he'll spend a very
long time in jail,

19:00.226 --> 19:01.270
he's not our guy.

19:01.314 --> 19:02.576
But if he sold supplies
to the killer,

19:02.619 --> 19:04.230
he should
know something.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.362
Well, he wouldn't give us
any information on the buyer.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.582
Probably scared, but
we'll get it out of him.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.454
Detective, the lieutenant's
asking for you.

19:11.498 --> 19:12.542
Okay.

19:12.586 --> 19:13.543
Uh, excuse me.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.328
Be right back.

19:15.371 --> 19:16.416
Thank you.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.031
LUCIFER:
Right.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.033
Now the detective's gone,
let's have a chat.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.730
Just the two
of us, shall we?

19:26.774 --> 19:28.819
BARRY: Look, I don't
know anything, okay?

19:28.863 --> 19:30.343
Yes, yes, you plead ignorance,

19:30.386 --> 19:32.475
and then we sweat you until
you finally give us a name.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.434
I'm sorry, I don't
have time for that.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.262
I've got a lovely lady
tied up back at my place.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.133
So I'd like to speed things up.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.412
Oh, oh!

19:58.327 --> 20:00.416
[panting]:
Oh.

20:15.823 --> 20:18.129
Oh...

20:22.221 --> 20:23.222
[gasps]

20:29.358 --> 20:31.578
You have to stop seeing
Lucifer Morningstar.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.362
How did you get that name?

20:33.406 --> 20:34.798
Uh...Okay, invading my privacy

20:34.842 --> 20:36.278
is one thing,

20:36.322 --> 20:37.453
but if you're stalking
my clients...

20:37.497 --> 20:38.541
I'm not stalking him.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.022
I was working on a story
with him.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.851
Oh, okay, so you just happened
to be working on a story

20:43.894 --> 20:45.026
with Lucifer.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.593
Okay, I know
this sounds crazy, it...

20:48.247 --> 20:49.204
He's the Devil.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.684
And I-I don't
mean in-in a,

20:50.727 --> 20:52.251
in a douchebag,
club-owning kind of way.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.253
I mean...

20:54.296 --> 20:55.645
he's the actual Devil.

20:55.689 --> 20:59.519
Yes, Lucifer is insistent
on this Devil persona.

20:59.562 --> 21:00.824
No, he isn't some patient.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.913
That's just a ploy that
he used to seduce you.

21:02.957 --> 21:06.395
Okay, so that's
what this is about.

21:06.439 --> 21:07.918
It is none of
your business

21:07.962 --> 21:09.485
who I sleep with.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.270
It is if it's Satan himself.

21:13.097 --> 21:16.275
I don't think you've understood
exactly what it is you're doing.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.451
Oh, I know exactly
what I'm doing.

21:19.626 --> 21:20.714
I'm enjoying myself with someone

21:20.757 --> 21:22.846
who doesn't make me
feel trapped.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.415
Lucifer is someone who is

21:26.459 --> 21:29.462
completely present
in the moment.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.073
Who gives me 100%
of his attention.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.423
And doesn't demand
anything from me.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.382
I guess if you want
to vilify him

21:36.425 --> 21:38.471
and call him the Devil...

21:38.514 --> 21:39.341
No, he is the Devil.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.867
But being with him

21:43.911 --> 21:48.263
is the most liberating
experience of my life.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.613
I see, he's-he's got you
under some sort of spell.

21:50.657 --> 21:54.661
You know, I've been
incredibly patient with you,

21:54.704 --> 21:58.317
because I still care about you,

21:58.360 --> 22:01.320
still worry about you.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.583
But I just can't take it
anymore.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.628
Okay, if I can come up with
proof that he is the Devil...

22:05.672 --> 22:07.674
Sign the papers!

22:16.335 --> 22:18.772
You've got a lot
you need to figure out, Reese.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.168
You're right.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.345

23:58.654 --> 24:00.613
It's Detective Decker.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.658
We could really
use your help.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.486
[sighs]

24:12.059 --> 24:13.713
How can I help you, Detective?

24:13.756 --> 24:15.715
Shower and a shave,
maybe. [chuckles]

24:15.758 --> 24:18.631
We're here about the serial
killer case from last year.

24:18.674 --> 24:19.980
I thought
the killer went dormant.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.590
He has,

24:21.634 --> 24:24.463
but we're still investigating
the case, and we've had a break.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.594
All the victims were

24:25.638 --> 24:27.030
local celebrities
who were featured

24:27.074 --> 24:28.641
in the Telegraph's
style section.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.033
You think he read the article?

24:30.077 --> 24:31.687
And we hope he commented
on them. We have a handle

24:31.731 --> 24:34.473
we think he used, TruthDog21.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.605
Well, the comments are public.
You can search them.We have.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.607
We didn't find anything,
but we want...

24:38.651 --> 24:40.609
But I was complaining
to the detective

24:40.653 --> 24:42.655
about some posts of mine
that have been removed

24:42.698 --> 24:45.266
from a web site for roosters
of award-winning size.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.789
[laughs]: You see, I was
posting pictures of my...

24:46.833 --> 24:48.008
CHLOE:
Okay.

24:48.051 --> 24:50.227
Okay.

24:50.271 --> 24:54.275
Does your paper archive
redacted comments?

24:54.318 --> 24:56.712
Uh, anything that's threatening
or violent.

24:56.756 --> 24:57.931
Or of award-winning size.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.628
REESE:
Uh, yeah, sure.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.674
Just give the information
to my assistant.

25:01.717 --> 25:04.372
He'll gather the info.
It might take a day or two.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.635
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.855
[both chuckle]

25:10.683 --> 25:12.511
You still haven't
destroyed him, have you?

25:12.554 --> 25:13.642
Excuse me?

25:13.686 --> 25:15.818
That sleazy piece of garbage

25:15.862 --> 25:17.646
who was sleeping
with your wife.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.300
No.

25:19.343 --> 25:20.693
I'm starting to think

25:20.736 --> 25:23.826
that he might be undestroyable.[chuckles]

25:23.870 --> 25:25.306
Well, perhaps you're not

25:25.349 --> 25:27.482
thinking outside the box
enough, Reesey.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.310
Don't be afraid to
take a big swing.

25:29.353 --> 25:30.616
It can be therapeutic.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.531
Oh, speaking of...

25:32.574 --> 25:36.317
[groans] I'm late
for my own therapy. Again.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.232
[chuckles]
She's gonna kill me.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.640
She said that was
a ridiculous idea...

25:54.683 --> 25:56.685
Linda.LUCIFER AND LINDA: Reese.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.861
What, you know him as well?

25:58.905 --> 26:01.560
My ex-husband, Reese...Linda.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.213
Stay back.Your ex-husband?

26:03.257 --> 26:05.520
So we're tunnel buddies.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.390
Hey.
[gun cocks]

26:13.659 --> 26:15.312
You realize what
you just did?

26:16.923 --> 26:19.316
You just ruined
a perfectly good Burberry.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.231
What kind of monster
are you?
REESE: See?

26:21.275 --> 26:23.756
He's the Devil! I told you.Y-You tried to kill him.

26:23.799 --> 26:26.019
Yeah, but I didn't.
He's invincible because
he's the Devil.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.977
See? There's your proof.Reese...

26:28.021 --> 26:29.283
You're lucky the detective
isn't here.

26:29.326 --> 26:30.980
You'd be cleaning my blood
out of the couch.

26:31.024 --> 26:32.634
Put the gun down, Reese.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.505
Right, I don't need it anymore.
Look, I...

26:36.246 --> 26:37.770
I know it's a lot to process,

26:37.813 --> 26:39.467
but you've got to believe me.

26:39.510 --> 26:40.816
Reese, I know he's the Devil.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.644
What?

26:42.688 --> 26:45.647
You... you... you do?

26:45.691 --> 26:47.780
Is this what you were trying to
tell me all those months ago?

26:47.823 --> 26:51.653
[gasps]
I saw his real face.

26:51.697 --> 26:52.654
If you see it,
then you'll know.

26:52.698 --> 26:53.655
I have seen it.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.004
And I know.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.832
I know

26:56.876 --> 26:58.573
how unsettling
it can be.
LUCIFER: Yes.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.748
And if you're
this unsettled by me,

26:59.792 --> 27:00.880
I'd hate to see
what you're gonna do

27:00.923 --> 27:02.229
to the scoundrel who's
been sleeping

27:02.272 --> 27:03.578
with your wife.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.362
LINDA:
I'm so sorry.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.669
I didn't realize
what you were going through.

27:08.975 --> 27:12.021
I didn't know the truth,

27:12.065 --> 27:13.936
and I didn't think
you did either.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.460
But you know now.

27:16.504 --> 27:17.853
And you're still seeing him?

27:17.897 --> 27:19.899
LUCIFER:
Only professionally, Reese,

27:19.942 --> 27:21.117
much to my disappointment.

27:21.161 --> 27:25.121
When I first learned
who he really was, it...

27:25.165 --> 27:27.689
[sighs] it-it turned my
world upside down.

27:28.908 --> 27:30.692
But he's not
what you think.

27:30.736 --> 27:31.824
He's the Devil!

27:31.867 --> 27:33.086
Oh, it's not like I've
hidden that fact.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.044
He's evil incarnate!No.

27:35.088 --> 27:38.352
No, he's a good man.

27:41.572 --> 27:42.791
He's my friend.

27:44.967 --> 27:48.492
All this time I've been...

27:48.536 --> 27:51.887
trying to prove to you
who he really is.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.323
And not only

27:53.367 --> 27:56.892
did you already know...

27:56.936 --> 27:58.111
you didn't care.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.808
Sit down, Reese, let's
talk this through.

27:59.852 --> 28:00.809
No, no.
Please, Reese.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.298
[knock on door]

28:11.341 --> 28:14.170
Your assistant left
your redacted comments research

28:14.214 --> 28:16.564
on my desk.

28:16.607 --> 28:20.916
Are you still working on
this nightclub owner thing?

28:20.960 --> 28:23.310
He's not just
a nightclub owner.

28:23.353 --> 28:26.139
So do you have a story for me,
something I can actually print,

28:26.182 --> 28:27.401
or just arts and crafts?

28:27.444 --> 28:28.576
This has to stop.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.012
Now.
I can't.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.233
I can't let this guy win.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.148
You have filed, barely,

28:35.191 --> 28:37.541
a dozen other stories
this year.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.369
And you have nothing to show
for all this work.

28:43.983 --> 28:46.594
This guy has won.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.683

as your friend.

28:50.206 --> 28:52.469

30:11.374 --> 30:14.073
I wanted to ask you
a few questions

30:14.116 --> 30:15.857
about some comments
that you posted

30:15.901 --> 30:18.207
on some stories we ran

I just want to
talk to you.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.230
You're here to
do a story on me?

30:41.274 --> 30:44.755
Well, my job is to
dig up the truth.

30:44.799 --> 30:47.280

who they really are.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.064

30:49.108 --> 30:50.979
I-I realized that

30:51.023 --> 30:53.068
you were just doing
the same thing.
Yeah.

I'm trying, I'm trying.I get it.
