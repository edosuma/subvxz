WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.209
I want Ł100 on their heads, Wally.
I want them in the ground!

00:04.360 --> 00:07.523
We get in first. You get her men
before they can get you.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.445
I need a favour. I need you
to find a place for him.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.409
You can have it anyway.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.086
I'm pregnant.
I can take care of you.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.244
I don't want anything
from you... ever again.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.482
'Crapetti', isn't it?
It's 'Calletti'.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.085
Keep your dago nose to yourself.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.005
You know what they call me?
They call me the... Oh!

00:26.840 --> 00:29.491
Jim, do it. Hurry up. Do it!

00:29.640 --> 00:31.768
Jesus. Cop this, you bastards.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.411
Barney!

00:34.560 --> 00:37.325
Barney was a fine young man.
He was a credit to you.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.086
Do you recognise this man?
Yeah.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.289
He shot Barney and he shot me.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.283
You piece of shit, Tomlinson!

00:45.440 --> 00:47.044
You're a dog, Tomlinson!

00:47.200 --> 00:49.487
He talked?
You're a dog!

01:34.480 --> 01:36.608
Scar on left cheek.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.764
Tattoo of a woman's breast
on left bicep.

01:45.040 --> 01:49.489
No ulcerations of evidence
of venereal disease on foreskin.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.404
By early 1930,

01:51.560 --> 01:53.881
the feud between Tilly Devine
and Kate Leigh

01:54.040 --> 01:56.247
was getting evermore personal

01:56.400 --> 01:58.368
and evermore deadly.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.524
Two of Kate's people
had been murdered,

02:02.680 --> 02:07.891
dozens on both sides had been slashed,
shot and brutalized.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.281
Come on, mate.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.971
And now Tilly's champion muscle
and Jim's champion acolyte,

02:33.120 --> 02:34.963
Frank 'The Little Gunman' Green,

02:35.120 --> 02:37.327
was facing the hangman's noose.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.364
Arggh!

02:49.800 --> 02:51.529
Ohh!

02:51.680 --> 02:53.489
Arggh!

03:03.040 --> 03:05.361
Who shot Barney Dalton?
Read the 'Truth...

03:05.520 --> 03:08.126
The Little Gunman
on trial for murder.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.009
Who shot Barney Dalton?
Read the 'Truth...

03:10.160 --> 03:11.889
The Little Gunman
on trial for murder.

03:12.040 --> 03:15.567
Jim, do it. Hurry up.
Do it! Jesus.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.802
Why didn't you shoot them?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.564
Despite his best efforts,

03:26.920 --> 03:30.288
while Wally Tomlinson
was preparing to walk a road

03:30.440 --> 03:33.046
rarely traveled in the underworld.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.762
Look lively, Wal! I've got
a fruit cake in the oven for ya.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.247
Oh, shit. it's burning.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.005
Ohh!

03:59.280 --> 04:01.760
Ah!

04:03.440 --> 04:05.169
Ohh...

04:05.320 --> 04:08.324
Huh, not my finest.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.970
You heard from her?

04:14.240 --> 04:16.004
She with your parents in Dubbo?

04:16.160 --> 04:17.649
Wouldn't know.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.247
Octopus has put the word out
round the wharves.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.129
Things as they are,
it shouldn't be too hard

04:24.280 --> 04:26.931
to find blokes who wanna make
a few extra bob working the doors.

04:27.080 --> 04:30.402
It seems like half of Sydney's
looking for a job at the moment.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.688
Yeah, I went round to your rooms
and I brought your clobber over.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.731
Wal, look, I know
you and Barney were mates

04:46.880 --> 04:49.008
and I know you wanna
do the best by him.

04:49.160 --> 04:52.721
But court's bad news whichever way
you look at it, all those beady eyes.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.167
You know that better than I do.

04:56.760 --> 05:00.242
They could understand
if you wanna pull the plug on this.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.004
I'm seeing it through, Kate.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.322
You think that Tilly's mob
are gonna let you testify?

05:05.480 --> 05:07.244
I don't know.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.449
Well, what about me?
What do I do then?

05:10.600 --> 05:14.969
Greg, Barney, Bruce. I need you, Wal.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.883
You need me?

05:20.840 --> 05:24.083
You know, if Green would've
aimed one inch to the left,

05:24.240 --> 05:26.208
I wouldn't have to worry
about any of this.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.087
Is he marked for death?
You bet he is.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.322
Where'd you get that?

05:37.480 --> 05:38.811
Borrowed it.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.371
Well, who are we gonna get, then?

05:40.520 --> 05:43.285
Nugget's staunch,
but he can't shoot for quids.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.330
Will Archer's making out
he's a hard man these days.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.882
Pity the best bloke
for the job's in the Bay.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.371
We can't fix him, Till.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.443
What's that?
Tomlinson.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.523
We can't touch him

05:55.680 --> 05:57.808
Can't so much as spit at him
on the street.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.850
But he squealed to the rozzers.
He fingered Frank.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.368
Every cop south of the bloody harborâs
watching us like hawks.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.842
Wally can't testify. Frank will hang!

06:08.000 --> 06:10.731
Jim! Are you hearing me?

06:10.880 --> 06:13.008
Frank could bloody hang
unless we do something.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.969
You think I don't know that,
you dumb bitch?

06:15.120 --> 06:17.168
Don't you go calling me names!

06:17.320 --> 06:19.049
You ain't even been
out to visit him yet.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.488
Jeez, you're a nag. I should
put a bet each way on you.

06:22.640 --> 06:27.168
Jim! This is Frank
we're talking about.

06:30.880 --> 06:34.282
15 shillings is a small price
for what I've got to offer.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.046
That'd keep me
in pork chops for a week.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.690
You can pork my chops, sir.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.763
Shifting for yourself now,
are you, Nellie?

06:40.920 --> 06:42.888
Why don't you come back
and work for me?

06:43.040 --> 06:45.281
Thank you for the offer,
but I'm doing fine.

06:45.440 --> 06:49.650
Is that so? I reckon you might
just be going off the boil.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.484
I told you if I catched you
sleeping on my doorstep again

06:54.640 --> 06:56.369
I'd tan your friggin" arses.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.010
Don't, you bastard!
We weren't doing no harm!

06:58.160 --> 07:03.121
Easy, Will. âBlessed are the meek
for they shall inherit the earth. â

07:03.280 --> 07:07.968
And blessed are them who know
what side their bread's buttered on.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.484
What can I do to help?

07:26.560 --> 07:28.722
No! No!

07:48.920 --> 07:51.002
A schooner, thanks.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.444
G'day, Wally.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.771
G- 'day, Will.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.002
I've got a message for you...

08:26.160 --> 08:28.128
from Tilly Devine.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.169
Tilly Devine?

08:31.520 --> 08:33.328
You kiss her bum
as soon as Green fired

08:33.480 --> 08:36.131
or did you wait till Barney
actually hit the ground?

08:36.280 --> 08:40.080
Strong words coming from a man with
'Kick me quick' pinned to his back.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.850
So quid.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.682
50 quid, and when the lawyer
asks about Frank Green,

08:47.840 --> 08:51.367
you find you can't recall
so much as seeing him in the street.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.250
You tell her I'll take her money

09:03.400 --> 09:05.971
when Barney Dalton buys me a fleshy.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.050
I'll be sure to pass on your answer.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.487
You do what you fucking like.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.331
Ł50?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.290
Now, I've fixed folk
for Jim and Tilly.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.124
I've done everything
they've asked of me.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.567
And now when I'm the one
who's facing the noose,

09:30.720 --> 09:33.451
all they can do in return
is 50 fucking quid?

09:36.480 --> 09:38.721
Bloody Tomlinson.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.924
He picked me straight up.
You know that?

09:44.080 --> 09:46.128
He never hesitated.

09:47.160 --> 09:52.371
Pity I didn't finish him as well
as Dalton when I was about it.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.527
To cheer you up, Frankie.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.489
Tell me what it's like...

10:04.040 --> 10:05.201
to fix a man.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.963
You're cracked.
Come on, love.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.001
Jesus, Nellie.
Tell me.

10:35.960 --> 10:40.522
I'll write you a postcard
I'll send you the news

10:49.000 --> 10:51.241
Your visitor's given you
blue balls, has she?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.846
At least I've got visitors and balls.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.049
You can have the stinking moll.
I hope she gives you the clap, mate.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.531
Ohh!

11:34.480 --> 11:39.088
I'm not sorry I met you
I'm not sorry it's over

11:51.720 --> 11:53.051
Now, Frank Green's trial

11:53.200 --> 11:55.362
is our chance to cut the feet
from under these women

11:55.520 --> 11:57.522
who think they have
the run of this city.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.127
This is the third death arising from
this feud between Devine and Leigh -

12:01.280 --> 12:04.648
Norman Bruhn, Greg Gaffney
and now Barney Dalton.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.610
Now, Kate's people are already
the walking wounded.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.569
If we can get Tilly's
chief gorilla convicted,

12:09.720 --> 12:11.404
we seriously damage her too.

12:11.560 --> 12:15.485
So shaved and sharp
and know your testimonies inside out.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.165
We are not- I repeat, not-

12:17.320 --> 12:19.209
gonna see a vicious little murderer
like Green acquitted

12:19.360 --> 12:23.001
by any want of preparation
from this station, right?

12:23.160 --> 12:24.764
Yes, sir.
Yes, boss.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.490
We will prove that
Francis Donald Green

12:26.640 --> 12:28.802
did feloniously and maliciously

12:28.960 --> 12:31.247
murder Bernard Hugh Dalton

12:31.400 --> 12:34.085
and, Your Honour,
so egregious is this crime,

12:34.240 --> 12:37.722
we will be seeking
the death penalty.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.444
You were present at St Vincent's

12:53.600 --> 12:58.049
when Mr Tomlinson first named
the accused as Mr Dalton's murderer?

12:58.200 --> 12:59.531
I was, yes.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.250
Who else was present?

13:01.400 --> 13:03.767
The surgeon, two nurses.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.082
And you were present
when Mr Tomlinson

13:06.240 --> 13:08.641
gave his sworn deposition
in front of the coroner?

13:08.800 --> 13:09.801
Yes.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.610
Was anyone else present?

13:11.760 --> 13:16.163
A typist, the accused

13:16.320 --> 13:19.483
and another possible suspect
who we released for want of evidence.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.610
Were any of those people Mrs Leigh?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.091
Kate Leigh wasn't there.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.926
I escorted her out of the room myself
before the coroner arrived.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.802
But Mrs Leigh has been in the room
with Mr Tomlinson?

13:38.960 --> 13:40.962
Prior to the coroner arriving, yes.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.770
She was alone with him?

13:44.520 --> 13:45.851
Yes.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.082
So they could have
discussed anything?

13:48.240 --> 13:49.651
I suppose, but I...

13:49.800 --> 13:51.962
Thank you, Senior Constable.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.884
But I don't think she wanted Tomlinson
naming names.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.371
In her mind...
Thank you.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.409
Senior Constable, your speculations

13:57.560 --> 14:01.246
on what Mrs Leigh may have had
in her mind are not admissible.

14:22.240 --> 14:25.642
All the Crown
really had was Wally Tomlinson.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.600
I saw Green standing in the street
holding a gun.

14:29.760 --> 14:33.606
He said, âCop this, you bastards,â
and started firing.

14:33.760 --> 14:37.162
Pretty much their entire case
rested on his credibility.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.721
I don't know how many bullets
hit Barney.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.726
He was lying on
the footpath, bleeding.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.407
I went to him,
stooped down to pick him up

14:47.560 --> 14:49.688
and then...

14:49.840 --> 14:53.640
I got one in the arm
and Green came over

14:53.800 --> 14:58.840
and he stood over me
and he shot me again, in the chest...

15:00.880 --> 15:03.486
point-blank range.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.927
Wally was a good witness.

15:06.080 --> 15:11.211
The trouble was the defense knew
all about Kate and Tilly's feud.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.442
Mr Tomlinson,

15:13.600 --> 15:17.525
when did Mrs Kate Leigh
first visit you at the hospital?

15:17.680 --> 15:20.729
I don't know who I saw there.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.884
I mean, I was in a pretty bad way.

15:24.040 --> 15:28.523
Kate Leigh is the head of one of these
underworld gangs, is she not?

15:28.680 --> 15:30.569
I couldn't say.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.451
But you know her pretty well.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.168
We're friends.
Yes.

15:38.320 --> 15:42.325
And the accused is known to have
worked for Mrs Matilda Devine,

15:42.480 --> 15:44.289
is he not?

15:44.440 --> 15:45.851
That's what I've heard.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.404
And Mrs Devine is the leader
of another underworld gang,

15:51.560 --> 15:53.403
a rival gang to Mrs Leigh's?

15:53.560 --> 15:56.006
I couldn't say.
I've heard tell, but, you know...

15:56.160 --> 16:00.563
Will you deny
your friend Kate Leigh

16:00.720 --> 16:02.529
mentioned Mr Green's name to you

16:02.680 --> 16:07.004
before you named him
in your dying deposition?

16:07.160 --> 16:11.848
Uh, his name may have passed
between us over the years.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.243
Will you deny
Mrs Leigh had instructed you

16:15.400 --> 16:19.405
to carry out certain plans
in relation to Frank Green?

16:23.520 --> 16:26.285
Yeah, I do deny it.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.369
Mrs Leigh! Mrs Leigh!
Move aside, would yas?!

16:36.520 --> 16:38.443
What did you really say to Wally
in the hospital?

16:38.600 --> 16:40.682
Have a word for your friend Tilly?
Is is true, Kate?

16:40.840 --> 16:42.444
Did you send Dalton
and Tomlinson after Green?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.568
While Kate was feeling the pressure,

16:44.720 --> 16:46.882
Tilly was making plans

16:47.040 --> 16:49.611
to deal with the three eyewitnesses
to the murder -

16:49.760 --> 16:54.049
Tom Kelly, Edward Brady
and Charles Connors.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.521
I asked youse here today

16:56.680 --> 17:01.083
'cause you're all appearing as witnesses
in my man Frankie's trial.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.571
I wanna assure you, Miss Devine,

17:02.720 --> 17:06.008
that these eyes witnessed nothing
outside the hotel that day.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.925
What about you, Mr Brady,
with your injured claw?

17:10.079 --> 17:12.526
You're gonna tell the court
what exactly?

17:12.680 --> 17:16.651
That I was too drunk
to see the face of my assailant.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.087
I don't talk to cops.
Everyone knows that.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.242
Well, that's all fine and dandy,

17:21.400 --> 17:24.801
but I'd like to make
dead sure of a thing

17:24.960 --> 17:27.008
so that when you're in that box

17:27.160 --> 17:29.766
you're not simply saying
you didn't see nothing,

17:29.920 --> 17:31.763
you're saying you saw
somebody else entirely

17:31.920 --> 17:33.763
put the rounds into
Dalton and Tomlinson,

17:33.920 --> 17:35.570
somebody not Frankie Green.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.007
Sensational
scenes in Darlinghurst Court today

17:57.160 --> 17:58.491
as Frank Green's defense

17:58.640 --> 18:00.881
brought forth a trio
of stalwart witnesses.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.169
Mr Connors claimed to have enjoyed
an unobstructed view

18:04.320 --> 18:06.288
of the entire violent episode.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.886
Mr Brady confirmed Mr Connor's story,

18:09.040 --> 18:12.931
saying the miscreant, whose weapon
has left his shearing hand crippled,

18:13.080 --> 18:15.401
was definitely not the accused

18:15.560 --> 18:18.564
while Mr Kelly recalled
with piercing clarity

18:18.720 --> 18:21.371
that the shooter was dark,
thickset and nuggety,

18:21.520 --> 18:24.524
wearing a distinctive pale-grey suit.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.728
It wasn't that bad.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.201
Green's lawyer Windeyer's just trying to
put the wind up folk.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.691
It only takes one juror

18:30.840 --> 18:33.207
to believe that Kate put Wal up to it,
and Green walks.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.284
Shut your gob, May.
It ain't gonna happen.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.044
Wal!

18:39.040 --> 18:40.769
Cuppa?

18:42.640 --> 18:45.644
Uh, no, thanks.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.321
A cousin of mine's got
a shack up in the Blueys.

18:49.480 --> 18:52.689
I might roll my swag there
while the trial's on.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.320
Go? Why? You've already
given your evidence.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.050
No cause to leave now.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.249
Best to get them beady eyes
turned elsewhere, I reckon.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.970
Oc will drive you.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.770
I can get a train.

19:04.920 --> 19:08.322
You're not catching a fucking train.
Oc, you can take him.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.610
Wally went bush
for a couple of weeks.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.001
He needed space to think.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.769
He wasn't hiding to protect his skin.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.365
He was hiding to protect his heart.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.281
Well, where's my
big fella, then, hey?

19:46.440 --> 19:50.240
Come on. Come to Tillsie, hey?

19:50.400 --> 19:52.050
Ow!

19:52.200 --> 19:54.362
What's up with you?

19:54.520 --> 19:56.568
Nothing, that's what.
I'm tired.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.849
You have to actually
exert yourself to get tired

20:00.000 --> 20:03.083
and you haven't so much
as lifted an eyebrow in weeks.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.569
What's bothering you lately, Jim?

20:08.720 --> 20:12.441
Is it the trial? Is it Frank?

20:12.600 --> 20:14.329
It's all under control.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.881
Besides, you shouldn't
have to feel bad about it.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.725
He's the one what pulled the trigger,
not you. He's the Gunman.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.884
I'm not bothered about the trial.
I'm not bothered about Frank.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.804
The only thing bothering me is you.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.922
Having a good one?

20:49.080 --> 20:50.491
What are you doing here?

20:50.640 --> 20:52.688
Nugget's got the night off.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.491
You needed someone
to protect your house and home.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.449
Yeah.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.851
Can I just say

21:03.000 --> 21:05.082
what a friggin' honour it is

21:05.240 --> 21:08.562
to be working for a war hero
like you, Mr Devine.

21:09.760 --> 21:14.004
And if there's ever
anything I can do, well...

21:15.000 --> 21:16.445
I'm not scared of anything.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.331
Now, that's a big call, son.
It's true.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.881
I'm not scared of anything.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.922
What about that weak prick Tomlinson

21:32.080 --> 21:34.731
shooting his mouth off,
naming names?

21:34.880 --> 21:36.370
Shameful.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.729
Not scared of anything, hey?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.450
You stay.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.891
Oi! Who the hell are you?
Upstairs.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.202
What do you think you're doing?
Tomlinson - where is he?

22:04.360 --> 22:06.010
Cowering under the table.
What do you think?

22:06.160 --> 22:07.730
Piss off, mothball!

22:07.880 --> 22:09.769
Do that again
and I'll bite your nose off.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.810
Where the fuck is he, bitch?!
I told you, not here, dickhead.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.769
Ohh!

22:15.760 --> 22:17.728
He's not here, Snow.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.729
You get out of my house!

22:22.880 --> 22:26.123
I said get out of my house,
you mongrels!

22:26.280 --> 22:28.681
I know where you live!

22:32.360 --> 22:34.283
Told the cops?
Nup.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.010
What about Wally?

22:36.160 --> 22:37.969
I ain't telling him.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.361
And you ain't to go blabbing neither.

22:41.520 --> 22:45.764
Nobody knows where he's holed up.
He's... he's safe.

22:45.920 --> 22:49.163
He need the peace.
He's got enough on his plate already.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.529
Back door all good?
Yep.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.604
You can do the front one too.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.691
Yeah, what are you gonna do
if they come back?

23:02.680 --> 23:04.603
I'll look after myself.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.447
The trial's going good.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.570
It'd be nice if my wife bothered
to come and show a little support.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.767
Sorry.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.922
It's just the girls
have been so poorly.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.087
Are they better?
Yeah.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.208
Over their whooping cough?

23:27.960 --> 23:30.201
They've been asking for ya.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.521
Give them a kiss for me, then.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.370
They'd like that.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.363
It is gonna be alright, isn't it?

23:44.160 --> 23:46.367
You ain't gonna... hang?

23:46.520 --> 23:48.522
You see any crystal balls
around here?

23:48.680 --> 23:50.648
Sorry.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.724
It's just... just...

23:53.880 --> 23:56.565
Jeez, Doll, you're not the one
facing the hangman!

23:56.720 --> 23:58.245
I've been laid off.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.891
What?
I've been laid off.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.447
The factory's booted
all married women.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.329
It's only the blokes
who've still got jobs.

24:10.680 --> 24:15.288
And I've asked at Sargents,
at all the other factories,

24:15.440 --> 24:17.169
but everyone's in the same boat.

24:17.320 --> 24:20.449
Everywhere, it's queues a mile long.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.969
I'm down to my last few quid.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.761
I don't know what to do.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.685
Dear Frank,
I hope this finds you well

24:46.840 --> 24:48.410
and that you're using your time

24:48.560 --> 24:50.961
to rest up from the rigours
of your working life.

24:51.120 --> 24:54.249
Mr Windeyer assures me
all is going well with your trial,

24:54.400 --> 24:58.246
though he is most particular
about not speaking out of school.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.768
Fingers crossed we have you back
with us where you belong soon.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.365
Regards, Tilly.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.763
P. S. Jim sends his very best. â

25:06.920 --> 25:08.843
His very best. â

25:18.440 --> 25:20.329
Got blue balls again, do you, mate?

25:44.840 --> 25:47.241
Mighty nice
to see you, Nellie.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.641
To what do I owe the pleasure?

25:49.800 --> 25:53.600
Well, I was thinking
about your offer

25:53.760 --> 25:55.922
that I come back and work for you.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.880
Well, you know there's always a place
for someone of your special talents

26:00.040 --> 26:02.008
in my humble establishment.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.810
Thank you, Tilly.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.725
Of course, nothing's worth
what it used to be,

26:06.880 --> 26:09.281
so I'll be taking 50% of your earn.

26:11.720 --> 26:12.721
50%?

26:12.880 --> 26:14.928
Or you could keep on
shifting for yourself.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.923
The door's right there. Milk?

26:22.280 --> 26:24.726
Mum? Mum? Mum?

26:24.880 --> 26:28.407
Will we see Daddy in the court?
Yes, sweetie.

26:28.560 --> 26:32.042
Remember what I told you -
he can't talk to us.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.726
He's gotta make a very important speech
to the judge.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.644
Can I wave at him?
No.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.802
Can I blow him a kiss?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.088
Yeah, he'd like that.

26:41.240 --> 26:44.323
I'm gonna blow Daddy a kiss.

26:54.480 --> 27:00.010
I know absolutely nothing about
the shooting of Barney Dalton. Nothing.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.324
I do not know why Tomlinson has
come and told these lies about me.

27:04.480 --> 27:08.371
I have never carried
a revolver in my life

27:08.520 --> 27:11.808
and there is not a living soul
who can say I have.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.769
A few dead ones
might argue the case, but.

27:13.920 --> 27:17.641
I have always fought a fair fight
with my bare knuckles.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.610
There is only one thing
that I can think of

27:20.760 --> 27:24.481
of why Tomlinson has come here
to tell these lies

27:24.640 --> 27:28.361
and that is to shelter the woman
he has lived with,

27:28.520 --> 27:34.687
the woman... in that box, Kate Leigh.

27:34.840 --> 27:38.481
This woman hates me and my employer
like poison.

27:38.640 --> 27:45.171
That is the only thing I can see
why Tomlinson should say these things.

27:47.280 --> 27:52.241
I know nothing about the shooting
and I am innocent.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.366
While the 12
good men and true of the jury

27:56.520 --> 28:00.445
went off to decide whether to send
Frank Green to the gallows,

28:00.600 --> 28:03.922
Jim Devine went on targeting
Wally Tomlinson,

28:04.080 --> 28:07.527
determined to prove
he was still as 'big' as even

28:10.200 --> 28:13.204
Get into it!

28:22.040 --> 28:24.247
Fuck off from my house!

28:24.400 --> 28:25.731
I'm gonna kill Tomlinson.
Fetch him out!

28:25.880 --> 28:28.963
I told you before - he's not here.
Now I've got a gun.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.929
A gun?

28:33.680 --> 28:36.081
Now bring out Tomlinson.
We want Tomlinson!

28:36.240 --> 28:38.322
Bring him out here right now!
I won't tell you again.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.801
If you try to come into
my house, I'll shoot ya!

28:40.960 --> 28:43.850
Bring out Tomlinson right now!

28:56.800 --> 29:00.441
Get up, old bitch!

29:00.600 --> 29:03.001
We know Tomlinson's here!

29:03.160 --> 29:05.288
We know he's your fancy man!

29:05.440 --> 29:07.363
Got him tucked up under
your eiderdown, have ya?

29:07.520 --> 29:09.204
Bring out the...

29:09.360 --> 29:11.522
Come another inch and I'll shoot ya.

29:12.840 --> 29:16.208
Yeah, right.
I mean it. I'll shoot.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.930
Help! Help me!

29:30.080 --> 29:34.210
Joe, don't leave me! Don't leave me!

29:34.360 --> 29:36.124
Help me!

29:37.560 --> 29:40.040
Arggh!

29:40.200 --> 29:43.044
Joe, don't leave me, please.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.123
Please don't leave me! Ohh!

29:50.440 --> 29:52.966
Ohh! Ohh!

29:55.560 --> 29:57.005
No-one's coming for ya.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.766
Oh, Joey! Fred!

29:59.920 --> 30:01.843
Your mates deserted ya.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.162
What sort of low-life
bastard must you be?

30:04.320 --> 30:07.051
I want my mum!

30:07.200 --> 30:09.487
Mum!

30:09.640 --> 30:12.883
Mum!

30:14.000 --> 30:18.005
Mum! Oh, Mum!

30:20.280 --> 30:23.762
Mum!Mum!

30:25.920 --> 30:29.083
Mum!Mum!

30:29.240 --> 30:31.242
Mum!

30:53.400 --> 30:54.890
You've been bailed.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.204
I was aiming for his leg.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.324
Always been a shithouse shot.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.528
Jury's back.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.281
Hurry up. Do it! Jesus, Jim.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.363
Wait, wait, wait.
Cop this, you bastards.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.888
Have you reached a verdict?

31:54.040 --> 31:55.804
You fucking beauty!

31:55.960 --> 31:59.681
If that's not a poke in the eye for
Kate Leigh, I don't know what is.

31:59.840 --> 32:02.002
It's so good to have you
back with us, Frankie.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.401
And welcome to you too, Dora.
No - Dolly.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.971
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Dolly.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.442
Oh, you must be
one relieved little lady, hey?

32:09.600 --> 32:10.931
Well, come on. In you come.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.764
The champers is not getting
any bubblier.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.288
There's the free man
right there! There you are!

32:16.440 --> 32:19.205
Hey, there you are!
You're a free man.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.691
Good job.
Cheers.

32:20.840 --> 32:23.207
Well done, Frankie.
Good to see you, mate.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.408
Good to see you. Nice work.
Yeah.

32:28.120 --> 32:32.250
Where's my number one man?
I always knew you'd be acquitted, mate.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.524
This is my missus.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.603
Charmed.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.884
Oh, forget that shit.
Till, where's the Scotch?

32:42.040 --> 32:44.042
Gwynnie, change that bloody music.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.443
Is this a party or ain't it?!
Hooray!

32:57.200 --> 32:58.770
Hooray!

33:07.720 --> 33:09.643
Bugger this.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.690
May, get cracking.
Oc, put the word out.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.330
What?

33:15.320 --> 33:16.651
I'm throwing you a party.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.450
Kate, no!
Don't you say no to me.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.648
Don't you dare say no.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.641
I'm not gonna let that
Pommy bitch win, you hear?

33:24.800 --> 33:26.325
She's not gonna win.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.084
So how does it feel, Frank?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.527
Thank God for this great jury system
of ours, you know?

33:30.680 --> 33:32.967
They come to the right decision.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.963
Got any words for Kate Leigh?

33:35.120 --> 33:37.851
Yeah, she's a lying so-and-so
and she's got a fat arse!

33:41.360 --> 33:43.488
You've got a beautiful family, Frank.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.608
How have they helped you
in this time?

33:45.760 --> 33:48.206
Well, Don, shes a don.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.408
You know, the kids are beauties.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.403
I wouldn't be the same man
without them...

34:49.400 --> 34:50.731
Wally?

34:53.760 --> 34:55.808
We've been waiting for ya!

35:42.760 --> 35:45.206
Wally Tomlinson took to the road,

35:45.360 --> 35:48.170
back to the bush where he'd grown up.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.926
He never returned to Razorhurst.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.969
He never married.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.362
And he never saw Kate Leigh again.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.445
Cheers.

36:24.520 --> 36:27.569
Sorry I've been a bit of a bear
with a sore head.

36:27.720 --> 36:31.122
I guess I was troubled about Frankie
facing the noose after all.

36:40.920 --> 36:42.763
Jim?

36:46.440 --> 36:49.171
You ain't never
killed anyone, have ya?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.367
In the war,

36:54.520 --> 36:57.683
in the trenches,
you never killed no-one.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.924
That's why you couldn't
kill Barney Dalton.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.846
Greg Gaffney was just
a lucky shot in the dark.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.444
Don't worry. Mum's the word.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.089
Now leave off!

37:42.280 --> 37:45.250
Ray, it's young Eddie.

37:47.720 --> 37:50.610
Eddie. Eddie! Come on, Eddie!
Ray.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.004
How many do you reckon
you'll be lighting

38:20.160 --> 38:22.083
by the time someone's lighting one
for you?

38:24.400 --> 38:27.643
If I lit a candle
for everyone I lost in my life,

38:27.800 --> 38:29.609
I'd light up this city.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.728
And it wouldn't make
one jot of difference.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.087
God would still shit on you
from a great height.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.328
Why does he do it?

38:40.480 --> 38:43.723
Men commit murder,
women sell their bodies.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.761
Why does he let a little kid die
in the street?

38:47.920 --> 38:49.843
Who died? What kid?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.331
It doesn't matter.

38:51.480 --> 38:55.280
It doesn't matter in heaven,
so why should it matter on earth?

38:55.440 --> 38:58.489
God's not a weakling, Blissett.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.769
He looks after them
who look after themselves.

39:06.480 --> 39:09.563
Rabbitoh! Rabbitoh!

39:09.720 --> 39:11.688
Get your fresh rabbits!

39:11.840 --> 39:15.367
Rabbitoh! Get your fresh rabbits.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.965
Rabbitoh!

39:17.120 --> 39:19.771
Get your fresh rabbits.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.763
Kate Leigh
was eventually acquitted

39:21.920 --> 39:23.809
of Snowy Prendergast's murder -

39:23.960 --> 39:28.488
justifiable homicide
on the grounds of self-defense...

39:28.640 --> 39:33.407
but his death would stay on her
conscience for the rest of her life.

39:33.560 --> 39:37.610
Rabbitoh! Get your fresh rabbits.

39:37.760 --> 39:41.003
Rabbitoh. Get your fresh rabbits.

39:41.160 --> 39:44.050
Rabbitohl Rabbitohl

40:27.080 --> 40:28.764
Hi, Ma.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.169
Eileen.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.843
Boy or girl?
Girl.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.687
What did you name her?

40:52.840 --> 40:54.808
Charlotte.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.928
After Grandma?

40:58.080 --> 40:59.570
I call her Cha-cha.

41:04.560 --> 41:08.281
I just made a brew
if you want a cuppa.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.003
Can I...?

41:12.160 --> 41:15.084
Can I please hold her?

41:15.240 --> 41:16.890
Yeah?

41:20.040 --> 41:21.610
Shh, Shh, Shh.

41:21.760 --> 41:25.287
Oh, hey. Hello.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.408
Hello.
Any bickies?

41:27.560 --> 41:29.562
Yeah, yeah, on the table in the tin.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.688
Hello, little baby girl.

41:31.840 --> 41:34.161
I'm your granny. Yeah.

41:34.320 --> 41:37.881
What do you think of that?
Oh, yeah.

41:38.040 --> 41:41.487
Oh, shh, shh. Here's your mum, hey?

41:41.640 --> 41:44.120
Hey, come here.
Have some of Granny's cookies.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.482
She looks like you, eh?

41:53.480 --> 41:56.609
Both Kate and Tilly
had cares a plenty.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.250
Bring the car round, Oc!

41:58.400 --> 42:01.529
But neither woman
was going to let private worries

42:01.680 --> 42:04.490
interfere with
what really mattered to hen

42:04.640 --> 42:10.283
Their battle was about to enter
its deadliest phase.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.125
Time to get back to work.
