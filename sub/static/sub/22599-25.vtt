19:15.322 --> 19:16.448
Metamorpho!

19:19.493 --> 19:22.621
We became the Outsiders
because we all felt we were different...

19:22.830 --> 19:25.707
...alone and unable to fit in
with everyone else.

19:25.916 --> 19:29.670
But that's what makes us, all of us,
so cool.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.135
We're a team.

Of course I did,

20:51.210 --> 20:55.005
But remember,
you're the reason they became heroes...

20:55.214 --> 20:57.257

Ahem, and let the, uh, authorities
deal with him.

22:18.839 --> 22:23.343
Speaking of authorities, keep an eye
on Psycho Pirate while I call them.
