I'm on a frickin' cow farm.

26:53.946 --> 26:57.533
Put the ranch hand on
He's not picking up his phone.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.201
Hold, please.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.416
[Manny snoring]

27:08.461 --> 27:11.297
Manny? Manny.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.923
Wake up, Manny.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.925
Manny!

27:14.967 --> 27:18.178
-Sir, he's not waking up--
-[screaming]

27:18.220 --> 27:20.889
-Good morning, sunshine.
-What is wrong with you?

27:20.931 --> 27:23.559
Give me the phone.
I got it.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.311
Hey, good morning,
boss man.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.853
What can I do you for?

27:26.895 --> 27:29.273
Hey, okay, they gave me a list
of jobs I'm supposed to do.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.191
I don't know what
half this crap means.

27:31.233 --> 27:34.194
What is "muck the pens?"

27:34.236 --> 27:35.695
Yeah, how the heck
do I "muck?"

27:35.737 --> 27:37.197
Oh, uh, yeah,
that's easy.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.656
All you gotta do is
shovel the cow--

27:38.698 --> 27:40.576
[cows lowing loudly]

27:40.618 --> 27:42.369
What?

27:52.254 --> 27:55.299
Okay, Houston, I'm headed
to the gulag.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.883
Here's-- behind you,
behind you.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.096
Hey.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.098
Call of Duty
or Halo?

28:03.140 --> 28:05.476
-Syrah or Noir?
-Leo...

28:05.518 --> 28:07.936
I promise you, if you play
Call of Duty with me,

28:07.978 --> 28:10.814
you can open my eyes
to the world of Pino New-ear.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.483
It's "Noir."

28:18.113 --> 28:20.032
Gosh dang it.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.286
[axe creaking]

28:26.372 --> 28:27.247
[cell phone ringing]

28:27.289 --> 28:30.376
Okay, let's go again.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.377
Yes, sir.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.962
Hey, can you put
the ranch hand on?

28:34.004 --> 28:36.840
I got my axe stuck
in a stump.

28:36.882 --> 28:37.883
-Manny?
-What?

28:37.924 --> 28:42.137
His axe is stuck
in a stump.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.847
Hey, I got a question for ya.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.724
If you take a squat
on a stump and take a dump,

28:45.765 --> 28:47.518
does it become a
toilet-tree?

28:47.560 --> 28:49.102
-Oh, god.
-[mock laughter]

28:49.144 --> 28:50.479
Yeah, that's funny.
Okay, seriously.

28:50.521 --> 28:51.980
What do I do?

28:52.022 --> 28:53.773
All right, all you gotta do
is kick the handle sideways,

28:53.815 --> 28:56.610
and, uh, that'll loosen it.

28:56.652 --> 28:57.903
All right,
I'm gonna try it.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.446
Hold on.

29:09.331 --> 29:10.374
I got it.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.667
Hey, that worked.
Thank you so much.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.377
-I appreciate it.
-It worked!

29:13.419 --> 29:15.546
-Good!
-Great.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.256
Joseph, do you really think
this plan of yours

29:17.297 --> 29:18.465
in gonna work?

29:18.507 --> 29:20.175
Have you even spoken
with your mother yet?

29:20.217 --> 29:21.719
Hadouken!

29:26.599 --> 29:29.059
I gotta go, sir.
Good luck!

29:29.101 --> 29:31.061
Hello?

29:31.103 --> 29:33.731
It was worth it.
You should see the other guy.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.780
Yes, I am aware
that we are behind, sir,

29:41.821 --> 29:44.866
but you have my word
we are good for it this month.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.831
Yes, I did.
I did see the notice.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.709
But like I said,
you have my word.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.264
What do we have left?

30:18.484 --> 30:20.277
[weak groan]

30:22.237 --> 30:24.490
Ooh, how does it feel?

30:24.531 --> 30:27.743
Ooh... how does it feel?

30:27.785 --> 30:30.370
No, no, no, no!
Oh!

30:30.412 --> 30:33.707
-Yes!
-Player two wins.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.250
A for effort, son.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.252
Oh, don't talk all proper,
Leo, okay?

30:37.294 --> 30:40.380
No one likes a bragger.

30:40.422 --> 30:43.133
I won like three times
before you.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.844
-Yes, sir.
-Hey, put Manny on.

30:45.885 --> 30:48.639
-Manny, for you.
-Hmm.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.890
-Yeah, boss.
-Exactly how do you milk a cow?

30:50.932 --> 30:52.768
Oh, uh, milking a cow
is easy-peasy.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.020
All you gotta do is
pull down on the teats.

30:55.061 --> 30:58.565
Yeah, that's what I'm trying,
but nothing is happening.

30:59.692 --> 31:02.653
Hannah!

31:02.695 --> 31:04.613
What's going on?

31:04.655 --> 31:08.033
- Boss? Hello?

31:08.074 --> 31:11.161
You have to roll it
through your fingers.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.996
- No, I know,
I was just gettin'--

31:13.038 --> 31:15.248
Gettin' it nice
and warmed up, you know?

31:15.290 --> 31:17.334
Now squeeze from the top
as you pull down.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.384
Hey, I got the flow going.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.803
You don't look like
your picture.

31:27.845 --> 31:29.179
Picture?

31:29.221 --> 31:31.056
What happened to
your mustache?

31:31.097 --> 31:33.183
[Callie]
Mustache?

31:33.225 --> 31:35.686
I can't picture that.

31:35.728 --> 31:37.563
Yeah, I, uh,
I got sick of it.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.941
I need your help with
the Christmas breads.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.861
-Come on.
- See ya around.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.324
[Manny]
Can we leave?

31:49.366 --> 31:50.534
Let's just get out
of here, please.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.160
Let's go out and party.

31:52.202 --> 31:53.829
All right, I'm, like,
suffocating in here.

31:53.871 --> 31:56.164
It smells like wine.

31:56.206 --> 31:57.416
Can't do that.
Boss's orders.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.460
Fine, then we'll
party here, then.

32:00.502 --> 32:01.837
Woah, woah, woah.
Stop.

32:01.879 --> 32:03.213
-Mmm.
-What are you doing?

32:03.255 --> 32:06.091
Lesson one, never drink
out of a wine bottle

32:06.132 --> 32:07.718
like a heathen
ever again.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.599
Walnut and cocoa bean.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.851
What did you say?

32:15.893 --> 32:18.478
Walnut and cocoa bean.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.481
How did you know that?

32:21.523 --> 32:23.358
Pretty easy, Leo.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.985
You can just taste it.

32:26.027 --> 32:29.155
It's like tasting
an apple in apple juice.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.033
[chickens clucking]

32:45.422 --> 32:47.173
Gosh dang it.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.178
Hey, little guy.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.464
Strike one.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.843
I need you to
come with me please.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.511
Okay.

34:16.972 --> 34:20.141
I just need the ladder
to get the feed bags, please.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.310
Sure thing.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.819
Sorry.

34:30.861 --> 34:32.320
All right.

34:55.468 --> 34:57.846
They're all expired.

34:57.888 --> 34:59.681
Okay, I'll, uh,
go into town tomorrow

34:59.723 --> 35:01.850
-and pick some up.
-Great.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.565
So did you notice
the feed bins were empty?

35:08.607 --> 35:09.816
What?

35:09.858 --> 35:12.360
The feed bins for
the cows were empty.

35:12.402 --> 35:14.362
Meaning they
haven't eaten today.

35:14.404 --> 35:16.114
Yeah, but that wasn't
on my list, so...

35:16.155 --> 35:17.741
Okay, well, neither is
"take a shower"

35:17.783 --> 35:20.869
but good hygiene is still
expected on this ranch.

35:20.911 --> 35:23.246
Noted.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.873
All right, well,
if you're good for the night,

35:24.915 --> 35:26.207
I have to go to work.

35:26.249 --> 35:27.751
Isn't this
where you work?

35:27.793 --> 35:28.710
During the day.

35:28.752 --> 35:31.004
I'm a bartender
at The Brew Pub

35:31.046 --> 35:32.839
six nights a week.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.841
When do you sleep?

35:34.883 --> 35:36.301
Sleep is overrated.

35:36.342 --> 35:39.220
Do you really enjoy that?
Like, waking up super early.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.764
Going to bed super late.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.724
Is that-- is that
fun for you?

35:42.766 --> 35:45.226
-What are you doing?
- I don't know.

35:45.268 --> 35:46.728
I'm just trying to have
a conversation with you.

35:46.770 --> 35:47.604
Well, don't.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.441
Okay.

35:53.693 --> 35:57.072
And, uh, that shouldn't
be out here.

36:02.953 --> 36:04.830
Hello, you...

36:10.209 --> 36:12.754
You know, normally,
chicks run towards me

36:12.796 --> 36:15.256
instead of away from me.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.550
I'm losing my touch.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.679
Okay, okay.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.765
You're...

36:23.807 --> 36:25.767
There you go.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.727
Now where in the heck
did you get out?

36:51.877 --> 36:54.171
[line ringing]

36:54.212 --> 36:57.215
Leo, hey, it's me.
I need your help.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.342
What do ranchers
wear to a bar?

37:20.906 --> 37:22.908
[music playing,
bar chatter]

37:27.162 --> 37:29.497
Hey. What are you doing?

37:29.539 --> 37:31.083
Setting up.

37:31.124 --> 37:33.043
Ho ho ho!

37:36.129 --> 37:38.339
Hey.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.925
What's wrong?

37:41.760 --> 37:44.971
Did something happen
with your mom?

37:45.013 --> 37:47.140
No, she's the same.

37:47.182 --> 37:50.769
But today would have been
her last chemo treatment?

37:50.810 --> 37:51.895
One more try.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.646
That's all
the doctor wanted.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.899
I'm sorry, Cal.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.276
Same is good,
though, right?

37:58.317 --> 38:00.904
It doesn't
change the outcome.

38:00.946 --> 38:06.159
Sometimes you gotta
let the feelings in.

38:06.201 --> 38:08.620
They're not going
to break you, I promise.

38:08.661 --> 38:12.331
Come here.
Come here.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.211
Shut up
and play me something.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.679
Can I get
another beer, please.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.890
Okay.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.558
Hello.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.398
Hey.

38:37.440 --> 38:42.070
What are you going for?
'80s rhinestone cowboy?

38:42.112 --> 38:45.698
Well, uh, Stallone and Dolly
totally had it goin' on,

38:45.740 --> 38:49.410
so yeah.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.705
You know the movie?

38:53.706 --> 38:57.669
It's actually, uh,
my favorite.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.087
Can I get you anything?

38:59.129 --> 39:02.465
Do you guys have, like,
a Callie Special or something?

39:02.507 --> 39:05.718
I do, but not for people
who have to be up by 6:00 am.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.096
I'll take my chances.

39:08.138 --> 39:09.722
Okay...

39:09.764 --> 39:11.850
One Petaluma Slamma
coming up.

39:29.784 --> 39:30.952
What are you doing?

39:30.994 --> 39:32.245
I thought I told you
to stay in the truck.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.122
I wanted to see what
all the hubbub was about,

39:34.164 --> 39:37.375
plus I got dressed up.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.338
I approve.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.464
There's an entire seat
between us.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.383
Everything is fine.

39:45.424 --> 39:47.510
-I told you--
-And here you go.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.762
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.015
[Leo]
Excuse me, ma'am.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.684
Is there a corkage fee?

39:56.644 --> 40:00.648
-Don't worry about it.
-Much obliged.

40:00.690 --> 40:04.152
Don't look at me!

40:04.194 --> 40:06.487
You know, you never thanked me
for finding our friend--

40:06.529 --> 40:08.031
Manny!

40:08.073 --> 40:12.077
-What is goin' on?
-This isn't gonna be good.

40:16.206 --> 40:18.541
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

40:18.583 --> 40:21.169
Leo, I told you, I needed
to get out of there, okay?

40:21.211 --> 40:23.755
All right? I'm a dragon,
and you need to let me fly.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.674
Callie Bernet, who is
working behind the bar,

40:26.716 --> 40:29.052
is the one who
hired "Manny."

40:29.094 --> 40:31.930
And the other "Manny"
is also here.

40:31.971 --> 40:35.308
-You have to leave, now.
-I'm so sorry.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.269
-No, I had no idea.
-What are you doing?

40:37.310 --> 40:39.145
Uh, hey, me...

40:39.187 --> 40:40.646
- Yeah, okay, look.
I'll pay you more money,

40:40.688 --> 40:41.564
but you gotta go
right now.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.066
- Hey, Manny!
-Connor!

40:43.108 --> 40:45.193
-What's up, buddy.
-Hey, good to see you.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.444
Who are your friends?

40:46.485 --> 40:50.156
Uh, well, this
Prince-looking guy is Leo,

40:50.198 --> 40:53.701
and, uh, this... is...

40:53.743 --> 40:56.454
also Manny.

40:56.495 --> 40:57.956
-Another Manny?
-Yup.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.333
-No way?
-Mm-hmm.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.835
Guys...

41:02.877 --> 41:04.587
nice outfits.

41:04.629 --> 41:05.922
Thank you very much.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.215
Manny here works at
the Bernet ranch--

41:07.257 --> 41:09.175
[clearing throat]

41:09.217 --> 41:10.343
-Hmm?
-Huh?

41:10.385 --> 41:13.221
Uh, shoot.

41:13.263 --> 41:17.976
I just realized that
I'm drunk already.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.727
-You can't smell it?
-I'll give you a ride.

41:19.769 --> 41:20.979

58:18.662 --> 58:22.124
What are you
talking about?

58:22.166 --> 58:25.836
We've been drowning
in debt for months.

58:25.877 --> 58:28.505
And I don't
see a way out.

58:28.546 --> 58:32.092
I can't tell you
how helpless I feel.

58:32.134 --> 58:34.386
Some big city company
wants to buy our land

58:34.428 --> 58:37.139
for a shipping facility.

58:37.181 --> 58:39.766
Yeah, but you could--
you could take the money

58:39.808 --> 58:42.644
and buy an even
better ranch, you know?

58:42.686 --> 58:44.521
It's not about the money.

58:44.562 --> 58:46.773
It's this land.

58:46.815 --> 58:48.275
Every single one
of my memories

58:48.317 --> 58:51.236
with my mom and dad
are from here.

58:51.278 --> 58:55.157
Pretty soon, this place will be
all I have left of both of them.

58:58.452 --> 59:02.414
I know there's a way out.
I know there is.

59:02.456 --> 59:05.792
I just... I haven't
figured it out yet.

59:12.549 --> 59:14.301
What's this?

59:14.343 --> 59:16.303

59:16.345 --> 59:19.681
My fiancé.

59:19.723 --> 59:23.310
He was with my dad
when he crashed.

59:23.352 --> 59:26.813
We were going to buy
Christmas lights.

59:26.855 --> 59:28.815
We?

59:38.742 --> 59:43.038
Oh, my gosh, Callie,
I am so sorry.

59:43.080 --> 59:45.916
They were gone so fast.

59:45.957 --> 59:48.335
In the blink of an eye.

59:48.377 --> 59:51.713
And now with my mom
ending her chemo early,

59:51.755 --> 59:55.842
she said it was
worse than dying.

59:55.884 --> 1:00:01.223
She's fading so slowly.

1:00:01.265 --> 1:00:05.436
I don't... I don't
know which one is worse.

1:00:05.477 --> 1:00:08.397
But I bet heaven
looks just like this.

1:00:12.484 --> 1:00:16.863
Except on Christmas,
the hills are covered in snow.

1:00:16.905 --> 1:00:19.491
I've never seen it,
you know.

1:00:19.533 --> 1:00:21.368
Snow?

1:00:21.410 --> 1:00:23.370
-Yeah.
-What?

1:00:23.412 --> 1:00:26.123
It doesn't snow around here,

1:00:26.164 --> 1:00:28.292
and I haven't really had
the chance to leave.

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:42.931
Callie, I, uh....

1:00:44.182 --> 1:00:46.184

1:01:12.919 --> 1:01:14.171
I, uh...

1:01:14.212 --> 1:01:16.756
I should probably
go see who that is.

1:01:16.798 --> 1:01:18.425
Yeah.

1:01:25.807 --> 1:01:29.561
Connor? Can I help you?

1:01:29.603 --> 1:01:31.396
I was just driving
around the area,

1:01:31.438 --> 1:01:32.689
thought I'd come by.

1:01:32.730 --> 1:01:34.316
You've got
to stop "coming by."

1:01:34.358 --> 1:01:36.360
-I'm not interested--
-It's Manny, isn't it?

1:01:38.236 --> 1:01:40.947
I forgot, you
two have already met.

1:01:40.989 --> 1:01:42.658
You know my friend
Manny, right?

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:44.784
You two work together
on another ranch

1:01:44.826 --> 1:01:46.953
or something together?

1:01:46.995 --> 1:01:49.206
It's so odd.

Two Mannys in
this tiny little town.

1:01:52.501 --> 1:01:53.960
Have you seen my friend Manny?

1:01:54.002 --> 1:01:55.462
-'Cause I--
-Look, I don't--

1:01:55.504 --> 1:01:57.714
I don't want any trouble.

1:01:57.755 --> 1:02:01.218
All right? So why don't we
start that introduction over.

1:02:01.259 --> 1:02:03.470
-Shall we?
-Connor.

1:02:03.512 --> 1:02:06.473
Hey. Look at me.

1:02:06.515 --> 1:02:08.766
Hey, Liam would hate
to see you like this.

1:02:17.234 --> 1:02:19.277
I'd like you to
leave now, please.

1:02:39.297 --> 1:02:42.008

1:02:42.050 --> 1:02:43.343
I'm sorry.

1:02:43.385 --> 1:02:45.596
He's... he's had
a hard couple of years.

1:02:45.637 --> 1:02:47.889
I mean, we all have
around here.

1:02:47.931 --> 1:02:51.893
He was a good friend
of Liam's.

1:02:51.935 --> 1:02:54.730
The whole town was.

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:56.898
Liam sounds like he
was an awesome guy.

1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:58.442
Yeah, he was.

1:03:02.070 --> 1:03:05.657
Keep this.

1:03:05.699 --> 1:03:07.825
Maybe we can
finish it later.

Leo, hey.

1:03:14.832 --> 1:03:16.668
I have to tell
Callie the truth.

1:03:16.710 --> 1:03:19.796
The deal is supposed
to close tomorrow.

1:03:19.837 --> 1:03:22.173
Have you spoken
to your mother?

1:03:22.215 --> 1:03:23.300
Almost.

1:03:23.341 --> 1:03:25.927
And by almost, you mean...

1:03:25.969 --> 1:03:27.929

Can I talk to
you about something?

1:03:52.621 --> 1:03:54.331

to try the chemo once more?

Mom, the doctor said
trying one more time

1:07:34.342 --> 1:07:37.679
could give your lungs

-I was with my dad.
-Really?

1:17:36.986 --> 1:17:39.738
He said the stars were brighter
at the edge of the property.

1:17:44.494 --> 1:17:47.704
And, uh,
that old dairy barn,

1:17:47.746 --> 1:17:51.208
that was his last
unfinished project.

1:17:51.250 --> 1:17:54.128

into something magical one day.

-A jigsaw.

1:18:01.511 --> 1:18:04.721

It was usually
every other weekend,

1:18:19.736 --> 1:18:22.448
and he was working
on some engine.

1:18:22.490 --> 1:18:24.367
I remember one summer,

1:18:24.408 --> 1:18:26.994
we completely
rebuilt the garage.

It was a tool bench,

1:18:29.288 --> 1:18:32.833

the whole-the whole thing.

1:18:32.875 --> 1:18:35.127
It was awesome.

1:18:35.169 --> 1:18:38.130

I've ever tasted.

1:27:58.690 --> 1:28:00.192
Does she sell this?

1:28:00.234 --> 1:28:03.653
No, they just gift it
to friends and family.

1:28:03.695 --> 1:28:06.115

1:30:52.406 --> 1:30:55.742
And that is exactly
why I am here.

1:30:55.784 --> 1:30:57.493
So come on, man,
just let me make it right.

1:30:57.535 --> 1:30:59.371
And then, if you want
to kill me, fine.

1:30:59.413 --> 1:31:02.624
Kill me.

1:31:02.665 --> 1:31:04.918
We both know
I deserve it.

1:31:11.049 --> 1:31:13.885
Connor, we want
the same thing.

1:31:13.927 --> 1:31:16.638
Yeah, and what's that?

1:31:16.679 --> 1:31:19.641
Callie's happiness.

1:31:19.682 --> 1:31:22.060
I might have a way to
give some of it back.

1:31:27.149 --> 1:31:29.985
I thought I saw someone
working up here.

1:31:30.026 --> 1:31:31.861
I told you to get
off my property.

1:31:31.903 --> 1:31:34.781
Please tell me that you haven't
signed the contract yet.

1:31:34.823 --> 1:31:36.490
What do you think?

1:31:36.532 --> 1:31:38.994
I just... could you
put the shotgun down

1:31:39.035 --> 1:31:40.329
and hear me out?

1:31:40.370 --> 1:31:43.332
I have an idea that might
help you save the ranch.

1:31:44.540 --> 1:31:48.170
Fine. In the late 1800s,
there was a parasite

1:31:48.211 --> 1:31:49.879
called phylloxera
that wiped out

1:31:49.921 --> 1:31:51.505
some of the most
prestigious of wineries

1:31:51.547 --> 1:31:53.258
-in all of Bordeaux, France.
-What are you talking about?

1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:55.509
But, a few years
before the parasite hit,

1:31:55.551 --> 1:31:59.389
immigrants from France brought
grape vines over in suitcases,

1:31:59.431 --> 1:32:01.683
to plant them in the rich soils
of Northern California,

1:32:01.724 --> 1:32:06.146
creating years of coveted legacy
in every single grape.

1:32:06.188 --> 1:32:08.815
Gosh, don't you get it, Cal?
Your dad was right.

1:32:08.857 --> 1:32:11.485
These grapes, the wine,
they could save your ranch.

1:32:14.696 --> 1:32:17.157
Now, I know a guy,
and he can come out here,

1:32:17.199 --> 1:32:18.825
he can sample the wine,
and he'll tell you

1:32:18.867 --> 1:32:21.077
-what the grapes are worth.
-There it is.

1:32:21.119 --> 1:32:23.579
The knight in shining armor
coming back to save the day

1:32:23.621 --> 1:32:25.539
-after all.
-Not exactly.

1:32:25.581 --> 1:32:27.625
I told him the grapes
were well taken care of.

1:33:21.388 --> 1:33:23.515
This is it.

1:33:53.587 --> 1:33:55.964
This is the barrel room.

1:33:58.216 --> 1:34:01.928
French oak.

1:34:01.970 --> 1:34:04.431
-May I?
-Of course.

1:34:04.473 --> 1:34:05.557
Oh!

1:34:38.131 --> 1:34:40.800
On behalf of the
Barrel Room Wine Club,

1:34:40.842 --> 1:34:42.594
we are interested in
leasing your vines

1:34:42.636 --> 1:34:46.222
on limited distribution.

1:34:46.264 --> 1:34:47.932
Okay...

1:34:47.974 --> 1:34:50.602
We'd be happy to take
your current inventory tomorrow.

1:34:50.644 --> 1:34:52.479
If you agree on the price,

1:34:52.521 --> 1:34:55.982
we can bring the lease
agreement upon pickup.

1:34:56.024 --> 1:34:59.319
It looks like
you've got around...

1:34:59.361 --> 1:35:01.196
40 cases.

1:35:01.237 --> 1:35:04.240
And several full French
oak barrels, so...

1:35:16.127 --> 1:35:18.588
My number's on the bottom.

1:35:18.630 --> 1:35:21.007
If you're happy with
the price, give me a call.

1:35:21.049 --> 1:35:23.009
Oh, and the monthly
lease payment,

1:35:23.051 --> 1:35:24.511
plus your commission
on the sales

1:35:24.553 --> 1:35:26.888
should be around at least
half of that each month.

1:35:31.184 --> 1:35:33.019
What do you think,
Ms. Bernet?

1:35:35.647 --> 1:35:39.108
Mom.

1:35:39.150 --> 1:35:40.485
What?

1:35:40.527 --> 1:35:42.820
-We did it.
-What's this?

1:35:46.575 --> 1:35:49.661
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, honey!

1:35:55.542 --> 1:35:58.670
Oh, my gosh!
Oh!

1:35:58.712 --> 1:36:01.214
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
I love you so much.

1:36:28.742 --> 1:36:31.703
No way.
That's the latest system.

1:36:31.745 --> 1:36:36.040
Special limited edition.

1:36:36.082 --> 1:36:39.210
Oh... oh.

1:36:41.879 --> 1:36:44.048
Okay.

1:36:44.090 --> 1:36:45.759
Don't get emotional.

1:36:49.387 --> 1:36:50.680
Look, I'm sorry, mom,

1:36:50.722 --> 1:36:52.724
but this was
the right thing to do.

1:36:52.766 --> 1:36:54.726
I know it's bad for business,
bad for the company,

1:36:54.768 --> 1:36:56.060
but I had to do it.

1:36:56.102 --> 1:36:58.480
I just-- I've never seen you
so passionate about,

1:36:58.521 --> 1:37:00.231
-well, anything...
-There's nothing you can say

1:37:00.273 --> 1:37:01.566
-to convince me otherwise--
-Joseph...

1:37:01.608 --> 1:37:04.235
-Because I finally understand--
-Joseph!

1:37:06.404 --> 1:37:09.324
I'm actually proud of you.

1:37:09.365 --> 1:37:11.033
Mom?

1:37:14.870 --> 1:37:17.873
For what it's worth,

1:37:17.915 --> 1:37:20.168
the position is still yours
if you want it.

1:37:23.171 --> 1:37:28.009
Thanks, but...

1:37:28.050 --> 1:37:30.052
I think I'm good.

1:37:38.186 --> 1:37:40.854
Okay, do you how many guests
we have on the list?

1:37:40.896 --> 1:37:42.607
Because last year we didn't
have enough brownies,

1:37:42.649 --> 1:37:47.278
and it was--
What is going on here?

1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:48.904
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

1:37:50.906 --> 1:37:52.742
Well, we just...

1:37:52.784 --> 1:37:55.161
We just thought maybe
we'd have the Christmas party

1:37:55.203 --> 1:37:59.248
in the old-- in the old
dairy barn this year.

1:37:59.290 --> 1:38:02.335
Are you kidding me?
That place is a wreck.

1:38:04.546 --> 1:38:06.798
Tell me right now.

1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:11.093
Well... why don't we
just show you?

1:38:21.062 --> 1:38:23.105
Go on.

1:38:33.074 --> 1:38:34.534
Mom!

1:38:34.576 --> 1:38:36.828
Oh, it's so magical,
isn't it?

1:38:36.870 --> 1:38:40.289
I don't know what to say.

1:38:40.331 --> 1:38:42.166
How-how did you
do this?

1:38:42.208 --> 1:38:44.918
I didn't.

1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:48.548
I helped a little bit.

1:38:48.590 --> 1:38:52.594
Give him a chance, okay?

1:38:52.635 --> 1:38:55.012
Oh, my goodness.

1:39:11.487 --> 1:39:13.281
Clever shirt.

1:39:16.910 --> 1:39:20.996
-Saves on the small talk.
-Yeah.

1:39:21.038 --> 1:39:23.082
Okay, until you get
your shotgun,

1:39:23.124 --> 1:39:25.000
I think I have at least
a few minutes.

1:39:25.042 --> 1:39:28.129
Better make it good then.

1:39:28.170 --> 1:39:30.214
All right, um,
listen, Callie,

1:39:30.256 --> 1:39:32.634
I-I want you to know,
the entire time

1:39:32.675 --> 1:39:37.012
that I was working
for you, it sucked.

1:39:37.054 --> 1:39:38.389
It was the absolute worst.

1:39:38.431 --> 1:39:39.973
You know, I-I was cold,
I was tired,

1:39:40.015 --> 1:39:42.769
and I smelled like a cow's ass
the entire time.

1:39:42.811 --> 1:39:45.521
Yeah, I remember
that part.

1:39:45.563 --> 1:39:48.023
But it was the best time
of my life.

1:39:51.152 --> 1:39:54.906
And I'd give anything
to go back to that.

1:39:54.948 --> 1:39:58.117
Well, your position
has been filled.

1:39:58.159 --> 1:40:00.244
Yeah, we got
a new ranch hand.

1:40:00.286 --> 1:40:04.540
He's good, too.
Experienced.

1:40:04.582 --> 1:40:07.042
Okay.

1:40:07.084 --> 1:40:09.420
But...

1:40:09.462 --> 1:40:12.841
I might be able to figure out
something for you to do.

1:40:17.595 --> 1:40:20.139
Well, I would need
meals this time.

1:40:20.181 --> 1:40:22.767
Oh, yeah. No.

1:40:22.809 --> 1:40:25.311
Meals are not
usually included.

1:40:25.353 --> 1:40:28.314
And I would need
a place to sleep.

1:40:28.356 --> 1:40:31.400
I think I can swing that.

1:40:31.442 --> 1:40:33.235
And you.

1:40:55.591 --> 1:40:57.301
That was so sweet.

1:40:57.343 --> 1:40:59.637
That was...
So sweet.

1:41:04.517 --> 1:41:06.602
I thought you were
long overdue.
