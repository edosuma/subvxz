a cure for me...

would have told him not to move.

I'm a burden sometimes.

to be a burden.

what's real with him.

I mean, he's convinced there's
a way to really save me...

14:33.938 --> 14:36.908
but I don't know, he drove away
my mom trying to find a cure.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.911
My mom's gone, too.

14:38.943 --> 14:40.144

and she wanted me to keep
all of this secret.

11, almost 12.

27:51.402 --> 27:55.373
Hm, wow, happy almost birthday
to you.

28:23.299 --> 28:25.936
Sorry, you scared me.

28:29.973 --> 28:33.243
I thought maybe since you
dropped by on me, I might--

28:33.277 --> 28:34.144
Drop by also.

28:34.178 --> 28:37.148
Yeah, but I didn't mean
to almost break...

28:37.181 --> 28:38.915
your dad's things, though.

28:38.949 --> 28:42.787
Don't worry about those ships.
He's got tons of junk here.

28:42.819 --> 28:44.422
I like this one.

28:48.125 --> 28:54.132
Ah, the wailing stick,
it's used to kill large fish.

28:54.164 --> 28:56.032
They say the ball
at the other end...

28:56.066 --> 28:57.535
is used to call them to shore.

28:57.567 --> 29:00.771
Its tip can pierce
through tough skin.

29:00.805 --> 29:04.842
Some fish, the kind that you
might read about.

29:04.875 --> 29:08.813
Well, some fish, they are quite
difficult to catch.

29:08.846 --> 29:10.882
I didn't really read a lot
of books about fish.

29:10.914 --> 29:12.750
No?

29:15.519 --> 29:18.923
Your mom doesn't tell you
any stories?

29:18.955 --> 29:20.824
Are you guys hunters?

29:20.857 --> 29:22.159
Depends on what's being hunted.

29:28.499 --> 29:31.434
That's a tranquilizer gun,
it's not for kids.

29:31.468 --> 29:34.305
Anyway, uh, Siren, what did
you need?

29:34.337 --> 29:36.807
Nothing really...
want to go on a walk?

29:36.840 --> 29:38.041
Dad?

29:38.976 --> 29:42.514
Sure, take a walk.

29:44.181 --> 29:47.585
After all, you have two legs,
don't you?

29:51.454 --> 29:53.590
It was nice of you to stop by.

29:53.624 --> 29:55.026
Yeah?

29:55.058 --> 29:57.494
Unexpected, but nice.

29:57.528 --> 30:00.096
Yeah, well, I needed someone
to talk to.

30:00.130 --> 30:01.232
What about?

30:02.932 --> 30:04.568
I'm gonna sound like a crazy
person.

30:04.602 --> 30:07.438
You can trust me, Siren,
I won't freak out.

30:07.471 --> 30:09.840
People say things like,
"I won't freak out."

30:09.874 --> 30:13.243
But then once you realize
I really do sound crazy...

30:13.277 --> 30:15.446
you might feel differently.

30:15.479 --> 30:19.217
I won't, I promise. Go crazy.

30:19.250 --> 30:22.186
I'm a mermaid.

30:24.153 --> 30:25.222
Wait.

30:29.926 --> 30:32.329
Are you being serious right now?

30:32.363 --> 30:35.099
Okay, I'm starting to get
the crazy bit.

30:47.577 --> 30:51.281
You know, you were just on two
feet and not in the water, so--

30:51.315 --> 30:54.151
You're not going into the water,
right?

30:54.183 --> 30:56.253
I'm not a mermaid yet.

30:56.287 --> 30:59.590
Okay, I'm actually having a hard
time telling if you're joking.

30:59.623 --> 31:01.625
I'm not joking.

31:01.659 --> 31:05.229
I'm kind of freaking out,
actually.

31:05.261 --> 31:07.597
Just tell me I'm crazy.

31:07.631 --> 31:09.400
I'd prefer if I were crazy.

31:09.432 --> 31:13.170
At least that I can understand.

31:13.202 --> 31:15.240
So you're a mermaid?

31:16.941 --> 31:19.277
Wait, so you're really
a mermaid?

31:22.479 --> 31:25.082
You know, my dad tells me
these stories.

31:25.115 --> 31:26.549
Do you have gills?

31:26.583 --> 31:29.053
Gross! No, I don't have gills.

31:29.086 --> 31:31.588
Okay, relax. I was just asking.

31:31.622 --> 31:33.324
How else do you breathe
underwater?

31:36.059 --> 31:38.096
Want to go for a swim?

31:40.263 --> 31:43.233
What kind of stories
did your dad tell you?

31:43.267 --> 31:45.102
They're a bit dark.

31:45.134 --> 31:46.636
You really know how
to cheer a girl up.

31:46.670 --> 31:48.406
Hey, I'm trying.

31:48.439 --> 31:51.175
If it makes you feel any better,
my dad's a bit of a nut.

31:54.611 --> 31:56.414
Are you okay?

31:56.446 --> 31:58.949
Just checking for scales.

31:58.982 --> 32:02.153
Anyway, I want to show you
something, come on.

32:12.195 --> 32:15.432
What is this place?
Why are we here?

32:15.465 --> 32:18.368
My dad got this storage
when we moved here.

32:18.402 --> 32:20.971
As if our house didn't already
have enough junk in it.

32:21.005 --> 32:22.640
At least he trusts you
with the combo.

32:22.673 --> 32:25.742
My mom holds as much information
from me as possible.

32:25.776 --> 32:27.278
It's actually set to my
birthday...

32:27.310 --> 32:30.013
so I kind of just figured
it out.

32:30.047 --> 32:33.617
My dad would kill me if he found
out I was taking you here.

32:40.790 --> 32:44.294
Wow, what exactly does your dad
do again?

32:44.327 --> 32:48.298
You're kind of looking at it.
He collects stuff.

32:48.332 --> 32:50.034
Nautical stuff.

32:50.067 --> 32:52.103
You know, ocean items to
folklore-type things.

32:52.135 --> 32:53.037
Really?

32:53.070 --> 32:55.172
A lot of things about mermaids
actually.

32:55.204 --> 32:56.573
Is that the reason you
moved here?

32:56.606 --> 32:59.009
To be close to my kind?

32:59.042 --> 33:00.410
I guess.

33:00.443 --> 33:03.213
It's not like we had a long
conversation about it.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.251
Here, check this out.

33:09.452 --> 33:13.523

33:22.799 --> 33:25.702
That's the Wailing Stick.

33:27.304 --> 33:28.639
It's the one from the drawing.

33:28.672 --> 33:30.040
He's got a replica in here
somewhere.

33:30.074 --> 33:32.076
Can I see it?

33:32.108 --> 33:34.011
If I can find it.

33:48.491 --> 33:51.162
It's lighter than I would've
thought.

33:51.194 --> 33:52.730
My dad said the core
is balsa wood...

33:52.762 --> 33:54.798
and the outside is something
called snake wood.

33:54.832 --> 33:56.133
It's supposed to be rare.

33:56.165 --> 33:58.201
It's beautiful.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.406
So are you.

34:02.839 --> 34:07.677
I'm sorry. You're really pretty.
That's what I meant.

34:07.711 --> 34:09.246
New shirt?

34:09.277 --> 34:10.547
New shirt?

34:10.581 --> 34:13.518
Come on, we should go.

34:15.351 --> 34:17.187
The crystal ball on the end.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.657
According to the story, if
a mermaid sticks that side...

34:19.690 --> 34:22.326
in the water, it'll call the
other mermaids to her side.

34:22.358 --> 34:24.694
It acts sort of like a distress
signal.

34:24.728 --> 34:29.099
One side kills, and one side
calls for help?

34:29.132 --> 34:30.533
That sounds dangerous.

34:30.567 --> 34:34.170
It is. That's what makes
it a good story.

34:34.204 --> 34:35.639
It's just a replica, Siren.

34:35.672 --> 34:37.474
Don't worry about it,
it's not real.

34:37.507 --> 34:38.809
Great.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.252
Mom?

34:57.827 --> 34:59.230
Mom, you scared me!

34:59.262 --> 35:01.531
You had me worried sick.

35:03.467 --> 35:05.568
I've also been worried sick...

35:05.601 --> 35:07.804
but about having to live
in the ocean.

35:07.838 --> 35:11.609
You should have told me earlier,
given me time to prepare.

35:12.909 --> 35:17.114
I know. I know that.

35:18.447 --> 35:21.719
I wish you could be
out there with me.

35:21.751 --> 35:24.221
You know what somebody
told me once about parenting?

35:24.253 --> 35:25.822
They said that it's a series
of moments...

35:25.856 --> 35:27.858
where you have to let go.

35:27.891 --> 35:30.827
I just didn't think I had
to let go all at once.

35:30.860 --> 35:34.297
I thought I could just
sort of loosen my grip.

35:34.331 --> 35:37.468
Will Crystal be out there
with me at some point?

35:37.501 --> 35:40.738
In a few months, you're on
different clocks, so to speak.

35:40.771 --> 35:45.576
I wish I could change my clock
to be in sync with hers.

35:45.608 --> 35:48.478
It doesn't really work
like that.

35:48.512 --> 35:51.849
Here, there's something I should
have given you a long time ago.

35:51.882 --> 35:53.550
What is it?

35:53.583 --> 35:54.884
It's an aerator.

35:54.918 --> 35:57.688
It's gonna help you
transition from land to sea.

35:57.721 --> 36:01.592
You need to keep this on you
until you're in the water, okay?

36:01.625 --> 36:03.793
What do I do with it?

36:03.827 --> 36:06.397
When your gills start to come
in, you're going to need to--

36:06.429 --> 36:08.431
Ew. Yuck!

36:08.465 --> 36:12.469
When they come in, you need
to put this on both sides...

36:12.501 --> 36:14.371
of your neck like this, okay?

36:14.403 --> 36:18.442
To cover them, so that
you can breathe.

36:18.474 --> 36:23.947
The transition to mermaid the
first time, it's slow and--

36:23.981 --> 36:25.716
Ugly?

36:27.583 --> 36:30.253
Yeah, sure, I was looking for a
nicer word, but--

36:30.286 --> 36:32.822
There's no nice word for ugly.

36:35.324 --> 36:36.393
I'm gonna miss you.

36:36.425 --> 36:38.362
I'm going to miss you, too.

36:39.829 --> 36:41.865
Have you heard
of the Wailing Stick?

36:45.668 --> 36:47.704
Where did you hear that?

36:47.737 --> 36:49.940
Boy at my school, he had all
these old books...

36:49.972 --> 36:52.710
and his dad had a replica of it
in his storage locker.

36:52.742 --> 36:53.978
What boy?

36:54.010 --> 36:56.480
Just this new kid, Adam Wiltz.

36:56.512 --> 36:58.248
When did he move here?

36:58.282 --> 36:59.550
I don't know.

36:59.583 --> 37:01.251
How many people did he move
here with?

37:01.284 --> 37:02.885
Why can't we just have
a nice moment?

37:02.918 --> 37:04.420
We had a nice moment.

37:04.454 --> 37:07.358
Now I'm asking you some very
important questions.

37:07.391 --> 37:08.692
I don't know, I met his dad...

37:08.724 --> 37:10.728
but he might have an army living
in his basement.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.963
How did you meet his dad?

37:12.996 --> 37:15.699
Don't talk to him ever again!

37:15.731 --> 37:16.934
Fine.

37:16.967 --> 37:19.537
Is that a real fine
or a pretend fine?

37:22.706 --> 37:24.909
Oh my god, okay.

37:26.309 --> 37:28.478
We're gonna talk about this
more in the morning, okay?
