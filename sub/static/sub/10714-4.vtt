20:22.916 --> 20:26.017
And in the process, we
got naked in a hot tub.

20:26.019 --> 20:28.753
We were deemed worthy of a foursome.

20:30.323 --> 20:32.390
We almost did Molly.

20:34.394 --> 20:36.895
And just like that, we're cool again.

20:36.897 --> 20:38.262
Let's go home.

20:38.764 --> 20:40.201
You know what?

20:40.522 --> 20:43.249
I kind of miss that penguin weirdo

20:43.326 --> 20:45.014
and that chick with the purple hair.

20:45.983 --> 20:46.834
Me too.

20:48.693 --> 20:52.123
We, uh, may have to wait until they
stop having sex on our clothes.
