But at the same time,
she doesn't want to expose Leo.

47:31.734 --> 47:34.693
And she knows that Leo
wasn't directly responsible,

47:34.737 --> 47:36.304
but he's involved with this.

47:36.347 --> 47:39.437
It's really, really
a tricky situation for Huck,

47:39.481 --> 47:41.483
and as she's trying
to navigate this,

47:41.526 --> 47:44.051
I think she has no idea
how she's gonna get out of this.

47:44.094 --> 47:45.922
There wasn't
another choice.

47:45.966 --> 47:47.968
Do you actually trust her,
after everything she's done?

47:48.011 --> 47:49.970
Of course I don't.

47:50.013 --> 47:52.711
This argument
that Hope and Iris have --

47:52.755 --> 47:55.932
it's really the most intense
argument we've seen them have,

47:55.976 --> 47:58.630
where they are not
on the same page anymore.

47:58.674 --> 48:00.284
Why is it
you are so willing

48:00.328 --> 48:02.721
to give everyone here
the benefit of the doubt?

48:02.765 --> 48:05.637
Ever since
you got here --
Iris,
that is not fair.

48:05.681 --> 48:07.988
She let an entire city die
and did nothing to stop it.

48:08.031 --> 48:09.554
I'm not saying
that I want to trust her.

48:09.598 --> 48:11.382
For Hope,
she's coming of a place

48:11.426 --> 48:13.689
of "We need to do this, because
dad's life is on the line.

48:13.732 --> 48:15.256
We have no other choice."

48:15.299 --> 48:18.259
But for Iris, she sees Hope
as drinking the Kool-Aid,

48:18.302 --> 48:19.521
and Iris is feeling
in this moment

48:19.564 --> 48:20.826
that she doesn't trust her.

48:20.870 --> 48:22.480
Run.

48:22.524 --> 48:24.700
So when everything
starts to go wrong

48:24.743 --> 48:27.703
and it's like their whole worlds
are closing in on them,

48:27.746 --> 48:30.967
it's really them together
against the CRM.

48:31.011 --> 48:34.840
[Walker growling]

48:34.884 --> 48:36.320
At the end of the day,
they're still sisters,

48:36.364 --> 48:37.800
and they still love each other,

48:37.843 --> 48:39.280
and they'll still have
each other's backs.

48:39.323 --> 48:41.064
So that's really what
that moment is about.

48:41.108 --> 48:43.806
I, uh,
wanted to let you know

48:43.849 --> 48:45.677
I found
the missing vial.

48:45.721 --> 48:47.244
Where'd you find it?

48:47.288 --> 48:48.854
Dr. Bennett stole it.

48:48.898 --> 48:50.726
Leo was stunned

48:50.769 --> 48:54.121
when it appears that she throws
Leo under the bus for a moment.

48:54.164 --> 48:55.992
But what we realize
that she's really doing,

48:56.036 --> 48:58.081
in her eyes, at least,
is saving him.

48:58.125 --> 48:59.691
You can't hurt him.

48:59.735 --> 49:01.955
He's too valuable.
We need him.

49:01.998 --> 49:04.392
He can help
with Project Votus.

49:04.435 --> 49:08.222
And in order to protect himself
and his family and Felix,

49:08.265 --> 49:10.006
he has to go along with it

49:10.050 --> 49:13.357
as much as he wants nothing
to do with this Project Votus,

49:13.401 --> 49:16.839
which has led to the death
of so many people.

49:16.882 --> 49:18.536
With Dr. Bennett's help,
our chances --

49:18.580 --> 49:20.669
Dr. Bennett will not
be helping you, Doctor.

49:20.712 --> 49:23.063
Jennifer,
remove the TS's restraints.

49:24.194 --> 49:26.849
Sorry?Do it, Jennifer.

49:26.892 --> 49:29.504
Negrete: It's ultimately
such poetic justice

49:29.547 --> 49:32.289
for Lyla to be killed by Barca.

49:32.333 --> 49:34.944
We see her kill him
with this gas.

49:34.988 --> 49:37.294
At the end of the day,
that her own experiment

49:37.338 --> 49:39.296
is the thing that kills her.

49:39.340 --> 49:40.906
Please don't do this!

49:40.950 --> 49:42.647
Please! Please!

49:42.691 --> 49:44.998
[Screaming]

49:45.041 --> 49:48.436
"The rat
will eventually get tired,

49:48.479 --> 49:50.873
but the dead won't."

49:50.916 --> 49:52.962
Couldn't have put it
better myself.

49:53.006 --> 49:55.225
Negrete: We imply
that Jadis somehow heard.

49:55.269 --> 49:57.967
Maybe there are recordings
in that lab we don't know.

49:58.011 --> 49:59.360
So it really is everything

49:59.403 --> 50:01.492
coming full circle
in that moment.

50:01.536 --> 50:05.018
Please help me!
Please help me!

50:05.061 --> 50:07.194
[Screaming]

50:07.237 --> 50:09.935
That bloody hand
against the glass --

50:09.979 --> 50:12.895
it's such an iconic
just horror-movie staple.

50:12.938 --> 50:14.375
You know,
for a show that, you know,

50:14.418 --> 50:15.854
felt a little lighter
last season,

50:15.898 --> 50:17.465
It's an indication
that we're going

50:17.508 --> 50:19.206
towards a much darker place

50:19.249 --> 50:21.425
as we get into
these final episodes.

50:21.469 --> 50:24.950
Another tragic accident,
but these things happen.
