00:06.607 --> 00:08.679
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, BOB?

00:08.679 --> 00:10.241
CHARLIE'S FIRST
BIG-GIRL BED.

00:10.241 --> 00:12.213
SHE'S NOT
A BABY ANYMORE.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.714
CHARLIE, DO YOU LIKE
YOUR NEW BED?

00:13.714 --> 00:15.116
NO.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.090
OH, IT SEEMS LIKE
JUST YESTERDAY

00:19.090 --> 00:20.591
I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT
GIVING UP THIS ROOM.

00:20.591 --> 00:22.653
AW, YOU MISS
YOUR OLD ROOM, HONEY?

00:22.653 --> 00:25.056
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THERE'S TWO FLOORS

00:25.056 --> 00:27.458
BETWEEN ME AND THE BOYS NOW.
THIS ROOM IS DEAD TO ME.

00:27.458 --> 00:30.601
HEY, NOW THAT CHARLIE'S
GOT HER OWN BED,

00:30.601 --> 00:32.163
I CAN HAVE
A SLEEPOVER, RIGHT?

00:32.163 --> 00:34.305
OKAY, HOW DID
CHARLIE'S NEW BED

00:34.305 --> 00:35.766
TURN INTO YOU
GETTING A SLEEPOVER?

00:35.766 --> 00:37.708
LET ME WALK
YOU THROUGH IT.

00:37.708 --> 00:41.272
OH, I LOVE IT WHEN
HE WALKS US THROUGH STUFF.

00:41.272 --> 00:44.775
EVERY TIME I ASK
YOU GUYS FOR A SLEEPOVER,

00:44.775 --> 00:47.678
YOU TELL ME I CAN'T
BECAUSE THERE'S A BABY
IN THE HOUSE.

00:47.678 --> 00:49.650
WELL, DAD JUST SAID
SHE'S NOT A BABY ANYMORE.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.722
AND HE WALKED US
THROUGH IT

00:51.722 --> 00:54.185
AND IT'S MY FAULT.

00:54.185 --> 00:56.627
LOOK. IF I DON'T HAVE
A SLEEPOVER SOON,

00:56.627 --> 00:58.589
THE OTHER KIDS WILL STOP
INVITING ME TO THEIRS.

00:58.589 --> 01:00.291
ONE NIGHT OF KIDS
AT OUR HOUSE

01:00.291 --> 01:02.633
AND WE GET RID OF GABE
FOR A BUNCH OF NIGHTS.

01:02.633 --> 01:05.596
TAKE IT.
IT'S A GOOD DEAL.

01:05.596 --> 01:07.568
- FINE, YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR SLEEPOVER.

01:10.701 --> 01:13.274
COME HERE, CHARLIE.
LET'S LOOK AT
YOUR NEW BED.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.746

THAT WAS ASTHMA.E END,

03:01.752 --> 03:03.484

03:05.185 --> 03:06.757
SO I REALLY WANT IT
TO GO WELL.

03:06.757 --> 03:09.260

03:12.323 --> 03:14.194
THE DIRECTOR SEES ME
DO THIS...

03:16.297 --> 03:18.499
AND WHEN THE OTHER KIDS
ARE AUDITIONING,

03:18.499 --> 03:20.301
I'LL DO THIS...

03:22.303 --> 03:25.706
WOW. ALICE, YOU MAKE
A REALLY GOOD STINK FACE.

03:25.706 --> 03:29.209
- WE LIVE NEXT TO
A SEWAGE-TREATMENT PLANT.
-( footsteps )

03:29.209 --> 03:31.342
- HEY.

03:31.342 --> 03:33.244
- WHAT YOU GO THERE?
- A CUPFUL OF BACON.

03:34.845 --> 03:37.618
DUDE, IF YOU DON'T
START EATING HEALTHIER,

03:37.618 --> 03:39.390
YOU'RE GONNA GET FAT.

03:39.390 --> 03:41.422
TEDDY, I CAN EAT
WHATEVER I WANT.

03:41.422 --> 03:45.456
NOTHING HAPPENS.
NOW IF YOU'RE THROUGH HERE,

03:45.456 --> 03:48.429
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A NAP.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.461

UPSTAIRS TO YOUR ROOM?

03:50.461 --> 03:52.232

A LITTLE WOOZY.

BOTHERING YOU, AM I?

04:04.545 --> 04:06.246

04:07.978 --> 04:10.651
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT MY SLEEPOVER
FOR A SECOND?

04:12.683 --> 04:15.326
GABE, YOU'RE DISTRACTING ME
FROM MY HOUSEWORK.

04:15.326 --> 04:18.028
OF COURSE WE CAN TALK
ABOUT YOUR SLEEPOVER.

04:18.028 --> 04:19.860
OKAY, FIRST QUESTION:

04:19.860 --> 04:21.832
WHAT ARE YOU
SERVING US FOR DINNER?

04:21.832 --> 04:24.335
WELL, I WAS
THINKING OF MAKING
MY FAMOUS MEATLOAF

04:24.335 --> 04:25.896
WITH A NICE SIDE SALAD.

04:25.896 --> 04:27.998
PIZZA IT IS.

04:27.998 --> 04:31.502
OKAY, NOW I'M GONNA NEED YOU

05:02.072 --> 05:04.535
P.J., BREAKFAST!

05:04.535 --> 05:06.637

05:14.685 --> 05:16.417
I'M STARVING.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.489

05:19.690 --> 05:21.622
ARE YOU STUCK AGAIN?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.954

06:07.398 --> 06:08.739
ONE MUST PRESENT
ONESELF WITH CONFIDENCE,

07:13.464 --> 07:15.205
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE SUGAR AT HOME.

07:17.708 --> 07:19.870
I-- HUH--
WONDER WHY.

07:19.870 --> 07:23.544
YEAH. MAYBE WE SHOULD
SWITCH YOU TO WATER.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.484
10 MINUTES.
PACE YOURSELF.

07:34.725 --> 07:36.957
DOES THIS PIZZA HAVE
CHEESE ON IT?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.730
- 'CAUSE I CAN'T
EAT CHEESE.
- I'LL EAT IT.

07:42.032 --> 07:44.234
LIAM, WOULD YOU LIKE
A PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH?

07:44.234 --> 07:47.237

07:49.239 --> 07:51.502
WHAT MOVIE ARE

07:51.502 --> 07:54.474
WELL, I WAS THINKING

07:54.474 --> 07:57.578
"MONKEYS GO BANANAS."

07:59.479 --> 08:01.211
IT'S A DELIGHTFUL
AND FUNNY CARTOON

08:01.211 --> 08:03.954
ABOUT MONKEYS
WHO JUST GO BANANAS.

08:03.954 --> 08:06.116
THAT'S FOR SIX-YEAR-OLDS.

08:06.116 --> 08:08.519
NO, IT SAYS
"FOUR AND UP."

08:08.519 --> 08:10.621
( chuckles )
EXCUSE ME.

08:10.621 --> 08:12.563
MOM, CAN I TALK

08:16.196 --> 08:18.699
( whispers )
YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE!

08:18.699 --> 08:22.973
WHERE'S THE MOVIE
I ASKED YOU TO GET,
"ZOMBIE BLOOD PARTY"?

08:22.973 --> 08:25.275
WELL, I GOT IT,
BUT I'M JUST NOT SURE.

08:25.275 --> 08:26.977
GABE, IT LOOKS
VERY VIOLENT.

08:26.977 --> 08:30.040
THAT'S KIND OF
THE POINT.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.912
NOW GET OVER THERE
AND SELL IT!

08:31.912 --> 08:34.044
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

08:37.287 --> 08:39.820
OUR OTHER CHOICE IS

08:39.820 --> 08:41.822

08:50.831 --> 08:53.904
OKAY, GUYS.
WE'VE GOT THE TENT
SET UP IN THE BACKYARD

08:53.904 --> 08:55.606
SO ONCE
WE'RE DONE EATING--

08:55.606 --> 08:57.568
I GUESS THEY'RE
DONE EATING.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.319
HE MIGHT WANT
A DESSERT MENU.

09:14.024 --> 09:15.786
- WHAT YOU DOING?
- WORKING OUT

09:15.786 --> 09:18.258
SO I DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO SCHOOL IN A HELICOPTER.

09:19.690 --> 09:22.332
AS USUAL,
I ONLY UNDERSTOOD HALF.

09:23.934 --> 09:26.196
- HEY, P.J.,
WAIT WAIT WAIT.
- WHAT?

09:26.196 --> 09:28.098
YOU'VE GOT TO STRETCH OUT
BEFORE YOU PUMP THE IRON.

09:28.098 --> 09:29.299
YOU WANT
TO HURT YOURSELF?

09:29.299 --> 09:32.342
- NO.
- HEY, COME HERE. COME HERE.

09:32.342 --> 09:34.104

ONE AND--

09:40.651 --> 09:42.282

09:42.282 --> 09:44.184
Both:
OW! OW! OW!

09:44.184 --> 09:46.586
NO! NO! NO! NO!

09:46.586 --> 09:49.660

I PULLED A HAMSTRING.

09:49.660 --> 09:50.891
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DO--

09:50.891 --> 09:52.893
OH! DAD BUTT! OW!

ALL NIGHT.

10:02.372 --> 10:04.635
- I KNOW I AM.
- YEAH.

10:06.136 --> 10:08.378
THIS GROUND SEEMS
KIND OF HARD.

10:08.378 --> 10:10.711
LIAM, IT'S THE GROUND.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.983
THAT'S HOW THE GROUND
ALWAYS FEELS.

10:12.983 --> 10:16.747
HEY, ZIP UP THE DOOR
SO NO ONE ELSE CAN GET IN.

10:21.692 --> 10:24.755
WAIT. WE'RE STILL
GONNA BE ABLE TO GET
MORE FOOD, RIGHT?

10:27.227 --> 10:30.701
WELL, IT'S OFFICIAL.
CHARLIE HATES HER NEW BED.

10:30.701 --> 10:33.003
( chuckles )
NOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH HER?

10:33.003 --> 10:35.365
WRITING ON WALLS.
WON'T SLEEP IN HER BED.

10:35.365 --> 10:38.108
WELL, BOB,
SHE'S AN OVERACHIEVER.

10:38.108 --> 10:40.711
SHE STARTED
HER TERRIBLE TWOS
AT ONE AND A HALF.

10:40.711 --> 10:43.944
( chuckles )
BRING HER OVER HERE.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.716

10:50.751 --> 10:52.282
IT'S OKAY. IT'S BETTER.
IT'S ALL BETTER NOW.

10:52.282 --> 10:55.085
- YOU REALLY HURT YOURSELF, HUH?
- YEAH, WELL,

10:55.085 --> 10:57.257
THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR TRYING TO EXERCISE.

10:57.257 --> 11:00.190
BOY, I'M GLAD
THAT CHAPTER'S CLOSED.

11:00.190 --> 11:03.063
-( boys screaming )
- WHOA, WHAT'S THAT?

11:03.063 --> 11:04.765
OH, DID YOU TURN OFF
THE AUTOMATIC SPRINKLERS?

11:04.765 --> 11:06.396
WE HAVE
AUTOMATIC SPRINKLERS?

11:07.998 --> 11:09.870

11:21.952 --> 11:24.885
IT WAS LIKE BEING TRAPPED
IN A WASHING MACHINE.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.286
I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA DROWN.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.459
THE WHOLE NIGHT
IS RUINED.

11:29.459 --> 11:31.261
RELAX.
WE CAN FIX THIS.

11:31.261 --> 11:34.124
HOW? WE WERE GONNA
SLEEP IN THE TENT,

11:34.124 --> 11:35.896
WATCH A MOVIE
IN THE TENT,

11:35.896 --> 11:38.999
DO STUFF I COULDN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT IN THE TENT.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.902
HEY, GABE, LOOK.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO UPSTAIRS,

11:41.902 --> 11:44.374
HAVE A SLEEPOVER
IN YOUR ROOM AND THEN P.J.--

11:44.374 --> 11:46.106
P.J. CAN SLEEP
ON THE COUCH IN THE BASEMENT.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.939
YEAH YEAH,
AND I'LL ORDER
ANOTHER PIZZA.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.916
TELL THEM TO PUT MORE
PEPPERONI ON THIS TIME.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.147
I COULD STILL
SEE CHEESE.

12:02.452 --> 12:04.995
UH, LIAM HONEY,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

12:04.995 --> 12:06.957
I'M AFRAID
OF UPSTAIRS.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.731
- EXCUSE ME?
- WE LIVE IN A ONE-STORY HOUSE.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.234
I'VE NEVER BEEN UPSTAIRS
AND I'M NOT GONNA START NOW.

12:19.910 --> 12:22.773

12:22.773 --> 12:25.245
OKAY, SLEEPOVER'S
IN THE BASEMENT.

YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
OF DOWNSTAIRS, ARE YOU?

EVENTUALLY HAVE TO--

THEY COULD SLEEP DOWNSTAIRS?

WELL, BEAUTY OF COURSE.
WHY WOULD I BE AUDITIONING
FOR THE BEAST?

I like myself just
