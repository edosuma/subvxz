On the 5th, the 1st boat to open
the course to Mount Kumgang...

00:19.100 --> 00:20.200
was Bongraeho.

00:20.930 --> 00:23.370
Hyundai decided to put 800 passengers...

00:23.370 --> 00:25.170
who reserved a trip...

00:25.440 --> 00:28.370
to Mount Kumgang that had been
postponed on Bongraeho.

00:28.770 --> 00:32.710
Well, I can't say that for sure. But I...

00:33.080 --> 00:35.250
They murdered and dismembered
a member of their gang.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.350
And they also ate up the intestines.
This shocking and bizarre murder...

00:38.350 --> 00:39.650
shocked the public.

00:39.650 --> 00:41.390
Reporter Kim Sang Gi from
Daejeon Broadcasting will continue.

00:42.550 --> 00:45.860
Six members of the so-called Hero Gang...

(Visitation Request Form,
Name: Yang Yong Chul)

01:28.870 --> 01:33.070
(Visitation Request Counter)

01:34.640 --> 01:35.810
Okay.

01:41.610 --> 01:42.750
Inmate 3585.

01:44.580 --> 01:46.180
He refused the visitation request.

01:48.950 --> 01:50.790
Have a good day.
Thanks.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.860
Inmate 3585.
He refused the visitation request.

02:02.170 --> 02:05.740
Inmate 3585.
He refused the visitation request.

02:07.940 --> 02:11.340
Inmate 3585.
He refused the visitation request.

02:18.750 --> 02:22.720
Detective, why don't you put
some money under his name next time?

02:22.920 --> 02:24.050
Come on.

02:50.450 --> 02:52.220
(Keep quiet)

02:59.520 --> 03:00.690
What's this about?

03:03.330 --> 03:06.200
You don't even know who I am.
Why did you refuse to see me?

03:06.200 --> 03:09.370
Well, I don't have anyone
who would visit me.

03:09.930 --> 03:13.500
And whenever someone came to see me,
it was never good news.

03:15.110 --> 03:17.340
Why did you think he wasn't the culprit?

03:21.410 --> 03:23.180
He's not the culprit.

03:27.020 --> 03:30.490
I see. You have a good memory, Detective.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.090
But you kept coming here
because of what I said?

03:38.230 --> 03:39.500
That's odd.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.600
I want to know...

03:41.930 --> 03:43.870
why you thought he wasn't the culprit.

03:43.870 --> 03:45.340
Why do you want to know?

03:45.340 --> 03:46.470
You won't tell me?

03:46.470 --> 03:48.240
Why should I tell you that?

03:48.240 --> 03:49.540
You don't need money?

03:51.680 --> 03:52.840
Well,

03:53.780 --> 03:55.980
I can tell just by looking at their eyes.

03:55.980 --> 03:57.510
Here's a thing about hunches.

03:57.610 --> 04:00.880
Detectives aren't the only ones
who have them.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.860
He stripped the girl naked.

04:08.690 --> 04:10.390
And he killed her
in the heat of the moment.

04:10.860 --> 04:14.360
If he did it in the heat
of the moment, why strip her naked?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.940
And she was his girlfriend.

04:22.170 --> 04:25.880
Right? Allegedly, he killed her
in the heat of the moment.

04:25.880 --> 04:30.150
Well, they must have been in love. Right?

04:30.150 --> 04:32.920
Even if he killed her, it was a mistake.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.520
Or an accident?

04:35.520 --> 04:37.320
Okay. Let's call it an accident.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.390
Then he would have dressed her
if she was naked.

04:39.390 --> 04:41.560
That's what a normal guy would do.

04:41.590 --> 04:45.960
People who have killed someone before
would strip their victims naked.

04:46.330 --> 04:47.660
That's my point.

04:52.670 --> 04:55.510
You know what habits are, right?

04:55.770 --> 04:57.610
Old habits die hard.

04:58.070 --> 05:01.440
And you end up doing these habits
before you realize it.

05:02.950 --> 05:04.750
What does that have to do with this case?

05:07.180 --> 05:09.720
When I was a kid,
my father always beat me up...

05:09.720 --> 05:12.960
during our meals.
Do you know why he beat me up?

05:13.390 --> 05:17.360
Because I always left a spoonful
of rice instead of finishing it.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.100
It's odd. I just didn't want
to eat the last spoonful of rice.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.870
Eating the last spoonful made me feel...

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
like I was losing my spirit.

05:30.570 --> 05:32.610
Well, I digress.

05:32.610 --> 05:35.550
Anyway, he beat me up for leaving
rice because it'd be bad luck.

05:35.550 --> 05:37.250
But I still can't eat the last spoonful.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.680
I don't have anyone...

05:39.680 --> 05:41.890
who would beat me
for leaving the last spoonful now.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.890
Let me sum it up.

05:44.990 --> 05:47.360
No matter how meticulously
you plan something,

05:47.360 --> 05:51.490
your habits come out like second nature.

05:52.130 --> 05:53.560
That's my point.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.440
I'm sure there was a reason
behind stripping her.

05:58.440 --> 06:02.110
He had to strip her to get off.
And whoever did that...

06:02.670 --> 06:04.740
is the real culprit.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.110
Just like no matter how badly
my father beat me up,

06:10.310 --> 06:15.220
I had to leave the last spoonful
of rice for me to be satisfied.

06:18.860 --> 06:20.390
I bet I'm right about this.

06:21.260 --> 06:24.590
Detective Song Ha Young.

06:29.770 --> 06:31.840
Gosh. Again?

06:31.840 --> 06:33.140
His MO is bothering me.

06:33.140 --> 06:36.210
I'm sure it's related to
Won Mal Sook's case in Uyeong-dong.

06:36.210 --> 06:37.740
What MO?

06:37.740 --> 06:39.310
It's the way she was killed.

06:39.310 --> 06:42.380
She was also found naked
without any signs of sexual assault.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.710
He's doing that to humiliate the victims.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.880
The case is closed. Stop causing trouble.

06:47.150 --> 06:49.490
It's not advice. I'm warning you.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.730
Hey. Answer me.

06:57.430 --> 06:59.160
Don't do anything.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.930
I warned you!

07:01.560 --> 07:02.730
Hey! Darn it.

07:20.950 --> 07:25.460
(Won Mal Sook's residence)

07:48.450 --> 07:50.050
Signs of forced entry.

07:50.950 --> 07:52.320
But no numbers.

08:42.370 --> 08:46.200
(Service, Order)

08:46.200 --> 08:49.040
Here, this is for you.
Thank you.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.790
My gosh, you must have a sweet tooth.

09:04.220 --> 09:05.220
Yes.

09:05.220 --> 09:07.760
All the detectives
at Dongbu Police Station are busy,

09:07.760 --> 09:10.090
so we thoroughly investigated
the case, but...

09:10.090 --> 09:11.900
I bet you couldn't catch that petty thief.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.460
Like you suggested last time,

09:14.500 --> 09:17.300
we interviewed all the delivery guys
who work in the area...

09:17.470 --> 09:19.300
but couldn't track him down.

09:19.740 --> 09:21.370
I suppose that made him
feel alarmed though.

09:21.370 --> 09:22.840
It's been quiet since then.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.940
We've further enhanced patrols
in the area.

09:26.180 --> 09:27.780
Was there anyone who seemed suspicious?

09:28.140 --> 09:30.910
There was a kid
who looked quite suspicious.

09:31.410 --> 09:33.350
He's just a punk who bullies
other kids in the area...

09:33.350 --> 09:35.320
and extorts chump change from them.

09:35.690 --> 09:37.290
We brought him in to interview him...

09:37.290 --> 09:38.790
and checked his alibi too.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.820
The thing is, he always wore a red cap.

09:43.330 --> 09:44.760
The Red Cap has been caught.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.460
That I know, but we all thought
he seemed suspicious,

09:47.460 --> 09:49.130
so we brought him in and questioned him.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.130
I heard the man
the lady at the store saw...

09:51.130 --> 09:52.870
was wearing a red cap.

09:53.140 --> 09:54.900
Witness statements are confidential.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.810
I'm a regular at the store,

09:56.810 --> 09:58.210
so that lady and I are quite close.

09:58.370 --> 09:59.980
She was scared because she saw him,

09:59.980 --> 10:01.840
so she asked me
to keep an eye on her store,

10:01.910 --> 10:04.010
which was why I made sure
to patrol the area more often.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.350
I found that cap.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.390
It's true. Believe me.

10:15.790 --> 10:17.230
Is it common for youngsters your age...

10:17.390 --> 10:20.030
to use things that others threw out?

10:20.460 --> 10:22.030
It was from a designer brand.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.530
Can I see it?
I threw it out.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.640
You did?
Darn it.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.940
I had to go to the police station
because of it.

10:29.940 --> 10:31.610
I said it wasn't mine,
but no one believed me.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.780
How tall are you?
Me?

10:34.880 --> 10:36.080
I'm 183cm tall.

10:36.980 --> 10:39.180
Anyway, he was short enough to be a girl.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.880
I can go now, right?
Wait.

10:42.820 --> 10:45.050
The houses in the area have numbers
like this by the entrance.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.320
Do you know what this means?

10:49.660 --> 10:51.090
Isn't it the street address?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.770
How would I know?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.770
This is so annoying.

11:08.310 --> 11:09.450
Captain.

11:09.910 --> 11:12.580
About the Uyeong-dong case,
Won Mal Sook's prints...

11:12.580 --> 11:13.920
were the only thing they found.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.590
(Fingerprint Analysis Report)

11:17.320 --> 11:19.790
(Won Mal Sook,
Fingerprint Analysis Results)

11:19.790 --> 11:21.260
Who is this jerk?

11:22.590 --> 11:24.130
His MO is bothering me.

11:24.130 --> 11:27.230
I'm sure it's related to
Won Mal Sook's case in Uyeong-dong.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.010
Hand it over at once.

11:49.390 --> 11:50.550
Thanks, guys.

11:52.090 --> 11:54.860
Catching the culprit
doesn't mean it's over.

11:54.860 --> 11:57.290
What? Our job's done
the moment we lock them up.

11:57.290 --> 11:58.730
What more do we have to do?

11:58.730 --> 12:01.560
We should record everything
these criminals said and did...

12:01.560 --> 12:03.570
so we can help prevent
future crimes and...

12:04.930 --> 12:07.040
You always have to make everything
sound so important.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.640
No! My goodness.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.110
Whatever.

12:10.110 --> 12:12.440
Hey, those case files too.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.980
You requested them for no reason.
They're just sitting on your desk.

12:14.980 --> 12:17.280
Because of you, everyone from
the 31 police stations in Seoul...

12:17.280 --> 12:19.950
cursed me and Superintendent Baek
like there was no tomorrow.

12:19.950 --> 12:22.090
I'm telling you. It'll be useful one day.

12:22.090 --> 12:23.590
When? How?

12:23.590 --> 12:25.390
Gosh, why are you so negative?

12:25.390 --> 12:29.160
Come on. It helped us organize
all the files on serious crimes.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.930
It wasn't so bad.

12:30.930 --> 12:33.560
I guess you're
a glass-half-full kind of person.

12:33.560 --> 12:37.230
By the way, we detectives are satisfied...

12:37.230 --> 12:39.900
when we can run around
and cuff criminals...

12:39.900 --> 12:41.740
with our own hands.

12:41.870 --> 12:44.940
That profiler or whatever
it's called. Are you sure...

12:44.940 --> 12:46.440
that person is on board?

12:46.440 --> 12:49.410
Don't you worry about that.
Just create the department.

12:49.410 --> 12:50.780
Well...

12:50.910 --> 12:53.650
That's not something I can decide.

12:53.650 --> 12:55.490
Yes, you can.
Goodness.

12:55.490 --> 12:57.050
Give us this new department.

12:57.050 --> 12:59.790
Excuse me. Could you give us
more radish kimchi?

12:59.790 --> 13:00.920
Goodness.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.300
(Family Visitation Room)

13:15.100 --> 13:17.110
I suppose what I told you wasn't useless.

13:19.580 --> 13:20.910
Did something else happen?

13:22.380 --> 13:23.610
What floor?

13:26.050 --> 13:28.920
The ground floor. But I believe
he's targeting other houses too.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.320
Some of them are on the second floor.

13:30.350 --> 13:32.020
I guess he's skilled at picking locks...

13:32.020 --> 13:33.320
and jumping over walls.

13:34.490 --> 13:37.090
You see, home is the safest place.

13:37.630 --> 13:39.160
No one else can see what you do,

13:39.230 --> 13:41.260
except for you and the victim.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.030
But there were no signs of sexual assault.

13:44.030 --> 13:47.070
Gosh. The victims were found naked.
Obviously, he's a pervert.

13:47.070 --> 13:48.100
Is that not sexual assault?

13:48.100 --> 13:51.770
And that's why you came to see me.
Am I wrong?

13:51.770 --> 13:53.240
Hey, look.

13:53.780 --> 13:56.880
I got caught because I dragged her
to the parking lot.

13:57.180 --> 13:59.950
It's not something I usually do.
I only did it because I got horny.

14:01.620 --> 14:03.120
Oh, boy.

14:03.850 --> 14:07.190
This is why you should always
plan everything and stick to it.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.490
You know?

14:08.660 --> 14:11.730
Then why did you deviate from your plan?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.800
Because I was confident
that I wouldn't be caught.

14:23.510 --> 14:26.680
Then should I look for ex-cons
in the area first?

14:27.880 --> 14:29.510
Well, that's an idea.

14:32.220 --> 14:33.780
What? You're leaving already?

14:35.890 --> 14:40.020
I'm telling you.
This guy is sick in the head.

14:40.220 --> 14:42.230
He's obsessed with undressing his victims.

14:45.660 --> 14:46.800
Detective.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.800
Will you visit me again?

14:52.900 --> 14:54.040
You know,

14:54.940 --> 14:56.670
I'm an orphan,

14:57.010 --> 14:59.310
so no one ever sent me
a commissary deposit.

14:59.580 --> 15:01.480
But now that I got a little taste of it...

15:02.650 --> 15:04.080
I must say, it's very nice.

15:06.050 --> 15:07.180
Oh, boy.

15:07.850 --> 15:09.150
An orphan?

15:10.250 --> 15:12.290
You went on about how your father...

15:13.360 --> 15:14.920
always scolded you at mealtimes.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.030
Goodness.

15:16.460 --> 15:19.230
I only call him like that because
I don't know what else to call him.

15:19.230 --> 15:21.200
He does not deserve to be called a father.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.700
He sent his own child to an orphanage.

That's nuts.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.390
Okay.

15:48.720 --> 15:49.830
Hey.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.330
Goodness.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.430
I heard you visited Yang Yong Chul again
and even deposited cash...

15:58.430 --> 16:00.300
into his commissary account.

16:01.470 --> 16:05.370
What an embarrassment. I'm humiliated.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.610
Criminals understand each other better.

16:08.610 --> 16:09.710
What?

16:10.010 --> 16:11.680
Hey, kiddo. What's he saying now?

16:15.220 --> 16:17.750
I clearly warned you not to cause trouble.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.890
Apparently,

16:20.890 --> 16:24.160
Yang Yong Chul is going on about it,
all excited.

16:24.260 --> 16:26.100
That a police detective...

16:26.260 --> 16:31.500
That some stupid detective
keeps visiting him...

16:31.730 --> 16:34.300
and asking him for advice!

16:35.610 --> 16:37.510
The things that
Yang Yong Chul is saying...

16:38.770 --> 16:40.040
It makes sense.

16:40.340 --> 16:41.980
You've clearly lost your mind.

16:42.610 --> 16:43.780
Fine.

16:43.910 --> 16:45.410
Criminals understand each other better.

16:45.410 --> 16:47.080
So what?
We should catch him.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.750
Who?
The real culprit.

16:54.220 --> 16:55.490
Are you doing this...

16:56.730 --> 16:59.230
to rebel against me? Is that it?

17:01.260 --> 17:02.600
What do you mean, sir?

17:02.670 --> 17:04.900
I caught the culprit
and put him behind bars.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.240
But you're digging it up again,
insisting he's not the real culprit.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.869
Talk about being disrespectful.
No, don't get me wrong.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.780
I'm just trying to tell you
that it's related to this case.

17:12.780 --> 17:16.109
What will you do if Yang Yong Chul
starts running his mouth,

17:16.109 --> 17:17.380
talking nonsense?

17:17.380 --> 17:18.780
You'll ruin the police's reputation.

17:18.780 --> 17:20.280
But that's secondary.

17:20.280 --> 17:23.119
What will you do
if the higher-ups hear about it?

17:23.119 --> 17:25.520
Who will take responsibility for it?

17:27.190 --> 17:28.420
I will.

17:33.230 --> 17:34.430
Who do you think you are?

17:34.800 --> 17:37.070
Who do you think you are
to take the responsibility?

17:38.730 --> 17:41.300
If you were big enough
to take the responsibility,

17:41.300 --> 17:42.610
then why were you sent here?

17:42.610 --> 17:45.040
If the real culprit is somebody else,

17:45.740 --> 17:47.610
who'll take responsibility
for Bang Ki Hoon's life?

17:47.610 --> 17:50.050
You little rascal. I'll get you.

17:55.620 --> 17:56.850
Hey, you should...

17:57.850 --> 17:59.190
just be the culprit.

17:59.890 --> 18:01.720
You said, criminals
understand each other better.

18:02.060 --> 18:04.490
You can become a culprit yourself.

18:05.230 --> 18:09.300
I'll arrest you, break your neck,
and throw you in prison.

18:09.730 --> 18:12.670
The culprit for Bang Ki Hoon
and Won Mal Sook's case is the same.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.870
He couldn't lose the habit
of leaving the victim naked.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.170
And he's become even bolder.

18:19.410 --> 18:21.110
He won't stop here.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.980
You weren't listening
to anything I said, did you?

18:28.220 --> 18:30.020
I'll catch that culprit.

18:31.550 --> 18:35.890
(Do Not Enter, Under Investigation)

18:50.910 --> 18:52.480

18:54.510 --> 18:55.910
History of robbery.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.410
But he doesn't show up in the system.

18:59.020 --> 19:01.880
The MO looks the same,
but this one didn't have a sign.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.250
Has he become bolder?

19:03.950 --> 19:05.920
Or was this really done by someone else?

19:06.620 --> 19:08.760
(List of Ex-convicts
for Robbery and Rape in Seoul)

19:20.570 --> 19:22.840
I narrowed down the suspects
for Won Mal Sook's case.

19:23.270 --> 19:24.370
What's this?

19:24.370 --> 19:26.010
Ex-convicts who are good at housebreaking.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.280
Do you remember
the scratches on the keyhole...

19:28.280 --> 19:29.850
found at Choi Hwa Yeon's place?

19:30.080 --> 19:32.180
Yes.
It's from opening it by force.

19:32.180 --> 19:33.450
Look. It was found again.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.920
But this is a common technique.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.120
I'll narrow them down to those
who have worked as a deliveryman.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.620
Deliveryman?

19:41.320 --> 19:43.160
Over half of the houses
including the one with the theft...

19:43.160 --> 19:45.230
were marked like this. Look.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.130
See?

19:48.600 --> 19:49.800
It had to be him.

19:50.170 --> 19:51.270
A deliveryman.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.270
Bang Ki Hoon's case, 214 Daebong-dong.

19:53.270 --> 19:55.500
Recent case, 712 Uyeong-dong.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.810
They aren't too far apart.

19:56.810 --> 19:59.140
I'll use the two areas as my anchor
to narrow down the residence...

19:59.140 --> 20:00.440
and find the suspect.

20:11.020 --> 20:13.260
(List of Ex-convicts

20:14.590 --> 20:15.960
(43-1 Uyeong-dong)

20:20.130 --> 20:21.330
Darn it.

20:23.830 --> 20:24.970
Who is it?

20:26.540 --> 20:27.840
Who the heck are you?

20:29.170 --> 20:31.440
Detective Song Ha Young of SCU,
Dongbu Police Station.

20:32.410 --> 20:34.440
What do you want?
I didn't commit any crimes.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.980
I just need to confirm your alibi.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.650
I just need to ask a few...
You randomly come...

20:38.650 --> 20:40.350
and treat
a perfectly innocent guy like me...

20:40.350 --> 20:42.820
like a criminal, when all I am
trying to do is live a good life.

20:46.690 --> 20:49.630
Goodness, why are you so angry?

20:49.790 --> 20:51.790
I just need to ask a few...
Darn you.

21:03.570 --> 21:06.340
Go away. I don't know.

21:06.340 --> 21:08.110
Why is the police hassling me?

21:08.110 --> 21:09.750
I just need to confirm your alibi.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.580
I said I have no idea.

21:13.950 --> 21:15.950
Where were you
on the night of the 30 last month?

21:15.990 --> 21:18.050
On Monday, my landlord said...

21:18.050 --> 21:20.620
the drain is clogged,
so I helped her unclog it.

21:21.190 --> 21:22.290
Thanks.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.760
Hello, we're from Dongbu Police Station.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.160
We would have his fingerprint
in the system...

21:53.260 --> 21:54.660
if the culprit was an ex-convict...

21:56.230 --> 21:57.490
but it doesn't show up.

22:01.430 --> 22:04.070
You expect me to give it to you
for those few pennies you gave me?

22:04.530 --> 22:06.840
Detective, you love freebies
a little too much.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.940
If you're curious, you must pay the price.

22:11.340 --> 22:15.240
Nothing is free in this world, is it?

22:15.480 --> 22:18.680
I heard you visited Yang Yong Chul again
and even deposited cash...

22:18.680 --> 22:20.650
into his commissary account.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.120
Don't get cheeky.

22:22.890 --> 22:24.320
I'm not acting cheeky.

22:25.620 --> 22:26.720
Look at me.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.490
I ended up in here
trying to get some freebies.

22:32.530 --> 22:35.100
Man, you make me sad.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.000
Then you should go.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.270
That some stupid detective...

22:39.270 --> 22:42.000
keeps visiting him...

22:42.140 --> 22:45.010
and asking him for advice!

22:48.210 --> 22:49.380
Yang Yong Chul.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.150
That's enough.

22:57.120 --> 23:00.420
All I did was give an answer
to your question. Right?

23:00.860 --> 23:02.320
Only someone like
I would give you an answer.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.790
If it had been other punks,
they would never say a word.

23:05.860 --> 23:08.660
It'll expose all their methods.
They'd be insane to answer you.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.830
Man, fine.

23:11.830 --> 23:14.870
You must've grown on me
in that short while. What's with me?

23:16.470 --> 23:18.440
Family Visitation Room.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.180
My heart feels soft
because I keep seeing you here...

23:24.180 --> 23:26.750
Hey, you're very scary.

23:30.350 --> 23:31.990
This is my final warning.

23:32.090 --> 23:33.220
Do not step over the line.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.390
You really don't know how I feel, do you?

23:39.330 --> 23:40.760
This is for sure.

23:41.200 --> 23:45.700
Once he gets a taste of this,
he'll never be able to quit.

23:46.670 --> 23:50.140
If you don't catch him, yes.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.040
It'll happen again.

(Eradicate petty thugs
that eat away our economy)

24:00.220 --> 24:03.220
You little punk! How dare you do this?

24:03.220 --> 24:06.320
You broke into my home
in the broad daylight!

24:06.820 --> 24:08.020
Darn it.

24:08.290 --> 24:12.160
So your girlfriend was asleep,

24:12.160 --> 24:14.260
then you caught him
trying to break in, right?

24:14.260 --> 24:15.960
Yes.
Okay, I understand.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.000
This isn't the place to talk.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.130
There's a room for interrogation...

24:19.130 --> 24:22.640
No, I said this guy had
a knife in his pocket!

24:23.210 --> 24:25.740
What?
If I didn't show up then,

24:25.740 --> 24:26.980
my Young Sook...

24:26.980 --> 24:30.180
and my unborn child
would've died in his hands!

24:30.180 --> 24:33.180
Hey, this is attempted murder!

24:33.180 --> 24:35.350
Darn it.
Excuse me, sir.

24:35.350 --> 24:37.620
Please don't shout. Calm down.

24:37.790 --> 24:39.560
Well, hey.

24:40.490 --> 24:42.960
That thing in your pocket. Pull that out.

24:44.930 --> 24:46.730
Pull it out now.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.630
I'm sorry.

24:50.630 --> 24:53.270
You jerk!
Sir, calm down.

24:53.270 --> 24:57.170
Calm down, sir. That's public property.

24:57.210 --> 24:59.640
I can't see it, so lift it up.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.140
Higher.

25:01.780 --> 25:04.710
Scissors? Why do you carry that around?

25:05.350 --> 25:07.050
I'm really sorry.

25:08.180 --> 25:10.220
What's the charge?
Housebreaking.

25:10.220 --> 25:13.720
It's attempted murder! He has a weapon!

25:13.720 --> 25:16.690
Yes, sir, we get it.
So please stop shouting.

25:16.690 --> 25:18.590
Your child will get shocked.

25:18.830 --> 25:20.460
Well, hey.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.730
Take it as evidence.

25:23.030 --> 25:24.170
Okay.

25:24.570 --> 25:25.970
Grab a seat, please.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.140
Put it in.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.610
Hurry up and put it in.

25:37.780 --> 25:38.880
Name.

25:39.350 --> 25:40.550
Cho Kang Moo.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.950
Age.
Eighteen years old.

25:44.590 --> 25:45.650
Give me your ID.

25:45.650 --> 25:47.760
I don't have one.
My birthday hasn't passed.

25:49.120 --> 25:53.260
Man, you aren't even fully of age.

25:53.500 --> 25:54.960
How did you get in?

25:54.960 --> 25:56.270
I just picked it open.

25:56.270 --> 25:58.270
Yes, so how?

25:58.700 --> 26:00.500
I used those scissors.

26:00.970 --> 26:03.140
You should be studying
instead of doing that.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.640
Who taught you to pick doors
by using scissors?

26:05.710 --> 26:07.680
I just learned it from friends.

26:08.310 --> 26:11.280
Oh, you have some wonderful friends.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.750
What happened to your hair?

26:13.980 --> 26:15.120
Sorry?

26:15.320 --> 26:18.120
Were you wearing a hat?
You have helmet hair.

26:18.220 --> 26:19.560
Oh, yes.

26:21.820 --> 26:23.030
Where's your hat?

26:24.730 --> 26:27.300
Sorry?
Where's the hat you wore?

26:27.900 --> 26:29.700
I lost it on the way here.

26:30.100 --> 26:31.930
I knew it. You're that clumsy.

26:31.930 --> 26:33.270
Get up for a second.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.910
How tall are you?
I'm 167cm.

26:43.550 --> 26:45.850
Kids who say they're 167cm are
always 165cm.

26:45.850 --> 26:47.350
No, I'm 167cm tall.

26:47.350 --> 26:49.950
Then let's compare. I'm 175cm tall.

26:49.950 --> 26:51.120
Let's compare.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.120
People who claim to be 175cm are
just barely over 170cm.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.390
No, you jerk. I'm 175cm tall.

26:55.390 --> 26:56.630
What are you doing?

26:57.060 --> 26:58.330
Is this a blind date?

26:59.430 --> 27:00.760
Sit down.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.500
As for his height...

27:05.500 --> 27:06.600
(Turtle Supermarket)

27:06.940 --> 27:08.340
I'm not sure.

27:08.370 --> 27:10.840
Anyway, he was short enough to be a girl.

27:14.410 --> 27:16.710
His fingerprint identification
will be ready by tomorrow, right?

27:17.380 --> 27:18.380
What?

27:18.380 --> 27:20.620
The scissors.
You just took those in as evidence.

27:20.620 --> 27:21.650
It's not yet...

27:21.650 --> 27:23.150
It'll be ready by tomorrow, right?

27:23.350 --> 27:24.790
Fingerprint identification.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.790
Right?

27:32.730 --> 27:33.860
Yes.

27:34.630 --> 27:36.300
It'll be ready by tomorrow.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.070
What's your address?

27:42.270 --> 27:44.140
Where do you live? You little...

27:56.890 --> 27:58.490
Write down why and how...

27:58.490 --> 27:59.960
you broke into that house in detail.

28:00.890 --> 28:02.020
I just thought...

28:02.760 --> 28:04.990
no one was inside, so I went in.

28:04.990 --> 28:06.160
Write it down.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.730
And don't speak unless spoken to.

28:11.270 --> 28:13.170
Write as many details as you can.
Okay.

28:18.340 --> 28:20.840
Hey, when we were working
on Bang Ki Hoon's case...

28:21.110 --> 28:22.280
Yes?

28:22.580 --> 28:25.780
We had a statement
from a witness about the Red Cap.

28:26.110 --> 28:28.550
Did she say the guy was short?
Yes.

28:29.950 --> 28:32.950
But I doubt that it's him.
He's still wet behind his ears.

28:35.220 --> 28:37.090
Can you ask the victim
if he was wearing a cap...

28:37.090 --> 28:38.730
before he was brought in?

28:38.990 --> 28:40.430
And check if there were any caps...

28:40.430 --> 28:42.000
thrown out on the way here.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.570
Go.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.310
Okay.

28:51.140 --> 28:52.810
Hold on. Not yet.

28:57.810 --> 28:59.250
I'm calling from Dongbu Police Station.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.420
I'm going to register an item
under evidence.

29:01.620 --> 29:03.220
Can you run a fingerprint test on it?

29:03.750 --> 29:05.350
It's urgent.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.920
Put a rush on it.

29:19.940 --> 29:22.270
What you just did is a serious crime.

29:22.740 --> 29:24.940
You were caught red-handed
picking the door with scissors.

29:24.940 --> 29:26.680
That could have been a murder weapon.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.810
They were just scissors.

29:29.210 --> 29:30.810
You can kill people with just scissors...

29:30.810 --> 29:32.180
because you can stab them.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.050
How can you stab someone with scissors?

29:34.050 --> 29:35.320
That's horrible.

29:37.090 --> 29:39.320
You think it's horrible?
Yes.

29:39.550 --> 29:40.960
Which part is horrible?

29:41.190 --> 29:42.460
Stabbing someone?

29:42.460 --> 29:44.460
Or killing someone?

29:44.460 --> 29:46.060
It's both, of course.

29:50.630 --> 29:52.830
How many times have you done this before?

29:53.670 --> 29:55.700
Of course, this is my first time.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.210
You can climb walls too, right?

29:58.270 --> 29:59.510
I saw some thieves in action.

29:59.510 --> 30:01.180
They can easily climb up three floors.

30:01.440 --> 30:04.450
Is it because you're young?
You guys are so full of energy.

30:04.450 --> 30:05.850
It's easy with the pipes.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.390
You can climb through the pipes too?

30:12.390 --> 30:14.220
How tall was the previous house
you broke into?

30:18.060 --> 30:19.590
I know this isn't your first time.

30:20.260 --> 30:22.430
No matter how petty the charge is,
if you don't come clean now,

30:22.430 --> 30:23.970
you'll end up with a heavier sentence.

30:24.530 --> 30:26.740
So just come clean when you have a chance.

30:27.100 --> 30:28.400
That's better for you.

30:29.340 --> 30:30.610
It was on the first floor.

30:33.480 --> 30:34.640
What about the second floor?

30:37.210 --> 30:38.980
Do you remember which house it was?

30:39.980 --> 30:42.520
Your confession must be true
for you to get a lenient sentence.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.030
It was just an ordinary house.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.960
I guess no one was home
seeing how you didn't get caught.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.030
Right. I don't break into houses
unless they are empty.

30:55.030 --> 30:56.630
What if someone was there
when you broke in?

30:57.070 --> 31:00.440
Then I would come out or hide.

31:00.570 --> 31:02.570
You've never been caught other than today?

31:02.700 --> 31:03.840
No.

31:10.710 --> 31:12.010
Write everything down there.

31:12.010 --> 31:14.220
Write down all the houses
you broke into so far.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.120
I'm going to.

31:18.550 --> 31:20.890
But when you keep talking to me,
I get confused.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.170

just you and your grandmother?

31:57.630 --> 31:59.530
Did you talk to my grandmother?

32:00.930 --> 32:02.500
You're a minor.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.100
It's our duty to call your guardian.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.370
Right.

32:09.340 --> 32:11.470
How long has it been
just you and your grandmother?

32:11.770 --> 32:13.340
Ever since I was ten.

32:13.340 --> 32:15.480
What about your parents?
I don't talk to them.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.980
Both of them.
Yes.

32:16.980 --> 32:19.550
Did they get a divorce?
I'm not sure.

32:20.320 --> 32:23.150
My mom ran away, and my dad abandoned us.

32:26.660 --> 32:28.590
Is my grandmother here?

32:28.590 --> 32:29.720
Why?

32:30.460 --> 32:32.060
You don't want to worry her?

32:34.230 --> 32:35.760
Darn it.

32:44.470 --> 32:47.380
(Interview Room)

32:47.380 --> 32:48.980
He didn't lose it.

32:52.550 --> 32:54.350
He put it behind a telephone pole.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.950
Isn't this expensive?
What?

32:59.620 --> 33:02.390
Look at this brand.
Right. It's pretty expensive.

33:03.090 --> 33:05.590
By the way, did you get anything from him?

33:07.230 --> 33:08.830
He can't be the culprit for...

33:10.500 --> 33:11.800
Can you run a fingerprint test...

33:11.800 --> 33:13.540
on the scissors he brought in?

33:13.540 --> 33:16.370
Captain Park already requested it
to be expedited.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.370
I see.

33:22.440 --> 33:23.780
Hold on. Let me borrow that.

33:23.780 --> 33:25.680
If it's not urgent, let me use it.
What?

33:25.680 --> 33:26.880
I just need it for a while.

33:45.430 --> 33:46.600
Is this your hat?

33:51.810 --> 33:53.070
It's yours, right?

33:53.480 --> 33:55.340
It's expensive. Don't lose it.

33:55.940 --> 33:57.080
Thanks.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.680
You must like hats.
Yes.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.350
Write a new one, and number
the houses you robbed this time.

34:03.350 --> 34:06.420
The one you just wrote about is
number 1. The next one is number 2.

34:11.429 --> 34:14.800
(Daebong-dong)

34:16.900 --> 34:18.500
Then you must have
a lot of expensive hats.

34:18.500 --> 34:21.139
I only have one. This is really expensive.

34:21.570 --> 34:23.710
It's just you and your grandma.
You must need bigger allowances...

34:23.710 --> 34:25.969
to buy a hat like that.
She doesn't give me allowances.

34:28.540 --> 34:30.179
I earn money for them.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.719
You must have a part-time job.
Yes.

34:35.750 --> 34:37.920
But you still robbed houses?

34:39.920 --> 34:41.659
I guess you needed more money.

34:41.860 --> 34:43.260
I was bored.

34:43.989 --> 34:45.730
You were bored?
Yes.

34:46.389 --> 34:48.300
I just did it a few times for fun.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.870
Kids around my age
steal other people's stuff.

34:50.870 --> 34:52.170
You've never done that?

34:54.469 --> 34:56.440
I'll never do it again.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.240
I'll promise that I'll never steal again.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.870
Can't I go home?

35:00.240 --> 35:01.540
I can promise that I'll never do it.

35:01.540 --> 35:03.080
Can't you just send me home?

35:03.080 --> 35:06.110
I can't. I told you earlier.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.250
This could have been attempted murder.

35:08.250 --> 35:09.420
You...

35:16.120 --> 35:18.730
How is this attempted murder?

35:20.230 --> 35:22.430
I was just trying to steal a few bucks.

35:23.570 --> 35:26.770
Besides, I couldn't even steal
anything because I got caught.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.740
Once you break in with a weapon,
it's not a simple theft charge.

35:28.740 --> 35:30.240
It's grand larceny.

35:30.610 --> 35:33.680
It's a serious criminal offense
that can put you away for ten years.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.010
And you.

35:36.310 --> 35:37.680
This wasn't your first time.

35:38.710 --> 35:40.150
We need to know
how much money you stole...

35:40.150 --> 35:42.550
and what you did with the money
or the stolen valuables.

35:42.550 --> 35:44.350
So write down when, where,
and how you broke in...

35:44.350 --> 35:46.420
and how much you stole.

35:47.290 --> 35:49.420
And write down
every single thing you stole.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.030
What...

35:52.690 --> 35:54.860
Isn't robbing empty houses
better than extorting money...

35:54.860 --> 35:57.030
from other kids?
Is that what you think?

35:57.030 --> 35:58.300
My neighborhood is full of those kids.

35:58.300 --> 36:00.070
But you don't interrogate them like this.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.740
Is that how
your grandmother will think too?

36:11.680 --> 36:12.910
Write them down.

36:21.660 --> 36:23.690
What kind of part-time job
do kids around your age have?

36:23.690 --> 36:25.290
You...

36:26.660 --> 36:28.700
Do you want me to write it down or not?

36:28.860 --> 36:30.530
Can I just plead the Fifth?

36:30.530 --> 36:32.430
Your questions are really annoying me.

36:35.140 --> 36:37.510
Okay, you're free to do so,

36:38.770 --> 36:41.040
but it could work to your disadvantage.

36:42.140 --> 36:45.610
If our investigation reveals that
you're indeed guilty of everything,

36:45.980 --> 36:48.380
you may be subject
to a heavier punishment.

36:59.360 --> 37:02.200
We interviewed all the delivery guys
who work in the area...

37:02.230 --> 37:04.100
but couldn't track him down.

37:05.330 --> 37:07.670
And as a server.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.680
I'm going to say a bunch of numbers.
Write them down.

37:19.580 --> 37:20.680

37:44.670 --> 37:46.170
I'm sure you know what they mean.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.980
The number 2 at 214 Daebong-dong
means a woman lives alone there.

38:16.910 --> 38:18.340
Okay, what is this?

38:18.340 --> 38:19.970
Two means an adult female.

38:20.070 --> 38:21.680
Three means a kid.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.180
And the number one means...

38:25.210 --> 38:26.680
an adult male.

38:30.290 --> 38:32.050
What's wrong? Are you anxious?

38:33.090 --> 38:34.360
What... What do you mean?

38:36.460 --> 38:37.660
You were...

38:38.360 --> 38:41.030
too meticulous for someone who
robbed houses a few times "for fun."

39:00.150 --> 39:01.580

39:01.820 --> 39:03.050
No, I don't.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.890

39:08.020 --> 39:09.620

the results back tomorrow,

How did you know?

42:03.830 --> 42:05.900
The floor was wet, so I wiped it.

a resident registration number yet,

Stop it!

Let me in just once!

46:42.080 --> 46:43.980
Settle down.

46:43.980 --> 46:46.110
Bring her back to life!

46:46.110 --> 46:49.450
You attacked the victim
who was in her room.

46:49.950 --> 46:51.620
Then you strangled her.

46:52.320 --> 46:53.890
You got on top of her...

46:55.860 --> 46:58.990
and then you took her top off?
Is that right?

46:59.090 --> 47:01.800
Right. You took her top off.

Yet why is it so hard to catch a criminal?

47:27.120 --> 47:29.860
Anyway, good job.

47:34.730 --> 47:36.900
It's a real relief that we ended up
catching him.

47:37.230 --> 47:38.700
If we weren't able to catch him...

47:39.170 --> 47:41.170
there may have been a third victim.

47:41.500 --> 47:42.700
Do you think so?

47:42.800 --> 47:44.870
I feel bad for the victims to say this...

47:45.910 --> 47:47.580
but for a guy who committed
the same murder twice,

47:47.580 --> 47:50.680
committing a third one would be
nothing for him. You know that.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.120
You're right.
Such a young kid who did that.

47:59.320 --> 48:00.620
Cho Kang Moo...

48:00.890 --> 48:03.220
He already showed boldness
in his second crime.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.230
He saw her house key on her...

48:10.630 --> 48:12.230

48:13.100 --> 48:15.840
He erased his traces with
the toilet paper from the bathroom.

When I checked again,
from both Choi and Won's homes...

48:20.040 --> 48:22.840
they only had the cores
of toilet paper rolls left behind.

48:24.010 --> 48:25.680
Why was I so stupid to not notice that?

48:26.850 --> 48:29.680
You can't be perfect. We're human too.

48:30.350 --> 48:33.150
It's our job to find
as many clues as we can.

48:34.990 --> 48:36.190
Which is why I'm saying...

48:36.460 --> 48:39.190
we need to do research on
criminal behavior analysis.

48:39.190 --> 48:40.490
We have to find that out.

48:40.860 --> 48:44.100
Also, it's not as if these guys stop
because they go to jail.

48:44.200 --> 48:45.400
They don't!

48:45.670 --> 48:47.770
Yes, it's important to catch them.

But we have to be prepared for when
they enter back into society.

stemmed from...

49:49.400 --> 49:52.930
his resentment and hatred
towards his parents.

49:53.030 --> 49:55.370
He feels absolutely no remorse
for the murders he committed.

May I have ramyeon?

59:05.050 --> 59:07.150
How much do you take?
Just go.

59:07.150 --> 59:08.780
I don't take money from a friend.

59:15.830 --> 59:17.290
Thank you for finding...

59:18.700 --> 59:19.860
the real culprit.

59:27.170 --> 59:28.800
You were always like that.

59:29.810 --> 59:32.070
You pretended like
you didn't care about people,

59:33.080 --> 59:35.340
but you were always considerate
behind their back.

59:38.690 --> 59:40.510
We'd like to pay the tab.

59:42.590 --> 59:44.180
Sure, eight dollars, please.

59:59.540 --> 01:00:02.570
Thank you for finding the real culprit.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.920
If you're my friend, take it.

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.770
You rascal.
Why didn't you come out sooner?

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:44.920
You weren't on a stakeout, were you?

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.490
Have you read the book?

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:47.980
The one I gave you last time.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.460
We can finally create...

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.150
the Behavioral Analysis Team,

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.020
as long as you agree.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.990
Sorry?

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.720
Do you remember
what I said about profilers?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.900
If you didn't catch Cho Kang Moo,

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.040
he would've continued to murder people.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.930
We can stop that from happening.

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:07.470
Well, we pretty much
stopped Cho Kang Moo too.

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:10.070
Can you explain in simple terms?
Okay.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:13.640
You can officially go around
interviewing inmates.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:14.850
How is that possible?

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.670
You said it was helpful
to visit Yang Yong Chul.

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:21.250
We can just say it was the duty
of the Behavioral Analysis Team...

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:22.650
to go interview Yang Yong Chul.

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:25.790
Those above will have an excuse
to calm the people down.

01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:29.920
And for me, I'm thrilled because
I can finally do some real work.

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.900
It'll definitely help
in resolving similar cases.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.320
It's belated, anyway.
We should've made this long ago.

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:36.560
But I don't exactly know...

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.770
what a profiler does.

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:42.570
It's all right. Just do as you've done.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.180
Others couldn't understand,

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:48.340
but you instinctively knew
that this was necessary.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.840
That's why you continued
to visit Yang Yong Chul.

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.880
And as for studying,
you and I can start doing that now.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:02.490
I believe this was something
someone had to do someday.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:04.520
And I'm convinced...

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.890
that you're the perfect person for this.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.300

Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.570
The new millennium was
announced with vigor...

01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:52.770
in the Jongno area,

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:55.180
and twice as many people
compared to last year have gathered.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.280
And 500,000 people flocked
to Yeouido, Seoul,

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.270
where the Cherry Blossom Festival
took place.

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.620
People enjoyed the spring breeze
with family and lovers...

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:08.340
as they walked along the Han River
with fluttering petals.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.130
Mom! Dad!
You'll fall down. Be careful.

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:40.910
Hey, kid.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.120
Do you want me to buy you ice cream?

01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:54.190
Did you pick one?

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.990
This one.

(Tae Ho's Corner Shop)

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:04.570
Is it good?

01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:09.610
I have more ice cream at home.
Do you want to get some more?

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:15.380
Don't you? Come on, let's go.

01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:30.530
I'll start the briefing.

01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:33.630
A body part of the victim
was found in a residential alley.

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:34.830
A five-year-old girl, Lee Soo Hyun,

01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:36.540
was reported missing.

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.540
And we're checking it now.

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:40.010
A criminal behavioral analyst?
Do you run psychological tests?

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:41.940
We study the minds of criminals.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.280
We want to help you investigate.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.680
To a profiler, policing doesn't come
before examining the minds.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.110
Examine the minds come first.

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:49.620
I must find out what happened
at the crime scene.

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.120
Why was it her?
Where is he hiding?

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.990
What kind of trait does the culprit have?

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:55.310
What kind of person is the culprit?
