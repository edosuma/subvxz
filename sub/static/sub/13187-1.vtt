Okay now, Charlie.

02:39.441 --> 02:43.243
I'm gonna show you
the most beautiful thing
in the world.

02:43.245 --> 02:46.179
- Do you know what it is?
- A shoe.

02:46.181 --> 02:50.150
A lot of people would say
it'd be an oak tree in spring.

02:50.152 --> 02:51.784
It's a shoe.

02:51.786 --> 02:55.522
Lot of people would say
it'd be a field
of woodland flowers.

02:55.524 --> 02:58.525
Do you know what I think
it is, Charlie?
A shoe.

02:58.527 --> 03:00.927
I think it's a shoe.

03:34.261 --> 03:36.329
Every machine.

03:36.331 --> 03:39.899
You'll learn how to work
every machine, Charlie.

03:39.901 --> 03:41.935
And by the time
you're old enough--
and married probably--

03:41.937 --> 03:44.304
taking over the factory
from me.

03:44.306 --> 03:47.941
Believe me, first thing
you notice about a person...

03:47.943 --> 03:50.310
is their shoes.

03:52.780 --> 03:54.747
Come on.

03:54.749 --> 03:57.650
Whoo-hoo!

04:27.248 --> 04:29.015
You know, it's funny.

04:29.017 --> 04:33.453
It's always struck me
that in terms
of love, strength...

04:33.455 --> 04:38.424
and attention to detail,
marriage is pretty much like--

04:38.426 --> 04:39.826
A pair of shoes.

04:42.264 --> 04:44.030
And today, again I'm not wrong.

04:46.468 --> 04:49.969
They take you to places
perhaps you weren't expecting.

04:52.473 --> 04:55.008
My son, off to London.

04:55.010 --> 05:00.413
His fiancée had been transferred
to an even bigger
estate agent's.

05:00.415 --> 05:04.517
And, Charlie, what have you
decided to try your hand
at down there?

05:06.487 --> 05:09.055
Marketing.

05:09.057 --> 05:11.658
Marketing.

05:13.962 --> 05:15.962
To my future
daughter-in-law...

05:19.066 --> 05:20.833
and to my wonderful son.

05:25.839 --> 05:28.308
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

05:38.886 --> 05:41.954
<i>Ah, Mr. Price.</i>

05:41.956 --> 05:44.524
Do let me show you around.

05:44.526 --> 05:48.561
This is the new layout,
designed very much
with the young couple in mind.

05:48.563 --> 05:52.799
As you can see,
one good size bedroom
with en suite shower room.

05:52.801 --> 05:56.936
And, uh, through here,
fully furnished lounge.

05:56.938 --> 06:02.442
Oh, and best of all,
Mr. Price, best of all--

06:04.913 --> 06:06.579

06:09.516 --> 06:11.551
It's not Northampton.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.088
Mr. Price!

08:29.090 --> 08:33.125
He'd have been proud of you
coming back, Mr. Price.

08:33.126 --> 08:38.865
- Charlie.
- Price Factory has to have
a Mr. Price, Mr. Price.

08:42.068 --> 08:43.803
George.

09:07.628 --> 09:08.995
Bugger.

09:21.242 --> 09:23.042
Um--

09:25.812 --> 09:27.246
Dad always used to say that--

09:30.785 --> 09:33.986
and, uh--
and in a sense--

09:38.592 --> 09:39.992
He ain't pressed the button.

09:41.195 --> 09:44.797
My heart is--
Uh, press the red button.

09:53.307 --> 09:55.841
That was a good start.

09:57.077 --> 09:58.978
Right.

10:08.890 --> 10:12.358
I'm not my dad, okay?

10:12.360 --> 10:14.360
You shouldn't expect that.

10:14.362 --> 10:17.930
But I have spent my life
with each one of you
at some point, um,

10:17.932 --> 10:21.267
training on these... machines.

10:22.803 --> 10:24.637
I was bloody useless.

10:24.639 --> 10:26.172
Too right.

10:26.174 --> 10:28.074
Thanks, Don.

10:30.243 --> 10:34.146
Listen, Dad believed...

10:34.148 --> 10:36.282
there would always be a place
for craftsmanship.

10:37.618 --> 10:40.186
And whether you realize it
or not,

10:40.188 --> 10:42.989
that is what you all are--
craftsmen.

10:46.193 --> 10:47.960
So let's make shoes!

10:50.798 --> 10:52.865
"Let's make shoes"?

10:58.705 --> 11:00.806
Oh!

11:00.808 --> 11:03.009
Oh, don't worry, love.

11:03.011 --> 11:05.044
Don't get it
on your jacket.
I'll get some roll.

11:45.218 --> 11:49.221
Pat, what order
is the company working on
at the moment?

11:49.223 --> 11:51.223
Uh, it's a big one, love.

11:51.225 --> 11:53.693
Chambers Wholesale.
Why?

12:05.005 --> 12:07.807
What the hell was he playing at?

12:07.809 --> 12:09.475
I mean, why didn't he--

12:11.044 --> 12:13.212
Why did he carry on making 'em?

12:13.214 --> 12:17.249
This happened before.
1992.

12:17.251 --> 12:22.722
Customer went into receivership,
and your dad got stuck
with 600 Oxfords.

12:22.724 --> 12:27.827
And?
Bill Sampson in London
took 'em at cost.

12:32.833 --> 12:35.401
Right. Pat,
I'm going to London.

12:47.981 --> 12:51.383
See, Harry, I just happened
to find myself with
1,200 pairs of brogues.

12:51.385 --> 12:53.152
And I know
a few years back...

12:53.154 --> 12:55.454
your dad took some
at cost off my dad,
and I just thought maybe--

12:55.456 --> 12:57.523
Yeah, but that was
a few years back,
Charlie.

12:57.525 --> 13:00.226
Things have changed
a bit.

13:00.228 --> 13:03.062
But look.
I'll tell you what.

13:03.064 --> 13:05.931
I'll take 200 pairs
off your hands--
for old time's sake.

13:05.933 --> 13:08.534
Hey, and this hurts.

13:08.536 --> 13:11.871
Being a Forest fan,
giving charity
to a Northampton, uh--

13:11.873 --> 13:16.809
I mean, when I say "charity,"
I'm not, uh--
You know.

13:16.811 --> 13:18.444
Mmm.

13:18.446 --> 13:21.781
Imported from Slovakia.
Do you wanna know how much?

13:25.152 --> 13:29.021
Harry, a Prices shoe
will last a man a lifetime.

13:29.023 --> 13:32.191
Poor soul that buys these
will be back in 10 months
buying new ones.

13:32.193 --> 13:35.461
I know.
And isn't that great?

13:44.471 --> 13:46.172
Spare some change, guv?

13:48.542 --> 13:50.943
Here.

13:50.945 --> 13:54.914
This is a Prices shoe.

13:54.916 --> 13:58.017
And it'll last a man
a lifetime.

13:58.019 --> 14:00.419
You got it in a size 10?

14:02.290 --> 14:05.057
Yeah, slow yourself down
a bit, will ya?

14:19.973 --> 14:22.041
Covering something,
princess?

14:22.043 --> 14:23.442
Hey, where's the fire, love?

14:23.444 --> 14:25.077
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

14:25.079 --> 14:27.880
Where do you think
you're going?

14:27.882 --> 14:29.415
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna harm you.

14:29.417 --> 14:31.350
Just have a little chat.
That's all.
All right, lads.

14:36.556 --> 14:38.490
Hey, easy, love.
Easy.

14:41.061 --> 14:43.863
- What? You wanna, mate?
- I think you should just--
just leave her alone now.

14:43.865 --> 14:45.865
- Don't you think?
- Yeah? Come on, then.

14:45.867 --> 14:47.366
Eh?
Don't you?

14:47.368 --> 14:49.134
What are you gonna do
about it, eh?

15:07.220 --> 15:08.654
Let's go.

15:56.270 --> 15:59.038
Very sweet--

15:59.040 --> 16:01.206
you riding to my rescue.

16:01.208 --> 16:03.175
Very...

16:03.177 --> 16:05.044
Prince Charming.

16:05.046 --> 16:07.079
- Pass me my boobs, will ya?
- Hmm?

16:10.116 --> 16:11.517
Here.

16:12.986 --> 16:16.021
It didn't look like
you needed much rescuing.

16:16.023 --> 16:20.225
Well, a girl has to know
how to look after herself
these days.

16:20.227 --> 16:24.163
There are some very funny
people out there.

16:26.066 --> 16:29.068
How's that wound?
Let's have a look.

16:31.205 --> 16:33.072
Don't flatter yourself.

16:34.240 --> 16:38.978
Vodka. Helps you forget pain.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.747
Well, it does me.

16:53.394 --> 16:55.561
God.

16:55.563 --> 16:57.663
Clean off, again.

16:57.665 --> 17:00.766
Like most things in life,
it cannot stand
the weight of a man.

17:02.302 --> 17:06.238
Oh, there we go.
Oh, God love us.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.140
Oh. Uh, hold on.

17:18.519 --> 17:20.486
Thank you again, Mr.--

17:20.488 --> 17:23.489
Sorry to be presumptive.

They just started school

19:59.713 --> 20:02.281
This is their uniforms,
love. This--

20:02.283 --> 20:06.718
This is their dinners.
We lost the contract
with Chambers, Trish.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.721
Thing is, we lost
the contract with Chambers,
which means--

20:09.723 --> 20:12.758
Actually, don't.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.561
Actually, this is like apologies
for your train running late.

20:15.563 --> 20:17.362
- Doesn't mean anything.
- It's not like that because--

20:17.364 --> 20:19.531
So I'd rather not hear it.

20:21.401 --> 20:23.202
I do mean it.

20:44.857 --> 20:47.826
I don't want to be sitting here
doing this.

20:47.828 --> 20:50.295

Nine out of 10 shoe factories

21:23.364 --> 21:25.964

Start making
equestrian boots.

21:29.036 --> 21:34.606
Browns, they're making--
Oh, whatever. Right.
Climbing boots.

21:34.608 --> 21:38.610
All them other sods,
they went out looking
for their niche markets.

21:38.612 --> 21:42.648
I mean, they just didn't
sit back in their offices
going, "What can I do?"

21:47.320 --> 21:48.520
I'm sorry.

21:52.025 --> 21:55.694
I was just really,
really looking forward

21:57.930 --> 21:59.665
Now I'm not sure
if I can afford it.

22:17.984 --> 22:20.352
In a sense,
it was lucky, really,

22:20.354 --> 22:22.487
that they hadn't got round
to advertising your job.

22:22.489 --> 22:25.057
Hmm. Yeah, lucky.

22:25.059 --> 22:27.392
Listen, Nic--

22:27.394 --> 22:28.827
Oh, wow.

22:29.962 --> 22:31.730
That's the kind of shoe,
isn't it?

22:31.732 --> 22:33.565
Don't you think?
What?

22:33.567 --> 22:35.867
The wedding.
At the altar.

22:35.869 --> 22:37.736
Is that the kind of thing
you were thinking of?

22:37.738 --> 22:40.772
Yeah.
On my foot.

22:40.774 --> 22:43.642
Well, it needs to be
a Jimmy Choo, doesn't it,
to work.

22:43.644 --> 22:46.478
Or a Manolo.
We might have to think
about the wedding, Nic.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.480
Hmm?

22:48.482 --> 22:51.416
Not the wedding
wedding, but--

22:51.418 --> 22:56.121
It doesn't have to be
all live band and shoes
at the altar and all.

22:56.123 --> 22:58.423
Does it?

22:58.425 --> 23:00.992
I mean, at the end
of the day, it's about
the two of us, isn't it?

23:04.630 --> 23:08.533
I-I made 15 people
redundant today, Nic.

24:01.487 --> 24:02.921
Lauren.

24:04.424 --> 24:07.159
Lauren, you haven't heard
what I was gonna say.

24:07.161 --> 24:09.661
Well, does it involve
the words "job back"?

24:10.596 --> 24:11.897
Potentially.

24:18.505 --> 24:20.906
Okay, brace yourself.

24:20.908 --> 24:24.543
Ladies, gentlemen,

24:24.545 --> 24:27.112

I design everything
in that club.

26:03.310 --> 26:09.781
It's my costumes,
my lighting, my dancers.
My show, love.

26:09.783 --> 26:11.850
I mean, it's me.

26:11.852 --> 26:14.219
Bit of a dark horse,
your boyfriend.

26:14.221 --> 26:16.221
Oh, he's my boss.

26:16.223 --> 26:19.591
Well, he <i>was</i> my boss.
I got laid off.

26:19.593 --> 26:22.727
But now he seems to think
I'm his business analyst or--

26:22.729 --> 26:24.996
Uh, look, Lola.
You're gonna have
to excuse Charlie.

26:24.998 --> 26:27.032
Uh, we don't have
many transvestites
in Northampton.

26:27.034 --> 26:30.135
I'm not merely
a transvestite, sweetheart.

26:30.137 --> 26:31.770
I'm also a drag queen.

26:31.772 --> 26:33.738
It's a simple equation.

26:33.740 --> 26:37.175
A drag queen puts on a frock,
looks like Kylie.

26:37.177 --> 26:41.713
Transvestite puts on a frock,
looks like Boris Yeltsin
in lipstick.

26:41.715 --> 26:42.948
There. I said it.

26:43.916 --> 26:45.984
Ta.

26:45.986 --> 26:48.353
Whatever.
Don't kid yourself.

26:48.355 --> 26:50.956
You're never more
than 10 feet away
from a transvestite.

26:52.758 --> 26:55.961
- Hmm.
- You made her redundant,
you miserable sod.

26:58.164 --> 27:00.098
Things aren't very good
in men's shoes.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.300
No. I'm not, certainly.

27:02.302 --> 27:05.070
Yes. Ha. Precisely.

27:05.072 --> 27:06.871
How much do you weigh?

27:09.909 --> 27:11.876
The right amount.
How much do you drink?

27:11.878 --> 27:14.980
No. I mean, um--

27:14.982 --> 27:17.882
They're women's boots,
aren't they,
that you buy?

27:19.185 --> 27:22.988
You have to buy
women's boots
because you--

27:24.957 --> 27:28.193
You see, the distribution
of pressure on a
conventional female heel...

27:28.195 --> 27:30.962
cannot be expected
to support
a man's weight.

27:30.964 --> 27:36.101
Yeah, and if trans--
you know, whatevers--

27:36.103 --> 27:38.103
drag queens
are everywhere,

27:38.105 --> 27:40.372
like you said, then--

27:40.374 --> 27:45.410
Not in a...
ooh, living dead
kind of way, but--

27:46.879 --> 27:50.382
Then do you think
there is a niche market...

27:50.384 --> 27:56.254
for proper, good, decent,
built-to-last boots
for women...

27:57.857 --> 27:59.891
that are men?

28:03.162 --> 28:05.897
All this way for my advice.
I feel like Oprah.

28:05.899 --> 28:09.668
I'd like to measure your foot,
go home, make a pair.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.934
Who gets to keep the boots?

28:44.336 --> 28:46.971
Little warning.
The answer is,

28:46.973 --> 28:49.174
"You do, Lola."

28:49.176 --> 28:51.342
You do, Lola.

28:51.344 --> 28:53.845
Where do I come
to pick it up?

28:53.847 --> 28:55.814
Oh. Prices of Northampton,
is it?

28:55.816 --> 28:58.383
Yeah. Yeah.
Um, I'll come to you.

28:58.385 --> 29:01.152
Oh, no, no. As they say,
a good pair of boots
is worth walking for.

29:01.154 --> 29:04.923
No. You see,
I come here all the time,

29:04.925 --> 29:08.259
and so--
I'll come to you.

29:09.395 --> 29:10.829
Right.

29:12.231 --> 29:15.266
Um, look behind you.

29:16.736 --> 29:18.303
What? What is it?

29:18.305 --> 29:20.338
It's your niche
market, Charlie.

29:25.511 --> 29:27.212
Big niche.

29:56.509 --> 30:02.280
Ladies, gentlemen,
and those of you who are
yet to make up your mind,

Well?

31:58.364 --> 31:59.664
Cool.

32:04.136 --> 32:07.605
I was thinking
that you should--

32:07.607 --> 32:10.308
If you haven't got
anything else on,

32:10.310 --> 32:13.144
that maybe you could
come back to, uh--

32:15.247 --> 32:17.148
To your house?

32:19.118 --> 32:20.685
The factory.

32:24.590 --> 32:27.558
I'm gonna need someone
on the Web to research markets,

32:27.560 --> 32:30.094
and, you know,
if Pat got on some
of those Web sites,

32:30.096 --> 32:31.396
I think she'd have
a heart attack.

32:31.398 --> 32:33.331
Yeah.

32:33.333 --> 32:36.434
Besides, you started it,
being in that strop.

32:36.436 --> 32:40.471
Oh, well--
I mean, I just had
the strop, Charlie.

32:40.473 --> 32:45.043
You saw the idea.
And that is why some of us...

32:45.045 --> 32:48.046
end up with our names
above the factories...

32:48.048 --> 32:50.515
and others just on
the clocking-in cards.

32:52.418 --> 32:54.185
Right.

32:55.554 --> 32:59.290
Well, as someone
with their name
on a factory,

32:59.292 --> 33:02.327
can I invite you
to have your name on one
of my clocking-in cards?

33:11.537 --> 33:14.505
They say-- Calm down.
They say whatever life
throws at you,

33:14.507 --> 33:16.541
whatever emotions
you could ever feel,

33:16.543 --> 33:19.344
somebody somewhere
has written a song about it.

33:19.346 --> 33:22.113
Now I hope
that will be true.

33:22.115 --> 33:26.217
But until somebody writes
a song called
"No One Stays Young Forever,

33:26.219 --> 33:29.454
and One Day I Hope You
Get Dumped for a Younger Model,
You Whiny Little Welsh Bastard,"

33:29.456 --> 33:31.255
I'm just gonna have
to sing you "Memory."

33:32.692 --> 33:36.260
Show us your tits!

33:36.262 --> 33:39.364
Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen,
there they are.

33:39.366 --> 33:40.732
Give 'em a round
of applause.

33:40.734 --> 33:43.401
Thank you.

33:44.770 --> 33:46.771
Are they as wrinkly
as your arms, love?

33:49.042 --> 33:52.010
Is there a man in there?
Yeah, good one.

33:52.012 --> 33:54.212
I have to--
I have to tell you, sweetheart.

33:54.214 --> 33:59.217
My-- My breasts are as smooth
and beautiful as the day
that I bought them.

33:59.219 --> 34:01.285
Get yourself
a refund then.

34:18.737 --> 34:20.170
Bastard.

34:31.150 --> 34:33.583
Oh.

35:19.231 --> 35:21.766
Hey, aye.

35:21.768 --> 35:24.102
Forget it, Don.
Out of your league.

35:24.104 --> 35:29.173
Ah. Seem to forget women
get turned on by the sight
of a working man.

35:39.118 --> 35:41.619
- Morning, Charlie.
- Lola.

35:44.156 --> 35:45.623
Come in.

35:47.292 --> 35:49.560
I'm sorry
it's a bit messy here,
and we, uh--

35:49.562 --> 35:53.164
Uh, I thought we agreed
that I'd come to London.

35:53.166 --> 35:55.233
I have to warn you,
Charlie from Northampton,

35:55.235 --> 35:57.735
I have a terrible habit
of doing exactly the opposite
of what people want.

35:57.737 --> 35:59.437
This way.

35:59.439 --> 36:02.507
In fact, some might say
that attempts
of certain people...

36:02.509 --> 36:06.511
to make a man out of me
as a child is exactly the reason
that I now wear a frock.

36:06.513 --> 36:09.747
If, therefore, I get the feeling
somebody didn't want me
to come to Northampton--

36:09.749 --> 36:13.184
- No. No, no, no, no.
- Also, I can tell from
years of experience...

36:13.186 --> 36:16.287
when I'm being smuggled in
through a rear door.

36:16.289 --> 36:17.922
Oh, that's
the rough stuff room.

36:17.924 --> 36:21.792
- Is it?
- That's where we dump all
the off-cuts and misshapes.

36:21.794 --> 36:23.895
There you go.
I wondered why I was
being drawn to it.

36:23.897 --> 36:25.863
Pardon?
Nothing.

36:25.865 --> 36:27.532
All right, sir.

36:35.774 --> 36:37.375
Hmm?

36:37.377 --> 36:38.743
Oh!

36:38.745 --> 36:40.945
George.

36:42.214 --> 36:43.848
Listen, Mel.

36:43.850 --> 36:46.384
All I'll say
is that when it comes
to attracting women,

36:46.386 --> 36:48.686
some men don't have to speak.
Hah.

36:53.659 --> 36:55.693
This is cozy.

37:13.479 --> 37:14.879
Here we are.

37:25.991 --> 37:27.825
Well?

37:36.635 --> 37:38.002
What do you think?

37:48.247 --> 37:49.747
Burgundy.

37:52.251 --> 37:56.587
Please, God, tell me
I've not inspired
something burgundy.

37:59.591 --> 38:02.360
Red.

38:03.829 --> 38:06.464
Red.

38:07.833 --> 38:08.899
Red!

38:10.836 --> 38:13.037
<i>Red,</i> Charlie boy!

38:13.039 --> 38:15.473
Red...

38:15.475 --> 38:17.341
is the color of sex!

38:17.343 --> 38:19.010
Burgundy is the color
of hot water bottles.

38:19.012 --> 38:23.948
<i>Red</i> is the color of <i>sex</i>
<i>and fear and danger...</i>

38:23.950 --> 38:28.786
and signs that say
"Do... not... enter."

38:28.788 --> 38:31.889
All of my favorite things
in life.

38:31.891 --> 38:35.393
Who's that?
He's got your
new girlfriend in there.

38:35.395 --> 38:36.560
But they're comfy.

38:36.562 --> 38:38.796
Comfy?

38:38.798 --> 38:41.432
Sex shouldn't be comfy!

38:41.434 --> 38:44.669
Thank God.
I thought it was just me.

38:44.671 --> 38:46.771
Now I don't know what you're
used to making around here,
Charlie boy,

38:46.773 --> 38:48.939
but now you're making sex.

38:48.941 --> 38:52.843
Two-and-a-half feet
of irresistible,
tubular sex.

38:52.845 --> 38:56.047
I mean, that heel!
For God's sake!

38:56.049 --> 38:58.349
Yeah, they won't break.
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

38:58.351 --> 39:00.718
Not if it means having
to go around looking like
a bloody Ukrainian peasant.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.587
- Well, it's better than
flouncing around like a--

39:03.589 --> 39:06.724
You want to show your
niche market a little more
respect, Charlie boy.

39:06.726 --> 39:08.059
I mean, let's ask your girls.

39:08.061 --> 39:09.760
No!
Girls.

39:09.762 --> 39:11.962
Would you wear
something like this
to go out?

39:11.964 --> 39:13.964
No!

39:13.966 --> 39:15.900
But you'd look all right
in 'em, sweetheart.

39:15.902 --> 39:17.568
Mmm.

39:19.438 --> 39:22.573
You've pulled.

39:25.877 --> 39:28.546
Oh, yeah.

39:30.949 --> 39:32.416
Ladies.

39:47.933 --> 39:49.367
Ooh.

39:49.369 --> 39:53.371
Well, I'm very
flattered, but, frankly,

39:53.373 --> 39:55.539
if you can't get women
to wear 'em--

39:55.541 --> 39:57.575
you'll never get blokes
like me to wear 'em.

40:13.125 --> 40:15.159
Do we still have a workforce?

40:15.161 --> 40:17.161
Don'll come around.

40:17.163 --> 40:19.029
Once he's stopped, uh--

40:21.634 --> 40:23.801
walking up and down,
swearing.

40:23.803 --> 40:26.670
- Well, that's his problem.
- No. It's <i>our</i> problem, Lola.

40:26.672 --> 40:28.706
This is Northampton.

40:28.708 --> 40:31.742
You have no idea
what it's like, okay?
It's not Soho.

40:31.744 --> 40:33.177
Amen.

40:35.514 --> 40:38.182
Look to the heel, young man.

40:42.621 --> 40:45.689
The sex... is in the heel.

40:56.768 --> 40:59.203
Now what's that
supposed to mean?

40:59.205 --> 41:01.906
"Sex is in the heel"?

41:01.908 --> 41:06.577
Stilettos require
constant balance
from the upper leg,

41:06.579 --> 41:08.579
causing the muscles
of the backside...

41:08.581 --> 41:11.916
to tense and appear pert
and ready for mating.

41:14.886 --> 41:17.721
It's physically
impossible.

41:17.723 --> 41:19.023
I mean, am I
missing something?

41:19.025 --> 41:22.626
To make a stiletto,
something that thin,

41:22.628 --> 41:24.161
bear the weight of a man
is just--

41:24.163 --> 41:26.897
Steel shank.

41:26.899 --> 41:28.699
What?

41:28.701 --> 41:32.636
A steel shank, cut thinly...

41:32.638 --> 41:38.209
then molded in a continuous
section from toe to heel
without pinning.

41:38.211 --> 41:40.811
Not even Don would crush that.

41:45.550 --> 41:46.784
Lola!

41:48.887 --> 41:51.121
Lola, we might be able
to do it.

41:51.123 --> 41:53.891
Steel shanks
without underpinning.

41:53.893 --> 41:56.227
We might be able
to make those boots.

41:56.229 --> 41:59.029
If you could just--
If you were willing to,
you know--

41:59.031 --> 42:01.532
I think Don would
have something to say
about that, don't you?

42:01.534 --> 42:04.969
I gave up the provinces
years ago, Charlie, and I've
just been reminded why.

42:04.971 --> 42:07.671
Lola doesn't do north.

42:07.673 --> 42:09.173
Northampton's the Midlands.

42:09.175 --> 42:11.809
No, Charlie.
Tottenham Court Road
is the Midlands.

42:11.811 --> 42:14.245
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a show tonight.

42:14.247 --> 42:19.583
Yeah. Well, I'm stood here,
trying to save a factory
of four generations--

42:19.585 --> 42:21.252
of my father
and his father's father--

42:21.254 --> 42:23.654
Well, come on, Charlie.
Tell me when that applies
to me, will you?

42:23.656 --> 42:25.890
And how it applies to you.

42:25.892 --> 42:28.726
'Cause I'm about to take
an almighty fucking gamble,

42:28.728 --> 42:33.564
and in one afternoon,
in one <i>drawing,</i> you've said more
about these boots than--

42:33.566 --> 42:37.234
I mean, I just--
Five weeks, Lola.

42:37.236 --> 42:40.738
That's it. I mean, if I don't
have a new collection ready
for the Milan Shoe Fair...

42:40.740 --> 42:42.206
in five weeks,
I'll have blown it.

42:42.208 --> 42:44.542
I'm gonna have
to sell the place.

42:46.144 --> 42:48.212
All right.
I'll tell you what.

42:48.214 --> 42:51.215
Don't hang around.
It's never gonna apply to you.

42:54.586 --> 42:59.323
What you don't realize, Lola,
is this is not my world either.

43:04.797 --> 43:06.063
Where you going,
darling?

43:07.799 --> 43:09.300
By the sound of it,

43:12.137 --> 43:13.704
Milan.

43:34.893 --> 43:36.961
I see this
as a very positive step--

43:36.963 --> 43:40.864
for a company who's spent
the last century making
a range of shoes for men...

43:40.866 --> 43:43.968
to start the next century
making shoes for...

43:44.970 --> 43:46.870
a range of men.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.140
Any questions?

44:02.355 --> 44:05.389
Oh, sorry, love.
Sorry.

44:05.391 --> 44:07.791
I thought you said
you were going in
to work at 9:00.

44:07.793 --> 44:11.729
No. I did, Mrs. Cobb.
I was. I am.

44:11.731 --> 44:13.130
Sorry.

44:29.180 --> 44:30.781
Don!

44:45.797 --> 44:48.165
Have you got
any toilets down here?

44:48.167 --> 44:50.334
I'm afraid we've only got
men's and women's.

44:56.041 --> 44:58.442
Charlie. She's locked herself
in the loo.

44:58.444 --> 45:00.444
What?
Come on.

45:02.747 --> 45:04.415
Right. Go in there,
tell her--

45:04.417 --> 45:06.050
No. The gents' loo.

45:06.818 --> 45:08.419
Right.

45:10.789 --> 45:15.826
Who's that man?

45:15.828 --> 45:17.227
I don't know.

45:21.332 --> 45:24.702
Lola, it's Charlie.
Are you okay?

45:29.941 --> 45:34.745
Are you ill?
Yeah, I'm sick.
Ask your boys.

45:34.747 --> 45:36.346
It this Don?

45:38.183 --> 45:41.251
Oh, has he nicked your dress?

45:43.288 --> 45:46.457
I came like this.
Mmm.

45:46.459 --> 45:47.958
God.

45:49.994 --> 45:55.032
Put on a frock, and I can
sing "Stand By Your Man"
in front of 500 strangers.

45:55.034 --> 45:58.469
Put on a pair of jeans,
and I can't even
sodding well say hello.

46:00.905 --> 46:05.275
I have to say,
I was going to suggest
dressing down.

46:09.848 --> 46:11.882
Well, thank you
for your concern.

46:16.221 --> 46:18.122
Is he crying?
Shh, shh.

46:18.124 --> 46:19.456
Shh.

46:19.458 --> 46:21.191
Come on. Tell me.

46:21.193 --> 46:23.293
Boxer.

46:23.295 --> 46:25.262
Get out of here.
I'm serious.

46:26.431 --> 46:29.266
Yeah, he had me
doing training, weights.

46:29.268 --> 46:32.136
I could bench-press
93 kilos.

46:32.138 --> 46:36.907
I owe all my spectacular
muscle definition
to my father.

46:36.909 --> 46:39.510
What, and he never--
The whole wearing frocks thing--

46:39.512 --> 46:42.212
Oh, well, he wasn't stupid.

46:42.214 --> 46:45.415
He knew there'd be very few
cross-dressing heavyweight
champions of the world.

46:45.417 --> 46:47.317
Yeah.

46:49.420 --> 46:51.555
No. He disowned me.

46:54.826 --> 46:56.160
Wouldn't see me.

47:01.299 --> 47:04.101
Even when he got
lung cancer, he wouldn't.

47:08.807 --> 47:12.309
So-- It's ironic, really.

47:16.015 --> 47:18.148
Fags got him in the end.

47:24.824 --> 47:26.590
I mean, that's what
it was all about.

47:26.592 --> 47:31.161
Fitting in.
Melding in.

47:31.163 --> 47:33.230
Not standing out.

47:35.834 --> 47:38.502
As far as he was concerned,
if you're big and you're
black and you're a boxer,

47:38.504 --> 47:41.839
then you are sorted.

47:41.841 --> 47:45.042
If you're big
and you're black
and you're in a--

47:45.044 --> 47:49.046
you know--
strapless cocktail dress,
that's not so good.

47:49.048 --> 47:51.348
That's what my dad wanted
and all.

47:51.350 --> 47:52.950
Strapless
cocktail dress?

47:52.952 --> 47:54.218
Yeah. No.

47:55.621 --> 47:59.256
For me to fit in,
to this place.

47:59.258 --> 48:02.259
You know it should be me
that's hiding in here,
not you.

48:02.261 --> 48:05.529
I'm the one who doesn't know
what he's doing.

48:05.531 --> 48:09.433
God. It'd kill him
to hear me say that too.

48:09.435 --> 48:12.002
Although he probably knew,
and that's probably
what did.

48:16.608 --> 48:18.275
Well--

48:20.645 --> 48:23.881
Perhaps we just have
to pretend we do know
what we're doing.

48:26.284 --> 48:28.151
Charlie from Northampton,

48:29.420 --> 48:32.055
Simon from Clacton.

48:38.529 --> 48:41.064
Come on.
Let's make boots.

48:41.066 --> 48:42.666
All right.

52:59.590 --> 53:01.725

Morning, stranger.

53:40.966 --> 53:42.766
Mmm.

53:42.768 --> 53:43.934
Nic-- Um--
Thank you.

53:43.936 --> 53:47.337
Look,
about last night--
Mmm?

53:47.339 --> 53:49.673
Things got a little bit
crazy at work, and--

53:49.675 --> 53:52.642
It won't always be like that.
I promise.

53:52.644 --> 53:54.911
No. It really--
It won't be.
Okay. Pssh, pssh.

53:54.913 --> 53:57.380
And, uh--

53:57.382 --> 54:00.717
See, I think I've found
a solution for the factory.

54:00.719 --> 54:01.885
Well, that makes
two of us.

54:03.221 --> 54:04.487
Come on.

54:04.489 --> 54:07.457
<i>One second, Mrs. Cobb.</i>

54:12.897 --> 54:14.698
Oh, God.

54:14.700 --> 54:16.399
Come in.

54:19.537 --> 54:22.606
There we go.
Thank you.

54:22.608 --> 54:24.808
Oh.
And the room's all right
for you then, love, is it?

54:24.810 --> 54:27.577
It's absolutely lovely,
Mrs. Cobb, yes.

54:27.579 --> 54:30.647
Lots of, um--
Lots of trinkets.

54:30.649 --> 54:33.316
Ah. Now, well,
the little pottery shoes--

54:33.318 --> 54:35.285
They're good luck,
you see.

54:35.287 --> 54:38.755
You know, like Whitby
has lucky glass ducks,

54:38.757 --> 54:41.391
Northampton
has lucky pottery shoes.

54:41.393 --> 54:43.793
Can I just ask,
are you a man?

54:47.298 --> 54:48.765
I am, love, yes.

54:48.767 --> 54:50.533
Ah. That's fine.

54:50.535 --> 54:52.969
Just so's I know how
to leave the toilet seat.

54:52.971 --> 54:54.604
I'll get some biscuits.

55:22.800 --> 55:24.668
Mr. Price.

55:24.670 --> 55:26.836
Charlie,
this is Richard Bailey.

55:26.838 --> 55:29.406
I was sorry
to hear about your dad.

55:29.408 --> 55:31.374
Shall we?

55:31.376 --> 55:33.743
The beauty
is the building.

55:33.745 --> 55:36.913
For us developers,
it's more a case
of what we don't do.

55:36.915 --> 55:38.715
Isn't it?

55:38.717 --> 55:42.919
And if you look in here,
you will see... the bedroom.

55:56.067 --> 55:57.734
So? What do you think?

55:58.769 --> 56:00.970
We, uh--

56:00.972 --> 56:03.740
I mean, one day, Nic,
if it's what you want, but--

56:04.975 --> 56:07.110
Isn't it slightly
out of our price range?

56:13.551 --> 56:16.386
Not all buildings
deserve a second life,
Mr. Price,

56:16.388 --> 56:20.957
but factories like this--
like yours--

56:20.959 --> 56:22.525
they're special.

56:25.896 --> 56:28.131
I'm sorry.

56:28.133 --> 56:31.034
Are you under the illusion
that Prices is for sale?

56:33.471 --> 56:35.405
Look, I know
you're trying to help,

56:35.407 --> 56:38.041
but if you'd just
hang in there a bit,
I make you this promise.

56:38.043 --> 56:40.810
Oh, is this a promise
like the Jimmy Choo shoes
wedding promise?

56:40.812 --> 56:43.713
Hang on a minute.
You're talking about the history
of my family there.

56:43.715 --> 56:46.449
Yet isn't this
the future of it
right here?

56:46.451 --> 56:48.451
Well, I don't know,
Nicola. Is it?

56:48.453 --> 56:50.920
I mean, if I can't get you
to summon up a bit of faith
and just--

56:50.922 --> 56:54.023
Okay.
Give me it, Charlie.
Go on.

56:54.025 --> 56:56.092
What have I
got to have faith in?

56:56.094 --> 56:59.629
Now I've suggested
selling the factory
to a brilliant developer...

56:59.631 --> 57:03.466
who's interested
and who's done all that.

57:03.468 --> 57:05.568
You know,
made all that happen.

57:05.570 --> 57:07.103
What's your plan?

57:07.105 --> 57:11.875
Charlie boy!
I found Soho!

57:11.877 --> 57:15.044
A little corner of Soho
in Northampton,
that brasserie.

57:15.046 --> 57:17.881
I mean, we're not
talking Hoxton here,
but never mind.

57:17.883 --> 57:21.084
I'm sorry. I'm Lola.
I'm the one designing
his range of transvestite boots.

57:28.160 --> 57:33.463
This--
There's a slight chill...
in the air,

57:34.165 --> 57:36.132
isn't there?
Yeah.

57:49.146 --> 57:51.014
That is... the--

57:51.016 --> 57:52.782
The plan.
Yeah.

57:52.784 --> 57:55.618
Listen, Nic.
I have not gone
into this lightly,

57:55.620 --> 57:57.620
and there is
a market f-f--

57:57.622 --> 58:02.559
Can I just say, before
you make a fool of yourself
trying to save the factory...

58:02.561 --> 58:05.528
because "It's the history
of my family, Nicola"--

58:05.530 --> 58:08.531
The reason Richard
came to see me,
okay, not you,

58:08.533 --> 58:11.601
was because your dad
had approached him
about selling up.

58:14.772 --> 58:17.774
You see,
you owe your father nothing,
Charlie Price.

58:19.577 --> 58:23.480
You are free to walk.

59:33.050 --> 59:35.118
Right. That's it.

59:35.120 --> 59:38.788
We've terminated production
on all derbies,
brogues and Oxfords.

59:38.790 --> 59:41.257
From now on, the factory
is 100% on the new range,

59:41.259 --> 59:43.593
or we will not hit Milan.

59:43.595 --> 59:46.896
So we need at least
15 new designs from Lola...

59:46.898 --> 59:49.165
and at least
six samples of each.

59:49.167 --> 59:52.835
And remember,
you are not making footwear.

59:53.771 --> 59:56.205
You are not making boots.

59:56.207 --> 59:58.942
You are making
two and a half feet...

59:58.944 --> 01:00:02.812
of irresistible, tubular sex!

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:08.985
None of the major firms
just take a stand.

01:00:08.987 --> 01:00:13.256
All of the big boys
hire the main runway,
so we will need that.

01:00:13.258 --> 01:00:16.192
And we need Milan
to go like, pow!

01:00:16.194 --> 01:00:19.062
Like-- Like the two of us
did that night
at The Angel, yeah?

01:00:19.064 --> 01:00:21.331
I mean, we need
to take The Angel Club
to Milan.

01:00:22.933 --> 01:00:25.034
We will take
The Angel Club
to Milan.

01:00:30.107 --> 01:00:32.609
Well, you wouldn't
put a frock on.

01:00:32.611 --> 01:00:35.712
If you don't want
to get off with blokes,
why would you put a frock on?

01:00:35.714 --> 01:00:39.282
Thing is, Mike,
ask any woman
what she likes most in a man.

01:00:39.284 --> 01:00:44.220
Compassion, tenderness,
sensitivity-- traditionally
the female virtues.

01:00:44.222 --> 01:00:46.889
Perhaps what women
secretly desire...

01:00:46.891 --> 01:00:50.360
is a man
who is fundamentally a woman.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.634
Huh?

01:01:02.106 --> 01:01:03.840
Huh.

01:01:07.711 --> 01:01:08.778
Hmm.

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:17.920
He's coming.
Right.

01:01:36.874 --> 01:01:39.275
Hello, Don. Tell me.
What do you think I could do...

01:01:39.277 --> 01:01:41.044
that would make me
more of a man?

01:01:42.213 --> 01:01:44.247
Got a piece of paper
down here, Don.

01:01:44.249 --> 01:01:47.950
Why don't you write down
what you think
would make me more of a man,

01:01:47.952 --> 01:01:51.888
and I'll write down
what I think
would make you more of a man?

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:54.390
If I do what's on yours,
you do what's on mine, right?

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:58.695
Piss off.

01:02:03.033 --> 01:02:04.167
Fine.

01:02:07.204 --> 01:02:10.006
So is our Don a man,
do you think?

01:02:10.008 --> 01:02:12.108
Well, he dresses like one.

01:02:14.479 --> 01:02:16.179
Good answer.
I was pleased with it.

01:02:16.181 --> 01:02:17.814
Right on, girl.

01:02:19.918 --> 01:02:22.351
Jolly good.
Come on, Don. Be a man.

01:02:30.794 --> 01:02:32.261
You don't
have to do this,
you know.

01:02:32.263 --> 01:02:33.963
Oh, I do.
And you want
to know why?

01:02:33.965 --> 01:02:35.732
'Cause what Don's written
on my piece of paper...

01:02:35.734 --> 01:02:38.801
is a bloody walk in the park
compared to what
I've written on his.

01:02:38.803 --> 01:02:41.370
We've 24 hours.
I could do without
industrial unrest.

01:02:41.372 --> 01:02:44.006
Oh, calm down, Charlie.
It's not boxing.

01:02:52.015 --> 01:02:53.449
Sorry.

01:02:54.518 --> 01:02:57.053
Hmm?

01:03:56.847 --> 01:03:57.580
Play.

01:04:03.954 --> 01:04:06.122
- Nice.
- You can do it! Do it!

01:04:13.131 --> 01:04:15.331
Come on, Lola!
You can do it!
You can do it!

01:04:22.472 --> 01:04:24.140
Come on, Don.

01:05:33.378 --> 01:05:37.980
Yeah! Come on! Come on!

01:05:37.982 --> 01:05:39.181
Don! Don! Don!

01:05:39.183 --> 01:05:40.483
Oh, yes!

01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:07.610
So, the, uh--

01:06:09.179 --> 01:06:10.579
Yeah, well--

01:06:15.053 --> 01:06:16.719
Why'd you stop?

01:06:18.488 --> 01:06:20.356
Well, I wouldn't want you
to walk into the factory...

01:06:20.358 --> 01:06:22.224
and feel that people
didn't respect you, Don.

01:06:23.994 --> 01:06:25.962
I wouldn't want
anyone else to know
what that feels like.

01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:29.165
Oh.

01:06:39.743 --> 01:06:41.410
"Change your mind
about someone."

01:06:47.551 --> 01:06:49.251
Nice one, chap.
Get the beers in, eh?

01:06:49.253 --> 01:06:50.653
Yeah, Don. Get the beers in.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:20.083 --> 01:07:21.684
Oh, Christ!

01:07:24.121 --> 01:07:25.688
How much
does that buy us?

01:07:27.524 --> 01:07:30.426
The main runway,
from between 4:30 to 5:00--

01:07:30.428 --> 01:07:32.261
after Closerie
and before Tricker's.

01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:42.038
Okay.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.672
Hi.

01:07:43.674 --> 01:07:47.443
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- We can't afford it. Mmm--

01:07:47.445 --> 01:07:49.779
Just, just, just--

01:07:49.781 --> 01:07:52.314
How much
for the dancers?

01:07:52.316 --> 01:07:55.117
Oh. Well, all this
is Lola's estimate
for the Blue Angel boys--

01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:56.652
their travel
and their expenses.

01:07:56.654 --> 01:07:58.487
Could you get
the whole thing
for under 20,000?

01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:00.122
<i>Hello. Are you there?</i>
<i>Well, why 20?</i>

01:08:00.124 --> 01:08:02.191
Could you?
Tell me. Why 20?

01:08:02.193 --> 01:08:06.595
Because that is what the bank
will give me against my house.
Hello?

01:08:07.564 --> 01:08:08.597
What?

01:08:10.567 --> 01:08:11.567
Take it.

01:08:12.836 --> 01:08:14.703
<i>Pronto!</i>

01:08:14.705 --> 01:08:18.073
At least one Mr. Price
didn't sit around saying,
"What can I do?", eh?

01:08:18.642 --> 01:08:19.809
Take it.

01:08:24.514 --> 01:08:27.483
Come on, Mel! Tea break
finished five minutes ago.

01:08:27.484 --> 01:08:28.783
Come on.
You know where that goes.

01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:33.856
How are you
getting on, George?

01:08:33.858 --> 01:08:36.392
Fine.

01:08:36.394 --> 01:08:40.162
It's surprisingly easy
if I just imagine
Pat wearing 'em.

01:08:40.163 --> 01:08:41.630
Is it?

01:08:42.466 --> 01:08:44.733
George.

01:08:44.734 --> 01:08:48.270
There's an indentation
in the leather.
Bin it. Do it again.

01:08:48.272 --> 01:08:51.273
I don't care.
Redo it.

01:08:51.274 --> 01:08:53.509
What if they're not assembled
by the end of the shift?
They'll be assembled.

01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:55.743
Well, it's 4:00.
I know when
the end of shift is, Lauren.

01:08:55.746 --> 01:08:57.446
If they have to work over,
they'll work over.

01:08:57.448 --> 01:08:59.615
This is bloody Milan.
You don't get marks for effort.

01:09:02.853 --> 01:09:04.553
Hmm.

01:09:04.555 --> 01:09:07.288
Caffeine.
Give us a hand, would you?

01:09:09.893 --> 01:09:11.727
I needed a break
from Mr. Shouty back there.

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:15.663
He's just tense,
right?

01:09:15.666 --> 01:09:18.834
What?
Are you aware
that you do that?

01:09:18.836 --> 01:09:20.769
That you instinctively
defend him?

01:09:21.738 --> 01:09:23.139
Wow.

01:09:24.307 --> 01:09:25.674
Look at those puppies.

01:09:27.577 --> 01:09:31.247
You know, Charlie's dad
used to have this theory...

01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:33.782
that you could tell
everything about a person
from their shoes.

01:09:36.453 --> 01:09:38.187
Right.
Come on, then.
Oh, no.

01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:39.255
Go.

01:09:41.591 --> 01:09:43.926
Cheap, but happy.

01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:50.232
Oh. Very eager
to please.

01:09:50.234 --> 01:09:51.700
All right. All right.

01:09:51.702 --> 01:09:55.237
Those. Those. Look.
Shiny, but dull.

01:09:56.773 --> 01:09:58.340
Oh, my God!

01:09:58.342 --> 01:10:00.309
Hello, Lauren.

01:10:01.511 --> 01:10:03.812
Hello, Nicola.
Oh, I love those shoes.

01:10:03.814 --> 01:10:05.447
Mmm.

01:10:05.449 --> 01:10:07.716
Charlie's treat?

01:10:07.718 --> 01:10:10.186
- Yeah, once upon a time.
- What?

01:10:10.188 --> 01:10:12.188
A girl can live with so many
once-upon-a-times...

01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:15.524
before she finally
has to get the Visa out
and buy them herself.

01:10:15.526 --> 01:10:17.426
Well, it's not like that
at the factory though, is it?

01:10:17.428 --> 01:10:19.361
Sorry?
Well, Charlie.

01:10:19.363 --> 01:10:21.897
Said he was gonna save it.
I mean, most guys
would have just gone,

01:10:21.899 --> 01:10:23.899
"Hey, you know.
What can I do?"

01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:25.668
Yeah, I know.
Fallen over
at the first hurdle,

01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:27.436
let alone
remortgage their house.

01:10:27.438 --> 01:10:29.572
I mean, you should see him
in that factory, Nicola.

01:10:29.574 --> 01:10:32.741
It's like it's... made him
twice as determined.

01:10:32.743 --> 01:10:36.212
I'm sorry.
Remortgaged the--
What?

01:10:41.985 --> 01:10:43.586
Well.
Hmm.

01:10:45.422 --> 01:10:46.822
How are we?

01:10:48.992 --> 01:10:50.993
No. No. No.

01:10:50.995 --> 01:10:53.996
For God's sake, Melanie.
This is Milan.

01:10:53.998 --> 01:10:55.631
These seams aren't straight.

01:10:55.633 --> 01:10:56.999
You're rushing it.

01:10:58.501 --> 01:10:59.902
Pardon?

01:10:59.904 --> 01:11:01.904
You're gonna have to
unpick all this
and start again.

01:11:01.906 --> 01:11:05.307
Oh. Thought that might--
S-Saturday.

01:11:05.309 --> 01:11:07.843
What?
You've got
enough completed.

01:11:07.845 --> 01:11:09.612
No, I haven't.

01:11:09.614 --> 01:11:11.947
Some of us have got
a life outside this factory.

01:11:11.949 --> 01:11:14.250
Right. You're gonna have
a bloody lot more of it
in a bit.

01:11:16.486 --> 01:11:20.689
Mel, you don't understand.
This... is Milan.

01:11:20.691 --> 01:11:22.658
It's Mil--

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.628
How do you know
what Milan is?

01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:28.731
You don't know.
You're guessing.

01:11:28.733 --> 01:11:31.500
Perhaps you'd
have it finished by now...

01:11:31.502 --> 01:11:36.972
if you hadn't
made us undo
every single bloody stitch.

01:11:36.974 --> 01:11:38.941
But, Mel,
they weren't good enough!

01:11:38.943 --> 01:11:40.776
They'd have been
good enough for your dad.

01:11:40.778 --> 01:11:45.047
But I'm not my dad!
Hey! I'll tell you what,
Charlie Price.

01:11:45.049 --> 01:11:48.317
Never a bloody
truer word.

01:11:48.319 --> 01:11:50.986
- Mel. We have to leave
at 6:00 in the morning.

01:11:50.988 --> 01:11:54.923
- Please!
- Hello, Charlie!

01:11:54.925 --> 01:11:58.794
Nic, sorry. I'm actually
in a bit of a...
crisis here.

01:11:59.696 --> 01:12:01.063
Oh, I think so.

01:12:05.502 --> 01:12:08.504
Is it not bad enough
you're making
this kind of crap,

01:12:08.506 --> 01:12:10.739
- thinking you're gonna save the factory?
-  - Charlie!

01:12:10.741 --> 01:12:12.875
- But the fact you've
remortgaged the house.
- What? I--

01:12:12.877 --> 01:12:14.843
Charlie,
Lauren didn't realize.

01:12:15.745 --> 01:12:17.613
Our house.

01:12:17.615 --> 01:12:21.483
No one will ever say
I didn't stand
by my man, Charlie.

01:12:21.485 --> 01:12:23.952
I've done it.
I'll stand by you now.

01:12:23.954 --> 01:12:26.088
Just-- Reason.

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:27.856
- Nicola.
- Give me a reason!

01:12:28.925 --> 01:12:30.759
Down there.

01:12:30.761 --> 01:12:34.596
Looking at you, Charlie Price.
Give me a reason, standing here,

01:12:34.598 --> 01:12:38.667
making porn wear
for... hermaphrodites.

01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:40.936
Well, actually, love,
hermaphrodites have both sets
of reproductive organs.

01:12:40.938 --> 01:12:42.905
Get out!

01:12:44.575 --> 01:12:46.442
Oh, God.

01:12:52.048 --> 01:12:56.018
Where was it for London,
all this money?

01:12:59.556 --> 01:13:02.991
Don't. Flat the size
of a postage stamp,

01:13:02.993 --> 01:13:04.927
because "We all know.
We have to be careful, Nic."

01:13:04.929 --> 01:13:07.363
But, hey.
Bloody presto--
London was for you.

01:13:09.632 --> 01:13:10.999
London was for us.

01:13:12.502 --> 01:13:14.470
You wouldn't spend
another five grand on us,

01:13:14.472 --> 01:13:16.004
but you'll bloody
remortgage the house...

01:13:16.006 --> 01:13:18.640
to keep a load of people
we don't know in a job.

01:13:18.642 --> 01:13:19.775
I do know them.

01:13:19.777 --> 01:13:21.777
It's you
that doesn't know them,

01:13:21.779 --> 01:13:23.545
because you
never come in here.

01:13:23.547 --> 01:13:26.548
I've already
had to fire 15 of them,

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:29.551
and they were
the 15 worst times of my life.

01:13:29.553 --> 01:13:32.020
- So sell it.
- Nicola!

01:13:32.022 --> 01:13:33.722
I don't get--

01:13:33.724 --> 01:13:36.125
Do they know
your dad was gonna sell up?

01:13:37.627 --> 01:13:41.463
You know? Even your dad.
Have you told them that?

01:13:41.465 --> 01:13:43.699
I don't care
what he was gonna do!

01:13:43.701 --> 01:13:46.735
I don't care that he
was gonna sell the place!

01:13:46.737 --> 01:13:51.840
Okay? I, here, me, now--
Charlie Price doesn't actually
enjoy making people redundant!

01:13:51.842 --> 01:13:55.511
And if you can't hear
a reason yet, Nicola, then
maybe you won't ever get it!

01:13:55.513 --> 01:13:58.013
Maybe you won't ever get me!

01:13:58.015 --> 01:14:02.451
Maybe Nicola Marsden
will never ever
quite get Charlie Price.

01:14:07.724 --> 01:14:09.558
Maybe I won't.

01:14:16.733 --> 01:14:17.866
Oh.

01:15:08.852 --> 01:15:10.586
Sod it!

01:15:14.691 --> 01:15:18.494
It's probably my fault--
putting Dad up,
making some hero out of him.

01:15:19.596 --> 01:15:22.631
Shouldn't do that.

01:15:22.633 --> 01:15:27.169
I suppose I just didn't
want to be the last photo
in the line. You know?

01:15:27.171 --> 01:15:30.038
The Price
who left nothing.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.208
Maybe you shouldn't
judge it in bricks, Charlie.

01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:36.011
Maybe you judge
what you leave behind...

01:15:36.013 --> 01:15:37.846
by what you inspire
in other people.

01:15:52.529 --> 01:15:53.662
Charlie?

01:15:59.836 --> 01:16:03.005
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
'Scuse me, please.

01:16:03.007 --> 01:16:04.873
Coming through!
Hurry up, then!

01:16:04.875 --> 01:16:06.041
Beep, beep!

01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:09.244
Coffee?
Cup of tea?

01:16:11.848 --> 01:16:14.249
Lola.
Charlie.

01:16:14.251 --> 01:16:17.653
Did you get them
to do this?

01:16:17.655 --> 01:16:20.856
Rather rose to the challenge
of changing his mind
about someone.

01:16:20.858 --> 01:16:22.157
You?

01:16:22.159 --> 01:16:24.626
No, Charlie. You.

01:17:12.809 --> 01:17:14.276

a documentary once.

01:20:32.009 --> 01:20:35.410
Potholers. They'd always
have a celebration the night
before they went down,

01:20:35.412 --> 01:20:37.145
in case
they never came out.

01:20:37.147 --> 01:20:40.816
And of course,
now Northampton
is the perfect venue.

01:20:40.818 --> 01:20:44.052
- Oh, I, uh--
- Oh. A little warning.

01:20:44.054 --> 01:20:45.854
The answer is,
"I'd love to, Lola."

01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:57.465
Stop it.

01:21:00.303 --> 01:21:02.270
Table for one?
Uh, for two.

01:21:02.272 --> 01:21:05.040
Two. Right here.
I'll just use
the toilet.

01:21:05.042 --> 01:21:07.242
Toilets, yes.
Just down the stairs,
on the left.

01:21:16.118 --> 01:21:17.285
Richard.

01:21:18.855 --> 01:21:21.523

Oh, no. Absolutely.

01:21:24.328 --> 01:21:26.962
I j-- Wow.
Um-- Uh--

01:21:26.964 --> 01:21:29.331
Didn't expect to see you
at La Conceria.

01:21:29.333 --> 01:21:32.000
Not one of your
normal haunts, this,
is it?

01:21:32.002 --> 01:21:34.336
Yeah. I'm having a meeting.
Sort of business.

01:21:34.338 --> 01:21:36.338
Business.
God. That's, uh--

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.973
Never lets up, does it?
Same with me.

01:21:50.586 --> 01:21:52.954
Hey. They're running away.

01:22:30.493 --> 01:22:33.028
Charlie boy!

01:22:36.532 --> 01:22:38.333
Sorry I'm late.
You know how it is.

01:22:38.335 --> 01:22:40.402
I'm sitting there
with all my dresses
on my bed,

01:22:40.404 --> 01:22:44.472
and I'm thinking, "Is it hot
in Milan? Is it cool?
Does it get cold at night?"

01:22:45.207 --> 01:22:47.676
Oh. Thank you.

01:22:48.377 --> 01:22:50.312
Ooh.

01:22:50.314 --> 01:22:52.147
You couldn't get me
a Bloody Mary,
could you, sweetheart?

01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:53.615
Bloody Mary for the lady.

01:22:53.617 --> 01:22:55.350
The whole potholing thing.
The whole--

01:22:55.352 --> 01:22:57.986
I didn't mean it.
I don't think it will
go tits up, Charlie.

01:22:57.988 --> 01:22:59.587
I mean, the show,
the routine!

01:22:59.589 --> 01:23:01.523
Wait till you see
what I've got planned
for the catwalk.

01:23:01.525 --> 01:23:04.125
- I mean,
if we market it right--
- Could you talk a bit--

01:23:04.127 --> 01:23:05.994
'Cause it's not just us
who'll go for 'em.

01:23:05.996 --> 01:23:08.096
There's a whole club scene
as well, the whole
metrosexual crowd--

01:23:08.098 --> 01:23:10.665
Stop.
What?

01:23:10.667 --> 01:23:13.368
People are staring.
Come on. What do you want?

01:23:15.072 --> 01:23:19.641
You are a man
in a frock in Northampton.
Of course they're staring.

01:23:19.643 --> 01:23:21.109
Even if they're not looking,
they're staring.

01:23:23.145 --> 01:23:24.679
I'm a--

01:23:24.681 --> 01:23:27.415
I'm a Northampton
shoe designer, Charlie.

01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:30.618
Yeah. You're that as well.
You're also a man in a dress.

01:23:32.421 --> 01:23:35.390
You make it sound
as if I put this on...

01:23:35.392 --> 01:23:37.292
because of a lack
of a pair of trousers.

01:23:40.196 --> 01:23:42.130
Is there a part of you
that actually believes that,
Charlie?

01:23:42.132 --> 01:23:44.599
No. I don't know
why you wear dresses.

01:23:44.601 --> 01:23:46.534
And I don't think
you do either.

01:23:52.208 --> 01:23:54.275
I didn't realize
I was causing you trouble!

01:23:54.277 --> 01:23:57.579
Forget it. All right?
You are a very good designer.

01:23:57.581 --> 01:24:00.382
But actually, you'd like me
to come up and design
and then disappear when I'm me.

01:24:00.384 --> 01:24:02.283
Lola, "you"
<i>is</i> the designer.

01:24:02.285 --> 01:24:04.686
This is not you.
This is you in a dress,
looking daft.

01:24:04.688 --> 01:24:06.388
All right?
And you don't
have to do it.

01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:08.156
I don't know
what you think,

01:24:08.158 --> 01:24:10.658
if this is all part
of dodging what sex
you actually get off on.

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:13.461
If you think you are
somehow being mystical--

01:24:13.463 --> 01:24:15.196
being, ooh,
the best of either sex--

01:24:15.198 --> 01:24:17.432
I have to tell you,
Simon--

01:24:20.369 --> 01:24:22.437
Simon.

01:24:22.439 --> 01:24:25.206
Stood there
in a frock right now,

01:24:25.208 --> 01:24:27.675
you look like
the worst bits of both.

01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:44.559
Stop hiding. Be brave.

01:24:44.561 --> 01:24:46.394
Decide one way
or the other.

01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:49.597
And for my sake,
tomorrow,

01:24:49.599 --> 01:24:51.433
please turn up
looking like the picture
on your passport.

01:25:40.783 --> 01:25:43.151
I can't change
what I want, Charlie.

01:25:44.854 --> 01:25:48.256
I cannot...
change what I want.

01:25:50.593 --> 01:25:52.360
I cannot do that.

No. Actually, she, um,

01:26:12.516 --> 01:26:14.716

fly out with the girls.

I had an argument with her.

With Lola.

in the restaurant. See--

There was a bloke
that wanted to buy the factory--
Richard Bailey.

01:29:44.894 --> 01:29:47.762
He was there
with Nicola at the restaurant,
and I mean, I just--

01:29:47.764 --> 01:29:49.630
All that, love,
does not apply to me,
all right?

01:29:49.632 --> 01:29:52.867
What applies is that
there is nobody here
to wear our boots...

01:29:52.869 --> 01:29:55.837
