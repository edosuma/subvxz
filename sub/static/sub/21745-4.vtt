WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.337
You jerk.
It's not funny.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.339
Yes, it is.
Stop it!

00:05.373 --> 00:07.408
(running footsteps)
(door slams)

00:07.441 --> 00:10.744
ANNOUNCER: Better Things.
All new Thursdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.684
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.355
(knob clicking)

00:21.389 --> 00:23.424
* Ow

00:26.460 --> 00:29.263
* They call it magic

00:29.297 --> 00:31.365
* They call it dynamite

00:31.399 --> 00:34.935
* You know you know it
when you get it right *

00:34.968 --> 00:37.938
* They call it the breeze

00:37.971 --> 00:39.373
(smoke alarm beeping)

00:39.407 --> 00:41.209
* They call it out of sight

00:41.242 --> 00:43.611
* You know you know it
when you get it right *

00:43.644 --> 00:45.613
* Yeah

00:45.646 --> 00:48.048
* So bad, so bad, so bad

00:48.082 --> 00:50.551
* Oh, yeah

00:53.921 --> 00:57.591
* How bad do you want it?

00:57.625 --> 00:58.926
(sighs)

00:58.959 --> 01:00.361
Big day today.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.929
I'm meeting
with the publishing house

01:01.962 --> 01:04.365
about the strategy
for the new book.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.967
Of course,
marketing budg...

01:07.000 --> 01:09.470
Why aren't you listening
to me? I'm fascinating.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.139
Oh, I'm on a dating app now.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.073
I was hoping to find romance,

01:13.107 --> 01:15.476
but every girl I match with just
ends up wanting to be friends.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.978
Like, on Friday, I'm
helping a girl move a futon

01:18.011 --> 01:20.047
into her apartment, but
we've got to be done by 5:00

01:20.080 --> 01:21.282
because she's got a date.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.083
Well, the good news
for you is that

01:23.117 --> 01:26.120
these sites attract desperate,
soon-to-be spinsters

01:26.154 --> 01:28.222
with the self-esteem
of a shelter pet.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.090
And that knowledge
can help you.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.092
Have you tried negging?

01:32.126 --> 01:35.229
Isn't that something lame dudes
did, like, ten years ago?

01:35.263 --> 01:36.564
Now it's making a comeback.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.098
Like pubes and racism.

01:38.132 --> 01:41.101
See, to neg,
you employ criticism

01:41.135 --> 01:44.305
couched as compliments
to prey on low self-esteem.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.574
Par exemple,
"Oh, I love your top.

01:46.607 --> 01:50.144
My mother had the same one
before she lost four stone."

01:50.178 --> 01:52.480
I can't be mean
to someone I like.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.448
Those are the best people
to be mean to.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.684
They never see it coming...
ugly.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.421
This is the survival
of your genes.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.323
You have to be aggressive.

02:02.356 --> 02:06.294
Like they say, "Tits or GTFO."
What does that stand for?

02:06.327 --> 02:07.961
I'm not sure exactly.

02:07.995 --> 02:13.434
I think maybe,
"Tits... or get thy fanny out."

02:13.467 --> 02:15.469
Mm, I could give it a shot.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.538
Hey, maybe
we could be app buddies.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.507
I'm assuming you're dating now.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.275
(clears throat)
That would be a "no."

02:21.309 --> 02:25.012
Actually, I'm guardedly excited
about how things went

02:25.045 --> 02:26.480
with Gretchen the other night.
Jimmy,

02:26.514 --> 02:28.148
I think it's over.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.983
No. You heard her.

02:30.017 --> 02:33.654
She said that everything between
us was, and I quote, "okay."

02:33.687 --> 02:35.356
Did you notice how she said it?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.990
Weird and flat like someone

02:37.024 --> 02:39.026
who's about to do something bad
on Facebook Live.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.361
Edgar, bit of advice.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.496
Try not to dig
beneath the surface of things.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.998
With your pathetic
analytic skills,

02:45.032 --> 02:47.568
you really should take
everything at face value.

02:47.601 --> 02:51.539
You know, like, when I say,
"Oh, Edgar, you idiot."

02:54.107 --> 02:56.043
Hmm.

03:00.714 --> 03:04.017
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:04.051 --> 03:06.153
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:06.186 --> 03:08.456
* Gonna leave you anyway.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.596
(sighs) I've gotten it down
so I only have to sleep

03:15.629 --> 03:17.265
three and a half hours
a night.
(Lindsay giggles)

03:17.298 --> 03:20.100
My metal work is more honest
in the pre-dawn hours.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.770
(Lindsay laughs loudly)

03:22.803 --> 03:24.238
That's so funny!

03:24.272 --> 03:25.273
Why is that funny?

03:25.306 --> 03:27.174
(sighs, chuckles)

03:27.207 --> 03:29.042
I don't know.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.412
(whispers):
Watch this.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.248
Ow!

03:34.282 --> 03:36.717
Oh, my God, I'm sorry!

03:39.219 --> 03:41.088
Uh, let's go.
Right.

03:43.090 --> 03:46.394
'Sup, ninja? Why aren't you
answering your phone?

03:46.427 --> 03:50.097
Because I'm busy trying
different clothes combinations

03:50.130 --> 03:54.368
on this...
alive mannequin thingy.

03:54.402 --> 03:55.803
Shouldn't you be at work, too?

03:55.836 --> 03:57.705
Nah. I was
so cranked up

03:57.738 --> 03:59.707
from messing with
Jimmy's head,

03:59.740 --> 04:03.076
I decided to blow off
work and treat myself

04:03.110 --> 04:06.280
to a liquor-store lunch instead.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.716
So, I forgot to tell you.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.151
I had sex with that dummy Ty.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.487
What?!
And then,

04:13.521 --> 04:16.657
later that same day,

04:16.690 --> 04:18.759
I boned his
best friend.
What?!

04:18.792 --> 04:20.828
Should I try a walk, or...?
Shut up!

04:20.861 --> 04:23.464
Plus, he's married,
so it can't be a thing.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.434
That's right--
two guys in a row,

04:26.467 --> 04:28.135
just like senior prom.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.640
Ooh! Micheladas are much better
when they're cold.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.141
PRISCILLA:
Hey, Lindsay.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.777
Hi, Lindsay's troubled friend.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.178
Good news.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.580
We just signed

04:39.613 --> 04:41.582
to dress Casey Affleck's
lawyer for all future

04:41.615 --> 04:44.284
court appearances,
press conferences
and depositions.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.254
Looks like Mama's
getting her boat.
That's amazing!

04:47.287 --> 04:48.456
Do you want to stay
late with me tonight?

04:48.489 --> 04:50.190
We can get dinner,
force Carl

04:50.223 --> 04:52.660
to make coffee and
froyo runs. Make it fun.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.628
Oh, farts. I promised my sister
I'd babysit,

04:54.662 --> 04:56.697
but I could cancel
if you want me to.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.132
No, that's okay. I can
harass him by myself.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.703
Pants... as a hat?

05:04.237 --> 05:05.639
I like it.

05:05.673 --> 05:09.477
It's fun, right?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.813
Ew. You have to hang out
with that ugly-ass baby?

05:12.846 --> 05:15.883
That thing looks like Billy
Corgan fell asleep in a Jacuzzi.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.819
I know, but thank God
I had a legit excuse.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.621
(quietly):
Priscilla's always here.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.790
She eats, sleeps and shits work.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.825
I don't want to
shit work, Gretchen.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.461
I once shit out one of those
little wooden ice cream spoons,

05:27.495 --> 05:29.196
and I couldn't sit down
for a week.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.232
Hey, want to do
something fun?

05:41.542 --> 05:43.176
We'll be in the man cave
recording the podcast,

05:43.210 --> 05:44.545
so if she cries like a little
bitch, just babble at her.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.179
You can say anything
on account

05:46.213 --> 05:48.516
of her soft-ass baby brain
being all stupid and soft.

05:48.549 --> 05:51.318
Check it.
Hey, dumb baby.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.653
Guess what
Daddy did at work.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.355
He used an oscillating
bone distractor

05:55.389 --> 05:56.857
to try and relieve
an old lady's

05:56.890 --> 05:59.693
craniofrontonasal
dysplasia, and we lost her

05:59.727 --> 06:01.361
on the table.
Yes, we did.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.730
We lost her.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.931
BECCA:
Hey, guys.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.899
This is my GBF, Walter.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.235
We met at the bar in Gelson's.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.703
He and his hubby also
have a three-month-old.

06:09.737 --> 06:13.206
And I'm definitely the
Becca in my marriage.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.208
I would say that Troy is the
Vernon, but he has money

06:15.242 --> 06:17.277
(whispers):
and a chin.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.712
(laughter)

06:18.746 --> 06:21.214
You're late.
(in baby voice):
I'm "saw-wee."

06:21.248 --> 06:24.217
I had to leave my job
as a professional stylist

06:24.251 --> 06:26.386
so I could babysit for "fwee."

06:26.420 --> 06:29.790
Hey, being a mom is the most
important job in the world.

06:29.823 --> 06:33.260
Don't indoctrinate my baby
with your libtard bullcrap.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.395
(chuckles)

06:35.429 --> 06:37.898
Normally, I don't let my sitters
bring their friends,

06:37.931 --> 06:39.767
especially when one is

06:39.800 --> 06:41.569
clearly intoxicated,

06:41.602 --> 06:43.537
and the other one's probably
in our country illegally.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.938
(stifled laugh)
(laughs)

06:44.972 --> 06:47.541
I can say that
because I voted for Obama.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.544
The first time.
(scoffs)
Lock her up!

06:50.578 --> 06:52.746
BOTH:
Lock her up! Lock her up!

06:52.780 --> 06:54.815
(both chuckling)

06:54.848 --> 06:57.718
Um, I have to run.
(gasps)

06:57.751 --> 07:00.554
Yeah, Troy's on this new thing
about eating dinner at the table

07:00.588 --> 07:02.623
and just talking, like
friggin' psychopaths?

07:02.656 --> 07:04.257
You should do what I do.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.793
I just make Vernon eat
in the car.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.895
(both laughing)
Joke's on you.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.897
I get to eat dinner
with Joe Rogan every night.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.632
(laughs)

07:14.802 --> 07:17.270
Mmm.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.473
What?! No!
Jon Cryer just canceled.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.841
Damn it!
We can't just not

07:20.874 --> 07:22.643
do the podcast.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.278
We already blew the Red Napkin
cash on Tallulah's eye medicine.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.615
Gretch, you just had
some crazy stuff go down.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.517
You want to come get deep
in the man cave?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.785
Mm. No, Vernon, she doesn't...
she doesn't want to.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.655
Sure. I am owning
what Jimmy did to me.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.858
I am not living
in silence anymore.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.493
Plus, I am

07:39.527 --> 07:40.694
drunk as shit
on this clam booze,

07:40.728 --> 07:42.295
so I'm down for whatever.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.798
Come on, I'll get you set up.
Listen, when I ask you

07:44.832 --> 07:47.300
if you wish you could have
all your dinner ingredients

07:47.334 --> 07:49.002
delivered to your door,
say yes.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.438
I mean, I know
that seems obvious,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.507
but for some reason,
Janeane Garofalo said no.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.546
*

07:59.980 --> 08:01.481
They're ready
for you.
Ah.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.517
(clears throat)

08:05.919 --> 08:07.688
(applause)

08:09.857 --> 08:12.660
"Simon entered the room as he
entered a woman: deliberately,

08:12.693 --> 08:14.494
"with no appetite
for the bromidic.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.330
"For Simon, even the
humdrum was veined thick

08:17.364 --> 08:18.666
with decadence."
"With decadence."

08:18.699 --> 08:21.835
I'm Candace Sebring,
head of marketing.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.003
This is my rock star team.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.906
And we all love the book!

08:25.939 --> 08:28.542
(cheering and applause)

08:31.411 --> 08:32.746
We have been

08:32.780 --> 08:35.515
looking for you
for three months!

08:35.549 --> 08:37.350
Oh. (laughs)
Our little
disappearance artist.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.820
We can't wait for you to see
the mock-up of your cover.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.356
Yes. Well, it is a tricky one,
what with having to capture

08:43.390 --> 08:45.092
the tenor
and zeitgeist

08:45.125 --> 08:50.030
of three wildly different
periods in London's...

08:54.735 --> 08:57.037
I'm, um...
I'm-I'm just confused,

08:57.070 --> 09:00.540
because that looks
like a sex book

09:00.574 --> 09:03.543
for horny airport ladies.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.913
My book is, of course,
literature.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.048
Oh, Jimmy. No, this
is just marketing.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.585
We want your genius to have the
best possible chance to succeed.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.754
Which is why we're putting it
in the erotica section.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.089
(all agreeing)

09:16.123 --> 09:19.727
If it's marketed as erotica
and it's in the erotica section,

09:19.760 --> 09:21.394
then it's erotica.

09:21.428 --> 09:24.031
If what's inside is literature,
it's literature.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.098
(all agreeing)

09:25.132 --> 09:26.900
Then why not market it
as literature?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.401
Because nobody buys literature.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.103
They do buy erotica.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.806
And they're definitely gonna buy
this erotica.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.742
You just said it's not erotica!
Which is what makes it

09:34.775 --> 09:36.043
so erotic.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.911
Imagine what happens
when an overworked mom

09:37.945 --> 09:41.581
lights her scented candles,
slips into her bubble bath,

09:41.615 --> 09:43.984
opens your book and realizes

09:44.017 --> 09:46.453
this isn't just sexy as hell--

09:46.486 --> 09:48.488
it's actually a
really good book.

09:48.521 --> 09:51.625
She'll squirt so hard,
that tub will overflow!

09:52.459 --> 09:53.661
Besides,
we've already paid

09:53.694 --> 09:55.663
for the most prominent spots
in all the major chains.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.798
Right next to some
of our other hot titles.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.603
Bye!

10:03.637 --> 10:05.472
Jimmy. (chuckles)
Jimmy.

10:05.505 --> 10:09.009
Jimmy, we're doing a reading
tonight at The Straining Corset.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.679
Some of our authors from our
Silk Sheets line are reading,

10:11.712 --> 10:14.748
and we're hoping
that you will, too.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.450
All of the top erotica
bloggers and tastemakers

10:17.484 --> 10:19.452
will be there.

10:19.486 --> 10:22.656
At least... think about it.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.633
EDGAR:
Wow. As if.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.468
(scoffs)

10:35.502 --> 10:37.504
Ugh.
Unbelievable!

10:38.505 --> 10:39.807
Seriously?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.975
Stop it!

10:42.009 --> 10:44.644
I'm trying to stare at
this baby real quick.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.780
Well, Jimmy told me
to neg these girls,

10:46.814 --> 10:49.549
but I just keep getting back
all sorts of rude comments

10:49.582 --> 10:51.218
and no titties whatsoever.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.955
It's like they don't even care
if they get thy fannies out.

10:54.988 --> 10:55.856
What'd you write?

10:55.889 --> 10:58.225
Um, um, "Damn, girl,

10:58.258 --> 10:59.960
"what's up with those nostrils?

10:59.993 --> 11:02.029
You Airbnb'ing them shits?"
(chuckles)

11:02.062 --> 11:03.196
"Titties or GTFO."

11:03.230 --> 11:04.497
That would work on me,

11:04.531 --> 11:05.966
but why are you
talking like that?

11:05.999 --> 11:09.036
It sounds wrong. Like if
your cat started barking.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.670
Oh, my God,
how cute would that be?
I know!

11:10.704 --> 11:11.805
That would be so cute!
As soon as I said it,

11:11.839 --> 11:13.841
I was like, "Aw!"
Aw!

11:13.874 --> 11:16.043
(coos)
Well, being nice

11:16.076 --> 11:17.510
didn't work.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.511
And doing Jimmy's strategy

11:18.545 --> 11:20.180
of being mean didn't work.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.549
So... what can I do?

11:22.582 --> 11:23.984
Give up. Die alone.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.554
Or-- oh, and stay with me here--
what if I combine

11:27.587 --> 11:30.557
the intensity of my
natural, intimate approach

11:30.590 --> 11:33.693
with the aggressive
manipulation of negging?

11:33.727 --> 11:35.662
That's ridiculous.
It'll never work.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.997
I'm gonna go practice
this in the place

11:37.030 --> 11:39.767
where all the greatest
flirting is done:

11:39.800 --> 11:41.034
the toilet.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.736
The toilet.
I was gonna say that.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.741
(sighs)

11:56.283 --> 11:59.753
*

12:06.593 --> 12:07.895
GRETCHEN:
And once I realized

12:07.928 --> 12:09.629
it wasn't some elaborate heckle

12:09.662 --> 12:11.564
and he really
wasn't coming back,

12:11.598 --> 12:14.567
I walked down toward the
Hollywood Bowl to get a signal.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.237
I almost got trampled
by a pack of wine-drunk

12:17.270 --> 12:18.705
50-year-olds

12:18.738 --> 12:21.108
with picnic baskets,
but my cab finally came.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.310
(tires screeching sound effect)

12:23.343 --> 12:25.879
I just can't believe what
I'm hearing. That's not Jimmy.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.614
You must have misunderstood.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.282
How?
Unknown.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.985
You just had to have.
No way. Uh-uh.

12:32.019 --> 12:35.889
Jimmy is way too manly a boss to
punk out on a bitch like that.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.258
I just want to say
that you are so brave

12:38.291 --> 12:40.961
for showing your face
after that humiliation.

12:40.994 --> 12:44.597
I would've changed my name,
cut off all my hair,

12:44.631 --> 12:47.267
gotten a neck tattoo,

12:47.300 --> 12:50.637
joined a golf league
at the local par 3,

12:50.670 --> 12:53.106
maybe rent a little efficiency

12:53.140 --> 12:54.942
in Marina Del Rey
where the water

12:54.975 --> 12:56.309
meets the
sky and...

12:56.343 --> 12:58.311
a woman
can just live her life out loud

12:58.345 --> 13:02.249
without judgment or labels...

13:02.282 --> 13:05.018
Whatever. He's the one
who should be ashamed, not me.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.253
I know Jimmy better
than anybody.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.787
He could never do
something like that.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.189
It was probably
some cool-ass prank

13:09.222 --> 13:10.991
like Jamie Kennedy would do.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.293
Jimmy is
a psychopath.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.694
I woke up in the middle

13:14.727 --> 13:15.795
of the night one time,

13:15.829 --> 13:18.298
and he was editing a picture
of my feet

13:18.331 --> 13:19.766
on one of those Facetune apps.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.268
I once walked in
on him

13:21.301 --> 13:24.304
masturbating to a story
written by an 11-year-old.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.374
(car horn sound effect)
That was supposed to be
sexy moaning.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.944
Stop it!
Stop ripping on my best friend!

13:30.978 --> 13:33.146
I am just glad
to be done with the whole thing!

13:33.180 --> 13:35.148
Sure, I'm out some rent money,
but it's a small price.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.149
Wait a minute,

13:36.183 --> 13:37.851
you paid rent in advance?

13:37.885 --> 13:39.152
Yeah, like, half a year.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.354
I was once right up
on that same hill

13:41.388 --> 13:43.156
getting proposed to by Jimmy.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.992
I said no and
you said yes,

13:45.025 --> 13:48.228
which really adds
extra humiliation for you.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.363
But that's not the point.
The point is,

13:50.397 --> 13:53.867
why does Jimmy get
to decide everything?

13:53.901 --> 13:58.005
Yeah! He disappeared and I don't
get to live in my house anymore?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.839
Stop it!
It's not fair!

13:59.873 --> 14:01.308
That butthole can't do that!

14:01.341 --> 14:04.144
You guys can't say that stuff
about my friend!

14:04.177 --> 14:05.212
I'll walk out!

14:05.245 --> 14:06.413
This is my show!

14:06.446 --> 14:09.182
Did you ever catch him
plucking his nipple hairs?

14:09.216 --> 14:10.183
(laughs)
That's it!

14:10.217 --> 14:11.384
Podcast over!

14:11.418 --> 14:14.421
Hey! We have a financial
commitment, mister.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.156
Oh, yeah.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.226
Just joking around there, guys.
Ha-ha.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.994
(soft music playing)
You guys,

14:21.028 --> 14:23.997
I love Ned Rapkin so much.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.698
Are you ever
in the mood

14:25.732 --> 14:29.036
for a spinach
and fried leek "frittoto"

14:29.069 --> 14:30.904
surrounded
by a bed of "rugala..."

14:36.409 --> 14:37.911
(screams)

14:39.146 --> 14:41.881
(phone buzzes)

14:41.915 --> 14:44.484
(video game chimes)
(sighs)

14:50.790 --> 14:53.126
*

15:12.779 --> 15:13.947
(Tallulah fusses)
(sighs)

15:13.981 --> 15:15.882
What's wrong?

15:15.915 --> 15:19.486
In the middle of messaging
all these girls, I just...

15:19.519 --> 15:22.489
started thinking about the
relationship you and I have--

15:22.522 --> 15:24.992
whatever it is--
and how, yeah,

15:25.025 --> 15:27.427
we're just a couple of wild
cards who don't add up to much,

15:27.460 --> 15:31.098
but if nothing else
during this time,

15:31.131 --> 15:33.766
I learned firsthand just...

15:33.800 --> 15:36.236
how absolutely amazing you are.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.005
Me?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.106
Your smile.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.440
(giggles)

15:40.473 --> 15:42.409
The way your eyes catch
fire when you laugh.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.945
I mean, sure, you regularly
get outwitted by dogs,

15:45.979 --> 15:48.415
but that's what makes
you unique. And yeah,

15:48.448 --> 15:50.850
you get Doritos stuck
in your eyebrows sometimes,

15:50.883 --> 15:53.253
but I still want to make out
with you all the time,

15:53.286 --> 15:55.522
because our connection,
despite whatever,

15:55.555 --> 16:00.493
it's true and deep and good.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.496
Now I'd love to see those
beautiful bosoms of yours,

16:03.530 --> 16:05.798
if I might.

16:05.832 --> 16:08.868
Yeah. Okay.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.810
Wouldn't work, huh?

16:17.844 --> 16:19.546
(gasps) You!

16:19.579 --> 16:23.216
You cannot bring that technique
into the world, Edgar.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.817
It's too dangerous.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.320
Mmm.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.888
(exhales)

16:28.921 --> 16:31.124
Whew.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.826
Your Uncle Edgar is a bad man.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.329
He's gonna make all the girls
show him their titties.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.864
(chuckles)

16:37.897 --> 16:39.199
(in baby voice):
I don't know what titties are

16:39.232 --> 16:43.036
because my mommy doesn't
let me suck on hers.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.204
(laughs)

16:44.237 --> 16:46.906
Give me the thing.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.875
(Tallulah cries)

16:52.879 --> 16:54.147
How's the podcast?

16:54.181 --> 16:56.249
I hate Jimmy.
Why is your boob out?

16:56.283 --> 16:57.884
I was showing it to Edgar.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.852
It's not weird.
We're doing it.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.189
What?! Why?! Since when?!

17:02.222 --> 17:04.357
For a while.
Don't worry, we just bang.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.859
And do mouth stuff.
And he loves the booty.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.162
Ew. Ew. Wait.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.531
You don't do it on the couch
where I sleep, do you?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.066
Oh, yeah, all the time.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.001
Oh, that reminds
me, Gretchen,

17:15.034 --> 17:17.404
you should definitely
buy a new pillowcase.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.606
(gags)

17:19.639 --> 17:22.542
"His tongue explored
her inner sanctum

17:22.575 --> 17:24.611
"with varying degrees of fervor,

17:24.644 --> 17:27.580
"whimsy giving way
to desperation.

17:27.614 --> 17:31.050
"On her uncle's farm, Chastity
had seen newborn kittens

17:31.084 --> 17:33.052
"and foals licked clean

17:33.086 --> 17:34.954
by their mothers.
With careful... "

17:34.987 --> 17:36.356
I knew you'd show.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.558
Ugh, did I put
the mustache on crooked?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.560
I'm not reading.
Listen, Jimmy,

17:40.593 --> 17:42.229
I've done my research,
and I know you need this

17:42.262 --> 17:43.563
now more than anything.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.631
It's been a while

17:44.664 --> 17:46.133
since your last
significant paycheck.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.101
House isn't gonna
pay for itself.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.404
This is anathema

17:51.438 --> 17:53.906
to everything I love
about literature.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.976
Genre, groupies, fandom...

17:57.009 --> 17:59.246
I can't really think of
a good analogy right now,

17:59.279 --> 18:03.583
but why pre-judge something
before you've even tried it?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.418
Oh, and amazing news,

18:05.452 --> 18:08.655
People magazine read the book
and they want to do a profile,

18:08.688 --> 18:10.423
because a little white girl
hasn't been murdered in a while,

18:10.457 --> 18:11.691
but that clock is ticking.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.096
Jimmy, I think this book
could really be a thing.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.432
That's why I need you
to get up there.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.434
AUTHOR:
"...with the taste of her."

18:21.468 --> 18:23.936
(applause)

18:23.970 --> 18:25.438
Thank you. Buy the book.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.978
Up next,

18:32.011 --> 18:35.248
we have one of our
most exciting new writers.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.585
A man who can take
a World War II bombing raid

18:38.618 --> 18:43.156
and turn it into a sensual siege
on your entire body.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.691
(murmuring)

18:44.724 --> 18:46.359
Please join me in welcoming

18:46.393 --> 18:49.429
the author of the forth coming,

18:49.462 --> 18:51.698
The Width of a Peach,

18:51.731 --> 18:54.000
Jimmy Shive-Overly.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.712
(microphone feedback)

19:05.745 --> 19:08.147
When I set out to write

19:08.181 --> 19:12.652
the sexiest, erotic
literary novel

19:12.685 --> 19:15.622
since Portnoy's Complaint,

19:15.655 --> 19:18.325
I knew I was going to ruffle
a few feathers.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.726
Take off your pants!

19:19.759 --> 19:21.761
(whooping and applause)

19:35.041 --> 19:38.345
(squeals and whoops)

19:44.784 --> 19:48.421
"Simon stroked himself
gently..."

19:53.393 --> 19:55.662
(sighs)
Becca, we're leaving.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.430
Yo, we getting paid or what?

19:59.065 --> 20:01.534
Becca?

20:06.105 --> 20:07.740
Jesus Christ!

20:10.577 --> 20:13.246
(groans)
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

20:13.280 --> 20:16.048
Tallulah needs you,
and you're passed out drunk.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.285
Yeah! We want our
money, too, bitch.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.620
Eh, what happened?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.555
I'm not dirty.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.557
Drag that deadbeat
out of the shower

20:24.591 --> 20:27.560
and force-feed her coffee
till it shoots out of her butt.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.396
(cries)

20:32.131 --> 20:35.402
LINDSAY:
I guess I didn't realize it,

20:35.435 --> 20:40.072
but I never actually felt love
before in my life.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.108
*

20:43.576 --> 20:45.645
Not real love anyway.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.148
But as I stared at that baby,

20:49.181 --> 20:52.285
I felt my heart swell.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.824
And in that moment, I knew

20:57.857 --> 21:00.493
that even though
the magical feeling came

21:00.527 --> 21:02.762
with the possibility
of one day losing it,

21:02.795 --> 21:06.098
the pain would totally
be worth it.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.301
* When I suckle on your breast

21:08.335 --> 21:10.603
* I am your

21:10.637 --> 21:13.105
* Baby

21:13.139 --> 21:15.775
* Son...

21:15.808 --> 21:18.110
All of my life,

21:18.144 --> 21:21.147
I'd been trying
to resist that feeling,

21:21.180 --> 21:23.182
but I couldn't anymore.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.488
And that knowledge forced me to
really think about my future.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.423
* Saw something light
in the sky *

21:30.457 --> 21:34.861
Because, you see, it was
all too vulnerable, and...

21:34.894 --> 21:38.164
I never want
to feel that way again.

21:38.197 --> 21:42.469
I never want to care about
something that might go away.

21:42.502 --> 21:46.639
So, I choose...

21:46.673 --> 21:50.477
for my job to be my everything.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.845
Just like you, Priscilla.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.647
Just like you.

21:56.383 --> 21:59.151
What the hell are you talking
about? I'm married.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.287
I have two kids
and three stepkids.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.223
Emily is 32,
and we get Botox together.

22:04.256 --> 22:07.660
What? Then why are you
in the office all the time?

22:07.694 --> 22:10.329
Because there's a lot
of work to do.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.532
Oh.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.167
Well, I'm still choosing my job.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.736
Okay, sure, whatever.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.905
Eh, can I have an eggroll now?
I'm starving.

22:18.938 --> 22:19.872
Oh.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.376
(sighing)

22:32.719 --> 22:35.388
Okay.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.863

22:59.879 --> 23:01.881

HOST (on TV): $600.

23:16.295 --> 23:17.296
Mm-hmm?
CONTESTANT: "T."

23:17.329 --> 23:20.232
What are you doing here?

23:20.266 --> 23:21.668
What do you mean?
This is my home.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.971
I never moved out.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.874
You just brought a bunch of my
stuff, unasked, to Lindsay's,

23:27.907 --> 23:30.477
where I happened to be staying
for a little while.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.412
But now I'm back here,

23:33.446 --> 23:37.416
where I already paid rent,
because why wouldn't I be?

23:37.450 --> 23:39.385
I didn't do anything.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.787
You did.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.991
Now, get out of my room.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.663
DJ:

23:50.697 --> 23:52.331
Like if the worst kid
in detention

23:52.364 --> 23:54.300
had sex with a radio station.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.268

comments, or concerns,

23:56.302 --> 23:59.739

23:59.772 --> 24:02.542

24:04.711 --> 24:08.715
* My love is extended

24:09.716 --> 24:13.553
* My love never ended

24:14.721 --> 24:18.791

24:18.825 --> 24:21.694

Hey.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.279
If I buy you a drink,
does that mean you have to
go down on me?

24:40.312 --> 24:42.882
