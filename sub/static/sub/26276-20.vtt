10:28.236 --> 10:29.977
Go.

10:35.025 --> 10:37.114
Whoever shot you has lousy aim.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.203
Actually,
there were two of them.

10:39.247 --> 10:40.770
I was lucky

10:40.814 --> 10:42.511
to get out
of there alive.

10:42.554 --> 10:45.035
I don't suppose you were
at a house in Makakilo today?

10:45.079 --> 10:46.776
[sighs]

10:47.821 --> 10:49.779
You murdered my client.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.520
I had no choice.

10:51.563 --> 10:54.566
I had Dotson hire you
to find Pak Jung Soo.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.046
After you did,

10:56.090 --> 10:57.526
Dotson stashed him somewhere

10:57.569 --> 10:59.789
and tried to change the terms
of our deal.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.182
Where is he?

11:01.225 --> 11:03.097
Pay me my money,
and I'll take you to him.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.535
That's all I have.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.103
Well, then you better find
a way of getting the rest.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.105
There is no rest.
Where is he?!

11:15.065 --> 11:16.806
[gasping]
Don't do it.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.114
Don't do it. Don't!

11:20.157 --> 11:22.682
Why were you after Pak?

11:22.725 --> 11:24.335
He was the architect
of North Korea's attempt

11:24.379 --> 11:27.251
to destabilize the U.S. economy
using counterfeit currency.

11:27.295 --> 11:30.080
You didn't answer my question.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.734
Why did you need him?

11:31.778 --> 11:34.519
It's the same reason I needed
the gold from that sunken ship.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.262
It's the same reason
I betrayed you.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.264
And the guys in Afghanistan.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.232
Wait. Thomas,
what are you doing?

11:51.275 --> 11:52.363
[line ringing]

11:52.407 --> 11:54.539
MAN:
HPD. How may I direct your call?

11:54.583 --> 11:56.759
I need to speak
to Detective Katsumoto.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.413
No. Hang up the phone. Please.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.328
You committed treason!Hang up the phone.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.982
You're going to prison.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.593
Just hear me out, okay? I know
you have no reason to trust me.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.030
You're right. I don't.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.294
Just ask yourself this.

12:10.338 --> 12:13.602
Why would I risk everything
to come here?

12:15.082 --> 12:17.301
I'm done asking questions.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.826
Thomas, please.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.785
I'm ready to tell you the truth,
all of it.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.787
You deserve that.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.223
This is Katsumoto.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.703
But more than that,

12:27.747 --> 12:29.400
I think it's something you need.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.708
Hello? Hello?

12:32.752 --> 12:36.059
Please. Please.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.887
Hello?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.280
[phone beeps]

12:46.287 --> 12:47.984
[phone ringing]

12:48.028 --> 12:49.551
Sorry I can't help you, Magnum.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.727
I haven't even
asked anything yet.It doesn't matter.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.642
It's not a good day. I've got
a doubleheader coming in.

12:53.685 --> 12:54.861
Let me guess.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.384
Two guys from Makakilo,

12:56.427 --> 12:58.255
early 40s, both gunshot wounds.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.344
How'd you know that?

13:00.388 --> 13:02.869
Let's just say it's connected
to why I'm calling you.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.262
Please, Doc, get over here
as quickly as you can.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.307
Why?

13:08.439 --> 13:09.789
I'd rather not say
over the phone.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.791
You know what? For me,
that's usually a red flag.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.837
Hey, I need your help, okay?

13:14.881 --> 13:16.621
Doc, there's no one else
I can turn to.

13:16.665 --> 13:19.320
Look... you're great to me,

13:19.363 --> 13:21.452
and sometimes,
I-I take advantage of that,

13:21.496 --> 13:22.932
and I'm sorry, but right now...

13:22.976 --> 13:24.412
Magnum, you know what?

13:24.455 --> 13:27.284
It's okay.
I'll be there soon.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.330
Appreciate it.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.159
Thank you.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.813
You're not gonna
bleed out and die.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.251
That'd be letting you off
too easy.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.427
That's the only reason
why I'm doing this.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.429
[line ringing]

13:41.472 --> 13:43.561
Rick. Yeah.

13:43.605 --> 13:46.390
Can you and TC get over here
as quickly as possible?

13:46.434 --> 13:49.263
I'll explain
when you get here.

13:49.306 --> 13:51.004
All right.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.006
You said you were gonna
tell me the truth.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.312
I want to know everything.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.575
And start from the beginning.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.578
[pounding on door]

14:03.364 --> 14:04.626
What's going on?

14:04.669 --> 14:07.020
Sounded like some kind
of emergency on the phone.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.760
MAGNUM:
It is.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.501
RICK:
Oh.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.025
What the hell is
she doing here?

14:12.068 --> 14:13.896
She was waiting for me
when I got home.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.463
Lost consciousness
20 minutes ago.

14:15.506 --> 14:16.899
Half the island's
still looking for her.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.422
Wait. This woman is a fugitive?

14:18.466 --> 14:19.902
[sighs]
Earmuffs.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.382
I need two hands here.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.906
Magnum, just saw Rick and
TC pulling up in a hurry.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.169
What's going on? Oh, my God!

14:26.213 --> 14:27.649
What is she doing here?

14:27.692 --> 14:29.651
RICK: Think the
better question is,

14:29.694 --> 14:31.653
why isn't HPD here
to arrest her?

14:31.696 --> 14:33.568
TC:
That woman betrayed us.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.918
Got us sent to hell.
She should be in jail.

14:35.962 --> 14:40.357
Yeah, but... according to her,
she had no choice.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.664
Come on. There's
always a choice.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.927
Not this time.What are you talking about?

14:44.971 --> 14:47.364
You remember Hannah telling us
about her father.

14:47.408 --> 14:48.452
Yeah. He was CIA.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.932
Went missing
years ago.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.760
Presumed dead.He's alive.

14:51.803 --> 14:55.546
Being held prisoner by
a group of ex-CIA spooks.

14:55.590 --> 14:59.942
All dirty. Uh, top of the food
chain is this guy Jason Coburn.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.118
She found out about it
when she was embedded with us,

15:02.162 --> 15:05.861
and the ransom was
a huge hoard of Iraqi gold.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.819
She got intel
on its location,

15:07.863 --> 15:10.170
but that intel came at a price.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.520
Yeah, giving our location
to the Taliban.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.479
Why didn't she just
ask us for help?

15:15.523 --> 15:17.438
'Cause we would have broken
a dozen military laws

15:17.481 --> 15:19.005
and ended up in the brig.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.790
What, so instead, she sells
you out knowing full well

15:21.833 --> 15:24.097
that you're gonna end up
in a Taliban POW camp?

15:24.140 --> 15:26.490
She said she was gonna
use the gold to help get us out.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.362
You know what? That's sweet.
That's really sweet

15:28.405 --> 15:30.190
that she was gonna get us out.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.105
Doesn't change the way
I feel about her.

15:32.148 --> 15:35.282
Yeah. So is that why she's
here-- to ask for forgiveness?

15:35.325 --> 15:37.371
No. Actually, she's here to...

15:37.414 --> 15:39.416
ask for help.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.463
I'm sorry, come again?

15:42.506 --> 15:43.899
When we stopped Hannah
from getting the gold,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.945
she had to find another
way to help her father.

15:45.988 --> 15:49.122
The guy I was hired to find,
Pak Jung Soo, he was it.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.427
Okay? He's a counterfeiter.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.212
He's one of the best
in the world.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.822
He's Hannah's plan B.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.650
So she intended to trade
counterfeit bills

15:55.693 --> 15:56.868
for her father?

15:56.912 --> 15:59.697
She was gonna trade Pak
for her father.

15:59.741 --> 16:04.485
His skill set is worth
far more than that gold.

16:16.584 --> 16:19.108
I went to address you gave me.
No sign of Pak Jung Soo,

16:19.152 --> 16:20.805
but there were
signs of a struggle.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.330
Safe bet Pak was
on the losing end,

16:23.373 --> 16:25.027
'cause he left
his go bag behind.

16:25.071 --> 16:28.813
Phony passport and loose
counterfeit bills inside.

16:28.857 --> 16:31.033
It makes me think Dotson
got the funny money

16:31.077 --> 16:32.426
he paid you with from Pak.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.254
You find anything else
in the apartment?

16:34.297 --> 16:37.170
No. But the lab did find some
foreign DNA at Dotson's house.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.041
The profile's female.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.478
We're running it
through the system now.

16:41.522 --> 16:44.046
When Dotson hired you,
did he mention a girlfriend,

16:44.090 --> 16:45.482
any woman in his life?

16:48.398 --> 16:49.617
No.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.620
Okay.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.492
Hey.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.494
Thanks for listening to me
and staying out of it.

16:57.538 --> 16:58.756
I'll be in touch.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.063
Yeah.

17:01.107 --> 17:04.153
You know you just lied to
a cop to protect the woman

17:04.197 --> 17:06.634
that tried to kill us, twice?

17:06.677 --> 17:08.070

17:08.114 --> 17:12.161
If I turn her in,
her father dies.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.163
She's the only one
trying to save him.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.774
If what she told you
was even true.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.299
Why would she be here
if it wasn't true?

17:19.342 --> 17:20.691
We have to help this man.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.084
You don't even know the man!

17:22.128 --> 17:23.564
Look, he served his country,

17:23.607 --> 17:26.001
he's a prisoner. If anybody
knows how that feels,

17:26.045 --> 17:27.133
it should be us.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.525
Call his people.
Let them help him.

17:28.569 --> 17:29.744
They won't help.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.354
H-He was working on trying

17:31.398 --> 17:34.096
to capture Coburn
and his people covertly.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.707
When they found out about it,
he was disavowed.

17:37.708 --> 17:41.190
You can't be serious
about this, TM.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.584
We got to do something
to help this guy.No.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.716
No, we don't. No, this is
exactly why you don't make

17:45.760 --> 17:48.110
any money as a P.I.What are you talking about?

17:48.154 --> 17:49.764
Because you don't always
have to do the right thing.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.027
Gentlemen, please.This isn't about
doing the right thing.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.551
All right? I-I want to know if
she's been telling the truth

17:54.595 --> 17:56.945
about, about everything.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.606
I don't want
to have to ask why anymore.

18:07.521 --> 18:10.698
Okay? I'm gonna find Pak,
I'm gonna use him as bait

18:10.741 --> 18:12.700
to get her father back.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.832
She is going to prison.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.793
But I can't do it alone.

18:27.715 --> 18:30.283
You won't have to. I'll help.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.811
I'm in, too.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.161
But just so we're clear,
I ain't doing this for her.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.250
Or her father.

to watch your six.

a really, really bad idea.

That's odd.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.981
Dotson normally bought petrol
near his house in Kailua,

19:17.025 --> 19:18.983
but the last purchase was made
at a petrol station

19:19.027 --> 19:20.550
on the North Shore.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.465
Maybe that's where
he's hiding Pak.
Mm.

There's dozens of miles
in every direction.

Can you narrow it down
just a little bit?

19:25.773 --> 19:28.602
Shall I pull a rabbit
out of my ass as well?

Well, considering it's you,
I would not be surprised.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.303
Are you making fun
of me, Thomas?No. Absolutely not.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.262
Quite the contrary, actually.

You just... I don't know,
you're really resourceful.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.136
It's why I made that offer.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.532
Oh, yes, "Higgins and Magnum
Private Investigations."

19:46.794 --> 19:48.056
It's still up for consideration,

19:48.099 --> 19:49.536
I just need a little more time.

[keyboard clicking]

19:57.413 --> 19:59.589
Can I ask you something, Thomas?

20:00.634 --> 20:02.288
What's up?

20:02.331 --> 20:04.290
This...

20:04.333 --> 20:08.337
is about more than
just wanting answers, isn't it?

20:08.381 --> 20:10.470
It goes deeper
than that.

20:10.513 --> 20:13.647
Because if what Hannah
told you was true,

20:13.690 --> 20:15.910
then it means
she really did love you.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.955
And...

20:17.999 --> 20:21.742
she only betrayed you
because she had no other option.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.138
Forgive me if I'm prying.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.662
No, that's fine.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.056
At one point in my life,

20:32.100 --> 20:35.016
I was gonna ask
that woman to marry me.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.018

23:16.220 --> 23:17.700
Why would somebody need that?

Well, the service allows you
to monitor any place on Earth.

to keep an eye on their crops.

I can think Dotson would want

23:45.772 --> 23:47.208
to monitor that bus.
