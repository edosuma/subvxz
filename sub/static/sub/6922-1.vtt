WEBVTT

00:47.130 --> 00:48.881
This is Agent Leland Turbo.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.966
I have a flash transmission
for Agent Finn McMissile.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.971
Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.017
You won't believe what I found out here.

01:00.143 --> 01:04.396
This is bigger than anything we've ever
seen, and no one even knows it exists.

01:04.522 --> 01:08.442
Finn, I need backup, but don't call
the cavalry, it could blow the operation.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.028
- And be careful. It's not safe out here.
- Let's go.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.614
Transmitting my grids now. Good luck.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.316
All right, buddy, we're here.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.401
Right where you paid me to bring you.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.529
Question is, why?

01:53.613 --> 01:56.073
I'm looking for a car.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.825
A car? Ha!

01:57.909 --> 02:01.328
Hey, pal, you can't get any further away
from land than out here.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.080
Exactly where I want to be.

02:03.206 --> 02:07.042
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.628
What are you doing out here?

02:10.713 --> 02:13.340
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.

02:13.424 --> 02:17.344
Well, turn around
and go back where you came from.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.388
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?

02:20.598 --> 02:23.517
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.

02:24.227 --> 02:28.438
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.357
Buddy?

03:32.921 --> 03:36.256
- Incoming.
- All workers report to the loading dock.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.719
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.473
All right, fellas, you know the drill.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.184
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.357
Come on, guys. These crates
aren't gonna unload themselves.

03:53.441 --> 03:57.402
Too many cars here. Out of my way.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.738
Professor Zundapp?

03:59.822 --> 04:02.532
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to
see this before we load it?

04:02.617 --> 04:04.743
Ah, yes. Very carefully.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.120
Oh, a TV camera.

04:07.205 --> 04:10.666
- What does it actually do?
- This camera is extremely dangerous.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.668
What are you up to now, Professor?

04:25.556 --> 04:29.351
This is valuable equipment. Make sure
it is properly secured for the voyage.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.353
- You got it.
- Hey, Professor Z!

04:31.437 --> 04:33.981
This is one of those
British spies we told you about.

04:34.065 --> 04:38.110
Yeah! This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.487
Agent Leland Turbo.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.162
It's Finn McMissile!

04:50.206 --> 04:52.207
He's seen the camera! Kill him!

04:52.667 --> 04:55.460
- All hands on deck!
- All hands on deck!

05:17.150 --> 05:18.150
Whoa!

05:23.072 --> 05:25.073
Waargh!

06:15.875 --> 06:17.375
What?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.724
Get to the boats!

06:57.834 --> 07:00.210
- He's getting away!
- Not for long!

07:35.997 --> 07:37.789
He's dead, Professor.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.541
Wunderbar!

07:39.625 --> 07:43.378
With Finn McMissile gone,
who can stop us now?

07:44.046 --> 07:48.633
Mater -Tow Mater, that's who -
is here to help you.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.180
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.058
I... Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.394
I thought I could make it this time, but...

08:02.899 --> 08:04.858
Smooth like pudding, huh?

08:04.942 --> 08:08.403
- Who am I kidding?
- I'll always be a lemon.

08:08.529 --> 08:12.073
Well, dad-gum, you're leaking oil again.
Must be your gaskets.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.617
Hey, but look on the bright side.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.037
This is your tenth tow this month,
so it's on the house.

08:17.121 --> 08:20.582
You're the only one
that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.002
Don't sweat it. Shoot,
these things happen to everybody.

08:24.086 --> 08:27.422
- But you never leak oil.
- Yeah, but I ain't perfect.

08:27.506 --> 08:30.884
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust
is starting to show through.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.678
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?

08:33.929 --> 08:34.971
Not yet.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.642
He must be crazy excited
about winning his fourth Piston Cup.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.059
Four! Wow!

08:40.186 --> 08:43.813
Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him,
but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,

08:43.940 --> 08:47.192
'cause we got a whole summer's worth
of best friend fun to make up for.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.526
Just me and...

08:49.779 --> 08:51.112
McQueen!

08:51.197 --> 08:53.490
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- McQueen!

08:53.574 --> 08:57.160
- Mater! I'm in no hurry!
- Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!

08:57.286 --> 08:59.120
- Aaah!
- McQueen's back!

08:59.205 --> 09:03.166
- McQueen's back! McQueen's back!
- Aaah! Oooh-hoo! Oooh-hah!

09:03.292 --> 09:04.876
McQueen's back!

09:04.961 --> 09:07.629
Oh, Lightning! Welcome home!

09:07.713 --> 09:11.257
- Good to have you back, honey!
- Congratulations, man.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.634
Welcome home, soldier.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.053
The place wasn't the same without you,
son.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.722
What? Did he go somewhere?

09:17.974 --> 09:21.309
- It's good to be home, everybody.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.312
- Mater!
- McQueen!

09:24.397 --> 09:26.022
Oooh!

09:27.316 --> 09:29.818
Whoooa!

09:30.486 --> 09:32.821
Hey,
how far did you make it this time, Otis?

09:32.947 --> 09:36.825
- Halfway to the county line.
- Ooh, not bad, man!

09:36.951 --> 09:38.535
I know! I can't believe it either!

09:38.619 --> 09:42.497
- McQueen! Welcome back!
- Mater, it's so good to see you.

09:42.581 --> 09:43.832
You too, buddy.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.460
Oh, man, you ain't going to believe
the things I got planned for us!

09:47.545 --> 09:50.380
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!

09:50.923 --> 09:55.343
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.721
Wow.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.223
I can't believe
they renamed the Piston Cup

10:00.349 --> 10:03.476
after our very own Doc Hudson.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.937
I know Doc said these things
were just old cups,

10:06.022 --> 10:10.233
but to have someone else win it
just didn't feel right, you know?

10:13.738 --> 10:17.240
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.

10:20.369 --> 10:23.496
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.

10:23.622 --> 10:26.791
- What you got planned?
- Ho-ho-ho! You sure you can handle it?

10:26.876 --> 10:30.336
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!

10:30.421 --> 10:32.422
I can handle anything.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.257
Er...Mater?

10:34.383 --> 10:37.594
Just remember, your brakes
ain't going to work on these!

10:37.678 --> 10:39.596
- Mater?
- Relax.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.265
These train tracks
ain't been used in years!

10:42.391 --> 10:44.434
Aaaah!

10:44.560 --> 10:46.603
- Aaaah!
- Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go!

10:46.687 --> 10:48.146
Faster!

10:51.400 --> 10:53.610
Ooh. Wow.

10:53.694 --> 10:57.155
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?

10:57.239 --> 10:59.282
This is going to be good!

11:08.417 --> 11:10.668
Did you see that?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.923
Uh-oh.
- This ain't going to be good.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.720
Ha-ha! Boy, this was the best day ever!

11:20.805 --> 11:24.140
And my favorite souvenir,
this new dent.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.852
- Boy, Mater, today was ah...
- Shoot, that was nothing.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.146
Wait till you see
what I got planned for tonight!

11:30.272 --> 11:34.609
Mater, Mater, whoa!
I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.

11:34.693 --> 11:38.029
That's exactly what I was thinkin'.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.533
- No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
- Even better!

11:41.617 --> 11:45.036
You, me and Miss Sally
goin' out for supper.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.330
Mater, I meant it would be
just me and Sally.

11:48.290 --> 11:51.626
- Oh.
- You know, just for tonight.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.712
- Oh...
- We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.756
OK.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.300
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah, sure.

12:00.344 --> 12:03.346
- Y'all go on and have fun now.
- All right, then.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.598
See you soon, amigo.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.648
Ah, this is so nice.

12:13.732 --> 12:16.693
I can't tell you how good it is
to be here alone,

12:16.777 --> 12:18.611
just the two of us, finally.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.114
- You and me.
- Ahem! Good evening.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.074
- Oh!
- My name is Mater,

12:23.159 --> 12:24.701
and I'll be your waiter.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.453
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.581
Mater? You work here?

12:29.665 --> 12:31.541
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?

12:31.625 --> 12:33.376
I snuck in here
when nobody was lookin'

12:33.502 --> 12:36.087
and pretended to be your waiter
so I could hang out with you?

12:36.172 --> 12:40.008
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?

12:40.092 --> 12:43.261
Can I start you two lovebirds off
with a couple of drinks?

12:43.345 --> 12:47.515
- Yes. I'll have my usual.
- You know what? I'll have that, too.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.477
Uh... Right. Your usual.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.696
- Thanks, man.
- Grazie, Guido.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.323
- Guido, what's McQueen's usual?

13:03.574 --> 13:04.657
How should I know?

13:04.742 --> 13:07.785
- Perfect. Give me two of them.
- Quiet! My program's on.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.121
Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...

13:10.206 --> 13:12.040
His story gripped the world.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.459
Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod,

13:14.585 --> 13:18.421
in an attempt to become the first car to
circumnavigate the globe without GPS,

13:18.547 --> 13:21.841
ironically ran out of gas,
and found himself trapped in the wild.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.761
Feared dead,
he emerged 36 days later,

13:24.845 --> 13:28.514
running on a fuel he distilled himself
from the natural elements!

13:28.599 --> 13:30.600
Since then, he's sold his oil fortune,

13:30.893 --> 13:33.645
converted himself from a gas-guzzler
into an electric car

13:33.729 --> 13:36.898
and has devoted his life to finding
a renewable, clean-burning fuel.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.442
Now he claims to have done it
with his allinol.

13:39.526 --> 13:42.070
And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do

13:42.196 --> 13:44.447
he's created a racing competition
like no other,

13:44.573 --> 13:46.449
inviting the greatest champions

13:46.575 --> 13:48.576
to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.745
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.915
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.210
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.

13:57.294 --> 14:01.673
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
"Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.633
And we all know
what happened to them.

14:03.717 --> 14:06.469
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.514
After seeing allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix,

14:09.598 --> 14:13.643
nobody will ever go back
to gasoline again.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.436
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?

14:16.063 --> 14:17.355
And on satellite,
a World Grand Prix competitor

14:17.439 --> 14:20.650
and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.

14:20.734 --> 14:24.195
It is an honor, Signore Dorado,
for you.

14:24.279 --> 14:26.030
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?

14:26.115 --> 14:27.657
Of course we invited him,

14:27.741 --> 14:30.159
but apparently after his very long
racing season

14:30.244 --> 14:32.245
he is taking time off to rest.

14:32.329 --> 14:35.790
The Lightning McQueen would not
have a chance against Francesco.

14:35.874 --> 14:39.043
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.

14:39.128 --> 14:44.007
In miles, that is like...
way faster than McQueen.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.051
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.387
- Am I on? Hello?
- You're on. Go ahead.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.805
- Hello?
- Go ahead.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.475
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.311
That Italian feller
you got on there

14:57.396 --> 14:58.938
can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.

14:59.189 --> 15:02.525
He's the bestest race car
in the whole wide world.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.403
- Uh-oh.
- If he is, how you say,

15:05.487 --> 15:08.406
"the bestest race car,"
then why must he rest? Huh?

15:08.490 --> 15:10.074
'Cause he knows
what's important.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.745
Every now and then he prefers
just to slow down, enjoy life.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.956
Oh! You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!

15:17.041 --> 15:18.791
This is not news to Francesco.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.169
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.879
After two laps, I am out cold.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.173
- That ain't what I meant.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.509
What's going on
over there?

15:28.594 --> 15:31.220
He is afraid of Francesco.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.598
That's that
Italian formula car.

15:33.682 --> 15:37.018
- His name is...
- Francesco Bernoulli.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.479
- No wonder there's a crowd.
- Why do you know his name?

15:39.563 --> 15:42.398
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not ten.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.943
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.613
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.491
- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?

15:51.742 --> 15:54.452
McQueen could drive circles
around you.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.537
Driving in circles is all he can-a do,
no?

15:56.622 --> 15:57.622
No.

15:57.706 --> 16:01.375
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.627
Any time, any track.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.629
Mel, can we move on?

16:04.713 --> 16:06.589
Francesco needs a caller
who can provide

16:06.673 --> 16:09.884
a little more intellectual stimulation,
like a dump truck.

16:09.968 --> 16:13.304
Ha-ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

16:13.388 --> 16:15.598
Hey! Whoa!

16:16.099 --> 16:17.767
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.811
The Lightning McQueen, huh?

16:19.895 --> 16:23.314
I don't appreciate my best friend
being insulted like that.

16:23.398 --> 16:25.942
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!

16:26.026 --> 16:28.319
This is the difference
between you and Francesco.

16:28.403 --> 16:30.655
Francesco knows how good he is.

16:30.781 --> 16:34.075
He does not need to surround himself
with tow trucks to prove it.

16:34.159 --> 16:37.954
Those are strong words
from a car that is so fragile.

16:38.038 --> 16:42.083
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!

16:42.167 --> 16:43.543
Not-a so fast, McQueen!

16:43.627 --> 16:45.837
"Not so fast."
Is that your new motto?

16:45.921 --> 16:49.924
Motto?

16:50.008 --> 16:53.886
This sounds like something that needs
to be settled on the race course.

16:54.012 --> 16:58.099
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.

16:58.225 --> 17:01.435
I would love to,
but my crew is off for the season, so...

17:03.522 --> 17:04.521
Pit stop.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.941
You know what? They just got back.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.568
Deal me in, baby.

17:08.652 --> 17:11.654
- Ka-chow! Yeah.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.701
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.494
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.454
Mater's going to have a blast, though.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.290
You're bringing Mater, right?

17:23.416 --> 17:25.792
You never bring him
to any of your races.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.466
Ah.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.927
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.305
Come on, it will be
the thrill of a lifetime for him.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.390
- Your drink, sir.
- Mater.

17:39.474 --> 17:40.850
I didn't taste it!

17:40.934 --> 17:43.686
How'd you like to come
and see the world with me?

17:43.812 --> 17:46.647
- You mean it?
- Yeah. You got me into this thing.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.608
- You're coming along.
- All right!

17:58.660 --> 18:00.119
Ka-chow!

18:00.704 --> 18:02.121
Ha-ha!

19:15.821 --> 19:16.904
Hey!

19:25.372 --> 19:27.123
Hey, excuse me!

19:27.207 --> 19:29.208
Domo arigato!

19:34.131 --> 19:36.090
- Yeah!

20:01.616 --> 20:05.119
Guido, look. Ferraris and tires.

20:05.203 --> 20:08.205
- Let's go!
- Ho-ho! Look at this.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.500
OK, now, Mater, remember,
best behavior.

20:11.626 --> 20:14.128
- You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
- Mater!

20:14.212 --> 20:15.379
Hey, McQueen! Over here.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.465
- Lewis!
- Hey, man.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.216
- Jeff!
- Hey, Lightning.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.968
Can you believe this party?

20:26.391 --> 20:27.391
Hey.

20:28.643 --> 20:30.853
You done good. You got all the leaves.

20:30.979 --> 20:34.482
- Check out that tow truck.
- Man, I wonder who that guy's with.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.818
Ah... Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

20:38.403 --> 20:40.237
Ho-ho! Good job!

20:40.322 --> 20:43.908
Mater!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.409
You're just realizing that?

20:45.494 --> 20:48.746
Oh-ho! That jet lag really done
a number on you.

20:48.830 --> 20:51.499
Mater, things are different over here.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.628
Which means maybe you should,
you know, act a little different, too.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.506
- Different than what?
- Well, just help me out here.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.217
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?

21:01.301 --> 21:03.177
That's what a tow truck does.

21:03.261 --> 21:04.887
- Yeah, I mean...
- Looky there.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.681
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.

21:07.807 --> 21:10.434
- Mater, no!
- Look at me. I'm helping you already.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.229
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...

21:13.313 --> 21:15.439
Ah, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.359
- Nice to meet you, Francesco.
- Nice to meet you, too.

21:18.443 --> 21:21.278
You are very good-looking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.239
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?

21:23.323 --> 21:25.074
Anything for McQueen's friend.

21:25.158 --> 21:28.494
Miss Sally is going to flip
when she sees this.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.622
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.

21:31.706 --> 21:33.832
- Oooh!
- She's a big fan of yours.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.793
Hey, she has-a good taste.

21:35.877 --> 21:39.296
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".

21:39.381 --> 21:41.715
You're right. She's a huge fan!

21:41.841 --> 21:44.635
She goes on and on
about your open wheels.

21:44.719 --> 21:48.013
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going on and on.

21:48.098 --> 21:51.684
Francesco is familiar
with this reaction to Francesco.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.852
Women respect a car
that has-a nothing to hide.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.479
Yeah, er...

21:55.564 --> 21:57.147
- Let us have a toast.
- Let's.

21:57.232 --> 22:00.192
I dedicate my win tomorrow
to Miss Sally.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.318
Oh. Sorry.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.572
I already dedicated
my win tomorrow to her.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.074
So, if we both do it,
it's really not so special.

22:07.158 --> 22:10.578
- Besides, I don't have a drink.
- I'll go get you one.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.122
Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks
for one of them drinks?

22:13.206 --> 22:16.584
- They're free.
- Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?

22:16.710 --> 22:20.713
I should probably go keep an eye
on him. See you at the race.

22:20.797 --> 22:24.717
Yes, you will see Francesco,
but not like this.

22:24.801 --> 22:28.470
You will see him like-a this
as he drives away from you.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.097
Ha! That's cute.

22:30.181 --> 22:32.474
You had one of those made up
for all the racers?

22:32.601 --> 22:33.726
- No.

22:33.810 --> 22:35.144
Okay.

22:35.228 --> 22:38.731
- Ciao, McQueen!
- He is so getting beat tomorrow!

22:38.815 --> 22:43.444
Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod.

22:43.528 --> 22:47.239
It is my absolute honor
to introduce to you

22:47.324 --> 22:51.327
the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

22:51.786 --> 22:54.204
From Brazil, Number 8...

23:15.310 --> 23:16.977
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.646
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.440
That's because it's air-cooled.

23:21.566 --> 23:25.277
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.404
- I have a message from London.
- Not here.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.406
Try the canapes on the mezzanine.

23:33.411 --> 23:37.081
The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?
What did they learn about the camera?

23:37.165 --> 23:39.333
It appears to be
a standard television camera.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.586
They said if you could get closer
photos next time that would be great.

23:42.670 --> 23:43.962
This was London's message?

23:44.047 --> 23:46.298
Oh, no. No, sir.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.050
The oil platforms you were on,

23:48.134 --> 23:51.095
turns out they're sitting on
the biggest oil reserve in the world.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.429
How did we miss that?

23:52.514 --> 23:54.515
They've scrambled
everyone's satellites.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.767
The Americans discovered it
just before you did.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.770
They placed an agent on that platform
under deep cover.

23:59.896 --> 24:03.065
He was able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

24:03.149 --> 24:04.149
Great.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.610
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?

24:06.694 --> 24:08.112
Nope, not yet.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.906
The American is here tonight
to pass it to you.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.533
He'll signal you when he's ready.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.201
Good, good.

24:15.036 --> 24:16.370
Oh, no.

24:18.206 --> 24:20.124
- What is it?
- Change of plan.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.126
- You're meeting the American.
- What? Me?

24:22.210 --> 24:24.461
Those thugs down there
were on the oil platform.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.547
If they see me,
the mission is compromised.

24:26.673 --> 24:31.718
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.

24:31.803 --> 24:32.845
You are now.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.851
I'll take one of them. Thank you.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.520
Never know which one McQueen
will have a hankering for.

24:44.441 --> 24:48.485
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

24:49.737 --> 24:52.156
- No, no, wasabi.
- Same old same old.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.950
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!

24:59.664 --> 25:02.040
Er...little more, please.
It is free, right?

25:02.125 --> 25:04.251
Keep it coming. A little more.

25:04.335 --> 25:06.003
Come on, let's go. It's free.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.921
You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.632
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

25:12.010 --> 25:13.760
My condolences.

25:13.928 --> 25:16.805
And now our last competitor.

25:16.931 --> 25:20.517
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

25:20.602 --> 25:21.852
Ka-chow!

25:21.936 --> 25:24.605
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod.

25:24.689 --> 25:28.150
I really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.

25:28.234 --> 25:30.611
Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.822
You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism

25:33.907 --> 25:35.032
to this competition.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.205
Somebody get me water! Aah!

25:41.289 --> 25:43.624
Oh, sweet relief. Sweet relief.

25:51.257 --> 25:57.137
Whatever you do,
do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.556
It has turned.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.892
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.

26:01.976 --> 26:04.728
- This is Mater. He's...
- I know him.

26:04.812 --> 26:07.397
This is the bloke that called in
to the television show.

26:07.482 --> 26:10.192
- You're the one I have to thank.
- No, thank you.

26:10.276 --> 26:11.902
This trip's been amazin'.

26:11.986 --> 26:14.404
Ah. He's a little excited, isn't he?

26:14.489 --> 26:17.866
- Mater!
- But wait, I... Oh, shoot.

26:17.992 --> 26:20.202
- Mater.
- Has anyone got a towel?

26:20.328 --> 26:22.829
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

26:22.914 --> 26:27.376
- But I never leak oil. Never.
- Go take care of yourself right now!

26:31.005 --> 26:34.341
Comin' through! Leakin' oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.

26:35.176 --> 26:37.427
I gotta go. Oh, er...

26:40.181 --> 26:41.223
Er...

26:41.307 --> 26:43.308
Sorry, ladies.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.270
I'm leakin'. I never leak. I never leak.

26:46.354 --> 26:49.106
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.

26:49.190 --> 26:52.025
Oh, oh, I never leak. Oooh!

26:52.151 --> 26:54.152
I never leak, I never leak, never...

26:54.237 --> 26:56.196
Wow-wee!

27:01.911 --> 27:03.912
What in the...?

27:14.132 --> 27:15.424
Hey, that tickles!

27:19.762 --> 27:21.346
Waaargh!

27:28.938 --> 27:32.774
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.

27:36.404 --> 27:39.906
OK, so, the American has activated
his tracking beacon.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.575
Roger that. Move in.

27:56.215 --> 27:57.299
Stop! Hey!

28:15.777 --> 28:18.236
- Oh, you've got to be joking.
- What's the problem?

28:18.321 --> 28:20.113
- He's in the loo.
- So, go in!

28:20.239 --> 28:22.908
- I can't go into the men's loo!
- Time is of the essence.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.993
All right.

28:31.417 --> 28:36.421
Oh! Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!

28:38.007 --> 28:40.592
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!

28:40.677 --> 28:42.260
No offense to your makes and models,

28:42.345 --> 28:45.055
but you break down harder
than my cousin Betsy

28:45.139 --> 28:47.015
after she got left at the altar!

28:47.100 --> 28:49.351
What the...? Whoa. Are you OK?

28:49.477 --> 28:51.520
- I'm fine.
- Hey! Tow truck!

28:51.646 --> 28:55.065
We'd like to get to our private business
here, if you don't mind.

28:55.149 --> 28:56.650
Oh, yeah, sorry.

28:56.734 --> 28:59.236
Don't let me get in the way
of your private business.

28:59.320 --> 29:03.073
Oh, a little advice. When you hear
a giggle and see that waterfall,

29:03.157 --> 29:05.075
you best press that green button.

29:05.159 --> 29:07.285
- Thank you.
- It's to adjust the temperature.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.996
- Got it.
- And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.498
Get out of here!

29:11.582 --> 29:15.669
All right, then. And when she starts
gigglin', prepare to be squirted.

29:16.546 --> 29:18.422
'Scuse me, ma'am.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.424
Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.

29:20.508 --> 29:24.177
- This cannot be him.
- Is he American?

29:24.262 --> 29:26.596
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin' to get funky.

29:26.681 --> 29:29.057
- Extremely.
- Then it's him.

29:29.684 --> 29:31.184
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.937
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

29:34.021 --> 29:36.606
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's air-cooled.

29:36.691 --> 29:39.443
Perfect.
Erm...I'm from the Tokyo Station.

29:39.527 --> 29:42.237
'Course, Karmann Ghias
weren't the only ones.

29:42.363 --> 29:46.116
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.535
- Yeah, OK. I get it.
- And before both of them

29:48.619 --> 29:50.328
there's the Type 2 buses.

29:50.413 --> 29:52.581
- My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
- Listen!

29:52.707 --> 29:54.416
Erm... We should find somewhere
more private.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.294
Gee, don't you think that's a little...?

29:57.378 --> 30:00.422
You're right. Impossible to know
which areas here are compromised.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.716
- So, when can I see you again?
- Well, let's see.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.594
- Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
- Got it.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.137
We'll rendezvous then.

30:08.222 --> 30:11.057
- There you are. Where have you been?
- What's a "rendezvous"?

30:11.142 --> 30:12.934
- Er... It's like a date.
- A date?

30:13.019 --> 30:14.436
Mater, what's going on?

30:14.562 --> 30:17.314
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.316
Guido don't believe you.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.444
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.530
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!

30:25.615 --> 30:27.491
See you tomorrow!

30:27.575 --> 30:29.910
Guido still don't believe you.

30:32.121 --> 30:36.041
- I got to admit, you tricked us real good.
- And we don't like being tricked.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.001
- What's so funny?

30:38.085 --> 30:42.214
Well, I was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.

30:44.675 --> 30:48.261
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
I hear this stuff is good for you.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.138
So you think.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.766
Allinol by itself is good for you.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.189
But after microscopic examination

30:59.273 --> 31:01.942
I have found
that it has one small weakness.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.861
When hit with
an electromagnetic pulse,

31:04.946 --> 31:07.948
it becomes extremely dangerous.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.866
Smile for the camera.

31:09.992 --> 31:11.993
Is that all you want? I got a whole act.

31:12.119 --> 31:15.622
You were very interested in this camera
on the oil platform.

31:15.706 --> 31:19.668
Now, you will witness
what it really does.

31:19.794 --> 31:23.380
- Whatever you say, Professor.
- You talked up a lot of cars last night.

31:23.464 --> 31:25.715
- Which one's your associate?
- Your mother.

31:25.800 --> 31:29.386
Oh, no, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.221
Could I start it now, Professor Z?

31:31.305 --> 31:33.390
Go 50% power.

31:34.600 --> 31:39.312
This camera is actually
an electromagnetic pulse emitter.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.314
What about her? Did you give it to her?

31:41.440 --> 31:44.693
The allinol is now heating to a boil,

31:44.819 --> 31:49.698
dramatically expanding, causing the
engine block to crack under the stress,

31:49.824 --> 31:52.242
forcing oil
into the combustion chamber.

31:52.326 --> 31:54.244
How about him? Did you talk to him?

31:55.663 --> 31:57.914
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.

31:58.040 --> 32:01.334
You may be able to,
but after full impact of the pulse...

32:01.460 --> 32:04.921
unfortunately...
there will be nothing to replace.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.049
- How about him?
- Does he have it?

32:12.096 --> 32:14.097
That's him. He's the one.

32:14.515 --> 32:16.433
- Roger that, Professor Z.
- No!

32:16.517 --> 32:17.559
Yes, sir.

32:17.685 --> 32:21.563
We believe the infiltrator has passed
along sensitive information.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.858
I will take care of it
before any damage can be done.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.861
The project is still on schedule.

32:28.154 --> 32:31.531
You will find the second agent
and kill him.

32:42.209 --> 32:45.253
Japan, land of the rising sun,

32:45.338 --> 32:47.881
where ancient tradition
meets modern technology.

32:47.965 --> 32:51.551
Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix.

32:51.677 --> 32:53.929
I'm Brent Mustangburger
with racing legends

32:54.055 --> 32:56.139
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.

32:56.223 --> 32:58.516
There's never been a competition
like this before.

32:58.601 --> 33:01.144
First, allinol, making its debut tonight

33:01.228 --> 33:04.272
as the required fuel
for all these great champions.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.274
Second, the course itself.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.401
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.237
David, how exactly
does this competition work?

33:11.322 --> 33:15.575
All three of these street courses are
classic round-the-house racetracks.

33:15.701 --> 33:17.577
This means that the IMP
and formula cars

33:17.703 --> 33:20.121
should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.999
Look for Francesco Bernoulli,
in particular, to lead early.

33:23.125 --> 33:26.086
And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars,

33:26.170 --> 33:28.588
like Spain's Miguel Camino,
should make up ground

33:28.714 --> 33:30.674
but I doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco

33:30.758 --> 33:33.593
from absolutely running away with it.

33:33.719 --> 33:35.261
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.180
You forget the most important factor...

33:37.264 --> 33:39.182
that early dirt track section
of the course.

33:39.266 --> 33:42.227
The dirt is supposed to be
the equalizer in this race.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.521
French rally car
Raoul CaRoule

33:44.605 --> 33:46.690
is counting on a big boost
through there.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.733
And don't forget
Lightning McQueen.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.443
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,

33:50.569 --> 33:53.196
was one of the greatest
dirt track racers of all time.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.992
In my opinion, McQueen is the best
all-around racer in this competition.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.452
Really, Darrell, you need
to clean your windshield.

33:59.578 --> 34:03.206
You're clearly not seeing this
Francesco's race to lose.

34:03.457 --> 34:06.584
- It's time to find out.
- The racers are locking into the grid.

34:13.801 --> 34:17.469
Speed. I am speed.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.348
Really? You are speed?

34:20.433 --> 34:23.393
Then Francesco is triple speed.

34:23.476 --> 34:27.188
Francesco is triple speed.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.940
Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

34:30.025 --> 34:32.944
It's-a really getting him into the zone.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.989
He is so getting beat today.

35:05.728 --> 35:08.605
- Your suspension sets look good.
- Tire pressure is excellent!

35:08.689 --> 35:11.524
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.

35:20.117 --> 35:23.620
- Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
- It's his cover.

35:23.704 --> 35:26.748
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.249
It must have cost him a fortune.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.461
- But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
- There's probably heat on him.

35:31.545 --> 35:33.463
- Be patient.
- Right, of course.

35:33.547 --> 35:36.716
- He'll signal us when he can.
- Then we find out who's behind all this.

35:36.842 --> 35:41.304
As they head into the palace
hairpin, Francesco builds an early lead.

35:41.388 --> 35:43.890
- Hang on, boys.
- Here comes the dirt.

35:43.974 --> 35:45.558
Slipping and sliding, baby.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.894
McQueen,
it's time to make your move!

35:48.604 --> 35:50.772
Get on the outside
and show 'im what Doc taught you.

35:52.149 --> 35:53.358
10-4, Mater.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.403
Oh, boy! Francesco's brought
to a screeching halt!

35:57.488 --> 36:00.740
Lightning McQueen
is the first to take advantage.

36:01.158 --> 36:04.452
And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.331
- Nice call, Mater.
- Keep it up.

36:08.874 --> 36:10.708
Whoo-hoo!

36:10.960 --> 36:13.920
McQueen looks happier than a roll bar
at a demolition derby!

36:15.589 --> 36:18.716
Everyone's jostling for position
as we hit the asphalt again.

36:18.801 --> 36:21.386
Francesco lost a lot of momentum
in the dirt.

36:26.767 --> 36:30.687
He's got serious work ahead of
him if he wants to get back in this race.

36:30.771 --> 36:34.774
The racers hit the Rainbow
Bridge, with its 360-degree loop.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.747
- It is time.
- Roger that.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.716
- Oh!
- Miguel Camino has blown an engine!

36:59.800 --> 37:03.136
- Very unusual, Darrell.
- He's been so consistent all year.

37:04.805 --> 37:06.556
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?

37:06.640 --> 37:08.892
- The tow truck from the bathroom.
- The bathroom?

37:08.976 --> 37:11.185
The one the American agent
passed the device to.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.646
- What about him?
- He's in the pits!

37:13.731 --> 37:15.315
Not for long.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.819
- Hold on. I think I've got something.
- What is it?

37:19.945 --> 37:21.154
The Pacer from the party last night.

37:21.989 --> 37:25.074
I'm cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks.

37:25.159 --> 37:26.826
Yep. His VIN numbers match.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.828
- Anyone with him?
- He won't be alone.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.749
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.

37:32.833 --> 37:36.669
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...

37:37.087 --> 37:39.047
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?

37:39.173 --> 37:40.757
Get him out of the pits. Now!

37:41.008 --> 37:43.676
Wow! Some of them fellers
is really loud!

37:43.802 --> 37:46.179
- Can you hear me? Over.
- What?

37:46.263 --> 37:48.931
Get out of the pit now! Do you hear me?

37:49.016 --> 37:52.518
Hey. I know you! You're that girl
from the party last night.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.354
You wanna do our date now?

37:54.438 --> 37:57.398
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.442
Smoke from number 10,
Clutchgoneski!

37:59.526 --> 38:00.693
Ha-ha-ha!

38:00.778 --> 38:03.863
There's no time for
messing about! Get out of the pits!

38:03.989 --> 38:07.408
Is there going to be cable where you is
so I can watch the rest of the race?

38:07.534 --> 38:10.703
- You're running out of time!
- They're coming. Get him out of there!

38:10.788 --> 38:13.081
I'm trying. Get out now.

38:13.207 --> 38:17.293
I usually like to have a proper detailin'
done before I meet a lady friend.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.215
Huh?

38:24.677 --> 38:27.679
- Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
- Then this shouldn't hurt.

38:40.275 --> 38:41.734
Miss Shiftwell?

38:41.819 --> 38:44.112
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.572
Multiple assailants
are closing in quickly.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.658
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.995
Hey, new lady friend,
you like flowers?

38:53.080 --> 38:54.080
What?

38:54.164 --> 38:56.666
- No! Don't go in anywhere.
- Just keep moving.

38:56.750 --> 38:58.751
- Stay outside. Got you.
- Outside?

38:59.920 --> 39:02.046
Whoa! McQueen
suddenly moves to the outside.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.217
I cannot believe what I saw.

39:06.301 --> 39:09.137
That was a bonehead move
to open up the inside like that!

39:09.263 --> 39:11.180
That might have cost McQueen
the victory!

39:30.284 --> 39:32.952
This time, I'm going to make sure
you stay dead!

39:34.121 --> 39:36.539
- You're doing brilliantly.
- Now just stay focused.

39:36.623 --> 39:39.083
What's that? You want me
to head toward that ruckus?

39:39.168 --> 39:41.169
No! Don't go down that street.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.467
Ohh!

39:51.972 --> 39:53.014
Hi-yah!

39:53.265 --> 39:55.516
Wow! A live karate demonstration!

39:55.601 --> 39:57.935
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.

40:00.647 --> 40:02.023
Aaargh!

40:05.110 --> 40:06.903
And here they come,
the two leaders.

40:06.987 --> 40:09.322
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!

40:15.370 --> 40:17.538
- It's close!
- Francesco's the winner!

40:17.623 --> 40:19.248
McQueen's number two.

40:21.543 --> 40:24.670
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?

40:31.011 --> 40:32.428
Where'd he go?

40:32.554 --> 40:35.515
Our rendezvous has been
jeopardized. Keep the device safe.

40:35.599 --> 40:39.018
- We'll be in touch.
- Dad-gum, did I miss our date?

40:44.358 --> 40:46.025
- Francesco!
- Francesco, over here.

40:46.151 --> 40:47.652
What was your strategy today?

40:47.736 --> 40:50.530
Strategia?
Francesco needs-a no strategy.

40:50.614 --> 40:51.739
It's-a very simple.

40:51.865 --> 40:55.868
You start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then win.

40:55.994 --> 40:58.287
Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.

40:58.372 --> 41:00.665
You were in trouble
for a while.

41:00.749 --> 41:02.708
That dirt track section
had you crawling.

41:02.793 --> 41:08.005
To truly crush one's dream, you must
first raise their hopes very high.

41:09.383 --> 41:12.218
- Mater!
- Hey, McQueen! What happened?

41:12.302 --> 41:14.345
Is the race over? You won, right?

41:14.429 --> 41:16.806
Why were you yelling at me
while I was racing?

41:16.890 --> 41:20.810
Yelling? Oh, you thought...
That's funny right there.

41:20.894 --> 41:23.187
No, that's 'cause I seen
these two fellers doing

41:23.272 --> 41:25.356
some karate street performance.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.900
It was nutso.
One of 'em even had a flame-thrower.

41:28.026 --> 41:30.444
A flame-thrower?
What are you talking about?

41:30.571 --> 41:33.322
- I don't understand. Where were you?
- Going to meet my date.

41:33.407 --> 41:34.991
Your date?

41:35.075 --> 41:38.119
She started talkin' to me as a voice
in my head, tellin' me where to go.

41:38.245 --> 41:40.329
- What?
- Wait a minute.

41:40.414 --> 41:44.041
- I didn't screw ya up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!

41:44.126 --> 41:46.627
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

41:46.712 --> 41:49.755
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flame-throwers?

41:49.840 --> 41:53.092
This is exactly why I don't bring you
along to these things.

41:53.218 --> 41:55.303
Maybe if I, I don't know,

41:55.429 --> 41:58.639
talk to somebody and explained
what happened, I could help.

41:58.724 --> 42:02.226
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!

42:03.270 --> 42:05.104
Hey, there he is!

42:06.315 --> 42:09.650
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah! What happened?

42:09.735 --> 42:11.694
I made a mistake.

42:11.778 --> 42:14.822
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.

42:17.659 --> 42:21.245
Look, we know what the problem is
and we've taken care of it.

42:23.123 --> 42:26.417
Lightning McQueen loses
in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli

42:26.501 --> 42:28.961
in the first race of the World Grand Prix.

42:29.087 --> 42:31.839
And three - count 'em -
three cars flamed out

42:31.965 --> 42:35.468
leaving some to suggest that their fuel,
allinol, might be to blame.

42:35.761 --> 42:39.096
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.

42:39.181 --> 42:42.642
There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out.

42:42.726 --> 42:46.145
The jury may still be out on whether
allinol caused these accidents,

42:46.271 --> 42:47.563
but one thing's for sure,

42:47.689 --> 42:50.149
Lightning McQueen blew this race.

42:50.275 --> 42:52.860
Team McQueen
can't be happy right now.

43:01.745 --> 43:05.373
Welcome to
Tokyo International Airport.

43:23.975 --> 43:26.852
- Come with me, please, sir.
- But I'm 'onna miss my plane.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.730
- Right this way.
- Ah, doggone it.

43:29.815 --> 43:31.691
This is about my hook, ain't it?

43:31.775 --> 43:34.694
I know I should have checked it,
but I can't, really.

43:34.778 --> 43:37.238
Look. It's attached to me.

43:37.364 --> 43:40.700
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.

43:40.784 --> 43:43.035
I never properly introduced myself.

43:43.161 --> 43:45.538
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.

43:45.622 --> 43:48.499
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.

43:48.583 --> 43:51.210
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?

43:51.336 --> 43:54.338
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.

43:54.423 --> 43:56.632
I know some karate.

43:56.758 --> 44:00.261
I don't want to brag or nuttin',
but I got me a black fan belt.

44:00.387 --> 44:03.305
- Wanna see some moves I made up?
- You're being followed.

44:03.390 --> 44:06.267
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood

44:06.393 --> 44:09.145
pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he stalls.

44:09.229 --> 44:13.357
I call it, "What I accidentally did
to my friend Luigi once."

44:13.442 --> 44:15.151
Hey! Hi-yah-pah!

44:15.235 --> 44:17.236
- Hi-yah!
- There he is!

44:18.071 --> 44:20.072
Hi-hi-tah! Huh!

44:21.032 --> 44:23.784
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.

44:23.869 --> 44:26.078
- Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
- Whoa!

44:26.204 --> 44:27.872
Hang on!

44:29.040 --> 44:31.208
Whoa-hah-hah!

44:31.293 --> 44:33.502
This is first-class service.

44:33.587 --> 44:36.213
You don't even have to go
through the terminal!

44:37.758 --> 44:39.842
Your karate partners is back there.

44:39.926 --> 44:42.136
They look like
they tryin' to catch up!

44:42.220 --> 44:44.722
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!

44:47.392 --> 44:49.643
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

44:59.446 --> 45:01.447
Whoa...

45:07.954 --> 45:09.413
Is everything okay back there?

45:09.498 --> 45:11.582
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.

45:11.666 --> 45:13.417
Roger that.

45:15.295 --> 45:18.464
'Member that whole thing about me
not stoppin' no matter what?

45:23.678 --> 45:25.137
I knew I shoulda done carry-on!

45:25.222 --> 45:27.223
Thanks, old boy.

45:27.307 --> 45:29.558
- You got it, mate.
- Hey, doggonit!

45:29.643 --> 45:31.560
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!

45:31.645 --> 45:33.229
Come on! Get in here!

45:33.313 --> 45:37.024
I tell you what, you really do
want this first date, don't ya?

45:37.108 --> 45:39.151
That's a no-quit attitude right there.

45:39.277 --> 45:40.653
What the...?

45:43.490 --> 45:45.658
- Aargh!
- Hold on, Sid.

45:55.293 --> 45:56.293
Aargh!

46:03.343 --> 46:05.469
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!

46:09.891 --> 46:11.892
Hold on!

46:13.937 --> 46:18.232
By the time you read this, I will
be safely on an airplane flying home.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.442
I'm so sorry for what I did.

46:20.569 --> 46:23.654
"I don't want to be
the cause of you losing any more races."

46:23.738 --> 46:27.283
"I want you to go prove to the world
what I already know."

46:27.367 --> 46:30.744
"That you are the greatest race car
in the whole wide world."

46:30.871 --> 46:33.289
"Your best friend, Mater."

46:33.373 --> 46:35.374
- I didn't really want him to leave.

46:35.500 --> 46:37.793
Wait, there's more here.

46:37.919 --> 46:40.629
"PS. Please tell the hotel"

46:40.714 --> 46:42.923
"I didn't mean to order that movie."

46:43.049 --> 46:47.678
"I thought it was just a preview
and I didn't realize I was paying for it."

46:47.762 --> 46:50.931
"PPS. That's funny right there. PP."

46:51.016 --> 46:53.726
There are a few more pages
of PS's here.

46:53.810 --> 46:57.396
Well, at least I know
if he's at home, he'll be safe.

46:59.566 --> 47:01.483
That's how I like to start the day.

47:01.568 --> 47:04.236
You never feel more alive
than when you're almost dead.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.322
Yeah.
I hope that device didn't fall off.

47:06.406 --> 47:07.656
Whoa!

47:07.741 --> 47:10.409
That's the closest I ever been
to missin' my flight.

47:10.535 --> 47:12.119
That was... Oh!

47:12.829 --> 47:15.998
- Still in one piece? Great.
- I've got to go to a doctor.

47:16.124 --> 47:18.500
I get these sharp pains
in my undercarriage.

47:18.585 --> 47:21.754
- Downloading the photo now.
- Let me introduce you two.

47:21.838 --> 47:23.839
This here is Finn McSomethin'
or other.

47:23.924 --> 47:26.800
He's a first-class VIP
airport whatchamacallit.

47:27.510 --> 47:30.179
And, Finn, this here is my date.

47:30.263 --> 47:31.931
I never did get your name.

47:32.015 --> 47:34.767
Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

47:34.851 --> 47:36.518
It's Shiftwell. Holley...

47:38.104 --> 47:40.940
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.

47:41.608 --> 47:43.442
What is this?

47:43.526 --> 47:46.195
That's one of the worst engines
ever made.

47:46.321 --> 47:50.991
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

47:51.117 --> 47:54.328
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what.

47:54.412 --> 47:56.205
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.

47:56.289 --> 47:58.958
Yes, OK, but whose engine is this?

47:59.042 --> 48:01.585
It's kinda hard to tell from this picture,
ain't it?

48:01.670 --> 48:03.253
- But you took it.
- Holley.

48:03.338 --> 48:05.339
Oh. Right! Yes, of course.

48:05.423 --> 48:08.550
A good agent gets what he can,
then gets out before he's killed.

48:08.635 --> 48:11.720
Agent? You mean, like,
insurance agent? Like...

48:11.805 --> 48:16.183
Like a good neighbor,
Mater is there!

48:16.434 --> 48:19.478
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!

48:19.562 --> 48:22.648
In how many makes and models
did this type of engine appear?

48:22.774 --> 48:26.318
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period.

48:26.403 --> 48:29.780
At least 35,000 cars were made
with this engine.

48:29.864 --> 48:32.074
- You're purty.
- Yes, thank you.

48:32.200 --> 48:35.369
- And so nice.
- Just pay attention.

48:35.870 --> 48:37.871
This seems like a dead end.

48:38.790 --> 48:42.584
If there was something in the photo that
could narrow this down, I'd be happier.

48:42.669 --> 48:45.421
You might not be happy,
but I bet this feller is.

48:45.505 --> 48:47.840
See how he's had most of his parts
replaced?

48:47.924 --> 48:49.800
And see all them boxes over there?

48:49.884 --> 48:52.928
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.

48:54.013 --> 48:55.889
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.

48:56.015 --> 48:57.599
Exactly.

48:57.684 --> 49:00.519
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.

49:00.603 --> 49:04.314
I know of a black-market parts dealer
in Paris, a treacherous lowlife,

49:04.399 --> 49:07.985
but he's the only car in the world
who can tell us whose engine this is.

49:08.069 --> 49:11.739
What would you say to setting up
an informal task force on this one?

49:11.865 --> 49:12.906
Wait. What?

49:13.032 --> 49:15.200
You obviously have experience
in the field.

49:15.285 --> 49:17.536
Yeah, I live right next to one.

49:18.079 --> 49:19.663
I don't know.

49:19.748 --> 49:22.624
I ain't exactly been much help
to anybody recently.

49:22.709 --> 49:24.835
You're helping me.
Please, Mater.

49:25.420 --> 49:27.045
Well... Okay.

49:27.130 --> 49:29.298
But you know
I'm just a tow truck, right?

49:29.382 --> 49:32.676
Right. And I'm just
in the import-export business.

49:32.844 --> 49:34.470
- Siddeley?
- Yes, Finn?

49:34.554 --> 49:36.013
Paris. Tout de suite.

49:36.097 --> 49:38.682
Yeah, two of them sweets for me,
too, Sid.

49:38.767 --> 49:40.726
I always wanted to be a spy.

49:40.852 --> 49:42.478
Really? Me, too.

49:42.562 --> 49:45.564
- Afterburners, sir?
- Is there any other way?

50:06.169 --> 50:07.503
Ha ha ha!

50:16.262 --> 50:18.180
Once we're inside, stay close.

50:18.306 --> 50:21.600
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.

50:21.726 --> 50:22.976
Got it.

50:23.102 --> 50:25.020
Don't talk to anyone,
don't look at anyone,

50:25.104 --> 50:27.981
and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?

50:28.107 --> 50:29.942
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.

50:30.777 --> 50:32.694
- Mater?
- Yeah, Finn?

50:32.779 --> 50:35.948
- We're not here to go shopping.
- Shoppin'? What do you mean?

50:36.032 --> 50:37.908
Why would I...

50:37.992 --> 50:39.535
Dad-gum.

50:39.619 --> 50:42.621
- Part for sales, monsieur.
- Monsieur, part for sale.

50:42.705 --> 50:44.623
They got everything here. No!

50:44.749 --> 50:47.084
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.

50:47.168 --> 50:48.877
Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!

50:51.005 --> 50:53.799
Wow. Whoa. He-he!

50:54.425 --> 50:56.426
Do what?

50:57.428 --> 51:00.138
Excuse me. What are you selling?

51:00.306 --> 51:02.015
Headlights, monsieur, headlights?

51:02.141 --> 51:03.892
- What in the...?
- Two for one.

51:03.977 --> 51:05.602
- I give you good price!
- I'm good!

51:10.483 --> 51:13.735
- There you are.
- There is some great bargains here.

51:13.820 --> 51:15.821
- Mater, get back!
- Imbecile!

51:23.037 --> 51:24.413
Hey, wait for me!

51:41.514 --> 51:42.598
Ahhhhhh!

51:47.645 --> 51:49.146
Ag-g-g-h!

51:49.230 --> 51:51.481
- Have you lost your mind?
- But I thought...

51:51.566 --> 51:53.609
This chap needs a tow.
Hook him up.

51:53.693 --> 51:55.694
Sure thing.

51:56.279 --> 51:59.197
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!

52:07.707 --> 52:09.625
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?

52:09.709 --> 52:13.587
This is her first field assignment. She
didn't know you were my informant.

52:13.671 --> 52:15.672
- Informant?
- A rookie, huh?

52:16.007 --> 52:17.591
I never liked new car smell.

52:18.593 --> 52:21.470
Tomber was doing 20-to-life
in a Moroccan impound

52:21.554 --> 52:24.431
the first time I saved him,
if I recall correctly.

52:24.557 --> 52:28.185
Speaking of recalls, you're getting up
there in mileage, aren't you?

52:28.269 --> 52:31.271
All right, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old.

52:31.397 --> 52:34.274
So, here you go, informant.
Inform us.

52:35.234 --> 52:37.569
Beuck!
That is the worst motor ever made.

52:38.613 --> 52:41.949
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.

52:42.075 --> 52:44.117
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?

52:44.243 --> 52:46.203
They should. I sold them.

52:46.287 --> 52:47.788
- To whom?
- No idea.

52:47.914 --> 52:51.333
He's my best customer, but he always
does his business over the phone.

52:51.709 --> 52:54.836
I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts.

52:54.921 --> 52:56.171
Now I know.

52:56.422 --> 52:58.840
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin' truer than that.

52:58.967 --> 53:02.010
- Lemon?
- Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.

53:02.095 --> 53:04.179
Lemons is a tow truck's
bread and butter.

53:04.263 --> 53:07.099
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers
we run into at the party

53:07.183 --> 53:08.767
and the race and the airport.

53:08.851 --> 53:10.852
Pull up the pictures
from the oil platform.

53:10.937 --> 53:13.355
I want to know what other type of cars
were out there.

53:13.439 --> 53:17.150
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.

53:17.276 --> 53:18.944
Are these cars considered lemons?

53:19.112 --> 53:20.988
Is the Popemobile Catholic?

53:21.072 --> 53:25.033
Everyone involved in this plot
is one of history's biggest loser cars.

53:25.118 --> 53:28.203
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.

53:28.663 --> 53:31.206
- Ah. This explains it.
- What, Tomber?

53:31.374 --> 53:34.876
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo
and Trunkov never get together,

53:34.961 --> 53:37.546
but they are having a secret meeting
in two days.

53:37.630 --> 53:40.799
- Where's this meeting taking place?
- Porto Corsa, Italy.

53:40.883 --> 53:42.509
That's where the next race is!

53:42.635 --> 53:45.387
There's a good chance
our mystery engine will be there, too.

53:45.471 --> 53:47.431
Your chances are more than good.

53:47.515 --> 53:51.143
I just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday. To Porto Corsa.

53:51.728 --> 53:54.771
Contact Stevenson
and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon.

53:54.856 --> 53:56.189
Good work.

54:01.154 --> 54:05.073
That three-wheeled feller
had to be right about a big meetin'.

54:05.158 --> 54:08.618
You never see this many lemons
in one town.

54:09.245 --> 54:11.079
'Less there's a swap meet.

54:11.164 --> 54:12.914
How'd you get all them pictures?

54:13.041 --> 54:16.710
I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light
cameras to do recognition scans.

54:17.295 --> 54:21.840
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car
I ever met, but you're the smartest, too.

54:21.924 --> 54:23.842
Thank you...I think.

54:23.926 --> 54:27.471
- That's a familiar sight.
- A Hugo being towed.

54:27.555 --> 54:29.347
But he looks absolutely perfect!

54:29.474 --> 54:32.476
Of course! They must be the heads
of the lemon families.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.479
Makes sense. If I was rich
and broke down every day,

54:35.563 --> 54:37.898
I'd hire me to tow me
around all the time, too!

54:37.982 --> 54:41.902
We've got to infiltrate that meeting
to find out who's behind all this.

54:41.986 --> 54:44.488
- Hang on a minute. Hold still.
- Ow!

54:50.745 --> 54:52.746
Ah-ha. Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

54:52.914 --> 54:54.164
Thank you, Finn.

54:54.248 --> 54:56.083
Boy, I sure wish my friends
could see me now.

55:02.548 --> 55:04.966
Guido,
your eyes do not deceive you.

55:05.051 --> 55:08.095
We are in Italy. We are home.

55:08.513 --> 55:11.389
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?

55:11.516 --> 55:15.685
What? No friend of mine
will stay in a hotel in-a my village.

55:15.770 --> 55:19.564
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino-o-o-o!

55:19.732 --> 55:22.484
Luigi! Guido!

55:32.745 --> 55:34.621
How do they do it?

55:34.747 --> 55:38.041
These are the same ingredients
as back home, but it tastes so good.

55:38.126 --> 55:40.961
- It's organic, man.
- Treehugger.

55:43.965 --> 55:45.841
Hey, race car.

55:45.925 --> 55:47.884
You look so down, so low.

55:47.969 --> 55:49.886
Is like you have flat tires.

55:54.433 --> 55:56.143
She said you look like you are starving,

55:56.269 --> 55:58.770
that she's gonna make you a big meal
and fatten you up.

55:58.855 --> 56:00.021
Oh, no.

56:00.106 --> 56:03.108
Mama Topolino, please,
you don't need to make a fuss.

56:03.651 --> 56:05.360
Capisco. I understand.

56:05.444 --> 56:08.280
Is a problem, yes,
between you and a friend?

56:08.656 --> 56:09.823
How did you know that?

56:09.907 --> 56:13.118
A wise car hears one word
and understands two.

56:14.620 --> 56:15.704
That, and Luigi told me.

56:17.290 --> 56:19.958
While Mama cooks,
come and take a stroll with me.

56:20.042 --> 56:22.377
I brought my friend Mater along
on the trip

56:22.461 --> 56:24.713
and I told him he needed
to act different,

56:24.797 --> 56:26.381
that we weren't in Radiator Springs.

56:26.465 --> 56:28.466
This Mater is a close friend?

56:28.885 --> 56:30.635
He's my best friend.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.180
Then why would you ask him to be
someone else?

56:37.977 --> 56:39.561
What did I do?

56:39.645 --> 56:41.605
I said some things during our fight.

56:41.689 --> 56:44.733
You know, back when Guido and Luigi
used to work for me,

56:44.817 --> 56:47.694
they would fight over everything.

56:48.154 --> 56:51.531
They fight over what Ferrari
was the best Ferrari,

56:51.782 --> 56:54.492
which one of them looked
more like a Ferrari.

56:54.577 --> 56:56.995
There were even
some non-Ferrari fights.

56:57.955 --> 57:00.582
So I tell them, "Va bene,
it's OK to fight."

57:01.167 --> 57:04.920
"Everybody fights now and then,
especially best friends."

57:05.796 --> 57:07.547
"But you got to make up fast."

57:07.673 --> 57:10.217
"No fight more important
than friendship."

57:19.185 --> 57:23.605
- What does that mean?
- Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.

57:23.731 --> 57:25.690
Now, mangia. Eat!

57:37.370 --> 57:39.454
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

57:39.538 --> 57:41.289
Thank you, Stevenson.

57:41.374 --> 57:43.708
- That should just about do it.
- Perfect.

57:43.793 --> 57:46.461
So, Mater, it's voice-activated.

57:46.545 --> 57:49.339
But everything's voice-activated
these days.

57:49.423 --> 57:52.759
What? I thought you was supposed
to be makin' me a disguise.

57:52.843 --> 57:55.595
- Voice recognized.
- Disguise program initiated.

57:56.222 --> 57:57.305
Cool!

57:57.390 --> 57:59.391
Computer, make me a German truck.

57:59.558 --> 58:02.602
- Request acknowledged.
- Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.

58:02.728 --> 58:03.853
Make me a monster truck!

58:03.938 --> 58:05.855
- Request acknowledged.
- What the...?

58:05.940 --> 58:08.233
I vant to siphon your gas!

58:09.068 --> 58:11.319
- Now make me a taco truck!
- Request acknowledged.

58:13.447 --> 58:15.907
- A funny car!
- Request acknowledged.

58:18.160 --> 58:21.204
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.

58:21.289 --> 58:23.581
So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.

58:23.666 --> 58:26.459
- And leave the rest to us.
- Now, hold still.

58:26.585 --> 58:28.420
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.

58:32.591 --> 58:34.592
That's no good. Hm.

58:37.596 --> 58:39.097
Hey. What are you doin'?

58:39.223 --> 58:43.101
The disguise won't calibrate effectively
without a smooth surface to graft onto.

58:43.185 --> 58:46.104
For a second there, I thought
you was tryin' to fix my dents.

58:46.188 --> 58:48.565
- Yes, I was.
- Then, no, thank you.

58:48.649 --> 58:52.527
I don't get them dents buffed,
pulled, filled or painted by nobody.

58:53.654 --> 58:56.031
- They way too valuable.
- Your dents are valuable? Really?

58:56.115 --> 59:00.201
I come by each one of 'em with
my best friend, Lightning McQueen.

59:00.286 --> 59:03.830
I don't fix these.
I wanna remember these dents forever.

59:03.956 --> 59:09.294
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.

59:09.420 --> 59:12.380
Friendships can be dangerous
in our line of work, Mater.

59:12.465 --> 59:14.507
But my line of work
is towin' and salvage.

59:14.633 --> 59:17.677
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's
is designing iPhone apps.

59:17.803 --> 59:21.139
- No, I meant for real.
- It's OK. I'll work around the dent.

59:21.265 --> 59:23.683
- Oh...
- In the meantime...

59:25.561 --> 59:27.520
..you look a little light on weapons.

59:36.113 --> 59:38.865
You are looking live
at beautiful

59:38.949 --> 59:41.284
Porto Corsa, Italy,
on the Italian Riviera.

59:41.369 --> 59:46.414
What a magnificent setting for the
second race of the World Grand Prix!

59:46.499 --> 59:49.376
Brent, they call this place
the "Gem of the Riviera,"

59:49.460 --> 59:51.086
and it's easy to see why.

59:51.170 --> 59:53.922
With its secluded beaches
and opulent casinos,

59:54.006 --> 59:56.841
Porto Corsa truly is a playground
for the wealthy.

59:56.926 --> 59:59.177
And everyone who's anyone
is here today,

01:00:00.012 --> 01:00:02.055
from the ultra-rich and super-famous

01:00:02.139 --> 01:00:04.516
to world leaders
and important dignitaries.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.351
You aren't kidding, David.

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:09.729
You can't do a three-point turn
without bumping into some celebrity.

01:00:09.855 --> 01:00:12.315
Welcome, everyone, to the second race
of the World Grand Prix,

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.860
where the big news
continues to be allinol.

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:18.780
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press
earlier today

01:00:18.864 --> 01:00:21.116
to answer questions about its safety.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.910
An independent panel of scientists
has determined

01:00:23.994 --> 01:00:26.037
that allinol is completely safe, okay?

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.622
Safe. There it is.

01:00:27.748 --> 01:00:29.374
So the race will go on, folks.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.209
But the question everyone is asking:

01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:34.003
Will the real
Lightning McQueen show up today?

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:37.132
- He'd better.
- Talk about a home track advantage.

01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:40.093
Francesco Bernoulli
grew up racing on this course.

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:45.098
Signore e signori, in the
pole position, Numero Uno, Francesco!

01:00:45.182 --> 01:00:48.309
Bellissima!
Thank you for your support!

01:00:48.394 --> 01:00:50.353
And your big mistake, McQueen!

01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:52.939
In secondo position,

01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:57.652
numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!

01:00:58.237 --> 01:01:00.196
McQueen-a, is-a everything OK?

01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:04.159
If you're worried about your fuel, man,
don't. It's perfectly safe.

01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:07.745
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.789
Francesco understands, McQueen.

01:01:09.874 --> 01:01:11.833
Oh, great, here it comes.

01:01:11.917 --> 01:01:13.877
What do you got, Francesco?

01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:17.255
For famous race cars like Francesco
and, well, you,

01:01:17.381 --> 01:01:20.341
to be far away from home is not easy.

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:23.553
I think you forgot
the insulting part of that insult.

01:01:23.637 --> 01:01:25.180
Is-a no insult.

01:01:25.264 --> 01:01:28.266
When-a Francesco is away from home,
he misses his mama,

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:31.186
just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:34.272
Gee, I maybe misjudged you,
because that's exactly...

01:01:34.398 --> 01:01:38.568
Of course, I am at home,
and my mama is right here.

01:01:38.652 --> 01:01:40.528
Mama!

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:44.699
Don't worry, Mama,
McQueen is very sad.

01:01:44.825 --> 01:01:47.202
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!

01:01:47.286 --> 01:01:51.372
And there's the insult we were missing.

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:09.974
Darrell, the racers
are settling in as they head

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.392
to the Italian countryside.

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:13.394
Whoo, boy!

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:16.064
This is gonna be a great race.

01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:31.246
Gremlins.
Man, those are some ugly cars.

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:33.414
Look like someone stole their trunks.

01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:40.630
My grand-a father has-a broken down.

01:02:40.714 --> 01:02:44.551
If-a one of-a you would help,
I would be so thankful.

01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:47.679
Sounds like you need
some roadside assistance.

01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:50.014
- She was talking to me.
- Really? Prove it.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.058
Don't-a fight over me.

01:02:52.142 --> 01:02:55.019
SignoreTow Truck, per favore.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:58.022
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.

01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:02.277
I don't know about this.
What if I screw things up?

01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:03.903
Impossible.

01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:05.989
Just apply the same level of dedication

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:09.576
you've been using to play
the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.

01:03:09.702 --> 01:03:13.955
It's just that them guys look purty tough
and... Wait, did you say "idiot"?

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:17.125
- Is that how you see me?
- That's how everyone sees you.

01:03:17.209 --> 01:03:18.626
Isn't that the idea?

01:03:18.711 --> 01:03:20.670
I tell you, that's the genius of it.

01:03:20.754 --> 01:03:22.797
No one realizes they're being fooled

01:03:22.923 --> 01:03:25.508
because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.

01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:27.135
Brilliant!

01:03:30.222 --> 01:03:32.307
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I er...

01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:35.268
- Come on! There's no time! Go!
- OK. OK.

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:38.396
- Computer, disguise!
- Request acknowledged.

01:03:43.694 --> 01:03:46.487
It's the boss. He's coming.

01:03:52.369 --> 01:03:53.411
Ivan.

01:03:54.413 --> 01:03:56.039
Oh, er...

01:03:56.123 --> 01:04:00.585
Ivan, why do you insult me so
by making me wait here?

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.428
He's in.

01:04:12.931 --> 01:04:15.600
The racers are now
making their way around the hairpin

01:04:15.726 --> 01:04:18.436
and headed downhill
toward the casino bridge.

01:04:34.828 --> 01:04:36.454
No more bets, please.

01:04:36.538 --> 01:04:38.081
Come on, fuzzy dice!

01:04:38.165 --> 01:04:40.124
- Number four. Easy four.
- Yeah!

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:42.168
Air freshener. Antenna balls.

01:04:42.252 --> 01:04:44.045
Spark-a plugs.

01:04:44.129 --> 01:04:46.547
This place looks like
it's made outta gold!

01:04:46.632 --> 01:04:49.884
- That's because it is.
- Now, be careful what you say.

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:51.969
Why is that?

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:54.013
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?

01:04:54.098 --> 01:04:56.474
You want me to stop talkin' to ya
right now?

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.559
You are acting strange today, Ivan.

01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:02.230
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

01:05:02.314 --> 01:05:05.566
"Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex."

01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:07.568
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.

01:05:07.653 --> 01:05:11.697
But that makes sense, seein's how
you's wanted in France, Germany...

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:13.157
Mater, stop it!

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:15.201
OK, OK, keep your voice down!

01:05:15.285 --> 01:05:17.245
You gonna make me arrested!

01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:19.831
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.

01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:21.666
He's so good!

01:05:23.168 --> 01:05:24.669
Victor!

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:27.380
Hey, Victor!

01:05:27.673 --> 01:05:29.424
- There you are!
- Come in!

01:05:29.508 --> 01:05:33.636
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.513
It's good to see you.

01:05:35.597 --> 01:05:37.390
Is the big boss here yet?

01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:40.643
- No, not yet.
- He's supposed to be here any minute.

01:05:44.523 --> 01:05:46.524
Here we go.

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:50.236
Guten Tag.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.321
It's just the professor.

01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:54.031
Zundapp! When is he coming?

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.033
He's already here.

01:05:58.203 --> 01:06:00.455
Welcome, everyone.

01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:03.749
I wish I could be with you
on this very special day,

01:06:03.876 --> 01:06:05.877
but my clutch assembly broke.

01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:08.087
- You know how it is.
- Forget about it.

01:06:08.172 --> 01:06:09.797
We know how you feel.

01:06:09.882 --> 01:06:12.091
- Descramble that voice.
- I'm trying.

01:06:12.176 --> 01:06:14.302
Oh, it's too sophisticated.

01:06:14.386 --> 01:06:16.387
We are here to celebrate.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:18.890
Today, all your hard work pays off.

01:06:19.975 --> 01:06:22.685
The world turned their backs
on cars like us.

01:06:22.769 --> 01:06:26.230
They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts.

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:30.776
The only thing they haven't stopped
doing is laughing at us.

01:06:31.528 --> 01:06:35.865
Jalopy, rust bucket, heap,

01:06:36.408 --> 01:06:40.119
clunker, junker, beater,
wreck, rattletrap,

01:06:41.455 --> 01:06:42.747
lemon.

01:06:42.873 --> 01:06:46.209
But their insults just give us strength.

01:06:46.293 --> 01:06:51.506
Because today, my friends,
that all ends!

01:06:52.674 --> 01:06:54.759
There's smoke
on the casino bridge!

01:06:54.885 --> 01:06:55.885
Oh, no!

01:06:55.969 --> 01:06:57.595
It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car!

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:04.477
- What just happened?
- I'm working on it.

01:07:06.438 --> 01:07:10.274
They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.

01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:15.613
- Another crash!
- It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.

01:07:16.281 --> 01:07:17.990
Embrace your inner lemon.

01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:19.700
Let it drive you.

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:23.246
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.

01:07:27.167 --> 01:07:29.043
- Finn, it's the camera.
- Where?

01:07:29.169 --> 01:07:30.962
On the tower!

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.343
This was meant to
be alternative fuel's greatest moment.

01:07:37.427 --> 01:07:41.264
But after today,
everyone will race back to gasoline.

01:07:41.348 --> 01:07:44.809
And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.604
will become the most powerful cars
in the world!

01:07:49.189 --> 01:07:50.731
Get out of the way!

01:08:25.934 --> 01:08:30.020
They will come to us, and they will have
no choice, because they will need us.

01:08:37.321 --> 01:08:38.696
Huh? Whoa!

01:08:39.531 --> 01:08:41.532
We figured you might stop by!

01:08:44.243 --> 01:08:46.871
And they will finally respect us!

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:48.997
So hold your hoods high!

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:52.335
After today, you will never again
be ashamed of who you are!

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:55.087
No!

01:08:55.212 --> 01:08:57.381
Long live lemons!

01:08:58.508 --> 01:09:00.885
- Number 7 is loose!
- Shu Todoroki!

01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:26.077
Finn?

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.537
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!

01:09:29.622 --> 01:09:31.665
McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second!

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.709
They have no idea
what happened behind them.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:35.669
This is impossible!

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:37.671
That's what I'm talking about! Ka-chow!

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:39.548
What happened?

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:42.426
- Where are all the other cars?
- What is going on?

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:44.428
Oh, no!

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:53.938
Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London
still going to take place?

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:55.981
I suppose that...

01:09:56.108 --> 01:09:59.360
The show must go on,
as they say.

01:09:59.444 --> 01:10:01.529
I can't believe this is really happening!

01:10:01.613 --> 01:10:02.696
Quiet!

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:05.825
Will you require all the racers
to still run on allinol?

01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:10.788
I cannot, in good conscience, continue
to risk the lives of any more race cars.

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:14.708
The final race will not be run on allinol.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.962
There you have it, a clearly devastated
Sir Miles Axlerod

01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:22.216
announcing that he will not require
the cars to use allinol for the final race.

01:10:22.342 --> 01:10:23.676
A toast!

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.430
To the death of allinol
and alternative fuel forever!

01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:30.391
Mater, abort the mission.

01:10:30.475 --> 01:10:33.894
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.

01:10:34.646 --> 01:10:36.355
How is your grandfather?

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.399
Long live lemons!

01:10:38.483 --> 01:10:40.818
Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?

01:10:40.944 --> 01:10:42.736
Oh, yeah, it's unbelievable.

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:44.905
You are not leaving, are you?

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:46.907
Uh...of course I ain't leaving.

01:10:46.992 --> 01:10:48.742
- I'm just in shock...
- McQueen?

01:10:49.619 --> 01:10:51.579
Crashes are a part of racing, I know,

01:10:51.663 --> 01:10:54.331
but something like that
should never happen.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:58.461
You can choose your fuel
for the final race. What it'll be?

01:10:58.545 --> 01:11:00.045
- Allinol.

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.422
After today?

01:11:01.506 --> 01:11:04.467
My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me.

01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.927
I didn't stand by a friend of mine
recently.

01:11:07.012 --> 01:11:09.221
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

01:11:09.556 --> 01:11:12.266
So a surprising revelation
from Lightning McQueen.

01:11:12.392 --> 01:11:16.020
He will use allinol in the final race,
despite what occurred today.

01:11:16.146 --> 01:11:18.856
- ..Till Lightning McQueen is dead.
- Of course.

01:11:19.858 --> 01:11:23.027
Allinol must be finished for good.

01:11:23.695 --> 01:11:26.071
McQueen cannot win the last race.

01:11:26.823 --> 01:11:29.074
Lightning McQueen must be killed!

01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:30.451
No!

01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:39.460
It's the American spy!

01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:42.004
Dad-gum!

01:11:42.088 --> 01:11:44.173
- Gatlinggun.
- Request acknowledged.

01:11:44.257 --> 01:11:46.175
Down! Everybody, down!

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:49.220
- Shoot! I didn't mean...
- Request acknowledged.

01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:03.609
Wait! Wait!
I didn't mean that kind of shoot!

01:12:03.693 --> 01:12:05.819
Correction
acknowledged. Deploying chute.

01:12:05.904 --> 01:12:07.446
Whoa!

01:12:12.452 --> 01:12:13.494
McQueen!

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.166
Whoa! What's this?

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:20.584
Whoa!

01:12:24.798 --> 01:12:26.549
McQueen! McQueen!

01:12:29.594 --> 01:12:30.594
Waagh!

01:12:33.139 --> 01:12:34.974
Let me through! Let me through!

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.518
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!

01:12:37.602 --> 01:12:39.562
You cannot-a come through here!
Back up.

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.105
We have a lunatic at gate 9.

01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:44.984
I was disguised as a tow truck
to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:48.112
and my weapons system's done
misinterperated what I'm saying!

01:12:48.196 --> 01:12:50.864
- Lunatic at gate 9.
- McQueen! McQueen!

01:12:50.949 --> 01:12:53.158
- You are the champion!
Thisway, signore.

01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:55.202
- McQueen!
- Mater?

01:12:55.287 --> 01:12:57.705
- McQueen.
- Give us a pose!

01:12:57.789 --> 01:13:00.124
- McQueen!
- Stop moving. Stop!

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.959
Where you going?

01:13:02.043 --> 01:13:03.252
Stop!

01:13:03.837 --> 01:13:06.255
- McQueen!
- That really sounded like...

01:13:06.339 --> 01:13:07.548
Mater!

01:13:07.632 --> 01:13:09.174
- Mater?
- Signore?

01:13:09.259 --> 01:13:11.343
- McQueen!
- They're gonna kill you!

01:13:11.428 --> 01:13:12.803
Mater!

01:13:12.929 --> 01:13:14.221
Excuse me.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:16.098
No, where are you going?

01:13:16.182 --> 01:13:17.933
Scusi. Mater!

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:19.602
- McQueen!
- Scusi.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:22.146
Mater! Mater!

01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:24.189
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.

01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:27.359
Lightning McQueen!
I am a huge fan.

01:13:27.444 --> 01:13:29.069
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...

01:13:29.154 --> 01:13:33.157
That was me. I said, "You killed
out there today. You're the best."

01:13:33.241 --> 01:13:35.993
- What? I mean, thanks.
- Right this way, signore.

01:13:36.077 --> 01:13:38.078
I really thought I heard my friend.

01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:43.250
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:46.587
- Wait, what?
- The press is waiting.

01:13:46.671 --> 01:13:48.172
Come-a with me, please.

01:13:52.385 --> 01:13:53.761
Let me go!

01:13:53.845 --> 01:13:55.971
You actually care about that race car.

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.432
A pity you didn't warn him in time.

01:14:06.232 --> 01:14:08.108
- "Idiot"?
- Is that how you see me?

01:14:08.234 --> 01:14:11.320
- That's how everyone sees you.
- I tell you, that's the genius of it.

01:14:11.404 --> 01:14:13.447
No one realizes they're being fooled

01:14:13.531 --> 01:14:16.283
because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.

01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:18.369
At the fool...

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:20.663
Excuse me!

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:22.706
Domo arigato!

01:14:22.832 --> 01:14:24.083
Yeah!

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:28.295
You done good. You got all the leaves.

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.881
- Check out that tow truck.
- I wonder who that guy's with.

01:14:31.007 --> 01:14:33.884
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:36.678
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

01:14:40.058 --> 01:14:41.475
Aargh!

01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:46.522
Somebody get me water!
Oh, sweet relief.

01:14:46.606 --> 01:14:47.940
Mater!

01:14:52.862 --> 01:14:54.822
But I never leak oil. Never.

01:14:54.906 --> 01:14:56.907
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

01:14:57.492 --> 01:14:59.701
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw you up, did I?

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.830
- I lost the race because of you!
- Maybe if I talked to somebody...

01:15:02.914 --> 01:15:04.832
I don't need your help!

01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:06.875
I don't want your help.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.961
Your help...

01:15:09.587 --> 01:15:11.547
Bang the gong. Get it on!

01:15:11.631 --> 01:15:13.715
Listen,
this isn't Radiator Springs.

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:17.136
This is exactly why I don't bring
you along to these things!

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:30.732
Holley! Finn! Where are we?

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:34.111
We're in London, Mater,
inside Big Bentley.

01:15:39.742 --> 01:15:42.911
Whoa!

01:15:50.128 --> 01:15:52.087
Oh, this... This is all my fault.

01:15:52.172 --> 01:15:54.131
Don't be a fool, Mater.

01:15:54.215 --> 01:15:56.175
But I am, remember? You said so.

01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:58.218
When did I... Oh.

01:15:58.303 --> 01:16:02.306
Mater, I was complimenting you
on what a good spy you are.

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:04.224
I'm not a spy!

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:09.771
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:11.982
I really am just a tow truck.

01:16:12.108 --> 01:16:13.942
Finn, he's not joking.

01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:17.905
- I know.
- You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.

01:16:17.989 --> 01:16:21.366
And what's happened to McQueen
is 'cause I'm such a big one.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.161
This is all my fault.

01:16:27.248 --> 01:16:30.000
- Good. You're up.
- And just in time.

01:16:30.126 --> 01:16:32.794
Professor Z wanted you
to have a front-row seat,

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.838
for the death of Lightning McQueen.

01:16:34.964 --> 01:16:38.008
- He's still alive?
- Not for much longer.

01:16:42.514 --> 01:16:43.514
Whoa!

01:16:43.973 --> 01:16:45.057
Huh?

01:16:51.147 --> 01:16:53.857
- We came as soon as you called.
- I called to talk to Mater.

01:16:53.983 --> 01:16:56.193
It never occurred to me
he wouldn't be there.

01:16:56.277 --> 01:16:58.362
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.

01:16:58.488 --> 01:17:01.490
And Sarge is in touch with his friends
in the British military.

01:17:01.574 --> 01:17:03.242
You just need
to focus on the race.

01:17:03.368 --> 01:17:05.953
I know but, Sally with everything
going on, I'm not sure...

01:17:07.163 --> 01:17:09.456
- Sir Axlerod.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:17:09.582 --> 01:17:12.751
- It's all right.
- I just wanted to personally thank you.

01:17:12.835 --> 01:17:17.798
Because after Italy, I was finished,
and then you gave me one last shot.

01:17:17.882 --> 01:17:18.882
Listen...

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:22.302
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but I hope you win today.

01:17:22.428 --> 01:17:25.722
You show the world
that they've been wrong about allinol.

01:17:26.432 --> 01:17:28.433
Mater would want you to race.

01:17:29.602 --> 01:17:31.561
All right. For Mater.

01:18:05.888 --> 01:18:07.347
Here he comes.

01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:27.659
- What happened?
- I don't know, Professor.

01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:29.911
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing.

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:33.165
Ssh, I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?

01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:34.791
- You broke it!
- Quiet!

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:37.252
- I understand, sir. Yes.
- What did he say?

01:18:37.337 --> 01:18:40.255
- We go to the back-up plan.
- Back-up plan?

01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.341
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.

01:18:42.675 --> 01:18:46.053
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow"...

01:18:46.137 --> 01:18:48.138
he's going to go "ka-boom"!

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:52.559
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.

01:18:52.643 --> 01:18:54.811
Oh, wait, you could have!

01:18:54.937 --> 01:18:57.356
- Dad-gum lemons!
- Request acknowledged.

01:18:58.066 --> 01:19:00.609
What?
You didn't think we'd take your bullets?

01:19:03.821 --> 01:19:05.947
That's right! You got nothing!

01:19:06.991 --> 01:19:08.950
Who's the lemon now, huh?

01:19:11.871 --> 01:19:13.497
Nice try, Mater.

01:19:14.290 --> 01:19:17.709
- Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.
- Request... Request... Request...

01:19:18.503 --> 01:19:19.961
Mater!

01:19:25.176 --> 01:19:26.927
I got to get y'all out of there.

01:19:27.011 --> 01:19:29.388
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.

01:19:29.514 --> 01:19:31.807
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.

01:19:31.891 --> 01:19:34.309
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.

01:19:34.394 --> 01:19:36.895
- You can do that.
- What about you guys?

01:19:37.021 --> 01:19:40.440
- We'll be OK.
- Go and get some more dents, Mater.

01:19:49.158 --> 01:19:51.118
So, we'll be OK? Really?

01:19:51.202 --> 01:19:53.787
He wouldn't have left
if I'd told him the truth.

01:19:53.871 --> 01:19:55.205
Argh!

01:19:55.331 --> 01:19:56.915
Being killed by a clock.

01:19:56.999 --> 01:19:59.751
Gives a whole new meaning to
"Your time has come."

01:19:59.836 --> 01:20:01.837
Time? That's it!

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:12.681
- What are you doing?
- Trying to turn back time.

01:20:16.185 --> 01:20:19.229
If I can just reverse the polarity.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.860
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.

01:20:31.909 --> 01:20:34.786
What's everybody
on the wrong side of the road for?

01:20:36.789 --> 01:20:38.540
Oh, no!

01:20:38.624 --> 01:20:40.625
Drive! Burn rubber!

01:20:47.383 --> 01:20:49.384
We've got to get to the course.

01:20:50.094 --> 01:20:52.220
Calculate the fastest way to...

01:20:53.723 --> 01:20:54.764
Done.

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:56.558
Oh. Miss Shiftwell.

01:20:56.642 --> 01:21:00.437
- They're standard issue now.
- You kids get all the good hardware.

01:21:02.315 --> 01:21:03.899
Oh, no, that's Mater's.

01:21:04.275 --> 01:21:05.817
I knew his escape was too easy.

01:21:16.996 --> 01:21:18.455
Come back here! Stop!

01:21:21.792 --> 01:21:23.585
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!

01:21:24.670 --> 01:21:27.505
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?

01:21:27.632 --> 01:21:30.217
- We're here because of you, Mater.
- Is everything OK?

01:21:30.301 --> 01:21:32.928
No, everything's not OK.
There's a bomb in here.

01:21:33.012 --> 01:21:34.971
- Y'all got to get out. Now.
- A bomb?

01:21:36.599 --> 01:21:38.141
- Mater.
- Finn! You're OK.

01:21:38.267 --> 01:21:41.978
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:46.149
When we were knocked out,
they planted it in your air filter.

01:21:48.527 --> 01:21:51.154
- Uh-oh.
- Mater! There you are!

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.074
- Stop right there!
- I've been so worried about you.

01:21:54.158 --> 01:21:55.867
- Don't come any closer!
- Are you OK?

01:21:55.952 --> 01:21:57.953
No, I'm not OK! Stay away from me!

01:21:58.704 --> 01:22:00.163
No, wait! Wait!

01:22:00.289 --> 01:22:04.125
A tow truck has just raced
onto the track, driving backwards!

01:22:04.794 --> 01:22:06.670
Mater, wait!

01:22:07.004 --> 01:22:10.090
Normally an emergency vehicle on the
track means there's been an accident.

01:22:10.174 --> 01:22:12.884
- Lightning McQueen is chasing him!
- Mater, wait!

01:22:12.969 --> 01:22:16.763
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you're going to get hurt real bad!

01:22:16.889 --> 01:22:20.767
I know I made you feel that
way before, but none of that matters!

01:22:20.851 --> 01:22:22.352
We're best friends!

01:22:24.355 --> 01:22:26.022
And McQueen
seems to be having

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:27.899
a conversation with the tow truck.

01:22:28.025 --> 01:22:30.735
I don't know who
that truck is, Brent, but tell you what,

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:33.196
he's got to be the world's best
backwards driver.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:37.117
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!

01:22:37.201 --> 01:22:40.745
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!

01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:44.291
You've always been the bomb
and you'll always be the bomb.

01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:46.876
- Stay away!
- No! Never!

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.714
Almost there.

01:22:50.798 --> 01:22:54.592
I'm not letting you get away again!

01:22:55.386 --> 01:22:58.596
- Got to keep away from McQueen!
- Request acknowledged.

01:22:58.681 --> 01:23:00.557
Oh, my gosh.

01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:15.572
What is happening? It's a bad dream!

01:23:17.074 --> 01:23:19.576
And Lightning McQueen
just blasted away,

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:22.037
hooked to the now rocket-propelled
tow truck.

01:23:24.248 --> 01:23:25.623
Gargh!

01:23:30.463 --> 01:23:31.463
Aagh!

01:23:35.801 --> 01:23:37.344
The Professor's on the run!

01:23:37.428 --> 01:23:40.013
- Someone's got to get McQueen.
- Get McQueen!

01:23:41.432 --> 01:23:44.142
- Holley, I'll get Zundapp. Help Mater.
- Got it!

01:23:47.938 --> 01:23:49.939
What is happening?

01:24:03.996 --> 01:24:05.455
Hurry, Professor.

01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:20.053
You really think I'm going to let you
float away, Professor?

01:24:47.581 --> 01:24:49.541
- McQueen, let go!
- Never!

01:24:52.002 --> 01:24:54.129
- They're coming your way.
- Let's go!

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:03.680
Give it up, McMissile.

01:25:19.989 --> 01:25:23.491
- Mater, stop!
- No way! You could get hurt.

01:25:29.373 --> 01:25:30.748
Oh, no.

01:25:52.021 --> 01:25:53.646
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.

01:25:53.731 --> 01:25:54.731
Bomb?

01:25:55.024 --> 01:25:57.942
Yeah, they strapped it to me
to kill you as a back-up plan.

01:25:58.027 --> 01:26:00.528
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?

01:26:01.864 --> 01:26:04.324
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?

01:26:04.408 --> 01:26:05.742
Death ray?

01:26:05.826 --> 01:26:07.160
Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!

01:26:07.244 --> 01:26:09.746
Are you all so dense?
It's voice-activated.

01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:11.956
Everything is voice-activated
these days.

01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:13.917
Deactivate! Deactivate!

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.127
Voice denied.

01:26:17.838 --> 01:26:19.380
- Huh!
- Oops.

01:26:19.506 --> 01:26:21.966
Did I forget to mention
that it can only be disarmed

01:26:22.051 --> 01:26:23.760
by the one who activated it?

01:26:24.094 --> 01:26:26.012
- Say it.
- Deactivate.

01:26:26.972 --> 01:26:28.431
Voice denied.

01:26:31.393 --> 01:26:34.938
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?

01:26:35.856 --> 01:26:38.191
- You read my mind.
- He was getting on my nerves.

01:26:38.275 --> 01:26:41.819
- What do we do?
- It's very simple. You blow up.

01:26:42.238 --> 01:26:45.990
I'm going out on a limb here. These are
the guys that want me dead, correct?

01:26:46.075 --> 01:26:48.493
- It's nothing personal.
- Fellers, listen.

01:26:48.619 --> 01:26:52.622
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.

01:26:53.832 --> 01:26:57.001
But becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams

01:26:57.086 --> 01:26:59.545
ain't gonna make you feel better.

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:02.382
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.

01:27:11.725 --> 01:27:12.892
Pit stop.

01:27:17.147 --> 01:27:19.148
Not today, boys.

01:27:28.742 --> 01:27:29.742
Retreat!

01:27:32.663 --> 01:27:34.414
Thanks for the help, Corporal.

01:27:34.498 --> 01:27:36.833
Anything for one of Pop's mates.

01:27:42.965 --> 01:27:44.924
What's he saying? What's wrong?

01:27:45.009 --> 01:27:47.010
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.

01:27:49.346 --> 01:27:51.264
I get it. I get it!

01:27:51.348 --> 01:27:53.683
- I know what needs to be done.
- Then do it!

01:27:53.767 --> 01:27:55.935
What? No. I can't do it.

01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.979
Nobody takes me seriously.

01:27:58.063 --> 01:28:01.190
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.

01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:02.984
Yes, it is.

01:28:03.235 --> 01:28:05.862
Look, you're yourself
in Radiator Springs.

01:28:05.946 --> 01:28:07.905
Be yourself here.

01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:09.949
And if people aren't taking you
seriously,

01:28:10.034 --> 01:28:12.660
then they need to change, not you.

01:28:12.745 --> 01:28:14.871
I know that
because I was wrong before.

01:28:15.539 --> 01:28:17.540
Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.

01:28:17.708 --> 01:28:19.292
Thanks, buddy.

01:28:19.376 --> 01:28:21.878
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!

01:28:21.962 --> 01:28:23.963
Oh, right. Hang on!

01:28:25.674 --> 01:28:27.675
Where's he going?

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.262
- Computer!
- Yes, Agent Mater?

01:28:31.347 --> 01:28:34.223
I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!

01:28:34.308 --> 01:28:35.558
Request acknowledged.

01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:41.272
- Mater?
- Now I need you to do the chute!

01:28:41.357 --> 01:28:43.316
The second kind, not the first!

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.234
Deploying chute.

01:29:08.967 --> 01:29:10.593
Who's winning the race?

01:29:14.932 --> 01:29:17.350
- Back off! Back away!
- It's Lightning McQueen!

01:29:17.434 --> 01:29:19.602
No, it's OK! Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.

01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:21.270
Okay.

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:22.855
Somebody's been sabotaging

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:25.233
the racers and hurtin' the cars,
and I know who.

01:29:25.317 --> 01:29:27.068
Oh, wait. Your Majesty.

01:29:27.152 --> 01:29:29.195
Bomb! It's a bomb!

01:29:29.905 --> 01:29:32.407
- Everybody, down!
- Back up! Move it!

01:29:34.618 --> 01:29:36.536
Get off the stage! Move it!

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.580
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!

01:29:39.706 --> 01:29:43.042
Mater, I don't know what you're doing,
but stand down now.

01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:45.878
This ain't nothing at all
like Radiator Springs.

01:29:45.963 --> 01:29:47.922
Mater, just cut to the chase.

01:29:48.006 --> 01:29:49.966
Okay. It's him.

01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:53.094
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

01:29:53.178 --> 01:29:55.179
I figured it out when I realized

01:29:55.264 --> 01:29:58.683
y'all attached this ticking time bomb
with Whitworth bolts...

01:29:58.809 --> 01:30:02.770
the same bolts that hold together that
old British engine from the photograph.

01:30:03.814 --> 01:30:04.814
- Holley! Show that picture.
- OK.

01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:07.900
I remembered what they say
about old British engines:

01:30:07.985 --> 01:30:10.653
If there ain't no oil under 'em,
there ain't no oil in 'em.

01:30:10.779 --> 01:30:12.655
What is he talking about?

01:30:12.823 --> 01:30:15.366
It was you leaking oil
at the party in Japan.

01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:17.118
You just blamed it on me.

01:30:17.202 --> 01:30:19.745
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.

01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:23.124
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.

01:30:24.251 --> 01:30:27.128
If we pop that hood,
we'll see that engine from that picture.

01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:30.214
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

01:30:31.675 --> 01:30:32.842
Stay away!

01:30:32.926 --> 01:30:36.804
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?

01:30:36.889 --> 01:30:40.433
To make allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil.

01:30:40.517 --> 01:30:43.060
He said it himself
with that disguised voice.

01:30:43.145 --> 01:30:47.190
Disguised voice? What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you are!

01:30:47.274 --> 01:30:50.151
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.737
One moment, I'd like to see
where this is going.

01:30:53.864 --> 01:30:55.698
Mater, he created allinol.

01:30:55.824 --> 01:30:57.533
But what if he found that huge oil field

01:30:57.618 --> 01:31:00.077
just as the world was trying to find
something else?

01:31:00.204 --> 01:31:04.040
What if he came up with allinol
just to make alternative fuel look bad?

01:31:04.124 --> 01:31:06.959
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?

01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:09.170
- Okay, that's it.
- Lads, clear out.

01:31:09.254 --> 01:31:12.381
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:14.300
- Keep away, you idiot!
- Mater!

01:31:15.135 --> 01:31:17.678
- Mater!
- Someone do something!

01:31:20.516 --> 01:31:22.350
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

01:31:24.436 --> 01:31:28.523
- Bomb deactivated.
- Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.

01:31:36.281 --> 01:31:39.158
- The engine from the photo.
- It's a perfect match.

01:31:39.243 --> 01:31:41.410
How did the tow truck figure it out?

01:31:41.787 --> 01:31:45.164
It's official. You're coming to
all my races from now on.

01:31:45.249 --> 01:31:47.250
Now you're talkin'!

01:31:50.587 --> 01:31:52.505
Hyeeugh!

01:31:55.634 --> 01:31:57.927
Mater, let's go. You're on.

01:32:02.432 --> 01:32:04.684
Your Majesty, may I present

01:32:04.768 --> 01:32:08.771
for the investiture of honorary
knighthood of the British Realm...

01:32:08.939 --> 01:32:12.358
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.

01:32:12.442 --> 01:32:14.443
Go get 'em, buddy.

01:32:21.994 --> 01:32:26.789
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.

01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:31.669
Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater,
Your Majesty.

01:32:31.753 --> 01:32:34.005
I don't wanna hear none of this "sir"
business.

01:32:34.131 --> 01:32:36.132
By the way, have y'all met each other?

01:32:36.216 --> 01:32:37.967
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.

01:32:38.093 --> 01:32:40.928
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile,
McQueen. Queen, McMissile.

01:32:45.976 --> 01:32:49.020
So there we was,
my rocket jets going full blast,

01:32:49.104 --> 01:32:51.022
McQueen hanging on for dear life

01:32:51.148 --> 01:32:55.109
when suddenly them two nasty lemons
come out of nowheres, guns drawed.

01:32:55.193 --> 01:32:56.902
We was goners.

01:32:56.987 --> 01:33:00.197
But then, out of nowhere
this beautiful spy car

01:33:00.282 --> 01:33:02.283
swoops in from the sky to save us!

01:33:02.534 --> 01:33:05.328
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.

01:33:05.412 --> 01:33:07.371
Oh, Minny, please. Come on!

01:33:07.497 --> 01:33:11.334
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.

01:33:11.418 --> 01:33:14.920
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit far-fetched.

01:33:15.005 --> 01:33:16.839
Holley! What are you doin' here?

01:33:16.923 --> 01:33:19.842
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.

01:33:19.926 --> 01:33:20.926
Finn!

01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:23.137
Our satellites picked up
an urgent communique.

01:33:23.263 --> 01:33:24.972
So you got-a my email.

01:33:25.057 --> 01:33:27.475
Y'all is going to have a great time!

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:31.437
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.

01:33:31.521 --> 01:33:32.688
Don't tell nobody.

01:33:32.814 --> 01:33:34.774
And this is Holley Shiftwell.

01:33:34.858 --> 01:33:36.859
- She's...
- I'm Mater's girlfriend.

01:33:36.943 --> 01:33:38.903
It's so nice to meet you all.

01:33:39.029 --> 01:33:41.197
Guido believe you now.

01:33:41.323 --> 01:33:43.908
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.

01:33:44.034 --> 01:33:45.826
- Yeah.
- Was that from when you swooped in

01:33:45.911 --> 01:33:47.745
and you saved them in London?

01:33:47.871 --> 01:33:49.789
- Van!
- What? I'm just asking!

01:33:49.915 --> 01:33:54.585
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone
can get that fixed up for you in no time.

01:33:54.711 --> 01:33:57.755
Yeah, sure thing.
No problemo. Let me go get my tools.

01:33:57.881 --> 01:34:00.674
Oh, no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.

01:34:01.885 --> 01:34:06.097
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.

01:34:06.181 --> 01:34:07.973
Those two are perfect for each other.

01:34:08.058 --> 01:34:10.559
There's one thing I still don't get.

01:34:10.685 --> 01:34:13.479
The bad guys hit me with the beam
from the camera, right?

01:34:13.563 --> 01:34:17.233
- So, why didn't I...
- Explode in a fiery inferno?

01:34:17.359 --> 01:34:19.485
- Yeah.
- We couldn't figure that out, either.

01:34:19.569 --> 01:34:22.571
Our investigation proved
that allinol was actually gasoline

01:34:22.697 --> 01:34:25.991
and Axlerod engineered it so when it
got hit by the beam, it would explode.

01:34:26.076 --> 01:34:30.162
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!

01:34:32.666 --> 01:34:37.753
If you're implying that I switched
that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel

01:34:37.879 --> 01:34:41.715
with my all-natural, sustainable,
organic biofuel

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:47.179
just because I never trusted Axlerod,
you're dead wrong, man!

01:34:47.264 --> 01:34:49.348
It was him!

01:34:49.433 --> 01:34:53.477
Once big oil, always big oil, man.

01:34:53.562 --> 01:34:54.979
Tree-hugger.

01:34:55.897 --> 01:34:59.442
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix
is about to begin.

01:34:59.526 --> 01:35:01.819
All spectators, clear the starting line.

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:07.199
I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked!

01:35:07.284 --> 01:35:08.909
We should do this every year.

01:35:08.994 --> 01:35:12.121
Yeah, I just figured we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.

01:35:12.205 --> 01:35:14.748
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.

01:35:14.833 --> 01:35:18.461
- The way I like it.
- Francesco likes it like this, too.

01:35:18.545 --> 01:35:22.131
- Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
- SignorinaSally.

01:35:22.215 --> 01:35:23.549
It is official.

01:35:23.633 --> 01:35:26.218
Lightning McQueen
is the luckiest car in the world.

01:35:26.303 --> 01:35:28.429
Why, thank you.

01:35:28.513 --> 01:35:31.599
Which he will have to be to have
a chance against Francesco today!

01:35:31.683 --> 01:35:34.768
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?

01:35:34.978 --> 01:35:37.313
Just something I had made up
for the occasion.

01:35:37.689 --> 01:35:39.690
Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny.

01:35:39.774 --> 01:35:42.568
Was-a funnier when I did it,
but it's-a very funny.

01:35:42.694 --> 01:35:45.905
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?

01:35:45.989 --> 01:35:47.740
Try it. You'll like it.

01:35:47.824 --> 01:35:49.992
So, he's not so good-looking.

01:35:50.118 --> 01:35:52.453
- Yeah. Nice try.
- I'm serious!

01:35:52.537 --> 01:35:54.747
That's why I love you, Sally.

01:35:54.831 --> 01:35:57.666
- Wish me luck!
- You don't need it!

01:35:57.751 --> 01:36:01.587
Ooh-hm!
That Francesco is fine-looking!

01:36:01.671 --> 01:36:03.214
And those open wheels.

01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:06.342
Ooh, I'm gonna have to go get myself
some coolant.

01:36:17.729 --> 01:36:18.938
Go, Lightning!

01:36:37.457 --> 01:36:39.124
- Go, Stickers!
- Right on, man!

01:36:39.209 --> 01:36:41.168
- Go get 'em, tiger!
- Bravo, bravo!

01:36:41.253 --> 01:36:44.630
- Go, Lightning, go!
- Go, McQueen! Whoo-hoo!

01:36:44.714 --> 01:36:47.132
Finn? Time to go.

01:36:47.217 --> 01:36:49.510
Siddeley's gassed, geared
and ready to fly.

01:36:50.345 --> 01:36:53.514
- You're leavin' already?
- We've got another mission.

01:36:53.598 --> 01:36:55.933
Just stopped by here
to pick something up.

01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:00.729
Somethin' tells me you're not
talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers.

01:37:00.855 --> 01:37:03.190
Her Majesty asked for you personally,
Mater.

01:37:03.275 --> 01:37:06.652
- But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
- We know.

01:37:06.736 --> 01:37:10.406
Spy or not, you're still the smartest,
most honest chap we've ever met.

01:37:10.532 --> 01:37:13.867
- Don't forget massively charming.
- Well, thanks.

01:37:13.952 --> 01:37:17.079
But as much fun as it was
hangin' with y'all, this...

01:37:17.163 --> 01:37:19.832
This is home.

01:37:19.916 --> 01:37:22.835
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.

01:37:22.919 --> 01:37:24.753
You still owe me that first date.

01:37:24.879 --> 01:37:27.840
If there's ever anything I can do for you,
just let me know.

01:37:27.924 --> 01:37:30.175
Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you.

01:37:31.511 --> 01:37:34.263
Actually, there is one thing.

01:37:34.764 --> 01:37:37.099
Whoo-hoo!

01:37:37.183 --> 01:37:39.143
Whoo! I'll be doggone!

01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:45.357
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:37:48.403 --> 01:37:49.945
Thanks, Mater!

01:37:57.412 --> 01:37:59.413
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!

01:38:01.124 --> 01:38:03.000
Impossible!

01:38:03.543 --> 01:38:05.002
- Ha-ha!
- Mater!

01:38:05.128 --> 01:38:07.713
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.

01:38:07.797 --> 01:38:09.882
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!

01:38:09.966 --> 01:38:11.925
Not if I see you first!

01:38:12.010 --> 01:45:50.801
Yippee!
