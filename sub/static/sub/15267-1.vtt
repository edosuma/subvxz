03:20.767 --> 03:22.997
How do you feel?

03:25.305 --> 03:28.365
I'm Dr. Berkus,
Marin County Hospital...

03:28.441 --> 03:33.378
and you are one
very lucky woman, Mrs. Merrick.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.471
I wish I could say the same
for your husband.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.849
No.

03:39.919 --> 03:43.650
We're doing everything we can,
but you have to understand...

03:43.723 --> 03:46.715
he went all the way down
in that car.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.590
He's in a deep coma.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.183
Honey...

04:19.259 --> 04:21.853
it's me, darling.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.896
It's Judith.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.921
Who?

04:30.970 --> 04:32.938
It's me...

04:33.006 --> 04:34.303
Judith.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.916
We call that
psychogenic amnesia.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.584
The patient doesn't know
his name, his family...

04:53.660 --> 04:55.992
his personal history.
Everything else, he remembers...

04:56.062 --> 05:00.123
the year, who's president.
He can drive a car.

05:00.199 --> 05:02.190
He can function professionally.

05:02.268 --> 05:05.066
But anything personal
is out of reach.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.537
For how long?

05:06.606 --> 05:10.133
Could be... a week.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.677
I'm going to have to be honest.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.736
It could also be permanent.

05:46.546 --> 05:49.777
Mexico. Cabo San Lucas...

05:49.849 --> 05:52.579
Our vacation with Jeb
and Jenny last year.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.908
Oh, darling, don't.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.240
I'm so afraid.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.849
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.885
You're alive.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.786
And you're not alone.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.060
I'll always be with you.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.430
Always.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.908
Do you know who they are?

06:49.976 --> 06:53.207
Sure. You told me.
That's Jeb and Jenny Scott.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.381
She's kind of attractive.

06:57.450 --> 07:01.682
Oh, yeah. She also writes
horoscopes and reads palms.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.382
I take it she's not an active
part of the business.

07:04.457 --> 07:07.051
Her contribution
to Merrick-Scott development...

07:07.126 --> 07:10.755
is to spend Jeb's money so fast
it keeps him hustling.

07:10.830 --> 07:11.819
Hustling?

07:11.898 --> 07:14.332
He's a real killer.
Remember, I told you...

07:14.400 --> 07:16.664
It hurts. It hurts!

07:16.736 --> 07:19.762
You know the therapist said
you have to do this.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.587
They had this on the jukebox...

07:35.655 --> 07:37.714
in that funky little bar
in Mexico.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.917
You put it on so many times...

07:39.992 --> 07:43.155
some drunk offered us
10,000 pesos to give it a rest.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.161
Did we accept?

07:44.230 --> 07:46.198
10,000 pesos is only $5.00.

07:46.265 --> 07:48.563
We were insulted.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.935
Dan, should I tell you...

07:54.006 --> 07:55.633
what I want more than anything?

07:55.708 --> 07:56.766
When we're through here...

07:56.843 --> 07:58.003
I want to go back to Mexico.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.511
Jeb can ride out
the marina development.

08:00.580 --> 08:04.175
That's his baby anyway.
And besides, he owes you, Dan.

08:05.718 --> 08:08.312
We need time together.

08:08.387 --> 08:09.684
Alone.

08:09.755 --> 08:12.189
Sounds OK to me.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.351
After I get back
to San Francisco...

08:14.427 --> 08:17.191
find out where I live,
where I work.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.555
Mexico.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.186
Shall I tell you
what we used to do there...

08:51.264 --> 08:53.232
on that beach at night?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.669
Shall I tell you?

08:59.438 --> 09:00.700
Shall I?

09:00.773 --> 09:02.172
Yes.

10:15.047 --> 10:16.241
Remember?

10:16.315 --> 10:18.078
Yes. Yes, I do.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.243
That's the Transamerica
building, right?

10:20.319 --> 10:22.378
Right, and on the 36th floor...

10:22.455 --> 10:24.320
Merrick-Scott Development.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.589
Oh, wow.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.097
Hey, I know this place.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.861
You really remember?

11:08.934 --> 11:10.196
Well, I don't know...

11:10.269 --> 11:12.294
but I could swear
I've been here before.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.051
Don't say anything.

11:34.293 --> 11:35.453
Hello?

11:35.528 --> 11:36.825
Oh, hi, Jeb.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.865
No. We just got back.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.126
Oh, he's fine.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.633
He's a little tired.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.703
Well...

11:45.771 --> 11:47.170
thanks, Jeb, but you know...

11:47.239 --> 11:51.972
we just want to lie low
for the first few days.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.409
That would be great.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.379
No. I promise.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.382
OK.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.684
Well, maybe next weekend.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.187
OK.

12:03.255 --> 12:05.723
Love to Jenny. Bye.

12:22.775 --> 12:23.799
Dan!

12:24.844 --> 12:27.244
Stop! No! Dan!

12:30.015 --> 12:34.509
Darling, I'm here to help.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.849
Easy.

12:37.022 --> 12:39.490
We were warned
this might happen.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.985
Remember, we're a team.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.094
We'll face this together.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.421
There's something
about this room.

13:10.489 --> 13:12.684
These mirrors
just make me crazy.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.692
I'm so sorry.

13:14.760 --> 13:18.719
If something here upsets you,
let's just go away.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.528
We'll leave tonight
if you want to.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.727
I don't want to go.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.967
Whatever you want.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.572
Careful.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.285
Jesus.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.256
Where'd you get thrown out?

13:55.334 --> 13:57.234
I don't know.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.362
Up there somewhere.

13:59.438 --> 14:02.601
I was pretty smashed, huh?

14:02.675 --> 14:07.009
Well, Jeb's idea of playing host
is soak the guests.

14:07.079 --> 14:09.843
He did everything
but pour it over our heads.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.179
So...

14:12.251 --> 14:13.946
happy New Year.

14:16.989 --> 14:19.287
You know what I like
about amnesia?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.690
What?

14:21.760 --> 14:25.696
Well, after seven years
of marriage...

14:25.764 --> 14:29.200
I get to fall in love with you
all over again.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.702
Oh, Dan.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.237
I mean it.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.709
Hey, was I always
this sentimental?

14:38.777 --> 14:41.769
No, but don't stop.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.620
- Hi.
- Oh, Jenny.

14:51.690 --> 14:52.952
Is something wrong?

14:53.025 --> 14:55.220
No. I was just running
for the phone.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.728
- How's Dan? Is he OK?
- Yes.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.229
Really?
Everything's fine?

14:59.298 --> 15:03.166
Yes. Dan's getting back
to his old routines.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.169
That's great, great news.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.431
Yes.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.370
Back in shape?

15:08.440 --> 15:10.408
Yes, he is.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.271
Yeah.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.581
Yes, he does, Jenny.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.846
He looks great.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.356
He sounds sexier than ever.

17:22.273 --> 17:23.969
So here you are.

17:25.577 --> 17:26.839
Jenny tried to bully us...

17:26.912 --> 17:28.880
into going over there
for dinner tonight...

17:28.947 --> 17:31.438
but I said you weren't
quite ready for it.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.879
Dan?

17:36.755 --> 17:38.279
Is something the matter?

17:40.659 --> 17:42.752
We can go over there
if you want to.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.193
I just thought...

17:44.263 --> 17:45.321
No.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.838
I'd like to go.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.255
Hell of a thing, pal,
when you think about it, huh?

18:15.327 --> 18:18.194
Start a new life,
see everything with a fresh eye.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.754
Kind of like being a kid again.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.698
It definitely has its upside.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.963
Boy, when I think of some of
the things I'd like to forget.

18:25.037 --> 18:28.006
Like the time when I was 15...
I took Mary Louise McBirney...

18:28.073 --> 18:30.974
to Lou Ann's Diner on a date.
I came up two bucks short.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.102
She called her father
to come and bail us out.

18:33.178 --> 18:35.669
He called me
"a pathetic little pissant!"

18:35.747 --> 18:37.305
He spoke like that.

18:37.382 --> 18:39.748
Anyway, he scared
the shit out of me.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.410
I couldn't get it up
again for two years.

18:41.487 --> 18:44.479
I was a virgin
until I was seventeen.

18:44.556 --> 18:47.616
Dan, it's so good
to have you home.

18:47.693 --> 18:51.151
I can't even imagine how ghastly
this has been for you.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.164
We really wanted
to visit you...

18:53.232 --> 18:55.427
in the hospital,
but Judith just insisted...

18:55.501 --> 18:58.595
Oh, lord. It wasn't me, Jenny.
It was the doctors.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.138
The psychiatrist
vetoed all visits...

19:01.206 --> 19:02.969
till the surgery was over.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.440
I thought Dan needed...

19:04.510 --> 19:06.978
all the memory stimulation
he could get...

19:07.045 --> 19:09.411
but the doctors
left it all to me.

19:09.481 --> 19:13.850
It's been very strange
and very wonderful.

19:13.919 --> 19:16.820
Like being shipwrecked
on a desert island...

19:16.889 --> 19:19.790
having to rediscover
each other again.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.951
All right. Let's get serious.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.461
When do you think you might
want to, you know...

19:24.530 --> 19:27.761
start phasing your way
back into the office?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.164
Tomorrow.

19:29.234 --> 19:31.202
Look, I didn't mean
to rush you, pal.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.295
I gotta back and forth
to L.A. All week.

19:33.372 --> 19:34.498
Well, l...

19:34.573 --> 19:37.440
No. No. I don't...
you probably forgot...

19:37.509 --> 19:38.601
Forget it.

19:41.980 --> 19:45.211
No, but I feel the sooner
I start, the better.

19:45.284 --> 19:47.377
Find out what kind
of player I am...

19:47.452 --> 19:50.012
or if I'm just dead weight.

19:50.088 --> 19:52.022
I did your chart today, Dan.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.320
Every sign is positive for you.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.623
Do you really think
you're ready for this?

19:56.695 --> 19:58.185
Don't you think I am?

19:58.263 --> 20:00.231
Listen, why don't you
come back in tomorrow morning?

20:00.299 --> 20:03.928
We'll find out.
But right now, come on, pal...

20:04.002 --> 20:07.369
let's us boys go do a brandy
and business, huh?

20:07.439 --> 20:09.304
Honey, why don't you
show Judith...

20:09.374 --> 20:10.966
whatever it is
that you bought today?

20:13.779 --> 20:17.510
In this unreliable
old world, about the...

20:17.583 --> 20:20.211
about the only thing
I can count on for sure...

20:20.285 --> 20:22.344
is that Jenny has been out
hitting the stores.

20:23.622 --> 20:27.922
Well, Jenny,
you buy anything gorgeous?

20:27.993 --> 20:30.052
Who gives a shit?

20:30.128 --> 20:32.289
Wait until you see
what we're doing...

20:32.364 --> 20:33.854
with the marina development.

20:33.932 --> 20:37.561
We're gonna clear five big ones
on the first phase alone.

20:37.636 --> 20:41.265
I think I finessed Miller
down at City Hall...

20:41.340 --> 20:43.672
so all we have to do
to get past go...

20:43.742 --> 20:46.939
is be a little creative
on our teamster deal.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.981
- I need to ask you a question.
- Shoot.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.448
Before the accident,
was I having trouble...

20:52.517 --> 20:54.451
with Judith, with my marriage?

20:54.519 --> 20:56.384
We all have trouble
with our marriage.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.547
What we've gotta address...

20:57.623 --> 20:59.056
is how to avoid trouble
with the teamsters.

20:59.124 --> 21:01.684
Jeb, I need to talk,
really talk.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.887
You mentioned divorce
a couple of times...

21:03.962 --> 21:05.395
but you were drinking.
So what?

21:05.464 --> 21:07.125
Jenny threatens divorce
once a month.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.723
I mentioned divorce?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.597
Yeah, that night at the party.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.796
Aw, come on, pal.

21:12.871 --> 21:15.066
You were juiced.
We were all juiced.

21:15.140 --> 21:18.075
Listen, Dan,
you must know that, uh...

21:18.143 --> 21:20.202
you know,
I feel kind of guilty.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.144
I mean...

21:22.214 --> 21:24.307
how was it between Judith
and me that night?

21:24.383 --> 21:25.315
What does it matter now?

21:25.384 --> 21:26.476
Were we arguing?

21:26.551 --> 21:28.451
No, you were not arguing.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.956
You were fucking screaming
at each other!

21:37.329 --> 21:39.490
Judith was having
an affair, right?

21:39.564 --> 21:41.964
How the hell should I know?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.763
But I'll tell you this much.

21:43.835 --> 21:46.804
If she was,
who could blame her?

21:46.872 --> 21:48.601
What does that mean?

21:48.674 --> 21:52.576
It means you treated her like
a piece of goddamn furniture.

21:53.745 --> 21:57.340
Down in Cabo San Lucas...

21:57.416 --> 21:59.441
it was fuckin' embarrassing.

21:59.518 --> 22:00.678
In Mexico?

22:02.020 --> 22:04.614
Jeb, can't business wait?

22:04.690 --> 22:06.749
When do I get to talk to Dan?

22:07.893 --> 22:09.952
He's all yours, babe.

22:16.368 --> 22:17.835
I'm not a fool.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.796
I can tell how uneasy you are.

22:22.874 --> 22:24.603
Let me help you.

22:26.878 --> 22:29.813
I don't know.
I need somebody...

22:29.881 --> 22:32.714
to tell me the truth
about a few things...

22:32.784 --> 22:34.843
about my life.

22:37.389 --> 22:40.449
Well, Jeb says...

22:40.525 --> 22:42.220
What did Jeb tell you?

22:47.532 --> 22:49.523
What a shit I was to Judith.

22:49.601 --> 22:51.034
What you were to her?

22:54.039 --> 22:56.132
Did he tell you about Mexico?

22:57.843 --> 23:00.038
- About Stanton?
- Who?

23:00.112 --> 23:02.012
Jack Stanton.

23:04.850 --> 23:06.875
You met him in Cabo.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.454
Claimed to be
a fellow architect.

23:10.522 --> 23:15.585
We all smelled a rat...
except Judith.

23:15.660 --> 23:18.151
She never let him
out of her sight.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.893
She even had him follow her
back here to San Francisco.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.902
What the hell
are you getting at?

23:24.970 --> 23:26.597
You wanted the truth.

23:26.671 --> 23:30.004
I'm telling you the truth.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.202
I saw them...

23:32.277 --> 23:34.142
up at the Hacienda.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.009
The day before the accident.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.072
- Where?
- The Hacienda...

23:38.150 --> 23:40.812
the hotel up in Ross.

23:40.886 --> 23:43.320
I saw Stanton's red Porsche
out front...

23:43.388 --> 23:45.583
right next
to the white Mercedes.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.124
Wait a minute.

23:47.192 --> 23:51.629
You're saying this guy
Stanton...

23:51.696 --> 23:54.961
is the only person in
Marin County with a red Porsche?

23:55.033 --> 23:57.297
Judith's the only one
with a white Mercedes?

23:57.369 --> 23:59.303
Hey, do me a favor, OK?

23:59.371 --> 24:02.602
You came this close
to being killed.

24:02.674 --> 24:05.472
She didn't even
sprain her ankle.

24:05.544 --> 24:06.977
You think about that.

24:09.347 --> 24:10.814
She was thrown clear.

24:12.350 --> 24:14.443
Was she falling...

24:14.519 --> 24:15.713
or jumping?

24:20.158 --> 24:21.386
Well?

25:09.841 --> 25:11.809
May I help you?

25:16.948 --> 25:20.611
Why, it's Mr. Merrick,
isn't it?

25:20.685 --> 25:23.210
Rudy Costa, assistant manager.

25:23.288 --> 25:26.189
It's so wonderful
to have you back, Mr. Merrick.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.852
You look great!
You lost some weight...

25:28.927 --> 25:31.395
but none the worse
for the accident.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.828
Why, thank you.

25:32.898 --> 25:35.526
Is there anything
I can do for you?

25:35.600 --> 25:38.694
Maybe.
I'm looking for a woman...

25:38.770 --> 25:41.330
who I think used to come here.

25:41.406 --> 25:42.839
You know her?

25:42.908 --> 25:45.604
Sure. But Mr. Merrick...

25:45.677 --> 25:48.646
we are very discreet here,
as you know.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.146
Mr. uh...

25:50.215 --> 25:51.409
- Costa.
- Costa...

25:51.483 --> 25:56.477
this is a very sensitive
situation for me.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.819
I lost track of her when
I was in the hospital...

25:58.890 --> 26:00.653
and I...

26:00.725 --> 26:02.693
well, I'm sure you understand.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.093
Sure.

26:05.163 --> 26:07.893
But, uh, still...

26:14.005 --> 26:15.563
Well...

26:24.316 --> 26:28.776
for a while,
she used to come in every day.

26:28.853 --> 26:31.083
Always in the afternoon,
as I recall...

26:31.156 --> 26:33.784
and always
with the same gentleman.

26:33.858 --> 26:35.689
But then it stopped.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.955
What was the gentleman's name?

26:38.029 --> 26:41.795
His name?
Yes, what was his name?

26:41.866 --> 26:44.960
You know, I can't quite remem...

26:45.036 --> 26:46.970
Wait a minute. It, uh...

26:47.038 --> 26:48.801
it was Stanley something.

26:48.873 --> 26:49.931
No... no...

26:50.008 --> 26:51.976
it was Stanton.
Yes, that was it...

26:52.043 --> 26:53.305
Stanton.

26:53.378 --> 26:56.313
Good-looking guy,
kind of close-mouthed.

26:56.381 --> 26:59.908
Discreet,
if you know what I mean.

26:59.985 --> 27:04.251
He and the lady would always
arrive separately.

27:04.322 --> 27:07.257
Mr. Merrick,
can I offer you a drink?

27:07.325 --> 27:08.952
Thank you, Mr. Costa.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.053
Thank you, Mr. Merrick...

27:12.130 --> 27:15.429
and be sure to give
my kind regards to your wife.

27:20.839 --> 27:21.965
My wife?

27:34.919 --> 27:36.546
Here we are...

27:40.525 --> 27:42.891
our new marina complex.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.297
That's the Merrick-Scott Tower.

27:47.365 --> 27:50.801
We got most of it rented off
at 42 bucks a square foot...

27:50.869 --> 27:53.303
but the top five floors
are all ours.

27:53.371 --> 27:54.303
That's great.

27:54.372 --> 27:55.498
Yeah, you bet.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.672
Very impressive, Jeb.

27:58.743 --> 28:01.234
Well, it was your design, pal.

28:01.312 --> 28:02.574
Aw, I didn't...

28:02.647 --> 28:04.808
Don't you remember at first?
You had the E.P.A. guy...

28:04.883 --> 28:08.250
so far up your ass,
you had heartburn.

28:08.319 --> 28:10.753
Boy, the way
you handled that...

28:10.822 --> 28:11.754
sheer poetry.

28:11.823 --> 28:12.755
Really?

28:12.824 --> 28:14.257
Your ticket, Jeb.

28:14.325 --> 28:15.257
Thanks.

28:15.326 --> 28:16.588
What did I do?

28:16.661 --> 28:18.788
Homework. You found out
about the pretty young boy...

28:18.863 --> 28:20.353
he was spending
his nights with...

28:20.432 --> 28:22.366
when his wife thought
he was off working the files.

28:22.434 --> 28:25.426
You had a friendly
little chat with him...

28:25.503 --> 28:26.595
no more heartburn.

28:26.671 --> 28:28.263
I was a real prince, huh?

28:28.339 --> 28:31.001
Oh, prince of princes.
Now, Dan...

28:31.076 --> 28:35.308
I'd like you to meet
your secretary Nancy Mercer.

28:37.682 --> 28:39.115
Welcome back... Dan.

28:39.184 --> 28:40.446
Thank you.

28:40.518 --> 28:42.179
I really mean it.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.312
It's ten after.
I'm gonna miss my plane.

28:44.389 --> 28:47.290
Now, if there's anything
you need...

28:47.358 --> 28:48.757
Nancy'll handle it.

28:48.827 --> 28:50.055
Welcome back, pal.

28:51.096 --> 28:52.222
Thanks, Jeb.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.461
Klein's Animal House.

29:34.472 --> 29:36.406
Listen,
if this is a breather...

29:36.474 --> 29:39.272
can you wait
while I get a cigarette?

29:39.344 --> 29:41.608
Sorry, wrong number.

29:41.679 --> 29:43.442
Here we go.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.779
Black with Sweet 'N' Low.

29:45.850 --> 29:48.819
That's the way
you used to take it.

29:53.224 --> 29:54.816
Thank you, Nancy.

29:58.363 --> 30:00.957
Is something wrong?

30:02.534 --> 30:05.628
Oh, no.

30:05.703 --> 30:08.934
Tell me something...
last Christmas...

30:09.007 --> 30:11.271
did I buy anybody pets?

30:11.342 --> 30:13.310
Pets?

30:13.378 --> 30:15.312
Well, not that I recall.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.178
Mostly it was gift certificates
to Neiman's.

30:18.249 --> 30:20.183
Jesus.

30:20.251 --> 30:21.741
Personal touch, huh?

30:22.787 --> 30:24.049
Nancy, tell me something.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.317
Does this name... Klein...

30:26.391 --> 30:28.291
Does that mean anything to you?

30:28.359 --> 30:30.987
Oh, yeah. That guy.

30:31.062 --> 30:34.054
Mr. Klein called several times
back in January...

30:34.132 --> 30:36.032
regarding
an outstanding invoice.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.795
But since he wouldn't say
what it was for...

30:37.869 --> 30:38.801
I didn't pay him.

30:38.870 --> 30:40.770
I have it on file
if you'd like it.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.864
- Yeah, I would, thanks.
- OK.

30:48.413 --> 30:52.873
Nancy? Have you ever heard
of a place called the Hacienda?

30:55.887 --> 30:57.149
Yeah.

30:57.222 --> 30:59.884
Yes, I have.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.823
Why?

31:01.893 --> 31:03.827
Well, I'm just wondering.

31:03.895 --> 31:05.328
Just wondering.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.162
Did we ever spend
any time there together...

31:12.237 --> 31:13.795
you and I?

31:13.872 --> 31:17.330
Just the two of us?

31:17.408 --> 31:19.239
You and I?

31:19.310 --> 31:20.709
At the Hacienda?

31:20.778 --> 31:22.905
- Yeah.
- No.

31:22.981 --> 31:25.006
Oh. OK.

31:26.117 --> 31:27.641
It's all right.

31:29.487 --> 31:30.579
Thanks.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.920
$7,000?

31:42.066 --> 31:44.000
Can't you read? We're closed.

31:44.068 --> 31:48.164
I know, but I need to speak
to Mr. Klein about this.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.706
Oh, all right.

31:54.512 --> 31:57.538
You guaranteed me that once
this bird got to know me...

31:57.615 --> 31:59.674
it would talk!
I've had it for six months...

31:59.751 --> 32:01.582
and it hasn't
even opened its beak!

32:01.653 --> 32:03.416
I said that Clementine
could talk.

32:03.488 --> 32:05.285
I didn't say that she would!

32:05.356 --> 32:07.290
OK, I'm sorry. No problem.

32:07.358 --> 32:09.986
Sorry about your inconvenience.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.222
Silly old bitch!

32:13.298 --> 32:15.232
Yeah! You see?

32:15.300 --> 32:18.098
- Silly old bitch!
- What can I do for you?

32:18.169 --> 32:19.534
According to this invoice...

32:19.604 --> 32:21.629
I bought enough animals
to fill a zoo.

32:21.706 --> 32:23.640
$7,000... that's ridiculous.

32:23.708 --> 32:26.302
Merrick?

32:26.377 --> 32:27.810
Oh, Mr. Merrick!

32:27.879 --> 32:29.608
I didn't recognize you there.

32:29.681 --> 32:30.943
I had this bad car accident.

32:31.015 --> 32:33.643
Yeah, yeah. So I heard.

32:33.718 --> 32:35.652
- Sadie!
- Yeah?

32:35.720 --> 32:37.153
Close up the shop!

32:37.221 --> 32:40.156
Oh! And take another look around
for Betty June.

32:40.224 --> 32:41.486
Right.

32:41.559 --> 32:43.322
Come with me.

32:43.394 --> 32:44.986
Welcome home, sweetheart.

32:45.063 --> 32:46.655
Welcome home!

32:46.731 --> 32:48.892
Silly old bitch!

32:51.402 --> 32:52.869
There you go, honey.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.836
Poor old Twigs.

32:56.908 --> 32:59.775
He got hit by a car.
He's lost control.

32:59.844 --> 33:03.837
So, what did I buy
for seven grand? A gorilla?

33:03.915 --> 33:05.143
You don't remember?

33:05.216 --> 33:06.615
Oh, amnesia.

33:06.684 --> 33:08.743
I blacked out on everything
before the accident.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.983
Wow. That can be a tough one.

33:12.056 --> 33:15.321
I'm afraid all you bought
was a lot of my time.

33:15.393 --> 33:19.762
Some of my photographic art.

33:19.831 --> 33:24.564
I guess "gorilla"
wasn't too far off the mark.

33:24.635 --> 33:27.468
There was a guy named...

33:27.538 --> 33:28.800
Jack Stanton.

33:28.873 --> 33:31.671
He was doing a little
chimney sweeping with your wife.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.802
You hired me to stake him out
last Christmas.

33:33.878 --> 33:36.972
Holiday surcharge
and no lunch breaks...

33:37.048 --> 33:38.310
it all adds up.

33:38.383 --> 33:41.181
I sent you the contact strips
New Year's Eve...

33:41.252 --> 33:42.981
then I waited for my money.

33:43.054 --> 33:45.750
Just as I was beginning to
figure that I'd been stiffed...

33:45.823 --> 33:47.814
and I was gonna have
to use a little muscle...

33:47.892 --> 33:49.325
who shows up but Mrs. Merrick?

33:49.394 --> 33:51.862
- Mrs. Merrick?
- Yeah. Your wife.

33:51.929 --> 33:54.864
She paid your bill.
She's a nice lady.

33:54.932 --> 33:57.560
I got paid,
the animals got fed.

33:57.635 --> 33:59.535
You are a private investigator?

33:59.604 --> 34:03.563
Yeah, yeah.
I paid my dues for thirty years.

34:03.641 --> 34:07.168
You spend that long
peeping through keyholes...

34:07.245 --> 34:10.214
you kind of lose confidence
in the human species.

34:13.284 --> 34:18.051
Plus the hours and the food
and the bad vibes...

34:18.121 --> 34:20.851
kind of took a toll
on my health.

34:20.925 --> 34:24.326
Now I only do it to pay the rent
and feed the animals.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.091
Are you satisfied?

34:28.132 --> 34:29.860
Case closed?

34:29.934 --> 34:33.768
Let me put it this way,
Mr. Klein...

34:33.838 --> 34:35.772
don't you find it
a little odd...

34:35.840 --> 34:38.331
that on the same day
you gave me those pictures...

34:38.409 --> 34:40.877
my wife and I had
a terrible accident?

34:40.945 --> 34:42.913
She gets thrown out
with hardly a scratch...

34:42.980 --> 34:44.538
I wind up looking
like hamburger.

34:44.614 --> 34:47.708
What, you think
she planned it? Come on!

34:47.784 --> 34:50.947
Unless your wife
was into serious acrobatics...

34:51.022 --> 34:54.480
I'd say that your imagination
is working overtime.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.583
You want my advice? Forget it.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.391
OK, so she had an affair.

34:59.464 --> 35:02.956
You've never had an affair,
Mr. Merrick?

35:03.034 --> 35:06.492
Yeah. As a matter
of fact, I did...

35:06.571 --> 35:08.630
but I can't remember who with.

35:12.343 --> 35:14.140
That could keep a guy
on his toes.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.615
Look, Mr. Klein...

35:20.685 --> 35:25.122
I'd like to hire you again
to find out...

35:25.189 --> 35:27.419
a little bit more
about this Jack Stanton.

35:27.492 --> 35:29.790
And I'd be glad to take
your money, but...

35:29.861 --> 35:32.295
as I don't believe
in exploiting animals...

35:32.363 --> 35:34.797
occasionally
I get a little soft...

35:34.866 --> 35:37.130
and extend that code
to human beings.

35:37.201 --> 35:40.466
Look, the way I see it,
you both had an affair...

35:40.538 --> 35:43.063
and now you love each other.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.804
Great! Save your money.
Forget the guy.

35:48.179 --> 35:49.806
Kind of pretty, ain't he?

35:49.881 --> 35:51.974
He's not my type.

35:52.049 --> 35:54.279
Mr. Klein...

35:54.352 --> 35:56.115
don't move.

35:56.187 --> 35:58.815
There's a snake
right behind you.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.260
Oh, yeah... Betty June!

36:04.328 --> 36:05.920
I've been looking for you!

36:05.997 --> 36:07.157
Where you been, honey?

36:07.231 --> 36:08.425
Ain't she pretty?

36:08.499 --> 36:10.296
- Sadie!
- Yeah?

36:10.368 --> 36:12.893
- I found Betty June!
- Oh, good!

36:12.970 --> 36:15.097
Yeah. She was
in the filing cabinet.

37:13.531 --> 37:14.759
Dan?

37:18.803 --> 37:21.601
Maybe I should continue
the sessions with the shrink.

37:21.672 --> 37:23.731
Maybe Jeb's right...
just put a lid on the past.

37:23.808 --> 37:26.777
But what you said
about the accident...

37:26.844 --> 37:28.436
I can't let it go.

37:28.512 --> 37:31.276
It doesn't add up.

37:31.349 --> 37:33.283
I feel there's...

37:33.351 --> 37:35.114
something wrong here.

37:35.186 --> 37:37.211
Trust your feelings.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.222
What?

37:39.290 --> 37:41.053
Do you love Judith?

37:49.700 --> 37:51.133
I guess I do.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.669
She's sick.

37:54.405 --> 37:56.373
You do know that, don't you?

37:56.440 --> 37:59.807
She's the one who needs
a psychiatrist, not you.

37:59.877 --> 38:04.246
She's a pathological liar.

38:04.315 --> 38:08.149
She lies for the sake of lying.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.481
In seven years...

38:09.553 --> 38:12.579
she's never told me
the simple truth about anything.

38:12.657 --> 38:16.093
God, Dan,
it used to drive you crazy...

38:16.160 --> 38:18.754
especially when
you'd catch her in it...

38:18.829 --> 38:23.596
and she'd just coolly
start spinning another one.

38:23.668 --> 38:26.603
She thinks everybody's stupid.

38:26.671 --> 38:30.437
She can do anything
and get away with it.

38:30.508 --> 38:31.998
She's sick.

38:37.715 --> 38:40.309
What happened in Mexico
with Stanton?

38:40.384 --> 38:43.285
She's like a drug addict...

38:43.354 --> 38:45.322
completely hooked on him.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.952
And he's still around...

38:50.027 --> 38:51.961
believe me.

38:52.029 --> 38:54.156
Problem is, so are you.

38:56.734 --> 38:59.294
Dan, do you know
how much you're worth?

39:14.418 --> 39:17.319
You can't really see
how beautiful it is...

39:17.388 --> 39:18.855
with the lights on.

39:25.329 --> 39:26.887
Isn't that amazing?

39:30.668 --> 39:34.764
If only life could be
that perfect...

39:34.839 --> 39:36.534
that still.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.978
Oh, Dan...

39:49.053 --> 39:51.544
Danny...

39:54.859 --> 39:56.019
Oh, Jenny, no.

39:56.093 --> 39:57.617
Don't. Don't do this.

39:57.695 --> 39:59.663
We were lovers, Dan.

40:09.640 --> 40:10.868
The Hacienda?

40:10.941 --> 40:13.637
You remember.

40:13.711 --> 40:15.679
We were gonna get married.

40:15.746 --> 40:20.012
We were just waiting
for the right time.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.644
Jeb's not back till tomorrow.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.654
Make love to me now...

40:24.722 --> 40:25.814
here...

40:25.890 --> 40:28.085
just like we used to.

40:28.159 --> 40:32.493
I said... I said stop it.

40:32.563 --> 40:35.464
I don't remember.

40:35.533 --> 40:37.023
Can't you understand?

40:38.803 --> 40:40.236
Get out.

40:40.304 --> 40:42.067
Jenny, please...

40:42.139 --> 40:43.367
Get out!

41:05.696 --> 41:06.628
Hi, Jeb.

41:06.697 --> 41:08.597
Oh, Dan.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.634
Copying my homework?

41:11.702 --> 41:14.899
No, no. Just taking a look...

41:14.972 --> 41:16.997
at what you've been doing
while I've been gone...

41:17.074 --> 41:19.235
and it looks pretty good,
considering...

41:19.310 --> 41:20.607
Yes?

41:20.678 --> 41:23.408
Considering you have no idea
of what the fuck you're doing.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.449
Listen...

41:25.516 --> 41:28.280
I'm just not so sure...

41:28.352 --> 41:29.944
That I can handle it?

41:30.020 --> 41:32.147
No, I just think we have
some serious thinking to do...

41:32.223 --> 41:34.157
about what the next step is.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.886
That's precisely
what I've been doing...

41:35.960 --> 41:40.329
the last couple of days,
thinking about that.

41:40.397 --> 41:41.830
So...

41:43.534 --> 41:47.300
if you're ready
to buy out your partner...

41:47.371 --> 41:50.033
then he's ready to sell.

41:50.107 --> 41:53.702
Assuming we could
come up with a deal.

41:53.777 --> 41:56.245
I warn you, pal...

41:58.249 --> 41:59.841
I'll suck your blood.

41:59.917 --> 42:04.115
Well, like you say, Jeb...
in an unreliable world...

42:04.188 --> 42:06.383
it's nice to have somebody
who's consistent.

42:06.457 --> 42:07.446
Jeb?

42:07.525 --> 42:10.153
The men from the security
service are here.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.497
Some Greenpeace freaks
are trying to stop us...

42:13.564 --> 42:16.055
from shifting an old boat
off the marina site.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.896
Time to go knock
a few heads together.

42:17.968 --> 42:19.196
We'll talk.

42:20.304 --> 42:22.363
I'm really sorry, Dan.

42:22.439 --> 42:24.805
It's just that Jeb insisted,
and there was really nothing...

42:24.875 --> 42:26.069
No sweat.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.643
What do you want?

42:31.715 --> 42:33.046
Caffeine and no calls.

42:33.117 --> 42:34.550
Wait a minute,
you can't just come...

42:34.618 --> 42:36.176
Nancy, it's OK.

42:38.122 --> 42:40.056
I guess I owe you an apology.

42:40.124 --> 42:41.421
Oh, forget it.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.585
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe you was right.

42:43.661 --> 42:44.923
Oh, that's refreshing.

42:44.995 --> 42:47.930
After you left the store
the other night...

42:47.998 --> 42:50.933
I gave the whole business
another thought...

42:51.001 --> 42:55.495
and the more I ran it by,
the more I began figuring...

42:55.573 --> 42:58.167
maybe you wasn't
so far off base.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.107
You're a day late
and a few dollars short...

43:00.177 --> 43:02.372
Mr. Klein.

43:02.446 --> 43:03.845
You were right...

43:03.914 --> 43:05.211
Forget the guy.

43:05.282 --> 43:09.378
Oh, boy... am I in a fix.

43:12.156 --> 43:13.589
What is the problem?

43:13.657 --> 43:14.919
The guy!

43:14.992 --> 43:20.225
Look, I did a bit
of research on him.

43:20.297 --> 43:22.288
Let's start with the accident.

43:22.366 --> 43:23.594
Yeah?

43:23.667 --> 43:26.602
Now, you was driving
your car, right?

43:26.670 --> 43:28.570
- Right.
- Wrong.

43:28.639 --> 43:31.472
I checked with the hospital.
There's no way...

43:31.542 --> 43:34.841
that you could have received
these head injuries...

43:34.912 --> 43:37.608
if you were sitting behind
the wheel of a car.

43:37.681 --> 43:39.376
Next question...

43:39.450 --> 43:42.942
Was your wife even in the car
when it went over the edge...

43:43.020 --> 43:44.988
or could she have been
on terra firma...

43:45.055 --> 43:46.784
and given it a little nudge?

43:46.857 --> 43:49.951
Come on, Klein.
She's not Superman.

43:50.027 --> 43:52.552
Yeah, but how about
her and Stanton?

43:58.669 --> 44:01.069
How would you like your coffee?

44:01.138 --> 44:02.696
Oh. Two sugars...

44:02.773 --> 44:03.740
real sugar.

44:03.807 --> 44:06.935
And cream,
preferably from a cow.

44:07.011 --> 44:08.410
Oh, by the way...

44:08.479 --> 44:10.913
the typeface on your IBM...

44:11.015 --> 44:13.279
it wouldn't happen to be
Prestige Elite...

44:13.350 --> 44:15.147
by any chance, would it?

44:15.219 --> 44:17.278
Everybody's into
Courier 10 these days...

44:17.354 --> 44:19.288
but I still use...

44:19.356 --> 44:20.789
How'd you know that?

44:20.858 --> 44:23.793
You got Prestige Elite
written all over you.

44:29.867 --> 44:33.359
I tracked Stanton down
to the architect firm...

44:33.437 --> 44:35.803
he used to work for in L.A.

44:35.873 --> 44:39.775
They don't know where he is,
but I do.

44:39.877 --> 44:42.812
At least, I know where he was.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.815
Right here in this office...

44:45.883 --> 44:50.616
exactly 51/2 hours
after the accident.

44:53.390 --> 44:58.487
A copy of a fax
he sent to his boss.

44:58.562 --> 44:59.824
"Dear Paul...

44:59.897 --> 45:02.422
"I've finally decided
to take the plunge...

45:02.499 --> 45:06.060
"and go for that job in Tokyo.

45:06.136 --> 45:07.763
"I'm shipping out tonight...

45:07.838 --> 45:11.205
"so don't expect
to hear from me for a while.

45:11.275 --> 45:12.503
"Happy New Year."

45:12.576 --> 45:17.479
Sent from...
"Merrick/Scott No.04."

45:17.581 --> 45:22.541
That's your personal
fax machine... number 4.

45:25.689 --> 45:27.281
Time sent...

45:27.357 --> 45:29.291
8:04 A. M...

45:29.359 --> 45:31.293
January 1.

45:33.530 --> 45:37.159
Typeface... Prestige Elite.

45:47.177 --> 45:49.236
I take it your wife...

45:49.313 --> 45:51.110
had a set of keys
to this office, huh?

45:51.181 --> 45:53.206
But she was in a hospital,
for Christ's sake!

45:53.283 --> 45:54.910
No, she was not.

46:00.324 --> 46:02.690
Judith Merrick
discharged herself...

46:02.760 --> 46:07.163
from Marin County Hospital
at 6:18 A. M...

46:07.264 --> 46:09.926
January 1...

46:10.000 --> 46:12.059
31/2 hours after
she was admitted.

46:13.203 --> 46:14.261
No.

46:14.338 --> 46:15.771
It gets worse.

46:15.839 --> 46:17.773
Japanese immigration
has got no record...

46:17.841 --> 46:20.571
of a Jack Stanton
entering Japan.

46:20.644 --> 46:22.544
OK, he could be anywhere...

46:22.613 --> 46:24.478
but I'll bet you
dollars to doughnuts...

46:24.548 --> 46:26.607
the boy never left town.

46:28.318 --> 46:31.617
You're worth an awful lot
of money, Mr. Merrick.

46:31.688 --> 46:34.623
They tried to kill you once.

46:34.691 --> 46:36.989
Why not try it again, huh?

47:55.539 --> 47:56.471
Dan?

47:57.541 --> 48:00.442
Mr. Merrick's taking a nap.

48:00.510 --> 48:02.637
Any calls, Lydia?

48:02.713 --> 48:04.112
Yeah, just one.

48:04.181 --> 48:06.308
Said they'd call back later.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.578
Stan someone.

48:08.652 --> 48:09.744
Let's see...

48:09.820 --> 48:10.980
Jack Stanton.

48:14.992 --> 48:16.425
Did he...

48:16.493 --> 48:17.721
leave a number?

48:17.794 --> 48:20.524
No. Just that he's in town.

48:26.536 --> 48:27.662
Mrs. Merrick?

48:29.172 --> 48:30.434
Are you all right?

48:30.507 --> 48:31.940
Yes, Lydia.

48:32.009 --> 48:33.033
I'm fine.

48:33.110 --> 48:34.975
May I speak
to Gus Klein, please?

48:35.045 --> 48:36.478
Nah, he's delivering puppies.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.706
When will he be back?

48:37.781 --> 48:38.839
He's right here.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.247
Let me talk to him.

48:40.317 --> 48:43.184
I told you,
he's delivering puppies!

48:43.253 --> 48:44.652
God damn it,
this is important.

48:44.721 --> 48:47.986
Tell him Jack Stanton's in town,
he called my wife, and...

48:48.058 --> 48:50.083
Did you get all that?

48:50.160 --> 48:52.151
Yeah. The bitch just got him.

48:52.262 --> 48:53.354
What?

48:53.430 --> 48:54.897
The dog just bit Gus.

48:54.998 --> 48:56.932
Yeah, yeah, I'll tell him.

49:03.373 --> 49:06.570
Lydia, can I borrow your car
for a little while?

49:06.643 --> 49:08.270
My battery's dead.

49:08.345 --> 49:11.280
Sure, Mr. Merrick.
The keys are under the seat.

54:56.693 --> 54:58.126
Merrick residence?

54:58.228 --> 54:59.957
Hi, this is Laura
at Demo's Pharmacy.

55:00.030 --> 55:01.964
Just wanted to let you know that
Mr. Merrick's prescription...

55:02.032 --> 55:03.294
is ready to be picked up.

55:03.366 --> 55:04.833
That's not for us, Twigs.

55:04.934 --> 55:07.164
Patience, honey. Patience.

55:09.272 --> 55:12.207
Can't keep Firemouth
with Green Terror...

55:12.275 --> 55:14.038
when they're spawning.

55:16.479 --> 55:19.471
The rival females
try to kill each other.

55:19.582 --> 55:21.573
Oh, yeah...

55:23.520 --> 55:26.785
I did a little checking
on that old shipwreck.

55:26.856 --> 55:29.086
Interesting.

55:29.159 --> 55:32.856
It seems you guys are gonna have
quite a battle to get rid of it.

55:32.929 --> 55:36.262
Yeah. So, did you get
any phone calls?

55:36.333 --> 55:38.665
Sure. I had a great morning.

55:38.735 --> 55:42.262
I reread all of "Animal Farm."

55:44.274 --> 55:46.538
Did you ever read "Animal Farm,"
Mr. Merrick?

55:46.609 --> 55:48.975
Yeah, sure. George Orwell.

55:49.045 --> 55:51.639
Mr. Orwell's simple tale
of animals rising up...

55:51.748 --> 55:53.306
against their human oppressors.

55:53.416 --> 55:56.613
Boy, would I sing
to see that really happen.

55:56.686 --> 55:58.278
Take your ship, for instance.

55:58.388 --> 56:00.618
Do know what your guys
are gonna do with it?

56:00.690 --> 56:03.056
They're gonna tow it
a mile out of U.S. waters...

56:03.126 --> 56:05.594
and sink the sucker!

56:05.695 --> 56:07.390
The fact that it's full
of toxic waste...

56:07.464 --> 56:11.366
doesn't seem to bother anybody,
except, of course, the fish.

56:11.468 --> 56:15.165
But fish don't buy condos,
so who gives a shit?

56:15.238 --> 56:16.500
Hello?

56:16.573 --> 56:18.939
Is this Judith Merrick
of 114 Summit Way?

56:19.008 --> 56:20.066
Yes.

56:20.176 --> 56:22.872
This is Western Union
in San Rafael.

56:22.946 --> 56:25.744
We have a telegram for you
from a Jack Stanton.

56:25.815 --> 56:27.339
Do you want me to read it,
or should l...

56:27.450 --> 56:29.315
Yes, read it.

56:29.386 --> 56:31.149
"Unable to reach you
on the phone...

56:31.221 --> 56:32.483
"without interference.

56:32.555 --> 56:34.420
"lmperative I see you today.

56:34.491 --> 56:35.822
"Send telegram...

56:35.892 --> 56:38.588
"care of General Delivery,
San Francisco."

56:38.661 --> 56:40.458
Signed, "Jack."

56:41.765 --> 56:42.732
Dan.

56:46.836 --> 56:47.768
Jenny.

56:47.837 --> 56:49.065
I have to talk to you.

56:49.139 --> 56:51.073
There's something
I have to find out.

56:51.141 --> 56:52.199
Is Stanton in town?

56:52.308 --> 56:55.004
Yeah. He's been trying
to reach Judith.

56:55.078 --> 56:56.170
I knew it.

56:56.279 --> 56:58.372
Judith came over to see me
on some pretext...

56:58.481 --> 57:00.574
or rather, doing her
"best friend" routine.

57:00.683 --> 57:03.311
She's trying to find out
how much I know.

57:03.420 --> 57:05.888
She's ready
to make her move, Dan.

57:05.989 --> 57:09.857
She's got you right where
she wants you, like a child...

57:09.926 --> 57:12.690
no memory, no history.

57:14.964 --> 57:17.762
Why...

57:17.834 --> 57:20.530
Jenny, please.

57:20.603 --> 57:23.504
My God, this is so crazy.

57:26.342 --> 57:29.607
Well, she won't
get away with it.

57:36.653 --> 57:39.213
- Oh, jeez.
- Did you get my fax from L. A?

57:39.322 --> 57:40.755
Oh, yeah.

57:40.824 --> 57:43.190
Listen, tomorrow night,
soon as I get back into town...

57:43.259 --> 57:45.124
we sit down, dinner,
we hammer out a deal.

57:45.195 --> 57:47.220
OK, but what are we doing
with this shipwreck?

57:47.330 --> 57:50.299
Done! We dump it tomorrow.

57:50.400 --> 57:52.595
Oh, do me a favor.

57:52.669 --> 57:55.729
Keep your hands off
the office machines, huh?

57:57.307 --> 58:01.073
Dan, it's Mr. Klein on line 2.

58:01.144 --> 58:03.135
Hello?

58:03.246 --> 58:05.680
Hello, Mr. Merrick?
It's Gus Klein.

58:05.782 --> 58:07.545
Be outside in two minutes.

58:07.617 --> 58:09.141
Get ready for some action.

58:09.252 --> 58:10.549
Why? What happened?

58:16.759 --> 58:18.818
Aw... sorry.

58:18.928 --> 58:21.761
Nancy, do me a favor
and get a hold of...

58:21.831 --> 58:23.890
what's-his-name
down in site clearance?

58:24.000 --> 58:25.592
- Abe?
- Abe, yeah.

58:25.702 --> 58:27.567
Give him a call and tell him...

58:27.637 --> 58:30.765
to hold off moving
that old shipwreck tomorrow.

58:35.311 --> 58:36.676
You drive. I got to work.

58:36.746 --> 58:37.735
What's up?

58:37.847 --> 58:39.678
This. Come on.

58:39.749 --> 58:41.842
Let's get this machine
on the road.

58:46.055 --> 58:47.818
Golden Gate.

58:55.899 --> 58:57.867
Jack Stanton...

58:57.967 --> 58:59.400
care of General Delivery...

58:59.502 --> 59:00.901
San Francisco.

59:01.004 --> 59:02.596
And the message?

59:02.705 --> 59:03.672
"Dear Jack...

59:03.773 --> 59:07.038
"I was surprised
to hear from you.

59:07.110 --> 59:09.169
"If you're in some kind
of trouble...

59:09.279 --> 59:11.372
"I'll try and help.

59:11.481 --> 59:13.949
"But please understand...

59:14.050 --> 59:19.386
"my husband and I
are together again.

59:19.455 --> 59:22.686
"I'll meet you today, 5 P. M...

59:22.759 --> 59:24.693
"at our hotel."

59:26.396 --> 59:28.364
"At our hotel..."

59:28.464 --> 59:30.762
The Hacienda, right?

59:48.284 --> 59:50.514
My guess is,
whatever they're up to...

59:50.620 --> 59:52.212
they're up to in the bedroom.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.321
I'll follow them
and plant this outside...

59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.728
so we can monitor them
from the car.

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.699
Hey.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:23.051
What the fuck am I doing?

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:25.347
I'm looking through a lens.

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:38.593
OK, so now where's Romeo?

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:42.933
That's what he looked like
nine months ago.

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:44.438
Same location.

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:45.974
The same lens.

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.542
Great.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:55.348
Hey...

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:11.925
I was there, too, Dan.

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.935
A long time ago.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.873
You were married?

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:20.033
Yeah.

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.841
Yeah, right.

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:28.883
When it ended,
I was walking around...

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:32.318
feeling like I was a package
of broken glass.

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:44.926
Nice car.

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:47.662
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.136
1968 Dodge Coronet.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:53.698
212-thousand miles.

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:55.573
Its original engine.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:11.950
All right.

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:16.323
Yep, that's our boy.

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:20.459
OK, you stay here.

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.249
He's coming back out.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:45.426
Start her up, Dan.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.296
Roll it.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.604
You gonna open it?

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:06.266
Not unless you got the key...
it's padlocked.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.309
Well, how the hell
did he get through?

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:09.537
I don't know.

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.414
You OK?

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.614
Look what that son of a bitch
has done to my car!

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.999
Hey...

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:37.167
Take it easy!

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:38.535
This car's an antique!

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:40.302
You're telling me...
it drives like one!

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:06.223
Jesus!

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:14.400
You're gonna break her
to pieces!

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:25.682
Oh, no! Slow down, will you?

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.407
Well, get out of his way!

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:54.180
OK, you bastard,
you want it, you'll get it!

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:56.715
For Christ's sake, Dan!

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:58.150
Aw, fuck him!

01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:01.220
Oh, my God, we're done!

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:19.104
Oh, look.

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.800
Look at this.

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.451
Oh, shit.

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:33.945
I'm sorry.

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.797
Hey, I'm really sorry, Gus.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.495
I'll make it up to you.

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.878
Time for the cops, huh?

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.007
Yeah.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.018
But first I want to talk
to Judith on my own.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.280
You understand.

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:06.821
I just hope she does.

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:09.915
No, no,
I'm not talking revenge.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:14.190
I'm talking about the woman
who nursed me back to health.

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:16.924
I just don't understand...

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.499
I don't know...

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:22.832
why.

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:27.299
Spare yourself the pain.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:32.905
I spent years trying
to figure out what went wrong.

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:35.176
Got me nowhere.

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:42.751
I still need
to talk to her, Gus.

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:44.120
Yeah...

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.387
Just in case.

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:11.234
Freeze.

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.101
Don't move.

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:30.222
Jesus.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.988
There is no Stanton.

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.066
You shot him.

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:41.694
You were drunk, Dan.

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:44.932
At the Scotts' party,
we had a fight.

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:47.134
I made you take me home.

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:49.404
Then you went really crazy.

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:52.504
I ran upstairs
and locked myself in...

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:56.107
and called Stanton for help.

01:10:56.185 --> 01:11:00.178
He came over, and you...

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.655
we got rid of the body.

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:07.423
Then we had the accident.

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:10.329
No, I don't believe it.

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:12.390
Dan, I tried
to keep it from you...

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:14.834
but you hired
that damn detective again!

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.336
I had to play Stanton...

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:18.396
to convince him
that Stanton's still alive.

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:20.704
You tried to kill me today!

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.672
The shots I fired at you two
were only meant to scare you.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:28.512
Don't you see? We had
to get Klein off the trail.

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.347
What, am I going crazy here?

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.944
I saw both of you
go in that hotel.

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.455
You saw me go in.

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:37.287
I got changed, and then
I went out the back door...

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:38.883
where I had the Porsche parked.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:42.920
You dressed up like Stanton,
and you almost killed me.

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:46.365
Now you're telling me
that I killed Stanton.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.865
Wait a minute.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.034
"Before the accident."
That's what you said?

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:58.637
Yeah.

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.409
You fucking liar!

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.916
Jack Stanton was alive and well
and in my office...

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:05.385
sending a fax
five hours after the accident!

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:08.218
That was me! I sent the fax...

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:10.815
to make believe
Stanton was still alive.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:15.159
Why did you think I checked out
of the hospital so goddamn fast?

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:17.061
To start covering for you.

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:19.362
The first morning...

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:21.528
paying Stanton's bill
at the Hacienda...

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:23.036
sending the fax...

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:25.938
hiding his Porsche
in the garage...

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:32.178
and not knowing
if you were dead or alive...

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:34.613
but praying and, God,
working...

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:37.174
to protect you
if you were alive.

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:41.582
I love you, Dan.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:44.558
Haven't you learned
that much by now?

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:50.992
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.597
Nothing.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:57.662
But then
you brought back Klein.

01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:01.603
Don't you see?

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:06.637
You hired someone to find out
that you're a murderer.

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:10.708
You hired somebody to send you
to the gas chamber.

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:19.360
Why...

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:22.363
why didn't you tell me
any of this before?

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:23.728
In the hospital?

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:25.664
"Hi, Dan,
I brought you some roses.

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:27.497
"Oh, and by the way,
you're a murderer."

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:33.905
Dan, I was trying
to protect you...

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:38.847
to protect you
from your own memory.

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:42.543
I wanted a new start,
for both of us.

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:46.116
I wish to God
I'd died in that accident.

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:48.782
Oh, don't say that.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:51.052
We're in this together.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:57.821
We have to get
out of here... tonight.

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:02.097
Somebody out there
knows that Stanton's dead.

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.196
The phone call,
the first telegram...

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.207
that wasn't me.
That was somebody else.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.641
- Somebody who...
- Who?

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:14.815
I don't know.

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:16.817
But whoever it is...

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:20.321
they're trying to play
a rotten game with us.

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:22.983
Oh, I started to panic.

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:26.323
I went down to the wreck
where you...

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.863
Well, there's
not much left now.

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:31.859
Only...

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:35.335
Oh, thank God...

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:39.670
tomorrow they're finally dumping
that wreck and what's in it.

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:41.174
Judith...

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:46.806
I put a hold on that ship.
I told them not to move it.

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:52.043
How the hell was I supposed
to know what was in it?

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.088
Jesus Christ!

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:02.297
OK, we have to move now.

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:04.525
You throw whatever we need
into a suitcase.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.125
We can arrange for money to be
sent to us when we get there.

01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:09.534
I'll get the Porsche back to the
garage and pick up the Mercedes.

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.800
- No, I'm coming with you.
- Dan, we don't have time.

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.172
When I get back,
we have to be ready to leave.

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:16.302
You do the packing
and write a note to Lydia.

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:18.278
It can't look
as if we're running.

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:37.321
This is Jenny.
I want you to come over.

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:39.326
There's something
you have to know.

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.328
I can't tell you
over the phone.

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:43.227
It has to be one on one.

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:44.595
- I can't.
Listen...

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:47.260
if you don't come over
right now...

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:49.304
I'm calling the police.

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:57.801
Jenny!

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:03.682
Jenny, it's me, Dan!

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.879
Jenny,
open the goddamn door!

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:24.669
Hey.

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:43.484
I got a call from Jenny.

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:46.118
She told me to come over.

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:48.253
I found her like this.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.959
Yeah, I monitored the call.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.779
Sit down.

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:07.815
You're not going anywhere.

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.913
I had a little talk...

01:18:11.987 --> 01:18:15.354
with the valet parking man
at the Hacienda.

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:20.794
He told me...
the guy in the Porsche...

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.830
wasn't a guy at all.

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.498
What do you mean?

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:35.737
Where is she?

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.005
Who?

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:38.808
Oh, come on.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.314
I don't know. She left.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.248
Right.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:45.250
In Stanton's Porsche.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.788
I was watching.

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:52.418
So where does that leave
Mr. Stanton?

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:56.260
How the hell should I know?
Your guess is as good as mine.

01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:58.595
Really?

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.134
Well...

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:04.404
for what it's worth...

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:06.566
my guess is...

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:09.269
whatever's left of him...

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:12.279
is rotting
in that old shipwreck.

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:14.281
You see, Mr. Merrick...

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:17.375
my guess is
that you killed him...

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:19.420
the night
I sent you the pictures...

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:21.353
the night
you had the accident.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:22.754
My guess is...

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:25.384
your wife's been covering up
for you all along.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.893
And my guess is...

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:29.396
Jenny Scott somehow
put the pieces together...

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.591
and was threatening
to go to the cops.

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:34.191
- I didn't kill Jenny.
- What about Stanton?

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:36.203
Maybe I did.
Maybe that's the block...

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:38.000
the doctors are talking about.

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:41.770
Maybe I'm a raving psychopath,
but I can't remember!

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:45.904
I can't turn
a blind eye to murder.

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:47.380
I'm not asking you to.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:48.882
I'm just asking you
to give me a chance...

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.315
to let me remember
what happened.

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:51.750
Let me go inside
that ship... please.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:54.584
- Sheriff's department?
- Give me Lieutenant Lacey.

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.647
Oh, for God's sake, Gus.

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:58.420
If I did it, I'll pay for it.

01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:00.290
I'm not gonna run.
You can put me away.

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:02.227
Put me in a straitjacket,
the gas chamber...

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:03.924
but at least
give me a chance...

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:06.024
to remember what the fuck
it is I've done!

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:08.831
Yeah, this is Lacey.

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:13.170
Send a car to 1134
Lagunda Coast Highway.

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.265
Who is this?

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:15.502
There's been a murder.

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:16.942
Who's calling?

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:21.308
Hello?

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.422
Let's go.

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:43.829
Jesus!

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:48.836
We're gonna get a disease.

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:58.276
Come on.

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:02.350
Thanks.

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:04.902
Anything there?

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:18.856
It's Stanton.

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.793
It's me.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:55.159
Dan Merrick.

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.424
It's Dan Merrick.

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:03.864
Oh, God!

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.508
This is insane.

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:12.178
You must be...

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.141
Jack Stanton.

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.173
Jack Stanton.

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:45.678
I'm Jack Stanton.

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.772
What happened?

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:50.511
You must try
and remember what happened.

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.052
Don't back off.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.348
Come on. Come on.

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:55.555
What happened?

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:57.557
Try and remember.

01:24:57.625 --> 01:25:00.025
Oh, Jack.

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.188
I love you.

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.326
I love you.

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.935
Who killed Dan Merrick?

01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:19.377
You've got to remember.
Come on!

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:21.312
Who killed him?

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:23.850
She called me...

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:26.318
she called me
at the Hacienda.

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:28.821
For God's sake, Jack,
come quick.

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:30.323
Dan's crazy.

01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:31.323
He's drunk.

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:32.825
Help me.

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:34.919
Jack, help me.

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:36.964
Help me.

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:38.658
Move it.

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:41.224
You must remember.

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.236
Who killed Dan Merrick?

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:45.169
Who killed him?

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.674
I said open the door now!

01:25:47.742 --> 01:25:49.676
- No!
- Judith!

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:52.212
No! Get out!

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.474
You little whore.

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:56.073
You were fucking that bastard.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:57.618
I love him!

01:25:57.685 --> 01:26:00.176
You'll never see him again,
you little slut!

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:04.290
Get away from me.

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:06.293
I'm going to kill you!

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:07.623
Dan!

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:10.755
You're gonna pay
for what you've done to me!

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:15.600
Judith, don't!

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:42.329
Oh, God.

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:46.292
We gotta do something.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:47.766
Call the police.

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:50.065
- Oh, no, Jack.
- Listen to me...

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:53.938
No, you got to help me, please.

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:57.000
They'll lock me up,
throw me in jail.

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.807
Without you, I'll die.

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:01.207
It was Judith.

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:06.451
Thank God.

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:13.293
You were right.
She was driving.

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:15.022
I'd been drinking that night.

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:17.792
I'd left my wallet
in the hotel.

01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:19.230
She drove.

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:35.815
Whose idea was the ship?

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:38.818
Dan had told her about it.

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:42.185
She figured the chemicals
would dissolve the body.

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:45.792
Bad guess.

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:49.228
It's formaldehyde.

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:52.266
It's the best preservative
known to man.

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:56.335
Then the accident...

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:58.497
We head for Mexico now, tonight.

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:00.837
- Judith, what do you mean "we"?
- Of course we.

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:02.239
We're in this together.

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:04.835
We can't go loping off
into the sunset.

01:28:04.912 --> 01:28:06.379
Now you listen to me.

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:08.608
I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life...

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:12.119
With me? Jack, you have to.
You're part of this now.

01:28:12.186 --> 01:28:13.778
You planned it this way
from the beginning...

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:15.254
No, Jack, I didn't plan it...

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:18.019
but it happened.
Now you have no choice.

01:28:18.092 --> 01:28:20.287
I do! I'll let the cops
sort this out.

01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:21.851
- I'll take my chances.
- No!

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:24.591
I am out of your life.
Do you understand me?

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:26.725
Oh, Jack, don't say that.

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:28.564
You can't just
throw me away like that!

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:31.400
Jesus Christ, Judith!
What the fuck are you doing?

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.983
You OK?

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:55.793
I guess I gotta
call you Jack now, huh?

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:57.956
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:11.273
Gus!

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.654
So now you know.

01:29:20.722 --> 01:29:21.654
You're insane!

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:23.520
Gus!

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:26.116
- I had to do it.
- Gus!

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.855
He and Jenny
were the only ones who knew.

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:30.864
He's gone!

01:29:30.932 --> 01:29:33.093
Oh! Gus!

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:34.327
Come with me.

01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:38.038
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:40.267
We got to get him some help.

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:46.644
Judith, for Christ's sake!

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.807
He's dying down there.

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:56.014
I didn't want to hurt you.

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:03.123
Let's go, Jack.

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:07.227
It's a long ride.

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:14.807
Judith. Judith!

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:16.639
Jenny blew it.

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.406
She soon found out
you weren't Dan.

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:20.743
Your smell, your hands...

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.715
the lines on your palms.

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:24.877
She was going to the police.

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:27.318
I had to kill her.

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:30.520
After the accident...

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:32.388
when the doctors told me...

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.758
"Your husband
is in a deep coma..."

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.729
I knew it was crazy...

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:39.266
but I really had no choice.

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:43.297
Oh, my God.

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:46.272
What I went through
to make all this come true.

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:48.672
When we first met...

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:51.735
it was as if
I'd always known you.

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:52.780
Remember?

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:54.075
Yes, I remember.

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.216
Don't!

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:01.118
This is the California
Highway Patrol.

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:02.554
Pull to the side...

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:04.523
OK, Judith,
it's all over now.

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:07.561
- Stop the car!
- Because of a gun?

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:09.858
Pull over to the shoulder!

01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:11.421
I said stop the car!

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:13.865
Pull to the shoulder!
I repeat...

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:15.129
Forget Mexico.

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:17.068
I've got a better idea.

01:31:57.645 --> 01:31:58.737
You all right?

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:01.342
Gus.

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:04.684
How the hell did you...

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:06.447
I got my own tank.

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:09.289
You want a shot?

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:17.790
You all right, Mr. Merrick?

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:50.058
Let's go, Dan.

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:51.598
Come on.
