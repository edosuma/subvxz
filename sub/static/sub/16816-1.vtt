00:47.859 --> 00:49.955
Beverly Hills, California.

00:50.481 --> 00:53.102
The perfect marriage of beauty and money..

00:53.503 --> 00:55.543
Especially money..

00:55.666 --> 00:57.377
There is ten billion dollars

00:57.403 --> 00:59.358
tucked away in the banks here.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.247
Not bad for a population of only

01:01.273 --> 01:02.713
thirty-three thousand people.

01:02.936 --> 01:05.557
This whole place reeks!..of luxury.

01:06.295 --> 01:08.395
It's all about,
living the good life.

01:08.832 --> 01:10.368
Twenty million dollars anywhere

01:10.394 --> 01:12.128
else can buy you
a small country.

01:12.213 --> 01:14.067
Here,
you get a nice two bedroom.

01:14.293 --> 01:15.376
..No yard..

01:15.607 --> 01:17.744
More..If you're
prepared to pay for it.

01:18.388 --> 01:20.571
This place is a oasis!..

01:20.597 --> 01:22.824
In the middle of L.A sprawl.

01:23.267 --> 01:24.917
And it has It's
own city council.

01:25.117 --> 01:26.143
It's own mayor!

01:26.180 --> 01:27.803
And fire department.

01:28.085 --> 01:29.990
And of course...

01:30.091 --> 01:31.921
It's very own police force.

01:32.472 --> 01:35.162
Beverly Hills has about
a thousand lawyers.

01:35.285 --> 01:37.697
And..
 about as many gardeners..

01:38.022 --> 01:41.238
It's home sweet home to
movie stars and rock stars!

01:41.389 --> 01:43.060
Millionaires, Billionaires,

01:43.086 --> 01:45.787
Air-Oilmagnet and
japanese tycoons.

01:46.210 --> 01:47.444
And...

01:47.493 --> 01:48.847
A few crooks...

01:49.313 --> 01:51.955
Of course if your a
 Beverly Hills cop like me..

01:52.119 --> 01:54.159
You just can't afford to live here.

01:54.641 --> 01:56.076
Makes you think..

01:56.102 --> 01:57.427
Doesn't it?

05:48.007 --> 05:48.766
Thank you.

05:49.146 --> 05:49.905
Hey "Bat"

05:50.335 --> 05:52.089
Is Laura here yet?
-You bet.

05:53.415 --> 05:54.129
Tommy Boy!

05:57.505 --> 05:58.248
Chief..

05:58.274 --> 05:59.479
It's good to see you.
-Alright.

05:59.605 --> 06:00.576
How are you.
 -Good.

06:00.797 --> 06:02.126
Congratulations on your team.
-Thanks..

06:02.152 --> 06:04.047
Well, you know what they say.
 It's not whether you win or lose..

06:04.273 --> 06:05.438
It's whether you win.
-Yes..

06:06.147 --> 06:07.286
 Take care.
- See you later. -See you around.

06:07.329 --> 06:08.113
Mayor!

06:10.259 --> 06:11.137
Look out there.

06:11.526 --> 06:12.654
There is more heart..

06:12.980 --> 06:14.582
And more caring about the little guy.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.695
Here in Beverly Hills then
any other city in America.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.105
And It's all due too you.

06:20.530 --> 06:21.822
Oh, thank you Coach.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.650
Whould you join us, at my table.
-Uhh..No thank you.

06:25.485 --> 06:26.840
Laura is sitting with me.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.556
She's very brave.

06:29.732 --> 06:32.223
You know Mitchell,
 I still haven't given up, on the idea of..

06:32.449 --> 06:33.731
You being my father inlaw....

06:34.153 --> 06:35.955
My daughter was slumming.

06:37.361 --> 06:39.908
Why do you treat me like this,
 something wrong with my money..

06:40.534 --> 06:41.377
..I take it?

06:41.700 --> 06:44.149
You don't understand,
nothing is wrong with your money..

06:45.075 --> 06:46.048
..It's you!

06:46.790 --> 06:48.517
Your in the insurance
business, Mitchell..

06:49.643 --> 06:51.528
That's the fucking
protection market.

06:52.254 --> 06:54.010
You sell fear and paranoia.

06:54.419 --> 06:56.404
You see it that way?

06:58.349 --> 07:00.296
Oh..The local clurgie..

07:01.522 --> 07:04.557
Is giving "Rushmore"
a trend load of shit about your "Wall".

07:05.900 --> 07:09.241
I'm afraid the board is going to
ask me, to cancel your policy.

07:10.298 --> 07:11.084
Excuse me.

07:19.921 --> 07:20.956
Everything alright?

07:21.822 --> 07:22.826
Under control.

07:23.050 --> 07:24.149
Where's Boomer?

07:24.575 --> 07:25.747
Not here yet.

07:26.756 --> 07:27.960
Get him over here.

07:34.242 --> 07:36.660
Excuse me, are you shooeing
these people away from here?

07:36.686 --> 07:38.197
You're saying they
can't shop in here?

07:38.379 --> 07:40.507
Sir,you have no idea
who these people are.

07:40.533 --> 07:44.039
This is..Michael Jackson, Warren
Beatty and Jack Nicholson.

07:44.039 --> 07:44.873
Kelvin!

07:45.299 --> 07:46.571
Go over to Boomer Hayes house.

07:46.597 --> 07:48.810
And bring him back here..

07:49.236 --> 07:50.234
You got that!

07:51.217 --> 07:52.026

07:52.852 --> 07:54.635

 Get your ass in the fucking car.

07:54.861 --> 07:56.265
Get Hayes back here now!

07:56.491 --> 07:58.832
Or I'm gonna fucking drill
you, where you stand.

07:58.858 --> 07:59.742
Can you understand that much!

08:00.020 --> 08:01.128
Is that a gay-fuck sir?

08:01.354 --> 08:03.035
Get going
 and get him over here right now!

08:03.615 --> 08:04.655
Varney!..

08:05.281 --> 08:06.874
It's a party..
What's all the shouting about?

08:07.962 --> 08:09.282
Chief Healy.
- Hmm.

08:09.808 --> 08:11.602
Well Mr Masterson wants Boomer

08:11.628 --> 08:14.557

Kelvin over here, to get him.

08:14.647 --> 08:17.108
Yeah..Well,they can hear you
all the way to Pacoima.

08:17.134 --> 08:18.539
So could you keep it down.

08:18.571 --> 08:19.784
Yeah..
Right, Chief.

08:19.910 --> 08:20.978
God..
What a moron.

08:22.511 --> 08:24.242
Probably a test-tube baby.

08:24.268 --> 08:25.997
You can tell by the shape of his head.

08:26.279 --> 08:28.625
Now..Varney, I know how
you love getting dressed.

08:28.651 --> 08:30.451
up like this with these
little shindigs...

08:30.459 --> 08:32.215
Yeah!
 It ain't exactly police work.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.755
What are you telling me?
 You miss being a cop?

08:34.756 --> 08:37.414
On the security business, you
get paid too pamper the rich.

08:37.432 --> 08:38.520
Aha! Well..

08:39.046 --> 08:41.366
You know you can do it
 without shouting in there faces.

08:43.025 --> 08:45.419
Well, I can shout all I God
damned want too Chief!

08:45.445 --> 08:47.297
Cause I'm not one of
your boys...No more!.

08:50.797 --> 08:51.997
I keep that in mind..

08:58.174 --> 08:58.951

09:06.799 --> 09:08.225

09:08.538 --> 09:10.729

 but it is obviously contagious.

09:11.355 --> 09:12.240
Let's go!

09:12.266 --> 09:13.507
Okay!
 But you have too help me.

09:14.413 --> 09:16.866

09:22.117 --> 09:23.945
Ahh..Nothing..
They wanna see you up there.

09:24.571 --> 09:26.294
So, Masterson sends a cop!

09:27.792 --> 09:29.901
I tell you.. why don't you
do yourself a favour.

09:30.045 --> 09:31.552
Why don't you tell these people.

09:31.578 --> 09:33.762
That your job is to protect
and serve and not to fetch!

09:33.834 --> 09:35.707
Why don't you tell them?
They won't fire you.

09:35.872 --> 09:36.805
Okay..

09:37.631 --> 09:39.639
"Kelvin"..

09:43.843 --> 09:46.178
Oh, Yeah..

successful day for us.

10:27.853 --> 10:29.971

He scares the Hell out of me..
Okay!

11:21.340 --> 11:22.778
Any more of these playing games,

11:22.879 --> 11:24.421
If you were smart,
you would have made me your ally.

11:24.547 --> 11:25.666
But that's over.

11:26.249 --> 11:27.386
Well,

Or you find yourself playing

11:50.783 --> 11:52.839
How many seasons

11:53.062 --> 11:55.287
You know you're not gonna be

11:55.413 --> 11:57.972
Prime meat that was kissed off
because it was too much trouble.

11:58.206 --> 11:59.025

12:58.112 --> 13:00.144
You wanna help celebrate

Why not and sink that way.

13:08.712 --> 13:10.243
Where do you think you're going?

13:11.987 --> 13:13.658
I've been there Hayes..

13:14.084 --> 13:15.876
Only money climbs that mountain.

13:16.302 --> 13:17.197
We'll see...

13:29.068 --> 13:29.926
Listen..

13:30.052 --> 13:32.235
I'm meeting your mum in New York,
 you want to join us?

13:32.263 --> 13:34.320
No! you're meeting the
"Rushmore" board in New York.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.080
You need someone to
keep mum from shopping.

13:36.957 --> 13:37.954
Please!...

13:38.580 --> 13:40.777
Dad, I have meetings,
 I can't get out off.

13:40.803 --> 13:42.378
You have a safe flight.

13:44.644 --> 13:45.661
Excuse me!..

13:46.587 --> 13:48.812
Excuse me..
Hi..Hi, I'm Boomer Hayes.

13:48.838 --> 13:50.486
 I know.
-And you are?

13:50.844 --> 13:53.487
Trying to leave unmolested.
- Ha! Ha!

13:54.275 --> 13:56.258
I bet he gets it, he
always gets what he wants.

13:56.384 --> 13:57.686
Fifty bucks says
nothing happens.

13:57.812 --> 13:59.891
 Who really cares.
- I'm with Coach.

13:59.917 --> 14:00.646
- I take it.

14:01.349 --> 14:02.613
What do you want?

14:03.939 --> 14:05.801
I wanna
 spend some time with you.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.613
Too see if I like..
Spending time with you?

14:09.672 --> 14:11.761
Believe me ,
we've already done that.

14:12.587 --> 14:14.282
Well..
Can you at least be specific.

14:16.058 --> 14:18.325
Allright Mr Hayes,
 you have a Jocks reputation.

14:18.951 --> 14:20.257
Your inventile..

14:20.358 --> 14:22.722
Self-centered with a
expectation of erculate.

14:22.948 --> 14:24.468
Simple because you exist.

14:25.475 --> 14:27.404
You are rich without a
sense of obligation.

14:28.207 --> 14:29.817
And you arrived at it,
 because of..

14:30.343 --> 14:33.550
An intensely coordinated wrong.
That in all likelihood.

14:33.776 --> 14:35.408
Stood and wave emotional
developments..

14:35.434 --> 14:36.127
Specific enough?

14:36.891 --> 14:38.341
Yeah!
 that's pretty close.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.507
But what about this..

14:41.133 --> 14:42.439
This is bullshit!

14:43.637 --> 14:44.906
Oh..You raise a few bucks.

14:45.032 --> 14:47.323
You put these people in shelters,
 you think your a saint.

14:48.332 --> 14:49.384

You seem very interesting about,..
A man that owns a football team.

17:50.050 --> 17:51.059
It's very...

17:52.385 --> 17:53.622
..American....

17:54.439 --> 17:55.488
No It's not..

17:56.114 --> 17:58.414
 Playing is very
American...Owning..

17:59.040 --> 18:00.895
It's just being rich.

18:02.305 --> 18:04.990
He's a sad person.
get's very frustrated.

18:06.116 --> 18:09.420
He couldn't sit
 like this and just talk.

18:10.221 --> 18:12.187
Can't help himself, He...

18:13.013 --> 18:14.134
Rushes everthing.

18:41.153 --> 18:41.801
Hey!

18:41.827 --> 18:42.525
 Sir!..Sir!

18:42.751 --> 18:44.296
Are you wearing a condom?

18:44.322 --> 18:45.136

18:45.162 --> 18:48.478
No I didn't think so...

19:00.910 --> 19:02.831
Yeah well..

19:02.857 --> 19:04.975
Playing football,
 and playing Quarterback.

19:05.908 --> 19:08.163
The whole trick for me is
not too get knocked down.

19:08.489 --> 19:10.380
I really hate getting knocked down!

19:11.106 --> 19:13.651
And I wanted to prove to
everybody that I wasn't a cloth.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.917
And I liked seeing all the other
guy's getting knocked around too.

19:17.143 --> 19:18.207
Because
 at least that way I didn't feel.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.711
 I was the only one!

19:22.314 --> 19:24.242
So..
There..now you know!..

a few times today..

20:15.570 --> 20:16.742
Listen...

20:20.168 --> 20:22.039
We've got a couple of hours
 left on our deal.

20:24.138 --> 20:26.102
You think,

20:29.075 --> 20:31.758

20:34.180 --> 20:36.982

38:18.656 --> 38:20.873
Trick out a toxic spill in
 Beverly Hills..

38:21.201 --> 38:22.630
It's own jurisdiction.

38:23.556 --> 38:24.941
Slap up a couple of roadblocks.

38:25.067 --> 38:26.710
Nobody want's to go near
a toxic spill..

38:27.336 --> 38:29.730
Clear the neighbourhood and...

38:31.715 --> 38:35.469

39:02.936 --> 39:05.591
I got them on the buses..
Quickly, Quietly.

39:05.817 --> 39:08.327
Told a few jokes, kept them relaxed.
It is what I was supoposed to do !

39:08.353 --> 39:09.874
But I don't know why I can't
do the rest of it..

39:12.784 --> 39:13.730

39:22.053 --> 39:23.578
We got to get to the outside..

39:25.104 --> 39:26.640

happening here.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.947
Were gonna die here!

39:30.871 --> 39:33.152
I am not loading myself up with Cortisol.

39:35.058 --> 39:37.281
So.. I can just
 sit around and wait here to get killed.

39:37.407 --> 39:38.159
 Yeah right!

39:38.185 --> 39:39.328
Better
 then to get killed out on the street.

39:39.354 --> 39:40.221
-Hey!..

39:40.522 --> 39:41.932
I'm a master of moving down field.

39:41.958 --> 39:43.156
And they don't know I'm in the game.

39:43.182 --> 39:45.050
You're one guy!!
- I'm two guys, Kelvin..

39:45.376 --> 39:47.862
You're coming with me,now I don't
know anything about guns..

39:48.880 --> 39:50.653
And we got to get into L.A.

39:51.267 --> 39:52.593
That's our goal..

39:53.617 --> 39:56.374
We won't make it out of the yard..
 -Well, we're gonna try!!

39:57.393 --> 39:59.018
I am not trained for this stuff.

39:59.244 --> 40:00.839
So you just got drafted!!

40:05.126 --> 40:07.338

40:09.200 --> 40:09.743
Come on!

40:11.606 --> 40:13.989
Where the Hell is our two boys?
 -They left that door open.

40:18.712 --> 40:21.029
They better have any more then a
battering-ram to get through this door.

40:21.155 --> 40:22.102
I... I got to tell you something.

40:22.728 --> 40:23.634

42:22.273 --> 42:23.801

42:23.827 --> 42:24.614
 I think were okay.

42:24.840 --> 42:25.509

44:20.257 --> 44:23.048
No, he...didn't come with you?
 -No, not on the same bus.

I had them open the shops.

44:47.897 --> 44:49.378

48:34.373 --> 48:35.629
-If I anticipated this...

48:36.255 --> 48:38.221
-I would have build more rooms
for the hotel.

48:38.259 --> 48:40.519
-You should have build a kennel
 for all these stinking dogs!

48:40.920 --> 48:42.092
-What I would like to know..

48:42.118 --> 48:44.093
-What the Hell the truck was doing
on our street in the first place!

48:44.219 --> 48:44.837
- Thank you.

48:44.956 --> 48:46.534
-I don't know, I wish
 I could tell you.. I wish..

48:46.660 --> 48:47.815
-I really wish, I could..

48:47.856 --> 48:49.621
Our evacuation bus,
 drove by that truck.

48:49.847 --> 48:51.349
 You know there were dogs around it!

48:51.985 --> 48:52.847
What's you're point?

48:53.473 --> 48:55.947
Well if this gas so poisonous,
wouldn't animals avoid it.

48:56.176 --> 48:59.017
I don't know?
Not all dogs are smart as Benji.

48:59.243 --> 49:01.117
No, on the contraire animals
 have a very keen sense.

49:01.143 --> 49:02.883
Of a disrupted environment.

49:03.301 --> 49:05.652
One wiff of fluorine
 would send the dumbest dog running.

49:05.978 --> 49:06.969
 What
are you saying.

49:07.095 --> 49:08.109
 It's not fluorine!

49:08.435 --> 49:10.079
I assumed you manufactured contraceptives.

49:10.980 --> 49:11.884
 Yes!..

49:12.210 --> 49:14.146
Well that's sort
of a big leap to chemical spills.

49:14.172 --> 49:15.007
Don't you think.

49:15.108 --> 49:16.678
Well you have heard of..
Checkmate haven't you.

49:17.204 --> 49:18.109
As in matter of fact..

49:18.235 --> 49:20.031
I produced a patented spermicite
 which I developed.

49:20.691 --> 49:22.899
Prior to being a C.E.O. I was a biochemist.

49:23.025 --> 49:24.624
I didn't know you were a biochemist?

49:24.750 --> 49:26.333
 I tell you something else,
you don't know..

49:26.968 --> 49:29.792
At a rate a dog metabolises
inhaling fluorine would...

49:30.318 --> 49:32.505
Kill it, before it got to
it's nose to it's lungs.

49:32.723 --> 49:35.149
So..you're confident enough to put
on suit and go in there.

49:35.475 --> 49:36.665
With the proper tools..yeah.

49:36.891 --> 49:38.474
Wait, were not sending
anybody in there.

49:38.600 --> 49:40.353
So, we just ignore the
fact that the E.P.A.

49:40.379 --> 49:41.574
Is telling us that this is...

49:41.675 --> 49:44.247
 I don't think the E.P.A. knows
what the Hell it's talking about.

49:44.398 --> 49:46.436
Listen, I have been here all night
and haven't even seen the E.P.A.

49:46.562 --> 49:47.859
Well, how the Hell long
you're gonna wait for them!

49:48.021 --> 49:49.129
Why don't you shove a little hot air.

49:49.355 --> 49:50.517
And talk loud enough,
everbody will hear you.

49:50.718 --> 49:51.843
 Pfft..
I wish he would.

49:51.938 --> 49:53.576
Look Tobea,
 I have a suite upstairs.

49:53.602 --> 49:55.379
You can go there,
 rest, wash up if you want.

49:55.780 --> 49:57.718
 I'm not going anywhere.
-Good idea Tobea!

49:58.444 --> 50:00.249
Well..then I just
have them bring a key.

50:00.275 --> 50:02.234
Incase you change you're mind.
-Excuse me.

50:02.260 --> 50:04.653
I'm staying right here!
-Alright, stay here Quietly!

50:05.301 --> 50:06.087
Excuse me.

50:06.913 --> 50:07.751
Sure thing.

50:08.477 --> 50:09.711
- Do you know how to play Gin?

50:09.837 --> 50:11.106
No I don't,
 but I wanna tell you..

50:11.232 --> 50:12.846
My wife,
 really likes you're products.

50:12.972 --> 50:14.461
I'm glad
you're still having fun.

50:17.645 --> 50:20.448
Come on boys were on the clock,
 lets double time it!

50:20.674 --> 50:22.049
We aint got all night.

50:22.075 --> 50:24.531
This is the department shine,
 let's leave these joints empty!

50:28.115 --> 50:30.318
Let's use those yellow smoke grenades!
That white smoke.

50:30.344 --> 50:31.946
Was that god-damned
boy scout jamboree.

50:32.172 --> 50:33.585
I want the people know.

50:33.611 --> 50:35.290
Of the city high
rises to think.

50:35.316 --> 50:36.847
We got a toxic spill
going on here..

50:36.873 --> 50:38.569
I want them too shit bricks!!
- Yes Sir.

50:40.101 --> 50:41.602
- Attention,
clear this site..

50:53.528 --> 50:54.517
We gotta get a
car.

50:54.943 --> 50:57.056
A bunch of rent-a-cars..
just down the block.

50:57.082 --> 50:58.572
 How do we get
through that gas.

50:58.598 --> 50:59.525
 Don't worry it's fake.

50:59.951 --> 51:01.909
- Okay we go on
three, you're ready..

51:02.910 --> 51:05.546
One...Two...Three!

51:11.021 --> 51:12.227
What the Hell was that?...

51:12.953 --> 51:13.905
It's them..

51:14.590 --> 51:16.135
That's that Boomer piece
of garbage!..

51:16.161 --> 51:18.026
Come on let's move it,
 move it!

51:19.152 --> 51:19.772
Go..go..go!!

51:26.262 --> 51:28.899
We got to get to the real cops.
- There too many guards!

51:36.282 --> 51:37.130
What are you doing?

51:45.842 --> 51:46.510
Which one!..

51:46.536 --> 51:47.600
How about the Lamborghini.

51:47.626 --> 51:48.964
No!..no..
 the white Rolls Royce.

51:49.065 --> 51:50.084
it's the closest one!

51:50.610 --> 51:52.271
At least we die in luxury.
- Here it is..

51:56.082 --> 51:56.697
Here!

52:00.711 --> 52:02.698
It doesn't work!..
It's the wrong set of keys!

52:02.724 --> 52:03.846
 Down there...down there!!

52:07.226 --> 52:09.200
Can you cover me,
 I'm getting closer to the car.

52:09.226 --> 52:09.950
Are you kidding!

52:42.743 --> 52:43.316
Kelvin!!

53:04.279 --> 53:04.828
- George!..

53:05.954 --> 53:06.541
-George!..

53:07.267 --> 53:07.776
-George!..

53:08.652 --> 53:10.938
- Okay, George come

53:15.364 --> 53:15.923

53:17.008 --> 53:17.599
-Six..

53:20.762 --> 53:21.915
-Yeah!..Whoo-hoo..

53:21.941 --> 53:23.747
-I love you baby!..
I love you baby!

53:30.088 --> 53:31.356
You did good, Kelvin..
Thanks.

53:33.549 --> 53:35.413
I got too stop for a minute.
-What for?

53:35.439 --> 53:36.575
 I got to figure out...

53:37.000 --> 53:38.341
How to break out of Beverly..

53:38.867 --> 53:40.465
We never make it through
the roadblock.

53:40.566 --> 53:42.376
 You didn't think we
make it out of the yard!

53:42.620 --> 53:44.044
I suppose,
we can't sit this out?

53:56.870 --> 53:58.151
-Are you ready!..
I'm coming in!

54:01.293 --> 54:03.017
Well, Mount Rushmore is
getting hammerd..

54:03.843 --> 54:06.341
Coming up on the Quarter of a..
billion dollars.

54:06.667 --> 54:09.019
That will be one unhappy insurance
company in the morning.

54:09.245 --> 54:11.333
 See now were way...
past cherry-gloss.

54:22.275 --> 54:23.971
I'm gonna make it
real simple for you..

54:24.397 --> 54:26.574
 Benitez..Don't say a
god-damned thing, because nobody,

54:26.600 --> 54:28.821
Understands half
the shit you say anyway!

54:29.266 --> 54:31.069
I want you too organize a
grid search..

54:31.395 --> 54:33.805
I want you to find these two fucking
idiots..and kill them!

54:34.459 --> 54:35.273
Benitez..

54:36.704 --> 54:37.785
If you fuck up this time.

54:38.011 --> 54:39.809
You be the deadest hitman in
 Beverly Hills.

54:40.210 --> 54:41.888
 Because
I'm gonna kill you myself!

54:57.243 --> 54:58.788
Do you know who's place this is..

54:59.462 --> 55:00.813
Yeah,
 I know who's place it is.

55:01.753 --> 55:04.073
I hope you guys did it over,
 real good too.

55:04.154 --> 55:05.097
My guys!!

55:10.174 --> 55:11.714
Thanks a lot..
My guys!

55:11.864 --> 55:15.143
-Delta fox to foxtrot,
direct code complete on Camden drive.

55:16.275 --> 55:18.795
-working to lock...
sector 5 through 6.

55:19.434 --> 55:21.093
-Copy that 3-9.

55:27.137 --> 55:28.107
It's okay.

55:29.333 --> 55:30.479
That's a relieve..

55:36.109 --> 55:37.392
Things can't be that bad.

55:37.818 --> 55:39.109
How much worse can it get?

55:42.363 --> 55:43.631
Things might be looking up.

56:00.236 --> 56:02.215
All drinks for free
after 8 o'clock.

56:32.008 --> 56:33.390
And you've all ready
been briefed.

56:33.616 --> 56:36.345
Just be uhh..
Observative, authoritative.

56:36.771 --> 56:38.410
You suppose to be
 an E.P.A. man right?

56:38.736 --> 56:39.335
 Right!

56:39.461 --> 56:39.998
 Okay..

56:40.424 --> 56:41.817
So..
go up and sound like one.

56:43.265 --> 56:43.789
Sound like..

56:44.215 --> 56:45.824
You don't know what
you're talking about.

56:45.950 --> 56:48.511
This way, he's gonna believe
 that you work for the government.

57:14.739 --> 57:15.345
Damned.

57:38.518 --> 57:40.127
Jeez!...
 He's gone.

57:44.676 --> 57:47.179
-Dragon head, dragon head,
 double sweep to Beverly drive.

57:47.205 --> 57:49.824
-And slug and contact.
we use 7.

57:52.934 --> 57:53.805
What are you doing?

57:54.529 --> 57:56.363
You...
Are gonna love this.

57:58.712 --> 57:59.783
You are gonna love this..

57:59.909 --> 58:03.101
You know this car
cost a 155,000 bucks!

58:04.227 --> 58:05.782
So what!
-Well, my house didn't cost..

58:05.908 --> 58:07.924
A 155,000 bucks.
- Well...

58:08.909 --> 58:10.717
Can't drive your house,
 can ya?

58:11.602 --> 58:13.402
Yeah,
a house is very difficult to park.

58:14.960 --> 58:16.202
Smell this leather.

58:16.990 --> 58:19.129
I've been smelling this
stuff for twelve years.

58:21.198 --> 58:23.697
Every day passing shops,
 you've have to be buzz-in too.

58:26.207 --> 58:27.894
Sometimes you think what about me..

58:28.820 --> 58:31.623
I put in the time, I risk my life
how about little good life for me!

58:33.511 --> 58:35.440
After driving a flaming
seeming valet.

58:35.466 --> 58:37.393
You afford a tracked home
no bigger then this.

58:38.343 --> 58:40.190
And every week some
citizen reminds me.

58:40.216 --> 58:41.985
That nowhere
else in America.

58:42.011 --> 58:43.725
Are cops paid as well
as they are here..

58:43.751 --> 58:45.208
Well big fucking deal!

58:47.940 --> 58:49.347
This is nowhere else in America.

58:49.673 --> 58:51.379
This is famous Beverly Hills.

58:53.280 --> 58:55.611
A depository for the world's greed.

58:57.941 --> 59:00.111
Some of that greed rubbed off,
 what do you expect.

59:04.462 --> 59:05.740
I met this woman tonight..

59:07.878 --> 59:08.817
And I realize...

59:10.643 --> 59:13.136
I never had a adult relationship
 in my whole life.

59:16.689 --> 59:17.482
You married?

59:18.008 --> 59:20.182
Nah..my wife left me...

59:21.708 --> 59:22.820
For a dentist.

59:24.089 --> 59:25.876
Probably better at
oral sex or something.

59:29.102 --> 59:31.979
Well..
we're both selfish man.

59:34.331 --> 59:36.273
Except,
 I'm going to jail for it.

59:42.226 --> 59:43.496
Hey,
you're right..

59:45.825 --> 59:47.285
I am selfish.

59:48.376 --> 59:50.409
Let's go!
-Okay..

01:00:09.157 --> 01:00:10.092
-Running loose where!

01:00:10.418 --> 01:00:11.746
-We haven't tracked them yet.

01:00:12.056 --> 01:00:13.698
Well..find out where
and get back too me.

01:00:13.724 --> 01:00:15.027
Hello. Gentlemen,
where are we.

01:00:15.053 --> 01:00:17.449
Uhh,.. 45 minutes..463,000
million U.S.

01:00:17.675 --> 01:00:18.984
 And we have a problem.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.081
There is a renegade
 and he's hooked up with a civilian.

01:00:21.461 --> 01:00:23.910
Calculating lost of men power,
 were 19 minutes behind.

01:00:32.876 --> 01:00:34.574
Boy!..
I can hardly wait to see the look.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.697
On there faces when we die,
 right in front of them!

01:00:43.937 --> 01:00:45.457
I can't get through!.
It's him again!

01:00:47.183 --> 01:00:48.239
Move!! move!..

01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:54.453

-Go!..Go!..

01:00:54.479 --> 01:00:55.339
 Put me out!!

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.377
Put..Put me out!!..

01:00:58.561 --> 01:01:00.272
Piece of garbage!
- Are you all right man?

01:01:00.498 --> 01:01:01.283
Come on!

01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:02.876
Move it! let's go!!
-Okay, let's go.

01:01:02.902 --> 01:01:03.579
Get in there!

01:01:10.769 --> 01:01:12.100
Okay...okay.

01:01:13.826 --> 01:01:15.908
We've got one decanter..
two glasses..

01:01:16.834 --> 01:01:18.387
Three napkins and a
half can of gas.

01:01:18.413 --> 01:01:19.640
Yeah,
well you know what they've got..

01:01:19.866 --> 01:01:21.268
 Will you forget
 what they've got!!

01:01:22.469 --> 01:01:23.046
Sorry!

01:01:24.072 --> 01:01:25.365
Forget what they've got..

01:01:28.997 --> 01:01:29.580
Get Varney.

01:01:31.406 --> 01:01:32.576
Move to primary target.

01:01:34.602 --> 01:01:35.746
-Move to the primary target

01:01:37.055 --> 01:01:38.591
-Were going into
 the fourth Quarter.

01:01:41.417 --> 01:01:42.700
-Were moving up the clock.

01:01:44.126 --> 01:01:44.823
-This is Field.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.989
You've got two loose cannons..

01:01:47.315 --> 01:01:48.981
So were moving to
primary target.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.956
What!
were not half done.

01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:52.583
Don't be so greedy.

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:54.339
We've already got 500,000 million.

01:01:54.683 --> 01:01:55.792
That's Masterson?

01:01:56.118 --> 01:01:57.623
Yeah..
we can't forget the two heroes.

01:01:58.039 --> 01:01:59.015
Just forget about them.

01:01:59.831 --> 01:02:01.250
There not getting past
the roadblock.

01:02:01.476 --> 01:02:02.690
So, just close this thing up.

01:02:02.899 --> 01:02:04.473
One of them is number 12.

01:02:07.433 --> 01:02:09.938
Hey! "Bat",
 we've just by your house..

01:02:10.264 --> 01:02:11.328
Nobody was home.

01:02:13.669 --> 01:02:15.384
"Hopalong"...
Come on over.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:17.501
We negotiate you're
uhh..new contract.

01:02:17.748 --> 01:02:19.343
Where are you "Bat"
the evac.

01:02:20.564 --> 01:02:22.139
We can be there in a couple of minutes.

01:02:22.162 --> 01:02:23.876
Boomer..
don't be such a idiot.

01:02:24.902 --> 01:02:26.004
You sit this thing out.

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:27.810
You're not gonna have too worry about
you're ankle.

01:02:27.936 --> 01:02:29.782
Or anything else..
for the rest of your life.

01:02:30.402 --> 01:02:31.176
What do you say?

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:35.422
-Moving up to 20 minutes..
and onto primary target.

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:39.838
Varney..

01:02:40.064 --> 01:02:42.529
Find that misguided son of a bitch!..
and kill him.

01:02:42.728 --> 01:02:43.716
Roger that!

01:02:45.506 --> 01:02:46.612
Pretty upset..
 huh.."Bat"

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:49.285
You better take another hit
 of that asteroid of yours.

01:02:55.914 --> 01:02:56.454
Laura!

01:02:57.373 --> 01:02:58.369
Give me a gun...

01:02:59.495 --> 01:03:00.767
Not that!..
The stun gun!..

01:03:05.253 --> 01:03:06.670
What's the primary?
- I don't know?

01:03:06.696 --> 01:03:07.640
We're gonna find it.

01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:09.662
I'm gonna screw that deal up..

01:03:09.788 --> 01:03:11.131
This is personal now,
 let's go.

01:03:43.594 --> 01:03:44.786
In the mood for a shot!

01:03:46.172 --> 01:03:47.420
I'm already in shock.

01:03:48.646 --> 01:03:50.159
Your crazy "Bat"

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.297
And don't you forget it.

01:03:53.234 --> 01:03:54.063
You know Laurie.

01:03:54.189 --> 01:03:55.959
You're just another notch
on his jock strap.

01:03:56.128 --> 01:03:57.814
You're, just a
genital obsessive.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.293
Aren't we all!

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.566
Anyway, I..
own it all too you.

01:04:03.592 --> 01:04:04.741
You made all this possible.

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:06.828
Thank you, Laura.

01:04:07.952 --> 01:04:09.416
♪ Thank you very much!.. ♪

01:04:09.642 --> 01:04:12.304
♪ Thank you very much!.. ♪

Done what?..
what are you talking about?

01:04:18.356 --> 01:04:21.493
Last Christmas..
daddy's office party.

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.722
I got the whole of..
 "Rushmore" coverage list.

01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:28.481
'Bat" are you okay?
-I'm not okay!

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:33.306
If you can straightening my lungs,
 look into my heart..

01:04:33.532 --> 01:04:35.645
I'm chasing rabbits down
a stinking black hole!

01:05:51.075 --> 01:05:51.849
Laura..

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:59.269
-This is primary control,
 B.H.P.D. is sending out...

01:05:59.395 --> 01:06:01.404
Paramedic vehicles with injured police.

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:02.838
And E.P.A. personnel.

01:06:03.628 --> 01:06:05.552
-Clear are you're
roadblocks immediately!

01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:06.512
 I repeat..

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:09.518
Clear all you're roadblocks immediately,
 injured police. Out.

01:06:09.867 --> 01:06:11.355
-Alright open up,
 here they come.

01:06:12.281 --> 01:06:13.213
Let them through.

01:06:14.854 --> 01:06:15.809
-Alright people.

01:06:16.035 --> 01:06:18.258
You're clear all the way through!
you better hurry!

01:06:25.434 --> 01:06:27.264
Let's see if we can go
through this roadblock?

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:28.297
Where's the Rolls Royce?

01:06:28.623 --> 01:06:31.296
They just spotted the "Rolls"
in an alley of La Vida.

01:06:34.428 --> 01:06:35.546
This doesn't look good!

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:38.868
Go! Get out!

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:42.628
Keep down!

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:49.424
Go! Go!
 -I'm going!

01:06:52.335 --> 01:06:53.755
No!!!

01:07:10.403 --> 01:07:12.142
-I copy.
- D.O.D. what's you're location?

01:07:12.168 --> 01:07:13.367
 ..Move to Campbell drive.

01:07:16.977 --> 01:07:19.305
It's uhh..
Black with sweet'n low.

01:07:20.331 --> 01:07:21.802
Just like you like it.

01:07:26.966 --> 01:07:28.327
I'm sorry, that I..

01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:30.212
It's okay "Bat"..

01:07:31.138 --> 01:07:33.942
What's a 120,000 volts
between friends.

01:07:35.761 --> 01:07:38.016
Well, I always told
you, there was uhh..

01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:40.136
Electricity between us.

01:07:49.255 --> 01:07:49.907
Hi..

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:51.836
I'm Chief Healy_Beverly Hills P.D.

01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:53.353
 You're E.P.A. right?

01:07:53.379 --> 01:07:54.044
 Yes..

01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:55.632
So uhh..

01:07:56.058 --> 01:07:58.535
Listen I'm thinking maybe I should
get a couple of helicopters

01:07:58.561 --> 01:08:00.899
In here take a look at's what's
going on what do you think.

01:08:00.938 --> 01:08:03.591
Uhh..Nah..I don't think
it's very good idea.

01:08:03.817 --> 01:08:05.662
No you're right,
 you're right that's stupid!

01:08:05.788 --> 01:08:06.644
Yeah.. I mean..

01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:08.659
It could spread this cloud
and kill half the city.

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:10.461
Yeah..
-What are you guys doing now?

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:11.925
Uhh..
What do you think?

01:08:13.993 --> 01:08:15.690
Well ..Uhh..
 I supposed uhh..

01:08:15.716 --> 01:08:17.446
You're measuring the
number of cubic meters.

01:08:17.471 --> 01:08:19.676
Of gas being released into
the atmosphere, right?

01:08:19.702 --> 01:08:20.582
 Yes..yeah, sure..

01:08:20.783 --> 01:08:21.606
That's uhh..

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:23.901
Yeah,.. you..you,
have to do that.

01:08:24.024 --> 01:08:25.063
What else you're doing.

01:08:25.433 --> 01:08:27.134
Well..Uhh..basically..uhh..

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.581
We're doing..you know..

01:08:28.607 --> 01:08:30.805
The next step,
which..uhh..uhh..

01:08:31.032 --> 01:08:32.134
Right..right..

01:08:32.635 --> 01:08:35.520
Measuring a time-frame
for the anticipation of the..uhh..

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:38.098
Of the cloud into the atmosphere.
 - Yes!

01:08:38.932 --> 01:08:40.608
So, how long you
figure that will take?

01:08:40.934 --> 01:08:42.514
 Well..uhm..It..It..It

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.343
Would probably take the
usual..uhh..usual amount of time...

01:08:45.368 --> 01:08:46.496
Which..uhh..uhh..

01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:48.729
What's that about?
..uhh..24 hours?

01:08:48.755 --> 01:08:49.736
Yeah!..yeah!..yeah!

01:08:49.761 --> 01:08:51.568

about a day, yeah.

01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:53.149
Because I've got too give these people.

01:08:53.274 --> 01:08:54.354
Some answers you know.

01:08:54.455 --> 01:08:56.017
I just can't have
them wandering around here.

01:08:56.243 --> 01:08:57.531
Like a bunch of..
 Natives.

01:08:57.532 --> 01:08:59.116

Oh no, not again!!

01:10:00.415 --> 01:10:01.482

01:12:22.427 --> 01:12:23.072

01:16:41.841 --> 01:16:42.619

01:16:59.164 --> 01:17:01.257
That's it..

01:17:01.773 --> 01:17:04.054
That must be the
 primary target he was talking about.

01:17:08.027 --> 01:17:09.766

01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:33.759
I've been saving you

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:39.240
Looks like you finally gonna earn
 that nickname ..."Boomer"..

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.061
♪ Crime doesn't pay, boys! ♪

01:20:04.287 --> 01:20:06.045
But it sure beats working.

01:20:10.903 --> 01:20:11.594

01:20:33.353 --> 01:20:35.471
-Straight ahead..

01:20:36.419 --> 01:20:38.622

Alright guys, that will be fine..
 -lets go!!

01:21:14.408 --> 01:21:16.792
You can't sell it..
It will always be traceable.

01:21:17.018 --> 01:21:18.722
No matter how long
you're keep it buried.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.269
You sure as Hell,
 you can't look at it.

01:21:22.787 --> 01:21:24.180
You surprise me
 Laura..

01:21:24.704 --> 01:21:27.029
I thought you've would have
had it figured it out by now..

01:21:27.399 --> 01:21:28.466
Had what figured out?

01:21:28.974 --> 01:21:30.517
This..all this..

01:21:32.141 --> 01:21:34.017
Do you think I care about
 that piece of junk.

01:21:34.043 --> 01:21:34.778
It's..Uhh..

01:21:34.865 --> 01:21:36.783
The worms can eat it,
 for all I care..

01:21:37.743 --> 01:21:38.448
It's a..Uhh...

01:21:38.774 --> 01:21:40.488
..A Chess piece.

01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:43.350
Expendable...
It's all expendable.

01:21:45.573 --> 01:21:47.259
I even get to stick it too
 the government.

01:21:47.585 --> 01:21:48.630
As a tax deduction..

01:21:49.715 --> 01:21:50.823
I don't understand?

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:54.227
Who own's it Laura..
who own's the wall..

01:21:54.598 --> 01:21:55.365
You do..

01:21:56.296 --> 01:21:57.496
And who has too
pay me back..

01:21:58.422 --> 01:21:59.416
Now that's it gone..

01:22:01.332 --> 01:22:02.547
Insurance...

01:22:03.798 --> 01:22:05.673
"Rushmore"..
my fathers company..

01:22:06.699 --> 01:22:07.482
Now...

01:22:08.121 --> 01:22:10.789
What happens when..
"Rushmore" can safe a billion dollars..

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:13.789
In exchange for making me
 the chairman of the board..

01:22:14.615 --> 01:22:15.717
Think about it Laura..

01:22:15.944 --> 01:22:17.895
Chairman of a multi-billion
dollar corporation.

01:22:18.121 --> 01:22:19.942
That has it's fingers
in hundreds of others..

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.850
And even daddy is gonna benefit
 from my leadership.

01:22:23.976 --> 01:22:24.770
The board...

01:22:24.914 --> 01:22:26.336
Probably eventually
 canalys me..

01:22:28.775 --> 01:22:30.743
More,
likely wish you in Hell.

01:23:09.081 --> 01:23:11.020
You..
 Lame, Son of a Bitch.

01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:13.300
Say something..

01:23:23.681 --> 01:23:25.330

01:23:25.845 --> 01:23:27.204
I Hate football!!

01:23:37.248 --> 01:23:38.162
You know..

01:23:38.829 --> 01:23:39.768

01:23:40.494 --> 01:23:41.603
Hate guys..

01:23:42.429 --> 01:23:44.011
That don't

01:23:50.171 --> 01:23:51.264
You're alright..

01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:52.411
I felt better.

01:23:58.634 --> 01:23:59.523
You're okay?

01:23:59.776 --> 01:24:00.572
Yeah..

01:24:00.737 --> 01:24:03.199
This bullet proof vest
wasn't such a bad idea after all.

01:24:09.785 --> 01:24:11.170
Let's
go find Laura!

01:24:13.902 --> 01:24:15.055

01:24:41.219 --> 01:24:42.325

01:24:42.951 --> 01:24:45.176
It's the only guarantee
 I have too keep you Quiet..

01:24:45.444 --> 01:24:46.831
The only
 attractive guarantee..

01:24:48.357 --> 01:24:50.106
As a wife..
can't be forced to..

01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:52.287
..Testify
 against her husband..

01:24:52.419 --> 01:24:55.061
What about all the other witnesses,
 you're gonna mary them too..

01:24:55.987 --> 01:24:57.878
Oh..the only other witnesses
 are accomplices..

01:24:58.110 --> 01:24:59.699
And extremely well paid accomplices..

01:25:00.187 --> 01:25:01.382
So, that leaves just you..

01:25:01.698 --> 01:25:03.305
Let me get this straight..

01:25:03.421 --> 01:25:05.488
It's my wedding or my funeral..
Is that it.

01:25:06.004 --> 01:25:06.993
Let's face it
Laura..

01:25:08.254 --> 01:25:09.630
You have no other
options..

01:25:13.116 --> 01:25:15.666
Just..Uhh..out of..
Curiosity.. "Bat"

01:25:16.619 --> 01:25:17.819

01:25:39.857 --> 01:25:40.914
Crossbow..

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:45.530
An arrow straight through
 the heart.

01:25:49.167 --> 01:25:50.940
Well then you better

01:27:36.643 --> 01:27:38.363

You know,

01:28:04.246 --> 01:28:06.088
Whatever you did,

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:06.824
You're forgiven.

01:28:07.072 --> 01:28:08.128
Who are you..God.

01:28:09.044 --> 01:28:11.172
If it wasn't for you..
I would have met him tonight.

01:28:11.446 --> 01:28:12.188

01:28:34.553 --> 01:28:35.155
-Yes sir..

01:28:35.937 --> 01:28:37.244
I'm sick of looking at him.
