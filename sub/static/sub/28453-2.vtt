WEBVTT

00:10.355 --> 00:12.322
Simon didn't kill Julia Stevens.

00:12.391 --> 00:13.979
Did you know your husband

00:14.048 --> 00:15.291
has a conviction
for aggravated assault?

00:16.982 --> 00:18.432
I've really fucked up, Ford.

00:19.881 --> 00:21.021
Just tell me what's happening.
Maybe I can help you.

00:21.228 --> 00:22.367
I got what you wanted.

00:28.890 --> 00:30.720
[Simon] I'd had a hard day.
Ford came in,

00:30.789 --> 00:31.824
suggested we go for a run.

00:31.893 --> 00:34.482
He gets wound up
if he doesn't exercise,

00:34.551 --> 00:36.760
I mean like he...
really needs it.

00:36.967 --> 00:38.452
[Simon] Home just before 11.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.075
[Bennett] If he's lying,
he's good at it.

00:42.559 --> 00:43.457
He's lying.

00:47.495 --> 00:49.359
[heavy breathing]

00:54.571 --> 00:55.572
[Ford] Simon!

00:57.712 --> 00:58.782
[Ford] Simon!

01:05.306 --> 01:06.583
-[Ford] Simon!
-[tires squealing]

[horn honking]

01:15.765 --> 01:17.732
[heavy breathing]

01:19.009 --> 01:20.459
[Ford]
You need to be more careful.

[theme music playing]

02:06.298 --> 02:07.437
[indistinct chatter]

02:11.717 --> 02:13.340
You've been questioned
three times.

02:13.409 --> 02:14.375
I know.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.378
A QC can make the police
leave you alone.

02:17.447 --> 02:19.449
No, a lawyer's only gonna make
me look guilty.

02:19.518 --> 02:20.381
[door clicks]

02:25.628 --> 02:28.458
Look, I can handle it.
[smooches] Promise.

02:31.668 --> 02:32.704
Good luck, Bear.

02:32.773 --> 02:34.257
You'll regret missing it
when we win.

02:34.809 --> 02:35.776
[Elke] Bye, Uncle Ford!

02:36.846 --> 02:38.296
-[engine starts]
-[car doors close]

02:44.681 --> 02:45.958
[Ford]
You sure you can handle it?

02:47.719 --> 02:49.376
Cops seem pretty...

02:50.584 --> 02:51.792
determined.

02:52.689 --> 02:53.725
I haven't done anything wrong.

02:54.346 --> 02:55.692
Apart from lie
about where you were.

02:56.900 --> 02:57.901
We both lied.

02:59.455 --> 03:00.663
Well, it was that or tell them
about your crazy girlfriend.

03:01.905 --> 03:03.528
She is not crazy.
And I told you she's--

03:03.597 --> 03:04.943
Yeah, she's a patient, I know.

03:05.530 --> 03:06.738
I know the party line.

03:07.877 --> 03:09.430
So, are you really
gonna go to work?

03:10.742 --> 03:11.984
You're not my keeper, Ford.

03:12.053 --> 03:13.400
No, no, quite the opposite.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.748
I should be looking after you.

03:18.681 --> 03:19.889
That's how it used to be.

03:24.031 --> 03:25.274
[phone chimes]

03:26.447 --> 03:28.035
-[sighs]
-[phone chimes]

03:30.002 --> 03:31.832
You think you can
just pick me up and put me down

03:31.901 --> 03:33.109
whenever you fucking feel
like it?

03:33.178 --> 03:35.318
You cannot come here.

03:52.646 --> 03:53.854
[dogs barking]

04:06.176 --> 04:07.488
Showed up at my home?

04:07.557 --> 04:08.662
You were being a prick.

04:12.113 --> 04:13.667
That's how you choose to deal
with it?

04:17.153 --> 04:18.258
[inhales]

04:20.605 --> 04:22.262
You were being a prick.

04:23.573 --> 04:24.712
[sighs]

04:26.680 --> 04:28.613
[chuckles]
What are you doing to me?

[dramatic music playing]

04:45.837 --> 04:46.838
[smooches]

04:56.123 --> 04:57.642
That was Elke, right?

04:57.711 --> 04:58.953
At the house?

05:00.610 --> 05:01.473
She's beautiful.

05:01.542 --> 05:02.957
You can't ever do that again.

05:03.855 --> 05:04.925
Or what?

05:10.551 --> 05:12.588
Are you still taking
the Amitriptyline?

05:13.520 --> 05:14.521
It didn't work.

05:15.729 --> 05:17.351
I told you,
you have to stick with it.

05:17.834 --> 05:19.664
Mereana,
you deserve to be happy.

05:19.905 --> 05:21.804
And what would you know
about being happy?

05:25.083 --> 05:26.567
You know what?

05:27.948 --> 05:29.432
I can't keep doing this.

05:30.778 --> 05:31.641
You say that now,

05:32.849 --> 05:33.333
after you've come round here
and fucked me.

05:36.232 --> 05:38.027
Get out, you arrogant arsehole.

05:40.063 --> 05:42.031
Go on. Fuck off!

-[Karen] Roza?
-Hi.

07:06.046 --> 07:08.255
Hi, I didn't know Izzy played.

07:08.324 --> 07:10.153
Oh, she's off with her friend,
somewhere.

07:10.395 --> 07:12.604
Yeah, I saw you. I thought
I should come say hello.

07:13.018 --> 07:14.088
You must be Elke.

07:15.158 --> 07:16.505
Hun, this is Roza.

07:16.574 --> 07:17.954
[sighs] You don't play?

07:19.611 --> 07:21.061
You're more into art,
aren't you, love?

07:22.062 --> 07:23.581
Claire's our sports star.

07:25.306 --> 07:26.894
Well,
do you want to come sit down?

07:27.101 --> 07:28.033
-Sure.
-[Karen] Okay.

07:28.102 --> 07:29.103
Yeah.

07:33.694 --> 07:35.178
[suspenseful music playing]

[sobs, sighs]

08:05.623 --> 08:06.589
Hi, I'm Roza.

08:06.796 --> 08:07.797
[group] Hi Roza.

08:08.764 --> 08:11.007
[Roza]
Uh, 18 months clean, this time.

08:11.318 --> 08:13.389
[group applauds]
Well done. Congratulations.

08:13.458 --> 08:14.597
[Roza] Thank you.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.808
Uh, I thought
it was gonna get easier...

08:20.051 --> 08:22.743
but right now,
I'm under so much pressure.

08:23.261 --> 08:24.607
My husband is--

08:25.435 --> 08:27.161
anyway, that's beside the point.

08:29.060 --> 08:33.858
I um, made a mistake, years ago,
before I knew him

08:34.997 --> 08:36.723
-and just lately--
-[shoe squeaks]

08:41.693 --> 08:44.144
-[man] You all right?
-[woman] What's the matter?

08:46.664 --> 08:47.734
[woman 2] Is she okay?

08:50.737 --> 08:52.739
You had me followed
to an AA meeting?

08:53.740 --> 08:55.535
Yeah, I thought
you fucking trusted me!

08:59.746 --> 09:00.850
[birds chirping]

09:05.027 --> 09:08.202
[David] Look, I'm so proud
of you, you know I am.

09:08.686 --> 09:10.929
But one relapse and there goes
everything we've worked--

09:10.998 --> 09:11.896
[weights thud]

09:13.449 --> 09:14.623
For God's sake, Roza.

09:20.249 --> 09:21.871
Okay! No more spies.

09:24.115 --> 09:27.152
Just... tell me what you want
me to do and I'll do it.

09:28.153 --> 09:30.224
-[thuds]
-[sighs]

09:30.984 --> 09:32.399
[sighs] I've invited
the Lamptons over

09:32.468 --> 09:33.745
for dinner tomorrow night.

09:34.332 --> 09:36.679
The doctor
and the excitable wife?

09:36.990 --> 09:38.129
And their two girls.

09:38.198 --> 09:39.993
Tomorrow night's
my only night in Auckland.

09:40.062 --> 09:41.615
I've got a meeting
with the Head of--

09:44.963 --> 09:47.172
Right. I'll cancel.

09:48.035 --> 09:49.381
The Lamptons it is.

10:06.433 --> 10:07.710
What can you tell me?

10:09.574 --> 10:11.921
He was head
of obstetrics at public,

10:12.301 --> 10:13.716
but went back
to his own practice

10:13.785 --> 10:14.890
a couple of years later.

10:15.891 --> 10:17.271
He's held in high regard,

10:17.478 --> 10:18.963
one of the best in the country.

10:21.206 --> 10:22.276
And then there's this.

10:23.036 --> 10:24.969
He beat up a girl
when he was a teenager.

10:27.316 --> 10:29.145
Why is Roza so interested?

10:29.559 --> 10:31.009
I'm not sure, but...

10:31.596 --> 10:32.908
Spit it out, Ed.

10:34.461 --> 10:37.775
Look, I know you don't wanna
have her followed, but this...

10:38.568 --> 10:39.708
fascination?

10:40.087 --> 10:41.192
It's a worry.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.161
All right.

10:46.404 --> 10:48.958
But you can't let Roza
catch you again.

10:50.339 --> 10:51.651
[dramatic music playing]

10:59.900 --> 11:01.971

[door clicks]

11:12.430 --> 11:13.327
[door closes]

11:14.466 --> 11:16.020
What time do you call this,
Sonny?

11:17.815 --> 11:18.816
What're you doing?

11:19.437 --> 11:20.783
Waiting up for you.

11:21.370 --> 11:22.440
Where've you been?

11:25.270 --> 11:28.308
-Working late.
-Hey, relax. Everyone's asleep.

11:38.525 --> 11:39.906
I think I'm losing it.

11:41.079 --> 11:42.529
Why? What's happened?

11:45.635 --> 11:47.499
[Simon] You were right.
I went to see Mereana.

11:47.568 --> 11:48.431
Ah!

11:48.673 --> 11:50.295
I broke it off, but...

11:51.641 --> 11:53.229
I can't stop
thinking about her.

11:54.058 --> 11:55.369
Hey, look around you, man.

11:56.198 --> 11:57.751
You're the guy that's got
everything.

11:58.131 --> 11:59.511
Why do you keep fucking this up?

11:59.719 --> 12:00.961
Because I want her, too.

12:02.445 --> 12:04.206
Oh, okay, we'll just call
the mid-life crisis police then.

12:04.275 --> 12:06.035
Why can't you be happy
with what you've got?

12:06.104 --> 12:07.036
I don't know.

12:10.315 --> 12:11.627
I feel more like myself
with her--

12:11.696 --> 12:14.009
Yourself? Oh, your fucking self?

12:14.250 --> 12:15.527
What about Karen? And your kids?

12:15.596 --> 12:16.494
I know. I know.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.048
I don't want
to fucking hurt them. Jesus.

12:19.117 --> 12:20.360
Then stop acting like a man
that doesn't give a shit

12:20.429 --> 12:22.224
-about anyone but himself!
-That is bullshit!

12:27.470 --> 12:29.438
Hey, I'm sorry, bro.
I'm just being a wanker.

12:30.646 --> 12:32.337
I'm not trying
to stir things up.

12:32.406 --> 12:33.925
I'm just worried about you.

12:35.962 --> 12:38.240
No, you're right.

12:40.932 --> 12:42.416
What the hell
is the matter with me?

12:46.593 --> 12:48.319
[birds chirping]

12:52.564 --> 12:53.807
-Hi.
-[Paula] Hello.

12:55.050 --> 12:57.362
Uh, is Doctor Lampton in,
by any chance?

12:57.431 --> 12:58.985
Uh, No, he's not, sorry.

12:59.675 --> 13:01.332
Is there somewhere private
we could talk?

13:04.335 --> 13:05.198
Sure.

13:08.235 --> 13:09.858
Were you working here
when Dr Lampton

13:09.927 --> 13:11.480
was treating Julia Stevens?

13:12.101 --> 13:14.069
Shouldn't you be asking
Dr Lampton about that?

13:14.138 --> 13:15.173
I have.

13:15.380 --> 13:16.485
Now I'm asking you.

13:18.142 --> 13:19.212
Yes, I was.

13:20.627 --> 13:21.455
[Da Silva] Did you know
she had a problem with Simon?

13:21.524 --> 13:22.905
The whole of Newmarket knew.

13:23.147 --> 13:25.356
She was very... upset

13:25.425 --> 13:26.529
on a couple of occasions.

13:27.634 --> 13:30.637
Did you ever see her
threaten him in any way?

13:31.707 --> 13:33.916
-[Paula] No.
-Did Simon ever threaten her?

13:34.123 --> 13:35.159
No.

13:35.228 --> 13:36.608
Has Simon ever threatened you?

13:36.677 --> 13:37.817
No!

13:39.163 --> 13:40.474
Was Simon having an affair
with Julia Stevens?

13:40.543 --> 13:42.373
[Paula] Oh, my God, how can yo--
Simon is not like that.

13:42.442 --> 13:43.961
Especially not with her.

13:44.030 --> 13:45.169
What's that supposed to mean?

13:48.103 --> 13:50.277
You're not helping him
by keeping things from us.

13:58.147 --> 14:00.287
She bumped into him
when he was in Queenstown,

14:00.356 --> 14:02.289
at a conference, and the trouble
started after that.

14:03.221 --> 14:04.395
What happened in Queenstown?

14:04.464 --> 14:06.052
Well, she followed him
to his hotel room,

14:06.121 --> 14:07.018
that's what happened.

14:08.433 --> 14:10.608
He sent her packing
and she started harassing him.

14:11.126 --> 14:14.370
In here, making a huge fuss.
It was disgraceful behavior.

14:15.268 --> 14:17.028
But Simon never lost his cool?

14:17.097 --> 14:18.064
[Paula] No!

14:18.271 --> 14:19.651
He asked her to leave.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.688
She was upsetting
the other patients.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.347
Apart from her,
they all adore him.

14:27.625 --> 14:28.660
What?

14:28.729 --> 14:30.352
I'd be more than willing
to discount him,

14:30.697 --> 14:32.457
but don't you think
he might have mentioned

14:32.526 --> 14:33.665
that business in Queenstown?

14:35.046 --> 14:36.599
[dramatic music playing]

14:47.196 --> 14:48.473
[Simon]
That's what you told them?

14:49.681 --> 14:52.063
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

14:53.789 --> 14:55.411
I just didn't know
what else to do.

14:56.033 --> 14:58.380
Oh, look it's not you, it's...
Never mind.

14:58.621 --> 15:01.072
-Let's just get on with the day.
-Okay.

15:08.390 --> 15:09.391

15:24.682 --> 15:26.304
[Karen] The whole lot
was completely covered

15:26.373 --> 15:27.685
in fairy lights. It was amazing,

15:27.754 --> 15:29.031
And on the driveway.

15:30.412 --> 15:32.103
And they had a valet,
they had a valet, Claire.

15:32.172 --> 15:33.656

35:56.119 --> 35:57.914
-That's Mereana's house.
-[Nelf] Yeah.

35:57.983 --> 36:00.399
Hey, Nelf, let's go check
that out first, yeah?

36:08.511 --> 36:10.237
[breathes deeply]

36:42.890 --> 36:44.857
[Da Silva] I know this must be
hard for you.

36:44.926 --> 36:47.515
Mereana was your neighbor
but she was also your friend?

36:47.998 --> 36:49.345
She was nice to you.

36:50.587 --> 36:52.624
You saw her in here, with a man,
and a knife.

36:53.038 --> 36:54.971
Four-Two-Five, Four-Two-Five.

36:55.420 --> 36:57.007
Did you get a good look
at the man?

36:58.043 --> 36:59.286
Not the same one.

36:59.872 --> 37:00.977
Not the same one--

37:02.323 --> 37:03.600
I don't fuckin' know. I--
I'm not allowed in here.

37:03.669 --> 37:04.774
I mean I went there.

37:05.706 --> 37:07.397
Do you think Mereana knew
her attacker?

37:11.159 --> 37:13.576
Okay, Nelf, thank you.

37:13.645 --> 37:15.509
You did the right thing,
coming to the police.

37:19.202 --> 37:20.686
[music playing]

37:23.137 --> 37:24.828
So, have I got this right,

37:25.139 --> 37:27.141
you went to school
with Roza Hallwright?

37:27.210 --> 37:28.280
Mm-hmm.

37:28.522 --> 37:30.040
And are you still mates?

37:30.731 --> 37:32.319
Yeah, when she feels like it.

37:32.595 --> 37:34.976
Ooh, that sounds complicated.

37:35.770 --> 37:37.047
What's the real story?

37:38.186 --> 37:39.602
[chuckles]

37:41.638 --> 37:43.744
You think I'd sell her out
for a couple of cocktails?

37:48.576 --> 37:49.750
[sighs]

37:52.615 --> 37:53.926
[music playing]

38:20.850 --> 38:22.507
[Da Silva] You mentioned
in your statement

38:22.576 --> 38:24.094
that Mereana had a boyfriend?

38:24.163 --> 38:26.752
Not a boyfriend, exactly.
He was married.

38:26.994 --> 38:28.409
What do you know about him?

38:28.754 --> 38:30.480
All she ever said
was that he was rich,

38:30.549 --> 38:33.621
but never happy.
That made us laugh. [chuckles]

38:34.173 --> 38:38.005
So, she was never scared,
or worried, or anything?

38:39.938 --> 38:42.009
Mereana was sad
because of her daughter.

38:42.458 --> 38:43.735
But trying to be positive.

38:44.011 --> 38:45.564
She wouldn't even take
heavy pills.

38:45.633 --> 38:47.497
Even though I bloody would've.
[chuckles]

38:48.187 --> 38:49.706
She suffered from depression?

38:49.775 --> 38:51.501
[Alia] She didn't see a shrink
or anything.

38:51.881 --> 38:53.469
She got the pills
through her boyfriend.

38:54.573 --> 38:55.712
The pills?

38:55.781 --> 38:56.920
The prescription.

39:02.685 --> 39:04.134
-[Karen] Oh, hi.
-[Simon] Hey.

39:04.618 --> 39:06.689
-Tough day at work?
-[Simon] Uh-huh.

39:08.691 --> 39:09.795
So, what do you think?

39:10.486 --> 39:12.073
It's great. I love it.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.489
Simon!

39:16.250 --> 39:17.527
I didn't buy those.

39:17.596 --> 39:19.598
Roza did. For Elke's birthday.

39:20.599 --> 39:21.497
Cute, huh?

39:21.566 --> 39:22.808
Are you kidding me?

39:22.877 --> 39:24.603
Roza? No, Karen!

39:24.672 --> 39:26.812
No, that's what I said, too,
but she insisted.

39:27.019 --> 39:28.366
There's one for Claire, too.

39:29.263 --> 39:31.127
-What are we, a charity?
-What?

39:31.196 --> 39:32.335
Give me those.

39:32.404 --> 39:34.061
What-- What are you gonna do
with them?

39:34.820 --> 39:35.683
Simon!

39:48.040 --> 39:49.525
[intercom ringing]

39:52.838 --> 39:54.909
Hallwright residence,
Janet McDonald speaking.

39:55.531 --> 39:57.429
Simon Lampton.
Is Mrs. Hallwright in?

39:57.740 --> 39:59.051
[Janet] What's this about?

39:59.120 --> 40:00.398
[Simon] Simon Lampton.
I was here with my family

40:00.467 --> 40:03.055
-the other night for dinner.
-[camera clicking]

40:04.367 --> 40:05.886
[gate opens]

40:17.725 --> 40:19.900
Well, this is a nice surprise,
but David's in Wellington.

40:21.349 --> 40:22.903
This was a very generous gift

40:22.972 --> 40:24.525
but obviously,
we can't accept it.

40:24.594 --> 40:25.733
Elke didn't like it?

40:27.010 --> 40:28.633
She doesn't know about it.

40:29.081 --> 40:30.566
What is really going on here?

40:31.256 --> 40:32.533
What do you mean?

40:33.707 --> 40:35.433
[Simon] The party,
the dinner, this.

40:35.985 --> 40:37.262
What do you want from us?

40:40.852 --> 40:42.163
-I'm so sorry.
-[Simon] Why?

40:42.992 --> 40:43.958
What's wrong?

40:46.616 --> 40:48.066
Roza?
What the hell is going on?

40:48.653 --> 40:49.895
Did she have a party?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.035
Who?

40:52.104 --> 40:53.002
Elke.

40:53.071 --> 40:54.279
What has she got
to do with this?

40:54.348 --> 40:56.005
[chuckles]

40:56.695 --> 40:57.869
Are you on something?

40:57.938 --> 40:59.871
What I'm on
is the least of my problems.

41:01.666 --> 41:04.047
-If you need help--
-You adopted her, right?

41:04.116 --> 41:05.463
When you lived in Australia?

41:06.118 --> 41:06.981
Yes.

41:07.775 --> 41:08.949
And?

41:09.018 --> 41:11.020
And you got to watch her
get her first teeth

41:11.089 --> 41:13.747
and learn to walk

41:14.782 --> 41:16.715
and go off to school. [sobbing]

41:17.060 --> 41:20.478
And now she's 13
and she's beautiful.

41:21.893 --> 41:23.239
You're talking about Elke?

41:24.758 --> 41:26.035
My Elke?

41:28.658 --> 41:30.764
She's not just your Elke, Simon.

41:32.973 --> 41:34.630
She's my Elke, too.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.846
It was a closed adoption.

41:47.194 --> 41:48.540
I was...

41:49.334 --> 41:51.198
an out-of-control 19-year-old.

41:51.716 --> 41:52.717
[Simon] This is...

41:53.959 --> 41:55.064
But I've changed,
everything's changed.

41:55.478 --> 41:56.721
What does David say?

41:57.998 --> 41:59.102
David doesn't know.

41:59.931 --> 42:01.001
You need to tell him.

42:01.070 --> 42:02.140
-Yeah, I will.
-When?

42:05.005 --> 42:07.317
Jesus, Roza. This is gonna
devastate Karen.

42:10.355 --> 42:12.426
-I don't want to hurt anyone.
-What do you want?

42:12.495 --> 42:14.359
To be a part of her life.

42:14.428 --> 42:15.705
Oh, really?

42:15.774 --> 42:16.810
After we protected her,

42:18.190 --> 42:19.329
loved her all these years.
Have you even stopped

42:19.398 --> 42:20.710
to consider how this will
affect her?

42:20.779 --> 42:22.298
Simon, she's my daughter!
I want her in my life.

42:22.367 --> 42:23.679
You gave her away!

42:23.748 --> 42:24.852
She's my blood.

42:33.481 --> 42:36.381
[door opens, closes]

42:41.179 --> 42:42.939
[indistinct chatter]

42:49.394 --> 42:50.395
[camera clicks]

43:04.858 --> 43:07.792
Guess who's prescribing her
anti-depressants.

43:09.034 --> 43:10.415
Your bloody doctor.

43:10.967 --> 43:12.348
My bloody doctor.

43:21.150 --> 43:23.152
[Claire] Hey! You always get
the comfy chair.

43:23.221 --> 43:25.154
-[Elke] Do not!
-[Karen] Girls, stop arguing.

43:25.223 --> 43:28.157
[Ford] Hey, girls. Girls! Hey,
c'mon, on the couch with me.

43:28.502 --> 43:31.056
-[Karen] How did it go?
-What?

43:31.574 --> 43:33.231
Roza. The bags.

43:34.163 --> 43:36.337
Oh, she-- she apologized.

43:36.406 --> 43:38.270
She didn't mean
to offend anyone.

43:38.339 --> 43:41.619
Oh God, oh,
it's so embarrassing!

43:41.860 --> 43:44.691
No, it's no big deal.
She was fine.

43:45.105 --> 43:46.209
Really.

43:48.764 --> 43:50.697
You're a good mother,
you know that?

43:53.320 --> 43:54.424
Really?

43:55.805 --> 43:57.082
We're lucky to have you.

43:57.876 --> 43:58.912
All of us.

44:03.019 --> 44:04.400
Karen, I need to tell you--

44:04.469 --> 44:06.229
Dude, I could've sold those bags
for you.

44:06.920 --> 44:08.093
Got back some money

44:08.162 --> 44:09.681
that the Hallwrights
fleeced you out of.

44:10.371 --> 44:11.925
It's both bins tonight.

44:13.892 --> 44:14.928
[Ford] I'll get it.

44:14.997 --> 44:16.136
You look knackered, mate.

44:18.932 --> 44:20.727
Dad, come watch this.

44:22.556 --> 44:24.006
[dramatic music playing]

44:38.883 --> 44:41.333
[theme music playing]
