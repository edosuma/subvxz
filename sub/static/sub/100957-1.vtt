01:41.320 --> 01:42.320
I can't sleep.

01:45.247 --> 01:46.780
- Come on
- No you go.

01:47.503 --> 01:48.870
No you go.

01:49.222 --> 01:50.622
Do I have to?

01:50.902 --> 01:52.435
Paper, scissors, stone.

01:53.362 --> 01:55.745
1, 2, 3.

01:55.980 --> 01:56.980
Ah!

01:57.005 --> 01:57.620
Off you go.

01:57.645 --> 01:59.445
God.

02:01.526 --> 02:02.526
Dad?

02:03.323 --> 02:04.495
- Eh?
- What's the matter?

02:05.472 --> 02:07.073
Where is Liz?

02:07.307 --> 02:08.640
Shh, stop calm down.

02:08.909 --> 02:10.909
Dad, mum is not here
anymore.

02:11.735 --> 02:12.985
Oh, she was here.

02:13.415 --> 02:14.415
No mum...

02:15.250 --> 02:18.024
Mum is not here anymore dad.
She's gone.

02:19.626 --> 02:21.578
When I went to sleep
she was just there.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.147
OK, OK, she's just
in the bathroom.

02:24.977 --> 02:27.111
She'll be back
in five minutes. Lay down.

02:28.001 --> 02:29.001
You sure?

02:29.235 --> 02:30.235
Settle down OK?

02:30.798 --> 02:31.931
Go back to sleep.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.703
Shh. It's OK.

02:50.966 --> 02:52.726
Oh come on.

02:55.861 --> 02:56.861
Oh god.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.156
- Sit tight.
- Sean!

02:59.320 --> 03:01.202
- No.
- Go on.

03:01.227 --> 03:02.555
- Not interested.
- Please.

03:02.580 --> 03:03.580
Not my problem.

03:03.727 --> 03:05.127
Sean I've gone twice.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.152
Don't care!

03:06.641 --> 03:09.258
Oh please just go.

03:13.947 --> 03:16.407

03:16.525 --> 03:17.813
Oh what's wrong Robert?

03:17.970 --> 03:18.970
My keys!

03:19.064 --> 03:20.664
Where did I put my keys.

03:20.689 --> 03:22.384
There in the same
place they usually are.

03:23.283 --> 03:25.683
Look have a look on
the door here. Can you see it?

03:25.938 --> 03:27.540
- No.
- Well have a look.

03:27.697 --> 03:30.079
It's the same place.
Can you see it? OK?

OK.

That was Jackie on the phone now.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.431
Robert's gone missing.

05:20.433 --> 05:22.228
Oh God, not again.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.045
He's up on the cliff, she mentioned.

Oh, Spud Murphy.

Yeah, my pal.

07:35.961 --> 07:37.237
And who?

07:37.239 --> 07:39.262
Well, that's you, Dad.

07:39.264 --> 07:40.591
Who?

07:40.593 --> 07:42.426
- That's you.
- No, no.

07:43.270 --> 07:46.253
You know, when you retired,
when you moved to Tenerife,

07:47.500 --> 07:49.050
you joined the Mountain Rescue.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.816

10:16.570 --> 10:18.208
Hey, sorry I'm late.

10:18.210 --> 10:19.788
I was on the phone to my mum in the UK.

10:19.790 --> 10:21.038
She's not feeling very well.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.048
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that, Rosie.

10:24.050 --> 10:26.128
I've gotta dash, I'm sorry.

10:26.130 --> 10:28.578
I'm opening the shop this morning.

Of course, no worries.

10:29.490 --> 10:30.338
Can you watch Dad?

10:30.340 --> 10:32.240
Yeah, of course I could, no problem.

10:34.420 --> 10:35.708
- Dad.
- Hmm?

10:35.710 --> 10:36.541
Bye.

10:36.543 --> 10:37.374
Bye, bye.

10:37.376 --> 10:38.402
See you, thanks.

10:38.404 --> 10:39.253
- No worries.
- See you.

10:39.255 --> 10:41.226
- Catch you later.
- Bye.

10:41.228 --> 10:44.548
All right, what are we
gonna do today, dominoes?

10:44.550 --> 10:45.383
Let's do it.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.782
Don't go beating me
again this time, though.

10:48.784 --> 10:50.015
I know what you're like.

10:50.017 --> 10:54.585
- Okay, okay.
- Yes.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.056
Don't go beating me this time, eh?

10:57.058 --> 11:01.245
Well, well, you've got to try.

11:06.047 --> 11:07.214
- Get on.
- Oh.

11:21.837 --> 11:24.670
You've still got
Sean, gorgeous husband.

11:26.841 --> 11:27.847
Doolally father.

11:27.849 --> 11:29.730
A doolally father.

11:29.732 --> 11:30.818
How is he.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.673
Yeah, ups and downs, smiles and frowns.

11:35.387 --> 11:36.883
Oh, Mike, Mike, look.

11:37.950 --> 11:39.138
I'm gonna be retiring soon,

11:39.140 --> 11:41.368
so you're gonna have to
make up your mind, my love.

11:41.370 --> 11:43.803
Now, who do you reckon?

11:44.682 --> 11:47.318
We've got two really good girls here.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.353
There's that Jackie,

11:49.684 --> 11:51.728
and there's that lovely Eva.

11:51.730 --> 11:52.638
Now, come on.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.838
At the end of the day, it's my decision,

11:54.840 --> 11:56.568
and we have got plenty of time.

11:56.570 --> 11:57.838
All right, love, just
make sure you do it.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.673
Don't worry.

12:18.224 --> 12:20.568
- Morning.
- Hiya, mate.

12:20.570 --> 12:21.886
How you getting on with Pedro's baby now?

12:21.888 --> 12:23.686
Yeah, not too bad.

12:23.688 --> 12:26.946
Things can be a bit fussy
now and then, like my wife.

12:26.948 --> 12:28.248
I'll tell her you said that.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.368
Yeah.

12:29.370 --> 12:32.448
Yeah, look, he's got a fleet
of these lovely old motors.

12:32.450 --> 12:33.648
Wedding cars and all sorts.

12:33.650 --> 12:34.867
Now, if I can tap into his business,

12:34.869 --> 12:36.971
we can make a lot of money out of it.

12:36.973 --> 12:40.110
When I told him I had a vintage
mechanic working for me,

12:40.112 --> 12:42.288
he couldn't wait to get his
cars over here, to be honest.

12:42.290 --> 12:43.123
Dangerous.

12:43.970 --> 12:46.568
No, mate, no, I'll have
this done, don't worry.

12:46.570 --> 12:48.008
Once I get this all lubed up,

12:48.010 --> 12:51.568
she'll be purring like someone's,

12:51.570 --> 12:53.320
well, let's not go there, shall we?

13:23.858 --> 13:26.441
Robert, Robert, are you okay?

13:27.460 --> 13:28.948
Hey, yes?

13:28.950 --> 13:30.950
Would you like a little bit of sandwich?

13:31.990 --> 13:33.277
- Huh?
- Yeah.

13:33.279 --> 13:34.110
Tea and a sandwich.

13:34.112 --> 13:35.753
You watch some TV while you're waiting?

13:37.030 --> 13:38.483
Okay, okay.

13:45.489 --> 13:49.182
Do you want some tomato
to go on your sandwich?

13:49.184 --> 13:50.017
Hmm?

13:55.630 --> 13:57.278
Ah, you normally like
tomato; I'll put some in.

13:57.280 --> 14:00.923
Tomato and cheese, does
that sound all right?

14:02.643 --> 14:06.188
Good afternoon, lunchtime
news with Sophie Beckinswaite.

14:06.190 --> 14:08.728
We have breaking news just in from London.

14:08.730 --> 14:11.098
There has been a coordinated
terrorist attack.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.648
The government have raised
security levels to amber,

14:13.650 --> 14:15.628
and all police leave has been cancelled

14:15.630 --> 14:18.868
to ensure the public's utmost safety.

14:18.870 --> 14:21.063
For live updates, please keep watching.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.553
Robert?

14:33.796 --> 14:34.629
Oh no!

15:04.755 --> 15:05.588
Hello?

15:07.876 --> 15:10.126
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all
right, Rosa, calm down.

15:12.427 --> 15:13.260
He's what?

15:14.560 --> 15:15.408
Oh shit.

15:15.410 --> 15:17.958
Look, look, look, stay with
him, don't go anywhere.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.518
Give me 10 minutes.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.485
Just calm down, all right?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.037
All right, see you in a minute.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.348
Oh shit.

15:25.350 --> 15:26.904
- What's happening now?
- Look, mate.

15:26.906 --> 15:28.658
Mate, now I've gotta go.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.521
What do you mean, you gotta go?

15:29.523 --> 15:31.198
Robert, he's had his turn again.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.595
You know what he's like.

15:32.597 --> 15:34.855
Mate, Sean, I need this
done, mate, I need it fixed.

15:34.857 --> 15:36.579
Literally the manifold, mate.

15:36.581 --> 15:39.498
That's all it is, that's all it is.

15:40.963 --> 15:43.213
Well, what is a manifold?

16:03.802 --> 16:05.219
Robert, Robert!

16:06.517 --> 16:08.269
Come on, no, leave it, leave it, no!

16:08.271 --> 16:09.354
Robert, stop!

16:12.577 --> 16:13.687
Robert, come on!

16:13.689 --> 16:14.522
Robert!

16:16.260 --> 16:18.180
Sorry, sorry, all right, come on.

16:18.182 --> 16:19.015
Sorry.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.357
Calm down, all right?

16:28.891 --> 16:30.444
Now, Rosie, I gotta get to work.

16:30.446 --> 16:32.635
Of course, yes.

16:32.637 --> 16:34.508
I just, I feel so bad.

16:34.510 --> 16:38.158
He was watching a terrorist
programme on TV, and...

16:38.160 --> 16:40.876
Yeah, he used to be a policeman.

16:40.878 --> 16:41.728
Thinks he's protecting us.

16:41.730 --> 16:43.898
And when I turned around, he was gone.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.168
That's not your fault.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.308
Look, if you'd care to
take him back to the house,

16:47.310 --> 16:49.497
I'll see if I can...

16:49.499 --> 16:50.585
Oh shit!

16:50.587 --> 16:53.311
Oh God, I'll phone Jackie.

17:30.470 --> 17:31.370
Okay, then, Rob?

17:34.860 --> 17:36.553
What are you doing out here, then?

17:37.880 --> 17:39.030
I'm going for a walk.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.869
Well, yeah, you can carry on going,

17:42.871 --> 17:44.841
walking up that way, but,

17:44.843 --> 17:47.495
tell you what, it's a bit of a trek.

17:47.497 --> 17:50.852
However, you carry on going down there,

17:50.854 --> 17:52.926
there's a really nice bar.

17:52.928 --> 17:55.428
You can have a nice cold beer.

17:59.087 --> 18:02.337
I'll take that as a yes, then, come on.

18:09.087 --> 18:09.920
All right.

18:19.795 --> 18:20.956
- Hey.
- Eva!

18:20.958 --> 18:21.886
Where the hell have you been?

18:21.888 --> 18:23.258
I was making a daisy chain.

18:23.260 --> 18:24.860
Well, Dad's not very well, he's had a...

18:24.862 --> 18:25.718
Oh!

18:25.720 --> 18:26.551
Look, I'm gonna have to go.

18:26.553 --> 18:27.690
I've been waiting for you for 20 minutes.

18:27.692 --> 18:28.588
- Is he all right?
- I don't know.

18:28.590 --> 18:29.909
I have to go, see you later.

18:29.911 --> 18:33.022
Oh, okay.

19:09.451 --> 19:10.931
Oh, God.

19:10.933 --> 19:13.100
Daddad, Dad, are you okay?

19:16.670 --> 19:18.546
What the hell is this?

19:18.548 --> 19:20.425
No, no, no, no, no!

19:20.427 --> 19:21.474
You bought him beer?

19:21.476 --> 19:22.307
Come on, Jackie.

19:22.309 --> 19:23.908
I thought we'd agreed, no alcohol.

19:23.910 --> 19:24.969
It makes him confused.

19:24.971 --> 19:26.138
Confused?

19:26.140 --> 19:27.798
He was out in the hills
combing for terrorists,

19:27.800 --> 19:29.718
stopping cars, even pushed Rosa.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.748
So, I followed him up in the hills, right,

19:32.750 --> 19:33.678
and we got hot and thirsty,

19:33.680 --> 19:36.542
so we came down to the
bar to have a few drinks.

19:36.544 --> 19:38.390
What, you want me to make him dehydrate?

19:38.392 --> 19:39.988
Dehydrated?

19:39.990 --> 19:41.418
- There's always water.
- We needed a drink!

19:41.420 --> 19:46.228
No, you needed the drink,
he needed to be at home, safe.

19:46.230 --> 19:47.896
Come on, Dad, put this down.

19:47.898 --> 19:49.887
- Come on, come on.
- No.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.890
Let's get you home.

21:06.130 --> 21:08.418
Don't forget your wages.

21:08.420 --> 21:09.253
Oh yeah.

21:10.944 --> 21:13.368
Ah, so, how's he been today?

21:13.370 --> 21:14.268
Yeah, he's been a bit better.

21:14.270 --> 21:15.101
It's been a good day today.

21:15.103 --> 21:19.293
Good, good, he had a few
off-and-on moments earlier.

21:21.549 --> 21:22.808
- There you go.
- Ah, thank you.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.538
It's because he trusts you, you see?

21:24.540 --> 21:26.128
Yes, he does.

21:26.130 --> 21:28.503
Unfortunately, I've got a bit of bad news.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.578
My mum's not well.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.028
She's got worse, unfortunately,

21:32.030 --> 21:35.038
so I'm gonna have to go back
to the UK and look after her.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.361
Oh my god, no!

21:36.363 --> 21:37.196
What?

21:38.993 --> 21:39.824
What's going on?

21:39.826 --> 21:42.010
Rosie's got to back to the UK.

21:42.012 --> 21:43.240
Oh.

21:43.242 --> 21:45.128
Her mum's not well, she
has to look after her.

21:45.130 --> 21:45.961
Well, you can't.

21:45.963 --> 21:47.648
What do mean she can't?

21:47.650 --> 21:50.028
Who's gonna clean this
place, Mary bloody Poppins?

21:50.030 --> 21:51.601
Who's gonna look after him?

21:51.603 --> 21:53.638
I don't know yet, Sean,
I've just found out.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.117
It's her mother we're
talking about here, Sean.

21:55.119 --> 21:56.418
No, I know,

21:56.420 --> 21:58.838
but we've gotta think about
we're doing around here.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.708
Look, we'll sort
something out, but for now,

22:00.710 --> 22:02.038
we just have to deal with the fact

22:02.040 --> 22:04.040
that we don't have Rosie for long, okay?

22:05.040 --> 22:06.143
Oh, great.

22:06.990 --> 22:10.698
Okay, well, I don't know who's
gonna be scrubbing after him,

22:10.700 --> 22:12.028
who's gonna be looking after me,

22:12.030 --> 22:13.245
who's gonna be looking after you.

22:13.247 --> 22:15.728
I don't need looking after.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.981
I'm so sorry, Rosie, I'm so sorry.

22:17.983 --> 22:19.132
It's okay.
He's a bit rude.

22:19.134 --> 22:19.965
Well, if you need me,

22:19.967 --> 22:23.842
I'll be scrubbing skidmarks
off the loo, all right?

22:23.844 --> 22:24.771
We're really gonna miss you.

22:24.773 --> 22:26.223
I know, I'll miss you, too.

22:49.226 --> 22:50.393
John.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.115
What are you doing back here?

22:52.117 --> 22:53.600
More to the point, what
were you doing in there?

22:53.602 --> 22:55.048
Ha ha ha ha, very funny, having a dump.

22:55.050 --> 22:56.037
What are you doing back here?

22:56.039 --> 22:57.704
No, no, I'm just
doing a bit of overtime.

22:57.706 --> 22:59.668
I thought I'd put a bit of work in.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.707
You are taking the piss.

23:00.709 --> 23:03.928
No, no, I can put the work in for ya.

23:03.930 --> 23:05.028
Well, about bloody time, mate.

23:05.030 --> 23:06.758
I'll go get the post sorted.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.143
You get this cracked by the morning, mate,

23:10.197 --> 23:11.168
I'll love you forever.

23:11.170 --> 23:12.113
No worries.

23:13.510 --> 23:15.207
Give my regards to your wife.

23:22.563 --> 23:23.480
Hello, you.

23:44.370 --> 23:45.428
Sean?

23:45.430 --> 23:46.528
Jackie.

23:46.530 --> 23:47.728
Where are you?

23:47.730 --> 23:48.561
I'm on this job, aren't I?

23:48.563 --> 23:51.335
What the hell do mean you're...

23:51.337 --> 23:52.715
No, you're supposed to be here!

23:52.717 --> 23:55.668
I'm meant to be going out with
Eva tonight, you know this.

23:55.670 --> 23:58.972
Yes, I know, but it's
important, I've got to do it.

23:58.974 --> 24:00.698
Brilliant.

24:00.700 --> 24:01.531
Yeah, that's great.

24:01.533 --> 24:03.318
So, I have to cancel my
plans because of you.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.179
Is that what's happening.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.455
Yeah, I, ah, Jackie.

24:06.457 --> 24:09.108
Ah, forget it, no, forget
it, I'll cancel my plans.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.638
- Jackie!
- No, I'll cancel my plans.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.304
Are you gonna let me,
you gonna let me talk?

24:13.306 --> 24:15.890
Sean, just stay at work, please.

24:20.509 --> 24:21.426
God's sake.

25:30.592 --> 25:32.968
Well, if you can't come
out, I'm coming to you.

25:32.970 --> 25:35.788
Happy hour!

25:35.790 --> 25:37.240
Oh, what is it, what's wrong?

25:38.300 --> 25:39.968
Come on, have a drink.

25:39.970 --> 25:41.470
We'll worry about it tomorrow.

25:53.225 --> 25:55.721
I don't know why you don't
just put him in a home.

25:55.723 --> 25:57.118
I can't do that, you know.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.728
Well, he's not gonna know.

25:59.730 --> 26:00.730
It's Dad.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.821
Oh, hey, Bob, do you fancy some bubbles?

26:03.823 --> 26:04.654
No, no, no, no.

26:04.656 --> 26:07.065
I can't open the bathroom door.

26:07.067 --> 26:09.018
Sometimes the handle sticks.

26:09.020 --> 26:09.939
Give me two ticks.

26:09.941 --> 26:11.024
Yeah, okay.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.820
He wouldn't know.

26:21.822 --> 26:23.739
I'd know, I promised.

26:39.625 --> 26:41.792
Cheers!

26:44.868 --> 26:46.376
That's it.

26:46.378 --> 26:48.295
- Hits the spot.
- Yeah.

27:31.241 --> 27:33.072
The state of you.

27:33.074 --> 27:33.905
You've been up all night?

27:33.907 --> 27:35.079
Yeah.

27:35.081 --> 27:35.939
So, you finished it, then?

27:35.941 --> 27:38.308
Yeah, you know, there's
a bit left, but I'm not...

27:38.310 --> 27:41.328
The car, the car, have
you finished the car?

27:41.330 --> 27:42.865
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's, um, yes.

27:42.867 --> 27:47.007
Good lad, I'll give Pedro a
call, give him the good news.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.617
Oh, fuck.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.783
No, Sean, I need you to come home now.

27:59.532 --> 28:01.798
No, I've got to open the shop.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.848
Yes, but what am I meant to do?

28:03.850 --> 28:05.758
He's relying on me.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.278
- Eva can't open...
- what the fuck am I meant...

28:07.280 --> 28:08.898
Look, will you just please come home?

28:08.900 --> 28:10.078
I need you to look after Dad.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.880
Yeah, well, I've got fucking
responsibilities as well.

28:25.130 --> 28:25.963
Jackie.

28:27.954 --> 28:30.098
Well, it's me, where are you?

28:30.100 --> 28:32.248
Well, I have had to come
into shop and open up.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.958
Do you realise that?

28:33.960 --> 28:36.128
Yeah, I'm here now, yeah.

28:36.130 --> 28:38.398
Well, you weren't, where are you?

28:38.400 --> 28:41.318
Well, it is my day off,
and I was gonna go sailing.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.920
Yeah, who else, with Fred, yeah.

28:43.757 --> 28:46.038
Well, you just get in here straight away,

28:46.040 --> 28:49.161
'cause I'll tell you
something, I am not happy.

28:49.163 --> 28:50.643
Yeah, okay.

28:51.670 --> 28:53.322
All right, I'll see you in 20 minutes.

28:53.324 --> 28:55.354
Yeah, all right, that's good.

28:55.356 --> 28:56.585
Well, hurry up, then.

28:56.587 --> 28:57.420
God!

29:02.267 --> 29:04.333
Are we all set and ready to go?

29:06.615 --> 29:08.015
Oh, what have you got there?

29:11.042 --> 29:12.510
That's a good one, wow.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.678
Don't you be getting any ideas.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.434
I don't think you'll be
catching anything that big.

29:17.436 --> 29:18.445
We'll see, we'll see.

29:18.447 --> 29:20.637
Oh, oh, is that a challenge, eh?

29:27.542 --> 29:29.888
How are you feeling?

29:29.890 --> 29:31.113
- Rough.
- Yeah, same.

29:32.630 --> 29:34.488
I'll tell you what, I can
do with a bacon sandwich.

29:34.490 --> 29:35.688
Oh, look, we've got eggs to go with it.

30:01.487 --> 30:03.328
I'm really gonna miss this place.

30:03.330 --> 30:04.308
Bye-bye, sunshine.

30:04.310 --> 30:05.428
Just feel like I'm abandoning them

30:05.430 --> 30:06.838
just when they need me the most.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.028
I think it's probably
worse for Jackie and Sean.

30:09.030 --> 30:11.038
Old people are so interesting, you know?

30:11.040 --> 30:13.498
They've got so much to
tell, so many stories.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.093
To lose that, it's such
a shame, it's so sad.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.218
We have to do something fun.

30:19.220 --> 30:20.138
- Definitely.
- Yes.

30:20.140 --> 30:23.244
Good idea, give Jackie and
Sean a break as well, won't it?

30:23.246 --> 30:25.418
Oh, carnival!

30:25.420 --> 30:26.378
That's soon, isn't it?

30:26.380 --> 30:27.770
Yeah, next weekend.

33:44.687 --> 33:47.854
Before I go, I have something for you.

33:49.430 --> 33:50.528
Birthday card.

33:50.530 --> 33:53.743
But you can't open it
till your birthday, okay?

33:55.351 --> 33:56.418
Deal?

33:56.420 --> 33:59.588
- Thank you, thank you.
- Ah, you're welcome.

33:59.590 --> 34:00.423
Hug.

34:05.780 --> 34:06.613
You'll be okay.

34:09.473 --> 34:12.344
I don't belong here, Rosa.

34:12.346 --> 34:14.013
I don't belong here.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.370
Don't say that.

34:18.010 --> 34:19.988
I should be in the hills.

34:19.990 --> 34:22.330
That's where I belong, in the hills.

34:23.816 --> 34:25.248
They'll look after you.

34:25.250 --> 34:26.663
Honestly, it'll be okay.

34:29.950 --> 34:30.783
Oh.

34:34.267 --> 34:35.480
- Sean, bye.
- Yeah.

34:35.482 --> 34:37.326
- Bye.
- Bye, Sean.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.118
Dad.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.258
Look, here.

35:04.260 --> 35:07.010
You must've just moved to
Tenerife in these ones, look.

35:15.970 --> 35:17.378
Oh, look, this is Rusty.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.948
You remember Rusty.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.123
Yes, Rusty.

35:22.797 --> 35:24.714
Oh, look at you here!

35:26.395 --> 35:28.553
So stupid!

35:28.555 --> 35:30.155
And this one.

35:30.157 --> 35:32.508
- Oh, that's Liz.
- Yeah, that's right.

35:32.510 --> 35:33.371
That's Mum.

35:33.373 --> 35:35.225
Where is she?

35:35.227 --> 35:36.060
Dad.

35:37.368 --> 35:38.199
Where is she?

35:38.201 --> 35:40.017
Mum died, two years ago.

35:41.790 --> 35:42.623
Remember?

35:45.810 --> 35:46.893
I know that.

35:49.571 --> 35:50.404
I miss her.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.797
I know, we both miss her.

35:55.560 --> 35:56.393
Come on.

36:02.685 --> 36:04.643
Here on your wedding day, look, see?

36:04.645 --> 36:07.530
Oh, I know.

36:07.532 --> 36:08.365
No.

36:11.057 --> 36:11.890
Okay.

36:31.923 --> 36:34.833
Yeah, yeah, all right, mate, okay.

36:36.190 --> 36:38.563
Thanks, okay, you take
care, bye-bye, bye-bye.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.508
Sean, you got a minute, mate?

36:45.510 --> 36:46.343
Yeah.

36:47.190 --> 36:48.345
Yeah, have a seat.

36:48.347 --> 36:49.507
Yeah, all right?

36:49.509 --> 36:51.509
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.

36:52.390 --> 36:54.104
That was Pedro on the phone.

36:54.106 --> 36:55.187
Oh, how is he, all right?

36:55.189 --> 36:56.399
Yeah, he's all right, as it goes, yeah.

36:56.401 --> 36:57.681
Oh, good.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.453
But his car isn't, mate.

37:00.715 --> 37:03.868
Eh, what did you forget to do?

37:03.870 --> 37:05.431
You forgot to bleed the
cooling system, Sean,

37:05.433 --> 37:07.048
is what you forgot to do.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.518
How basic is that?

37:08.520 --> 37:10.488
Even I know about that.

37:10.490 --> 37:12.078
So, now his car's all seized up,

37:12.080 --> 37:14.648
and he's taking his business elsewhere.

37:14.650 --> 37:16.550
You made me look like a right pillock.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.468
Sorry.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.168
Yeah, well, you will be, Sean.

37:20.170 --> 37:21.948
I'm letting you go.

37:21.950 --> 37:23.351
I've gotta let you go,
mate, I've had enough.

37:23.353 --> 37:26.408
I can't cope with your
moods and your drinking.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.788
It's just too much, all right, so get out.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.698
- Oh, come on.
- Leave, go.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.858
You give me the right
hump, Sean, just get out.

37:32.860 --> 37:34.378
I'll sort your money out,
and I'll send on to you.

37:34.380 --> 37:35.503
You gotta go, go!

37:36.730 --> 37:38.230
Leave your jacket on the side.

37:39.070 --> 37:39.901
Well, I'm sorry, man.

37:39.903 --> 37:41.653
Yeah, so am I, just go.

38:17.910 --> 38:20.163
Oh my god, what's going on?

38:21.030 --> 38:22.681
Dad, Dad, what's this?

38:22.683 --> 38:23.638
I'm doing nothing!

38:23.640 --> 38:24.471
What's this, then?

38:24.473 --> 38:25.888
Why have to taken everything
out of the cupboards?

38:25.890 --> 38:27.657
What's going on?

38:27.659 --> 38:29.846
I want a coffee.

38:29.848 --> 38:31.358
Well, there's the bloody coffee, look.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.458
Right there in front of your face!

38:33.460 --> 38:35.008
What's this?

38:35.010 --> 38:36.546
I can't believe this, go
and sit in the lounge.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.288
Oh, what is all this yelling about?

38:38.290 --> 38:39.368
I'm on night shift, remember?

38:39.370 --> 38:40.868
Well, can't you see what he's done?

38:40.870 --> 38:42.146
Look at the mess!

38:42.148 --> 38:43.538
Okay, so what, just leave it.

38:43.540 --> 38:44.928
I'll tidy it in the morning.

38:44.930 --> 38:46.568
Oh, right, right, so you sleep,

38:46.570 --> 38:49.087
and you think I can just
sit here with all of this?

38:49.089 --> 38:50.346
- Get in the living room!
- Okay, Jackie!

38:50.348 --> 38:53.141
- Get in the living room!
- Jackie!

38:53.143 --> 38:56.918
Robert, go and watch a bit
of footie on TV, all right?

38:56.920 --> 38:58.728
Jackie's gonna make you a coffee.

38:58.730 --> 39:01.663
I'm making him a bloody coffee!

39:17.177 --> 39:19.358
What's that all about?

39:19.360 --> 39:20.488
The mess.

39:20.490 --> 39:22.077
Well, it's happened before.

39:30.860 --> 39:31.873
This came today.

39:37.345 --> 39:39.494
Oh shit.

39:39.496 --> 39:41.358
We owe a fortune.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.423
There's no way we can pay?

39:45.700 --> 39:47.200
I'm not sure what we can do.

39:49.924 --> 39:53.561
We'll have to sell this pad for debt.

39:53.563 --> 39:56.836
No, don't bother making me a coffee.

39:56.838 --> 39:58.439
I have to go to sleep.

39:58.441 --> 39:59.430
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

39:59.432 --> 40:00.745
All right, it's only, ain't it?

40:00.747 --> 40:02.450
What, gin?

40:02.452 --> 40:04.948
It's a nightcap, help me get to sleep.

40:04.950 --> 40:07.518
Why can't you work the day shift, Sean?

40:07.520 --> 40:10.288
Because I'm new to bar work.

40:10.290 --> 40:13.248
Because I'm working all
hours that God sends me

40:13.250 --> 40:15.548
to help you and your old man.

40:15.550 --> 40:18.100
Besides, you're only doing
part-time work as it is.

40:20.450 --> 40:23.660
We're gonna have to downsize or

40:24.790 --> 40:26.740
move somewhere cheaper up in the hills.

40:28.110 --> 40:30.188
But then the layout will be different,

40:30.190 --> 40:32.883
and Dad'll be confused by it.

40:36.260 --> 40:39.253
We're talking about selling
my parents' house here, Sean.

40:40.148 --> 40:41.819
And what choice have we got?

40:48.777 --> 40:51.527
♪ Doodah, doodah ♪

40:54.510 --> 40:56.488
What do you mean, you've been evicted?

40:56.490 --> 40:58.468
They chucked us out,
I can't pay the rent.

40:58.470 --> 41:01.488
Well, you haven't got a
job, have ya, that's why.

41:01.490 --> 41:02.761
Well, that's what I
wanted to ask you about.

41:02.763 --> 41:04.058
Yeah, I wondered if
there was something else.

41:04.060 --> 41:05.438
What is it, what's on your mind?

41:05.440 --> 41:06.773
Well, the job.

41:07.780 --> 41:10.018
Can I come back?

41:10.020 --> 41:12.888
Look, I'd love to say
yes, all right, but I can't.

41:12.890 --> 41:15.048
I've got another fellow
starting Monday, all right?

41:15.050 --> 41:17.598
He's a local lad, and he's
supposed to be very, very good.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.658
You let me down.

41:18.660 --> 41:20.238
I can't go back there, mate, honestly.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.071
Yeah, but mate, you don't know him.

41:21.073 --> 41:22.478
Listen, there's no going back.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.798
What I can do is I can
give my mate a call.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.198
He's off to America for two years,

41:26.200 --> 41:27.418
and he's desperate to get someone

41:27.420 --> 41:29.298
to look after his house for nothing.

41:29.300 --> 41:31.138
So, I'll call him, and
we'll get you in there.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.108
At least you haven't got to pay rent,

41:32.110 --> 41:34.593
but I cannot give you a job
back here, mate, I'm sorry.

41:35.484 --> 41:37.438
Mate, I've got to,
listen, you'll have to go,

41:37.440 --> 41:39.448
'cause I know you're gonna be
giving them puppy dog eyes.

41:39.450 --> 41:40.718
I can't do it.

41:40.720 --> 41:43.020
I'll see you at darts
on Tuesday, go on, mate.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.988
Oh, well, I'll see you then.

41:45.990 --> 41:47.624
Yeah, I'll see you
later, mate, take it easy.

42:15.705 --> 42:16.536
You all right?

42:16.538 --> 42:17.776
Are you not ready yet?

42:17.778 --> 42:19.235
No, I was having a shower, haven't I?

42:19.237 --> 42:20.908
Yeah, Sean, we've got so much to do.

42:20.910 --> 42:22.303
Can you just hurry up, please?

42:22.305 --> 42:23.138
Look, all right, look.

42:23.991 --> 42:25.241
- Ah!
- Oh fuck!

42:28.228 --> 42:29.505
I'll get a dustpan and brush.

42:29.507 --> 42:30.340
Oh god!

42:34.511 --> 42:37.200
♪ Day, doodah, doodah day ♪

42:37.202 --> 42:39.048
♪ Doodah, doodah day ♪

42:39.050 --> 42:41.333
Dad, can you just stop, please?

42:44.700 --> 42:46.850
Just two minutes, please, Dad, just...

43:30.801 --> 43:32.663
- On the table.
- Uh-huh.

43:34.840 --> 43:36.818
Get as much out as we can.

43:36.820 --> 43:40.964
Maybe up there?

43:40.966 --> 43:41.799
Dad?

43:43.566 --> 43:45.149
Dad, you all right?

43:46.167 --> 43:48.039
Where's the bathroom?

43:48.041 --> 43:49.978
This is going to be your bathroom.

43:49.980 --> 43:52.267
Very own bathroom, how lucky, eh?

43:53.630 --> 43:54.978
Right, there's the light switch.

43:54.980 --> 43:56.108
Can you do it?

43:56.110 --> 43:57.610
Okay.

43:59.860 --> 44:01.283
I'll just be here, okay?

44:06.690 --> 44:07.523
Dad.

44:08.416 --> 44:09.249
Dad.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.630
I'm really worried about him, Sean.

44:12.632 --> 44:13.874
Why, what's wrong?

44:13.876 --> 44:16.668
The layout's different,
there's a swimming pool.

44:16.670 --> 44:18.398
Jack, we're lucky to be here.

44:18.400 --> 44:20.448
I know that, I'm not being ungracious.

44:20.450 --> 44:23.178
I'm just saying, you know,
the furniture's different,

44:23.180 --> 44:25.745
there's nothing that's familiar for him.

44:25.747 --> 44:26.831
It's gonna confuse him.

44:26.833 --> 44:29.333
Well, where'd you rather be?

44:45.374 --> 44:47.102
Um, it's a bit dead in here.

44:47.104 --> 44:47.935
Would you mind if I knock off?

44:47.937 --> 44:49.437
Yep, no problem.

45:32.028 --> 45:34.968
Six o'clock in the
morning, what the hell's...

45:34.970 --> 45:35.803
Dad?

45:36.990 --> 45:38.328
- Oh my god, stop.
- I'm late!

45:38.330 --> 45:39.808
Stop, what are you doing?

45:39.810 --> 45:40.641
I've gotta go to work.

45:40.643 --> 45:41.474
- I'm late.
- Dad, you retired

45:41.476 --> 45:42.755
from the police, stop.

45:42.757 --> 45:43.588
I know that, but I'm late.

45:43.590 --> 45:46.128
Dad, you retired from
Mountain Rescue as well.

45:46.130 --> 45:48.508
- Stop it, stop.
- I'm late.

45:48.510 --> 45:50.033
Calm down, look.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.506
- Look, Dad, stop.
- Robert, come on, come on.

45:54.508 --> 45:57.088
Come on, Rob, come on.

45:57.090 --> 45:58.728
Look, see?

45:58.730 --> 46:01.158
D'you remember, on your last
day, we brought this down?

46:01.160 --> 46:02.780
Oh yeah, I remember, Spud.

46:02.782 --> 46:04.078
- Yeah?
- Spud, I've got to go.

46:04.080 --> 46:06.218
No, Dad, stop.

46:06.220 --> 46:08.806
Calm down, you need to
get back into bed, okay?

46:08.808 --> 46:09.641
It's 6:00 A.M.

46:11.262 --> 46:13.031
Rob, come on, come on.

46:13.033 --> 46:15.088
I've got to go to bed myself.

46:15.090 --> 46:16.843
Come on, we all need some sleep, yeah?

46:19.583 --> 46:22.351
And it's another 20
minutes away from work.

46:22.353 --> 46:23.398
It's a nightmare.

46:23.400 --> 46:25.568
Yeah, but it's spacious,
you've got a pool.

46:25.570 --> 46:28.248
Yeah, which Dad might fall into.

46:28.250 --> 46:30.018
And he's got to maintain it.

46:30.020 --> 46:31.918
It's probably how he
got it so cheap, though.

- Hey!

49:44.030 --> 49:46.598
Wow, you scrub up well, don't you?

49:46.600 --> 49:47.979
You're not bad yourself.

49:47.981 --> 49:48.812

50:02.442 --> 50:04.399
No, no, stay here.

50:04.401 --> 50:05.232
Have a beer.

50:05.234 --> 50:07.842
You're a bad influence.

50:26.459 --> 50:27.709

Cheers.

Well what?

50:46.578 --> 50:47.409
Well, are you coming?

50:47.411 --> 50:49.225

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

- Beer.
- Beer.

We're matching.

52:14.095 --> 52:15.617
- Color-coordinated.
- I know you.

52:15.619 --> 52:17.098
Yeah, you know me, Bob.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.708
It's Eva, Jackie's friend.

52:18.710 --> 52:20.583
Now, Eve, yes, yes.

52:21.830 --> 52:25.408
She's always bringing her
friends home from school

52:25.410 --> 52:27.678
for ice cream and strawberries.

52:27.680 --> 52:30.088
- Yeah?
- Oh, lovely, lovely.

52:30.090 --> 52:31.958
Shall we go and have some
ice cream and strawberries?

52:31.960 --> 52:32.791
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yeah?

52:32.793 --> 52:34.148
Have you got chocolate sauce?

52:34.150 --> 52:35.574
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

52:35.576 --> 52:40.576
Let's go in, okay.

52:55.771 --> 52:57.768
Oh, Mike, Mike, Mike, now listen.

52:57.770 --> 52:58.908
I told you last month.

52:58.910 --> 53:02.158
You honestly haven't made
a decision yet, have you?

53:02.160 --> 53:04.614
Now, you know I'm retiring
in a couple of months,

53:04.616 --> 53:05.768
and I haven't heard from you.

53:05.770 --> 53:07.508
So, I'm afraid to push
you, and everything,

53:07.510 --> 53:10.048
but you really need to
get on with it, Mike.

53:10.050 --> 53:12.703
Yes, will do, don't you worry about it.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.298
That must've been the spring.

53:17.300 --> 53:18.456
There's blossom on the trees.

53:18.458 --> 53:19.378
Yes, yes.

53:19.380 --> 53:20.838
Oh yeah, you've shown me
this one before, haven't you?

53:20.840 --> 53:24.488
That was the day when
Margaret Thatcher was...

53:24.490 --> 53:26.978
Margaret Thatcher, yeah,
became prime minister.

53:26.980 --> 53:29.322
The first lady prime minister

53:29.324 --> 53:30.550
- of this country.
- You were there, weren't you?

53:30.552 --> 53:31.698
I was there, yeah.

53:31.700 --> 53:32.700
Which one are you?

53:33.557 --> 53:35.260
I'm quite easy to find, I'm in uniform.

53:35.262 --> 53:37.508
In uniform with the hat.

53:37.510 --> 53:40.615
I think it's this one, yeah?

53:40.617 --> 53:41.908
That's me, yeah, that's me.

53:41.910 --> 53:44.409
I was in the police station.

53:44.411 --> 53:45.848
The superintendent came out,

53:45.850 --> 53:47.838
said, "What are you doing, lad?"

53:47.840 --> 53:48.671
I said, "Nothing, sir."

53:48.673 --> 53:51.325
He said, "Well, get down to Flood Street.

53:51.327 --> 53:56.327
"Mrs. Thatcher, this MP, she's
gonna be prime minister."

53:57.030 --> 53:58.676
Winston Churchill, you remember him?

53:58.678 --> 54:00.428
Yeah, well.

54:00.430 --> 54:02.708
I was at his funeral.

54:02.710 --> 54:05.338
Big, big procession.

54:05.340 --> 54:07.608
It was a good occasion,
but I was totally bored,

54:07.610 --> 54:08.441
because you just stand there,

54:08.443 --> 54:11.288
and it was a cold,
freezing day in January.

54:11.290 --> 54:13.760
Yeah, so I'm stamping me feet.

54:15.555 --> 54:16.522
You all right?

54:16.524 --> 54:17.774
I don't know.

54:19.145 --> 54:20.423
I feel strange.

54:22.260 --> 54:23.893
Am I gonna be okay?

54:23.895 --> 54:25.595
Bob, you're gonna be fine.

54:27.110 --> 54:28.775
Oh, what's happening?

55:00.830 --> 55:01.663
Well?

55:05.870 --> 55:08.780
Good in a way, ain't that, I suppose?

55:08.782 --> 55:10.553
Yeah, I suppose so.

55:10.555 --> 55:12.800
Consider everything that's going on.

55:12.802 --> 55:16.543
I can't but feel
disappointed, though, somehow.

55:20.292 --> 55:21.458
But why?

55:21.460 --> 55:23.480
Because I'm running out of time, Sean,

55:23.482 --> 55:25.963
and I wanna be a mum someday.

55:26.973 --> 55:28.963
But we will.

55:28.965 --> 55:30.178
We've got plenty of time.

55:30.180 --> 55:32.278
There's never gonna be
a good time, is there?

55:32.280 --> 55:35.320
And I don't have plenty of time.

55:35.322 --> 55:36.954
Look, don't worry, it'll be all right.

55:36.956 --> 55:38.968
It's not gonna be all right, is it?

55:38.970 --> 55:40.678
Yes, of course it is.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.288
You keep saying it's gonna be all right,

55:42.290 --> 55:44.613
but Dad's the way he is.

55:46.700 --> 55:49.550
You know, maybe this would've
forced something to change.

55:50.820 --> 55:52.928
Something else to focus on, you know?

55:52.930 --> 55:54.948
Come on, there's just gonna
be more hassle, ain't there?

55:54.950 --> 55:56.878
No, it'd be something positive.

55:56.880 --> 55:58.880
If anything, this is a negative thing.

56:00.480 --> 56:02.148
So, you're
saying having a baby with me

56:02.150 --> 56:04.328
would be a negative thing?

56:04.330 --> 56:06.388
Well, at the moment, yes.

56:06.390 --> 56:09.058
Oh, you can be really
hurtful when you want to be.

56:09.060 --> 56:12.629
D'you know, you wouldn't
mind being on your own?

56:12.631 --> 56:14.298
I think you need it.

56:17.750 --> 56:19.500
I'm gonna go to work.

56:31.021 --> 56:31.939
Hi!

56:31.941 --> 56:32.941
Hey, love.

56:36.356 --> 56:37.312
Hi.

56:37.314 --> 56:38.449
Hello.

56:38.451 --> 56:39.584
Just seen you come in.

56:39.586 --> 56:40.468
Can I buy you a drink?

56:40.470 --> 56:42.983
Oh, I'm okay, thanks, I'm
just here to see my friend.

56:42.985 --> 56:44.746
Come on, have something with me.

56:44.748 --> 56:45.871
- No.
- Something little.

56:45.873 --> 56:48.168
Just a shot, or something.

56:48.170 --> 56:49.272
Maybe later.

56:49.274 --> 56:50.626
- You sure?
- Yeah.

56:50.628 --> 56:51.961
See you later.

56:53.147 --> 56:55.037
Can't a girl just get
a drink around here?

56:55.039 --> 56:56.909
Hell if I knew.

56:56.911 --> 56:58.827
I'd hassle you myself
if I weren't working.

56:58.829 --> 57:00.516
You are a terrible flirt.

57:00.518 --> 57:03.435
Guilty.

57:04.764 --> 57:06.190
What time do you finish?

57:06.192 --> 57:08.894
I have the afternoon shift, so,

57:08.896 --> 57:10.399
we are gonna have a few drinks.

57:10.401 --> 57:11.369
Yay!

57:11.371 --> 57:14.020
Speaking of which, yeah,

57:14.022 --> 57:16.643
you see, old Robert's
been doing my head in,

57:16.645 --> 57:19.116
so I haven't been able to sleep, so,

57:19.118 --> 57:22.228
I feel we both deserve
a nice little drink.

57:22.230 --> 57:23.723
What is it?

57:23.725 --> 57:25.686
I don't know, just drink it.

57:31.422 --> 57:32.966
Oh!

57:32.968 --> 57:34.490
Right, let's have another one.

57:34.492 --> 57:35.323
Another?

57:35.325 --> 57:38.325
I won't say anything if you won't.

57:42.546 --> 57:44.120
- Oh!
- Look at you.

58:02.572 --> 58:05.989
♪ Doodah, doodah, doodah ♪

58:29.344 --> 58:31.677
I'm gonna get out of here.

59:07.552 --> 59:11.272
♪ Doodah, doodah ♪

59:11.274 --> 59:15.046
♪ Doo de doo de doo, doo de doo de doo ♪

59:15.048 --> 59:16.705
♪ Doodah, doodah ♪

59:16.707 --> 59:21.206
What are you doing?

59:21.208 --> 59:22.895
What are you doing, it's
6:00 in the morning.

59:22.897 --> 59:25.730
You'll burn the bloody place down.

59:41.217 --> 59:42.868
Jackie!

59:42.870 --> 59:43.703
Jesus!

59:54.630 --> 59:55.463
Sean?

59:56.698 --> 59:59.448
How many of these have you had?

1:00:01.371 --> 1:00:03.204
About three or four.

1:00:06.050 --> 1:00:06.950
What's the matter?

1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:11.218
I've got him in there
burning the house down.

1:00:11.220 --> 1:00:12.051
- What?
- No, no, no.

1:00:12.053 --> 1:00:13.383
It's fine, it's fine.

1:00:15.110 --> 1:00:16.638
I've got him thinking he's Gordon Ramsay

1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:17.835
cooking the bloody sausages out there,

1:00:17.837 --> 1:00:21.320
and you thinking you're bloody
Marilyn Monroe in a rave.

1:00:23.470 --> 1:00:24.303
Sorry.

1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:30.468
Oh, you smell of booze;
how much have you had?

1:00:30.470 --> 1:00:33.728
He was just standing
there, the big freak,

1:00:33.730 --> 1:00:36.732
cooking sausages, not a care in the world.

1:00:36.734 --> 1:00:37.908
All jokes aside, Jackie, I...

1:00:37.910 --> 1:00:41.338
Oh, Sean, please don't make me, please.

1:00:41.340 --> 1:00:43.393
I can't put him in a home, you know this.

1:00:44.670 --> 1:00:46.453
I'm not going over it again with you.

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:49.760
Yeah, I realise that, but...

1:00:51.701 --> 1:00:54.842
I think it's us that's failing him.

1:01:16.905 --> 1:01:17.905
Hey.

1:01:19.020 --> 1:01:21.988
So, Sean and
I had a chat last night.

1:01:21.990 --> 1:01:23.413
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

1:01:24.810 --> 1:01:27.160
I think I am gonna go
for that managerial role.

1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:32.032
Right, well, we need to
get you spruced up, then.

1:01:32.034 --> 1:01:33.011
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

1:01:33.013 --> 1:01:34.518
We need a pamper night.

1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:36.138
- Oh, no.
- Yes, come on.

1:01:36.140 --> 1:01:38.295
If you're gonna go for that,
you gotta look your best.

1:01:38.297 --> 1:01:42.050
You know, your face back,
feet up, I'd do your nails.

1:01:42.052 --> 1:01:43.289
It's so much fun, come on.

1:01:43.291 --> 1:01:44.494
- Really?
- Get you spruced up,

1:01:44.496 --> 1:01:45.588
looking like your old self again.

1:01:45.590 --> 1:01:48.223
Oh, I wish you could
come round every week.

1:01:49.420 --> 1:01:52.288
- Speaking of which.
- Oh, yeah, so,

1:01:52.290 --> 1:01:54.878
he came back about an hour later.

1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:57.573
Yeah, he starts asking all
these questions about you.

1:01:59.130 --> 1:02:01.378
Were you in a relationship with someone,

1:02:01.380 --> 1:02:04.418
and did I think you might be interested

1:02:04.420 --> 1:02:05.948
in going on a date with him,

1:02:05.950 --> 1:02:08.343
and, like, would I give him your number.

1:02:09.592 --> 1:02:11.743
Oh, you're kidding.

1:02:11.745 --> 1:02:13.073
No, seriously.

1:02:14.490 --> 1:02:16.788
But obviously, I didn't give that to him,

1:02:16.790 --> 1:02:18.968
but I did take his business card.

1:02:18.970 --> 1:02:20.712
I feel terrible.

1:02:20.714 --> 1:02:21.708
- What?
- I'm not sure

1:02:21.710 --> 1:02:23.068
I shut the front door
of the shop properly,

1:02:23.070 --> 1:02:24.878
like, that I locked it.

1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:27.608
I'm not completely 100% sure.

1:02:27.610 --> 1:02:28.578
- I'm gonna have to dash.
- Eva!

1:02:28.580 --> 1:02:30.006
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

1:02:30.008 --> 1:02:31.023
- No!
- Yeah.

1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:33.528
- Sean.
- Hi, Eva.

1:02:33.530 --> 1:02:35.738
Oh, hi, you're off work early.

1:02:35.740 --> 1:02:37.457
Yeah.

1:02:37.459 --> 1:02:38.290
Good night?

1:02:38.292 --> 1:02:40.988
Yeah.

1:02:40.990 --> 1:02:43.186
We did a bit of a pampering session.

1:02:43.188 --> 1:02:44.720
Oh, oh, okay.

1:02:44.722 --> 1:02:45.823
Are they for me?

1:02:45.825 --> 1:02:47.335
Yeah.

1:02:47.337 --> 1:02:48.905
Oh, really?

1:02:48.907 --> 1:02:51.490
I bought them for you.

1:02:52.331 --> 1:02:53.881
What did I do to deserve these?

1:02:53.883 --> 1:02:56.039
Blimey, I'm being really
pampered at the moment.

1:02:56.041 --> 1:02:58.048
I know, you deserve it.

1:02:58.050 --> 1:02:59.168
Well, what have I done?

1:02:59.170 --> 1:03:01.698
You haven't done anything,
I haven't anything.

1:03:01.700 --> 1:03:03.383
No one's done nothing.

1:03:13.450 --> 1:03:16.320
Honestly, you haven't made
a decision yet, have you?

1:03:16.322 --> 1:03:18.668
I have made a decision,

1:03:18.670 --> 1:03:20.753
but I think I should tell her first.

1:03:33.660 --> 1:03:34.663
Hey, boss.

1:03:35.930 --> 1:03:37.630
It's nice to know I'm appreciated.

1:03:38.470 --> 1:03:40.613
Wow, I don't know, manager's position?

1:03:42.470 --> 1:03:43.303
Yeah.

1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:46.067
Can I get back to you?

1:04:01.388 --> 1:04:02.344
- Dad.
- I want to see.

1:04:02.346 --> 1:04:05.710
Where is Spud, for
goodness' sake, where is he?

1:04:05.712 --> 1:04:07.262
Dad, Spud's not coming today.

1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:11.168
I want to see him.

1:04:11.170 --> 1:04:12.441
I know.

1:04:12.443 --> 1:04:14.220
I like him, but I just want to see him.

1:04:14.222 --> 1:04:15.833
- I know, I know.
- Where is he?

1:04:15.835 --> 1:04:18.471
He said he'd come next week.

1:04:18.473 --> 1:04:20.449
I don't know what to do.

1:04:25.778 --> 1:04:27.588
Have you noticed how
much Sean's been drinking

1:04:27.590 --> 1:04:29.518
every time we see him?

1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:31.028
Well, actually, now that you've said it.

1:04:31.030 --> 1:04:32.238
- Yeah.
- Oh dear.

1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:33.098
We had a few too many.

1:04:33.100 --> 1:04:34.088
Together?

1:04:34.090 --> 1:04:35.808
Head.

1:04:35.810 --> 1:04:37.883
And we had a bit of a moment.

1:04:39.389 --> 1:04:40.658
She doesn't know, does she?

1:04:40.660 --> 1:04:41.493
No!

1:04:43.750 --> 1:04:44.917
You're not gonna say anything, right?

1:04:44.919 --> 1:04:45.750
No, I'm not.

1:04:45.752 --> 1:04:47.774
Okay, girls, to the poles.

1:04:47.776 --> 1:04:48.943
Let's do it.

1:04:50.630 --> 1:04:51.683
Oh, come on.

1:04:52.664 --> 1:04:53.664
Oh, come on!

1:04:58.598 --> 1:05:00.258
- What?
- Yeah, fluke.

1:05:00.260 --> 1:05:01.910
So, I've got a bit of a quandary.

1:05:02.870 --> 1:05:04.698
Oh dear, why, what's up?

1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:08.988
Boss at work has offered
me the manager's job.

1:05:08.990 --> 1:05:10.548
Oh, congratulations.

1:05:10.550 --> 1:05:12.748
Yeah, not really.

1:05:12.750 --> 1:05:13.928
Oh, how come?

1:05:13.930 --> 1:05:15.233
Jackie really wanted it.

1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:18.930
I won't wanna be in
your shoes right now.

1:05:20.228 --> 1:05:22.211
I don't know what to do.

1:05:22.213 --> 1:05:23.365
I want my dinner.

1:05:23.367 --> 1:05:24.854
But you just had your dinner.

1:05:24.856 --> 1:05:25.687
- No, I haven't.
- You did.

1:05:25.689 --> 1:05:26.748
You had it 10 minutes ago.

1:05:26.750 --> 1:05:28.128
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

1:05:28.130 --> 1:05:29.416
Jacket potato.

1:05:29.418 --> 1:05:31.298
I didn't, I know I didn't have it.

1:05:31.300 --> 1:05:33.895
Jacket potato, beans, cheese.

1:05:33.897 --> 1:05:36.711
Where's Spud anyway, where's Spud?

1:05:36.713 --> 1:05:38.440
Dad, Spud's not coming today.

1:05:38.442 --> 1:05:39.275
Oh.

1:05:40.999 --> 1:05:42.299
Now, go and get my dinner.

1:05:43.570 --> 1:05:44.858
Go on, now.

1:05:44.860 --> 1:05:45.851
You've already had your dinner.

1:05:45.853 --> 1:05:47.238
You had it 10 minutes ago.

1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:48.688
I haven't.

1:05:48.690 --> 1:05:50.030
I know I haven't.

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:53.018
Spud let Dad down again today.

1:05:53.020 --> 1:05:54.598
- Did he?
- How long do you think

1:05:54.600 --> 1:05:55.431
that's been now?

1:05:55.433 --> 1:05:56.751
About six months.

1:05:56.753 --> 1:05:58.525
It's just not on, is it?

1:05:58.527 --> 1:05:59.358
I don't know.

1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:01.468
I haven't seen some of my
mates since six months.

1:06:01.470 --> 1:06:02.908
If the tables were turned, Sean,

1:06:02.910 --> 1:06:04.210
Dad wouldn't do it to him.

1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:07.723
It's absolutely disgusting, I'm livid.

1:06:20.381 --> 1:06:21.212
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:06:21.214 --> 1:06:23.888
As you know, Marjorie's leaving soon,

1:06:23.890 --> 1:06:25.448
and I have been watching you carefully,

1:06:25.450 --> 1:06:27.818
and you do make a big
effort with the customers,

1:06:27.820 --> 1:06:29.688
especially over the last few months,

1:06:29.690 --> 1:06:31.898
so I'd like to offer you the job.

1:06:31.900 --> 1:06:33.555
Really?

1:06:33.557 --> 1:06:34.598
I really appreciate it,

1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:36.998
but I think you should give it to Jackie.

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.226
I would've preferred to have you,

1:06:39.228 --> 1:06:41.128
but if it's not to be, it's not to be.

Oh, it's okay.

1:07:17.913 --> 1:07:21.078
Well, it's a big job, this garden.

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:23.728
I'm probably not gonna have
that much time in the future.

1:07:23.730 --> 1:07:24.580
How come?

1:07:25.550 --> 1:07:27.858
Mike offered me that manager's role.

1:07:27.860 --> 1:07:29.118
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:31.248
Oh, that's amazing, well done!

1:07:31.250 --> 1:07:34.208

1:07:34.210 --> 1:07:36.848
Well, yeah, it's mine.

1:07:36.850 --> 1:07:38.948
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1:07:38.950 --> 1:07:41.428
I'm surprised you didn't
go for it, actually.

1:07:41.430 --> 1:07:43.485
No, not really for me.

1:07:43.487 --> 1:07:44.320
Really?

1:07:45.170 --> 1:07:47.220
I think you'd have been quite good at it.

1:07:48.292 --> 1:07:49.143
I think it suits you better.

1:07:49.145 --> 1:07:50.594
Oh!

1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:57.308
Oh, hey, it's Dad's birthday
on Sunday, his meal.

1:07:57.310 --> 1:07:58.271
You haven't forgotten, eh?

1:07:58.273 --> 1:07:59.668
No, I'm gonna be there.

1:07:59.670 --> 1:08:00.888
Good.

1:08:00.890 --> 1:08:02.418
'Cause you'll be the light relief

1:08:02.420 --> 1:08:05.471
if the rubbish would happen.

1:08:16.293 --> 1:08:18.398
Right, here we
go, bit of red wine for ya.

1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:19.658
There we go, lovely.

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:21.226
Get your laughing gear around that, eh?

1:08:21.228 --> 1:08:23.818
- Yeah.
- Lovely, all right.

1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:25.724
All right, another one for you there.

1:08:25.726 --> 1:08:28.223
Dad?

1:08:28.225 --> 1:08:29.642
- Hello!
- Hi, hi!

1:08:31.543 --> 1:08:33.626
Oh, thank you for coming.

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:36.818
- He's over here.
- Oh, there he is.

1:08:36.820 --> 1:08:38.203
- Birthday boy.
- Dad?

1:08:39.070 --> 1:08:40.104
Happy birthday, Bob.

1:08:40.106 --> 1:08:41.106
- Dad?
- Bob?

1:08:42.504 --> 1:08:43.498
- Hmm?
- Hello.

1:08:43.500 --> 1:08:44.458
Dad, it's Eva.

1:08:44.460 --> 1:08:45.745
She's come to wish you happy birthday.

1:08:45.747 --> 1:08:47.664
Happy birthday, mwah.

1:08:49.705 --> 1:08:52.655
- I think...
- Yeah, that's it.

1:08:52.657 --> 1:08:54.543
You can do it.

1:08:54.545 --> 1:08:55.378
Okay, so.

1:08:56.773 --> 1:08:57.690

1:09:25.126 --> 1:09:25.957
You feeling a bit tired?

1:09:25.959 --> 1:09:27.233
Oh, let's sit you down.

1:09:30.970 --> 1:09:33.018
Sean's outside, if you
wanna go and grab a drink,

1:09:33.020 --> 1:09:34.567
or give him a hand.

1:09:37.340 --> 1:09:38.171
Hey, Sean.

1:09:38.173 --> 1:09:39.133
Oh, Eva.

1:09:40.177 --> 1:09:41.090
Do you want a drink?

1:09:43.172 --> 1:09:44.987
Yeah, just some wine.

1:09:44.989 --> 1:09:45.989
All right.

1:09:46.976 --> 1:09:51.062
You know what happens
when we drink together.

1:09:51.064 --> 1:09:52.326
Maybe a bit more.

1:09:52.328 --> 1:09:53.746
Yeah.

1:09:53.748 --> 1:09:57.199
Just, we've had too much.

1:09:57.201 --> 1:10:00.149
Help yourself to a samosa.

1:10:00.151 --> 1:10:01.738
Not too many, mind.

1:10:01.740 --> 1:10:03.594
It gives you havoc on your bowels.

1:10:04.750 --> 1:10:06.157
Hello, surprise!

1:10:06.159 --> 1:10:07.742
Oh my god, Rosie!

1:10:10.358 --> 1:10:11.528
What are you doing here?

1:10:11.530 --> 1:10:13.628
I had to come back to
get the rest of my stuff,

1:10:13.630 --> 1:10:15.548
so I thought I'd time it
in for Robert's birthday,

1:10:15.550 --> 1:10:17.251
so I could be here.

1:10:17.253 --> 1:10:19.128
- How kind of you.
- Oh, it's okay.

1:10:19.130 --> 1:10:20.103
How's he doing?

1:10:20.963 --> 1:10:22.085
Not so good.

1:10:22.087 --> 1:10:23.648
But he'll be delighted

1:10:23.650 --> 1:10:24.698
- to see you.
- I'll go say hello.

1:10:24.700 --> 1:10:25.704
Dad.

1:10:25.706 --> 1:10:26.873
Hey, Robert.

1:10:27.973 --> 1:10:28.804
Hmm?

1:10:28.806 --> 1:10:31.904
How's it going, happy birthday.

1:10:31.906 --> 1:10:33.739
Mwah, how you feeling?

1:10:34.928 --> 1:10:36.527
Okay?

1:10:36.529 --> 1:10:37.963
Oh.

1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:51.307
Shit party, ain't it?

1:11:01.123 --> 1:11:03.540
Bit like our lives, isn't it?

1:11:08.587 --> 1:11:10.038
I'm so sorry, Rosie.

1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:12.153
I know I should've told you, but,

1:11:13.980 --> 1:11:16.280
I just didn't want to
accept how bad he'd got.

1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:20.548
I just, I don't
understand what happened.

1:11:20.550 --> 1:11:23.318
Well, the doctor says that he's having

1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:26.863
hundreds of tiny strokes all the time.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.018
When things start to
go wrong in the brain,

1:11:30.020 --> 1:11:33.520
you just can't tell how
it's gonna affect them.

1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:36.158
I was just so shocked, 'cause he just,

1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:37.473
he didn't recognise me.

1:11:38.732 --> 1:11:40.321
I'm sorry.

1:11:40.323 --> 1:11:41.538
Hey, it's okay.

1:11:41.540 --> 1:11:45.613
It's just, there's hundreds
of tiny strokes, and each,

1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:49.000
each one is taking a little
bit of of my dad away.

1:11:50.023 --> 1:11:50.856
I'm sorry.

1:11:54.137 --> 1:11:56.381
Here's to Dad, eh?

1:11:56.383 --> 1:11:58.098
Cheers, to Robert.

1:11:58.100 --> 1:11:59.387
Or what's left of him.

1:12:08.272 --> 1:12:09.272
Hey, Spud.

1:12:10.225 --> 1:12:12.561
Hey, look, Bob, Spud.

1:12:12.563 --> 1:12:14.988
Happy birthday, Robert, I
made this for your birthday.

1:12:14.990 --> 1:12:17.138
That's kind, isn't it?

1:12:17.140 --> 1:12:18.190
Go on, well, take it.

1:12:19.701 --> 1:12:21.951
Get yourself a drink, Spud.

1:12:23.740 --> 1:12:25.911
You used to work up in the mountains.

1:12:25.913 --> 1:12:27.208
Yeah, of course it is, look.

1:12:27.210 --> 1:12:28.593
Look at the shape.

1:12:30.834 --> 1:12:33.525
He got you this as well,
it's the shape of Tenerife.

1:12:33.527 --> 1:12:35.377
You used to work up in the mountains.

1:12:38.750 --> 1:12:40.976
I'm gonna miss you, yeah.

1:12:40.978 --> 1:12:42.645
Look after yourself.

1:12:43.489 --> 1:12:44.909
Okay.

1:13:12.604 --> 1:13:13.848
You know,

1:13:13.850 --> 1:13:17.160
sometimes I really hate
myself for thinking about...

1:13:21.820 --> 1:13:22.863
I wish he were dead.

1:13:26.519 --> 1:13:29.210
I mean, I don't actually mean
I wish he were dead, but,

1:13:32.100 --> 1:13:33.700
if he were to die, then...

1:13:37.370 --> 1:13:41.233
I just wish he could do it with
some more dignity than this.

1:13:42.807 --> 1:13:45.820
Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean, yeah.

1:13:47.380 --> 1:13:50.180
I couldn't stand the looks
he was getting today, Sean.

1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:52.103
I couldn't bear it.

1:13:53.010 --> 1:13:54.410
Come on, we're used to it.

1:13:56.055 --> 1:13:56.888
Yeah.

1:13:59.453 --> 1:14:03.173
Yeah, I know, but I just
felt so ashamed of him.

1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:08.873
I don't wanna feel ashamed of him.

1:14:10.490 --> 1:14:13.275
Jackie, we gotta
remember him as we used to.

1:14:13.277 --> 1:14:18.277
You know, Big Rob, the
Robmeister, Glampost.

1:14:21.183 --> 1:14:22.016
You know?

1:14:23.590 --> 1:14:24.423
Yeah.

1:14:25.310 --> 1:14:26.143
I know.

1:14:26.987 --> 1:14:28.310
But he's just...

1:14:30.220 --> 1:14:31.093
It's just,

1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:35.983
I don't know, I want people
to remember him like that.

1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:40.630
And they're just gonna
remember him like he is now.

1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:48.703
He looks like Dad, and
he sounds just like Dad,

1:14:52.005 --> 1:14:55.287
but how much of him is there, Sean?

1:15:00.898 --> 1:15:02.231
I can't bear it.

1:15:03.820 --> 1:15:05.303
What would he do?

1:15:07.963 --> 1:15:09.463
Say, if I was Robert, right?

1:15:11.841 --> 1:15:13.893
The smart and healthy Robert.

1:15:16.103 --> 1:15:17.703
We're getting to five years now.

1:15:19.351 --> 1:15:21.559
What would he do?

1:15:25.460 --> 1:15:27.208
He was too proud.

1:15:27.210 --> 1:15:29.413
He was too proud to go like this.

1:15:31.094 --> 1:15:32.177
He'd hate it.

1:15:37.523 --> 1:15:39.573
He'd go up to the mountains, wouldn't he?

1:15:40.684 --> 1:15:41.517
Yeah.

1:15:50.180 --> 1:15:52.583
Seatbelt, Dad, seatbelt.

1:15:54.687 --> 1:15:55.937
For God's sake.

1:16:24.189 --> 1:16:25.287
In a minute, Dad.

1:16:25.289 --> 1:16:26.122
No, now.

1:18:41.854 --> 1:18:46.854
I need to wee.
