02:42.163 --> 02:44.302
Get down, damn it!

03:03.059 --> 03:05.198
I'm no Apache.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.910
Leave me be.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.327
Where are you from?

03:51.232 --> 03:52.956
Creel.

03:53.693 --> 03:57.043
That's where I'm headed.
I'll get you home.

03:57.071 --> 04:01.299
No. I've got to go
to him. He needs me.

04:02.201 --> 04:07.177
There's nothing but Apaches for 60
miles between here and Fort Creel.

04:07.206 --> 04:09.548
The Apaches won't hurt me.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.590
Mommy! Mommy!

07:32.119 --> 07:34.259
Mommy.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.171
Look.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.704
There.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.440
Good afternoon. What
can I do for you?

08:31.053 --> 08:32.611
Oh.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.324
Did you find her?

08:46.611 --> 08:50.245
- Where's the horse she was riding?
- Dead.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.923
That's too bad.

09:06.756 --> 09:10.770
- Take care of my horse.
- Where'd you find Mrs Grange?

09:10.801 --> 09:16.572
Give him plenty of feed and water.
He needs it. And rub him down too.

09:30.655 --> 09:33.590
- Hello, Harrington.
- Jess Remsberg.

09:33.616 --> 09:37.299
- I see they've made you corporal again.
- Yeah, twice.

09:37.328 --> 09:41.591
- Say, it's been a long time since...
- Yeah, yeah. It's been a long time.

09:41.624 --> 09:47.098
- Is Scotty McAllister out at the fort?
- Yeah. Did you hear he made lieutenant?

09:47.129 --> 09:50.515
- Tell him I'm in here, will you?
- Sure.

10:08.234 --> 10:10.659
Well, look at 'em out there.

10:14.156 --> 10:18.586
Watching, waiting to see
how I'm going to take it.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.842
Laughing behind my back.

10:22.999 --> 10:28.176
When they brought you back the first
time I tried to treat you decent.

10:28.212 --> 10:33.140
This time the Apaches didn't
take you away, you ran away.

10:34.844 --> 10:40.400
My horse is dead and you're back.
Should be the other way around.

10:48.024 --> 10:50.163
Stop it, Ellen.

10:53.988 --> 10:56.127
Stop that.

11:03.164 --> 11:05.719
Please. Oh, please.

11:08.502 --> 11:12.730
Please, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that. I didn't.

11:18.262 --> 11:23.238
I'm sorry, Will. I'm sorry I
was brought back to shame you.

11:23.267 --> 11:27.365
I don't like the way I feel.
I hate myself for it.

11:27.396 --> 11:32.039
- You know how I loved you.
- You were always good to me.

11:34.779 --> 11:39.375
When Chata's band took you I
just near went out of my head.

11:39.408 --> 11:43.636
I hunted for you for a whole year
until I figured they'd killed you.

11:43.663 --> 11:47.511
Then suddenly you were back and
I wanted us to start over.

11:47.541 --> 11:52.600
- There's something that happened to me.
- I don't want to hear what happened!

11:52.630 --> 11:56.015
I don't want to know
anything about it.

11:57.426 --> 12:01.773
It's bad enough just thinking about
you and them Apaches all the time.

12:01.806 --> 12:05.440
I had to go back to them.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

12:05.476 --> 12:07.652
You liked living with savages?

12:07.687 --> 12:10.906
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.

12:10.940 --> 12:13.613
Lots of white women have
been grabbed by Indians.

12:13.651 --> 12:18.579
Any decent one would have killed herself
before she let 'em turn her into a squaw.

12:18.614 --> 12:23.293
- I'm not that decent, I guess.
- Don't shout. They'll hear you.

12:23.327 --> 12:29.051
You don't care what happens to me.
Only what people think about you.

12:29.083 --> 12:34.224
- I do business with them people.
- The people who treat your wife like dirt.

12:34.255 --> 12:37.391
I was better off with the Indians.

12:38.759 --> 12:43.438
- Maybe that's where you belong.
- I don't belong here any more.

12:44.223 --> 12:46.695
Maybe you don't.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.780
At a trot, ho!

13:31.979 --> 13:36.373
- Keep in line there.
- At a gallop, ho!

13:39.737 --> 13:44.380
- Back into line.
- Left about, ho!

13:52.416 --> 13:56.894
- No!
- Get back into one line, damn it.

13:59.423 --> 14:02.228
- Gather round that flag.
- Sergeant Ferguson.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.399
That was the worst exhibition...

14:04.428 --> 14:07.399
I know, but most of these
horses aren't saddle-broke.

14:07.431 --> 14:10.817
Half your men don't know one
end of a horse from the other.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.489
Come on now, move it into line.

14:16.816 --> 14:20.119
- Lieutenant?
- What is it, Corporal?

14:20.152 --> 14:23.871
- Jess Remsberg is in town, sir.
- Jess?

14:23.906 --> 14:27.256
- How does he look?
- He still ain't over it.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.877
- Where is he?
- The saloon, sir.

14:29.912 --> 14:33.346
- Harrington, lend the sergeant a hand.
- Yes, sir.

14:33.374 --> 14:40.058
You keep those men polishing the seats of
their pants until they can do that turn.

14:40.089 --> 14:46.342
- We leave for Concho in two days.
- All right, we're going to try it once more.

14:46.679 --> 14:50.314
Forward at a gallop, ho!

15:31.932 --> 15:34.072
Whisky.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.956
Lieutenant?

15:42.985 --> 15:45.659
I've got a wagonload of
goods for Fort Concho.

15:45.696 --> 15:48.881
I'd appreciate it if I could
tag along with your troop.

15:48.908 --> 15:50.835
No.

15:52.036 --> 15:54.971
I've got a right to
army protection.

15:54.997 --> 15:58.383
If I take you along,
you do. But I'm not.

16:04.674 --> 16:08.771
My, you sure do look pretty
in that new uniform.

16:08.803 --> 16:10.231
- Lieutenant...
- Grange.

16:10.262 --> 16:15.321
This trip's going to be rough enough
without dragging along extra freight.

16:15.351 --> 16:17.490
Sorry.

16:24.610 --> 16:27.462
I hear you found Ellen
Grange on the way.

16:27.488 --> 16:32.001
Her husband didn't seem too
anxious to get her back.

16:35.413 --> 16:38.264
- Tom Van scouting for you?
- Aye.

16:38.291 --> 16:43.598
I sent him to Mexico to check how many
more warriors have joined Chata's force.

16:43.629 --> 16:47.312
I found him 60 miles south,
where I picked up Mrs Grange.

16:47.883 --> 16:51.851
I'd say he was two days
dying, Apache-style.

16:52.888 --> 16:58.327
Then Chata's already across the border,
slaughtering anyone they've run across.

16:58.352 --> 17:00.943
Not without reason, Scotty.

17:00.980 --> 17:05.125
The Apaches were holed up on that
hellhole reservation at San Carlos.

17:05.151 --> 17:09.083
- Tricked, lied to, murdered...
- It cuts both ways, Jess.

17:10.031 --> 17:13.630
Bad enough when a man like
Tom Van ends the way he did.

17:13.659 --> 17:18.468
When you find women and
children dead like that...

17:23.794 --> 17:27.512
- I've got to tell Major Novac about Van.
- Wait a minute.

17:29.425 --> 17:33.439
You sent me a message. I'm here.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.240
Aye.

17:55.201 --> 17:58.836
That's a pretty nice scalp
you got there, mister.

17:58.871 --> 18:04.048
I know where an Indian scalp like
that would bring a pretty good price.

18:04.085 --> 18:06.224
How much you want for it?

18:14.303 --> 18:17.238
- What was that?
- He was going to kill you, Toller.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.449
All I did was ask what he
wanted for the Indian scalp.

18:20.476 --> 18:22.699
This Indian was his wife.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.585
- What happened?
- I hit you.

18:41.998 --> 18:44.221
It's a good thing you did.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.600
Where is it, Scotty?

18:56.762 --> 18:59.484
- Where'd you get it?
- Fort Concho.

18:59.515 --> 19:03.660
From the town marshal.
New man. Clay Dean.

19:04.437 --> 19:06.114
Clay Dean?

19:06.147 --> 19:10.114
Aye. Killer for hire, wearing
a badge. You know the type.

19:15.906 --> 19:18.498
Thanks, Scotty.

19:18.534 --> 19:23.510
- Dean may not be the man.
- If he's not, he'll tell me.

19:23.539 --> 19:27.553
The man who caught my wife alone is
going to pay, and not just by dying.

19:27.585 --> 19:31.054
Stop it! Apaches take revenge
that way. No civilised man...

19:31.088 --> 19:37.558
That was no Apache that scalped my wife.
That was one of your civilised men!

19:37.595 --> 19:42.156
We're heading for Fort Concho in a couple
of days. I want you to come along.

19:42.183 --> 19:45.319
You just want to be with me
when I catch this man Dean.

19:45.353 --> 19:49.201
You figure I'll let him die
quick and easy if you're there.

19:49.231 --> 19:53.246
With Tom Van gone, I need a scout.

19:53.277 --> 19:54.373
No.

19:54.403 --> 19:58.204
I've two wagonloads of ammunition
and 25 green troopers.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.796
Colonel Foster needs
them in Fort Concho.

20:00.826 --> 20:03.548
What are you bucking for?

20:03.579 --> 20:09.018
I can't afford any mistakes on my record.
I'm going to be a general some day.

20:09.043 --> 20:12.642
I don't remember you being
so damned ambitious.

20:12.672 --> 20:16.022
I'm getting married
when I get to Concho.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.479
Sergeant Neabamer's daughter.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.160
She'll give you hell
if I don't get there.

20:30.106 --> 20:34.120
I guess a week or so won't
make any difference.

20:39.407 --> 20:41.832
We ought to bury that, Jess.

20:42.660 --> 20:46.129
After I find the man
that took it off her.

21:01.804 --> 21:07.574
Tell the major he'll have to wait. I got
some unfinished business to take care of.

21:33.836 --> 21:39.096
McAllister said you wanted to kill me.
I don't much like that idea.

21:42.803 --> 21:47.815
I'd rather get it over with now if
the thought's still in your mind.

21:47.850 --> 21:50.406
It's not.

21:50.436 --> 21:54.581
- Are you quite sure?
- I said so.

21:58.903 --> 22:03.416
Then I apologise.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

22:04.867 --> 22:07.007
I know you didn't.

22:44.657 --> 22:48.256
- Let her go.
- Like hell. She tried to steal our horses.

22:48.286 --> 22:50.462
She ought to be put in jail.

22:50.496 --> 22:54.641
We won't let her go till she's nice
to us, like she was to those Apaches.

22:54.667 --> 22:58.302
She shouldn't mind us after
pleasuring Chata's son.

22:58.337 --> 23:00.477
I said let her go.

23:05.219 --> 23:06.564
Sure.

24:53.494 --> 24:57.177
I didn't lay a finger on you. I was
just going to tell her husband.

24:57.206 --> 25:02.264
- You won't tell her husband anything.
- All right, I won't. I swear.

25:14.849 --> 25:19.907
I like changing odds. Two to one
seemed more of an even bet.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.721
So you saved me again, Mr Remsberg.

25:47.089 --> 25:50.024
This time you saved my honour.

25:50.051 --> 25:54.195
Only now you know there
is none left to save.

25:54.221 --> 26:00.075
- You sound like I ought to apologise.
- I didn't ask you to bring me back here.

26:00.102 --> 26:02.693
If the Apaches had
taken you captive...

26:02.730 --> 26:05.914
At least they didn't
spit when I walked past.

26:05.942 --> 26:09.411
- People here treat me like a...
- I know.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.377
I had a Comanche wife.

26:14.992 --> 26:17.251
Well, that's different.

26:17.286 --> 26:22.629
No one thinks it wrong for a man. As long
as he leaves her behind when he goes.

26:22.667 --> 26:24.806
I said she was my wife.

26:27.505 --> 26:32.017
I know how they look at you.
I know how they treat you.

26:34.679 --> 26:37.733
One of them finally killed my wife.

26:40.601 --> 26:43.655
Come on. Better get you home.

26:55.825 --> 26:59.590
I can understand why
you'd want to run away.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.472
But there's something you
ought to think about.

27:02.498 --> 27:05.006
If you go back to Chata's band,

27:05.042 --> 27:09.306
his son Nachee'll most likely kill
you for running away from him.

27:09.338 --> 27:13.650
I didn't run away. I was
taken away, unconscious.

27:14.927 --> 27:19.606
Our brave soldiers hit the Apache
camp while the men were out hunting.

27:19.640 --> 27:26.028
The trooper who gave me this almost
killed me before he saw my blonde hair.

27:28.274 --> 27:32.952
- If I were your husband...
- You are not my husband.

27:32.987 --> 27:38.627
They all think any decent woman would
rather die than live as an Apache squaw.

27:38.659 --> 27:42.923
- Maybe they're right.
- Death comes soon enough.

27:42.955 --> 27:46.341
Anybody that hurries
it is a damn fool.

27:50.296 --> 27:55.105
What I was trying to say is...
what's over is done.

27:55.134 --> 28:00.857
You two could go someplace where
nobody knows what happened to you.

28:01.599 --> 28:03.738
My husband would know.

28:25.665 --> 28:27.804
Thanks, Major.

28:28.834 --> 28:33.762
- I appreciate your cooperation.
- It's my pleasure, Mr Grange.

28:40.096 --> 28:42.235
Have a seat, Sergeant.

28:44.642 --> 28:47.945
If that was a hint you want me
back in the army, no thanks.

28:47.979 --> 28:51.613
Toller, Chata may have already
started north across the border.

28:51.649 --> 28:54.204
You know what that means.

28:54.235 --> 28:58.119
Well, as far as my re-enlisting
is concerned, no chance, Major.

28:58.155 --> 29:02.798
The army owes me for 40 horses I spent the
last four months hunting and breaking.

29:02.827 --> 29:06.675
I'm planning on investing my
stakes in a gambling saloon.

29:06.706 --> 29:09.047
No more army for me, Major.

29:10.835 --> 29:15.229
Sir, Grange claims you've allowed him
to accompany me to Fort Concho.

29:15.256 --> 29:19.817
The army has to cooperate with traders.
He's been most helpful to us.

29:19.844 --> 29:24.238
Yes, sir. But with all-green troopers
and only two days before we head out...

29:24.265 --> 29:30.735
You don't have those two days. You'll
be starting for Fort Concho at dawn.

29:30.771 --> 29:35.699
Sir, I need time to whip those raw
recruits into some kind of shape.

29:35.735 --> 29:38.586
And half Toller's horses
aren't saddle-broke.

29:38.613 --> 29:42.662
Then he will have to finish breaking
them on the way to Fort Concho.

29:42.700 --> 29:48.719
Hold it. My contract calls for delivery
of fresh mounts and I've delivered them.

29:48.748 --> 29:51.967
Your contract calls for delivery
of saddle-broke horses.

29:52.001 --> 29:54.722
It ain't my fault he's
got to move out early.

29:54.754 --> 29:57.938
- If I could have one more day...
- You have your orders.

29:57.965 --> 30:00.521
- Yes, sir.
- Not with me he don't.

30:00.551 --> 30:01.682
Sir.

30:01.719 --> 30:04.690
You can have your money for
the 20 broken mustangs.

30:04.722 --> 30:08.108
But to get paid for the rest,
you'll have to go with McAllister.

30:08.142 --> 30:14.577
For every horse you break in on the way,
Colonel Foster will pay you in Concho.

30:14.607 --> 30:18.076
The men I hired to help catch
those mustangs are gone.

30:18.110 --> 30:21.045
The clothes I lived in for
four months I burned.

30:21.072 --> 30:26.213
And I didn't buy this new outfit to eat
no trail dust in. This is a swindle.

30:26.243 --> 30:29.297
- Be careful, Toller.
- You shut up, McAllister.

30:29.330 --> 30:31.469
You don't scare me none.

30:32.500 --> 30:36.847
- And you sure can't pull no rank on me.
- Toller, I'm sorry.

30:36.879 --> 30:41.191
- But that's the way it will have to be.
- Hurry it up, Toller.

30:41.217 --> 30:46.192
You might manage to break another
horse or two before dawn.

30:46.889 --> 30:50.654
You enjoy seeing me on a
horn, don't you, McAllister?

30:50.685 --> 30:53.110
You were a pretty
good sergeant once.

30:53.145 --> 30:57.373
But to me you're just another
money-hungry civilian.

30:57.400 --> 31:00.833
You used to be a pretty
good sergeant yourself.

31:00.861 --> 31:03.001
But now you're just a...

31:04.657 --> 31:06.796
a rank officer.

31:11.539 --> 31:13.678
I'll be back, Major.

31:25.761 --> 31:27.984
Company, attention!

31:28.723 --> 31:33.034
Line up in columns of two.
Dress right on the flag.

32:17.772 --> 32:19.911
Open her up.

32:34.997 --> 32:36.722
Whoa!

32:39.460 --> 32:42.347
- Grange?
- Yeah.

32:43.047 --> 32:48.023
You might not be able to get any kind
of an escort back here for weeks.

32:48.052 --> 32:49.350
So?

32:49.387 --> 32:53.899
It might not be too good an idea leaving
your wife here alone all that time.

32:53.933 --> 32:57.318
What makes it your business? Hm?

32:58.813 --> 33:03.575
It makes no difference. She stole two
horses and disappeared again last night.

33:03.609 --> 33:05.951
- Did you report it?
- No, why should I?

33:05.987 --> 33:09.705
They could have sent
somebody after her.

33:09.740 --> 33:15.179
If she wants to go, she can go.
Straight to hell, for all I care.

33:30.678 --> 33:33.150
Sergeant, mount up.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.854
Prepare to mount.

33:35.891 --> 33:37.616
Mount!

33:40.146 --> 33:44.991
Scotty, I'll be riding out on my own.
I'll pick you up in a couple of days.

33:45.026 --> 33:47.996
Remember, you're no use to
me hung up like Tom Van.

33:48.029 --> 33:52.458
Yes, Mother. I'll need a spare horse
in case I have to make some time.

33:52.491 --> 33:54.917
- Toller!
- I want a receipt.

34:10.426 --> 34:15.069
Drop that gauntlet, trooper.
Pull yourself up, lad.

34:16.389 --> 34:18.530
Look proud, all of you.

34:19.143 --> 34:21.614
- Move 'em out, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

34:21.646 --> 34:24.533
Lead off to the left,
a column of twos.

34:24.565 --> 34:27.036
Forward, ho!

34:32.447 --> 34:36.960
- Sergeant, present arms.
- Company, present arms.

35:00.601 --> 35:05.244
It is your doing Nachee is dead.
White-eyed trappers took him alive.

35:05.273 --> 35:08.658
They beat him to death with a whip.

35:11.654 --> 35:16.083
- I didn't want him dead.
- You white-eyes want us all dead.

35:16.117 --> 35:20.511
But when I die it will not be
as tame reservation Indian.

35:20.538 --> 35:23.923
I will die Apache,
killing my enemies.

35:25.459 --> 35:28.513
Alchise!

35:33.509 --> 35:36.444
Kaeta? Where is Kaeta?

36:02.330 --> 36:04.469
Kaeta.

36:39.617 --> 36:43.762
The boy is your son. You can
care for him while you live.

36:44.372 --> 36:47.508
Nachee's body lies in
Mogollon Mountains.

36:47.541 --> 36:51.057
You will live until we come there.

36:52.630 --> 36:55.897
- You're going to kill me?
- No.

36:55.925 --> 37:01.529
You will be alive when I bury
you in the grave of my son.

38:18.966 --> 38:20.560
Hold it!

38:22.511 --> 38:24.022
Come on!

38:38.361 --> 38:41.995
Sir, there's a rider
coming in from the south.

38:59.298 --> 39:02.150
Rub him down while he's feeding.

39:02.969 --> 39:06.484
- You've been pushing hard.
- I didn't want to come in after dark.

39:06.514 --> 39:11.406
One of your rookies might have
mistaken me for an Apache. Thank you.

39:11.435 --> 39:15.118
- Got anything for me?
- I got a good look at Chata.

39:15.147 --> 39:19.541
- You stretch your luck pretty thin.
- He's got about 45 armed men.

39:19.568 --> 39:23.084
He's on the move, his whole
camp. Women and kids.

39:23.114 --> 39:25.705
Including your wife, Grange.

39:25.741 --> 39:29.709
- Where's Chata headed?
- Mogollon Range'd be my hunch.

39:29.745 --> 39:34.092
He's got to set up a permanent camp
before he can put on any war paint.

39:34.125 --> 39:40.263
- If we could catch him by surprise...
- Scotty, he's got almost 50 fighting men.

39:40.298 --> 39:43.067
You got 29 including
me, Toller and Grange.

39:43.092 --> 39:48.483
We could hold Chata in place long enough
for reinforcements to arrive from Concho.

39:48.514 --> 39:51.615
Just hold on a minute, Lieutenant.

39:51.642 --> 39:56.903
- You ain't aiming to tangle with Chata?
- If you're going to eavesdrop, keep quiet.

39:56.939 --> 40:00.373
I put out a lot of money for that wagon.
I want to get it to Concho.

40:00.401 --> 40:06.255
If you're so anxious to get to Concho,
just hoist your butt on that wagon and go.

40:06.282 --> 40:08.837
What do you think I am, crazy?

40:10.661 --> 40:12.670
Corporal Harrington.

40:15.041 --> 40:18.592
- Are you busting with things to say, too?
- I don't like it either.

40:18.628 --> 40:22.677
But you're the cock-a-doodle-doo
here, so I'm stuck.

40:22.715 --> 40:25.104
Then?

40:25.134 --> 40:30.276
I just finished busting you
another gut-twister. Mark it.

40:31.182 --> 40:33.109
Yes, sir?

40:33.142 --> 40:37.703
You'll carry a dispatch to
Colonel Foster at Fort Concho.

40:37.730 --> 40:39.906
And don't stop on the way.

40:39.941 --> 40:43.908
- Not to eat, not to sleep. Understand?
- Yes, sir.

40:43.945 --> 40:47.544
Pick him out the two
fastest mounts we've got.

40:48.282 --> 40:55.512
And in future, when I'm having a private
conversation, keep the hell away from me.

40:55.539 --> 40:58.309
Like right now.

41:00.252 --> 41:04.350
Jess, get a meal under your belt,
then ride out and keep track of Chata.

41:04.382 --> 41:09.523
That'll leave you without a scout.
Chata could find you before I find him.

41:09.553 --> 41:13.947
I'll take care of myself.
You take care of yourself.

41:13.975 --> 41:17.906
There's a man in Concho I
gotta see before I die.

41:36.497 --> 41:38.637
- Grange.
- Yeah?

41:39.500 --> 41:42.471
If we should tangle with Chata...

41:43.879 --> 41:46.767
he'll have to leave his
families unguarded.

41:46.799 --> 41:51.727
There's a chance we could get
to your wife and get her out.

41:53.806 --> 41:56.777
Well, she's where she wants to be.

41:58.561 --> 42:01.068
So let her be.

42:51.030 --> 42:54.250
Mrs Grange! Ellen Grange!

43:26.607 --> 43:28.747
Mrs Grange!

43:35.408 --> 43:37.631
What the...?

44:03.102 --> 44:05.574
Get your pencil ready.

44:05.605 --> 44:07.993
- Are horses all you worry about?
- Yeah.

44:08.024 --> 44:10.579
I got ten more to bust
then my worries are over.

44:10.610 --> 44:15.917
- You could still lose your skin out here.
- Not if I can help it.

44:23.789 --> 44:30.391
Sir. There's fresh pony tracks leading
across our trail into that canyon.

44:30.421 --> 44:34.388
Well, soldier boy, you
found your Apaches.

44:34.425 --> 44:38.060
- Do we proceed, sir?
- We'll advance at the ready.

44:38.095 --> 44:40.437
Yes, sir.

44:41.140 --> 44:45.285
Toller. You remember
the Ojo Caliente fight.

44:45.311 --> 44:50.654
You got an arrow in your backside
and I pulled you to cover.

44:50.691 --> 44:54.374
- I remember.
- I have to lead the column.

44:55.029 --> 44:58.747
And somebody's got to find
out if Chata's up there.

45:00.159 --> 45:04.043
- And if I get killed you'll know.
- That's right.

45:05.623 --> 45:07.762
I see.

48:54.810 --> 48:57.828
Hold your fire. Reform in twos.

49:00.858 --> 49:03.627
Come on. You ain't paid for yet.

49:10.743 --> 49:13.381
Get those wagons to the rocks.

50:40.041 --> 50:43.806
Form a company front behind the
wagons. And do that about-turn.

50:43.836 --> 50:46.308
- Let's get you mounted.
- Leave me be.

50:46.339 --> 50:49.772
Don't give me no orders,
McAllister. Come on.

51:02.980 --> 51:06.698
O'Brien, company front
behind the wagons.

51:26.587 --> 51:28.727
About turn!

51:31.759 --> 51:33.022
Fire!

51:35.513 --> 51:37.901
About turn!

53:53.651 --> 53:55.625
Your leg's broke.

53:56.487 --> 53:58.627
I know.

54:10.167 --> 54:15.938
Sir, there's 16 dead. Some more men are
hurt so bad they can't be of much use.

54:15.965 --> 54:18.982
- And the cookwagon's lost.
- I know, Sergeant.

54:19.593 --> 54:22.445
- All our grub.
- The water. I know, Sergeant!

54:22.471 --> 54:27.399
- Chata's got us pinned down.
- As long as he keeps us pinned down

54:27.435 --> 54:31.663
till Colonel Foster shows up,
it'll have been worth it.

54:31.689 --> 54:34.706
- Won't it, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

54:35.818 --> 54:39.702
Tell the men that the water
they've got in their canteen

54:39.739 --> 54:44.417
will have to last them until
the reinforcements arrive.

54:44.452 --> 54:49.427
Any man who uses his up will just
have to drink his own sweat.

54:51.626 --> 54:53.802
- Yes, sir.
- And, Sergeant.

54:54.795 --> 54:58.229
- Fine job for your first Apache fight.
- Thank you, sir.

54:58.257 --> 55:04.146
Well, find shade for the wounded and see
that everything's done that can be done.

55:04.180 --> 55:06.189
Yes, sir.

55:06.849 --> 55:10.235
The worst casualty
is that cookwagon.

55:11.395 --> 55:15.659
Chata dealt the cards, played us
and took the first hand cold.

55:16.233 --> 55:19.287
I've still got an ace
card up my sleeve.

55:19.320 --> 55:21.828
- Harrington?
- Aye.

55:33.334 --> 55:36.103
Don't look. Look the other way.

55:39.090 --> 55:41.515
It's Corporal Harrington.

55:43.177 --> 55:45.151
Let's go.

56:04.949 --> 56:09.877
That's where Scotty is. We gotta get to
those rocks before Chata can cut us off.

56:09.912 --> 56:14.010
When I give you the word, get
going full out. I'll take the boy.

56:14.041 --> 56:18.684
You both got a better chance
of making it if I take him.

56:30.808 --> 56:32.901
What are you doing?

56:32.935 --> 56:36.535
Chata won't risk his men
shooting his own grandson.

56:39.567 --> 56:41.291
Now.

56:44.280 --> 56:46.503
Lieutenant. Look.

56:57.126 --> 56:59.551
Prepare to fire!

57:16.020 --> 57:17.365
Fire!

57:36.040 --> 57:38.809
Gimme here. You're scaring the kid.

57:53.557 --> 57:56.908
Gee-gee-gee-gee-gee.

57:56.936 --> 57:59.443
Whoo!

57:59.480 --> 58:03.079
You're standing up now.
Yes, you're standing up.

58:04.527 --> 58:07.711
What did you bring that here for?

58:08.489 --> 58:10.629
"That" is her son.

58:14.328 --> 58:16.136
Oh.

58:16.163 --> 58:19.514
Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to...

58:22.545 --> 58:25.848
Scotty, Harrington didn't make it.

58:28.551 --> 58:32.814
He was tortured before he died and
probably told Chata everything he knew.

58:32.847 --> 58:38.024
So Chata knows I'm waiting here for
reinforcements that won't arrive.

58:38.060 --> 58:42.822
He also knows what's in those wagons.
He wants that ammunition. And the glory.

58:42.857 --> 58:45.827
And he gets both by wiping us out.

58:45.860 --> 58:49.411
Which makes him bigger than
ever with the Apaches.

58:49.447 --> 58:51.171
Jess.

58:52.283 --> 58:55.300
We've got to break
out and find water.

58:55.328 --> 58:56.922
Where?

58:56.954 --> 58:59.806
There's only two places
between here and Concho.

58:59.832 --> 59:04.475
One of them's where Chata left his
families, 20 miles inside those hills.

59:04.503 --> 59:06.845
With those wagons you'll
never outrun him.

59:06.881 --> 59:10.184
- And the other place?
- Diablo Canyon.

59:10.217 --> 59:13.188
Just a half a mile from
where Chata's sitting.

59:13.220 --> 59:17.069
But Diablo is a box canyon.
There's only one way in.

59:17.099 --> 59:23.119
I spotted four or five Apaches there.
That's all he'll need to hold you up.

59:23.773 --> 59:28.285
Well, what's next... General?

59:37.453 --> 59:39.676
- How old is he, ma'am?
- Four months.

59:39.705 --> 59:43.589
He don't favour his
mother, that's for sure.

59:44.418 --> 59:46.558
Is that yours?

59:47.171 --> 59:50.142
- Yes.
- You didn't tell me that...

59:51.175 --> 59:54.359
- Why?
- After the way you acted?

59:55.805 --> 01:00:01.575
So you ran off the first chance you got to
get back to this... half-breed bastard.

01:00:01.602 --> 01:00:04.787
- Come off it, Grange.
- You stay out of this.

01:00:04.814 --> 01:00:09.540
- That's just a little baby.
- You keep your mouth shut!

01:00:16.409 --> 01:00:19.047
You were saying?

01:00:20.663 --> 01:00:23.301
Pick it up.

01:00:23.332 --> 01:00:26.267
- Be careful, Grange.
- I told you to pick it up.

01:00:30.172 --> 01:00:34.436
You got another one in your holster.
Use that one. Or backwater.

01:00:51.652 --> 01:00:58.633
You two can play games some other time.
Right now we can't spare either of you.

01:01:07.335 --> 01:01:11.728
You ought to play poker,
Grange. You got natural luck.

01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:27.494
Lieutenant McAllister would
like to see you two.

01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:31.951
Look. We set out at dark
with the wagons for Concho.

01:01:31.984 --> 01:01:34.310
Chata's not likely to follow us

01:01:34.336 --> 01:01:38.087
till he's sure we're not
feinting him out of the canyon.

01:01:38.115 --> 01:01:43.839
He'll just scout us, knowing he can
catch us easy enough when he's ready.

01:01:43.871 --> 01:01:48.432
After a couple of hours,
we'll shift direction.

01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:52.177
Strike straight for where
he's left his families.

01:01:52.213 --> 01:01:55.516
The scouts will race
back to report it.

01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:59.564
Chata will have to
come out to stop us.

01:01:59.595 --> 01:02:04.653
But by then, I'll have
changed direction again.

01:02:04.684 --> 01:02:08.864
Circling back to Diablo Canyon.

01:02:08.896 --> 01:02:13.741
Getting there before Chata
realises what's happened.

01:02:15.736 --> 01:02:18.506
You might make general one day.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:25.758
Except he'll probably leave some men in
the entrance to that canyon. Just in case.

01:02:25.788 --> 01:02:32.057
That's something you'll have to take
care of before you set out for Concho.

01:02:32.086 --> 01:02:35.472
You and the four best
men I've got left.

01:02:39.218 --> 01:02:43.067
- Toller?
- He's not under my orders.

01:02:44.765 --> 01:02:48.993
But I'm thirsty, too.
And I'm getting thirstier.

01:02:56.235 --> 01:02:58.909
Troopers, mount up.
We're moving out.

01:02:58.946 --> 01:03:01.086
Dress on the wagons.

01:03:09.373 --> 01:03:11.715
It's time now, Mrs Grange.

01:03:21.677 --> 01:03:24.019
- Help me mount.
- Are you sure you're able?

01:03:24.055 --> 01:03:27.440
- Sergeant, I give the orders.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:43.714
Here.

01:04:04.887 --> 01:04:06.861
Jess.

01:04:06.889 --> 01:04:12.446
As far as I'm concerned, the job's
done when you report to Concho.

01:04:12.478 --> 01:04:15.034
Clay Dean's there.

01:04:15.064 --> 01:04:19.244
I'll not take it bad if you don't
return with Colonel Foster.

01:04:19.277 --> 01:04:22.164
- Scotty.
- Aye?

01:04:22.196 --> 01:04:25.831
Keep an eye on Ellen
Grange and her boy.

01:04:29.412 --> 01:04:31.635
You've got no luck, Jess.

01:04:32.456 --> 01:04:34.596
She's already married.

01:05:22.506 --> 01:05:26.853
Welcome to your gory
bed - or to victory.

01:05:48.115 --> 01:05:54.929
Been over two hours. McAllister must
have made his first move by now.

01:06:13.766 --> 01:06:18.907
Now we start straight for
the hills. And Chata's families.

01:06:40.042 --> 01:06:42.812
It's a scout reporting
back to Chata.

01:07:12.867 --> 01:07:16.051
- How many?
- I couldn't count.

01:07:16.078 --> 01:07:19.678
They couldn't have
left too many behind.

01:07:56.994 --> 01:08:02.337
Turn back to the canyon. We've
got to get there by dawn.

01:08:02.375 --> 01:08:04.099
Now!

01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:21.171
It's almost dawn.

01:09:36.385 --> 01:09:39.688
If we keep on like this,
these animals will die.

01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:42.278
We'll all be dead if we don't.

01:10:50.501 --> 01:10:52.843
Move those wagons faster.

01:11:19.739 --> 01:11:22.080
Forward!

01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:40.019
Bugler, sound the charge.

01:12:16.796 --> 01:12:18.935
Make way for the wagons.

01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:15.988
Bugler, sound the charge.

01:13:38.044 --> 01:13:41.394
Swenson, sound the charge.

01:14:05.446 --> 01:14:08.630
Welcome to the water hole, General.

01:14:36.394 --> 01:14:40.112
- Where's Jess? Is he all right?
- He's on his way to Concho.

01:14:40.147 --> 01:14:45.040
Get the survivors back to the
water hole. Start with Mrs Grange.

01:14:45.069 --> 01:14:46.960
And Mrs Grange...

01:14:47.238 --> 01:14:49.663
you stay there.

01:14:51.867 --> 01:14:54.007
Did Jess get away?

01:14:55.913 --> 01:15:00.556
Yes, except two of Chata's outriders
followed him and got some shots at him.

01:15:00.584 --> 01:15:02.724
- Sergeant Ferguson.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:02.753 --> 01:15:07.432
Get the men lined up for inspection. Tell
Major Novac we're heading for Concho.

01:15:07.466 --> 01:15:11.185
- We only got just 11 men left.
- Get him back to the water hole.

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:14.819
Guard the entrance to
the canyon with...

01:15:16.058 --> 01:15:17.783
With...

01:15:18.561 --> 01:15:23.453
And position the two best marksmen
we've got left on top of the mesa.

01:15:23.482 --> 01:15:26.038
Try and get snipers up there.

01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:33.716
Mr Toller, I understand you fought
through a few of these Indian campaigns.

01:15:33.743 --> 01:15:37.627
- A few.
- Look, I'm a damn good sergeant, see?

01:15:39.248 --> 01:15:42.219
But I never fought
no Indians before.

01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:48.769
I never even been west of St Louis till
I brought out this bunch of recruits.

01:15:51.302 --> 01:15:54.853
Get those horses back to
the water. They earned it.

01:15:54.889 --> 01:15:58.155
And get one ammo wagon all
the way back to the water

01:15:58.184 --> 01:16:00.526
so we can use it for a last stand.

01:16:00.561 --> 01:16:03.697
Maybe we can hold out until
Colonel Foster gets here.

01:16:03.731 --> 01:16:08.659
- Suppose Remsberg gets caught.
- Remsberg ain't Harrington.

01:17:22.852 --> 01:17:26.237
I don't much like the idea of
blowing up all this ammunition.

01:17:26.272 --> 01:17:30.322
Let's hope we don't have to.
Casey! Nyles!

01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:34.209
Let's get you inside so you can
watch this whole rim up here.

01:17:34.238 --> 01:17:36.710
If I was Chata I'd call it quits.

01:17:38.951 --> 01:17:42.752
Anybody see where that come from?

01:17:43.205 --> 01:17:45.761
Scatter. We're too exposed.

01:17:53.215 --> 01:17:55.604
They're out of ammunition.

01:17:55.635 --> 01:18:01.488
Chata's taking no chances. A stray
bullet would hit that ammunition wagon.

01:21:05.074 --> 01:21:09.503
The lieutenant seems
to be resting easier.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.051
Fever's down. He'll be all right.

01:21:18.462 --> 01:21:22.975
You must love that kid an
awful lot to do what you did.

01:21:23.009 --> 01:21:25.148
He's my child.

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:32.573
I wish... that I'd
taken it different.

01:21:33.477 --> 01:21:38.738
I want you to know that, Ellen, because
we're not going to get out of here.

01:21:41.485 --> 01:21:43.625
Maybe if...

01:21:46.949 --> 01:21:51.960
Maybe if we'd had a kid, things
would have been different.

01:21:52.705 --> 01:21:57.716
You were a good husband, Will.
Before the Apaches took me.

01:21:57.752 --> 01:22:00.936
But you never would
have been again.

01:22:08.012 --> 01:22:09.736
Well...

01:22:23.069 --> 01:22:26.751
You'll need this when
they get in here at us.

01:22:27.615 --> 01:22:30.170
There's two cartridges in it.

01:23:34.515 --> 01:23:36.655
- Toller.
- Sergeant.

01:23:37.518 --> 01:23:42.861
- Sir. They're getting ready for something.
- Let's have a look.

01:23:47.111 --> 01:23:49.251
My wagon.

01:23:50.323 --> 01:23:53.708
They're using it for
cover. Sergeant!

01:24:02.418 --> 01:24:05.804
Hold your fire until you
see something to shoot at.

01:24:12.303 --> 01:24:14.146
Fire!

01:24:22.730 --> 01:24:27.658
Hold your fire until you can
see the legs of those ponies.

01:24:37.036 --> 01:24:39.709
Get ready to fire.

01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:46.728
Now.

01:24:56.764 --> 01:25:00.565
Casey, Nyles, cover us.
We're coming back.

01:25:04.188 --> 01:25:06.411
One got back inside here.

01:25:07.817 --> 01:25:09.909
Get going.

01:25:12.196 --> 01:25:14.336
Grange, get going.

01:25:22.331 --> 01:25:24.922
Get down.

01:26:02.913 --> 01:26:07.142
- Did you finish that big meal already?
- Colonel, is Clay Dean in town?

01:26:07.168 --> 01:26:09.307
The marshal? I suppose so.

01:26:09.337 --> 01:26:13.137
Unless he's off celebrating.
He killed a man last night.

01:26:13.174 --> 01:26:17.106
- We'll be ready to pull out in five minutes.
- I'll catch up with you.

01:26:17.136 --> 01:26:19.774
- Mount up.
- Prepare to mount.

01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:07.366
- We have to move back further.
- They'll all be slipping back in here now.

01:27:14.068 --> 01:27:16.540
We're pulling back. Get moving.

01:27:16.570 --> 01:27:18.710
Hold it.

01:27:20.491 --> 01:27:23.047
- Anybody seen Grange?
- Grange?

01:27:23.953 --> 01:27:26.092
Grange!

01:27:27.206 --> 01:27:29.097
Grange!

01:27:32.086 --> 01:27:34.226
Grange!

01:28:04.118 --> 01:28:06.258
Who's that?

01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:08.510
Jess Remsberg.

01:28:10.124 --> 01:28:12.762
Who the hell is Jess Remsberg?

01:28:13.711 --> 01:28:16.682
Scout for Colonel Foster's fort.

01:28:18.633 --> 01:28:20.772
All right.

01:28:26.641 --> 01:28:28.780
What do you want?

01:28:32.271 --> 01:28:35.242
- You Clay Dean?
- Yeah.

01:28:36.442 --> 01:28:38.700
I need some information.

01:28:38.736 --> 01:28:41.956
- It's important.
- Better be important to me.

01:29:02.385 --> 01:29:04.524
Well?

01:29:27.159 --> 01:29:29.299
Where'd you get that?

01:29:30.705 --> 01:29:34.138
- I won it in a poker game.
- Who did you win it from?

01:29:35.084 --> 01:29:37.058
- Why?
- Who?

01:29:37.712 --> 01:29:40.978
First you tell me why
you want to know.

01:29:44.093 --> 01:29:46.980
- She was my wife.
- Oh.

01:29:49.015 --> 01:29:55.069
So that's it, huh? No, you're not
going to find out about him from me.

01:29:55.104 --> 01:29:57.612
I might tell him about you, though.

01:29:57.648 --> 01:30:00.073
He did you a favour, mister.

01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:06.078
I ain't got nothing against a man bedding
down with a pretty young Indian girl.

01:30:06.115 --> 01:30:09.418
- But calling her your wife...
- Tell me who you won it from.

01:30:13.414 --> 01:30:17.843
You can leave here now, squaw man.
And leave your gunbelt.

01:30:20.755 --> 01:30:22.894
Take off the gun.

01:30:26.135 --> 01:30:28.275
Or use it.

01:30:58.417 --> 01:31:00.759
Now tell me who you
won her hair from.

01:31:00.795 --> 01:31:04.014
- If I do?
- If you do, you go on living.

01:31:04.048 --> 01:31:07.065
You got yourself a name
as a bad man with a gun.

01:31:07.093 --> 01:31:12.318
Maybe you're thinking you can tell me
any name and later come gunning for me.

01:31:12.348 --> 01:31:14.487
No, I...

01:31:17.645 --> 01:31:21.529
Well, now you know.
You're not fast any more.

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:28.374
You give me the wrong name and
I'll come back and finish the job.

01:31:33.494 --> 01:31:35.752
Now, who?

01:31:35.788 --> 01:31:38.213
He needed $10 to see my hand.

01:31:38.958 --> 01:31:41.845
Grange put up the scalp for it.
He was drunk and...

01:31:41.877 --> 01:31:46.438
- Who did you say?
- Grange. A freighter. Will Grange.

01:31:46.465 --> 01:31:50.968
He was telling how he'd revenged his
wife on this Comanche girl he'd caught.

01:32:10.573 --> 01:32:14.540
They're inside the perimeter.
Get against the walls.

01:32:23.127 --> 01:32:25.267
- Get back.
- He's alive.

01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:51.295
Will!

01:32:57.662 --> 01:33:00.513
- They're killing him.
- Not yet.

01:33:02.249 --> 01:33:04.389
It's an old trick.

01:33:05.544 --> 01:33:09.974
They saved him for this.
To work on our nerves.

01:33:11.884 --> 01:33:14.440
Oh, God.

01:33:34.532 --> 01:33:39.092
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

01:33:40.079 --> 01:33:42.848
now and in the hour of our death.

01:33:47.545 --> 01:33:53.648
Ferguson, it is time to collect that dry
brush and get it under that ammo wagon.

01:33:53.676 --> 01:33:57.560
If they rush us, that
wagon better burn fast.

01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:43.029
Mrs Grange.

01:34:44.185 --> 01:34:48.532
Somebody's got to kill him. Put
an end to what they're doing.

01:34:51.192 --> 01:34:53.331
Mrs Grange...

01:35:02.495 --> 01:35:05.050
Give me your gun and get down.

01:35:24.392 --> 01:35:26.116
No.

01:35:39.073 --> 01:35:44.464
All up to you now, Toller. Don't
let them get the ammunition.

01:35:45.079 --> 01:35:49.722
Chata won't get that ammunition.
Even if he wipes us out.

01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:53.219
And he's lost too many men
against a force half his size.

01:35:53.254 --> 01:35:55.975
- You did it.
- No.

01:35:57.842 --> 01:36:02.105
- I killed most of my men.
- Chata had to be stopped and you did it.

01:36:02.138 --> 01:36:06.070
That's what the army's out
here to do, ain't it?

01:36:06.726 --> 01:36:08.544
Is it?

01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:11.400
Yes.

01:36:12.106 --> 01:36:13.831
Yes.

01:36:22.033 --> 01:36:24.042
Toller.

01:36:24.744 --> 01:36:26.468
You...

01:36:27.955 --> 01:36:30.095
You tell them that...

01:37:15.252 --> 01:37:20.892
- You're sure this is what you want to do?
- I don't want him to die.

01:37:20.925 --> 01:37:25.486
- Chata will take care of him.
- He'll raise him as an Apache.

01:37:26.597 --> 01:37:31.026
My people would never raise
him as one of their own.

01:37:37.942 --> 01:37:43.333
They're getting ready for the kill.
We'd better get back to that wagon.

01:37:43.364 --> 01:37:45.503
Now, Mrs Grange.

01:37:51.247 --> 01:37:53.386
Mrs Grange, now.

01:38:17.231 --> 01:38:19.371
They're coming. All of them.

01:38:43.215 --> 01:38:46.269
If they get me, you
fire this wagon.

01:40:09.135 --> 01:40:11.523
Company, halt.

01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:48.520
Ellen!

01:40:59.143 --> 01:41:01.117
- Ellen.
- Let me go to Will.

01:41:01.771 --> 01:41:04.788
- Where is he?
- Let me go to him, please.

01:41:04.815 --> 01:41:07.371
You stay here. I'll find him.

01:41:43.938 --> 01:41:46.196
Kill me.

01:41:46.774 --> 01:41:49.792
Help. Please.

01:41:50.444 --> 01:41:53.118
Please. Kill me.

01:41:54.365 --> 01:41:58.794
Now. Please. Kill me.

01:41:59.954 --> 01:42:01.678
Help.

01:42:48.377 --> 01:42:53.186
I wonder if they'll stay on
the reservation this time.

01:42:53.215 --> 01:42:55.355
Why should they?

01:43:10.441 --> 01:43:14.835
Company, forward. Turn, ho!

01:43:22.995 --> 01:43:25.503
Forward, ho!

01:43:53.901 --> 01:43:56.041
General.

01:44:32.481 --> 01:44:34.621
