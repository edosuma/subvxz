02:07.612 --> 02:08.777
Still got it.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.767
What's that?

04:43.851 --> 04:45.602
An old friend.

04:47.271 --> 04:49.356
I was rummaging
through a closet

04:49.440 --> 04:51.441
and it was just
sitting there.

04:51.525 --> 04:55.362
It's nice, Paul.
It's got character.

04:55.446 --> 04:57.822
When I wrote my first book, I
used to carry it around in this

04:57.907 --> 05:00.033
while I was looking
for a publisher.

05:00.117 --> 05:01.326
I was a writer then.

05:01.410 --> 05:02.702
You're still a writer.

05:03.412 --> 05:06.289
Haven't been a writer since I
got in the Misery business.

05:06.374 --> 05:10.919
It's not a bad business. And it
would still be growing, too.

05:11.003 --> 05:12.879
The first printing
for Misery's Child

05:12.963 --> 05:15.715
was the most ever.
Over a million.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.884
Marcia, please.

05:17.968 --> 05:20.387
Misery Chastain put braces
on your daughter's teeth

05:20.471 --> 05:21.888
and is putting her
through college,

05:21.972 --> 05:24.307
bought you two houses and
floor seats to the Knicks.

05:24.392 --> 05:27.227
And what thanks does she get?
You go and kill her!

05:27.311 --> 05:30.438
I never meant for it
to become my life.

05:30.523 --> 05:32.565
And if I hadn't
gotten rid of her now,

05:32.650 --> 05:34.859
I'd have ended up
writing her forever.

05:34.944 --> 05:39.114
Now I'm leaving for Colorado
to try to finish the new book.

05:39.198 --> 05:44.202
If I can make this work, I might just
have something I want on my tombstone.

07:04.950 --> 07:07.827
I'm your
number-one fan.

07:07.912 --> 07:10.663
There's nothing
to worry about.

07:10.748 --> 07:15.335
You're gonna be just fine.
I'll take good care of you.

07:16.420 --> 07:18.505
I'm your number-one fan.

07:28.390 --> 07:29.641
Where...

07:31.352 --> 07:33.436
We're just outside
Silver Creek.

07:36.065 --> 07:37.440
How long?

07:37.942 --> 07:41.778
You've been here two days.
You're gonna be okay.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.822
My name is Annie Wilkes.

07:44.907 --> 07:46.491
My number-one fan.

07:47.743 --> 07:51.287
Yes. That's right.
I'm also a nurse.

07:53.999 --> 07:56.125
Here, take these.

08:27.324 --> 08:28.658
Here.

08:30.327 --> 08:32.287
- What are they?
- They're called Novril.

08:32.371 --> 08:34.080
They're for your pain.

08:46.135 --> 08:47.594
Thank you.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.353
How come I'm not
in a hospital?

08:57.438 --> 09:00.940
The blizzard was too strong. I
couldn't risk trying to get you there.

09:01.025 --> 09:04.193
I tried calling, but the
phone lines are down.

09:05.696 --> 09:09.365
You mustn't tire yourself.
You've gotta rest.

09:10.451 --> 09:12.368
You almost died.

09:24.089 --> 09:25.673
Open wide.

09:31.388 --> 09:34.474
Your legs just sing grand opera
when you move, don't they?

09:35.643 --> 09:38.311
It's not gonna hurt forever,
Paul, I promise you.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.689
Will I be able to walk?

09:41.774 --> 09:42.857
Of course you will.

09:42.941 --> 09:45.485
And your arm
will be fine, too.

09:45.569 --> 09:47.820
Your shoulder was
pretty badly dislocated.

09:47.905 --> 09:51.115
It was a little stubborn, but
I finally popped it back in.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.035
What I'm most proud of is the
work I did on those legs.

09:54.119 --> 09:55.620
Considering what
I had around the house,

09:55.704 --> 09:58.706
I don't think there's a doctor
who could've done any better.

10:02.753 --> 10:05.046
It's not nearly
as bad as it looks.

10:05.130 --> 10:08.341
You have a compound fracture
of the tibia in both legs,

10:08.425 --> 10:11.344
and the fibula in the right
leg is fractured, too.

10:11.428 --> 10:12.679
I could hear
the bones moving,

10:12.763 --> 10:16.307
so it's best for your legs
to remain immobile.

10:16.392 --> 10:18.184
And as soon as
the roads open,

10:18.268 --> 10:20.353
I'll take you to a hospital.

10:20.437 --> 10:23.481
Meantime, you've got
a lot of recovering to do,

10:23.565 --> 10:27.193
and I consider it an honor
that you'll do it in my home.

10:35.077 --> 10:37.870
This is Marcia Sindell, I'm
calling from New York City.

10:37.955 --> 10:40.998
I'd like to speak to the Silver
Creek Chief of Police or Sheriff.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.250
Which one
of them do you want?

10:42.334 --> 10:43.710
Whichever one's not busy.

10:43.794 --> 10:46.713
Well, I'm pretty sure they're
both not busy, Miss Sindell,

10:46.797 --> 10:48.631
since they're both me.

10:48.716 --> 10:53.302
I also happen to be president of the
Policeman's Benefit Association,

10:53.387 --> 10:55.555
chairman of the Patrolman's
Retirement Fund,

10:55.639 --> 10:59.684
and if you need a good fishing
guide, you could do a lot worse.

10:59.768 --> 11:02.228
Call me Buster.
Everybody does.

11:02.312 --> 11:04.021
What can I do for you?

11:04.106 --> 11:07.734
I'm a literary agent, and I... I
feel like a fool calling you,

11:07.818 --> 11:11.571
but I think one of my
clients, Paul Sheldon,

11:11.655 --> 11:13.364
might be in some
kind of trouble.

11:14.158 --> 11:16.200
You mean Paul Sheldon
the writer?

11:17.035 --> 11:18.327
He's your client, huh?

11:18.412 --> 11:19.620
Yes, he is.

11:19.705 --> 11:22.582
Everybody sure likes
those Misery books.

11:22.666 --> 11:26.919
I'm sure you know that Paul's been
coming to the Silver Creek Lodge

11:27.004 --> 11:28.838
for years
to finish his books.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.758
I understand he's been up
here the last six weeks.

11:31.842 --> 11:34.761
Well, not quite.
I just called there

11:34.845 --> 11:39.307
and they said he checked
out last Tuesday.

11:39.391 --> 11:40.767
Isn't that
a little strange?

11:40.851 --> 11:42.810
I don't know.
Does he usually phone you

11:42.895 --> 11:44.854
before he checks
out of a hotel?

11:45.647 --> 11:50.109
No, of course not. It's just that
his daughter hasn't heard from him,

11:50.194 --> 11:54.238
and when he has a new book coming
out, he usually keeps in touch.

11:54.323 --> 11:56.949
Now when there wasn't
any word from him, I...

11:57.034 --> 11:59.076
You think he might
be missin', huh?

12:00.370 --> 12:04.248
I hate that I made this call.
Tell me I'm being silly.

12:04.333 --> 12:09.796
A little overprotective, maybe,
but tell you what I'll do.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.756
Nothing's been
reported out here,

12:11.840 --> 12:14.675
but I'll put his name
through our system, and

12:16.094 --> 12:19.138
if anything turns up,
I'll call you right back.

12:19.223 --> 12:21.599
I'd appreciate that.
Thanks a lot.

12:21.683 --> 12:23.851
Goodbye, Miss Sindell.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.647
We got a phone call?
Busy morning.

12:27.731 --> 12:30.066
Yeah. Work, work, work.

12:30.859 --> 12:33.820
Virginia,
when was that blizzard?

12:33.904 --> 12:36.364
Last Tuesday. Why?

12:37.407 --> 12:38.866
No reason.

12:49.461 --> 12:52.255
I guess it was kind of a
miracle, you finding me.

12:53.674 --> 12:56.008
No, it wasn't
a miracle at all.

12:56.677 --> 12:59.220
In a way,
I was following you.

12:59.304 --> 13:00.429
You were following me?

13:00.514 --> 13:03.850
Well, it wasn't any secret to me you
were staying at the Silver Creek,

13:03.934 --> 13:06.727
seeing as how I'm your
number-one fan and all.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.439
Some nights I'd just tool on
down there and sit outside

13:10.524 --> 13:14.026
and look up at
the light in your cabin

13:14.111 --> 13:16.070
and I'd try to imagine what
was goin' on in the room

13:16.154 --> 13:17.572
of the world's
greatest writer.

13:17.656 --> 13:19.657
Say the last part again,
I didn't hear you.

13:19.741 --> 13:21.200
Don't move now.

13:21.285 --> 13:23.870
I wouldn't want
to hurt this neck.

13:24.955 --> 13:29.292
Well, the other afternoon
I was on my way home,

13:29.376 --> 13:32.378
and there you were,
leavin' the lodge.

13:32.462 --> 13:35.256
And I wondered why a literary
genius would go for a drive

13:35.340 --> 13:37.216
when there was
a big storm comin'.

13:37.301 --> 13:39.844
I didn't know there was
a big storm coming.

13:39.928 --> 13:43.723
Well, lucky for you, I did.
And lucky for me, too,

13:43.807 --> 13:47.435
'cause now you're alive and
you can write more books.

13:48.478 --> 13:50.938
Oh, Paul, I've read
everything of yours.

13:51.023 --> 13:53.733
The Misery novels.
I know 'em all by heart.

13:53.817 --> 13:57.278
All eight of 'em.
I love them so.

13:57.362 --> 13:58.905
Well, you're very kind.

13:58.989 --> 14:00.740
And you're very brilliant.

14:02.451 --> 14:05.453
Like a baby. All done.

14:05.537 --> 14:07.580
Thank you.

14:07.664 --> 14:11.167
When do you think the phone lines'll be up?
I have to call my daughter,

14:11.251 --> 14:12.835
and I'd like to call
my agent in New York

14:12.920 --> 14:14.712
and let her know
I'm still breathing.

14:14.796 --> 14:16.631
It shouldn't be
too much longer now.

14:16.715 --> 14:19.926
Once the roads are open, the
phone lines'll be up in no time.

14:20.010 --> 14:22.261
If you give me their numbers,
I'll keep tryin' them for you.

14:22.346 --> 14:24.347
Thank you.

14:25.515 --> 14:27.558
Could I ask you a favor?

14:30.062 --> 14:34.690
I noticed in your case there's
a new Paul Sheldon book, and

14:34.775 --> 14:36.776
I wondered if maybe...

14:36.860 --> 14:38.527
You want to read it?

14:38.612 --> 14:40.404
Well, if you wouldn't mind.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.658
Well, I do have a very
hard-and-fast rule as to

14:43.742 --> 14:45.868
who reads my stuff
at this early stage.

14:46.787 --> 14:49.121
Only my editor, my agent,

14:49.206 --> 14:53.167
and anybody that saves me from
freezing to death in a car wreck.

15:00.384 --> 15:03.886
You'll never realize what a
rare treat you've given me.

15:06.348 --> 15:10.309
Boy, it's like clockwork
the way your pain comes.

15:10.394 --> 15:11.852
I'll get you
your Novril, Paul.

15:11.937 --> 15:15.314
Forgive me for prattling away
and making you feel all oogy.

15:20.070 --> 15:22.738
What's your
new book called?

15:22.823 --> 15:25.032
I don't have a title yet.

15:25.117 --> 15:27.159
What's it about?

15:27.911 --> 15:29.662
I don't know.

15:29.746 --> 15:32.832
I know it sounds crazy, but
I haven't written anything

15:32.916 --> 15:34.959
but Misery for so long.

15:35.043 --> 15:38.337
Why don't you read it,
and you can tell me

15:38.422 --> 15:39.714
what you think it's about?

15:39.798 --> 15:41.882
Maybe you can
come up with a title.

15:42.968 --> 15:44.760
Like I could do that!

15:47.931 --> 15:51.308
There's nothin' unusual about
Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster.

15:51.393 --> 15:53.185
You can tell
by the champagne.

15:53.270 --> 15:54.520
Maybe you can, Libby.

15:54.604 --> 15:57.398
No, see, he always orders
a bottle of Dom PÃ©rignon

15:57.482 --> 15:58.816
when he's ready to go.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.027
Then he pays up
and he's out the door.

16:01.111 --> 16:05.406
No long-distance phone calls
or Federal Express packages?

16:05.490 --> 16:07.700
Anything out
of the ordinary?

16:08.160 --> 16:09.702
I don't think
Mr. Sheldon likes

16:09.786 --> 16:12.246
for things to be
out of the ordinary.

16:12.330 --> 16:15.958
Considering who he is
and all, famous and all,

16:16.043 --> 16:18.794
he doesn't put on airs.

16:18.879 --> 16:24.216
Drives up from New York in the
same car each time, a '65 Mustang.

16:24.301 --> 16:26.302
He says it helps him
to think.

16:27.512 --> 16:29.180
He's always
been a good guest.

16:29.264 --> 16:31.932
Never makes a noise,
never bothers a soul.

16:32.642 --> 16:34.602
I sure hope nothing's
happened to him.

16:34.686 --> 16:35.895
So do I.

16:36.438 --> 16:40.107
I bet that old Mustang is pulling
into New York right now.

16:41.193 --> 16:43.486
I'm sure you're right.
Thanks, Libby.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.029
My pleasure.

16:58.835 --> 17:02.546
I know I'm only 40 pages
into your book, but...

17:04.340 --> 17:06.342
But what?

17:07.551 --> 17:09.970
Nothing.

17:10.055 --> 17:12.306
What is it?

17:12.390 --> 17:14.183
Well, it's ridiculous.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.810
Who am I to make a criticism
to someone like you?

17:16.895 --> 17:19.230
It's all right,
I can take it.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.901
Well, it's
brilliantly written.

17:23.984 --> 17:26.569
But then everything
you write is brilliant.

17:26.655 --> 17:28.614
Pretty rough so far?

17:30.367 --> 17:32.284
The swearing, Paul.

17:34.371 --> 17:36.205
There, I said it.

17:37.082 --> 17:39.834
The... The profanity
bothers you?

17:40.043 --> 17:42.336
It has no nobility.

17:42.420 --> 17:46.841
These are slum kids.
I was a slum kid.

17:46.925 --> 17:48.342
Everybody talks like that.

17:48.426 --> 17:50.594
They do not!

17:50.679 --> 17:52.972
What do you think I say when I
go to the feed store in town?

17:53.056 --> 17:56.600
"Now, Wally, give me a bag
of that F-ing pig feed

17:56.685 --> 17:59.395
"and 10 pounds of that
bitchly cow corn"?

17:59.479 --> 18:02.314
And in the bank,
do I tell Mrs. Bollinger,

18:02.399 --> 18:04.233
"Here's one big bastard
of a check,

18:04.317 --> 18:06.318
"give me some of your
Christing money"?

18:06.403 --> 18:09.822
There! Look there!
See what you made me do?

18:14.703 --> 18:17.204
Paul, I'm sorry.

18:17.289 --> 18:18.914
I'm so sorry.

18:24.212 --> 18:28.632
Sometimes I get so worked up.
Can you ever forgive me?

18:30.260 --> 18:32.136
It's fine.

18:38.101 --> 18:40.102
I love you, Paul.

18:43.773 --> 18:48.027
Your mind. Your creativity.
That's all I meant.

19:28.610 --> 19:30.569
Well, this sure is fun.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.166
Virginia, when
you're in this car

19:44.251 --> 19:46.085
you're not my wife,
you're my deputy.

19:48.171 --> 19:49.630
Well, this deputy'd
rather be home

19:49.714 --> 19:52.466
under the covers
with the sheriff.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.345
- Stop. Stop.
- What? What?

20:07.440 --> 20:10.276
See that broken limb?

20:10.360 --> 20:12.027
Could've been
the weight of the snow.

20:12.112 --> 20:15.447
Yeah? Could've been a rotten
branch, could've been the wind,

20:15.532 --> 20:17.825
could've been
a lot of things.

20:50.525 --> 20:51.567
Damn!

20:52.569 --> 20:54.611
Need some help?

20:55.322 --> 20:58.615
No, I'm enjoyin' myself!
Thank you.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.348
You really think
Sheldon's out there?

21:22.432 --> 21:25.309
I hope not.
If he is, he's dead.

21:26.478 --> 21:28.937
Let's go to
the newspaper office.

22:01.388 --> 22:03.931
I hope I didn't wake you.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.767
No, that's fine.

22:08.520 --> 22:12.481
Look what I got. They had
it at the store, Paul.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.066
There was a whole batch
of 'em there,

22:14.150 --> 22:17.653
and as soon as I saw it I slammed my
money down. I got the first copy.

22:18.571 --> 22:19.863
Then the roads are open.

22:19.948 --> 22:22.408
Well, the one to town is,
but that's about it.

22:22.492 --> 22:26.412
I called the hospital and I talked
to the head orthopedic surgeon

22:26.496 --> 22:29.581
and I told him who you were
and what had happened.

22:29.666 --> 22:34.336
He said as long as there's no
infection you're not in any danger,

22:34.421 --> 22:36.505
and as soon as the road
to the hospital is open,

22:36.589 --> 22:39.049
they'll send
an ambulance for you.

22:39.134 --> 22:41.343
The phone's working?

22:42.220 --> 22:46.098
Well, mine's still out, but the ones
in town were working just fine.

22:46.182 --> 22:47.933
I called that
agent of yours.

22:48.017 --> 22:51.228
Paul, I peeked at
the very beginning.

22:51.312 --> 22:53.355
What a wonderful
first page.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.773
Just to read the name
Misery Chastain...

22:54.858 --> 22:56.191
My daughter's gotta
be goin' nuts.

22:56.276 --> 22:58.444
It's like a visit from my
oldest, dearest friend.

22:58.528 --> 23:02.781
I mean, I'm supposed to be home
for her birthday. It's today.

23:03.533 --> 23:05.409
The agent said she would
tell her you were okay,

23:05.493 --> 23:07.161
but I'm afraid you'll have
to wait till tomorrow

23:07.245 --> 23:09.872
if you want to talk
to her yourself.

23:12.876 --> 23:16.545
Oh, Paul.
What a poet you are.

23:25.847 --> 23:29.892
I made you my specialty,
scrambled eggs Ã  la Wilkes.

23:30.393 --> 23:32.227
And I'm on Page 75.

23:33.563 --> 23:35.981
I guess that means
it's okay.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.066
No.

23:38.568 --> 23:40.486
No, it isn't, it's...

23:41.154 --> 23:44.698
Pooh. I can't think
of any words.

23:44.782 --> 23:46.241
Would "great" be insulting?

23:47.744 --> 23:49.786
I can live with great.

23:50.163 --> 23:54.249
No. It's not just great,
it's

23:56.419 --> 23:57.419
perfect.

23:59.756 --> 24:01.840
A perfect, perfect thing.

24:48.930 --> 24:51.807
I thought it was time
you two should meet.

24:52.642 --> 24:56.019
Paul, say hello to my favorite
beast in the whole world,

24:56.104 --> 24:57.771
my sow Misery.

24:59.566 --> 25:00.566
Misery?

25:00.650 --> 25:03.318
Yes. I told you I was
your number-one fan.

25:03.778 --> 25:07.030
Yeah, I'm... I'm
starting to believe you.

25:07.115 --> 25:08.448
This farm was
kind of dreary,

25:08.533 --> 25:10.742
what with just a few cows
and chickens and me.

25:10.827 --> 25:14.288
But when I got Misery
here, everything changed.

25:14.372 --> 25:16.206
She just makes me smile so.

25:16.708 --> 25:20.627
She's a fine pig,
is what she is.

25:23.506 --> 25:29.428
I'm on Page 300 now, Paul, and it's
better than perfect. It's divine.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.848
What's the ceiling
that dago painted?

25:33.933 --> 25:35.684
The Sistine Chapel?

25:35.768 --> 25:38.770
Yeah!
That and Misery's Child.

25:38.855 --> 25:42.441
Those are the only two divine
things ever in this world!

26:00.752 --> 26:03.670
When my husband left me,
I wasn't prepared.

26:05.048 --> 26:07.215
It wasn't an easy time.

26:08.926 --> 26:11.928
For a while I thought
I might go crazy.

26:13.056 --> 26:15.474
I know how that can be.

26:17.602 --> 26:20.562
I don't know about you, but
what I did to get through it

26:20.647 --> 26:22.272
was I dove into work.

26:23.107 --> 26:25.400
Days, nights.

26:26.903 --> 26:30.447
Night shifts can be lonely
at a hospital.

26:30.531 --> 26:31.740
I did a lot of reading.

26:33.660 --> 26:36.495
That was when I first
discovered Misery.

26:37.246 --> 26:42.250
She made me so happy. She made
me forget all my problems.

26:43.920 --> 26:47.506
Course, I suppose you had a little
something to do with that, too.

26:47.590 --> 26:49.591
Yeah, well...

26:52.720 --> 26:55.847
I just kept reading
them over and over.

26:55.932 --> 26:57.808
I've only got two chapters
to go on this one,

26:57.892 --> 27:00.477
and I know when I finish I'll
just turn right to the first page

27:00.561 --> 27:03.271
and start reading it
all over again.

27:04.273 --> 27:05.691
I'm...

27:09.195 --> 27:10.987
- Done?
- Yeah.

27:11.072 --> 27:12.447
No problem.

27:14.617 --> 27:16.201
Thanks.

27:16.285 --> 27:19.705
Don't get me wrong. I'm not
against marriage per se,

27:19.789 --> 27:22.249
but it'd take a pretty
special guy to make me

27:22.333 --> 27:24.793
want to walk down
that aisle again.

27:24.877 --> 27:28.380
Yeah, it's not something you
should enter into lightly.

27:28.464 --> 27:30.882
It boils down to respect.

27:30.967 --> 27:34.219
People just don't respect the
institution of marriage anymore.

27:34.303 --> 27:36.972
They have no sense
of real commitment.

27:39.767 --> 27:42.102
Well, I'd love to
stay here and chat,

27:42.186 --> 27:45.981
but I'm right at the end, and I
gotta find out what happens.

28:07.670 --> 28:09.087
You...

28:12.008 --> 28:16.094
You dirty bird.
How could you?

28:17.680 --> 28:23.310
She can't be dead! Misery
Chastain cannot be dead!

28:23.936 --> 28:27.063
Annie, in 1871, women
often died in childbirth.

28:28.149 --> 28:29.524
But her spirit
is the important thing,

28:29.609 --> 28:31.526
and Misery's spirit
is still alive.

28:31.611 --> 28:35.280
I don't want her spirit!
I want her!

28:35.364 --> 28:37.491
And you murdered her!

28:37.575 --> 28:40.160
No. I didn't.

28:40.244 --> 28:41.828
Who did?

28:41.913 --> 28:46.082
No one. She died,
she just slipped away.

28:46.167 --> 28:50.170
Slipped away? Slipped away?

28:50.254 --> 28:53.006
She didn't just slip away!
You did it!

28:55.092 --> 28:57.302
You did it! You did it!

28:57.386 --> 29:01.473
You did it! You did it!
You murdered my Misery!

29:01.557 --> 29:02.557
Annie!

29:07.563 --> 29:10.232
I thought
you were good, Paul.

29:10.316 --> 29:14.903
But you're not good. You're just
another lying old dirty birdie.

29:15.571 --> 29:18.990
And I don't think I better
be around you for a while.

29:27.750 --> 29:30.752
And don't even think about
anybody coming for you.

29:30.837 --> 29:35.799
Not the doctors, not your
agent, not your family,

29:35.883 --> 29:37.342
because I never called them.

29:38.261 --> 29:40.679
Nobody knows you're here.

29:40.763 --> 29:43.682
And you better hope
nothing happens to me.

29:44.433 --> 29:47.519
Because if I die,
you die.

32:16.252 --> 32:20.296
No, Miss Sindell, there's
no point in comin' up here now.

32:20.381 --> 32:22.799
Everything that
can be done is.

32:24.093 --> 32:26.511
Yes, we're working close
with the state police

32:26.595 --> 32:28.888
and the FBI's
been informed.

32:28.973 --> 32:33.727
Right. Right. As soon as we know
anything, we'll let you know.

32:34.270 --> 32:38.440
No bother at all. Call anytime.
Bye, Miss Sindell.

32:39.734 --> 32:43.236
All right. Well, I sure
appreciate it. Thank you.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.991
According to the check on
Sheldon's credit charges,

32:48.075 --> 32:50.285
there's nothing
after the Silver Creek.

32:50.995 --> 32:53.705
And no calls about
the article, either.

32:56.751 --> 33:01.337
You poor, dear thing. What
are you doing on the floor?

33:02.548 --> 33:04.674
It's all my fault.

33:04.759 --> 33:08.470
If I'd had a proper hospital bed
this never would've happened.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.889
Here, let me
help you back in.

33:13.893 --> 33:17.812
I know this hurts, but it'll
only take a few seconds.

33:18.481 --> 33:21.399
Upsy-daisy!

33:26.822 --> 33:28.198
Please, wait.

33:28.282 --> 33:29.991
You're such a crybaby.

33:37.541 --> 33:40.043
There you go. Comfy?

33:40.628 --> 33:41.753
Perfect.

33:41.837 --> 33:44.047
You're such a kidder.

33:44.131 --> 33:46.382
I have a big surprise
for you.

33:46.467 --> 33:48.927
But first there's
something you must do.

33:49.345 --> 33:52.138
You don't suppose
I could have a little snack

33:52.223 --> 33:54.182
while I'm waiting
for the surprise?

33:54.266 --> 33:57.811
I'll get you everything you want,
but you must listen first.

33:58.687 --> 34:02.398
Sometimes my thinking is a
little muddy, I accept that.

34:02.483 --> 34:03.483
That's why
I couldn't remember

34:03.567 --> 34:04.984
all the things
they were asking me

34:05.069 --> 34:07.403
on the witness stand
in Denver.

34:08.072 --> 34:09.906
But this time
I thought clearly.

34:10.533 --> 34:12.283
I asked God about you,

34:12.368 --> 34:14.077
and God said,
"I delivered him unto you

34:14.161 --> 34:16.454
"so that you may
show him the way."

34:16.871 --> 34:18.790
Show me the way?

34:18.873 --> 34:20.041
Yes.

34:53.449 --> 34:54.534
When I mentioned a snack,

34:54.618 --> 34:56.161
I was thinking
more along the lines

34:56.245 --> 34:59.080
of cheese and crackers
kind of thing.

34:59.165 --> 35:02.542
Paul, this is
no time for jokes.

35:02.626 --> 35:05.253
You must rid the world
of this filth.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.883
You want me to burn my book?

35:09.967 --> 35:13.928
I know this may be difficult for
you, but it's for the best.

35:17.183 --> 35:20.059
It's really
not difficult at all.

35:20.144 --> 35:21.644
My agent made
dozens of copies.

35:21.729 --> 35:23.980
There's gonna be
an auction in New York.

35:24.064 --> 35:26.608
Every publishing house in
New York is reading it now.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.985
So if you want me
to burn my book, fine.

35:29.069 --> 35:31.946
You're not really ridding
the world of anything.

35:32.656 --> 35:34.574
Then light the match, Paul.

35:35.075 --> 35:37.202
It's no big deal.

35:37.286 --> 35:40.580
So you've indicated. Do it.

35:50.299 --> 35:52.175
I know this is
the only copy, Paul.

35:52.259 --> 35:54.636
When you were 24 you wrote your first
book, and you didn't make a copy

35:54.720 --> 35:57.096
because you didn't think anybody
would take it seriously.

35:57.181 --> 35:59.432
But they did. And ever since
you've never made any copies

35:59.516 --> 36:00.892
because you're
superstitious.

36:00.976 --> 36:03.228
It's why you always come back
to the Silver Creek Lodge.

36:03.312 --> 36:06.481
You told that story to Merv
Griffin 11 years ago.

36:09.485 --> 36:10.735
Merv Griffin.

36:14.281 --> 36:17.825
I'll tell you what. It doesn't
ever have to be published.

36:17.910 --> 36:18.993
No one ever has to read it.

36:19.286 --> 36:21.079
I'll just keep it for myself.

36:21.163 --> 36:23.331
No one will even
know it exists.

36:24.291 --> 36:28.336
As long as it does exist,
your mind won't ever be free.

36:32.591 --> 36:35.301
I think you should
light the match, Paul.

36:44.019 --> 36:46.771
Can't you see
it's what God wants?

36:46.855 --> 36:47.939
You're so brilliant,

36:48.023 --> 36:50.900
I would think you'd certainly
be able to see that.

36:53.529 --> 36:57.073
We're put on this earth
to help people, Paul.

36:57.157 --> 36:59.909
Like I'm trying
to help you.

37:00.953 --> 37:04.872
Please. Help me help you.

37:23.267 --> 37:25.393
You're doing the right thing.

37:34.361 --> 37:38.239
My goodness! Goodness gracious!
Oh, my.

37:43.078 --> 37:46.164
Goodness!
Heavens to Betsy!

37:46.248 --> 37:49.000
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!

37:50.919 --> 37:54.088
Heavens to Betsy!
Oh, goodness!

38:13.233 --> 38:15.485
Well, isn't that
an oogy mess?

38:37.633 --> 38:40.093
That's the Steadman place
down there.

38:40.844 --> 38:43.429
And that's the Wilkes farm
straight ahead.

38:46.809 --> 38:48.935
That's no '65 Mustang.

38:50.813 --> 38:53.815
There's nothing else out this way.
Let's... Let's circle back.

39:07.454 --> 39:08.746
I do believe
the winters are getting

39:08.831 --> 39:11.207
shorter and shorter
every year.

39:11.291 --> 39:15.128
People say it has something
to do with the ozone layer.

39:15.212 --> 39:16.254
What do you think?

39:17.798 --> 39:19.632
I don't know.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.343
Yeah, well, it's a theory.

39:30.853 --> 39:32.687
Here's your Novril.

40:11.143 --> 40:12.393
All right. We're back.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.061
Now, you're gonna have to remind
us who the audience chose.

40:14.188 --> 40:16.522
- They chose Kevin.
- They chose Kevin.

40:18.525 --> 40:20.526
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hi. How you doin', Chuck?

40:20.611 --> 40:22.403
Fine. Make yourself
at home back there,

40:22.488 --> 40:25.156
and Sheree will tell us
about the date.

40:25.240 --> 40:29.076
Okay. First of all, I picked
out a very classy restaurant.

40:29.161 --> 40:33.456
It was so classy, and he
shows up without no tie...

41:32.266 --> 41:34.308
See, isn't this nice?

41:34.393 --> 41:37.895
Great. I always wanted to visit
the other side of the room.

41:37.980 --> 41:40.565
And look what
I got for you.

41:42.067 --> 41:45.528
An electric razor, so you
can shave yourself now.

41:49.908 --> 41:52.910
If I knew this was gonna be the
surprise, I'd have burned all my books.

41:52.995 --> 41:55.454
Now, don't poke fun!

41:56.748 --> 41:58.708
This is a very big
day for you, Paul.

41:58.792 --> 42:01.794
You just sit tight and
I'll set everything up.

42:02.963 --> 42:04.338
Set what up?

42:04.423 --> 42:06.048
That's the
big surprise.

42:06.842 --> 42:08.676
Your new studio.

42:09.678 --> 42:13.097
After all, writers
do need a place to work.

42:13.181 --> 42:15.683
Work? You mean write?

42:17.686 --> 42:19.770
What in the world
do you think I'd write?

42:19.855 --> 42:23.482
Paul, I don't think.
I know.

42:24.192 --> 42:26.527
Now that you've gotten rid
of that nasty manuscript,

42:26.612 --> 42:29.614
you can go back to doing
what you're great at.

42:29.698 --> 42:31.324
You're gonna write
a new novel,

42:31.408 --> 42:33.701
your greatest
achievement ever.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.536
Misery's Return.

42:36.622 --> 42:38.247
Misery's Return?

42:38.999 --> 42:41.417
I know you didn't mean it
when you killed her,

42:41.501 --> 42:43.586
and now
you'll make it right.

42:45.088 --> 42:47.465
It'll be a book
in my honor,

42:47.549 --> 42:50.217
for saving your life and
nursing you back to health.

42:50.927 --> 42:55.348
Paul, you're gonna make me
the envy of the whole world!

42:55.849 --> 42:58.893
You just expect me to whip
something off, is that it?

42:58.977 --> 43:02.063
I expect nothing less
than your masterpiece.

43:04.191 --> 43:07.860
You do understand that this
is not the ordinary way

43:07.944 --> 43:09.403
in which books get written.

43:09.488 --> 43:13.157
I mean, some people might actually
consider this an oddball situation.

43:13.241 --> 43:15.826
I have total confidence
in your brilliance.

43:15.911 --> 43:18.204
Besides, the view
will inspire you.

43:18.914 --> 43:21.707
You just inhale that.
I'll be right back.

43:34.012 --> 43:36.180
I guess you don't get
bothered by neighbors much.

43:36.264 --> 43:37.973
Don't you
worry about that,

43:38.058 --> 43:41.644
you'll have total solitude so you
can concentrate on your work.

43:41.728 --> 43:42.937
Great.

43:44.648 --> 43:47.566
I got you this expensive
paper to type on,

43:47.651 --> 43:49.902
and I got a great deal
on this 50-pound clunker,

43:49.986 --> 43:52.321
on account of
its missing an "N."

43:52.406 --> 43:54.865
I told the saleslady
"N" was one of the letters

43:54.950 --> 43:56.534
in my favorite writer's name.

43:59.454 --> 44:04.458
It's two of the letters in my
favorite nurse's name, A-nn-ie.

44:04.960 --> 44:08.838
You fooler! Did I do good?

44:08.922 --> 44:10.464
You did great.

44:13.802 --> 44:16.137
There is just
one little thing.

44:19.182 --> 44:24.562
I can't work on this paper. See,
it's Corrasable Bond. It smudges.

44:24.646 --> 44:28.441
So I thought maybe,
if you went back into town,

44:28.525 --> 44:31.986
you could bring me
some white long-grain mimeo.

44:33.321 --> 44:37.241
But mine cost the most, so I
don't see how it can smudge.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.286
Come here, I'll show you.

44:59.097 --> 45:03.684
It does smudge, after all.
Isn't that fascinating.

45:04.186 --> 45:06.437
I thought
you'd be interested.

45:06.521 --> 45:09.106
I'd like for you to be
in on everything, Annie.

45:09.191 --> 45:12.318
Not just the finished book,
but how it's written.

45:13.612 --> 45:15.821
Thank you
for thinking of me.

45:20.118 --> 45:22.953
Anything else I can get
while I'm in town?

45:23.371 --> 45:26.540
Any other crucial requirements
that need satisfying?

45:26.625 --> 45:28.918
Would you like
a tiny tape recorder?

45:29.002 --> 45:31.629
Or how about a handmade set
of writing slippers?

45:31.713 --> 45:34.340
No, just the paper
will be fine.

45:34.966 --> 45:36.217
Are you sure?

45:36.301 --> 45:39.553
'Cause if you want, I'll bring
back the whole store for you.

45:39.763 --> 45:42.723
Annie, what's the matter?

45:42.808 --> 45:45.309
What's the matter? I'll
tell you what's the matter!

45:45.393 --> 45:47.019
I go out of my way for you!

45:47.103 --> 45:48.896
I do everything to try
and make you happy!

45:48.980 --> 45:52.942
I feed you, I clean you, I dress
you, and what thanks do I get?

45:53.026 --> 45:54.568
"You bought
the wrong paper, Annie.

45:54.653 --> 45:56.445
"I can't write on
this paper, Annie!"

45:56.530 --> 45:57.822
Well, I'll get
your stupid paper,

45:57.906 --> 45:59.198
but you just better
start showing me

45:59.282 --> 46:01.909
a little more appreciation
around here, Mister Man!

47:31.082 --> 47:32.583
Shit.

47:54.689 --> 47:57.524
Come on, you've written
about this, now do it.

48:05.825 --> 48:08.410
What do you know?
It actually works.

48:39.567 --> 48:41.568
What a surprise.

49:21.401 --> 49:23.235
You crazy bitch.

54:49.812 --> 54:52.105
Paul, I've got your paper.

54:52.774 --> 54:56.610
I hope it's enough. It's three
reams of long-grain mimeo.

54:56.694 --> 54:59.029
Just the kind you asked for.

55:00.490 --> 55:04.701
Paul, you're dripping
with perspiration.

55:05.286 --> 55:08.747
Your color is very hectic.
What have you been doing?

55:08.831 --> 55:11.708
You know damn well
what I've been doing.

55:11.793 --> 55:13.543
I've been
sitting here suffering.

55:13.628 --> 55:16.046
I need my pills.

55:16.130 --> 55:19.925
Poor dear. Let's get you back in
bed and I'll get them for you.

55:20.009 --> 55:21.760
I want my pills now!

55:21.844 --> 55:22.844
It'll only take a second.

55:22.929 --> 55:24.054
No!

55:24.889 --> 55:28.266
I want my pain
to go away, Annie.

55:29.477 --> 55:32.020
Please, make it go away.

55:33.356 --> 55:37.234
Please, Annie. Please.

55:40.988 --> 55:43.907
It just breaks my heart
to see you like this.

55:54.085 --> 55:56.336
I've done a lot
of thinking on the drive.

55:56.421 --> 55:57.671
Here you go.

55:58.631 --> 56:02.592
And I'm absolutely certain the main
reason I've never been more popular

56:02.677 --> 56:04.886
is because of my temper.

56:04.971 --> 56:08.682
You must be so mad at me.
The truth, now.

56:10.226 --> 56:14.521
Well... Who doesn't let off a
little steam every once in a while?

56:16.190 --> 56:19.109
My genius needs his rest
before he writes.

56:25.032 --> 56:26.533
Footsies up.

56:27.869 --> 56:29.327
There you go.

56:42.550 --> 56:46.595
Here. In case you think
of any ideas.

56:47.638 --> 56:49.890
Well, I wouldn't
expect too much.

56:50.641 --> 56:53.977
Don't be silly!
You'll be brilliant.

56:54.061 --> 56:55.896
Think of me as
your inspiration.

57:01.068 --> 57:03.361
I have faith in you,
my darling.

57:03.988 --> 57:05.405
Catch this.

57:16.417 --> 57:17.959
"My darling."

57:49.784 --> 57:53.870
The presumption must now be
that Paul Sheldon is dead.

57:53.955 --> 57:57.040
We know that he somehow managed
to crawl outside his vehicle,

57:57.124 --> 57:59.125
but we have been unable
to find his body

57:59.210 --> 58:01.294
anywhere in the vicinity
of the accident.

58:01.379 --> 58:03.213
We also know that
if anyone had found him

58:03.297 --> 58:06.091
they would have taken him
to an area hospital.

58:06.175 --> 58:09.177
Undoubtedly he is buried
somewhere out there in the snow.

58:10.012 --> 58:12.055
We'll find him
after the first thaw.

58:12.139 --> 58:14.015
That is, unless the animals
didn't get to him first,

58:14.100 --> 58:15.600
which is
a distinct possibility.

58:15.685 --> 58:16.851
Local papers...

58:17.144 --> 58:20.063
That was a statement from Colorado
Police Chief Sherman Douglas.

58:20.147 --> 58:21.398
The whereabouts of famed
novelist Paul Sheldon is...

58:21.482 --> 58:23.900
We will be updating
you with the latest...

58:32.326 --> 58:34.411
You don't think
he's dead, do you?

58:34.495 --> 58:38.123
Well, he might well be,
but not the way they say.

58:38.207 --> 58:41.042
He never crawled out of
that car by himself.

58:41.127 --> 58:43.628
You can see the dents
on the door there.

58:43.713 --> 58:45.672
Someone pulled him out.

01:00:38.119 --> 01:00:40.620
I'm sorry, Paul.
This is all wrong.

01:00:40.705 --> 01:00:41.705
What?

01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:43.373
You'll have to
do it over again.

01:00:43.457 --> 01:00:45.875
It's not worthy of you.
Throw it all out.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.002
Except for that part of naming
the gravedigger after me.

01:00:48.087 --> 01:00:49.963
You can leave that in.

01:00:51.799 --> 01:00:54.551
I really value
your criticism,

01:00:54.635 --> 01:00:56.386
but maybe we're being
a little hasty here.

01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:59.264
Paul, what you've written
just isn't fair.

01:00:59.348 --> 01:01:00.390
Not fair?

01:01:00.474 --> 01:01:01.516
That's right.

01:01:01.809 --> 01:01:03.268
When I was growing
up in Bakersfield,

01:01:03.352 --> 01:01:04.728
my favorite thing
in all the world

01:01:04.812 --> 01:01:07.731
was to go to the movies on Saturday
afternoons for the chapter plays.

01:01:07.815 --> 01:01:09.023
Cliffhangers.

01:01:09.108 --> 01:01:10.900
I know that, Mister Man!

01:01:10.985 --> 01:01:14.654
They also call them serials.
I'm not stupid, you know!

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.076
Anyway, my favorite
was Rocketman,

01:01:20.161 --> 01:01:22.036
and once it was
a no-brakes chapter,

01:01:22.121 --> 01:01:24.247
and the bad guys stuck him
in a car on a mountain road,

01:01:24.331 --> 01:01:26.082
and knocked him out
and welded the doors shut

01:01:26.167 --> 01:01:28.293
and tore out the brakes
and started him to his death.

01:01:28.377 --> 01:01:30.962
And he woke up and tried to
steer and tried to get out,

01:01:31.046 --> 01:01:33.339
but the car went off a cliff
before he could escape,

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:34.632
and it crashed and burned

01:01:34.717 --> 01:01:36.551
and I was so upset
and excited!

01:01:36.635 --> 01:01:39.095
And the next week, you better
believe I was first in line.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.264
And they always start with
the end of the last week,

01:01:41.348 --> 01:01:43.600
and there was Rocketman,
trying to get out,

01:01:43.684 --> 01:01:45.185
and here comes the cliff,

01:01:45.269 --> 01:01:48.563
and just before the car went
off the cliff he jumped free,

01:01:48.647 --> 01:01:50.356
and all the kids cheered!

01:01:51.025 --> 01:01:54.819
But I didn't cheer. I stood
right up and started shouting,

01:01:54.904 --> 01:01:56.821
"This isn't what
happened last week!

01:01:56.906 --> 01:01:58.782
Have you all got amnesia?

01:01:58.866 --> 01:02:01.785
"They just cheated us!
This isn't fair!

01:02:01.869 --> 01:02:05.663
"He didn't get out
of the cockadoodie car!"

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.799
They always cheated like
that in chapter plays.

01:02:15.883 --> 01:02:20.345
But not you.
Not with my Misery.

01:02:20.429 --> 01:02:22.388
Remember Ian did ride
for Dr. Cleary

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:24.808
at the end of the last book, but
his horse fell jumping that fence,

01:02:24.892 --> 01:02:27.310
and Ian broke his shoulder and his
ribs and lay all night in the ditch

01:02:27.394 --> 01:02:28.728
and he never reached
the doctor,

01:02:28.813 --> 01:02:31.147
so there couldn't have been any
experimental blood transfusion

01:02:31.232 --> 01:02:33.066
that saved her life.

01:02:33.192 --> 01:02:35.652
Misery was buried in the
ground at the end, Paul,

01:02:35.736 --> 01:02:38.071
so you'll have
to start there.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:21.030
Is it fair?
Should I continue?

01:03:22.324 --> 01:03:24.200
You better!

01:03:24.285 --> 01:03:27.370
Oh, Paul!
When Ian realized that

01:03:27.454 --> 01:03:28.872
the reason they'd
buried Misery alive

01:03:28.956 --> 01:03:31.624
was because the bee sting had
put her in that temporary coma!

01:03:31.709 --> 01:03:34.878
And when Gravedigger Wilkes
remembered how 30 years earlier

01:03:34.962 --> 01:03:37.130
the same thing had happened
to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.258
And then old Dr. Cleary
deduced that Misery

01:03:40.342 --> 01:03:42.385
must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's
long-lost daughter

01:03:42.469 --> 01:03:46.347
because of the rarity of deadly
bee stings, my heart just leapt!

01:03:46.432 --> 01:03:47.891
I've known from
the very first book

01:03:47.975 --> 01:03:49.559
that Misery had to
be born of nobility

01:03:49.643 --> 01:03:51.019
and I was right!

01:03:51.103 --> 01:03:52.103
Yeah.

01:03:52.187 --> 01:03:54.397
Paul, can I read each chapter
when you're finished?

01:03:54.481 --> 01:03:56.691
I can fill in the "N's."

01:03:57.526 --> 01:03:59.944
Will she be her old self
now that Ian has dug her out,

01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:01.404
or will she have amnesia?

01:04:01.488 --> 01:04:02.655
Have to wait.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:05.867
Will she still love him with
that special, perfect love?

01:04:05.951 --> 01:04:07.368
You'll have to wait.

01:04:07.453 --> 01:04:08.745
Not even a hint?

01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:09.954
Uh-uh.

01:04:11.332 --> 01:04:15.919
Misery's alive, Misery's alive!
It's so romantic!

01:04:16.003 --> 01:04:19.255
This whole house is gonna
be filled with romance!

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.549
I'm gonna put on
my Liberace records!

01:04:26.013 --> 01:04:28.598
You do like Liberace,
don't you?

01:04:28.974 --> 01:04:30.099
Whenever he played
Radio City,

01:04:30.184 --> 01:04:32.644
who do you think was right
there in the front row?

01:04:32.728 --> 01:04:35.813
I'm gonna play my records
all day long, to inspire you.

01:04:35.898 --> 01:04:37.523
He's my all-time favorite.

01:04:37.858 --> 01:04:39.108
Annie.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.656
Would you have
dinner with me tonight?

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.532
To celebrate Misery's Return.

01:04:49.828 --> 01:04:52.455
I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:04:54.833 --> 01:04:55.833
Paul.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.796
It would be an honor.

01:05:06.845 --> 01:05:08.805
No, he's not here.

01:05:08.889 --> 01:05:10.139
I don't know where he is.

01:05:10.224 --> 01:05:12.141
He never tells me
anything anymore.

01:05:12.226 --> 01:05:15.478
He's probably out
havin' an affair somewhere.

01:05:15.562 --> 01:05:17.814
Wait a minute.
He's comin' in now.

01:05:17.898 --> 01:05:19.357
It's Jim Taylor.

01:05:19.441 --> 01:05:22.193
He wants to know who you're
havin' an affair with.

01:05:23.278 --> 01:05:25.405
Hello, Jim.
What's doin'?

01:05:27.908 --> 01:05:30.576
Jim, we've been
through this before.

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:33.162
If you're gonna have benches
out in front of your store,

01:05:33.247 --> 01:05:35.748
people are gonna want
to sit on 'em.

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:37.875
Well, I don't like him,
either,

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.544
but I'm not gonna
come over there

01:05:39.628 --> 01:05:41.421
and tell him to move.

01:05:42.214 --> 01:05:44.757
Give my best to
Denise. Bye.

01:05:46.051 --> 01:05:49.470
Well, whoever she is,
she sure likes to read a lot.

01:05:50.431 --> 01:05:55.059
Virginia, I'm flattered that you
think I've got that much energy.

01:05:56.812 --> 01:05:59.313
I figured that if
I can't find Paul Sheldon,

01:05:59.398 --> 01:06:02.275
at least I can find out
what he wrote about.

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:04.027
What do you expect to find?

01:06:04.111 --> 01:06:08.197
A story about a guy who drove his
car off a cliff in a snowstorm?

01:06:10.034 --> 01:06:12.535
You see, it's just
that kind of sarcasm

01:06:12.619 --> 01:06:14.746
that's given our marriage
real spice.

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:30.553
I hope you like it.

01:06:30.637 --> 01:06:31.971
It looks wonderful.

01:06:33.057 --> 01:06:35.058
So do you.

01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:07.048
I've never had meatloaf this good.
What do you do to it?

01:07:07.132 --> 01:07:10.426
My secret is I only use fresh
tomatoes, never canned.

01:07:10.511 --> 01:07:12.095
And to give it
that little extra zip,

01:07:12.179 --> 01:07:14.263
I mix in some Spam
with the ground beef.

01:07:18.018 --> 01:07:21.020
Can't get this in a
restaurant in New York.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.612
Let's have a toast.

01:07:29.696 --> 01:07:30.738
A toast?

01:07:30.823 --> 01:07:33.366
Yes. To Misery.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:34.534
Let me pour you some wine.

01:07:52.761 --> 01:07:54.178
To Misery.

01:07:58.058 --> 01:08:02.061
Wait. Let's do this right.
Do you have any candles?

01:08:04.982 --> 01:08:08.276
I don't know.
I think so.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.944
I'll go look.

01:08:17.578 --> 01:08:20.746
Did you study decorating
or do you just have a flair?

01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:23.541
Oh, you!

01:08:23.625 --> 01:08:26.294
I just picked things up
over the years.

01:08:26.879 --> 01:08:28.962
Well,
it certainly says you.

01:08:29.046 --> 01:08:31.090
You really think so?

01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:32.591
Absolutely.

01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:35.970
Listen, if you can't
find any, it's okay.

01:08:36.054 --> 01:08:38.221
I just thought it'd be nice.

01:08:38.849 --> 01:08:41.642
Are you kidding? If anyone had
ever told me that one day

01:08:41.727 --> 01:08:43.310
I'd be having
a candlelit dinner

01:08:43.395 --> 01:08:45.604
with Paul Sheldon
in my own house,

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:46.898
I would have checked
both legs

01:08:46.982 --> 01:08:50.109
to see which one
was bein' pulled!

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:53.154
Will this do?

01:08:53.738 --> 01:08:55.238
It's perfect.

01:09:00.787 --> 01:09:05.457
To Misery and to Annie Wilkes,
who brought her back to life.

01:09:06.792 --> 01:09:09.837
Paul, I get goose bumps
every time I think about it!

01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:14.800
My God, what have I done?

01:09:14.885 --> 01:09:16.844
I'm so sorry, Paul!

01:09:17.136 --> 01:09:19.471
I ruined your
beautiful toast!

01:09:22.267 --> 01:09:24.310
Will you ever forgive me?

01:09:24.895 --> 01:09:27.188
Here, let me
pour another one.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:36.154
Can we pretend
this never happened?

01:09:39.993 --> 01:09:41.661
To Misery.

01:09:42.287 --> 01:09:43.662
To Misery.

01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:31.919
Paul, this is positively the
best Misery you've ever written.

01:11:40.989 --> 01:11:42.823
Here's your pills.

01:11:44.618 --> 01:11:45.785
Annie?

01:11:49.164 --> 01:11:50.790
Annie, what is it?

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:53.626
The rain.

01:11:55.295 --> 01:11:57.630
Sometimes it
gives me the blues.

01:12:01.301 --> 01:12:04.387
When you first came here,

01:12:04.471 --> 01:12:06.806
I only loved the writer
part of Paul Sheldon.

01:12:09.351 --> 01:12:12.311
But now I know I love
the rest of him, too.

01:12:18.944 --> 01:12:21.112
I know you don't love me.

01:12:22.239 --> 01:12:23.989
Don't say you do.

01:12:25.659 --> 01:12:30.287
You're a beautiful, brilliant,
famous man of the world

01:12:30.372 --> 01:12:35.167
and I'm not
a movie-star type.

01:12:42.008 --> 01:12:45.094
You'll never know the fear
of losing someone like you,

01:12:45.178 --> 01:12:47.221
if you're someone like me.

01:12:48.306 --> 01:12:50.182
Why would you lose me?

01:12:54.062 --> 01:12:56.397
The book's almost finished.

01:12:58.525 --> 01:13:00.734
Your legs are getting better.

01:13:02.154 --> 01:13:04.864
Soon you'll be
wanting to leave.

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:08.701
Why would I leave?
I like it here.

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:14.206
That's very kind of you, but I'll
bet it's not altogether true.

01:13:32.309 --> 01:13:33.976
I have this gun.

01:13:38.273 --> 01:13:40.733
Sometimes I think
about using it.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.908
I better go now.

01:13:51.912 --> 01:13:53.996
I might put bullets in it.

01:14:42.295 --> 01:14:45.422
"There is a justice
higher than that of man.

01:14:45.507 --> 01:14:47.841
"I will be judged by Him."

01:14:47.926 --> 01:14:49.093
What?

01:14:49.177 --> 01:14:51.595
They're haulin'
Misery into court.

01:14:52.764 --> 01:14:54.390
That's nice.

01:15:02.357 --> 01:15:06.819
There is a justice
higher than that of man.

01:15:08.363 --> 01:15:12.866
I will be judged by Him.

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:39.007
See you in the morning.

01:20:30.518 --> 01:20:35.105
I'm supposed to lead to
the finale of my show right now,

01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:38.066
but I'm having such a
wonderful time that I have...

01:20:38.151 --> 01:20:39.318
Paul.

01:20:43.781 --> 01:20:44.865
Hmm?

01:20:45.992 --> 01:20:47.993
I know you've been out.

01:20:52.999 --> 01:20:54.166
What?

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:56.501
You've been out of your room.

01:20:57.587 --> 01:20:59.421
No, I haven't.

01:20:59.505 --> 01:21:02.424
Paul, my little
ceramic penguin

01:21:02.508 --> 01:21:04.676
in the study
always faces due south.

01:21:07.138 --> 01:21:10.265
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:21:11.184 --> 01:21:12.684
Ceramic penguin?

01:21:13.937 --> 01:21:16.355
Is this what
you're looking for?

01:21:18.691 --> 01:21:21.109
I know you've
been out twice, Paul.

01:21:21.194 --> 01:21:23.737
At first I couldn't
figure out how you did it,

01:21:23.821 --> 01:21:26.406
but last night
I found your key.

01:21:30.495 --> 01:21:33.288
I know I left
my scrapbook out.

01:21:33.373 --> 01:21:35.874
I can imagine what you
might be thinking of me.

01:21:35.959 --> 01:21:38.543
But you see, Paul,
it's all okay.

01:21:38.628 --> 01:21:41.046
Last night it came so clear.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.382
I realize you just
need more time.

01:21:43.466 --> 01:21:46.551
Eventually you'll come to
accept the idea of being here.

01:21:47.804 --> 01:21:49.471
Paul, do you know
about the early days

01:21:49.555 --> 01:21:51.848
at the Kimberley
diamond mines?

01:21:51.933 --> 01:21:55.602
Do you know what they did to the
native workers who stole diamonds?

01:21:55.687 --> 01:21:58.146
Don't worry.
They didn't kill them.

01:21:58.231 --> 01:21:59.982
That would be like
junking a Mercedes

01:22:00.066 --> 01:22:01.858
just because it had
a broken spring.

01:22:01.943 --> 01:22:03.986
No, if they caught them
they had to make sure

01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:05.362
they could go on working,

01:22:05.446 --> 01:22:08.490
but they also had to make sure
they could never run away.

01:22:08.574 --> 01:22:11.159
The operation
was called "hobbling."

01:22:20.878 --> 01:22:25.257
Annie, whatever you're
thinking about doing,

01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:27.092
please don't do it.

01:22:31.597 --> 01:22:33.223
Annie, for God's...

01:22:33.307 --> 01:22:36.226
Darling. Trust me.

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:37.352
God's sake!

01:22:37.437 --> 01:22:38.437
It's for the best.

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:39.855
Annie, please!

01:22:42.942 --> 01:22:46.028
Almost done.
Just one more.

01:22:55.329 --> 01:22:57.122
God, I love you.

01:23:27.278 --> 01:23:28.987
You cockadoodie!

01:23:43.002 --> 01:23:44.086
Turn on this!

01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:45.253
You poop!

01:24:01.312 --> 01:24:03.063
Just leave it, all right?

01:24:03.147 --> 01:24:05.357
I like that tone!

01:24:05.441 --> 01:24:07.025
How many times do I
have to tell you?

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:10.278
I have a system here! Where
the hell is that thing?

01:24:10.363 --> 01:24:11.530
What thing?

01:24:11.614 --> 01:24:12.697
The thing!

01:24:14.117 --> 01:24:16.368
Here it is, right where
it's supposed to be.

01:24:16.452 --> 01:24:17.536
What is it?

01:24:18.246 --> 01:24:20.455
I'm not sure.
Maybe nothin'.

01:24:20.832 --> 01:24:22.749
Well, I'm glad you found it.

01:24:22.834 --> 01:24:24.417
There's that spice again.

01:25:40.453 --> 01:25:43.455
Come on, Misie.
Come on.

01:25:44.457 --> 01:25:45.999
Hi, pumpkin.

01:25:48.961 --> 01:25:52.339
Such a kidder!
Come on, Misery.

01:26:02.558 --> 01:26:04.434
Hey, Pete.

01:26:04.518 --> 01:26:05.727
Buster.

01:26:05.811 --> 01:26:07.687
Answer me a couple things.

01:26:07.772 --> 01:26:09.564
If I can.

01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:12.150
Do you have any new
Paul Sheldon books?

01:26:12.235 --> 01:26:13.693
Well, we had a batch.

01:26:13.778 --> 01:26:15.862
Sold 'em all out
in three days.

01:26:15.947 --> 01:26:20.200
You wouldn't happen to know if Miss
Wilkes bought one of them, would you?

01:26:20.284 --> 01:26:23.912
Are you kiddin'? Every time
that fella writes a new book,

01:26:23.996 --> 01:26:26.665
she has me set aside
the first copy.

01:26:27.792 --> 01:26:30.877
Has she been buyin'
anything odd lately?

01:26:30.962 --> 01:26:34.589
Miss Wilkes?
Same old stuff.

01:26:35.549 --> 01:26:38.301
Lest you call paper odd.

01:26:38.386 --> 01:26:39.719
Newspaper?

01:26:39.804 --> 01:26:42.597
No. The typin' kind.

01:26:42.682 --> 01:26:46.101
That kind.
Nothin' odd about that.

01:26:46.185 --> 01:26:47.936
Miss Wilkes done somethin'?

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.312
Not a thing.

01:27:50.416 --> 01:27:52.876
I don't think I'll ever understand you.
I cook your meals,

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.046
I tend to you practically
24 hours a day,

01:27:56.130 --> 01:27:58.340
and you continue
to fight me.

01:27:58.424 --> 01:28:00.759
When are we going to
develop a sense of trust?

01:28:30.122 --> 01:28:31.414
Oh, my.

01:28:31.749 --> 01:28:33.541
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you,

01:28:33.626 --> 01:28:35.960
but you didn't give me
a chance to knock.

01:28:36.045 --> 01:28:37.629
I guess you can tell
from my reaction

01:28:37.713 --> 01:28:40.048
I'm not all that used
to visitors out here.

01:28:40.132 --> 01:28:41.508
What can I do for you?

01:28:41.592 --> 01:28:43.885
Well, I was wonderin', do
you happen to know anything

01:28:43.969 --> 01:28:46.388
about Paul Sheldon?

01:28:46.472 --> 01:28:48.556
What do you want to know?

01:28:48.641 --> 01:28:51.017
Well, anything you
could tell me might help.

01:28:52.311 --> 01:28:55.230
Well, he was born in Worcester,
Massachusetts, 45 years ago,

01:28:55.314 --> 01:28:57.148
the only child of Franklin
and Helene Sheldon,

01:28:57.233 --> 01:28:58.733
mediocre student,
majored in History...

01:28:58.818 --> 01:29:01.903
Well that... That isn't exactly the
kind of information I'm after.

01:29:01.987 --> 01:29:04.447
You see, he's been missin'
for quite some time now...

01:29:04.532 --> 01:29:06.408
I know. It's so upsetting.

01:29:06.492 --> 01:29:07.742
I'm his number-one fan.

01:29:07.827 --> 01:29:10.412
I've got all his books. Every
sentence he ever put down.

01:29:10.496 --> 01:29:13.456
I'm so proud of my
Paul Sheldon collection.

01:29:15.626 --> 01:29:18.253
Well, here I am,
prattling on,

01:29:18.337 --> 01:29:19.587
and my manners
have just flown away.

01:29:19.672 --> 01:29:21.673
I haven't invited you in.
Please.

01:29:21.757 --> 01:29:23.174
Thank you.

01:29:24.427 --> 01:29:27.846
Of course, you must know all
about that horrible accident.

01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:29.639
Mind if I take a look around?

01:29:29.723 --> 01:29:31.015
Of course not.

01:29:32.017 --> 01:29:34.644
That accident almost
killed me, too.

01:29:34.728 --> 01:29:36.521
I prayed when
I heard the news.

01:29:36.605 --> 01:29:40.150
I got down on my knees and I
begged for it not to be true.

01:29:40.234 --> 01:29:41.818
You're gonna laugh
at what I'm about to say,

01:29:41.902 --> 01:29:45.238
but go ahead,
I don't care.

01:29:45.322 --> 01:29:48.783
When I was praying,
God told me to get ready.

01:29:49.493 --> 01:29:50.869
Get ready
for what?

01:29:50.953 --> 01:29:52.996
To be his replacement.

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.915
He gave so much pleasure
to so many people,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.793
and there's a shortage of pleasure
on the planet these days,

01:29:58.878 --> 01:30:00.920
in case you
hadn't noticed.

01:30:01.005 --> 01:30:03.798
God told me, since I was
his number-one fan,

01:30:03.883 --> 01:30:07.343
that I should make up new stories
as if I was Paul Sheldon.

01:30:07.428 --> 01:30:10.597
So I went to town, and
I bought a typewriter,

01:30:10.681 --> 01:30:11.806
and paper to type on,

01:30:11.891 --> 01:30:14.309
the same kind
Paul Sheldon used.

01:30:14.393 --> 01:30:17.270
And I turned the guest bedroom
into a writing studio.

01:30:17.354 --> 01:30:18.813
Would you like to see it?

01:30:18.898 --> 01:30:19.898
Sure.

01:30:19.982 --> 01:30:21.149
It's right this way.

01:30:30.993 --> 01:30:34.162
I know how he wrote. The
kinds of words he used,

01:30:34.246 --> 01:30:36.498
the wonderful stories
he told.

01:30:36.582 --> 01:30:37.790
I've spent the last
four weeks

01:30:37.917 --> 01:30:40.001
trying to write
like Paul Sheldon,

01:30:40.085 --> 01:30:41.878
but I can't do it right.

01:30:41.962 --> 01:30:46.925
I try and I try, and I know all the
words, but it's just not the same.

01:30:47.009 --> 01:30:50.803
Well, maybe it takes a while
to get the hang of it.

01:30:50.888 --> 01:30:53.056
I could give you a couple
of hundred pages of mine

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:54.849
and you could tell
me what you think.

01:30:54.934 --> 01:30:56.684
I'm not much of a critic.

01:30:56.769 --> 01:30:59.354
Well, I just thought...

01:30:59.438 --> 01:31:02.106
Oh, look at me. You'd think
I'd never had a guest before!

01:31:02.191 --> 01:31:03.900
Would you like a nice
hot cup of cocoa?

01:31:03.984 --> 01:31:04.984
No, really, I don't...

01:31:05.069 --> 01:31:06.361
It's no trouble.

01:31:06.445 --> 01:31:08.613
There's some already made.

01:31:15.329 --> 01:31:18.623
Must get lonely, livin'
out here all by yourself.

01:31:20.501 --> 01:31:23.044
Well, I always say, if you
can't enjoy your own company,

01:31:23.128 --> 01:31:25.505
you're not fit company
for anyone else.

01:31:25.589 --> 01:31:27.966
Well, you've got
a point there.

01:32:34.992 --> 01:32:35.950
Here you are.

01:32:36.035 --> 01:32:37.994
Well, thanks, Miss Wilkes,

01:32:38.078 --> 01:32:40.246
but I don't want to take up
any more of your time.

01:32:42.041 --> 01:32:43.958
I best be goin'.

01:32:44.043 --> 01:32:47.003
But you didn't even
taste your cocoa.

01:32:47.087 --> 01:32:51.174
I'm sure it's wonderful, but I
really should be gettin' back.

01:32:56.889 --> 01:32:58.806
If you wouldn't mind,
perhaps I could

01:32:58.891 --> 01:33:00.475
pay you another
visit sometime.

01:33:00.559 --> 01:33:03.603
I'd be delighted,
now that you know the way.

01:33:21.914 --> 01:33:23.247
Miss Wilkes?

01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:26.959
Miss Wilkes,
are you all right?

01:33:28.003 --> 01:33:29.545
Here!

01:33:29.963 --> 01:33:32.215
Here! I'm down here!

01:33:32.591 --> 01:33:34.425
I'm down here!

01:33:37.429 --> 01:33:38.846
Mr. Sheldon?

01:33:49.608 --> 01:33:51.609
Don't feel bad, Paul.

01:33:52.194 --> 01:33:55.697
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

01:33:55.781 --> 01:33:56.906
It's a sign.

01:33:59.284 --> 01:34:03.871
You see, I've known for some time
why I was chosen to save you.

01:34:03.956 --> 01:34:07.208
You and I were meant
to be together forever.

01:34:07.292 --> 01:34:09.711
But now our time
in this world must end.

01:34:10.921 --> 01:34:13.089
But don't worry, Paul.

01:34:13.173 --> 01:34:15.091
I've prepared
for what must be done.

01:34:16.635 --> 01:34:21.889
I put two bullets in my gun,
one for you and one for me.

01:34:23.183 --> 01:34:25.601
Darling,
it'll be so beautiful.

01:34:45.330 --> 01:34:47.498
Now don't be afraid.

01:34:48.751 --> 01:34:50.168
I love you.

01:34:53.672 --> 01:34:55.506
I love you, too.

01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:02.346
And you're right.
We are meant to be together.

01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:05.850
And I know we must die.

01:35:07.144 --> 01:35:11.355
But it must be
so that Misery can live.

01:35:13.692 --> 01:35:18.237
We have the power
to give Misery eternal life.

01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:22.074
We must finish the book.

01:35:25.496 --> 01:35:28.998
But the time is now.
Soon others will come.

01:35:30.959 --> 01:35:32.794
It's almost finished.

01:35:34.546 --> 01:35:35.880
By dawn

01:35:37.341 --> 01:35:41.886
we'll be able to give Misery
back to the world.

01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:07.161
I'll fix you
something to eat.

01:36:23.804 --> 01:36:25.805
Paul, I'm dying!

01:36:25.889 --> 01:36:28.933
Does she wind up
with Ian or Windthorne?

01:36:29.017 --> 01:36:31.060
You'll know very soon.

01:36:31.144 --> 01:36:33.104
I've just started
the last chapter.

01:36:33.939 --> 01:36:39.443
You know, when I finish, I'd
like everything to be perfect.

01:36:40.445 --> 01:36:42.530
I'll need three things.

01:36:42.614 --> 01:36:44.115
What things?

01:36:45.367 --> 01:36:47.368
You mean you don't know?

01:36:48.787 --> 01:36:51.163
I was foolin', silly.

01:36:51.248 --> 01:36:54.417
You need a cigarette, because
you used to smoke but you quit,

01:36:54.501 --> 01:36:58.045
except when you finish a
book, and you have just one.

01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:00.172
And the match
is to light it,

01:37:00.257 --> 01:37:04.385
and you need one glass of
champagne, Dom Perignon.

01:37:05.679 --> 01:37:07.471
Dom Perignon it is.

01:37:27.701 --> 01:37:31.329
Annie, Annie?

01:37:32.623 --> 01:37:33.998
Yes, Paul?

01:37:35.876 --> 01:37:37.960
I'm almost done.

01:37:38.045 --> 01:37:40.755
Oh, Paul,
this is so romantic!

01:37:40.839 --> 01:37:44.175
Ian and Windthorne dueling for
the right to Misery's hand.

01:37:44.259 --> 01:37:46.969
Does Ian win?
Don't tell me.

01:37:47.054 --> 01:37:48.346
It's Windthorne, right?

01:37:48.889 --> 01:37:51.724
You'll know everything
in a minute.

01:37:51.808 --> 01:37:53.059
Get the champagne.

01:38:29.721 --> 01:38:31.389
Did I do good?

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:34.725
You did perfect.

01:38:36.728 --> 01:38:38.562
Except for one thing.

01:38:40.107 --> 01:38:42.942
This time we'll need
two glasses.

01:38:44.403 --> 01:38:46.278
Oh, Paul.

01:39:21.314 --> 01:39:22.648
Remember how,
for all those years,

01:39:22.733 --> 01:39:25.609
nobody knew who
Misery's real father was?

01:39:25.694 --> 01:39:28.237
Or if they'd
ever be reunited?

01:39:28.321 --> 01:39:29.822
It's all right here.

01:39:29.906 --> 01:39:33.784
Does she finally marry Ian,
or will it be Windthorne?

01:39:33.869 --> 01:39:35.661
It's all right here.

01:39:37.956 --> 01:39:40.082
Paul, you can't!

01:39:40.167 --> 01:39:42.626
Why not?
I learned it from you.

01:39:44.713 --> 01:39:48.799
No, no, no! Not Misery!
Not my Misery!

01:39:49.301 --> 01:39:51.802
No! Not my Misery!

01:40:03.982 --> 01:40:06.734
I'm gonna kill you,
you lying cocksucker!

01:40:45.857 --> 01:40:48.859
Here, you want it?
You want it? Eat it!

01:40:49.027 --> 01:40:53.697
Eat it till you choke,
you sick, twisted fuck!

01:42:46.770 --> 01:42:49.480
This is it.
The very first copy.

01:42:50.357 --> 01:42:53.359
The word I'm getting is the Times
review is gonna be a love letter.

01:42:53.443 --> 01:42:54.902
That'll be a first.

01:42:54.986 --> 01:42:58.239
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek
tell me they're both raves.

01:42:58.323 --> 01:43:00.115
And don't laugh,
but for the first time

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.326
I think you've got
a shot at some prizes.

01:43:02.410 --> 01:43:03.994
Great.

01:43:04.079 --> 01:43:06.205
I thought you'd be thrilled.

01:43:06.289 --> 01:43:07.998
You're being taken seriously.

01:43:08.083 --> 01:43:10.042
I'm delighted
the critics are liking it

01:43:10.126 --> 01:43:12.294
and I hope the people
like it, too.

01:43:12.754 --> 01:43:15.089
But I wrote it for me.

01:43:16.007 --> 01:43:19.468
Now, don't think
I'm completely nuts, but...

01:43:20.345 --> 01:43:24.181
In some way, Annie Wilkes,

01:43:25.016 --> 01:43:27.017
that whole experience,

01:43:28.353 --> 01:43:30.604
helped me.

01:43:30.689 --> 01:43:32.731
Paul, since you
brought her up,

01:43:32.816 --> 01:43:36.318
I have to ask you this or I'll be
drummed out of the agents' union.

01:43:36.403 --> 01:43:38.320
How would you feel
about a non-fiction book

01:43:38.405 --> 01:43:40.281
about what went on
in that house?

01:43:40.365 --> 01:43:42.783
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you
better, I'd think you were suggesting

01:43:42.867 --> 01:43:44.326
I dredge up the worst
horror of my life

01:43:44.411 --> 01:43:47.204
just so we can make
a few bucks.

01:43:48.164 --> 01:43:49.790
I thought you
were over it.

01:43:49.874 --> 01:43:53.585
I don't know if anyone could ever
totally get over something like that.

01:43:53.670 --> 01:43:55.087
It's weird.

01:43:56.631 --> 01:43:58.924
Even though I know
she's dead,

01:44:00.385 --> 01:44:03.429
I still think about
her once in a while.

01:44:03.513 --> 01:44:07.433
Excuse me. I don't mean to bother
you, but are you Paul Sheldon?

01:44:07.517 --> 01:44:09.018
Yes.

01:44:09.102 --> 01:44:11.729
I just want to tell you
I'm your number-one fan.

01:44:12.731 --> 01:44:14.773
That's very sweet of you.
