<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:
-I'm your Uncle Claudius.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.929
Daddy never said anything
about having a brother.

00:13.012 --> 00:15.515
The Lodges. Have I dreamt
of getting my revenge on them.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.893
Now, Claudius, first things first,
Nana then Cheryl.

00:18.977 --> 00:22.230
Effective immediately,
Southside High School is shut down.

00:22.313 --> 00:25.442
-Okay, let's not overreact.
Hiram is like Dracula.

00:25.525 --> 00:29.112
He's snapping up properties
to expand his empire and feed.

00:29.195 --> 00:32.365
Twilight Drive-In, Sunnyside Trailer Park,
Southside High,

00:32.449 --> 00:36.119
-and Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.
-Southside High will be turned into--

00:36.202 --> 00:40.248
-A private, for-profit prison.
-We are leaving, and we are leaving now.

00:40.331 --> 00:43.460
-Dad, I'll stay.
-This tradition has been in my family

00:43.543 --> 00:46.337
going back generations.
Archie, we come first.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.339
The only way I can get Chic
to open up--

00:48.423 --> 00:49.674
But catfishing him?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.676
When you wouldn't submit
the DNA test,

00:51.760 --> 00:54.471
I found your dental floss
and sent it to the lab.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.723
You're not who you say you are,
Chic.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.518
<i>One sheet of paper.</i>

01:01.102 --> 01:04.773
<i>That's all it took to confirm everything</i>
<i>Betty had feared.</i>

01:05.899 --> 01:10.153
<i>That she'd let a dangerous stranger</i>
<i>into her house.</i>

01:12.238 --> 01:14.449
This is why you didn't want
the DNA test.

01:14.532 --> 01:18.078
Because you knew the results.
You have no Blossom blood.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.705
I don't. I'm not a Blossom.
I don't know them.

01:20.789 --> 01:25.376
Blossom blood is Cooper blood, Chic.
My dad was a Blossom,

01:25.460 --> 01:29.756
which means you would've tested positively
for Blossom DNA, but you didn't

01:29.839 --> 01:31.257
because you're an imposter.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.384
-Mom.
<i>Betty, listen.</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:38.389
The truth is, Chic's DNA doesn't match...

01:39.557 --> 01:41.434
because Hal isn't his father.

01:42.685 --> 01:46.397
Then who is Chic's father?
-Chic's my son.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.323
Whoever the father is
won't be a part of our lives.

01:55.406 --> 01:59.577
There's no reason to open old wounds
that have healed many times over.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.372
Come here.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.927
Now, for our <i>Register </i>readers,

02:16.010 --> 02:19.806
why would you, Hermione Lodge,
run for mayor of Riverdale?

02:19.889 --> 02:22.100
Every year, our population decreases,

02:22.183 --> 02:25.478
more and more businesses close.
We're at a deficit.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.189
We need to change that
before it's too late.

02:28.273 --> 02:32.485
That is why Lodge Industries has secured
a bid for a maximum security prison

02:32.569 --> 02:36.406
on the Southside. Now, that means jobs,
economic growth, stability.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.492
-It'll give Riverdale its future back.
-I have to ask.

02:39.951 --> 02:43.121
You're building a prison
on the bones of a school.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.206
Are you okay with that?

02:45.290 --> 02:49.711
Losing a school is a tough pill
to swallow, but once our facility is up,

02:49.794 --> 02:53.464
a quarter of our earnings
are gonna be funneled into education.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.342
We are building a brand-new wing
at Riverdale High.

02:58.303 --> 03:02.974
And, Veronica, are you going to follow
and run for student body president

03:03.057 --> 03:06.603
-Maybe, if I don't have my hands full

03:06.686 --> 03:08.229
campaigning for my mom.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.441
I'm excited to show Riverdale
she's more than a housewife.

03:11.524 --> 03:16.237
And speaking of housewives,
we have a very special guest, Bravo's very own Andy Cohen.
Mr. Cohen, what brings you to Riverdale?

03:21.701 --> 03:25.663
I'm here to endorse my great friend,
Hermione Lodge.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.790
She's a very savvy businesswoman,

03:27.874 --> 03:30.501
always three steps ahead
of everyone around her.

03:30.585 --> 03:34.797
She's a fighter, too. She doesn't give up.
I'd love to have her in my corner.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.967
Kevin just died
and went to Clubhouse heaven.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.179
-Thank you for letting me invite him, Mom.
-Of course.

03:41.262 --> 03:44.599
Any and all goodwill during this election
will go a long way.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.394
And, Veronica...

03:50.563 --> 03:52.482
this campaign isn't gonna be easy

03:52.732 --> 03:56.152
since we had to lead
with your father's plans for the prison.

03:56.319 --> 04:00.657
Certain people in town and in school
are gonna see us as the enemy.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.786
After this endorsement,
let's keep our heads down,

04:04.869 --> 04:08.373
-Color me a wallflower.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.725
Dad, I know you think a prison
is a bad idea for Riverdale,

04:27.809 --> 04:30.520
but Mr. and Mrs. Lodge
have thought this through.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.856
A prison would rip the soul out
of the Southside.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.944
So, I'm not gonna support that plan,
or Hiram and Hermione.

04:38.027 --> 04:42.490
I'm severing ties with Lodge Industries
and SoDale. All of it. I'm done.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.076
Just like that?
Will they let you walk away?

04:45.159 --> 04:46.786
I'm not asking his permission.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.540
They will, or they'll have
a hell of a fight on their hands.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.294
I just loved your spin piece
in the paper, Olivia Pope.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.878
Can we not, Jughead?

04:55.962 --> 04:58.256
Did you know about Southside High closing?
Or the prison?

04:58.339 --> 05:01.509
Of course not. That was all
her parents' doing. Right, V?

05:04.304 --> 05:07.098
She didn't know, Jughead, okay?
So, back off.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.310
Fine. I have to conserve my energy anyhow.

05:11.436 --> 05:15.440
I'm going on a hunger strike
to protest Southside High closing

05:15.982 --> 05:18.109
-and to get it reopened.

05:18.192 --> 05:19.569
What?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.071
Sorry, man, it's just--

05:22.155 --> 05:25.074
You're always eating.
Good luck with that, but--

05:25.158 --> 05:28.286
Hey, it's Jughead's prerogative
to protest peacefully,

05:31.456 --> 05:32.874
Oh, hey, Ethel.

05:32.957 --> 05:36.753
For your crimes against Riverdale,
everything your family has done

05:36.836 --> 05:40.757
and continue to do, we find you guilty.
Your sentence is this.

05:53.227 --> 05:56.314
The chilling thing is
Ethel went through the trouble

05:56.397 --> 05:59.442
of bringing that milkshake here
from Pop's.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.944
I mean, how mad is she?

06:03.446 --> 06:07.575
My dad is responsible for the Muggs family
losing basically everything.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.703
And he still hasn't made amends, so...

06:10.787 --> 06:13.915
Ethel has a right to be upset.
-So do you.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.000
Are you sure you're okay?

06:17.502 --> 06:18.336
I'll manage.

06:18.878 --> 06:22.006
I'm impressed.
I'd wanna rip Ethel's head off.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.468
As my mom keeps saying,
"This is not the time for drama

06:25.551 --> 06:27.178
and flying off the handle."

06:27.637 --> 06:28.554
I just need...

06:30.056 --> 06:33.726
to take deep breaths, keep smiling,
turn the other cheek.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.813
Give Ethel a wide berth.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.821
Veronica, I heard you got
a face full of dairy.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.658
-I've got some nuts to top off that shake.
-Leave her alone, Reggie.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.952
You do not wanna push me right now.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.413
One question I gotta ask
as future student body president:

06:54.497 --> 06:56.999
What are the odds
your dad's the first inmate

06:57.083 --> 07:00.628
in that prison he's building?
Oh, man, that's heavy.

07:00.711 --> 07:04.549
He'd be considered one of us.
Or is he building a female prison, too?

07:05.007 --> 07:06.509
For your mom? Maybe I'll visit...

07:09.512 --> 07:10.346
For your mom?

07:35.496 --> 07:36.747
Who's there?

07:43.212 --> 07:47.467
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Cheryl. No one
was trying to break into your room.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.636
You're imagining things.
You're worse than Nana Rose.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.682
-I know what I heard and saw.
-Claudius, we should talk about you

07:54.765 --> 07:57.810
taking over Nana's stewardship
of the syrup business.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.980
That factory's mine.
I'm not dead yet, you vultures.

08:01.063 --> 08:04.233
Oh, Mother, now, come, come.
Let's not get too upset.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.905
Have some more of Penelope's tea.
It's a special blend that she makes.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.789
Are we feeling calmer this morning?

08:18.873 --> 08:22.126
We are.
I'm drinking my High Point decaffeinated.

08:22.210 --> 08:26.255
-Again, I'm sorry, Mom.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.512
Maybe if you'd offered Mr. Muggs
a job at the prison,

08:33.095 --> 08:36.724
-all of this could've been avoided.
-Oh, no, no, no. No,<i> mija.</i>

08:37.266 --> 08:38.809
We tell you what to do.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.898
And right now, we're telling you, again,
keep your head in the sand.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.816
Before it gets cut off.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.613
We need you to be our good,
obedient little girl.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.491
You can do that, right?

08:57.370 --> 09:00.873
Friends, I have an exciting
announcement to make.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.876
I'm running for student council president

09:03.960 --> 09:08.089
-against Reggie "the Misogynist" Mantle.
You've gotta be kidding me.

09:08.172 --> 09:11.342
If yesterday's dramatic events
taught me anything,

09:11.425 --> 09:16.556
it's that Veronica Lodge is not a victim,
nor will she ever allow herself to be one.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.850
Your parents are taking over Riverdale,
you wanna take over school?

09:19.934 --> 09:21.936
What is this, part of Mommy
and Daddy's evil bidding?

09:22.019 --> 09:25.106
I get you're in a bad mood
because you haven't eaten--

09:25.189 --> 09:28.317
Actually, my parents think
I should avoid the spotlight.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.153
-But I was born for elected office.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.198
V, if you wanna be president,
you've got our vote.

09:34.282 --> 09:39.453
-Yeah, Team Ronnie all the way.
-B, as the Thelma to my Louise,

09:39.537 --> 09:42.248
I couldn't imagine doing this
with anyone else.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.667
Will you be my running mate?

09:47.503 --> 09:49.171
Of course, V.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.091
-I'd be honored.
-Amaze.

09:52.550 --> 09:56.137
B and V. Now, that's a team
you can believe in.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.266
[DJ OLFO's "Rumbamba"
playing on speakers]

10:21.078 --> 10:24.665
I don't think there's any way
you amateurs are gonna top that,

10:24.749 --> 10:26.417
so practice is over, Vixens.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.836
Inner circle Vixens, hang back.
You know who you are.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.131
In honor of Toni joining our squad,

10:32.465 --> 10:36.135
I think we should celebrate
with a slumber party at Thistlehouse.

10:36.218 --> 10:39.889
Fancy dressing gowns are appreciated.
You've all seen <i>The Beguiled.</i>

10:40.723 --> 10:42.850
Dinner at 8, parlor games to follow.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.104
And there's nothing I can say
to change your mind?

10:47.188 --> 10:49.774
Afraid not.
I just wanna get out of this thing.

10:49.857 --> 10:53.986
As quickly, cleanly as I can. You go
about your business, I go about mine.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.656
I understand.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.326
And I will talk to Hiram.

11:01.661 --> 11:06.707
-We need to get our lawyers involved.
-Yeah, yeah. I kind of figured that.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.919
<i>What can you tell me</i>
<i>about Jughead's hunger strike?</i>

11:11.462 --> 11:12.880
Yes, I heard about that.

11:13.964 --> 11:18.344
Jughead loves a political crusade
almost as much as he does a burger.

11:18.427 --> 11:22.723
Your friend seems to live in a
fantasy world of ideals and theoreticals.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.434
What if Southside High were to reopen?

11:27.019 --> 11:31.399
I live in the real world.
I see what needs to be done, and I do it.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.984
I think you do, too, Archie.

11:35.569 --> 11:38.906
I'm accelerating our timeline
on Southside High. I was wondering

11:38.989 --> 11:41.742
if you could send Jughead a message.

11:43.452 --> 11:46.872
-Yeah, whatever you need, Mr. Lodge, but--
I think it'll soften the blow
to hear it coming from a friend.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.755
Hiram's tearing down
Southside High by the end of this week?

11:54.839 --> 11:58.342
He's supposed to give the neighborhood
a six-weeks' notice.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.679
Who'd he pay off? Can I have
another water, Pop? Thank you.

12:02.888 --> 12:08.519
Jug, my dad got shot right here because
Riverdale was sliding off the deep end.

12:08.602 --> 12:11.981
And if Mr. Lodge's plan
can shore things up

12:12.064 --> 12:15.234
and help make Riverdale
more secure for our families,

12:15.317 --> 12:18.737
I think that's a good thing.
Besides, why do you care so much?

12:18.821 --> 12:21.490
You were only at Southside High
for four days.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.161
You remember that I was raised
on the Southside, right?

12:25.870 --> 12:28.122
My mom, my dad, Jellybean.

12:28.622 --> 12:31.876
That neighborhood is the last
tangible piece I have of them.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.503
Until your dad comes in
with his bulldozers.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.965
My dad's actually against
this whole thing.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.302
He's pulling out of his deal
with the Lodges.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.680
And you're choosing Hiram's side over his.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.933
We see things differently, okay?
And it makes me sick.

12:48.642 --> 12:53.022
Like when you and your best friend
are two trains running on the same track

12:53.105 --> 12:56.108

destined to collide?

13:13.667 --> 13:16.462
The truth is, I'm terrified
of being alone here.

13:17.087 --> 13:20.341
There's a stranger in this house,
my Uncle Claudius.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.969
He's mad. Ever since he blew in,
I feel like I'm in mortal peril.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.764
I'm confused.
Is this real or are we playing?

13:26.847 --> 13:31.060
All too real, Tee-Tee. I fear they're
plotting against me and Nana Rose.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.708
Which is...

14:37.376 --> 14:38.419
what I craved.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.590
<i>♪ And it's times like these ♪</i>

15:00.941 --> 15:03.861
A fall like that should've killed her.
She's lucky.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.571
Yes, that she is.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.657
Poor thing loses her senses at nightfall.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.243
It's classic sundowner's syndrome.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.995
Cheryl, what is it?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.749
-He's wearing my father's pajamas.
What?

15:16.832 --> 15:17.666
My uncle. Toni...

15:22.004 --> 15:24.548
I think they pushed
my nana down the stairs.

15:25.674 --> 15:26.926
And I think I'm next.

15:32.848 --> 15:33.724
Mom?

15:33.807 --> 15:34.892
Archie.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.228
Hi, how are you?

15:39.396 --> 15:42.399
-I had no idea you were coming.
-I've missed you.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.446
All this contract stuff with the Lodges?

15:47.613 --> 15:49.323
Time to call in the big guns.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.916
I wish you'd called me in earlier, Fred,
before you gave the Lodges

15:58.999 --> 16:00.960
20 percent of Andrews Construction.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.671
Mr. Lodge says he'll work this out.
He'll keep his word.

16:03.754 --> 16:08.175
Yeah, son, your mother and I have known
the Lodges a lot longer than you have.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.468
Meaning what, Dad?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.095
Archie.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.433
It's okay. I better get to school, anyway.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.227
We still on for lunch, Mom?

16:24.441 --> 16:25.985
Hands where I can see them.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.820
[Betty Everett's "Shoop Shoop Song"
playing]

16:27.903 --> 16:28.904
There you go.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.407
-Now, remember, vote Lodge-Cooper.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.449
Okay, who's next?

16:32.533 --> 16:35.327
The cupcakes are
from Magnolia Bakery in New York,

16:35.411 --> 16:38.455
but the kisses, however,
are locally sourced.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.919
-Uh, five-minute hydration break.
Come on!

16:44.253 --> 16:45.295
Ethel, wait.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.007
Sexualizing the election?

16:48.090 --> 16:51.301
It might get you the boys,
but forget about the girls.

16:51.593 --> 16:55.264
Right now,
I'm only interested in one girl, you.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.393
Look, I know it's long overdue,
but I wanna make reparations.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.355
So, I'm working it out with my parents,
and tell your dad

17:03.439 --> 17:05.983
to expect a great job offer
very, very soon.

17:06.942 --> 17:10.696
This isn't a demolition notice.
It's a notice of extermination.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.074
We've already said our goodbye
to Southside.

17:14.158 --> 17:18.495
Today, it's Southside High,
tomorrow, it's the Wyrm.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.081
Everything that makes
the Southside home...

17:22.499 --> 17:23.625
is gonna disappear.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.380
If we roll over now, it's all over.

17:28.464 --> 17:32.551
-It's just a building, Jug.
-No, Toni, it's the soul of the Southside.

17:34.178 --> 17:38.557
The Uktena fought and died
trying to protect that land.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.936
Our parents fought
to keep it safe during the riots.

17:44.855 --> 17:45.981
Now it's our turn.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.941
It's our time.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.651
This is our fight.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.321
So, who's with me?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.285
Who's ready to go to war?

17:58.744 --> 18:01.955
Archie, I really hate to see you
and your father fighting.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.165
We're not, Mom.

18:03.874 --> 18:07.795
And look, you and Veronica,
it's your first real relationship.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.840
I just wanna make sure
that you're not being...

18:13.509 --> 18:15.886
-led astray.

18:17.721 --> 18:21.517
To align yourself with her family
against your better judgments.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.353
It's not like that.
Veronica is an amazing person.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.896
I'm sure she is.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.942
But I guess I'm just saying...
so is your dad.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.739
Just the milk is.
The best you can get.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.200
Can't get anymore more milky.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.535
So, good milk.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.328
It is.

18:41.703 --> 18:42.538
Uh...

18:44.456 --> 18:47.668
-Chic invited me over.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.128
Cookie?

18:50.420 --> 18:51.338
No thanks.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.216
How do you guys even know each other?

18:54.800 --> 18:59.138
It's a funny story. Kevin and I
have been continuing our online chats.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.432
Imagine my surprise
when he finally told me

19:02.516 --> 19:05.519
it all started as a catfishing scheme
you cooked up.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.647
-I felt bad.

19:08.730 --> 19:12.359
Okay, you need to leave.
I need to talk to my brother alone.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.945
-Mm-hm.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.239
It's okay, Kev. I'll catch you later.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.746
Do not mess with my friends.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.834
Mess with?
What do you think I'm doing here, Betty?

19:28.917 --> 19:33.005
Clearly, there's something you want,
some void you're looking to fill.

19:33.088 --> 19:36.633
Like brother, like sister, right?
We share the same darkness.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.302
Isn't that what you said?

19:38.969 --> 19:40.512
Yeah, I guess I was wrong.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.016
You know nothing about my darkness.

19:46.018 --> 19:46.852
But you will.

19:51.440 --> 19:56.987
Josie, look, I know things haven't been
smooth sailing between us.

19:57.070 --> 20:01.283
Are we even on speaking terms? I mean,
you did steal the Pussycats from me.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.869
Borrowed them, after you dumped them.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.245
What do you want?

20:05.829 --> 20:08.207
A celebrity endorsement for my campaign.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.374
Yours.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.502
And before you say no, Andy Cohen

20:13.170 --> 20:16.131
is a very old,
very good friend of the family.

20:17.299 --> 20:21.762
My ears are perked, because I never miss
an episode of <i>Watch What Happens: Live.</i>

20:24.264 --> 20:27.267
-If you can make that happen...

20:27.809 --> 20:30.646
-consider yourself endorsed.
-Amazing.

20:31.271 --> 20:36.276
My point is, Hermione, some may read
this document as exploitative.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.447
-Come on, now, Mary. Now, that's not fair.
-Fair would be an immediate

20:40.530 --> 20:44.117
and compensated release from the contract.
How does that sound?

20:44.201 --> 20:47.746
-Oh, I'm sorry. That keeps buzzing.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.040
Hiram here.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.877
They're doing what?

21:00.342 --> 21:01.176
Mr. Lodge

21:06.431 --> 21:08.141
Yeah, don't worry. I'm on it.

21:17.526 --> 21:22.322
Well, well, well, cavalry's finally here.
Guess that means we got Hiram's attention.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.158
Are you nuts?
Chaining yourself to this place?

21:25.784 --> 21:28.120
They're gonna tear it down in two days.

21:28.203 --> 21:32.207
Not unless Hiram wants the blood
of eight young Serpents on his hands.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.792
We're not going anywhere.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.670
Go and tell your boss we said that.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.938
-Hello, brother.

21:57.482 --> 22:01.820
You think you're the only one
who can scare people by being crazy?

22:02.779 --> 22:05.615
You may have fooled my mother, but not me.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.618
I'm gonna bring you down.

22:11.621 --> 22:14.333
Because I catch bad men.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.793
I caught Clifford Blossom.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.211
I caught the Sugarman.

22:19.713 --> 22:23.884
I caught the Black Hood.
And you know what they all have in common?

22:24.885 --> 22:25.719
They're dead.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.847
Consider yourself warned.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.904
God, why didn't you call me last night?

22:43.987 --> 22:45.906
I would have brought you blankets.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.741
And you would've tried to stay.

22:47.824 --> 22:51.328
Are you sure you're not gonna get arrested
for trespassing

22:51.411 --> 22:53.830
or protesting without a permit?

22:54.206 --> 22:55.040
No.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.751
That's the beauty of all this, Betty.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.921
If Sheriff Keller or his goons try
and manhandle teens

23:01.004 --> 23:04.216
peacefully trying to save their school,
it'll look ugly.

23:04.883 --> 23:08.011
Not to mention probably go viral, which...

23:08.428 --> 23:11.056
at this point,
is publicity I would welcome.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.768
Also, no one's gonna mess
with those guys there.

23:17.104 --> 23:21.191
Good point. I have some student council
obligations with Veronica.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.485
But I'll be back later tonight, okay?

23:25.028 --> 23:26.696
Go get them, Tracy Flick.

23:28.031 --> 23:30.158
<i>We live in uncertain times.</i>

23:30.242 --> 23:33.578
But here's one thing I'm very certain of:

23:33.662 --> 23:37.415
My girl Ronnie here,
along with her running mate, Betty Cooper,

23:38.375 --> 23:42.546
has my vote to be Riverdale High's
next president and vice president.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.756
And, of course, we remind everyone,

23:44.840 --> 23:48.885
especially the women,
to vote and be heard this election.

23:53.348 --> 23:56.226

24:43.481 --> 24:44.608
Okay, what's going on?

24:49.362 --> 24:52.449
-Doesn't matter.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.034
It's the truth, isn't it?

24:54.492 --> 24:55.619
I don't understand.

24:56.119 --> 24:59.164
I told you
that your dad would get a job offer.

24:59.247 --> 25:03.043
You mean your half
Yeah, too little, too late.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.505
B, wait.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.425
This is insane.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.265
Thanks for the intel, Josie.

25:17.724 --> 25:18.558
No problem.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.062
The Lodges hurt a lot of people this year.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.439
Your family, my family.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.984
We girls gotta stick together.

25:31.404 --> 25:35.158
That day when Weatherbee announced
that Southside High was closing,

25:35.242 --> 25:37.410
you acted like you didn't know.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.746
When my parents asked me to help them,

25:40.538 --> 25:44.626
-I didn't feel like I could say no.
-Of course you could've.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.755
You could've told your parents that you
didn't wanna be their accomplice,

25:48.838 --> 25:50.882
or you could've told us the truth.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.051
Instead, you played us like fools.

25:53.134 --> 25:57.722
No, I was trying to keep them honest.
That's why I started working with them.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.100
-You have to believe me.
-Even if I did...

26:00.183 --> 26:03.395
I can't be your running mate anymore.
You know that.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.565
I can't trust you, V.

26:16.616 --> 26:17.993
Veronica?

26:18.827 --> 26:21.121
Rough day on the campaign trail?

26:22.831 --> 26:25.542
-Weatherbee called.

26:28.336 --> 26:31.089
He read me the flyer
that's going around school.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.758
See why we asked you
to keep a low profile?

26:33.842 --> 26:37.512
And instead, you're running
for student council president

26:38.305 --> 26:39.389
Because, Mom...

26:40.807 --> 26:42.309
I'm out there, every day,

26:42.600 --> 26:45.520
facing what you and Daddy have done,
what we've done.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.605
And maybe if I'm their president,

26:48.064 --> 26:51.151
people at school,
like Ethel Muggs or Jughead or--

26:52.152 --> 26:57.324
Or even Betty... will stop looking at me
like I'm just the daughter of criminals.

26:57.407 --> 27:01.578
Like I'm a criminal, too.
We're out there fighting a holy war, Mom.

27:01.661 --> 27:04.289
I need something I can use as a shield.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.584
Against everything that's coming our way.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.338
Protection from everybody out there
who hates us.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.715
Who's out for our blood.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.430
Stop right there, young lady.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.723
Come in here now.

27:23.224 --> 27:26.144
Is it true that you snuck
into your brother's room

27:26.227 --> 27:28.730
to torment him with a Zippo lighter?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.940
And what exactly is this for?

27:31.024 --> 27:34.903
Oh, my God. You creep. What did you do,
go through my dresser drawers?

27:34.986 --> 27:36.613
I was looking for the lighter

27:36.696 --> 27:40.492
-and found all your secret toys.

27:40.575 --> 27:42.952
She wears it
when she has sex with Jughead.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.996
Is that true, Elizabeth?

27:45.288 --> 27:46.373
I...

27:48.875 --> 27:51.252
How would you even know that?

27:52.879 --> 27:54.005
I was guessing.

27:54.089 --> 27:54.923
Guessing?

27:57.675 --> 27:58.593
Betty. What

27:59.677 --> 28:00.887
Is it Is it true?

28:01.679 --> 28:02.514
Are you

28:03.807 --> 28:05.183
Are you and Jughead...?

28:07.185 --> 28:08.645
Yeah, Mom, we are. Last man standing.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.494
What happened to no Serpent left behind?

28:24.994 --> 28:29.749
They were claiming frostbite. They'll be
back after some coffee and they warm up.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.876
Too bad. I got a dozen burgers.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.838
Guess they're all yours now.

28:37.382 --> 28:42.178
Come on, it's just you and me. I won't
tell anyone you broke your hunger strike.

28:45.432 --> 28:46.266
So, uh...

28:48.393 --> 28:51.062
just like clockwork,
I got a call from Hiram.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.775
-You know how they're saying SoDale

28:55.859 --> 28:58.069
will mostly be low

28:58.153 --> 29:02.323
Well, apparently, there'll be
a few penthouses at the top.

29:03.616 --> 29:07.704
It would be more than enough space
for all of us. Your mom, Jellybean.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.749
Just like you always wanted.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.000
Just imagine me...

29:13.668 --> 29:16.671
standing on that balcony
and looking over a prison.

29:18.965 --> 29:22.302
In the same spot that my friends
and I used to go to school.

29:25.180 --> 29:28.516
And Jellybean, growing up in a town...

29:29.934 --> 29:33.521
where her best hope, her only hope,
aside from getting the hell out,

29:33.605 --> 29:34.981
is to work at the prison?

29:36.065 --> 29:36.983
It's not right.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.784
-Nothing. I hung up

29:45.867 --> 29:48.203
and went to Pop's and got some burgers.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.628
I was hoping to see Jughead.

29:56.711 --> 29:59.631
He's still at Southside High, Mom,
chained up.

29:59.714 --> 30:02.509
You may not believe
in what he's fighting for...

30:02.592 --> 30:05.887
I'm not sure he's fighting
for anything, Dad.

30:06.930 --> 30:11.434
I think he's fighting against Mr. Lodge,
like people in this town who are afraid.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.771
-Archie.
Afraid of what?

30:14.854 --> 30:18.858
Afraid of having a vision, of seeing
what has to be done and doing it.

30:20.401 --> 30:22.862
I hope you're not referring
to your father. This man who broke rocks
when he was in school

30:25.698 --> 30:28.117
to support his family
when his dad was sick.

30:28.201 --> 30:31.371
A man who saw what had
to be done and did it,

30:31.454 --> 30:33.581
and built a business out of nothing.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.417
One that pays for this house
and the food you eat.

30:36.501 --> 30:40.421
For your information, your father
had and has a vision for Riverdale, one that doesn't end up
with everyone working in a penal colony.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.636
You don't have to side with your dad.

30:46.719 --> 30:49.430
You can side with Hiram,
even though he's a crook

30:49.514 --> 30:52.183
and has no intention
of letting your father out.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.893
You can do that. That is your right.

30:53.977 --> 30:58.189
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit here
and listen to you disrespect him.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.627
Betty, I have to ask.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.840
-Yes, Mom.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.634
-Of course.
-Well, that's something.

31:28.261 --> 31:31.472
Because, look,
when I was your age, I wasn't always.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.308
But you need to be.

31:33.558 --> 31:38.980
And I am very well acquainted
with how alluring the Jones men are.

31:40.273 --> 31:44.444
Whoa. Wait. Mom, did you and FP...?

31:45.737 --> 31:49.324
I mean, is it possible
that FP is Chic's dad?

31:49.407 --> 31:50.408
Absolutely not.

31:51.659 --> 31:56.205
But Chic is a part of our family.
He's your brother.

31:56.789 --> 31:59.834
I know that he's odd and damaged.

32:00.376 --> 32:03.046
I see that. I'm not blind.

32:03.129 --> 32:07.550
But for the past 25 years,
he hasn't had anyone to love him.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.094
He's dangerous.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.681
Mom, don't forget what he did.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.391
I will never forget, Betty.

32:16.684 --> 32:18.102
But Chic needs us.

32:32.784 --> 32:33.660
<i>Dr. Masters?</i>

32:34.744 --> 32:38.122
-Yes, we just got her panel back.

32:38.957 --> 32:42.126
There was a paralytic toxin
in her bloodstream.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.088
Tannis root. Which is strange,
because it's so rare.

32:45.171 --> 32:49.550
Your mom and uncle have caught your nana
on more than one occasion

32:49.634 --> 32:52.345
chewing Tannis root
she grows in your greenhouse.

32:52.428 --> 32:55.348
So, it's more of her sundowner syndrome.

32:55.431 --> 32:58.559
We'll keep her another day,
then she'll return home.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.354
To my mother and uncle?
You don't understand--

33:01.437 --> 33:05.483
Cheryl. There you are.
Looking a little worse for wear.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.111
Poor dear hasn't slept in days.

33:08.194 --> 33:11.781
Why don't we stop bothering Dr. Masters
and I'll take you home?

33:12.490 --> 33:13.366
Come on.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.283
Sorry.

33:21.958 --> 33:26.087
Mom says we should bury the hatchet.
So, for her sake, how about a truce?

33:30.633 --> 33:33.678
Why should I believe you when all
you've done is try to get rid of me?

33:34.387 --> 33:37.807
If I really wanted
to get rid of you, Chic...

33:38.850 --> 33:41.394
I would go to the sheriff's office
and explain to him

33:41.477 --> 33:43.938
how you brained a man in our kitchen.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.192
You're not gonna do that.

33:51.070 --> 33:53.698
You see, I never touched that body, Betty.

33:54.115 --> 33:58.578
Or the car. Or went
through his phone, or called his contacts.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.663
I didn't go to the sewer pipe.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.500
It's not my fingerprints or hair
they're gonna find.

34:05.043 --> 34:09.547
Maybe I should call the police, tell them
what my sister is capable of doing.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.299
You wouldn't dare.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.637
I'm not comfortable
being in a room with someone

34:16.721 --> 34:18.097
who's done those things.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.100
It scares me, Betty.

34:21.684 --> 34:24.187
You scare me. Can't you see that?

34:24.896 --> 34:28.107
You're scaring me, Betty.
You're scaring me.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.827
I think I figured it out.

34:41.704 --> 34:44.248
You paralyzed Nana Rose
with the Tannis root

34:44.332 --> 34:46.167
and pushed her down the stairs.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.839
You've gone mad.
That's all there is to it.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.509
You have lost your mind and--

34:55.927 --> 34:57.553
And you leave us no choice.

35:00.014 --> 35:01.808
What do you mean, no choice?

35:02.266 --> 35:03.392
But it's all right.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.980
We're gonna make you all better.

35:11.109 --> 35:11.943
All better.

35:13.861 --> 35:19.367
Every hour that passes that Jughead
is out there is bad for business.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.704
Time to remove Jughead
and his fellow Serpents by force.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.499
Grown
Wouldn't that be bad?

35:26.582 --> 35:29.836
If Sheriff Keller and his men do it, yes.

35:31.337 --> 35:33.589
But boys, led bravely by you?

35:34.340 --> 35:37.510
The wrestling team.
No one would be too upset by that.

35:37.593 --> 35:38.427
I can't.

35:40.346 --> 35:41.764
I'm sorry, I won't.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.853
Archie, you made a promise to me.

35:47.353 --> 35:49.939
An oath to this family in this very room.

35:53.192 --> 35:56.487
-You break it, there will be consequences.
-I understand.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.824
So... you'll help me?

36:02.285 --> 36:03.494
Yes, sir.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.586
But I hope you can prove
your loyalty to me in return.

36:12.211 --> 36:14.088
And how would I do that?

36:14.172 --> 36:17.842
By releasing my dad
from all commitments to Lodge Industries.

36:22.638 --> 36:27.268
<i>Save our school.</i>
<i>Save our school. Save our school.</i>

36:28.728 --> 36:30.271
Send a car by the station.

36:50.625 --> 36:54.629
Cops may let you by, but you come in here,
and I'll knock you down.

36:54.712 --> 36:58.299
Dad, don't. They'll throw you in jail.
Don't give them an excuse.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.594
I'm sorry, Jughead.

37:03.763 --> 37:04.597
Me, too.

37:06.974 --> 37:08.893
I'm not gonna fight you, Archie.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.188
Look around.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.651
Now people know what Hiram's doing.

37:17.985 --> 37:21.113
What's happening here.
This fight is not gonna go away.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.823
We're not going to go away.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.744
So, go on. Cut us down.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.580
I want them to see you do it.

38:22.425 --> 38:26.012
Do you think it made any difference?
Us freezing our asses off?

38:26.095 --> 38:27.138
Definitely.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.600
Every revolution starts somewhere.

38:31.684 --> 38:32.518
Good.

38:33.853 --> 38:37.565
'Cause I've been thinking.
We lost Southside High.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.818
I don't want to lose Riverdale High, too.

38:43.404 --> 38:47.325
And you've not heard more unlikely words
come from my mouth, but...

38:53.789 --> 38:56.125
I wanna run for student body president.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.670
And I want you to be my co-president.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.715
-I know that you and Veronica--
-Okay.

39:05.593 --> 39:08.554
Just like that?
-Just like that.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.599
I'm in, Jug.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.685
There is no me and Veronica.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.523
You have to do me a favor, though.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.362
You have to let me stay here.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.408
I can't stay in the same house
as Chic anymore.

39:33.162 --> 39:33.996
Okay. Okay.

39:45.674 --> 39:49.136
-Your pal Hiram Lodge called.

39:49.595 --> 39:52.098
He's letting your dad out of his contract.

39:52.181 --> 39:55.810
Well, I never doubted your mom
for a second. Knew she'd do it.

39:55.893 --> 39:56.727
Wow, that's--

39:57.937 --> 40:00.231
-That's great.
-Yeah, and another thing.

40:00.314 --> 40:03.859
-We've been talking--
-I'll stick around for a while.

40:03.943 --> 40:07.071
Help your dad
with some more unfinished business.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.241
That contract was the last thing
holding him back.

40:11.659 --> 40:12.535
From what?

40:14.829 --> 40:16.455
I'm gonna run for mayor.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.708
Against the Lodges. Come what may.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.344
Mrs. Blossom, hi.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.098
I'm looking for Cheryl. She wasn't
at the hospital with her nana.

40:34.181 --> 40:37.059
No, she's gone.
Boarding school in Switzerland.

40:37.643 --> 40:39.854
All girls. She left just last night.

40:39.937 --> 40:43.482
Mrs. Blossom,
that doesn't make any sense.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.067
Don't come here again.

41:18.017 --> 41:22.438
Oh, you poor child.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

41:24.523 --> 41:28.861
-Sister Woodhouse is going to help you.
-Thank you, Sister Woodhouse.

41:29.778 --> 41:33.532
Yes, she's going to rid you
of all those naughty demons.

41:35.576 --> 41:39.288
The ones making you think
such awful, unnatural thoughts.

41:42.458 --> 41:43.918
Today, you must rest.

41:46.086 --> 41:49.089
Tomorrow, the real work...
