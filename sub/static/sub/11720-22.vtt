Swallow.

Open your mouth.

Have a nice day.

01:02.141 --> 01:04.507
You, too.

There he is, we got him.

02:56.922 --> 02:58.522
Seriously?
This is embarrassing.

02:58.524 --> 03:00.491
Here we go.
Something better than a clown car?

03:00.493 --> 03:01.826
You couldn't have
gotten something bigger?

03:01.828 --> 03:03.160
The guy shot
our tires out, Danny.

03:03.162 --> 03:05.396
I didn't have time
to go car shopping.

03:05.398 --> 03:06.831
So I took what
was available.

03:06.833 --> 03:09.033

Oh, whoa!

Hey!

All right, all right!

Hey!

Relax. 
Relax? Relax!

03:27.220 --> 03:29.520
I'm gonna die
in a clown car.

03:31.656 --> 03:34.525
You got no room
on the right. Hey!

03:39.799 --> 03:42.399
This is great. After all that
now you're gonna lose him?

03:46.438 --> 03:47.872
Okay.

03:47.874 --> 03:50.174
Can you please just keep two of
the three wheels on the ground?

03:50.176 --> 03:52.309
How many times have I told you:
You don't like the way I drive,

03:52.311 --> 03:54.044
you can get out of the car anytime.
I would love

03:54.046 --> 03:55.053
to get out of the car.
There are no doors.

03:55.078 --> 03:56.014
Duck.
What?

03:56.015 --> 03:58.249
Duck!

04:01.887 --> 04:03.654
Get out of the car.

04:03.656 --> 04:06.023
Out of the car,
right now.

04:06.025 --> 04:06.957
Get on your knees.
Hands,

04:06.959 --> 04:09.293
hands up.
Do it. Now.

04:09.295 --> 04:10.561
Don't even think about it.

04:10.563 --> 04:11.629
There's two ways this can go,

04:11.631 --> 04:13.831
and in both you end up dead.

04:13.833 --> 04:16.065
You know, that doe't
make any sense.

04:16.067 --> 04:18.235
But it sounded good, right?

04:18.237 --> 04:21.071
Get on your knees. Let's go.

04:26.211 --> 04:28.379
Duke Lukela, meet
Henry Dunbar,

04:28.381 --> 04:29.413
the serial bank robber

04:29.415 --> 04:30.714
you guys have
been looking for

04:30.716 --> 04:32.783
for awhile now.
He's all yours.

04:33.686 --> 04:34.785
Get him out
of here.

04:34.787 --> 04:37.821
Hey.

04:37.823 --> 04:39.290
We got a problem.

04:39.292 --> 04:40.958
Wo Fat's escaped.

04:42.894 --> 04:44.328
Oh, that's funny, you see,

04:44.330 --> 04:46.063
what I thought you said
is that Wo Fat escaped,

04:46.065 --> 04:47.298
which would be
impossible because he's in

04:47.300 --> 04:49.066
a supermax in Colorado
and everybody knows

04:49.068 --> 04:50.367
you can't escape
from those places.

04:50.369 --> 04:51.802
Another myth
bites the dust.

04:51.804 --> 04:53.070
How? What happened?

04:53.072 --> 04:55.039
Wo Fat was taking nitroglycerine
for a heart condition

04:55.041 --> 04:57.341
induced by the helo crash trauma
that he suffered last year.

04:57.343 --> 04:59.310
Well, he was actually
stashing most of the doses.

04:59.312 --> 05:00.711
Which he then
cocktailed

05:00.713 --> 05:02.580
with paint thinner and
fertilizer that he picked up

05:02.582 --> 05:04.448
from the prison yard
to make an ANFO bomb.

05:04.450 --> 05:06.517
Strong enough to blow a hole
in his cell wall.

05:06.519 --> 05:09.119
But I wouldn't put it past him
that he had help.

05:23.602 --> 05:25.803
Aloha.

05:26.538 --> 05:28.305
Oh, Samantha.

05:28.307 --> 05:30.574
Oh, look like you got
stood up, brah.

05:30.576 --> 05:32.743
Oh, no, she'll be here.
One thing about my daughter

05:32.745 --> 05:35.045
Samantha, she's...
sort of punctual.

05:35.047 --> 05:36.280
Well,

05:36.282 --> 05:37.348
if she doesn't show,

05:37.350 --> 05:39.283
and you need a hand
with the shrimp plates,

05:39.285 --> 05:40.951
my cousin Flippa,

05:40.953 --> 05:42.786
he got a lunch break coming up.

05:42.788 --> 05:45.222
Thanks, but, uh, she'll show.

05:45.224 --> 05:47.524
Just in case,
I'll have him on standby.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.761
Howzit?

05:56.001 --> 05:57.301
Little girl, where are you?

05:57.303 --> 05:59.637
Daddy, I'm sorry,
I should have called earlier,

05:59.639 --> 06:01.005
but I can't make it to lunch.

06:01.007 --> 06:02.506
What do you mean
you can't make it?

06:02.508 --> 06:03.774
What's the matter?
Everything all right?

06:03.776 --> 06:04.875
Everything's fine.

06:04.877 --> 06:06.510
I just need to finish my
history assignment

06:06.512 --> 06:09.246
and need to stay in the library
a few more hours.

06:09.248 --> 06:10.447
Don't be angry.

06:10.449 --> 06:11.615
I'm not angry, sweetheart.

06:11.617 --> 06:13.851
I'm glad you got
your priorities straight.

06:16.522 --> 06:18.989
Stop, I'm on the phone.

06:18.991 --> 06:21.025
Samantha, where are you?

06:21.027 --> 06:22.693
I told you, I'm in the library.

06:22.695 --> 06:23.894
Don't lie to me, Samantha.

06:23.896 --> 06:25.129
Dad, I'm not lying.

06:25.131 --> 06:26.297
Let me talk to him.

06:26.299 --> 06:27.731
No. just give me a second.

06:27.733 --> 06:30.567
Samantha, who is that?

06:30.569 --> 06:33.137
Just a friend
I met in the library.

06:33.139 --> 06:34.371
A friend you m...

06:34.373 --> 06:36.006
You know,
you should really learn

06:36.008 --> 06:37.408
to trust your daughter more.

06:37.410 --> 06:40.411
Boy, I don't know who
you think you're talking to...

06:40.413 --> 06:42.646
Look, I'm just saying, all
right? You got a good girl here.

06:42.648 --> 06:45.115
She's awfully cute, too.
All right, who the hell is this?

06:45.117 --> 06:48.452
Really? You don't
recognize my voice?

06:48.454 --> 06:50.487
I'm seriously bummed, dude.

06:50.489 --> 06:51.689
Let me help you out.

06:55.260 --> 06:57.428
<i>You just need</i>
<i>to stop this</i>

06:57.430 --> 06:58.762
<i>and we'll try to make a deal.</i>

06:58.764 --> 07:00.497
A deal?

07:00.499 --> 07:02.866
I've committed acts of treason,
there won't be any deals.

07:04.270 --> 07:05.903
Where's the other computer, Ian?
Put me on that plane

07:05.905 --> 07:08.405
or 300 people are gonna die.

07:14.646 --> 07:16.213
Let me talk to my daughter.

07:16.215 --> 07:18.382
Oh, whatever you say, Pops.

07:21.119 --> 07:22.753
Daddy, what's going on?

07:23.788 --> 07:25.022
Samantha,

07:25.024 --> 07:27.291
honey, I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

07:27.293 --> 07:30.694
The man that you're with
is a very dangerous fugitive.

07:30.696 --> 07:32.763
Now, he's gonna
want to hurt you...

07:32.765 --> 07:35.699
Daddy, I'm scared.

07:35.701 --> 07:37.835
Now-Now I know you're scared,

07:37.837 --> 07:40.070
but I need you to be strong.

07:40.072 --> 07:42.973
I'm gonna find you.
I promise you.

07:42.975 --> 07:44.039
I'm gonna find you.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.377
Now you got her all
freaked out. All right?

07:45.378 --> 07:46.910
That's not going to
help this thing at all.

07:46.912 --> 07:49.079
You little son of a bitch.
What do you want?

07:49.081 --> 07:51.181
Stay close to your phone,
I'll be in touch.

07:51.183 --> 07:53.450
And obviously, this
stays between us.

07:53.452 --> 07:55.686
Tell any of your cop
buddies about this,

07:55.688 --> 07:57.287
and you'll be using your
daughter's college fund

07:57.289 --> 07:58.555
to pay for a funeral.

07:58.557 --> 07:59.623
No, please...

08:58.833 --> 09:01.569
All right, all right.

09:02.171 --> 09:04.771
Okay.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.381
Hey, Lou.

09:14.383 --> 09:16.416
Hello?

09:25.860 --> 09:28.829
After the beep,
you know what to do.

09:28.831 --> 09:30.731
What's up?

09:30.733 --> 09:33.333
Went straight to voice mail.

09:33.335 --> 09:36.637
I just got off the phone with
the prison warden in Colorado.

09:36.639 --> 09:38.138
Steve, you might
want to sit down for this.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.306
Why?

09:39.308 --> 09:40.841
Wo Fat only had one visitor

09:40.843 --> 09:42.242
when he was over there...

09:42.244 --> 09:43.310
guess who it was?

09:43.312 --> 09:44.878
My mother.

09:44.880 --> 09:48.081
She went to visit him
twice in the last month.

09:49.851 --> 09:51.451
Wow.

09:51.453 --> 09:54.221
I'm going to sit down, actually.

09:54.223 --> 09:56.490
Were the visits recorded?
No.

09:56.492 --> 09:59.226
Apparently the sit-downs were
sanctioned by someone in the DoD

09:59.228 --> 10:00.594
and they were ordered
nonmonitored visits.

10:00.596 --> 10:02.229
Let me get
this straight:

10:02.231 --> 10:04.631
In the year that
your mother's disappeared,

10:04.633 --> 10:05.799
she decides
to go

10:05.801 --> 10:07.434
see this nut job instead
of her own son.

10:07.436 --> 10:09.069
You actually need this couch
more than me.

10:09.071 --> 10:10.904
Why don't you sit down.

10:10.906 --> 10:13.094
This is all about Wo Fat's
mother's grave in Cambodia.

10:13.119 --> 10:14.475
Why do you say that?

10:14.476 --> 10:16.476
Two visits in the last month?
That's right on the heels

10:16.478 --> 10:18.679
of our trip to Cambodia.
Doris must have found out

10:18.681 --> 10:20.647
we went there and discovered
the truth. I'm telling you,

10:20.649 --> 10:22.216
she must have found out
that she killed his mother

10:22.218 --> 10:24.117
instead of his father.
And if that's true,

10:24.119 --> 10:25.452
maybe Wo Fat escaped
to find him.

10:25.454 --> 10:27.487
Hey, guys,
you need to see this.

10:29.190 --> 10:31.458
Got a positive ID on
Wo Fat from four hours ago.

10:31.460 --> 10:34.328
This was taken at a gas station
near Colorado Springs.

10:37.832 --> 10:39.833
The driver was DOA
at the hospital.

10:39.835 --> 10:41.101
State patrol
has set up check points,

10:41.103 --> 10:43.604
and the local PD are conducting
a hard-target search

10:43.606 --> 10:45.572
- of every residence in the area.
- It's a waste of time.

10:45.574 --> 10:47.541
Wo Fat's not sticking around.
Plus, he's got a car.

10:47.543 --> 10:49.443
He's getting as far away
from there as possible.

10:50.746 --> 10:52.446
Yes, Governor.

10:53.581 --> 10:55.882
Yeah, I'm on my way.

11:00.488 --> 11:02.522
Hey, honey.

11:02.524 --> 11:04.725
How was lunch?

11:06.060 --> 11:08.028
It was good.
Good.

11:08.030 --> 11:10.097
So, did you have
the conversation?

11:10.099 --> 11:11.298
Well, yeah.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.799
And?

11:12.801 --> 11:15.335
And I told her that
if she didn't buckle down,

11:15.337 --> 11:17.738
she was going to end up going
to summer school,

11:17.740 --> 11:19.172
and it wasn't up
for negotiation.

11:19.174 --> 11:21.074
Oh. How'd she respond?

11:21.076 --> 11:22.509
Well, how do you think
she responded?

11:22.511 --> 11:24.611
She gave me the pouty face,
and then I gave her the look,

11:24.613 --> 11:26.546
and believe me,
she got the message.

11:28.182 --> 11:29.783
Mmm.
See?

11:29.785 --> 11:32.474
You can be bad cop
when you want to.

11:32.499 --> 11:33.021
Mm.

11:33.022 --> 11:34.288
Yeah.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.522
Hey, are you
feeling okay?

11:35.524 --> 11:37.457
You're a little clammy.

11:37.459 --> 11:38.625
No, I'm good. I'm good.

11:38.627 --> 11:40.694
Listen, sweetheart, I got
to take care of something.

11:40.696 --> 11:42.729
Let's talk later.
Okay.

11:42.731 --> 11:44.431
Okay, baby.
Well, I love you.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.066
Love you, too.

12:09.591 --> 12:12.125
Lou, you got a visitor.

12:12.127 --> 12:13.760
Be there in a minute.

12:18.399 --> 12:20.014
McGarrett?

12:20.015 --> 12:20.646
Hey.

12:20.671 --> 12:22.670
What are you doing here?
Your phone broke?

12:22.671 --> 12:25.172
That's funny, 'cause I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

12:25.174 --> 12:26.473
What are you talking about?

12:26.475 --> 12:28.046
Well, you called me,
then hung up on me.

12:28.071 --> 12:28.710
Oh.

12:28.711 --> 12:31.345
It must have just
been an ass-dial.

12:31.347 --> 12:34.514
Must happen a lot
with a guy your size.

12:34.516 --> 12:36.483
As much as I'd like
to stand here

12:36.485 --> 12:38.151
and let you take shots at me,

12:38.153 --> 12:39.853
I'm kind of busy.
You okay?

12:39.855 --> 12:42.689
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why are you here?

12:42.691 --> 12:46.126
Governor's put Five-O
on a security detail.

12:46.128 --> 12:47.461
I could use your help.

12:47.463 --> 12:48.595
All right. What kind of help?

12:48.597 --> 12:50.063
We got a government
transport

12:50.065 --> 12:52.099
flying in to pick up
a large amount of cash.

12:52.101 --> 12:53.367
Need some SWAT backup.

12:53.369 --> 12:55.202
Well, sure,
I can spare some guys.

12:55.204 --> 12:57.437
Thank you.

12:58.773 --> 13:00.774
Why don't you go
ahead and take it?

13:00.776 --> 13:02.242
I'll, uh... I'll text
you the particulars.

13:02.244 --> 13:03.677
All right.

13:10.785 --> 13:11.952
Yeah. Hello?

13:11.954 --> 13:13.220
Little slow
on the pick-up there, boss.

13:13.222 --> 13:15.956
Sorry. But I'm here now.
Just tell me

13:15.958 --> 13:17.457
what you want.

13:17.459 --> 13:18.825
Okay, here's what you're gonna
do. You're gonna drive

13:18.827 --> 13:21.061
a fully-loaded SWAT van
out to Kahana Bay

13:21.063 --> 13:23.230
with six SWAT uniforms--
four large, two mediums.

13:23.232 --> 13:26.233
All right, and throw in some of
that nice, shiny tac gear, too.

13:26.235 --> 13:29.069
Weapons, extra ammo
and credentials.

13:29.071 --> 13:30.737
All right, hold on.

13:30.739 --> 13:32.272
Now, you listen to me.

13:32.274 --> 13:35.342
I'm not doing a thing
until I talk to Samantha.

13:40.348 --> 13:42.382
It's your daddy.

13:43.819 --> 13:45.018
Daddy?

13:45.020 --> 13:46.019
I'm here, suge.

13:46.021 --> 13:47.354
I want to go home.

13:47.356 --> 13:48.822
You will, I promise.

13:48.824 --> 13:50.257
But until then, I need you

13:50.259 --> 13:52.592
to just hang in there for me.
You hear me?

13:52.594 --> 13:53.860
I need you to be strong.

13:55.063 --> 13:56.463
Is that good enough for you?

13:56.465 --> 13:57.664
Kahana Bay?

13:57.666 --> 13:58.732
You got one hour.

14:15.082 --> 14:17.050
Agent Novak,

14:17.052 --> 14:18.385
what are we looking at here?

14:18.387 --> 14:20.353
One hundred million.

14:20.355 --> 14:21.521
Who does it belong to?

14:21.523 --> 14:22.389
It's ghost money.

14:22.391 --> 14:23.590
Confiscated assets

14:23.592 --> 14:25.592
from a drug cartel
that's being repurposed

14:25.594 --> 14:27.461
to fund third
world development.

14:27.463 --> 14:29.763
Ghost money.
I don't speak spy. What is that?

14:29.765 --> 14:31.698
There might be a lot of people
who hate this country,

14:31.700 --> 14:32.866
but nobody hates our cash.

14:32.868 --> 14:34.301
$100 million.

14:34.303 --> 14:35.702
That's a lot of diplomacy.

14:35.704 --> 14:37.237
All right, we got wheels down

14:37.239 --> 14:38.705
on that transport in one hour.

14:38.707 --> 14:40.874
Where's your back-up?
I got SWAT posted outside.

14:40.876 --> 14:42.275
Good. Brief them
on the route.

14:42.277 --> 14:44.377
In the meantime, I'll have
my guys get this loaded.

14:44.379 --> 14:46.379
Roger that.

15:16.578 --> 15:18.512
Come on.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.481
I got everything you wanted.

15:21.483 --> 15:22.883
Devoted father like you,

15:22.885 --> 15:24.184
I never doubted it for a second.

15:24.186 --> 15:26.987
All right, Ian, I did everything
you asked me to do.

15:26.989 --> 15:29.189
Now, please...

15:29.191 --> 15:31.157
let Samantha go now.

15:31.159 --> 15:33.627
Slow down, Pops.
We're not done yet.

15:33.629 --> 15:35.662
What are you talking about?
Turn around.

15:35.664 --> 15:37.364
You see that truck
coming your way?

15:37.366 --> 15:39.466
What about it?

15:39.468 --> 15:40.901
You're going to give those men
inside that vehicle

15:40.903 --> 15:43.103
the uniforms, weapons
and credentials.

15:43.105 --> 15:44.704
And then what?

15:44.706 --> 15:47.374
Then you're going
to help them steal $100 million.

16:02.897 --> 16:05.265
Yeah, okay, just
keep me posted.

16:05.267 --> 16:06.599
Mahalo.

16:06.601 --> 16:08.134
What's up?

16:08.136 --> 16:09.836
Wo Fat is still in the wind.

16:09.838 --> 16:12.806
Why don't you call your mom,
ask her where he is?

16:13.874 --> 16:16.009
You realize that hurts
me when you say that?

16:16.011 --> 16:17.911
I-I didn't mean
to hurt you. I'm sorry.

16:17.913 --> 16:19.846
I was literally just
trying to be helpful.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.648
I mean, I know you can't even
get in touch with her anyway.

16:21.650 --> 16:23.750
She avoids you like crazy.
Stop being helpful!

16:23.752 --> 16:25.318
Okay?
Okay.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.920
Sorry.

16:26.922 --> 16:28.488
Thank you.

16:28.490 --> 16:31.524
Well, uh, speaking
of, uh, missing persons,

16:31.526 --> 16:33.293
you talk to Catherine at all?

16:33.295 --> 16:34.527
You being genuine?
Yes.

16:34.529 --> 16:35.929
Okay, yes, I have, actually.

16:35.931 --> 16:37.430
We texted
last night.

16:37.432 --> 16:39.899
She has a solid lead
on Najib's whereabouts,

16:39.901 --> 16:41.801
and she's headed
to the Hindu Kush.

16:41.803 --> 16:44.637
Doesn't sound like
she's coming back any time soon.

16:44.639 --> 16:47.607
Probably not till
she finds that boy.

16:47.609 --> 16:50.643
I'm genuinely sorry.
I know that that is tough.

16:50.645 --> 16:53.313
Thanks, man.

16:54.715 --> 16:56.616
Yeah, it's tough,

16:56.618 --> 16:58.284
but, uh...
but I get it.

16:58.286 --> 17:00.286
Catherine's been
in the military half her life.

17:00.288 --> 17:02.522
She's doing
what she was trained to do.

17:03.557 --> 17:05.558
She's not coming home

17:05.560 --> 17:07.794
until the job is done.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.768
Everything okay?

17:15.770 --> 17:18.037
You've been
quiet all day.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.410
am brought up
the M-word last night.

17:24.412 --> 17:27.280
What did you say?

17:27.281 --> 17:29.215
He didn't officially propose.

17:29.217 --> 17:30.884
Just wondering

17:30.886 --> 17:32.252
would I consider it.

17:32.254 --> 17:33.553
And would you?

17:33.555 --> 17:35.855
I love him.

17:35.857 --> 17:38.091
And I want to have
a family with him.

17:38.093 --> 17:41.427
I just don't know
if I want it now.

17:44.331 --> 17:47.000
You know, one
of my biggest regret about Malia

17:47.002 --> 17:50.637
is that I didn't ask
her to marry me sooner.

17:50.639 --> 17:53.072
This life we live...

17:53.074 --> 17:56.676
it's unpredictable.

17:58.646 --> 18:01.581
I say, if it feels right,
there's no reason to wait.

18:19.700 --> 18:22.068
Anybody gonna tell me
what the plan is?

18:22.070 --> 18:25.438
The plan is that you follow
our lead and shut up.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.408
Then maybe you and your kid get
to walk away.

18:28.410 --> 18:30.176
Okay.

18:30.178 --> 18:33.112
So just to be clear,

18:33.114 --> 18:36.115
anything happens to my daughter,
I'm going to kill you.

18:36.117 --> 18:37.951
Then I'm going to find
everything you love,

18:37.953 --> 18:39.752
and I'm gonna kill that, too.

18:41.088 --> 18:41.988
Ooh!

18:43.825 --> 18:46.559
Load up. We got 20 minutes.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.811
In case you get hungry.

19:07.815 --> 19:10.917
Don't go anywhere, princess.

19:22.963 --> 19:25.631
Bravo 158, proceed

19:25.633 --> 19:27.367
to 2383 North King Street.

19:27.369 --> 19:31.104
Reported burglary,
158 responding, 10-4.

19:51.325 --> 19:53.726
Sarge.
Lock down baggage claim.

19:55.129 --> 19:56.996
Cut him off outside!

20:13.981 --> 20:15.448
Over here!

20:15.450 --> 20:16.930
It's the backpack
the kid was wearing.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.485
Notify the airport manager.

20:19.487 --> 20:20.753
We may have a
bomb threat.

20:25.626 --> 20:27.460
All central units
to Honolulu International.

20:27.462 --> 20:30.530
Suspicious package found in
Terminal 3 rear baggage area.

20:30.532 --> 20:34.167
Airport evac
and lockdown in progress.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.371
This is SWAT, 10-4, proceeding.

20:38.373 --> 20:40.573
ETA, approximately
three minutes.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.385
<i>Everybody listen up.</i>
<i>There's been</i>

20:52.387 --> 20:53.386
an incident in Terminal 3.

20:53.388 --> 20:54.320
The airport is being evacuated.

20:54.322 --> 20:55.321
We need to load
that money right now

20:55.323 --> 20:57.256
<i>before the runways</i>
<i>are shut down.</i>

20:57.258 --> 20:59.325
Everybody maintain
situational awareness,

20:59.327 --> 21:00.660
in case this is
no coincidence.

21:00.662 --> 21:02.395
Copy that.

21:27.054 --> 21:28.254
Hey.

21:28.256 --> 21:29.956
Get your head right.

21:29.958 --> 21:32.592
Your daughter's life
depends on it.

22:00.954 --> 22:03.489
- Put your weapons down! Down! Down!
- Hey, hey, hey!

22:03.491 --> 22:05.291
What the hell is going on?
There's no bomb threat.

22:05.293 --> 22:07.193
That's just a diversion
to get at that truck.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.495
Story time's over.
Get their weapons.

22:10.631 --> 22:12.965
I'm sorry, Steve.
It's got to be this way.

22:15.302 --> 22:18.171
Where is it?
What are you talking about?

22:18.173 --> 22:20.673
What am I talking about?

22:24.478 --> 22:26.012
Where's the money?

22:26.014 --> 22:28.014
I don't know.

22:35.086 --> 22:37.833
That money didn't
just disappear! So where is it!

22:37.834 --> 22:38.540
You keep asking me

22:38.541 --> 22:40.641
the same question, it's the
same answer: I don't know.

22:40.643 --> 22:42.810
The last time we saw it,
it was in this truck.

22:42.812 --> 22:43.877
Now, that's the truth.

22:43.879 --> 22:45.412
Hey, listen, we were

22:45.414 --> 22:47.815
briefing SWAT when that money
was getting loaded in that van.

22:47.817 --> 22:49.550
Novak had plenty of time
to do something shady.

22:49.552 --> 22:52.319
- We wouldn't know about it, all right?
- You're lying.

22:52.321 --> 22:53.687
And I'm done asking!

22:53.689 --> 22:56.423
You got three seconds
to tell me where that money is.

22:56.425 --> 22:59.793
One... two...

23:13.675 --> 23:16.710
Man, I'm sorry--
they got my daughter.

23:17.412 --> 23:19.279
Who has your daughter?

23:19.281 --> 23:21.181
Ian Wright.
What?!

23:21.183 --> 23:23.116
That hacker kid who
disappeared six months ago?

23:23.118 --> 23:25.652
That's right.
Are you sure it's him?

23:25.654 --> 23:27.120
He sent this to me

23:27.122 --> 23:28.088
from my daughter's phone.

23:28.090 --> 23:29.590
And that money

23:29.592 --> 23:32.926
is the only thing
keeping my daughter alive!

23:35.397 --> 23:37.764
That's him.

23:37.766 --> 23:38.732
Answer it.

23:39.869 --> 23:41.034
I can't.

23:41.036 --> 23:43.203
Take the call--
buy yourself some time,

23:43.205 --> 23:44.271
okay?

23:44.273 --> 23:46.039
Please?

23:46.041 --> 23:47.307
Yeah?

23:47.309 --> 23:49.243
What happened?

23:49.245 --> 23:50.477
Nothing happened.

23:50.479 --> 23:52.679
I'm getting your money
just like you asked.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.549
Did I also tell you to kill
the six guys I sent to help you?

23:55.551 --> 23:56.717
He can see us.

23:56.719 --> 23:59.152
Look, your guys panicked!

23:59.154 --> 24:01.098
They got anxious,
and things got out of hand.

24:01.123 --> 24:01.756
Shut up!

24:01.757 --> 24:04.291
I don't care about them.
Where's my money?

24:04.293 --> 24:05.826
The money's not here.

24:05.828 --> 24:07.561
Okay, then where is it?

24:07.563 --> 24:10.197
How would I know that, Ian?
I don't know!

24:10.199 --> 24:12.466
You're seeing what I'm seeing.

24:12.468 --> 24:15.302
There is no money in the truck!

24:19.007 --> 24:20.240
Ian.

24:20.242 --> 24:21.909
Commander McGarrett.

24:21.911 --> 24:23.744
So nice to hear
your voice again.

24:23.746 --> 24:25.145
Ian, let Samantha go.

24:25.147 --> 24:26.413
You want a hostage,
come take me.

24:26.415 --> 24:29.116
That is so gallant of you.

24:29.118 --> 24:31.919
But no, thanks, I think
I'll stick to my original plan.

24:31.921 --> 24:35.055
Besides, she's
a lot cuter than you.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.457
Ian, listen to me,
the money's gone.

24:37.459 --> 24:38.759
It's all over.

24:38.761 --> 24:40.494
It's over when I have my money.

24:40.496 --> 24:43.063
So I suggest you find it.

24:44.332 --> 24:47.000
I called Novak three times;
he's not picking up.

24:47.002 --> 24:48.635
We find Novak,

24:48.637 --> 24:50.137
we find that money.

25:04.485 --> 25:05.585
Clear!

25:05.587 --> 25:08.055
Clear!

25:08.057 --> 25:10.223
So he checked out without
telling the front desk.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.093
Kono.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.028
Yeah, what do you got?
Novak rented

25:15.030 --> 25:16.163
a panel van two days ago.

25:16.165 --> 25:17.831
He signed the paperwork
using an alias

25:17.833 --> 25:20.033
from his days as a DoD operative.
Panel van?

25:20.035 --> 25:21.535
Plenty of room to stash

25:21.537 --> 25:23.503
a hundred million
in a panel van.

25:23.505 --> 25:25.272
But there's a silver lining,
'cause the rental car company

25:25.274 --> 25:26.340
has an anti-theft device

25:26.342 --> 25:28.842
on the truck,
which I'm activating now.

25:28.844 --> 25:31.211
Got it.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.547
Stay on Pu'uhale,

25:33.549 --> 25:34.848
take a left on Auiki,

25:34.850 --> 25:36.116
then take a sharp left

25:36.118 --> 25:37.617
onto Sand Island Access Road.

25:37.619 --> 25:38.785
Make a left.
Make a left.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.053
The vehicle is stationary.

25:40.055 --> 25:41.989
Address is 1610.

25:53.234 --> 25:56.136
Kono, we got Novak's van.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.204
Come on.

25:57.206 --> 25:59.206
Go.

26:10.218 --> 26:11.351
It's not over.

26:11.353 --> 26:13.453
It's not?
You see any money in there?

26:13.455 --> 26:14.588
Because I don't!

26:14.590 --> 26:15.889
And without
that money,

26:15.891 --> 26:18.725
my daughter is
just as od as dead!

26:20.995 --> 26:22.796
Aw!

26:44.887 --> 26:48.088
Oh, God, she's just a baby.

26:50.425 --> 26:54.061
I'm-I'm so sorry, Samantha.

27:20.888 --> 27:23.490
Listen to me.

27:25.493 --> 27:26.960
A few years ago, uh,

27:26.962 --> 27:29.896
this guy that I thought I
knew, he took my daughter.

27:32.967 --> 27:35.769
And, uh... you know,
I remember back then

27:35.771 --> 27:37.704
thinking I got
two choices now.

27:37.706 --> 27:39.806
I can, uh,
I can shut down,

27:39.808 --> 27:42.275
start mourning
my daughter,

27:42.277 --> 27:45.045
or I could do anything
and everything it took

27:45.047 --> 27:48.982
to run over whatever stood in
my way to get my daughter back.

27:53.121 --> 27:55.422
I can't stop thinking about her.

27:55.424 --> 27:58.825
I can't stop thinking about
what she must be going through.

27:58.827 --> 28:01.328
Right now you need
to put that on hold.

28:01.330 --> 28:05.232
If you want to see Samantha,
you stay focused on ending

28:05.234 --> 28:07.000
this son of a bitch.

28:09.303 --> 28:10.770
You understand?

28:10.772 --> 28:12.005
Yeah.

28:12.007 --> 28:13.773
Let's go get this
guy. Come on.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.742
Yeah, let's get him.
Let's go.

28:15.744 --> 28:17.010
<i>Here we go.</i>

28:17.012 --> 28:19.112
This is every traffic cam
in the area

28:19.114 --> 28:21.448
that we found Novak's van.
All right, let's rewind them.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.183
Novak had to have moved
that pallet of money into

28:23.185 --> 28:25.003
another truck-- let's
see if we can find it.

28:25.028 --> 28:26.120
All right, I just

28:26.121 --> 28:28.421
spoke to Novak's supervisor
at the Pentagon-- he hasn't

28:28.423 --> 28:30.090
checked in since
he landed on the island.

28:30.092 --> 28:31.858
He's too busy
stealing all that cash.

28:31.860 --> 28:33.760
I had his bank accounts frozen,
and his family's under watch.

28:33.762 --> 28:34.928
So, how does a lone

28:34.930 --> 28:36.696
DoD bureaucrat from the
mainland physically move

28:36.698 --> 28:39.032
a hundred million dollars?
He had to have help.

28:39.034 --> 28:41.368
Sorry, Commander.
He said you were expecting him.

28:45.740 --> 28:49.609
You son of a bitch, come here.

28:49.611 --> 28:51.278
Where the hell is my daughter?

28:51.280 --> 28:53.580
Are you asking me if she's
alive, or where she is?

28:53.582 --> 28:55.248
Because you know
I'm not gonna tell you that.

28:55.250 --> 28:58.585
Hey, hey, hey.
Samantha's alive, Lou.

28:58.587 --> 28:59.753
She's the only leverage
he's got.

28:59.755 --> 29:01.454
That's why you're the boss.

29:03.525 --> 29:05.392
Get up.
You still got it.

29:05.394 --> 29:07.661
What are you doing here?
You guys like the Beatles?

29:08.729 --> 29:10.730
I do. My dad
turned me on to them.

29:10.732 --> 29:12.098
Kind of primitive
for my generation,

29:12.100 --> 29:14.367
but they got some good tunes.
What's that got

29:14.369 --> 29:18.071
to do with anything?
John, Paul, George, Ringo.

29:18.073 --> 29:20.907
Arguably the best rock band
in rock and roll history.

29:20.909 --> 29:22.342
Kind of like you guys, right?

29:22.344 --> 29:24.744
You're, like, the best cops
in the world. Five-O.

29:24.746 --> 29:26.379
But with the Beatles,
there was this guy,

29:26.381 --> 29:29.216
the power behind the throne,
Brian Epstein,

29:29.218 --> 29:30.784
who, by all accounts,

29:30.786 --> 29:32.285
was the fifth Beatle.

29:32.287 --> 29:34.688
That's who I am today.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.057
I'm your Brian Epstein.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.693
You better start
making sense,

29:39.695 --> 29:41.161
or I'm putting
a hole in you.

29:41.163 --> 29:43.364
- All right, I know where my money is.
- Where is it?

29:43.365 --> 29:46.566
- The Makuakane Family has it.
- How do you know that?

29:46.568 --> 29:48.301
Well, when I realized Novak
used you as a diversion,

29:48.303 --> 29:50.670
I ran his name in a key search,
got back a series

29:50.672 --> 29:54.107
of encrypted e-mail exchanges between
him and members of the Makuakane Family.

29:54.109 --> 29:56.943
- Who are these guys?
- Local Samoan cartel

29:56.945 --> 29:58.478
run by Inoke Makuakane.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.647
Heavy in the ice trade.
Everyone in his crew

30:00.649 --> 30:02.983
gets his wings in California,
which is the equivalent

30:02.985 --> 30:04.451
of SEAL training
for gangbangers.

30:04.453 --> 30:06.419
That's got to be how
Novak's getting himself

30:06.421 --> 30:07.358
and the money off
the island--

30:07.383 --> 30:08.556
using their
smuggling infrastructure.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.790
Yeah, the problem is,
these guys have been on the radar

30:10.792 --> 30:12.826
for years, and no one's been able
to touch them.

30:12.828 --> 30:15.061
Which is why I suggest you use
all the collective brain power

30:15.063 --> 30:16.363
in this room to figure it out.

30:16.365 --> 30:17.998
Because the clock is ticking.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.835
Oh, and by the way,

30:21.837 --> 30:23.503
I already jammed
all the surveillance cameras

30:23.505 --> 30:26.706
in the area, so if you try
to follow me some other way,

30:26.708 --> 30:28.975
you'll never find your daughter.

30:40.045 --> 30:41.880
This is from
the latest satellite pass

30:41.882 --> 30:44.115
over the Makuakane
'ohana compound.

30:44.117 --> 30:46.518
There are ten-foot walls
around the entire perimeter,

30:46.520 --> 30:49.154
armed guards, CCTV--
it's a fortress.

30:49.156 --> 30:51.489
All right, do we know
how many people are in there?

30:51.491 --> 30:52.657
Several families, at least.

30:52.659 --> 30:54.325
That's a lot of collateral.

30:54.327 --> 30:55.927
Well, how do we get in there?

30:55.929 --> 30:58.196
Without making
a lot of noise, we don't.

30:59.365 --> 31:02.433
We can't get a warrant
without probable cause.

31:02.435 --> 31:04.235
Besides, it would expose
the kidnapping

31:04.237 --> 31:06.871
- and put Samantha in a bad spot.
- Yeah. I've had

31:06.873 --> 31:09.107
run-ins with this family before,
and if we go in hot,

31:09.109 --> 31:10.942
it's gonna get bloody.

31:10.944 --> 31:13.444
I get it, it's risky.

31:17.816 --> 31:20.084
Look...

31:20.086 --> 31:21.819
none of you have to do this.

31:21.821 --> 31:24.756
It's not your problem, it's
my problem, it's my daughter.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.691
I don't have any
expectations

31:26.693 --> 31:28.226
of anybody here.

31:28.228 --> 31:30.728
And if I have to,
I'll just go in there alone.

31:30.730 --> 31:32.263
No, are you kidding me?

31:32.265 --> 31:34.332
He loves this stuff.
He lives for it.

31:35.467 --> 31:38.169
The only way we
do this is together.

31:58.857 --> 32:01.192
This is private property.

32:01.194 --> 32:02.927
Yeah,
I can see that.

32:02.929 --> 32:04.195
What do you want?

32:04.197 --> 32:05.730
I need to speak to Inoke.

32:05.732 --> 32:07.365
Not gonna happen.

32:07.367 --> 32:09.701
My bad, brah.

32:09.703 --> 32:12.470
I forgot to say <i>please.</i>

32:14.773 --> 32:16.040
Let's go.

32:16.042 --> 32:17.108
Hold it right there. Let him go.

32:17.110 --> 32:18.476
That's far enough.
Stop right there.

32:18.478 --> 32:21.813
Easy. Easy.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.848
I just want to talk to Inoke.

32:31.023 --> 32:33.391
You got any guns on you?

32:33.393 --> 32:35.560
No guns.

32:40.199 --> 32:42.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's a bomb!

32:42.602 --> 32:43.835
Come here.

32:45.871 --> 32:48.106
You asked me if I had any guns.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.074
Get them out of here.

32:50.076 --> 32:51.109
Let's go!

32:51.111 --> 32:52.977
Come on! Let's get them inside!

32:52.979 --> 32:54.112
Okay, you got
my attention.

32:54.114 --> 32:55.113
What do you want?

32:55.115 --> 32:56.281
I want that money that he stole

32:56.283 --> 32:57.615
that you're smuggling
off the island.

32:57.617 --> 32:59.550
I've never seen this guy before

32:59.552 --> 33:01.185
in my life.
How'd you know

33:01.187 --> 33:03.221
to come here?
It's got nothing to do with you.

33:03.223 --> 33:04.922
My daughter got snatched
this morning.

33:04.924 --> 33:07.191
I need that cash
to buy her back.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.893
And you're willing to
kill yourself if I don't

33:08.895 --> 33:11.095
give it to you?
She's my kid.

33:11.097 --> 33:13.765
And she's gonna die if I don't
bring that money back,

33:13.767 --> 33:15.800
so if I walk out of here
without it,

33:15.802 --> 33:17.635
my life's over anyway.

33:17.637 --> 33:19.137
It's your cash.

33:19.139 --> 33:20.204
It's your call.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.539
Even if you give
it back to him,

33:21.541 --> 33:22.740
I get my
ten percent

33:22.742 --> 33:23.975
no matter what.

33:23.977 --> 33:25.576
He's lying.
You think

33:25.578 --> 33:27.278
I'd come in here and drop
a story like that on you

33:27.280 --> 33:28.446
and not be for real?

33:28.448 --> 33:30.281
I think I know a bluff
when I see one.

33:30.283 --> 33:31.749
This ain't no bluff, partner.

33:31.751 --> 33:33.885
Then come on. Do it.
Take us out.

33:33.887 --> 33:35.720
You don't think I'll do it?!

33:35.722 --> 33:38.256
Then turn us all
into puzzle pieces.

33:41.660 --> 33:45.163
Do it.

34:03.816 --> 34:05.083
Wood.

34:05.684 --> 34:06.951
It's a fake. I told you.

34:07.586 --> 34:08.786
Make him disappear.

34:10.456 --> 34:11.489
You may want to rethink that.

34:11.491 --> 34:13.190
Wait...

34:13.193 --> 34:14.792
Drop your weapons!

34:26.804 --> 34:27.938
You set us up.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.806
Just doing what I had to do.

34:29.809 --> 34:31.309
I got a long memory, my friend.

34:31.311 --> 34:32.844
That's good. We can hook up
when you get out of jail.

34:32.846 --> 34:34.178
Now drop
your weapons

34:34.179 --> 34:36.380
before I have my friends
ventilate your ass.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.326
Let's go get
that money.

34:57.737 --> 35:00.271
I got the cash.
Show me.

35:08.180 --> 35:10.882
Hikina Ranch.
The old grass airstrip.

35:10.884 --> 35:12.116
I'll give you 30 minutes.

35:12.118 --> 35:14.385
Once I take delivery
and I feel safe,

35:14.387 --> 35:16.320
you'll get a call and I'll tell
you where your daughter is.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.855
I need proof of life.

35:17.857 --> 35:21.559
Sure. Say hello
to your daddy, princess!

35:26.365 --> 35:28.232
Hey.

35:28.234 --> 35:30.268
Talk to your father. He went
through a lot of trouble for you.

35:30.270 --> 35:32.003
Daddy, I want to go home.

35:32.005 --> 35:33.971
Sweetheart,
it's gonna be over soon,

35:33.973 --> 35:35.873
Please, I want to go home.
all right? I promise.

35:35.875 --> 35:37.041
Now you listen,

35:37.043 --> 35:38.242
you little son of a bitch,

35:38.244 --> 35:40.244
Hikina Ranch. 30 minutes.

35:40.246 --> 35:41.345
I'll be there with the money.

35:41.347 --> 35:42.380
Of course you will.

35:42.382 --> 35:44.348
See you soon.

35:47.352 --> 35:49.620
No hard feelings?

35:49.622 --> 35:52.356
My dad is gonna find you,
and he's going to kill you.

35:52.358 --> 35:53.658
You know that,
right?

35:53.660 --> 35:56.127
I like you.
Go to hell.

35:56.129 --> 35:57.195
One day.

35:57.197 --> 35:58.830
But right now

35:58.832 --> 36:02.066
I've got some serious cash
to burn through.

36:02.068 --> 36:04.702
Aloha.

36:15.914 --> 36:18.416
It's hard to believe
this guy's just running late.

36:18.418 --> 36:20.918
100 mil on the table,
he'll show.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.223
Yeah.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.757
What?

36:27.426 --> 36:28.593
Say again?

36:29.495 --> 36:31.295
And you're sure?

36:33.131 --> 36:35.333
Yeah, I got it.

36:37.436 --> 36:40.304
Samantha just walked
into an HPD precinct.

36:41.974 --> 36:44.008
And she said
that Ian Wright is dead.

37:26.151 --> 37:28.452
I got you. You're all right.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.521
You're all right.
You're all right now.

37:30.523 --> 37:33.090
I told you...

37:33.092 --> 37:36.327
Daddy always keeps his promises.

37:36.329 --> 37:38.095
All right, look now.

37:38.097 --> 37:39.797
I need you to
be a big girl.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.466
Tell me now, what
happened to Ian?

37:42.468 --> 37:43.834
A man shot him.

37:43.836 --> 37:45.736
It's all right.
All right, baby.

37:45.738 --> 37:48.372
What man?
I don't know.

37:55.981 --> 37:58.015
Can I help you?

38:43.362 --> 38:45.396
What do you want?

38:46.231 --> 38:48.532
<i>Did he say anything to you?</i>

38:51.204 --> 38:53.671
He wanted me
to give you a message.

38:54.606 --> 38:56.140
He said that you and he
need to have a talk.

38:56.142 --> 38:58.042
He's coming after you.
Then let him.

38:59.078 --> 39:00.811
This is Grover.

39:01.680 --> 39:04.849
Yes, sir, Governor. Right away.

39:06.585 --> 39:08.953
I'm, uh, being called
to the principal's office.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.856
All right. I'm going with you.
I can't let you do that.

39:11.858 --> 39:13.891
This is on me.

39:15.627 --> 39:17.962
Well, listen,
whatever happens in there,

39:17.964 --> 39:21.499
listen, man,
I just want to say thank you

39:21.501 --> 39:24.035
for having
my back.

39:24.037 --> 39:26.103
All of you.

39:31.810 --> 39:35.579
All right, little mama,
let's go.

40:32.804 --> 40:34.038
Hey. Way to rock

40:34.040 --> 40:36.307
those lime
green shorts.

40:36.309 --> 40:38.142
You guys playing through

40:38.144 --> 40:40.044
or you just, uh,
fashion patrolling?

40:40.046 --> 40:41.312
Oh, that's crazy, man.

40:41.314 --> 40:42.847
You really look like you should
be on a can of corn.

40:42.849 --> 40:44.315
Ho ho ho.

40:45.218 --> 40:46.517
Hey,

40:46.519 --> 40:48.119
you got a sec?

40:48.121 --> 40:50.421
Man, I ain't got nothing
but time.

40:51.890 --> 40:53.057
Hey, how's
Samantha doing?

40:53.059 --> 40:55.960
Well, she's up and down,
you know.

40:55.962 --> 40:57.628
She took

40:57.630 --> 40:59.396
some time off from school.
We're keeping her close.

40:59.398 --> 41:01.866
She needs... she needs to be
with her family right now.

41:03.902 --> 41:06.604
How's forced retirement?
Well, the governor said

41:06.606 --> 41:08.606
that my actions
were a gross abuse

41:08.608 --> 41:11.509
of power by a sworn
officer of the law

41:11.511 --> 41:15.646
and my misuse of HPD
resources was unprecedented.

41:15.648 --> 41:17.381
So basically nothing
I wouldn't have done

41:17.383 --> 41:18.849
under the same circumstances.

41:20.385 --> 41:22.319
You did what you had to do
to get your daughter back

41:22.321 --> 41:23.521
and that's that.

41:23.523 --> 41:24.722
Damn right.
That's what I told the governor.

41:24.724 --> 41:25.656
All right,

41:25.658 --> 41:26.991
so what's next?
Well,

41:26.993 --> 41:30.327
I'm gonna smoke this cigar
and, um...

41:30.329 --> 41:34.031
I don't know.
Maybe I'll play another 18.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.367
Another 18.

41:36.369 --> 41:40.371
Look, man, I love golf,
but every day?

41:40.373 --> 41:41.972
I'm a cop.

41:41.974 --> 41:43.707
I've been a cop for
the last 30 years.

41:43.709 --> 41:45.109
I don't know
how to do nothing else.

41:45.111 --> 41:47.144
Well, that's good
'cause you don't need to.

41:47.146 --> 41:48.479
What are you talking about?

41:48.481 --> 41:50.247
Oh, come on.

41:51.383 --> 41:53.951
We want you to join Five-O.

41:53.953 --> 41:56.153
Wow, man, I really
appreciate that.

41:56.155 --> 41:58.856
I mean it from the bottom of
my heart, but let's be real.

41:58.858 --> 42:00.357
I'm a disgraced cop.

42:00.359 --> 42:04.662
I've been fired. Nobody's gonna
let me wear a badge again.

42:04.664 --> 42:06.797
That won't be an obstacle.
Trust me.

42:06.799 --> 42:08.199
Just say yes.

42:08.201 --> 42:10.034
He's not gonna take no
for an answer.

42:12.504 --> 42:14.205
It's not
a handout, Lou.

42:16.208 --> 42:18.275
We need you.

42:20.045 --> 42:22.179
Well, I suppose if you insist.

42:27.519 --> 42:28.819
How's that look? Good?

42:28.821 --> 42:30.588
- Like it was meant to be.
- Looks like it found

42:30.590 --> 42:32.756
a good home.

42:33.792 --> 42:36.427
Welcome to the family.
Aw, thank you.

42:36.429 --> 42:37.962
Thank you very much.

42:37.964 --> 42:39.663
Good to have you,
bruddah.

42:39.665 --> 42:40.931
I don't know what to say, man.

42:40.933 --> 42:43.534
Hope you like getting shot at.
