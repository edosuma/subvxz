00:23.565 --> 00:28.654
We can expect mild weather along the
Atlantic seaboard. Here's Matt with his report.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.990
Stock prices fell for
the third consecutive session today...

00:32.073 --> 00:35.285
...amid worries about
the prospect of higher interest rates.

00:35.369 --> 00:40.082
The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell almost 14Â½ points to 3837...

00:40.165 --> 00:45.003
...bringing the blue chip index's losses over
the last three days to just under 100 points.

01:08.694 --> 01:11.071
- 911 operator.
- This is Dr Saul Grissom.

01:11.154 --> 01:15.117
- There's a fire outside my apartment.
- Are you at 700 East 56th Street?

01:15.200 --> 01:19.955
- Yes, apartment 606. For God's sakes, hurry!
- Fire units are being dispatched.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.676
Somebody help! Help!

01:54.990 --> 01:58.535
Keep right. Please keep moving, sir.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.255
I don't see any smoke anywhere.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.300
Get a crew up to the roof!

02:13.383 --> 02:17.930
This is Lieutenant Regan. We have
a possible 2-3 false alarm in apartment 606.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.849
Let's confirm that location. 606.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.894
Yes, that's affirmative. 606.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.523
It's cold. Let's do it!

02:38.408 --> 02:40.494
I'll take the bedroom.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.831
He looks dead.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.200
Nothing here.

02:52.387 --> 02:55.050
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 04 - Sleepless

04:22.387 --> 04:26.350
- 911 operator. Police emergency.
- This is Dr Saul Grissom.

04:26.433 --> 04:30.145
- There's a fire outside my apartment.
- Are you at 700 East 56th Street?

04:30.229 --> 04:34.441
- Yes, apartment 606. For God's sakes, hurry!
- Fire units are being dispatched.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.026
Please stay on the line.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.571
The article makes no mention of a fire.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.950
Yes, Agent Mulder, I can read.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.536
Grissom's company
had government contracts,

04:45.619 --> 04:49.414
so this investigation
would be within the Bureau's jurisdiction.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.960
But that's not why
you want the assignment.

04:54.962 --> 05:00.050
I think that the circumstances surrounding
Grissom's death warrant a closer look.

05:00.133 --> 05:05.806
NYPD won't even talk to me unless you
get the Attorney General to sign off on it.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.350
Where did you get the tape?

05:08.767 --> 05:13.605
Presumably someone has led you to believe
there's more here than is being reported.

05:14.147 --> 05:19.111
My source, the only one
I've ever trusted, is dead.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.413
I'll look into this further
and, uh... let you know.

05:31.165 --> 05:36.420
In the meantime, you have 24 hours
of wiretap tape to transcribe.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.882
You comin' over or what?

05:39.965 --> 05:42.301
You said you was comin'
over two hours ago.

05:42.384 --> 05:46.305
I'm waitin'here like some bimbo
who ain't got nothin'better to do...

05:51.935 --> 05:55.647
...waitin' here like some bimbo
who ain't got nothin'better to do...

05:55.731 --> 05:57.816
...than just sit around and wait for you.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.985
Agent Mulder?

06:01.028 --> 06:04.364
- Yeah?
- It's your 302.

06:04.448 --> 06:07.492
Assistant Director Skinner
just approved it.

06:09.828 --> 06:13.290
There's a mistake.
Another agent has been assigned to the case.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.626
That would be me.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.878
Krycek. Alex Krycek.

06:18.670 --> 06:23.300
- Skinner didn't mention taking on a partner.
- It wasn't Skinner.

06:23.383 --> 06:27.596
I opened the file two hours before
your request, so technically it's my case.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.101
- You already talked to the police?
- Yep.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.688
Just hung up on the officer in charge
a few minutes ago.

06:37.189 --> 06:40.692
A detective named... Horton.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.571
- Seems Grissom called 911 to report a fire.
- I heard the tape.

06:46.031 --> 06:50.035
Did you hear that Forensics found
a spent fire-extinguisher on the floor?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.371
Grissom's prints were all over it.

06:53.413 --> 06:58.210
The walls and floor in his living room
were covered with ammonium phosphate.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.213
- But no trace of fire?
- Not even a burnt match.

07:01.547 --> 07:04.299
- Is that all you know?
- Yeah. So far.

07:05.717 --> 07:09.054
- What do you think it means?
- I appreciate the show and tell...

07:09.137 --> 07:12.724
...and I don't want you to take this
personally, but I work alone.

07:12.808 --> 07:17.813
- I'll straighten things out with Skinner.
- It's my case, Agent Mulder.

07:18.355 --> 07:22.317
Look, I may be... green...

07:22.901 --> 07:26.613
...but I had the case first
and I'm not gonna give it away so quickly.

07:27.906 --> 07:31.410
I'll tell you what.
I got some work to finish up around here.

07:31.493 --> 07:36.623
Why don't you go to the motor pool and
requisition us a car? I'll meet you there.

07:36.707 --> 07:40.043
That's all? You don't have a problem
with us working together?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.462
Hey, it's your party.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.676
I'll, um... I'll get the car.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.400
Electrocution affects
electrolytic conduction...

08:03.483 --> 08:07.154
...disrupting the heartbeat
and most of the autonomic systems.

08:07.237 --> 08:11.825
Death actually occurs from tissue damage,
necrosis in the heart itself...

08:11.909 --> 08:15.746
...particularly in the sinus
and atrioventricular nodes.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.208
Agent Scully. Sorry to interrupt.
You have a call from a George Hale.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.628
- Says it's urgent.
- Excuse me.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.549
- Where are you?
- National Airport.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.718
Catching the shuttle to LaGuardia.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.513
Wanna join me in the Big Apple
for an autopsy?

08:32.763 --> 08:35.474
- What's going on?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.352
I can't today.
My last class isn't over until 4.30.

08:38.644 --> 08:41.480
That's fine.
I can have the ME wrap the body to go.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.232
- Mulder...
- You'll get it by five.

08:46.485 --> 08:47.945
What's the name?

08:58.831 --> 09:02.042
Doctor Grissom's alpha wave analysis
defined the standard.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.670
He revolutionised the way
we think about sleep.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.381
His death is a tremendous loss to science.

09:07.673 --> 09:10.384
How many other kinds
of sleep disorder did he treat?

09:10.467 --> 09:13.720
There are 38 different
dyssomnias and parasomnias.

09:13.804 --> 09:17.516
Doctor Grissom treated them all
with an unprecedented success ratio.

09:17.599 --> 09:21.228
Maintaining that kind of batting average
must have taken its toll.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.689
Excellence demands certain sacrifices.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.942
- Did he show signs of psychological stress?
- Not really.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.903
Except for his own occasional
bout of insomnia.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.698
- But he was never delusional?
- Of course not.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.869
- What's his story?
- This patient's night terrors...

09:36.952 --> 09:41.248
...prevent him from cycling out of REM sleep
into the more restful slow-wave sleep.

09:41.331 --> 09:46.461
It's still experimental, but we're trying
to modify his brain wave patterns externally.

09:46.628 --> 09:50.382
- How do you do that?
- Electrical stimulation of the occipital lobe...

09:50.465 --> 09:53.260
...creates visual and auditory hallucinations.

09:53.594 --> 09:57.931
- It's possible to alter somebody's dreams?
- In theory, yes.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.826
I paid off your cab.

10:17.910 --> 10:22.623
- I don't like being ditched like a bad date.
- Sorry if I hurt your feelings.

10:22.706 --> 10:26.293
What's with this attitude?
You don't know the first thing about me.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.920
Exactly.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.965
You know, back at the academy...
some of the guys used to make fun of you.

10:32.049 --> 10:36.678
- Stop it or you're gonna hurt my feelings.
- But some of us followed your work.

10:36.762 --> 10:40.724
Because we knew there was more
out there than they were telling us.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.564
- Yeah.
- Dr Grissom didn't die from cardiac arrest.

10:48.148 --> 10:52.194
- What is it?
- I think you should take a look for yourself.

10:52.277 --> 10:57.783
I haven't even started on the chest and the
abdomen and I'll have more to tell you then.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.952
I can make it in two hours.

11:03.539 --> 11:05.624
Where are we going?

11:14.550 --> 11:17.177
- Spleen or pancreas?
- Stomach.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.346
I was just about to start on it.

11:20.347 --> 11:25.310
Oh, uh... this is Alex Krycek.
We're working the case together.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.646
- Good to meet you.
- You too.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.150
Notice the pugilistic attitude of the corpse.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.492
This condition generally occurs
several hours after death.

11:40.576 --> 11:43.328
It's caused by
a coagulation of muscle proteins...

11:43.412 --> 11:46.707
...when the body is exposed
to extremely high temperatures.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.918
- Like fire?
- This degree of limb flexion...

11:50.002 --> 11:53.589
...is observed exclusively
in burn-related victims.

11:53.672 --> 11:58.510
- There was no fire.
- And no epidermal burns to indicate that.

11:58.594 --> 12:02.514
But when I opened up the skull,
I found extradural haemorrhages...

12:02.598 --> 12:05.350
...which can only be caused by intense heat.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.270
Somehow this man suffered
all of the secondary...

12:08.353 --> 12:13.025
...but none of the primary physiological
responses to having been in a fire.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.235
Any theories?

12:15.319 --> 12:20.449
I can't even begin to explain what could
have caused it. I mean, it's almost as if...

12:20.532 --> 12:22.618
What?

12:23.452 --> 12:27.748
As if his body believed
that it was burning.

12:43.013 --> 12:48.560
... with sapphire and cubic zirconium
baguettes, all in a 14-carat gold band.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.980
Now, normally this ring retails for 1350.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.316
Well, I think it'd be a value at 900.

12:54.399 --> 12:58.070
I saw it in a big department store
last week for $1,000...

12:58.153 --> 13:01.406
...but you will not believe
what we are offering it to you for.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.659
677!

13:03.742 --> 13:05.827
I mean, isn't that wonderful...

13:09.039 --> 13:12.292
You left the door open, Willig.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.128
Preacher?

13:15.212 --> 13:18.423
Not a good idea leaving your door open
in this neighbourhood.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.551
You never know who's gonna drop by.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.554
Damn! What are you doing here?

13:26.181 --> 13:30.143
- How long you been in town?
- Not long.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.856
You want a beer?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.652
How you doing, Henry? Huh?

13:39.278 --> 13:42.531
Huh? How you been?

13:44.449 --> 13:48.245
How am I doing? I'm, uh...

13:50.080 --> 13:54.501
...trying to forget. You know?
I'm trying to get it out of my head.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.462
No luck, huh?

13:58.255 --> 14:00.924
No. I'm, uh...

14:03.093 --> 14:05.179
...still fighting it, you know.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.682
I keep seeing the faces.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.394
Every day I see...

14:13.395 --> 14:15.731
Ah, what's the difference?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.859
We're all going to hell, right?

14:18.942 --> 14:22.362
Where you think we've been
the last 24 years?

14:22.446 --> 14:26.491
But after this,
wherever he sends us is gonna seem like...

14:26.575 --> 14:28.660
Like a Hawaiian vacation.

14:33.499 --> 14:35.584
What do you want here, Preacher?

14:39.505 --> 14:41.715
You killed him, didn't you?

14:44.051 --> 14:46.512
You killed Grissom. I saw it on TV.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.682
He had to pay, Henry.

14:50.766 --> 14:54.353
All of us have to answer
for what we did over there.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.315
We can't get away from it.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.078
No.

15:11.912 --> 15:17.084
"He retains not his anger for ever,
because he delights in mercy."

15:17.167 --> 15:21.338
"He will turn again;
he will have compassion on us."

15:21.964 --> 15:24.299
"He will subdue our iniquities," Henry...

15:24.383 --> 15:28.262
..."and he will cast all our sins
into the depths of the sea."

15:31.056 --> 15:33.725
It's all right, Henry.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.061
It's all over now.

15:59.835 --> 16:03.297
The victim was Henry Willig.
Unemployed, lived on disability.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.008
No indication of forced entry or struggle.

16:06.091 --> 16:09.511
No abrasions or contusions
or trace evidence in the body.

16:09.595 --> 16:13.390
Cause of death is being listed as...
burst aneurysm.

16:13.473 --> 16:18.061
- Why did your friend from Homicide call us?
- Because a medical examiner called him.

16:18.145 --> 16:22.065
The autopsy revealed 43 internal
haemorrhages and skeletal fragments...

16:22.149 --> 16:24.318
...which doesn't happen spontaneously.

16:24.526 --> 16:28.989
- Not without corresponding external trauma.
- What does the ME have to say about it?

16:29.072 --> 16:34.411
He said if he didn't know otherwise,
he'd swear they were gunshot wounds.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.414
What's this scar right here?

16:37.498 --> 16:41.001
His records say the only surgery
he had was an appendectomy.

16:41.084 --> 16:44.046
Unless they got to his appendix
through his neck.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.966
Maybe it happened in Vietnam.
Willig did a tour with the marines in 1970.

16:48.050 --> 16:52.054
- I'm sure they didn't keep the best of records.
- Willig was a marine?

16:52.137 --> 16:55.891
So where do marines receive
basic training on the East Coast?

16:55.974 --> 16:57.893
Parris Island?

16:59.353 --> 17:02.481
Where Grissom was stationed
from 1968 to 1971.

17:03.273 --> 17:08.069
Which means that he and Willig
were there at the same time. 24 years ago.

17:13.367 --> 17:18.288
There we go. Willig was assigned
to Special Force and Recon Squad J-7.

17:18.372 --> 17:21.415
Of 13 original members,
he's one of two survivors.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.752
Till yesterday.

17:23.836 --> 17:28.882
Which leaves us with one person who can
tell us what happened at Parris Island.

17:31.885 --> 17:36.265
I've been supervising Mr Cole's treatment
since I admitted him 12 years ago.

17:37.307 --> 17:40.561
I'm afraid you won't find him
very cooperative, though.

17:40.644 --> 17:44.273
We just want to ask him
a few questions about his military service.

17:44.356 --> 17:47.860
He doesn't respond very well to...
authority figures.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.529
Is that why you put him in isolation?

17:50.612 --> 17:53.115
We've had to house Mr Cole in this section...

17:53.198 --> 17:56.785
...because he was interfering with
our treatment of other patients.

17:56.869 --> 18:01.248
- How was he interfering?
- He was disrupting their sleep patterns.

18:01.331 --> 18:05.419
With psychiatric patients,
the circadian cycles must be maintained.

18:05.502 --> 18:09.631
Excuse me, but exactly how
would Cole disrupt their sleep?

18:10.591 --> 18:12.259
Here we are.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.554
Mr Cole!
There are some gentlemen here who...

18:21.727 --> 18:24.688
- You discharged him two days ago.
- I certainly did not.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.773
Don't you think I'd remember if I did?

18:26.857 --> 18:31.612
I was on shift, and you signed the order
yourself. That is your signature, isn't it?

18:38.285 --> 18:41.872
Let's get Cole's face out on the wire.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.833
- Mulder.
- Mr Mulder.

18:44.917 --> 18:48.170
I've obtained information
that might assist your work.

18:48.253 --> 18:51.173
But you must exercise discretion
when we meet.

18:51.256 --> 18:54.134
If anyone follows you, I won't be there.

19:32.047 --> 19:35.509
- Who are you?
- Who I am is irrelevant.

19:40.681 --> 19:42.683
- Why are you trying to help me?
- You think I want to be here, Agent Mulder?

19:42.683 --> 19:45.352
- Why are you trying to help me?
- You think I want to be here, Agent Mulder?

19:45.435 --> 19:47.104
I don't want to be here.

19:49.982 --> 19:53.652
- What is this?
- Data from a top-secret military project...

19:53.735 --> 19:57.781
...born of the idea that sleep
is the soldier's greatest enemy.

20:00.742 --> 20:04.830
Grissom was conducting sleep-deprivation
experiments on Parris Island.

20:04.913 --> 20:08.125
Not deprivation. Eradication.

20:08.667 --> 20:12.087
- Why?
- Why else? To build a better soldier.

20:13.130 --> 20:17.009
Sustained wakefulness dulls fear,
heightens aggression.

20:18.302 --> 20:21.305
Science had just put a man on the moon...

20:21.388 --> 20:24.850
...so they looked to science
to win a losing war.

20:25.726 --> 20:27.728
And Willig and Cole were the lab rats?

20:27.895 --> 20:31.565
Lab rats with the highest
kill-ratio in the Marine Corps.

20:31.648 --> 20:36.236
4,000-plus confirmed kills
for a 13-man squad.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.572
Is Cole behind what's happening now?

20:38.655 --> 20:41.950
I'm not here to do your thinking,
Agent Mulder.

20:42.034 --> 20:46.622
All I know is Augustus Cole
hasn't slept in 24 years.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.918
There's someone else you should see.

20:51.001 --> 20:54.004
Another squad member
reportedly killed in action.

20:54.379 --> 20:58.217
- I thought Cole was the last.
- His name is on the envelope.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.849
- How do I contact you?
- You can't.

21:05.933 --> 21:09.436
- I may need more.
- You still don't get it, do you?

21:09.520 --> 21:14.274
Closing the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>, separating
you and Scully, was only the beginning.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.570
The truth is still out there...

21:20.113 --> 21:22.407
...but it's never been more dangerous.

21:24.701 --> 21:29.206
The man we both knew...
paid for that information with his life.

21:30.541 --> 21:33.293
A sacrifice I'm not willing to make.

22:07.661 --> 22:10.122
Where were you?

22:10.205 --> 22:15.169
Someone matching Cole's description just
robbed a drugstore. He's in a nearby motel.

22:15.252 --> 22:18.005
- Is he alive?
- He was when the night manager saw him.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.550
So where were you?

22:23.552 --> 22:25.929
Detective Horton?

22:26.013 --> 22:28.307
I'm Agent Krycek. This is Agent Mulder.

22:28.390 --> 22:33.228
I've been waiting for you. I tried holding the
SWAT guys back, but they're getting antsy.

22:33.312 --> 22:36.773
Cole didn't steal dime one
from that drugstore. Just some pills.

22:36.857 --> 22:38.775
Freeze!

22:46.283 --> 22:48.368
Inside! Now!

22:49.661 --> 22:51.747
Officer down!

22:53.373 --> 22:57.920
We got two officers down. Both critical.
Request emergency vehicles immediately.

22:58.003 --> 23:01.298
Roger, I copy
on your officers being down...

23:12.559 --> 23:14.645
What's going on here, Mulder?

23:16.021 --> 23:19.066
These two officers. They shot each other.

23:27.950 --> 23:32.788
Also described in the report is
an experimental neurosurgical procedure...

23:32.871 --> 23:36.250
...designed to induce
a permanent waking state.

23:36.333 --> 23:40.712
The procedure involved cutting part of
the brain stem in the midpontile region...

23:40.796 --> 23:43.507
...which would explain Henry Willig's scar.

23:44.174 --> 23:47.886
A similar scar should also
be evident on Augustus Cole.

23:47.970 --> 23:51.390
Postop treatment included
a regimen of synthetic supplements...

23:51.473 --> 23:55.561
...to replenish the organic deficits
caused by prolonged lack of sleep.

23:55.644 --> 24:00.357
This is consistent with the antidepressants
Cole robbed from the pharmacy.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.652
These drugs maintain
serotonin levels in the blood...

24:03.735 --> 24:08.574
...serotonin being the primary substance
produced during sleep.

24:08.657 --> 24:14.246
It is theoretically possible that this procedure
diminished the subjects'need for sleep...

24:14.329 --> 24:18.834
...but I can neither quantify nor substantiate
its success without further evidence.

24:20.586 --> 24:23.422
- Scully.
- The second officer is still in a coma...

24:23.505 --> 24:26.508
...so I don't think we can count on him
to tell us what happened.

24:28.051 --> 24:31.889
I'm going over these reports you faxed me.
They're incredible.

24:31.972 --> 24:37.644
The military already sent troops through
radioactive clouds. They had to top that.

24:37.728 --> 24:41.398
Sleep eradication doesn't explain
the shooting of those officers.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.818
Or the anomalous autopsy results
on Willig and Dr Grissom.

24:44.902 --> 24:48.488
I learnt at Grissom's clinic
what happens to a person's cortex...

24:48.572 --> 24:50.908
...when you stimulate it with electricity.

24:50.991 --> 24:55.787
They have visual and auditory hallucinations.
Any med student can tell you that.

24:56.079 --> 24:59.541
What if that stimulus
were to come from a remote source?

24:59.625 --> 25:03.629
What if Cole has developed the ability
to project his unconscious?

25:05.088 --> 25:08.926
Are you suggesting Cole killed
those people with telepathic images?

25:09.009 --> 25:12.930
Think about it, Scully.
In all those years without REM sleep...

25:13.013 --> 25:18.227
...maybe Cole bridged the waking world and
the dream world-the collective unconscious.

25:18.477 --> 25:21.980
And what if, by existing consciously
in the unconscious world...

25:22.064 --> 25:26.902
...he's developed the ability to externalise
his dreams and effectively alter reality?

25:28.904 --> 25:32.783
Even if you're right, you'll have
a better chance of finding Cole...

25:32.866 --> 25:36.537
...if you work up a profile
and try and surmise his next move.

25:37.871 --> 25:41.542
All right. I'll sharpen my pencils
and I'll see you later.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.796
I'll be right there, Krycek.

25:46.338 --> 25:49.633
- Where are you going?
- To check on another member of the squad.

25:49.716 --> 25:53.929
- See if he can tell us something.
- Sounds like your new partner's working out.

25:54.429 --> 25:58.016
He's all right. He could use
a little seasoning and wardrobe advice.

25:58.100 --> 26:01.353
- He's more open to extreme possibilities...
- Than I was?

26:02.271 --> 26:04.857
Than I assumed he would be.

26:05.649 --> 26:09.194
Must be nice not having someone
questioning your every move...

26:09.278 --> 26:11.488
...poking holes in all your theories.

26:11.572 --> 26:13.657
Oh... Oh yeah. It... It's great.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.410
I'm surprised I put up with you for so long.

26:22.166 --> 26:24.334
You'd better go.

26:24.418 --> 26:28.755
I'll read over this report again
and see what else I can come up with.

26:28.839 --> 26:29.882
OK.

26:54.865 --> 26:56.950
Clear this up.

27:15.052 --> 27:17.387
Salvatore Matola?

27:19.306 --> 27:21.934
Are you here to shoot me?
You gonna kill me?

27:22.017 --> 27:24.895
No. We're with the FBI.

27:24.978 --> 27:27.564
We just wanted to ask you some questions.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.567
Why did you think we were here to kill you?

27:31.944 --> 27:34.738
- I dunno.
- You know about Willig and Grissom, huh?

27:36.782 --> 27:41.620
I read about it in the paper.
Figured they were finally killing us all off.

27:42.079 --> 27:44.164
Who?

27:47.459 --> 27:49.878
Hey, Sal, can you spare a few minutes?

27:50.838 --> 27:54.842
Yeah, I guess so. I got a break coming up.

28:02.057 --> 28:04.852
Spare a few minutes. I guess.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.902
They said it'd be like living two lifetimes.

28:13.986 --> 28:17.698
And that... At first, that's what it was like.

28:19.199 --> 28:21.285
Not having to sleep an' all...

28:22.077 --> 28:25.539
...made us feel like
nothing could touch us, you know?

28:25.622 --> 28:27.082
Uh...

28:27.166 --> 28:29.793
We'd do 24-hour patrols...

28:29.877 --> 28:33.672
...night ambushes, you know?
That type of thing.

28:33.755 --> 28:38.260
- And you never got tired?
- No. Not so that we had to sleep.

28:39.595 --> 28:42.431
And then, nothing that the pills couldn't fix.

28:42.598 --> 28:45.642
- Serotonin?
- Yeah.

28:48.604 --> 28:50.898
How long did this go on?

28:52.399 --> 28:54.276
Quite a while, I'd say.

28:55.319 --> 29:01.283
Quite a while. Until we stopped taking orders
from Company Commander in Saigon.

29:01.617 --> 29:04.119
The entire squadron went AWOL?

29:06.872 --> 29:09.291
Yeah. Something like that.

29:11.710 --> 29:15.255
- Well, then who did you take orders from?
- We didn't.

29:15.339 --> 29:18.342
We just made up missions as we went along.

29:19.218 --> 29:22.429
Till it didn't matter any more
who we were killing.

29:23.764 --> 29:25.891
Farmers... women.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.020
Outside of Phu Bai there was this...

29:31.605 --> 29:33.690
...school, and, uh...

29:39.530 --> 29:41.615
They were just kids.

29:43.367 --> 29:45.911
No one ever tried to stop you?

29:47.496 --> 29:49.748
No, sir.

29:54.753 --> 29:59.258
Police suspect Augustus Cole may be
behind the murders of Willig and Grissom.

29:59.341 --> 30:01.468
You mean Preacher?

30:02.511 --> 30:06.640
That's what we used to call him -
he was always reading from his Bible.

30:06.723 --> 30:10.310
You know, saying this and that
about Judgment Day.

30:10.394 --> 30:14.523
Saying that one day we were gonna
have to pay for what we were doing.

30:15.357 --> 30:20.195
That's... that's what he said back then.
That's what he'd say.

30:20.279 --> 30:25.075
But why Grissom? He was never in-country.
He wasn't even part of the squadron.

30:25.784 --> 30:27.870
Sure he was.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.831
He made us what we are.

30:34.501 --> 30:37.504
- Him and Dr Girardi.
- Who's Dr Girardi?

30:37.796 --> 30:42.009
The other doc on the project.
The one who did the surgeries on us.

30:44.094 --> 30:46.513
It's because of him that...

30:48.056 --> 30:50.475
...I haven't slept a night in 24 years.

30:59.193 --> 31:02.946
I'm still not clear why
you think Cole will go after Girardi.

31:03.030 --> 31:05.324
Cole sees himself as an avenging angel.

31:05.407 --> 31:08.660
He thinks everyone
responsible for the atrocities...

31:08.744 --> 31:11.413
...directly or indirectly, must be punished.

31:11.497 --> 31:14.791
Yeah, but why now?
Why after all these years?

31:15.709 --> 31:20.672
Phu Bai was one of the bloodiest massacres
of the war. Over 300 children slaughtered.

31:20.756 --> 31:24.218
And unlike My Lai,
no US troops were ever charged.

31:24.301 --> 31:27.513
The 24th anniversary of the massacre
was two days ago.

31:31.266 --> 31:34.478
- Mulder.
- I think I've found Francis Girardi.

31:34.561 --> 31:37.022
He's a professor of neurosurgery at Harvard.

31:37.105 --> 31:41.527
- Do you have his number in Boston?
- Yes. But he's coming to Grissom's funeral.

31:41.610 --> 31:45.823
- When?
- Tonight. He arrives at Bronx station at 7.30.

31:46.198 --> 31:50.160
Get a photograph to the security desk
so we know who we're looking for.

31:50.244 --> 31:51.787
Got it.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.796
- Mulder, FBI. You got a photo for me?
- Right here.

32:12.099 --> 32:14.518
Stay here. I'll cover the other side.

33:03.775 --> 33:05.861
Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

33:06.111 --> 33:08.363
Drop it!

33:25.339 --> 33:27.466
Mulder.

33:28.884 --> 33:30.677
You all right?

33:30.761 --> 33:33.347
Girardi! Where is he?

33:33.430 --> 33:35.432
Girardi's not here.

33:35.516 --> 33:37.601
I saw him. He was...

33:39.520 --> 33:40.979
Mulder!

33:41.063 --> 33:45.817
You were shouting and waving your gun
around, but Girardi never showed.

33:46.777 --> 33:50.364
No, Girardi was here. So was Cole.
We just missed them.

33:53.408 --> 33:56.411
Mulder, if they'd been here,
I would have seen them.

33:56.495 --> 33:59.373
I'm telling you, Mulder. They weren't here.

34:02.835 --> 34:05.838
OK, there's nothing here
so let's rewind the tape.

34:05.921 --> 34:10.132
Start with a small window of time -
say, 1935 to 1945.

34:10.217 --> 34:14.471
If you don't find anything within that
time frame, open it up one minute at a time.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.724
With all these cameras,
we should be able to see something.

34:17.808 --> 34:19.893
Can we talk for a second?

34:23.188 --> 34:25.107
What's the problem?

34:25.190 --> 34:28.610
You still haven't answered
my question about what happened.

34:28.694 --> 34:33.699
- I told you, I thought I saw Girardi.
- Come on. You just about killed someone!

34:34.533 --> 34:38.579
And we both know I'm covering for you
by keeping it between us.

34:38.661 --> 34:42.081
- All right, what do you want to know?
- Just the truth.

34:43.083 --> 34:47.713
- There's things that I need to know.
- My ideas are usually not very popular.

34:47.795 --> 34:51.300
I told you, I wanna believe.
But I need a place to start.

34:56.013 --> 35:00.100
I think Cole possesses the psychic ability
to manipulate sounds and images...

35:00.184 --> 35:03.937
...to generate illusions that
are so convincing they can kill.

35:04.021 --> 35:06.356
How's that for a theory?

35:07.149 --> 35:12.905
Puts a whole new spin on virtual reality,
but at least it begins to explain some things.

35:13.238 --> 35:15.324
Agent Mulder?

35:18.744 --> 35:21.997
- See this car in the upper-right corner?
- Yeah.

35:22.664 --> 35:25.584
It wasn't there five minutes ago.

35:27.252 --> 35:29.671
- Where is this?
- That's track 17.

35:29.755 --> 35:31.840
It's a restricted part of the yard.

35:37.679 --> 35:40.015
What are you doing?

35:40.098 --> 35:42.184
This is insane!

35:42.851 --> 35:44.937
You can't do this to me.

35:47.064 --> 35:49.733
You can't hold me responsible.

35:49.816 --> 35:53.070
I was following orders. Just like you.

35:53.487 --> 35:55.489
The Lord hates the lying tongue.

35:55.572 --> 35:57.658
It's the truth.

35:59.117 --> 36:02.246
The truth is what you did to us.
What you made us do.

36:02.371 --> 36:05.958
No one made you do anything.
You volunteered.

36:06.959 --> 36:10.254
"The righteous shall rejoice
when he sees the vengeance."

36:13.298 --> 36:15.509
Who is it?

36:18.679 --> 36:20.138
Who's there?

36:20.222 --> 36:23.183
"He shall wash his feet
in the blood of the wicked."

36:23.308 --> 36:26.436
Who is it? I can't see without my glasses.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.857
You don't need to see to know who it is.
You know who it is!

36:42.703 --> 36:45.247
"He shall pay as the judges determine."

36:46.039 --> 36:48.041
"He shall give life for life...

36:48.625 --> 36:50.419
...eye for eye...

36:50.502 --> 36:52.838
...tooth for tooth, hand for hand...

36:52.921 --> 36:55.215
...foot for foot, burn for burn...

36:55.299 --> 36:58.135
...wound for wound, strike for strike."

36:58.552 --> 37:02.222
"As he has disfigured a man,
so shall he be disfigured."

37:03.265 --> 37:06.185
"And he who kills a man...

37:06.268 --> 37:08.854
...shall be put to death."

38:34.815 --> 38:39.987
He's still alive. Put pressure on the wound
on the back of his neck and radio for help.

38:40.070 --> 38:42.156
Now!

38:45.159 --> 38:48.120
This is Agent Krycek
requesting emergency assistance.

38:48.203 --> 38:51.081
My location's track 17
in the freight warehouse.

39:11.226 --> 39:14.229
Step away from the edge.

39:14.897 --> 39:17.900
Corporal Cole, I'm a federal agent.
Please step back.

39:26.450 --> 39:28.535
Go ahead.

39:29.328 --> 39:32.331
- Shoot me.
- That's not why I came up here.

39:35.042 --> 39:37.127
I'm putting down my gun.

39:38.253 --> 39:42.883
I just wanna talk for a few minutes.
Then you can do whatever you want.

39:44.092 --> 39:46.929
- I'm tired.
- I know.

39:47.012 --> 39:49.097
No, man, you don't know.

39:49.181 --> 39:51.850
- You have no idea.
- One minute is all I'm asking.

39:54.102 --> 39:56.688
One minute's more than I care to give.

39:57.439 --> 39:59.525
The blood's boiling in my veins.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.653
I can feel the air stinging on my skin.

40:02.986 --> 40:07.241
What the military did to you was wrong.
But maybe your testimony can help.

40:07.324 --> 40:09.409
They cut out a piece of my brain.

40:10.202 --> 40:12.287
They made me into somebody else.

40:14.957 --> 40:18.168
And I can never get back
what they took away from me.

40:18.252 --> 40:21.922
But I can stop them
from taking anything more.

40:28.595 --> 40:31.348
Krycek, put down the gun
and get outta here.

40:37.396 --> 40:40.983
Krycek, I said put down the gun
and get outta here!

40:44.611 --> 40:45.946
No!

41:03.964 --> 41:06.049
Good... night.

41:12.848 --> 41:16.560
He had a gun. He was gonna shoot you.

41:24.359 --> 41:26.445
You did the right thing.

42:03.190 --> 42:07.694
They broke into my office.
Went through my files, my computer.

42:07.778 --> 42:11.532
I came down as soon as Security called,
but the report was already gone.

42:11.615 --> 42:15.619
Someone went to a lot of trouble
stealing our copies to keep this a secret.

42:15.702 --> 42:20.916
Without that report as evidence, Skinner's
not gonna authorise an investigation.

42:22.167 --> 42:24.878
He said it's never been more dangerous.

42:24.962 --> 42:26.088
Skinner?

42:26.171 --> 42:29.967
That man who leaked us the report.
The one who's been helping us.

42:30.050 --> 42:31.927
You actually met with him?

42:32.010 --> 42:35.097
He said closing down the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>
is just the beginning.

42:35.180 --> 42:37.808
That we've never been in greater danger.

42:39.726 --> 42:41.812
Do you trust him?

43:01.582 --> 43:04.126
- Do you know where he got this?
- Not yet.

43:05.460 --> 43:09.506
But he got it. Which means
he's either found another source...

43:10.591 --> 43:12.843
...or another source has found him.

43:16.597 --> 43:18.849
Sir, if I can recommend something?

43:20.642 --> 43:24.354
You'll see that I've outlined
several countermeasures.

43:27.065 --> 43:30.360
- What about Scully?
- Reassigning them to other sections...

43:30.444 --> 43:33.989
...seems only to have
strengthened their determination.

43:35.199 --> 43:37.284
Scully's a problem.

43:38.118 --> 43:40.704
A much larger problem than you described.

43:44.791 --> 43:46.877
Every problem has a solution.

44:01.048 --> 44:07.383
