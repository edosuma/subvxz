OF THE LEFT FEMUR.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.330

(man speaking indistinctly)

00:33.134 --> 00:34.235
(exhales)

00:34.235 --> 00:35.566
IT'S AS IF THE BODY
CAN'T ACCEPT

00:35.566 --> 00:38.139
THAT A TERRIBLE TRAUMA
HAS OCCURRED.

00:38.139 --> 00:41.772

PATIENTS WHO EXPERIENCE
PHANTOM LIMB...

00:53.784 --> 00:55.426
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

00:55.426 --> 00:58.058
NOTHING.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.530
IS IT HURTING AGAIN?

00:59.530 --> 01:02.093
NO, I'M FINE. I'M FINE.
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

01:02.093 --> 01:03.164
OKAY.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.696
REPORT
MANY DIFFERENT SENSATIONS.

01:07.698 --> 01:11.372
BUT BY FAR, THE MOST COMMON...

01:16.177 --> 01:18.449
IS PAIN.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.153
(sighs)

01:22.153 --> 01:24.255
UH, AN ACOUSTIC NEUROMA?

01:24.255 --> 01:25.416
OH, BOY.

01:25.416 --> 01:27.118
A LONG, DIFFICULT SURGERY

01:27.118 --> 01:29.290
WITH A STUPID-HIGH POST-EXCISION
MORTALITY/MORBIDITY?

01:29.290 --> 01:31.292
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO
START MY HAND WITH?

01:31.292 --> 01:32.623
IT'S MY HAND.
(elevator bell dings)

01:32.623 --> 01:34.125
AND THANKS FOR MAKING IT
SOUND SO FUN.

01:34.125 --> 01:35.296
YOU CAN'T TRY SOMETHING

01:35.296 --> 01:36.497
WITH A LITTLE MARGIN
FOR ERROR?

01:36.497 --> 01:37.828
I WAS SO SUPPOSED TO OPERATE
ON JIMMY MONTHS AGO,

01:37.828 --> 01:40.531
BUT THEN THE PLANE CRASHED.
IT HAS TO BE TODAY.

01:40.531 --> 01:41.702
(sighs) WELL,
IF YOU CAN DO THIS,

01:41.702 --> 01:42.873
I GUESS MY HAND
CAN DO ANYTHING.

01:42.873 --> 01:43.834
STILL MY HAND.

01:43.834 --> 01:45.206
MM-HMM.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.537
UH...

01:46.537 --> 01:48.379
OKAY, FOLKS.
LET'S JUST START.

01:48.379 --> 01:49.840
(indistinct conversations)

01:49.840 --> 01:51.482
(clears throat)
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

01:51.482 --> 01:53.314
SEATTLE GRACE MERCY WEST
HAS SUFFERED

01:53.314 --> 01:55.346
A FINANCIAL SETBACK.

01:55.346 --> 01:57.418
THE ADMINISTRATION
IS WORKING HARD

01:57.418 --> 01:59.520
TO KEEP THE IMPACT OF THAT
SETBACK AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.121
TO THAT END,

02:01.121 --> 02:03.594
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INITIATE
SOME COST-CUTTING MEASURES.

02:03.594 --> 02:07.127
THE BOARD HAS HIRED
A PHYSICIAN ADVISOR TO HELP.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.599
WHAT'S A PHYSICIAN ADVISOR?

02:08.599 --> 02:10.201
WELL, SHE CONSULTS ON
MAXIMIZING EFFICIENCY,

02:10.201 --> 02:11.562
STREAMLINING PROCESSES,

02:11.562 --> 02:14.165
ASSESSING WHERE WE CAN
TRIM OUR BUDGETS.

02:14.165 --> 02:16.667
WHO TO FIRE
AND WHEN TO FIRE THEM?
(elevator bell dings)

02:16.667 --> 02:18.739
(clears throat) SHE'S HERE
TO ADVISE AND TO HELP.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.671
I WAS HOPING TO INTRODUCE HER
IN PERSON,

02:20.671 --> 02:22.173
BUT SHE SEEMS TO BE LATE.

02:22.173 --> 02:23.514
(Cristina)
OH, ON HER FIRST DAY?

02:23.514 --> 02:25.176
NOT VERY EFFICIENT.

02:25.176 --> 02:26.377
(laughter)

02:26.377 --> 02:27.478
(Owen) YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE HER
IN THE HALLS,

02:27.478 --> 02:28.819
IN YOUR LABS, IN THE O.R.

02:28.819 --> 02:30.150
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE
AN ACCOUNTANT

02:30.150 --> 02:31.582
FOLLOWING US AROUND
IN THE O.R.s?

02:31.582 --> 02:33.854
SHE'S NOT AN ACCOUNTANT.
SHE IS A TRAINED SURGEON.

02:33.854 --> 02:37.288
FRANKLY, SHE IS HERE
TO TRY TO HELP US.
(woman) OH, OKAY.
HELP US. RIGHT.

02:37.288 --> 02:38.729
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

02:38.729 --> 02:40.731
(indistinct conversations)

02:40.731 --> 02:42.333
HEY. CAN I GET A MINUTE?

02:42.333 --> 02:43.494
IT'S URGENT.

02:43.494 --> 02:44.935
YEAH.

02:44.935 --> 02:46.197
THIS WAS URGENT?

02:46.197 --> 02:48.569
YES. IT'S THE STUPID
PREGNANCY HORMONES.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.601
IT MAKES ME WANT TO HAVE SEX
ALL THE TIME, URGENTLY.

02:50.601 --> 02:52.443
OH, I LIKE
THE STUPID HORMONES.

02:52.443 --> 02:53.604
MM. MM.
(smartphone chimes)

02:53.604 --> 02:54.945
OH, NO.
WHAT?

02:54.945 --> 02:56.307
(chimes)
(moans)

02:56.307 --> 02:57.808
OH, I HAVE A CONSULT.
WHAT?

02:57.808 --> 02:59.480
I HAVE A CONSULT.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.881
(whimpers)

03:00.881 --> 03:02.383
ARE YOU CRYING?

03:02.383 --> 03:04.184
(sniffles) NO.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.886
YES.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.818
I CRY EVERY TIME
I GET MAD.

03:07.818 --> 03:09.189
YOU'RE NOT--YOU'RE MAD?

03:09.189 --> 03:10.691
YES, I'M MAD,
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE SEX

03:10.691 --> 03:12.393
BECAUSE I HAVE
THIS STUPID CONSULT.
(knock on door)

03:12.393 --> 03:14.465
(Shane) DR. SHEPHERD?
ROSS?

03:14.465 --> 03:15.626
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, SIR,

03:15.626 --> 03:17.398
BUT I WAS HOPING TO SCRUB IN
WITH YOU TODAY,

03:17.398 --> 03:19.400
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
ON DR. GREY'S SERVICE.
(crying)

03:19.400 --> 03:20.931
SO I WAS WONDERING

03:20.931 --> 03:24.204
IF MAYBE YOU COULD TALK
TO YOUR WIFE FOR ME.
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.977
NO, ROSS, HE CANNOT TALK
TO HIS WIFE FOR YOU,

03:26.977 --> 03:29.510
BECAUSE YOU ARE WITH ME,
AND WE HAVE A CONSULT

03:29.510 --> 03:31.482
WITH A PREGNANT LADY
WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN.

03:31.482 --> 03:32.883
SO GO DO THE WORKUP,

03:32.883 --> 03:34.815
AND I WILL SEE YOU THERE.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.847
(telephone ringing in distance)

03:38.849 --> 03:40.851
AHH.
(door opens)

03:40.851 --> 03:44.224
I AM LIKING
THE STUPID HORMONES.
(door slams)

03:44.224 --> 03:45.326
(indistinct conversations,
siren wailing in distance)

03:45.326 --> 03:46.827
HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.958
(telephone ringing)

03:47.958 --> 03:50.431
DR. KEPNER, UM,
WE'RE SWAMPED,

03:50.431 --> 03:53.003
AND I HAVE
A SHORTNESS-OF-BREATH LADY

03:53.003 --> 03:54.335
WHO NEEDS A CONSULT,

03:54.335 --> 03:55.736
AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE
BETTER THINGS TO DO,

03:55.736 --> 03:58.238
BUT I NEED HELP, PLEASE.
I'M DROWNING HERE.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.410
WHAT BED?

03:59.410 --> 04:00.711
ONE, TWO, THREE--

04:00.711 --> 04:01.872
WHAT ARE YOU--STOP IT.

04:01.872 --> 04:03.013
EDWARDS, IF YOU'RE COVERING
THE PIT,

04:03.013 --> 04:05.316
IT IS YOUR JOB TO KNOW
EVERY BED IN THE PIT.

04:05.316 --> 04:07.818
(sighs) OKAY.
PUT ON YOUR BIG-GIRL PANTS.

04:07.818 --> 04:09.980
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEARN
HOW TO RUN THE PIT. LET'S GO.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.583
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

04:12.583 --> 04:14.925
(sighs) I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE WAIT, MA'AM.

04:14.925 --> 04:16.287
YOU'RE EXPERIENCING
SHORTNESS OF BREATH?

04:16.287 --> 04:18.959
LUCKILY, NO.
45 MINUTES IN AN E.R. BED

04:18.959 --> 04:20.961
BEFORE A DOCTOR
PULLS OUT A STETHOSCOPE?

04:20.961 --> 04:23.033
I'D LIKELY BE EXPERIENCING
SHORTNESS OF LIFE.

04:23.033 --> 04:24.835
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:24.835 --> 04:27.338
ALANA CAHILL.
I'M A PHYSICIAN ADVISOR.

04:27.338 --> 04:28.899
COULD YOU POINT ME
TOWARDS CHIEF HUNT?

04:28.899 --> 04:32.443
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE MADE ME LATE
FOR A MEETING.

04:32.443 --> 04:34.274
MY BAD.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.847
(crying) IT'S LIKE
A KNIFE IS STABBING ME.

04:36.847 --> 04:38.379
YOU'RE SURE
IT ISN'T EARLY LABOR?

04:38.379 --> 04:39.650
BECAUSE IF IT IS, I'M GONNA
NEED TO CALL MY SISTER

04:39.650 --> 04:41.281
AND HAVE HER BRING ME
MY MAKEUP BAG.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.053
I'M DETERMINED TO LOOK CUTER
THAN THE BABY IN THE PICTURES.

04:43.053 --> 04:44.485
HEIDI.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.417
SORRY, HONEY.
I BABBLE WHEN I'M NERVOUS.

04:46.417 --> 04:48.018
BRIE HATES IT.
SHE'S THE QUIET ONE.

04:48.018 --> 04:49.960
AAH!
USUALLY.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.792
OKAY, WELL,
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT LABOR,

04:51.792 --> 04:52.963
BECAUSE I'M NOT SEEING
ANY CONTRACTIONS.

04:52.963 --> 04:54.725
AND THE BABY'S HEART RATE
IS GOOD.

04:54.725 --> 04:55.926
DID YOU HEAR THAT, HONEY?
THE BABY'S FINE.

04:55.926 --> 04:57.468
(door opens)
THEN WHAT IS GOING ON?

04:57.468 --> 04:58.799
(Meredith)
THERE'S A FEW POSSIBILITIES.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.970
THE LABS SHOULD HELP CLARIFY.
(door closes)

04:59.970 --> 05:01.502
ROSS, DID YOU GET
THAT CHEM-18 I ORDERED?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.834
UM, I THOUGHT I CHECKED OFF
THAT BOX,

05:03.834 --> 05:05.906
BUT APPARENTLY I CHECKED
CHEM-7.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.037
MY MISTAKE,
WHICH I'LL QUICKLY FIX.

05:07.037 --> 05:08.839
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'LL LEAVE YOU

05:08.839 --> 05:10.441
THE LAB WORK
I DIDN'T FORGET.

05:10.441 --> 05:12.813
I GUESS HE BABBLES
WHEN HE'S NERVOUS, TOO.
(door opens)

05:12.813 --> 05:14.915
AH!
OKAY, OKAY.

05:14.915 --> 05:15.946
(door closes)
AH! (pants)

05:15.946 --> 05:17.488
(African accent)
EVERYONE AT NAMBOZE

05:17.488 --> 05:18.789
WAS SO WORRIED WHEN WE HEARD

05:18.789 --> 05:20.320
THE PROGRAM MIGHT MOVE
TO U.C.L.A.,

05:20.320 --> 05:21.952
MYSELF INCLUDED.

05:21.952 --> 05:24.024
YOU MAKE THE KIDS FEEL
SO AT HOME HERE.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.956
(Alex) WELL, WE WERE NEVER
GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

05:25.956 --> 05:27.728
(Arizona) NO, I WAS AWAY,
BUT NOW I'M BACK.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.029
AND AS LONG AS DR. KAREV
AND I ARE HERE,

05:29.029 --> 05:30.861
THEN THE PROGRAM STAYS HERE.

05:30.861 --> 05:32.533
OKAY, UM,
NYAH'S PERICARDITIS

05:32.533 --> 05:33.964
IS QUITE SEVERE.
(wheels roll)

05:33.964 --> 05:35.806
THE PERICARDIAL SAC
AROUND HER HEART IS INFLAMED

05:35.806 --> 05:38.369
AND STARTING TO ADHERE
TO THE HEART ITSELF.

05:38.369 --> 05:40.070
SO I'LL PERFORM WHAT'S CALLED
PERICARDIAL STRIPPING.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.612
SO I'LL REMOVE THE SAC,

05:41.612 --> 05:43.644
AND HER HEART WILL START
BEATING ON ITS OWN AGAIN.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.945
WHAT SHALL I TELL HER?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.577
(Alex) OH, TELL HER
WE'RE GONNA FIX HER HEART,

05:46.577 --> 05:48.719
AND SHE'LL BREATHE
MUCH BETTER.

05:48.719 --> 05:52.082
(speaking African dialect)

05:52.082 --> 05:53.654
NICE PROGRAM.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.825
SHAME TO SEE IT GO.

05:54.825 --> 05:56.126
THANKS. WAIT. WHAT?

05:56.126 --> 05:58.729
WE'RE GETTING A VISIT
FROM THE EFFICIENCY FAIRY.

05:58.729 --> 06:00.591
YOU THINK SHE'S NOT GONNA
MAKE THIS DISAPPEAR?

06:00.591 --> 06:01.862
LOOK, SHUT UP.
WE JUST GOT IT BACK.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.033
SHE'S TRIMMING FAT.

06:03.033 --> 06:04.565
YOU'RE FLYING KIDS
ACROSS THE WORLD

06:04.565 --> 06:05.836
FOR A PRO BONO SURGERY.

06:05.836 --> 06:07.367
THAT'S PRETTY FATTY.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.699
YEAH, THEY'RE ORPHANS.

06:08.699 --> 06:09.840
(elevator bell dings)

06:09.840 --> 06:12.403
WELL, NOW YOU'RE JUST
MAKING MY POINT.

06:13.644 --> 06:15.906
(monitor beeping erratically)
OH, MY GOD.

06:15.906 --> 06:17.077
MAC 3
AND CRICOID PRESSURE.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.879
IS SHE OKAY?
E.T. TUBE.

06:18.879 --> 06:19.850
YEAH, START HER ON 10 MICS
OF DOPAMINE,

06:19.850 --> 06:21.011
AND WHERE ARE THE DAMN LABS?

06:21.011 --> 06:23.554
HERE.
SHE'S IN LIVER FAILURE.

06:23.554 --> 06:24.955
TALK TO ME, BAILEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:24.955 --> 06:26.557
YEAH, UH, ROSS IS RIGHT.

06:26.557 --> 06:28.018
BRIE'S LIVER WON'T LAST
ANOTHER WEEK.

06:28.018 --> 06:29.990
I JUST WENT
TO THE GIFT SHOP.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.121
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:33.464 --> 06:49.540
(beeping continues)

06:50.410 --> 06:51.812
IS THIS BECAUSE OF
THE BABY?

06:51.812 --> 06:53.484
NO, NO, NO. IT APPEARS TO BE
UNRELATED TO THE PREGNANCY.

06:53.484 --> 06:56.717
BRIE'S LIVER STOPPED FILTERING
OUT TOXINS,

06:56.717 --> 06:58.048
SO HER BODY'S SHUTTING DOWN.

06:58.048 --> 07:00.521
WITHOUT A TRANSPLANT,
HER LIVER MAY NOT LAST 72 HOURS.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.192
DON'T PEOPLE WAIT YEARS
FOR A LIVER?

07:02.192 --> 07:03.894
NOT ALWAYS.
IN EMERGENCY CASES LIKE THIS,

07:03.894 --> 07:05.656
PATIENTS GET MOVED
TO THE TOP OF THE LIST.

07:05.656 --> 07:06.827
SO WE'VE NOTIFIED U.N.O.S.,

07:06.827 --> 07:08.428
AND AS SOON AS THEY HAVE
A LIVER...

07:08.428 --> 07:09.760
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT ABOUT
THE BABY?

07:09.760 --> 07:11.532
THE BABY IS PERFECTLY FINE
FOR NOW.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.534
SO NOW WE JUST WAIT,
OKAY?

07:13.534 --> 07:14.535
OKAY.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.508
(telephone ringing)

07:17.508 --> 07:18.909
DO NOT...

07:18.909 --> 07:20.611
SAY ANYTHING.

07:20.611 --> 07:22.573
I AM SO... SO SORRY.

07:22.573 --> 07:23.544
WOW!

07:23.544 --> 07:25.015
IS THIS YOU
NOT SAYING ANYTHING?

07:25.015 --> 07:26.517
(pants)

07:26.517 --> 07:28.178
(voice breaking) GO AWAY

07:28.178 --> 07:29.720
AND DO NOT COME BACK

07:29.720 --> 07:31.151
WITHOUT A LIVER.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.883
UM, CAN I GET YOU
A TISSUE?

07:32.883 --> 07:35.085
GO!

07:35.085 --> 07:36.226
(man) HEY, THERE'S MY GUY.

07:36.226 --> 07:39.229
JIMMY. HEY, CARLA.
HOW ARE YOU?

07:39.229 --> 07:40.561
PLEASE SAY YOU'RE NOT
STILL MARRIED.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.862
AH, AFRAID SO.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.534
IGNORE MY SISTER.
NO BOUNDARIES.
AH.

07:43.534 --> 07:45.235
YOU THINK SHE CARES?
UNLESS SHE'S THE WIFE.

07:45.235 --> 07:46.737
YOU THE WIFE?

07:46.737 --> 07:48.599
OH, NO. YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR.
HEADACHES STILL BAD?

07:48.599 --> 07:50.240
(Carla) HE CAN BARELY GET OFF
THE COUCH, HE'S SO DIZZY.
(clicks)

07:50.240 --> 07:53.043
MEANWHILE, I HAVE TO WAIT
ON HIM LIKE HE'S THE BOY PRINCE.

07:53.043 --> 07:54.545
WARMS YOUR HEART,
DOESN'T SHE?

07:54.545 --> 07:55.506
YEAH. WILSON, WHAT ARE SOME
OF THE OTHER SYMPTOMS

07:55.506 --> 07:56.747
OF AN ACOUSTIC NEUROMA?

07:56.747 --> 07:58.609
HEARING LOSS,
INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE,

07:58.609 --> 07:59.610
TINGLING IN THE FACE--

07:59.610 --> 08:01.011
AND BEING A GIANT PAIN
IN MY ASS.

08:01.011 --> 08:03.584
I TRIED TO FIND ANOTHER SURGEON
WHILE YOUR HAND HEALED.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.485
TURNS OUT, NO ONE WILL GO
ANYWHERE NEAR THIS THING.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.987
(Derek) WELL, WE'RE GONNA
RUN SOME SCANS

08:06.987 --> 08:08.158
AND SOME LABS

08:08.158 --> 08:09.520
AND SEE IF THE TUMOR
HAS PROGRESSED.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.861
YOU MEAN,
IT COULD BE WORSE?

08:10.861 --> 08:13.564
WELL, WE'LL HAVE A CLEARER IDEA
ONCE WE SEE THE SCANS.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.596
SEE IF YOU CAN SWITCH
WITH ROSS.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.167
OH. DID I--

08:17.167 --> 08:18.829
NO, IT'S NOTHING
YOU DID WRONG.

08:18.829 --> 08:20.571
IT'S THAT ROSS KNOWS WHAT I WANT
BEFORE I EVEN ASK FOR IT.

08:20.571 --> 08:22.172
I WON'T HAVE TIME
TO TEACH YOU ON THIS ONE.

08:22.172 --> 08:23.604
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

08:23.604 --> 08:25.936
SHEPHERD,
THIS IS ALANA CAHILL.

08:25.936 --> 08:27.107
SHE IS OUR PHYSICIAN ADVISOR.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.609
DEREK SHEPHERD.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.681
NEURO. I SAW YOU'RE DOING
AN ACOUSTIC NEUROMA.

08:30.681 --> 08:32.282
VERY EXCITING.
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

08:32.282 --> 08:33.644
PATIENT'S HERE TODAY.

08:33.644 --> 08:34.945
MM.

08:34.945 --> 08:36.286
ARE PRE-OP OVERNIGHT STAYS
TYPICAL IN ALL DEPARTMENTS?

08:36.286 --> 08:37.517
THAT IS A QUESTION
FOR CHIEF HUNT.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.990
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO PREP.

08:39.990 --> 08:42.122
HMM. WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE O.R. TOMORROW.

08:43.794 --> 08:45.295
TYPICALLY,
YOU NEED TO BE INVITED.

08:45.295 --> 08:46.627
IF THINGS
WERE RUNNING TYPICALLY,

08:46.627 --> 08:48.629
I WOULDN'T BE HERE,
NOW WOULD I?

08:50.060 --> 08:52.302
(Owen clears throat)

08:52.302 --> 08:54.665
(clears throat) OKAY.

08:54.665 --> 08:56.637
BRIAN TURNER, AGE 55.
(siren wailing in distance)

08:56.637 --> 08:58.709
MINOR HEAD INJURY.
VITAL SIGNS STABLE.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.971
FELL OFF THE DAMN LADDER
CLEANING THE DAMN GUTTER.

09:00.971 --> 09:02.573
I WAS GONNA SAY ALL THAT.
FEWER DAMNS.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.174
YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW IF HE LOST
CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE FIELD.

09:04.174 --> 09:06.316
SIR, DID YOU LOSE
CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE FIELD?

09:06.316 --> 09:08.248
I DIDN'T FALL IN A DAMN FIELD.
I FELL IN MY DAMN YARD.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.920
ASK THE PARAMEDIC,
NOT THE PATIENT.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.652
OH, HE WAS CONSCIOUS
THE WHOLE DAMN TIME.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.983
UM, COULD WE JUST
START OVER?

09:12.983 --> 09:15.185
UH, NO TIME.
GET HIM TRIAGED. GO.

09:15.185 --> 09:17.828
45 MINUTES IN AN E.R. BED
BEFORE I SAW A DOCTOR.

09:17.828 --> 09:19.590
WELL, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

09:19.590 --> 09:21.632
NO, IT'S NOT.

09:21.632 --> 09:23.634
ALANA CAHILL?

09:23.634 --> 09:24.935
UH, DR. WEBBER.

09:24.935 --> 09:26.667
(laughs)

09:26.667 --> 09:29.169
WOW. UH, ALANA WAS
A STUDENT OF MINE,

09:29.169 --> 09:30.340
UH, HOW MANY YEARS
AGO NOW?

09:30.340 --> 09:31.742
OH, DO WE REALLY
HAVE TO SAY?

09:31.742 --> 09:34.304
SHE WAS A GREAT STUDENT
AND A GIFTED SURGEON.

09:34.304 --> 09:36.076
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU BACK?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.608
YOU LOOKING
AT JOINING THE STAFF?

09:37.608 --> 09:40.250
UH, SHE IS THE PHYSICIAN ADVISOR
THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

09:40.250 --> 09:41.612
(elevator bell dings)

09:41.612 --> 09:42.883
AH.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.585
UM, WELL, WE SHOULD GET
A CUP OF COFFEE, CATCH UP.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.358
I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I'M PRETTY BOOKED.

09:48.358 --> 09:50.060
IN FACT, WE SHOULD
GET GOING.
MM-HMM.

09:50.060 --> 09:52.623
O-OF COURSE.
IT WAS, UH, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

09:54.164 --> 09:56.296
YOUR HERO SENT ME
TO TRADE SERVICES WITH YOU.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.028
YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:58.028 --> 10:00.170
CAN'T. I'M WAITING FOR
U.N.O.S. TO CALL WITH A LIVER.

10:00.170 --> 10:01.331
SO GO WAIT IN THE O.R.

10:01.331 --> 10:02.833
WHILE YOU PLAY
TEACHER'S PET WITH SHEPHERD.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.174
I'M NOT MOVING FROM
THIS SPOT.

10:04.174 --> 10:05.736
GREAT CELL RECEPTION.
SEE? FIVE BARS.

10:05.736 --> 10:07.377
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE
ORDERING A PIZZA, RIGHT?

10:07.377 --> 10:08.909
IT COULD TAKE DAYS.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.210
MY PATIENT DOESN'T HAVE DAYS.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.742
OKAY, FINE. I'LL WAIT.

10:11.742 --> 10:13.844
AND WHEN U.N.O.S. CALLS,
I'LL RUN TO MEDUSA. I PROMISE.

10:13.844 --> 10:15.886
GIVE ME MY PHONE.

10:15.886 --> 10:17.347
IF I MISS THE CALL,
GREY IS GONNA KILL ME.

10:17.347 --> 10:18.889
IF I GO BACK TO SHEPHERD
AND I'M NOT YOU,

10:18.889 --> 10:20.220
HE'S GONNA KILL ME.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.352
GIVE ME MY PHONE.
(cell phone rings)

10:22.352 --> 10:23.724
OH, MY GOD.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.895
GIVE ME MY PHONE.

10:24.895 --> 10:26.226
(rings and beeps)
HELLO?

10:26.226 --> 10:29.059
(Cristina)
THE PERICARDIUM IS FREE.

10:29.059 --> 10:31.401
YOU SHOULD SEE AN INCREASE
IN, UH, CARDIAC FUNCTION.

10:31.401 --> 10:32.863
IT'S WEIRD. HEART'S FLOPPY.

10:32.863 --> 10:34.404
STILL NOT THE WAY
A KID'S HEART SHOULD LOOK.

10:34.404 --> 10:36.366
MM. COULD BE ENDOCARDITIS.

10:36.366 --> 10:37.367
I'LL DO A BIOPSY.

10:37.367 --> 10:39.369
UH, BIOPSY NEEDLE, PLEASE.

10:39.369 --> 10:41.211
UNLESS IT'S...

10:41.211 --> 10:42.873
OH, MY GOD.
IT COULDN'T, COULD IT?

10:42.873 --> 10:45.375
COULD THIS BE
ENDOMYOCARDIAL FIBROSIS?

10:45.375 --> 10:48.348
I-I'VE ONLY READ ABOUT IT.
IT'S RARE, SUBTROPICAL.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.950
COULD THIS BE THAT?
MAYBE.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.082
REMEMBER WE HAD THAT KID
WITH PENTALOGY OF CANTRELL?

10:52.082 --> 10:54.254
THIS PROGRAM...

10:54.254 --> 10:56.356
IS A MEDICAL FREAK SHOW
GOLDMINE.
(breathing heavily)

10:56.356 --> 10:58.028
(whispers) THEY CAN'T CUT IT.

10:58.028 --> 10:59.760
NOBODY'S CUTTING IT. ROBBINS,
TELL HER TO STOP SAYING THAT.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.331
(groans) I'M SORRY. WHAT?

11:01.331 --> 11:03.293
YOU ALL RIGHT?
UH-HUH.

11:03.293 --> 11:04.965
OKAY, UM, TAKE THAT TO PATH.
STAT, PLEASE.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.296
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL TAKE IT.

11:06.296 --> 11:07.898
ALEX, YOU TAKE MY PLACE.
THE NURSE CAN TAKE IT.

11:07.898 --> 11:09.269
NO, I'D RATHER TAKE IT MYSELF.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.801
OHH.

11:10.801 --> 11:12.672
(door opens)

11:12.672 --> 11:14.174
OHH.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.977
(panting)

11:16.977 --> 11:18.809
(groans)

11:18.809 --> 11:20.310
(exhales)

11:22.082 --> 11:24.454
(exhales and moans)

11:31.992 --> 11:34.024
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

11:34.024 --> 11:36.727
ARE THERE PASTRIES

11:36.727 --> 11:38.368
AND BAGELS IN EVERY ONE
OF YOUR LOUNGES?

11:38.368 --> 11:40.731
(Owen) NO. WELL, MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW.

11:40.731 --> 11:42.733
IS THAT THE KIND OF THING
YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT?

11:42.733 --> 11:45.705
I WILL BE LOOKING
AT EVERYTHING, DOCTOR.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.437
HUH. UM, DR. ROBBINS.

11:47.437 --> 11:49.079
THIS IS ALANA CAHILL.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.242
OH. UH,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

11:52.242 --> 11:54.915
MM-HMM. I'M FINE.
I'M SORRY.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.086
I...

11:56.086 --> 11:57.748
COULD YOU JUST GIVE US
A MINUTE?

11:57.748 --> 12:00.190
OF COURSE.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.425
(door closes)

12:05.425 --> 12:07.427
THAT WAS THE EFFICIENCY LADY,
RIGHT?

12:07.427 --> 12:10.260
YEAH, SO I PROBABLY LOOK
AS CRAZY AS A BAG OF CATS.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.732
SO IT WAS NICE WORKING
WITH YOU.

12:14.164 --> 12:16.937
(sighs)

12:16.937 --> 12:19.409
IS IT PHANTOM LIMB PAIN?

12:19.409 --> 12:21.111
CALLIE SAID IT ONLY HAPPENS
AT NIGHT.

12:21.111 --> 12:22.272
UNTIL NOW.

12:22.272 --> 12:24.815
I'M GOING CRAZY. I--

12:24.815 --> 12:26.476
YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

12:26.476 --> 12:29.780
PHANTOM LIMB
IS A VERY REAL THING.

12:29.780 --> 12:32.352
I JUST LEFT A SURGERY
BECAUSE THERE WAS PAIN

12:32.352 --> 12:34.224
IN A PART OF ME
THAT NO LONGER EXISTS.

12:34.224 --> 12:36.456
SO I--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:36.456 --> 12:40.230
WE'RE HELPING YOU VISUALIZE
A LEG THAT DOESN'T HURT.

12:40.230 --> 12:41.892
HERE WE GO. NOW...

12:41.892 --> 12:43.263
JUST LOOK AT THAT.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.895
I... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

12:44.895 --> 12:46.466
WE ARE REROUTING YOUR BRAIN,

12:46.466 --> 12:48.398
REMINDING IT
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

12:48.398 --> 12:50.170
THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS
FOR PHANTOM LIMB.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.342
THERE'S HEAT,
THERE'S MASSAGE,

12:52.342 --> 12:54.174
THERE'S
VIRTUAL REALITY THERAPY.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.376
I KNEW A GUY IN THE ARMY
WHO HAD TO STAB HIS PROSTHETIC

12:56.376 --> 12:58.178
WITH A SCREWDRIVER
AS HARD...
OH, GREAT.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.509
AS HE COULD.

12:59.509 --> 13:00.981
WELL, THAT'S NOT CRAZY.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.053
WELL, FOR HIM, IT WAS
THE ONLY THING THAT WORKED.

13:03.053 --> 13:05.055
NOW...

13:05.055 --> 13:06.817
IS YOUR PAIN ANY BETTER?

13:10.490 --> 13:13.293
Y-YE--IT IS, A-A-A LITTLE.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.496
YOU SEE? YOU JUST NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.369
CALLIE KNOWS ALL THIS.
WHAT DOES SHE SAY?

13:19.369 --> 13:21.431
I HA--I HAVEN'T TOLD HER.

13:21.431 --> 13:23.133
SHE'S AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON.

13:23.133 --> 13:27.237
AND I HAVE BEEN HER PATIENT
FOR SO LONG.

13:27.237 --> 13:29.079
AND I JUST AM STARTING
TO FEEL LIKE A WIFE AGAIN,

13:29.079 --> 13:32.042
AND SHE NEEDS ME TO.
I CANNOT HAVE THIS.

13:32.042 --> 13:34.014
I AM FINALLY GETTING
MY LIFE BACK TOGETHER,

13:34.014 --> 13:35.515
AND--AND I WILL NOT BE
SCREWED OVER

13:35.515 --> 13:37.447
BY SOMETHING
THAT'S NOT EVEN THERE!

13:40.450 --> 13:42.452
ALL RIGHT.

13:42.452 --> 13:44.124
WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.126
WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER,
AND I'M GONNA HELP YOU,

13:46.126 --> 13:48.158
AND WE ARE GONNA
FIGURE THIS OUT.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.302
OKAY?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.536
AFRICAN BABIES
ARE A GODSEND.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.538
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TELL ME.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.240
OH, NOT ZOLA.
NOT THE CUTE ONES.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.371
THE SICK ONES.

14:01.371 --> 14:03.073
THEY'RE
EXOTICALLY DISEASED,

14:03.073 --> 14:04.544
BEAUTIFUL
LITTLE TRAIN WRECKS.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.946
I JUST FOUND
A CASE OF E.M.F.,

14:05.946 --> 14:07.447
AND I GET TO DO
AN ENDOCARDIAL STRIPPING

14:07.447 --> 14:08.879
OF THE LEFT VENTRICLE.

14:08.879 --> 14:10.520
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY OTHER
PEOPLE HAVE DONE THAT?

14:10.520 --> 14:12.222
NO.
ME NEITHER.
IT'S UNHEARD OF.

14:12.222 --> 14:13.553
(elevator bell dings)
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:13.553 --> 14:15.055
I HAVE TO SEE A MAN
ABOUT A LIVER.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.027
DR. BAILEY.

14:17.027 --> 14:19.059
(siren wailing in distance)

14:19.059 --> 14:22.492
CAN I PLEASE
GET ANOTHER INTERN?

14:22.492 --> 14:24.194
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ROSS?

14:24.194 --> 14:25.365
(telephone ringing)
A LOT.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.866
THE KID MADE
A TINY MISTAKE.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.438
BECAUSE HE'S AN IDIOT.

14:28.438 --> 14:30.240
IF I HAVE TO WORK WITH HIM
ONE MORE SECOND,

14:30.240 --> 14:31.541
I'M PROBABLY GONNA KILL HIM.

14:31.541 --> 14:33.243
UH, YOU THINK I DIDN'T
WANT TO KILL YOU?

14:33.243 --> 14:35.305
YOU CUT L-VAD WIRES,
AND YET THERE YOU STAND.

14:35.305 --> 14:38.508
SO... BE MERCIFUL
AND SUCK IT UP.

14:38.508 --> 14:40.110
(scribbling)

14:40.110 --> 14:43.253
COUSIN DORA SENT HIM
A STUPID GIANT COOKIE,

14:43.253 --> 14:44.384
BUT HE CAN'T EAT
BEFORE SURGERY.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.386
SO NOW I'M STARVING
AND I GOTTA LOOK

14:46.386 --> 14:48.188
AT THIS GIANT FREAKIN' COOKIE
THAT I CAN'T HAVE!

14:48.188 --> 14:50.020
I KEEP JUST TELLING HER
TO EAT THE DAMN THING.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.561
OH, SO YOU CAN MAKE
FAT JOKES?

14:51.561 --> 14:52.923
THEN THROW IT AWAY.
JIMMY--

14:52.923 --> 14:55.565
OH, NO. WHAT'S THAT LOOK?
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:55.565 --> 14:58.468
THE TUMOR'S PROGRESSED.

14:58.468 --> 15:01.331
BUT YOU COULD
STILL OPERATE, RIGHT?

15:01.331 --> 15:02.472
YES, WE CAN,

15:02.472 --> 15:04.474
BUT ALL THOSE RISKS
WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE--

15:04.474 --> 15:06.006
LIKE ME GOING DEAF...
MM-HMM.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.537
OR HALF MY FACE BEING MELTED
LIKE IT WAS BLOWTORCHED,

15:07.537 --> 15:09.009
OR ME NOT SURVIVING AT ALL?

15:09.009 --> 15:10.640
YEAH, THE CHANCES
OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENING

15:10.640 --> 15:12.182
ARE MUCH HIGHER.

15:12.182 --> 15:14.084
SO... YOU SHOULD
TAKE SOME TIME

15:14.084 --> 15:16.616
AND THINK ABOUT IF YOU STILL
WANT TO DO THE SURGERY.

15:16.616 --> 15:20.320
I'VE TAKEN TIME.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.422
I WAITED FOR MONTHS
FOR YOU TO GET BETTER.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.954
DOC, I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE

15:23.954 --> 15:25.355
AND WAIT FOR THIS THING
TO KILL ME.

15:25.355 --> 15:26.926
(chuckles) I...

15:28.328 --> 15:30.030
(laughs)

15:30.030 --> 15:31.501
I'M DYING,
SHE MAKES IT ABOUT HER.

15:31.501 --> 15:34.504
(sighs)

15:36.536 --> 15:38.138
(whispers) HEY.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.270
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T LET HIM SEE ME CRY.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.172
I'LL NEVER HEAR
THE END OF IT.

15:42.172 --> 15:43.343
NO, IT'S OKAY.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.474
IT'S A HORRIBLE THING
TO SAY, I KNOW,

15:44.474 --> 15:45.615
BUT WHEN I HEARD
YOU WERE IN A PLANE CRASH,

15:45.615 --> 15:47.347
PART OF ME WAS RELIEVED.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.648
IT'S AN AWFUL THING
THAT HAPPENED TO YOU,

15:48.648 --> 15:50.180
AND I'M SO SORRY.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.622
BUT IT GAVE ME MORE TIME
WITH MY BROTHER.

15:52.622 --> 15:56.056
THESE PAST MONTHS HAVE BEEN
THE BEST WE'VE HAD.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.128
(sniffles)

15:58.128 --> 15:59.429
I'M READY.

15:59.429 --> 16:00.991
WE BOTH ARE.

16:05.235 --> 16:06.466
(inhales deeply)

16:06.466 --> 16:08.198
HERE'S THE RECHECK

16:08.198 --> 16:10.140
ON THE CALCIUM LEVEL
YOU ASKED FOR.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.502
ROSS IS GONE, SIR.
I'M SORRY.

16:12.502 --> 16:15.405
HE AND DR. GREY
WENT TO GO GET A LIVER.

16:15.405 --> 16:17.147
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
IN THE GALLERY.

16:17.147 --> 16:19.449
I DON'T NEED AN AUDIENCE.

16:19.449 --> 16:20.750
YOU UP FOR THIS?

16:20.750 --> 16:23.413
MM-HMM.

16:24.754 --> 16:26.256
(exhales deeply)

16:26.256 --> 16:30.390
(siren wailing)

16:30.390 --> 16:32.492
(horn blares)

16:38.068 --> 16:41.371
I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
THE THING WITH THE LABS,

16:41.371 --> 16:42.532
IT WON'T EVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

16:42.532 --> 16:44.674
OKAY. JUST LET IT GO,
OKAY?

16:44.674 --> 16:46.706
(wailing continues)

16:46.706 --> 16:48.408
CONGRATS ON THE BABY.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.509
THANK YOU.

16:49.509 --> 16:54.244
YOU MUST BE, WHAT,
THREE MONTHS IN?

16:54.244 --> 16:56.246
BABY'S THE SIZE
OF A LEMON.

16:56.246 --> 16:57.417
(exhales deeply)

16:57.417 --> 17:00.420
SO... SECOND TRIMESTER,
HUH?

17:00.420 --> 17:01.721
(wailing continues)

17:01.721 --> 17:03.723
THE FETUS IS GROWING FEET...
(sighs)

17:03.723 --> 17:06.326
DISCHARGING URINE
INTO THE AMNIOTIC FLUID.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.199
AND YOU MUST BE
FEELING BETTER,

17:09.199 --> 17:10.500
LESS NAUSEA.

17:12.162 --> 17:14.504
BUT THE SECOND TRIMESTER'S
ALSO KNOWN TO BRING WITH IT

17:14.504 --> 17:19.139
SWOLLEN GUMS,
HEARTBURN, GAS--

17:19.139 --> 17:21.571
DO YOU WANT ME
TO START CRYING?!

17:21.571 --> 17:23.673
(wailing continues,
horn blaring)

17:23.673 --> 17:25.575
(sighs deeply)

17:25.575 --> 17:28.047
AND ON THREE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.549
(grunts)

17:29.549 --> 17:31.521
LAST B.P. WAS 110 OVER 70,

17:31.521 --> 17:33.123
BUT THERE WAS
SIGNIFICANT DASHBOARD DAMAGE.

17:33.123 --> 17:34.454
STOP. DR. EDWARDS, WHAT INJURIES
ARE WE MOST CONCERNED WITH

17:34.454 --> 17:35.625
IN THIS PATIENT?

17:35.625 --> 17:36.786
WE ALWAYS START
WITH THE ABCs.

17:36.786 --> 17:38.258
IF YOU'D BEEN LISTENING
TO THE PARAMEDIC,

17:38.258 --> 17:39.489
YOU'D HAVE YOUR ANSWER.
CAN YOU START OVER?

17:39.489 --> 17:41.531
THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE
TO THE DASHBOARD--

17:41.531 --> 17:43.163
WHAT'S THE BASIC LAW
OF MOTION, EDWARDS?

17:43.163 --> 17:44.334
THE BASIC--

17:44.334 --> 17:45.465
ENERGY CANNOT BE CREATED
OR DESTROYED,

17:45.465 --> 17:46.596
BUT CAN CHANGE IN FORM
OR BE ABSORBED.

17:46.596 --> 17:48.398
UH, WHICH MEANS THE IMPACT
TO THE DASHBOARD

17:48.398 --> 17:49.799
WAS ABSORBED BY THE PATIENT.

17:49.799 --> 17:51.471
SO THE INJURIES WE'RE
MOST CONCERNED WITH ARE?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.303
ARE KNEE INJURY,
POSSIBLE PELVIS, C-SPINE.

17:53.303 --> 17:54.544
CORRECT.

17:54.544 --> 17:56.176
MATTHEW HERE STABILIZED
THE PELVIS IN THE FIELD.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.577
UH, IT REALLY WASN'T
THAT BIG OF A--

17:57.577 --> 17:58.808
SO NOW YOU CAN START
YOUR EXAM.

17:58.808 --> 18:00.510
(exhales)

18:00.510 --> 18:02.712
MM-HMM.
(monitor beeping steadily)

18:02.712 --> 18:07.517
SO I'LL JUST...
SEE MYSELF OUT THEN.

18:07.517 --> 18:09.219
OKAY. (sighs)

18:09.219 --> 18:10.860
(clears throat)

18:16.726 --> 18:18.728
OKAY, ROSS.
THERE'S THE KNOT.

18:18.728 --> 18:20.400
IT'S A NICE ONE.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.701
UH, OKAY.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.673
YES, THANK YOU.
SCISSORS.

18:23.673 --> 18:25.575
CAREFUL NOW.

18:25.575 --> 18:27.377
WE'RE JUST GONNA CUT
THE SUTURE

18:27.377 --> 18:29.279
AS CLOSE TO THE KNOT
AS POSSIBLE

18:29.279 --> 18:30.410
WITHOUT--
(snips)

18:30.410 --> 18:31.541
OH, NO.

18:31.541 --> 18:32.712
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

18:32.712 --> 18:34.544
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:34.544 --> 18:36.516
(instruments clattering)

18:36.516 --> 18:38.418
(squirt)
OH!

18:38.418 --> 18:40.520
YOU CUT THE HEPATIC ARTERY
IN THE HILUM.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.522
YOU CUT THE HILUM
BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE TO SAY,

18:42.522 --> 18:43.793
"DON'T CUT THE HILUM!"

18:43.793 --> 18:45.195
(man) YOU SEE WHAT HE DID?

18:45.195 --> 18:47.897
DON'T EVER DO THAT.

18:47.897 --> 18:49.499
(voice breaking) CLAMP.

18:49.499 --> 18:51.401
(cries)

18:51.401 --> 18:54.434
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

18:54.434 --> 18:57.136
I DON'T KNOW.
UM, DR. ROBBINS.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.308
HEY.

18:58.308 --> 18:59.669
EVERYTHING, UH,
WORK OUT ALL RIGHT?

18:59.669 --> 19:00.840
YEAH, I'M SORRY THAT
YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.272
IT WAS A-A PERSONAL--

19:02.272 --> 19:03.613
YOU WERE HAVING A MOMENT.
YEAH.

19:03.613 --> 19:04.774
WE ALL HAVE 'EM.

19:04.774 --> 19:06.746
JUST SUCKS WHEN THEY HAPPEN
AT WORK, RIGHT?

19:06.746 --> 19:09.179
I WAS, UH, JUST TELLING
DR. CAHILL

19:09.179 --> 19:10.520
HOW WELL
NYAH'S SURGERY WENT.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.751
YEAH.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.284
AND THAT YOU LET ME FINISH
THE SURGERY ON MY OWN.

19:14.284 --> 19:15.455
YEAH.
THANKS AGAIN.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.586
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE
FOR A FELLOW.

19:16.586 --> 19:19.259
OH, WELL, HE'S--
HE'S MORE THAN QUALIFIED.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.661
WELL, I WILL BE OBSERVING
NYAH'S SECOND SURGERY TOMORROW.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.663
SO WILL THAT BE YOU
OR DR. KAREV?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.365
OH, NO, ME, OF COURSE.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.637
YEAH. UH, WITH
OUR CARDIO FELLOW DR. YANG.

19:27.637 --> 19:29.499
ALL RIGHT.
I WILL SEE YOU THERE.

19:29.499 --> 19:31.771
OKAY.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.503
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:33.503 --> 19:35.675
NOTHING. I'M FINE.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.907
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS MORNING.
ARE WE ALL SET FOR TOMORROW?

19:37.907 --> 19:39.479
UH... (sighs) 8:30, O.R. 2.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.311
GREAT.

19:41.311 --> 19:42.612
UH, LOOK, IF YOU WANT
TO SIT IT OUT,

19:42.612 --> 19:44.954
YANG AND I CAN HANDLE IT.

19:44.954 --> 19:47.457
MAYBE, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

19:47.457 --> 19:49.459
IT'S JUST THAT YANG
KEEPS SQUAWKING ABOUT

19:49.459 --> 19:51.461
HOW THEY'RE GONNA
CUT THE PROGRAM,

19:51.461 --> 19:53.593
AND I JUST DON'T WANT
ANYTHING TO--

19:53.593 --> 19:55.625
YEAH. UM, ARE YOU FINISHED?

19:55.625 --> 19:57.297
I JUST WANT EVERYTHING
TO GO WELL.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.198
THEN I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW MORNING.

20:00.970 --> 20:02.772
(thunderclap)

20:02.772 --> 20:05.775
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

20:05.775 --> 20:08.608
10-BLADE, PLEASE.

20:12.542 --> 20:13.513
(ripping sound)

20:13.513 --> 20:15.685
AAH! AH!

20:15.685 --> 20:17.517
(pants)

20:17.517 --> 20:19.619
DID...

20:19.619 --> 20:22.492
DID YOU SEE THAT?

20:22.492 --> 20:24.394
(pants)

20:33.933 --> 20:35.435
(ripping)

20:35.435 --> 20:37.667
GOD! AH!

20:37.667 --> 20:39.539
AAH!

20:39.539 --> 20:40.840
(gasps)

20:42.272 --> 20:44.544
OH. (whimpers)

20:44.544 --> 20:46.015
(gasps)

20:46.015 --> 20:48.448
(monitor beeping erratically)

20:48.448 --> 20:51.621
(panting)

20:55.625 --> 20:57.527
(beeping continues)

20:57.527 --> 20:58.728
AAH!

20:58.728 --> 21:00.560
AAH! AAH!

21:00.560 --> 21:02.031
(grunts)

21:02.031 --> 21:03.533
(panting)

21:04.634 --> 21:06.736
AH! OH.

21:06.736 --> 21:09.739
(panting)

21:21.311 --> 21:22.482
(Callie yawns and sniffles)

21:22.482 --> 21:23.653
(footsteps approach)

21:23.653 --> 21:25.415
(singsongy) MORNING.

21:25.415 --> 21:26.786
(doorknob rattles)

21:26.786 --> 21:29.759
OH. YOU ALL RIGHT IN THERE?

21:29.759 --> 21:30.890
UM, YEAH.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.692
NO, I'M FINE. I'M FINE.
I WAS JUST--

21:32.692 --> 21:34.964
I'M ABOUT TO TAKE
A SHOWER.

21:34.964 --> 21:36.326
OH, WANT SOME COMPANY?

21:36.326 --> 21:37.627
UM, YEAH, OF COURSE I DO.

21:37.627 --> 21:39.999
IT'S JUST, I'M, UM,
I'M RUNNING LATE.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.671
SO HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

21:41.671 --> 21:43.633
YEAH. HOW ABOUT
A MOVIE NIGHT?

21:43.633 --> 21:45.535
YEAH. YOU READ MY MIND.

21:45.535 --> 21:47.737
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

21:47.737 --> 21:50.810
(siren wailing in distance)

21:54.784 --> 21:57.687
(Meredith) UNFORTUNATELY THERE
WAS A SURGICAL COMPLICATION

21:57.687 --> 21:59.919
WITH THE DONOR LIVER,
AND IT IS NO LONGER VIABLE.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.391
OH, GOD.

22:01.391 --> 22:03.022
OKAY. SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

22:03.022 --> 22:05.054
WELL, BRIE IS BACK
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

22:05.054 --> 22:08.027
WE'LL CONTINUE
SUPPORTIVE CARE

22:08.027 --> 22:09.759
SO HER BODY'S READY

22:09.759 --> 22:11.601
IF ANOTHER LIVER
BECOMES AVAILABLE

22:11.601 --> 22:13.763
OR IF WE HAVE TO DELIVER
THE BABY.

22:13.763 --> 22:14.964
A C-SECTION?

22:14.964 --> 22:16.506
CAN--CAN SHE HANDLE THAT?

22:16.506 --> 22:17.967
ANY SURGERY IS RISKY,

22:17.967 --> 22:20.610
AND HER CONDITION IS CAUSING
HER BLOOD TO STOP CLOTTING.

22:20.610 --> 22:23.072
SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE
WITH THE BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS

22:23.072 --> 22:26.345
AND BUY HER SOME TIME
UNTIL A LIVER BECOMES AVAILABLE.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.978
IF A NEW LIVER
BECOMES AVAILABLE.

22:28.978 --> 22:30.420
YES.

22:30.420 --> 22:31.751
OH, GOD.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.724
THE LAST THING I SAID TO HER IS,
"YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE."

22:34.724 --> 22:37.727
(cries) YOU HAVE TO
FIX HER, PLEASE.

22:37.727 --> 22:39.959
YEAH. HERE.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.792
YOU CAN SEE THAT SHE'S
STILL ON THE RESPIRATOR.

22:42.792 --> 22:45.795
(Miranda)
HER VITALS ACTUALLY...

22:45.795 --> 22:47.667
UH...

22:47.667 --> 22:49.539
I HOPE YOU WON'T MENTION

22:49.539 --> 22:52.702
MY COLOSSAL INCOMPETENCE
TO YOUR HUSBAND.

22:52.702 --> 22:55.004
HE... STILL THINKS
I'M THE GOLDEN BOY.

22:55.004 --> 22:57.447
NO, STOP THAT.
YOU DON'T GET TO DO THAT.

22:57.447 --> 22:59.449
YOU DON'T GET TO FEEL SORRY
FOR YOURSELF

22:59.449 --> 23:01.951
OR MAKE LITTLE
SELF-DEPRECATING REMARKS.

23:01.951 --> 23:04.854
YOU DESTROYED
A PERFECTLY GOOD LIVER TODAY.

23:04.854 --> 23:07.116
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU,
THAT IS ALL I SEE.

23:07.116 --> 23:08.518
A PERFECTLY...
(cell phone ringing)

23:08.518 --> 23:10.760
GOOD LIVER.
HOLD ON A SEC.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.523
I'M NOT DONE.
PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY.
I'M--I'M SORRY.

23:13.523 --> 23:14.724
DON'T BE SORRY.
BE BETTER.

23:14.724 --> 23:16.065
I THINK IT'S U.N.O.S.

23:16.065 --> 23:17.767
(rings)

23:17.767 --> 23:18.798
(slaps phone)

23:18.798 --> 23:21.030
(beep)

23:21.030 --> 23:22.502
HELLO.

23:22.502 --> 23:25.975
(indistinct conversations)

23:25.975 --> 23:28.177
HMM. CAN I HELP YOU
FIND SOMETHING?

23:28.177 --> 23:30.680
NO. I'M JUST OBSERVING
SURGERIES TODAY,

23:30.680 --> 23:33.513
AND I'M TRYING
TO MAXIMIZE MY TIME.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.085
SHEPHERD'S ACOUSTIC NEUROMA
IS AT 8:00,

23:36.085 --> 23:37.787
AND THAT'S GONNA BE A LONG ONE.

23:37.787 --> 23:39.519
JUST TRYING TO BE EVERYWHERE
AT ONCE.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.551
(clears throat)
ACTUALLY, SHEPHERD'S SURGERY

23:41.551 --> 23:43.653
GOT PUSHED TILL LATER.
(telephone rings)

23:45.495 --> 23:47.657
OH, I TOTALLY MISREAD THAT.

23:47.657 --> 23:50.059
THAT IS GOING TO WORK
SO MUCH BETTER FOR ME.

23:50.059 --> 23:51.731
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.062
(elevator bell dings)

23:53.062 --> 23:54.904
WELL, MAYBE THAT, UH,
GIVES US TIME FOR COFFEE.

23:54.904 --> 23:56.606
I'M AFRAID NOT.

23:56.606 --> 23:58.668
JUST TIME FOR ME
TO SEE MORE SURGERIES.

23:58.668 --> 24:02.472
WELL, I ALWAYS DID EXPECT
TO SEE YOU IN THE O.R.

24:02.472 --> 24:04.874
(chuckles)
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, RIGHT?

24:04.874 --> 24:06.175
(clears throat)

24:06.175 --> 24:07.717
(telephone continues ringing)

24:07.717 --> 24:09.048
RIGHT.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.652
(waves crashing)

24:12.652 --> 24:14.654
(Owen) OKAY, NOW BREATHE.

24:14.654 --> 24:15.885
(sea birds calling)

24:15.885 --> 24:17.587
(inhales and exhales)

24:17.587 --> 24:19.859
TRY TO CALM THE WAVES.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.561
TRY TO SLOW THEM DOWN.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.032
WHAT--
WHAT'S THE POINT HERE?

24:23.032 --> 24:24.864
WELL, THE IDEA IS,

24:24.864 --> 24:27.597
IF YOU CAN TEACH YOUR MIND
TO CALM THE WAVES,

24:27.597 --> 24:30.199
YOU CAN TEACH IT
TO... CALM THE PAIN.

24:30.199 --> 24:31.741
BUT I... (sighs)

24:31.741 --> 24:33.042
I-I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T DO IT.

24:33.042 --> 24:35.505
IT'S--THIS IS DUMB.

24:35.505 --> 24:37.947
THIS IS NOT DUMB.
IT IS BIOFEEDBACK.

24:37.947 --> 24:40.479
LOOK, I CAN'T--I CAN'T STOP
THE STUPID MAKE-BELIEVE WAVES.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.712
SO... WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

24:42.712 --> 24:45.154
WELL, I HAVE A MINIMALLY
INVASIVE SPINAL SURGERY

24:45.154 --> 24:46.856
THAT CAN
DEADEN YOUR NERVES.

24:46.856 --> 24:47.857
NO, NO,
I HAVE TO OPERATE TODAY.

24:47.857 --> 24:49.118
THEN I GOT
MAKE-BELIEVE WAVES,

24:49.118 --> 24:51.791
OR I GOT
A MAKE-BELIEVE WATERFALL,

24:51.791 --> 24:53.723
OR A MAKE-BELIEVE CAMPFIRE.

24:53.723 --> 24:54.864
OR I COULD
JUST FIND A SCREWDRIVER

24:54.864 --> 24:56.095
AND STAB IT IN YOUR FOOT.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.697
JUST STAB ME IN THE HEAD.

24:57.697 --> 24:58.868
(laughs)

24:58.868 --> 25:01.270
(sighs)

25:04.503 --> 25:08.137
C.T. RESULTS
ON PELVIC FRACTURE.

25:08.137 --> 25:10.179
THORACENTESIS
IF POSITIVE EFFUSION.

25:10.179 --> 25:13.512
UM,
MUSCULOAPONEUROTIC GRAFTS?

25:13.512 --> 25:14.984
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? (laughs)
WHAT AM I--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:14.984 --> 25:16.686
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING
TO TALK DIRTY.

25:16.686 --> 25:18.147
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE
THE ONLY GIANT NERD.

25:18.147 --> 25:19.689
I WAS TALKING OUT LOUD?

25:19.689 --> 25:21.290
YEAH. (chuckles)
(laughs)

25:21.290 --> 25:23.823
THOUGH I WAS WEIRDLY
KIND OF INTO IT.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.656
MM.

25:26.656 --> 25:29.629
UM, I HAVE 60 MILLION THINGS
TO DO TODAY,

25:29.629 --> 25:31.100
AND I'M SURE
I'M GONNA FORGET SOMETHING.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.632
KEPNER'S RUNNING ME RAGGED.

25:32.632 --> 25:35.304
AND THAT'S NOT WORKING
FOR ME ANYMORE.

25:35.304 --> 25:36.706
UM...

25:36.706 --> 25:38.938
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
TOO BUSY FOR THIS,

25:38.938 --> 25:40.109
WE CAN, UM...

25:40.109 --> 25:42.812
I AM NOT TOO BUSY
FOR THIS.

25:45.274 --> 25:46.716
MM.

25:46.716 --> 25:48.317
I AM TOO BUSY FOR THIS.

25:48.317 --> 25:49.819
ALL RIGHT.

25:49.819 --> 25:51.250
THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.683
OKAY.

25:53.683 --> 25:55.725
(sighs)

25:55.725 --> 25:59.058
(door opens)
HER LAST A.S.T.
WAS 23-42.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.830
I.N.R. WAS 6.

26:00.830 --> 26:01.891
(whispers)
IS IT VIABLE?

26:01.891 --> 26:02.932
(lowered voice)
I THINK IT'S A MATCH.

26:02.932 --> 26:04.563
SHE'D BE CRYING IF IT WASN'T.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.737
SHE CRIES WHEN SHE'S ANGRY,
WHICH IS WHENEVER SHE SEES ME.

26:07.737 --> 26:09.238
LOOK.

26:09.238 --> 26:10.800
SHE'S LOOKING AT ME
AND NOT CRYING.

26:10.800 --> 26:11.741
IT'S GOTTA BE A MATCH.

26:11.741 --> 26:14.243
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.

26:14.243 --> 26:15.605
(beep)
WE HAVE A MATCH.

26:15.605 --> 26:16.946
YOU'RE GONNA FLY
TO PORTLAND, OREGON.

26:16.946 --> 26:18.678
(normal voice) I WILL FLY
TO PORTLAND, OREGON,

26:18.678 --> 26:20.610
TO RETRIEVE A LIVER
FOR A WOMAN

26:20.610 --> 26:21.781
WHO I'VE ALREADY DESTROYED
ONE LIVER?

26:21.781 --> 26:23.582
IS THAT THE WISEST USE
OF OUR RESOURCES?

26:23.582 --> 26:26.585
I CAN'T. I CAN'T GET
ON A PLANE. YOU KNOW THAT.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.017
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
ON A PLANE.

26:28.017 --> 26:29.819
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU TRY AGAIN.

26:29.819 --> 26:32.591
THEIR PROCUREMENT TEAM IS
GOING TO DO ALL OF THE WORK.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.763
YOU KNOW GOOD AND WELL

26:33.763 --> 26:35.024
WE PREFER TO DO
THE RECOVERY OURSELVES.

26:35.024 --> 26:37.797
ALL HE HAS TO DO
IS CARRY A COOLER.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.028
MEREDITH.

26:39.028 --> 26:40.229
IF HE'S BEEN TO A PICNIC,
HE CAN HANDLE THIS.

26:40.229 --> 26:42.271
SHANE, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO A PICNIC?

26:42.271 --> 26:43.733
I'VE BEEN TO A PICNIC.

26:43.733 --> 26:44.974
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
HE'S BEEN TO A PICNIC.

26:44.974 --> 26:46.305
THESE WOMEN DESERVE
MORE EXPERIENCE

26:46.305 --> 26:48.838
THAN A FOOL WHO'S EATEN
A POTATO SALAD IN A PARK.

26:48.838 --> 26:50.139
SHE'S RIGHT. MAYBE I'M NOT
THE BEST PERSON--

26:50.139 --> 26:51.340
YOU'RE AN INTERN.

26:51.340 --> 26:52.812
OF COURSE
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE MISTAKES.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.715
BAD THINGS HAPPEN,
BUT YOU HAVE TO MOVE PAST IT.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.186
LEAVE IT BEHIND YOU,
THE SOONER THE BETTER,

26:57.186 --> 26:58.347
OR IT'LL EAT AWAY AT YOU

26:58.347 --> 26:59.719
AND STOP YOU
FROM MOVING FORWARD.

26:59.719 --> 27:00.920
SO JUST GET OVER YOURSELF.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.754
MOVE PAST IT, AND GET
YOUR BUTT ON THAT PLANE.

27:04.754 --> 27:07.326
SO... NOW I'M CONFUSED.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.159
WHO'S GOING TO PORTLAND?

27:10.159 --> 27:12.261
I CAN'T.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.736
YOU AND I
ARE GOING TO PORTLAND.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.708
(elevator bell dings)

27:18.708 --> 27:20.169
(suction gurgling)
MM. OKAY.

27:20.169 --> 27:22.812
SO, WILSON,
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

27:22.812 --> 27:25.845
CEREBELLUM
AND OCCIPITAL BRAIN TISSUE.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.646
MM-HMM.
HEALTHY, PERFECT TISSUE--

27:27.646 --> 27:29.318
TISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE WET.

27:29.318 --> 27:31.320
SO EVERY TEN MINUTES WHEN
YOU HEAR THAT TIMER DING,

27:31.320 --> 27:32.982
YOU NEED
TO DRENCH THE TISSUE.

27:32.982 --> 27:34.223
OKAY.

27:34.223 --> 27:36.686
OKAY, GOOD. NOW WHEN I
GET CLOSE TO THE TUMOR,

27:36.686 --> 27:37.857
WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS,
I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO--

27:37.857 --> 27:39.288
DRENCH THE TISSUE.
GOT IT.

27:39.288 --> 27:43.092
NO. I'M GOING TO STIMULATE
THE FACIAL NERVE WITH A PROBE.

27:43.092 --> 27:44.293
AND THEN I'M GONNA ASK YOU

27:44.293 --> 27:46.295
TO TELL ME
WHEN JIMMY'S FACE TWITCHES.

27:46.295 --> 27:48.137
AS LONG AS WE SEE A TWITCH,

27:48.137 --> 27:51.941
HIS FACIAL FUNCTION
IS STILL INTACT.

27:51.941 --> 27:54.103
OKAY. DRENCH THE TISSUE.

27:54.103 --> 27:55.805
(instrument clatters)

27:55.805 --> 27:57.106
(liquid drizzles)

27:57.106 --> 27:59.108
(engines whirring)

27:59.108 --> 28:01.751
(jet engines roaring)

28:01.751 --> 28:04.353
WELL, LET'S GO.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

28:04.353 --> 28:07.857
I GOT WORD TO HOLD A MINUTE.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.790
(jet engines roar)

28:10.790 --> 28:13.692
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN DO THIS.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.165
GET OFF.

28:16.165 --> 28:17.326
(exhales)

28:17.326 --> 28:19.929
(seat belt release clicks)

28:19.929 --> 28:21.801
(seat belt clatters)

28:23.773 --> 28:27.706
(jet engines roaring)

28:28.878 --> 28:30.209
ALL RIGHT.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.741
WELL, CALL ME WHEN YOU
GET EYES ON THE LIVER.

28:31.741 --> 28:33.012
YEAH.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.113
(clicks)

28:36.045 --> 28:42.892
(engines whirring)

28:44.794 --> 28:46.425
(speaking indistinctly)

28:46.425 --> 28:49.428
(engines accelerating)

28:50.960 --> 28:52.731
(inhales and exhales deeply)

28:56.335 --> 28:59.338
(men speaking indistinctly)

29:01.841 --> 29:04.844
(engines roaring)

29:16.826 --> 29:18.257
(rotors whirring)

29:18.257 --> 29:19.258
(monitor beeping steadily)
IT LOOKS GOOD SO FAR,
BAILEY.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.790
NOW REMEMBER,
ONCE WE GET IT OUT,

29:20.790 --> 29:22.091
WE'RE ONLY 50 MINUTES OUT.

29:22.091 --> 29:24.233
SO YOU CAN START
PREPPING HER.

29:24.233 --> 29:25.795
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:25.795 --> 29:27.797
DR. ROSS.
I-I, NO.

29:27.797 --> 29:30.069
I CAN'T MAKE THE CUT
THIS TIME.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.801
LET'S STOP
WHILE WE'RE AHEAD.

29:31.801 --> 29:32.872
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE THE CUT.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.203
I WANT YOU TO GET THE BASIN

29:34.203 --> 29:35.544
SO I CAN PUT THE LIVER
IN THE BASIN.

29:35.544 --> 29:37.046
CAN YOU DO THAT?

29:37.046 --> 29:38.777
YES. THAT I CAN DO.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.410
(beeping continues)

29:41.410 --> 29:43.983
(squishing)

29:46.555 --> 29:49.959
UH, DR. GREY...

29:49.959 --> 29:53.062
IS... THAT A MASS?

29:53.062 --> 29:54.924
(beeping continues)

29:54.924 --> 29:55.895
NO.
IT ISN'T?

29:55.895 --> 29:57.466
NO, I MEAN, IT IS.

29:57.466 --> 29:59.798
I--WE HAVE TO
HAVE THAT BIOPSIED.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.071
(sighs)

30:02.071 --> 30:03.873
(clatter)

30:03.873 --> 30:05.935
(indistinct conversations)

30:05.935 --> 30:07.977
(monitor beeping steadily)
(Alana) AND HOW MUCH DOES
THE AFRICA PROGRAM COST?

30:07.977 --> 30:09.138
LESS THAN YOU'D THINK.

30:09.138 --> 30:10.840
ADMIN COSTS
COMES OUT OF AN ENDOWMENT,

30:10.840 --> 30:13.042
AND ALL THE SURGICAL TIME
IS DONATED.

30:13.042 --> 30:15.084
BUT ENDOWMENTS
DON'T TEND TO GROW

30:15.084 --> 30:16.946
WITH THE POPULARITY
OF THESE PROGRAMS,

30:16.946 --> 30:19.849
WHERE, VERY SOON, YOU HAVE
EVERY SICK KID IN AFRICA

30:19.849 --> 30:22.051
BANGING DOWN YOUR DOOR.

30:22.051 --> 30:24.093
(container clatters)

30:24.093 --> 30:25.254
(Cristina) WHAT HAPPENED?

30:25.254 --> 30:27.957
(Alex) YOU NEED ME TO STEP IN?

30:27.957 --> 30:29.198
NO. NO.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.031
(exhales)

30:32.031 --> 30:33.832
(Owen) Robbins?

30:33.832 --> 30:35.134
TRY TO PICTURE THE WAVES.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.465
I'm trying.

30:36.465 --> 30:37.836
(bovie sizzling)

30:37.836 --> 30:39.969
OKAY, REALLY, WHAT IS--
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

30:39.969 --> 30:42.471
Just calm the waves.

30:42.471 --> 30:43.612
THESE ARE
TSUNAMI-FORCE WAVES, OWEN.

30:43.612 --> 30:45.144
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS WOMAN?

30:45.144 --> 30:46.545
I MEAN, IS SHE HAVING
A PANIC ATTACK?

30:46.545 --> 30:48.077
SHOULD SHE EVEN BE
IN THE O.R.?

30:48.077 --> 30:49.448
DON'T YOU
HAVE ANOTHER OPERATION

30:49.448 --> 30:50.619
YOU NEED TO GO SEE?

30:50.619 --> 30:51.951
I MEAN, SHEPHERD'S DOING--

30:51.951 --> 30:53.452
YEAH, AN ACOUSTIC NEUROMA,
BUT THAT'S LATER.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.454
NO, IT'S NOW.
HE STARTED HOURS AGO.

30:55.454 --> 30:56.956
(Alex) LOOK, YOU SHOULD GO.
I'LL TAKE OVER.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.928
(Cristina) ALL RIGHT.
NO ONE IS MOVING.

30:58.928 --> 31:00.960
I'M STRIPPING THE ENDOCARDIUM
FROM THE PAPILLARY MUSCLE.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.361
I SCREW THIS UP, I'LL HAVE TO
REPLACE THE MITRAL VALVE,

31:02.361 --> 31:04.033
SO DON'T MOVE.

31:04.033 --> 31:05.194
I CAN SWITCH OUT--

31:05.194 --> 31:08.497
JUST SHUT UP.
I'M AT THE BEACH.

31:08.497 --> 31:10.139
(sighs)

31:10.139 --> 31:13.973
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

31:13.973 --> 31:16.275
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.277
THEY SHOULD BE BACK BY NOW.
SOMETHING'S WRONG, ISN'T IT?

31:18.277 --> 31:20.049
UH, UM...

31:20.049 --> 31:23.452
THERE WAS A MASS
ON THE LIVER.

31:23.452 --> 31:24.613
WE'RE WAITING FOR PATHOLOGY
TO--

31:24.613 --> 31:26.315
OH, GOD.
A MASS MEANS CANCER.

31:26.315 --> 31:28.457
IT'S CANCER. YOU GOT
TWO DONOR LIVERS IN TWO DAYS.

31:28.457 --> 31:29.618
THERE'S NO CHANCE
WE'RE GETTING ANOTHER ONE.

31:29.618 --> 31:31.120
IF THIS ONE HAS CANCER,
THEN--

31:31.120 --> 31:33.222
OKAY, OKAY, HEIDI, JUST--
IT'S NOT BAD NEWS YET.

31:33.222 --> 31:35.224
OKAY? SO JUST COME ON.

31:35.224 --> 31:37.066
TAKE DEEP BREATHS.

31:37.066 --> 31:38.397
(exhales deeply)
OKAY?

31:38.397 --> 31:40.369
(cell phone rings)
OH.

31:40.369 --> 31:42.201
(beep)
GREY.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.133
OKAY. YEAH.

31:44.133 --> 31:46.635
I'LL SEE YOU IN 50 MINUTES.

31:46.635 --> 31:47.676
(beep)
LIVER'S FINE.

31:47.676 --> 31:49.078
OH, THANK GOD.
(laughs)

31:49.078 --> 31:50.409
OKAY. OH.
THANK YOU.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.041
ALL RIGHT.

31:52.041 --> 31:53.612
OKAY, NOW WE HAVE TO
REMOVE THE TUMOR

37:49.668 --> 37:53.702
HOWEVER, THERE WILL
HAVE TO BE SOME CUTS.

37:53.702 --> 37:55.804

37:55.804 --> 37:58.807
THAT IS GOING TO SEEM
SURPRISING AT FIRST,

37:58.807 --> 38:00.679

FIDUCIARY CONCERNS

38:14.663 --> 38:17.366

38:17.366 --> 38:18.667

38:18.667 --> 38:20.329
IN THE LAST THREE DAYS,

38:20.329 --> 38:21.830
YOUR E.R. WENT FROM BEING
IN SHAMBLES

38:21.830 --> 38:23.372
TO PEAK EFFICIENCY.

38:23.372 --> 38:24.673
WELL, THEN WHY WOULD YOU
PROPOSE CUTTING IT?

38:24.673 --> 38:27.836
THIS ALLOWED ME TO SEE
THAT IN EITHER CASE,

38:27.836 --> 38:29.077
IT'S NOT
BRINGING IN THE MONEY.

38:29.077 --> 38:30.839
IT'S BRINGING IN

38:30.839 --> 38:33.742

ARE NON-EMERGENT,

38:33.742 --> 38:35.344

YOU CAN'T CLOSE THE E.R.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.365

38:56.365 --> 38:57.666

A BETTER IDEA?

39:00.038 --> 39:03.642
THIS WOMAN IS TRYING TO KEEP
THE HOSPITAL FROM CLOSING,

39:03.642 --> 39:06.715
IN--IN WHICH CASE
THERE'D BE NO PATIENTS,

39:06.715 --> 39:08.346
WE'D HAVE NO JOBS,

39:08.346 --> 39:11.720
AND SOME OF US DON'T HAVE
A FEW MILLION TO FALL BACK ON.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.782
