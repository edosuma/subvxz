WEBVTT

00:09.077 --> 00:10.044
Oh, hi, there.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.645
(soft chuckle)

00:11.679 --> 00:13.814
I've been put in a nursing home.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.049
Oh, you didn't know that?

00:15.083 --> 00:16.684
Who is she talking to?

00:16.717 --> 00:17.651
I don't know.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.852
She's losing it.
Yesterday,

00:18.886 --> 00:21.322
she said she won
an Oscar and slept
with Warren Beatty.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.058
I guess you're wondering
how I got here.

00:24.092 --> 00:26.494
Well, it all started
a long, long time ago,

00:26.527 --> 00:29.730
when the Harlem Globetrotters
played their first game

00:29.763 --> 00:34.102
in Hinckley, Illinois,
and after the game,

00:34.135 --> 00:38.239
a very sweet, nice woman
made her way onto the bus

00:38.272 --> 00:40.574
and nine months later,
I was born.

00:40.608 --> 00:41.575
(chuckles)

00:41.609 --> 00:44.345
And 86 years after that...

00:44.378 --> 00:46.247
a social worker came
to check up

00:46.280 --> 00:48.116
on my great-granddaughter Hope.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.451
At first, she seemed
like a nice lady.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.352
I have a cat.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.354
Her name is Muffin.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.223
Oh, my.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.225
But then she stopped worrying
about Hope and started

00:57.258 --> 01:00.094
worrying about
how I was being treated.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.196
That better not be
the last piece of taffy!

01:02.230 --> 01:04.232
Maw Maw, no!
(gasps)

01:04.265 --> 01:07.401
The way that you treat this
poor old woman is reprehensible.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.537
I'm taking Barbara
June somewhere

01:09.570 --> 01:12.240
where she can get the
care that she deserves.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.275
You don't understand.
We have to treat
her like that.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.210
She's crazy!
Who wouldn't be?

01:16.244 --> 01:17.411
You torture her
with hot sauce,

01:17.445 --> 01:20.248
you tie her up in
Saran Wrap and imprison
her in her room!

01:20.281 --> 01:22.116
Hey, it's hard on us, too.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.452
We got to reuse that Saran Wrap.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.155
All our sandwiches taste like
talcum powder and mothballs.

01:27.188 --> 01:32.293
So, she had me taken away
to this state-run nursing home.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.794
And now you're all caught up.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.264
So, if you'll excuse me,
Mr. Wall,

01:36.297 --> 01:41.169
I promised to explain everything
to the water fountain as well.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.172
Whoo!

01:44.205 --> 01:45.439
* Here we go

01:45.473 --> 01:48.709
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:51.179 --> 01:53.181
You have to let
my grandmother out of here.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.749
This place is depressing,
and for some reason,

01:55.783 --> 01:57.751
you have your Thanksgiving
decorations up.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.019
It's gonna confuse her.

01:59.052 --> 02:02.690
Some of our residents don't make
it to their favorite holiday,

02:02.723 --> 02:06.294
so we have Christmas, Easter and
Thanksgiving every three weeks.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.695
Just let me see her.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.164
I'm sorry, but for
her own protection,

02:10.198 --> 02:13.167
the state prohibits you from
seeing Barbara June Thompson.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.335
Oh, yeah?

02:14.368 --> 02:16.204
Well, you can tell the state

02:16.237 --> 02:20.341
that two years ago we earned
enough to pay taxes, so...

02:20.374 --> 02:22.243
they work for us.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.345
Hey, buddy.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.546
Same shirt!

02:25.579 --> 02:28.516
Oh, my God, it's me
from the past.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.351
I knew you'd come.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.852
Listen to me.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.357
When you go on that
business trip to Bangkok,

02:36.390 --> 02:39.427
wear a condom.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.799
He seemed cool.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.401
Hey, just for the record,
when you go crazy,

02:47.435 --> 02:49.803
do you want me to put you
in a place like this,

02:49.837 --> 02:52.573
or do you want to just be
a burden to me and the kids?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.208
No, definitely put me
in a place like this.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.410
And you want me to do
the same for you, right?

02:56.444 --> 02:57.978
Oh! No, I'm not
going crazy.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.248
Oh, no. No one in
my family ever has.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.682
Yeah, you're
gonna go crazy.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.217
BURT: She's right,
Jimmy-- everybody

03:03.251 --> 03:05.253
goes bananas in our family:
there's Maw Maw,

03:05.286 --> 03:07.388
there's Crazy Uncle Mike,
Crazy Uncle Tim.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.423
Didn't you say you had a...
a Crazy Uncle Bobby

03:09.457 --> 03:11.392
who would only travel
via Jet Ski?

03:11.425 --> 03:13.261
Took him six months
to get to Arizona.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.529
Man, this place

03:15.563 --> 03:17.431
is on lockdown.
It'd be easier

03:17.465 --> 03:19.533
getting into Tim Tebow's pants.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.535
Maybe this is the best
thing for Maw Maw.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.237
And we could make
some extra money

03:23.271 --> 03:25.373
by turning her old room
into a bed-and-breakfast.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.408
Hey, we could rent it out
to an old person

03:27.441 --> 03:29.877
who says and does funny things
and acts all kooky,

03:29.910 --> 03:31.712
but this time,
we won't get attached.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.681
We're not turning her room
into anything

03:33.714 --> 03:35.283
because it's still her room.

03:35.316 --> 03:38.319
We need to figure out a way
to sneak her out of here.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.422
Well, Mom, they're gonna know
it was us who took her.
So...

03:41.455 --> 03:42.590
we'll hide her.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.559
Maw Maw deserves to live out
her days in her own home,

03:45.593 --> 03:47.428
surrounded by her loving family,

03:47.461 --> 03:49.563
who is hiding her in the attic.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.599
It certainly worked
for Anne Frank.
See?

03:51.632 --> 03:53.634
Worked for Sabrina's friend,
and it'll work now.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.437
It's time for this family
to sack up.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.939
We're breaking her out
of this hellhole.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.278
SABRINA:
So far we have figured out

04:04.312 --> 04:07.315
which random household item
will represent each one of us.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.282
And I still
don't think

04:08.316 --> 04:10.418
it's funny that you made me
the nutcracker.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.985
BURT:
Oh, it's not what you think.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.921
It has nothing to do with that
creepy vacant stare you do.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.323
We just chose that
because you're always

04:15.356 --> 04:17.591
breaking Jimmy's balls.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.728
(whispers):
There's the stare.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.295
Jimmy!
(gasps)

04:21.329 --> 04:23.331
And there's the crunch.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.333
Okay. Does anybody
actually have a plan?

04:25.366 --> 04:26.500
I do.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.436
I have the perfect plan.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.338
*

04:30.371 --> 04:32.740
BURT:
Sabrina, wearing
the J.Lo Grammy dress,

04:32.773 --> 04:36.944
will use her feminine wiles
to distract the security guard.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.319
Then I'll stroll in,
dressed as the handsome

04:45.353 --> 04:47.421
cable repairman to the stars,

04:47.455 --> 04:49.457
Bulk Masterson.

04:58.399 --> 05:02.736
Once inside, we'll disengage
the security cameras...

05:04.538 --> 05:07.941
...which will allow time
for Virginia and Jimmy

05:07.975 --> 05:09.510
to make their move.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.445
They'll be dressed
as food delivery people

05:11.479 --> 05:13.981
to deliver
75 red velvet cupcakes.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.521
74 of those cupcakes

05:20.554 --> 05:22.556
will contain knockout drops
that I've personally made

05:22.590 --> 05:24.958
from chamomile tea,
antihistamines,

05:24.992 --> 05:27.628
and pharmaceutical grade
horse tranquilizers.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.363
Oh.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.366
Mmm.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.704
The 75th cupcake
is the one Maw Maw will eat.

05:36.737 --> 05:40.408
You'll know it
by the initials M.M.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.577
(sighs)

05:45.846 --> 05:47.748
Ah.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.518
Oh.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.424
Yeah.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.898
If something goes wrong,
Jimmy's cart

06:04.932 --> 06:07.735
will also be loaded with
a tray of pies that will have

06:07.768 --> 06:09.537
guns baked into them.
Whoa!

06:11.204 --> 06:13.741
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:13.774 --> 06:15.709
Whoa. Whoa.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.412
Okay. I guess I just love
Maw Maw more than you.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.847
Who are you kidding?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.749
This is about you
getting to lick the bowl

06:21.782 --> 06:23.717
after I bake 75 cupcakes.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.019
Well, if you're gonna throw the
baby out with the bathwater...

06:26.053 --> 06:27.555
Sometimes I wish
I'd never given you

06:27.588 --> 06:28.889
that phrase-of-the-day calendar.

06:28.922 --> 06:32.426
Measure once, cut twice,
Virginia.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.495
Here's what
we're gonna do: Jimmy,

06:34.528 --> 06:36.430
do you still have all
your stupid magic supplies?

06:36.464 --> 06:38.566
Oh, no, they're not magic.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.900
(whispers):
They're illusions.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.008
They're under my bed.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.483
(grunts, chuckles)

06:55.516 --> 06:57.618
(quietly):
I'm not saying it's
not uncomfortable,

06:57.651 --> 06:59.487
I'm just saying
it's doable.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.489
A bottle of water, a
couple adult diapers...

07:01.522 --> 07:02.990
With enough postage,
we could finally take

07:03.023 --> 07:04.792
that dream vacation to
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.495
But how are we gonna
fit back in the box

07:07.528 --> 07:09.497
after we eat all
that chocolate?

07:09.530 --> 07:10.631
GUARD:
Nope, there is

07:10.664 --> 07:12.500
no Amazing Jimmy on the list.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.502
And I've gotten into
a lot of trouble

07:14.535 --> 07:15.903
lately for letting people in.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.639
We've had a whole string
of robberies.

07:18.672 --> 07:22.510
Well, the truth of it is, is...

07:22.543 --> 07:24.478
I was on the list,

07:24.512 --> 07:26.480
but I made my name disappear.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.619
Whoa.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.654
How'd you do that?

07:33.687 --> 07:34.855
(guard chuckles)

07:34.888 --> 07:36.690
Well, you go right on in, buddy.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.026
They're gonna love you.
(chuckling)

07:39.059 --> 07:41.829
Oh, man. I'm glad
neither one of us
is claustrophobic.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.598
I know. It's bad
enough that there's
not enough air

07:44.632 --> 07:46.934
and the walls are
closing in on me.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.503
Ow.
(breathing deeply)

07:49.537 --> 07:51.539
(panting)

07:52.540 --> 07:55.943
(gasping, groaning)

07:55.976 --> 07:57.978
I got a lot
more sympathy

07:58.011 --> 07:59.279
for those
illegal immigrants.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.280
It was tight
in there.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.551
Now I know why conjoined twins
hate each other.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.718
Is that true?

08:04.752 --> 08:06.654
Has to be.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.522
All right.
Let's go save Maw Maw.

08:11.659 --> 08:12.526
You ready?

08:12.560 --> 08:13.761
Let's do this.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.697
(grunting)

08:16.730 --> 08:18.532
(groaning):
Oh, oh...

08:21.569 --> 08:23.837
(both grunting, groaning)

08:36.183 --> 08:38.886
WOMAN (over P.A. system):
Attention, nursing home staff,

08:38.919 --> 08:41.922
we are about to make
a resident announcement.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.691
(yelling over P.A.):
Attention, residents!

08:43.724 --> 08:47.561
There will be a magic show
in the auxiliary room!

08:47.595 --> 08:49.697
A magic show!

08:49.730 --> 08:50.898
There she is.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.833
Boring.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.334
Boring.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.770
Ooh, that's good. Oh.

08:56.804 --> 08:57.638
(whispering):
Oh, my God...

08:57.671 --> 09:01.274
they blend all their
food into smoothies!

09:01.308 --> 09:03.611
Oh, man.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.579
If people knew this is what
they were in store for,

09:05.613 --> 09:06.714
they'd never bother flossing.

09:06.747 --> 09:07.748
Focus, Burt.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.949
Jimmy knows six magic tricks.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.350
That only leaves us
about ten minutes

09:10.383 --> 09:11.484
to sneak Maw Maw
out of here.

09:11.518 --> 09:14.588
Oh, their bowel movements
must be smooth as butter.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.724
(sighs) Thanks for ruining
butter for me.

09:22.830 --> 09:26.767
I'm gonna need a volunteer
from the audience.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.236
(whispering):
Jimmy. We didn't practice
with a volunteer.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.238
Oh, I've been thinking about it.
I think the reason that

09:31.271 --> 09:33.741
everybody in my family's
losing it is because

09:33.774 --> 09:35.042
we're all doing something wrong.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.645
So I need to find an old
person who's still sharp

09:37.678 --> 09:39.680
so I can ask them
what they did right.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.615
That's a good idea.
Yeah.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.383
How about you, sir?

09:43.416 --> 09:45.052
I bid ten dollars.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.920
Okay, not you.
You... lady.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.257
I love grapes!

09:50.290 --> 09:51.324
Sit down.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.961
Mmm! Oh!

09:53.994 --> 09:56.730
That's the best
lasagna I ever drank.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.299
(whispering):
Oh, he's leaving.
He's leaving.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.236
Maw Maw.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.337
Maw Maw.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.339
Oh!
It's us.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.408
We're here to bust you
out of here.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.811
Oh, great. Ooh.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.946
But my... my mask seems
to be stuck.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.049
(whispering):
Come on. Come on.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.721
Aliens!

10:22.322 --> 10:23.657
It's the aliens!

10:23.691 --> 10:25.859
They've come to make us young.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.829
Take us to the cocoons.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.832
RESIDENTS:
Aliens, aliens, aliens...

10:31.865 --> 10:33.033
Aliens!
Aliens!

10:33.066 --> 10:34.001
Aliens!

10:34.034 --> 10:35.035
Aliens!

10:35.068 --> 10:35.936
Aliens!

10:35.969 --> 10:39.673
RESIDENTS:
Aliens! Aliens!

10:41.842 --> 10:42.743
A-Any more volunteers?

10:44.011 --> 10:47.147
Bingo! I have bingo!

10:47.180 --> 10:48.782
MAN:
Hey, kid, if you're

10:48.816 --> 10:51.852
not gonna do a trick soon,
I'm gonna go chat up

10:51.885 --> 10:54.387
that crazy new broad
they brought in.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.857
Word is she'll
do anything for taffy.

10:56.890 --> 11:01.729
Wait, do you know your name
and where you are?

11:01.762 --> 11:04.331
Henry. And I'm at the worst
magic show ever.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.966
Yeah, he knows
exactly where he is.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.367
May I ask you a question?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.236
See, I've been trying
to find an old person

11:09.269 --> 11:11.739
who hasn't lost their marbles
so I can ask 'em,

11:11.772 --> 11:12.873
"How'd you do it?"

11:12.906 --> 11:15.709
Good genes
and crossword puzzles.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.245
Puzzles and pants, got it.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.247
Any chance you're
ever gonna get that kid

11:20.280 --> 11:21.882
out of the trunk or what?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.817
Oh, God.

11:30.758 --> 11:31.591
How did you do that?

11:31.624 --> 11:34.728
Unlike you, I used
to be a magician.

11:38.799 --> 11:39.933
All right, everyone,

11:39.967 --> 11:42.502
time for some
afternoon roughage.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.772
Those of you who have
trouble getting around,

11:44.805 --> 11:47.440
might want to start towards
the bathroom as you're eating.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.910
Great, this is just
the distraction we need.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.845
Remember what happened the last
time we tried to get Maw Maw

11:51.879 --> 11:53.747
to eat something
other than pickles for lunch?

11:53.781 --> 11:54.782
Go get the trunk.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.384
I want pickles.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.952
These are pickles.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.754
They're Japanese pickles.

12:00.788 --> 12:04.424
(scoffs)
The Japanese.

12:04.457 --> 12:08.896
First they shrank the car,
now they made pickles orange.

12:08.929 --> 12:12.866
I love those clever
little bastards.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.802
I can't believe it.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.404
It was hard to admit, but
people in the nursing home

12:17.437 --> 12:18.939
knew a lot of tricks
for taking care

12:18.972 --> 12:20.407
of old people that we didn't.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.309
And their ways
weren't just easier,

12:22.342 --> 12:23.811
they were a lot cheaper.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.281
Aah!

12:28.315 --> 12:29.817
God!

12:29.850 --> 12:31.785
At home, Maw Maw
liked to bite people

12:31.819 --> 12:33.954
when they tried
to give her her pills.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.824
So, Burt would have to use
a bunch of our hot sauce

12:36.857 --> 12:37.791
to get the job done.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.962
Aah, aah, aah, aah...

12:41.995 --> 12:43.831
Aah, ooh, oh, God.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.800
But the nursing home people
actually made it fun.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.836
And they didn't waste a taco
night's worth of hot sauce.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.003
Oh...

12:50.037 --> 12:51.972
Neck candy.

12:52.005 --> 12:52.505
(laughs)

12:52.539 --> 12:54.174
Mmm.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.876
And when Maw Maw decided
to play

12:55.909 --> 12:57.510
"The Chinese Torture Song..."

13:01.014 --> 13:03.183
(playing "Chopsticks")

13:07.888 --> 13:09.990
Time to wrap this up.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.025
We had our way
of dealing with it.

13:12.059 --> 13:15.829
And in doing so,
we wasted 20-sandwiches-worth

13:15.863 --> 13:17.097
of plastic wrap.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.834
But they figured out a way
to change the station.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.837
(playing a gentle
classical melody)

13:32.579 --> 13:35.048
JOAN: Don't be nervous,
everyone's gonna love you.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.450
(cat meows)

13:37.484 --> 13:40.520
Okay, hello, everyone!

13:40.553 --> 13:42.622
The therapy animals
are all being moved

13:42.655 --> 13:47.027
into the auxiliary room and
guess who just got certified?

13:47.060 --> 13:50.497
Meet Dr. Muffin, Purr-H.D.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.032
(giggles)

13:52.065 --> 13:53.867
And my mother said I'd
never end up with a doctor.

13:53.901 --> 13:54.935
(clicking tongue)
Come on.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.008
Jimmy's bringing
the van around back.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.042
Let's do this.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.043
(sighs)

14:03.076 --> 14:04.177
We can't take her, Burt.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.881
The staff here is so much
better with Maw Maw than I am.

14:07.915 --> 14:11.018
I think I just lost
patience over the years

14:11.051 --> 14:12.886
and started treating her crappy.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.656
I owe it to her
to let her stay.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.660
Well, I know it's hard, but
you're doing the right thing.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.530
We'll come visit her every day.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.564
Or every week.

14:24.597 --> 14:28.101
Unless we're tired or busy.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.937
We'll try, that's
the important thing.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.944
Keep an eye on
your husband, sweetheart.

14:36.977 --> 14:40.080
I'm horny and I don't
play by the rules.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.548
I'm not wearing

14:41.581 --> 14:43.116
any diapers.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.587
Did you hear
what she just said?

14:47.620 --> 14:49.289
I told you we didn't
have to wear diapers.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.624
Yeah, and I'm starting
to feel a little self-conscious.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.036
I'm a crazy old lady

15:03.070 --> 15:04.137
Hey, who are you?

15:04.171 --> 15:05.973
You get out of my house.

15:06.006 --> 15:09.109
I appreciate you
trying to help, really.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.111
But, this isn't going to
make me stop missing Maw Maw.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.713
You really miss her, huh?

15:13.746 --> 15:14.847
She's only been at
the nursing home a week

15:14.881 --> 15:17.284
and they take better care
of her than we ever have.

15:17.317 --> 15:21.955
And this is where our
guests take their meals.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.124
Feel free to dine
with "al fresco."

15:24.157 --> 15:25.258
Unless that means "naked."

15:25.292 --> 15:27.727
I'm not exactly sure,
I just, uh, copied some stuff

15:27.760 --> 15:28.695
out of a fancy motel pamphlet.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.131
Speaking of which,
can I see that indoor toilet

15:31.164 --> 15:32.332
you wrote so much about?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.634
Yeah, right down the hall.

15:34.667 --> 15:35.768
What's going on?
I told you.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.138
I'm turning Maw Maw's room
into a bed and breakfast.

15:38.171 --> 15:41.141
The guy needs a place
to stay for the holidays.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.610
And, apparently, he got most of
the blood I donated last year,

15:43.643 --> 15:45.112
so we're practically related.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.113
What's he paying you with?

15:46.146 --> 15:47.514
This shirt.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.983
Plus, he pinky promised
if he ever finds a bag of money

15:50.017 --> 15:50.917
in the woods, I get half.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.986
You sure he wasn't
crossing his fingers?

15:53.020 --> 15:55.188
He did the first time,
but I made him do it again.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.662
How's the crossword
puzzle going?

16:02.695 --> 16:03.630
Not good.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.498
I mean, it's just so hard.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.001
I don't know how the geniuses
at TV Guide make these things.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.769
Well, I wouldn't
beat yourself up too much.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.538
Your TV only gets two channels.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.206
(ringing)

16:13.240 --> 16:14.274
Hello?

16:14.307 --> 16:17.010
I'm not sure how to say this.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.046
I have some bad news
about your grandmother.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.614
Oh, no.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.183
She's gone, isn't she?

16:23.216 --> 16:25.052
Oh, she's gone all right.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.219
She's gone bat-crap crazy.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.021
(Maw Maw growls)

16:28.055 --> 16:30.157
I thought I'd seen
everything here.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.726
I lived through the great
Senior Syphilis Epidemic of '08,

16:33.760 --> 16:36.029
but I never thought
I'd see a hostage situation.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.065
She took people hostage?

16:38.098 --> 16:40.133
Worse: she's barricaded herself
in the animal therapy lounge.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.035
Ooh.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.670
(cat meows)

16:43.703 --> 16:46.039
How many times do I have
to mark my territory

16:46.073 --> 16:48.041
for you filthy cats?

16:48.075 --> 16:49.042
(meows)

16:49.076 --> 16:51.078
This is my side of the room.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.145
What happened?

16:52.179 --> 16:54.581
She seemed so happy
the last time we were here.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.648
When were you here?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.050
I'll ask the questions.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.818
What got her so upset?

16:58.851 --> 16:59.952
The residents had
just finished their turkey

16:59.986 --> 17:03.190
and stuffing smoothies and then,
it was time for dessert,

17:03.223 --> 17:04.691
and then somebody ate
the last piece of taffy.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.060
What? You never want to take
away this woman's taffy.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.196
Not unless you got
a handful of circus peanuts.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.363
But we didn't know that.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.100
ROGER:
Whoa, whoa, now you've had

17:13.133 --> 17:14.434
enough taffy, Barbara June.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.603
Let's give the last
piece to someone else.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.105
(Roger screams in pain)

17:18.138 --> 17:19.038
(growls)

17:19.072 --> 17:22.175
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
calm down, Barbara June.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.244
(crying):
Why, why?

17:24.277 --> 17:26.213
Why don't we just relax

17:26.246 --> 17:29.082
and watch some fish, hmm?

17:29.116 --> 17:30.049
Aah!

17:33.120 --> 17:35.355
No, don't scare the clown fish.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.189
They're very sensitive.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.258
(gasps, screams)

17:41.161 --> 17:42.195
(laughing)

17:42.229 --> 17:43.430
Candy, candy, candy.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.431
I have candy.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.299
Yum, yum.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.168
That's not candy.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.437
That's generic Thorazine.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.440
(screaming in pain)

17:53.473 --> 17:56.109
And then she barricaded herself
in the animal therapy lounge.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.110
You!

17:57.144 --> 18:00.280
You're the one who
stuck me in this hellhole.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.315
(growls)

18:02.349 --> 18:05.318
Which cat is yours?

18:05.352 --> 18:06.486
None of them.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.121
I would never bring
my cat here; never.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.124
(cats meowing)

18:17.830 --> 18:20.300
(gasping)

18:20.333 --> 18:21.568
Oh, God, please,
don't hurt my Muffin!

18:21.601 --> 18:24.304
How could she hurt your...

18:24.337 --> 18:26.539
My cat, my cat's
name is Muffin.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.781
Anything you want to say
before I disprove the whole

18:34.814 --> 18:36.616
nine lives theory?

18:36.649 --> 18:38.351
Oh, God, you people
need to do something!

18:38.385 --> 18:41.321
Get in there and stop her
before she hurts my Muffin.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.323
I'm really gonna need
you to just say cat.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.192
I don't care what
you do to that woman,

18:45.225 --> 18:47.360
just save my cat.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.629
I'll be honest with you--
a balance beam accident left me

18:49.662 --> 18:53.166
with a tilted uterus, and
Muffin is as close to a child

18:53.200 --> 18:54.201
as I'll ever have.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.635
You heard the lady.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.205
We got the green light, people.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.206
It's go time.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.895
(cats meowing)

19:30.503 --> 19:32.272
(meows)

19:40.280 --> 19:42.215
(meows)

19:42.249 --> 19:43.450
Muffin!

19:44.551 --> 19:47.420
Aah, aah, Mexican no-no sauce.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.655
Aah, aah!

19:48.688 --> 19:49.756
Aah!

19:49.789 --> 19:51.224
Oh, God, aah, aah!

20:04.704 --> 20:07.407
Oh... finally...

20:07.440 --> 20:10.543
somebody who knows
how to control me.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.248
VIRGINIA:
Even that stupid do-gooder

20:15.282 --> 20:16.549
with the dumb-looking cat
had to admit,

20:16.583 --> 20:19.452
everyone would be better off
if Maw Maw went home.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.324
Of course, that did
mean that Natesville's

20:24.357 --> 20:25.792
only one-star bed and breakfast
would have to close down.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.294
Oh!

20:29.296 --> 20:30.897
Awkward.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.403
And since Maw Maw was expecting
a Thanksgiving Dinner

20:36.436 --> 20:37.704
We gave her one

20:37.737 --> 20:38.738
plus we decided to try some
of the tricks we learned

20:38.771 --> 20:40.873
from the folks
at the nursing home.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.241
Maw Maw?

20:47.414 --> 20:49.316
(playing "Chopsticks")

20:49.349 --> 20:51.451
Instead of grabbing
the Saran Wrap, hot sauce

20:51.484 --> 20:54.321
and spray bottle every time Maw
Maw started to annoy us,

20:54.354 --> 20:58.291
we got a little more creative
with our solutions.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.393
(plays classical music)

21:00.427 --> 21:02.562
Things around the house
actually got a little

21:02.595 --> 21:04.297
more peaceful
and on those rare occasions

21:04.331 --> 21:06.766
where we had to bring out
the big guns,

21:06.799 --> 21:09.636
well, sometimes that's
just what family has to do.

21:09.669 --> 21:13.306
Your damn pet monkey
stole the last piece of taffy.

21:13.340 --> 21:16.909
(Maw Maw grunting)

21:16.943 --> 21:18.277
And nothing says family

21:18.311 --> 21:21.481
like squirting your 86-year-old
grandmother in the face so she

21:21.514 --> 21:23.616
won't hit your granddaughter
with a fireplace poker.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.989
Tune in next week for
the exciting conclusion.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.123
(laughs)
Just kidding.

21:31.157 --> 21:34.461
No, you can't stretch this
crap into a three-parter.
