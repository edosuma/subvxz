WEBVTT

00:11.553 --> 00:13.213
Ma'am.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.192
Good morning.

00:19.216 --> 00:21.363
- Good morning.
- How can I help you?

00:21.387 --> 00:23.745
I was interested in leasing
a safe deposit box.

00:23.769 --> 00:26.728
There are some requests in life
that are beyond my power.

00:27.277 --> 00:31.251
Yours happens to be one
for which I am eminently qualified.

00:31.275 --> 00:33.298
"Eminently qualified"? Huh.

00:33.322 --> 00:34.630
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:34.654 --> 00:37.282
It means I'll have to ask you
a few personal questions.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.946
Well, not too personal I hope,
Curtis.

00:45.420 --> 00:49.500
Just name, address,
and telephone number.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.822
It's essential, I promise you.
It's banking regulations these days.

00:55.846 --> 00:57.177
- You know how it is.
- Yeah.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.529
Nobody move.

00:59.553 --> 01:00.757
Get away from the desk.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.488
Behind the counter,
let me see your hands.

01:04.512 --> 01:06.325
The rest of you, on the ground.

01:06.349 --> 01:08.410
- Get on the ground.
- Get down!

01:08.434 --> 01:10.543
- Now.
- You, down!

01:10.567 --> 01:12.895
- Get down now!
- Face down!

01:17.744 --> 01:20.615
Federal agent. Drop your weapons.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.561
Wrong move, lady.

01:36.585 --> 01:39.171
- Johnny. Johnny, no.
- Please don't.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.647
Whoa. Not cool.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.247
Definitely not cool.

02:32.271 --> 02:34.483
You want me to handle this?

02:35.363 --> 02:37.190
Knock yourself out.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.595
It's stuffed. It's a king cobra.

02:46.619 --> 02:49.971
Its venom could kill a grown man
inside of 15 minutes.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.308
I thought these were bigger.

02:51.332 --> 02:54.339
Not so big until he's stretched out
and locked onto your butt.

02:56.509 --> 02:59.463
Looks like Jeffrey Dahmer's
evidence box.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.474
- I think this is Nate's.
- I'm thinking Hetty.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.326
Mine.

03:05.350 --> 03:07.653
- Sorry.
- Mine.

03:07.677 --> 03:10.451
- We thought Hetty was having a sale.
- What is all this stuff?

03:10.475 --> 03:13.198
Just prized possessions,
sacred belongings,

03:13.222 --> 03:14.658
heirlooms and memories.

03:14.682 --> 03:17.209
Irreplaceable items
that cannot be assigned a price.

03:17.233 --> 03:18.899
This is priceless?

03:19.407 --> 03:20.438
Are you kidding?

03:21.076 --> 03:25.239
A full set of 72 ultra jelly bracelets
from Roppongi, Tokyo?

03:25.914 --> 03:26.921
Wow.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.970
G. Has a thing for ultra jelly bracelets
from Roppongi, Tokyo.

03:29.994 --> 03:32.267
Look, there was a break-in
in my apartment building.

03:32.291 --> 03:34.763
And I couldn't
let the crooks take my stuff, so...

03:34.787 --> 03:36.898
What is the price on the black market
these days

03:36.922 --> 03:39.025
for a poppycock baby doll?

03:39.049 --> 03:42.919
It's not just any poppycock baby doll.
This is...

03:43.390 --> 03:44.741
It's Pete.

03:44.765 --> 03:48.953
I keep my mementos
in a GSA Class 6 fireproof safe.

03:48.977 --> 03:52.929
Drilled to the floor of my den
under false wooden panels.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.585
Yeah, you gotta be protected.

03:55.609 --> 03:56.856
For Pete's sake.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.707
Okay, GSA Class 6 is military grade.
What do you keep in there?

04:01.731 --> 04:03.793
It's classified.

04:03.817 --> 04:06.045
- What about you?
- Where do I keep my stuff?

04:06.069 --> 04:07.740
- Yeah.
- Here.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.391
No, I don't mean memories.
I mean... I mean stuff, like this.

04:11.415 --> 04:12.723
G. Doesn't have stuff.

04:12.747 --> 04:14.722
I find pack rats and hoarders
fascinating.

04:14.746 --> 04:16.439
They tend to be closet romantics.

04:16.463 --> 04:19.358
- I'm sorry, did you call me a hoarder?
- He said "pack rat" first.

04:19.382 --> 04:21.103
Wow.

04:21.128 --> 04:27.815
Ah, memories. I still mourn the loss
of my most prized possession.

04:27.839 --> 04:31.113
Traces of it are still embedded
in the asphalt

04:31.137 --> 04:35.440
along a quarter mile stretch at
the Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.079
I don't even think it was
the most expensive thing I ever owned

04:39.103 --> 04:42.196
but it certainly was the fastest.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.254
New case on deck.

04:47.278 --> 04:49.113
Dude, is that a king cobra?

04:51.124 --> 04:54.184
This happened last month
on Mutanabbi Street in Baghdad.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.144
Six Marines wounded, one killed.

04:56.168 --> 04:58.555
- An ambush.
- Followed by a robbery.

04:58.579 --> 05:00.524
Five million dollars in U.S. Currency.

05:00.548 --> 05:03.362
Reconstruction funds
headed for local contractors.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.364
The Jihadist Raiders Front
took credit for it.

05:06.388 --> 05:07.694
I've heard of these guys.

05:07.718 --> 05:11.057
Formed in 1994 by Abu Al Jaleel.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.488
State Department considers
Jihadist Raiders Front

05:13.512 --> 05:16.369
to be one of the more high-profile
terrorist groups.

05:16.393 --> 05:18.700
They got cells
right across the Mideast.

05:18.724 --> 05:20.787
Well, how did they find out
about the shipment?

05:20.811 --> 05:24.414
You need top-secret clearance
to get access to those convoy routes.

05:24.438 --> 05:26.798
Routes were leaked.
After the ambush,

05:26.822 --> 05:29.886
Delta raided a safe house
used by Jihadist Raiders Front.

05:29.910 --> 05:32.131
One of the things they recovered
was a SIM card

05:32.155 --> 05:34.099
with an L.A. Phone number on it.

05:34.123 --> 05:39.060
Belonging to
Staff Sergeant Chad Jeffcoat,

05:39.084 --> 05:41.473
who just happens to be
a military customs inspector

05:41.497 --> 05:43.607
with access to convoy routes.

05:43.631 --> 05:45.604
They called him
three days before the ambush.

05:45.628 --> 05:47.737
- Address?
- Rents a bungalow in Redondo Beach.

05:47.761 --> 05:49.614
Address is on your phone.

05:49.638 --> 05:52.808
His shift starts in an hour.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.451
You really have
a GSA Class 6 safe in your den?

06:01.475 --> 06:03.455
I told you,
I have to keep my valuables safe.

06:03.479 --> 06:04.817
What valuables?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.877
I have a mint condition
Patrick Ewing rookie card.

06:11.901 --> 06:15.057
A football signed by
the 1986 New York Giants,

06:15.081 --> 06:18.179
and the entire run
of the Silver Surfer comic-book series.

06:18.203 --> 06:21.248
Plus a couple of tickets
for the Lakers-Knicks tomorrow night.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.058
- And they're both spoken for.
- What else?

06:24.082 --> 06:26.227
What do you mean, "what else"?
Does there have to be a "what else"?

06:26.251 --> 06:28.277
- That was way too easy.
- Ha, ha, ha.

06:28.301 --> 06:32.030
And because that is
your "I'm hiding something" laugh.

06:32.054 --> 06:35.676
- There is nothing else.
- No, there is definitely something else.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.906
- We're here.
- That can't be it.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.573
- Conversation is over.
- Is this a Navy SEAL thing?

06:40.597 --> 06:42.317
I'll show you a Navy SEAL thing.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.825
I'm waiting.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.506
I have a Michael Jackson glove
from the Bad Tour in '87.

06:55.530 --> 06:59.301
He threw it out in the front row
at the Madison Square Garden show.

06:59.325 --> 07:01.578
One of those white gloves?

07:02.255 --> 07:04.497
- He was the King of Pop.
- Yeah.

07:05.466 --> 07:08.527
- With the sequins.
- The King of Pop.

07:08.551 --> 07:10.842
Why was it just the one glove
and not two?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.566
If you have to ask,
you just don't get it.

07:13.590 --> 07:15.260
Jeffcoat, focus.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.312
How you doing?

07:25.069 --> 07:26.919
- Good morning.
- Chad's a buddy.

07:26.943 --> 07:28.464
We're supposed to pick him up

07:28.488 --> 07:31.384
but he doesn't seem to be around.
Haven't seen him, have you?

07:31.408 --> 07:35.003
- No. Not today, buddy.
- Thanks.

07:35.027 --> 07:36.829
Have a good day.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.538
Hey, G.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.650
Just the one glove?

07:47.674 --> 07:49.253
Don't do it.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.058
Blood.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.476
Blood trail.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.098
No discolouration. That's still fresh.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.168
Spent 9 mm shell.

08:05.192 --> 08:07.458
The shooter must've
used a silencer,

08:07.482 --> 08:09.788
otherwise the neighbours
would've called it in.

08:09.812 --> 08:12.527
Jeffcoat's wounded, he runs.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.376
Second 9 mm shell.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.911
So he takes a second round,
but he's still on his feet.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.831
Runs towards the car.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.658
Trail ends here.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.013
Perp either finished him off
or he got away.

08:27.037 --> 08:28.934
How far can you get
with two rounds in you?

08:28.958 --> 08:30.603
Not far enough.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.841
So where's the body?

08:33.471 --> 08:36.020
I always unlock the car with the remote
as I come out the door.

08:36.044 --> 08:38.216
Trunk or back seat?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.220
Trunk.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.557
I'm going back seat. Less lifting.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.849
Guess Chad is not coming to lunch.

09:57.770 --> 09:59.240
Okay, if you were Jeffcoat,

09:59.264 --> 10:01.786
where would you hide
your most prized possessions?

10:01.810 --> 10:05.186
Depends on what
my most prized possessions are.

10:05.653 --> 10:07.313
No loose floorboards.

10:10.032 --> 10:11.336
No wall safes.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.242
Bedroom is clear.

10:33.639 --> 10:37.304
Here. Dishwasher door is jammed.

10:43.315 --> 10:45.142
False panel?

10:50.948 --> 10:52.526
Wow.

10:56.453 --> 10:58.339
That's one way to launder money.

10:58.363 --> 10:59.677
Ten K brick.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.260
It's a great place to hide stuff.

11:01.284 --> 11:03.676
Unfortunately,
I don't have a dishwasher at my place.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.763
If Jeffcoat suspected
he was in trouble,

11:05.787 --> 11:07.766
he would have taken this and bolted.

11:07.790 --> 11:10.183
Not put on his uniform
and headed in to work.

11:10.207 --> 11:12.898
Could've leaked the route,
got paid, thought he was clear.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.609
Or he crossed the wrong person
along the way.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.344
Yeah, but who? And where?

11:24.398 --> 11:27.577
Two hundred and fifty thousand.
Sequential serial numbers.

11:27.601 --> 11:32.853
That kind of money, a guy could buy
a lot of sequined gloves.

11:35.075 --> 11:36.629
He wore it on stage.

11:36.653 --> 11:39.128
It has sentimental value.
You can't put a price on it.

11:39.152 --> 11:40.551
- Kensi?
- Yeah?

11:40.575 --> 11:44.081
What's your opinion of a man
who owns a Michael Jackson glove?

11:44.668 --> 11:45.699
The King of Pop?

11:46.629 --> 11:48.372
I like this guy already. Who is he?

11:50.090 --> 11:52.297
Heh, heh.
What's the word from the Treasury?

11:53.135 --> 11:55.816
Serial numbers came from
the shipment of reconstruction funds

11:55.840 --> 11:58.314
stolen by the Jihadist Raiders Front
in Baghdad.

11:58.338 --> 11:59.571
The attack was last month.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.984
That's plenty of time
for Jeffcoat's cut to get to him.

12:02.008 --> 12:05.412
Yeah. And one of the keys
you found on Jeffcoat's lawn

12:05.436 --> 12:07.931
was generated by an airstrip
in the north valley

12:08.442 --> 12:09.960
that rents out hangar spaces.

12:09.984 --> 12:12.939
- He own a plane?
- Nope.

12:17.034 --> 12:18.658
Don't lose it.

12:19.536 --> 12:21.494
And don't spend it.

12:39.556 --> 12:41.051
What is this?

12:43.977 --> 12:45.033
The blues.

12:45.057 --> 12:49.309
Yep, may not look like it,
but I got soul.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.039
Cool harmonica, huh?

12:51.063 --> 12:52.266
My harmonica.

12:55.239 --> 12:56.899
Sorry.

12:57.491 --> 13:02.045
It was sitting out on the table
and I thought it was Dom's.

13:02.069 --> 13:04.452
No, it was a gift from my dad.

13:08.502 --> 13:10.495
You don't talk about him much.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.859
We were living on a base
in the middle of nowhere.

13:37.990 --> 13:40.967
And one night, I wanted to go out
with my friends to the movies.

13:40.991 --> 13:42.654
He said no.

13:43.537 --> 13:45.387
He left me at home
to go and have a beer

13:45.411 --> 13:48.261
with some guys in his platoon.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.747
So I snuck out anyway.

13:54.590 --> 13:56.772
Titanic.

13:56.796 --> 13:58.354
The movie.

13:58.378 --> 14:00.817
I loved it. I still do.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.682
And you can make fun of me
all you want. I don't care.

14:04.641 --> 14:06.184
Anyway.

14:06.768 --> 14:09.141
And after that I came home.

14:10.397 --> 14:12.057
He didn't.

14:13.734 --> 14:16.604
MPs found his body on the side
of the highway the next day.

14:18.780 --> 14:21.651
Coroner needed dental records
to identify him.

14:24.578 --> 14:26.452
What about his drinking buddies?

14:27.372 --> 14:28.973
Questioned. Cleared.

14:28.997 --> 14:30.957
Shipped out.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.002
Case was never solved.

14:34.338 --> 14:38.549
I was 15,
so I never got to speak to them.

14:45.390 --> 14:47.015
Well...

14:49.519 --> 14:51.062
He would've been proud of you.

14:59.321 --> 15:01.230
You play this better than I do.

15:02.824 --> 15:05.446
Well, you should see me
play my banjo.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.413
Looks like we missed the party.

16:13.186 --> 16:14.621
Wow.

16:14.645 --> 16:16.687
Via Baghdad.

16:18.567 --> 16:21.936
From the looks of it,
this is the rest of the stolen 5 mil.

16:25.365 --> 16:27.133
Ski masks.

16:27.157 --> 16:29.211
Coveralls.

16:29.235 --> 16:31.379
Never been worn.

16:31.403 --> 16:33.595
Looks like someone is planning
on taking something

16:33.619 --> 16:35.035
that doesn't belong to them.

16:36.001 --> 16:38.408
Whoa. Not gonna ask twice.

16:39.463 --> 16:41.515
Schematics from
the Certified National Bank

16:41.539 --> 16:44.087
in downtown L.A.

16:45.093 --> 16:47.763
Jeffcoat was tied to a bank crew?

16:48.638 --> 16:50.488
Why rob a bank
when you've got a duffle bag

16:50.512 --> 16:52.176
stuffed with millions of dollars?

17:01.610 --> 17:03.483
Salerno, you here?

17:06.448 --> 17:07.776
Federal agents! Stop right there!

17:28.261 --> 17:29.424
G., you okay?

17:32.265 --> 17:33.265
G.

17:38.271 --> 17:40.679
You really got tickets
to the Lakers game tomorrow night?

18:11.578 --> 18:13.630
I wouldn't do that.

18:13.654 --> 18:16.511
- Nope.
- Bad idea.

18:16.535 --> 18:19.389
- The worst.
- He didn't read the sign.

18:19.413 --> 18:20.749
You gotta read the sign.

18:23.799 --> 18:25.648
Okay.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.277
What is it, Eric?

18:27.301 --> 18:29.272
Kensi just called from the hospital.

18:29.296 --> 18:31.653
The hostile that you wounded
in the shootout

18:31.677 --> 18:33.888
just came out of surgery.

18:34.101 --> 18:35.263
Michael Joseph Benelli.

18:35.769 --> 18:38.236
He's an ex-con
who specialises in high-end heists.

18:38.260 --> 18:40.454
- And the money?
- Just spoke with Treasury.

18:40.478 --> 18:44.753
It's the remaining 4.75 million
from the convoy attack in Baghdad.

18:44.777 --> 18:47.732
How does an L.A. Bank crew
wind up with terrorist money?

18:48.198 --> 18:50.630
The guys have skill sets.
They're always for hire.

18:50.654 --> 18:54.384
You think a terrorist group paid
these guys $5 million to rob a bank?

18:54.408 --> 18:56.382
Maybe there was something
they really wanted.

18:56.406 --> 18:58.515
Maybe the money
was a down payment for the job.

18:58.539 --> 19:01.176
There's more. I just reviewed
the security-cam footage

19:01.200 --> 19:02.978
from outside the hangar

19:03.002 --> 19:05.709
and got this
from approximately 48 hours ago.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.397
That's the mailman we saw
outside of Jeffcoat's bungalow.

19:09.421 --> 19:12.144
Facial rec ID'd him
as Damien Salerno.

19:12.168 --> 19:16.107
Prime suspect in 14 bank robberies
over the last 15 years.

19:16.131 --> 19:18.361
Finally caught him
on an unrelated tax charge.

19:18.385 --> 19:20.162
Released from prison in May of '08.

19:20.186 --> 19:23.118
- Wasn't Mike Renko on that case?
- Yeah, he was.

19:23.142 --> 19:26.163
L.A.P.D. Also think he's involved
in at least five murders,

19:26.187 --> 19:27.535
but they can't prove it.

19:27.559 --> 19:29.042
Jeffcoat makes it six.

19:29.066 --> 19:32.251
I guess Salerno decided
his piece of the pie wasn't big enough.

19:32.275 --> 19:34.715
He's what you call
mastermind and muscle

19:34.739 --> 19:37.912
rolled into one felonious package.

19:47.549 --> 19:50.384
- Mr. Benelli?
- Nice.

19:50.969 --> 19:53.317
A nurse who wears black leather.

19:53.341 --> 19:55.506
Looks like I made it to heaven
after all.

19:56.057 --> 19:57.137
I need to talk to you.

19:58.226 --> 20:01.761
- You're not the cop that shot me?
- No. You wouldn't be here if I was.

20:02.647 --> 20:04.581
My kind of girl.

20:04.605 --> 20:06.992
So, what do you think
Salerno's gonna do

20:07.016 --> 20:09.435
when he finds out
he's lost all his money?

20:10.155 --> 20:11.376
Why don't you ask him?

20:11.400 --> 20:13.613
Because you're the only guy
who walked away.

20:15.494 --> 20:17.320
You're talking to a dead man.

20:18.079 --> 20:19.906
Not if you work with us.

20:21.249 --> 20:22.803
It took some digging,
but I figured out

20:22.827 --> 20:25.848
why these guys are targeting
this particular bank.

20:25.872 --> 20:29.438
Okay, since 9/11, the FBI has been
trying to cut off terrorist groups

20:29.462 --> 20:31.233
from their financial assets.

20:31.257 --> 20:34.320
The most recent success
was freezing a series of bank accounts

20:34.344 --> 20:36.196
used by the Jihadist Raiders Front.

20:36.220 --> 20:39.402
- What's the amount?
- Over $50 million.

20:39.426 --> 20:41.201
And guess where those funds
are located?

20:41.225 --> 20:44.206
Certified National Bank,
Downtown L.A. Branch.

20:44.230 --> 20:45.998
The Raiders want their money back.

20:46.022 --> 20:48.325
They hired the best heist team
to get it for them.

20:48.349 --> 20:50.329
But Salerno doesn't come cheap.

20:50.353 --> 20:51.963
He demands an up-front payment.

20:51.987 --> 20:55.168
And so they attack the convoy,
take the cash and ship to Salerno.

20:55.192 --> 20:56.920
Jeffcoat must have been
the middle man.

20:56.944 --> 20:59.632
He had the clearance
to leak the convoy route to the Raiders.

20:59.656 --> 21:01.882
He told them he'd bring Salerno in
to hit the bank.

21:01.906 --> 21:05.224
Yeah, but no bank
keeps $50 million in its vault.

21:05.248 --> 21:06.426
Don't need to.

21:06.450 --> 21:08.098
Banks retain assets electronically.

21:08.122 --> 21:10.763
If you have the right account numbers,
swift codes, passwords,

21:10.787 --> 21:13.230
you can shift money electronically
anywhere, anytime.

21:13.254 --> 21:14.600
Then why pay a heist crew?

21:14.624 --> 21:15.810
Why not hire a hacker?

21:15.834 --> 21:18.195
Because banks
have unique security protocols

21:18.219 --> 21:20.074
for funds frozen by the FBI.

21:20.098 --> 21:24.192
You have to have physical access to
the actual terminal to move the money.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.199
But that's never stopped you before.

21:26.223 --> 21:29.731
Well, most hackers don't have access
to the toys that I do.

21:29.985 --> 21:32.855
I can make us all very wealthy
in about two minutes.

21:36.408 --> 21:40.381
I mean, if you wanted me to.
Not that you would want me to.

21:40.405 --> 21:44.089
Not that I would want to.
I'm just saying, you know?

21:44.113 --> 21:46.616
What exactly are you saying, Eric?

21:46.835 --> 21:48.269
I think this is an inside job.

21:48.293 --> 21:50.253
All right, Eric. Thank you.

21:56.511 --> 21:57.626
What's his name?

21:57.846 --> 22:00.064
- Whose name?
- The guy in the bank.

22:00.088 --> 22:02.530
The man who will wire the money
to this terrorist group

22:02.554 --> 22:05.537
and then tell the cops he was
ordered to do it by the bank robbers.

22:05.561 --> 22:07.413
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:07.437 --> 22:09.491
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

22:09.515 --> 22:12.703
I want the name of the guy in the bank
who's gonna wire the 50 million

22:12.727 --> 22:14.729
to the Jihadist Raiders Front.

22:15.238 --> 22:17.041
The bank robbery was just a front.

22:17.065 --> 22:19.529
An excuse so no one will suspect
the man on the inside.

22:22.245 --> 22:25.412
I'm tired. I need to sleep.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.269
Well, sleep on this:

22:29.293 --> 22:31.263
You're facing a lot of years in prison.

22:31.287 --> 22:33.455
We can cut you a better deal
than Salerno.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.772
- Eric.
- Yeah, Kensi?

22:40.796 --> 22:42.063
You're on speaker.

22:42.087 --> 22:43.843
- I'll take it from here.
- Yes, ma'am.

22:47.604 --> 22:48.991
He's not gonna tell us.

22:49.015 --> 22:50.279
Yeah, it was a long shot.

22:50.303 --> 22:51.868
I was hoping he'd cut a deal.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.537
Will this guy lead us to Salerno?

22:53.561 --> 22:57.044
Well, not willingly. He's terrified
of crossing him and for good reason.

22:57.068 --> 22:59.124
Then maybe
he'll unwillingly take us to him.

22:59.148 --> 23:01.316
Already on it.

23:03.078 --> 23:05.627
Guys, guys.
Message from Mike Renko.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.763
Says he's got someone
who can help us with this.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.033
Meet him at the boatshed.

23:10.251 --> 23:11.746
On our way.

23:22.013 --> 23:23.638
What's the prognosis, Doc?

23:27.602 --> 23:31.327
Well, Benelli's entire value system
is based on the use of violence.

23:31.351 --> 23:33.906
The threat of Salerno finding him
will be too much to bear.

23:33.930 --> 23:36.682
He's gonna run back to his boss,
beg for his life.

23:37.821 --> 23:40.608
Good thing I tagged him
before he woke up from surgery.

23:41.032 --> 23:44.792
GPS and audio taped
under the shoulder bandage.

23:44.816 --> 23:46.619
That was smooth.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.141
Oh, yeah.

23:50.165 --> 23:52.824
Hey, up top. Come on.

23:53.294 --> 23:55.180
I need to get this tail started.

23:55.204 --> 23:58.049
And you need to get out of the office
more often.

24:03.304 --> 24:06.484
The ever-vigilant
Special Agent Mike Renko.

24:06.508 --> 24:08.698
Late night clubbing, rock star?

24:08.722 --> 24:11.241
I was working undercover
with a bunch of tweekers.

24:11.265 --> 24:12.896
Freaking guys never sleep.

24:13.481 --> 24:16.209
- What you got for us?
- Detective Matt Bernhardt.

24:16.233 --> 24:17.788
He's a buddy of mine in L.A.P.D.

24:17.812 --> 24:19.586
He busted Salerno eight years ago.

24:19.610 --> 24:22.080
You have friends in L.A.P.D.
After the thing with the cop?

24:22.104 --> 24:23.692
And a horse?

24:24.742 --> 24:26.378
You didn't tell Hetty about that,
did you?

24:26.402 --> 24:28.712
- How could you do that?
- Wasn't technically illegal.

24:28.736 --> 24:30.573
- But it was disturbing.
- Yeah.

24:31.708 --> 24:33.747
So Bernhardt, he's a good guy?

24:34.794 --> 24:36.846
- Uh... Yeah.
- I heard hesitation.

24:36.870 --> 24:38.671
Sam, did you hear that? Hesitation?

24:38.882 --> 24:40.850
I see it. I hear it.
Hell, I can even smell it.

24:40.874 --> 24:43.517
Bernhardt's been known
to walk outside the lines a little bit.

24:43.541 --> 24:44.976
But he always gets results.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.757
So he's dirty?

24:47.015 --> 24:51.617
When you're a cop, there's a fine line
between being dirty and effective.

24:51.641 --> 24:54.765
We'll pass. This case
is already hot enough as it is.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.197
Okay, first of all,

24:56.221 --> 24:58.831
this guy is your best chance
of getting close to Salerno.

24:58.855 --> 25:02.941
Second of all, he's here already.

25:04.741 --> 25:05.962
Hey.

25:05.986 --> 25:09.385
Detective Matt Bernhardt,
Special Agents Callen and Hanna.

25:09.409 --> 25:10.800
- How you doing?
- Good.

25:10.824 --> 25:14.638
- Good. Hey, man. What's going on?
- How you doing?

25:14.662 --> 25:16.304
- Good. Good.
- Good.

25:16.328 --> 25:17.831
All right.

25:18.504 --> 25:21.232
Why don't you tell these guys
about Salerno, Matt.

25:21.256 --> 25:22.799
All right.

25:25.178 --> 25:26.434
He's getting old.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.902
He's not pulling heists anymore.
He's planning them.

25:28.926 --> 25:31.992
He's sending a crew in
and getting a cut of the score.

25:32.016 --> 25:34.449
- Good to know.
- Now, Salerno's point man

25:34.473 --> 25:38.666
he's usually this psycho, whack job
by the name of Johnny Manning.

25:38.690 --> 25:40.328
Johnny Manning.

25:40.352 --> 25:42.578
Wasn't one of the guys
who showed up at the hangar.

25:42.602 --> 25:45.530
That's lucky for him.
Thanks for the heads up, guys.

25:46.866 --> 25:48.502
Wait, that...? That's it?

25:48.526 --> 25:50.160
You're kidding me.

26:06.469 --> 26:08.212
- Thanks, pal.
- Thanks.

26:16.229 --> 26:17.616
Callen, it's me.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.663
Benelli's back
at the North Valley Air Strip.

26:19.687 --> 26:22.645
- Looks like he's waiting for someone.
- Okay, we're on our way.

26:23.861 --> 26:26.187
Hey, Hetty, can...?

26:28.866 --> 26:31.333
The Mossberg 590.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.003
Matte-black finish,
eight-round capacity.

26:34.027 --> 26:40.634
Not my favourite weapon,
but it's a useful tool in a tight spot.

26:40.658 --> 26:41.868
Yeah.

26:43.423 --> 26:45.462
It's not loaded, is it?

26:47.552 --> 26:48.714
Just checking.

26:50.263 --> 26:53.026
I do prefer it
with the upper Picatinny rail

26:53.050 --> 26:55.549
and the modified
standard heat shield.

26:56.561 --> 27:01.270
But then my tastes are more refined,
no doubt, than reprobate bank robbers.

27:01.941 --> 27:05.452
I'm sorry for asking, Hetty,
but wouldn't the recoil be just...

27:05.476 --> 27:06.934
It's a bitch.

27:08.613 --> 27:11.960
No, no, I'm good. Good.
More of a surveillance guy.

27:11.984 --> 27:15.742
You know,
the headphones, the microphone.

27:16.998 --> 27:20.283
Kensi talked to me
about her dad today.

27:23.296 --> 27:25.430
- Tragic.
- Yeah.

27:25.454 --> 27:27.399
You know, it's still an open case.

27:27.423 --> 27:28.943
She said she still had questions

27:28.967 --> 27:31.804
for some of the guys who were
supposed to be with him that night.

27:33.055 --> 27:35.048
They're out there somewhere.

27:35.433 --> 27:37.236
What happens
when she finds them?

27:37.260 --> 27:40.436
How do you know
she hasn't already?

27:56.996 --> 27:58.003
What do you got, Kensi?

27:58.027 --> 28:00.328
Nothing. He's just waiting.

28:12.345 --> 28:13.352
Hello, Mick.

28:13.376 --> 28:14.585
Salerno, where are you?

28:15.056 --> 28:16.526
Where's my money, Mick?

28:16.550 --> 28:19.345
I did everything I could to keep it safe.
You gotta believe me.

28:20.019 --> 28:22.664
I hear law enforcement got it.

28:22.688 --> 28:25.369
What'd you do, tip them off?
Cut yourself a deal, Mick?

28:25.393 --> 28:26.787
No. Salerno, no.

28:26.811 --> 28:28.752
Kensi, do you see Salerno?

28:28.776 --> 28:31.838
- He's gotta have eyes on Benelli.
- No, I don't have him.

28:31.862 --> 28:33.466
He could be anywhere.

28:33.490 --> 28:34.914
So now it's a sprint, huh?

28:34.938 --> 28:37.003
See who gets taken down first,
me or the bank.

28:37.027 --> 28:39.741
Are you nuts? You're still
going through with the bank?

28:39.956 --> 28:43.265
It's not like I can give them
back their down payment now, can I?

28:43.289 --> 28:47.302
Jihadist Raiders Front is expecting this
job to get done in the next five days.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.054
None of this would've happen
if you hadn't taken down Jeffcoat.

28:50.078 --> 28:52.689
We could have pulled the bank job
and walked away.

28:52.713 --> 28:55.317
Oh, I'm still pulling it.

28:55.341 --> 28:57.505
You want me to show you
how much I need your help?

29:02.728 --> 29:04.887
- Benelli's down. Benelli's down.
- We're moving in.

29:07.149 --> 29:09.272
Shot came from the north.
High ground. North gate.

29:16.075 --> 29:17.794
I can't see him.

29:17.818 --> 29:19.404
I can't see him, Sam.

29:20.830 --> 29:22.004
North gate is clear.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.779
He's not here. He's gone.

29:35.493 --> 29:39.134
All right, everything Salerno had on
Certified National Bank is right here.

29:39.158 --> 29:42.260
It's... Got the game plan,
escape route.

29:42.284 --> 29:45.056
Everything but the date and time
they plan on making their move.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.636
What are the chances
Salerno is gonna get a crew together?

29:47.660 --> 29:48.977
He goes through with this

29:49.001 --> 29:51.640
or he'll be looking over his shoulder
the rest of his life.

29:51.664 --> 29:53.645
We identify the inside man
at the bank,

29:53.669 --> 29:56.775
then the Jihadist Raiders Front
lose the key piece in this whole plan.

29:56.799 --> 29:59.025
Just combed through a list
of the bank's employees.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.446
Ran them through some vectors.

30:00.470 --> 30:02.517
No red flags like criminal records.

30:03.146 --> 30:05.494
Except for one who sticks out.

30:05.518 --> 30:07.540
Meet Curtis Lacross.

30:07.564 --> 30:10.461
Okay, did his college year abroad
in Egypt.

30:10.485 --> 30:14.461
He's active on Jihadist websites
with a radical bent.

30:14.485 --> 30:18.049
And made seven phone calls
to Baghdad in the last month.

30:18.073 --> 30:21.221
All to satellite phones
that are now disconnected.

30:21.245 --> 30:25.008
It's a Raider's tactic. They issue
new phone numbers every 14 days.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.178
Makes them impossible
to track down.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.311
Curtis is also single.

30:29.335 --> 30:33.254
He's got active membership
to four different online dating sites.

30:42.143 --> 30:45.535
Am I the only one who wonders
why there is a suspect in every case

30:45.559 --> 30:47.497
who happens to be a bachelor?

30:47.521 --> 30:51.141
Well, seeing as how criminals tend
to be males with antisocial proclivities.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.827
And also wonders why
that always seems to be the vector

30:53.851 --> 30:55.381
that we go after first.

30:55.405 --> 30:58.776
The lowest hanging fruit
is the easiest to pick, Agent Blye.

31:00.244 --> 31:02.628
Seriously, Curtis is gonna take time
to get close to.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.431
Salerno and his crew
could hit this bank

31:04.455 --> 31:07.517
- at any point in the next five days.
- As despicable as the man is,

31:07.541 --> 31:10.201
Salerno isn't our primary target here.

31:10.421 --> 31:12.497
The Jihadist Raiders Front is.

31:12.715 --> 31:16.214
We need to confirm
who's working inside the bank

31:16.886 --> 31:20.397
and make sure they give up
everyone else involved,

31:20.421 --> 31:22.863
both here and in Baghdad.

31:22.887 --> 31:26.926
And the clock is ticking, Mr. Callen.

31:30.691 --> 31:32.767
You ever thought of getting
a safe deposit box?

31:49.043 --> 31:50.394
Okay.

31:50.418 --> 31:53.018
Time to dial in the Kensi charm.

31:53.042 --> 31:55.977
Yeah, always me with the charm.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.373
Jelly bracelets.

31:58.135 --> 31:59.843
For good luck.

32:00.304 --> 32:02.131
Okay.

32:07.103 --> 32:08.976
Okay, Eric. Kensi's going in.

32:09.772 --> 32:13.188
All right, Sam.
Accessing the bank cameras now.

32:40.845 --> 32:42.636
Hands where I can see them.

32:43.556 --> 32:44.860
You went too far, Johnny.

32:44.884 --> 32:46.362
Say my name again, you're next.

32:46.386 --> 32:48.823
- Roll with it.
- Sam, I'm down.

32:48.847 --> 32:50.218
I'm going in.

32:51.313 --> 32:52.748
Cell phones on the ground in front.

32:52.772 --> 32:53.971
- Let's go!
- Move.

32:55.985 --> 32:58.084
Anybody that works here,
line up behind the counter.

32:58.108 --> 33:00.318
Let's go. Come on, move. Let's go.

33:03.534 --> 33:06.926
We're moving to the back of the bank,
single file line.

33:06.950 --> 33:08.425
Now!

33:08.449 --> 33:10.924
- Eric, I'm going around the back.
- All right.

33:10.948 --> 33:12.892
I'm gonna disable the fire alarm
and lock

33:12.916 --> 33:15.018
so you can get inside
the bank's emergency exit.

33:15.042 --> 33:17.644
If you wanna live, do not look at me,
not at my colleagues.

33:17.668 --> 33:19.643
Do you understand? Let's go now.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.005
Move back, come on.

33:21.677 --> 33:22.792
Two minutes.

33:23.971 --> 33:25.607
Speak to me, Eric.

33:25.631 --> 33:26.837
L.A.P.D. Is on their way.

33:28.267 --> 33:29.927
Move it.

33:30.686 --> 33:32.145
Keep moving.

33:33.856 --> 33:39.195
All right. This is it.
You know what to do. Now.

33:42.990 --> 33:44.247
Come on.

33:44.271 --> 33:48.150
I never got the call.

33:48.370 --> 33:50.054
There's been a change of plans.

33:50.078 --> 33:52.015
The cops are on to us.
Salerno pulled it up.

33:52.039 --> 33:54.449
You want your money,
we gotta do it now.

33:58.297 --> 33:59.756
Him.

34:00.174 --> 34:01.941
Curtis? What is this?

34:01.965 --> 34:03.213
You're about to find out.

34:03.844 --> 34:06.655
My name is Connor Lavery.
I'm the manager of this branch.

34:06.679 --> 34:09.574
I don't want anyone to get hurt.
Just... Please.

34:09.599 --> 34:12.637
- Just tell me what it is you want me...
- Get your hands up.

34:14.188 --> 34:19.063
You're gonna take us to your office
right now, Connor. Let's go.

34:23.364 --> 34:25.155
Approaching back door.

34:26.784 --> 34:28.587
- The door is locked, Eric.
- Hold on.

34:28.610 --> 34:31.431
It looks like the bank upgraded
their security system last month.

34:31.455 --> 34:34.469
I'm gonna need some time to
work around it and breach their server.

34:34.493 --> 34:36.540
As quick as you can.

34:41.172 --> 34:44.898
- What do you want me to do?
- Account 6441865313.

34:44.922 --> 34:47.193
There should be
about $50 million in there.

34:47.217 --> 34:50.447
You will transfer everything
in that account to this bank

34:50.472 --> 34:53.190
- using your pass codes.
- Istanbul.

34:53.214 --> 34:55.943
Do what he says and you might see
your wife and kids again.

34:55.967 --> 34:57.866
Yes, sir. Okay.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.072
Come on, Eric.

34:59.096 --> 35:01.600
Going as fast as I can, Sam.
We're almost there.

35:10.703 --> 35:14.403
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Almost. Almost.

35:17.001 --> 35:18.080
- It's done.
- Yeah?

35:18.627 --> 35:20.952
- We're good. Let's roll.
- I copy.

35:21.714 --> 35:24.121
- Copy that.
- Follow me.

35:31.473 --> 35:33.016
- Come on, Eric.
- Three seconds, Sam.

35:38.230 --> 35:41.231
Get down. Get down.

35:48.532 --> 35:49.532
Go!

36:13.297 --> 36:16.962
Ladies and gentlemen,
Curtis has left the building.

36:22.682 --> 36:24.531
On behalf of the L.A.P.D.,

36:24.555 --> 36:26.860
I'd like to say
it's a pleasure doing business.

36:26.884 --> 36:28.365
- You're good.
- Yeah?

36:28.389 --> 36:31.433
And you have no idea
how much it pains him to admit that.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.700
I'm a man of many flaws.
Taste in friends is not one of them.

36:34.724 --> 36:35.933
Most of the time.

36:36.153 --> 36:37.921
Come on.
It's my idea of a good time.

36:37.945 --> 36:40.663
- He's growing on me.
- Hey, he does a good psycho.

36:40.687 --> 36:42.634
Well, there's worse ways
to make a living.

36:42.658 --> 36:44.238
All right.

36:46.539 --> 36:47.546
Show ain't over yet.

36:47.570 --> 36:51.093
Okay, everybody,
this operation has concluded.

36:51.117 --> 36:54.389
Many thanks to all of you at
the L.A.P.D. For your help with this op.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.224
Remember,
the bank employees do not know

36:56.248 --> 36:58.309
this was an undercover operation.

36:58.333 --> 37:02.044
They've all been transported
back to the precinct for questioning.

37:03.180 --> 37:05.398
Impressive performance.
Not quite Oscar-winning,

37:05.422 --> 37:07.283
but definitely worthy
of a nomination.

37:07.307 --> 37:09.967
Hey, at least I made Curtis
believe it was real.

37:10.438 --> 37:12.406
Next time I'll be the bad guy.

37:12.430 --> 37:15.287
All right. Fine by me.

37:15.311 --> 37:17.892
Got it, Eric. We're on our way.

37:18.112 --> 37:21.172
The GPS tracker you slipped
into Curtis' shirt is up and running.

37:21.196 --> 37:24.259
L.A.P.D. Is gonna question all
the bank employees. Stay with them.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.420
Where do you think
Curtis is gonna lead us now?

37:26.444 --> 37:27.925
- We'll find out.
- Okay.

37:27.949 --> 37:29.664
I guess the jelly bracelets worked.

37:53.356 --> 37:55.147
Looks like he's here
to meet someone.

37:57.693 --> 37:59.578
Tell me you have control
of that wire transfer.

37:59.602 --> 38:01.415
We can't let the Raiders
get that money.

38:01.439 --> 38:03.073
I'm getting close.

38:03.532 --> 38:05.168
Still trying to figure out the subtleties

38:05.192 --> 38:07.632
of the Turkish
electronic-banking system.

38:07.656 --> 38:09.987
Okay, Mr. Subtle. Well, stay on it.

38:34.271 --> 38:37.118
Kensi, have all the bank employees
been released yet?

38:37.142 --> 38:39.830
Half an hour ago.
L.A.P.D. Is not too happy about it.

38:39.854 --> 38:42.708
From what they can tell, none of them
were involved in the heist.

38:42.732 --> 38:44.696
Thanks, Kensi.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.363
It's Lavery. The bank manager.

38:53.457 --> 38:54.975
Wasn't how I thought it'd go down.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.978
You never said anyone was gonna
get killed. They shot that woman.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.222
She was a federal agent.
She left them no choice.

39:00.246 --> 39:02.332
So now we're both accessories
to murder.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.060
That's not the only problem
we've got.

39:05.084 --> 39:06.695
The transfer hit Istanbul.

39:06.719 --> 39:09.650
The problem is
the money's disappeared.

39:09.674 --> 39:11.402
What? How did this happen?

39:11.426 --> 39:14.387
- You tell me.
- You think I stole it?

39:14.812 --> 39:16.911
I'm supposed to be on a plane to Syria
in two hours.

39:16.935 --> 39:18.244
You were in it for the money.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.907
And I was supposed to take my cut
and go back to work Monday.

39:20.931 --> 39:22.485
So where did it go?

39:24.697 --> 39:25.728
It can't be.

39:27.241 --> 39:29.910
I look pretty good too for a guy
who took two shots this morning.

39:30.661 --> 39:32.404
What is this?

39:33.205 --> 39:35.494
The first time today,
it's exactly what it looks like.

39:59.064 --> 40:02.659
CBP has just apprehended
Damien Salerno.

40:02.683 --> 40:06.086
He was caught trying to
get over the border into Mexico.

40:06.110 --> 40:09.008
He's with Renko now, hopefully
telling him everything he knows

40:09.032 --> 40:11.334
about the Jihadist Raiders Front.

40:11.358 --> 40:13.551
Well, that is great news.

40:13.575 --> 40:18.075
You still haven't found
a satisfactory spot for your stuff?

40:18.876 --> 40:21.521
No. I was going to rent
a safe deposit box,

40:21.545 --> 40:26.208
but what happens when I want
my stuff and the banks are closed?

40:28.177 --> 40:31.070
I've done a pretty good job, I think,

40:31.094 --> 40:35.154
of letting go of my attachment
to most physical objects.

40:35.178 --> 40:40.368
But I've never been able to let go
of my antique jewellery collection.

40:40.392 --> 40:42.284
It's in a safe place.

40:42.308 --> 40:44.535
And I could certainly make room
for your things.

40:44.559 --> 40:47.961
Oh, I would never wanna take away
space from your collection.

40:47.985 --> 40:49.590
Oh, well, that would be impossible.

40:49.614 --> 40:56.235
I have an entire warehouse
in Santa Monica devoted to it.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.922
Okay. Heh.

40:58.946 --> 41:00.868
Thank you.

41:03.337 --> 41:07.750
But it's just certain things
you wanna keep within arm's reach.

41:08.759 --> 41:10.443
Well, in that case,

41:10.467 --> 41:13.897
we have extra space
in the Archives Room in back.

41:13.921 --> 41:17.467
Your things would be safe
and close by.

41:19.311 --> 41:22.146
Okay. Thank you very much.

42:11.488 --> 42:14.216
Mr. Callen. Mr. Hanna.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.504
What can I do for you this evening?

42:17.528 --> 42:20.466
- Quarter mile stretch of asphalt.
- Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo.

42:20.490 --> 42:22.300
Not the most expensive thing
you've owned.

42:22.324 --> 42:23.780
But was definitely the fastest.

42:25.085 --> 42:29.379
Gentlemen,
I'm late for a very important meeting.

42:31.758 --> 42:34.332
- Ferrari?
- Aston Martin?

42:37.890 --> 42:40.297
1955 Porsche Spyder.

42:41.768 --> 42:45.600
A work of art.

42:47.691 --> 42:51.274
I just never got used
to the understeer.

42:53.614 --> 42:55.962
So I have this safe at home.

42:55.986 --> 42:58.257
- GSA Class 6.
- Yeah.

42:58.281 --> 43:00.919
That's fireproof
under the fake floorboards in the den.

43:00.943 --> 43:03.588
Yeah, I keep a few things
under lock and key.

43:03.612 --> 43:06.304
Like tickets
to Lakers-Knicks game tonight.

43:06.328 --> 43:07.888
I thought those were spoken for.

43:07.912 --> 43:10.980
I wanted to see how you handled
the Michael Jackson glove situation.

43:11.004 --> 43:13.960
- With the sequins.
- Yeah.

43:14.718 --> 43:18.395
- And?
- And I am cutting you a break again.

43:18.419 --> 43:20.151
I like you cutting me a break.

43:20.175 --> 43:22.994
If you're very nice
then I'll even let you wear the glove.

43:23.018 --> 43:25.592
Gonna take a pass on that one.
