WEBVTT

00:57.474 --> 00:59.392
Walt, you got
to keep that dog quiet.

00:59.476 --> 01:03.479
I don't know what's wrong with him.
Come on, Vincent, cut that out!

01:06.650 --> 01:09.152
Hey. Sorry. Sorry.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.264
- What is it?
- Somebody's in there.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.225
- Everyone in there's dead.
- Sawyer.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.145
Right behind you, jackass.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.651
Jack.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.783
I'm gonna shed
some light on this thing.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.161
Run! Get out of here!

02:43.705 --> 02:45.915
Oh, crud. Now what?

02:59.763 --> 03:01.931
Come on.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.272
They've gone.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.984
What the bloody hell was that?

03:14.111 --> 03:16.112
Boars.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.885
Those boars were looking to feed.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.803
We have to get rid of the bodies.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.306
Bury them.
There's a whole bunch in there.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.642
More than 20. Digging will
be difficult without shovels.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.313
Not bury. We need to burn them.

03:51.815 --> 03:55.067
- They're people.
- I know they're people, Kate.

03:55.152 --> 03:58.195
Burning the remains.
They deserve better than that.

03:58.280 --> 04:02.742
Better than what, being eaten by wild
animals? That's what's gonna happen.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.745
Any bodies we bury are not
gonna stay buried for long.

04:05.829 --> 04:09.707
Look, I know this seems harsh,
but that fuselage in the sun...

04:10.667 --> 04:12.501
It's not about what they deserve.

04:13.462 --> 04:17.589
They're gone, and we're not.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.966
What you say may be true,

04:20.052 --> 04:23.179
but for us to decide how
these people are laid to rest,

04:23.263 --> 04:28.142
it's not right. No regard
for their wishes? Their religions?

04:28.226 --> 04:30.603
We don't have time
to sort out everybody's god.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.314
Last I heard,
we were positively made of time.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.817
I'm not happy about it.
We crashed a thousand miles off course.

04:36.902 --> 04:41.697
They're looking in the wrong place.
It's been four days. No one's come.

04:41.782 --> 04:46.953
Tomorrow morning we need everyone to
start gathering up wood, dried brush.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.122
We'll turn that fuselage into a furnace.

04:50.999 --> 04:55.044
Wait until the sun goes down
tomorrow night before we set the fire.

04:57.589 --> 05:01.217
If he's so eager to burn the bodies,
why are we waiting till sundown?

05:01.927 --> 05:04.095
He's hoping someone will see it.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.698
I'm not the only one
who didn't sleep last night.

05:23.782 --> 05:27.284
There are better things to do
with my time than collect firewood.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.745
You don't agree with Jack.

05:33.959 --> 05:37.044
- What are you making?
- Too soon to talk about.

05:37.129 --> 05:40.172
I'm not sure if it will even work.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.968
Trying to pick up the transmission?
The one on the transceiver.

05:44.052 --> 05:48.139
If the French woman's transmissions have
been playing on a loop for 16 years,

05:48.223 --> 05:51.684
there must be a power source
on the island. A significant one.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.271
- And you can find it?
- Hypothetically, yes.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.816
I'm making an antenna of sorts.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.194
With a few of these mounted
at different points on the island,

06:02.279 --> 06:04.947
I may be able
to triangulate the signal,

06:05.032 --> 06:08.200
- find out where it's coming from.
- So, what can I do to help?

06:11.121 --> 06:14.248
It appears you're as anxious
to get off this island as I am.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.963
Catch the ball.
Catch the ball, Vincent. Good boy.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.841
Good job, Vincent.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.601
Hey, hey, where you going, man?

06:33.685 --> 06:36.812
Nowhere. I just thought
I'd see what Mr. Locke was doing.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.152
Why don't you
help your dad with the wood?

06:43.236 --> 06:46.405
Mr. Locke doesn't want a kid
hanging around him all day.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.032
At least he talks to me.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.868
Come on, Vincent.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.704
- What's your problem? Hand 'em over!
- How about no?

06:53.789 --> 06:55.748
There's other people here.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.292
If one of us wouldn't eat
more than his fair share!

06:58.376 --> 06:59.919
- That's bull.
- Knock it off.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.379
You're not happy unless
you're screwing...

07:02.464 --> 07:03.756
- Peachy.
- Knock it off!

07:03.840 --> 07:06.300
- Stay out of this, metro!
- Hey!

07:08.386 --> 07:09.637
What's going on?

07:09.721 --> 07:13.307
- Jethro's hoarding the peanuts.
- My stash. I found it in there.

07:15.852 --> 07:19.480
- What about the rest of the food?
- There is no rest of the food, dude.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.900
- We kinda... ate it all.
- What?

07:28.198 --> 07:32.451
- Okay, everybody, just calm down.
- We can find food.

07:32.536 --> 07:35.371
There are plenty of things
we can use for sustenance.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.833
And exactly how are we
gonna find this sustenance?

07:42.504 --> 07:43.838
We hunt.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.301
How'd you get
that knife on the plane?

07:49.386 --> 07:51.011
Checked it.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.722
You either have very good aim,

07:53.807 --> 07:56.225
or very bad aim, Mr...

07:56.476 --> 07:59.103
Locke. His name is Locke.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.064
Mr. Locke,
what is it that we're hunting?

08:03.358 --> 08:05.943
We know there are
wild boar on the island.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.195
Razorbacks, by the look of them.

08:08.280 --> 08:13.617
The ones that came into the camp last
night were piglets. 100, 150 pounds.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.203
Which means
that there's a mother nearby.

08:16.288 --> 08:21.417
A 250-pound rat with scimitar-like
tusks and a surly disposition

08:21.501 --> 08:24.920
who would love nothing more
than to eviscerate anything near.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.132
A boar's mode of attack is to
circle and charge from behind,

08:28.216 --> 08:32.135
so it will take three to distract her
for me to flank one of the piglets,

08:32.220 --> 08:35.264
pin it and slit its throat.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.515
And you gave him his knife back?

08:37.601 --> 08:39.684
Well, if you've got a better idea...

08:39.769 --> 08:42.438
Better than three of you wandering
into the magic forest

08:42.522 --> 08:46.150
to bag a hunk o' ham with nothing
but a little bitty hunting knife?

08:46.234 --> 08:50.154
Hell, no.
It's the best idea I ever heard.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.632
Who is this guy?

09:11.468 --> 09:14.803
- Yes?
- Colonel Locke, is this line secure?

09:17.974 --> 09:21.227
- Line secure. GL-12, go ahead.
- Target area is acquired.

09:21.311 --> 09:25.814
Maneuvers are a go for 1300 hours.
Repeat, we are a go.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.693
Roger that. We'll convene at the
usual rendezvous point at 1300 hours.

09:29.778 --> 09:34.240
Locke! I told you I need those
TPS reports done by noon today.

09:34.324 --> 09:38.577
- Not 12:30, not 12: 15. Noon.
- I heard you the first time, Randy.

09:38.662 --> 09:42.248
And no personal calls
during office hours, colonel.

10:00.809 --> 10:04.937
So, hunting boar now, huh?

10:05.021 --> 10:07.606
Who says this is
my first time boar hunting?

10:09.651 --> 10:14.530
Tell me, how come anytime there's a hike
into the heart of darkness, you sign up?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.824
You know what's in there.

10:16.908 --> 10:21.203
Actually, I don't,
and neither do you.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.207
What's your feel on our new friend?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.710
He seems to know what he's doing.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.380
Call me paranoid, but anyone
who packs a suitcase full of knives...

10:31.464 --> 10:34.675
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you're worried about me.

10:34.759 --> 10:38.554
If I didn't know better, I'd say you
have a problem staying in one place.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.268
So, you wanna tell me
why you're really going?

10:49.774 --> 10:54.236
Sayid gave me this so he can triangulate
the distress signal we heard.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.614
- Find the source.
- This isn't about boars?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.117
I'm a vegetarian.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.914
- But why can't I come?
- 'Cause I said so.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.546
Hi. Hi. Excuse me.

11:17.802 --> 11:21.638
Look, I am going off,

11:21.723 --> 11:26.101
away to hunt,

11:26.186 --> 11:28.354
and I was wondering if you...

11:28.438 --> 11:31.899
If you could keep an eye

11:31.983 --> 11:35.069
on my boy. Walt.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.863
And I'm Michael.

11:37.947 --> 11:42.618
Anyway, could you watch him for me

11:42.702 --> 11:45.788
until I come back?

11:51.503 --> 11:53.087
Sorry, I don't understand,

11:53.171 --> 11:55.881
but you're cool with this, right?

11:58.051 --> 12:01.637
- I don't need a babysitter.
- Come on, man, Vincent needs you here.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.973
This will give me a chance to get
to know your friend Mr. Locke.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.232
Yeah. Whatever.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.827
Excuse me. Doctor?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.912
It's Jack.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.124
- Claire, right?
- Yeah.

12:30.208 --> 12:34.920
- How's the...?
- Oh, he's good. Yeah. Thanks.

12:36.214 --> 12:40.592
I thought maybe you should see this.
Someone found it in there.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.095
They're collecting all the belongings.

12:44.013 --> 12:48.559
They're wedding plans
for Steve and Kristen.

12:48.643 --> 12:52.438
They were on the plane sitting
a couple of rows behind me.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.357
I remember because
they looked so happy.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.235
I don't understand
what I'm supposed to do with this.

12:58.319 --> 13:02.865
Oh, well, some of us were wondering
if maybe we should do some kind

13:02.949 --> 13:06.827
of memorial service or something.
You could lead it.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.667
- No, I don't think...
- Well, you know, just a few words,

13:13.751 --> 13:18.130
or even we could just read off names
from passports and driver's...

13:18.214 --> 13:21.049
- Look, it's not my thing.
- Oh, okay.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.847
- Maybe I'll do it.
- Yeah. Sounds fine.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.558
Whatever everybody wants.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.745
That woman is still sitting there.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.081
- Her husband was on the plane.
- Great.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.084
- Are you listening?
- What's a four-letter word

13:56.169 --> 13:58.545
for "I don't care"?

13:58.630 --> 14:02.591
- I think somebody should talk to her.
- I nominate you, Captain America.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.760
You just can't help yourself, can you?

14:04.844 --> 14:08.514
You don't have to worry about
starving with me taking care of you.

14:09.098 --> 14:13.227
- I'm not gonna starve.
- Right. What are you gonna eat?

14:13.311 --> 14:15.187
Ocean's full of fish.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.108
Hate to break it to you.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.654
The ocean is not gonna
take your gold card.

14:23.738 --> 14:27.449
You really don't think
I can catch a fish?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.121
You find something?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.208
The ground here
has been rooted up.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.628
That's how boars get the majority
of their food. They dig.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.757
Afterwards, they generally wallow in
the dirt and rub up against the trees,

14:43.841 --> 14:48.011
- scoring it with their tusks.
- Okay. So, what's all that mean?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.889
It means we're close.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.655
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.618
- Shannon, right?
- Yeah.

15:11.703 --> 15:16.123
- Are you doing anything?
- Me? No, I was just...

15:16.708 --> 15:17.833
What are you doing?

15:19.752 --> 15:22.546
I was just gonna go for a walk.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.007
You want to come?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.467
Yeah. Yes.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.178
Sure.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.684
Can I ask you something?

15:36.394 --> 15:39.021
I wondered when this
was gonna come up.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.691
- I am the bass guitarist in...
- Do you know anything about fishing?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.693
What? Fishing?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.362
My granddad used to take me out.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.240
Taught me everything he knows.
Everything he knew.

15:50.325 --> 15:53.285
He's dead now, God rest his soul.
Yeah, I'm like a...

15:53.369 --> 15:56.872
I'm a fishing fiend. You know,
I mean, England's an island,

15:56.956 --> 16:00.667
so I just throw it in and fish.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.420
Good.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.676
Hey, doc, you got a second?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.971
What's up?

16:13.056 --> 16:15.974
That woman's been sitting
over there by herself.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.935
Maybe she's having trouble
dealing with her husband.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.730
I don't think she's had
anything to eat or drink.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.025
Think maybe you could go talk to her?

16:25.109 --> 16:28.779
Why me? I'm not a psychiatrist.
Maybe you should...

16:28.863 --> 16:31.406
I just thought
you might want to do it.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.909
You're the one that saved her life.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.384
Hi.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.054
Rose, right?

16:59.102 --> 17:01.103
You remember me?

17:02.105 --> 17:04.397
Seat 23A. I was...

17:06.025 --> 17:09.277
...the guy that told you not
to worry about the turbulence.

17:11.239 --> 17:14.407
Everybody's getting pretty
worried about you, Rose.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.536
You want to be alone, fine,
but take care of yourself.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.205
You should really drink.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.586
Okay.

17:27.296 --> 17:31.550
We don't have to talk.
Let's just sit for a while.

17:37.765 --> 17:41.560
How's your son?
How's he handling all this?

17:41.644 --> 17:44.104
A hell of a lot better than I am.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.607
You must be proud.
He's a brave kid.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.360
Yeah. I can't take credit for that.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.989
I wasn't part of his life till his
mother passed away two weeks ago.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.366
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- That's okay.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.202
They were living in Sydney
the past couple of years.

17:59.287 --> 18:02.622
I flew out last week to go get him.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.417
What were you doing in Australia?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.896
Hey, quit giving us the steal signal.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.791
Oh, God. Michael.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.971
Oh, God!

19:43.891 --> 19:46.059
It's bad.

19:47.478 --> 19:51.898
Move. You've got to move, colonel.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.109
Your troops are across enemy lines.

19:54.193 --> 19:59.072
Patience,
a quality which you lack, GL-12,

19:59.156 --> 20:00.991
is the hallmark of a leader.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.993
Hallmark, huh?

20:05.955 --> 20:09.165
Tell me more
about being a leader, Locke.

20:09.959 --> 20:13.211
And while you're at it,
tell me about this colonel thing.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.047
I perused your file
in Human Resources.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.550
You've never been in any
of the armed forces.

20:18.634 --> 20:22.721
I'm just playing a game, Randy.
It's my lunch hour. I can play a game.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.556
Yeah.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.309
Tell me, what's a walkabout?

20:27.810 --> 20:32.647
"Experience the dream journeys
of the fabled Australian outback."

20:32.732 --> 20:35.025
You have no right
taking that off my desk.

20:35.109 --> 20:38.570
So you wander around

20:38.654 --> 20:41.489
hunting and gathering food, right?

20:41.574 --> 20:44.075
- On foot?
- Not that you would understand,

20:44.160 --> 20:47.329
but a walkabout
is a journey of spiritual renewal

20:47.413 --> 20:51.750
where one derives strength from the
Earth and becomes inseparable from it.

20:51.834 --> 20:55.712
I have vacation days. I'm going, Randy.
I already made a reservation.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.089
Wow, John,
you're really doing it, huh?

20:58.174 --> 20:59.925
You tell Helen yet?

21:00.009 --> 21:03.678
Helen? What's this, Locke?

21:03.763 --> 21:06.765
- You've got a woman in your life.
- None of your business.

21:06.849 --> 21:10.852
What is it with you, Locke?
Why do you torture yourself?

21:10.937 --> 21:13.772
I mean, imagining you're some hunter?

21:13.856 --> 21:18.193
And walkabouts? Wake up.
You can't do any of that.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.528
Norman Croucher.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.741
- What? Norman what?
- Norman Croucher. Norman Croucher.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.243
Double amputee, no legs.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.537
He climbed to the
top of Mount Everest.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.958
Why? It was his destiny.

21:33.042 --> 21:37.087
That's what you think you got,
old man? Destiny?

21:39.966 --> 21:42.258
Just...

21:42.343 --> 21:45.804
- ...don't tell me what I can't do.
- John.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.056
He's hurt.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.850
John? Can you hear me?

21:51.602 --> 21:54.354
Locke! John, you okay?

22:00.403 --> 22:02.195
Locke?

22:02.279 --> 22:06.741
I'm fine. I'm fine, Helen. I just got
the wind knocked out of me is all.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.369
- Helen?
- God!

22:09.453 --> 22:11.371
- What?
- You called me Helen.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.249
Did I?

22:18.045 --> 22:21.548
- Which way'd that boar go?
- Michael's hurt.

22:21.632 --> 22:25.051
- We have to get him back to camp.
- Yeah, you take him back to camp.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.721
I'm gonna get that boar.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.848
What are you talking about?

22:30.933 --> 22:33.393
I'm fine. I can do this.

22:34.562 --> 22:35.854
John, you can't.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.190
Don't tell me what I can't do.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.033
- Get it?
- Dude, quit asking me that.

22:48.117 --> 22:51.286
Sorry. It's just you said
you knew how to fish.

22:51.370 --> 22:56.332
Yeah, off the Santa Monica Pier with my
old man and a fishing pole and bait.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.711
Never had to try to poke one
with a sharp stick.

23:01.589 --> 23:05.383
Well, really appreciate
you helping me out. Thanks.

23:05.468 --> 23:09.471
Hey, anything that keeps me
far away from that fuselage.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.973
And that freakin' redneck jerk.

23:14.351 --> 23:17.771
Damn it! Crap! Crap!
Son of a...

23:17.855 --> 23:19.481
You want me to have a go?

23:21.192 --> 23:23.902
- Knock yourself out.
- All right.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.407
Okay, here comes one.

23:29.492 --> 23:32.535
Put your weight into it.
Easy. Wait for it.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.871
Wait. Now!

23:38.375 --> 23:40.126
Dude, you got to try to pin it.

23:40.211 --> 23:43.838
Did you see how close I was?
No, you said not to corner it.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.508
Dude.

23:51.889 --> 23:52.889
Yeah.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.939
Excuse me.

24:01.023 --> 24:04.442
- Your name's Sayid, right?
- Yes.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.528
I found this.
It's got your name on it.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.992
I thought I'd lost this.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.662
- Thank you.
- Sure.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.653
His fingers swell.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.281
Sorry?

24:52.074 --> 24:54.826
Bernard. My husband.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.996
His hands swell up whenever we fly.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.374
The altitude.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.377
He started having me
hold on to his wedding ring

25:04.461 --> 25:07.172
whenever we took a plane trip.

25:07.256 --> 25:11.885
I always wore it around my neck
for safe keeping, just until we landed.

25:17.683 --> 25:21.227
You know, doctor, you don't
have to keep your promise.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.857
- Promise?
- The one you made me on the plane,

25:25.941 --> 25:30.528
to keep me company until my husband
got back from the restroom?

25:30.613 --> 25:33.114
I'm letting you off the hook.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.870
Well, you're not gonna
get rid of me that easily.

25:41.415 --> 25:44.334
Rose, you shouldn't be out here alone.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.836
You're suffering
from posttraumatic shock.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.172
Aren't we all?

25:52.468 --> 25:54.802
Yeah, I guess we are.

25:57.306 --> 26:00.016
You have a nice way about you.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.686
A good soul.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.648
Patient, caring.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.859
I suppose that's why
you became a doctor.

26:09.944 --> 26:11.903
Thanks, but...

26:12.947 --> 26:16.532
...I was just kinda born into it.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.826
Family business.

26:31.298 --> 26:34.008
I have never felt so alive.

26:34.718 --> 26:38.346
Getting to finally
tell Randy off was...

26:40.849 --> 26:43.184
...life-changing. I mean it.

26:43.269 --> 26:47.981
Now I'm free to do all those things
I ever wanted to do,

26:48.065 --> 26:51.359
things that I know
I was destined to do,

26:51.443 --> 26:52.944
like we talked about, Helen.

26:53.028 --> 26:56.656
It's wonderful, John.
I'm happy for you. Really.

26:56.740 --> 27:01.661
I haven't even told you the best part.
Do you remember the

27:01.745 --> 27:04.455
authentic aboriginal walkabout?

27:04.540 --> 27:07.208
Sure. That's all you've
talked about for weeks.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.878
Yeah, well, I'm gonna do it.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.756
I'm flying to Australia
at the end of the week.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.466
And I've...

27:17.094 --> 27:19.971
I bought two tickets.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.894
- Helen?
- John, we've talked about this.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.438
- I like you.
- Yeah. I know.

27:28.522 --> 27:30.773
I've enjoyed talking these past months.

27:30.858 --> 27:34.652
- Eight months.
- I'm not allowed to meet customers.

27:35.571 --> 27:39.365
A customer? Is...?

27:39.450 --> 27:41.534
Is that what I am to you?

27:41.618 --> 27:45.830
This isn't really normal.
I mean, it isn't what I do.

27:45.914 --> 27:49.500
Maybe you should find a,
I don't know, therapist.

27:49.585 --> 27:53.296
- I have a therapist.
- John...

27:53.380 --> 27:57.550
I thought you understood, Helen.
You know me better than anyone.

27:57.634 --> 28:00.636
If we talk longer, I'm gonna
charge you for another hour.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.430
That's another $89.95.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.807
I don't care about the money! I just...

28:04.892 --> 28:06.684
I'm sorry, John. I got to go.

28:06.769 --> 28:10.271
Helen, Helen. Helen! Helen!

28:21.825 --> 28:24.077
- Hey. Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

28:24.161 --> 28:26.162
Just rest here for a minute.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.957
I thought the guy with the gimpy leg
should be deciding when we rest.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.544
Hey, what are you doing?

28:33.629 --> 28:36.005
Trying to boost the transceiver signal.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.884
I'm gonna climb this tree

28:40.469 --> 28:43.096
and attach an antenna.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.390
- You're gonna climb that?
- Yeah.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.811
Don't worry. Climbed a lot worse.

30:27.701 --> 30:30.828
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.580
These were...

30:33.665 --> 30:37.084
I found these
the other day when I was...

30:39.171 --> 30:43.633
- Hell, just take it.
- Thank you.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.021
What is that?

31:00.609 --> 31:02.944
Oh, I get it.
It's like toothpaste.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.993
- Doing so good.
- Thanks.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.621
Dad!

31:17.209 --> 31:20.294
- So, like, what happened out there?
- Dad!

31:20.379 --> 31:22.004
Hey!

31:22.089 --> 31:26.175
- Your leg's messed up. Does it hurt?
- It's okay. Not as bad as it looks.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.304
The mighty huntress returns.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.682
- What's for dinner, honey?
- Not now.

31:35.811 --> 31:38.396
- So it was like a boar fight?
- Not so much a fight.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.983
It was more, you know,
like me getting gorged.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.485
So where's Mr. Locke?

31:52.869 --> 31:56.247
I don't think that hunt went well.
That bald guy never came back.

31:56.331 --> 31:59.584
- They didn't bring back any food?
- Did you hear what I said?

31:59.668 --> 32:01.085
Somebody might have died.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.296
We'll die if somebody
doesn't do something.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.922
There you are.

32:05.007 --> 32:08.301
As promised, you and I will be
dining on fresh catch of the day.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.595
- My fish!
- Hope you don't mind alfresco.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.973
It was no problem.
That one gave me a hell of a tussle,

32:14.057 --> 32:16.601
but you have to get inside
the mind of the fish.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.644
- I don't believe you.
- I cornered it.

32:18.729 --> 32:21.981
What's the matter? Can't stand
to see me fending for myself?

32:22.065 --> 32:25.318
- I am so sorry.
- What are you apologizing for?

32:25.402 --> 32:27.612
- For using this poor guy.
- Oh, whatever.

32:27.696 --> 32:33.242
In your twisted brain, you think this
proves you can take care of yourself.

32:33.327 --> 32:36.746
- I told you I'd catch a fish, didn't I?
- That's low, even for you.

32:36.830 --> 32:39.832
Go rescue a baby bird or something.

32:46.715 --> 32:50.468
Rose, after the sun goes down,

32:50.552 --> 32:53.179
we're gonna burn the fuselage.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.474
It's just something
that we have to do.

32:56.558 --> 33:00.978
There's gonna be a memorial service
back at the camp for those...

33:01.063 --> 33:04.732
For those who didn't make it,
for everyone to say goodbye.

33:06.735 --> 33:10.946
- I'd like to be there for that.
- Okay.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.581
Maybe if you wanted
to say something,

33:20.666 --> 33:24.502
- you know, about your husband.
- What?

33:24.586 --> 33:27.338
I'm saying, if you wanted
to say goodbye to Bernard.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.424
Doctor, my husband is not dead.

33:33.387 --> 33:38.224
Rose, he was in the tail
section of the plane.

33:38.308 --> 33:43.145
It broke off in mid-flight. Everyone who
was in the rear of the plane is gone.

33:44.272 --> 33:48.275
They're probably thinking
the same thing about us.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.878
Doctor?

34:08.295 --> 34:10.339
You coming?

34:26.982 --> 34:29.358
I'm sorry.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.944
Guess I should have
gotten the warranty.

34:35.157 --> 34:37.158
I suppose I'll just try again.

34:38.159 --> 34:42.538
Of course, I have no welding iron,
no rivets, scorched wiring,

34:42.621 --> 34:45.498
and it seems I must continue to lie
to anyone who asks me

34:45.583 --> 34:47.585
what I'm actually doing!

34:47.668 --> 34:49.170
Sayid.

34:56.636 --> 35:05.060
We'll try it again.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.356
Kate!

35:11.359 --> 35:13.360
Excuse me.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.697
Hey.

35:17.407 --> 35:19.533
You okay?

35:20.076 --> 35:22.244
Is this when you say "I told you so"?

35:23.538 --> 35:26.540
No. I'm not big on rubbing it in.

35:34.216 --> 35:36.133
Locke...

35:36.968 --> 35:39.053
Locke's gone.

35:39.304 --> 35:43.224
That thing,
it was moving in his direction.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.644
There wasn't time.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.737
What's going on?

35:57.823 --> 35:59.740
Fuselage is ready to go.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.992
Some of the others decided...

36:02.077 --> 36:05.037
I guess there's gonna be
some words said over the fire.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.122
- That's good.
- Names read, I think.

36:09.209 --> 36:12.336
I don't think they're ready
to hear about some things...

36:14.256 --> 36:19.009
Jack?

36:33.775 --> 36:35.651
Locke.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.212
Judith Martha Wexler

36:55.297 --> 36:58.632
from Denton, Texas.

37:00.760 --> 37:04.513
Guess she was gonna
catch a connecting flight.

37:08.143 --> 37:11.520
She wore corrective lenses,

37:11.605 --> 37:14.440
and she was an organ donor.

37:16.109 --> 37:18.652
Or at least would have been.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.280
Steve and Kristen.

37:21.364 --> 37:24.825
I don't know their last name,

37:26.161 --> 37:29.830
but they were really in love
and were gonna be married.

37:31.499 --> 37:35.502
At least wherever they are now,
they're not alone.

37:50.101 --> 37:55.439
A video store receipt lists
overdue charges for Willy Wonka

37:55.523 --> 37:58.359
and The Little Princess.

37:59.194 --> 38:03.614
Looks like he hadn't traveled much,

38:03.698 --> 38:06.742
as far as I can tell from his passport.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.620
You seen Jack?

38:32.894 --> 38:34.895
Nice work.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.023
What?

38:38.733 --> 38:41.443
The boar. Nice work, you know.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.445
Killing it.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.198
Just thought I should say something.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.953
So, that thing... The...

38:51.913 --> 38:56.166
...monster, whatever, she said
it was headed right towards you.

38:56.251 --> 39:00.295
Did you see anything?
Get any kind of look at it?

39:02.132 --> 39:04.133
No.

39:13.810 --> 39:17.771
The walkabouts we arrange here are
not just some stroll through the park.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.984
It's trekking across stretches of
desert, rafting treacherous waters...

39:22.068 --> 39:24.236
You've got no idea
who you're talking to.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.864
I'm well aware
of what's involved, believe me.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.158
I probably know more than you.

39:29.242 --> 39:32.411
It's a trying ordeal for someone
in peak physical condition.

39:32.495 --> 39:35.372
I booked this tour a month ago.
You've got my money.

39:35.457 --> 39:38.375
- I demand a place.
- You misrepresented yourself.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.252
- I never lied.
- By omission.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.880
You neglected
to tell us about your condition.

39:42.964 --> 39:46.425
My condition is not an issue.
I've lived with it for four years.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.385
Never kept me from doing anything.

39:48.470 --> 39:51.555
Unfortunately, it is an issue
for our insurance company.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.891
I can't keep the bus waiting.
It isn't fair...

39:53.975 --> 39:56.310
Don't talk to me about fair!

39:58.646 --> 40:02.107
I'll get you on a plane to Sydney
on our dime. It's the best I can do.

40:02.192 --> 40:04.151
No, I don't want to go back to Sydney.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.862
Look, I've been preparing
for this for years.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.323
Just put me on the bus right now.
I can do this!

40:09.657 --> 40:12.242
No, you can't.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.370
Hey, hey, don't you
walk away from me.

40:15.455 --> 40:19.833
You don't know who you're dealing with!
Don't ever tell me what I can't do!

40:19.918 --> 40:23.754
This is destiny. This is destiny.
This is my destiny.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.341
Listen, I'm supposed
to do this, damn it!

40:27.425 --> 40:32.012
Don't tell me what I can't do!
Don't tell me what I can't...

41:16.474 --> 41:19.560
Help me! Help!

41:29.445 --> 41:31.905
You! Come on!
Come over here!

41:31.990 --> 41:34.283
Get over here! Give me a hand!
