00:03.336 --> 00:04.605
Previously on <i>Total</i>

00:04.605 --> 00:05.338
Divas...

00:05.338 --> 00:06.471
I really want this to be very

00:06.471 --> 00:07.641
much a bonding trip for all of

00:07.641 --> 00:08.474
us girls.

00:08.474 --> 00:10.644
So in each goodie bag, I put a

00:10.644 --> 00:12.579
journal.

00:12.579 --> 00:13.580
What's happening?

00:13.580 --> 00:14.280
You are not in my

00:14.280 --> 00:14.948
room.

00:14.948 --> 00:15.749
This is our room.

00:15.749 --> 00:16.617
I don't care, I'll

00:16.617 --> 00:17.283
punch you straight in the

00:17.283 --> 00:17.951
face.

00:17.951 --> 00:18.785
Punch me in the,

00:18.785 --> 00:19.485
straight in the face.

00:19.485 --> 00:20.353
This is why I never

00:20.353 --> 00:21.588
liked you, Lana.

00:21.588 --> 00:22.689
I will not back down.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.590
I've been trying my

00:23.590 --> 00:24.390
hardest to be nice to you,

00:24.390 --> 00:25.058
I really have.

00:25.058 --> 00:25.859
What are you gonna do about it,

00:25.859 --> 00:26.527
bitch?

00:26.527 --> 00:27.393
'Cause I'm not gonna be

00:27.393 --> 00:28.061
a doormat.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.062
You just get to a

00:29.062 --> 00:30.831
point where you boil up and then

00:30.831 --> 00:31.665
you explode.

00:31.665 --> 00:32.465
I've always

00:32.465 --> 00:33.133
hated you, Lana.

00:33.133 --> 00:33.967
That's exactly why I

00:33.967 --> 00:34.935
don't like you.

00:34.935 --> 00:35.936
I just want us to

00:35.936 --> 00:37.904
have a little getaway place.

00:37.904 --> 00:40.607
A getaway place for you.

00:40.607 --> 00:41.842
Ain't no getaway for me in

00:41.842 --> 00:42.609
Atlanta.

00:42.609 --> 00:43.810
He thinks I'm trying

00:43.810 --> 00:47.013
to leave or run, so now, like, I

00:47.013 --> 00:48.314
don't know what to do.

00:48.314 --> 00:49.082
We have no outlet.

00:49.082 --> 00:49.750
I got to go.

00:49.750 --> 00:50.751
I have to go.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.686
I got to go.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.187
Tonight on <i>Total</i>

00:54.187 --> 00:54.855
Divas...

00:57.858 --> 00:58.725
I'd be interested to

00:58.725 --> 01:00.300
know what your guys' biggest

01:00.300 --> 01:01.535
fears are.

01:01.535 --> 01:02.235
Heights.

01:02.235 --> 01:03.069
I'm not going parasailing.

01:03.069 --> 01:03.804
You already said no.

01:04.470 --> 01:05.138
Commitment.

01:05.138 --> 01:05.972
You need to write a

01:05.972 --> 01:07.240
poem.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.241
Failing.

01:08.241 --> 01:09.042
I'm getting an

01:09.042 --> 01:10.343
apartment with or without your

01:10.343 --> 01:11.177
consent.

01:11.177 --> 01:13.246
That's my fear, you know, me and

01:13.246 --> 01:14.347
Jon getting a divorce.

01:14.347 --> 01:15.916
I was so terrified.

01:15.916 --> 01:17.050
You don't have control of where

01:17.050 --> 01:17.718
you are.

01:17.718 --> 01:19.485
I've realized sometimes

01:19.485 --> 01:21.354
an apology will never heal the

01:21.354 --> 01:24.457
damage that has been done.

01:24.457 --> 01:25.559
♪ Ain't gonna stop

01:25.559 --> 01:29.329
me now. ♪

01:29.329 --> 01:30.597
♪ All the time you

01:30.597 --> 01:31.264
spend

01:31.264 --> 01:32.866
♪ You can't take me everywhere

01:32.866 --> 01:34.935

01:35.936 --> 01:39.272
We make a mark... ♪

01:39.272 --> 01:39.940
Trin?

01:39.940 --> 01:40.607
Yeah?

01:40.607 --> 01:41.341
Where you at?

01:41.341 --> 01:42.075
Jayla's room.

01:42.075 --> 01:42.943
Dang, you sound like my

01:42.943 --> 01:44.144
mama, talking like that.

01:44.144 --> 01:45.011
Yeah?

01:45.011 --> 01:46.012
Whoa, it look clean up

01:46.012 --> 01:46.813
in here, huh?

01:46.813 --> 01:48.615
Need some help?

01:48.615 --> 01:50.684
Sure.

01:52.686 --> 01:53.787
This thing.

01:53.787 --> 01:56.823
Can we talk?

01:59.325 --> 02:00.567
We brought it up before, I

02:00.567 --> 02:01.535
brought it up before, we talked

02:01.535 --> 02:02.669
about it before, but I feel like

02:02.669 --> 02:03.704
we didn't really get anywhere,

02:03.704 --> 02:07.040
about living in Atlanta.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.309
Our residence is in

02:09.309 --> 02:10.676
Pensacola, Florida, in this

02:10.676 --> 02:11.512
house‐‐ you see this house?

02:11.512 --> 02:12.412
This ain't in‐this ain't in

02:12.412 --> 02:13.246
Atlanta.

02:13.246 --> 02:14.548
You live here.

02:14.548 --> 02:15.215
I know.

02:15.215 --> 02:15.882
All right.

02:15.882 --> 02:16.683
And that's part of

02:16.683 --> 02:17.416
the problem.

02:17.416 --> 02:18.417
You don't want to move to

02:18.417 --> 02:19.819
Atlanta, which, I'm okay with

02:19.819 --> 02:21.087
that, but there has to be a

02:21.087 --> 02:22.488
middle ground.

02:22.488 --> 02:23.790
There's a big group of people

02:23.790 --> 02:25.325
who I spent and shared my life

02:25.325 --> 02:26.259
with before I met you, and

02:26.259 --> 02:26.993
before we moved here, and you

02:26.993 --> 02:27.661
know that.

02:27.661 --> 02:28.494
And then, we came here, and...

02:28.494 --> 02:29.429
Yeah, but you know you

02:29.429 --> 02:30.496
said "I do," man.

02:30.496 --> 02:31.665
When we got married, it's‐it's

02:31.665 --> 02:32.766
me and you.

02:33.433 --> 02:34.267
I know, babe.

02:34.267 --> 02:35.268
I'm supposed to take you

02:35.268 --> 02:36.937
away from that, from your nest.

02:36.937 --> 02:40.841
I'm just trying to be a good dad

02:40.841 --> 02:41.842
and a good father.

02:41.842 --> 02:42.676
I'm not trying to

02:42.676 --> 02:43.443
make you feel bad about doing

02:43.443 --> 02:44.110
that.

02:44.110 --> 02:45.111
That's what makes you a great

02:45.111 --> 02:46.012
parent, that's what makes you a

02:46.012 --> 02:47.413
great dad, and the kids should

02:47.413 --> 02:49.816
come first.

02:49.816 --> 02:51.785
And they have came first, this

02:51.785 --> 02:53.620
whole time.

02:53.620 --> 02:55.155
And I'm not asking you to change

02:55.155 --> 02:56.322
anything, I just want you to be

02:56.322 --> 02:59.359
okay with me being gone and

02:59.359 --> 03:02.402
visiting more.

03:02.402 --> 03:04.871
So what I am asking: maybe once

03:04.871 --> 03:07.440
a month, allow me to go to

03:07.440 --> 03:09.710
Atlanta, spend time with Uncle

03:09.710 --> 03:11.778
Buck, 'cause I feel like I'm not

03:11.778 --> 03:14.280
living my life here.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.749
Atlanta's great.

03:15.749 --> 03:17.050
I have aunts and uncles in

03:17.050 --> 03:18.785
Atlanta, Jon's brother just

03:18.785 --> 03:19.853
moved to Atlanta.

03:19.853 --> 03:21.321
It would just be convenient to

03:21.321 --> 03:23.389
have some property there.

03:23.389 --> 03:25.325
This is your life, this is your

03:25.325 --> 03:26.793
world, this is your family,

03:26.793 --> 03:27.761
these are your friends.

03:27.761 --> 03:28.562
Stop saying "your

03:28.562 --> 03:29.229
family."

03:29.229 --> 03:30.063
You over here talking about

03:30.063 --> 03:31.297
"yours and yours and yours."

03:31.297 --> 03:32.298
You chill.

03:32.298 --> 03:33.466
My hope is that we

03:33.466 --> 03:35.836
could balance both living in

03:35.836 --> 03:39.005
Atlanta and Pensacola somehow.

03:39.005 --> 03:39.740
We didn't move here for me,

03:39.740 --> 03:40.406
honey.

03:40.406 --> 03:41.174
Didn't you pick this

03:41.174 --> 03:41.842
house?

03:41.842 --> 03:42.676
Didn't you pick them floors?

03:42.676 --> 03:44.044
Didn't you pick them, all that,

03:44.044 --> 03:45.345
them big‐ass drapes up in that

03:45.345 --> 03:46.012
living room?

03:46.012 --> 03:46.880
Yeah, this your house, partner.

03:46.880 --> 03:47.814
Yes, so you...

03:47.814 --> 03:48.749
Yeah, this your crib.

03:48.749 --> 03:49.449
...and our family

03:49.449 --> 03:51.017
could have a comfortable place

03:51.017 --> 03:53.954
to live.

03:53.954 --> 03:54.788
I'm‐a just leave it at

03:54.788 --> 03:55.455
that.

03:55.455 --> 03:56.757
Okay. Well, I'm‐a

03:56.757 --> 03:57.924
just leave this at this: I'm

03:57.924 --> 03:58.759
getting the apartment with or

03:58.759 --> 04:01.401
without your consent.

04:01.401 --> 04:02.402
You tripping.

04:02.402 --> 04:04.470
Don't do that.

04:15.682 --> 04:16.983
Oh, this is adorable.

04:16.983 --> 04:17.884
This is, like, so romantic and

04:18.552 --> 04:19.385
Oh, my God, how frickin' pretty

04:19.385 --> 04:20.053
is this?

04:20.053 --> 04:21.087
Sit, I will get you

04:21.087 --> 04:21.755
wine lists here.

04:21.755 --> 04:23.056
Wine list, of course.

04:23.056 --> 04:26.960
Of course.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.595
bat these flies

04:28.595 --> 04:29.262
away.

04:29.262 --> 04:30.263
I'm just gonna s...

04:30.263 --> 04:32.566
Yeah.

04:34.701 --> 04:36.469
We are in Lake Tahoe

04:36.469 --> 04:39.706
for a girls trip, and there has

04:39.706 --> 04:42.008
been‐‐ woof‐‐ drama on a whole

04:42.008 --> 04:43.677
other level, but it seems like

04:43.677 --> 04:45.646
everyone is, you know, happy,

04:45.646 --> 04:47.380
and I feel kind of like the

04:47.380 --> 04:48.749
outcast right now.

04:48.749 --> 04:51.051
But I am really, really trying

04:51.051 --> 04:52.786
to be hopeful and positive that

04:52.786 --> 04:54.821
we have a great bonding

04:54.821 --> 04:56.189
experience.

04:56.189 --> 04:56.957
You good, sis?

04:56.957 --> 04:57.624
Mm‐hmm.

04:57.624 --> 04:58.291
You sure?

04:58.291 --> 04:59.259
I'm good, I'm good, I'm

04:59.259 --> 04:59.993
good, I'm good.

04:59.993 --> 05:01.568
I'm very, very, very good.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.503
You know what I was

05:02.503 --> 05:03.169
thinking of, you guys?

05:03.169 --> 05:04.538
Just 'cause, like, we're all

05:04.538 --> 05:05.839
here and it's, like, really

05:05.839 --> 05:06.507
cool.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.674
I'm gonna be 26 and I don't know

05:07.674 --> 05:08.642
how to swim, which is crazy.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.475
Mm‐hmm.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.410
But also because I am

05:10.410 --> 05:11.444
scared of deep water, that's

05:11.444 --> 05:12.445
probably the reason why I never

05:12.445 --> 05:13.113
learned how to swim.

05:13.113 --> 05:13.780
Yeah.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.015
But I was just, like,

05:15.015 --> 05:15.816
sitting here, like, thinking to

05:15.816 --> 05:17.083
myself, "I'd be interested to

05:17.083 --> 05:19.520
know what your guys' biggest

05:19.520 --> 05:21.755
fears are," you know?

05:21.755 --> 05:22.589
Like, what are‐what are you

05:22.589 --> 05:23.824
scared to do, like...

05:23.824 --> 05:24.791
I'm so terrified of

05:24.791 --> 05:25.526
heights.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.492
I hate the thought of being up

05:26.492 --> 05:27.160
high.

05:27.160 --> 05:27.828
You arranged

05:27.828 --> 05:28.494
parasailing.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.329
That could be, like, something

05:29.329 --> 05:29.996
we can help you with.

05:29.996 --> 05:30.664
Yeah.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.364
I'm not going

05:31.364 --> 05:32.232
parasailing.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.134
I love that, Paige.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.068
All of us conquering fears this

05:35.068 --> 05:36.136
week, I think we should do that.

05:36.136 --> 05:36.937
Nattie, you're gonna do

05:36.937 --> 05:37.604
it?

05:37.604 --> 05:38.371
It's, like, a good

05:38.371 --> 05:39.039
bonding, like...

05:39.039 --> 05:39.773
What's your, like,

05:39.773 --> 05:40.440
thing, Nicole?

05:40.440 --> 05:41.608
...church camp week.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.744
Mine... What am I scared of?

05:43.744 --> 05:45.111
One that sticks out, like,

05:45.111 --> 05:46.379
immediate, it could be

05:46.379 --> 05:47.347
commitment.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.114
Oh.

05:48.114 --> 05:48.782
Oh.

05:48.782 --> 05:49.550
So you're just scared

05:49.550 --> 05:50.216
of relationship.

05:50.216 --> 05:50.884
Yeah, there's a

05:50.884 --> 05:51.552
difference.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.218
Yeah.

05:52.218 --> 05:53.286
I know a thing you love

05:53.286 --> 05:55.455
to do but you never, like,

05:55.455 --> 05:56.422
you're too scared to, like, talk

05:56.422 --> 05:57.524
about.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.191
What?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.325
Nicole loves to write

05:59.325 --> 06:00.100
poems.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.234
Ooh!

06:01.234 --> 06:02.603
Oh!

06:02.603 --> 06:04.037
You need to write a poem!

06:04.037 --> 06:04.871
I really like that.

06:04.871 --> 06:05.706
By the end of this

06:05.706 --> 06:07.440
trip... yeah, by the end of this

06:07.440 --> 06:08.374
trip, you need to write... and

06:08.374 --> 06:09.042
it can be about commitment.

06:09.042 --> 06:09.776
Yeah, a poem about

06:09.776 --> 06:10.443
commitment.

06:10.443 --> 06:11.311
Raise your hand if you

06:11.311 --> 06:12.045
want it to be about commitment.

06:12.045 --> 06:12.713
Yeah.

06:12.713 --> 06:13.714
I want her poem to be

06:13.714 --> 06:14.480
about commitment.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.148
Nikki.

06:15.148 --> 06:15.982
Yeah, but there...

06:15.982 --> 06:18.284
Thanks, Brie.

06:18.284 --> 06:19.185
Oh, God.

06:19.185 --> 06:20.353
Well, now that Brie has told the

06:20.353 --> 06:21.522
world about my poetry writing,

06:21.522 --> 06:23.223
it's embarrassing to me.

06:23.223 --> 06:24.625
I've been writing poetry since

06:24.625 --> 06:25.792
third grade.

06:25.792 --> 06:26.827
It's just something that I've

06:26.827 --> 06:28.128
always kept to myself.

06:28.128 --> 06:29.630
I don't tell anyone that I write

06:29.630 --> 06:30.697
poetry.

06:30.697 --> 06:32.098
My poetry's my diary, and that

06:32.098 --> 06:34.100
is one of my fears, is reciting

06:34.100 --> 06:36.837
a poem publicly to people, so

06:36.837 --> 06:38.939
I'm going to conquer my fear

06:38.939 --> 06:40.306
like all the other girls.

06:40.306 --> 06:41.808
Come on, Nia.

06:41.808 --> 06:42.509
Who, me?

06:42.509 --> 06:43.710
I don't know, it's just, like,

06:43.710 --> 06:46.780
I've been in a funk all day.

06:46.780 --> 06:47.981
Being in such an extravagant

06:47.981 --> 06:50.216
place, like, with all these

06:50.216 --> 06:53.286
fancy things and... I didn't...

06:53.286 --> 06:55.088
like, w‐we didn't grow up... I

06:55.088 --> 06:56.256
grew up in, like, a re... my mom

06:56.256 --> 06:57.223
had, like, this red minivan she

06:57.223 --> 06:58.458
could barely afford that, like,

06:58.458 --> 07:00.667
almost got repo'd, that we'd

07:00.667 --> 07:02.068
all, like, you know, hop in and,

07:02.068 --> 07:03.737
like, drive, just 'cause, like,

07:03.737 --> 07:04.605
we couldn't afford, like,

07:04.605 --> 07:05.939
vacations and stuff, and, like,

07:05.939 --> 07:09.409
now I get to be in this amazing

07:09.409 --> 07:11.778
mansion, without my family...

07:11.778 --> 07:15.181
Yeah.

07:15.181 --> 07:16.249
I just don't feel like I

07:16.249 --> 07:16.917
belong.

07:16.917 --> 07:18.552
I'm not used to this kind of

07:18.552 --> 07:19.953
lavishness, I guess.

07:19.953 --> 07:21.855
Coming from really humble

07:21.855 --> 07:23.456
beginnings; literally my whole

07:23.456 --> 07:25.291
life, shared a bedroom with my

07:25.291 --> 07:26.627
two brothers.

07:26.627 --> 07:28.695
It's so amazing, and really cool

07:28.695 --> 07:30.330
to wake up in this huge mansion,

07:30.330 --> 07:31.732
and it's, like, the most

07:31.732 --> 07:32.899
beautiful view you've ever seen

07:32.899 --> 07:34.467
in your life, but that is one of

07:34.467 --> 07:36.036
my biggest fears.

07:36.036 --> 07:38.038
Just, I feel...

07:38.038 --> 07:39.806
I don't know, like, I... maybe

07:39.806 --> 07:41.074
I don't deserve to be here.

07:41.074 --> 07:42.142
Or maybe that I don't fit in.

07:42.142 --> 07:43.376
Wait, I want to hear what Brie's

07:43.376 --> 07:44.377
scared of.

07:44.377 --> 07:45.912
I'm scared of Tahoe

07:45.912 --> 07:47.781
Tessie, the Loch Ness Monster

07:47.781 --> 07:49.215
that lives in the bottom of the

07:49.215 --> 07:49.883
lake.

07:49.883 --> 07:51.217
She's definitely in

07:51.217 --> 07:53.319
Brie mode right now.

07:53.319 --> 07:54.354
Brie, Tahoe Tessie doesn't

07:54.354 --> 07:55.021
exist.

07:55.021 --> 07:56.890
Okay, in 2006, a

07:56.890 --> 07:59.492
bartender was making a drink, he

07:59.492 --> 08:00.901
looked out at the lake and he

08:00.901 --> 08:02.869
saw a big, black hump and he saw

08:02.869 --> 08:04.437
it go down really quick.

08:04.437 --> 08:05.105
Oh, really?

08:05.105 --> 08:05.972
There has been so many

08:05.972 --> 08:07.007
sightings.

08:07.007 --> 08:09.442
In the 19th century, the Native

08:09.442 --> 08:13.379
Americans saw Tahoe Tessie.

08:13.379 --> 08:15.782
Tahoe Tessie is this Loch Ness

08:15.782 --> 08:17.651
Monster that lives deep in the

08:17.651 --> 08:19.185
waters of Lake Tahoe.

08:19.185 --> 08:21.755
And as kids, I swear, when I was

08:21.755 --> 08:23.724
swimming in the lake, I saw

08:23.724 --> 08:25.526
shadows, which might be

08:25.526 --> 08:27.060
friendly, but at any moment, if

08:27.060 --> 08:28.695
she's hangry, or she gets mad,

08:28.695 --> 08:29.663
I'm done.

08:29.663 --> 08:31.632
And there's something about the

08:31.632 --> 08:34.333
water and me, it freaks me out.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.434
Tahoe Tessie's real.

08:35.434 --> 08:36.135
Lana, what are you

08:36.135 --> 08:36.803
scared of?

08:36.803 --> 08:37.470
I think you're afraid of

08:37.470 --> 08:38.138
failing.

08:38.138 --> 08:38.804
Damn, Nattie.

08:38.804 --> 08:39.472
No.

08:39.472 --> 08:40.173
What are you scared

08:40.173 --> 08:40.841
of?

08:40.841 --> 08:41.842
I'm trying to get down to the

08:41.842 --> 08:42.509
heart of what's...

08:42.509 --> 08:43.409
No, no, no, no, you're

08:43.409 --> 08:44.645
right on.

08:44.645 --> 08:45.311
I'm definitely afraid of

08:45.311 --> 08:45.979
failing.

08:45.979 --> 08:49.482
That, and, um, I guess I always

08:49.482 --> 08:50.651
feel like I'm on the outside.

08:50.651 --> 08:51.484
Is your fear, like, not

08:51.484 --> 08:52.152
fitting in?

08:52.152 --> 08:53.353
Well, I grew up as the

08:53.353 --> 08:54.655
only American, so I grew up as a

08:54.655 --> 08:55.321
minority.

08:55.321 --> 08:56.389
They told me I was stupid and

08:56.389 --> 08:57.558
fat and dumb.

08:57.558 --> 08:59.993
"You smile too much, you laugh

08:59.993 --> 09:01.434
too much, you must be fake as

09:02.368 --> 09:03.737
I was like, " you, I'm

09:03.737 --> 09:05.338
not fake, and I'm sorry I

09:05.338 --> 09:06.339
smile," but it actually

09:06.339 --> 09:08.041
hit the nerve of when I was ten

09:08.041 --> 09:09.910
years old, of people being,

09:09.910 --> 09:11.545
like, "Oh, you're American,

09:11.545 --> 09:13.346
you're happy and you smile?

09:13.346 --> 09:16.116
That means you're weak."

09:16.116 --> 09:17.017
That breaks my heart.

09:17.017 --> 09:17.718
That is tough.

09:17.718 --> 09:18.519
And the girls can

09:18.519 --> 09:19.319
back me up on this.

09:19.319 --> 09:20.386
Everyone loves you, first of

09:20.386 --> 09:21.454
all, and you know I love you

09:21.454 --> 09:22.155
dearly.

09:22.155 --> 09:23.089
My‐my parents are obsessed with

09:23.089 --> 09:23.824
you.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.058
When Lana confesses that her

09:25.058 --> 09:26.426
biggest fear is fitting in, it

09:26.426 --> 09:27.728
actually makes a lot of sense.

09:27.728 --> 09:29.095
There are moments that Lana is a

09:29.095 --> 09:30.130
little socially awkward.

09:30.130 --> 09:31.031
I'm gonna show you the

09:31.031 --> 09:32.032
two things that I actually had

09:32.032 --> 09:32.866
worked on already.

09:32.866 --> 09:34.100
I think a great way

09:34.100 --> 09:35.101
to jumpstart a match is if

09:35.101 --> 09:36.002
somebody attacked you mid‐dance.

09:36.937 --> 09:37.804
Obviously, being in

09:37.804 --> 09:38.672
the village was not you.

09:38.672 --> 09:39.740
You're such a city girl.

09:39.740 --> 09:40.741
Excuse me?

09:40.741 --> 09:44.578
I grew up on a farm.

09:44.578 --> 09:45.646
But that is the Lana

09:45.646 --> 09:47.514
that I have grown to love, and

09:47.514 --> 09:48.949
what Lana needs to understand is

09:48.949 --> 09:50.216
that we love her, too, and that

09:50.216 --> 09:51.384
we have her back as well.

09:51.384 --> 09:52.953
I have an idea.

09:52.953 --> 09:54.320
How about this: because you

09:54.320 --> 09:55.689
don't think that you belong, I

09:55.689 --> 09:56.723
want to show you how much we

09:56.723 --> 09:57.558
love you and how much we're

09:57.558 --> 09:58.559
there for you and how much we

09:58.559 --> 10:00.026
have your back and I believe in

10:00.026 --> 10:01.101
you, how about you stand on that

10:01.101 --> 10:03.069
ledge, and all of us are gonna

10:03.069 --> 10:04.337
stand behind you, and you're

10:04.337 --> 10:05.005
gonna have to fall.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.239
Close your eyes and fall and we

10:06.239 --> 10:07.307
will catch you.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.108
We're all in heels...

10:08.108 --> 10:09.042
I like your idea,

10:09.042 --> 10:09.710
Nattie.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.711
We love you dearly.

10:10.711 --> 10:11.377
Oh, my God.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.212
Do you trust us?

10:12.212 --> 10:13.046
Do you trust us?

10:13.046 --> 10:13.947
Does this mean that I'm

10:13.947 --> 10:15.015
accepted?

10:15.015 --> 10:16.016
Yes.

10:16.016 --> 10:16.850
Oh, my God, that's so

10:16.850 --> 10:17.518
sad.

10:17.518 --> 10:18.418
But that's how I feel.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.185
Do you trust us?

10:19.185 --> 10:19.986
You don't need to try

10:19.986 --> 10:20.654
to be accepted...

10:20.654 --> 10:21.321
I got you.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.122
You're amazing for who

10:22.122 --> 10:22.789
you are.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.624
We have you, babe.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.525
Look at how cute your

10:24.525 --> 10:25.358
butt looks in those pants.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.192
Yeah, it looks great.

10:32.599 --> 10:33.767
Oh, my God, that

10:33.767 --> 10:36.102
scared me more than it scared...

10:36.102 --> 10:37.303
That was so good!

10:37.303 --> 10:39.740
We got you, babe.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.406
Oh, that was crazy.

10:40.406 --> 10:41.808
We love you.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.111
Nattie! Nattie!

10:45.111 --> 10:47.080
My heart is racing.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.284
I don't think I can go

10:51.284 --> 10:52.285
in deep water, and I feel like

10:52.285 --> 10:53.620
such a.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.588
Talking about something that

10:54.588 --> 10:56.156
gives me so much anxiety, being

10:56.156 --> 10:57.290
in deep water without really

10:57.290 --> 10:58.291
knowing how to swim.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.526
It makes me feel really

10:59.526 --> 11:01.334
sad, like, I didn't know.

11:01.334 --> 11:02.736
I've realized through

11:02.736 --> 11:04.204
the things that I've gone with

11:04.204 --> 11:05.806
with Paige this week, sometimes

11:05.806 --> 11:08.842
an apology will never heal the

11:08.842 --> 11:10.911
damage that has been done.

11:18.819 --> 11:20.253
So I don't know if you

11:20.253 --> 11:21.487
guys are excited or not, but

11:21.487 --> 11:22.556
we're gonna go search for Tahoe

11:22.556 --> 11:23.223
Tessie.

11:23.223 --> 11:24.357
Okay, let's do it.

11:24.357 --> 11:25.491
Nicole told me this

11:25.491 --> 11:26.727
morning that Lake Tahoe is the

11:26.727 --> 11:27.894
deepest, like, lake in the

11:27.894 --> 11:28.562
world.

11:28.562 --> 11:29.796
And that's why Tahoe

11:29.796 --> 11:30.897
Tessie really exists.

11:30.897 --> 11:32.032
Um, not... deepest

11:32.032 --> 11:33.233
lake in the world that's

11:33.233 --> 11:33.900
natural, not man‐made.

11:33.900 --> 11:34.801
I didn't realize it

11:34.801 --> 11:36.002
was that deep.

11:36.002 --> 11:37.237
So deep; I think that's

11:37.237 --> 11:38.271
why all the myths are true.

11:38.271 --> 11:39.072
They definitely don't

11:39.072 --> 11:40.106
know what's at the bottom of the

11:40.106 --> 11:40.774
lake, that's for sure.

11:40.774 --> 11:41.575
Then her body

11:41.575 --> 11:42.242
decomposed and fed all the

11:42.242 --> 11:42.909
fishies.

11:42.909 --> 11:43.744
Nobody's ever gone down

11:43.744 --> 11:44.410
there?

11:44.410 --> 11:45.278
I don't believe so.

11:45.278 --> 11:46.547
No, I don't think you

11:46.547 --> 11:48.549
can.

11:48.549 --> 11:49.683
I'm very surprised to

11:49.683 --> 11:51.117
find out how deep the lake is.

11:51.117 --> 11:52.218
It definitely makes me nervous.

11:52.218 --> 11:53.219
You don't know what's down

11:53.219 --> 11:53.887
there.

11:53.887 --> 11:54.955
I don't know, lake sharks or

11:54.955 --> 11:55.622
something?

11:55.622 --> 11:56.857
I don't know what living in

11:56.857 --> 11:57.624
there, like, freaking Tahoe

11:57.624 --> 11:58.291
Tessie.

11:58.291 --> 11:59.526
I've never tried to learn how to

11:59.526 --> 12:00.701
swim because I'm scared of deep

12:00.701 --> 12:01.635
water, like, I'm, like, wh‐when

12:01.635 --> 12:02.736
am I ever gonna put myself in

12:02.736 --> 12:03.403
deep water?

12:03.403 --> 12:04.638
I mean, I'm gonna need it in

12:04.638 --> 12:05.672
case someone pushes me off a

12:05.672 --> 12:06.439
boat one day.

12:06.439 --> 12:07.508
I don't even know what

12:07.508 --> 12:08.241
we're doing right now.

12:08.241 --> 12:09.175
We're getting connected

12:09.175 --> 12:10.410
to a parachute right now and

12:10.410 --> 12:11.344
going in the air.

12:11.344 --> 12:12.278
Nattie, how are you

12:12.278 --> 12:13.379
feeling, are you gonna go up and

12:13.379 --> 12:14.047
do it?

12:14.047 --> 12:14.815
I think everyone

12:14.815 --> 12:15.849
wants to do this and everyone

12:15.849 --> 12:17.350
wants me to do this, so I'm just

12:17.350 --> 12:18.785
wanting to do it to, like, make

12:18.785 --> 12:19.920
everyone happy, but I feel,

12:19.920 --> 12:21.187
like, a pit in my stomach doing

12:21.187 --> 12:21.855
this.

12:21.855 --> 12:23.189
Well, I mean, don't

12:23.189 --> 12:23.890
feel forced.

12:23.890 --> 12:25.025
Whatever you feel like

12:25.025 --> 12:25.892
doing.

12:25.892 --> 12:26.960
I got nervous.

12:26.960 --> 12:27.894
You're good, you're

12:27.894 --> 12:29.730
good, good‐bye!

12:29.730 --> 12:30.797
♪ I'm the woman

12:30.797 --> 12:31.698
You're the man

12:31.698 --> 12:33.333
♪ Burn it down, crank it up

12:33.333 --> 12:34.968
Paint the town, shake it up

12:34.968 --> 12:35.736
Hey! ♪

12:35.736 --> 12:39.272
So much fun!

12:39.272 --> 12:40.807
Oh, my God.

12:40.807 --> 12:41.808
I don't know if we can do this.

12:41.808 --> 12:43.910
That is so high.

12:43.910 --> 12:45.045
Nattie, we have to go.

12:45.045 --> 12:46.279
Let me see them come

12:46.279 --> 12:47.113
down.

12:47.113 --> 12:48.715
I honestly feel like throwing

12:48.715 --> 12:49.382
up.

12:49.382 --> 12:51.151
This whole parasailing thing is

12:51.151 --> 12:54.187
making me sick to my stomach.

12:54.187 --> 12:55.856
Oh, my God, it's

12:55.856 --> 12:56.857
amazing!

12:56.857 --> 12:58.091
I feel like my legs

12:58.091 --> 12:59.025
are sha... Oh!

12:59.025 --> 13:00.033
Look at those girls up

13:00.033 --> 13:00.701
there.

13:00.701 --> 13:02.268
Girls! Girls!

13:06.272 --> 13:08.609
What's up, bitches!

13:11.444 --> 13:13.580
Baby Jeezy.

13:13.580 --> 13:14.781
I missed the first

13:14.781 --> 13:17.250
few days of Tahoe because I was

13:17.250 --> 13:19.119
in Atlanta with Uncle Buck.

13:19.119 --> 13:20.554
Everything is so beautiful.

13:20.554 --> 13:22.388
I already feel at‐at peace and

13:22.388 --> 13:23.323
less stress.

13:26.126 --> 13:27.628
I'm not just thinking about my

13:27.628 --> 13:29.462
living situation back in

13:29.462 --> 13:32.065
Pensacola, and to see my girls,

13:32.065 --> 13:33.366
like, it instantly put a smile

13:33.366 --> 13:34.134
on my face.

13:34.134 --> 13:35.368
Trin, will you go up

13:35.368 --> 13:36.036
with me?

13:36.036 --> 13:37.170
Yes, baby Jeezy.

13:37.170 --> 13:39.906
Nattie! Nattie! Nattie!

13:39.906 --> 13:43.009
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!

13:43.009 --> 13:44.110
Oh...

13:44.110 --> 13:45.245
All right, I'm ready

13:45.245 --> 13:46.012
when you are.

13:46.012 --> 13:47.447
I just need to do it.

13:47.447 --> 13:48.582
Just need to do it.

13:48.582 --> 13:50.817
Unbreakable.

13:50.817 --> 13:52.352
I finally decide I

13:52.352 --> 13:54.320
just need to face this fear

13:54.320 --> 13:54.988
head‐on.

13:54.988 --> 13:56.757
Don't go too high.

13:56.757 --> 13:57.924
Don't go too high.

13:59.325 --> 14:00.667
I'm really freaked

14:00.667 --> 14:02.903
out, but as we go up, I suddenly

14:02.903 --> 14:05.405
feel at peace and I'm not afraid

14:05.405 --> 14:06.807
of doing this.

14:06.807 --> 14:09.342
You did it!

14:11.311 --> 14:12.278
Holy!

14:12.278 --> 14:13.179
Holy!

14:13.179 --> 14:14.447
Nicole told me not to

14:14.447 --> 14:18.151
look down, but look at the view.

14:21.855 --> 14:25.258
I did it!

14:25.258 --> 14:26.893
My heart is racing.

14:38.004 --> 14:39.005
Journaling has been

14:39.005 --> 14:39.740
great.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.575
I get to actually see the

14:41.575 --> 14:43.209
thoughts that I feel inside my

14:43.209 --> 14:45.311
head, which make it real for me.

14:45.311 --> 14:47.413
I've had such an incredible year

14:47.413 --> 14:50.551
in the WWE and in my life.

14:50.551 --> 14:51.685
I mean, I'm really, really

14:51.685 --> 14:53.119
blessed to be here, but I'm also

14:53.119 --> 14:55.055
kind of, like, feeling weird

14:55.055 --> 14:55.856
about it.

14:55.856 --> 14:56.623
Not ungrateful, I'm not

14:56.623 --> 14:57.290
ungrateful.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.525
I don't want that to sound

14:58.525 --> 14:59.826
ungrateful, but it's hard for me

14:59.826 --> 15:01.001
to fully enjoy it because‐‐ I

15:01.001 --> 15:02.235
don't know‐‐ I feel a little

15:02.235 --> 15:03.904
selfish.

15:03.904 --> 15:04.938
Sister.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.372
Hey, sis.

15:06.372 --> 15:07.541
So, you ready?

15:07.541 --> 15:08.308
For the...

15:08.308 --> 15:09.710
To conquer your swimming

15:09.710 --> 15:10.376
fear?

15:10.376 --> 15:11.111
Yeah.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.045
Get in that water?

15:12.045 --> 15:12.779
Yeah.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.380
No life jacket?

15:14.380 --> 15:15.381
I don't know about

15:15.381 --> 15:16.049
that one.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.283
I didn't realize how deep the

15:17.283 --> 15:18.051
water was, honestly.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.185
Like, it terrified me.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.320
I was just crying 'cause I was,

15:20.320 --> 15:21.321
like, I don't think I can go in

15:21.321 --> 15:22.322
deep water.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.323
Yeah.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.490
And I feel like such

15:24.490 --> 15:25.491
a.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.127
No, you're not.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.929
Oh, God, no.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.163
That makes me feel really sad,

15:30.163 --> 15:31.097
like, I didn't know.

15:31.097 --> 15:31.865
I feel bad 'cause

15:31.865 --> 15:32.699
everyone else is, like,

15:32.699 --> 15:34.100
overcoming their stuff and,

15:34.100 --> 15:35.235
like, being open about it.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.604
I just‐I just can't do it.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.872
Some phobias you can't just do

15:38.872 --> 15:39.540
overnight.

15:39.540 --> 15:40.607
You know, like, when you r...

15:40.607 --> 15:41.842
like, here, when you run up the

15:41.842 --> 15:42.843
stairs and you feel like you're

15:42.843 --> 15:43.510
out of breath?

15:43.510 --> 15:44.244
That's how I felt.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.145
It's almost like a

15:45.145 --> 15:46.146
suffocation to think that you

15:46.146 --> 15:47.180
can't control if you can't get

15:47.180 --> 15:48.114
out of the water.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.149
And I don't like being

15:49.149 --> 15:50.250
in, like, situations that I

15:50.250 --> 15:50.917
can't control.

15:50.917 --> 15:51.685
Exactly.

15:51.685 --> 15:52.452
Talking about

15:52.452 --> 15:53.687
something that gives me so much

15:53.687 --> 15:55.488
anxiety‐‐ being in deep water

15:55.488 --> 15:56.690
without really knowing how to

15:56.690 --> 15:58.124
swim‐‐ it just reminds me of

15:58.124 --> 15:59.059
past relationships and the stuff

15:59.059 --> 16:00.366
that I did for the last year and

16:00.366 --> 16:01.034
a half.

16:01.034 --> 16:02.536
I don't like having no control

16:02.536 --> 16:03.670
over stuff anymore.

16:03.670 --> 16:04.905
It's not because I'm mad, not

16:04.905 --> 16:06.039
because I'm sad, it's 'cause

16:06.039 --> 16:06.973
I'm, like, freaking out.

16:06.973 --> 16:08.474
I, throughout my whole life,

16:08.474 --> 16:09.876
defended my... like, defended

16:09.876 --> 16:11.111
myself, I didn't need anyone to,

16:11.111 --> 16:12.546
like, help me, so I feel like

16:12.546 --> 16:13.980
this kind of thing makes me feel

16:13.980 --> 16:14.848
very vulnerable.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.082
I just‐I just hate people seeing

16:16.082 --> 16:17.117
me so freaking weak.

16:17.117 --> 16:18.018
Everyone's, like, overcoming and

16:18.018 --> 16:18.685
being strong.

16:18.685 --> 16:19.452
This isn't weak.

16:19.452 --> 16:20.353
I personally can't do

16:20.353 --> 16:21.221
it, I'm sorry, guys.

16:21.221 --> 16:22.255
There's always gonna be one that

16:22.255 --> 16:23.089
can't overcome.

16:23.089 --> 16:23.990
You know what, this

16:23.990 --> 16:25.025
isn't weakness, like, this is

16:25.025 --> 16:26.292
strength admitting it and, like,

16:26.292 --> 16:27.694
that's fine.

16:27.694 --> 16:28.829
And don't go tubing either.

16:28.829 --> 16:29.763
No, I want to go

16:29.763 --> 16:30.597
tubing with Nikki 'cause then,

16:30.597 --> 16:31.364
uh, we'll be wearing... Yeah.

16:31.364 --> 16:32.298
That's very... that's a

16:32.298 --> 16:32.966
lot of work.

16:32.966 --> 16:33.800
No, no, but we're

16:33.800 --> 16:34.568
gonna be going, like, five miles

16:34.568 --> 16:35.268
an hour, so it's fine.

16:35.268 --> 16:36.603
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

16:36.603 --> 16:37.270
And we have a

16:37.270 --> 16:38.138
professional on the boat, so I

16:38.138 --> 16:38.805
think it'll be fine.

16:38.805 --> 16:40.140
There's this man that's gonna

16:40.140 --> 16:40.807
be here.

16:40.807 --> 16:42.175
He can jump in and save me.

16:42.175 --> 16:42.976
There's a professional.

16:42.976 --> 16:43.777
Yeah, that's what I

16:43.777 --> 16:45.145
need, a professional.

16:48.281 --> 16:49.415
I have to journal

16:49.415 --> 16:50.717
after this, too.

16:50.717 --> 16:51.818
I already journaled.

16:51.818 --> 16:52.819
Felt really good.

16:52.819 --> 16:53.820
It's very therapeutic.

16:53.820 --> 16:54.487
It is.

16:54.487 --> 16:55.221
It was very

16:55.221 --> 16:56.657
eye‐opening to me about a lot of

16:56.657 --> 16:57.724
things about myself.

16:57.724 --> 16:58.959
It feels like your mind

16:58.959 --> 17:00.366
is, like... 'cause it's so

17:00.366 --> 17:01.034
quiet, like...

17:01.034 --> 17:01.835
With the journaling?

17:01.835 --> 17:02.503
Yeah.

17:02.503 --> 17:03.436
It's so nice.

17:03.436 --> 17:04.505
When I'm on trips like

17:04.505 --> 17:06.906
this, I have this big tug‐of‐war

17:06.906 --> 17:10.443
with my heart of, like, being

17:10.443 --> 17:13.113
here and feeling really free

17:13.113 --> 17:15.448
and, um, feeling like youthful

17:15.448 --> 17:17.483
Brie and feeling young again

17:17.483 --> 17:19.385
and, um, feeling like how I did

17:19.385 --> 17:20.686
before marriage, how I did

17:20.686 --> 17:21.855
before, you know, having a

17:21.855 --> 17:23.890
child, but then every time I go

17:23.890 --> 17:25.391
to bed, I get this really

17:25.391 --> 17:26.727
overwhelming sadness that I'm

17:26.727 --> 17:28.094
not gonna wake up with Birdie,

17:28.094 --> 17:29.963
and then because of the guilt,

17:29.963 --> 17:31.197
you sit there and you think,

17:31.197 --> 17:32.633
like, I don't ever want it to

17:32.633 --> 17:34.701
come off that I'm happier, like,

17:34.701 --> 17:36.136
doing these trips without her

17:36.136 --> 17:37.370
because I'm just so happy with

17:37.370 --> 17:39.272
her, too, but it's, like, such a

17:39.272 --> 17:40.541
mind game.

17:40.541 --> 17:42.208
It's just, it‐it gets very

17:42.208 --> 17:43.043
overwhelming.

17:43.043 --> 17:45.546
Yeah.

17:45.546 --> 17:46.813
I strongly believe

17:46.813 --> 17:48.314
that when you have kids, like,

17:48.314 --> 17:49.249
your life shouldn't stop.

17:49.249 --> 17:50.016
It shouldn't.

17:50.016 --> 17:50.984
Yeah, it's true, it's

17:50.984 --> 17:51.652
true.

17:51.652 --> 17:52.586
And your happiness

17:52.586 --> 17:54.454
and you‐you staying mentally

17:54.454 --> 17:56.122
healthy and good and trips like

17:56.122 --> 17:57.858
this to get away so you can

17:57.858 --> 18:00.300
recharge and you can feel good

18:00.300 --> 18:02.202
and you'll be even better when

18:02.202 --> 18:03.637
you go back to her 'cause you're

18:03.637 --> 18:05.438
gonna miss her.

18:05.438 --> 18:07.841
I feel like, as women, we wear

18:07.841 --> 18:09.209
so many hats, especially the

18:09.209 --> 18:10.143
women I work with.

18:10.143 --> 18:11.845
We're all so strong‐minded,

18:11.845 --> 18:13.179
we're all so independent, and

18:13.179 --> 18:14.848
we're all like, "I'm Superwoman,

18:14.848 --> 18:16.650
I can do anything," but

18:16.650 --> 18:19.620
sometimes it is a lot.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.822
We're human, and sometimes we

18:21.822 --> 18:23.456
just need to check out, get it

18:23.456 --> 18:26.392
together, and come back in the

18:26.392 --> 18:27.060
game.

18:27.060 --> 18:29.162
I think it's fair for you to

18:29.162 --> 18:32.032
have some peace and be happy

18:32.032 --> 18:33.166
and, like, you shouldn't feel

18:33.166 --> 18:34.067
bad about that.

18:34.067 --> 18:34.868
You're a great mom.

18:34.868 --> 18:35.836
The good thing about

18:35.836 --> 18:36.870
you guys is that you're gonna

18:36.870 --> 18:37.971
teach her how to freaking grow

18:37.971 --> 18:39.439
fruit, vegetables, like,

18:39.439 --> 18:40.674
live off the land, actually play

18:40.674 --> 18:41.908
with kids instead of being on

18:41.908 --> 18:43.043
her freaking tablet all day.

18:43.043 --> 18:44.678
Damn, like, I want to be a mom

18:44.678 --> 18:45.512
like Brie.

18:45.512 --> 18:47.914
You're doing it.

18:47.914 --> 18:49.049
I'm trying to convince

18:49.049 --> 18:50.116
these girls that Tahoe Tessie's

18:50.116 --> 18:50.784
real.

18:50.784 --> 18:51.718
That's real, right?

18:51.718 --> 18:52.653
That is real.

18:52.653 --> 18:53.587
Tahoe Tessie is

18:53.587 --> 18:54.821
probably as real as the Loch

18:54.821 --> 18:55.556
Ness Monster.

18:55.556 --> 18:56.857
That's gigantic.

18:56.857 --> 18:57.991
I've just never seen

18:57.991 --> 18:59.726
a successful marriage or

18:59.726 --> 19:00.333
relationship.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.702
No, don't say that!

19:01.702 --> 19:02.669
It scares the‐the

19:02.669 --> 19:03.604
hell out of me.

19:03.604 --> 19:05.005
We both thought, like, "Man,

19:05.005 --> 19:07.073
this... everything isn't okay."

19:13.514 --> 19:14.748
This whole town is so

19:14.748 --> 19:15.415
damn cute.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.182
I know.

19:16.182 --> 19:17.283
Do you guys all know what's

19:17.283 --> 19:18.284
across the street from that

19:18.284 --> 19:18.952
grocery store?

19:18.952 --> 19:19.620
No.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.554
No.

19:20.554 --> 19:21.421
The museum.

19:21.421 --> 19:22.188
For what?

19:22.188 --> 19:23.990
Of Tahoe Tessie.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.526
If they have a museum on Tahoe

19:25.526 --> 19:26.693
Tessie, means it's real.

19:26.693 --> 19:29.963
Does it?

19:33.934 --> 19:35.435
So I'm trying to

19:35.435 --> 19:36.903
convince these girls that Tahoe

19:36.903 --> 19:38.805
Tessie's real, and so I know

19:38.805 --> 19:39.940
this is the spot where...

19:39.940 --> 19:40.874
Well, it is.

19:40.874 --> 19:41.808
It's very much real.

19:41.808 --> 19:42.976
Right? Mm‐hmm.

19:42.976 --> 19:44.110
When Brie says that

19:44.110 --> 19:46.246
Tahoe Tessie is her real fear, I

19:46.246 --> 19:47.681
play along with it because I

19:47.681 --> 19:49.482
love Brie, but Tahoe Tessie is

19:49.482 --> 19:50.717
probably as real as the Loch

19:50.717 --> 19:51.652
Ness Monster.

19:51.652 --> 19:52.886
Are you ready to go

19:52.886 --> 19:53.554
through the exhibit?

19:53.554 --> 19:54.220
Yes.

19:54.220 --> 19:54.921
Okay, wonderful,

19:54.921 --> 19:55.656
let's go this way.

19:55.656 --> 19:56.790
And if Tahoe Tessie

19:56.790 --> 19:58.424
is in Lake Tahoe, I hope to meet

19:58.424 --> 19:59.926
her one day because I have a

19:59.926 --> 20:01.635
feeling she's a very nice girl.

20:01.635 --> 20:02.936
Cryptozoology is the

20:02.936 --> 20:05.238
study of things like the Loch

20:05.238 --> 20:06.707
Ness Monster, Bigfoot.

20:06.707 --> 20:07.974
The Smithsonian does a great

20:07.974 --> 20:09.275
exhibit on the Titanoboa, which

20:09.275 --> 20:11.745
did exist.

20:11.745 --> 20:12.779
That's real, right?

20:12.779 --> 20:13.747
That is real.

20:13.747 --> 20:14.480
Wow.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.149
And this is the one

20:16.149 --> 20:17.518
closest to Lake Tahoe.

20:17.518 --> 20:18.885
This is Unj.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.087
There were giants birds, but it

20:21.087 --> 20:23.757
absolutely could've existed.

20:23.757 --> 20:25.458
Some people do say they have

20:25.458 --> 20:26.126
seen her.

20:26.126 --> 20:27.561
They see the humps, they see the

20:27.561 --> 20:28.228
ripples.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.630
Other people think maybe it's a

20:29.630 --> 20:32.198
giant sturgeon.

20:32.198 --> 20:33.499
Oh!

20:33.499 --> 20:34.701
I think Brie's fear

20:34.701 --> 20:36.436
of Tahoe Tessie is freaking

20:36.436 --> 20:37.638
hilarious.

20:37.638 --> 20:39.472
Trin, Nia, come here.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.607
This is what this is.

20:40.607 --> 20:41.542
This is a hoax.

20:41.542 --> 20:42.408
She's definitely not

20:42.408 --> 20:43.076
a Tessie.

20:43.076 --> 20:43.844
Hell no.

20:43.844 --> 20:44.978
I'm, like, is she

20:44.978 --> 20:45.646
for real?

20:45.646 --> 20:47.213
Or is she messing with us?

20:47.213 --> 20:48.582
I feel like we're the‐the bad

20:48.582 --> 20:49.315
people telling her it's not

20:49.315 --> 20:49.983
real.

20:49.983 --> 20:50.984
I know, but I don't

20:50.984 --> 20:52.185
want to tell Brie it's not real.

20:52.185 --> 20:53.219
Just let her live

20:53.219 --> 20:54.487
her best life and believe in the

20:54.487 --> 20:55.421
damn Tessie.

21:03.003 --> 21:04.470
Ugh, I hate that Brie

21:04.470 --> 21:06.707
put me on the spot with this.

21:06.707 --> 21:09.075
It's, like, hard to, like, force

21:09.075 --> 21:09.743
poetry.

21:09.743 --> 21:10.877
It's not how I write.

21:10.877 --> 21:11.645
Yeah.

21:11.645 --> 21:12.579
'Cause usually when

21:12.579 --> 21:14.581
it's emotion, I just flow it.

21:14.581 --> 21:15.816
I have, like, books full of

21:15.816 --> 21:17.183
poems.

21:17.183 --> 21:18.418
I started when I was super

21:18.418 --> 21:19.853
young, be the only way I could,

21:19.853 --> 21:21.522
like, get stuff out.

21:21.522 --> 21:22.488
You weren't really

21:22.488 --> 21:23.624
prepared for this, like, you

21:23.624 --> 21:25.626
have to use your phone.

21:25.626 --> 21:27.260
Ugh, I feel like I

21:27.260 --> 21:28.461
have writer's block because I'm,

21:28.461 --> 21:30.063
like, forcing it.

21:30.063 --> 21:31.698
Usually, I just flow these out

21:31.698 --> 21:33.534
like no other because I know

21:33.534 --> 21:35.401
they're not gonna be seen, and

21:35.401 --> 21:36.703
now that they're gonna be heard,

21:36.703 --> 21:39.773
I'm, like, scared, nervous.

21:39.773 --> 21:41.274
Ugh, hate it.

21:41.274 --> 21:42.442
Oh, hey, girly.

21:42.442 --> 21:43.443
Oh, you look cute.

21:43.443 --> 21:44.177
Yeah, you do.

21:44.177 --> 21:45.679
Come join us.

21:45.679 --> 21:46.713
Well, I took what you guys said

21:46.713 --> 21:48.014
about, like, coming and kind of

21:48.014 --> 21:49.182
flipping it in my own way.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.383
It's like, okay, I'll put a

21:50.383 --> 21:51.518
base... I'll use that as, like,

21:51.518 --> 21:52.653
my foundation.

21:52.653 --> 21:53.654
Yeah.

21:53.654 --> 21:54.655
To get me into a place

21:54.655 --> 21:57.090
to start to... write.

21:57.090 --> 21:58.759
That's a good idea.

21:58.759 --> 21:59.660
Yeah.

22:02.903 --> 22:03.837
All right, ladies, let's

22:03.837 --> 22:04.838
roll, ready to go.

22:04.838 --> 22:06.406
I'm excited.

22:06.406 --> 22:08.074
Let's do this.

22:08.074 --> 22:09.275
I think my bathing

22:09.275 --> 22:11.477
suit's about to come untied.

22:14.047 --> 22:14.915
I am so excited for

22:14.915 --> 22:16.382
today; who's going tubing?

22:16.382 --> 22:17.317
I want to go...

22:17.317 --> 22:18.018
Are you going tubing?

22:18.018 --> 22:18.752
I'm going tubing.

22:18.752 --> 22:19.452
Are you, Nattie?

22:19.452 --> 22:20.253
I'll do it if Nicole

22:20.253 --> 22:21.054
does it.

22:21.054 --> 22:21.822
Hey, who's going

22:21.822 --> 22:22.556
first?

22:22.556 --> 22:23.489
it, let's go.

22:23.489 --> 22:25.025
Slide me on it.

22:26.660 --> 22:28.529
I'm ready.

22:28.529 --> 22:29.830
Ooh, it's cold.

22:29.830 --> 22:30.997
Oh, , oh, God.

22:30.997 --> 22:32.799
Whoo, yeah, baby.

22:32.799 --> 22:34.434
Ow!

22:42.509 --> 22:43.644
Slow down, slow down,

22:43.644 --> 22:44.477
slow down.

22:44.477 --> 22:45.145
You guys are going,

22:45.145 --> 22:46.246
like, two miles per hour right

22:46.246 --> 22:48.248
now.

22:49.816 --> 22:51.918
Oh, , oh, oh!

22:55.155 --> 22:56.422
Are you okay?

22:56.422 --> 22:57.724
You killed yourself.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.259
That wasn't safe.

22:59.259 --> 23:00.200
You guys have to do

23:00.200 --> 23:01.334
this, it's so much fun.

23:01.334 --> 23:02.503
Paige, you will love it.

23:02.503 --> 23:04.204
For real, not too, too fast for

23:04.204 --> 23:05.071
them.

23:05.071 --> 23:05.906
Yeah, you can't go

23:05.906 --> 23:06.707
fast at all, like, legit.

23:06.707 --> 23:07.874
As I'm seeing Paige get

23:07.874 --> 23:10.176
on the tube with Nikki, I just

23:10.176 --> 23:11.712
know her heart is racing.

23:11.712 --> 23:12.879
Oh,.

23:12.879 --> 23:13.914
This is, like, scary just

23:13.914 --> 23:14.848
getting on here.

23:15.949 --> 23:17.684
Just to be out there,

23:17.684 --> 23:19.385
and you see how huge it is, and

23:19.385 --> 23:20.987
knowing if you flip off, like,

23:20.987 --> 23:22.523
you're just there, waiting for

23:22.523 --> 23:23.657
the boat to come get you.

23:23.657 --> 23:25.425
I know she's nervous right now.

23:25.425 --> 23:26.593
Damn, won't overcome

23:26.593 --> 23:27.460
my fears too soon.

23:27.460 --> 23:29.495
Careful, girls.

23:29.495 --> 23:32.933
Whoo! Yeah.

23:38.304 --> 23:40.006
Oh, wait!

23:40.006 --> 23:41.241
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

23:41.241 --> 23:44.244
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

23:44.244 --> 23:47.013
Paige, are you okay?

23:47.013 --> 23:48.915
Oh, my God.

23:48.915 --> 23:52.018
Hold on, hold on.

23:52.018 --> 23:53.720
Turn back around, you

23:53.720 --> 23:55.055
assholes!

23:55.055 --> 23:55.922
They were going,

23:55.922 --> 23:56.823
honestly, really aggressively

23:56.823 --> 23:57.758
fast.

23:57.758 --> 23:58.792
Pull Paige in.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.066
Wait, wait, wait.

24:00.066 --> 24:01.835
Why, for sake?

24:01.835 --> 24:03.436
Don't fall.

24:03.436 --> 24:05.906
Paige, are you okay?

24:05.906 --> 24:09.810
Paige, hold on.

24:09.810 --> 24:12.045
Whoo.

24:12.045 --> 24:12.879
Paige, how are you

24:12.879 --> 24:13.680
feeling?

24:13.680 --> 24:15.048
One of my phobias is

24:15.048 --> 24:16.783
being in deep water, so it was

24:16.783 --> 24:18.985
literally like, even with a life

24:18.985 --> 24:20.420
jacket, I was so terrified,

24:20.420 --> 24:23.189
I had... I had anxiety for the

24:23.189 --> 24:25.826
rest...

24:26.793 --> 24:29.630
Oh...

24:32.799 --> 24:33.734
Oh, my gosh, when

24:33.734 --> 24:35.335
Paige gets emotional about

24:35.335 --> 24:38.371
tubing and, like, how she had

24:38.371 --> 24:39.472
such anxiety going out on that

24:39.472 --> 24:41.041
water...

24:41.041 --> 24:43.043
That's a really real deep fear.

24:43.043 --> 24:45.345
And that just makes me so sad.

24:45.345 --> 24:46.513
And I really would love to help

24:46.513 --> 24:48.181
her conquer it in any way I can.

24:48.181 --> 24:50.450
I know... I haven't

24:50.450 --> 24:51.552
felt that way in a long time.

24:51.552 --> 24:52.385
Yeah.

24:52.385 --> 24:53.620
So, like, I know

24:53.620 --> 24:54.588
it's, like a life jacket, you're

24:54.588 --> 24:55.522
like, "She's fine."

24:55.522 --> 24:56.389
But it really did, honestly,

24:56.389 --> 24:57.257
terrify me.

24:57.257 --> 24:58.992
Yeah.

25:01.968 --> 25:05.071
Let's do this!

25:05.071 --> 25:06.807
I hope this brings amazingness

25:06.807 --> 25:07.841
to everybody.

25:17.618 --> 25:19.920
Lunch is ready.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.087
Is Lana coming out?

25:21.087 --> 25:21.955
She's coming out.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.289
What a beautiful day.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.157
Mm‐hmm.

25:24.157 --> 25:25.225
I think she's gonna have a...

25:25.225 --> 25:26.827
like, wants to have a talk with

25:26.827 --> 25:27.894
you.

25:27.894 --> 25:30.697
Like a heart‐to‐heart.

25:30.697 --> 25:31.598
I just feel weird

25:31.598 --> 25:32.465
about those, you know?

25:32.465 --> 25:33.934
Mm‐hmm, me too.

25:33.934 --> 25:35.101
Well, I think, though,

25:35.101 --> 25:36.302
communication is a huge

25:36.302 --> 25:37.671
foundation for a relationship,

25:37.671 --> 25:38.739
a friendship.

25:38.739 --> 25:40.641
I hate heart‐to‐hearts, too, but

25:40.641 --> 25:41.642
I think it'd be good for you

25:41.642 --> 25:42.876
guys.

25:42.876 --> 25:43.710
I just can't deal with

25:43.710 --> 25:44.745
anymore.

25:44.745 --> 25:45.779
It's, like, I just have, like,

25:45.779 --> 25:47.180
pent‐up anger where I haven't

25:47.180 --> 25:49.850
let it out in so long that it's

25:49.850 --> 25:51.518
just, like, a single bit of

25:51.518 --> 25:52.385
, I'm just like,

25:52.385 --> 25:53.920
"There, you're done."

25:53.920 --> 25:55.589
I just think it's the way you

25:55.589 --> 25:56.456
get brought up.

25:56.456 --> 25:57.290
You know, my family's never been

25:57.290 --> 25:58.091
like that.

25:58.091 --> 25:59.025
Do you see it's

25:59.025 --> 26:00.026
totally how you are, like,

26:00.026 --> 26:00.801
raised?

26:00.801 --> 26:01.668
'Cause I feel like that's kind

26:01.668 --> 26:03.469
of how we were.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.213
Lana, when there was

26:13.213 --> 26:14.380
conflict in your family, like,

26:14.380 --> 26:16.216
growing up, how did you guys

26:16.216 --> 26:17.417
handle it as a family?

26:17.417 --> 26:19.385
Well, we were massively

26:19.385 --> 26:21.722
disciplined.

26:21.722 --> 26:23.123
My mom was always like, "You can

26:23.123 --> 26:24.390
apologize."

26:24.390 --> 26:25.792
But, like, your mouth is the‐‐

26:25.792 --> 26:26.927
Like, if you didn't control your

26:26.927 --> 26:27.828
mouth, you couldn't control your

26:27.828 --> 26:28.862
whole body.

26:28.862 --> 26:29.830
And I tried to get a lot better.

26:29.830 --> 26:30.864
I was really bad in high school.

26:30.864 --> 26:32.465
I just knew how to say things

26:32.465 --> 26:33.567
that would hurt people.

26:33.567 --> 26:36.236
Like, I knew how I behaved was

26:36.236 --> 26:37.370
wrong, and I needed to be

26:37.370 --> 26:38.639
disciplined for it.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.440
Like, hate... saying "hate" was

26:40.440 --> 26:43.243
never allowed.

26:43.243 --> 26:44.277
I was telling them my

26:44.277 --> 26:45.211
family had, like the gypsy

26:45.211 --> 26:46.046
lifestyle, right?

26:46.046 --> 26:46.847
Mm‐hmm.

26:46.847 --> 26:47.714
So, if anyone had an

26:47.714 --> 26:48.414
issue, even from outside the

26:48.414 --> 26:49.282
family, they'd go out and fight

26:49.282 --> 26:50.350
it out.

26:50.350 --> 26:51.417
Like, literally fist fight.

26:51.417 --> 26:52.152
Like, literally fight?

26:52.152 --> 26:53.620
Yeah, and whoever

26:53.620 --> 26:55.722
wins, the loser buys a drink

26:55.722 --> 26:56.657
for.

26:56.657 --> 26:57.457
That's just how it is.

26:57.457 --> 26:58.291
So, I think that that's where is

26:58.291 --> 26:59.025
stems from.

26:59.025 --> 27:00.026
I'm a maniac when I

27:00.026 --> 27:00.867
start yelling at people.

27:01.968 --> 27:02.836
It's interesting,

27:02.836 --> 27:03.837
though, like how we handle

27:03.837 --> 27:05.872
things differently.

27:11.377 --> 27:12.445
All right, let's get

27:12.445 --> 27:14.414
some pans out, let's do this.

27:19.219 --> 27:20.854
Bake. Bam.

27:20.854 --> 27:22.122
Go catch Tahoe Tessie.

27:22.122 --> 27:23.289
Let's cook her ass.

27:23.289 --> 27:24.390
I bet she good.

27:24.390 --> 27:25.526
Trin and I decide to

27:25.526 --> 27:27.160
cook a family dinner, and...

27:27.160 --> 27:28.194
Oh,.

27:28.194 --> 27:29.395
That's a little burned, but...

27:29.395 --> 27:30.396
When Jon makes

27:30.396 --> 27:31.565
tacos, he don't go through all

27:31.565 --> 27:32.833
this.

27:32.833 --> 27:34.801
On a scale of one to

27:34.801 --> 27:38.404
ten, I am a solid two on the

27:38.404 --> 27:40.140
cooking scale.

27:40.140 --> 27:41.141
What is that?

27:41.141 --> 27:42.008
Fish.

27:42.008 --> 27:42.876
Fish.

27:45.045 --> 27:46.312
Bon appétit, girls.

27:46.312 --> 27:47.881
Dig in.

27:47.881 --> 27:49.382
I'm a little scared.

27:49.382 --> 27:50.250
This looks

27:50.250 --> 27:52.586
interesting.

27:52.586 --> 27:53.820
If it's bad, Nia

27:53.820 --> 27:55.055
cooked everything.

27:55.055 --> 27:56.222
I didn't even know you

27:56.222 --> 27:57.157
guys could cook.

27:57.157 --> 27:59.459
Well, I mean...

27:59.459 --> 28:00.967
It's definitely

28:00.967 --> 28:01.968
different.

28:01.968 --> 28:02.769
It's definitely not

28:02.769 --> 28:03.670
Mexican.

28:03.670 --> 28:04.470
That's not even cooked.

28:04.470 --> 28:05.338
Family night.

28:05.338 --> 28:06.106
I'm giving you guys

28:06.106 --> 28:07.040
a cooking class 101.

28:11.878 --> 28:13.013
Tahoe Tessie doesn't

28:13.013 --> 28:13.814
exist.

28:13.814 --> 28:17.283
Tahoe Tessie's real.

28:17.283 --> 28:20.787
In 2006, a bartender saw a big,

28:20.787 --> 28:22.322
black hump, and he saw it go

28:22.322 --> 28:24.124
down in the lake.

28:24.124 --> 28:26.092
Native Americans saw Tahoe

28:26.092 --> 28:28.494
Tessie.

28:28.494 --> 28:30.230
Oh, my God, get the

28:30.230 --> 28:31.097
out of here.

28:32.365 --> 28:33.499
Oh, Brie!

28:34.467 --> 28:35.468
Brie, stop it.

28:35.468 --> 28:36.402
Tessie!

28:36.402 --> 28:38.705
>> NATTIE and BRIE: Go, Tessie.

28:38.705 --> 28:40.541
Go, Tessie.

28:40.541 --> 28:42.776
What are you doing?

28:42.776 --> 28:44.244
You scared me.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.779
Tessie looked bad.

28:45.779 --> 28:46.947
I tried to come up

28:46.947 --> 28:49.049
behind the buffet thing.

28:49.049 --> 28:51.818
Tahoe Tessie is not real.

28:51.818 --> 28:53.453
I know this.

28:53.453 --> 28:54.354
I'm sorry, but that

28:54.354 --> 28:55.355
was the stupidest I've

28:55.355 --> 28:56.356
ever seen.

28:56.356 --> 28:57.257
But this is what you're

28:57.257 --> 28:58.024
supposed to do on girls trips.

28:58.024 --> 28:59.259
You're supposed to be stupid and

28:59.259 --> 29:00.433
do stupid things.

29:00.433 --> 29:02.202
I just want everyone to kind of,

29:02.202 --> 29:03.904
you know, just know we're having

29:03.904 --> 29:04.971
fun.

29:04.971 --> 29:06.607
Tahoe Tessie...

29:10.544 --> 29:11.277
Hello.

29:11.277 --> 29:12.278
Oh, hi, how are you?

29:12.278 --> 29:13.547
Good. I've got a bunch

29:13.547 --> 29:14.581
of delicious pizzas.

29:14.581 --> 29:15.749
Yay.

29:15.749 --> 29:16.717
There you go.

29:16.717 --> 29:17.951
I totally ordered

29:17.951 --> 29:19.553
pizza because the minute I heard

29:19.553 --> 29:20.587
the, "Oh, , I think I

29:20.587 --> 29:21.822
burned it," I was like,

29:21.822 --> 29:23.590
"Pizza, yes."

29:23.590 --> 29:24.691
Look how many

29:24.691 --> 29:25.458
pizzas you ordered.

29:25.458 --> 29:26.326
All right, whip it out,

29:26.326 --> 29:27.060
let's eat it.

29:27.060 --> 29:27.994
Jesus.

29:27.994 --> 29:28.762
You know, as a backup,

29:28.762 --> 29:29.563
just in case.

29:29.563 --> 29:30.430
Pizza party.

29:30.430 --> 29:31.297
You ordered, like,

29:31.297 --> 29:32.098
nine pizzas.

29:32.098 --> 29:33.066
Wow, this is so good.

29:33.066 --> 29:34.200
All right, so I've

29:34.200 --> 29:35.035
been thinking.

29:35.035 --> 29:35.869
Let's hear it.

29:35.869 --> 29:36.803
For real, for real,

29:36.803 --> 29:37.704
on a shoot, one of my biggest

29:37.704 --> 29:39.339
fears is getting a divorce.

29:39.339 --> 29:41.407
No, don't say that.

29:41.407 --> 29:42.576
Why?

29:42.576 --> 29:44.310
Well, in our family,

29:44.310 --> 29:45.946
both sides, I've just never seen

29:45.946 --> 29:47.948
a successful marriage or

29:47.948 --> 29:49.650
relationship, other than my

29:49.650 --> 29:51.284
grandma and grandpa.

29:51.284 --> 29:52.318
They stayed together till the

29:52.318 --> 29:54.454
end, but it's just a lot.

29:54.454 --> 29:57.423
But that's my fear of, you know,

29:57.423 --> 29:58.725
me and Jon not growing old and

29:58.725 --> 29:59.860
dying together.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.101
Trin...

30:01.101 --> 30:02.836
, dude, that's deep.

30:02.836 --> 30:04.170
Yeah, that is deep.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.271
I've been going

30:05.271 --> 30:06.439
through stuff, and it feels good

30:06.439 --> 30:08.809
to just get it out.

30:08.809 --> 30:10.677
And just the thought of not

30:10.677 --> 30:12.145
having a successful marriage,

30:12.145 --> 30:13.647
that being a possibility that

30:13.647 --> 30:14.848
that can happen, it just...

30:14.848 --> 30:16.817
it scares the hell out of me.

30:16.817 --> 30:18.051
But I feel like you put

30:18.051 --> 30:20.120
so much effort into your family.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.254
Like, especially on top of all

30:21.254 --> 30:22.689
the work we do...

30:22.689 --> 30:23.624
We've been going

30:23.624 --> 30:24.758
through, like, our stuff.

30:24.758 --> 30:25.792
Like, it's been the hardest it's

30:25.792 --> 30:27.761
ever been, and...

30:27.761 --> 30:29.730
Like, I have my home‐‐

30:29.730 --> 30:30.797
We have our home in Pensacola,

30:30.797 --> 30:31.765
but I was like, man, like, I

30:31.765 --> 30:32.899
just feel, like, smothered.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.668
I feel like I'm doing

30:34.668 --> 30:36.036
everything, like everything is

30:36.036 --> 30:36.870
always like‐‐

30:36.870 --> 30:38.104
I'm kind of losing me a little

30:38.104 --> 30:39.205
bit.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.808
It really does scare me.

30:41.808 --> 30:42.676
I want to be with him for the

30:42.676 --> 30:44.044
rest of my life.

30:44.044 --> 30:46.012
But I have just been going

30:46.012 --> 30:49.315
through this routine in order

30:49.315 --> 30:51.685
for him to be happy.

30:51.685 --> 30:52.919
And I don't want him to think

30:52.919 --> 30:55.121
I'm selfish for wanting to do a

30:55.121 --> 30:56.456
little more for myself.

30:56.456 --> 30:57.791
Our careers are, like, picking

30:57.791 --> 30:58.959
up... it's a lot.

30:58.959 --> 31:00.100
I don't know, it's the first

31:00.100 --> 31:01.935
time we've gone through

31:01.935 --> 31:03.369
struggles where we've both

31:03.369 --> 31:04.671
thought, like, man, this...

31:04.671 --> 31:06.172
it's not... everything isn't

31:06.172 --> 31:07.841
okay.

31:10.043 --> 31:11.745
Burn, bitches.

31:11.745 --> 31:12.979
I want all of us to

31:12.979 --> 31:13.980
read our journals.

31:13.980 --> 31:15.348
If we read 'em out loud, we

31:15.348 --> 31:16.683
could just set them free.

31:16.683 --> 31:22.322
I love you guys.

31:24.691 --> 31:25.859
It's the first time

31:25.859 --> 31:27.961
we've gone through struggles

31:27.961 --> 31:29.495
where we've both thought, like,

31:29.495 --> 31:31.064
man, it's not...

31:31.064 --> 31:33.567
Everything isn't okay.

31:33.567 --> 31:34.300
To be fair‐‐

31:34.300 --> 31:35.168
I know this sounds really mean,

31:35.168 --> 31:37.170
but when you marry a significant

31:37.170 --> 31:39.506
other that has kids, you kind of

31:39.506 --> 31:41.441
have to give up a lot more of

31:41.441 --> 31:43.109
yourself for them than they give

31:43.109 --> 31:44.277
up for you.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.345
Oh, yeah.

31:45.345 --> 31:46.947
But you deserve somebody

31:46.947 --> 31:47.781
to give up some for you,

31:47.781 --> 31:49.015
too, though.

31:49.015 --> 31:49.883
Do you know what I mean?

31:49.883 --> 31:51.351
Like, come on, you've been

31:51.351 --> 31:52.853
giving up a lot for others.

31:52.853 --> 31:55.822
I know, I know.

31:55.822 --> 31:56.890
It's really nice to

31:56.890 --> 31:58.625
have the support for the girls.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.634
In almost ten years, this is

32:00.634 --> 32:04.505
the first, like, little tension

32:04.505 --> 32:08.041
we've had, and it scares me.

32:08.041 --> 32:09.309
Best‐dressed

32:09.309 --> 32:10.744
couple alert.

32:10.744 --> 32:13.279
Naomi and Jimmy

32:13.279 --> 32:15.782
Uso!

32:15.782 --> 32:18.484
The true husband and wife duo.

32:18.484 --> 32:19.886
Trin, you and Jon seem

32:19.886 --> 32:21.722
like a match made in

32:21.722 --> 32:23.023
heaven.

32:23.023 --> 32:24.791
Especially when you guys walk

32:24.791 --> 32:26.026
out together in the ring.

32:26.026 --> 32:27.894
Oh, God, I love seeing that.

32:27.894 --> 32:29.896
Oh, you guys are gold, dude.

32:29.896 --> 32:30.697
Okay, I feel better

32:30.697 --> 32:31.497
now.

32:31.497 --> 32:32.232
Yeah.

32:32.232 --> 32:33.166
And you might feel

32:33.166 --> 32:35.168
different the day you and Jon

32:35.168 --> 32:36.269
have a baby together.

32:36.269 --> 32:37.037
Oh, yeah.

32:37.037 --> 32:37.871
'Cause it'll be a

32:37.871 --> 32:38.539
different connection.

32:38.539 --> 32:39.439
I can't wait.

32:39.439 --> 32:41.007
I can't wait to have his kids.

32:41.007 --> 32:41.908
See, you guys, this is

32:41.908 --> 32:43.176
what I think is the plus about

32:43.176 --> 32:44.277
having the journals this week,

32:44.277 --> 32:45.546
is, like, I feel like we'd never

32:45.546 --> 32:46.580
have these conversations...

32:46.580 --> 32:47.614
I agree.

32:47.614 --> 32:48.915
...until we, like, had

32:48.915 --> 32:49.850
the journals and talked about,

32:49.850 --> 32:51.317
like, bringing out our fears and

32:51.317 --> 32:52.819
all this stuff, it, like, brings

32:52.819 --> 32:53.486
us even closer...

32:53.486 --> 32:54.254
It opens you up.

32:54.254 --> 32:54.921
...to talk about

32:54.921 --> 32:55.789
certain things.

32:55.789 --> 32:56.790
And I'm happy we stayed

32:56.790 --> 32:57.624
in and ate pizza...

32:57.624 --> 32:58.291
Me, too.

32:58.291 --> 32:59.059
...instead of going to

32:59.059 --> 32:59.560
a restaurant.

33:06.272 --> 33:06.940
Ready?

33:06.940 --> 33:07.941
I want us to read all

33:07.941 --> 33:09.209
our stuff before the sun goes

33:09.209 --> 33:10.210
down 'cause it just looks too

33:10.210 --> 33:12.679
beautiful.

33:12.679 --> 33:14.815
Okay, you guys, so these things

33:14.815 --> 33:16.550
are healing, purifying and

33:16.550 --> 33:17.851
cleansing little logs.

33:17.851 --> 33:19.119
They're from fallen trees.

33:19.119 --> 33:20.186
It just brings, like, a

33:20.186 --> 33:21.688
spiritual healing and cleansing.

33:21.688 --> 33:23.657
Let your flame burn,

33:23.657 --> 33:24.691
bitches.

33:24.691 --> 33:26.159
The trip is coming to

33:26.159 --> 33:28.762
an end, but I want all of us to

33:28.762 --> 33:30.096
just sit around the campfire and

33:30.096 --> 33:32.365
read our journals.

33:32.365 --> 33:33.299
I didn't even know we

33:33.299 --> 33:34.367
had to read these, by the way.

33:34.367 --> 33:35.201
You don't have to.

33:35.201 --> 33:36.670
No, I'm going to.

33:36.670 --> 33:38.872
I feel like if we read

33:38.872 --> 33:39.873
them out loud, we can just set

33:39.873 --> 33:40.874
them free.

33:40.874 --> 33:42.709
I'm not gonna lie, that I've

33:42.709 --> 33:44.878
never read my poetry for anyone.

33:44.878 --> 33:46.212
Fearless

33:46.212 --> 33:47.147
Nikki.

33:47.147 --> 33:48.314
Doot, doot, doot, doot.

33:48.314 --> 33:49.816
Fearless Nikki.

33:49.816 --> 33:50.951
Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot.

33:51.618 --> 33:52.653
Writing poetry.

33:52.653 --> 33:54.755
Um, all right.

33:54.755 --> 33:55.589
We're proud of you.

33:55.589 --> 33:56.957
Don't start right now.

33:57.624 --> 33:58.625
You can.

33:58.625 --> 33:59.325
"Commitment."

33:59.325 --> 34:00.500
"What is it to be committed?

34:00.500 --> 34:01.968
Is it that your love runs so

34:01.968 --> 34:03.369
deep there's no limit?

34:03.369 --> 34:04.370
Then tell me why

34:04.370 --> 34:05.772
you got so distant.

34:05.772 --> 34:07.340
My love is thicker than water,

34:07.340 --> 34:08.809
but my communication got so

34:08.809 --> 34:10.043
shallow.

34:10.043 --> 34:12.145
Commitment is responsibility.

34:12.145 --> 34:13.746
It's devotion, loyalty and needs

34:13.746 --> 34:14.715
to be given to all your number

34:14.715 --> 34:15.982
ones.

34:15.982 --> 34:17.016
I got a Bird to take care of

34:17.016 --> 34:18.784
that's more special than a dove

34:18.784 --> 34:20.754
and a twin with half my heart

34:20.754 --> 34:22.155
and a family I love tons.

34:22.155 --> 34:23.889
Another family I'm committed to

34:23.889 --> 34:25.291
goes beyond blood.

34:25.291 --> 34:26.693
We punch, slam and hit

34:26.693 --> 34:28.293
and do it all for fun.

34:28.293 --> 34:29.429
They aren't like most girls.

34:29.429 --> 34:31.297
They are my lifeblood.

34:31.297 --> 34:32.799
They're ravishing and gothic and

34:32.799 --> 34:35.501
glow like the sun.

34:35.501 --> 34:37.070
We've become the queen of hearts

34:37.070 --> 34:38.138
the best there are, the best

34:38.138 --> 34:39.105
there was and the best there

34:39.105 --> 34:40.139
ever will be.

34:40.139 --> 34:41.507
It's our faithfulness that has

34:41.507 --> 34:42.676
given us the right parts.

34:42.676 --> 34:44.844
Commitment in all we do will

34:44.844 --> 34:46.146
help us stand and rise,

34:46.146 --> 34:47.748
not fear of fitting in

34:47.748 --> 34:49.882
or think one day our loved one

34:49.882 --> 34:50.917
will say good‐bye.

34:50.917 --> 34:52.985
For now, the mountains in Tahoe

34:52.985 --> 34:53.853
have spoken:

34:53.853 --> 34:55.589
Fly high in my sky, let me heal

34:55.589 --> 34:56.690
all your fears.

34:56.690 --> 34:58.692
Just promise me one thing.

34:58.692 --> 35:00.967
Give me all of your sad tears.

35:00.967 --> 35:03.003
Because tonight around this fire

35:03.003 --> 35:04.304
and under these stars,

35:04.304 --> 35:06.139
a new woman you will be

35:06.139 --> 35:09.109
and all I ask for is that you'll

35:09.109 --> 35:11.377
never forget me."

35:12.045 --> 35:12.779
Oh, my God.

35:12.779 --> 35:13.847
Holy.

35:13.847 --> 35:14.748
That was amazing.

35:14.748 --> 35:15.716
Oh, my God.

35:15.716 --> 35:17.383
That was so good.

35:17.383 --> 35:18.552
Thank you so much.

35:18.552 --> 35:19.219
Unbelievable.

35:19.219 --> 35:19.986
That was beautiful.

35:19.986 --> 35:20.987
I love you all.

35:20.987 --> 35:22.723
Yeah, that's crazy.

35:22.723 --> 35:23.557
You should've went

35:23.557 --> 35:24.224
last.

35:24.224 --> 35:25.325
I've just been through

35:25.325 --> 35:26.827
a lot this past year, and all

35:26.827 --> 35:27.928
the girls around me have been

35:27.928 --> 35:29.329
through a lot, and to share that

35:29.329 --> 35:30.597
with them, I just truly feel

35:30.597 --> 35:31.632
like I've grown.

35:31.632 --> 35:33.366
It's been a tough one, but it's

35:33.366 --> 35:35.969
nice to get that, get it out in

35:35.969 --> 35:37.170
the open and just let the flames

35:37.170 --> 35:39.005
take it all the way up.

35:39.005 --> 35:40.574
You just, like, summed

35:40.574 --> 35:41.542
up our whole trip.

35:41.542 --> 35:42.408
That was perfect for

35:42.408 --> 35:43.476
everybody.

35:43.476 --> 35:44.377
I'm a mess right

35:44.377 --> 35:45.612
now.

35:45.612 --> 35:46.279
Oh,!

35:46.279 --> 35:47.180
Stick a plug in her.

35:47.180 --> 35:47.848
I'm sorry.

35:47.848 --> 35:48.882
No, let it flow, baby

35:48.882 --> 35:49.550
girl.

35:49.550 --> 35:50.283
Let it flow.

35:50.283 --> 35:50.984
That was beautiful.

35:50.984 --> 35:51.818
That was so good.

35:51.818 --> 35:52.719
All right, ,

35:52.719 --> 35:53.386
okay.

35:53.386 --> 35:54.220
The cover of Paige's

35:54.220 --> 35:55.822
book says " off."

35:55.822 --> 35:56.657
So this is Paige's

35:56.657 --> 35:57.791
diary, " off."

35:59.560 --> 36:01.702
"Day one, Tahoe: nailed it."

36:03.269 --> 36:04.838
"Nicole stole our phones.

36:04.838 --> 36:07.440
Eye roll, heart break.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.374
Lana and I nearly started a

36:08.374 --> 36:09.275
fight club.

36:09.275 --> 36:10.677
Headed to bed at 9:30.

36:10.677 --> 36:11.978
When the did I lose it?"

36:15.816 --> 36:16.717
Uh, "Opened up to the girls

36:16.717 --> 36:17.984
today about one of my fears.

36:17.984 --> 36:19.620
Yes, I'm... I don't know how to

36:19.620 --> 36:20.621
swim.

36:20.621 --> 36:22.022
But it's also the fact that I

36:22.022 --> 36:23.456
don't like deep water.

36:23.456 --> 36:24.825
But the tubing really helped and

36:24.825 --> 36:25.792
I really appreciate Nikki for

36:25.792 --> 36:27.260
encouraging me to go faster,

36:27.260 --> 36:28.294
even though I wanted to punch

36:28.294 --> 36:29.062
her in the face."

36:29.730 --> 36:30.664
"We need to try and overcome

36:30.664 --> 36:31.832
these fears together.

36:31.832 --> 36:33.099
Great bonding experience."

36:33.099 --> 36:33.800
That was it.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.935
I loved it.

36:34.935 --> 36:36.202
That was so good.

36:36.202 --> 36:37.137
So you have to read

36:37.137 --> 36:37.638
your journal.

36:37.638 --> 36:38.304
Ah, crap.

36:38.304 --> 36:39.105
Come on, Nia Jax.

36:39.105 --> 36:40.406
Yes.

36:40.406 --> 36:41.407
"So far, I can't say

36:41.407 --> 36:42.709
enough incredible things about

36:42.709 --> 36:43.409
this trip.

36:43.409 --> 36:44.578
Each woman has taught me

36:44.578 --> 36:45.612
something this weekend.

36:45.612 --> 36:47.714
Paige, her unconditional love

36:47.714 --> 36:49.516
and perseverance; Nattie, her

36:49.516 --> 36:52.485
strength and patience; Trinity,

36:52.485 --> 36:53.854
she quietly works her butt off

36:53.854 --> 36:55.221
in athletics, families,

36:55.221 --> 36:56.289
friendships and she brings a

36:56.289 --> 36:57.390
happy and positive energy

36:57.390 --> 37:00.026
everywhere; Lana, Lana proved to

37:00.026 --> 37:01.034
me that no matter how many times

37:01.034 --> 37:02.201
you are told no, you can always

37:02.201 --> 37:03.302
find a way to get something‐‐ or

37:03.302 --> 37:04.070
someone‐‐ to change their

37:04.070 --> 37:04.571
mind..."

37:05.238 --> 37:06.806
Oh, I love it.

37:06.806 --> 37:08.074
"Nicole, the definition

37:08.074 --> 37:09.342
of fearless..."

37:09.342 --> 37:11.310
Hmm. right.

37:11.310 --> 37:12.078
"Brianna..."

37:12.078 --> 37:12.746
Oh...

37:12.746 --> 37:14.080
"...devoted, genuine and

37:14.080 --> 37:14.881
compassion."

37:14.881 --> 37:15.381
Aww...

37:15.381 --> 37:16.049
"All these beautiful

37:16.049 --> 37:18.417
women empower me to be a better

37:18.417 --> 37:19.319
human."

37:19.319 --> 37:20.386
Oh, my God.

37:20.386 --> 37:21.121
Wow.

37:21.121 --> 37:22.756
Nia.

37:22.756 --> 37:23.824
Oh, that was so good.

37:23.824 --> 37:24.958
I'm just, I'm very

37:24.958 --> 37:27.728
grateful and I'm blessed and I

37:27.728 --> 37:28.729
need to learn to appreciate

37:28.729 --> 37:30.597
these moments and appreciate the

37:30.597 --> 37:32.533
life that I'm living and, you

37:32.533 --> 37:33.634
know, I need to enjoy every

37:33.634 --> 37:35.235
moment, because I do work hard

37:35.235 --> 37:37.804
and I do deserve things like

37:37.804 --> 37:38.572
this.

37:38.572 --> 37:40.206
That's something to feel proud

37:40.206 --> 37:41.608
of, and not guilty of.

37:41.608 --> 37:42.643
All right, Lana.

37:42.643 --> 37:43.309
Okay, Lana.

37:43.309 --> 37:43.977
We want to hear...

37:43.977 --> 37:45.145
Drop it on us, sister.

37:45.812 --> 37:46.547
Speak from your heart.

37:46.547 --> 37:47.413
Um...

37:48.281 --> 37:49.149
I'm gonna end up getting...

37:49.149 --> 37:49.916
That's okay.

37:49.916 --> 37:50.751
I get emotional.

37:53.219 --> 37:55.288
Um, "Through this couple days,

37:55.288 --> 37:56.456
I've really realized...

37:58.158 --> 37:59.059
...how much words have so much

37:59.059 --> 37:59.826
power.

37:59.826 --> 38:01.134
We can either build each other

38:01.134 --> 38:02.936
up or we can tear each other

38:02.936 --> 38:05.506
down, with just one sentence."

38:05.506 --> 38:06.406
This is why I never

38:06.406 --> 38:07.508
liked you, Lana.

38:07.508 --> 38:08.709
Don't come anywhere

38:08.709 --> 38:09.743
near me this whole trip.

38:09.743 --> 38:11.411
"And I've realized,

38:11.411 --> 38:13.514
through the things that I've

38:13.514 --> 38:16.717
gone with, with Paige this week,

38:16.717 --> 38:19.152
sometimes an apology will never

38:19.152 --> 38:21.822
heal the damage that has been

38:21.822 --> 38:23.289
done.

38:34.535 --> 38:35.335
"Sometimes an apology

38:35.335 --> 38:38.371
will never heal the damage that

38:38.371 --> 38:39.640
has been done.

38:39.640 --> 38:42.576
And I've realized I want to

38:42.576 --> 38:45.045
control my words and I want to

38:45.045 --> 38:49.115
leave a‐a legacy of love and

38:49.115 --> 38:51.685
forgiveness.

38:51.685 --> 38:54.888
I want love to lead because love

38:54.888 --> 38:58.592
conquers all."

38:59.660 --> 39:03.069
"And forgiveness is truly

39:03.069 --> 39:05.606
forgiving and forgetting and

39:05.606 --> 39:08.174
genuinely giving that person a

39:08.174 --> 39:10.744
second, third and as many

39:10.744 --> 39:13.013
chances that they need, because

39:13.013 --> 39:16.116
I want people to forgive me."

39:16.116 --> 39:16.950
Amen, sister.

39:16.950 --> 39:18.418
That was really good.

39:18.418 --> 39:20.954
That's beautiful.

39:20.954 --> 39:21.622
Need therapy after

39:21.622 --> 39:22.288
this.

39:22.288 --> 39:23.223
I feel like this is

39:23.223 --> 39:24.157
therapy, though.

39:24.157 --> 39:24.958
I very much agree,

39:24.958 --> 39:25.626
Trin.

39:25.626 --> 39:26.392
I think that's

39:26.392 --> 39:29.362
beautiful, Lana.

39:29.362 --> 39:31.698
Tahoe has been... very

39:31.698 --> 39:34.367
emotional experience.

39:34.367 --> 39:36.369
What is life if we live in fear?

39:36.369 --> 39:38.271
We can only hurt ourselves by

39:38.271 --> 39:41.074
living in fear, and we as women

39:41.074 --> 39:42.075
have decided to hold each

39:42.075 --> 39:43.710
others' hands and, together, run

39:43.710 --> 39:46.012
into our fears, and I'm so

39:46.012 --> 39:46.680
grateful for that.

39:46.680 --> 39:47.548
It's crazy how we're

39:47.548 --> 39:48.348
all fighting some kind of

39:48.348 --> 39:49.015
battle, you know?

39:49.015 --> 39:49.683
It is.

39:49.683 --> 39:50.350
And no one...

39:50.350 --> 39:51.217
You just never know

39:51.217 --> 39:52.052
when someone's going through

39:52.052 --> 39:52.719
something.

39:52.719 --> 39:54.320
I love you guys.

40:03.236 --> 40:04.237
Trin came up with the

40:04.237 --> 40:05.005
best joke.

40:05.005 --> 40:06.507
Nikki swallows.

40:06.507 --> 40:07.741
Nikki swallows.

40:07.741 --> 40:09.375
Nikki swallows.

40:09.375 --> 40:10.376
I am single right now,

40:10.376 --> 40:10.877
and...

40:10.877 --> 40:11.578
Ready to mingle.

40:11.578 --> 40:12.078
I...

40:12.078 --> 40:12.813
Let's get pregnant

40:12.813 --> 40:13.647
together.

40:13.647 --> 40:14.881
She wants us to get

40:14.881 --> 40:15.682
pregnant together so bad.

40:15.682 --> 40:16.349
Why not?

40:16.349 --> 40:17.050
That would be

40:17.050 --> 40:17.718
awesome.

40:17.718 --> 40:19.252
Only if we have boys.

40:19.252 --> 40:19.953
Oh, okay.

40:19.953 --> 40:20.787
Let's all make a

40:20.787 --> 40:21.588
pregnancy pact.

40:21.588 --> 40:22.422
You‐‐ what does Us‐‐

40:22.422 --> 40:23.924
but what does Us say?

40:23.924 --> 40:25.592
Nah, he wants one

40:25.592 --> 40:26.326
right now.

40:26.326 --> 40:28.729
And I always told him, by 30, I

40:28.729 --> 40:29.896
would give him a baby, and,

40:29.896 --> 40:31.064
like, 30 came and I was, like,

40:31.064 --> 40:31.565
"Oh."

40:31.565 --> 40:32.432
Oh,.

40:32.432 --> 40:33.233
That came quick.

40:33.233 --> 40:34.367
But I want to knock them out

40:34.367 --> 40:36.236
like boom, boom, boom, like, it

40:36.236 --> 40:38.271
got to be done by, like, 35, 36.

40:38.271 --> 40:39.272
I want to do two,

40:39.272 --> 40:40.641
like, super quick, back‐to‐back.

40:40.641 --> 40:41.542
Oh, God, I feel like

40:41.542 --> 40:42.543
I'm gonna have a baby at some

40:42.543 --> 40:43.243
point.

40:43.243 --> 40:44.144
You want a baby now?

40:44.144 --> 40:44.878
Really, baby G?

40:44.878 --> 40:45.879
What?

40:48.582 --> 40:50.050
Wait, what?

40:50.050 --> 40:51.484
Nattie!

40:51.484 --> 40:52.986
Nattie! Nattie!

40:52.986 --> 40:53.887
No, I just feel like

40:53.887 --> 40:55.355
Birdie makes my heart melt.

40:55.355 --> 40:56.489
Nattie!

40:56.489 --> 40:57.290
Nattie!

40:57.290 --> 40:58.058
You guys, let's head

40:58.058 --> 40:58.725
out.

40:58.725 --> 41:01.501
Thank you.

41:01.501 --> 41:02.536
We're jumping in that lake.

41:02.536 --> 41:03.403
Yes.

41:03.403 --> 41:04.070
We are.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.338
We are refreshening

41:05.338 --> 41:06.006
our souls.

41:06.006 --> 41:06.973
Guess what?

41:06.973 --> 41:08.875
stoked.

41:08.875 --> 41:09.676
We're jumping in the

41:09.676 --> 41:10.343

hand, Nia!

41:14.280 --> 41:15.415

41:15.415 --> 41:16.583
Oh, my God, you are not drowning

41:16.583 --> 41:18.619
on my watch.

41:18.619 --> 41:19.452
Wait, I can't swim.

41:19.452 --> 41:21.387
I'm wearing a life jacket.

41:21.387 --> 41:22.055
Got it.

41:22.055 --> 41:23.790
Slap me, slap me.

Jumping into this

cleanses your soul, you know?

it is right now.

42:16.049 --> 42:16.883
You have to admit,

42:16.883 --> 42:18.118
jumping in like that was

42:18.118 --> 42:18.985
magical.

42:18.985 --> 42:20.220
It was so nice.

42:20.220 --> 42:21.822
I'm taking away this sisterhood

42:21.822 --> 42:23.356
that we built on this trip, the

42:23.356 --> 42:25.225
bonds that we created, the love

42:25.225 --> 42:27.493
that we all shared and I hope

42:27.493 --> 42:30.564
this brings, like, amazingness

42:34.234 --> 42:35.068
I almost just ran

42:35.068 --> 42:37.337
through the screen.

42:41.274 --> 42:42.442
This trip has been the

42:42.442 --> 42:44.511
best girls trip I have ever

42:44.511 --> 42:46.179
taken in my life.

42:46.179 --> 42:48.048
I've never felt, in such a short

42:48.048 --> 42:49.349
amount of time, that I've become

42:49.349 --> 42:50.383
closer with these women.

42:50.383 --> 42:51.552
I can't even explain the

42:51.552 --> 42:52.452
feeling.

42:52.452 --> 42:53.920
I don't know if it's Lake Tahoe,

42:53.920 --> 42:55.488
the women I'm surrounded by or

42:55.488 --> 42:56.657
the fact that we accomplished

42:56.657 --> 42:58.191
conquering our fears, but this

42:58.191 --> 43:00.033
trip will stand out as

43:00.033 --> 43:00.901
number one.

43:00.901 --> 43:01.902
How do we fight and

43:01.902 --> 43:02.969
literally want to kill each

43:02.969 --> 43:04.404
other one second, and then the

43:04.404 --> 43:05.138
next second...

43:07.340 --> 43:08.675
I love you guys.

43:08.675 --> 43:10.944
I love you!

high‐stakes match.

43:17.818 --> 43:19.520

43:19.520 --> 43:20.186

43:24.057 --> 43:24.891
Wow!

43:24.891 --> 43:25.892
My wedding ring was

43:25.892 --> 43:26.527
stolen.

43:26.527 --> 43:27.528
I always told you to

43:27.528 --> 43:28.028
wear it.

43:28.028 --> 43:28.762
You never wore it.

43:28.762 --> 43:29.663
I just thought my dad

43:29.663 --> 43:31.364
was gonna live forever.

43:31.364 --> 43:33.066
It's just hard to know how to

43:33.066 --> 43:35.068
say good‐bye.

43:35.068 --> 43:36.970
I need to get it together.
