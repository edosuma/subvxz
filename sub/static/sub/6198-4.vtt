<i>Naturally, a bookworm like you

02:32.340 --> 02:34.980
<i>It must be a killer song!</i>

02:35.840 --> 02:39.650
<i>The song "Reborn" is getting
a lot of buzz on social media.</i>

02:39.680 --> 02:43.700
<i>It has aroused a huge backlash,

suicide,</i>

02:46.820 --> 02:51.400
<i>or if the lyrics are encouraging
suicide is unclear at this time.</i>

02:51.450 --> 02:58.740
<i>There is a lot of attention on the

will be holding a press conference.</i>

02:58.740 --> 03:00.940
<i>Awesome! I just heard the news.</i>

05:08.930 --> 05:10.510
I didn't expect you here!

05:17.020 --> 05:18.650
What's that stuff?

05:18.700 --> 05:22.250
I boiled some organic herbs that
are supposed to relieve stress.

05:22.270 --> 05:23.720
Would you like to try it?

05:31.850 --> 05:34.250
No thanks. You should drink it.

05:34.350 --> 05:36.640
Do you go riding every morning?

05:36.660 --> 05:37.790
I'm going to work.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.850
You ride all the way to
the office?

05:39.870 --> 05:44.270
Lately, my endurance has been
down, so I decided to start
exercising as of today.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.700
What do you think?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.580
I heard this blocks wind
resistance.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.040
Isn't it awfully tiring?

05:49.070 --> 05:50.460
How far have you gone?

05:50.470 --> 05:53.450
Don't look at me like that.
I'm very muscular.

05:54.010 --> 05:57.490
If I get tired, I can just
catch a taxi.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.450
I'm going to be late.
I should be going.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.830
See you later.

06:18.510 --> 06:21.410
<i>Songpo-dong 673-3, Paju,
Gyeonggi-do.</i>

06:21.480 --> 06:28.380
<i>After Yun Tae Jin left prison on
the 12th, it was the last place
his phone signal occurred.</i>

06:56.650 --> 06:59.210
A busy director still has time
to give me a call?

06:59.240 --> 07:01.050
Let me take over the case.

07:01.050 --> 07:03.250
You gave me full authority!

07:03.880 --> 07:07.290
The reason I set the team up
outside the police department...

07:10.000 --> 07:12.060
is to keep our investigations
confidential.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.180
Well, then...

07:15.560 --> 07:17.930
let's talk about that later.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.040
I really can't do it?

07:43.260 --> 07:45.090
Success! Success!

07:48.760 --> 07:50.230
That's disgusting!

07:52.800 --> 07:55.000
How can you just stick it
in there?

07:58.670 --> 07:59.780
So disgusting.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.240
It's sad.

08:01.240 --> 08:05.280
These guys have zero concept
of hygiene! Zero!

08:08.580 --> 08:11.890
Yun Se-A's "Reborn", the South
Korean version of "Gloomy Sunday."

08:11.890 --> 08:14.820
Ten people have committed
suicide after listening to this song.

08:14.820 --> 08:16.120
<i>Good morning.</i>

08:17.100 --> 08:22.530
This song must be weird, or else
the suicidal people are weird.

08:23.630 --> 08:26.200
<i>But, isn't Yun Se-A an actor?</i>

08:26.570 --> 08:27.670
Really?

08:28.770 --> 08:30.970
Hey, punk, you don't know
anything.

08:30.970 --> 08:34.280
She doesn't sing as much lately,
but she sang a lot of popular songs,

08:34.280 --> 08:36.110
and she writes them herself.

08:36.110 --> 08:37.210
<i>Also,</i>

08:37.340 --> 08:41.250
since we're talking about that,
what could a song do anyway?

08:41.370 --> 08:44.920
People who commit suicide after
hearing a sad song have problems,

08:44.920 --> 08:46.020
don't you agree?

08:46.450 --> 08:49.320
Detective Lee, are you Yun Se-A's
spokesman?

08:49.330 --> 08:53.730
Then, do you think a song could
cast a commit suicide spell?

08:53.870 --> 08:55.930
That would be some song.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.400
Have you heard it?

08:57.400 --> 09:02.540
What if you heard the song and
really wanted to kill yourself?

09:02.540 --> 09:07.310
If the lyrics and melody were
the saddest ever,

09:07.840 --> 09:11.350
and reached the sadness deep
in my soul,

09:11.350 --> 09:17.220
if those sad feelings were touched
by the voice and melody of
Yun Se-A,

09:17.220 --> 09:20.160
and then the flavor of the song
would just...

09:21.260 --> 09:23.830
How could I explain it?

09:24.930 --> 09:26.390
Detective Han,

09:26.390 --> 09:28.960
can you put on that "Reborn"
song?

09:29.220 --> 09:33.000
I wanted to hear it too, but the
streaming service was frozen.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.670
That is Yun Se-A's power!

09:37.770 --> 09:38.870
Really?

09:38.940 --> 09:41.440
So now they want to hear it.

09:41.490 --> 09:46.580
People committing suicide after
hearing a song is not a new
phenomenon.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.120
Loyalty.

09:48.260 --> 09:51.350
Wow. What is she dressed as?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.260
After listening to the song,

10:01.260 --> 10:04.570
the highest suicide rate is among
3rd year high school students,

10:04.570 --> 10:05.670
until graduation.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.870
People who already have
depression.

10:07.870 --> 10:10.810
After the first person committed
suicide,

10:10.940 --> 10:13.740
the rumor linking that song to
suicide started.

10:13.740 --> 10:16.680
It's not the song itself that
triggers suicide.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.250
But for a person in a dangerous
emotional state,

10:19.250 --> 10:22.550
it can indirectly affect the
suicidal feelings of that person.

10:22.550 --> 10:24.390
I knew this eonni was smart.

10:26.590 --> 10:28.790
These guys...

10:31.360 --> 10:32.460
Attention.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.560
You've worked hard.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.660
Loyalty.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.130
I brought you a case.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.170
Yun Se-A is missing?

10:40.170 --> 10:43.470
According to her boyfriend, she
was on her way to a press
conference.

10:43.470 --> 10:46.410
She disappeared at her
front door.

10:46.410 --> 10:51.550
Could she have changed her mind
about facing the reporters and
just didn't go?

10:57.420 --> 10:58.890
<i>Se-A.</i>

10:59.620 --> 11:03.290
After her song came out and
people started committing suicide,

11:03.290 --> 11:05.130
she was suffering.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.900
She felt like she was morally
responsible for all of it.

11:12.830 --> 11:16.140
Did the two of you quarrel
last night?

11:24.580 --> 11:26.410
What happened?

11:28.250 --> 11:31.190
She drank too much and got
really drunk.

11:31.550 --> 11:33.390
We had a few angry words.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.790
Only a few angry words and you
break a wineglass over it?

11:38.160 --> 11:40.730
That's suspicious.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.300
But right afterward, we reconciled.

11:44.030 --> 11:46.970
Oh, you found her phone
downstairs, right?

11:53.210 --> 11:55.040
<i>I'm sorry about last night.</i>

11:55.040 --> 11:57.250
<i>Don't be too nervous in front of
the reporters.</i>

11:59.810 --> 12:02.750
<i>Don't worry. I'm fine.</i>

12:06.790 --> 12:08.260
<i>Yes?</i>

12:08.260 --> 12:09.720
<i>I'm leaving now.</i>

12:12.660 --> 12:14.500
<i>I have to go.</i>

12:17.070 --> 12:21.840
<i>She left for the press conference,
but then her manager called.</i>

12:22.570 --> 12:26.240
<i>He'd been waiting in the parking
garage 10 minutes, but she wasn't
there yet. </i>

12:26.610 --> 12:29.180
<i>I went out to see what had
happened.</i>

12:29.910 --> 12:33.950
I didn't expect to find Se-A's
phone just downstairs.

12:33.950 --> 12:37.990
So, Yun Se-A's phone was
dropped out here, is that right?

12:37.990 --> 12:41.290
When we both came out here to
look for her, that's when we
found it.

12:42.390 --> 12:43.490
Nothing will happen to her, will it?

12:43.570 --> 12:45.190
Of course not.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.360
Why does something happen
before they replace CCTV
equipment?

12:50.310 --> 12:51.490
Seonbaenim.

12:52.550 --> 12:53.870
Black box.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.010
The place her phone was dropped
was next to a parked car.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.840
So we applied for a black box
warrant.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.940
Okay, good job.

13:02.940 --> 13:03.680
Detective Jeong,

13:04.050 --> 13:06.980
does anything smell suspicious?

13:11.020 --> 13:12.490
What have you been doing?

13:12.490 --> 13:15.420
As her manager, you should
have been right by her side!

13:15.420 --> 13:16.520
I'm sorry.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.360
President, please calm down.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.830
That's enough.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.600
Who the heck are you?

13:25.330 --> 13:26.800
Police.

13:29.740 --> 13:34.140
Please, you must not let the
outside world know about this.

13:34.510 --> 13:39.650
We told the reporters Se-A isn't
feeling well and needs to rest.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.120
Goodbye.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.580
Wait a moment.

13:43.690 --> 13:48.090
What was Yun Se-A planning to
say at the press conference?

13:49.920 --> 13:52.130
Do you need to ask that?

13:52.860 --> 13:55.430
That there is no relationship
between the song and suicide.

13:55.430 --> 13:57.630
That it was absolutely not
intentional.

13:57.630 --> 14:01.670
To express deep sorrow for the
bereaved families.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.510
Stuff like that.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.810
<i>Let's go.</i>

14:20.760 --> 14:22.220
Detective.

14:22.220 --> 14:25.530
You must find Se-A.
I'm counting on you.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.830
Of course.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.130
Doesn't that guy seem
suspicious?

14:32.130 --> 14:33.600
There have been stories in
the news,

14:33.970 --> 14:38.370
Yun Se-A and a rich 2nd Generation
were dating, but his family
seriously opposed it.

14:38.740 --> 14:42.040
Maybe they fought about it last
night and then accidentally...

14:42.040 --> 14:43.880
Quit writing a novel.

15:01.130 --> 15:04.430
Do you know the last time
Yun Se-A used her own car?

15:04.800 --> 15:06.630
It hasn't been used for a while.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.100
After the song came out,

15:08.470 --> 15:10.670
she didn't go out of the house
for a whole week.

15:11.770 --> 15:13.240
May I look at the navigation?

15:13.610 --> 15:15.080
I'll go and get the key.

15:16.910 --> 15:18.380
What's wrong?

15:19.480 --> 15:23.520
If she hasn't used the car for a
while, why do you want to see
the navigation?

15:23.520 --> 15:24.990
The day before yesterday,
it rained in the morning.

15:25.350 --> 15:28.660
Did she drive out before dawn
without her boyfriend knowing?

15:32.330 --> 15:33.800
It's Yun Se-A.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.630
I guess it really is.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.830
It's Yun Se-A.

15:39.670 --> 15:44.440
This suspect waited until she got
into this small area before he
abducted Yun Se-A.

15:52.510 --> 15:53.980
That guy is really bold.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.230
What about a ransom call?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.230
There hasn't been one yet.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.120
I checked the license plate, and
it was reported as a stolen vehicle.

15:59.150 --> 16:00.710
He's a very careful person.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.380
Go to Road Management and
track the location of the vehicle.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.630
Let's go.

16:09.460 --> 16:10.870
Play it again.

16:10.870 --> 16:11.610
Okay.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.240
Detective Lee.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.570
No. 53.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.180
Okay.

16:27.750 --> 16:31.790
Detective Jeong, take a look at
No. 53 in Seocho-gu.

16:32.150 --> 16:33.250
Okay.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.430
Zoom in.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.630
That's the suspect's vehicle, right?

16:50.140 --> 16:52.340
<i>His name is Jo Jin Su, age 38.</i>

16:52.710 --> 16:57.480
<i>Because he's a stalker fan of
Yun Se-A, he was previously
investigated 4 years ago.</i>

16:59.680 --> 17:01.150
I think he's inside.

17:01.150 --> 17:04.819
First, let's get him to come out
and then arrest him.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.760
At times like this, being a ghost
is convenient.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.589
I'll go in and take a look.

17:22.069 --> 17:23.540
Ajussi!

17:26.470 --> 17:27.579
Hey!

17:41.890 --> 17:44.830
<i>From appearances, cause of
death is excessive blood loss.</i>

17:45.190 --> 17:47.030
An unusual weapon was used.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.960
I'd say it was a knife,
rather narrow and long,

17:49.960 --> 17:51.800
but not very sharp.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.640
It's the first time I've seen
such a weapon.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.200
More specifically,

17:56.570 --> 17:59.140
his chest and abdomen were
stabbed 8 times,

17:59.510 --> 18:00.980
but there are no defensive
wounds.

18:01.340 --> 18:02.080
Absolutely none.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.280
No defensive wounds...

18:04.280 --> 18:08.680
If he was passed out drunk,
couldn't that be why he didn't
resist?

18:08.680 --> 18:10.890
It's possible he was drunk.

18:10.890 --> 18:15.290
Anyway, the details will have to
wait for the autopsy results.

18:17.130 --> 18:21.160
I may be a ghost, but I can't
stand this nasty disgusting stuff.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.710
See? She and I communicate well.

18:34.740 --> 18:35.840
Detective Han.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.670
Before Yun Se-A debuted, she
used to live at the dorm here.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.880
What would she be doing here?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.340
To reclaim her determination,

19:10.340 --> 19:11.810
is that what you mean?

20:25.590 --> 20:27.050
It's the Yun Se-A song.

20:27.420 --> 20:28.890
"Reborn"?

20:53.110 --> 20:54.580
It's impossible.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.590
<i>What happened just now, </i>

21:34.960 --> 21:37.160
<i>that was a "dead sign", right?</i>

21:39.360 --> 21:41.930
<i>Otherwise, there's no rational
explanation.</i>

21:41.930 --> 21:44.130
<i>Who is that woman?</i>

21:44.500 --> 21:46.700
<i>Is she related to Yun Se-A?</i>

21:47.800 --> 21:49.640
Quit playing around.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.470
You were really scared, right?

21:52.940 --> 21:54.040
Fine.

21:54.410 --> 21:56.240
Where do you want to investigate
now?

21:58.450 --> 22:00.650
You're not chasing after
your idols lately?

22:01.020 --> 22:03.870
My oppas are done promoting
their album.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.150
Besides, it's more interesting
here.

22:06.270 --> 22:07.620
A lot more exciting.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.820
There are things I can do.

22:11.290 --> 22:14.960
Truthfully, you just want to
possess a body, right?

22:14.960 --> 22:16.800
What do you take me for?

22:17.160 --> 22:19.730
To be blunt, even in a body,
was I ever idle?

22:19.730 --> 22:21.200
I wasn't idle!

22:21.200 --> 22:23.770
I was always working on a case.

22:27.070 --> 22:29.280
See? You have nothing to say,
right?

22:29.280 --> 22:30.380
Accept it!

22:30.380 --> 22:32.580
That last case, if not for me...

22:34.050 --> 22:36.250
Have the autopsy results come
out yet?

22:36.620 --> 22:37.720
Not yet.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.660
This guy who took Yun Se-A,
what's going on?

22:40.660 --> 22:42.490
We don't have a decent clue.

22:43.220 --> 22:46.160
<i>The crime scene forensic team
results have come out.</i>

22:46.160 --> 22:50.200
They didn't find any clues
regarding who killed Jo Jin Su.

22:50.930 --> 22:52.770
Aigoo. This is really a tough one.

22:53.130 --> 22:54.240
Hey.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.800
Don't you all think there was
probably an accomplice?

22:56.800 --> 22:59.370
In Jo Jin Su's death, also.

22:59.370 --> 23:00.280
Don't you think so?

23:00.320 --> 23:01.530
Could it...

23:01.940 --> 23:05.980
possibly be related to the
previous suicides?

23:05.980 --> 23:09.280
You, kid. This is something
important and you bring that up?

23:09.450 --> 23:12.350
I mean, a family member of
one of them,

23:12.450 --> 23:15.160
might be very angry.

23:16.260 --> 23:19.560
The internet was saying that
Yun Se-A is cursed.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.240
What is it about a curse?

23:23.200 --> 23:26.530
<i>What it says here, is it true?</i>

23:26.900 --> 23:31.670
Every time Yun Se-A appears in
a show, something happens.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.980
Although it's a bit exaggerated,
basically everything is true.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.550
Yun Se-A,

23:38.650 --> 23:42.680
since her debut, she has released
2 solo albums every year.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.780
But for the last 6 years,

23:44.150 --> 23:45.990
every time she has released a
solo album,

23:45.990 --> 23:47.820
she has had problems.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.390
On a music program, the lights
shattered.

23:50.390 --> 23:52.960
<i>At a concert 2 years ago,
the stage collapsed.</i>

23:52.960 --> 23:57.000
<i>Anyway, it seems there are
problems every time she releases
an album. </i>

23:57.000 --> 24:00.300
I guess that's why people say
that Yun Se-A is cursed.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.340
But still, saying that stuff doesn't
make any sense!

24:02.500 --> 24:04.000
That's mysterious.

24:04.130 --> 24:06.170
Could she really be cursed?

24:06.990 --> 24:09.110
I've also heard something
like that.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.310
Was it her last album?

24:12.050 --> 24:13.880
I heard a ghost appeared in
her music video.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.080
Look, there really is someone!

24:16.080 --> 24:20.120
People said it was a ghost,

24:20.120 --> 24:21.960
but how does that make sense?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.420
<i>It's just special effects, right?</i>

24:23.790 --> 24:25.990
<i>What else could it be?</i>

24:25.990 --> 24:28.560
<i>Lately, it's "Noise Marketing."</i>

24:33.700 --> 24:35.900
It's that woman!

24:35.900 --> 24:37.370
Isn't it?

24:37.740 --> 24:41.040
Is this woman connected to
Yun Se-A?

24:44.710 --> 24:46.910
The autopsy results are out.

24:54.990 --> 24:57.930
The kidnapper... is dead?

25:00.490 --> 25:01.960
Then Se-A?

25:01.960 --> 25:03.060
What about Se-A?

25:03.060 --> 25:05.630
We suspect he had an accomplice.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.100
Was there...

25:07.470 --> 25:11.140
anyone who had a grudge
against Yun Se-A?

25:11.140 --> 25:12.240
<i>Anyone who seems suspicious?</i>

25:12.610 --> 25:15.180
Or someone she might have
quarreled with recently?

25:15.180 --> 25:18.110
Even if it's something small,
you should tell us.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.780
<i>That was my choice to make,
not yours!</i>

25:21.780 --> 25:23.980
<i>Can't you just let me go now?</i>

25:24.350 --> 25:27.290
<i>How long do I have to be
controlled by you?</i>

25:29.120 --> 25:30.590
<i>About her contract renewal,</i>

25:30.960 --> 25:33.530
she didn't get along well with
the company president.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.570
<i>Contract renewal.</i>

25:51.150 --> 25:52.980
Look at that.

25:52.980 --> 25:55.920
Do you know this person?
He's Jo Jin Su.

25:56.650 --> 26:00.320
He's a known stalker of Se-A who
has been investigated before.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.520
This is the jerk who kidnapped
her, right?

26:02.890 --> 26:03.990
Has he been caught?

26:04.360 --> 26:08.030
Yesterday, we found him
murdered in his home.

26:08.030 --> 26:09.500
<i>Murdered?</i>

26:09.500 --> 26:10.600
What about Se-A?

26:10.970 --> 26:16.470
The exact reason why Jo Jin Su
kidnapped Yun Se-A is still unclear,

26:16.840 --> 26:21.240
but we believe that Jo Jin Su
must have had an accomplice.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.080
An accomplice?

26:33.350 --> 26:38.130
We heard your contract with
Yun Se-A was about to expire.

26:38.130 --> 26:43.260
Negotiations to renew the
contract were going very well.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.470
That's not what her boyfriend
said.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.040
Didn't the two of you argue?

27:00.880 --> 27:04.550
-=President's Office=-

27:15.930 --> 27:17.030
Who was it?

27:17.770 --> 27:19.600
There's definitely a problem.

27:22.540 --> 27:25.470
Should I do some undercover
investigating?

27:28.410 --> 27:31.710
That President is really suspicious.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.910
This has to involve the contract
renewal.

27:34.280 --> 27:37.590
But the motivation is not enough,
not enough.

27:38.320 --> 27:42.720
Agencies negotiating contract
renewals with their artists is a
common thing.

27:43.090 --> 27:44.560
<i>The other things are another
matter.</i>

27:44.930 --> 27:46.030
Really, kid.

27:46.030 --> 27:48.960
Why do you think he would
kidnap Yun Se-A?

27:48.960 --> 27:50.060
Money?

27:50.060 --> 27:52.270
You're not even trying.

27:52.270 --> 27:54.100
There's no one to get money
from.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.670
Then why do you think he
would kidnap her?

27:59.240 --> 28:01.080
After thinking it over,

28:01.080 --> 28:05.850
this is one of the three, sexual
desire, lust, or infatuation.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.780
But someone who is excessively
careful,

28:08.780 --> 28:11.720
since after making use of Jo Jin
Su, he then killed him.

28:12.450 --> 28:14.290
That doesn't seem very careful.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.760
You're back?

28:17.220 --> 28:22.360
If he were very careful, would
he have left Jo Jin Su's body
in the house?

28:23.460 --> 28:24.930
What did you find out about
the agency?

28:25.040 --> 28:28.570
We need to investigate President
Yu and Secretary Do further.

28:28.770 --> 28:31.750
It just seems they're a little
suspicious.

28:32.790 --> 28:34.480
Right.

28:50.380 --> 28:54.290
Wow. This movie has exactly
the same story!

28:54.620 --> 28:57.970
Incredible! What will the ending
be like in real life?

28:57.970 --> 28:59.800
Will Yun Se-A die at the
kidnapper's hands?

28:59.800 --> 29:03.840
Aigoo. Here comes the curse
once again.

29:04.570 --> 29:05.670
What now?

29:05.670 --> 29:07.880
Should we investigate the people
who made the movie?

29:10.080 --> 29:11.360
But it's strange.

29:12.010 --> 29:14.850
The voice and the acting don't
seem to match.

29:14.850 --> 29:17.420
It's a bit more husky and sexy.

29:17.420 --> 29:21.090
That's why I say Yun Se-A
is so great.

29:21.090 --> 29:24.760
Since she made her debut, her
songs became hits without even
seeing her.

29:25.130 --> 29:29.900
Finally, when everyone saw her
face, they were really shocked.

29:31.620 --> 29:33.570
It was very unexpected.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.770
Back then, her popularity was
beyond words.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.700
Yes, Yun Cheo Yong.

30:06.230 --> 30:07.700
Hello.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.170
Why did you want to see me?

30:09.540 --> 30:11.370
Do you have something
to tell me?

30:11.370 --> 30:14.680
I'm a bit uncomfortable,

30:15.040 --> 30:18.710
but I think I should tell you.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.910
Please go ahead.

30:21.650 --> 30:23.120
Actually,

30:24.220 --> 30:26.050
that person, Jo Jin Su...

30:26.050 --> 30:29.720
the day before Se-A was
kidnapped, I saw him in the
company parking lot.

30:31.190 --> 30:33.030
But what was strange,

30:34.130 --> 30:36.700
<i>is that Jo Jin Su and the
president,</i>

30:36.700 --> 30:40.000
<i>were whispering together.</i>

30:45.140 --> 30:48.080
<i>I don't know what they were
talking about, </i>

30:48.440 --> 30:51.010
<i>but it seemed very serious.</i>

30:51.380 --> 30:53.950
At first, I didn't think much
about it.

30:54.680 --> 30:58.720
But just now when you showed
us Jo Jin Su's photo,

30:58.720 --> 31:01.660
I thought it was suspicious.

31:09.730 --> 31:10.830
Right.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.770
That information, send it over
immediately.

31:16.700 --> 31:21.110
Just now, I was outside the
President's door and heard him
talking with a detective.

31:21.110 --> 31:22.210
Yun Se-A.

31:22.210 --> 31:22.940
Yun Se-A?

31:22.940 --> 31:24.410
Something really happened
to her.

31:24.410 --> 31:25.510
What's this?

31:25.510 --> 31:29.180
You were just eavesdropping?

31:29.180 --> 31:31.390
If I had know that, I would have
left with everybody.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.220
<i>I was afraid the detective would
see me, so I ran away.</i>

31:33.950 --> 31:35.420
<i>I have no idea.</i>

31:37.990 --> 31:39.460
This song.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.050
Could it be...

32:33.050 --> 32:35.250
this is what they're looking for?

32:36.350 --> 32:39.650
Because of this, everything
is ruined.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.100
What?

33:03.880 --> 33:05.710
You can't throw that away!

33:10.120 --> 33:11.220
Ajumma!

33:11.590 --> 33:12.320
Detective Lee.

33:12.690 --> 33:16.360
With Tae Gyeong, come and get
the parking lot CCTV recordings
for the past week.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.930
I heard Jo Jin Su met with
President Yu.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.030
There was a witness.

33:20.390 --> 33:21.860
Okay.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.910
=Yes, this is National Forensic
Sciences.=

33:36.910 --> 33:38.380
Yes, this is Yun Cheo Yong.

33:39.480 --> 33:42.420
Jo Jin Su. Can you apply for a
second autopsy?

33:44.990 --> 33:46.090
What?

33:46.090 --> 33:47.550
Where is the Crazy Detective?

33:47.920 --> 33:49.760
How can he not be here now?

33:50.120 --> 33:52.330
If they don't go now,
they won't find it.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.570
<i>When people with the same
four pillars meet, </i>

33:58.570 --> 34:02.970
<i>even a dead branch will flower
once a week. </i>

34:02.970 --> 34:05.540
Once a week...

34:07.740 --> 34:11.409
The last time I entered her body
was just over a week today.

34:11.409 --> 34:14.719
<i>But, balance must be maintained.</i>

34:15.449 --> 34:20.219
<i>If they tilt toward one side,
they can be swallowed up.</i>

34:20.219 --> 34:22.060
It should be fine this time.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.170
Alright! Success!

34:34.170 --> 34:36.370
Let's go. We have to check the
parking lot CCTV recordings.

34:36.370 --> 34:37.100
Hurry and finish up.

34:37.469 --> 34:38.940
Ajussi!

34:40.040 --> 34:41.510
Detective Yun, where are you?

34:41.870 --> 34:44.440
That's not important.
You have to check the trash bin!

34:44.440 --> 34:46.650
What's wrong with her all of a
sudden, saying strange things?

34:47.010 --> 34:48.480
I saw that spirit just now!

34:48.850 --> 34:51.790
President Yu had the original CD
of "Reborn" in his office!

34:52.150 --> 34:53.620
The original CD?

34:55.090 --> 34:56.560
Hey, high school student!

34:57.290 --> 34:59.130
=Oh, wait! Where?=

34:59.130 --> 35:00.960
She gets sick like that sometimes.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.430
Could it be stress-induced
hysteria?

35:02.800 --> 35:05.000
It's not hysteria.
It's a mystery, mystery.

35:14.170 --> 35:15.640
But Detective Jeong,

35:16.010 --> 35:19.680
This CD you suddenly mentioned,
how did you find out about it?

35:20.050 --> 35:21.880
Oh, it just happened.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.490
I'm sorry. I'll straighten it up.
Sorry.

35:31.670 --> 35:35.100
With bad taste like this,
you must not have a woman.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.400
Is this a nerd cosplay?

35:38.770 --> 35:40.970
That's much better and not
so boring!

35:45.740 --> 35:48.680
Is this some kind of new
push-pull or something?

35:50.880 --> 35:54.550
Is anyone here? Hey!

35:54.550 --> 35:55.280
Who is it?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.380
We're here to investigate.

36:01.150 --> 36:02.990
What the heck am I doing?

36:03.720 --> 36:06.660
But why do we need the
original CD right now?

36:06.660 --> 36:09.420
It's very important!

36:11.060 --> 36:12.900
Hurry!

36:16.260 --> 36:17.940
Do you really want to...

36:19.010 --> 36:22.080
Hurry. Hurry. Find it.

36:24.640 --> 36:28.320
You're not just going to stand
there, right? Detective Jeong.

36:28.680 --> 36:32.350
Don't you know?
I have a very weak stomach.

36:32.350 --> 36:34.190
Right, Detective Lee?

36:34.190 --> 36:37.120
Of course. Of course.

36:37.490 --> 36:40.430
Is this what you call a green light?
(flirting)

36:58.410 --> 37:02.820
What? It's broken.

37:03.550 --> 37:05.020
Can you restore it?

37:05.750 --> 37:10.160
A CD recording is burned onto
the surface of the disc.

37:10.160 --> 37:14.560
It can be seen with the
naked eye.

37:14.560 --> 37:20.430
If you look at the lead-in area,
the music files program area
didn't suffer much damage.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.740
That lead-in area bit was
about all I understood, kid.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.040
I meant that I could restore it.

37:41.350 --> 37:43.560
What? I came out again?

37:43.920 --> 37:45.760
What the heck?

37:54.200 --> 37:55.300
Detective Jeong.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.870
Are you really not going to
tell us?

37:58.240 --> 38:00.810
How did you know where the
original CD was?

38:02.280 --> 38:07.050
It was probably her detective's
sixth sense. Isn't that right?

38:07.410 --> 38:09.980
What sixth sense?
It was thanks to me!

38:17.690 --> 38:19.530
I'm going to the restroom.

38:21.730 --> 38:25.400
I mean, she just said it was
a nerd cosplay...

38:25.400 --> 38:26.870
- It's restored.
- It is?

38:27.230 --> 38:28.340
Play it.

38:37.880 --> 38:41.920
We could hear it on the internet,
so why did we dig through the
trash?

38:41.920 --> 38:43.380
Oh, this smell. Wow.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.590
Is there anything in here?

38:46.320 --> 38:53.290
Online streaming mp3 is at 16bit.
The sampling rate at 44.1KHz is
320Kbps sound quality.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.000
This original CD is known as
high definition.

38:56.020 --> 38:56.960
Say it simply.

38:56.960 --> 39:02.010
Simply put, it sounds exactly the
same as it did in the recording
studio.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.670
In other words, the mp3 won't
sound the same.

39:04.670 --> 39:06.870
That's right. But at a certain
frequency,

39:07.240 --> 39:09.440
<i>the instrument sounds, etc.,
all divide equally.</i>

39:10.180 --> 39:11.280
<i>Like this.</i>

39:12.010 --> 39:13.850
I can't find anything special.

39:13.850 --> 39:18.620
That's weird. There must be
something.

39:20.820 --> 39:22.290
What about the parking lot CCTV?

39:22.290 --> 39:24.490
I'm still looking.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.100
Take a look at this!

39:32.930 --> 39:35.500
Detective Yun said Jo Jin Su
met with President Yu.

39:35.500 --> 39:39.170
What are you doing? Go get
President Yu and bring him in.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.210
Who is it?

39:43.580 --> 39:45.050
<i>Police.</i>

39:47.610 --> 39:49.820
We have a warrant for
Yu Byeong Jun.

40:33.860 --> 40:35.330
Seonbae.

40:40.100 --> 40:43.400
This looks consistent with the
weapon described by Forensics.

41:04.320 --> 41:08.730
The blood on the weapon we
found was consistent with
Jo Jin Su's DNA.

41:08.730 --> 41:10.930
It also had President Yu's
fingerprints.

41:10.930 --> 41:12.400
Completely fooled.

41:12.770 --> 41:15.340
So hitting the manager was
just a show?

41:15.340 --> 41:16.440
Can you track his phone?

41:16.440 --> 41:18.640
For the last 3 hours, it's been
turned off.

41:18.640 --> 41:21.570
That bastard must know we're
looking for him.

41:22.310 --> 41:24.140
Give me the general information
on Yu Byeong Jun.

41:24.140 --> 41:24.510
Okay.

41:27.450 --> 41:28.920
Hey, what is that sound?

41:28.920 --> 41:30.750
- Turn it off.
<i>- I'm trapped in there.</i>

41:30.750 --> 41:34.790
- I'm sorry. I just hit the program.
<i>- Let me out.</i>

41:35.190 --> 41:36.050
Wait a moment.

41:36.070 --> 41:37.320
Ajussi, you heard it too.

41:37.330 --> 41:38.060
Didn't you?

41:38.160 --> 41:40.530
That part just now, play it again.

41:42.500 --> 41:48.740
<i>I'm trapped in there.
Let me out.</i>

41:48.740 --> 41:49.840
Let me out?

41:50.570 --> 41:52.170
Detective Jeong heard it, right?

41:52.320 --> 41:53.990
It wasn't just me, right?

41:54.010 --> 41:55.870
Hey. How did you do that?

41:55.900 --> 41:57.270
It's backward masking.

41:57.290 --> 41:57.980
Simply!

41:58.000 --> 41:59.380
It's a song played backward.

41:59.380 --> 42:02.320
It's something Seo Taeji and
The Boys used to do.

42:07.820 --> 42:08.830
<i>Ajussi!</i>

42:08.850 --> 42:11.120
Play it again from the beginning.

42:15.160 --> 42:21.030
<i>I'm still with the angels.</i>

42:22.140 --> 42:27.640
I'm trapped in there.

42:28.010 --> 42:29.480
Let me out.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.580
Angels.

42:30.580 --> 42:31.310
If it's angels, then...

42:31.680 --> 42:32.780
Maybe it's that...

42:51.500 --> 42:54.430
She came here 2 days before
she disappeared, is that right?

42:54.430 --> 42:57.370
It might have been trying to
say that Yun Se-A is in danger.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.210
She could be inside.

43:52.060 --> 43:54.260
<i>What is this?</i>

43:56.100 --> 43:57.930
Cheo Yong, what's going on?

45:30.060 --> 45:31.160
Right here.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.360
There's a foreign body.

46:01.990 --> 46:07.130
<i>According to DNA, this is Gim
Yeon Jin, who disappeared 6
years ago.</i>

46:07.860 --> 46:12.630
Since there was cement found
in her lungs,

46:12.630 --> 46:14.430
she was likely buried alive.

46:14.470 --> 46:15.940
How could she be alive?

46:15.940 --> 46:19.610
And this is a photo found inside
Gim Yeon Jin's wallet.

46:20.780 --> 46:23.070
So she knew Yun Se-A.

46:24.740 --> 46:27.680
What in the world is going
on here?

46:27.680 --> 46:33.920
We discovered Gim Yeon Jin and
Yun Se-A were trainees together
since they were 13 years old.

46:34.290 --> 46:36.860
What about that memory card
found on the body?

46:37.220 --> 46:41.630
There was a lot of corrosion, so it
will take some time to restore.

46:41.630 --> 46:45.300
But why did she have to
swallow the memory card?

46:47.130 --> 46:48.230
Hold on.

46:48.970 --> 46:53.010
Could Gim Yeon Jin also have
been killed by President Yu?

46:53.120 --> 46:56.020
It looks like he killed the person
he had kidnap Yun Se-A,

46:56.040 --> 46:57.780
so doesn't it seem to fit?

47:00.350 --> 47:01.810
Yu Byeong Jun's location?

47:01.810 --> 47:05.850
His phone is still turned off, so
we've applied for CCTV tracking.

47:06.220 --> 47:11.720
Why would President Yu kidnap
Yun Se-A right before her press
conference?

47:15.390 --> 47:18.700
If it wasn't to inform us that
Yun Se-A was in danger,

47:19.070 --> 47:22.000
there must be some other reason
Gim Yeon Jin appeared.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.840
What could it be?

47:27.870 --> 47:29.340
<i>It's the Yun Se-A song.</i>

47:31.360 --> 47:32.650
<i>Reborn?</i>

47:32.800 --> 47:35.210
<i>She has released 2 solo albums
every year.</i>

47:35.330 --> 47:39.250
<i>Every time she released a solo
album, the lights shattered,
the stage collapsed.</i>

47:39.320 --> 47:41.450
<i>The voice and the acting don't
seem to match.</i>

47:41.580 --> 47:44.760
<i>Her songs became hits without
even seeing her.</i>

47:44.760 --> 47:49.060
<i>Finally, when everyone saw her
face, they were really shocked.</i>

47:49.160 --> 47:51.360
You said Gim Yeon Jin
disappeared 6 years ago, right?

47:51.360 --> 47:52.470
Yes.

47:52.470 --> 47:55.030
The voice in Yun Se-A's songs,

47:55.030 --> 47:57.970
and the voice in her movies,
have a voiceprint analysis done.

47:57.970 --> 47:59.810
Why suddenly do a voiceprint
analysis?

48:02.380 --> 48:04.940
Hello and good evening
everyone.

48:05.170 --> 48:08.250
I'm Yun Se-A, back with a new
special album.

48:08.250 --> 48:09.720
<i>Help!</i>

48:15.220 --> 48:17.420
-=Voiceprint analysis: No Match=-

48:17.420 --> 48:18.890
Impossible.

48:19.630 --> 48:20.360
It's different.

48:20.360 --> 48:21.090
What's different?

48:21.090 --> 48:22.560
<i>They're completely different
people.</i>

48:22.560 --> 48:23.660
Wow.

48:24.030 --> 48:25.870
Could it get more shocking?

48:26.230 --> 48:28.430
Then, if it's not Yun Se-A
singing the song,

48:28.430 --> 48:29.540
who is singing?

48:29.540 --> 48:31.740
- No way.
- No way?

48:32.840 --> 48:33.940
No way what?

48:37.610 --> 48:39.080
No way!

48:39.080 --> 48:42.010
For the past 6 years, that's what
Gim Yeon has been trying to say.

48:42.010 --> 48:44.220
R-Ridiculous.

48:44.220 --> 48:46.420
This really is absurd.

48:47.520 --> 48:50.460
This case is starting to make
sense.

48:50.820 --> 48:56.330
The night before Yun Se-A's press
conference, she drank a lot and
was depressed.

48:56.330 --> 49:00.000
She had never made her own
songs before, and was criticized
for never singing live.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.200
<i>She had no choice but to
endure it. </i>

49:02.570 --> 49:03.670
<i>That's right.</i>

49:03.670 --> 49:06.970
According to the curse, a lot of
accidents occurred with her songs.

49:07.340 --> 49:08.810
It must have been difficult.

49:08.810 --> 49:14.310
Yun Se-A had probably decided
to expose everything at that
press conference, right?

49:14.310 --> 49:18.720
President Yu found out and had
Yun Se-A kidnapped to prevent
that.

49:19.450 --> 49:20.550
This makes sense.

49:20.550 --> 49:23.120
Even so, a lot of things still
haven't been explained.

49:23.490 --> 49:27.160
If President Yu killed Jo Jin Su
and left him inside that house,

49:27.160 --> 49:30.830
why did he keep the murder
weapon like that?

49:35.230 --> 49:37.070
Yes, Special Case Investigations.

49:40.370 --> 49:43.680
It's NSC Forensics Team about
Jo Jin Su's re-autopsy results.

49:43.680 --> 49:46.250
Re-autopsy? Why re-autopsy?

49:46.980 --> 49:48.810
Yes, please go ahead.

49:48.810 --> 49:53.220
=Per the request, we did an
in-depth analysis of Jo Jin Su's
brain.=

49:53.220 --> 49:54.690
Why the brain?

49:55.050 --> 49:57.260
I'm sending them to you.
Have a look.

50:00.190 --> 50:02.400
=Fax Received=

50:03.500 --> 50:04.600
What?

50:04.600 --> 50:06.800
You can send a fax by phone now?

50:07.900 --> 50:09.740
The world moves on.

50:10.100 --> 50:13.770
=After Detective Yun said he
had some concerns,=

50:13.770 --> 50:17.080
in the brain of Jo Jin Su, due to
ammonia caused by a drug,

50:17.220 --> 50:19.650
the extracellular aspartic
acid leak,

50:19.650 --> 50:22.210
was increased to four times that
of normal brain tissue.

50:22.950 --> 50:24.960
Your concerns were correct.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.260
It was brain necrosis caused
by hypoglycemic shock.

50:28.450 --> 50:30.290
If it was hypoglycemic shock,

50:31.020 --> 50:32.700
was it insulin overdose?

50:32.720 --> 50:33.780
=That's right.=

50:33.820 --> 50:38.360
Since insulin is secreted by the
body, it would never be found
without an autopsy.

50:38.360 --> 50:43.140
And after death, insulin will
naturally resolve, so it's very
difficult to discover.

50:43.140 --> 50:46.070
President Yu used insulin to
kill Jo Jin Su,

50:46.070 --> 50:48.270
and then stabbed him to hide it.

50:48.270 --> 50:51.940
But it wasn't President Yu.
It was Secretary Do Yong Jun.

50:53.410 --> 50:54.880
What do you mean by that?

50:55.610 --> 50:59.650
These are Do Yong Jun's medical
records from the Ministry of
Health and Welfare.

51:00.020 --> 51:01.850
Type 1 diabetes?

51:02.220 --> 51:05.160
This is really a big turn-around.

51:05.160 --> 51:08.090
I saw his hands tremble in the
President's office.

51:08.830 --> 51:10.660
<i>At first, I didn't pay any attention.</i>

51:10.660 --> 51:15.430
<i>But when Do Yong Jun was
talking about Jo Jin Su, his breath
had a chocolate smell.</i>

51:15.430 --> 51:19.110
I recalled that Jo Jin Su's first
cause of death was cardiac arrest,

51:19.110 --> 51:22.040
so I applied to the Ministry of
Health & Welfare for a re-autopsy.

51:22.040 --> 51:24.240
Then Do Yong Jun has become
the suspect?

51:24.240 --> 51:28.280
I'm still thinking about it.

51:40.390 --> 51:42.600
-=Detective=-

51:43.330 --> 51:44.800
=Yes, Detective.=

51:44.800 --> 51:46.630
This is Detective Jeong Ha Yun.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.200
=Have you found Se-A?=

51:49.940 --> 51:53.610
No, but according to what our
investigation has uncovered,

51:53.610 --> 51:56.540
we believe President Yu Byeong
Jun is the suspect.

51:56.540 --> 51:58.010
=Really?=

51:58.380 --> 52:00.950
=I just can't believe he could
do this!=

52:02.420 --> 52:04.980
It seems President Yu Byeong
Jun has escaped.

52:04.980 --> 52:10.490
=Would you happen to know
someplace President Yu Byeong
Jun would go?=

52:11.220 --> 52:13.060
<i>About that...</i>

52:13.430 --> 52:14.890
=I'm sorry.=

52:15.260 --> 52:16.360
=I will contact you later.=

52:16.730 --> 52:20.030
I'll look into it further and
then call you back.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.270
I don't think he suspected.

52:26.270 --> 52:28.840
Okay. Get ready to move.

52:45.360 --> 52:47.930
Congratulations, President.

52:50.130 --> 52:53.070
Oh, you must be bored.

52:54.530 --> 52:56.370
You've become a murderer.

52:58.200 --> 53:00.040
The police are combing the city.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.870
What the hell are you talking
about?

53:01.870 --> 53:03.710
You are finished.

53:04.080 --> 53:07.750
The suspect in kidnapping Yun
Se-A and murdering Jo Jin Su...

53:10.320 --> 53:12.150
it's all you.

53:12.890 --> 53:15.820
You did that?

53:16.190 --> 53:18.020
What did you do to Se-A?

53:19.130 --> 53:20.590
Se-A.

53:30.870 --> 53:37.480
Se-A... are you... okay?

53:38.580 --> 53:40.050
Are you surprised?

53:40.050 --> 53:42.250
I thought you would have
guessed by now.

53:45.180 --> 53:48.120
You... to me...

53:49.960 --> 53:51.790
How could you do this to me?

53:52.530 --> 53:58.400
It's really too bad, but Secretary
Do and I have to stop here now.

54:00.230 --> 54:02.070
<i>He said he'll do it if we pay him.</i>

54:02.070 --> 54:03.170
<i>Don't worry.</i>

54:03.540 --> 54:06.110
<i>I want to be sure the whole
plan is perfect.</i>

54:06.840 --> 54:08.310
<i>It's flawless.</i>

54:08.310 --> 54:11.240
<i>I've prepared everything carefully.</i>

54:13.080 --> 54:16.750
<i>Using our investor's name, our
new agency is ready to go.</i>

54:17.120 --> 54:20.420
<i>Once things calm down,
we'll start.</i>

54:20.420 --> 54:25.190
<i>You know? You're the only
person I can depend on.</i>

54:31.430 --> 54:33.630
So everything is going according
to plan?

54:33.630 --> 54:39.870
If you hadn't arranged that press
conference, things wouldn't have
become like this.

54:42.440 --> 54:46.480
<i>I won't do it! Why do I have
to take responsibility for people
dying?</i>

54:47.950 --> 54:50.880
<i>What else can I do?
The song was leaked. </i>

54:50.880 --> 54:53.090
<i>I'm not a singer now, I'm an actor!</i>

54:53.090 --> 54:54.920
<i>I don't want to lip sync anymore!</i>

54:55.290 --> 54:57.120
<i>Just do it one more time.</i>

54:57.860 --> 55:00.060
<i>This is really the last time.</i>

55:00.060 --> 55:01.530
<i>The last time.</i>

55:02.010 --> 55:04.580
<i>Isn't that also what you said
the last time?</i>

55:05.560 --> 55:09.600
<i>Do you mean after this press
conference, our relationship is over?</i>

55:09.600 --> 55:11.800
<i>Who are you to dare end things?</i>

55:11.800 --> 55:15.470
<i>Then, should we tell the reporters
about 6 years ago?</i>

55:19.880 --> 55:25.020
<i>After people hear about what was
done, how will they react?</i>

55:27.590 --> 55:31.260
That's when I decided things
should come to an end.

55:31.620 --> 55:35.290
So you're going to kill me just
like Yeon Jin?

55:36.030 --> 55:37.500
Who did you say?

55:38.230 --> 55:39.330
Who died?

55:39.330 --> 55:40.800
What are you talking about?

55:42.270 --> 55:44.470
Yeon Jin went to America!

55:44.990 --> 55:47.600
You've done all this without
knowing anything?

55:47.620 --> 55:49.670
You stupid bastard!

<i>Then when will my album...</i>

57:08.150 --> 57:09.620
<i>Didn't I tell you to wait?</i>

57:09.620 --> 57:11.820
<i>How long do I have to wait?</i>

57:12.190 --> 57:14.760
<i>Didn't you say if I helped make
Se-A popular, you'd let me debut?</i>

57:15.130 --> 57:16.600
<i>Yeon Jin!</i>

57:18.060 --> 57:19.160
<i>Really.</i>

57:24.300 --> 57:25.400
<i>President.</i>

57:25.400 --> 57:27.610
<i>All my songs are on Se-A's album.</i>

57:27.970 --> 57:30.910
<i>To make my debut album, I
produced and sang the songs.</i>

57:32.010 --> 57:33.110
<i>We're back.</i>

57:34.580 --> 57:36.780
<i>Yeon Jin, you're here?</i>

57:36.780 --> 57:39.350
<i>From the beginning, you never
thought about letting me debut.</i>

57:39.350 --> 57:41.550
<i>You've just used me for
over 2 years.</i>

57:45.220 --> 57:46.330
<i>Yeon Jin!</i>

57:53.670 --> 57:55.130
<i>Yeon Jin.</i>

57:55.500 --> 57:57.340
<i>Talk to me.</i>

57:59.170 --> 58:00.270
<i>I don't have anything to say.</i>

58:00.270 --> 58:01.740
<i>I don't either.</i>

58:01.740 --> 58:03.580
<i>You know this is all the
President's fault.</i>

58:03.940 --> 58:09.450
<i>When President Yu first proposed
this, I said okay because you
were having a hard time.</i>

58:10.180 --> 58:14.220
<i>He said I'd only have to sing
along with you once.</i>

58:14.220 --> 58:17.890
<i>Yeon Jin, can't you just wait
a little longer?</i>

58:17.890 --> 58:19.360
<i>Just until the album is finished.</i>

58:19.360 --> 58:21.930
<i>And then I'll have to wait again,
right?</i>

58:22.660 --> 58:25.600
<i>President Yu will never give it up.</i>

58:25.960 --> 58:28.900
<i>Can you give it up?</i>

58:30.740 --> 58:32.200
<i>I'm going to expose it all.</i>

58:33.310 --> 58:37.710
<i>I can no longer tolerate my songs
being stolen.</i>

58:41.750 --> 58:42.850
<i>Right.</i>

59:45.610 --> 59:48.180
<i>Think about it again,
Gim Yeon Jin.</i>

59:51.850 --> 59:54.050
<i>Please don't cause trouble
for us now.</i>

59:54.050 --> 59:55.520
<i>This is my last request.</i>

<i>You've changed.</i>

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.290
<i>Very much!</i>

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:01.760
<i>Do you know that?</i>

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:05.060
<i>I guess you're still going
to do it?</i>

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:17.540
<i>Fine. Have your press conference.</i>

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:20.480
<i>I don't want to live this fake
life either.</i>

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.820
<i>I'll go there with you and explain. </i>

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:31.120
<i>I'll say that all my songs for the
past 2 years were yours.</i>

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:34.060
<i>That you were singing from
backstage.</i>

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.070
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.370
<i>Please understand me.</i>

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.780

<i>Besides...</i>

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:19.940
<i>President... it's me.</i>

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.010
<i>What should I do?</i>

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:40.630
<i>What's wrong with Yeon Jun?</i>

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:42.690
<i>If she had a press conference,
then I...</i>

01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:44.160
<i>No, all of us would be finished.</i>

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.470
<i>Using her songs, we could have
gone on a few more years.</i>

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:51.870
<i>But we don't need her now.</i>

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.650
So... So...

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:09.860
You killed Yeon Jun?

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.690
What else could I do?

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:13.530
She was going to finish us.

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:16.830
Thanks to her, we've all been
doing well.

01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:18.660
But how could you do that?

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.650
How could you?

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:23.070
To poor Yeon Jun.

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:25.270
You're really weak.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.210
Fortunately, I made the right
decision.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:35.180
You did it even to me...

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:37.750
In the wine.

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:44.360
You...

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.710
Just what are you planning?

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.010
You're going to kill both of us?

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:13.350
- Yun Se-A!
- Spare me.

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:15.190
She really is crazy.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.020
Spare me!

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.730
Yun Se-A, stop!

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.200
It's all over.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.870
Be careful. She has a lighter.

01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:33.910
You are Yun Se-A.

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:37.210
I guess you already know
everything.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.150
No. It won't end like this!

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.080
Put it down.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.120
Everyone here can die together,
how about it?

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.690
If I want people to remember
Yun Se-A,

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:51.890
this is the only way!

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.730
No! No!

01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:58.860
This will be a truly sad ending.

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:03.270
What happened?

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.380
It's Yeon Jun.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.290
Don't!

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:27.490
<i>Stay away!</i>

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:29.690
Don't!

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.730
Stay away!

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.570
Stay away!

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.340
Don't!

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.380
<i>Don't!</i>

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:26.950
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:28.050
<i>How do you do this?</i>

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:29.890
<i>This. Like this.</i>

01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:30.990
<i>It's on.</i>

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:32.090
<i>Okay.</i>

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:33.560
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:37.230
<i>Thanks to you...</i>

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.060
<i>Let's do it together.</i>

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:43.920
<i>Hello.</i>

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.970
<i>Let's start practicing.</i>

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:50.080
<i>We look good, right?</i>

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.180
<i>Hurry and go.</i>

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.280
<i>Hurry and start.</i>

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:17.970
President Yu and Secretary Do
have confessed.

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:21.200
<i>You don't have to keep up the act.</i>

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.480
<i>Yun Se-A, you...</i>

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.410
not only stole Gim Yeon Jun's
voice and life,

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:30.820
you also stole all of her treasured
songs and dreams.

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:33.390
You took everything from her.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.990
It's a shame.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:45.130
If I had known this before,
I would also have burned up
Gim Yeon Jin.

01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:54.670
<i>- We're starting now.
- Fine.</i>

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.140

<i>Hello. I'm a 12-year-old, fifth-
grader, Gim Yeon Jin.</i>

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:17.800
<i>I really love to sing. </i>

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.370
<i>When I grow up, I want to be
a good singer.</i>

01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.200
<i>Also...</i>

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.710
<i>I will sing my favorite song.</i>

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.920
Detective Jeong, what are
you doing?

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.960
Just wrapping things up.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.260
How did you know?

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.030
You said there was someone
besides Secretary Do Yong Jun.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.330
If it were discovered that
Yun Se-A wasn't singing,

01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:59.270
who would stand to lose the most?

01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:01.470
I just had to answer that.

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:05.510
There was one person who
had the most to lose.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.450
But there's still something I
don't understand.

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:11.020
If not President Yu or
Secretary Do,

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.050
who leaked that song?

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:17.260
The one who cursed Yun Se-A?

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:18.479
What?

01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:29.000
Lately those two have looked
at each other strangely.

01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:32.300
Should I get involved with this?

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.240
Substitute driver?
