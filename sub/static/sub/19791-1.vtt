WEBVTT

00:00.841 --> 00:02.201
Oh, my God!

00:02.301 --> 00:05.202
There he is, and he's huge.

00:09.641 --> 00:12.142
You gotta admit, that's a big burrito.

00:15.481 --> 00:17.614
Danny, do you remember this morning

00:17.649 --> 00:20.484
when you said I've been
"edgy" for the last two months,

00:20.519 --> 00:23.487
and if I don't calm down, I'll
never make it through the next 11?

00:25.424 --> 00:27.424
First of all, honey, your math is off.

00:27.459 --> 00:29.520
And second, you're about
to see the next level

00:29.546 --> 00:31.361
of edgy if you don't
stop messing around.

00:31.396 --> 00:33.363
Because if we get thrown out
of here and I lose my doctor,

00:33.398 --> 00:36.566
I will rain down a level of edge
on you you never even knew existed.

00:38.303 --> 00:40.604
Doctor Hastings and I have been
planning the birth of my first child

00:40.639 --> 00:42.639
since I was a little girl,
and she is the only woman

00:42.674 --> 00:43.640
who can deliver this baby.

00:43.675 --> 00:45.542
So if I lose my doctor, I lose my mind.

00:45.577 --> 00:48.411
And if I lose my mind... Well, I think
we both know how that goes, Danny.

00:48.447 --> 00:49.546
Don't we? Don't we?

00:50.616 --> 00:52.382
I think so.

00:52.417 --> 00:54.284
- I'll go find the doctor.
- Yeah, good idea.

01:10.169 --> 01:12.536
I swallowed a penny when I was six and
I wanted to see if it was still there.

01:14.206 --> 01:15.472
Where's the doctor?

01:15.507 --> 01:16.540
Honey,

01:16.575 --> 01:19.442
Dr. Hastings has gone to a better place.

01:19.478 --> 01:22.345
She switched hospitals?
She didn't even tell me.

01:22.381 --> 01:24.548
Well, she's dead, so she
probably didn't have time to call.

I'm just saying, if you're
gonna call someone fat,

01:39.631 --> 01:41.531
you've gotta use your inside voice.

01:45.504 --> 01:48.638
"Oh! Oh, come to LA. It's amazing."

01:48.674 --> 01:50.573
"Oh, oh. Oh, LA?"

01:50.609 --> 01:53.610
More like Hell-A!

01:53.645 --> 01:57.681
Oh, look, Uncle Tucker's getting snap,
crackle, drunk for breakfast again.

01:57.716 --> 02:01.518
Yeah, well there's no reason to be
sober when you've got nowhere to go.

02:03.655 --> 02:05.522
I've got nowhere to go, man.

02:06.692 --> 02:09.526
You'll find another job, dude.

02:09.561 --> 02:11.528
Come on, just tell me
what happened in LA.

02:11.563 --> 02:12.595
Was it that bad?

02:12.631 --> 02:14.597
No. No, it was amazing.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.499
Yeah, I just missed you all so much,

02:16.535 --> 02:17.634
I had to come back home.

02:17.669 --> 02:19.502
Yes, it was bad!

02:19.538 --> 02:21.571
Well, you gotta figure something out.

02:21.606 --> 02:22.672
You're kind of pathetic.

02:22.708 --> 02:24.541
Hold up. I'm pathetic?

02:26.511 --> 02:28.578
How many times have you been
to the dry cleaners this week,

02:28.613 --> 02:33.616
looking for some girl you saw two
months ago for, like, two seconds?

02:33.652 --> 02:35.618
Zero.

02:35.654 --> 02:37.520
What's that in your hand?

02:37.556 --> 02:39.522
You owe me 26.50 for your boxers.

02:39.558 --> 02:40.590
Light starch.

02:42.527 --> 02:44.461
I bet you don't even know her name.

02:44.496 --> 02:46.563
Sure, I do. It's Mrs. Ben Wheeler.

02:46.598 --> 02:48.565
Cute.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.633
And it wasn't once, it was three times.

02:50.669 --> 02:52.469
That has got to mean something.

02:52.504 --> 02:53.536
Not really.

02:53.572 --> 02:55.472
No, I ran into Bald
Marcia from that weird

02:55.507 --> 02:57.540
yogurt kabob place four times yesterday,

02:57.576 --> 02:59.509
and I don't want to have sex with her.

03:01.446 --> 03:02.645
I bet you don't even
remember what she looks like.

03:02.681 --> 03:04.481
Course I do.

03:04.516 --> 03:06.516
She has
beautiful... red...

03:06.551 --> 03:08.585
- Brown.
- Brown hair,

03:08.620 --> 03:10.387
with piercing
green...

03:10.422 --> 03:11.588
- Blue.
- Blue-green eyes.

03:11.623 --> 03:13.556
And is
about this...

03:13.592 --> 03:15.291
- More.
- This tall.

03:20.499 --> 03:22.399
Oh, my God, dude. It's her.

03:22.434 --> 03:24.267
Emma! It worked!

03:24.302 --> 03:28.238
I posted one of those Missed
Connections, and she answered!

03:28.273 --> 03:30.673
She's been looking for me
like I've been looking for her.

03:30.709 --> 03:33.243
I think I am gonna wear
my favorite black shirt.

03:33.278 --> 03:34.644
- Blue.
- Favorite blue shirt.

03:37.516 --> 03:38.648
I mean, how can Dr. Hastings be dead?

03:38.683 --> 03:40.583
She was such a vibrant 87.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.420
What am I supposed to do now?

03:43.455 --> 03:44.554
- "We," what are we supposed...
- Not we.

03:44.589 --> 03:45.688
Not we. Me. Okay?

03:45.724 --> 03:48.491
Only one of us is growing a
human being in their uterus

03:48.527 --> 03:50.493
and having it yanked out
by a stranger in six months.

03:52.464 --> 03:55.265
Hey, why don't we just
ask my mom for her doc?

03:55.300 --> 03:56.699
I mean, she pretty much
has the same lady parts.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.637
Oh, God, I think I just ruined sex.

04:00.672 --> 04:04.240
Danny, you cannot tell your
mother that my gyno died.

04:04.276 --> 04:06.179
All right? She's already,
like, some pregnancy

04:06.205 --> 04:07.677
advice faucet that
I can't turn off.

04:07.712 --> 04:10.647
Yesterday, she told
me it's okay to drink

04:10.682 --> 04:13.416
because I'm still not
showing and no one will know.

04:14.719 --> 04:17.454
Okay, you have to promise me that
you will keep her away from me.

04:17.488 --> 04:18.555
I promise.

04:18.589 --> 04:20.457
But she and Brad are
leaving in a couple days

04:20.492 --> 04:22.292
for their
around-the-world tour,

04:22.327 --> 04:23.426
so you won't have to deal
with it for about a year.

04:25.464 --> 04:27.330
Oh, sweetie, are you okay? What's wrong?

04:27.365 --> 04:28.364
A year?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.333
I'm just so happy.

04:32.404 --> 04:33.670
Oh.

04:33.705 --> 04:35.271
Hey, Riles.

04:35.307 --> 04:37.707
I just found the most amazing
cream for your nipples.

04:40.278 --> 04:41.544
My nipples are fine.

04:41.580 --> 04:42.712
They won't be.

04:42.747 --> 04:45.648
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

04:46.685 --> 04:49.619
Okay, hey. Honey, here.
You've got to hide this.

04:49.654 --> 04:51.454
Why am I hiding your passport?

04:51.490 --> 04:53.456
Because I'm not going with Brad to Peru

04:53.492 --> 04:57.327
or Kathmandu or, or any
place ending in "ooh."

04:57.362 --> 04:59.395
What are you gonna tell him?
He'll be so disappointed.

04:59.431 --> 05:02.332
Which is exactly why you're going
to tell him that I can't leave

05:02.367 --> 05:04.267
because Riley needs me.

05:04.302 --> 05:05.368
I'm not sure she does.

05:05.403 --> 05:07.670
Sweetie, it's her first baby.

05:07.706 --> 05:10.273
The first always needs extra attention.

05:10.308 --> 05:12.642
The second baby, that's
when you can start slacking.

05:13.712 --> 05:15.578
Listen, there's gonna be some problems.

05:15.614 --> 05:16.613
Oh, there already are.

05:16.648 --> 05:18.548
Her lady doc just died.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.483
That was a secret.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.585
Why don't you just take her to my guy?

05:22.621 --> 05:24.420
Dr. Marsh.

05:24.456 --> 05:25.788
So hot.

05:25.824 --> 05:29.325
There's nothing like a sexy
mechanic working under the hood.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.297
Sorry. Anyway, listen.

05:34.332 --> 05:37.333
Remember, you and Riley
can't live without me.

05:37.369 --> 05:38.301
Mm?

05:38.336 --> 05:41.337
Danny! Just the person
I was looking for.

05:41.373 --> 05:43.640
I need you to convince
your mom to go away with me.

05:43.675 --> 05:45.522
You need to let her
know that you and Riley

05:45.548 --> 05:47.243
will be perfectly fine
here on your own.

05:47.279 --> 05:49.612
So that's two "go" and one "stay."

05:51.550 --> 05:54.417
Never quite sure you and I
are paddling up the same river.

05:56.588 --> 05:59.522
Yes, for the last time, I'll
move on if this doesn't work out.

05:59.558 --> 06:01.457
But it's gonna work out.

06:01.493 --> 06:03.393
Crap, do I have time to work out?

06:03.428 --> 06:05.395
Maybe just a couple push-ups?

06:07.365 --> 06:09.332
Is that her? That's not her, is it?

06:09.367 --> 06:10.667
No.

06:10.702 --> 06:12.268
I knew that.

06:15.707 --> 06:17.507
"Hey, I'm here. I just walked in."

06:18.577 --> 06:20.476
Aw, man, it's the
wrong Missed Connection.

06:20.512 --> 06:21.511
Now, what do I do?

06:21.546 --> 06:23.546
Go connect with that girl. She's hot.

06:23.582 --> 06:25.381
But she's not my girl.

06:25.417 --> 06:26.482
But she could be.

06:26.518 --> 06:28.451
Dude, she's obviously single. Right?

06:28.486 --> 06:30.353
And as desperate as you are.

06:30.388 --> 06:32.322
And she thinks her guy didn't come,

06:32.357 --> 06:34.357
so her self-esteem
is at an all-time low.

06:34.392 --> 06:36.326
Man, even Emma could
go in there and get her.

06:37.629 --> 06:40.263
Tucker, Dry Cleaner Girl and
I are gonna be married someday.

06:42.267 --> 06:43.508
Which means I should
probably get as much

06:43.534 --> 06:44.626
as I can before then.
Good thinking.

06:46.338 --> 06:47.570
Aw.

06:47.606 --> 06:49.639
It's just like how your
Daddy met your Mommy.

06:49.674 --> 06:51.608
He didn't know her name either.

06:54.546 --> 06:55.511
Die, die, die!

06:58.383 --> 06:59.415
Oh!

06:59.451 --> 07:01.384
"The do's and don'ts of diaper rash."

07:01.419 --> 07:02.485
- This is gonna be fascinating.
- Mm-hmm.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.222
Ah, pretending to care.

07:06.258 --> 07:07.323
You're gonna be a great Dad.

07:08.426 --> 07:10.360
I just needed a little break from Riley.

07:10.395 --> 07:14.297
If only there was somebody around
who's been through this before,

07:14.332 --> 07:17.200
you know, some kind of
mother figure who could help.

07:17.235 --> 07:20.203
Right, a mother figure, like
you. You'd be perfect, Mom.

07:20.238 --> 07:22.205
But weren't you just saying what
a wonderful idea this trip is

07:22.240 --> 07:24.540
and how it's a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?

07:24.576 --> 07:27.510
Yes. Yes, I do now recall
saying something just like that.

07:27.545 --> 07:30.118
Yeah, yeah. But weren't
you also just saying

07:30.144 --> 07:32.348
that Riley can't get
along without me?

07:32.384 --> 07:33.383
That might have come up as well.

07:33.418 --> 07:36.252
But this trip is just
so important to us.

07:37.289 --> 07:38.354
Exactly. You should go.

07:38.390 --> 07:39.355
Really?

07:39.391 --> 07:41.257
You heard the man. He said we should go.

07:41.293 --> 07:42.325
Yeah, I heard him say
that we should stay.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.693
Well, perhaps he's just confused.

07:43.728 --> 07:45.695
How could he be confused?
Are you confused, Danny?

07:47.265 --> 07:48.298
Danny? Danny, hi.

07:48.333 --> 07:49.599
Oh, Riley, I missed you.

07:49.634 --> 07:50.667
Oh! Okay, guess what?

07:50.702 --> 07:52.602
I got an appointment with
that doctor you found,

07:52.637 --> 07:53.703
the one who treats
all the Rangers' wives.

07:53.738 --> 07:55.471
Wait. You didn't take her to my guy?

07:55.507 --> 07:56.873
Ew, no.

07:56.908 --> 07:58.641
Oh, I can't wait to meet this completely
different doctor than my mom's.

07:58.677 --> 08:00.310
- Let's go. Come on.
- Oh.

08:02.347 --> 08:05.281
Well, that's not how I thought
this day was gonna turn out.

08:05.317 --> 08:07.250
Heh. Me neither.

08:07.285 --> 08:09.185
But we definitely connected.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.654
I mean, I connected first,
but then you did too, right?

08:13.325 --> 08:14.590
Sure.

08:17.696 --> 08:19.195
Oh.

08:20.532 --> 08:21.631
Oh, my God.

08:21.666 --> 08:22.632
It's her!

08:22.667 --> 08:23.666
Her? Her who?

08:23.702 --> 08:26.502
Her. The girl, the girl I was just...

08:27.539 --> 08:29.539
thinking is not as hot as you. Pfft.

08:29.574 --> 08:31.541
So, uh... Who...
Who... Who's that?

08:33.544 --> 08:36.312
The one on the left
is my friend, Amanda.

08:36.347 --> 08:38.414
And the other one, I don't
really know. "L" something.

08:40.719 --> 08:42.318
Well, "L" what?

08:42.354 --> 08:44.620
Laura, Lisa, Linda?

08:44.656 --> 08:46.255
Man, I had a good Linda once.

08:47.625 --> 08:48.691
I had a good Lisa twice.

08:50.628 --> 08:53.563
Uh, uh, but the other woman,
the one you're friends with,

08:53.598 --> 08:56.466
she looks super familiar. Does
she live in the neighborhood?

08:56.501 --> 08:57.433
No.

08:58.470 --> 09:00.403
She does work around the corner, though.

09:02.307 --> 09:04.307
Right, uh, at the place

09:04.342 --> 09:05.441
next to the other place.

09:05.477 --> 09:07.310
The lingerie store on "A."

09:07.345 --> 09:09.178
That's it. Heh!

09:09.214 --> 09:11.180
I... I go there all the time.

09:12.283 --> 09:13.583
With my mom.

09:15.253 --> 09:16.619
We got a weird, uh...

09:16.654 --> 09:18.521
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

09:24.216 --> 09:27.394
Obviously I had to leave LA. Right?

09:27.494 --> 09:30.261
You would have done the same
thing if that happened to you.

09:31.865 --> 09:32.864
Thank you, Dr. Emma.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.767
I found her!

09:35.802 --> 09:36.901
Yeah, I know. I was there.

09:36.937 --> 09:39.771
No. No, no, no. Not that
her. The original her.

09:39.806 --> 09:42.107
The dry-cleaner- scooter-taxi her.
This her.

09:43.143 --> 09:44.676
I found this at Olivia's house.

09:44.711 --> 09:48.680
The girl from the bar. Well,
found, stole... semantics.

09:48.715 --> 09:51.049
Dude, this is great. Is
Olivia gonna help you find her?

09:51.084 --> 09:53.017
Well, probably not,
since we just had sex.

09:54.087 --> 09:55.987
Hello, baby.

09:56.022 --> 09:58.089
Oh, I just told her it's
another word for cookie.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.057
It's all right.

10:00.961 --> 10:04.796
But all I gotta do is find this chick
Amanda who will lead me to my chick.

10:05.866 --> 10:06.831
My chick.

10:07.901 --> 10:09.701
Oh, my God. That sounds so romantic.

10:10.837 --> 10:12.137
This is her, right?

10:12.172 --> 10:13.738
Yes.

10:13.774 --> 10:17.675
Wait. What about the girl
you just had cookies with?

10:18.712 --> 10:20.678
Well, obviously I'm
not gonna see her again.

10:20.714 --> 10:22.714
Come on, man. I have a girlfriend now.

10:22.749 --> 10:25.083
I can't cheat on... "L" something.

10:28.121 --> 10:29.954
Oh, my God.

10:29.990 --> 10:31.890
Is that the heartbeat?

10:31.925 --> 10:33.892
That's the heartbeat.
There's a baby in there!

10:33.927 --> 10:35.827
He's just like my burrito.

10:35.862 --> 10:36.861
Except we made this together.

10:37.964 --> 10:39.831
Well, I will tell you one thing.

10:39.866 --> 10:42.167
You won't forget this birth.

10:42.202 --> 10:45.103
I know. First one's always
the most exciting, right?

10:45.138 --> 10:47.806
No, I mean it's probably going
to split you from tip to tail.

10:47.841 --> 10:49.140
It's gonna be huge.

10:50.744 --> 10:52.076
So you can say goodbye to this bod.

10:56.082 --> 10:57.148
What have you done to me?

10:57.184 --> 11:00.885
All right, it's gonna be
okay. Just keep breathing.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.921
I'm gonna go talk to the
doctor about his bedside manner.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.157
Hey, Doc. Can I talk to you for a sec?

11:06.193 --> 11:08.927
By the way, last time I had
a pretty quick breast exam.

11:08.962 --> 11:10.862
Tell the doctor to take his time today.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.800
Oh. Hey, Dr. Marsh.

11:15.836 --> 11:18.670
Great stuff in there, by the way,
but I got a quick heads up for you.

11:18.705 --> 11:19.737
How can I help?

11:19.773 --> 11:22.106
Bonnie Wheeler is also
a patient of yours,

11:22.142 --> 11:24.709
and, well, I'm Danny Wheeler.

11:24.744 --> 11:27.979
And my girlfriend, Riley, would
"rain down a level of edge"

11:28.014 --> 11:30.048
I didn't even know
existed if she finds out

11:30.116 --> 11:31.950
that both of them are
seeing the same doctor.

11:31.985 --> 11:34.052
"And we both know how that
goes. Don't we, Danny? Don't we?"

11:35.989 --> 11:38.022
Oh, heh. Sorry, Doc.

11:38.058 --> 11:39.958
That's sort of my big little secret.

11:39.993 --> 11:41.893
Yeah, I can see the problem.

11:41.928 --> 11:43.928
Oh, thanks, Doc.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.763
You might have just saved my life.

11:50.203 --> 11:51.703
What up, Doc?

11:51.738 --> 11:54.172
Bonnie. How've you been?

11:54.207 --> 11:57.075
Tee-rrific.

11:57.110 --> 11:59.978
Sorry I haven't been here in
a while, but I got married.

12:00.013 --> 12:03.047
I know. I know, we used
to kind of have a thing.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.949
- Did we?
- We could have.

12:06.853 --> 12:08.820
Anyway, he's much younger than me

12:08.855 --> 12:09.988
and he gets very jealous.

12:10.023 --> 12:11.890
Yeah, Bonnie, we need to talk.

12:11.925 --> 12:14.726
All right. Oh.

12:16.897 --> 12:18.696
Your husband was just here.

12:18.732 --> 12:19.205
Mm-hmm?

12:19.231 --> 12:21.124
And I think he got
another woman pregnant.

12:22.135 --> 12:23.134
What?

12:24.704 --> 12:26.104
That's weird. That
sounded just like your mom.

12:28.742 --> 12:30.074
Oddly enough,

12:30.110 --> 12:33.011
that is how Bonnie and I learned
that we are allergic to latex.

12:37.884 --> 12:39.918
Yo, can we just watch TV, man?

12:40.987 --> 12:41.986
I did it!

12:42.022 --> 12:45.723
I am one step closer to
finding Dry Cleaner Girl.

12:45.759 --> 12:47.859
Some chick he's never met
but is in love with. Yeah.

12:47.894 --> 12:50.795
That sounds so romantic.

12:50.830 --> 12:53.765
Her name is Amanda and she's
best friends with "L" something.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.333
Oh, so you told her you're
in love with her friend?

12:55.368 --> 12:56.823
Well, I meant to, but
it would have been

12:56.849 --> 12:58.161
super awkward after
we just had sex.

13:00.073 --> 13:01.973
You had sex with her too?

13:02.008 --> 13:03.941
Yeah. And if I have
to, I'll have sex

13:03.967 --> 13:06.077
with another 100 girls
to get to my girl.

13:06.112 --> 13:09.013
Huh. So, not romantic at all.

13:10.951 --> 13:13.985
Yeah, man, you might want to leave
that part out when you finally meet her.

13:14.020 --> 13:17.789
Which I will be doing tonight because
Amanda just invited me to a barbecue

13:17.824 --> 13:19.724
that "L" something will be at.

13:19.759 --> 13:20.892
Fate apparently has my back.

13:20.927 --> 13:22.860
And what's gonna
happen when you see her?

13:22.896 --> 13:24.796
Oh, good question.

13:24.831 --> 13:27.131
I mean,
a handshake seems super cold

13:27.167 --> 13:28.933
considering we are gonna
be married one day and...

13:28.969 --> 13:33.805
probably move to Connecticut with our
dog, Dude, Emma, and our three boys...

13:33.840 --> 13:35.707
Bennie, Benjamin, and Benzo.

13:37.043 --> 13:38.109
So I guess I'll go with a hug?

13:38.144 --> 13:41.079
Yeah, I meant what do you
think Amanda is going to do

13:41.114 --> 13:43.114
since she invited you to be her date?

13:43.149 --> 13:45.950
Good point, Tuck. Back to you, Ben.

13:47.854 --> 13:49.887
Right. Oh! I know.

13:49.923 --> 13:51.856
Why don't you come with
me and hit on Amanda?

13:51.891 --> 13:53.224
She's kind of a sure thing.

13:53.259 --> 13:54.892
Wait, wait, wait. What about
the girl who led you to Amanda?

13:54.928 --> 13:55.893
What if she's there?

13:55.929 --> 13:57.862
Aw, damn it. I forgot about Olivia.

13:57.897 --> 13:59.697
Olivia! I knew an Olivia once.

13:59.733 --> 14:02.667
Trapeze artist. She
used to swing me from...

14:02.702 --> 14:03.768
Please don't tell your mother.

14:05.672 --> 14:07.038
Oh, this is perfect.

14:07.073 --> 14:09.107
Why don't you come and take care
of Olivia if she becomes a problem.

14:09.142 --> 14:10.641
I love you, son.

14:10.677 --> 14:13.044
But I don't think I should kill for you.

14:16.953 --> 14:19.624
And... he took her to my doctor.

14:19.724 --> 14:21.627
My doctor.

14:21.727 --> 14:25.629
How could he get another woman pregnant?

14:25.664 --> 14:27.564
Well, there's gotta be another explanation.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.700
That doesn't sound like our Brad
at all. He would never lie to you.

14:29.735 --> 14:31.635
Hm. Oh, really?

14:31.670 --> 14:33.704
Then what's he doing in Brooklyn

14:33.739 --> 14:36.507
when he said that he was
at a golf course in Jersey?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.543
I had him chipped like
a dog the day I met him.

14:39.578 --> 14:40.911
I didn't know you could do that.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.446
I got a guy.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.814
Ironically...

14:43.849 --> 14:45.482
his name is Chip.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.919
Okay. All right, you
know what we are doing?

14:48.954 --> 14:51.722
We are going to Brooklyn to
get to the bottom of this.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.757
All right, you and Brad
need to stay together

14:53.793 --> 14:55.893
so you can go on your super long trip

14:55.928 --> 15:00.631
to all those wonderful places where
there's no Wi-Fi, or reception,

15:00.666 --> 15:02.766
or any other means of communicating
with the outside world.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.537
What you two have is so special.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.505
You're an inspiration to us.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.575
And... Mrs. Wheeler,
your happiness is just...

15:11.610 --> 15:13.577
it's everything to Danny and me.

15:13.612 --> 15:14.878
Oh.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.447
Too far?

15:16.482 --> 15:17.581
I wasn't listening.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.826
All right, huddle up, boys.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.794
See, this is why we don't
play sports on the weekends.

15:30.830 --> 15:31.862
Okay.

15:31.897 --> 15:33.730
I think we're gonna need
to divide and conquer.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.667
Because so far, there have
been no "L" something sightings.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.602
Ooh! That's Amanda.

15:38.637 --> 15:39.670
Tucker, get to flirting.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.476
Okay. How can I help?

15:45.511 --> 15:47.578
I am ready to flirt. Send me in, Coach.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.513
Start discreetly asking
around about Olivia.

15:50.549 --> 15:51.882
- Olivia!
- Discreet!

15:51.917 --> 15:53.517
Right. Olivia!

15:54.553 --> 15:56.887
Where... are... you?

15:59.825 --> 16:01.592
Hey there.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.286
Man, I know this was a
barbecue, but nobody

16:03.312 --> 16:04.820
told me that there'd
be honey biscuits.

16:06.732 --> 16:07.831
I'm Tucker.

16:10.703 --> 16:11.735
Maybe you didn't hear me. I'm Tucker.

16:13.739 --> 16:14.771
Oh, that's how it's gonna be?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.573
Do we know each other?

16:16.609 --> 16:17.641
We could, but you keep playing.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.612
Ah, here she is, my blushing bride.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.481
I swear, I'm the luckiest man alive.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.617
Aw! That is so sweet.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.419
I think I just met someone
really special, too.

16:30.456 --> 16:31.488
Aw, sweetie.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.856
I just told you I have a wife.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.426
Look, I just started seeing someone.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.861
It's fine.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.897
No skin off my back. I didn't have
to come over here and talk to you.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.798
I'm only doing a friend a favor

16:41.834 --> 16:44.668
who pretty much guaranteed
me that you were a sure thing.

16:44.703 --> 16:45.802
- Excuse me?
- I've said too much.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.706
She knows me so well.

16:49.742 --> 16:53.544
Sometimes I think she's
got a GPS planted in me.

16:53.579 --> 16:57.614
Aha! Yeah. I caught you with
your hand in the skank jar.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.416
Bon-Bon, what are you doing here?

16:59.451 --> 17:01.418
Busting you with your "who-er."

17:02.488 --> 17:04.387
- Excuse me?
- Oh, you heard me.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.490
What are you, like, four?
Five months pregnant?

17:07.526 --> 17:09.826
Uh, look, I don't know
who any of you people are,

17:09.862 --> 17:12.863
but I'm not pregnant and I
happen to have a new boyfriend.

17:12.897 --> 17:14.431
I'm dating Ben Wheeler.

17:14.465 --> 17:16.800
You're dating my son and my husband?

17:16.835 --> 17:18.702
Even I wouldn't do that.

17:18.737 --> 17:19.736
You had sex with my dad.

17:20.772 --> 17:21.771
Are you ever gonna let that go?

17:24.375 --> 17:26.643
Olivia, did you just say
you're dating Ben Wheeler?

17:26.679 --> 17:27.678
Yeah. Why?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.613
Because I just started
dating Ben Wheeler.

17:29.648 --> 17:32.649
Wow! Looks like Ben screwed
everyone's lives up again.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.551
Classic Ben. Let's go, babe.

17:34.587 --> 17:35.652
Danny, what are you doing here?

17:35.688 --> 17:37.487
Oh, hey, Olivia.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.423
Amanda. I didn't realize, um...

17:39.458 --> 17:41.825
I'm just going to, um... I'm so thirsty.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.527
I see what's going on here.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.861
You do?

17:44.897 --> 17:47.497
Yeah. You're covering up for your dad.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.899
Bonnie, I swear. I didn't'
get anyone pregnant.

17:48.934 --> 17:49.900
I did!

17:49.935 --> 17:52.703
Oh! Ow. You!

17:52.738 --> 17:53.870
I got you pregnant.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.741
And Dr. Marsh is my mom's doc.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.644
I lied to you because I
knew he was a good doctor,

18:00.679 --> 18:02.654
and I wanted you to
have the best because

18:02.680 --> 18:04.606
you're carrying our
baby and I love you.

18:05.684 --> 18:06.717
Brad,

18:06.752 --> 18:09.653
Mom doesn't want to go away for a year.

18:09.688 --> 18:12.422
She already missed one
grandchild being born,

18:12.458 --> 18:13.523
she doesn't want to miss another.

18:13.559 --> 18:14.591
Is this true?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.460
You don't want to leave?

18:16.495 --> 18:17.861
Look, honey, I love you.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.496
But I am not a rough-it kind of a gal.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.866
Okay? And instead of a year...

18:22.901 --> 18:25.836
how about we just go
away for a long weekend?

18:25.871 --> 18:27.437
Oh.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.773
Oh, and, honey, thanks
for trying to help.

18:29.808 --> 18:32.643
I'm sorry I put so much pressure on you.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.778
Yeah. I'm sorry too.

18:34.813 --> 18:35.812
Come on.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.781
Oh!

18:39.618 --> 18:40.717
Ooh, look, everyone's
happy now. Let's go.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.686
Not so fast, Wheeler.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.588
Isn't there something you wanna say?

18:45.658 --> 18:47.557
All right, I'll try the truth.

18:47.593 --> 18:50.560
Uh, look... I ran into
this girl a few months ago.

18:50.596 --> 18:51.662
"L" something.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.563
Her name is Elle, you idiot.

18:53.599 --> 18:54.631
E-L-L-E.

18:55.701 --> 18:58.502
No way! Elle.

18:58.537 --> 18:59.836
That's perfect.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.473
Okay, fine. I'm a dog.

19:03.509 --> 19:06.443
I slept with you, and you,

19:06.478 --> 19:07.844
and I think her a long time ago.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.715
But we had some fun, right?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.016
And it wasn't all my fault.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.686
I mean, you were a little
desperate and you are very flirty.

19:16.722 --> 19:17.754
And the bottom line is,

19:17.790 --> 19:19.790
I did who I had to do to get to Elle.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.725
And I'll do it again.

19:22.761 --> 19:23.760
Let's hug it out?

19:26.432 --> 19:27.764
Elle doesn't live here anymore.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.399
She moved away last month.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.768
Right.

19:31.804 --> 19:32.869
I don't suppose you'd
give me her number?

19:32.905 --> 19:34.838
- Or her address? No? Okay.
- Absolutely not.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.408
You know what? I'm gonna find her.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.743
I have to.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.713
'Cause we're meant to be.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.848
I'm out.

19:46.752 --> 19:47.884
That's the alley, that's the alley.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.885
Aw, come on.

19:51.824 --> 19:52.889
Oh, hey, guys.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.858
Oh, Elle, when did you get here?

19:54.893 --> 19:56.727
Oh, just a few minutes ago.

19:56.762 --> 19:57.861
Why? Did I miss anything?

19:57.896 --> 19:59.896
Let's just say you dodged a bullet.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.801
We don't actually know
anyone here, do we?

20:04.837 --> 20:06.870
- No.
- You grab the booze, you grab the snacks.

20:06.905 --> 20:08.739
Go, go. Go, go, go.

20:15.755 --> 20:17.722
Come on, just give me a hint about LA.

20:18.864 --> 20:19.996
Was it embarrassing?

20:21.162 --> 20:23.195
Can I find it on the Internet?

20:23.231 --> 20:24.296
Do you need help burying a body? Like...

20:26.300 --> 20:28.100
I will never tell you.

20:31.305 --> 20:33.072
He told you, didn't he?

20:33.107 --> 20:34.106
Yes.

20:35.209 --> 20:36.208
How bad is it?

20:36.244 --> 20:37.243
Bad.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.277
Are you gonna tell me?

20:38.312 --> 20:39.311
No.

20:39.347 --> 20:42.214
Are you gonna save it to
blackmail Tucker later?

20:42.250 --> 20:43.315
Yes.

20:44.352 --> 20:46.152
I've never been so proud.

20:47.305 --> 20:53.273
