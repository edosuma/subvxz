00:02.166 --> 00:03.917
You guys can complain all you want,

00:04.000 --> 00:06.125
but I had a really good time
at the Seaford fair.

00:06.208 --> 00:07.750
We're just saying
the fair's gone downhill.

00:07.834 --> 00:09.959
I mean, the baby elephant
was just a shaved dog

00:10.041 --> 00:11.458
with a hose taped to its nose.

00:12.667 --> 00:15.000
Hey, Jerry,
where'd you get that cool tie-dyed shirt?

00:15.083 --> 00:15.917
Oh, I didn't.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.542
I just got on the spinning cups with Rudy
after he had nine flavors of Italian ice.

00:20.041 --> 00:20.917
It was eight.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.500
That ninth color's the chili dog
I had for breakfast.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.667
Hey, Jack, I need to ask a favor.

00:27.750 --> 00:31.166
You know that Seaford High news show
that I'm on that everyone talks about?

00:31.458 --> 00:32.417
Our school has a news show?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.625
- And you're on it?
- People talk about it?

00:35.417 --> 00:38.166
Yes, and I was hoping
that Jack could do the weather,

00:38.250 --> 00:39.542
uh, just for one day.

00:39.625 --> 00:40.750
- Why?
- Ugh.

00:40.834 --> 00:44.709
Well, we couldn't find anyone,
so our producer Albert had to fill in.

00:44.792 --> 00:46.375
He's not really the right guy for the job.

to be your weatherman,

00:56.500 --> 00:58.000
- I'll give it a shot.
- Oh, cool. Come on.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.625
Let's go into dojo
and practice for tomorrow.

00:59.709 --> 01:00.542
Okay.

01:14.250 --> 01:15.250

- Should we?

01:15.333 --> 01:16.625
I think we have to.

01:21.834 --> 01:24.959
I am never speaking
to any of you ever again!

01:28.583 --> 01:29.750
And I will tell you why!

01:31.208 --> 01:33.959
I invited you all to my birthday party,

01:34.083 --> 01:36.583
but no one come to celebrate the Phils.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.458
That's my fault, Phil. The...

01:38.542 --> 01:40.667
The fair was in town, we got free tickets,

01:40.750 --> 01:42.625
and I totally forgot it was your birthday.

01:43.333 --> 01:45.041
Uh, guys, how about we make it up to him?

01:45.667 --> 01:46.625
Uh...

01:51.792 --> 01:53.500

01:54.041 --> 01:55.000

01:57.458 --> 01:59.750
Yeah-- wait a minute.

02:00.375 --> 02:03.250
You're not pulling the yak fur
over my seeing balls.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.750
Look, Phil, we're really sorry--

02:05.875 --> 02:08.041
- Save it, sister!
- Okay.

02:09.375 --> 02:11.208
I thought you people
were like family to me.

02:11.625 --> 02:15.166
But what kind of family does this
to a man who just wants to be loved?

02:16.250 --> 02:17.625
Oh, I feel horrible, Phil.

02:17.709 --> 02:21.000
Look, I may have forgotten your birthday,
but I didn't forget to get you a present.

02:21.125 --> 02:22.000
Um...

02:24.250 --> 02:26.875
Look, uh, I got you
this beautiful tie-dyed t-shirt.

02:27.375 --> 02:28.542
Ugh.

02:28.625 --> 02:29.542
I don't want this.

03:20.583 --> 03:24.375
So we are gonna throw him
the best birthday party ever.

03:24.458 --> 03:26.583
All of his friends from the mall
are gonna come.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.709
Joan's even working on a Hachmachy dance.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.834
Okay, I did a little research.

03:30.917 --> 03:33.959
And the first thing you need
for a traditional Hachmachy birthday party

03:34.041 --> 03:36.542
is six gallons of tortoise pee.

03:36.625 --> 03:37.458
Got it.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.000
How do you have six gallons of--

03:41.083 --> 03:43.542
You get a tortoise
and you make him drink lots of water.

03:43.625 --> 03:44.917
It's called science, Kim.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.333
Okay, look at the present that I got him.

03:50.417 --> 03:54.667
It's a box for knickknacks
made out of 10,000 toothpicks.

03:54.750 --> 03:55.959
Oh, can I see that?

03:56.041 --> 03:56.959
Yeah, be very careful.

04:00.625 --> 04:01.709
You know what I got him?

04:02.208 --> 04:03.875
His mother. Yeah.

04:03.959 --> 04:05.959
She hasn't seen him
since he moved to Seaford.

04:06.041 --> 04:07.500
I'm flying her over.

04:07.583 --> 04:10.625
Mama Mima is gonna be the surprise
at the party.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.750
Best gift giver ever.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.583
Dude, how could you afford
to fly someone over from Hachmachistan?

04:16.667 --> 04:17.709
You know what, Jerry?

04:17.792 --> 04:18.750
Phil is my friend.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.750
And you cannot put a price tag
on friendship.

04:22.041 --> 04:25.250

05:38.792 --> 05:40.375
Okay, everybody, they're almost here.

05:40.458 --> 05:42.333
I told Jerry
to bring Phil here blindfolded.

05:48.375 --> 05:51.583
Jerry, Phil was supposed
to have the blindfold on.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.417
Oh, that makes so much more sense.

15 to 15 1/2.

how to use a teleprompter.

There's my big, strong man
working his heart out.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.792
Here's your credit card.

11:35.667 --> 11:36.625
Oh.

11:37.333 --> 11:40.125
Why did you take my credit card, dear?

11:40.208 --> 11:42.125
Oh, well, because I knew you'd want me

11:42.208 --> 11:46.417
to have this necklace
for our anniversary, dear.

11:47.333 --> 11:52.625
I'm surprised you didn't get
matching earrings to go with it, dear!

11:53.333 --> 11:55.917
Well, that's a great idea...

11:56.417 --> 11:57.458
dear.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.750
Oh, my father was wrong about you.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.166
Oh...

12:04.125 --> 12:06.625
Can you believe we have to keep up
this act until Mima leaves?

12:06.709 --> 12:07.542
Hey!

12:08.083 --> 12:10.041
My daddy don't pay you to flap your lips.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.125
Go move a futon.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.875
You know, Phil, I'm so ashamed.

12:17.291 --> 12:19.417
A little part of me thought you were lying

12:19.500 --> 12:22.291
when you didn't send me
a picture of your family.

12:23.125 --> 12:27.083
But I see you have built a beautiful,
wonderful life.

12:27.166 --> 12:29.458
And given me a beautiful grandchild.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.792
I gave you two.

12:32.291 --> 12:35.041
Oh, right, the girl.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.375
What is wrong with the Kims?

12:37.458 --> 12:38.250
Yeah.

12:39.041 --> 12:41.208
What is wrong with the Kims?

12:41.250 --> 12:44.250
Oh, where do I start?

12:45.250 --> 12:46.709
Your pasty skin!

12:47.208 --> 12:48.542
Your tortoise lips!

12:49.041 --> 12:51.500
Your puny plucked eyebrows!

12:52.000 --> 12:54.542
You're going to grow old and alone.

12:55.959 --> 13:00.709
That is why I'm going to give you
Hachmachy makeover.

13:00.834 --> 13:03.083
-
- Wait, wait.

13:04.208 --> 13:05.625
Where is she taking me, dad?

13:06.250 --> 13:08.375
Dad? Daddy!

13:11.542 --> 13:13.709
All right, guys. We're going live in 30.

13:16.208 --> 13:19.500
You know, the news is about actual news,

13:19.583 --> 13:21.041
not about how good you look.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.542
News is about ratings.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.250
You got to give the people what they want.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.208
And they want this guy.

13:34.917 --> 13:37.125
What they want is a great story,

13:37.208 --> 13:39.875
like that time I went undercover
in the cafeteria

13:39.959 --> 13:41.458
for my piece about a sneezy chef.

13:41.834 --> 13:44.291
No one will ever forget snots
in your tots.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.417
Everyone forgot that story.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.083
- It was a dumb story.
- It was a great story.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.166
-
- Three, two, one!

13:50.083 --> 13:51.750
<i>- I'm Jack Brewer.
- And I'm Milton Krupnik.</i>

13:51.834 --> 13:53.208
<i>And here's our top story.</i>

13:53.875 --> 13:56.583
<i>The school nurse reports that wedgies
are down by ten percent</i>

13:56.667 --> 14:00.083
<i>due to the recent expulsion
of Glen "The Ripper" Daniels.</i>

14:00.667 --> 14:02.333
<i>- And here with our next story--</i>
-

14:02.417 --> 14:03.250
Big hair!

14:03.375 --> 14:05.208
Big, big hair!

14:05.250 --> 14:06.583
- Whoo-hoo.
- What? No.

14:07.792 --> 14:08.959
<i>You did this!</i>

14:09.250 --> 14:10.250
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

14:10.333 --> 14:12.583
<i>Uh, we're on air. Try and be professional.</i>

14:13.875 --> 14:15.709
<i>And on to our next news segment,</i>

14:16.458 --> 14:17.375
<i>Inside Seaford.</i>

14:19.208 --> 14:23.458
I will be testing the pH level
of our Seaford High drinking water

14:23.542 --> 14:25.166
with one little drop of--

14:33.000 --> 14:34.208
<i>That's it!</i>

14:34.875 --> 14:36.458
No! No! No!

14:36.542 --> 14:37.750
-
- Let me go!

14:37.834 --> 14:39.166
No! No! No!

14:39.250 --> 14:40.458
<i>No, no, no.</i>

14:45.083 --> 14:46.417
<i>No!</i>

14:47.250 --> 14:48.458
And we're out!

14:49.083 --> 14:50.959
Oh, that was great, guys.

14:51.041 --> 14:54.166
I'm gonna go talk to the principal
about getting more time added to the show.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.208
Did he just say we were great?

14:56.625 --> 14:58.458
Uh, we just had an on-air brawl.

14:59.875 --> 15:02.792
Why would he want us to fight
if all he cares about is...

15:04.000 --> 15:05.250
Ratings.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.166
That's it. Let's tell him we quit.

15:07.250 --> 15:08.083
No.

15:08.667 --> 15:10.291
I think we should do one more broadcast.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.625
<i>♪ Kicking it with you! ♪</i>

15:15.917 --> 15:17.542
You did not?

15:17.625 --> 15:21.917
Oh! Mama Mima, you're hilarious.

15:22.375 --> 15:24.583
- What she say?
- I have no idea.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.041
Wait till you see what I have done
with the Kims.

15:28.458 --> 15:32.250
I took a lump of ugly and turned it
into a lump of less ugly.

15:33.125 --> 15:34.250
Kims!

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Oh.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.500
Have you ever seen anything
like her before?

15:43.583 --> 15:46.375
Well, there's a horror movie
where this creature crawled out of the--

15:46.458 --> 15:47.333
Rudy!

15:49.125 --> 15:50.583
This hat is ridiculous.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.500
Oh, Phil, I'm so proud of you.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.250
I couldn't be happier.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.208
I've made a decision.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.875
I'm not going back to Hachmachistan.

16:03.959 --> 16:06.417
I'm going to stay here with Phil

16:06.500 --> 16:09.750
and his beautiful family forever.

16:13.917 --> 16:16.208
Oh, I think they fainted with the joy.

16:16.250 --> 16:19.333
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it.

16:19.417 --> 16:20.667
You know what, mother?

16:20.750 --> 16:22.667
Let's celebrate. Huh?

16:24.834 --> 16:28.417
We're going to the most
expensive restaurant in town.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.667
- Phil would want that.
Oh...

16:33.834 --> 16:35.542
<i>What a great story, Milton.</i>

16:36.041 --> 16:38.500
<i>A dog with dentures, wow.</i>

16:38.583 --> 16:40.875
<i>His bark really is worse than his bite.</i>

16:42.875 --> 16:44.333
Why are they getting along?

16:44.375 --> 16:46.208
<i>Yeah, we'd like to take a break
from our normal routine</i>

16:46.250 --> 16:47.417
<i>and shake things up a bit.</i>

16:47.500 --> 16:49.709
<i>Oh, shake it! Shake it up, Jack.</i>

16:50.166 --> 16:51.208
<i>We want you to meet a man</i>

16:51.250 --> 16:53.208
<i>who doesn't quite get
the credit he deserves.</i>

16:53.250 --> 16:54.750
<i>Our producer, Albert.</i>

16:54.834 --> 16:55.792
<i>Come on up here, Albert.</i>

16:55.875 --> 16:57.542
What?

16:59.458 --> 17:02.208
<i>Why? What are you doing?
What are you doing?</i>

17:03.125 --> 17:05.667
<i>Our ratings have tripled
in the last few days</i>

17:05.750 --> 17:07.625
<i>and it's all because of Albert.</i>

17:07.709 --> 17:10.417
Well, I don't know. I mean...

17:10.834 --> 17:11.959
<i>I'm pretty good.</i>

17:13.458 --> 17:14.834
Wait, what am I standing in?

17:14.917 --> 17:18.291
- Ooh.
- Oh, that's just some quick-dry cement.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.792
See, Albert understands

17:19.875 --> 17:22.625
that ratings can come
from making people look like fools.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.959
- No.
- So we thought you'd help us

17:24.041 --> 17:25.291
with the weather.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.375
But I don't want to help you
with the weather.

17:27.375 --> 17:29.250
Oh, look at that.

17:29.709 --> 17:32.250
You're on TV and we didn't even give you
a chance to fix your hair.

17:32.333 --> 17:33.166
-
- Oh!

17:33.250 --> 17:35.333
Why don't you use some
of the hair volumizer you gave me?

17:35.417 --> 17:36.917
- No, no, no.
- No? Why?

17:37.041 --> 17:39.917
- No, no, no.
- Look at that.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
No!

17:42.083 --> 17:43.750
<i>No!</i>

17:44.959 --> 17:46.667
Here's the weather for today.

17:46.750 --> 17:48.834
We're expecting hail...

17:48.917 --> 17:54.375
No, no!

17:55.125 --> 17:56.667
And gale force winds...

17:56.750 --> 17:57.583
- Ooh.
No.

17:57.834 --> 17:58.667
Help.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.000
-
Oh.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.166
Whoo!

18:01.250 --> 18:02.375
- Whoo!
- Oh!

18:02.458 --> 18:03.417
Oh!

18:03.959 --> 18:06.250
And a torrential downpour.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.500
Poor little feller.

18:13.583 --> 18:14.458
Oh, look at that.

18:14.542 --> 18:15.375
Nice.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.458
You guys, we can do this.

18:19.542 --> 18:20.834
She's an old woman.

18:20.917 --> 18:24.333
We just have to keep up this life
for another 20 or 30 years.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.583
Phil, come on.
You have to tell her the truth.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.500
- Why?
- Look at me!

18:30.542 --> 18:31.750
No, she's right, Phil.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.041
Dude, we have to get back
to our real lives.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.709
No, you can't make me go back!

18:36.792 --> 18:39.291
I don't want to live
in a world without faux fur.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.667
Okay, fine.

18:43.458 --> 18:44.792
I will tell Mama the truth.

18:45.333 --> 18:48.208
Jerry, Kims!

18:48.291 --> 18:51.250
Tonight, we dine like kings.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.709
We're going to the beach

18:52.792 --> 18:55.750
to collect the seaweed
and the washed-up pip-pips.

18:56.709 --> 18:57.875
I don't know what a pip-pip is,

18:57.959 --> 18:59.834
but I'm telling you,
I am not gonna eat one.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.667
No, Mama...

19:04.458 --> 19:05.709
there's something I must tell you.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.125
These people, they're not...

19:10.750 --> 19:12.291
My family is...

19:12.375 --> 19:14.750
Phil, what are you trying to say?

19:15.333 --> 19:17.291
Joan is not my wife.

19:17.375 --> 19:18.542
No!

19:18.625 --> 19:21.250
- Jerry is not my son!
- No!

19:21.333 --> 19:23.375
And Kim is not my daughter.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.041
No!

19:25.125 --> 19:27.583
Body could be happier about the Kim news.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.583
I am a failure, Mama.

19:31.792 --> 19:33.250
This is not my family.

19:33.792 --> 19:36.166
- I do not own this store.
-

19:36.250 --> 19:39.542
I'm but a simple falafel flinger.

19:39.959 --> 19:41.417
Falafel!

19:43.458 --> 19:44.750
You're a disgrace!

19:45.208 --> 19:46.208
Pack your things!

19:46.250 --> 19:48.667
We're going back to Hachmachistan.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.166
You don't have family here.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.208
Goodbye, everybody.

19:55.792 --> 19:57.125
I will miss you.

19:57.208 --> 19:58.166
Wait.

19:59.041 --> 20:00.834
Yes, he does have a family.

20:01.750 --> 20:02.667
Us.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.250
But you're just a pretend family.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.959
We love each other. That's not pretend.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.208
And we're always there for each other.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.834
And that's the best kind of family
that a man can have.

20:14.458 --> 20:17.083
You did this because you love my Phil?

20:17.208 --> 20:18.041
Yeah.

20:19.041 --> 20:20.083
And we'd do it again.

20:20.667 --> 20:21.792
Hang on, hon.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.500
Okay, I'm wearing yak slacks

20:25.583 --> 20:27.959
and I have two giant caterpillars
walking across my face.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.917
Maybe you people are right.

20:31.959 --> 20:35.208
The important thing is that
my Phil be happy.

20:36.041 --> 20:38.417
And you people make him happy.

20:39.625 --> 20:42.291
- Everybody stand together.
- Why?

20:42.375 --> 20:45.625
I want to take a picture
of my son's family.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.750
Hey, Kim, move a little bit to the left.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.250
A little more.

20:54.709 --> 20:56.250
A little more.

20:56.542 --> 20:58.166
You don't want me in the picture,
do you?

20:58.250 --> 21:01.125
You are very smart
for such a hideous creature.

21:08.709 --> 21:09.750
- Good.
- Hup!

21:09.834 --> 21:11.375
- A little more extension.
- Hup!

21:11.458 --> 21:13.166
Awesome, that's great, guys.
Let's take a break.

21:14.375 --> 21:17.500
So, Kim, any word on when your eyebrows
will be back to normal?

21:20.750 --> 21:22.375
My doctor doesn't know how Mima did it.

21:22.458 --> 21:24.542
But he thinks that it'll be
about three weeks.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.000
They're really not even--

21:26.792 --> 21:28.125
I mean, they're hardly--

21:28.750 --> 21:29.875
Three weeks?

21:56.834 --> 21:57.750
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.083 --> 22:02.917
<i>Yes!</i>
