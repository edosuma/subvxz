00:45.041 --> 00:46.241
- Merry Christmas.
- You, too.

00:52.548 --> 00:53.613
Thanks.

00:57.452 --> 00:59.217
Oh. Excuse me.

01:02.088 --> 01:03.053
Got him.

01:04.589 --> 01:08.357
Lieutenant, you were right.
He was in the toy store...

01:08.359 --> 01:10.092
<i>...And he bought
a stuffed animal.</i>

01:10.094 --> 01:11.935
He's on his way
to see a new girlfriend.

01:13.163 --> 01:15.129
How can you be so sure?

01:15.131 --> 01:17.231
I don't have to see her.
I know Weaver.

01:18.801 --> 01:21.401
She's about 5'7 ", 5'8",

01:21.403 --> 01:23.369
blonde, not the platinum kind.

01:23.371 --> 01:25.337
She's about 125 pounds.

01:26.740 --> 01:28.406
Probably a college graduate.

01:28.408 --> 01:30.741
Definitely well-read.

01:30.743 --> 01:33.143
Weaver likes to talk, and he
wants someone who can talk back.

01:40.552 --> 01:43.386
You see that Teddy bear he's carrying?
What about it?

01:43.388 --> 01:45.454
Murder comes next.
He's in the wooing phase.

01:47.458 --> 01:50.659
I spent the last two years of my life
one step behind this son-of-a-bitch.

01:50.661 --> 01:52.661
He's a piece of shit. Don't
you two ever forget it.

01:54.264 --> 01:56.397
Look, lieutenant, this isn't L.A.
so just stay cool.

02:03.238 --> 02:04.604
Hold it.
Hold up, guys.

02:24.457 --> 02:26.156
Coming!

02:27.826 --> 02:30.793
Merry Christmas, Laura.

02:30.795 --> 02:34.296
Oh, Ryan, he's so cute.
Yeah, I thought so, too.

02:34.298 --> 02:36.531
I'm sorry about not
getting it wrapped.

02:36.533 --> 02:38.299
I... I was just in such a
rush to get it to you.

02:38.301 --> 02:39.541
No, you didn't have to wrap it.

02:40.169 --> 02:41.134
I love it.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.602
And I love you.

02:45.839 --> 02:47.738
Come here.

02:49.608 --> 02:50.673
Sit down.

02:55.246 --> 02:56.778
You're the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.545
You know that?

03:01.583 --> 03:02.648
Give me a kiss.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.884
Down! Get down!
Police!

03:06.886 --> 03:08.752
On the floor with your
hands behind your back!

03:08.754 --> 03:09.919
Give 'em to me.

03:11.856 --> 03:13.522
Give 'em to me.

03:13.524 --> 03:14.789
Roll him over.
Over!

03:14.791 --> 03:15.890
What's going on?

03:19.362 --> 03:20.527
Take it easy. Easy.

03:20.529 --> 03:21.694
Hello, Weaver.

03:24.398 --> 03:26.231
What are you doing?

03:26.233 --> 03:28.700
Now, what the hell's
the matter with you?

03:28.702 --> 03:30.468
5'7" and blonde, huh?

03:30.470 --> 03:32.169
That guy's
out of his mind.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.051
Come on, get him on his feet.
Come on.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.571
Merry Christmas.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.540
Oh. Hi, ray.

03:38.542 --> 03:40.575
I was, uh, expecting Stephen.

03:41.811 --> 03:43.677
Mr. helfet, told me
to give you this.

03:46.248 --> 03:47.413
Where is he?

03:48.649 --> 03:49.814
Ah, he didn't stay.

03:53.586 --> 03:54.718
Thank you, ray.

04:11.768 --> 04:14.502
I did not get out of control.
They're exaggerating.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.671
I did not beat him.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.206
- I restrained him.
- <i> We don't need another problem with you,</i>

04:20.208 --> 04:21.507
<i>I've got enough to deal with here.
</i> No...

04:21.509 --> 04:23.242
there will not be
an incident on the plane.

04:23.244 --> 04:24.843
<i>Well, that's because
you're not going.</i>

04:24.845 --> 04:26.878
<i>You're not going, hines.</i>
Alright. Alright, alright.

04:26.880 --> 04:27.845
I'm coming back.

04:37.688 --> 04:39.304
What are you,
my chaperon?

04:39.305 --> 04:40.921
After what happened today?
Yeah, lieutenant, I am.

04:40.924 --> 04:42.790
Lieutenant?

04:43.826 --> 04:44.724
Is that thanks to me?

04:45.593 --> 04:47.726
I'm going back
to L.A.

04:47.728 --> 04:49.208
I'll be waiting
for you on the tarmac.

04:50.496 --> 04:52.562
They won't let you fly
back with me, will they?

04:52.564 --> 04:54.397
I don't want to
wait around.

04:54.399 --> 04:55.564
You're always lying.

04:57.267 --> 04:58.599
You know, I think a little
honesty would be good

04:58.601 --> 05:00.241
for our relationship
right now. Don't you?

05:01.703 --> 05:03.669
You should tell me something.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.605
How'd you plant that
evidence in my car?

05:06.607 --> 05:09.307
If it were true, what
difference would it make?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.989
Knowing what you did?
I mean, you're a cop.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.743
How... How do you look at
yourself in the mirror?

05:13.745 --> 05:14.944
I like what I see.

05:15.846 --> 05:17.207
I'm proud I got you
off the street.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.645
Is it fame?

05:19.914 --> 05:22.347
Is that why you screwed me?

05:22.349 --> 05:24.415
Did you wanna solve one big
case before you retired?

05:24.417 --> 05:26.717
You got your promotion. You
gonna write a book now?

05:26.719 --> 05:27.918
You didn't even make
the evening news.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.953
See? You watched.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.322
I mean, this must
really burn your ass.

05:32.324 --> 05:33.756
You go through all of this, you
track me down for two years

05:33.758 --> 05:35.324
and you still get no respect.

05:35.326 --> 05:36.825
L.A.'s a tough place
for a killer.

05:37.861 --> 05:39.327
You have a lot of
competition out there.

05:39.329 --> 05:40.609
You should've
killed a celebrity.

05:42.965 --> 05:44.497
I never killed anybody.

05:46.033 --> 05:47.365
And you know it.

05:56.975 --> 05:58.341
Yeah, right.

05:58.343 --> 06:01.510
Wow, look at this.

06:01.512 --> 06:03.712
Boy, somebody really got
into the Christmas spirit.

06:03.714 --> 06:05.880
It's so pretty.

06:05.882 --> 06:08.449
Two crews made a bet over who
could do the best decorations.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.884
- And this was the loser.
- You're kidding.

06:10.886 --> 06:13.486
I'm so junior, I get all
the holiday flights.

06:13.488 --> 06:14.987
Now, come on.
Only five passengers,

06:14.989 --> 06:16.588
and we get to spend
Christmas in L.A.

06:16.590 --> 06:18.690
Now, wait a minute. We
may have our hands full.

06:18.692 --> 06:20.658
Yep, it's now 11 passengers.

06:20.660 --> 06:22.026
Ooh, six more. It's
still a piece of cake.

06:22.028 --> 06:24.727
No. Six men.
Faa 2-14.

06:41.911 --> 06:43.777
Estimated flight time
to L.A. is

06:43.779 --> 06:45.345
five hours, 49 minutes.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.480
Could get a little
bumpy along the way.

06:48.482 --> 06:50.782
So, who are these prisoners
we're transporting?

06:50.784 --> 06:52.683
I don't know. One of
them is a bank robber.

06:52.685 --> 06:54.785
The other one is the uh,

06:54.787 --> 06:56.753
"lonely heart strangler."

06:56.755 --> 06:58.795
Leave it to, Uncle Sam to
cast a cloud on Christmas.

06:59.724 --> 07:00.823
Hi.

07:02.092 --> 07:03.391
No.

07:04.827 --> 07:06.393
When did that happen?

07:06.395 --> 07:07.494
I don't know.

07:34.856 --> 07:36.689
Did you flatten my coat?

07:36.691 --> 07:38.123
I didn't flatten your...
No, no, no, no.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.591
Sit there. I wanna
sit on the aisle.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.059
I like to sit on the aisle.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.427
I should sit on the aisle.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.895
Please, don't argue.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.950
Teri, I... I don't
want to hear you say

08:05.952 --> 08:07.151
you were right all along.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.520
You said I was
rushing in London.

08:10.522 --> 08:13.489
No, you know, look.

08:13.491 --> 08:15.657
At least you didn't do what I
did and marry the wrong guy

08:15.659 --> 08:17.492
after a five-minute
romance.

08:17.494 --> 08:19.126
You did that?
I did it twice.

08:20.662 --> 08:22.061
I mean, I am just now
getting over the need

08:22.063 --> 08:23.495
to make men happy.

08:23.497 --> 08:25.196
It's pathetic.

08:25.198 --> 08:27.598
You've got so much time. You've got
your whole career ahead of you.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.032
You know? Really.

08:30.068 --> 08:31.834
Just wait for the right
guy to come along.

08:49.586 --> 08:52.553
Whoa, whoa.
Faa regulations.

08:52.555 --> 08:54.755
Please step off the vehicle.
I'll stow it for you.

08:56.892 --> 08:58.858
You live in L.A.?
My dad does.

09:06.767 --> 09:08.900
Seats and lavatories clear.
Coming on board, now.

09:33.559 --> 09:35.225
Merry Christmas.

09:35.227 --> 09:37.193
Okay, you're four rows
down on the left.

09:39.096 --> 09:42.263
I need a 28.8 Jack
immediately after takeoff.

09:42.265 --> 09:43.597
Is that a problem?

10:04.085 --> 10:06.685
Hey, captain.

10:06.687 --> 10:09.120
You're late. I specifically
requested you be here

10:09.122 --> 10:11.088
before the other
passengers were on board.

10:11.090 --> 10:13.890
It was my understanding
the flight was almost empty.

10:13.892 --> 10:14.957
I'm sorry.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.660
I think you'll find
everything in order there.

10:18.994 --> 10:19.959
Okay.

10:21.028 --> 10:22.794
Four weapons. That's it?
Nothing else?

10:24.798 --> 10:26.197
I carry
a .38 backup.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.166
It's not on the manifest.

10:29.168 --> 10:30.769
Most pilots don't have
a problem with it.

10:30.835 --> 10:32.701
I do.

10:32.703 --> 10:34.202
If it's not on the manifest, it
has to ride up front with me.

10:34.204 --> 10:35.724
I'm afraid you'll
have to hand it over.

10:46.782 --> 10:47.981
What are you looking at?

10:49.050 --> 10:51.283
Shut up.

10:51.285 --> 10:55.120
I want the restraints kept
on for the entire flight.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.088
We weren't planning
on taking them off.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.355
Okay, let's go.

10:58.357 --> 10:59.322
Come on.

11:08.766 --> 11:10.866
Don't fucking push me, man.
Come on.

11:10.868 --> 11:13.869
Stubbs, any more verbal
abuse, and I will gag you.

11:21.244 --> 11:22.309
Hi.

11:33.055 --> 11:35.055
Excuse me, miss.
What's the movie?

11:35.057 --> 11:36.389
<i>It's a wonderful life.</i>

11:36.391 --> 11:37.957
Really? What's
the name of that song

11:37.959 --> 11:39.175
that Jimmy Stewart was singing...
Come on.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.392
With Donna Reed? They were
walking down... Let's go.

11:40.394 --> 11:41.726
Main street.

11:53.205 --> 11:54.904
Boo!

11:54.906 --> 11:55.971
Cool it.

12:01.878 --> 12:05.279
Yeah, that place was great.
I loved it there...

12:05.281 --> 12:06.446
medium long shot.
I mean, you never push...

12:06.448 --> 12:08.214
Right here.
Uh-huh.

12:08.216 --> 12:10.216
Middle seat. Middle seat.
Can I take this one?

12:10.218 --> 12:11.858
Don't worry about the coat.
Just sit down.

12:16.724 --> 12:18.690
Hey, you know, you really
shouldn't do that.

12:18.692 --> 12:20.291
Shouldn't do what? Make eye
contact with these guys.

12:20.293 --> 12:21.959
You never know what
they could be up to.

12:21.961 --> 12:23.961
What did they do?

12:23.963 --> 12:25.829
You know the guy with the dark hair?
The one who likes you?

12:25.831 --> 12:27.397
He's a convicted serial killer.

12:27.399 --> 12:29.265
Mmm-hmm.
Are you kidding?

12:29.267 --> 12:31.033
He raped and killed five girls,

12:31.035 --> 12:32.801
one of the maintenance
men told me.

12:32.803 --> 12:34.903
Plus, he said that some cops,
'cause his cousin's one,

12:34.905 --> 12:36.971
said that Weaver couldn't
have done it. Hmm.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.239
A perfect argument for
capital punishment, huh?

12:39.241 --> 12:41.274
He doesn't look like
a serial killer.

12:41.276 --> 12:43.976
Did you ever see Ted Bundy?
What he looked like?

12:43.978 --> 12:46.418
He was a real charmer. Mark harmon
played him in the TV movie.

12:59.459 --> 13:02.620
<i>Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the eastern
portion of New York state.</i>

13:03.829 --> 13:06.129
What's that?

13:06.131 --> 13:08.251
If it's not on the manifest,
it's not on the airplane.

13:09.967 --> 13:12.434
I swear, those guys have seen
too many <i>dirty Harry</i> movies.

13:12.436 --> 13:13.368
Checklist.

13:26.015 --> 13:28.115
- Doors?
- Closed.

13:28.117 --> 13:29.282
Cabin preparation?
Complete.

13:29.984 --> 13:31.049
Call for pushback.

13:32.318 --> 13:34.451
This one always sticks.

13:34.453 --> 13:37.454
<i>Season's greetings
from the cockpit.</i>

13:37.456 --> 13:40.957
<i>We will fortunately be leaving New
York before this latest blizzard hits.</i>

13:40.959 --> 13:43.326
<i>We still face a rough
ride due to weather.</i>

13:43.328 --> 13:45.761
<i>Flight time is five
hours and 49 minutes.</i>

13:45.763 --> 13:48.497
<i>It's about 20 minutes
longer than usual.</i>

13:48.499 --> 13:51.366
<i>The latest Los Angeles weather is
overcast skies with rain showers.</i>

<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

13:54.037 --> 13:55.903

14:44.443 --> 14:48.511
<i>Flight attendants, please
be seated for takeoff.</i>

14:48.513 --> 14:51.514
<i>Trans con 47 heavy, condition
on hold, runway 31 left.</i>

14:51.516 --> 14:53.048
I hate these icy takeoffs.

15:02.592 --> 15:04.058
Armed.
Checklist is complete.

15:06.328 --> 15:08.995
<i>You're cleared for takeoff,
trans con 47 heavy.</i>

15:08.997 --> 15:10.963
Trans con
47 rolling.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.566
Powers good, we have
four stable engines.

15:41.092 --> 15:42.958
<i>Trans con 47,
contact departure.</i>

15:42.960 --> 15:44.426
<i>Have a good day.</i>

15:44.428 --> 15:45.894
<i>Roger,
trans con 47.</i>

15:59.174 --> 16:00.373
Thank you.

16:06.580 --> 16:09.180
I'll flip you for lower business.
That's your section.

16:09.182 --> 16:11.515
Yeah, normally, but
today's not a normal day.

16:11.517 --> 16:14.050
Those prisoners
give me the creeps.

16:14.052 --> 16:16.252
I would've thought you'd take
them as a sympathetic gesture.

16:16.254 --> 16:17.453
Yeah, well.

16:19.290 --> 16:21.456
I'm not as patient
as you are.

16:22.592 --> 16:23.891
Heads or tails?

16:24.393 --> 16:25.325
Heads.

16:32.633 --> 16:34.132
It'll take your mind
off Stephen.

16:35.001 --> 16:36.033
Thanks a lot.

16:45.009 --> 16:46.169
What would you like to drink?

16:48.111 --> 16:49.143
Heineken.

16:55.684 --> 16:56.683
Merry Christmas.

17:03.158 --> 17:04.924
Can I get you
something to drink?

17:04.925 --> 17:06.157
Yeah.
Orange juice, please.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.094
What would you like?

17:13.499 --> 17:14.365
What do you like?
Weaver.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.232
I'll have the
complimentary champagne.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.434
Like hell you will. Okay,
I'll have a bloody Mary.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.435
Weaver. Hold the vodka, the
celery and the tabasco.

17:21.571 --> 17:23.811
If you wanted a tomato juice,
why didn't you just say so?

17:24.641 --> 17:25.673
What's your name?
Hey!

17:28.310 --> 17:29.375
Teri.

17:30.711 --> 17:32.711
I'll have whatever
you like, Teri. Okay?

17:35.282 --> 17:37.382
Apple juice. That would be great.
Thank you.

17:37.384 --> 17:39.050
Make that two.
Thank you.

17:43.056 --> 17:44.789
Coke, please.

17:44.791 --> 17:47.658
Okay, and what would you like?

17:47.660 --> 17:48.741
I'd like to nail you, baby.

17:52.097 --> 17:55.331
That's two strikes, stubbs.
One more, and I will gag you.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.533
You got a short fuse, marshal.

17:58.802 --> 18:00.835
It's gonna be a long flight.

18:00.837 --> 18:03.270
Sorry about that, miss. He
won't be bothering you again.

18:05.374 --> 18:06.439
Sir?

18:07.475 --> 18:08.707
Just bring me a coke.

18:12.813 --> 18:14.679
<i>Buffalo gals!</i>
Huh?

18:14.681 --> 18:16.514
That's the song from
<i>it's a wonderful life.</i>

18:16.516 --> 18:18.449
<i>¶ Buffalo gals, won't you
come out tonight?</i>

18:18.451 --> 18:20.350
<i>¶ Come out tonight
come out tonight ¶</i>

18:23.755 --> 18:25.715
that was... that was...
That was driving me crazy.

18:27.325 --> 18:29.425
I dated a criminal once.
Only once?

18:30.628 --> 18:32.694
He owned a used car lot.

18:32.696 --> 18:35.263
They busted him for turning
back the odometers.

18:35.265 --> 18:37.732
How could you trust
someone like that?

18:37.734 --> 18:38.866
I figured I did the same thing

18:38.868 --> 18:40.334
when I told him I was 21.

18:43.806 --> 18:45.639
<i>Trans con 47,
heavy radar contact</i>

18:45.641 --> 18:48.375
<i>out at 7,000
cleared to 16,000 feet.</i>

18:48.377 --> 18:50.310
<i>Roger,
out at 7,000 to 16,000.</i>

18:57.518 --> 18:58.750
She is really cute.

19:00.553 --> 19:01.752
Yeah, just your type.

19:04.723 --> 19:07.123
I know it's meaningless
to mention,

19:07.125 --> 19:09.285
but a detective planted the
evidence that convicted me.

19:10.461 --> 19:11.893
You're innocent?
Yes, I am.

19:13.162 --> 19:14.227
Duly noted.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.365
Are you married?

19:21.335 --> 19:23.655
Yeah, but I don't wear a ring
because I don't like jewelry.

19:24.504 --> 19:26.203
You don't have to
defend yourself to me.

19:27.406 --> 19:29.205
Was that a tough sell
to your wife?

19:29.207 --> 19:30.727
The "I don't like
wearing jewelry" bit?

19:32.142 --> 19:35.643
Weaver, I know you'd like
to entertain yourself

19:35.645 --> 19:38.379
by engaging me in a
challenging conversation,

19:39.248 --> 19:40.880
but I like to read on a plane.

19:43.351 --> 19:45.250
Okay.
Duly noted.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.512
Hey, Aldo.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.034
I watched <i> inside edition</i> last night.
How come you wasn't on it?

20:18.450 --> 20:19.949
Because I was doing
Oprah instead.

20:20.518 --> 20:22.317
Ooh, Oprah!

20:22.319 --> 20:24.419
Didn't you get the message?
What message?

20:24.421 --> 20:25.420
<i>Hard copy</i> called.

20:26.856 --> 20:27.788
They did?

20:35.295 --> 20:36.294
Hines, here.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.209
Coffee.

20:52.211 --> 20:54.511
Ah great,
you read my mind.

20:56.314 --> 20:58.681
And served with
such style and grace.

20:58.683 --> 21:00.816
Well, that's easy
after a zillion Miles.

21:00.818 --> 21:02.884
Cream and sugar.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.353
Skim milk and saccharine.

21:05.355 --> 21:08.556
Oh, God. Why do I
do this to myself?

21:08.558 --> 21:10.891
An old man trying to stay
fit in a young world.

21:12.794 --> 21:15.628
Hey, you're supposed
to stick up for me.

21:15.630 --> 21:18.330
I'm just looking at the clouds.
We heading into rain?

21:18.332 --> 21:20.298
Yeah, three heavies
in front of us.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.333
Reported serious turbulence.

21:22.335 --> 21:24.902
We're changing altitude and
course, try to vector around it.

21:24.904 --> 21:27.304
May put us 10 minutes
behind schedule or so.

21:27.306 --> 21:28.838
Better let the crew know.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.706
That is an easy order
on this flight.

21:47.257 --> 21:49.457
<i>Good evening, folks.
This is captain Powell.</i>

21:49.459 --> 21:51.926
<i>We've had reports of rough
air west of our position.</i>

21:51.928 --> 21:54.495
<i>We're gonna leave
the seat belt sign off</i>

21:54.497 --> 21:56.997
<i>for the time being as we try
to steer clear of the weather.</i>

21:56.999 --> 21:58.965
<i>However, I recommend that
while you're in your seats,</i>

21:58.967 --> 22:00.800
<i>keep your seatbelts
fastened at all times.</i>

22:05.873 --> 22:07.672
Yes? I'll have the
steak, please.

22:07.674 --> 22:08.839
Okay.

22:08.841 --> 22:10.907
Me, too.

22:10.909 --> 22:13.190
Ten to one, one of them has a
heart attack before we land.

22:15.479 --> 22:17.645
And what will you have?
What do you recommend?

22:18.781 --> 22:21.882
The Turkey.
Turkey?

22:21.884 --> 22:24.618
Okay. If that's what you like,
then that's what I'll have.

22:24.620 --> 22:25.652
You got it.

22:27.022 --> 22:28.354
But I'm a vegetarian.

22:31.591 --> 22:32.590
Turkey.

22:33.859 --> 22:35.391
- Okay.
- I'll have the same.

22:37.728 --> 22:38.888
And what would you like, sir?

22:40.797 --> 22:41.829
I've got to hit the head.

22:42.631 --> 22:43.752
You went before we took off.

22:45.066 --> 22:46.465
I gotta go again.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.400
Let him go in his pants.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.535
Come on, he's a human being.
He's not an animal.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.069
Turn around. Mind
your own business.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.972
It's your call, Marty,
but I say no.

22:56.974 --> 22:58.873
Give the man his dignity.
That's not right.

22:59.642 --> 23:01.541
Oh, damn!

23:01.543 --> 23:03.676
You gonna behave yourself?

23:03.678 --> 23:05.238
Well, what am I gonna
do with chains on?

23:06.346 --> 23:08.012
Marty, don't be soft.

23:08.014 --> 23:09.580
Don't tell me what to do, okay?

23:10.816 --> 23:11.981
You both go with him
and stay with him.

23:11.983 --> 23:13.782
Shit. Come on, man.

23:16.419 --> 23:18.585
Move it.
Here, Billy Bob.

23:18.587 --> 23:19.686
Alright.

23:25.626 --> 23:26.858
Good decision.
Shut up.

23:40.972 --> 23:41.971
Oh.

23:48.478 --> 23:50.344
You know, I could
go too, Marty.

23:53.048 --> 23:55.782
Okay, let's get this over with.

23:55.784 --> 23:57.416
We'll all go before we eat.
Come on.

23:58.752 --> 24:00.618
Thank you, but I'm
already potty trained.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.453
You're going
to the bathroom, Ryan.

24:02.455 --> 24:04.388
I don't have to go to the bathroom.
I'm fine.

24:04.390 --> 24:06.056
No, no. We're going,
so you're going.

24:06.725 --> 24:08.891
This is getting silly.

24:08.893 --> 24:10.826
Now, I assure you, when it's time
for my bodily functions to kick in,

24:10.828 --> 24:12.661
you'll be the second to know.

24:12.663 --> 24:14.362
We're disturbing the passengers
every time we do this,

24:14.364 --> 24:15.730
so we do it now!

24:15.732 --> 24:17.364
What passengers?

24:17.366 --> 24:19.866
I'm not gonna tell you
again, now let's go!

24:19.868 --> 24:21.066
Okay.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.004
That was the captain's
seatbelt warning.

24:27.006 --> 24:28.705
You will all have to
go back to your seats.

24:28.707 --> 24:30.540
Uh, we're not done here, ma'am.

24:30.542 --> 24:32.775
Well, from what I can see,
nobody has to do anything.

24:32.777 --> 24:35.137
Now, the seatbelt light is on,
and you all have to sit down.

24:36.746 --> 24:37.746
Okay, you heard the lady.

24:38.814 --> 24:39.846
Let's go.

24:40.615 --> 24:41.614
Let's go.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.956
Okay, come on, we gotta
get back to our seats.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.123
Be right out.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.090
Come on.

24:55.092 --> 24:57.092
I'm washing my hands.

24:57.094 --> 24:59.060
<i>This is captain Powell.</i>

24:59.062 --> 25:01.142
<i>We can expect a rough ride
for the next 15 minutes.</i>

25:01.497 --> 25:03.196
<i>We turned on the seatbelt sign,</i>

25:03.198 --> 25:04.697
<i>so please return to your seats</i>

25:04.699 --> 25:05.831
<i>and fasten your seatbelts.</i>

25:10.204 --> 25:11.603
What are you doing?

25:13.940 --> 25:15.539
Hillbilly Bob.
Ah!

25:25.283 --> 25:27.216
Sir, you're going to have
to take your seats now.

25:29.887 --> 25:31.887
Arquette, what's going on?

25:31.889 --> 25:33.154
Let's zip it up!

25:33.156 --> 25:34.221
Al!

25:42.730 --> 25:44.450
What is it, Marty?
Stay where you are, Mike.

25:45.732 --> 25:48.799
What was that?

25:54.539 --> 25:56.038
Everybody down!
Down!

25:56.040 --> 25:57.161
Weaver, don't get any ideas.

25:58.541 --> 26:00.661
I wouldn't think of it. The
seatbelt sign is still on.

26:07.148 --> 26:08.647
Let him go!

26:08.649 --> 26:12.150
Back off!
Back off!

26:12.152 --> 26:14.719
Now, you do what I tell
you or I'll kill him.

26:14.721 --> 26:15.886
You do and you're a dead man.

26:15.888 --> 26:17.053
I'm a dead man already.

26:17.755 --> 26:19.087
Let him go!
Marty...

26:20.924 --> 26:22.223
I'm sorry.

26:22.225 --> 26:23.857
This is really touching.

26:23.859 --> 26:25.158
You boys wanna hug each other?

26:27.828 --> 26:28.960
- Boo!
- Oh!

26:29.896 --> 26:31.929
Now, let's get it.

26:39.670 --> 26:40.669
Better check it out.

26:53.816 --> 26:55.115
Get back!

26:55.117 --> 26:56.438
Oh, my God!

27:06.760 --> 27:07.825
Bastard!

27:15.300 --> 27:17.266
<i>Cleveland, this is

Oh, God! No!

29:07.361 --> 29:10.028
Drop that gun!
No, marshal Dillon,

29:10.030 --> 29:11.195
you throw down your gun.

29:15.201 --> 29:16.934
Now you drop it,
or I'll do her.

29:18.237 --> 29:20.303
Stubbs let her go.

29:21.472 --> 29:22.632
Weaver, you stay out of this!

29:23.907 --> 29:25.473
Let her go!
Why?

29:27.176 --> 29:29.476
'Cause she give you
a fuckin' apple juice?

29:29.478 --> 29:31.444
Look, stubbs, you put a
bullet through her head,

29:31.446 --> 29:33.112
by the time it comes
out the other side,

29:33.114 --> 29:34.780
you're gonna have five in you.

29:34.782 --> 29:35.447
Is she okay?

29:37.184 --> 29:38.283
You alright?

29:38.852 --> 29:39.951
Bullshit!

29:40.386 --> 29:41.451
He won't shoot.

29:43.755 --> 29:45.988
He goes to the pistol
range five times a month

29:45.990 --> 29:48.390
and practices on cardboard versions
of you just for the hell of it.

29:48.392 --> 29:49.724
Look at his face.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.059
He wants to
take you out, stubbs.

29:55.029 --> 29:56.294
Let her go, stubbs.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.329
We need a hostage.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.231
Wake up, stubbs.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.066
We have a dozen
hostages already.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.400
We already have the upper hand.

30:04.402 --> 30:06.042
Don't do anything
stupid and give it back.

30:06.804 --> 30:07.969
Take it easy.

30:09.772 --> 30:10.804
Got it?

30:12.808 --> 30:15.441
Give me your gun. Fuck you.
Get him to drop his.

30:15.443 --> 30:19.111
Look, stubbs may be a moron,
but he's a professional.

30:19.113 --> 30:20.993
He's not gonna let her go
until you're disarmed.

30:22.082 --> 30:24.315
I'm not giving you my gun.
Why not?

30:25.318 --> 30:26.750
I already have one.

30:31.156 --> 30:33.189
I didn't see the need to wave
it around like an idiot.

30:33.191 --> 30:35.271
We seem to have a surplus
of idiots on board already.

30:38.229 --> 30:39.194
You okay?

30:40.497 --> 30:41.529
You sure?

30:44.467 --> 30:45.865
You lost, Douglas.

30:49.303 --> 30:51.336
I'll take that, cowboy.

30:51.338 --> 30:52.837
See, I am a professional.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.040
Stubbs,
listen to me...

30:55.841 --> 30:57.507
You're not so
tough now, are you?

30:57.509 --> 30:59.242
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Stubbs...

30:59.244 --> 31:01.877
Okay. Let's have us a little
skydiving exhibition.

31:01.879 --> 31:03.211
Stubbs,
what are you doing?

31:03.213 --> 31:04.946
This motherfucker's
getting out!

31:04.948 --> 31:06.781
You can't open the door during the...
Shut up, Weaver!

31:06.783 --> 31:07.663
Don't touch that door!

31:08.984 --> 31:10.550
Sit down sugar.

31:10.552 --> 31:13.019
Okay, asshole, open the door.

31:13.021 --> 31:14.021
Open it and say <i>Geronimo!</i>

31:15.389 --> 31:17.455
Well, all right, you
can say <i>crazy horse.</i>

31:17.457 --> 31:19.323
Just open the fucking door!

31:19.325 --> 31:20.565
No, she's telling you
the truth!

31:23.161 --> 31:25.094
One, two, three!

31:30.935 --> 31:32.034
Shit!

31:38.909 --> 31:39.908
Carl, get in...

31:41.544 --> 31:43.344
Betty, follow me. We have
to notify the pilot.

31:44.579 --> 31:46.478
Teri, get a pulse.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.046
Maggie, he's still breathing.
Okay. He's alive.

31:48.048 --> 31:49.447
Betty, get a blanket.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.981
Bleeding to stop. We've
got to get this open.

31:50.983 --> 31:52.916
What's the procedure here?

31:52.918 --> 31:54.984
The co-pilot would make
an emergency landing.

31:54.986 --> 31:56.919
I'll go to the flight deck.
You stay here and... I'll go.

31:56.921 --> 31:58.387
Pressure. Pressure. Wait
a minute, you can't go.

31:58.389 --> 31:59.738
You're not in charge. Look,
the most important thing

31:59.739 --> 32:01.088
you can do right now
is save this man's life.

32:01.091 --> 32:02.674
You're trained
for this, I'm not.

32:02.675 --> 32:04.258
Here, use this, now we've gotta
work together. Carl, go with him.

32:04.260 --> 32:05.826
Give me the keys
to the cockpit.

32:05.828 --> 32:07.194
Come on. Here you go, Maggie.

32:08.163 --> 32:10.296
It's fine.

32:10.298 --> 32:12.998
Could you help me with my wife?
Please? Please?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.561
It's weak,
but it's still going.

32:15.235 --> 32:17.134
Betty, get some water, please.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.576
We may need
some more blankets.

33:27.162 --> 33:30.329
Okay, we've lost all
communications with trans con 47.

33:30.331 --> 33:32.364
The plane took a steep dive
right after this recording,

33:32.366 --> 33:34.332
and it's since leveled off,
and seems to be steady.

33:34.334 --> 33:36.200
And it's off the airway, and...

33:36.202 --> 33:38.535
They've got major
storm activity ahead.

33:38.537 --> 33:40.303
We've identified
its location on the map,

33:40.305 --> 33:41.704
and the scanners are
indicating it's on autopilot.

33:41.706 --> 33:43.226
If it continues on
its present heading.

33:44.775 --> 33:46.307
All right. Notify the faa

33:55.782 --> 33:57.081
Go and check.
Okay.

34:04.389 --> 34:05.388
How is he?

34:08.126 --> 34:09.792
Oh, God.
This is bad.

34:10.460 --> 34:11.525
What did Ted say?

34:14.531 --> 34:16.764
He bumped his head
pretty bad, but he's okay.

34:16.766 --> 34:19.065
He's got clearance, and
we'll be on the ground

34:19.068 --> 34:20.399
in about
15-20 minutes.

34:25.705 --> 34:26.770
Jesus, God.

34:28.774 --> 34:30.039
What's the matter?

34:33.510 --> 34:34.592
Nothing.

34:34.592 --> 34:35.914
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:37.612 --> 34:38.678
<i>It's a wonderful life.</i>

34:45.585 --> 34:47.385
When we land,
what happens then?

34:48.688 --> 34:50.420
I'll be transferred
back to death row.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.090
And I'll wait
in my little cell,

34:54.092 --> 34:55.657
until however long it takes.

34:59.062 --> 35:00.342
Have you ever
been married, Teri?

35:04.466 --> 35:05.531
Teri?

35:06.333 --> 35:08.099
I was engaged.

35:08.101 --> 35:09.400
Was engaged?

35:09.402 --> 35:10.501
He broke it off.

35:11.504 --> 35:13.136
I always wanted to be married.

35:13.738 --> 35:14.570
Have a family...

35:15.306 --> 35:16.471
a kid.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.606
I always wanted a son.

35:22.712 --> 35:24.432
I don't know why I always
do this to myself.

35:33.188 --> 35:34.468
Did you do what
they say you did?

35:37.490 --> 35:38.622
No.

35:40.292 --> 35:42.558
No. I never
killed anyone.

35:43.861 --> 35:46.695
Because what you did up
here, is save lives.

35:46.697 --> 35:48.596
You saved my life.

35:48.598 --> 35:50.358
That's not going to mean
anything down there.

35:52.868 --> 35:55.348
In fact, they're going to think
I orchestrated the whole thing.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.403
It is gonna matter.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.204
You don't know the guy
that framed me, Teri.

36:00.173 --> 36:01.205
Who's that?

36:05.110 --> 36:06.375
They give you a last meal.

36:08.212 --> 36:10.332
But you know what? I'm gonna
ask them for a last song.

36:11.815 --> 36:14.182
Maybe if I keep a beat in my
head, it will distract me

36:14.184 --> 36:16.184
when they strap me in,
stick the needle in my arm

36:16.186 --> 36:17.485
and watch me die.

36:24.226 --> 36:25.258
We're not descending.

36:29.564 --> 36:31.044
Maybe he hasn't found
a good spot yet.

36:34.468 --> 36:35.533
I'm gonna go up and check.

36:36.335 --> 36:37.667
I'll be back down.

39:22.299 --> 39:23.731
Someone had to
have hit that switch.

39:23.733 --> 39:25.583
Maybe it wasn't
one of the pilots.

39:25.584 --> 39:27.434
Maybe someone hit it and didn't
know what they were doing.

39:27.436 --> 39:29.269

Who the hell is flying

now the plane is on autopilot.

39:30.772 --> 39:32.271
So just leave this to us.

39:32.273 --> 39:33.605
Maybe they're trying to
communicate with us.

39:33.607 --> 39:35.039
Maybe they can
hear the broadcast

40:41.061 --> 40:43.061

41:33.466 --> 41:35.132
Both are dead.

41:35.134 --> 41:36.967
One of the prisoners escaped,
there was a shootout.

41:36.969 --> 41:39.636
All the marshals are dead.
It's a mess.

41:39.638 --> 41:42.639
What do I do? Teri, this

41:49.046 --> 41:50.206
<i>I'm up here
all alone.</i>

41:52.115 --> 41:54.682
Where is the rest of
the cabin crew?

41:54.684 --> 41:57.017
Down below with the other prisoner.
Ryan Weaver.

41:57.019 --> 41:58.651
Oh, my God. Try and
keep her calm.

41:58.653 --> 42:00.519
<i>Is this plane
going to crash?</i>

42:00.521 --> 42:02.988
No, you are not gonna crash.

42:02.990 --> 42:05.123
How do you know? <i>Because
we're monitoring</i>

42:05.125 --> 42:07.406
<i>your flight systems on the
central maintenance computer.</i>

42:08.995 --> 42:10.661
Yeah, but aren't we
heading into a storm?

42:10.663 --> 42:11.528
Don't we have to land
this plane right now?

42:12.264 --> 42:14.531
Teri, you've got to stay calm.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.372
<i>The most important thing for you to
do right now is to just stay calm.</i>

42:20.771 --> 42:21.736
<i>Okay...</i>

42:22.138 --> 42:23.637
I'm calm. Now what?

42:25.507 --> 42:28.140
Whatever you do, don't touch
the autopilot switch.

42:28.775 --> 42:30.841
I won't.

42:30.843 --> 42:32.943
Now the good news
is that you are flying

42:32.945 --> 42:35.065
the most sophisticated plane
that has ever been built.

42:35.146 --> 42:36.678
Great.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.646
But what if this
sophisticated plane

42:38.648 --> 42:40.147
flies into
an unsophisticated storm?

42:40.149 --> 42:42.048
<i>I hear you, Teri,</i>

42:42.050 --> 42:44.750
<i>but this plane has a
great track record.</i>

42:44.752 --> 42:47.519
Patch me through on a call to
the department of defense.

42:47.521 --> 42:48.853
Teri, we need you to stay calm.

42:51.724 --> 42:53.256
Yeah, calm.

42:54.025 --> 42:55.024
That's me.

43:00.664 --> 43:02.930
Hey Aldo, I gotta ask you a question.
Go ahead.

43:02.932 --> 43:04.932
Internal affairs has been
asking everybody whether

43:04.934 --> 43:06.254
we think you planted
the evidence.

43:07.536 --> 43:09.636
What did you tell 'em? Well, I said no.
Fuck no.

43:09.638 --> 43:11.671
I'd never tell 'em anything.
We're partners.

43:11.673 --> 43:13.873
But I'm just curious. Did
you plant the Teddy bear

43:13.875 --> 43:15.574
in Weaver's trunk?
You're damn right I did.

43:15.576 --> 43:17.642
Hey, hines!

43:17.644 --> 43:20.177
You got a telephone call! Sure.
Right after lunch.

43:20.179 --> 43:23.547
This is somebody out at the
crisis control center at lax.

43:23.549 --> 43:25.315
About Weaver.
Holy shit.

43:30.922 --> 43:33.088
<i>- Cmc to trans con.
- 47 heavy,</i>

43:33.090 --> 43:36.758
<i>flight level 350,
tracking 245 degrees.</i>

43:36.760 --> 43:40.628
<i>Approaching an area of severe
weather, enter 12:00, 200 Miles.</i>

43:40.630 --> 43:42.663
<i>At her present ground
speed, we show her entering</i>

43:42.665 --> 43:44.631
<i>the weather boundary
in two-three Miles.</i>

43:55.677 --> 43:56.909
I'd like you
back with the others.

43:56.911 --> 43:57.992
We're heading into a storm.

44:04.150 --> 44:06.270
And I'd like to hold on to
the gun, if you don't mind.

44:12.023 --> 44:13.063
You don't like me, do you?

44:15.192 --> 44:17.659
We were seated in your section,
but you made Teri wait on us.

44:18.595 --> 44:20.895
Didn't you?

44:20.897 --> 44:22.857
I thought it would take her
mind off her problems.

44:23.132 --> 44:24.064
What problems?

44:25.967 --> 44:27.633
She ended
a relationship recently.

44:29.837 --> 44:30.902
You're very smart.

44:31.804 --> 44:34.137
You didn't lie to me.

44:34.139 --> 44:35.371
You could tell I can tell
when somebody's lying,

44:35.373 --> 44:36.772
can't you, Maggie?

44:37.975 --> 44:39.107
Can't you, Maggie?

44:40.210 --> 44:41.709
You're sharp.
I noticed that.

44:43.245 --> 44:44.344
When?

44:47.248 --> 44:49.147
When did you notice it?

44:49.149 --> 44:51.249
Say it.
Don't be afraid.

44:52.151 --> 44:54.117
When? Just say it.

44:54.686 --> 44:55.751
When...

44:57.287 --> 44:58.986
you persuaded the other
agents to let the prisoner

44:58.988 --> 44:59.987
go to the bathroom.

45:01.223 --> 45:02.784
You were hoping
something might develop.

45:15.970 --> 45:17.002
Come on.

45:29.948 --> 45:31.847
Everybody back into the
crew bunk, please.

45:32.783 --> 45:34.349
What?
Everybody back

45:34.351 --> 45:36.417
into the crew bunk. Round them up.
Let's go.

45:36.419 --> 45:38.819
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

45:38.821 --> 45:40.941
Everybody back into the crew cabin.
Let's go. Come on.

45:42.391 --> 45:44.357
Come on.
Open the door, Maggie.

45:45.693 --> 45:46.992
Go open the door.

46:00.373 --> 46:01.772
Excuse me.

46:03.942 --> 46:05.342
We can't all fit in here!
We'll fit!

46:09.346 --> 46:10.878
All right. Keep moving.
Do something.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.279
Yeah, do something.

46:12.281 --> 46:13.413
Come on. Carl, do something.
You're the man.

46:13.415 --> 46:15.681
Tell him. Come on.

46:15.683 --> 46:17.282
Look, why don't we...
Ahhh!

46:19.219 --> 46:20.718
Get up.
Up the stairs.

46:21.787 --> 46:23.086
Okay! All right. All right.
Get up!

46:23.088 --> 46:24.053
Move!

46:24.955 --> 46:25.920
Give me the key.

46:34.463 --> 46:35.995
Those people did
nothing to hurt you.

46:36.931 --> 46:38.196
Why hurt them?

46:39.332 --> 46:40.653
What's your
favorite book, Maggie?

46:42.234 --> 46:45.168
I read Stephen king.

46:45.170 --> 46:47.837
You're alone a lot, aren't you?
What does that mean?

46:47.839 --> 46:49.371
Men don't look at you anymore.

46:49.373 --> 46:51.173
At least the ones
that you want.

46:51.175 --> 46:52.874
Your plumbing's
getting rusty.

46:52.876 --> 46:54.596
What do you have to look
forward to, Maggie?

46:56.912 --> 46:58.712
You might be able to go
for it, but then what?

46:59.346 --> 47:01.212
Can you kill?

47:01.214 --> 47:02.379
I started with
squirrels and birds.

47:02.381 --> 47:05.081
And then I moved on
to cats and girls.

47:05.083 --> 47:07.016
If you can kill me,
Maggie, go for it.

47:07.018 --> 47:08.150
What did you do with Teri?

47:09.486 --> 47:11.052
I think it's you that you
should be concerned with.

47:11.387 --> 47:12.452
Oh, God! No!

47:21.328 --> 47:23.594
I don't like you,
either, Maggie.

47:23.596 --> 47:25.162
You rub me
the wrong way.

47:31.336 --> 47:32.868
No!

47:33.170 --> 47:34.235
Get in!

48:23.114 --> 48:25.547
<i>Okay, Teri. We need to
get you up to speed</i>

48:25.549 --> 48:28.383
<i>on the operation of
the autoflight system,</i>

48:28.385 --> 48:32.052
<i>specifically how to use the autopilot,
before we can begin to discuss your descent.</i>

48:33.155 --> 48:34.954
Discuss my what?

48:34.956 --> 48:38.223
Teri, this is Rachel taper again.
Listen to me carefully.

48:38.225 --> 48:40.191
We think that you might be
able to land this plane

48:40.193 --> 48:42.026
if captain bowen
can talk you through it.

48:42.028 --> 48:44.028
I'm gonna go downstairs and get
the senior flight attendant.

48:44.030 --> 48:45.396
<i>Teri, no.</i>

48:45.398 --> 48:47.965
<i>Stay where you are.</i>
Why?

48:47.967 --> 48:50.067
<i>We need you
to program the autopilot</i>

48:50.069 --> 48:51.902
<i>so we can vector you around
the storm front ahead.</i>

48:51.904 --> 48:53.203
You've got a level six storm.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.239
Is that a six on a
scale from one to 10?

48:58.575 --> 49:00.074
<i>No, Teri.</i>

49:00.076 --> 49:01.542
On a scale of one to six.

49:03.646 --> 49:06.113
I'm going downstairs
to get Maggie.

49:06.115 --> 49:07.514
<i>She can handle this a
lot better than me.</i>

49:07.515 --> 49:08.914
Teri, no.
Stay where you are.

49:08.917 --> 49:10.283
<i>Do not leave the flight deck.</i>

49:10.285 --> 49:12.018
<i>We have to stay in contact.</i>

49:13.187 --> 49:14.186
Okay.

49:15.522 --> 49:16.687
I'm hanging.

49:20.526 --> 49:22.292
<i>Cmc, Minneapolis center.</i>

49:22.294 --> 49:25.495
<i>We show trans con 47
tracking jet airwave 60.</i>

49:25.497 --> 49:27.457
<i>She's maintaining her
preprogrammed flight path.</i>

49:42.443 --> 49:45.410
Yeah, Los Angeles
police department, please.

49:45.412 --> 49:46.377
<i>Is this an emergency?
</i> Yes, ma'am.

49:46.379 --> 49:47.244
Rampart division.

49:53.283 --> 49:55.350
<i>Lieutenant, I have a call for you.
</i> Yeah, I'll take it.

49:55.352 --> 49:57.193
Hines. <i>Don't you mean,
lieutenant hines?</i>

49:57.387 --> 49:59.120
How are you, Aldo?

50:00.556 --> 50:01.721
Weaver. What's
going on up there?

50:01.723 --> 50:04.190
Well, it wasn't a pretty scene.

50:04.192 --> 50:06.492
The other prisoner broke chains,
killed the four marshals,

50:06.494 --> 50:08.614
and I came in and saved the
day, and took care of him.

50:09.729 --> 50:10.994
<i>Aldo?</i>

50:10.996 --> 50:13.730
I heard you. <i>You
don't believe me?</i>

50:15.133 --> 50:16.499
Where's the pilot?

50:16.501 --> 50:18.667
They're dead.
Both of them.

50:19.670 --> 50:21.202
So, who's in charge up here?

50:22.004 --> 50:23.503
Me.

50:23.505 --> 50:25.605
LAPD. Come on through, sir.

50:25.607 --> 50:28.507
All right, Ryan.
You, you, wanna...

50:28.509 --> 50:31.109
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ryan. Now
Ryan and not Weaver, huh?

50:31.111 --> 50:32.591
Well, that's an
improvement, isn't it?

50:34.113 --> 50:35.212
You want to negotiate?

50:35.214 --> 50:36.580
No, I don't.

50:37.649 --> 50:40.116
I'm going to crash the plane.

50:40.118 --> 50:42.718
All right, look. If, if
you land, we can talk.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.986
Listen to me! Both
the pilots are dead.

50:44.988 --> 50:46.354
There's nobody
flying this plane.

50:46.356 --> 50:48.222
It's not gonna land.

50:48.224 --> 50:49.990
Now, what do you
want to talk about?

50:49.992 --> 50:52.625
What would you like
to talk about, hines?

50:52.627 --> 50:55.260
Do you wanna talk about
getting me a new trial? Huh?

50:55.262 --> 50:56.594
Do you want to talk
about you admitting

50:56.596 --> 50:58.329
that you planted
that evidence on me?

50:58.331 --> 51:00.431
<i>Do you wanna talk about that?</i>

51:00.433 --> 51:01.999
Maybe you'd like to talk to
somebody else. <i>Huh, Aldo?</i>

51:02.001 --> 51:04.234
The FBI's here.
Fuck the FBI!

51:04.236 --> 51:05.668
I'm talking to you.

51:07.204 --> 51:09.037
Where are you?

51:09.039 --> 51:10.304
Sin, can you get this call
on the overhead speaker?

51:10.306 --> 51:12.072
Lax.

51:12.074 --> 51:13.706
<i>Lax, that's perfect.</i>

51:13.708 --> 51:15.374
What, are you the
authority on me, now?

51:15.376 --> 51:16.742
Huh? Did you tell 'em
what I'm gonna do next?

51:16.744 --> 51:17.665
Why don't you tell 'em?

51:18.645 --> 51:20.128
What are you gonna do?

51:20.129 --> 51:21.612
<i>You're not listening
to me, hines.</i>

51:21.614 --> 51:23.113
You're not fucking
listening to me!

51:24.249 --> 51:26.382
You don't want to talk
to me, that's fine.

51:26.384 --> 51:27.583
Why don't you speak
to one of the FBI agents...

51:27.585 --> 51:29.185
<i>I'm not talking to anybody,</i>

51:29.186 --> 51:30.786
<i>because this plane
isn't coming down.</i>

51:30.787 --> 51:32.388
I'm 35,000 feet
in the air with no pilot.

51:32.389 --> 51:34.355
And even if I did get down,

51:34.357 --> 51:36.657
what would I have to
look forward to? Huh?

51:36.659 --> 51:38.025
All right, just,
just a second...

51:38.027 --> 51:39.760
You'd have fucking
20 guns at my head

51:39.761 --> 51:41.494
you'd bring me back to prison
to await my execution.

51:41.497 --> 51:43.196
No. I'm smarter
than that,

51:43.198 --> 51:45.097
and I'm fucking
smarter than you!

51:45.099 --> 51:46.431
<i>But we all know that, don't we?</i>

51:46.433 --> 51:47.565
We all know that because you

51:47.567 --> 51:48.732
couldn't get me
without cheating.

51:48.734 --> 51:50.533
You fucking cops
can't do anything

51:50.535 --> 51:52.568
without cheating
and without beating.

51:52.570 --> 51:54.503
Well, we caught you, didn't we?
No, you didn't get me!

51:54.505 --> 51:56.371
How did you get me, hines?
I'm up here.

51:56.373 --> 51:57.638
I'm up here, and
you're down there.

51:57.640 --> 52:00.040
How did you get me?
How did you get me?

52:00.042 --> 52:01.041
All right, calm down. <i>No,
I'm not gonna calm down!</i>

52:01.043 --> 52:02.342
You got me mad now!

52:02.344 --> 52:04.310
And I'm gonna go take
it out on somebody!

52:04.312 --> 52:06.211
And you know what, hines? Her
blood is gonna be on your hands.

52:06.213 --> 52:07.512
<i>You got that?</i>

52:07.514 --> 52:09.014
<i>Do you wanna be famous, Aldo?</i>

52:09.015 --> 52:10.515
<i>I'm gonna make you
so fucking famous,</i>

52:10.517 --> 52:11.782
you make sure you're
wearing something bright

52:11.784 --> 52:13.617
up on that tarmac,
because you're gonna be

52:13.619 --> 52:16.219
the first fucking cop to die
with a plane up his ass!

52:16.221 --> 52:17.153
Ha-ha...

52:27.229 --> 52:29.662
Hello, this is
trans con 47.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.433
What's happening? Are
you guys still there?

52:34.435 --> 52:36.475
Yeah, Teri, we're here. Just
give us a minute, okay?

52:37.638 --> 52:38.637
Okay.

52:54.220 --> 52:55.452
Fuck!

52:57.188 --> 52:58.320
Teri!

52:58.789 --> 52:59.721
Teri, open the door.

53:01.458 --> 53:02.857
<i>Teri! Open the door!</i>

53:02.858 --> 53:04.257
<i>Maggie's hurt, she fell
during the turbulence.</i>

53:04.260 --> 53:05.492
He's at the flight deck.

53:05.494 --> 53:06.726
What? She bashed her head,

53:06.728 --> 53:08.761
she's bleeding all over
the place, Teri.

53:08.763 --> 53:10.829
She keeps calling for
ya, she needs you.

53:10.831 --> 53:13.331
<i>Teri!</i> Teri, can you hear me?

53:13.333 --> 53:15.132
You've got to change your course.
We don't care...

53:15.134 --> 53:17.234
Teri! He's right
outside the door.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.102
He says my friend, the
flight attendant, is hurt.

53:19.104 --> 53:20.636
Teri, if you don't want
to come to the door,

53:20.638 --> 53:22.270
you gotta give me
the first aid kit.

53:22.272 --> 53:23.804
It's right next to the bunk.

53:23.806 --> 53:25.605
<i>Quick,
it's by the bunk!</i>

53:25.607 --> 53:27.273
<i>It's your
friend, Teri!</i>

53:27.275 --> 53:28.374
- Teri, this is hines.
- She's calling for you.

53:28.376 --> 53:30.243
<i>Lieutenant hines.</i>
She needs you.

53:30.244 --> 53:32.111
I'm the detective who arrested Weaver.
You cannot trust him.

53:32.113 --> 53:33.612
Hurry, Teri, hurry!

53:33.614 --> 53:35.374
Why didn't you tell me
the co-pilot was dead?

53:36.883 --> 53:38.816
Oh, he died.

53:38.818 --> 53:41.118
You knew he was dead.
No, no, I didn't, Teri.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.853
He was breathing when I
put him into the bunk.

53:42.855 --> 53:45.488
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I
did everything I could.

53:45.490 --> 53:47.656
This is bad.
This is bad.

53:47.658 --> 53:49.290
<i>- Whatever you do...</i>
- Teri!

53:49.292 --> 53:51.659
Do not open the door.

53:51.661 --> 53:53.460
Remember when I was trying
to tell you downstairs?

53:53.462 --> 53:55.695
You asked me what was
the, what was the matter?

53:55.697 --> 53:57.963
I was trying to find a way to
tell you how bad it was, Teri!

53:57.965 --> 53:59.597
Oh, God!

53:59.599 --> 54:01.432
You told me we were landing.

54:01.434 --> 54:03.400
I didn't know
what to say to you!

54:03.402 --> 54:05.935
Okay, Teri, I didn't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

54:05.937 --> 54:08.337
I mean, we've, we've
been through so much...

54:08.339 --> 54:11.740
Teri, you must program the autopilot.
I'm sorry, Teri.

54:11.742 --> 54:14.309
Teri, I'm sorry I lied to you.

54:14.311 --> 54:16.811
<i>Detect the motions
of the aircraft.</i>

54:16.813 --> 54:19.480
<i>Captain bowen needs to know
them to be able to help you.</i>

54:19.482 --> 54:21.014
<i>Do you understand?</i> Teri!
Maggie's hurt really bad.

54:21.016 --> 54:23.249
I'm going to do
everything I can.

54:23.251 --> 54:25.284
I don't know what to
do, though, Teri.

54:25.286 --> 54:26.685
<i>Teri!</i> She keeps calling for you.

54:26.687 --> 54:28.319
<i>Teri, are you there?</i>

54:28.321 --> 54:30.421
She's your friend.

54:30.423 --> 54:31.789
All right,
let her bleed.

54:31.791 --> 54:33.824
He says Maggie's hurt,
and it looks bad.

54:33.826 --> 54:36.026
Now, I don't care how
charming you think he is.

54:36.028 --> 54:38.361
He's a killer. <i>But
she is my friend.</i>

54:39.364 --> 54:40.796
All right, listen.

54:40.798 --> 54:42.831
<i>You could both be in danger.</i>

54:42.833 --> 54:44.799
<i>Get her to the flight
deck, but stay together.</i>

54:45.668 --> 54:47.567
Do you understand me?
Teri?

54:48.870 --> 54:50.035
<i>Teri, are you there?</i>

55:11.524 --> 55:12.656
Maggie?

55:47.087 --> 55:48.419
Maggie?

57:30.847 --> 57:31.779
Oh...

57:32.481 --> 57:33.546
Oh!

58:01.440 --> 58:02.505
Please stop.

58:07.144 --> 58:08.143
Please.

58:20.021 --> 58:21.620
<i>Trans con 47, this is...</i>

58:27.727 --> 58:28.992
<i>We will continue to monitor.</i>

58:33.098 --> 58:35.798
Trans con 47, this is trans
con crisis management center.

58:35.800 --> 58:37.132
Please respond.

58:39.102 --> 58:41.462
This is trans cons crisis
management center. Please respond.

58:43.172 --> 58:44.972
What's faa procedure in
a situation like this?

58:46.641 --> 58:49.174
I don't think there's ever been
a situation quite like this.

58:49.176 --> 58:51.742
It's got enough fuel to carry
it well beyond our coastline.

58:53.979 --> 58:55.211
If we were handling this,

58:55.213 --> 58:56.779
fewer lives would be
in jeopardy.

58:56.781 --> 58:58.046
Meaning what, lieutenant?

58:58.048 --> 58:59.981
Just what I said.

58:59.983 --> 59:01.515
Here's who you're dealing with.

59:01.517 --> 59:04.784
Male, Caucasian,
35, well-educated.

59:04.786 --> 59:06.018
Raised by his aunt who
mysteriously disappeared

59:06.020 --> 59:07.853
when he was 16.

59:07.855 --> 59:10.188
Has raped and
strangled five women,

59:10.190 --> 59:12.089
escaped while being transferred
to San Quentin two years ago,

59:12.091 --> 59:13.957
finally recaptured
two days ago.

59:13.959 --> 59:16.793
Was being transported to California
by four of your marshals.

59:16.795 --> 59:19.128
We already have a comprehensive
interfax profile, thank you.

59:19.130 --> 59:21.230
All right, guys. Can we focus
on the problem with the plane?

59:21.232 --> 59:23.665
We can't just let it crash
into downtown Los Angeles.

59:27.103 --> 59:29.970
Look, we've got
a level six storm ahead.

59:29.972 --> 59:31.271
It's a good chance
everything else

59:31.273 --> 59:32.993
will be a moot point
in about eight minutes.

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:02.597
Miss.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:05.933
Will this storm
delay our flight?

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.695
Are we going to be a
little late to the gate?

01:00:07.769 --> 01:00:08.868
Ooh.

01:00:10.605 --> 01:00:11.737
This is really
something, isn't it?

01:00:11.739 --> 01:00:12.804
It doesn't look too good.

01:00:13.773 --> 01:00:15.672
Where is everybody?

01:00:15.674 --> 01:00:18.107
What?
Where is everybody?

01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:21.143
You know, I was kind of
wondering that myself.

01:00:21.145 --> 01:00:22.777
I don't know.
They just disappeared.

01:00:22.779 --> 01:00:23.979
It's kind of creepy, isn't it?

01:00:26.782 --> 01:00:28.882
Why don't you sit down? Why?

01:00:28.884 --> 01:00:30.016
Why? Or stand
if you want.

01:00:31.185 --> 01:00:33.185
I don't like guns.

01:00:33.187 --> 01:00:34.786
So, let me ask you something,

01:00:34.788 --> 01:00:35.869
what's your favorite movie?

01:00:37.823 --> 01:00:39.789
What's my favorite movie?
Yeah, what...

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:42.324
Look, don't answer a question
with a question, all right?

01:00:42.326 --> 01:00:45.060
Only stupid people do that, and
you're obviously a very bright woman.

01:00:46.063 --> 01:00:47.328
Now, what's your
favorite movie?

01:00:50.232 --> 01:00:52.298
<i>Gone with the wind.
Gone with the wind.</i>

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.340
What's your favorite book?

01:00:54.168 --> 01:00:55.734
Is this a test?

01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:57.297
That's a question
with a question, Teri.

01:00:58.004 --> 01:00:59.670
Come on.

01:00:59.672 --> 01:01:02.139
I just want to
talk with you, okay?

01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:04.107
Now, what's your favorite book?

01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:07.009
<i>Gone with the wind.</i> Gone with...
so, it's book and movie.

01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:08.677
Wow, you're a real
romantic, huh?

01:01:11.581 --> 01:01:13.948
A romantic vegetarian
who likes apple juice.

01:01:21.323 --> 01:01:23.656
Did you have pets when
you were growing up?

01:01:23.658 --> 01:01:25.090
You like animals?

01:01:25.092 --> 01:01:27.792
Yeah, I had a dachshund.
Dachshund?

01:01:27.794 --> 01:01:29.093
You mean one of those
hot dog, dogs?

01:01:29.095 --> 01:01:30.594
Really?

01:01:30.596 --> 01:01:32.862
Why a dachshund?

01:01:32.864 --> 01:01:35.184
Because my father liked them,
and they were good with kids.

01:01:36.033 --> 01:01:37.732
Huh...

01:01:37.734 --> 01:01:39.300
Don't give me an attitude.
I'm just talking to you.

01:01:39.302 --> 01:01:40.342
So just talk to me normal.

01:01:40.869 --> 01:01:41.901
Okay?

01:01:41.903 --> 01:01:46.038
Gosh, a guy can't even have
a conversation these days.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.272
Now, did you like your father?

01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:48.740
Did you get along with him? Why?

01:01:50.376 --> 01:01:52.743
Yeah, we got along great.
Really?

01:01:52.745 --> 01:01:54.644
Is he still alive?
Are your parents alive?

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.346
Yeah.
Oh, good.

01:01:58.282 --> 01:01:59.247
Mine aren't.

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:07.488
Okay, um, here's a good one.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.324
All right. You're...
A condemned inmate

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:12.392
on death row
awaiting your execution.

01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:16.536
What five albums
would you pick?

01:02:18.332 --> 01:02:19.764
What would you wanna listen to?

01:02:20.733 --> 01:02:21.998
Or, just pick a song.

01:02:24.168 --> 01:02:26.234
I don't think I'd be
in the mood for music.

01:02:26.236 --> 01:02:28.916
Well, I don't think you know what
the fuck you'd be in the mood for.

01:02:29.271 --> 01:02:30.970
Would you?
No.

01:02:33.741 --> 01:02:35.501
What would you spend
your last moments doing?

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:41.378
Uh... I, I...

01:02:43.415 --> 01:02:45.848
I guess I'd like to see
my family and my friends.

01:02:46.951 --> 01:02:48.383
And what if they
couldn't be here?

01:02:51.321 --> 01:02:52.987
Then I'd wanna
make it right with God.

01:02:54.223 --> 01:02:56.156
What if you didn't
believe in God?

01:02:56.158 --> 01:02:57.891
I do believe in God.
You do?

01:02:59.327 --> 01:03:01.193
Do you believe
in capital punishment?

01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:02.861
What they're gonna do to me?

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.330
No.
No.

01:03:06.332 --> 01:03:09.066
You wouldn't, though, would ya?

01:03:09.068 --> 01:03:11.535
What does that mean? It's not who you are.
I mean, you're sweet.

01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:13.537
Dachshunds, <i>gone with the wind.</i>

01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:15.205
There's always hope,
isn't there?

01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:19.072
What about sex?

01:03:22.777 --> 01:03:24.443
Huh?

01:03:24.445 --> 01:03:26.085
Would you wanna have
sex on your last day?

01:03:28.015 --> 01:03:30.375
I'm not going to tell you that,
because that's too personal.

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:31.982
So is murder.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.019
Where's Maggie?

01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:38.421
Don't get adversarial
with me, Teri.

01:03:40.123 --> 01:03:41.288
You don't wanna do that.

01:03:42.791 --> 01:03:44.891
Talk to me, Teri.

01:03:44.893 --> 01:03:46.559
Talk to me. I haven't
had many partners.

01:03:48.329 --> 01:03:49.528
Don't lie to me.

01:03:54.067 --> 01:03:55.627
How old were you when
you first had sex?

01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:59.169
Eighteen and a half.

01:04:00.505 --> 01:04:02.004
Did you like it?

01:04:02.473 --> 01:04:03.505
Yeah.

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.106
Was that hard?

01:04:07.209 --> 01:04:08.374
No.
No.

01:04:10.111 --> 01:04:11.410
Just simple little questions.

01:04:13.247 --> 01:04:16.313
Don't get upset.
Everything's fine, okay?

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:20.050
Here.
Merry Christmas.

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.952
Okay?

01:04:24.155 --> 01:04:25.155
Maggie's in the bathroom.

01:04:28.592 --> 01:04:30.291
She's in the bathroom?
Yeah.

01:04:30.293 --> 01:04:32.059
Maggie's in the bathroom.

01:04:36.931 --> 01:04:37.963
Maggie?

01:04:39.433 --> 01:04:40.465
It must be the other one.

01:04:47.006 --> 01:04:48.372
Hey, come here.

01:04:59.582 --> 01:05:00.663
<i>¶ Dashing through the snow</i>

01:05:03.952 --> 01:05:05.217
<i>¶ laughing all the way... ¶</i>

01:05:05.219 --> 01:05:07.084
ah, ah, ah, no.
No, no, no, no! No!

01:05:19.296 --> 01:05:20.536
Come here!
Come here!

01:05:23.032 --> 01:05:24.531
Teri, come on!
Come on!

01:05:30.037 --> 01:05:31.102
Ahhh!

01:05:31.437 --> 01:05:32.502
Ahhh!

01:05:36.241 --> 01:05:38.975
<i>Please hold the oxygen mask
firmly against your face.</i>

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:40.338
<i>Place the strap
around your head.</i>

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.440
<i>Teri,
can you hear me?</i>

01:07:03.414 --> 01:07:06.648
Is this stuff un-fucking
amazing or what?

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:08.249
Teri, you are one
exciting first date!

01:07:13.956 --> 01:07:15.088
Are you all right!

01:07:20.228 --> 01:07:21.527
Teri, Teri, hold on!

01:07:33.604 --> 01:07:35.924
You're not having much luck
with men lately, are you, Teri?

01:07:39.676 --> 01:07:41.836
Please, I'll do anything you say.
I don't want to land.

01:07:43.178 --> 01:07:45.011
Got it? What about
everybody else?

01:07:45.013 --> 01:07:46.278
I know you've got
them somewhere.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.612
I don't want to
talk about them.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.117
I really like you, Teri.

01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:55.185
Then help me try and
land the plane.

01:07:55.187 --> 01:07:57.687
Listen to me!
Listen!

01:07:57.689 --> 01:07:59.522
Let's enjoy our time
together now, okay?

01:08:01.025 --> 01:08:04.092
Maybe we'll make it halfway
to Hawaii before we go down.

01:08:04.094 --> 01:08:05.494
That would be
romantic, wouldn't it?

01:08:07.062 --> 01:08:09.095
Wouldn't it?
No.

01:08:09.097 --> 01:08:10.497
No, I think that
would be a turnoff.

01:08:12.265 --> 01:08:13.785
Well, I didn't like
<i>gone with the wind.</i>

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:16.365
It's all subjective.

01:08:17.568 --> 01:08:19.401
You don't have to
force yourself on me.

01:08:24.107 --> 01:08:25.223
You can have me.

01:08:25.224 --> 01:08:26.340
If you help me land the plane

01:08:26.341 --> 01:08:28.008
and let everybody live.

01:08:36.718 --> 01:08:38.584
So I spare everyone,

01:08:38.586 --> 01:08:40.719
and you give me a bigger bang

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.720
than the one I get from
crashing the plane, is that it?

01:08:42.723 --> 01:08:44.055
Yeah.

01:08:44.657 --> 01:08:46.023
We have a deal?

01:08:48.594 --> 01:08:49.658
Want me?

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.401
Come on.

01:09:33.465 --> 01:09:36.265
You see, right here. This
is what it's all about.

01:09:36.267 --> 01:09:38.433
This is what's
it's about, look!

01:09:38.435 --> 01:09:39.667
It's the thrill of the kill for me.
Just like the passengers.

01:09:40.435 --> 01:09:43.236
I killed them all.

01:09:43.238 --> 01:09:45.438
Go up to the crew cabin and look.
They're all dead.

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:47.273
It's a beautiful sight, Teri.
Go look.

01:09:47.274 --> 01:09:48.573
It's time, Teri.

01:10:16.432 --> 01:10:19.466
<i>Teri, trans con crisis,

<i>If you read us, please come in.</i>

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:34.777
<i>Teri, this is trans con crisis
management center, please respond.</i>

01:10:34.779 --> 01:10:35.778
I'm back!

01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.413
<i>He wants
to crash the plane.</i>

01:10:38.415 --> 01:10:40.248
He wants to go out
in a blaze of glory!

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:43.217
He's crazy.
He killed Maggie!

01:10:43.219 --> 01:10:44.785
<i>I think he killed everybody.</i>

01:10:45.854 --> 01:10:47.720
Teri, do you have a weapon?

01:10:47.722 --> 01:10:50.322
Is there anything on the flight
deck you can defend yourself with?

01:10:50.856 --> 01:10:52.555
No...

01:10:52.557 --> 01:10:54.823
But he's gonna kill me.
That's what he wants.

01:10:54.825 --> 01:10:56.465
Teri, lock the door.
Try and barricade it.

01:10:58.227 --> 01:11:00.293
Get that fighter airborne now.
Yes, sir.

01:11:00.295 --> 01:11:01.594
We're gonna have to shoot
it down over the desert

01:11:01.596 --> 01:11:02.796
before it reaches Los Angeles.

01:11:02.797 --> 01:11:04.663
What?

01:11:04.665 --> 01:11:06.264
You can't shoot
a commercial airliner.

01:11:06.266 --> 01:11:07.982
Did you hear
what she just said?

01:11:07.983 --> 01:11:09.699
He wants to crash
the plane into lax.

01:11:09.702 --> 01:11:10.982
Now, do we have
any other option?

01:11:12.838 --> 01:11:15.271
Teri, our monitoring
equipment shows

01:11:15.273 --> 01:11:17.573

edge of the weather.</i>

01:11:17.575 --> 01:11:19.775
<i>We can begin to prep you for
the approach and descent now.</i>

01:11:19.777 --> 01:11:21.543
<i>Your controls are going to need</i>

<i>your immediate attention
and execution.</i>

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.680
<i>Please, we're all right here.</i>

<i>Cmc, trans con 47,

Excellent. Captain bowen's

01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:06.050
All right, Teri, I'm going

<i>who's gonna patch you

Teri! Oh! Oh!

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:13.822
Teri! That's it.

01:15:15.058 --> 01:15:16.991
Oh! I'm never flying
this airline again.

01:15:21.864 --> 01:15:24.197

you'll be glad to hear.

01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:36.105
It's just below
the glare shield.

01:15:36.107 --> 01:15:39.174
It says things like a stroke
t, arm, ias stroke mach...

01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:41.142
Got it.

01:15:42.678 --> 01:15:45.045
Good. Now, just to the
right of your knee,

01:15:45.047 --> 01:15:47.013
you'll see a small TV screen

01:15:47.015 --> 01:15:48.714
with buttons on either side.

01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:50.716
That's the cdu display.

01:15:50.718 --> 01:15:53.485
We'll use that to input data
into the flight computers.

01:15:53.487 --> 01:15:55.520
<i>What does it say now?</i>

01:15:55.522 --> 01:15:57.588

01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:21.849
Oh, my leg!

01:17:21.851 --> 01:17:23.383
On the left of the cdu screen,
do you see a list of words?

01:17:23.952 --> 01:17:24.984
Yes.

01:17:24.986 --> 01:17:28.120
<i>Those words
are navigation points</i>

01:17:28.122 --> 01:17:30.322
<i>that define your
path to the airport.</i>

01:17:30.324 --> 01:17:33.158
<i>Now, when you push

Not yet.

We're doing splendidly.

01:18:17.763 --> 01:18:19.229
Time to drop the landing gear.

01:18:19.231 --> 01:18:21.364

<i>The autopilots will do the

<i>Okay.</i>

01:20:10.115 --> 01:20:12.435
We believe that Weaver's gained
access to the avionics bay.

01:20:17.353 --> 01:20:19.052
What's the matter?

01:20:19.054 --> 01:20:20.787
He's in the avionics bay,

01:20:20.789 --> 01:20:22.522
screwing with the
circuitry of the plane.

01:20:22.524 --> 01:20:24.244
All right, what's the
worst that can happen?

01:20:24.892 --> 01:20:26.157
Disable the autopilot.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.859
And then what?

01:20:33.198 --> 01:20:35.431
Hines. <i>Did you wear
something bright?</i>

01:20:35.433 --> 01:20:37.966
Hold on.
You still there?

01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:40.501
Listen to me.
You listen to me.

01:20:40.503 --> 01:20:42.169
After you got me mad,

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:43.937
I went and killed the
crew and the passengers.

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:46.205
<i>So you better get
to confession.</i>

01:20:46.207 --> 01:20:49.241
The next sound you hear will be
me kicking out the autopilot.

01:20:49.243 --> 01:20:51.109
I'll see you soon! <i>Weaver.
Weaver, no!</i>

01:20:51.111 --> 01:20:52.276
<i>No! Weaver!</i>

01:20:57.082 --> 01:20:58.414
<i>Autopilot disengaged.</i>

01:21:00.184 --> 01:21:01.384
Oh, what happened?
I'm falling!

01:21:01.485 --> 01:21:03.151
Help me!

01:21:03.153 --> 01:21:06.120
Teri, you have to abort.
Repeat, abort!

01:21:06.122 --> 01:21:07.921
<i>Find the two go-around
switches on the floor,</i>

01:21:07.923 --> 01:21:10.323
<i>number two
and three thrust levers.</i>

01:21:10.325 --> 01:21:12.858
<i>- Push them.
- Twice. Repeat.</i>

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:15.193
<i>Find the two go-around
switches on the thrust levers.</i>

01:21:15.195 --> 01:21:17.828
I can't find them!
Yes, you can.

01:21:28.073 --> 01:21:30.173
She's gonna slam right
into the crowne Plaza.

01:21:30.175 --> 01:21:32.495
And if she clears that, she's
gonna hit the parking garage.

01:21:39.216 --> 01:21:40.315
I got 'em!

01:21:41.551 --> 01:21:43.317
- I got 'em!
<i>- Well done, Teri!</i>

01:21:48.457 --> 01:21:49.556
Damn it!

01:21:55.597 --> 01:21:58.497
<i>¶ 'Tis the season to be jolly</i>

01:21:58.499 --> 01:22:02.000
<i>¶ deck the halls
with boughs of holly</i>

01:22:02.002 --> 01:22:03.601
<i>¶ tra LA LA LA LA

01:22:03.603 --> 01:22:04.868
oh, my God!

01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:28.088
Oh, my God!

01:22:41.535 --> 01:22:43.134
She's cleared
the buildings.

01:22:43.136 --> 01:22:44.235
There's just one problem.

01:22:45.271 --> 01:22:46.637
I think it's a Ford.

01:22:52.511 --> 01:22:54.644
<i>Okay, Teri.</i>

01:22:54.646 --> 01:22:56.927
<i>The autopilot backup circuits
should have cycled by now.</i>

01:22:57.982 --> 01:22:59.948
Re-engage
autopilot switches.

01:23:02.452 --> 01:23:03.584
<i>Autopilot engaged.</i>

01:23:03.586 --> 01:23:04.651
Okay.

01:23:14.628 --> 01:23:17.095
Teri!

01:23:17.097 --> 01:23:19.397
<i>Cmc, flight tracking,
she's losing altitude.</i>

01:23:19.399 --> 01:23:21.399
<i>Three hundred feet
and sinking 500.</i>

01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:22.601
The truck's dragging her down.

01:23:28.439 --> 01:23:30.205
You're stalling.

01:23:30.207 --> 01:23:32.674
Teri, reach over to the
landing gear and pull it up.

01:23:32.676 --> 01:23:35.176
No, no! She can't retract
the landing gear.

01:23:35.178 --> 01:23:36.644
<i>There's a fucking
truck caught on it.</i>

01:23:36.646 --> 01:23:38.278
Forget the landing gear Teri.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.780
<i>Do not touch the landing gear.</i>

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:49.897
Push the thrust levers forward.

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:06.088
<i>- Cmc flight tracking, she's.
- 300 feet and climbing out.</i>

01:24:10.108 --> 01:24:11.828
Patch me through to that f-14.
Yes, sir.

01:24:19.383 --> 01:24:20.415
We can bring her back
around and try again.

01:24:20.417 --> 01:24:22.083
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:24:22.085 --> 01:24:24.652
You've got a 747 beat to hell
by level six turbulence,

01:24:24.654 --> 01:24:26.420
your flight crew is dead,

01:24:26.422 --> 01:24:29.089
you've got an armed, convicted
serial killer loose on board,

01:24:29.091 --> 01:24:30.790
eight passengers
have disappeared,

01:24:30.792 --> 01:24:32.558
and your stewardess is locked
in the goddamn cockpit.

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.825
Have I left anything out?

01:24:33.827 --> 01:24:34.987
Don't forget about the truck.

01:24:41.265 --> 01:24:43.732
What's going on?
Shouldn't I turn around?

01:24:43.734 --> 01:24:46.501
<i>Cmc, flight tracking
from moondog,</i>

01:24:46.503 --> 01:24:48.736
<i>I'm alongside her
at 9:00.</i>

01:24:48.738 --> 01:24:51.638
<i>In tight.
Distance, 200 feet.</i>

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.773
<i>Speed to match. Roger.
Hold your position.</i>

01:24:53.775 --> 01:24:55.174
What's that plane
doing out there?

01:24:59.146 --> 01:25:01.106
It's just there in case you
need assistance, Teri.

01:25:07.486 --> 01:25:09.319
How could it assist me?

01:25:09.321 --> 01:25:11.122
Just a precaution, Teri.
Don't worry about it.

01:25:14.792 --> 01:25:16.691
Yeah, well, fuck precaution
and fuck you!

01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:20.761
Okay.

01:25:30.238 --> 01:25:31.203
Okay, first.

01:25:53.392 --> 01:25:55.425
My God,
she's turning it around.

01:25:55.427 --> 01:25:56.559
How the fuck can
she turn it around?

01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:58.193
She's only a stewardess
for God's sake.

01:25:58.195 --> 01:25:59.394
She's a flight attendant.

01:26:05.167 --> 01:26:07.133
<i>Cmc, this is moondog.</i>

01:26:07.135 --> 01:26:09.668
<i>Trans con 4-7
coming left.</i>

01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:11.136
<i>Moondog maintaining position.</i>

01:26:12.539 --> 01:26:15.439
Okay, now listen up, everyone.

01:26:15.441 --> 01:26:18.575
I'm coming back into L.A.
with or without you.

01:26:18.577 --> 01:26:20.843
<i>So you got two choices here.</i>

01:26:20.845 --> 01:26:22.611
<i>You can either help me
land this plane</i>

01:26:22.613 --> 01:26:24.279
<i>or you can prepare
for one major crash.</i>

01:26:24.281 --> 01:26:25.480
Notify the
department of defense.

01:26:25.482 --> 01:26:27.315
This is it.
Yes, sir.

01:26:27.317 --> 01:26:29.483
Wing commander, this is
special agent sinclair.

01:26:29.485 --> 01:26:31.418
Arm your weapons
and prepare to fire.

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:34.254
I repeat, arm weapons
and prepare to fire.

01:26:34.256 --> 01:26:35.896
<i>Roger.
Breaking left to rejoin.</i>

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:45.798
The pilot?

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.800
<i>The pilot that was outside
my flight deck window?</i>

01:26:48.235 --> 01:26:50.168
I don't know
if you can hear me.

01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:52.236
I think you can.
I... I hope you can.

01:26:54.707 --> 01:26:56.540
If you're supposed
to stop this plane.

01:26:59.211 --> 01:27:00.851
I just hope you'll give
me another chance.

01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:05.213
<i>Target is in sight.</i>

01:27:05.215 --> 01:27:07.735
Just one more chance to show you
that I can get this thing down.

01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:15.253
Look, I know
it's only one life up here

01:27:16.789 --> 01:27:18.755
against, who knows how
many, if we crash.

01:27:22.527 --> 01:27:25.427
But I can make this happen,

01:27:25.429 --> 01:27:26.949
<i>if you'd just give me
another chance.</i>

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.700
<i>Weapon systems
are armed and ready.</i>

01:27:32.702 --> 01:27:34.234
<i>Standing by
for further instructions.</i>

01:27:37.973 --> 01:27:39.693
That's all I want
for Christmas.

01:27:43.611 --> 01:27:44.843
It's all I want forever.

01:27:57.356 --> 01:27:58.822
<i>Cmc from moondog.</i>

01:27:59.658 --> 01:28:01.457
<i>Reconfirm intent to fire.</i>

01:28:02.493 --> 01:28:04.493
Now, you listen to me, son.

01:28:04.495 --> 01:28:07.462
None of us wants
to splash that plane.

01:28:07.464 --> 01:28:10.665
But bringing her back in would be
risking thousands of other lives.

01:28:10.667 --> 01:28:12.467
Now, you fire on that
target, that's an order.

01:28:12.468 --> 01:28:15.235
My commander's gonna have
to authorize that, sir.

01:28:15.237 --> 01:28:17.003
Target's approaching
a populated area

01:28:17.005 --> 01:28:18.771
where debris
could hit the ground.

01:28:18.773 --> 01:28:20.472
That's why it's important
that you don't waste time.

01:28:20.474 --> 01:28:21.506
Fire on the target.

01:28:44.828 --> 01:28:46.561
Say your prayers.

01:28:47.597 --> 01:28:49.829
No, no, no!

01:28:56.469 --> 01:28:59.369
<i>Moondog, this is
commander rice.</i>

01:28:59.371 --> 01:29:00.669
<i>Fire. That's an order.</i>

01:29:04.007 --> 01:29:05.306
Fire!

01:29:31.731 --> 01:29:34.465
Come on, asshole, get up!
I dare you! Come on!

01:29:34.467 --> 01:29:36.699
No! No! No!

01:29:54.817 --> 01:29:55.949
You gotta love her!

01:30:00.454 --> 01:30:01.352
Oh, God.

01:30:18.936 --> 01:30:20.402
Ow!

01:30:44.027 --> 01:30:45.426
Oh, God!

01:30:47.696 --> 01:30:48.928
Come here, come here.

01:31:11.548 --> 01:31:12.880
You're not gonna kill me.

01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:16.549
You can't kill me.

01:31:16.551 --> 01:31:18.391
'Cause you don't believe
in capital punishment.

01:31:19.886 --> 01:31:21.385
I changed my mind.

01:32:02.759 --> 01:32:04.425
<i>Trans con 4-7,</i>

01:32:04.427 --> 01:32:06.560
<i>your excess baggage

01:32:06.562 --> 01:32:07.561
<i>You're clear to land.</i>

01:32:16.604 --> 01:32:18.003
Oh, perfect.

01:32:19.039 --> 01:32:20.471
<i>Rachel!</i>

01:32:20.473 --> 01:32:21.905
Yeah, I hear you, Teri.

01:32:21.907 --> 01:32:22.939
Weaver is dead.

01:32:24.108 --> 01:32:25.974
<i>Copy that?</i>

01:32:25.976 --> 01:32:27.809
Yeah, Teri, I hear you.

01:32:27.811 --> 01:32:29.644
<i>Can captain bowen
hear me?</i>

01:32:29.646 --> 01:32:32.146
<i>- I'm with you, Teri.
- Tell me what to do.</i>

01:32:32.148 --> 01:32:33.747
Find that arrival switch again.

01:32:35.217 --> 01:32:37.083
Okay.
Push it.

01:32:37.085 --> 01:32:38.717
I pushed it.

01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:41.253
Now push the button
beside runway 7, right,

01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:42.687
<i>and then execute.</i>

01:32:42.689 --> 01:32:46.290
Okay, lax arrival's up.
What next?

01:32:46.292 --> 01:32:49.660
Find those switches below the glare
shield labeled lnav and vnav.

01:32:49.662 --> 01:32:50.945
<i>Push them both.</i>

01:32:50.946 --> 01:32:52.229
<i>Just to the left
of those switches</i>

01:32:52.231 --> 01:32:54.064
<i>is the airspeed control knob.</i>

01:32:54.066 --> 01:32:56.833
Dial in the speed
of 1-8-0.

01:32:58.069 --> 01:32:59.068
Done.

01:33:00.104 --> 01:33:01.036
Speed brakes armed.

01:33:02.005 --> 01:33:04.772
Armed.
Reduce speed to 156.

01:33:04.774 --> 01:33:07.841
<i>1-5-6.</i>
Okay!

01:33:07.843 --> 01:33:10.677
All right, Teri, you're
locked onto the glidescope.

01:33:11.846 --> 01:33:13.207
<i>The plane should
land itself now.</i>

01:33:14.314 --> 01:33:17.648
Whatever happens
don't touch the controls.

01:33:18.817 --> 01:33:19.882
Got it!
