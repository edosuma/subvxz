WEBVTT

00:06.541 --> 00:08.164
So how's life as an empty nester?

00:08.188 --> 00:11.586
Oh, I miss Nicky a lot.

00:11.586 --> 00:13.831
Remember the first time
Nicky went away without us?

00:13.855 --> 00:15.617
Dance camp.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.610
You did not ask to meet

00:17.634 --> 00:20.235
to walk down memory lane, did you?

00:20.595 --> 00:24.074
Um, I, uh, I joined a charity

00:24.098 --> 00:27.177
that takes on innocence cases.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.545
Okay.

00:28.569 --> 00:31.715
And I'm representing a client
that's been in prison

00:31.739 --> 00:36.053
for five years, uh, and, uh,
Erin, he didn't do it.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.289
He tell you that?

00:38.313 --> 00:40.291
He was put away for murder

00:40.315 --> 00:42.426
based largely on an eyewitness account,

00:42.450 --> 00:44.395
and the witness recanted,

00:44.419 --> 00:47.331
and the, uh, the detective
who handled the case, um,

00:47.355 --> 00:51.502
let's just say this wasn't his
first questionable conviction.

00:51.526 --> 00:53.837
Well, doesn't sound like a slam dunk.

00:53.861 --> 00:56.106
Trust me, this kid was railroaded.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.958
Kid?

00:59.667 --> 01:02.579
Yeah, he was 20 when
he went into the system.

01:03.547 --> 01:05.849
Okay, so why are you coming to me?

01:06.842 --> 01:09.309
Because you're the one who put him away.

01:15.049 --> 01:17.861
- Leave him alone, yo.
- This yours?

01:17.885 --> 01:20.197
I asked you a question. Is this yours?

01:20.221 --> 01:21.765
No! Why don't y'all get out of here.

01:21.789 --> 01:22.967
Y'all should leave me be.

01:22.991 --> 01:24.969
- Hey, back it up.
- Yo, everybody, stay back!

01:24.993 --> 01:27.538
Look, all right,
we're not gonna bring you in.

01:27.562 --> 01:29.473
It's a summons instead.

01:29.497 --> 01:31.775
- A summons?
- Take this ticket, all right?

01:34.202 --> 01:35.279
That's what you get!

01:43.211 --> 01:44.888
Yo, let's just go to the car.

01:44.912 --> 01:46.890
All right?

01:46.914 --> 01:49.259
<i>And the officers did nothing?</i>

01:49.283 --> 01:51.695
That's right,
put their tail between their legs

01:51.719 --> 01:53.230
and got into their patrol car.

01:54.097 --> 01:56.267
They both got less than
a year on the job.

01:56.291 --> 01:58.902
- That's no excuse.
- No, it's just a fact, boss.

01:58.926 --> 02:01.382
We don't teach our officers
not to fight back.

02:01.406 --> 02:02.818
We're not teaching them that, boss,

02:02.842 --> 02:04.471
but it's open season on cops.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.971
They should've arrested the guy
on the spot.

02:06.995 --> 02:09.854
I agree with you, boss, but you
got the media and politicians

02:09.877 --> 02:11.389
hammering them every day

02:11.413 --> 02:12.957
with anti-cop stuff.

02:12.981 --> 02:14.058
It has an effect.

02:14.082 --> 02:15.927
And anyone complicit needs to be found,

02:15.951 --> 02:19.012
arrested, and charged with
everything we can throw at them.

02:19.036 --> 02:21.032
We can put out a Finest Message
to the troops.

02:21.056 --> 02:22.533
No, call a press conference.

02:22.557 --> 02:24.001
I'll write something up.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.560
I know what needs to be said.

02:32.302 --> 02:33.945
Hey, you headed home?

02:33.969 --> 02:36.013
Did you hear what happened
to DeNoon and Malone?

02:36.037 --> 02:38.015
Yeah, I just saw that
on my phone. They okay?

02:38.039 --> 02:39.717
No, they came back humiliated.

02:39.741 --> 02:42.386
- Who did it?
- C.O. put up a screen grab of the perp.

02:42.410 --> 02:43.754
The guy wasn't arrested?

02:43.778 --> 02:45.122
No, they did nothing.

02:45.146 --> 02:47.491
They just got in their RMP and left.

02:48.986 --> 02:50.127
<i>What do we got?</i>

02:50.151 --> 02:53.117
Miriam Harton, 85 years old,
was assaulted and robbed

02:53.161 --> 02:56.234
in the vestibule as she entered
the building with groceries.

02:56.258 --> 02:57.468
Perp came up from behind her,

02:57.492 --> 02:59.103
pushed her to the ground and stomped her.

02:59.127 --> 03:00.605
- Any witnesses?
- I wish.

03:00.629 --> 03:02.773
Looks like she may have broken
a hip and maybe some ribs.

03:02.797 --> 03:04.584
We should check to see
if there are any cameras...

03:04.608 --> 03:06.577
No, I-I already asked.
Super's working on it.

03:06.601 --> 03:08.379
My partner and I already
started a canvass.

03:08.403 --> 03:09.614
Mrs. Harton.

03:09.638 --> 03:12.250
Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Baez.

03:12.274 --> 03:14.852
Could you tell us about
the person who assaulted you?

03:14.876 --> 03:17.154
He... I thought he wanted to help.

03:17.178 --> 03:19.023
He opened the door for me,

03:19.047 --> 03:21.792
and then when I turned around, he hit me.

03:21.816 --> 03:23.394
It was a he, ma'am?

03:23.418 --> 03:25.943
My husband will be worried about me.

03:25.967 --> 03:28.065
Ma'am, it's really important
that you give us a description

03:28.089 --> 03:29.433
of the man who attacked you. Could you?

03:29.457 --> 03:31.872
My husband, my husband is waiting for me

03:31.896 --> 03:33.771
to come home with the groceries.

03:33.795 --> 03:36.107
- We need to get her checked out.
- Go ahead.

03:36.131 --> 03:38.976
Waiting for me.

03:41.336 --> 03:43.648
Hey. I want to talk to you.

03:43.672 --> 03:46.017
Hey, bro, hey, hey, bro,
I didn't do nothing, all right?

03:46.041 --> 03:47.942
You throw water on two police
officers earlier today?

03:47.966 --> 03:49.553
Hey, come on, man, throwing water

03:49.577 --> 03:51.668
ain't no crime. I ain't shoot nobody.

03:51.692 --> 03:53.596
- I'm talking to you.
- Man, all right, so what?

03:53.620 --> 03:55.226
Hey, you're under arrest.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.362
Man, you can't arrest me
for throwing water on no scum!

03:58.847 --> 04:00.665
It's just water, my dude. Yo...

04:04.759 --> 04:07.655
What the hell do you think
you're doing, you stupid dick?!

04:07.679 --> 04:10.374
It's just water, right?
Hands behind your back.

04:10.398 --> 04:12.310
Hey, bro, what?! Come on, man.

04:14.336 --> 04:16.079
- Yo, let him go!
- No, he got rights!

04:16.103 --> 04:17.515
What you taking him away for?

04:42.949 --> 04:45.127
I will not be taking questions.

04:45.151 --> 04:48.564
Earlier today, two police officers

04:48.588 --> 04:52.701
were attacked by perpetrators
who threw water at them

04:52.725 --> 04:55.938
while they were performing their duties.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.341
Anyone who throws water
on police officers,

04:59.365 --> 05:02.912
who throws objects at police officers,

05:02.936 --> 05:06.982
who impedes an officer's ability
to do his job,

05:07.006 --> 05:08.884
in any form,

05:08.908 --> 05:13.222
is breaking the law,
and that will not be tolerated.

05:13.246 --> 05:16.191
Anyone caught doing so will be arrested

05:16.215 --> 05:20.429
and charged to
the fullest extent of the law.

05:21.454 --> 05:26.602
I want to be crystal clear about this.

05:26.626 --> 05:30.706
I will never, never

05:30.730 --> 05:33.809
ask my officers to tolerate abuse.

05:33.833 --> 05:39.281
They put their life on the line
for every citizen in this city

05:39.305 --> 05:41.158
every day,

05:41.607 --> 05:44.219
and assaults and abuse

05:44.243 --> 05:48.090
against the uniform can and will be met

05:48.114 --> 05:49.658
by zero tolerance.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.226
That is all.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.966
What do you say to those people

05:56.990 --> 05:59.401
who take the position
that it's only water?

05:59.425 --> 06:01.470
Today it's a bucket of water,

06:01.494 --> 06:04.239
tomorrow it's a bucket
of "who knows what."

06:04.263 --> 06:06.542
Some might say that
the relationship between police

06:06.566 --> 06:09.511
and residents of predominantly
minority neighborhoods

06:09.535 --> 06:12.414
is strained and this incident is
a culmination of that breakdown.

06:13.295 --> 06:15.918
I'm sorry, that's all
we have time for today.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.459
Son of a bitch could've just robbed her.

06:23.483 --> 06:24.927
He didn't have to beat her up.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.274
Did you zoom in?

06:26.298 --> 06:28.246
I've been over this with a microscope.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.833
Well, it can't be his first time, then.

06:30.857 --> 06:33.428
No, that's exactly what I was thinking.

06:33.452 --> 06:36.472
There have been four reported incidents

06:36.496 --> 06:38.640
of robbery and assault
against senior citizens

06:38.664 --> 06:41.110
in this neighborhood
in the past three months.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.425
Same M.O.?

06:42.449 --> 06:46.181
Same exact M.O.
The perp targets an old person,

06:46.205 --> 06:48.050
he enters their building,
pretends to help them,

06:48.074 --> 06:49.218
then he knocks them down

06:49.242 --> 06:51.997
- and takes all their stuff.
- Any arrests?

06:52.021 --> 06:54.857
There was one arrest:
Matthew Greer, 32 years old.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.493
He's a delivery driver who was arrested

06:57.517 --> 07:00.796
for assaulting and robbing
an 85-year-old man.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.831
He broke two of his ribs and his jawbone.

07:02.855 --> 07:04.299
Where's this scumbag now?

07:04.323 --> 07:05.968
He was arrested,
but the charges were dropped,

07:05.992 --> 07:08.660
so now he's out on the streets.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.364
Not for long.

07:20.206 --> 07:21.884
Let me help you with that.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.208
Thank you.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.192
All right, hey, where's the money?

07:30.216 --> 07:32.161
- Where's the money? Where's the wallet?
- I don't have money.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.495
- You don't have money?
- I have nothing.

07:33.519 --> 07:34.719
So you got nothing?

07:35.888 --> 07:38.690
Damn it!

07:47.953 --> 07:49.987
Matthew Greer?

07:52.138 --> 07:53.382
He's not here.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.607
Must be out on a delivery.

07:57.616 --> 07:58.883
Reagan.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.559
- Matthew Greer?
- Detective Baez.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.360
This is Detective Reagan.
We have some questions for you.

08:05.384 --> 08:07.029
I'll move the truck.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.997
No, no, it's not about the truck.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.366
Someone, please,

08:11.390 --> 08:12.901
call 911!

08:12.925 --> 08:15.104
- It's Mr. Weissberg.
- Stay with him.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.730
He must've fallen.

08:17.296 --> 08:20.576
Police. Step aside, ma'am. Sir, you okay?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.911
- Someone pushed me.
- Who?

08:22.935 --> 08:25.047
- I don't know.
- Was it a guy with a hat?

08:25.071 --> 08:26.582
I don't know.

08:26.606 --> 08:27.950
Son of a bitch.

08:27.974 --> 08:29.751
Call an ambulance, ma'am, right now.

08:29.775 --> 08:30.919
Hurry up.

08:31.588 --> 08:33.889
- Hey!
- No. Oh, come on.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.289
- I don't have time for this. I'm sorry.
- Hey!

08:35.313 --> 08:37.392
- I'm sorry. I-I got to go.
- Get him. Get him off there.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.794
- Let's go. Out of the truck.
- Hey. Okay.

08:39.818 --> 08:40.962
- Come here.
- I didn't...

08:40.986 --> 08:43.356
- I didn't even do anything. Come here.
- Ow.

08:43.381 --> 08:45.567
You like beating up old
people, tough guy?

08:45.591 --> 08:47.260
I didn't beat up nobody.

08:47.793 --> 08:50.806
Really? You didn't beat up Miriam Harton?

08:50.830 --> 08:53.408
That was lying on the ground.
It was just lying right there.

08:53.432 --> 08:54.877
Yeah, right beside her
where you left her.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.868
Hands against the car.

08:59.105 --> 09:02.351
Darnell Johnson... he was accused
of murdering Muhammad Akin,

09:02.375 --> 09:03.685
another gang member.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.354
So a public service homicide.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.723
His fingerprints and his hat
were found at the scene

09:07.747 --> 09:10.926
and a witness identified
him as the shooter.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.095
Wait a minute,
this case is five years old.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.496
Why are we looking at this?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.265
Darnell is saying he's innocent.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.334
Erin, everyone at Rikers
is saying they're innocent.

09:19.358 --> 09:20.869
Uh, everyone at Sing Sing,

09:20.893 --> 09:22.604
everyone in every jail everywhere

09:22.628 --> 09:23.872
says they're innocent.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.474
The witness recanted.

09:25.498 --> 09:28.177
Yeah, but his DNA
i-is still at the scene.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.512
How'd this case come to you?

09:30.970 --> 09:33.649
Jack. He's working with
the Innocence Project.

09:34.349 --> 09:35.584
I should've known.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.053
Every time this guy comes around,

09:38.077 --> 09:39.454
there's trouble, every time.

09:39.478 --> 09:42.662
I need to know that I didn't
put away an innocent person

09:42.686 --> 09:44.633
for the last five years of his life.

09:44.657 --> 09:46.244
I can't just hand that off
to someone else.

09:46.268 --> 09:48.797
And he knows that, uh,
which is why he goes to you

09:48.821 --> 09:50.229
instead of the proper channels.

09:50.253 --> 09:51.416
Are you going to help me

09:51.440 --> 09:53.669
or are you going to lecture me
on Jack Boyle?

09:53.693 --> 09:55.412
Both.

09:59.582 --> 10:01.777
Uh, this witness... why'd she recant?

10:01.801 --> 10:04.680
Uh, and does Darnell,
does he have an alibi?

10:04.704 --> 10:06.281
That's what we need to find out.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.183
Hey, you know what I need to find out?

10:08.207 --> 10:10.252
Why you give Jack
the benefit of the doubt

10:10.276 --> 10:12.844
every single time he comes to your door.

10:19.385 --> 10:22.063
Where were you October 30th at 8:15 a.m.?

10:22.911 --> 10:25.300
- Work.
- No, you weren't.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.169
You recognize her?

10:27.193 --> 10:28.303
No.

10:28.327 --> 10:29.738
That's funny

10:29.762 --> 10:31.619
'cause you had her stolen
credit card in your pocket.

10:31.643 --> 10:33.012
That's criminal possession.

10:33.036 --> 10:34.710
I told you I found it.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.478
What?

10:36.502 --> 10:37.879
Detectives.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.215
St. Irene's Hospital's on the line.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.783
You want to take it?

10:42.187 --> 10:43.721
I'm good.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.890
- I found that card.
- Shut your mouth.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.111
- You knocked that old man down.
- I did not.

10:51.135 --> 10:52.694
Yes, you did.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.336
You were arrested for assault
and robbery last month.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.040
Yeah, and I got released.

10:57.064 --> 10:59.444
Because you target old men
and you target old women

10:59.468 --> 11:01.403
who can't positively I.D. you

11:01.427 --> 11:03.338
because their memories aren't
so good, isn't that right?

11:03.362 --> 11:05.340
I don't target nobody.

11:05.364 --> 11:08.044
- You don't target nobody?
- No.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.978
That means you do target
somebody, dumb-dumb.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.280
It's a double negative.

11:11.863 --> 11:12.948
What?

11:12.972 --> 11:16.451
Kind of like I don't believe
you're not the perp, stupid.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.086
I'm done answering questions.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.378
- The hell you are...
- Danny.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.284
Sit tight, tough guy.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.680
Yes?

11:32.925 --> 11:34.569
Charges have changed.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.104
What are you talking about?

11:36.128 --> 11:38.173
Well, if we can nail that son of a bitch,

11:38.197 --> 11:39.841
the charge just changed to murder.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.112
Why?

11:41.136 --> 11:43.603
Mrs. Harton just died of her injuries.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.417
I ain't shoot nobody!

11:48.441 --> 11:50.235
Hey! You're under arrest.

11:51.568 --> 11:54.389
Hey, yo, you cannot arrest me
for throwing water on no scum!

11:54.413 --> 11:56.590
It's just water, my dude! Yo...

11:58.951 --> 12:00.929
You just saw a cell phone video

12:00.953 --> 12:02.964
that shows Sergeant Jamison Reagan,

12:02.988 --> 12:05.334
the youngest son of Police
Commissioner Frank Reagan,

12:05.358 --> 12:08.570
as he throws water on an unarmed suspect,

12:08.594 --> 12:11.773
Renzo Williams, who is now
claiming police brutality.

12:14.266 --> 12:18.413
I guess I was fooling myself
thinking this might not get out.

12:18.437 --> 12:21.406
Do you want to see them
now? They're already here.

12:23.587 --> 12:24.731
Them?

12:24.756 --> 12:27.397
Sergeant Reagan and Lieutenant Gormley.

12:31.195 --> 12:32.896
Okay.

12:38.724 --> 12:41.269
I asked the lieutenant to sit in
to represent the rank and file.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.204
Baker, please join us.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.877
You want backup, I want backup.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.535
Please sit down.

12:58.577 --> 13:00.222
...not arrest me for throwing water

13:00.246 --> 13:01.390
on no scum!

13:01.414 --> 13:03.725
It's just water, my dude! Yo...

13:17.863 --> 13:19.808
I know what you're gonna say,
but throwing water on him

13:19.832 --> 13:21.710
was a less lethal way
to subdue an unruly...

13:21.734 --> 13:24.913
I read your report. You get
an "A" for creative writing.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.882
That's what happened, Commissioner.

13:26.906 --> 13:30.719
Well, let's talk about
what really happened, Sergeant.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.855
You went after the suspect
because you were pissed off.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.724
Lieutenant, was my arrest
within department guidelines?

13:35.748 --> 13:37.348
Absolutely.

13:39.479 --> 13:40.901
The arrest was.

13:40.925 --> 13:42.764
Your actions were not.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.666
Detective, would you remind us all

13:44.690 --> 13:48.236
of the charge the sergeant faces?

13:48.260 --> 13:51.506
That would be "bringing undue
criticism upon the department."

13:51.530 --> 13:52.774
Thank you.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.410
You have effectively
changed the narrative

13:55.434 --> 13:59.080
from cops under attack to the opposite.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.583
That video doesn't show
what happened right before that.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.486
Exactly. And that's how
this usually goes down.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.355
Which is why cops are expected
to show restraint.

14:07.379 --> 14:08.924
There was no physical harm done.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.426
You brought harm to this department.

14:11.450 --> 14:12.894
By standing up for my cops?

14:12.918 --> 14:14.256
Is that what you think you were doing?

14:14.280 --> 14:15.630
Those cops walked away
this morning because

14:15.654 --> 14:17.532
they were afraid
of backlash, Commissioner.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.701
So you created even more backlash?

14:19.725 --> 14:22.100
I sent a message that
it's not okay to assault cops.

14:22.124 --> 14:24.105
It's not okay to assault perps, either.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.763
That's not exactly what happened.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.377
I stand by my actions.

14:29.401 --> 14:30.770
Well...

14:31.403 --> 14:34.906
your actions have brought you
a command discipline.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.085
Are you serious?

14:37.109 --> 14:38.653
You're dismissed.

14:40.646 --> 14:43.091
Do you want to know what
that guy said to me beforehand?

14:43.115 --> 14:44.993
Return to your command, Sergeant.

14:45.017 --> 14:46.895
Do you even want to know?

14:47.704 --> 14:49.654
Dismissed.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.718
Why'd you drop the charges
against Matthew Greer?

15:13.742 --> 15:15.887
Charges were reduced.

15:15.911 --> 15:17.822
Reduced? What...?

15:17.846 --> 15:20.191
The injuries that he gave to Mrs. Harton

15:20.215 --> 15:21.359
are the reason she died.

15:21.383 --> 15:22.560
That's murder.

15:22.584 --> 15:24.362
You have evidence that
Matthew Greer did it?

15:24.386 --> 15:25.863
'Cause I saw the security footage.

15:25.887 --> 15:28.499
- You can't tell it's him.
- Well, it's his M.O.

15:28.523 --> 15:31.869
Without a positive I.D. from
a victim, I can only charge him

15:31.893 --> 15:33.538
with criminal possession
of stolen property...

15:33.562 --> 15:35.840
- What Stolen property? How about
the fact that he assaulted

15:35.864 --> 15:38.009
an 85-year-old man,
left him with a broken jaw?

15:38.033 --> 15:40.211
Again, do you have evidence?

15:40.235 --> 15:44.103
I was standing outside the
building when Greer ran outside

15:44.127 --> 15:46.784
moments after an old man
was assaulted inside.

15:46.808 --> 15:48.786
So you saw Matthew Greer do it?

15:50.145 --> 15:52.757
Look, I have a positive I.D.
from the victim.

15:52.781 --> 15:54.759
Oh, no. I read the report, Danny.

15:54.783 --> 15:56.227
That victim has dementia.

15:56.251 --> 15:57.895
You know damn well the defense attorney's

15:57.919 --> 16:00.098
going to tear him and the
case apart on the stand.

16:00.122 --> 16:02.533
- Okay. What if it was Grandpa?
- Oh, my God.

16:02.557 --> 16:04.068
No, I'm serious. What if it was Grandpa?

16:04.092 --> 16:05.770
Danny, do you think I want to tell you

16:05.794 --> 16:07.171
you need more evidence?

16:07.195 --> 16:08.773
- Well, that's all you ever tell me.
- Well, guess what?

16:08.797 --> 16:11.399
It's my job, and sometimes it sucks.

16:17.939 --> 16:22.276
Gramps? Dropping off the meat
for Sunday dinner.

16:23.712 --> 16:25.690
Danny boy.

16:25.714 --> 16:28.226
- Hey.
- How was work?

16:28.250 --> 16:30.461
You know. Same old, same old.

16:30.485 --> 16:32.797
Erin being a pain in my ass.

16:32.821 --> 16:34.032
About what?

16:34.056 --> 16:36.646
Well...

16:37.559 --> 16:41.572
I got a perp who's robbing
and assaulting elderly people.

16:41.596 --> 16:44.042
And, uh, you know, I got
a victim to I.D. him,

16:44.066 --> 16:46.144
but she doesn't think
that's enough, of course.

16:46.168 --> 16:47.812
- Why?
- Because she thinks

16:47.836 --> 16:49.247
that the victim has dementia,

16:49.271 --> 16:51.082
so she doesn't want
to put him on the stand.

16:51.106 --> 16:53.551
Maybe she's setting up
roadblocks for a reason.

16:53.575 --> 16:54.886
Gramps, I get

16:54.910 --> 16:57.789
the roadblocks, and I understand
that people rob people,

16:57.813 --> 16:58.956
but this is different.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.558
This is a bad guy. You know?

17:00.582 --> 17:02.293
He doesn't just take money
from these people,

17:02.317 --> 17:04.462
h-he stomps on them and punches them.

17:04.486 --> 17:06.998
B-Believe me, you'd feel
the same way I do if you saw it.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.267
I do feel the same way you do.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.102
In fact,

17:11.806 --> 17:13.637
it's my greatest fear.

17:13.662 --> 17:15.239
Getting mugged again?

17:15.262 --> 17:19.210
No. I'll take a beating any old day.

17:19.233 --> 17:20.778
What I'm most afraid of is the things

17:20.801 --> 17:24.637
that I can't fight back against,
like dementia.

17:28.977 --> 17:31.489
You seem sharp as a tack to me, Gramps.

17:31.513 --> 17:33.057
Yeah, and then one day you're not.

17:33.081 --> 17:36.539
It's gotten to so many of my old friends.

17:39.387 --> 17:42.628
They don't know their own family.

17:43.124 --> 17:48.338
Well, if the day ever comes
where you don't recognize me,

17:48.363 --> 17:51.743
don't know who I am, we'll be okay.

17:51.967 --> 17:54.223
'Cause I'll always know who you are.

18:01.309 --> 18:04.148
The witness might've changed her story,

18:04.172 --> 18:07.358
but Darnell's prints and his hat
were still at the crime scene.

18:07.382 --> 18:09.060
Right.

18:09.084 --> 18:10.628
- Hi.
- Hi, Jack.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.630
I got stuff to do.

18:12.654 --> 18:14.732
- Sit down.
- Uh...

18:14.756 --> 18:16.300
I didn't, uh, mean to interrupt.

18:16.324 --> 18:17.802
You never do.

18:17.826 --> 18:20.638
I just wanted to see
if I can help in any way.

18:21.001 --> 18:22.802
I think you've done enough.

18:23.498 --> 18:25.042
Am I missing something here?

18:25.066 --> 18:26.344
Yeah, a stop button.

18:26.368 --> 18:27.845
Okay, Anthony...

18:27.869 --> 18:29.814
No, no, no. No, let's have it, Anthony.

18:29.838 --> 18:31.215
Because I'm actually wondering
if there's some sort

18:31.239 --> 18:32.817
of statute of limitations
on your attitude towards me?

18:32.841 --> 18:34.218
Well, maybe

18:34.242 --> 18:36.387
if you stop coming to Erin
every time you had a problem.

18:36.411 --> 18:38.823
- Yeah, b... uh, we have history.
- Yeah. Right.

18:38.847 --> 18:41.392
And you screwed up, but somehow
you still think she owes you.

18:41.416 --> 18:42.560
Is that about right?

18:42.584 --> 18:44.529
Okay, do we need to do this right now?

18:44.553 --> 18:46.820
I'll be back later.

18:50.425 --> 18:52.837
He's just being protective.

18:52.861 --> 18:54.939
I didn't know you needed
protection from me.

18:55.409 --> 18:57.141
We've been going through the case.

18:57.165 --> 19:01.579
I spoke with Chantal, who
recanted her original testimony.

19:01.603 --> 19:03.915
She said that the detective told her

19:03.939 --> 19:05.583
that Darnell was the shooter.

19:05.607 --> 19:07.013
See?

19:07.037 --> 19:08.853
Well, I want to talk to the detective.

19:08.877 --> 19:10.221
Oh, don't bother.

19:11.175 --> 19:12.523
Oh, so now you gonna tell me

19:12.547 --> 19:14.192
how to run my investigation?

19:14.216 --> 19:17.695
No. I'm suggesting you not
interview the detective

19:17.719 --> 19:19.564
because he is dead.

19:20.101 --> 19:21.365
Oh.

19:21.389 --> 19:22.867
I'm not the enemy here.

19:22.891 --> 19:25.686
I wish that this hadn't
happened as much as you do.

19:25.710 --> 19:27.972
Well, I'm not convinced it did happen,

19:27.996 --> 19:30.641
because I haven't uncovered
enough to believe

19:30.665 --> 19:33.334
beyond reasonable doubt
that Darnell is innocent.

19:33.358 --> 19:35.446
Yeah, well, there's one person
intimately involved

19:35.470 --> 19:38.382
with the case
who you haven't spoken to yet.

19:38.406 --> 19:39.666
And who's that?

19:39.690 --> 19:41.742
Darnell Johnson.

19:56.731 --> 19:58.469
You're in exceptionally early.

19:58.493 --> 20:00.972
As are you three.

20:00.996 --> 20:03.274
Those perps that threw water

20:03.298 --> 20:05.009
at our officers at the 2-9,

20:05.033 --> 20:07.812
including the copycats at the 15th,

20:07.836 --> 20:10.014
have all been arrested without incident.

20:10.038 --> 20:12.356
The D.A.'s office charged
them with disorderly conduct,

20:12.380 --> 20:14.352
criminal nuisance and harassment.

20:14.376 --> 20:16.087
All of them took a plea.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.213
Okay.

20:18.237 --> 20:20.524
That's a copy of the press
release from the D.A.'s office.

20:20.548 --> 20:21.826
It'll be sent out this afternoon.

20:21.850 --> 20:24.952
Good news. Thank you all.

20:35.997 --> 20:37.475
Sit down.

20:37.499 --> 20:40.945
Did you take a close look
at the video of Jamie's arrest?

20:42.141 --> 20:43.214
Did I miss something?

20:43.238 --> 20:44.548
Well, maybe you missed

20:44.572 --> 20:46.817
that Jamie is not
one of the rank and file.

20:46.841 --> 20:48.152
He's a boss.

20:48.176 --> 20:50.454
And he sees his guys
getting assaulted and he...

20:50.478 --> 20:52.790
And instead of using his head,

20:52.814 --> 20:55.459
he went out on his own to collar the guy.

20:55.483 --> 20:57.194
I would've done the same thing as him.

20:57.218 --> 20:59.864
No, you would not.
Not from where you sit.

20:59.888 --> 21:02.366
Well, only because I know
how you'd react.

21:02.745 --> 21:04.368
Exactly.

21:04.392 --> 21:07.067
And Jamie should know that
better than anyone, Sid.

21:07.091 --> 21:10.174
That arrest sent out a clear message.

21:10.198 --> 21:11.909
He sent the wrong message.

21:11.933 --> 21:13.711
Maybe you are, too.

21:14.590 --> 21:15.980
Meaning?

21:16.004 --> 21:20.084
A rip for a little bit of water,
in light of what that guy did?

21:20.108 --> 21:21.252
Come on, boss.

21:21.276 --> 21:23.321
We can't do what perps do.

21:23.345 --> 21:26.691
He was resisting arrest.
I mean, this could've escalated.

21:26.715 --> 21:28.359
Jamie could've Tasered him.

21:28.383 --> 21:29.493
Would that have been better?

21:29.517 --> 21:31.162
And coming up with worse scenarios

21:31.186 --> 21:33.431
doesn't excuse this one.

21:33.859 --> 21:37.234
Okay. Okay.

21:37.258 --> 21:39.036
You assured the public and the department

21:39.060 --> 21:41.339
that you've got our cops' back.

21:41.363 --> 21:43.040
Maybe you ought to make sure

21:43.064 --> 21:45.733
your son knows you got his back, too.

22:10.325 --> 22:12.803
Mr. Johnson, I don't know
if you remember me, but I'm...

22:12.827 --> 22:14.705
I know who you are.

22:14.729 --> 22:15.873
Okay.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.876
I've been reviewing your case,

22:18.900 --> 22:20.644
and I have a few questions for you.

22:20.668 --> 22:23.080
- Okay.
- I spoke to Chantal.

22:23.104 --> 22:26.579
As you know, she recanted
her original testimony.

22:27.575 --> 22:31.055
But your fingerprints and your
hat were found at the scene.

22:31.079 --> 22:32.556
- So?
- So,

22:32.580 --> 22:35.393
during the trial
you never took the stand.

22:35.417 --> 22:38.662
You never explained why they were there.

22:38.686 --> 22:40.564
They were there
because I went to see Muhammed

22:40.588 --> 22:42.066
earlier that day.

22:42.090 --> 22:43.501
But I didn't kill him.

22:43.525 --> 22:44.902
What did you go see him about?

22:44.926 --> 22:46.137
He owed me money.

22:46.161 --> 22:47.195
Drug money?

22:47.219 --> 22:48.879
What difference does that make now?

22:48.903 --> 22:50.621
I need to know everything that happened.

22:50.645 --> 22:53.534
I'll tell you what you need to know.

22:56.538 --> 23:00.117
You need to know that I've been
in this hellhole

23:00.141 --> 23:05.546
for 1,667 days.

23:07.649 --> 23:08.959
Because of you.

23:08.983 --> 23:12.118
My son turns five

23:12.142 --> 23:14.365
in a month.

23:15.051 --> 23:17.334
And I've only met him once.

23:17.358 --> 23:19.537
Because of you.

23:20.257 --> 23:22.006
Why didn't you take the stand?

23:22.030 --> 23:24.208
Why didn't you say

23:24.232 --> 23:27.344
that you had gone to see
Muhammed earlier in the day?

23:27.368 --> 23:29.079
Because my court-appointed
attorney told me

23:29.103 --> 23:31.890
that if I said that, no one
would believe I didn't kill him.

23:31.914 --> 23:33.370
You should've told the truth.

23:33.394 --> 23:35.886
I told the truth.

23:35.910 --> 23:37.888
You didn't believe me.

23:37.912 --> 23:41.625
And I can tell, just by looking
at you, that you still don't.

23:41.649 --> 23:43.984
So you can go to hell.

24:03.917 --> 24:06.740
Can you, uh, pass me
another slice of Key lime?

24:06.740 --> 24:08.652
That's your third piece.

24:08.676 --> 24:11.321
Well, I'm celebrating today, Gramps.

24:11.345 --> 24:13.456
It's the first time in my life
that I'm not taking flak

24:13.480 --> 24:14.924
for being the hothead of the family.

24:14.948 --> 24:15.992
I'm not a hothead.

24:16.016 --> 24:17.360
Says the hothead.

24:17.384 --> 24:18.695
But don't get me wrong,

24:19.191 --> 24:22.165
I support what you did, 100%.

24:22.189 --> 24:24.213
- Me, too.
- Cut it out.

24:24.238 --> 24:25.935
Right, 'cause we
wouldn't want to hear from cops

24:25.959 --> 24:28.371
at this table how they feel
about my collar, would we?

24:28.395 --> 24:29.873
Your arrest wasn't the issue.

24:29.897 --> 24:32.066
The manner of your arrest was.

24:32.090 --> 24:33.166
Oh.

24:33.190 --> 24:34.551
Anybody want to hear
what I think about it?

24:34.575 --> 24:35.789
Not really.

24:35.814 --> 24:38.014
Well, it's like
your broken window theory.

24:38.038 --> 24:40.285
You know, you see somebody
doing damage to a property,

24:40.309 --> 24:42.519
you start to think, "Okay,
nobody cares about it,"

24:42.543 --> 24:44.911
so more people start to do
damage to the property.

24:44.935 --> 24:46.556
Same thing with cops.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.258
- That's a bit of a stretch.
- No, he's got a point.

24:48.282 --> 24:50.360
Every day you hear
another story about a cop

24:50.384 --> 24:53.186
being harassed for just doing
their job, and eventually,

24:53.210 --> 24:54.975
it becomes accepted practice

24:54.999 --> 24:56.807
- to harass cops.
- Exactly right.

24:56.831 --> 25:00.870
Not if cops arrest violators
when it happens,

25:00.894 --> 25:04.441
within the confines of the law
and without malice.

25:04.465 --> 25:06.705
I say an eye for an eye.

25:06.729 --> 25:08.539
Makes the whole world blind.

25:08.564 --> 25:11.146
Exactly. We don't have
the luxury of breaking rules

25:11.171 --> 25:12.347
to make a point.

25:12.371 --> 25:15.452
Right, so just a different set
of rules for us. Is that it?

25:15.476 --> 25:17.041
Exactly right.

25:17.745 --> 25:20.423
Cops should be held to a higher standard.

25:20.447 --> 25:21.758
And what about D.A.s?

25:21.782 --> 25:23.760
Should they be held
to a higher standard, too?

25:23.784 --> 25:25.328
- Yeah.
- Really?

25:25.352 --> 25:27.230
So, how come when a cop makes a mistake,

25:27.254 --> 25:29.663
they're crucified in the media,
they lose their jobs

25:29.663 --> 25:31.508
and there's no room for human error,

25:31.532 --> 25:34.511
but when a D.A. makes a mistake,
nothing happens to them?

25:34.535 --> 25:36.346
That's right.
You see stories all the time

25:36.370 --> 25:38.181
about people being locked up

25:38.205 --> 25:40.550
for years, and then it turns
out that they are innocent.

25:40.574 --> 25:42.185
Yeah, what happens to the D.A.

25:42.209 --> 25:44.521
in those circumstances, sis?

25:44.545 --> 25:47.424
They apologize? No, they don't
even bother to apologize.

25:47.448 --> 25:49.010
They just move on with their lives.

25:49.034 --> 25:51.761
No one moves on from
a wrongful prosecution, Danny,

25:51.785 --> 25:54.898
and all we have are the facts,
not crystal balls.

25:54.922 --> 25:57.834
Mm-hmm. You know, Sean,
the, uh, broken windows theory

25:57.858 --> 26:00.670
about cops, it also applies to
old people. Did you know that?

26:01.442 --> 26:03.940
Yeah. See, if someone thinks

26:03.964 --> 26:05.909
a certain group of people is broken,

26:05.933 --> 26:09.112
then it makes it seem like
no one cares about them,

26:09.136 --> 26:11.281
which sends the message that you can

26:11.305 --> 26:13.783
violate them without any repercussion.

26:13.807 --> 26:15.952
You have something you want to say to me?

26:16.809 --> 26:18.185
I just said it.

26:24.718 --> 26:26.252
Hello.

26:28.055 --> 26:29.432
What are you doing here?

26:29.988 --> 26:31.535
This is for you.

26:31.559 --> 26:34.437
- What's that?
- Wheatgrass.

26:34.461 --> 26:36.439
When did you get so healthy?

26:36.463 --> 26:39.609
Oh, not me. I got a
double shot of espresso.

26:39.633 --> 26:41.745
But for you, I got
the most disgusting thing

26:41.769 --> 26:43.380
I could find on the menu.

26:43.404 --> 26:44.614
I figured you'll love it.

26:45.170 --> 26:46.883
What are you really doing here?

26:47.381 --> 26:49.219
The DNA results came back.

26:49.243 --> 26:53.490
Belong to a Malcolm Scott,
known drug dealer and drug user.

26:53.514 --> 26:56.092
He's in prison for two other murders.

26:56.640 --> 26:58.061
Anything else?

26:58.085 --> 27:00.363
The gun in the two other
murders he's in for

27:00.387 --> 27:03.133
matches the gun that
killed Muhammad Akin.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.268
So Darnell is innocent.

27:05.292 --> 27:07.293
Looks that way.

27:35.322 --> 27:37.467
Do I need a lawyer?

27:37.491 --> 27:40.337
If you need your lawyer, we'll
get your lawyer down here.

27:40.361 --> 27:41.705
Am I being charged?

27:41.729 --> 27:44.107
Not yet. We can talk first

27:44.131 --> 27:45.442
and hear your side of things.

27:45.466 --> 27:46.610
Yeah.

27:46.634 --> 27:48.778
This is more of a courtesy.

27:48.802 --> 27:50.981
- What are you talking about?
- We wanted

27:51.005 --> 27:52.882
to extend you the courtesy
of letting you know

27:52.906 --> 27:57.887
that the charges against you
will now include murder.

27:57.911 --> 27:59.789
I never killed anyone in my life.

27:59.813 --> 28:01.391
You might not have meant to kill anyone,

28:01.415 --> 28:03.059
but you definitely killed someone.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.161
You're talking out your ass.

28:06.481 --> 28:07.998
Maybe so.

28:08.022 --> 28:10.367
But we got security camera
footage of your work truck

28:10.391 --> 28:11.868
at the location of the murder.

28:11.892 --> 28:14.471
We know you committed these
crimes while you were working

28:14.495 --> 28:16.306
because you figured
that would be your alibi.

28:16.330 --> 28:18.141
And after all, who's gonna
believe the testimony

28:18.165 --> 28:20.377
of a bunch of frail old people, right?

28:20.401 --> 28:22.045
But the jury's gonna be out

28:22.069 --> 28:24.881
on you causing the death
of a young mother.

28:24.905 --> 28:26.549
Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.

28:26.573 --> 28:28.518
I never targeted a young person.

28:28.542 --> 28:30.320
We believe you didn't mean to kill her,

28:30.344 --> 28:31.921
but you busted into her apartment,

28:31.945 --> 28:34.257
you knocked her on the ground,
she hit her head on the ground

28:34.281 --> 28:36.259
and unfortunately,

28:36.283 --> 28:38.261
she died, so that's murder.

28:38.285 --> 28:40.196
I never went into anyone's apartment.

28:40.220 --> 28:41.431
Fits your M.O.

28:41.455 --> 28:42.999
And now she's dead.

28:43.023 --> 28:44.034
Yep.

28:44.058 --> 28:46.336
I never killed nobody.

28:46.360 --> 28:47.845
There you go again
with the double negatives.

28:47.869 --> 28:49.406
Come on... stop confusing me.

28:49.430 --> 28:51.675
Okay. How about I make it
real easy for you?

28:51.699 --> 28:54.010
The D.A. wants to charge you with murder.

28:54.034 --> 28:57.036
We don't want to charge you with murder.

29:00.180 --> 29:01.451
That's right.

29:01.475 --> 29:02.975
I never killed nobody.

29:03.892 --> 29:05.422
I never killed anyone.

29:05.446 --> 29:07.223
- Right.
- I swear.

29:07.247 --> 29:09.059
Good. Then how about this?

29:09.083 --> 29:12.295
You give us a list of the people
that you did victimize,

29:12.319 --> 29:14.397
and we'll make sure
that you're only charged

29:14.421 --> 29:16.533
for the crimes that you did commit.

29:16.557 --> 29:18.368
The robberies.

29:19.343 --> 29:22.369
And not the murder of this young mother.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.172
Okay.

29:36.883 --> 29:37.995
Deal.

29:38.802 --> 29:39.756
Great.

29:39.780 --> 29:41.324
You were right.

29:41.348 --> 29:43.416
He is smart.

30:04.438 --> 30:06.425
A Reagan in a crisis of conscience

30:06.449 --> 30:09.252
always goes to one place, and I, uh...

30:09.276 --> 30:12.111
I happen to know that
this is your favorite one.

30:17.090 --> 30:18.800
How are you doing?

30:19.653 --> 30:21.553
The truth?

30:23.347 --> 30:25.390
If I was Darnell,

30:26.660 --> 30:29.139
and I was separated from Nicky
for the first five years

30:29.163 --> 30:31.975
of her life, I'm not sure
I could ever get over it.

30:32.564 --> 30:35.111
No, you're the strongest woman
that I know.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.349
God, I wish I was as tough
as everyone thinks I am.

30:39.373 --> 30:43.052
You know, you can ask for help sometimes.

30:43.617 --> 30:46.787
What do you think I'm doing here?

30:49.817 --> 30:52.796
I think that you should talk to Darnell.

30:53.335 --> 30:57.000
The last time I spoke to him,
he told me to go to hell.

30:57.024 --> 30:58.991
Never stopped you from talking to me.

31:01.528 --> 31:03.907
Erin, I will go with you.

31:04.262 --> 31:07.477
It's my case, it's my responsibility.

31:07.501 --> 31:10.713
You are such a Reagan sometimes.

31:10.737 --> 31:13.149
And you say that like it's a bad thing.

31:13.173 --> 31:15.141
Yeah, sometimes it is.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.587
You know,

31:17.611 --> 31:21.424
I even started to feel bad
that I brought this case to you.

31:21.448 --> 31:24.717
And then I thought,
"No, this case is a gift."

31:26.386 --> 31:28.364
Well, can I please return it?

31:28.388 --> 31:31.000
You have been given a chance

31:31.024 --> 31:34.938
to fix something before it is too late.

31:34.962 --> 31:37.964
And that is something to be grateful for.

31:40.227 --> 31:42.718
So, you're welcome.

32:03.056 --> 32:04.766
I feel like I'm just
gonna go with the burger.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.761
- Are you even listening to me?
- Mm-hmm.

32:08.348 --> 32:10.389
Please don't tell me
you agree with my dad.

32:10.413 --> 32:12.895
You're mad at your dad because you feel

32:12.920 --> 32:15.632
like he treats you different,
he expects more from you

32:15.656 --> 32:17.534
and he's too righteous.

32:17.558 --> 32:20.427
He holds all of you
to a really high moral standard.

32:21.829 --> 32:23.140
S-So?

32:23.164 --> 32:26.511
Jamie, he challenges you
to be a better person.

32:27.435 --> 32:31.237
And, if I'm being honest,
I kind of love that about him.

32:41.849 --> 32:44.776
Just pick out the photos
of the people you victimized

32:44.800 --> 32:47.564
and you won't be charged with
any crimes you didn't commit.

32:47.588 --> 32:49.132
Or a murder you didn't commit.

32:49.569 --> 32:51.137
Right.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.138
That young woman that got killed,

32:55.874 --> 32:57.841
- what was her name?
- Evelyn...

32:57.865 --> 32:59.209
Campbell.

32:59.233 --> 33:00.544
But I already gave you my word.

33:00.568 --> 33:01.912
You're not gonna be charged
with her murder.

33:02.255 --> 33:03.937
Okay.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.049
So, just assault and robbery?

33:09.073 --> 33:11.321
You'll only be charged with
the crimes that you committed

33:11.345 --> 33:13.580
against the people you victimized.

33:17.924 --> 33:19.091
Okay.

33:22.275 --> 33:23.433
Him.

33:23.457 --> 33:24.624
Mm-hmm.

33:26.166 --> 33:27.656
Her.

33:30.158 --> 33:31.598
Her.

33:37.538 --> 33:40.974
And... her.

33:42.155 --> 33:43.489
Mrs. Harton.

33:44.745 --> 33:46.112
Are you sure about that?

33:47.248 --> 33:49.783
Yeah. I'm sure.

33:51.786 --> 33:54.397
I'll come find you after
he signs his confession.

33:54.421 --> 33:56.122
I look forward to it.

33:58.485 --> 34:00.096
Numbers are on the back.

34:00.121 --> 34:03.213
Write down their names and what
you did to them and sign it.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.318
Okay.

34:07.268 --> 34:10.614
Evelyn Campbell?
Your fourth grade teacher?

34:10.638 --> 34:12.815
You know, I never
really liked Ms. Campbell.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.252
She used to pull on my ear a lot.

34:15.275 --> 34:17.754
Well, that was a particularly good bluff.

34:17.777 --> 34:19.822
You didn't promise that he
wouldn't be charged with murder,

34:19.847 --> 34:21.458
you promised he would only be charged

34:21.482 --> 34:23.193
with the crimes he did commit.

34:23.217 --> 34:24.694
Yep. And right now,

34:24.717 --> 34:27.074
he thinks his victim
Mrs. Harton is still alive.

34:27.099 --> 34:30.967
Once he finishes signing the
confession, I'll let him know she died

34:30.991 --> 34:33.069
and... we'll charge him with murder.

34:33.092 --> 34:34.404
Simple.

34:34.428 --> 34:37.206
Well, you're really good
at your job, Detective Reagan.

34:37.231 --> 34:39.549
Can I buy you a drink after work?

34:39.572 --> 34:44.380
No. I can't. I've got some
broken windows to repair.

34:44.405 --> 34:45.715
Right.

34:46.252 --> 34:47.753
Good luck.

35:09.176 --> 35:10.653
Hi.

35:11.122 --> 35:12.971
Hey.

35:16.136 --> 35:17.891
In my job,

35:19.809 --> 35:23.753
99.9% of the people I prosecute

35:23.777 --> 35:25.922
say they're innocent.

35:26.566 --> 35:30.247
During your trial, and really,
up until quite recently,

35:30.271 --> 35:32.562
I was convinced that you were guilty.

35:33.114 --> 35:36.566
Everything pointed that way.

35:36.590 --> 35:40.126
The evidence, Chantal's testimony.

35:44.198 --> 35:45.675
So, yeah, you were right.

35:45.699 --> 35:48.797
I did not believe you
when you said you were innocent.

35:52.573 --> 35:54.386
But I do now.

35:58.098 --> 36:01.124
I am recommending that you be exonerated.

36:01.148 --> 36:02.292
I plan on being

36:02.316 --> 36:06.147
in court to set the record straight.

36:07.315 --> 36:09.499
Other than that,
there's really not much I can do

36:09.523 --> 36:12.278
to make up for the lost time.

36:17.865 --> 36:20.510
To say I'm sorry just feels so little

36:20.534 --> 36:23.164
in light of what you've been through.

36:31.211 --> 36:35.135
I just hope that somewhere
down the line, you...

36:38.385 --> 36:41.474
...find it in your heart to forgive me.

36:59.707 --> 37:02.986
My lawyer told me that

37:03.288 --> 37:07.958
if I hold on to this hate and resentment,

37:08.668 --> 37:12.329
the rest of my life will be
just as much a prison sentence

37:12.353 --> 37:15.021
as the last five years have been.

37:21.228 --> 37:22.932
I forgive you.

37:51.558 --> 37:53.259
Thank you.

38:10.210 --> 38:11.421
We are gonna get started

38:11.445 --> 38:12.922
with what we call the fast round.

38:12.946 --> 38:16.026
The first team to shout the
correct answer gets one token.

38:16.050 --> 38:17.727
Five tokens gets you a free round.

38:17.751 --> 38:20.363
- Yes!
- Why did you pick this place?

38:20.387 --> 38:22.932
We'll kick their butts
together, okay? Um...

38:22.956 --> 38:25.535
Two, uh, Finnerty's on the rocks, please.

38:25.559 --> 38:26.936
Thank you.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.938
So how'd your case go?

38:28.962 --> 38:30.840
Great. We got the perp to confess.

38:30.864 --> 38:32.409
Question one.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.645
You go ahead. I-I-I'll sit this one out.

38:35.669 --> 38:36.814
Well, suit yourself.

38:36.838 --> 38:40.050
Which U.S. President had a home
called "The Hermitage"?

38:40.074 --> 38:41.951
Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson!

38:42.637 --> 38:44.721
That's right. Give team...

38:44.745 --> 38:47.223
- Uh, Flatfoot.
- Flatfoot.

38:47.247 --> 38:49.477
Team Flatfoot a token over there.

38:51.018 --> 38:52.362
Not for nothing,

38:52.386 --> 38:54.431
but I thought you were
gonna sit this round out.

38:54.455 --> 38:56.555
- Beginner's luck.
- Ah, right.

38:56.579 --> 38:59.169
Second question. In which movie

38:59.193 --> 39:01.337
did Humphrey Bogart play Charlie...

39:01.361 --> 39:03.339
<i>- African Queen.</i>
- That's right.

39:03.363 --> 39:05.842
Another token for Team Flatfoot.

39:05.866 --> 39:08.738
Maybe I'm pretty good at this after all.

39:08.762 --> 39:10.680
You think?

39:11.557 --> 39:13.650
You're a regular ringer, Gramps.

39:13.674 --> 39:15.418
You were worried about me,

39:15.442 --> 39:17.787
didn't want me to feel like
I was losing it.

39:17.811 --> 39:20.657
Hmm. Is it working?

39:20.681 --> 39:22.725
Hell yeah.

39:22.749 --> 39:24.304
All right.

39:43.837 --> 39:45.617
You mind?

39:47.773 --> 39:49.841
It's a free country.

39:51.145 --> 39:52.922
How long you been here?

39:52.946 --> 39:55.585
Oh, since 4:30.

39:56.817 --> 39:58.361
Looking for bass?

39:58.385 --> 40:01.397
They're more active
before the light comes up.

40:01.758 --> 40:03.566
Get any bites?

40:03.590 --> 40:05.568
Caught a six pound striper,

40:05.592 --> 40:08.306
but he was pretty beat up.

40:09.363 --> 40:10.696
I know the feeling.

40:14.234 --> 40:16.479
You're using silversides.

40:16.503 --> 40:18.566
Always prepared.

40:20.693 --> 40:24.530
Not for everything,
as this last week pointed out.

40:27.748 --> 40:30.059
You knew how I'd react.

40:30.083 --> 40:31.227
I didn't.

40:31.251 --> 40:33.029
Yeah, you did.

40:33.053 --> 40:36.042
Seconds before or after,

40:37.293 --> 40:39.936
but you were gonna do
what you were gonna do,

40:39.960 --> 40:42.238
or defend what you did.

40:42.632 --> 40:45.802
I'm always gonna do the job
the way that I see fit.

40:50.904 --> 40:54.073
Pop told me you'd be here.

41:03.483 --> 41:05.685
In response to you asking?

41:13.026 --> 41:16.291
Same situation, I might've
done the same thing.

41:17.164 --> 41:18.808
Might've.

41:19.127 --> 41:21.544
Would have. You were a sergeant

41:21.568 --> 41:23.079
and they were cops in your house.

41:23.103 --> 41:25.300
Might have.

41:26.206 --> 41:27.917
Times were different then.

41:28.886 --> 41:31.221
And maybe going along with the times

41:31.245 --> 41:33.599
isn't always the wisest thing.

41:33.981 --> 41:37.327
I'm a sergeant
and I-I want to set an example,

41:37.351 --> 41:39.085
climate be damned.

41:41.121 --> 41:43.566
Same goes for me, too.

41:43.590 --> 41:45.602
Is that why I got a two-day rip?

41:46.612 --> 41:49.962
I have to hold you to a higher standard.

41:53.085 --> 41:55.420
And climate be damned.
