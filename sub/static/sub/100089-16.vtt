WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:04.453
God, I hate when they close
the school for no reason.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.269
Well, there is a good reason.

00:06.302 --> 00:07.773
Teacher enrichment?
It's gonna be off the hook.

00:07.798 --> 00:09.062
You didn't hear this from me,

00:09.113 --> 00:12.251
but word on the street is
there's gonna be bagels.

00:12.275 --> 00:14.579
So, now we're stuck with them?
Is that even legal?

00:14.612 --> 00:16.713
Guess that means I'm bringing
Graham to the law firm with me.

00:16.746 --> 00:18.448
And apparently Rory, too,

00:18.481 --> 00:20.884
because he is obsessed
with some dumb law show.

00:20.917 --> 00:23.553
It's called "Gavel Town,"
and it's about Deb Schwepps,

00:23.586 --> 00:25.189
a big-city lawyer who gets banished

00:25.222 --> 00:26.923
to a small town in Georgia.

00:26.957 --> 00:28.926
Tagline... "Don't judge her."

00:28.958 --> 00:31.262
My man.

00:31.295 --> 00:33.431
My job is nothing like "Gavel Town."

00:33.463 --> 00:35.098
Overruled.

00:35.131 --> 00:36.967
<i>- Pro bono, you didn't!</i>
- What's that?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.735
"LL"? Who's LL?

00:38.768 --> 00:40.604
Cool J or Bean? Cool J or Bean?!

00:40.637 --> 00:43.240
Okay, it's "landlord,"
as in the Winebrary landlord,

00:43.274 --> 00:45.609
and I haven't opened it yet
because it's scary mail,

00:45.643 --> 00:47.678
and when I get scary mail,
I have to wait

00:47.710 --> 00:49.412
until I'm emotionally ready to read it.

00:49.445 --> 00:51.414
And I'm thinking I'll be there
in about 10 more business days.

00:51.448 --> 00:53.518
Well, that's insane.
What if it's important?

00:53.551 --> 00:55.118
Uh, what's important

00:55.152 --> 00:56.987
is that she's honoring
her own timetable,

00:57.021 --> 00:58.588
and there's real power in that.

00:58.621 --> 01:00.591
To which I say, madam...

01:03.169 --> 01:04.262
Sorry.

01:04.294 --> 01:05.829
I've been spending a lot of time
at the Winebrary,

01:05.863 --> 01:07.231
and it's having a real effect on me.

01:07.264 --> 01:09.399
I'm very into female empowerment now,

01:09.432 --> 01:11.768
and also I am drunk most of the time.

01:11.801 --> 01:13.571
Wait, so you've been
skipping out on work?

01:13.604 --> 01:15.473
As much as possible.
I just can't face it.

01:15.505 --> 01:18.208
It's been so awkward
since I broke up with Tracy.

01:18.241 --> 01:20.810
I have been doing a lot
of pretend phone calls.

01:24.648 --> 01:27.151
Gary? Gary, calm down!

01:27.184 --> 01:28.586
I can help you land this plane,

01:28.619 --> 01:29.954
but you gotta remain calm, okay?

01:29.987 --> 01:31.321
Gary? Gary, lower your voice.

01:31.354 --> 01:32.570
Gary, pull up!

01:32.595 --> 01:34.864
Gary!!

01:35.792 --> 01:38.963
I'm sorry, I just couldn't
watch you land another plane.

01:38.996 --> 01:40.964
Are you almost done with the toaster?

01:40.997 --> 01:42.666
Guys, I dated my boss.

01:42.699 --> 01:45.268
Why did you let me do that?
This is on you.

01:45.301 --> 01:46.437
Okay, while you were all spellbound

01:46.470 --> 01:48.839
by his story about toast, I did a thing.

01:48.872 --> 01:50.141
I opened the mail.

01:50.173 --> 01:53.109
Turns out that they raised
your rent two months ago,

01:53.142 --> 01:56.012
and between the late fees
and some other crap,

01:56.045 --> 01:57.982
you owe 8 grand.

01:58.014 --> 01:59.916
Douglas, this is why
I said don't open it!

01:59.949 --> 02:02.219
And not to be that guy,
but you also owe me 10 bucks

02:02.252 --> 02:03.353
from the movies last week.

02:05.655 --> 02:09.025

<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

02:11.061 --> 02:12.330
I can't believe this.

02:12.363 --> 02:14.298
Like, what kind of landlord
just raises the rent?

02:14.330 --> 02:17.268
A good one. I raise the rent
on the shed every year.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.970
You're not seeing a dime over 5%.

02:20.003 --> 02:21.805
Talk to us when our lease is over.

02:21.839 --> 02:23.874
Oh, okay, look,
I'm gonna write you a check,

02:23.906 --> 02:25.976
and I'm gonna fix this all up,
all right?

02:26.009 --> 02:29.309
Oh, you think you can
just solve a woman's problem

02:29.334 --> 02:31.181
- with your checkbook?
- Yes.

02:31.215 --> 02:32.450
Why don't you swipe your credit card

02:32.483 --> 02:33.951
on her ass while you're at it?

02:33.983 --> 02:35.452
Will, you gotta hang out here less.

02:35.485 --> 02:37.088
Douglas, I don't need your money.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.857
- I'm gonna handle this on my own.
- Okay, option B...

02:40.890 --> 02:44.095
and I'm sure this isn't
gonna be a crowd pleaser...

02:44.127 --> 02:46.297
- cut your losses and close.
- Huh?

02:46.329 --> 02:48.299
- Huh?!
- W-What?

02:48.332 --> 02:50.033
It's the best business decision.

02:50.066 --> 02:52.469
Douglas Robert Fogerty. Close?!

02:52.502 --> 02:53.637
There is no way in hell

02:53.670 --> 02:55.538
I would ever shut down the Winebrary!

02:55.572 --> 02:57.741
I'm gonna figure this out.

02:57.775 --> 02:58.908
Yeah, and I'm gonna help!

02:58.941 --> 03:00.844
As long as it doesn't
involve going near KZOP,

03:00.877 --> 03:02.713
seeing Tracy, or making toast.

03:02.745 --> 03:04.781
That's a real trigger snack for me.

03:04.815 --> 03:06.050
Oh, see, my trigger snack is popcorn.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.484
It's just like, oh, so g...

03:07.518 --> 03:09.787
Wait, don't distract me!
Come on, let's go, Will.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.021
Watch the bar for me, okay?

03:11.055 --> 03:12.690
W-W-W-Wait,

03:12.722 --> 03:14.824
y-you're gonna leave me alone
with these people?

03:17.794 --> 03:20.030
"These people" are regulars.

03:20.064 --> 03:22.166
Right, right. And what do
they call themselves?

03:22.198 --> 03:23.868
The, uh... The Wine-o's?

03:23.900 --> 03:26.102
Winebrarians. And we run this joint.

03:26.136 --> 03:27.604
I've seen this on Animal Planet,

03:27.638 --> 03:29.707
and I'm the antelope.

03:29.739 --> 03:31.274
<i>Objection!</i>

03:31.307 --> 03:34.412
<i>Judge, this is a mockery
of our judicial system.</i>

03:34.445 --> 03:35.979
<i>In New York City...</i>

03:36.013 --> 03:37.448
You're not in New York City anymore!

03:38.816 --> 03:40.785
You're in Gavel Town.

03:40.817 --> 03:42.686
You're gonna be eatin' those words

03:42.720 --> 03:45.189
with your grits for breakfast.

03:45.221 --> 03:47.791
Your mom's office
is nothing like this show.

03:47.824 --> 03:50.828
Yeah, this place is the pits.

03:50.860 --> 03:52.929
Mom, we're bored.

03:52.963 --> 03:55.132
Well, I'm bored every day of my life.

03:55.164 --> 03:57.467
That's why they pay me the medium bucks.

03:57.501 --> 03:59.136
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh, my God.

03:59.168 --> 04:01.672
Sorry. I forgot you worked here.

04:01.704 --> 04:04.007
Yeah, people always tell me that.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.176
Anyway, I can't stop
thinking about Poppy.

04:06.209 --> 04:07.310
I wish we could help her.

04:07.344 --> 04:09.412
I spent all my money
on my custom calendars.

04:09.446 --> 04:12.817
"Miggy at Large: 2020."

04:12.850 --> 04:15.953
This is just you
shirtless around the office.

04:15.986 --> 04:18.456
Right? Plus I added three new months...

04:18.488 --> 04:21.156
Monember, Julip, and February Two.

04:21.190 --> 04:22.460
Oh, oh, oh!

04:22.492 --> 04:24.994
Hey, maybe we can sell those
and make money for Poppy.

04:25.027 --> 04:27.465
Miggy, no one wants to buy a
calendar in late February.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.333
I mean, the year is basically half over.

04:29.366 --> 04:31.001
- What?
- Hello, co-workers!

04:31.034 --> 04:33.070
And co-lurkers.

04:33.102 --> 04:35.271
My niece is selling Girl Scout Cookies,

04:35.304 --> 04:37.107
- and I would love it if you...
- Tell her to go shake it

04:37.140 --> 04:39.143
outside the grocery store
like everyone else.

04:40.611 --> 04:41.679
Beat it, Kammy.

04:43.847 --> 04:45.116
Bye, Kammy. See you later.

04:46.383 --> 04:47.818
Oh, my God.

04:47.850 --> 04:49.185
That's it!

04:50.287 --> 04:51.455
I have been buying crap

04:51.487 --> 04:52.789
from my co-workers for years...

04:52.823 --> 04:54.291
cookies, wrapping paper,

04:54.323 --> 04:56.292
magazines because apparently
those still exist.

04:56.326 --> 04:59.629
But I've never hit them up for any cash.

04:59.662 --> 05:03.299
Today is the day... we are fundraising

05:03.333 --> 05:05.402
for the Winebrary!

05:05.436 --> 05:07.003
I don't know if people
are gonna give us money

05:07.037 --> 05:09.140
for our friend's wine/bookstore.

05:09.172 --> 05:10.540
But what about raising money

05:10.573 --> 05:12.742
for our beloved co-worker Dolores

05:12.775 --> 05:14.811
who's recovering from a hip injury?

05:14.845 --> 05:16.112
Hold up, who's Dolores?

05:16.145 --> 05:17.580
No one.

05:17.614 --> 05:19.282
I just made her up.

05:19.316 --> 05:21.217
Angie, you bad.

05:21.251 --> 05:22.987
Ooh!

05:23.020 --> 05:25.121
All right, plan time.

05:25.155 --> 05:26.190
I just checked the forecast.

05:26.222 --> 05:28.324
We got a Category Five
brainstorm coming!

05:28.357 --> 05:29.859
Not now, Will,
I'm looking for something.

05:29.893 --> 05:32.729
Ah-ha! I found it.

05:32.763 --> 05:34.307
My engagement ring from Ron.

05:34.331 --> 05:35.478
It's my backup plan.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.801
I always told myself
if I got in a pinch, I could sell it,

05:37.835 --> 05:39.436
and we're in pinch time, baby!

05:39.470 --> 05:41.839
Okay, you know, there's
actually a little part of me

05:41.871 --> 05:43.840
that thought you were gonna
propose to me right now,

05:43.874 --> 05:46.844
and my immediate answer was not no.

05:46.876 --> 05:48.011
I-I'm gonna blow by that.

05:48.044 --> 05:49.646
This is worth a lot of money.

05:49.679 --> 05:50.881
Ron was a bad husband,

05:50.914 --> 05:52.249
but he could splurge on some jewelry.

05:52.282 --> 05:53.951
- Mm.
- That and designer overalls.

05:53.984 --> 05:55.152
So, we find a jewelry store,

05:55.184 --> 05:56.487
and I help you jack up the price.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.722
I've already got a character
locked and loaded

05:58.754 --> 06:00.423
that is going to
guarantee you top dollar.

06:00.456 --> 06:02.959
Fine. But just don't do
your Mrs. Doubtfire voice.

06:02.992 --> 06:04.561
Honestly?

06:04.595 --> 06:05.696
I might.

06:05.729 --> 06:07.255
Don't.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.124
I might.

06:10.467 --> 06:12.553
Hello!

06:14.071 --> 06:15.806
Hello.

06:17.971 --> 06:21.042
Beautiful, isn't it? And not small.

06:21.074 --> 06:22.727
I mean, look at what that thing

06:22.752 --> 06:23.721
did to my finger.

06:23.746 --> 06:25.555
It's called finger droop. Whoop!

06:25.695 --> 06:27.148
You want me to look,
or you want me to listen?

06:27.235 --> 06:28.804
Oh, yeah, you do your thing. Sorry.

06:28.836 --> 06:30.738
Um, excuse me.

06:30.772 --> 06:32.041
I'm developing a headache

06:32.074 --> 06:34.309
from the glare of that majestic piece.

06:34.341 --> 06:36.445
- You're not selling it, are you?
- I am.

06:36.478 --> 06:38.480
Mark Tiffany!

06:38.512 --> 06:40.416
Yes, that Tiffany.

06:40.449 --> 06:41.949
I was just doing my regular stroll

06:41.983 --> 06:43.752
through the District...
that's what we call

06:43.784 --> 06:45.386
the Diamond District in my family.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.922
That must save you a great deal of time.

06:46.954 --> 06:48.289
Mm.

06:48.322 --> 06:50.625
May I?

06:50.659 --> 06:51.894
Oh, it's spectacular.

06:51.926 --> 06:53.961
99-scale capture,

06:53.995 --> 06:55.798
deep-pressed water blessings...

06:55.831 --> 06:58.100
The 4 and 12s are nearly jumping
off the crest-piece!

06:58.132 --> 06:59.635
I-It's a wearable miracle!

07:00.334 --> 07:01.402
I'll give you 200 bucks.

07:01.435 --> 07:02.437
$200?!

07:02.471 --> 07:03.839
- What?
- Yeah.

07:03.872 --> 07:05.973
For the band that holds
that fake diamond.

07:06.007 --> 07:08.810
What?! It's fake?

07:08.844 --> 07:11.884
Ron told me he spent a fortune on this.

07:11.947 --> 07:13.517
Well, uh, congratulations.

07:13.550 --> 07:14.718
Sounds like you divorced the right guy.

07:22.759 --> 07:24.995
Hey, Gabe, sorry to bother you,

07:25.028 --> 07:26.397
but we're collecting money for Dolores.

07:26.430 --> 07:29.066
Dolores? Do I know Dolores?

07:29.098 --> 07:31.235
Of course you know Dolores.

07:31.267 --> 07:33.070
She drives a mid-size sedan,

07:33.103 --> 07:34.905
loves Showtime.

07:34.937 --> 07:37.240
She's got a real
middle-of-the-face kind of nose.

07:37.274 --> 07:40.244
Anyway, we're... we're raising
money for her hip replacement.

07:40.276 --> 07:43.514
Yeah, sure, uh... I got
something here for her.

07:44.747 --> 07:46.916
She's actually getting
both hips replaced.

07:46.949 --> 07:48.752
Yeah, she fell and broke one hip,

07:48.784 --> 07:51.320
then got up, whoop!

07:51.353 --> 07:53.122
Fell and broke the other one.

07:53.156 --> 07:54.324
Yeah.

07:54.356 --> 07:56.693
Then she landed in the toilet,
got a staph infection.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.361
It's tragic.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.964
So tragic.

08:00.964 --> 08:02.266
Thanks, Gabe!

08:02.298 --> 08:03.533
Oh, by the way,
I hope they find your brother.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.869
Thanks.

08:05.901 --> 08:07.103
Yo, you were amazing.

08:07.137 --> 08:08.372
Where did that story even come from?

08:08.404 --> 08:09.440
I don't know!

08:09.473 --> 08:10.708
It just flowed out of me.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.341
Am I a master storyteller?

08:12.375 --> 08:14.344
- Should I start hitting open mics?
- Yeah.

08:14.377 --> 08:15.478
Ha!

08:15.512 --> 08:17.113
Don't give us that look.

08:17.146 --> 08:18.382
I know lying is wrong,

08:18.415 --> 08:20.217
but it's for a good cause,
so that makes it okay.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.685
Spare us the after-school special.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.320
We're bored and want in.

08:23.353 --> 08:24.420
And we can help.

08:24.454 --> 08:26.356
These dimples are just sitting here,

08:26.389 --> 08:27.725
ready to make you money.

08:29.024 --> 08:33.096
As tempting as it is
to use your pretty faces,

08:33.130 --> 08:34.298
that would make me a bad mom...
that and the fact

08:34.331 --> 08:36.365
that I count ranch dressing
as a vegetable.

08:36.399 --> 08:37.933
Now, you two run along,

08:37.967 --> 08:39.068
go get yourself a snack, okay?

08:39.101 --> 08:42.038
Don't worry. That one's on Gabe.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.776
Rory, why did we get one salad

08:46.809 --> 08:48.878
when we could've gotten
10 plastic-wrapped apples?

08:48.912 --> 08:50.080
Because I really want to tell people

08:50.112 --> 08:52.115
that I'm saving space for dinner.

08:52.149 --> 08:54.217
- Oh, no! No!
- Ooh. Ooh.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.519
I'm so sorry.

08:55.552 --> 08:56.787
Uh... uh...

08:56.819 --> 08:59.322
Here.

08:59.356 --> 09:00.724
Here's $20. You guys get another.

09:00.756 --> 09:02.592
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

09:04.059 --> 09:05.695
Aw, man.

09:05.729 --> 09:07.965
Graham, do you know what this means?

09:07.998 --> 09:10.567
- 20 plastic-wrapped apples?
- No.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.668
With that one salad,

09:12.702 --> 09:14.705
we can bleed this office dry

09:14.737 --> 09:16.172
and help Poppy save the Winebrary.

09:16.206 --> 09:17.474
We'll bleed them

09:17.506 --> 09:19.041
just like Deb Schwepps'
low-life ex-husband did

09:19.075 --> 09:20.177
on "Gavel Town."

09:20.210 --> 09:22.079
There's scams on "Gavel Town"?

09:22.111 --> 09:25.783
There's <i> everything</i> on "Gavel Town."

09:27.683 --> 09:30.887
I can't help but feel like
I'm not welcome here.

09:30.921 --> 09:32.485
Pretty sure they hate you, Dad.

09:32.510 --> 09:34.345
The one in the glasses is mine.

09:34.370 --> 09:35.658
I wouldn't read into it.

09:35.692 --> 09:37.727
As long as you pour them wine,
they won't hurt you.

09:40.846 --> 09:43.566
All righty, ladies.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.835
That'll be $9.50.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.936
Here you go.

09:49.338 --> 09:50.673
What the hell is this?

09:50.707 --> 09:51.607
A Bess Buck.

09:51.640 --> 09:52.909
Keep the change.

09:55.477 --> 09:56.779
I mean, really?

09:56.812 --> 09:58.582
It's basically an IOU.

09:58.615 --> 10:01.552
Poppy lets the Winebrarians
use them to pay for drinks.

10:01.585 --> 10:04.129
Here. It's all in the books.

10:06.957 --> 10:10.226
What? Wait a minute.

10:10.259 --> 10:12.495
No way, p-people are paying for drinks

10:12.529 --> 10:14.832
with folded pieces of notebook paper?

10:15.932 --> 10:17.601
Good God, Fran has a deal

10:17.634 --> 10:19.269
where she doesn't have to pay for drinks

10:19.302 --> 10:21.738
un... until a woman is president?

10:21.770 --> 10:23.106
No, no.

10:23.139 --> 10:24.741
This stops now.

10:25.841 --> 10:28.745
There's a new sheriff in town.

10:28.778 --> 10:30.581
Buckle up.

10:34.484 --> 10:37.421
Oh, no! My salad!

10:37.453 --> 10:38.654
Aw!

10:45.461 --> 10:47.965
Hey there. Looks like your hips work.

10:47.998 --> 10:49.900
You got money for someone
with two janky ones?

10:53.669 --> 10:56.472
Hey, helter skelter, back in the van.

11:03.279 --> 11:04.648
But I'm so hungry!

11:06.000 --> 11:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:15.891 --> 11:17.426
Anything for Dolores?

11:19.796 --> 11:21.365
Thank you.

11:27.236 --> 11:29.272
You pee, you pay.

11:34.944 --> 11:39.382
6,998, 6,999...

11:39.415 --> 11:41.084
7,000!

11:43.218 --> 11:44.387
There's 70 bucks here.

11:44.421 --> 11:45.789
That's why I was counting in pennies.

11:45.822 --> 11:47.890
- It's much more exciting.
- Did someone say,

11:47.923 --> 11:49.592
"Ain't no scam like a Rory scam

11:49.625 --> 11:51.513
'cause a Rory scam's got Graham"?

11:52.615 --> 11:54.650
Oh, my God!

11:54.683 --> 11:57.353
There must be, like,
50,000 pennies here!

11:57.386 --> 11:58.687
I know I should be mad

11:58.721 --> 12:01.158
and force you to return this,
but instead,

12:01.191 --> 12:02.526
I'm gonna keep it.

12:02.558 --> 12:03.692
'Cause it's just so flattering

12:03.726 --> 12:05.961
when you see yourself in your child.

12:05.995 --> 12:09.799
Oh! It <i> is</i> true!

12:09.832 --> 12:12.368
You raised all this money for me?

12:12.402 --> 12:13.804
Who the hell are you?

12:13.836 --> 12:15.471
I'm Dolores!

12:16.505 --> 12:20.110
Ohh, so that's where I got it from.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.548
Pack it up, Shakespeare.

12:24.581 --> 12:26.682
Everyone here is writing a screenplay.

12:26.716 --> 12:29.351
Yeah, you're the one
it's gonna happen for.

12:29.384 --> 12:30.754
Sure.

12:32.355 --> 12:34.557
I think you guys
are missing the real point.

12:34.591 --> 12:36.692
The Winebrary is all about vibe.

12:36.726 --> 12:38.695
It's not supposed to feel
like an airport.

12:38.727 --> 12:40.830
Well, maybe it should.
Airports make money.

12:40.864 --> 12:42.532
Vibe don't keep the lights on.

12:42.564 --> 12:45.000
Dude, the regulars are leaving!

12:45.033 --> 12:46.068
That's okay. Let them.

12:46.101 --> 12:48.370
Sometimes you gotta prune
the vine to get to the harvest.

12:48.403 --> 12:49.840
Look, if you want to make money

12:49.873 --> 12:51.307
and turn them into paying customers,

12:51.341 --> 12:52.676
then I know what to do.

12:52.708 --> 12:53.909
But you're not gonna like it.

12:53.942 --> 12:55.511
Does it involve Enya?

12:55.544 --> 12:58.447
No. It's listening. Just try it.

12:59.883 --> 13:04.254
Ladies, why don't you join me
for a glass of...

13:04.287 --> 13:07.423
Girls Just Wine-a Have Fun?

13:07.456 --> 13:08.924
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, my God.

13:08.957 --> 13:10.526
On the house.

13:10.559 --> 13:11.694
- That would be nice.
- Okay.

13:11.727 --> 13:13.697
- Maybe.
- Okay. All right.

13:13.730 --> 13:16.600
I can't believe that my
backup plan was a fake ring.

13:16.633 --> 13:17.701
Actually, I can.

13:17.734 --> 13:19.436
I mean, I married Ron, for God's sakes.

13:19.469 --> 13:21.371
Then I started a business
that's now underwater,

13:21.403 --> 13:23.206
and I can't even open mail
that scares me.

13:23.239 --> 13:26.643
Plus, you're wearing two very
similar, but different shoes.

13:26.676 --> 13:28.945
Oh, get it together, Banks!

13:28.977 --> 13:30.412
See? I'm a mess.

13:30.446 --> 13:31.815
I'm not a badass businesswoman...

13:31.847 --> 13:34.183
I'm a big dummy who makes bad decisions!

13:34.216 --> 13:36.285
I hate seeing you so down on yourself.

13:36.318 --> 13:39.389
It's just, I've been at this
rock-bottom place before.

13:41.124 --> 13:44.194
I remember feeling this lost
the day I decided to leave Ron.

13:44.226 --> 13:46.495
It was every woman's worst nightmare.

13:46.528 --> 13:48.197
You caught him cheating?

13:48.230 --> 13:49.966
No, he bought an alpaca

13:49.999 --> 13:51.468
with the last of our savings.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.601
Aww. Alpacas are cute.

13:52.634 --> 13:53.702
- Will...
- Sorry.

13:53.735 --> 13:56.005
Something inside me just snapped.

13:56.038 --> 13:57.740
You know what?

13:57.774 --> 13:58.741
No.

13:58.774 --> 14:00.010
No.

14:02.077 --> 14:03.947
No, Ron.

14:03.980 --> 14:05.715
It was the weirdest feeling.

14:05.747 --> 14:07.450
I'm driving around,
and Rory's in the back,

14:07.483 --> 14:09.151
nowhere to go, no one to talk to,

14:09.184 --> 14:11.854
no idea what I was
gonna do with my life,

14:11.887 --> 14:13.322
and that's when I saw it.

14:13.356 --> 14:15.102
Ah, the Winebrary.

14:15.127 --> 14:17.180
- Okay, stop skipping ahead!
- Sorry again.

14:28.270 --> 14:29.238
You like it?

14:30.439 --> 14:31.640
I love it.

14:31.674 --> 14:32.909
How much?

14:32.942 --> 14:34.678
50 bucks.

14:34.711 --> 14:36.580
$50?

14:36.612 --> 14:37.680
That's insane.

14:37.713 --> 14:39.281
Look, Team Poppy all day,

14:39.314 --> 14:41.776
but maybe your landlord <i>
should</i> raise your rent.

14:41.801 --> 14:42.908
Oh, no, no, no.

14:42.933 --> 14:44.283
So, that guy was just a squatter

14:44.308 --> 14:46.006
who thought I was propositioning him.

14:46.038 --> 14:47.932
I met the real landlord
a few days later.

14:47.957 --> 14:49.977
Poppy, do you hear yourself?

14:50.009 --> 14:51.177
You took a dark moment

14:51.210 --> 14:52.879
and turned your whole life around!

14:52.912 --> 14:54.815
You're right. I don't wallow...

14:54.848 --> 14:56.317
I face my fears head-on.

14:56.349 --> 14:58.219
I don't need a stupid ring
to be my backup plan.

14:58.252 --> 14:59.520
My backup plan is me.

14:59.552 --> 15:02.355
I want to say "Yaaaas queen"
so bad. It's right there.

15:02.388 --> 15:04.157
I appreciate the restraint,

15:04.190 --> 15:06.627
but I thank you for being
with me today, Will.

15:06.660 --> 15:08.963
Bring it in. Ohh.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.197
And you know what?

15:11.230 --> 15:13.234
You've inspired me.

15:13.267 --> 15:15.669
I want to try to be friends with Tracy.

15:15.701 --> 15:17.237
I think of all you've gone through

15:17.271 --> 15:18.705
with Ron and your business

15:18.738 --> 15:20.541
and your current shoe situation...

15:20.574 --> 15:22.376
Dude, your shoes have wheels on them.

15:23.542 --> 15:24.945
True.

15:24.978 --> 15:26.347
But if you can get through all of that,

15:26.379 --> 15:28.849
then I can get through some
awkward moments with my ex.

15:28.882 --> 15:30.383
All right!

15:30.416 --> 15:32.418
Take me to KZOP.

15:32.451 --> 15:33.787
I'm ready to make some toast.

15:33.820 --> 15:35.489
I am so proud of you.

15:36.794 --> 15:38.463
Launch me.

15:40.667 --> 15:43.831
So, after my drinking got the
best of me, my husband left me.

15:43.933 --> 15:45.718
I needed a place to go,

15:45.802 --> 15:47.870
- and this place became my home.
- Wow.

15:47.904 --> 15:49.873
So, you picked a bar.

15:49.905 --> 15:53.308
Okay, there's no judgment.
Just listening.

15:53.341 --> 15:55.444
Poppy was really there for me.

15:55.477 --> 15:59.649
She was my shoulder to cry on.
She was my therapist.

15:59.682 --> 16:00.850
She was my maid of honor

16:00.883 --> 16:02.685
when I married myself
down at the courthouse.

16:02.717 --> 16:05.954
I don't think I would be alive today

16:05.987 --> 16:07.555
- if it were not for her.
- Mm.

16:07.580 --> 16:10.459
Well, you know, I-I-I'm just
trying to fix things for Poppy.

16:10.492 --> 16:12.161
You know, I always assumed

16:12.194 --> 16:14.263
that this place
was just paper and grapes,

16:14.297 --> 16:17.667
but I can see that it's so much more.

16:17.699 --> 16:19.968
Fixing is his love language.

16:20.001 --> 16:20.870
- Ohh.
- Ah.

16:20.903 --> 16:22.337
My what now?

16:22.370 --> 16:23.773
Oh, it's how you show people you care.

16:23.806 --> 16:25.742
Right?

16:25.774 --> 16:28.043
But, you know, since we're on the topic,

16:28.077 --> 16:30.446
maybe you can get your love languages

16:30.479 --> 16:33.183
to help you pay your Winebrary bills

16:33.216 --> 16:35.818
so Poppy can pay hers.

16:35.851 --> 16:37.386
Eh.

16:38.955 --> 16:41.057
What are they doing?

16:41.090 --> 16:43.993
Are they gonna turn into
one giant Winebrarian?

16:44.025 --> 16:45.962
No, this is good.

16:45.995 --> 16:47.297
They're considering it.

16:47.330 --> 16:48.731
This is how they decided

16:48.764 --> 16:52.034
to let Miggy join their full
moon drum circle last month.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.136
How often are you here, Sophie?

16:54.169 --> 16:55.137
A lot.

16:55.170 --> 16:56.438
My dad had a girlfriend last year,

16:56.471 --> 16:59.007
so really lost track of me.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.643
Man, I can't believe someone
named Dolores works here

17:01.677 --> 17:03.712
and she needed two new hips.

17:03.746 --> 17:07.181
Yeah. I guess that's why
that lie came out so smooth.

17:07.236 --> 17:09.671
I'm not a master storyteller.

17:09.704 --> 17:11.141
I'm just a really bad person.

17:11.173 --> 17:12.241
This sucks.

17:12.275 --> 17:14.310
We stole that money fair and square.

17:14.343 --> 17:16.378
She just took it.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.147
Honestly, I think she's faking.

17:18.180 --> 17:20.816
You know, episode 109 of "Gavel Town,"

17:20.849 --> 17:22.584
"Innocent Until Proven Filthy."

17:22.617 --> 17:24.587
- So basically, the...
- Rory, not right now, okay?

17:24.619 --> 17:26.388
We are in crisis mode!

17:26.421 --> 17:27.923
Hey, my calendars!

17:30.125 --> 17:32.895
Oh, my God.

17:32.929 --> 17:35.297
He's covering his junk
with my work cardigan.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.500
I love it!

17:38.534 --> 17:41.204
He's bench-pressing my chair!

17:41.237 --> 17:42.438
In June!

17:42.470 --> 17:44.207
- That's... That's my birth month!
- I know.

17:44.239 --> 17:45.474
This calendar is about all of us.

17:45.507 --> 17:47.576
I gotta have one. How much?

17:47.610 --> 17:49.545
- 20 bucks a pop?
- Sold.

17:49.578 --> 17:51.580
Yeah, I-I can do that.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.615
- I can do that.
- Yeah.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.710
Miggy, we can charge double
if they're signed.

17:56.751 --> 17:57.917
- Oh.
- Start signing.

17:57.942 --> 17:59.245
Show these kids how to
forge your signature.

17:59.270 --> 18:00.221
Okay, okay.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.893
- Hey!
- Douglas.

18:03.926 --> 18:05.014
What a day.

18:05.039 --> 18:06.262
Oh, you're so peppy.

18:06.295 --> 18:07.663
So, you must have gotten the rent?

18:07.697 --> 18:10.800
Nope.
In fact, I lost money today.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.735
Got a parking ticket downtown.

18:12.767 --> 18:15.237
That curb was a big girl.
She was red as hell.

18:15.270 --> 18:17.139
So, why are you happy?

18:17.172 --> 18:18.974
Because I remembered I'm resilient.

18:19.007 --> 18:20.476
I mean, I'll figure out a way

18:20.508 --> 18:21.877
to pay for this place.

18:21.910 --> 18:23.947
Maybe, you know,
get a small business loan,

18:23.979 --> 18:25.582
or start serving cheese.

18:25.614 --> 18:27.249
Wine and cheese is a thing, right?

18:27.283 --> 18:28.685
Listen to me.

18:28.718 --> 18:31.054
There is no way that
you're losing this business...

18:31.086 --> 18:32.855
not if I have anything to say about it.

18:32.889 --> 18:35.158
That's right. I'm a convert.

18:35.190 --> 18:37.492
- I love it here.
- Say what now?

18:37.526 --> 18:39.562
I don't know, maybe it's a combination

18:39.594 --> 18:41.663
of knowledge and alcohol because I...

18:41.697 --> 18:43.433
All right, no. You know what?

18:43.466 --> 18:45.767
I'm not gonna mansplain
your business to you.

18:45.801 --> 18:47.237
You know why it's great.

18:47.269 --> 18:49.939
Oh, my God. I am very
turned on right now.

18:49.971 --> 18:50.939
Oh?

18:50.972 --> 18:52.274
And also a little concerned.

18:52.307 --> 18:54.410
Did you vape with Fran
in the alley? Fran!

18:54.442 --> 18:56.311
I only vape in the restroom now!

18:56.344 --> 18:59.815
Poppy, you have built this
business from the ground up.

18:59.849 --> 19:01.618
And also there's an army of people

19:01.651 --> 19:04.320
who will fight to make sure
that you can keep it going.

19:04.353 --> 19:07.257
Now, I have been drinking Chardonnay

19:07.289 --> 19:08.590
for the past six hours,

19:08.623 --> 19:09.926
and I need to lie down.

19:09.959 --> 19:11.126
- Okay.
- Stop!

19:11.160 --> 19:12.415
Don't lock it down!

19:12.440 --> 19:15.297
Miggy, there's no bulldozer.
It's just a rent increase.

19:15.331 --> 19:16.799
I know. I tried to explain it,

19:16.832 --> 19:19.135
but he just really wanted
to see a bulldozer today.

19:19.168 --> 19:22.372
Poppy, we come bearing gifts.

19:22.404 --> 19:24.306
We are proud to present to you
this gift of...

19:24.340 --> 19:26.175
Oh, my God, you talk slow.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.244
Here you go, Mom.

19:30.712 --> 19:32.014
Money?

19:32.047 --> 19:34.217
Oh, my gosh, you guys!

19:34.249 --> 19:36.986
How did you...

19:37.018 --> 19:38.320
Thank you.

19:38.353 --> 19:40.055
Yeah, as much
as I'd like to take credit,

19:40.089 --> 19:42.592
this one was all Miggy.

19:42.624 --> 19:44.059
Guys, this calendar is making me

19:44.093 --> 19:46.696
reconsider my stance
on heterosexual sex.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.131
And office work.

19:49.731 --> 19:50.833
Check this mess...

19:50.865 --> 19:53.969
we are going to start
paying for our drinks now.

19:54.003 --> 19:56.105
- With usable cash?
- Mm-hmm.

19:56.138 --> 19:57.407
Like, money?

19:57.439 --> 19:58.908
Real money.

19:58.940 --> 20:02.210
This means so much to me.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.913
Thank you, guys.

20:03.946 --> 20:05.415
I really appreciate it.

20:05.448 --> 20:06.748
We got your back, Poppy!

20:06.782 --> 20:09.014
No one yells the thing
we're all thinking like Miggy.

20:09.039 --> 20:10.519
- Damn right!
- We love you.

20:10.553 --> 20:12.055
- We love you, Poppy!
- We love you.

20:13.189 --> 20:14.590
And, you know, not to be that guy,

20:14.622 --> 20:17.559
but Rory spilled my salad earlier.

20:17.593 --> 20:19.295
It was $15.95.

20:19.327 --> 20:20.621
You ruined it.

20:22.465 --> 20:23.965
Hello!

20:24.074 --> 20:25.878
Damn it.
I thought I was ready.

20:25.903 --> 20:28.606
- "Hi, Tracy," is what I meant to say.
- Hi, Will.

20:28.638 --> 20:30.707
That was a really good Mrs. Doubtfire.

20:30.740 --> 20:32.442
Oh, I know.

20:32.475 --> 20:36.013
Hey, would you like to get
coffee with me sometime?

20:36.047 --> 20:37.048
Just as friends?

20:37.080 --> 20:39.149
Are you sure you're not too busy

20:39.183 --> 20:40.718
trying to land Gary's plane?

20:40.750 --> 20:42.220
Can I be honest with you?

20:42.252 --> 20:44.422
- Gary does not exist.
- What?

20:44.454 --> 20:46.490
- Yeah.
- I am shook!

20:46.523 --> 20:48.558
- I'm so sorry I've been so weird.
- Ahh.

20:48.592 --> 20:51.796
I-I just... I've never
worked with an ex before.

20:51.828 --> 20:54.898
Me neither! I can't believe
I dated a co-worker.

20:54.932 --> 20:56.567
- Mm-hmm.
- Why didn't my friends stop me?

20:56.599 --> 20:58.035
That is exactly what I've been saying.

20:58.068 --> 20:59.436
There's too much interaction,

20:59.470 --> 21:00.975
especially when we're both
obsessed with toast.

21:00.999 --> 21:03.341
Right? Hey, are you thrown off
by the fact that the new toaster

21:03.374 --> 21:05.843
goes all the way to 10,
so now 5 is medium-brown

21:05.875 --> 21:07.147
as opposed to the most brown?

21:07.202 --> 21:08.871
It has ruined my life!

21:10.647 --> 21:12.817
Hey, you guys hear?

21:12.849 --> 21:14.685
Will and Tracy broke up.

21:14.719 --> 21:17.818
I'm Guy McCormick, and that's the news.

21:20.090 --> 21:21.458
Oh, dear.
