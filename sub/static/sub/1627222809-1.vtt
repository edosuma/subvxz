00:36.663 --> 00:37.664
Let's go.

00:38.597 --> 00:39.598
Hurry it up.

00:41.433 --> 00:43.636
Let's go. Come on.
Two blind mice.

00:45.404 --> 00:46.438
Let's go, Jimmy.

00:53.278 --> 00:54.312
Come on.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.819
Chicken shit.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.620
- Right here, Jimmy.
- Line them up.

01:01.654 --> 01:02.889
Fucking pussies.

01:02.922 --> 01:05.825
Gentleman, when you feel your
brother tap you on the shoulder,

01:05.858 --> 01:07.827
tilt your fucking head back,

01:07.860 --> 01:10.295
open those pretty
little mouths of yours,

01:10.328 --> 01:12.230
and take a drink-ey!

01:12.264 --> 01:17.369
If you cannot hold your liquor,
you will not be in the Pi Xi Brotherhood.

01:18.603 --> 01:21.741
It's a liquid picnic, boys.
Who's thirsty?

01:23.275 --> 01:24.509
Come on, open your mouth.

01:27.279 --> 01:28.413
Hold on, hold on.

01:30.016 --> 01:32.217
I don't think funny boy's
had enough to drink.

01:36.421 --> 01:37.657
What do you think, funny boy?

01:38.523 --> 01:39.524
You want another?

01:40.525 --> 01:41.526
Open up.

01:45.363 --> 01:46.364
Comedian.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.470
Gentlemen,
let's take a nature walk.

01:52.772 --> 01:56.709
Boys, follow Steven.
Don't fucking trip.

01:56.743 --> 01:58.610
Don't be a fucking spazz.
Let's go.

02:09.955 --> 02:12.024
<i>♪ Walking in the woods ♪</i>

02:17.864 --> 02:20.032
- That's it, boys.
- All right, brothers.

02:22.001 --> 02:23.502
Get the fuck up!

02:23.535 --> 02:24.536
Come on.

02:25.671 --> 02:26.806
Wire style.

02:28.741 --> 02:31.376
All right, choir, boys.
Take a fucking knee.

02:33.378 --> 02:35.447
Take a fucking knee.

02:38.851 --> 02:39.852
Right.

02:41.353 --> 02:42.955
You wanna be here,

02:42.989 --> 02:45.557
a part of this brotherhood,
a part of this fraternity,

02:46.759 --> 02:48.360
then this is what we have to do.

02:49.796 --> 02:50.797
Now,

02:52.364 --> 02:54.399
if you'd like that dream
to be a reality,

02:55.868 --> 02:56.869
you will chant

02:57.837 --> 02:58.938
the oath of Xi.

03:01.540 --> 03:02.842
Fucking say it.

03:02.875 --> 03:06.578
Three fucking times.
Say the fucking oath of Xi now.

03:06.611 --> 03:10.883
I believe in the importance of
lifelong friendships, loyalty and virtue.

03:10.917 --> 03:11.951
Louder!

03:11.984 --> 03:14.586
I will forever honor
our founding fathers.

03:14.619 --> 03:16.789
I pledge to carry out
the virtues of the Pi Xi...

03:16.823 --> 03:19.591
- Fucking louder!
- ...to the best of my ability.

03:19.624 --> 03:24.563
I believe in the importance of lifelong
friendships, loyalty and virtue.

03:24.596 --> 03:27.465
I will forever honor
our founding fathers!

03:27.499 --> 03:32.805
I pledge to carry out the virtues of
the Pi Xi to the best of my ability.

03:32.839 --> 03:34.774
Keep it going!

03:34.807 --> 03:38.911
I'll tell you when to fucking stop!
I'll tell you when to fucking stop!

03:38.945 --> 03:41.948
- Louder!
- I will forever honor our founding fathers.

03:41.981 --> 03:46.686
I pledge to carry out the virtues of
the Pi Xi to the best of my ability.

04:06.138 --> 04:07.439
Take your blindfolds off.

04:08.506 --> 04:10.442
Fuck!

04:10.475 --> 04:12.111
- They fucking left.
- They totally left us.

04:14.947 --> 04:16.115
Where'd we come from, guys?

04:16.815 --> 04:18.583
I don't know.

04:18.617 --> 04:20.685
Does anyone have any idea?

04:20.720 --> 04:21.954
That's fucking disgusting.

04:23.022 --> 04:24.023
Sorry.

04:27.727 --> 04:28.928
Let's go this way.

04:31.130 --> 04:32.899
Let's fucking go
somewhere, guys.

04:41.674 --> 04:43.976
- Shoot.
- What's the matter?

04:44.010 --> 04:45.510
Sorry.

04:45.543 --> 04:47.146
Dropped my cellphone.

04:47.179 --> 04:48.881
Oh, God.

04:48.915 --> 04:51.651
Oh, God. Oh.

04:53.753 --> 04:56.554
I gotta turn the light on, Jim.
I can't see.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.090
Uh, what time is it?

04:58.124 --> 05:01.627
- Oh, it's like 6:30.
- 6:30?

05:01.661 --> 05:03.195
You know, I thought it was
the middle of the night.

05:03.229 --> 05:05.831
Here it is. Oh.

05:05.865 --> 05:07.633
It was right in front of me.

05:07.667 --> 05:11.871
You gotta learn how to turn down the sound on
that when you're texting on that dumb thing.

05:11.904 --> 05:16.008
I know, I gotta get the kids to show me how
to do that. I don't know how to do that.

05:16.042 --> 05:18.576
- Can you turn off that light, please?
- Oh, sorry, hon.

05:19.845 --> 05:21.479
You know, what I'm gonna do?

05:21.513 --> 05:22.715
I'm gonna go down.

05:22.748 --> 05:24.616
Wait, did you remember
to get bread?

05:24.650 --> 05:25.685
Yeah. It's on the counter.

05:25.718 --> 05:27.820
Okay, good. I'm gonna go down
and say my rosary.

05:27.853 --> 05:29.221
and let you sleep
for 10 minutes.

05:29.255 --> 05:31.589
Did you hear anything
from Jimmy?

05:31.623 --> 05:33.759
I don't know.
I can't see this stupid thing.

05:34.559 --> 05:35.728
Use your readers.

05:35.761 --> 05:38.030
I lost the dumb readers.

05:38.064 --> 05:39.531
- I can't see.
- Use mine.

05:39.564 --> 05:41.499
Oh, thanks, hon.

05:41.901 --> 05:42.902
Oh.

05:44.602 --> 05:46.739
Oh, God. Yours are
so much better than mine.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.276
- Darn it.
- What?

05:50.309 --> 05:52.044
Text at 3:00 a.m.
in the morning.

05:52.078 --> 05:53.611
What the hell, Jim?

05:53.646 --> 05:55.815
What is he doing up
till 3:00 a.m. in the morning?

05:55.848 --> 05:59.551
Oh, relax. He's probably
watching <i>Monday Night Football.</i>

06:00.286 --> 06:02.587
- What?
- He's watching football.

06:02.620 --> 06:06.125
Well, how the hell late
does <i>Monday Night Football</i> go?

06:06.158 --> 06:08.995
And he was supposed to call me
to go over that mission thing.

06:09.929 --> 06:11.630
You gotta leave the boy alone.

06:11.664 --> 06:12.698
I am leaving him alone, Jim.

06:12.732 --> 06:14.967
I just wanna help him
go over the pledge thing.

06:16.235 --> 06:17.803
Maybe he doesn't want you
to help.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.241
I know. I just...

06:22.274 --> 06:24.176
don't want him to get nervous
and forget.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.646
He's not gonna get nervous
and forget.

06:28.848 --> 06:30.615
Can you stop?

06:30.649 --> 06:32.952
Never should've sent him this year.
That was so stupid.

06:32.985 --> 06:34.720
Can you stop, please?

06:34.754 --> 06:36.655
I thought you said you were gonna
let me sleep for another 10.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.958
You know who I blame?

06:40.126 --> 06:41.160
Who?

06:41.193 --> 06:43.129
That asshole, Miss Higgins.

06:43.162 --> 06:44.830
- Who?
- His Pre-K teacher.

06:44.864 --> 06:49.635
The fat one. Miss Higgins that you said
would've been pretty if she wasn't so fat.

06:49.668 --> 06:52.905
Remember she called me the day
of kindergarten registration

06:52.938 --> 06:55.241
and she said Jimmy should not be
staying back in pre-K

06:55.274 --> 06:58.310
because he was
way too socially advanced,

06:58.344 --> 07:01.579
and then he was way too young for
kindergarten, way too young for first grade.

07:01.613 --> 07:03.649
He couldn't even read,
and now he's way too young for college.

07:03.682 --> 07:04.683
This is a disaster, Jim.

07:04.717 --> 07:07.653
If I have a heart attack,
it's because of you.

07:07.686 --> 07:10.089
Jim, I swear to God,
if you have a heart attack, we're screwed.

07:10.122 --> 07:12.158
I have zero skills.

07:12.191 --> 07:13.692
What the hell would I do?

07:13.726 --> 07:15.761
You gotta stop.

07:15.795 --> 07:18.164
I thought you were gonna
let me sleep for another 10.

07:18.197 --> 07:20.699
You know what I should do, Jim?

07:20.733 --> 07:22.968
I should start a novena to St. Augustine.

07:23.002 --> 07:25.071
'Cause apparently
he was a big asshole, too.

07:39.852 --> 07:42.088
I pray now for my family
and for peace in the world.

07:42.121 --> 07:44.890
Especially for Jim, Jimmy,
Kelly, Ciara, Sean.

07:46.292 --> 07:48.027
And all those who are suffering.

07:48.060 --> 07:50.196
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

07:50.229 --> 07:51.730
Blessed art thou amongst women,

07:51.764 --> 07:54.700
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God...

07:54.733 --> 07:57.670
Shit! Damn it. Sorry.

07:57.703 --> 08:00.306
I have to make the lunches. Stupid thing.

08:03.876 --> 08:06.979
Okay. Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

08:07.012 --> 08:08.280
Blessed art thou amongst women,

08:08.314 --> 08:10.416
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb...

08:10.449 --> 08:12.651
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

08:12.685 --> 08:15.221
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

08:15.254 --> 08:19.024
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

08:19.058 --> 08:21.827
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee...

08:21.861 --> 08:22.962
Sorry. Damn it!

08:25.264 --> 08:26.565
Kids!

08:26.599 --> 08:29.135
Kelly, Ciara, if you wanna take
showers, you gotta do it now.

08:31.337 --> 08:34.707
You gotta do it right now,
if you want showers, guys.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.275
Seany, you can sleep
10 more minutes.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.943
Kelly and Ciara,
have the decency to answer your mother.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.047
Answer your mother!

08:42.081 --> 08:44.416
Nice. Kelly and Ciara,
now you woke your father.

08:44.450 --> 08:46.018
Get up! Rise and shine, guys.

08:46.051 --> 08:47.953
Rise and shine.
You're gonna be late.

08:49.788 --> 08:51.090
The neighbors
hate us. Go.

08:51.123 --> 08:52.758
- Come on. Hustle! Hustle!
- Hurry up!

08:52.791 --> 08:55.094
My, God, Kelly, put the top down.
You look like a hooker.

08:55.127 --> 08:56.962
- Kelly, put the top down.
- Oh, my God, Mom.

08:56.996 --> 08:59.031
- What, Sean?
- Mom, said you're making me late.

08:59.064 --> 09:00.399
Ciara, skirt down.

09:00.432 --> 09:02.301
You are so annoying.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.403
How am I annoying?
Mom said call.

09:04.436 --> 09:06.272
Okay, listen.
Let's be nice.

09:06.305 --> 09:09.441
Start nice. Start the day off nice
and fresh. We're not gonna fight.

09:10.042 --> 09:11.343
All right?

09:11.377 --> 09:14.747
Now, kids, let's call Jimmy
and see if he's up.

09:14.780 --> 09:17.249
- Mom!
- What? I just wanna make sure he's up for class.

09:17.283 --> 09:18.817
He's definitely not.

09:18.851 --> 09:20.386
Okay. How do you
know that, Kelly?

09:20.419 --> 09:23.022
Mom, you call every day.
He's not stupid.

09:23.055 --> 09:26.859
He knows it's you calling from my phone.
So why don't you just call him yourself?

09:26.892 --> 09:29.094
Do me a favor,
and just once,

09:29.128 --> 09:31.964
you follow the one rule that I've been
teaching you since you were a kid,

09:31.997 --> 09:36.001
and honor your mother and father
and call your brother Jimmy.

09:36.035 --> 09:38.304
Or I swear to God, Kelly,
you know what I'm gonna do?

09:38.337 --> 09:40.906
- I'm taking the phone away from you permanently.
- No you will not.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.875
- Shut up, Ciara.
- Okay, Ciara. You know what?

09:42.908 --> 09:46.912
Seriously, that is really
annoying, so please don't chime in.

09:46.946 --> 09:48.380
And, Kelly,
I'm gonna tell you something.

09:48.414 --> 09:51.817
If you're ugly on the inside,
pretty on the outside, no one likes you.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.519
So you know what?
Call your brother Jimmy.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.921
Mom, when I'm in college,
I'll answer.

09:55.955 --> 09:57.756
Shut up, Sean!

09:57.790 --> 10:01.060
That's not okay. It's so early,
and that kind of talk is just sad.

10:01.093 --> 10:02.294
And you know what, Sean?

10:03.162 --> 10:04.163
What?

10:05.197 --> 10:06.198
You get to call Jimmy.

10:21.814 --> 10:23.349
- Yeah.
- <i>Hi, it's Mom.</i>

10:23.650 --> 10:25.217
I know.

10:25.251 --> 10:29.088
- How'd you know?
- <i>'Cause you call me every day.</i>

10:29.121 --> 10:31.323
You know what, Jimmy. You're really
lucky that I call you every day

10:31.357 --> 10:32.925
because you wanna
know something?

10:32.958 --> 10:34.994
People in Tijuana
have no one to call them

10:35.027 --> 10:39.164
because they live in tires and
they have no phone reception.

10:39.198 --> 10:40.833
<i>So why don't you feel lucky?</i>

10:40.866 --> 10:42.268
<i>And you know what?</i>

10:42.301 --> 10:44.303
<i>I got the kids here,
and we all just want to say we love you.</i>

10:44.336 --> 10:46.572
<i>We hope your...
Guys, say, "We love you" to Jimmy.</i>

10:46.605 --> 10:49.441
- Hi, Jimmy.
- "We love you, Jimmy."

10:49.475 --> 10:51.343
<i>Hi, you guys.</i>

10:51.377 --> 10:53.379
Why don't you all
talk to Vergil?

10:54.313 --> 10:56.315
Hi, Vergil.

10:56.348 --> 10:59.818
Oh, Hey, guys.
Uh, good morning, Mrs. O'Brien.

10:59.852 --> 11:01.220
<i>Good morning, honey.</i>

11:01.253 --> 11:02.821
<i>We're just checking to make
sure you boys are up for class.</i>

11:02.855 --> 11:06.959
Oh, yeah, we are totally,
100% up. Um...

11:06.992 --> 11:12.197
Jimmy was just at the gym doing crunches,
and, uh, we're hitting the books now.

11:12.231 --> 11:14.466
<i>That's good, Jimmy.
Mind, body and spirit.</i>

11:15.367 --> 11:17.269
- <i>Jimmy?</i>
- Yeah.

11:17.303 --> 11:18.404
Are you really up for class?

11:18.437 --> 11:21.040
<i>Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
No, I just got out of the shower.</i>

11:21.073 --> 11:23.008
<i>I'm actually about to rush out
the door right now to go to class.</i>

11:23.042 --> 11:25.044
Wait, wait. Before you rush out
the door to class, listen to me.

11:25.077 --> 11:27.346
I want you to say that pledge
thing one more time, hon.

11:27.379 --> 11:29.948
Because you gotta know it cold.
And if you practice it today,

11:29.982 --> 11:32.584
tonight you'll be like, "Thank
God, Mom had me say it today."

11:32.618 --> 11:36.355
- Do I actually have to?
- <i>Yes.</i>

11:36.388 --> 11:42.294
All right. I believe in the importance of
lifelong friendships, loyalty and virtue.

11:42.328 --> 11:45.331
Jim. "Virtue."
Hit it. Hit the T's.

11:45.364 --> 11:48.067
And remember I told you, hit the T's.
Enunciate. Go ahead.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.370
I pledge to carry out
the, uh, virtue

11:51.403 --> 11:54.940
<i>of the Pi Xis to the best of my
ability, and, uh...</i>

11:57.443 --> 12:00.012
<i>Always living...</i>

12:00.045 --> 12:06.919
Always living by the guide
of... honor and virtue,

12:06.952 --> 12:09.054
love and friendship
of my fellow brothers

12:09.088 --> 12:10.356
and the brothers
that came before me.

12:10.389 --> 12:12.257
<i>Yeah, Jimmy. Frat boy!</i>

12:12.291 --> 12:14.293
Jimmy! Frat boy!

12:14.326 --> 12:16.261
Nice, Jimmy Frat Boy.

12:17.162 --> 12:20.132
Jimmy... Jimmy, seriously,
I'm not kidding,

12:20.165 --> 12:23.469
that was so good and I'm so proud of you.
I told you you could memorize.

12:23.502 --> 12:25.404
You didn't think you could
memorize, 'cause that teacher

12:25.437 --> 12:28.207
knocked your confidence in high
school, but you can memorize, son.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.743
All right, I'm gonna go.

12:29.776 --> 12:32.211
<i>Don't go yet. Wait. I've one more
thing I'm gonna tell you, okay?</i>

12:32.244 --> 12:33.912
I'm just pulling up
to the school.

12:33.946 --> 12:35.147
Oh, my God. There's Sister...

12:35.180 --> 12:37.082
You guys gotta hustle.
Get your bags together.

12:37.116 --> 12:38.450
Where the hell is your phone?

12:38.484 --> 12:41.420
Okay. Okay. All right. All right, go guys.
Go, go, go, go, go!

12:41.453 --> 12:43.222
Seany, I'm just gonna
keep your phone.

12:43.255 --> 12:44.423
One more sec...
Oh, damn it.

12:44.456 --> 12:46.392
Just go out.
Slide it shut.

12:47.694 --> 12:50.129
<i>Seany, I'm gonna keep
your phone, okay, doll?</i>

12:50.162 --> 12:51.964
- <i>You do this every day, Mom.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

12:51.997 --> 12:53.332
Just go to school,
you're late.

12:53.365 --> 12:55.702
Sorry, Sister.
Oh, God. We're so late.

12:55.735 --> 12:57.936
Yeah. You know
I can hear you, right?

12:57.970 --> 12:59.972
- <i>Okay, well, it's true.</i>
- <i>So listen...</i>

13:00.005 --> 13:02.675
<i>You gentlemen wanna be Pi
Xi, you're gonna have to bleed...</i>

13:04.009 --> 13:05.177
<i>for Pi Xi.</i>

13:05.678 --> 13:07.479
Fuck you.

13:07.513 --> 13:09.548
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Nothing.

13:09.581 --> 13:13.385
What the fuck'd you say, Jimmy?
What's so fucking funny, Jimmy?

13:13.419 --> 13:14.586
Get the fuck down!

13:14.620 --> 13:16.622
Get on the fucking ground.

13:17.757 --> 13:19.358
Okay, let's go!

13:19.391 --> 13:21.026
Get on the ground, everyone.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.000
Let's go, Jimmy.
Let's go!

13:28.033 --> 13:31.069
You annoying
fucking bitch! Let's go!

13:36.743 --> 13:38.610
I don't think
you want it enough.

13:41.447 --> 13:44.216
I don't think you should be in
this fucking house right now.

13:44.249 --> 13:46.318
This is fucking pathetic!
Crawl!

13:46.351 --> 13:47.921
Get the fuck up.
Get the fuck up.

13:47.953 --> 13:51.356
This is what we're gonna do. I want you
all fucking pansies to come over here.

13:51.390 --> 13:54.560
Get the fuck over there.
This is what we're gonna do.

13:54.593 --> 13:57.296
Fuck, boys.
Get on the other side.

13:57.329 --> 13:59.398
<i>I want you to put your fucking
shoulders next to each...</i>

13:59.431 --> 14:01.333
<i>Go around me, you asshole!</i>

14:01.366 --> 14:03.636
- Mom.
- <i>What?</i>

14:03.670 --> 14:06.505
<i>You say, "I believe in virtue."
Do you know what that means?</i>

14:06.538 --> 14:08.307
Yeah. Yeah.

14:08.340 --> 14:10.108
- <i>Okay. What does it mean?</i>
- Um...

14:12.812 --> 14:15.147
Mom, I know what it means.

14:15.180 --> 14:17.650
- <i>Huh?</i>
- I know. I know what it means.

14:17.684 --> 14:20.419
<i>Okay. It means
"get your ass to mass."</i>

14:20.452 --> 14:22.287
I'm... I'm in a rush.

14:25.524 --> 14:26.659
<i>Get your ass up!</i>

14:29.061 --> 14:32.431
What do you fucking saying? You're
lollygagging over here? Fuck you!

14:32.464 --> 14:35.802
Don't fucking look at me.
Don't fucking look at me!

14:35.835 --> 14:37.436
He's such an asshole.

14:37.469 --> 14:39.238
I like this.
This is nice.

14:39.271 --> 14:40.740
Maybe we could stay here
all night.

14:42.107 --> 14:44.409
Wouldn't you like that?
That'd be fun.

14:44.443 --> 14:47.212
- That'd be pretty fun if we just stayed here all night.
- Shut the fuck up, dude.

14:47.246 --> 14:49.749
- Shut up, Jimmy. Shut up.
- Why won't he shut the fuck up?

14:49.782 --> 14:52.484
You're not the fucking comedian
anymore, baby.

14:52.518 --> 14:55.420
I'll show you who's funny.
Get out your phone, Vinny.

14:55.454 --> 14:56.689
Jimmy loves to fucking talk.

14:56.723 --> 15:00.092
This guy just thinks he's the
funniest motherfucker in town.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.694
I'll show you
who's fucking funny.

15:01.728 --> 15:03.395
What the fuck, dude?

15:03.428 --> 15:05.097
You got
fucking piss on you.

15:07.232 --> 15:08.600
You're our fucking bitch.

15:15.675 --> 15:18.678
- Just hurry the fuck up, dude!
- Shut the fuck up.

15:18.711 --> 15:23.750
Next time, you don't fucking make
jokes because I'm the comedian here.

15:23.783 --> 15:26.585
I'm the fucking funny guy here.
You got that?

15:26.618 --> 15:29.154
You're gonna be a great Pi Xi.

15:29.187 --> 15:31.156
I cannot believe
that fucking guy pissed on me!

15:31.189 --> 15:32.759
It's okay, Jimmy.
Calm down.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.827
No, it's so fucking okay.
That's crossing the fucking line, dude!

15:34.861 --> 15:37.529
Seriously? And why me, like,
what the fuck did I do?

15:37.563 --> 15:38.865
We're crawling
through fucking glass!

15:38.898 --> 15:41.133
What's going on here?
You guys all right?

15:41.166 --> 15:43.101
No, we're not all right.
I'm gonna fucking kill that guy.

15:43.135 --> 15:45.838
Take it easy, bro. Relax.
It's just gonna be a fucking memory.

15:45.872 --> 15:47.239
Yeah. Bad memory.

15:47.272 --> 15:48.675
Come on, guys.
We gotta go.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.643
Let's get out of here. This guy is
fucking crazy. Come on. Let's go.

15:51.878 --> 15:53.445
Is there something wrong
with me?

15:53.478 --> 15:55.514
Ciara, how do you do this?

15:55.547 --> 15:57.282
- Stop.
- Okay, you do that.

15:57.316 --> 15:58.751
Oh, honey.

15:58.785 --> 16:02.689
Oh, wait, wait.
Don't put it all away. I love this.

16:02.722 --> 16:04.691
I love salt potatoes.
They're my weakness.

16:05.490 --> 16:06.491
I'm such a fatty.

16:07.627 --> 16:09.696
- Do me a favor.
- What?

16:09.729 --> 16:12.765
- Can you call Jimmy for me?
- Mom.

16:12.799 --> 16:14.566
Do what your mother
asked for.

16:15.702 --> 16:17.770
- She's driving us crazy.
- Yes.

16:17.804 --> 16:19.706
- Me too.
- Jim.

16:19.739 --> 16:21.908
- "Call Jimmy."
- Oh, nice.

16:21.941 --> 16:24.376
Put him on speaker.
It's on speaker?

16:24.409 --> 16:27.412
- <i>Sean?</i>
- Hey, what's up? Mom wanted me to call you.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.380
Hi, Jimmy.

16:28.413 --> 16:32.852
- Hey, Mrs. O'Brien.
- <i>Hi, Vergil.</i>

16:32.885 --> 16:35.454
- <i>How are you, hon?</i>
- Your boy looks real nice.

16:35.487 --> 16:37.522
Hey, congratulations.

16:37.556 --> 16:39.558
You guys made it.
This is great.

16:39.591 --> 16:41.861
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Mr. O'Brien.

16:41.894 --> 16:43.730
<i>Hey, after the initiation,</i>

16:43.763 --> 16:46.298
<i>text your mother,
'cause she's driving me crazy. All right?</i>

16:46.331 --> 16:48.500
No, wait, wait.
Jimmy, don't text me, call me.

16:48.533 --> 16:51.904
Now, listen. When you do that,
that speech...

16:51.938 --> 16:54.439
The pledge...
You just do what I told you.

16:54.473 --> 16:57.877
Just say it right out 'cause you got
it, honey. We worked on it.

16:57.910 --> 17:01.480
You just gotta enunciate.
Do not mumble.

17:01.513 --> 17:04.583
All right. Okay. Love you, Mom.
I'll talk to you later.

17:05.718 --> 17:06.719
He hung up.

17:09.521 --> 17:11.723
- That is such an asshole move.
- Mom.

17:11.758 --> 17:12.892
It is.

17:12.925 --> 17:15.662
I believe
in the importance of virtue.

17:15.694 --> 17:21.400
I believe in loyalty, friendship and the honor
our founding fathers have bestowed upon us.

17:21.433 --> 17:25.237
I pledge to carry out
the virtues of the Pi Xis,

17:25.270 --> 17:28.808
living each day under virtues
of my fellow brothers

17:28.841 --> 17:30.777
and the brothers
that have gone before me.

17:36.615 --> 17:38.785
Brothers,
pin your pledges.

17:55.935 --> 17:58.503
Gentlemen, it's time to unplug.

18:07.714 --> 18:09.716
Let's fucking party, yeah?

18:17.924 --> 18:20.693
Pi Xi! Pi Xi!
Pi Xi! Pi Xi!

18:21.526 --> 18:22.527
I'm so worried.

18:26.364 --> 18:28.701
You know,
I looked at his canvas.

18:30.368 --> 18:31.369
It's not good.

18:33.039 --> 18:34.874
What the hell's a canvas?

18:34.907 --> 18:36.943
It's the thing where, like,

18:36.976 --> 18:39.946
in college you can look at their grades or
their attendance if you have their code.

18:43.548 --> 18:44.549
Is he failing?

18:45.084 --> 18:46.986
No.

18:47.019 --> 18:48.888
But he's definitely skipping,
I can tell.

18:49.922 --> 18:51.490
Which makes me so mad.

18:52.524 --> 18:53.693
You work so hard.

18:55.094 --> 18:57.764
Paying that tuition,
the fricking kid's skipping.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.335
Jim, you should call him.

19:04.402 --> 19:06.839
He's fine.
Gets through rush...

19:08.340 --> 19:09.541
get in that frat.

19:11.077 --> 19:14.814
It'll be the best thing for him.
They won't let him skip class.

19:15.614 --> 19:17.516
Trust me.

19:17.549 --> 19:19.652
They turn boys into men.

19:35.868 --> 19:37.870
Man!

19:40.139 --> 19:42.407
Come on, dawg.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.744
Who runs with
their hands in their pockets?

19:44.777 --> 19:46.478
- What's up?
- Stevie.

19:46.511 --> 19:47.947
- Stevie.
- How you doing, baby?

19:47.980 --> 19:50.415
- How are you?
- Good. Let me get some shit.

19:50.448 --> 19:53.786
- You sipping tonight?
- Eh, got some shit going on.

19:53.820 --> 19:54.821
Mmm-hmm.

19:55.755 --> 19:57.355
Uh, how much?

19:57.389 --> 20:00.793
Shoot me $75 for the coke,
and shoot me $18 for the Xanax.

20:00.827 --> 20:04.563
DZ...
DZL... All right, fellows.

20:04.596 --> 20:07.099
I'll see you later.
You have a good night.

20:14.140 --> 20:17.009
Jimmy. Jimmy, Jimmy!
What's up, bud?

20:17.043 --> 20:18.476
I'm gonna take care
of you, all right?

20:18.510 --> 20:21.714
- All right.
- You're gonna be a good one. I'm really glad you're here.

20:21.747 --> 20:22.849
- Good.
- Okay?

20:22.882 --> 20:24.083
- I'm glad to be here.
- You're good.

20:24.116 --> 20:27.787
Just man the fuck up, all right?
Just man the fuck up.

20:28.721 --> 20:30.422
I'm thirsty.

20:50.209 --> 20:52.144
Hey. How you doing, bud?

20:52.178 --> 20:53.946
Welcome to the brotherhood.

20:53.980 --> 20:55.047
- Hey, drink.
- Cheers.

21:00.518 --> 21:02.188
Yeah! That's my boy.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.556
Tucker, bring us shots
over here.

21:04.589 --> 21:06.424
- We're doing some shots, all right?
- No, I'm good.

21:06.458 --> 21:09.128
We're gonna take a shot.
Pi Xi, baby! This is what we do.

21:09.161 --> 21:13.565
Here you go, man.
One for you, one for me.

21:13.598 --> 21:15.533
- Welcome, baby!
- Yeah, Pi Xi!

21:17.703 --> 21:19.839
- Pi Xi!
- Pi Xi!

21:19.872 --> 21:22.474
We're fucking doing
another one. Let's do it.

21:22.507 --> 21:25.510
- Come on. Boom!
- Pi Xi.

21:27.847 --> 21:30.515
One more.
My man

21:36.789 --> 21:40.458
You all right?
Come on man up, baby, man up.

21:40.492 --> 21:42.494
You'll be doing
a lot of this, all right?

21:42.527 --> 21:45.865
Let's get it on! Yeah!

21:47.033 --> 21:48.968
Let's get fucked up
tonight, baby!

22:42.722 --> 22:44.790
It's not about you
tonight, Barb.

22:46.258 --> 22:47.660
But it could be.

22:48.928 --> 22:49.929
Stop.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.877
Hey, get the fuck out of here,
I got to piss.

23:04.910 --> 23:07.813
Steven, I need my phone.
I need to call an Uber and get him home.

23:07.847 --> 23:12.184
Get him the fuck out of here or I'm going
to piss in your fucking face again, bitch.

23:12.218 --> 23:14.653
- Jimmy, come on.
- You got to go.

23:14.687 --> 23:15.688
Sorry.

23:26.932 --> 23:29.201
Come on.
I'm sorry.

23:29.235 --> 23:31.603
Yeah, could you just hold him
real quick.

23:31.637 --> 23:33.339
Yeah.
What the hell did he drink?

23:33.372 --> 23:35.641
Jessie, get the fuck off him.
He's fine.

23:35.674 --> 23:37.810
- He's really sick.
- He's fine, Jessie.

23:37.843 --> 23:38.744
Get the fuck out here.

23:38.778 --> 23:40.646
No, he's not.
He's really sick.

23:40.679 --> 23:42.281
Get to my fucking room right
now, or I'm gonna send you home.

23:43.649 --> 23:44.650
Get up.

23:45.351 --> 23:46.519
- Steven.
- Get up.

23:46.551 --> 23:49.321
You got to give me
my phone, man. He's not okay.

23:49.355 --> 23:50.823
- Hmm?
- My cell phone.

23:50.856 --> 23:52.291
- Can you give me my cell phone.
- Your what?

23:52.324 --> 23:54.260
I need to call help, Steven. Help.

23:54.293 --> 23:55.694
I need my phone, man.

23:55.728 --> 23:57.863
Okay. All right.
Don't worry about it.

23:57.897 --> 24:00.598
Hey, someone get this kid
the fuck out of here.

24:00.633 --> 24:02.735
Not funny.
Ha-ha. Not funny.

24:02.768 --> 24:03.836
Bye-bye, Vergil.

24:06.138 --> 24:07.907
- There you go, buddy.
- That's done.

24:07.940 --> 24:10.009
Want something to drink, kid?
There you go.

24:11.710 --> 24:13.079
Jimmy, fucking relax.

24:14.947 --> 24:21.987
Pi Si Xi! Pi Si Xi! Pi Si Xi!

24:57.456 --> 24:59.125
Jimmy.
Come on.

24:59.892 --> 25:00.793
Jimmy.

25:00.826 --> 25:02.995
Where is Steven?
Where's... Where's Steven?

25:03.028 --> 25:05.865
Can you say that one more time?
Without being a pussy.

25:07.032 --> 25:09.101
Where is Steven?

25:09.135 --> 25:10.870
- He's up there.
- I need my phone. Where is Steven?

25:10.903 --> 25:12.271
He fucking has all the phones.

25:15.441 --> 25:16.709
I need my phone.

25:18.444 --> 25:19.845
No, Steven,
I need my phone.

25:19.879 --> 25:21.080
- Jimmy's not okay.
- Get the fuck out.

25:23.816 --> 25:25.684
You ever come into
my fucking room again,

25:26.886 --> 25:28.921
I'll toss your ass
down the steps. Okay?

25:30.990 --> 25:32.191
Phones.

25:32.224 --> 25:35.294
The party's over.
Take your fucking phones.

25:35.327 --> 25:37.329
Little brothers,
take your phones and shit.

25:37.363 --> 25:39.398
- Let's go, guys.
- There you go, Jimmy.

25:41.133 --> 25:42.935
Take your fucking phones.

25:44.870 --> 25:46.172
Phones over here.

25:46.205 --> 25:47.773
Fucking over.

25:48.407 --> 25:50.309
Bye, dudes.

25:50.342 --> 25:53.045
Bye, dudes.
Another successful night.

25:56.949 --> 25:59.351
You're fine, Jimmy.

25:59.385 --> 26:01.720
- Time to go, buddy.
- Yeah, I'm checking on him now.

26:01.754 --> 26:03.789
- Time to go.
- I'm gonna bring him some water

26:03.822 --> 26:05.357
He's non-responsive.
He's not okay.

26:05.391 --> 26:08.394
Who the fuck are you talking to?
He's fine. Everybody go.

26:08.427 --> 26:09.828
You should
call an ambulance.

26:09.862 --> 26:13.065
- He's just fucking drunk.
- Shit, I don't think he's doing too good.

26:13.098 --> 26:14.300
Shut the fuck up, Vinny!

26:14.333 --> 26:16.936
- Call the fucking ambulance.
- Shut the fuck up, he's fine!

26:16.969 --> 26:18.137
Fucking pussy!

26:18.170 --> 26:21.507
- You fucker!
- Call the fucking ambulance.

26:21.540 --> 26:24.076
You're the fucking president
of this fraternity, man.

26:24.109 --> 26:26.045
Go fuck off.
Shut the fuck up. He's fine.

26:26.078 --> 26:28.847
- Fucking call an ambulance right now.
- Everybody's fine.

26:28.881 --> 26:30.416
Get the fuck out!

26:30.449 --> 26:31.850
Shut the fuck up!

26:31.884 --> 26:33.919
This is my fucking frat.
Fuck all you guys.

26:33.953 --> 26:34.954
This is my fucking house.

26:34.987 --> 26:37.189
- He might need help.
- Get the fuck out!

26:39.191 --> 26:40.292
Jimmy, can you hear me?

26:40.326 --> 26:42.962
He's not responding, guys.
Let's get him out of here.

27:00.079 --> 27:01.313
Stay with us, Jimmy.

27:03.148 --> 27:04.350
Jimmy, can you hear me now?

27:08.587 --> 27:10.256
Hello.

27:10.289 --> 27:11.824
Is this Jimmy O'Brien's mother?

28:27.634 --> 28:31.337
As you can see, it is a very
somber night at the university,

28:31.370 --> 28:34.641
as freshman Jimmy O'Brien
remains in a coma.

28:34.674 --> 28:35.874
The freshman
from upstate New York

28:35.908 --> 28:39.311
reportedly had a lethal dosage
of alcohol mixed with Xanax.

28:39.345 --> 28:42.581
We're here tonight to
say a prayer for Jimmy O'Brien,

28:42.614 --> 28:47.586
a freshman at our New York
State University.

28:47.619 --> 28:54.059
As your President, I would like to express
my support to our whole student body

28:55.160 --> 28:57.129
and to the O'Brien family.

28:58.364 --> 29:02.368
And now,
could we all bow our heads...

29:02.401 --> 29:05.170
Through this holy anointing,

29:05.204 --> 29:07.606
may the Lord,
in his love and wisdom,

29:07.640 --> 29:10.175
help you with the grace
of the Holy Spirit.

29:11.543 --> 29:13.379
May the Lord
who frees you from sin

29:16.949 --> 29:19.318
save you and raise you up.

29:21.620 --> 29:23.322
My brothers and sisters,
let us pray.

29:23.989 --> 29:25.891
In the words our savior gave us.

29:27.393 --> 29:28.594
Our Father...

29:28.628 --> 29:29.895
Who art in heaven,

29:30.496 --> 29:32.632
Hallowed be thy Name,

29:32.665 --> 29:36.235
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

29:36.268 --> 29:38.671
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

29:38.705 --> 29:41.540
Give us this day our daily bread

29:41.573 --> 29:43.942
and forgive us our trespasses,

29:43.976 --> 29:47.212
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

29:47.946 --> 29:50.149
And lead us not into temptation,

29:51.083 --> 29:52.685
but deliver us from evil.

29:52.719 --> 29:54.353
Amen.

29:54.386 --> 29:55.554
May almighty God bless you.

29:55.587 --> 29:59.491
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

30:01.026 --> 30:02.027
Amen.

30:12.237 --> 30:13.238
Ready?

30:14.473 --> 30:16.008
Yeah.

31:57.376 --> 32:02.749
And forever as he brings
the same great joy to those in Heaven

32:02.782 --> 32:06.418
as he did to those who he
so loved here on Earth.

32:07.586 --> 32:11.089
May God bless
and keep Jimmy,

32:11.123 --> 32:15.662
and may we all keep the
O'Brien family in our hearts...

33:37.609 --> 33:39.611
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey.

33:44.249 --> 33:45.250
What's that?

33:46.284 --> 33:47.285
It's dinner.

33:48.587 --> 33:50.422
We gotta make sure
we thank the neighbors.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.193
What's that?

33:57.930 --> 34:00.599
It's a letter from
New York State University.

34:00.633 --> 34:02.434
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien,

34:04.336 --> 34:07.239
"It is the sad duty
of this office to inform you

34:07.272 --> 34:10.777
"that after a extensive State
Police Department investigation

34:10.810 --> 34:13.679
"into the tragic death
of your son Jim, Jr.,

34:14.647 --> 34:17.482
"and through a review
by outside council,

34:17.516 --> 34:23.554
"all parties have concluded and found the
University not liable for Jim's death.

34:25.623 --> 34:28.995
"We continue
to be at your service,

34:29.027 --> 34:32.496
"but will consider this matter closed.
"President Timmons."

34:43.909 --> 34:45.243
So, no one's liable?

34:46.445 --> 34:47.446
That's right.

34:50.016 --> 34:53.618
I spoke to
the President of Pi Xi today.

34:56.755 --> 34:58.423
And he...

34:58.457 --> 35:01.761
They ruled just
like the paper that...

35:01.794 --> 35:05.530
Jim was the one that should've been
responsible for what he drank that night.

35:05.564 --> 35:06.565
That's bullshit.

35:08.433 --> 35:09.601
That's bullshit.

35:12.337 --> 35:13.605
What about the Xanax?

35:15.407 --> 35:16.508
We got to move on.

35:28.721 --> 35:31.623
Shit! Mom,
we're out of everything!

35:31.657 --> 35:32.859
Can I have money
for lunch?

35:35.560 --> 35:36.561
We're gonna be late.

35:37.663 --> 35:38.865
Come on, come on,
come on.

35:38.898 --> 35:41.868
I love you. If you need
anything, just text me, okay?

35:45.004 --> 35:46.005
Bye, Mom.

37:09.722 --> 37:12.091
Barb, maybe you should...

37:14.492 --> 37:18.664
think about getting
a part-time job.

37:18.698 --> 37:20.432
Volunteer or something.

37:24.971 --> 37:26.038
You think?

38:42.882 --> 38:44.784
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

38:44.817 --> 38:48.020
Blessed art thou amongst women,
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

38:48.054 --> 38:50.156
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

38:50.189 --> 38:52.892
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen. You have to help me.

38:55.761 --> 38:58.030
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

38:58.064 --> 39:03.501
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

39:03.535 --> 39:06.639
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

39:06.672 --> 39:10.142
pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

39:10.176 --> 39:11.177
Hail Mary...

39:16.115 --> 39:18.017
blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

39:18.050 --> 39:19.852
Oh, shit.

39:22.788 --> 39:24.589
Guys, rise and shine.

39:24.622 --> 39:25.623
Rise and shine.

39:26.591 --> 39:28.794
Hail Mary, full of grace...

39:28.828 --> 39:30.062
Pancakes were excellent.

39:30.096 --> 39:32.530
Oh, good.
I'm so glad, Jim.

39:32.564 --> 39:34.566
Hey, Mom.
Are you okay now?

39:36.168 --> 39:38.170
I better be, right?

39:38.204 --> 39:41.539
I mean, how much longer can I sit around
feeling sorry for myself and smoking?

39:42.507 --> 39:45.845
Seriously, Jimmy would
kill you for smoking.

39:45.878 --> 39:48.681
Yeah, 'cause all he ever
did was mock you for quitting

39:48.714 --> 39:50.282
'cause you made
that bet with Dad

39:50.316 --> 39:52.918
that if you ever
got a redhead you'd quit.

39:52.952 --> 39:54.653
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

39:54.687 --> 39:56.722
'Cause you admitted to it
last New Year's Eve

39:56.756 --> 39:58.891
when you drank
too much wine with Grandma.

39:58.924 --> 40:01.160
Okay, Sean.

40:01.193 --> 40:02.995
Everyone knows I drank too much wine with Grandma
last year on New Year's Eve, it was stupid,

40:03.029 --> 40:05.131
but let me tell you
something else that's stupid.

40:06.065 --> 40:09.902
I've been just
sitting around... wallowing,

40:10.803 --> 40:12.071
and I can't do that anymore.

40:15.341 --> 40:18.044
I got to go away and do something
important for your brother.

40:22.214 --> 40:24.717
What? You're leaving?

40:24.750 --> 40:26.252
Barbara,
what's wrong with you?

40:26.285 --> 40:29.055
- What?
- What? Why don't you use the luggage?

40:29.088 --> 40:31.824
Because
our suitcases are moldy.

40:36.062 --> 40:38.330
Hey, Mom,
text me when you're there.

40:38.364 --> 40:40.366
I will. Love you.

40:40.399 --> 40:41.667
- Be good.
- Love you.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.003
My pants!
Fricking lost weight.

40:49.875 --> 40:50.876
You okay, Dad?

40:52.678 --> 40:55.081
Yeah, I'm just thinking
about an old friend.

41:03.389 --> 41:04.957
All right,
let's get ready for school.

41:04.990 --> 41:07.592
Girls, check your skirts.

41:26.412 --> 41:29.248
Yeah, hi.
Senator Daly's office.

41:34.353 --> 41:38.924
I'd like to leave a personal
message for Senator Daly.

41:46.799 --> 41:49.869
I'm an old fraternity brother,
and I'm just reaching out to say hello.

42:16.362 --> 42:18.030
Jim. Hi.

42:19.465 --> 42:21.467
No, honestly, Jim, I feel good.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.469
For the first time in weeks.

42:23.502 --> 42:27.406
So I called, uh,
one of my buddies from the fraternity,

42:28.841 --> 42:32.411
and, uh... he said
he could help us out.

42:34.246 --> 42:35.247
Yeah.

42:36.015 --> 42:37.783
Hey, kids, I'm here!

42:37.816 --> 42:40.419
Hang on a second.
I got to figure out where I'm going.

42:40.452 --> 42:42.955
Let me look at my directions.
I'll call you right back.

42:45.958 --> 42:47.059
Yikes.

42:47.092 --> 42:49.195
Okay. Asshole.

42:50.396 --> 42:51.397
Freak!

42:54.233 --> 42:58.237
Directions to Cleveland, Ohio.

42:58.270 --> 43:00.773
<i>Getting
directions to Cleveland, Ohio.</i>

43:12.918 --> 43:15.087
<i>Thank you for
calling Good Morning Cleveland.</i>

43:15.120 --> 43:17.022
<i>How may I help you?</i>

43:17.056 --> 43:19.191
<i>Hi.
My name's Barbara O'Brien,</i>

43:19.225 --> 43:22.261
<i>and I have an idea
for a story...</i>

43:22.294 --> 43:24.096
<i>Oh, I'm so sorry.</i>

43:24.129 --> 43:28.200
<i>We're six weeks out
on news stories.</i>

43:50.289 --> 43:51.290
Shit.

43:52.091 --> 43:53.092
Shit...

44:15.914 --> 44:17.383
Hi.

44:17.416 --> 44:18.951
My name's Barbara O'Brien,

44:18.984 --> 44:22.021
and I wanted to talk to you
about your son.

44:22.054 --> 44:23.322
We don't talk to the press.

44:26.091 --> 44:27.226
I'm not the press.

44:30.963 --> 44:32.164
I lost my son, too.

44:34.266 --> 44:36.135
I lost my son like you did.

44:36.168 --> 44:39.571
I have... I have
the article about your son.

44:39.605 --> 44:43.075
I read about him and I read about a
lot of other mothers just like us.

44:43.108 --> 44:44.143
And I have...

44:48.981 --> 44:49.982
Sorry.

44:51.083 --> 44:52.084
You want lemonade?

44:54.253 --> 44:56.221
That'd be great. I... I just...

44:56.255 --> 44:58.257
drove all the way
from upstate New York and...

45:01.661 --> 45:02.995
Really appreciate that.

45:04.063 --> 45:05.064
But, um...

45:10.035 --> 45:11.036
Thank you.

45:19.011 --> 45:24.450
My husband has a friend who works
in Washington D.C. as a senator.

45:24.483 --> 45:27.654
If you just let me record you, I just wanted
to get stories from all these mothers.

45:27.687 --> 45:29.588
I mean, I have
other boys, too.

45:30.923 --> 45:34.493
I spoke with the university,
and they say it was my son's fault.

45:37.396 --> 45:38.665
They told us that too,

45:38.698 --> 45:40.532
and that is bullshit
and you know it.

45:41.934 --> 45:43.535
- They tell you that, too?
- Yes.

45:45.137 --> 45:47.473
If you'll just
let me record you...

45:47.506 --> 45:49.642
Just tell the story
of your son.

45:49.676 --> 45:53.011
Then I can help your boy
and my boy,

45:53.045 --> 45:55.381
and the memory...

45:57.149 --> 45:58.283
You have to go.

46:03.589 --> 46:04.990
I will do it.

46:05.023 --> 46:07.593
Okay. Just talk about your son.

46:11.597 --> 46:12.598
Okay.

46:14.299 --> 46:17.035
My son, Carlos...

46:19.171 --> 46:22.174
died in a frat hazing incident.

46:24.476 --> 46:28.648
<i>They say that it was his fault
in the university.</i>

46:28.681 --> 46:31.517
<i>But his body was all cut up.</i>

46:50.502 --> 46:54.440
Directions to
Fort Wayne, Indiana.

46:54.473 --> 46:57.109
<i>Getting
directions to Fort Wayne, Indiana.</i>

46:57.142 --> 47:00.245
<i>Baltimore
AM, May I help you?</i>

47:00.279 --> 47:02.514
<i>Hi.
My name's Barbara O'Brien.</i>

47:02.548 --> 47:06.084
And I have an idea
for a story idea

47:06.118 --> 47:08.587
that you guys could maybe do
about a boy

47:08.620 --> 47:12.524
that was killed in a, um,
frat hazing incident.

47:13.793 --> 47:17.362
And he was, uh,
actually my son.

47:17.396 --> 47:19.331
<i>We're five weeks out
on stories.</i>

47:19.799 --> 47:21.066
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

47:22.067 --> 47:23.168
Shit!

47:24.036 --> 47:25.103
Stupid asses.

47:39.752 --> 47:43.322
<i>Hey, Barbara, call me
when you can. Sean's having a hard time.</i>

47:48.695 --> 47:50.395
Jim.

47:50.429 --> 47:53.098
<i>Hello. I'm trying to reach Barbara
O'Brien. This is Senator Bob Daly.</i>

47:53.131 --> 47:55.234
What? Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

47:56.301 --> 47:58.036
Senator. I'm... I'm so sorry.

47:58.070 --> 48:01.674
<i>Well, I appreciate you calling me.
Thank you so much.</i>

48:01.708 --> 48:06.311
Oh, that's okay. Listen, uh,
I don't know if you knew or not,

48:06.345 --> 48:09.615
but your husband and I were
fraternity members at Westerly,

48:09.649 --> 48:14.152
and, uh, well, I just wanted
to offer my condolences

48:14.186 --> 48:17.489
on the passing of your...
your son, Jimmy.

48:17.523 --> 48:19.358
I know it must've been
very difficult for you.

48:19.391 --> 48:22.829
Your husband, Jim and I, we were...
we were on crew together,

48:22.862 --> 48:26.598
and, well, if there's ever anything
I can do, you just let me know.

48:26.633 --> 48:27.734
<i>Yes, well, um...</i>

48:28.868 --> 48:29.836
<i>Hang on, I'm driving.</i>

48:29.869 --> 48:34.172
Um, we... are just trying
to make a change.

48:34.206 --> 48:37.109
And it's just crazy what's going on
with these fraternities, as you know,

48:37.142 --> 48:41.547
and, I mean,
how many kids have to die

48:41.580 --> 48:44.349
before someone's liable, right?

48:44.383 --> 48:47.119
Well, like I said, uh,

48:47.152 --> 48:50.222
you know, if there's ever anything
I can do, you just let me know.

48:50.255 --> 48:54.661
Uh, your husband
was a frat brother and...

48:54.694 --> 48:56.796
Well, once a brother,
always a brother, hmm?

48:56.829 --> 48:58.363
You know what, Senator?

48:58.397 --> 49:00.667
We need someone in the
government to help us

49:00.700 --> 49:04.136
<i>pass laws to change everything.</i>

49:04.169 --> 49:08.140
I have all these videos that are
just unbelievable of these moms.

49:08.173 --> 49:10.677
And the different stories,
it just makes you sick...

49:10.710 --> 49:12.578
<i>I understand,
this must be hard.</i>

49:12.611 --> 49:13.780
All right.
Well, you know what?

49:13.813 --> 49:16.515
Senator, I'm really gonna
take you up on that. I mean it.

49:16.548 --> 49:18.851
My pleasure.
Nice talking to you, Barbara.

49:18.885 --> 49:23.288
<i>'We need adult supervision 24/7 in the fraternities...</i>

49:23.322 --> 49:25.457

- <i>What do you wanna say?</i>

49:35.668 --> 49:38.337
- Hi. I'm Barbara.
- Hi, Barbara. I'm Stephanie.

49:38.370 --> 49:41.540
- Won't you come in?
- Okay, thanks.

49:41.573 --> 49:45.544
- I want to tell you first how sorry I am about your son.
- Thank you.

49:45.577 --> 49:49.314
Okay. So I should be there probably,
I don't know, in about an hour. Hello.

49:49.348 --> 49:52.250
- How're you doing, ma'am?
- Good. Thank you so much.

49:52.284 --> 49:56.488
- Well, thank you.
- How far am I to Wheeling, West Virginia?

49:56.521 --> 49:58.557
Wheeling, West Virginia... Oh.

50:12.905 --> 50:14.674
Text Dad.

50:14.707 --> 50:16.441
<i>What do you wanna say?</i>

50:18.711 --> 50:22.682
<i>Jim, it's me. Call me back when
you get this. You're probably at lunch.</i>

50:22.715 --> 50:26.618
<i>I want to make sure the Senator
is getting my message</i>

50:26.653 --> 50:31.858
that I'm gonna be there
in three days, after Pittsburgh.

50:31.891 --> 50:35.560
And let me know where I should stay
outside of D.C. so it's not too expensive.

50:35.594 --> 50:36.663
Can you book it for me?

50:38.363 --> 50:40.700
<i>Here's your message.
Ready to send it?</i>

50:47.506 --> 50:52.377
On the night that he passed, the mortician
said that he choked on his own vomit.

50:54.446 --> 50:56.515
And that's what
still bothers me.

50:56.548 --> 51:01.420
'Cause when he was a little boy,
he was always bigger than the other kids,

51:01.453 --> 51:06.258
but he was always afraid
of throwing up.

51:06.291 --> 51:11.496
And the university investigator said
that he... drank too much on his own.

51:13.800 --> 51:16.368
But there was this one
frat brother that he knew.

51:16.401 --> 51:19.538
He was another good
ballplayer who used to verse

51:19.571 --> 51:24.509
and, uh, he was pledging too,
and he came to the house...

51:27.379 --> 51:29.548
on his own to...

51:31.283 --> 51:33.019
After Greg passed,
and he told me

51:33.052 --> 51:36.421
that the head pledge leader
of the fraternity

51:36.455 --> 51:39.624
was making Greg do
shot after shot,

51:39.659 --> 51:40.927
and I asked why,

51:41.961 --> 51:46.666
and he said that the leader said

51:46.699 --> 51:50.970
that a farm boy should be able
to handle liquor like a man.

51:52.939 --> 51:54.272
"A man," Barb?

51:59.377 --> 52:03.649
My boy just turned 18.
I don't care how big he was.

52:04.449 --> 52:05.752
He was just a kid.

52:07.452 --> 52:08.487
I'm sorry.

52:11.924 --> 52:13.291
Sorry.

52:13.325 --> 52:14.593

Oh, my goodness,
she's very early.

53:33.572 --> 53:35.708
- Oh.
- Hi, Mrs. Donohue.

53:35.741 --> 53:37.777
- I'm Barbara O'Brien.
- I'm Mary.

53:37.810 --> 53:41.479
Hi, Mary. I love your house.
It's so nice.

53:43.182 --> 53:45.818
I mean, my God.

53:45.852 --> 53:50.455
I am so sorry to say that I have a meeting
this afternoon that I can't get out of.

53:50.488 --> 53:51.824
Oh, my God, you do?

53:51.858 --> 53:53.726
I wouldn't have come today
if you have a meeting.

53:53.759 --> 53:56.162
- Is this an inconvenience?
- Thank you.

53:56.195 --> 53:57.697
We'll have an early dinner.

53:57.730 --> 53:59.966
My husband has a flight
first thing in the morning.

53:59.999 --> 54:01.901
Okay. So what time
do you wanna have dinner?

54:01.934 --> 54:04.502
- 6:30 in the dining room.
- Oh.

54:04.536 --> 54:08.741
Julia. James, you please
help her with her luggage.

54:08.774 --> 54:10.843
It's actually
in the back of my car.

54:22.454 --> 54:24.857
If there's anything
else you need just let me know.

54:24.891 --> 54:27.093
Thank you... James.

54:27.126 --> 54:28.127
Thank you, James.

55:27.119 --> 55:29.155
Uh. Oh, F.

55:31.724 --> 55:32.959
Shit!

55:32.992 --> 55:33.993
Shitty shit shit!

55:36.729 --> 55:38.664
I'm so sorry.

55:38.698 --> 55:39.999
I don't know what happened.

55:40.032 --> 55:43.102
I thought dinner
was at 6:30.

55:43.135 --> 55:45.771
Oh, Mary should've said 6:00.
I have an early morning.

55:45.805 --> 55:47.572
It was a miscommunication.

55:47.605 --> 55:49.574
No, actually, I think
it was definitely my fault.

55:49.607 --> 55:53.112
I took a bath in your bathtub
and I got so relaxed

55:53.145 --> 55:56.148
that I literally passed out on
the bed and woke up to my alarm

55:56.182 --> 55:59.785
- I apologize.
- She should've consulted my calendar. Wine?

56:03.255 --> 56:05.725
I looked at the wrong calendar.

56:07.126 --> 56:09.128
I... I'm sorry.

56:09.161 --> 56:11.998
Don't call me "she," Tom,
I'm sitting right here.

56:12.031 --> 56:13.666
Is this a bad time?

56:13.699 --> 56:14.934
Mary doesn't like details.

56:14.967 --> 56:16.202
Would you like some wine?

56:16.235 --> 56:18.704
Oh, yes,
I'd love wine.

56:18.738 --> 56:23.943
I'm 100% Irish, so I'm like a horse
at a race track that's a thoroughbred.

56:23.976 --> 56:25.610
That's what my husband
always says.

56:25.644 --> 56:26.679
Oh, my God.

56:28.214 --> 56:32.251
This looks unbelievable.
I haven't had a real meal since...

56:32.284 --> 56:33.786
Well, I don't know,
since I left home.

56:33.819 --> 56:37.189
But, anyway,
here is to our boys...

56:39.191 --> 56:43.629
and I just wanted you to know
that we're not alone.

56:43.662 --> 56:46.598
There's a lot of other families
that are just like us.

56:46.632 --> 56:48.167
And I'm gonna go to Washington

56:48.200 --> 56:52.570
and I'm gonna do this for our
boys, and get the law changed.

56:52.604 --> 56:54.940
And I'll never forget
that you had me into your home.

56:55.708 --> 56:57.009
Thanks so much.

56:57.043 --> 56:59.311
I have videos
from all these moms.

56:59.345 --> 57:01.546
- And...
- Videos? What kind of videos?

57:03.082 --> 57:04.083
They're...

57:04.750 --> 57:06.618
Oh. Cheers.

57:06.652 --> 57:08.687
They're video...
Oh, cheers. Thank you.

57:08.721 --> 57:12.058
They're videos of other,
um, families, mainly moms,

57:13.625 --> 57:16.829
talking about
exactly what happened.

57:16.862 --> 57:20.900
That hazing is a criminal act
and insane.

57:20.933 --> 57:23.169
Well, it's tradition.

57:23.202 --> 57:29.607
Well, yeah, but in the old days, there used
to be adult presence in the fraternities.

57:29.642 --> 57:32.244
- Like, when my husband...
- If a child goes to the military, there's...

57:32.278 --> 57:35.648
- Adult present at frat...
- There's adult supervision in the army.

57:35.681 --> 57:37.383
Look, what fraternity
have you been at?

57:45.024 --> 57:46.158
Thanks, Pete.

58:06.178 --> 58:09.849
My grandmother liked Baileys Irish
Cream so much we named our dog Baileys.

58:12.151 --> 58:13.419
That's a great story.

58:13.452 --> 58:14.687
Thank you.

58:14.720 --> 58:16.422
It sounds like
a fond memory, too.

58:16.455 --> 58:20.059
I have an early flight,
so I'm going to excuse myself.

58:20.092 --> 58:21.660
Oh, my God,
you have to go.

58:21.694 --> 58:22.795
I, uh... I do.

58:22.828 --> 58:24.663
I'm gonna give you
a big fat hug.

58:24.697 --> 58:26.132
Oh, that's all right.
No, that's okay.

58:26.165 --> 58:28.000
- I want thank you so much for coming.
- Okay.

58:28.033 --> 58:30.069
I mean,
for me coming here.

58:30.102 --> 58:31.937
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

58:31.971 --> 58:34.039
- Thank you for having me.
- I'll see you upstairs.

58:36.075 --> 58:39.778
Do you wanna tell your story?
I'll, uh, videotape.

58:41.213 --> 58:43.249
I'm really not very good
at that kind of thing.

58:46.418 --> 58:48.020
No one's really good
at that kind of thing,

58:48.053 --> 58:49.455
but you have to do it
for your boy

58:49.488 --> 58:53.425
because otherwise,
I have nothing to show

58:53.459 --> 58:57.396
the Senator
in Washington, D.C.

58:57.429 --> 59:00.432
You're gonna stand
right next to your boy,

59:00.466 --> 59:02.067
and I'm gonna videotape you.

59:03.102 --> 59:04.737
Back up there.

59:04.770 --> 59:06.138
You're just gonna...

59:07.473 --> 59:09.008
I'm getting really good at this.

59:09.875 --> 59:11.343
When you're ready, Mary...

59:13.012 --> 59:14.880
you're gonna tell me
all about your son.

59:17.850 --> 59:19.285
My son, Tommy...

59:22.488 --> 59:24.390
He was my only son.

59:26.325 --> 59:27.860
He was my only child.

59:29.795 --> 59:31.030
And his father...

59:36.168 --> 59:37.937
They were never very close.

59:40.306 --> 59:43.209
But then
Tommy went off to college,

59:43.242 --> 59:45.244
<i>and they found a connection.</i>

59:45.277 --> 59:49.114
<i>Because Tommy wanted to rush
his father's fraternity.</i>

59:53.085 --> 59:54.820
Call Dad.

59:54.853 --> 59:56.222
<i>Calling Dad.</i>

59:56.255 --> 59:57.957
Jim, it's me.
Oh, my God.

59:57.990 --> 59:59.992
<i>You cannot not believe
the Donohues' house.</i>

01:00:00.025 --> 01:00:01.460
<i>It was insane.
I got up early.</i>

01:00:01.493 --> 01:00:05.097
I could not even sleep. I was so excited.
I have so many great tapes.

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:07.166
The wife was unbelievable.

01:00:07.199 --> 01:00:10.135
And now I'm gonna head
to Senator Daly's early,

01:00:10.169 --> 01:00:12.771
'cause I just wanna go
and check it out.

01:00:12.805 --> 01:00:15.241
I googled his house
and you should see it.

01:00:15.274 --> 01:00:16.909
It's another splashy one.

01:00:16.942 --> 01:00:19.411
It's literally like I'm doing
a tour of the rich houses.

01:00:19.445 --> 01:00:20.779
It's insane!

01:00:20.813 --> 01:00:24.316
Anyway... Yeah,
one bagel and a coffee.

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:26.352
Thank you. Here you go.

01:00:26.385 --> 01:00:27.386
Here's a tip.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.355
Um, anyway...

01:00:30.956 --> 01:00:32.291
I'm going straight through.

01:00:32.324 --> 01:00:34.526
I'm not gonna bother, um,

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.796
going to wherever you told me to
go, Northern Virginia.

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:41.767
I'm just gonna go straight
through and check out his joint.

01:00:49.108 --> 01:00:50.209
Oh, my God.

01:01:00.119 --> 01:01:02.187
Hi, sheep.

01:01:03.856 --> 01:01:04.890
Ow!

01:01:06.091 --> 01:01:08.827
Ow! Ow!

01:01:08.861 --> 01:01:11.063
Hi. Thank you. Here's your ticket.
Have a nice night.

01:01:16.402 --> 01:01:17.403
Good afternoon.

01:01:19.138 --> 01:01:22.141
Hi. This is
Senator Daly's, right?

01:01:22.174 --> 01:01:26.412
That's correct. Are you here to,
um, to work the fundraising event?

01:01:26.445 --> 01:01:30.049
Yes. Um, wait. Actually, no.

01:01:30.082 --> 01:01:33.986
They gave me this shitty rental,
and I'm actually here for the fundraiser.

01:01:34.019 --> 01:01:35.454
Oh, you're attending
the fundraiser?

01:01:36.588 --> 01:01:38.457
Yes, I'm attending
the fundraiser.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:42.227
Actually, I need to get my, um,
my fundraiser dress,

01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:44.263
- because I go to a lot of fundraisers.
- Okay.

01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:48.233
This one will work.

01:01:48.267 --> 01:01:49.535
Uh, just gotta get my shoes.

01:01:53.439 --> 01:01:57.343
God, I hate to have to constantly go to fundraisers.

01:01:58.043 --> 01:02:00.647
Um, okay.
Thank you so much.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.114
Are the keys in the car?

01:02:02.147 --> 01:02:03.549
Um, yeah.

01:02:03.582 --> 01:02:06.452
- That's what we do, right?
- Great. Yes. Here's your parking ticket.

01:02:06.485 --> 01:02:08.253
- Thanks a million.
- Okay.

01:02:14.159 --> 01:02:16.028
- Hi.
- Welcome.

01:02:17.162 --> 01:02:18.163
Thank you.

01:02:43.122 --> 01:02:44.256
God, I look terrible!

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.928
Jim,
you cannot believe it!

01:02:49.962 --> 01:02:51.530
I'm at the Senator's house.

01:02:51.563 --> 01:02:55.100
It is enormous!
Splashy, splashy.

01:02:55.134 --> 01:02:57.269
Oh, yeah?

01:02:57.302 --> 01:02:59.037
I told you he was
a nice guy, right?

01:03:00.305 --> 01:03:01.306
He invited you.

01:03:04.276 --> 01:03:05.277
Who invited you?

01:03:07.479 --> 01:03:08.981
Oh, no!

01:03:09.014 --> 01:03:11.383
Barbara, you can't just
crash his party.

01:03:11.417 --> 01:03:13.218
Jim, stop talking.

01:03:13.252 --> 01:03:15.421
I have to go in.
I love you. Bye.

01:03:15.454 --> 01:03:17.189
Holy shit, he's right!

01:03:17.222 --> 01:03:19.291
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much for having us.

01:03:25.063 --> 01:03:26.733
Hi.
Doing a great job tonight.

01:03:26.766 --> 01:03:29.468
Senator, thank you
for taking our cheque.

01:03:30.737 --> 01:03:32.538
- Anytime.
- Elizabeth. Great to see you.

01:03:32.571 --> 01:03:34.674
Very well, thank you.
How about yourself?

01:03:34.707 --> 01:03:36.408
Pretty well.
You ready for a speech?

01:03:36.442 --> 01:03:38.243
I am.

01:03:44.784 --> 01:03:46.753
Ladies and gentlemen,
for those of you who don't know me,

01:03:46.786 --> 01:03:48.120
I'm Tom Donohue.

01:03:48.153 --> 01:03:50.522
And I would like
to take this opportunity

01:03:50.556 --> 01:03:54.493
to make a toast
to Senator Daly.

01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:56.696
Thank you. Cheers, everyone.
Thank you all for coming.

01:04:00.399 --> 01:04:02.267
Without Bob's support,
we at the frat pack

01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:05.504
would not be able
to stand as a brotherhood.

01:04:05.537 --> 01:04:07.740
Because, as many of you know,

01:04:07.774 --> 01:04:11.711
recently we've come under, uh,
a good amount of negative publicity

01:04:11.744 --> 01:04:15.715
that's been directed at
this great American institution.

01:04:15.748 --> 01:04:17.449
And why is that?

01:04:17.483 --> 01:04:19.284
Because of a few...

01:04:19.318 --> 01:04:21.386
just a few random incidents.

01:04:22.287 --> 01:04:25.023
A few random incidents.

01:04:25.057 --> 01:04:27.660
Despite my own son's
tragic death.

01:04:27.694 --> 01:04:32.699
On behalf of Tom, I would like to accept
his responsibility for his own death.

01:04:32.732 --> 01:04:34.333
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much.

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:40.372
Senat... Senator Daly.

01:04:41.273 --> 01:04:42.374
- Yes?
- Hi.

01:04:43.242 --> 01:04:45.544
I'm Jim O'Brien's wife.

01:04:46.245 --> 01:04:48.046
Yes, Mrs. O'Brien.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.048
I... I wasn't
expecting you until tomorrow.

01:04:50.082 --> 01:04:51.684
I don't normally do fundraisers.

01:04:51.718 --> 01:04:54.486
- I'm sorry, everyone.
- Yes. Everyone, this is Mrs. O'Brien.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.421
Her husband and I
were fraternity brothers.

01:04:56.455 --> 01:04:58.524
Unfortunately, my husband
couldn't be here tonight, though,

01:04:58.557 --> 01:05:00.158
because he's home
with my other kids.

01:05:00.192 --> 01:05:02.327
Yes, which is wonderful.
So why don't we...

01:05:02.361 --> 01:05:04.062
Actually... Excuse me!

01:05:05.698 --> 01:05:08.801
Not all of my children, though,
because my son Jimmy...

01:05:10.402 --> 01:05:11.503
is gone.

01:05:11.537 --> 01:05:14.473
- Like...
- Yes, yes. Very hard, Barbara.

01:05:14.506 --> 01:05:18.477
Like Mr. Donohue's, and he...

01:05:20.546 --> 01:05:23.482
experienced a random incident.

01:05:23.515 --> 01:05:25.551
But in his pledge... Excuse me.

01:05:25.584 --> 01:05:28.320
- Please. We have guests...
- Excuse me. In his pledge...

01:05:29.421 --> 01:05:31.223
he said that he believed...

01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:35.662
in the
importance of honor and virtue.

01:05:35.695 --> 01:05:38.163
Okay. All right. That's...
That's enough, Barbara.

01:05:38.196 --> 01:05:40.465
- Excuse me.
- Barbara, may I speak with you?

01:05:40.499 --> 01:05:42.835
And the Senator
was going to help me

01:05:42.869 --> 01:05:47.506
because I have a lot of videos of
other moms who lost their boys.

01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:52.645
And we were going to try
to change the legislation...

01:05:54.747 --> 01:05:57.316
to stop hazing. But...

01:05:57.349 --> 01:06:00.419
that doesn't seem like
it's going to happen now.

01:06:00.452 --> 01:06:01.486
Why not?

01:06:03.656 --> 01:06:04.791
Because...

01:06:07.492 --> 01:06:10.462
If you don't give a shit
about your son,

01:06:10.495 --> 01:06:12.531
how are you two gonna
give a shit about mine?

01:06:12.564 --> 01:06:14.767
All right, that's enough.
That is enough.

01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:15.802
Excuse me.

01:06:21.239 --> 01:06:23.810
Um, I'm terribly
sorry about that disturbance, everyone.

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:26.244
Please forgive it.

01:06:26.278 --> 01:06:27.680
Ma'am, everything okay?

01:06:27.714 --> 01:06:28.715
No!

01:06:30.315 --> 01:06:31.316
Shit!

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.489
Damn it!
Where are my keys?

01:06:37.522 --> 01:06:39.257
Give me your ticket,
ma'am. I'll get your...

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.193
I don't have the ticket.
Give me my keys.

01:06:41.226 --> 01:06:42.561
- I don't know which key's yours.
- I gave you...

01:06:42.594 --> 01:06:44.529
- I don't know which key's yours, ma'am.
- Shit!

01:06:45.297 --> 01:06:46.365
Which one...

01:06:47.299 --> 01:06:48.300
Stupid!

01:07:57.369 --> 01:07:59.772
Hey, Jim. I'm coming home.

01:08:01.373 --> 01:08:02.541
It's stupid. I'm done.

01:08:09.281 --> 01:08:10.449
Stupid thing.

01:08:10.482 --> 01:08:11.583
<i>It's Jimmy O'Brien.</i>

01:08:11.616 --> 01:08:13.186
<i>I can't get to
the phone right now</i>

01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:15.822
<i>but if you leave a voicemail,
I will get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:21.292
Hey, Jimmy. It's Mom.

01:08:22.527 --> 01:08:25.263
I... tried for you,
buddy, but...

01:08:25.898 --> 01:08:27.499
but it didn't work. So...

01:08:28.433 --> 01:08:30.469
<i>I'm heading home, okay, buddy?</i>

01:08:30.502 --> 01:08:33.537
<i>Keep left onto I-380 for...</i>

01:08:33.572 --> 01:08:34.674
Oh, shut up.

01:09:22.453 --> 01:09:24.456
Directions to Home.

01:09:24.488 --> 01:09:26.390
<i>Getting directions to Home.</i>

01:09:35.667 --> 01:09:36.769
Hi, Mom.

01:09:36.803 --> 01:09:37.870
<i>Hey, Kel.
Is Dad home?</i>

01:09:37.904 --> 01:09:40.006
<i>I keep trying to call him.
He's not answering.</i>

01:09:40.038 --> 01:09:42.008
No. He's so annoying.
He went to Val's again.

01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:44.010
Who'd he go to Val's with?

01:09:44.042 --> 01:09:46.779
I don't know.
You seriously have to come home.

01:09:46.813 --> 01:09:48.513
<i>I know. I'm coming home
tomorrow, Kelly.</i>

01:09:48.546 --> 01:09:50.015
<i>The Senator was a joke.</i>

01:09:50.049 --> 01:09:53.685
Anyway, listen, don't tell Sean and
Ciara that I'm coming home tomorrow

01:09:53.719 --> 01:09:57.489
- because I want to surprise them.
- Okay.

01:09:57.522 --> 01:09:59.725
- <i>I'm gonna try Dad again. Love you.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i> Bye.

01:10:05.298 --> 01:10:08.634
It's my wife. She's not gonna give up.

01:10:09.869 --> 01:10:11.369
Excuse me, Vergil.

01:10:13.572 --> 01:10:14.573
Yeah, honey.

01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:16.175
Jim.

01:10:16.209 --> 01:10:19.078
What... What's going on?
I called you, like, five times.

01:10:19.111 --> 01:10:20.579
They pissed on him.

01:10:22.114 --> 01:10:23.883
What are...
What are you saying?

01:10:23.916 --> 01:10:26.384
They tied him to a chair
'cause he passed out

01:10:26.418 --> 01:10:29.722
because of all the alcohol they
poured down his fucking throat,

01:10:29.755 --> 01:10:31.489
and then they peed on him.

01:10:31.523 --> 01:10:34.426
Jim, are you drunk?
What are you saying to me?

01:10:34.459 --> 01:10:37.663
<i>They pissed on our son.
I wanna kill this motherfucker.</i>

01:10:37.697 --> 01:10:39.632
Send her the fucking photos.

01:10:39.665 --> 01:10:41.600
- Send her the fucking photos!
- Okay.

01:11:08.694 --> 01:11:09.695
What the...

01:11:55.007 --> 01:11:56.474
Hey.

01:11:56.508 --> 01:11:58.644
Can I get these vodka...
Or whatever they are.

01:11:58.678 --> 01:12:00.478
Uh, shot glasses too.

01:12:01.647 --> 01:12:02.715
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:12:02.748 --> 01:12:03.883
You can keep the change.

01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:06.786
Have fun at the party.

01:12:06.819 --> 01:12:09.655
This here gun's
a very easy gun to operate.

01:12:09.689 --> 01:12:11.190
Very good gun for beginners.

01:12:11.223 --> 01:12:12.224
Okay, good.

01:12:12.892 --> 01:12:15.962
Um, and... what about bullets?

01:12:15.995 --> 01:12:17.562
Well, ma'am,
those are extra.

01:12:17.595 --> 01:12:21.968
But if you download our app, you get
10% off today and a coupon for a rifle.

01:12:22.001 --> 01:12:25.071
Okay. I'm not really
that technical.

01:12:25.104 --> 01:12:27.940
You don't have to be technical,
you just aim and pull the trigger.

01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:31.644
I was actually talking
about the app.

01:12:31.677 --> 01:12:34.747
That's easy. My wife walked me through it.
I can show you how.

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.215
That's... That's okay.

01:12:36.248 --> 01:12:39.584
Actually, I'm just gonna take this
gun and just two bullets, please.

01:12:39.617 --> 01:12:40.618
Well...

01:12:42.254 --> 01:12:45.825
there's 50 rounds to a box.

01:12:45.858 --> 01:12:48.526
Oh, my gosh. I don't think I'm
gonna need that many, I hope.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.229
Well, maybe you can recycle.

01:12:52.031 --> 01:12:53.866
- Do you recycle?
- No.

01:12:55.768 --> 01:12:56.769
Me neither.

01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:00.239
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna give you cash.

01:13:00.272 --> 01:13:02.241
My husband gave me
a ton of cash.

01:13:02.274 --> 01:13:05.211
Just confirming that my card
went through for the cottage?

01:13:06.879 --> 01:13:09.181
Yes, O'Brien. Yes.

01:13:09.215 --> 01:13:11.516
O-B-R-I-E-N. That's correct.

01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:15.221
Okay. And I just want
to ask one question.

01:13:15.254 --> 01:13:17.656
It says in the ad it's secluded.

01:13:18.758 --> 01:13:19.759
Okay, perfect.

01:13:41.847 --> 01:13:43.916
Give it to me.

01:13:47.787 --> 01:13:49.021
Prick.

01:13:49.055 --> 01:13:50.856
Nope. You can't sing.

01:13:53.926 --> 01:13:57.595
Life is good, dudes.
Life is good, good, good.

01:14:00.066 --> 01:14:01.167
Oh, my ass.

01:14:05.104 --> 01:14:06.205
Hello.

01:14:06.238 --> 01:14:07.940
Hello, Steven?

01:14:07.973 --> 01:14:11.010
This is, um, Barbara O'Brien.
Jimmy's mom.

01:14:12.044 --> 01:14:13.079
Oh, shit.

01:14:13.112 --> 01:14:15.047
Oh. Hi, Mrs. O'Brien.

01:14:15.981 --> 01:14:16.982
What's going on?

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.120
My husband and I
are heading out there today

01:14:21.921 --> 01:14:24.056
for, um, the day

01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:28.360
'cause we wanted to give you guys a
cheque for the fraternity in Jimmy's name.

01:14:29.995 --> 01:14:32.031
Wow! That...

01:14:32.064 --> 01:14:33.666
That's... You don't
have to do that.

01:14:33.699 --> 01:14:36.235
That's... I mean...

01:14:36.268 --> 01:14:38.904
No, actually, we really
wanna do that because,

01:14:38.938 --> 01:14:43.843
um, you guys did
so much for him, and...

01:14:43.876 --> 01:14:47.279
that's what my husband
really wants to do.

01:14:48.247 --> 01:14:49.682
Right, Jim?

01:14:49.715 --> 01:14:52.418
It's O'Brien's mom. She's coming here.
She wants to give us a cheque.

01:14:52.451 --> 01:14:55.221
Um, that would be wonderful.

01:14:55.254 --> 01:14:57.356
I mean, we would...
We can always use the money.

01:14:57.389 --> 01:15:01.060
The frat, uh, would be
super-appreciative of that.

01:15:01.093 --> 01:15:03.095
Thank you so much, Mrs. O'Brien.

01:15:03.129 --> 01:15:04.797
Okay, thank you.

01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:07.733
We'll be out there in, um,
probably a couple hours.

01:15:08.934 --> 01:15:11.170
Okay. Thanks so much.

01:15:18.744 --> 01:15:21.013
- Well, I'm fucking confused.
- And I'm fucking hungry.

01:15:21.046 --> 01:15:22.982
- What do you guys want? Pizza?
- Uh, yeah.

01:15:23.015 --> 01:15:24.416
Order... Give me this.

01:15:26.085 --> 01:15:27.153
Pepperoni?

01:15:27.186 --> 01:15:29.421
- Oh, no. Shit.
- Incoming.

01:16:28.447 --> 01:16:31.717
This pizza's
cold and burned.

01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:40.960
Jesus Christ!

01:17:28.841 --> 01:17:30.876
Who keeps calling you?

01:17:30.909 --> 01:17:32.478
Nobody.

01:17:36.448 --> 01:17:38.384
Don't do me any favors, asshole.

01:17:49.094 --> 01:17:50.562
What the fuck is that?

01:17:50.596 --> 01:17:52.264
- Hey!
- Oh, shit.

01:17:53.599 --> 01:17:54.900
Hey!

01:17:54.933 --> 01:17:57.836
You want me to come
down here or should I come there?

01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:00.539
- No. We'll come down there.
- Okay.

01:18:02.574 --> 01:18:05.077
Uh, Vinny, go get the cheque.

01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:06.612
I'm not going over there.

01:18:06.646 --> 01:18:09.481
Go get the cheque, man.
She's offering us money, so go get it.

01:18:09.515 --> 01:18:11.183
Steve, you're the president.

01:18:11.216 --> 01:18:12.951
Wait. She's giving you money?

01:18:12.985 --> 01:18:14.520
- Yeah. She's giving...
- Steven, go.

01:18:16.221 --> 01:18:18.157
Seriously. Go.

01:18:19.224 --> 01:18:21.060
Fucking pain in my ass.

01:18:35.974 --> 01:18:38.410
Come in. You don't want to catch cold.

01:18:38.444 --> 01:18:40.546
- Come on in.
- All right.

01:18:40.579 --> 01:18:43.182
All right.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.521
How are ya?

01:18:51.423 --> 01:18:53.058
It's been hard.

01:18:56.395 --> 01:18:58.464
Still able to have parties,
though, right?

01:19:00.633 --> 01:19:03.569
Oh, we're just, you know,
we're just hanging out. Just...

01:19:03.602 --> 01:19:05.471
- That's fun.
- Yeah.

01:19:06.338 --> 01:19:07.406
That's really fun.

01:19:08.708 --> 01:19:12.144
- So...
- I wanna give you this cheque, though.

01:19:12.177 --> 01:19:15.914
Because Jimmy, I know,
would want you to have it.

01:19:17.383 --> 01:19:19.151
I mean, you meant
the world to him.

01:19:19.184 --> 01:19:22.020
- I mean, you really don't have to that. It's fine.
- I want to.

01:19:22.054 --> 01:19:23.055
I want to.

01:19:24.423 --> 01:19:26.392
But you know what I did?
Damn it.

01:19:31.363 --> 01:19:33.999
I left my pen and everything in the back seat.

01:19:34.701 --> 01:19:36.168
- Okay.
- I'm an idiot.

01:19:36.201 --> 01:19:37.202
Oh, no.

01:19:39.739 --> 01:19:40.939
Fuck.

01:19:45.277 --> 01:19:48.313
Okay. So, let's see.

01:19:49.615 --> 01:19:52.418
Oh, damn it!

01:19:52.451 --> 01:19:55.220
Do you have, um...
a light on your phone?

01:19:55.254 --> 01:19:56.689
- 'Cause my phone is, like...
- Yeah.

01:19:56.723 --> 01:19:58.323
a hundred years old
and I can't work it.

01:19:58.357 --> 01:19:59.558
- I do.
- It's dead.

01:19:59.591 --> 01:20:00.626
Here you go.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:02.294
- Okay.
- Is it...

01:20:02.327 --> 01:20:03.195
Oh, thank you so much.

01:20:03.228 --> 01:20:05.030
- Did you drop it or something?
- Yeah.

01:20:05.998 --> 01:20:07.032
Oh. Here it is.

01:20:07.634 --> 01:20:08.967
Here it is.

01:20:09.001 --> 01:20:10.169
Here, it fucking is.

01:20:11.003 --> 01:20:12.705
Oh, fuck.

01:20:12.739 --> 01:20:14.039
Please, God.

01:20:14.072 --> 01:20:15.507
Fuck. Please.

01:20:15.541 --> 01:20:17.242
- Please don't kill me.
- Start the car!

01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:18.711
Okay. Okay.

01:20:20.078 --> 01:20:22.181
Start the car.

01:20:23.783 --> 01:20:25.752
Please...

01:20:25.785 --> 01:20:27.152
What the fuck...

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.588
Oh, fuck.

01:20:29.621 --> 01:20:31.457
Stop saying "Fuck."

01:20:50.743 --> 01:20:52.110
Hands on your head.

01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:56.415
Don't try...

01:20:57.717 --> 01:20:58.751
Fuck!

01:20:59.418 --> 01:21:00.419
Slow.

01:21:04.757 --> 01:21:06.058
Walk.

01:21:06.091 --> 01:21:07.392
- That way.
- What do you want?

01:21:07.426 --> 01:21:08.427
Move it!

01:21:11.129 --> 01:21:13.499
And go down the stairs.

01:21:14.399 --> 01:21:15.702
Down the stairs!

01:21:15.735 --> 01:21:17.603
- I'm not going down there.
- You're not going down the stairs?

01:21:17.637 --> 01:21:19.037
One...

01:21:19.071 --> 01:21:21.273
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:21:21.306 --> 01:21:23.275
Oh, fuck.

01:21:25.477 --> 01:21:26.813
- Oh, fuck.
- Okay?

01:21:30.115 --> 01:21:31.216
Go to the chair.

01:21:32.584 --> 01:21:33.720
Go to the chair.

01:21:38.557 --> 01:21:40.459
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

01:22:45.858 --> 01:22:46.859
Oh, fuck.

01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:53.098
Why didn't you call
an ambulance for my son?

01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:58.236
I did call an ambulance.

01:23:01.506 --> 01:23:02.642
Why do you lie?

01:23:05.344 --> 01:23:06.813
I'm not lying, okay?

01:23:11.316 --> 01:23:14.787
Listen to me. A lot of people drank too much
that night and I called the ambulance, okay?

01:23:14.821 --> 01:23:16.723
I didn't want anybody
to get hurt.

01:23:16.756 --> 01:23:19.726
I swear to God,
I didn't want anybody to get hurt.

01:23:19.759 --> 01:23:22.394
- Please...
- Are you sick of this?

01:23:22.427 --> 01:23:24.596
Are you sick of this?

01:23:27.867 --> 01:23:29.434
Have you had enough?

01:23:31.671 --> 01:23:33.605
My son...

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.541
got to have a lot of drinks
that night, didn't he?

01:23:37.777 --> 01:23:39.344
That was thoughtful.

01:23:51.991 --> 01:23:53.592
Maybe you'd like a little drink.

01:24:03.602 --> 01:24:04.603
Don't move.

01:24:18.818 --> 01:24:19.819
Have a shot.

01:24:22.387 --> 01:24:23.923
Atta boy.

01:24:23.956 --> 01:24:27.660
Ah, you drink up.
There you go.

01:24:27.694 --> 01:24:28.761
You feel better?

01:24:29.696 --> 01:24:31.196
Let me ask you something.

01:24:33.365 --> 01:24:36.636
Did my son
get a glass that night?

01:24:36.669 --> 01:24:37.870
I don't think so.

01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:40.640
I think...

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:42.541
he got...

01:24:46.445 --> 01:24:48.447
booze poured down
his throat.

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.882
- Open up.
- Okay!

01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:54.787
That's a boy. That's a boy.

01:24:54.821 --> 01:24:56.723
I want to make sure
you get the same treatment...

01:24:56.756 --> 01:24:58.390
- Oh, God.
- ...my son got. Open up.

01:25:00.827 --> 01:25:01.828
Thank you.

01:25:02.762 --> 01:25:04.596
There. Now...

01:25:11.704 --> 01:25:14.573
Oh, fuck,
please put the fucking gun down.

01:25:14.606 --> 01:25:16.441
Please.
I'll do anything you want.

01:25:16.475 --> 01:25:18.376
I'll do anything you want.
I'll do anything you want.

01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:19.712
- Please, don't fucking shoot me.
- You will?

01:25:19.746 --> 01:25:20.780
Holy shit!

01:25:20.813 --> 01:25:21.814
Don't...

01:25:23.649 --> 01:25:24.616
say "Holy shit."

01:25:24.650 --> 01:25:26.786
Don't swear in front of me,
it's not polite.

01:25:28.353 --> 01:25:29.354
Please.

01:25:30.622 --> 01:25:31.891
I told my son,

01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:36.628
"Don't have a bad habit
of swearing like your mom,"

01:25:37.063 --> 01:25:39.065
because I swear.

01:25:39.098 --> 01:25:42.400
I have a bad temper
sometimes.

01:25:42.434 --> 01:25:45.303
And I said, "That's not classy, Jimmy.
You shouldn't do that."

01:25:46.038 --> 01:25:47.874
"Shouldn't make that a habit."

01:25:47.907 --> 01:25:50.442
You know what else
you shouldn't make a habit?

01:25:50.475 --> 01:25:52.544
Of drinking too much.

01:25:52.577 --> 01:25:54.013
Because you're the president,
aren't you?

01:25:54.046 --> 01:25:55.782
Aren't you the president
of the fraternity? Yeah.

01:25:55.815 --> 01:25:56.949
What? Huh?

01:25:56.983 --> 01:25:58.818
- Yes, I'm the president.
- I can't hear you.

01:25:58.851 --> 01:26:00.385
I'm the president
of the fraternity.

01:26:00.418 --> 01:26:01.586
I thought so.

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:03.622
What do you believe in?
Do you believe in...

01:26:04.456 --> 01:26:06.391
...honor?

01:26:06.424 --> 01:26:07.492
I believe in honor.

01:26:09.061 --> 01:26:10.797
- Friendship?
- Friendship.

01:26:13.565 --> 01:26:15.600
- Loyalty?
- Loyalty.

01:26:15.635 --> 01:26:16.769
And virtue.

01:26:18.671 --> 01:26:21.439
- And virtue.
- Did you just say... Did you say...

01:26:21.473 --> 01:26:24.509
Did you just say,
"I believe in friendship"?

01:26:25.711 --> 01:26:27.512
Because you were quite a friend
to my son.

01:26:27.546 --> 01:26:29.015
I'm gonna offer you
a non-alcoholic drink.

01:26:29.048 --> 01:26:32.819
- We got to get you something non-alcoholic...
- Oh, fuck!

01:26:32.852 --> 01:26:35.420
so you don't make
an ass of yourself

01:26:35.453 --> 01:26:38.891
- in front of the important people...
- Oh, my God.

01:26:38.925 --> 01:26:41.794
- Please.
- ...that come by, like maybe dignitaries.

01:26:41.828 --> 01:26:43.796
- Here, here, here.
- What is this?

01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:45.330
Fucking bitch.

01:26:47.532 --> 01:26:49.568
Fucking bitch.

01:26:49.601 --> 01:26:50.770
You fucking bitch!

01:26:50.803 --> 01:26:52.470
You're fucking crazy!

01:26:52.504 --> 01:26:54.674
You're fucking crazy!

01:26:55.975 --> 01:26:58.644
- You pissed on my son. Right?
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

01:26:58.678 --> 01:27:00.947
I didn't know
what was gonna happen.

01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:02.682
I'm sorry.

01:27:02.715 --> 01:27:03.850
I'm s...

01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:06.953
I'm sorry.

01:27:07.619 --> 01:27:08.620
You know what?

01:27:10.690 --> 01:27:13.025
I don't accept bad manners...

01:27:13.059 --> 01:27:14.827
because when my kids
had a play date

01:27:14.861 --> 01:27:16.494
and we had a friend over
that had bad manners,

01:27:16.528 --> 01:27:17.964
I would always call the parents and say...

01:27:17.997 --> 01:27:19.397
"Who fucked this kid up?"

01:27:19.431 --> 01:27:20.532
You know why?

01:27:20.565 --> 01:27:22.101
Because,

01:27:22.134 --> 01:27:25.905
quite honestly, it's really hard
when you have four kids

01:27:25.938 --> 01:27:28.473
and they have a friend over
and the friend's a jerk.

01:27:30.042 --> 01:27:31.576
Because my son Jimmy,

01:27:33.578 --> 01:27:36.749
has a sister Kelly,

01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:40.186
a sister Ciara,

01:27:40.219 --> 01:27:41.888
and a brother, Sean.

01:27:43.588 --> 01:27:45.523
And my son,

01:27:45.557 --> 01:27:47.860
he loved his big brother.

01:27:49.561 --> 01:27:51.396
And now
you're going to tell me

01:27:52.131 --> 01:27:53.833
right now,

01:27:54.901 --> 01:27:57.937
who killed my son?

01:27:57.970 --> 01:28:02.642
And if you don't say
I... I have to kill you.

01:28:02.675 --> 01:28:04.509
- Please don't.
- And then my son...

01:28:05.543 --> 01:28:07.179
Please don't kill me.

01:28:07.213 --> 01:28:08.915
isn't gonna have a mother.

01:28:08.948 --> 01:28:11.616
- Please.
- Who killed my son?

01:28:11.651 --> 01:28:15.788
You're gonna tell me
who killed my son.

01:28:15.821 --> 01:28:20.092
And I'm gonna call your mom
and your dad.

01:28:20.126 --> 01:28:21.127
When your parents
answer the phone,

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.561
you're gonna tell them
you killed Jimmy O'Brien.

01:28:23.595 --> 01:28:25.831
Get it? Or I'm gonna
pull the trigger.

01:28:25.865 --> 01:28:27.133
On the count of three, okay?

01:28:29.501 --> 01:28:31.503
Say it.

01:28:31.536 --> 01:28:34.439
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mom?

01:28:36.776 --> 01:28:38.978
Mom, it's... Mom, it's Steven.

01:28:40.246 --> 01:28:41.546
Good boy.

01:28:41.579 --> 01:28:44.183
<i>Steven, what are you saying?</i>

01:28:44.216 --> 01:28:46.052
<i>What are you saying, honey?
You okay?</i>

01:28:46.085 --> 01:28:47.653
<i>Put him on speaker.</i>

01:28:47.687 --> 01:28:49.789
Help me, Mom.

01:28:49.822 --> 01:28:53.025
- Hmm.
- <i>I can't understand you, sweetie.</i>

01:28:53.059 --> 01:28:54.860
Mom.

01:28:54.894 --> 01:28:57.595
<i>Here's Dad.
I'm gonna put you on speaker, hon.</i>

01:28:58.197 --> 01:28:59.564
<i>Your dad's on.</i>

01:28:59.597 --> 01:29:01.233
I killed Jimmy O'Brien, Mom.

01:29:01.801 --> 01:29:03.235
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:29:03.269 --> 01:29:07.907
- You had nothing to do with Jimmy O'Brien.
- That's nonsense.

01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:10.042
That is nonsense.
That boy drank too much.

01:29:10.076 --> 01:29:12.244
You had nothing to do
with that, honey.

01:29:12.278 --> 01:29:13.879
- <i>Mom, please...</i>
- No.

01:29:22.221 --> 01:29:23.588
Steven.

01:29:23.621 --> 01:29:25.257
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:29:25.291 --> 01:29:26.792
Oh, my God.

01:29:26.826 --> 01:29:28.160
Oh, my God. Where is he?

01:29:28.194 --> 01:29:29.695
Steven!

01:29:29.729 --> 01:29:31.998
Steven! No!

01:29:32.031 --> 01:29:33.065
Steven!

01:29:35.067 --> 01:29:36.268
Steven!

01:29:49.048 --> 01:29:50.649
Is this the campus police?

01:29:52.184 --> 01:29:54.820
I want to report a student...

01:29:54.854 --> 01:29:58.556
<i>you need to go see
at 26 1/2 Hoffman Lane.</i>

01:31:41.794 --> 01:31:42.895
Rise and shine!

01:31:57.243 --> 01:31:59.211
Better than my cooking,
I guess, huh?

01:31:59.245 --> 01:32:00.379
Way better.

01:32:00.412 --> 01:32:02.381
All right. Relax.

01:32:02.414 --> 01:32:03.749
These are the best.

01:32:05.985 --> 01:32:08.220
Can you go to the store
and get me the shampoo I like?

01:32:08.254 --> 01:32:11.357
Dad keeps getting me 2-in-1
and it literally...

01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:13.792
Yeah, and he keeps
buying whole wheat bread.

01:32:13.826 --> 01:32:15.161
Seriously. Who does that?

01:32:15.895 --> 01:32:16.929
Exactly.

01:32:18.764 --> 01:32:19.832
How you doing?

01:32:23.269 --> 01:32:24.270
Good.

01:32:32.778 --> 01:32:34.747
Okay, guys. Okay.

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.048
Hop out, hop out.
You're late.

01:32:37.316 --> 01:32:40.019
Hop on out. We're late.
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:32:42.755 --> 01:32:44.456
- Love you.
- You gotta get that door fixed, Mom.

01:32:44.490 --> 01:32:46.325
- It's ridiculous.
- I know, it's ridiculous.

01:32:46.358 --> 01:32:48.060
All right, anyway,
love you.

01:32:48.093 --> 01:32:50.229
- Love you.
- Bye, Mom. Love you.

01:32:50.262 --> 01:32:51.430
Pick us up at 3:00.

01:32:51.463 --> 01:32:52.932
Yeah. Don't be late.

01:32:52.965 --> 01:32:53.966
Love you.

01:33:32.037 --> 01:33:33.038
I'm so sorry.

01:33:34.139 --> 01:33:35.140
I'm really sorry.

01:33:47.119 --> 01:33:49.188
Sheriff Bond?
Hi, it's Barbara O'Brien.

01:33:49.755 --> 01:33:51.323
You down at the office?

01:33:51.357 --> 01:33:52.524
Okay, I'm coming down.

01:33:55.194 --> 01:33:56.295
Hello, Barb.

01:33:56.862 --> 01:33:58.063
Just looking for you.

01:34:17.249 --> 01:34:19.918
I'm gonna need you guys
to step up. I...

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.055
I need you all to help me out.

01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:25.824
I know. I got it.

01:34:56.021 --> 01:34:59.358
<i>How, Mrs. O'Brien,
could you do something so barbaric?</i>

01:35:09.968 --> 01:35:11.603
<i>Answer the question,
Mrs. O'Brien.</i>

01:35:20.979 --> 01:35:22.414
<i>Because he killed
my son.</i>

01:35:25.484 --> 01:35:28.354
Well, why not at least make
the Croissions suffer through the night

01:35:28.387 --> 01:35:29.988
believing their son had died?

01:35:37.363 --> 01:35:39.231
<i>Because I thought
of his mother.</i>

01:35:40.399 --> 01:35:42.000
<i>You thought
of his mother?</i>

01:35:42.034 --> 01:35:44.002
<i>Yes.</i>

01:35:44.036 --> 01:35:46.505
- Were you friends?
- No.

01:35:46.538 --> 01:35:49.642
- Had you ever met before?
- No.

01:35:49.676 --> 01:35:53.212
Then why not let her suffer
through the night the way you did?

01:35:53.245 --> 01:35:54.279
Because...

01:35:55.648 --> 01:35:57.449
no mother deserves to suffer

01:35:59.218 --> 01:36:01.053
for more than two minutes

01:36:02.421 --> 01:36:04.323
knowing her son has died.

01:36:05.357 --> 01:36:06.358
Why?

01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:13.165
Because...

01:36:15.534 --> 01:36:16.636
It's unbearable.
