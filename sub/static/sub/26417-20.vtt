00:03.952 --> 00:06.022
Edwyn Huang,
I need the TV, pronto!

00:06.079 --> 00:07.126
Oh, okay.

00:07.212 --> 00:08.212
No.

00:09.167 --> 00:10.469
Is that grape jelly?

00:10.619 --> 00:12.282
PB&J burrito.
Want a bite?

00:12.368 --> 00:14.413
What about beans,
cheese, salsa?

00:14.693 --> 00:16.524
All that stuff's
in there, too, bro.

00:16.654 --> 00:18.727
Dear God.
You're a monster.

00:19.071 --> 00:20.110
I need the TV.

00:20.196 --> 00:21.352
My ass ain't moving.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.320
Every day after school,
I make a bomb-ass snack

00:23.406 --> 00:24.446
and watch MTV.

00:24.532 --> 00:26.336
In other words,
wasting time.

00:26.422 --> 00:27.821
Whoa!
It's not a waste!

00:27.907 --> 00:29.862
I learned everything I know
from these videos.

00:29.948 --> 00:31.946
I didn't have a handsome,
jacked older brother

00:32.031 --> 00:33.922
to teach me how to be cool.
I had MTV.

00:34.008 --> 00:35.852
No, thanks.
My letters of choice...

00:35.985 --> 00:37.730
Ah "P,"
ah "B," ah "S"...

00:37.815 --> 00:39.070
Ah PBS!

00:39.155 --> 00:41.800
Can you just stop
being a nerd for one second?

00:41.885 --> 00:44.688
Come on. Dude, this is
both music and a movie.

00:44.774 --> 00:45.774
It's double art.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.005
Hits you in your eyeballs

00:47.091 --> 00:48.993
and your ear... balls.

00:49.109 --> 00:51.894
I prefer imagination...
Theater of the mind.

00:51.980 --> 00:54.297
Fine.
Close your eyes, then.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.461

Nobody in this house gets me.

01:36.504 --> 01:37.912

01:56.550 --> 01:58.378
Come on.
I really need the TV.

01:58.464 --> 01:59.667
Sicily is
on her way over.

01:59.838 --> 02:02.486
Ooh.
Young lova's got a girlfriend.

02:02.754 --> 02:04.236
Please don't talk
in that voice.

02:04.322 --> 02:06.197
Need some tips
from your big bro?

02:06.283 --> 02:07.898
Lova' tips
for your girlfriend?

02:08.038 --> 02:10.032
You're the last person
I'd go to for advice.

02:10.119 --> 02:11.509
You're so annoying.

02:14.657 --> 02:16.842
<i>Native to south central
Arizona...</i>

02:17.192 --> 02:18.237
Nice!

02:18.330 --> 02:19.806
Put on
the most boring thing

02:19.892 --> 02:20.908
so she'll want
to smooch ya.

02:20.993 --> 02:22.378
Zack is coming over,
too!

02:22.464 --> 02:24.033
Wait.
So no making out?

02:24.119 --> 02:26.134
The three of you are
just gonna watch bird TV?

02:26.220 --> 02:28.008
Yes. We're birders.
We bird.

02:28.094 --> 02:29.650
Dude, you're going
to high school soon.

02:29.736 --> 02:31.712
- This bird crap...
- Isn't gonna fly.

02:31.798 --> 02:33.183
...is gonna
get you killed.

02:33.302 --> 02:35.712
Ed, in a few days,
a rare migration

02:35.798 --> 02:38.329
of the red-legged snail kites
is flying through town,

02:38.415 --> 02:40.165
and if we're not prepped
for the chase,

02:40.251 --> 02:41.766
I'd prefer death.

02:41.909 --> 02:43.580
Every time I think
you've reached peak nerd,

02:43.665 --> 02:45.306
you go and find
another nerd mountain to climb.

02:45.391 --> 02:46.986
Well,
lucky for both of us

02:47.072 --> 02:49.204
you're leaving soon
on your cultural exchange trip.

02:49.306 --> 02:50.900
I don't know.
Maybe I shouldn't go.

02:50.986 --> 02:52.823
I'm afraid what might
happen to you if I'm not here.

02:52.908 --> 02:56.603
I might come back to
some weird... half-man/half-book.

02:56.855 --> 02:58.790
My necktie
could be my bookmark.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.759
I could cite myself
as a source!

03:00.845 --> 03:03.013
- No, I didn't mean it as a good...
- Oh, my God.

03:03.098 --> 03:05.938
I could finally spend the night
at the library!

03:10.278 --> 03:11.663
Hola.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.251
Ma, what are you
wearing?

03:13.400 --> 03:14.954
A serape.

03:18.415 --> 03:19.985
Pure alpaca.

03:20.071 --> 03:21.423
- Alpaca?
- Internet boyfriend?

03:21.509 --> 03:25.000
Osvaldo,
an alpaca farmer in Chile.

03:25.085 --> 03:26.181
We e-mailed.

03:26.337 --> 03:29.053
He needed money
to build a new fence.

03:29.139 --> 03:30.868
Ma, you're not sending him
money, are you?

03:30.978 --> 03:33.410
You can't put a price
on this feeling.

03:33.495 --> 03:35.295
I feel so alive!

03:37.256 --> 03:40.086
Oh, Osvaldo...

03:42.882 --> 03:45.189
It's not funny.
She's clearly getting scammed.

03:45.275 --> 03:47.007
I'm not surprised.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.421
She's gullible! The whole side
of your family is.

03:49.507 --> 03:51.060
The Huangs
are not gullible.

03:51.145 --> 03:52.711
What about
when your brother tried to buy

03:52.796 --> 03:53.905
those "special" beans?

03:53.976 --> 03:56.370
Or when you thought
you could sit "reverse potty"?

03:56.455 --> 03:59.370
Or when you thought that rock
made your armpits smell good?

03:59.455 --> 04:01.970
The natural deodorant crystal
I'm still using?

04:02.055 --> 04:03.055
Gullible.

04:03.141 --> 04:04.749
I was afraid
the boys would inherit it.

04:04.835 --> 04:06.538
Being gullible
is not genetic.

04:06.624 --> 04:07.624
Yes, it is.

04:07.709 --> 04:09.155
If your ring finger
is the same length

04:09.240 --> 04:11.325
as your middle finger,
it means you're gullible.

04:11.411 --> 04:12.444
Is that true?

04:12.937 --> 04:15.335
Oh, ha ha.
Nice try.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.007
The point is,
my mom's being taken,

04:17.093 --> 04:18.444
and I've got to
shut it down.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.855
Brutal honesty...
That's the best way.

04:20.940 --> 04:21.956
Just tell her.

04:22.041 --> 04:23.726
You saw Ma.
She was so happy.

04:23.812 --> 04:25.523
She'd be crushed
if she knew it was all fake.

04:25.608 --> 04:28.853
People who fall for scams
deserve to feel humiliated.

04:28.967 --> 04:30.710
That's how they learn.

04:30.841 --> 04:33.116
If you don't tell her,
I will.

04:36.528 --> 04:39.069
Oh. I need
some more crystal.

04:40.937 --> 04:41.912
Oh, hey.

04:41.997 --> 04:43.152
You want
my banana costume?

04:43.237 --> 04:44.820
It'd be a shame to just
let it sit here for a month.

04:44.905 --> 04:47.272
And neglect
my own fruit costumes?

04:47.420 --> 04:48.991
Can you take my friends and me
to the mall?

04:49.076 --> 04:50.362
Look who suddenly
wants to hang out

04:50.447 --> 04:51.711
with their annoying
older brother.

04:51.796 --> 04:52.827
Just get to it.

04:52.913 --> 04:54.780
What do I have to do...
Drink sour milk,

04:54.866 --> 04:57.041
eat a toenail,
lick your booger wall?

04:57.127 --> 04:59.585
Nah. I'll take you.
I want to shop for a subwoofer.

04:59.689 --> 05:02.155
Plus, I can teach you
the cool way to mall-hang.

05:02.257 --> 05:04.437
First, we enter through
the back-alley service entrance,

05:04.522 --> 05:06.530
pop some Bubble Tape,
read some boobie graffiti...

05:06.616 --> 05:08.879
We just need to pick up
some bird gear and clothes

05:08.965 --> 05:10.327
- for the big day.
- Like...

05:10.413 --> 05:11.569
a cool pair of jeans?

05:11.679 --> 05:14.069
Like some sun hats,
sketch pads,

05:14.155 --> 05:16.429
and a few waist satchels
to carry our lip balm.

05:16.515 --> 05:18.303
Now, please
don't embarrass me.

05:18.389 --> 05:20.180
You're going to the mall
to buy fanny packs for birding,

05:20.265 --> 05:21.355
and you're worried
about me?

05:21.449 --> 05:22.457
Just please...

05:22.554 --> 05:24.611
Don't lock the windows, fart,
and crank the heat.

05:24.697 --> 05:25.702
How dare you.

05:25.788 --> 05:27.053
I would never
crank the heat.

05:27.256 --> 05:29.022
AC preserves the fart.

05:41.122 --> 05:42.981
I've been asking you
to do that for years.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.489
Boy, you were right.
It needed it.

05:44.575 --> 05:47.120
Sucker's really drinking it up.
May need four coats.

05:47.206 --> 05:48.686
Why'd you paint "gullible"
on the ceiling?

05:48.771 --> 05:49.895
Huh?

05:50.059 --> 05:51.315
I did not look.
I'm not gullible.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.575
Yes, you are!

05:52.661 --> 05:55.020
But I'm not, and I'm not
falling for this charade.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.544
You're delaying
breaking the news to your mom.

05:59.021 --> 06:00.318
Where are you going
with your bank pig?

06:00.403 --> 06:03.317
I'm giving my money to Grandma
so she can help out her friend.

06:04.919 --> 06:06.966
Emery, you can't do that.
Listen...

06:07.052 --> 06:08.350
You know how I've been
searching for my thing...

06:08.435 --> 06:10.536
Volleyball, line dancing,
flight attendant?

06:10.622 --> 06:12.777
Well, this is it...
Helping people.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.708
Philanthropy
is my passion.

06:16.712 --> 06:17.712
Hm.

06:19.630 --> 06:20.755
We can't tell Grandma.

06:20.841 --> 06:23.552
Oh, I thought "brutal honesty"
was the best policy.

06:23.638 --> 06:26.323
Well, that was when it was
about fake Latin lovers.

06:26.503 --> 06:28.770
This is about
our son's personal fulfillment.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.474
I am just glad
you're on board.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.138
Now, let's ruin
this scam artist.

06:32.224 --> 06:34.302
After you tape off
the moldings.

06:34.934 --> 06:36.302
Just because
you're fake-painting

06:36.388 --> 06:38.098
doesn't mean
you can do a sloppy job.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.254
Okay, guys,
favorite plover.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.692
Favorite plover?

06:42.778 --> 06:44.076
I need a break
from this nerd talk.

06:44.161 --> 06:45.575
You guys
ever heard of...

06:45.763 --> 06:47.421
"Enter the Wu-Tang:
36 Chambers"?

06:47.507 --> 06:49.325
Or was that
before you were born?

06:49.411 --> 06:50.996
Oh, no.
Here he goes.

06:51.082 --> 06:52.614
I remember the first time
I heard it.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.345
I was 9.
It was Christmas morning.

06:54.431 --> 06:55.489
Santa brought it?

06:55.575 --> 06:56.575
Please!

06:56.661 --> 06:58.145
Wu-Tang would melt
Santa's face.

06:58.231 --> 06:59.974
I caught "Protect Ya Neck"
on MTV.

07:00.136 --> 07:01.611
That music video
changed my life.

07:01.759 --> 07:03.713
It's not music.
It's just talking.

07:03.799 --> 07:06.737
Method Man, ODB,
RZA, Ghostface, Raekwon,

07:06.823 --> 07:08.526
spitting about Shaolin,
killer bees...

07:08.612 --> 07:09.823
chess!

07:10.456 --> 07:12.549
How did you learn
all this?

07:12.635 --> 07:13.901
Oh, from sup-dawg.

07:13.987 --> 07:15.276
What's sup-dawg?

07:15.362 --> 07:17.284
I don't know.
What's up with you, dawg?

07:18.471 --> 07:19.479
Here we go.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.221
Wu-Tang is
for the children.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.612

07:32.793 --> 07:35.179
And then we head over to the
food court for some free samples

07:35.264 --> 07:38.026
and hover over the hot dog stand
like a ghetto bird.

07:39.361 --> 07:40.737
A helicopter.

07:41.592 --> 07:43.276
Okay.
We'll navigate the mall

07:43.362 --> 07:45.417
like civilized consumers,
thank you.

07:45.538 --> 07:47.706
Suit yourself.
Peace out, homies.

07:49.995 --> 07:50.780
What's a homie?

07:50.865 --> 07:52.005
I don't know.

07:52.627 --> 07:55.198
I'm sorry, guys.
He can be... a lot.

07:55.284 --> 07:57.168
Well, he seems to know
how to get around the mall.

07:57.253 --> 07:59.596
Never hurts
to try a different route.

07:59.989 --> 08:01.144
You're going with Eddie?

08:02.439 --> 08:04.863
Do you know what happens when a
peanut goes down a different route?

08:04.948 --> 08:07.487
Choke city!
Do you want that?!

08:10.519 --> 08:13.164
And boom!
We enter like ballers.

08:13.338 --> 08:15.838
You're so lucky to have
an older brother, Evan.

08:15.924 --> 08:17.065
You hear that, Evan?

08:17.151 --> 08:19.846
Well, I know you have some
important shopping to get to.

08:19.940 --> 08:21.314
I'm in the market
for a subwoofer.

08:21.399 --> 08:24.502
Really? I've been thinking about
getting a woof-woof myself.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.529
You know
what I'm sayin', homie?

08:27.010 --> 08:29.002
Hey, why don't we all
go together?

08:29.099 --> 08:30.700
Because Eddie's route
goes through

08:30.786 --> 08:32.138
the cover-your-eyes part
of the mall...

08:32.222 --> 08:34.472
Victoria's Secret,
Spencer's Gifts,

08:34.558 --> 08:35.754
and the rest
of the risqué.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.051
Diesel Jeans
is over there.

08:37.136 --> 08:38.981
It's not risqué.
It's just Italian men stuff.

08:39.067 --> 08:40.933
More like dungarees
for fancy farmers.

08:41.019 --> 08:41.924
Right, guys?

08:42.010 --> 08:43.256
I don't know.
Seems durable.

08:43.370 --> 08:45.136
Guys, we're here
for birding supplies.

08:45.222 --> 08:47.925
Relax, Evan. Your friends
just want to be cool.

08:50.870 --> 08:51.885
I got it!

08:52.002 --> 08:53.667
You and I fly to Chile,

08:53.753 --> 08:55.097
pose as FBI agents,

08:55.183 --> 08:57.144
and threaten Osvaldo
with global fraud.

08:57.230 --> 09:00.074
I call it
Operation Chile Explosion.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.505
I'm still brainstorming
the name.

09:01.591 --> 09:03.136
You need more brain
and less storm.

09:03.222 --> 09:06.082
Louis, this isn't some
criminal mastermind in Chile.

09:06.168 --> 09:07.469
This is a fatso
in Des Moines,

09:07.532 --> 09:09.887
sitting in front of a computer,
gobbling marshmallows.

09:09.972 --> 09:12.009
Oh, I don't know why we have to
be size-ist about this,

09:12.094 --> 09:13.383
but sure,
let's go to Iowa.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.430
Or we just write him an e-mail
and scare him off.

09:15.516 --> 09:17.813
Oh, what, just magically
hack into my mom's account

09:17.899 --> 09:18.828
and get his info?

09:18.914 --> 09:20.539
I already guessed
her password.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.672
It's 1-1-1-1.

09:22.879 --> 09:25.249
You're right.
She's a genius.

09:28.085 --> 09:30.227
Look, I appreciate you guys
humoring Eddie,

09:30.313 --> 09:31.699
but please don't do it
on my behalf.

09:31.784 --> 09:32.852
It only encourages him.

09:32.938 --> 09:34.084
What are you
talking about?

09:34.170 --> 09:35.524
Yeah, he's the best.

09:35.610 --> 09:36.688
That guy?

Here's to no more
innocent victims being scammed.

10:17.126 --> 10:18.677
His response
was so pathetic...

10:18.763 --> 10:20.150
"Please, no jail.

10:20.236 --> 10:23.103
I'm crying in fear.
My family is innocent."

10:23.189 --> 10:25.361
That was smart threatening
to cut off his hands.

10:25.447 --> 10:26.704
Computer guys
and their hands.

10:26.790 --> 10:27.606
Mm.

10:27.692 --> 10:28.845
Hey!

10:29.780 --> 10:32.462
Is that...
made from alpaca fur?

10:32.548 --> 10:33.650
Yep.

10:33.736 --> 10:35.228
An Osvaldo special.

10:35.331 --> 10:36.907
He sent it
as a thank-you.

10:36.993 --> 10:40.111
I speak Spanish, so I helped
your mom correspond with him.

10:40.345 --> 10:41.573
Boy, did they.

10:41.659 --> 10:43.514
I don't think
you want me to write that.

10:43.615 --> 10:45.390
That means you want him
to touch your...

10:45.476 --> 10:47.814
Type-y type-y.

10:50.222 --> 10:51.525
- Ew.
- That's my mother.

10:51.611 --> 10:53.496
Osvaldo's no choirboy,
either.

10:53.582 --> 10:56.111
Honey, you know this is all
an Internet scam, right?

10:56.335 --> 10:58.626
This sex machine Osvaldo...
He isn't real.

10:58.712 --> 11:00.098
Yeah, he was just
stringing my mom along

11:00.183 --> 11:01.328
so she'd send him money.

11:01.414 --> 11:02.462
But he gave it back.

11:02.571 --> 11:04.736
I saw the check.
He sent it with our gifts.

11:05.053 --> 11:06.962
Osvaldo is real?

11:10.228 --> 11:12.173
Z and Sicily,
in the place to be.

11:12.259 --> 11:14.079
That was a freestyle.

11:14.165 --> 11:16.590
Evan's just getting ready,
but you're welcome to join me.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.483
Sure.
What'cha watchin', E-man?

11:19.568 --> 11:21.776
Uh, this is a commercial
for tomatoes.

11:21.862 --> 11:22.917
Dope.

11:23.738 --> 11:26.167
But "Yo! MTV Raps"
is what's on.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.828
Oh. Maybe we can
catch Wu-Tang!

11:30.600 --> 11:32.526
Who's all ready to bird?

11:32.612 --> 11:33.812
What are you wearing?

11:35.588 --> 11:38.128
Oh. These?

11:38.513 --> 11:40.808
My birding jeans.

11:40.970 --> 11:43.140
Or my B.J.s.

11:43.691 --> 11:46.046
I've never seen you
wear jeans.

11:46.435 --> 11:48.135
These are
carpenter cut.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.479
Got a loop here...
For my... hammer.

11:51.565 --> 11:52.800
You don't have a hammer.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.629
If you wanted
fashion advice,

11:55.714 --> 11:57.331
should've just come
to your big bro.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.526
Well, the saleswoman,
Gita,

11:59.612 --> 12:01.815
says these are the style
right now.

12:08.704 --> 12:09.743
Little stiff.

12:09.829 --> 12:11.852
Just needs a bit of breaking in,
a wash or two.

12:11.938 --> 12:13.008
Ready?

12:13.094 --> 12:14.805
Hey, Eddie,
you should come with us.

12:14.891 --> 12:15.860
It'll be fun.

12:15.946 --> 12:18.165
We could listen to one of
your mixes on the way there.

12:18.251 --> 12:19.966
I just finished a sick one
for Taiwan.

12:20.090 --> 12:21.188
It's gonna
blow your minds.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.289
You're coming?
Bird watching?

12:23.375 --> 12:25.620
Yeah. Why not?
I'm great at I Spy.

12:25.790 --> 12:26.837
I spy...

12:26.923 --> 12:28.423
the top button
of your jeans popping.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.659
Don't you
have better things to do?

12:30.745 --> 12:33.200
Like sitting, eating,
more sitting?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.149
You mean like
the things that kings do?

12:35.337 --> 12:36.899
Let's bird.

12:46.673 --> 12:49.227
No sign
of a snail kite yet.

12:49.430 --> 12:50.587
No,
but I finished

12:50.673 --> 12:52.860
the black-whiskered vireo
I've been watching.

12:52.979 --> 12:55.540
Oh, "bird"? I thought
we were nerd watching.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.259
I've been drawing Zack.

13:01.845 --> 13:04.219
I love it
when you bust my yams, E.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.848
Can you guys quiet down
the love-fest over there?

13:06.957 --> 13:09.032
We don't want to scare
the red-legged snail kite.

13:09.118 --> 13:10.444
Did you ever notice
that every bird's

13:10.529 --> 13:11.774
just a body part
and a color?

13:11.881 --> 13:13.966
"There's
a purple-butt flapper."

13:14.300 --> 13:16.204
Um, "The
rainbow-nut pheasant."

13:17.150 --> 13:18.337
That's enough!

13:19.423 --> 13:20.720
The red-faced lil' bro.

13:20.806 --> 13:22.345
You know what you call a bird
that hangs out with birds

13:22.430 --> 13:23.501
three years its junior?

13:23.587 --> 13:24.954
A loser!

13:25.143 --> 13:26.798
Oh, you don't like
that bird?

13:26.884 --> 13:28.891
Well, I got two more for you
right here!

13:29.129 --> 13:32.226
Yeeaaaaah!

13:34.115 --> 13:36.892
__

13:39.056 --> 13:42.222
- I'm a loser?
- If you have to ask "Who's the loser?",

13:42.308 --> 13:43.723
it usually means
it's you.

13:43.808 --> 13:45.251
Coming from bird boy,
that's rich.

13:45.337 --> 13:47.752
You're always trying to give me
"hot tips" on how to be cool.

13:47.838 --> 13:49.093
Well,
here's one for you...

13:49.158 --> 13:51.004
Instead of stealing
your little brother's friends,

13:51.089 --> 13:52.859
find some your own age.

13:53.850 --> 13:56.035
Well, I'm sorry for wanting
to hang out with you.

13:56.229 --> 13:57.944
And FYI,
those are women's jeans.

13:58.177 --> 13:59.762
No, they're Jordans!

13:59.848 --> 14:01.111
Jordache.

14:05.144 --> 14:06.159
I got it!

14:06.245 --> 14:07.546
So, we may have ruined

14:07.632 --> 14:09.149
my mom's shot at love
with her pen pal,

14:09.234 --> 14:10.649
but she's never
seen this guy, right?

14:10.734 --> 14:11.719
Not with her eyes.

14:11.804 --> 14:14.499
But the way he describes
his body in these e-mails...

14:14.585 --> 14:16.019
The man can paint a picture.

14:16.187 --> 14:18.189
Okay, hear me out.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.320
We hire someone
to act as Osvaldo

14:20.406 --> 14:21.749
and sweetly
break up with her.

14:21.835 --> 14:23.977
There's a bagger at the Piggly
Wiggly from El Salvador.

14:24.062 --> 14:26.147
No, we have to tell her
the truth, like I wanted to

14:26.233 --> 14:27.873
- from the beginn...
- Tell who the truth?

14:29.607 --> 14:31.192
Louis...

14:31.278 --> 14:33.304
I need to talk the talk
if I'm gonna walk the walk.

14:33.390 --> 14:34.555
I don't think
this is a good idea.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.413
It's time.
Brutal honesty.

14:36.499 --> 14:38.062
- Emery.
- Please don't do this.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.327
You see, we thought.

14:39.456 --> 14:41.281
Grandma's friend
in South America was...

14:41.367 --> 14:42.968
Was a scam.
I know.

14:43.054 --> 14:44.640
I wasn't really
gonna give her my money.

14:44.726 --> 14:45.984
Then why did you say
you were?

14:46.070 --> 14:47.140
Dad told me to.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.535
Well, what about
finding your passion?

14:50.620 --> 14:52.109
That part was true.
I did.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.368
But it's not
helping people.

14:53.454 --> 14:54.718
It's acting!

14:55.071 --> 14:56.710
You totally believed me.

14:58.528 --> 15:00.613
You turned our son
into an actor!

15:00.699 --> 15:03.432
Flight attendant feels like
an attorney compared to this!

15:03.518 --> 15:05.174
I was just trying
to protect my mom.

15:05.260 --> 15:06.402
Well, who's gonna
protect you?

15:06.487 --> 15:08.448
I can't believe
you scammed me!

15:08.534 --> 15:11.049
Well, people who are gullible
enough to fall for scams

15:11.135 --> 15:12.220
deserve what they get.

15:12.306 --> 15:13.315
That's how they learn.

15:13.401 --> 15:14.846
Well, nice scam, Louis.

15:14.932 --> 15:16.347
You didn't even
take my money.

15:16.743 --> 15:18.213
Amateur.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.651
Hey, Eddie.
Mind if I watch, too?

15:26.266 --> 15:29.073
Just take my spot.
I'm gonna go pack for the trip.

15:29.159 --> 15:30.542
Hey, in a few days,

15:30.628 --> 15:32.651
you'll get a nice break
from your loser brother.

15:37.782 --> 15:38.867
Whoa.

15:38.953 --> 15:40.534
Eddie never yields
his spot on the couch

15:40.620 --> 15:41.642
when his show's on.

15:41.728 --> 15:42.775
He's mad at me.

15:42.861 --> 15:43.837
I messed up,

15:43.923 --> 15:45.708
and I don't know
how to get through to him.

15:45.794 --> 15:47.392
This sucks.

15:52.193 --> 15:53.704
What song is this?

15:53.790 --> 15:54.875
It's nice.

<i>♪ ...waterfalls ♪</i>

16:56.040 --> 16:58.755
I, uh, thought
I'd make a big dinner

16:58.841 --> 17:00.456
to try and make up
for everything.

17:00.548 --> 17:01.833
How do I know
that's true?

17:01.919 --> 17:03.470
Maybe you cooked it
to eat all yourself.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.820
It's a 20-pound turkey.

17:04.906 --> 17:07.336
Is it? Or are you trying
to scam me with a giant chicken?

17:07.422 --> 17:09.047
Where's Evan?
He knows birds.

17:09.133 --> 17:11.125
There you go again...
Using one of our sons

17:11.211 --> 17:12.656
to help you
spin your lies.

17:12.742 --> 17:15.391
I'll admit, if I had been honest
with my mom from the beginning...

17:15.477 --> 17:17.633
Emery wouldn't want
to be an actor.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.414
Well, that, and I wouldn't
have hurt you...

17:19.500 --> 17:21.685
Or ruined her relationship
with Osvaldo.

17:21.771 --> 17:23.101
You did what?

17:24.664 --> 17:27.219
Ma, we thought he was
scamming you for your money.

17:27.305 --> 17:31.000
I was scamming him
for free alpaca gear.

17:31.102 --> 17:33.289
I already
flipped his gift

17:33.375 --> 17:36.160
for three times
of what I sent him.

17:36.246 --> 17:37.539
What?

17:37.625 --> 17:40.492
But I thought you said
Osvaldo made you feel so alive.

17:40.578 --> 17:41.672
Yeah.

17:41.758 --> 17:44.373
Tricking morons
is a rush.

17:44.459 --> 17:47.000
I've got
a bunch of scams going.

17:47.086 --> 17:48.901
That's why I love Florida.

17:48.994 --> 17:51.196
So many old idiots.

17:56.913 --> 17:59.063
Maybe you Huangs aren't
so gullible after all.

17:59.149 --> 18:00.662
That's right. We're crafty.

18:00.787 --> 18:01.972
Now let's eat.

18:02.024 --> 18:03.200
I can pig out
as much as I want

18:03.285 --> 18:05.696
since I bought this
Digestion Accelerator Band.

18:05.782 --> 18:08.219
The arrows let you know
it's facing the right direction.

18:08.789 --> 18:10.094
♪ Poppa and Puff ♪

18:10.180 --> 18:12.516
♪ Close like Starsky and Hutch,
stick the clutch ♪

18:12.602 --> 18:13.774
♪ Dare I squeeze three... ♪

18:13.860 --> 18:15.414
Why are you
listening to this?

18:16.173 --> 18:17.602
I'm using it
to get you in here.

18:17.688 --> 18:19.481
Like a bird call.
An Eddie call.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.721
You mean like
a mating call?

18:20.806 --> 18:22.451
Ew! Come on!

18:22.680 --> 18:24.672
I'm trying to tell you
I finally understand

18:24.758 --> 18:26.071
why you like
these music videos.

18:26.157 --> 18:28.211
I watched "Waterfalls,"
and it spoke to me.

18:28.297 --> 18:29.812
I totally
related to it...

18:29.977 --> 18:31.922
How we should be comfortable
with who we are

18:32.008 --> 18:33.363
and not chase
something we're not.

18:33.449 --> 18:34.764
That song's about HIV.

18:34.850 --> 18:36.617
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:36.751 --> 18:39.266
Well, I'm sorry
I called you a loser.

18:39.460 --> 18:40.797
I wish I could be
like you...

18:40.883 --> 18:42.930
Fun, relaxed,
instantly likeable.

18:43.016 --> 18:44.375
But I can't.

18:44.461 --> 18:46.146
You can be smart
when you choose to,

18:46.232 --> 18:47.914
but I can never be cool.

18:48.048 --> 18:49.463
Doesn't work that way.

18:49.580 --> 18:51.071
I thought that, too.

18:51.819 --> 18:54.336
But... after hanging out
with you,

18:54.422 --> 18:56.539
I realized
you're already cool.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.640
I am?

18:57.726 --> 18:58.617
Yeah!

18:58.703 --> 18:59.871
Anybody
with enough swagger

18:59.957 --> 19:01.689
to convince their friends
to go bird watching

19:01.774 --> 19:03.089
is doing just fine.

19:03.224 --> 19:04.797
Please. I can't
take the credit.

19:04.883 --> 19:06.524
The birds are
the real draw.

19:06.610 --> 19:08.408
And, hey, I wasn't trying
to hog your friends.

19:08.493 --> 19:11.235
I just wanted to spend time
with you before I leave.

19:11.321 --> 19:12.727
You're only going
for a few weeks.

19:12.813 --> 19:15.555
I mean leave leave...
Like, to college.

19:16.087 --> 19:18.282
For a year,
and then on to the NBA,

19:18.433 --> 19:20.696
and then to run
my own pizza empire.

19:20.782 --> 19:21.749
Pizza?

19:21.835 --> 19:23.524
Yeah. Hot dogs
have too much baggage.

19:23.610 --> 19:26.422
You know, with the whole
made-out-of-pig-butts stuff.

19:26.508 --> 19:27.762
How did we get here?

19:28.283 --> 19:29.969
Anyway,
you don't need my help.

19:30.055 --> 19:31.870
You'll be just fine
when I'm gone.

19:32.055 --> 19:33.306
Thanks, Eddie.

19:34.694 --> 19:36.689
Told ya you could be smart
when you want to.

19:36.916 --> 19:39.541
Maybe I'm not the only
Bibliosapien in the family.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.822
Half-man/half-book.

19:42.994 --> 19:45.252
Wait.
Which half of me is book?

19:45.338 --> 19:47.066
I-I still have my, uh...

19:47.268 --> 19:49.127
microphone. Right?

19:52.764 --> 19:54.744
The
woofer's rattling my chest!

19:54.836 --> 19:56.603
Hell yeah, it is!

19:57.090 --> 19:58.978
Eddie, what have you done
to our van?

19:59.064 --> 20:01.861

you're buying us a new one.
