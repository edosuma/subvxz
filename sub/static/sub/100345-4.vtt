00:22.240 --> 00:27.000
- Beautiful baby, your nephew.
- Thank you, Holy Father.

00:31.560 --> 00:32.640
Appreciate that.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.480
Sorry, I brought a gift for you.
A painting that I did.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.280
- Interesting, thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.960
So...

01:04.000 --> 01:07.160
You look a bit older,
and it might just be the beard.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.720
I have had a beard
since I was 31.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.840
I remember that amazing speech
you gave in Venice,

01:18.000 --> 01:19.800
but I don't remember
you having a beard, then.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.600
That was Pius XIII.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.360
- So who are you ?
- I'm John Paul III.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.000
Forgive me Holy Father.
You gotta understand,

01:43.120 --> 01:46.760
I've been in the studio
holed up for months

01:46.840 --> 01:49.680
and I don't really keep track
of the news so...

01:50.920 --> 01:52.120
What helps ?

01:53.120 --> 01:59.320
Potassium phosphate
mixed with a capsule of Xabol.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.240
So you're quite
the pharmaceutical adventurer.

02:05.720 --> 02:11.160
- So you are not Pius XIII ?
- No, I'm the new pope.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.280
May I asked
what happened to the old pope ?

02:15.080 --> 02:16.320
He is in coma

02:17.760 --> 02:22.560
and he had a successor, Francis II,
and he died.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.520
Have you gone to visit him ?

02:31.640 --> 02:34.200
- Who ?
- The pope in a coma.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.560
No, not yet.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.240
Maybe you should.

04:38.040 --> 04:42.760
THE NEW POPE
Episode 4

04:55.640 --> 04:57.960
What is it ? What is it ?

04:58.960 --> 05:02.360
That makes us feel so good together ?

05:02.880 --> 05:05.080
What is it ? What is it ?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.720
This great emotion ?

05:09.440 --> 05:11.960
God who tells you I have loved you

05:12.960 --> 05:15.480
And he's happy if he has shown it.

05:26.400 --> 05:31.240
Many, far too many
members of the clergy

05:32.080 --> 05:35.680
believe that love
is an infinite meadow

05:36.720 --> 05:40.160
and they are allowed to pick
all the flowers they want.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.960
But they are not picking flowers,

05:47.880 --> 05:50.520
they are ripping plants
from the earth

05:51.400 --> 05:53.440
and assuring by their actions

05:54.040 --> 05:59.160
that in the scorched
and barren soil they've defiled,

06:00.320 --> 06:02.880
nothing more will ever grow.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
This is what our Church
risks becoming.

06:15.880 --> 06:19.880
The world wants to see
pedophile priests hanged.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.840
But Jesus would not want this.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
Jesus is civility
and the Church can not,

06:31.600 --> 06:37.440
must not abandon her children,
especially if they are ill.

06:41.840 --> 06:45.320
But if they are ill,

06:47.320 --> 06:49.960
she must distance them

06:50.600 --> 06:54.480
from the heart
of the ecclesiastical life forever.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.720
Forever.

07:31.880 --> 07:36.440
I know it sounds trite, but seeing you
surrounded by all these men,

07:37.840 --> 07:40.120
makes me swell with pride.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.160
Is that what we're calling it now ?
Pride ?

07:47.520 --> 07:48.720
Your Holiness,

07:51.200 --> 07:55.360
when you have a minute,
I would like to show you something.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.240
A gift, from me to you,
Your Holiness.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.840
They told me
you only love Bentleys.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.560
So, this is the way
the real world works.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.880
Yes, this is how it works.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.680
I hope that you are not offended,
Your Holiness.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.040
It's only a welcome gift.
One that expects nothing in return.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.800
What could I possibly give in return,
Eminence ?

08:26.920 --> 08:29.400
I am only a primus inter pares.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.799
To be concrete,
you need to make appointments.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.400
I am never concrete.

08:38.840 --> 08:43.919
Do you remember when we slept
in the same room after the seminary ?

08:46.680 --> 08:49.920
What happy memories.
We were young then.

08:51.320 --> 08:55.000
All I remember
about my youth is my brother Adam.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.160
Do you still sleep with that silver box
next to your bed ?

09:04.480 --> 09:08.360
Actually you're right, of course,
we did sleep in the same room,

09:09.520 --> 09:15.400
I recall you had an endless stream
of young visitors, day and night, no ?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.920
If you allow me, Holy Father,

09:23.040 --> 09:27.960
I'd be happy to inform you sometime
of certain habits inside the Vatican.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.600
I very much allow you,
Eminence.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.320
Do it now, do tell,
straight away, I'm curious.

09:36.480 --> 09:40.200
In the Vatican, the choice is between
blackmail and benevolence.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.600
I always prefer the second option.
Don't you ?

09:47.200 --> 09:51.640
I never answer important questions
in the evening, Eminence.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.600
Especially after three glasses
of champagne.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.040
SECRETARIAT OF STATE

10:19.080 --> 10:24.160
Don't make me uncomfortable, get up.
What's happening today ?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.520
Please accept
my resignation, Eminence.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.960
Cut the bullshit ! Who's Lisette ?

10:30.240 --> 10:32.480
She's a nun who wanted
to confer with you,

10:32.600 --> 10:35.960
together with the abbess
from the convent of St. Therese.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.960
I did not consider it
necessary to ask you.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.880
Right, I do not deal
with minor matters,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.160
only with high, ethereal,
supernatural power.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.560
From the ethereal to the mire
is a short step.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.600
- Napoleon ?
- No, me.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.960
As they couldn't confer with you,
the nuns have gone on strike.

10:55.640 --> 10:59.760
- They've occupied the Sistine Chapel.
- Jesus, you should have told me !

10:59.880 --> 11:02.360
Since I've been in charge
there's never been a strike !

11:02.880 --> 11:04.360
What do those
wretched women want ?

11:04.880 --> 11:07.680
- It's a trifling matter.
- Couldn't you have dealt with it ?

11:07.880 --> 11:11.080
I thought I had with the usual wall
of indifference, but I was wrong.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.440
Let me speak to this abbess.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.520
- What does she want from me ?
- 200 euros.

11:19.480 --> 11:23.680
Matter resolved.
A quid pro quo in the chain of command.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.600
- May I swear ?
- Just once.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.200
Like fuck it is !
The matter is not resolved at all.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.680
Reverend Mother,

11:30.960 --> 11:34.680
Don Cavallo informed me
that you had requested 200 euro,

11:35.120 --> 11:37.760
in order to take Lisette's mother
to Lourdes.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.640
And I have just given you
200 euro.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.400
What we want now
is not what we wanted before.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.760
Our requests have changed.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.480
You don't understand.

11:54.760 --> 11:59.680
I understand everything,
but you need to be more clear.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.720
We sisters have joined together,

12:04.960 --> 12:09.120
and we now understand the difference
between charity and rights.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.760
- I am all ears.
- We demand respect.

12:16.160 --> 12:20.960
Social, moral, and economic recognition
for the duties we sisters perform.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.840
We want to be welcomed
into the bosom of the Church,

12:24.280 --> 12:28.440
to be granted a more active ministry,
including administering the sacraments.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.440
And, in general,
we expect the male clergy

12:31.520 --> 12:33.760
to adopt
a psychologically mature attitude

12:33.880 --> 12:36.200
in its relations
with us female members.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.280
Please clarify
this last point for me.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.480
Do you need me to elaborate on the sort
of things your brothers are capable of ?

12:45.560 --> 12:47.680
Not now, I don't have time.

12:47.880 --> 12:52.200
But a detailed, written account
would prove most useful.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.680
- That you shall have.
- No ! You won't.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.680
It's a trap, Reverend Mother.
We will be dismissed as tattlers,

13:00.200 --> 13:04.040
and he will have a record
of all his accomplices' depravities,

13:04.120 --> 13:06.080
the better to blackmail them with.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.560
Spectacular, the talent !

13:11.160 --> 13:13.000
This will be a long war,

13:13.080 --> 13:16.520
though it will end as they all do:
with my victory.

13:17.440 --> 13:21.720
But you, Sister Lisette,
will make a formidable adversary.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.840
You can bet on that.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.000
- Now what are you doing ?
- I'm dismissing you.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.160
Then we will carry on
with our strike.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.320
Fine. And we priests
will learn how to cook,

13:39.720 --> 13:43.160
and wash, and iron our robes;
it's about time.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.600
Be careful, Sister Lisette.

13:57.760 --> 14:02.200
Your rights are one thing,
the rites of the Church are another.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.880
The former are negotiable,
for they belong to man,

14:07.520 --> 14:11.160
but the latter are not,
for they belong to God.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.800
That's better.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.720
You haven't joined
your sisters' protest ?

14:35.800 --> 14:38.080
No. Me, no.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.840
Why not ?

14:42.720 --> 14:45.960
Because I decided
to believe in you.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.440
What are your sisters
asking for ?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.520
Respect.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.880
Don't you need respect ?

15:03.040 --> 15:06.720
I have always had it.
I work with popes.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.560
Are you mad at me ?

15:15.960 --> 15:17.160
I couldn't.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.200
You're just
a Sunday morning Christian.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.080
What does that mean ?

15:23.560 --> 15:26.840
Ready to do good only if you don't
have to get your hands dirty.

15:27.960 --> 15:31.000
You're like those philanthropists
who think they'll go to heaven

15:31.080 --> 15:34.080
if they give away a tiny fraction
of their dirty money.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.760
- You are being unfair. I tried.
- No, you didn't try, Ester.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.760
You just deluded some people
who are truly suffering.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.320
When will I see you again ?

15:56.640 --> 15:58.880
Happy birthday to you !

16:05.760 --> 16:09.520
I need the convent of St. Therese
to be monitored,

16:09.600 --> 16:11.520
with particular focus
on Sister Lisette.

16:14.360 --> 16:17.840
Here I am, Holy Father.
Forgive me for being a little late,

16:17.920 --> 16:22.040
but the Napoli coach's press conference
dragged on and on.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.880
Brevity of speech
is not his strong point.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.680
You Voiello have the great gift
of informing me

16:31.920 --> 16:34.560
of things that would not interesting me
even if I were you.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.920
So, what is this about the nuns
occupying the Sistine Chapel ?

16:42.160 --> 16:46.600
Every six months or so,
the sisters remember that somewhere,

16:47.120 --> 16:50.720
in some parallel universe,
they, too, could say mass.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.160
But don't worry,
I have the situation under control.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.840
Don't be too hard on them, Voiello.

16:57.920 --> 17:02.400
The proper amount, that way
they will not be too hard on me.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.960
Marilyn Manson
doesn't know who I am.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.920
Marilyn Manson
doesn't know who he is.

17:10.560 --> 17:15.599
The Church I have in mind
must be better at informing people.

17:16.359 --> 17:20.839
Every Marilyn in the world should
know reflexively who the pope is.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.200
This is not vanity,
this is necessity.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.800
As for them knowing who they are,
there's always time for that.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.400
Emory Kitsworth
wants to interview you.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.000
An in-depth,
wide-ranging conversation.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.480
Exclusive coverage
on the Times web site, live,

17:36.720 --> 17:41.080
then rebroadcast, an hour later,
on every TV channel in the world.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.360
So, now every Marilyn in the world
will know you.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.120
An appealing idea.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.640
I have another one.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.000
I wish to pay a visit to Pius XIII.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.600
- Dutiful.
- Dangerous.

18:04.440 --> 18:08.240
To have two popes,
Pius XIII and John Paul III,

18:08.320 --> 18:12.680
together in one photograph, wouldn't
do much to clear up the confusion.

18:13.120 --> 18:19.040
That photograph will never be taken.
My visit to Pius XIII will be private.

18:20.120 --> 18:24.680
My face will only be seen in public
on my way to and from the hospital.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.760
In storytelling,
that is called "powerful deference".

18:30.880 --> 18:34.680
My admiration for well-read women
will never fade.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.640
Perhaps that's why
I don't miss Megan.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.200
Is there any possibility
he could wake up ?

20:32.400 --> 20:35.880
Based on the knowledge
we have now, no. No possibility.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.200
His hand was so warm !
I found that comforting.

20:47.640 --> 20:51.760
He is still alive,
even though he doesn't know it.

22:57.040 --> 23:02.000
In Venice, my authority
did not turn into authoritativeness.

23:02.560 --> 23:06.320
If I may, Your Holiness,
it is actually the opposite.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.120
Your authoritativeness
did not turn into authority.

23:10.320 --> 23:13.720
- What should I have done ?
- Never mingle with idolaters.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.440
Had you asked my advice,
that is what I would have told you.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.880
What do you think, Sofia ?

23:22.200 --> 23:24.520
You cannot please everyone,
Holy Father.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.880
If I do not please,
I cannot seduce.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.320
If I do not seduce,
I cannot influence.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.920
If I do not influence,
I repent.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.520
- Of what ?
- Of everything.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.160
- Do I please you ?
- Immensely.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.000
May I ask you
an indiscreet question ?

23:50.080 --> 23:55.280
I will never tell you what the woman
whispered in my ear, Eminence.

23:59.800 --> 24:00.880
Appointments !

24:01.480 --> 24:05.720
Our dear Sofia, reconfirmed
as Director of Communications.

24:06.520 --> 24:10.800
The masterful Voiello,
reconfirmed as Secretary of State.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.360
Gutierrez will be my advisor.

24:14.080 --> 24:19.120
And now, an innovation !
My new personal secretary,

24:19.440 --> 24:25.720
in charge of creativity:
the most eminent Cardinal Spalletta.

24:28.480 --> 24:33.000
- What would you have me to do ?
- Everything I do not wish to do.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.400
Which I can assure you,
will be rather a lot.

24:37.280 --> 24:41.360
In terms of creativity,
what do you propose Spalletta ?

24:42.360 --> 24:46.200
I would commission Christo
to make a gigantic contemporary cross,

24:46.320 --> 24:48.160
to be exhibited
in Saint Peter's square.

24:51.560 --> 24:57.240
A classic extemporary operation,
Holy Father, and also quite costly.

24:57.360 --> 25:00.880
Nor is it devoid of the age,
old stench of corruption.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.280
So not a good idea.

25:04.600 --> 25:05.600
Spalletta ?

25:08.840 --> 25:11.200
A momentous diplomatic visit
to North Korea ?

25:12.320 --> 25:13.800
That's already been done.

25:14.120 --> 25:18.520
I would be the second and I have been
playing second fiddle my whole life.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.400
So not a good idea, Spalletta.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.760
A smashing success, Spalletta.

25:24.880 --> 25:29.800
And now I will instruct
my personal secretary in private.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.840
- Disappointed ?
- No. Not in the least, Holy Father.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.800
I won't deny that I had aspired
to become Secretary of State,

25:49.880 --> 25:53.680
but personal secretary
allows me to work closely with you,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.360
which is what really matters.

26:00.160 --> 26:04.560
I am only thinking of your own good,
Holy Father,

26:05.560 --> 26:08.640
for your good coincides
with the good of the Church.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.640
So, Francis II's death.
What do you make of it ?

26:18.520 --> 26:21.160
Did he really die
of natural causes ?

26:26.720 --> 26:28.880
Do you really want to know
what I think ?

26:33.120 --> 26:34.240
Probably not.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.800
Voiello probably had a hand in it.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.960
So we share the same suspicion.
What do you say we look into it ?

26:46.320 --> 26:52.000
Just to keep us from getting bored, and
to keep me from meeting the same fate.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.720
May I offer you some impartial advice,
Holy Father ?

26:57.880 --> 26:59.000
Of course.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.800
I would let it drop.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.960
I will not deny
my longstanding antipathy for Voiello,

27:15.800 --> 27:19.400
yet I feel I must warn you
that making enquiries about him

27:19.520 --> 27:22.040
would mean setting yourself
against him,

27:24.080 --> 27:27.280
which is the last thing you want to do
here in the Vatican.

27:28.520 --> 27:33.440
- Even the walls know that.
- What makes him so dangerous ?

27:35.680 --> 27:39.200
No one really knows.
But the fact is,

27:40.560 --> 27:45.520
every time someone tries to oppose him,
he has ended up in pieces.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.800
Literally.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.200
Literally.

27:54.520 --> 27:58.760
Voiello is helped by the Lord,
Holy Father.

28:00.520 --> 28:04.120
But what is difficult
to understand is:

28:06.080 --> 28:07.400
who is this lord ?

28:11.240 --> 28:12.800
Is he divine ?

28:15.600 --> 28:17.360
Or is he Human ?

28:20.640 --> 28:24.040
Power and mortal sin
are the same thing, Girolamo.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.400
I've always known that.

28:29.360 --> 28:32.200
The others arrive all bright
and dewy-eyed

28:32.440 --> 28:36.040
and delude themselves
they can break this indissoluble bond.

28:38.080 --> 28:41.840
It's a bond that God has established,
without telling anyone.

28:43.760 --> 28:48.920
I've seen so many who've tried,
they've all gone out of fashion.

28:50.880 --> 28:55.760
Only I never go out of fashion,
like Kinder chocolate bars.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.520
What do you think
about this Napoli lineup ?

29:01.960 --> 29:05.920
In terms of their acquisitions strategy
they could have done more.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.360
Don't you think ?

29:11.400 --> 29:12.560
But we'll see.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.120
John !

30:05.040 --> 30:06.080
Sir John,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.320
what did that woman in Venice
say to you ?

30:17.480 --> 30:22.520
How did you prevent the nuns' strike
from leaking to the press ?

30:32.480 --> 30:36.360
Four well-placed surveillance cameras,
a discreet stills camera

30:36.440 --> 30:39.800
and someone tailing them
have yielded interesting results.

30:41.280 --> 30:45.000
Sister Judith and Sister Angela
engage in sexual relations,

30:45.240 --> 30:47.120
with fetishistic perversions.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.840
Sister Melanie is a kleptomaniac,

30:50.440 --> 30:53.200
Sister Valeria, Sister Hasanati,
Sister Penelope

30:53.440 --> 30:56.480
harass and sexually abuse
young Sister Ivanka.

30:58.240 --> 31:02.680
Young Sister Caterina meets up
in a gardener's shed to kiss a boy.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.840
The abbess is worried about
something she has under a breast,

31:06.920 --> 31:08.480
she doesn't sleep at night.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.800
Sister Lisette
is the protest leader

31:11.920 --> 31:14.800
and uses social media
to mobilize nuns outside.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.640
For now that is all.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.640
I'm learning so much
from this silence of yours...

31:29.040 --> 31:30.160
So very much.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.760
Good day, sisters.
You wanted to see me ?

31:34.240 --> 31:37.280
Actually, we wanted to see you
five hours ago.

31:37.880 --> 31:42.560
Forgive me for having kept you waiting.
The consequences of the strike.

31:43.120 --> 31:47.720
Everything is moving more slowly now.
So, what can I do for you ?

31:48.040 --> 31:52.760
- To start: fix the wi-fi.
- If only I could !

31:52.960 --> 31:56.960
But the server is down,
that happens occasionally,

31:57.360 --> 32:02.480
and a nun usually repairs it,
but that nun is currently on strike.

32:03.080 --> 32:06.760
Are you saying we have to suspend
our strike if we want internet ?

32:07.200 --> 32:08.760
It would seem that I am.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.880
Why don't you call in
an outside technician ?

32:11.960 --> 32:15.040
Because here in the Vatican,
we don't like waste,

32:15.360 --> 32:18.560
and because we can live just fine
without wi-fi.

32:19.480 --> 32:23.800
We are the oldest institution
in the world, Sister Lisette,

32:24.160 --> 32:25.720
not the Apple campus.

32:28.800 --> 32:32.320
Reverend Mother, you seem tired.
So am I.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.400
I'm not sleeping well.
Are you ?

32:36.960 --> 32:40.280
Try this. Chamomile.
It helps, I've found.

32:49.520 --> 32:53.360
If we suspend our strike,
what will you give us in exchange ?

32:54.600 --> 32:55.600
Wi-fi.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.840
And our other demands,
what about them ?

32:59.680 --> 33:02.480
I will bring them
to the Holy Father's attention.

33:02.760 --> 33:07.120
As I do with every request
that comes across my desk.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.840
Do not overestimate my power,
Sister Lisette.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.880
I am merely a paper pusher.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.240
We would like to meet
with the Holy Father ourselves.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.560
- To explain our position.
- A sacrosanct right.

33:23.880 --> 33:27.040
You merely need to file
an official request to see him.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.240
- Filed with whom ?
- With me.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.280
Don't touch them.
They're for God.

34:41.080 --> 34:45.360
I am confused. What exactly
is the purpose for this meeting,

34:45.880 --> 34:50.199
which you have defined as both
urgent and highly confidential ?

34:51.080 --> 34:53.280
We are repealing
the "eight per thousand" law.

34:59.120 --> 35:02.560
The tax the Italian people pay
to maintain the clergy.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.120
This is a declaration
of war on the Church.

35:06.680 --> 35:12.080
No, it is a necessary step
toward saving the Italian people.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.640
How ?

35:13.800 --> 35:20.720
Our finances are in incredible disarray.
The EU won't grant us any relief.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.040
A surmountable problem.
I will talk with the EU.

35:25.320 --> 35:30.000
We were elected on the basis of a clear
and simple platform:

35:30.560 --> 35:32.000
to do away with privilege.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.600
Which is exactly
what we have done.

35:36.360 --> 35:41.120
We put the Church at the bottom
of the list, but now your time is up.

35:44.480 --> 35:49.320
I see. So, the issue is not
my confusion but your conviction.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.880
- I take that as a compliment.
- Take it as a threat.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.400
Your conviction
conveys a distinct lack of respect

36:00.560 --> 36:05.080
for the only thing that matters to us
here in the Vatican.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.840
- And what is that ?
- Mystery.

36:12.720 --> 36:16.120
If they go through it,
it will be the end of us.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.880
The Church will be poor.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.800
What do you advise we do,
Holy Father ?

36:28.680 --> 36:32.840
Nothing. As the great
Cardinal Newman used to say:

36:33.360 --> 36:35.440
"Christian virtues are poetic.

36:36.520 --> 36:40.680
Gentleness and grace, compassion,
joy, and modesty.

36:41.840 --> 36:46.400
Where is common,
coarse sentiments are rhetorical tools.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.640
Anger and indignation, emulation,
a combative spirit,

36:51.560 --> 36:53.160
the love of independence."

36:53.880 --> 36:55.360
We must fly high.

36:56.800 --> 37:01.760
We should hold on to the poetry,
and leave the rhetoric to others.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.320
Holy Father,
with all due respect,

37:06.960 --> 37:09.880
I am afraid that Newman
may not be enough.

37:10.680 --> 37:14.840
What a shame, Eminence.
What a shame !

37:16.960 --> 37:21.240
The world once again confirms
it has no use for poetry.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.400
But I am not the world.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.680
That is not me.

37:31.880 --> 37:32.960
You are back.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.600
Yes Ester, I came back.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.640
To test your righteousness.

37:51.920 --> 37:54.040
It's a bluff,
election propaganda.

37:54.360 --> 37:57.200
You may frighten the Pope,
who is a holy man, but not me.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.800
If you repeal
the "eight per thousand" tax law,

37:59.880 --> 38:02.360
you'll make a paltry billion euro
for your coffers.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.800
What can you develop with that ?
Nothing.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.640
In exchange you'll alienate Catholics.
What's this really about ?

38:12.880 --> 38:17.120
Should I be afraid ?
How often have I played this game...

38:17.760 --> 38:22.120
I'd show the folder and on it
I'd write: private life of Cardinal...

38:22.960 --> 38:25.520
They'd be panic-stricken
and do whatever I wanted.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.000
Sometimes,
I didn't put anything in the folder,

38:28.080 --> 38:32.760
or I put 50 copies
of the Napoli game schedule.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.360
- I'm listening.
- No more backroom deals.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.520
Politics have changed,
the only one who hasn't noticed is you.

38:46.200 --> 38:50.600
You keep putting forward procedures
that are old, obsolete and dishonest.

38:51.800 --> 38:55.280
- Are you telling me I'm old ?
- I wouldn't dream of it.

38:57.480 --> 39:01.240
I'm simply saying
that you're outdated.

39:02.640 --> 39:06.200
I should have stayed home,
to loll about my own house,

39:06.320 --> 39:09.240
rather having to loll about
in someone else's.

39:11.640 --> 39:15.920
This is your house. And I will
make it more comfortable for you.

39:18.760 --> 39:23.240
Listen: I can convince
the Minister of the Economy

39:24.360 --> 39:25.640
to delay the measure.

39:26.560 --> 39:32.840
Delay it until the government falls,
but which point we will be safe.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.600
Holy Father, the eight per thousand

39:37.040 --> 39:40.080
is not the only source
of the money Guicciardini needs.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.240
- It can be found elsewhere.
- Where ?

39:44.120 --> 39:49.640
In our own backyard:
we have our own financial organization.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.960
Which is free and easy:
I gather ?

39:56.760 --> 40:00.160
See, Holy Father, you can be concrete
when you want to be.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.440
Don't alter my nature.
It might kill me.

40:05.160 --> 40:09.400
So give me a free hand. I will continue
to deal with the stench of the body.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.400
And you with the perfume
of the spirit.

40:13.560 --> 40:18.720
An admirable poetic utterance,
Eminence. What must I do ?

40:19.760 --> 40:23.040
Tomas Altbruck's.
Sofia Dubois' husband.

40:25.440 --> 40:29.600
Appoint him
head of our financial organization.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.720
It would appear
we are outdated, my dear.

40:49.920 --> 40:54.000
You and I are the same,
we're prehistoric.

40:55.680 --> 40:59.560
Thank you, Holy Father,
for receiving me at this late hour.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.960
I shall always have time for you,
Gutierrez. You are dear to my heart.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.640
I am ready
to hear your confession.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.440
Freddie was dressed nicely tonight.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.160
When we were in the hallway,
he took out his keys.

41:27.240 --> 41:32.280
And, with the calmness of youth,
he opened the door to his room.

41:33.320 --> 41:37.760
But first he turned
and looked at me...

41:43.560 --> 41:45.080
Once inside,
he knew what to do.

41:47.800 --> 41:51.240
I didn't, though.
His confidence excited me.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.360
He got undressed
in front of the mirror...

42:00.400 --> 42:05.280
He wasn't looking at me.
But he knew I was looking at him.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.880
His back. His bare back...

42:19.640 --> 42:20.800
It was too much.

42:22.200 --> 42:26.120
I could barely bring myself
to look at it, it excited me so...

42:27.600 --> 42:29.480
But at the same time,
I wanted more.

42:34.760 --> 42:40.680
And it was as if there
was a wall between us.

42:47.960 --> 42:49.960
But it wasn't an obstacle,
that wall.

42:50.880 --> 42:57.360
- Please, that's enough.
- Yes, enough. Holy Father, enough.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.320
Freddie satisfied my body.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.880
God satisfies my spirit.

43:07.760 --> 43:12.600
So why do I always feel so empty ?

43:12.960 --> 43:17.960
But you are not alone, my friend.
That is all I can say to you.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.360
This constant sense
of feeling inadequate...

43:22.440 --> 43:25.080
Makes us constantly nervous.
I know.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.080
I absolve you of all your sins.

43:32.160 --> 43:34.640
But now you will have to hear
my confession.

43:46.240 --> 43:50.680
In order to stroke my pride,
soothe my insecurities,

43:51.160 --> 43:55.080
satisfy my vanity,
and salvage my limping papacy,

43:57.880 --> 44:00.080
I have taken the first step

44:01.560 --> 44:05.280
in the everlasting garden of sin.

44:07.360 --> 44:12.960
And coward that I am,
I pretend not to see,

44:14.720 --> 44:18.440
not to understand,
not to know.

44:20.240 --> 44:23.960
But I do see, I do understand.

44:27.440 --> 44:28.680
I know.
