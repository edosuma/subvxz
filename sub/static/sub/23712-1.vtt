00:55.943 --> 00:58.679
We are never very far
from those we hate.

01:00.681 --> 01:02.982
For this very reason,

01:02.984 --> 01:06.220
we shall never be truly close
to those we love.

01:08.155 --> 01:11.123
An appalling fact.

01:11.125 --> 01:14.259
I knew it well enough
when I embarked.

01:14.261 --> 01:16.798
But some truths
deserve our attention.

01:18.298 --> 01:20.935
Others are best left alone.

01:23.637 --> 01:26.240
We set sail 67 days ago.

01:27.941 --> 01:30.979
September, 1914.

01:57.405 --> 02:02.711
Matches are useless as teats
on a bull above deck.

02:08.315 --> 02:09.717
Thank you.

02:13.988 --> 02:17.825
There's your island.
Look, you see it?

02:27.200 --> 02:29.103
What are you running from?

02:32.840 --> 02:34.873
That was the first question
they asked me

02:34.875 --> 02:36.678
when I decided to go to sea.

02:38.912 --> 02:41.915
Prepare to weigh anchor!

02:56.062 --> 02:59.731
That is a one man job.
Don't need two.

02:59.733 --> 03:01.033
Rusky, aren't you listening?

03:01.035 --> 03:02.834
Be careful with those
in the back!

03:02.836 --> 03:06.041
Don't get 'em wet!

03:07.775 --> 03:12.344
Careful with that.
Don't throw stuff about.

03:12.346 --> 03:18.053
Get that rope in! Rope!
Are you listening to me?

03:34.467 --> 03:37.903
Come on, come on!
Put him on the rope!

03:37.905 --> 03:39.374
Move it!

03:44.144 --> 03:45.810
No birds.

03:45.812 --> 03:49.116
No weather official
to greet you, either.

04:33.059 --> 04:35.326
Captain, sir,
where we leave the luggage

04:35.328 --> 04:36.929
of officer of air and winds?

04:36.931 --> 04:38.831
Here inside.

04:38.833 --> 04:41.499
Tell the others to hold off
with the rest of the provisions.

04:41.501 --> 04:43.235
No.
No, bring it forth.

04:43.237 --> 04:45.237
With respect,
I am responsible

04:45.239 --> 04:48.607
for your safe passage,
and this is hardly reassuring.

04:48.609 --> 04:50.945
And you've already provided
such passage.

05:06.059 --> 05:08.160
It had to be taken
as an act of kindness

05:08.162 --> 05:11.196
that the captain accompanied me
onto dry land.

05:11.198 --> 05:15.033
Nothing obliged him,
but during the journey,

05:15.035 --> 05:16.968
we had come to one of those
understandings

05:16.970 --> 05:20.240
that sometimes arise between
men of different generations.

05:21.975 --> 05:24.076
The captain
always treated me

05:24.078 --> 05:26.280
with the courtesy
of an executioner.

05:28.082 --> 05:32.153
If he could do anything
for me... he would.

05:43.097 --> 05:46.301
Boys?
Go back to the boat.

06:23.237 --> 06:26.241
You in there!
Open up!

06:34.547 --> 06:36.316
Can you hear me?!

06:40.688 --> 06:42.523
Hello!

07:16.523 --> 07:17.991
Hello?

07:41.515 --> 07:44.085
Hey! Wake up.

07:46.587 --> 07:49.720
Fetch water toad.

07:49.722 --> 07:53.759
Wake up!
Maritime signal technician.

07:53.761 --> 07:57.396
We are replacing the weather
official, Aldor Vigeland.

07:57.398 --> 07:59.366
Can you tell me
of his whereabouts?

08:06.073 --> 08:09.443
I said where is
the weather official?

08:13.047 --> 08:15.614
Listen here, I'm captain
of a ship in transit.

08:15.616 --> 08:18.115
I had to change course
to bring this man here

08:18.117 --> 08:20.785
and take his predecessor away.

08:20.787 --> 08:23.457
- Now where is...
- Typhus.

08:25.058 --> 08:28.593
- He's dead?
- Do you have any tobacco?

08:28.595 --> 08:30.261
Vodka?

08:30.263 --> 08:33.530
Where are the man's remains?

08:33.533 --> 08:36.037
Christ, man, speak up!

08:40.139 --> 08:42.808
He went out one day.
I never saw him again.

08:42.809 --> 08:47.212
For God's sake, it's an island!
How far could he have gone?

08:47.214 --> 08:48.447
A swim?

08:48.449 --> 08:50.685
Your name?

08:54.088 --> 08:55.687
Gruner.

08:55.689 --> 08:57.823
You like Frazer?

08:57.825 --> 09:00.294
That's not my book.

09:01.295 --> 09:03.495
You, you have tobacco?

09:03.497 --> 09:05.366
Not on my person, no.

09:06.767 --> 09:08.632
Ah.

09:10.104 --> 09:12.706
Mr. Gruner.

09:28.888 --> 09:30.390
Captain.

09:31.725 --> 09:33.391
I appreciate your concern,

09:33.393 --> 09:35.430
but I'm not about
to turn back now.

09:37.697 --> 09:38.832
Take this.

09:40.533 --> 09:43.568
Don't mistake stubbornness
with stupidity.

09:43.570 --> 09:47.407
I'll manage.
Thank you for all you've done.

09:50.576 --> 09:53.844
Eat well.
Work hard.

09:53.846 --> 09:55.449
Stay busy.

09:59.452 --> 10:00.519
Fair winds.

10:00.521 --> 10:03.524
And following seas.

10:21.675 --> 10:25.676
I would have to live
in a solitude-like exile

10:25.678 --> 10:29.514
for 12 months
far from civilization

10:29.516 --> 10:32.383
with a job as monotonous
as it was insignificant...

10:32.385 --> 10:35.322
to log the intensity
and direction of the winds.

15:13.499 --> 15:15.666
Mr. Gruner?

15:22.075 --> 15:23.710
Mr. Gruner?

15:25.644 --> 15:26.877
Mr. Gruner, if this is your idea
of an initi...

18:20.352 --> 18:22.121
Open the door!

18:26.892 --> 18:28.294
Let me in!

18:33.933 --> 18:35.135
Gruner?!

18:37.036 --> 18:38.705
Gruner!

18:42.876 --> 18:44.311
Gruner!

18:50.750 --> 18:52.282
Please let me in!

18:52.284 --> 18:53.987
Should've stayed on the boat

18:55.921 --> 18:57.357
Gruner!

19:06.232 --> 19:07.801
Gruner!

19:17.476 --> 19:20.278
When I have fears
that I may cease to be,

19:20.280 --> 19:24.115
before my pen has gleaned
my teeming brain,

19:24.117 --> 19:26.951
before high-piled books,
in charactery

19:26.953 --> 19:30.120
hold like rich garners
the full ripened grain,

19:30.122 --> 19:33.124
when I behold
upon the night's starred face

19:33.126 --> 19:36.359
huge cloudy symbols
of a high romance

19:36.361 --> 19:39.163
and think that I may never
live to trace their shadows

19:39.165 --> 19:41.765
with the magic hand of chance,

19:41.767 --> 19:44.969
and when I feel,
fair creature of an hour,

19:44.971 --> 19:47.070
that I shall never look
upon thee more,

19:47.072 --> 19:49.307
Never have relish
in the faery power

19:49.309 --> 19:51.242
of unreflecting love,

19:51.244 --> 19:55.512
then on the shore of
the wide world I stand alone,

19:55.514 --> 19:59.786
and think till love and fame
to nothingness do sink.

20:55.007 --> 20:56.476
Mother of God.

26:11.623 --> 26:13.890
No! Don't shoot!

26:13.892 --> 26:15.494
Put your gun down!

26:19.365 --> 26:20.534
Put it down!

26:29.675 --> 26:30.844
Step back.

26:32.611 --> 26:34.246
Step back!

26:37.582 --> 26:38.715
What do you want?

26:38.717 --> 26:40.753
Do I really need
to spell it out?

26:44.423 --> 26:45.923
You said you have tobacco?

26:45.925 --> 26:47.892
Yes.

26:47.894 --> 26:50.627
- Coffee?
- Yes.

26:50.629 --> 26:54.798
- Vodka?
- Gin. And ammunition.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.503
Caliber?

27:04.243 --> 27:05.712
There's plenty more.

27:08.747 --> 27:11.848
- She's harmless.
- Harmless?

27:11.850 --> 27:14.186
Come here.
Come here,

27:16.688 --> 27:18.257
Come on.

27:19.926 --> 27:22.492
Good girl, easy.
Good.

27:22.494 --> 27:24.531
See?

27:27.600 --> 27:30.704
I think I'll call you...
Friend.

27:48.788 --> 27:50.421
You got bit?

27:50.423 --> 27:51.558
Burned.

27:53.225 --> 27:55.695
- How many'd you kill?
- Don't know.

27:58.397 --> 28:01.999
The previous weather official.
It wasn't typhus.

28:02.001 --> 28:05.501
You left him stranded here
like me.

28:05.503 --> 28:07.771
It's as good as murder.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.576
We gotta go.

28:21.419 --> 28:22.688
Come on!

28:53.019 --> 28:54.554
Pain gone?

28:56.656 --> 28:59.792
- How long was I out for?
- Day or two by my reckoning.

29:01.494 --> 29:02.829
Pissed your pants.

29:17.076 --> 29:19.643
1,862.

29:19.645 --> 29:22.482
Now that's what I call
an armory.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.916
What's it doing?

29:26.918 --> 29:30.724
Stupid thing.
Thinks stuff'll float away.

29:33.458 --> 29:35.425
You can speak with the beasts.

29:35.427 --> 29:36.963
Not speak, command.

29:39.831 --> 29:41.498
Doesn't it try and escape?

29:41.500 --> 29:44.335
Does a dog leave even
the cruelest of masters?

29:44.337 --> 29:47.538
It's incredible.

29:47.540 --> 29:50.574
I never even imagined
such things could exist.

29:50.576 --> 29:52.443
What we know is a small island

29:52.445 --> 29:54.513
in the vast ocean
of what we don't.

30:00.086 --> 30:02.051
I've heard that there
are atolls that contain

30:02.053 --> 30:03.953
unique and endemic species
of fish

30:03.955 --> 30:06.089
that have evolved
completely independently.

30:07.859 --> 30:11.028
Hangover species that have
survived in isolation,

30:11.030 --> 30:14.000
stuck in a kind
of evolutionary stalemate.

30:16.702 --> 30:18.402
Maybe these beasts
are like that,

30:18.404 --> 30:23.810
not quite human nor amphibian,
reptile or fish.

30:25.144 --> 30:27.881
She's not quite like
the others, is she?

30:30.049 --> 30:32.715
This one doesn't bite,
that's all.

30:32.717 --> 30:35.452
What about that scar
on your shoulder?

30:35.454 --> 30:37.087
There was one time.

30:37.089 --> 30:39.525
The only time.
She learned her lesson.

30:41.860 --> 30:44.994
Remember, it's the still
and silent sea

30:44.996 --> 30:46.699
that drowns a man.

30:53.638 --> 30:56.973
I adjusted the mechanism
to sweep the coastline.

30:56.975 --> 31:00.877
All I know is that the toads,
like all infernal beasts,

31:00.879 --> 31:04.114
they shun light,
human or divine.

31:04.116 --> 31:06.416
Demons from Atlantis.

31:06.418 --> 31:08.786
I believe in what I see.

31:08.788 --> 31:11.155
One thing I still can't
understand

31:11.157 --> 31:13.690
is that you could have escaped
four days ago on the boat

31:13.692 --> 31:16.126
- that brought me here.
- Escape? To where?

31:16.128 --> 31:17.860
To a civilized world.

31:17.862 --> 31:22.065
Nice place,
that civilized world of yours.

31:22.067 --> 31:23.770
That why you gave it up?

31:25.670 --> 31:28.105
Here I'm master
of my own destiny,

31:28.107 --> 31:30.174
- come hell or high water.
- Well, you can keep it.

31:30.176 --> 31:32.909
I'm signaling the first ship
that passes by.

31:32.911 --> 31:36.646
Really? This island is not on
any commercial shipping lanes.

31:36.648 --> 31:38.182
The next ship here will be
the one with your replacement.

31:38.184 --> 31:40.017
Come on, Gruner,
lighthouses are built

31:40.019 --> 31:41.684
- where there's naval transit.
- They're also built

31:41.686 --> 31:44.221
to balance navy budgets
and siphon funds.

31:44.223 --> 31:48.427
Gotta empty a bucket before
you can fill it up again, boy.

31:53.498 --> 31:57.436
It is the second time in a
week I'm forced to rebuild my life.

31:59.003 --> 32:02.572
All my belongings are burned.

32:02.574 --> 32:04.910
I've nothing from the person
I used to be.

32:06.145 --> 32:08.578
In this remote part
of the world,

32:08.580 --> 32:11.048
I feel a sense
of irreparable loss.

32:11.050 --> 32:15.918
I can't tell whether it arises
from a longing for civilization,

32:15.920 --> 32:19.255
a prisoner's panic...

32:19.257 --> 32:20.759
or simply fear.

33:12.645 --> 33:14.912
Don't!
Don't eat that.

33:14.914 --> 33:17.517
It's... it's not edi...

33:20.084 --> 33:21.854
It's a can...

33:24.255 --> 33:26.525
Friend, get your rifle.

33:58.089 --> 33:59.956
Don't shoot till
they reach the tower,

33:59.958 --> 34:01.925
and don't waste bullets
on their wounded.

34:01.927 --> 34:04.230
Give them enough carrion,
they'll devour each other.

34:26.085 --> 34:28.117
I don't see anything.

34:28.119 --> 34:30.353
You'll learn
what to look for.

34:58.884 --> 35:00.217
Come on!

35:00.219 --> 35:03.085
Come on!

35:03.087 --> 35:05.154
Shoot, man! Use your gun!

35:12.264 --> 35:13.900
Come on, shoot!

36:18.297 --> 36:20.797
No man is an island.

36:20.799 --> 36:26.869
Horse shit.
Gruner is an island.

36:26.871 --> 36:30.507
Gruner does not need
any dead weight,

36:30.509 --> 36:36.148
no matter how much chocolate
and coffee ladybird brought!

36:41.319 --> 36:44.256
Go fetch some water.

38:11.944 --> 38:13.311
One last chance.

39:13.205 --> 39:16.375
Hold. Hold fast.

39:18.342 --> 39:21.578
Wait. Hold.

39:23.147 --> 39:24.382
Steady.

39:31.156 --> 39:34.590
Behind you!
Wake up, man! Wake up!

39:34.592 --> 39:39.462
Shoot! Shoot, dammit! Shoot!
Shoot! One last chance!

39:52.210 --> 39:55.378
Gruner,
wait, don't! Gruner!

39:57.214 --> 39:59.616
Gruner! Help!

39:59.618 --> 40:03.520
Gruner!
Gruner, let me in!

40:03.522 --> 40:06.188
Gruner!

41:45.523 --> 41:47.424
Gruner and I settled into

41:47.426 --> 41:52.462
a curious sort of co-existence
based on routine.

41:52.464 --> 41:55.398
The monsters always swarm
at night,

41:55.400 --> 41:59.201
their strikes growing longer
every day.

41:59.203 --> 42:01.570
The Japanese
philosopher Musashi said

42:01.572 --> 42:05.407
that only a few
appreciate the art of war.

42:05.409 --> 42:08.677
A good warrior is not defined by
the cause he defends

42:08.679 --> 42:11.449
but rather by the meaning
that derives from the struggle.

42:13.384 --> 42:15.784
Days are always the same.

42:15.786 --> 42:17.719
I abandon my post
on the balcony

42:17.721 --> 42:19.355
at the break of dawn.

42:19.357 --> 42:22.625
Nature dictates
the length of my slumber.

42:22.627 --> 42:25.427
I have to accept the most
ungrateful tasks

42:25.429 --> 42:28.299
simply to keep my place
inside the lighthouse.

42:29.868 --> 42:31.800
I've been meditating
on my reason

42:31.802 --> 42:33.205
for coming to this island.

42:36.208 --> 42:38.677
I had been seeking peace
through nothingness.

42:39.777 --> 42:42.277
But in place of silence,

42:42.279 --> 42:44.749
I found a monster-plagued
inferno.

42:48.853 --> 42:50.686
Smells strange.

42:50.688 --> 42:52.654
How do you know that
the herbs aren't bad?

42:52.656 --> 42:55.491
Herbs are like people.
They are neither good or bad.

42:55.493 --> 42:57.460
They're just known or unknown,
that's all.

42:57.462 --> 43:00.230
Herbs won't slit
your throat for money.

43:00.232 --> 43:02.831
A farmer keeps cows.
He cares for them.

43:02.833 --> 43:07.302
He feeds them.
He gives them endearing names.

43:07.304 --> 43:08.640
Like Daisy.

43:11.208 --> 43:13.311
But then he steals her milk.

43:15.212 --> 43:16.846
And he kills her children.

43:16.848 --> 43:18.882
Another riddle.

43:18.884 --> 43:20.849
It's a question
of necessity.

43:20.851 --> 43:23.219
Has it ever occurred to you
that it might be her wailing

43:23.221 --> 43:24.623
that attracts the beasts?

43:27.359 --> 43:30.192
But then why would they attack
some nights and not others?

43:30.194 --> 43:33.163
And why would she lure her
own kin to die on the rocks?

43:33.165 --> 43:35.297
The only thing you need
to understand

43:35.299 --> 43:39.268
is that we are the invaders,
which makes us the enemy.

43:39.270 --> 43:42.838
Kill and conquer,
that's what we humans do.

43:42.840 --> 43:45.507
You want to conquer them.
Is that it?

43:45.509 --> 43:47.879
Oh, no,
I want to exterminate them.

43:58.223 --> 43:59.558
We need more timber.

44:02.226 --> 44:03.793
Why?

44:03.795 --> 44:05.865
We haven't been attacked
in weeks.

44:07.866 --> 44:09.902
You like sleeping
in my lighthouse.

44:19.511 --> 44:21.413
Faded.

44:22.647 --> 44:24.183
Far away.

44:26.650 --> 44:28.353
Dissolved.

44:34.292 --> 44:35.627
And quite forgotten.

44:56.248 --> 45:00.817
My eyes have scrutinized
every surface a thousand times.

45:00.819 --> 45:03.353
We speak of the lighthouse
and its environs

45:03.355 --> 45:06.021
as if it were an entire state.

45:06.023 --> 45:08.194
Every nook
and cranny has a name.

45:09.493 --> 45:11.460
Every rock.

45:11.462 --> 45:12.931
Every stone.

45:19.036 --> 45:21.839
Maybe they migrate,
like the whales in winter.

45:24.808 --> 45:27.409
Or maybe the creatures reason
they can't defeat us.

45:27.411 --> 45:29.411
They're beasts.

45:29.413 --> 45:33.516
They are out there gathering in
numbers for their next attack.

45:33.518 --> 45:35.487
You're on watch.

45:42.993 --> 45:45.395
Although it may seem strange,

45:45.397 --> 45:47.529
the lulls between fighting
are often worse

45:47.531 --> 45:49.400
than the battles themselves.

45:51.435 --> 45:52.735
This void is accompanied

45:52.737 --> 45:55.340
by the mascot's change
in attitude.

46:30.875 --> 46:33.342
How could Gruner lie with one of
the very same monsters

46:33.344 --> 46:35.513
that plague us every night?

46:40.784 --> 46:45.520
How did he manage
to justify the act in defiance

46:45.522 --> 46:48.459
of all the obstacles
set down by civilization?

46:50.728 --> 46:52.297
Set down by nature.

47:08.480 --> 47:11.447
How could he get closer...

47:11.449 --> 47:12.885
and closer...

47:17.121 --> 47:20.525
and not be repelled
by her cold skin?

47:25.929 --> 47:27.765
I have decided
to give her a name.

47:29.534 --> 47:30.903
Aneris.

47:35.639 --> 47:37.442
Down.

48:00.998 --> 48:02.898
When'd we run out of potatoes?

48:02.900 --> 48:04.936
We didn't.
You're drinking 'em.

48:15.513 --> 48:16.848
You play?

48:17.848 --> 48:19.751
What civilized man doesn't?

48:24.788 --> 48:27.190
These beasts really are
a fascinating species.

48:27.192 --> 48:29.192
Take the blood,
for example.

48:29.194 --> 48:32.228
I imagine that it must
share the properties

48:32.230 --> 48:36.098
of some arctic fish containing
a kind of anti-freeze

48:36.100 --> 48:38.934
to help them to survive
in sub-zero conditions.

48:38.936 --> 48:42.070
Have you noticed that they've
got two sets of eyelids?

48:42.072 --> 48:43.773
Now the first,
very much like ours,

48:43.775 --> 48:46.576
but the second
is a transparent membrane

48:46.578 --> 48:48.511
helping them when they dive,
I would imagine.

48:48.513 --> 48:51.713
We could capture specimens,
take them back to Great Britain

48:51.715 --> 48:54.183
or to the United States,
present our discovery,

48:54.185 --> 48:56.585
- and we would be celebrated...
- All right, you got me!

48:56.587 --> 48:59.721
I came down to the asshole
of the world to become famous.

48:59.723 --> 49:01.724
All right? Check!

49:01.726 --> 49:03.494
Now shut up and play.

49:07.965 --> 49:09.201
Check mate.

49:14.505 --> 49:17.572
No, i-it can't be.

49:17.574 --> 49:19.074
I-it j...
it just can't be.

49:19.076 --> 49:21.043
Calm down, Gruner,
it's only a game.

49:21.045 --> 49:23.182
- Kings, pawns.
- It can't be!

49:25.817 --> 49:27.683
We forgot the light!

49:27.685 --> 49:29.221
Galley deck!

50:48.132 --> 50:51.537
I'm out! There's too many!
There's too many!

51:55.866 --> 51:57.668
So what do we know do now?

52:05.043 --> 52:08.213
♪ One starry night ♪

52:09.813 --> 52:14.150
♪ As I lay sleeping ♪

52:14.152 --> 52:17.987
♪ One starry night ♪

52:17.989 --> 52:20.989
♪ As I lay in bed ♪

52:22.125 --> 52:25.695
♪ I dreamed I heard ♪

52:25.697 --> 52:30.299
♪ Wagon wheels creakin' ♪

52:30.301 --> 52:36.842
♪ Molly Ban, a storeen,
come and lay me down ♪

52:39.110 --> 52:41.780
I wh...

52:59.163 --> 53:00.795
Look at us.

53:00.797 --> 53:04.366
We can't survive
another assault like that.

53:04.368 --> 53:09.471
We're running out of supplies.
Running out of ammunition.

53:09.473 --> 53:11.042
Running out of will.

53:58.054 --> 53:59.521
Where are you going?

53:59.523 --> 54:02.426
- Hey! What is it?
- There's a boat!

54:21.978 --> 54:23.348
No!

54:26.183 --> 54:28.116
Gruner knows
how to defend himself.

54:28.118 --> 54:30.219
Gruner rules the world!

54:30.221 --> 54:34.190
Gruner wants what he has
and has only what he wants!

54:39.931 --> 54:42.297
- Ungrateful little bitch!
- No.

54:42.299 --> 54:45.169
- Get out of my way, boy!
- Please, Gruner.

54:58.215 --> 55:01.317
No more people.

55:01.319 --> 55:04.453
I see what you are!

55:04.455 --> 55:08.924
A sad, pathetic failure
of a misanthrope!

55:08.926 --> 55:12.328
You're too afraid
to let your friends leave!

55:12.330 --> 55:15.230
Too afraid
to kill your enemies!

55:15.232 --> 55:18.302
Afraid of having
no one left to hate.

56:31.074 --> 56:32.277
Look.

56:39.083 --> 56:40.351
Look.

56:55.065 --> 56:57.002
What has he done
to you this time?

57:12.583 --> 57:15.619
We call this... a "boat."

57:21.257 --> 57:22.627
You see?

57:40.444 --> 57:41.612
What?

58:51.482 --> 58:53.217
I found a rowboat.

58:54.618 --> 58:56.617
I know of it.

58:56.619 --> 59:00.322
Sorry, what?
Why didn't you say so?

59:00.324 --> 59:02.123
Wouldn't do you no good.

59:02.125 --> 59:03.625
I'm sure you'll make it
off my island.

59:03.627 --> 59:06.795
Then you'd be taken by
hypothermia, starvation,

59:06.797 --> 59:10.766
a storm, most likely end up
as toad food, but, hey,

59:10.768 --> 59:13.405
who am I to deny you the right
to choose how you die?

59:15.639 --> 59:18.440
- Where'd it come from?
- Belonged to some Portuguese.

59:18.442 --> 59:20.541
- Shipwreck?
- Tremendous storm.

59:20.543 --> 59:22.444
Came to grief in the night.

59:22.446 --> 59:24.579
And I'm sure you did everything
you could to save them.

59:24.581 --> 59:27.148
I did what I could.

59:27.150 --> 59:29.217
Those that made it ashore
were set upon

59:29.219 --> 59:31.453
trying to reach
the lighthouse.

59:31.455 --> 59:33.255
Nothing left of them
by the morning.

59:33.257 --> 59:35.424
Dragged back down
to the depths.

59:35.426 --> 59:38.226
What were they doing so far
from commercial routes?

59:38.228 --> 59:41.130
It was an illegal ship.
Dynamite smugglers.

59:41.132 --> 59:44.433
Found some crates
washed up ashore.

59:44.435 --> 59:46.603
No good though,
all waterlogged.

01:00:01.217 --> 01:00:04.820
You want to dive that ship.

01:00:04.822 --> 01:00:07.755
We recover the dynamite,
repair the rowboat,

01:00:07.757 --> 01:00:11.692
head out in the morning
at low tide when it's safest.

01:00:11.694 --> 01:00:13.561
You're an idiot.

01:00:13.563 --> 01:00:15.898
What is it about blowing up
a thousand toads you don't like?

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.900
Suicide mission, I'm not
going down in that water.

01:00:17.902 --> 01:00:19.404
Scared?

01:00:23.273 --> 01:00:24.706
I'll do it.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:27.241
All I require from you
is to pump my air.

01:00:27.243 --> 01:00:28.911
Won't work.

01:00:28.913 --> 01:00:30.746
I'm talking
about toad extermination.

01:00:30.748 --> 01:00:32.350
No!

01:02:23.527 --> 01:02:25.761
I changed my mind.

01:02:25.763 --> 01:02:27.699
We leave right away.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.829
Remember,
one tug on the rope,

01:03:00.831 --> 01:03:03.665
everything's fine,
two, load is secured.

01:03:03.667 --> 01:03:04.902
Three....

01:03:07.503 --> 01:03:09.440
Three,
row for your life.

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:26.988
The second line's too close
to the lighthouse.

01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:28.657
At this distance,

01:08:28.658 --> 01:08:31.059
the toads will be packed in
nice and tight,

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.060
like a can of sardines.

01:08:33.062 --> 01:08:36.299
We'll end up perched
on the leaning tower of Pisa.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.354
The Austral summer
is fading timidly

01:09:01.357 --> 01:09:02.859
but with grandeur.

01:09:04.794 --> 01:09:08.064
Now we are inexorably
heading toward the winter.

01:09:10.066 --> 01:09:12.002
Or rather, the darkness.

01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:22.212
Time is a relative idea.

01:09:23.879 --> 01:09:26.247
Drops suspended
from a spider web

01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:29.484
for centuries
before it falls.

01:09:29.486 --> 01:09:32.051
Sometimes, however,

01:09:32.054 --> 01:09:34.792
a week passes
in the blink of an eye.

01:11:16.959 --> 01:11:18.828
Come inside.

01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:59.868
Three weeks.
Three weeks and nothing.

01:12:28.632 --> 01:12:31.399
- We can't eat that garbage!
- Gruner.

01:12:31.401 --> 01:12:33.600
She told them.
You told your friends, huh?

01:12:33.602 --> 01:12:35.903
You warned them, didn't you?
Huh?!

01:12:35.905 --> 01:12:40.207
You fucking little toad spy.
This is how you repay me, huh?

01:12:40.209 --> 01:12:41.643
- You ungrateful, bitch!
- Gruner!

01:12:41.645 --> 01:12:43.978
How dare you leave me?!
Dare you leave me!

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:45.979
- Gruner...
- Try it! Try it again!

01:12:49.552 --> 01:12:51.653
We ambush them.

01:12:51.655 --> 01:12:53.921
We leave the main door open
and lure them inside.

01:12:53.923 --> 01:12:55.590
You pick them off
from the stairs.

01:12:55.592 --> 01:12:58.429
I operate the detonator
once they're close enough.

01:14:22.312 --> 01:14:25.212
Gruner, Babel's open.

01:14:25.214 --> 01:14:27.583
- Lanterns!
- Burning.

01:15:45.294 --> 01:15:49.130
Come on,
come on, sing! Come on!

01:15:49.132 --> 01:15:53.501
Come on! Come on! Sing!
Sing! Sing for your supper!

01:15:53.503 --> 01:15:55.802
Sing! Sing!

01:15:55.804 --> 01:15:57.704
Sing! Sing!
There you go!

01:16:53.262 --> 01:16:57.133
Sing! Sing! Come on!

01:18:04.234 --> 01:18:05.802
They're in!

01:18:11.807 --> 01:18:13.476
They're here!

01:18:28.391 --> 01:18:29.860
It's not working!

01:18:32.829 --> 01:18:34.364
The contact!

01:19:05.661 --> 01:19:06.862
Get down!

01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:17.441
No, Gruner...

01:20:18.034 --> 01:20:19.469
Gruner.

01:20:21.137 --> 01:20:25.741
Gruner, can you hear me?
Gruner.

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:41.921
Under the wide
and starry sky...

01:20:41.923 --> 01:20:44.627
dig my grave
and let me lie.

01:20:45.762 --> 01:20:49.497
Glad did I live
and gladly die.

01:20:49.499 --> 01:20:52.336
And I laid me down with a will.

01:21:41.517 --> 01:21:44.054
Use your knife.
Don't waste ammunition.

01:21:58.767 --> 01:22:00.636
Look at what we've done.

01:22:50.585 --> 01:22:52.755
She'll do that for a time.

01:22:54.656 --> 01:22:56.692
Wail away like that.

01:22:59.529 --> 01:23:02.296
That's how I found her.

01:23:02.298 --> 01:23:06.833
Tangled in a net,
little tyke.

01:23:06.835 --> 01:23:09.472
Cute that way,
aren't they?

01:23:11.307 --> 01:23:13.109
They don't stay that way.

01:23:15.745 --> 01:23:18.144
Cut it free.

01:23:18.146 --> 01:23:20.149
Saved its life, I did.

01:23:25.288 --> 01:23:27.557
It'll come groveling back.

01:23:29.825 --> 01:23:31.958
She always does.

01:23:50.045 --> 01:23:51.815
They're mourning.

01:25:45.428 --> 01:25:47.197
Look at this.

01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:51.165
It's brilliant.

01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:55.836
We have to keep up the pretense.
New, more powerful weapons.

01:25:55.838 --> 01:25:57.706
Putting the fear in them.

01:31:08.017 --> 01:31:11.551
I see you, king of the toads!

01:31:11.553 --> 01:31:14.020
Don't harm them, Gruner.

01:31:14.022 --> 01:31:16.390
A truce is what I think
they want.

01:31:16.392 --> 01:31:19.629
Gruner, put your rifle down.
Show them that you mean no harm.

01:31:23.398 --> 01:31:25.168
We were wrong.

01:31:26.567 --> 01:31:29.304
Gruner, we were wrong.

01:31:37.045 --> 01:31:38.580
Go inside.

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:46.656
I said inside!

01:31:52.694 --> 01:31:54.496
Leave me?

01:31:56.065 --> 01:31:59.232
No one leaves.
No one leaves.

01:31:59.234 --> 01:32:02.836
I leave.
No one leaves Gruner!

01:32:02.838 --> 01:32:05.704
You don't leave.

01:32:05.706 --> 01:32:08.444
You don't leave.
You don't leave.

01:32:10.111 --> 01:32:11.346
No one leaves Gruner!

01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:16.149
Gruner leaves.
Gruner leaves... Gruner...

01:32:16.151 --> 01:32:18.385
you don't leave Gruner, no!

01:32:18.387 --> 01:32:20.487
You don't leave!
Gruner leaves.

01:32:20.489 --> 01:32:24.157
No one leaves Gruner.
No one leave Gruner!

01:32:24.159 --> 01:32:27.030
Gruner leaves.

01:33:15.744 --> 01:33:16.909
Wait.

01:33:44.373 --> 01:33:47.940
Gruner!

01:33:47.942 --> 01:33:51.446
Gruner! Gruner!

01:34:21.642 --> 01:34:24.446
Aldor Vigeland,
you're no murderer!

01:34:51.339 --> 01:34:52.775
Love.

01:34:56.410 --> 01:34:57.746
Love.

01:35:01.717 --> 01:35:03.319
Love.

01:37:04.772 --> 01:37:06.342
Mr. Gruner?

01:37:08.610 --> 01:37:11.714
Maritime signal
technician Gruner.

01:37:14.014 --> 01:37:16.319
All right, get up!

01:37:26.928 --> 01:37:30.729
We are here to replace the
weather official with this man.

01:37:30.731 --> 01:37:32.767
Do you know where he is?

01:37:35.637 --> 01:37:37.373
Speak up!

01:37:40.741 --> 01:37:42.775
Typhus.

01:37:42.777 --> 01:37:46.845
Ugh, this place is a pigsty!

01:37:46.847 --> 01:37:48.614
Look at yourself.

01:37:48.616 --> 01:37:50.716
You are in no fit state
to hold the position

01:37:50.718 --> 01:37:52.051
of signal technician.

01:37:52.053 --> 01:37:55.424
We're at war, man!
Get back here!

01:37:58.959 --> 01:38:02.429
I believe the poor soul
is ill from isolation, sir.

01:38:02.431 --> 01:38:03.896
You know the saying.
No man...

01:38:03.898 --> 01:38:07.602
We'll have him seen to.
Search the island.
