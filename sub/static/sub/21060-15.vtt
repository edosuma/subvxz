00:09.433 --> 00:11.100
-(screaming)
-* Bad boys *

00:11.133 --> 00:12.933
-* Whatcha want,
whatcha want *

00:12.967 --> 00:15.033
* Whatcha gonna do *

00:15.067 --> 00:18.900
-* When the Sheriff John Brown
come for you? *
-Stop! Now! Stop!

00:18.933 --> 00:21.000
-(clattering)
-Heads up!

00:21.033 --> 00:23.500
-* Bad boys, bad boys,
whatcha gonna do... *

00:23.533 --> 00:25.933
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:25.967 --> 00:27.800
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.833 --> 00:29.200
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.233 --> 00:30.433
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.467 --> 00:32.333
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.367 --> 00:34.400
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:40.867
in a court of law.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.167
-I've been
on a street-level narcotics unit

00:45.200 --> 00:46.867
for the past 10 years now.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.733
That's my passion,
weeding out drug offenders
in the community.

00:50.767 --> 00:54.467
What a lot of people
don't realize is that a lot
of the drug offenders out here

00:54.500 --> 00:56.567
are the ones
that are commitin' auto theft

00:56.600 --> 00:59.667
and burglaries.
So I think it definitely
makes a difference

00:59.700 --> 01:03.333
when we're takin'
some of these people
out of the neighborhood.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.467
Uh, we have this car, that,
uh, is leavin' this liquor store

01:06.500 --> 01:09.267
here.
It's got some suspended
license plates,

01:09.300 --> 01:12.933
so we're gonna stop him
and have a chat with him.

01:12.967 --> 01:14.867
-(radio chatter)

01:17.600 --> 01:19.800
-You're good, man.
You can put your hands in.
-How's it goin', guys?

01:19.833 --> 01:21.067
-You got weapons on you
or somethin'?

01:21.067 --> 01:22.200
-No.
-No?

01:22.233 --> 01:23.700
-No weapons in the car
or anything like that.

01:23.733 --> 01:25.133
-Hey, do you know
the plates are suspended?

01:25.167 --> 01:26.600
-It's my ex--
-Your ex-wife's car?

01:26.633 --> 01:28.700
-Yeah.
-Okay.
What's her name?

01:28.733 --> 01:32.400
-My name's Ann.
-Okay. Do you have
your ID on you, real quick?

01:32.433 --> 01:34.633
-I don't have any.
They, um--
-Do you have your ID?

01:34.667 --> 01:36.633
-They were just helpin' me
move my stuff
to my mom's house.

01:36.667 --> 01:37.800
I didn't know
it's expired, either.

01:37.833 --> 01:39.333
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.633
-You have nothing
with your name on it?

01:40.667 --> 01:42.167
-No, I'm movin' all my stuff
to my mom's.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.867
-Give us a minute,
we'll get you outta here,
all right? Yep.

01:46.900 --> 01:50.100
Looks like
the back-seat passenger
has a couple of warrants.

01:50.133 --> 01:53.433
Glendale warrant
is for a trespassing.

01:53.467 --> 01:57.367
Looks like the Peoria warrant
was just a failure to appear.

01:59.733 --> 02:01.833
-Those your crutches?

02:01.867 --> 02:04.400
-He's got a bunch
of warrants.
Is that his crutches?

02:04.433 --> 02:06.900
They are?
-You got a broken foot or what?

02:06.933 --> 02:09.333
-No, ankle.
-Broken ankle?
Let me see.

02:09.367 --> 02:12.567
-You can tell him.
-I'll get with you on my side.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.067
-Did you sprain it or what?
-I got injured, uh...
the back right tire.

02:16.067 --> 02:19.700
-Uh-huh.
-It hit the side of my shoe.
It hit like that.

02:19.733 --> 02:22.200
And he was only going
like four miles an hour.

02:22.233 --> 02:24.167
-You didn't see him, or what?
-No, I did.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.333
-Why didn't you get
outta the way?
-Well, I mean,

02:26.367 --> 02:27.933
I didn't think he would hit me.
(laughs)

02:27.967 --> 02:30.167
-All right.
Come on out here real quick.
You could bring your crutches

02:30.200 --> 02:32.167
with you.
I'm gonna have you
just sit on--

02:32.200 --> 02:34.500
in front of the car.

02:34.533 --> 02:36.933
Nothin' in your pockets, right?

02:36.967 --> 02:40.267
Actually, if you could just
walk back here, just so we
have a little more room.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.800
Just more comfortable for you.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.067
Hey, I'm gonna ask you
a question.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.167
Do you know
the chick in the front seat?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.767
-Yeah, I know her.
-What's her name?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.067
-Toni Ann.
-Huh?

02:48.067 --> 02:49.800
-Toni Ann.
As far as I know.

02:49.833 --> 02:51.833
-What's her last name?
-I don't know it.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.367
-Did you find anything?

02:53.400 --> 02:56.800
-Um, the driver had meth
and weed on him.

02:56.833 --> 02:59.167
The passenger had
methamphetamine in her purse,

02:59.200 --> 03:01.600
and she's got a felony warrant.
-Okay.

03:08.467 --> 03:10.633
-Hey! Hey, hey!

03:11.733 --> 03:14.600
-Roy, you good?

03:14.633 --> 03:16.967
-(radio chatter)
-On the ground!

03:17.067 --> 03:19.433
Get on the ground!
-Get on the ground!

03:25.100 --> 03:27.067
-Get on the ground!

03:27.067 --> 03:29.667
-(sirens wailing)

03:33.500 --> 03:35.267
-Get on the ground!

03:35.300 --> 03:39.233
-(radio chatter)

03:46.767 --> 03:48.300
-See him?
-Huh?

03:48.333 --> 03:50.100
-(radio chatter)

03:50.133 --> 03:51.933
-See him?
-Hey, watch that over there.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.067
-(radio chatter)

03:55.833 --> 03:58.467
-He's gonna be
right in this area.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.333
I'd say maybe a little farther
west, but he jumped--
he jumped here.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.533
-(over bullhorn): This is
the Glendale Police K9 Division!

04:04.567 --> 04:06.533
-(radio chatter)
-Surrender immediately!

04:06.567 --> 04:08.300
-We're gonna wait for the dog.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.867
-(over bullhorn): If you do not
surrender, a police dog will be
used to find you.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.933
The dog will bite you.
-This is the Glendale Police
Department, you're gonna

04:13.967 --> 04:16.133
get bit!
You're surrounded!
Come out with your hands

04:16.167 --> 04:18.800
in the air!

04:18.833 --> 04:22.367
-Black male, blue jeans,
black shirt.
-The only thing we have

04:22.400 --> 04:24.533
is 237 Paul right now.

04:24.567 --> 04:27.067
-(indistinct conversation)

04:29.333 --> 04:31.300
-Hey, did he go
through your house?

04:31.333 --> 04:33.933
-(over radio):
He jumped the wall.
It's gonna be a brown house.

04:36.933 --> 04:38.667
-He's in the back there?

04:38.700 --> 04:41.833
-The dog's in the back,
and he's hiding under
all this, on top.

04:41.867 --> 04:43.533
-Is the dog--
What type of dog is it?

04:43.567 --> 04:45.700
-It's a pit bull,
but he's fenced.

04:45.733 --> 04:47.500
-He can't go near me?
-No, he won't.

04:47.533 --> 04:49.400
-Lemme see your hands.
Lemme see your hands!

04:49.433 --> 04:51.067
Let me see your hands!

04:51.067 --> 04:53.433
Crawl outta there now!
Crawl outta there now!

04:55.167 --> 04:56.700
-Crawl!

04:56.733 --> 04:59.267
-Crawl.
-Crawl!

04:59.300 --> 05:02.300
-Crawl outta there!
-Any sudden movement,
you're gonna get shot.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.533
-Do not-- Do not move!
-Crawl.

05:05.867 --> 05:08.067
-Hello!
-Aah!

05:08.067 --> 05:09.967
-Put your hands
behind your back!

05:10.067 --> 05:12.533
-Put your hands
behind your back!
-(man screaming)

05:12.567 --> 05:15.100
-Quit resisting!
Quit resisting!

05:15.133 --> 05:17.200
-I'm not!
No. I'm not!

05:17.233 --> 05:19.933
(groaning)
I wasn't.

05:19.967 --> 05:21.733
-I got cuffs.
-You got it?

05:21.767 --> 05:24.733
-(groaning)
-Well, get up.

05:24.767 --> 05:27.233
-Get up. Let's go, get up.
-My ankle.

05:27.267 --> 05:29.267
-Your ankle?
You ran from the police, man.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.333
-(groans)
-Oh, you're fine.
If you're running,

05:31.367 --> 05:33.800
you're fine.
-Yeah.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.167
(indistinct conversation)

05:39.200 --> 05:41.733
-Where's your car, Lewis?
-Uh, I'm all the way out here.

05:41.767 --> 05:45.133
-Mysteriously,
his ankle hurts again.
-Weird.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.500
-You live here, yes?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

05:51.533 --> 05:53.067
-With-- With your mom?
-Yeah, yeah.

05:53.067 --> 05:55.400
-It's crazy-- I mean,
it worries me that my mom
is here, you know?

05:55.433 --> 05:57.600
She's by herself,
she's diabetic, you know?

05:57.633 --> 05:59.767
-Yeah, she's
obviously shaken up.
-She's very...

05:59.800 --> 06:02.767
-What, uh-- You do desire
prosecution, correct?

06:02.800 --> 06:05.133
-Definitely, yes.
-Well, we'll go ahead and--
He's gonna be charged

06:05.167 --> 06:07.633
with trespassing.
-Definitely. Okay.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.800
-What's goin' on with you, man?

06:11.833 --> 06:13.933
What did I tell you out there?

06:13.967 --> 06:17.467
-(radio chatter)
-When-- When I first talked
to you, what'd I tell you,

06:17.500 --> 06:19.433
when I was searchin' you?
I told you what?

06:19.467 --> 06:21.667
-That you won't arrest me.
-I was not gonna what?

06:21.700 --> 06:24.467
-Arrest me.
-I was not gonna
arrest you.

06:26.067 --> 06:28.533
You had absolutely
no reason to run.

06:28.567 --> 06:31.067
I already told you I knew
about your misdemeanor warrants,

06:31.067 --> 06:33.167
that I was not gonna take you
to jail for.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.900
-Yeah.
-So what's your deal?

06:35.933 --> 06:38.567
-Because every other cop that
said that, they have anyway.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.067
-That doesn't make
no sense to me.

06:42.067 --> 06:46.333
I was trying to be nice to you,
right? Knowing that you got a--

06:46.367 --> 06:51.067
a mystery ankle that hurts
when it wants to hurt,

06:51.100 --> 06:54.533
but when you wanna run,
it don't hurt.
-I was nervous.

06:54.567 --> 06:56.500
-Is there anything in the car
we need to know about?

06:56.533 --> 06:59.300
I mean, that-- that's
my only guess why you ran.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.167
-I really... don't think so.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.900
-All right, well, here's
the deal, man.

07:02.933 --> 07:06.333
Obviously, you ran from us,
and now you're gonna get charged
with the warrants,

07:06.367 --> 07:08.267
and then depending upon
what we find in the car,

07:08.300 --> 07:10.333
you're probably gonna
get slammed with that, too.

07:12.633 --> 07:16.900
-This last year, I got to join
one of our training teams

07:16.933 --> 07:19.200
for reality based scenarios.

07:19.233 --> 07:22.267
I get to help train new recruits
in domestic violence calls

07:22.300 --> 07:25.267
and car stop training,
where we provide them

07:25.300 --> 07:28.533
as close to the real scenarios
as they can--

07:28.567 --> 07:31.167
will encounter
out on the streets.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.400
We're gettin' ready
to stop, uh, this vehicle.

07:33.433 --> 07:37.500
It's been swervin'
in between the lanes.

07:37.533 --> 07:42.167
I'm going to be 10-45
on a white GMC Sonoma.

07:43.433 --> 07:45.833
-(over radio)

07:51.833 --> 07:53.800
Hello, I'm Officer Vogt
with the Wichita Police
Department.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.367
-How are you doin', sir?
-All right.
Do you have

07:55.400 --> 07:56.867
your driver's license,
proof of insurance?

07:56.900 --> 07:58.467
-Man, it's, uh--
I can give you the number.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.100
-Okay.
Reason I stopped you
is you're weavin'

08:01.133 --> 08:03.067
kinda in between the lanes.
What's goin' on?

08:03.100 --> 08:08.067
Um... I don't know, I...
I don't know, sir, sorry.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.367
I don't-- I didn't mean
to be weavin'.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.900
-Okay, go ahead and turn it off
for me.

08:11.933 --> 08:14.700
Thank you.
All right, do you have
some insurance for the vehicle?

08:14.733 --> 08:18.800
-Uh, I just let my friend
borrow it, though, 'cause I got
a company truck, and, uh--

08:18.833 --> 08:20.700
Can I make a phone call
to my-- to my dad?

08:20.733 --> 08:22.300
-Is the vehicle
in your dad's name
or somethin'?

08:22.333 --> 08:24.733
-Yes, sir.
-All right, if you do find it,
stay in the vehicle for you--

08:24.767 --> 08:27.767
for me, okay, guys?
Don't get out of the vehicle.
I'll be back in a second.

08:27.800 --> 08:32.233
-(over radio): 10-27 is
suspended, and he has
one city bench warrant.

08:32.267 --> 08:38.800
-Hey, um... stopped this car.
There's a male driver
and a female passenger.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.700
It looked like he was trying
to conceal somethin'
that he's sittin' on.

08:41.733 --> 08:44.533
He's got a bench warrant
through us and a suspended DL.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.433
And he's kinda nervous
and fidgety.
-There he is.

08:47.767 --> 08:50.333
-I was gonna tell you
my license is, uh,
in my work truck.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.733
-Okay.
-It's in the shop.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.400
So that's the reason
why I don't have it on me.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.267
Okay. All right. What I'm gonna
have you do, Brandon,

08:55.300 --> 08:58.400
is step out here for me, okay?
Face the vehicle for me?
Step out? Okay?

08:58.433 --> 09:00.700
-What's goin' on, man?
-Put your hands
behind your back.

09:00.733 --> 09:03.500
What happened, dude?
-You just got a bench warrant.
-Bench warrant, man.

09:03.533 --> 09:04.933
-For what?
-That I don't know.

09:04.967 --> 09:06.567
-Can I finish my cigarette,
please? Please?

09:06.600 --> 09:09.067
-When we get this on, okay?
-I can't finish it
with that back there, man.

09:09.067 --> 09:10.667
Please, what do I got
a bench warrant for?

09:10.700 --> 09:12.500
-That I don't know.
-They don't tell--
Through the city.

09:12.533 --> 09:13.667
-Ma'am, do you have
a good license?

09:13.700 --> 09:15.167
-My buddy's been borrowin'
this truck, sir.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.767
-You wanna get her
out the other side?

09:16.800 --> 09:18.967
-Can I please finish my
cigarette? Why are
you grabbin' me like this?

09:19.067 --> 09:20.333
-Partner, step back here.
-I am.

09:20.367 --> 09:22.467
I'm complyin' with you,
but what the hell, dude?
-I know.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.067
Oh, I'm just
gonna be safe, okay?

09:24.067 --> 09:26.467
Lean up against your truck
for me, please.
-What are you doin', man?

09:26.500 --> 09:29.367
-Right now, you're under arrest,
so I've gotta make sure
you don't have anything on you.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.833
-Why are you bein' this way
to me, dude, I know my rights.

09:31.867 --> 09:33.933
-Let's step back here.
-Can I please finish
my cigarette?

09:33.967 --> 09:36.367
-I'll let you take a drag
off of it, all right?
-Please?

09:36.400 --> 09:38.567
-In just a minute
we'll worry about that, okay?

09:38.600 --> 09:40.733
-I think it's out, bud.
-Is it out all the way?

09:40.767 --> 09:43.067
-Yeah.
-All right.

09:43.067 --> 09:45.533
-Dude, I ain't going
nowhere, man.
-Well...

09:45.567 --> 09:49.500
the problem here is, partner,
is you kinda been actin'
nervous and fidgety.

09:49.533 --> 09:51.967
-I'm just--
-And then you're bossin' me
around all the time out here--

09:52.067 --> 09:53.667
-I'm not bossin' you at all.
-Yes, you are.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.667
-I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry.
-You've been tellin' me
what to do.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.933
-Okay? And that's
concerning to me.
That's not normal.

09:57.967 --> 09:59.267
-That's fine. I understand.
-All right?

09:59.300 --> 10:00.633
So I wanna be safe.
-I understand.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.467
-I want you to be safe.
-I totally understand.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.033
-So we gotta go through this,
all right?
-Okay.

10:04.067 --> 10:06.367
-All right.
Step down in here.
-Wait, can I finish my cigarette

10:06.400 --> 10:07.700
in there?
-Yeah, I'll get you a lighter.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.400
-(over radio):
An officer in trouble.

10:09.433 --> 10:11.633
-Well, I don't give
nobody permission
to search that car or nothin',

10:11.667 --> 10:13.333
nothin' like that, so don't be--
-I appreciate it.

10:13.367 --> 10:15.667
-All right, can I make
a phone call, please?
-I just asked for another,

10:15.700 --> 10:17.333
'cause of the time.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.667
-Can I please have a lighter?
-I will get back
to you in just a second,

10:19.700 --> 10:21.533
all right?
-What the (bleep), man?

10:21.567 --> 10:25.200
-(radio chatter)

10:25.233 --> 10:27.433
-When he stood up
and got outta the car,

10:27.467 --> 10:31.933
um, this, uh, pipe,
rolled back, and it was
at the back of the seat here.

10:31.967 --> 10:34.667
It appeared that that
was most likely what
he was trying to conceal.

10:34.700 --> 10:39.133
Uh, right back here
at the, uh, where the seat belts
come through in this old seat,

10:39.167 --> 10:45.167
uh, I've actually just located
a, uh, container-- uh, it has
a, bunch of, uh, little pills

10:45.200 --> 10:47.667
in it with some numbers
on 'em. I'll have to check.

10:47.700 --> 10:52.333
-He said he wants the money
in the visor...
-Okay.

10:52.367 --> 10:55.133
-But he's very upset
that you're searching.

10:55.167 --> 11:00.700
-All right.
Obviously in plain view here
in her purse, got a, uh...

11:00.733 --> 11:02.067
large water bong.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.500
Will you go ahead and 15 her?

11:04.533 --> 11:06.833
Uh, and some open alcohol.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.667
-There's nothing in that,
did you check?

11:09.700 --> 11:11.367
It's not even mine.

11:11.400 --> 11:15.500
He made me put it...
(sobbing)

11:16.967 --> 11:20.533
-She said that he told her
to put that in there.

11:20.567 --> 11:22.900
-Oh, she make that voluntary
statement?
-She did.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.833
-She wants you to ask him
if he did that.
-Okay.

11:25.867 --> 11:27.067
What's she got?

11:27.100 --> 11:29.800
-With that shape and color,
and then with the imprint,

11:29.833 --> 11:33.467
a K and a 9, comes back
as, um, being registered
as oxycodone.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.900
-All right.
Hey, Amanda, right?

11:35.933 --> 11:37.800
-Yes.
-The stuff that was
in your purse,

11:37.833 --> 11:39.100
obviously, let's start there.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.800
-I mean, the alcohol's mine.
-Okay.

11:41.833 --> 11:44.433
-Uh, the green bong is his.
-Okay.

11:44.467 --> 11:46.667
-As soon as we got pulled over,
he asked me to put it
in this purse.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.400
-Okay.
-He said it's never been used.

11:48.433 --> 11:50.533
-Okay.
-I don't know, I just put it
in my purse

11:50.567 --> 11:52.200
like a (bleep) idiot. Huh!
-Okay.

11:52.233 --> 11:55.067
-At this point, for sure,
uh, you're gonna get a citation
for transporting

11:55.067 --> 11:56.867
the open container, okay?

11:56.900 --> 11:59.567
Um, but I've gotta
finish my investigation
before I determine

11:59.600 --> 12:01.567
what I'm gonna do
with that bong, okay?

12:01.600 --> 12:04.633
I'll be back
with you shortly, okay?

12:04.667 --> 12:07.633
Hey, Brandon, I--
I've already told you
I stopped you today

12:07.667 --> 12:10.633
'cause you were drivin' down
both lanes, kinda swervin',

12:10.667 --> 12:11.967
I-- I noticed you were
a little nervous.

12:12.067 --> 12:13.300
Was the because of the warrant?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.300
-I mean, I didn't know
I had a warrant.
-Didn't know

12:15.333 --> 12:17.200
you had a warrant? Okay.
-I don't know. I just--

12:17.233 --> 12:19.267
-To me, it seemed like
maybe you were tryin'
to hide somethin',

12:19.300 --> 12:20.367
the way you were sittin'?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.100
And when you stood up,
there was a pipe

12:22.133 --> 12:23.867
sittin' right there
on your seat.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.767
-A pipe of what kind?
-A glass pipe.

12:25.800 --> 12:30.067
And it's got a broken end.
Looks like a-- um,
a drug pipe.

12:30.067 --> 12:32.267
-So...
-That was seat-- Under me?

12:32.300 --> 12:34.400
-Yeah, right under--
It would've been under
your person.

12:34.433 --> 12:36.967
Was that what you were tryin'
to conceal the whole time?
-No, sir.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.133
-No?
-No.

12:38.167 --> 12:39.600
-Okay.
Do you wanna tell me
what was the deal

12:39.633 --> 12:42.300
with that, uh, bong
that I found in her purse?

12:42.333 --> 12:44.533
-It was, uh, it was brand-new.

12:44.567 --> 12:47.300
-Okay.
-Uh...

12:47.333 --> 12:50.600
I... the only reason
why I had it was--
a-- a tobacco bong.

12:50.633 --> 12:54.067
-Okay.
-Now, what about the, uh,
container with all those,

12:54.100 --> 12:59.200
uh... oxys in 'em,
down there by your, uh,
seat belt buckle?

12:59.233 --> 13:03.367
-Again, sir, like I said,
I don't-- I just got
in that truck and took off.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.767
-So you didn't know anything
about the pills, you don't know
anything other than that bong

13:06.800 --> 13:08.533
that you asked her to hide?
-Yes.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.933
-Okay.
-Um, you're gonna go--
gonna go to jail tonight

13:10.967 --> 13:14.200
for the possession
of the opiates, those pills
that I found,

13:14.233 --> 13:16.400
and then the paraphenalia, okay?

13:16.433 --> 13:18.633
You've also got
a suspended license
and then that warrant.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.800
Slide your feet in for us,
and we'll go up there
and take a look--

13:20.833 --> 13:22.400
-You want me to do
anything for you?

13:22.433 --> 13:25.733
-Can you take my money
and then get me out tomorrow?
-Yes.

13:25.767 --> 13:29.167
-Just release my money
with her and then--
-Okay. We can do that.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.933
-Sorry.
-Me too.

13:33.600 --> 13:37.300
-A few days ago, an individual
contacted one of my undercover

13:37.333 --> 13:38.967
social media profiles.

13:39.067 --> 13:42.500
I created a persona
as a juvenile female.

13:42.533 --> 13:45.800
And he contacted me,
believing that he was talking
to a young girl.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.667
The conversation started
relatively innocently,

13:48.700 --> 13:51.733
uh, but he made it pretty clear
that he was interested

13:51.767 --> 13:53.933
in-- in--
in sexual conversation.

13:53.967 --> 13:57.200
He described himself
as a rough guy.

13:57.233 --> 13:58.800
He enjoys rough sex.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.967
And as a girl pleaser.

14:01.067 --> 14:05.067
He specifically said
that he's very strong
and can be overpowering.

14:05.100 --> 14:08.733
He asked what kind
of sexual activities
I was interested in,

14:08.767 --> 14:12.767
and I indicated to him
that it might be rough sex,

14:12.800 --> 14:14.733
it might be, uh, oral sex.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.500
When I asked him
where specifically we were
gonna have

14:16.533 --> 14:21.300
the sexual activity at,
he very bluntly indicated
that, uh, it would be

14:21.333 --> 14:22.867
in his truck.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.900
I asked him straight out
if he, uh, has any condoms,
and he indicated

14:25.933 --> 14:27.067
that, oh yes, he does.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.367
-So there's no question,
based on the messaging,

14:29.400 --> 14:32.367
that his sole intention
at this point tonight
to meet with you

14:32.400 --> 14:35.167
is for some sort
of sexual act.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.500
-Oh, absoutely.

14:36.533 --> 14:39.267
He asked how old the persona is.

14:39.300 --> 14:43.067
When I answered him
that I was 15, he made
a very important statement,

14:43.100 --> 14:46.367
saying, "But I'll go to jail.
You're not old enough."

14:46.400 --> 14:49.267
He's fully aware of what
he is about to do is wrong.

14:49.300 --> 14:53.067
Unlike any reasonable person,
who would have ended
the conversation at that point,

14:53.067 --> 14:55.967
he's indicating that,
as far as he knows,
we're still doing this.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.200
-Keep us posted
on where you're at,
and make sure

14:58.233 --> 15:00.233
he's following through,
and I'll go get the troops
in place.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.633
-Yep. We'll do that.
-All right. Perfect. Thanks.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.200
Man, you make
one ugly girl.

15:09.233 --> 15:10.467
-What do you think?
-All right.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.767
We're gonna get over here
and get into place.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.867
Uh, we've got
a good location to set up
here at the meet place,

15:16.900 --> 15:18.967
and, uh, then we'll
be ready to go.

15:19.067 --> 15:22.467
So here we are,
and we'll get set up,
and hopefully he'll show up,

15:22.500 --> 15:23.967
and we can take him to jail.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.600
All right, how are you
gonna be sittin'?

15:32.633 --> 15:35.233
Let's just make
we've got your pose perfect
as he's pullin' up?

15:35.267 --> 15:36.867
-Just like this, so I have
an advantage.

15:36.900 --> 15:39.167
Then I'm gonna say,
"Hey, Detective Cox,
you're under arrest,"

15:39.200 --> 15:41.433
Nye County Sheriff's Office.
-Are you gonna
duck your head, though?

15:41.467 --> 15:43.433
-I'm gonna duck--
Here's how I'm gonna be.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.900
-I'm gonna be just like this.
-Okay, perfect.

15:45.933 --> 15:47.133
-Okay. Cool.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.267
-All right, so he should be
here any second.

15:49.300 --> 15:52.267
-(over radio): Yes.
-All right. We're in place,
ready to go.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.900
He's movin'.

15:57.767 --> 15:59.467
He's pullin' up.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.633
We're gonna be lit up
as soon as he goes.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.967
Cox, we're made, go.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.833
-Nye County Sheriff's Office.
Step outta the truck.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.500
Keep your hands up.

16:10.533 --> 16:12.667
-Step outta the car.
-Step outta the car.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.067
Step out-- here--
here you go.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.467
Come here, yeah.
Come here.
Turn around.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.767
Put your hands behind your back
for me.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.967
-What'd I do?
-Don't move.

16:18.067 --> 16:19.467
-I'm gonna turn off
your car engine, all right?

16:19.500 --> 16:20.833
-Yeah.
-Don't move.

16:23.933 --> 16:25.733
-You're under arrest.
-What'd I do?

16:25.767 --> 16:28.200
-We'll-- We'll talk to you
in just a sec, all right?
-Okay.

16:28.233 --> 16:30.067
-All right, come over here
for me, man.
-Sure.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.533
-Hey, how you doin'?
I'm Detective Cox

16:31.567 --> 16:33.067
with Nye County
Sheriff's Office.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.867
-Yes?
-What are you doin' over here?

16:34.900 --> 16:37.233
-Um, I'm gettin' ready
to go see my friend.

16:37.267 --> 16:40.067
-Okay. I just wanted to tell you
somethin' real quick, though,
you have the right

16:40.067 --> 16:42.100
to remain silent.
Anything you say or do
can be used against you

16:42.133 --> 16:44.367
in a court of law.
You have the right
to the presence of an attorney,

16:44.400 --> 16:46.533
and if you can't afford
an attorney, one will be
appointed for you

16:46.567 --> 16:48.667
before questioning.
Do you understand your rights?
-Yes, sir.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.300
-I'm part of our undercover
operations unit for the Nye
County Sheriff's Office.

16:51.333 --> 16:56.433
-Okay.
-So... I have a hard time
believin' that, you know?

16:56.467 --> 16:58.067
-Okay.
-And-- And I'll tell you why,

16:58.067 --> 17:01.933
is because I met someone today,
and you wanna know what
her name is?

17:01.967 --> 17:03.333
-Sure.
-Her name's Jessica.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.533
-Okay.
-I met her today.

17:04.567 --> 17:06.200
-Okay.
-Okay?

17:06.233 --> 17:10.067
-Who's-- Who's Jessica?
-Well, Jessica's a troubled
15-year-old girl.

17:10.067 --> 17:13.400
-Oh, no.
-And I got her phone.
And you guys had

17:13.433 --> 17:16.667
an interesting conversation.
I knew you were coming
to this location.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.900
-Okay.
-Did you wanna tell me why?

17:18.933 --> 17:20.233
-Yes.
-Okay.

17:20.267 --> 17:22.100
-Let's be honest
with each other.
-So, when I-- when I

17:22.133 --> 17:24.833
found out about that,
I told her the same thing.
I didn't want anything

17:24.867 --> 17:28.200
to do like that.
So, when I found out that
she was on my Facebook,

17:28.233 --> 17:29.667
I was like,
I need to get rid of this.
-Yeah.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.400
-AJ, I'm gonna stop you.
-Yes, sir.

17:31.433 --> 17:34.633
-Okay, I'm gonna stop you.
The cops don't just hang out
in a parkin' lot

17:34.667 --> 17:37.067
with a decoy sitting here.
-It looks bad.
You're absolutely right.

17:37.067 --> 17:39.133
-No, what would
you expect, though?
-I don't know.

17:39.167 --> 17:41.100
Like I said, I've never
been in this situation before.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.133
-AJ, let me tell you
somethin' real quick.
-Yes, sir.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.400
-We know you were comin'.
You need help, and I wanna
help you.

17:45.433 --> 17:47.200
-No, I don't--
I don't wanna do
anything like that.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.633
-Look, look-- AJ.
-So...

17:48.667 --> 17:54.267
-AJ. You know, when you said
that you better like rough sex,

17:54.300 --> 17:58.067
because I'm a rough--
I'm a rough kinda guy...
-Yes. I did say that.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.833
-I'm not lying about anything.
-All right.

17:59.867 --> 18:01.833
-But when I found out
about this whole problem
with that...

18:01.867 --> 18:03.633
-Sure.
-...I told her-- I was gonna
tell her in person,

18:03.667 --> 18:04.833
I was like,
we need to get you help.

18:04.867 --> 18:05.967
-How old did you think she was?

18:06.067 --> 18:07.433
-She had told me
that she was 15.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.867
-Okay, so you came here
to tell her, "You're
a troubled girl.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.133
And I want you
to do the right thing,
and I want you to go home."

18:12.167 --> 18:14.133
-'Cause I-- like I said,
I've never done this
my entire life.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.800
Why would I start now?
-So why today?

18:15.833 --> 18:18.500
-Because, like I said,
if I saw her, I can help her.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.800
There's a 15-year-old girl
on my Facebook.
Why would I have that?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.533
I had no idea.
-What were you
going to do with her?

18:22.567 --> 18:24.400
-Nothing.
-You were going to show up
and do what exactly?

18:24.433 --> 18:25.967
-If she was here,
I can call 9-1-1.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.100
-So why didn't you
call 9-1-1?

18:27.133 --> 18:28.767
-'Cause you came to my truck
real quick.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.667
My phone was underneath
my-- my leg.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.700
I was gettin' ready
to make the phone call.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.433
-That's really a weird story.
-Yeah.

18:34.467 --> 18:37.100
-Why couldn't you help her
without pretending you
were gonna have sex with her?

18:37.133 --> 18:39.833
-Mostly because it's easier
to talk to somebody in person
than it is over Facebook.

18:39.867 --> 18:41.333
-AJ, you got a problem.
-No, I don't.

18:41.367 --> 18:42.867
-Do you have
any condoms on you?
-No.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.400
-Not at all?
-I'm gonna check--

18:44.433 --> 18:46.533
-No-- Yes, I have--
Yes, I do have one condom
with me, but that's

18:46.567 --> 18:47.767
'cause I have sex
with my girlfriend.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.300
Who I've been with
two years this coming April.

18:50.333 --> 18:53.433
-So you have literally
a text message on your phone
that says,

18:53.467 --> 18:56.133
"Are you gonna have sex with me
at your house or in your truck?"

18:56.167 --> 18:57.433
and you--
-Hmm?

18:57.467 --> 18:59.200
-That's on there and you
admit to sayin' that,

18:59.233 --> 19:02.833
and you have one condom
in your pocket.

19:02.867 --> 19:05.600
Wouldn't you agree with me
that this looks kinda bad?

19:05.633 --> 19:07.467
-Yes, sir.
It is absolutely bad.
-Hold on...

19:07.500 --> 19:09.333
do you have anything else
illegal in your truck at all?

19:09.367 --> 19:10.733
-Nope.
-Do you mind
if I search your truck?

19:10.767 --> 19:12.733
-Go ahead.
-Okay. Cool.
I appreciate that.

19:12.767 --> 19:15.400
-We're gonna go over
to this patrol car here.

19:15.433 --> 19:18.333
Other side,
follow the deputy.

19:18.367 --> 19:21.433
You made a bad decision.
Okay? Sex and money,
those are the two things

19:21.467 --> 19:23.067
that destroy human beings.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.633
You're gonna watch your head
gettin' in, AJ.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.700
-Okay.
-And it's not made
for comfort,

19:26.733 --> 19:27.967
so just keep that in mind,
all right?

19:28.067 --> 19:30.633
-Yeah. Okay.
-Um, grab your seat belt,
but listen.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.767
-Yes, sir?
-He's gonna take you to jail.
Just so you realize...

19:32.800 --> 19:35.733
-Mm-hm?
-...whether you did or didn't
have sex, the law says

19:35.767 --> 19:39.833
if you use a computer system
with the intent of luring
someone...

19:39.867 --> 19:42.300
-Yep.
-...okay, for the purpose
of having sex,

19:42.333 --> 19:44.533
that it's a crime, so...
that's where we're at,
all right?

19:44.567 --> 19:45.733
-I understand.
-All righty.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.067
All right,
we'll see you at the jail.

19:47.067 --> 19:49.333
(car door shuts)

19:49.367 --> 19:51.533
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.533 --> 19:54.667
Cover is code three.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.667
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.400 --> 20:06.367
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.100
-(theme music playing)
