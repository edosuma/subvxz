WEBVTT

00:10.320 --> 00:13.020
That's 150 grand less than we agreed on.

00:13.030 --> 00:14.390
I spoke to Rahul.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.610
He needs a couple of weeks
to get the balance.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.839
- Your watch.
- Are you joking?

00:20.840 --> 00:22.209
Pay your bills, shithead.

00:22.210 --> 00:23.780
Adrian's working with Jack.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.299
You should have told me
he was your boyfriend.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.049
Deran Cody. He's got a record.

00:27.050 --> 00:28.780
I know you've been moving shit for Jack.

00:28.790 --> 00:31.590
Yeah, and that is my
business, so back off!

00:32.680 --> 00:34.500
Come on, badass. Get up.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.180
- Hey.
- Can I crash here tonight?

00:38.190 --> 00:40.010
Do you think people can change?

00:42.320 --> 00:44.069
Janine's got an idea for a job.

00:44.070 --> 00:46.779
There's a hippie compound
out in Laguna Beach.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.319
They're sitting on a ton of cash.

00:48.320 --> 00:49.860
Your mother was diagnosed

00:49.870 --> 00:51.409
with an aggressive and
advanced melanoma.

00:51.410 --> 00:53.700
She has... cancer.

00:53.710 --> 00:55.100
What about my brothers?

00:55.110 --> 00:56.560
What are you gonna tell them?

00:56.570 --> 00:58.100
I'm not.

00:58.110 --> 01:00.030
And neither are you.

02:04.970 --> 02:05.970
Here you go.

02:05.980 --> 02:08.289
Thank you, baby.

02:22.140 --> 02:23.850
State Police have got
someone talking to them

02:23.860 --> 02:25.330
about you and your boys.

02:25.340 --> 02:28.579
Who?

02:28.580 --> 02:31.540
Somebody close to your family.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.900
Where did you hear that?

02:34.920 --> 02:35.950
I was The Cove tonight

02:35.960 --> 02:37.510
with some of the guys who
were still on the force.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.950
What do they got?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.810
I don't know. Probably not much yet.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.230
Yet?

02:46.240 --> 02:48.270
What are you waiting for?

02:48.280 --> 02:50.950
You waiting for them to show
up at my door with a warrant?

02:50.960 --> 02:53.030
- Is that what you want, Neal?
- Take it easy.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.370
If I start asking questions,
people are gonna get suspicious.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.880
Not my problem, baby.

03:02.470 --> 03:05.699
I'll find out what I can, okay?

03:05.700 --> 03:07.749
Is there any chance of
this blowing back on me?

03:07.750 --> 03:09.740
Anybody else know about our arrangement?

03:09.750 --> 03:12.280
Any of your boys?

03:12.290 --> 03:15.840
Your deep concern for my welfare
is very touching, Neal.

03:15.850 --> 03:17.340
Come on, Smurf.

03:17.350 --> 03:19.840
I'm giving you the heads-up, aren't I?

03:19.850 --> 03:22.220
I always protect my people, baby.

03:22.230 --> 03:25.180
I'm not your people.

03:25.190 --> 03:27.470
Course you are.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.279
I cooperated.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.699
I'm supposed to be done now.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.100
You're not done until I say you're done.

03:36.110 --> 03:38.790
Next time he calls you, you answer him.

03:41.780 --> 03:45.729
I don't know what you think
I can help you with.

03:45.730 --> 03:47.590
Deran's not involved
in anything illegal.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.110
He... He's a guy who owns a bar.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.000
Deran's mother had him
and his three brothers

03:53.020 --> 03:55.590
pulling robberies for her ever
since they were in junior high.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.310
Well, he hates his mom.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.659
And maybe she did have him
doing stuff as a kid,

03:59.660 --> 04:01.900
but he doesn't want anything
to do with her now.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.880
If that's what he's telling
you, then he's lying.

04:06.150 --> 04:07.460
So, I looked at your sheet...

04:07.470 --> 04:09.690
got a couple of dipshit
offenses as a minor,

04:09.700 --> 04:11.340
and I don't know what
kind of jam you're in

04:11.350 --> 04:12.469
where you're smuggling coke,

04:12.470 --> 04:15.560
but you're not a bad guy, Adrian.

04:15.570 --> 04:18.100
The Codys are dangerous.

04:18.110 --> 04:19.178
They're violent criminals.

04:19.180 --> 04:21.940
Including your boyfriend.

04:21.950 --> 04:23.510
You recognize this guy?

04:24.920 --> 04:28.020
It's Benito Oxcama, they call him "Ox"?

04:28.030 --> 04:31.080
Cops found his body in
a Mexican landfill.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.649
He's been dead awhile.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.680
Ox goes back a ways with Deran.

04:37.690 --> 04:40.450
They spent time together in juvie.

04:40.460 --> 04:43.590
Looks like Ox maybe
outlived his usefulness.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.549
Deran's not who you think he is.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.330
If you ever lie for him,

04:48.340 --> 04:50.750
you ever say he's somewhere he wasn't,

04:50.760 --> 04:52.599
that makes you an accessory...

04:52.600 --> 04:56.350
to assault, robberies, and murders...

04:56.360 --> 04:58.050
all of it.

04:58.060 --> 04:59.500
You can help yourself here...

05:01.220 --> 05:03.790
Just don't wait too long

05:03.800 --> 05:06.510
'cause we're moving on this thing.

05:06.520 --> 05:11.010
We're taking down Jack
Muntean's warehouse today,

05:11.020 --> 05:13.180
make sure you're nowhere near it.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.900
Hey.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.020
Where were you?

05:36.030 --> 05:37.300
I went for a run.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.290
At 6:00 in the morning?

05:44.300 --> 05:46.280
I'm in training.

05:51.390 --> 05:52.910
I thought we were done with this shit.

05:55.610 --> 05:58.340
I went for a run.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.920
That's bullshit.

06:05.230 --> 06:06.800
Are you cheating on me?

06:10.320 --> 06:13.140
Yeah. Yes. I-I'm cheating on you. Um...

06:14.630 --> 06:16.360
I meet an elderly gentleman

06:16.370 --> 06:18.199
under the pier every
morning at 6:00 a.m.,

06:18.200 --> 06:21.150
and I-I got the day started
with a toothless blowie.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.930
I couldn't sleep, alright?

06:29.940 --> 06:32.810
Got the North Shore coming
up in a coupl'a weeks.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.330
I actually have a decent rating now,

06:34.340 --> 06:36.870
so I'm feeling like I
got something to lose.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.610
Okay?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.440
Alright.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.660
I'm gonna go up and shower.

07:02.330 --> 07:04.030
Morning, baby.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.850
Morning.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.510
What happened to your face?

07:08.520 --> 07:13.290
I got sucked punched outside a
club by some drunk asshole.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.120
Did you?

07:15.130 --> 07:18.030
You might want to put
a little aloe on it.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.410
I need you to do something for me, J.

07:21.420 --> 07:23.310
Okay.

07:23.320 --> 07:26.410
Someone is talking to the cops.

07:26.420 --> 07:30.070
Someone very close to us.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.610
Have you boys been cautious?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.750
Who else knew about the Frankie job?

07:35.760 --> 07:37.040
No one, I don't think.

07:37.050 --> 07:42.450
We used to be much more
careful about who we trusted.

07:42.460 --> 07:46.970
Now, I need you to find out who
your uncles are talking to.

07:46.980 --> 07:49.350
And phones. We all need new phones.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.460
Go out, buy a bunch of burners,
and just pass 'em out.

07:52.470 --> 07:55.160
Pope and Angela...

07:55.170 --> 07:57.180
They seem pretty close.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.160
If someone is talking,

08:02.170 --> 08:04.640
you are gonna handle it.

08:04.650 --> 08:08.830
You want to know what it feels
like to be in charge, J?

08:08.840 --> 08:13.850
This is what it feels
like to be in charge.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.790
"Crest"?

09:20.600 --> 09:23.190
You need someone to drive you?

09:23.200 --> 09:25.690
Mnh-mnh.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.980
Aren't you supposed to feel sick after?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.250
Hey, baby.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.650
Want me to fix you some eggs?

09:35.660 --> 09:38.040
Uh, no thank you. I'm good.

09:38.050 --> 09:39.560
I got to go.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.990
It's hard to stay sober in this house.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.330
Can't reach for a can of
soup or a cup of coffee

10:15.340 --> 10:20.610
without coming across an oxy
stash, a fifth of Jack...

10:20.620 --> 10:23.800
Jesus, what happened to you?

10:24.880 --> 10:26.310
I got in a fight.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.960
I'll be fine.

10:28.970 --> 10:31.140
Why are you here?

10:32.760 --> 10:35.890
Needed a place to crash until
I get back on my feet.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.240
And this was the best
place you could think of?

10:39.510 --> 10:41.190
Why are you here?

10:41.200 --> 10:44.350
Your mom lived in poverty to
keep you away from these people.

10:44.360 --> 10:48.980
My mom lived in poverty
because she was a junkie.

10:48.990 --> 10:51.640
But you know all about that, right?

10:51.650 --> 10:54.030
She was an addict.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.690
She was sick.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.990
And I did the best I could to help her.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
And now what?

11:02.010 --> 11:03.540
Are you helping Pope?

11:05.320 --> 11:07.920
Pope and me got history.

11:10.260 --> 11:13.740
Smurf owes you, J.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.010
I came here for you.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.390
You're following her.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.630
Smart.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.900
I don't need your help.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.940
Yeah, you do.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.730
Who else can you trust?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.980
What's up?

11:55.160 --> 11:57.610
So, Smurf wants me to spy on you guys.

11:57.620 --> 12:00.130
She what?

12:00.140 --> 12:03.550
She wants me to look into
who everybody's talking to.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.790
She's thinks we're not keeping
secrets as well as we should.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.950
Why would she think that?

12:08.960 --> 12:12.000
She thinks somebody's
talking to the cops.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.130
What'd she say?

12:15.140 --> 12:19.220
She wants us all to use burner phones.

12:19.230 --> 12:22.630
And she wants me to "handle"
the person that's talking.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.750
She's just playing you.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.810
If she actually thought that there
were someone talking to the cops

12:28.820 --> 12:31.450
she would call us all
together, get us talking,

12:31.460 --> 12:33.070
and probably send us out for blood.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.230
Where is she right now?

12:36.420 --> 12:37.630
At the house.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.650
Yeah, see? How worried
could she actually be?

12:39.660 --> 12:40.870
If she thought there was a threat,

12:40.880 --> 12:43.230
she'd be out asking questions,

12:43.240 --> 12:45.380
talking to her cops, sending
Pope after somebody.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.270
It's all good.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.000
So why did she send me
out for the phones?

12:49.010 --> 12:51.570
I don't know.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.470
Honestly, she's probably pissed that
we pulled that job with Frankie,

12:54.480 --> 12:57.610
and this is some kind of
bullshit, petty revenge.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.080
I don't know.

12:59.090 --> 13:02.190
Just stay clear of her today.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.800
Hand out the phones. Go back tonight,

13:03.810 --> 13:06.590
tell her you talked to everybody
and didn't find anything.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.270
We pulled a job with someone
we know nothing about.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.490
Look, man, how many times
are you gonna let her

13:10.500 --> 13:11.720
pull this shit with you?

13:11.730 --> 13:12.739
This is what she wants.

13:12.740 --> 13:15.030
She wants us to drive ourselves crazy

13:15.040 --> 13:18.850
trying to figure out if
there's actually a threat.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.070
- It's bullshit.
- She's not wrong.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.710
Pulling the job with Frankie was sloppy.

13:23.740 --> 13:26.580
Okay, you want to bring
that up with Craig?

13:33.060 --> 13:34.910
That's what I thought.

13:34.930 --> 13:37.440
If you want to keep chasing
bullshit for Smurf,

13:37.450 --> 13:39.070
that's fine with me.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.120
Hey.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.620
What's going on with you two?

14:43.540 --> 14:46.390
You know, she treats you like shit,

14:46.400 --> 14:48.990
but it's you she comes to
when she needs something.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.970
It's always been that way.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.190
Well, I'm the oldest.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.960
It's more than that.

14:59.810 --> 15:03.850
Do you remember when Scotty Yuhas
pulled Julia's bathing suit off,

15:03.860 --> 15:06.020
wouldn't give it back to her.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.410
She had to run across the whole beach

15:07.420 --> 15:09.330
in front of everybody
just to grab her towel.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.400
You beat the shit out of Scotty.

15:15.410 --> 15:20.040
Julia was furious that it
made things worse for her.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.630
But Scotty never tried
anything like that again.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.100
I got to train.

15:35.860 --> 15:37.490
Sure.

16:06.420 --> 16:09.260
- Yo.
- Yo.

16:09.270 --> 16:11.890
You whipping up some eggs?

16:11.900 --> 16:12.970
Yep.

16:12.980 --> 16:15.440
Well, J's got a burner phone for you.

16:15.450 --> 16:17.430
- A burner, why?
- I don't know.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.010
Uh, Smurf's got him
jumping through hoops

16:19.020 --> 16:21.360
'cause she thinks someone's
talking to the cops about us.

16:21.370 --> 16:22.980
Poor kid.

16:22.990 --> 16:24.380
Uh, you want some coffee?

16:24.390 --> 16:27.180
- Yeah, sure.
- Here.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.160
You haven't heard anything, right?

16:34.170 --> 16:37.570
What, about someone talking to the cops?

16:37.580 --> 16:39.670
No.

16:40.540 --> 16:42.870
Why, you think it's got
something to do with, uh,

16:42.880 --> 16:44.750
that job we pulled with Frankie or what?

16:44.760 --> 16:47.450
Uh, I think Smurf's jerking us around

16:47.460 --> 16:49.550
because we pulled the job with Frankie.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.710
- Okay.
- But I don't know.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.550
You think she'd have the
kid doing all this shit

16:54.560 --> 16:56.020
if she thought it was real?

16:56.030 --> 16:59.200
Yeah, well...

17:00.520 --> 17:02.050
Is someone crashing on the couch?

17:02.060 --> 17:04.230
Yeah, me.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.780
Did you hear about Jack? Hey.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.780
- Hi.
- How are you?

17:11.790 --> 17:14.089
DEA raided Jack's place this morning.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.910
Well, yeah, you surprised?

17:15.920 --> 17:17.869
He's been moving blow and meth overseas.

17:17.880 --> 17:21.000
- His dumb ass got greedy.
- Yeah, and he's no genius.

17:21.010 --> 17:24.180
Oh. More customers for me, though.

17:25.060 --> 17:26.650
- Are those eggs for me?
- Yeah.

17:26.660 --> 17:28.060
Do you mind if I pass today?

17:28.069 --> 17:29.750
My heartburn's just acting up.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.290
- All good.
- Thanks.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.510
See you later.

17:36.780 --> 17:38.980
- Hey, you want eggs?
- Thanks.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.120
It's good to see Renn.

17:44.130 --> 17:47.610
Yeah, she, uh, she
needed a place to crash.

17:47.620 --> 17:48.900
She kept it.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.320
The baby? Yeah.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.950
You want some hot sauce?

17:54.960 --> 17:56.160
It used to be a dairy farm,

17:56.170 --> 17:58.090
but the commune's been there for years.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.340
- They're hippies?
- They're drug dealers.

18:00.350 --> 18:04.610
They preach that no possessions
unity of man bullshit,

18:04.620 --> 18:07.400
but they're about the money.

18:07.410 --> 18:10.750
There's at least 10 grand
around all the time

18:10.760 --> 18:14.150
for when society collapses
from commercial excess,

18:14.160 --> 18:15.510
all that hippie shit.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.670
There's a dirt road

18:17.680 --> 18:20.850
that cuts through the woods
behind the compound.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.860
- That's our way in.
- Mm.

18:25.820 --> 18:27.650
- Thank you...
- Mm-hmm.

18:27.660 --> 18:29.470
... Pam.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.290
You're welcome... mm...

18:32.300 --> 18:34.410
Jake.

18:34.420 --> 18:37.190
You look like a Jake.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.580
Is that a good thing?

18:39.900 --> 18:42.000
Uh-huh.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.430
You wanna pay attention?

18:45.440 --> 18:47.250
- I can do both.
- Security.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.750
- Security?
- Yeah.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.920
Thought this was supposed
to be an easy score.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.660
It will be.

18:52.670 --> 18:55.140
If we're gonna risk
people shooting at us,

18:55.150 --> 18:56.559
we might as well hit another bank

18:56.560 --> 18:57.930
where we know what to expect.

18:57.940 --> 18:59.490
She didn't say there was no security,

18:59.500 --> 19:01.180
she just said it's
nothing we can't handle.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.820
It'll be a little tight.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.820
Alright, are you a...

19:16.830 --> 19:19.450
Are you a hard stick?

19:20.610 --> 19:21.870
Do your veins roll?

19:21.880 --> 19:23.830
- How would I know?
- Hmm.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.820
Ah.

19:25.830 --> 19:28.040
I'll be with you in a sec, Mrs. Morris.

19:28.050 --> 19:30.740
Trexall's a good one,

19:30.750 --> 19:32.880
might make you feel a
little nauseous, though.

19:32.890 --> 19:35.800
So, let me know if you start
to feel dizzy or faint.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.750
It isn't supposed to cause hair loss,

19:39.760 --> 19:42.020
in case you were worrying about that.

19:42.030 --> 19:43.520
I wasn't.

19:48.550 --> 19:50.760
You can relax.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.690
Is that your Jag in the parking lot?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.430
Yes, ma'am.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.080
I can tell, suits you.

20:07.090 --> 20:10.700
I'm stuck with a minivan.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.180
I hate it, but at least it's red.

20:13.190 --> 20:15.010
I've been dying for something new,

20:15.020 --> 20:17.880
but my grandkids need
something they can all fit in.

20:17.890 --> 20:19.820
I have six.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.430
You?

21:37.410 --> 21:39.780
Jack's place got raided.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.350
Is that gonna blow back on you?

21:48.490 --> 21:52.620
I stopped doing runs for him,
so I should be fine, right?

21:52.630 --> 21:54.730
That depends on how long they've
been investigating him,

21:54.740 --> 21:57.100
and if he's willing to make a deal.

21:57.110 --> 21:59.210
Don't they usually arrest
everyone at the same time?

22:05.470 --> 22:07.950
Smurf thinks someone's
talking to the cops.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.920
Really?

22:11.930 --> 22:15.640
She got J running around
passing out burner phones.

22:15.650 --> 22:18.040
Everybody's on high alert right now.

22:18.050 --> 22:19.240
What do you think?

22:19.250 --> 22:22.550
- You think it's true?
- I don't know.

22:26.050 --> 22:28.000
Jack knows we're together.

22:28.010 --> 22:29.260
There's no way that he says anything

22:29.270 --> 22:31.440
that sends Smurf or Pope his way.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.450
Cops have been on him for a long time.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.150
Hey.

22:39.020 --> 22:41.190
Has anybody talked to you?

22:42.950 --> 22:44.750
No.

22:48.230 --> 22:49.980
Just be careful.

22:49.990 --> 22:52.320
Okay.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.050
- I'm serious.
- Yeah.

22:56.390 --> 22:58.120
I'll see you tonight.

23:18.370 --> 23:20.420
Really, Craig?

23:20.430 --> 23:22.350
Wouldn't return my calls.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.270
Figured this way you'd show up.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.110
You screwed me.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.800
I screwed you?

23:28.810 --> 23:30.610
You went behind my back to Smurf.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.820
You stole Rahul's bike and his watch.

23:32.830 --> 23:34.190
What the hell were you thinking?

23:34.200 --> 23:35.200
He owed me money.

23:35.210 --> 23:38.260
Now we're even.

23:38.270 --> 23:40.410
He shorted 150 grand,

23:40.420 --> 23:43.800
so you steal a $200,000 bike
and a million dollar watch?

23:43.810 --> 23:45.780
How is that even?

23:45.790 --> 23:47.320
You know how hard it was

23:47.330 --> 23:50.200
to find a buyer who was
willing to pay more than 30K

23:50.210 --> 23:52.440
for that piece of shit watch?

23:52.450 --> 23:53.760
You sold it already?

23:53.770 --> 23:55.970
Yeah. Bike, too.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.890
Get the watch back.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.390
And how am I supposed to do that?

24:00.400 --> 24:01.940
Figure it out.

24:01.950 --> 24:04.340
You burned an entire network for me.

24:04.350 --> 24:05.869
No one connected to Rahul

24:05.870 --> 24:07.540
- will work with me now.
- Yeah?

24:07.550 --> 24:11.020
Well, now I got Smurf up my ass
about pulling an outside job.

24:11.030 --> 24:13.239
You should never have
kept her in the dark

24:13.240 --> 24:14.870
about the job in the first place.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.300
How do you think that makes me look?

24:16.310 --> 24:17.870
- Who cares?
- I do.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.900
She's your mom, she'll get over it.

24:19.910 --> 24:22.420
I need her to know I'm a professional.

24:22.430 --> 24:23.970
So that's what this is about?

24:25.250 --> 24:27.960
All that talk about how
I'm good at what I do

24:27.970 --> 24:32.430
and how you brought this
to me and not the Codys...

24:32.440 --> 24:35.200
and you were just trying
to get in with Smurf.

24:35.210 --> 24:37.470
That's not all I was trying to do.

24:45.070 --> 24:47.880
I meant what I said about you.

25:01.350 --> 25:04.480
Did I mess up?

25:04.490 --> 25:06.680
You won't even look at me.

25:08.430 --> 25:10.550
Did I say too much before?

25:13.430 --> 25:15.210
No.

25:17.870 --> 25:19.100
Where are you going?

25:21.010 --> 25:22.570
I have a fight.

25:24.430 --> 25:27.270
Can I go with you?

25:27.280 --> 25:30.020
I won't be in the way. I-I promise.

25:56.850 --> 26:01.560
_

26:01.570 --> 26:03.880
We're all being optimistic here, right?

26:03.890 --> 26:05.439
But the reality is

26:05.440 --> 26:07.600
we may not be around forever.

26:07.610 --> 26:10.020
I know I've done my job well.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.879
I wasn't one of those women
who coddled her children,

26:12.880 --> 26:15.520
but they still depend in me, Grandma.

26:15.530 --> 26:20.200
The child care costs are crazy,
and they both need to work.

26:20.210 --> 26:22.990
No way they could survive
without Molly's income, too.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.540
Jeff works at the base.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.840
Long hours, the overtime
is great, though.

26:28.850 --> 26:31.010
How 'bout you, Janine? Any kids?

26:33.480 --> 26:34.770
A-Are you okay?

26:34.780 --> 26:36.520
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

26:36.530 --> 26:39.860
- But you're not done yet.
- You bet your ass I'm done.

27:01.470 --> 27:03.210
I'm gonna take this one, okay?

27:04.670 --> 27:07.000
We're better off with
small arms on this job.

27:07.010 --> 27:08.880
Let the other guys
carry the heavy stuff.

27:08.890 --> 27:10.830
- I can handle it.
- Ain't about that.

27:11.870 --> 27:16.960
Hey, I still don't know exactly
what we're walking into.

27:16.970 --> 27:19.500
I've got faith in your plan.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.050
But if we end up having to haul ass,

27:21.060 --> 27:23.590
I don't want you lugging a gun
that weighs as much as you do.

27:31.340 --> 27:34.080
Here you go. That's you.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.970
Should you still be dealing?

28:20.220 --> 28:22.030
Hey, you know, Jack getting busted

28:22.040 --> 28:25.160
means the DEA's gonna be around.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.570
- Probably a good idea to lay low.
- Unh-unh.

28:29.580 --> 28:33.450
Jack was putting shit on planes
like he's Pablo Escobar.

28:33.460 --> 28:35.790
I've a select group of
customers I sell to.

28:35.800 --> 28:40.090
I know them, they know me.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.070
You realize a kid named Crest

28:45.080 --> 28:48.650
is gonna get the shit kicked
of him at school, right?

28:48.660 --> 28:50.550
That list was supposed to be private.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.650
Well, then you shouldn't leave
it out in the open, then.

28:52.660 --> 28:54.470
Oh, is that where I left it?

28:54.480 --> 28:55.740
Huh.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.850
You know, if you get busted,

28:58.860 --> 29:03.530
you'll be giving birth to
little Colgate in prison.

29:03.540 --> 29:05.750
It's Crest like a wave,

29:05.760 --> 29:08.490
asshole.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.410
You'll need to come up with something

29:10.420 --> 29:12.090
to do for cash when it's born anyway.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.110
I am?

29:13.120 --> 29:15.730
- Right?
- No, really? Like what?

29:15.740 --> 29:19.090
Well, you can't have a kid
toddling around all this shit.

29:19.100 --> 29:22.830
Mm. So, serve cocktails at the Marriott?

29:22.840 --> 29:24.390
This is what I do, Craig.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.850
This is how I make my money.

29:26.860 --> 29:29.980
It's not like I have any other skills.

29:32.780 --> 29:35.290
Okay.

29:55.700 --> 29:56.910
Are we going in?

29:56.920 --> 29:59.760
I don't really want you
to see me like this.

30:03.740 --> 30:07.690
It's... It's gonna be bad.

30:07.700 --> 30:11.610
You mean, like, bloody?

30:11.620 --> 30:13.940
Sometimes.

30:15.060 --> 30:17.720
I can handle a little blood.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.400
You don't scare me.

30:22.410 --> 30:25.700
You're not gonna scare me.

30:29.580 --> 30:31.240
Wait here.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.120
Thanks.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.410
- Can I help you?
- How you doing?

31:00.420 --> 31:03.250
Um, I was supposed to
pick up my grandmother

31:03.260 --> 31:05.830
from her appointment this afternoon.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.110
I left my phone at home.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.020
I was wondering what time she'd be done.

31:09.030 --> 31:11.370
- Sure, what's the name?
- Janine Cody.

31:11.380 --> 31:14.150
Uh, she left already.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.370
She did?

31:15.380 --> 31:17.980
Yeah, she cut her chemo short toady.

31:17.990 --> 31:19.890
Left a few minutes ago.

31:19.900 --> 31:22.550
Uh, maybe she called an Uber.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.580
Yeah. Yeah, she must have.

31:25.520 --> 31:26.870
Okay. Thank you.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.580
You ready?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.840
You ready?

31:46.850 --> 31:48.480
Come on.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.920
Fight!

32:15.230 --> 32:16.780
Alright, he tapped out.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.780
He tapped out.

32:18.790 --> 32:20.490
Come on, get off him.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.920
Come on, get off him! Break!

32:25.680 --> 32:27.310
Alright...

32:58.120 --> 32:59.830
Don't move, fool! Come on!

33:03.600 --> 33:06.990
Stop. Hands, hands.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.830
- Anyone else back there?
- No. Just me.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.440
Come on, asshole! Let's go!

33:10.450 --> 33:11.870
On the ground, get on the ground.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.150
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.930
Eyes down. Go check for others.

33:14.940 --> 33:17.370
Check for others, go. Be careful.

33:17.380 --> 33:18.470
Eyes down.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.250
Go in there. Come on!

33:21.260 --> 33:22.390
Get down there!

33:34.650 --> 33:37.570
- They need you in the other room.
- Be careful.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.740
Remember me?

33:56.030 --> 33:57.880
Open your mouth.

34:01.030 --> 34:03.450
How does it feel to have
something in your mouth?

34:03.460 --> 34:05.330
Hmm?

34:07.180 --> 34:10.330
She had a lot of shit in her mouth.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.900
Alright, that's it. Let's go!

34:18.090 --> 34:19.580
Back up, back up!

34:23.920 --> 34:25.790
Drop it.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.550
Now.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.570
Clear! Back to the van.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.440
We gotta go!

34:33.360 --> 34:34.540
What are you doing?

34:35.540 --> 34:37.469
Ah! Shit!

34:39.110 --> 34:41.000
Let's go.

34:42.719 --> 34:44.370
I did this to you.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.460
- Go! Go now!
- Go, go.

35:02.910 --> 35:05.530
Go get in the shower,
I'll get you some ice.

35:12.140 --> 35:13.840
So where'd she go?

35:14.970 --> 35:16.790
Nowhere interesting...

35:16.800 --> 35:19.620
went to a nail salon then got groceries.

35:23.850 --> 35:26.150
Okay.

35:45.090 --> 35:47.190
Here you go.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.870
She has cancer.

35:57.190 --> 35:59.700
She won't let me tell my brothers.

36:24.110 --> 36:26.100
We're closed.

36:40.150 --> 36:41.870
I said we're closed!

36:45.910 --> 36:48.670
Jack Muntean got busted.

36:52.370 --> 36:54.600
It's not a good time right now.

36:54.610 --> 36:56.940
The cops raided his place today.

36:56.950 --> 36:58.720
Yeah, I heard.

36:58.730 --> 37:00.710
Did your brothers hear?

37:00.720 --> 37:02.470
What about your mom?

37:06.590 --> 37:08.300
Come on.

37:09.920 --> 37:13.470
'Cause you know who didn't get busted?

37:13.480 --> 37:16.310
Your boyfriend.

37:19.510 --> 37:22.010
You got something to say, just say it.

37:22.020 --> 37:25.920
Jack's going away,
Adrian's free and clear.

37:25.930 --> 37:28.300
So either he's working with the cops

37:28.310 --> 37:31.540
or it's easier for someone
to think that he is, right?

37:31.550 --> 37:34.640
Someone like Pope.

37:34.650 --> 37:36.440
What do you think Pope would do

37:36.450 --> 37:38.960
if he found out Adrian
was talking to the cops?

37:46.260 --> 37:48.120
What do you want?

37:48.130 --> 37:50.400
$20,000.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.130
Okay.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.000
And this ends here?

37:57.010 --> 37:59.950
I give you my word.

38:16.740 --> 38:19.470
Sorry it had to go down like this.

38:19.480 --> 38:22.800
I wish we could've pulled some more
jobs like the old days, you know?

38:23.950 --> 38:25.440
But you don't wanna do that.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.440
I gotta eat, too, man.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.730
Hey.

38:44.740 --> 38:46.450
Hey.

38:49.980 --> 38:52.160
So, it's a boy, huh?

38:52.170 --> 38:54.850
What?

38:54.860 --> 38:57.720
Well, Logan...

38:57.730 --> 39:00.850
Max, Ford, Crest...

39:00.860 --> 39:03.300
They're all boys names.

39:06.560 --> 39:07.640
Yeah...

39:09.220 --> 39:10.990
it's a boy.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.460
Got any blow left?

39:17.010 --> 39:19.740
- Why?
- How much?

39:22.020 --> 39:24.180
Some.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.370
I'll take all of it.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.230
What happened?

39:53.240 --> 39:56.330
Smurf heard someone was
talking to the cops.

39:56.340 --> 39:58.430
Him?

39:59.960 --> 40:03.230
I confronted him about it, and
he came at me with a gun.

40:03.240 --> 40:06.180
The cops get anything from him?

40:06.200 --> 40:09.280
No.

40:13.150 --> 40:14.360
Damn it.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.750
Well, we'll put in the board bag.

40:17.760 --> 40:18.770
We'll carry him in my truck.

40:18.780 --> 40:21.250
There's bleach in the cabinet
next to the sink. Get it.

40:21.260 --> 40:22.870
Oh, and we got to get rid of your gun.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.750
Yeah.

40:32.260 --> 40:33.890
His gun, too.

40:43.260 --> 40:45.180
Get the bleach.

40:46.790 --> 40:49.890
I want a name.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.530
I'm working on it.

40:51.540 --> 40:53.430
Work faster.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.860
Well?

41:01.820 --> 41:04.190
Nobody's talking to anyone...

41:04.200 --> 41:05.870
except the one we already know about.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.050
I'll take care of her.

41:08.060 --> 41:11.510
No more mistakes, baby.

41:11.520 --> 41:15.050
We don't have the time.

41:15.060 --> 41:17.000
- Let's do it.
- Come on.

41:17.010 --> 41:18.380
Here we go.

41:18.390 --> 41:20.710
And here it comes.

41:20.720 --> 41:21.830
Oh, shit.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.450
I know, I know, stop crying.

41:23.460 --> 41:24.670
There we go.

41:24.680 --> 41:27.700
Look at that... good as new.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.740
Shit.

41:31.750 --> 41:34.710
That's why he hit banks.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.830
They got guns at banks, too.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.190
Yeah, but it's not their money.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.600
Lot less likely they'd use them.

41:45.260 --> 41:48.060
How much do we usually
make when we hit a bank?

41:49.210 --> 41:50.260
Hmm?

41:51.480 --> 41:53.030
Two or three grand.

41:53.040 --> 41:57.480
We made $8,000 today.

41:59.470 --> 42:02.830
So, I'm gonna call this a success.

42:02.840 --> 42:07.400
Janine, we need to talk.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.630
How deep is supposed to be?

42:22.640 --> 42:25.210
Just dig until you can't
see out of the hole.

42:30.500 --> 42:33.590
This is new for you, right?

42:38.340 --> 42:40.420
It's weird, you know?

42:40.430 --> 42:43.290
I thought I'd feel
something, but I don't.

42:43.300 --> 42:45.860
I don't feel anything.

42:45.870 --> 42:48.900
It's the adrenaline.

42:48.910 --> 42:51.480
You'll feel it tomorrow.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.480
Were you gonna blow
that guy's brains out?

42:55.490 --> 42:57.480
No.

42:59.780 --> 43:04.030
Did you see the look
on his face, though?

43:10.460 --> 43:12.650
Who is he?

43:12.660 --> 43:15.320
A friend of my mom's
from when I was younger.

43:16.900 --> 43:19.460
So it was personal?

43:23.470 --> 43:24.690
Yes.

43:24.700 --> 43:26.730
Hmm.

43:30.020 --> 43:32.260
Jobs can't be personal.

43:33.820 --> 43:36.580
You make 'em that way, shit goes south.

43:40.140 --> 43:42.470
If there's someone you owe a beating...

43:42.480 --> 43:44.490
Or, shit, if there's
someone you need to kill,

43:44.500 --> 43:47.740
just tell me and we'll go do it.

43:49.100 --> 43:51.800
But don't bring it into a job.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.120
We have to trust each other.

43:56.590 --> 43:59.780
You're either in 100% or you're out.

43:59.820 --> 44:03.180
It means you never lie to me again.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.570
I'm in.

44:24.420 --> 44:25.880
You just get home?

44:36.440 --> 44:37.960
Can I join you?

44:40.830 --> 44:42.870
Since when do you have to ask?

45:17.140 --> 45:18.660
I love you.
