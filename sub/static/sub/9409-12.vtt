- He's a plant.
- You're the plant.

17:32.933 --> 17:35.367
No. He's lying.

17:35.367 --> 17:37.567
He's a copy.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.700
He's a plant copy.

17:40.700 --> 17:44.533
One of my experiments
that went wrong.

17:44.533 --> 17:48.533
I put him in there because
he's dangerous. Now spray him.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.633
No. He's the copy.
He's the dangerous one.

17:52.133 --> 17:55.500
He's trying to make plant copies
of us all. Spray him!

17:56.433 --> 17:58.367
I don't know what to do.

17:58.367 --> 18:01.433
Give me that.
Get back, both of you.

18:01.433 --> 18:04.200
Margaret, listen to me.

18:04.633 --> 18:08.567
He'll destroy us all.
He had me locked up.

18:10.367 --> 18:12.833
- But I escaped.
- You're a liar.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.800
He was the one that tried
to feed you the food.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.300
- He attacked Marek.
- No, that's not true.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.667
He has Marek locked up
in the other cupboard.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.767
Don't listen to him.
Attack him now.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.433
Before it's too late.
Destroy him.

18:26.833 --> 18:29.233
Please,

18:29.233 --> 18:31.267
Princess.

18:31.267 --> 18:33.300
Princess!

[ Screaming ]

18:50.167 --> 18:52.167
How did you know?

18:52.167 --> 18:54.167
There's only one person
who calls me Princess--

18:54.167 --> 18:56.100
My real dad.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.800
[ Dr. Marek ] We can study these
better at the university lab.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.800
Oh, by the way,

19:06.300 --> 19:08.300
the board wants to know
when you can come back, full time.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.800
Well, as soon as I get over
all these side-effects.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.300
[ Chuckles ]

19:12.300 --> 19:14.800
Uh, listen. I appreciate everything
that you have done for me.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.800
Oh, and I appreciate you
getting me out of that closet.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.733
Well, you should thank
Margaret and Casey for that.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.833
I still don't understand
how the whole thing started.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.333
[ Exhales ]
Well, it was an accident.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.833
I cut my hand on a slide,

19:32.833 --> 19:35.833
and some of my blood mixed in
with some plant molecules,

19:35.833 --> 19:38.867
and I ended up with something
that was part plant and part human.

19:38.867 --> 19:43.000
- You never told me any of this.
- Yeah, I know. I should have.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.667
But I was wrapped up in my work.
Then I went too far.

19:46.167 --> 19:49.000
I created a plant that was
an exact copy of me.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.633
- [ Margaret ] Except that it was evil.
- Well, to us, yes.

19:52.633 --> 19:56.233
But like most organisms,
it wanted to dominate its environment.

19:56.733 --> 19:57.367
It overpowered me.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.567
I think that it wanted
to make plant copies of us all.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.700
Oh, man!

20:02.700 --> 20:05.200
When Aunt Eleanor was getting better,
she asked me about you two.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.867
I said you were both
growing like weeds.

20:07.367 --> 20:10.600
I never realized how close
to the truth I almost was.

20:11.067 --> 20:14.033
- Well, I'm just glad we're all okay.
- And all human.

20:14.033 --> 20:16.900
- I'll call you tomorrow, Dr. Brewer.
- Okay, thank you.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.400
Okay. Bye.

[ Truck Door Closes ]

20:32.567 --> 20:34.067
Well, listen.
Anybody for lunch?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.067
I got a great mixed salad
and some garden vegetables.

20:37.067 --> 20:39.067
- [ Groaning ]
- No, I'm only kidding.

20:39.067 --> 20:42.333
I got hamburgers for everybody.
Let's go. Let's go!
