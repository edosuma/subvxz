WEBVTT

00:04.308 --> 00:06.180
- They offered you more money,

00:06.223 --> 00:09.052
better hours, but you said no?

00:09.096 --> 00:10.880
- Yeah, I'm happy
where I'm at.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.751
- You're nuts.
- I'm loyal.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.753
- See, now I know you're old.

00:14.797 --> 00:17.756
Come on. Look at this.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.628
Great place
for a sobriety test.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.934
Come on, you're
right in front of our drop-off.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.071
Oh, damn it.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.689
- I'm gonna need you guys
to back up.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.606
- Fifteen minutes, maybe more.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.086
We gotta check all the boxes
on this idiot

00:43.130 --> 00:44.827
before we take him downtown.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.786
But hey, if you guys wanna
unload from here, have at it.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.745
- Thanks.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.101
- Let's go!
- Whoa, guy's got a gun.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.929
- Hands, now.
- Okay, okay!

00:59.972 --> 01:01.452
- Out of the truck!
- Let me see those hands, man!

01:01.496 --> 01:03.150
- Drop the bags!

01:03.193 --> 01:05.195
- Now, get out of the truck!
Move!

01:05.239 --> 01:07.980
- Take it easy!

01:08.024 --> 01:09.199
Easy.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.766
We got this.
Get the money!

01:10.809 --> 01:13.116
- Sit down. Sit down.
Just sit down!

01:13.160 --> 01:14.944
Okay.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.946
Let's go, let's go!

01:19.601 --> 01:21.168
- Come on, hurry up.

01:21.211 --> 01:23.735
- We can take them.
- No, we can't. Just sit still.

01:23.779 --> 01:24.867
- Shut up.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.566
- Come here.

01:28.610 --> 01:29.959
- That's it.
- That's it, that's it!

01:30.002 --> 01:31.700
Let's go!

01:31.743 --> 01:33.136
- Say one more word.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.138
Say one more word,
I'll kill you.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.184
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on!

01:37.227 --> 01:39.011
- Let's go.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.143
Move!

02:01.556 --> 02:03.253
- Two guys driving the armored
truck are over there.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.690
They got tuned up pretty good,
but they're okay.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.039
- That's good to hear.
- Only thing we know so far,

02:07.083 --> 02:09.041
our perps are dressed like
undercover NYPD.

02:09.085 --> 02:11.261
And they had two cars:
Crown Vic and an Audi.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.871
We're checking for
surveillance now.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.699
- No, not yet.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.223
- All right,
I'm gonna take him.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.790
Hi, I'm Special Agent
Maggie Bell.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.184
- Yeah, like I told
the cops--the real cops--

02:21.228 --> 02:22.620
there was three of them.

02:22.664 --> 02:23.752
Two white, one black.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.101
Weight?

02:25.145 --> 02:26.929
- One of the white dudes
was tall and skinny.

02:26.972 --> 02:29.236
The other one and the black guy
were pretty average.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.194
- The guy who came up
to the window, he had a badge?

02:31.238 --> 02:32.891
- Yeah, he looked legit.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.155
- I could definitely ID
one of them.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.157
The dude who was pretending
to be drunk.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.159
Bastard stared right in
my eyes.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.812
Said he was gonna kill me.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.292
- This man have any
distinguishing features

02:42.336 --> 02:43.598
or characteristics?

02:45.600 --> 02:48.733
- Yeah, besides that. Like,
an accent, a tattoo, a scar?

02:48.777 --> 02:50.213
Do you remember anything?
Did he use a name?

02:50.257 --> 02:52.694
A nickname?
- No, no, nothing specific.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.783
I just remember him
getting in my face,

02:54.826 --> 02:57.699
Yelling and screaming,
threatening to kill me.

02:57.742 --> 02:59.918
- We need to get him to
the hospital, run some tests.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.751
- Hold up.

03:06.795 --> 03:10.233
Before you go,
I'm gonna need your shirt...

03:10.277 --> 03:11.974
And your face.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.239
- I'm not gonna lie, people.
I'm a little pumped up here.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.936
Hunting violent bank robbers

03:17.980 --> 03:19.764
is how the Bureau
cut its teeth.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.592
I'm talking Pretty Boy Floyd,

03:21.636 --> 03:23.986
Baby Face Nelson,
and of course the FBI's

03:24.029 --> 03:28.077
very first Public Enemy
Number one, John Dillinger.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.600
- Thanks
for the history lesson.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.211
Now, let's figure out
who's involved.

03:31.254 --> 03:32.255
- Yes, ma'am.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.952
- How the perps knew that

03:33.996 --> 03:35.127
that truck would be at
that place at that time

03:35.171 --> 03:36.607
with that much money in it.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.914
- $2.6 million,
to be exact.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.350
- It was a set route
and set drop time,

03:40.394 --> 03:42.352
so we're thinking they have
somebody on the inside.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.703
- It's possible,
but it seems unlikely.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.227
They were both pistol-whipped.

03:47.270 --> 03:50.012
- Yeah, 2.6 million takes
the sting away pretty quick.

03:50.055 --> 03:52.057
Kristen's got a team
that's vetting everyone

03:52.101 --> 03:54.190
who works at the Five Burroughs
Bank and Conserva.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.888
Hey, let's focus on
the employees with access

03:56.932 --> 03:58.368
to route information,

03:58.412 --> 04:00.370
and let's dig into those
two drivers, as well.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.893
- What about surveillance
footage?

04:01.937 --> 04:05.288
- Ah, OA sent us this
ten minutes ago.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.899
Plates on both cars don't match
the make or model.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.727
- Because they were stolen.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.729
- What about the cars
themselves?

04:11.773 --> 04:13.818
- Uh, checking into that now.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.647
Actually, you know what?

04:16.691 --> 04:17.866
Hold up.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.084
What is this?

04:19.128 --> 04:20.869
- Let's blow this up.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.046
- Looks like a parking decal.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.743
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.223
Get the name of the company
and every employee

04:27.267 --> 04:30.182
that works there
with the same make and model.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.184
- You wanna know
where my car was last night?

04:32.228 --> 04:34.186
- That's correct.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.014
We believe that your car
was used

04:36.058 --> 04:37.668
in an armored car robbery.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.322
- I obviously have nothing
to do with that.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.324
I design eco-friendly
office buildings.

04:41.368 --> 04:44.153
I don't rob banks or trucks.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.765
- I was at the theater
with my wife.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.201
We saw "Dear Evan Hansen."

04:49.245 --> 04:51.160
Then we went out
to a late dinner

04:51.203 --> 04:53.336
and then back to our house
in Brooklyn Heights.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.816
Feel free to run
my credit cards

04:54.859 --> 04:56.339
or check my wife's Instagram.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.820
- Anyone else have access
to your car?

04:58.863 --> 05:01.170
- I'm the only guy in the city
with a black Audi?

05:01.213 --> 05:03.128
- No, but you are the only one

05:03.172 --> 05:06.088
with a Kiriyuchi Design
decal on the windshield.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.003
Literally the only one.

05:10.092 --> 05:13.095
- Is it possible somebody
used it without your consent?

05:14.836 --> 05:16.359
- Sorry, guys. I'm done.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.840
If you wanna keep talking,
you can call my lawyer.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.888
- Jubal, get a tech up
to Brooklyn Heights

05:23.932 --> 05:25.020
and sweep the car.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.457
- Yeah, ran and confirmed.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.067
Jack Salerno was telling
the truth.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.808
He and his wife, Alexandra,
were at the theater,

05:30.852 --> 05:33.855
and then they went to dinner,
paid the tab at 12:01 AM.

05:35.465 --> 05:38.729
- Well, his wife loves selfies
and pictures of food.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.731
Especially fish, but I got
something else.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.733
Something better.
Salerno's brother, Nick.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.039
He's got two priors,

05:44.082 --> 05:46.389
drug distribution
and armed robbery.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.784
And get this: He used to work
at Conserva.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.961
- 12 Chatham Road,
Brooklyn Heights.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.093
Same as Jack Salerno.

05:55.137 --> 05:56.747
- He lives with his brother.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.488
- Means he has access
to the car.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.272
- We're on it.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.449
It's coming your way.

06:02.492 --> 06:05.103
- I was home all night
in my brother's basement.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.933
- Yeah, me.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.331
- We're looking into
an armed robbery.

06:16.245 --> 06:17.507
- Something you have
experience in.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.466
- No, man, that's over.
I did my time.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.206
I work construction now.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.427
- You ever borrow
your brother's car?

06:24.471 --> 06:27.038
What are you talking about?

06:27.082 --> 06:29.780
- It's not a trick question.
Do you ever drive it?

06:29.824 --> 06:32.087
- Yeah, every now and then.
So?

06:34.002 --> 06:35.525
- No, I told you,
I was home all night.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.267
Look, guys, I got nothing
to do with this robbery.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.834
- So, the fact that
your brother's car

06:39.877 --> 06:41.444
was at the crime scene

06:41.488 --> 06:43.968
and that you worked at Conserva
for six months...

06:44.012 --> 06:46.318
What, that's just
a coincidence?

06:46.362 --> 06:47.929
- Guess so.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.848
- Yeah, I really gotta get
back to work.

06:58.548 --> 07:01.856
- No.
Not the lucky ones, anyway.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.512
- Yeah, Nick used to work here.
He's a good guy.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.253
- I didn't fire him.
The boss did.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.561
- Nick wasn't too reliable
or responsible.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.345
And he got caught stealing.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.217
- So, other than that,
he was a damn good employee?

07:15.260 --> 07:17.915
- Let's just say being a good
employee wasn't his thing.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.351
And that doesn't fly
around here.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.963
This whole company is built
on trust.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.226
One transgression
and you're out.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.576
Can't have maintenance workers
stealing things off desks,

07:26.620 --> 07:28.099
out of cars.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.449
- Any way Salerno could have
gotten access

07:29.492 --> 07:31.015
to the route information?

07:31.059 --> 07:32.190
- You mean for
the armored cars?

07:32.234 --> 07:33.931
No, impossible.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.498
That stuff is highly
confidential.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.152
Only a few people
in the whole company

07:37.195 --> 07:38.849
have access to that data.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.372
Wait, are you saying Nick
had something to do with

07:40.416 --> 07:41.939
what happened last night?

07:41.983 --> 07:43.419
- We're not sure.
We're still investigating.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.597
- I'd be surprised.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.381
Nick seemed to be doing
pretty good.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.949
- Yeah, once in a while.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.603
- When was the last time
you spoke to him?

07:53.647 --> 07:56.519
- I don't know,
maybe two, three months ago.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.216
- Okay.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.392
Well, if you think of anything
that might be useful,

08:00.436 --> 08:02.917
let us know.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.528
- Rangers lead the way.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.399
- Nice.
You serve?

08:07.443 --> 08:10.185
- Yeah, two tours in Iraq.
Army Airborne.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.403
- I did three.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.016
Specialist Jason Morgan.
- Captain Omar Zidan.

08:18.019 --> 08:21.196
- Hey, ran the name of every
Conserva employee--

08:21.239 --> 08:22.414
- Mm-hmm.
- They run a tight ship.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.199
Not a prior in sight.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.027
There are barely any speeding
tickets, for God's sake.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.464
- Did a deep dive
on the drivers,

08:28.508 --> 08:30.205
came up empty, and none of them

08:30.248 --> 08:32.163
have any connection to our
lead suspect, Salerno.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.905
- Good news, got a saliva hit
on the driver's face.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.211
Name is Nick Salerno.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.169
- I'm on it.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.084
- Maggie, it's Jubal.

08:40.128 --> 08:42.391
Tell OA he's a baller
for swabbing that guy's face.

08:42.434 --> 08:45.046
We're getting an arrest warrant
for Nick Salerno.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.569
It's coming your way.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.571
Squad will be there
in a half an hour.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.447
- Clear, team right, right!

08:55.491 --> 08:57.101
- Keep it moving,
keep it moving.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.060
- Southwest hallway clear!

08:59.103 --> 09:00.540
- Stack on me!
- Clear left!

09:00.583 --> 09:01.715
- Get a light on it!

09:04.282 --> 09:05.980
- Possible contact left.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.373
- Contact!
- Clear over here.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.029
- Give me a spot on this
right here.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.205
- I'm here.
- I gotcha.

09:14.249 --> 09:17.382
- I got two points of entry
in the rear here.

09:20.037 --> 09:23.650
- We got one male down.
One DB. Repeat, one DB.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.348
- What were you saying
about coincidences?

09:26.391 --> 09:27.697
- Copy that, dispatch.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.569
- Evacuate personnel
and equipment.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.014
- Other than our lead suspect
being dead,

09:40.057 --> 09:41.145
what do we know?

09:41.189 --> 09:42.233
Do we have any leads?
Any witnesses?

09:42.277 --> 09:43.757
- Nothing yet.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.062
- Motive for the murder
is pretty clear:

09:45.106 --> 09:47.151
Ruthless crew tying up
loose ends.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.197
- No honor among thieves.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.068
- Or construction workers.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.682
You know, the only people
who saw us talking

09:55.725 --> 09:57.553
to Salerno were
construction workers.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.903
It's possible that the crew
worked there, too.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.644
You know, maybe they saw us
grilling Salerno,

10:01.688 --> 10:03.037
they got nervous, took him out.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.604
- Okay, look into it.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.214
And keep digging into Conserva.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.782
There has to be an inside
connection somewhere.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.785
- Uh--haven't gotten any
useful video

10:11.828 --> 10:13.221
from the Brooklyn Heights
house,

10:13.264 --> 10:16.050
but we pulled all cameras
facing and adjacent

10:16.093 --> 10:18.182
to the construction site.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.576
This is yesterday around
4:00 PM.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.187
- That's an hour or so
after we talked to the DOA.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.885
Salerno there,
at the construction site.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.147
Can you zoom in,
get a better look?

10:26.190 --> 10:27.278
- Yeah.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.243
- That looks like the guy
that was staring at us.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.723
Remember that?

10:36.766 --> 10:38.202
- And he matches
the general description

10:38.246 --> 10:41.031
of one of the perps:
White, tall, thin.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.033
- His name is Eric Healy.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.035
Got a positive ID
from facial rec.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.602
- Eric Healy.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.083
Has one prior, armed robbery.

10:49.126 --> 10:51.738
No immediate family.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.915
Grew up in foster care.
No formal education.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.615
- Yeah, that's him.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.964
- He was one of the "cops."

11:01.008 --> 11:02.357
Kept barking out orders.

11:03.793 --> 11:04.968
Would you testify to that?

11:05.012 --> 11:06.143
- Damn right I would.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.364
- If Jay says he's the guy,
he's the guy.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.974
Whether I saw him or not.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.760
So yeah, I'd be happy
to testify.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.762
I'd also be willing to take
a bat to his head

11:15.805 --> 11:17.154
if you happen to know
his address.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.852
- We don't.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.114
Probably shouldn't say that
out loud.

11:20.157 --> 11:21.768
Not to us, anyway.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.729
Got a positive ID on Healy.
He's our guy.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.122
Look, I'll get the warrant,
you just find out

11:28.165 --> 11:29.689
where the hell he is.
- You got it.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.952
Tall, thin, white guys
are my specialty.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.649
That didn't sound the way
I meant it.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.738
Bobby, let's put out a BOLO
on Eric Healy.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.218
Male, white, 35.

11:37.261 --> 11:38.828
- Just head an emergency call
coming over the wire

11:38.872 --> 11:40.134
involving a Conserva truck.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.833
- Yeah, we're rolling on
it now.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.100
- Emptied it out.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.928
1.2 million.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.408
- The driver of the truck
took some fire.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.671
He's in bad shape, just left
for the hospital.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.109
- Over there.
She's okay.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.894
Physically, at least.
- Thank you.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.026
Hey, what do we know about
the explosive device?

12:03.070 --> 12:06.377
- IED. Remote detonated.
Planted in the dumpster.

12:06.421 --> 12:09.163
Hole cut to send it on the path
of least resistance.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.730
- Classic chokepoint:

12:10.773 --> 12:12.862
Truck veers to miss the can,
then boom.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.430
- We found a back-up detonator.

12:15.473 --> 12:18.389
It was put on
an old-fashioned timer.

12:18.433 --> 12:21.784
Explodes when the minute hand
hits this pin.

12:21.828 --> 12:26.180
- Looks like it was set
to go off right about now.

12:26.223 --> 12:29.183
Guess they were trying to
destroy any remaining evidence.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.754
- Maggie.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.366
That construction tape could be
a marker which would

12:38.409 --> 12:40.324
tell them when to
hit the detonator.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.856
- There's another one.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.905
- Maggie..

13:00.910 --> 13:03.086
- That could be another bomb.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.871
Everybody move back!
- Everybody stay back.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.307
- Move back.
Get out of here, now.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.048
- Get back.
Everybody back.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.832
- Stay back.
- Move back now.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.225
- Get out of here.
- Everybody get off the street.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.835
- Move back.
Get out.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.054
What are you doing?
Get off the street.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.273
I said, move. Move!

13:25.282 --> 13:26.849
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.764
You're good to go.
- Thank you so much.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.070
- Hey, hold on--are you
kidding me?

13:30.113 --> 13:31.375
Get out of here.
- Get him out of here.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.249
- Okay, I'm gonna go talk
to the driver's partner.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.817
- Okay.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.217
Hi, I'm Special Agent Maggie
Bell. I work for the FBI.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.089
Can you tell me what happened?

13:49.132 --> 13:51.874
- We were headed
for our first drop off

13:51.918 --> 13:56.096
and Ed, my partner, he saw
a garbage can in the road.

13:56.139 --> 13:59.229
He swerved and then
some sort of bomb went off.

13:59.273 --> 14:03.190
The truck flipped over
and...and then I heard gunfire.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.890
- I ducked and I hid and...

14:07.934 --> 14:09.805
I was so scared,

14:09.849 --> 14:12.460
I just started praying.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.984
- Did you happen to see
anyone's face?

14:17.421 --> 14:19.162
Hey, this isn't on you.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.908
- Hey, the IEDs used in
the second robbery,

14:25.952 --> 14:27.301
were made with commercial C4.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.433
- That Healy stole from
Verdanti Construction.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.044
I talked to the Foreman,

14:31.087 --> 14:33.220
Healy wiped out their entire
C4 inventory.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.308
- So, he's not only
in the wind,

14:34.351 --> 14:35.483
but he's loaded with C4.

14:35.526 --> 14:36.919
- And he knows how to use it.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.181
He's a demolition expert.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.270
- Which means he's escalating.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.359
C4 is his domain
and his expertise.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.405
If you take someone like
Healy--uneducated,

14:44.448 --> 14:47.495
troubled upbringing--he loves
to show off his expertise.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.018
Makes him feel powerful
and important.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.977
So you better be careful.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.328
The more pressure he's under,
the more brazen he'll become.

14:54.371 --> 14:57.853
- Guys, I think we found
the other members of the crew.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.463
We've been reviewing
surveillance footage

14:59.507 --> 15:02.075
within a mile-radius
of Healy's old address,

15:02.118 --> 15:03.859
and just found this.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.861
Check out the time stamp,
9:00 AM,

15:05.905 --> 15:07.254
morning of the first robbery.

15:09.082 --> 15:11.127
- So we got Healy, Salerno...

15:11.171 --> 15:12.520
- And that's Ryan Jenkins,

15:12.563 --> 15:14.522
just got a hit off
of facial recognition.

15:14.565 --> 15:17.003
Priors include armed robbery
and assault.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.179
Born and raised in Brooklyn.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.530
- Don't know.
Came up empty.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.186
- Kristen, can you zoom in
on him?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.411
- That's Jason Morgan.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.413
Rangers lead the way.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.513
- Jason's not here.
He took a late lunch.

15:49.557 --> 15:50.862
He needed to run some errands.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.734
What kind of errands
he's running?

15:52.777 --> 15:54.475
What's going on?

15:54.518 --> 15:57.304
- Well, we need to speak
with him about the robberies.

15:57.347 --> 15:58.783
- Great, I'm sure he's dying
to help.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.046
He loves it here.

16:00.089 --> 16:01.786
- I'm not so sure
about that, sir.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.397
We think he might be the one
supplying the crew

16:03.440 --> 16:04.659
with the route information.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.443
No, impossible.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.011
He's a freaking war hero,
for God's sake.

16:09.055 --> 16:12.058
Purple Heart, Bronze Star
for Valor, all that.

16:12.101 --> 16:15.539
Kid has like, 12 confirmed
kills over in Iraq.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.541
He's not perfect,
but he's a good kid.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.065
- What do you mean
"not perfect"?

16:19.108 --> 16:20.936
- You know, he drinks a little
too much.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.416
Maybe self-medicating,
I don't know.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.026
I'm not a shrink.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.507
He had a positive drug test
a few months back.

16:27.725 --> 16:30.511
- Pot and cocaine.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.730
But it's not like he's a driver
or a brain surgeon.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.602
He oversees the facilities.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.604
- So, there's no chance
that he has any access

16:36.647 --> 16:37.997
to the route information?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.955
- No, like I said,
he's the facilities guy.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.871
- Does he have access to any
of the people who have access?

16:45.395 --> 16:47.745
Or does he socialize
with any of them?

16:47.789 --> 16:51.401
- He's dating Kate Valdez.
She's VP of Logistics.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.539
She oversees the routes
and the pickups.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.977
- If Jason comes back here,
we need to know immediately.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.761
- Yeah, hold up.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.763
He should be out front.

17:12.118 --> 17:15.077
- Jason, we need to speak
to you.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.600
- Sure.
What's up?

17:16.644 --> 17:18.124
- In private.

17:19.429 --> 17:20.561
- Now.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.001
- You lied to us, Jason.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.524
You said you haven't seen
Nick Salerno

17:27.568 --> 17:28.830
for two or three months.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.875
- This is you on your way
to breakfast

17:30.919 --> 17:32.529
with the Conserva crew.

17:32.573 --> 17:33.835
- The morning
of the first robbery.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.838
- You were the one feeding
the route information.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.448
- Which makes you part
of this conspiracy.

17:38.492 --> 17:39.797
You are on the hook
for these crimes

17:39.841 --> 17:40.885
just as much as they are.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.148
Whatever they did, you did.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.758
If you cooperate with us

17:43.801 --> 17:45.412
and help us track down
Healy and Jenkins,

17:45.455 --> 17:46.717
we will work with
the U.S. Attorney's Office

17:46.761 --> 17:48.110
and try to get you a deal.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.895
- If you don't, you're staring
down 10 to 15 years.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.900
- They said that no one
was gonna get hurt.

17:55.944 --> 17:58.120
They--they promised.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.600
- Well, I have more bad news
for you.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.123
You know the driver
your boys lit up,

18:01.167 --> 18:03.125
the one that's
in critical condition?

18:03.169 --> 18:04.605
He just died.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.651
So now you're eligible
for the death penalty.

18:11.829 --> 18:14.005
- Turn around.
You're under arrest.

18:14.049 --> 18:19.968
♪

18:25.191 --> 18:26.801
- The more he helps,
the better the deal.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.455
Pretty simple.

18:28.498 --> 18:31.501
But we have a 41-year-old
man with three kids dead.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.634
So, he's gonna do real time,
no matter what.

18:33.677 --> 18:34.765
- I understand.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.071
I just need something to dangle

18:36.115 --> 18:37.594
to persuade him to cooperate.

18:37.638 --> 18:38.726
- Well, if he wants to make
a deal,

18:38.769 --> 18:40.031
even a whiff of a deal,

18:40.075 --> 18:41.598
he needs to make up
his mind now.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.470
Because we're gonna find
Healy and Jenkins

18:43.513 --> 18:45.080
on our own soon enough.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.001
Morgan.
He's a vet, right?

18:53.044 --> 18:54.220
- Yes, ma'am.

18:54.263 --> 18:57.005
- I respect what
you're doing, OA.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.833
But what this guy's
involved in now

18:58.876 --> 19:01.227
has nothing to do
with being a soldier.

19:01.270 --> 19:05.144
I respectfully disagree.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.930
Overseas, what this guy saw,
what he did...

19:08.973 --> 19:12.020
In the name of this country,
that doesn't just go away

19:12.063 --> 19:13.978
when you get home.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.686
- I want to help, but I can't.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.167
That's not who I am.
I'm not a traitor.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.864
- Yes, you are.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.260
- You're the very definition
of a traitor.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.697
You stole information
from your employer--

19:36.740 --> 19:38.699
from your girlfriend,
and you handed it off

19:38.742 --> 19:40.179
to three violent criminals.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.790
I mean the way I see it,
you've betrayed anyone

19:42.833 --> 19:45.053
and everyone who's ever been
good to you.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.751
Kate, your company,
your country--

19:47.795 --> 19:49.579
- No.

19:49.623 --> 19:52.191
My country betrayed me.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.106
I did everything right.

19:55.150 --> 19:58.066
Everything they told me to do.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.894
I went where they
told me to go.

19:59.937 --> 20:03.071
I killed who they
told me to kill.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.725
They called me a hero.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.553
