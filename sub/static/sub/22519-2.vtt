01:39.266 --> 01:41.602
Elsie, what's the matter?

01:41.685 --> 01:44.897
Elsie!

03:17.656 --> 03:22.953
So, Watson.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.162
Hmm.

03:24.246 --> 03:31.295
You do not propose to invest
in South African securities?

03:31.420 --> 03:35.257
How on earth
do you know that?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.510
Now, confess, you are
utterly taken aback.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.220
I am!

03:40.345 --> 03:42.264
I should make you sign a paper
to that effect.

03:42.347 --> 03:42.890
Why?

03:42.973 --> 03:43.974
Because in a few minutes
you will say

03:44.099 --> 03:46.310
it is all
so absurdly simple.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.353
I should say
nothing of the kind!

03:48.437 --> 03:50.898
You see, my dear Watson,
it is not really difficult

03:50.981 --> 03:53.942
to construct a series
of inferences,

03:54.067 --> 03:56.361
each dependent upon
its predecessor

03:56.445 --> 03:58.280
and each simple in itself.

03:58.405 --> 03:58.947
If, after doing so,

03:59.072 --> 04:01.783
one simply knocks out
the central inferences

04:01.909 --> 04:02.993
and presents one's audience

04:03.118 --> 04:06.705
with the starting point
and the conclusion,

04:06.788 --> 04:10.542
one may produce a startling,

04:10.626 --> 04:14.463
though possibly
a meretricious, effect.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.966
I can tell by an inspection
of the groove

04:18.050 --> 04:20.344
between your
left forefinger and thumb,

04:20.469 --> 04:22.596
that you have decided not
to invest your small capital

04:22.721 --> 04:24.431
in the gold fields.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.809
I can see no connection.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.311
Very likely not;

04:29.394 --> 04:31.355
but I can quickly give you
a close connection.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.441
Here are the missing links
in the very simple chain:

04:34.525 --> 04:36.401
You had chalk between
your forefinger and thumb

04:36.485 --> 04:38.237
when you returned
from the club last night.

04:38.320 --> 04:43.158
You put chalk there when you
play billiards, to ease the cue.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.786
You never play billiards
except with Thurston.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.622
Now, Thurston, you told me,
four weeks ago,

04:48.747 --> 04:50.958
had an option on some
South African security

04:51.083 --> 04:52.000
which expired in a month,

04:52.125 --> 04:54.795
and which he desired you
to share with him.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.797
Your checkbook is
locked in my drawer,

04:56.880 --> 04:58.090
and you have not asked
for the key.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.593
So, you do not propose to invest
your money in that manner.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.516
How absurdly simple!

05:10.686 --> 05:12.855
Quite so.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.608
Every problem is absurdly simple
when it is explained to you.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.861
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.613
Holmes, why are you
so cheerful?

05:21.697 --> 05:24.157
You're unemployed,
you have no case to solve.

05:24.241 --> 05:28.161
Now, normally that produces
black moods

05:28.245 --> 05:31.248
and the infernal lethargy
of the cocaine bottle.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.834
You have not used
the logical principles

05:33.959 --> 05:36.253
which I constantly expound.

05:38.172 --> 05:41.717
Sherlock Holmes is cheerful,

05:41.842 --> 05:45.721
so, Sherlock Holmes
must have a case.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.473
Pa!

05:48.557 --> 05:53.896
See what you can make of that,
friend Watson.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.565
Why, Holmes,
it's a child's drawing.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.900
Ah, is that your idea?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.401
Well, what else
should it be?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.403
Well, that is what
a Mr. Hilton Cubitt,

06:01.486 --> 06:04.948
of Ridling Thorpe Manor,
Darbyshire, is anxious to know.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.576
That conundrum came
by the first post,

06:07.701 --> 06:11.246
and he is to follow
by the next train.

06:28.514 --> 06:31.808
Hilton Cubitt.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.478
No, no, I have already
looked him up, Watson.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.773
His family has owned land in
Darbyshire for over 500 years,

06:37.898 --> 06:43.278
so I presume that Mr. Cubitt is
as respectable as he is worthy.

06:44.613 --> 06:48.033
With a fresh face,
an open countenance,

06:48.116 --> 06:51.245
and wearing
a brown bowler hat.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.580
Oh, no, you cannot
possibly know that.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.207
Really, Holmes?

07:01.255 --> 07:04.216
Uh, you will stay and keep
a record of the case?

07:04.299 --> 07:07.594
My dear fellow.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.227
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.938
This way, Mr. Cubitt.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.067
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.110
Hilton Cubitt.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.903
And this is my friend
and colleague, Dr. Watson.

07:24.987 --> 07:25.904
Dr. Watson, sir.

07:25.988 --> 07:26.613
How do you do?

07:26.697 --> 07:27.990
Do sit down, Mr. Cubitt.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.200
Thank you.

07:32.494 --> 07:36.748
So, what do you make of it,
gentlemen? This thing.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.334
Have you had time
to study it?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.211
Absurd little figures
dancing in a line,

07:41.336 --> 07:43.672
it's a childish prank.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.091
Why do you attach importance
to something so trivial?

07:46.175 --> 07:47.384
I don't, Mr. Holmes.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.344
I--I never should.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.181
No, it's--it's--
it's my wife, you see.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.682
She--

07:53.807 --> 07:56.935
Go on, Mr. Cubitt,
you're with friends.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.897
But it's--it's frightened her
almost to death.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.149
She says nothing,
tries to appear normal,

08:02.274 --> 08:08.780
but I've never
seen anyone so upset.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.658
In white chalk on a garden seat,
it is a precise copy?

08:11.783 --> 08:14.203
Oh, it's as exact
as I could make it.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.913
I did think it might be
the stable boy,

08:16.038 --> 08:18.457
but the lad denied it.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.792
If there's any danger
threatening my wife, Mr. Holmes,

08:20.876 --> 08:24.713
I'd spend my last penny
to protect her.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.132
Do sit down, Mr. Cubitt.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.385
Do you smoke, Mr. Cubitt?

08:30.511 --> 08:31.136
Uh, yes.

08:31.220 --> 08:34.681
Uh, no, no, no,
I won't, thank you.

08:39.436 --> 08:46.193
Tell us about your wife,
Mr. Cubitt.

08:46.276 --> 08:50.239
Well, uh, I've always
lived in Darbyshire,

08:50.364 --> 08:53.158
Ridling Thorpe Manor,
near Matlock.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.494
I was a bachelor
and thought I'd remain one

08:55.577 --> 08:59.206
until three years ago I came
down to London on a visit.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.084
It's a rare thing for me, but--

09:02.209 --> 09:05.879
well, I had a mind to see
the Queen's Golden Jubilee.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.340
I put up at a boardinghouse
in Russell Square,

09:08.423 --> 09:11.426
because Parker,
he's the vicar of our parish,

09:11.510 --> 09:14.054
he was staying there.

09:14.179 --> 09:18.058
There was also a young
American lady staying there,

09:18.141 --> 09:21.478
Patrick was her name,
Elsie Patrick.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.648
We were both alone,
and we became friends,

09:24.773 --> 09:26.108
did the sites and that.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.068
At your expense?

09:28.151 --> 09:29.444
Certainly not.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.237
Are you suggesting--

09:30.362 --> 09:34.241
No, he's not,
Mr. Cubitt, not at all.

09:34.324 --> 09:41.331
Was this Miss Elsie Patrick in
London merely for the Jubilee?

09:41.456 --> 09:44.251
No, no, no,
she'd been here some time.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.503
She'd tired of America,
traveled about,

09:46.628 --> 09:49.590
and finally settled
in England.

09:49.715 --> 09:54.761
Well, not to make a labor of it,
before my holiday was over,

09:54.887 --> 09:59.016
I was as much in love
as any man ever has been.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.476
To my surprise
and joy, she--

10:01.560 --> 10:05.772
she reciprocated my feelings,
and we were married.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.107
Excellent.

10:07.191 --> 10:10.736
Quietly, in a--
in a Register Office.

10:10.819 --> 10:13.614
You think I'm mad, Mr. Holmes,
taking a wife in such a fashion,

10:13.739 --> 10:16.575
knowing nothing about her?

10:16.658 --> 10:21.371
Explain, Mr. Cubitt,
and come to the point!

10:21.497 --> 10:29.046
Oh, uh, yes, in fact, it was
on the very day of our marriage.

10:29.171 --> 10:34.760
Nothing could have made me
unhappy, nothing on that day.

10:34.843 --> 10:38.597
But now I look back,
it was odd.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.310
Elsie?

10:43.393 --> 10:46.230
There is something
I have to say to you, Hilton.

10:46.355 --> 10:48.482
We don't want to be late,
my dear.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.776
I've put it off till now.

10:50.859 --> 10:55.697
But I must still give you
the chance to change your mind.

10:55.822 --> 10:59.326
Elsie, what in the world?

10:59.409 --> 11:01.662
Let me finish!

11:01.745 --> 11:05.582
And what I say,
I do mean.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.377
I love you dearly,

11:08.502 --> 11:12.381
but you know nothing of my life
before we met.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.883
I never asked.

11:15.008 --> 11:19.763
One of the things which has
made me so fond of you.

11:19.888 --> 11:23.517
If you marry me, Hilton,
I promise you marry a woman

11:23.642 --> 11:28.272
who has nothing personally
to be ashamed of.

11:28.397 --> 11:31.024
But you'll have to take
my word for it,

11:31.149 --> 11:33.402
and allow me
to be silent forever

11:33.527 --> 11:37.656
as to my life
before we met.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.075
If that's too much to ask,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.578
then you must go back
to your Darbyshire

11:42.703 --> 11:47.082
and leave me to the lonely life
in which you found me.

11:47.207 --> 11:53.589
It's little enough to ask,
and I shall never let you go.

11:55.591 --> 12:00.387
These have been the happiest
three years of my life.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.639
And when did the first cloud

12:02.764 --> 12:09.104
cover the sun
of this great happiness?

12:09.188 --> 12:11.398
You have a way of putting
things, Mr. Holmes.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.191
And you have a way

12:12.274 --> 12:14.902
of prevaricating with
your answers, Mr. Cubitt.

12:17.321 --> 12:20.365
Well, it was, uh,
some months ago, May in fact.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.121
Hilton?!

12:26.205 --> 12:28.290
Hello!

12:28.415 --> 12:31.668
Here, in the drawing room!

12:34.963 --> 12:36.465
Well, what do you think?

12:36.590 --> 12:40.093
Yes, great improvement!

12:42.971 --> 12:45.182
Thank you, Saunders.

12:46.725 --> 12:50.145
I met the postman,
saved him a journey.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.774
Here's a bill.

12:53.857 --> 12:58.445
Here's one for you,
an American stamp, Chicago.

12:58.529 --> 13:01.740
Oh!

13:01.823 --> 13:05.661
I hope lunch is ready,
I'm ravenous.

13:30.686 --> 13:34.523
She burned the letter,
unopened?

13:34.606 --> 13:38.151
Yes, I don't know why.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.362
Of course you don't.

13:40.487 --> 13:44.116
America is her past, and the
subject of a solemn promise.

13:44.199 --> 13:48.036
Yes, but she's not had
an easy hour from that moment.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.373
If only she'd trust me.

13:51.498 --> 13:56.128
Now, I have every faith in her,
you must believe that.

13:56.211 --> 14:00.465
Whatever there was in her past,
I'm sure it's no fault of hers.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.676
And the dancing men?

14:03.886 --> 14:05.721
Oh, yes,

14:05.846 --> 14:08.348
well, I thought she was
getting over the letter,

14:08.473 --> 14:10.684
and then these--
these drawings appeared.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.853
It's just a childish scrawl,

14:12.936 --> 14:15.522
but it made everything
worse than before.

14:15.647 --> 14:18.358
Well, I couldn't
just leave it.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.277
And it wasn't the sort of thing
I could take to the police

14:20.402 --> 14:23.989
for they would have
laughed at me,

14:24.072 --> 14:27.034
so I've come to you.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.955
Don't you think,
Mr. Cubitt,

14:32.080 --> 14:33.499
that your best plan would be

14:33.582 --> 14:35.459
to make a direct appeal
to your wife,

14:35.584 --> 14:38.545
and ask her to share
her secret with you?

14:38.629 --> 14:41.840
A promise is a promise,
Mr. Holmes.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.760
If Elsie wishes to tell me,
then she will.

14:44.843 --> 14:48.263
But I have no right
to force a confidence.

14:48.347 --> 14:54.520
However, I do feel entitled
to take my own line, and I will.

15:05.531 --> 15:08.742
Then I will
help you with all my heart.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.703
Have you seen or heard of any
strangers in the neighborhood?

15:11.787 --> 15:13.205
No, no, I haven't.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.665
Some of the farmers
take in lodgers,

15:14.790 --> 15:18.168
but I've not heard
of any lately.

15:18.293 --> 15:22.130
Then I suggest that you return
to Darbyshire, Mr. Cubitt,

15:22.256 --> 15:23.799
and keep a sharp lookout.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.050
And make an exact copy

15:25.133 --> 15:27.594
of any fresh dancing men
that may appear.

15:27.678 --> 15:30.722
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.
I will.

15:30.806 --> 15:33.183
Oh, and Mr. Cubitt,

15:33.308 --> 15:36.562
this letter which
started your wife's torment,

15:36.645 --> 15:39.690
you are quite certain that
it was from the United States?

15:39.815 --> 15:43.151
Yeah, the postmark was Chicago.

15:52.494 --> 15:58.876
Goodbye!
And don't worry.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.232
It's perfectly natural

16:22.357 --> 16:24.693
she should receive
a letter from America,

16:24.776 --> 16:25.903
she's from America.

16:26.028 --> 16:29.364
Yes, but it is not natural to
throw it onto the fire unopened.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.866
Ah.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.830
It's beginning
to look like semaphore.

16:36.914 --> 16:39.833
You have read my monograph
on secret ciphers?

16:39.917 --> 16:41.710
Some of it.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.213
I found it rather
heavy going.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.757
It evidently has a meaning.

16:46.882 --> 16:51.845
If it is purely arbitrary,
it may be impossible to solve.

16:51.970 --> 16:56.725
However, if it is systematic,

16:56.850 --> 17:00.020
we should be able to get
to the bottom of it.

17:00.145 --> 17:04.566
But we need more messages,
and preferably long ones.

17:04.650 --> 17:08.569
Well, I doubt if Hilton Cubitt
would agree with that.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.947
Walker,

17:59.454 --> 18:01.248
do you know anything
about this?

18:01.373 --> 18:02.291
No, sir.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.459
I've not been out
in the front all day.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.253
Has Mrs. Cubitt
been out here?

18:06.336 --> 18:11.049
I've no way of knowing,
have I, sir?

18:11.133 --> 18:13.302
When I've done this,
I want you to wash it off,

18:13.427 --> 18:16.221
and tell no one about it,
and then come to me.

18:16.305 --> 18:20.475
I shall have an urgent letter
for you to post.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.377
Elsie?

19:29.211 --> 19:33.173
Elsie,

19:33.298 --> 19:34.758
what are you doing?

19:34.883 --> 19:36.760
I was looking for you.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.640
I thought I heard the door.

19:41.723 --> 19:47.062
Have you been out today,
out of the house?

20:02.077 --> 20:05.622
Hilton, come to bed,

20:05.747 --> 20:08.917
everything will look better
in the morning.

20:09.042 --> 20:12.212
Will the drawings look better?!

20:12.296 --> 20:14.756
Will the dancing men
look better?!

20:14.840 --> 20:16.341
Why do they fuss you so?

20:16.425 --> 20:18.051
Fuss me?!

20:18.135 --> 20:21.513
They're just a joke,
a bit of mischief!

20:31.148 --> 20:34.109
The moon's high.

20:36.111 --> 20:42.743
Where I come from, they say a
moon like that drives you crazy.

20:57.049 --> 21:00.969
Why don't we travel, Hilton,
why don't we go away?

21:14.650 --> 21:21.073
I love this place
as much as I love you.

21:21.156 --> 21:24.785
Hilton--

21:27.371 --> 21:28.288
What did you see?

21:28.372 --> 21:30.791
Nothing, nothing at all!

21:30.874 --> 21:32.918
Please, dearest.

21:34.753 --> 21:35.796
Hilton, I beg you!

21:35.921 --> 21:38.632
There's somebody outside.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.634
Hilton!

21:40.717 --> 21:43.762
Hilton, wait!

21:43.846 --> 21:45.806
You'll come to harm!

21:45.889 --> 21:49.852
Or are you afraid
he will come to harm?!

22:08.537 --> 22:10.664
These two are identical.

22:10.789 --> 22:12.166
Yes.

22:12.249 --> 22:13.876
Well, I had that one
washed off,

22:14.001 --> 22:16.128
then it must have reappeared.

22:16.211 --> 22:19.173
You know, it's a pity you didn't
get a closer look at this chap.

22:19.256 --> 22:21.425
If only she hadn't
tried to stop me.

22:21.550 --> 22:23.302
I've never been angry
with her before,

22:23.385 --> 22:26.054
but she knew who was out there,
of that I'm sure.

22:26.180 --> 22:29.892
And she knows
what these figures mean.

22:30.017 --> 22:32.561
Was this a mere
addition to this,

22:32.686 --> 22:35.063
or did it appear to be
entirely separate?

22:35.147 --> 22:38.317
That was on a separate panel
of the door.

22:46.575 --> 22:49.745
Well, I know
what I'm going to do,

22:49.870 --> 22:51.788
I shall go home,

22:51.914 --> 22:54.500
sit with half a dozen of my lads
in the shrubbery,

22:54.583 --> 22:55.292
and if this fellow
calls again,

22:55.417 --> 22:58.045
give him such a thrashing he'll
leave us alone in the future.

22:58.128 --> 22:59.671
Well, that would
be one way.

22:59.755 --> 23:07.429
Mr. Cubitt, this case is too
deep for such a simple remedy.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.599
I must go now
if I'm to catch my train.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.434
I'd not leave
Elsie alone at night.

23:12.559 --> 23:13.268
Elsie!

23:13.393 --> 23:14.645
Quite right.

23:14.770 --> 23:17.189
Good day, Mr. Cubitt.

23:17.272 --> 23:20.776
We will join you in a couple
of days, and be patient!

23:20.901 --> 23:22.069
Good bye, Dr. Watson.

23:22.194 --> 23:23.612
I'll find my own way.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.572
Bye.

23:28.450 --> 23:31.245
You weren't
exactly sympathetic.

23:31.328 --> 23:34.581
He doesn't come to me
for sympathy.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.972
It is a considerable challenge.

23:50.097 --> 23:53.100
I shall work better
for silence.

23:53.225 --> 23:54.768
Oh, well,

23:54.852 --> 23:59.314
I dare say I can find
something quiet to do.

24:38.020 --> 24:41.982
Whoa, sit.

24:42.107 --> 24:43.025
Where did you find this?

24:43.150 --> 24:45.360
Down by the garden bench.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.320
Will that, uh, mean

24:46.403 --> 24:51.325
you'll be wanting me to take
another letter for London, sir?

24:51.408 --> 24:53.494
Very well.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.788
I'll have to get a move on if
I'm gonna catch the last post.

24:56.872 --> 25:01.043
Walker, just do
what you're told!

25:09.551 --> 25:10.677
Yes, Watson?

25:10.802 --> 25:15.015
Uh, I thought you
might like the Times, Holmes.

25:15.140 --> 25:18.810
What do you make
of my progress?

25:18.894 --> 25:21.939
Well, it still
doesn't mean very much, does it?

25:22.064 --> 25:26.527
Quite enough for me to send
a telegram to the United States.

25:26.610 --> 25:29.738
What on earth does
that mean, "ABESLANE"?

25:29.863 --> 25:34.701
Watson, if this is E,

25:34.785 --> 25:37.371
flag denotes
the end of words.

26:27.462 --> 26:33.927
Mm, this grouse is superb.

26:34.011 --> 26:40.017
Mrs. Hudson has really surpassed
herself this time.

26:40.142 --> 26:43.270
What time is the last train
to Matlock?

26:43.353 --> 26:45.189
I'm afraid we've missed it.

26:47.983 --> 26:53.614
Holmes, I do wish
you would try and eat a bite.

26:53.739 --> 26:58.202
I just need an answer
to my telegram from America,

26:58.327 --> 27:00.954
and the story is complete.

28:36.425 --> 28:39.928
Abe, I wanna stay,
and I'm going to stay.

28:40.053 --> 28:42.639
What about your
friends in Chicago?

28:42.764 --> 28:44.600
What about your family?!

28:44.725 --> 28:46.310
Friends do you call them;

28:46.435 --> 28:50.397
killers, robbers,
extortionists, some family.

28:50.522 --> 28:52.649
But you and I
were engaged!

28:52.774 --> 28:56.361
I'm sorry, Abe,
my father forced me into it.

28:56.445 --> 28:59.448
How could I be happy
with you in that life?!

29:02.201 --> 29:07.748
Please go away,
please, I beg you.

29:07.831 --> 29:09.583
You beg me?!

29:09.666 --> 29:11.460
Yes.

29:11.585 --> 29:12.628
Hilton is
such a good man.

29:12.753 --> 29:17.424
It would break my heart
if scandal ever touched him.

29:17.508 --> 29:20.427
Here's money,

29:20.511 --> 29:22.346
it's all that I have.

29:34.775 --> 29:35.567
No!

29:35.651 --> 29:36.235
You're coming home!

29:36.318 --> 29:36.818
No!

29:36.944 --> 29:37.402
You're coming home!

29:37.486 --> 29:38.278
No!

29:38.403 --> 29:40.697
What the--

29:40.823 --> 29:41.698
No!!

29:47.746 --> 29:49.122
Watson?

29:51.542 --> 29:54.002
What the devil is going on?

29:55.838 --> 29:57.089
An answer to your telegram?

29:57.172 --> 30:00.801
No, it's another letter
from Hilton Cubitt.

30:08.225 --> 30:12.354
"ELSIE

30:12.479 --> 30:15.357
PRE-P ARE."

30:36.420 --> 30:37.462
Mr. Holmes, sir.

30:37.546 --> 30:39.631
Thank you.

30:42.551 --> 30:46.096
It's from Wilson Hargreave,
of the Chicago Police Bureau.

30:46.221 --> 30:47.181
"In reply to your inquiry,

30:47.264 --> 30:49.933
Abe Slaney is one of the most
dangerous men in Chicago."

30:53.228 --> 30:55.355
Come along, come along.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.236
There's a cab!

31:01.361 --> 31:02.738
Ridling Thorpe Manor,
gentlemen?

31:02.863 --> 31:04.740
As fast as you can!

31:06.783 --> 31:08.160
How do you know?

31:08.243 --> 31:10.829
Bet you're the surgeon
from London, sir.

31:10.913 --> 31:12.164
I beg your pardon,
what makes you--

31:12.247 --> 31:13.624
She's not dead yet, sir.

31:13.749 --> 31:18.462
You may be able to save her,
but she's for the gallows.

31:18.587 --> 31:20.005
The gallows?!

31:20.088 --> 31:23.467
Right, sir,
she murdered her husband.

31:55.374 --> 31:59.211
Inspector of Police, and Doctor
of Medicine, I perceive?

31:59.294 --> 32:02.923
Yes, indeed, Inspector Martin,
Darbyshire Constabulary.

32:03.048 --> 32:05.801
And I am Dr. Carthew,
the surgeon.

32:05.926 --> 32:06.885
This way, gentlemen.

32:06.969 --> 32:09.721
This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

32:09.805 --> 32:14.268
and I am his friend
and colleague, Dr. Watson.

32:16.186 --> 32:21.358
Mr. Holmes, but what do you know
of this business?!

32:21.483 --> 32:23.735
A good deal.

32:23.819 --> 32:27.739
Mr. Hilton Cubitt
was my client.

32:27.823 --> 32:30.951
But the crime was only committed
at 3:00 o'clock this morning.

32:31.076 --> 32:32.244
How could you hear of it
in London

32:32.327 --> 32:33.787
and get to the spot
as soon as I?

32:33.871 --> 32:35.289
I anticipated it.

32:35.372 --> 32:40.085
We came in hope
of preventing it.

32:40.169 --> 32:41.295
Then you must have
important evidence

32:41.420 --> 32:42.963
of which I am ignorant.

32:43.046 --> 32:45.382
Only the evidence
of the dancing men.

32:45.507 --> 32:46.091
The dancing men?

32:46.175 --> 32:49.178
I will explain
all that to you later.

32:49.970 --> 32:54.141
Since we are too late
to prevent this tragedy,

32:54.224 --> 32:57.436
I am anxious to insure
that justice is done.

32:57.519 --> 32:59.438
Will you associate me
in your investigation,

32:59.521 --> 33:01.982
or will you prefer that
I should act independently?

33:03.025 --> 33:06.320
I should be proud for us
to work together, Mr. Holmes.

33:06.445 --> 33:09.573
But I must warn you, there seems
very little to investigate.

33:09.698 --> 33:14.036
Mr. Hilton Cubitt has been shot
through the heart and he's dead.

33:15.662 --> 33:20.042
And Mrs. Cubitt?

33:20.125 --> 33:22.628
Seriously wounded.

33:22.711 --> 33:24.463
The bullet passed through
the front of her brain,

33:24.546 --> 33:27.049
and she's still unconscious.

33:27.174 --> 33:29.384
Excuse me, gentlemen.

33:30.928 --> 33:34.973
Only one gun has been found,
lying on the floor between them.

33:35.057 --> 33:37.142
Two bullets have been fired.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.268
With respect, Mr. Holmes,

33:38.393 --> 33:41.104
it seems quite clear that
Mrs. Cubitt murdered her husband

33:41.230 --> 33:43.607
and then turned the gun
upon herself.

33:43.732 --> 33:47.110
But they were
a most devoted couple!

33:47.236 --> 33:49.363
The murder room is through here,
Mr. Holmes.

33:49.488 --> 33:54.409
No, I would like to start
by interviewing the servants.

33:54.493 --> 33:55.327
And I beg you, nothing,

33:55.410 --> 33:58.789
absolutely nothing
is to be moved.

34:02.876 --> 34:05.546
Is this the way
to the kitchen?

34:10.551 --> 34:12.553
I should think it must
have happened about

34:12.636 --> 34:16.681
3:00 o'clock
in the morning, sir.

34:16.764 --> 34:18.308
Where are your rooms?

34:18.433 --> 34:19.101
On top, sir.

34:19.226 --> 34:20.351
The attics!

34:20.435 --> 34:22.728
I was awoke
by this terrible bang,

34:22.813 --> 34:25.732
an explosion
is the only word.

34:25.815 --> 34:26.984
And about a minute later--

34:27.109 --> 34:27.650
It was less than a minute.

34:27.775 --> 34:31.405
--there was another bang,
only not so loud.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.072
What did you do?

34:33.157 --> 34:34.783
We came downstairs, sir,

34:34.908 --> 34:36.909
expecting to find
Mr. Cubitt up and about,

34:36.994 --> 34:39.913
chasing burglars or
the house on fire, or--

34:39.996 --> 34:41.956
And the bedroom door was open.

34:42.081 --> 34:45.585
We looked in but the bed
was empty so we came on down.

34:45.668 --> 34:46.420
There was smoke,

34:46.545 --> 34:48.338
and the smell
was worse down here.

34:48.463 --> 34:50.591
Smell?

34:50.674 --> 34:52.509
Ah, you mean
of the gunpowder?

34:52.634 --> 34:55.596
I suppose it was, sir, yes.

34:55.721 --> 34:57.431
Now, you say the smell
was worse downstairs.

34:57.514 --> 34:59.683
Could you also smell
gunpowder upstairs?

34:59.808 --> 35:01.602
Yes, sir.

35:01.685 --> 35:02.436
I commend that fact

35:02.519 --> 35:05.272
very carefully to your
attention, Inspector.

35:05.355 --> 35:07.441
Mrs. King,

35:11.528 --> 35:14.823
would you like to sit down,
Mrs. King?

35:16.533 --> 35:22.080
Now, was the library door
open when you reached it?

35:22.164 --> 35:24.249
Open, yes, sir.

35:24.333 --> 35:28.045
We could see the candle alight
on the table and so we came in.

35:28.170 --> 35:32.049
Then, oh dear,

35:32.174 --> 35:36.470
as terrible a thing as
ever I saw or ever fear to see.

35:36.553 --> 35:39.223
She was terrible
wounded, sir.

35:39.348 --> 35:41.391
She was moaning and groaning,

35:41.517 --> 35:43.268
then she sort of
collapsed on the floor

35:43.352 --> 35:46.772
and she hasn't said
anything since.

35:47.481 --> 35:49.816
Saunders?

35:49.942 --> 35:51.860
We moved her
to her bedroom, sir,

35:51.944 --> 35:55.197
and sent Fred Walker for
the doctor and the police.

35:56.365 --> 36:01.829
And there was no sign of
a break-in, or of an intruder?

36:01.954 --> 36:02.996
No, sir.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.748
And all the doors
and windows was locked,

36:04.873 --> 36:07.960
as we had left them
when we went to bed.

36:09.545 --> 36:11.880
Inspector...

36:12.005 --> 36:14.383
Oh, yes...

36:16.385 --> 36:19.304
Apart from poor Mrs. Cubitt,

36:19.388 --> 36:21.139
nothing else
has been moved?

36:21.223 --> 36:22.015
No, sir.

36:22.140 --> 36:25.894
No, we've touched nothing,
Mr. Holmes.

36:26.019 --> 36:29.022
Thank you.
Then I think we can proceed.

36:35.529 --> 36:39.283
Almost instantaneous death,
presumably.

36:39.408 --> 36:42.870
Mm, straight
through the heart.

36:42.995 --> 36:47.291
The bullet's still there.

36:47.416 --> 36:50.711
What about the bullet
that wounded Mrs. Cubitt?

36:50.836 --> 36:53.005
That's still in her, as well.

36:53.088 --> 36:57.092
It will take hands more nimble
than mine to move it.

36:59.052 --> 37:01.430
Is this Mrs. Cubitt's handbag?

37:01.513 --> 37:04.266
Yes, it is, Mr. Holmes.

37:04.391 --> 37:08.145
At least twenty
50-pound notes,

37:08.270 --> 37:11.690
a bribe that failed.

37:14.026 --> 37:18.530
So, two bullets fired,

37:18.614 --> 37:20.407
two wounds inflicted,
as you said.

37:20.532 --> 37:21.617
Yes, Doctor.

37:21.742 --> 37:22.951
Then how do you account
for the bullet

37:23.076 --> 37:28.499
that has so obviously
struck the window frame?

37:29.958 --> 37:32.628
By George,
however did you see that?!

37:32.753 --> 37:36.381
Because, Dr. Carthew,
I looked for it.

37:36.465 --> 37:39.760
Wonderful, why,
the bullet's still there!

37:39.885 --> 37:42.763
So a third shot
must have been fired.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.974
Which means that a third person
must have been present.

37:46.099 --> 37:48.185
Exactly!

37:48.310 --> 37:49.770
When you came into
this room last night,

37:49.895 --> 37:54.066
you say that the door was ajar;
was not that window also open?

37:54.149 --> 37:55.776
I don't know, sir.

37:55.901 --> 37:56.944
No, sir.

37:57.027 --> 37:58.779
It was shut.

37:58.862 --> 38:02.282
Saunders, will you and Cook
wait in the library,

38:02.366 --> 38:05.077
and you, Walker.

38:05.702 --> 38:10.666
Dr. Carthew,
you may remove the body.

38:18.423 --> 38:22.469
It was Mrs. Cubitt herself
who shut that window.

38:22.553 --> 38:28.559
If Saunders and the Cook smelled
smoke and gunpowder upstairs,

38:28.684 --> 38:33.397
then there must have been
a strong through draft.

38:33.522 --> 38:35.190
Otherwise, it would not
have spread so quickly

38:35.315 --> 38:36.483
through the house.

38:36.567 --> 38:40.028
We know that door was open,

38:40.154 --> 38:42.114
that window, too,
must also have been open,

38:42.197 --> 38:43.991
but only for a short time.

38:44.074 --> 38:47.119
Why only for a short time?

38:47.202 --> 38:50.205
Because the candles
have not gutted.

38:50.289 --> 38:52.833
There is
no trail of wax.

38:52.958 --> 38:56.253
Wonderful, wonderful!

38:59.756 --> 39:01.216
If the late Mr. Hilton Cubitt

39:01.341 --> 39:06.138
fired the bullet which
pierced the window frame,

39:06.221 --> 39:08.015
he must have been
aiming at

39:08.140 --> 39:12.352
someone who was
standing either inside

39:12.477 --> 39:14.188
or just outside the window.

39:14.313 --> 39:15.731
Oh, thank you, Inspector.

39:15.814 --> 39:18.025
Which means that the bullet
which killed Mr. Cubitt

39:18.108 --> 39:19.234
could have been fired by--

39:19.359 --> 39:23.655
Inspector, your thoughts
and mine agree entirely.

39:45.761 --> 39:47.513
This is the cartridge case

39:47.596 --> 39:53.310
of the bullet which killed
Mr. Hilton Cubitt.

40:01.777 --> 40:05.072
Holmes,

40:05.155 --> 40:06.615
if three shots were fired,

40:06.740 --> 40:11.703
why did Mrs. King and Saunders
only hear two shots?

40:11.829 --> 40:15.874
They were telling the truth,
but lied without realizing it.

40:15.958 --> 40:18.961
I'm not sure
that I follow you.

40:19.086 --> 40:22.756
You remember
what Mrs. King said,

40:22.840 --> 40:28.595
"I was awoken by this
terrible bang, an explosion,

40:28.720 --> 40:29.429
it is the only word.

40:29.555 --> 40:30.472
And then a minute later

40:30.597 --> 40:34.685
there was another bang
but not so loud."

40:34.810 --> 40:41.441
The first bang was two shots,
fired almost simultaneously;

40:41.567 --> 40:44.069
one from the window,
which killed Hilton Cubitt,

40:44.153 --> 40:45.445
and one from Hilton Cubitt,

40:45.571 --> 40:48.574
which missed and went
into the window frame.

40:50.325 --> 40:54.163
And the third shot?

40:54.288 --> 41:00.085
The saddest of all,
Mrs. Cubitt,

41:00.169 --> 41:03.922
self-administered
in her despair.

41:06.258 --> 41:12.723
Now, do any of you know of
an inn in the neighborhood

41:12.848 --> 41:16.977
called Elrige's?

41:20.022 --> 41:23.817
There's a farmer of that name,
lives some miles off,

41:23.942 --> 41:27.070
in the direction of,
uh, Milbrook.

41:27.196 --> 41:28.822
Is it a lonely farm?

41:28.906 --> 41:30.908
Very lonely, sir.

41:31.033 --> 41:32.242
Then it is just possible

41:32.367 --> 41:33.827
that the news of what happened
here last night

41:33.952 --> 41:35.496
has not reached them.

41:35.621 --> 41:37.372
Maybe not, sir.

41:37.498 --> 41:39.166
Excellent!

41:39.249 --> 41:42.002
Walker,

41:42.085 --> 41:43.295
I want you
to take this note

41:43.378 --> 41:47.257
to a Mr. Abe Slaney
of Elrige's Farm.

41:47.382 --> 41:49.885
Do not say that
the note is from me,

41:50.010 --> 41:52.054
and make no mention of
what happened here last night.

41:52.179 --> 41:54.264
Now, you understand?

41:54.389 --> 41:56.808
Yes, sir.

41:56.892 --> 41:59.937
Thank you, Walker.

42:00.896 --> 42:08.445
I am expecting a visitor
in answer to my note.

42:09.196 --> 42:12.366
Now, Saunders, he will
ask for Mrs. Cubitt.

42:12.449 --> 42:15.410
I want you to show him
into this room.

42:15.494 --> 42:18.080
I want this house
to look quite normal,

42:18.205 --> 42:22.584
and you must not give anything
away of what has happened.

42:22.668 --> 42:24.837
Very good, sir.

42:24.920 --> 42:28.048
Now, I suggest you return
to your duties.

42:28.131 --> 42:32.386
And, Dr. Carthew, I suggest
you return to your patient.

42:33.929 --> 42:37.057
Oh, Mrs. King,

42:37.140 --> 42:41.270
your mistress
is quite innocent.

43:04.459 --> 43:06.962
But how did
you break the code?

43:07.045 --> 43:09.173
Well, you see,

43:09.298 --> 43:13.802
the rules which guide us in
deciphering all secret writing

43:13.927 --> 43:15.596
depend on the fact that E,

43:15.679 --> 43:21.435
E is the most common letter
in the English language.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.061
So, you see,
we were very fortunate

43:23.145 --> 43:26.565
that Mrs. Cubitt's name
was Elsie,

43:26.648 --> 43:28.233
and that it featured
in the second message,

43:28.317 --> 43:34.781
which gave us not only the E,
but the L, the S and the I.

43:34.907 --> 43:37.284
Now, next,
it seemed likely to us

43:37.367 --> 43:40.621
that two of the messages
were appeals of some sort

43:40.746 --> 43:43.165
to Mrs. Cubitt...

43:57.679 --> 44:01.517
...by adding the T and the G,
the message reads:

44:01.642 --> 44:07.314
"AT ELRIGE'S, COME ELSIE."

44:08.857 --> 44:11.151
Well, if this Abe Slaney
is indeed the murderer,

44:11.235 --> 44:13.362
we must make an immediate move
to arrest him.

44:13.487 --> 44:14.530
Calm yourself, Inspector.

44:14.655 --> 44:16.824
I expect him here
at any moment.

44:16.949 --> 44:18.492
But why should
Slaney come here?

44:18.575 --> 44:20.619
Because I have written
and asked him.

44:20.702 --> 44:22.871
But won't his
suspicions be roused?

44:22.996 --> 44:24.289
Will he not try to escape?

44:24.373 --> 44:25.374
Saunders?

44:25.457 --> 44:29.211
Excuse me, sir, there's a
gentleman approaching the house.

44:31.338 --> 44:33.423
Do you think he'd be armed?

44:33.549 --> 44:36.176
He's a fool if he's not.

44:50.524 --> 44:51.859
Good day, sir.

44:51.942 --> 44:53.485
Is Mrs. Cubitt at home?

44:53.569 --> 44:57.281
I'll inquire, sir,
if you'll step inside.

45:05.372 --> 45:07.374
What name shall I say?

45:07.499 --> 45:10.127
Tell her it's an old friend.
She's expecting me.

45:10.252 --> 45:13.005
If you'll wait
in the library a moment.

45:29.313 --> 45:32.608
Well, gentlemen, it looks like
you've got the drop on me,

45:32.733 --> 45:35.027
but what the hell
is going on?

45:35.110 --> 45:37.237
Abe Slaney, I believe.

45:37.321 --> 45:38.864
What if I am,
and who are you, anyway?

45:38.947 --> 45:40.199
My name would mean
nothing to you,

45:40.282 --> 45:42.201
though I suspect
that of Wilson Hargreave

45:42.284 --> 45:45.162
of the Chicago Police
Department, will.

45:46.163 --> 45:49.583
Ah, I see that it does.

45:52.419 --> 45:55.964
Mr. Slaney,
you should know

45:56.089 --> 46:01.470
that Mrs. Elsie Cubitt
is very seriously ill.

46:01.595 --> 46:03.597
I don't believe you.

46:03.722 --> 46:06.225
This is some cheap trick.

46:06.350 --> 46:09.811
Mrs. Elsie Cubitt wrote me
a note just an hour ago,

46:09.895 --> 46:11.939
a note that only
I can understand.

46:12.022 --> 46:16.401
What one man can invent,
another can discover:

46:17.152 --> 46:23.951
"I'M HERE, ABE SLANEY.
AT ELRIGE'S, COME ELSIE."

46:24.076 --> 46:25.494
And your last note to her:

46:25.619 --> 46:29.748
"ELSIE PREPARE
TO MEET THY GOD."

46:30.916 --> 46:33.418
And this.

46:33.544 --> 46:36.505
You wrote that note?

46:36.630 --> 46:37.840
But you were lying about Elsie.

46:37.965 --> 46:41.093
Slaney, when you shot and killed
Hilton Cubitt,

46:41.176 --> 46:45.305
Elsie Cubitt, in her despair,
attempted to kill herself,

46:45.389 --> 46:46.557
and is now
at death's door.

46:46.682 --> 46:47.850
No.

46:47.975 --> 46:49.810
No, I gotta see her!!

46:49.893 --> 46:52.479
I gotta see her, I love her,
for God's sake, Elsie!!

46:52.563 --> 46:54.481
I love you, Elsie!!

46:54.565 --> 46:56.817
Elsie, Elsie!!

46:56.942 --> 47:00.362
I believe that she fled
from America to avoid you.

47:00.487 --> 47:02.906
Because you followed her
and made her life a misery,

47:03.031 --> 47:04.575
she now lies
under grave suspicion

47:04.700 --> 47:07.035
of murdering the husband
she loved.

47:07.161 --> 47:11.748
The least you can do
is to clear her of that.

47:14.376 --> 47:17.421
I guess the very best case
I can make for myself now

47:17.546 --> 47:20.841
is to tell you
the absolute, naked truth.

47:20.966 --> 47:22.134
It is my duty to warn you

47:22.217 --> 47:26.597
that it will be
used against you.

47:26.722 --> 47:27.681
I guess you probably know

47:27.806 --> 47:31.143
that Elsie's father's the most
powerful man in Chicago.

47:31.226 --> 47:35.856
One of the most powerful
criminal men in Chicago.

47:35.981 --> 47:39.109
It was he who invented
the dancing men.

47:39.234 --> 47:41.487
We used it as a code
in the old days.

47:41.570 --> 47:43.405
I've known Elsie
since she was a child.

47:43.530 --> 47:45.282
She was promised to me.

47:45.407 --> 47:46.450
I may have threatened her,

47:46.575 --> 47:50.996
but I wouldn't have touched
a hair on her pretty head.

47:51.079 --> 47:55.709
But you're right, she hated
the whole Chicago business.

47:55.834 --> 47:58.879
That's why she ran away
to Europe.

47:59.004 --> 48:01.924
It was only after her marriage
to this Englishman

48:02.007 --> 48:04.218
that I was able
to find out where she was.

48:04.343 --> 48:08.388
I wrote to her,
but I got no answer.

48:08.472 --> 48:10.807
She burned your letter.

48:10.933 --> 48:15.854
She was happy in her
new life in Darbyshire.

48:15.938 --> 48:20.234
I came here to England
to take her home!

48:20.317 --> 48:22.069
I sent her notes.

48:22.194 --> 48:24.613
I did everything I could
to coax Elsie away,

48:24.738 --> 48:29.284
then my temper got the better of
me and I began to threaten her.

48:29.409 --> 48:33.121
But yesterday
she sent me a letter!

48:33.247 --> 48:35.916
She said she would come down
when her husband was asleep

48:35.999 --> 48:39.378
and speak to me
through the end window

48:39.461 --> 48:44.967
if I would go away afterwards
and leave her in peace.

48:45.092 --> 48:51.723
Can I make you see?

48:51.807 --> 48:55.310
I've never been so happy
as I've been here with him.

48:55.435 --> 48:57.521
I love him.

48:59.940 --> 49:03.819
Abe, I wanna stay,
and I'm going to stay.

49:03.944 --> 49:06.238
What about your
friends in Chicago?

49:06.321 --> 49:08.198
What about your family?!

49:08.323 --> 49:09.825
Friends do you call them;

49:09.950 --> 49:13.954
killers, robbers,
extortionists, some family.

49:14.079 --> 49:16.290
But you and I
were engaged!

49:16.373 --> 49:19.084
I'm sorry, Abe,
my father forced me into it.

49:19.168 --> 49:25.465
How could I be happy
with you in that life?!

49:25.549 --> 49:31.180
Please go away,
please, I beg you.

49:31.305 --> 49:32.973
You beg me?!

49:33.098 --> 49:35.017
Yes.

49:35.142 --> 49:36.143
Hilton is
such a good man.

49:36.268 --> 49:39.563
It would break my heart
if scandal ever touched him.

49:41.190 --> 49:44.526
Here's money,

49:44.651 --> 49:46.820
it's all that I have.

49:46.945 --> 49:51.492
Now, please go away.

49:53.535 --> 49:54.161
No!

49:54.286 --> 49:54.870
You're coming home!

49:54.995 --> 49:55.496
No!

49:55.621 --> 49:56.163
You're coming home!

49:56.288 --> 49:56.914
No!

49:57.039 --> 49:58.999
What the--

50:05.088 --> 50:06.673
No!!

51:22.166 --> 51:26.503
I think we've heard enough
for the moment, come along.

51:26.628 --> 51:28.589
Can't I see her before I go?

51:28.714 --> 51:31.133
Nobody can see her,

51:31.258 --> 51:35.637
even we have not
been given that privilege.

51:41.727 --> 51:44.646
Mr. Holmes,

51:44.730 --> 51:47.691
I hope that if ever again
I have an important case,

51:47.816 --> 51:51.612
I shall have the good fortune
to have you by my side.

51:51.737 --> 51:55.282
Good afternoon,
and thank you.

51:59.077 --> 52:00.162
Holmes?

52:00.287 --> 52:01.455
Hmm.

52:01.538 --> 52:04.583
What did you write
in that note?

52:06.001 --> 52:07.961
See if you could read it.

52:11.381 --> 52:22.142
"COME-HERE-AT-ONCE,"

52:22.226 --> 52:25.312
"COME HERE AT ONCE."

52:25.395 --> 52:29.441
How absurdly simple.

52:30.192 --> 52:31.944
And so the dancing men,

52:32.027 --> 52:34.154
which had so often been
the agents of evil,

52:34.279 --> 52:37.241
were finally used
on the side of justice.

52:37.366 --> 52:40.369
Abe Slaney was condemned
to death at the Darby assizes,

52:40.494 --> 52:42.663
but his sentence was
changed to penal servitude

52:42.788 --> 52:45.833
