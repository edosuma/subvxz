00:47.356 --> 00:50.984
My name is Ash,
and I am a slave.

00:51.193 --> 00:53.987
- Aah !

00:54.196 --> 00:56.823
Close as I can figure it,
the year is 1300 A.D.,

00:57.032 --> 00:59.451
and I'm being
dragged to my death.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.287
It wasn't always
like this.

01:02.496 --> 01:06.208
I had
a real life once.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.627
A job.

01:08.835 --> 01:13.590
Ash to price check four.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.176
Um, hardware, aisle 12.

01:16.385 --> 01:18.345
Shop smart.
Shop S-mart.

01:18.553 --> 01:23.225
I had a wonderful
girlfriend, Linda.

01:24.810 --> 01:29.356
Together, we drove to
a small cabin in the mountains.

01:32.150 --> 01:34.861
It seems an archaeologist
had come to this remote place...

01:35.070 --> 01:37.864
to translate and study
his latest find,

01:38.073 --> 01:41.201
"Necronomicon Ex Mortis,"

01:41.410 --> 01:45.330
"The Book of the Dead."

01:45.580 --> 01:49.001
Bound in human flesh
and inked in blood,

01:49.209 --> 01:53.547
this ancient Sumerian text
contained bizarre burial rites,

01:53.755 --> 01:58.802
funerary incantations
and demon resurrection passages.

01:59.011 --> 02:01.930
It was never meant
for the world of the living.

02:02.139 --> 02:07.269
The book awoke
something dark in the woods.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.735
It took Linda.

02:14.943 --> 02:17.779
- And then it came for me.

02:17.988 --> 02:20.949
It got into my hand
and it went bad.

02:21.158 --> 02:23.577
So I lopped it off
at the wrist.

02:29.833 --> 02:32.461
But that didn't stop it.
It came back.

02:32.669 --> 02:36.256
- Big time.

02:36.465 --> 02:38.925
Ah !

02:39.134 --> 02:42.679
Aah !

02:51.813 --> 02:55.108
My God !

02:55.317 --> 02:57.152
How do you stop it ?

03:53.875 --> 03:55.961
- Surround the stranger !

03:59.047 --> 04:01.800
All right,
you men, fall in !

04:06.388 --> 04:08.682
All o' ya, keep a pace !

04:08.890 --> 04:11.935
Where in the hell--

04:18.858 --> 04:20.902
Stand fast, hellhound !

04:21.111 --> 04:24.406
No, no.
Easy now, chief.

04:24.615 --> 04:26.366
Uh, I don't know
how I got here,

04:26.575 --> 04:30.871
- and, uh, uh, I'm not
looking for any trouble.

04:33.248 --> 04:37.336
What a piece of armor this is !

04:37.586 --> 04:40.005
- Wise man !
- Fall back ! Come on, all you men.

04:40.213 --> 04:43.592
Back on your horses.
Come on !

04:44.301 --> 04:48.013
My lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.515
He who's prophesied to fall
from the heavens...

04:50.724 --> 04:53.518
and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.312
What, that buffoon ?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.856
Likely...

04:58.065 --> 04:59.900
he's one
of Henry's men !

05:00.108 --> 05:04.029
- Kneel, rapscallions !

05:04.196 --> 05:06.907
I say
to the pit with him !

05:07.115 --> 05:11.078
You shall soon
learn the horrors of the pit.

05:11.286 --> 05:14.623
- To the pit !
- You miserable bast--

05:14.831 --> 05:19.878
- Get him !
- Get off of me !

05:20.504 --> 05:23.298
- Let me go !
- Chain him !

05:25.968 --> 05:27.928
Ah, you're gonna have
a little bit of wee fun, mate.

05:30.305 --> 05:33.892
To the castle !

05:35.143 --> 05:38.063
Pick up your feet !
Stop draggin' your feet !

05:38.272 --> 05:40.399
Come on !
Move along !

05:40.607 --> 05:42.567
Come on, now.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.612
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this !

05:52.869 --> 05:55.831
You men got something
to look forward to...

05:56.039 --> 05:59.543
when you get back to the castle.

05:59.751 --> 06:01.545
Lord Arthur approaches !

06:01.753 --> 06:04.631
Raise the portcullis !

06:04.840 --> 06:10.971
Lord Arthur !
Lord Arthur approaches !

06:14.683 --> 06:16.810
That's lovely, isn't it ?
Move it in.

06:17.019 --> 06:20.772
Move it,
you worthless--

06:20.981 --> 06:24.484
- Get on !

06:39.333 --> 06:42.586
Move it up, boys.
God save the king !

06:42.794 --> 06:45.547
God save the king.
We love him !

06:47.883 --> 06:51.136
Arthur !
He's back !

06:51.345 --> 06:55.974
Lord Arthur, where is my brother ?
Did he not ride with you ?

06:56.183 --> 06:58.143
Aye,
and fought valiantly.

06:58.352 --> 07:01.730
But last night he fell in battle
to Duke Henry's men.

07:01.939 --> 07:03.982
I'm sorry, Sheila.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.859
Come on.

07:06.068 --> 07:09.321
You cretin !
Ah, stop it, you bastard !

07:11.531 --> 07:13.492
You barbarian !

07:13.700 --> 07:16.536
- Oh, no ! Stop it ! Stop it !

07:16.745 --> 07:18.914
Get outta here,
you little brat !

07:22.751 --> 07:26.797
Foul thing !
A pox on you, brute !

07:27.005 --> 07:29.925
Thou art a murderer !
A black murderer !

07:35.138 --> 07:37.057
My brother's death
shall be avenged !

07:51.822 --> 07:55.450
Company, halt !

07:57.619 --> 08:01.206
Get that yoke off 'im !

08:01.915 --> 08:04.543
Kill them !

08:04.751 --> 08:06.628
Put them into the pit !

08:13.552 --> 08:17.681
You, sir,
are not one of my vassals.

08:17.889 --> 08:20.100
Who are you ?

08:20.309 --> 08:23.061
Who wants to know ?

08:23.270 --> 08:25.230
I am Henry the Red,

08:25.439 --> 08:29.776
Duke of Shael, Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

08:29.985 --> 08:33.905
Well, hello,
Mr. Fancy Pants.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.950
I got news for you, pal. You ain't
leadin' but two things right now--

08:37.159 --> 08:39.995
Jack and shit,
and Jack left town.

08:40.203 --> 08:41.330
Shut your bleedin' hole !

08:41.538 --> 08:42.914
Shut your bleedin' hole !

08:43.123 --> 08:46.710
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur !

08:53.091 --> 08:56.553
There is an evil
awakened in this land,

08:56.762 --> 09:00.307
and while my people fight
for their very souls against it,

09:00.515 --> 09:03.310
you, Henry the Red,
wage war on us !

09:03.518 --> 09:07.522
Charlatan !
Aah !

09:07.731 --> 09:10.442
It was you who first turned
your swords on us !

09:10.651 --> 09:13.528
And this evil has befouled
my people as well !

09:13.737 --> 09:16.531
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...

09:16.740 --> 09:18.659
that lies in the bowels of that pit.

09:18.867 --> 09:21.620
Right, you're no better.

09:21.828 --> 09:24.164
May God
have mercy upon your souls.

09:38.303 --> 09:43.642
God's name !
What hell-spawned thing lurks there ?

09:47.562 --> 09:51.191
Into the pit with those
bloodthirsty sons of 'hores !

09:51.400 --> 09:55.612
No ! No !

09:55.737 --> 09:58.657
No, no ! Aah !

10:25.475 --> 10:29.521
Oh ! Heavenly God !

10:31.440 --> 10:33.483
He's escaping !

10:33.692 --> 10:37.362
- Hold to !
- Hold him !

11:07.476 --> 11:09.603
- Who's next ?
- It's him. Aye, he trembles !

11:09.811 --> 11:13.148
They don't look
so clever now, do they ?

11:13.357 --> 11:17.694
He's frightened !
He's frightened white !

11:17.903 --> 11:20.072
Whoa ! Whoa !

11:20.280 --> 11:23.033
Wait a minute. Hold it.

11:23.241 --> 11:27.621
W-Wait a minute.
You gotta understand, man.

11:27.829 --> 11:30.290
I never even saw
these assholes before.

11:30.499 --> 11:32.459
- Get him in there !
- He trembles !

11:32.668 --> 11:34.586
He's begging !

11:34.795 --> 11:37.255
- What are you waitin' for ?
- Henry !

11:37.464 --> 11:39.299
You gotta tell him
you don't know me.

11:39.508 --> 11:43.720
We never met.
Tell him.

11:44.680 --> 11:48.475
I do not think
he'll listen, lad.

11:48.684 --> 11:49.810
Look.

11:50.018 --> 11:54.773
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

12:03.365 --> 12:07.452
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

12:07.661 --> 12:11.248
Uh, wh-whoa.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.792
- Aah !

13:02.758 --> 13:06.970
How do you like the pit ?
Isn't the pit wonderful ?

13:20.108 --> 13:22.194
- Hai-ya !

13:22.402 --> 13:26.323
- Why, you--

13:26.740 --> 13:29.076
Ha !

13:29.284 --> 13:31.119
Spikes.

13:31.328 --> 13:35.791
Hey ! He says, "Spikes."
Give him spikes !

13:48.261 --> 13:52.557
Make way !
Strange one !

14:01.942 --> 14:05.279
- Strange one !

14:07.114 --> 14:10.659
Yaaah !

14:10.867 --> 14:14.746
Yes !

14:27.467 --> 14:30.679
Damn you.
Damn you !

15:55.305 --> 15:59.309
You know,
your shoelace is untied.

16:08.819 --> 16:11.363
All right.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.283
Who wants some ?

16:14.491 --> 16:17.953
Who's next, huh ?

16:18.161 --> 16:20.038
How 'bout it ?

16:20.247 --> 16:22.624
Who wants some, huh ?

16:22.833 --> 16:26.712
Who wants
to have a little ?

16:29.089 --> 16:34.011
You.
You want some more ?

16:34.386 --> 16:37.514
Huh ?

16:37.597 --> 16:41.268
You want a little ?

16:41.852 --> 16:44.563
Do ya ? Do ya ?
Do ya want some more?

16:44.771 --> 16:48.942
Huh ? Huh ?

17:01.288 --> 17:05.876
Now get on those horses
and get outta here.

17:07.961 --> 17:11.131
Let 'em go !

17:32.235 --> 17:34.988
- Halt !

17:35.197 --> 17:38.450
Thank you, generous hosts !

17:38.659 --> 17:42.079
Sword boy !

17:48.377 --> 17:53.465
For that arrogance,
I shall see you dead.

18:02.724 --> 18:04.643
Yeah.

18:04.851 --> 18:08.689
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

18:08.897 --> 18:11.066
See this ?

18:11.275 --> 18:15.946
- This is my boom stick !

18:16.154 --> 18:18.490
It's a 12-gauge,
double-barreled Remington.

18:18.699 --> 18:20.575
S-mart's
top of the line.

18:20.784 --> 18:23.704
You can find this in
the sporting goods department.

18:23.912 --> 18:27.207
That's right. This sweet baby
was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

18:27.416 --> 18:30.711
Retails for about $109.95.

18:30.919 --> 18:35.632
It's got a walnut stock,
cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger.

18:35.841 --> 18:39.136
That's right, shop smart.

18:39.344 --> 18:42.389
Shop S-mart.
You got that ?

18:42.597 --> 18:44.391
- Yes, sir. Right.
- Yes, sir.

18:44.599 --> 18:46.602
Now I swear,

18:46.810 --> 18:49.896
the next one
of you primates...

18:50.105 --> 18:53.775
even touches me--

19:20.469 --> 19:25.557
Now, let's talk about
how I get back home.

19:56.046 --> 19:58.590
I prithee to forgive me,
m'lord.

19:58.799 --> 20:01.468
I believed thee
one of Henry's men.

20:01.677 --> 20:05.681
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

20:06.348 --> 20:08.266
Blow.

20:10.727 --> 20:13.855
So what's the deal ?
Can you send me back or not ?

20:14.064 --> 20:16.608
Only the Necronomicon
has the power.

20:16.817 --> 20:18.944
An unholy book
which we also require.

20:19.152 --> 20:22.739
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

20:22.948 --> 20:26.743
Only you, The Promised One,
can quest for it.

20:26.952 --> 20:30.205
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit.

20:30.414 --> 20:35.627
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto, today, chop--

20:43.051 --> 20:46.596
- You shall die !

20:52.936 --> 20:56.523
You shall never obtain
the Necronomicon !

20:56.732 --> 21:01.028
We shall feast
upon your souls !

21:04.197 --> 21:07.993
Oh !

21:22.049 --> 21:26.178
- It's a trick. Get an axe.

21:30.766 --> 21:34.394
- Guards, stop it !

21:34.603 --> 21:37.064
- Catch the witch !
- Death to the witch !

21:37.272 --> 21:39.191
Have some porridge !

21:39.399 --> 21:42.569
Ah, my eyes ! I'm blind !
Oh, God, I'm blind !

21:44.780 --> 21:46.615
No, don't !

21:51.161 --> 21:53.956
Yo, she-bitch.

21:54.164 --> 21:56.917
- Let's go.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.710
Ya-hoo !

21:58.919 --> 22:01.088
Hee-ya !

22:01.296 --> 22:04.716
- Hee-ya !

22:18.438 --> 22:20.691
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites,

22:20.899 --> 22:23.568
all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.

22:23.777 --> 22:27.489
Now will thou
quest for the book ?

22:39.960 --> 22:43.547
That one.

23:02.149 --> 23:05.068
Hee-ya !

23:08.447 --> 23:11.825
Groovy.

23:23.128 --> 23:26.381
What's the matter ?
You raised in a barn ? Shut the door.

23:26.590 --> 23:31.803
Probably was raised in a barn
with all the other primitives.

23:39.144 --> 23:43.607
The wise men say that
thou art The Promised One.

23:45.651 --> 23:49.237
'Tis said that thou wilt journey
for the book to help us,

23:49.446 --> 23:51.698
and that thou wilt lead
our people against the evil.

23:51.907 --> 23:57.245
The only reason I'm going
to get the book is to get home.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.877
I believe that thou wilt be
leaving in the morning.

24:04.086 --> 24:06.129
Don't touch that, please.
Your primitive intellect...

24:06.338 --> 24:08.215
wouldn't understand
alloys and compositions...

24:08.423 --> 24:13.261
and things with
molecular structures in the--

24:14.262 --> 24:16.932
What are you
doin' here anyway ?

24:17.140 --> 24:19.643
I wanted to say
that all of my--

24:19.851 --> 24:22.187
all of my hopes and
prayers go with you,

24:22.396 --> 24:25.232
and I made this
for thee.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.860
Good, I could use
a horse blanket.

24:50.132 --> 24:53.677
Gimme some sugar, baby.

25:01.977 --> 25:06.565
Hyah ! Come on, boy !

25:06.940 --> 25:10.319
Hyah !

25:15.699 --> 25:19.703
Hyah !

25:26.126 --> 25:28.295
- Steady now. Whoa.

25:33.175 --> 25:35.636
What ? What is it ?

25:35.844 --> 25:38.430
This path will lead you
to an unholy place.

25:38.639 --> 25:43.936
A cemetery. There,
the Necronomicon awaits.

25:45.896 --> 25:49.983
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words,

25:50.192 --> 25:52.986
"Klaatu barada nikto."

25:53.195 --> 25:56.782
Klaatu barada nikto.
Okay.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.992
Well, repeat them.

25:59.201 --> 26:02.454
- Klaatu barada nikto.
- Again !

26:02.663 --> 26:05.999
I got it, I got it !
I know your damn words, all right ?

26:06.208 --> 26:08.710
Now you get this straight,
the both of you.

26:08.919 --> 26:11.797
If I get that book,
you send me back.

26:12.005 --> 26:14.299
After that,
I'm history. Hyah !

26:54.881 --> 26:56.758
What is it, boy ?

27:09.980 --> 27:12.858
Hyah ! Come on !

27:20.490 --> 27:23.452
Hyah ! Come on !

27:28.457 --> 27:31.376
Aah ! Come on !

27:31.585 --> 27:34.713
Come on, you !

29:18.525 --> 29:22.613
Hey, let's scare
this guy good ! Come on.

29:24.114 --> 29:26.116
Ramming speed !

29:30.621 --> 29:33.999
Ooh !

29:34.207 --> 29:37.002
Ready, aim, fire !

29:37.210 --> 29:39.880
- Ooh !
- Get away !

29:40.088 --> 29:42.007
Whoa !

29:42.215 --> 29:44.176
- Oh, God ! Oh, no !
- Oh--

29:44.384 --> 29:47.596
- Oh !
- You lousy little--

29:47.804 --> 29:49.890
Oh, no !

29:50.098 --> 29:51.683
Ooh, no ! Oh, my !

29:51.892 --> 29:54.186
Uh, ooh, aah !

29:54.394 --> 29:58.106
- Lift up !
- Oh, ooh-hoo-ha !

29:58.315 --> 30:02.361
- Ooh, aah !

30:04.696 --> 30:07.824
Aah-ha-ha !

30:13.789 --> 30:17.042
Heh heh heh-heh--
Whoa !

30:17.376 --> 30:19.461
## London Bridge
is falling down #

30:19.670 --> 30:22.547
# Falling down #

30:22.756 --> 30:25.550
# Falling down #

30:25.759 --> 30:28.470
- # My fair lady ## Ha !

30:32.808 --> 30:39.064
Ooh !

30:39.982 --> 30:41.817
Is he up ?
How is he ?

30:42.025 --> 30:45.570
Hey,
he's gettin' up.

30:49.283 --> 30:54.538
Hmm,
what a horrible nightmare.

30:54.913 --> 30:59.042
Wait a minute.
Oh, God !

30:59.251 --> 31:01.128
I can't move !

31:01.336 --> 31:06.967
Aah !

31:07.801 --> 31:10.345
- And go !
- Open wide.

31:10.554 --> 31:16.935
Geronimo !

31:17.311 --> 31:19.146
- Hooray !
- Hooray !

31:42.669 --> 31:45.005
- Ah !

31:45.213 --> 31:49.468
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate, huh ?

32:00.187 --> 32:02.940
How'd you like
the taste of that, huh ?

32:03.148 --> 32:05.067
How'd you like the ta--

32:08.946 --> 32:11.531
Aah, uh, ugh, oh !

32:11.740 --> 32:15.452
Ah ! Oh !

32:15.619 --> 32:19.623
Let me out !

32:21.750 --> 32:25.504
Oh, dear God,
it's growing bigger !

32:41.561 --> 32:45.899
Ooh, ooh, I'm blind.
I'm blind. Bleh.

32:49.569 --> 32:52.864
Yip, yip, yah !

32:53.073 --> 32:58.537
Oh, hey ! Where are you takin' me ?
Uh, oh, ooh !

33:04.167 --> 33:06.586
What are you ?

33:06.795 --> 33:09.089
Are you me ?

33:09.298 --> 33:12.718
I'm bad Ash,
and you're good Ash.

33:12.926 --> 33:14.761
You're goody
little two-shoes.

33:14.970 --> 33:18.974
## You're goody little two-shoes
goody little two-shoes #

33:19.182 --> 33:21.768
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

33:21.977 --> 33:26.648
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

33:26.857 --> 33:30.360
- Ow !

33:31.028 --> 33:32.904
# Little goody two-shoes ##

33:36.992 --> 33:40.495
Aah !

33:44.499 --> 33:50.088
Good, bad.
I'm the guy with the gun.

34:49.856 --> 34:55.487
That'll teach you.
Yeah, that'll teach you.

34:56.237 --> 34:58.699
You shall never retrieve
the Necronomicon !

34:58.907 --> 35:01.994
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it !

35:02.202 --> 35:06.832
- What's that you got on your face ?
- Huh ?

35:07.040 --> 35:10.752
I'll come back for you !

35:16.133 --> 35:20.846
- Hyah !

35:21.013 --> 35:24.516
Come on, boy !

35:31.773 --> 35:35.527
Hyah !

36:40.133 --> 36:43.720
Three books ?

36:46.640 --> 36:48.934
Wait a minute.
Hold it.

36:49.142 --> 36:53.647
Nobody said anything
about three books.

36:53.855 --> 36:55.649
L-Like what
am I supposed to do ?

36:55.857 --> 37:02.406
Take one book,
or all books, or, or what ?

37:03.073 --> 37:06.118
Well.

37:58.420 --> 38:02.841
Whoa. Wrong book.

38:37.501 --> 38:39.419
Ow !

38:44.925 --> 38:46.760
Aah ! Ooh !

38:56.270 --> 38:59.022
Ooh ! Ooh, you !

38:59.231 --> 39:02.943
I'll get back to you.

39:03.318 --> 39:04.152
Well...

39:04.361 --> 39:05.445
Well...

39:05.654 --> 39:09.074
seems fairly obvious.

39:11.702 --> 39:17.291
Ooh, wait a minute. The words.
All right, all right, all right.

39:17.499 --> 39:20.919
Say the words.

39:23.130 --> 39:26.300
Klaatu... barada...

39:26.508 --> 39:30.053
Iu--

39:34.558 --> 39:36.393
necktie.

39:36.602 --> 39:39.646
Nectar, n-- nickel.

39:39.855 --> 39:42.441
Noodle.
It's an "N" word.

39:42.649 --> 39:46.737
It's definitely
an "N" word.

39:47.571 --> 39:51.325
It's definitely
an "N" word.

40:01.501 --> 40:06.298
Klaatu barada n--

40:20.312 --> 40:25.150
Okay, then.
That's it.

40:34.826 --> 40:37.329
Hey. Wait a minute.

40:37.537 --> 40:41.667
Everything's cool.
I said the words. I did !

40:41.875 --> 40:47.506
- Oh ! Oh ! No, wait ! Oh !

40:53.095 --> 40:57.432
You people, seek cover !
To the parapet !

40:57.641 --> 40:59.559
Seek your children !

40:59.768 --> 41:03.230
- Steady the horses !

41:03.438 --> 41:07.025
Something's wrong.
Something's amiss.

41:38.932 --> 41:42.936
Where'd you go ?
Where'd you g--

42:05.792 --> 42:08.587
Oh, oh, aah !

42:10.797 --> 42:12.758
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

42:15.719 --> 42:21.099
Ow ! I'll crush ya !
I'll mash ya into paste, you bony cre--

42:41.119 --> 42:44.539
- Hyah !

42:45.374 --> 42:48.794
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part.

42:49.002 --> 42:52.631
Now I want back,
like in the deal. Hyah !

43:03.850 --> 43:07.187
I... live...

43:09.022 --> 43:10.983
again.

43:21.076 --> 43:24.871
There ! The Promised One !
The Promised One's returned !

43:25.080 --> 43:29.751
Raise the portcullis !

43:31.503 --> 43:37.009
Welcome home !
We're saved !

43:37.217 --> 43:41.221
- The Necronomicon !
- Truly he is The Promised One !

43:41.430 --> 43:43.890
- He's brought the Necronomicon !
- How are ya ?

43:44.099 --> 43:47.060
- He's brought the book !
- Yeah, great, great.

43:47.269 --> 43:49.146
- Good boy !
- Get the fuck outta my face !

43:55.611 --> 44:00.532
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon ?

44:00.657 --> 44:04.620
- Yeah, it's, it's just that--
- Just what ?

44:04.661 --> 44:08.373
Nothin'.
Here.

44:12.753 --> 44:16.298
Now send me back.
Like in the deal.

44:16.506 --> 44:21.345
When you removed the Necronomicon from
the cradle, did you speak the words ?

44:21.553 --> 44:24.222
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words ?

44:24.431 --> 44:27.017
Look, maybe I didn't say every
single, little tiny syllable,

44:27.225 --> 44:30.145
- no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
- Dung-eating fool !

44:30.354 --> 44:33.982
Thou hast doomed us all !
When thou misspoke the words,

44:34.191 --> 44:36.109
the army
of the dead awoke !

44:36.318 --> 44:38.528
Now, whoa, whoa,
right there, spinach chin.

44:38.737 --> 44:41.823
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.

44:42.032 --> 44:45.494
You said there was a passage that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.

44:45.702 --> 44:48.080
It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back,

44:48.288 --> 44:50.082
but to us
it is useless !

44:50.290 --> 44:52.751
The evil has a terrible hunger
for the Necronomicon,

44:52.960 --> 44:55.754
and it will come here
to get it.

44:55.963 --> 44:58.507
We had a deal.

44:58.715 --> 45:01.426
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for ya.

45:01.635 --> 45:03.595
I did my part,
now you send me back.

45:03.804 --> 45:06.348
Very well.
As we are men of our word,

45:06.556 --> 45:10.394
we shall honor
our bargain.

45:10.602 --> 45:14.481
The wise men shall return you
to your own time.

45:14.690 --> 45:16.441
Yeah ?

45:16.650 --> 45:18.819
- I thought he was the one.
- Yeah, right.

45:19.027 --> 45:20.904
'Cause that
was the deal.

45:21.113 --> 45:23.448
So when do you think
we can...

45:23.657 --> 45:26.451
start with all
the thing and the--

45:26.660 --> 45:28.495
He's nothin'
but a traitor, he is !

45:28.704 --> 45:30.497
When do you
think we can start...

45:30.706 --> 45:34.126
with all the, uh,
ceremony and, uh--

45:34.334 --> 45:36.169
Agh ! Wretched excuse
for a man !

45:36.378 --> 45:41.133
The wise men were fools
to trust in you.

45:41.341 --> 45:43.135
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

45:43.343 --> 45:46.013
We put our trust in him.

45:46.221 --> 45:48.974
I still believe
that thou wilt help us.

45:49.182 --> 45:54.605
Oh, Sheila,
don't you get it ? It's over.

45:54.605 --> 45:58.567
I didn't have
what it took.

45:58.859 --> 46:02.404
So long.

46:04.615 --> 46:06.408
But what of the things
that we've shared ?

46:06.617 --> 46:09.995
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private ?

46:10.203 --> 46:12.664
Aw, well--

46:12.873 --> 46:16.877
Well, that's just what we call
"pillow talk," baby. That's all.

46:17.085 --> 46:20.505
It was more than that.

46:20.839 --> 46:23.342
I still have faith
in thee.

46:23.550 --> 46:28.639
I still believe that thou
wilt stay and save us. I--

46:32.392 --> 46:36.146
Coward !

46:37.105 --> 46:39.066
- Look there ! A demon !

46:55.582 --> 46:58.585
Ash ! Help me !

46:58.794 --> 47:01.296
Sheila !

47:04.967 --> 47:08.470
Yaaah !

47:12.140 --> 47:16.603
- Shoot the bloody thing !
- Hold your arms ! You'll hit the girl !

47:21.066 --> 47:24.653
Uh, me sword !

47:24.778 --> 47:27.447
Yaaah !

47:27.656 --> 47:29.241
Damn you !

47:47.509 --> 47:52.222
Dig, damn you !
Dig faster !

47:52.431 --> 47:55.434
I shall command every
worm-infested son-of-a-bitch...

47:55.642 --> 47:57.436
- that ever died in battle !
- Thank you, sir !

47:57.644 --> 47:59.688
- You there, handsomely now.
- Aye, my liege.

47:59.896 --> 48:02.316
We shall storm their castle
and get my book !

48:02.524 --> 48:06.778
Hoist,
you damnable varlets !

48:09.531 --> 48:13.160
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

48:13.368 --> 48:16.955
Now pick up a shovel
and get digging !

48:17.164 --> 48:22.252
- Bring on the wench !

48:32.262 --> 48:37.434
- Gimme some sugar, baby.

48:37.434 --> 48:39.978
Well.

48:40.187 --> 48:44.566
Now, ain't you
a sweet little thing ?

48:44.775 --> 48:47.194
Don't touch me,
you foul thing !

48:47.402 --> 48:49.571
Come on.

48:49.780 --> 48:53.492
That's it.

48:54.952 --> 48:58.997
We got plans for you, girly-girl.
Move !

48:59.539 --> 49:03.377
Have you lost your bones,
you decomposed gobs ? Get thee hence !

49:12.427 --> 49:15.847
A scout approaches !

49:20.894 --> 49:23.855
- Whoa !
- Hey, get his horse.

49:24.064 --> 49:25.857
Arise.

49:26.066 --> 49:27.901
My lord, an army of the dead
gather in the wilderness.

49:28.110 --> 49:30.362
- They approach the castle.
- How far from here?

49:30.570 --> 49:31.905
But two days' ride.

49:32.114 --> 49:33.991
These winged ones
are only the first of them.

49:34.199 --> 49:36.034
Perhaps we should leave
as soon as possible.

49:36.243 --> 49:38.036
- We could be safe in the mountains.
- Yes, the mountains.

49:38.245 --> 49:40.622
- We must flee !
- It is written. It has been foretold.

49:40.831 --> 49:43.000
- They'll take our souls.
They'll swallow our souls.
- I'm afraid !

49:43.208 --> 49:46.336
- I don't want to die !

49:46.545 --> 49:50.882
That's it.
Go ahead and run.

49:51.091 --> 49:53.885
Run home
and cry to mama !

49:54.094 --> 49:59.391
Me ?
I'm through runnin' !

50:00.017 --> 50:03.228
I say we stay here
and fight it out.

50:03.437 --> 50:07.858
Are all men from
the future loudmouthed braggarts ?

50:08.066 --> 50:12.904
Nope. Just me, baby.
Just me.

50:13.113 --> 50:17.451
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls ?

50:17.659 --> 50:20.329
How will you fight that ?
More words ?

50:20.537 --> 50:22.331
Most of our people
have already fled.

50:22.539 --> 50:25.125
We are but 60 men.

50:25.334 --> 50:30.255
Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.

50:31.465 --> 50:37.346
Now... who's with me ?

50:50.400 --> 50:53.946
I'll stand by ya.

50:54.404 --> 50:56.657
You can count on my steel.

50:56.865 --> 50:58.700
I'll offer up my courage.

50:58.909 --> 51:02.454
- Me sword's by his side.
- I'm with you !

51:02.663 --> 51:05.123
- I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.
- And mine !

51:07.459 --> 51:09.586
We'll stay !

51:09.795 --> 51:12.798
Hail ! Hail !
Hail ! Hail !

51:13.006 --> 51:19.805
Hail ! Hail ! Hail !

51:27.437 --> 51:29.314
Well, my dear,

51:29.523 --> 51:33.610
say hello to the boys.

51:36.780 --> 51:42.119
- There's a sight for sore bones.

51:44.830 --> 51:47.207
I may be bad,

51:47.416 --> 51:50.711
but I feel... good.

51:50.919 --> 51:53.547
- Who rules ?
- To you, my lord.

51:53.755 --> 51:55.590
You, sir. To the castle.

51:55.799 --> 51:59.303
The castle !

52:00.053 --> 52:01.930
Hurry up now.

52:02.139 --> 52:04.516
The castle ! Let's push.

52:04.725 --> 52:09.104
Heave-ho.
Good. Yeah.

53:07.120 --> 53:09.039
Ha ! Hoo !

53:09.247 --> 53:11.041
Hai-ya !

53:11.249 --> 53:14.461
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

53:14.670 --> 53:18.090
Yeah !

53:18.340 --> 53:23.679
They're coming !
The Deadites approach !

53:39.569 --> 53:43.115
There's so damn
many of 'em.

53:44.700 --> 53:46.660
Maybe--

53:46.868 --> 53:51.873
Just maybe my boys can stop 'em
from gettin' the book.

53:55.085 --> 53:56.920
Yeah.

53:57.129 --> 53:59.589
And maybe
I'm a Chinese jet pilot.

54:32.873 --> 54:36.835
Battle stations ! All right, get those
rocks up, mister, on the double !

54:37.044 --> 54:43.300
Ready the catapults !
By God, let's give 'em what for.

54:50.766 --> 54:52.559
And halt !

54:52.768 --> 54:57.814
- Company, halt !
- Company, halt !

55:03.570 --> 55:06.365
I'll rip his balls off.

55:38.939 --> 55:43.318
Bring forth the scout !

55:43.610 --> 55:45.570
Whoa.

55:45.779 --> 55:48.532
My lord, we are positioned
on both fronts.

55:48.740 --> 55:52.077
Fine, fine, fine.
Where are they keeping my book ?

55:52.286 --> 55:55.080
There, my lord,
beyond the wall.

55:55.289 --> 55:58.500
The parapet. That would be
the most likely place.

55:58.709 --> 56:03.088
Right. Bring me forth
into that castle !

56:03.297 --> 56:06.091
- Forward !
- Forward !

56:06.300 --> 56:11.096
Cry havoc and let loose
the dogs of war !

56:11.305 --> 56:13.890
To the castle !

56:14.099 --> 56:17.561
Fly, mate ! Fly !

56:17.769 --> 56:22.065
Death to the mortals !

56:23.317 --> 56:24.443
Arrows.

56:24.651 --> 56:28.280
Torch boy !

57:02.147 --> 57:04.983
Steady.

57:10.364 --> 57:13.951
Fire !

57:15.035 --> 57:20.123
- Advance, you beasts, advance !

57:27.381 --> 57:31.510
Oh ! Oh !

57:32.928 --> 57:37.140
Yeah, baby !

57:40.519 --> 57:44.564
- All right !

57:44.773 --> 57:49.027
Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.

57:49.236 --> 57:53.699
Ram the gate !

57:56.410 --> 57:57.911
Catapults.

57:58.120 --> 58:00.247
Catapults out !

58:08.422 --> 58:10.757
Yeah !

58:10.966 --> 58:14.886
Fire !

58:18.473 --> 58:21.268
Look there !

58:25.147 --> 58:28.108
Yeah !

58:28.317 --> 58:31.653
- Seek cover !
- Watch out !

58:31.862 --> 58:35.407
- Make way !

58:44.249 --> 58:46.084
Oh !

58:46.293 --> 58:48.920
Oh, you miserable
bags of bones !

58:49.129 --> 58:51.965
Pick yourselves up
and sally fo...

58:54.176 --> 58:56.136
Sally for--

58:56.345 --> 58:59.806
Sally forth.

59:02.059 --> 59:04.561
Come on,
you miserable wretches.

59:04.770 --> 59:07.272
Lower.

59:07.481 --> 59:11.652
Heave !

59:15.322 --> 59:18.951
Forward !

59:19.159 --> 59:23.413
Buttress the door, now !

59:32.381 --> 59:36.468
Hold fast !

59:38.387 --> 59:40.973
- Back !
- Stone these creatures !

59:41.181 --> 59:44.935
Damn you !

59:45.852 --> 59:47.854
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

59:48.063 --> 59:50.482
Go, you creatures !
Arrows !

59:50.691 --> 59:54.111
Load !
Fire !

59:56.697 --> 01:00:00.033
- Heave ! Put your...

01:00:00.242 --> 01:00:03.370
backbones into it.

01:00:03.578 --> 01:00:05.831
We've broken through !
The castle is ours !

01:00:11.253 --> 01:00:15.841
Kill the mortals !

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:21.596
- Get it achieved and fast !

01:00:35.068 --> 01:00:39.114
Their ranks are broken !
Have at them !

01:00:39.406 --> 01:00:44.411
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

01:00:49.708 --> 01:00:52.711
Pull back !
Man the parapet !

01:00:52.919 --> 01:00:54.713
Protect the book.

01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:58.675
God save us all.

01:01:02.137 --> 01:01:05.182
Say hello
to the 21st century. Yeah !

01:01:17.945 --> 01:01:21.198
Come on !
I got plenty for everybody !

01:01:21.406 --> 01:01:23.533
Look out !

01:01:23.742 --> 01:01:26.536
- Whoo !

01:01:29.247 --> 01:01:33.210
- Bye-bye.

01:01:33.794 --> 01:01:37.464
It's the one in the cart we want !
Get him !

01:01:37.673 --> 01:01:42.094
- Yaaah !

01:01:47.849 --> 01:01:49.601
Yaaaaah !

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.459
Sheila ?

01:02:36.815 --> 01:02:39.526
- We've secured the courtyard, my lord.

01:02:39.735 --> 01:02:43.155
Excellent.

01:02:54.499 --> 01:02:57.961
Ooh ! Hey ! Look out !

01:03:03.508 --> 01:03:06.470
- Hey, you're mine, sweetie.

01:03:06.678 --> 01:03:10.098
Get off of her !

01:03:12.768 --> 01:03:14.561
Gotcha !

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:18.148
Damn you !

01:03:19.733 --> 01:03:22.736
- My lord.
- Stay with the book.

01:03:22.945 --> 01:03:27.199
The book's where we are.

01:03:28.617 --> 01:03:33.997
The Red ! The Red !
Duke Henry and his men have come !

01:03:35.165 --> 01:03:37.793
Blows, blood...

01:03:38.001 --> 01:03:42.339
and death !

01:03:44.299 --> 01:03:46.593
Duke Henry ! Ha-ha !

01:03:52.224 --> 01:03:56.019
Die !

01:03:56.979 --> 01:04:02.025
Onward, valiant cousins !
Their ranks are broke !

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:10.075
Oops !

01:04:10.284 --> 01:04:14.538
Hello !

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.586
There ya go.

01:04:21.795 --> 01:04:25.465
The book is mine.

01:04:33.307 --> 01:04:35.434
I'll cut your gizzard out.

01:04:35.642 --> 01:04:39.062
- Hey, where'd he go ?

01:04:48.196 --> 01:04:51.033
Come to papa.

01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:54.745
Get him !

01:05:19.478 --> 01:05:22.356
Oh, you crazy bitch,
get off of me !

01:05:22.564 --> 01:05:25.984
Ha !

01:05:28.695 --> 01:05:32.115
Right.

01:05:36.745 --> 01:05:39.539
You found me beautiful once.

01:05:39.748 --> 01:05:42.960
Honey, you got real ugly.

01:05:59.935 --> 01:06:03.355
There we are.

01:06:09.861 --> 01:06:12.531
So you wanna
play rough, eh ?

01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:16.785
Okay.

01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:22.207
Oh.

01:06:22.749 --> 01:06:27.212
All right, all right.

01:06:28.005 --> 01:06:32.342
Prepare to die !

01:06:44.104 --> 01:06:46.690
You're going down !

01:06:46.898 --> 01:06:50.819
- I'm goin' up.
- I'm comin' for ya.

01:06:58.285 --> 01:07:02.664
Come on !

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.637
- Oops. Excuse me.
- Come on.

01:07:16.845 --> 01:07:19.765
All right !

01:07:19.973 --> 01:07:25.145
You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch !

01:07:42.663 --> 01:07:46.625
I'll spoil
those good looks.

01:07:46.667 --> 01:07:50.462
Back-stabber !

01:07:52.923 --> 01:07:56.301
Hold still !

01:08:06.311 --> 01:08:08.772
Tallyho !

01:08:10.399 --> 01:08:13.819
- We can't hold the battlements!

01:08:14.027 --> 01:08:16.947
We will hold !
We must protect the book !

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:31.252
I got a bone
to pick with you.

01:08:31.461 --> 01:08:35.465
Come on.

01:08:40.178 --> 01:08:43.682
Slice that gizzard open.

01:08:58.613 --> 01:09:02.451
Now you're mine.

01:09:02.908 --> 01:09:07.288
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:09:21.803 --> 01:09:25.849
At last, the book.

01:09:29.645 --> 01:09:31.854
I possess the Necronomicon.

01:09:32.064 --> 01:09:35.567
I've crushed your pathetic army.
Now I'll have my vengeance.

01:09:35.776 --> 01:09:39.404
Buckle up, bonehead,
'cause you're goin' for a ride.

01:09:39.613 --> 01:09:43.325
Huh ?

01:09:54.336 --> 01:09:59.049
Victory's ours !

01:09:59.591 --> 01:10:05.097
- Retreat ! Retreat !
- Let's get the hell out of here !

01:10:29.913 --> 01:10:31.707
- Oh.
- Tricky ones, they are.

01:10:31.915 --> 01:10:34.126
If it's a fight you want--

01:10:34.334 --> 01:10:39.256
Watch 'em, lads.
They're an untrust worthy lot.

01:11:24.551 --> 01:11:26.386
Move yourself, lad !

01:11:26.595 --> 01:11:28.597
- Your hand, man. Godspeed !
- Hey, Henry. Yeah, nice goin'.

01:11:28.805 --> 01:11:30.599
- My lady.
- Arthur.

01:11:30.807 --> 01:11:33.894
- Well won, my friend.
- We've won the day.

01:11:34.102 --> 01:11:37.648
- Yeah !
- Yeah !

01:11:40.776 --> 01:11:46.323
We're brothers
and a new kingdom shall be born !

01:11:47.783 --> 01:11:50.869
The book tells us that
once you drink this liquid...

01:11:51.078 --> 01:11:55.207
and recite the words,
"Klaatu barada nikto,"

01:11:55.415 --> 01:11:59.711
thou shalt awaken
in thine own time.

01:12:00.253 --> 01:12:06.009
Remember, you must
recite the words exactly.

01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:38.750
Hyah !

01:12:56.643 --> 01:12:58.687
I thought about staying.

01:12:58.895 --> 01:13:03.483
They offered me the chance to lead them,
to teach them, to-- to be king.

01:13:03.692 --> 01:13:06.612
- Uh-huh.
- But my place is here.

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:11.283
- So I swallowed the juice,
said the words and here I am.
- Did you say...

01:13:11.491 --> 01:13:14.036
the words
right this time ?

01:13:14.244 --> 01:13:17.331
Well, maybe I didn't say every
single, tiny little syllable, no,

01:13:17.539 --> 01:13:21.251
but basically
I said 'em, yeah.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.921
Basically.

01:13:26.214 --> 01:13:28.925
You know that story about
how you could've been king ?

01:13:29.134 --> 01:13:32.095
I, uh, I think
it's kind of cute.

01:13:32.304 --> 01:13:36.516
Yeah.

01:13:53.659 --> 01:13:58.163
- Die !

01:14:09.091 --> 01:14:12.386
Lady, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave the store.

01:14:12.594 --> 01:14:14.888
Who the hell are you ?

01:14:15.097 --> 01:14:17.724
Name's Ash.

01:14:17.933 --> 01:14:19.851
Housewares.

01:14:40.289 --> 01:14:43.083
I'll swallow your soul.

01:14:43.292 --> 01:14:47.462
Come get some.

01:15:04.771 --> 01:15:09.026
Sure, I could've
stayed in the past.

01:15:09.234 --> 01:15:12.904
Could've even been king.

01:15:13.113 --> 01:15:15.657
But in my own way,

01:15:15.866 --> 01:15:18.869
I am king.

01:15:19.077 --> 01:15:22.748
Hail to the king, baby.
