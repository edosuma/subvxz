01:36.430 --> 01:40.184
Hey, darling.
Two Bacardi mojitos and a gin and tonic.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.186
Lemon or lime?

01:42.186 --> 01:44.646
Lime.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.648
Where you from?

01:46.648 --> 01:49.109
<i>Lisboa. That's in Portugal.</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:53.113
But you got your tan in Miami?

01:59.328 --> 02:01.371
What's your name?

02:01.371 --> 02:05.375
-Rita.
-Rita. Sonny.

02:08.753 --> 02:12.716
See you later, Rita.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.801
Hey, Michael.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.386
-Neptune.
-Here are your dates.

02:57.386 --> 03:00.222
Hey, baby.

03:00.222 --> 03:04.142
Here you go.

03:04.142 --> 03:07.354
-Let me hit you now.
-No, no, no. Please, put it away.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.856
-Be cool.
-Come on.

03:08.856 --> 03:12.860
Hit me later.

03:17.322 --> 03:21.285
What's with number three?

03:24.371 --> 03:28.375
She's sick, man.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.212
That's cool. I'll go with two.

03:32.212 --> 03:36.216
Let's go, sweetheart.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.533
Do you know how much
I'm losing tonight?

04:42.533 --> 04:44.243
No.

04:52.209 --> 04:56.213
Where you going?

05:10.602 --> 05:14.565
Easy. Easy.

05:18.277 --> 05:20.988
Neptune should ease up
on the merchandise.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.992
Flip the girls upstairs and we got him.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.702
His day will come.

05:28.787 --> 05:32.791
Hello?

05:34.793 --> 05:38.797
Hello?

05:38.922 --> 05:39.965
Hello?

05:39.965 --> 05:43.969
-Yeah. Who's this?

05:47.639 --> 05:48.765
Sonny?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.434
Alonzo?

05:50.434 --> 05:53.353
Alonzo, I can't talk.
We're in the middle of a deal right now.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.273
Take care of Leonetta for me.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.318
Ask Ricardo to do that.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.486
<i>I gave up nothing on you.</i>

06:01.486 --> 06:05.490
They're on their own.
It's all their deal, anyway. Fuck them.

06:07.451 --> 06:10.370
Alonzo, what are you talking about?

06:10.370 --> 06:13.332
I'm falling by the house,

06:13.332 --> 06:14.917
and then I'm gone.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.669
So whatever you can do for her,
okay, Sonny?

06:17.669 --> 06:21.590
Alonzo.

06:21.590 --> 06:25.511
Goodbye.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.763
-What is it?
-Alonzo Stevens.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.515
Something's wrong.

06:29.515 --> 06:33.477
He told you to look after Leonetta for him.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.858
FBI Miami.

06:39.858 --> 06:43.820
This is Detective Crockett, Miami-Dade PD.
Patch me through to your SAC.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.293
<i>Leonetta, it's Rico.</i>

06:58.293 --> 07:02.297
<i>Give me a call back
as soon as you get a chance.</i>

07:15.727 --> 07:18.105
This is ASAC John Fujima.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.398
Detective Crockett.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.650
What's your Miami-Dade badge number
and date of birth?

07:21.650 --> 07:24.653
447-Charlie-1292.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.698
-447-Charlie-1292.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.033
Bobby G., it's Rico.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.996
Hey, that transponder we had
on Alonzo Stevens' Bentley, it still running?

07:33.996 --> 07:35.664
<i>When's the last time we used it?</i>

07:35.664 --> 07:39.668
I don't know.
We ain't worked him in six months.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.378
Okay. So?

07:41.378 --> 07:43.630
<i>may be going bad.</i>

07:43.630 --> 07:46.758
Confidential informant
we cut loose to you guys.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.887
CI's name is Alonzo Stevens. He called us.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.139
We haven't spoken to him in six months.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.558
How do I discuss this over
an open phone line?

07:54.558 --> 07:56.560
How the hell do I know?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.645
We got the phone call from Alonzo
on an open line.

07:58.645 --> 08:02.649
That is the hand we have been dealt
at 11:47 on Saturday night.

08:03.609 --> 08:06.820
Now, I do not know what case
you have him on, but whatever it is,

08:06.820 --> 08:10.824
it is going bad, and it sounds like
it is going bad right now.

08:22.419 --> 08:26.423
It's a preliminary meet and greet.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.720
<i>You flash me yours, I'll flash you mine?</i>

08:32.846 --> 08:34.806
-Ricardo Tubbs.
-My partner.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.684
Yeah, deal goes down another time,
another place.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.980
<i>-So, what? No HRT weapons team out there?
-That's right.</i>

08:41.980 --> 08:43.148
Colombians? Russians?

08:43.148 --> 08:45.108
White supremacists.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.903
And that tape
is not gonna look good in court.

08:47.903 --> 08:50.656
Aryan Brotherhood? Mongols?
Nazi Low Riders? What?

08:50.656 --> 08:54.618
We think Aryan Brotherhood,
but we don't know for sure.

08:56.411 --> 08:59.122
-What's up?
-Get Michael out of there.

08:59.122 --> 09:03.126
-What about Neptune?
-It's Neptune's lucky night.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.547
What else did Stevens tell you?

09:06.547 --> 09:10.551
He said that it went bad,
that he didn't give us up. Told us goodbye.

09:18.559 --> 09:22.563
<i>Hey, he just got on the 95 southbound
from the 195 causeway.</i>

09:45.169 --> 09:49.173
We got meth, ice, glass, Es, Ks, ex,

09:49.256 --> 09:52.217
Mitsus, Ames, Colombian H.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.888
Ice.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.848
Party down with the coke.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.770
Not like that jumped-on powder
they sell up in Nuyorico.

10:09.568 --> 10:13.572
Never seen green?

10:24.750 --> 10:28.712
You got the green. We got the goods.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.506
We party.

10:30.506 --> 10:34.510
Larry'll call you in the a.m.
about quantity and money, time and place.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.769
Hey, Ivan!

10:43.769 --> 10:47.773
My brother.

10:50.692 --> 10:54.696
How long have you been working
with the FBI?

11:30.649 --> 11:34.611
Alonzo, pull over!

11:35.737 --> 11:39.741
Pull over!

11:47.833 --> 11:49.001
Stay back!

11:49.001 --> 11:52.004
What'd you do?

11:52.004 --> 11:55.883
I fronted their undercover team
to these guys like usual, you know?

11:55.883 --> 11:58.677
They're Feds, Russian speakers.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.846
I was the middleman.

12:00.846 --> 12:04.808
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, to set up the meet.

12:07.686 --> 12:11.648
They grabbed Leonetta.

12:14.276 --> 12:18.280
They took Leonetta.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.327
I gave them up, man.

12:23.327 --> 12:27.331
Gave up the Feds. Everything.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.752
Everything I knew. Rico, I got to go home.

12:31.752 --> 12:35.756
Got people there now.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.969
-How did they get onto you, Alonzo?
-How the hell do I know?

12:40.969 --> 12:44.973
They knew one Russian was FBI
from the get-go, so...

12:45.140 --> 12:48.393
They knew I knew.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.730
-Rico, I gotta go.
Alonzo. Alonzo.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.362
-Rico, I got to go. I got to go.
-Alonzo. Alonzo!

12:58.362 --> 13:02.366
-I gotta fucking go!
-Hello?

13:13.043 --> 13:17.047
You don't...

13:18.757 --> 13:22.344
You don't...

13:22.344 --> 13:26.348
You don't need to go home.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.020
They said they wouldn't hurt her, man.

13:32.020 --> 13:36.024
They lied.

13:53.250 --> 13:57.212
-Alonzo!
-No!

14:04.761 --> 14:07.723
Prints on the fridge.

14:07.723 --> 14:11.727
Hold on.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.065
Yeah.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.984
<i>What's your QTH?</i>

14:18.984 --> 14:21.987
Just a couple blocks away.
We can see the lights.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.155
Turn around.

14:23.155 --> 14:26.742
Turn around? Look, we know these people.

14:26.742 --> 14:30.746
Meet me in 15 minutes, Standard Park.

14:56.355 --> 14:59.316
-What the hell just happened?
What was that?

14:59.316 --> 15:00.776
Who's this?

15:00.776 --> 15:04.071
He needs to talk to you.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.115
I'm Fujima. We talked on the phone.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.993
-So, this was your operation?
-Yes, at command level.

15:09.993 --> 15:13.372
We trusted our informant, Alonzo, to you,
and you got his whole family killed?

15:13.372 --> 15:15.541
What, did you jump some amateurs
into a game they ain't ready for?

15:15.541 --> 15:17.918
-What the fuck happened, man?
-Three men got killed!

15:17.918 --> 15:21.922
And so did our...
-Cool down.

15:25.467 --> 15:29.471
They discovered my guys were undercover,
and we don't know how.

15:31.306 --> 15:35.310
This was an interagency task force,
DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs.

15:36.061 --> 15:39.439
The leak could have come
from any one unit.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.401
I gotta assume
my operational security is compromised.

15:42.401 --> 15:46.405
Compromised? Your whole op sec is blown.
You're stone cold dead in the water.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.618
Meanwhile, it does not track.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.537
White supremacist gang?

15:53.537 --> 15:57.082
White prison gangs is tweakers
and meth labs and trailer parks.

15:57.082 --> 16:00.085
Bouncing the old lady around
until they get busted back.

16:00.085 --> 16:04.047
And how did they get all high tech
with sophisticated counterintel?

16:05.632 --> 16:08.635
And what we here
talking to you for, anyway?

16:08.635 --> 16:12.639
Miami-Dade wasn't part of the task force.

16:13.515 --> 16:14.892
Oh.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.518
They don't know you.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.396
So, you want to recruit us?

16:19.396 --> 16:21.857
Identify them. Who are they?

16:21.857 --> 16:25.861
-How did they cut into us?
-How do we cut into them?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.281
How do we get
all close and personal with them?

16:29.281 --> 16:32.201
Make a buy. That worked well.

16:32.201 --> 16:35.120
Sell to them? We supply them?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.122
No, they got a steady stream of supply.

16:37.122 --> 16:40.000
Colombian named José Yero,
midlevel trafficker.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.462
Okay. So what about Yero?
Can we get to them through Yero?

16:43.462 --> 16:44.922
Possible.
-What does he need?

16:44.922 --> 16:46.965
-Money laundering? Transpo?
Transpo.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.676
He outsources his transportation.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.637
Okay.

16:51.637 --> 16:55.641
Do we run an undercover on José Yero?

16:57.017 --> 17:00.270
So we transport a load for Yero
into this group?

17:00.270 --> 17:03.982
So can we run a load for Yero
into this group? It's a question.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.108
He transships out of Haiti.

17:06.108 --> 17:10.113
Flies his product in from Colombia,
hires someone to run it from Haiti into here.

17:13.659 --> 17:17.621
This is a FLIR image of someone's
go-fast boats running in a Yero load.

17:19.498 --> 17:23.417
AWAC shot it.

17:23.417 --> 17:27.422
That's all we got.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.344
All right. If they do this,

17:32.344 --> 17:36.348
I'd like them deputized as federal under
OCDETF for the purposes of this case.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.183
Fine by me.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.018
Because your op sec is blown,

17:40.018 --> 17:44.022
your agency can't know anything about
how they do whatever it is they do.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.735
That's why I came alone. Thank you.

17:49.361 --> 17:53.323
Sorry about your men.

17:59.663 --> 18:03.625
What'd you spot?

18:04.001 --> 18:08.005
Go-fast boats running that close?
On radar they look like one, not two.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.383
Total darkness?

18:11.383 --> 18:14.011
Man, those are skill sets.

18:14.011 --> 18:17.389
Plus, who runs four 250 Mercs
off a deep-V hull?

18:17.389 --> 18:18.724
Sal Maguda.

18:18.724 --> 18:22.686
-He that good?
-Oh, yeah.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.232
Bleaching it down.

18:27.232 --> 18:31.195
Must have just unloaded.

18:39.745 --> 18:43.749
-Who are we?
-How's your Creole?

19:10.317 --> 19:12.277
Do you know whose load this is?

19:12.277 --> 19:16.281
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

20:03.453 --> 20:05.414
Hello?

20:05.414 --> 20:08.458
Hey, Nicholas, my ace. What's up?

20:08.458 --> 20:10.127
Everything's good. You?

20:10.127 --> 20:11.879
<i>We good. We all good.</i>

20:11.879 --> 20:15.883
As a matter of fact, we're looking
to charge up your cash flow. Hold on.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.722
<i>-Nicholas, how you doing?
-Sonny. What's up?</i>

20:21.722 --> 20:24.516
Somebody's something's got to go
somewhere, some when.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.476
Not too distant in the future.

20:26.476 --> 20:30.480
Except he had transpo problems.

20:30.856 --> 20:32.774
Call Colombia.

20:32.774 --> 20:36.778
-Man, that's José Yero.
Really?

20:37.237 --> 20:41.241
He is AUC, you know.
Colombian right-wing paramilitaries.

20:41.575 --> 20:45.579
You know who they are?
They are vertically integrated. They are...

20:45.746 --> 20:49.249
You mean, they walk around
with constant erections?

20:49.249 --> 20:52.461
No. They farm, process, produce, export...

20:52.461 --> 20:54.213
I know what it means.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.632
No, see, it gives them attitude.

20:56.632 --> 20:59.551
A player negotiates too hard
and you never hear from him again,

20:59.551 --> 21:03.222
'cause these guys kill everything!

21:03.222 --> 21:04.556
I gotta know what's the skinny.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.934
-It's none of your fucking business.
-It can come back on me, baby.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.519
It can't come back on you, baby.

21:08.519 --> 21:11.396
-Am I assured of that?
-Hey, sunshine.

21:11.396 --> 21:14.858
When has Rico or Sonny
ever lied to you, huh?

21:14.858 --> 21:18.445
I mean, when has anything Rico told you
not happened exactly like he said?

21:18.445 --> 21:20.614
You saying I lie to you?
No, I'm not saying that...

21:20.614 --> 21:21.698
Yes, you are.

21:21.698 --> 21:23.450
It's just there's variables,
you know?

21:23.450 --> 21:25.244
Randomness, see? That's why.

21:25.244 --> 21:27.412
-"That's why," what?
-Well, why, like, if you can't deliver,

21:27.412 --> 21:30.624
this group goes from zero
to high-order violence like that.

21:30.624 --> 21:34.545
off three money-laundering prosecutions

21:34.545 --> 21:36.338
I put you into,

21:36.338 --> 21:39.174
you know, which is why you live
in your $4 million condo.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.843
And you question Rico and Sonny?

21:40.843 --> 21:44.847
Fuck that. I will cap your skanky ass
and throw it off that goddamn balcony.

21:45.222 --> 21:48.433
Yeah, then we can kick back and
watch Marlins highlights on this 65" plasma.

21:48.433 --> 21:51.228
After we clean this place up.
Don't you ever put anything away?

21:51.228 --> 21:54.648
Plus he's gonna commission José Yero
for putting you to José Yero.

21:54.648 --> 21:57.985
Anybody looking at his ill-gotten gains?
IRS looking into his shit?

21:57.985 --> 22:00.779
Any reason
this does not go down?

22:00.779 --> 22:04.700
That's the sound of air rapidly filling
the vacuum created by your departed body.

22:04.700 --> 22:08.704
On account of how fast I remanded your ass
back into custody.

22:08.954 --> 22:11.373
Why is this happening to me?

22:11.373 --> 22:13.458
Because you lead a life of crime.

22:13.458 --> 22:16.211
Can't do time, don't mess with crime.

22:16.211 --> 22:20.215
He's cool. He'll make the call.

23:10.349 --> 23:12.392
Hey, you.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.436
Wake up.

23:14.436 --> 23:17.481
What happened to you?
Aren't you excited to see me?

23:17.481 --> 23:18.857
I can't talk about it.

23:18.857 --> 23:22.861
-Mmm-hmm.
-This is all right.

23:56.019 --> 23:59.982
I'm just joking.

24:24.965 --> 24:28.969
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep right here. That's it.

24:44.359 --> 24:48.363
-Any word?
Nothing.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.539
"Hey, Trudy." Hey, Sonny.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.166
Hey, Trudy. How you doing, darling?

24:59.166 --> 25:00.792
Who are we here?

25:00.792 --> 25:04.796
It's the same fabricated fundamentals
as before.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.799
Rico.

25:07.799 --> 25:11.803
3-to-5 on assault, Folsom B-wing,
Pelican Bay.

25:11.803 --> 25:15.474
Sonny, Marine Corps,
Chicago, and 10 plus weapons.

25:15.474 --> 25:19.436
Five out of eight, and jumped parole.
Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.

25:20.062 --> 25:22.147
And then it goes cold,

25:22.147 --> 25:25.776
'cause presumably you're both too smart
and too fast to get jacked again.

25:25.776 --> 25:27.986
What about this place?

25:27.986 --> 25:31.073
It'll show up
leased under these aliases.

25:31.073 --> 25:32.491
How'd they test?

25:32.491 --> 25:35.661
-And who tested them?
-Helene in NYPD.

25:35.661 --> 25:37.829
And she worked through
your false identities,

25:37.829 --> 25:41.792
and then she found your deeper, hidden,
more criminal selves.

27:34.863 --> 27:37.282
-He's in.

27:37.282 --> 27:41.161
You're on. The meet's in Haiti.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.997
<i>He'll negotiate the price
in person.</i>

27:43.997 --> 27:46.041
<i>Call me after you've landed
in Port-au-Prince,</i>

27:46.041 --> 27:50.045
'cause only when you're on the ground
will he tell me where you are to go.

28:00.264 --> 28:04.226
Be careful. Be cool.

28:19.658 --> 28:23.120
Approaching. Turning to heading 340
down to 6,000 feet.

28:23.120 --> 28:27.082
Clear to the ILS runway 1-0
for the approach to Port-au-Prince.

29:02.659 --> 29:06.622
Why do I get the feeling everybody knows
we're here 15 blocks out?

29:06.830 --> 29:10.792
'Cause everybody knows
we're here 15 blocks out.

30:05.848 --> 30:08.100
Sit.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.142
José.

30:09.142 --> 30:12.938
Sonny Burnett.
That's my partner, Ricardo.

30:12.938 --> 30:14.940
Thank you for coming down.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.316
So, let's lay it out.

30:16.316 --> 30:18.443
Nicholas say you run a tight group.

30:18.443 --> 30:20.946
That's nice, 'cause we got product
that's got to move.

30:20.946 --> 30:23.448
-Real tight. We move as fast as FedEx.
-Move to where?

30:23.448 --> 30:25.701
To New York, through South Florida.

30:25.701 --> 30:28.245
Move when?
-Right now.

30:28.245 --> 30:30.080
That's kind of all of an instant.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.124
That means only one thing, real fast.

30:32.124 --> 30:35.502
So, the price, is it right?

30:35.502 --> 30:37.296
Price is right.

30:37.296 --> 30:41.300
But how I know if you any good at this shit?

30:45.220 --> 30:46.513
What's that?

30:46.513 --> 30:50.225
Yeah, your business.
How much volume you do?

30:50.225 --> 30:52.436
Whose product you move?
Who you work with?

30:52.436 --> 30:56.398
Other than Nicholas,
who the fuck knows you?

30:59.484 --> 31:03.447
Well, my mommy and daddy know me.

31:03.989 --> 31:05.490
And we don't talk about who we work with.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.451
And we didn't come down here
to audition for business.

31:07.451 --> 31:11.413
Business auditions for us.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.418
And knows all about us,
before they call Nicholas.

31:16.418 --> 31:20.422
That way we don't waste avgas
or our motherfucking time.

31:32.309 --> 31:34.853
You want us to be telling you
about our shit?

31:34.853 --> 31:37.022
You can't find out on your own?

31:37.022 --> 31:38.524
Why do I not buy that?

31:38.524 --> 31:40.526
You with DEA? The Feeb? What's up?

31:40.526 --> 31:43.779
They targeting our transpo line?
You with the Man?

31:43.779 --> 31:47.783
You wearing a wire?

31:53.372 --> 31:55.415
I'm gonna tell you
what's gonna happen.

31:55.415 --> 31:57.376
People gonna come in here,
and you know what they gonna say?

31:57.376 --> 31:58.585
They're gonna look around
and they're gonna go...

31:59.837 --> 32:02.422
"That's some crazy
motherfucking wallpaper. What is that?

32:02.422 --> 32:06.426
"Jackson Pollock?"

32:07.553 --> 32:11.557
<i>"No, viejo. That was José Yero,
who got splattered all over his own wall."</i>

32:12.891 --> 32:16.854
So, we can close each other's eyes
right now, real fast.

32:20.107 --> 32:24.111
But then ain't nobody
gonna make no money.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.533
José.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.094
So let's talk equipment.

32:49.094 --> 32:52.514
Adam A500s, carbon composite,
real stealthy.

32:52.514 --> 32:55.184
1,400 nautical-mile range, low and slow.

32:55.184 --> 32:58.228
We like Caravelles and 727 s
to move the product from source countries

32:58.228 --> 32:59.938
to transshipment places like here.

32:59.938 --> 33:02.107
Big loads, we like containers.

33:02.107 --> 33:05.611
Smaller loads into South Florida,
we do go-fast boats.

33:05.611 --> 33:07.070
So, what's the weight?

33:07.070 --> 33:09.031
-First, let's talk logistics.
-Okay.

33:09.031 --> 33:13.035
You pick up a load, you fly it in the hole,
we tell you the drop point,

33:13.076 --> 33:14.661
and our people then move it on up the road.

33:14.661 --> 33:18.665
Now, not so fast. People at the drop point
are our people, not yours.

33:19.124 --> 33:23.086
You know, so there's no tweakers, dopers,
first-timers, people we don't know.

33:24.338 --> 33:26.590
They didn't do time with us,
they ain't doing crime with us.

33:26.590 --> 33:29.134
Once we pick up the load,
the next time you hear from us

33:29.134 --> 33:30.969
it'll be a date, time, and a place.

33:30.969 --> 33:34.598
Like, "There's a 18-wheeler in a parking lot
in north Miami with the keys in the ignition."

33:34.598 --> 33:38.560
You pick it up, you drive away.
Smooth, that's how we do it.

33:40.896 --> 33:44.900
So, when you looking to move it?

33:45.526 --> 33:47.152
Never.

33:47.152 --> 33:50.697
'Cause how you drop loads, I don't like,
so maybe this don't work.

33:50.697 --> 33:53.116
Then it don't work.

33:53.116 --> 33:56.411
Red light, green light, José.

33:56.411 --> 34:00.082
<i>They also call me Cochi Loco.</i>

34:00.082 --> 34:02.584
That means "crazy pig."

34:02.584 --> 34:05.712
'Cause I run security and counterintel.

34:05.712 --> 34:09.716
I get people to tell me
what they don't ever want to say.

34:10.425 --> 34:13.512
And I have eyes everywhere.

34:13.512 --> 34:17.516
That part of what I do,
you never want to find out about.

34:19.434 --> 34:23.397
Other people negotiate money,
and go and no go.

34:23.397 --> 34:27.400
Yes, no, maybe so.

34:28.569 --> 34:30.445
Not me.

34:30.445 --> 34:32.614
So, what the hell are we talking to you for?

34:32.614 --> 34:36.159
-I had to lay my eyes on you.
Why is that?

34:36.159 --> 34:40.121
To see if you go meet the Man.

34:42.958 --> 34:46.962
And?

34:47.379 --> 34:51.382
You seem okay.

34:51.550 --> 34:53.552
But him,

34:53.552 --> 34:57.556
I don't like how he looks.

34:58.724 --> 35:02.686
Do you want to fuck my partner,
or do you want to do business with us?

35:03.437 --> 35:07.441
'Cause I don't give a shit
how you think he looks.

35:08.066 --> 35:11.778
Wait by the phone in the hotel.

35:11.778 --> 35:15.782
You get a call, or maybe you don't.

35:16.074 --> 35:20.078
And then you can piss off
back to where you come from.

36:14.174 --> 36:18.136
Yero said New York
through South Florida.

36:18.136 --> 36:21.306
Then this load
does not go to the Miami group.

36:21.306 --> 36:25.310
That may take load number two.

36:39.658 --> 36:43.662
That was fast.

37:06.560 --> 37:10.564
Four hours. They're dicking us around.
Call it.

37:12.274 --> 37:13.650
That's it.

37:13.650 --> 37:17.613
Let's go.

37:56.568 --> 38:00.572
Put your guns on the table.

38:02.574 --> 38:06.161
We didn't bring you here to kill you.

38:06.161 --> 38:10.165
If we want you dead, you'd have been
no longer drawing breath in Miami.

38:16.255 --> 38:19.466
$3,000 a kilo on small loads.

38:19.466 --> 38:20.926
Thought we had
to meet the Man.

38:20.926 --> 38:22.427
You do.

38:22.427 --> 38:26.390
-When is that?
-Right now.

38:44.658 --> 38:48.662
Full signal, no service.
They're jamming the phones.

38:50.789 --> 38:54.751
This is the type of stuff the CIA does.
In Baghdad.

38:54.793 --> 38:58.797
Yeah. What's it doing on a dope deal?

39:24.281 --> 39:28.243
Out of the car.

39:49.014 --> 39:53.018
See the three trucks?
Move there now.

40:08.784 --> 40:12.788
Where'd all the people go?

40:30.973 --> 40:34.977
Ready, boss?

40:42.067 --> 40:44.486
Excuse me, because I am very busy.

40:44.486 --> 40:48.490
I have many things to do,
so this will be brief. Yes?

40:48.490 --> 40:52.494
I will try you out on one load to build trust.

40:54.454 --> 40:58.458
1,000 ki's out of Colombia.
Your end is $3 million.

40:59.501 --> 41:02.713
In all matters, when you work for me,

41:02.713 --> 41:06.675
you must do
exactly what you say you will do.

41:07.050 --> 41:11.013
In this business with me,
I do not buy a service. I buy a result.

41:11.805 --> 41:14.099
If you say you will do a thing,

41:14.099 --> 41:18.103
you must do exactly that thing.

41:18.729 --> 41:22.691
Then you will prosper beyond your dreams
and live in Miami millionaire-style.

41:25.152 --> 41:27.613
You will contact and work
through José Yero

41:27.613 --> 41:30.866
on logistics, communications, security.

41:30.866 --> 41:34.870
To do with money and terms,
you will work through my Isabella.

41:35.704 --> 41:39.708
I look forward
to our doing more work together.

41:40.459 --> 41:44.421
Whether we do or do not,
it is unlikely that we will meet again.

41:46.381 --> 41:50.385
I extend my best wishes to your families.

41:54.890 --> 41:58.894
Thank you for making this trip to see me.

43:31.028 --> 43:35.032
<i>Flight 000 is airborne.</i>

43:35.032 --> 43:38.994
<i>Roger that.</i>

44:01.099 --> 44:05.062
Good afternoon.
Radar contact. Climb and maintain 7,000.

44:06.104 --> 44:10.025
November 636
is coming your way from the northwest.

44:10.025 --> 44:14.029
636.

44:24.873 --> 44:27.125
Opa-Iocka Departure,
good afternoon.

44:27.125 --> 44:30.796
Radar contact. Climb and maintain 7,000.

44:30.796 --> 44:33.799
King Air 1206 Sierra,

44:33.799 --> 44:37.761
<i>you see anything off your right side?</i>

44:41.640 --> 44:45.644
<i>This is November 1206 Sierra.
Negative, Opa-Iocka.</i>

44:47.646 --> 44:51.608
I got a double hit.
I think there's another plane there.

45:03.078 --> 45:06.623
Let me see.

45:06.623 --> 45:09.334
Go down to 220.

45:09.334 --> 45:13.338
Ghost. One blip, one plane.

45:37.779 --> 45:38.864
Yeah.

45:38.864 --> 45:42.868
<i>Oye, Burnett. Our client got delivery.
Product's on the road. Good work.</i>

45:43.160 --> 45:46.371
Yeah, but we had a problem
before your client showed up.

45:46.371 --> 45:50.334
<i>Somebody tried
to rip off the load.</i>

45:54.046 --> 45:57.090
<i>You know a detail shop
on Second and Overtown?</i>

45:57.090 --> 45:58.217
I do.

45:58.217 --> 46:02.179
<i>Across the street we found a stash house.</i>

46:08.727 --> 46:12.689
Here we go.

46:15.817 --> 46:19.821
Only two.

46:34.920 --> 46:38.924
They tried to jack your load.
We brought him home and discovered this.

46:40.425 --> 46:43.929
Haitians stole this two weeks ago.

46:43.929 --> 46:46.139
That's my load. This is my product.

46:46.139 --> 46:50.143
How'd they know where the drop was?

46:51.270 --> 46:55.274
-How'd they know?
-I find out.

46:57.943 --> 47:01.905
See you later.

47:08.370 --> 47:12.374
I see you,
I see a load we lost two weeks ago

47:13.792 --> 47:15.377
all in the same place.

47:15.377 --> 47:19.381
Well, you don't like us finding your load,
we can go ahead and lose it all over again.

47:19.882 --> 47:23.886
What other suspicions
did you mastermind today?

47:37.357 --> 47:40.068
We want our product back.

47:40.068 --> 47:41.278
Sure.

47:41.278 --> 47:43.071
How much?

47:43.071 --> 47:47.075
How much...

47:47.075 --> 47:51.079
-For what?
-For recovering that.

47:52.122 --> 47:54.499
Nothing.

47:54.499 --> 47:56.460
Nothing?

47:56.460 --> 48:00.422
Consider it an investment

48:01.006 --> 48:04.968
in the future of a fine business relationship.

48:05.344 --> 48:09.348
That is because it's yours.
What's yours is yours.

48:16.146 --> 48:19.399
So is this a one-time deal?

48:19.399 --> 48:23.403
Or is something else coming up?

48:31.912 --> 48:35.916
Give them the shipment on the 17th.

48:40.003 --> 48:43.966
Conveyance?
-By ocean. Out of Barranquilla.

48:47.427 --> 48:51.431
José has details.

49:04.570 --> 49:06.071
Lay it out.

49:06.071 --> 49:09.992
You're gonna get the longs and lats
for a transshipment point.

49:09.992 --> 49:12.870
Ma'am.

49:12.870 --> 49:14.913
-Do me one favor.
-Yeah?

49:14.913 --> 49:17.499
In return for the risks we took
in recovering your load,

49:17.499 --> 49:21.503
allow me to buy you a drink.

49:27.426 --> 49:30.262
How fast does that go?

49:30.262 --> 49:34.224
Goes very fast.

49:34.474 --> 49:36.602
Show me.

49:36.602 --> 49:40.105
Where would you like to go?

49:40.105 --> 49:43.984
What do you like to drink?

49:43.984 --> 49:47.988
I'm a fiend for mojitos.

49:48.113 --> 49:52.075
I know a place.

49:52.492 --> 49:56.496
Partner.

49:57.873 --> 50:01.877
I know what I'm doing.

50:08.050 --> 50:10.135
All right. The secured satellite comms,

50:10.135 --> 50:12.638
longs and lats for the transshipment points,
that's all cool.

50:12.638 --> 50:14.598
But I need a vector, not a location.

50:14.598 --> 50:16.475
Ships move, that's why they call them ships.

50:16.475 --> 50:19.228
Ship stops, it's trying to impersonate
an apartment building.

50:19.228 --> 50:22.898
At sea, that is very suspicious.
Brings about attention.

50:22.898 --> 50:26.902
AWACS, Coast Guard, U.S. Customs,
that's all bad.

50:43.168 --> 50:46.630
I take you to the best place for mojitos.

50:46.630 --> 50:49.007
Where is that?

50:49.007 --> 50:51.051
Bodeguita del Medio.

50:51.051 --> 50:55.013
Oh, the Keys?

50:55.013 --> 50:57.432
Havana.

50:57.432 --> 51:00.519
Havana?

51:00.519 --> 51:03.647
Cubans don't like my business.

51:03.647 --> 51:07.609
-And they don't like my passport.
-It's okay, the harbormaster is my cousin.

51:25.669 --> 51:29.631
Grab the wheel.

51:39.683 --> 51:43.645
You do business in Cuba
with your husband?

51:44.021 --> 51:46.732
I never do business in Cuba.

51:46.732 --> 51:50.736
And Jesús is not my husband.

51:55.115 --> 51:59.119
I'm a businesswoman.

51:59.328 --> 52:03.332
I do not need a husband
to have a house to live in.

53:17.155 --> 53:21.118
-You like the mojito?
-Mojito's great.

53:23.871 --> 53:27.749
Do you dance?

53:27.749 --> 53:31.753
I dance.

56:30.516 --> 56:32.351
You will like it.

56:32.351 --> 56:34.853
Allman Brothers.
You know Allman Brothers?

56:34.853 --> 56:36.063
No.

56:36.063 --> 56:38.607
<i>Lynyrd Skynyrd? Free Bird?</i>

56:38.607 --> 56:42.027
-No Skynyrd.
-Well, that was the music back then.

56:42.027 --> 56:44.696
And he played all those Atlanta bars.

56:44.696 --> 56:48.659
But his luck was...

56:49.368 --> 56:53.330
Well, my dad never got lucky,
so he started trucking.

56:54.373 --> 56:58.335
Yeah, I didn't see a whole lot of him.
But we were close.

57:02.381 --> 57:06.385
-You look like your mother?
-Why?

57:08.345 --> 57:11.890
She died in Angola when I was 16.

57:11.890 --> 57:15.477
She was a translator.

57:15.477 --> 57:19.481
I show you photograph. It's from wedding.

57:31.785 --> 57:35.789
This is a bad idea.

57:36.373 --> 57:38.584
This is past a bad idea.

57:38.584 --> 57:41.044
And it has no future.

57:41.044 --> 57:44.464
That's right.

57:44.464 --> 57:48.051
So, then there's nothing to worry about.

57:48.051 --> 57:52.014
Come here.

58:46.693 --> 58:50.697
See?

58:52.658 --> 58:56.161
Lucinda somebody's wedding.

58:56.161 --> 58:59.456
Everybody is with couples.

58:59.456 --> 59:03.418
Husbands and wives, they all pose.

59:04.002 --> 59:08.006
But she is the most special.

01:00:12.988 --> 01:00:16.992
Let's talk a different kind of deal.

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:27.669
You pay us zero.

01:00:28.879 --> 01:00:30.797
Is it December?

01:00:30.797 --> 01:00:32.299
Why?

01:00:32.299 --> 01:00:35.052
Did Christmas come early this year?

01:00:35.052 --> 01:00:37.262
No.

01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:40.974
We become partners on the loads we run.

01:00:46.688 --> 01:00:49.233
And why, you're thinking,

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:52.819
<i>would I be crazy enough
to cut in these gringos like that?</i>

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:56.823
It's because Sonny and Ricardo
can deliver to me what no one else can.

01:00:58.116 --> 01:01:00.953
We guarantee loads.

01:01:00.953 --> 01:01:04.915
Comes up short, we make good.

01:01:05.123 --> 01:01:09.127
Your operation will run
from now on out risk-free.

01:01:16.677 --> 01:01:19.137
You?

01:01:19.137 --> 01:01:23.100
What if I tell you
your ideas are too big for your skin?

01:01:24.268 --> 01:01:28.230
And merely to propose this
is a dangerous thing.

01:01:30.691 --> 01:01:33.777
Then I would say to you, this has been fun.

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:37.739
Okay. So?

01:01:41.702 --> 01:01:44.162
Think of the cash you don't have to front.

01:01:44.162 --> 01:01:48.125
Cash is not difficult.

01:01:54.006 --> 01:01:57.968
Seventeen.

01:01:59.636 --> 01:02:03.390
I would say you're five percentage points
away from a deal.

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:07.394
Maybe I'm only one.

01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:13.066
You've convinced me.

01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:26.997
-I'm on my way back.

01:02:48.393 --> 01:02:51.313
The meeting with Castillo
is in 45 minutes.

01:02:51.313 --> 01:02:53.982
-What's up, Sonny. You okay?
-Fine, darling.

01:02:53.982 --> 01:02:55.150
So, where you been?

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:57.236
Hit a couple of jazz clubs,
fell back to her place.

01:02:57.236 --> 01:02:58.695
-Where?
-Vedado.

01:02:58.695 --> 01:03:00.906
-Where's Vedado?
-Suburbs outside Havana.

01:03:00.906 --> 01:03:03.825
-You went to Havana, Cuba?
-No, Havana, Louisiana.

01:03:03.825 --> 01:03:05.035
Don't we have a meet?

01:03:05.035 --> 01:03:06.453
You making moves on Montoya's woman?

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:08.288
-No.
-You're not making moves on her?

01:03:08.288 --> 01:03:12.292
-We're making moves on each other.
-Oh, so that's supposed to make it all right?

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:16.672
Something like that.

01:03:17.714 --> 01:03:21.718
-So what happened to the first load?
-Went to Dominicans in New York.

01:03:21.927 --> 01:03:25.931
We think load number two's going
to our guys. South Florida. Their big buyer.

01:03:27.099 --> 01:03:30.435
-Okay, that's great.
-Yeah.

01:03:30.435 --> 01:03:34.064
But we wanna go beyond load number two.

01:03:34.064 --> 01:03:38.026
-Why are we going exploring?
-Who's the "we"?

01:03:38.026 --> 01:03:40.904
Only thing you've contributed so far to this
is bad intel.

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:44.908
-How's that?
-José Yero, cocaine producer?

01:03:45.117 --> 01:03:48.912
Yero's middle management,
part of a bigger transnational operation

01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:51.373
run by Arcángel de Jesús Montoya.

01:03:51.373 --> 01:03:54.459
Montoya's the new news. Globalized.

01:03:54.459 --> 01:03:55.752
Moving?

01:03:55.752 --> 01:03:58.213
Colombian coke and H,
arms from the Ukraine,

01:03:58.213 --> 01:04:01.091
E from Holland,
pirated software from China into Brazil.

01:04:01.091 --> 01:04:04.469
What's this got to do
with the price of tea in China?

01:04:04.469 --> 01:04:06.972
We're seeing their ops.

01:04:07.181 --> 01:04:10.517
Transpo.
You know, money-laundering networks.

01:04:10.517 --> 01:04:13.729
It would take years
to put together a deal like this.

01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:17.733
We want to stay under,
run in load number two and keep going,

01:04:19.276 --> 01:04:23.280
and hold off busting the ABs or Yero.

01:04:23.322 --> 01:04:26.742
We illuminate Montoya's operations
from the inside.

01:04:26.742 --> 01:04:29.536
No one has ever tread before
where we are now.

01:04:29.536 --> 01:04:32.539
Well, the answer's no.

01:04:32.539 --> 01:04:36.376
We take the Aryan Brothers, the shooters,
pressure them for the leak.

01:04:36.376 --> 01:04:37.503
It's a bird in the hand.

01:04:37.503 --> 01:04:41.465
I'm not changing my op plan
for speculation masquerading as intel.

01:04:42.174 --> 01:04:44.551
Look, I know undercover
requires aggression,

01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:47.888
some outlaw attitude. You know,
how else do you lie down with dogs?

01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:49.389
-Okay, but that...
-Go fuck yourself.

01:04:49.389 --> 01:04:53.352
Chill. Sonny, chill.

01:04:54.228 --> 01:04:56.355
You know what this prick's game is?

01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:59.358
<i>He'll get his picture in the Miami Herald
off a quick bust,</i>

01:04:59.358 --> 01:05:02.236
save his punk-ass career
at the slug farm in DC.

01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:06.198
-We are not backing off this.
That's it.

01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:11.203
Where you on this?

01:05:15.874 --> 01:05:19.837
Change the mission statement.

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.216
I have to run it past my ADO in DC.

01:05:24.216 --> 01:05:27.928
Hey, slick. Don't try and shine me on.

01:05:27.928 --> 01:05:31.390
You don't have the time or the skill.

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:34.935
If I close this down,

01:05:34.935 --> 01:05:38.397
I will close it down right now.

01:05:38.397 --> 01:05:42.359
And you can sink in Washington.

01:05:44.403 --> 01:05:48.365
All right, do it.

01:05:48.782 --> 01:05:52.744
You fucking better be right.

01:05:59.793 --> 01:06:02.421
-So, what's going on?
-As in?

01:06:02.421 --> 01:06:06.383
As in, there's undercover
and then there is, "Which way is up?"

01:06:07.509 --> 01:06:11.513
Oh, you think I'm in so deep, I forgot?

01:06:14.725 --> 01:06:18.729
I will never doubt you.

01:07:15.953 --> 01:07:18.622
Did you find it?
Yeah.

01:07:18.622 --> 01:07:21.834
Dominion or Blackstone hedge funds?

01:07:21.834 --> 01:07:24.920
Through Hong Kong bank?
Yes.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.339
Ukrainian shipment?

01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:31.301
Eight tons, small arms and RPGs

01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:34.763
on the 27th.

01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:38.559
Tell me about the deal in South Florida.

01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:42.563
to bring in loads. They guarantee them.

01:07:42.938 --> 01:07:46.525
Our risk goes to zero.

01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:49.528
And Burnett?

01:07:49.528 --> 01:07:53.490
What does your intuition tell you?

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:58.954
My intuition about Burnett?

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:06.420
I slept with him in Havana.

01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:14.511
And?

01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:16.721
A serious man.

01:08:16.721 --> 01:08:20.684
Ambitious, but he has to be watched.

01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:24.897
After a few good runs,
he will renegotiate the deal upwards.

01:08:25.772 --> 01:08:29.484
That's my girl.

01:08:29.484 --> 01:08:33.197
But José Yero thinks you are wrong.

01:08:33.197 --> 01:08:37.201
On the next load, he wants
to front them silver, but pay them in lead.

01:08:44.041 --> 01:08:48.045
What do you wanna do?

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.508
I like the diminished risk.

01:08:52.508 --> 01:08:56.511
I like businessmen who are competent
because you can predict their behavior.

01:09:01.558 --> 01:09:05.562
<i>On the other hand, if what you wish
is el plomo, the lead, then do that.</i>

01:09:07.147 --> 01:09:11.109
After the load is received,
we will close their eyes forever.

01:09:20.827 --> 01:09:24.831
We will try a few runs with these partners.

01:09:24.831 --> 01:09:28.836
I will tell José.

01:11:18.612 --> 01:11:21.949
<i>Hola, chica.</i>

01:11:21.949 --> 01:11:25.911
<i>Hola, chico.</i>

01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:34.628
Hey, what's up? This is Trudy, my girl.

01:11:34.628 --> 01:11:37.130
-It's a pleasure.
-Hey, nice club.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:38.298
I redid it.

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:42.302
And I got places in Medellín,
Foz do Iguaçu, and Rio.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:47.724
-You like clubs?
-Oh, yeah. I'm a disco guy.

01:11:52.104 --> 01:11:56.066
In the back.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:12.583
In Colón, in Panama, a Malaysian freighter
will transfer eight tons.

01:12:14.126 --> 01:12:17.171
Crates with Russian marking.

01:12:17.171 --> 01:12:19.339
Do not open them.

01:12:19.339 --> 01:12:23.302
The 4,000 ki's you move into Miami,
you keep and release when we say.

01:12:25.012 --> 01:12:29.016
So long as delivery goes down our way.

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:31.351
Sure.

01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:35.230
But the crates,
they come back to Barranquilla.

01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:37.858
You want us to break down the load
for different buyers?

01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:41.862
No. It's one, my main South Florida guy.

01:12:42.988 --> 01:12:45.699
José, my ace.

01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:47.910
Skies are crowded, man.

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:51.914
AWAC's, ICE, DEA spies in the sky.

01:12:51.914 --> 01:12:55.918
Do you have any counterintel you could
contribute to the good and the welfare?

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.670
Sure.

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:02.633
Check your e-mail.

01:13:43.131 --> 01:13:44.174
Hello?

01:13:47.219 --> 01:13:49.471
It's José.

01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:52.891
<i>-José, what is it?
-I don't like the Americans.</i>

01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:56.186
-Why?
-Too good at what they do.

01:13:56.186 --> 01:13:58.438
<i>So?</i>

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:00.107
They are wrong.

01:14:00.107 --> 01:14:04.027
Somehow, somehow they are wrong.

01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:07.030
You ran them. Did you run them?

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:11.034
<i>-Yes.
-Do they check out?</i>

01:14:11.034 --> 01:14:12.536
Yes.

01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:14.746
<i>We made their deal.</i>

01:14:14.746 --> 01:14:18.709
And Isabella disagrees with you.

01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:44.878
Once I had a fortune.

01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:48.882
It said, "Live now.
Life is short. Time is luck."

01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:56.890
You got assets somewhere?

01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:58.934
Insurance?

01:15:58.934 --> 01:16:02.938
Why?

01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:06.567
Things go wrong.

01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:10.571
The odds catch up.

01:16:13.448 --> 01:16:17.452
Probability is like gravity.

01:16:19.538 --> 01:16:23.500
You cannot negotiate with gravity.

01:16:25.085 --> 01:16:29.089
One day...

01:16:29.173 --> 01:16:33.177
One day you should just cash out,
you know.

01:16:33.177 --> 01:16:35.345
Just cash out and get out.

01:16:35.345 --> 01:16:39.057
-Yeah?
-Yeah. As far and as fast as you can.

01:16:39.057 --> 01:16:40.601
Would you find me?

01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:43.937
Yes, I would.

01:16:43.937 --> 01:16:47.941
This is very Cuban.
The protective male talking.

01:16:47.941 --> 01:16:51.069
It's the talk of a man.

01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:53.614
If he were your husband,

01:16:53.614 --> 01:16:57.326
he would never put you at risk.

01:16:57.326 --> 01:17:00.954
And he would never put you within
1,000 miles of anything

01:17:00.954 --> 01:17:03.916
that could hurt you.

01:17:03.916 --> 01:17:07.878
And where would you be?

01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:12.257
A while longer still in this business,
and then I'd find you.

01:17:12.966 --> 01:17:16.053
-Would you?
-Yes, ma'am.

01:17:16.053 --> 01:17:20.057
If you couldn't,
I would have left the only thing I know

01:17:20.307 --> 01:17:24.311
since I was 17.

01:17:37.324 --> 01:17:40.744
But none of this will happen.

01:17:40.744 --> 01:17:44.039
Because what do you see around?

01:17:44.039 --> 01:17:47.042
Look around you.

01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:51.046
It's controlled
by Arcángel de Jesús Montoya.

01:18:14.319 --> 01:18:16.697
Let me talk to Fujima.

01:18:16.697 --> 01:18:19.408
-Ricardo.

01:18:19.408 --> 01:18:21.994
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:24.538
Listen, I want you to issue an alert.

01:18:24.538 --> 01:18:26.748
<i>An informant has revealed
that a freighter</i>

01:18:26.748 --> 01:18:28.458
departed Barranquilla

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:32.254
for South Florida with plans
to transship contraband to go-fast boats

01:18:32.254 --> 01:18:35.340
<i>in broad daylight</i>

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.176
Okay.

01:18:37.176 --> 01:18:39.219
For Customs, you say Monday.

01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:42.389
For FBI operations in DC, you say Tuesday.

01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:46.185
FBI Miami, you say Wednesday,
DEA on Thursday,

01:18:46.185 --> 01:18:50.147
Coast Guard on Friday.
And keep it classified, keep it discreet,

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.484
keep it out of interagency communications.

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:49.808
Yero hit me back.

01:20:49.808 --> 01:20:53.770
He says U.S. assets expects
our transshipment load on Tuesday day.

01:20:54.354 --> 01:20:58.358
Tuesday day only went out
to FBI Operations planted in DC.

01:21:00.736 --> 01:21:02.404
So what's up?

01:21:02.404 --> 01:21:06.408
Anything could be in
those crates out of Odessa.

01:21:08.744 --> 01:21:12.748
This one has too many moving parts,
too many unknowns.

01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:17.252
It's your call.

01:21:17.252 --> 01:21:18.587
Where you at?

01:21:18.587 --> 01:21:21.381
The message from Yero
locates the agency and the office

01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:24.259
where the leak is coming from.
I call that progress.

01:21:24.259 --> 01:21:28.263
So, let's take it to the limit one more time.

01:22:22.484 --> 01:22:26.488
Move!

01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:34.538
<i>We got to go. Rápido.</i>

01:22:47.759 --> 01:22:49.720
Let's go. Let's go. Come on, let's go.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.972
-How we looking?
-I can take one more.

01:22:51.972 --> 01:22:55.934
Good. Let's move!

01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:03.734
That's it. Take off.

01:23:07.779 --> 01:23:11.742
Let's hit it.

01:23:21.376 --> 01:23:23.962
All right, Julio, break the lines
and straighten the load.

01:23:23.962 --> 01:23:25.005
Break the lines.

01:23:25.005 --> 01:23:28.967
We'll rendezvous in about eight hours.

01:23:40.479 --> 01:23:43.482
<i>where most people feel at home,</i>

01:23:43.482 --> 01:23:45.526
<i>it's right in their own backyard.</i>

01:23:45.526 --> 01:23:49.488
<i>And that's why today, more than ever,
homeowners are asking,</i>

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:52.908
<i>"What can we do to make
our backyard a paradise,</i>

01:23:52.908 --> 01:23:55.953
<i>"a vacation destination
you can visit anytime,</i>

01:23:55.953 --> 01:23:59.957
<i>"without the hassle of air travel,
or even starting the car?"</i>

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:04.002
<i>We'll answer these questions
and much more.</i>

01:24:55.929 --> 01:24:59.933
Be loaded up in a minute.

01:25:18.619 --> 01:25:21.121
-Yeah?

01:25:21.121 --> 01:25:23.916
Who are you? Who is this?

01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:27.920
<i>Shut up and listen.</i>

01:25:36.929 --> 01:25:38.931
<i>in weather today,</i>

01:25:38.931 --> 01:25:40.599
<i>there's new activity in the tropics.</i>

01:25:40.599 --> 01:25:43.685
<i>We turn things over to meteorologist
Ryan Phillips. What's developing?</i>

01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:46.146
<i>three years ago today, July 24th,</i>

01:25:46.146 --> 01:25:48.941
<i>that's when Hurricane Danny
formed out across the Atlantic Basin.</i>

01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:51.944
<i>And now we have our own tropical troubles
as Hurricane Ernesto, a category...</i>

01:25:51.944 --> 01:25:55.489
Somebody's proving it's right now.

01:25:55.489 --> 01:25:56.573
Yeah.

01:25:57.783 --> 01:25:59.910
<i>And we've got
some good news about your electric bill.</i>

01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:01.537
<i>Your rates will not be going up.</i>

01:26:01.537 --> 01:26:04.498
Say hello, honey.

01:26:04.498 --> 01:26:07.209
Some nice friends you got.

01:26:07.209 --> 01:26:11.213
Urban trailer trash
with B.O. and a noisy fucking...

01:26:23.684 --> 01:26:26.228
Yeah.

01:26:26.228 --> 01:26:30.232
They know.

01:26:33.777 --> 01:26:35.195
Pay attention.

01:26:35.195 --> 01:26:39.157
I will now tell you when
and how this load will get dropped.

01:26:39.199 --> 01:26:41.535
This is happening our way.

01:26:41.535 --> 01:26:44.663
<i>You have 30 minutes from right now
to enter Government Cut.</i>

01:26:44.663 --> 01:26:47.708
<i>Head up the Miami River.
You have 15 minutes</i>

01:26:47.708 --> 01:26:49.960
<i>to make it to the First Avenue bridge.</i>

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.922
When you're there,
I'll call you with the exact drop point.

01:26:53.922 --> 01:26:57.926
You fuck up, we fuck her up.

01:27:14.318 --> 01:27:15.777
What's the deal?

01:27:23.076 --> 01:27:27.080
J.C.!

01:28:08.372 --> 01:28:10.374
Zito!

01:28:10.374 --> 01:28:14.378
Zito, you copy?

01:28:14.378 --> 01:28:18.382
<i>Don't hear you. Go again.</i>

01:28:20.801 --> 01:28:24.012
Zito, do you copy?

01:28:24.012 --> 01:28:28.016
<i>Go to marine 78.</i>

01:28:38.986 --> 01:28:41.154
What's the ask? What do they want?

01:28:41.154 --> 01:28:44.366
<i>They want us to drop the load their way.</i>

01:28:44.366 --> 01:28:45.993
<i>They got eyes on us.</i>

01:28:45.993 --> 01:28:49.997
<i>We're on a timetable. The next call that
we get will be at the First Avenue bridge.</i>

01:28:50.205 --> 01:28:51.665
<i>Where do we hook up?</i>

01:28:51.665 --> 01:28:53.959
Hook up at the Port bridge ahead of that.

01:29:03.093 --> 01:29:06.346
Urban trailer park. Did you hear the roar?

01:29:06.346 --> 01:29:08.807
<i>-Was it near the freeway?
-No, no, no. Airport.</i>

01:29:08.807 --> 01:29:10.851
<i>Sonny, Rico,</i>

01:29:10.851 --> 01:29:12.436
where is the drop site?

01:29:12.436 --> 01:29:15.022
<i>They got Trudy.</i>

01:29:15.022 --> 01:29:17.232
Maybe in a trailer park near an airport.

01:29:17.232 --> 01:29:21.236
Look for antennas.
These guys manage a lot of signal traffic.

01:29:21.361 --> 01:29:24.364
They will not kill her
until they've got the goods.

01:29:24.364 --> 01:29:27.367
Once they've got the goods, she is dead.

01:29:27.367 --> 01:29:31.371
When they see the boat, we slow this down.
Buy some time.

01:29:31.371 --> 01:29:34.041
Did they prove she's alive?

01:29:34.041 --> 01:29:38.045
That's the first thing they put through.

01:29:48.764 --> 01:29:52.768
<i>Try Paradise Trailer Park near the airport.</i>

01:30:13.163 --> 01:30:17.167
<i>Sonny, I got a possible.
It has three HF antennas.</i>

01:30:17.459 --> 01:30:21.463
<i>It's on the corner lot at the southeast end.</i>

01:31:10.387 --> 01:31:12.389
For you.

01:31:12.389 --> 01:31:14.183
Hello?

01:31:14.183 --> 01:31:16.768
Where are you?

01:31:16.768 --> 01:31:19.938
Geneva.

01:31:19.938 --> 01:31:23.817
Yero's buyer jacked one of our people.

01:31:23.817 --> 01:31:26.486
<i>-What the fuck's going on?
-What's he want?</i>

01:31:26.486 --> 01:31:28.989
<i>To control the delivery.</i>

01:31:28.989 --> 01:31:32.534
It's Yero, not the buyer.

01:31:32.534 --> 01:31:34.828
<i>He wants to kill you.</i>

01:31:34.828 --> 01:31:38.081
<i>I do not know what shit he's pulling, okay?</i>

01:31:38.081 --> 01:31:42.085
But whatever he tells you to do,
do not do it.

01:31:49.468 --> 01:31:53.430
-So?
-It's José Yero. Be a hit and a rip.

01:32:00.896 --> 01:32:04.900
<i>Two and a half minutes
before we hit the drop site.</i>

01:32:05.901 --> 01:32:09.905
Copy that.

01:32:52.155 --> 01:32:56.159
Hold it.

01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:35.574
Clear.

01:34:04.645 --> 01:34:06.188
Copy.

01:34:06.188 --> 01:34:10.192
<i>I'm approaching on a west parallel street.</i>

01:34:11.318 --> 01:34:15.322
It's clear. Sonny's in position on the east.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.204
Four people. Two shooters.

01:34:45.644 --> 01:34:49.648
Milano's Pizza.

01:34:55.529 --> 01:34:57.614
You order pizza?

01:34:57.614 --> 01:35:01.618
No.

01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:08.375
Hold it!

01:35:08.375 --> 01:35:09.793
Hold it!

01:35:09.793 --> 01:35:13.797
Drop the detonator!

01:35:16.675 --> 01:35:20.637
Drop the detonator!

01:35:26.226 --> 01:35:30.230
Leon, no.

01:35:49.082 --> 01:35:53.086
Shoot me, she dies.

01:35:53.587 --> 01:35:56.757
Shoot me. Go ahead.

01:35:56.757 --> 01:35:59.259
Fuck it. We can all go.

01:35:59.259 --> 01:36:00.719
-That's cool.
-That's not what happens.

01:36:00.719 --> 01:36:03.263
What will happen is...

01:36:03.263 --> 01:36:06.850
What will happen is, I will put a round
at 2,700 feet per second

01:36:06.850 --> 01:36:09.436
into the medulla at the base of your brain,

01:36:09.436 --> 01:36:13.106
and you will be dead from the neck down
before your body knows it.

01:36:13.106 --> 01:36:16.652
Your finger won't even twitch.
Only you get dead.

01:36:16.652 --> 01:36:19.530
So, tell me, sport, do you believe that?

01:36:19.530 --> 01:36:23.534
Hey...

01:36:25.661 --> 01:36:29.665
Get down!

01:36:32.751 --> 01:36:36.713
-Be still.
-We got her.

01:37:05.117 --> 01:37:09.121
-Motherfucker!
-He's dead.

01:37:09.454 --> 01:37:13.417
All right?

01:37:29.808 --> 01:37:33.770
Those guys and your product
are a no-show.

01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:49.828
Stay here until we clear. Do you hear me?

01:37:49.828 --> 01:37:52.164
Our QTH is C-33.

01:37:52.164 --> 01:37:56.126
We are in the northeast corner
of the trailer park.

01:37:56.251 --> 01:38:00.255
Clear!

01:38:20.192 --> 01:38:24.154
Maria.

01:39:00.732 --> 01:39:02.442
Get out of the car.
-I already called the medic.

01:39:02.442 --> 01:39:04.403
Get out!

01:39:04.403 --> 01:39:08.365
Open the door.

01:39:09.241 --> 01:39:10.784
Open the door.

01:39:13.704 --> 01:39:17.708
Come on.

01:39:49.907 --> 01:39:53.744
You know what gets me?

01:39:53.744 --> 01:39:57.581
The prospect of her losing her life.

01:39:57.581 --> 01:40:01.585
Of her losing her life
over this bullshit line of work.

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.923
-Is that what she thinks?
-No, it's what I think.

01:40:05.964 --> 01:40:09.843
She'd tell me,
"Rico, I ain't playing. This is real.

01:40:09.843 --> 01:40:12.638
"Same as you. No less than you."

01:40:12.638 --> 01:40:16.642
Yeah.

01:40:17.893 --> 01:40:21.897
Hey.

01:40:22.648 --> 01:40:26.610
She's in recovery.

01:40:27.319 --> 01:40:31.323
We're gonna keep her totally sedated
with a complete muscle relaxant.

01:40:31.823 --> 01:40:34.034
She's in a coma.

01:40:34.034 --> 01:40:38.038
And her right lung is collapsed,
burst spleen.

01:40:40.415 --> 01:40:42.042
So what's her chances?

01:40:42.042 --> 01:40:44.586
The brain swelling worries us the most.

01:40:44.586 --> 01:40:48.590
You relieve the pressure?
-Not surgically. It's too diffuse.

01:40:48.715 --> 01:40:52.719
And any complication,
an infection, and she's...

01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:59.434
She's in bad shape.

01:41:03.897 --> 01:41:07.693
I will recover the load,

01:41:07.693 --> 01:41:09.611
but all I know

01:41:09.611 --> 01:41:13.031
is we don't have our load.
The Americans have our load.

01:41:13.031 --> 01:41:16.994
So I plead with you to look at this.

01:41:21.707 --> 01:41:25.669
Go ahead.

01:41:38.182 --> 01:41:42.186
Do you see this?

01:41:49.067 --> 01:41:53.071
This is not casual.

01:42:40.702 --> 01:42:41.787
Yeah.

01:42:41.787 --> 01:42:44.623
<i>I heard some bad shit happened</i>

01:42:44.623 --> 01:42:48.627
<i>with the crazy whites at a trailer park.</i>

01:42:54.091 --> 01:42:55.884
Cut the crap.

01:42:55.884 --> 01:42:59.888
<i>You got my product, man.</i>

01:43:00.472 --> 01:43:02.224
<i>-You got my money.
-That's right.</i>

01:43:02.224 --> 01:43:04.017
<i>-Here's the deal.
-We have a deal.</i>

01:43:04.017 --> 01:43:07.521
Here's a new deal, cash money.

01:43:07.521 --> 01:43:11.525
Three a ki times 4,000 ki's is 12 mil.

01:43:12.609 --> 01:43:14.111
And we ain't waiting for a back nine.

01:43:14.111 --> 01:43:16.154
We had a different deal.

01:43:16.154 --> 01:43:20.158
This is the only deal, or else
I offload your shit to some other buyer.

01:43:21.743 --> 01:43:25.747
Mail you a refund, maybe.

01:43:28.667 --> 01:43:32.629
Okay, man. Let's do this.

01:43:33.005 --> 01:43:37.009
And I want you there.
None of your peckerwood proxies.

01:43:37.676 --> 01:43:39.720
I'm out of town.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.724
<i>-I'll wait.
-Why?</i>

01:43:44.308 --> 01:43:47.019
'Cause if you're there,

01:43:47.019 --> 01:43:51.023
guarantees it's for real.

01:43:51.023 --> 01:43:52.608
Tomorrow night.

01:43:52.608 --> 01:43:56.612
<i>I be there. We call you with the place.</i>

01:43:56.987 --> 01:44:00.991
You got my number.

01:44:02.159 --> 01:44:06.163
Yeah, well, follow up with the ME,
identify off the DNA samples.

01:44:08.957 --> 01:44:12.586
Yero's coming back to the U.S.
to recover his product.

01:44:12.586 --> 01:44:16.590
He's coming back himself.

01:44:20.052 --> 01:44:21.762
How do we deal? How do we do a deal?

01:44:21.762 --> 01:44:25.766
I mean, how's anybody
gonna believe anybody after tonight?

01:44:25.891 --> 01:44:27.809
Nobody does. He's compelled.

01:44:27.809 --> 01:44:31.813
We got his 4,000 ki's,
worth $60 million at wholesale.

01:44:32.606 --> 01:44:36.610
That's right.

01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:43.784
All right. Now, here's what's gonna happen.

01:44:43.784 --> 01:44:47.788
They will change out the place at
the last minute so we can't set up on them.

01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:51.917
And it'll be an L-shaped ambush.

01:44:51.917 --> 01:44:54.294
I run it.

01:44:54.294 --> 01:44:58.131
I run it.

01:44:58.131 --> 01:45:01.051
They won't initiate
until they got eyes on the product.

01:45:01.051 --> 01:45:05.055
And I won't let the product come in
until we've got their shooters in our sights

01:45:05.264 --> 01:45:08.100
-and you have cover.
-Okay.

01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:12.062
I don't care how much we want this guy.

01:45:13.397 --> 01:45:17.401
-Clear?
-Yeah.

01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:44.887
What shit have you pulled?

01:45:44.887 --> 01:45:47.931
-You know what Jesús will do, right?
-Yes, I do.

01:45:49.016 --> 01:45:53.020
Do you wanna call him?

01:45:57.941 --> 01:46:01.945
You're all mine now.

01:46:12.122 --> 01:46:16.126
-It's that time.
-Yeah.

01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:19.463
Badges get flashed, guns come out.

01:46:19.463 --> 01:46:22.299
Arrests get made.

01:46:22.299 --> 01:46:26.303
That's what we do.

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:27.888
So?

01:46:27.888 --> 01:46:31.892
So, fabricated identity and what's really up

01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:37.189
collapses into one frame.

01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:41.151
You ready for that on this one?

01:46:41.985 --> 01:46:45.989
I absolutely am not.

01:46:49.034 --> 01:46:52.162
So, where you at with that?

01:47:00.921 --> 01:47:04.925
She could be a white collar money manager.
She may even be true love.

01:47:08.428 --> 01:47:12.432
But she's with them.

01:47:13.392 --> 01:47:17.354
Like Trudy would say,

01:47:18.063 --> 01:47:22.025
I ain't playing.

01:47:31.827 --> 01:47:35.038
Time.

01:47:35.038 --> 01:47:39.042
Let's do this.

01:48:05.527 --> 01:48:06.945
Yeah.

01:48:15.579 --> 01:48:17.206
What's up?

01:48:17.206 --> 01:48:19.208
The location got changed.

01:48:19.208 --> 01:48:23.212
Bojean shipyard, 27th and the river.

01:49:17.182 --> 01:49:21.186
I can't find the shooters.

01:49:21.228 --> 01:49:22.521
Stall.

01:49:22.521 --> 01:49:26.483
Copy that.

01:49:33.532 --> 01:49:37.536
-Where's the product?
-Where's the money?

01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:40.163
How do I know
what you say is there, is there?

01:49:40.163 --> 01:49:41.915
Here's how that works,

01:49:41.915 --> 01:49:44.293
somebody from my side
lays eyes on the money.

01:49:44.293 --> 01:49:46.044
Only then do we call in the dope.

01:49:46.044 --> 01:49:48.964
Then somebody from your side
can go look at the product.

01:49:48.964 --> 01:49:52.509
The money's right here,
so send somebody over.

01:49:52.509 --> 01:49:56.513
Can't find the shooter.

01:50:03.562 --> 01:50:05.939
Where's Yero?

01:50:05.939 --> 01:50:08.066
Right here!

01:50:08.066 --> 01:50:12.070
<i>And I brought your friend.
Oye, 'mano, she mine now.</i>

01:50:14.031 --> 01:50:15.657
Jesús gave her to me

01:50:15.657 --> 01:50:19.661
to ask questions
and find out interesting things.

01:50:22.122 --> 01:50:24.249
We a couple now.

01:50:24.249 --> 01:50:28.253
After work, she and me go
catch a movie and grab a bite.

01:50:33.091 --> 01:50:35.260
When I get tired, I throw her away.

01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:38.680
Her leg in one place,
her head someplace else.

01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:42.684
You guys ever see that?

01:50:44.478 --> 01:50:47.105
Anyway, she here now

01:50:47.105 --> 01:50:51.068
to make sure everything go right.

01:51:00.619 --> 01:51:04.623
My guy, show him the money.

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.000
I don't want him!

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.544
Why?

01:51:08.544 --> 01:51:11.296
-What difference does it make, Sonny?
-Listen to me, asshole,

01:51:11.296 --> 01:51:13.465
I do not want that motherfucker near me.

01:51:13.465 --> 01:51:17.427
You wanna see your dope?
You send Isabella.

01:51:18.971 --> 01:51:22.933
Or it travels.

01:51:30.148 --> 01:51:34.111
Stay here, bitch.

01:51:38.115 --> 01:51:42.119
Let her go.

01:51:45.163 --> 01:51:47.416
Check the dope,

01:51:47.416 --> 01:51:51.420
then come right back.

01:52:19.031 --> 01:52:23.035
Got one.

01:52:24.536 --> 01:52:28.540
On the container. Hold it.

01:52:39.301 --> 01:52:41.136
I got number two.

01:52:41.136 --> 01:52:45.140
Port side, third deck,
middle of the superstructure.

01:52:48.185 --> 01:52:52.189
Fire.

01:53:46.535 --> 01:53:50.539
Go!

01:53:54.293 --> 01:53:58.297
Go!

01:54:02.676 --> 01:54:06.680
Go!

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:28.410
Go!

01:54:28.410 --> 01:54:32.414
Move it, man. Run, run, run!

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:18.544
Crockett. I'm on your right.

01:56:31.533 --> 01:56:35.537
Who are you?

01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:44.713
Who are you?

01:57:19.831 --> 01:57:21.625
Get up.

01:57:21.625 --> 01:57:25.629
Get up.

01:57:50.612 --> 01:57:54.157
Get in. Get in!

01:57:59.746 --> 01:58:03.750
-Zito?
-Yeah, he's okay.

01:59:19.868 --> 01:59:23.872
-What is this?
-It's a house we use.

01:59:34.132 --> 01:59:38.136
Gloria? Sonny. Is Frank around?

01:59:40.931 --> 01:59:44.935
All right. Just get him to call me right back.

02:00:22.264 --> 02:00:25.767
A man named Frank
is going to come in a boat.

02:00:25.767 --> 02:00:27.728
He will run you into Cayo Sotavento.

02:00:27.728 --> 02:00:31.732
And from there,
you can find your way to Havana.

02:00:32.274 --> 02:00:36.278
And nobody will follow you.

02:00:38.697 --> 02:00:42.701
Including me.

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:58.008
Remember,

02:00:58.008 --> 02:01:00.928
I said

02:01:00.928 --> 02:01:04.932
time is luck.

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:08.769
Yeah.

02:01:08.769 --> 02:01:12.773
Luck ran out.

02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:20.364
This was too good to last.

02:02:52.206 --> 02:02:56.210
Nurse?
