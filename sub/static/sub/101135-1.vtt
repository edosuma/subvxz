<i>Get down!</i>

01:30.912 --> 01:32.980
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

01:33.014 --> 01:34.248
<i>It's not working!</i>

01:34.982 --> 01:36.184
<i>Medic! Medic!</i>

01:36.217 --> 01:37.453
<i>What's your name?</i>

01:38.953 --> 01:39.854
<i>Gunfire everywhere!</i>

01:42.291 --> 01:43.425
<i>Incoming!</i>

02:32.443 --> 02:33.544
What do you want?

03:15.621 --> 03:16.988
Hey, Butchie.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.424
You got an extra pair
of them socks?

03:18.458 --> 03:20.493
These dogs is
itching me like crazy.

03:20.526 --> 03:22.227
Should've packed two pair.

03:22.261 --> 03:23.663
I did.

03:23.696 --> 03:26.065
Put holes in the first pair
after three days.

03:27.401 --> 03:29.168
Damn it.

03:30.571 --> 03:32.773
I wish I was born flat foot.

03:32.806 --> 03:34.675
My cousin's kid brother
got flat feet,

03:34.708 --> 03:37.277
he found out he couldn't
get into the army.

03:37.311 --> 03:39.078
He hung himself
in my uncle's barn.

03:40.213 --> 03:42.449
You're so full of shit, Kirk.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.751
Your cousin's kid brother's
still your cousin, ain't he?

03:44.785 --> 03:46.118
Why would you
call him anything else?

03:47.621 --> 03:49.324
No kidding, he's my cousin.

03:49.357 --> 03:50.758
Who would lie about that?

03:53.495 --> 03:55.128
Do you even know why you lie?

03:56.397 --> 03:57.665
Who you crackin' wise at?

03:59.334 --> 04:01.603
The outpost
is 30 miles over those hills.

04:02.370 --> 04:03.404
Let's move out.

04:35.236 --> 04:36.339
Feel a jeep comin'.

04:43.145 --> 04:44.614
How many M7s we got?

05:04.869 --> 05:07.538
Maybe we should've
spared that jeep.

05:07.572 --> 05:08.839
Still have
a long way to walk.

05:10.274 --> 05:12.877
Yeah, 'cause it worked out
so well for them.

05:12.910 --> 05:15.479
Nazis ain't
so tough now, are ya?

05:20.183 --> 05:22.453
You ain't gonna be
needing this. Nope.

05:29.561 --> 05:32.631
Hey, Butchie, keep your eyes out
for any maps, coded messages,

05:32.664 --> 05:34.533
anything we can use
against these guys.

05:34.566 --> 05:35.867
What do you
think I'm doing?

05:48.615 --> 05:50.650
Hey, Butchie,
we got a live one.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.722
You want I should
reel him in?

05:55.755 --> 05:57.155
Or throw him back?

05:57.189 --> 05:59.559
He's a major. That'll do.

06:01.259 --> 06:02.729
Let's go, Jerry,
put up your dukes.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.666
<i>♪ When you're smilin'</i>

06:08.534 --> 06:10.870
<i>♪ Oh, when you're smilin'</i>

06:10.903 --> 06:13.474
<i>♪ The whole world smiles...</i>

06:13.507 --> 06:14.908
<i>♪ ...with you... ♪</i>

06:19.380 --> 06:20.714
Huh?

06:20.748 --> 06:22.215
Huh?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.285
Shut up, Eugene.

06:25.319 --> 06:28.489
Scruff fuck knows exactly
what I'm saying. Huh?

06:48.443 --> 06:49.444
Huh?

06:50.612 --> 06:51.613
All right.

06:56.818 --> 06:59.354
- Huh? All right.
- Yeah.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.729
Hey,
look at Rocky Graziano.

07:11.867 --> 07:14.537
Mother Mary, this guy is good.

07:14.570 --> 07:16.906
Nearest crossing now
is two miles over that hill.

07:16.939 --> 07:18.340
Go get him, Butchie.

07:19.475 --> 07:21.677
Yep.

07:21.711 --> 07:23.546
Come on, you're swinging
like a ding-a-ling.

07:34.758 --> 07:38.428
Sorry, guys, we're way behind.
Think I made a wrong turn.

07:38.462 --> 07:39.463
Pack up.

09:14.461 --> 09:15.696
I won't hurt you.

09:18.032 --> 09:19.366
It's okay.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.478
Take it.

10:26.737 --> 10:28.939
<i>Feels like
my feet are gonna fall off.</i>

10:28.972 --> 10:30.474
<i>Once we get there,
it'll be cake.</i>

10:31.141 --> 10:32.709
You guys can sleep for days.

10:33.810 --> 10:35.513
Who we babysitting
this time?

10:35.546 --> 10:36.781
Not a "who."

10:36.814 --> 10:39.183
A mansion or a castle.

10:39.217 --> 10:40.451
It's supposed to be a big deal

10:40.485 --> 10:41.719
when the 82nd Airborne
came through

10:41.753 --> 10:44.489
and pushed out
the Nazi High Command.

10:44.522 --> 10:46.691
We're to hold it
till our relief comes.

10:46.724 --> 10:49.560
- How long is that?
- As long as it takes.

10:49.594 --> 10:53.498
Yowza, yowza, yowza.
Clean sheets and toilet paper.

10:59.905 --> 11:02.541
No wonder the Nazis
commandeered it.

11:03.609 --> 11:06.879
Yeah. What's not to love?

11:17.890 --> 11:19.491
Maybe he's just sleeping.

11:19.525 --> 11:21.593
Yeah, not enough rooms.

11:23.195 --> 11:24.965
Easy, little,
your relief is here.

11:24.998 --> 11:27.067
You fall asleep star gazing
or something?

11:28.969 --> 11:30.937
Get your gear.
Our relief is here.

11:34.975 --> 11:36.876
I think I died
and gone to heaven, boys.

11:36.910 --> 11:37.944
Man, you kidding me?

11:37.978 --> 11:39.012
Look at this.

11:39.045 --> 11:40.847
This place is as big
as Roseland.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.949
It's bigger than my whole
neighborhood in Queens.

11:42.983 --> 11:45.185
Okay, gear up and fall in.
We're out in two minutes.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.155
- Wow.
- What's the hurry?

11:48.189 --> 11:49.056
There's no hurry.

11:49.090 --> 11:50.891
Why aren't you all
sleeping in the beds?

11:52.093 --> 11:53.561
It don't have bedbugs
or something?

11:53.594 --> 11:56.163
Yeah, bedbugs.

11:56.197 --> 11:58.132
We put most of the mattresses
in the basement.

12:00.034 --> 12:01.202
What's the story,
morning glory?

12:02.304 --> 12:04.038
Any news on that thing?

12:04.071 --> 12:05.573
No.

12:05.606 --> 12:07.274
Uh, it doesn't
pick up much out here.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.276
Must be broken.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.880
Broken, huh?
Maybe you should leave it with us.

12:13.682 --> 12:16.118
Eugene there is a regular
Marconian with a screwdriver.

12:21.357 --> 12:22.557
Yeah.

12:24.192 --> 12:25.193
Yeah.

12:27.929 --> 12:29.898
- Can I go now?
- Not yet.

12:35.605 --> 12:37.240
Where's the grub?

12:37.273 --> 12:39.275
This place was
a crowd base for operations,

12:39.309 --> 12:41.210
they stacked the pantry
full of sausage, cheeses,

12:41.244 --> 12:43.079
wine and all the brandy
that you can drink.

12:43.112 --> 12:44.814
Supply truck comes through
to re-up in a week.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.849
They'll have fresh bread
and K-rations.

12:46.883 --> 12:48.084
So what's wrong with the joint?

12:49.752 --> 12:51.654
I mean, if this place
is like Coney Island,

12:51.687 --> 12:52.722
what's the rush?

12:52.755 --> 12:54.223
You're a day late.

12:54.257 --> 12:55.958
We're behind schedule.
And some of us would like

12:55.992 --> 12:57.660
to make furlough,
okay, asshole?

13:06.036 --> 13:07.037
Let's go.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.988
One of them left
their rucksack behind.

13:30.962 --> 13:32.364
What do you mean
you never had fondue?

13:32.398 --> 13:33.698
Were you raised in a brothel?

13:33.731 --> 13:36.668
Give him pots and pans
and his <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy.</i>

13:39.270 --> 13:41.639
Hey, how far's the nearest
cat house anyway?

13:41.673 --> 13:43.942
Heard the French girls
are cut sideways.

13:43.975 --> 13:47.178
It's the Jap girls that are
cut sideways, ya ding-a-ling.

13:49.048 --> 13:50.783
I don't see why
we should be on lockdown.

13:50.816 --> 13:52.151
We could be here all week.

13:52.184 --> 13:53.819
I'm gonna take a look
around the house.

13:58.858 --> 13:59.859
How about a fondue?

14:02.094 --> 14:03.095
Eugene!

14:04.029 --> 14:05.030
The cheese!

16:37.189 --> 16:38.458
Boo.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.539
This is the life, boys.

19:34.708 --> 19:35.709
What?

19:36.610 --> 19:37.611
Is that any good?

19:39.045 --> 19:41.080
Oh, yeah,
it's about a machine

19:41.113 --> 19:42.382
that's supposed
to be a mental portal

19:42.416 --> 19:43.684
between dimensions,
but it turns out,

19:43.717 --> 19:46.052
it's also a portal
between times.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.622
You could've just said no.

19:57.732 --> 19:59.667
Break's over.

20:44.246 --> 20:45.415
What the hell is that?

21:45.811 --> 21:47.880
Geez, what the fuck?

22:05.263 --> 22:07.500
Three, two, one.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.209
What the hell was that?

22:16.644 --> 22:17.778
You saw it, too?

22:20.881 --> 22:22.248
Not sure what I saw.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.793
Earl Grey?

22:38.867 --> 22:40.035
It's true.

22:40.068 --> 22:43.405
My cousin's letter says,
"They're treating SPOW as well.

22:44.271 --> 22:45.106
"The food ain't so bad.

22:45.140 --> 22:46.841
"And we get to play
baseball all day.

22:47.876 --> 22:49.778
"I love you.

22:49.811 --> 22:51.646
"And I can't wait to see you
after the war."

22:53.548 --> 22:55.550
And then at the bottom
in the letter, he writes,

22:55.583 --> 22:58.688
"P.S., save this stamp
for Uncle Harold."

23:00.623 --> 23:02.491
Except there is no Uncle Harold
in the family.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.429
So we analyzed steams
off the stamp.

23:06.462 --> 23:07.730
All curious, you know.

23:09.398 --> 23:11.299
And underneath,

23:11.333 --> 23:13.636
written in small letters,
five words...

23:16.038 --> 23:17.606
"They've cut out my tongue."

23:17.640 --> 23:18.641
God.

23:28.719 --> 23:29.720
What's that?

23:30.687 --> 23:32.456
Ah, I found it in the basement.

23:32.489 --> 23:35.325
Belonged to one of the Nazis
who took over the house.

23:35.358 --> 23:37.661
Dieter Werner. 18 years old.

23:38.662 --> 23:39.863
Nazi shithead.

23:41.531 --> 23:43.299
You guys remember Louis
from Bravo Company,

23:43.333 --> 23:45.301
the ginger from the pig farm?

23:45.335 --> 23:46.603
How that old whore
stole his money roll,

23:46.637 --> 23:48.005
locked herself
in the bathroom?

23:48.039 --> 23:49.272
What about her?

23:49.306 --> 23:51.409
He hears glass breaking,
she starts screaming bloody murder,

23:51.442 --> 23:52.877
so he starts
pounding on the door,

23:52.910 --> 23:54.779
trying to break in,
but the door's solid.

23:55.980 --> 23:58.382
And for a couple of minutes,
he gets through.

23:58.416 --> 24:00.685
Sees a broken window,
the woman's ear in the sink,

24:00.718 --> 24:03.688
and written in the vanity
in lipstick,

24:03.721 --> 24:06.424
"Welcome to the wonderful
world of the clap."

24:10.595 --> 24:13.332
You're
so full of shit, Butchie.

24:25.778 --> 24:26.779
Do you hear that?

24:29.047 --> 24:30.849
I hope it doesn't
do that all night.

24:30.883 --> 24:32.518
I might have to sleep outside.

24:32.551 --> 24:34.453
You should
if you're gonna read crap.

24:34.486 --> 24:35.488
Well...

24:36.923 --> 24:38.491
I could see
why they left it behind.

24:38.525 --> 24:40.693
It says what happened
to the family who lived here.

24:40.727 --> 24:42.629
And what he did to them.

24:42.662 --> 24:44.964
Guys, I think I'm going cuckoo.

24:44.998 --> 24:47.033
Is that Morse Code?

24:58.779 --> 25:00.047
I...

25:00.080 --> 25:01.081
H...

25:02.383 --> 25:03.617
A...

25:03.651 --> 25:04.652
V...

25:05.486 --> 25:06.487
E...

25:07.054 --> 25:08.455
N...

25:08.489 --> 25:09.523
O...

25:09.557 --> 25:10.825
Bullshit.

25:10.858 --> 25:11.859
L...

25:12.993 --> 25:13.994
E...

25:15.563 --> 25:16.564
G...

25:18.432 --> 25:19.433
S.

25:19.867 --> 25:21.402
"I have no legs"?

25:31.713 --> 25:32.814
Jesus.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.425
Oh.

25:46.428 --> 25:47.763
Get rid of that.
It's covered in disease.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.932
Tsk. Who you supposed
to be, my momma?

25:50.766 --> 25:51.767
Stop.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.070
That was bullshit, right?

25:55.805 --> 25:57.640
Tappert,
take the attic tonight.

25:57.673 --> 25:59.609
Best vantage point
if there's any conflict.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.446
We can all sleep
in a bed tonight.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.047
And stay within
shouting distance.

26:05.081 --> 26:06.515
Until we know
what the fuck's happening.

26:48.860 --> 26:49.861
Come on.

26:50.962 --> 26:51.963
Open up.

27:25.031 --> 27:26.132
Shit.

29:55.988 --> 29:58.724
So, anyone wanna
talk about last night?

30:17.043 --> 30:20.046
These boys seem like
they wanted out in a hurry.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.249
Ever find out
whose rucksack that was?

30:22.282 --> 30:23.750
Tappert's going through it.

30:24.718 --> 30:26.086
Think he'll find any gold teeth?

30:27.287 --> 30:28.688
He gives me the shivers.

30:29.624 --> 30:31.758
- I mean, after Paris...
- Drop it, you two.

30:31.791 --> 30:34.194
You didn't find them sitting
in a pool of blood.

30:34.227 --> 30:37.765
Six or seven 15-year-olds
all... carved up.

30:37.798 --> 30:38.833
Hitler Youth.

30:38.866 --> 30:40.168
Guts all on the floor.

30:40.201 --> 30:41.336
And he's sitting there,
you know,

30:41.370 --> 30:43.070
with that look he gets.

30:43.905 --> 30:45.474
That weird smile...

30:45.507 --> 30:47.975
And telling me
they were smuggling diamonds.

30:48.009 --> 30:49.043
He showed you
any diamonds?

30:49.076 --> 30:50.745
What do you think?

30:50.778 --> 30:52.146
Have I ever told you guys
this part?

30:52.180 --> 30:54.048
He holds up his hands.

30:54.081 --> 30:55.850
He's got string
around his fingers.

30:55.883 --> 30:57.051
You know, a cat's cradle?

30:57.885 --> 30:58.887
And he just goes...

31:01.089 --> 31:02.191
"Your move."

31:06.895 --> 31:08.096
All dreamily.

31:08.130 --> 31:11.066
Okay. That's a little laggy.

31:11.099 --> 31:13.101
One last thing
to pull your coat to.

31:13.135 --> 31:14.470
It wasn't the first move.

31:17.340 --> 31:18.408
You know, like, a cat's cradle,

31:18.441 --> 31:20.709
the first 10 moves are easy
and then it gets hard.

31:21.377 --> 31:23.213
So...

31:23.246 --> 31:25.449
who helped him get
to move five

31:25.482 --> 31:27.317
in a room full of dead kids?

31:34.891 --> 31:36.192
Glad he's on our side.

31:43.866 --> 31:46.338
I think I figured out
what put the bee in the bonnets

31:46.371 --> 31:48.272
of the last squad
that was here.

31:53.177 --> 31:56.013
Radio said there's
a German line coming through

31:56.046 --> 31:58.516
from Nuremberg
to some kind of camp,

31:58.550 --> 32:01.218
in... in Strasbourg.

32:02.319 --> 32:03.854
There's some trucks.

32:03.887 --> 32:06.023
Maybe a couple dozen
Jerries on foot.

32:07.324 --> 32:08.493
Shit.

32:08.526 --> 32:10.829
Look, I say we gear up,

32:10.862 --> 32:13.098
head into those woods
and wait for 'em to pass.

32:13.131 --> 32:15.534
We stay here,
we're fish in a barrel.

32:17.235 --> 32:18.870
We can't leave.

32:18.903 --> 32:21.440
Five guys against 50.

32:21.474 --> 32:23.376
- It's plain suicide.
- We're staying.

32:30.081 --> 32:32.217
Great. Okay.

32:32.250 --> 32:35.589
Well, then I guess I'll just go up to
the attic and try to spot 'em then.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.323
Either of you wanna
maybe come help?

32:38.858 --> 32:39.859
Eugene?

32:43.597 --> 32:44.797
Come on.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.567
We can play cat's cradle.

32:58.111 --> 33:00.515
Not talking about people
not in the room.

33:00.548 --> 33:01.549
What?

33:05.453 --> 33:07.020
What the hell is that?

33:08.088 --> 33:09.189
Black magic.

33:11.191 --> 33:13.193
Sacrificial altars.

33:16.129 --> 33:18.566
They say Hitler is
a big believer in the occult.

33:20.568 --> 33:22.371
They say, huh?

33:22.404 --> 33:25.507
The Nazis must've committed
ritualistic killings on the Helwigs.

33:31.447 --> 33:32.614
Sick pervs.

33:34.982 --> 33:35.983
Hey.

33:36.552 --> 33:37.553
Give me a hand, will you?

33:50.700 --> 33:52.000
You wanna take it over there?

33:52.034 --> 33:53.035
Yeah, okay.

33:53.969 --> 33:55.338
Got it. I got it.

33:55.372 --> 33:56.406
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.608
One...

34:08.083 --> 34:10.420
Oh, fuck! You motherfucker!

34:10.454 --> 34:11.987
Hey, that wasn't me.

34:12.021 --> 34:14.157
Get away from me!

34:15.024 --> 34:16.627
God.

34:31.174 --> 34:32.208
You hear that?

34:41.453 --> 34:45.489
<i>...burning for eternity.
They're coming for you.</i>

34:45.524 --> 34:46.725
<i>We steal joy...</i>

34:46.757 --> 34:48.693
What is that?

34:48.726 --> 34:51.929
<i>...falls apart
and reap your memories.</i>

34:55.467 --> 34:57.134
I don't believe in witches,

34:57.168 --> 34:59.372
but if an old hag flies around
on a broom stick...

34:59.405 --> 35:01.507
Please tell me we're having
this conversation right now.

35:01.541 --> 35:03.543
- I thought I was going batshit.
- Yeah, me, too.

35:03.576 --> 35:05.711
Now I know why the last bunch
was so desperate to amscray.

35:05.745 --> 35:07.680
I mean, this place is...

35:07.713 --> 35:08.714
Haunted.

35:10.349 --> 35:12.117
Unless someone's got
a better word for it.

35:12.150 --> 35:15.555
Look, before the Nazis come,
we should, like, 23 skidoo.

35:24.398 --> 35:25.566
What is that?

35:43.182 --> 35:44.217
I...

35:44.250 --> 35:45.251
F...

35:45.686 --> 35:46.688
Y...

35:47.321 --> 35:48.389
O...

35:48.423 --> 35:49.457
U...

35:49.491 --> 35:50.625
"If you..." L...

35:51.325 --> 35:53.093
E... God!

35:53.126 --> 35:54.729
A-V...

35:54.762 --> 35:56.330
"If you leave..."

35:59.534 --> 36:01.034
Eugene, what the...

36:01.068 --> 36:02.202
What the fuck is happening?

36:02.236 --> 36:03.404
I'm not writing!

36:03.438 --> 36:05.339
I'm not writing! Ah!

36:05.373 --> 36:06.407
Fuck!

36:07.307 --> 36:09.076
<i>If you leave,</i>

36:09.109 --> 36:10.446
<i>you'll die!</i>

36:31.099 --> 36:32.200
What?

36:36.773 --> 36:40.410
It'd be nice if someone left something
in these we can actually use.

36:42.177 --> 36:43.480
I'm gonna go
padlock the front door

36:43.513 --> 36:45.348
and make them think that
we abandoned the place.

36:45.382 --> 36:46.650
If they come in
looking for food...

36:47.651 --> 36:49.051
not our first rodeo.

37:42.441 --> 37:43.475
Thanks.

38:33.795 --> 38:34.929
Okay, they're moving on.

38:35.664 --> 38:36.698
They're moving on.

38:39.801 --> 38:41.436
Fuck.

38:45.774 --> 38:47.776
- Damn it!
- That son of a bitch.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.565
Grenade!

39:09.598 --> 39:10.800
Butchie, no!

39:27.651 --> 39:29.318
Eugene!

39:29.352 --> 39:31.354
- Chris!
- Come on!

39:31.988 --> 39:33.356
Where are you?

39:34.591 --> 39:37.594
Chris, we need to cover!
We need to cover from the back!

39:38.762 --> 39:40.262
He's not here!

39:40.296 --> 39:42.666
We're coming to get you.
Where are you?

39:42.699 --> 39:43.934
Chris, where are you?

39:53.845 --> 39:54.879
Come fast!

40:01.486 --> 40:02.487
Out here!

40:05.890 --> 40:07.391
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

40:07.425 --> 40:08.726
Shit! Fuck!

43:31.771 --> 43:33.540
No!

43:53.594 --> 43:54.862
This isn't real.

43:54.895 --> 43:56.530
This isn't real.

44:38.174 --> 44:40.309
Always gotta be the hero.

44:40.343 --> 44:42.078
How much morphine
we have left?

44:43.179 --> 44:44.614
Enough to do the job...

44:45.648 --> 44:46.916
if we have to.

44:47.884 --> 44:49.852
Take this trash out
with the rest of 'em.

45:00.264 --> 45:02.032
What the hell did you do?

45:07.037 --> 45:08.705
You wouldn't understand it.

45:11.642 --> 45:13.677
Strip him down
and put him with the rest.

45:23.254 --> 45:25.690
What the hell
does haunted even mean?

45:25.723 --> 45:27.926
Does that mean
specific people have ghosts

45:27.959 --> 45:30.695
that are somehow anchored
to the places they died?

45:30.728 --> 45:33.031
Or is it the places
where evil's occurred

45:33.064 --> 45:35.834
that makes the portal
to demonic forces?

45:35.867 --> 45:38.670
Or was evil simply a manmade
concept in the first place?

45:38.703 --> 45:41.239
Will you
give it a rest already?

45:41.272 --> 45:43.341
Look, evil is just...

45:46.979 --> 45:49.782
Well, it's what makes
the violence so much fun.

45:51.684 --> 45:52.852
Everything we experienced,

45:52.885 --> 45:55.754
it's what what the Nazis did
to the family that lived here.

45:55.788 --> 45:56.989
The Helwigs,

45:57.022 --> 45:58.425
despite their French
royal lineage,

45:58.458 --> 45:59.959
were hiding Jews.

45:59.992 --> 46:02.695
So, the house
fell into Nazi hands.

46:02.728 --> 46:03.796
And when the Nazis
finally came,

46:03.829 --> 46:05.297
they smashed the doors down

46:05.331 --> 46:07.099
and the children ran and hid.

46:07.133 --> 46:10.804
But Mr. Helwig was found
right here in the library.

46:10.837 --> 46:12.873
So, the Nazis
tied him to a chair.

46:12.906 --> 46:15.742
Mrs. Helwig was hiding
in the kitchen pantry.

46:15.775 --> 46:18.446
So they dragged her upstairs
where they found her son

46:18.479 --> 46:20.714
hiding in the armoire
in the attic.

46:20.747 --> 46:24.217
<i>They drowned her boy
in the upstairs bathtub</i>

46:24.251 --> 46:26.286
and forced her to watch
at gunpoint.

46:26.319 --> 46:27.754
They found the daughter

46:27.787 --> 46:30.090
hiding in the servants'
quarters. Cristina.

46:30.123 --> 46:32.159
So they dragged her
upstairs to the attic

46:32.192 --> 46:35.196
<i>and hanged her
from the rafters.</i>

46:35.229 --> 46:38.032
They carried the screaming mom
down to the library

46:38.065 --> 46:40.369
where they had soaked
her husband in kerosene,

46:40.402 --> 46:42.737
laughing as they
set him on fire.

46:45.907 --> 46:47.775
They tossed their bodies
in a heap.

46:48.209 --> 46:49.810
No funerals,

46:49.844 --> 46:51.245
no headstones.

46:51.279 --> 46:53.214
Is that why they're,
you know,

46:53.981 --> 46:55.816
still here?

46:55.850 --> 46:58.488
No Christian burial,
that sort of thing?

46:58.521 --> 47:00.756
Wandering the Earth
with unfinished business?

47:04.293 --> 47:05.961
I'm gonna go
check on Butchie.

47:09.399 --> 47:11.867
It's all right, bro.

47:50.241 --> 47:51.509
Put it away.

47:53.445 --> 47:55.480
My father was a milkman.

48:00.150 --> 48:03.120
My mother was my dead mother
now a memory.

48:04.355 --> 48:06.857
I always had a thing
for scary movies.

48:07.358 --> 48:08.359
You know?

48:10.328 --> 48:12.864
<i>Abbott and Costello
Meet the Mummy.</i>

48:12.897 --> 48:15.233
<i>I Was a Teenage Werewolf.</i>

48:16.968 --> 48:18.103
Kids stuff.

48:21.006 --> 48:22.541
The scarier, the better.

48:28.481 --> 48:31.349
After Normandy,
I've seen and...

48:33.553 --> 48:35.121
Done things.

48:49.068 --> 48:51.837
Did I ever tell you how
I didn't sleep for five days

48:51.871 --> 48:53.939
when I marched
through Stuttgart?

48:58.345 --> 48:59.514
Five days.

49:01.114 --> 49:05.520
They say it's not possible
without losing your mind.

49:05.553 --> 49:11.191
I couldn't tell if I was
dreaming or awake after three.

49:11.224 --> 49:14.495
And in my more lucid moments,
I wondered if I was ever gonna

49:16.163 --> 49:17.964
get back to normal again.

49:24.238 --> 49:26.442
What I did
to those Hitler Youth kids

49:26.475 --> 49:28.544
was a fucking nightmare.

49:28.577 --> 49:31.946
And I admit it,
I got the control.

49:31.979 --> 49:34.849
I wanted to kill the eggs
before they hatched.

49:35.950 --> 49:38.052
It was like floating
above my body,

49:38.086 --> 49:39.987
looking down on myself

49:40.021 --> 49:43.592
when I cut that little
blond boy's head off.

49:43.625 --> 49:45.994
It was like
I wasn't doing it at all.

49:50.433 --> 49:53.302
I mean, I remember just...

49:53.335 --> 49:55.904
watching myself sitting there
when that...

49:57.973 --> 50:00.410
that body just got up
off the ground.

50:04.714 --> 50:06.583
Total insanity.

50:08.150 --> 50:11.321
Fever dream.

50:11.354 --> 50:13.657
And then he pulled a piece
of string out of his pocket,

50:13.691 --> 50:17.360
that... body without
a head, and...

50:17.395 --> 50:20.464
and he held his hands out
and he made a cat's cradle,

50:20.498 --> 50:23.401
and... and what am I gonna do?
I just cut...

50:24.468 --> 50:28.204
his fucking head off,
Am I gonna be rude?

50:33.076 --> 50:35.212
So I played with him
for a while.

50:40.251 --> 50:41.620
And then he just

50:42.754 --> 50:44.321
laid back down.

50:49.594 --> 50:52.464
I'm pretty sure it was...
it was a dream.

50:56.668 --> 50:59.337
I was just...
I was just too scared to move.

51:01.072 --> 51:04.710
So I sat there holding
that cat's cradle for hours

51:04.744 --> 51:07.979
until you came and you
found me with the bodies.

51:13.419 --> 51:16.254
I completely forgot that
that ever happened.

51:20.626 --> 51:23.196
- Yesterday I reminded you.
- Yeah.

51:38.679 --> 51:40.614
Kirk, you forgot
to drain the tub.

52:12.548 --> 52:14.215
I'm here to help you.

52:59.129 --> 53:00.297
Let go!

53:02.198 --> 53:03.401
Hey.

53:04.769 --> 53:07.070
It's another dream, man.

53:16.279 --> 53:17.615
How much longer can you go
without food?

53:20.618 --> 53:22.353
So what're we gonna do, Chris?

53:22.387 --> 53:23.855
No one wants to stay here
another night.

53:23.889 --> 53:25.824
We'll be court-martialed
for deserting our posts.

53:27.659 --> 53:29.027
Hey, Tap.

53:29.061 --> 53:31.730
Do you think you could find that
Nazi truck again if you had to?

53:31.763 --> 53:34.265
I mean, it wouldn't matter.
I slashed the tires.

53:37.536 --> 53:39.337
Maybe our relief will come soon.

53:44.175 --> 53:46.211
All right, Butch.

53:46.244 --> 53:49.782
The next bit is about quantum
entanglement. Dullsville.

53:49.816 --> 53:53.620
"And then the Martian visitor
explained that the deeds from one life

53:53.653 --> 53:56.355
"are carried with you
into the next.

53:56.389 --> 53:59.759
"So reincarnation from
Martians..."

54:11.772 --> 54:13.641
What are we looking for, anyway?

54:13.674 --> 54:15.174
I don't know.

54:15.208 --> 54:17.377
Memoirs, dairies,

54:17.411 --> 54:19.613
anything that really belonged
to the Helwigs.

54:31.992 --> 54:33.795
Oh, fuck a duck.

54:33.828 --> 54:34.863
You got your Zippo?

54:34.896 --> 54:36.296
Yeah, upstairs.

55:08.329 --> 55:09.565
Studying German?

55:25.048 --> 55:26.917
You sure there isn't anything
you wanna tell me?

55:37.627 --> 55:39.029
Is anyone down there?

55:39.062 --> 55:40.362
What's up?

55:40.397 --> 55:41.765
Get your asses up here now!

55:41.798 --> 55:43.332
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

55:43.365 --> 55:44.969
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

55:45.002 --> 55:46.571
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

55:46.604 --> 55:47.905
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

55:47.939 --> 55:49.607
- Where's the damn morphine?
- This isn't real!

55:49.640 --> 55:51.008
- Eugene, morphine!
- This isn't real!

55:51.042 --> 55:52.910
It's in the medical kit.

55:52.944 --> 55:55.680
This isn't real!
It was us! It was us!

55:55.713 --> 55:57.314
It was us! It was us!
It was us!

55:57.347 --> 55:59.249
- What was us? What was us?
- It was us! It was us!

56:07.492 --> 56:08.894
Remember.

56:30.015 --> 56:31.382
Come downstairs.

56:32.852 --> 56:33.953
We need to talk.

56:45.799 --> 56:47.734
We're not staying another night.

56:47.767 --> 56:48.902
I'm not saying
we abandon post,

56:48.935 --> 56:50.837
but maybe take a new position
in the woods or something.

56:50.870 --> 56:53.973
Just frankly, my dear,
fuck the court-martial.

56:54.007 --> 56:55.842
This place is bad juju.

57:00.047 --> 57:01.649
I think we should give him
a proper burial.

57:01.682 --> 57:03.017
- Oh.
- Send him off to heaven.

57:03.050 --> 57:04.084
Or the other place.

57:04.118 --> 57:06.020
Does the journal say
where the bodies are dumped?

57:07.154 --> 57:08.556
Let me see the journal.

57:16.931 --> 57:18.065
I don't understand.

57:18.098 --> 57:19.466
No kidding. It's in German.

57:19.500 --> 57:20.969
You could barely order
champagne in Paris.

57:21.002 --> 57:22.771
Does Dieter say
where they put the bodies?

57:22.804 --> 57:24.039
I'll check, okay?

57:24.072 --> 57:26.575
But right now, let's get out
of this house.

57:26.608 --> 57:28.543
And you're all willing
to die in a military prison?

57:32.147 --> 57:33.380
Yes.

57:36.918 --> 57:39.588
I want everyone geared up and
ready to clear out. Double time.

58:20.797 --> 58:21.899
All right.

58:21.932 --> 58:23.100
We better get
our stories straight

58:23.133 --> 58:24.835
before we get to base camp.

58:24.868 --> 58:27.971
Like, "the German soldiers
burned the castle down."

58:29.673 --> 58:31.541
That story ain't gonna
seem so straight

58:31.575 --> 58:33.444
when they find the place
in one piece.

58:34.145 --> 58:35.747
Maybe we should've torched it.

58:36.648 --> 58:37.815
Maybe it wouldn't let us.

59:20.894 --> 59:22.462
Do we keep going?

59:24.631 --> 59:26.666
We could, uh,
flip a coin, I guess.

59:36.676 --> 59:39.546
You guys ever read <i>An
Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge?</i>

59:39.579 --> 59:41.948
The entire story takes place

59:41.982 --> 59:43.850
in the mind of the guy
hanging from a noose?

59:44.685 --> 59:46.153
We're dead.

59:46.187 --> 59:48.756
Heaven fucking sucks.

59:48.789 --> 59:50.057
Unless it's the other place.

59:52.326 --> 59:53.995
Well, that's what
they say, right?

59:54.762 --> 59:55.997
Hell is repetition?

59:56.030 --> 59:57.765
You know, most cultures have
a version of hell

59:57.798 --> 01:00:01.268
where the dead relive their sins
over and over for eternity.

01:00:01.302 --> 01:00:02.670
Just trapped in a loop.

01:00:31.933 --> 01:00:33.302
This ain't right, man.

01:00:36.906 --> 01:00:38.074
Let's just turn around.

01:01:20.785 --> 01:01:22.787
I just realized...

01:01:22.821 --> 01:01:25.256
I haven't taken a shit
since I can remember.

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:27.292
That's a classic pick-up line.

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:29.160
Neither have I.

01:01:29.994 --> 01:01:31.262
For, like, weeks.

01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:32.864
That's not possible, right?

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:33.998
No, it's not.

01:01:34.699 --> 01:01:37.102
Situation normal, all fucked up.

01:01:37.135 --> 01:01:38.336
Snafu, all right.

01:01:40.138 --> 01:01:42.740
Okay, I'm just gonna say
what we're all thinking.

01:01:42.774 --> 01:01:44.643
If we march tomorrow
and return...

01:01:44.677 --> 01:01:45.811
One day at a time.

01:01:48.047 --> 01:01:49.615
Like the drunk said.

01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:02.157
This ain't right, man.

01:03:05.428 --> 01:03:06.895
Let's just turn around.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.329
Maybe the compass is broken.

01:03:40.129 --> 01:03:41.965
Yeah, map, too.

01:03:41.998 --> 01:03:43.434
It won't let us leave.

01:03:45.936 --> 01:03:47.171
What if...

01:03:47.204 --> 01:03:50.140
What if we gave him a proper
burial and all, like you said?

01:03:51.375 --> 01:03:53.043
Did the journal 20
the body dump?

01:03:54.812 --> 01:03:56.247
The last page was missing.

01:04:06.924 --> 01:04:08.994
We need to communicate
with the spirits.

01:04:09.027 --> 01:04:11.196
Find out where the remains are.

01:04:11.229 --> 01:04:13.265
Are you baking them a cake?

01:04:13.298 --> 01:04:15.967
Footsteps.
I want to see where they go.

01:04:20.005 --> 01:04:22.240
<i>Vetrulek.</i>

01:04:22.274 --> 01:04:23.375
Where'd you hear that word?

01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:25.143
Hmm?

01:04:25.176 --> 01:04:26.211
<i>Vetrulek?</i>

01:04:26.244 --> 01:04:27.812
It's just something
that's been...

01:04:29.582 --> 01:04:31.517
...floating around my head.

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:33.119
Triple word score on that one.

01:04:33.152 --> 01:04:34.854
No, Dieter mentions that word.

01:04:34.887 --> 01:04:36.956
It's an old Muslim belief.

01:04:36.989 --> 01:04:41.495
Uh, "If you let evil happen,
it could come back to haunt you tenfold."

01:04:41.528 --> 01:04:44.897
Like all that's required for evil
to triumph is a good man do nothing.

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:47.133
Yeah, but more like a curse.

01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:48.968
Why would Tappert
know that word?

01:06:20.163 --> 01:06:21.965
What do you want?

01:06:23.199 --> 01:06:25.001
Guys, help!

01:06:30.641 --> 01:06:32.309
Guys, help!

01:06:33.445 --> 01:06:34.713
Shoot her!

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.015
Fucking shoot her!

01:06:38.048 --> 01:06:39.116
Help! Help!

01:06:41.453 --> 01:06:43.387
- Shoot her!
- Shoot what?

01:06:47.324 --> 01:06:48.359
Shoot her!

01:06:48.392 --> 01:06:49.994
Fucking shoot her!

01:06:58.136 --> 01:06:59.204
No!

01:07:09.281 --> 01:07:10.315
Flank left!

01:07:11.416 --> 01:07:12.685
Chris, we're coming in!

01:07:12.718 --> 01:07:14.487
One, two, three!

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:52.484
They're here.

01:08:14.007 --> 01:08:15.508
What is it?

01:08:16.742 --> 01:08:18.444
It's the last page
of the journal.

01:09:32.322 --> 01:09:34.024
Done.

01:09:34.057 --> 01:09:35.191
We should pray or something.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.895
This makes no sense.

01:09:39.929 --> 01:09:41.264
What?

01:09:41.296 --> 01:09:44.067
The Helwigs weren't French,
they were Afghans.

01:09:47.171 --> 01:09:50.174
Yeah, this family,
they hid dozens of Jews in the walls here,

01:09:50.207 --> 01:09:52.943
and spent a fortune providing
them safe passage to America.

01:09:55.046 --> 01:09:59.083
They risked their lives collaborating against
the Nazis for as long as they could.

01:09:59.116 --> 01:10:00.550
Since when do you know Arabic?

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.621
What else does it say?

01:10:04.654 --> 01:10:07.892
Uh, just before she died, Mrs.
Helwig performed the <i>vetrul</i> curse

01:10:07.925 --> 01:10:10.162
against the men who just
stood by and watched.

01:10:10.195 --> 01:10:12.230
Just haunting them to the grave.

01:10:12.264 --> 01:10:15.200
Can we just focus on one
fucking thing for two seconds?

01:10:17.936 --> 01:10:18.937
Let's finish it.

01:10:26.878 --> 01:10:28.113
Ashes to ashes,

01:10:28.813 --> 01:10:30.848
dust to dust.

01:10:30.882 --> 01:10:33.286
As I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

01:10:33.319 --> 01:10:34.854
I fear no evil...

01:10:39.025 --> 01:10:42.161
Court-martial my ass for all I
care, as long as it's not here.

01:10:42.195 --> 01:10:43.329
Amen to that.

01:10:44.363 --> 01:10:46.165
Hey, give me a hand with this.

01:10:52.004 --> 01:10:53.973
Whoa! Slowly.

01:10:54.006 --> 01:10:55.041
Could be booby-trapped.

01:11:07.687 --> 01:11:08.688
Cigars?

01:11:09.289 --> 01:11:10.756
Locked in a trunk?

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:12.059
Gotta be worth something.

01:11:12.092 --> 01:11:13.961
Whatever.
Let's clear out in five.

01:11:14.827 --> 01:11:16.396
Hold on a second.

01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:19.433
Dieter mentions something
about a trunk in his last entry,

01:11:19.466 --> 01:11:21.870
and once the Nazis opened it,
his entries stopped.

01:11:26.207 --> 01:11:29.210
- What now?
- It's, like, some of the words are different.

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:31.045
Like, it...
It says something new.

01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:32.347
What?

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.449
That interring them
only gave them power.

01:11:36.817 --> 01:11:37.818
Power for what?

01:11:43.258 --> 01:11:45.961
Power to bring
them back from the dead.

01:11:59.508 --> 01:12:00.708
Break's over.

01:12:52.263 --> 01:12:57.502
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

01:13:02.574 --> 01:13:03.976
Get off of me.

01:13:04.009 --> 01:13:06.912
Remember!

01:13:09.381 --> 01:13:11.049
Remember!

01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:12.817
This isn't real! This isn't real!
This isn't real!

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:13.885
This isn't real!

01:13:13.919 --> 01:13:14.987
This isn't real!

01:13:20.493 --> 01:13:21.527
Easy, son.

01:13:22.228 --> 01:13:23.296
Take it easy.

01:13:24.464 --> 01:13:25.831
It's all right.

01:13:26.366 --> 01:13:27.367
Relax.

01:13:32.572 --> 01:13:34.540
Two...

01:13:34.574 --> 01:13:35.774
Hold him down.

01:13:38.578 --> 01:13:39.946
Easy.

01:13:42.315 --> 01:13:43.449
Get away!

01:13:43.483 --> 01:13:45.119
Back off! Back off!

01:13:45.152 --> 01:13:46.587
- Get a grip. You stand down!
- Get away!

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:47.888
Stand down, son!

01:13:47.921 --> 01:13:50.324
Son, before you hurt someone,

01:13:50.357 --> 01:13:51.525
give me that.

01:13:51.558 --> 01:13:52.526
Ann, you pull him out.

01:13:52.559 --> 01:13:54.895
I don't want him going
under like that again.

01:14:08.376 --> 01:14:09.978
Don't worry if you
can't remember anything.

01:14:10.011 --> 01:14:11.046
That'll pass shortly.

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:14.848
Where am I?

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:16.951
You were flown to a special
off-book facility.

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:18.953
You remember your last day
in Afghanistan, Lieutenant?

01:14:22.023 --> 01:14:23.358
Give it a sec.
It'll come to you.

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:32.935
Let's move!

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:44.547
What's the situation?

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.483
The asset's the blue-chip doctor
for Islamic state's top brass.

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.318
- Co-operating?
- Yeah.

01:14:49.352 --> 01:14:51.987
Fed us sight intel on the
last four high-value kills.

01:14:52.021 --> 01:14:54.957
Put his entire family at risk to help
us, but he's been blown.

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.259
Go for sent comm.

01:14:56.293 --> 01:14:57.461
So it's an extraction?

01:14:59.229 --> 01:15:02.065
The plan is to get his family
to a safe house in Kabul,

01:15:02.099 --> 01:15:05.569
but there goes our information pipeline.
Copy that.

01:15:14.411 --> 01:15:16.413
All the injuries to your squad
were extreme.

01:15:20.618 --> 01:15:23.921
You were far too critical
for the Kandahar trauma center.

01:15:23.955 --> 01:15:26.023
The mind is a very powerful
healing tool,

01:15:26.057 --> 01:15:28.259
but when pressed by
the awareness of paralysis

01:15:28.292 --> 01:15:32.029
and amputation, it can
simply shut down and die.

01:15:33.498 --> 01:15:36.634
Our computer simulation
is designed to help soldiers

01:15:36.667 --> 01:15:38.436
recover from their
post-traumatic stress

01:15:38.469 --> 01:15:40.138
as they heal
from their injuries.

01:15:40.571 --> 01:15:41.572
Where's Butchie?

01:15:42.473 --> 01:15:43.608
Why can't I remember?

01:15:43.641 --> 01:15:45.377
I'm sorry.

01:15:45.411 --> 01:15:47.012
It's not supposed
to happen like this.

01:15:47.446 --> 01:15:48.447
Like what?

01:15:59.358 --> 01:16:00.359
Okay.

01:16:02.661 --> 01:16:04.229
Playing cat's cradle, huh?

01:16:06.165 --> 01:16:08.201
You see this?

01:16:08.234 --> 01:16:10.203
I was going to give this
to my boy. You want it?

01:16:10.236 --> 01:16:12.238
Your hands are tied.
You want that?

01:16:12.272 --> 01:16:13.306
There.

01:16:23.583 --> 01:16:24.751
Hey, Paul.

01:16:24.784 --> 01:16:27.253
- <i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>
- <i>Wa-Salaam-Alaikum,</i> Paul.

01:16:27.287 --> 01:16:28.488
Please join us.

01:16:30.356 --> 01:16:31.357
Doctor.

01:16:35.696 --> 01:16:36.831
Is this everyone?

01:16:36.864 --> 01:16:39.600
Yellow-six, stand by with the van.

01:16:39.633 --> 01:16:40.668
What's wrong?

01:16:40.701 --> 01:16:43.137
That day we hoped
would never come?

01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:45.439
Your name keeps coming up
on the cyber chatter.

01:16:45.473 --> 01:16:46.507
What? What happened?

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.409
You promised to protect us!

01:16:48.442 --> 01:16:51.645
I know, and I'm sorry, but look,
you don't even have time to pack.

01:16:51.679 --> 01:16:52.847
Just get your children,

01:16:52.881 --> 01:16:55.449
get your passports and meet
us outside in two minutes.

01:16:55.483 --> 01:16:57.486
- Let's move.
- <i>Echo 11, abort mission.</i>

01:16:57.519 --> 01:16:59.354
- What?
- <i>Got three incoming land bogeys</i>

01:16:59.387 --> 01:17:00.722
<i>cutting off all major arteries.</i>

01:17:00.755 --> 01:17:03.525
<i>You got about
30 seconds to find cover.</i>

01:17:03.558 --> 01:17:05.327
Command jacked
into NATO satellite,

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.195
ISIS forces are coming
in from all sides.

01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:08.330
Three vehicles.

01:17:09.564 --> 01:17:10.665
Put us in the wall.

01:17:10.699 --> 01:17:11.733
What?

01:17:11.766 --> 01:17:12.935
ISIS is coming,

01:17:12.969 --> 01:17:15.303
and they're blocking our escape.
Put us in the wall.

01:17:16.838 --> 01:17:19.274
- Hide.
- Come, please. It is this way.

01:17:19.307 --> 01:17:20.343
Here, here, here.

01:17:20.376 --> 01:17:21.377
Cristina!

01:17:25.381 --> 01:17:26.382
Inside!

01:17:27.183 --> 01:17:28.184
Keep dreaming, man.

01:17:29.118 --> 01:17:31.053
Extraction is now impossible.

01:17:31.087 --> 01:17:34.190
We wait for the hajis and let the
drones track 'em back to the big brass.

01:17:34.223 --> 01:17:37.093
CDE can put eyes,
we're ahead in five.

01:17:37.126 --> 01:17:38.828
- Move!
- Fuck that, I'm not going in there.

01:17:38.861 --> 01:17:41.297
You don't have a goddamn
opinion until I give you one!

01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:42.498
What about
protecting the family?

01:17:42.532 --> 01:17:45.102
Get in the fucking wall! Now!

01:17:46.403 --> 01:17:47.404
Fuck.

01:17:49.406 --> 01:17:51.775
Come on. Come on.
You have to hide.

01:17:52.476 --> 01:17:53.477
Come on.

01:17:54.478 --> 01:17:55.646
Get in! Go!

01:18:35.354 --> 01:18:36.355
Shh.

01:20:54.966 --> 01:20:56.468
You're done.

01:22:32.902 --> 01:22:35.470
Drones are locked.
Nobody move.

01:22:39.775 --> 01:22:41.343
See you at my court-martial.

01:22:57.127 --> 01:22:58.661
We were never here.

01:23:00.864 --> 01:23:03.533
With all respect,
fuck you, sir.

01:23:09.439 --> 01:23:12.642
You got eyes on 'em?
Do not lose them.

01:23:23.754 --> 01:23:25.957
Bomb!

01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:47.846
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:23:47.879 --> 01:23:51.083
We should have helped them. We could
have saved them before it was too late.

01:23:51.117 --> 01:23:52.919
And what about this guys,
they're still in France?

01:23:52.952 --> 01:23:55.087
Why did you guys put us
in a fucking war at all?

01:23:55.121 --> 01:23:57.622
World War II scenario has been
the most effective for linking

01:23:57.656 --> 01:23:59.992
like-minded soldiers
with purpose, with brotherhood.

01:24:00.026 --> 01:24:02.460
something the sim
just can't create by itself.

01:24:02.494 --> 01:24:05.164
For six weeks,
you all were thriving.

01:24:05.197 --> 01:24:09.869
Making miraculous recoveries, despite
your conditions, especially in the mind.

01:24:09.903 --> 01:24:13.873
A few days ago, Butchie Martinsen
woke from an induced coma

01:24:13.907 --> 01:24:15.943
for reasons we don't understand.

01:24:15.976 --> 01:24:20.780
And when he saw his body,
he just simply shut his eyes and he died.

01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:23.016
Which he tried to tell us.

01:24:23.984 --> 01:24:25.118
This isn't real.

01:24:26.752 --> 01:24:28.956
- Phantom itch.
- You have an itch?

01:24:28.989 --> 01:24:30.090
No, in the sim.

01:24:30.123 --> 01:24:32.859
Kirk was always
scratching his feet.

01:24:32.894 --> 01:24:37.531
And the Morse Code we heard,
was a message from... us.

01:24:37.564 --> 01:24:39.133
"I have no legs."

01:24:39.167 --> 01:24:42.602
That was our subconscious mind telling
us what we couldn't see for ourselves.

01:24:42.636 --> 01:24:47.241
And, "you leave, you die." Not a
threat but a warning about the sim.

01:24:47.275 --> 01:24:50.044
You sent subliminal messages
to yourself, that's...

01:24:51.312 --> 01:24:53.680
- That's incredible.
- Yeah, and dangerous.

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:54.983
There's gotta be a way
to shut that down.

01:24:56.018 --> 01:24:57.819
More CTZ to the frontal lobe.

01:25:07.062 --> 01:25:08.529
Your sim is haunted, you know.

01:25:09.797 --> 01:25:11.100
There's a ghost in the machine.

01:25:11.133 --> 01:25:14.136
Or a computer virus,
or a programmer with a fuck ton of issues,

01:25:14.169 --> 01:25:16.604
unless it's supposed to feel
like you're in a horror movie.

01:25:16.637 --> 01:25:19.808
- How so?
- That's not part of the program?

01:25:19.842 --> 01:25:22.644
Sticking in avatars of
previously engaged combatants?

01:25:22.678 --> 01:25:24.747
- Reliving old missions?
- God, no.

01:25:25.982 --> 01:25:27.549
The simulation is meant
to be benign.

01:25:27.583 --> 01:25:31.287
World War II was chosen because it
would trigger fewer real-world memories.

01:25:31.321 --> 01:25:32.755
What about the word
"vetrulek"?

01:25:35.091 --> 01:25:36.192
What?

01:25:36.226 --> 01:25:39.929
You all whispered that word
at one time or another.

01:25:39.963 --> 01:25:43.066
The Internet says
it's a Muslim curse.

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.654
What the hell is that?

01:26:11.063 --> 01:26:12.964
We brought the Helwigs
into the sim with us.

01:26:19.703 --> 01:26:20.972
We brought them to life,
gave them power.

01:26:22.074 --> 01:26:24.176
But the program...
None of it's real.

01:26:24.209 --> 01:26:26.011
It's real when you're
fucking in it!

01:26:26.044 --> 01:26:27.312
The prayers, everything.

01:26:32.385 --> 01:26:36.055
Get an evac team down here
immediately.

01:26:36.089 --> 01:26:38.958
- You gotta put me back in there.
- No, I'm gonna sedate them.

01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:42.128
- 20mls Propofol.
- Put me back in, I can save them.

01:26:42.161 --> 01:26:45.797
We were blind to what we did to them.
They tried to show us but we couldn't see.

01:26:45.831 --> 01:26:50.069
Just look for yourself. Were my memories
in Afghanistan supposed to be there?

01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:53.172
Okay, I'll put you back.

01:26:53.206 --> 01:26:55.641
- But what will you do?
- We need to face what we did.

01:26:55.675 --> 01:26:57.710
Atone for our sins
before it's too late.

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:00.981
Do it.

01:27:02.049 --> 01:27:03.850
Okay.

01:27:03.883 --> 01:27:05.953
<i>Initiating promotion
sequence.</i>

01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:09.022
<i>Simulator engaged.</i>

01:27:10.324 --> 01:27:12.059
<i>Memory suppression complete.</i>

01:27:12.092 --> 01:27:14.228
- Wait, Chris!
- <i>In 10...</i>

01:27:14.261 --> 01:27:16.629
- <i>Your memory will be wiped.</i>
- <i>Nine...</i>

01:27:17.464 --> 01:27:19.066
<i>Eight...</i>

01:27:19.099 --> 01:27:21.202
<i>Seven...</i>

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:23.304
<i>Six...</i>

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:25.106
<i>Five...</i>

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.109

01:27:28.143 --> 01:27:29.643
<i>Three...</i>

01:27:30.844 --> 01:27:32.180
<i>Two...</i>

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:34.781
<i>One.</i>

01:28:02.378 --> 01:28:03.913
What do you want?
