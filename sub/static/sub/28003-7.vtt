07:29.657 --> 07:30.616

is supposed to happen... happens.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.362
[Klaus] Luther!

13:42.571 --> 13:44.740
Luther, you need to tie me up so I can--

13:46.534 --> 13:47.743
Are you drinking?

13:51.455 --> 13:53.541
Holy sh... [laughing]

13:53.624 --> 13:55.251
Holy shit, you're drunk.

13:55.876 --> 14:00.297
And you busted into Dad's liquor cabinet.
He's gonna be so pissed.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.008
Get him.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.054
[sighs] Dad. Do it, now.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.850
I told you already, all right?
I-- I can't!

14:10.933 --> 14:12.726
-[gasps]
-Little shit!

14:13.769 --> 14:15.771
[groans]

14:16.480 --> 14:18.774
[choking] Please... I... [groans]

14:18.858 --> 14:20.985
[coughing]

14:24.154 --> 14:25.447
Jesus Christ.

14:25.948 --> 14:26.824
Luther!

14:27.783 --> 14:29.577
Of course I tried!

14:30.202 --> 14:33.706
All right? God knows, I've tried,
but he is as he was in life,

14:33.789 --> 14:34.999
he's a stubborn prick!

14:35.082 --> 14:37.376
He needs to answer to me for what he did.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.212
For sending me up there.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.799
I sacrificed everything for him,
my entire life.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.593
I never left this house.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.177
I never had friends.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.555
And for what?

14:51.473 --> 14:52.349
For nothing.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.684
Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.352
Hey, just... just...

14:55.436 --> 14:56.520
[sighs]

14:56.604 --> 14:59.189
Just relax, okay? Just-- Just relax.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.774
I-- I could try again.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.861
I mean, I can't promise I'm clean enough.
But just--

15:06.322 --> 15:07.990
Hey, come on. Hey, hey, hey, come on.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.910
That's-- That's enough of that.
Enough of that. Come on.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.621
Come on, come on.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.998
Chin up there, big guy.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.792
It's okay. Just go.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.338
Why-- Why don't we find the others?
I'm sure Allison could help.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.297
I don't want her.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.758
I don't want them to see me like this.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.054
Besides, I--
You know, I'd just hold them back.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.680
What they're doing is too important.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.642
What are you talking about?

15:35.684 --> 15:37.728
You're our Number One, remember?
"O Captain! My Captain!"

15:40.022 --> 15:42.024
[chuckles]

15:42.858 --> 15:44.985
-Remember?
-[both laugh]

15:45.778 --> 15:47.488
Yeah, right?

15:50.449 --> 15:51.700
[sobs]

15:58.499 --> 16:01.502
-Luther.
-[Luther] You know, Diego was right.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.796
Dad sent me up to the Moon...

16:05.255 --> 16:07.466
because he couldn't stand
the sight of this.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.593
[sighs deeply]

16:10.302 --> 16:11.428
Of what...

16:12.262 --> 16:13.555
Of what he did to me.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.641
Of what I've become.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.354
No, no, no. That's... That's not...

16:22.481 --> 16:23.524
It...

16:23.607 --> 16:27.069
Damn it, Dad was such an asshole
right to the end.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.489
[sighs] You know, if...

16:31.323 --> 16:33.951
if there's anything else...

16:35.077 --> 16:36.954
that I can do, or...

16:37.037 --> 16:38.497
I wanna be like you.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.458
-I wanna do whatever it is that you--
-No, no, no no.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.794
-Yeah. I do. Yeah.
-You don't. No. Absolutely not.

16:43.919 --> 16:48.716
Come on, Klaus. 'Cause you... you always
seem so carefree, and I just need it. I...

16:48.841 --> 16:51.927
-I wanna be Number Four.
-Trust me. Trust me.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.513
-You don't want that.
-I do...

16:54.596 --> 16:55.931
You don't want that.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.226
What you need is just...
just lay down, sleep it off.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.353
You'll feel better in the morning. Okay?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.272
Fine, I'll go by myself.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.024
What? No.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.150
No, no, no, Luther!

17:06.817 --> 17:08.485
Luther, I can't let you--

17:08.569 --> 17:10.404
-[yells]
-[squeaks]

17:11.280 --> 17:12.865
-[door opens]
-[groans]

17:12.948 --> 17:14.450
-Oh, shit.
-[door slams]

17:14.783 --> 17:16.785
[motor sputtering]

17:25.794 --> 17:27.546
[Hazel] <i>Would it really be so bad</i>

17:28.547 --> 17:30.174
<i>if we didn't find the briefcase?</i>

17:31.800 --> 17:34.428
[Cha-Cha] <i>You know what happens</i>
<i>to people who step out of line.</i>

17:40.768 --> 17:44.688
[Hazel] <i>I guess I'm just tired of all this</i>
<i>being told what to do, where to go.</i>

17:46.815 --> 17:48.901
<i>Wouldn't it be nice to kill who you want</i>
<i>for a change?</i>

17:48.984 --> 17:50.360
<i>Not who the Commission tells us to?</i>

17:53.113 --> 17:54.823
Sure are in the middle of nowhere.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.793
-What are you doing?
-[gun clicking]

18:05.876 --> 18:07.002
Just tying my shoe.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.255
[Cha-Cha]
Our only choice is to do what they say.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.801
One way or another, they always get you.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.514
You're right. I know you're right.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.519
Doesn't change I feel like we ought
to do somethin' that matters.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.687
[Cha-Cha] What we do matters.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.897
[Hazel] I mean, to us.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.733
Not to some asshole executives
in polyester suits.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.361
You and I've been doin' what they say
so long,

18:33.570 --> 18:35.489
I don't even know what I think anymore.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.032
[bird calling]

18:37.116 --> 18:38.742
[Hazel] You hear that? Listen?

18:40.828 --> 18:43.038
-That's a pileated woodpecker.
-[woodpecker drilling]

18:43.122 --> 18:46.208
Yeah. If there's one, I bet there's two.

18:50.045 --> 18:50.963
They mate for life.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.882
The male will bring his partner food
to show he can provide,

18:53.966 --> 18:55.717
some cedar bug or critter.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.095
It's all part of the mating ritual.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.263
Look at him.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.810
When he's hungry, he eats,
when he's tired, he nests,

19:04.893 --> 19:07.271
when he's horny, he screws,
free to be free.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.940
Pretty sure they got it figured out.

19:11.400 --> 19:15.112
-[Cha-Cha] And what's that?
-A simple life with a partner.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.739
Sometimes what you want's
right in front of you.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.367
By the time you realize it, it's too late.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.303
-Home, sweet home.
-[Cha-Cha] Yep.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.348
[Hazel] Hey, um...

19:44.266 --> 19:45.142
you hungry?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.477
[Cha-Cha] I could eat.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.113
[tires screech]

19:58.197 --> 19:59.072
[horn beeps]

20:00.073 --> 20:01.158
[gasps] Hi!

20:02.075 --> 20:02.910
Hey.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.039
[giggles]

20:13.420 --> 20:16.006
[Allison] Be careful, okay?
We don't know what Peabody's capable of.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.550
[Diego] Yeah, he didn't seem dangerous
when I first saw him.

20:18.634 --> 20:19.801
Looked kinda scrawny.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.638
Yeah, well, so are most serial killers
and mass murderers.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.765
-I mean, look at him.
-Thanks.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.392
[Diego] Good point.
So what's this guy want with Vanya?

20:27.476 --> 20:29.853
I don't know.
How about we ask him after we kill him?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.813
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, look, I'm gonna burst through--

20:34.983 --> 20:37.819
You know what? It would be nice for people
just to stick to--

20:38.695 --> 20:39.696
the plan.

20:40.697 --> 20:41.573
Great.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.037
Ah! [grunts]

20:47.120 --> 20:48.956
[groans]

20:50.082 --> 20:51.041
[inhales sharply]

20:51.541 --> 20:52.876
-Subtle.
-[Diego groans]

20:52.960 --> 20:54.670
You know, the door was unlocked.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.630
Yeah, well, my way works just fine.

20:57.881 --> 20:58.757
Spread out.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.844
Yell if you, uh...
you know, you're in trouble. [sighs]

21:03.345 --> 21:05.264
Ah, inspiring leadership.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.640
One of the greats.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.450
[Allison] Guys, you need to see this.

21:28.745 --> 21:31.290
[Allison] All our faces are burnt off.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.125
[Diego] Well, that's not creepy.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.169
This guy's got some serious issues.

21:36.795 --> 21:37.671
[both] Shit.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.843
-This was never about Vanya.
-[Five gasping]

21:43.927 --> 21:45.345
This was about us.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.472
-[sighs]
-[thumps]

21:47.556 --> 21:49.474
-[Allison] Five. Wh--
-[groaning]

21:50.183 --> 21:51.143
Wh-- Blood.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.688
[sighs]

21:54.771 --> 21:56.148
[Diego] Jesus, Five.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.483
Why didn't you say anything?

21:58.817 --> 22:00.068
You have to keep going.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.821
So... close.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.489
Five.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.533
Five!

22:13.040 --> 22:14.374
Oh. Wow.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.086
This place is so nice.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.089
Whose is it, again?

22:21.173 --> 22:24.092
This is Grandma's place.
Lots of pinched cheeks, right...

22:24.384 --> 22:25.635
-here.
-[both chuckle]

22:33.560 --> 22:34.394
You okay?

22:36.521 --> 22:39.775
You spend your whole life trying to forget
about the crap you went through as a kid.

22:39.858 --> 22:40.692
You know?

22:41.443 --> 22:45.655
And then, the second you step back in,
you feel just as insignificant.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.243
Yeah, I know.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.208
You know, we don't have to stay here.
We can just...

22:56.416 --> 22:58.418
-get a shitty motel or something.
-No.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.712
It's perfect for what we need to do.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.255
Which is what, exactly?

23:02.339 --> 23:04.633
We need to find out
what you're truly capable of.

23:04.716 --> 23:05.717
Oh, my God.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.261
Remember what you said
the day we met? Practice makes perfect.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.931
Yeah, this is a little different
than chord progressions.

23:12.015 --> 23:13.517
I mean, if I do...

23:16.603 --> 23:19.689
Look, I can't even say it.
I can't wrap my head around it. There's--

23:19.773 --> 23:20.649
Vanya.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.860
You've spent your entire life feeling
less than your brothers and sisters,

23:23.944 --> 23:28.031
only to discover you've had this in you
the entire time.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.952
You owe it to yourself
to discover what that really means.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.245
Okay?

23:34.913 --> 23:36.289
Clear your mind.

23:36.790 --> 23:37.624
Focus.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.294
Where better to do that than here?

23:42.754 --> 23:44.381
[birds singing]

23:45.257 --> 23:47.134
[wind chimes clinking]

23:49.010 --> 23:50.679
[wind rustling leaves]

24:00.230 --> 24:01.231
I'm leaving.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.568
I want you to come with me.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.069
Where?

24:06.820 --> 24:08.405
Anywhere. It doesn't matter to me.

24:08.488 --> 24:09.739
[birds singing]

24:09.823 --> 24:12.159
Let's just fly away, like those warblers.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.453
Is everything okay?

24:15.162 --> 24:16.496
Sure, everything's swell.

24:16.788 --> 24:17.747
No, it isn't.

24:18.457 --> 24:22.669
Customer service, 32 years.
You... You learn a thing or two. [sighs]

24:23.545 --> 24:25.046
-It's just work.
-[Agnes] Oh.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.256
It's a new assignment.

24:26.965 --> 24:27.841
Corporate.

24:29.134 --> 24:32.512
We're supposed to follow orders,
no questions asked, but...

24:34.598 --> 24:36.266
-[Agnes] But what?
-I don't want to.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.268
-[Agnes] Oh.
-Not anymore.

24:39.394 --> 24:42.272
I'm done playin' their games.
I'm ready for a change.

24:43.523 --> 24:44.691
I think you are, too.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.320
Okay.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.282
Really?

24:52.824 --> 24:54.159
Yes, really.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.578
I mean, it-- it's like what you said.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.706
"Life is short,
and if you wanna do something,

24:59.789 --> 25:01.583
you just gotta... go for it."

25:03.168 --> 25:04.753
You have no idea, uh...

25:05.754 --> 25:10.383
-how happy that makes me. [crying]
-Sure. Sure, I do.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.093
How did your partner take it?

25:13.136 --> 25:14.262
Oh...

25:15.013 --> 25:16.223
Oh, I haven't told her.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.392
In the years we worked together,
she's never taken a sick day.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.728
Her job's her life.
I wouldn't know where to start.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.523
I mean,
it wouldn't be right to just disappear.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.526
Okay, I'll try.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.445
-You better be packed and ready...
-Okay.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.114
...when I come to get you.
We leave in the middle of the night.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.325
-Two stowaways.
-[laughs] Okay.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.701
Assuming you still wanna do it.

25:36.785 --> 25:37.661
-I understand--
-Hazel.

25:37.744 --> 25:38.662
Yeah?

25:39.454 --> 25:42.415
I've never been more sure of anything
in my life.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.417
Okay.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.852
[Agnes chuckles]

26:03.311 --> 26:05.772
Okay, I just...

26:06.648 --> 26:08.233
-[clears throat]
-Sorry.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.904
[Agnes laughing] Okay.

26:12.988 --> 26:13.822
Bye.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.074
-[gasps] Bye.
-[chuckles]

26:16.950 --> 26:18.326
-[grunts]
-[door closes]

26:37.053 --> 26:39.347
[Ben] You can do this, Klaus.
Luther needs you.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.433
[Klaus sighs]

26:44.936 --> 26:46.104
[groans]

26:46.938 --> 26:47.981
I just...

26:48.857 --> 26:50.150
Oh, I just...

26:51.484 --> 26:54.237
Ugh. This is... this is pointless. I...

26:55.697 --> 26:59.701
Aah, I'm goin' home. I...
I have to go home. I'm so dope sick.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.787
[chuckles]

27:03.455 --> 27:06.750
You know I could just walk through you,
right?

27:06.833 --> 27:07.834
I'm well aware.
[Klaus] Ta-da!

27:09.544 --> 27:11.296
-But you need to keep trying.
-[sighs]

27:11.379 --> 27:12.422
Help Luther.

27:12.505 --> 27:16.217
He could be anywhere right now,
doing God knows what.

27:16.301 --> 27:19.095
You know what?
This is probably a good thing.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.932
The big guy needs a life, and tonight
he's out experiencing the real world!

27:23.016 --> 27:26.394
-He's not ready for it.
-Well, who is? Was I? Were you?

27:27.854 --> 27:29.981
I-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27:30.065 --> 27:33.401
I know you weren't ready
to die violently at a young age.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.489
Oh, sobriety isn't easy.

27:38.531 --> 27:40.825
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

27:40.909 --> 27:45.914
It's not my responsibility. I--
I didn't sign up to save you or him.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.624
You're right. You didn't.

27:48.041 --> 27:51.503
But if you were in trouble,
there is nothing in this world

27:51.586 --> 27:54.381
Luther wouldn't do
to save your scrawny little junkie ass.

27:55.965 --> 27:57.050
[sighs]

27:58.760 --> 28:00.387
[muttering[ Damn it...

28:04.307 --> 28:06.351
We should have taken him to the hospital.

28:06.434 --> 28:09.521
[Diego] A kid with a shrapnel wound
might raise some questions.

28:09.604 --> 28:12.732
Yeah, well, so does the murder shrine
in Harold Jenkins' attic.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.359
[groans]

28:14.442 --> 28:17.570
-He's still losing blood. What do we do?
-We gotta get the shrapnel out.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.580
-Diego, where are you going?
-[Diego] Mom?

28:28.873 --> 28:31.000
Oh, hello, Diego, dear.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.379
What...

28:38.174 --> 28:40.343
How are you still... walking around?

28:41.177 --> 28:42.971
One foot in front of the other.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.640
Why? How do you do it?

28:48.768 --> 28:53.398
[Klaus] We've been to seven bars,
three strip joints, and a laundromat.

28:53.481 --> 28:55.650
Luther's not here. Can we go home now?

28:55.775 --> 28:56.818
Would he give up on you?

28:56.901 --> 28:58.903
-[women laughing]
-[Klaus] Uh...

28:59.612 --> 29:02.907
[woman] That's the biggest hairy guy
I have ever seen.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.993
[women giggling]
[techno music playing]

29:16.629 --> 29:17.839
[Klaus groans]

29:18.506 --> 29:19.966
[groans]

29:27.223 --> 29:28.975
God, this is torture.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.185
I can't hear you!

29:30.268 --> 29:32.312
[sighs]

29:38.234 --> 29:39.652
[Klaus and Ben] Holy shit.

29:44.699 --> 29:45.950
Do you think he knows?

29:46.409 --> 29:48.286
-I don't think he cares.
-Come on.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.956
[man] Whoo-hoo!

29:55.460 --> 29:56.294
Luther!

29:57.170 --> 29:58.671
Luther!

29:58.755 --> 29:59.923
Brother!

30:01.090 --> 30:01.925
[Klaus] Ow!

30:07.889 --> 30:09.140
[grunts]
-[coughs]
-Isn't this amazing?

30:10.558 --> 30:13.144
Yeah. We need to get you home. Come on.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.396
[Luther] Home? This is my home now.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.398
[man] Where are you going? Come back.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.526
[woman] Relax, I just wanna say hi.

30:21.027 --> 30:22.612
Huge fan of the furries.

30:25.615 --> 30:26.991
-See?
-Yeah.

30:27.575 --> 30:28.743
[man] Whoo-hoo!

30:28.827 --> 30:30.119
Have you ever tried one of these?

30:30.662 --> 30:33.206
-Yeah.
-I've never felt so alive.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.208
But I'm so thirsty.

30:35.291 --> 30:36.376
Yeah.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.211
Wha--

30:40.588 --> 30:42.882
-Why'd you do that?
-I have no idea.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.389
[woman] Whoo-hoo!

30:49.472 --> 30:53.643
[Ben] Come on, Klaus. You can do this.
Stay strong. Don't give into temptation.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.353
[music pounding]

30:55.436 --> 30:56.896
[yelling] No!

30:57.689 --> 30:59.691
[distorted cheering]

31:02.902 --> 31:04.654
[rumbling]

31:04.779 --> 31:06.781

-No!

31:07.866 --> 31:09.701
[screaming]

31:10.493 --> 31:11.870

31:13.872 --> 31:15.456
[screeching]

31:16.374 --> 31:17.792
[whimpering]

31:47.697 --> 31:49.699
[echoing footsteps]

31:57.832 --> 31:59.208

32:00.710 --> 32:02.170
[Klaus] <i>We need a medic here!</i>

32:02.921 --> 32:04.923
<i>-Dave!</i>
-[gunfire]

32:05.965 --> 32:07.258
[Dave screaming]

32:10.136 --> 32:11.471

32:18.353 --> 32:19.979
[helicopter blades whirring]

32:34.035 --> 32:35.620
[sobbing]

32:36.871 --> 32:38.873
[insects chirping]

32:46.506 --> 32:47.340
Anything?

32:48.508 --> 32:50.385
There's no answer at Vanya's place.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.596
And the receptionist at her music school

32:53.680 --> 32:55.890
said she was a no-show
for her lessons today.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.395
Hey, you okay?

33:02.647 --> 33:03.481
Yeah.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.487
I don't know,
it's just surreal seeing her.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.658
I just wanna tell her that I'm s...

33:17.620 --> 33:20.748
-We don't have enough time. We gotta go.
-I don't know, Diego.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.002
Five is laying there, unconscious.
We need him.

33:24.419 --> 33:27.463
-We can do this ourselves.
-We did that already, remember?

33:27.547 --> 33:28.715
We all ended up dead.

33:29.632 --> 33:30.925
I don't know. I'm just...

33:31.009 --> 33:32.969
I'm thinking I should go
and see Claire before--

33:33.052 --> 33:34.804
[Diego]
You can't run away from this, Allison.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.807
That's what started this whole mess
in the first place.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.394
-[sighs]
-Luther was right.

33:44.939 --> 33:47.817
[scoffs] I didn't think
I would ever hear you say those words.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.110
Yeah, well...

33:49.861 --> 33:51.070
we gotta stick together.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.325
Where do we start?

33:56.826 --> 34:00.204
There's no other addresses in the file,
but there is another relation listed.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.539
Jenkins' grandmother.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.875
She lived near Jackpine Road.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.128
-You think he took her there?
-It's a good enough place to start.

34:16.971 --> 34:18.973
Nope. Come on, this way.

34:19.057 --> 34:22.060
-Wait, but the car is back that way.
-Trust me, okay? Come on.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.311
But what is going on?

34:24.103 --> 34:26.272
They're here for me. Uh...

34:26.355 --> 34:29.067
-They think I did something.
-What do they think you did?

34:29.150 --> 34:30.735
-[siren whoops]
-Murder.

34:30.818 --> 34:32.862
-Did you?
-No, no, no, of course not, okay?

34:32.945 --> 34:34.530
Why would you ask that about me, anyway?

34:34.614 --> 34:36.449
I mean, you do carry knives
with you everywhere.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.576
Yeah, okay,
we're gonna have to split, okay?

34:38.659 --> 34:40.828
-[sirens wailing]
-I'm in charge.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.414
Remember? Vanya needs you.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.835
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

34:50.046 --> 34:52.048
[tires screech]

34:55.676 --> 34:56.511
[man] Drop it.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.638
Weapon on the ground, Diego.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.099
Ah!

35:01.182 --> 35:02.058
[clattering]

35:02.141 --> 35:03.935
[Diego] I expected better from you, Chuck.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.438
I got orders.
Don't make this harder than it already is.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.440
-[handcuffs click]
-[sighs]

35:10.191 --> 35:12.193
Diego Hargreeves, you're under arrest

35:12.276 --> 35:14.946
on the suspicion
of murder of Detective Eudora Patch.

35:15.029 --> 35:18.032
-Rodriguez, I thought we were friends.
<i>-</i>You killed a cop, asshole.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.618
[Chuck] You have the right
to remain silent. Anything you say

35:20.701 --> 35:22.662
-can and will be used against you.
-[spits]

35:22.745 --> 35:23.955
Use that against me.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.960
[indistinct radio chatter]

35:32.505 --> 35:34.382
[Vanya] Look, I ju--
I don't think I can do this.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.466
[Leonard] I know you can.

35:35.883 --> 35:38.594
Vanya, you've seen what people
with power can do.

35:38.678 --> 35:41.597
They can stand up for those
who can't defend themselves.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.057
Yeah, and at what cost?

35:43.141 --> 35:46.894
I watched everything my brothers
and sister could do ruin their lives.

35:47.019 --> 35:48.855
They're full of holier-than-thou bullshit.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.566
Like you said.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.068
That's what's ruined their lives.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.362
And that's not gonna happen to you.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.698
Okay?

36:00.241 --> 36:01.826
Just try to move the boat.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.037
[frogs croaking]

36:09.000 --> 36:11.210
-[Vanya] Is anything happening?
-[Leonard] Keep trying.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.336
[sighs] But I don't--

36:12.420 --> 36:14.338
Think about how you want the boat to move.

36:14.422 --> 36:19.635
[groans] Okay, but what?
Do I-- Do I... do I stare really hard?

36:19.719 --> 36:23.347
Am I supposed to point my fingers? Is...?

36:23.890 --> 36:26.726
I don't know.
There's only one way to figure it out.

36:28.644 --> 36:30.646
[insects chirping]

36:52.543 --> 36:53.628
[giggles]

36:53.961 --> 36:55.463
[laughing] I ca--

36:55.546 --> 36:57.423
I can't. I can't.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.383
-What's funny?
-What's...?

37:00.301 --> 37:01.844
I look and I feel ridiculous.

37:01.928 --> 37:05.389
I have no idea how they did this stuff
with a straight face. I--

37:05.473 --> 37:07.600
It's because you're not used to it,
that's all.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.810
If you kept trying, maybe you would--

37:14.732 --> 37:16.943
-You are so invested in this.
-[scoffs]

37:17.777 --> 37:18.736
I--

37:19.862 --> 37:21.822
I'm just trying to help you, Vanya.

37:22.281 --> 37:24.033
You can't just give up that easily.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.956
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

37:30.998 --> 37:31.832
Ah.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.086
Maybe you're right.
I think we're both tired.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.212
So...

37:37.004 --> 37:40.049
why don't we go back
and relax a little bit, okay?

37:40.132 --> 37:41.634
Yeah, that sounds nice.

37:41.717 --> 37:42.718
And, uh...

37:43.552 --> 37:45.429
later, maybe we can grab some dinner?

37:46.097 --> 37:48.015
I know this great little spot in town.

37:48.557 --> 37:49.392
Yeah.

38:00.528 --> 38:01.362

Oh. Yoo-hoo!

41:31.155 --> 41:32.031
Hello.

41:35.367 --> 41:36.577
Almost didn't see you.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.412
Keep on riding around here.

41:38.746 --> 41:39.705
So pale and all.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.166
-Hmm.
-They don't have any sun down there?

41:43.792 --> 41:44.877
Down there?

41:45.628 --> 41:47.755
-Where am I?
-Where do you think?

41:49.089 --> 41:52.343
-I'm not sure. I'm agnostic, so--
-Doesn't really matter.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.136
You can't stay here.

41:54.803 --> 41:55.804
Why not?

41:55.888 --> 41:58.098
To be blunt, I don't really like you
all that much.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.183
Mm.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.684
Yeah, me neither.

42:01.310 --> 42:04.813
But wait a minute.
Aren't you supposed to love all of us?

42:04.897 --> 42:07.024
[scoffs] Where'd you get that idea?

42:07.816 --> 42:10.319
I need you so I can pick and choose.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.196
-And you don't rub me the right way.
-Wait.

42:13.030 --> 42:16.158
So you... you made us? You made me?

42:16.325 --> 42:18.661
Well, I made everything else,
so I must've made you.

42:18.744 --> 42:20.204
[laughs]

42:20.913 --> 42:21.830
Why?

42:22.414 --> 42:23.832
Do you have another idea?
Maybe. A couple.

[Reginald] What in God's name
took you so long?

44:06.894 --> 44:07.728
Dad.

44:07.811 --> 44:12.107
I expected my son who can conjure the dead
to have brought me forth days ago.

44:13.859 --> 44:16.111
Oh. Yeah, well, you see...

44:16.904 --> 44:19.406
It's complicated.
You know, I... I tried. I--

-You were poisoning yourself.

Well, what do you expect? You'd just died.
I was beside myself with grief.

44:26.622 --> 44:29.458
Don't you dare try to use me
as an excuse for your weakness.

44:29.541 --> 44:32.628
Oh, right, well, yeah,
you had nothing to do with it.

44:33.128 --> 44:36.799

when I was 13?

44:37.257 --> 44:38.967
No, you're right, it's irrelevant.

Don't worry.
You're already dead.

44:47.184 --> 44:48.227
Oh.

44:49.144 --> 44:50.521
Well, that's a relief.

44:50.604 --> 44:53.524
You children like to blame everything
on me.

44:58.821 --> 45:00.989

45:01.073 --> 45:04.159

45:07.621 --> 45:09.957
You're my greatest disappointment,

You only scratched the surface
of what you were truly capable of.

45:14.628 --> 45:17.506
-If only you'd focused.
-Wait, wait, wait. What... What potential?

45:17.589 --> 45:21.427
No, instead, you pump yourself
full of poison because you're afraid.

You never had our best interests at heart.
Look at your precious Number One.

he'd sent you.

45:35.524 --> 45:39.653

for nothing.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.156
That was foolish of me.

45:43.490 --> 45:45.826

-Not an ideal solution, I confess.

But I knew that the world
would soon need him, need all of you,

46:00.090 --> 46:02.843
