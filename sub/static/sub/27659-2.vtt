WEBVTT

00:05.788 --> 00:06.789
- So,

00:06.832 --> 00:08.791
two keys, huh?

00:08.834 --> 00:10.314
That's a lot of snow.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.533
- And if you can't handle it,

00:11.576 --> 00:13.274
we're happy to find
someone who can.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.319
- Don't worry about me, friend.
I can handle it.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.017
Marissa, baby,

00:17.060 --> 00:18.583
go get our guests
something to drink, would you?

00:18.627 --> 00:20.281
- We don't want a drink.
- What is this, a social call?

00:20.324 --> 00:22.022
- It's not a tea party.
- We look like

00:22.065 --> 00:23.501
five-year-old girls to you?
- Gentlemen, please.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.242
Have some patience.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.027
Two keys.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.724
Pure as a Catholic schoolgirl.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.465
Did you bring the cash?

00:30.508 --> 00:32.336
- Oh, we brought something
much better than cash.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.729
- What is that?
- Our guns!

00:33.772 --> 00:35.252
- NYPD!
You're under arrest!

00:45.132 --> 00:47.351
- Boss man's gone.
Where'd he go?

00:50.572 --> 00:52.574
Thank you kindly,
little lady.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.538
Gio Costa,

01:00.582 --> 01:02.279
you're under arrest.

01:02.323 --> 01:03.672
- You want that drink now,
Hitchcock?

01:03.715 --> 01:05.065
- Don't mind if I do, Scully.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.501
Don't mind if I do.

01:32.831 --> 01:34.311
- What the hell, Diaz?

01:34.355 --> 01:36.183
You trying to make
your heart explode?

01:36.226 --> 01:37.575
- I'm loading up on coffee
because it's a pain in the ass

01:37.619 --> 01:38.794
getting to the kitchen now,

01:38.837 --> 01:39.882
and I don't want
to come back here.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.405
- Is this about the desks?

01:41.449 --> 01:43.755
- Yes, Terry,
it's about the desks.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.583
How long is Commissioner Kelly
going to punish us

01:45.627 --> 01:47.542
because Captain Holt complained
about him to the mayor?

01:47.585 --> 01:49.152
- I don't know, but I hope
it ends soon.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.285
Terry's shoulders weren't built
for tight spaces.

01:51.328 --> 01:52.851
It's bonk city in here!

01:52.895 --> 01:54.244
- I've said "excuse me"
more times this morning

01:54.288 --> 01:56.246
than I have in my entire life.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.595
Twice!

02:00.642 --> 02:02.209
- Jake.
- Rosa.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.431
- Good morning.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.780
- Oh, my.
We are very close together.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.217
- I love it.
Hey,

02:10.260 --> 02:11.218
you know how I've always wanted

02:11.261 --> 02:12.219
to have another child?

02:12.262 --> 02:13.568
Well, it's happening!

02:13.611 --> 02:14.786
- Genevieve is pregnant?

02:14.830 --> 02:16.266
But I thought your "meh-err"

02:16.310 --> 02:17.746
no longer made "whoo-oo."

02:17.789 --> 02:19.791
- Correct.
My testes no longer make sperm.

02:19.835 --> 02:21.445
- I was good with "meh-err"
and "whoo-oo."

02:21.489 --> 02:22.533
- No, we're thinking
of adopting again.

02:22.577 --> 02:23.839
We just got an email

02:23.882 --> 02:25.754
from Nikolaj's
15-year-old brother

02:25.797 --> 02:27.190
in Latvia that he's never met.

02:27.234 --> 02:28.887
Yeah, his name is Dragomir.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.367
- Oh, my God.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.413
That is a 42-year-old
fur trapper.

02:32.456 --> 02:34.154
- What?
You don't see the resemblance?

02:34.197 --> 02:36.591
- Yeah, to Matisyahu.
There's no way he's 15.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.201
- Well, then, how come he wrote
that his greatest fear

02:38.245 --> 02:40.160
is "going through puberty"?

02:40.203 --> 02:41.335
- Probably because
he wants you to think he's 15

02:41.378 --> 02:42.510
so you'll adopt him.

02:42.553 --> 02:43.728
Look, Charles,
I hate to say this,

02:43.772 --> 02:45.295
but I think this guy
is scamming you.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.557
- Come on.
You're just suspicious

02:46.601 --> 02:47.863
of everyone.
- Jake!

02:47.906 --> 02:49.299
Charles!

02:49.343 --> 02:50.953
Captain wants to see you!

02:50.996 --> 02:53.564
I cannot get through
this room anymore,

02:53.608 --> 02:55.175
so I'm yelling everything now.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.568
Nancy, Captain said you can

02:57.612 --> 02:59.614
go to your psychologist
this morning.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.659
You're clear!
Get your head right.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.574
- Gentlemen,
we have a situation.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.576
Scully and Hitchcock just got
a call from Internal Affairs.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.362
They're interested
in a case of theirs from 1986.

03:08.405 --> 03:11.191
If you ask me, this old case
is only coming up now

03:11.234 --> 03:12.583
because the commissioner
is trying

03:12.627 --> 03:14.455
to drum up a scandal
in the Nine-Nine.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.631
- And take out your two
best detectives in the process.

03:16.674 --> 03:17.762
- You're not
my two best detectives.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.329
- Oh, that's such a relief.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.591
I feel so much safer now.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.376
- Good lord.
- Don't interfere

03:22.419 --> 03:23.942
with IA's investigation.
Just find out

03:23.986 --> 03:25.596
what actually happened

03:25.640 --> 03:27.468
in case Kelly is trying
to manipulate the facts.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.860
Can you do that?

03:28.904 --> 03:29.948
- Oh, so you're asking
if we can open a portal

03:29.992 --> 03:31.515
to the wet and wild 1980s

03:31.559 --> 03:32.821
to investigation
the bizarre lives

03:32.864 --> 03:34.388
of these magnificent dodos?

03:34.431 --> 03:36.346
I believe it was
a young Barack Obama

03:36.390 --> 03:38.914
who said "Uh, yes, we can."

03:38.957 --> 03:40.829
- Ooh, sorry.
Sorry.

03:40.872 --> 03:43.223
Sorry.
You want to see me, sarge?

03:43.266 --> 03:44.398
- Yeah.
I know we're all

03:44.441 --> 03:45.877
sort of crammed together
in here,

03:45.921 --> 03:47.531
but we were kind of thinking

03:47.575 --> 03:49.011
that your uniformed officers

03:49.054 --> 03:50.839
are, uh, causing some problems.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.406
- Oh?
Like what?

03:52.449 --> 03:53.885
- How do I put this tactfully?

03:53.929 --> 03:55.539
- Your squad turned the kitchen
into a cesspool,

03:55.583 --> 03:56.801
nastied up the bathroom,
and made the elevator

03:56.845 --> 03:58.281
smell like a hundred butts.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.240
- Okay, thank you
for your tact, Diaz.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.806
- Well, that's unfair.
Your squad is responsible

04:01.850 --> 04:03.939
for at least 50 of those butts.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.419
- Look, all I'm saying is maybe

04:05.462 --> 04:06.550
you can ask
the downstairs people

04:06.594 --> 04:07.551
to be more--
- Excuse me?

04:07.595 --> 04:09.249
"Downstairs people"?

04:09.292 --> 04:10.989
That's a little offensive.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.253
- Oh, don't get it twisted.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.732
It's just where you came from.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.604
Some of my best friends
are downstairs people.

04:16.647 --> 04:20.347
- Okay, I think you know
exactly what that sounds like,

04:20.390 --> 04:22.479
you upstairs people.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.002
- Oh, thank you
for that nice compliment.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.526
- It wasn't a compliment,
and you know it!

04:25.569 --> 04:26.701
I said it with 'tude.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.485
- Classic downstairs person.

04:28.529 --> 04:31.923
- Wow, you are prejudiced
against the first floor.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.361
I'm taking this up the chain.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.580
- Gina Linetti
spaghetti confetti.

04:36.624 --> 04:38.582
- Gina Linetti
spaghetti confetti.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.410
- Faster.
- GinaLinettispaghetticonfetti.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.759
- Captain Holt.
- Uh, yeah, can't you see

04:41.803 --> 04:42.891
we're in the middle
of something?

04:42.934 --> 04:44.414
- Sorry.
It sounded like you were

04:44.458 --> 04:46.373
just saying gibberish
back and forth.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.765
- Gina is helping me to prepare
for a televised interview.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.332
Since the mayor has yet

04:49.376 --> 04:50.638
to weigh in
on Commissioner Kelly's

04:50.681 --> 04:52.335
"Vigilant Policing" initiative,

04:52.379 --> 04:53.423
I've decided to take
my objections

04:53.467 --> 04:54.772
straight to the people.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.340
- And this gibberish
is actually Gina jargon,

04:57.384 --> 04:59.037
a world-renowned
linguistic system

04:59.081 --> 05:00.996
that worked pretty well
for Ellen Musk.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.954
- Elon Musk.
- Ellen Musk.

05:02.998 --> 05:06.044
- Season one winner
of VH1's "Queen Bitch."

05:06.088 --> 05:07.655
- Sir, isn't going to the press

05:07.698 --> 05:09.309
going to make Kelly
even angrier at us?

05:09.352 --> 05:10.875
- Yeah.
He's already made life here

05:10.919 --> 05:13.487
pretty miserable.
The crowding, the desks,

05:13.530 --> 05:15.793
the downstairs people
treating the bullpen

05:15.837 --> 05:17.404
like a dumpster.

05:17.447 --> 05:20.537
- Ooh, I'm so sorry
for the untidiness, milord.

05:20.581 --> 05:21.625
- That's enough.
I don't have time

05:21.669 --> 05:22.887
for your internecine battles,

05:22.931 --> 05:24.019
and I don't give a hoot

05:24.062 --> 05:25.673
about your
minor inconveniences.

05:25.716 --> 05:27.631
I am trying to fight injustice

05:27.675 --> 05:30.852
and do what is right
for the entire NYPD.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.419
Understood?

05:32.462 --> 05:35.378
- Yes, milord.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.641
- Okay, let's set the scene.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.077
The year is 1986.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.818
"Top Gun" is crushing
the box office,

05:40.862 --> 05:42.516
and the Beastie Boys
have just been issued

05:42.559 --> 05:44.561
their "License to Ill."
- And that's the year

05:44.605 --> 05:45.997
I got felt up
for the first time

05:46.041 --> 05:48.043
under the shirt.
- Always a big moment

05:48.086 --> 05:49.392
in a young boy's life.
All right, tell us

05:49.436 --> 05:50.567
about the case.

05:50.611 --> 05:51.829
- We were working
organized crime,

05:51.873 --> 05:53.831
and we took down
a mafia boss, Gio Costa,

05:53.875 --> 05:55.398
for running cocaine.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.834
- We were the studs
of the Nine-Nine.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.836
- Well, I'm sure "studs"
is a bit of a--

05:58.880 --> 05:59.924
Oh, my God.
I can't believe

05:59.968 --> 06:01.099
I'ma say this, but--

06:01.143 --> 06:02.971
- Meow.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.016
- No, that is not
what I was gonna say,

06:05.060 --> 06:06.844
but honestly, yeah, meow.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.020
No offense, guys, but what
the hell happened to you?

06:09.064 --> 06:10.413
- Are you body shaming us?

06:10.457 --> 06:12.023
- No, I'm personality-shaming
you.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.417
You were so alert and cool
and job-doing.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.853
- So how did you get to Costa?

06:15.897 --> 06:17.115
- We had a CI on the inside

06:17.159 --> 06:18.116
who helped set up a sting.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.596
We took down Costa,

06:19.640 --> 06:20.945
recovered a ton of coke

06:20.989 --> 06:22.643
and three duffel bags
full of cash.

06:22.686 --> 06:23.948
- Seems pretty clear-cut,

06:23.992 --> 06:25.515
but then why would IA
reopen the case?

06:25.559 --> 06:27.082
Unless... they think
it's some sort

06:27.125 --> 06:29.040
of "Freaky Friday" situation
and you guys traded places

06:29.084 --> 06:30.694
with horny singles
in your area.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.522
- It's possible.
- So what happened to the CI?

06:32.566 --> 06:34.132
- Who knows?
It was so long ago.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.439
I mean, I barely remember
how I got to work this morning.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.745
I think there was
an ambulance involved.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.007
- Oh, there was.
- Oh.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.487
- Wait a minute.
Here's a question.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.749
You said you recovered

06:41.792 --> 06:43.446
three duffel bags
full of cash,

06:43.490 --> 06:44.578
and that's what
the evidence logs say as well.

06:44.621 --> 06:45.579
- Yeah.
- So?

06:45.622 --> 06:47.450
- So count the bags.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.191
One, two, three, like you said,

06:49.234 --> 06:50.975
but then take a look
in this mirror behind you,

06:51.019 --> 06:53.064
the one that shows off
your shockingly taut bottoms.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.718
A fourth bag.

06:54.762 --> 06:55.980
- Oh, probably missed it.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.721
- Yeah, you know us.
We're dumb-dumbs.

06:57.765 --> 07:00.071
- But even you wouldn't miss
a giant bag full of cash.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.943
- It was the '80s.
- Police weren't perfect then

07:01.986 --> 07:03.814
like they are today.
- All right, calm down.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.468
We're not accusing you
of anything, right, Jake?

07:05.512 --> 07:07.078
- Kinda was.
- This is crazy!

07:07.122 --> 07:08.906
We're innocent!
- IA is railroading us

07:08.950 --> 07:11.518
like Holt said, and you're
joining in the witch hunt!

07:11.561 --> 07:12.910
- You're fake news!

07:12.954 --> 07:14.434
Sad!

07:16.174 --> 07:19.047
- Yeah, that's definitely
the language of the innocent.

07:21.658 --> 07:24.008
- Okay, so there are
two questions on the table.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.227
First, who was more bang-able,

07:25.270 --> 07:26.533
young Hitchcock
or young Scully?

07:26.576 --> 07:28.012
- Young Hitchcock.
Total smoke show.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.405
- Agreed, but it's close,
and second,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.320
did they steal a big old bag
full of mob cash?

07:31.363 --> 07:32.582
- They said they didn't do

07:32.626 --> 07:33.975
anything wrong.
I believe them.

07:34.018 --> 07:34.976
- When I brought up
the fourth bag,

07:35.019 --> 07:36.107
they stormed out.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.587
- Or, once again, I think

07:37.631 --> 07:39.197
you just can't help
being suspicious

07:39.241 --> 07:40.677
of everyone.
- Oh, my God.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.287
Is that what this is about?
You're mad because I said

07:42.331 --> 07:43.637
the old sea captain
you want to adopt

07:43.680 --> 07:45.290
is scamming you?

07:45.334 --> 07:47.075
- Dragomir is not a captain.
He clubs the fish

07:47.118 --> 07:48.990
in the bottom of the boat.
That's his after-school job.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.208
- Okay, Charles, you are
letting your emotions

07:50.252 --> 07:51.383
cloud your judgment
with Dragomir

07:51.427 --> 07:52.689
and with these guys.

07:52.733 --> 07:54.212
I mean, for all we know,
Hitchcock and Scully

07:54.256 --> 07:55.300
have been playing us for years

07:55.344 --> 07:56.432
like criminal masterminds.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.740
Okay, so maybe not masterminds,

07:59.783 --> 08:01.742
but I'm still going in there
and getting the truth.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.308
All right, guys, let's not
make this

08:03.352 --> 08:04.614
any more difficult
than it has to be.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.137
We know there was
a fourth bag of money.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.617
Where'd it go?
- We told you dorks.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.706
We never saw it.
Now leave us alone.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.316
- I don't think you get
what's happening here.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.492
This is an interrogation,

08:12.535 --> 08:14.145
and it's only gonna end
one way:

08:14.189 --> 08:15.625
with you telling us everything.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.497
- Something funny?

08:17.540 --> 08:19.542
- It's just I don't think
you get what's happening here.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.631
You're locked
in a small, windowless room

08:21.675 --> 08:23.328
with the two of us
one hour after lunch.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.329
- Oh no.
- You want to know

08:24.373 --> 08:25.461
what we ate?

08:25.505 --> 08:26.723
Four-cheese pizza,
double-cheese,

08:26.767 --> 08:29.160
with a side
of cheesy fries, extra cheese,

08:29.204 --> 08:30.553
and a big old slice
of cheesecake.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.642
- But, Scully,

08:32.686 --> 08:34.470
you're lactose intolerant.
- Yeah.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.648
This whole room
is a  Dutch oven.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.345
- What the hell is this?

08:40.389 --> 08:41.738
- The downstairs people

08:41.782 --> 08:43.740
keep making a mess
of the microwave.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.350
One of them thought it was cool

08:45.394 --> 08:47.570
to heat up soup
in an uncovered dish.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.485
That's just crazy!
- How do you know

08:49.529 --> 08:50.660
that's our splatter?
There are some

08:50.704 --> 08:52.401
sloppy Susans upstairs.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.142
- I saw it go down.
It was one of you,

08:54.185 --> 08:55.622
so ya banned.
- No way.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.102
This microwave belongs
to the entire precinct,

08:58.146 --> 09:00.148
so I'm nah-banned.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.324
- Actually, turns out,
this microwave

09:02.367 --> 09:03.673
is not precinct property.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.545
Detective O'Shea
brought it from home

09:05.588 --> 09:07.590
back in '98, so...
- Ya banned.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.374
- I went
to visit O'Shea's widow.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.506
- He's dead?
- Big-time.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.725
She is not over it.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.292
Anyway, I got her
to sign a contract

09:14.336 --> 09:16.599
that states the upstairs
has exclusive

09:16.643 --> 09:18.166
microwave rights.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.646
- You bothered a widow
with this?

09:19.689 --> 09:21.473
- Honestly, it wasn't
that awkward for me.

09:21.517 --> 09:22.605
Rosa did it.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.259
- It was rough,
but she signed it,

09:24.302 --> 09:25.695
so ya banned.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.741
- Okay, now that we
can all breathe,

09:27.784 --> 09:29.481
let's try this again,
unless you want to try

09:29.525 --> 09:30.744
and stink up the entire city
of New York.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.572
- Challenge accepted.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.138
- Okay, everyone, be cool!
Be cool!

09:34.182 --> 09:35.357
Just tell me
everything that happened

09:35.400 --> 09:36.401
after the bust.

09:36.445 --> 09:37.446
- I'll tell you what happened.

09:37.489 --> 09:38.839
We were frigging heroes.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.710
Anybody have a trash can?

09:40.754 --> 09:43.365
'Cause Flat Top and the Freak
are bringing in some garbage.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.108
- You guys had
badass entrance lines

09:47.151 --> 09:48.413
and people cheered?

09:48.457 --> 09:50.285
What happened?
Where'd it all go wrong?

09:50.328 --> 09:51.721
- Some things aren't for us
to know.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.115
- Look, guys,
we never had that money.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.638
Here.
We'll prove it to you.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.379
- Those are
our financial records.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.599
- I don't have any retirement.
I don't have any security,

09:59.642 --> 10:00.643
or a car.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.253
I rent most of my clothes.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.254
- We get it.
You're poor.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.256
- I'm not just poor, son.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.649
I'm destitute.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.390
- Definitely not
a wink-able line.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.870
Ugh, look at all
these credit card charges

10:09.913 --> 10:11.567
for Wing Slutz.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.742
It can't be healthy
to eat there this much.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.396
- If you want a diet option,

10:14.439 --> 10:16.267
the Marine Park location
has a blue cheese parfait.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.269
- You guys go all the way
down to Marine Park for wings?

10:18.313 --> 10:19.531
- There's a waitress there
who always gives us

10:19.575 --> 10:20.750
an extra drumstick

10:20.794 --> 10:22.447
in our slut bucket.
- Wait a minute.

10:22.491 --> 10:23.884
Why do you pay
for a monthly parking spot?

10:23.927 --> 10:25.537
- Because it's New York.
It's hard to park.

10:25.581 --> 10:26.887
- Yeah, but he just said
he doesn't have a car.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.366
So what's parked in this spot

10:28.410 --> 10:29.759
you don't want us
to know about?

10:29.803 --> 10:32.675
Could it be
a super-expensive sports car,

10:32.719 --> 10:34.242
paid for in cash?

10:34.285 --> 10:35.460
Nope.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.245
It's just a sketchy old
sex van.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.682
- There is nothing sketchy
about the Beaver Trap.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.684
- Yes, there is.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.294
- In short,
Commissioner Kelly's

10:43.338 --> 10:44.600
new initiative

10:44.644 --> 10:46.646
is a regressive,
wrongheaded return

10:46.689 --> 10:50.301
to the NYPD's darkest days.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.302
How was that?

10:51.346 --> 10:52.826
- Like watching a corpse

10:52.869 --> 10:55.567
wash up on shore, lifeless.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.265
Come on,
you gotta pace it up, okay?

10:57.308 --> 10:58.483
You need to smile more.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.790
Energize the eyes!
Gesticulate!

11:00.834 --> 11:02.662
- You're describing
the behavior of a crazy person.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.533
- Am I?
Because right now,

11:04.576 --> 11:06.491
you can't take your eyes
off me.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.797
- Oh, that must be

11:07.841 --> 11:09.364
the camera crew,
here to set up the remote.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.670
- Oh, but you're not ready.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.323
This is gonna be
like "The King's Speech,"

11:12.367 --> 11:13.803
before he lost all that weight
or whatever.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.544
I haven't seen that movie.
- Oh, it's fine, Gina.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.807
I don't need any tricks.
I've got the truth,

11:17.851 --> 11:19.374
and the truth is all I need

11:19.417 --> 11:20.723
to bring down--

11:20.767 --> 11:22.594
Commissioner Kelly!

11:22.638 --> 11:24.422
Hello.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.381
- So, Hitchcock, what's the
deal with the secret van?

11:26.424 --> 11:27.774
- Oh, nothing.
It's where I sleep

11:27.817 --> 11:28.818
during my divorces.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.211
If this van's a-rocking,

11:30.254 --> 11:31.647
my ex-wife's a-locking--

11:31.691 --> 11:32.822
me, out of her house.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.258
- Catchy.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.695
What are we doing here, Jake?

11:35.738 --> 11:37.218
What are we even looking for?
- Whatever it is

11:37.261 --> 11:38.915
that Hitchcock's trying
to hide from us.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.352
- I'd imagine he'd be hiding
everything in here from us.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.441
It's a van of horrors.
- Yeah, I know.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.748
I saw the bucket
of male body butter,

11:45.792 --> 11:47.707
and her.
But my gut tells me

11:47.750 --> 11:49.230
there's a smoking gun in here.

11:49.273 --> 11:50.535
- It's like you want them
to be guilty.

11:50.579 --> 11:51.711
- I don't.
I just want

11:51.754 --> 11:52.886
to know what happened,
unlike you,

11:52.929 --> 11:54.191
who doesn't
want them to be guilty,

11:54.235 --> 11:55.715
no matter what the truth is.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.368
- I'm not an idiot
just because I have a heart.

11:57.412 --> 11:58.500
- Well, your heart
just might be an idiot,

11:58.543 --> 12:00.415
because voilà!

12:00.458 --> 12:01.764
So many smells.
Shouldn't have gone

12:01.808 --> 12:03.244
for the flourish.
- Wait, is that--

12:03.287 --> 12:04.724
- The fourth bag
from the picture.

12:04.767 --> 12:08.553
Same logo, same stain
under the handle, and...

12:08.597 --> 12:10.207
It's empty.
They're guilty!

12:10.251 --> 12:11.556
- Nuh-uh.
Not necessarily.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.775
I mean, there could be
a very good--

12:14.646 --> 12:16.474
- Damn it.
We're trapped!

12:16.518 --> 12:17.780
We're trapped
in the Beaver Trap!

12:17.824 --> 12:19.303
We're the beavers!

12:19.347 --> 12:20.391
We're the beavers!

12:24.482 --> 12:25.962
It won't budge.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.094
I can't believe we let
Hitchcock and Scully

12:27.137 --> 12:28.095
get the drop on us.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.096
It's like being outsmarted

12:29.139 --> 12:30.097
by a couple of tomatoes.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.185
- I'm the tomato.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.447
I was wrong about them,

12:32.490 --> 12:33.927
and I'm probably wrong
about Dragomir.

12:33.970 --> 12:34.928
I'm too nice.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.538
I let every random jerk

12:36.581 --> 12:38.453
suckle at the teat
of my human kindness.

12:38.496 --> 12:39.584
- Gross.
Now please

12:39.628 --> 12:41.195
hand me that mannequin's leg.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.936
- There were so many
warning signs about Dragomir.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.241
Nikolaj had never heard
of him...

12:44.285 --> 12:45.460
- He's 45.
- He asked for money.

12:45.503 --> 12:46.853
- He's 45.
- He didn't have

12:46.896 --> 12:48.202
a birth certificate.
- He's 45.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.464
- He looked older than 15.
- He's 45.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.031
- Fine.
He was 45.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.163
I'm just a sucker,
trapped in a creepy sex van.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.469
- Don't say that.
It's not true.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.384
You're no longer trapped
in a van.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.346
Oh, crap.
They took our car.

13:02.390 --> 13:03.608
All right, I'll just call them

13:03.652 --> 13:05.132
and beg them
to turn themselves in.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.134
Oh, no.
I left my phone in the car.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.831
I know it's under
one of their butts.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.006
- Ooh, if they have your phone,

13:10.050 --> 13:11.399
we can track
where they're going.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.967
I have "Find My Phone"
set up to track you.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.142
What?
I do that for all my friends,

13:15.185 --> 13:16.491
not just you.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.622
- Show me.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.407
- There's no time!
Look,

13:19.450 --> 13:21.235
they're headed south
on the Belt Parkway.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.236
- Ooh, check what exit
they're taking.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.585
- Marine Park.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.500
both: They're going
to Wing Slutz!

13:25.543 --> 13:27.067
- But how do we get there?
We don't have a car.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.633
- But we do have a van.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.550
- Yeah, we should have taken
a Lyft.

13:32.594 --> 13:33.595
- I feel like a predator.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.031
This isn't our car!

13:35.075 --> 13:36.206
- It's a loaner.
- We respect women!

13:36.250 --> 13:37.425
- I'm still with her!

13:37.468 --> 13:39.427
- So you are doing
a TV interview?

13:39.470 --> 13:41.429
That's cool.
- Why are you smiling?

13:41.472 --> 13:43.083
- 'Cause he's one
of those friendly villains,

13:43.126 --> 13:45.128
like the Verizon guy
who defected to Sprint.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.434
- If you're angry,
come out and say it.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.262
- I'm not angry.
I'm just curious

13:48.305 --> 13:49.567
about what all this means.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.004
It's not often
that one of our captains

13:51.047 --> 13:53.006
makes an unapproved
media appearance.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.616
It's fun.
- I plan on using

13:54.659 --> 13:56.574
this interview to criticize you
and your policies.

13:56.618 --> 13:59.142
-  Okay.
That's your prerogative.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.448
- No, don't chuckle.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.276
A frown is
a more appropriate response.

14:02.319 --> 14:03.886
- I like you, Raymond.
- No, you don't.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.409
- I do!
And I just came down here

14:05.453 --> 14:07.542
to tell you that if you
go through with this interview,

14:07.585 --> 14:09.370
I have some real fun ideas

14:09.413 --> 14:11.894
about ways to spice up life
at the Nine-Nine.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.548
- I don't like your threats,
and I don't like

14:13.591 --> 14:15.463
the cheery manner in which
you've chosen to deliver them.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.378
- Well, I'm just a cheery guy.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.554
- You're a snake.
- Okay.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.164
I'm a snake.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.388
- Oh, no, they found us!

14:27.431 --> 14:28.998
- Damn straight, we did.
What were you thinking?

14:29.042 --> 14:31.218
- They obviously
weren't thinking about anyone,

14:31.261 --> 14:32.959
especially the one friend--me--

14:33.002 --> 14:34.482
who had their backs
and believed in them

14:34.525 --> 14:35.918
the whole time!

14:35.962 --> 14:37.180
- Why is the little one
so mad?

14:37.224 --> 14:38.355
- He's going
through something.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.009
Now stand up,
wet wipe your hands,

14:40.053 --> 14:41.445
and put them behind your backs
so we can cuff you.

14:41.489 --> 14:42.707
- Oh, thank God.
I'm so tired of running.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.405
- It's only been an hour.
- Stop.

14:44.448 --> 14:45.972
They didn't do
anything wrong.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.277
- Excuse me, ma'am.
This is police business.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.018
- I know.
I'm Donna, the manager here,

14:49.062 --> 14:50.585
but my real name's
Marissa Costa.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.326
I'm Gio Costa's wife,

14:52.369 --> 14:53.675
and I'm the reason
they're here.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.590
- You were the informant.
- Yeah, I was.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.374
- Marissa's the only reason
we got Costa.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.985
- And our captain
screwed her over.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.421
He wouldn't put her
in Witness Protection.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.944
- So you did take the cash.
You just

15:01.988 --> 15:03.554
didn't keep it.
You gave it to her.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.252
- We come down here
and check on her periodically.

15:05.295 --> 15:06.731
- Yeah, we never spoke,
but if she put an extra wing

15:06.775 --> 15:08.255
in our slut bucket,
it meant everything was okay.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.517
- Wait, so I was right.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.084
Hitchcock and Scully
are good people.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.433
- You bet your nips we are,
skid mark.

15:12.476 --> 15:13.956
- Well,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.003
people are complicated.
These two contain...

15:17.046 --> 15:18.439
multitudes.
- Yeah.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.570
- Hey, guys.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.355
I just wanted to say

15:21.398 --> 15:22.617
that I talked to my squad,

15:22.660 --> 15:23.661
and we're sorry

15:23.705 --> 15:25.141
we've been so disrespectful

15:25.185 --> 15:26.447
of your space.
- Really?

15:26.490 --> 15:27.752
What's going on here?
- Nothing.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.276
We just want
to make things right.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.408
You upstairs people
are really great,

15:31.452 --> 15:33.280
and there's a lot
we can learn from you.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.717
- Well, that is true.
We are pretty great,

15:35.760 --> 15:37.762
and you downstairs people
are gonna figure it out.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.460
You're all right.
- Thanks, Terry.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.331
Truce?
- Truce.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.637
- Now!

15:42.680 --> 15:44.291
- What the hell?

15:44.334 --> 15:46.162
- You thought the microwave
was a mess before?

15:46.206 --> 15:48.425
Well, we just threw
a whole fish in there.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.210
- What happened to the truce?

15:50.253 --> 15:52.168
- The truce was crap.
- You bet it was.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.648
Viva the downstairs people!

15:55.563 --> 15:57.478
- What the hell
was in that fish?

15:57.521 --> 15:59.045
- I don't know.
It's from the Gowanus.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.743
It probably ate
a bunch of batteries.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.311
- Diaz, what is going on?

16:04.354 --> 16:06.226
Commissioner Kelly
is still in my office.

16:06.269 --> 16:07.662
- I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

16:07.705 --> 16:09.316
We were just having
a minor disagreement.

16:09.359 --> 16:10.665
- Well, can it!

16:10.708 --> 16:12.580
I am struggling
for the very soul

16:12.623 --> 16:14.060
of the NYPD,

16:14.103 --> 16:15.670
so please stop squabbling

16:15.713 --> 16:17.106
over these unimportant things.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.325
- Of course, sir,

16:18.368 --> 16:19.326
but it's not unimportant.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.284
The overcrowding, the desks--

16:21.328 --> 16:22.503
it's affecting morale.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.244
- Jeez, something smells funky.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.506
What happened here?

16:25.549 --> 16:27.073
Uh-oh.
Was it a fight,

16:27.116 --> 16:28.596
because it's so crowded?

16:28.639 --> 16:30.032
I hope nothing else happens

16:30.076 --> 16:31.512
to make everything worse.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.035
- Listen, Kelly,
I'm going to do that interview,

16:33.079 --> 16:34.558
and you can't stop me,
so go ahead.

16:34.602 --> 16:37.213
Cut our budget,
close more of the building,

16:37.257 --> 16:39.824
open other
fake IA investigations

16:39.868 --> 16:41.696
into my detectives.
- I didn't do that.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.698
No, the IA thing--
your detectives

16:43.741 --> 16:44.786
aren't under investigation,

16:44.829 --> 16:46.527
although it's not a bad idea.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.182
Hey, thanks for the suggestion.

16:49.225 --> 16:51.097
- Excuse me.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.142
I need to make a call.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.535
- Okay, thank you, sir.
Hey, guys,

16:54.578 --> 16:56.232
I have something
super important to tell you,

16:56.276 --> 16:57.538
but first, Scully, you have
a Hitler sauce moustache.

16:57.581 --> 16:58.800
- Thank you.
Go on.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.062
- Internal Affairs
isn't actually

17:00.106 --> 17:01.107
investigating your case.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.369
That call you got wasn't real.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.284
- What?
The guy on the phone

17:04.327 --> 17:05.372
sounded legit.
He had a very deep voice.

17:05.415 --> 17:06.721
- If it's not IA, who is it?

17:06.764 --> 17:07.722
- My guess is someone
who wanted us

17:07.765 --> 17:08.766
to lead them to Marissa.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.075
Which, apparently,
we just did.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.777
- That's Gio Costa.
How'd he get out of jail?

17:19.821 --> 17:21.388
- Probably for good behavior.
He had really great manners.

17:21.431 --> 17:22.998
- Yeah, he and his gigantic gun
look like real sweethearts.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.391
- Noice.
- All right,

17:24.434 --> 17:25.783
we gotta get out of here.
Is there a back exit?

17:25.827 --> 17:26.915
- Through the kitchen.
- Great.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.090
All right,
listen up, everybody.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.265
We're NYPD.
If you could all please

17:29.309 --> 17:30.832
head to the back exit
immediately.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.051
Leave the wings, Hitchcock.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.400
- No!

17:35.228 --> 17:38.100
- Look, Jake,
it's the slut sauce!

17:38.144 --> 17:39.623
- It's perfect!
- Hey, guys,

17:39.667 --> 17:41.190
we gotta leave,
and we gotta leave right now.

17:41.234 --> 17:42.931
Charles, let's go.
- Negative.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.411
I count three,
possibly four gunmen out there.

17:44.454 --> 17:45.977
- All right, no one panic.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.327
I'm sure they didn't even
see us come in here.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.068
- We saw you go back there.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.634
- Okay, so I was wrong
about that.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.114
- I'm gonna go around back
and cut them off.

17:52.158 --> 17:56.075
Knock this door down, now.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.293
-  All right,
here's the way I see it.

17:57.337 --> 17:58.642
We gotta break out
the back entrance

17:58.686 --> 17:59.991
and get these people
to the van.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.167
Okay, everyone,
just follow my lead.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.820
- No, we got you
into this mess.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.257
We'll get you out of it.
Follow our lead.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.736
- There are armed men
out there.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.129
We don't even have
our bulletproof vests.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.348
- We can use the slut sauce.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.132
- That's insane.
It's not even solid.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.438
The bullets will go
right through it.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.266
- If you don't think
the slut sauce is solid,

18:13.309 --> 18:15.442
then you might want to talk
to my rock-hard arteries.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.313
- We're doing this,
and that's final.

18:17.357 --> 18:20.925
Scully, it's time to sauce up.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.670
- Why'd you stop yelling?
- Look.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.152
- Oh, thank god.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.806
My wife and my dad are here.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.112
I mean, Captain Dad.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.374
I mean, I know who my dad is.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.940
It's you.
Hi, Amy.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.203
- SWAT just cleared out
the dining room.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.987
They got everyone.
- Copy that.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.249
All right, Charles, you can
bring everyone out.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.033
The Nine-Nine is here.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.340
See, everyone, I told you
we had it all under control.

18:44.384 --> 18:45.689
There was no need to panic.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.082
- You're dead, Marissa.

18:49.215 --> 18:53.044
- No!

18:56.091 --> 18:57.440
Are you guys okay?
Did you get hit?

18:57.484 --> 18:59.225
- No.
It hit the tub,

18:59.268 --> 19:00.356
but the bullet
didn't make it through.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.488
- The slut sauce--

19:01.531 --> 19:02.793
it saved you.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.012
- You bet your nips it did,

19:04.055 --> 19:05.100
skid mark.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.710
- Oh, Hitchcock.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.451
You suck, man.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.758
- So I spoke
to Internal Affairs,

19:10.801 --> 19:13.500
and since Hitchcock and Scully
did steal that money,

19:13.543 --> 19:14.805
even though it was
to help someone,

19:14.849 --> 19:16.198
there have to be consequences.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.939
both: Desk duty, desk duty,
desk duty...

19:17.982 --> 19:19.070
- One year of desk duty.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.115
both: Yeah!

19:20.159 --> 19:22.204
- Oh, I mean, oh, no.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.075
- Thanks for getting there
so fast today, sir.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.381
Were you able
to still do your interview?

19:25.425 --> 19:27.992
- He did not.
However, I did so.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.429
The real question is

19:29.472 --> 19:31.170
what are police?

19:31.213 --> 19:32.997
- I'm sorry.
Who are you again?

19:33.041 --> 19:35.174
- They said they've never had
more viewer complaints.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.479
Controversial and loving it.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.135
- Oh.
- Squad, I want to apologize.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.442
I have been acting
as though nothing mattered

19:42.485 --> 19:44.008
except my pursuit of justice,

19:44.052 --> 19:45.401
but seeing my people
in danger today

19:45.445 --> 19:47.490
made me realize
I was being short-sighted.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.318
I do give a hoot.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.102
I give a hoot
about all of you.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.234
- Are we gonna keep saying
"hoots"? Is this forever?

19:52.278 --> 19:53.453
- I pray not.
- I'm gonna keep

19:53.496 --> 19:54.976
pushing back
against John Kelly,

19:55.019 --> 19:56.978
but not at your expense.
- Thank you, sir,

19:57.021 --> 19:58.284
and we're going to stop

19:58.327 --> 19:59.937
bickering
with the upstairs people.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.026
- No, Amy.
We're all upstairs people now.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.246
- Thanks, Terry.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.334
- Mmkay.
I clearly missed

20:05.378 --> 20:07.162
a whole thing there.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.424
Hey, man.
I just want to say

20:08.468 --> 20:10.078
I'm sorry I didn't listen
to you.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.558
I was wrong
about Hitchcock and Scully.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.951
- No, you were right.
I am too trusting sometimes.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.866
I did a little digging
on Dragomir.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.173
Turns out, he's not 15.
He's...

20:18.217 --> 20:19.435
- 103.
- 34.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.002
But the orphanage confirmed

20:21.045 --> 20:23.047
he is actually
Nikolaj's half-brother.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.484
Anyway, we're taking it slow.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.050
In a few months,
he'll come out to visit.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.922
- Hey, thanks for having
our back today.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.445
- These are from the old studs
of the Nine-Nine

20:29.489 --> 20:31.404
to the new studs.
- Aww.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.101
- Nice.
- Nice.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.363
- Well, I think they drank
out of these.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.408
They're half-empty.
- Definitely.

20:35.451 --> 20:36.452
Hitchcock's contact lens

20:36.496 --> 20:37.932
is floating in mine,

20:37.975 --> 20:39.281
which once again
begs the question,

20:39.325 --> 20:41.109
what happened to those guys?

20:41.152 --> 20:43.546
I mean, when did it all
fall apart?

20:43.590 --> 20:45.244
- Hey, Donna, just want
to make sure

20:45.287 --> 20:48.116
you're okay here working at...
Wing Slutz.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.552
- Yeah.
It's a good job,

20:49.596 --> 20:51.119
and I'm excited
about my new life.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.338
Thanks.
- Our pleas.

20:52.381 --> 20:53.861
Well, we're gonna go
hit the gym

20:53.904 --> 20:55.384
for the second time today.
- Wait.

20:55.428 --> 20:58.431
You need some protein
to fuel those hard bodies.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.476
It's on me.
- Ah, what the heck.

21:00.520 --> 21:04.437
One wing can't hurt.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.485
- ♪ Take my breath away
