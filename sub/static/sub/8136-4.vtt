00:23.356 --> 00:24.414
Now!

00:28.895 --> 00:29.919
You loved her, didn't you?

00:29.996 --> 00:30.928
Yes, I did.

00:30.997 --> 00:32.225
Cars don't talk.

00:32.298 --> 00:33.492
This one does.

00:33.566 --> 00:35.329
It talks and it catches arms.

00:35.435 --> 00:36.527
Get me out of here.

00:38.905 --> 00:41.499
He said he'd meet you
at 11:30 at the Hillside Bar.

00:41.608 --> 00:42.575
Thanks, April.

00:42.675 --> 00:44.609
Put your hands on the wheel,
sit back,

00:44.677 --> 00:46.144
and leave the driving to me.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.809
If I ever see your face again,
I'll kill you.

01:05.098 --> 01:07.623
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:07.700 --> 01:09.895
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:10.003 --> 01:12.198
who does not exist.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.578
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.647 --> 01:23.241
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent

01:23.316 --> 01:25.250
the helpless, the powerless

01:25.318 --> 01:28.549
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:01.281 --> 03:03.476
It's that prowler again.
What do you wanna do?

03:03.550 --> 03:04.642
I'll take care of it.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.895
I live with my grandmother
in Paris.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.597
My mother and father
were divorced when I was 9.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.172
I was supposed
to visit my mother

04:34.274 --> 04:36.037
after I finished
at the university.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.804
We had everything planned.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.175
Then her letters stopped
and...

04:40.313 --> 04:43.282
When I couldn't reach her
by phone, I flew to Phoenix.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.714
She's disappeared.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.513
Camela, your mother
was liberated

04:46.586 --> 04:49.180
when the phrase
still referred to countries.

04:49.255 --> 04:52.850
As I remember, it was not
unusual for her to simply pack up

04:52.925 --> 04:54.859
and take off
for days at a time.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.724
But it's been three weeks.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.957
Have you contacted
the police?

04:59.432 --> 05:01.332
They took a report.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.164
Um, I'm sorry to bother you.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.635
I didn't know
who else to turn to.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.730
You came to the right place.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.673
Don't worry, we'll
straighten everything out.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.071
But how did you
get my name?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.614
Oh, these.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.114
Your love letters
to my mother.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.762
Time's up, Michael.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.270
It's comin'.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.837
The blast from the past.
I know it, KITT, I know it.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.605
California Girls
by The Beach Boys.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.579
Oh, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.809
Michael, I don't see
the appeal of these songs.

05:50.883 --> 05:54.478
They're all about surfing,
sun, and girls in bikinis.

05:54.554 --> 05:57.489
What exactly is the allure
of Southern California?

05:57.557 --> 05:59.422
You just said it, pal.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.853
And thanks to The Foundation,
that's our next stop.

06:02.995 --> 06:04.189
Devon!

06:04.263 --> 06:06.163
Michael, I have
an urgent matter

06:06.232 --> 06:08.063
for you to deal with
in Phoenix.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.361
Phoenix?

06:09.602 --> 06:12.036
The new assignment
is in California.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.072
Sun, surf.

06:13.172 --> 06:14.571
California can wait.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.508
All right. What's up?

06:17.577 --> 06:20.546
A woman named Amelia Clermont
has disappeared.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.672
Her daughter, Camela,
will fill you in.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.410
I've put her
on The Foundation jet.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.452
She will meet you in Phoenix.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.851
Michael, this one is personal.

06:29.722 --> 06:30.916
This one is for me.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.014
I hear you, Devon.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.524
The last letter you got
in Paris from your mom

07:12.598 --> 07:13.622
was September 28.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.860
She was working full-time
at the library

07:15.968 --> 07:18.436
and doin' volunteer work
for Congressman Ebersol

07:18.538 --> 07:20.768
on Saturday,
October 11.

07:21.307 --> 07:24.674
What was the date of the
last call on her phone bill?

07:25.545 --> 07:26.842
Oh, um...

07:30.616 --> 07:33.350
October 11.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.382
Well, Michael,

07:37.590 --> 07:40.957
look at these.
Tickets for a play,

07:41.327 --> 07:43.955
a symphony,
a lecture for Greenpeace.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.091
I never knew
how many interests

07:46.165 --> 07:48.065
my mother and I
have in common.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.698
At least we know she wasn't
planning on dropping out of sight.

07:51.804 --> 07:52.793
Why?

07:52.905 --> 07:55.135
Ticket to the theater
tomorrow night.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.644
And the tickets for the
symphony sometime next week.

08:02.381 --> 08:04.576
Camela seems like
a lovely young woman, Michael.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.743
If her mother
is anything like her,

08:06.819 --> 08:08.616
I know why Devon
got us involved.

08:08.688 --> 08:12.089
And she did volunteer work for
a congressman. Very impressive.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.753
I'd be impressed if someone
there could tell us what happened.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.917
Hi.
Hello.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.287
Any luck?

08:48.027 --> 08:50.825
Oh, uh, everyone was very nice, but, uh,

08:50.897 --> 08:53.365
no one's heard from her
in three weeks.

08:54.634 --> 08:55.828
How about you?

08:55.935 --> 08:59.166
Uh-huh. Nobody's seen her
at the Congressman's office.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.405
Mrs. Farrell
at the library said

09:01.507 --> 09:04.874
she thinks my mother's the
most cultured lady in Phoenix.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.172
She says everyone likes her.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.146
What an unusual car.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.244
Are all cars in America
like this now?

09:15.321 --> 09:16.652
Not quite.

09:18.824 --> 09:21.292
Camela, meet KITT.

09:21.360 --> 09:25.353
KITT, may I present to you,
Camela Clermont.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.963
I was wondering when you were
going to introduce me

09:28.034 --> 09:31.765
to this charming and cultured
young woman. Hello, Camela.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.463
Where did that voice
come from?

09:33.573 --> 09:34.972
A computer.

09:35.608 --> 09:36.905
It talks?

09:36.976 --> 09:38.705
Sometimes to a fault.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.817
He speaks French!

09:45.885 --> 09:47.284
Fluently, I'm afraid.

09:47.353 --> 09:50.220
I've tried to interest Michael
in the romance languages,

09:50.289 --> 09:54.453
but he prefers things like rock
'n' roll and girls in bikinis.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.518
All right, KITT,
that'll do.

09:57.396 --> 09:58.624
You're hungry?

09:58.698 --> 10:00.325
I hadn't thought about it.
Why?

10:00.399 --> 10:02.799
I cook
a dynamite cheeseburger.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.392
See what I mean?

10:06.839 --> 10:08.898
I'll tell you what,
I'll drop you off

10:09.008 --> 10:10.441
while I go pick up
the fixings.

10:10.509 --> 10:11.999
That sounds
very nice, Michael.

10:27.526 --> 10:28.550
Hey, baby.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.255
Where you going, honey?

10:30.329 --> 10:32.729
Come on, let's go for
a ride. Come on, honey.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.026
How annoying.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.624
You got that right.

10:37.336 --> 10:38.325
Come on, baby.

10:38.437 --> 10:39.404
Hey!

10:39.505 --> 10:42.702
Why don't you give everybody
a break and back off, huh?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.643
Ah, it's got my arm.
It's got my arm.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.844
I'll tell you what.
I don't want trouble,

10:53.919 --> 10:56.285
you don't want any trouble.
I can see that.

10:56.355 --> 11:00.086
Why don't we call it a draw and
go on to the better things in life?

11:00.159 --> 11:01.353
Is that a deal?

11:01.427 --> 11:02.689
You let go of his arm.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.195
Then we talk deal.

11:04.263 --> 11:05.662
It's got my arm!

11:07.166 --> 11:09.327
As a gesture of good faith

11:12.104 --> 11:13.696
between men of good word.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.607
I'll see you.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.540
You can count on it.
Do you hear me?

11:19.612 --> 11:21.045
Count on it!

11:38.230 --> 11:39.197
Hi!

11:39.265 --> 11:40.596
Hi. How are you doin'?

11:40.666 --> 11:41.963
You bought a lot.

11:42.068 --> 11:46.528
Cheeseburgers, French fries,
apple pie, corn on the cob.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.864
We got everything.

11:49.608 --> 11:53.135
I mean, as they say,
"When in Rome... "

11:54.680 --> 11:55.647
What's that?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.080
I found this.

11:58.350 --> 11:59.749
It's her diary.

11:59.819 --> 12:02.982
Camela, that's fantastic. That could
tell us everything that's goin' on.

12:03.089 --> 12:06.149
Michael, this has my mother's
private thoughts.

12:06.759 --> 12:10.217
I can't just read it.

12:11.363 --> 12:12.660
If there's anyone in the world

12:12.732 --> 12:15.098
your mother would want
to share that with,

12:15.201 --> 12:16.429
it's you.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.335
Oh, what's this?

12:27.313 --> 12:30.180
I don't know. It's a
photograph of something.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.739
Can't tell what it is.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.148
And-and this?

12:33.219 --> 12:36.154
And this is a blueprint
of some kind.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.113
Tell you what.
I'm gonna take these

12:39.191 --> 12:41.386
and see what Devon and I
can come up with, okay?

12:41.460 --> 12:43.360
Oh, and, uh,

12:43.429 --> 12:45.727
I got a bill
out of the mailbox.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.863
It's for your mom.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.903
It's just the receipts
from her gas credit card.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.178
Looks like your mom
bought all her gas

13:08.254 --> 13:10.882
at the same station
here in town, except

13:11.390 --> 13:14.553
she used her card last
at Electra, Arizona.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.026
Elmo's Garage.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.426
I don't understand.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.293
What difference
could that possibly make?

13:19.365 --> 13:22.391
Well, she must have
gone out there for something.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.595
Camela, it's dated Saturday.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.037
October 11.

13:50.062 --> 13:51.825
I'm trying to find this lady.

13:51.897 --> 13:55.094
Her credit card billing said she
bought gas here on October 11.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.293
Uh, you remember her?

13:56.402 --> 13:59.098
It must be a thrill
to drive a car like this.

13:59.205 --> 14:02.003
Yeah, yeah. Well,
it has its ups and downs.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.473
Now, have you seen
this woman?

14:03.542 --> 14:06.272
Oh, yeah, as a matter of fact,
she had a sporty little car

14:06.345 --> 14:10.805
with a chunk about the size of a half
a dollar out of her left front tire.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.041
Couldn't sell her
a tire though.

14:13.118 --> 14:15.086
Haven't sold a tire
in three years.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.746
Which way did she go?
Did you notice?

14:16.822 --> 14:18.312
Yeah, that way.

14:18.390 --> 14:19.414
What's out there?

14:19.491 --> 14:22.016
Nothin's out there but
an abandoned surplus yard.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.152
Thank you.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.922
Whoa, mister, whoa!
You've got a problem.

14:28.634 --> 14:29.999
Big problem.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.535
How's my big problem, bro?

14:40.246 --> 14:41.736
It's fine.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.414
Fixed it right up.

14:43.482 --> 14:44.779
I appreciate it.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.993
Elmo's Garage is hardly
what one would call

14:56.061 --> 14:57.323
a tourist attraction.

14:57.997 --> 15:01.023
I trust we've seen the last
of Electra, Arizona.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.695
Michael, what do they
want now?

15:05.804 --> 15:07.271
Nothing good.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.716
Michael, this is
becoming tedious.

15:17.783 --> 15:20.115
You do have a way
with words, pal.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.220
Now!

15:36.702 --> 15:38.602
Hey, did you see that?

15:49.915 --> 15:51.815
I'm gonna get that guy.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.216
Good work, KITT.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.117
Child's play, Michael.

15:59.858 --> 16:03.521
Well, looks like
we've drawn a blank.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.725
I don't see
that surplus yard anywhere.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.396
Michael, my sensors
detect the presence

16:09.501 --> 16:11.992
of some kind of structure
over the next rise.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.799
Let's check it out.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.421
Bring up that picture
from Amelia's diary.

16:44.570 --> 16:45.696
Okay.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.432
Punch up a visual
of the surplus yard.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.149
Sharpen the focus
on Amelia's photo.

17:03.822 --> 17:07.223
Michael, this is virtually the
exact picture that Amelia took.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.089
Well, you got that right.

17:09.161 --> 17:10.719
Question is

17:12.330 --> 17:13.388
why?

17:15.401 --> 17:17.868
Hey, I can't help you.
Haven't seen her.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.268
We don't get much company
out here.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.397
Okay, thanks for your time.

17:40.859 --> 17:42.952
Hey, I can't help you.
Haven't seen her.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.552
The guard's voice modulation

17:44.630 --> 17:46.723
indicated stress variables,
Michael.

17:46.799 --> 17:47.993
Really?

17:49.034 --> 17:51.229
KITT, that leaves
two questions.

17:51.336 --> 17:52.963
Why would he lie?

17:54.106 --> 17:57.564
And why would Amelia be
interested in a war-surplus yard?

18:04.483 --> 18:07.577
There was someone out there
looking for Amelia Clermont.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.416
Don't worry about it.

18:09.688 --> 18:12.122
Whoever he is,
he'll poke around,

18:12.191 --> 18:14.056
find her missing,
and that will be that.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.354
It better be.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.136
Michael, I detect skid marks
at the edge of the road.

18:38.383 --> 18:41.181
KITT, get a read-out
on those skid marks.

18:41.253 --> 18:43.619
See if you can tell me
how long ago they were made.

18:47.493 --> 18:50.121
Somewhere between two weeks
and a month ago.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.595
And, Michael, my scanners
indicate the presence

18:52.664 --> 18:56.623
of copper-jacketed 20-millimeter
projectiles lodged in the road.

19:14.119 --> 19:17.316
That looks like Amelia's car.
What's left of it.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.123
KITT, activate your
X- ray mode.

19:22.628 --> 19:26.223
The car down there, is, uh, is
there any trace of human life?

19:26.965 --> 19:28.455
I'm sorry, Michael.

19:28.534 --> 19:31.162
I detect only
the remains of human life.

19:31.603 --> 19:34.163
And, Michael,
it is Amelia's car.

19:35.407 --> 19:37.102
You better get me Devon.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.039
Hello? Hello, Michael?

19:41.113 --> 19:42.045
Devon.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.046
April told me
you flew to Phoenix.

19:46.118 --> 19:47.142
Yes, this morning.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.312
I understand from Camela
you introduced her

19:49.388 --> 19:50.980
to a car that speaks
fluent French

19:51.156 --> 19:53.124
and to cheeseburgers
large enough to-

19:53.192 --> 19:54.386
Devon...

19:57.696 --> 19:59.493
I found Amelia's car.

20:01.466 --> 20:02.626
Go on.

20:05.103 --> 20:06.502
You're sure?

20:08.540 --> 20:11.805
Yeah, I see.
No, I'm all right.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.306
Thank you. I appreciate
your calling, Michael.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.608
Thank you.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.078
Devon?

20:22.154 --> 20:24.054
She's dead, isn't she?

20:26.692 --> 20:27.784
Yes.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.262
No, I'm all right. Really.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.322
I'm perfectly capable...

20:44.509 --> 20:47.774
No way a cannon fire
could destroy a car like that.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.076
Even 20 millimeter.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.343
Got any ideas, pal?

20:53.418 --> 20:54.612
None, I'm afraid.

20:54.686 --> 20:57.280
I'll settle for a probable
location of the weapon.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.520
Point of impact analysis
indicates the weapon

21:02.594 --> 21:04.562
could only have been fired
from one position.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.461
Come on, spit it out,
will you?

21:06.531 --> 21:08.055
Directly above.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.406
Is she, uh...

21:25.317 --> 21:26.716
Is she asleep?

21:26.785 --> 21:28.150
Yes, finally.

21:32.557 --> 21:34.957
I wonder what it was
Amelia found this time.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.162
What do you mean,
"this time"?

21:38.230 --> 21:39.288
Were there others?

21:39.364 --> 21:41.161
Oh. Oh, yes.

21:42.067 --> 21:45.298
She was the most inquisitive
woman I've ever known.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.837
You loved her, didn't you?

21:49.107 --> 21:50.540
Yes, I did.

21:51.443 --> 21:52.467
I think.

21:52.911 --> 21:54.936
Always at the back of my mind,

21:55.013 --> 21:58.107
there was the possibility
that one day perhaps...

22:00.152 --> 22:02.120
She married someone else.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.256
Over the years
we saw each other very seldom.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.852
But every time we did meet,

22:08.460 --> 22:11.054
it was as if
we had never been apart.

22:17.602 --> 22:18.660
Uh, I, um,

22:19.738 --> 22:23.071
I described this diagram to a
friend of mine in the Pentagon.

22:23.141 --> 22:26.338
He said he couldn't be sure, but
he thought there was a possibility

22:26.411 --> 22:29.972
that it could be part of the guidance
system of the Sledgehammer missile:

22:30.048 --> 22:31.709
a highly classified weapon.

22:31.783 --> 22:33.045
This, um,

22:33.885 --> 22:36.012
this Sledgehammer missile,

22:37.456 --> 22:38.787
what's it fired from?

22:38.857 --> 22:41.348
A helicopter
called the SX 411.

22:41.626 --> 22:45.084
The most advanced attack
helicopter in production today.

22:45.931 --> 22:49.196
I think I know what
Amelia was after out there.

22:51.536 --> 22:54.004
And I think I know
what killed her.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.237
You're awfully quiet tonight.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.209
Yeah, I guess I am, pal.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.111
Got a lot of things
on my mind.

23:10.222 --> 23:14.318
It must be very difficult to erase
people from one's memory banks.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.318
That's the problem, KITT.

23:17.996 --> 23:21.261
You don't. Can't.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.666
If that's true, they become
a permanent part of you.

23:27.172 --> 23:29.072
The best of 'em do, buddy.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.173
The best of 'em do just that.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.719
"Private property.
No trespassing. "

23:48.794 --> 23:50.785
Very hospitable, Michael.

24:10.782 --> 24:13.114
KITT, I need a locksmith
real fast.

24:21.726 --> 24:24.126
Come on, hurry up.
Hurry up, hurry up.

24:25.330 --> 24:27.298
Get out of sight, quick.

24:41.112 --> 24:44.138
Did you hear somethin'?
We'd better check it out.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.797
Michael, a guard
is approaching.

25:03.902 --> 25:04.926
Give me a diversion.

25:05.036 --> 25:06.503
Anything in particular?

25:06.605 --> 25:08.505
Use your imagination,
will you?

25:31.963 --> 25:33.430
Hey, what's happening?

25:33.498 --> 25:35.557
There's nobody
driving the tank.

25:44.509 --> 25:46.272
KITT, get over here.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.492
Devon, I'm tellin' you
I saw it.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.226
I don't doubt you, Michael.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.929
The point is that without a serial
number or some other form of firm ID,

26:12.037 --> 26:15.165
a Federal judge is not likely
to issue a search warrant.

26:15.273 --> 26:16.604
It's there now.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.768
If we're right
about the yard being a front

26:18.843 --> 26:20.174
for the sale
of illegal weapons,

26:20.245 --> 26:22.645
it's not gonna be there
very long.

26:23.782 --> 26:27.377
There's a US attorney based
here that I know. I wonder...

26:28.520 --> 26:31.421
With his influence, we may
be able to do something.

26:34.559 --> 26:37.027
I want to know what grounds
you got for a search warrant?

26:37.095 --> 26:39.893
I assure you the grounds
are sufficient and legal.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.830
Just open up,
Mr. Strock.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.062
You know, I don't know
who you are.

26:49.174 --> 26:51.369
But if you think I'll take
this lying down, you're crazy.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.308
Mr. Strock,
just open up.

27:24.009 --> 27:25.977
Michael, are you sure
this plan of Devon's

27:26.077 --> 27:27.044
is going to work?

27:27.145 --> 27:29.340
Right now, it's the only plan
we've got, pal.

27:29.414 --> 27:30.676
It could be dangerous.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.046
I hear that.

27:36.187 --> 27:37.814
Hi.
Hi.

27:37.889 --> 27:38.878
Are you ready?

27:38.957 --> 27:40.515
Yeah, I'm ready
as I'll ever be.

27:40.592 --> 27:41.684
Lock it up.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.920
What's all that?

27:42.994 --> 27:45.326
Uh, the latest
in mercenary wear.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.160
It comes pre-soiled.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.726
I have something interesting
to show you.

27:51.469 --> 27:54.063
We were able to dig up three
names of black market arms dealers

27:54.172 --> 27:55.434
in the Phoenix area.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.806
One of them is on the list of
employees at Strock's Surplus Yard.

27:58.877 --> 28:00.742
His name is Jack Kragen.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.506
The circle closes.

28:03.081 --> 28:05.515
All right.
He's where I start.

28:05.583 --> 28:08.177
After you learn the cover
I've prepared for you.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.517
Now I've got names,
dates, battles.

28:10.588 --> 28:12.749
Not to mention
dirty laundry.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.990
Michael, why is it
you never go undercover

28:20.065 --> 28:21.862
as an aristocrat or a count?

28:21.966 --> 28:23.365
Good question, KITT.

28:23.468 --> 28:25.265
Gonna have to ask Devon
about that.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.837
I'll bet not a soul
in there speaks French.

28:32.744 --> 28:34.177
And look at this alley.

28:34.245 --> 28:36.577
Look at the last car
that was left here.

28:38.616 --> 28:40.208
Keep your eyes open, huh.

29:10.048 --> 29:11.606
Jack Kragen?

29:11.683 --> 29:13.583
Who wants to know?

29:13.651 --> 29:16.779
Tom Merton.
"Machete" Tom Merton.

29:16.855 --> 29:17.981
You ain't him.

29:18.056 --> 29:19.717
No, I know that.
But he sent me.

29:19.791 --> 29:22.658
Him and I are old friends.
Name's Hutchinson.

29:22.727 --> 29:26.185
We used to fight together down in,
uh, San Victoria with the Rebels.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.528
The Black Snake Commandoes,
huh?

29:28.600 --> 29:30.033
Yeah.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.804
Hey, there's
that car again.

29:42.881 --> 29:45.076
Oh, dear, not again.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.118
The dude's
probably inside.

29:47.185 --> 29:50.086
Yeah, well, let's give him a
little surprise to come out to.

29:50.155 --> 29:51.520
Hey, Sonny.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.692
A little somethin'
for the dash.

29:54.759 --> 29:57.592
Yeah, the last time I did this,
the guy caught my arm in the window.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.355
Really freaked me out. Damn!

30:00.431 --> 30:02.160
Are you familiar
with the saying,

30:02.267 --> 30:04.235
"That'll cost you
an arm and a leg"?

30:04.335 --> 30:05.700
It talks.

30:05.804 --> 30:06.828
What, are you kiddin'?

30:07.906 --> 30:11.603
It talks. It's got my arm.
Get me out of here.

30:12.710 --> 30:14.507
Hey, man,
what have you been smokin'?

30:14.579 --> 30:16.308
Look, cars don't talk.

30:16.381 --> 30:17.678
Get me out of here!

30:17.749 --> 30:19.546
I'll get you
out of here.

30:37.068 --> 30:40.401
All right, say I've got the
contacts that can deliver.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.540
What do you got in mind?

30:45.176 --> 30:48.202
Two MERs,
multiple ejection racks

30:48.279 --> 30:50.304
adapted to handle
Sledgehammer missiles.

30:50.381 --> 30:53.111
Are you saying
you've got Sledgehammers?

30:53.184 --> 30:54.742
No, I didn't say that.

30:54.819 --> 30:57.913
What my contact has or doesn't
have, I don't even ask, man.

30:57.989 --> 31:00.321
I take orders.
He ordered two MERs.

31:00.758 --> 31:05.058
And Machete Tom told me
you might have, uh, access.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.825
Just want to let you know.

31:07.899 --> 31:10.527
If you help me
meet the deadline, I'll, uh,

31:10.635 --> 31:12.830
I'll split the bonus with you.

31:15.106 --> 31:16.733
I'll let you know.

31:18.243 --> 31:19.904
Here's my, uh,

31:20.411 --> 31:22.641
here's my girlfriend's number.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.579
You call her and tell her
if it's on

31:26.384 --> 31:27.612
or not.

31:28.219 --> 31:29.743
She'll call me.

31:31.256 --> 31:33.781
If I don't hear from you
by tomorrow noon,

31:35.260 --> 31:37.125
you've lost your sale.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.592
Won't they ever learn?

31:50.375 --> 31:52.935
That's it. I quit.
I'm goin' home.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.939
It's still got my arm.

31:55.013 --> 31:56.844
Man, I did
everything I could.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.940
What do you want me to do?
Call an ambulance?

31:59.017 --> 32:00.507
How about a tow truck?

32:00.618 --> 32:02.882
If you'll permit me,
I have a solution.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.479
See, I told you
it talks.

32:04.555 --> 32:07.956
Perhaps a lesson in manners will
be sufficient. Repeat after me.

32:08.026 --> 32:11.621
"I will, from this day forward,
become a model citizen. "

32:11.696 --> 32:13.357
"I will,
from this day forward,

32:13.431 --> 32:14.955
become a model citizen. "

32:15.033 --> 32:16.898
Somehow,
I don't feel reassured.

32:17.001 --> 32:18.366
Still, a deal is a deal.

32:24.309 --> 32:27.972
Now, in the vernacular
of the road, take a hike.

32:43.027 --> 32:45.427
KITT, there should be a
call goin' out on a pay phone

32:45.496 --> 32:48.021
from the bar, right about now.
Trace it.

32:53.338 --> 32:54.498
You're right, Michael.

32:54.605 --> 32:57.403
The call is to a phone
at 7113 Church Street.

32:57.475 --> 32:58.942
Church Street?

32:59.510 --> 33:02.377
That's Congressman Ebersol's
campaign office.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.682
He's got a buyer for a couple
of Multiple Ejection Racks.

33:06.751 --> 33:09.618
The details are your end. I just
wanna know if the buyer checks out.

33:09.687 --> 33:11.245
That's what Kragen's doing
right now.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.780
Tell him not to make a move unless he's
absolutely certain the buyer's straight.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.258
What if he doesn't call?

33:17.328 --> 33:19.660
Hang in there.
They've got an hour left.

33:28.773 --> 33:32.607
I hope you don't mind, Devon,
but I read the letters.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.741
All of them.
They're beautiful.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.714
You must have loved her
very much.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.215
Yes, I did.

33:44.522 --> 33:45.614
April.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.318
He said he'd meet you
at 11:30 at the Hillside Bar.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.553
Do you think he bought it?

33:49.627 --> 33:50.889
I think so.

33:50.962 --> 33:51.951
Thanks, April.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.466
Michael, good luck.

33:55.533 --> 33:56.465
Thanks.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.203
We are on.

34:21.659 --> 34:22.819
Hey, Jack.

34:23.327 --> 34:24.351
Hutchinson.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.828
I'm ready when you are.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.091
Sure, sure.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.694
Anything for a friend
of Machete Tom.

34:30.802 --> 34:35.000
Uh, first, though, uh, I've got
somebody I'd like you to meet.

34:38.576 --> 34:39.838
Richards!

35:06.237 --> 35:08.262
I don't know
who you are,

35:09.607 --> 35:10.767
Hutch.

35:11.442 --> 35:15.173
But I'm about to show you what
I do to people who set me up.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.808
Michael!
Are you all right?

35:45.877 --> 35:47.344
Yeah, I'm okay.

35:48.079 --> 35:50.240
I'm just sore, real sore.

35:51.582 --> 35:53.482
Michael, what happened?

35:54.886 --> 35:57.013
Richards recognized me
at the bar.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.555
He and Kragen
worked me over.

35:58.623 --> 36:02.923
A call went out last night from
Kragen to Ebersol's campaign office.

36:03.027 --> 36:06.554
Apparently, Strock is one of
Ebersol's big financial backers.

36:06.597 --> 36:07.859
And Ebersol

36:07.932 --> 36:09.832
is on
a Congressional subcommittee

36:09.901 --> 36:12.369
concerned with
illegal arms sales.

36:14.739 --> 36:17.173
The technical drawing of the
Sledgehammer's guidance system.

36:17.241 --> 36:20.836
Your mom, she must have come
across it in Ebersol's office.

36:20.912 --> 36:24.109
That's what took her out
to Strock's Surplus Yard.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.211
And that's why
they killed her.

36:32.456 --> 36:34.788
Isn't there something more
we can do?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.019
Yeah.

36:36.994 --> 36:38.859
Yeah, there is somethin'.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.229
But it's a long shot.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.791
It involves you, Camela.

36:45.436 --> 36:47.461
And your resemblance
to your mother.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.540
And it's very dangerous.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.080
You said
she was dead!

37:33.150 --> 37:34.549
Well, that's what Kragen
told me!

37:34.619 --> 37:35.643
Did he see the body?

37:35.720 --> 37:38.655
Listen, no one could survive a direct
hit from a Sledgehammer missile.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.486
Did he
see the body?

37:40.758 --> 37:42.487
What does she want?

37:42.760 --> 37:44.785
$500,000. Cash.

37:46.530 --> 37:50.364
Listen. I have an idea how we
can solve this little problem

37:50.801 --> 37:52.428
once and for all.

37:54.238 --> 37:56.229
Well, do you think
they'll take the bait?

37:56.340 --> 37:57.364
I wish I knew.

37:57.475 --> 37:59.875
I sure hope Camela
will be all right.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.504
Of course she's in
good hands, right, KITT?

38:02.613 --> 38:04.513
Of course, April.

38:05.049 --> 38:08.541
Now I'm increasing the microwave
jammer three times its normal strength.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.713
If they use the helicopter, it should
be able to knock out the engines.

38:11.789 --> 38:12.778
Should?

38:12.857 --> 38:14.324
But the only problem is,

38:14.392 --> 38:16.792
you'll have to get really
close to the helicopter.

38:16.861 --> 38:19.955
Well, how do we do that without
gettin' blown up in the process?

38:20.031 --> 38:21.896
A very good question, Michael.

38:21.966 --> 38:25.299
Unfortunately, I don't have
a very good answer.

38:26.337 --> 38:27.736
I've outfitted KITT

38:27.805 --> 38:30.603
with those prototype
ultramagnesium charges we tested.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.569
They weren't designed to
deflect heat-seeking missiles.

38:33.644 --> 38:36.340
But if all else fails,
they might work.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.310
Might?

38:38.549 --> 38:41.245
Well, it's the best I can do
on short notice.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.879
How come I don't
feel reassured here?

38:44.455 --> 38:45.615
Michael.

38:48.259 --> 38:49.624
Be careful.

38:51.095 --> 38:52.562
Thanks, April.

39:23.894 --> 39:24.826
Hi.

39:24.895 --> 39:27.090
Put your hands on the wheel,
sit back,

39:27.164 --> 39:29.098
and leave the driving to me.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.201
It's her. There she goes.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.998
Hold on, Camela.

40:30.227 --> 40:31.819
Well done, Camela.

40:31.896 --> 40:33.591
The rest is up to Michael.

40:51.315 --> 40:53.510
We're clear.
She's all yours.

40:57.388 --> 41:00.118
Michael, I believe
we have lost our tail.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.352
I believe you're right, pal.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.094
Whatever they've got
planned for us,

41:05.162 --> 41:07.187
it shouldn't be too long now.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.776
Oh, my!

41:52.643 --> 41:54.304
Missile on its way, Michael.

41:54.378 --> 41:56.869
Let's try April's
magnesium flare.

42:21.105 --> 42:24.404
Okay, buddy, looks like
he's comin' down a little bit.

42:24.475 --> 42:26.340
Let's knock out his engines!

42:40.457 --> 42:41.981
We're not bringin' him down!

42:42.059 --> 42:43.924
I gave it everything
I had, Michael.

42:43.994 --> 42:45.291
We simply must get closer.

42:45.362 --> 42:47.353
It's easy for you to say.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.736
All right, pal.
Let's give him some smoke.

43:42.219 --> 43:44.585
This is as close
as we're gonna get.

43:44.655 --> 43:47.249
All right, give me
everything you've got!

43:50.494 --> 43:53.019
All right, KITT,
jam 'em, now!

44:25.996 --> 44:27.361
Take over.

44:57.728 --> 44:59.355
Good work, Michael.

45:09.306 --> 45:11.001
Something I can
help you with?

45:11.075 --> 45:12.940
Miles, what are you
doing here?

45:13.010 --> 45:15.410
There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

45:16.213 --> 45:17.680
Amelia!

45:18.515 --> 45:20.380
Yes, I thought
you'd be surprised.

45:20.451 --> 45:24.353
However, this is not Amelia
Clermont, but her daughter, Camela.

45:27.991 --> 45:30.619
I don't know what kind of a
game you're playing. But if you-

45:30.694 --> 45:33.663
Mr. Strock, we'd like you
to come with us.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.221
You got a warrant?

45:45.542 --> 45:47.009
People believe in you.

45:47.111 --> 45:49.306
My mother
believed in you.

45:49.379 --> 45:51.745
I hope you understand. I have
no idea what's going on here.

45:51.815 --> 45:54.409
But I'm sure it's nothing
we can't resolve.

45:54.485 --> 45:56.885
I'm afraid I don't agree
with you, Congressman.

45:56.954 --> 46:00.549
But I can virtually guarantee that it
will never be resolved in your favor.

46:00.624 --> 46:03.024
Now, we don't have
all the pieces yet.

46:03.093 --> 46:05.288
But sooner or later
we will have,

46:05.362 --> 46:07.193
and when they're all
put together,

46:07.264 --> 46:09.732
I feel certain
that your political career

46:09.800 --> 46:13.292
will inevitably come to an
abrupt and irrevocable conclusion.

46:13.403 --> 46:16.600
And that's my
campaign promise to you,

46:17.841 --> 46:18.967
Congressman.

46:34.391 --> 46:35.653
Goodbye.

46:39.163 --> 46:40.391
Goodbye.

46:40.964 --> 46:42.022
Good luck.

46:42.099 --> 46:43.760
Thank you.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.542
Goodbye.

46:58.348 --> 46:59.645
Goodbye.

47:09.226 --> 47:10.955
Bon voyage, Camela.

47:25.676 --> 47:28.144
It's very difficult
giving up the past.

47:29.279 --> 47:33.079
But not so difficult when some
of it lives on in the present.

47:34.284 --> 47:37.811
Hey, why don't you two follow
us to Southern California?

47:38.589 --> 47:41.023
Well, I think
that's a wonderful idea.

47:41.091 --> 47:44.720
If I get lucky, maybe I'll get
a chance to see you in a bikini.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.927
Well, you know what they say
about luck.

47:48.999 --> 47:50.125
Yeah.

47:53.537 --> 47:54.561
What's that?

47:54.705 --> 47:56.070
A California song, Devon.

47:56.139 --> 47:58.573
It extols the attractions
of that particular area.

47:58.642 --> 48:01.611
Surfing, sun,
girls in bikinis.

48:01.712 --> 48:02.838
It's dreadful.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.075
Well, I think it's terrific.
