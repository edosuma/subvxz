**

00:16.950 --> 00:18.252
[exhaling]

00:27.961 --> 00:29.263
Morning.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.531
Good morning, sweetie.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.366
- Is there coffee?
- Yes. Gobs of it.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.068
You're headed
the wrong way.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.003
- It's right there,
princess.
- Oh, okay.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.138
Thank you.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.839
Thank you for
letting me sleep over.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.442
Yeah. You look great
in my kimono.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.776
How'd you sleep?

00:42.843 --> 00:47.081
Um, not great.
I have to be
honest with you.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.417
There's sort of a wet heat
in the turret,

00:49.483 --> 00:51.485
and I-- I couldn't
find the AC.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.787
There is no AC.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.090
But you can speak to
Sal about it when he
gets out.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.991
He's getting out?
Is his release imminent?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.793
- Mm. Parole.
- That's great.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.462
Yeah. Couple weeks.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.964
- Oh.
- Say your prayers.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.166
Does he have a plan?

01:05.233 --> 01:07.768
[chuckles]
Sal always has a plan.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.771
[chuckles] He's in for
white collar stuff, you know.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.141
The same shit that
Martha Stewart went up for.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.542
Oh, I love
Martha Stewart.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.177
Aww, look--
You look amazing.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.511
- Good morning, bitches.
- Good morning.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.546
How do you wake--
How is that possible?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.648
- Good morning.
- Oh, please.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.050
Last time I saw you,
you were on the dance floor
with that Marine,

01:23.151 --> 01:24.352
and then, poof,
you were gone.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.720
Mm-hm. He carried you
out of the club

01:26.787 --> 01:27.821
like a wounded soldier.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.723
My pussy's a
wounded soldier.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.660
[whispering]
Does she have a
pussy pussy?

01:32.726 --> 01:33.994
[laughing]

01:34.061 --> 01:35.229
I'm sorry.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.897
I'm right here, girl,
you can ask me.

01:36.964 --> 01:39.733
- Ask her. Say what
you said to me.
- Shit.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.302
May I be, uh--

01:41.369 --> 01:42.670
What, girl,
spit it out?

01:42.736 --> 01:44.738
Do you have a pussy?
I mean, do you have--

01:44.805 --> 01:46.840
- A pussy pussy.
- Oh.

01:46.907 --> 01:47.841
- Yeah.
- Oh.

01:47.908 --> 01:50.478
15 Gs, mama.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.879
Which is why
I don't understand why

01:51.945 --> 01:54.348
she's still hanging around
tranny chasers.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.083
I prefer trans amorous.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.084
[laughing]

01:57.185 --> 01:58.886
I like getting fucked.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.988
- Yeah, okay.
- Well, here's to
getting fucked.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.090
- Here's to
getting fucked.
- Yas, queen.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.525
Yes, queen.

02:04.592 --> 02:08.095
- Yas.
- Yas, queen.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.631
- That's not quite--
- Yas, queen!

02:10.698 --> 02:12.933
Okay, let's not--
Can we not do that
anymore now?

02:13.000 --> 02:13.967
She'll get there.

02:14.034 --> 02:17.205
**

03:00.047 --> 03:01.382
Uh, Jesus.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.716
Hey, hey,
hey, sweetie.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.552
Isn't that your friend
Tennessee over there?

03:04.618 --> 03:06.354
Why don't you just go ahead
and run in with her?

03:06.420 --> 03:08.256
- Mom. Mommy, walk me in.
- No, no, no,

03:08.289 --> 03:09.957
- I'm really late,
and I got--
- Please?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.892
I got so much I have to do.
I'm sorry, sweetie.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.728
Listen, um, don't forget
it's Daddy's weekend, okay?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.564
- I'm gonna miss you
like crazy.
- Okay.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.532
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.567
[sighs]

03:21.469 --> 03:23.337
Barb: So, yeah,
just look over
all the papers,

03:23.404 --> 03:24.572
and then
sign right there.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.939
- Yep.
- Oh, okay.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.941
[indistinct chatter]

03:30.778 --> 03:33.647
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Sarah.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.948
How's it goin'?

03:35.015 --> 03:36.149
- It's goin' all right.
- Yeah?

03:36.284 --> 03:37.184
Yeah.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.686
What's all this?

03:38.752 --> 03:40.120
It's the Nitty Gritty
Committee.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.890
You know,
trash pick up,
make posters,

03:42.956 --> 03:44.191
sort e-waste,
you know.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.993
Whatever falls through
the cracks.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.997
It's perfect for parents
that want to appear like
they give a shit.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.301
[laughing]
That's perfect for me.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.936
Uh, no,
you're not, uh--

03:56.003 --> 03:59.507
There, no, this--
You can't be a part
of my committee.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.876
Uh, yeah,
uh, okay, I get it.
I totally get that.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.313
I just--
I thought I should
sign up for something.

04:05.379 --> 04:09.016
I mean, I don't know.
It's like everybody's
doin' something, and--

04:09.082 --> 04:12.820
Listen, I don't--
I don't know what--
what people know.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.324
A lot of people know
a lot of things.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.392
- People gossip.
- Great. Thanks.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.728
- Yeah.
- Well, that feels better.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.797
Um, I mean, you know,
I don't have to do that.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.199
We could just go get coffee
or something if you want.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.068
[scoffs]
Coffee? No.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.103
I'm not goin' to get
coffee with you.

04:30.170 --> 04:34.041
[scoffs] Look,
I'm sorry if my boundary
is your trigger.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.944
I don't know what
that means, but okay.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.552
All right.
Bring it in.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.354
The eagle has landed.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.721
Um, let's go in there.
You'll be in my room.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.257
- This way? Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.359
- This one?
- Yeah.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.860
Right to the left.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.495
- Wow.
- So, look,
the bedding is old.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.929
I'm gonna get you
some new bedding.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.865
- No, that's fine.
- And the lamp's broken,

04:57.931 --> 05:01.001
but, uh, I saw a
cool little lamp
at the MOCA store.

05:01.068 --> 05:04.638
And, uh, this, I--
I did get this for you
ahead of time.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.040
Leather scented candle.
Check it.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.075
- Dang.
- [clears throat] Yeah.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.943
That's awesome.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.245
- Good?
- Yeah, that's, um,
that's great, man.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.447
Thank you.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.449
Hey, uh,
this may sound dumb,

05:15.516 --> 05:19.387
but, um,
you're cool with me
calling you Dad?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.154
Yeah, I think so.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.923
Do I need to
think about that?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.025
I'm thinkin' about it.
The answer is yes.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.126
- Okay.
- All right.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.095
- You're sure?
- Yeah, totally.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.863
Do you want help
unpacking?

05:29.930 --> 05:31.198
No, no, no.
Thank you so much.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.433
- Okay.
- It's not much.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.101
- Yeah, thank you.
- All right. All right.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.536
- Uh--
- All right, good.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.637
- Want a hug?
- Yeah.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.871
All right.
All right.

05:42.910 --> 05:46.146
Oh, dude, right here,
right this spot under
the stairwell,

05:46.213 --> 05:47.415
no-man's land,

05:47.448 --> 05:49.583
shit went down, dog.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.285
- During school?
- Feel that?

05:52.420 --> 05:53.487
Yeah, during school.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.423
Oh, lucky number 11.
Here it is.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.890
Oh. See if I can
remember.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.291
That's-- that's my
favorite number.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.027
Fuck it. No way.
Here we go!

06:01.429 --> 06:02.996
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.566
- You just broke that.
- I know.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.901
So-- so, what,
were you like a--
a player?

06:07.968 --> 06:09.670
Oh, I had my fun,
but what about you?

06:09.737 --> 06:12.039
You're a good looking kid.
I bet you did all right.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.908
I mean, I've--
I guess I've known
a few girls

06:14.975 --> 06:16.444
in a Biblical sense.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.779
- Really?
- Four or five a least.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.548
Wait, wait, wait wait.
Four or five different girls,

06:20.614 --> 06:22.249
or, like, four or five
different times?

06:22.315 --> 06:24.284
Different girls.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.886
Never told anybody
that before.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.755
- Well, let's go
make you legal.
- Yeah.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.189
Josh: What about
Mr. Slaughter?

06:29.256 --> 06:31.825
- Is he still here?
- Nope. Not here anymore.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.962
Ooh, um, Mr. Irons,
head discipline dude.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.197
No, long gone.
Now him I've heard of,

06:37.264 --> 06:38.331
heard the stories.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.800
The dude was hard core.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.535
He used to
walk the halls
with a paddle.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.103
Crazy days.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.239
Actual job title
on his door,
"Disciplinarian."

06:46.306 --> 06:48.476
Okay, so you're
his legal guardian?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.811
Uh, no.

06:50.878 --> 06:54.047
I am his
biological father.

06:55.583 --> 06:59.252
But, you know, we can get the
legal guardians to sign this.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.489
It's just, um,
a little complicated,

07:01.489 --> 07:03.123
but he is living with me.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.725
And you live
in the district?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.193
Check.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.597
Okey-dokey, Colton.
Welcome to the
Pacific Palisades.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.165
Thank you.
And would it be possible--

07:12.232 --> 07:14.167
Could I get
locker number 11?

07:15.503 --> 07:17.505
Ali:
But it feels like nepotism.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.772
Maura:
It's not nepotism.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.040
I just want to
introduce you to

07:20.107 --> 07:21.374
a few of my connections.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.911
Ali: I may not want to
stay in L.A. for grad school.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.913
There he is.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.217
Hello, Carl.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.352
Professor Pfefferman,
look at you.

07:32.419 --> 07:33.921
Thank you.
So good to see you.

07:33.987 --> 07:34.722
You, too.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.524
- May we sit?
- Please.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.526
- Thank you.
- Sit, sit.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.961
- So...
- So, how are things?

07:41.028 --> 07:43.296
- How's Hobsy?
- Oh, Hobsy's doin' fine.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.532
You know what he's like.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.866
He's gonna be here
forever.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.535
Yes, he is 'cause
he's un-hirable.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.637
Carl:
Yeah, I thought you could
take him with you.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.104
[laughs]
He's on his third wife.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.406
- He's got money.
- Oh, is that right?

07:53.541 --> 07:55.909
- Oh, absolutely.
- Oh, Leslie.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.546
Leslie, this is the person
I want you to meet.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.847
- Ali Pfefferman.
- Hi.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.049
- Leslie Mackinaw.
- Hi.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.083
- Hi.
- Ali.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.284
Ali. Pleasure.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.053
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.722
Leslie, your name
is so familiar.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.123
Did I read you
in undergrad?

08:10.190 --> 08:12.125
Is that right?
Are-- you're a poet.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.360
I am indeed.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.862
Yeah.
Oh, you're great.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.930
[chuckles]
Thank you very much.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.600
Yeah,
I thought Leslie would be
the perfect person for you

08:19.667 --> 08:22.069
to learn something
about women's studies.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.973
Oh, I'm afraid you'd have to
go someplace else for that.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.676
Woman is a dirty word
around here.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.811
I am a highly placed
staff member

08:30.878 --> 08:34.381
in the newly named
Gender Studies Department.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.149
Right, of course.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.586
And I know you.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.753
That's right, we know
each other right?

08:39.820 --> 08:42.022
Were you-- were we
at Berkeley together?

08:42.089 --> 08:44.625
- Mm-hm.
- What? What is it?

08:44.692 --> 08:46.894
You edited
"Perspective on Politics."

08:46.960 --> 08:48.161
- I did.
- Uh-huh.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.697
- I did, for several years.
- Yeah.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.031
Yes. Did we publish you?

08:51.098 --> 08:55.002
I applied for
the editorial board.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.670
And you blocked me.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.272
I block-- I didn't block.
I've never blocked anybody.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.609
But I--
I mean, you--

09:01.609 --> 09:04.277
You were one of
the applicants or--?

09:04.344 --> 09:09.750
Uh, yeah, and I applied
every year for ten years.

09:09.817 --> 09:13.887
Me and my sisters-in-arms
and I applied, and applied,

09:13.954 --> 09:17.991
applied, and applied.
And you took only men.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.995
Oh, and one chick who had
these huge, huge tits

09:22.062 --> 09:24.531
that you-- you couldn't
keep your eyes off of,

09:24.632 --> 09:26.900
if-- if I remember
correctly.

09:29.036 --> 09:29.803
Oh, my God,

09:29.870 --> 09:31.138
you were part of
that group?

09:31.204 --> 09:32.339
[chuckling]

09:32.405 --> 09:34.541
Well, it's very nice of you
to remember.

09:34.642 --> 09:38.245
The Berkeley Seven.
We were the scourge
of the administration.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.780
We drove out a provost.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.314
What is a provost?

09:41.381 --> 09:42.449
Exactly.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.151
Leslie, I just
want to say this,

09:44.217 --> 09:47.287
I don't stand behind
what I-- what I did
back then. All right?

09:47.354 --> 09:49.990
Uh, and I
profoundly apologize
if that does--

09:50.057 --> 09:52.325
If that does you any good.
I actually don't--

09:52.392 --> 09:53.526
I don't remember
much of it.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.162
Well, why would you
remember it?

10:38.471 --> 10:41.041
[indistinct chatter]

10:41.108 --> 10:42.710
Len: Here we go.
Here we go.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.545
[yelling]

10:45.612 --> 10:48.315
Len: Fuck.
Okay, time out.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.118
Hold on. Time out.
I'll be right back.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.320
That scared the shit
out of me.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.454
Did you let yourself in?

10:54.521 --> 10:55.622
- Yeah.
- Don't do that.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.656
- I, um--
- Please don't do that.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.859
I just forgot
my yoga mat,

10:58.926 --> 11:01.028
- so I wanted to come by.
- Okay, well, it's like a
fuckin' ghost.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.295
That scared the shit
out of me.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.731
- Hey, guys.
- Mom.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.733
- Hey.
- Mom, what are you
doing here?

11:05.766 --> 11:06.900
It's not your day.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.002
Yeah, I'm aware.
I just, um,

11:09.069 --> 11:10.637
forgot my yoga mat,
so I thought I'd--

11:10.738 --> 11:11.772
Mommy's here for
a very quick visit.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.573
Come by and
pick it up.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.743
- Hey, Barb.
- What's up?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.077
Seeing you again.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.211
How's it goin'?

11:18.278 --> 11:21.048
Good, just hangin' out
with the kids.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.883
How's it goin'?
How'd the...

11:22.950 --> 11:24.985
Itty Bitty Titty
Committee work out?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.519
It's not a
titty committee.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.222
It's, uh--
It's Nitty Gritty.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.357
I was just kidding.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.794
Hey, Barb, if you guys
want to hang out,

11:33.861 --> 11:35.328
I'll tell Melanie to
get some more grouper.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.130
- Yeah. I love fish.
- And some wine.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.566
[chuckles]
Your girlfriend's
getting grouper.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.234
Sounds like a party.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.370
It's not a party,
it's just dinner.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.873
It's what people do,
they get together and
they eat grouper.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.408
Grillin' grouper.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.509
Enjoy each other's
company.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.944
Gonna go grill
some grouper.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.814
Cool. I'm just gonna
grab my yoga mat.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.409
[spraying]

12:46.499 --> 12:47.935
[kids laughing]

12:49.736 --> 12:51.839
Oh, fuck!

12:54.307 --> 12:55.475
Oh, fuck!

12:57.878 --> 12:59.279
[water running]

13:03.383 --> 13:04.351
Oh, my God!

13:16.029 --> 13:19.132
Shortly after I
transitioned,
I met this guy.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.969
I was at the
Sprint store
with my niece,

13:22.035 --> 13:23.871
my four-year-old niece,

13:23.904 --> 13:26.539
and he walks up to me
and he asks me,

13:26.606 --> 13:27.908
"So, do you date?"

13:27.975 --> 13:30.610
And so I'm, like, well--
well, yeah, I date.

13:30.677 --> 13:34.347
And then he asked me,
"So, uh, how much
do you charge?"

13:34.414 --> 13:35.916
"How much
do you charge?"

13:35.983 --> 13:38.185
[laughing]

13:38.251 --> 13:40.220
I mean,
as a trans woman,

13:40.287 --> 13:42.289
I appreciate
that you want me
because I'm trans,

13:42.355 --> 13:43.790
I'm good with that.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.759
It's the inappropriate,
asking me things like,

13:46.894 --> 13:48.528
are you
fully functional?

13:48.595 --> 13:49.897
Fucking rude.

13:49.897 --> 13:50.931
I think these guys,

13:50.998 --> 13:53.066
a lot of them
are closet cases.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.936
They're internally
homophobic or trans-phobic,

13:56.003 --> 13:57.637
and this is how
they express it.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.139
Some of them are able

13:59.206 --> 14:01.174
to go through
transition themselves.

14:01.241 --> 14:05.278
Others are stuck and
they'll never get past it.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.449
You know, you've been
fairly quiet,

14:09.516 --> 14:12.920
what's going on
in your mind right now?

14:12.920 --> 14:17.590
[sighs]
I met somebody
today, uh...

14:17.657 --> 14:20.193
I knew back in the day.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.430
Uh, we were at Berkeley,
and, um--

14:24.932 --> 14:26.399
She was part of this
radical feminist group,

14:26.466 --> 14:28.201
they were called
the Berkeley Seven.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.470
They burned effigies of us.

14:30.537 --> 14:34.241
They thought that we were
holding them back.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.445
And we did.
We held them back.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.247
That's the truth.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.316
I mean...

14:43.383 --> 14:44.351
I hurt people.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.025
So I'm gonna
FedEx the forms
to his parents,

14:52.092 --> 14:53.526
get that all
squared away.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.096
Enrolled. Bam!
So easy.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.497
He's so sweet.
I swear to God.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.066
- Yeah, he is.
- You should have seen him.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.268
The impression he made.
It was incredible.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.103
I mean, I--
We haven't even
talked about this,

15:03.170 --> 15:05.505
but I'm assuming
that he's--

15:05.572 --> 15:06.839
he's gonna just move
down to that room in
the basement, right?

15:06.974 --> 15:08.075
Like, midway through
this year,

15:08.141 --> 15:09.676
because we're gonna
need his room for

15:09.742 --> 15:11.044
- little peanut.
- Oh, yeah,

15:11.111 --> 15:13.346
I will kick his ass
down to the basement.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.983
That boy will heed me.
You heard?

15:16.049 --> 15:18.418
I bet he will.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.887
I was reading this article
about adopted kids,

15:20.988 --> 15:23.156
and it was just
talking about how they're
performing all the time,

15:23.223 --> 15:25.158
because they just
want to be kept.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.861
Um, yeah.
He's not doin' that.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.531
- I mean, maybe he's not.
- My boy is white bread.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.566
Hey.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.002
What's goin' on?

15:35.002 --> 15:37.004
What's up?

15:37.037 --> 15:38.871
Is it too much?

15:39.006 --> 15:42.309
[laughs]
Yeah.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.280
I got lists, Joshy.
You-- I know.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.082
You know,
all the time, just--

15:49.149 --> 15:50.617
Mm-hm. Yeah, I know.
I know.

15:50.683 --> 15:51.784
Do you?
Do you know now?

15:51.851 --> 15:52.819
I do.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.221
- Do ya?
- I do. I do.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.423
You know what's at
the top of my list
right now?

15:56.489 --> 15:58.091
What's that?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.027
Me going to temple.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.395
I get to teach a class
who, every week,

16:02.462 --> 16:05.198
- watch my belly grow--
- Oh.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.399
And then just glance up
at this naked finger.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.301
- That's all.
- Say no more.

16:08.368 --> 16:12.272
- Okay.
- You can check that shit
off your list right now.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.474
I'm serious.
Hey.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.508
Good night, Josh.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.877
I got this.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.046
[door closes]

16:19.079 --> 16:22.149
**[guitar]

16:22.215 --> 16:27.287
* There's a
new world comin' *

16:27.354 --> 16:33.193
* And it's just
around the bend *

16:33.260 --> 16:38.265
* There's a
new world comin' *

16:38.331 --> 16:44.137
* This one's
comin' to an end *

16:44.204 --> 16:49.542
* There's a
new voice callin' *

16:49.609 --> 16:52.245
* You can hear it
if you try *

16:55.215 --> 17:00.087
* And it's growin' stronger *

17:00.153 --> 17:03.390

17:05.825 --> 17:08.395
Woman 1: It was really crazy.
Woman 2: What?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.763
Woman 1: You know.
All right, I got it.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.400
You get one of those,
like, skywriters,

17:13.466 --> 17:16.103
and say,
"Marry me, baby."

17:16.169 --> 17:17.437
- Yeah.
- What about a
Saint Bernard?

17:17.504 --> 17:18.938
Around its collar
you can put, like, a--

17:19.005 --> 17:20.207
a big yellow diamond
on it.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.608
- A yellow diamond?
- A yellow one.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.110
- On a Saint Bernard?
- It's different.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.145
You could do, uh,
a scavenger hunt

17:25.212 --> 17:27.314
- with a map and clues.
- Yeah, if she was 13.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.116
Is that how we're
gonna do it?

17:29.182 --> 17:31.951
I feel like Colton
would know how to get
the job done right.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.153
Wouldn't you,
cutie pie?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.188
[laughs]
Uh, no, no.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.157
Well, I mean,
yeah, but, uh--

17:37.224 --> 17:38.725
I don't know,
it'd probably be
something like a--

17:38.791 --> 17:41.594
I don't know,
a horse and carriage
or something stupid.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.530
- [all exclaiming]
- Oh, my God,
I literally love--

17:43.596 --> 17:45.198
If you asked me like that,
I would say yes.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.833
You gotta get that ring first,
though, right?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.935
- My God.
- Design it, order it,
all that shit. Right?

17:49.001 --> 17:51.204
Josh, I got-- I got
your diamond guy,
no problem.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.440
My cousin Esther Lee's
married to Leonard Reefman.
He's downtown.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.607
- Oh, for real?
- Yeah, no, for real.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.376
He's works with
those little old--

17:56.443 --> 17:58.311
the little old men
with the peering in
the thing with the--

17:58.378 --> 17:59.346
Circumcise
the diamonds for you.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.547
The diamond mohels.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.048
That is what I need,
a diamond mohel.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.483
Honestly,
he's unbelievable.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.385
Wait, wait. Hold on.
Hold on a second. Hold on.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.419
* You know the one
I'm talkin' about *

18:06.486 --> 18:07.920
This part right here.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.423
* The one we've had
visions of *

18:10.490 --> 18:13.293
* Comin' in peace,
comin' in joy *

18:13.360 --> 18:14.527
I don't hate this.

18:15.462 --> 18:18.598
So, what are you
gonna do, Joshy?

18:18.665 --> 18:21.634
Oh, my God,
I think Josh has
a proposal idea.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.470
- What?
- Why aren't you
telling us?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.772
Do you know?
What are you gonna do, dude?

18:25.838 --> 18:27.207
You better tell us
right now.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.741
- [laughs] No.
- Look at his face.

18:28.808 --> 18:29.776
- No.
- Tell us.

18:29.842 --> 18:30.977
You're being so lame.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.213
Jumbotron.
Jumbotron,
Clippers game.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.814
[laughter]

18:37.016 --> 18:40.620
* Comin' in love *

18:43.190 --> 18:44.824
Shit, yes, I have
read her stuff.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.359
I knew it.
In college.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.861
Fuck, I'm so pissed at myself
for having a drunken,

18:48.928 --> 18:50.263
date rape-y
freshman year.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.433
Okay, "Leslie Mackinaw,
an American poet and critic

18:53.500 --> 18:55.668
"who has published
more than 40 volumes
of fiction, poetry--"

18:55.735 --> 18:57.637
and looky here,
even one libretto.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.938
Look at these
bowling guns.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.407
- Nice.
- Boom.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.210
Hey, you guys.
Have you guys heard of
Leslie Mackinaw?

19:03.276 --> 19:04.877
Yes, I'm a lesbian,
of course I have.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.547
Yeah, I had a girlfriend
who named her cat after
Leslie Mackinaw.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.781
- No.
- So did I.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.782
Oh, my God.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.651
Is that perhaps
the same ex girlfriend?

19:11.718 --> 19:14.787
Yeah, she would, like,
basically be Jack Kerouac

19:14.854 --> 19:17.524
or Allen Ginsberg
if we didn't grow up
in a patriarchy.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.526
If we didn't grow up
in a patriarchy?

19:19.592 --> 19:22.128
Both: If we did not
grow up in a patriarchy.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.231
I mean, I think
she lives in Oakland,

19:24.264 --> 19:25.932
or some other
northern lesbianish--

19:25.998 --> 19:27.367
No, no.
She's at UCLA,

19:27.434 --> 19:28.701
'cause Ali might go there
for grad school.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.102
- Holy fuck.
- Interesting.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.772
Holy fuck, you guys,
this poem!
