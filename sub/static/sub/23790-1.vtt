The new<i> Star Wars</i> movies

00:56.222 --> 00:59.642
They're not new. They're just ruining
the originals with digital garb.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.270
Whatever. They're gonna be Phat, Ph.

01:02.353 --> 01:05.398
Well, gee, thanks for clarifying.
I thought you meant obese.

01:05.482 --> 01:09.527
-Let's go, gentlemen, we're late.
-We were waiting for you. You're late.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.739
Luke, you do realize that A/V Club
is the lowliest of electives?

01:12.822 --> 01:15.158
It's beneath choir.
It's beneath weather club.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.661
They should combine choir

We might as well start with something
we know.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.713
That's A/V club.

01:28.797 --> 01:32.383
Yeah. Once they see one of our movies,
the ladies will come flocking.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.762
I promise you, there isn't
a single female behind those doors.

01:36.304 --> 01:39.766

He was just messing with us.
She's the principal's daughter. So what?

He compared her to the most dangerous
radioactive material on the planet.

is like painting a target on your face.

08:51.822 --> 08:54.075

Uh, provided we don't copulate
on school grounds.

11:58.300 --> 12:02.179
I'm not attracted to you, Ken.
Physically, like, at all.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.188
You okay?

12:12.314 --> 12:13.732
Of course, yeah. I--

12:14.942 --> 12:18.362
I'm glad you said something, actually.
I-- honesty.

12:18.446 --> 12:23.409
Just, brutal honesty,
it's just the best policy.

12:23.492 --> 12:27.163
I-I can only thank you for that.
I appreciate this.

12:28.789 --> 12:29.957
Friends?

12:31.542 --> 12:33.669
Colleagues, might be better.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.797
Colleagues. Yeah, hey, I'll take it!

12:38.299 --> 12:39.425
Oh, and Ken?

12:39.508 --> 12:40.634
Yeah?

12:40.968 --> 12:43.053
-The copier's low on toner.
-Oh.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.559
[sighs]

12:51.729 --> 12:52.813
[Luke] Nice shirt.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.981
[Kate] Thanks.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.317
[Luke] So, what's up with Tori Amos?

12:56.859 --> 12:58.819
Uh, you've never heard of Tori Amos?

12:58.903 --> 13:03.657
Well-- well, I've heard of her,
but I don't know her music that well.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.455
-You like her?
-Uh, yeah. She's amazing.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.166
She's like nothing
you've ever heard before.

13:12.249 --> 13:14.293
Oh, cool. Like what?

13:15.961 --> 13:16.962
Um...

13:17.713 --> 13:20.424
I don't know. How can I explain
if you've never heard it?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.176
You can try.

13:23.719 --> 13:24.845
Okay.

13:25.304 --> 13:29.308
Well, there's this one song where
halfway through she just starts crying.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.686
And it's her just singing
and playing the piano and crying.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.063
And it's just so real.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.105
Wow.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.651
And her first album is called
<i>Little Earthquakes.</i>

13:38.734 --> 13:40.903
-Know what that means?
-No.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.321
Orgasms.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.908
Like, she totally named
an entire album after orgasms.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.412
Or that's what I heard.

13:50.913 --> 13:51.747
Oh.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.001
Sounds bad ass.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.470
Oh, hey, man.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.391
Hey, would you take a picture of us
in front of the sign?

14:12.142 --> 14:13.394
-[Luke] Okay.
-[man] All right.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.105
[Luke] Ready.

14:16.855 --> 14:20.109
-One, two and...
-[camera shutter clicks]

14:22.236 --> 14:24.864
You ever notice they never actually go
into town?

14:26.490 --> 14:29.243
They just find the sign,
take a picture, then leave.

14:30.744 --> 14:31.996
Lucky them.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.963
[Luke] Oh, sweet! Columbia House.

14:41.505 --> 14:42.631
Hold this.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.135
-[Kate] What'd you get?
-Let's see.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.095
New Oasis.

14:48.178 --> 14:51.724
-That's supposed to be good.
-Yeah, well, I already have it. [chuckles]

14:52.182 --> 14:54.018
I forgot to mail the thing back.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.561
You want it?

14:55.644 --> 14:59.940
Oh, oh, thanks, but you can get a lot
of store credit for that.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.985
Oh, no, it's, it's fine really. Take it.

15:05.654 --> 15:06.906
[chuckles]

15:07.573 --> 15:08.908
Thanks.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.249
Sorry about the dust.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.126
Feel free to look around.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.217
So, how do you know
so much about cameras?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.763
My dad used to be a wedding videographer.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.183
He showed me some stuff when I was a kid.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.311
I guess it just kinda
comes naturally to me.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.646
What's he do now?

15:38.729 --> 15:39.980
Who, my dad?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.066
Who cares?

15:42.983 --> 15:45.027
He bailed on me and my mom
when I was seven.

15:46.278 --> 15:50.491
If you look up "deadbeat dad,"
there'd be a picture of Leroy O'Neil.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.160
Apparently, he's in Hollywood now.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.704
Do you miss him?

15:56.497 --> 15:57.623
No.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.629
What about your mom?

16:03.712 --> 16:06.423
She's, uh, five miles
above the Atlantic right now.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.051
What?

16:09.760 --> 16:10.761
She's a flight attendant.

16:13.222 --> 16:17.226
Sometimes she's gone for a whole week,
which kinda rules.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.853
I get to stay up late.
Rent rated "R" movies.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.690
They know me at Video Shack,
which is cool.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.235
I'm more like an adult
than a teenager, really. So...

16:31.031 --> 16:32.032
What's on these?

16:33.409 --> 16:34.743
Oh, I don't know.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.038
I think they were my dad's.
I've been meaning to check them out.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.208
What made you join A/V?

16:43.502 --> 16:45.129
It seemed mellow, I guess.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.215
My dad was trying to get me
to run for ASB.

16:48.298 --> 16:52.428
It's like I have to be some
exemplary student 'cause of who he is.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.763
Sucks.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.475
Mr. Messner.
You know, he actually seems kinda cool.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.145
Not the term I would use.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.523
What about Mrs. Messner?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.525
She died.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.196
Sorry.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.824
How'd it happen?

17:13.907 --> 17:15.200
She was sick.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.914
We don't...
you don't have to talk about it.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.166
It's all good.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.543
[Kate] It's okay.

17:26.086 --> 17:29.256
After she died,
they made me talk to a counselor.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.552
[scoffs] What's a five-year-old supposed
to say to a counselor?

17:34.303 --> 17:38.098
And they had me make this
stupid arts and crafts project.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.768
It's called a Scream Box. [chuckles]

17:40.851 --> 17:44.772
And I was supposed to scream into it
whenever I needed.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.940
I never used it.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.359
My dad did though.

17:51.779 --> 17:56.575
And then, I came back to school,
and everyone stopped talking to me

17:56.658 --> 17:59.244
because they knew
I didn't have a mom anymore.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.208
I wanted to disappear.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.128
It's like I actually did, kind of.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.388
How's it look?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.893
Oh, perfect.

18:22.976 --> 18:23.977
[clears throat]

18:25.104 --> 18:26.396
Like new.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.776
Sure you don't want anything for the road?
Like a Pop Tart?

18:30.859 --> 18:33.278
Hi-C? P, B and J?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.239
[Kate] You're cute.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.532
See you on Monday.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.622
I'm cute.

is that you don't have to look
