WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.633
Iran's program is dormant now,

00:07.675 --> 00:10.302
and this guy wants to keep it
that way. This guy does not.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.929
TOM: We're gonna try
to buy this election.

00:11.971 --> 00:13.848
We've got the guy to do that,
we just need you

00:13.889 --> 00:15.683
to get him the money,
and then come and go from Iran

00:15.725 --> 00:18.144
in the fall to make sure that
it gets to where we need it.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.854
How?

00:19.895 --> 00:20.896
TOM: McMillan is
an oil infrastructure

00:20.938 --> 00:22.148
engineering firm.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.899
This project's gonna play out

00:23.941 --> 00:26.485
in two places:
Iran and Luxembourg.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.404
McMillan comes and goes
both places.

00:28.446 --> 00:32.324
All you got to do is bring a bag
of money from "A" to "B," John.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.118
It's never easy like that.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.494
Any time you're ready,
there, Lakeman.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.079
I'm gonna have
to check this bag.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.890
Thank you.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.560
Yeah.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.399
TOM (over phone):
Our guy? The bag? Gone.

01:05.441 --> 01:08.068
He never landed in Iran.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.070
He doesn't seem
to have left Luxembourg.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.364
I authorized the illegal use
of American money

01:12.406 --> 01:13.991
to influence
a foreign election,

01:14.033 --> 01:15.409
then I gave the money
to the bad guy,

01:15.451 --> 01:17.578
and he's gonna use that money

01:17.620 --> 01:19.455
to put Iran back
on the path to active.

01:19.497 --> 01:21.373
Their weapons program.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.126
The physicist's wife,
she's going to get the money.

01:28.464 --> 01:30.132
He doesn't have the bag.

01:30.174 --> 01:32.301
Bag got away from him.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.386
TOM: How? He had one transfer,
"A" to "B."

01:34.428 --> 01:37.389
JOHN: I've been told that
before, on occasion.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.517
TOM: At this point,
we had a strong expectation

01:39.558 --> 01:41.977
that we would recover the bag.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.021
The only real impediment
to recovery and reestablishing

01:44.063 --> 01:45.898
the plan was the guy
with the girl's name.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.566
LESLIE:
Let's come together,

01:47.608 --> 01:50.277
then let's head off
to Luxembourg a fortified unit,

01:50.319 --> 01:53.572
and get this goddamn
Denon deal done.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.659
Except for Lakeman,
who's simply not going.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.080
Ah! Jesus.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.166
You shot me in the fucking face!

02:04.208 --> 02:06.001
-What is this?
-NURSE: Morphine, for the pain.

02:06.043 --> 02:10.673
It feels like flying

the recommended

02:15.845 --> 02:16.929
eight hours of sleep, John?

02:16.971 --> 02:19.223
-No.
-What are you getting?

02:19.265 --> 02:20.432
Much less.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.475
GREGORY:
Like, how many hours?

02:21.517 --> 02:23.060

Where's the... the money?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.851
I left it back there.

03:03.893 --> 03:06.478
In the police building.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.605
Next to the lion.

They're not American dimes.

Matters had escalated.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.404
In the calmer instances,
before this?

27:36.739 --> 27:38.783
Mistakes and errors were made

27:38.824 --> 27:40.368
due to decisions.

27:40.409 --> 27:43.954
Say, for two people to intersect
who shouldn't.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.957
In this new area,

27:46.999 --> 27:49.335
this heightened phase
of greater danger,

27:49.377 --> 27:52.254
due to the urgent need
to move around,

27:52.296 --> 27:56.258
these dangerous
convergences occurred...

27:56.300 --> 28:00.304
due to shared,
limited conditions.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.474
Parallel needs.

28:03.516 --> 28:04.767
If you needed to flee

28:04.809 --> 28:07.728
the greater area of, say,
Luxembourg immediately,

28:07.770 --> 28:11.482
well, there are only
40 flights a day to Luxembourg.

28:11.524 --> 28:14.402

28:14.443 --> 28:15.569

So, if you're in jeopardy,
and need to flee,

28:21.033 --> 28:24.203
or to reach this greater area,
you go to Paris.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.166
you must necessarily

who are in these same states
of jeopardy and haste.

And these intersections,

39:15.604 --> 39:18.607
to defend the United States
and its interests.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.400
For America, for the world.

39:20.442 --> 39:23.528
-Hey, Tom?
-Yeah.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.072
Why don't you just stop?

39:25.113 --> 39:29.326
And take responsibility,
and let your son go home?

39:29.367 --> 39:31.328
Has that ever occurred to you?

39:31.369 --> 39:32.871
OBAMA: ...such talk
has only benefited

39:32.913 --> 39:35.040
the Iranian government,

39:35.082 --> 39:37.667
-by driving up the price of oil.
TOM: You should...

39:37.709 --> 39:40.462
probably stay with us.

39:40.504 --> 39:42.672
You think I'm gonna let her go?

39:42.714 --> 39:46.885
I think you should
just stay with us.

39:46.927 --> 39:48.887
She's waking up.

39:48.929 --> 39:50.889
I'm gonna go sit with her
in the car

39:50.931 --> 39:52.766
so she doesn't draw attention.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.810
I think you're a coward.

39:54.851 --> 39:58.146
Stay there, just for a moment.

40:03.151 --> 40:07.614
I know all this seems
extraordinary to you.

40:07.656 --> 40:10.826
And it's unusual.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.453
It is unusual, yes.

40:13.495 --> 40:16.373
But it's not
extraordinary for me,

40:16.414 --> 40:18.583
to be in these circumstances.

40:18.625 --> 40:22.879
I'm, ordinarily, Alice,
subjected to scrutiny,

40:22.921 --> 40:26.675
and suspected of transgressions
like these.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.885
That's my job.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.096
It's also my job
not to get caught.

40:31.138 --> 40:33.932
And it's imperative I do my job.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.937
(applause on TV)

40:38.979 --> 40:40.772
I have said that when it comes
to preventing Iran

40:40.814 --> 40:42.774
from obtaining a nuclear weapon,

40:42.816 --> 40:47.320
I will take no options off the
table, and I mean what I say.

40:47.362 --> 40:51.032
(applause on TV)

40:51.074 --> 40:55.996
That includes all elements
of American power.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.456
He's not talking about the Navy.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.879
Alice, honey,
it a-always feels like this.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.176
OBAMA:
And as we do, rest assured

41:09.217 --> 41:12.053
that the Iranian government
will know our resolve.

41:12.095 --> 41:14.097
(applause on TV)

41:16.099 --> 41:18.101
(door closes)

41:23.899 --> 41:28.153
You still have
that little "Boy Wonder" guy?

41:28.195 --> 41:30.155
What are you talking about?

41:30.197 --> 41:32.616
Your little Robin.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.160
-The normal guy who wants...
-Dennis.

41:35.202 --> 41:38.163
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

41:38.205 --> 41:40.373
Get him here.

41:40.415 --> 41:41.917
You want me to get him involved?

41:41.958 --> 41:44.336
He's already involved.

41:44.377 --> 41:45.587
Birdbath.

41:45.629 --> 41:48.423
He knows, too.

41:48.465 --> 41:50.467
I should tell you everything.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.093
Of course he does.

41:52.135 --> 41:55.138
-Oh.
-What?

41:55.180 --> 41:57.599
-And Mom.
-Your mother?

41:57.641 --> 41:58.892
Yeah.

41:58.934 --> 42:00.936
-Your mother knows?
-Yeah.

42:00.977 --> 42:03.563
-How?
-I called her.

42:03.605 --> 42:07.442
I don't know why. Tonight.

42:07.484 --> 42:09.694
-She's coming.
-Coming where?

42:09.736 --> 42:12.489
Here.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.991
Your mother's coming here?

42:15.033 --> 42:17.452
Yeah.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.833
(chuckling):
Fuck.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.461
You have to keep this together.

42:26.503 --> 42:30.006
You're s-starting
to get out of control, son.

42:30.048 --> 42:33.343
If you can't keep
this thing together,

42:33.385 --> 42:39.057
and get her back to us, soon,
with that bag...

42:41.393 --> 42:46.106
You're going to get this
over with right away.

42:46.147 --> 42:49.651
If you can't keep a hold on
things with your wife here,

42:49.693 --> 42:55.031
and-and the kid,
uh, dog-- Jesus.

42:55.073 --> 42:59.744
Your mother.
Half the company knows.

42:59.786 --> 43:02.247
That's what you'll have to do
if you can't get the money

43:02.289 --> 43:07.168
back from her
in the next few days.

43:07.210 --> 43:12.799
If you can't keep this
in control...

43:12.841 --> 43:17.429
You're just going
to get it over with.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.472
Well, how?

43:24.811 --> 43:27.814
You're going to kill him.

43:36.239 --> 43:39.117
I just can't believe it.

43:39.159 --> 43:41.745
Can't believe what?

43:41.786 --> 43:43.830
Glassblower.

43:43.872 --> 43:44.873
Puppeteer.

43:44.914 --> 43:46.583
Yeah, whatever.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.959
She didn't want the money?

43:48.001 --> 43:49.544
No.

43:49.586 --> 43:51.504
She just wanted the bag?

43:51.546 --> 43:54.591
-Yeah.
-(laughing): I just...

43:54.632 --> 43:57.218
I just don't believe it.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.804
Yeah, well,
that's what happened.

43:59.846 --> 44:03.933
N-Nobody would do that.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.935
Who would do that?
Nobody would.

44:05.977 --> 44:10.106
I know somebody who would.

44:10.148 --> 44:12.776
But she just left.

44:16.029 --> 44:18.031
(sighs)

44:20.492 --> 44:22.702
I knew I should have
asked her for the keys.

44:22.744 --> 44:26.498
I didn't want
to hurt her feelings.

44:30.585 --> 44:34.464
Well, it's just you and me, kid.

44:34.506 --> 44:36.966
And a dog.

44:37.008 --> 44:38.593
He won't leave.

44:38.635 --> 44:40.678
Good boy.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.806
Yeah, I don't know.

44:42.847 --> 44:45.266
I think he's just been trained.

44:51.314 --> 44:53.316
Hmm.

44:56.986 --> 44:59.114
TOM:
He's coming to Paris.

44:59.155 --> 45:01.116
Tomorrow.

45:01.157 --> 45:03.159
For the OPEC summit.

45:05.620 --> 45:08.081
He has a compound in Paris.

45:08.123 --> 45:09.833
JOHN:
Sounds janky.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.836
TOM:
What's that?

45:12.877 --> 45:14.170
JOHN:
Janky.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.882
Killing a guy
in a compound by myself.

45:17.924 --> 45:20.969
Sounds janky.

45:21.010 --> 45:24.097
What's the success rate
of that, you think?

45:24.139 --> 45:26.975
TOM:
Uh, I don't know.

45:27.016 --> 45:30.270
Five percent?

45:30.311 --> 45:32.689
I don't know.

45:32.730 --> 45:36.359
JOHN:
That plan's on the other side.

45:36.401 --> 45:37.777
TOM:
Of what?

45:37.819 --> 45:40.697
JOHN:
Of the Vantasner.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.991
TOM:
The Vantasner Danger Meridian?

45:43.032 --> 45:45.034
JOHN:
Yeah.

45:47.162 --> 45:50.373
TOM: Well, you're gonna start
figuring out how to do it.

45:50.415 --> 45:52.500
You start tomorrow.

45:52.542 --> 45:54.169
JOHN:
Doing what?

45:54.210 --> 45:57.338
TOM:
There are 19,000 guns in Paris.

45:59.299 --> 46:00.925
Get one.
