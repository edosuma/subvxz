00:10.010 --> 00:12.263
(GASPS) Jorge,
there's a snake
on your foot.

00:12.263 --> 00:13.264
What?

00:15.136 --> 00:17.098
Sometimes,
it's just too easy.

00:18.599 --> 00:20.271
Where's Lou
with the mail?

00:20.271 --> 00:21.812
Why do you
want the mail?

00:21.812 --> 00:24.235
Every week, you get
the same postcard
from your mother

00:24.235 --> 00:27.858
that says,
"Don't disappoint me."

00:27.858 --> 00:32.413
We're expecting a package
from the world famous horror
novelist Stephanie Queen.

00:32.413 --> 00:35.326
Why is a famous author
sending you two stuff?

00:35.326 --> 00:37.788
I'd guess you're starting
a book club, but you know...

00:37.788 --> 00:40.371
Jorge.

00:40.371 --> 00:44.925
Actually, we both
entered her annual
scary short story contest.

00:44.925 --> 00:48.008
My story was called,
Labyrinth of the Mind:

00:48.008 --> 00:51.632
One Girl's Terrifying Journey
into the Madness of Her Soul.

00:51.632 --> 00:54.265
Well, that would win for
"Most Boring Title Ever."

00:55.766 --> 00:58.229
What was yours called
Fart of Darkness?

00:59.730 --> 01:02.773
No, it was called
Blood Bags!

01:02.773 --> 01:05.776
And it was about
bags of blood.

01:05.776 --> 01:07.238
Jorge! Tiffany!
Guess what?

01:07.238 --> 01:09.570
You got a package
from Stephanie Queen!

01:09.570 --> 01:13.364
I loved her book,
The Crowded Coffin.
JORGE: Me too!

01:13.364 --> 01:16.657
It proved you could fit
20 bodies in one coffin,

01:16.657 --> 01:18.329
if you cut them up
the right way.

01:20.201 --> 01:22.963
Anyway, the winner gets
to bring three friends

01:22.963 --> 01:25.546
to meet Stephanie Queen
at her summer cabin.

01:25.546 --> 01:26.797

the package!

This is for Tiffany.

01:30.301 --> 01:32.713

to some professional writer
who sent in their story.

that bird joke book.

it was eggs-cellent.

not even in the book.

03:11.111 --> 03:12.483

03:14.074 --> 03:15.486
Oy.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.488
I think the birdhouse
should face the lake.

That way, after
a long day of flying,

03:19.119 --> 03:21.492

03:21.492 --> 03:23.163

03:23.163 --> 03:26.166

birdhouses facing east
hatch more young.

a terrible sound

when they hit the windows
of our penthouse.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.725

03:44.725 --> 03:46.347
By the time you're done,

03:46.347 --> 03:48.849

Well, let's each
make our case,

03:59.360 --> 04:01.662
and let Xander
decide which way
the birdhouse should go.

04:01.662 --> 04:04.575
No way. Xander is
your boyfriend.

04:04.575 --> 04:07.868

it's awesome.

at the "spot" tonight.

Xander, bro,
tell her I am right.

tell him I'm right.

I hear what both
of you are saying.

And my decision is...

06:59.590 --> 07:01.171

you didn't think of it.

was bone-chilling.

dead moose is being rude,
you can just take it down.

No, I can't.
He owns the house.

her well-water checked.

marked "Top Secret"?

the rest of that moose.

Oh, nothing.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.740
Just what I'm working on
for my new book,

08:09.740 --> 08:12.703

the opinion of some,

08:12.703 --> 08:15.415
is going to be

I won't tell anyone.

I've earned a solid

Good for you.

Follow me to the basement.

into the basement
of a crazy woman

with clever ideas
to murder people.

go wrong?

This is gonna be

Don't worry, my lips
are sealed tighter
than that time

08:54.615 --> 08:56.707
I fell face first
into a sewing machine!

08:59.580 --> 09:05.626
Wow!
Please, look around.
I decorated it myself.

09:05.626 --> 09:10.090
It is not tacky.
It's eclectic!

09:10.090 --> 09:13.343

Hey, I had a pet bird
just like this
when I was young.

09:17.097 --> 09:19.730

09:43.043 --> 09:46.917
I have a feeling
it's not as cute
as it sounds.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.419
If you want to
get out of there,
you'll have to solve riddles

09:49.419 --> 09:52.132
based on your knowledge
of my books.

09:52.132 --> 09:54.554
So, picture this...

09:54.554 --> 09:56.977
A right answer
gets you another clue.

09:56.977 --> 09:58.558
A wrong answer

09:58.558 --> 10:00.851
gets you stuffed
and put on my wall.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.893
What?
Why would
you do this?

10:02.893 --> 10:04.725
Because she's crazy!

10:05.686 --> 10:07.607

10:08.729 --> 10:10.190
What are we going to do?

10:10.190 --> 10:13.864
Don't worry, guys.
I'm trained for any
and all situations.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.155
Except this one.

10:18.739 --> 10:20.240
I'm too young to die!

10:20.240 --> 10:22.833
Me, too! I've never
performed at Carnegie Hall!

10:22.833 --> 10:24.584
And I've never...

10:24.584 --> 10:26.006
I mean,
I've never even...

10:27.297 --> 10:30.250
Huh, I've done everything.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.632
Forget too young,
I'm too cool to die!

10:33.924 --> 10:37.017
Nobody is going to die!
We just need to find
our first clue.

10:37.017 --> 10:39.099
Wait, remember what
Ms. Queen said?

10:39.099 --> 10:40.971
That I was a better
writer than you?

10:42.102 --> 10:43.894
Congratulations, Jorge.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.977
The crazy woman
who's torturing us
thinks you're a good writer.

10:48.899 --> 10:52.192
I meant, she emphasized
the word "picture,"
so that must be a clue.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.485
Maybe it's that picture!

10:55.485 --> 10:57.617
He kinda looks like
my weird Uncle Virgil.

10:57.617 --> 11:02.412
He was a Merchant Marine
who did time for
lima bean smuggling.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.665
I don't know
what's scarier,
this room or Lou's family.

11:07.087 --> 11:08.999
Maybe there's something
behind the picture!

11:10.841 --> 11:11.752
Tiffany, no!

11:16.056 --> 11:18.969
Jorge, you saved my life!

11:18.969 --> 11:20.761
Yep, now you owe me.

11:20.761 --> 11:23.183
I'll take my thank you
in kisses.

11:25.395 --> 11:27.808
I'd rather have
an anchor sticking
out of my skull.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.862
Jorge, how did you
know that anchor
was going to fall?

11:31.862 --> 11:35.075
Because that's a picture
of Admiral Smith,

11:35.075 --> 11:39.820
who used an anchor to
kill his nosey first mate
in the book  Murder Boat.

11:39.820 --> 11:43.323
How do you remember that?
Yesterday, you forgot to
put on pants for lunch.

11:44.915 --> 11:48.538
And Admiral Smith loved
to leave hidden clues.

11:48.538 --> 11:51.131
Wait, I think
I see something
on the frame!

11:51.131 --> 11:53.093
It says...

11:53.093 --> 11:57.387
"Made in China."
What do you think
that means?

11:57.387 --> 12:00.260
That you're not going
to be much help
solving these riddles.

12:01.681 --> 12:03.643
Hey, there's something
written on the scroll.

12:04.895 --> 12:08.939
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

12:08.939 --> 12:11.191
The writing is backwards.
Look in the mirror!

12:12.692 --> 12:15.525
"Until I am measured,
I am not known.

12:15.525 --> 12:17.948
"Yet how you miss me
when I have flown."

12:19.950 --> 12:21.912
Oh, the answer is time.

12:21.912 --> 12:25.125
So our next clue must be
in that clock on the wall.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.958
And now it's time
to go home.

12:27.958 --> 12:29.830
No! The clock
is a trap, too!

12:34.294 --> 12:36.426
Look! The clue
is in the dart!

12:38.008 --> 12:40.971
Wow, all these traps
are very elaborate.

12:40.971 --> 12:43.804
I know. When does
this woman find
time to write?

12:46.847 --> 12:47.938
(MOANS)

12:49.479 --> 12:52.352
Oh, let me guess.
You think I'm hanging
this net up wrong,

12:52.352 --> 12:53.984
and you're gonna tell me
a better way to do it.

12:53.984 --> 12:57.357
Of course not. I will
just come back later
and fix your work.

12:57.357 --> 12:58.398
Per uzsh.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.661
I am sick of fighting.

13:01.661 --> 13:04.204
So let's just not talk
to each other for
the rest of the summer.

13:04.204 --> 13:06.616
Finally, you have
a good idea!

13:06.616 --> 13:07.747
See you in New York!

13:09.249 --> 13:10.500
Ravi, we're still
at the same camp.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.832
You're going to
see me at dinner.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.834
Well, that is not
as dramatic, is it?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.877
Sorry to interrupt
your bickering,

13:16.877 --> 13:19.419
but Lou and the kids
still haven't come back
from Stephanie Queen's.

13:19.419 --> 13:22.012
Should we be worried?
Yes! We should
go look for them.

13:22.012 --> 13:25.225
Okay, but I'm not going
to listen to any more
of your stupid fighting.

13:25.225 --> 13:27.187
Message received, Xander.

13:27.187 --> 13:30.060
Emma and I will stop
putting you in the middle
of our family squabbles.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.772
No, I mean, I'm not
going to listen to it.

13:34.985 --> 13:37.197
(SPEAKING LOUDLY)
Tap me on the shoulder if
you hear the kids screaming.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.653
(BEEPING)
Howdy-do, victims.

13:43.653 --> 13:46.947
Uh, you might want to
zoom out a bit, Ms. Queen.

13:46.947 --> 13:49.039
Yeah, and grab
a tissue.

13:49.039 --> 13:50.911
You got some bats
in the cave.

13:53.003 --> 13:55.045
There!

13:55.045 --> 14:00.550
Not bad so far,
but the puzzles are
going to get harder.

14:00.550 --> 14:03.223
And your lives are going
to get shorter.

14:03.223 --> 14:07.057
Now, what do you think
of this?

14:07.057 --> 14:08.728
(CHUCKLING)

14:11.101 --> 14:17.187
Uh... I think you're
fooling yourself if you
think you can pass for 22.

14:17.187 --> 14:20.110
It also says
she's great with kids.
That thing is full of lies.

14:21.821 --> 14:24.154
Oh, sorry!
Wrong button.
(CLEARS THROAT)

14:24.154 --> 14:25.825
What I meant was,

14:25.825 --> 14:30.120
it seems your camp friends
have come looking for you.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.162
TIFFANY: Look!
They came to rescue us!

14:32.162 --> 14:35.705
Too bad they'll
never find you!
(LAUGHING)

14:37.547 --> 14:39.089
(KNOCKING)

14:40.460 --> 14:43.053
What a fine-looking
bunch of young people.

14:43.053 --> 14:44.424
Aw, why, thank you.

14:44.424 --> 14:47.217
I feel like I have
really started to
grow into my face.

14:48.848 --> 14:50.180
We're looking for
our friends.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.391
They came here
to have lunch with you.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.143
Ah, yes!

14:53.143 --> 14:55.475
They were here,
but they left
just after eating.

14:55.475 --> 14:57.277
Good day!
Oh, uh...

14:57.277 --> 14:59.519
You know, Ms. Queen,
I, too, have written a book.

14:59.519 --> 15:02.022
My protagonist
is Dr. Ravi Ross,

15:02.022 --> 15:05.155
part-time crime solver,
full-time ladies' man.

15:06.286 --> 15:07.577
Obviously fiction.

15:09.579 --> 15:11.161
This is why I don't
do book signings.

15:12.702 --> 15:15.165
ALL: (SHOUTING) Help!

15:15.165 --> 15:16.916
They can't hear us.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.299
Maybe if we bang on something,
they'll feel the vibrations!

15:19.299 --> 15:20.840
Great idea, Lou!

15:20.840 --> 15:24.254
The two hardest things
in here are the anchor
and Jorge's head.

15:24.254 --> 15:26.967
I'll start smashing
them together.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.179
Wouldn't banging
on the ceiling with
the cane work, too?

15:29.179 --> 15:31.051
Sure. It just wouldn't
be as much fun.

15:33.353 --> 15:35.976
(ALL SCREAMING)

15:35.976 --> 15:38.438
Thanks for stopping by.
Good luck with your book.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.190
Oh, may I send
you a copy...
No.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.191
It sounds dreadful.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.652
Wait...

15:42.652 --> 15:44.864
What was that?
A noise.

15:44.864 --> 15:46.446
Bye.
Wait!

15:46.446 --> 15:48.158
(BANGING)

15:48.158 --> 15:49.949
Those plates are full.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.412
I thought you said
our friends left
after lunch.

15:52.412 --> 15:56.076
They filled up
on bread sticks.

15:56.076 --> 15:57.497
Do you mind
if we come in
and look around?

15:57.497 --> 15:59.839
I guess. But don't
step on the carpet.

15:59.839 --> 16:01.251
He's cranky today.

16:09.299 --> 16:11.761
Nice moose.

16:11.761 --> 16:13.303
Not when you
get to know him.

16:13.303 --> 16:15.225
(BANGING CONTINUES)

16:15.225 --> 16:17.357
Ms. Queen, have you got
our friends trapped in here?

16:17.357 --> 16:18.978
Absolutely not.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.940
You haven't see any
trapped children, have you?

16:22.862 --> 16:25.105
Don't listen to him.
He's cuckoo.
(MIMICS CUCKOO)

16:25.105 --> 16:27.607

The noise is coming
from the basement!

16:27.607 --> 16:28.778
They must be
down there!

16:33.243 --> 16:35.785
No.

I keep my deadly
fungus collection.

Emma, you are not
going to find a clue
in the mirror!

17:15.285 --> 17:16.286
I know.

17:17.657 --> 17:20.330
Guys, you said
there were clues
in the book titles!

17:20.330 --> 17:22.001
What are some other
Stephanie Queen books?

17:22.001 --> 17:24.294
Let's see, there's
Kissed by a Chainsaw,

There's a skeleton
over there!

17:27.467 --> 17:29.259
Maybe there's
a clue in here!

17:29.259 --> 17:30.800
I hope so,
or pretty soon

17:30.800 --> 17:33.303
we're all gonna
look like that.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.805
Actually, based on
the moisture level
in the room,

17:35.805 --> 17:38.268
our decomposition
will probably take
closer to a year.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.022
Where's a falling anchor
when you need one?

17:44.354 --> 17:46.776

actually get out of here
without dying!

the only thing between me
and death is Jorge's brain.

impressed with your progress,

17:56.866 --> 17:59.289
as you can tell
by the look on my face.

Ms. Queen,
we can't see your face.

my grandma!

18:12.172 --> 18:16.426
Guess right, and you get
the code to the keypad...
And your freedom.

fellow campers will be telling
ghost stories about you.

It's a telephone!

They have a ring,
and they used to be
plugged into the wall,

18:38.238 --> 18:40.079
but now you carry
them everywhere!

18:40.079 --> 18:42.872
Right! And in the book
"Ring, Ring, You're Dead,"

18:42.872 --> 18:45.955
if you got a call
from a certain number,
you would die.

18:45.955 --> 18:47.747
So, the number
must be the code!

22:11.621 --> 22:14.454
into the middle of your stupid
fight over a stupid birdhouse!

22:18.798 --> 22:21.671
Actually, we are not
fighting anymore.

22:21.671 --> 22:23.463
Yeah, we came
to a compromise.

22:24.303 --> 22:26.055
Oh...
(SQUIRTING)

22:29.929 --> 22:31.391
I see you went with the bidet.
