WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:04.205
GEORGE, HEY, FOUND THIS
BOX OF JUNK IN THE CLOSET.

00:04.205 --> 00:06.006
YOU WANT ME TO THROW IT OUT?

00:06.006 --> 00:08.609
SLOW DOWN. THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN HERE.

00:08.609 --> 00:12.980
"ANGIE'S SPECIAL MEMORIES."
NAH, IT'S JUST JUNK.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.648
(Angie) LET ME SEE THAT.

00:14.648 --> 00:15.816
COME ON, ANGIE.

00:15.816 --> 00:18.086
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE
WORTH KEEPING.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.953
LOOK, JUST A BUNCH
OF DEAD FLOWERS.

00:19.953 --> 00:23.023
THAT WAS MY WEDDING BOUQUET.

00:26.194 --> 00:29.797
AND IT'S JUST AS BEAUTIFUL
WITH COFFEE GROUNDS ON IT.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.702
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.904
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THESE
FOR YEARS.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.406
GEORGE, THESE ARE THE LETTERS

00:38.406 --> 00:40.674
THE PRIEST ASKED US
TO WRITE TO EACH OTHER

00:40.674 --> 00:42.710
AS PART OF
OUR PRE-MARITAL COUNSELING.

00:42.710 --> 00:43.777
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS
WENT TO COUNSELING

00:43.777 --> 00:45.379
BEFORE YOU GOT MARRIED.

00:45.379 --> 00:49.617
WHAT, DID YOU HAVE PROBLEMS,
DOUBTS, ISSUES, FANTASY LOVERS?

00:51.152 --> 00:54.288
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
EVERY TIME I WAS WITH HER,

00:54.288 --> 00:56.690
I KEPT THINKIN' ABOUT YOU.

00:58.459 --> 01:01.829
COUNSELING IS SOMETHING
YOU HAVE TO DO

01:01.829 --> 01:04.665
TO GET MARRIED
IN THE CHURCH.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.501
GEORGE, DO YOU REALIZE
INSIDE THESE LETTERS

01:07.501 --> 01:09.237
IS HOW WE FELT
ABOUT EACH OTHER

01:09.237 --> 01:11.572
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED?

01:11.572 --> 01:15.042
OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO OPEN THEM
AND SEE HOW OUR LOVE HAS GROWN.

01:15.042 --> 01:18.279
OR DRIED UP AND DIED.

01:19.780 --> 01:23.417
I'M GONNA OPEN THIS LETTER,
BECAUSE I COULD USE A LAUGH.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.253
NO! THESE ARE PRIVATE.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.189
I HAVEN'T READ ANGIE'S,
AND SHE HASN'T READ MINE.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.790
GEORGE, WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO OPEN THESE

01:29.790 --> 01:32.860
ON OUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY,
BUT WE COULDN'T FIND THEM.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.663
WHY DON'T WE OPEN THEM
THIS ANNIVERSARY?

01:35.663 --> 01:37.598
'CAUSE IT'S COMING UP,
YOU KNOW.

01:37.598 --> 01:41.535
YEAH, I KNOW
IT'S COMIN' UP...

01:41.535 --> 01:44.638
IN THREE DAYS.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.611
FOUR DAYS.
WOW, ALREADY?

01:50.611 --> 01:53.881
FIVE DAYS?

01:53.881 --> 01:56.817
TWO DAYS. WOW.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.952
THREE DAYS.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.822
OHH!

02:01.822 --> 02:03.891
THAT'S NOT FAIR!
I HAD IT!

02:03.891 --> 02:06.560
I'M GOING TO KEEP THESE
SO YOU DON'T PEEK.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.364
WE CAN OPEN THE LETTERS
ON SATURDAY.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.966
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR WHAT YOU WROTE

02:12.966 --> 02:14.835
WHEN YOU WERE 19 YEARS OLD.

02:14.835 --> 02:19.373
HEY, WHY DON'T WE MAKE THIS
A DRINKING GAME?

02:19.373 --> 02:21.842
WE'LL DO A SHOT
EVERY SINGLE TIME

02:21.842 --> 02:25.145
GEORGE USED THE WORD "DUDE."

02:26.214 --> 02:29.717
"DUDE, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,
DUDE."

02:29.717 --> 02:32.853
"DUDE, YOU TOTALLY ROCK,
DUDE."

02:32.853 --> 02:34.655
"I'M SO SERIOUS, DUDE."

02:34.655 --> 02:38.459
GOOD NIGHT, DUDE,
I'M GOIN' UP NOW, DUDE.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.896
HEY, I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS

02:42.896 --> 02:45.266
FOR YOU TO FIND ME
ANNIVERSARY GIFTS,

02:45.266 --> 02:48.902
SO THIS YEAR,
WHY DON'T WE SKIP ALL THAT

02:48.902 --> 02:51.505
AND JUST READ THE LETTERS
TO EACH OTHER?

02:51.505 --> 02:55.643
BUT I WANTED TO BUY YOU
SOMETHING REALLY EXPENSIVE.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.447
LIKE THAT THING YOU ALWAYS
SAID YOU WANT,

02:59.447 --> 03:01.815
BUT I ALWAYS PRETEND
TO FORGET WHAT IT IS.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.885
WHAT IS IT AGAIN,
AND WHERE DO THEY SELL IT?

03:04.885 --> 03:08.822
NOTHING WE BUY COULD EVER
BE AS ROMANTIC

03:08.822 --> 03:12.526
AS WHAT WE WROTE
TO EACH OTHER.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.829
I REALLY POURED MY SOUL
INTO MY LETTER.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.931
I CAN'T WAIT TO READ
WHAT YOU WROTE.

03:20.534 --> 03:25.205
NO ANNIVERSARY PRESENT
COULD EVER MATCH IT.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.450
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU WROTE?

03:36.450 --> 03:41.522
I THINK I SAID I WANTED
TO BEND HER LIKE A PRETZEL.

03:41.522 --> 03:46.460
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

03:48.128 --> 03:50.197
* ALL MY FRIENDS

03:50.197 --> 03:52.733
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

03:55.168 --> 03:56.937
* THE LOW RIDER

03:56.937 --> 03:59.940
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

04:12.019 --> 04:14.822
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

04:14.822 --> 04:17.458
OH, UH, WE'RE PUTTING
A CEILING FAN IN THE BEDROOM.

04:17.458 --> 04:22.496
I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR A FAN
IN THE BEDROOM FOR 15 YEARS.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.333
AND YOU'VE HAD ONE, BABY!

04:25.333 --> 04:27.601
BRAVO!
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!

04:27.601 --> 04:30.771
JUST REMEMBER,
IT'S NOT A RACE.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.045
SO WHERE ARE THE LETTERS?

04:42.650 --> 04:44.084
GOT 'EM.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.253
I WANNA READ
WHAT I WROTE.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.255
MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
WE'RE WORKING.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.924
(screeches and kicks wall)

04:53.861 --> 04:56.263
USE THE SAW, FOOL!

04:56.263 --> 04:58.932
(saw buzzes)

05:06.640 --> 05:09.377
OH, MAN,
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT THIS.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.078
WHY? WHAT'D YOU WRITE?

05:11.078 --> 05:16.650
"SORRY I COUGHED IN YOUR EAR,
BUT YOUR BUTT IS SMOKIN'."

05:16.650 --> 05:18.652
HEY, THAT'S FROM WHEN
WE HAD OUR GARAGE BAND.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.221
THAT'S THE LYRICS TO A SONG
WE NEVER FINISHED.

05:21.221 --> 05:24.592
"THREE ALARM BUTT FIRE."

05:24.592 --> 05:26.894
"YOUR SEAT'S IN HEAT,
AND I'M NO LIAR.

05:26.894 --> 05:32.466
"I WANNA STOP, DROP AND ROLL
'CAUSE YOUR BUTT'S ON FIRE!"

05:32.466 --> 05:33.734
GIMME A MINUTE.
I GOTTA REWRITE THIS.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.335
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.004
WELL,
SOMETHING ROMANTIC.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.541
SOMETHING FROM WAY DOWN DEEP,
HOW I REALLY FEEL ABOUT ANGIE.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.415
YOU GOT ANYTHING?

05:47.415 --> 05:52.786
YOU ARE UNSPOILED PERFECTION.

05:52.786 --> 05:56.457
YOUR SMILE, YOUR HEART,
YOUR SOUL.

05:56.457 --> 05:59.393
WHOA. SLOW DOWN.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.562
YOU'RE AN AMAZING WIFE,

06:01.562 --> 06:04.064
A FRIEND AND MOTHER
TO MY CHILDREN.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.534
I DON'T DESERVE YOU.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.737
I REALLY, REALLY
DON'T DESERVE YOU.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.174
MAKE SOME MORE NOISE.
I WANNA READ WHAT ANGIE WROTE.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.275
OH, ALL RIGHT.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.677
(saw buzzes)

06:26.086 --> 06:27.755
WHAT? WHAT'S IT SAY?

06:27.755 --> 06:30.524
"SINCE YOU'RE READING THIS,
YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT I DID

06:30.524 --> 06:33.293
"AND YOU FOUND A WAY
TO FORGIVE ME.

06:33.293 --> 06:36.697
"I'M ASHAMED I EVER HID IT
FROM YOU. I'M SORRY.

06:36.697 --> 06:40.167
"I LOVE YOU, ANGIE."

06:40.167 --> 06:41.569
OH, MY GOD.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.538
WHAT DOES "IT" MEAN, GEORGE?

06:44.538 --> 06:47.708
Ã³RALE, 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN!

06:50.277 --> 06:54.381
WHAT ELSE COULD "IT" MEAN?!
SHE CHEATED ON ME!

06:54.381 --> 06:56.216
(Angie) HEY, HONEY?

06:56.216 --> 06:58.018
HOW'S THE FAN COMING ALONG?!

06:58.018 --> 07:00.287
I'LL TELL YOU HOW
IT'S COMIN' ALONG, CHICA!

07:00.287 --> 07:03.423
(saw buzzes)

07:06.326 --> 07:08.395
AND YOU CAN HAVE THE KIDS,
BECAUSE I DON'T CARE!

07:08.395 --> 07:11.599
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED 'EM!
YOU FORCED YOURSELF ON ME!

07:11.599 --> 07:13.200
(Angie) BE PATIENT, HONEY!

07:13.200 --> 07:15.636
I KNOW HOW YOU GET WHEN YOU TRY
TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.370
YEAH, WELL, I JUST PUT
TWO AND TWO--

07:17.370 --> 07:21.542
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T!
CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

07:21.542 --> 07:24.712
ANGIE WOULD NEVER
CHEAT ON YOU.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.380
YEAH, LOOK AT HER
AND LOOK AT ME!

07:27.380 --> 07:28.682
WHAT DO YOU THINK?!

07:28.682 --> 07:31.184
OKAY, GIVE HER A CHANCE
TO EXPLAIN HERSELF

07:31.184 --> 07:33.420
WHEN YOU OPEN THE LETTER.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.022
SHE'S WAY TOO SMART
FOR THAT.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.691
I CAN'T GIVE HER TIME
TO COME UP WITH A GOOD STORY.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.292
I GOTTA PRETEND
LIKE WE'RE TALKING.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.630
I'LL BE LIKE, "OH, YEAH, REALLY?
WOW. HOW IRONIC."

07:44.331 --> 07:48.135
WHAT I'LL REALLY BE DOING
IS PERPLEXING HER THOUGHTS--

07:48.135 --> 07:50.538
SYMPOSIUMS.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.543
SHE'LL BE PUTTY
IN MY MIND.

07:55.543 --> 07:58.478
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:00.413 --> 08:03.817
THANK YOU, AND THAT'S JUST
A LITTLE TASTE, MY FRIEND.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.791
(door opens)

08:12.225 --> 08:15.863
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, HONEY.

08:16.864 --> 08:17.965
OHH...

08:17.965 --> 08:20.200
LISTEN, ANGIE,
BEFORE WE OPEN THE LETTERS,

08:20.200 --> 08:21.935
I HAVE ANOTHER GIFT
I WANT TO GIVE YOU,

08:21.935 --> 08:25.773
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.107
I PROMISE
YOU'RE GONNA GET LUCKY,

08:27.107 --> 08:30.944
BUT FOR ONCE,
CAN'T WE JUST EAT FIRST?

08:30.944 --> 08:32.646
NOT THAT!

08:32.646 --> 08:34.214
LOOK, I WAS THINKING
THE MOST WONDERFUL GIFT

08:34.214 --> 08:37.284
WE COULD GIVE EACH OTHER
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY

08:37.284 --> 08:38.986
IS COMPLETE HONESTY.

08:38.986 --> 08:42.222
OKAY, SO, I WANT US
TO TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING

08:42.222 --> 08:43.691
AND CLEAN THE SLATE.

08:43.691 --> 08:46.960
I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS
FOR YEARS. WHY NOW?

08:46.960 --> 08:50.197
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S PERPLEXING, ISN'T IT?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.467
THANK YOU.

08:54.467 --> 08:59.139
UH, SO WE'LL BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH EACH OTHER?

08:59.139 --> 09:02.109
YES, AND NO MATTER HOW BIG
A SECRET WE REVEAL,

09:02.109 --> 09:03.977
WE WON'T GET MAD
AT EACH OTHER, OKAY?

09:03.977 --> 09:06.980
WE'LL HAVE TOTAL AMNESTY
FOR TOTAL HONESTY.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.183
THAT'S THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.285
OKAY, I'LL GO FIRST.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.155
I STOLE THESE FLOWERS
FROM THE CEMETERY.

09:21.829 --> 09:26.566
YOU SEE, I FEEL SO MUCH
CLOSER TO YOU...

09:26.566 --> 09:29.502
AND EDNA JOHNSON,
BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER.

09:29.502 --> 09:30.537
YOUR TURN.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.606
UM...

09:32.606 --> 09:35.142
WHENEVER I RUN OUT OF MINUTES
ON MY PHONE,

09:35.142 --> 09:39.680
I USE YOUR PHONE SO IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU'RE THE ONE GOING OVER.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.316
AND I NAG YOU ABOUT IT.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.787
OKAY, FELT A LITTLE CLOSER.
LET'S GO DEEPER.

09:46.787 --> 09:47.988
WHEN YOU DANCE
AT PARTIES,

09:47.988 --> 09:50.357
YOU EMBARRASS ME
AND YOUR PEOPLE.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.564
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:57.564 --> 09:59.166
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT...

10:02.469 --> 10:05.706
AND THAT'S AT WEDDINGS
WHERE KIDS ARE WATCHING.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.207
OKAY.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.810
THAT HURTS A LITTLE BIT,
BUT OKAY.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.511
I CAN TAKE IT.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.047
ALL RIGHT, IT'S YOUR TURN,
ALL RIGHT? DON'T HOLD BACK.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.851
I KNOW YOU DO PUSH-UPS
IN THE BATHROOM BEFORE SEX,

10:17.851 --> 10:20.988
BUT IT JUST MAKES YOU
SWEATY AND TIRED.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.594
I TRIED TO HAVE YOUR FATHER
DEPORTED.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.196
WHAT?!

10:29.196 --> 10:31.464
HE CALLED ME A LOSER.
I MADE A PHONE CALL. YOUR TURN.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.966
COME ON, KEEP 'EM COMIN'!

10:32.966 --> 10:34.201
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE!

10:34.201 --> 10:37.204
NOT BIGGER THAN
DEPORTING MY DAD!

10:37.204 --> 10:38.906
NOTHING OVER
OUR WHOLE MARRIAGE?

10:38.906 --> 10:40.273
NO!

10:40.273 --> 10:42.175
NOT EVEN, LIKE...

10:42.175 --> 10:44.377
A BETRAYAL FROM BEFORE
WE WERE MARRIED?

10:44.377 --> 10:45.412
I WON'T GET MAD.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.914
WELL...

10:46.914 --> 10:47.848
AHA!

10:52.786 --> 10:57.057
I'M SORRY I SCARED YOU.
REMEMBER, TOTAL AMNESTY.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.960
WELL, IT HAPPENED SO LONG AGO.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.095
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH
TALKING ABOUT.

11:02.095 --> 11:06.599
OH, COME ON, ANGIE.
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.970
ALL RIGHT.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.108
MY DAD PUT $20,000
IN A BANK ACCOUNT

11:15.108 --> 11:17.644
IN CASE I EVER WANTED
TO LEAVE YOU.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.013
WHAT?!
LEAVE ME FOR WHO?!

11:20.013 --> 11:22.682
YOUR LOVER?!
HOW DOES HE TOUCH YOU, HUH?!

11:22.682 --> 11:24.684
DOES HE TALK?
DOES HE CUDDLE?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.855
BECAUSE WHATEVER IT IS,
HE'S GAY.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.324
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:31.324 --> 11:32.960
I NEVER HAD A LOVER.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.996
MY DAD THOUGHT OUR MARRIAGE
WAS A MISTAKE,

11:35.996 --> 11:38.231
AND HE WANTED ME TO HAVE
THE MONEY

11:38.231 --> 11:39.900
JUST IN CASE
I CAME TO MY SENSES.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.369
AND I NEVER DID, HONEY.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.810
SO YOU NEVER CHEATED ON ME?
IT WAS JUST AN ACCOUNT?

11:49.810 --> 11:53.046
YES. I'M SORRY I NEVER
TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.649
IT WAS JUST SO LONG AGO.
I FORGOT ABOUT IT MYSELF.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.052
(chuckles)

11:59.052 --> 12:01.254
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.656
SO HOW LONG
AFTER WE WERE MARRIED

12:03.656 --> 12:05.458
DID YOU CLOSE THE ACCOUNT?

12:05.458 --> 12:08.661
UH...

12:08.661 --> 12:11.131
LET ME MAKE A CALL.

12:14.634 --> 12:17.537
THE ACCOUNT IS STILL OPEN?!

12:17.537 --> 12:19.272
GEORGE, DON'T OVERREACT.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.274
WAIT A MINUTE, SO THE WHOLE TIME
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED,

12:21.274 --> 12:23.276
YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS
A CHANCE WE WOULDN'T MAKE IT.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.713
I HAVEN'T TOUCHED
THAT PASSBOOK IN YEARS.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.648
YOU HAVE A PASSBOOK?
WHERE IS IT?

12:28.648 --> 12:31.518
I DON'T REMEMBER!

12:31.518 --> 12:33.353
YOU'RE HIDING IT.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.756
WHERE'S THE LAST PLACE
I WOULD EVER LOOK?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.626
THE KIDS' BABY PICTURES.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.930
'CAUSE WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE,
THEY LOOKED LIKE MARTIANS.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.966
IT'S NOT IN THERE.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.003
WHERE ELSE
WOULD I NEVER LOOK?

12:50.003 --> 12:54.007
"INTIMACY
THROUGH COMMUNICATION."

12:54.007 --> 12:56.443
JUST TOUCHIN' IT
BURNS MY FINGERS!

12:58.545 --> 13:01.048
AHA.
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

13:01.048 --> 13:03.483
JUST GIVE ME THE PASSBOOK.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.586
I'LL RIP IT UP AND WE'LL FORGET
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING.

13:06.586 --> 13:07.888
WHAT'S THIS?

13:07.888 --> 13:09.890
YOU TOOK THE MONEY OUT
IN '93.

13:09.890 --> 13:13.793
BUT I PUT IT ALL BACK
THE NEXT DAY.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.596
THE NEXT DAY?

13:16.596 --> 13:17.865
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT...

13:17.865 --> 13:19.867
THAT MEANS YOU LEFT ME.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.102
LOOK, IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.271
DO YOU WANT TO FIGHT OR...

13:31.444 --> 13:34.581
DO YOU WANT
SOME OF THE GOOD STUFF?

13:43.957 --> 13:45.758
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY
LEFT ME FOR A DAY,

13:45.758 --> 13:47.027
AND I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT IT.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.797
WHAT HAPPENED
ON OCTOBER 10, 1993?

13:50.797 --> 13:54.401
GOOD STUFF'S GETTIN' COLD.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.271
PUT THAT STUFF AWAY!

13:58.271 --> 14:02.275
I'LL DO
THAT SPECIAL THING.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.377
NO!

14:04.377 --> 14:07.814
REALLY?NO.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.083
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
THAT DAY.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.988
WELL,
WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF?

14:14.988 --> 14:16.156
OKAY, NOT NOW, MOM.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.857
BENNY, PLEASE LEAVE.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.094
OOH-HOO-HOO!
BIG FIGHT!

14:22.529 --> 14:24.998
COULD YOU THROW SOME WINE
IN HIS FACE

14:24.998 --> 14:27.700
SO I'LL AT LEAST
FEEL A PART OF IT?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.169
MOM, OUT.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.943
GEORGE,
PLEASE CALM DOWN.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.577
LOOK, ANGIE,
I HAVE TO KNOW.

14:39.712 --> 14:44.952
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.886
I DID LEAVE,

14:46.886 --> 14:48.221
BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU SAID

14:48.221 --> 14:50.723
THE MOST HORRIBLE THING
TO ME EVER.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.127
YEAH? WHAT WAS THAT?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.869
MY MOM'S MOVIN' IN WITH US.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.604
WHAT?!

15:04.604 --> 15:08.208
THAT'S THE MOST HORRIBLE THING
YOU'VE SAID TO ME EVER.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.878
ANGIE, WE'RE BROKE.
SHE CAN HELP US WITH THE BILLS.

15:11.878 --> 15:15.015
IF SHE MOVES IN,
I MOVE OUT.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.583
YEAH, RIGHT.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.585
I'M SERIOUS.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.053
I WILL LEAVE, GEORGE,

15:20.053 --> 15:22.722
AND I'LL TAKE THE KIDS.

15:22.722 --> 15:27.094
IS THAT A THREAT,
OR ARE YOU SWEETENING THE DEAL?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.069
YOU WEREN'T BLUFFING?

15:36.069 --> 15:38.938
ANGIE, YOU LEFT ME,
AND YOU HAD 20 GRAND.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.874
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY LEAVE.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.078
JUST GOT IN THE CAR AND DROVE
TO SAN DIEGO WITH THE KIDS

15:45.078 --> 15:47.447
AND A SUITCASE FULL OF MONEY.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.918
YOU GAVE UP ON OUR MARRIAGE.

15:51.918 --> 15:54.221
NO, I JUST COULDN'T
STAND THE IDEA

15:54.221 --> 15:56.623
OF LIVING WITH YOUR MOM.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.258
(laughs)

16:01.794 --> 16:03.530
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHIN' AT?

16:03.530 --> 16:09.102
I FORGED ANGIE'S LETTER
TO SCREW WITH YOU GUYS!

16:09.102 --> 16:12.405
WHAT?!

16:12.405 --> 16:15.375
I FOUND THE LETTERS
IN YOUR ROOM.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.078
I KNEW YOU WOULD GET CURIOUS
AND READ ANGIE'S LETTER,

16:18.078 --> 16:21.148
SO I WROTE A FAKE ONE
AND SWITCHED THEM.

16:21.148 --> 16:24.751
WHERE'S
MY ORIGINAL LETTER?

16:24.751 --> 16:27.054
OH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.788
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, MOM?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.390
OH, COME ON!

16:30.390 --> 16:33.126
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY
IF I WROTE SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS

16:33.126 --> 16:36.296
AND THEN ANGIE WOULD ADMIT
SOME KIND OF JUICY SECRET,

16:36.296 --> 16:39.099
LIKE HAVING AN AFFAIR
OR SOMETHING.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.135
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT?

16:42.135 --> 16:44.304
I WAS BORED.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.883
THANK YOU FOR RUINING
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

16:56.883 --> 17:00.853
I MIGHT HAVE HIDDEN
A SMALL FORTUNE FROM YOU,

17:00.853 --> 17:04.023
BUT YOU, YOU...

17:04.023 --> 17:07.627
OPENED AN ENVELOPE
TWO HOURS EARLY.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.834
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN GET PAST THAT.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.336
NICE TRY,

17:16.336 --> 17:20.707
BUT YOU'RE NOT FAKING YOUR WAY
OUT OF THIS.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.642
I'M SORRY.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.144
I MIGHT HAVE LEFT ONCE,
GEORGE,

17:24.144 --> 17:26.079
BUT I CAME RIGHT BACK.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.447
BUT YOU NEVER
CLOSED THE ACCOUNT, ANGIE.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.282
ALL THIS TIME, I WAS COMMITTED
TO OUR MARRIAGE,

17:29.282 --> 17:32.452
BUT YOU HAD ONE HAND ON ME
AND ONE HAND ON THE DOOR.

17:32.452 --> 17:35.155
LOOK, I THINK I DESERVE
2-HANDED LOVE.

17:38.458 --> 17:43.563
I TOLD MY DAD I DIDN'T EVEN
WANT THAT ACCOUNT.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.098
HE THOUGHT
YOU WERE A LOSER,

17:45.098 --> 17:48.968
BUT I SAID YOU WOULD BE
A GREAT HUSBAND AND FATHER,

17:48.968 --> 17:50.937
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:50.937 --> 17:54.207
HE WAS WRONG,
AND I WAS RIGHT.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.842
(door shuts)

17:55.842 --> 17:58.745
THEN PROVE TO ME
YOU'RE A GREAT WIFE AND MOTHER.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.213
LET'S SCREW YOUR DAD
OUT OF 20 GRAND.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.614
GEORGE!

18:01.614 --> 18:03.216
COME ON, IT'LL BE EASY!
PRETEND TO BREAK UP,

18:03.216 --> 18:06.253
YOU GET THE MONEY,
WE'LL GET BACK TOGETHER.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.355
THAT'S A CRAZY IDEA.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.689
SO WE'LL HAVE TO SELL IT,
OKAY?

18:09.689 --> 18:11.458
YOU PRETEND TO BE DEPRESSED
AND STAY IN BED.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.393
I'LL GO OUT WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.094
WHAT?!

18:15.094 --> 18:18.365
JUST FOR A WEEK.

18:18.365 --> 18:21.268
THAT'S IT. I'M GONNA END THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL

18:21.268 --> 18:24.204
AND TELL MY DAD TO
CLOSE THAT ACCOUNT.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.606
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.608
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED,
VIC.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.843
OUR MARRIAGE IS OVER.
SHE'S LEAVING ME.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.446
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.148
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.616
GEORGE, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.618
WHAT'S RIDICULOUS
IS YOU THINKIN'

18:38.618 --> 18:40.287
I COULD BE ADDICTED
TO AIRPLANE GLUE

18:40.287 --> 18:42.289
AND STILL HAVE A FAMILY.

18:43.623 --> 18:47.494
THAT I'M A HUFFER.
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST GO.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.597
DADDY, GEORGE FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE 20 GRAND.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.699
WOULD YOU PLEASE CLOSE
THE SECRET ACCOUNT?

18:52.699 --> 18:55.202
AH, TOO LATE.
I SPENT THE MONEY YEARS AGO.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.371
ALL OF IT?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.006
WELL, I HAD TO LEARN
THE HARD WAY

19:00.006 --> 19:04.211
THAT AMERICA IS NOT READY
FOR CUBAN FAST FOOD.

19:04.211 --> 19:08.281
SO REST IN PEACE,
PLANTAIN EXPRESS.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.583
BUT THAT WAS
A GREAT IDEA, VIC.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.652
"MOMMY DOESN'T WANT
TO COOK TONIGHT, KIDS,

19:12.652 --> 19:16.589
"SO HOW ABOUT A BUCKET
OF LITTLE GREASY BANANAS?"

19:16.589 --> 19:20.427
WHERE DO YOU COME UP
WITH YOUR LITTLE PUT-DOWNS, EH?

19:20.427 --> 19:23.162
MAYBE IT'S WHEN YOU DRIVE
YOUR USED CAR

19:23.162 --> 19:28.401
TO YOUR CRAPPY FACTORY JOB
WHERE YOU MAKE AIRPLANE PARTS.

19:28.401 --> 19:32.405
THEY DON'T EVEN TRUST YOU
TO MAKE THE WHOLE AIRPLANE!

19:39.846 --> 19:43.316
SO...ARE WE OKAY?

19:43.316 --> 19:45.985
YEAH, I THINK SO.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.989
YOU KNOW, WE NEVER GOT
TO READ OUR LETTERS.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.191
I HAVE MINE RIGHT HERE.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.761
WELL, I'LL GET MINE.

20:01.368 --> 20:06.172
"GEORGE,
YOU'RE AN AMAZING MAN.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.940
"GIVING MY HEART TO YOU

20:07.940 --> 20:11.511
"WILL BE THE EASIEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

20:11.511 --> 20:16.283
"I LOOK FORWARD TO SPENDING
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU."

20:16.283 --> 20:20.887
WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS
YOU GAVE IT A TRY.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.227
LET'S HEAR YOURS.

20:30.397 --> 20:37.370
"ANGIE, YOU ARE
UNSPOILED PERFECTION.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.206
"YOUR SMILE, YOUR HEART,
YOUR SOUL.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.542
"YOU'RE AN AMAZING WIFE,

20:42.542 --> 20:45.077
"FRIEND
AND MOTHER TO MY CHILDREN.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.613
"I DON'T DESERVE YOU."

20:46.613 --> 20:47.747
OHH.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.186
THAT'S ME...
REPRESENTIN'.

20:54.186 --> 20:58.024
EVEN WAY BACK THEN.

20:58.024 --> 21:02.395
TOO BAD WAY BACK THEN I WASN'T
THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILDREN.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.796
WE DIDN'T HAVE KIDS YET.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.836
EXPLAIN THAT.
