00:53.185 --> 00:56.821
...hostess for this evening, I
welcome you with open arms.

01:00.059 --> 01:04.429
As your hostess for this evening,
I welcome you with open arms.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.599
Ma, did I get any calls yet?

01:07.667 --> 01:10.769
No, Gloria, that's the 3rd
time you've asked me that

01:10.837 --> 01:14.840
in the last 10 minutes
. What makes you so nervous?

01:14.907 --> 01:17.976
What makes you think I'm nervous?
I'm not nervous.

01:18.043 --> 01:19.410
You're the one who's nervous.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.312
Well, I got a right to be.

01:21.380 --> 01:25.149
I ain't never been in charge
of a tupperware party before.

01:28.220 --> 01:30.254
It's a big responsibility.

01:30.323 --> 01:32.590
Yeah, you're right, and I
hope it's a big success.

01:32.658 --> 01:35.026
Oh, I'm sure it will be.

01:35.093 --> 01:37.495
And Gloria, it couldn't have happened

01:37.563 --> 01:40.097
without your father's planning.

01:40.165 --> 01:41.532
Daddy planned this party?

01:41.600 --> 01:44.736
Yeah, he planned not to be here for it.

01:48.574 --> 01:51.242
Gloria, shouldn't you be getting dressed

01:51.310 --> 01:53.244
for your Marx brothers' festival?

01:53.312 --> 01:55.880
I can't wait to see how you're gonna look.

01:55.947 --> 01:57.815
Oh, ma, there's plenty
of time to get dressed.

01:57.883 --> 02:00.017
Besides, I want to sit
here and wait for my call.

02:00.085 --> 02:03.755
Oh, I'm waiting for one, too. From Archie.

02:03.822 --> 02:06.023
It's late.

02:06.091 --> 02:10.428
Gloria, while you're sitting there,
will you help me with my hands?

02:10.496 --> 02:11.929
What's the matter with them?

02:11.997 --> 02:13.898
Well, I don't know where to put 'em.

02:15.067 --> 02:16.601
You know, in my speech,

02:16.603 --> 02:19.670
introducing miss Henderson,
the tupperware lady.

02:19.738 --> 02:21.206
Now watch. Oh.

02:21.273 --> 02:22.407
[Clears throat]

02:22.475 --> 02:25.076
"I welcome you with open arms."

02:25.144 --> 02:28.480
Or: "I welcome you with open arms."

02:30.749 --> 02:33.451
Which is better, before or after?

02:34.420 --> 02:36.120
How about during?

02:37.223 --> 02:40.925
I welcome you with open arms.

02:41.593 --> 02:43.762
That's it!

02:43.829 --> 02:45.630
Gloria, thanks!

02:45.697 --> 02:46.931
[Mike yelling] Gloria!

02:46.999 --> 02:49.333
Uh, daddy's favorite son-in-law is calling.

02:49.401 --> 02:51.469
I welcome you

02:51.536 --> 02:55.240
with op-- oh! I forgot
to put the coffee on.

02:55.307 --> 02:58.042
Gloria, why aren't you upstairs
getting dressed? It's late.

02:58.110 --> 02:59.610
I'm not going.

02:59.678 --> 03:01.078
What do you mean you're not going?

03:01.146 --> 03:03.581
I said, I'm not going.

03:03.649 --> 03:05.717
Look, Gloria,

03:05.784 --> 03:07.952
I--I--I don't know what I did to make you
change your mind, but whatever it is,

03:08.019 --> 03:10.555
I want to say right up front that
I was wrong, it was all my fault,

03:10.623 --> 03:12.890
I never should've done it,
and I'll never do it again.

03:12.958 --> 03:15.693
And if I haven't done it yet,
I'll be wrong when I do it.

03:15.761 --> 03:17.595
Ok? See that? A nice apology.

03:17.663 --> 03:20.031
Now let's go upstairs and
get dressed, huh? Come on.

03:20.099 --> 03:23.400
But, Michael, I can't go
till I know where daddy is.

03:23.468 --> 03:25.336
I know where he is.

03:25.403 --> 03:27.739
He's up in buffalo at that
stupid lodge convention of his.

03:27.806 --> 03:31.042
No, he isn't. He didn't even
get on the bus this morning.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.243
How do you know that?

03:32.310 --> 03:34.746
Butch mcpherson called from buffalo.

03:34.813 --> 03:36.447
Thank heavens I got the call.

03:36.515 --> 03:38.182
Daddy's supposed to room with him up there.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.485
And he isn't there. Do you hear me?
Daddy isn't even there.

03:40.552 --> 03:42.087
All right, all right, so he missed the bus.

03:42.154 --> 03:43.688
He'll probably go up on a later one.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.056
Well, I hope so.

03:45.124 --> 03:46.824
And butch is going to
check on it and call me,

03:46.892 --> 03:48.893
and I want to wait for that call.

03:48.961 --> 03:51.596
While we are waiting, can we go
upstairs and get dressed, please?

03:51.663 --> 03:54.199
You know, Michael, this isn't like daddy.

03:54.266 --> 03:56.868
He's always on time.

03:56.935 --> 04:00.238
Dinner: 6:00, Walter cronkite: 7:00,

04:00.306 --> 04:03.375
bed: 10:30, and he never misses buses.

04:03.442 --> 04:06.777
Anything can happen once,
Gloria, even to your father.

04:06.845 --> 04:10.581
Like once I remember he was right.

04:10.649 --> 04:14.319
It happens. Now come on, let's go
upstairs and get dressed, please.

04:14.386 --> 04:17.053
But, Michael, what if he's not on that 2nd bus?
Here we go again.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.724
[Exhaling] You're making me nauseous.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.826
I'm afraid. What if he got mugged?

04:21.892 --> 04:23.328
Mugged, mugged!

04:23.395 --> 04:26.230
You're talking just like a
woman, all emotion, no logic.

04:26.298 --> 04:29.133
What kind of male
chauvinistic remark is that?

04:29.201 --> 04:30.769
There's nothing chauvinistic about it.

04:30.836 --> 04:31.969
Oh! Gloria, Gloria,

04:32.037 --> 04:33.371
your father is not on a bus.

04:33.439 --> 04:34.939
What is the logical explanation?

04:35.007 --> 04:36.775
He missed it! See?

04:36.842 --> 04:39.277
I, a man, go straight to the point.
You, a woman, go bananas.

04:39.345 --> 04:41.279
Why don't you, a man, go to hell!

04:43.182 --> 04:44.448
See that? All emotion.

04:44.516 --> 04:46.551
Yeah, but straight to the point.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.286
Now I'm gonna wait for that phone call.

04:49.354 --> 04:51.088
Did you tell your mother about this?

04:51.156 --> 04:54.759
No, Michael, she's havin' a party tonight.
I wouldn't wanna worry her.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.829
And you're right. See? Now
you're thinking like a man.

04:57.897 --> 05:00.465
Michael, you're just-- uh, I
was wrong, I didn't mean that.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.133
That was a slip, it was a slip.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.936
Remember that apology I made
before for nothing? Use it here.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.505
[Doorbell ringing]

05:07.572 --> 05:08.839
That'll be miss Henderson!

05:08.908 --> 05:10.441
Ain't you 2 gonna get dressed?

05:10.509 --> 05:11.776
Yeah, ma.

05:13.812 --> 05:15.146
Irene!

05:15.214 --> 05:16.847
Hi. I heard you were having a meeting.

05:16.916 --> 05:18.383
I thought you'd need a chair lady.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.985
Oh, thanks, Irene!

05:21.053 --> 05:22.586
Have you heard from Archie yet?

05:22.654 --> 05:26.457
No. And he really shoulda called by now.

05:26.525 --> 05:27.525
[Exclaims]

05:27.592 --> 05:29.394
It's almost 8:00.

05:29.461 --> 05:32.563
Oh, my! They're gonna be here any minute.

05:32.631 --> 05:36.968
Irene, would you help me
? Listen to me make my speech.

05:37.036 --> 05:38.903
I'm afraid I'll forget the words.

05:38.971 --> 05:42.307
Oh, don't worry. You're gonna be just fine.

05:42.374 --> 05:46.878
That's what Mrs. kleinschmidt
said, and she was wrong.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.914
Who is Mrs. kleinschmidt?

05:50.982 --> 05:55.820
My 3rd grade teacher. She was
in charge of the nativity play.

05:55.887 --> 06:01.526
I was acting the part of the 3rd
cow standing next to the manger.

06:01.594 --> 06:06.063
I was supposed to say, "moo,
moo, I hear people coming."

06:06.132 --> 06:09.234
And when the first cow
was sayin' his speech,

06:09.301 --> 06:13.238
"moo, moo, here we are,
3 cows in a manger,"

06:13.305 --> 06:17.041
I looked out and I saw my little brother

06:17.109 --> 06:20.311
sittin' in the audience, pickin' his nose.

06:22.748 --> 06:25.016
Well! Ooh!

06:25.117 --> 06:29.787
When it came my turn, I
couldn't think of nothin' else.

06:29.855 --> 06:31.288
So I said it.

06:31.356 --> 06:34.692
"Moo, moo, my little brother
is pickin' his nose."

06:38.096 --> 06:41.365
Edith, your little brother
is not here tonight,

06:41.433 --> 06:43.001
so, come on, let's rehearse.

06:43.068 --> 06:45.069
Oh, yeah. Oh, I--I wrote it down.

06:45.137 --> 06:47.505
Now, see if I remember.

06:47.572 --> 06:48.606
[Clears throat]

06:48.673 --> 06:49.673
Um,

06:50.542 --> 06:52.043
dear friends,

06:53.078 --> 06:56.080
as your hostess for the evening,

06:56.147 --> 06:59.450
I welcome you with open arms.

06:59.517 --> 07:01.519
That's very good.

07:01.586 --> 07:04.889
Yeah, the hands was my idea, but
Gloria told me where to put 'em.

07:06.625 --> 07:10.395
Uh, now, it gives me great pleasure

07:10.462 --> 07:14.666
to introduce miss Lillian Henderson.

07:14.733 --> 07:19.270
If she's on this side, I'll
go, "miss Lillian Henderson."

07:19.338 --> 07:24.309
The lady who is gonna show us
how to lock in our freshness.

07:24.376 --> 07:26.277
That's perfect.

07:26.345 --> 07:29.914
No, the words was right, but I didn't burp.

07:32.184 --> 07:33.518
You didn't what?

07:33.585 --> 07:35.620
Well, these bowls are just like babies.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.790
After you put the food
in, you got to burp 'em.

07:38.857 --> 07:41.292
That's what keeps things fresh.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.229
But I just can't seem to talk
and burp at the same time.

07:46.231 --> 07:48.299
Too bad Archie isn't here.

07:49.234 --> 07:50.335
? [Mike scatting]

07:50.402 --> 07:51.669
? Hooray for captain spalding ?

07:51.737 --> 07:53.037
? the African explorer

07:53.105 --> 07:54.472
? did someone call me schnorrer? ?

07:54.540 --> 07:56.006
? hooray, hooray, hooray ?

07:57.943 --> 08:00.010
This morning I found an
elephant in my pajamas.

08:00.078 --> 08:02.680
How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know.

08:03.882 --> 08:07.819
Don't tell me, James cagney.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.521
Irene, I don't know what I'd do
without you, but I'd rather.

08:11.623 --> 08:13.024
That's very good, Mike.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.259
You think that's good, you
oughtta see my brother.

08:15.327 --> 08:17.061
[Honking]

08:18.830 --> 08:20.498
[Edith exclaiming]

08:24.303 --> 08:25.336
Oh!

08:26.271 --> 08:27.905
[Honking] Ooh!

08:27.973 --> 08:30.541
Oh, my! You look so funny.

08:30.609 --> 08:33.010
You look just like Shirley temple.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.985
What brought all this on?

08:41.053 --> 08:42.219
What did you say?

08:42.287 --> 08:44.288
I said, "what brought all this on?"

08:44.356 --> 08:47.391
I can't tell you, Irene. My mother told
me never to talk with my hands full.

08:47.459 --> 08:48.893
[Gloria honking]

08:48.961 --> 08:51.061
Excuse me, all good things
must come to an end.

08:51.129 --> 08:53.397
But if you play your cards right,
I'll be back for your end later.

08:55.734 --> 08:57.468
What on earth is this all about?

08:57.536 --> 09:00.705
They're goin' to a Marx
brothers' movie festival.

09:00.772 --> 09:04.542
And if they go dressed like that,
they get in for half-price.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.979
Now let's hear the secret word,
and win a year's supply.

09:08.046 --> 09:10.180
Oh, that brings back memories.

09:10.248 --> 09:12.450
Incidentally, so does that coat.

09:12.517 --> 09:14.518
It should, it's your husband's.

09:14.586 --> 09:15.820
Of what?

09:16.455 --> 09:17.822
"Of what" what?

09:17.889 --> 09:19.757
A year's supply of what?

09:21.793 --> 09:23.260
That's a very good question.

09:23.328 --> 09:25.329
Give me a good answer, I'll
give you a 2-year supply.

09:25.397 --> 09:26.630
[Honking]

09:26.698 --> 09:27.831
[Exclaiming]

09:29.034 --> 09:31.535
Oh, my. Oh, my!

09:31.603 --> 09:34.438
I forgot to take the
cake out of the freezer.

09:34.506 --> 09:38.642
I was so worried about my speech,
I forgot about everything else.

09:38.710 --> 09:40.912
Edith, you know your speech perfectly.

09:40.979 --> 09:42.880
We'll go over it a few times.

09:42.948 --> 09:45.816
Michael, I hope we don't get arrested
walking down the streets like this.

09:45.884 --> 09:46.951
You kiddin' me? This is New York.

09:47.018 --> 09:48.619
We'll be lucky if anybody notices us.

09:49.488 --> 09:50.521
[Phone rings]

09:50.589 --> 09:52.557
Oh, I hope that's butch mcpherson.

09:52.624 --> 09:53.857
I'll get it, ma!

09:54.659 --> 09:56.394
Hello? Butch?

09:57.229 --> 09:59.230
Did daddy get there yet?

10:00.132 --> 10:02.466
He didn't? Oh, my God.

10:02.534 --> 10:04.201
Gloria, is that your father?

10:04.269 --> 10:06.103
Uh, no, ma. It's for me.

10:06.171 --> 10:09.340
Oh, but it ought to be your father.
It's almost 8:00.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.708
He shoulda called 2 hours ago.

10:11.776 --> 10:14.111
Are you sure it ain't your father?

10:14.179 --> 10:15.746
Oh, of course it isn't daddy.

10:15.814 --> 10:18.248
If it was, you'd be talking to him.

10:19.017 --> 10:20.951
That's right.

10:23.855 --> 10:25.956
What is it? What is it? Still there, butch?

10:26.024 --> 10:29.193
No, we haven't heard from him.
He hasn't called.

10:30.495 --> 10:32.797
Where can he be?

10:32.864 --> 10:35.766
Well, will you keep
looking for him, please?

10:35.834 --> 10:38.468
And if there's any news, you'll call.

10:38.536 --> 10:40.137
Yeah. Thank you.

10:41.539 --> 10:44.441
Michael, he wasn't on the 2nd bus either.

10:44.509 --> 10:46.010
Daddy's missing. All right.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.945
Take it-- take it easy. Take--take it easy.

10:48.013 --> 10:50.915
Michael, don't tell me to take
it easy, don't you understand?

10:50.983 --> 10:52.382
Daddy is missing.

10:52.450 --> 10:55.686
I got it right! I got the bowl to burp!

10:55.754 --> 10:59.423
And Irene says it sounds
better than Archie.

Dear friends, I welcome you with open arms.

11:12.037 --> 11:13.370
[Doorbell rings]

11:13.438 --> 11:15.605
Dear friends, I welcome
you with open-- coming!

11:18.109 --> 11:19.643
Miss Henderson!

11:19.711 --> 11:21.078
Direct from tupperware.

11:21.146 --> 11:22.179
Oh!

11:24.415 --> 11:28.185
Oh, it's 8:00. You're right on time.

11:28.253 --> 11:31.722
There's no such word as "late"
in my vocabulary, Mrs. bunker.

11:31.789 --> 11:33.524
Even on days like today,

11:33.592 --> 11:36.194
when I have to fly in all
the way from schenectady.

11:36.261 --> 11:37.862
Schenectady.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.731
Oh, yes.

11:39.798 --> 11:41.766
I think that's one of the things
that attracted me to tupperware.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.972
Oh, I'm just a born traveler.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.242
Always spreading my wings,
and hitting the road.

11:51.309 --> 11:53.444
Oh, hitting the road.

11:53.511 --> 11:55.613
My, that sounds so romantic.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.249
Oh, yes. The constant adventure

11:58.316 --> 12:01.185
of journeying to new, exciting places.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.921
Newark, hoboken, Hartford.

12:05.858 --> 12:10.060
The approach to utica as
you come off the thruway!

12:10.162 --> 12:11.796
[Exclaims]

12:11.863 --> 12:15.900
You sound just like <i>the
happy wanderer</i> on T.V.

12:15.968 --> 12:16.968
[Laughing]

12:17.035 --> 12:19.336
Well, I just find it all so stimulating.

12:19.404 --> 12:22.239
This week Brooklyn, next week Bethlehem.

12:22.307 --> 12:24.775
Bethlehem? The Bethlehem?

12:24.843 --> 12:28.378
That's right. Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

12:28.446 --> 12:30.981
Oh! Oh, yeah.

12:31.049 --> 12:32.049
Oh.

12:32.116 --> 12:33.350
[Gasps]

12:33.418 --> 12:35.152
Mrs. bunker.

12:35.219 --> 12:36.987
You've broken up a family.

12:37.055 --> 12:38.789
I have?

12:38.857 --> 12:40.258
Look at that servalier.

12:40.325 --> 12:42.393
What's it doing with the wonderliers?

12:42.460 --> 12:44.728
I don't know.

12:44.796 --> 12:46.897
It certainly didn't get there by itself.

12:46.965 --> 12:48.198
Did it?

12:48.266 --> 12:50.133
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:50.201 --> 12:51.535
[Inaudible]

12:52.504 --> 12:53.671
Oh, you--you see,

12:53.739 --> 12:57.341
between worrying about my
speech, and why my husband

12:57.409 --> 13:00.544
had to-- ooh! No, no, no,
no, not the jiffysift.

13:00.612 --> 13:03.013
It's by the flavor saver.

13:03.081 --> 13:06.050
It's the servalier that's lost.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.586
There. Now it's back home.

13:09.655 --> 13:13.323
Oh, my! And you spotted it, just like that.

13:13.391 --> 13:17.127
Every little tupper has
a family of its own.

13:20.165 --> 13:21.698
Mrs. bunker,

13:21.766 --> 13:24.368
this is an occasion, you know.

13:24.436 --> 13:28.605
There are 3 things a woman
remembers all her life:

13:28.673 --> 13:30.474
Her wedding night,

13:30.542 --> 13:33.677
the birth of her first child,

13:33.745 --> 13:36.780
and her first tupperware party.

13:39.251 --> 13:41.185
That's beautiful.

13:42.387 --> 13:44.922
(Edith) Gloria, Mike.

13:44.989 --> 13:47.258
What are you doing in the cellar?

13:47.325 --> 13:49.726
Uh, we were lookin' for the celery!

13:49.794 --> 13:51.262
[Honking]

13:52.598 --> 13:54.632
You're having entertainment for the party.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.301
What a lovely idea, Mrs. bunker.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.605
Tupperware won't pay for that.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.908
No, no, they ain't entertainment.

14:04.976 --> 14:08.713
That's my son-in-law and my
daughter, Gloria and Mike stivic.

14:08.780 --> 14:11.048
And miss Henderson.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.617
How do you do?

14:15.554 --> 14:16.954
Well, they're dressed that way

14:17.021 --> 14:19.357
'cause they're goin' to the movies.

14:19.424 --> 14:20.458
Oh.

14:22.261 --> 14:25.463
Gloria, what were you doing
carrying the phone around?

14:25.530 --> 14:27.064
[Gasps] Did Archie call?

14:27.132 --> 14:30.501
Uh, no, ma. We were just checkin'
to see what time the movie starts.

14:30.569 --> 14:33.504
Why did you have to go
to the cellar for that?

14:33.572 --> 14:34.672
[Doorbell ringing]

14:34.740 --> 14:35.873
[Gasps]

14:35.940 --> 14:37.608
Mrs. bunker, I think our
guests have arrived.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.410
Oh, yeah, they're here!

14:39.478 --> 14:42.313
Oh, tell me when Archie calls.

14:43.047 --> 14:44.682
Come on, Michael.

14:45.984 --> 14:48.085
Michael, what are we gonna do?

14:48.153 --> 14:50.488
We're gonna go to the movies,
that's what we're gonna do.

14:50.555 --> 14:51.989
What? Gloria,

14:52.056 --> 14:55.192
it is the only calm, rational
thing to do, believe me.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.694
Believe you? No.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.496
I have to believe all those
phone calls we just made.

14:58.563 --> 15:00.464
Nobody saw him on the bus.

15:00.532 --> 15:02.566
All right, so he took a plane.

15:02.634 --> 15:04.468
Gloria, didn't butch
mcpherson say he'd call

15:04.536 --> 15:06.103
when Archie got there?

15:06.171 --> 15:07.938
Right. All right, so it's
crazy to miss the festival

15:08.006 --> 15:10.440
waitin' for a phone call, now come on.

15:10.508 --> 15:12.809
Michael, I know you fight with daddy a lot,

15:12.877 --> 15:16.713
but I--I always thought it was
because you didn't agree with him.

15:16.781 --> 15:18.482
I didn't know that you hated him.

15:18.550 --> 15:19.950
I don't hate him.

15:20.018 --> 15:21.085
You hate him.

15:21.152 --> 15:22.286
I don't hate him!

15:22.354 --> 15:23.621
You hate him!

15:23.688 --> 15:26.156
Gloria, you better quit while you're ahead.

15:27.159 --> 15:28.425
Well, if you don't hate him,

15:28.493 --> 15:29.894
how can you think of going to the movies

15:29.961 --> 15:31.529
while he's missing out there?

15:31.596 --> 15:34.598
He's not missing. We just
mislaid him, that's all.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.201
Something's happened to him.

15:37.268 --> 15:39.203
I know something's happened to him.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.105
You know something's happened to him.
How do you know, Gloria?

15:41.172 --> 15:42.906
You tell me, you give me one scrap of fact

15:42.974 --> 15:45.809
and I won't go to the movies.
One little fact.

15:45.876 --> 15:48.778
Michael, I-I'm just
worried about my father.

15:49.847 --> 15:51.515
Hey, honey, I know you're worried,

15:51.583 --> 15:54.551
but I also know that you're
worrying unnecessarily.

15:54.619 --> 15:57.687
You know Archie. He probably
checked into another hotel.

15:57.755 --> 15:59.323
Why would he do that?

15:59.390 --> 16:01.092
Well, you heard him this morning.

16:01.159 --> 16:03.127
Boasting about how much expense
money the lodge was giving him.

16:03.195 --> 16:04.227
$35 a day.

16:04.295 --> 16:05.463
So?

16:05.530 --> 16:07.598
Well, he probably checked
into some fleabag hotel,

16:07.666 --> 16:10.434
and he's pocketing the rest of the money.

16:10.502 --> 16:13.637
That's a terrible thing
to say about my father.

16:13.705 --> 16:16.940
I thought it was one of the nicest
things I ever said about him.

16:17.008 --> 16:18.675
How could you even say--

16:18.743 --> 16:19.810
I welcome you with open arms.

16:19.877 --> 16:21.278
Dear friends, I welcome you with open arms.

16:21.346 --> 16:23.347
Dear friends, I welcome you with open arms.

16:24.015 --> 16:25.449
[Mumbles]

16:25.517 --> 16:28.352
Gloria, honey, listen. There's
nothing to worry about.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.320
Nothing?

16:30.388 --> 16:32.990
Michael, with all the trouble that's
going on in the world these days?

16:33.058 --> 16:35.792
People being shot in the
streets for no reason.

16:35.860 --> 16:37.528
Murder for murder's sake.

16:37.595 --> 16:38.863
You're talking paranoid, Gloria.

16:38.930 --> 16:40.965
That's what's wrong with
everybody these days.

16:41.032 --> 16:44.969
Everybody's afraid. Whatever happened
to trusting your fellow man?

16:48.239 --> 16:51.041
You really think he checked
into a different hotel?

16:51.109 --> 16:53.577
It makes sense, doesn't it?

16:53.645 --> 16:55.211
You could be right, Michael.

16:55.279 --> 16:57.981
[Honks] Of course I'm right.
Excuse me. Now trust me.

16:58.049 --> 16:59.550
Come on, now let's go to the movies.

16:59.617 --> 17:01.518
We're gonna have a good time, huh?

17:01.586 --> 17:03.921
I mean, yeah, after all, what's
the worst that could happen?

17:03.988 --> 17:05.722
He could come home.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.727
[Women chattering]

17:11.863 --> 17:14.799
Edith, it's a lovely party.

17:14.866 --> 17:19.303
Oh, thanks, Louise, but we ain't
heard a word from Archie.

17:19.369 --> 17:22.006
I'll say it again: It's a lovely party.

17:22.740 --> 17:23.840
[Doorbell rings]

17:23.909 --> 17:26.210
Oh! There's more people. Oh!

17:26.278 --> 17:29.280
It looks like we're gonna
have a full house.

17:30.381 --> 17:32.950
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. estrada.

17:33.018 --> 17:34.151
[Speaking spanish] Come in.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.153
[Speaking spanish] Hello.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.788
Oh, I'm glad you came.

17:37.856 --> 17:41.192
Miss Henderson, I'd like you
to meet some friends of mine,

17:41.259 --> 17:45.195
Alfredo estrada, a-and his wife, Maria.

17:45.197 --> 17:46.997
(Alfredo) Hello. How do you do?

17:47.065 --> 17:51.134
A man, Mrs. bunker, at a tupperware party.

17:51.202 --> 17:54.705
Oh, I know he's a man, but
he ain't here as a man.

17:54.773 --> 17:57.307
He's here to listen for his wife.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.609
Oh.

17:59.777 --> 18:01.745
Is--is she deaf?

18:01.813 --> 18:03.580
No, puerto rican.

18:07.352 --> 18:09.753
I--I--I'm here to translate for her.

18:09.821 --> 18:13.823
Oh! Oh, oh, well then, in
that case, he can stay.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.893
As a matter of fact, Mr. estrada,

18:16.961 --> 18:19.296
I have just the thing
for you and your wife.

18:19.364 --> 18:23.333
Oh. Our pie holder also
doubles as a tortella holder.

18:28.506 --> 18:30.774
Puerto ricans don't eat tortellas.

18:30.841 --> 18:33.077
We don't even eat tortillas.

18:34.278 --> 18:36.347
[Speaking spanish]

18:36.414 --> 18:38.082
[Speaking spanish]

18:43.788 --> 18:47.691
Oh, they're such a happy
people, aren't they?

18:49.694 --> 18:51.328
Excuse me.

18:51.396 --> 18:54.999
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson, I can't
tell you how delighted I am

18:55.066 --> 18:57.034
to see you here tonight.

18:57.102 --> 18:59.103
Oh, do we know each other?

18:59.170 --> 19:01.905
No, but we have overcome, haven't we?

19:05.543 --> 19:07.043
We have?

19:07.111 --> 19:09.012
Oh, my goodness, yes.

19:09.080 --> 19:13.384
Why, only last week I hosted
an all-black tupperware party.

19:13.451 --> 19:15.586
Oh, it couldn't have been all-black.

19:15.653 --> 19:16.854
But it was.

19:16.921 --> 19:19.155
Didn't you say you were there?

19:22.026 --> 19:23.827
Oh, I see what you mean.

19:23.895 --> 19:28.198
Well, anyway, I took in $300 that night.

19:28.265 --> 19:30.901
Even though I was the only hunky there.

19:37.074 --> 19:38.241
Hunky.

19:39.143 --> 19:41.111
That's black for "white."

19:45.550 --> 19:47.484
Is that right?

19:49.787 --> 19:52.256
Sometimes I wish I were white,

19:52.323 --> 19:56.025
so I could get used to using all
of those black expressions, too.

19:59.564 --> 20:03.900
Edith, I think maybe this is a good
time for you to begin your speech.

20:03.968 --> 20:06.603
Oh, Irene, I'm so nervous.

20:06.671 --> 20:09.306
You're among friends. You're gonna be fine.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.308
Oh, I hope so.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.810
Just don't think about your
little brother picking his nose.

20:15.180 --> 20:18.582
Ladies, we're ready to start.
Why don't you all sit down?

20:22.987 --> 20:27.891
Uh, welcome to my very
first tupperware party.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.327
[Gasps]

20:35.567 --> 20:37.601
Uh, um, as your hostess

20:37.669 --> 20:39.536
for this evening--

20:39.604 --> 20:41.238
Gloria! How could you do a
crazy, stupid thing like that.

20:41.306 --> 20:42.306
Will you answer me?

20:42.373 --> 20:43.574
[Honks]

20:46.043 --> 20:47.444
I-I'm sorry.

20:47.512 --> 20:50.547
Oh, don't apologize, they were very good.

20:51.949 --> 20:53.250
Bravo, bravo.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.285
Oh, thank you, thank you.

20:56.721 --> 21:00.324
As your hostess for this evening...

21:12.069 --> 21:15.071
As your hostess for this evening,

21:15.139 --> 21:17.774
I welcome you with open noses.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.417
Um, uh...

21:26.484 --> 21:29.719
Oh, I mean I welcome you with open ar...

21:37.362 --> 21:40.564
You agreed, Gloria. You agreed
to go to <i>duck soup</i> with me.

21:40.631 --> 21:41.765
Leave me alone.

21:41.832 --> 21:43.700
I agreed to leave before <i>horse feathers,</i>

21:43.768 --> 21:46.002
but we never even got
there to see <i>duck soup.</i>

21:46.071 --> 21:49.039
Oh, stop it, Michael. Haven't you
ever changed your mind before?

21:49.107 --> 21:52.142
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't
go to the movies with you,

21:52.210 --> 21:55.012
but every minute I'm getting
more and more frightened.

21:55.079 --> 21:56.380
[Phone ringing]

21:56.447 --> 21:58.115
Oh, that might be butch!

22:00.251 --> 22:01.518
Ma, that's a call to me!

22:01.585 --> 22:05.055
No! I mean, yes, operator. I'll hold on.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.556
Ma, I know that call's for me.

22:06.624 --> 22:11.829
Not this time. This is a collect
call, so I know it's from Archie.

22:11.896 --> 22:14.431
Hello, Archie.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.900
Oh, excuse me, butch.

22:18.703 --> 22:20.170
Oh, what?

22:20.237 --> 22:24.842
Would you mind talkin' louder?
We're havin' a party here.

22:24.909 --> 22:27.110
Ye-yeah, where is Archie?

22:27.178 --> 22:29.245
[People chattering]

22:29.313 --> 22:30.547
What?

22:33.718 --> 22:35.885
Well, where could he be?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.457
Well, did you check...

22:42.794 --> 22:45.095
Oh, I see.

22:46.497 --> 22:48.165
Oh, no, sure.

22:48.232 --> 22:52.001
Butch, you go back to your table.
Yeah, goodbye.

22:54.238 --> 22:56.839
Archie ain't at the banquet.

22:56.907 --> 22:59.476
He ain't even in buffalo.

22:59.543 --> 23:00.410
We know, ma.

23:00.478 --> 23:03.447
Oh, I knew something was
wrong when he didn't--

23:03.514 --> 23:06.049
you knew. Why didn't you tell me?

23:06.116 --> 23:08.285
Well, I was hoping he'd turn
up there on a later bus,

23:08.353 --> 23:10.020
and I--I didn't wanna worry you.

23:10.088 --> 23:13.490
Gloria, where could he be?

23:13.557 --> 23:16.626
Ma, everything's all right
. Everything'll be fine. Daddy's ok.

23:16.694 --> 23:19.796
No! Archie's always on time.

23:19.863 --> 23:23.933
Dinner at 6:00, cronkite
at 7:00, bedtime is 10:30.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.770
Something's happened to him.

23:33.344 --> 23:36.112
Edith, everything's back in its place now.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.914
It's all going just fine.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.148
[All agreeing]

23:39.217 --> 23:40.917
(Woman) Fabulous party.

23:40.984 --> 23:44.487
Everybody, please, please.
Can we have some quiet?

23:44.555 --> 23:45.755
Please.

23:47.758 --> 23:49.526
Ma, are you all right?

23:49.594 --> 23:51.561
Certainly she's all right.

23:51.629 --> 23:54.497
She's just a little overwhelmed by it all.

23:54.565 --> 23:56.466
Like I said,

23:56.534 --> 23:59.936
we never forget our first tupperware party.

24:00.004 --> 24:03.874
Now, ladies, I must show you
our brand new cracker keeper.

24:03.941 --> 24:05.608
Come on, girls. (Woman) Oh, they're good.
