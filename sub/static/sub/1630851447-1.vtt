00:57.347 --> 00:59.750

00:59.783 --> 01:00.783
If you do not..

01:01.784 --> 01:03.319

- Hey.

01:03.353 --> 01:04.288
Frank, you're there?

01:04.320 --> 01:06.055
Hey, can you hear me?

01:06.088 --> 01:06.923
Frankie, I can't
fucking hear you, be clear.

01:06.956 --> 01:08.034
It's just real loud in here.

01:08.058 --> 01:08.692
Hold on a sec.

01:08.725 --> 01:09.393
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:09.426 --> 01:10.394
Can you hear me now?

01:10.427 --> 01:11.762
Yeah.

01:11.795 --> 01:12.938
How are you, do you
want us to come get you?

01:12.962 --> 01:14.330
No, listen, I got my truck.

01:14.364 --> 01:15.941
I wanna head straight over
to the shop at five o'clock.

01:15.965 --> 01:18.434
Shop, all right, yeah,
now we'll meet you there.

01:18.468 --> 01:20.204
Yeah, okay.

01:21.905 --> 01:23.340
How is crystal doing?

01:23.373 --> 01:25.743
She's good, she made a pancake,

01:25.775 --> 01:27.343
she's watching
cartoons with pack.

01:28.545 --> 01:32.015
Hey, daddy's coming home.

01:49.399 --> 01:50.433
Stay, stay.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.085
Hey sweetie.

02:12.087 --> 02:13.123
How'd she do?

02:15.258 --> 02:18.128
Yeah, she did all right.

02:18.161 --> 02:19.128
You wanna go see daddy?

02:19.162 --> 02:22.165
Hey, crystal, sweetie.

02:23.567 --> 02:24.968
Come on, come on.

02:28.905 --> 02:30.373
Okay, stay with her.

02:36.278 --> 02:37.313
I get it.

02:40.050 --> 02:41.986
It's okay, it's okay.

02:43.319 --> 02:44.555
Come on.

03:38.540 --> 03:40.509
All right, look, this morning-

03:40.543 --> 03:41.545
- this morning what?

03:43.045 --> 03:44.247
I should have fed the dog?

03:44.281 --> 03:45.524
I should have put
gas in the truck?

03:45.548 --> 03:47.251
Because I did all that shit.

03:47.783 --> 03:49.052
I know, I messed up.

03:54.491 --> 03:57.027
You shit all over Saturday
morning is what you did.

03:57.060 --> 03:59.263
You just completely destroyed
the love of the day,

03:59.295 --> 04:01.430
you left a fucking crater, like

04:02.632 --> 04:04.033
sadness.

04:07.704 --> 04:09.640
Look, I know that it's expensive

04:09.673 --> 04:12.209
and I know that we're poor, but-

04:12.241 --> 04:13.009
- we're not, we're
not, we're not poor.

04:13.043 --> 04:14.378
All right, fine.

04:14.411 --> 04:15.554
We're clinging to
the last branch

04:15.578 --> 04:17.381
of the lower middle
class, whatever.

04:19.415 --> 04:20.983
It's where I want to go.

04:21.016 --> 04:22.418
It's not just the money.

04:24.153 --> 04:26.189
Is it because the
school is closer to her?

04:26.723 --> 04:27.723
Yeah.

04:29.391 --> 04:30.694
All right, fine.

04:30.726 --> 04:33.963
I'll go to unh Manchester,
five blocks away.

04:33.997 --> 04:36.133
But start compromising now
so it won't be such a shock

04:36.165 --> 04:38.668
when I'm a balding 49 year
old supermarket checkout girl

04:38.701 --> 04:40.937
with carpal fucking tunnel.

04:40.971 --> 04:41.538
All right, good,
then it's settled.

04:41.571 --> 04:43.240
Fuck you.

04:43.273 --> 04:44.273
You're not funny.

04:55.285 --> 04:56.285
All right, look.

04:59.755 --> 05:02.224
Just fucking do it, okay?

05:02.257 --> 05:04.394
I'll take out
loans and all that.

05:04.427 --> 05:05.462
All right?

05:07.730 --> 05:09.300
Just fucking do it.

05:10.766 --> 05:13.469
You know someday I'm gonna
make a lot of money, dad.

05:13.502 --> 05:15.338
You won't have to
work so hard, okay?

05:16.238 --> 05:18.441
Yeah, I don't mind
working hard, but thank you.

05:24.346 --> 05:25.614
So can you go now or?

05:25.648 --> 05:26.717
Oh, hold on a second.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.485
Let me ask you.

05:28.517 --> 05:31.253
Oh definitely, no, look
at this, it's disgusting.

05:31.286 --> 05:33.432
How did you know that's what
I was going to ask you about?

05:33.456 --> 05:35.426
How about you can put
on the shirt I bought you.

05:42.098 --> 05:43.408
Hey, do you mind if
I borrow that jacket

05:43.432 --> 05:45.302
if I ever get a date?

05:46.668 --> 05:48.004
Fucking protein powder.

05:52.307 --> 05:54.211
- Hey!
- Wow, so gorgeous.

05:55.677 --> 05:57.346
Hey, it's nice to see you.

05:57.379 --> 05:58.415
Nice to see you.

05:58.447 --> 06:01.617
Look at your hair, it's nice.

06:01.651 --> 06:02.752
You want to give me a hit?

06:02.786 --> 06:03.786
Of what?

06:03.819 --> 06:05.654
Of what, of what?

06:05.687 --> 06:08.091
Frank's not even here, you're
not going to get in trouble.

06:08.124 --> 06:10.193
Yeah, you're good
out here I bet.

06:10.225 --> 06:11.394
Just one hit.

06:12.694 --> 06:14.264
Whoop whoop.

06:18.100 --> 06:18.769
Tell me where I can
get it, you know.

06:18.802 --> 06:20.637
Don't smoke.

06:20.670 --> 06:21.705
It's good.

06:22.805 --> 06:23.673
What's going on out here?

06:23.706 --> 06:25.641
- Hi Frankie.
- Nothing. Hey, frank.

06:25.841 --> 06:28.077
Crystal, it's way too
cold, put something warmer on.

06:28.110 --> 06:30.247
I don't want you
out here like this.

06:30.279 --> 06:31.347
Why are you laughing?

06:33.283 --> 06:34.350
What'd you cook?

06:35.285 --> 06:37.254
Hey, hey, where are you going?

06:44.226 --> 06:44.827
I'm not burning no
sausages, not burning.

06:44.860 --> 06:46.529
I'm telling you right now.

06:46.562 --> 06:47.673
That's the protein
of the fucking meal.

06:47.697 --> 06:49.298
You don't burn the sausages.

06:49.331 --> 06:51.834
Hey, you guys take a look
at the Christmas tree yet?

06:51.867 --> 06:52.968
Fucking gorgeous.

06:53.002 --> 06:54.713
Perfect, that's good,
I love these sweet sausages.

06:54.737 --> 06:57.407
Hey, you want this fine wine?

06:57.439 --> 06:58.651
One legged duck
swim in a circle.

06:58.675 --> 07:00.276
- Circle.
- Crystal, I love that

07:00.310 --> 07:01.677
Christmas tree, it
looks beautiful.

07:01.711 --> 07:05.182
- This looks beautiful.
- Let's eat, I'm starving.

07:08.718 --> 07:10.854
Make a room, you want more?

07:10.887 --> 07:12.521
Yeah.

07:12.555 --> 07:13.723
This are delicious.

07:13.755 --> 07:14.623
That's a nice shirt, frank.

07:14.656 --> 07:15.724
Thanks.

07:15.757 --> 07:16.358
They made that for men?

07:16.391 --> 07:17.528
Hey, I bought him that.

07:19.562 --> 07:20.463
Yeah, I like it.

07:20.497 --> 07:22.264
Old man don't smoke anymore.

07:22.298 --> 07:23.367
I got him to quit.

07:24.233 --> 07:25.769
Did you?

07:25.802 --> 07:27.446
Yeah, I posted photos of
rotten cancer infested lungs

07:27.470 --> 07:28.470
all over the house.

07:30.372 --> 07:33.476
Oh, maybe one night, we
don't fucking drink so much.

07:33.509 --> 07:35.211
Come on, frank, it's Christmas.

07:35.245 --> 07:36.579
You see how wound up he is,

07:36.612 --> 07:38.548
could you maybe
like take him out,

07:38.581 --> 07:39.483
and meet somebody or something.

07:39.516 --> 07:41.585
Like what, for his penis?

07:41.617 --> 07:42.586
Take it easy.

07:42.619 --> 07:44.454
All he wants to do is
be here or at his shop.

07:44.487 --> 07:45.422
It's true.

07:45.454 --> 07:46.899
Because every time I
go to a bar with you too

07:46.923 --> 07:48.792
you get wasted and
fucking start shit.

07:48.824 --> 07:50.627
And thus, you
never meet anybody.

07:50.660 --> 07:52.562
As far as meeting
somebody though,

07:52.595 --> 07:54.631
you did mean like
a female, right?

07:54.663 --> 07:56.199
Swaino, you know who you are?

07:56.232 --> 07:58.735
You're the guy who makes
one too many gay jokes.

08:05.507 --> 08:08.478
You know what, I got nothing
but love for you tonight.

08:08.511 --> 08:11.348
'Cause we're having a
beautiful dinner at Frankie's.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.415
You're a good man, packie.

08:13.449 --> 08:16.819
It's good, all of
us together, right?

08:18.454 --> 08:20.156
How's that school search coming?

08:20.189 --> 08:21.600
Those college essays
turned out good, right?

08:21.624 --> 08:22.867
Yeah, thanks for your
help on those packie.

08:22.891 --> 08:24.661
They turned out real well.

08:24.694 --> 08:29.700
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know.

08:30.733 --> 08:32.769
What, what's the matter?

08:32.802 --> 08:33.937
No, nothing's wrong.

08:33.970 --> 08:36.373
Hey, what'd you
fucking say to her?

08:36.405 --> 08:38.375
I don't know, I'm sorry.

08:38.408 --> 08:39.442
Packie, what's going on?

08:39.475 --> 08:42.312
Hey, Chris.

08:48.817 --> 08:50.486
Hey, fuck this school.

08:50.519 --> 08:52.188
I was the same way, you know,

08:52.221 --> 08:54.557
you just kind of have to find
your own path to knowledge.

08:54.591 --> 08:55.692
Congratulations.

08:56.658 --> 08:57.793
It says you got in.

08:57.826 --> 09:00.697
Did I get in, did I get in?

09:00.730 --> 09:02.932
How's early acceptance
motherfuckers?

09:07.669 --> 09:10.540
- Oh, crystal!
- Did you fucking know?

09:13.842 --> 09:15.511
Of course I know,
I'm paying for it.

09:15.544 --> 09:16.544
Hey!

09:17.013 --> 09:19.282
Of course he fucking knew!

09:19.315 --> 09:20.751
Oh.

09:21.485 --> 09:24.287
Hey, hey, hey, merry
fucking Christmas.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.388
Merry Christmas.

09:25.421 --> 09:26.421
Merry fucking Christmas.

09:27.990 --> 09:29.425
Ucla

09:29.458 --> 09:30.826
you're smart.

09:30.860 --> 09:32.571
Los angels could be a
dangerous place, trust me.

09:32.595 --> 09:34.431
You got to keep your
head on a swivel.

09:34.464 --> 09:35.673
You ain't been on
a fucking airplane.

09:35.697 --> 09:36.732
Not the point here.

09:36.765 --> 09:37.634
All right, you're right.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.668
So if a guy comes
at you with a knife.

09:39.701 --> 09:40.836
Yeah.

09:40.870 --> 09:42.504
You just pivot
your wrist like this.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.840
Oh.

09:45.375 --> 09:46.743
You've got to try to stab me.

09:46.775 --> 09:47.676
Well, an attacker is
not going to tell you

09:47.710 --> 09:48.677
he's gonna stab you.

09:48.711 --> 09:49.613
I'm just putting that out.

09:49.645 --> 09:50.685
Let's do it, you're right.

09:50.712 --> 09:51.947
You're right, I'm wrong.

09:51.980 --> 09:54.884
So then you pivot
the wrist like that.

09:55.985 --> 09:57.821
I'm not playing anymore.

09:58.888 --> 10:00.724
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.495
Dad, can I have one cigarette?

10:06.528 --> 10:07.831
Thought you quit with me.

10:07.864 --> 10:10.767
It's just one.

10:10.799 --> 10:11.333
What about the cancer?

10:11.366 --> 10:13.035
Oh, shut up, packie.

10:13.068 --> 10:14.870
Going to ucla, she's
gonna cure cancer.

10:14.903 --> 10:16.538
Frankie, give her a cigarette.

10:16.572 --> 10:17.774
Give her one.

10:17.807 --> 10:19.908
- No.
- Just give her one.

10:19.942 --> 10:21.344
Fuck it.

10:21.376 --> 10:23.312
You know you owe me
after this morning.

10:23.346 --> 10:24.714
What happened this morning?

10:24.746 --> 10:26.725
Got into an argument and he
punched a hole in the wall.

10:26.749 --> 10:28.485
At least he didn't-

10:28.518 --> 10:31.654
- hey swaino, can I wear brown
boots with a black jacket?

10:31.687 --> 10:32.855
Once I get to see the boots.

10:32.889 --> 10:34.024
Why are you asking him?

10:34.057 --> 10:36.067
Once I start buying my clothes
from a fucking garbage can

10:36.091 --> 10:37.091
I'll ask you.

10:38.427 --> 10:39.796
Thank you, sensei.

10:41.530 --> 10:42.832
Hey, so listen to me.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.670
So Karen's coming over
tonight to bring crystal out.

10:47.703 --> 10:48.537
Oh my god.

10:48.571 --> 10:49.605
Tonight?

10:49.639 --> 10:50.139
Yeah.

10:50.173 --> 10:51.508
She's coming here?

10:51.541 --> 10:53.076
The fucking cunt
is back in town.

10:53.109 --> 10:54.452
Don't use that language
in front of crystal.

10:54.476 --> 10:54.877
What the fuck should
I call her then?

10:54.910 --> 10:56.712
Bitch, whore?

10:56.745 --> 10:58.514
What, I'm just trying
to help, skank?

10:58.548 --> 10:59.916
It's the mother of my child,

10:59.948 --> 11:01.317
can you show some
fucking respect?

11:01.350 --> 11:01.985
She don't
fucking deserve respect.

11:02.019 --> 11:04.053
So do it for crystal then.

11:04.086 --> 11:05.788
This is fucking
bullshit, Frankie.

11:05.822 --> 11:07.590
You should've told us.

11:21.971 --> 11:23.005
Hey frank, frank,

11:24.440 --> 11:26.576
don't look directly
into her eyes.

11:30.812 --> 11:32.115
Hey.

11:32.148 --> 11:33.148
Hey.

11:37.953 --> 11:38.954
Jesus Christ.

11:38.988 --> 11:39.789
How are you doing?

11:39.822 --> 11:40.856
How's things frank?

11:41.591 --> 11:43.860
I'm actually pretty
good, actually.

11:45.427 --> 11:46.562
How long are you in town?

11:46.596 --> 11:48.899
I don't know, a couple
of days, we'll see.

11:49.899 --> 11:52.968
So, you still not drinking
and doing your push ups?

11:55.605 --> 11:57.005
You look good too.

11:57.038 --> 11:58.708
Oh, and I didn't
need to quit shit.

11:59.609 --> 12:00.576
How are you faggots doing?

12:00.610 --> 12:02.644
I'm doing good?

12:02.677 --> 12:03.846
Really?

12:03.879 --> 12:05.090
You act like I'm the
devil or something.

12:05.114 --> 12:07.117
Kind of fucking worse.

12:08.017 --> 12:08.918
Ma.

12:08.951 --> 12:10.986
Oh, look at you.

12:11.019 --> 12:12.755
Oh my god.

12:12.788 --> 12:14.490
You're goddamn gorgeous.

12:14.524 --> 12:17.025
Look at this hair,
oh my god, it grew.

12:17.058 --> 12:18.894
It's been a year, Karen.

12:18.927 --> 12:20.830
Okay, thank you.

12:20.863 --> 12:22.699
We've got some catching
up to do, don't we?

12:22.731 --> 12:24.867
Tonight is your night, I'm
gonna spoil you so bad.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.902
You've got fake tits, Karen.

12:26.936 --> 12:28.437
I know they look
good, don't they?

12:28.471 --> 12:29.981
No, it's just this
bra that I'm wearing.

12:30.005 --> 12:30.973
Did you want to see them?

12:31.006 --> 12:31.840
Ma.

12:31.874 --> 12:33.543
Okay.

12:33.576 --> 12:34.919
Okay, well, like show
him, like you miss them,

12:34.943 --> 12:35.943
like you want to peek.

12:38.581 --> 12:41.017
Hey, remember when we were all
friends before I grew tits.

12:42.150 --> 12:43.886
All right, well this was fun.

12:43.919 --> 12:45.854
Anyway, do you want to go
shopping for Christmas?

12:45.888 --> 12:49.125
Yeah, oh, I want to hear about
everything about the boys.

12:49.158 --> 12:50.627
I want to hear where
you like to go.

12:50.659 --> 12:51.693
I want to get everything,

12:51.726 --> 12:52.726
- okay?
- Yeah.

13:03.206 --> 13:06.042
Let's get him the
fuck out of here.

13:06.075 --> 13:08.745
Hey frank, let's go get
a drink somewhere, huh?

13:08.778 --> 13:10.447
- Come on, Frankie.
- Come on.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.715
We'll have fun,
you'll have a seltzer.

13:12.748 --> 13:13.750
Let's go.

13:13.783 --> 13:14.884
All right, fine.

13:14.918 --> 13:17.653
Yeah, that's what I'm talking
about Frankie, let's go.

13:26.629 --> 13:28.865
All right, enough with
the fucking talk, okay?

13:34.803 --> 13:35.672
To crystal.

13:35.705 --> 13:37.073
To crystal.

13:37.105 --> 13:38.942
Who knew that accidental orgasm

13:38.975 --> 13:41.177
in a Hampton beach bathroom
would go to fucking college?

13:41.210 --> 13:42.745
If you only pulled
out that night

13:42.778 --> 13:44.089
your whole fucking
life, your whole life

13:44.113 --> 13:44.914
would have been different.

13:44.947 --> 13:45.914
Okay, enough.

13:45.947 --> 13:46.915
Fucking college.

13:46.948 --> 13:49.084
I'm so proud of us, man.

13:49.118 --> 13:50.753
Us, the fuck you ever do?

13:50.785 --> 13:52.254
I did a lot back in the day.

13:52.288 --> 13:54.791
Bullshit, you ever
change a diaper?

13:54.823 --> 13:55.824
You?

13:55.857 --> 13:56.958
What?

13:56.993 --> 13:59.037
I've been changing diapers
since I was nine years old.

13:59.061 --> 14:01.230
My sisters have babies
coming out of their asses.

14:01.264 --> 14:02.798
I love babies.

14:02.831 --> 14:04.668
Everybody fucking
knows this about me.

14:08.004 --> 14:10.572
Look at the blonde at the bar.

14:10.605 --> 14:12.008
Shit, her tits are perfect.

14:12.841 --> 14:14.009
I think it's c-cup.

14:14.043 --> 14:15.110
She's all right.

14:18.880 --> 14:19.880
You okay?

14:20.816 --> 14:22.118
I'm at mcgarvey's.

14:22.150 --> 14:25.087
Of course, yeah,
okay, I'm headed out.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.264
All right, I'll be right there.

14:26.288 --> 14:27.223
Is she okay, frank?

14:27.256 --> 14:30.292
Yeah, she's fine, she
just needs something.

14:30.326 --> 14:33.162
Hey, I tell you
my cough drop thing?

14:33.195 --> 14:38.001
I go up to a girl and
I just start coughing.

14:38.801 --> 14:40.136
Are you listening?

14:41.003 --> 14:43.172
I go up to a girl
and I start coughing

14:43.205 --> 14:44.807
and she gives me a cough drop.

14:47.610 --> 14:48.812
Wait, we hitting on girls?

14:59.020 --> 15:00.856
Sorry.

15:00.889 --> 15:01.889
For what?

15:03.192 --> 15:04.826
I was just kind of staring.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.162
Stare all you fucking want.

15:06.195 --> 15:07.730
I do pilates.

15:10.765 --> 15:11.199
Got a light?

15:11.232 --> 15:13.202
Yeah, I do.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.943
You're a hero.

15:21.844 --> 15:23.688
And I don't even smoke
anymore, I just carry a lighter,

15:23.712 --> 15:25.213
it's like a habit.

15:25.246 --> 15:26.048
It's kind of, it's weird.

15:26.081 --> 15:27.182
It's a great story.

15:29.351 --> 15:30.185
Are you fucking with me?

15:30.219 --> 15:31.321
A little bit, yeah.

15:32.388 --> 15:33.889
I'm a Ducati guy.

15:33.923 --> 15:35.091
My partner's a Ducati guy.

15:35.124 --> 15:37.060
You should see my
Ducati, try to explain

15:37.092 --> 15:38.236
to this gentleman,
I say to him, look,

15:38.260 --> 15:42.064
Ducati is constantly fine
tuning engines for performance.

15:42.097 --> 15:43.231
You can't compare it.

15:43.264 --> 15:45.768
It's like a donkey
with a Jaguar, right?

15:45.801 --> 15:48.204
Seriously, nobody got
a fucking cough drop?

15:48.236 --> 15:50.772
This guy, you know, he's
sitting there, he's like,

15:50.806 --> 15:53.376
you know, he's like a fucking
weekend warrior, right?

15:53.408 --> 15:55.611
Running around like you're
Sonny fucking barger.

15:55.644 --> 15:58.313
Meanwhile, he's probably a
dental hygienist from derry.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.217
That guy was like 70 years old.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.953
Hey look, it's a leprechaun.

16:04.888 --> 16:07.990
Not so good at this whole
flirting thing, are you?

16:08.024 --> 16:08.924
No.

16:08.957 --> 16:09.992
I'm dottie.

16:10.592 --> 16:12.861
Oh, nice to meet you, dottie.

16:12.894 --> 16:13.894
I'm frank.

16:21.003 --> 16:23.139
- Who's this?
- It's my daughter.

16:23.172 --> 16:24.172
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:25.774 --> 16:27.143
Hey, can I
borrow your credit card?

16:27.176 --> 16:29.078
She really is your daughter.

16:29.110 --> 16:30.646
She doesn't have a card?

16:30.679 --> 16:32.948
She maxed it out
shopping for me.

16:32.981 --> 16:34.951
Can I get one of those?

16:34.984 --> 16:35.984
Thanks.

16:38.988 --> 16:40.298
Who carries a light
if he doesn't smoke?

16:40.322 --> 16:41.390
Real fun time this guy.

16:41.423 --> 16:43.793
Huh, you don't
know the half of it.

16:59.107 --> 16:59.941
Oh, hello.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.110
Hello.

17:01.143 --> 17:02.177
Sorry.

17:02.211 --> 17:03.379
Who the fuck are you?

17:03.412 --> 17:06.082
Yeah, I'm just going to go
over there, wait for my uber.

17:07.083 --> 17:10.286
Oh, uber, fancy.

17:10.318 --> 17:11.729
Hey ma, you want to
just wait in the car,

17:11.753 --> 17:13.155
I'm talking to dad for a bit.

17:13.189 --> 17:15.091
Hey just go stay warm.

17:15.124 --> 17:17.360
I'm gonna go pee-pee.

17:22.163 --> 17:23.732
She's fucking wasted.

17:23.766 --> 17:25.735
Yeah, well, she
hasn't eaten yet.

17:25.768 --> 17:27.170
And I'm driving so,

17:27.970 --> 17:30.206
I already know what
you're going to say.

17:30.239 --> 17:32.442
You're gonna tell me that
she doesn't respect me

17:32.474 --> 17:34.076
and that I deserve better.

17:35.478 --> 17:38.381
And you know what, you're right.

17:39.981 --> 17:41.350
But she's still my mother

17:42.151 --> 17:44.688
and I haven't seen
her in a long time.

17:45.954 --> 17:48.724
I just want to
have dinner, okay?

17:53.194 --> 17:55.230
Let me see that.

18:04.405 --> 18:06.241
Don't let her walk away with it.

18:07.876 --> 18:09.846
Oh, I love you, dad.

18:16.184 --> 18:18.754
- Hey.
- Yeah.

18:18.788 --> 18:20.823
You're gonna give my
dad your number or what?

18:20.855 --> 18:21.855
Yeah.

18:24.359 --> 18:25.193
There you go.

18:25.227 --> 18:26.461
Yeah, thanks.

18:26.494 --> 18:28.196
He takes a shot,
you know, I parry it,

18:28.230 --> 18:30.333
I turn over a hot right
hand and pop, pop, pop.

18:30.365 --> 18:32.100
I dropped the fucker, right?

18:32.134 --> 18:33.879
Why do you always gotta
make shit up to sound cool,

18:33.903 --> 18:36.239
swaino, he didn't hit the dude.

18:36.271 --> 18:38.249
How'd you get caught jerking
off in your cousin's panties?

18:38.273 --> 18:39.307
Excuse us.

18:39.340 --> 18:41.042
Point being-

18:41.076 --> 18:42.787
- why you sleep with a he-man
doll until you were 13?

18:42.811 --> 18:45.413
Why do you still live
in your granny's basement?

18:45.446 --> 18:47.983
When we're in the fifth
grade, we had a sleep over

18:48.017 --> 18:50.519
in frank's backyard,
swaino called his parents

18:50.553 --> 18:52.288
at two in the morning
because he pissed

18:52.320 --> 18:53.522
his fucking tightey whiteys.

18:56.592 --> 19:00.062
So his father shows up
says he pees as always,

19:00.095 --> 19:01.998
he called him a pussy
and slaps swaino

19:02.030 --> 19:05.801
across the face and swaino,
he cried like a little bitch.

19:07.303 --> 19:09.272
Dude, he just
bitch slapped that guy.

19:11.574 --> 19:12.976
You all right?

19:17.078 --> 19:18.114
All right.

19:19.381 --> 19:20.950
Packie, listen.

19:22.151 --> 19:23.286
Packie, listen.

19:25.221 --> 19:26.556
I'm sorry.

19:30.459 --> 19:32.260
Take it outside please.

19:32.294 --> 19:34.096
What the fuck are
you laughing at?

19:34.128 --> 19:35.463
Hurt your girlfriends feelings?

19:35.497 --> 19:36.541
Hey why don't you mind
your own fucking business?

19:36.565 --> 19:38.267
Shut the fuck up.

19:38.299 --> 19:38.967
Why don't you mind
your own fucking business

19:39.000 --> 19:40.078
before you get fucking slapped,

19:40.102 --> 19:42.271
you're next, you fucking
string bean motherfucker,

19:42.304 --> 19:43.840
what's the problem?

19:43.873 --> 19:44.807
What about you with
these fucking shoes.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.450
Where the fuck did you
get these from, faggot?

19:46.474 --> 19:47.409
That's homophobic.

19:47.442 --> 19:48.376
Where'd I get the shoes?

19:48.410 --> 19:49.511
Yeah.

19:49.545 --> 19:50.589
I don't know, maybe same
place I fucked your mother,

19:50.613 --> 19:51.480
how about that?

19:51.512 --> 19:52.548
I'm right fucking here.

19:52.580 --> 19:54.349
Stop fucking looking at me.

19:54.383 --> 19:56.485
You wanna fuck me or
you wanna fight me?

19:56.518 --> 19:58.321
I'm right the fuck here.

19:58.354 --> 19:59.889
Don't touch me.

20:08.196 --> 20:10.165
I swear to god, I'll
knock your fucking ass out.

20:10.199 --> 20:11.067
Hey, hey!

20:11.099 --> 20:12.300
Stop it.

20:12.334 --> 20:15.137
Fucking stop it,
back the fuck off.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.073
Now my fucking boy's
here, motherfuckers.

20:17.105 --> 20:18.550
Listen, crystal's
here and I don't want

20:18.574 --> 20:19.942
to get into this shit right now.

20:19.974 --> 20:20.909
Let's go.

20:20.942 --> 20:23.511
All right man, just settle down.

20:23.545 --> 20:25.122
Don't fucking touch me,
bitch, that's my boyfriend.

20:25.146 --> 20:28.384
No, that's my
fucking husband, bitch.

20:28.416 --> 20:29.618
Fuck you, bitch.

20:48.569 --> 20:50.272
Kick his ass
frank, whoop his ass.

20:50.306 --> 20:53.509
Fuck him up, hit him.

21:01.349 --> 21:02.349
Hey frank,

21:03.685 --> 21:06.154
Frankie enough.

21:06.188 --> 21:07.556
Frank.

21:07.588 --> 21:09.524
Frank, you're gonna
kill him, Frankie.

21:09.557 --> 21:10.657
Daddy stop!

21:16.265 --> 21:17.265
Crystal.

21:27.409 --> 21:28.010
Come on, Frankie, let's go.

21:28.042 --> 21:29.945
Don't fucking touch me.

21:31.046 --> 21:32.548
I fucking knew this
was gonna happen.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.349
Hey, hey, hey, Frankie.

21:34.916 --> 21:38.487
You stay away from me and
you stay away from my family.

21:40.588 --> 21:44.159
I don't want to see again I
don't want to ever fucking

21:44.192 --> 21:45.493
see you again.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.137
Come on, we gotta go.

23:02.671 --> 23:03.671
Come on.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.775
You got another text from frank.

23:40.808 --> 23:42.711
Again, fuck him.

23:42.743 --> 23:45.080
I think it's sad, they've
been friends forever.

23:48.416 --> 23:50.151
What's the text say?

23:57.492 --> 23:58.528
Jesus.

23:59.260 --> 24:00.462
Jesus Christ.

24:01.529 --> 24:03.865
I'm coming, Frankie.

24:03.898 --> 24:05.700
He wants you to come by tonight.

24:05.733 --> 24:07.535
He's hiring strippers
as an apology.

24:07.568 --> 24:10.138
Frank romanowski is
hiring strippers, fuck him.

24:10.172 --> 24:11.315
He's extending an
olive branch here.

24:11.339 --> 24:13.576
It's a fucking
sexist olive branch.

24:13.608 --> 24:14.776
Suck a tiny dick, Judy.

24:14.809 --> 24:17.745
If you don't know how important
this is to our baby brother-

24:17.778 --> 24:18.413
- what if I don't want to go?

24:18.446 --> 24:20.648
Stop being a fucking pussy.

25:23.444 --> 25:24.480
Frankie.

25:27.281 --> 25:28.317
Frankie.

25:38.759 --> 25:40.796
Okay, just let it out.

25:41.797 --> 25:45.800
All right, your brain, your
lungs, what stage is it?

25:45.834 --> 25:46.869
Does that hurt?

25:47.970 --> 25:49.805
Does your dick still work?

25:49.837 --> 25:50.873
I don't have cancer.

25:52.007 --> 25:53.007
What the fuck?

25:53.875 --> 25:56.744
So are you mad at me
for not having cancer?

25:56.778 --> 26:00.915
I, you know my cousin Larry
died from fucking lymphoma.

26:00.949 --> 26:03.485
Hey, where'd you get your TV?

26:03.518 --> 26:04.553
Costco.

26:04.586 --> 26:05.653
How much was it?

26:05.686 --> 26:07.522
I don't remember.

26:07.556 --> 26:09.225
It's nice.

26:09.258 --> 26:12.294
Oh Jesus Christ, we haven't
seen each other in months

26:12.326 --> 26:14.596
and the first thing you
do is fucking lie to me.

26:14.630 --> 26:17.833
All right, look,
you're to promise me

26:17.865 --> 26:19.535
you're not going to freak out.

26:19.567 --> 26:20.603
What?

26:22.037 --> 26:23.338
Swaino's coming over.

26:26.642 --> 26:28.009
Here?

26:28.042 --> 26:28.644
No, he's going to
the stop & shop

26:28.676 --> 26:30.411
to buy a fucking sandwich.

26:30.444 --> 26:31.444
Of course, here.

26:32.413 --> 26:33.848
I don't want to
see that asshole.

26:33.882 --> 26:35.750
Because he slapped you?

26:35.784 --> 26:37.853
A slap is insult and
it's not the first time

26:37.885 --> 26:39.788
in our history that
happened either.

26:39.820 --> 26:40.855
It's like the 11th time.

26:40.888 --> 26:41.689
Okay, come on.

26:41.722 --> 26:43.558
No, you come on.

26:43.592 --> 26:44.869
You should be mad
at me and not him.

26:44.893 --> 26:47.462
No, I'm mad at the
both of you, frank.

26:47.496 --> 26:49.698
Three months, nobody
fucking calls me,

26:49.730 --> 26:51.267
I'm wasting away.

26:51.299 --> 26:53.935
Okay, so you're gonna
ride this shitty bmx by him

26:53.969 --> 26:55.837
and give him ammunition
to bust your balls

26:55.871 --> 26:57.673
for the next hundred
fucking years.

27:04.613 --> 27:05.748
Is that what you want?

27:09.917 --> 27:10.952
Hey.

27:13.087 --> 27:16.057
Packie, hey, packie,
that's the closet.

27:16.090 --> 27:18.793
No shit, I know it's the closet.

27:37.746 --> 27:38.980
How are you doing, man?

27:39.013 --> 27:41.750
It's really good to finally

27:41.782 --> 27:42.950
good to see you.

27:42.983 --> 27:47.022
I'm sorry, I just, I can't
quite make out what you saying.

27:48.656 --> 27:52.595
It's good to.

27:58.967 --> 27:59.967
Fuck this.

28:01.936 --> 28:02.936
Fuck you.

28:30.164 --> 28:34.703
Aw, yeah.

28:40.709 --> 28:41.718
You seem a little bit tense.

28:41.742 --> 28:43.010
It's work shit.

28:43.044 --> 28:44.847
- Yeah?
- How are you doing?

28:46.480 --> 28:47.817
Got blown an hour ago.

28:49.651 --> 28:50.820
Where's my guy?

28:51.619 --> 28:52.987
Where's my guy?

28:53.888 --> 28:56.724
Oh, oh, could you be here?

28:56.758 --> 28:57.960
Could you be here?

28:59.493 --> 29:00.795
There's my guy.

29:00.828 --> 29:02.798
There's my baby boy.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.601
Look at my baby boy.

29:06.167 --> 29:07.167
Oh!

29:09.570 --> 29:10.772
Who's my guy?

29:11.673 --> 29:12.842
Oh yes, oh yes.

29:13.741 --> 29:15.911
Who's my sexy man?

29:15.943 --> 29:18.846
Did I miss you so fucking much?

29:18.880 --> 29:20.549
God, I missed this man.

29:21.715 --> 29:22.850
You got a new TV, huh?

29:22.884 --> 29:24.019
I did.

29:24.051 --> 29:27.055
Yeah, mine's bigger,
but that's good.

29:30.057 --> 29:31.192
What the fuck was that?

29:33.894 --> 29:34.896
What's that?

29:55.217 --> 29:56.919
So you got a chihuahua?

29:56.951 --> 29:58.653
Hardy har.

29:58.686 --> 30:01.055
Surprised, you
spent all that money

30:01.088 --> 30:03.759
on a designer Mexican toy breed.

30:03.791 --> 30:05.894
If I'm a chihuahua then
you're a fucking corgi.

30:05.926 --> 30:07.896
Was that a fucking burn, packie?

30:08.830 --> 30:10.898
You see, you got to one
up me with a smaller dog.

30:10.932 --> 30:12.468
A corgi is a smaller dog.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.878
A corgi's practically
regular size dog.

30:13.902 --> 30:15.971
They just got wicked short legs.

30:16.003 --> 30:18.840
Should have said like
a Yorkshire terrier.

30:18.874 --> 30:20.918
A Yorkshire aint smaller than
a chihuahua, I should know,

30:20.942 --> 30:22.912
me and my grammy
used to have one.

30:23.578 --> 30:25.847
What do you mean,
fucking falcor?

30:26.682 --> 30:29.084
That maniac was a fucking
Maltese and it was a mix.

30:29.116 --> 30:30.051
- He was not.
- He had white

30:30.085 --> 30:31.262
fucking fur and Jesus, packie.

30:31.286 --> 30:34.690
Trading barbs with you is like
throwing rocks at a retard.

30:34.722 --> 30:37.960
Hey, he knows my uncle Gary
has fucking down syndrome.

30:37.992 --> 30:39.028
You're right.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.496
Should've said
trading barbs with you

30:41.529 --> 30:43.699
was like throwing rocks
at your uncle Gary.

30:43.731 --> 30:45.666
Knock it off,
swaino, knock it off.

30:45.700 --> 30:46.334
Ain't knockin' shit off.

30:46.367 --> 30:48.002
Fuck this fucking leprechaun.

30:48.036 --> 30:50.806
As an Irish American, I
fucking take offense to that.

30:50.838 --> 30:52.716
What does that even
fucking mean I'm half Irish.

30:52.740 --> 30:54.710
Exactly, you're
a fucking traitor

30:56.644 --> 30:58.012
you're magically delicious.

30:58.046 --> 30:59.189
All right, all right, all right.

30:59.213 --> 31:01.082
Knock it the fuck off, okay?

31:01.115 --> 31:02.115
Come here, come here.

31:03.151 --> 31:06.587
Can't let 30 years of history
go down the fucking toilet

31:06.621 --> 31:08.524
over some fucking bullshit.

31:09.458 --> 31:11.034
What the fuck are you
talking about, frank,

31:11.058 --> 31:12.270
you're the one that
said you were done.

31:12.294 --> 31:13.961
Yeah, frank.

31:13.994 --> 31:16.564
I know, and I was wrong.

31:16.597 --> 31:17.597
All right?

31:19.834 --> 31:20.834
Okay.

31:24.071 --> 31:25.807
Yeah, let's do it.

31:28.042 --> 31:29.043
How are we doing this?

31:29.076 --> 31:30.612
What time do they get here?

31:30.644 --> 31:32.013
Who, who's getting here?

31:32.047 --> 31:33.315
The strippers.

31:33.347 --> 31:35.182
What strippers?

31:35.215 --> 31:35.883
What do you mean what strippers,

31:35.916 --> 31:36.994
frank fucking ordered strippers.

31:37.018 --> 31:37.685
How are we doing this?

31:37.719 --> 31:39.020
Frank, you ordered strippers?

31:40.622 --> 31:41.789
There's no strippers coming.

31:46.060 --> 31:47.604
What do you mean there's
no strippers coming?

31:47.628 --> 31:49.865
I stopped, I got 30 fucking
dollars in singles here.

31:49.897 --> 31:51.567
You lied to him too, frank?

31:52.300 --> 31:54.235
The hell is going
on here, frank?

31:54.269 --> 31:56.637
I got fucking plans tonight,
I got fucking friends.

31:56.671 --> 31:57.838
We ain't friends?

31:57.872 --> 31:59.207
No, I mean like adult friends,

31:59.240 --> 32:00.208
not fucking childhood friends.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.609
We're adults, we're adults.

32:01.643 --> 32:03.010
You're in your 40s, packie.

32:03.044 --> 32:04.846
What is that?

32:04.878 --> 32:06.998
That's like nursery school
age for leprechauns, right?

32:17.092 --> 32:18.193
Get off me.

32:42.017 --> 32:43.852
When did you start
drinking again?

32:43.884 --> 32:44.920
Today.

32:46.421 --> 32:47.421
Why?

32:48.923 --> 32:51.926
- I'm sick and tired-
- 'cause I'm just curious.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.028
I have feelings.

32:53.060 --> 32:54.905
I come from a long line
of proud Irish immigrants.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.832
My people have been
oppressed by white people

32:56.865 --> 32:59.067
for far too long to be
putting up with this

32:59.099 --> 33:00.267
and marginalized.

33:00.300 --> 33:02.236
But you fuckers that
I call my friends.

33:02.269 --> 33:04.772
Made fun of and fucking
laugh, what, what?

33:07.709 --> 33:09.076
Don't fucking laugh.

33:09.109 --> 33:10.378
Listen to you.

33:10.412 --> 33:11.988
You're right, you're
right, you're right.

33:12.012 --> 33:13.012
I know I'm right.

33:14.415 --> 33:15.415
Hey, hey.

33:17.786 --> 33:18.821
Hey,

33:21.288 --> 33:22.290
you okay?

33:29.130 --> 33:31.099
Yeah, I'm okay, yeah.

33:31.132 --> 33:32.968
- You good?
- Yeah.

33:34.001 --> 33:35.436
All right, listen.

33:35.470 --> 33:39.040
I got steaks, I got
booze, I got beer.

33:39.074 --> 33:42.076
The fight on pay-per-view,
we are hanging out tonight.

33:44.445 --> 33:45.445
You in?

33:52.353 --> 33:54.123
Yeah, I'll watch a fight.

33:55.155 --> 33:56.424
Me too, I can do it.

33:56.458 --> 33:58.427
Me too, I'll stay for the fight.

33:58.460 --> 34:01.430
Hey, I got a surprise
for you pussies.

34:07.902 --> 34:09.737
What the fuck, bro?

34:09.771 --> 34:12.140
That's the holy
grail right there.

34:12.172 --> 34:13.140
Ah!

34:13.173 --> 34:15.342
He's right there he's
got fight, fight, fight.

34:15.376 --> 34:17.079
Choke that motherfucker out.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.849
I fucking can't
fucking look at it.

34:21.382 --> 34:22.451
Hey frank.

34:22.483 --> 34:23.918
Hey, to friendship.

34:23.952 --> 34:24.986
- Hey.
- Frank.

34:25.018 --> 34:25.920
Right?

34:25.954 --> 34:27.422
Thank you frank.

34:27.454 --> 34:30.192
Aw, god is that fucking good.

34:30.992 --> 34:33.161
How's your grandma doing?

34:33.193 --> 34:34.896
Oh, she's amazing.

34:34.929 --> 34:36.331
How the fuck old
is she now anyway?

34:36.364 --> 34:38.166
99, can you believe it?

34:38.934 --> 34:40.502
Remember the time in third grade

34:40.534 --> 34:42.103
when we all seen her a bush.

34:44.105 --> 34:44.706
Remember that?

34:44.739 --> 34:46.374
We come walking downstairs,

34:46.407 --> 34:48.477
she's cooking flap
Jacks, she turns around,

34:48.510 --> 34:50.378
what do you know,
Frankie, no pants.

34:50.411 --> 34:52.313
You know that's the
first real bush I ever saw.

34:52.347 --> 34:54.449
Why the fuck you always
got to bring that up?

34:54.481 --> 34:56.751
Packie, how do you
not bring that up?

34:57.885 --> 34:59.954
Like a fucking
baby gray squirrel.

35:04.092 --> 35:05.026
To your grandma.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.228
To baby gray squirrels.

35:10.565 --> 35:12.300
You know when I
took that picture?

35:13.235 --> 35:16.403
Frank's small engine repair
signature fucking image.

35:16.436 --> 35:20.208
I mean rarely does an image
capture someone's personality

35:20.240 --> 35:22.443
so good. God, is she beautiful?

35:23.378 --> 35:25.421
Hey frank, you know something,
I oughta get residuals

35:25.445 --> 35:26.847
for that fucking picture.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.382
You're drinking your residuals.

35:39.059 --> 35:39.494
What are you doing?

35:39.527 --> 35:40.829
Wait.

35:40.862 --> 35:42.164
Is this really for me.

35:42.197 --> 35:44.065
That's just enough for you,

35:44.097 --> 35:47.835
where's your daddy?

35:47.869 --> 35:49.171
Happy birthday.

35:49.204 --> 35:50.939
Because I'm six?

35:50.972 --> 35:53.441
You're now six years
old, you need your own man.

35:53.474 --> 35:55.544
Hey swaino, hit the light.

35:55.577 --> 35:58.079
Yeah, you got it.

35:58.112 --> 35:59.523
Look at the lights,
look at the lights.

35:59.547 --> 36:01.083
So beautiful.

36:02.317 --> 36:03.585
One, two, three, dismount.

36:03.617 --> 36:05.453
Give her like a
tool or something.

36:06.121 --> 36:07.389
Look who's the most beautiful.

36:07.422 --> 36:08.456
Look at you.

36:08.489 --> 36:10.092
- Perfect.
- Make a smile.

36:10.925 --> 36:13.128
Tell her you got a
future or something.

36:13.628 --> 36:15.096
Oh, look at this.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.969
Oh, we got it, we got
it, that's so good.

36:22.070 --> 36:25.140
Hey come on, come
on, up, up, up.

36:25.907 --> 36:28.109
The moment we've
been waiting for.

36:28.141 --> 36:29.385
I think about telling
crystal, when she goes to ucla,

36:29.409 --> 36:31.011
she should get a
degree in marketing

36:31.045 --> 36:32.581
or technology or something.

36:32.614 --> 36:34.282
The fuck do you know about it?

36:34.315 --> 36:35.492
It's called social networking.

36:35.516 --> 36:37.085
My ball's got social networking.

36:37.117 --> 36:38.117
Fuck you.

36:39.152 --> 36:41.455
I bet your phone don't
even have apps on it.

36:41.489 --> 36:43.525
Check this shit out.

36:43.557 --> 36:46.061
That's the galaxy s9, bitch.

36:46.094 --> 36:48.463
I got everything on this
little fucking gadget.

36:48.496 --> 36:50.331
I got the fucking Google.

36:50.364 --> 36:51.432
I got Facebook.

36:51.465 --> 36:52.601
I got the weather.

36:52.634 --> 36:55.135
That's not an s9, that's an s6.

36:55.168 --> 36:56.347
The fuck you talking
about, its an s9,

36:56.371 --> 36:57.505
I just fucking bought it.

36:57.538 --> 36:59.240
Yeah, an s9 has a bigger screen.

37:00.307 --> 37:03.010
You're like a fucking Asian
teenager, you know that?

37:03.043 --> 37:04.483
How many Instagram
followers you got?

37:04.512 --> 37:05.555
How much can you
fucking bench press?

37:05.579 --> 37:07.081
Frank bench presses
more than you.

37:07.114 --> 37:08.258
"Frank bench presses
more than you."

37:08.282 --> 37:11.152
Does frank fucking bench
press more than you?

37:11.184 --> 37:12.586
I'm just wondering
if frank benches

37:12.619 --> 37:15.589
more fucking weight than you.

37:15.623 --> 37:16.657
I'm just wondering.

37:16.690 --> 37:19.493
I hope you saved your receipt.

37:21.561 --> 37:24.098
Hey frank, let's fucking eat.

37:24.132 --> 37:24.932
You know what I mean?

37:24.965 --> 37:26.166
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

37:26.199 --> 37:28.903
You guys want to hear
some crazy fucking shit?

37:28.936 --> 37:31.205
You guys remember it was
like a couple of summers,

37:31.239 --> 37:33.074
it was at crystal's
birthday party.

37:33.106 --> 37:34.208
Remember at the landmark.

37:34.242 --> 37:35.419
Remember how I
brought that chick?

37:35.443 --> 37:37.612
She's like 26 years old
from fucking pelham.

37:37.644 --> 37:38.512
Pakistani girl.

37:38.545 --> 37:39.547
That fucking Pakistani.

37:39.579 --> 37:40.648
Afnahn was her name.

37:40.681 --> 37:42.116
That's the fucking one.

37:42.150 --> 37:44.251
We had a great
discussion on Reza aslan.

37:44.284 --> 37:45.524
Hey wait, the fucking point is,

37:45.552 --> 37:47.554
we kind of lost touch, right?

37:47.588 --> 37:49.557
Couple of weeks
ago, I'm going out

37:49.590 --> 37:50.934
with a couple of
buddies from work.

37:50.958 --> 37:52.436
We're getting fucking
hammered and unlike

37:52.460 --> 37:54.128
you pussies, these
motherfuckers, they go.

37:54.161 --> 37:56.230
I mean, they fucking go, right?

37:56.264 --> 37:58.133
Old friends and new friends.

37:58.166 --> 38:00.135
Big love to family.

38:00.168 --> 38:03.405
Let me get a drink,
let me get a drink.

38:03.438 --> 38:05.440
Hey, hey, big
fucking love, right?

38:06.440 --> 38:07.574
To family.

38:07.608 --> 38:09.443
And who do I see across the bar?

38:09.476 --> 38:12.313
It's fucking afnahn, she's
there, she's making eyes at me.

38:12.347 --> 38:15.384
So I'm like, hey, it's time
to fucking get to work, right?

38:17.585 --> 38:19.454
I walk over, I'm like, hello?

38:19.487 --> 38:22.356
Hello, this is unbelievable.

38:22.389 --> 38:23.724
How are you?

38:23.757 --> 38:25.559
And this fucking
chick, she pretends

38:25.592 --> 38:26.704
that she doesn't remember me.

38:26.728 --> 38:27.728
Do I know you?

38:29.597 --> 38:31.132
Yeah.

38:31.164 --> 38:32.408
She gives me like
this fake name.

38:32.432 --> 38:33.668
I'm Judy.

38:33.701 --> 38:35.637
So I'm like, fuck it,
I give her a fake name.

38:35.670 --> 38:39.240
Fuck it I'm Eddie, right?

38:39.273 --> 38:40.275
Hello?

38:40.307 --> 38:41.242
Hello Judy.

38:41.275 --> 38:42.744
- Hi Eddie.
- Hi.

38:42.777 --> 38:43.711
Nice to meet you.

38:43.744 --> 38:46.447
Wow, it is nice to meet you.

38:46.481 --> 38:50.018
And then I realize what
this tricky girl is up to,

38:50.050 --> 38:53.554
she's playing like one of
these fucking sex games, right?

38:53.588 --> 38:54.698
I have to be honest with you,

38:54.722 --> 38:55.657
it's fucking turning
me on, right?

38:55.690 --> 38:59.193
So I make up this whole
fake backstory, right?

38:59.226 --> 39:00.537
I'm like from
fucking Connecticut.

39:00.561 --> 39:02.297
I'm from fucking Connecticut.

39:03.463 --> 39:04.532
I like rowing.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.202
She's eating it up.

39:07.235 --> 39:08.611
We hang out, we're
getting hammered.

39:08.635 --> 39:11.605
We go back to our place
and oh my god, oh my god.

39:11.639 --> 39:13.141
The fucking performance,

39:13.173 --> 39:14.617
there's something about
being a character.

39:14.641 --> 39:16.677
I'm the fucking
heavyweight champ, right?

39:16.710 --> 39:19.747
She passes out, I fucking
pass out, great night, right?

39:19.780 --> 39:21.750
I wake up the next
morning and I'm a mess.

39:21.782 --> 39:22.717
I'm hung over as shit.

39:22.751 --> 39:26.153
And I take a look at her
in the morning light.

39:26.186 --> 39:29.356
I can get you a car, show
you where the bus stop is.

39:29.389 --> 39:32.292
I can give you a ride,
whatever works for you.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.463
Is that my shirt?

39:35.829 --> 39:37.398
And I look.

39:37.431 --> 39:39.466
It finally fucking dawns on me.

39:39.500 --> 39:40.668
It's a different girl.

39:45.739 --> 39:47.207
Hey, how did you know that?

39:47.240 --> 39:48.809
Afnahn, she got engaged.

39:48.842 --> 39:51.478
Me and her, we follow
each other on insta.

39:51.512 --> 39:53.648
That is some vintage
fucking Terrance swaino shit

39:53.681 --> 39:54.648
right there.

39:54.681 --> 39:55.817
Ah, here we go, here we go.

39:55.849 --> 39:57.652
You got to fucking
judge me, frank.

39:57.684 --> 39:59.662
When's the last time you
went on a fucking date, huh?

39:59.686 --> 40:00.788
Matter of fact-

40:02.722 --> 40:03.657
oh shit, i-

40:03.690 --> 40:04.657
- what do you mean, hold on.

40:04.659 --> 40:07.662
Tell us the story, who is it?

40:07.695 --> 40:09.264
It's crystal.

40:09.297 --> 40:10.632
Tell her we said aye.

40:10.664 --> 40:11.800
Let me talk to her.

40:11.833 --> 40:14.702
This could take two seconds,
keep an eye on the meat.

40:14.735 --> 40:16.104
Keep an eye on the meat.

40:16.137 --> 40:18.673
I've got to keep
an eye on the meat.

40:18.706 --> 40:20.575
Hey frank, my eye's on the meat.

40:21.509 --> 40:24.079
It's just not worth
the amount we're talking about.

40:24.112 --> 40:25.579
Okay, hey look, I
totally get it man.

40:25.612 --> 40:26.847
Let's just double it.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.284
Double it,
are you serious, okay?

40:30.318 --> 40:33.121
♪ I'm hanging with my man,
packie, who looks like an owl ♪

40:33.153 --> 40:35.657
♪ you know my man packie
got a dick like a yard ♪

40:35.690 --> 40:37.559
I'll hit you up
when I'm on the road.

40:37.592 --> 40:38.592
All right man, thanks.

40:49.536 --> 40:51.138
Let me ask you something, man.

40:52.039 --> 40:55.877
All this fucking
Instagram shit, you know.

40:55.909 --> 40:57.545
I don't know,
maybe you can like,

40:58.079 --> 40:59.681
show me how that shit works.

40:59.713 --> 41:02.549
Everybody's getting
laid that way these days.

41:02.583 --> 41:03.583
Are you?

41:04.619 --> 41:05.720
Who, me?

41:09.923 --> 41:11.626
Let me see your phone.

41:11.659 --> 41:12.659
Hey, give me your phone.

41:20.467 --> 41:22.302
You just, you take a pic.

41:22.335 --> 41:23.671
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

41:26.574 --> 41:29.744
And then you just, you
open your Instagram app.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.856
Where's your app, you
don't have any apps.

41:33.880 --> 41:35.616
Fucking stop with the apps.

41:35.650 --> 41:37.853
There it is, good.

41:38.420 --> 41:41.590
Then you pick a cool filter.

41:42.789 --> 41:45.492
Sepia makes it
look artsy, right?

41:45.525 --> 41:47.394
Fuck, I didn't know
you could do that.

41:47.427 --> 41:50.330
And then you go here
and you press this.

41:50.364 --> 41:51.798
You go there and you press that.

41:51.831 --> 41:54.902
Is there a filter you can
use to get the tiny homo

41:54.936 --> 41:56.238
out of the picture?

41:57.637 --> 41:59.641
I can tell you think
it's cool, swaino.

42:01.474 --> 42:02.844
Then I tag the location.

42:04.644 --> 42:09.317
So everybody knows we're at
frank's shop together, right?

42:16.724 --> 42:18.559
Who the fuck is this?

42:19.092 --> 42:20.928
Karen delgado's calling you.

42:20.961 --> 42:21.896
Why the fuck is
Karen calling you?

42:21.929 --> 42:24.798
Hey, give me
my fucking phone back.

42:24.831 --> 42:26.366
Is Karen back in town?

42:26.400 --> 42:28.211
Yeah, she's back in town,
just give me the phone.

42:28.235 --> 42:28.769
Are you banging Karen?

42:28.802 --> 42:29.804
Why would you fucking,

42:29.836 --> 42:31.371
what's the matter with you?

42:31.405 --> 42:32.673
Why would she fucking call you?

42:33.608 --> 42:35.310
Just fucking stop.

42:35.342 --> 42:36.377
We had coffee.

42:39.646 --> 42:41.248
- How's the meat?
- It's good.

42:41.282 --> 42:43.385
- It's good.
- Yeah.

42:53.860 --> 42:56.663
- Two more minutes.
- Good.

42:56.697 --> 42:58.298
35 years old.

42:58.331 --> 43:02.237
Divorcee from derry, she's
got this four year old son.

43:02.269 --> 43:05.539
So we go on this date and
still is fucking depressing.

43:07.474 --> 43:09.677
She had wicked big tits.

43:09.710 --> 43:11.278
Go on, sir.

43:11.311 --> 43:13.815
So, we end up back at her place.

43:13.847 --> 43:15.949
- Thanks for the dinner.
- It's like

43:15.983 --> 43:17.519
maybe our third date.

43:18.552 --> 43:20.755
There you are, thanks very much.

43:25.893 --> 43:27.595
You want to come inside?

43:27.628 --> 43:28.763
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:28.795 --> 43:31.531
I go inside, she
pays the babysitter.

43:31.565 --> 43:33.300
How'd he do?

43:33.333 --> 43:35.769
You know, punched me in
the face a couple of times.

43:35.802 --> 43:37.337
You want me to walk you home?

43:37.371 --> 43:39.273
It's just next door.

43:39.306 --> 43:42.776
The sitter goes home and
then we go into her bedroom.

43:43.376 --> 43:45.480
You haven't drunk a lot, huh?

43:50.083 --> 43:52.786
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

43:53.487 --> 43:56.590
She tells me she has
not been with a guy

43:56.623 --> 43:57.759
since her kid was born.

43:58.858 --> 43:59.994
So she's all over me.

44:06.634 --> 44:10.304
She takes my hand and she
pushes it into her pants.

44:11.105 --> 44:15.777
She, I shit you not,
has got a huge, unkempt,

44:15.809 --> 44:18.913
like 1970s playboy bush.

44:21.849 --> 44:22.917
My watch gets stuck there.

44:22.949 --> 44:24.818
Oh, stop kidding.

44:25.920 --> 44:27.822
- Relax, let's be careful.
- Oh.

44:29.923 --> 44:31.858
Oh my god, it's your watch.

44:32.992 --> 44:34.362
So I pulled my hand out.

44:34.394 --> 44:35.539
She goes, "I'm really
embarrassed, frank."

44:35.563 --> 44:36.798
I was gonna trim.

44:36.831 --> 44:39.534
No, it's okay, it's fine.

44:39.567 --> 44:40.601
Yeah?

44:40.634 --> 44:41.735
Yeah, yeah.

44:41.768 --> 44:44.971
We just start laughing,
fucking laughing our asses off.

44:45.005 --> 44:45.873
Kind of fun.

44:45.905 --> 44:47.041
We're just laughing.

44:47.074 --> 44:48.617
But it was so loud that
we wake up the kid.

44:48.641 --> 44:53.080
Momma, come get me, I'm scared.

44:53.114 --> 44:55.682
So she gets off
the bed and she says-

44:55.715 --> 44:57.461
- I'll be back, I just
have to put him to sleep.

44:57.485 --> 44:58.586
Totally, go.

44:58.619 --> 45:01.789
Being a single
parent, it ain't easy.

45:03.523 --> 45:05.092
So, she says, hey-

45:05.126 --> 45:06.528
- still want to fuck?

45:08.461 --> 45:09.396
Yeah, I'd love to.

45:09.429 --> 45:11.332
Of course I still want to fuck.

45:12.666 --> 45:15.836
Oh, good, I'm
looking forward to it.

45:18.005 --> 45:21.976
So then she leaves and
I'm lying there, in her bed,

45:22.009 --> 45:24.010
for like half an hour.

45:24.043 --> 45:27.382
My hard on is a distant
fucking memory at this point.

45:27.414 --> 45:29.583
So I get up and I
go down the hallway.

45:36.958 --> 45:41.930
And I see she's lying there
on this like race car bed,

45:42.963 --> 45:43.965
asleep with her son.

45:49.170 --> 45:51.072
So I watched for a
couple of minutes.

45:53.139 --> 45:54.675
It was kind of a
sweet image, you know.

45:58.945 --> 46:01.482
A mom like that
with a kid like that

46:04.717 --> 46:05.997
is the way everything should be.

46:10.757 --> 46:11.792
So,

46:13.927 --> 46:15.596
I let myself out, I go home

46:16.896 --> 46:18.065
and I watched TV.

46:22.735 --> 46:24.071
Never heard from her again.

46:26.706 --> 46:29.143
You ever consider
killing yourself.

46:29.175 --> 46:30.911
That's a beautiful story, frank.

46:31.846 --> 46:33.447
Tragic, but beautiful.

46:33.481 --> 46:35.116
The fuck is so
beautiful about it?

46:36.117 --> 46:37.994
Frank doesn't think he can
be of value in a relationship

46:38.018 --> 46:41.121
unless they're broken
and he could fix them.

46:41.155 --> 46:43.925
Like Karen, she's
in pieces, right?

46:43.958 --> 46:46.626
She's humpty dumpty always
need something to be fixing.

46:46.659 --> 46:47.937
This woman, she had
her life together,

46:47.961 --> 46:48.972
frank didn't know
what to do with her

46:48.996 --> 46:52.000
so he just let himself out.

46:53.766 --> 46:55.869
Are you done, can we eat?

46:57.570 --> 46:58.605
Eat your food.

47:03.010 --> 47:04.612
Frank, Karen's back in town.

47:07.248 --> 47:08.215
How did you know that?

47:08.248 --> 47:09.349
So you knew?

47:09.384 --> 47:10.861
She's the mother of my
child, you don't think I'd know

47:10.885 --> 47:12.720
she's in manch-Vegas?

47:12.753 --> 47:13.788
Yeah.

47:14.621 --> 47:15.956
You seen her?

47:15.989 --> 47:16.989
Why does it matter?

47:20.260 --> 47:21.896
Fucking cycle begins.

47:25.065 --> 47:26.634
Enough.

47:26.666 --> 47:28.144
Well, I'm sorry, are
supposed to be happy

47:28.168 --> 47:29.704
that Karen is back in town?

47:29.737 --> 47:32.807
Gee, I can't wait to deal
with your anger issues again.

47:32.840 --> 47:35.142
You don't got to
deal with shit anymore

47:35.175 --> 47:37.153
because you got your new
fucking work friends, right?

47:37.177 --> 47:39.579
God, for fuck's
sake, don't do that.

47:39.612 --> 47:42.082
Look all I'm saying is
Karen's fucking toxic.

47:42.115 --> 47:43.818
It's what she does.

47:43.851 --> 47:45.952
Swoops in, she plays the
wife, she plays the mother,

47:45.985 --> 47:48.655
she pulls you in and she
tears you the fuck apart.

47:48.688 --> 47:50.991
And you go on a bender,
start throwing strangers

47:51.025 --> 47:53.094
she flirts with through
plate-glass fucking windows

47:53.126 --> 47:55.061
and I get to stay up
with crystal all night.

47:55.094 --> 47:57.664
Tell her her father
ain't going back to jail.

47:59.032 --> 48:01.268
This is shit you know,
even crystal knows it.

48:01.302 --> 48:02.803
All right?

48:02.835 --> 48:04.014
There are two
things in your life

48:04.038 --> 48:05.247
that consistently fuck
you up, it's Karen,

48:05.271 --> 48:07.040
and it's your fucking temper.

48:07.074 --> 48:08.184
I mean, think about
it, you live your life,

48:08.208 --> 48:10.810
you've got a daughter who
spends half the fucking time

48:10.844 --> 48:11.811
being terrified of you.

48:11.844 --> 48:12.844
That's just a fact.

48:17.318 --> 48:20.821
At least I accepted
responsibility for raising my kid

48:20.853 --> 48:22.289
instead of sticking
my diseased cock

48:22.322 --> 48:24.725
in a bunch of half
dumb fucking girls.

48:30.764 --> 48:32.724
What do you want to do,
frank, you want to hit me?

48:36.369 --> 48:38.806
You want to hit me just
because I told you the truth?

48:43.077 --> 48:44.077
Fuck it, I love you.

48:45.612 --> 48:48.015
And I hate what she does to
you. I hate fucking watching it.

48:48.516 --> 48:50.617
So yeah, I fucking hate her.

48:50.650 --> 48:52.061
All right, I hate what
she fucking does to you.

48:52.085 --> 48:53.930
So if I fucking said
something that makes you want

48:53.954 --> 48:56.925
to fucking bash by skull
in then just do it, frank.

48:58.157 --> 48:59.960
I'm just fucking
being honest with you.

48:59.994 --> 49:01.129
So go ahead.

49:01.929 --> 49:03.298
I'm right fucking here.

49:04.065 --> 49:07.233
At least I know I said
my piece, I'm here.

49:10.903 --> 49:13.139
Hey frank, it could
be crystal again.

49:13.172 --> 49:15.208
Maybe you want to get that.

49:17.010 --> 49:18.045
I can get it.

49:18.077 --> 49:22.083
No, no, no, I'll get it.

49:32.126 --> 49:33.628
Hey, what's up, it's frank.

49:35.396 --> 49:39.133
Yeah, you just, you just keep
going on 93 north for awhile

49:39.166 --> 49:42.702
and then you you'll take
the mammoth road exit,

49:42.735 --> 49:45.271
just gonna go like four miles,
you know, it'll bring you

49:45.304 --> 49:47.707
around and you know, you'll
see my shop kind of tucked away

49:47.740 --> 49:49.809
there on the left and
see, it's the only place

49:49.842 --> 49:50.944
that has light on.

49:50.978 --> 49:52.680
All right, man.

49:52.713 --> 49:54.215
I'll see you soon.

50:03.891 --> 50:04.925
Hey,

50:06.994 --> 50:07.994
I'm sorry.

50:11.931 --> 50:12.931
For what?

50:22.175 --> 50:23.677
For calling your cock diseased.

50:27.146 --> 50:28.146
I'm sorry.

50:32.219 --> 50:36.691
By the way I mean just,
with that, you know,

50:36.724 --> 50:38.292
I did take a needle
for that situation.

50:38.324 --> 50:41.361
So I just kind of feel
like if you are going

50:41.394 --> 50:44.331
to make fun of my cock,
like refer to it as like

50:44.364 --> 50:45.733
as a formerly diseased cock,

50:45.766 --> 50:47.335
I'm just saying
you should do that.

50:49.335 --> 50:50.335
Deal.

50:51.271 --> 50:52.907
All right.

50:52.940 --> 50:54.409
All right, frank.

50:55.809 --> 50:56.978
Let me clean this shit up.

50:57.577 --> 50:59.179
Who's coming over, frank?

51:01.047 --> 51:02.082
Oh, this kid.

51:03.483 --> 51:05.085
What kid?

51:05.119 --> 51:07.188
He's from northeastern,
played pickup basketball

51:07.221 --> 51:08.923
with him a few times.

51:14.360 --> 51:15.528
He's coming by.

51:15.561 --> 51:17.506
Why the fuck would you have
him come over here, for what?

51:17.530 --> 51:19.199
I'm buying Molly off of him.

51:20.833 --> 51:21.902
Nice flip phone.

51:23.804 --> 51:24.905
That's my work phone.

51:30.543 --> 51:31.511
See you later.

51:31.545 --> 51:33.914
- All right.
- All right.

51:43.090 --> 51:44.225
Since when you do Molly?

51:44.257 --> 51:45.458
I don't.

51:45.492 --> 51:47.294
I figured I'd try it
tonight with you guys.

51:47.327 --> 51:48.462
And then what?

51:48.494 --> 51:49.295
We have a fucking
dance with each other

51:49.329 --> 51:50.898
in your lawnmower shop.

51:50.931 --> 51:52.900
We ain't seen each
other in a long time.

51:53.432 --> 51:55.369
I wanted tonight to be special.

51:57.403 --> 51:59.507
Come on, what's the big deal?

51:59.539 --> 52:01.275
Come on swaino,
don't be a pussy.

52:01.307 --> 52:02.876
I'm fine, fuck it,
why the fuck not?

52:02.909 --> 52:04.978
Why the fuck not?

52:05.012 --> 52:07.414
If we're gonna party,
I'm gonna fucking spark up.

52:07.447 --> 52:08.849
Anybody else?

52:08.882 --> 52:11.219
Is there still an old
lady in that closet?

52:23.329 --> 52:27.534
Hey, you know what, give me
fucking hit off the old lady.

52:27.568 --> 52:30.071
Hey, all right.

52:34.507 --> 52:36.276
I like this new,
out-of-control frank,

52:36.309 --> 52:39.279
it's been a long time since
you let your hair down.

52:40.079 --> 52:41.449
Let your hair down?

52:43.282 --> 52:44.885
Yeah, it means like relax.

52:48.121 --> 52:50.391
We know what it means,
but who without a vagina

52:50.423 --> 52:52.059
actually says that?

53:02.568 --> 53:04.103
I think you forgot.

53:05.606 --> 53:09.009
I think frank
forgot how to do it.

53:16.048 --> 53:19.452
Tell you what, that's
fucking precision crafting

53:19.485 --> 53:20.485
right there.

53:25.192 --> 53:26.192
Oh, fuck.

53:41.474 --> 53:44.077
My fucking secret to
youth, beyond all else,

53:44.110 --> 53:48.514
I only fucking fuck pussy
26 years old or younger.

53:48.547 --> 53:49.959
A woman doesn't
know how to make love

53:49.983 --> 53:51.518
until she's 30 years old.

53:51.550 --> 53:52.318
I can prefer a girl who
doesn't know how to fuck.

53:52.351 --> 53:53.653
I like that.

53:53.686 --> 53:55.088
So she won't be disappointed.

53:55.121 --> 53:56.389
That's fine, look,

53:56.422 --> 53:58.224
women have fucking
sexual issues, right?

53:58.257 --> 53:59.501
And what they do is they
bring that with them

53:59.525 --> 54:00.927
into the fucking bedroom.

54:00.960 --> 54:02.896
They have bad fucking
experiences, right?

54:02.929 --> 54:03.563
So I want to be there
in the beginning.

54:03.597 --> 54:05.365
You want to be there badly.

54:05.398 --> 54:07.500
What the fuck is that,
Jesus fucking Christ.

54:09.436 --> 54:12.373
Three months ago at my
cousin's bachelor party,

54:13.306 --> 54:16.342
this stripper, she put a
pinky finger right in my ass.

54:20.713 --> 54:22.482
Are you laughing
at me or with me?

54:24.150 --> 54:25.118
What?

54:25.152 --> 54:27.086
I thought we was all sharing.

54:28.521 --> 54:30.556
Just trust us, fucking trust us.

54:30.590 --> 54:32.293
It's fine, we'll clear the fire.

54:33.159 --> 54:35.561
- You know how to land.
- No, listen to me.

54:35.594 --> 54:36.963
Just bend your
knees, here we go.

54:36.996 --> 54:38.699
Let's give it a good one.

54:38.731 --> 54:41.467
One, two, come on, come on

54:41.501 --> 54:42.501
and three.

54:54.447 --> 54:55.615
So our Molly's here.

54:56.750 --> 54:57.750
Listen, listen.

55:01.454 --> 55:03.391
I don't want him to know
that I have a daughter.

55:05.092 --> 55:08.461
Afraid your drug dealer
won't think you're cool?

55:08.494 --> 55:10.463
Just do me this favor, okay?

55:10.496 --> 55:12.032
We let our hair down too?

55:13.400 --> 55:15.702
So we like laugh at
everything you say?

55:15.735 --> 55:17.538
I'll leave that up to you.

55:17.570 --> 55:18.570
What's up, man?

55:19.472 --> 55:21.608
Good to you see, man.

55:21.641 --> 55:23.476
Really appreciate you
coming on all this way.

55:23.510 --> 55:24.178
Yeah, no, it's cool.

55:24.210 --> 55:25.745
I really do, it means a lot.

55:25.778 --> 55:26.746
Hey, come on over here.

55:26.780 --> 55:28.282
Meet my boys.

55:29.016 --> 55:31.684
This is packie and
this is swaino.

55:31.717 --> 55:34.420
- Hey.
- Guys, this is Chad Walker.

55:34.454 --> 55:37.458
You should see this kid
play basketball, man.

55:37.490 --> 55:38.659
So should we deal with the-

55:41.460 --> 55:43.296
- diamonds?
- Yeah. Wow.

55:44.063 --> 55:46.500
Just like out in the
open like that, huh.

55:46.532 --> 55:47.634
What do you mean?

55:47.668 --> 55:49.445
It's frank's first big
drug deal, I think he thought

55:49.469 --> 55:52.740
there would be like code
words or some shit, you know?

55:52.773 --> 55:54.208
I'll get your money.

55:54.240 --> 55:55.509
Hold on to them.

55:56.443 --> 55:58.579
How much you want to
bet franky's got the money

55:58.612 --> 56:00.047
like in a Manila envelope.

56:00.079 --> 56:03.451
Like a rubber band
wrapped around it.

56:06.085 --> 56:07.520
You guys live here?

56:07.554 --> 56:08.689
We've got a bunk bed.

56:10.157 --> 56:11.658
How much you bench press, Chad?

56:11.690 --> 56:14.027
I don't use free
weights, it slows you down.

56:14.061 --> 56:15.570
I'm training with
plyometrics right now.

56:15.594 --> 56:17.297
How tall are you?

56:17.329 --> 56:18.731
Six, three, six, four.

56:18.764 --> 56:20.299
One or the other.

56:20.333 --> 56:22.302
- Somewhere in between.
- Got it.

56:22.802 --> 56:24.304
You got a nice eyes.

56:25.672 --> 56:26.706
Polo, huh?

56:27.273 --> 56:29.042
Yeah, like Ralph Lauren.

56:29.076 --> 56:31.211
Ralph Lauren, oh yeah, I got it.

56:31.244 --> 56:33.680
I like how the scarf
kind of hides that, huh?

56:33.713 --> 56:34.581
I mean, you don't wanna fuckin'

56:34.614 --> 56:36.784
just throw it out there
for people, right?

56:37.483 --> 56:39.786
What kind of car do you drive?

56:39.820 --> 56:40.788
G wagon.

56:40.820 --> 56:41.755
How much is it?

56:41.789 --> 56:43.824
I don't know, my dad
got it for me as a gift.

56:43.856 --> 56:45.358
Can I drive it?

56:45.391 --> 56:46.391
No.

56:49.228 --> 56:51.697
Oh, hey, you guys gonna
give me a hit of that thing?

56:51.731 --> 56:54.368
Oh, you don't have
to ask us twice.

56:54.400 --> 56:55.702
All right.

57:01.440 --> 57:04.344
So is that like your first
time you ever took pcp?

57:06.346 --> 57:09.349
Hey Chad, why don't
you come on inside,

57:09.382 --> 57:10.550
have a real man's drink.

57:12.552 --> 57:13.552
That'll show you.

57:15.889 --> 57:17.657
All right, Chad,
this is some good shit,

57:17.690 --> 57:19.426
you are in for a treat.

57:21.728 --> 57:23.563
Oh god, that is good.

57:27.833 --> 57:29.536
It tastes like shit.

57:31.338 --> 57:33.407
You, my friend, are what
a doctor would refer to

57:33.440 --> 57:34.708
as uncle Gary.

57:34.740 --> 57:35.740
That's for you.

57:37.409 --> 57:38.411
Manila envelope.

57:39.579 --> 57:43.250
So why is it so important
for old dudes to like scotch?

57:43.282 --> 57:45.418
In 10 years I'm gonna
ask you the same question,

57:45.452 --> 57:46.854
you know what you're gonna say?

57:46.887 --> 57:47.887
What?

57:50.289 --> 57:52.168
You know, I started out
thinking I could come up

57:52.192 --> 57:54.795
with something wicked funny,
but it just never liked gelled.

57:55.795 --> 57:58.865
Hey, frank this is only half.

57:58.898 --> 58:01.434
Oh shit, that's
right, I'm sorry.

58:01.467 --> 58:02.787
Let me get the
rest of your money.

58:08.440 --> 58:09.885
Hey, what kind
of filter you got on there?

58:09.909 --> 58:11.612
Nashville.

58:11.644 --> 58:13.347
I like perpetua.

58:13.380 --> 58:14.481
Let me ask you.

58:14.514 --> 58:15.148
Did you tag frank's shop?

58:15.181 --> 58:16.582
Yeah, I tagged him.

58:16.615 --> 58:17.851
We did too.

58:18.619 --> 58:21.355
When you guys were
my age it was like

58:23.789 --> 58:24.757
no Internet.

58:24.791 --> 58:26.326
No, it was fucking crazy.

58:26.358 --> 58:28.528
We did this thing, was
called going outside.

58:29.295 --> 58:33.199
How about you Mr. Fucking
big time drug dealer, huh?

58:33.233 --> 58:35.602
You you carry the cabbage?

58:35.635 --> 58:37.871
Yeah, yeah, I got you.

58:37.903 --> 58:39.539
What the fuck is that?

58:39.572 --> 58:40.706
It's a fucking Mason jar.

58:40.739 --> 58:42.642
Yeah, it's called
white champagne.

58:42.675 --> 58:45.913
Genius, let's see what
you're fucking packing, huh?

58:45.945 --> 58:47.923
You know what, speaking
of scotch, you guys remember

58:47.947 --> 58:49.815
the night at the game six.

58:49.849 --> 58:50.817
This fucking story again.

58:50.849 --> 58:51.849
The Buckner game?

58:52.818 --> 58:54.855
That's right, 1986.

58:55.755 --> 58:57.233
Sox gave new england
something they hadn't had

58:57.257 --> 58:59.793
in a long time, hope.

59:00.760 --> 59:03.931
What is this, a fucking
Ken burns documentary?

59:03.963 --> 59:05.199
I got it on YouTube.

59:08.867 --> 59:11.538
Sox lead the series going in.

59:11.570 --> 59:13.507
Me, frank and swaino,

59:13.539 --> 59:15.641
we're at Frankie's basement,
watching on this shitty

59:15.675 --> 59:18.245
little black and white
with aluminum foil

59:18.277 --> 59:19.645
on the antenna.

59:25.751 --> 59:26.887
Nearly home here.

59:26.920 --> 59:31.525
Let's see what clemens
comes back with.

59:31.557 --> 59:33.693
It was our own
little club house.

59:33.726 --> 59:35.528
Nobody ever caught
us down there.

59:40.032 --> 59:41.032
Ow.

59:43.836 --> 59:46.572
Fucking old men, they're
upstairs watching the same game

59:46.606 --> 59:48.875
on a fucking color TV.

59:48.907 --> 59:51.944
Our fathers spent their
lives watching the sox lose.

59:51.978 --> 59:54.782
They used to get wicked
fucking hammered down east.

59:55.516 --> 59:57.884
We knew we need to
leave them alone.

1:00:01.788 --> 1:00:03.889
It was unbelievable
because this is the night

1:00:03.922 --> 1:00:05.758
the curse of the fucking bambino

1:00:05.791 --> 1:00:07.893
was about to be fucking broken.

1:00:07.927 --> 1:00:09.630
Then something historic happens.

1:00:09.663 --> 1:00:11.597
Hey fuckheads,
histories happening,

1:00:11.630 --> 1:00:12.699
get your asses upstairs.

1:00:12.731 --> 1:00:13.833
Let's go.

1:00:13.867 --> 1:00:16.870
They never asked us up
there before, we're all like,

1:00:18.804 --> 1:00:21.340
come on, sit right here,
right next to your old man.

1:00:21.373 --> 1:00:25.278
And we're all sitting
there, fucking just like this.

1:00:25.311 --> 1:00:30.317
Right, we never felt love from
our fucking fathers before

1:00:30.949 --> 1:00:32.351
in our whole fucking
lives, right?

1:00:32.385 --> 1:00:33.754
Hey, keep your
eyes on this game,

1:00:33.786 --> 1:00:35.721
this is fricking
history here, okay?

1:00:35.755 --> 1:00:37.291
This was it.

1:00:38.025 --> 1:00:39.925
The sox were going to
win the world series

1:00:39.958 --> 1:00:42.962
and we were all gonna
be in the room together.

1:00:42.996 --> 1:00:44.731
Mookie Wilson gets a slow roller

1:00:44.764 --> 1:00:46.700
right up the first baseline.

1:00:46.733 --> 1:00:48.302
This is it.

1:00:48.335 --> 1:00:50.603
Bill Buckner squares
up, drops his glove

1:00:50.637 --> 1:00:54.975
and the fucking ball rolls
right between his goddamn legs.

1:00:55.742 --> 1:00:58.745
One of the worst errors
in baseball history.

1:00:58.777 --> 1:01:00.613
The mets score.

1:01:00.646 --> 1:01:01.815
- Fuck.
- Jesus.

1:01:02.916 --> 1:01:04.684
But it doesn't end there for us.

1:01:05.585 --> 1:01:09.356
We find ourselves in a
den of fucking lions.

1:01:10.255 --> 1:01:12.958
The problem is we had to
walk through the kitchen

1:01:12.992 --> 1:01:15.796
to get through the back
door and frank's old man

1:01:15.829 --> 1:01:17.931
was standing right there.

1:01:19.666 --> 1:01:20.906
Now, let me tell you something.

1:01:20.934 --> 1:01:22.936
We ain't never seen a
grown man cry before.

1:01:22.969 --> 1:01:24.604
It was terrifying.

1:01:24.637 --> 1:01:25.972
Frank's pop-

1:01:26.005 --> 1:01:26.972
- what the fuck
are you doing here?

1:01:27.005 --> 1:01:29.342
Grabs him, slams him
up against the fridge.

1:01:30.242 --> 1:01:32.778
This ain't like your
generation of millennials.

1:01:32.811 --> 1:01:35.548
This is when you
got fucking slapped.

1:01:35.581 --> 1:01:37.650
I told you to stay downstairs.

1:01:38.684 --> 1:01:39.985
What did I say?

1:01:40.018 --> 1:01:41.654
So what did swaino do?

1:01:41.688 --> 1:01:42.789
Stop!

1:01:42.822 --> 1:01:45.558
Grabs frank's pops arm,
tries to get him to stop.

1:01:45.592 --> 1:01:48.795
Now, this type of kid-on-adult
attack was unprecedented

1:01:48.827 --> 1:01:51.364
in our world and highly
ineffective since swaino

1:01:51.398 --> 1:01:53.367
was like all of a
bony 10-year-old.

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:56.570
Swaino's old man, he runs
in, throws swaino off.

1:01:56.603 --> 1:01:59.639
So I'm standing there
watching my two best friends

1:01:59.672 --> 1:02:03.043
get demolished by their
fathers and there's my old man.

1:02:03.076 --> 1:02:07.414
I looked at him, he looked
at me, then he shrugged,

1:02:07.447 --> 1:02:09.023
reaches out, guess he
figured he should get

1:02:09.047 --> 1:02:11.417
on the kid beating business too.

1:02:11.451 --> 1:02:12.985
So I did the only
thing I could do.

1:02:13.018 --> 1:02:16.021
Fled, like a
streak of midget lightning,

1:02:16.054 --> 1:02:18.391
he bolts like a bitch
out the front door.

1:02:18.425 --> 1:02:21.027
But not before I grabbed
a bottle of scotch.

1:02:21.059 --> 1:02:23.630
Except the screen
door was fucking locked.

1:02:23.663 --> 1:02:24.939
Well finally, packie
just burst through

1:02:24.963 --> 1:02:26.666
the motherfucker, right?

1:02:26.699 --> 1:02:28.577
He got the fucking screen
wrapped around his fucking head,

1:02:28.601 --> 1:02:29.945
and everybody's just
stops to look at him

1:02:29.969 --> 1:02:31.704
across the fucking lawn.

1:02:31.737 --> 1:02:34.173
And me and swaino, we use
that moment as a diversion

1:02:34.206 --> 1:02:35.842
to get the fuck
out of the house.

1:02:35.875 --> 1:02:36.543
And then we all met
in the fucking woods

1:02:36.576 --> 1:02:38.577
by that big rock where we'd go.

1:02:38.610 --> 1:02:39.722
Just a big fucking
rock in the woods.

1:02:39.746 --> 1:02:40.614
That's all it fucking
took back then.

1:02:40.646 --> 1:02:43.416
We passed around
that fucking bottle.

1:02:43.449 --> 1:02:45.852
It was the first time
any of us ever had scotch.

1:02:47.987 --> 1:02:49.923
And you want to
know something, Chad?

1:02:51.557 --> 1:02:53.527
It tasted like shit.

1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:03.202
You motherfucker you.

1:03:03.235 --> 1:03:05.038
So fucking beautiful.

1:03:05.070 --> 1:03:07.973
It was so fucking beautiful.

1:03:08.007 --> 1:03:09.007
Fucking genius.

1:03:11.878 --> 1:03:14.146
Hey guys look, I'm going
to take this real quick.

1:03:14.179 --> 1:03:16.081
Hey Chad, you can hang
out for a bit, right?

1:03:16.114 --> 1:03:17.183
No, I can hang for a few.

1:03:17.217 --> 1:03:20.653
Hey boys, entertain
our guest please.

1:03:23.088 --> 1:03:25.192
Hey Chad, what
does your father do?

1:03:25.224 --> 1:03:27.159
He's partners at
Landon and Wilkins.

1:03:27.193 --> 1:03:28.728
What the fuck is that?

1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:31.465
It's like the biggest
fucking law firm in Boston.

1:03:31.498 --> 1:03:33.066
So what's that
like, having a father

1:03:33.099 --> 1:03:34.634
you're not ashamed of?

1:03:34.666 --> 1:03:35.666
Good, I guess.

1:03:39.938 --> 1:03:41.641
Fucking call me Karen.

1:03:42.541 --> 1:03:43.541
Fuck.

1:03:45.811 --> 1:03:48.949
That's why you've been stuck
for three years in a row.

1:03:48.981 --> 1:03:50.526
You don't got to be like
a shot at point guard,

1:03:50.550 --> 1:03:52.085
you know what I mean?

1:03:52.117 --> 1:03:54.688
I'll tell you what I
want to know about, Chad.

1:03:54.721 --> 1:03:56.989
How about that
northeastern pussy?

1:03:57.023 --> 1:03:58.825
Being on the crew team
plus in the fraternity

1:03:58.858 --> 1:04:00.126
definitely has its benefits.

1:04:00.159 --> 1:04:02.128
You got nice eyes too,
don't discount that.

1:04:03.630 --> 1:04:04.798
That's what I thought.

1:04:04.831 --> 1:04:06.541
Well, you know, you don't
need any of that shit these days

1:04:06.565 --> 1:04:07.933
to get laid.

1:04:07.967 --> 1:04:10.170
Getting pussy man, it's
all through social media.

1:04:10.202 --> 1:04:12.038
I've been trying
to tell him that.

1:04:13.606 --> 1:04:15.149
How's that fucking
work, what do you do?

1:04:15.173 --> 1:04:17.110
You send fucking pictures
of your cock and shit?

1:04:17.143 --> 1:04:18.778
That's not a good idea.

1:04:19.913 --> 1:04:21.280
Whatever you put out there,

1:04:21.313 --> 1:04:22.047
that shit's gonna
haunt you, dude.

1:04:22.081 --> 1:04:23.617
How so?

1:04:23.650 --> 1:04:25.985
I saw like a couple of
days ago, my dad had to fire

1:04:26.018 --> 1:04:27.553
a junior attorney
because of a pic.

1:04:27.586 --> 1:04:30.556
I mean, the guy was at a
gay resort in los cabos,

1:04:30.590 --> 1:04:34.628
wearing a speedo, fucking tongue
kissing some Mexican dude.

1:04:34.661 --> 1:04:36.230
Wait, a lawyer can't be gay?

1:04:36.963 --> 1:04:39.164
What, you know my aunt
Connie is a lesbian.

1:04:39.197 --> 1:04:41.100
She rides a trike,
grows her own weed.

1:04:41.134 --> 1:04:43.168
Oh yeah, no dude, that's
that's nice and all.

1:04:43.202 --> 1:04:45.038
We can be all
politically correct.

1:04:45.070 --> 1:04:47.574
But the dudes running
this country, like my dad

1:04:47.606 --> 1:04:51.311
and his clients, man, their
mindset is back in 1955.

1:04:51.344 --> 1:04:53.213
My dad has a bunch of
billionaire clients

1:04:53.246 --> 1:04:55.648
who don't want to pay some
fucking faggot in a speedo

1:04:55.681 --> 1:04:57.817
$2200 an hour for legal advice.

1:04:57.849 --> 1:05:00.019
What kind of lawyer
makes $2200 an hour?

1:05:00.052 --> 1:05:01.186
The good ones.

1:05:02.121 --> 1:05:03.155
Hello?

1:05:04.824 --> 1:05:06.259
Finally, you dumb fuck.

1:05:06.291 --> 1:05:07.192
Fucking where the fuck are you,

1:05:07.226 --> 1:05:08.728
I'm about to call the police.

1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:09.295
Just calm down.

1:05:09.327 --> 1:05:10.429
Sorry, I've been busy.

1:05:10.463 --> 1:05:12.865
- Are you fucking serious?
- Calm down, where are you?

1:05:12.898 --> 1:05:13.833
I'm in the house.

1:05:13.867 --> 1:05:15.311
In my house, how the
fuck did you get in?

1:05:15.335 --> 1:05:16.836
I jimmied the fucking door,

1:05:16.869 --> 1:05:18.204
how'd you expect me to get in?

1:05:18.237 --> 1:05:19.606
Where the fuck is crystal?

1:05:19.639 --> 1:05:20.782
Crystal doesn't wanna
talk to you right now.

1:05:20.806 --> 1:05:21.942
All right?

1:05:21.974 --> 1:05:22.775
She's moving to
fuckin' California.

1:05:22.809 --> 1:05:23.877
What'd you say to her?

1:05:23.909 --> 1:05:25.244
Stop, please.

1:05:25.277 --> 1:05:26.178
I'm working really
hard here, frank.

1:05:26.211 --> 1:05:28.280
I'm trying to change.

1:05:28.313 --> 1:05:30.016
Don't fuck this up for me.

1:05:30.048 --> 1:05:30.849
Fucking tell me...

1:05:30.882 --> 1:05:31.918
Fuck.

1:05:33.219 --> 1:05:34.887
Gotta be fucking careful, bro.

1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:35.888
You can't put that stuff out.

1:05:35.922 --> 1:05:36.922
Here we go.

1:05:38.824 --> 1:05:40.359
Bob keats, motherfucker.

1:05:40.393 --> 1:05:42.095
What, you don't
fucking believe me?

1:05:42.128 --> 1:05:44.030
Boy, fucking
take him, gotta be careful.

1:05:44.063 --> 1:05:44.998
Oh no, no, no.

1:05:45.030 --> 1:05:46.900
I got a fucking story for you.

1:05:46.932 --> 1:05:49.335
So a few months ago I find
this chick on Instagram.

1:05:49.369 --> 1:05:51.637
She's really young
and really cute.

1:05:51.670 --> 1:05:53.706
And I dm and ask her to
come to a fraternity party.

1:05:53.739 --> 1:05:55.307
What the fuck is dm?

1:05:55.340 --> 1:05:56.175
Direct message.

1:05:56.208 --> 1:05:57.810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:05:57.844 --> 1:05:59.884
So she shows up, I get her
totally fucking hammered.

1:05:59.911 --> 1:06:01.914
I'm trying to shove
my dick in her mouth

1:06:01.947 --> 1:06:04.617
but she ends up being like
a total fucking cock tease.

1:06:04.650 --> 1:06:06.128
She gives me one of
those like half ass

1:06:06.152 --> 1:06:07.796
like falling asleep
hand jobs and I'm like,

1:06:07.820 --> 1:06:09.222
wake the fuck up, you know?

1:06:09.255 --> 1:06:12.992
Like it doesn't matter, a
waste of a goddamn night.

1:06:13.025 --> 1:06:14.669
I totally forget about it, it
doesn't fucking matter, right?

1:06:14.693 --> 1:06:18.697
But she's still into me
and she's sending me pics.

1:06:18.731 --> 1:06:19.799
Naked pictures?

1:06:19.831 --> 1:06:20.967
No, no, no.

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.835
We'll not at first,
tame at first, you know?

1:06:23.369 --> 1:06:24.037
So I coaxed her.

1:06:24.070 --> 1:06:25.672
I worked her and she sent them.

1:06:25.704 --> 1:06:27.773
But that's not the
weird thing, right?

1:06:28.807 --> 1:06:29.807
Here, hold on.

1:06:32.144 --> 1:06:35.949
She's got this condition,
her nipples are like-

1:06:36.748 --> 1:06:38.117
- holy fuck.

1:06:38.150 --> 1:06:40.286
Her nipples are
fucking gigantic.

1:06:40.318 --> 1:06:41.954
Look at that.

1:06:41.987 --> 1:06:43.155
I've seen bigger.

1:06:43.188 --> 1:06:45.692
I'm kind of worried this
chick has a medical condition,

1:06:45.724 --> 1:06:47.661
so I'm showing some of my buds.

1:06:47.693 --> 1:06:48.771
Sure, you gotta
get their opinion.

1:06:48.795 --> 1:06:49.829
Exactly, yeah, yeah.

1:06:49.862 --> 1:06:52.998
These big nip pics, I mean,
they're like, oh my god,

1:06:53.032 --> 1:06:54.734
they're striking a
chord with the boys

1:06:54.766 --> 1:06:57.670
and so I'm getting
her to send me more.

1:06:57.704 --> 1:06:59.682
Like send all kinds of
fucking pictures to me, man.

1:06:59.706 --> 1:07:01.708
And I'm sending them like
to everyone in the house

1:07:01.740 --> 1:07:02.950
and they're sending
them to everyone.

1:07:02.974 --> 1:07:04.677
So we call that going viral.

1:07:04.710 --> 1:07:06.354
Thank you for the
clarification, professor cuntface.

1:07:06.378 --> 1:07:07.346
So pancake shows
up to another one

1:07:07.380 --> 1:07:08.390
of our fraternity parties.

1:07:08.414 --> 1:07:09.949
Pancake, who's pancake?

1:07:09.981 --> 1:07:12.985
Pancake, that's
what I nicknamed her.

1:07:16.188 --> 1:07:17.332
'Cause of the size
of, you get it.

1:07:17.356 --> 1:07:19.159
That is so fucking fucked up.

1:07:19.192 --> 1:07:20.760
I know, I know.

1:07:20.793 --> 1:07:22.403
Yeah, so she shows up and
she's like famous now, right?

1:07:22.427 --> 1:07:23.962
Like she's a fucking star.

1:07:23.996 --> 1:07:26.032
We all know her, here she comes.

1:07:26.065 --> 1:07:27.133
Yeah, yeah.

1:07:27.166 --> 1:07:30.236
And these drunk dudes, they
start chanting, "pancake,

1:07:30.268 --> 1:07:32.337
pancake, pancake."

1:07:32.371 --> 1:07:33.306
Oh fuck.

1:07:33.338 --> 1:07:34.474
Everyone joins in, everyone.

1:07:34.507 --> 1:07:36.041
Like fuck, she joined in.

1:07:36.074 --> 1:07:37.218
She didn't know
what was going on.

1:07:37.242 --> 1:07:39.378
She's like, "pancake,
pancake, pancake."

1:07:43.181 --> 1:07:44.317
"Pancake, pancake."

1:07:44.349 --> 1:07:46.219
It was fucking terrible.

1:07:46.251 --> 1:07:50.824
But she finds out why and
she fucking storms out

1:07:50.856 --> 1:07:52.925
of the house, just
devastated man.

1:07:52.958 --> 1:07:55.227
Young girls, everything's
the end of the fucking world.

1:07:55.260 --> 1:07:57.764
Everything's the end of
the fucking world, yeah.

1:07:57.797 --> 1:08:01.867
She goes back to her home,
takes a bottle of pills,

1:08:02.902 --> 1:08:04.436
tries to fucking kill herself.

1:08:04.469 --> 1:08:05.838
Jesus.

1:08:05.871 --> 1:08:07.907
That fucking took
a turn for the dark.

1:08:09.242 --> 1:08:11.478
I mean, she okay or-

1:08:11.510 --> 1:08:15.380
- I don't know, my dad told
me not to get involved.

1:08:15.414 --> 1:08:17.283
I can't get caught
up in that shit.

1:08:17.315 --> 1:08:20.853
I mean, I feel bad, but
it's like my dad says,

1:08:20.886 --> 1:08:22.221
you can't...

1:08:23.021 --> 1:08:25.759
She shouldn't have sent
the pics to begin with.

1:08:27.527 --> 1:08:30.063
Hey guys, it's
fucking cold out there.

1:08:30.095 --> 1:08:31.029
Come on in.

1:08:31.063 --> 1:08:32.364
That's my whole fucking point.

1:08:32.398 --> 1:08:34.067
Gotta be fucking careful.

1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:35.368
Internet's forever, bro.

1:08:46.244 --> 1:08:47.780
I got to split.

1:08:47.814 --> 1:08:49.124
Oh no, come on,
do one shot with me.

1:08:49.148 --> 1:08:50.382
Listen, I'm late, I'm late.

1:08:50.416 --> 1:08:51.951
One shot, you'll
be on your merry way.

1:08:51.984 --> 1:08:53.053
A little baby shot.

1:08:54.287 --> 1:08:55.421
All right.

1:08:55.453 --> 1:08:58.057
One shot, one for the road.

1:08:59.091 --> 1:09:00.360
Actually I'm done partying.

1:09:04.896 --> 1:09:06.298
Frank almost had a heart attack.

1:09:08.266 --> 1:09:09.266
For you.

1:09:12.270 --> 1:09:13.270
Oh, a big one.

1:09:16.576 --> 1:09:19.246
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

1:09:35.127 --> 1:09:40.133
Hey,

1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:43.436
what were you talking
about out there?

1:09:47.506 --> 1:09:49.276
Maybe joking about something.

1:09:50.009 --> 1:09:50.877
What is like funny?

1:09:50.909 --> 1:09:52.179
You was laughing.

1:10:00.386 --> 1:10:02.389
Hey, give me my keys back.

1:10:03.288 --> 1:10:06.158
You're not getting
these until you tell me

1:10:06.192 --> 1:10:08.927
what you guys were laughing at.

1:10:08.961 --> 1:10:11.297
Maybe just show him the
pancake pic, I don't know.

1:10:11.329 --> 1:10:12.364
A picture?

1:10:13.332 --> 1:10:15.235
It was a stupid story, frank.

1:10:16.002 --> 1:10:18.137
Frank, give the fucking
kid his keys back.

1:10:18.170 --> 1:10:20.172
I want to see his picture.

1:10:20.206 --> 1:10:21.282
Frank, it's a stupid
fucking story.

1:10:21.306 --> 1:10:22.507
I know, just-

1:10:22.541 --> 1:10:26.011
- hey frank, take it easy, man.

1:10:28.514 --> 1:10:29.983
You take it fucking easy.

1:10:33.319 --> 1:10:34.439
Show me the fucking picture.

1:10:38.356 --> 1:10:39.626
What do I do here?

1:10:39.658 --> 1:10:42.895
Hey frank, what are
you fucking doing?

1:10:46.164 --> 1:10:50.336
Show me the fucking
picture right now.

1:10:57.542 --> 1:11:00.545
Swaino and Karen had coffee.

1:11:00.578 --> 1:11:03.248
Oh, for Christ's
sake, fucking idiot.

1:11:03.282 --> 1:11:04.282
My Karen?

1:11:05.984 --> 1:11:07.353
- Yeah.
- And-

1:11:07.386 --> 1:11:10.590
- what do you mean and,
yeah, we fucking had coffee.

1:11:12.224 --> 1:11:13.293
Did you fuck her?

1:11:14.726 --> 1:11:16.194
How could you
fucking ask me that?

1:11:16.228 --> 1:11:17.339
No, fuck you for asking me that.

1:11:17.363 --> 1:11:18.431
Fuck you, frank.

1:11:18.463 --> 1:11:19.131
Okay then, why did you meet?

1:11:19.164 --> 1:11:21.434
She took a redeye, all right?

1:11:21.466 --> 1:11:24.569
She couldn't fucking find you
in your shop or in your house.

1:11:24.603 --> 1:11:25.471
So she came to my
work, she freaked out

1:11:25.503 --> 1:11:27.539
because she's fucking Karen.

1:11:27.573 --> 1:11:29.108
What did you tell her?

1:11:29.140 --> 1:11:30.585
I told her that I
could fucking care less

1:11:30.609 --> 1:11:32.445
if she's fucking sober now.

1:11:32.478 --> 1:11:34.146
And that she said
that all she wanted

1:11:34.180 --> 1:11:35.448
was to see her daughter.

1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:36.581
It's her fucking daughter.

1:11:36.614 --> 1:11:37.550
Oh, by the way,
frank's got a daughter.

1:11:37.582 --> 1:11:39.251
You still think he's cool.

1:11:39.284 --> 1:11:41.453
Fuck, I'm looking out
for you and crystal.

1:11:41.487 --> 1:11:44.324
That's all I'm doing, that's
all I'm ever fucking doing.

1:11:45.056 --> 1:11:46.492
Crystal?

1:11:52.264 --> 1:11:53.266
Whoa, whoa.

1:11:57.002 --> 1:12:01.573
Jeez, you just killed Chad
Walker with a wrench, frank.

1:12:02.274 --> 1:12:04.144
What the fuck did
you do that for?

1:12:12.318 --> 1:12:13.318
He's not dead.

1:12:16.421 --> 1:12:17.531
Hey Frankie, I'm
gonna ask you again.

1:12:17.555 --> 1:12:19.525
What the fuck are you doing?

1:12:21.226 --> 1:12:23.296
That story that he
was telling you about?

1:12:25.631 --> 1:12:26.631
It's crystal.

1:12:49.387 --> 1:12:50.765
That fucking picture
that he showed us,

1:12:50.789 --> 1:12:52.024
that was crystal?

1:13:07.305 --> 1:13:08.307
She'll be okay, frank.

1:13:13.412 --> 1:13:14.412
It's been two weeks.

1:13:20.552 --> 1:13:22.055
And she hasn't woken up yet.

1:13:24.355 --> 1:13:26.725
We don't know the extent
of the brain damage.

1:13:29.528 --> 1:13:31.697
It's different every day.

1:13:39.438 --> 1:13:40.707
When she came to me,

1:13:43.208 --> 1:13:44.810
when she needed me the most...

1:13:49.782 --> 1:13:51.117
What the fuck were you thinking?

1:13:51.149 --> 1:13:52.684
He said they were just for him.

1:13:52.717 --> 1:13:55.520
You're supposed to be
smarter than that, crystal.

1:13:59.658 --> 1:14:00.760
Dad, please.

1:14:02.427 --> 1:14:03.729
You are gonna turn out

1:14:03.761 --> 1:14:05.264
to be just like
your fucking mother.

1:14:08.533 --> 1:14:09.568
Fuck.

1:14:09.601 --> 1:14:10.601
I didn't know.

1:14:12.770 --> 1:14:17.277
I don't fuckin' understand
this, picture's were online.

1:14:18.743 --> 1:14:21.746
Everybody in her high school
passing them around.

1:14:21.779 --> 1:14:23.282
Everybody making fun of her.

1:14:24.516 --> 1:14:27.353
Even her best
friends, relentless.

1:14:31.524 --> 1:14:32.692
So she had enough.

1:14:34.693 --> 1:14:36.362
Hey hun, I'm coming in.

1:14:39.564 --> 1:14:40.564
Crystal,

1:14:45.570 --> 1:14:46.570
Crystal, crystal!

1:14:51.476 --> 1:14:52.744
What did you do?

1:15:02.787 --> 1:15:04.456
His fucking father.

1:15:08.426 --> 1:15:09.706
His fucking father is connected.

1:15:12.898 --> 1:15:14.434
He made it all go away.

1:15:16.801 --> 1:15:19.804
And crystal is just the
poor girl from manch-Vegas.

1:15:19.837 --> 1:15:21.306
Nobody fucking cares.

1:15:24.475 --> 1:15:25.475
Nobody but us.

1:15:30.949 --> 1:15:33.485
So what are we gonna do?

1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:36.788
I'm gonna kill him.

1:15:43.662 --> 1:15:45.398
I'll pull the trigger.

1:15:45.430 --> 1:15:46.731
That's on me.

1:15:46.765 --> 1:15:48.535
But I needed you
two here with me.

1:15:54.739 --> 1:15:56.542
There's a lot of work
with the disposal.

1:15:59.511 --> 1:16:00.647
The disposal?

1:16:01.646 --> 1:16:03.783
Yeah, I planned it all out.

1:16:04.984 --> 1:16:06.953
I prepped the room.

1:17:50.756 --> 1:17:52.458
That's your fucking plan?

1:17:52.990 --> 1:17:54.359
Yes.

1:17:54.393 --> 1:17:55.594
What about the g-wagon?

1:17:55.627 --> 1:17:58.030
We drive it to Hyde
park, smash the window,

1:17:58.063 --> 1:18:00.032
put some of his blood
on the front seat.

1:18:00.064 --> 1:18:01.265
Come on.

1:18:01.300 --> 1:18:03.077
It's not the first
time that a drug deal went bad

1:18:03.101 --> 1:18:04.636
and not fucking found.

1:18:04.670 --> 1:18:06.838
The kid's fucking
he, he's 19 years old.

1:18:06.872 --> 1:18:08.606
People ain't gonna
fuckin' give up on a kid.

1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.343
He's a fucking drug dealer.

1:18:10.376 --> 1:18:11.952
Come on, he's a very
casual fucking drug dealer.

1:18:11.976 --> 1:18:13.712
The kid ain't fucking
scarface here.

1:18:13.746 --> 1:18:16.349
I mean just you called
him on your phone, right?

1:18:16.381 --> 1:18:18.951
- It was a burner.
- What the fuck is a burner?

1:18:18.984 --> 1:18:21.987
You don't watch "the wire?"

1:18:22.020 --> 1:18:24.057
You took the fucking
Molly, didn't you?

1:18:26.658 --> 1:18:30.463
Frank, Frankie, I think
that we need to think here.

1:18:30.496 --> 1:18:32.864
I think that we're just,
we're going too fucking fast.

1:18:32.898 --> 1:18:37.470
He ruined crystal's
life over a fucking joke.

1:18:37.502 --> 1:18:40.505
Okay, our crystal.

1:18:40.538 --> 1:18:43.141
That's all that we should
be thinking about right now.

1:18:43.175 --> 1:18:44.711
When you're right, you're right.

1:18:46.845 --> 1:18:48.681
I'm in, frank.

1:18:48.713 --> 1:18:49.713
I'm in.

1:18:55.921 --> 1:18:57.590
Yeah, all right, I'm in.

1:19:08.199 --> 1:19:09.902
Fuck, this is
fucking crazy, frank.

1:19:09.935 --> 1:19:13.905
This is fucking crazy, could
you guys just fucking stop

1:19:13.939 --> 1:19:14.939
for one fucking second?

1:19:20.878 --> 1:19:22.723
Frankie, how are we gonna
fuckin' get out of this?

1:19:22.747 --> 1:19:25.049
You didn't fucking
think about it.

1:19:25.082 --> 1:19:26.885
Wait, where are you, pack?

1:19:30.655 --> 1:19:31.655
Fuck!

1:19:41.065 --> 1:19:43.735
You're fucking out of your mind.

1:19:43.769 --> 1:19:47.106
Swaino, if you want to
go, now's the time to go.

1:19:47.573 --> 1:19:49.875
You know, like you said,
it's fucking easy, Frankie.

1:19:49.908 --> 1:19:51.644
I never fucking
said it was easy.

1:19:52.110 --> 1:19:55.113
What am I supposed to do,
I'm an accomplice, I'm here.

1:19:56.180 --> 1:19:57.949
What am I supposed to do?

1:19:57.983 --> 1:19:59.585
Guys, Chad Walker is awake.

1:20:06.123 --> 1:20:07.225
You wannna say something?

1:20:11.963 --> 1:20:14.233
Please, please don't do this.

1:20:14.265 --> 1:20:17.670
Your ass is definitely not
talking out of this shit, Chad.

1:20:17.703 --> 1:20:19.839
Swaino, help me please.

1:20:19.872 --> 1:20:22.740
No, I'm not a part of this,
okay, I'm not a part of it.

1:20:22.774 --> 1:20:25.744
Wait, just let me
say something please.

1:20:25.777 --> 1:20:26.777
What?

1:20:27.779 --> 1:20:33.719
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I made
a mistake, I'm just a kid.

1:20:34.118 --> 1:20:36.889
My parents, and the Internet,
the fucking Internet.

1:20:36.921 --> 1:20:38.089
I know I hurt her.

1:20:38.122 --> 1:20:39.122
I didn't mean it.

1:20:40.292 --> 1:20:43.796
I've been working in
the shop almost every day

1:20:43.828 --> 1:20:45.997
for over 10 fucking years,

1:20:46.030 --> 1:20:48.167
trying to give my
daughter a future.

1:20:48.734 --> 1:20:54.106
But then you came along
and you treat her like a,

1:20:55.740 --> 1:20:57.943
you treated her like
a piece of garbage.

1:20:57.975 --> 1:21:00.679
I didn't know she
was in high school.

1:21:00.712 --> 1:21:01.923
Was it funny passing
around that picture

1:21:01.947 --> 1:21:03.949
of my little baby girl, huh?

1:21:05.149 --> 1:21:07.853
Bet you all got a big
fucking laugh, right?

1:21:07.886 --> 1:21:09.789
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:21:10.322 --> 1:21:11.556
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1:21:11.590 --> 1:21:14.659
I'm sorry.

1:21:15.293 --> 1:21:16.293
No, no.

1:21:18.262 --> 1:21:23.269
No, no, no, please no.

1:21:26.270 --> 1:21:28.139
No, please, please, no.

1:21:32.010 --> 1:21:33.880
No, please, please.

1:21:35.814 --> 1:21:36.849
No, no.

1:21:38.350 --> 1:21:40.753
No, please, no, come on.

1:21:42.220 --> 1:21:44.757
Let me say goodbye
to my mom and dad.

1:21:44.789 --> 1:21:46.824
Please, let me say
goodbye to them.

1:21:46.858 --> 1:21:49.028
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:21:53.798 --> 1:21:54.798
No, no!

1:21:59.904 --> 1:22:01.573
Wait, Instagram!

1:22:01.606 --> 1:22:02.926
Instagram, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1:22:04.710 --> 1:22:06.211
What the fuck?

1:22:06.243 --> 1:22:09.948
He posted on Instagram,
we all did, Frankie.

1:22:09.981 --> 1:22:12.051
He posted on the Internet.

1:22:12.083 --> 1:22:13.193
Going out in the fucking world.

1:22:13.217 --> 1:22:14.920
We all did.

1:22:14.953 --> 1:22:16.655
Oh, this is unbelievable.

1:22:16.688 --> 1:22:18.757
All the cops gotta do, just look

1:22:18.789 --> 1:22:19.968
at his fucking Instagram
and knows that he's here.

1:22:19.992 --> 1:22:21.025
Swaino's right.

1:22:21.059 --> 1:22:21.659
And we are all fucked.

1:22:21.693 --> 1:22:24.296
I have 2,854 followers.

1:22:24.328 --> 1:22:25.930
Hey, you shut the fuck up.

1:22:25.963 --> 1:22:27.332
You're so fucked.

1:22:27.365 --> 1:22:29.234
Oh my god, I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

1:22:29.266 --> 1:22:30.769
- You're gonna untie me-
- shut up.

1:22:30.801 --> 1:22:32.136
And we're gonna call the cops.

1:22:32.170 --> 1:22:33.204
Shut up!

1:22:33.238 --> 1:22:34.238
Attempted murder.

1:22:34.939 --> 1:22:36.140
Shut up!

1:22:36.173 --> 1:22:38.210
Oh my father's gonna
sue the shit out of you.

1:22:38.243 --> 1:22:42.081
You guys are gonna get your
fucking ass raped in jail.

1:22:42.113 --> 1:22:44.082
Get ready, boys.

1:22:44.115 --> 1:22:45.818
Start stretching those
fucking assholes.

1:22:45.850 --> 1:22:47.018
Shut the fuck up!

1:22:47.051 --> 1:22:50.088
You should've taught your
whore fucking daughter not to-

1:22:52.056 --> 1:22:53.358
- Frankie, no, Frankie, no.

1:22:56.694 --> 1:22:58.063
No, don't no.

1:22:58.095 --> 1:22:59.095
No, Frankie.

1:23:03.402 --> 1:23:04.402
Fuck.

1:23:06.337 --> 1:23:08.273
Frankie, listen to me carefully.

1:23:08.305 --> 1:23:10.108
Hey, fucking help.

1:23:14.945 --> 1:23:16.914
Yeah, I'll go, I'll go.

1:23:35.466 --> 1:23:37.402
I can see
you over there, swaino,

1:23:37.435 --> 1:23:39.103
you fuckin' chimpanzee,

1:23:39.136 --> 1:23:40.773
open the fucking door.

1:23:40.805 --> 1:23:43.174
Karen, you better get
the fuck outta here.

1:23:43.207 --> 1:23:45.277
What the fuck
is going on, frank?

1:23:45.310 --> 1:23:48.380
I swear I'll throw my fist
through the fucking window.

1:23:48.412 --> 1:23:51.349
- Karen just go-
- all right, I'm kicking.

1:23:51.382 --> 1:23:54.086
All right, all right, get in.

1:23:54.118 --> 1:23:56.054
What the fuck is going on?

1:23:56.087 --> 1:23:57.432
Jeez, why the blood all
of you, what is this,

1:23:57.456 --> 1:23:58.990
a fight club or something,

1:23:59.024 --> 1:24:00.168
you guys finally
fucking each other?

1:24:00.192 --> 1:24:01.369
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1:24:01.393 --> 1:24:03.438
I went on Instagram, I saw
this jackass checked in here.

1:24:03.462 --> 1:24:06.131
If you think you can keep
my daughter away from me,

1:24:06.163 --> 1:24:09.033
I swear to god I'll get a lawyer,
I'll get a fucking lawyer.

1:24:09.067 --> 1:24:10.202
Calm the fuck down.

1:24:10.234 --> 1:24:12.871
Okay, you told him that we
talked this morning, right?

1:24:12.904 --> 1:24:14.740
And you asked if
we fucked, right?

1:24:14.773 --> 1:24:16.307
Do you think I would do that?

1:24:16.341 --> 1:24:18.018
Do you think I'm that
kind of a fucking person.

1:24:18.042 --> 1:24:19.320
Would you please just
stop fucking talking?

1:24:19.344 --> 1:24:21.913
Shut the fuck up, swaino.

1:24:21.947 --> 1:24:23.215
Okay.

1:24:23.247 --> 1:24:25.216
- Karen.
- Where the fuck is my kid?

1:24:26.952 --> 1:24:29.188
Where the fuck is
my fucking kid?

1:24:31.355 --> 1:24:33.992
Something happened to crystal.

1:24:34.024 --> 1:24:35.024
What?

1:24:36.962 --> 1:24:38.297
What, what the fuck happened?

1:24:38.329 --> 1:24:39.430
I need you to calm-

1:24:39.463 --> 1:24:40.332
- tell me what fucking
happened, frank.

1:24:40.364 --> 1:24:42.333
Sit the fuck down, please.

1:25:11.128 --> 1:25:12.363
I need you to get in your car

1:25:12.396 --> 1:25:14.198
and get the fuck out of here.

1:25:14.231 --> 1:25:15.231
Just go away,

1:25:17.402 --> 1:25:18.402
right now.

1:25:21.372 --> 1:25:22.507
Where the fuck is he?

1:27:21.192 --> 1:27:24.162
So what are we gonna do?

1:27:24.194 --> 1:27:28.900
I'm gonna cop a plea
and turn myself in.

1:27:28.934 --> 1:27:31.170
Tell them you guys have
nothing to do with this.

1:27:32.537 --> 1:27:33.537
What?

1:27:42.447 --> 1:27:46.652
Hey listen, give me
a half hour head start

1:27:46.685 --> 1:27:48.187
before you let him go.

1:27:49.554 --> 1:27:50.554
Okay?

1:27:52.524 --> 1:27:56.328
I got to say goodbye to her,
before I turn myself in.

1:27:59.965 --> 1:28:01.233
You can count on us, Frankie.

1:28:01.265 --> 1:28:02.300
I'm sorry.

1:28:03.068 --> 1:28:04.103
All right.

1:28:17.247 --> 1:28:19.250
You got to take care
of her now, Karen.

1:28:19.283 --> 1:28:20.152
Wait what?

1:28:20.185 --> 1:28:21.486
Hang on frank.

1:28:21.519 --> 1:28:23.221
She's her mother.

1:28:23.253 --> 1:28:24.256
She's her mother.

1:28:24.288 --> 1:28:25.122
It doesn't matter.

1:28:25.155 --> 1:28:25.690
What's she gonna do?

1:28:25.724 --> 1:28:27.559
She's gonna run off.

1:28:27.591 --> 1:28:29.226
You gotta trust me.

1:28:29.260 --> 1:28:30.427
You got to fucking trust me.

1:28:30.461 --> 1:28:33.298
Fuck her and the
fucking horse she walked in on.

1:28:33.331 --> 1:28:34.407
It's not about
growing the fuck up.

1:28:34.431 --> 1:28:35.967
I've been there for Christ sake.

1:28:36.001 --> 1:28:38.302
All right, just
stop it, just stop it,

1:28:38.336 --> 1:28:39.637
god damn it, enough.

1:28:41.439 --> 1:28:42.740
You're just gonna give up?

1:28:42.774 --> 1:28:44.142
The fuck we
supposed to do, Karen?

1:28:44.175 --> 1:28:47.346
I don't know, I don't know.

1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:50.748
But on top of everything else
that piece of shit did to her

1:28:50.782 --> 1:28:53.152
he's gonna take her
father away from her too.

1:28:56.587 --> 1:28:58.289
Crystal needs her father.

1:28:59.256 --> 1:29:00.256
She needs you.

1:29:03.161 --> 1:29:08.132
Karen, if they stay,
you're all going to jail.

1:29:10.234 --> 1:29:11.379
You're saying we can't outsmart

1:29:11.403 --> 1:29:13.137
some soft fucking pretty boy?

1:29:15.774 --> 1:29:17.376
You don't understand
who his father is.

1:29:17.408 --> 1:29:19.643
Fuck his fucking father.

1:29:19.676 --> 1:29:22.213
Fuck his entire fucking family.

1:29:22.247 --> 1:29:24.615
He ain't gonna win
this time, not today.

1:29:27.484 --> 1:29:29.153
Guys, we've gotta be smart.

1:29:29.953 --> 1:29:31.689
We're gonna use
our fucking heads.

1:29:35.359 --> 1:29:36.359
We just gotta think.

1:29:40.064 --> 1:29:41.344
Now we just got
to work together.

1:29:46.337 --> 1:29:47.706
Packie, you're smart.

1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:51.342
You're the smartest guy I know.

1:29:53.511 --> 1:29:55.514
He ruined her
life with a picture.

1:29:59.716 --> 1:30:00.716
So what?

1:30:05.823 --> 1:30:06.823
Hey guys,

1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:11.195
I think I got an idea.

1:30:12.296 --> 1:30:13.296
Packie,

1:30:17.601 --> 1:30:18.845
you want to keep
Frankie out of jail?

1:30:18.869 --> 1:30:20.372
Yeah.

1:30:56.140 --> 1:30:57.576
I don't know about this.

1:30:57.609 --> 1:30:59.511
Hey, hey, pack, you
can fucking do this.

1:30:59.543 --> 1:31:01.378
Why me?

1:31:01.412 --> 1:31:03.615
Because yours is
by far the most photogenic.

1:31:03.648 --> 1:31:05.550
- Packie.
- You got it

1:31:05.582 --> 1:31:07.384
you can do it, packie.

1:31:07.417 --> 1:31:07.853
You can do it.

1:31:07.886 --> 1:31:09.387
That a boy.

1:31:09.420 --> 1:31:10.780
- You got it.
- That a boy, packie.

1:31:11.756 --> 1:31:13.725
I don't know guys, it
seems a little homophobic.

1:31:13.757 --> 1:31:15.460
It's a lot fucking homophobic

1:31:15.493 --> 1:31:17.204
but that's kind of the
fucking point, all right?

1:31:17.228 --> 1:31:18.396
Am I right?

1:31:19.296 --> 1:31:20.531
You got it, pack.

1:31:25.569 --> 1:31:27.206
Karen, can you
turn around please?

1:31:31.475 --> 1:31:33.679
Okay pack, take it off.

1:31:34.612 --> 1:31:37.282
Not your shirt, the pillowcase.

1:31:39.283 --> 1:31:41.318
That's it.

1:31:41.351 --> 1:31:42.653
What the fuck is this?

1:31:43.787 --> 1:31:46.590
- Holy shit, packie.
- Open your mouth.

1:31:46.623 --> 1:31:48.659
No way, no fucking way.

1:31:48.693 --> 1:31:50.195
Open your mouth.

1:31:50.228 --> 1:31:51.429
No fucking way.

1:31:51.462 --> 1:31:52.462
Open your fucking mouth.

1:32:01.838 --> 1:32:02.838
Ata boy.

1:32:03.975 --> 1:32:05.677
What's the passcode?

1:32:05.710 --> 1:32:07.645
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

1:32:07.679 --> 1:32:08.821
I think I'm on the wrong screen.

1:32:08.845 --> 1:32:09.913
Get the fucking picture.

1:32:09.947 --> 1:32:13.918
Okay, okay, okay, I got
it, I got it, I got it.

1:32:13.952 --> 1:32:15.353
Right there.

1:32:20.792 --> 1:32:21.792
Show him.

1:32:25.863 --> 1:32:27.699
Can you tell it's me?

1:32:27.731 --> 1:32:28.908
Only if someone's
seen your cock, pack,

1:32:28.932 --> 1:32:30.202
I think you're safe.

1:32:32.804 --> 1:32:35.440
Yeah, and what the fuck are
you going to do with that?

1:32:44.748 --> 1:32:49.688
Okay Chad, now the way we
see it, there's two options

1:32:49.720 --> 1:32:51.722
in how we move forward.

1:32:51.756 --> 1:32:55.927
Option one, you go, you run
like the little bitch you are,

1:32:55.960 --> 1:32:57.996
you run to your father,
run to the cops.

1:32:58.029 --> 1:32:58.930
You're all fucked.

1:32:58.962 --> 1:33:00.532
Excuse me, young man.

1:33:00.564 --> 1:33:03.402
Excuse me, you interrupted me.

1:33:08.273 --> 1:33:10.507
Now you can go to the
cops, but I'm gonna tell you

1:33:10.541 --> 1:33:15.413
right now, my friend right
there, he's a social networking

1:33:15.445 --> 1:33:16.747
fucking genius.

1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:17.890
And he will post this
picture it'll go everywhere.

1:33:17.914 --> 1:33:18.783
I mean everywhere.

1:33:18.815 --> 1:33:19.818
It'll do that thing.

1:33:19.850 --> 1:33:20.861
What's that thing called, pack?

1:33:20.885 --> 1:33:21.820
Going viral.

1:33:21.853 --> 1:33:22.854
It'll go fucking viral.

1:33:24.021 --> 1:33:26.423
It'll go fucking viral.

1:33:26.457 --> 1:33:27.926
No, I'll tell the truth.

1:33:28.693 --> 1:33:30.729
And when that comes
out, they'll believe me.

1:33:30.761 --> 1:33:32.740
It won't make a fucking
difference, Chad, and you know it.

1:33:32.764 --> 1:33:34.707
The truth will make them
share it even more probably.

1:33:34.731 --> 1:33:36.301
Probably.

1:33:36.333 --> 1:33:38.737
So Chad, no one's gonna
pay you that $2,200 an hour.

1:33:38.770 --> 1:33:41.773
Shit, you'll be unhirable, Chad.

1:33:41.805 --> 1:33:45.009
Your father, those bullshit
billionaire clients of his

1:33:45.042 --> 1:33:46.877
they're gonna laugh at you.

1:33:46.911 --> 1:33:48.613
Every single time you
walk out of a room

1:33:48.645 --> 1:33:50.047
they're gonna laugh.

1:33:50.081 --> 1:33:52.583
Maybe your friends will
come up with a nickname

1:33:52.617 --> 1:33:53.284
for you this time.

1:33:53.318 --> 1:33:56.454
Yeah, like captain dicksucker.

1:33:59.489 --> 1:34:00.867
Yeah, hopefully a little
more creative than that

1:34:00.891 --> 1:34:02.726
but yes, something
along those lines.

1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:03.760
Option two.

1:34:04.095 --> 1:34:05.896
You want to hear option two?

1:34:07.864 --> 1:34:12.002
You walk out of here and you
never ever mention this night

1:34:12.036 --> 1:34:14.405
to anyone anywhere, and it'll
be like this whole night

1:34:14.439 --> 1:34:16.742
including this very
provocative photo

1:34:17.742 --> 1:34:18.909
never fucking happened.

1:34:25.983 --> 1:34:27.485
What's it gonna be, Chad?

1:34:33.623 --> 1:34:34.626
Option two.

1:34:38.662 --> 1:34:39.662
Goddamn right.

1:34:45.970 --> 1:34:46.970
Cut him free.

1:35:10.627 --> 1:35:12.596
Get the fuck out of my shop.

1:36:48.826 --> 1:36:49.826
Your family's here.
