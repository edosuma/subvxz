Previously on The O.C.
It's about your father.

00:02.640 --> 00:03.600
He's dead.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.480
She's taking it
pretty hard, huh?

00:08.560 --> 00:09.800
Get your hands off me!

00:09.840 --> 00:11.080
Are you happy?

00:11.120 --> 00:12.360
Your family requested
that I be here today

00:12.400 --> 00:13.840
to help them lead
an intervention.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.360
They are worried that you
have an addiction to alcohol.

00:16.440 --> 00:17.440
KIRSTEN:
I'm so sorry

00:17.480 --> 00:18.960
that I put you
through this.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.480
SUMMER:
He attacked her, Seth,

00:20.560 --> 00:21.480
but she didn't
tell Ryan because...

00:21.560 --> 00:22.440
Well, he has to know.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.560
I'm gonna settle this

00:23.640 --> 00:25.440
with Trey
once and for all.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.560
( yelling )

00:30.640 --> 00:32.040
Oh, my God, stop it.
You're killing him.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.840

00:47.360 --> 00:49.160
I got a gunshot wound,
exited right clavicle,

00:49.200 --> 00:50.720
punctured an artery.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.080
He's still alive?
Not for long.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.080
RYAN:
How could you?

00:54.120 --> 00:56.440
I would have done
anything for you.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.600
TREY:
Man, I was messed up.
I was stoned.

00:58.680 --> 00:59.880
We still have
some more questions for you.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.200
I'm gonna see if he's
gonna be okay.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.640
MARISSA:
Trey, get off of him!

01:02.680 --> 01:03.760
He's not gonna die, right?

01:03.800 --> 01:04.959
RYAN:
It wasn't my idea, Trey.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.520
I didn't want
to steal that car.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.040
TREY:
Yeah, well. Hey, man,
I went away for it

01:08.120 --> 01:09.040
and, you got the good life.

01:09.080 --> 01:09.920
RYAN:
You had to destroy it.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.240
You had to hurt her, huh?

01:11.280 --> 01:13.040
Hey, it's my brother.
Is he gonna be okay?

01:13.080 --> 01:14.680
He'd be better if someone
hadn't shot him.
Wait,
wait, please.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.760
He's lost a lot of blood.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.200
Jesus, what the hell
happened to you?

01:20.240 --> 01:22.320
I was in a fight.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.840
Could someone look
at this kid?!

01:23.880 --> 01:26.880
You can look at him just as soon
as we're done talking to him.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.200
Ryan!

01:30.440 --> 01:31.360
You discharged
this weapon, ma'am.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.520
Yes, I already...

01:32.600 --> 01:33.960
Don't answer!
Don't say anything!

01:35.080 --> 01:36.240
( fuzzy ):
You okay?

01:46.960 --> 01:48.440
( echoing ):
You all right?

01:50.320 --> 01:51.600
( echoing ):
Ryan?

01:53.760 --> 01:54.800
Seth?

01:54.880 --> 01:55.880
You okay?

01:55.960 --> 01:57.040
You okay?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.720
( knocking )

02:07.800 --> 02:11.320
Hey, man. Just wanted
you to know that, uh...

02:11.360 --> 02:13.120
You okay?

02:13.200 --> 02:16.040
I just had the worst nightmare.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.640
Yeah? I got some bad news.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.680
It wasn't a dream.
Yeah, yeah. I know.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.440
Well, that lawyer guy's
on his way over, so.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.720
Yeah.

03:18.456 --> 03:20.896
You know Coop,
if you'd have asked me

03:20.976 --> 03:23.016
what we'd be doing the
weekend before senior year,

03:23.016 --> 03:26.136
I probably would have said
a road trip to Rosarito

03:26.216 --> 03:28.776
or Rush Week at SC
meeting college boys...

03:28.856 --> 03:30.856
And waiting to get
charged with manslaughter?

03:30.936 --> 03:32.376
Wouldn't have
made the list.

03:32.416 --> 03:33.616
Mm-mm.

03:33.696 --> 03:36.456
You're gonna get
through this, Coop.

03:36.536 --> 03:37.536
You're innocent.

03:37.576 --> 03:38.896
You were saving
Ryan's life.

03:38.976 --> 03:40.456
Try explaining that to Ryan.

03:40.536 --> 03:42.136
He understands why you did it.

03:42.216 --> 03:43.256
He's not mad.

03:43.296 --> 03:44.856
It's just like this weird,

03:44.936 --> 03:46.976
horrible thing hanging over us,

03:47.056 --> 03:49.536
like, the elephant in the room.

03:49.616 --> 03:51.056
Or in the intensive care unit.

03:51.096 --> 03:54.376
Before Trey, I never actually
knew anyone in a coma.

03:54.416 --> 03:56.016
Well, I mean,
on The Valley, there's

03:56.096 --> 03:57.376
someone in a coma
like every week,

03:57.416 --> 03:58.736
but I think they only
do that so that

03:58.816 --> 04:01.096
when the person wakes up
another actor can play the part.

04:01.176 --> 04:05.096
Unfortunately, if Trey wakes up,
he's still gonna be Trey.

04:05.176 --> 04:07.016
If he wakes up.

04:07.096 --> 04:09.456
You got to admit, Coop,
whatever happens,

04:09.536 --> 04:11.616
Ryan facing off with Trey
to avenge your honor--

04:11.696 --> 04:14.776
God, that is
so freaking hot.

04:17.176 --> 04:20.815
In a mythic, Biblical,
Samurai-Western kind of way.

04:20.856 --> 04:23.216
I really wish that helped me
sleep at night, Summer.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.056
You're still not sleeping?

04:25.136 --> 04:27.216
I shot someone, Summ,

04:27.296 --> 04:29.976
and even if he lives,
which is a big "if,"

04:30.056 --> 04:31.296
I'm still going to have
to live with that

04:31.376 --> 04:32.296
for the rest of my life.

04:34.096 --> 04:37.096
Oh, senior year.

04:37.176 --> 04:39.376
Should be all-time.

04:39.456 --> 04:41.536
Yeah.

04:44.776 --> 04:46.296
Thanks a bunch, Sandy.

04:46.336 --> 04:47.856
If a pot and a
half isn't enough

04:47.936 --> 04:49.376
to get you through
the morning,

04:49.456 --> 04:50.496
I can make some more.

04:50.576 --> 04:51.496
That'd be great.

04:54.616 --> 04:57.016
Sorry for the mess,
it's been a little hectic.

04:57.056 --> 04:58.256
Seth'll be right down.

04:58.296 --> 04:59.216
And Mr. Atwood?

04:59.256 --> 05:00.376
He's getting
dressed.

05:00.456 --> 05:01.816
You know, the kids
have been through

05:01.896 --> 05:03.056
a lot this summer,
with all this

05:03.096 --> 05:04.696
hanging over them,
and now school is starting.

05:04.776 --> 05:06.336
Which is why the D.A.
wants to get moving.

05:06.416 --> 05:07.536
We waited
as long as we could

05:07.616 --> 05:09.176
for the other Mr. Atwood
to wake up, but...

05:09.256 --> 05:10.936
we're getting
a lot of calls from parents.

05:11.016 --> 05:12.816
The D.A.'s under a lot
of pressure to prosecute.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.216
Except there's nothing
to prosecute.

05:14.296 --> 05:16.696
Marissa's protected
under "the defense of others."

05:16.736 --> 05:19.096
Of course, your boss
may not find that very sexy.

05:19.136 --> 05:22.016
Or true. The D.A.'s not looking
to go after Marissa.

05:22.976 --> 05:24.296
Ryan's innocent.

05:24.376 --> 05:26.616
You got his statement
at the scene, and hers.

05:26.696 --> 05:28.376
Look at the
record Ryan's got.

05:28.456 --> 05:30.656
His history of violence,
and Caleb Nichol's daughter's

05:30.736 --> 05:31.856
the one blowing away ex-cons

05:31.896 --> 05:32.816
with a .45?

05:32.856 --> 05:33.776
She saved Ryan's life.

05:33.816 --> 05:34.696
What was he doing over.

05:34.736 --> 05:35.896
at Trey's in the first place?

05:35.976 --> 05:36.976
His brother tried to rape

05:37.056 --> 05:37.936
his girlfriend.

05:38.016 --> 05:38.896
We've got cause.

05:38.976 --> 05:40.496
Yeah, and you got witnesses.

05:40.576 --> 05:42.656
The only people who
saw the gun go off

05:42.696 --> 05:45.136
were Mr. Atwood, Miss Cooper,
and the other Mr. Atwood--

05:45.216 --> 05:46.816
who may or may not wake up.

05:46.856 --> 05:47.976
If you go after Ryan,

05:48.016 --> 05:50.136
even if he's brought in
on charges,

05:50.216 --> 05:52.496
Social Services could
take him away from us.

05:52.576 --> 05:54.856
Which explains Miss Cooper's
motivation to cover for him.

05:54.936 --> 05:56.896
Mr. Atwood's got
a lot more to lose.

05:59.176 --> 06:00.816
Where is
your wife anyway?

06:02.296 --> 06:03.896
She's out of town.

06:06.656 --> 06:09.536
My name is Kirsten
and I'm an alcoholic.

06:09.616 --> 06:11.176
GROUP:
Hello, Kirsten.

06:11.216 --> 06:13.376
Kirsten, your progress
here at Suriak has been

06:13.456 --> 06:14.936
truly wonderful to watch.

06:15.016 --> 06:16.936
You're a model patient
for everyone here.

06:17.016 --> 06:18.576
Well, I don't
know about that,

06:18.656 --> 06:20.536
I mean, Shelly is
definitely better

06:20.616 --> 06:22.856
at poker. She's
cleaned me out.

06:22.936 --> 06:24.496
( people laughing )

06:24.576 --> 06:27.176
But... being here

06:27.256 --> 06:29.416
has given me
the clarity to understand

06:29.496 --> 06:31.696
why I turned to alcohol
in the first place.

06:31.776 --> 06:33.296
And do you feel comfortable

06:33.376 --> 06:35.696
sharing with the group, uh...
why that was?

06:35.736 --> 06:37.296
Uh, sure.

06:37.336 --> 06:39.096
I mean, we're all
in this together.

06:39.176 --> 06:44.536
I, uh, I guess it begins
and ends with my dad.

06:45.816 --> 06:47.936
He was...

06:48.016 --> 06:49.376
an amazing man.

06:49.456 --> 06:51.576
But controlling,

06:51.656 --> 06:54.536
and... I realized
that I was living

06:54.576 --> 06:55.816
his life, not mine.

06:55.896 --> 06:58.456
After my mother
died, I did

06:58.536 --> 07:02.176
everything I could
to please him,

07:02.216 --> 07:03.656
but I realized
that no matter

07:03.736 --> 07:05.856
how hard I worked or
how hard I tried...

07:05.936 --> 07:06.936
It was never enough.

07:07.696 --> 07:09.176
I'm sorry.

07:09.216 --> 07:11.096
No. No, it's true.

07:11.136 --> 07:12.256
It was never enough.

07:12.336 --> 07:13.936
Became my mantra.

07:15.216 --> 07:18.296
I was never a good
enough wife-- or mom,

07:18.376 --> 07:20.416
because I wasn't a
good enough daughter.

07:20.496 --> 07:25.096
The power that comes with that
kind of difficult realization

07:25.136 --> 07:26.496
will be invaluable

07:26.536 --> 07:27.456
after you leave us.

07:27.496 --> 07:29.056
Are you trying to get rid of me?

07:29.096 --> 07:30.256
Well...

07:30.336 --> 07:32.936
it sounds to me
like Suriak's work is done.

07:32.976 --> 07:35.256
You'll need
to get a sponsor,

07:35.296 --> 07:37.056
attend meetings,

07:37.096 --> 07:39.296
but there's no reason you can't
do that from your home.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.376
Great.

07:42.816 --> 07:44.216
Mr. Atwood,

07:44.256 --> 07:46.016
do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth,

07:46.096 --> 07:47.696
so help you God?
I do.

07:47.736 --> 07:50.696
Well, you won't mind if
I record this deposition.

07:50.776 --> 07:52.256
Sure, record it,
release it on iTunes

07:52.336 --> 07:53.536
I hope it's
a really big hit.

07:53.616 --> 07:54.896
Just answer the questions.

07:54.936 --> 07:56.896
I've already answered
all these questions.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.576
I have nothing new to say.

07:58.656 --> 07:59.816
Well, your
previous statement

07:59.856 --> 08:00.856
came at the hospital.

08:00.936 --> 08:01.896
It was traumatic.

08:01.976 --> 08:03.096
It's been a
couple of months.

08:03.176 --> 08:04.976
Maybe you remember things
differently now.

08:05.056 --> 08:06.376
I remember everything
exactly as I told you.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.176
Well, then you can
tell me again.

08:10.216 --> 08:13.256
I...

08:13.336 --> 08:15.176
confronted Trey
about what had happened,

08:15.256 --> 08:17.696
and that's when
he pulled the gun on me.

08:17.776 --> 08:19.136
Then we called Marissa

08:19.216 --> 08:21.336
to see if maybe
she could stop Ryan.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.456
And that's when
Marissa saved my life.

08:24.536 --> 08:27.096
You mean that's when
Marissa shot Trey.

08:27.176 --> 08:29.216
And you witnessed
the shooting?

08:29.296 --> 08:31.256
It was clear when we got there
what had happened.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.655
Just answer the question.

08:32.736 --> 08:35.216
No, I did not, I did...

08:35.256 --> 08:36.416
I-I didn't shoot him.

08:36.456 --> 08:37.535
Your fingerprints
were on the gun.

08:37.576 --> 08:38.936
Yeah, because I
put the safety back on

08:39.015 --> 08:40.376
to make sure
it didn't go off again.

08:43.015 --> 08:45.976
We weren't exactly thinking
at the time.

08:46.016 --> 08:47.176
So one final question.

08:47.256 --> 08:49.256
What were you afraid
was going to happen

08:49.336 --> 08:50.936
between Ryan and his brother?

08:50.976 --> 08:54.376
Why were you
trying to stop him?

08:56.336 --> 08:58.216
You went to
Trey's that night

08:58.296 --> 08:59.536
to kill your brother,

08:59.576 --> 09:02.776
didn't you, Mr. Atwood?

09:02.816 --> 09:03.816
( clicks off )

09:07.856 --> 09:09.096
So what kind of food

09:09.136 --> 09:11.856
do you think prosecutors like?

09:11.936 --> 09:13.736
'Cause that's what's
important here, Jimmy?

09:13.776 --> 09:14.856
Okay.

09:14.896 --> 09:16.336
So does this look
like the outfit

09:16.416 --> 09:18.216
the mother of an
innocent girl would wear?

09:18.296 --> 09:20.936
Well, at least somebody
has their priorities in order.

09:21.016 --> 09:22.656
( sighs )
I just hope Marissa

09:22.736 --> 09:24.536
listens to me
and our attorney.

09:24.576 --> 09:26.416
The last thing
we need is her
admitting to the DA

09:26.496 --> 09:28.136
that she
shot someone.
Jules.

09:28.216 --> 09:29.776
She already admitted it.

09:29.816 --> 09:31.216
She wasn't in her
right frame of mind

09:31.256 --> 09:32.456
when she spoke
to the police.

09:32.536 --> 09:34.296
It's not like she's
a trained assassin.

09:34.376 --> 09:35.976
Uh-huh, so-so what's our story?

09:36.056 --> 09:38.656
Trey shot himself in the back?

09:38.736 --> 09:40.496
No, Jimmy.
Be reasonable.

09:40.576 --> 09:42.096
She's not gonna lie
and say Ryan did it.

09:42.176 --> 09:43.456
They already have her statement.

09:43.536 --> 09:44.776
Nobody believes her.

09:44.816 --> 09:46.176
They all think
she's protecting him.

09:46.216 --> 09:48.816
So you want Ryan
to go away for this?

09:48.896 --> 09:51.696
All I know is that
before he moved to Newport,

09:51.776 --> 09:54.056
our lives were
a lot more normal, stable.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.456
Uh-huh, so it's his fault

09:55.496 --> 09:57.496
that I went bankrupt
and nearly went to jail,

09:57.536 --> 09:58.976
and you married Caleb Nichol

09:59.016 --> 10:00.496
and later watched him drown
in a pool,

10:00.576 --> 10:01.856
and Trey got shot.

10:01.896 --> 10:04.376
Jimmy, not everything
I say is meant literally.

10:04.416 --> 10:05.576
I'm venting.

10:05.656 --> 10:07.256
Look, I wish none of this
ever happened,

10:07.296 --> 10:08.376
but it did.

10:08.416 --> 10:11.136
And we have a chance
to be a family again.

10:11.216 --> 10:14.096
I don't want to lose that.

10:15.856 --> 10:16.896
Look...

10:16.976 --> 10:18.336
put out some crudete
and the Gouda.

10:18.416 --> 10:20.256
I'll go see if Marissa's
out of the shower.

10:25.496 --> 10:27.216
SETH:
Hey, are you decent?

10:27.296 --> 10:28.776
I thought maybe you could

10:28.816 --> 10:30.696
use a post-depo dip.

10:30.776 --> 10:31.576
I just showered.

10:31.616 --> 10:33.696
Hmm. A fair point then.

10:33.776 --> 10:35.216
We'll stay away from
aquatic activities,

10:35.296 --> 10:36.376
something
landlocked, maybe.

10:36.416 --> 10:37.376
I'm gonna visit Trey.

10:37.456 --> 10:38.856
I was gonna go with a movie.

10:38.936 --> 10:40.056
This being the time

10:40.096 --> 10:41.416
when Hollywood
dumps their

10:41.496 --> 10:43.256
crappy would-be blockbusters,
which we could mock

10:43.336 --> 10:45.376
and thus feel better
about ourselves.

10:45.456 --> 10:46.416
You got the keys?

10:46.456 --> 10:48.616
But... visiting your
comatose brother

10:48.656 --> 10:50.256
in the ICU, that's...

10:50.336 --> 10:52.256
also an excellent way to
relax and blow off steam,

10:52.336 --> 10:54.496
so I'll drive.
Awesome.

10:56.536 --> 10:59.536
Oh, Mr. Caldwell, would you like
some more lemonade?

10:59.616 --> 11:01.776
Mr. Esbenshade?

11:01.856 --> 11:03.696
Come on. It's okay

11:03.776 --> 11:05.216
for a prosecutor
and defense attorney

11:05.296 --> 11:07.016
to have a glass of lemonade
together.

11:07.096 --> 11:08.456
We're all
human beings here.

11:08.536 --> 11:11.296
I'm not so sure
about these guys.

11:11.336 --> 11:15.456
Miss Cooper,
I'm Deputy District
Attorney Chris Caldwell.

11:15.536 --> 11:16.656
I'll be conducting
this deposition.

11:16.696 --> 11:19.256
Hi. Uh, where do you want
us to sit?

11:19.296 --> 11:21.016
Actually, Miss Roberts
can't be present.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.256
We wouldn't want you
influencing your testimony.

11:23.336 --> 11:25.616
She knows what you know,
which is the truth.

11:25.656 --> 11:27.856
Which is what
I already told you people.

11:27.936 --> 11:30.256
Miss Roberts, if you could
please wait inside.

11:32.256 --> 11:32.976
Summer,

11:33.056 --> 11:34.096
we have HBO On Demand;

11:34.176 --> 11:35.656
every season
of Sex In The City.

11:35.736 --> 11:36.776
Knock yourself out.

11:39.456 --> 11:41.056
Marissa, it'll be okay.
I'm just going to wait inside.

11:41.136 --> 11:43.496
Look, I already told everybody
everything.

11:43.576 --> 11:46.176
I don't want to have
to go through this again;

11:46.256 --> 11:47.696
talk about all of it
in front of all these strangers?

11:47.776 --> 11:48.736
Marissa, I need
to remind you

11:48.816 --> 11:50.776
this deposition
is binding.

11:50.856 --> 11:52.336
Your testimony in court
can't waver

11:52.376 --> 11:53.696
from what is said here.

11:53.776 --> 11:55.616
I already told the truth,
so what's the problem?

11:55.696 --> 11:57.936
The problem, Miss Cooper,
is that your testimony

11:57.976 --> 11:59.776
lacks credibility.

12:01.576 --> 12:04.856
Miss Roberts,
please wait inside.

12:04.936 --> 12:07.216
Come on, Summer.

12:07.296 --> 12:09.056
Now, Miss Cooper,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.136
I'm going to have
to swear you in.

12:13.176 --> 12:14.976
JULIE:
It'll be okay, Marissa.

12:22.376 --> 12:23.816
I kind of like him
this way.

12:23.896 --> 12:26.776
He's a better listener.

12:26.856 --> 12:28.896
Sorry.

12:28.976 --> 12:30.896
I get talkative
around coma patients.

12:30.936 --> 12:32.816
It's a compensation thing.

12:32.896 --> 12:34.056
I'll give you guys a minute.

12:34.096 --> 12:35.336
Wait just a...

12:50.376 --> 12:53.376
Sorry, man,
I don't even know
why I came here.

12:53.416 --> 12:55.136
That night I wanted
to kill him.

12:55.216 --> 12:56.856
Now I'd do anything
to take it back.

12:56.896 --> 12:58.176
Well, you can't
blame yourself

12:58.256 --> 12:59.576
and you can't change
what happened.

12:59.616 --> 13:01.336
Yeah, but I mean,
Trey could have tried
to make it work.

13:01.376 --> 13:04.776
Living in town,
I mean, I could of
had my brother here.

13:04.856 --> 13:05.816
Everything's screwed up

13:05.896 --> 13:07.216
and he's the only family
I got left.

13:07.256 --> 13:09.696
That's not exactly true.

13:25.278 --> 13:28.898
Okay, you have to say that I still support
the recent decision

13:29.078 --> 13:32.558
in the wake of
all the violence
we've experienced

13:32.598 --> 13:34.718
to ban any games
with ninjas or guns.

13:34.798 --> 13:36.238
Yeah, but...?

13:36.278 --> 13:39.478
Well, it's just
I don't understand
any of the rules

13:39.558 --> 13:42.078
to this "baseball"
they call it.

13:42.158 --> 13:44.038
You mean,
America's pastime?

13:44.118 --> 13:46.838
Feels like more
of a fad to me, buddy.

13:46.918 --> 13:48.398
I don't really see
it catching on.

13:48.478 --> 13:49.438
Sure.

13:49.478 --> 13:51.118
You called Marissa
and Summer, right?

13:51.198 --> 13:52.718
They're with
the Dark Lord Sauron

13:52.798 --> 13:54.878
or whatever the
D.A.'s name is.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.878
Did that guy blink once
during the deposition?

13:56.918 --> 13:58.838
He didn't even
have eyelids.

13:58.918 --> 14:00.518
( phone ringing )

14:00.598 --> 14:02.358
Hello?

14:02.438 --> 14:04.118
I'm sorry.
He's not in right now.

14:04.198 --> 14:06.078
Can I take a message?

14:06.158 --> 14:08.478
COMMENTATOR:
Dallas McPherson will stand in.
0 for 2 thus far.

14:08.518 --> 14:11.198
Okay, thank you.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.478
That was the hospital.
Trey woke up.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.238
Kirsten, right?

14:20.278 --> 14:22.318
Hi, I'm Charlotte Morgan.

14:22.358 --> 14:24.118
I'm so sorry about
interrupting you in group.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.718
Oh, no, no, that's okay.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.838
When I heard you talking,
it was like you were
describing my life.

14:28.878 --> 14:30.678
Rich, dominating father,
the high pressure.

14:30.758 --> 14:32.438
Nothing was ever good enough.

14:32.518 --> 14:34.278
Well, I'm just glad
I didn't bore you.

14:34.318 --> 14:36.038
It was amazing,
I mean,

14:36.118 --> 14:37.718
to hear someone
on the same journey as me.

14:37.758 --> 14:39.758
Well, obviously,
you're a little further along.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.478
I could never have
admitted all that.

14:41.558 --> 14:43.518
Well...
You're so brave
and honest.

14:43.598 --> 14:46.158
I don't know about
that, but thank you.

14:46.198 --> 14:47.718
Do you want to maybe get
coffee sometime?

14:47.798 --> 14:49.358
We can talk trash
about our dads.

14:49.398 --> 14:51.358
Sure, I'd love to.

14:51.438 --> 14:52.558
Okay.

14:53.878 --> 14:55.718
Ah, that's my husband.

14:55.758 --> 14:58.358
Oh, well, I don't want
to take up any more
of your time.

14:58.438 --> 15:00.598
Bye.
Bye.

15:03.078 --> 15:04.478
Look at you.

15:14.438 --> 15:16.718
So it exploded all
over the kitchen?

15:16.798 --> 15:18.398
Ah, the microwave mostly.

15:18.438 --> 15:20.038
An entire jar
of peanut butter?

15:20.078 --> 15:21.238
We were trying to make
peanut butter cookies

15:21.318 --> 15:22.598
as a surprise for you.

15:22.638 --> 15:25.558
It seemed like
such a good idea
at the time.

15:25.598 --> 15:27.478
Well, it is a well-known
science factoid

15:27.518 --> 15:29.038
that metal plus heat
equals...

15:29.118 --> 15:31.238
Peanut butter everywhere.

15:31.318 --> 15:32.998
And these are just
a few of the lessons

15:33.078 --> 15:35.238
we three struggling,
handsome bachelors

15:35.318 --> 15:36.558
are learning every week.

15:36.598 --> 15:38.718
It sound like you
have a reality series here.

15:38.798 --> 15:41.238
Oh, I hope
it's not a reality for too long.

15:44.718 --> 15:48.638
So... you should
be coming home any
day now, right?

15:48.678 --> 15:51.158
Just give me a heads up
so I can make sure

15:51.198 --> 15:53.918
the house is livable.

15:53.998 --> 15:56.158
Yeah, I just have to sit down
with Dr. Woodruff soon

15:56.238 --> 15:57.638
and see what's
going on.

15:57.718 --> 15:59.158
See if I'm eligible.

16:02.398 --> 16:03.758
( phone rings )

16:04.798 --> 16:07.678
Ooh. Hey, Seth,
I'm here with Mom.

16:09.838 --> 16:12.118
Huh.

16:12.158 --> 16:14.558
Well, thanks for calling.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.238
I'll see you
when I get back to the house.

16:17.718 --> 16:18.798
Is everything okay?

16:18.838 --> 16:22.678
Yeah. He says hi,
that he misses you.

16:22.718 --> 16:25.478
I better get going,
get back to work.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.678
Just let me know
what the doctor says.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.198
Yeah.
All right.

16:53.238 --> 16:55.398
Hey. So what's going on?

16:56.918 --> 16:58.118
Trey's awake.

16:58.198 --> 16:59.918
Oh, my God.

16:59.998 --> 17:01.718
When did he...?

17:01.758 --> 17:03.918
Couldn't have been too long.
I just saw him.

17:03.998 --> 17:05.117
You saw him?

17:05.198 --> 17:08.038
Yeah, I've been up there
a couple times, you know.

17:08.117 --> 17:09.478
I didn't know.

17:09.558 --> 17:10.958
Hey, I would have gone with you.

17:10.998 --> 17:13.038
No, no, you shouldn't
have to see him ever again.

17:13.078 --> 17:15.598
I don't have the same choice.

17:18.558 --> 17:20.038
Well, I mean, I guess
now that he's awake,

17:20.117 --> 17:22.198
he can tell the lawyers
what really happened.

17:22.278 --> 17:23.838
I mean, Trey got us
into this mess.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.198
Hopefully, he can get us out.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.078
Yeah. Our future's in
Trey's hands.

17:30.398 --> 17:33.078
Come on. Seth and Summer
are at the diner.

17:40.718 --> 17:43.078
What do you mean
it's going to take two months?

17:43.118 --> 17:45.558
Caleb wrote a will.
Just read it already.

17:45.638 --> 17:47.838
It's much more difficult
than that, Mrs. Cooper Nichol.

17:47.918 --> 17:50.838
as you can see
there's a lot of paperwork,

17:50.878 --> 17:52.358
a number of different
offshore accounts

17:52.438 --> 17:53.878
we haven't yet found.

17:53.918 --> 17:56.358
Okay, well, you just take
your sweet time, Mr. Frankel,

17:56.438 --> 17:57.558
but understand this:

17:57.638 --> 18:00.318
we are paying a very high-priced
defense attorney

18:00.398 --> 18:02.038
to protect our daughter,
and right now the meter's
running.

18:02.118 --> 18:02.958
I wish I could help.

18:08.678 --> 18:10.078
I'm a grieving widow.

18:11.878 --> 18:13.238
Clearly.

18:13.278 --> 18:15.758
You've seen the will,
haven't you, Joe?

18:15.838 --> 18:18.318
Why don't you just tell us
what's in it

18:18.358 --> 18:19.678
and it'll be our little secret?

18:19.758 --> 18:21.038
I can't do that.

18:21.078 --> 18:22.958
It's our attorney,
Julie.

18:23.038 --> 18:24.638
Let's play hot-cold, hmm?

18:24.718 --> 18:25.638
$2 million?

18:26.598 --> 18:27.878
$7 million?

18:27.918 --> 18:30.078
I have at least
$3 million coming
from my prenup.

18:30.118 --> 18:31.558
You blinked.
Does one blink mean yes?

18:31.598 --> 18:33.358
Julie, the hospital called.

18:33.438 --> 18:35.878
What? What did they say?

18:46.958 --> 18:49.558
Okay, I have an idea.

18:49.638 --> 18:50.838
Are you going to save
Chrismukkah again?

18:50.918 --> 18:51.838
'Cause I really enjoyed
that last time.

18:54.118 --> 18:55.318
We need to have some fun.

18:55.398 --> 18:56.598
Fun?

18:56.678 --> 18:58.638
Yeah. Look,
we can't control
the future, right?

18:58.718 --> 18:59.998
So how do we deal?

19:00.038 --> 19:01.558
I mean, we can do
what my stepmother does

19:01.598 --> 19:03.798
and take lots of painkillers
to number ourselves

19:03.838 --> 19:04.998
from the reality
that life is,

19:05.078 --> 19:07.118
well, random, unfair
and ultimately meaningless.

19:07.158 --> 19:08.958
There's another option, right?

19:09.038 --> 19:10.878
Or we can accept the fact
that we can't worry

19:10.958 --> 19:11.998
about what we can't control

19:12.078 --> 19:13.838
and just enjoy the time
that we have.

19:13.878 --> 19:16.998
Trey's awake and school
is starting soon.

19:17.038 --> 19:19.158
who knows
what's to come, right?

19:19.238 --> 19:22.078
So this might be our last chance
to have fun.

19:22.118 --> 19:23.878
I like plan "B."

19:24.638 --> 19:25.678
So what do we do?

19:25.758 --> 19:27.838
Well, I have an idea,

19:27.918 --> 19:29.878
but I'd have
to ask my dad first.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.438
Mr. Cooper's got a nice boat,
huh?

20:18.518 --> 20:20.918
Yeah, it's amazing
what laundered
money can buy.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.478
You know, Cohen,
with your two hands on the wheel

20:23.558 --> 20:25.518
and the wind blowing
through your hair,

20:25.598 --> 20:26.838
you actually look kind of hot.

20:26.918 --> 20:27.998
Let me guess, Summer.

20:28.038 --> 20:29.998
You have a weakness for seamen?

20:30.078 --> 20:31.518
Ew, Cohen!
Yeah?

20:31.558 --> 20:32.678
And then
there's that.

20:32.758 --> 20:33.958
Yeah? Oh.

20:35.638 --> 20:37.198
Hey.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.638
Hey.

20:41.238 --> 20:42.998
So, how you
doing? You okay?

20:43.038 --> 20:45.518
Yeah, I guess.

20:45.598 --> 20:47.358
I mean, I don't know,
to be honest.

20:47.438 --> 20:48.278
Are we okay?

20:48.358 --> 20:50.278
Yeah, sure.

20:50.318 --> 20:52.118
Why wouldn't we be?

20:52.198 --> 20:53.638
'Cause since that night,

20:53.678 --> 20:55.398
we haven't really talked
about it.

20:57.158 --> 20:58.398
SETH:
Hey,

20:58.438 --> 20:59.438
knock it off.
Listen,

20:59.518 --> 21:00.678
get your mind
off everything.

21:00.758 --> 21:02.438
Who wants to
go fishing?

21:02.518 --> 21:04.558
Yeah, you guys do the hunting,
we'll do the gathering.

21:04.598 --> 21:07.758
Fishing. I like that idea,
but we don't have any bait.

21:07.798 --> 21:08.918
Oh. Yeah, wait.

21:08.998 --> 21:09.878
No, we have Summer.

21:09.958 --> 21:10.998
Look at this
little sardine.

21:11.078 --> 21:12.038
No!

21:12.078 --> 21:12.998
You guys,
that's not funny.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.118
Look at this
little sardine.

21:14.198 --> 21:14.878
Don't. No! No!
Who wants to go...?

21:14.918 --> 21:16.718
Who wants to go...?

21:16.798 --> 21:17.758
Stop, Ryan.

21:17.798 --> 21:21.118
( girls squealing and laughing )

21:35.398 --> 21:39.278
( girls squealing and giggling )

21:53.118 --> 21:54.838
MARISSA:
Well,

21:54.918 --> 21:56.598
if this is as good
as it gets for a while...

21:56.638 --> 21:58.198
Yeah, it was
pretty good.

21:58.278 --> 22:02.158
Yeah, thanks for almost
getting my bathing
suit wet, Cohen.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.358
My pleasure.

22:03.398 --> 22:04.798
( mocking Summer ):
Cohen,

22:04.838 --> 22:06.918
I can't believe that
you did that, Cohen.

22:06.998 --> 22:08.478
( laughter )

22:44.918 --> 22:48.038
JULIE:
I'm looking for
Trey Atwood.

22:48.078 --> 22:49.518
I'm sorry.

22:49.598 --> 22:51.318
Visiting hours ended
a while ago.

22:51.398 --> 22:53.118
Oh, did I forget
to introduce myself?

22:53.158 --> 22:54.438
I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol,

22:54.478 --> 22:56.678
as in the Nichol wing
of this hospital

22:56.758 --> 22:57.998
which we're both standing in.

22:58.078 --> 23:01.518
Oh. Hello, Mrs. Cooper-Nichol.

23:01.598 --> 23:03.998
My husband
was very philanthropic.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.518
Hospitals
were his favorite charity--

23:05.558 --> 23:07.918
especially making sure
nurses and orderlies

23:07.998 --> 23:10.318
were compensated
for their hard work.

23:10.358 --> 23:13.478
I would hate to
see his passion
fall by the wayside.

23:23.518 --> 23:25.318
( startled audible breath )

23:25.398 --> 23:27.198
Hello, Trey.

23:27.278 --> 23:29.318
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

23:30.838 --> 23:32.758
Uh...

23:32.838 --> 23:35.638
Oh, no, no-- no pleasantries.

23:35.718 --> 23:36.878
Look at you,

23:36.958 --> 23:39.558
lying there all helpless.

23:41.718 --> 23:45.318
Unable to stop me
from doing whatever

23:45.398 --> 23:47.478
I wanted to.

23:49.278 --> 23:51.398
Kind of like the night
you tried to rape my daughter.

23:54.358 --> 23:56.998
I'm sorry.

23:57.038 --> 23:59.518
Well, you should be,
you son of a bitch.

23:59.598 --> 24:02.278
Which is why
you're going to help me.

24:02.318 --> 24:05.278
In exchange, I'm prepared
to compensate you.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.518
How does $20,000 sound?

24:07.558 --> 24:10.918
( scoffing )

24:10.998 --> 24:12.998
What... do you want?

24:13.078 --> 24:14.398
Three simple words.

24:14.478 --> 24:17.398
Repeat after me, Trey.

24:17.478 --> 24:21.038
Ryan shot me.

24:23.758 --> 24:25.478
Trey...

24:29.478 --> 24:33.398
( audible swallow
and soft, mirthless chuckle )

24:33.438 --> 24:36.438
"Ryan...

24:36.478 --> 24:38.518
shot me."

24:46.866 --> 24:47.826
SETH:
Okay, so,

24:47.866 --> 24:48.706
I know Teen Wolf

24:48.746 --> 24:50.146
is not a realistic movie.

24:50.226 --> 24:52.346
We're going
out on a limb here, but yeah.

24:52.426 --> 24:54.266
Well... I mean,

24:54.346 --> 24:55.626
how does being
a werewolf

24:55.706 --> 24:57.826
make you a better
basketball player?

24:57.906 --> 25:00.306
Can't argue that one.

25:00.386 --> 25:02.666
SANDY:
Hey, fellas, you mind
shutting off the TV?

25:05.986 --> 25:08.146
Trey talked
to the police this morning,

25:08.186 --> 25:12.186
and he confirmed their suspicion
that it was you who shot him.

25:12.226 --> 25:13.506
Well, that's
a total lie.

25:13.586 --> 25:15.706
SANDY:
Now, the D.A.'s office
gave me a heads-up.

25:15.786 --> 25:18.146
They're going to be issuing
a warrant for your arrest

25:18.186 --> 25:19.186
in a few hours.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.586
We're going
to figure this thing out.

25:20.626 --> 25:21.826
But I need to know

25:21.906 --> 25:23.946
that you are telling me
everything that happened.

25:31.226 --> 25:32.306
What difference does it make?

25:36.746 --> 25:38.826
You're going to fix this, right?

25:44.468 --> 25:46.208
A little early
for champagne,
don't you think?

25:46.484 --> 25:48.824
I'm making mimosas--
they're breakfast-appropriate.

25:49.004 --> 25:51.404
Besides,
we should celebrate.

25:51.484 --> 25:53.804
Celebrate the fact
that Marissa's boyfriend

25:53.844 --> 25:55.404
is getting arrested?

25:55.484 --> 25:57.244
No, the fact that Marissa isn't.

25:57.284 --> 25:59.404
You know, Julie,
it's just a little

25:59.444 --> 26:00.084
too convenient.

26:00.164 --> 26:01.644
Trey wakes up

26:01.724 --> 26:03.444
and immediately
points the finger at Ryan?

26:03.484 --> 26:05.324
Well, sometimes, Jimmy--

26:05.404 --> 26:07.524
and I know you don't have
that much experience with this--

26:07.604 --> 26:10.004
but... things work out.

26:10.084 --> 26:14.324
You know, even if
Marissa was accused,

26:14.364 --> 26:15.564
she wouldn't go to jail.

26:15.604 --> 26:17.164
She also wouldn't be going
to college.

26:17.204 --> 26:19.044
Forget what the law says

26:19.124 --> 26:20.564
about just cause
in defense of others.

26:20.604 --> 26:22.484
How's it going to look
on her college application

26:22.564 --> 26:24.724
under extracurriculars--
"Shoots blue collar thugs"?

26:24.804 --> 26:27.044
Look, I don't want Marissa to
suffer either, but Ryan...

26:27.124 --> 26:28.804
Ryan's die was cast

26:28.844 --> 26:31.004
long before he moved
into the Cohen pool house.

26:31.084 --> 26:33.284
Look, Jimmy,
let's just put this to bed.

26:33.324 --> 26:34.844
We'll collect on Caleb's will,

26:34.884 --> 26:37.484
and we'll go back to being
a normal, happy family.

26:37.524 --> 26:39.084
MARISSA:
Hey, what's for breakfast?

26:39.164 --> 26:41.004
JIMMY:
Hey, kiddo, what
are you doing up?

26:41.084 --> 26:42.084
I can't sleep.

26:42.164 --> 26:44.484
Oh. Well, I have news

26:44.524 --> 26:46.884
that's very
good for us.

26:46.964 --> 26:50.364
It's just...
not so good for Ryan.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.164
SETH:
Well, I know he wants
to be left alone.

26:54.204 --> 26:55.844
We have
to do something.

26:55.884 --> 26:57.124
Should we bring him
a snack?

26:57.204 --> 26:58.364
What does Ryan eat?

26:58.404 --> 27:00.324
Dry cereal from a
box and black coffee.

27:00.404 --> 27:02.124
Huh.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.484
Well, maybe we could get him
something, like a gift.

27:04.564 --> 27:05.564
Sure. Money's no object.

27:05.644 --> 27:07.684
Okay. What does Ryan like?

27:07.724 --> 27:10.284
Hmm.

27:10.364 --> 27:13.924
Any favorite movies, hobbies?

27:14.004 --> 27:15.964
Cohen, he's your best friend.

27:16.044 --> 27:17.524
Hey, you've known
him as long as me.

27:17.564 --> 27:19.084
I don't hear
you throwing
out any gems.

27:19.164 --> 27:20.484
Well, we can't just

27:20.564 --> 27:23.124
leave him alone in there;
it's just terrible.

27:23.164 --> 27:25.884
I know, but who even knows
what to say to him?

27:25.924 --> 27:27.364
He's never
been arrested before...

27:27.444 --> 27:30.364
for attempted murder.

27:36.564 --> 27:37.844
Where is he?

27:37.884 --> 27:40.124
Uh, he's not really
seeing visitors right now.

27:40.204 --> 27:41.804
We're kind of giving
him his space.

27:41.884 --> 27:42.724
( sarcastic sigh )

27:42.804 --> 27:43.804
This should go well.

27:43.884 --> 27:46.244
Right behind you, Coop.

27:47.444 --> 27:48.444
Hey.

27:48.484 --> 27:49.724
Hey.

27:49.764 --> 27:51.884
Hoodie, wife-beater,
leather jacket.

27:51.964 --> 27:54.364
That's the Ryan Atwood
escapist ensemble.

27:54.404 --> 27:55.724
That's right;
doesn't matter what I say.

27:55.764 --> 27:57.204
No one's going
to believe me-- not anymore.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.684
Dude, you're not running away.

27:58.724 --> 27:59.924
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

27:59.964 --> 28:02.204
No, No, you're not.

28:03.604 --> 28:04.524
You're sailing...

28:04.604 --> 28:06.724
and we're coming with you.

28:08.324 --> 28:09.284
Yes.

28:09.324 --> 28:10.564
Since apparently

28:10.604 --> 28:12.284
there's boats involved,
which is my forte.

28:12.364 --> 28:14.844
Totally.
We all go down together.

28:17.444 --> 28:19.484
Thanks.

28:21.004 --> 28:22.724
Well, so, how was your
visit with your husband?

28:22.804 --> 28:23.924
He excited you're
coming home?

28:24.004 --> 28:25.004
Yes, he is.

28:25.084 --> 28:26.564
Didn't tell him
you're not

28:26.604 --> 28:28.604
ready yet, huh?

28:28.644 --> 28:30.164
Been there.

28:30.244 --> 28:32.684
Well, if Dr. Woodruff
says I'm ready,

28:32.764 --> 28:34.364
I must be ready.
Yeah, but Dr. Woodruff

28:34.444 --> 28:37.004
ain't going to be
in your kitchen at 3:00 a.m.

28:37.084 --> 28:38.524
when you're rooting around
in the spice rack

28:38.564 --> 28:39.604
for anything with alcohol,

28:39.644 --> 28:40.724
and start pounding
vanilla extract.

28:42.284 --> 28:45.684
Oh, God, I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.724
Is that what happened to you?

28:47.804 --> 28:49.844
It was cough syrup.

28:51.564 --> 28:54.724
That's my biggest fear--
that I'm not ready.

28:54.764 --> 28:56.884
And I'm not going back
to my husband and my boys

28:56.964 --> 29:00.044
until I know that I'll never
let them down again.

29:00.124 --> 29:02.804
Look, can I give you
some advice?

29:02.884 --> 29:04.564
It's not a race.

29:04.644 --> 29:06.764
Take all the time you need.

29:16.121 --> 29:17.841
Hello.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.201
I'm back.

29:34.001 --> 29:35.761
We're looking for Ryan Atwood.

29:35.801 --> 29:37.641
You're a little
late, I'm afraid.

29:43.081 --> 29:44.481
Nope, she's not here, either.

29:44.561 --> 29:46.641
And she left for your house
hours ago, Sandy.

29:46.681 --> 29:48.681
You don't think
they'd try anything, do you?

29:48.721 --> 29:50.201
What's going on?

29:50.241 --> 29:53.041
The cops are at Sandy's house;
the kids are gone.

29:53.121 --> 29:54.681
We don't know
where they went.

29:54.761 --> 29:56.881
SUMMER:
You don't think your dad
will miss the boat?

29:56.921 --> 29:59.521
MARISSA:
Well, he of all people
will understand.

29:59.561 --> 30:00.521
But we got to hurry.

30:00.601 --> 30:01.921
SETH:
Let's go.

30:01.961 --> 30:03.401
RYAN:
Hey, man,
how long is it to Catalina?

30:03.481 --> 30:04.561
About four hours;
then from there,

30:04.601 --> 30:06.121
we can go wherever you want--
Mexico, Hawaii.

30:06.201 --> 30:07.601
Hey, look, guys,
I got to say...

30:07.681 --> 30:10.001
you can get in a lot
of trouble for this,
so if you want

30:10.081 --> 30:11.281
to back out...
Are you kidding?

30:11.361 --> 30:12.481
This is a great excuse

30:12.561 --> 30:13.921
to skip school.

30:14.001 --> 30:16.041
It's just until we can get Trey
to change his story.

30:37.161 --> 30:39.121
Glad to see
the jumpsuit still fits.

30:41.161 --> 30:43.201
Well, kid,
for someone

30:43.241 --> 30:45.881
who's innocent, you done
a hell of a job to look guilty.

30:45.961 --> 30:48.161
I'm glad to see you're here
to make me feel better.

30:48.201 --> 30:49.801
No, I'm here to
tell you the truth,

30:49.841 --> 30:51.721
as your lawyer
and your guardian.

30:51.801 --> 30:53.121
The only person
who runs

30:53.161 --> 30:54.441
is somebody who's
got something to hide.

30:54.521 --> 30:55.601
Or who has no choice.

30:55.681 --> 30:59.401
I see how these cops and lawyers
look at me.

30:59.481 --> 31:02.041
My record, my family...

31:04.001 --> 31:06.041
And you know I'm right.

31:06.121 --> 31:07.761
This isn't over.

31:07.841 --> 31:09.281
The arraignment's
set for tomorrow.

31:09.361 --> 31:10.481
We're going to fight this.

31:12.081 --> 31:14.401
Trey could still
change his mind.

31:13.949 --> 31:15.469
Yeah.

31:15.549 --> 31:17.549
How's that gonna happen?

31:19.149 --> 31:20.909
I haven't worn
this candy stripers outfit

31:20.989 --> 31:22.949
since, like,
the tenth grade.

31:23.029 --> 31:24.989
Well, maybe we should
start volunteering again.

31:25.029 --> 31:25.989
It's good
for charity.

31:26.069 --> 31:27.109
Nothing against you guys

31:27.189 --> 31:28.789
wearing these uniforms,
'cause I'm not.

31:28.829 --> 31:31.949
But doesn't this plan
seem a little light-hearted,

31:32.029 --> 31:33.709
given the nature
of the predicament?

31:33.789 --> 31:35.309
Cohen, you're not
even part of the plan.

31:35.389 --> 31:36.549
We're letting you push a cart.

31:36.629 --> 31:38.629
Okay, Summ, you're on.

31:38.669 --> 31:40.189
Hey, Denise!

31:40.229 --> 31:41.389
How are you?!

31:41.469 --> 31:42.589
Summer Roberts.

31:42.629 --> 31:44.069
I haven't seen you in years.

31:44.149 --> 31:45.109
Where you been?

31:45.189 --> 31:47.189
Oh, I love helping sick people.

31:47.269 --> 31:49.909
It's just,
they kept making me sick.

31:49.989 --> 31:51.549
So, I've been reassigned
to gunshot victims,

31:51.589 --> 31:53.389
because you can't catch
one of those.

31:54.629 --> 31:56.709
Well, glad to have you back.

31:56.789 --> 31:58.269
Who do you want to see?

32:00.389 --> 32:01.709
( knock at door )

32:01.789 --> 32:03.709
I don't want to speak
to anyone else.

32:05.629 --> 32:08.029
Hey, did you hear what I...?

32:17.549 --> 32:22.229
Did you, uh...
come to finish the job?

32:23.869 --> 32:26.029
So, you do remember
it was me who shot you.

32:29.029 --> 32:31.349
( coughs )

32:31.429 --> 32:34.469
I'm trying to protect you.

32:34.549 --> 32:37.029
Protect me?

32:37.109 --> 32:38.709
By blaming Ryan?

32:38.789 --> 32:43.629
I'm sorry, Marissa...

32:43.669 --> 32:48.589
for... for everything.

32:48.629 --> 32:50.469
I...

32:52.629 --> 32:56.269
I just didn't know
how to make it right, and...

32:59.349 --> 33:03.549
and she offered me a way out.

33:05.509 --> 33:06.949
Who did?

33:09.229 --> 33:11.029
Your mom.

33:19.509 --> 33:23.069
Look, Trey...

33:24.469 --> 33:26.269
if you want to make it right,

33:26.309 --> 33:28.269
then there's only one thing
for you to do.

33:54.349 --> 33:55.749
Hey, Jimmy.

33:55.789 --> 33:57.269
Hey.

33:57.349 --> 33:58.909
Thanks for meeting me.

33:58.949 --> 34:00.549
Sure.
Sorry to hear about Ryan.

34:00.629 --> 34:02.349
Just when you thought
things couldn't get any worse.

34:02.429 --> 34:04.149
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

34:04.229 --> 34:05.429
I've been trying
to figure out

34:05.509 --> 34:07.869
why Trey would
try to frame Ryan.

34:07.949 --> 34:10.228
I know the kid's not
going to be sainted

34:10.309 --> 34:13.829
anytime soon,
but... still.

34:13.869 --> 34:16.109
The only thing
I can figure--

34:16.188 --> 34:18.188
somebody paid him.

34:20.029 --> 34:23.429
But who would
sink that low?

34:23.469 --> 34:26.349
Only one name came to mind.

34:29.869 --> 34:31.188
And you didn't
try to stop her.

34:31.228 --> 34:32.309
Look,

34:32.349 --> 34:33.949
I-I found out about it
too late.

34:34.029 --> 34:35.509
There was nothing I could do.

34:35.549 --> 34:37.668
Come on, Jimmy, at some point,
you got to do the right thing.

34:37.748 --> 34:39.949
You've got to understand
what I'm dealing with.

34:39.989 --> 34:41.109
Put yourself in my shoes.

34:41.188 --> 34:42.069
In your shoes?

34:42.149 --> 34:43.309
I got a wife in rehab

34:43.349 --> 34:45.188
who doesn't want to come home,

34:45.268 --> 34:47.589
and a kid who's been locked up
for something he didn't do.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.589
Your shoes are looking
pretty good right now.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.109
Look, I-I get it, I get it.

34:51.188 --> 34:52.989
I'm trying to protect
my family, too.

34:53.069 --> 34:54.109
Right.

34:54.188 --> 34:56.268
Because family
means so much to you.

34:56.309 --> 34:58.269
What's that supposed to mean?

34:58.349 --> 35:00.469
That means what
are you doing
back in Newport?

35:00.509 --> 35:02.989
Caleb dies, boom,
suddenly you show up.

35:03.069 --> 35:05.789
( phone ringing )

35:09.349 --> 35:10.869
Grand Central Station.

35:10.909 --> 35:13.629
Hello?

35:15.269 --> 35:16.909
Okay.

35:18.389 --> 35:19.869
Thank you.

35:24.109 --> 35:26.429
Wait till Julie
hears this.

35:29.509 --> 35:31.909
Hey, sweetie.

35:31.989 --> 35:33.949
Uh, I'm still learning
how to do the wash,

35:33.989 --> 35:35.429
so whatever no longer fits,

35:35.469 --> 35:37.109
we'll just send it
to your sister.

35:37.189 --> 35:38.309
I know what you did.

35:38.349 --> 35:40.869
What do you mean?

35:43.829 --> 35:46.229
What's this?

35:46.309 --> 35:47.709
A copy of Trey's confession.

35:47.749 --> 35:49.149
Saying that if I
didn't shoot him,

35:49.189 --> 35:50.509
he would have
killed his brother.

35:50.589 --> 35:52.189
The police have one, too.

36:01.549 --> 36:03.389
Do you know what you've done?

36:05.069 --> 36:06.269
I'm not going to jail.

36:06.349 --> 36:07.989
But where are you going to go,
Marissa, huh?

36:08.069 --> 36:09.429
You know how small
this town is.

36:09.509 --> 36:10.629
This will get out.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.349
What, that I saved
my boyfriend's life?

36:13.389 --> 36:14.709
That you shot someone.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.149
When there's a scandal,
no one cares about the details.

36:19.229 --> 36:21.069
All you care about

36:21.109 --> 36:22.669
is what people in Newport
think of us--

36:22.749 --> 36:24.149
of you.

36:24.229 --> 36:26.589
You know, I don't need you
to protect me.

36:26.669 --> 36:28.949
I need you
to stay out of my life.

36:49.589 --> 36:51.029
What happened?

36:51.069 --> 36:52.629
You have a hell of a girlfriend.

36:52.709 --> 36:54.029
And if you two
get married,

36:54.069 --> 36:55.789
you'll have a hell
of a mother-in-law,

36:55.829 --> 36:57.469
but you're free.

37:01.029 --> 37:02.949
There's something I got to do.

39:31.589 --> 39:33.109
Thanks.

39:41.189 --> 39:43.229
( sighing )

39:48.349 --> 39:49.349
Are you okay?

39:49.429 --> 39:51.949
Yeah.

39:52.029 --> 39:53.389
Yeah.

39:55.629 --> 39:58.149
This one time
when we were kids,

39:58.189 --> 40:00.589
Trey got in this big
fight with my mom

40:00.629 --> 40:05.549
and her boyfriend
of the day, and...

40:05.629 --> 40:06.829
he ran away.

40:06.869 --> 40:12.029
And I stayed up all
night waiting for him,

40:12.109 --> 40:14.189
wondering where he went.

40:16.509 --> 40:19.669
It was always me and Trey
against the world.

40:19.749 --> 40:22.549
How would I make
it without him?

40:26.589 --> 40:33.549
Now here I am
again... alone,

40:33.589 --> 40:35.029
wondering where he went.

40:35.069 --> 40:37.829
Hey, look,
you're not alone this time.

40:37.909 --> 40:40.989
I know, I know.

40:41.069 --> 40:43.869
I really want
to put this behind us.

40:43.949 --> 40:46.869
So do I, but...

40:46.949 --> 40:48.949
I mean, can we?

40:49.029 --> 40:51.069
I hope so.

40:54.349 --> 40:55.429
Okay.

40:55.509 --> 40:57.469
Okay.

40:58.389 --> 41:06.069
