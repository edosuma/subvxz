WEBVTT

00:12.840 --> 00:16.720
and said he was doing security checks
on vulnerable people like myself.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.120
And did you ask for ID?

00:19.200 --> 00:22.560
No! Well, he was in uniform.
Helmet and everything.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.720
-Oh, am I stupid?
-No, no, not at all.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.000
Then he came in,
and I made him a cup of tea.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.880
And he was asking about burglar alarms,
but I said I didn't have one.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.360
Locks on doors.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.560
He was very convincing,
and he really knew his stuff.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.760
Then he asked me
where I kept my jewelry and valuables.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.720
I said I didn't really have
anything of value,

00:44.800 --> 00:48.120
but I had been saving up
out of my pension for a couple of years,

00:48.200 --> 00:50.720
and I had about £500
in the biscuit barrel.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.040
And he asked me to show him, so I did.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.360
And he said, "That's good.
They probably wouldn't look in there."

00:58.320 --> 00:59.840
We went back in the living room,

00:59.920 --> 01:03.520
and he asked to use the toilet,
and he must have come in here and--

01:05.280 --> 01:08.240
-Yeah. And, uh, are you insured?
-No.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.320
I won't get it back
even if they catch him.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.200
He's probably spent it on drugs.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.680
Probably.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.960
Um, you reported it to the police though?

01:16.040 --> 01:19.080
Yes, and they confirmed
he wasn't a real policeman,

01:19.160 --> 01:21.080
because they said there is no officer

01:21.160 --> 01:23.800
with a "Made in Britain" tattoo
across his forehead.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.880
-A "Made in Britain" tattoo on his head?
-Yes.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.440
-Take a picture.
-Yeah.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.680
Oh, I'm so stupid.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.840
You're not stupid.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.560
-The world's a fucked-up place.
-Smile.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.480
Life really is unfair, isn't it?

01:42.000 --> 01:46.480
Old people shouldn't feel ashamed
'cause they get conned by fucking scum.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.040
I'll pop in here and get summat.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.840
-See you later.
-See you later.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.440
Brought your chess set, Dad.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.760
-Oh, you remembered!
-One of us has got to.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.320
-Got to what?
-Remember.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.720
Remember what?

02:20.400 --> 02:21.400
Fucking hell.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.520
-You all right?
-Yeah.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.600
My birthday today.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.800
-Is it?
-Mm-hmm.

02:27.880 --> 02:28.720
You didn't warn me.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.720
-It's no big deal.
-Do you want to go for a drink later?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.200
You don't have to.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.840
What, are you my sponsor?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.840
Okay. Well, if you're not busy.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.840
Never busy. Look.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.040
-No segregation on this board.
-Shh!

02:45.120 --> 02:47.520
-Oh.
-Please. I'm trying to concentrate.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.400
Oh. Um--

02:50.480 --> 02:52.000
No. There's someone there.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.400
Oh, doesn't--

02:54.320 --> 02:56.320
-That better? That please you?
-Yeah.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.880
Off you go!

02:59.640 --> 03:01.560
Your move!

03:01.640 --> 03:04.520
Well, I'll probably start with this one.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.240
-Aw.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.520
That is just ridiculous.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.520
-Here's some water.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.160
All right. Come on in.
Oi, shush, all of ya!

03:14.240 --> 03:15.520
Right, we're all here.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.520
Tambury Fair, the big one.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.040
I'll be emceeing the whole event.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.520
I've got me costume and everything.
Leather pants and a whip.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.920
-What are you going as?
-Slave trader.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.160
It was quite big round here
back in the day.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.040
Now, we got one of them things
with a target.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.840
And you hit it with a ball,
and then it dunks a witch in the water.

03:33.920 --> 03:38.160
-June's gonna be our witch, aren't you?
-Yeah. Love witches. Hmm.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.040
Now, we need a volunteer
to stand in the stocks,

03:41.120 --> 03:44.680
and you get pelted with tomatoes
and rotten eggs and stuff like that.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.760
-James.
-No. I'm not doing it.

03:47.840 --> 03:48.880
It's for charity.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.600
Yeah, but anyone can do that.
I'm a skilled performer.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.560
Oh bless.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.640
Right, skilled performer,
what are you gonna be, then?

03:56.720 --> 03:59.760
It's gotta be something classic
from hundreds of years ago.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.120
Uh--

04:02.960 --> 04:04.520
-What about a hillock?
-Perfect.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.880
What's a hillock?

04:06.800 --> 04:09.400
It's like an old-fashioned thing,
isn't it? I don't know.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.680
-Like a little hill.
-How can I be a hill?

04:12.680 --> 04:16.000
Well, we lay you down,
we cover you in mud and turf--

04:16.080 --> 04:17.520
Put some little flowers on.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.200
Put some little lovely flowers
around you. It'll look lovely.

04:20.280 --> 04:22.640
And then people will go by and go,
"Oh, look, it's a hillock!"

04:22.720 --> 04:24.480
I'm not gonna be a fucking hillock!

04:25.080 --> 04:25.920
Language!

04:26.000 --> 04:28.680
No. No, no, I can't believe
that's your idea for me!

04:29.640 --> 04:30.920
You're supposed to be my agent.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.240
I know you can't get me real work. I mean,
that's obviously out of the question.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.800
But to suggest
that you cover me in mud in public?

04:38.680 --> 04:39.600
Unbelievable.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.840
Sorry you had to hear that, everyone.
He's like a wild bull at the minute.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.400
-He's-- He's constipated.
-No excuse!

04:49.960 --> 04:52.120
And you're wrong, actually, James.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.320
Because I have found work for you.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.560
-I was gonna tell you about it later.
-Right. What?

05:00.880 --> 05:03.440
Have you seen a show
called <i>The Undatables</i>?

05:03.520 --> 05:05.040
No. What is it?

05:05.120 --> 05:08.320
Well, people go on dates, and they see
if they get along. It's lovely.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.120
A reality show?

05:10.720 --> 05:12.400
Yes, but it's brilliant!

05:12.480 --> 05:14.240
It's not a professional acting job, is it?

05:14.320 --> 05:16.240
Ah, well, that's the clever bit, right?

05:16.320 --> 05:18.960
'Cause it's for people
who can't normally get dates,

05:19.040 --> 05:21.560
you know, because they're disabled
or disfigured or something.

05:21.640 --> 05:25.640
-So how does that apply to me?
-Well, I told them about your shape.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.000
-Of course.
-But that wasn't enough.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.040
So I said…

05:32.840 --> 05:34.320
"He's mentally retarded."

05:34.400 --> 05:35.440
Fucking hell!

05:35.520 --> 05:36.600
What?!

05:36.680 --> 05:38.960
I'm not going on
a fucking reality dating show,

05:39.040 --> 05:42.240
pretending to be mentally disabled,
just 'cause you can't get me any work.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.400
I cannot win, can I? It is work.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.160
It is not work!

05:47.240 --> 05:49.080
It's pretending to be disabled.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.440
Acting is pretending!

05:50.520 --> 05:52.800
What did you even say was wrong with me?
Huh?

05:52.880 --> 05:56.760
Well, I didn't go into specifics, did I?
This is every actor's dream!

05:56.840 --> 06:00.200
Look at Daniel Day-Lewis in <i>My Left Foot</i>.
Fuck me, what was up with him?

06:00.280 --> 06:02.320
-Dunno.
-No one cared.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.040
<i>Rain Man</i>. What was that little twat doing?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.560
It's not hard!

06:07.160 --> 06:08.680
-Forget it.
-You're an actor!

06:08.760 --> 06:11.560
Forget it. It's offensive.
You're offensive.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.240
I'll do it.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.360
It wouldn't be the same with you, Brian.
You actually are a bit mental.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.280
Fair point.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.360
Uh, I've got a package for Kath.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.520
-Yeah, I'll sign for it.
-I'll sign for it if you want.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.560
-It's all right. I've got it.
-I'm Kath.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.800
You ride a motorbike?

06:38.640 --> 06:40.200
No, I just get very nervous on the bus.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.480
Oh.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.000
-Very funny.
-I ride a Honda.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.400
All right. Sweet, man.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.320
-You a journalist?
-For my sins.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.040
What does that mean?

06:55.560 --> 06:56.400
Nothing.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.040
Yeah, journalist.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.680
Well, I sell adverts
that go next to the journalism.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.040
Yeah, it's long hours,

07:03.120 --> 07:05.160
you know, but it's very rewarding.

07:06.240 --> 07:10.160
And, uh, I don't mind burning
the midnight oil 'cause I'm single.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.880
Young, free, and single.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.160
-Do you want to go for a drink sometime?
-Yes, please.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.120
Hiya!

07:24.640 --> 07:26.120
-All right?
-Hiya.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.760
-Brought you some cake, darling.
-Ooh, thank you.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.960
-Bang goes the diet.
-Yeah.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.000
Won't be able to get in your wedding suit.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.200
I'll be all right. Making me own dress,
so I'll make it a bit bigger.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.760
Oh, making your own wedding dress?

07:37.840 --> 07:40.680
-Yeah, saving money, in't it?
-That's so sad.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.240
Why?

07:42.320 --> 07:45.200
Well, not having enough money
for the most important day of your life.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.040
I have got enough money,
which is hardly any.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.640
You don't need money if you've got love.
It's just a dress.

07:52.160 --> 07:55.640
-I haven't got money or love.
-Oh, everyone loves you, darling.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.200
What about me?

07:57.280 --> 07:58.800
Well, there's someone for everyone.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.120
Had a date with a teacher
who thought I was thick.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.040
Patronizing me about poetry,
slagging off Kipling.

08:04.120 --> 08:07.040
I love his cakes.
Have to have them at the wedding.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.800
If it makes you feel any better, maybe
he just pretended to think you were thick

08:10.880 --> 08:12.160
'cause he didn't fancy you.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.840
-You'd know if he liked ya.
-How?

08:14.920 --> 08:18.520
You can feel it. He's not just polite.
He's considerate and caring.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.680
Shows an interest,
not just a courtesy either.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.160
There's a warmth that he can't help.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.920
Smiles when he looks at ya,
touches his hair.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.920
Picks something up for you,
not just say you've dropped it.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.120
Wants your hands to be close.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.080
So next date,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.640
see if he smiles, touches his hair,
and picks up any chips you drop.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.160
Lenny told me
about the life insurance money.

08:42.840 --> 08:43.680
Right.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.720
He hasn't cashed it. He don't want it
under these circumstances.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.760
Oh my God, that's so romantic.

08:48.840 --> 08:53.560
Well, it is, but the money's
not symbolic of Lisa, darling.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.600
Money's just spending tokens.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.600
Lisa was a beautiful person
who you spent your life with.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.400
She lives in your heart.

09:01.920 --> 09:05.840
She only took out the life insurance
so you didn't have to worry about stuff.

09:06.560 --> 09:10.440
Take it from the insurance company
at least. Enjoy it.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.520
Blow it at a casino if you have to.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.880
But if you don't spend it,

09:18.960 --> 09:20.440
Lisa wasted her time.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.920
<i>I want you to live, Tony.</i>

09:33.680 --> 09:36.880
Not just not kill yourself
or wait patiently for death,

09:38.320 --> 09:39.160
but live.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.960
Live your life as if there's no tomorrow

09:42.480 --> 09:45.400
and then you wake up and there is
a tomorrow and you do it again.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.360
Hmm.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.840
It doesn't matter what you do
so long as you live your life to the full

09:50.920 --> 09:53.280
and enjoy every second of it.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.560
And if you don't think it's worth trying,
why should I?

10:00.560 --> 10:03.200
I used to sit on this bench every day,

10:04.200 --> 10:05.200
by myself,

10:05.880 --> 10:09.080
hoping that someone would come along
who would understand.

10:10.880 --> 10:11.840
And it was you.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.280
You were in the same boat as me.
You'd lost someone.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.240
Well, it's a graveyard,
so the chances are--

10:24.560 --> 10:27.120
You see, you still think and listen
and make people laugh,

10:27.200 --> 10:30.240
make them feel they're worth something,
worth listening to.

10:31.040 --> 10:35.280
I just want you to find something that
makes you want to get up in the morning.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.480
I'm still going.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.600
I know I'll never replace Stan,
but I'm not gonna throw in the towel,

10:41.680 --> 10:46.240
and the only thing that's worrying me now
is you not being happy.

10:47.720 --> 10:48.960
It's all about hope.

10:49.880 --> 10:50.760
Hmm.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
You're allowed to

10:53.960 --> 10:57.160
miss Lisa and grieve and feel angry.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.000
But I can't bear
the thought of you having no hope.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.080
That's the saddest thing
in the world to me.

11:11.000 --> 11:11.840
Giving in.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.640
Please,

11:17.600 --> 11:18.920
tell me you have hope.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.000
I do.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.040
But

11:25.720 --> 11:28.040
I'll never find anyone to replace Lisa.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.840
And I've realized I--

11:31.480 --> 11:32.440
I don't want to.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.880
But I do wanna find a reason to live.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.400
That's not out of the question.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.040
Blimey, you work fast, don't you?

11:53.120 --> 11:54.160
What do you mean?

11:54.240 --> 11:57.080
Well, you know, just met and you're like,
"Wanna go for a drink?"

11:59.600 --> 12:01.480
I thought
that's what you wanted me to say.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.480
Right.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.640
Oh, whoops.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.720
Have you got Parkinson's?

12:26.280 --> 12:27.120
No.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.320
-Emma?
-Yes?

12:43.120 --> 12:44.360
It's Jack.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.240
Jack-- Jack! Oh my God!

12:47.320 --> 12:51.120
-I'm so sorry. It's been so long.
-Yeah.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.920
Well, 30 years. Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.120
I mean, look. I used to have hair.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.160
-You did!
-Yeah.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.480
So how are you?

12:59.560 --> 13:01.560
Yeah, you know.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.560
Yeah. Yeah.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.120
-You married? You got kids or anything?
-No, nope, none of that.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.760
You? Are you--

13:07.840 --> 13:12.120
Me? No, no, I'm divorced. No kids.
So, um, complete loser.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.280
-Oh. Pfft.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.840
And what do you do now?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.720
I'm a nurse in a care home.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.880
Oh.

13:18.960 --> 13:19.800
Yeah, perfect.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.160
You?

13:21.240 --> 13:22.440
Uh, I import wine.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.400
Oh, perfect.

13:25.920 --> 13:26.840
We should hook up.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.520
-Uh--
-Oh, don't worry.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.000
I shall give you my number.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.920
-There you go. That's me.
-Cheers.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.520
-It was so lovely to see you again.
-You too.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.520
All right.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.400
You can't have beer before playing squash.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.800
Course you can. Go on.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.880
-You're bringing it with you?
-Yeah, in case I get thirsty.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.800
Unbelievable.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.800
-Oh my-- Hello.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.400
-Hiya.
-That stinks. Oh my God.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.320
Right.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.400
Oh.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.240
Ah.

14:11.840 --> 14:12.960
-Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.520
-Love all.
-Tits!

14:15.600 --> 14:16.480
Okay, let.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.680
-Oh, is that--
-Let.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.640
You can't shout "tits" before a serve.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.480
-What if I've got Tourette's?
-You--

14:23.760 --> 14:24.840
It'd explain a lot actually.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.520
Oh, come off it.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.160
-Oh.
-Come on!

14:36.520 --> 14:38.000
How are you doing this?

14:40.040 --> 14:41.800
You didn't even run for that.
You knackered?

14:41.880 --> 14:43.040
I had to go round you.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.640
-Right.
-Long journey.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.160
No! How are you--

14:46.240 --> 14:47.960
-Oh my--
-Unlucky!

14:48.040 --> 14:49.640
Oh no!

14:49.720 --> 14:51.200
Go on! Run!

14:51.280 --> 14:53.160
Unlucky!

14:54.680 --> 14:57.600
-Oh, will you just--
-Unlucky!

14:57.680 --> 15:00.120
-Unlucky!

15:01.080 --> 15:03.360
Ooh!

15:03.440 --> 15:05.840
-Will you stop shouting, please?
-Unlucky.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.960
It's like playing with a wild pig.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.600
-Why didn't you go for it?
-I didn't know where it was going.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.880
All right, I'll tell you
where I'm gonna put it.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.920
It's down there! It's over there!

15:19.000 --> 15:20.040
Over there!

15:20.600 --> 15:21.920
Unlucky!

15:22.000 --> 15:23.080
Watch the wall.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.640
Go on, over there!

15:24.720 --> 15:26.760
-Is that helping or not?
-No, it's not helping.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.520
-Okay.
-Assume nothing is helping.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.640
-Okay. Okay.
-Just be quiet.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.560
Ah.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.920
This is ridiculous.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.200
-Yeah, all right.
-It's fizzy, innit?

15:38.280 --> 15:39.120
Is it?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.120
-Oh my God.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.880
-Oh, fuck.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.480
-I feel sick.
-Absolutely gross.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.600
-Oh my God. Come on.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.400
Oh my God!

15:51.840 --> 15:53.120
Ah.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.880
-I mean, that's disgusting.
-What?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.160
What?

15:56.240 --> 15:57.080
What you--

15:57.600 --> 15:59.000
Don't slip on it.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.120
What are you saying?
It's in the middle of the court!

16:01.200 --> 16:02.960
How am I not gonna
fucking slip on it, Tony?

16:03.480 --> 16:04.320
Honestly, it's--

16:05.360 --> 16:07.400
It's-- Ugh. Ah.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.520
-What's the matter?
-Ah.

16:10.920 --> 16:11.760
Just breathe.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.160
Oh no.

16:16.080 --> 16:16.920
Oh no.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.400
Oh no.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.240
Go on.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.840
What?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.240
Laugh.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.240
Why would I laugh?

16:31.760 --> 16:34.840
It's nothing. It was just
a little warning. I'm fine.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.760
-How have I got a weaker heart than you?
-It's classic.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.320
-You're all pent up.
-I'm all pent up?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.240
You're like a ball of fury all the time!

16:43.320 --> 16:45.800
Calm down. Breathe.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.520
Yeah. Very funny.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.520
You've got all the same stress
and anger as me,

16:51.600 --> 16:54.480
but I shout at people
and call them cunts and smash things up.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.680
You keep it all in.
It's gotta go somewhere.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.240
It's not fair.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.080
No. Life's not fair.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.120
And then you die.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.120
I don't smoke. I watch what I eat.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.760
I do yoga, Pilates, stretching.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.840
-I hardly ever drink booze.
-Exactly.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.880
And this is a punishment for all that.

17:19.080 --> 17:23.760
Seriously, though, you don't have to have
the weight of the world on your shoulders,

17:23.840 --> 17:26.720
always trying to please people.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.280
You know, they'll be fine
if you tell 'em to fuck off now and again.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.200
You worry about everything.

17:33.240 --> 17:36.800
At work, at home, social occasions.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.680
You worry about me.

17:39.400 --> 17:44.000
All this was to help me,
and look where it got ya.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.080
I know I stole
all the sympathy for Lisa dying.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.160
She was your big sister.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.480
And I think you couldn't afford
to have your breakdown because of me.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.720
You couldn't grieve because
you were worried about what I'd do next.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.640
So…

18:05.040 --> 18:06.160
thanks for that.

18:06.840 --> 18:07.680
Oh.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.600
And you're such a feeble
little fucking pussy at sport.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.000
There we go. Good.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.920
Well, thanks for your kind words, Tony.
I think I counted about three in there.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.160
I'm just glad
we're only related by marriage

18:21.240 --> 18:22.560
because I'd be embarrassed

18:22.640 --> 18:26.680
to share actual genetic material
with such a mutant weakling.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.080
Yeah, lovely, this is helping.

18:28.160 --> 18:32.640
We've got to build you up, do you know
what I mean? But slowly and carefully.

18:32.720 --> 18:37.920
Squash is way too dangerous for someone
that modern medicine refers to as "puny."

18:39.440 --> 18:41.840
Let's start on something
like flower arranging

18:41.920 --> 18:43.880
and work our way up to hopscotch.

18:43.960 --> 18:48.200
-Will you keep the dress afterwards?
-It's not a dress. It's a gown.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.600
A gown is a dress.
It's a little lady's dress.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.920
They put you in something
they thought you'd like to wear.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.360
-Want me to have another heart attack?
-No, they weren't sure.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.800
If you keep doing this, it will be murder.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.240
They said, "It's a lady, isn't it?
Check the genitals." Still no clue.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.720
Put it in a dress.
Did they give you a smear test?

19:03.800 --> 19:06.080
They might as well while they're here.

19:06.160 --> 19:10.280
-They need to test everything because--
-Can you-- I've just had a heart attack!

19:10.360 --> 19:12.600
-Stop making me stressed!
-Calm down.

19:12.680 --> 19:16.160
Calm down? If I have another one,
it'll be your fault.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.160
How dare you, madam?

19:18.080 --> 19:21.080
-Have you not got somewhere else to be?
-I have, actually.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.640
-Great.
-I'm going out for a drink.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.600
I can still do that.
I've got a good heart. I can enjoy myself.

19:26.680 --> 19:27.920
Okay. See you tomorrow.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.480
-Hopefully not.
-Wow. Don't say that.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.160
See you later.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.120
You look down, boy.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.600
Yeah.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.400
Need some advice
from a dude who's been there, done that?

19:55.840 --> 20:00.200
I'm not gonna make it in showbiz.
It just doesn't happen to people like me.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.720
-Fat people?
-No!

20:02.560 --> 20:05.240
I mean ordinary people
who live in small towns

20:05.320 --> 20:07.960
with the worst agent in the world
whose idea of a big break

20:08.040 --> 20:10.440
is pretending to be disabled
on a reality show.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.520
I think you might be right, mate.

20:13.040 --> 20:13.960
That's a first.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.600
-Wish I was wrong in this case.
-Ah, spot on, son.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.120
Who cares anyway?

20:20.680 --> 20:21.760
Huh?

20:21.840 --> 20:23.600
Got everything you need right here.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.560
Tambury's a lovely town.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.400
Hmm?

20:27.480 --> 20:28.840
Easy job. Nice mum.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.080
-Great friend. You.
-Back at you, boy.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.240
Come on. Come on.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.360
Why do you wanna be a fake wannabe anyway?

20:39.320 --> 20:40.160
Huh?

20:41.360 --> 20:42.920
Showbiz-shmobiz, isn't it?

20:44.320 --> 20:45.520
All bloody pedos anyway.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.240
I know the score, mate.

20:49.920 --> 20:54.400
You thought if you were famous,
people would respect you more.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.160
I guess you're right.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.440
Works for some,
but when you're a proper loser like us,

21:01.480 --> 21:03.600
soon comes out and you're even worse off.

21:04.120 --> 21:07.920
Because at the moment, you're a loser,
but the world doesn't know about it.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.480
-Good point.
-Hmm.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.400
You don't need the adoration of strangers.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.360
You've got people who like you
for who you really are.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.200
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

21:19.440 --> 21:22.560
Mum says you can't expect other people
to love you until you love yourself.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.480
Hmm.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.160
-Wise woman, your mum.
-She is.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.560
If it wasn't for Lenny,

21:35.640 --> 21:38.760
I'd hit her little ass
like a ginger stepchild.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.440
Huh.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.560
Hey?

21:44.920 --> 21:46.840
-Cheers, mate.
-Yeah. Love you loads.

21:47.360 --> 21:48.640
-And you.
-Yeah.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.680
Oh, fucking hell.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.520
-What?
-This is depressing, innit?

22:05.720 --> 22:06.600
None taken.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.520
Do you know I work
with lonely, old people every day,

22:10.600 --> 22:13.560
and I think I could quite honestly say

22:13.640 --> 22:16.360
that-- they're probably happier than I am.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.760
-No! Sorry, did that sound a bit pathetic?

22:18.840 --> 22:20.480
No. It's funny.

22:20.560 --> 22:23.800
I'm always the one who does the overtime,
who covers for everybody's holidays

22:23.880 --> 22:27.120
because I figure
that it's less depressing than actually

22:27.840 --> 22:29.280
being at home by myself.

22:29.360 --> 22:33.000
And then you came in
like a little breath of fresh air.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.720
Sorry. Um--

22:36.520 --> 22:38.400
Listen,
I know you're still in love with Lisa.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.080
I know you are,
and I know you always will be.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.840
And I think that's why I'm able
to just sort of sit here and just--

22:46.720 --> 22:48.560
Like, pour my heart out,

22:48.640 --> 22:51.000
you know,
without any weird complications or--

22:51.080 --> 22:52.240
-Definitely.
-Yeah.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.880
-I just think I sort of wasted my life.
-You haven't.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.280
And I know that's not a reason
for you to care.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.360
I do care.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.320
No, I know you care,
but not, you know, <i>care</i>.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.520
I just think that it's not a reason
for you to be with me.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.080
No, I know.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.520
But I do care about you.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.720
And I want you to be happy.

23:21.520 --> 23:26.600
Well, I actually bumped into an old flame
earlier today, so…

23:29.000 --> 23:29.880
Who's that?

23:29.960 --> 23:34.400
Uh, it was someone I went to college with.
A long time ago, obviously.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.240
He went off, did his thing,
and I stayed here and did my thing.

23:39.800 --> 23:40.840
Hmm.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.760
Anyway, uh,

23:42.840 --> 23:45.480
he said that we should hook up.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.440
So, hmm.

23:49.800 --> 23:50.880
You should.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.560
Yeah? Should I?

23:54.800 --> 23:55.720
Definitely.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.000
I want you to be happy.

24:02.680 --> 24:03.560
Like I was.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.760
Just glad you're better.

24:10.960 --> 24:11.960
I know, and…

24:14.600 --> 24:15.560
Happy birthday!

24:15.640 --> 24:16.640
Thank you.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.400
-Cheers.
-Hey!

24:20.480 --> 24:22.360
-Hey!

24:22.440 --> 24:24.080
-Oh fuck.
-It's kicking off now, innit?

24:32.680 --> 24:33.600
Good girl.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.200
Hello.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.160
Come on!

25:39.240 --> 25:40.160
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:40.240 --> 25:42.760
<i>-Oh, don't disturb her.</i>
-<i>I won't.</i>
