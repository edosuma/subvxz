13:58.375 --> 14:00.458
- I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

14:00.458 --> 14:02.291
- MR. MORRIS.

14:02.291 --> 14:03.500
- YES.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.000
I'M JESSICA MORRIS' FATHER.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.291
THANK YOU FOR SEEING ME.

14:07.291 --> 14:10.166
- I AM SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.542
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

14:11.542 --> 14:13.959
- I'D LIKE YOU
TO REOPEN JESSICA'S CASE.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.834
- MR. MORRIS, I KNOW
THIS MUST BE VERY DIFFICULT,

14:17.834 --> 14:19.792
BUT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER RULED
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER'S DEATH

14:19.792 --> 14:21.333
WAS AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE,

14:21.333 --> 14:23.000
NOT A HOMICIDE.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.333
- YES, I KNOW.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.792
BUT HER STERNUM WAS CRACKED.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.834
AND PARAMEDICS SAID
THEY NEVER PERFORMED CPR

14:28.834 --> 14:31.417
BECAUSE SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD
WHEN THEY ARRIVED.

14:31.417 --> 14:32.834
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

14:32.834 --> 14:33.959
- DOES IT MATTER?

14:33.959 --> 14:35.792
IF SOMEONE WAS WITH HER
WHEN SHE DIED,

14:35.792 --> 14:36.917
WHY AREN'T YOU LOOKING
INTO THAT?

14:36.917 --> 14:39.041
- I'M SORRY,
BUT THE CASE IS CLOSED.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.875
- WELL, THEN REOPEN IT.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.917
WHAT IF THAT PERSON KILLED HER
AND THEN TRIED TO COVER IT UP?

14:42.917 --> 14:44.709
- I AM SORRY,
BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.000
- PLEASE, JUST LISTEN.

14:48.875 --> 14:51.083
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU HAVE KIDS,

14:51.083 --> 14:52.750
BUT I HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE
TO SEE 'EM

14:52.750 --> 14:56.291
TURNING TRICKS
ON COLLINS AVENUE.

14:56.291 --> 14:59.000
- I WILL RUN IT UPSTAIRS.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.667
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.417
- HOW IS YOUR MAGIC WORKING?

15:05.417 --> 15:06.834
- THIS IS A TOUGH NUT,

15:06.834 --> 15:08.542
BUT I WANT TO PROVE
SERGEANT BATISTA WRONG.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.041
I CAN DO THIS.
I CAN DO THIS.

15:10.041 --> 15:11.917
- WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM WITH YOU?

15:11.917 --> 15:14.041
- HE DOESN'T THINK I'M GOOD
ENOUGH TO DATE HIS SISTER,

15:14.041 --> 15:16.208
SO I BACKED OFF.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.417
- OKAY.
STOP WITH THE FINGERS.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.250
WE GOTTA TALK.

15:24.333 --> 15:28.583
LOOK, I--I UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE
COWARDLY GEEK RESPONSE.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.083
- I'M NOT A GEEK.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.583
- ONE BRIDGE AT A TIME,
LOUIS.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.458
YOU'RE INTO JAMIE, RIGHT?

15:33.458 --> 15:34.959
- WELL, YEAH,
SHE'S AMAZING.

15:34.959 --> 15:37.625
- WELL, YOU HAVE
TO TELL HER THAT.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.792
WHEN IT COMES
TO MATTERS OF THE HEART,

15:39.792 --> 15:42.458
ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR DICK.

15:44.625 --> 15:47.417
- YEAH, BUT HOW AM I
EVER GONNA WIN OVER BATISTA?

15:47.417 --> 15:49.000
- YOU DON'T.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.917
IF JAMIE'S INTO YOU
AS MUCH AS YOU'RE INTO HER,

15:51.917 --> 15:55.500
SHE'S GONNA TAKE CARE
OF BATISTA FOR YOU.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.583
JUST DON'T TELL HIM
I TOLD YOU SO.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.250
- [stoner voice] YEAH, I WANTED
TO TALK TO DR. CASEY

15:59.250 --> 16:02.625
ABOUT THIS "D" HE GAVE ME.

16:02.625 --> 16:06.750
WHEN'S HIS CLASS AGAIN?

16:06.750 --> 16:09.125
BRUNNER HALL OF SCIENCE.

16:09.125 --> 16:12.083
GOT IT.
I'LL CATCH HIM AFTER CLASS.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.333
I BROUGHT YOU A SANDWICH.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.291
- DID YOU FIND GELLAR?

16:25.291 --> 16:26.917
- NO.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.917
BUT HE UPDATED HIS BLOG.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.959
- HE DID?

16:38.125 --> 16:40.417
[typing]

16:42.166 --> 16:45.083
- YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS MEANS?

16:45.083 --> 16:49.500
- "ALL THOSE FOLLOWING
FALSE PROPHETS ARE DOOMED."

16:49.500 --> 16:51.834
IT'S A MESSAGE FOR ME.

16:51.834 --> 16:55.333
HE'S OFFERING ME
A WAY BACK IN.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.667
- AND I'M THE FALSE PROPHET.

17:00.583 --> 17:03.000
EVER HEARD OF THIS GUY?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.792
TRENT CASEY?

17:04.792 --> 17:07.000
- YES.
GELLAR HATES HIM.

17:07.000 --> 17:07.959
HE'S AN ATHEIST.

17:07.959 --> 17:09.166
- DOES HE HATE HIM ENOUGH

17:09.166 --> 17:11.667
TO WANT TO KILL HIM?

17:11.667 --> 17:14.959
THE PAINTING OF THE BOWLS
OF WRATH IN THE CHURCH

17:14.959 --> 17:18.125
HAD "2LOT" WRITTEN ON IT.

17:18.125 --> 17:19.709
- YOU THINK
HE'S THE NEXT VICTIM.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.375
- YES.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.583
- [breathes deeply]

17:24.583 --> 17:26.000
HOW DO WE FIND HIM?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.875
- I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

17:29.875 --> 17:30.959
- OH, MAN!

17:30.959 --> 17:32.375
- ALL RIGHT,
BOYS AND GIRLS,

17:32.375 --> 17:34.083
TIME FOR A SNACK.
- I WANT ONE.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.542
- GOOD JOB.
TIME FOR SNACK.

17:36.542 --> 17:40.208
- IS THIS YOUR PENANCE TOO?
- WHAT?

17:40.208 --> 17:43.208
- CATERING
FOR THE TODDLER HORDE.

17:43.208 --> 17:45.083
MY WIFE'S IN A MEETING.

17:45.083 --> 17:47.041
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

17:47.041 --> 17:49.125
- I'M HERE FOR MY SON.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.250
- HARRISON.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.417
- COOKIE.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.208
- THANK YOU, HARRISON.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.834
[laughter]

18:01.709 --> 18:05.625
- THAT'S ONE'S MINE.

18:05.625 --> 18:08.458
[music playing]

18:12.250 --> 18:14.542
- HEY.

18:14.542 --> 18:15.500
HOW ARE YOU?

18:15.500 --> 18:17.959
- UH, OKAY.

18:17.959 --> 18:19.083
HOW ARE YOU?

18:19.083 --> 18:22.083
- UH...
THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.750
BUT I THINK I LEFT SOMETHING
IN YOUR CAR.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.542
- SORRY.
I DON'T HAVE A CAR.

18:27.542 --> 18:30.750
- UHH, DIDN'T I MEET YOU
LAST NIGHT

18:30.750 --> 18:31.917
OUT AT VIRGINIA GARDENS?

18:31.917 --> 18:35.291
- OH, YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR MY MOM.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.583
- MOM.

18:39.583 --> 18:41.917
- HOTNESS LIKE THAT'S
GOT TO RUN IN THE FAMILY, RIGHT?

18:41.917 --> 18:44.583
I MEAN, SHE MUST BE LIKE...

18:44.583 --> 18:46.166
HOLY SHIT.
HI.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.291
WE GOT THE WRONG HOUSE.
- JOEY.

18:47.291 --> 18:49.709
- HEY.
- OKAY.

18:49.709 --> 18:53.625
- SO YOU TWO MET
AT THE CLUB?

18:53.625 --> 18:55.125
- OH, NO, NO.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.750
WE MET ACROSS THE STREET
AT THE WAFFLE HOUSE.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.041
I WORK THE LATE SHIFT,

18:58.041 --> 19:00.375
AND THIS ONE WAS ALL HANDS.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.125
- MM.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.792
I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE,

19:03.792 --> 19:06.458
BUT JOEY AND I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE STATION.

19:06.458 --> 19:10.458
AND WE THINK HE MAY HAVE LEFT
SOME THINGS IN YOUR CAR.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.834
- IT WASN'T HIS INNOCENCE,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

19:12.834 --> 19:14.583
- [nervous laughter]

19:14.583 --> 19:15.625
[chuckles]

19:15.625 --> 19:17.792
- IT'S UNLOCKED.

19:17.792 --> 19:22.875
- THANK YOU, MA'AM.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.458
- YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT THIS.

19:24.458 --> 19:26.458
- I CAN SAY ANYTHING I WANT.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.625
- GOT IT.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.583
OH, MY GOD.
WE TOOK PICTURES.

19:33.583 --> 19:34.834
- [chuckles]

19:37.333 --> 19:40.000
- I HOPE YOU AT LEAST WORE--

19:40.000 --> 19:42.041
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:42.041 --> 19:43.542
- OH, GREAT.
FUCKING GREAT.

19:43.542 --> 19:46.417
- [groans]

19:46.417 --> 19:47.667
SHIT.

19:47.667 --> 19:48.834
- JUST CALL THE STATION.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.166
HAVE 'EM SEND A TOW.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.125
- THE STATION DOESN'T KNOW
THAT WE'RE DOWN HERE

19:52.125 --> 19:53.458
GETTING YOUR GUN BACK,

19:53.458 --> 19:55.417
AND WE GOT TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.041
- OR THAT YOU'RE DRIVING
A CAR THE '70s WANTS BACK.

19:57.041 --> 19:58.291
- STOW IT, WILL YOU?
I WOULDN'T HAVE

19:58.291 --> 19:59.542
TO BE RACING BACK
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU.

19:59.542 --> 20:00.917
- I COULD HAVE HANDLED THIS
ON MY OWN.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.834
- YOU CAN'T HANDLE
YOUR BALLS RIGHT NOW.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.000
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GROW UP?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.291
- LIKE YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.667
- COME AGAIN?

20:06.667 --> 20:08.125
- ALL YOU WANT TO DO

20:08.125 --> 20:10.125
IS TRY AND CONTROL EVERYTHING

20:10.125 --> 20:11.500
AND EVERYONE AROUND YOU

20:11.500 --> 20:14.041
IN ORDER TO FEEL BETTER
ABOUT YOUR OWN FUCKED-UP LIFE.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.333
- YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.834
- YEAH, REALLY?
'CAUSE YOUR FIRST WIFE

20:17.834 --> 20:19.083
UP AND LEFT YOU.

20:19.083 --> 20:22.250
YOUR SECOND WIFE, SHE WAS
YOUR WIFE FOR, WHAT, SIX MONTHS?

20:22.250 --> 20:24.000
AND YOU GOT A DAUGHTER
THAT WANTS NOTHING

20:24.000 --> 20:24.959
TO DO WITH YOU.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.375
- I THINK YOU NEED TO SHUT UP.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.542
- AND NOW YOUR PANTIES
ARE IN A BIG WET WAD.

20:28.542 --> 20:30.041
WHY?
BECAUSE YOUR LITTLE SISTER'S

20:30.041 --> 20:31.041
DATING SOMEONE
YOU DON'T LIKE.

20:31.041 --> 20:32.375
AM I RIGHT, LIEUTENANT?

20:32.375 --> 20:33.917
OH, WAIT, NO, MY BAD.
I'M SORRY.

20:33.917 --> 20:35.667
YOU'RE STILL SERGEANT,
'CAUSE YOU FUCKED THAT UP TOO.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.375
- [growls]

20:44.208 --> 20:47.125
[grunting]

20:47.125 --> 20:49.250
COME ON, IS THAT ALL YOU GOT,
YOU MOTHERFUCKER?

20:49.250 --> 20:50.583
- LITTLE MOTHERFUCKER.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.875
- HEY!
LEAVE HIM ALONE

20:52.875 --> 20:54.625
OR I'LL CALL THE POLICE.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.709
- [groans]

21:01.250 --> 21:04.417
[bell rings]

21:05.583 --> 21:07.959
- NOW CREATIONISTS SAY

21:07.959 --> 21:10.834
THE SECOND LAW
OF THERMODYNAMICS

21:10.834 --> 21:15.834
DOESN'T ALLOW ORDER
TO ARISE FROM DISORDER.

21:15.834 --> 21:20.166
SO WHY DOES THIS IDEA

21:20.166 --> 21:23.458
MAKE THEIR BIBLE-CLUTCHING
FINGERS TWITCH

21:23.458 --> 21:26.667
WITH EXCITEMENT, HMM?

21:26.667 --> 21:31.417
BECAUSE FOR CREATIONISTS,

21:31.417 --> 21:35.125
IT MEANS THAT THE IDEA
OF EVOLUTION, LIFE ARISING

21:35.125 --> 21:38.583
FROM CHAOS,
CONTRADICTS THE SECOND LAW.

21:38.583 --> 21:39.583
IT CAN'T HAPPEN.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.375
- CAN I LOOK
AT YOUR SYLLABUS?

21:41.375 --> 21:43.333
I FORGOT MINE.

21:43.333 --> 21:47.625
- AND YOU NEED...
[bellowing] GOD...

21:47.625 --> 21:49.125
[laughter]

21:49.125 --> 21:52.125
TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING,
RIGHT?

21:52.125 --> 21:53.417
WRONG.

21:53.417 --> 21:55.750
- HE'S KIND
OF A SELF-IMPORTANT ASSHOLE,

21:55.750 --> 21:58.375
BUT I LIKE HIM.

21:58.375 --> 22:00.959
CASEY'S OFFICE
IS IN SCARNES HALL.

22:00.959 --> 22:03.709
AND HE HAS LATE OFFICE HOURS
TONIGHT.

22:03.709 --> 22:05.458
IN CASE GELLAR DECIDES
TO SHOW UP,

22:05.458 --> 22:06.959
I'LL BE HERE AS WELL.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.709
- THIS COMING FROM PEOPLE
THAT THINK

22:08.709 --> 22:11.166
THERE ARE NO UNICORNS
BECAUSE THEY WERE LATE

22:11.166 --> 22:12.750
GETTING TO NOAH'S ARK.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.125
[laughter]

22:14.125 --> 22:15.792
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY.

22:15.792 --> 22:20.875
READ CHAPTERS NINE
THROUGH TEN FOR NEXT WEEK.

22:20.875 --> 22:22.625
THANK YOU.

22:29.125 --> 22:33.166
- PROFESSOR CASEY.
- MM, YES.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.291
- I BELIEVE
YOU'RE IN DANGER.

22:37.208 --> 22:41.417
- WHAT VARIETY OF LUNATIC
MIGHT YOU BE?

22:41.417 --> 22:43.083
- I'M ONLY TRYING
TO WARN YOU.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.959
- [laughs]
WELL, THEN YOU'RE ONE

22:44.959 --> 22:46.041
OF THE GOOD ONES.

22:46.041 --> 22:47.166
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

22:47.166 --> 22:50.125
HOW MANY THREATS
I GET EACH WEEK?

22:50.125 --> 22:51.333
- THIS ONE IS REAL.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.667
- PLEASE.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.625
UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME PROOF...

23:09.125 --> 23:11.291
- ONE ELEVATOR
AND ONE SET OF STAIRS

23:11.291 --> 23:12.834
EQUALS TWO EXITS.

23:12.834 --> 23:15.208
FINALLY, SOME USE FOR TRAVIS.

23:23.792 --> 23:24.875
- NICE PLACE.

23:24.875 --> 23:26.291
- THANK GELLAR.

23:26.291 --> 23:28.000
HE FOUND IT.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.583
- SO THIS
IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED.

23:29.583 --> 23:30.792
[slicing]

23:30.792 --> 23:33.458
- AND WHERE IT'S GOING TO END.

23:33.458 --> 23:35.083
- THIS HAS BECOME VERY IMPORTANT
TO YOU,

23:35.083 --> 23:37.625
KILLING TRAVIS' DARK PASSENGER.

23:37.625 --> 23:41.083
- YES.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.875
- I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING
FOR A CHANCE

23:42.875 --> 23:45.250
TO GET RID OF YOURS.

23:45.250 --> 23:50.125
- I'M NOT SURE
YOU EVEN TRIED.

23:50.125 --> 23:52.250
YOU JUST REFOCUSED IT.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.875
- SO WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH HIM
ONCE GELLAR'S GONE?

23:54.875 --> 23:56.917
- ALLOW HIM TO START OVER.

23:56.917 --> 24:01.458
I KNOW OF A FEW PEOPLE WHO
AREN'T USING THEIR IDENTITIES.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.583
- YOUR SLIDES.

24:03.583 --> 24:07.834
- I KILL GELLAR,
AND TRAVIS GETS A SECOND CHANCE.

24:07.834 --> 24:10.709
THE ONE I'LL NEVER HAVE.

24:13.542 --> 24:15.375
WHAT IS GELLAR LIKE?

24:15.375 --> 24:17.000
- FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.125
I TOOK HIS CLASS,

24:19.125 --> 24:23.250
AND HE TOOK ME
UNDER HIS WING.

24:23.250 --> 24:27.917
MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS PART
OF SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

24:29.458 --> 24:34.417
AND I KNOW
IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

24:34.417 --> 24:38.125
BUT HE CONVINCED ME
THAT GOD HAD CHOSEN US

24:38.125 --> 24:42.792
TO BECOME THE TWO WITNESSES.

24:42.792 --> 24:45.792
- AND WHAT
DO THE TWO WITNESSES DO?

24:45.792 --> 24:47.959
- THEY ENACT
THE BOOK OF REVELATION

24:47.959 --> 24:50.667
AND BRING ABOUT THE NEW WORLD.

24:50.667 --> 24:54.959
- BY ENDING THIS ONE.

24:54.959 --> 24:57.083
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO DO THAT?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.542
- HAVE YOU EVER WANTED
TO WIPE EVERYTHING CLEAN

25:02.542 --> 25:05.625
AND START YOUR WHOLE LIFE
ALL OVER AGAIN?

25:17.166 --> 25:19.000
- ONCE GELLAR'S GONE,
YOU CAN START AGAIN.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.625
[engine turns over]

25:26.166 --> 25:27.750
- THERE'S GELLAR.

25:27.750 --> 25:29.625
- LET'S GO.

25:39.208 --> 25:41.291
- I'M GONNA TAKE THE ELEVATOR.

25:41.291 --> 25:44.583
IF GELLAR TOOK THE STAIRS,
MAYBE I CAN HEAD HIM OFF.

25:44.583 --> 25:47.709
WATCH THE STAIRS, MAKE SURE
HE DOESN'T DOUBLE BACK ON ME.

25:47.709 --> 25:49.875
STAY HERE.

25:53.041 --> 25:55.375
GELLAR DOESN'T HAVE
MUCH OF A HEAD START.

25:55.375 --> 25:58.500
[elevator lurches and stalls
repeatedly]

26:02.208 --> 26:04.959
HE KNOWS I'M HERE.

[alarm blares]

27:00.041 --> 27:02.375

[glass shatters]

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
GELLAR.

27:24.792 --> 27:26.291
- SORRY.

27:26.291 --> 27:27.500
YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO MOVE--

27:27.500 --> 27:28.625
- DID YOU SEE GELLAR?

27:28.625 --> 27:29.792
- NO.

27:37.125 --> 27:39.000
- STAY BEHIND ME.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.709
- THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

27:52.709 --> 27:55.500
- TRAVIS IS PROVING
TO BE MY PENANCE.

27:57.333 --> 28:00.500
THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH BLOOD.

28:00.500 --> 28:05.000
CASEY COULD STILL BE ALIVE.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.792
LET'S GO.

28:17.417 --> 28:19.625
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE LOST HIM.

28:19.625 --> 28:24.333
AND CASEY,
HE'S GONNA KILL HIM.

28:24.333 --> 28:27.458
- WE CAN STILL STOP HIM.

28:27.458 --> 28:28.667
- HOW?

28:28.667 --> 28:31.583
- THROUGH YOU.

28:31.583 --> 28:33.500
THIS BLOG
THAT GELLAR WRITES,

28:33.500 --> 28:35.834
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM?

28:35.834 --> 28:39.375
SEND A MESSAGE TO HIM.

28:39.375 --> 28:41.083
TELL HIM
YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND

28:41.083 --> 28:42.542
AND YOU NEED TO SEE HIM.

28:42.542 --> 28:45.667
- I'LL DO IT RIGHT NOW.

28:47.250 --> 28:50.500
[sirens wailing]

28:50.500 --> 28:52.667
- JUST KEEP SENDING MESSAGES.

28:52.667 --> 28:55.542

TRAVIS POSTED
AS THE PRODIGAL SON,

29:01.041 --> 29:04.083
ASKING IF IT'S OKAY FOR HIM
TO MAKE HIS WAY BACK HOME.

29:04.083 --> 29:07.375
NO RESPONSE FROM GELLAR.

29:07.375 --> 29:08.709
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

29:08.709 --> 29:11.417

FIGHT CRIME?

29:11.417 --> 29:14.291

I'M ON MY WAY.

29:26.709 --> 29:28.709
CASEY'S LECTURE HALL.
OF COURSE.

29:28.709 --> 29:31.000
GELLAR LAID HIM OUT
WHERE HE PREACHES

29:31.000 --> 29:34.750
HIS GODLESS DOCTRINE
TO THE YOUNG AND IMPRESSIONABLE.

29:36.750 --> 29:38.875
[radio chatter]

29:43.875 --> 29:46.000
- THIS IS
PROFESSOR TRENT CASEY.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.750
HE'S AN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST

29:47.750 --> 29:49.166
AND NOTED ATHEIST.

29:49.166 --> 29:50.500
- CHECK IT OUT.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.375
THE ABDOMEN'S GOT
A ALPHA-OMEGA CARVED INTO IT.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.625
- SIMILAR TO THE FRUIT VENDOR.

29:54.625 --> 29:55.750
- ONLY THIS GUY'S
MISSING STITCHES.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.458
- AND A HAND.

29:57.458 --> 29:59.291
- THAT'S NEW.

29:59.291 --> 30:01.458
THE PUCKERING
ON THE WRIST TISSUE

30:01.458 --> 30:03.125
INDICATES THE HAND WAS REMOVED
POST-MORTEM.

30:03.125 --> 30:06.667
AND JUDGING FROM HIS PALLOR,
ALL HIS BLOOD'S BEEN DRAINED.

30:06.667 --> 30:09.166
- LOOKS LIKE HE WAS STRUNG UP
AND BLED OUT.

30:09.166 --> 30:10.959
- GELLAR TOOK ANOTHER PAGE

30:10.959 --> 30:13.917
FROM MY BROTHER BRIAN'S
PLAYBOOK.

30:16.166 --> 30:19.208
HIS STOMACH CAVITY'S
BEEN HOLLOWED OUT.

30:19.208 --> 30:23.291
- ANY BETS ON THE PRIZE
DDK LEFT INSIDE?

30:23.291 --> 30:25.208
- UNIS SWEPT THE ROOM.

30:25.208 --> 30:27.625
THEY DIDN'T FIND
ANY TRIP WIRES OR BLOOD.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.542
- SO IF THIS
IS THE BOWLS OF WRATH,

30:29.542 --> 30:32.542
THEN, WHAT, IS IT GONNA SHOW UP
IN A BOWL SOMEWHERE?

30:32.542 --> 30:34.917
OPEN HIM UP.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.875
- BRACE YOURSELVES
FOR AWFUL.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.625
- UH.

30:43.625 --> 30:46.041
- HE'S EMPTY.

30:46.041 --> 30:49.750
- SO, THEN, WHERE ARE THE BOWLS
OF WRATH?

30:49.750 --> 30:51.792
- LET'S GET HIM
TO THE M.E.'S OFFICE.

30:51.792 --> 30:53.917

- I GOT IT.

30:53.917 --> 30:56.125
- QUINN'S RIGHT.

30:56.125 --> 31:00.834
IF EACH BOWL IS A PLAGUE

- OH, MY GOD.

31:09.417 --> 31:11.291
WHAT THE FUCK?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.291
- GELLAR HASN'T SEEN WRATH

31:17.291 --> 31:19.542
UNTIL HE'S SEEN MINE.

31:19.542 --> 31:21.667
- [gasps]

32:13.208 --> 32:14.834

DROPPED ON MY HEAD?

32:14.834 --> 32:16.542
IT'S LIKE
A PERFECT FUCKING METAPHOR

32:16.542 --> 32:18.000
FOR MY ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.333
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
I BELIEVE IN GOD,

32:19.333 --> 32:21.917
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
HE HATES ME.

32:21.917 --> 32:25.333
- LOSING YOUR PARENTS
IS DIFFICULT.

32:25.333 --> 32:30.166
HAVING A LOVED ONE SHOT
IN FRONT OF YOU IS UNTHINKABLE.

32:30.166 --> 32:32.250
FINDING OUT THAT YOUR FIANCE
IS A SERIAL KILLER--

32:32.250 --> 32:36.667
- DID I MENTION THAT HE WAS
DEXTER'S BIOLOGICAL BROTHER?

32:36.667 --> 32:39.583
- NO, YOU DID NOT.

32:39.583 --> 32:40.917
SO WAIT A MINUTE--

32:40.917 --> 32:42.834
THE ICE TRUCK KILLER
WAS YOUR BROTHER?

32:42.834 --> 32:45.291
- NO.
DEXTER WAS ADOPTED.

32:45.291 --> 32:47.417
SO WE'RE NOT BLOOD-RELATED.

32:47.417 --> 32:50.750
- OH.

32:50.750 --> 32:53.959
- WHAT?
WHAT DOES THAT "OH" MEAN?

32:53.959 --> 32:55.208
- YOU MENTIONED
THAT YOUR FATHER

32:55.208 --> 32:58.000
DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION
TO YOU.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.792
WHAT WAS HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH DEXTER LIKE?

32:59.792 --> 33:04.083
- THEY DID
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

33:04.083 --> 33:08.333
- AND WITHOUT YOUR MOTHER...

33:08.333 --> 33:10.083
- I WAS LEFT BEHIND.

33:11.792 --> 33:15.792
- YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD, DEBRA.

33:15.792 --> 33:17.875
BUT IT'S GONNA MEAN
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY

33:17.875 --> 33:19.417
FOR YOUR FEELINGS
AND YOUR CHOICES.

33:19.417 --> 33:20.917
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.834
- PLEASE DON'T
MISUNDERSTAND ME.

33:25.834 --> 33:28.333
I AM VERY SENSITIVE
TO THE TRAUMA

33:28.333 --> 33:30.333
AND THE TRAGEDY
THAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED.

33:30.333 --> 33:33.625
BUT, AS FAR
AS YOUR FAILED RELATIONSHIPS

33:33.625 --> 33:35.458
ARE CONCERNED...

33:37.333 --> 33:38.709
- WHAT?

33:38.709 --> 33:41.208
- WE ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE PARTNERS WE CHOOSE.

33:41.208 --> 33:44.333
- BULLSHIT.

33:44.333 --> 33:46.250
HOW THE FUCK WAS I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW

33:46.250 --> 33:49.125
THAT RUDY WAS
THE ICE TRUCK KILLER?

33:51.041 --> 33:53.000
ARE YOU SAYING THAT I CHOSE
TO BE WITH A SERIAL KILLER

33:53.000 --> 33:54.166
ON PURPOSE?

33:54.166 --> 33:56.041
- I THINK YOU HAVE
A HISTORY OF CHOOSING

33:56.041 --> 33:58.125
INAPPROPRIATE
OR UNAVAILABLE MEN.

33:58.125 --> 34:01.834
- WELL, WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

34:01.834 --> 34:04.417
THAT MY LIFE IS A TRAIN WRECK
OF A DISASTER?

34:04.417 --> 34:06.875
THAT MY LIFE IS A SHITHOLE?
WELL, I ALREADY KNOW THIS.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.375
THIS ISN'T NEWS TO ME, OKAY?

34:08.375 --> 34:09.834
I KNOW
THAT I AM BROKEN.

34:09.834 --> 34:11.875
- DO YOU KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE?

34:11.875 --> 34:15.792
YOU CAN PICK UP THE PIECES.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.625
- HOW?
- BY MAKING DIFFERENT CHOICES.

34:18.625 --> 34:20.667
BY BREAKING YOUR PATTERNS.

34:20.667 --> 34:24.000
DEBRA, IT'S GONNA BE HARD.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.500
BUT YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF
WHOLE AGAIN.

34:26.500 --> 34:29.458
YOU CAN.

YOU OKAY?

34:43.625 --> 34:46.583

TO TALK TO YOU

ABOUT YOUR REQUEST TO OPEN
THE DEAD CALL GIRL'S CASE.

34:49.542 --> 34:51.458
- AND?

34:51.458 --> 34:53.959
- YOU CAN'T AFFORD
TO PUT AN UNSOLVED

34:53.959 --> 34:55.583
BACK ON YOUR PLATE.
- JESUS FUCK.

34:55.583 --> 34:56.792
ARE WE REALLY GONNA DO THIS
AGAIN?

34:56.792 --> 34:58.250

RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

YOU'RE GONNA SAY
IT'S NOT HAPPENING

MORE SUSPICIOUS.

UNTIL I DID CPR

36:06.250 --> 36:09.083

DOESN'T SHE KNOW
WHEN TO BACK OFF?

36:19.709 --> 36:22.792
- WELL, ISN'T THAT TENACITY
THE REASON YOU PROMOTED HER

36:22.792 --> 36:25.792
IN THE FIRST PLACE?
AGAINST MY ADVICE, OF COURSE.

37:59.917 --> 38:01.208
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T WANT
A CHAIR.

38:01.208 --> 38:03.417
I WANT A TABLE.

38:03.417 --> 38:05.667
- WHAT ARE YOU EVEN SAYING?

38:05.667 --> 38:08.166
- NEVER MIND.

38:08.166 --> 38:10.375
- ARE WE OKAY?

38:12.125 --> 38:14.750
- I HAVE NO IDEA
IF YOU ARE.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.750
I'M SURE NOT,
BUT I'M WORKING ON IT.

38:24.250 --> 38:26.458
- LOUIS GREENE IS THE MAN.

38:26.458 --> 38:28.250
- EASY WITH THE BROMANCE.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.625
YOU'RE GONNA PITCH A TENT.

38:29.625 --> 38:30.834
- WELL, JUST REMEMBER
THAT I DISCOVERED HIM

38:30.834 --> 38:32.083
WHEN I'M UP FOR REVIEW.

38:32.083 --> 38:33.417
- WHAT'D HE DO?

38:33.417 --> 38:36.291
- UNSCRAMBLED THE I.P.A.
OF GELLAR'S BLOGS

38:36.291 --> 38:40.125
AND TRACKED IT
TO AN ADDRESS.

38:40.125 --> 38:42.125
- ANDERSON, GRAB YOUR GEAR.

38:42.125 --> 38:44.291
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.458
- YEAH, THAT'S MY I.P. ADDRESS,

38:48.458 --> 38:50.667
BUT IT'S UNSECURED,
SO I COULDN'T TELL YOU

38:50.667 --> 38:52.125
WHO ALL USES THE SIGNAL.

38:52.125 --> 38:53.458
- WHAT'S THE SIGNAL'S RANGE?

38:53.458 --> 38:54.959
- GIVE OR TAKE 500 FEET.

38:54.959 --> 38:56.834
- WELL, YOU'RE PUTTING OUT
1,000 MILLIWATTS.

38:56.834 --> 39:00.166
I'M GUESSING IT'S PROBABLY
CLOSER TO 900 FEET.

39:00.166 --> 39:02.166
- THESE GUYS EVER
COME IN HERE?

39:02.166 --> 39:05.083
- I WOULDN'T KNOW,
BUT I CAN KEEP AN EYE OUT

39:05.083 --> 39:06.667
IF YOU WANT.
- YEAH, WE'D APPRECIATE THAT.

39:06.667 --> 39:09.333
- YOU BET.

39:09.333 --> 39:10.792
- YOU KNOW, YOUR GUYS
COULD DRIVE UP ANYTIME,

39:10.792 --> 39:13.000
USE THEIR LAPTOP, AND NEVER
EVEN GET OUT OF THEIR CAR.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.750
- UP TO 900 FEET?

39:14.750 --> 39:16.542
- GIVE OR TAKE.

39:16.542 --> 39:18.000
FURTHER IF THERE'S AN ANTENNA
WITHIN RANGE.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.333
- WHAT WOULD THAT DO?

39:19.333 --> 39:23.208
- BOOST THE SIGNAL
BY A COUPLE MILES.

39:23.208 --> 39:25.375
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

39:25.375 --> 39:27.792
- I WANT TO BRING IN SOME UNIS,
HAVE THEM FAN OUT,

39:27.792 --> 39:31.166
CANVASS THE SURROUNDING AREA,
SEE WHAT THEY COME UP WITH.

39:31.166 --> 39:34.875
LOUIS, I'D BUY YOU A BEER,
BUT IT HAS BEEN A LONG DAY.

39:34.875 --> 39:37.792
- THANKS.
I HAVE PLANS ANYWAY.

39:46.291 --> 39:49.041
- UH...

39:49.041 --> 39:51.125
WOW.
- [snickers]

39:51.125 --> 39:54.375
PEOPLE LOVE THEIR GAMES.

39:54.375 --> 39:57.458
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY IN IT.
- YEAH.

39:57.458 --> 40:02.333
I GUESS.

40:02.333 --> 40:06.709
YOU HAVE QUITE
THE COLLECTION...

40:06.709 --> 40:11.834
OF COLLECTIONS.

40:11.834 --> 40:15.041
- YEAH, I DON'T--I DON'T
LET A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HERE.

40:15.041 --> 40:16.291
IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS

40:16.291 --> 40:21.250
I'M OVERCOMPENSATING
FOR SOMETHING.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.166
- OH, I'VE BEEN KNOWN
TO COLLECT.

40:23.166 --> 40:24.583
- YEAH?
- MM-HMM.

40:24.583 --> 40:28.250
I WENT THROUGH AN '80s PHASE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

40:28.250 --> 40:32.792
I HAD A ZILLION
OF THOSE BLACK RUBBER BRACELETS.

40:32.792 --> 40:35.667
WORE THEM LIKE BODY ARMOR.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.375
- SO...

40:37.375 --> 40:41.083
- SO WEIRD I UNDERSTAND.

40:43.208 --> 40:46.250
BUT WHY DID YOU BLOW ME OFF?

40:46.250 --> 40:48.875
- I WAS, UM--

40:48.875 --> 40:52.291
I WAS TRYING TO BE RESPECTFUL
OF SERGEANT BATISTA,

40:52.291 --> 40:54.709
A.K.A. YOUR BROTHER,
WHO HAPPENS TO CARRY

40:54.709 --> 40:58.583
A VERY LARGE GUN,
BY THE WAY.

40:58.583 --> 41:03.041
HE SORT OF GENTLY SUGGESTED
THAT I BACK OFF.

41:03.041 --> 41:05.041
- HE SCARED YOU.

41:05.041 --> 41:07.125
- DOES IT MAKE ME A PUSSY
IF I SAY YES?

41:07.125 --> 41:10.667
- IT MAKES YOU HONEST.

41:35.583 --> 41:38.667
[moaning and grunting]

41:58.792 --> 42:00.667
- THERE'S ANOTHER DOOR
ALONG THAT SIDE

42:00.667 --> 42:02.000
AT THE WEST NARTHEX,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.125
AND A DOOR
AT THE VERY END

42:04.125 --> 42:06.667
JUST OFF THE SACRISTY.

42:06.667 --> 42:08.500
- BUT YOU ALWAYS GO
IN THE MAIN ENTRANCE?

42:08.500 --> 42:10.667
- WE BOTH DO.
- THEN GO IN THAT WAY.

42:10.667 --> 42:14.375
- AND THEN WHAT?

42:14.375 --> 42:18.000
- JUST TALK TO HIM,
TELL HIM YOU MADE A MISTAKE,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.166
THAT YOU'RE SORRY.
KEEP HIM ENGAGED.

42:20.166 --> 42:22.333
- AND WHAT WILL YOU DO?

42:22.333 --> 42:25.083
- I'LL GO IN THE BACK WAY.

42:25.083 --> 42:28.250
- AND THEN...

42:28.250 --> 42:30.417
- IT'S BETTER
YOU DON'T KNOW.

42:33.041 --> 42:34.667
- YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

42:34.667 --> 42:38.875
- OH, IT'S NOT THAT.
- NO, I UNDERSTAND.

42:38.875 --> 42:40.000
GELLAR'S TOO SMART.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.208
I'D JUST GIVE IT AWAY.

42:42.208 --> 42:44.709
JUST DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

42:47.583 --> 42:49.375
- I WILL.

43:22.792 --> 43:24.959
- HELLO, TRAVIS.

43:24.959 --> 43:28.667
- PROFESSOR GELLAR.

43:28.667 --> 43:33.750
- I'M KIND OF SURPRISED
YOU HAVEN'T BURST INTO FLAMES.

43:33.750 --> 43:37.375
GOD IS VERY KIND.

43:37.375 --> 43:40.542
- GOD DOESN'T WANT
TO HURT ME.

43:40.542 --> 43:42.750
- DON'T FUCKIN' TELL ME
WHAT GOD WANTS

43:42.750 --> 43:44.834
OR DOESN'T WANT.

43:44.834 --> 43:47.458
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.291
- YOU'RE WRONG.

43:50.291 --> 43:53.375
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN A GOD OF VIOLENCE--

43:53.375 --> 43:55.291
- THEN GO READ YOUR BIBLE.

43:55.291 --> 43:56.875
BECAUSE GOD PROMISES

43:56.875 --> 43:59.792
THAT THE DEVIOUS TONGUE
WILL BE CUT OUT.

43:59.792 --> 44:01.834
AND HE WILL TEAR YOU
LIMB FROM LIMB

44:01.834 --> 44:05.417
AND DESTROY THEE FOREVER.

44:05.417 --> 44:08.250
REPENT YOUR SINS, TRAVIS,

44:08.250 --> 44:12.959
OR YOU WILL BURN
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

44:12.959 --> 44:16.417
- I HAVE ONLY TRIED TO DO
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT,

44:16.417 --> 44:19.667
WHAT I THOUGHT--
- NO!

44:19.667 --> 44:22.959
GOD HAS GIVEN YOU
SO MANY CHANCES,

44:22.959 --> 44:26.542
AND YOU DISAPPOINT HIM
TIME AFTER TIME.

44:26.542 --> 44:30.166
BUT HE LOVES YOU.

44:30.166 --> 44:33.917
HE TRULY LOVES YOU.

44:33.917 --> 44:38.667
HE'S GONNA GIVE YOU
ONE MORE CHANCE.

44:38.667 --> 44:41.667
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LISTEN TO ME.

44:44.083 --> 44:46.792
COME TO ME.

45:06.709 --> 45:11.333
- YOU'VE GOT A LOT RIDING ON
THIS SECOND CHANCE FOR TRAVIS.

45:11.333 --> 45:13.417
- IT'S UP TO HIM
WHAT HE DOES WITH HIS LIFE

45:13.417 --> 45:14.709
ONCE I'M DONE WITH GELLAR.

45:14.709 --> 45:17.041
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR LIFE?

45:17.041 --> 45:18.417
- MY LIFE?

45:18.417 --> 45:20.458
- DEXTER, THE POLICE
ARE CLOSING IN ON GELLAR.

45:20.458 --> 45:21.709
YOU'RE TAKING A RISK HERE.

45:21.709 --> 45:23.250
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT TRAVIS.

45:23.250 --> 45:24.792
YOU'RE NOT THAT UNSELFISH.

45:24.792 --> 45:27.583
- I'M MORE
THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT I'D BE.

45:27.583 --> 45:30.166
- SO IF YOU REMOVE
TRAVIS' DARK PASSENGER,

45:30.166 --> 45:32.750
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
OUT OF THIS?

45:32.750 --> 45:37.333
- MAYBE...I CAN LEARN
TO CONTROL MY OWN.

45:37.333 --> 45:40.417
MAYBE I CAN BE...

45:40.417 --> 45:42.250
A BETTER...
- A BETTER WHAT?

45:42.250 --> 45:43.875
A BETTER PERSON?

45:43.875 --> 45:45.917
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT
BEING A BETTER PERSON.

45:45.917 --> 45:47.166
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

45:47.166 --> 45:49.041
- THEN WHAT DO YOU CARE ABOUT?

45:52.625 --> 45:57.542
- A BETTER FATHER
TO MY SON.

45:57.542 --> 46:00.458
IS THAT SO SURPRISING
TO YOU?

46:04.250 --> 46:08.959
I WANT TO BE A BETTER FATHER
FOR HARRISON.

46:16.667 --> 46:18.750
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

47:14.417 --> 47:16.208
TRAVIS.

47:16.208 --> 47:19.250
HE'S STILL BREATHING.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.417
TRAVIS.

47:21.417 --> 47:23.375
WHERE IS GELLAR?

47:23.375 --> 47:26.000
[machinery whirring]

48:57.083 --> 48:59.125
GELLAR.

49:05.041 --> 49:08.125
HE'S BEEN DEAD ALL ALONG.

49:10.583 --> 49:13.125
DID TRAVIS ACT ALONE?

49:16.667 --> 49:20.959
DID TRAVIS KILL
ALL THOSE PEOPLE?
