01:08.707 --> 01:10.006
As the Earth continues to heat up

01:10.084 --> 01:12.502
and devastating droughts
and famine plague the population,

01:12.596 --> 01:17.863
science is looking for a new planet
on which human life can thrive.

01:17.950 --> 01:23.067
And it finds that in year 2063.

01:25.671 --> 01:27.706
The blue
indicates water.

01:27.740 --> 01:30.475
The red is oxygen.

01:30.508 --> 01:34.278
This is our best chance
to find a habitable planet.

01:34.312 --> 01:35.881
One we can colonize

01:35.914 --> 01:39.517
and so ensure the
survival of our species.

01:39.551 --> 01:41.854
With the deteriorating
situation here on Earth,

01:41.887 --> 01:44.188
it's essential we send
a scouting mission

01:44.222 --> 01:46.959
as soon as possible.

01:46.992 --> 01:50.361
The voyage there will
take 86 years.

01:50.395 --> 01:53.197
So, the crew will
reproduce onboard the ship,

01:53.231 --> 01:57.335
and their grandchildren will be
the ones who reach the planet.

02:09.848 --> 02:11.784
Nobel
laureate in physics,

02:14.953 --> 02:18.691
say hello to
MIT bio-engineer.

02:52.758 --> 02:56.595
Our first challenge was finding
30 qualified crew members

02:56.628 --> 02:59.430
able to cope with the stress
of prolonged confinement.

02:59.464 --> 03:02.534
That and the knowledge that
they won't be coming back.

03:02.568 --> 03:06.504
Our solution,
breed and raise our own crew.

03:06.538 --> 03:09.875
Train them in isolation
so they won't miss Earth.

03:09.908 --> 03:12.443
Then the next
step is to assess

03:12.477 --> 03:15.047
when they'll be
ready to go.

03:15.080 --> 03:18.449
The younger they are,
the longer we can conserve resources

03:18.483 --> 03:21.352
and extend the timeline
of the mission.

03:21.385 --> 03:24.388
But they will be on
the ship alone.

03:24.422 --> 03:26.759
And while I have every
confidence in our education

03:26.792 --> 03:28.326
and management system,

03:30.028 --> 03:32.664
I'm most concerned
that they

03:32.698 --> 03:33.832
be able to combat
the dangers

03:33.866 --> 03:35.500
they may face
along the way.

03:38.369 --> 03:40.338
Some we're just
beginning to understand.

04:24.850 --> 04:26.885
<i>Decontamination complete.</i>

04:44.770 --> 04:46.839
- Richard!
- Richard!

04:51.109 --> 04:52.144
Richard.

04:56.582 --> 04:59.450
How would you
solve that one?

05:09.027 --> 05:10.028
Good.

05:16.068 --> 05:17.836
Sleep well,
Christopher.

05:19.004 --> 05:20.939
Sleep well, Sela.

05:20.973 --> 05:22.074
Sleep well, Zac.

05:23.609 --> 05:24.877
I'm scared.

05:26.111 --> 05:27.613
Of what?

05:27.646 --> 05:29.513
I don't know.

05:29.548 --> 05:31.016
There's nothing
to be scared of.

05:32.217 --> 05:33.451
You're safe.

05:40.524 --> 05:41.593
I want
to go with them.

05:43.629 --> 05:45.163
It's a one-way
trip, Richard.

05:45.197 --> 05:47.431
There is no
coming back.

05:47.465 --> 05:48.767
You'll die up there.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.936
I'll die down
here eventually.

05:50.969 --> 05:52.871
Seems the same
to me.

05:52.905 --> 05:55.607
The whole reason
we're raising them this way

05:55.641 --> 05:57.542
is for their
mental health.

05:57.576 --> 06:01.947
So they don't miss wide open
spaces, sunlight, people.

06:01.980 --> 06:03.749
Now you,
on the other hand,

06:03.782 --> 06:04.650
are going to have a hard
time dealing with...

06:04.683 --> 06:05.951
I wouldn't miss a thing.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.154
It's not part
of the plan.

06:09.187 --> 06:11.690
I know, I know,
but think of it like this.

06:11.723 --> 06:13.759
You'll be able
to launch sooner

06:14.793 --> 06:15.794
if I go with them.

06:17.262 --> 06:19.463
Four years instead
of seven.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.602
Someone should be
there to raise them.

06:25.503 --> 06:26.504
To protect them.

06:29.808 --> 06:31.509
You know I'm right.

06:38.650 --> 06:40.786
<i>T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

06:40.819 --> 06:45.924
<i>We are go for launch.
13, 12, 11...</i>

06:45.958 --> 06:47.826
<i>Switch from GLC to OBC.</i>

06:49.127 --> 06:51.563
<i>...6, 5...</i>

06:51.596 --> 06:53.532
<i>Go main engines.</i>

06:53.565 --> 06:56.168
<i>...3, 2, 1...</i>

07:41.313 --> 07:43.048
- All right.
- You good?

07:43.081 --> 07:44.282
Yeah.

07:44.316 --> 07:45.984
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

07:50.689 --> 07:52.157
<i>Hatch closing.</i>

09:17.309 --> 09:18.677
<i>You are the link between past</i>

09:18.710 --> 09:20.679
<i>and future generations</i>

09:20.712 --> 09:22.981
<i>and have been entrusted with
the survival of our species.</i>

09:23.014 --> 09:24.983
<i>You will have children
onboard the ship,</i>

09:25.016 --> 09:27.719
<i>and your grandchildren will be
the ones to reach the planet.</i>

09:27.752 --> 09:29.421
<i>On-ship reproduction will occur</i>

09:29.454 --> 09:32.057
<i>via artificial fertilization
and incubation</i>

09:32.090 --> 09:36.161
<i>during each generation's 24th year
in order to maximize resources.</i>

11:01.846 --> 11:06.785
<i>Well, we're the first generation,
so we won't ever see the planet.</i>

11:06.818 --> 11:08.186
We'll never know
what they discover.

11:09.020 --> 11:10.488
That's true.

11:10.522 --> 11:12.824
Our lives
are unimportant.

11:12.857 --> 11:14.859
No, your life,

11:14.893 --> 11:16.895
my life is as
important as anyone's.

11:17.563 --> 11:18.763
Here or on Earth.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.135
Let me show
you something.

11:27.105 --> 11:29.174
Not supposed to let
anyone see these.

11:30.475 --> 11:34.179
That is my father
and his parents.

11:34.212 --> 11:36.147
My grandparents.

11:36.181 --> 11:39.417
I never knew them,
but I know they lived an honest life.

11:39.451 --> 11:43.154
You know, they took care of their
family, they provided for the future.

11:43.188 --> 11:44.889
That's all any
of us can do.

12:50.889 --> 12:52.223
What's up?

12:52.257 --> 12:53.992
There's a toxin in
the irrigation water.

12:55.661 --> 12:58.430
Well, replace the filter
and test it again.

12:58.463 --> 13:00.932
It's coming from us,
it's in our urine.

13:00.965 --> 13:02.067
Yeah, it's from
something we've eaten.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.637
Are we eating
something toxic?

13:04.670 --> 13:08.940
Maybe toxic for a plant
that relies solely on water,

13:08.973 --> 13:10.075
but you're stronger
than that.

13:12.344 --> 13:14.412
What is it?
What's the chemical?

13:14.446 --> 13:17.082
I don't know.
Just change that filter.

13:34.132 --> 13:35.333
Hey.

13:35.367 --> 13:36.602
What do you
make of this?

13:38.571 --> 13:40.573
It's an ingredient
in something we eat.

13:44.042 --> 13:45.510
Why would that
be unavailable?

13:56.121 --> 13:57.122
Let's go.

14:10.502 --> 14:12.237
How'd you get
past the firewall?

14:12.270 --> 14:14.573
By connecting
directly to the processor.

14:14.607 --> 14:16.675
It's the same way I got
into the design plans.

14:23.348 --> 14:24.949
- Hmm.
- Try "Nutrition."

14:27.318 --> 14:28.587
It's not there.

14:28.621 --> 14:30.221
Is it some kind
of vitamin?

14:30.255 --> 14:31.256
Maybe

14:32.056 --> 14:33.124
medication.

14:38.062 --> 14:39.297
Here we go.

14:44.502 --> 14:47.673
"...the active ingredient
in daily beverage A.02."

14:49.240 --> 14:51.109
"Combine with blue
alkaline syrup

14:51.142 --> 14:52.277
"to counter
stomach irritation."

14:52.310 --> 14:53.311
Blue.

14:54.412 --> 14:55.480
It's the blue.

14:57.315 --> 15:00.151
"...effect is enhanced when
consuming it with food."

15:00.185 --> 15:02.387
What effect?

15:02.420 --> 15:05.023
I thought it was just
an enzyme for digestion.

15:08.026 --> 15:11.196
"...personality
becomes dull and docile..."

15:11.229 --> 15:14.700
"...eliminates sexual
desire and sensation..."

15:14.733 --> 15:16.434
"...decreased pleasure
response..."

15:16.468 --> 15:18.470
Decreased pleasure
response?

15:20.071 --> 15:22.140
I want
increased pleasure.

15:24.743 --> 15:26.044
They're drugging us.

15:31.049 --> 15:32.317
So they
can control us.

15:33.151 --> 15:34.219
Pacify us.

15:35.721 --> 15:38.189
They don't want us
to reproduce naturally.

15:38.223 --> 15:39.725
They don't want us
to have sexual relations.

15:39.758 --> 15:43.194
So we don't feel what
that feels like.

15:43.228 --> 15:45.163
And so we don't
overpopulate the ship.

15:45.764 --> 15:47.065
To conserve food.

15:48.534 --> 15:49.535
I don't care.

15:50.502 --> 15:51.604
I'm not
drinking it.

16:04.249 --> 16:05.483
So, Richard
lied to you.

16:06.351 --> 16:07.686
The mission lies.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.387
What else aren't
they telling us?

16:11.690 --> 16:14.192
Well, Christopher found
a hidden compartment.

16:14.225 --> 16:15.393
In the
ship's plans.

16:15.426 --> 16:16.729
Where is it?

16:17.863 --> 16:19.264
In Pod-23.

16:19.297 --> 16:20.633
Unmarked behind
a wall.

16:22.367 --> 16:23.569
What's inside?

16:23.602 --> 16:25.103
I don't know yet.

16:25.136 --> 16:26.437
Don't tell Richard
you went off the blue.

16:26.471 --> 16:28.506
He's going to force
them back on it anyway.

16:28.541 --> 16:31.276
Yeah, maybe. By then,
we'll know what it feels like.

16:31.309 --> 16:33.444
What does it
feel like?

16:33.478 --> 16:35.246
Has anything changed
since you stopped?

16:35.280 --> 16:37.348
- Yes, but...
- Where's my pleasure?

16:45.456 --> 16:46.457
Here.

16:48.861 --> 16:50.663
Ow.

16:54.667 --> 16:55.768
A little jolt.

16:55.801 --> 16:57.435
- A bolt.
- A bite.

16:57.468 --> 16:59.170
You know that's a
waste of electricity.

17:01.406 --> 17:02.473
Go away.

17:04.375 --> 17:05.376
So...

17:07.311 --> 17:09.480
What have you been thinking
about since our last session?

17:11.182 --> 17:12.183
Nothing.

17:13.719 --> 17:15.621
Come on,
nothing?

17:15.654 --> 17:18.522
Well, I guess
I was wondering

17:18.557 --> 17:19.625
why do you lie to us?

17:20.726 --> 17:23.127
What do you think
I lied about?

17:23.161 --> 17:24.696
Well, I found
out that...

17:27.397 --> 17:28.398
What?

17:31.904 --> 17:33.404
There's an unmarked
compartment.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.875
Pod-23.

17:36.909 --> 17:40.746
Well, mission withholds certain
information for various reasons.

17:40.779 --> 17:42.548
You know,
even from me.

17:43.749 --> 17:45.249
It's not quite lying,

17:46.384 --> 17:47.553
but I get what you mean.

17:48.621 --> 17:49.622
How'd you find it?

17:51.857 --> 17:54.392
I just did.
What's inside?

17:55.561 --> 17:57.362
I don't know.

17:57.395 --> 17:59.765
I don't know. It must be
for the third generation.

17:59.798 --> 18:02.166
But why's it hidden?
Aren't you curious?

18:02.200 --> 18:03.201
I am...

18:04.903 --> 18:06.471
It's probably
reserved for them.

18:07.673 --> 18:08.774
It's for
your grandchildren.

18:10.743 --> 18:12.176
That's a profound thought.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.946
I mean, you're going
to have children,

18:13.979 --> 18:15.581
and you're going
to have grandchildren.

18:16.782 --> 18:18.149
What do you
think about that?

18:24.556 --> 18:25.824
Yeah,
they're normal kids.

18:25.858 --> 18:27.860
They're sensitive
and smart

18:27.893 --> 18:30.395
which means they know when I'm
not telling them the truth.

18:30.428 --> 18:32.798
And that's my point.

18:32.831 --> 18:35.901
I want to be honest with
them about everything.

18:37.836 --> 18:41.940
Otherwise, they'll lose
faith in me.

18:44.543 --> 18:46.645
So...

18:46.679 --> 18:49.748
I'm going to need a quick
response from you on this.

18:49.782 --> 18:50.949
That's all for now.

20:04.890 --> 20:05.891
Sela?

20:07.760 --> 20:08.761
What?

20:10.662 --> 20:11.697
You look different.

20:12.664 --> 20:13.832
I'm the same.

20:13.866 --> 20:15.901
No, you're not.
Neither am I.

20:17.335 --> 20:19.370
What are you
talking about?

20:19.403 --> 20:20.773
I don't know.
You've changed.

20:20.806 --> 20:22.273
Everything about you.

20:22.908 --> 20:24.475
Yeah, I've grown up.

20:26.545 --> 20:28.680
That's exactly what I
want to talk to you about.

20:28.714 --> 20:30.582
You have, but you're not
feeling what I'm feeling.

20:30.616 --> 20:31.750
No grabbing, Zac.

20:34.653 --> 20:36.487
I wasn't grabbing.

20:36.521 --> 20:37.723
Easy with the hands.
You know the rules.

21:06.718 --> 21:08.319
Yeah!

21:15.961 --> 21:17.763
Yeah!

22:00.105 --> 22:02.174
C'mon.

22:02.207 --> 22:03.742
I hate
those noises.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.941
Anything?

22:35.974 --> 22:37.576
No.

22:37.609 --> 22:39.578
So what's causing
the sounds?

22:39.611 --> 22:41.179
Richard says
it's the cooling

22:41.213 --> 22:42.814
and contracting of the
ship when we power down.

22:42.848 --> 22:44.616
I don't think the
temperature differential

22:44.650 --> 22:46.752
is enough to affect
the structure that way.

22:46.785 --> 22:48.519
Plus, Richard's a liar.

22:50.656 --> 22:53.524
So what is it?

22:53.558 --> 22:55.928
You think it's something
on the outside, don't you?

22:55.961 --> 22:58.563
If there's life on the
planet, why not out here?

22:59.831 --> 23:01.633
What else can
explain those sounds?

23:24.690 --> 23:26.058
What is it?

23:26.091 --> 23:28.193
Sage.

23:28.226 --> 23:30.494
Plant that grows
in warm climates.

23:37.869 --> 23:40.706
Pine needles.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.842
- It's beautiful.
- Hmm.

24:29.588 --> 24:30.922
You see that?

24:32.924 --> 24:35.060
He can touch her.
But I can't.

24:50.008 --> 24:52.177
We've lost
contact with Earth

24:52.210 --> 24:56.014
because overnight there was a
malfunction in the LCT transmitter.

24:56.048 --> 24:57.582
I'll have to go
exterior to fix it.

24:57.616 --> 24:59.051
Zac will come with me.

24:59.084 --> 25:01.720
And the rest of you
know your roles.

25:06.191 --> 25:07.626
Right here.

25:09.694 --> 25:11.630
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.950
This sensor goes on your
wrist and it attaches here,

25:31.983 --> 25:33.351
but it's tricky because
it can come loose,

25:33.385 --> 25:34.586
so just
make sure...

25:37.956 --> 25:39.391
Make sure you
pull the cuff over

25:39.424 --> 25:41.159
the inner sleeve
so that it...

25:59.177 --> 26:00.846
Hey! Hey! Hey!

26:02.347 --> 26:04.149
What's happening here?
Zac, what are you doing?

26:06.284 --> 26:08.386
You're going to lose food rations if
you don't tell me what's going on.

26:08.420 --> 26:09.721
You okay?

26:09.754 --> 26:10.922
I'm fine.

26:12.791 --> 26:13.792
Zac!

26:23.201 --> 26:24.202
Zac.

26:32.244 --> 26:33.245
Zac.

26:35.347 --> 26:37.182
Phoebe, have you
seen Zac?

26:37.215 --> 26:39.718
No. But I heard
what he did.

26:39.751 --> 26:41.253
Has he done anything
like that before?

26:41.286 --> 26:43.855
I don't know,
but he stopped taking the blue.

26:46.324 --> 26:48.093
Are you sure?

26:48.126 --> 26:49.895
I saw him
pour it out.

26:53.098 --> 26:54.099
Christopher.

26:55.901 --> 26:57.035
You seen Zac?

26:58.904 --> 27:00.305
You heard
what he did?

27:02.741 --> 27:04.309
Oh, you think
that's okay?

27:04.342 --> 27:05.744
No.

27:05.777 --> 27:07.979
Good, I'm glad
to hear it.

27:08.013 --> 27:10.482
He's not taking
the blue. Are you?

27:10.515 --> 27:12.384
Why would I?

27:12.417 --> 27:15.954
It's a drug.
You're drugging us.

27:15.987 --> 27:18.123
Mission made a decision
to administer medication

27:19.958 --> 27:22.260
to help with
impulse control.

27:23.929 --> 27:25.764
To prevent exactly this kind
of thing from happening.

27:27.365 --> 27:30.135
It's the only way to
deal with living like this.

27:30.168 --> 27:31.836
We didn't ask
to be here.

27:31.870 --> 27:33.705
Nobody chooses what
they're born into.

27:36.408 --> 27:38.076
But you have to find
a way to live your life.

27:38.109 --> 27:39.477
You gotta

27:39.511 --> 27:41.681
decide what kind of person
you want to be.

27:42.781 --> 27:44.082
You gotta try to be good.

27:44.115 --> 27:46.051
Why?

27:46.084 --> 27:47.152
We're just gonna
die in the end,

27:47.185 --> 27:49.521
so why can't we do
what we want?

27:49.555 --> 27:51.356
What's the difference
whether we're good or not?

27:51.389 --> 27:53.124
- There's a big difference.
- Well, I don't see it.

27:53.158 --> 27:54.459
Are we still
doing the repair?

27:56.161 --> 27:57.162
Yeah.

27:58.997 --> 27:59.998
C'mon.

28:07.372 --> 28:08.773
All right,
put this on.

28:08.807 --> 28:11.376
- Why?
- You're coming with me.

28:11.409 --> 28:13.178
I don't
want to go.

28:15.947 --> 28:17.849
Look, I get that
you're angry,

28:17.882 --> 28:19.417
but I need your
help with this.

28:20.952 --> 28:22.420
And the sooner
we fix it,

28:22.454 --> 28:23.488
the sooner you can
voice your objections

28:23.521 --> 28:24.823
to mission control.

28:26.458 --> 28:27.892
I'll back you up.

28:53.485 --> 28:55.453
<i>Depressurization in progress.</i>

28:57.088 --> 28:58.323
<i>90%.</i>

28:59.958 --> 29:01.293
<i>80%.</i>

29:02.961 --> 29:04.229
<i>Kai, you ready
in the systems room?</i>

29:04.262 --> 29:05.330
Yes.

29:06.264 --> 29:08.567
Control room set.

29:08.601 --> 29:10.536
<i>Med Bay
on 1 with vital signs.</i>

29:14.573 --> 29:17.208
<i>Depressurization complete.</i>

29:17.242 --> 29:18.343
<i>Opening hatch.</i>

29:22.247 --> 29:24.015
Who's with him?

29:24.049 --> 29:25.317
Christopher.

31:15.026 --> 31:17.061
<i>We're at junction box 1.</i>

31:17.095 --> 31:19.532
<i>Starting the repair.</i>

31:19.565 --> 31:21.700
<i>Shut down power
to LCT 1 transmitter.</i>

31:22.768 --> 31:25.370
Copy that.
LCT 1 shutting down.

31:43.288 --> 31:45.423
<i>Opening
junction box 1.</i>

31:48.059 --> 31:49.360
<i>Copy that.</i>

31:55.033 --> 31:57.035
<i>LCT 1 repair complete.</i>

31:58.704 --> 32:00.271
Going to LCT 2.

32:02.407 --> 32:03.408
<i>Copy that.</i>

32:04.777 --> 32:06.211
<i>LCT 2 shut down.</i>

32:20.593 --> 32:22.561
There it is.

32:22.595 --> 32:24.395
It's just the ship.

32:24.429 --> 32:25.731
Richard told us
what it is.

32:50.355 --> 32:51.590
Do you see anything?

32:54.425 --> 32:55.761
Because there's
nothing there.

33:08.541 --> 33:09.642
Richard!

33:16.481 --> 33:18.182
Richard!

33:18.216 --> 33:19.852
Richard!
Do you read me, Richard?

33:19.885 --> 33:21.620
- What happened?
- I don't know.

33:21.654 --> 33:23.154
Switching to emergency power.

33:23.187 --> 33:25.156
Check the breakers.

33:25.189 --> 33:26.190
<i>We have
a fire in the systems room.</i>

33:56.889 --> 33:58.557
Navigation errors.

33:58.591 --> 33:59.558
I don't know.
We're trying to check.

33:59.592 --> 34:00.759
Negative. No effect.

34:00.793 --> 34:03.294
Communications.

34:03.328 --> 34:05.496
The whole system's down.
We're not transmitting or receiving.

34:11.770 --> 34:14.304
No, keep the oxygen.
We're going to go again.

34:25.951 --> 34:27.185
It's not working.

34:32.290 --> 34:33.659
Are you pronouncing
him dead?

34:36.260 --> 34:37.896
It says the chief medical
officer should note

34:37.929 --> 34:39.130
the time of death.

34:59.417 --> 35:00.418
Okay.

35:01.285 --> 35:02.788
14:35 ship time.

35:17.569 --> 35:19.170
I just don't understand.

35:20.673 --> 35:21.907
What actually happened?

35:21.940 --> 35:23.274
You didn't see it?

35:23.307 --> 35:24.810
I was facing
the other way.

35:24.843 --> 35:26.344
There was
that sound.

35:28.346 --> 35:29.648
Creaking.

35:30.883 --> 35:32.751
Just before
it happened.

35:32.785 --> 35:34.285
Was anyone watching
the monitor?

35:34.318 --> 35:36.487
Yes. We didn't
see anything.

35:36.521 --> 35:37.522
I did.

35:39.357 --> 35:40.592
And?

35:40.626 --> 35:42.493
What'd you see?

35:42.528 --> 35:43.729
It looked like...

35:45.263 --> 35:47.766
Like a force
jumping into him.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.636
What do you mean?
Like a meteoroid?

35:50.669 --> 35:51.937
He means
something else.

35:53.504 --> 35:54.707
Something alien.

35:54.740 --> 35:56.307
What?

36:00.478 --> 36:02.380
It's okay.

36:02.413 --> 36:04.282
It's going
to be okay.

36:04.315 --> 36:05.584
What's going
to happen to us?

36:07.653 --> 36:08.987
We'll be okay.

36:09.021 --> 36:11.590
Whatever it was,
it was on the outside.

36:11.623 --> 36:13.391
We're safe
inside the ship.

36:13.424 --> 36:14.860
But without
Richard...

36:14.893 --> 36:17.261
We were going to be on our
own at some point anyway.

36:19.598 --> 36:20.899
It just happened early.

36:23.736 --> 36:25.436
If we keep it together,
we'll be all right.

36:34.512 --> 36:36.380
<i>System restarting.</i>

36:44.322 --> 36:45.858
Did you get an image?

36:45.891 --> 36:48.560
Everything
recorded is gone.

36:48.594 --> 36:50.863
So we can't see
what happened?

36:50.896 --> 36:52.363
The fire
in the systems room

36:52.396 --> 36:53.599
destroyed the
surveillance archive.

36:58.837 --> 37:01.272
The program says we need to
choose a new chief officer.

37:03.341 --> 37:04.408
I'll be
chief officer.

37:05.510 --> 37:07.512
I'm head
engineer now,

37:07.546 --> 37:08.914
it makes sense
that I be chief.

37:10.082 --> 37:12.383
Well, what
about Sela?

37:12.416 --> 37:15.053
She's head
medical officer.

37:15.087 --> 37:17.089
I don't want
to be chief.

37:17.122 --> 37:18.924
It says everyone
gets a vote.

37:20.391 --> 37:22.060
We have an election.

37:33.071 --> 37:35.406
And the new
chief officer is...

37:37.009 --> 37:38.309
Christopher.

37:51.156 --> 37:53.692
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

37:53.725 --> 37:55.694
First thing we have to
do is repair the damage.

37:56.460 --> 37:58.664
The LCS is down,

37:58.697 --> 38:00.532
so we won't be hearing from
Earth until we fix it.

38:01.900 --> 38:04.002
We're on our own now,

38:04.036 --> 38:05.838
but we can work our
way out of this.

38:11.076 --> 38:12.678
<i>We'll need
the entire crew</i>

38:12.711 --> 38:15.681
<i>in the damaged area
working on the repairs.</i>

38:15.714 --> 38:18.684
<i>The fire knocked out
most of the systems room.</i>

38:18.717 --> 38:21.053
<i>We'll look at electrical
and communications first.</i>

38:21.086 --> 38:23.354
<i>Pull out all the burned
equipment and replace it.</i>

38:25.724 --> 38:27.926
<i>Then we'll work
on the surveillance system.</i>

38:27.960 --> 38:29.728
<i>Try to get it up and running</i>

38:29.761 --> 38:30.929
<i>so we can see what
really happened to Richard.</i>

38:36.835 --> 38:37.836
Okay.

38:40.105 --> 38:42.774
Edward said the fire
destroyed all the surveillance.

38:42.808 --> 38:43.942
Yeah.

38:43.976 --> 38:46.011
The connections
are burned.

38:46.044 --> 38:47.846
But maybe the drives
are still intact.

39:43.769 --> 39:44.770
Hey.

39:46.571 --> 39:47.773
You okay?

39:47.806 --> 39:48.840
Yeah.

39:50.275 --> 39:51.910
What are you
doing in here?

39:51.944 --> 39:54.212
I'm supposed to destroy
his personal archive.

39:56.214 --> 39:57.515
Why?

39:57.549 --> 39:59.517
It's in
the program.

39:59.551 --> 40:00.919
They don't want
us to see it.

40:02.688 --> 40:03.689
Do I have to do it?

40:04.923 --> 40:06.591
Yes. Of course.

40:10.729 --> 40:12.130
That's Richard
when he was ten.

40:12.965 --> 40:14.232
That's his sister.

40:15.133 --> 40:16.768
That's his parents.

40:16.802 --> 40:17.836
His parents...

40:18.971 --> 40:20.572
We only have
genetic donors.

40:20.605 --> 40:21.606
It's the same.

40:22.774 --> 40:23.976
Is it?

40:24.009 --> 40:25.610
We still get our
natures from them.

40:27.212 --> 40:28.914
Why did he show
you all this?

40:30.983 --> 40:32.584
He wanted someone
to talk to.

40:34.720 --> 40:35.887
What else?

40:35.921 --> 40:37.089
What do you mean?

40:37.122 --> 40:38.190
We saw...

40:38.223 --> 40:40.258
We saw him
touching you.

40:40.292 --> 40:41.727
And we thought that
you and Richard...

40:41.760 --> 40:42.928
I didn't do anything
with Richard.

40:43.962 --> 40:45.097
We were just friends.

40:46.798 --> 40:50.102
He showed me his things.
He would tell me about his life.

40:51.670 --> 40:52.671
But why?

40:54.039 --> 40:55.040
He felt

40:56.074 --> 40:57.075
alone.

41:01.146 --> 41:03.315
<i>Day 1,240.</i>

41:03.348 --> 41:04.916
<i>I'm not gonna be able
to keep up the count...</i>

41:06.651 --> 41:09.755
<i>It's hard to explain.
On one hand, I...</i>

41:09.788 --> 41:11.890
<i>I didn't feel like I had
anybody at home.</i>

41:12.858 --> 41:14.760
<i>The kids</i>

41:14.793 --> 41:17.963
<i>seemed like my only
relationship, so...</i>

41:17.996 --> 41:19.831
<i>I didn't want to lose that.</i>

41:19.865 --> 41:21.967
<i>And then,
on the other hand,</i>

41:22.000 --> 41:24.169
<i>I believe
it's a noble mission,</i>

41:24.202 --> 41:26.972
<i>in the great tradition
of exploration. You know...</i>

41:27.005 --> 41:28.940
<i>What's out there?
Why are we here?</i>

41:30.942 --> 41:32.010
<i>Where are we going?</i>

41:34.146 --> 41:36.248
<i>I won't get to
see the answer,</i>

41:36.281 --> 41:38.617
<i>but maybe I can move us
a little closer to it.</i>

41:40.152 --> 41:44.656
<i>But I think the real
reason why I came is,</i>

41:44.689 --> 41:46.124
<i>I wanted to make
sure they're okay.</i>

41:49.761 --> 41:50.862
<i>And I want to protect them.</i>

41:56.034 --> 41:57.269
Protect us from what?

42:38.343 --> 42:39.344
Everything okay?

42:40.245 --> 42:41.413
Yes.

42:41.446 --> 42:43.748
How's it going with
the surveillance?

42:43.782 --> 42:44.816
Not sure yet.

42:46.852 --> 42:47.953
Where is everyone?

43:01.733 --> 43:03.235
Hey, what's going on?

43:04.703 --> 43:06.204
Why isn't everyone
at their jobs?

43:07.239 --> 43:08.373
We have to repair
the damage.

43:08.406 --> 43:09.741
We have to secure
the ship.

43:10.842 --> 43:12.410
What are you
doing in here?

43:12.444 --> 43:14.346
Bit of an emergency.

43:14.379 --> 43:17.315
That short circuit cut the
power to the refrigerators.

43:17.349 --> 43:18.917
We're doing
everything we can

43:18.950 --> 43:20.285
to get them back before
we lose any food.

43:20.318 --> 43:21.686
Oh.

43:21.720 --> 43:22.754
Somebody should
have told you.

43:24.890 --> 43:27.125
- Can you fix it?
- Yes.

43:27.159 --> 43:28.193
But there's a bunch
of food we need to eat

43:28.226 --> 43:30.095
before it goes
bad and...

43:32.364 --> 43:34.099
I was thinking we
could have a party.

43:34.132 --> 43:35.200
A feast.

43:37.402 --> 43:39.171
What for?

43:39.204 --> 43:41.173
To celebrate our
new chief officer.

44:02.794 --> 44:04.963
Don't drink the blue.
Don't drink it.

44:06.097 --> 44:07.432
Why not?

44:07.465 --> 44:09.067
Zac says
we shouldn't.

44:09.100 --> 44:10.435
It's medication
to control us.

44:25.984 --> 44:27.252
- <i>Richard.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

46:25.470 --> 46:26.471
Kai!

47:19.090 --> 47:20.091
What are you doing?

47:22.327 --> 47:23.629
Get out of here now.

47:30.001 --> 47:31.369
Everyone go!

47:45.383 --> 47:46.384
Get out.

48:02.267 --> 48:03.435
Just remember,

48:04.770 --> 48:06.504
Richard isn't here
to protect you.

48:06.539 --> 48:08.173
I don't need him
to protect me.

48:15.748 --> 48:17.148
Is she all right?

48:18.617 --> 48:20.285
She doesn't want me
to touch her.

49:29.487 --> 49:30.488
Sela?

49:32.156 --> 49:33.391
You in there?

49:33.424 --> 49:34.827
Looking
for Sela?

49:34.860 --> 49:35.728
She's in the Med Bay.
I just saw her.

49:43.802 --> 49:44.803
Hi.

49:48.774 --> 49:50.241
Everything all right?

49:51.677 --> 49:53.511
Yeah.

49:54.345 --> 49:55.346
Sela?

50:01.185 --> 50:02.186
Stop.

50:03.756 --> 50:04.757
What are you doing?

50:06.825 --> 50:08.159
What does it
look like?

50:09.662 --> 50:11.262
Looks like you
got here fast.

50:18.403 --> 50:19.738
Get out.

50:19.772 --> 50:21.506
Wait.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.274
- Whoa.
- You're just like him.

50:23.308 --> 50:24.543
No, you don't
understand.

50:24.577 --> 50:25.644
He was coming in
here to get you.

50:25.678 --> 50:26.879
I was trying
to help you.

50:26.912 --> 50:28.714
Why don't you help
the rest of the crew?

50:28.747 --> 50:31.149
It's getting out of control.
You're the leader.

50:31.182 --> 50:32.283
You should do
something about it.

50:46.832 --> 50:47.866
Why'd you do that?

50:49.400 --> 50:51.369
What?

50:51.402 --> 50:52.503
You knew I was going
to find Sela,

50:52.538 --> 50:54.472
and you went
right to her.

50:54.505 --> 50:56.642
You need to
leave her alone.

50:56.675 --> 50:58.209
You think 'cause
you're chief officer,

50:58.242 --> 50:59.678
- you can tell me what to do?
- No.

50:59.712 --> 51:01.847
- Good.
- I'm telling you as a friend.

51:01.880 --> 51:03.214
Stay away from her.

51:03.247 --> 51:04.583
I'll do what I want.

51:56.401 --> 51:57.435
Kai!

51:57.468 --> 51:58.637
What are you doing, Kai?

52:27.800 --> 52:29.601
What's up?
No, I'm good.

52:32.470 --> 52:34.807
Tayo...
Tayo, get down from there.

52:34.840 --> 52:35.908
Don't sit
on the table.

52:38.309 --> 52:40.012
That's right.

52:40.045 --> 52:41.512
You're not supposed put your
feet where you're eating.

52:41.547 --> 52:43.882
Shut your face.

52:43.916 --> 52:45.617
All right.
That's enough.

52:48.754 --> 52:50.354
- Kai.
- What?

52:52.958 --> 52:54.560
No, no, no! Stop!

52:54.593 --> 52:55.728
Stop!

53:00.498 --> 53:02.433
Let go!

53:02.467 --> 53:03.969
- Let go!
- Let it go.

53:04.002 --> 53:05.537
- Let it go!
- Come on!

53:05.571 --> 53:06.672
- Let go!
- Stop!

53:32.831 --> 53:35.466
Let's get them treated.

53:35.500 --> 53:36.935
And then I want everyone
in the common room.

53:46.477 --> 53:47.813
There's no more fighting.

53:49.548 --> 53:51.516
It has to stop.

53:51.550 --> 53:53.051
It's not how we resolve
our conflicts.

53:53.919 --> 53:54.920
Do you understand?

53:58.757 --> 54:00.592
Also, some of us
aren't doing our work.

54:01.994 --> 54:03.962
No one's
maintaining the ship.

54:03.996 --> 54:06.364
Why should we if
no one else does?

54:06.397 --> 54:07.699
Because
if you don't, who will?

54:07.733 --> 54:09.601
It isn't fair.

54:09.635 --> 54:11.335
We have to repair the damage
and safeguard the ship.

54:11.369 --> 54:12.938
I want everyone
finishing those two jobs.

54:12.971 --> 54:14.338
The ship
is secure.

54:15.140 --> 54:16.708
We've done
our job.

54:16.742 --> 54:19.545
Then everyone should
be in the systems room.

54:19.578 --> 54:21.980
No. Now we're working
on the food supply.

54:22.014 --> 54:23.549
This is more important.

54:23.582 --> 54:24.883
More important
than food?

54:26.652 --> 54:28.887
No, you're wrong
about that.

54:28.921 --> 54:31.023
You haven't been working
on the food anyway.

54:31.056 --> 54:32.724
You haven't been
doing anything.

54:33.725 --> 54:35.127
No one has.

54:35.160 --> 54:36.929
And if we don't,
the mission won't survive.

54:36.962 --> 54:38.831
Who cares?

54:38.864 --> 54:39.932
We won't make
it anyway.

54:39.965 --> 54:41.033
But somebody will.

54:42.734 --> 54:44.468
And it's our job
to support them.

54:44.502 --> 54:45.571
To lay the groundwork.

54:45.604 --> 54:46.939
For our grandchildren.

54:46.972 --> 54:49.507
Who cares about them?
We'll be dead.

54:49.541 --> 54:51.877
Listen, we're going to get that
whole section up and running,

54:51.910 --> 54:53.612
and everyone's going
to work on it.

54:53.645 --> 54:55.047
I don't want to work
in the systems room.

54:55.080 --> 54:58.050
- Why not?
- I just don't.

54:58.083 --> 55:00.552
He thinks the alien
is living in there.

55:00.586 --> 55:02.154
What? That doesn't
make any sense.

55:02.187 --> 55:03.889
It's on
the outside.

55:03.922 --> 55:05.489
He says we brought it
inside with Richard.

55:06.825 --> 55:08.794
Christopher
brought it in.

55:08.827 --> 55:10.394
Now it's hiding in
the damaged area.

55:11.597 --> 55:13.131
That's not true.

55:13.165 --> 55:15.033
I, for one,
don't know if there is an alien.

55:15.067 --> 55:16.802
Who cares what
you don't know?

55:16.835 --> 55:18.170
If we repair
the damage,

55:18.203 --> 55:19.738
we can watch the
surveillance video and see...

55:19.771 --> 55:22.841
Shut your fat,
pus-filled face.

55:22.875 --> 55:24.643
I've got
a right to talk.

55:24.676 --> 55:26.812
You talk too much as it is,
you bloated, wheezing blister.

55:26.845 --> 55:28.847
Zac, she can talk.

55:28.881 --> 55:30.782
You shut up, too.

55:30.816 --> 55:33.417
Who are you?
Telling people what to do.

55:33.451 --> 55:34.686
I'm chief officer.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.921
Why should that make
any difference?

55:35.954 --> 55:37.155
Because I was chosen.

55:37.189 --> 55:39.157
It's in the program.
It's in the rules.

55:39.191 --> 55:40.759
Who cares about
the rules?

55:40.792 --> 55:42.426
Zac! Come on.

55:42.460 --> 55:44.763
We're strong,
we can do what we want.

55:47.599 --> 55:49.568
Stop it!
Both of you. Stop!

55:49.601 --> 55:51.036
I'm not listening to
Christopher anymore.

55:51.069 --> 55:52.204
He's chief officer.

55:52.237 --> 55:53.705
You're not
a commander.

55:55.540 --> 55:57.743
- You're not a leader.
- I'm trying to keep us on track.

55:57.776 --> 55:59.745
Anyone who wants
to follow me can.

56:01.146 --> 56:03.481
- I'll make more food.
- That's our food, too.

56:03.514 --> 56:04.816
And I'll protect you
from the alien.

56:04.850 --> 56:05.918
Especially if he's
inside the ship now.

56:05.951 --> 56:07.418
You're just trying
to scare them.

56:10.622 --> 56:11.823
Are you calling
me a liar?

56:15.060 --> 56:16.527
Zac, why are you
doing this?

56:20.999 --> 56:22.100
We need a new leader.

56:24.736 --> 56:26.171
He doesn't know
how to feed you.

56:27.806 --> 56:30.242
He can't protect you.

56:30.275 --> 56:32.144
And I'm not going to
listen to him anymore.

56:35.714 --> 56:39.051
Anyone who wants to be a
part of my group is welcome.

56:41.753 --> 56:44.156
We'll have more food,
so we're strong...

56:44.189 --> 56:46.925
Strong enough to fight
the alien, strong enough

56:48.126 --> 56:49.460
to kill it.

57:00.305 --> 57:01.540
Anyone who wants

57:03.141 --> 57:04.142
can come with me.

57:21.259 --> 57:23.128
What if Zac is right
about the alien?

57:43.582 --> 57:45.050
If we can just
get that surveillance drive,

57:45.083 --> 57:46.651
then we can see what
really happened.

57:48.020 --> 57:50.155
You don't think it's living in
there, do you?

57:51.256 --> 57:52.591
I don't know.

58:30.929 --> 58:31.997
What are you doing?

58:32.931 --> 58:34.299
Nothing.

58:34.332 --> 58:35.567
Where's Christopher?

58:36.401 --> 58:37.636
I... I don't know.

58:40.839 --> 58:41.873
Who's in the
systems room?

58:41.907 --> 58:42.941
No one.

58:48.647 --> 58:50.248
You all stay here.

58:50.282 --> 58:51.783
Don't let anyone
come in.

59:19.744 --> 59:20.846
What do you think?

59:24.349 --> 59:25.383
What's through there?

59:48.106 --> 59:49.274
What is that?

59:51.076 --> 59:52.744
- Get behind it.
- Try to close the door.

59:54.012 --> 59:58.183
Go! Go! Go!

01:00:00.385 --> 01:00:02.154
Close it! Close it!

01:00:02.187 --> 01:00:04.322
What was that?
What happened?

01:00:04.356 --> 01:00:06.024
What was it?

01:00:14.432 --> 01:00:17.002
The surveillance drive.

01:00:17.035 --> 01:00:20.005
- There was really something in there?
- What was it?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.009
- I don't know.
- Not Christopher?

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:25.443
- No.
- What did it look like?

01:00:26.778 --> 01:00:28.880
It was dark.
We couldn't see.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.721
Okay...

01:00:42.994 --> 01:00:44.930
<i>Start shutting down
the transmitter circuits now.</i>

01:00:44.963 --> 01:00:46.131
It's pretty damaged.

01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:47.899
You can't
see anything.

01:00:47.933 --> 01:00:49.201
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Let's try a different angle.

01:00:56.441 --> 01:00:58.143
I can clean this up.

01:00:58.176 --> 01:00:59.411
It's not as bad as it looks.

01:01:03.949 --> 01:01:04.983
Everything all right?

01:01:05.016 --> 01:01:06.418
No.

01:01:07.118 --> 01:01:09.087
What is it?

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.989
Zac and Kai were in the systems
room right after you left.

01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:13.858
They said they
saw the alien.

01:01:13.892 --> 01:01:15.393
- They fought it.
- What?

01:01:15.427 --> 01:01:16.861
It wasn't there
when I was inside.

01:01:16.895 --> 01:01:18.763
And the room
looks destroyed.

01:01:18.797 --> 01:01:20.098
There are pieces of the
surveillance unit everywhere.

01:01:21.567 --> 01:01:23.902
The alien did that?

01:01:23.935 --> 01:01:25.136
Or they did it
themselves.

01:01:29.274 --> 01:01:30.475
It doesn't matter.

01:01:30.508 --> 01:01:31.743
We have all the
data right here.

01:01:33.845 --> 01:01:35.013
But if it was
Zac and Kai,

01:01:35.046 --> 01:01:36.214
they did it
for a reason.

01:01:40.318 --> 01:01:41.786
To destroy the record.

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.441
<i>Who's with him?</i>

01:02:03.475 --> 01:02:05.477
<i>Christopher.</i>

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:07.846
<i>It was supposed
to be me.</i>

01:02:07.879 --> 01:02:09.147
<i>Richard looked for you.</i>

01:02:12.117 --> 01:02:14.019
<i>All right,
go into LCT 2.</i>

01:02:14.052 --> 01:02:16.221
<i>Copy that.
Shutting down LCT 2.</i>

01:02:20.158 --> 01:02:22.127
<i>You should give him a
little zap for his trouble.</i>

01:02:23.562 --> 01:02:25.163
<i>For my trouble...</i>

01:02:26.965 --> 01:02:28.266
<i>A little spark.</i>

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.834
- <i>A sting?</i>
- <i>A stab.</i>

01:02:37.175 --> 01:02:38.943
<i>You could do it.</i>

01:02:38.977 --> 01:02:41.212
- <i>I know I could.</i>
- <i>He'd be surprised.</i>

01:02:42.347 --> 01:02:44.449
<i>He'd be shocked.</i>

01:02:49.521 --> 01:02:50.822
<i>You hear that?</i>

01:02:52.924 --> 01:02:54.926
<i>Yeah, it's just
the ship.</i>

01:02:54.959 --> 01:02:56.461
He knew it
was the ship all along.

01:02:59.264 --> 01:03:00.265
<i>This one?</i>

01:03:01.099 --> 01:03:02.233
<i>Yes.</i>

01:03:06.438 --> 01:03:07.606
<i>He didn't feel it.</i>

01:03:12.077 --> 01:03:13.411
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:03:13.445 --> 01:03:15.013
<i>Is he touching the cable?</i>

01:03:15.046 --> 01:03:17.248
<i>Yes. But his gloves
are insulated.</i>

01:03:30.663 --> 01:03:31.863
Murder...

01:03:42.307 --> 01:03:44.577
Don't mention
this to anyone.

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:46.244
Not until we decide what to do.

01:03:51.416 --> 01:03:52.618
How could Zac do that?

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.555
Why have they
all gone crazy?

01:03:58.256 --> 01:03:59.424
Maybe they haven't.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.461
Maybe this is what
they're really like.

01:04:05.063 --> 01:04:06.931
We have our rules
that keep us in line,

01:04:09.602 --> 01:04:11.503
but deep down,
maybe this is our true nature.

01:04:13.505 --> 01:04:14.506
No.

01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:18.644
It can't be.
I'm not like that.

01:04:19.645 --> 01:04:21.146
You're not like that.

01:04:23.014 --> 01:04:24.015
You're not.

01:04:26.518 --> 01:04:30.188
And the crew will be on our
side once they know the truth.

01:04:31.156 --> 01:04:32.223
I'm not so sure.

01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:34.593
They don't care anymore.

01:04:38.631 --> 01:04:40.064
Sometimes,
I don't either.

01:04:40.766 --> 01:04:41.966
You care.

01:04:44.068 --> 01:04:45.069
I know you do.

01:04:49.174 --> 01:04:50.375
I should leave
you alone.

01:04:53.378 --> 01:04:54.412
No.

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.083
I want you to stay.

01:06:30.241 --> 01:06:31.544
Time to
wake up, Sela.

01:06:40.451 --> 01:06:41.620
Go away!

01:06:44.355 --> 01:06:46.491
Oh, we're not going away.
We're coming in.

01:06:59.872 --> 01:07:02.173
What are you doing?

01:07:02.206 --> 01:07:03.308
What are
you doing?

01:07:04.877 --> 01:07:07.278
I see I'm breaking up a
nice little thing here.

01:07:07.312 --> 01:07:08.681
What do you want?

01:07:08.714 --> 01:07:10.415
We're having
a celebration.

01:07:10.448 --> 01:07:11.650
Right now?

01:07:11.684 --> 01:07:13.151
Yes.

01:07:13.184 --> 01:07:14.185
Sela's invited.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.288
I guess you
are, too.

01:07:17.322 --> 01:07:18.724
Come eat.
If you want.

01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:21.459
Don't if you don't.

01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:51.590
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:07:53.759 --> 01:07:54.760
Get some food.

01:07:55.794 --> 01:07:56.795
You must be hungry.

01:08:11.877 --> 01:08:13.344
All right, listen up,
everybody.

01:08:17.549 --> 01:08:21.419
Now I know we've had some
disagreements in the past.

01:08:21.452 --> 01:08:22.821
We're going to put
all that behind us.

01:08:24.488 --> 01:08:25.591
I'm chief officer now,

01:08:27.325 --> 01:08:28.426
and that's the way
it's gonna be.

01:08:30.629 --> 01:08:32.731
From now on,
we'll do the work,

01:08:32.765 --> 01:08:35.734
but we'll do it when we
want and how we want.

01:08:38.569 --> 01:08:39.837
We'll make the rules,

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:43.709
and anyone who breaks them

01:08:43.742 --> 01:08:45.176
will have to answer to me.

01:08:46.511 --> 01:08:48.913
The alien's somewhere
in the ship.

01:08:48.947 --> 01:08:52.383
We'll fight it again if we have
to, and we'll defeat it.

01:08:52.417 --> 01:08:54.752
You'll be safe now
'cause I'll protect you.

01:08:58.488 --> 01:09:00.859
Hey, what are you doing?

01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:02.861
Sit down.

01:09:05.997 --> 01:09:07.700
Richard was killed

01:09:07.733 --> 01:09:09.868
at 13:58:37.

01:09:09.902 --> 01:09:12.437
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- He was electrocuted.

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:14.907
<i>Shutting down LCT 1.</i>

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:16.240
<i>Who's with him?</i>

01:09:17.341 --> 01:09:18.544
<i>Christopher.</i>

01:09:18.577 --> 01:09:20.679
<i>It was supposed to be me.</i>

01:09:20.712 --> 01:09:22.915
<i>You should give him a
little zap for his trouble.</i>

01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:24.850
<i>A little spark.</i>

01:09:24.883 --> 01:09:25.984
- <i>A sting?</i>
- <i>A stab.</i>

01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:29.353
- <i>This one?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:09:29.386 --> 01:09:30.622
<i>He didn't feel it.</i>

01:09:30.656 --> 01:09:31.990
<i>Is he touching
the cable?</i>

01:09:32.024 --> 01:09:33.692
<i>Yes,
but his gloves are insulated.</i>

01:09:40.532 --> 01:09:42.332
Zac killed Richard.

01:09:43.736 --> 01:09:45.470
There is no alien.

01:09:45.502 --> 01:09:48.607
Not out there, not in here.
There's only Zac.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.576
He's been lying to you
the whole time.

01:09:53.078 --> 01:09:54.580
But now you
know the truth.

01:09:55.914 --> 01:09:59.383
You've seen it
with your own eyes.

01:09:59.417 --> 01:10:02.855
Zac should go to his compartment
while we consult the program.

01:10:02.888 --> 01:10:04.590
Then we'll decide
what to do.

01:10:13.632 --> 01:10:14.633
It's true.

01:10:15.567 --> 01:10:16.568
I did it.

01:10:19.805 --> 01:10:21.006
I killed him.

01:10:25.978 --> 01:10:28.714
But I did it for you.

01:10:31.016 --> 01:10:33.384
I did it to protect you.

01:10:33.417 --> 01:10:37.756
I did it because I saw
the alien in him.

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.793
The alien was in Richard,

01:10:40.826 --> 01:10:42.426
and then Christopher
brought it inside.

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:43.595
That's not true.

01:10:43.629 --> 01:10:45.463
He shouldn't have.

01:10:45.496 --> 01:10:47.800
He knew something was
wrong, but he did it anyway.

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:51.103
He brought the alien
into the ship.

01:10:51.136 --> 01:10:53.005
Just watch the rest
of the video.

01:10:53.038 --> 01:10:54.540
You'll see he's lying.

01:10:54.573 --> 01:10:56.340
I killed Richard
to protect the crew,

01:10:56.374 --> 01:10:58.844
but now the alien's inside
the ship somewhere.

01:10:58.877 --> 01:11:00.979
We need to find out
where so we can stop it.

01:11:01.013 --> 01:11:02.346
So we can kill it.

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.683
That's right.
We'll kill it.

01:11:04.716 --> 01:11:06.484
We'll take
back control.

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:09.822
We've been drugged and betrayed
and programmed by liars,

01:11:09.855 --> 01:11:12.591
but we're not going to
follow the program anymore.

01:11:14.092 --> 01:11:16.360
We can't escape this life,

01:11:16.394 --> 01:11:18.664
but we won't just lay
down and give up.

01:11:18.697 --> 01:11:20.431
We won't be afraid.

01:11:20.464 --> 01:11:21.800
We won't be terrorized.

01:11:21.834 --> 01:11:23.367
We'll fight back,
we'll find it!

01:11:23.401 --> 01:11:24.435
There's nothing
to find.

01:11:24.468 --> 01:11:25.503
Where is it now?

01:11:27.438 --> 01:11:28.807
First,

01:11:28.841 --> 01:11:30.042
it was inside Richard.

01:11:33.045 --> 01:11:34.813
Now maybe it's hiding
in someone else.

01:11:37.049 --> 01:11:38.449
One of you.

01:11:40.552 --> 01:11:41.553
It could be you.

01:11:47.626 --> 01:11:48.627
Or you.

01:11:52.865 --> 01:11:53.866
Or you.

01:11:55.667 --> 01:11:56.902
We'll kill it.

01:11:56.935 --> 01:11:59.805
Yes. We'll find it
and kill it.

01:11:59.838 --> 01:12:01.773
- Kill it.
- We have to find it.

01:12:01.807 --> 01:12:03.675
- It could be you.
- Or you.

01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:04.710
Or you.

01:12:11.116 --> 01:12:12.117
Or him.

01:12:14.853 --> 01:12:16.788
It's him.

01:12:16.822 --> 01:12:18.957
- It's him!
- Him...

01:12:18.991 --> 01:12:20.759
It's him!

01:12:20.792 --> 01:12:22.194
It's him.

01:12:22.227 --> 01:12:23.695
Him.

01:12:25.197 --> 01:12:26.732
Get him!

01:12:51.857 --> 01:12:52.858
Stop! Stop it!

01:13:37.803 --> 01:13:39.104
It's okay.

01:13:39.137 --> 01:13:41.707
He had the alien
inside of him.

01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:45.210
- I don't know.
- He did.

01:13:46.144 --> 01:13:47.145
Don't worry.

01:13:50.315 --> 01:13:52.918
Unless it's you
who has it inside.

01:13:54.853 --> 01:13:55.854
No.

01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:58.190
It's not me.

01:14:00.993 --> 01:14:02.861
Grab anything that can
be used as a weapon.

01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:08.533
Scalpels, scissors,
anything sharp.

01:14:08.567 --> 01:14:11.303
We have to arm
ourselves to fight.

01:14:11.336 --> 01:14:13.105
We need something that
will make him back down.

01:14:14.306 --> 01:14:16.575
Maybe we should
just give up.

01:14:16.608 --> 01:14:17.809
We can't give up.

01:14:17.843 --> 01:14:19.778
But there's nothing
we can do right now.

01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:21.813
We accused him of murder.
He's not going to forget that.

01:14:21.847 --> 01:14:23.915
We should join
his group.

01:14:23.949 --> 01:14:25.217
I mean, that's all he
really wants anyway.

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:26.685
Maybe later
we can detain him.

01:14:26.718 --> 01:14:27.886
That's right.

01:14:27.919 --> 01:14:29.788
When things calm down.

01:14:29.821 --> 01:14:31.990
Eventually,
things will calm down and be okay.

01:14:32.024 --> 01:14:34.259
Right now,
it is too dangerous.

01:14:34.292 --> 01:14:35.894
We can't
stay separate.

01:14:35.927 --> 01:14:37.029
There's no way
to fight him.

01:14:37.062 --> 01:14:38.063
We don't have
any weapons.

01:14:40.832 --> 01:14:41.833
Weapons.

01:14:45.937 --> 01:14:47.806
You know where they are.

01:14:47.839 --> 01:14:49.207
I do?

01:14:49.241 --> 01:14:50.275
He said you did.

01:14:50.308 --> 01:14:52.811
- Who did?
- Richard.

01:14:52.844 --> 01:14:56.181
I was watching his video diary,
and he said you knew about the weapons.

01:17:32.103 --> 01:17:33.104
Chief.

01:17:34.839 --> 01:17:35.840
Wake up.

01:18:24.889 --> 01:18:26.124
Was it the alien?

01:18:27.926 --> 01:18:28.960
It was Christopher.

01:19:17.108 --> 01:19:19.511
Must be for the third
generation.

01:19:19.545 --> 01:19:20.979
When they reach
the planet.

01:19:24.015 --> 01:19:25.016
No, these are for us.

01:19:51.943 --> 01:19:52.944
Chief.

01:20:00.586 --> 01:20:02.120
They want
to join us.

01:20:05.924 --> 01:20:07.258
Why should
we let you?

01:20:08.493 --> 01:20:10.395
What else
can we do?

01:20:10.428 --> 01:20:12.097
Is the alien
inside you?

01:20:12.130 --> 01:20:13.264
There isn't an...

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.101
No. It's not.

01:20:18.403 --> 01:20:19.904
Where're they hiding?

01:20:22.641 --> 01:20:24.476
There they are.

01:20:24.509 --> 01:20:25.944
What are they holding?

01:20:27.145 --> 01:20:28.146
Weapons.

01:20:29.548 --> 01:20:31.916
And we just
have this.

01:20:34.219 --> 01:20:35.621
That's not going
to help us.

01:20:35.654 --> 01:20:37.021
Maybe it will.

01:20:39.491 --> 01:20:41.126
We can say we want
to join his group.

01:20:42.561 --> 01:20:43.928
Like Anda and Alex.

01:20:43.962 --> 01:20:45.196
He'll never believe it.

01:20:45.230 --> 01:20:46.331
All we need is a moment.

01:20:47.198 --> 01:20:48.199
Why?

01:20:49.968 --> 01:20:51.604
So we can get close.

01:20:51.637 --> 01:20:53.138
And then what?

01:20:57.442 --> 01:20:58.644
And then I'll kill him.

01:20:59.978 --> 01:21:01.312
Kill him?

01:21:01.346 --> 01:21:02.615
Or he's going to kill us.

01:21:02.648 --> 01:21:05.049
- No, he's not.
- They're moving.

01:21:29.708 --> 01:21:31.443
They cut
the power.

01:21:31.476 --> 01:21:33.646
- What do we do?
- We stay in here.

01:21:33.679 --> 01:21:35.180
No.

01:21:35.213 --> 01:21:37.282
We should go out there,
talk to them.

01:21:37.315 --> 01:21:39.117
Tell them we don't want
to fight. And then...

01:21:41.787 --> 01:21:43.188
They're here.

01:21:52.397 --> 01:21:54.332
Don't do anything.

01:21:54.365 --> 01:21:56.067
Don't resist.

01:22:17.656 --> 01:22:19.057
Grab him.

01:22:20.559 --> 01:22:21.560
Get off me!

01:22:22.595 --> 01:22:23.729
This way.

01:22:27.465 --> 01:22:28.801
Wait!

01:22:28.834 --> 01:22:30.034
Wait a minute!

01:22:32.337 --> 01:22:33.505
Get back, Sela!

01:22:37.509 --> 01:22:38.510
Zac.

01:22:39.545 --> 01:22:41.179
You can't stop us.

01:22:41.212 --> 01:22:42.347
Let me talk to you.

01:22:43.816 --> 01:22:45.450
What for?

01:22:45.483 --> 01:22:46.552
Privately.

01:22:49.087 --> 01:22:51.724
You can say whatever
you want to say right here.

01:22:55.728 --> 01:22:57.262
I want to be with you.

01:23:00.398 --> 01:23:01.634
You want
to join my group,

01:23:02.635 --> 01:23:04.302
or you want
to be with me?

01:23:05.403 --> 01:23:06.404
Both.

01:23:08.273 --> 01:23:09.374
I bet you do.

01:23:10.108 --> 01:23:11.109
I do.

01:23:13.177 --> 01:23:15.146
I'm glad you've finally
come to your senses.

01:23:16.114 --> 01:23:17.181
I have.

01:23:20.251 --> 01:23:22.253
I'll do anything
you want.

01:23:22.287 --> 01:23:23.454
I'm sure you will.

01:23:27.593 --> 01:23:29.160
Only problem...

01:23:32.263 --> 01:23:33.599
...is I don't
want you to.

01:23:35.901 --> 01:23:37.570
You want to be with me,

01:23:39.170 --> 01:23:41.406
but I don't want
to be with you.

01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:47.278
Maybe someone else does.

01:23:48.479 --> 01:23:50.248
But not me.

01:23:50.281 --> 01:23:52.751
Have you
all gone crazy?

01:23:54.687 --> 01:23:56.087
Have you?

01:23:56.889 --> 01:23:58.323
Don't you see?

01:23:58.356 --> 01:24:00.693
All of this is
against our nature.

01:24:00.726 --> 01:24:02.360
This is not
who we are.

01:24:02.393 --> 01:24:05.363
This is who
we are.

01:24:05.396 --> 01:24:07.098
But we don't have
to act this way.

01:24:07.666 --> 01:24:09.133
We can think.

01:24:09.167 --> 01:24:10.603
We can decide
to be different.

01:24:10.636 --> 01:24:12.871
Shut up,
you genetic defect.

01:24:12.905 --> 01:24:15.506
We can decide
which is better.

01:24:15.541 --> 01:24:16.709
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

01:24:16.742 --> 01:24:18.711
Let me speak!

01:24:18.744 --> 01:24:22.213
We're trying to make sense
here, and you're not listening.

01:24:22.246 --> 01:24:23.348
Shut up.

01:24:23.381 --> 01:24:24.783
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

01:24:24.817 --> 01:24:26.250
Shut up.
Shut up.

01:24:26.284 --> 01:24:27.553
Which is better?

01:24:27.586 --> 01:24:30.421
To have rules
and agree, or...

01:24:30.455 --> 01:24:32.423
Or to run wild
and fight?

01:24:32.457 --> 01:24:35.193
To run wild.

01:24:35.226 --> 01:24:38.463
Do you want to listen to
reason and figure out a plan,

01:24:38.496 --> 01:24:40.532
or do you want to...

01:25:18.469 --> 01:25:19.538
You see?

01:25:21.506 --> 01:25:22.741
You see what I can do?

01:25:44.763 --> 01:25:45.931
Which way?

01:25:45.964 --> 01:25:47.533
You go that way.
I'll check down here.

01:25:56.608 --> 01:25:57.609
This way.

01:26:24.636 --> 01:26:26.905
Check in the vats.
Check in the refrigerators.

01:26:35.313 --> 01:26:36.447
Tayo.

01:26:36.481 --> 01:26:37.482
Check in there.

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.788
No way they
could fit.

01:26:42.821 --> 01:26:43.989
Check all of them.

01:26:51.897 --> 01:26:52.998
This one's been opened.

01:27:01.106 --> 01:27:02.406
Move back, Tayo.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.842
- What?
- Get out of the way.

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:23.061
Zac, that's
for our food.

01:27:27.398 --> 01:27:28.466
Go see if
we got them.

01:27:55.694 --> 01:27:56.929
We should stay...

01:27:58.496 --> 01:28:00.732
Check the drawers,
try to find something.

01:28:06.504 --> 01:28:08.874
Next to you,
in the cabinet.

01:28:35.133 --> 01:28:36.467
They're in
the Med Bay.

01:28:57.823 --> 01:28:58.824
Hey!

01:29:07.032 --> 01:29:08.634
You're okay.
You're okay.

01:30:17.269 --> 01:30:18.870
Get into a space suit.

01:30:18.904 --> 01:30:20.605
If we go out,
we'll never get back in.

01:31:33.278 --> 01:31:35.147
<i>Close hatch.</i>

01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.181
<i>Close hatch.</i>

01:31:37.182 --> 01:31:39.117
<i>Close hatch.</i>

01:31:39.151 --> 01:31:40.886
<i>Emergency oxygen released.</i>

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:49.628
<i>Enter closing code.</i>

01:31:56.301 --> 01:31:57.803
<i>Hatch closing.</i>

01:32:02.808 --> 01:32:05.177
<i>Oxygen level 70%.</i>

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.849
<i>Oxygen level 50%.</i>

01:32:20.325 --> 01:32:23.061
- <i>Oxygen level 30%.</i>
- No!

01:32:42.114 --> 01:32:43.315
<i>Pressurize now.</i>

01:32:44.683 --> 01:32:46.017
<i>Pressurize now.</i>

01:32:59.698 --> 01:33:01.233
<i>Hatch stopped.</i>

01:34:09.201 --> 01:34:10.202
Tayo.

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:16.208
Put your guns down.

01:34:17.375 --> 01:34:18.376
Zac's gone.

01:34:53.311 --> 01:34:55.213
How do we make sure
it doesn't happen again?

01:35:07.359 --> 01:35:09.127
<i>So tomorrow we go.</i>

01:35:10.996 --> 01:35:12.430
<i>And as we begin our journey,</i>

01:35:12.464 --> 01:35:15.800
<i>I think about the world
we are leaving behind.</i>

01:35:15.834 --> 01:35:18.169
<i>And how I've seen it
at its best and its worst</i>

01:35:19.404 --> 01:35:20.438
<i>and how</i>

01:35:22.107 --> 01:35:24.075
<i>we'll have our own bad times.</i>

01:35:24.109 --> 01:35:25.977
<i>I mean, they're coming.
There is nothing I can do about it.</i>

01:35:27.512 --> 01:35:29.447
<i>But I also know that
you will prevail.</i>

01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:33.118
<i>And our best will live on.</i>

01:35:36.221 --> 01:35:37.522
<i>That we are worth saving.</i>

01:35:52.103 --> 01:35:56.007
And the new Chief is...
Sela.

01:35:56.041 --> 01:35:57.576
We are voting
on everything now.

01:35:57.610 --> 01:35:59.110
Trying to reach consensus.

01:36:01.313 --> 01:36:04.983
It's not easy, but it's how
we want to move forward.

01:36:05.016 --> 01:36:08.186
And we've decided
to not go back on the blue.

01:36:10.155 --> 01:36:11.923
We feel that it is the
best course of action.

01:36:11.956 --> 01:36:13.325
That we can do better.

01:36:27.906 --> 01:36:30.075
Hey, Chief,
we just started those updates.

01:36:41.319 --> 01:36:42.588
Still been
having headaches?

01:36:43.689 --> 01:36:44.989
She just kicked.

01:39:32.638 --> 01:39:37.638
