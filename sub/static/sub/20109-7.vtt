WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.836
All right, Morty,
you ready for our adventure

00:03.871 --> 00:05.206
to the Lost City of Atlantis?

00:05.239 --> 00:06.474
Ready as I'll ever be, Rick.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.509
Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.711
Hello, I'm Rick K-22.
This is my Morty.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.746
We're going from
reality to reality

00:12.780 --> 00:14.182
asking Ricks to contribute

00:14.215 --> 00:17.051
to the Citadel of Ricks
Redevelopment Fund.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.319
What are you, stupid?

00:18.352 --> 00:19.753
We're done with
the Citadel of Ricks.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.489
I was never on board
with it in the first place.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.191
That's why
I murdered everyone in charge

00:23.224 --> 00:24.224
and left it to rot.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.026
Oh, that was you.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.862
They tried
to murder him first.
Aw, geez.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.364
Well, you'll be happy to know

00:30.398 --> 00:31.699
that the council's gone now...

00:31.732 --> 00:33.201
Yeah, he knows.
He murdered them.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.403
You want to rein in
your Morty?
Every day.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.037
The Citadel of Ricks
Redevelopment Fund

00:37.071 --> 00:39.440
donates...
Morty, he's not gonna
donate.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.175
You're pitching
the Policeman's Ball

00:41.209 --> 00:42.576
to a black teenager here.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.545
Let's go.
You don't have to be
a dick.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.514
I think you know
that's not true.
Geez.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.116
I didn't know there were
still Ricks and Mortys

00:48.149 --> 00:49.550
living on the Citadel.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.718
I wonder what their
day-to-day lives are like.

00:50.751 --> 00:51.885
Well, you can keep
wondering that

00:51.919 --> 00:53.221
while we go on a fun, fresh,

00:53.254 --> 00:54.788
self-contained adventure
to Atlantis.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.591
Anyone continuing to
explore the Citadel
is either stupid

00:57.625 --> 00:59.360
or one of
the unfortunate millions

00:59.393 --> 01:01.229
held hostage
by their terrible ideas.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.497
Man, I'm glad
I'm not one of them!

01:04.665 --> 01:08.769
* Somewhere out on
that horizon *

01:10.438 --> 01:14.675
* Out beyond the neon lights

01:16.344 --> 01:20.848
* I know there must be
somethin' better *

01:22.616 --> 01:26.954
* But there's nowhere else
in sight *

01:28.822 --> 01:32.460
* It's survival in the city

01:34.695 --> 01:38.132
* When you live
from day to day *

01:40.634 --> 01:44.138
* City streets
don't have much pity *

01:46.974 --> 01:50.444
* When you're down,
that's where you'll stay *

01:50.478 --> 01:51.745
**

01:51.779 --> 01:53.013
Announcer Rick:
Citadel Morning News.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.448
News about the Citadel
in the morning,

01:54.482 --> 01:55.783
pretty self explanatory.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.851
Good morning.
I'm Rick D-716B.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.188
And I'm Rick D-716.
Must be nice.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.790
Coming up, gravity outages
in East Sanchez Heights...

02:02.823 --> 02:05.092
And, is your uranium-powered
cellular matrix

02:05.125 --> 02:06.125
making you sick?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.828
The answer may not surprise you.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.697
It's...
Yes, it's uranium.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.965
Those stories and more,
after this break.

02:11.999 --> 02:15.503
Sam Elliot: 60 iterations
off the central finite curve,

02:15.536 --> 02:17.471
there's a Rick
that works more with wood

02:17.505 --> 02:19.039
than polarity plating.

02:19.072 --> 02:22.443
His name is Simple Rick
but he's no dummy.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.877
He realized long ago

02:23.911 --> 02:26.113
that the greatest thing
he'd ever create

02:26.146 --> 02:27.315
was his daughter.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.616
I love Daddy!

02:28.649 --> 02:30.129
Sam Elliot:
We captured that moment...

02:30.150 --> 02:32.152
We run it on a loop
through Simple Rick's mind...

02:32.186 --> 02:34.188
And the chemical
it makes his brain secrete

02:34.222 --> 02:37.658
goes into every Simple Rick's
"Simple Wafers" Wafer Cookie.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.560
Come home to
the impossible flavor

02:39.593 --> 02:41.195
of your own completion.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.197
Come home to Simple Rick's.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.365
Just one day remains

02:44.398 --> 02:46.300
before our
newly democratic Citadel

02:46.334 --> 02:47.668
elects its first President,

02:47.701 --> 02:50.003
it's anyone's race
among the Rick candidates.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.472
But a certain other candidate

02:51.505 --> 02:52.740
should be getting
at least one vote

02:52.773 --> 02:54.342
for most adorable.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.809
That's right.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.077
The Morty party candidate's
still in the race,

02:57.110 --> 02:59.012
and you just gotta
love him for that.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.382
Here you see him in his little
Morty suit waving...

03:01.415 --> 03:03.083
Isn't that adorable?
Little jackass.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.685
Uh, yeah,
I think we actually have

03:04.718 --> 03:06.019
the audio for his speech here...

03:06.053 --> 03:07.655
Aw, geez. Aw, man.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.189
I'm gonna lose the election
and stuff.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.693
We had a good run, sir,

03:12.726 --> 03:14.662
but I think it's time
to pull out of the race.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.764
I feel pretty confident
about tonight's debate.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.533
You shouldn't, sir.
You should be terrified.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.602
Maybe you should find
a little faith, young man.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.238
You don't pay me to have faith.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.939
And we're the same age!

03:33.213 --> 03:34.648
- Aah!
- Whoa!

03:36.617 --> 03:38.586
Oh. Sorry.
I-I was expecting...

03:38.619 --> 03:39.953
A Rick partner?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.955
Lesson one, rookie,
expect the unexpected.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.056
Now, get in.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.894
Mortys are human!

03:46.927 --> 03:49.297
Get the fuck off the car,
you Rickless fuckin' animal!

03:49.330 --> 03:51.565
Whoa!
Morty Cop: The election's
got these yellow shirts

03:51.599 --> 03:53.601
more riled up than
a picture-day Jessica.

03:53.634 --> 03:54.902
That's pretty harsh, sir.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.637
So report me.
Nobody gives a fuck.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.706
Look, I'm just saying,
it makes me a little sad

03:58.739 --> 04:00.419
to hear a Morty cop
calling Mortys animals.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.241
Well, it makes me sad to hear
another Rick cop

04:02.242 --> 04:03.744
buying into his
sensitivity training.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.497
Well, I'm glad to know
there's more like me.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.147
Oh, there was one.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.049
Why do you think that seat
was empty?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.652
Rick Dispatch: Robbery at Fifth
and Avenue.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.986
Fifth and

04:13.020 --> 04:14.722
That's Morty Town.
Unit seven responding.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.255
Ohh!

04:18.459 --> 04:19.892
Rick Teacher:
Good idea, Rick.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.428
All Morty Students:
Good idea, Rick.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.996
This is a great adventure.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.965
All:
This is a great adventure.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.100
I love being your new Morty.

04:27.134 --> 04:30.170
All: I love being
your new Mor...
Farty.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.105
Very amusing, Mr. Smith.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.608
Almost as amusing as
when your first Rick

04:34.642 --> 04:36.644
was decapitated on
Zorpantheon Nine.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.011
Or was that your third Rick?

04:38.045 --> 04:39.613
How many Ricks have you had?

04:39.647 --> 04:40.948
Five.
I see.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.784
So you are top of the class
in something.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.019
Tomorrow you'll be transferred
to your new Ricks.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.121
Hopefully
they will be your last.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.123
Yes, Slow Ri...
Tall Morty?

04:50.157 --> 04:52.926
Di... did I gradgitate
this time yet?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.795
Anything's possible, Tall Morty.

04:58.499 --> 05:01.134
I guess we won't be seeing
each other after this, huh?

05:01.168 --> 05:03.203
I say we make
our last day count.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.773
I say... we go to
the Wishing Portal.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.441
That's a myth.
It's not a myth.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.676
My first Rick's fourth Morty

05:08.709 --> 05:10.310
knew a Rick
whose Morty went there.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.012
If we're not here
for graduation,

05:12.045 --> 05:14.047
our butts are gonna wind up
in Morty Town.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.484
I thought your last Rick
fused you with a lizard,

05:16.517 --> 05:17.518
not a chicken.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.152
Okay, fine. I'm in.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.354
Me too.

05:20.854 --> 05:24.091
What the hell?!
I thought I saw a fly.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.734
Supervisor Rick:

05:33.767 --> 05:35.035
Listen up, fuck nuts.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.904
I've been your supervisor
for five years,

05:36.937 --> 05:39.006
but all shitty things
must come to an end

05:39.039 --> 05:41.174
and I have been promoted
to regional manager.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.843
All:

05:42.876 --> 05:44.311
Yeah, I feel the same way,
may be never meet again.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.513
Of course,

05:45.546 --> 05:47.047
that makes the position
of supervisor available,

05:47.080 --> 05:49.717
so, as of next week,
the ass you'll be kissing

05:49.750 --> 05:51.084
will be that of...

05:51.118 --> 05:53.754
K-83, affectionately
known as Cool Rick.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.155
All:

05:55.188 --> 05:56.557
I know I'm new to the Citadel,

05:56.590 --> 05:58.526
and some of you might not think
I put in my time,

05:58.559 --> 05:59.860
but what can I say?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.028
I'm Cool Rick!

06:01.061 --> 06:02.396
Yo! Ha! Ha!
Check me out!

06:02.430 --> 06:05.065
All right knuckleheads,
any questions?

06:06.634 --> 06:09.069
All right, then, back to work,
you gold rickers.

06:11.271 --> 06:17.578
**

06:17.611 --> 06:19.747
No Ricks, no families,

06:19.780 --> 06:22.850
high off their asses,
and running amuck.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.452
Mortys are raised
to be sidekicks.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.220
Without a side to kick,
they just start kicking.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.690
They were...
They were about my height,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.058
around 14 years old...

06:31.091 --> 06:32.392
oh, their... their shirts
were yellow!

06:32.426 --> 06:34.294
Yeah, make sure
you get that down.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.063
Any mutations, augmentations?

06:36.096 --> 06:38.098
Uh... Three eyes? A tail?
Maybe a buzz cut?

06:38.131 --> 06:39.767
No.
Just four normal Mortys.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.702
Normal?
Put it in your blog.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.236
Let me turn over a few rocks.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.239
Aw, geez.
Hey, what's goin' on, fellas?

06:46.273 --> 06:47.608
Aw, geez, man.
Nothing, man.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.976
We're just hanging out
and stuff.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.243
I hear that.
Aw, geez.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.645
I guess I'm supposed to be
figurin' out

06:51.679 --> 06:53.046
who robbed the store
across the street.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.748
But, aw, geez, I don't know.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.049
Aw, geez man, that sucks

06:56.083 --> 06:57.317
that your Rick's
making you do that.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.620
He's not my Rick.
He's my partner.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.088
Aw, geez.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.557
Well, maybe the uniform
makes a big difference,

07:03.591 --> 07:04.758
who am I to say.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.160
To me, you just look
like a sidekick.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.729
Whoa!
Call me a sidekick
one more time!

07:08.762 --> 07:09.830
Call me a sidekick!

07:09.863 --> 07:10.943
Hey, man! Come on!
Aw, geez!

07:10.964 --> 07:12.232
Wanna see how I paint a wall?!

07:12.265 --> 07:13.767
It was
the Morty Town Locos, man!

07:13.801 --> 07:15.569
The...
The Morty Town Locos!

07:15.603 --> 07:17.004
Aah! Aah!

07:17.037 --> 07:19.272
Do you realize how many codes
you just violated?

07:19.306 --> 07:20.240
Aw, geez, Rick.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.942
What do I know about
knowin' stuff?

07:21.975 --> 07:23.777
Get in the fuckin' car.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.678
More lasers.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.946
You could take more time

07:25.979 --> 07:27.481
to answer the question
if you like.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.485
Okay, Juggling Rick,

07:31.519 --> 07:34.121
how would you solve
the Citadel's financial crisis?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.455
First off, can I just say

07:35.489 --> 07:37.424
that I believe this Citadel
is the greatest

07:37.457 --> 07:38.497
in the entire multi-verse.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.628
Now, I believe
the answer to your question

07:40.661 --> 07:42.095
has three parts.

07:42.129 --> 07:46.033
First, education spending
must get much higher...

07:46.066 --> 07:48.001
But it has to be balanced
with defense...

07:48.035 --> 07:50.003
Whoa! Whoa!
Can we fact check
this please?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.772
Never mind.
Who am I kidding.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.806
This race is over.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.643
And that's how you run
a Citadel!

07:56.877 --> 07:58.178
Candidate Morty,

07:58.211 --> 07:59.647
the number of displaced Mortys
is soaring

07:59.680 --> 08:01.815
while Rick satisfaction levels
are plummeting,

08:01.849 --> 08:03.517
and the divide
between the two groups

08:03.551 --> 08:04.652
has never been wider.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.153
Solve that one real quick.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.824
I don't see a divide
between Ricks and Mortys...

08:10.858 --> 08:11.892
Oh, shocker.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.021
I'd like to offer
a re-buttal.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.064
Gentlemen, gentlemen,

08:17.097 --> 08:18.657
I think we can all agree
on one thing...

08:19.366 --> 08:20.668
Well, it came out as two things

08:20.701 --> 08:21.835
but you get the idea.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.403
You guys finished?

08:24.605 --> 08:25.739
The division I see

08:25.773 --> 08:26.974
is between the Ricks and Mortys

08:27.007 --> 08:28.842
that like the Citadel divided...

08:28.876 --> 08:30.210
and the rest of us.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.913
I see it everywhere I go.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.414
I see it in our schools

08:34.447 --> 08:36.249
where they teach Mortys
we're all the same,

08:36.283 --> 08:38.518
because they're threatened by
what makes us unique.

08:38.552 --> 08:39.753
I see it in our streets

08:39.787 --> 08:41.154
where they give guns to Mortys,

08:41.188 --> 08:42.756
so we're too busy
fighting each other

08:42.789 --> 08:44.858
to fight real injustice.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.393
I see it in our factories

08:46.426 --> 08:48.762
where Ricks work for a fraction
of their boss' salary

08:48.796 --> 08:51.899
even though they're identical
and have the same IQ.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.603
The Citadel's problem
isn't homeless Mortys

08:55.636 --> 08:56.636
or outraged Ricks.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.175
The Citadel's problem
is the Ricks and Mortys

09:02.209 --> 09:03.911
feeding on
the Citadel's death...

09:03.944 --> 09:05.012
Holy Shit!

09:06.546 --> 09:08.048
Rick Security Officer:
He's headed for the flavor core!

09:08.081 --> 09:10.217
But I've got a message for them,

09:10.250 --> 09:13.186
from the Ricks and Mortys
keeping it alive,

09:13.220 --> 09:16.256
a message
from the Ricks and Mortys

09:16.289 --> 09:19.126
that believe in this Citadel

09:19.159 --> 09:21.561
to the Ricks and Mortys
that don't.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.732
You're outnumbered.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.572
Holy Shit.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.807
I don't believe it.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.142
I-I ca believe it.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.611
I know.
That's why you're fired.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.614
Sounds like
you're looking for work.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.915
I can offer you

09:41.949 --> 09:43.483
a very enticing
compensation package.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.452
First, let's talk benefits...

09:46.319 --> 09:48.889
Daddy loves you.
That's Daddy's good girl.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.090
Your life is a lie, man.

09:50.123 --> 09:50.691
All your life's are lies!

09:50.724 --> 09:51.324
All your life's are lies!

09:51.358 --> 09:52.726
Don't you get it?!

09:52.760 --> 09:54.394
They told us we were special
because we were Ricks,

09:54.427 --> 09:56.229
but they stripped us of
everything that made us unique!

09:56.263 --> 09:57.564
We know how you feel.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.266
We're working-stiff Ricks
just like you.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.068
But our assembly line
is justice.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.102
What are your demands?

10:02.135 --> 10:03.403
I-I-I want a portal gun.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.805
Unregistered, untraceable,

10:04.838 --> 10:07.641
with enough fluid to take me off
this God damn prison!

10:07.675 --> 10:10.477
The media's outside.
Well, keep 'em there.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.346
Anyway, so yeah, the suspect
says the Citadel's a lie,

10:13.380 --> 10:15.315
built on lies,
and some other shit.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.250
I say appreciate
the life you have,

10:17.284 --> 10:18.986
because it can always be worse.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.019
Back to you, Ricks.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.155
Thank you,
Rick 0716-C.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.191
That fuckin' guy.
Tell me about it.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.304
Meanwhile, in election news,

10:25.325 --> 10:26.626
an unexpected turn of events

10:26.660 --> 10:28.261
as Morty from the Morty Party

10:28.295 --> 10:29.697
soars to the top of the polls.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.965
Yes.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.601
Morty, what's your
original reality and
where's your Rick?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.437
Gosh, we moved around so much
it's hard to remember.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.306
I see every Rick as my Rick,

10:39.339 --> 10:41.875
I hope they see me
as their Morty.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.211
Another? Please?
With less water?

10:44.244 --> 10:45.612
Hey, cheer up, pal.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.380
A Morty's gonna be president.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.548
Imagine this kisser

10:48.581 --> 10:50.150
getting blamed for everything.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.152
I guess I should've had
more faith.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.155
It's not faith you need.
It's fear.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.725
What's this?

10:57.758 --> 10:58.792
It's secrets.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.346
Wh... wh... wh...
What do you think it is?

11:00.360 --> 11:01.795
Look at how I'm dressed.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.663
Rick Reporter: Having taken aim
at the system,

11:03.697 --> 11:05.498
are afraid at all
for your safety?

11:05.532 --> 11:07.400
Candidate Morty:
I'd rather live in hope
than fear.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.836
If I had to fear anything,

11:08.869 --> 11:10.070
I'd fear other people
being afraid.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.304
Of fear. Itself.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.306
But. No, I'm not afraid.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.242
Morty Town Loco ♪1:
Hey, Rick, man, when
there's a Morty president,

11:15.275 --> 11:16.977
you gonna lick my balls or what?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.511
Sheeeet, grandson,

11:18.545 --> 11:20.180
you keep me peelin' skrabquams
and slippin' nib nibs,

11:20.213 --> 11:22.015
I'll lick whatever
ain't nailed down.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.684
Hands in the air!

11:24.718 --> 11:26.519
What the hell, man?!
What the hellin' hell?

11:26.553 --> 11:28.255
You guys doing a little
chemistry homework

11:28.288 --> 11:30.190
with Grandpa?
Is this what
I think it is?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.725
Bootleg portal fluid.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.865
I guess his math was off.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.399
Search the place.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.740
Are... are you...
my new... R... Rick?

11:46.774 --> 11:48.275
It's okay, Morty.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.215
Jesus.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.549
He stabbed me.
He got me bad, Morty.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.551
Shh. It's okay.
You're okay.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.220
You were right.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.089
Everything I learned
at the academy was...
Doesn't matter.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.391
Nothing's wrong
with putting your
faith in a Morty.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.226
You just gotta pick
the right one.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.928
Why is there a crib in here?

12:07.961 --> 12:10.063
Something they do.
To make you feel bad.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.465
Boy, I got us knee-deep
in paperwork, huh?

12:12.499 --> 12:14.567
Go to the car
and grab a medi-pack.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.303
Let me worry about this.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.245
What happened?
Same old story...

12:25.278 --> 12:27.680
Mortys killing Mortys.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.586
Almost... got it...

12:33.620 --> 12:34.922
Farmer Rick: Hey!

12:34.955 --> 12:37.124
Y'all get the hell away
from my damn mega fruit!

12:38.191 --> 12:39.726
Sic 'em, boy!

12:39.759 --> 12:41.128
I don't wear
this dag-nab hat

12:41.161 --> 12:42.495
and commit
to this rural character

12:42.529 --> 12:44.731
so you can eat for free
while you come of age!

12:44.764 --> 12:47.100
I bet the Wishing Portal
leads to a reality

12:47.134 --> 12:48.601
where they're...
Where all...

12:48.635 --> 12:50.403
Where it's a bunch of
French toast with boobies.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.139
I bet it leads to a place
with a bunch of fry...

12:52.172 --> 12:53.740
Fly... flies everywhere.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.508
Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.944
I bet it's a big hole

12:56.977 --> 12:58.611
where the Citadel dumps
all its broken dreams.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.780
Slick, why do you have to be
so dramatic?

13:00.814 --> 13:02.615
You wanna know why?
Because of this.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.818
I'm part of
an experimental line of Mortys

13:04.852 --> 13:06.319
with a drama implant.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.321
How do you think it feels,
Fat Morty,

13:08.355 --> 13:10.190
to know that
no matter where I go,

13:10.223 --> 13:11.524
I'll always be the one

13:11.558 --> 13:13.493
that makes everybody sad
and a little bored.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.795
Slick, that implant
isn't who you are, okay?

13:15.829 --> 13:18.531
You also roll up your sleeves.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.834
I thought
I was Left-Handed Morty.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.469
Then you should
use your left hand

13:22.502 --> 13:23.837
to eat more vegetables.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.306
Hey, there. How you doing?
Great to meet you.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.474
I'm a plumber, sir.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.667
I'm a Rick, and I'm a plumber.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.110
That doesn't sound like
Rick work.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.711
You didn't come to the Citadel
to be a plumber, did you?

13:31.744 --> 13:33.180
Ha! ha!
I sure didn't, sir!

13:33.213 --> 13:34.547
Mr. Morty! Mr. Morty!

13:34.581 --> 13:36.516
I cloned myself so you could
kiss me as a baby!

13:36.549 --> 13:38.118
This is just like a Morty baby!

13:40.187 --> 13:43.156
Hey, did you, uh,
end up getting a new job?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.324
Yeah, I did.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.357
Assassinating you.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.328
I'm okay...

13:48.361 --> 13:49.997
I'm okay...

13:50.030 --> 13:51.798
I'm...

13:53.400 --> 13:56.136
**

13:56.169 --> 13:58.838
Aw, man. Aw, geez.

13:58.872 --> 13:59.872
Aw, hah.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.741
You look like you could use
a good time.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.211
One dance for $10, two for $25.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.579
No, thank you...
And bad math.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.681
Ha! Ha! Yeah!
This is a good time!

14:08.715 --> 14:10.817
What is this place?
The Creepy Morty.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.685
What is it your kind's
always saying...

14:12.719 --> 14:14.221
"Don't think about it."

14:14.254 --> 14:15.688
Come on.

14:15.722 --> 14:16.990
There's someone important
I want you to meet.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.758
Ah, Bubbala!

14:18.791 --> 14:20.727
How'd it go with
the Morty Town Locos?

14:20.760 --> 14:22.095
They had a little accident.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.397
They won't be causing
any trouble anymore.

14:24.431 --> 14:28.035
Those were bad Mortys.
Very bad Mortys.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.570
Big Morty likes to contribute

14:30.603 --> 14:32.539
to keeping the peace
in Morty Town.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.174
Think of him as a "drug lord"

14:34.207 --> 14:35.875
and us as cops on his payroll.

14:35.909 --> 14:36.910
Morty...

14:36.944 --> 14:38.178
- Which Morty?
- Which Morty?

14:38.211 --> 14:39.412
M... m... my partner.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.514
Morty, you're right.
Morty Town is bad.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.383
But that doesn't mean
that we have to be.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.784
Hey, what's going on here,
Morty?

14:44.817 --> 14:46.219
- Which Morty?
- Which Morty?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.620
The cop, morons!

14:47.654 --> 14:49.789
Don't worry about Rick,
Big Morty.

14:49.822 --> 14:50.822
He's new.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.359
He doesn't understand
how it works.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.627
That's what you said
about your last partner.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.564
Why would you say something
like that, Big Morty?

14:57.597 --> 15:00.600
You're fuckin' things up
for both of us here.
Wrong.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.270
He's fuckin' things up
for both of you.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.772
Unless he takes the money.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.041
Big Morty, you're under arrest.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.477
S... smartest man
in the universe.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.818
They're just props!
Th... they're just props!

15:20.253 --> 15:22.555
Not so big now, are ya?

15:22.589 --> 15:24.257
I never was!
It was figurative!

15:24.291 --> 15:26.559
That's enough.
If we don't kill him,
he'll talk.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.561
If you do, I'll talk.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.163
Cowboy Morty:
O... one thing's for sure,

15:30.197 --> 15:31.931
Y... y'all don't have to worry
about Cowboy Morty talkin'.

15:31.965 --> 15:35.268
This little cowpoke's gonna
mosey up on out of here.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.604
You told me to put my faith
in the right Morty.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.339
I've got faith in you, partner.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.108
Do the right thing.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.743
Oh, Grandpa Rick,

15:43.776 --> 15:45.578
I-I don't wanna be
on the Citadel anymore.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.946
I wanna be a regular kid.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.316
I-I wanna to go to school
and throw balls around

15:49.349 --> 15:50.950
and masturbate.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.527
What the hell happened in there?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.129
Same old story.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.997
Ricks killing Mortys.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.833
Okay, man, okay,
we got your portal gun.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.307
What the hell's he doing?

16:14.341 --> 16:16.643
Where... where am I?
A bad place.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.478
But you're going
to a better one soon.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.980
Hey! Hey!

16:21.014 --> 16:21.881
No, no, no, no...

16:21.914 --> 16:23.150
Whaa...

16:23.183 --> 16:24.117
God damn it!

16:24.151 --> 16:25.818
A portal to
the blender dimension?

16:25.852 --> 16:27.252
That's the oldest trick
in the book!

16:27.254 --> 16:29.289
I'm a Rick!
I'm more Rick than any of you!

16:29.322 --> 16:31.791
Then you should know
you just killed your
only leverage!

16:31.824 --> 16:33.493
Then comes and get me,
motherfucker!

16:37.764 --> 16:40.867
Stop.
I'm Rick D. Sanchez the Third,

16:40.900 --> 16:42.802
owner of this here
wafer establishment,

16:42.835 --> 16:44.971
and I say that the Rick in there
is right.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.506
He's more Rick than any of you.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.674
He's a terrorist!

16:47.707 --> 16:48.841
What Rick isn't?!

16:48.875 --> 16:50.543
This Citadel
was founded by Ricks

16:50.577 --> 16:51.844
for Ricks to be free!

16:51.878 --> 16:53.346
What's your name, young man?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.815
Rick. And I'm...
The same age as me,
I know.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.917
How long
have you worked here?
15 years.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.586
What the hell have we become?

16:59.619 --> 17:01.054
Whatever time
you were gonna make him serve,

17:01.088 --> 17:02.222
he's served it.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.523
It ends now.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.325
Come with me, friend.
Where are we going?

17:05.358 --> 17:06.693
To your new life.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.396
Which starts with walking
the fuck out of here.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.730
- Yo J-22, give 'em hell!

17:13.133 --> 17:15.367
Sam Elliot:
There's a Rick that held
a factory hostage

17:15.402 --> 17:18.171
after murdering his boss
and several coworkers.

17:18.204 --> 17:22.209
The factory made cookies,
flavored them with lies.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.444
He made us all take a look
at what we were doing.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.114
And in the bargain,
he got a taste of real freedom.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.146
**

17:29.249 --> 17:30.617
We captured that taste,

17:30.650 --> 17:31.918
and we keep giving it to him

17:31.951 --> 17:33.720
so he give it right back to you,

17:33.753 --> 17:34.954
in every bite of new

17:34.987 --> 17:36.956
Simple Rick
Freedom Wafer Selects.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.226
Come home to the unique flavor

17:39.259 --> 17:41.528
of shattering
the grand illusion.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.231
Come home to Simple Rick.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.533
It is real.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.569
After you.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.910
Specs: There it is.
The Wishing Portal.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.479
They say for your wish
to come true,

17:59.512 --> 18:02.749
you have to give up something
really important.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.951
For me, that's my panini maker.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.053
I wish for a million sandwiches.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.622
And, yes, I see the irony.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.124
I guess
I wish I had something cooler

18:11.158 --> 18:12.992
than this dumbass
surfer necklace.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.927
I wish incest porn had...

18:14.961 --> 18:16.796
Had a more mainstream appeal.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.298
For...
For a friend of mine.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.567
None of those things
are gonna happen, you know.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.835
Morty wishes never come true.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.103
Not on the Citadel.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.605
Then why did you bring us here?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.240
Because I wish
that would change.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.676
I wish anything about this life
would change.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.943
Well, I hope you're
putting something

18:30.977 --> 18:33.112
pretty God damn important
in there.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.347
Me too.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.815
But I doubt it.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.185
- No!
- Slick!

18:40.153 --> 18:41.621
M... maybe...

18:41.654 --> 18:43.190
maybe it went somewhere nice.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.791
Automated Rick:
Garbage dump.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.993
Stand back.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.932
He had to be stopped.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.034
He... he cou... he c...
Couldn't be allowed to win.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.003
Then you should've
worked on your aim, bro.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.472
He's alive? No, no, no.
You gotta listen to me.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.506
I-I worked for him.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.808
I was his campaign manager.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.876
That Morty is not what he seems.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.479
Yeah, well, no Morty
seems like a president.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.515
He... won?
Yeah.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.817
It was a blow out.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.352
I would hardly call it
a blow out.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.053
It was almost close enough
to trigger a recount.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.856
Jesus. What are you
joke security now too?

19:17.089 --> 19:18.625
Rick Cop:
Why am I still here?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.126
I heard he confessed
to everything.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.329
Your case has been reviewed.
You're free to go.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.498
But... I violated at least
a dozen departmental codes.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.500
New department.
New codes.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.901
New Citadel.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.703
Specs:
Did we miss graduation?

19:30.737 --> 19:31.971
Where are the new Ricks?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.840
No graduation.
No new Ricks.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.875
The school's curriculum
is changing.
To what?

19:35.908 --> 19:37.677
I don't know,
and I don't have to know.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.845
I've been fired.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.247
Good luck, turds.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.115
Holy crap.
Slick's wish came true.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.819
Sorry I'm late,
Mr. President.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.522
Had a little crisis
at work.
Worth it!

19:49.556 --> 19:50.590
It's no problem.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.191
Uh, a little more off the top.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.694
You were saying,
Garment District Rick.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.396
We were saying,
"President" Morty,

19:56.429 --> 19:58.831
that we don't care
who sits in that seat.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.833
A Rick, a Morty,
a god damn Jerry...

20:00.867 --> 20:02.235
It doesn't matter.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.903
We've been running the Citadel
since before the council

20:03.936 --> 20:05.938
and you'll find that we're
still running it now.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.507
Does he really speak
for everyone here?

20:07.540 --> 20:08.841
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.243
Well, I think it's important
to be clear.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.745
Raise your hand
if he speaks for you.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.786
Is... that enough
off the top?

20:19.819 --> 20:22.088
I don't know. Is it?

20:22.121 --> 20:23.556
- Yes, yes, god damn, yes.
- I think it's great.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.224
Good.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.226
This seems like
a good time for a drink

20:27.260 --> 20:30.897
and a cold calculated speech
with sinister overtones.

20:30.930 --> 20:34.567
A speech about politics...

20:34.601 --> 20:36.269
About order...

20:36.303 --> 20:38.405
Brotherhood...

20:38.438 --> 20:39.806
Power.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.074
But speeches
are for campaigning.

20:42.108 --> 20:45.144
Now is the time for action.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.380
**

20:48.948 --> 20:52.619

20:52.652 --> 20:55.722

21:42.835 --> 21:44.937
Whoo!
Yeah!

21:44.971 --> 21:47.106
Atlantis, baby!
That was amazing.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.808
You got some of that
mermaid puss.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.344
I'm really hoping it
wasn't a one-off thing
and I can see her again.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.379
By the way, hey, um,

21:52.412 --> 21:54.013
you're still not
curious about what

21:54.046 --> 21:55.615
what might've happened
at that crazy Citadel place?

21:55.648 --> 21:56.649
Psh. Not at all, Morty.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.884
That place will never have

21:57.917 --> 21:59.719
any bearing over our lives
ever again.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.287
Unlike that mermaid puss!
Whoo!

22:01.320 --> 22:03.523
Yeah! We're going back
for seconds!
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

22:03.556 --> 22:05.057
We're gonna do that shit
every week, man!

22:05.091 --> 22:07.226
That was Atlantis!
Oh, shit!
