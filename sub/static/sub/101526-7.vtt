WEBVTT

00:08.117 --> 00:10.659
Take a good, hard look
at these three.

00:11.868 --> 00:13.326
They were once your brothers.

00:15.784 --> 00:17.117
You broke my heart.

00:18.117 --> 00:19.951
But I'm never gonna let you
embarrass me

00:20.075 --> 00:21.451
or weaken the Tong like this again.

00:21.534 --> 00:23.159
You're the one embarrassing us.

00:23.451 --> 00:25.201
I'm just trying to save the money
you're giving away.

00:25.284 --> 00:26.409
I wasn't giving it away.

00:26.493 --> 00:28.409
He lost it.
- Bullshit!

00:28.493 --> 00:30.451
We outnumber the Long Zii
three to one

00:30.534 --> 00:32.117
yet we're the ones
sitting on our hands?

00:32.367 --> 00:34.201
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:35.992 --> 00:37.117
I'm your son.

00:38.409 --> 00:40.659
You're the son of a common whore

00:41.034 --> 00:43.409
and it's time I burned you out.

00:53.701 --> 00:54.910
What the fuck.

01:02.784 --> 01:05.117
It's okay.
It doesn't matter.

01:05.618 --> 01:07.618
I've served this Tong my whole life.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.618
If he wants to burn me out,
he can go ahead.

01:10.117 --> 01:11.659
Won't change a fucking thing.

01:12.326 --> 01:15.493
Branding us like goddamn cattle
isn't what makes us Hop Wei.

01:18.743 --> 01:20.159
Knock yourself out.

01:46.409 --> 01:47.951
Things have been turning to shit

01:48.075 --> 01:49.534
ever since you let this motherfucker

01:49.618 --> 01:50.951
back into our house.
- I may have lost a fight

01:51.034 --> 01:53.242
but I'm not the one
who bent over for Mai Ling.

01:54.075 --> 01:56.326
The Long Zii
aren't only taking our territory.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.992
They're paying half
of what we pay for opium

02:00.075 --> 02:02.534
because he insists
on importing it from China.

02:02.618 --> 02:04.034
You disloyal shit!

02:04.284 --> 02:06.910
You swore an oath to me!
- We swore an oath to the Tong!

02:06.992 --> 02:08.659
I am the Tong!

02:11.242 --> 02:13.743
We'll have a fresh supply of opium
by next week.

02:15.117 --> 02:16.618
You all know me.
You all know Young Jun.

02:16.701 --> 02:20.034
We weren't stealing.
Every dollar is accounted for.

02:20.117 --> 02:22.951
We did what we did to save the Tong.

02:23.701 --> 02:25.951
Because if we keep doing things
his way

02:26.784 --> 02:29.451
the Long Zii and the Fung Hai
will own us within a year.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.409
Will someone dice this fucking onion?

02:42.659 --> 02:43.659
Now!

02:49.743 --> 02:50.743
Okay.

02:51.576 --> 02:53.493
You're backing this piece of shit
over your own father?

02:53.576 --> 02:55.618
No!
He's backing me!

02:55.701 --> 02:56.743
You're getting played.

02:56.826 --> 02:58.034
Open your eyes!

02:58.992 --> 03:01.534
We're losing ground by the day.
You know that.

03:01.618 --> 03:04.743
And Young Jun is the only one
willing to do a damn thing about it.

03:15.159 --> 03:16.367
What are you doing?

03:19.367 --> 03:20.451
What are you doing?

03:21.659 --> 03:25.117
You! You! All of you!
Kill him now!

03:26.868 --> 03:27.910
Where are you going?

03:30.493 --> 03:32.659
What the fuck are you doing?

03:39.951 --> 03:42.409
We are honoring
your long years of leadership

03:47.075 --> 03:48.951
and celebrating your retirement.

04:00.701 --> 04:02.576
I hope you know what you're doing.

04:15.784 --> 04:16.992
I hope so, too.

04:18.784 --> 04:20.659
Shut up and take the fucking chair.

06:18.201 --> 06:19.451
So, figure it out.

06:20.992 --> 06:22.409
We don't have a lot of time.

06:26.284 --> 06:27.242
Good.

06:34.493 --> 06:36.576
Which one of them
is gonna take over for Zing?

06:37.117 --> 06:39.159
The top three guys
will fight for power

06:39.826 --> 06:41.326
until only one is left.

06:41.826 --> 06:43.075
That's the Fung Hai tradition.

06:43.159 --> 06:45.326
All three of them
will probably end up dead.

06:46.201 --> 06:47.576
Say what you want about Zing

06:47.659 --> 06:49.367
but he kept the Fung Hai
under control.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.409
Zing was out of control.

06:53.659 --> 06:55.409
We can make this work for us.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.576
I guess it's gonna have to.

07:51.868 --> 07:52.826
What?

07:53.367 --> 07:55.159
I never imagined
I'd be spending the night

07:55.242 --> 07:57.534
in a Chinese brothel, of all places.

07:57.618 --> 07:59.618
You prefer American brothel?

08:02.117 --> 08:04.117
I never imagine this, either.

08:16.367 --> 08:18.868
In China, my husband was merchant.

08:20.743 --> 08:22.701
I love him very much.

08:23.910 --> 08:27.075
He sell his silks
to American trading company.

08:28.451 --> 08:32.409
He brings me on trip to America,
to make new deals.

08:37.451 --> 08:39.159
Someone kill him on boat.

08:40.951 --> 08:42.117
Oh, my God.

08:42.201 --> 08:43.201
The men

08:44.326 --> 08:45.951
they want to take me.

08:47.326 --> 08:50.701
They will rape me many times.

08:52.075 --> 08:54.951
But the captain, he protect me.

08:56.367 --> 08:58.284
I become his concubine.

09:01.117 --> 09:03.951
Better to do this
than to be with all of the men.

09:07.034 --> 09:09.743
They throw my husband's body
into the sea.

09:11.326 --> 09:14.159
I come here,
and American trading company say

09:14.242 --> 09:15.618
"No husband, no money."

09:16.201 --> 09:18.034
They take everything I have.

09:19.367 --> 09:21.159
But I was young and pretty.

09:24.534 --> 09:25.951
I survive.

09:27.075 --> 09:28.409
I'm so sorry.

09:28.743 --> 09:31.367
In China, my husband have properties.

09:31.951 --> 09:34.493
He teach me to own land is best.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.784
So I buy, here.

09:39.493 --> 09:42.576
So, you own this place?

09:43.409 --> 09:46.284
Other places.
Outside Chinatown.

09:46.367 --> 09:49.367
You're buying land here?
How?

09:50.284 --> 09:51.868
I have business partner.

09:52.451 --> 09:55.367
White man.
Use his name, my money.

09:55.659 --> 09:59.242
We have many.
200 hectares of land.

09:59.326 --> 10:00.493
200?

10:02.201 --> 10:03.534
But something's wrong?

10:04.367 --> 10:05.951
He not strong man.

10:06.784 --> 10:09.117
I worry for trust him.

10:09.201 --> 10:11.910
Well, you can't have
a business partner you don't trust.

10:15.743 --> 10:16.951
You could use me.

10:20.910 --> 10:21.868
You?

10:21.951 --> 10:23.534
My late husband's estate.

10:23.992 --> 10:26.201
There are so many deeds and titles
on the land

10:26.284 --> 10:27.576
no one would ever notice.

10:28.034 --> 10:30.242
And maybe, down the road

10:30.326 --> 10:32.326
we could use some of that land
for the girls.

10:33.493 --> 10:35.284
There are so many more we could help.

10:43.951 --> 10:45.951
That bad place you go.

10:47.451 --> 10:48.951
Crib brothel.

10:50.534 --> 10:51.826
You took those girls?

10:51.910 --> 10:54.493
Some of them.
I applied what pressure I could

10:54.576 --> 10:56.159
managed to get the place shut down.

10:56.242 --> 10:59.075
But the other girls were just
moved on somewhere new.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.409
Maybe you help them, too?
- I would, if I could.

11:03.284 --> 11:06.117
The police are protecting it.
I can't get in.

11:29.034 --> 11:30.242
You show me where.

11:45.618 --> 11:47.117
I should be dead already.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.992
Doesn't have to be that way.

11:52.576 --> 11:53.784
The hell it doesn't.

11:58.534 --> 12:00.826
How long have you been planning
your little takeover?

12:01.326 --> 12:04.951
I wasn't planning it at all.
It just happened.

12:06.242 --> 12:08.117
I'm sure that's what
he wants you to think.

12:08.826 --> 12:10.451
Your loyal friend, Ah Sahm.

12:10.534 --> 12:11.784
You're wrong about him.

12:11.951 --> 12:13.242
I guess we'll see.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.326
Well, however it happened

12:17.409 --> 12:18.493
you took power.

12:20.367 --> 12:21.743
Now you have to seal it.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.284
I think you know what I mean.

12:27.826 --> 12:28.826
No?

12:29.992 --> 12:32.242
Well, just bring me the knife,
and I'll do it for you.

12:33.117 --> 12:35.075
Consider it a parting gift.

12:35.701 --> 12:38.326
Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

12:38.409 --> 12:41.618
If you don't kill me,
you're gonna look weak.

12:41.701 --> 12:43.242
That's how you would do it.

12:44.284 --> 12:46.075
But you're not
running things anymore.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.910
The smarter move
is to keep you around

12:49.242 --> 12:51.284
use your wisdom and experience.

12:51.951 --> 12:53.951
Or maybe that's just you
making excuses

12:54.075 --> 12:55.367
to hide your weakness.

12:57.284 --> 12:58.784
I know you don't respect me.

12:59.284 --> 13:00.451
You never have.

13:01.951 --> 13:03.201
But you will.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.826
I want him watched at all times.

13:15.326 --> 13:18.784
If anything happens to him,
I'll blame you.

13:42.618 --> 13:44.117
Your breakfast is getting cold.

13:44.201 --> 13:45.992
I had them make you Eggs Florentine

13:46.075 --> 13:47.159
just the way you like them

13:47.826 --> 13:49.576
with horseradish around the edges.

13:50.326 --> 13:51.951
You know the way Daddy used to?

13:52.701 --> 13:55.242
I could have them bring it in here,
if you prefer.

13:55.326 --> 13:57.409
I'm not hungry.
- Penny.

14:04.159 --> 14:06.117
You've hardly eaten in days.

14:06.201 --> 14:09.284
It's just a factory.
It's not our lives.

14:10.701 --> 14:11.910
It was freedom.

14:13.618 --> 14:14.784
For both of us.

14:15.493 --> 14:16.493
From him.

14:16.826 --> 14:20.951
Now, I'll never be able to fill
any meaningful order.

14:21.242 --> 14:23.159
Not that anyone would give me one.

14:24.242 --> 14:26.242
God knows
I don't have the money to rebuild

14:26.326 --> 14:29.784
and Samuel certainly
won't loan it to me. So..

14:29.910 --> 14:31.534
Why don't you just sell it?

14:31.992 --> 14:33.534
Take the money and go.

14:33.701 --> 14:37.242
You could paint, or travel.

14:37.326 --> 14:38.576
What, and prove him right?

14:40.367 --> 14:42.284
That I wasn't smart enough
or strong enough

14:42.367 --> 14:43.534
to run a business?
- Why the hell

14:43.618 --> 14:45.201
would you need
to prove anything to him?

14:49.868 --> 14:50.826
Please.

14:52.242 --> 14:53.951
I just need to be alone right now.

15:05.618 --> 15:08.451
While acting on a tip
from one of the locals

15:08.576 --> 15:10.075
we discovered the sword in question

15:10.159 --> 15:11.534
in this Chinaman's possession..

15:15.367 --> 15:18.409
We also found a pocket watch
in his room

15:18.493 --> 15:20.117
that belonged to one of his victims.

15:20.409 --> 15:21.826
Based on that evidence

15:21.910 --> 15:23.242
and the fact that this man

15:23.576 --> 15:26.451
immediately attempted to murder us
with the same sword

15:26.992 --> 15:30.075
well, we're very certain
we've got our man.

15:30.618 --> 15:31.784
Understood.

15:32.075 --> 15:34.910
I thank you
for your service, Sergeant.

15:35.493 --> 15:38.034
And I commend you on the heroic work

15:38.117 --> 15:41.201
that you
and the Chinatown squad are doing

15:41.284 --> 15:43.451
on behalf of our fine city.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.784
You're dismissed.

15:45.117 --> 15:46.075
Thank you, sir.

15:54.659 --> 15:56.284
Well, that's gonna leave a mark.

15:57.992 --> 15:59.784
The old man's
a real motherfucker, huh?

16:00.826 --> 16:04.034
In your case, you know he actually
fucked your mother, right?

16:06.242 --> 16:07.784
There you go.

16:11.159 --> 16:12.826
You weren't at Ah Toy's last night.

16:13.659 --> 16:15.159
Yeah, I wasn't in the mood.

16:16.201 --> 16:17.576
Still thinking about Vega?

16:19.117 --> 16:20.284
I'm sorry, man.

16:22.451 --> 16:23.784
The life we chose.

16:28.242 --> 16:29.326
I don't know about you

16:29.409 --> 16:31.326
but no one ever gave me
a fucking choice.

16:32.826 --> 16:33.826
You okay?

16:33.951 --> 16:35.075
I don't know, man.

16:37.451 --> 16:38.992
It all just happened so fast.

16:39.075 --> 16:40.159
What, you thought one day

16:40.242 --> 16:43.701
Father Jun would just make
a big announcement

16:44.117 --> 16:45.326
and give you his seat?

16:49.201 --> 16:52.242
I guess I just wanted him
to see me as a worthy successor.

16:53.826 --> 16:57.743
Fathers and sons,
bosses and lieutenants

16:59.159 --> 17:00.743
no one ever just lets go.

17:01.493 --> 17:02.451
What?

17:04.242 --> 17:05.743
So, what, you're getting
all wise on me now?

17:05.826 --> 17:07.367
Hey, I'm the boss' right hand.

17:07.451 --> 17:09.576
I just figured
I have to say shit like that.

17:10.117 --> 17:13.868
Look.
You belong in that seat.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.826
That whole molasses deal with Vega

17:17.284 --> 17:18.992
came together on your watch.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.409
You made that happen.
- And I work for you.

17:26.868 --> 17:28.409
It doesn't always feel that way.

17:29.201 --> 17:31.034
What?
- Nothing.

17:32.868 --> 17:34.242
I'm just feeling
a little edgy, you know?

17:38.576 --> 17:41.284
I'm gonna go get some rest
before the council meeting.

17:43.826 --> 17:45.743
I'm sure that's gonna be
some kind of shitshow.

17:46.326 --> 17:47.284
Maybe.

17:48.910 --> 17:50.326
But it's your shitshow now.

17:51.826 --> 17:53.117
Damn straight.

17:59.701 --> 18:01.117
All rise.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.034
Okay, Zing, stand up.

18:17.743 --> 18:20.284
The accused, John Chinaman

18:20.367 --> 18:22.701
also known as The Swordsman

18:22.784 --> 18:25.784
also known as Ching

18:26.701 --> 18:29.784
has been found guilty
of first-degree murder

18:29.868 --> 18:32.034
by a jury of his peers.

18:33.117 --> 18:35.493
In light of the overwhelming evidence

18:35.576 --> 18:37.201
presented in this courtroom

18:37.284 --> 18:40.784
and the particularly heinous nature
of your crimes

18:41.618 --> 18:45.493
this court hereby
sentences you to death.

18:47.910 --> 18:51.075
Sentence to be carried out
at San Quentin prison

18:51.201 --> 18:53.743
where you will be taken
and hanged by the neck

18:53.826 --> 18:55.409
until you are dead.

18:56.451 --> 18:58.951
May God have mercy on your soul.

19:00.034 --> 19:01.868
This court is now adjourned.

19:37.534 --> 19:39.075
You fared well, didn't you, Bill?

19:40.242 --> 19:41.451
I did, yeah.

19:43.159 --> 19:44.159
I heard some scuttlebutt

19:44.242 --> 19:46.075
that you were somehow
in that chink's back pocket.

19:47.951 --> 19:49.242
You know me better than that.

19:50.075 --> 19:52.701
I was just trying to get
close enough to nail his ass

19:52.826 --> 19:53.910
which is what I did.

19:57.242 --> 19:58.868
I knew it must've been
something like that.

20:01.659 --> 20:02.659
If you'll excuse me.

20:08.576 --> 20:10.618
Today, as we celebrate

20:10.701 --> 20:13.701
Sergeant William O'Hara
and his Chinatown Squad

20:14.743 --> 20:17.242
let us also remember the brave men

20:17.326 --> 20:20.992
who fell in the act of bringing
this murderous fiend to justice.

20:21.326 --> 20:23.409
Officer Sean McLeod.

20:23.576 --> 20:25.868
Officer Paul..

20:25.951 --> 20:27.284
Donnelly.
- Donnelly.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.701
And Officer James Gallahue.

20:29.951 --> 20:31.576
May they rest in peace.

20:32.284 --> 20:34.618
And now, ladies and gentlemen

20:35.075 --> 20:38.117
I present to you
Sergeant William O'Hara.

20:39.117 --> 20:40.075
Christ.

20:40.367 --> 20:41.826
Sergeant O'Hara is the man

20:41.910 --> 20:44.451
we charged with finding
this vicious murderer.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.576
And find him, he did.

20:45.659 --> 20:47.659
He and his men risking life and limb

20:47.743 --> 20:50.159
to bring this monster to justice.

20:50.284 --> 20:53.743
Sergeant O'Hara,
I offer you and your men

20:54.493 --> 20:56.992
the gratitude of an entire city.

21:00.701 --> 21:02.493
But let us make no mistake.

21:02.701 --> 21:04.451
This was but a shot across the bow.

21:04.534 --> 21:05.493
Mr. Leary.

21:06.493 --> 21:08.701
You're starting to become
a regular presence here.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.951
Does the man
ever take a fucking breath?

21:11.117 --> 21:12.242
It's a big day for him.

21:12.743 --> 21:14.159
I should think
you'd be happy as well.

21:14.242 --> 21:16.034
The man we arrested
was responsible for the deaths

21:16.117 --> 21:17.701
of some of your friends, was he not?

21:18.409 --> 21:20.743
You brought down one chink,
and you want a fucking parade?

21:20.910 --> 21:22.451
You got 25,000 to go.

21:22.659 --> 21:24.034
These things take time.

21:24.493 --> 21:25.784
My men don't have time.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.201
They need to be working.

21:27.784 --> 21:29.743
Maybe it's time
you reconsidered your methods

21:29.826 --> 21:31.326
they're obviously not working.

21:32.659 --> 21:36.284
You've amassed a large enough base
to have real influence.

21:37.493 --> 21:38.618
You've already forced the Mayor

21:38.701 --> 21:40.451
to come out
in favor of the working man.

21:40.826 --> 21:43.451
Arson and brute force
will only get you so far.

21:46.201 --> 21:47.534
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.701
I'm talking about votes, Mr. Leary.

21:50.326 --> 21:52.910
The Mayor needs them,
the President needs them

21:52.951 --> 21:55.409
and you've got 'em.
Those are your votes to give.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.159
I'm no fucking politician.

22:05.493 --> 22:07.493
That's what the best ones always say.

22:07.618 --> 22:11.159
God bless you all.
God bless San Francisco.

22:14.284 --> 22:15.910
Ah Toy, I-I don't..

22:16.951 --> 22:19.075
Well, where is this coming from?

22:19.659 --> 22:22.743
Too much risk, for you and me.

22:23.701 --> 22:25.117
We had good business.

22:25.493 --> 22:27.951
Now we separate
before anything bad happen.

22:28.367 --> 22:30.576
Well, what trust
are you transferring these titles to?

22:30.659 --> 22:31.826
Not your concern.

22:32.326 --> 22:34.409
Your concern is sign papers.

22:35.201 --> 22:37.493
I can't do this.
Well, not right now.

22:37.576 --> 22:39.493
I-I-I have leveraged positions.

22:41.326 --> 22:45.201
I've used some of the land
as collateral on other loans.

22:46.618 --> 22:48.701
Look, you-you need
to give me more time.

22:48.784 --> 22:49.951
No more time.

22:52.576 --> 22:53.826
Is this..

22:54.451 --> 22:56.659
Well, you know
you can trust me, right?

22:56.743 --> 22:57.701
I know.

23:04.159 --> 23:05.242
Do you know?

23:08.743 --> 23:11.201
Yeah, I'll get onto this right away.

23:12.367 --> 23:13.326
Okay.

23:14.951 --> 23:16.409
It'll be done by the end of the week.

23:16.826 --> 23:18.618
I made you good profit.

23:19.534 --> 23:22.284
No reason
we don't part with good terms.

23:23.117 --> 23:24.493
Yes, well, of course.

23:24.618 --> 23:26.242
Well, w-we had a good run.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.075
Please feel free to contact me

23:29.159 --> 23:31.284
if you ever need anything else, okay?

23:31.951 --> 23:32.910
Thank you.

24:16.326 --> 24:17.284
Yeah!

24:49.284 --> 24:50.618
I wasn't sure you'd come back.

24:52.326 --> 24:53.784
I wasn't sure myself.

24:55.534 --> 24:57.367
I'm not sure about much these days.

24:59.367 --> 25:00.409
So, why did you?

25:03.284 --> 25:04.242
I don't know.

25:05.493 --> 25:07.034
I guess I couldn't stay away.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.075
My sister.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.743
I've never seen her so defeated.

25:19.910 --> 25:20.910
And it's my fault.

25:20.951 --> 25:22.367
Well, don't take all the credit.

25:24.034 --> 25:26.743
You said yourself that place was not
really what she wanted for her life.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.951
So, now she's free of it.

25:31.451 --> 25:32.618
We all have regrets.

25:33.493 --> 25:34.618
But what's done is done.

25:35.743 --> 25:36.701
Do you?

25:37.576 --> 25:38.701
Have regrets?

25:41.493 --> 25:42.701
Why do you think I drink?

25:44.159 --> 25:45.784
Well, don't you ever get tired of it?

25:47.701 --> 25:49.367
All the violence?

25:50.743 --> 25:51.826
Things need doin'

25:52.659 --> 25:54.201
and I'm the guy
that can get them done.

25:55.784 --> 25:57.576
I can't wait around
hoping someone else will.

26:03.242 --> 26:04.201
Well, it's funny.

26:05.493 --> 26:08.201
Today, someone told me I could
maybe have some political influence

26:08.868 --> 26:10.409
what, with the workingmen behind me.

26:11.367 --> 26:13.284
Can you see me
shaking hands down at City Hall?

26:13.910 --> 26:16.326
Well, you can swing
the entire Irish vote.

26:17.784 --> 26:18.784
They're right.

26:19.493 --> 26:21.534
That gives you
real political capital.

26:22.826 --> 26:24.326
It's all dirty pool down there.

26:26.034 --> 26:28.034
I don't trust those fuckers
as far as I can throw them.

26:28.117 --> 26:30.618
You don't have to trust them,
if you own them.

26:33.910 --> 26:35.117
You trying to civilize me?

26:35.201 --> 26:36.159
Never.

26:37.951 --> 26:39.826
I just don't wanna see
anyone else get hurt.

26:41.826 --> 26:42.951
Especially, you.

26:45.326 --> 26:47.201
What the hell did I ever do
to deserve you?

27:12.159 --> 27:13.743
Looks like you pissed someone off.

27:16.493 --> 27:17.701
Talkin' about your face.

27:19.701 --> 27:20.659
Suits you.

27:20.868 --> 27:22.493
Occupational hazard.

27:22.910 --> 27:23.951
What can I do for you?

27:25.326 --> 27:27.951
Young Jun wants to order
a full set for the Tong.

27:28.784 --> 27:30.201
Hatchets and blades.

27:35.242 --> 27:36.701
This is a lot of hardware.

27:37.951 --> 27:40.075
Makes me think
Young Jun's going to war.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.576
Nah, he just wants to be ready.

27:47.784 --> 27:50.576
So, Father Jun is out.

27:51.451 --> 27:53.367
I honestly didn't think
you'd pull it off

27:53.576 --> 27:54.868
not this fast anyway.

27:55.743 --> 27:57.409
I just backed Young Jun's move.

27:57.493 --> 27:59.284
Maybe. Maybe.

28:00.201 --> 28:02.284
And maybe he needed
someone like you in his corner

28:02.367 --> 28:03.743
to even consider that move.

28:04.326 --> 28:07.951
Either way, taking the seat
isn't the same as keeping it.

28:08.910 --> 28:09.910
He'll keep it.

28:10.951 --> 28:13.159
I'm sorry if that disappoints you.
- No.

28:14.784 --> 28:16.451
No, I know there's no going back.

28:16.826 --> 28:18.910
Believe me, Father Jun knows it too.

28:19.367 --> 28:21.201
He was here
when Chinatown was nothing

28:21.326 --> 28:24.117
just a simple way station
for hungry Chinese laborers.

28:24.201 --> 28:26.451
And now it's an entire city
within a city.

28:26.534 --> 28:30.117
And still, it can change
in the blink of an eye.

28:30.951 --> 28:32.409
Just look what happened to Zing.

28:33.992 --> 28:35.576
You have something to do with that?

28:36.743 --> 28:37.701
Me?

28:38.701 --> 28:41.242
Maybe he was an occupational hazard.

28:44.868 --> 28:46.367
My father used to say

28:47.868 --> 28:49.409
"If you wait by the river
long enough"

28:49.493 --> 28:51.659
"the bodies of your enemies
will come floating by."

28:52.534 --> 28:55.242
No, I think
that was Sun Tzu actually.

28:55.326 --> 28:56.951
Well, he also said it.
Look.

28:59.618 --> 29:02.701
The bulls were satisfied taking down
Zing and a handful of his boys.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.159
They decided
the rest weren't a threat.

29:04.242 --> 29:05.201
They're wrong.

29:05.451 --> 29:06.910
The Fung Hai are leaderless right now

29:06.992 --> 29:07.951
but not for long.

29:08.910 --> 29:11.242
Not if Mai Ling steps in
to absorb them.

29:13.576 --> 29:15.159
I'll discuss it with Young Jun.

29:15.743 --> 29:17.659
I'm sure he'll appreciate it.
- I'm sure he will, too.

29:17.743 --> 29:19.242
But I'm telling you, not him.
Get me?

29:19.326 --> 29:20.284
No, I don't.

29:21.034 --> 29:23.784
The only certainty
in a place like this is uncertainty.

29:24.409 --> 29:25.826
I'm not betting against the Hop Wei

29:25.910 --> 29:27.951
but I wouldn't bet
my fortunes on them either.

29:28.576 --> 29:29.784
And neither should you.

29:30.493 --> 29:32.534
The ones who survive in this chaos

29:32.618 --> 29:34.451
are the ones
who operate between the lines

29:34.868 --> 29:36.075
in the shadows.

29:39.701 --> 29:41.284
Be careful, Chao.

29:41.868 --> 29:43.159
We're just talking here.

29:43.242 --> 29:46.117
No, you're just talking.
Again.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.576
Look, I don't know what you think
you know about me..

29:48.659 --> 29:51.242
I know you're a survivor, like me

29:51.326 --> 29:52.992
and no stranger to the shadows.

29:54.367 --> 29:55.409
I'm just saying

29:55.493 --> 29:58.242
one day it might pay
to have a friend there.

29:59.493 --> 30:00.743
In the shadows?

30:02.784 --> 30:04.367
Give Young Jun my best.

30:04.910 --> 30:07.159
I am, as always, at his service.

30:08.075 --> 30:09.117
And yours.

30:24.951 --> 30:26.451
Look sharp, girls.

30:26.534 --> 30:27.910
We got a customer.

30:29.784 --> 30:30.784
And you, missy

30:32.075 --> 30:33.743
I'm gonna get you nice and clean.

30:51.159 --> 30:53.284
Come along, little whore,
you're gonna like him.

30:54.743 --> 30:55.951
You're gonna like it!

31:05.367 --> 31:06.992
Right at the end, just pull it.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.242
A nice time for you tonight.

31:12.826 --> 31:13.784
Shut up.

31:16.659 --> 31:17.618
Shut up!

31:42.201 --> 31:43.910
The fuck's going on out there?

32:35.034 --> 32:35.992
Lai!

32:38.992 --> 32:40.534
Just finish him.

33:42.075 --> 33:43.117
Jackson.

33:43.910 --> 33:44.868
Bill.

33:45.117 --> 33:46.451
I thought you'd want to see this.

33:46.868 --> 33:48.451
Looks to me like death by sword.

33:48.659 --> 33:51.534
Jesus. They just gave us
the key to the fucking city

33:51.618 --> 33:52.618
for catching a swordsman

33:52.701 --> 33:54.659
and now we gotta deal with this mess.
- I understand

33:54.743 --> 33:56.201
the fucking implications, Harrison.

33:57.701 --> 34:00.284
What do you think, Bill?
- I'm still thinking.

34:01.951 --> 34:02.992
Anyone see anything?

34:03.951 --> 34:05.034
Where are the girls?

34:05.409 --> 34:06.701
No one here, but the stiffs.

34:06.910 --> 34:08.367
You think we got the wrong guy?

34:08.451 --> 34:09.451
Of course not.

34:09.701 --> 34:11.701
Come on.
You've been working here too long

34:11.784 --> 34:13.534
to think there's only one Chinaman
capable of this shit.

34:13.618 --> 34:17.534
So, another swordsman.
Is that it?

34:17.826 --> 34:19.451
I don't think
the press will see it that way.

34:21.117 --> 34:23.576
Look, Bill.
I can walk out

34:23.910 --> 34:25.534
and I can pretend
I didn't see a thing.

34:34.201 --> 34:36.242
And what would you be wanting
for taking that walk?

34:37.201 --> 34:38.576
Well, you're a big deal now, Bill.

34:39.659 --> 34:41.992
I figure your recommendation
for Sergeant would go a long way.

34:48.117 --> 34:49.743
You've got it.
Go on.

34:54.451 --> 34:56.075
Well, what are we waiting for?

34:56.784 --> 34:58.159
Let's clean this mess up.

35:04.451 --> 35:05.701
Where did you find it?

35:08.159 --> 35:09.493
Buckley had a woman.

35:10.451 --> 35:11.493
He went to war

35:12.075 --> 35:14.493
and apparently returned to her
a very different man.

35:15.743 --> 35:18.743
They lasted a few years,
but in the end he left.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.534
She's since gotten married,
had a few kids

35:23.659 --> 35:25.117
but she kept the photograph.

35:26.576 --> 35:28.451
Took some doing getting it from her.

35:33.451 --> 35:35.493
You understand
what you're looking at there?

35:36.992 --> 35:37.910
I do.

35:39.951 --> 35:42.701
So, you know what it's worth.

35:57.951 --> 35:59.326
'Get out.'

36:15.618 --> 36:16.784
Mr. Merriweather!

36:17.910 --> 36:20.618
Mrs. Blake. - Your secretary
told me where I could find you.

36:20.743 --> 36:22.618
I was sorry
to hear about your factory.

36:23.075 --> 36:24.743
It seems none of us are safe.

36:25.075 --> 36:27.159
I know circumstances
have changed a bit

36:27.242 --> 36:28.493
but I was wondering.

36:29.159 --> 36:32.284
The deal you proposed,
is it still on the table?

36:45.826 --> 36:47.284
Forgive me, Father.

36:47.367 --> 36:48.743
"Bless me, Father."

36:50.951 --> 36:53.326
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

36:53.951 --> 36:54.910
It's been..

36:56.659 --> 36:58.910
To tell the truth,
I've never been to confession.

36:58.992 --> 37:00.493
Now, how can that be?

37:00.784 --> 37:02.242
I was raised Methodist.

37:03.910 --> 37:06.534
Lost sheep stray here all the time.

37:07.409 --> 37:09.701
What burdens
have you brought us, my son?

37:11.868 --> 37:13.951
I have..
I've been..

37:15.409 --> 37:20.075
Incautious in how I've used money
others trusted me to invest.

37:22.367 --> 37:23.367
Go on.

37:23.618 --> 37:26.992
Well, I have a partner
about to leave me badly exposed.

37:27.075 --> 37:29.367
And, well, if that happens,
I'll be ruined.

37:31.618 --> 37:33.409
I was told that you..

37:34.992 --> 37:37.367
You could be of some help
in these kinds of situations.

37:37.701 --> 37:41.284
Indeed I can,
as an emissary of the Lord.

37:46.242 --> 37:48.576
So, what do I do?
- You make an offering.

37:50.451 --> 37:51.784
That means cash.

38:16.367 --> 38:17.326
God.

39:03.868 --> 39:05.659
Ah Toy, you made it.

39:06.117 --> 39:07.826
I was starting to get worried.

39:08.951 --> 39:11.910
Long trip.
Many girls.

39:12.284 --> 39:14.534
We clean them up, let them rest.

39:14.618 --> 39:15.826
More come tomorrow.

39:15.910 --> 39:17.117
Oh, my God.

39:17.451 --> 39:18.493
How did you do it?

39:19.451 --> 39:21.159
You have room, yes?

39:22.576 --> 39:24.451
You're a remarkable woman,
you know that?

39:56.034 --> 39:58.242
'Come. Come.'

39:59.367 --> 40:00.951
'Come.'

40:07.159 --> 40:08.117
Nellie.

40:24.784 --> 40:25.743
Lai, wait.

40:31.451 --> 40:32.743
You're staying, too.

40:35.951 --> 40:36.951
No more killing.

40:39.367 --> 40:41.201
You can build a life here.

40:42.618 --> 40:43.576
A better one.

40:49.409 --> 40:50.618
Lai, get down.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.242
Come on.

40:57.284 --> 40:58.701
I'm not asking.

41:04.367 --> 41:07.034
If you stay with me,
you start seeing Johns tonight.

41:07.910 --> 41:09.826
You wanna be a whore?
Is that what you want?

42:08.743 --> 42:10.701
I know better than most

42:10.784 --> 42:12.576
nothing can make up
for the loss of a loved one.

42:12.659 --> 42:14.784
But I hope

42:14.868 --> 42:17.409
it's some small consolation

42:17.493 --> 42:18.826
that I could bring this back to you.

42:20.743 --> 42:21.743
I couldn't believe it

42:21.826 --> 42:25.992
when Officer O'Hara said
he'd found it on that Chinaman.

42:27.201 --> 42:28.451
It was quite a lucky break.

42:29.075 --> 42:31.159
I had no idea it was even missing.

42:32.117 --> 42:34.826
I've barely stepped foot
in Victor's study since that night.

42:35.951 --> 42:36.951
I understand.

42:37.868 --> 42:39.367
It's enough of a violation

42:39.451 --> 42:43.242
that one of those animals
was in our home.

42:43.326 --> 42:46.159
I told Officer O'Hara
as much last week.

42:47.326 --> 42:51.367
But knowing that they had
something so personal of Victor's

42:51.826 --> 42:52.951
something I had given him

42:53.075 --> 42:54.284
for our anniversary..
- I'm-I'm sorry, ma'am.

42:54.367 --> 42:57.659
You..
You told Officer O'Hara?

42:58.117 --> 42:59.075
Yes.

43:00.367 --> 43:01.367
I'm confused.

43:01.951 --> 43:05.075
He came to see you?
Last week, you say?

43:05.159 --> 43:08.075
Well, yes. He-He said there'd been
a possible break in the case.

43:08.326 --> 43:10.326
He-He asked
if he could have a look around.

43:39.159 --> 43:40.242
We're closing up.

43:40.701 --> 43:42.075
I-I don't want any meat.

43:42.159 --> 43:44.534
Well, then you've come
to the wrong place.

43:45.284 --> 43:46.242
But

43:47.784 --> 43:49.576
Father Herlihy sent me.

43:57.367 --> 43:59.451
And how is the good Father
these days?

44:05.493 --> 44:07.576
He sends his best.

44:15.451 --> 44:19.367
Well, any friend of the Father's
is a friend of ours.

44:26.284 --> 44:28.159
I guess you're not angry at me
anymore.

44:31.451 --> 44:32.534
I am.

44:35.201 --> 44:36.201
Mai Ling..

44:44.576 --> 44:46.618
No one can do what I can do

44:47.242 --> 44:48.618
for this Tong

44:51.159 --> 44:52.451
or for you.

44:55.784 --> 44:56.701
What are you doing?

44:57.493 --> 44:58.451
Let go.

44:59.034 --> 44:59.951
Mai Ling.

45:01.117 --> 45:02.201
Let go.

45:13.784 --> 45:15.034
Trust me.

45:17.618 --> 45:18.701
Or don't.

45:20.951 --> 45:23.159
Choose, right now.

45:54.534 --> 45:55.534
You'll see.

45:56.075 --> 45:58.201
Prosperity will set all things right.

45:58.743 --> 46:00.992
Of course, there will be some pain
in the beginning.

46:01.075 --> 46:02.659
We'll have to pinch some pennies.

46:03.075 --> 46:05.826
But it's time we put our own men
back to work again.

46:06.201 --> 46:09.326
And how exactly
are we supposed to pay the salaries

46:09.409 --> 46:11.075
that those men will be asking for?

46:11.159 --> 46:12.743
I'm sure you'll manage it, Lymon.

46:12.826 --> 46:16.493
Surely even you can see the value
of employing your fellow Americans.

46:16.576 --> 46:18.451
You live in a political fantasy.

46:19.326 --> 46:21.367
I live in the reality of numbers.

46:21.618 --> 46:24.576
This country's been teetering
ever since the panic of '73.

46:24.701 --> 46:28.159
And now, just as we start seeing
light at the end of the tunnel

46:28.242 --> 46:29.659
you want to turn it off.

46:30.534 --> 46:32.326
A bit dramatic, don't you think?

46:32.409 --> 46:34.659
The difference in payroll
won't break you.

46:34.951 --> 46:36.868
We all know you can afford it, Lymon.

46:37.326 --> 46:39.242
Listen to you go on

46:39.701 --> 46:42.284
as if you don't already know
your own wife's company

46:42.367 --> 46:45.159
is gonna be forging steel
for my buildings.

46:45.743 --> 46:46.743
I'm sorry, what did you say?

46:46.910 --> 46:49.910
Using Chinese labor.
- He's right.

46:50.951 --> 46:52.743
I reckon the economics
are a bit different

46:52.826 --> 46:54.284
when you share a bed with the Mayor.

46:55.576 --> 46:58.576
Don't be ridiculous.
There will be no favors.

46:58.910 --> 47:01.034
Everyone will be held
to the same standard.

47:01.117 --> 47:04.743
I don't care which side of your mouth
you're using out there on the street

47:04.951 --> 47:08.367
making political promises
to the working men and such.

47:09.034 --> 47:12.451
But, in here,
let's all understand each other.

47:12.868 --> 47:14.743
Chinese labor

47:14.826 --> 47:17.201
is the only thing
that keeps this city afloat.

47:17.284 --> 47:21.075
That's true. - And any mayor
who doesn't grasp that

47:21.159 --> 47:22.576
is gonna be out of a job.

47:24.075 --> 47:25.868
Well, Lymon

47:26.868 --> 47:29.576
as always, I appreciate your counsel.

47:31.117 --> 47:32.409
Misguided though it may be.

47:32.493 --> 47:34.493
If you think I'm misguided, Samuel

47:34.659 --> 47:37.618
go home and seek counsel
from your wife.

47:39.284 --> 47:41.409
Perhaps, she should be the one
running the city.

47:48.159 --> 47:49.284
Another one, sir?

47:58.868 --> 48:00.201
That's as far as I go.

48:02.284 --> 48:03.992
You think you'll ever walk me
all the way home?

48:05.659 --> 48:07.576
You can't take the whole world on
at once, Sophie.

48:08.743 --> 48:10.117
Really?
Coming from you?

48:17.117 --> 48:18.367
I'll see you when I see you.

48:34.117 --> 48:35.117
Oh, God.

48:46.576 --> 48:47.534
Well

48:50.534 --> 48:51.576
say something.

48:53.784 --> 48:54.743
Get out.

48:55.701 --> 48:57.576
No.
We should talk about this.

48:57.659 --> 49:00.659
Pack your things
and get out of my house.

49:00.743 --> 49:01.743
Now!

49:07.910 --> 49:09.784
You mean get out of his house,
don't you?

49:25.618 --> 49:27.075
And there she is.

49:27.409 --> 49:30.326
Samuel.
You surprised me.

49:30.409 --> 49:32.242
Not as much as you surprised me.

49:33.409 --> 49:34.784
What?
- Did you really think

49:34.868 --> 49:36.618
I wouldn't find out
about your little deal

49:36.701 --> 49:38.784
with Merriweather?
- I can't do this right now.

49:38.868 --> 49:41.576
He and his friends had a good laugh
telling me all about it.

49:41.659 --> 49:43.075
You pulled your orders.

49:43.159 --> 49:45.576
I had to make another deal
to save my company.

49:45.659 --> 49:48.034
I've been living on a knife's edge
for the past six months

49:48.117 --> 49:50.367
and all you care about is a company

49:50.451 --> 49:52.618
that should've died with your father.

49:52.701 --> 49:55.409
You're drunk.
I'm going to bed.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.534
You can sleep it off down here.

49:57.618 --> 49:59.159
You have no idea what you're doing.

49:59.242 --> 50:01.910
You're gonna piss away
my career and our future.

50:01.992 --> 50:04.075
Over a second-rate foundry

50:04.159 --> 50:06.409
just to prove some damn point?
- What are you talking about?

50:06.493 --> 50:09.618
Crestwood offers a direct line
to the presidency.

50:09.743 --> 50:11.409
He could send me
right into the governorship

50:11.493 --> 50:13.159
and from there, who knows?
- Governor?

50:14.034 --> 50:15.659
You never told me
anything about this.

50:15.743 --> 50:16.784
Why should I?

50:16.951 --> 50:19.576
When you spend
your every waking moment

50:19.659 --> 50:21.075
trying to undermine me.
- Samuel, listen..

50:21.159 --> 50:22.534
If it weren't for me,
you and your sisters

50:22.618 --> 50:24.201
would be begging in the streets.

50:24.326 --> 50:26.826
So, you're gonna call off
your deal with Merriweather

50:26.910 --> 50:28.201
and sell him the damn company.

50:28.284 --> 50:30.034
At a loss, if you have to.
- I'd be playing

50:30.117 --> 50:32.242
right into his hands.
That's exactly what he wants.

50:32.326 --> 50:33.992
That's exactly what I want!

50:34.701 --> 50:35.868
I am through

50:35.951 --> 50:38.951
indulging this
misguided fantasy of yours!

50:39.034 --> 50:40.159
Then divorce me!

50:47.075 --> 50:48.034
What?

50:48.784 --> 50:49.910
Divorce me.

50:50.534 --> 50:52.534
It'll solve both our problems.

50:55.493 --> 50:56.576
Penny, dear.

50:59.201 --> 51:00.326
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

51:01.284 --> 51:03.826
I-I-I'm..
I-I'm drunk.

51:07.784 --> 51:09.242
Penny! Penny!

51:09.659 --> 51:10.618
Christ!

51:10.701 --> 51:12.868
Why are you doing this to me?
- Get off me!

51:14.117 --> 51:16.910
Why, goddammit?
- Get off me!

51:18.075 --> 51:20.075
Jesus Christ!

51:39.826 --> 51:41.618
Get off, you bastard!

51:41.701 --> 51:42.743
Sophie!

51:42.868 --> 51:43.951
Sophie!

51:44.159 --> 51:45.826
Get off me!

51:45.951 --> 51:47.826
Oh, my God!

51:49.242 --> 51:50.284
Sophie!

51:53.409 --> 51:54.701
No!
- Sophie!

51:59.910 --> 52:00.868
No!

52:07.576 --> 52:10.117
Why are you doing this to me, Penny?

52:13.075 --> 52:15.576
Why in God's name
are you making me do this, Penny?

52:16.284 --> 52:17.826
Why are you doing this?

52:20.743 --> 52:22.451
Why are you doing this?

52:23.409 --> 52:24.868
Why?

52:25.326 --> 52:26.284
Why?

52:27.409 --> 52:28.618
Why?

52:30.284 --> 52:31.367
Why?
