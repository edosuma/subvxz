01:32.885 --> 01:34.804
I should be home by six.

01:54.157 --> 01:57.160
"Viva Caputa."

01:57.869 --> 01:59.078
What does that mean?

01:59.162 --> 02:00.455
I never asked him.

02:12.342 --> 02:13.968
Wow, what happened here?

02:15.136 --> 02:16.429
Was there a fire?

02:17.347 --> 02:18.765
Yeah, it burned down.

02:18.848 --> 02:19.724
Really?

02:21.059 --> 02:21.976
How?

02:24.520 --> 02:25.355
No idea.

02:31.486 --> 02:32.945
What was it like inside?

02:35.406 --> 02:36.824
Like a restaurant.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.327
Nothing special.

02:46.501 --> 02:49.253
There was a guy from a magazine
who came one night.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.632
Ate a meal, wrote about it.

02:55.593 --> 02:56.928
Made my dad real proud.

03:00.807 --> 03:04.268
Well, if the food was good
and people liked it, what--?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.187
What do you think went wrong?

03:08.606 --> 03:10.566
My dad trusted the wrong guys.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.403
Owed a lot of money.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.950
Then he pulled some stupid shit
trying to pay them all back.

03:21.411 --> 03:22.829
What exactly did he do?

03:25.832 --> 03:27.834
Obviously,
the way this is going, I can't--

03:27.917 --> 03:29.043
You can't.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.587
Ehh. Depends.
If it's this kind of a month--

03:31.671 --> 03:33.131
Everything okay?

03:33.339 --> 03:36.008
-Hey, what--? What the fuck, man?
-It's okay. It's okay.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.176
He's with me.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.930
-Yeah, I wanted to help you get set up.
-Okay.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.890
-That your kid?
-Can we do this another time?

03:42.974 --> 03:46.519
-Can we figure this out for another time?
-No, no, no. Come on, man. Come on.

03:46.728 --> 03:47.562
Okay.

03:47.645 --> 03:51.691
Would you go inside and get the branzino
out of the fridge for me, okay?

03:52.483 --> 03:53.693
Hm?

03:54.777 --> 03:55.695
What are you doing?

03:57.196 --> 03:59.782
Shit, man. Seriously,
wanna just text me or something?

03:59.991 --> 04:02.952
-We'll figure this out. All right.
-Fuck that. Want this or not?

04:03.035 --> 04:03.995
Come on.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.665
Come on. There's 300 bucks.
Just give me the pills. Come on.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.710
See you soon.

04:13.129 --> 04:14.922
What the fuck are you doing?

04:18.593 --> 04:20.344
You're gonna get busted.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.019
Let's get started, okay?
We've got specials to get ready.

04:30.605 --> 04:33.024
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know what he did.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.779
All I know is it didn't work.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.326
He should've come to us.

04:44.869 --> 04:46.162
We would've helped him.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.543
Did he ever find a way
to pay off his debt?

04:53.294 --> 04:54.212
No.

04:58.174 --> 04:59.842
Maybe they burned it down.

05:01.803 --> 05:03.304
That's what my dad thought.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.517
I needed to see this.

05:10.353 --> 05:11.854
Well, we can go home now.

05:13.439 --> 05:14.649
Uh...

05:14.941 --> 05:16.901
Do you mind if we make one more stop?

05:24.200 --> 05:25.993
He says you beat him up.

05:26.911 --> 05:29.247
Yeah, well, you know,
things got a little physical.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.748
Jesus.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.836
Jesus, John. What are you thinking?

05:35.628 --> 05:38.130
-I wasn't thinking.
-Who is this guy?

05:38.339 --> 05:42.718
He's some punk from Miami. He's just--
He's out to cause trouble. That's it.

05:43.678 --> 05:47.807
-How does he know about Red Reef Motel?
-I guess he can read a newspaper, Meg.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.850
He's saying that you were there...

05:50.142 --> 05:52.311
the night that Lowry's guy attacked Danny.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.314
There you go. What am I supposed
to say to that? Come on.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.567
-Where would he get that idea?
-Fuck if I know.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.318
So we can stop talking about it.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.529
Hey. He wants money to keep quiet.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.073
I don't give a fuck what he wants.

06:06.951 --> 06:08.786
-Hey, look at me.
-What?

06:09.161 --> 06:10.288
What is going on?

06:10.496 --> 06:11.831
Goddamn it, Meg.

06:11.998 --> 06:13.916
Can't protect us
if you're not telling me things.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.335
You're not gonna have
any more contact with this guy.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.713
You're not gonna give him money.
He's a nobody.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.756
How can I make that any clearer?

06:21.549 --> 06:23.134
Do you understand what I'm saying?

06:27.763 --> 06:28.598
Good.

06:42.445 --> 06:46.324
Ohh. Oh, shit. There he is.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.661
There he is. The man of the hour.

06:51.746 --> 06:53.539
Why am I the man of the hour?

06:54.248 --> 06:56.584
For one thing,
you brought me down here, right?

06:56.876 --> 07:00.087
And then, two,
you told me about Danny and the Red Reef,

07:00.171 --> 07:02.840
so you basically gave me the keys
to the kingdom, bro.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.301
What kingdom?

07:05.718 --> 07:07.720
Come on, now. Don't--
You don't gotta worry.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.055
Okay?

07:09.388 --> 07:12.141
You don't gotta worry
because I'm not that type of guy.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.728
Not the type of guy
who cuts out his friends, all right?

07:16.604 --> 07:18.022
Leave me out of it.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.234
Are you sure about that?

07:22.777 --> 07:26.906
You sure about that? Because I'm about
to be able to write my own fucking ticket.

07:28.574 --> 07:31.160
You're still fucking with John Rayburn,
aren't you?

07:31.369 --> 07:35.498
You gotta leave that shit alone, Oz.
It's gonna bite me in the fucking ass.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.084
You don't get it, do you?

07:39.085 --> 07:41.587
You just-- You just don't get it, man.

07:41.754 --> 07:43.881
It's because you're a single man.
That's why.

07:43.965 --> 07:45.383
You ain't got no encumbrances.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.927
What does that have to do
with anything, dude?

07:48.135 --> 07:49.845
I got a lot of responsibilities, man.

07:49.929 --> 07:52.974
I got my lady.
I got the kid and everything.

07:53.182 --> 07:56.394
And she's never gonna be fucking happy
until he's provided for.

07:57.311 --> 08:00.064
If it was up to me,
I would cut the little fucker loose.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.232
That's what I would do.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.359
So, I'm gonna have to...

08:03.651 --> 08:04.986
cash in down here,

08:05.194 --> 08:07.738
get set up with the proceeds,

08:07.989 --> 08:09.156
and then...

08:09.240 --> 08:13.828
I wanna fucking live it up, man.
I wanna really fucking live.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.416
And...

08:18.791 --> 08:21.210
I don't want you to tell anybody, okay?

08:21.293 --> 08:22.712
Don't tell nobody.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.255
This is between you and me.

08:24.797 --> 08:26.048
I'm gonna surprise her.

08:26.590 --> 08:30.011
I've been talking to this producer guy,
and I'm renting some studio time,

08:30.094 --> 08:32.179
so she can record her second album.

08:32.430 --> 08:35.057
- Yeah?
- Well, come on. She's got it, man.

08:35.266 --> 08:36.976
-Oh, yeah.
-She-- No, seriously, dude.

08:37.059 --> 08:41.480
-She's got-- She's the real deal.
-You're really a little nuts, huh?

08:41.689 --> 08:42.857
Shit.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.150
It's gonna happen.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.652
It's gonna happen. You know why?

08:46.736 --> 08:48.779
-Why?
-Because I believe.

08:50.448 --> 08:52.408
I believe!

08:52.491 --> 08:54.744
I believe!

08:55.619 --> 08:59.040
Okay, let's say John saw the whole thing
from the motel parking lot.

08:59.290 --> 09:00.666
How does this guy know?

09:01.250 --> 09:02.668
Maybe there was a witness.

09:03.294 --> 09:05.838
Oh, no way.
He wouldn't leave us vulnerable like that.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.882
-John would have said something.
-Really?

09:08.090 --> 09:10.593
He didn't tell us
that he beat the shit out of the guy.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.678
He didn't tell us that Danny made a tape.

09:13.012 --> 09:15.473
I don't know what else
he's keeping from us.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.934
What does he want you to do?

09:19.143 --> 09:20.144
Nothing.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.562
He won't talk to me.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.356
-Does he seem worried about it?
-I don't know.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.734
But I don't trust his judgment.

09:26.817 --> 09:30.488
If this guy talks, the campaign is fucked
and we're all exposed.

09:32.907 --> 09:34.700
Okay, then we gotta shut it down.

09:37.203 --> 09:38.746
We have to pay this guy.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.335
How much money can you borrow
from your business?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.379
Are you kidding me?
Meg, look at this place.

09:47.463 --> 09:48.881
I'm fucking broke.

09:49.799 --> 09:53.260
I don't have any money.
I'm days away from losing this place.

09:53.803 --> 09:55.471
You didn't tell me it was that bad.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.391
That's because it's my problem,
and I'm-- I'm working on it.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.605
God...

10:05.564 --> 10:06.732
Okay, what--?

10:07.233 --> 10:08.859
What's the best option here?

10:08.943 --> 10:10.903
How do we deal with this guy?

10:13.989 --> 10:15.574
I gotta think about it, okay?

10:15.658 --> 10:18.786
-I'll, uh... just call you later.
-Yeah.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.420
It's Pamela Ortiz.

10:29.171 --> 10:32.424
I don't understand what's happening.
I've called you several times.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.302
Call me back, please.

10:35.803 --> 10:36.720
Please?

11:08.669 --> 11:10.713
I can forgive so much.

11:16.927 --> 11:17.928
Not that.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.301
<i>Two men and a woman</i>
<i>were rescued Wednesday morning</i>

12:39.385 --> 12:42.680
<i>after their boat capsized</i>
<i>in the area of Alligator Lights,</i>

12:42.763 --> 12:45.641
<i>about four miles off Islamorada</i>

<i>...a.m. from someone who reported</i>

12:52.648 --> 12:54.984
<i>Coast Guard station Islamorada</i>

12:55.067 --> 12:57.569

<i>The Coast Guard said</i>

-Hello.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.877
Yes, Ms. Ortiz. I know who you are.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.964
<i>...about 18 miles to the northeast.</i>
<i>At Molasses at 9 a.m...</i>

13:30.936 --> 13:33.772
<i>Stay tuned for 30 minutes</i>

14:06.555 --> 14:09.058
Get a picture of everything
that's not a boat, okay?

14:09.141 --> 14:11.727
Everything laying on the ground,
I want a picture of it.

14:16.774 --> 14:17.858
Can I help you?

14:19.860 --> 14:20.944
Mr. Kevin Rayburn?

14:21.153 --> 14:22.529
Yeah.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.156
Good morning, sir.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.825
We're here from Key Atlantic Bank.

14:27.326 --> 14:29.578
Just here to appraise your land,
your structures,

14:29.661 --> 14:33.415
your movables for the process
of asset reclamation.

14:33.624 --> 14:37.669
So in English, you're telling me what?
Bank sent you here to repossess my stuff?

14:37.753 --> 14:39.463
I'm afraid so.

14:39.671 --> 14:43.759
If you'd be so kind as to give us
information, we'd greatly appreciate it.

15:04.822 --> 15:06.156
How long have you lived here?

15:06.824 --> 15:08.617
On and off my whole life.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.749
Landlord finally did it.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.173
Asshole's been threatening for years.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.552
They probably changed the locks.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.351
Give me a minute.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.486
I just need to grab a few things.

15:50.284 --> 15:51.452
<i>The machinery's working.</i>

15:51.994 --> 15:54.204
-Polls are heading in the right direction.
-Yep.

15:54.705 --> 15:57.124
We're really fortunate.
John's doing very well.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.043
Here's the fruits
of another round of fundraising.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.129
Donors' names are in there.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.006
Thank you.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.758
So, you set with the volunteers,
resources?

16:06.842 --> 16:08.427
Anything else I can help you with?

16:10.679 --> 16:12.473
Looks like we're all solid.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.604
I think your brother should step up
his public appearances.

16:18.687 --> 16:19.730
Maybe...

16:20.439 --> 16:24.109
arrange a couple of debates
with the other candidates.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.653
Yeah. You're right. I'll talk to him.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.280
John's got character.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.908
A dignity that Aguirre can't match.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.995
Now is the time to let them
go head-to-head in a public forum.

16:36.955 --> 16:40.042
I'll get in touch with Aguirre's people,
and I'll set something up.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.543
Yeah, good. Do that.

16:44.338 --> 16:47.716
I have something to ask you.
Might be inappropriate, stop me if it is.

16:47.799 --> 16:48.800
What's that?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.720
You know my other brother, Kevin?

16:52.262 --> 16:54.264
He has a boatyard off Indian Key.

16:54.473 --> 16:57.226
-I know it by reputation.
-Yeah. He's great at what he does.

16:57.726 --> 17:00.437
It's just the business
is going through a rough patch.

17:00.646 --> 17:01.980
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.899
So, he's looking for investors,

17:03.982 --> 17:05.317
and I just thought

17:05.400 --> 17:08.111
maybe if you knew someone
interested in that kind of thing?

17:08.320 --> 17:10.405
I'll put some thought into it.

17:10.489 --> 17:11.323
Great.

17:12.241 --> 17:14.076
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

17:14.284 --> 17:17.412
I know plenty of people
looking for a good opportunity.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.146
Hey.

17:56.535 --> 17:59.037
Where in the world did you find this?

18:00.497 --> 18:01.873
I've had it since I was a kid.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.293
That was our first sign.

18:04.835 --> 18:05.919
Did your dad tell you?

18:06.795 --> 18:07.713
Yeah.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.174
He didn't like seeing it.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.678
So why did you keep it?

18:17.931 --> 18:19.182
I don't remember.

18:21.310 --> 18:23.437
I should've just let him throw it out.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.453
Oh, may I...?

18:39.536 --> 18:40.454
May I look?

18:42.998 --> 18:44.333
Knock yourself out.

19:03.810 --> 19:04.853
You knew my husband?

19:09.733 --> 19:10.942
You knew Robert?

19:13.445 --> 19:15.364
No. I only met him once.

19:21.036 --> 19:24.623
Good morning. This is Marco Diaz from
the Monroe County Sheriff's Department.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.460
Good morning.
Could I speak to Mr. Moros, please?

19:31.672 --> 19:34.675
Okay, well, can you have him
give me a call back? It's important.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.235
-Hi. Good morning.
-Morning.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.278
Uh, I'm here to see Mr. Garnet.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.446
And your name is?

19:56.530 --> 19:57.364
Kevin Rayburn.

19:58.532 --> 19:59.866
Didn't we speak on the phone?

20:00.659 --> 20:01.493
Yeah.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.080
There must've been a misunderstanding.
Mr. Garnet isn't available.

20:05.205 --> 20:09.126
I understand. I thought I'd just come down
and see if his day kind of opens up.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.044
I have to ask you to leave.

20:11.336 --> 20:14.756
You know what? It's fine. I'm just
gonna have a seat right over here--

20:14.840 --> 20:16.758
-No, you can't--
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.692
Hey, let's get out of here.

20:35.152 --> 20:36.987
Your mother looks so sweet here.

20:41.199 --> 20:44.286
-I look like a fucking monkey.
-No, you don't.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.371
You're very handsome.

20:47.456 --> 20:50.208
-When was this taken?
-I don't know.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.631
-My dad took that picture.
-Really?

20:57.549 --> 20:58.842
-Do you remember that?
-No.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.262
But my mom tells the story.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.726
My dad wouldn't shut up about
wanting to try some new restaurant

21:07.809 --> 21:12.272
on the waterfront,
so she decides she's gonna surprise him.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.400
So, she saves up for months.

21:16.610 --> 21:18.445
Takes shifts whenever she can.

21:19.279 --> 21:22.157
You know, she does everything
to make that a special night.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.203
Day comes, we get all dressed up...

21:28.705 --> 21:30.707
but we never even
make it to the restaurant.

21:32.000 --> 21:32.918
Why not?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.632
Because ten minutes
after he takes that picture,

21:38.715 --> 21:40.592
they get into such a huge
fucking blowout

21:40.675 --> 21:44.596
that she kicks him out of the house
and they don't speak again for two years.

21:46.932 --> 21:48.725
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.231
Yeah.

21:59.569 --> 22:02.739
That was the last time
we ever tried to celebrate Father's Day.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.340
Oh, Mr. Garnet.

22:20.549 --> 22:23.426
-I told him you were unavailable.
-No, no. No, that's okay.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.387
Kevin.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.223
Rayburn. Kevin Rayburn.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.269
-Kevin? Yeah, hey. How are you?
-Hey. I'm good.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.729
I'm sorry. I was--
I was just on my way out.

22:34.813 --> 22:37.691
-Why don't you talk to Rachel?
-I'm sorry to stop by like this.

22:37.899 --> 22:38.900
I'm in a time crunch.

22:38.984 --> 22:42.696
You told me if I ever got a business plan
together that I should come see you.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.573
I-- I got a business plan.

22:46.616 --> 22:47.867
Sure, why not?

22:49.119 --> 22:51.830
I'll meet you at the restaurant.
Go on without me, okay?

22:53.498 --> 22:55.417
-Give you ten minutes.
-That's all I need.

23:02.173 --> 23:04.217
So, you've given up
on the mixed-use marina?

23:04.801 --> 23:06.761
Well, I've decided to scale down,
you know?

23:06.845 --> 23:09.389
Keep it simple,
wait for the market to correct itself.

23:09.472 --> 23:10.682
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

23:11.516 --> 23:13.768
You're sitting on, what? A couple acres?

23:14.227 --> 23:16.938
Two-point-six. All of it prime waterfront.

23:17.647 --> 23:18.940
You zoned for commercial?

23:19.399 --> 23:22.819
I have a variance for light industrial,
and my family, they--

23:22.902 --> 23:26.323
They know all the commissioners,
so it's-- It's-- It's good to go.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.699
-It's all in there.
-Okay.

23:29.284 --> 23:30.619
Have a seat.

23:33.788 --> 23:37.000
-I think we might be able to do something.
-That's awesome. Thank you.

23:37.167 --> 23:40.879
It's a pretty straightforward proposition.
I'm looking for a partner to...

23:41.755 --> 23:44.591
To invest, and we split the business
fifty-fifty.

23:45.925 --> 23:46.885
Well...

23:47.636 --> 23:51.598
with a site like yours, Kevin,
that's not really what I do.

23:52.390 --> 23:55.352
-What do you mean?
-Well, I wouldn't want a partner.

23:56.978 --> 23:59.856
You wouldn't want a partner?
What--? What would you want?

24:00.148 --> 24:01.650
I'd just buy it outright.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.151
Oh, no, no.

24:03.401 --> 24:04.611
It's not for sale.

24:06.655 --> 24:09.491
Well, I-- I don't understand.

24:11.534 --> 24:15.747
The prognosis here is not good, Kevin.
You're about to lose a lot of money.

24:16.039 --> 24:18.083
Maybe. Yeah. Okay.

24:18.166 --> 24:22.003
So, why drive all the way up
here and go through this song and dance

24:22.087 --> 24:24.047
-about how desperate you are--?
-I am.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.382
I imagine that you are.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.759
-You need a solution.
-I'm aware of that.

24:28.051 --> 24:29.469
Which I'm offering you.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.390
Um...

24:34.724 --> 24:37.602
Yeah. Thank you for your time. I...

24:37.686 --> 24:40.480
But I-- I'm not selling my boatyard.
It's not for sale.

24:40.689 --> 24:42.691
-I just can't do it.
-Why not?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.000
Ms. Ortiz?

25:02.585 --> 25:04.295
-Hi.
-Hello.

25:05.922 --> 25:07.465
Thank you for coming, Detective.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.634
Yes.

25:11.052 --> 25:13.805
I didn't know what to do.
Your sister won't return my calls.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.059
I'm sorry,
how is it you know my sister?

25:18.893 --> 25:20.353
She didn't tell you?

25:23.273 --> 25:26.234
-I'm sorry to drag you into this.
-No, no, that's all right.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.945
I'm just curious as to why
you two are in touch. I--

25:29.320 --> 25:30.780
She reached out to me.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.616
I assumed it was for your campaign.

25:37.412 --> 25:41.499
I imagine you had given some information
to Meg about the assault, yes?

25:42.167 --> 25:43.001
Yes.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.211
I went out on a limb for her.

25:45.754 --> 25:46.755
For both of you.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.675
What is it that you would like us
to do for you?

25:51.760 --> 25:53.344
Tell the rest of the story.

25:54.095 --> 25:57.140
Expose the deal that my ex-husband
made with Marco Diaz.

26:03.021 --> 26:05.231
What exactly did that deal entail?

26:07.108 --> 26:10.904
Fifty minutes with the moderator,
ten with open Q&A, no cross-talk.

26:11.863 --> 26:12.947
Notes are permissible.

26:13.907 --> 26:15.950
Sure, if you think
your candidate needs them.

26:16.034 --> 26:18.369
I would've thought
Aguirre could think on his feet.

26:22.332 --> 26:26.169
Police procedure, crime statistics,
budget. Those are the only open topics.

26:29.506 --> 26:30.507
Agreed.

26:31.966 --> 26:36.763
No mention of any unsubstantiated
domestic abuse allegations.

26:38.723 --> 26:41.100
Doesn't that fall under crime statistics?

26:42.685 --> 26:46.064
Your camp released this steaming
pile of shit, and we all know it.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.483
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Not a problem.

26:48.650 --> 26:52.570
-We're finishing up here anyway.
-I just wanted to say hello, Meg.

26:53.988 --> 26:56.199
-Sheriff Aguirre, it's a pleasure.
-Likewise.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.619
Thank you for coming in the other day
and talking with Detective Diaz.

27:00.537 --> 27:01.538
You were a big help.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.040
I'm glad to hear that.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.836
Burt, I wanna go over a few things.

27:08.044 --> 27:09.003
Sure.

27:09.796 --> 27:10.964
Miss Rayburn.

27:32.694 --> 27:33.987
What are you doing here?

27:35.154 --> 27:38.032
You want me to go in there
and tell them everything I know?

27:39.659 --> 27:40.869
Because I will.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.746
Oh...

27:43.830 --> 27:45.248
That look.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.876
What, you people really think
you're the victims here?

27:49.669 --> 27:51.212
Let me tell you something, honey.

27:51.421 --> 27:55.008
I've been on your end of this hook
more times than I care to admit,

27:55.091 --> 27:57.135
and it sucks. Oh, yeah, it sucks.

27:59.929 --> 28:03.099
But we both know... how you got here,

28:03.182 --> 28:05.476
and it ain't because
you're exemplary individuals.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.315
I just need one more day.

28:23.995 --> 28:27.332
Now, be very-- Be very, very careful.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.209
Okay?

28:30.418 --> 28:34.631
Because 24 hours from right now,
one way or another...

28:35.924 --> 28:37.550
this conversation ends.

28:55.151 --> 28:57.153
Ninety days. Not that long.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.365
So, what happens to the restaurant now?

29:06.162 --> 29:09.749
-I mean, you have to do something.
-Like what?

29:10.041 --> 29:12.919
I don't know, but without the money,
they'll shut it down.

29:13.002 --> 29:13.962
Who cares?

29:14.462 --> 29:17.090
-I do.
-I don't.

29:20.635 --> 29:24.222
So, that's it?
You're just... giving up now?

29:27.475 --> 29:29.769
You told me it was gonna be
different this time.

29:31.896 --> 29:35.483
You said that we were gonna do it together
and you were gonna teach me.

29:43.116 --> 29:47.120
-All that shit about being your sous chef.
-Yeah, well...

29:51.624 --> 29:52.583
I lied.

30:02.010 --> 30:04.721
Why don't you just
ask your parents for the money?

30:11.060 --> 30:12.937
-You want me to ask them?
-No.

30:13.104 --> 30:13.980
No, I don't.

30:14.397 --> 30:17.358
I absolutely do not.
I want you to stay away from them.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.739
Why? I'm their grandson.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.285
You are a fucking embarrassment to them.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.044
Hey.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.713
Don't come back here anymore.

30:39.964 --> 30:41.966
Stay the fuck away from me.

30:42.467 --> 30:43.551
Okay?

30:48.514 --> 30:50.058
Why are you doing this?

31:23.424 --> 31:25.927
- Where's your water?
- It's-- The bag.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.221
-You put it in here?
-Yeah.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.807
We have time for breakfast?

31:32.475 --> 31:34.185
I should get back to the office.

31:35.144 --> 31:36.813
-Tonight?
-Tonight.

31:38.231 --> 31:40.149
-I have to take this, okay?
-Okay.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.945
-Diaz.
-<i>Hello, Detective. This is Alec Moros.</i>

31:44.028 --> 31:45.071
<i>I got your message.</i>

31:45.530 --> 31:46.697
Mr. Moros.

31:47.115 --> 31:50.410
-Thanks for calling me back.
-<i>Sure. What exactly is this regarding?</i>

31:51.119 --> 31:54.664
I have some routine questions on a case
that I'm working on down here.

31:54.747 --> 31:57.333
-I was hoping you could help.
-<i>I'm not a suspect, am I?</i>

31:57.959 --> 31:59.627
No, no, you're not a suspect.

32:00.711 --> 32:03.464
-Can you confirm a few dates for me?
-<i>I can try.</i>

32:34.954 --> 32:37.790
If I sell this place,
he's gonna just tear it down.

32:41.502 --> 32:43.629
It would be his to do what he wants.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.381
I know.

32:49.427 --> 32:54.849
Still, I said no so quick. It was weird.
It was like I wasn't even thinking.

32:55.516 --> 32:57.393
It was like some kind of instinct.

33:03.816 --> 33:06.152
Then he asked me why I didn't wanna sell.

33:08.821 --> 33:11.032
The thing is, I didn't have an answer.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.626
I think it's because my dad gave me
the money to start this place,

33:21.709 --> 33:24.670
and all I ever wanted to do
was to make him proud.

33:28.716 --> 33:32.386
And deep down I felt like
I always had to live up to John...

33:32.470 --> 33:34.847
and not be a fuck-up like Danny.

33:40.937 --> 33:43.147
This place was a way for me to do both.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.984
That's-- That's a lot of pressure
to put on yourself.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.577
Maybe it's time for a change.

34:03.084 --> 34:06.045
So, this guy wasn't in town
when she said he was?

34:06.254 --> 34:08.130
No, he was not.

34:09.674 --> 34:10.633
Hmm...

34:11.425 --> 34:12.969
This is getting interesting.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.597
Any idea why she'd lie about that?

34:16.806 --> 34:19.100
-Not yet.
-Think she was helping Danny?

34:19.433 --> 34:20.560
Could be.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.021
Something was going on that night.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.525
When this first started, Marco...

34:28.901 --> 34:31.028
I know you think
that I was playing politics.

34:31.571 --> 34:32.989
I did, not anymore.

34:35.783 --> 34:38.995
This is a respected family. Okay?

34:39.078 --> 34:41.581
So anything you do
is strictly by the book.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.708
I understand.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.252
And if you need any more resources,
you let me know.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.671
-Whatever the department can provide.
-Well...

34:49.839 --> 34:53.884
there's something that I wanna do,
but it's, uh... It's delicate.

35:00.057 --> 35:01.142
What are you thinking?

35:05.438 --> 35:09.525
I passed on Kevin's information
to several of my associates.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.527
Thank you for doing that.

35:11.736 --> 35:15.448
I also called the bank,
did a little digging on my own.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.283
Yeah, he's a little underwater.

35:17.366 --> 35:23.289
That's putting it mildly.
But his infrastructure appears sound.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.333
I was happy to see that.

35:25.916 --> 35:28.961
Uh... How would you feel
about making an introduction?

35:30.129 --> 35:33.299
-You wanna sit down with Kevin?
-I'd like to hear what he's thinking.

35:33.924 --> 35:35.426
Sure. Sure. I would love that.

35:35.635 --> 35:37.136
-Yeah.
-It'd be great.

35:39.764 --> 35:41.432
There's one other thing.

35:43.184 --> 35:44.268
There's this guy...

35:44.894 --> 35:48.230
who used to do some shady stuff
with my brother that passed away.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.484
-Danny.
-Yeah.

35:52.652 --> 35:56.072
Anyway, this guy is trying
to shake down my family to keep

35:56.155 --> 35:58.074
what he knows from getting out.

35:58.741 --> 36:02.078
Now, this kind of crap happens
all the time. I see it every campaign.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.792
He's a liar, but he's a nuisance.

36:08.376 --> 36:11.921
Listen, think of this
as the cost of doing business.

36:12.922 --> 36:15.257
You know, there's a way
to handle the accounting.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.135
No one will pay any attention to it.

36:22.473 --> 36:23.849
We should pay him?

36:24.058 --> 36:26.727
With the clear understanding
that if he doesn't go away...

36:30.272 --> 36:31.607
he'll be dealt with.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.616
Why the fuck did you
take her to our place?

36:41.409 --> 36:42.451
What do you care?

36:47.248 --> 36:50.209
I don't know. I'm a private person.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.838
You know?
She doesn't have to know all our business.

36:55.715 --> 36:57.383
Think she doesn't know what you are?

36:57.591 --> 37:00.386
I'm your fucking mother,
so don't be so disrespectful.

37:03.931 --> 37:06.600
What did it say about
when they're gonna evict us?

37:07.143 --> 37:08.144
End of the month.

37:10.521 --> 37:11.814
God.

37:13.149 --> 37:15.109
All right, I'll figure it out.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.743
There's something else.

37:26.579 --> 37:27.663
What?

37:28.539 --> 37:29.999
She wants to talk to you.

37:31.584 --> 37:32.543
To me?

37:36.714 --> 37:39.842
-Why?
-I don't know.

37:40.801 --> 37:42.428
She wants us to come over there.

37:44.722 --> 37:45.765
Oh.

37:47.850 --> 37:50.060
Well, that's interesting.

38:07.995 --> 38:09.830
Why didn't my dad ask them for help?

38:11.540 --> 38:13.209
He did, a bunch of times.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.294
No, I mean with the restaurant.

38:17.922 --> 38:19.507
He never even told them about it.

38:21.467 --> 38:25.137
None of them knew anything. All he
had to do was just ask for more money.

38:27.264 --> 38:28.224
Baby...

38:30.851 --> 38:33.646
Look, I know you're
getting to know these people

38:33.729 --> 38:35.815
and you kind of like them and everything,

38:35.940 --> 38:37.983
but you're not seeing
your dad's side of it.

38:38.943 --> 38:40.236
Because he was an asshole.

38:41.153 --> 38:42.863
Watch your fucking mouth.

38:46.700 --> 38:47.743
Hey.

38:49.537 --> 38:52.414
When it came to the restaurant,
Danny was only thinking of you.

38:52.581 --> 38:54.250
What's that supposed to mean?

38:56.126 --> 38:57.461
It doesn't mean anything.

38:59.588 --> 39:00.923
Nothing.

39:01.465 --> 39:02.591
Forget it.

39:19.984 --> 39:20.860
Man.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.445
You own all this?

39:23.529 --> 39:26.282
-Yes.
-It's like the fricking Navy here.

39:27.616 --> 39:28.868
Wow!

39:30.411 --> 39:33.372
-Hinckley T55.
-Queen of the Fleet.

39:33.455 --> 39:34.748
She is a beauty.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.501
My nephew in Long Point
is getting married.

39:37.793 --> 39:41.380
Kid's not much into boats, so I figured
this would jump-start his interest.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.090
You think?

39:46.677 --> 39:49.513
I guess you vetted me pretty good
before I came out here, huh?

39:49.847 --> 39:51.056
Yes, I did.

39:52.516 --> 39:54.351
I don't wanna bullshit you, Mr. Gilbert.

39:54.435 --> 39:57.396
I-- I made a lot of big mistakes
with my business...

39:58.105 --> 40:02.318
mostly because I... I think
I was trying to be something I'm not.

40:05.112 --> 40:08.449
I think I just started to lose sight
of what I really wanted to do,

40:08.532 --> 40:10.200
which is just fix boats.

40:10.868 --> 40:12.786
I fucking love boats.

40:13.287 --> 40:15.122
It's the only thing I'm really good at.

40:16.373 --> 40:19.376
Your sister says you're looking
for somebody to buy you out.

40:19.460 --> 40:22.504
Yeah. I'm just trying to simplify things.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.050
You sound like someone
who's spent a lifetime honing a craft.

40:26.300 --> 40:27.885
That's worth more than you think.

40:28.052 --> 40:30.846
Oh, I'm-- I'm in pretty deep here.
I just wanna get out.

40:31.847 --> 40:35.935
Yeah, well, how about I send over
the man who does my day-to-day?

40:36.018 --> 40:38.812
He'll check out your operation,
appraise the yard.

40:39.355 --> 40:43.442
See if we can come up with a number
that makes sense to you and I both.

40:43.817 --> 40:45.361
I really appreciate that.

40:47.404 --> 40:49.615
Let me know what I can do
to help with the sale.

40:49.698 --> 40:51.575
Yeah. Okay.

40:52.284 --> 40:54.995
They brought him to Sarasota
and I haven't heard a thing.

40:55.079 --> 40:56.205
Well, I don't know.

40:56.705 --> 40:59.917
Listen, that's what they told me,
so don't--

41:01.085 --> 41:03.087
Mike, I gotta call you back.

41:04.838 --> 41:07.883
-Why are you here? Everything all right?
-No, it's not.

41:08.092 --> 41:09.802
-What's wrong?
-I want my necklace.

41:10.219 --> 41:12.012
Mom said I could have it back.

41:12.221 --> 41:14.056
Oh, Jesus, Janey.

41:14.264 --> 41:16.684
Look, Danny didn't threaten me, okay?

41:16.892 --> 41:19.061
You thought he was dangerous,
but you're wrong.

41:19.269 --> 41:21.981
Listen to me, there are
things that you can't understand.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.775
I don't care what bullshit happened
between you guys,

41:24.984 --> 41:29.279
but he's my uncle and that's the only
present he ever gave me. I want it back.

41:29.488 --> 41:31.365
This conversation's over.
We'll talk at home.

41:31.573 --> 41:34.827
-Why can't we talk about this now?
-Because you're leaving now. Marco.

41:36.245 --> 41:37.371
Hi, Janey.

41:37.955 --> 41:39.331
Hey.

41:45.212 --> 41:48.382
-How'd it go with Meg and Kevin?
-They were both very helpful.

41:49.008 --> 41:50.009
Good.

41:50.801 --> 41:53.178
But I'm gonna have to sit down
with you again, John.

41:54.763 --> 41:57.933
-And I wanna do it today.
-Sit down?

41:58.684 --> 42:01.020
Yeah. We still have some questions.

42:01.395 --> 42:02.646
"We" being?

42:04.982 --> 42:09.570
We're just trying to figure out where
Danny was the days before he died, so...

42:12.906 --> 42:14.491
We all want the same thing, John.

42:16.118 --> 42:17.369
Clarity.

42:19.079 --> 42:20.998
I understand that, Marco.

42:21.206 --> 42:24.334
Just tell me when you wanna do this.
I'll give you everything I got.

42:24.501 --> 42:26.003
I appreciate that.

42:39.349 --> 42:41.852
-There you are.
-Thanks.

42:43.145 --> 42:44.104
Thanks.

42:50.194 --> 42:51.820
So, you saw our place?

42:52.780 --> 42:53.947
I did.

42:56.867 --> 42:59.703
It hasn't always been like that for us,
you know.

42:59.912 --> 43:02.289
There was a while back
when I was doing pretty good.

43:05.459 --> 43:08.087
What? There was a while back
I was doing pretty good.

43:10.589 --> 43:13.383
We all go through rough patches.

43:17.513 --> 43:22.142
When you, uh...
first came to see me, I was...

43:23.060 --> 43:24.561
I was a little cold to you.

43:25.145 --> 43:27.189
-Yeah, you were.
-Mom.

43:29.650 --> 43:33.028
Look, if this is some sort of apology...

43:34.404 --> 43:35.823
it's just a little late.

43:39.284 --> 43:41.370
Just let her talk.

43:48.961 --> 43:53.674
I wish I could go back
and change our history,

43:53.882 --> 43:56.802
but life doesn't work like that.

43:58.345 --> 43:59.930
Nope, it doesn't.

44:03.976 --> 44:06.186
But maybe we could all start over.

44:09.773 --> 44:11.358
What does that mean?

44:13.318 --> 44:15.654
You're right.
It's too late for an apology, and...

44:16.989 --> 44:19.158
that's not what I'm offering.

44:19.366 --> 44:21.493
Then what are you offering?

44:23.370 --> 44:25.873
You said you needed a place to stay.

44:27.833 --> 44:31.420
And it's clear that you've got no home
to go back to.

44:34.506 --> 44:35.799
What about it?

44:36.300 --> 44:39.469
Well, we got plenty of room here.

44:54.776 --> 44:56.820
I just want to do right by you two.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.450
And I want to do right by Danny.

45:08.290 --> 45:09.124
You ready?

45:14.421 --> 45:16.590
Come on, it's just you and me.
What do you need?

45:17.591 --> 45:22.095
I need to nail down a timeline.
Aguirre won't be satisfied until I do.

45:23.764 --> 45:28.435
-Why doesn't Aguirre read the transcripts?
-He's read them. So have I.

45:29.853 --> 45:33.440
John, there's...
There's been some developments.

45:34.775 --> 45:36.360
What developments?

45:37.736 --> 45:41.490
We'll get to that.
Let's start at the beginning, okay?

45:46.662 --> 45:48.455
The night of the Red Reef Motel,

45:48.664 --> 45:52.542
Danny kills one of Lowry's guys, and
then he goes to your family's inn, right?

45:53.168 --> 45:54.294
That's right.

45:54.878 --> 45:56.588
And that didn't seem weird to you?

45:56.797 --> 45:59.883
That Danny kills one of Lowry's guys,
he knows Lowry is after him.

46:00.092 --> 46:02.886
If I was Danny, I'd wanna
get the fuck out of Dodge, right?

46:03.095 --> 46:05.305
I wouldn't wanna go and hang out
with my family.

46:08.433 --> 46:10.310
Unless I was coming to you for help.

46:12.270 --> 46:16.692
Didn't ask you for money, for
a place to stay, protection? I mean...

46:17.317 --> 46:19.820
-No.
-Then why'd he go there, John?

46:22.406 --> 46:24.658
I don't have an answer for you. I'm sorry.

46:26.827 --> 46:32.207
So, the next day, you didn't speak to him,
you didn't see him, nothing?

46:33.041 --> 46:37.004
No, the next day I was in the hospital.
I had my situation with my heart.

46:37.212 --> 46:40.257
You were released later on that night.
Right?

46:41.550 --> 46:43.385
Yes.

46:43.593 --> 46:47.097
So, just to be clear,
the last time that you saw Danny alive

46:47.305 --> 46:50.475
was that night at your family's inn.

46:53.729 --> 46:55.063
That's right.

46:56.273 --> 46:57.607
What about Meg?

47:00.235 --> 47:01.862
What about Meg?

47:02.738 --> 47:04.740
Do you know who Alec Moros is?

47:06.533 --> 47:07.451
No.

47:07.826 --> 47:10.871
Alec Moros is the guy that Meg was fucking
while we were together.

47:11.371 --> 47:15.667
Supposedly, he was at her house the night
before you and Kevin drove to Miami.

47:16.918 --> 47:18.253
-Okay.
-No, not okay

47:18.462 --> 47:20.881
because I called him personally.
He wasn't here.

47:21.089 --> 47:23.842
He was in New York. Meg lied.
Why do you think she lied?

47:26.470 --> 47:30.057
You know what? To me, it sounds personal.
I think you'd better talk to her.

47:30.265 --> 47:34.895
I think there was somebody in that house,
not Alec Moros, somebody else.

47:38.356 --> 47:39.566
Danny.

47:40.567 --> 47:41.860
That's crazy.

47:42.944 --> 47:45.363
I thought you didn't know where Danny was.

47:45.989 --> 47:47.157
I didn't.

47:47.866 --> 47:51.119
Then why are you so sure that Danny
wasn't at Meg's house that night?

47:53.789 --> 47:55.290
Cut to the chase.

47:56.291 --> 47:58.835
Danny dodged a lot of bullets,
didn't he, John?

48:00.670 --> 48:03.131
How did Danny know to get the drugs
out of your family's inn

48:03.215 --> 48:04.466
before the DEA got there?

48:05.801 --> 48:10.597
How did he get the drop on a professional
killer with a gun at the Red Reef Inn?

48:12.057 --> 48:13.892
How did Danny disappear to Miami

48:14.101 --> 48:18.563
when every cop in the county and Lowry and
every one of Lowry's guys was after him?

48:18.772 --> 48:20.774
I don't know, Marco.
What are you thinking?

48:22.025 --> 48:27.572
I'm thinking that you, Meg and Kevin
helped Danny get away with murder.

48:30.742 --> 48:33.745
It would explain what Danny was doing
at Meg's house that night.

48:37.874 --> 48:39.334
If he was...

48:40.293 --> 48:42.838
it throws the whole timeline
out the fucking window

48:43.046 --> 48:46.091
and we're back to square one
with the whole Danny investigation.

48:50.428 --> 48:53.348
You knew that was Danny's voice
in that DEA wiretap.

48:55.016 --> 48:58.812
You knew that was Danny
in that gas-can video that we saw.

49:00.856 --> 49:02.440
And you didn't say shit.

49:07.988 --> 49:09.447
What did you teach me, John?

49:14.911 --> 49:20.292
What do you do when your gut is
telling you shit just ain't fucking right?

49:44.107 --> 49:48.653
I don't believe your story, just so
you know, and nobody else is going to.

49:49.613 --> 49:51.781
But I'm betting you
brought the money anyhow.

49:59.456 --> 50:01.041
Because you're a nuisance.

50:02.167 --> 50:04.920
This isn't worth my time.
My family's been through enough.

50:05.921 --> 50:07.547
Now, leave us the fuck alone.

50:16.264 --> 50:20.060
You know, I gotta say,
I really admire you. I really do.

50:22.687 --> 50:26.691
Because I got a little sister, Felicia,
and, man, I love her to death,

50:26.775 --> 50:30.487
but there's no fucking way
she'd step up for me to protect me

50:30.695 --> 50:33.240
the way you've been
protecting your brother.

50:33.323 --> 50:37.911
I'm not the only one who wants my brother
to win this campaign. There are others.

50:40.080 --> 50:41.581
Powerful people.

50:44.292 --> 50:45.877
And if you don't disappear...

50:47.003 --> 50:49.422
things could get really ugly.

51:04.854 --> 51:07.607
I wanna talk about the Red Reef Motel
a little bit more.

51:10.193 --> 51:13.905
Have you been back there
since the night of the murder?

51:16.491 --> 51:17.534
Once.

51:19.869 --> 51:21.538
Why is that?

51:22.539 --> 51:26.334
Someone tried to kill Danny. I'm a cop,
I wanted answers. What do you think?

51:26.543 --> 51:29.921
-Did we come up with the same answers?
-I don't know. Did we?

51:30.130 --> 51:31.840
There's no way Danny could get the drop

51:31.923 --> 51:35.260
on a professional killer with a gun
in that room unless he had help.

51:37.595 --> 51:41.141
-There was somebody else there with him.
-Well, that's a theory, isn't it?

51:43.518 --> 51:46.104
How did you know
that Danny was at the Red Reef?

51:46.313 --> 51:48.648
-I already told you all this.
-Tell me again.

51:50.108 --> 51:51.609
Chelsea O'Bannon.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.531
She told you that one of Lowry's guys
was after Danny.

51:56.740 --> 51:58.033
And she was right.

51:58.241 --> 52:01.828
So you went there, you looked for him,
but you couldn't find him, right?

52:03.580 --> 52:04.664
That's right.

52:05.206 --> 52:09.085
Lowry's guy did, and so did
whoever helped Danny kill Lowry's guy.

52:11.004 --> 52:13.048
Where you going with this theory, Marco?

52:14.507 --> 52:17.302
This is me talking about
that feeling in my gut.

52:17.510 --> 52:18.887
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

52:19.095 --> 52:21.097
Because it sounds like you're saying

52:21.306 --> 52:25.352
that I maybe tried to help Danny escape
after he killed someone.

52:25.560 --> 52:29.481
And it also kind of sounds like
I helped Danny kill someone.

52:31.149 --> 52:34.110
He wasn't there
when I got to the motel, I left.

52:34.819 --> 52:38.448
I call you and I tell you that there's
a murder at the Red Reef Motel.

52:39.282 --> 52:41.534
You know Danny is staying there.

52:41.868 --> 52:45.121
You know Lowry sent somebody there
to kill Danny.

52:46.873 --> 52:50.293
How the fuck don't you ask me,
"Hey, Marco...

52:50.377 --> 52:53.088
is it my brother that was killed there?"

52:57.717 --> 52:59.386
It doesn't add up.

53:03.431 --> 53:05.266
You know what doesn't add up, Marco?

53:18.822 --> 53:21.783
Why you let Aguirre
beat the shit out of his wife.

53:24.452 --> 53:26.788
You were the responding officer,
weren't you?

53:30.875 --> 53:34.963
You buried that incident report.
One month after that...

53:35.588 --> 53:37.215
Aguirre gave you a job.

53:37.674 --> 53:39.384
You're fucking brushing me back.

53:39.592 --> 53:43.012
And let me tell you something,
that story, it's out there.

53:43.221 --> 53:46.349
People want me to use that to win
an election. I haven't touched it.

53:48.935 --> 53:51.729
-Because I've been protecting you.
-Yeah?

53:51.938 --> 53:55.483
So, when you sit in here and you try
to spin Aguirre's political agenda

53:55.692 --> 53:59.070
into some bullshit theory,
I don't have to sit here and take it.

53:59.279 --> 54:04.659
Let me tell you something,
my family needs this to end now.

54:06.244 --> 54:09.789
Then your family
should start telling the truth now.

55:49.889 --> 55:51.558
Meg told me...

55:53.059 --> 55:55.562
how your mom made
all three of you lie to the police

55:55.645 --> 55:58.231
when your dad beat the fuck
out of Danny.

55:59.232 --> 56:03.152
Lying to police to protect your family,
is that what you're doing now, John?

56:03.361 --> 56:06.239
-Don't go there.
-What is it with you people?

56:07.282 --> 56:10.660
You guys think you could fucking lie.
You think that you could cheat.

56:10.868 --> 56:13.871
You think you could fuck people over
and get away with it?

56:14.080 --> 56:16.541
Is that what this is about?
Meg hurt your feelings?

56:18.334 --> 56:22.797
Listen, I'm really sorry you can't stop
Meg from fucking around on you.

56:23.673 --> 56:25.300
Don't fucking twist this.

56:25.508 --> 56:31.347
But you come in here with Aguirre's story
that he handed you, to cram full of facts.

56:32.515 --> 56:34.934
But the problem is, Marco...

56:37.186 --> 56:41.107
the facts don't fit. They just don't.

56:43.568 --> 56:45.028
Don't you wanna know?

56:45.737 --> 56:49.949
-Know what?
-Know who the fuck killed your brother?

56:51.576 --> 56:53.620
Wayne Lowry killed my brother.

56:54.996 --> 56:58.166
You and I both know
that Wayne Lowry didn't pull that trigger.

56:59.083 --> 57:02.295
And whoever he hired is out there.

57:07.050 --> 57:10.720
The John Rayburn that I know
would wanna know the truth.

57:16.225 --> 57:22.774
The John Rayburn I know would hunt his
brother's killer to the ends of the earth.

57:24.192 --> 57:25.985
Unless...

57:36.913 --> 57:41.626
Marco, if you've got a case,
go ahead and fucking make it.

57:43.586 --> 57:48.091
Otherwise, you're gonna stay away
from me and my family.
