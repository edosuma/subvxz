00:03.003 --> 00:05.173
NARRATOR: The shark's oily liver
 keeps it buoyant

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
and balanced in the water.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.375
Hmm.

00:09.943 --> 00:13.081
Okay, I just want to reconfirm
your yard-sale requests.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.516
Grandma -- anything with
Garfield on it.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.051
Eddie --
used gold grille.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.019
Emery -- old silk ties.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.654
Evan -- horse stickers.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.889
Unicorns okay, too?

00:21.922 --> 00:23.391
As long as it has
four hooves

00:23.424 --> 00:24.992
and a beautiful face,
I want it.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.262
**

00:30.131 --> 00:32.100
Why do you need to wear
my fishing vest

00:32.133 --> 00:33.667
to go yard-sale shopping?

00:33.701 --> 00:37.371
I put different dollar amounts
in various pockets.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.240
When a seller
gives me a price,

00:39.273 --> 00:42.243
I reach into a pocket with
a lesser amount, pull it out,

00:42.276 --> 00:44.044
and act like
it's all I have to offer.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.114
"$4 for a Lite-Brite?

00:46.147 --> 00:48.549
But I only have $3."

00:48.582 --> 00:49.417
(chuckles)

00:51.252 --> 00:55.223
Oh, um,
I'm holding those for...

00:55.256 --> 00:56.924
(clears throat)

01:00.228 --> 01:01.462
* Fresh off the boat

01:01.495 --> 01:03.264
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:03.297 --> 01:05.465
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:05.498 --> 01:06.734
* Fresh off the boat

01:06.767 --> 01:08.969
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:09.002 --> 01:10.604
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:10.638 --> 01:13.441
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:14.642 --> 01:16.544
**

01:16.577 --> 01:19.280
(sighs)
Well, this is a disaster.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.948
Your mother and I
are back and forth

01:20.981 --> 01:22.550
at each other's house
so often,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.585
it's hard to remember
whose Tupperware is whose.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.787
Well, let's assume yours

01:26.820 --> 01:29.457
are the ones
with the spaghetti stains.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.527
It looks like
the rest are ours.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.565
(door opens)

01:37.598 --> 01:38.432
Uh...

01:38.466 --> 01:39.767
Hey, Nicole.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.735
Looks like you had a productive
week with your mom.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.103
Yeah, we went to
the outlet mall.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.505
I bought a ton
of tube socks.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.607
I'm gonna cut the feet off
and wear them as tops.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.908
(chuckles)
That's creative.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.277
Did you also work on
your science project?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.478
(sighs)

01:50.511 --> 01:51.912
Nicole, the plan was,

01:51.945 --> 01:53.447
you were going to
finish it at Sarah's.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.083
I know, but we were just
having so much fun.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.084
Right, Mom?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.786
Wait. She's here?

01:58.819 --> 02:00.588
(dramatic music plays)
(gasps)

02:00.621 --> 02:01.855
Hey, hussy.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.324
Surprised
to see you standing.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.992
Between all your
digging for gold

02:05.025 --> 02:06.860
and those fake clangers
on your chest,

02:06.894 --> 02:08.429
your back must be
killing you.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.930
I'm gonna use
the master bathroom.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.166
You remember --
the one I had re-tiled

02:12.200 --> 02:14.868
while you were slappin' cakes
with my husband.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.708
I'm glad she's
going to the bathroom

02:20.741 --> 02:23.177
because her mouth
belongs in the toilet.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.779
**

02:25.813 --> 02:27.181
(doorbell rings)

02:28.682 --> 02:30.484
Sarah came
into the house today.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.552
McLachlan?

02:31.585 --> 02:33.854
No. Marvin's ex-wife,
Nicole's mother.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.056
Well, if Sarah McLachlan
ever does come over,

02:36.089 --> 02:37.891
tell her her new album
is so great.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.329
Anyway, she had Nicole
for a whole week,

02:41.362 --> 02:43.397
and they didn't
get her homework done,

02:43.431 --> 02:44.798
so now I'm scrambling

02:44.832 --> 02:46.900
to help her come up with
a science project.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.370
Did you tell
Marvin about it?
I tried.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.405
So, Sarah came
in the house today,

02:51.439 --> 02:53.807
just barged in
like she still lives here.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.409
She is always rude to me,

02:55.443 --> 02:57.811
and she is not responsible
when it comes to Nicole.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.547
I really think you need to
step up and...

02:59.580 --> 03:01.048
Sounds like
you just need

03:01.081 --> 03:03.351
to deal with Sarah yourself,
confront her.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.553
Mnh, it's fine.
I just needed to vent.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.757
Well, I should head out.
I'll call you later.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.760
I have to go work on
Nicole's science experiment.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.996
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in high school again,

03:16.029 --> 03:17.431
minus my dreads.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.933
Sharks do not normally
 hunt humans.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.535
When they do attack people,

03:21.569 --> 03:24.071
it is usually a case of
 mistaken identity.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.840
This is exactly what sharks
want us to think.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.076
When we return,
 the secret mating habits

03:29.109 --> 03:30.511
of the whale shark.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.413
Eddie, can you change
the channel to PBS?

03:32.446 --> 03:35.015
Emery and I want to see what
Julia Child is baking today.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.750
You crazy?
You heard the man.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.952
They about to reveal
some sex secrets.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.221
Shh! Eddie...

03:41.255 --> 03:43.624
NARRATOR: Go everywhere you want
 with the ease and comfort

03:43.657 --> 03:45.726
of the Jazzy 1115 Power Chair.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.496
The Jazzy turns on a dime
 making it ideal for...

03:50.498 --> 03:52.099
Get out in the sunshine,

03:52.132 --> 03:54.067
cruise the neighborhood,
 visit your friends...

03:54.101 --> 03:57.137
**

04:15.088 --> 04:18.459
Yes. A child.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.428
I'd like to talk about
this $7 blender.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.830
I'll give you $4.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.299
Well, since you're wearing
olive green --

04:25.333 --> 04:27.601
my favorite color --
okay.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.603
$4 for the blender,
please.

04:29.637 --> 04:33.140
Oh, shucks.
But I only have $3.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.275
Tell you what --
I'll give you $3 for it,

04:35.309 --> 04:37.010
and I'll pretend
I didn't notice

04:37.044 --> 04:38.846
the calcium stains
in the pitcher.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.481
You're scaring me.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.783
I'm gonna have to
check with my dad.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.819
My Aunt Judy,
who recently passed away,

04:45.853 --> 04:47.688
had this exact same vacuum.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.657
I know she would have
wanted me to have it...

04:49.690 --> 04:51.525
offered to me
at a lower price.

04:51.559 --> 04:54.027
(voice breaking) It's just
who my Aunt Judy was.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.162
Okay, okay.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.997
I'll let you have it
for $15.

04:57.030 --> 05:00.133
Oh, thank you.
Thank you!

05:06.740 --> 05:08.175
(sighs)

05:08.208 --> 05:11.445
My dad says you don't look like
you're worth the hassle.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.713
$3 is fine.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.983
Your dad is a smart man.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.353
And that'll be $20
for the Joan Baez record.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.892
Oh. I -- I thought it
came with the blender.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.899
Nice negotiating.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.134
Did you use Visine for the tears
or onion powder?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.536
Oh, they're real.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.505
I think about the bargains
I missed in the past,

05:37.538 --> 05:38.839
get me
in the right headspace.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.208
And then,
to get the tears flowing,

05:41.241 --> 05:43.143
I think about
all the kittens that died

05:43.176 --> 05:45.045
during the filming of
"Milo and Otis."

05:45.078 --> 05:47.214
I like you.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.516
Mm.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.318
Ew. Eddie used
the same knife,

05:51.351 --> 05:53.821
and now there's mayo
in the mustard jar.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.189
I don't know why
you're being all precious.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.791
I licked
both your bread slices.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.929
I'm in a rush, son.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.431
I don't want to miss
 any of the shark marathon.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.899
You know, I was thinking --
Grandma looked so happy

06:05.933 --> 06:08.368
when she saw that
motorized-wheelchair commercial.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.337
Maybe we can get her one.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.839
We can surprise her
with it.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.407
Well, that's
a nice thought, boys,

06:13.441 --> 06:14.908
but I'm sure those machines
are very expensive.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.510
I called
the toll-free number,

06:16.544 --> 06:18.612
and they said
immobile seniors can qualify

06:18.646 --> 06:21.081
for a free Jazzy Power Chair
if they're 65 or older.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.517
And Grandma is...?
I don't know.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.419
You don't know?
 You don't know!

06:25.453 --> 06:26.454
But she made you.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.688
Do you know
 your mom's age?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.289
31.
28.
43.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.559
That's the combination
to the padlock on the shed.

06:34.462 --> 06:37.465
Um, Grandma,
how old are you?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.105
But you know
when your birthday is.

06:51.679 --> 06:52.646
I get that.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.248
March 24th
was my steak birthday.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.886
(funky music playing)

06:58.919 --> 07:00.320
(indistinct conversations)

07:02.155 --> 07:05.726
(music box playing
"Mary Had a Little Lamb")

07:05.759 --> 07:07.160
That's beautiful.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.662
Did you write that?

07:08.696 --> 07:10.397
Yes.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.832
(door closes)

07:11.865 --> 07:14.167
Oh, I am
 so glad you called.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.069
I need a drink.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.772
All day, I've been helping
Nicole with her science project.

07:18.806 --> 07:19.973
(sighs)

07:20.007 --> 07:21.441
How was the yard sale?
Good.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.911
I got a blender,
I got this music box,

07:23.944 --> 07:25.946
and I got some
porcelain mice figurines.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.949
(inhales sharply)

07:28.982 --> 07:31.251
Three ciders?
Who's the extra glass for?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.086
What the hell
are you doing here?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.922
What the hell
are you doing here?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.625
Jessica invited me.
Jessica invited me.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.926
You guys know each other?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.994
This is Sarah,
Nicole's mom.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.763
This is Sarah Sarah?

07:42.796 --> 07:45.533
And that's whore-face,
the woman who stole my husband.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.635
You know what?
I'm out of here.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.002
No. You can't go.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.538
I just put 50 cents
in the jukebox,

07:50.571 --> 07:52.172
and I picked
the two best songs

07:52.205 --> 07:53.974
from Sarah McLachlan's
"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy."

07:54.007 --> 07:56.710
And Deb doesn't let anyone leave
when McLachlan is playing.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.078
All right, everybody.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.782
I need you
to close your eyes

08:01.815 --> 08:03.851
and get ready
to feel this.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.886
(cheers and applause)

08:05.919 --> 08:08.021
Okay, Sarah, bring it.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.423
(Sarah McLachlan's
"Possession" plays)

08:14.895 --> 08:18.398
* Be the one to hold you down

08:18.431 --> 08:20.200
* Kiss you so hard

08:20.233 --> 08:26.039
And then the delivery man
backed his truck over my lawn.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.342
My point is,
 that was a real enemy.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.344
This, between you two,
is fixable.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.145
* Close your eyes

08:33.179 --> 08:34.748
You want to
take mine, too?

08:34.782 --> 08:36.482
I already put
my mouth on it.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.051
Seems to be your move.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.318
Mnh-mnh, no.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.221
My move would be
taking that cider,

08:41.254 --> 08:42.990
unhappy with
its previous glass,

08:43.023 --> 08:45.025
and upgrading it
to a fresh, new glass

08:45.058 --> 08:46.426
who is capable of love.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.697
Also, the old glass has
a prescription-drug problem.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.099
I have fibromyalgia!

08:52.132 --> 08:55.502
Two strong women
giving each other a hard time.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.170
This is good.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.006
This is healing.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.774
(sniffles)
(applause)

09:00.808 --> 09:03.243
(voice breaking)
Okay, everyone, uh...

09:03.276 --> 09:05.245
(music fading)
...just as a reminder,

09:05.278 --> 09:07.748
we're an official vendor
for Women's Fest tickets.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.049
See Pam at the bar.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.684
WOMAN: Whoo! Yeah, girl!

09:10.718 --> 09:13.386
I'm leaving.
Me too.

09:15.055 --> 09:19.059
Stop following me.
There's only one door.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.629
NARRATOR: Strange items have
 been found in the stomachs

09:21.662 --> 09:24.798
of tiger sharks,
 including old license plates,

09:24.832 --> 09:28.101
alarm clocks, tennis rackets.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.203
If Mom won't get me
a gold grille,

09:30.237 --> 09:32.539
maybe I can find one
inside a shark.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.108
Eddie, come on. Help us
figure out how old Grandma is.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.580
Grandma, when you were younger,
did you miss school because,

09:40.614 --> 09:42.816
"A," polio,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.284
"B," plague,

09:44.317 --> 09:46.319
or "C," volcanoes?

09:48.155 --> 09:49.589
Well, we were --

09:49.623 --> 09:52.059
Emery's doing a report about
grandmothers for school.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.761
(whispers) What?
Why would you say that?

09:53.794 --> 09:55.796
So we can surprise her
with the chair.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.931
(sighs)

09:57.965 --> 10:00.167
Where are you going?
To write the report.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.503
If my grandmother thinks
I'm writing a report on her,

10:03.536 --> 10:05.172
then I'm writing
a report on her.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.775
I don't know about y'all,
but I'm going to heaven.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.344
(doorbell rings)

10:13.480 --> 10:16.416
I am sorry
about yesterday.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.518
If I had known
that Sarah was Marvin's ex,

10:18.551 --> 10:21.054
I never would have put you
in that awkward position.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.825
Please accept
your Tupperware as an apology.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.593
(chuckles)
It's okay.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.861
It's not your fault.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.496
(timer dings)

10:29.529 --> 10:30.931
That's for
Nicole's science project.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.199
Come on in.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.167
We're studying the effects
of different corrosive acids

10:34.201 --> 10:35.035
on tooth enamel.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.237
Ooh.
Share your findings.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.875
Nice potion kit.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.844
Nicole, you were supposed to
take the teeth out

10:43.877 --> 10:45.012
when the timer went off.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.646
This was
a controlled experiment.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.448
So I'll do it now.
It's not a big deal.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.783
It is a big deal.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.118
This is
your school project,

10:51.151 --> 10:52.820
and you need to
get a good grade on it.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.988
You don't want to repeat
ninth grade like you did eighth.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.857
So, what if I do
get held back?

10:56.890 --> 10:58.225
Mom didn't even
graduate from high school,

10:58.258 --> 10:59.659
and she's doing great.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.628
She deejays at the Radisson
on Sundays,

11:01.661 --> 11:04.131
and she's the head of
the glove department at Saks.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.233
She said she can hook me up
with a job there whenever.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.567
Department head.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.337
She sells gloves out of a 4x4
counter next to the bathroom.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.539
She's a subdivision
of Hats and Scarves.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.641
(scoffs) And she's
way more fun than you.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.311
Uh, young lady, we're
in the middle of an experiment!

11:18.345 --> 11:21.882
Or have you forgotten about the
teeth-heat trial in the oven?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.383
Aw.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.186
Ruined.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.921
What was the goal?

11:27.955 --> 11:30.223
I hate always having to be
the hard-ass.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.492
(scoffs) You know,
Nicole has so much potential,

11:32.525 --> 11:34.061
but she won't
challenge herself

11:34.094 --> 11:35.662
because Sarah
keeps telling her

11:35.695 --> 11:37.530
she has some glove job
waiting for her,

11:37.564 --> 11:40.067
which, by the way,
Sarah doesn't even need

11:40.100 --> 11:42.535
because Marvin pays her
a ton of alimony.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.205
I wish that wasn't even
an option for Nicole.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.040
I wish she would
think bigger

11:47.074 --> 11:49.042
and realize
there's more out there.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.578
Thank you
for letting me vent.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.881
Absolutely.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.682
(door closes)
That's what I'm here for.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.518
Hey. Whoa.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.956
Where -- Where did you
get these?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.557
(telephone ringing)

12:15.903 --> 12:17.871
(line disconnects)

12:17.905 --> 12:20.373
Well, second cousin Susan
hung up on me again.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.409
I think we've exhausted
our options.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.077
You could pay
the long distance.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.578
Yeah, I think we're
out of options.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.249
I finished my report on Grandma.
I've got great news.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.918
I was looking through
old photographs,

12:30.951 --> 12:32.385
and I figured out
how old she is.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.088
Well, spit it out, man.
How old is she?

12:35.122 --> 12:36.790
Does she qualify
for a Jazzy Chair?

12:36.824 --> 12:38.425
She does. (chuckles)
(chuckles)

12:38.458 --> 12:41.061
(telephone rings)
Hello?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.163
AUTOMATED RECORDING: You have
 received a collect call from...

12:50.103 --> 12:53.273
(muzak plays)

12:53.306 --> 12:55.342
Excuse me. Do you --

12:55.375 --> 12:57.610
Oh, there's the bathroom.
Never mind.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.950
Hey, Jessica,
nice to see you.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.652
Who's buying these gloves?
Murderers?

13:05.685 --> 13:08.488
They're supposed to be putting
the head on a snowman.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.960
I see it now.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.361
So, what are you
doing here?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.129
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.530
Sure. What's up?

13:17.564 --> 13:20.100
Somebody ripped out a bunch
of seat protectors in there

13:20.133 --> 13:21.601
and threw them
on the floor.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.471
Okay, well,
that's not my department.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.340
(scoffs)
All right. Okay.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.442
You're welcome.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.044
Thank you...

13:31.078 --> 13:32.279
for...

13:32.312 --> 13:33.413
I took care
of your problem.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.615
I got Sarah fired.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.716
Uh...

13:42.689 --> 13:44.624
What do you mean
you got Sarah fired?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.060
You said you didn't want her
getting Nicole

13:47.094 --> 13:48.896
a job at Saks
to be an option,

13:48.929 --> 13:51.464
and now...it's not.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.699
What did you do?

13:52.732 --> 13:55.135
I went to Sarah's work,
and I talked to her.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.237
I explained to her
how she's putting you

13:57.270 --> 13:59.172
in a difficult position
with Nicole,

13:59.206 --> 14:01.041
always having to be
the hard-ass.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.575
She did not agree.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.577
She had a different version
of events.

14:04.611 --> 14:08.648
So I listened to her patiently,
said goodbye,

14:08.681 --> 14:10.750
then I went
and found her manager

14:10.783 --> 14:12.719
and told him
she was a racist.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.421
She said something
racist to you?

14:14.454 --> 14:17.657
No, of course not,
but I told him she did.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.093
I said, "She refused to
sell me gloves

14:20.127 --> 14:22.529
because her uncle
fought in the war."

14:22.562 --> 14:24.764
What war?
Whatever war. Doesn't matter.

14:24.797 --> 14:28.735
Jessica, when I said that thing
about Sarah and Nicole,

14:28.768 --> 14:30.003
I was just venting.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.905
Exactly. I know.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.406
Do you?

14:33.440 --> 14:34.241
Yes.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.708
Jessica?

14:35.742 --> 14:37.510
(sighs) Okay, fine.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.179
I have no idea
what you're talking about!

14:39.212 --> 14:40.447
You keep using this word
"venting."

14:40.480 --> 14:41.848
What does that even mean?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.716
If you didn't know,
why didn't you ask?

14:43.750 --> 14:45.852
Because sometimes
I need our conversations

14:45.885 --> 14:47.120
to move along, Honey.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.721
Do you know how long
they would take

14:48.755 --> 14:50.190
if I had to stop you
every time

14:50.223 --> 14:51.758
I didn't understand
a word you used?

14:51.791 --> 14:54.094
"Venting," "closure,"
"Clinique."

14:54.127 --> 14:56.063
"Venting" means
talking stuff out.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.131
I just needed you
to listen.
I did.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.466
I listened to your problem,

14:59.499 --> 15:02.635
and then I, as a friend,
help you to fix it.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.305
This is just gonna
make things harder for me.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.940
I mean, God knows
I don't like Sarah,

15:06.974 --> 15:09.042
but I definitely didn't
want her to lose her job.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.710
I thought you said
she didn't even need that job.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.812
Again,
I was just venting.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.714
I'm not even positive
that's true.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.649
So, venting is lying.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.918
And what about Nicole?

15:18.952 --> 15:20.387
She's gonna
hear about this

15:20.420 --> 15:22.222
and think that
I asked you to do it.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.492
So, you didn't want me
to do anything.
No.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.595
You just wanted to
talk it out.
Right.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.231
Because I was...
Venting.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.765
Yes. Okay.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.167
I get it now.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.835
Oh, Honey, don't worry.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.270
We're gonna fix this

15:37.304 --> 15:41.174
so you can put it all behind you
and get...Clinique.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.110
Close enough.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.980
NARRATOR: Next up, the great
 white shark attacks a seal,

15:47.014 --> 15:50.017
thrashing its prey around like
 a rag doll.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.619
Yo, the life of
an actual rag doll

15:52.652 --> 15:54.187
must be mad horrific.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.356
Hey, Mom,
me and the boys

15:56.389 --> 15:58.025
have some exciting news
to share.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.459
We figured out
how old you are.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.794
When I did
a report on you...

16:01.828 --> 16:05.098
that was assigned to me...
at school...by a teacher...

16:05.132 --> 16:07.667
I came across this old
photo.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.170
That baby is you.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.644
You're on page 11.
I dog-eared it.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.514
Anyway, I went to
the library

16:21.548 --> 16:24.317
and did some research
on the tractor manufacturer.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.453
That particular model
was only in production

16:26.486 --> 16:28.355
for one year
before it was discontinued.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.390
That year was 1927.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.859
So, Grandma,
you are 69 years old.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.727
Hmm.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.800
This means that
you can get

16:40.833 --> 16:42.869
a motorized wheelchair
for free!

16:42.902 --> 16:44.537
We'll put some
big old tires on it,

16:44.571 --> 16:46.173
hit Cocoa Beach
for spring break.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.516
Oh, Mom.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.819
(muzak plays)

16:59.852 --> 17:02.021
Back off, Gary.
The fern is mine.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.490
I brought it from home.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.691
Sarah, you're not fired.

17:04.723 --> 17:05.692
What?

17:05.724 --> 17:07.426
The customer
who filed the complaint

17:07.460 --> 17:09.229
against you
confessed she made it up.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.663
I'll tell you what --

17:10.696 --> 17:12.499
there are some
real wack-jobs out there.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.166
But we knew that
when we signed up

17:14.201 --> 17:16.069
for this crazy little game
called retail.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.338
I don't get why anybody
would do that.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.940
Mm, ask her.
She's right over there.

17:20.973 --> 17:24.111
**

17:24.144 --> 17:25.545
You already stole
my husband.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.247
Now you're trying to
get me fired?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.182
Actually, it was me.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.017
It was you?
Yes, it was me.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.253
I went to your manager,
I used your tears trick,

17:33.286 --> 17:35.555
and I got you fired.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.125
You were right about
"Milo and Otis." Very effective.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.959
She only did it
because she thought

17:39.992 --> 17:42.395
she was helping me,
but this isn't what I wanted.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.097
I don't want
bad things for you.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.133
Oh, you expect me
to believe that?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.535
You blame me for your marriage
with Marvin falling apart,

17:48.568 --> 17:49.536
and I get that.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.637
Don't flatter yourself.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.772
Marvin and I had issues
before you.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.041
You're the result
of the problems in my marriage,

17:55.074 --> 17:56.709
not the cause of them.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.146
Can I just ask
one question?

17:59.179 --> 18:01.481
What is the appeal
of Marvin?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.816
What am I missing here?

18:03.850 --> 18:06.653
It's not about Marvin.
Trust me.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.421
He's narcissistic,
insensitive,

18:08.455 --> 18:10.923
and he refuses to believe
he's losing his hearing.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.726
You know how loud
that man makes the TV?

18:13.760 --> 18:16.596
Oh, I guess we're all watching
"Mad About You."

18:16.629 --> 18:17.630
You know what?

18:17.664 --> 18:19.466
He's actually
 none of those things --

18:19.499 --> 18:22.101
Honey, I think
she's venting.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.904
Marvin's not the reason
I'm so mean to you.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.373
It's because of Nicole.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.942
I want her to like me
more than she likes you,

18:29.976 --> 18:32.779
which is why I let things
like her science project slide.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.347
As long as I'm always fun,

18:34.381 --> 18:36.849
Nicole will want to
spend time with me.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.686
Sarah, she'll want to
spend time with you
because you're her mom.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.355
And I will never get in the way
of that.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.292
I appreciate you
saying that.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.826
(gasps)

18:46.859 --> 18:48.461
Honey!

18:48.495 --> 18:50.497
It's what you've been
looking for --

18:50.530 --> 18:52.432
Clinique.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.867
**

18:58.004 --> 18:59.372
Oh, hi.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.673
Can I help you folks
with anything?

19:00.707 --> 19:02.942
One new wheelchair
for our grandma.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.277
And this pimp cane,
please.

19:04.311 --> 19:07.447
Uh, she qualifies
for a free Jazzy Power Chair.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.015
We don't have
a birth certificate for her,

19:09.048 --> 19:11.284
but my son has proof
that she's over 65.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.853
If you look at this baby picture
of her next to a tractor --

19:13.886 --> 19:15.222
Oh, no. No need.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.390
I can tell just by looking at
her she's obviously old enough.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.460
I'll just, uh,
get a Polaroid of her face

19:20.493 --> 19:22.061
to send
to the insurance company.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.197
I'm sure they'll approve
the application.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.365
Say, "Cheese."

19:33.206 --> 19:36.142
That's a lot of words for
"cheese" [chuckles] but okay.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.078
(camera shutter clicks)

19:39.111 --> 19:42.181
Oh. At least 65.
(chuckles)

19:42.215 --> 19:43.883
**

19:43.916 --> 19:46.553
So, even though
one of the blades is broken,

19:46.586 --> 19:48.988
my $3 blender
still blends.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.990
I love pulse.
Mm.

19:51.023 --> 19:55.828
I'll pulse anything --
strawberry, ice cube, egg.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.696
Hey, Marvin.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.399
Hi, sweetie.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.605
Hello, Jessica.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.177
Those teeth I borrowed were
from his private collection.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.779
He has spent years
gathering teeth

20:12.812 --> 20:14.514
from powerful
historical figures

20:14.547 --> 20:17.216
to put together
the perfect mouth.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.951
He calls it
"Mouth Brushmore."

20:18.985 --> 20:22.054
(chuckling)
I get why you like him now.

20:22.088 --> 20:22.889
(chuckles)

20:22.922 --> 20:25.224
Hi, Honey. Hi, Mrs. Huang.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.893
Maybe you and I
can hang out tonight,

20:26.926 --> 20:28.227
watch a movie
or something?

20:28.261 --> 20:29.862
You have to do
your math homework.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.231
Oh. I'm already done.
Mom helped me finish it.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.467
She said I had to
before she dropped me off.

20:34.501 --> 20:39.171
Oh. Uh, then, yeah, yeah,
a movie sounds nice.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.009
Oh,
this is a nice moment.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.778
After you're done with it,

20:45.812 --> 20:46.979
you might want to check
that math homework.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.015
Oh, yeah.
(whispers) Yeah.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.292
(engine shuts off)

21:01.961 --> 21:04.497
(dramatic music plays)

21:04.531 --> 21:08.635
NARRATOR:
 The lone hammerhead shark
 waits for the perfect moment

21:08.668 --> 21:10.937
to strike
 its unsuspecting prey.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.642
(scraping)

21:26.152 --> 21:29.155
