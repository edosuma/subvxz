00:01.667 --> 00:02.792
[instrumental music]

00:04.208 --> 00:06.583
If you ask me, these weekly
meetings are a pain in the butt.

00:06.667 --> 00:09.792
Yeah, I know, I know,
but it's the regs.

00:09.875 --> 00:11.667
Would you stop that?
You've been doing that all day.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.458
It's the jacket. It doesn't
fit right. It's never did.

00:13.542 --> 00:14.667
I've taken it to five tailors

00:14.750 --> 00:16.083
nobody gets it to fit just
right.

00:16.167 --> 00:17.917
It pulls here, rides up
back there, it's itchy.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.750
- I think I need a silk lining.
- 'Zack!'

00:20.833 --> 00:22.208
I have very sensitive skin.

00:22.292 --> 00:24.000
Feel this material.
It's like a winter coat.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.833
I don't want to feel it.
Leave me alone, okay.

00:25.917 --> 00:29.750
[sighing]
Women like a guy
who looks trim, neat.

00:29.833 --> 00:31.250
You gotta be sharp.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.917
I look like I'm wearing
a circus tent.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.583
Any minute now, a little
teeny car with 16 clowns in it

00:35.667 --> 00:37.125
is gonna come flying out
of my butt.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.875
[sighing]

00:38.958 --> 00:41.542
Garibaldi's fashion express,
go.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.958
(Susan)
'We've got a Code 7R.
You free?'

00:44.042 --> 00:45.208
Yeah, I'll be right there.

00:45.292 --> 00:47.083
Look, I gotta go.
You take notes for me, okay?

00:47.167 --> 00:49.333
No problem. Hey, chief,
wh-what's a Code 7R?

00:49.417 --> 00:50.583
I never heard
of that one before.

00:50.667 --> 00:52.292
Ah, it's-it's nothing important.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.500
You know how the bureaucracy is
always changing everything.

00:54.583 --> 00:57.167
Uh, catch you later.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.333
[door whirring]

01:00.292 --> 01:02.667
Sorry. I got here
as fast as I could.

01:02.750 --> 01:03.875
It's alright.

01:03.958 --> 01:05.792
Go on, Delenn,
you were saying.

01:05.875 --> 01:08.958
Wars are won or lost
before they're fought

01:09.042 --> 01:11.333
through preparation,
attitude, strategy

01:11.417 --> 01:13.250
and the selection
of proper allies.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.292
In the growing war
against the Shadows

01:15.375 --> 01:18.125
there may be some allies
we haven't approached yet.

01:19.417 --> 01:21.500
Many times over the last
million years

01:21.583 --> 01:23.833
the Shadows were fought
to a standstill

01:23.917 --> 01:25.292
by the First Ones

01:25.375 --> 01:28.333
races immeasurably
older than our own.

01:28.417 --> 01:32.208
'After the last war,
a thousand years ago'

01:32.292 --> 01:34.708
we believed the First Ones
went away forever

01:34.792 --> 01:36.875
passing beyond the Galactic Rim

01:36.958 --> 01:40.083
where no human or Minbari
has ever ventured.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.958
But the Vorlons remained.

01:42.042 --> 01:44.708
So it is possible that some of
the others may still be around.

01:44.792 --> 01:46.583
Well, if this is true
then why haven't we heard

01:46.667 --> 01:47.917
from them before now?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.833
They have grown tired
of constant warfare.

01:50.917 --> 01:54.083
Lost interest in the affairs
of the younger races.

01:54.167 --> 01:55.958
According to legend..

01:56.042 --> 01:58.958
...some went to sleep
in secret places

01:59.042 --> 02:01.125
deep beneath
their ancient cities

02:01.208 --> 02:03.292
where no one can bother them.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.667
The rest walk among the stars

02:05.750 --> 02:08.375
on errands we can never
hope to understand

02:08.458 --> 02:10.542
'barely aware of our existence.'

02:10.625 --> 02:12.667
Maybe it's time
we got their attention.

02:12.750 --> 02:14.042
(Marcus)
'Is it?'

02:14.125 --> 02:15.458
When I was being
trained on Minbar

02:15.542 --> 02:17.500
we were taught
that the First Ones

02:17.583 --> 02:20.542
are beyond anything
we've experienced before.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.542
They don't think like we do.

02:22.625 --> 02:25.375
They're old, powerful,
and dangerous

02:25.458 --> 02:28.042
and they don't like
to be bothered.

02:28.125 --> 02:29.792
A combination like that,
you may not want

02:29.875 --> 02:31.667
'to get their attention.'

02:31.750 --> 02:33.667
Some of the First Ones
could swat this station

02:33.750 --> 02:36.125
as if it were a fly, and not
even notice they'd done it.

02:36.208 --> 02:37.875
(Delenn)
'Marcus is correct.'

02:37.958 --> 02:39.958
Until now, we have warned
the rangers

02:40.042 --> 02:42.875
to avoid those places where
the First Ones still walk.

02:42.958 --> 02:45.708
They're dangerous
and unpredictable.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.958
But we're reaching a point
where we can no longer

02:48.042 --> 02:49.417
avoid taking risks.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.375
So how do we go about
sending them a message?

02:51.458 --> 02:54.167
(Delenn)
'If you only send a signal
they will not answer.'

02:54.250 --> 02:57.250
'They must be found
and contacted personally.'

02:57.333 --> 02:58.750
The danger is considerable

02:58.833 --> 03:01.792
and the odds of success
are very small.

03:01.875 --> 03:04.083
So I have invited
one other person

03:04.167 --> 03:05.917
to our meeting today.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
[instrumental music]

03:19.917 --> 03:21.833
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:23.250 --> 03:25.250
Captain.

03:25.333 --> 03:26.917
Delenn tells me
that you're going to try

03:27.000 --> 03:28.750
contacting the First Ones.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.667
It is a magnificent idea.

03:31.750 --> 03:34.833
A daring and splendid idea.

03:34.917 --> 03:37.333
In doing so,
you will see things

03:37.417 --> 03:40.292
'no human has ever seen before.'

03:40.375 --> 03:43.375
'It will be...fun.'

03:43.458 --> 03:45.542
Assuming you're not vaporized

03:45.625 --> 03:47.583
dissected, or otherwise killed

03:47.667 --> 03:51.917
in an assortment of supremely
horrible and painful ways.

03:53.542 --> 03:55.542
Exciting, isn't it?

03:55.625 --> 03:58.583
[dramatic music]

04:01.208 --> 04:02.500
(Susan)
The Babylon project

04:02.583 --> 04:05.625
was our last best hope
for peace.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.542
It failed.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.750
[instrumental music]

04:25.625 --> 04:27.333
But in the year
of the Shadow war

04:27.417 --> 04:29.875
it became something greater..

04:29.958 --> 04:31.917
...our last best hope..

04:32.000 --> 04:33.167
...for victory.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.417
[music continues]

04:38.333 --> 04:40.583
The year is 2260.

04:40.667 --> 04:41.958
The place..

04:42.042 --> 04:43.250
...Babylon 5.

04:45.542 --> 04:48.583
[theme music]

05:15.583 --> 05:18.625
[music continues]

05:30.167 --> 05:31.667
I have checked the data records
of the Great Machine

05:31.750 --> 05:33.583
running the planet below.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.542
It contains information which
might help in your search.

05:37.625 --> 05:40.792
'Reports of encounters
with alien forces'

05:40.875 --> 05:42.750
'beyond description.'

05:42.833 --> 05:45.375
Stories of vast
and nameless forces

05:45.458 --> 05:48.917
that prowl the ruins
of ancient cities.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.375
'Each report carried
with it...a warning'

05:53.667 --> 05:56.125
"Do not approach."

05:57.250 --> 05:58.500
To quote a human phrase

05:58.583 --> 05:59.750
it gives me

05:59.833 --> 06:02.250
the screaming willies.

06:02.333 --> 06:05.542
But I'm willing to do
all I can to help.

06:05.625 --> 06:09.292
I recommend that you
come down to the planet.

06:09.375 --> 06:11.542
We can go over it all
and select the most

06:11.625 --> 06:14.708
likely prospect for contact.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.625
Say, four standard hours?

06:18.458 --> 06:19.833
I'll be there.

06:22.292 --> 06:25.458
Mr. Allan. Julie Musante,
Ministry of Peace.

06:25.542 --> 06:27.292
Thank you for meeting me.
Is the captain with you?

06:27.375 --> 06:30.875
Uh, no. Sorry. I tried to reach
him, but he's in a meeting.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.375
Oh. Well, no matter. We'll catch
up to him at his office.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.750
Could you help my bags taken
to some appropriate quarters?

06:36.833 --> 06:37.958
I'll be here a while.

06:38.042 --> 06:39.500
Yeah, sure.
It's right this way.

06:39.583 --> 06:43.458
I studied the station map
before I arrived, Mr. Allan.

06:43.542 --> 06:44.875
I know the way.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.417
[instrumental music]

06:55.083 --> 06:56.500
Good day, ambassador.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.792
And to you, G'Kar.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.833
- You are well, I trust?
- Yes, thank you.

07:02.917 --> 07:06.583
Ah, no problems back home?
Nothing troubling you?

07:06.667 --> 07:07.833
Not that I'm aware of.

07:07.917 --> 07:10.167
- Thank you. Good day.
- Thanks.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.583
Well, I'm happy to hear it.
I was getting concerned.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.125
You see I've noticed
that you've been spending

07:15.208 --> 07:17.208
quite a bit of time
in closed meetings

07:17.292 --> 07:19.167
with Captain Sheridan.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.000
[laughing]
One might always
get the impression that

07:21.083 --> 07:23.667
uh, something was, uh, up.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.708
Just the usual
diplomatic exchanges

07:25.792 --> 07:26.833
between our two governments.

07:26.917 --> 07:30.375
Ah, yes. Of course.
Of course.

07:30.458 --> 07:32.000
Well, as I'm no longer
on the council

07:32.083 --> 07:34.042
I suppose I've forgotten
how to tell the difference

07:34.125 --> 07:38.333
between a political session
and a private meeting.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.667
I heard an interesting word
the other day

07:41.750 --> 07:44.042
a word I hadn't
encountered before.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.875
Good, I'm pleased to hear
that you're continuing

07:46.958 --> 07:49.083
to expand your frame
of reference, G'Kar.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.542
What do you know about Rangers?

07:56.208 --> 07:58.000
Nothing. Why? Should I?

07:58.083 --> 08:01.125
Well, it's a curious thing,
Delenn.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.750
My contacts have mentioned
the word

08:02.833 --> 08:04.083
to me from time to time

08:04.167 --> 08:06.208
and sometimes
they're speaking of a human

08:06.292 --> 08:09.375
and sometimes
they're speaking of a Minbari.

08:09.458 --> 08:10.833
If one didn't know better

08:10.917 --> 08:13.500
one might conclude
that these humans and Minbari

08:13.583 --> 08:16.833
are both part
of the same organization.

08:16.917 --> 08:21.292
'But that seems extremely
unlikely does it not, Delenn?'

08:21.375 --> 08:23.708
Yes. Extremely.

08:27.042 --> 08:29.042
Well, thank you
for your time, Delenn.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.833
Since you aren't
able to help me

08:31.917 --> 08:36.000
I'll just continue making
inquiries on my own!

08:36.083 --> 08:38.875
Eventually I will
figure it out.

08:38.958 --> 08:41.000
[dramatic music]

08:42.250 --> 08:44.375
I'll let you know what I find.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.667
(John)
'Ms. Musante'

08:52.875 --> 08:54.000
I'm sorry I got tied up.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.458
If I'd known you were coming..

08:55.542 --> 08:58.292
You have some very impressive
objects here, captain.

08:58.375 --> 09:01.917
Earthforce Silver Star
for valor in the Minbari war.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.292
'Commendations, you have
orders of promotion.'

09:05.375 --> 09:08.417
But e-except for the seal
of the Earth Alliance

09:08.500 --> 09:10.292
I don't really see much
that gives a sense

09:10.375 --> 09:12.500
of walking into the heart
of the Earth government

09:12.583 --> 09:14.000
here on Babylon 5.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.625
Well, I, uh..

09:18.708 --> 09:20.667
...prefer a more
informal office.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.958
And as it is..

09:24.042 --> 09:25.542
...my office, ah..

09:25.625 --> 09:26.958
Oh, yes, of course it is.

09:27.042 --> 09:29.833
Well, I was simply trying
to be of assistance.

09:29.917 --> 09:33.167
I've been assigned here
by the Ministry of Peace..

09:33.250 --> 09:34.875
...the Nightwatch Division.

09:34.958 --> 09:36.125
Under the direct authority

09:36.208 --> 09:38.833
of the Babylon 5 senate
oversight committee.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.500
I'm to be your new
political officer.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.333
I don't need
a political officer.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.833
(Julie)
'Oh, but the senate disagrees.'

09:45.917 --> 09:48.833
Things are very touchy
back home, captain.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.750
Some of your recent actions
have not been

09:50.833 --> 09:52.375
as politically astute
as they might have been.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.833
Now just a minute. I--

09:53.917 --> 09:56.208
I'm only repeating
what I've been told.

09:56.292 --> 09:57.875
No need to kill the messenger.

10:00.542 --> 10:03.667
Your decisions might
have been correct..

10:03.750 --> 10:04.958
...on some level.

10:05.042 --> 10:06.875
'But there are ways
of doing things'

10:06.958 --> 10:08.667
'so that they reflect
more favorably'

10:08.750 --> 10:10.417
'on the Earth government.'

10:10.500 --> 10:13.458
And so it was decided that you
needed a political officer.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.083
Someone who can whisper
in your ear

10:16.167 --> 10:18.000
who could warn you
about governmental policies

10:18.083 --> 10:19.833
you might bump into.

10:19.917 --> 10:22.083
Someone who could...keep you
from making

10:22.167 --> 10:25.708
costly political mistakes that
might jeopardize your career

10:25.792 --> 10:26.917
back home.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.083
- Zack.
- Yes, sir.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.625
- Take a walk.
- Yes, sir.

10:33.292 --> 10:35.042
Get this straight,
Ms. Musante.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.083
This is my command.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.667
My position as military governor

10:39.750 --> 10:42.625
is guaranteed under the charter
of the Babylon project.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.042
Yes, I've read it.

10:44.125 --> 10:47.125
It does not exclude the presence
of a political officer.

10:47.208 --> 10:49.917
But perhaps you could show me
the paragraph that I missed.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.750
This is a military outpost.

10:51.833 --> 10:55.125
Which answers
to a civilian government.

10:55.208 --> 10:57.625
Decisions made by
military officers

10:57.708 --> 11:00.875
must reflect the current
governmental policies.

11:00.958 --> 11:02.875
The President proposes..

11:02.958 --> 11:04.500
...and the military disposes.

11:06.417 --> 11:09.250
Unless there's been a coup
and no one told me.

11:09.333 --> 11:12.917
The President invested me
with sole authority here.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.417
Unless I receive orders
to the contrary

11:15.500 --> 11:17.625
I refuse to share
that authority

11:17.708 --> 11:19.750
with an unqualified civilian.

11:19.833 --> 11:21.917
[instrumental music]

11:23.083 --> 11:25.750
And no one is asking you to.

11:25.833 --> 11:28.917
I am simply here to advise.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.500
Captain, the decision's
already been made.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.000
There's nothing
we can do about it.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.708
So I suggest
that we do what we can

11:35.792 --> 11:37.333
to live with it amicably.

11:37.417 --> 11:38.958
For starters,
I need you to fill me in

11:39.042 --> 11:40.917
on what's been happening here.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.417
And I suggest dinner

11:42.500 --> 11:44.917
at the Fresh Air restaurant
in a couple of hours.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.375
Around 1800 hours.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.042
[music continues]

11:50.125 --> 11:53.125
Uh, I can't.
I have another appointment.

11:53.208 --> 11:56.375
Really? There's nothing posted
on your schedule.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.958
What is it?

11:58.042 --> 11:59.167
Perhaps I could help.

12:01.833 --> 12:03.792
Uh, it's..

12:03.875 --> 12:05.458
...nothing I can't cancel.

12:05.542 --> 12:07.083
Good.

12:07.167 --> 12:09.333
In time, you'll find I'm..

12:09.417 --> 12:11.125
...not as bad
as you might think.

12:12.375 --> 12:13.958
I'll see you at 1800 hours.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.500
[instrumental music]

12:18.583 --> 12:20.250
[device beeping]

12:20.333 --> 12:23.083
Commander, I've got the captain
on channel one for you.

12:23.167 --> 12:24.292
I'll take it in his office.

12:28.542 --> 12:30.000
Captain, what's up?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.667
(John)
'I just had the entire
Earth bureaucracy'

12:32.750 --> 12:34.250
'landed right on my back.'

12:34.333 --> 12:36.917
Look, I can't make
my appointment on Epsilon 3.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.542
You'll have to go in my place.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.167
Get the information
and get back as soon as you can.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.042
Not a problem.
Anything else you need?

12:43.125 --> 12:46.250
A glass of whiskey, a gun,
and two bullets.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.417
Understood.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.958
I'll call you when I get back.

12:49.042 --> 12:50.375
Your quarters
are right this way.

12:50.458 --> 12:51.333
Thank you.

12:51.417 --> 12:52.833
So how'd it go with the captain?

12:52.917 --> 12:54.458
Fine. He's a loyal soldier.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.458
He knows
where his priorities are.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.833
He'll come around.

12:57.917 --> 13:00.708
In the meantime,
I'll need you to fill me in.

13:00.792 --> 13:01.958
On what?

13:02.042 --> 13:05.167
On whatever the captain chooses
not to tell me.

13:05.250 --> 13:08.000
Just until he does come around,
of course.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.708
Zack, you are a member
of Nightwatch.

13:10.792 --> 13:13.083
You have priorities as well.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.333
Never make the mistake
of forgetting that.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.708
[dramatic music]

13:17.792 --> 13:18.875
Are you coming?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.208
[exhaling]

13:24.750 --> 13:27.333
[door whirring]

13:27.417 --> 13:30.458
[instrumental music]

13:40.000 --> 13:42.250
[instrumental music]

13:49.292 --> 13:52.625
I asked for Captain Sheridan!

13:52.708 --> 13:54.583
Ah. He's busy.

13:56.417 --> 13:59.417
I don't like surprises.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.250
Really? Love 'em myself.

14:01.333 --> 14:02.917
I mean, to me,
everything's a surprise.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.250
You're a surprise.
This place is a surprise.

14:06.333 --> 14:09.208
You see this?
Paper cut. Hurts like hell.

14:09.292 --> 14:10.917
Anybody else would be upset,
but to me it's just

14:11.000 --> 14:12.417
one more wonderful surprise.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.417
'I mean, I even surprise
myself sometimes.'

14:14.500 --> 14:16.000
So I guess
there's nothing wrong with me

14:16.083 --> 14:18.000
surprising you...right?

14:19.542 --> 14:21.958
[laughing]

14:22.042 --> 14:23.708
I like you!

14:25.083 --> 14:26.250
You're trouble.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.125
[chuckling]
Well, thank you.

14:28.208 --> 14:30.417
That the nicest thing anybody's
said about me in days.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.917
This way.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.042
[instrumental music]

14:38.875 --> 14:42.625
So right now, we're in the lull
between storms.

14:42.708 --> 14:43.750
Now unless they're stopped

14:43.833 --> 14:45.458
the Centauri
will just keep moving in

14:45.542 --> 14:47.125
on the league
of non-aligned worlds.

14:47.208 --> 14:50.667
Well, I'm sure that's the rumor,
but you know how rumors are.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.292
Earth would never ally itself

14:52.375 --> 14:53.875
with a government
that's bent on war.

14:53.958 --> 14:56.500
Yes, but we've signed
a treaty with the Centauri.

14:56.583 --> 14:59.625
Exactly. Which proves my point.

14:59.708 --> 15:01.333
Mm, these noodles
are wonderful.

15:01.417 --> 15:04.042
- Do you want some?
- No, no. Thank you. I'm fine.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.625
Mm...this is just
the sort of thing

15:06.708 --> 15:08.083
I was trying to explain earlier.

15:08.167 --> 15:10.875
Alright, so you
have some concerns.

15:10.958 --> 15:13.125
But there are ways
of expressing these concerns

15:13.208 --> 15:14.958
which won't cause problems

15:15.042 --> 15:17.292
for our leaders back home.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.583
- Is that soy sauce?
- Yeah.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.000
Alright, well,
enough about politics.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.958
So, how are things here
on the station?

15:23.042 --> 15:25.750
Fine, fine.
Uh, status quo.

15:25.833 --> 15:28.500
Uh, we've had problems with
the lurkers, but nothing--

15:28.583 --> 15:29.875
- Lurkers?
- Yeah.

15:29.958 --> 15:32.667
It's our version
of the homeless.

15:32.750 --> 15:35.000
In many ways we have
the same problem Earth does.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.917
Mm, Earth doesn't have homeless.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.125
Excuse me?

15:38.208 --> 15:40.542
We don't have the problem.

15:40.625 --> 15:45.167
Yes, there are some displaced
people here and there.

15:45.250 --> 15:48.000
But, uh, they've chosen
to be in that position.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.000
They're either lazy,
or they're criminal

15:50.083 --> 15:51.750
or they're mentally unstable.

15:51.833 --> 15:53.292
They can't get a job.

15:53.375 --> 15:56.833
Earthgov has promised a job
to anyone that wants one.

15:56.917 --> 15:59.792
So, if someone doesn't
have a job..

15:59.875 --> 16:01.292
...they must not want one.

16:01.375 --> 16:03.333
Oh.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.375
- Uh, poverty?
- Hm, it's the same.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.458
- Crime?
- Yes, there is some.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.667
But it's all caused
by the mentally unstable.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.042
And we've just instituted
correctional centers

16:12.125 --> 16:14.167
to filter them out
at an early age.

16:14.250 --> 16:15.417
Hm.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.625
- Prejudice?
- Hmm?

16:17.708 --> 16:19.250
No, we're just..

16:19.333 --> 16:20.458
...one happy planet.

16:22.125 --> 16:24.250
Well, alright,
there's the Marsies, but..

16:24.333 --> 16:25.708
...that won't change
until they stop

16:25.792 --> 16:27.375
fighting the Earth rule.

16:27.458 --> 16:30.708
And when-when exactly
did all this happen?

16:30.792 --> 16:32.375
When we rewrote the dictionary.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.125
Captain..

16:37.292 --> 16:38.375
...you're a good man.

16:38.458 --> 16:41.583
You're a fine soldier.
A leader.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.417
You understand that sometimes

16:43.500 --> 16:45.083
before you can deal
with a problem

16:45.167 --> 16:47.958
you have to...redefine it.

16:48.042 --> 16:49.708
But you can't deal
with the problems

16:49.792 --> 16:51.542
by pretending they don't exist.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.250
[sighing]

16:53.333 --> 16:55.292
There's no need
to embarrass our leaders

16:55.375 --> 16:57.083
by pointing out the flaws
in our society

16:57.167 --> 17:01.083
that they're aware of, and
dealing with in their own way.

17:01.167 --> 17:04.917
Some people just enjoy
finding fault with our leaders.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.167
They're anarchists.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.833
'They're troublemakers'

17:07.917 --> 17:10.167
'or they're simply
just unpatriotic.'

17:10.250 --> 17:13.000
'None of which describes you.'

17:13.083 --> 17:15.083
'Now, do you want people
thinking otherwise?'

17:17.000 --> 17:19.792
These are the areas
that I want to help you with.

17:19.875 --> 17:22.375
Uh, I want to feel
like I'm needed

17:22.458 --> 17:24.833
that I'm doing my part
to help bring the Earthgov

17:24.917 --> 17:27.000
back into the hands
of the decent, hard working

17:27.083 --> 17:28.958
people that created it.

17:29.042 --> 17:31.167
I am here to protect you.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.917
I admire your honesty

17:35.000 --> 17:37.083
and your record
and your attitude.

17:37.167 --> 17:40.250
And I don't want to see anyone
use those things against you.

17:42.125 --> 17:46.292
Quite frankly, I think
I could come to like you..

17:46.375 --> 17:47.500
...quite a lot.

17:48.542 --> 17:49.583
Mm.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.833
Well, here we are.

17:53.917 --> 17:56.583
If you'll just plug yourself
into the matrix

17:56.667 --> 17:58.750
we'll take it from there.

17:58.833 --> 18:02.250
Um...it's, um, occupied.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.833
Hmm? Oh. Yes, of course.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.542
Uh, my mistake.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.958
I spend so much time
out of my body

18:09.042 --> 18:11.292
I sometimes forget where it is.

18:12.708 --> 18:14.375
If you'll excuse me.

18:15.875 --> 18:19.000
It will only take a moment
for me to...

18:19.083 --> 18:20.458
...disentangle myself.

18:20.542 --> 18:22.583
I.. Hmm.

18:22.667 --> 18:26.208
I must remember to dust myself
once in a while.

18:26.292 --> 18:28.167
This is hardly appropriate.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.250
Well, here you go.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.333
Oh, your jacket.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.167
It really is quite safe.

18:34.250 --> 18:37.500
I have set the machine
so it can handle humans.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.250
And I've made sure
that it can deal with my absence

18:40.333 --> 18:42.667
for several hours if necessary.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.083
So, what do I do?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.208
Ah, just relax.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.875
The program will take you
from there.

18:51.708 --> 18:54.000
Open your mind.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.250
But whatever you do..

18:56.333 --> 18:59.667
...do not stray from the path.

[instrumental music]

21:43.125 --> 21:44.208
Wait.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.250
There's something else.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.208
That's Earthforce One
before it exploded.

21:54.458 --> 21:56.542
'I-I can warn them.'

21:56.625 --> 22:01.083
- 'I can save the President.'
- 'No. It's too late.'

22:01.167 --> 22:05.083
(Draal)
'You're seeing the shadow
of things long gone.'

22:05.167 --> 22:07.875
[static]

22:07.958 --> 22:12.125
I have wanted Santiago dead
for so long.

22:12.208 --> 22:14.417
I wasn't sure we could really
pull it off.

22:16.125 --> 22:17.750
You're sure it's done?

22:17.833 --> 22:21.250
(male #1)
'Earthforce One
will never return from Io.'

22:21.333 --> 22:24.167
'The power's now yours, Clark.'

22:24.250 --> 22:26.167
'Mr. President.'

22:26.250 --> 22:28.292
[dramatic music]

22:35.000 --> 22:38.042
[explosion]

22:44.917 --> 22:46.750
(Draal)
'I do not understand.'

22:46.833 --> 22:50.875
A normal human mind should not
have been able to do that.

22:50.958 --> 22:54.458
I-I saw it.
I-I saw it all.

22:54.542 --> 22:56.375
Uh, the image I saw..

22:56.458 --> 22:57.708
...the message,
can you record it?

22:57.792 --> 23:00.792
- Yes. But how--
- Do it, please!

23:00.875 --> 23:02.792
It's the proof we've needed
that President Santiago

23:02.875 --> 23:05.042
was assassinated, that Clark
was behind everything.

23:07.125 --> 23:08.208
We've got it.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.958
Now we've got it.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.125
[instrumental music]

23:16.375 --> 23:17.792
[door whirring]

23:17.875 --> 23:19.458
I appreciate the help,
captain.

23:19.542 --> 23:22.292
I can't imagine what happened
to scramble my lock code.

23:22.375 --> 23:25.042
Well, security should have it
open in a little while.

23:25.125 --> 23:28.292
- Can I fix you a drink? Yeah.
- Oh, God, yes, please.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.167
Oh, I like your quarters.

23:30.250 --> 23:33.083
It's a bit larger
than standard, isn't it?

23:33.167 --> 23:35.042
Yeah, a little.

23:35.125 --> 23:37.042
They tried to hit me up
for rent on this place

23:37.125 --> 23:38.542
last year, can you believe it?

23:38.625 --> 23:40.833
(Julie)
'Well, we must all
do our part.'

23:40.917 --> 23:42.208
I don't mind doing my part.

23:42.292 --> 23:45.333
I just object
to doing their part as well.

23:45.417 --> 23:46.458
It's, uh..

23:47.417 --> 23:49.417
[instrumental music]

23:49.500 --> 23:51.292
As I said..

23:51.375 --> 23:52.917
...we must all do our part.

23:54.750 --> 23:56.083
Perhaps now you find
the presence

23:56.167 --> 23:58.750
of a political officer
a bit more appealing.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.542
[clearing throat]
I, uh, don't think--

24:02.625 --> 24:05.042
Good. Don't.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.042
[dramatic music]

24:10.500 --> 24:11.458
[Julie gasping]

24:11.542 --> 24:14.583
[both moaning]

24:17.917 --> 24:19.750
[music continues]

24:21.708 --> 24:22.750
[moaning]

24:25.000 --> 24:25.875
Better.

24:25.958 --> 24:27.625
Um, but there's no need to rush.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.208
No.

24:29.292 --> 24:30.500
No, there's not.

24:30.583 --> 24:31.667
[chuckling softly]

24:33.125 --> 24:34.167
So, uh..

24:34.250 --> 24:36.875
...if you could just wait, uh..

24:36.958 --> 24:39.292
...two seconds,
I-I'll be right back.

24:43.708 --> 24:46.792
[instrumental music]

24:49.625 --> 24:50.792
Oh.

24:50.875 --> 24:52.375
My usual timing. Sorry.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.750
It's not what it seems.
Now, what are you doing?

24:54.833 --> 24:56.542
I'm using Draal's
holographic system.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.792
Captain, I've got a lead
on some of the First Ones.

24:58.875 --> 25:00.167
There's a chance
we can catch 'em, but it means

25:00.250 --> 25:01.667
leaving right now,
we don't have much time.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.750
Damn it. I can't leave
without an explanation.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.083
She'll be all over me.

25:06.167 --> 25:08.375
Looks to me like she's already
all over you.

25:08.458 --> 25:11.292
Hell, I can't risk exposing
the operation to an outsider.

25:11.375 --> 25:12.875
You'll have to go without me.

25:12.958 --> 25:14.333
'Get a hold of Garibaldi.'

25:14.417 --> 25:16.250
You'll need someone on board
who speaks Minbari.

25:16.333 --> 25:19.083
- And...be careful.
- Yeah, same to you.

25:19.167 --> 25:21.500
Oh, and, captain, while I
was in his computer system

25:21.583 --> 25:23.750
I found something else you're
gonna find very interesting.

25:23.833 --> 25:25.250
- What?
- It's a long story.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.708
I'll uplink the data
to Garibaldi before I leave.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.583
(Julie)
'John?'

25:29.667 --> 25:32.417
Good luck, captain. I think
you're about to go where

25:32.500 --> 25:33.625
everyone has gone before.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.250
You..

25:36.333 --> 25:39.417
[instrumental music]

25:40.000 --> 25:41.708
[laughing]

25:43.333 --> 25:46.250
Well, it must be...colder
in here than I thought.

25:47.917 --> 25:49.000
I'll fix it.

25:54.125 --> 25:57.208
[instrumental music]

26:00.542 --> 26:01.958
Ah, Mr. Garibaldi.

26:02.042 --> 26:04.083
Could you tell me where to find
Commander Ivanova?

26:04.167 --> 26:06.458
We had a meeting scheduled
but she never showed up.

26:06.542 --> 26:08.125
Ah, she got called
off-station on business.

26:08.208 --> 26:09.917
Very last minute.
I gotta go.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.708
There have been
many last minute things

26:11.792 --> 26:13.958
happening around here,
Mr. Garibaldi.

26:14.042 --> 26:15.292
I once believed the Centauri

26:15.375 --> 26:18.292
had the market on secret
meetings on Babylon 5.

26:18.375 --> 26:21.208
[chuckling]
It appears
they have some competition.

26:21.292 --> 26:22.625
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.417
Everything's status quo.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.250
Mr. Garibaldi, stop!

26:27.333 --> 26:29.792
The Centauri took my world,
my government, my..

26:29.875 --> 26:31.333
...my title.

26:31.417 --> 26:34.042
They did not take
my self respect.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.000
And I thought they had
not taken the respect

26:36.083 --> 26:38.208
I had earned from others.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.417
Was I wrong in thinking that?

26:41.917 --> 26:45.500
Something is going on,
Mr. Garibaldi.

26:45.583 --> 26:47.667
I sense a gathering of forces

26:47.750 --> 26:50.375
that could perhaps
help my people.

26:50.458 --> 26:54.917
I know we have never
exactly been friends.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.167
But until now,
we have never been strangers.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.042
G'Kar, look, um,
if there were anything I thought

27:01.125 --> 27:03.167
could help you or your people

27:03.250 --> 27:04.208
I'd tell you.

27:04.292 --> 27:06.292
Then perhaps I could help you.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.042
I appreciate that,
but I don't see how.

27:09.125 --> 27:11.542
Well, then...maybe
that's something

27:11.625 --> 27:13.250
you should work on.

27:13.333 --> 27:16.417
[instrumental music]

27:24.958 --> 27:26.208
Good morning.

27:26.292 --> 27:28.125
Oh, good morning, Mr. Allan.

27:28.208 --> 27:30.917
So how'd your meeting go
with the captain last night?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.708
Fine, fine.

27:32.792 --> 27:34.542
And when it comes
to your union situation here

27:34.625 --> 27:36.375
he must be a very
good negotiator.

27:36.458 --> 27:37.625
I've never seen anyone come up

27:37.708 --> 27:39.333
with so many creative ways
of saying

27:39.417 --> 27:41.333
no to a simple proposition.

27:42.792 --> 27:45.958
Well, I've always liked
the sound of yes myself.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.958
Did you know that your jacket
doesn't fit, Mr. Allan?

27:52.042 --> 27:54.000
I suggest you have it adjusted.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.333
Mr. Allan.

27:59.417 --> 28:00.750
I've called a meeting
in three hours

28:00.833 --> 28:03.417
to go over the new
political protocol.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.708
I expect to see you there.

28:06.458 --> 28:07.500
Yes, ma'am.

28:11.958 --> 28:15.000
[dramatic music]

28:30.917 --> 28:32.000
Lennier?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.667
(Marcus)
'He couldn't make it.'

28:36.750 --> 28:39.042
I need someone
who speaks Minbari.

28:39.125 --> 28:40.208
You found him.

28:41.708 --> 28:43.125
I did spend
almost a year living there

28:43.208 --> 28:44.833
but if you'd rather
I'd left, that's fine.

28:44.917 --> 28:47.125
I'm sure they must have
an Earth-Minbari dictionary

28:47.208 --> 28:48.708
lying around somewhere.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.625
Tell them to set course
for Sigma 957.

28:58.708 --> 29:01.708
Ne Tawa, ness-ah
Sigma tet-vo-chen.

29:01.792 --> 29:04.875
[instrumental music]

29:09.917 --> 29:12.208
Before coming here,
I was authorized to begin

29:12.292 --> 29:14.042
'implementing certain changes.'

29:14.125 --> 29:15.542
'From this point on'

29:15.625 --> 29:17.917
it will be inappropriate
for Earthforce personnel

29:18.000 --> 29:21.250
to publicly criticize the
government or its decisions.

29:21.333 --> 29:22.833
'Violations of this
will result in'

29:22.917 --> 29:24.750
'immediate fines and penalties.'

29:24.833 --> 29:26.375
What about civilians?

29:26.458 --> 29:28.667
Well, that's not something
you need to worry about.

29:28.750 --> 29:31.292
Just take down the information
and pass it along.

29:31.375 --> 29:33.292
We'll take it from there.

29:33.375 --> 29:36.042
'The new policies also expand
the range of investigation'

29:36.125 --> 29:37.792
'to include past associations'

29:37.875 --> 29:40.250
'families and friends
who might draw others'

29:40.333 --> 29:42.333
'into compromising situations.'

29:42.417 --> 29:43.542
[clearing throat]

29:43.625 --> 29:46.250
Is there a problem,
Sergeant Allan?

29:46.333 --> 29:47.667
Well, yeah.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.833
Babylon 5 security
is supposed to act

29:49.917 --> 29:52.125
according to the rules
of due process.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.833
When enforcing criminal law
that's correct.

29:54.917 --> 29:57.708
But you are now an arm
of the political office..

29:57.792 --> 30:00.833
'...and this widens the scope
of your authority.'

30:00.917 --> 30:03.458
You are empowered to examine
station publications

30:03.542 --> 30:06.250
to ensure that they're
ideologically correct.

30:06.333 --> 30:07.708
We've revised
the rules of evidence

30:07.792 --> 30:09.208
to make them more flexible.

30:09.292 --> 30:11.375
Isn't all this
a little extreme?

30:11.458 --> 30:13.875
(Julie)
'Yes. Yes, it is.'

30:13.958 --> 30:16.125
'I shouldn't be
telling you this yet..'

30:16.208 --> 30:18.125
'...but in the coming months
certain individuals'

30:18.208 --> 30:20.167
'will be purged from their
government positions'

30:20.250 --> 30:23.542
'on charges of sedition,
immoral conduct..'

30:23.625 --> 30:26.625
'...even spying
for alien governments.'

30:26.708 --> 30:28.708
'With our basic freedoms
at stake'

30:28.792 --> 30:31.208
'no response
can be too extreme.'

30:31.292 --> 30:34.375
There may be some minor
and temporary abridgments

30:34.458 --> 30:36.208
in the traditionally
protected areas

30:36.292 --> 30:37.458
of speech and association

30:37.542 --> 30:40.375
but only until this crisis
is over.

30:40.458 --> 30:44.000
We have been betrayed
on nearly every level.

30:44.083 --> 30:47.417
And it is going to take the
efforts of every loyal citizen

30:47.500 --> 30:49.042
to keep Earth safe..

30:50.042 --> 30:52.125
...and ideologically pure.

30:53.042 --> 30:55.125
[instrumental music]

30:58.875 --> 31:00.167
(Susan)
'Anything yet?'

31:00.250 --> 31:02.083
Nothing. Same as I told you
an hour ago.

31:02.167 --> 31:05.167
[sighing]
Maybe we can adjust
the scanners.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.208
They've been adjusted
five times.

31:07.292 --> 31:08.833
All we can do now is wait.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.958
How long has it been since
you've had nothing to do?

31:14.042 --> 31:15.250
I have responsibilities.

31:15.333 --> 31:17.792
And what of responsibilities
to yourself?

31:17.875 --> 31:20.708
You don't have to keep busy
every moment of every day.

31:20.792 --> 31:22.458
I don't remember authorizing
a change

31:22.542 --> 31:24.375
in discussion
to include my personal life.

31:24.458 --> 31:27.708
I have to be authorized
to talk to you like a person?

31:27.792 --> 31:29.292
Just what is it
you're running from?

31:29.375 --> 31:30.917
Don't you have anything to do?

31:32.333 --> 31:33.958
Nope. I'm all yours.

31:34.042 --> 31:35.125
[device beeping]

31:35.208 --> 31:37.250
What's that?

31:37.333 --> 31:38.750
I think we just found them.

31:38.833 --> 31:40.500
[instrumental music]

31:40.583 --> 31:43.667
[electricity crackling]

31:48.542 --> 31:50.458
[instrumental music]

31:52.375 --> 31:53.708
Transmitting recognition signal.

31:53.792 --> 31:55.500
Let's see
if Draal's information is right.

31:55.583 --> 31:58.667
[engine whirring]

32:06.208 --> 32:07.667
[engine stalling]

32:07.750 --> 32:10.042
- What's happening?
- Energy drain.

32:10.125 --> 32:11.708
It started as it
came towards us.

32:11.792 --> 32:13.750
- Move us away!
- Fezon, chok!

32:13.833 --> 32:15.083
[device beeping]

32:15.167 --> 32:17.208
[dramatic music]

32:30.208 --> 32:32.417
My name is Susan Ivanova.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.000
Commander, Earthforce.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.542
This ship is the White Star.

32:36.625 --> 32:39.667
We've come to find you.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.708
'The enemy that you fought
before has returned.'

32:42.792 --> 32:44.042
In order to fight the Shadows

32:44.125 --> 32:46.375
we've formed an alliance
with others.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.208
The Great Machine on Epsilon 3

32:48.292 --> 32:49.958
the Minbari, the Vorlons--

32:50.042 --> 32:52.625
Vorlon tavutna chog!

32:52.708 --> 32:53.875
I think you just hit a nerve.

32:53.958 --> 32:56.333
The Vorlons must owe
them money or something.

32:56.417 --> 32:58.208
At least it tell us that
they understand our language.

32:58.292 --> 33:00.333
They're just not willing
to speak to us in it.

33:00.417 --> 33:02.500
Who knew they were French?

33:02.583 --> 33:04.458
I'm sorry.

33:04.542 --> 33:07.208
We've come to ask you
for your help.

33:07.292 --> 33:09.542
Will you join us in a fight
against the Shadows?

33:10.542 --> 33:12.042
[screeching]

33:13.917 --> 33:15.042
Is that a yes or a no?

33:16.375 --> 33:17.375
They're not moving away.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.208
I'd say they were
thinking it over.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.208
[sighing]

33:24.125 --> 33:26.917
I have wanted Santiago
dead for so long.

33:28.250 --> 33:30.542
I wasn't sure we could really
pull it off.

33:32.250 --> 33:33.833
You're sure it's done?

33:33.917 --> 33:37.417
(male #1)
'Earthforce One
will never return from Io.'

33:37.500 --> 33:40.125
'The power's now yours, Clark.'

33:40.208 --> 33:42.083
'Mr. President.'

33:46.125 --> 33:49.458
God, that's it, isn't it?

33:49.542 --> 33:51.833
[sighing]

33:51.917 --> 33:53.750
The proof we've been
looking for all this time

33:53.833 --> 33:57.083
and it practically
walks in the front door.

33:57.167 --> 33:59.250
The problem is, uh,
what are we gonna do about it?

33:59.333 --> 34:00.750
We can't release it ourselves.

34:00.833 --> 34:03.417
It'll raise too many questions
like how we got it

34:03.500 --> 34:05.542
and why were looking for it.

34:05.625 --> 34:07.750
I'll send it to General Hague.

34:07.833 --> 34:09.167
He'll get it to the right people
without it

34:09.250 --> 34:10.333
being tracked back to him.

34:10.417 --> 34:11.500
They'll say it's a fake.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.542
All high ranking
Earthforce comm systems

34:13.625 --> 34:16.625
carry an identifier code
on a sub channel.

34:16.708 --> 34:17.917
That code is kept top secret

34:18.000 --> 34:20.792
to prevent false orders
from being given.

34:20.875 --> 34:23.208
It can't be faked.

34:23.292 --> 34:27.625
And that code will tie this
right back to President Clark.

34:27.708 --> 34:29.875
This is the best chance
we ever had, Michael.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.125
We have to take it!

34:32.875 --> 34:35.792
[zapping]

34:40.958 --> 34:42.542
Do you always pace like that?

34:42.625 --> 34:44.917
Is there some way
you'd prefer me to pace?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.250
Damn it! I really don't
want to screw this up.

34:47.333 --> 34:48.833
Then don't.

34:48.917 --> 34:51.667
The Minbari taught me,
claim victory in your heart

34:51.750 --> 34:53.250
and the universe will follow.

34:53.333 --> 34:55.667
Fine, great, claim victory
in your heart and up your..

34:55.750 --> 34:57.250
[whirring]

34:58.542 --> 35:00.750
Zog!

35:00.833 --> 35:02.500
Zog?

35:02.583 --> 35:03.792
"Zog?"

35:03.875 --> 35:05.250
what?

35:05.333 --> 35:07.458
no?

35:07.542 --> 35:09.333
[dramatic music]

35:11.833 --> 35:13.250
It's leaving.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.333
means no.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.333
Like hell.

35:17.417 --> 35:19.708
I am not letting them leave here
without saying yes.

35:19.792 --> 35:23.292
Really? And how do you
propose stopping them?

35:23.375 --> 35:27.167
Perhaps a big red and white sign
with the word stop on it?

35:27.250 --> 35:28.542
I'll put a bucket
on my head and pretend

35:28.625 --> 35:30.708
to be the ancient
Vorlon God Boogee.

35:30.792 --> 35:32.583
- That's it!
- Fine, I'll get a bucket.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.917
No. I meant the Vorlons.
Open a comm channel, now!

35:39.208 --> 35:40.542
[device beeping]

35:40.625 --> 35:43.250
This is the White Star
to the departing ship.

35:44.958 --> 35:47.083
I just want to say
I appreciate your response

35:47.167 --> 35:48.958
and I fully understand.

35:49.042 --> 35:50.208
The Vorlons said
you wouldn't be up

35:50.292 --> 35:52.042
for a fight like this.

35:52.125 --> 35:53.458
In fact, they said
in the last war

35:53.542 --> 35:54.750
they carried you..

35:54.833 --> 35:56.208
...did most of the work

35:56.292 --> 35:57.833
while you took
most of the credit for it.

35:57.917 --> 36:00.625
[chuckling softly]
They said if you got involved
in this one

36:00.708 --> 36:01.833
you'd just get hurt.

36:01.917 --> 36:04.958
[dramatic music]

36:06.792 --> 36:08.292
Come to think of it..

36:08.375 --> 36:09.625
...we've got the Vorlons.

36:09.708 --> 36:12.208
We...we don't need
much more help, do we?

36:12.292 --> 36:15.625
I mean the Vorlons are really
pretty close to perfect.

36:15.708 --> 36:16.708
Aren't they?

36:16.792 --> 36:18.250
And strong. Phew.

36:18.333 --> 36:19.667
[rumbling]

36:19.750 --> 36:22.500
(male #2)
'Vorlon tavutna chog!'

36:22.583 --> 36:25.125
Yeah, well, whatever.

36:25.208 --> 36:26.667
Listen, I'll be sure
and give them your message

36:26.750 --> 36:28.250
as soon as I get back.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.875
In the meantime,
you have a nice flight.

36:32.167 --> 36:33.500
We'll be sure and send
you a message as soon

36:33.583 --> 36:34.917
as the fighting is over.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.333
So you can come back out again.

36:36.417 --> 36:39.083
[rumbling]

36:39.167 --> 36:41.792
- I think you're making him mad.
- Mm-hmm.

36:41.875 --> 36:44.042
- It's bigger than we are.
- I know.

36:45.083 --> 36:48.042
[dramatic music]

36:54.917 --> 36:58.375
When it is time,
come to this place.

36:58.458 --> 37:00.458
Call our name.

37:00.542 --> 37:02.042
We will be here.

37:05.542 --> 37:06.583
[sighing]

37:08.833 --> 37:11.792
[engine whirring]

37:12.792 --> 37:15.667
[pulsating]

37:15.750 --> 37:17.833
[electricity crackling]

37:24.042 --> 37:26.125
[instrumental music]

37:28.833 --> 37:30.625
(woman on TV)
'With the stunning
revelation today'

37:30.708 --> 37:32.250
of evidence purporting to show

37:32.333 --> 37:34.250
that the death
of President Santiago

37:34.333 --> 37:36.667
was not an accident
but an assassination

37:36.750 --> 37:38.000
planned from within

37:38.083 --> 37:40.500
and further
that then Vice President Clark

37:40.583 --> 37:43.042
was involved
in this alleged conspiracy.

37:43.125 --> 37:45.208
'The evidence is currently
undergoing tests'

37:45.292 --> 37:47.667
'designed to determine
its authenticity.'

37:47.750 --> 37:49.792
'Meanwhile, several senate
committees in Earthdome'

37:49.875 --> 37:52.458
will hold closed hearings
to discuss the issue

37:52.542 --> 37:54.000
and are strongly urging
the appointment

37:54.083 --> 37:56.667
'of a special prosecutor
to evaluate the evidence.'

37:56.750 --> 37:58.167
Off.

37:58.250 --> 37:59.833
Okay, you heard the news.

37:59.917 --> 38:01.458
I expect it to be tense
out there today.

38:01.542 --> 38:03.583
Just, uh, keep everybody calm.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.917
Oh, and, uh,
because of this situation

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
our new political
officer Julie Musante

38:08.083 --> 38:09.542
has been recalled
to Earth to help deal

38:09.625 --> 38:11.792
with the crisis
in public morale.

38:11.875 --> 38:14.250
So without her, uh,
guidance

38:14.333 --> 38:15.833
if anyone asks,
just say that we're waiting

38:15.917 --> 38:17.208
for the truth to come out

38:17.292 --> 38:19.667
because sooner or later
it always does.

38:19.750 --> 38:20.792
That's all.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.750
[indistinct chatter]

38:25.042 --> 38:27.500
[sighing]
That's amazing.
I can't believe it.

38:27.583 --> 38:29.125
It's gotta be a mistake, right?

38:29.208 --> 38:31.708
Yeah, well, we'll see. Huh?

38:31.792 --> 38:33.583
Is there something wrong, chief?

38:35.125 --> 38:36.708
Yeah.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.875
Yeah, there's something
wrong, Zack.

38:38.958 --> 38:41.500
- What did you tell her?
- What, Musante?

38:41.583 --> 38:43.083
[chuckling]
Nothin'.

38:43.167 --> 38:45.625
Come on, I know you
had a private meeting with her.

38:45.708 --> 38:47.333
I know she's been
asking questions.

38:47.417 --> 38:50.417
Look, I didn't tell
her anything.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.125
Okay, little stuff,
stupid stuff.

38:54.208 --> 38:55.375
Yeah, what am I supposed to do,
play dumb?

38:55.458 --> 38:56.958
I work for these people.

38:57.042 --> 38:58.667
Yeah, well, you were working
for me a hell of a long time

38:58.750 --> 39:00.458
before you joined Nightwatch.

39:00.542 --> 39:02.375
Now, look, after what happened
to me before

39:02.458 --> 39:06.333
it took a long time before
I could trust anyone again.

39:06.417 --> 39:07.958
I thought I could trust you.

39:09.250 --> 39:10.917
Don't make me have
any second thoughts, huh?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.417
You don't trust me, chief.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.167
- What are you talking about?
- What's a Code 7R, huh?

39:17.500 --> 39:19.917
I looked it up in the books.
It ain't there.

39:21.708 --> 39:23.792
So, I have to wonder..

39:25.667 --> 39:26.792
...what's going on?

39:28.833 --> 39:31.292
Nightwatch says the only people
who have to worry

39:31.375 --> 39:33.417
'are the ones
with something to hide.'

39:36.000 --> 39:38.458
You got something to hide,
chief?

39:38.542 --> 39:40.583
Look, you got a charge to make..

39:40.667 --> 39:41.833
...make it.

39:41.917 --> 39:43.458
Otherwise,
I don't have time for this.

39:43.542 --> 39:46.667
No, I don't have a charge
to make, damn it.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.250
I'm just trying to get through
this thing and it ain't easy.

39:49.333 --> 39:50.375
I'm walking a tightrope here.

39:50.458 --> 39:52.500
And I thought you'd understand.

39:53.375 --> 39:55.042
Boy, was I a jerk.

40:00.875 --> 40:03.125
Alright, I know
you're my superior officer

40:03.208 --> 40:04.750
and we have to work together.

40:06.333 --> 40:09.542
But for the rest of the day
just don't talk to me.

40:09.625 --> 40:10.875
We'll both be happier.

40:14.875 --> 40:16.250
[door whirring]

40:16.333 --> 40:17.250
So it went okay, then.

40:17.333 --> 40:19.458
No problem making first contact.

40:19.542 --> 40:22.333
No problem at all. They'll
be there when we need them.

40:22.417 --> 40:23.625
That's one down and what..

40:23.708 --> 40:24.875
...several thousand more to go?

40:24.958 --> 40:27.333
Yeah, well, if this
war's gonna be as bad

40:27.417 --> 40:31.167
as Delenn says, we'll need all
the First Ones we can find.

40:31.250 --> 40:33.500
Any more word on the situation
with President Clark?

40:34.917 --> 40:36.708
Earthdome is going nuts
over all this.

40:36.792 --> 40:39.708
Clark is saying it's an alien
plot to discredit him.

40:39.792 --> 40:42.292
Santiago's family
is demanding an investigation.

40:42.375 --> 40:43.500
I mean, it's a mess.

40:44.750 --> 40:45.833
But..

40:47.208 --> 40:48.958
...the truth is out.

40:49.042 --> 40:51.833
All we can do is hope
it does some good.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.000
I can't imagine
I'll be gone very long.

40:54.083 --> 40:56.042
This whole nonsense
about the President.

40:56.125 --> 40:57.958
This is exactly
the kind of thing

40:58.042 --> 40:59.667
that I was warning
you about, Zack.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.917
I hope you can see now
that I had a point.

41:02.750 --> 41:04.750
Yes, ma'am, uh..

41:04.833 --> 41:05.958
...it does seem that way.

41:07.542 --> 41:08.875
Just curious.

41:08.958 --> 41:11.042
You ever hear of a Code 7R?

41:11.125 --> 41:13.792
I thought
maybe it was a new security code

41:13.875 --> 41:16.208
something I might not
have access to.

41:16.292 --> 41:18.083
No, I've never heard of it. Why?

41:18.167 --> 41:20.500
[instrumental music]

41:20.583 --> 41:22.375
Ah, I don't know.

41:22.458 --> 41:23.875
I thought
maybe I heard it somewhere.

41:23.958 --> 41:26.792
- I...guess I was wrong.
- Hm.

41:33.417 --> 41:35.042
Well, that's my ship.

41:35.125 --> 41:36.833
So I'll see you
when we finish

41:36.917 --> 41:38.333
cleaning up this mess back home.

41:38.417 --> 41:41.750
Damage control is a great waste
of time, effort

41:41.833 --> 41:43.750
and resources, Mr. Allan.

41:43.833 --> 41:45.958
But sooner or later we'll find
whoever is responsible

41:46.042 --> 41:47.792
for this outrage..

41:47.875 --> 41:50.667
...and they'll be
punished...severely..

41:50.750 --> 41:51.792
...publicly..

41:51.875 --> 41:53.417
...and permanently.

Oh, hell.

42:11.083 --> 42:12.625
Just a second.

42:14.417 --> 42:16.417
Yeah.

42:16.500 --> 42:17.583
[sighing]

42:19.000 --> 42:20.417
Ow!

42:20.500 --> 42:22.125
Damn! Damn! Damn!

42:31.292 --> 42:33.208
I told you I could help.

42:34.208 --> 42:35.917
The book of G'Quon.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.292
Read it. We'll talk afterward.

42:37.375 --> 42:40.042
- Ah-ah, I don't read Narn.
- 'Learn!'

42:43.000 --> 42:44.083
He hates me.

42:45.542 --> 42:46.667
They all hate me.

42:47.750 --> 42:49.417
That's why they're doing this..
