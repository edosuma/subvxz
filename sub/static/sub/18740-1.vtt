00:21.121 --> 00:23.323
Hello. I should use a microphone, really.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.457
Hi.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.058
Oh, my God.

00:26.493 --> 00:27.561
Thank you.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.129
[mimics crying]

00:29.663 --> 00:31.665
[audience cheering]

00:31.732 --> 00:32.799
Thank you.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.703
Thank you.
That was the perfect amount of applause.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.239
I didn't have to stand here
too awkwardly long.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.174
Thank you for coming. I am Jen.

00:41.241 --> 00:45.212
If you didn't know, maybe you wandered in,
now you're having a fun time with me.

00:45.612 --> 00:46.652
- Um...
- [audience laughs]

00:47.547 --> 00:50.717
It has been brought to my attention
by doctors,

00:51.084 --> 00:54.087
some codependent yoga teachers,
and everyone who's ever met me

00:54.454 --> 00:55.455
that I am high strung.

00:56.089 --> 01:01.528
And... it's been suggested...
that therapy isn't enough,

01:01.762 --> 01:03.497
that I need to meditate.

01:04.431 --> 01:08.168
And so, now,
I am one of these people who meditates.

01:08.835 --> 01:12.739
And by "I meditate,"
I mean, "I do not ever meditate."

01:13.140 --> 01:14.808
- But...
- [audience laughs]

01:16.109 --> 01:20.347
I have a meditation playlist,
some gongs going, "gong, gong."

01:20.414 --> 01:23.283
I've got apps, I think about meditation.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.585
I have a meditation chair
in my living room.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.522
You have one, too.
It's just a fucking chair.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.723
- But...
- [audience laughs]

01:30.557 --> 01:34.294
I put a candle next to it
and I call it my meditation chair, yeah.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.397
And when you come over,
I point out to you,

01:37.464 --> 01:41.768
"Oh, don't mind that, that just, um...
That's my meditation chair, yeah.

01:42.169 --> 01:45.505
No, every morning I get up
and I think about doing it and I don't.

01:45.639 --> 01:49.242
I get up and I... sit in it
and take a few deep breaths.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.546
Don't be intimidated, you can sit in it
if you want. Yeah, it's not...

01:53.113 --> 01:55.115
Not everyone's
on the same spiritual plane,

01:55.182 --> 01:56.617
but we don't have any rules

01:56.683 --> 01:59.286
in this... happy home
with the chair and the...

01:59.353 --> 02:01.822
Don't worry about why the candle
has never been lit, just..."

02:01.888 --> 02:03.590
[audience laughs]

02:05.759 --> 02:09.162
But this one day, I did meditate
because I had an important thing to do.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.229
I wanted to get a job.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.799
I wanted to write
and I wanted someone to pay me for it.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.335
I wanted to have an interview
and I wanted to get it.

02:15.402 --> 02:18.305
So, that being said,
there were a little nerves in the morning.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.841
I thought
maybe I'll try this meditation thing

02:20.907 --> 02:22.476
that everyone is talking about.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.611
And I did about five minutes
of meditation.

02:25.412 --> 02:28.181
And if you're not impressed with that,
then you've never meditated.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.616
[audience laughs]

02:30.584 --> 02:34.554
Because after five seconds, you're like,
"Why did the Lord stop time?"

02:34.621 --> 02:36.390
[audience laughs]

02:37.691 --> 02:42.629
Five minutes is a long time
to clear your mind of things and I did it.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.499
And I woke up and came out of it
and I was like:

02:45.666 --> 02:49.736
"Oh, I get what everyone's talking about.
I feel... so...

02:49.803 --> 02:51.338
Like, I could handle anything.

02:51.405 --> 02:56.777
If I didn't have to leave the house today,
I could really handle anything."

02:58.311 --> 03:00.847
But I did have to leave the house.
And so, I got in my car

03:00.914 --> 03:03.950
and I'm driving
in the Los Angeles 9 a.m. traffic.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.753
When I saw the green light,
I was like, "Green's pretty."

03:06.820 --> 03:09.856
And I was trying to figure out
what green meant, like, on a deeper level.

03:09.923 --> 03:10.957
[audience laughs]

03:11.224 --> 03:13.326
And I'm like,
"Green, what can that tell me?"

03:13.393 --> 03:14.928
And I didn't realize in that moment,

03:15.195 --> 03:17.664
all I needed to know about green
is it means fucking go.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.300
And so, I'm, "Green,"
and I start to slow down.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.903
And the people behind me
are starting to lose it

03:22.969 --> 03:24.738
because they are late for work.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.841
And so they're just, "beep!"
and they're honking and their horns,

03:27.908 --> 03:31.678
and I'm like, "Oh, now it's yellow.
Oh, red. Oh, that was fun."

03:31.745 --> 03:35.682
And I realized... I'm stopped
at the red light, which is normal,

03:35.749 --> 03:39.453
but I really stopped at the green light.
And then I realized, "Oh, my God, I...

03:39.519 --> 03:42.289
I screwed these people."
That could've made the difference

03:42.355 --> 03:45.459
between them being early and being late.
Guy behind is pissed like:

03:46.359 --> 03:49.863
I see him in my rear-view mirror.
And I just... I feel so calm, though,

03:49.930 --> 03:51.832
because I meditated. Yeah, so...

03:51.898 --> 03:52.999
[audience laughs]

03:53.266 --> 03:57.604
I just turned and give him a wave
that just says like, "I'm so sorry.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.640
I'm sorry you think
you're late for work, but...

04:00.707 --> 04:02.709
[audience laughs]

04:04.010 --> 04:05.445
you don't know what I know.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.947
[audience laughs]

04:07.013 --> 04:09.783
- There is no time, so, yeah."
- [audience laughs]

04:10.450 --> 04:12.686
I'm even embarrassed to say
that I heard his horn.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.488
That's not very meditation of me.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.822
What is a sound, right? That's...

04:16.890 --> 04:18.257
[audience laughs]

04:18.325 --> 04:20.560
That's just the meaning
I placed on it, right?

04:20.627 --> 04:23.764
I could've heard anything.
I could've heard butterflies eating candy.

04:23.830 --> 04:27.434
So... I'm driving,
feeling really good about myself,

04:27.501 --> 04:30.704
and just, like... Just so much better
than everyone else that's so mad.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.974
And that's what meditation's for,
is to feel superior to others.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.648
- So...
- [audience laughs]

04:36.743 --> 04:39.646
I turned the corner
and we go to the next stoplight...

04:40.347 --> 04:43.517
and I pull up to it and so does the guy
behind me that was all pissed.

04:43.583 --> 04:47.053
And I've got the sunroof open,
the windows down.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.588
I'm just happy as can be.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.991
Again, did I mention
I had meditated that morning?

04:51.691 --> 04:52.793
And the guy next to me,

04:52.859 --> 04:55.595
typical what you think of Los Angeles
if you've never been.

04:55.662 --> 04:58.932
Producer-looking guy,
kind of chomping on his cigar,

04:58.999 --> 05:03.537
bald, kind of chubby, in his red BMW,
probably 50, two divorces.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.339
And he's sitting there
and he is pissed at me.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.042
And he's in his car...
and he just looks over and goes,

05:09.543 --> 05:12.479
"Hey, dumbass,
what were you doing at that light?"

05:13.947 --> 05:15.682
And I'm just sitting in my car like:

05:21.388 --> 05:22.556
"I meditated today.

05:22.622 --> 05:23.957
[audience laughs]

05:24.024 --> 05:25.024
Can't get angry.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.730
What would it be like to kill him?
Don't think about that."

05:30.797 --> 05:31.965
[audience laughs]

05:33.700 --> 05:36.836
So, he yells again, "Hey, dumbass,
what were you doing at that light?

05:36.903 --> 05:38.038
Texting your boyfriend?"

05:39.539 --> 05:40.539
That one got me.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.875
[audience laughs]

05:41.942 --> 05:44.844
Because I didn't have a boyfriend
and I was not happy about it.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.012
[audience laughs]

05:46.079 --> 05:49.082
Then I got pissed. I'm like,
"He thinks I'm texting my boyfriend?

05:49.349 --> 05:52.018
That's what he thinks
when a woman makes a mistake in traffic?

05:52.085 --> 05:54.821
It's always about a man.
Anytime you see a five-car pile up,

05:54.888 --> 05:58.091
it's like, 'Are you coming home for dinner
or not?'" You know?

05:58.358 --> 06:01.094
[audience laughs]

06:01.361 --> 06:03.563
So, I was like,
"This guy is not gonna bully me.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.566
Fuck this. I don't care about meditation.
Everybody gets angry.

06:06.633 --> 06:07.767
I'm not a goddamn saint."

06:07.834 --> 06:09.903
Not that they meditate,
but whatever they do.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.073
And so, I put the car in park
and I stood up in my seat

06:13.139 --> 06:16.776
and I put my head out of the sunroof
and then I went into the passenger seat.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.612
[audience laughs]

06:18.678 --> 06:21.815
And I leaned over and I went,
"What the fuck did you just say to me?"

06:21.881 --> 06:23.883
[audience laughs]

06:24.484 --> 06:26.453
[audience cheering]

06:29.856 --> 06:32.959
For those at home watching,
this isn't being taped in New York City.

06:33.426 --> 06:34.894
[audience laughs]

06:35.428 --> 06:38.798
He said, "I said, what were you doing
at that light, dumbass?"

06:38.865 --> 06:40.533
Now, I didn't wanna tell him,

06:41.001 --> 06:43.603
"I meditated today
and I got loopy at the green light."

06:43.670 --> 06:47.107
I didn't want to tell him that because he
was mean to me and I wanted to win.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.642
[audience laughs]

06:48.708 --> 06:51.611
I wanted to say something
that would make him feel so bad

06:51.745 --> 06:54.848
about what he did that he'd be like,
"Oh, my God, I have to think

06:54.914 --> 06:57.617
before I speak
and put myself in other people's shoes.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.453
You never know
what someone's going through." Right?

07:01.655 --> 07:04.824
So, I said to him something that's true,
meaning, I actually said it.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.459
The content is not true.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.461
[audience laughs]

07:08.828 --> 07:11.698
I said, "What was I doing? I was thinking.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.768
I just found out that my mother died
this morning."

07:14.834 --> 07:15.902
[audience laughs]

07:15.969 --> 07:18.705
I didn't say I was a good person,
I just said I meditated.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.206
[audience laughs]

07:21.107 --> 07:23.176
He goes, "You're still a dumbass."
And I was like:

07:23.443 --> 07:24.444
[gasps]

07:24.511 --> 07:28.081
"What kind of person says that to someone
whose mother just died?"

07:28.148 --> 07:30.583
She didn't, he doesn't know.
He is a bad person.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.953
- I am the winner in this story still.
- [audience laughs]

07:34.921 --> 07:36.523
And then I just lost it.

07:36.589 --> 07:39.759
And I went, "Oh, go fuck your car."

07:40.226 --> 07:41.995
[audience laughs]

07:42.062 --> 07:44.497
I don't know what that means either,
but I just...

07:45.565 --> 07:47.901
I had to keep going,
like I knew what I was talking about.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.470
Like, "Yeah, stick your dick
in the tailpipe, buddy.

07:50.537 --> 07:51.938
[audience laughs]

07:52.005 --> 07:54.040
I know who you are.
What are you, a producer?

07:54.107 --> 07:57.644
Divorced? You had two wives
and left both of them for your assistant.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.947
And what, you...? You tell young girls
you're gonna put them in movies?

08:01.014 --> 08:03.817
You don't have any movies to put them in.
You're a loser."

08:03.883 --> 08:06.619
- And the light turned green and he...
- [audience laughs]

08:06.686 --> 08:08.688
The light turned green and he drove off.

08:08.755 --> 08:11.491
That's what you do at green lights,
you drive away.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.530
So, as he drives off, he screams,
"You're crazy." And I was like:

08:17.597 --> 08:18.765
[gasps, then exhales]

08:20.066 --> 08:23.636
And I screamed out of the...
Out of the passenger seat sunroof:

08:25.005 --> 08:28.808
"I'm not crazy.
I meditated today, motherfucker."

08:29.275 --> 08:31.644
[audience laughing, then cheering]

08:31.711 --> 08:32.711
Thank you.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.815
Which is an ancient chant from the Buddha.

08:35.881 --> 08:39.652
So... But then I thought...
My adrenaline's going, I'm shaking.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.956
And I went, "Holy shit, all this happened
and I meditated today.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.858
What if I hadn't, you know?"

08:44.924 --> 08:46.760
[audience laughs]

08:48.228 --> 08:51.631
And just a little lesson for you guys,
do not call a woman crazy

08:51.698 --> 08:55.869
unless you wanna see a woman
go fucking crazy, okay? Just don't.

08:55.935 --> 08:59.272
Save yourselves. If you wanna see...
If you wanna tell a woman she's crazy,

08:59.539 --> 09:00.240
just call her calm.

09:00.306 --> 09:03.543
It'll just throw us off
and the whole thing's dissipated. Just go,

09:03.610 --> 09:05.578
"Hey, you're being really calm right now."

09:06.246 --> 09:09.315
"Oh, thank you. A psychic told me
I was calm once. Thanks.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.986
What were we fighting about?
I didn't even know."

09:13.186 --> 09:16.322
So... I'm driving and I'm like:

09:16.589 --> 09:18.792
"Okay, just calm down.
Adrenaline's coming down."

09:19.692 --> 09:22.228
I get to the next stoplight.
This stoplight never changes.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.965
The guy is there again and I'm like,
"Okay, don't start anything, Jen.

09:26.032 --> 09:30.170
Stay in your lane
and, literally, do not be or seem crazy."

09:30.770 --> 09:34.207
So, I put on some music
and I'm bopping around happy as can be.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.042
"Look at me, I'm not crazy at all.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.578
I wasn't just screaming,
'I meditated, motherfucker.'

09:38.645 --> 09:39.846
I am fun and happy."

09:40.747 --> 09:43.583
And he's kind of looking at me
and he yells into my car,

09:43.650 --> 09:46.152
"Hey... sorry about your mom."

09:46.986 --> 09:49.122
And I'm like,
"Oh, fuck, I forgot my mom died."

09:49.189 --> 09:50.189
And so, you know...

09:57.931 --> 09:59.332
I suddenly get real upset, I go:

10:00.133 --> 10:04.904
"Oh, I know, it's been a tough morning.
So much paperwork."

10:04.971 --> 10:06.639
What? I don't know... What is...?

10:07.373 --> 10:10.243
Why would there be paperwork so soon,
an hour?

10:11.211 --> 10:13.947
If it's real,
she lives in Boston, I live in L.A.,

10:14.247 --> 10:17.016
she died an hour ago, there's paperwork,
do I have a fax machine

10:17.083 --> 10:19.252
that's like, "Someone died, come on,"
you know?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.889
And so, he looks at me and goes,

10:22.956 --> 10:26.226
"Well, love, we got kind of heated,
but I hope you have a good day

10:26.292 --> 10:28.895
whatever you're doing."
And I'm like, "You, too, man."

10:28.995 --> 10:31.998
And he drives off and I start sobbing.
I'm like, "Oh, my God.

10:32.365 --> 10:36.002
So full of emotion, you know. I don't know
if it's just my mom or just... I...

10:38.905 --> 10:42.308
It just kind of... You know, I've talked
to two people this morning already

10:42.375 --> 10:44.978
and I would never do that,
but that's the meditation,

10:45.044 --> 10:46.379
it brings us together.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.648
It's so powerful."

10:48.848 --> 10:50.016
So, then I parked the car.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.252
I'm no longer crying, or passionate,
or crazy,

10:52.318 --> 10:54.187
or condescending because I'm meditating.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.724
And I walk in into this meeting,
introduce myself, we have a chitchat,

10:57.790 --> 11:00.894
they're gonna pay me,
I'm gonna do the job, I nailed it.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.996
I'm like,
"I shouldn't be allowed to do that.

11:03.229 --> 11:06.733
I should not be allowed to act normal
'cause I was acting like a maniac."

11:07.267 --> 11:09.702
How come they don't have to know
what I was doing.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.272
You're allowed into a building
and be whatever you want

11:12.338 --> 11:15.742
even though you were screaming.
I can't believe we do that, but we do.

11:15.808 --> 11:18.678
I'm like, "But registered sex offenders
don't get to do that."

11:18.745 --> 11:21.147
I feel like, I should...
When I get crazy like that,

11:21.214 --> 11:23.683
I should be treated
like a registered sex offender.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.186
Like, they have to go door-to-door.
"I'm your neighbor.

11:27.253 --> 11:30.156
I have things in my past."
Like, I should have to go to a meeting,

11:30.223 --> 11:33.860
like, "Hello, I'm a nice person,
but I just screamed, 'I meditated today, '

11:33.927 --> 11:36.963
in the middle of the road and..."
But I got away with it.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.766
It's like...
If you've ever been going to a party

11:39.832 --> 11:43.436
and you're in the car with your partner
and just... You hate them and you're like:

11:43.836 --> 11:45.171
"That outfit doesn't match.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.808
What's so funny is you talk
about how much you love your mom

11:48.875 --> 11:51.477
and she used to put you in these outfits.
She fucking sucked

11:51.744 --> 11:53.112
at teaching you how to dress.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.883
Oh, yeah, I am gonna start in on your mom.
Oh, yeah, I am. Oh, yes, I am.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.718
Oh, no. No, don't even... No, no, no.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.120
Know what?
I wanna go to this party for five minutes

12:01.187 --> 12:04.123
and I don't wanna look at you.
They're my friends, not yours."

12:04.190 --> 12:07.060
Then you walk in, "Hey,
I brought muffins," and you're like...

12:10.096 --> 12:12.332
You wanna stay all night.
"Aren't we having fun?"

12:12.398 --> 12:14.467
He's in the corner
and your friends are like:

12:14.734 --> 12:17.203
"Isn't she great?"
And he's like, "She's fucking great."

12:19.172 --> 12:22.342
And you get back in the car
and you forget about the fight from before

12:22.408 --> 12:25.311
and you're like,
"Weren't those muffins great? I'm great."

12:25.378 --> 12:29.315
And he's just looking at you like,
"Shut up. I know who you really are."

12:33.119 --> 12:34.354
[sighs]

12:35.021 --> 12:38.257
I know you can probably sense
I'm a bit of a badass. Um...

12:39.525 --> 12:43.096
Not... I don't mean because of that story,
but you can tell I have a tattoo.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.162
I know you can.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.365
Um...

12:45.431 --> 12:47.367
I have... Not everyone gets one, you know.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.436
There's badasses
and the rest of you and, um...

12:51.004 --> 12:54.073
But I have a tattoo
and I'm only gonna have one.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.509
I think the whole tattoo thing
is a lot like kids.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.511
Like, first of all, some people want one,

12:58.778 --> 13:01.914
some people want none,
some people want a bunch, like...

13:01.981 --> 13:05.051
And it's all over their arms
and it looks like a lot of work. But...

13:06.019 --> 13:09.422
But you go to a place, you lay down,
there's a lot of pain and you're like:

13:09.489 --> 13:11.524
"God, I hope I love it. It is permanent."

13:11.791 --> 13:12.791
So...

13:15.261 --> 13:19.032
So, I'm having a tattoo
instead of a child.

13:19.098 --> 13:22.168
And... So, for me,
I'm one of the one-and-doner types.

13:22.235 --> 13:26.039
So, you know that my tattoo
has to be very meaningful, right? If...

13:26.105 --> 13:29.809
If you've ever thought about getting
a tattoo, you think about it for a while.

13:29.876 --> 13:33.479
"I don't wanna get something dumb. I have
to have something that means something."

13:33.546 --> 13:37.216
And I've been waiting my whole life
to find something succinct

13:37.283 --> 13:40.053
that means something
that I can put on my body permanently.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.922
I thought of something
a couple of years ago and I was like:

13:43.056 --> 13:44.524
"Don't do it, give it another year

13:44.590 --> 13:47.593
and if you're still thinking about it,
do it." That's what I did.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.562
And I was inspired by my friend

13:49.896 --> 13:53.299
who got a tattoo of her grandfather's name
on her wrist and his birthday

13:53.366 --> 13:55.201
because he has an amazing story, so...

13:56.102 --> 13:58.571
My... My friend's grandfather
survived the Holocaust

13:58.838 --> 13:59.839
because he was a Nazi.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.273
But...

14:01.407 --> 14:02.475
No, that's... Okay.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.444
Sorry.

14:05.912 --> 14:06.912
That...

14:12.351 --> 14:14.253
That's just a fun joke. That is not...

14:17.623 --> 14:20.860
I didn't set you guys up,
there really is a story about my friend.

14:21.928 --> 14:23.596
I just had to throw in because he was...

14:23.863 --> 14:25.998
My friend's grandfather
survived the Holocaust.

14:26.065 --> 14:29.302
And my friend, just like her father
and her father's father,

14:29.369 --> 14:33.005
and like many of us in this country,
suffers from depression and anxiety.

14:33.072 --> 14:37.310
And the story he would tell
was the survival story of his mind.

14:37.577 --> 14:42.281
When he was in the camps,
he would say a prayer of gratitude to God

14:42.348 --> 14:45.184
and say, "I don't...
If this has to end this way, fine,

14:45.585 --> 14:49.155
but thank you for making me me
and not one of the evil people.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.959
Thank you for putting love in my heart."
And that is mind-blowing.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.495
Of course you put that guy's name
on your wrist.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.296
The most beautiful story I've heard.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.532
And I don't have anyone in my family
like that.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.566
I...

15:04.904 --> 15:08.107
I come from a family of Catholic people
from Boston

15:08.174 --> 15:10.610
and we don't talk to God like that.

15:11.611 --> 15:15.615
We don't like God. We are mad at God
and we assume he's mad at us.

15:15.681 --> 15:19.652
"Jennifer, why would you have gratitude
for a bad thing that happened?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.155
That means God's mad... Mad at you.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.221
He's punishing you.

15:23.990 --> 15:27.960
Jennifer, why would you have gratitude
for God being so mean to you?

15:28.394 --> 15:31.697
Maybe he'll think you like it there
and he'll keep you in there.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.535
We're not bothering God
with all this gratitude

15:35.601 --> 15:37.170
unless something good happens.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.173
Nothing bad's ever happened in our family,
but it could

15:40.239 --> 15:43.342
and we're gonna complain in advance
and we're gonna stay vigilant.

15:43.409 --> 15:47.146
So, no tattoos
of anything our family said, please."

15:49.715 --> 15:51.083
So, I had to go elsewhere.

15:51.150 --> 15:54.720
So, I'll show you my... My tattoo...
and then I'll explain.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.489
- [man yells]
- Thank you.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.492
It's on my ankle. It's on my ankle.

16:04.363 --> 16:08.067
It says, "JKL,"
which stands for JK living,

16:08.201 --> 16:10.102
which stands for just keep living,

16:10.269 --> 16:12.638
which is Matthew McConaughey's
catchphrase.

16:16.175 --> 16:17.175
Thank you.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.715
This tattoo
could not be less ironic at all.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.718
I mean it with all my heart.

16:27.253 --> 16:30.022
Just keep living... inspires me.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.291
And I'm not suicidal.

16:35.127 --> 16:38.164
But I am a soul trapped in a body.
I didn't ask to be born

16:38.231 --> 16:41.300
and I'm afraid to die.
And that's the shit I live in every day.

16:42.635 --> 16:43.503
And so...

16:43.569 --> 16:45.338
- [audience cheering]
- [man] Yeah.

16:47.073 --> 16:51.410
I love what you get excited about.
"Yeah, that's right. We're trapped!"

16:54.580 --> 16:58.518
Before you judge, or if you think I'm just
some shallow Hollywood person. No, no, no.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.586
There's a story behind "just keep living."

17:01.320 --> 17:04.624
Just like my friend had a story
behind her tattoo of her grandfather.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.794
So, I'm at the nail salon
and I'm having a bad day...

17:10.229 --> 17:13.266
but I don't know why I'm having a bad day.
I just don't feel good.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.300
Physically, I feel fine.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.036
Mentally, not into it.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.473
So, I'm scrolling through
<i>People</i> magazine

17:21.107 --> 17:23.242
and I see an article
about Matthew McConaughey.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.579
Well, he had a tough day once, too.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.386
I'm not sure why you're laughing.
This is very serious.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.191
He was filming <i>Dazed and Confused</i>
and he knew he was going to be a big star,

17:39.425 --> 17:41.427
but his father is dying, so, he was like:

17:41.827 --> 17:45.298
"Something good and something bad
is happening at the same time.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.368
Well, I guess I better just keep living."

17:50.836 --> 17:52.605
And then that became his catchphrase.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.575
And I see
you're not as moved to silence by it

17:55.641 --> 17:57.543
as you were the Holocaust story.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.212
And that's fine.
Different things for different people.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.585
The thing about this tattoo
is it's in an inconvenient place.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.554
If my friend is having a bad day,
she can remind herself,

18:08.621 --> 18:11.457
"Not as bad as my grandfather had it,"
by going like this.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.725
I have to be like:

18:14.193 --> 18:18.197
"I will board this plane in a minute,
I'm having a bad day,

18:18.264 --> 18:21.434
and I need a reminder...
Go... Go ahead. Go. Go ahead."

18:25.771 --> 18:29.675
People say things about tattoos like,
"You're gonna regret it. It looks dumb."

18:29.742 --> 18:32.812
I'm like, "It looks dumb now,
I'm all set. Thank you."

18:38.150 --> 18:42.221
I got the, uh... I actually got the tattoo
on my birthday last year.

18:42.755 --> 18:46.125
Didn't do anything fun for my birthday
this year. Got a gift from mom.

18:46.192 --> 18:49.528
It wasn't my only gift,
but she handed me this piece of paper.

18:49.595 --> 18:50.630
[chuckles] Um...

18:51.430 --> 18:53.566
She does that now
that she's getting older.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.702
I don't know if she's made a will,
but she seems to send me things

18:56.769 --> 19:00.373
and hand me things whenever I see her
and it's always a dramatic speech.

19:00.439 --> 19:03.409
"Jennifer, I had to give this to you

19:03.476 --> 19:06.612
because if I die
how would you know I had it?"

19:08.481 --> 19:12.218
I go, "I'm gonna ransack the house.
Yeah, I'll get everything, don't worry."

19:15.254 --> 19:17.623
But she give me this thing
and it is as old as I am.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.858
It is 42 years old.

19:18.924 --> 19:22.428
It is the piece of paper they gave her
when she left the hospital with me

19:22.495 --> 19:23.629
when I was a little baby.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.366
I know, so cute. I was 7 and a half pounds
when I was born. So thin.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.439
Now I am 42 years old
and I've been over this before,

19:33.506 --> 19:37.410
you know, when we talk about
complimenting women and men, too,

19:37.476 --> 19:39.879
of telling people they look young.
It's a scary thing.

19:39.945 --> 19:43.282
Do not do this to people, okay?
Stop complimenting people by saying,

19:43.416 --> 19:45.351
"You don't look your age." Don't do that.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.486
I don't like
when women in their 20s are like:

19:47.553 --> 19:51.290
"Oh, my God, I thought you were my age."
Not a compliment. I've been in my 20s.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.326
I don't wanna look like
I have four roommates and shitty towels.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.429
I don't wanna look like that. So...

19:56.495 --> 19:57.815
- [audience cheering]
- Thank you.

20:00.666 --> 20:03.969
I'm the only one I know that loves
being called "ma'am." I love it. I...

20:04.236 --> 20:06.238
Whenever someone goes,
"Your change, ma'am,"

20:06.305 --> 20:08.240
I'm like, "You noticed. Thank you. Yeah.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.545
I have had a really rich and storied life.
Yeah. I, um...

20:13.546 --> 20:14.847
No, I've got time to tell you.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.818
I had a pager, sure, yeah. I...

20:19.752 --> 20:22.855
I was a cashier before scan technology,
made change in my head.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.959
And I was around when Bruce Willis
thought he should record an R&B album.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.226
So, yeah.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.930
Survivor, seen a lot. Thanks."

20:31.764 --> 20:33.299
Anyways, my mom gives me this.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.336
This is all they gave you in the '70s
when you had a child,

20:37.403 --> 20:40.473
a living thing that you had
to take care of. Not even 8-by-10.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.574
"Here you go. Bye."

20:42.808 --> 20:44.310
This I found very strange.

20:44.376 --> 20:49.515
It says, "Friends and relatives,
these people are interested in your baby."

20:50.783 --> 20:51.783
Oh, thank you.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.821
"And they want to hold and hug him."

20:56.555 --> 20:58.290
Oh, they didn't have girls in the '70s.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.363
"We must caution you
to keep visitors away from your baby.

21:04.797 --> 21:08.033
The newborn baby is best kept
as much to himself as possible."

21:08.734 --> 21:11.904
Which is different than now.
I go to my friends' houses, they're like:

21:11.971 --> 21:15.608
"Look at the baby, swaddle the baby,
you can breastfeed the baby. It's fine."

21:17.576 --> 21:20.713
But in the '70s, it's just like,
"Joyce, didn't you have a baby?"

21:20.780 --> 21:21.914
"Yeah, three months ago."

21:22.381 --> 21:24.316
"Where is he?" "He's in the other room.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.018
We haven't taken him out yet.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.920
You know, they say, the doctor says

21:28.287 --> 21:30.689
too much looking, and touching,
and fussing, it...

21:30.790 --> 21:34.527
It can lead to a sense of well-being,
so we don't want that, we're just gonna...

21:34.760 --> 21:35.661
Don't look at him."

21:35.728 --> 21:36.728
But...

21:37.530 --> 21:41.534
This is my favorite part, we might have to
go over it twice if there's any confusion.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.903
It explains crying. Why does a baby cry?

21:43.969 --> 21:46.872
Well, he's too hot, he's too hungry,
he's too thirsty. We got it.

21:47.706 --> 21:48.706
Here's one.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.044
"If it is less than three hours
from the feeding,

21:52.812 --> 21:56.715
check to make sure
there are no pins sticking in him.

21:58.918 --> 21:59.918
And change him."

22:02.521 --> 22:04.723
So, I'll explain for anyone very young.

22:06.058 --> 22:11.564
Velcro, although invented in the '40s,
was something they didn't put on diapers.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.732
I don't know
if they didn't put it on diapers.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.435
We didn't have Velcro diapers
in the '70s in my house.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.905
Whenever we didn't have something,
we were told it wasn't invented yet.

22:19.972 --> 22:23.709
I'd be like, "Can we get a microwave?"
My parents were like, "Not invented yet."

22:23.776 --> 22:27.046
I'm like, "Oh, my God, I must be
so genius. How did I know there was...?"

22:29.515 --> 22:32.518
But we... We did not have Velcro diapers.

22:32.585 --> 22:36.689
Back then, you'd wear a cloth diaper and
then they'd put safety pins to keep it on.

22:36.755 --> 22:39.592
So, that's fine.
Make sure no pins are sticking in him.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.027
But why must you wait three hours?

22:43.495 --> 22:44.495
Can't you...?

22:45.431 --> 22:46.732
Can't you feed the baby,

22:46.932 --> 22:50.402
put him down in the other room
where no friends or family can see him...

22:51.537 --> 22:54.840
If five minutes goes by, can you check
and see if there's no pins in him?

22:54.907 --> 22:57.387
If there aren't, then go,
"I guess he's gonna cry for a while."

22:57.443 --> 22:59.478
But, no, this says three hours.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.749
You could see a movie in three hours.
But you don't have a VCR back then.

23:03.816 --> 23:07.019
So, you have to go to a movie
and you can come all the way back,

23:07.086 --> 23:09.755
and have 15 minutes left
before you check on your kid.

23:09.822 --> 23:13.726
"Should we check on him?" "It says three
hours. We don't wanna be smothering."

23:13.792 --> 23:17.563
"You're right, we got 15. Make me a drink,
then we'll go in, I'm gonna..." So...

23:19.498 --> 23:22.601
I basically know
that I was just thrown in another room

23:22.701 --> 23:24.470
with pins sticking in me growing up.

23:25.938 --> 23:29.008
Which is why I'm so comfortable
being alone and I do acupuncture.

23:29.508 --> 23:30.508
But, um...

23:31.844 --> 23:35.814
I travel alone,
I went to Italy by myself this year.

23:35.881 --> 23:39.551
And it invoked a lot of reactions
from people.

23:40.019 --> 23:43.022
You would have thought I said,
"I started a race riot this year."

23:43.088 --> 23:45.824
People were like, "What? You did what?"

23:47.059 --> 23:50.195
People are very freaked out
with being alone.

23:50.829 --> 23:53.832
Like, I love being alone.
I think it's great.

23:53.899 --> 23:55.634
People are like, "How do you do it?"

23:55.801 --> 23:59.605
How do I decide that I don't like other
people and make sure I'm not around them?

23:59.672 --> 24:01.940
Pretty easy. People are like:

24:02.007 --> 24:03.727
"I don't even wanna go
to the movies alone."

24:03.876 --> 24:05.911
Why would you wanna go
with another person?

24:05.978 --> 24:08.614
What can you do at the movies
with another person

24:08.681 --> 24:10.516
besides jerk them off or something?

24:10.582 --> 24:12.785
There's nothing to do at the movies.

24:13.218 --> 24:14.219
And I'm a grown woman.

24:14.486 --> 24:18.123
I don't care if people think
I'm a loser for being alone.

24:18.190 --> 24:21.727
I was excited for this trip before people
started putting a damper on it.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.896
My dad was saying,
"Aren't you afraid of ISIS?

24:23.962 --> 24:25.864
ISIS is everywhere. Be afraid of ISIS."

24:25.931 --> 24:29.902
I was like, "Who... I'm a woman.
I don't have time to be afraid of ISIS.

24:29.968 --> 24:33.038
I'm just busy being afraid of
plain old men. Are you kidding me?"

24:34.139 --> 24:38.077
You ever walked by a bar at 1 a.m. when
dudes in baseball hats are getting out?

24:38.143 --> 24:40.179
Fuck ISIS. ISIS are adorable.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.682
ISIS have costumes and beards,
look like bartenders.

24:43.749 --> 24:46.051
ISIS, they're not...
I'm not afraid of them at all.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.218
So...

24:48.754 --> 24:51.824
I'm packing for my trip and I'm thinking
like, "Where should I go?"

24:51.890 --> 24:55.928
Like, you know, I'm making list of, like,
where I'm gonna see and what I'm gonna do.

24:55.994 --> 24:59.498
Then I Googled just at the last minute,
'cause I booked a trip to Venice.

24:59.565 --> 25:00.565
I just Googled,

25:00.632 --> 25:03.669
"What are the safest places in Italy
where woman don't get raped?"

25:03.736 --> 25:06.205
- [man] Oh!
- "Oh! Oh! She said rape."

25:06.271 --> 25:08.273
Let me fucking tell you something.

25:08.540 --> 25:11.340
Rape exists, I'm gonna talk about it.
That's not a joke, that's a fact.

25:11.543 --> 25:13.779
I looked that up
because I didn't wanna get raped.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.081
I'll stop talking about rape
when men stop raping.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.817
So, don't give me your little outrage,
"Ooh, oh, oh!"

25:18.884 --> 25:20.119
- [audience cheering]
- So...

25:22.287 --> 25:25.824
But it's true, there are websites
for this stuff. Well, it's just Yelp.

25:25.891 --> 25:30.028
There should be... There should be "Relp"
for like, "Where will I get raped? Help."

25:30.095 --> 25:31.597
And so you go on that website.

25:31.797 --> 25:34.233
So... I felt very safe in Venice,

25:34.299 --> 25:37.770
and if anyone cares I came out of it
unscathed, it was a very safe time.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.104
But people were saying to me:

25:39.171 --> 25:42.007
"Wouldn't you rather wait
and go with a man?"

25:42.775 --> 25:46.545
Not for safety, just it's not fun to go,
I guess, without a man.

25:46.779 --> 25:50.149
And I'm in a relationship
and that's what shocked people more.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.850
"Why isn't he going?"

25:52.251 --> 25:55.587
'Cause I'm a comedian, I happen
to be in Europe for some work anyway.

25:55.654 --> 25:58.257
I thought I'd just jaunt over
to Italy for a couple days,

25:58.323 --> 26:01.760
and he has a job
and so he can't just do that.

26:01.827 --> 26:04.730
And they're like, "He's abusive."
I'm like, "No, no, he just...

26:06.632 --> 26:09.101
He just has a different job,
and I have free time, and...

26:09.168 --> 26:12.838
It'd be a waste to not go to Italy,
it's just two hours away."

26:12.905 --> 26:15.741
And they're like,
"He should be by your side for this."

26:15.808 --> 26:18.110
I'm like, "It's not chemo.
I'm just going on a trip.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.678
I'm just going on a trip.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.114
It's all good, they have food there,
they have wine,

26:22.181 --> 26:25.350
they have people that talk,
it's just like here, it's just like here."

26:27.286 --> 26:28.587
But I don't understand.

26:28.654 --> 26:31.256
Obviously, you wanna sometimes
spend time with your partner.

26:31.323 --> 26:36.261
But traveling... Why risk the relationship?
Why travel with a partner, right?

26:36.995 --> 26:40.732
I went to Paris once with my husband.
Guess what, now he's my ex-husband. It...

26:42.067 --> 26:44.036
You don't have to travel
with your partner.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.673
It's the time that you see them
24 hours a day

26:47.739 --> 26:49.308
and everything they do, you're like:

26:49.374 --> 26:53.612
"Why are you walking on the plane
using your legs? God!"

26:54.279 --> 26:55.747
[groans]

26:56.281 --> 26:59.718
When you travel alone, you can eat
with your hands. I don't mean pizza.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.321
I was eating a salad.
I would rub it on. It was great.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.326
The only thing that sucked about my trip,

27:07.960 --> 27:10.262
and I hate to complain
about such a privileged thing

27:10.329 --> 27:11.964
as to go to Italy by myself,

27:12.664 --> 27:15.334
is that I booked a walking tour
'cause I love that stuff.

27:15.968 --> 27:20.839
And I booked the ghost tours of Venice,
which I thought was gonna be so fun.

27:20.906 --> 27:23.408
I was reading the website,
people were leaving comments.

27:23.675 --> 27:26.378
"It was so fun,
then a theater troupe jumped out at us

27:26.645 --> 27:28.080
and they tried to scare us

27:28.146 --> 27:32.684
and we saw sites where people
got slaughtered back in the 1700s,

27:32.751 --> 27:34.253
we heard these crazy ghost stories

27:34.319 --> 27:37.422
and we saw secret canals
and secret this and secret that."

27:37.689 --> 27:40.092
And I was like,
"I want that. I want all the secrets."

27:40.158 --> 27:41.293
So, I signed up for it.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.329
And it was my last night in Venice.

27:44.396 --> 27:48.901
And so at the last minute, I checked
my e-mail confirmation from the company.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.270
And I had accidentally booked
a private tour.

27:51.336 --> 27:55.440
And I was like, "No. No."
Thank you for understanding.

27:55.707 --> 27:58.143
"I don't wanna walk alone with someone
for 90 minutes.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.745
That's my worst nightmare."

28:00.145 --> 28:03.815
And they make me meet him on the bridge,
like some romance story.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.352
And he sees me and he goes,
"Is it just you?"

28:07.419 --> 28:08.353
And I go, "Yeah."

28:08.420 --> 28:11.223
And he goes,
"Oh, this breaks my heart."

28:11.290 --> 28:13.058
And he was doing this big thing.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.361
"I don't wanna give you
the ghost story tour.

28:16.428 --> 28:19.231
Oh, it's too sad. You're alone in Venice.

28:19.298 --> 28:23.769
Oh, no, no, no.
We do the love story tour."

28:23.835 --> 28:26.171
I go, "I wanna see where people
got murdered.

28:26.238 --> 28:29.241
Tell me about dead babies.
I wanna hear all kinds of crazy shit."

28:32.010 --> 28:33.912
And he asked, "Where is the man?"

28:33.979 --> 28:37.382
I don't know if he meant my boyfriend
or "the man" that's coming down on us.

28:37.449 --> 28:41.086
I'm like, "If I knew where 'the man' was,
we'd all be free," right? And so...

28:42.821 --> 28:46.491
I didn't know what he was talking about.
He was very concerned, I had to explain,

28:47.125 --> 28:51.296
"I'm in a..." You know, like all walking
tours start this way, you explain.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.232
You're in a relationship, very happy.

28:53.298 --> 28:55.867
You're just taking sometime alone.
Don't worry.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.337
And then I got down on my knees
and screamed:

28:58.403 --> 29:00.038
"Why, God, I miss him!

29:00.105 --> 29:03.308
I haven't seen a penis in a week!
Oh, God!"

29:04.977 --> 29:06.311
But then we started the tour.

29:08.113 --> 29:11.250
But when... The other problem...
Not just being a woman with a man.

29:11.350 --> 29:14.519
When you're anybody with anybody,
when you're alone on a walking tour,

29:14.786 --> 29:17.522
they can start taking advantage of you.
So, he was like, "Miss,

29:17.789 --> 29:21.293
if you don't mind, I don't feel so much
like walking tonight."

29:21.360 --> 29:23.128
I'm like, "You picked the wrong job."

29:23.195 --> 29:26.064
He's like, "I'm a little tired.

29:26.131 --> 29:30.102
It's been a hard day.
I am sad and it's hot.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.204
Could we stand here?"

29:32.271 --> 29:33.205
And so I said yes.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.240
I stood under a bridge with a man

29:35.440 --> 29:38.043
while he told me stories
that were not ghost stories

29:39.011 --> 29:41.046
for 90 minutes, okay?

29:42.447 --> 29:44.416
And I knew
the inevitable was gonna happen.

29:44.483 --> 29:45.917
I knew it was gonna happen.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.987
He asked me... why I was in Italy.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.990
And I said, "For vacation."
He said, "But why alone?"

29:52.057 --> 29:56.194
I said, "All right, I was in London
doing some work and I came here."

29:56.328 --> 29:57.829
"What work do you do?"

29:57.896 --> 29:59.965
And I...
I don't wanna tell him I'm a comedian.

30:00.399 --> 30:03.068
You guys, you're nice to comedians
when we're on stage,

30:03.135 --> 30:05.804
but in real life,
people say awful things to us.

30:06.271 --> 30:09.174
They find we're comedians
they're like, "You don't seem funny."

30:09.241 --> 30:11.510
"I'm getting my fucking colon removed,
that's why."

30:12.010 --> 30:13.010
So...

30:14.813 --> 30:17.949
I always have a lie whenever I check-in
to a hotel, get into an Uber.

30:18.016 --> 30:19.985
"What brings you to town?" Shuts them up.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.554
"My friend's having an abortion.
I had to come right in.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.195
And it's a guy
so it's a weird procedure,

30:30.262 --> 30:32.397
so just please leave me alone.
I don't wanna..."

30:33.899 --> 30:36.234
So, I just tell him I'm a comedian
and then he goes:

30:36.868 --> 30:40.072
"Madam, this is not a provocation...

30:41.506 --> 30:44.209
but your life
does not seem interesting enough

30:44.276 --> 30:46.511
that you have to go around the world
and tell it."

30:46.578 --> 30:47.946
[audience groans]

30:48.013 --> 30:49.147
And he's right, isn't he?

30:53.285 --> 30:56.521
And that was how the tour ended
is he said "not a provocation"

30:56.888 --> 30:58.924
and then gave me a big old provocation.

31:00.258 --> 31:01.860
And then he did one nice thing.

31:01.927 --> 31:04.329
I was trying to look at the positive,
I'm a meditator.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.400
Is he took me to an Italian restaurant.
Obviously, I was in Italy.

31:08.900 --> 31:12.104
He took me to a restaurant,
I don't have to say Italian restaurant.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.206
"Is this here an Italian restaurant
or what?"

31:14.272 --> 31:15.440
So, he took me...

31:18.143 --> 31:20.379
He took me to a restaurant.
He didn't sit with me,

31:20.445 --> 31:21.580
he just brought me there.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.916
And I was actually very grateful
because it was on the Grand Canal

31:24.983 --> 31:27.018
and if you've ever been to anywhere,

31:27.085 --> 31:30.389
you sometimes don't know
what's the authentic restaurant

31:30.455 --> 31:32.357
and what is the cheesy tourist place.

31:32.424 --> 31:35.026
And so, I said,
"I never would've picked this place.

31:35.093 --> 31:37.996
I had no idea by looking
at the restaurants on the Grand Canal

31:38.063 --> 31:41.333
what was authentic and what wasn't,
so, thank you for bringing me here."

31:41.400 --> 31:44.269
Now he's standing over my table,
waiter is bringing the wine,

31:44.336 --> 31:48.440
things are starting to happen and he says,
"May I tell you one more story, then?"

31:49.141 --> 31:50.275
I go, "Okay."

31:50.342 --> 31:53.178
He hadn't told me a ghost story yet,
so I was like, "Maybe this is it."

31:53.245 --> 31:58.984
He goes, "You remind me,
there's a story about perception.

31:59.451 --> 32:03.255
You bring up you don't know
what restaurant is good based on looks.

32:03.488 --> 32:04.623
Isn't that life?

32:05.957 --> 32:09.194
You don't know a man or a person,
just based on looking at them,

32:09.261 --> 32:10.262
what's in their soul.

32:10.462 --> 32:15.200
Maybe there's a man and he's fun
and he walks and he tells the stories.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.938
But then maybe he goes home
and he kills himself."

32:27.312 --> 32:29.281
"Is that it?" He goes, "Yes."

32:29.347 --> 32:32.184
I go, "Okay, well, have a good night.
Thanks for the tour."

32:35.053 --> 32:36.053
What...?

32:36.555 --> 32:37.556
"Just keep living."

32:41.293 --> 32:43.628
I was annoyed
because he never told the horror story.

32:43.695 --> 32:47.065
He only told me the love story.
I was like, "Oh, that's so... I don't...

32:47.132 --> 32:50.302
Not everyone's meant for this world.
Whatever he wants, I don't care."

32:51.036 --> 32:54.372
But I thought, maybe I should complain.
Like, I don't wanna get him fired,

32:54.439 --> 32:56.441
but I wanna complain
and get my money back

32:56.508 --> 32:59.344
and then just have the manager
just tell everyone,

32:59.411 --> 33:02.247
"Hey, you know, we can't mess around
with the tours.

33:02.314 --> 33:06.117
Give people what they want." So, maybe,
what if I call the manager right now?

33:06.184 --> 33:07.986
What if she was like, "Sergio?

33:08.220 --> 33:10.088
He did not meet you on the bridge at 7."

33:10.155 --> 33:11.223
I'd be like, "He did."

33:11.289 --> 33:14.459
She'd be like, "Oh, no, ma'am,
at 6:30 he killed himself."

33:14.526 --> 33:18.196
I'd be like, "Oh, my God,
that was the greatest ghost tour ever!"

33:21.299 --> 33:25.337
Yes. Now you like a suicide joke
when it has a little punch to it, right?

33:28.707 --> 33:31.576
So, you know, I'm a hypochondriac,
but not...

33:32.410 --> 33:33.645
I don't invent things.

33:33.712 --> 33:37.015
It's just that when something happens,
I think it's worse than it is, right?

33:37.082 --> 33:39.718
I had an incident with my doctor
six months ago...

33:40.452 --> 33:44.189
where she told me I couldn't come back
for a year even if I really was dying.

33:45.323 --> 33:48.260
Because I had
such a hypochondriacal episode...

33:48.527 --> 33:49.694
and made an ass of myself.

33:49.761 --> 33:53.331
Now, I wanna tell you the story,
but it's gonna be filmed...

33:54.199 --> 33:57.035
and now a cliché is gonna be stuck on me.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.771
Because the story also involves my period.

34:01.172 --> 34:04.042
And people have a problem
when women talk about their periods.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.677
"People." Men.

34:05.744 --> 34:06.778
So...

34:08.547 --> 34:12.384
the common wisdom that people say
is women aren't funny.

34:12.449 --> 34:15.219
Okay, great.
I can't do anything about that.

34:15.286 --> 34:18.389
If you don't think I'm funny,
check out other women, right?

34:18.822 --> 34:20.592
"Women" is not a type of comedy.

34:20.824 --> 34:22.393
"Women" is a type of person.

34:23.261 --> 34:25.664
I think women are people, I'm not sure.
Anyway, but...

34:26.398 --> 34:29.734
Let's take apart why it's so difficult
to talk about a period.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.304
I think sometimes people just don't know
what a period is.

34:33.371 --> 34:36.206
And so, a man doesn't wanna hear about it
because he's like:

34:36.274 --> 34:38.208
"I feel stupid. I don't know what it is."

34:38.275 --> 34:40.645
And no problem.
They didn't explain it to us either.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.183
I turned 11, mother said,
"You're gonna get your period."

34:45.250 --> 34:47.185
"What's that?"
"A thing you're gonna get."

34:47.252 --> 34:50.322
"When?" "Anytime between now
and the next seven years." "Oh, God."

34:50.388 --> 34:53.592
And then you're just walking to school
like, "Gonna get my period.

34:53.658 --> 34:56.728
What's my period? Comes out of here.
Do I have it? Can anyone see?"

34:56.795 --> 34:58.597
And so, it's... It's...

35:00.465 --> 35:02.767
Here's what a period is.
Let's start with education

35:02.834 --> 35:06.237
and get to the fun story
about hypochondria and my period, right?

35:06.304 --> 35:08.840
Here we go. In case anyone
doesn't know what a period is,

35:09.274 --> 35:13.545
every month a woman sheds the interior
of her uterine lining

35:13.612 --> 35:16.681
because she's not pregnant,
because she's a dirty, dirty whore...

35:18.316 --> 35:21.186
who didn't do the one thing
God put her on earth to do,

35:21.519 --> 35:22.754
which is make a baby.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.123
And that's her three-
to-five-day punishment.

35:25.190 --> 35:27.692
So... that's what a period is.

35:27.759 --> 35:28.759
Now...

35:31.363 --> 35:33.298
I think men can handle that fact, right?

35:33.365 --> 35:34.599
[clears throat]

35:35.700 --> 35:37.669
And I'm not making fun of men. I mean, I...

35:38.236 --> 35:42.641
The thing... Men aren't ever mean to us
about our periods when we talk about them.

35:42.707 --> 35:45.377
They're never mean to us.
They just don't wanna hear it.

35:46.344 --> 35:48.847
And I understand that
because the world caters to you

35:48.913 --> 35:52.217
and you don't have to hear about anything
that you don't know about.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.920
And that must be really scary
when you have to, so, we must...

35:56.621 --> 35:58.223
We must be kind to men.

35:58.623 --> 36:01.393
[audience cheering]

36:01.459 --> 36:04.462
I don't like the old hacky thing of,
"If men had their periods,

36:04.529 --> 36:07.932
they'd be like, 'Yeah, blood everywhere.
Gonna name a bar after it. Yeah... '"

36:08.199 --> 36:09.199
You know.

36:10.735 --> 36:14.239
Maybe that'd be true, maybe it wouldn't.
But I don't know if it'd be true

36:14.305 --> 36:16.608
because if men
were the ones getting their periods,

36:17.175 --> 36:19.811
then women would be the ones
not getting their periods.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.847
And so, it would be unequal.
And I know what I'm like

36:23.181 --> 36:26.184
when I don't understand things
in a man's body. Know what I mean?

36:26.251 --> 36:29.287
Like, "Why do you have balls?"
"'Cause I have them." "Get rid of it."

36:29.354 --> 36:31.890
Like, I'm not necessarily nice.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.761
And so, I wonder what I would be like
if I had a boyfriend who got his period

36:36.828 --> 36:39.297
because men get the periods
and I've never had one.

36:39.431 --> 36:42.934
If I'm at dinner... and my boyfriend
comes out of the bathroom and he's like:

36:43.201 --> 36:45.470
"Uh, Jen... we gotta go."

36:47.238 --> 36:49.307
"Jonathan, we didn't order
an appetizer yet."

36:49.374 --> 36:53.712
"Jen, I just got my period a day early
and I'm wearing white pants.

36:53.778 --> 36:54.946
We gotta go. We gotta go."

36:55.680 --> 36:57.916
"Uh, what do you mean
you got your period a day early?

36:57.982 --> 37:01.586
Doesn't it come on the same day
every month? "" No, it's a hormonal thing,

37:01.653 --> 37:03.388
it's irregular. I can't control it."

37:03.455 --> 37:05.256
"Oh, I can't control my body.

37:05.323 --> 37:06.958
Oh, it's hormones made me do it.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.493
Come on, you can control it."

37:10.395 --> 37:12.731
"Jen, I can't."
"They have tampons in the bathroom?"

37:12.797 --> 37:14.799
"No, they're out and I... So, we gotta go."

37:15.867 --> 37:17.902
"You have a tampon in your purse,
Jonathan?"

37:21.406 --> 37:22.440
"No, I forgot."

37:22.574 --> 37:25.310
"Jonathan, how many times have I told you
be a fucking man

37:25.376 --> 37:29.414
and keep a tampon in your purse
in case... you get your period early.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.816
And why wear white pants
anywhere near the week

37:31.883 --> 37:33.418
of your expected period?

37:33.485 --> 37:36.588
God, what...? How long
have you been getting this, 20 years now?

37:37.889 --> 37:41.760
Why can't you do this, Jonathan?
You can leave. I'm eating here.

37:41.826 --> 37:44.696
We've had this reservation for two weeks.
Leave, I'm staying.

37:45.363 --> 37:49.801
Go. Tie your jacket around your waist,
Jonathan. Everyone can see your period."

37:54.439 --> 37:56.674
Then I call my friend,
"I'm at a restaurant alone.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.643
Yeah. But Jonathan got his period.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.512
No, of course he didn't.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.381
He didn't know it was coming, no.
He never knows.

38:04.349 --> 38:06.451
Oh, like Jonathan had a tampon.
Are you crazy?

38:06.518 --> 38:09.888
We're talking about Jonathan. He's the...
I don't know if I can be with him

38:09.954 --> 38:14.325
'cause if he can't plan for himself, then,
like, how can he plan for me, you know?"

38:15.960 --> 38:18.897
So, that might be what women are like
if men got their periods.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.365
Here's what happened to me.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.636
Now, my period comes
on the same day every month.

38:24.702 --> 38:27.705
Never been early, never been late.
I don't get cramps. Thank you.

38:27.906 --> 38:28.906
So...

38:31.376 --> 38:34.913
One morning...
when I was 41 and a half years old

38:34.979 --> 38:37.982
and really feeling it...
just thinking about it,

38:38.449 --> 38:40.451
God... almost 50.

38:40.752 --> 38:44.355
I mean, not really,
but... closer than I was when I was 13.

38:44.923 --> 38:45.923
Right?

38:46.825 --> 38:49.494
I woke up in the morning
and I went to the ladies' room.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.830
There's not a ladies' room in my house.

38:51.896 --> 38:56.734
It's not like ladies, men, wheelchair,
you know, it's... I went... I was going pee.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.506
And I looked at my underwear
and there were some fresh drops of blood.

39:02.073 --> 39:05.877
Now, again... it was two weeks
from when I was supposed to get my period.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.546
And this
was not uterine lining-looking blood.

39:09.814 --> 39:13.551
This was prick-your-finger fresh blood.
It actually looked like the blood...

39:14.519 --> 39:17.021
that my roommate's cat had
years and years ago.

39:18.656 --> 39:21.693
When I was just a young thing
with a roommate in Brooklyn

39:21.759 --> 39:22.861
and she had a dying cat.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.130
And the cat dragged its body
across the floor

39:26.397 --> 39:29.968
as little drops of blood came out
because the cat's kidneys were failing.

39:31.002 --> 39:33.805
That's right. And my roommate
had to put the cat in a cage

39:33.938 --> 39:35.607
and the cat got put down that day,

39:35.840 --> 39:38.743
the same day that the blood drops
appeared in the morning.

39:39.477 --> 39:43.882
And I looked at myself and I went,
"Today is the day I will be put down.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.020
I don't have a human-sized cage
and I live alone.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.790
I knew if I didn't start a family
this would happen,

39:52.857 --> 39:55.593
but I'll have to put myself down.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.029
I will call the vet
and I will make an appointment."

39:59.163 --> 40:01.032
Because I knew that's internal bleeding.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.701
My kidneys are failing.
I have internal bleeding.

40:03.768 --> 40:06.638
But before I freaked out,
I checked my vagina for glass.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.506
And so I just wanted to make sure...

40:10.675 --> 40:13.778
Because I take sleeping pills sometimes,
you can sleepwalk on those.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.447
I wanted to make sure
that in the middle of the night

40:16.514 --> 40:18.917
I didn't start sleepwalking,
then get into a bar fight,

40:18.983 --> 40:22.053
break a bottle, and then put it in me
and you go, "Come at me!"

40:22.120 --> 40:23.120
So...

40:23.922 --> 40:27.125
I called friends, I'm like,
"Did I get in a bar fight with my vagina?"

40:27.191 --> 40:29.794
They're like, "I don't think so."
I was like, "Thanks.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.132
The bad news is then
I must be put down today.

40:34.832 --> 40:37.702
It's internal bleeding.
I'm gonna call my doctor."

40:37.802 --> 40:41.039
So, I called. I said, "I have to come in.
I have internal bleeding."

40:41.673 --> 40:44.208
I get there, she puts me in the stirrups,
which is stupid.

40:44.475 --> 40:48.046
I'm like, "This isn't a period thing.
Do an x-ray. I have internal bleeding.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.682
My kidneys are failing. Rapidly. Come on."

40:51.082 --> 40:53.518
She looks up and goes,
"Jen, this is your period."

40:53.584 --> 40:56.054
I go, "No, it isn't."
And she goes, "Yes, it is."

40:56.120 --> 40:59.657
"It's not supposed to be here for
two weeks." She goes, "Two weeks early."

40:59.724 --> 41:02.760
I go, "Well, I want a second opinion."

41:02.827 --> 41:05.129
She goes,
"What do you want a second opinion about?"

41:05.563 --> 41:07.799
I said,
"I still think this is internal bleeding."

41:07.865 --> 41:10.535
And she said, "It's not."
And I said, "How do you know?"

41:10.735 --> 41:13.871
And she said, "Because you're seeing
the blood externally."

41:15.540 --> 41:18.509
"Oh, that's such a fucking amazing point.

41:18.576 --> 41:20.078
I never thought about that.

41:20.878 --> 41:23.014
That's why people die
from internal bleeding,

41:23.081 --> 41:24.983
because they don't see the blood.

41:25.049 --> 41:26.818
Okay, I got it.

41:26.884 --> 41:28.653
Good. All right. I am stupid."

41:29.654 --> 41:31.231
She looked at me and went, "Are you okay?"

41:31.255 --> 41:33.891
And I went,
"I don't think so. No, I don't..."

41:34.592 --> 41:38.863
And like a child being handed a toothbrush
by a dentist, she just handed me a tampon

41:38.930 --> 41:40.832
and was like, "Get out of here."
And, um...

41:42.600 --> 41:47.238
Now, the worst part is, I have
a subscription for tampons on Amazon.

41:48.039 --> 41:53.077
And I keep forgetting to cancel it,
and so every month, I get so many tampons.

41:53.144 --> 41:56.614
And I have a closet filled with them.
They will outlive me.

41:57.048 --> 42:00.918
I will not... I will be in menopause
before them. I'll be dead.

42:00.985 --> 42:03.955
I will one day be in a chair,
no blood left in my body, like:

42:04.022 --> 42:06.991
"I haven't even seen blood on a tooth,
let alone this."

42:07.725 --> 42:09.794
I have no kids,
I have no one to give them to.

42:09.861 --> 42:13.297
I'm the weird lady at Halloween every year
where it's like, "Trick or treat."

42:13.564 --> 42:16.134
And I'm like, "You'll be a woman someday.
Yes, take this."

42:16.734 --> 42:20.638
Even you, little boy, you never know.
Take it, take it. Take it, everybody."

42:22.306 --> 42:26.110
It's amazing what we don't know about
our bodies, we don't think about things.

42:26.177 --> 42:29.280
Like, I was taught nothing
about my body growing up.

42:29.547 --> 42:33.184
I didn't lose my virginity until I was
basically almost 22 years old,

42:33.251 --> 42:37.221
which I have a lot of shame about.
I think it's kind of old, kind of dorky.

42:37.321 --> 42:41.225
And even the person I lost my virginity to
does not know that he took it,

42:41.292 --> 42:46.030
'cause I had to lie that I lost it
at age 16 under a creeping willow tree.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.699
You get real detailed
when you lied about stuff, right?

42:50.001 --> 42:54.705
I lost my virginity at age 21, but, like,
almost 22, like, 21 and 11 months.

42:55.306 --> 42:58.709
And it wasn't 'cause I was a prude.
I wanted to lose my virginity.

42:58.776 --> 43:01.913
It had always been my life's goal
ever since I was a little girl.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.849
Just grow up someday
and lose my virginity.

43:05.616 --> 43:08.086
And the thing that stopped me...
It was a Catholic thing.

43:08.152 --> 43:11.889
Well, first of all, I didn't really
understand even what sex was, right?

43:11.956 --> 43:13.925
I mean, I had sex education,
as we all did.

43:13.991 --> 43:17.628
They didn't, like, teach you how to fuck,
it was just like...

43:18.863 --> 43:22.633
They never said anything about, like,
making love and sensuality, and...

43:22.800 --> 43:24.268
There's never gay people involved.

43:24.335 --> 43:27.071
It was just a man lays next to a woman,
they get pregnant.

43:27.138 --> 43:29.340
I was like, "Why would anyone do that?"
And so...

43:30.174 --> 43:32.176
Single bed for life, right? And so...

43:33.211 --> 43:37.281
All we had in sex education for the girls,
we had a big poster of fallopian tubes.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.350
And I was like, "Those are inside of me?"

43:39.684 --> 43:43.621
They looked giant, like, "Why aren't they
coming out my mouth?" It was just like...

43:46.190 --> 43:49.794
And there was just a vagina right there
with an egg right here.

43:49.861 --> 43:51.729
Looked like a ball in a catcher's mitt.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.699
It looked like the egg is always there,
like, "Let's play ball.

43:54.765 --> 43:57.034
Impregnate me.
Come on, we'll go around the bases."

43:57.101 --> 44:02.406
And then for the boys,
they just had a poster of sperm.

44:03.274 --> 44:04.308
And they taught us

44:04.375 --> 44:09.247
in one little drop of semen
there's billions and billions of sperm.

44:10.915 --> 44:12.783
I was like, "Okay."
That's all I remembered.

44:12.850 --> 44:14.986
As I got to be a teenager,
my mother was like:

44:15.119 --> 44:17.421
"Never have sex,
you'll get pregnant every time."

44:17.788 --> 44:21.859
And I was like, but I think she's right
'cause I thought back to those two signs,

44:22.059 --> 44:26.297
the egg waiting and ready
and then billions and billions of sperm.

44:26.364 --> 44:30.134
What are the odds? A billion to one.
You're going to have a baby, right?

44:30.201 --> 44:33.237
I was like, "How come women just have one?
How come they're aren't like:"

44:33.304 --> 44:34.372
[exhaling rapidly]

44:34.438 --> 44:37.308
Like, why aren't babies
just, like, spilling out of everybody?

44:37.375 --> 44:40.912
Like, there's billions and billions
of sperm and one egg.

44:42.079 --> 44:45.883
So, I didn't wanna... I didn't wanna,
you know, lose my virginity so fast.

44:45.950 --> 44:49.020
It was the Catholic Church's fault.
Like, now, I'm cool with Jesus.

44:49.086 --> 44:52.990
I knew Jesus didn't mind if I had sex
'cause Jesus loved whores, right?

44:53.424 --> 44:54.292
It's in the Bible.

44:54.358 --> 44:57.161
He hung out with prostitutes,
they were his favorite people.

44:57.228 --> 45:00.231
When he was fed up with the apostles,
"Where are my prostitutes?"

45:00.298 --> 45:01.198
"We're here."

45:01.265 --> 45:04.201
He'd be like, "We're not gonna write
about you in the Bible."

45:04.268 --> 45:05.937
And then he was friends with them.

45:06.003 --> 45:09.440
So, I knew that once I had sex,
I would just confess to Jesus,

45:09.707 --> 45:13.044
"I had sex." He'd be like, "I love that."
I'd be like, "Just telling you."

45:13.110 --> 45:15.046
- And so that would be fine.
- [audience laughs]

45:16.047 --> 45:17.982
What I was afraid of
was getting pregnant.

45:18.049 --> 45:21.452
Obviously, I didn't want
to be a teenage mother or a mother period.

45:21.719 --> 45:24.288
I knew if I got pregnant,
I would have to have an abortion

45:24.355 --> 45:27.858
and I was very afraid of abortion
because of church.

45:27.925 --> 45:30.461
Not 'cause of Jesus,
but because of the priest at church.

45:30.728 --> 45:34.231
Every single sermon the priest
at my church did were about abortion.

45:34.298 --> 45:36.901
Even though it was not in the Bible
that day, you know.

45:36.968 --> 45:39.136
They would be like,
"Merry Christmas, everybody.

45:39.236 --> 45:41.505
And we are here 'cause Mary had a baby.

45:41.772 --> 45:44.875
She kept it even though she didn't know
who the fuck gave it to her.

45:44.942 --> 45:47.244
And we will celebrate Mary.

45:47.311 --> 45:48.512
She didn't have an abortion

45:48.779 --> 45:51.482
like you girls who go to the clubs
and use it as birth control.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.851
Then if you had an abortion,
you go to hell.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.854
If you know someone
that's had an abortion, you go to hell.

45:56.921 --> 45:59.991
Guys, don't worry. We'll high-five you.
You got a woman pregnant.

46:00.057 --> 46:01.926
But the women are going to hell."

46:01.993 --> 46:04.161
And I was like,
"I don't wanna go to hell."

46:04.261 --> 46:06.130
I decided I'm never gonna get pregnant

46:06.197 --> 46:08.499
and the easiest way to do that
is to never have sex.

46:08.766 --> 46:11.302
And I really didn't understand
what an abortion was.

46:11.369 --> 46:14.205
I didn't know
it was a safe medical procedure

46:14.271 --> 46:17.308
that prevents a pregnancy
from becoming a pregnancy.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.510
I thought you carried a baby to full term

46:19.777 --> 46:22.780
and then in a doctor's office,
they, like, shot it in the head.

46:22.847 --> 46:24.915
You know, I was like,
"I'm not doing that."

46:24.982 --> 46:27.218
[audience laughing]

46:27.885 --> 46:29.553
I'm not judging, but I'm not doing that.

46:29.820 --> 46:31.389
[audience laughs]

46:33.357 --> 46:35.559
So, instead of sex...

46:36.961 --> 46:39.964
Instead of sex,
I was the girl who loved being fingered.

46:40.031 --> 46:42.133
I loved fingering. Loved?

46:42.199 --> 46:44.235
I still love it. I love fingering.

46:44.902 --> 46:48.172
I am bringing back fingering.
It's amazing. Do it to everybody.

46:48.239 --> 46:51.809
It's not just for... It's not just
for kids. It's like sugar cereal.

46:51.876 --> 46:53.878
Adults can enjoy it, too. It's wonderful.

46:54.311 --> 46:57.148
You're going right to the source.
Greatest feeling on Earth.

46:57.214 --> 47:01.185
And so... I had a lovely boyfriend
who used to finger me.

47:01.252 --> 47:03.587
And the first time I ever got fingered...
Oh, my God.

47:05.222 --> 47:06.824
I mean, I touched myself before,

47:06.891 --> 47:09.894
but when you get to go hands free,
it's like, "Whee!" It's so exciting.

47:11.128 --> 47:14.131
And the feeling was so powerful
that after I got fingered,

47:14.198 --> 47:17.068
every moment after that
that I wasn't getting fingered,

47:17.134 --> 47:20.271
I was in a deep, dark depression.

47:20.337 --> 47:21.372
[audience laughs]

47:21.439 --> 47:23.841
That's why when you see
Goth girls walking around,

47:23.908 --> 47:26.377
they're not trying to get attention,
they're upset.

47:26.444 --> 47:29.947
They got fingered once
and haven't been fingered since.

47:30.014 --> 47:33.451
They're like, "It's so dark. Everything
is horrible. I don't feel anything."

47:33.517 --> 47:34.852
So, anyway...

47:36.187 --> 47:39.090
My boyfriend usually went first on me
'cause he was a good guy.

47:39.156 --> 47:41.292
But this one time
I wanted to return the favor.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.260
And so I took my two dry hands,

47:43.327 --> 47:48.065
and I rubbed his penis up and down
like you do, and it almost caught on fire.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.267
- And...
- [audience laughs]

47:52.002 --> 47:55.005
So, like a skilled firefighter,
he grabbed it like a hose

47:55.072 --> 47:58.142
- and was like, "I got this," you know.
- [audience laughs]

47:58.209 --> 48:01.045
And he came on his hand
like a young man of 17 does,

48:01.112 --> 48:03.013
wiped it on his T-shirt in the basement

48:03.080 --> 48:06.050
and then he kindly went in
to return the favor.

48:06.117 --> 48:07.284
All I saw on that finger...

48:07.351 --> 48:09.420
I couldn't see it,
but I knew it was there.

48:09.587 --> 48:11.589
Billions and billions of sperm.

48:12.590 --> 48:13.624
I didn't wanna be like:

48:13.891 --> 48:16.103
"Can you wash your hands?
I'm not ready to become a mother."

48:16.127 --> 48:17.661
'Cause that's dorky, right?

48:17.928 --> 48:20.397
Then I was like,
"You can't get pregnant from fingering.

48:20.464 --> 48:23.300
They would've told us.
They would've told us that in school.

48:23.934 --> 48:27.371
Unless they don't know what this is,
and we just invented it."

48:27.438 --> 48:28.572
[audience laughs]

48:29.373 --> 48:31.585
I was like, "I need that good feeling,"
so I let it happen.

48:31.609 --> 48:33.177
No consequences. I didn't care.

48:33.911 --> 48:36.947
I woke up in the middle of the night
and put my hand on my stomach

48:37.014 --> 48:39.550
- and I felt a heartbeat and I was like:
- [audience laughs]

48:39.617 --> 48:42.286
"Oh, my God. I'm a mother."

48:42.586 --> 48:44.121
[audience laughs]

48:44.622 --> 48:46.023
I was so dumb.

48:46.323 --> 48:50.227
I didn't know that you could feel a pulse
anywhere else but your wrist.

48:50.294 --> 48:53.931
That was the first time I had noticed
a pulse anywhere else in my body.

48:53.998 --> 48:56.066
And I thought I'd grown a baby
in four hours.

48:56.133 --> 48:57.635
I was like, "Whoo! That happens fast.

48:58.235 --> 49:00.271
No wonder this abortion
is such a hot topic.

49:00.337 --> 49:01.972
[audience laughs]

49:02.039 --> 49:04.108
There is a living, breathing person
in there."

49:04.642 --> 49:06.677
Well, I couldn't tell my mom.
She'd kill me.

49:06.977 --> 49:08.579
I didn't have the Internet back then,

49:08.646 --> 49:11.982
not just 'cause my mom wouldn't let me,
it wasn't invented yet, okay?

49:12.049 --> 49:15.085
So, all I had was a typewriter,
and you can't ask your typewriter:

49:15.152 --> 49:18.088
"Can I get fingered,
and then get pregnant from that?"

49:19.089 --> 49:22.459
'Cause your typewriter just has a piece
of paper looking back at you, like:

49:22.593 --> 49:25.362
"I don't know if you can get pregnant.
I'm a typewriter."

49:25.429 --> 49:28.165
So, you're just stuck.
It's a standstill, right?

49:28.365 --> 49:31.035
So, I had to go... to the library.

49:31.702 --> 49:33.204
[audience laughs]

49:33.270 --> 49:36.373
And I couldn't ask the librarian
because she was a friend of my mom.

49:36.440 --> 49:40.244
I couldn't be like, "I got finger-blasted.
What do you think, baby or no?"

49:43.080 --> 49:45.583
So, I had to take a walk
to the card catalog.

49:47.251 --> 49:49.253
Which if you're younger
and you don't know,

49:49.320 --> 49:51.989
it's what we had before the Internet
at the library.

49:52.056 --> 49:54.024
It's a catalog filled with cards.

49:55.092 --> 49:58.529
And in it are cards that have the name
of every book in the library.

49:58.629 --> 50:01.232
Now, as years go by
and more information is out there,

50:01.298 --> 50:03.767
they keep jamming more cards
in the catalog.

50:04.034 --> 50:07.171
They don't get extra catalogs, no, no.
Just shove it in the one.

50:07.238 --> 50:09.073
You put your finger in and take a risk.

50:09.139 --> 50:11.075
You might not get your finger back.
Like, "Aah!"

50:11.141 --> 50:14.445
And so I had to look
for books about pregnancy.

50:14.511 --> 50:18.349
Now, again, the card catalog
is not in alphabetical order. No, no, no.

50:18.415 --> 50:21.018
It is in something
called the Dewey Decimal System,

50:21.185 --> 50:23.187
which is a complicated series of numbers

50:23.254 --> 50:25.589
that librarians have to go to college
to learn.

50:26.156 --> 50:29.293
But they throw it in the lobby at us,
like, "You'll figure it out."

50:29.727 --> 50:33.330
And so... I find books on pregnancy

50:33.397 --> 50:36.700
and, you know, of course, it doesn't
just say pregnancy and then aisle P.

50:36.767 --> 50:39.069
No, I have to memorize, like, 12 numbers.

50:39.136 --> 50:42.239
And so, back then we used to be smart.
We could memorize 12 numbers.

50:42.306 --> 50:44.108
We didn't have to take a picture
or anything.

50:44.174 --> 50:45.609
- And so...
- [audience laughs]

50:45.676 --> 50:49.813
Then I walked all the way back...
to the shelves.

50:50.080 --> 50:53.150
I didn't give an example of the 12-number
thing 'cause I'm too stupid now.

50:53.217 --> 50:57.321
There was no book <i>What to Expect If You're</i>
<i>Expecting 'Cause You've Been Fingered,</i>

50:57.388 --> 50:58.522
so I was like, "Argh!"

50:58.589 --> 51:00.124
[audience laughs]

51:00.190 --> 51:02.593
So, I just didn't do anything.
If I had been pregnant,

51:02.660 --> 51:05.829
it would've been like those TV shows
where I just have it in a toilet.

51:06.096 --> 51:06.797
[audience laughs]

51:07.064 --> 51:10.801
But nine months later, when no baby came,
I was like, "I must have miscarried.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.370
So tragic, but so right for me, you know."

51:13.437 --> 51:15.205
[audience laughing]

51:16.573 --> 51:18.842
So, then I found out.
I found out all the facts.

51:19.109 --> 51:21.321
The egg's not sitting there,
it only comes once in a while.

51:21.345 --> 51:23.647
And if you use condoms
it's 99.9 percent effective.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.749
I was like,
"I gotta lose my virginity then."

51:25.816 --> 51:29.286
But my boyfriend and I had broken up
and I was about to go to college,

51:29.353 --> 51:31.622
I was like, "How am I gonna
lose my virginity now?

51:31.722 --> 51:35.626
I don't know anyone at college yet. What,
am I gonna walk in and go to a guy and go,

51:35.693 --> 51:39.163
"Wanna have sex?" They have to be in love
before they do that.

51:39.229 --> 51:41.131
[audience laughing]

51:41.565 --> 51:42.700
I didn't know anything.

51:45.803 --> 51:48.272
And then I thought,
"Wait, how am I gonna get a guy

51:48.339 --> 51:50.841
to be interested in me
unless he thinks I'm experienced?

51:51.108 --> 51:52.588
No guy wants to sleep with a virgin."

51:52.643 --> 51:54.445
- [woman laughs loudly]
- [audience laughs]

51:54.511 --> 51:55.679
I didn't know that either.

51:57.648 --> 51:59.483
So, I spread a rumor about myself.

51:59.550 --> 52:01.485
[audience laughs]

52:02.553 --> 52:07.324
I told everyone that at age 18,
entering college in 1992,

52:07.391 --> 52:09.226
that I had already fucked ten guys.

52:09.293 --> 52:11.829
That's a lot, ten guys.
I mean, not now, but then.

52:11.895 --> 52:14.231
That was a lot. Ten guys at 18 was a lot.

52:14.298 --> 52:16.800
Some people don't have ten people
in their town. Ten guys.

52:16.867 --> 52:18.235
[audience laughs]

52:18.302 --> 52:20.371
And 1992 was an innocent, innocent time.

52:20.671 --> 52:22.673
<i>Beverly Hills, 90210,</i> Brenda and Dylan,

52:22.740 --> 52:25.442
they waited a year
to lose their virginity to each other.

52:25.509 --> 52:28.445
Dylan was an alcoholic
who lived by himself. He was a virgin.

52:28.512 --> 52:30.147
It was an innocent time.

52:30.214 --> 52:31.482
[audience laughs]

52:33.517 --> 52:36.754
So, no guys wanted to have sex with me
because they thought I had an STD

52:36.820 --> 52:38.222
because I'd fucked ten guys.

52:38.889 --> 52:41.925
And so, I went year after year after year
not getting laid

52:42.292 --> 52:45.396
until I met someone who transferred
into my college my senior year

52:45.462 --> 52:47.798
and he hadn't heard the rumors
and I didn't tell him.

52:47.865 --> 52:50.934
We had sex, it was fun, it was fine.
I don't remember every detail

52:51.201 --> 52:54.371
'cause it was long ago, but it was lovely.
And I walked home that day,

52:54.438 --> 52:57.541
just, you know, listening to my Discman,
listening to Madonna,

52:57.608 --> 53:01.378
you know, <i>Bedtime Stories</i> album. I'm like,
"I get it. I'm sexual, too, Madge."

53:01.445 --> 53:03.347
- And, um...
- [audience laughs]

53:03.414 --> 53:05.649
But something stopped me dead
as I was walking

53:05.716 --> 53:08.519
and I was like,
"Wait a minute, my hymen didn't break."

53:09.353 --> 53:12.890
That's another thing they teach us girls.
We have a hymen. It's a piece of skin

53:13.190 --> 53:15.492
that's somewhere in our vagina
and a penis pokes it

53:15.559 --> 53:18.829
and we bleed and get sheets dirty
and we suck, fuck you, you're dumped.

53:18.896 --> 53:20.898
- So, now...
- [audience laughs]

53:22.366 --> 53:24.468
my hymen didn't break
and I was like, "Uh-oh.

53:25.302 --> 53:27.671
I hope my hymen didn't get pushed up
into my body

53:27.738 --> 53:30.374
and now it's strangling,
you know, my internal organs."

53:30.441 --> 53:32.209
[audience laughs]

53:32.276 --> 53:35.446
I don't even know what a hymen is.
How strong is it? How does it work?

53:36.280 --> 53:38.215
And I was like, "I gotta go to a doctor."

53:38.715 --> 53:41.585
And so, I went to the school nurse,
but I didn't wanna act

53:41.652 --> 53:44.521
like I just lost my virginity,
so, I tried to play it all "cas."

53:44.988 --> 53:47.391
I walked in, I was like,
"Hey, quick question.

53:47.758 --> 53:49.760
- Um...
- [audience laughs]

53:52.362 --> 53:55.799
When I lost my virginity,
whenever that was...

53:55.866 --> 53:57.000
- uh...
- [audience laughs]

53:57.634 --> 53:59.703
my hymen didn't break.
What's up with that?"

53:59.770 --> 54:01.705
[audience laughs]

54:01.772 --> 54:03.807
She was like,
"That's an old wive's tale.

54:03.874 --> 54:05.542
It's fine. If you've used a tampon

54:05.609 --> 54:08.545
or ridden a horse or took a dance class
it can stretch, it can break."

54:08.612 --> 54:09.612
I go:

54:10.247 --> 54:14.351
"Okay, it can't get shoved up
and start strangling your organs?"

54:14.418 --> 54:16.653
"No, it's a tissue."
"Can it get wadded up and...?"

54:16.720 --> 54:19.356
- "No, not a tissue. Like, it's a..."
- [audience laughs]

54:19.423 --> 54:20.657
I go, "Oh, okay, okay."

54:22.926 --> 54:25.629
She looks at my chart like,
"About to turn 22." She goes:

54:25.696 --> 54:29.800
"So, you didn't just lose your virginity,
did you?" "No, I fucked like ten guys."

54:30.667 --> 54:32.603
And that's when I got my first STD test.

54:32.870 --> 54:34.738
- So...
- [audience laughs]

54:35.906 --> 54:37.274
So, I'm in a relationship,

54:37.341 --> 54:40.043
and I don't have jokes about it
because it's a nice story.

54:40.310 --> 54:43.514
I'm with someone that I love a lot,
we've known each other for a long time...

54:43.580 --> 54:46.180
And look at you get quiet.
No one likes nice things, I understand.

54:46.316 --> 54:48.385
[audience laughs]

54:48.852 --> 54:51.822
But there was a time in my life
when I was what I call "single" single,

54:51.889 --> 54:54.625
when I was like,
"God, like, no one seems to like me."

54:54.725 --> 54:57.327
I wasn't getting picked
and I didn't like how it felt.

54:57.394 --> 55:00.697
And I read a self-help book that was like,
take yourself on a self date.

55:00.764 --> 55:03.333
And so, I did that.
And I would sit at bars

55:03.400 --> 55:06.603
and... guys would come up and go,
"Can I sit here?" I go, "No.

55:07.504 --> 55:09.373
[audience laughs]

55:09.439 --> 55:11.308
I'm also sitting there, please stop.

55:11.375 --> 55:12.809
[audience laughs]

55:13.410 --> 55:16.480
I'm on a... I'm on a date with myself,
so, would you please?"

55:18.482 --> 55:19.917
I started saying bullshit things,

55:19.983 --> 55:23.854
you know, after reading these books, like,
"You know what? Gonna take some time.

55:23.921 --> 55:27.057
Can't love someone till you love yourself,
you know?" What bullshit.

55:27.324 --> 55:29.326
You can love someone
when you don't love yourself.

55:29.393 --> 55:31.862
- What a fun distraction, right? So...
- [audience laughs]

55:34.031 --> 55:36.667
But my friend did this.
She decided to have a party.

55:36.733 --> 55:40.037
She called it Facebook in Real Life.
And she invited a bunch of people...

55:40.103 --> 55:42.940
[audience laughing]

55:43.006 --> 55:46.109
Really good idea. She invited people
that sort of know each other.

55:46.376 --> 55:48.946
You could vouch for someone
if you don't know them well.

55:49.012 --> 55:52.349
So, you could be like, "Oh, hey,
John's fun. He's a murderer, though.

55:52.416 --> 55:54.651
Don't go home with him,
but fun at parties. Okay."

55:54.751 --> 55:57.487
They're like, "Oh, cool."
I met this guy, really nice guy.

55:57.554 --> 55:58.589
He was age appropriate,

55:58.655 --> 56:00.724
we got each other's numbers,
started texting.

56:00.791 --> 56:03.393
We liked the same things,
talked about the same stuff.

56:03.460 --> 56:05.896
He didn't send a dick pic,
nothing inappropriate.

56:05.963 --> 56:08.865
I felt respected and then, you know,
after a couple of weeks,

56:08.932 --> 56:12.402
he asked me to go have wine with him.
I was like, "We're going on date."

56:12.569 --> 56:15.005
We're sitting there
and drinking and talking.

56:15.072 --> 56:17.507
I'm not getting a vibe
he wants to sleep with me,

56:17.574 --> 56:19.576
but I'm like,
"I'll loosen him up a little."

56:19.643 --> 56:21.778
Waitress comes and she's like,
"Want a third?"

56:21.845 --> 56:26.016
We do that dance you do when you,
"I don't normally drink more than two.

56:26.083 --> 56:29.753
Do you? I don't. I could if you...
I... You will? I'll have one, yeah.

56:29.820 --> 56:31.622
We're gonna fuck.
Yeah, we're gonna fuck.

56:31.688 --> 56:33.657
- Bring a third."
- [audience laughing]

56:34.958 --> 56:36.426
So, she brings the third.

56:36.860 --> 56:39.105
As I'm taking a sip, he's like,
"Anyway, my girlfriend..."

56:39.129 --> 56:40.931
I'm like, "Pfft! Your fucking what?

56:40.998 --> 56:42.966
- What kind of shit is this?"
- [audience laughs]

56:43.033 --> 56:44.067
I don't say that, but...

56:44.935 --> 56:47.904
No, I act interested.
I'm like, "Tell me about your girlfriend?"

56:47.971 --> 56:49.773
- And...
- [audience laughs]

56:50.440 --> 56:53.110
Nothing wrong hanging out with a woman
if you have girlfriend.

56:53.176 --> 56:55.479
Absolutely nothing.
I have tons of male friends.

56:55.545 --> 56:58.582
But that's it, the door is shut.
Thank you, I have male friends.

56:58.649 --> 57:00.651
I don't need any more.
I don't need any more.

57:00.717 --> 57:03.687
I have plenty, right?
I didn't understand what his angle was.

57:03.754 --> 57:06.923
I said, "Does your girlfriend get upset
that you go out with women?"

57:06.990 --> 57:10.093
He goes, "Oh, no, she knows I love women.
I'm a male feminist."

57:10.160 --> 57:12.863
I go, "'I'm a male feminist.'

57:13.430 --> 57:16.633
Thanks so much for being on our side,
male fucking..."

57:16.700 --> 57:19.970
If I wanna fucking drink wine
with a feminist, I'll stay home by myself

57:20.037 --> 57:21.738
and I might even get laid. I...

57:21.805 --> 57:23.040
[audience laughing]

57:23.106 --> 57:26.176
And my fingers do not have billions
and billions of sperm.

57:27.978 --> 57:30.948
I started to figure it out, like,
"I see how life is different.

57:31.014 --> 57:34.518
I see how it's different." Back in the
day, men would marry the woman

57:34.584 --> 57:36.453
that cooks and cleans and has the babies

57:36.520 --> 57:38.655
and he starts to look at her
more like a mother.

57:38.722 --> 57:41.191
So, he needs to get sex on the side.
Now, men are smart.

57:41.458 --> 57:44.061
They live with the sex
and they want the brains on the side.

57:44.127 --> 57:47.798
Well, me and all the other women
are not gonna be your mind whores, dude,

57:47.864 --> 57:48.732
all right?

57:48.865 --> 57:51.768
You're not gonna finger her
then come out, have a drink with me

57:51.835 --> 57:54.871
and talk about documentaries
until midnight, you pig!

57:54.938 --> 57:56.840
[audience laughing]

57:56.907 --> 57:58.217
- Thank you.
- [audience applauds]

57:58.241 --> 58:02.679
So... we're not friends anymore,
but I really...

58:02.746 --> 58:04.147
[audience laughs]

58:04.214 --> 58:07.184
I know it sounds like I hate men.
I really don't. I love men

58:07.250 --> 58:09.586
and I look at them
the way I look at children,

58:09.653 --> 58:13.023
which is like, "Oh, my God, for people
who don't know what you're doing,

58:13.090 --> 58:15.125
you have so much energy about it,
you know."

58:15.192 --> 58:19.129
- [audience laughing]
- But... the... The one...

58:21.631 --> 58:24.968
The one area that is really cool,
I like that people say they're feminist,

58:25.035 --> 58:28.905
and it's like, you know, white people can
say they identify for Black Lives Matter,

58:28.972 --> 58:30.607
and men can say they're feminist.

58:30.674 --> 58:34.711
It's really cool. There's one area, though
that I don't know why we can't nip this,

58:34.778 --> 58:37.814
it would be so quick and easy to do,
is street harassment.

58:37.881 --> 58:41.118
It is still a thing
that we are shouting at some men

58:41.218 --> 58:45.022
to understand, you know,
that it is a really serious scary thing.

58:45.088 --> 58:49.559
And I feel like if you're going to yell
out of your car at a woman, commit to it.

58:49.626 --> 58:52.829
Get an old-timey car with a horn
that's like, "Aooga!"

58:52.896 --> 58:53.930
[audience laughs]

58:53.997 --> 58:55.532
It's so stupid.

58:56.733 --> 59:01.271
So, you know, mo... All of my guy friends
are not idiots, they do not act this way,

59:01.538 --> 59:04.141
but I found out one of my friends
who I respect does this.

59:04.307 --> 59:07.778
I'm like, "You street harass?"
"It's not harassment, it's a compliment."

59:07.844 --> 59:11.014
And I go, "What kind of things do you do?"
"I've yelled, 'Nice tits.'"

59:11.081 --> 59:13.116
"You yell 'Nice tits' at a woman?"

59:13.183 --> 59:14.584
He goes, "Her tits were nice."

59:14.651 --> 59:17.320
"I understand the inspiration behind that,
I'm just...

59:17.587 --> 59:18.588
[audience laughs]

59:18.655 --> 59:21.792
You can't do that to us.
It's... It's... It's scary."

59:21.858 --> 59:24.628
He goes, "What's scary about 'Nice tits'?"
I go, "Well..."

59:25.595 --> 59:28.832
He goes, "It's a compliment."
I go, "I get it. Let me take this apart.

59:28.899 --> 59:35.238
I get on its face that 'nice tits, '
dictionary, technically a compliment, yes.

59:35.305 --> 59:39.810
But we don't know, if we don't respond
the way that you want us to respond,

59:39.876 --> 59:42.746
or if we don't respond at all,
'nice tits' can be followed up

59:42.813 --> 59:45.949
with, 'Fuck you, bitch, '
and then we get scared."

59:46.016 --> 59:47.684
And my friend goes, "Oh, I got it.

59:47.851 --> 59:51.588
What if I just yell 'nice tits'
but don't yell 'fuck you, bitch' after?"

59:51.655 --> 59:53.790
- I'm like, "No, but we don't...
- [audience laughs]

59:53.857 --> 59:56.293
We don't know. We don't know.
'Nice tits... '"

59:56.593 --> 01:00:00.097
Compliments and murder
both start with compliments.

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:02.866
So, we don't know. We don't know.
We don't know

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:04.093
when someone says "nice tits"

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:07.037
if it's just, beep, beep,
"Nice tits, bye," and they drive off,

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.738
or if it's gonna be
like, "Nice tits"

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.216
[mimics brakes]
stop the car and like,

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.076
'"Nice tits. So nice. Gonna chop them up,
put them in a blender.

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:14.945
Then I'm gonna put them in a freezer

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:18.014
and make tits pops. Tits, tits, tits.'"
We don't know.

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:20.183
[audience laughs]

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:24.688
So, my friend goes, "What should I say?"
I go, "Just say nothing. Say no words.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:25.789
Say no words."

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:29.259
He goes, "That's my free speech.
That's free speech. You can't do that."

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:31.361
I go, "It's not...
Whatever free speech means.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.896
But, okay, fine, free speech.

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:37.200
I didn't say you couldn't say 'nice tits, '
I said, please don't yell it to us.

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:40.170
So, maybe if you're driving by a woman
who has nice tits,

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.206
you roll up your window
and smash your face against the glass

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:45.275
and just go, 'Nice tits.'
You could do that.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:46.276
[audience laughs]

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:48.879
Or see a woman with nice tits
and call a friend and go,

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.848
'Nice tits, nice tits, I see nice tits.
Okay. Nice tits.'

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:56.419
Or if you have the time,
veer off the road, go into a field,

01:00:56.686 --> 01:01:01.224
get on your knees and let God know.
'Nice tits!'"

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:04.294
[audience cheering and applauding]

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.937
My friend and I could not come
to any agreement on this.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.206
And so, I was like, "Maybe he's right."

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:20.210
If we just yell, "No, no, no,"
guys just hear their mothers:

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:21.211
[scolds]

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:25.048
So, we can't just say, "Don't say this,
don't..." Maybe there's a middle ground.

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:27.784
Maybe there's something you can say.
I don't know what it is.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.787
But I had an experience recently
that gave me kind of an idea.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:33.957
So, I was in North Carolina
and I was walking by myself.

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:37.794
And I was on the side of the road
and it was dusk.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:40.063
And a white guy in a truck... drove by.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.767
And then he stopped...
and he pulled back...

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:46.303
and he just stared at me out the window.

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.805
And I was like, "Oh, fuck."

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:50.073
[audience laughs]

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.275
Because if you're a woman
or not white or gay

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:55.946
and you're walking alone in the South
and a white guy in a truck pulls up,

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:59.115
you know in 20 minutes
there's gonna be candles and flowers

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:01.484
right where you were standing, right?
That's... Yeah.

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:05.222
Guy rolls down his window and goes,
"Excuse me, ma'am.

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:07.457
You mind if I say something real creepy
to you?"

01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:09.993
[audience laughing]

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.164
And like an idiot,
I walk up to the truck. "Okay."

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:15.999
[audience laughs]

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.769
And then I get mad and I think of...
I take a minute and think of all the women

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:22.872
from real... Real severe street harassment,
acid in the face

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:25.842
to just little infractions
like "nice tits," and I'm like, "No.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:30.113
No, you cannot say something creepy."
I go, "No, you cannot and fuck you."

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.283
I start walking away proud of myself
and realize, "I look crazy."

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:36.219
That's what happens,
is if you're talking to a girl in a bar

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:37.187
and it's going well

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.956
and after a minute she's just like,
"Fuck you!"

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:41.291
"What did I do?" "Nothing."

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:44.094
But we're taught to be polite
and so, we're holding it in.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.429
All we have to say is,
"I don't feel like talking."

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:50.166
But we talk and we're like, "Eat shit!"
And you're very confused. And so...

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:52.369
We have to get better at that.
And so, anyway...

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.172
he goes, "Ma'am, I didn't mean
to scare you. I'm sorry. I..."

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.777
I just wanted to say I love your boots.
That's it, I love your boots.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:03.046
I was wearing big, black platform boots,
he goes:

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.348
"I'm a married man.
I'm not trying to pick you up.

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.918
I've never noticed fashion in my life.
Well, I have one more question."

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:11.121
"Here comes a creepy question."
I go, "What?"

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:14.891
He goes, "Are they comfortable?" "Yeah."
"That's a win-win for you, ain't it?"

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:15.825
I'm like:

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:17.927
[audience laughs]

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:23.233
And he said, "Thank you. Thank you
for letting me give you that compliment.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.140
I couldn't have lived with myself
if I hadn't."

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.436
[audience laughs]

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:29.873
And then he drove off. I was like,
"He couldn't have lived with himself

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:33.343
if he didn't give me that compliment."
That is so dramatic.

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:36.112
And again,
it is hard for men in the world.

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:37.547
We must be kind to them.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.950
And so...
But part of me is evil and I was like:

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:44.254
"God, it would've been great
if I didn't let him compliment me."

01:03:44.454 --> 01:03:48.358
Somehow I got to see the rest of his life
played out, that deep regret, you know.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:51.194
It's just like some kind of play
set in the South

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.396
and he's just at home every night
and he's like:

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:59.836
"I'm not hungry tonight, Martha."
She's like, "Henry, I made your favorite.

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:02.405
Two nights and you haven't eaten it.
You're all bones.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:08.478
"Are you cheating on me, Henry?"
"No, Martha, it's not about sex.

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:12.015
Sometimes things are about... fashion.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.851
[audience laughing]

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:20.190
Son, if you ever get the chance
to compliment a woman and don't take it,

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.325
you might not be able to live
with yourself.

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:24.227
Listen to your daddy."

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:29.466
He's on his death bed, his father is like,
"Son, any more wisdom before you go?"

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:32.402
And he's just like, "Black boots,"
and then he dies.

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:33.470
[audience laughs]

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:36.172
No one knows what he means.
His wife never understood.

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:39.409
"Black boots? I know what that means.
His daddy was in the war.

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:43.279
His daddy wore black boots. He wants
to wear his daddy's boots in his coffin."

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:46.516
And he doesn't. She's shoving
the daddy's boots on his corpse feet.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:49.919
And he's up in heaven, like,
"That's not the black boots I meant.

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:53.123
I like women's shoes.
That's right, Jesus, I like women's shoes.

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.524
I can be myself up here."

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:56.493
- So...
- [audience laughs]

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.927
that's when I started to think.

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:03.233
The compliment, if you must yell at us,
yell about our outfit, not our bodies.

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:06.469
We don't wanna think about the fact
we have a body every five minutes,

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:09.572
and you make us think about it
all the time, and we don't want to.

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:12.509
You know that feeling
when you just have keys and your phone

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:15.478
and you feel so free?
We'd love to feel that way at the bank,

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:18.448
but can't take our tits and vagina
and leave them on the table.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:22.018
So, we've got to take these things
even at 8:30 in the morning.

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:26.055
We're like, "Oh, God, everyone's looking."
And, you know... And if someone is like:

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:29.292
"Nice ass," but we don't feel good,
we're like, "Is that sarcastic?"

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:31.027
It's a whole mind fuck, right?

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.664
But if you just compliment clothes,
we can all get along, right?

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.133
If you wanna street harass us
and you drive by

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.070
and you're like, "Sweetheart.
Hey, honey... that little bow

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:44.474
matches that detail in your shoes.
That is not lost on me, baby.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:45.975
[audience laughs]

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:49.612
I love a good accessory.
I hope you're going to dinner tonight.

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:53.149
Doesn't have to be with a man,
could be by yourself. You seem unafraid.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:56.419
I like that. You're walking
with your job and your freedom.

01:05:56.486 --> 01:05:59.989
And I'm not threatened by that at all.
I don't have to man-splain to you.

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.725
I'm just letting you know
that a plaid and a polka dot

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.403
can sometimes match. You go, toots."

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:05.462
[audience laughs]

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:08.031
Thank you guys so much.
You've been amazing.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:09.165
[audience cheering]

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:10.266
Thanks again.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:13.969
JKL.

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:17.674
[audience cheering]

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:34.523
Jennifer.

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:36.059
- Oh!
- Sweetheart.

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:39.095
- Hi.
- Lovely to see you.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:41.464
- You looked so gorgeous up there.
- Mom. Oh, thank you.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:44.434
- Jennifer, what's all this food?
- Oh, that's part of my rider.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:46.369
- What's a rider?
- It's like, you know,

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:48.571
food they bring backstage.
Part of your budget.

01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:51.207
- You like the show?
- They take this out of your pay?

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:53.710
This is wasteful.
Jennifer, you're not good with money.

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:56.513
It's not my money.
Didn't like the show or anything or...?

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:59.582
Oh, my God. No. Mom, Dad, get out,
we're filming. We're filming. Cut.

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:01.889
- [woman] Jennifer, who is this?
- [Ronald] Filming what?

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:04.587
- This is my real family.
- [director] Still speeding.

01:07:04.654 --> 01:07:07.257
- We can still roll on this?
- [Joan] Why would you do this?

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:10.026
Why would you hire people to play us?
We're here.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.362
Well, that's you. It's already done.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:16.666
She doesn't look like me.
I have blond hair. She has gray hair.

01:07:16.733 --> 01:07:18.301
And I'm not Oriental, Jen.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.237
Oh, my God, Dad, don't...
That's racist. You're...

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:22.304
I'm Japanese.

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:25.308
Oh, Jennifer's best friend at school
was Japanese

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:28.578
and she taught Jennifer
how to say the word "hello."

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.113
[speaks gibberish]

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.191
- [Jen] "<i>Konichiwa."</i>
- [Ronald] <i>Konichiwa.</i>

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.684
But it doesn't matter.
<i>Konichiwa</i> to you.

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:38.655
Listen, these are actors hired
to represent the character

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.690
of Jen Kirkman, right?
That make it better?

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:43.693
What? There's no character
based on your sister, Gail?

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.528
Okay, Gail, I would've put you in it,

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:48.064
but you told me
when I used to have that joke

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:50.466
about how you got caught smoking pot,
you said:

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:54.604
"Don't put me in your act anymore." So,
I do not say anything about you anymore

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:55.671
out of respect.

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:59.842
Jen, you just told that story again...
on camera.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.613
That's what she does,
she talks about everybody.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.248
She called Dad a racist.

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:08.851
- He said, "Oriental."
- [man] Maybe we can take a break.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.621
Yeah. Where's the pizza?
Did you get any pizza?

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.856
No, I didn't get any pizza.
I just did a show.

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.792
And I'm sorry, there's no part for you,

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:18.728
and the reason is not because
I didn't think you'd be good,

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:21.698
but you'd make a scene.
It's happening. You're making a scene.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:24.434
I'm not all comfortable.
I'm really not comfortable.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.337
- You're not comfortable? How do we feel?
- Jen, why do you ruin everything?

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:30.707
- Yeah. Jeez, you know.
- I know a great place, guys.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.408
- You do?
- [woman] We should just leave.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:35.243
- [Joan] Just forget about her.
- [woman] Were you in the audience,

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:37.350
- because I didn't see you out there.
- [Joan] Yeah.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:42.885
Can we use any of that?
Can we use any of that

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:45.455
because my parents
just ruined my Netflix special

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.223
and it was kind of fucking awesome.
