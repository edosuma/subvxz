08:27.132 --> 08:29.092
and let's go.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.261
That is the old

08:29.134 --> 08:31.261
secret hiding place.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.513
I don't keep it

08:31.303 --> 08:33.513
there anymore.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.765
Just turn around

08:33.554 --> 08:35.765
and shut your eyes.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.031
[instrumental music]

08:55.494 --> 08:56.786
Uh, thanks for the ride, Joey.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.621
We'll be done

08:56.828 --> 08:58.621
in about ten minutes.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.874
Okay, I'm gonna go down to the

08:58.663 --> 09:00.874
one-hour photo store and watch

09:00.915 --> 09:03.584
people's vacations

09:00.915 --> 09:03.584
go by. Bye, girls.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.337
(together)

09:03.626 --> 09:05.337
Bye.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.218
Oh, here it is.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.179
Oh, it's so pretty.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.179
It's so perfect.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.597
It's all in one piece.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.597
It's so..

09:17.807 --> 09:19.434
$80?

09:19.476 --> 09:20.894
Hi! May I help you, girls?

09:20.935 --> 09:22.687
Uh, yes.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.690
By any chance, would this

09:22.729 --> 09:25.690
sweater be going on sale soon?

09:25.732 --> 09:27.567
Like in the next ten minutes?

09:27.608 --> 09:29.610
No, I'm sorry.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.197
Well, we only have $43.80.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.781
Plus..

09:35.783 --> 09:38.119
...322 pennies in cash.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.164
I'm sorry,

09:39.204 --> 09:41.164
you're a little short.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.500
I can't help it.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.500
I'm only six.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.921
That's it.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.300
I'm gonna have to tell Joey,

09:49.506 --> 09:52.300
Uncle Jesse and Dad

09:52.342 --> 09:54.719
that I turned their beautiful

09:52.342 --> 09:54.719
Valentine's Day present

09:54.761 --> 09:58.557
into $80 worth

09:54.761 --> 09:58.557
of royal blue dishrags.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.308
That's too bad.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.436
But as long as we're here,

10:00.350 --> 10:02.436
let's try stuff on.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.023
Hmm.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.402
- Excuse me, ma'am.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.402
- Yes?

10:10.444 --> 10:11.778
Is this sign true?

10:11.819 --> 10:14.281
I can buy something now

10:11.819 --> 10:14.281
and pay for it later?

10:14.322 --> 10:16.950
Why, yes. People buy now

10:14.322 --> 10:16.950
and pay later all the time.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.368
It's called credit.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.080
Hear that, Mr. Bear?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.831
I can buy D.J. the sweater now

10:23.873 --> 10:26.918
and when I save up enough money,

10:23.873 --> 10:26.918
I can pay for it later.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.842
Come on, Steph.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.842
Let's go find Joey.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.137
[buzzer beeping]

10:37.178 --> 10:38.221
'Oh, excuse me, ma'am'

10:38.263 --> 10:40.890
I need to look inside your bag.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.267
I hate shoplifters.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.935
They drive up

10:42.309 --> 10:43.935
the prices for everyone.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.442
- Thanks for the ride, Joey.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.442
- You're welcome.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.444
You know, girls, I'm still

10:50.484 --> 10:52.444
amazed the three of you went

10:52.486 --> 10:56.114
into a mall for 20 minutes and

10:52.486 --> 10:56.114
not one of you bought a thing.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.492
We were practicing

10:56.156 --> 10:58.492
our browsing.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.951
You know, Kimmy, one day

10:59.993 --> 11:03.830
you gonna make some

10:59.993 --> 11:03.830
lucky young man very...confused.

11:05.790 --> 11:09.336
Great. How am I gonna tell

11:05.790 --> 11:09.336
everybody about the sweater?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.338
You don't have to.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.424
Ta-da!

11:14.466 --> 11:17.135
Stephanie, how did you pay

11:14.466 --> 11:17.135
for that sweater?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.553
I didn't have to.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.472
The lady said,

11:18.595 --> 11:20.472
I could buy now and pay later.

11:20.514 --> 11:21.889
So I took it for you.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.185
You're welcome.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.523
Oh, Stephanie.

11:29.564 --> 11:30.607
What's wrong?

11:30.649 --> 11:32.108
You ripped it off.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.235
No. I didn't.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.235
It's wrong to steal.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.739
Look, Stephanie, I know

11:35.945 --> 11:38.739
you were trying to help me.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.410
But you took the sweater

11:39.949 --> 11:42.410
without paying.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.995
That's called credit.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.749
Well, if you don't have a credit

11:45.664 --> 11:48.749
card, it's called shop lifting.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.793
It is?

11:51.628 --> 11:52.920
I gotta get out of here.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.633
If the police ever

11:54.255 --> 11:56.633
connect me with this crime

11:56.675 --> 11:59.010
I might be banned

11:56.675 --> 11:59.010
from the mall forever.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.057
I'm a criminal?

12:06.267 --> 12:07.894
I broke the law?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.357
D.J., I'm scared.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.484
I don't wanna go to jail.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.611
[instrumental music]

12:21.115 --> 12:23.535
Am I gonna go to prison?

12:23.577 --> 12:27.372
Steph, don't panic,

12:23.577 --> 12:27.372
you're not gonna go to jail.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.790
Look, all we have to do is

12:27.414 --> 12:29.790
return this sweater tomorrow.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.544
Everything will be just fine.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.544
Just calm down.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.213
I feel much better.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.673
[knock on door]

12:36.715 --> 12:38.633
Let's go valentines.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.633
We've got a date tonight.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.427
Oh, D.J.,

12:38.675 --> 12:40.427
wear your new sweater.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.470
I can't wait to see

12:40.468 --> 12:42.470
how it looks on you.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.474
Now what do we do?

12:46.516 --> 12:48.976
Well, if I wear the stolen

12:46.516 --> 12:48.976
sweater to dinner

12:49.018 --> 12:50.562
and return it tomorrow

12:50.604 --> 12:53.481
at least I won't ruin

12:50.604 --> 12:53.481
everyone's Valentine's Day.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.942
I'd ruin tomorrow instead.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.818
You have such a good heart.

12:59.446 --> 13:03.241
Now, all I have to do is get

12:59.446 --> 13:03.241
this plastic alarm thingy off.

13:06.661 --> 13:07.954
It won't come off.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.707
That's alright.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.292
I think it looks nice.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.962
There's gotta be a way

13:14.335 --> 13:15.962
to hide it.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.465
Come on, girls let's go.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.426
Ahoy, land lubber.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.681
I'm setting sail for me

13:23.511 --> 13:26.681
Valentine costume party.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.891
Does you have any

13:26.723 --> 13:28.891
spinach in a can?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.769
This frozen stuff

13:28.933 --> 13:30.769
shivers me timbers.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.730
A-gah-gah-gah!

13:33.772 --> 13:36.023
I thought you were to go as

13:33.772 --> 13:36.023
a famous romantic couple.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.567
What happened to Cheryl?

13:37.609 --> 13:41.279
Oh, Olive Oyl.

13:37.609 --> 13:41.279
It's your Romeo.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.116
Oh, hi, Popeye.

13:45.158 --> 13:49.579
No, wait, Cheryl. It's more

13:45.158 --> 13:49.579
like, oh, Popeye. My hero.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.499
Oh, Popeye. My hero!

13:53.458 --> 13:55.834
Huh, we'll work on it.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.755
Well, I'll work on my voice

13:55.876 --> 13:58.755
and you work on these muscles.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.175
And she's got a little

14:00.548 --> 14:02.175
smart mouth on her.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.510
You know, it's gonna be..

14:06.304 --> 14:08.306
Alright, now where's

14:06.304 --> 14:08.306
that little Swee'Pea?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.600
Oh, Swee'Pea.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.564
Oh, Michelle, come here.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.484
Oh, that's how you looked

14:16.606 --> 14:19.484
the day you were born.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.696
Oh, gosh, how adorable.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.071
Hi, Popeye.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.116
Here you go.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.454
Danny, I wish you

14:29.202 --> 14:31.454
was comin' with me.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.623
Now that I takes

14:31.496 --> 14:33.623
a good looks at you

14:33.665 --> 14:36.209
you're built more like

14:33.665 --> 14:36.209
Olive Oyl than Cheryl is.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.548
Come on, Olive, let's go

14:38.712 --> 14:41.548
before me forearms explode.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.591
A-gah-gah-gah!

14:43.633 --> 14:45.760
[scatting]

14:49.472 --> 14:51.683
Come on girls let's go.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.895
Danny, your dates are ready.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.398
Girls, why are your sweaters

14:55.936 --> 14:58.398
rolled up on the side?

14:59.315 --> 15:00.692
Uh, it's the latest style.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.151
Pretty cool, huh?

15:02.193 --> 15:03.570
Try it, daddy.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.155
Hey, if anyone's ready

15:03.611 --> 15:06.155
to take a fashion risk

15:06.197 --> 15:07.948
it's your rad dad.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.286
Oh, bless you.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.663
Jesse took me on a hayride

15:13.705 --> 15:15.289
through the streets

15:13.705 --> 15:15.289
of San Francisco.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.583
It was so romantic.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.376
The stars twinkling

15:18.418 --> 15:19.627
the city lights shining,

15:19.669 --> 15:21.045
[sneezing]

15:19.669 --> 15:21.045
Jesse sneezing.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.632
A little allergy to the hay.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.218
Well, we're off

15:24.674 --> 15:27.218
to see "Roger Rabbit."

15:27.260 --> 15:29.804
For the fifth time.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.804
Come on, girls.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.806
- Bye, guys.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.806
- Bye, girls. Have fun.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.016
- You too.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.016
- Danny, what, uh..

15:34.058 --> 15:36.102
What's with the sweater?

15:36.143 --> 15:38.855
It's the latest style, dude.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.566
Yeah. There's a look

15:38.897 --> 15:41.566
I don't wanna know better.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.112
Boy, you really

15:43.276 --> 15:46.112
went all out tonight.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.573
Oh, you ain't seen

15:46.153 --> 15:48.573
nothing yet, kid.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.577
First, a little

15:48.615 --> 15:52.577
language of love.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.037
Some<i> musica.</i>

15:55.079 --> 15:59.500
Next, some fire to heat up

15:55.079 --> 15:59.500
the evening a little.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.085
As if we needed it.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.005
- Oh.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.005
- Ooh.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.550
And now, a little toast.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.929
Here we are.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.598
To my valentine.

16:20.438 --> 16:21.731
To finding each other.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.024
Happy Valentine's Day.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.656
Becky, I have a little

16:27.946 --> 16:29.656
something for ya.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.701
That's not it.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.413
- I hope you like them.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.413
- Oh.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.123
And I hope you like this.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.292
Ooh.

16:42.752 --> 16:46.088
Oh, Jesse, sapphire earrings.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.799
They're beautiful.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.759
Whoa!

16:49.801 --> 16:53.471
A genuine Elvis spoon.

16:49.801 --> 16:53.471
Thank you.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.890
I had no idea that

16:53.513 --> 16:55.890
you were gonna be extravagant.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.934
- I mean, if I'd known--

16:55.932 --> 16:57.934
- I love it, it's great, man.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.102
It's gonna go perfect with

16:57.976 --> 17:00.102
my Elvis cheese grater.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.230
- I've gotta try these on.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.230
- Alright.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.316
Let's see how they look.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.319
Alright.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.071
They're beautiful. Thank you.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.451
You know, Becky, uh, I'm glad

17:12.699 --> 17:15.451
you made me wait four months

17:15.493 --> 17:17.620
before I got to go out

17:15.493 --> 17:17.620
with you, you know?

17:17.662 --> 17:19.539
It gave us a chance
