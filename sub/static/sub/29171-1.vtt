WEBVTT

00:57.240 --> 00:59.310
- Getting it?
- How do I do this one?

00:59.480 --> 01:01.675
- Two similar things. Similar.
- Oh.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.353
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.875
Hey.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.216
I got a thing to take care of.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.240
Okay.

01:24.320 --> 01:27.073
You gonna make a big thing
of it, huh? Give me that.

01:27.440 --> 01:28.998
Give it to me.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.757
Fucking ice.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.239
What's that?

01:48.320 --> 01:49.456
Thought I told you
to get Schlitz.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
They were out.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.437
You're so fucking lazy.

01:53.720 --> 01:54.755
You know, tomorrow...

01:54.920 --> 01:56.016
I want you to walk
the extra block

01:56.040 --> 01:57.120
and get me the beer I like.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.909
Why aren't you writing?

02:36.080 --> 02:37.136
'Cause, man, we're over here

02:37.160 --> 02:38.912
watching paint dry, okay?
It's ridiculous.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.752
We're building a case.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.955
The Irish have
nothing except Hell's Kitchen.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.838
So pay attention.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.630
We're pushing
our fucking luck here.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.656
Jimmy, what the fuck you saying?

02:54.680 --> 02:55.680
Irish are all moving out.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.273
New people move in, we're done.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.840
We don't have control
anymore, okay?

02:58.960 --> 03:01.269
So this, right here,
this is about survival.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.816
Loans. We got to get into loans.

03:02.840 --> 03:03.909
Yeah, I heard, Rob.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.997
I know, loans. Jesus!

03:06.200 --> 03:07.496
You understand?
We do this one thing.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.520
We do one more hit,

03:08.600 --> 03:10.238
we have the cash to get started.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.435
One fucking thing, Jimmy.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.989
Jesus, let's fucking go.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.274
Are we good?

03:18.920 --> 03:21.434
Ah, let's just get it over with.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.360
Fucking hands
in the air, motherfucker!

03:40.520 --> 03:42.431
Hey! Open the fucking safe!

03:43.480 --> 03:45.516
Move it! Open the goddamn safe!

03:48.800 --> 03:50.760
This is Agent Martinez
requesting immediate backup

03:50.880 --> 03:52.632
to Cash & Carry Liquor
on 11th Avenue.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.280
Hey!

03:55.440 --> 03:56.759
FBI! On your knees!

03:57.080 --> 03:58.080
Ah.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.559
Get the fuck on your knees!

04:00.760 --> 04:02.336
What do you want?
What are you looking for?

04:02.360 --> 04:03.395
- Fuck you!
- Hey...

04:04.280 --> 04:05.280
Come on, huh?

04:09.960 --> 04:11.056
Think you run this neighborhood?

04:11.080 --> 04:12.080
You don't run shit.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.071
- We do. We do.
- Stay down.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.069
Let's go, Kevin. Let's go!

04:18.240 --> 04:19.240
Get off!

04:24.080 --> 04:25.176
Silvers, you all right?

04:25.200 --> 04:26.296
Stop right there.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.496
- Yeah.
- Right there.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.839
Arms down.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.993
On your heads!

04:36.320 --> 04:38.160
- What the hell?
- Transferring them to Rikers.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.816
- Not a fucking word.
- Come on, no stopping.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.432
- Let's go.
- Sorry, baby.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.516
Two counts assault
on a federal agent.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.835
Armed robbery.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Racketeering.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.280
I already called the lawyer.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.480
- Is this your wife?
- Yeah, it's my wife.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.760
- Seen it all.
- The fuck you say to me?

04:57.240 --> 04:58.680
Hey! Baby!

04:58.960 --> 05:01.520
We'll be home tomorrow.
Friday latest.

05:01.680 --> 05:02.795
Okay.

05:15.160 --> 05:18.277
No matter what, don't react.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.954
You are hereby
sentenced to three years.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.112
Sentences to be served
at Eastern Correctional.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.512
Congratulations.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.753
Come on.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.070
What's she doing
with Little Jackie?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.119
- Fuck Reggie Jackson.
- Mark!

06:16.280 --> 06:18.176
Thurman Munson's the
heart and soul of that team.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.634
Mark! Bring these over.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.800
He's the MVP.

06:21.920 --> 06:22.989
One more.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.296
Now shut the fuck up

06:24.320 --> 06:25.760
about the fucking Yankees,
all right?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.391
Here you go, Mrs. O'Carroll.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.514
Thank you.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.431
That's a thing to say?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.079
"Thank you"?

06:42.440 --> 06:44.032
Like I gave you a present.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.429
I didn't give you
a goddamn present.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.791
I didn't mean anything by it.

06:48.960 --> 06:52.111
I just, you know,
appreciate all this.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.998
Oh, you're grateful.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.276
Joseph was grateful

06:56.440 --> 06:59.591
when the wise men let Mary
push her kid out in the barn.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.637
He was grateful
'cause they let her

07:01.720 --> 07:03.438
lay down in the dirty
fucking hay

07:03.600 --> 07:05.955
after some other guy
knocked her up.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.035
Are you grateful like Joseph?

07:14.800 --> 07:17.030
Huh? You know
what happened to Joseph?

07:18.400 --> 07:19.400
Anyone?

07:19.560 --> 07:20.788
- No.
- No.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.758
Neither do I.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.595
Bible doesn't tell us.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.073
He just disappeared.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.190
Don't be fucking grateful.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.348
Your mother-in-law
is a real cunt.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.589
My beautiful daughter.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.589
To your health, Helen.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.876
And you, too, Jackie.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.712
Oh, shit.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.554
When Martin was sent up,

07:57.640 --> 07:59.312
I mailed him cookies every week.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.550
Every week for two years.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.153
Kevin doesn't like cookies.

08:03.320 --> 08:07.029
I never much understood
why Kevin likes what he likes.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.995
You
girls are gonna be just fine.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.710
You never worried about
any of thiS before.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.393
Don't worry about it now.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.596
Nothing's gonna change.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.079
We're gonna take care of you.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.395
Hey...

08:20.920 --> 08:23.480
Family, right?

08:26.080 --> 08:28.753
You fucking twats.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.198
I'm gonna say good night to Dad.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.712
Okay.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.470
- Night.
- Kath...

08:41.640 --> 08:42.775
The kidS already
got their coats on.

08:42.799 --> 08:43.799
Kathy.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.712
Are you gonna be okay?

08:47.920 --> 08:48.920
Of course.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.513
Well, you need money?

08:51.480 --> 08:52.936
Dad, you haven't worked
in three months.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.016
Yeah, but if you need money...

08:54.040 --> 08:55.040
We've got some saved.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.474
Enough for three years?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.356
They're gonna take care of us.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.630
Oh, so that's how it works
with them. IS that it?

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
Like you don't know.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.456
No, those are your mother's
people. Not mine.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.480
Okay, Dad.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.359
Look, you keep taking
money like that.

09:10.520 --> 09:11.520
Profiting.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.268
What happens
when you go to jail?

09:15.640 --> 09:16.993
What happens to the kids?

09:17.200 --> 09:19.191
- The kidS are cooked.
- Yeah, okay.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.468
- Night.
- Yeah.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.109
Okay, let'S go. Come on.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.216
My piece was definitely
bigger than yours.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.376
They gave me a bigger fork

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
so I could eat more.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.736
Well, at least mine tasted good.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.400
Okay, enough, enough.
Go brush your teeth.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.755
- Go brush your teeth.
- Fine.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.112
Kathy Brennan.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.080
Unemployment iS
at near record highs.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.873
What happens
when one of your kids

10:00.960 --> 10:02.279
gets sick
and you got to call in?

10:03.000 --> 10:06.310
Most employers don't want
mothers with young kidS.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.152
It'S a competitive market.

10:08.320 --> 10:11.869
Employers are looking for
people they can depend on.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.474
You don't know me.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.871
And you got shit in your teeth.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.120
What can I get for you?

10:22.200 --> 10:23.633
You got a little
something for this?

10:26.120 --> 10:28.156
You got to go talk to Helen.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.958
She's your mother-in-law.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.119
ThankS.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.918
If I confront Helen,

10:34.080 --> 10:36.116
I don't know
how She's gonna take it.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.073
Kevin's gone
for the next three years.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.896
That'S plenty of time
for Helen to figure out

10:40.920 --> 10:42.520
some kinda way
to kill me in an accident.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.030
We need to talk to the guys.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.997
And we need to talk
to the guyS together.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.195
Oh, I don't think you need me
in there mucking it up.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.516
What, you want me to walk
in there all by myself

10:53.600 --> 10:55.113
with those motherfuckers?

10:55.640 --> 10:57.949
They didn't want me in
the family in the first place.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.031
I'll just take
whatever they give me.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.714
I'm not confronting them
or anything.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.473
Rob took care of you?

11:04.680 --> 11:06.830
When has Rob
ever taken care of me?

11:08.040 --> 11:10.156
I have $43 in the bank.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.360
I can't even make the rent

11:11.480 --> 11:12.993
with what they gave me
last night.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.630
Claire, I went out there
this morning, okay?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.472
To a job bank.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.710
But there's nothing out there.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.236
There iS no place
for us out there. None.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.556
I'm volunteering
at church today.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.838
I can get a job.

11:29.360 --> 11:30.873
I'm not taking on those guys.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.272
Who'S gonna hire you?

11:33.440 --> 11:34.793
Besides getting hit,

11:35.080 --> 11:36.593
what other skills do you got?

11:45.280 --> 11:46.918
That's too much.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.273
What are we gonna do?

11:49.440 --> 11:51.476
Well,
you're the smarter one here.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.393
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.669
Hey, baby. You want me
to warm you up, hmm?

12:04.720 --> 12:06.312
Fucking bitch.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.416
Man, you talk about
humming down the highway,

12:08.440 --> 12:09.480
that sucker will haul aSS.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.200
Hey, Duff, you still driving
that piece of Shit

12:13.320 --> 12:15.595
with the hole in the floor
next to the clutch?

12:15.680 --> 12:17.318
Yeah.

12:23.720 --> 12:24.789
Hey.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.673
Hey, fellas.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.594
Duff.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.352
Hey, Colin, how'S your mom?

12:30.560 --> 12:31.595
She's good. Yeah.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.273
Good, good.

12:35.240 --> 12:37.549
We, uh, we don't wanna
be a bother. We just, uh...

12:37.640 --> 12:39.551
We just need a minute,

12:39.800 --> 12:42.678
and I made you
some cookies, so...

12:47.760 --> 12:49.273
What can we do for you?

12:49.360 --> 12:52.238
Um... Well, we got our money.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
You know, our envelopes.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.788
You're welcome.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.193
Yes, and thank you.
I just, uh...

12:59.520 --> 13:01.680
There was leSS in it than
what we were expecting and...

13:02.200 --> 13:03.269
So...

13:03.880 --> 13:07.077
what exactly were you expecting?

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
Huh?

13:12.840 --> 13:15.559
How much were you
expecting from me?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.513
Payments are down.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.395
The collections are down?
Who'S not paying?

13:21.560 --> 13:23.357
- The Murphys, Hogan...
- Hey!

13:23.520 --> 13:25.556
Who'S talking? You talking?

13:28.640 --> 13:31.677
I meant, you know,
if it would help or anything,

13:31.840 --> 13:34.638
if people aren't paying,
I would be happy

13:34.800 --> 13:37.109
to go talk to them for you.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
Yeah, okay.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.478
You're not talking to anyone.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.797
You're not collecting.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.310
I run Shit now! Me!

13:50.480 --> 13:52.152
She's got kids.

13:52.320 --> 13:55.517
You will be happy

13:56.160 --> 13:59.232
with whatever fucking money

13:59.600 --> 14:01.716
I decide to give you

14:02.720 --> 14:06.793
out of the kindness of my heart.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.509
Now get the fuck out.

14:12.880 --> 14:13.949
Hmm?

14:28.840 --> 14:29.896
You wanna paSS the cookies?

14:29.920 --> 14:31.512
Shut the fuck up, Burns!

14:38.320 --> 14:39.799
Hey, hey, hey.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.599
Didn't Burns say Hogan's
was holding out on us?

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
Yeah.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.475
Hey. DRIVER: Hey!

14:52.480 --> 14:53.993
I kept back 50
because that money

14:54.120 --> 14:55.400
is supposed to be
for protection.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.829
And they stopped protecting
as far as I can see.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.712
What do you mean
they stopped protecting?

15:02.520 --> 15:04.397
Two kidS in here last week.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.879
Stole ice creams out the back.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.393
Not from around here, you know?

15:07.560 --> 15:10.279
This week,
kidS came back with a gun.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.271
Took me for a whole day's money.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.431
I reached out to Little Jackie.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.672
Never even called me back.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.309
Yeah.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.839
I'm sorry.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.638
- Thank you.
- Of course.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.473
You know the rules.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.272
If you're high, you don't eat.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.990
Sober up. Come back tomorrow.

15:46.920 --> 15:47.989
Hey.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.791
We got to deal
with our Situation.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.536
All these men
working these streets

15:54.560 --> 15:56.596
and not a solid
set of balls anywhere.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.149
Fuck balls. Where have they
ever gotten any of us?

15:59.320 --> 16:00.958
It doesn't take balls
to do thiS work.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.594
It'S about being smart.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.875
It'S about, you know,
taking care of people.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.192
People respect you.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.113
You could do this.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.000
They have been
telling uS forever

16:12.080 --> 16:13.479
that we are never
gonna do anything

16:13.640 --> 16:14.959
but have babies.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.118
And now we got no degree.
We got no money.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.793
Piece-of-shit bunch of guys

16:19.880 --> 16:22.269
that don't even remember
what family means.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.271
So we remind them.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.388
We could.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.271
I mean, we really could.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.754
You know, this Hogan Situation.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.070
People have issues, you know?

16:38.240 --> 16:39.456
And they're waiting for somebody

16:39.480 --> 16:40.896
to Show up
and actually deal with it.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.672
We could do that.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.314
We take over the collections,

16:45.440 --> 16:47.670
we can actually
make good on our word.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.912
We could do this.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.038
Sister, let me help you.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.509
Oh, yes, uh, take the top
three to Father's office.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.874
Of course.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.269
Get... Get outta here.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
No, no, no!

17:21.839 --> 17:24.035
All right. Okay. It'S okay.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.954
They got the guy. Arrested him.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.416
Three stitches ain't so bad.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.034
I'm in here every other week
with Peter for three stitches.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.428
No.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.715
My whole life, you know?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.956
I've been knocked around.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.836
When I lost the baby...

17:44.000 --> 17:45.831
I said that'S it.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.955
It'S not gonna happen again.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.755
That lasted two monthS.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.872
Then Rob hit me again,

17:54.960 --> 17:57.190
and I stuck around
because I'm...

17:59.680 --> 18:01.989
You're not weak.
You're not weak.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.355
The homeless guy knows.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.631
A stranger sees
he can baSh me around.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.075
I got three years, maybe leSS,

18:12.520 --> 18:14.397
before Rob is home.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.152
I can't.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.029
I am not gonna get knocked
around ever again, okay?

18:22.480 --> 18:24.755
I think we're all done
being fucking knocked around.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.195
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we are.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.715
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.034
- Sorry.
- It'S okay.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.956
He pays them when the sun is up,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.588
when it's down, and we don't
get nothing for it.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.511
- Huh?
- I said you give away

18:45.600 --> 18:47.830
our money and you don't
get nothing for it.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.392
Need a hand?

18:51.640 --> 18:53.256
Forty years, we pay protection

18:53.280 --> 18:54.759
and never bothered me a bit,

18:54.840 --> 18:56.558
'cause I knew
if I had a problem,

18:56.800 --> 18:59.030
guy like your grandfather
would take care of it.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.633
Now?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.758
Anything you need,
we're here for you.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.512
I mean, I could have the kids

19:04.600 --> 19:05.919
come over tomorrow afierschool

19:06.120 --> 19:09.192
and wash that graffiti
off the windows for you.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.633
That would be a help.
Look at him.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.916
He can't do anything anymore,
he's so old.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.112
Bet you still can cut a rug.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.913
Oh, yeah.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.992
You know what,
what do I care if I pay you

19:26.080 --> 19:28.230
or I pay Jackie Quinn
and his numbskulls?

19:34.880 --> 19:37.519
I don't know.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.432
Jackie's not gonna like this.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.070
We'll talk to him.
I'm not looking for a war.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.794
Duff, you're my cousin.
You're blood.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.349
Kevin and the others get out,
who are the first two guyS

19:48.440 --> 19:49.760
they're gonna
come take a look at?

19:50.840 --> 19:53.673
So, I know you're not
looking for trouble.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.394
Problem is, you don't
help me out with this,

19:56.480 --> 19:57.840
trouble might come
looking for you.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.353
- Lwent high.
- Over my head!

20:06.800 --> 20:09.917
My girl called in,
so I can't do hair.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.834
Yeah, we're not here
for hair, Donna.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.392
You want nails?

20:15.560 --> 20:16.993
- Pick your color.
- No, uh...

20:18.560 --> 20:20.949
We know that your girl
didn't call in.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.032
She can't get her
cosmetology license, right?

20:24.240 --> 20:25.514
How you hear that?

20:25.680 --> 20:26.999
I got a cousin.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.236
In the Division of Licensing.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.311
He could, you know,
help speed things along.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.232
Get her permitted.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.519
What do you want?

20:35.720 --> 20:38.109
We want you to start paying us.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.840
And we will make sure that you
get something for it.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.718
What about Little Jackie?

20:42.880 --> 20:45.519
Anything he's owed,
we'll get it to him.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.389
Uh...

21:51.200 --> 21:53.316
Here you go.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.879
Wake up!

22:00.040 --> 22:01.553
- Get up! Move!
- Come on!

22:05.320 --> 22:07.436
This is my motherfucking block!

22:11.240 --> 22:13.549
This neighborhood
haS been family-run

22:13.640 --> 22:15.710
Since we got to America.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.878
This is our land.
And this store is your birthright.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.320
And if anybody screws with that,

22:20.400 --> 22:21.879
we will deal with them.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.792
You holding up okay?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.592
Guys taking care of you?

22:48.800 --> 22:50.313
We're okay.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.114
I'm taking care of myself.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.997
What's that mean?

22:56.880 --> 22:59.269
Our money was a little light,

22:59.480 --> 23:02.677
so Claire, Ruby and me,
we're helping out.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.068
- Kathy...
- It'S nothing.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.639
Hi, Kathy.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.439
Hey, Kevin.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.272
No Ruby?

23:10.280 --> 23:11.508
Do you see Ruby?

23:12.160 --> 23:13.160
No.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.988
I don't see Ruby.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.316
Then I guess She's not here.

23:26.960 --> 23:30.236
Whatever you're doing,
stop it. Now.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.233
My God, I lost count again.

23:39.800 --> 23:40.949
- Seven.
- Don't.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.519
- Thirteen.
- No. Don't.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.029
- Twenty-two. Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.031
I can't do it.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.552
- It'S working.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.640
AS far as I can see,

23:51.720 --> 23:54.439
we just need one more
piece of the puzzle.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.160
What do you want?

24:04.320 --> 24:05.680
The FBI still
watching the Kitchen?

24:05.760 --> 24:06.760
What do you think?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.656
The FBI tells me everything
they got going on?

24:08.680 --> 24:09.680
How Should I know?

24:09.880 --> 24:11.279
What do you know?

24:11.440 --> 24:13.396
No, no. As far as I know,

24:13.560 --> 24:15.710
they rolled outta here
after they got your husbands.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.313
What about NYPD?

24:17.680 --> 24:19.238
Are they on us?

24:19.400 --> 24:20.753
Who is "us"?

24:22.240 --> 24:25.471
I saw, uh,
Carol and your kids out there.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.359
Nice you take 'em out
to dinner once in a while.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.280
Does Carol know where
her rabbit vest came from?

24:31.440 --> 24:33.396
Or her Gucci bag?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.638
The Gucci bag'S a fake,
by the way.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.760
Jimmy told me it was real,

24:36.880 --> 24:39.075
but I took it to a guy
who said that it's a knockoff.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.231
Does Carol know that?

24:42.800 --> 24:43.800
Please...

24:44.320 --> 24:45.912
I'm begging you.
Could you just...

24:46.080 --> 24:48.355
We don't want you
helping Little Jackie.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.917
And we especially
don't wanna hear

24:51.000 --> 24:53.116
that you didn't tell us
something important.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.709
Our husbands think

24:54.800 --> 24:56.496
you should have known
they were being watched.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.431
I told them. I swear to God.
I had no idea.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.736
I should probably
get outta the bathroom,

25:05.760 --> 25:07.955
othenNise people gonna that
you're blowing me in here.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.475
I'm gonna wash my hands later.

25:10.640 --> 25:11.789
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

25:11.960 --> 25:15.191
I just need to squeeze,
scooch in here.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.555
I'm gonna unlock it and go.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.296
Were you getting
your fucking nails done?

25:47.320 --> 25:48.320
What took you so long?

25:48.440 --> 25:50.635
They said they already paid
for the week.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.474
Fucking girls
are a serious problem.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.348
Hmm.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.954
It'S not that funny.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.799
Oh, Shit!

26:16.280 --> 26:17.998
- You got everything?
- Yeah.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.991
All right. Be good, okay?

26:20.160 --> 26:22.754
- There he is.
- Grandpa!

26:23.760 --> 26:25.432
Hi. Hey.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.870
I'll be by around 10.

26:29.640 --> 26:30.776
All right, come on, kidS.
Let's go.

26:30.800 --> 26:31.800
Dad.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.553
Dad!

26:36.560 --> 26:38.073
We got a problem.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.834
We can't do this no more.
Little Jackie's pissed.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.433
You said you'd talk to him,

26:42.520 --> 26:44.000
tell him we weren't
going against him.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.256
Little Jackie's not
handling the busineSS...

26:45.280 --> 26:46.190
I don't give a Shit.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.736
Look, you're nice girlS
and, Kathy, I love you.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.296
I respect you want to
do things the right way,

26:49.320 --> 26:50.753
but whoop-de-fucking-do.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.916
I ain't dying for thiS shit.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.992
Later.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.456
I mean, if
Little Jackie's mad at them,

27:01.480 --> 27:02.840
he's definitely
gonna be mad at us.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.199
So?

27:04.400 --> 27:05.400
So?

27:05.840 --> 27:07.353
He's vicious.

27:07.560 --> 27:08.560
You think we're giving up

27:08.640 --> 27:10.676
because of these fucking idiots?

27:24.200 --> 27:26.555
We need to talk.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.671
Huh?

27:30.960 --> 27:33.076
You're over, Jackie.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.280
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.755
Yeah? I could say it louder.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.797
You know, family or not,

27:49.360 --> 27:53.114
you were anyone else,
you'd be dead already.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.590
Told you
he wasn't gonna do nothing.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.191
Always was weak.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.073
Lock your fucking doors.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.230
I don't know
what you want from me.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.792
I don't control every
little thing Jackie does.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.998
That right?

28:46.120 --> 28:47.838
That'S right.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.957
Well, what are you saying?
What Should we do?

28:58.240 --> 29:00.117
Run.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.878
Kathy.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.509
Ma, I'm coming.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.356
Back up. Hey.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.116
KidS need clean stuff
for school.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.200
Okay.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.376
Did you sleep in your clothes?

29:44.400 --> 29:46.356
- Just come in.
- What'S going on?

30:09.640 --> 30:12.393
I don't like knowing
you down there with them.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.949
You remember
when you were seven?

30:27.160 --> 30:29.833
You had that teacher
overdosed in the bathroom.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.435
I ain't had no teacher...
You did.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.718
That white guy.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.791
He was out Sick.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.072
With a needle in his arm.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.957
What are you, stupid?

30:41.120 --> 30:42.792
I was 7.

30:44.320 --> 30:47.392
You made that
motherfucker a card.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.630
All the other parents
looked at you

30:50.720 --> 30:53.314
with glue and shit
all over your hands.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.630
Whole neighborhood
knowing you soft.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.517
Fucking humiliating.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.113
IS that why you beat me
when we got home?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.679
Our family aren't fighters.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.997
They all "yes'm" and Shit.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.559
Look at your father.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.558
Shit I had to put up with
from him.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.916
Ibeatyou,
because I knew I had to run

31:17.000 --> 31:19.036
that soft shit right outta you.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.191
Like driving out the devil.

31:26.200 --> 31:30.398
This... why I beat you.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.080
Claire.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.115
Gabriel?

32:16.720 --> 32:18.676
You okay?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.711
Um...

33:15.960 --> 33:18.076
This doesn't feel good.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.550
It feels really bad.

33:21.720 --> 33:25.156
That I needed you
to come along and save me.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.911
I heard he was back in town.
I called him up.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.036
Why did you call him?
He's a psychopath.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.639
He's a vet, and he's messed up.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.189
We don't need a man coming in
here and fighting our battles.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.510
The motherfuckers out there
think we do.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.033
The men need us to have a man.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.269
Enough.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.636
Gabriel saved my life.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.995
And I'm not sorry
Little Jackie is dead.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.513
Are you?

33:57.680 --> 33:59.875
Easiest to break
the limbs down first.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.110
Gives us more room to play with.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.510
So, you wanna work
the knife in here

34:04.960 --> 34:06.996
behind the knee, where its soft.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.393
There.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.829
So you push through here.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.717
Right. Take it out

34:14.920 --> 34:17.114
like this and you flip the knife

34:18.440 --> 34:20.556
and you cut down.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.317
That'S the hard part.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.148
Turn the knife
back around again.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.635
Get up back through
where you came from,

34:29.800 --> 34:31.518
back and around,

34:31.679 --> 34:32.998
And once you got through that,

34:33.320 --> 34:35.788
you break the leg. Like this.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.750
Fucking right...

34:39.960 --> 34:42.076
There.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.275
I'm gonna Skip ahead.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.195
The most important part,

34:47.360 --> 34:49.157
you got to Slice open
the abdomen

34:49.239 --> 34:50.514
and stab out both the lungs.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.272
Those places hold onto air.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.789
You don't do that, you put
the torso in the river,

34:54.960 --> 34:56.154
the torso floats to the top,

34:56.280 --> 34:58.953
and then you got real problems.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.630
So, long knife.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.799
You come down through here.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.638
I can't. I can't...

35:21.000 --> 35:23.116
Can I do the other leg?

35:25.960 --> 35:27.075
Sure.

35:34.360 --> 35:37.557
The currents here have
always been good for this.

35:40.880 --> 35:41.880
Anything you give it,

35:41.960 --> 35:43.871
the river will take
right out to sea.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.950
You been gone
a long time, Gabriel.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.275
Yeah.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.078
Almost two years.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.992
Because of work I did
for your husbands.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.030
- Andrew O'Connor.
- Billy Walsh.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.673
Both of them, yeah.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.708
I went out west. I laid low.

36:01.880 --> 36:04.872
It blew over. I came back.

36:05.040 --> 36:09.079
But just to be clear,
now we run this neighborhood.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.519
Hey. Hey!

36:37.080 --> 36:39.719
You're off the street now.
You work with us.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.751
Come on.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.917
So you're gonna start
fucking following us

36:59.080 --> 37:00.920
and then everything'S gonna
get a lot smoother.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.069
Okay?

37:02.280 --> 37:03.536
And don't roll your fucking eyes

37:03.560 --> 37:04.879
when I'm talking to you.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.198
Psst. Baby.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.794
Come here.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.269
You got to trust us. Right?

37:41.440 --> 37:42.793
Hi, Mrs. O'Carroll.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.393
Ah, Giovani.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.278
What can I get you?

37:46.440 --> 37:48.192
I got to think about that.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.310
Hello, Helen.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.639
- The hell you...
- Shut the fuck up now.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.310
I deserve better.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.869
Oh, you got a problem
with the personnel change?

38:05.040 --> 38:07.759
Neither of you get to say.
I do. I say what's what.

38:08.240 --> 38:11.312
Yeah? Your husband,
your son, Jackie.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.833
I thought it was all on them.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.956
Now you get to say?

38:15.680 --> 38:17.875
Kevin's out
in a couple of years.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.517
I raised him right.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.469
One good thing I done.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.999
Till then, knock yourself out.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.319
Yeah. Knock yourself out.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.390
- Okay. We'll do that.
- Yeah.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.512
I don't...

38:48.960 --> 38:51.394
I don't want you to do it.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.754
I want you to teach me
how to do it.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.799
Okay.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.510
ItsoundS really nice out west.

39:11.880 --> 39:12.880
Hmm.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.631
Could've stayed.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.395
Why'd you come back?

39:24.680 --> 39:27.513
I heard Rob was away
for three years.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.239
Thought...

39:32.280 --> 39:34.635
Thought now might be the time.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.633
For what?

39:38.640 --> 39:40.119
For you.

39:42.640 --> 39:45.518
I can make my own choices.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.438
I know.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.077
But if you've got problems,
you come talk to us.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.117
Problem is
the city'S going to Shit.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.554
You gonna fix that?

40:13.080 --> 40:14.274
No, but I'm gonna make sure

40:14.360 --> 40:15.918
they don't fuck
with Hell's Kitchen.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.149
You speak Jewish?

40:19.120 --> 40:21.714
You talk to them
over on 47th Street.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.279
So, what can I do for you?

40:30.440 --> 40:33.318
Oh, Mr. Kanfer, we're
not here to sell you diamonds.

40:34.200 --> 40:36.879
I thought that...
Can we talk alone?

40:37.080 --> 40:38.080
I'm sorry, no.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.435
It'S not proper, uh,
for me to be alone with...

40:41.160 --> 40:42.388
She's my niece.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.071
The empty lot out there.

40:47.240 --> 40:51.153
You filed planS with the city
for a 28-Story building.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.918
When do you start construction?

40:54.320 --> 40:56.356
How exactly can I help you?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.752
And why is it
that you're not using

40:58.840 --> 41:02.389
any union contractors
to do the work? Hmm?

41:05.920 --> 41:07.114
Are you from Hell's Kitchen?

41:09.440 --> 41:10.998
Then this conversation is over.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.310
We're just here to talk
about your options.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.550
I can build my buildings
however I choose.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.640
That'S my option.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.950
Oh. Except we're your
neighbors, you know?

41:19.080 --> 41:20.911
Just a few blocks away.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.759
We could look in on the Site,
make sure that,

41:23.840 --> 41:25.416
you know, everything is
running smoothly.

41:25.440 --> 41:28.477
You can't put a price tag
on skilled laborers, huh?

41:28.640 --> 41:29.868
I don't need your help.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.951
Or the help
of whoever you work for.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.031
Oh, we don't work for anyone.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.096
Well, in this neighborhood
we take care of our own.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.712
Oh, see, you don't.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.712
You can't.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.874
Rachel, uh, could you
get me a coffee?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.198
We get help from Brooklyn.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.590
Fuck Brooklyn. They're across
the river. We're here.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.352
Get the hell outta my office.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.839
Now.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.558
I can see you got brains.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.193
And I know you got money.

42:10.520 --> 42:13.432
But we got one thing
that you don't.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.916
We got criminals.

42:18.440 --> 42:21.512
And they're right down
the street.

42:28.560 --> 42:29.629
I 'chaim.

42:33.480 --> 42:34.799
There.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.359
That'S him.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.317
You do it fast, you do it clean.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.912
I know.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.358
And be confident.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.630
You don't run.
Runners call attention.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.479
I know.

42:55.680 --> 42:56.999
You got your glove?

43:03.360 --> 43:04.360
All right.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.233
We're blocked in!
You kidding me?

43:41.400 --> 43:42.833
Goddamn it!

43:47.080 --> 43:48.911
What the fuck are you doing?

43:49.080 --> 43:51.594
You can't be here
all fucking day!

43:51.840 --> 43:52.909
Oh!

44:14.760 --> 44:16.637
Kid always had an attitude.

44:18.760 --> 44:20.193
Wait.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.911
This one'S sharper.

44:23.400 --> 44:24.400
ThankS.

44:50.880 --> 44:52.233
Okay. All right.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.958
This is him.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.078
We have to work
with these people.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.117
You want us to work
with those Irish dogs?

45:03.280 --> 45:04.280
Women, too.

45:04.360 --> 45:06.096
What kind of people
let their women do thiS work?

45:06.120 --> 45:07.917
We agree to a union contract.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.200
It'S not worth going to war.

45:09.280 --> 45:10.429
What about Brooklyn?

45:10.920 --> 45:12.536
- We pay them good money.
- I called.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.680
Do you see them around here?

45:13.800 --> 45:15.296
They take our money.
We never see them again.

45:15.320 --> 45:17.709
Meanwhile, we got bums,
we got drug pushers...

45:17.880 --> 45:19.871
Traffic, garbage.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.910
It'S getting so that they're
leaving us no choice.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.230
There's always a choice.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.914
I think this time, there's not.

45:42.800 --> 45:43.800
Whoa.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.552
- Another.
- You got it, Kathy.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.395
It's on me.

46:02.880 --> 46:06.031
Eight months of work. Thank you.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.388
You're welcome.

46:15.960 --> 46:17.029
Hmm.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.959
We had a holdout.
One of the jewelers.

46:37.080 --> 46:38.672
Oh, Christ.

46:38.840 --> 46:39.840
They're fucking.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.070
Mmm-hmm. I could smell it
when I sat down.

47:25.720 --> 47:26.755
No way.

47:26.920 --> 47:28.990
No fuckin' way. Silvers!

47:30.400 --> 47:32.277
- SilverS!
- Yeah.

47:32.440 --> 47:33.589
Hey.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.639
The HaSidic guy killed a few
months back out in Brooklyn?

47:36.800 --> 47:38.153
Ballistics is back.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.799
Same gun used to kill those two

47:39.880 --> 47:41.711
out in Hell's Kitchen
a couple years ago.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.553
The ones found in the dumpster.

47:43.640 --> 47:45.080
Remember? With the...

47:46.360 --> 47:47.360
Come on, man.

47:47.520 --> 47:49.988
How is this Jewish guy
tied into Hell'S Kitchen?

47:50.160 --> 47:51.434
I don't know.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.308
Fucking Irish.

47:53.480 --> 47:55.118
I need the files from June '76,

47:55.200 --> 47:57.668
homicides of William Walsh
and Andrew O'Connor.

48:05.080 --> 48:06.672
You Kathy Brennan?

48:06.840 --> 48:08.398
Who the fuck are you?

48:08.640 --> 48:10.915
Alfonso Coretti
wantS to talk with you.

48:13.280 --> 48:14.872
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 10.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.473
Bring the other two girls, huh?

48:16.720 --> 48:18.915
What other two girls?

48:19.800 --> 48:22.030
They said you were smart.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.232
Be smart.

48:27.400 --> 48:29.549
Okay...
Gabriel's got to follow us.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.596
Someone knows
where we are, we'll be okay.

48:31.840 --> 48:35.833
If we get in the car and
go to Brooklyn, we're dead.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.197
If he wanted you dead,
you'd already be dead.

48:39.440 --> 48:40.936
What do you wear
to something like that?

48:40.960 --> 48:42.188
You get dressed up?

48:44.400 --> 48:46.072
You fucking kidding?

48:47.200 --> 48:48.599
No.

48:48.960 --> 48:49.960
What?

49:55.800 --> 49:57.711
Get you girls a drink?

49:58.120 --> 49:59.314
No, thanks.

49:59.480 --> 50:01.152
I'll take a whiskey.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.759
Yeah, me too.

50:03.320 --> 50:05.709
'Course the Irish ones
take the drink.

50:06.280 --> 50:08.077
'Course the Italian one's
a dick.

50:08.240 --> 50:10.595
Now, now, with the name-calling.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.237
Alfonso Coretti.

50:14.560 --> 50:17.472
We don't wanna traffic
in stereotypes, do we, Ruby?

50:18.520 --> 50:19.953
Mrs. Brennan.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.197
Your husband,
he tried to reach out to me

50:22.280 --> 50:23.918
on a few occasions,

50:24.120 --> 50:27.317
but he was never important
enough to be worth my time.

50:30.200 --> 50:32.520
Claire, you're the one I have
to watch out for, aren't you?

50:34.920 --> 50:36.876
Please, I won't bite.

50:37.040 --> 50:39.998
Least not today. Please.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.629
You girls have been very busy.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.148
Maybe the Jews went with you,

50:50.320 --> 50:54.359
because all your womanhood
got under their Skin.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.670
Our Hasidic partners
went with us

50:57.760 --> 51:00.274
because they know good business.

51:00.440 --> 51:02.237
The one you Shot dead
on his stoop,

51:02.400 --> 51:05.233
I bet he doesn't think so.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.636
We don't Shoot people.
That'S your world.

51:07.720 --> 51:08.755
Hmm.

51:08.840 --> 51:11.070
We have
a dick-measuring contest,

51:11.160 --> 51:12.309
I'm gonna win.

51:12.760 --> 51:15.752
You are not fucking
smarter than me.

51:21.680 --> 51:23.830
For what you did to me,

51:24.000 --> 51:25.991
for taking my business...

51:27.400 --> 51:32.235
I am within rights to wipe you
off the face of the earth.

51:33.720 --> 51:35.358
But I won't.

51:37.680 --> 51:40.114
Because we are going to go
into business together,

51:40.240 --> 51:41.355
you and me.

51:41.520 --> 51:42.999
We're fine on our own.

51:43.280 --> 51:44.349
Okay.

51:45.600 --> 51:47.750
And when your husbands get out
in four months,

51:47.920 --> 51:50.195
they're gonna be fine
with the new arrangement

51:50.280 --> 51:52.191
with you being in charge?

51:53.080 --> 51:54.672
Our husbands have 24 more months

51:54.760 --> 51:56.318
left on their sentences.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.950
They're getting out
in four months.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.079
You didn't know?

52:02.440 --> 52:05.079
Well, turns out
I have my fingers

52:05.160 --> 52:07.196
in a few more pies than you do.

52:08.280 --> 52:10.794
So, what do you think, Ruby?

52:10.960 --> 52:15.272
IS Kevin gonna be copacetic
with the new arrangement?

52:15.480 --> 52:17.118
It seems to me,

52:17.200 --> 52:19.839
all your Mick relatives
are gonna turn on you.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.195
Might be a good idea
to have me at your back.

52:22.360 --> 52:23.634
So, if you've got our backs,

52:23.720 --> 52:25.790
how much is that gonna cost US?

52:29.240 --> 52:31.276
You know what's going on
in the rail yards

52:31.360 --> 52:33.191
south of 42nd Street?

52:33.360 --> 52:35.430
Well, south of 42nd Street

52:35.520 --> 52:38.193
is Shaping up to be
a new convention center.

52:38.360 --> 52:40.954
Almost two million square feet.

52:41.360 --> 52:44.557
Biggest construction job
the city's had in years.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.376
They've been talking about it
for 20 years.

52:46.400 --> 52:47.628
Yeah.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.150
Some millionaire's kid.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.159
Little shit-for-brains,

52:52.240 --> 52:54.117
he finally coughed up the land.

52:54.280 --> 52:55.395
It'S happening.

52:55.880 --> 52:57.791
And I want in.

52:57.960 --> 53:00.315
Any work that happens
in our neighborhood

53:00.400 --> 53:01.992
is gonna be for our people.

53:02.160 --> 53:06.199
They say construction's
gonna take five, Six years.

53:06.360 --> 53:08.476
And I want some of my people

53:08.560 --> 53:11.996
to have a chance to
participate in all those jobs.

53:12.160 --> 53:15.436
I want an alliance
with the Irish.

53:17.640 --> 53:19.278
I have to...

53:19.720 --> 53:22.359
I will take what I need.

53:22.800 --> 53:23.994
I don't want to.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.153
I don't wanna fight.

53:27.680 --> 53:30.319
There's room
for everybody, right?

53:33.720 --> 53:35.153
We want more.

53:35.560 --> 53:39.439
32nd up to 59th. East and west.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.752
Do you know what you're asking?

53:43.920 --> 53:45.797
Yeah, I do.

53:47.360 --> 53:48.952
You got our back?

53:53.600 --> 53:55.955
I got every part of you.

53:58.360 --> 54:01.193
Well, I know your guy, Gabriel,

54:01.280 --> 54:02.679
he's waiting outside for you.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.958
He's good for you.
He gives you legitimacy.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.348
Have you given any thought

54:10.440 --> 54:12.795
to what you'd do
if he goes back to Kevin?

54:13.560 --> 54:14.834
Gabriel's with us.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.149
But if he'S not.

54:16.320 --> 54:17.548
If he goes back.

54:18.120 --> 54:20.236
Claire'll put a bullet
in his head.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.750
You girls kill me.

54:27.200 --> 54:28.792
You asked for too much.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.669
I asked for what we deserved,
and we got it.

54:31.840 --> 54:34.673
You know what's involved,
running that much of the city?

54:41.160 --> 54:42.673
You the Irish girls?

54:42.880 --> 54:44.871
Yeah, we the Irish girls.

54:45.640 --> 54:47.358
I'm Maria Coretti.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.872
Good for you.

54:50.400 --> 54:54.234
All Gloria Steinem and Shit.
You give those guyS hell.

55:00.480 --> 55:01.480
Hey.

55:02.240 --> 55:04.913
Don't ever threaten Gabriel
like that again.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.432
Itslocked.

55:15.440 --> 55:16.714
Sorry.

55:21.440 --> 55:23.317
They're getting out
in four months.

55:24.520 --> 55:27.114
We'll use these monthS
to lock it down.

55:27.440 --> 55:29.158
Even our husbands
will never touch us.

55:29.760 --> 55:32.354
For Christ's sake,
I'm not afraid of Jimmy.

55:32.920 --> 55:36.151
We'll see which one of us
is right, won't we?

55:40.240 --> 55:42.800
The more you collect,
the more you make.

55:42.960 --> 55:45.349
I get rich, you get rich.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.272
We're gonna take care
of everybody.

55:47.480 --> 55:50.358
Five years of work is more
stability than we've ever had!

55:53.000 --> 55:56.436
Happy to do it.
Happy to do it. Really.

55:57.920 --> 55:58.920
Thanks, Larry.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.269
Must be proud.

56:03.080 --> 56:06.390
Hey, you Sit.
Let me get you a beer.

56:06.560 --> 56:07.993
Let me get you three,
if you like.

56:08.080 --> 56:10.310
Oh. One's good. ThankS, Scotty.

56:15.120 --> 56:17.475
Have I been unclear about
my feelings for all this?

56:17.680 --> 56:19.636
- I did all this for you.
- No.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.313
You get five years of work.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.136
That's more than you've
ever seen in your whole life.

56:23.160 --> 56:25.390
Every day I did have
was an honest day.

56:25.560 --> 56:28.552
Not like this. Not like you.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.638
So I'm trash, right, huh?

56:31.040 --> 56:32.917
No, you married trash.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.080
He gave you two beautiful
kidS, I'll give you that.

56:35.240 --> 56:38.312
But God knows he wasn't worth
throwing your life away.

56:38.480 --> 56:41.119
I'm not throwing my life away.
I've never felt stronger.

56:41.280 --> 56:43.157
You're a criminal, Kathy.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.879
We didn't raise you like this.

56:45.960 --> 56:47.996
We're good people,
your mother and me.

56:48.160 --> 56:49.479
You brought me up here.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.073
What did you expect, huh?

56:51.200 --> 56:53.395
You could have moved US out
to the Island or to Jersey.

56:53.560 --> 56:55.198
But you didn't,
and you know why?

56:55.360 --> 56:56.190
Because out there,

56:56.280 --> 56:57.616
you're nothing
but an uneducated immigrant

56:57.640 --> 56:58.675
and you can't face that.

56:58.840 --> 56:59.875
Here, you're somebody.

57:00.040 --> 57:01.519
All right, that's enough.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.751
You profited from thiS
like everybody else.

57:04.120 --> 57:05.678
Clean or dirty.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.753
So whatever I am, it's on you.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.551
Make sure She pays you back
for that.

57:26.720 --> 57:28.278
What?

57:33.120 --> 57:36.877
Ten years...
I lived here with him.

57:39.400 --> 57:41.038
But I was alone.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.348
Hey.

57:51.920 --> 57:53.876
You're not alone.

57:57.520 --> 57:59.112
Come here.

58:05.840 --> 58:08.070
Let's get you
out of this apartment.

58:08.960 --> 58:10.871
Okay.

58:34.080 --> 58:36.196
Oh, Iooky here, huh?

58:36.920 --> 58:38.956
How's a man like Sean Duffy
afford a car like that?

58:39.040 --> 58:40.155
Hmm?

58:48.000 --> 58:50.195
I never been in this position
before in my life.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.157
Well, we're happy to help.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.390
You're a credit
to the community.

58:54.480 --> 58:55.480
You done good.

58:56.040 --> 58:59.316
Payment's due on the first,
rain or Shine.

59:01.440 --> 59:02.668
It'S okay.

59:03.800 --> 59:05.950
You know, we're just getting
this loan thing going.

59:06.120 --> 59:07.758
People will take a mile,
if you let them.

59:07.920 --> 59:10.639
He's not taking anything.
He's an old man.

59:10.800 --> 59:12.358
Speaking of old ones,

59:12.440 --> 59:14.829
my mother-in-law
asked me for money.

59:15.400 --> 59:17.470
Wow. That iS nerve.
What are you gonna do?

59:17.640 --> 59:19.915
I'm gonna enjoy the look on
her face when I tell her no.

59:21.320 --> 59:22.320
MrS. Brennan?

59:22.480 --> 59:23.549
Yeah.

59:23.840 --> 59:25.910
Got those groceries
to your house.

59:26.120 --> 59:28.395
And just collected down
in the 303. Luciano's.

59:28.560 --> 59:30.118
They sent meatballs.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.918
Oh, uh, take them over
to my mother's.

59:37.560 --> 59:38.754
Colin's got a screw loose.

59:38.920 --> 59:40.512
So I'll tighten him up.

59:40.720 --> 59:41.755
I got to go.

59:41.920 --> 59:43.148
Hey, you know,

59:43.240 --> 59:44.776
Grady said that
he turned in his collections,

59:44.800 --> 59:46.199
but I didn't see them.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.555
Some expenses came up. Iusedit

59:48.960 --> 59:49.960
What expenses?

59:50.120 --> 59:51.758
Why are you fucking riding me?

59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.677
I don't need to Sit across
the table with you.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.637
You and me,
we're never gonna be friends.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.313
Still got to eat.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.198
Yeah. Which one are we going to?

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.316
Barutto's. Up ahead.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.592
Kevin ever tell you
about hiS girlfriend Marie?

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.751
That was a girl
with a head on her Shoulders.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.235
That why she broke up
with Kevin?

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.396
I see you for who you are.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.757
Your own people uptown
don't like you.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.349
I'm opening the door
for my own people.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.398
NiggerS are gonna
come flooding all in here.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.159
Just had to marry the right guy.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.959
He's Sleeping with her again.
Marie.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.236
Behind your back.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.439
They used to meet at
the Travel Inn every Thursday.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.194
Restaurant's just right there.
One door up.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.112
I hope you've had fun.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.316
'Cause when he gets home,
you're done.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.436
He's gonna throw your black aSS

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.398
out on the street
where it belongs.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.390
Cut the shit.
You gonna give me my money?

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.516
After you.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.356
It'S closed, you fucking idiot!

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.879
Restaurants are closed
on Mondays, you fucking idiot.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.188
Thank you for the food

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.077
of which we are about
to receive. Amen.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.196
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.837
You look pretty, Mama.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920
Oh.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.550
Pretty doesn't matter.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.151
It'S just a tool women can use.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.199
For what?

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.235
For whatever we want.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.992
What do you want?

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.077
I want that
when you're in charge,

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.231
and you're in charge someday,

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.096
that I'll know no one'll
ever meSS with you

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.792
because you're my kids.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.416
You see this shit?
Look at it. Look at this.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.396
You see how She's dressed?

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.096
All right, that woman
has a sugar daddy

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.120
or she's up to something.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.349
Ruby O'Carroll?

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.552
No Irishman would ever
give her the time of day.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.358
I've been hearing that
the FedS are back.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.676
Hey, what did Ritchie want?

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.555
Just condolences, that's all.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.275
Not exactly dressed
for a funeral.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.512
The bitch fell. I'm not sorry.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.716
What happened?

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.915
They're getting out tomorrow.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.792
The Westies.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.679
All that work,
the beating we took,

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.712
and they serve 16 months.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.031
They get out,
we nail them again.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.440
- Yeah.
- And again, and again.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.896
And their wives, too.
Every last one of them

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.035
- if we have to.
- Good.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.879
Okay, that's it.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.917
We are not gonna rest on this.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.758
We're gonna get them.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.136
Now, look, I'm gonna
get some coffee.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160
You want something?

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.470
Mmm-mmm. No. I'm okay.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.952
Okay.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.320
Dad!

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.752
Let's go.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.438
Here. I'll take your bag.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.598
Church van came by
and picked everything up.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.114
Come on. I ain't got all day.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.554
Fucking paying for that!

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.792
Businesses are cooperating.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.440
There's real opportunity there.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.908
We all got to get together.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.233
Get me and the guys
rolled back in.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.720
Yeah.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440
Of course.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:25.119
Yeah, I had
two fingers up his nostrils.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.599
And he just kinda...

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.951
Hey, there. Uh...

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.274
Kevin was just, uh, telling me
stories about being inside.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.791
Yeah, so I'm gonna go.
I got a lot of...

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.118
All right... Excuse me.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.398
Get up.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.549
Hmm.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.392
You look beautiful,
you know that?

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.360
You know what, I got some
business to take care of.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.678
I'll see you back at home, baby.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.718
What kinda business
you got to take care of?

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.998
How are your husbands
taking this?

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.112
Ah, Jimmy's good.
You know, supportive.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.669
I haven't seen Rob.
But I'm living with Gabriel.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.393
And I'm happy.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.560
Yeah.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:41.076
Well, you two are just living
the fairy-tale dream, huh?

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.910
- The hell's your problem?
- I got to go.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.868
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.995
What...

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.154
Where iS she going?

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.960
Hey, yeah, this is
Agent Martinez calling in.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.314
Badge number...

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.760
Couldn't you be
a normal motherfucker

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.279
and just ask for a divorce?

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.517
HaS there ever been anything
normal between us?

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.136
You thought marrying me
made you a rebel?

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.230
You think it was easy
marrying you?

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.873
IS that what you think?

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.200
With my ma and all her crazy...

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.470
I think you never fucked
a black girl before

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.437
and I rocked your world.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.878
Yeah, yeah, I think it...
How many times?

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.376
Yeah, I think it was
only three timeS.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.400
Three times?

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.674
Yeah.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.359
Three times I came for real.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.520
IS that so?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.318
The rest was just show.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.600
You know,
this tough-girl bullshit,

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.198
it don't work on me.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.635
Did you forget I Spit on your
father's grave with you?

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.432
I've been inside you, Ruby.
I know you. I know your fear.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.192
You don't know shit.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.393
The only thing black people
need is power.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.993
That way no one
can fuck with you.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.439
And along comes this white boy
that'S so dumb,

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.988
he doesn't realize that he's
Sitting on top of an empire

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.310
if he'd get out his own way.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.352
You know what?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.868
You can keep the apartment.
I don't even need it.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.394
You got to stay the fuck
outta my way.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.189
Step off my business.

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:53.595
Baby... it's my business now.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.035
You fucking whore.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.240
Get out.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.078
You fucking that fucking psycho?

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.555
Rob, I swear. Get out.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.631
What happened here, huh?

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.756
'Cause I go away
and everything's fine.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.678
No. It was never fine.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.399
I never fucked around.
The other guys. Not me.

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.470
Not me. I'm good.
I'm a good person.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.993
You are a piece of Shit.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.911
And I am done with you.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.799
Yeah, well, you don't
get to say we're done!

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.756
You know what?

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.515
I never loved you.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:37.078
And I only married you
because I had to.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.198
Go ahead.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.712
Do it again.
You know you want to.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.073
You watch.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.834
How many times do you think
you hit me, huh?

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.191
Even when you killed our baby...

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.868
you couldn't stop.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.510
Go ahead.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.158
Do it again, you fuck.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.798
You're a fucking cunt.

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.873
What the fuck?

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.753
What did you do?

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.398
Who waS that?

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.553
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.792
Oh, my God.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.477
Was that Rob?

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.517
It waS him or me.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.120
It waS him or me, Kathy.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.230
Kathy... you're not in charge.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.953
Get in.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.833
I thought you ladies Should know

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.753
that there's a contract out
on each of you.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.278
Who put the hit out on us?

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.432
Her husband, Kevin.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.557
Uh, me and my boys was in a bar,

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.755
looking at some titties.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.428
You know? And this guy we done
some business with...

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.473
he asked me.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.275
Yeah, asked you what?

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.513
Well, to kill you.

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.079
What's his name?

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.753
Something Irish.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.673
Ah... They all sound the same.
DoDom

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.717
or Doo-Doo...

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.872
Duffy.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.913
No. No, he's my cousin.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.991
He knows that we are
in business with you.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.599
He's not gonna up and go

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.398
ask some Italian
to put a hit on us.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.357
Oh, I'm Greek.
On my mother's Side.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.478
He's not
an active associate of ours.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.589
How much they offer to pay?

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.751
Twenty-five grand
for each of you.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.439
That'S 75.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.592
We'll give you 100
for Duffy, Burns, and Colin.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.916
No. No. Colin iSjust a kid.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.798
He's with them, Kathy.
You know that.

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.075
You don't know that.

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.750
You clean up our crew.
For three of them, 100 grand.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.154
That'S a better deal.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.915
Plus, another 100 grand.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.833
Fifty grand for my husband.
And another 50 for hers.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.920
No.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.355
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, okay?

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.795
Jimmy'S got nothing to do
with this.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.188
Nothing.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.073
Stay away...

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.431
Stay away from him.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.549
Have you heard anything
about Jimmy?

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:13.114
You go to war...
there's no coming back.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.629
We pay you for protection,
not advice.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.637
Get in.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.359
Fuck you, Ruby!

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.429
Just got a bad feeling,
you know?

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.520
About Kathy and Ruby.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.872
And Kathy...

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.270
She didn't even wanna
make this move.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.510
She said Jimmy's not involved.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.352
She said
that kid Colin's not involved.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.033
- Kathy said that?
- Yeah.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.235
Fuck.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.709
She said he was 19.
We Should leave him alone.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.710
Said Jimmy's on our side.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.115
Hey.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.872
Look at me.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.789
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.438
We got this.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.755
What do we got?

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.556
We got whatever you want.
What do you want?

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.914
- You want the world?
- Yeah.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.513
Oh, shit.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.153
Well, we could go out
and get it, you know?

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.515
I already got you a palace.

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:30.114
Right? So, you're welcome.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.039
What else do you want?

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.952
We're doing pretty good.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.509
Yeah.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.631
Some messy stuff, right, but...

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.995
Yeah, but I'm good
at the messy stuff.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.593
- Yes, you are.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.550
I've seen that.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.936
- You're very good.
- Very good at it.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.076
- Terrifying.
- Very good at it.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.640
We're doing so good.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:56.949
Yeah.

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.990
Maybe we should try
and have a kid.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.358
Or something.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.312
Oh, no, no, no, wait, what?

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.277
You wanna have a kid with me?

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.754
- No.
- Yeah, you do.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.154
That'S what you said. Uh-uh.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.936
- No, I didn't say that...
- No, you can't take it back.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.616
- I said something else.
- No, that'S what you said.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.312
- I didn't say anything.
- YeS.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.256
Why'd you do this, Kath?
What'd you do to US?

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.396
No, no! No, you left us.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.549
They would've gone hungry

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.696
iflhadnt have done something.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.073
Stop it.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.874
Stop it!

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.359
- Duffy!
- Yeah?

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.118
Oh...

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.199
Colin, let'S go!

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.268
Motherfucker didn't even
change the locks after I left.

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.195
Five hundred more,
you clean it up?

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.318
Clean-up's on the house.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.158
Thank you.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.240
Jimmy. Jimmy!

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.560
Sal.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.835
Hey, Mrs. Brennan.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.515
I got you all night.
You're good.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.437
- ThankS.
- Yeah.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.159
Hey.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.554
Oh, fuck.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.155
Oh, you got him.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.594
Yeah.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.113
Fuck.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.918
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.757
What?

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.472
It'S Colin.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.116
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! No!

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.468
Claire.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:12.480
Oh, Christ. Claire?

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:17.473
Oh, fuck, stop... Claire.
Claire. Claire.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.392
Claire...

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.671
Come on. Come on.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:28.077
Stop it. Fuck! Stop.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.549
No, no, not...

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.856
Into your hands, O Lord,

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.519
we humbly entrust
our sister, Claire.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.036
In this life you embraced her
with your tender love.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.160
Deliver her now from every evil.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.073
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.591
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.238
on Earth as it iS in Heaven.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.675
Give us this day
our daily bread...

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.075
and forgive us our trespasseS

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.312
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.152
And lead us not into temptation,

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.912
but deliver us from evil.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.560
In the name of the Father,
the Son...

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.398
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.192
Amen.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.876
I'm so sorry for your loss.
We're here for you.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.311
Just give me a minute.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.296
I didn't know
Colin was capable of...

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.959
You protected
that piece of Shit.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.040
Well, the question we need
to ask ourselves is...

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.316
Are we behaving
according to the way

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.709
that society
expects us to behave...

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.150
and is that behavior
necessarily good for us...

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.601
Ruby and I got some business
over in the Jewelry District.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.074
No fucking way. Mmm-mmm.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.952
Claire iS dead.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.149
I know that.

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.669
Rob. Kevin.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.870
Everyone is dead, Kathy.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.429
It'S over now,
so we got to get back to it.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.591
You're not getting back
to anything.

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.960
You're out of this. You're done.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.399
- No.
- "NO"?

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.475
This is my business.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.868
Oh, come on, now.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.553
I made thiS.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.195
I built something
fucking amazing, Jimmy.

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.952
I'm putting people to work.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.336
I'm doing good things
in the community.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.960
I'm supposed to walk away
from that? Why?

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.112
Because you've decided that
I can't handle the pressure.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.160
That's not for you to decide.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.999
I was patient with all this.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.275
With you.

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.400
Oh, you were patient?
Like you allowed me a hobby?

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.873
You girls, you're way worse

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.360
than we ever were.
You're way worse.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.232
What do you expect me to do?

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.153
You expect me to stay at home
and watch the kids...

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.038
while you're out
playing mobster?

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.918
It'S fucking bullshit.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.957
The kids are outta school
in an hour!

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:35.352
I have been wiping their asses
Since day fucking one!

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.397
I know
when they get outta school.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.400
You want this one?

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.675
No. I got
too many like that already.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.353
Listen, if thiS thing's
gonna work,

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.759
it's got to be me and you,
50-50.

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.576
How's that different than
what we've been doing?

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.318
'Cause you're making decisions
on your own.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.072
You're not consulting me.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.153
And we can't go around killing
everybody that pisses you off.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.550
I got a meeting.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.277
- A meeting where?
- Harlem.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.953
What are we gonna do in Harlem?

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.076
Oh, we'll be fine in Harlem.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.908
You want a ride?

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.836
Oh, my God.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.238
You set them up.

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.516
You knew they were gonna hit
that store, didn't you?

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.954
Now call, call.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.520
This is Agent Martinez...

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.556
[made sure
no one got in the way.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.550
A black girl can't make a move
in the Kitchen.

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.359
I needed an Irish girl
to lead the way.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.635
Up to a point at least.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.920
You're the smarter one here.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.236
You sent Jimmy to prison.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.560
FBI! On your knees!

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.795
Get the fuck on your knees!

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.096
Guess I know
where the money's gone.

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.633
You paid him off.

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.476
I made an arrangement so that
we can get to where we wanted.

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.511
What's your arrangement now?

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.233
He's cool.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.038
I keep the gravy train rolling,

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.680
and we get everything
we ever wanted.

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.836
I meant us.
What is our arrangement?

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.598
You like what we built?

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.958
I didn't build this.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.475
Good. I'll take it from here.

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.836
Mmm-mmm. Hey, handsome.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.554
Hey.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.755
Mrs. Morris,

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.075
are Peter and Jennifer
still in the building?

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.193
They got picked up early.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.793
Both your kids got called down

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.075
to the principal'S office
around 2.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400
Uh, do you want me to...

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.976
Should I call the...

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.309
Should I call the police,
Mrs. Brennan?

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.594
Hello? Hello?

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Hello.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.435
Mrs. Brennan. Alfonso Coretti.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.591
I need you to make a trip
to Brooklyn. Now.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.832
Mr. Coretti, I can't do that.
I can't find my children.

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.235
[have your kids, Kathy.

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:35.520
They're safe.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.717
I promise. I'm a father, myself.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.232
Come to Brooklyn.

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.520
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.392
Oh, my God.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:54.792
Hey, hi. Hi.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.308
Hi. Hi.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.397
- Hi.
- What happened?

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.831
They F us every time.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.509
Every chance they get, dontthey?

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.515
Who F's us?

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.477
Ma, I know what F means.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.311
They're waiting for you
in the back.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.153
Go.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.033
Go.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.517
I got your kidS.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.552
I got them.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.634
Yeah.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.670
Start from the melody part.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.074
Baby, I didn't mean
to make any trouble.

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.232
What's going on?

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.472
Your husband, he came to me
and tried to make a deal.

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.197
What kind of deal?

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.430
To cut you out.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:15.758
You brought the kidS?

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:26.031
You brought our children to
a fucking meeting in Brooklyn?

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:30.274
I think he thought
it would insulate him.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.198
That I wouldn't do
nothing to a man

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.191
in front of hiS own children.

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.316
You don't know thiS man.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.629
You don't know that he wasn't
gonna kill them.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:01.469
Getting outta the joint...

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.000
to see you all dolled up.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.433
You're queen of the Micks.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.275
You said you were proud of me.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.948
You didn't make a place for me.

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.508
It'S fucking humiliating.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:31.517
You put your ego
before our children's safety.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.910
Before our
fucking children's safety!

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.799
How am I supposed
to trust you again, huh?

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.152
After this?

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.914
In this business, a man
is only as good as his word.

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.548
If I go behind your back,
how does that look?

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.880
I got a deal with you, Kathy.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.158
Not with him.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.910
Him... I don't have any use for.

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.593
Me, neither.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.600
Kathy.

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.755
Kathy!

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.792
Kathy!

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:14.910
I'm so sorry, Kathy.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.712
Are the kids okay?

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.710
Yeah, your mother has them
downstairs in the office.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.992
Eating snacks.
But, well, you know...

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.716
I know what you did.

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:47.916
I don't know...
What do you mean?

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.994
Kathy, it's a small town.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.238
I'm proud of you.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:56.994
I mean, I never understood it

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.389
when it was just you
being nutso, you know.

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:02.918
Taking risks for what?
For money.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.592
But your kids?

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.633
That'S right.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:13.029
That'S the right move,
you putting your kidS first.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.350
I would've done the same thing.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:21.279
I didn't put them first.
I did this for me.

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:27.519
Living all these years,
just thanking people.

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:32.318
Thanking you. Thanking
some man holding the door.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:35.159
Thanking a priest
for his blessings.

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:38.156
Thanking Jimmy.

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.875
Thanking God.

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.470
And with all that, I never
walked a day on the streets

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.631
without fear.

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.996
I never felt safe.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.037
No woman doeS.

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.559
Now I do.

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.191
I put me first.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.515
And this isn't gonna stop.
This is who I am.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.720
Times change.

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.597
You do what you got to do.

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:25.277
Famine. Violence.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.553
You survive.

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.920
You gonna point out
how wrong I was?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.035
Over Claire?

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.550
Or you giving me shit
about killing my husband?

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.352
It'S either gonna be all right
between us, or it's not.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.078
We got an issue
with the deli over on 34th.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.838
Haven't contributed in months.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.278
I'm gonna go pay them a visit.

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:11.199
This conversation isn't good
for either of us.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.113
I'll meet you on 34th
in an hour.

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.478
Hello?

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.072
Back here.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.429
Why don't you come out here?

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.230
I loved her, too.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.756
I loved her more.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.668
Fuck.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.435
I only came back for her.

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.078
I know.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.877
Okay.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.914
I'm not begging in front
of your whole family.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.591
I came here
to make you an offer.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.559
I don't trust you.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.199
Well, what do you need me for?

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.360
Why don't you go ahead

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:17.078
and just Shoot me right now,
right here?

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.240
Yeah, and then what?

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.072
Somebody comes along
and killS me?

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.470
We worked hard for this.

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.033
Okay, we built something good.

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.633
Do you wanna go back
to how it was?

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.119
You have no idea
what it's like to be me.

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.592
I'd rather die than go back.

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:32.720
Good.

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.314
'Cause we almost got
Midtown locked down.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.639
Can you imagine what we can do
if we go uptown?

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.756
You uptown?

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:42.999
They'd eat your ass alive.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.388
Yeah, I'd like to see you try

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.550
to run Hell's Kitchen
without me.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.358
Call them off.

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.630
Do we have an understanding?

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.834
Any of you need
to talk this Shit through?

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.080
Then get the fuck
out of our way.
