Captioning funded by CBS
>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER":

00:06.006 --> 00:09.977
CHRISTMAS WAS OFFERED THE RING
OF REPLACEMENT IN THE DEN OF

00:10.010 --> 00:12.480
>> "ACCEPT THIS TEMPTATION AND
THE RING OF REPLACEMENT WILL LET

00:12.513 --> 00:15.683
YOU PLAY IN ANY ONE VETO
COMPETITION YOU CHOOSE THIS

00:15.716 --> 00:16.850
SUMMER.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.819
THAT MEANS YOU MAY CHOOSE ONE
HOUSEGUEST THAT YOU WANT TO

00:18.852 --> 00:22.856
REPLACE FROM THE PLAYERS
SELECTED BY RANDOM DRAW."

00:22.890 --> 00:26.460
>> AND SHE GLADLY ACCEPTED HER
NEWBLING.

00:26.494 --> 00:30.064
>> I CHOOSE TO ACCEPT THIS
TEMPTATION.

00:30.098 --> 00:33.634
>> WITH THE MEATBALL RUNNING THE
SHOW --

00:33.667 --> 00:34.402
>> CONGRATULATIONS, JOSH!

00:34.435 --> 00:38.306
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

00:38.339 --> 00:39.507
.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.610
>> PAUL WANTED HIM TO CONTINUE
TO TARGET JODI.

00:42.643 --> 00:47.415
>> IF I TELL YOU CERTAIN THINGS,
LISTEN TO ME, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT

00:47.448 --> 00:49.383
GOING TO SUGGEST ANYTHING CRAZY
TO YOU.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.420
>> BUT JOSH WAS EYEING ELENA
INSTEAD.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.356
>> DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD COME
DOWN TO YOU AND MARK.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.025
IF IT WAS THAT EASY FOR TO YOU
VOTE ME OUT, MAYBE IT WILL BE

00:58.058 --> 01:00.461
EASY FOR ME TO PUT YOU ON THE
BLOCK.

01:00.494 --> 01:05.099
>> PAUL TRIED TO SWAY JOSH BACK
TO JESS AND CODY.

01:05.133 --> 01:08.802
>> I WANT US ALL TO PLAY NICE
WITH JESS BECAUSE SHE NEEDS TO

01:08.836 --> 01:09.937
GO FIRST.

01:09.970 --> 01:14.575
>> SO CHRISTMAS WARNED JOSH NOT
TO LET PAUL CONTROL HIM.

01:14.608 --> 01:18.712
>> THIS IS JOSH'S H.O.H., SO I
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT JOSH

01:18.746 --> 01:26.787
IS LOOKED OUT FOR AND THAT, THAT
BIG OLD MEATBALL DOESN'T GET

01:26.820 --> 01:27.855
RAILROADED.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.357
>> AT THE TEMPTATION
COMPETITION, JODI HAD A PLAN TO

01:29.390 --> 01:31.692
KEEP THEM BOTH SAFE FOR THE
WEEK.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.928
>> BEST CASE, ONE OF US WINS AND
IS SAFE FOR THE WEEK, AND ONE OF

01:34.962 --> 01:38.031
US LOSES AND BECOMING THE THIRD
NOMINEE, WE CAN PLAY IN VETO.

01:38.065 --> 01:42.102
>> FIRST, JESSICA THREW IT TO
GUARANTEE A SPOT IN THE VETO.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.104
>> I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.839
CAN I JUST FORFEIT?

01:45.873 --> 01:48.809
NO I HAVE TO HOPE THAT CODY WINS
SO HE'S SAFE THIS WEEK.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.512
>> THEN CODY SCARED UP SOME
SAFETY FOR HIMSELF.

01:51.545 --> 01:55.249
>> CODY, THAT MEANS YOU'RE SAFE
FOR THE WEEK, AND, JESS, YOU'RE

01:55.283 --> 01:56.850
THE THIRD NOMINEE.

01:56.884 --> 01:57.885
CONGRATULATIONS, CODY.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.120
>> MYSELF AND JESSICA EXECUTED
THE PLAN PERFECTLY.

02:00.154 --> 02:04.258
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WIN
VETO, AND ME AND JESSICA CAN

02:04.292 --> 02:05.659
STICK AROUND TO FIGHT ANOTHER
WEEK.

02:05.693 --> 02:11.765
>> WITH JODI NO LONGER OPTIONS,
JOSH SET HIS SIGHTS ON ELENA.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.336
>> YOU JUST TELL THEM THEY'RE
PAWNS AND JESSICA IS THE TARGET.

02:15.369 --> 02:19.340
>> WE'LL TELL HER LATER SHE'S
THE PAWN, BUT LITTLE DOES SHE

02:19.373 --> 02:22.543
KNOW SHE'S MY TARGET AND THERE'S
NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.279
>> AFTER PAUL FILLED IN ELENA...

02:25.313 --> 02:27.181
SHE CONFRONTED THE MATTE BALL.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.317
>> I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I TOLD
YOU RIGHT NOW.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.485
YOU DID NOT ASK ME FOR
SUGGESTIONS.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.321
>> IF YOU'RE GOING TO LIE, I
CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.323
YOU'RE GOING UP AS A PAWN.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.226
>> AT THE NOMINATION CEREMONY...

02:38.259 --> 02:41.329
>> I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, MARK,
AND YOU, ELENA.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.998
>> ...JOSH TRIED TO HIDE HIS
TRUE TARGET BY GOING AFTER JESS.

02:45.032 --> 02:48.269
>> YOU DECIDED TO PLAY JODI'S
GAME AND TAKE A SHOT AT ME.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.339
NOW I'M OUT FOR REVENGE, AND I
THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I'M

02:51.372 --> 02:51.739
GUNNING FOR YOU.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.906
>> OH, MY GOD.

02:52.940 --> 02:57.345
>> TONIGHT, WILL THE POWER OF
VETO SAVE JESSICA, MARK, OR

02:57.378 --> 02:58.178
ELENA?

02:58.212 --> 03:02.216
PLUS, WHAT BRINGS THE MARINE TO
TEARS?

03:02.250 --> 03:06.954
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER."

03:06.987 --> 03:08.622
>> OOOHH!

03:08.656 --> 03:12.426
OH, MY-- THAT IS NOT FUNNY!

03:16.129 --> 03:24.838
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMO CEREMO
ADJOURNED.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.575
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT I'M
TARGETING JESS BECAUSE CODY'S

03:27.608 --> 03:31.712
SAFE FOR THE WEEK, BUT LITTLE DO
THEY KNOW, THAT I WANT ELENA OUT

03:31.745 --> 03:34.548
AS BAD AS I WANT JESS AND CODY
OUT.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.217
ELENA HAS BEEN PLAYING THE
MIDDLE AND ACTING LIKE SHE'S

03:37.251 --> 03:40.220
EVERYBODY'S FRIENDS AND SHE'S
PLAYING IS REAL GOOD AND THAT'S

03:40.254 --> 03:49.863
ONE SHADY, DISLOYAL PERSON I
WON'T WANT IN.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.632
>> THAT'S OKAY.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.800
I'M A SURVIVOR.

03:52.833 --> 03:56.003
EVEN THOUGH JESSICA IS THE
TARGET AND I'M A PAWN, BEING ON

03:56.036 --> 03:58.639
THE BLOCK IS NOT WHAT I CONSIDER
SAFE!

03:58.672 --> 04:03.377
IF JESSICA WINS THIS VETO AND
COMES OFF THE BLOCK, THERE'S

04:03.411 --> 04:04.412
NIGHT REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.914
ME AND MARK ARE GOING HOME.

04:06.947 --> 04:07.548
THAT'S SCARY.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.782
DO NOT LIKE.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.452
>> BEING UP ON THE BLOCK NEXT TO
ELENA SUCTION, BUT AT THE SAME

04:11.485 --> 04:15.423
TIME, I AM UP NEXT TO JESSICA.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.459
WHOIS A HUGE TARGET THIS WEEK,
SO HOPEFULLY THE HOUSE WANTS

04:18.492 --> 04:21.862
HOAR OUT BUT I NEED TO WIN THIS
VETO BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY WAY TO

04:21.895 --> 04:24.197
MAKE SURE I'M STILL HERE AT THE
END OF THIS WEEK.

04:24.231 --> 04:27.835
>> BEING ON THE BLOCK ALWAYS
SUCKS, BUT I THREW THE

04:27.868 --> 04:30.704
TEMPTATION COMPETITION TO ENSURE
THEY WOULD NOT BE BACKDORRED,

04:30.738 --> 04:34.942
AND NOW I CAN JUST GO INTO VETO
AND GIVE IT EVERYTHING THAT I'VE

04:34.975 --> 04:38.746
GOT.

04:38.779 --> 04:44.585
>> GUYS, ALL I'M SAYING IS--
ALL--

04:44.618 --> 04:45.719
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

04:45.753 --> 04:50.123
>> ALL I'M SAYING IS, SHE'S
GOING TO START... THIS WHOLE

04:50.157 --> 04:56.096
WEEK WITH ME.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.887
>> HOW IS IT GOING, DOLL FACE?

05:19.920 --> 05:20.854
YOU FEELING OKAY AFTER THAT?

05:20.888 --> 05:21.755
>> I'M FEELING OKAY.

05:21.789 --> 05:22.623
>> YEAH?

05:22.656 --> 05:22.956
YOU'RE GOOD?

05:22.990 --> 05:23.457
>> YEAH.

05:23.491 --> 05:26.226
>> THAT'S GOOD.

05:26.259 --> 05:32.165
>> IF YOU GUYS WANT TO TALK--
>> TALK ABOUT WHAT?

05:32.199 --> 05:35.503
>> I WANT TO TALK TO JESSICA TO
HINT TO HER WITHOUT SAYING TOO

05:35.536 --> 05:37.270
MUCH THAT SHE'S NOT MY TARGET
THIS WEEK.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.207
SHE'S THE HOUSE'S TARGET, BUT
I'M GUNNING FOR ELENA.

05:40.240 --> 05:40.941
I'M NOT ARGUING.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.109
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:42.142 --> 05:45.513
>> I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE,
CURSE, OR BE DISRESPECTFUL.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.647
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:46.680 --> 05:47.681
WE'RE NOT ARGUING.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.516
WE'RE NOT CURSING.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.984
AND I'M NOT BEING DISRESPECTFUL.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.152
>> I CAN SIT DOWN AND TALK?

05:52.185 --> 05:56.624
>> YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,
JOSH, YOU'RE A GROWN MAN.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.892
I CAN'T TAKE THE BACK-AND-FORTH.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.761
YOU NEED TO PICK A MOOD AND STAY
THERE.

06:00.794 --> 06:01.695
>> OKAY.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.964
>> THIS BACK-AND-FORTH, JUST SAY
CONSISTENT.

06:03.997 --> 06:04.965
>> OKAY.

06:04.998 --> 06:05.966
>> CAN I TALK NOW?

06:05.999 --> 06:06.667
>> GO FOR IT.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.469
>> I SAID THINGS ABOUT YOU GUYS.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.303
YOU GUYS SAID THINGS ABOUT ME.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.672
>> SO YOU WANT THE FINAL SAY.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.106
>> NO, THIS IS A GAME.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.175
AND WE'RE PLAYING THE GAME.

06:15.208 --> 06:15.709
RIGHT?

06:15.743 --> 06:16.844
>> SPIT IT OUT, JOSH.

06:16.877 --> 06:21.248
>> I BELIEVE THAT YOUR-- THAT
CODY HAS RUINED YOUR GAME.

06:21.281 --> 06:25.653
THAT'S MY STANDPOINT.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.754
>> THAT'S MY OPINION.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.423
BUT I'M NOT DISRESPECTING YOU.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.491
I'M JUST STATING MY OPINION.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.494
>> JOSH, WE NEVER ASKED FOR YOUR
OPINION.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.929
JOSH, BETWEEN ME AND YOU,
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.931
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK
ANYMORE.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.000
>> YOU LITERALLY TOOK THE WORDS
OUT OF MY MOUTH.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.201
>> THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.

06:41.234 --> 06:45.205
>> BUT I WANTED TO STATE ALSO,
THAT YOU TWO ARE TWO SEPARATE

06:45.238 --> 06:46.306
PEOPLE.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.308
>> SEE, NOW, YOU'RE-- YOU'RE NOT
SEEING THE POINT HEIR.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.243
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING
ELSE FROM YOU, OKAY?

06:50.277 --> 06:51.979
>> ALL RIGHT, DEAL.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.047
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS
PERSONAL.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.182
YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE
YOURSELF--

06:55.215 --> 06:55.949
>> I KNOW THAT.

06:55.983 --> 06:59.920
>> SO THEN... YOU STILL HAVE
VETO.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.789
YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO PULL
YOURSELF OFF.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.524
YOU WIN NEXT WEEK, I RESPECT
YOUR DECISION.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.625
>> I'M FINE, JOSH.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.894
THIS GAME-- I'VE BEEN THROUGH
EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.898
AND ONE MORE SPEECH, TWO MORE
SPEECHES, THREE MORE SPEECHES,

07:10.931 --> 07:13.934
THROW THEM AT ME, BECAUSE I CAN
TAKE THEM EVERY SINGLE TIME.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.070
>> I DON'T VALLEY A PROBLEM WITH
JESSICA.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.707
MY PROBLEM IS WITH CODY, BUT
SHE'S STANDING BY HER MAN AND

07:19.740 --> 07:20.841
SHE'S MAKING IT PERSONAL.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.976
I WISH I COULD MAKE HER
UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT MY TARGET

07:23.010 --> 07:25.378
THIS WEEK SO FOCUS AND GUN FOR
THE VETO.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.247
WHEN YOU CALM DOWN, ZEAL A
CONVERSATION.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.316
>> I'M CALM.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.083
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.385
>> I PROMISE YOU, THIS IS CALM.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.321
>> I THINK JOSH IS AN IDIOT.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.590
NOTHING HE SAYS MAKES SENSE.

07:36.624 --> 07:40.828
I WOULD RATHER SHAVE MY HEAD
THAN CONTINUE TALKING TO HIM.

07:40.861 --> 07:45.132
>> WHEN YOU CALM DOWN, I PROMISE
YOU, WE WILL HAVE A

07:45.165 --> 07:45.499
CONVERSATION.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.435
>> I'M FINE.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.081
>> FOR NOW, YEAH.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.251
>> A FEW WEEKS AGO, CHRISTMAS
TOLD ME THE TEMPTATION THAT SHE

08:04.284 --> 08:05.553
GOT FROM AMERICA.

08:05.586 --> 08:09.757
>> I WAS VOTED TO GET THE
TEMPTATION.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.257
>> YEAH?

08:10.290 --> 08:10.824
>> YOU KNOW THAT.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.459
>> I DIDN'T.

08:12.492 --> 08:18.031
>> NOT INCLUDING THE H.O.H. AND
NOMINATIONS, I CAN SWITCH OUT

08:18.065 --> 08:19.900
MYSELF TO PLAY FOR VETO.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.002
>> THAT'S PERFECT.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.871
BUT WHAT-- DID YOU REMEMBER HOW
LONG?

08:23.904 --> 08:28.576
>> I TONIGHT THINK THAT IT HAD
AN EXPIRATION.

08:28.609 --> 08:32.179
IN THE SECOND DEN OF TEMPTATION,
AMERICA GRANTED ME THE RING OF

08:32.212 --> 08:37.217
REPLACEMENT, WHICH ALLOWS ME TO
TAKE THE PLACE OF ANY RANDOMLY

08:37.250 --> 08:38.852
SELECTED HIEWGHT PICKED TO PLAY
FOR THE COMPETITION.

08:38.886 --> 08:39.653
>> I HAVE A GOOD PLAN.

08:39.687 --> 08:40.921
>> LET ME KNOW YOUR PLAN.

08:40.954 --> 08:46.026
>> WHEN VETO COMES, CODY GETS
PULLED TO PLAY, YOU SWAP.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.461
WHAT'S UP, BITCHES.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.497
HE NO LONGER CAN PLAY.

08:50.530 --> 08:54.467
JESSICA PLAYS ALONE.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.569
IT'S FIVE "V" 1.

08:55.603 --> 08:58.505
THIS IS A PERFECT TIME TO USE
THE TEMPTATION.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.274
"A," JESSICA IS ON THE THE
BLOCK.

09:01.308 --> 09:05.045
"B," WE DON'T WANT CODE TOW PLAY
AND SAVE HIMSELF AND PULL HER

09:05.078 --> 09:06.146
OFF.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.347
AND AS MUCH ASIVE TRUST
CHRISTMAS JOY I DON'T WANT HER

09:07.380 --> 09:10.083
TO HAVE THIS TRICK UP HER SLEEVE
LATER ON IN THE GAME WHEN IT

09:10.117 --> 09:11.652
MIGHT NOT BE TO MY BENEFIT.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.552
>> I DON'T KNOW.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.121
I THINK IT MIGHT BE EARLY FOR ME
TO USE IT.

09:14.154 --> 09:18.726
>> I KNOW, BUT YOU DON'T WANT
CODE TOW PLAY BECAUSE CODY IS A

09:18.759 --> 09:19.627
GOOD COMPETITOR.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.561
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

09:21.595 --> 09:21.962
PLEASE?

09:21.995 --> 09:22.462
>> GOOD NIGHT.

09:22.495 --> 09:29.569
>> SEE YOU TOMORROW.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.077
>> OKAY.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.446
>> PAUL OBVIOUSLY WANTS JESS
OUT.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.149
BUT THIS IS NOT PAUL'S H.O.H.

09:42.182 --> 09:46.019
I WANT TO TELL JOSH ABOUT MY
RING OF REPLACEMENT BECAUSE IT'S

09:46.053 --> 09:48.488
A HUGE TRUST MOVE, AND WE CAN
COLLABORATE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO

09:48.521 --> 09:49.522
USE IT.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.092
OKAY, SO YOU KNOW THAT I GOT
AMERICA'S VOTE, RIGHT?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.027
>> YEAH, WAIT.

09:54.061 --> 09:54.895
>> WEEK TWO.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.064
>> I KNEW IT!

09:57.097 --> 09:58.198
I KNEW IT!

09:58.231 --> 09:59.332
I KNEW IT!

09:59.366 --> 09:59.967
WHAT WAS IT?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.168
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IT WAS?

10:01.201 --> 10:06.406
>> DURING THE VETO PICKS, IT'S A
REPLACEMENT RING.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.574
>> OKAY.

10:07.607 --> 10:12.079
>> ANYBODY WHO ELSE IS PICKED, I
CAN REPLACE MYSELF WITH TO

10:12.112 --> 10:12.980
COMPETE INSTEAD OF THEM.

10:13.013 --> 10:13.480
>> OKAY.

10:13.513 --> 10:14.481
>> PAUL KNOWS.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.984
SO IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.553
BUT PAUL WAS, LIKE, "IF CODY
GETS PICKED, THEN YOU CAN SWITCH

10:20.587 --> 10:22.589
IT OUT."

10:22.622 --> 10:24.024
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

10:24.057 --> 10:33.100
>> I'LL SUPPORT YOU WHATEVER YOU
DECIDE TO DO.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.335
>> I EXECUTED PERFECTLY TODAY.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.170
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL
DOWN YET.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.538
>> I'M JUST STRESSED.

10:38.571 --> 10:42.743
>> DON'T FEEL STRESSED YET.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.411
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

10:44.444 --> 10:47.848
>> VETO WILL COME, KNOCK IT OUT.

10:47.881 --> 10:48.849
>> I DON'T KNOW.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.884
I HAVE A BAD FEELING.

10:50.918 --> 10:54.221
>> I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN FLYING BY
THE SEAT OF OUR PANTS THIS WHOLE

10:54.254 --> 10:55.255
TIME.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.726
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT IN YOUR
COMPETITION ABILITIES,

10:58.759 --> 11:05.498
ESPECIALLY OVER MARK AND ELENA
AND JOSH.

11:05.532 --> 11:08.301
>> PRAY YOUR NAME GETS PICKED
FOR THAT VETO COMP.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.071
ONLY TWO PEOPLE'S NAMES ARE
GOING TO BE DRAWN TO COMPETE,

11:11.104 --> 11:14.241
AND I AM JUST PRAYING THAT
CODY'S NAME IS ONE OF THEM.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.177
IF CODY WINS, HE'S THE ONLY
OTHER PERSON THEY TRUST TO PULL

11:17.210 --> 11:19.412
ME OFF.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.149
>> THIS IS A DO-OR-DIE RIGHT
NOW.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.050
>> IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

11:23.083 --> 11:26.219
>> NO, BUT THIS IS THE BIG ONE.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.255
>> YEAH.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.267
>> AND YEAH.

11:40.300 --> 11:44.604
FROM A GAME PERSPECTIVE, I WANT
THE HEX USED-- WHATEVER IT IS, I

11:44.637 --> 11:45.605
DON'T WANT THAT USED.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.473
>> OKAY.

11:46.506 --> 11:50.043
>> I DON'T CARE IF CODY GETS
PULLED OFF.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.979
>> IT MAKES SENSE TO USE IT
LATER.

11:52.012 --> 11:55.582
>> WHEN WE NEED IT.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.285
>> PAUL WANTS JESS OUT FOR HIS
GAME.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.920
>> BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR AGENDA.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.688
>> BUT THAT'S NOT MY AGENDA.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.923
>> RIGHT.

12:02.956 --> 12:07.260
>> BUT ELENA, I DON'T RESPECT
THE WAY SHE'S PLAYING THIS GAME.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.062
AND I WANT HER OUT MORE THAN
JESS.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.732
MY TARGET THIS WEEK IS ELENA, SO
IF CODY GETS DRAWN AND PULLS OFF

12:12.766 --> 12:16.970
JESS, IT ISN'T THAT BAD FOR MY
GAME, SO I SEE NO SENSE IN

12:17.004 --> 12:19.973
CHRISTMAS USING THE RING OF
REPLACEMENT THIS WEEK WHEN WE

12:20.007 --> 12:21.341
CAN USE IT LATER IN THE GAME.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.211
DO YOU WANT TO GO UP TO PAUL AND
SAY, "I DON'T WANT IT USED?"

12:24.244 --> 12:24.577
>> OKAY.

12:24.611 --> 12:31.751
>> LET'S GO.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.254
>> SONNY, WAKE UP.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.688
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.090
>> I'M LISTENING.

12:37.124 --> 12:37.925
WHAT'S UP?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.726
>> OKAY, THE POWER THAT
CHRISTMAS HAS.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.593
>> UH-HUH.

12:40.627 --> 12:44.131
>> I DON'T WANT IT TO BE USED
THIS WEEK.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.332
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

12:45.365 --> 12:50.470
>> I PERSONALLY THINK IF SHE
USES THUSES THAT IT MAKES OUR CH

12:50.503 --> 12:53.706
OF JESSICA GOING HOME THIS WEEK
HIGHER.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.709
I THINK SHE NEEDS TO GO BEFORE
ELENA.

12:56.743 --> 13:02.249
>> EVEN IF JESS DOES STAY, THE
WHOLE HOUSE, WE ALL WANT ONE OF

13:02.282 --> 13:03.516
THEM OUT.

13:03.550 --> 13:09.322
>> I THINK WHAT JOSH'S POINT IS
THAT CODY AND JESSICA ARE CLEAR

13:09.356 --> 13:10.523
TARGETS FOR THE HOUSE.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.826
>> AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I'M GUNNING FOR ELENA AT THIS

13:12.860 --> 13:13.626
POINT.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.794
>> JOSH, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
BUD!

13:14.828 --> 13:17.965
THAT ONE WEEK THAT JESSICA AND
CODY WERE SEPARATED, JESSICA

13:17.998 --> 13:19.432
COULD NOT DO ANYTHING.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.269
AND WHEN CODY IS ALONE HE'S
LOST.

13:22.302 --> 13:26.339
TOGETHER THEY'RE A POWER COUPLE
AND THEY STREAMROLL.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.842
HOW IS THAT NOT CLEAR TO YOU.

13:28.876 --> 13:32.379
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO NEEDS
TO GO FIRST, IT'S CLEAR AS FAR

13:32.412 --> 13:34.915
AS I THINK THAT JESSICA IS
STRONGER THAN ELENA.

13:34.948 --> 13:38.385
>> I WENT IN THIS WEEK, THINKING
JESSICA WAS GOING HOME, BUT

13:38.418 --> 13:40.888
ELENA STARTED DOING ALL THIS
LITTLE STUFF, MADE ME LOOK LIKE

13:40.921 --> 13:43.690
A LIAR, AND I DON'T TRUST HER.

13:43.723 --> 13:46.526
>> ALSO, THIS IS THE WEEK BEFORE
JURY.

13:46.559 --> 13:51.965
THEY'RE IN JURY TOGETHER,
THEY'RE MAKING THE SAME VOTE,

13:51.999 --> 13:52.599
100%.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.734
THAT'S  SCARY, DUDE.

13:54.767 --> 13:55.602
THAT'S TWO VOTES.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.404
SAY YOU WERE IN THE FINAL TWO.

13:57.437 --> 14:01.541
JESSICA AND CODY WOULD VOTE
AGAINST YOU OUT OF SPITE.

14:01.574 --> 14:06.546
BUT ELENA WOULD ACTUALLY, I
THINK, MAKE A FAIR DECISION.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.480
>> THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.216
>> YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.351
>> I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

14:11.384 --> 14:15.788
>> PAUL BRINGS UP A REALLY GOOD
POINT, IF JESS AND CODY ARE IN

14:15.822 --> 14:18.491
JURY TOGETHER, THOSE ARE TWO
VOTES AGAINST ME IN THE END.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.561
SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD USE
THE RING OF REPLACEMENT OR NOT.

14:21.594 --> 14:22.829
AT THIS POINT, I'M REALLY TORN.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.431
>> IT'S YOUR DECISION.

14:24.464 --> 14:29.102
BUT IF CODY IS DRAWN AND YOU
WANT ME TO USE IT, AT THAT TIME,

14:29.136 --> 14:30.971
LOOK AT ME AND BLINK HARD.

14:31.004 --> 14:31.571
>> YEAH.

14:31.604 --> 14:35.842
RU
>> HEY, EVERYONE!

14:44.551 --> 14:48.821
IT'S TIME TO PICK PLAYERS FOR
THE VETO COMPETITION!

14:48.855 --> 14:54.694
>> YAY!

14:54.727 --> 14:58.665
>> ONLY SIX PEOPLE WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE VETO

14:58.698 --> 15:00.367
COMPETITION: THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, THE THREE NOMINEES,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.635
AND TWO PLAYERS SELECTED BY
RANDOM DRAW.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.804
WILL THE NOMINEES PLEASE JOIN ME
UP HERE?

15:04.837 --> 15:09.943
>> I'M REALLY PRAYING THAT
CODY'S NAME GETS PICKED.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.679
IF ANYBODY WINS VETO BESIDES
HIM, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE

15:12.712 --> 15:13.780
ME OFF THE BLOCK.

15:13.813 --> 15:17.084
SO HE'S MY LAST HOPE.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.987
>> CODY'S NAME CANNOT BE DRAWN
BECAUSE PAUL AND CHRISTMAS ARE

15:20.020 --> 15:23.523
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ME TO
GIVE HER A SIGN TIEWZ THE RING

15:23.556 --> 15:26.626
OF REPLACEMENT, AND I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO MAKE THIS CALL JUST

15:26.659 --> 15:27.527
YET.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.795
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE RIGHT
TIME FOR IT.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.898
ALL RIGHT, AS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD,
WE WILL PULL TWO CHIPS OUT OF

15:31.931 --> 15:35.535
THE BOX TO DETERMINE THE OTHER
PLAYERS COMPETING IN THE VETO

15:35.568 --> 15:36.636
COMPETITION.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.738
IF I PULL THE CHIP OF EITHER
MYSELF OR ONE OF THE THREE

15:38.771 --> 15:41.208
NOMINEES, THAT PERSON WILL GET
TO CHOOSE THE PLAYER OF THEIR

15:41.241 --> 15:45.512
CHOICE.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.347
MARK.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.516
>> I CHOSE ALEX.

15:49.549 --> 15:53.120
I PICKED ALEX BECAUSE SHE CALLED

15:53.153 --> 15:55.755
ME OUT FOR PLAYING BOTH SIDES OF
THE HOUSE, BUT I WANT TO SHOW

15:55.788 --> 15:58.125
HER THAT I TRUST HER AND HER
SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND HOPEFULLY,

15:58.158 --> 16:08.501
AFTER THIS, WE CAN MOVE FORWARD
WORKING TOGETHER.

16:08.535 --> 16:20.747
>> CODY.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.982
>> WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

16:23.016 --> 16:27.220
OUR WHOLE WEEK COULD BE DICTATED
BY JOSH BLINKING AND CHRISTMAS

16:27.254 --> 16:28.621
USING THE TEMPTATION.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.292
JOSH, WHERE IS THE SIGNAL?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.562
WHERE'S THE CUE.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.663
SOMEBODY BLINK!

16:36.696 --> 16:37.364
HI!

16:37.397 --> 16:38.765
BLINK, BLINK, BLINK!

16:38.798 --> 16:40.800
JUST BLINK!

16:53.012 --> 16:56.416
>> WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW
PUMPED I AM TO BE ABLE TO PLAY

16:56.449 --> 16:59.018
IN THIS COMPETITION WITH
JESSICA.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.288
I'LL BREAK BONES TO WIN THIS
VETO COMPETITION.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.190
I DON'T CARE.

17:03.223 --> 17:06.793
>> CODY GETS PICKED, AND I STARE
AT JOSH, AND I'M LIKE, "DO YOU

17:06.826 --> 17:07.960
WANT ME TO USE THIS?

17:07.994 --> 17:10.763
LOOK AT ME, YOU MEATBALL."

17:10.797 --> 17:13.466
I'M ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT RIGHT
NOW READY FOR THIS RING.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.801
>> HELLO!

17:14.834 --> 17:15.635
CHRISTMAS!

17:15.668 --> 17:27.547
I THINK JOSH FORGOT HOW TO
BLINK, SO...

17:27.580 --> 17:36.589
>> MY TURN.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.900
>> OH, MY GOD!

17:47.934 --> 17:59.078
>> SON OF A...

18:03.616 --> 18:09.122
>> AMERICA HAS TEMPTED ME INSIDE
THE DEN OF TEMPTATION WITH THE

18:09.156 --> 18:10.357
RING OF REPLACEMENT.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.893
THIS RING GIVES ME THE POWER TO
REPLACE ANYONE OF THE PLAYERS

18:13.926 --> 18:18.598
SELECTED BY RANDOM DRAW WITH
MOI.

18:18.631 --> 18:23.002
I'VE DECIDED TO USE THE RING OF
REPLACEMENT NOW.

18:23.035 --> 18:33.079
AND I'M CHOOSING TO REPLACE CODY
IN TODAY'S VETO COMPETITION.

18:33.079 --> 18:42.355
AND I'M CHOOSING TO REPLACE CODY
IN TODAY'S VETO COMPETITION.

18:42.389 --> 18:47.794
>> BIG BROTHER WILL INFORM US

18:54.367 --> 18:56.169
WHEN THE COMPETITION IS TO
BEGIN.

18:56.203 --> 19:02.975
GOOD LUCK.

19:03.009 --> 19:06.213
I KNOW THAT THE HOUSE WANTS
JESSICA OUT BAD, AND IF CODY

19:06.246 --> 19:09.216
WOULD HAVE SAVED JESS AND PULLED
HER OFF THE BLOCK, THAT FALLS

19:09.249 --> 19:10.049
BACK ON ME.

19:10.082 --> 19:14.421
SO I END UP GIVING CHRISTMAS THE
BLINK.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.324
>> THAT WAS GANGSTERRESQUE.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.358
CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.294
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC FOR
MULTIPLE REASONS.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.130
"A," CODY DOESN'T GET TO PLAY
THE VETO.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.934
"B," OUR CHANCES OF WINNING AND
GETTING JESSICA OUT,

19:27.967 --> 19:28.901
EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.803
AND "C," ALL TEMPTATIONS HAVE
BEEN EXHAUSTED.

19:30.837 --> 19:37.710
I DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ANY
PENDANT, RINGS, COIN, HEXLETS,

19:37.744 --> 19:39.446
GOBLETS, FOR THE REST OF THIS
GAME.

19:39.479 --> 19:45.084
I'M STOKED.

20:18.017 --> 20:23.323
>> IT'S NOT OVER.

20:23.356 --> 20:33.633
>> YOU GOT TO WIN.

20:33.666 --> 20:42.975
* *
>> IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART THAT

20:43.009 --> 20:45.345
I CAN'T BE THERE FOR HER.

20:45.378 --> 20:48.915
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME, IT
DOESN'T MATTER.

20:48.948 --> 20:55.254
ANYTHING WITH JESSICA JUST
CRUSHES ME.

20:55.288 --> 20:59.559
>> IT'S ALWAYS US AGAINST THE
HOUSE.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.996
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.768
>> DO YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES?

21:08.801 --> 21:11.438
>> I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY
TO YOU, CHRISTMAS.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.273
>> JESSICA, I JUST WANT YOU TO
KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT PERSONAL.

21:14.307 --> 21:18.110
>> IT'S VERY PERSONAL TO ME
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY SAID A LOT OF

21:18.144 --> 21:21.381
VERY SINCERE, SWEET THINGS TO
YOU, AND YOU DECIDED TO USE YOUR

21:21.414 --> 21:23.182
GIFT TO TAKE ME OUT OF THIS
GAME.

21:23.215 --> 21:27.420
>> I WASN'T SURE FIREALLY WANTED
TO USE THE RING OF REPLACEMENT.

21:27.454 --> 21:31.090
HOWEVER, IN THE BEGINNING OF THE
GAME, CODY THREW ME UP ON THE

21:31.123 --> 21:34.494
BLOCK, BLINDSIDED ME, AND THIS
TIME I GET TO TAKE HIS POWER

21:34.527 --> 21:36.629
AWAY AND SO HE CAN'T SAVE HIS
GIRL.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.864
SO IT MIGHT BE A TAD PERSONAL.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.133
I TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHAT WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU USED THE

21:41.167 --> 21:41.568
THING.

21:41.601 --> 21:42.168
SO YOU USED IT.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.236
I LIKE YOU PERSONALLY.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.172
GAME-WISE, I THINK YOU NEED TO
UNDERSTAND HOW TO SEPARATE THE

21:46.205 --> 21:47.507
TWO.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.476
>> CHRISTMAS, YOU'RE STABBING ME
IN THE BACK.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.310
YOU CAN GO TO HELL.

21:51.344 --> 21:52.345
>> I UNDERSTAND IT.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.446
IT'S A GAME.

21:53.480 --> 21:58.485
>> I DON'T HAVE PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE WHO

21:58.518 --> 22:05.458
ARE TWO-FACED.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.832
>> CHRISTMAS CAME IN THE
BATHROOM AFTER SHE ASKED TO TALK

22:12.865 --> 22:14.300
TO ME AND I SAID NO.

22:14.333 --> 22:18.204
SHE WAS LIKE, "YOU NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO SEPARATE GAME AND

22:18.237 --> 22:18.571
PERSONAL."

22:18.605 --> 22:24.677
>> SHUT UP!

22:24.711 --> 22:28.948
FIGURES THAT WITCH WOULD CONJURE
UP HER SORCERY.

22:28.981 --> 22:29.816
.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.350
>> IT WASN'T STRATEGY.

22:31.384 --> 22:32.685
IT WAS TO PROVE A POINT.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.353
>> SO SMUG.

22:34.387 --> 22:39.091
IT TAKES DAMN TEAM TO EVEN
ATTEMPT TO TRY AND TAKE YOU OUT.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.562
>> WELL, CHRISTMAS PROBABLY
WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPETE.

22:42.595 --> 22:49.869
SO I'M GOING AGAINST ELENA,
MARK, JOSH, AND ALEX.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.237
I HAVE A 20% CHANCE.

22:51.270 --> 22:55.875
>> YOU'RE STRONGER THAN EACH OF
THEM IN THE COMPETITIONS.

22:55.908 --> 22:59.278
>> WHETHER OR NOT I STAY IN THIS
HOUSE THIS WEEK COMES DOWN TO

22:59.311 --> 23:03.516
THIS: IF I WIN THIS VETO, THIS
HOUSE IS GOING TO HAVE A BIG

23:03.550 --> 23:08.621
PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS BECAUSE
I'M A VERY SORE WINNER, AND I'M

23:08.655 --> 23:11.090
NOT GOING TO BE VERY HUMBLE
ABOUT IT.

23:11.123 --> 23:15.695
EVERYTHING IS ON THE LINE, AND
IT'S DO OR DIE.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.896
IT'S NOT OVER.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.898
>> IT MAKES ME ALL, LIKE, SUPER
PROUD TO BE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

23:38.417 --> 23:43.756
* *
>> MAN!

23:43.790 --> 23:45.992
>> IT'S OTEV.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.426
THIS IS OTEV!

23:47.460 --> 23:48.094
>> YEAH!

23:48.127 --> 23:50.463
>> IT'S THE OTEV COMPETITION!

23:50.497 --> 23:51.964
OH, MY GOSH.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.033
LIKE, THIS IS A BABY LEGEND.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.136
I'M SO JEALOUS I'M NOT
COMPETING.

23:57.169 --> 24:00.072
>> CHRISTMAS, UNFORTUNATELY, A
DOCTOR HAS NOT MEDICALLY CLEARED

24:00.106 --> 24:03.009
YOU TO COMPETE IN THIS
COMPETITION.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.043
YOU MUST SIT OUT.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.946
>> THAT'S PIG POOP!

24:06.979 --> 24:09.982
ULTIMATELY, I KNOW I DID MY JOB
BY GETTING CODY OUT OF THE WAY,

24:10.016 --> 24:12.384
BUT I AM DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY.

24:12.418 --> 24:15.488
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, LET ME
COMPETE SOON.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.323
>> YOU LOOK LIKE NICE PEOPLE.

24:17.356 --> 24:21.127
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE IN SO
LONG, AND I NEED SOME HELP.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.531
COULD YOU COME UP HERE AND
PLEASE HELP ME FIEND MY MOMMY

24:24.564 --> 24:25.231
AND DADDY?

24:25.264 --> 24:25.865
>> YEAH!

24:25.898 --> 24:27.967
>> YEAH!

24:28.000 --> 24:29.201
.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.604
>> OTEV TOTALLY REMINDS ME OF
MYSELF-- HE'S CUTE, HE'S SWEET,

24:31.638 --> 24:34.306
AND IT'S KIND OF SAD THAT HE
LOST HIS FAMILY.

24:34.340 --> 24:37.176
CAN YOU HELP ME FIND MY FAMILY?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.277
, OF COURSE, OTEV.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.378
I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.

24:39.411 --> 24:43.349
>> MY OTEV-- OH, I'M NOT FEELING
TOO WELL.

24:43.382 --> 24:51.558
MY HEAD FEELS FUNNY.

24:51.591 --> 24:55.227
>> HA-HA-HA!

24:55.261 --> 25:09.676
>> YEAH!

25:09.709 --> 25:19.752
>> OTEV, THAT IS A LOW BLOW,
BRO!

25:19.752 --> 25:24.791
>> OTEV, THAT IS A LOW BLOW,
BRO!

25:24.824 --> 25:28.561
>> I'M OTEV, THE POSSESSED
PIGLET.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.529
AND YOU ARE MY SERVANTS.

25:30.563 --> 25:31.964
>> WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?

25:31.998 --> 25:34.934
>> OH, MY GOD!

25:34.967 --> 25:36.669
>> WOOO!

25:36.703 --> 25:37.770
>> YEAH!

25:37.804 --> 25:42.108
>> I NEED SOULS AND YOU WILL
HARVEST THEM FOR ME OR BE

25:42.141 --> 25:43.075
BANISHED TO VETO HELL.

25:43.109 --> 25:46.445
>> LOVELY.

25:46.478 --> 25:49.816
>> IN EACH ROUND, I WILL GIVE
YOU A COMMAND.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.951
THE ANSWER WILL ALWAYS BE A
NUMBER.

25:51.984 --> 25:56.088
WHEN I COMMAND YOU, ENTER THE
HAUNTED SWAMP, SEARCH FOR THE

25:56.122 --> 26:00.526
CORRECT NUMBER OF SOLES, AND
BRING THEM TO ME.

26:00.559 --> 26:05.031
BUT OF BUT BE WARNED-- I WILL
ALSO BE TAKING THE SOLE OF ONE

26:05.064 --> 26:06.633
OF YOU IN EACH ROUND.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.902
IF EVERYONE BRINGS THE CORRECT
NUMBER, THEN I WILL TAKE THE

26:09.936 --> 26:12.171
SOLE OF THE LAST TO RETURN.

26:12.204 --> 26:19.078
THIS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL ONLY
ONE SOLE REMAINS.

26:19.111 --> 26:23.950
AND OH, YEAH, THAT SILLY TOKEN
OF POWER, YOU MORTALS CALL "THE

26:23.983 --> 26:35.728
VETO."

26:35.762 --> 26:37.296
.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.197
>> BEAUTIFUL.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.333
>> I DON'T HAVE CODY NEXT TO ME.

26:41.367 --> 26:42.969
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY TO SAVE ME.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.503
IT'S ALL ON MY SHOULDERS.

26:44.536 --> 26:47.940
SO I JUST HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED
AND GIVE IT EVERYTHING THAT I'VE

26:47.974 --> 26:49.108
GOT.

26:49.141 --> 26:56.182
>> ROUND ONE, BRING ME THE
NUMBER OF SOLES WHO COMPETED IN

26:56.215 --> 26:58.685
BOWLERINA.

26:58.718 --> 27:02.121
>> WHEN OTEV ASKED ME TO BRING
BACK THE NUMBER OF SOLES WHO

27:02.154 --> 27:05.224
COMPETED IN BOWL REENA, I
IMMEDIATELY KNOW THE ANSWER, AND

27:05.257 --> 27:07.359
I LOOKED AMAZING IN THAT TUTU.

27:07.393 --> 27:10.462
>> GO, GO, DIG, DIG, DIG!

27:10.496 --> 27:13.733
>> I'M ON THE BLOCK RIGHT NOW,
AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS GOING

27:13.766 --> 27:15.001
TO SAVE ME IS MYSELF.

27:15.034 --> 27:18.304
>> IN THIS COMPETITION, WE HAVE
TO LISTEN TO OTEV'S CLUE ABOUT A

27:18.337 --> 27:19.305
PREVIOUS CHALLENGE.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.973
IT'S A WHOLE LOT LIKE A GAME OF
MUSICAL CHAIRS.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.342
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE LAST
ONE UP THAT HILL OR YOU'RE OUT.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.944
>> COME ON, COME ON!

27:24.977 --> 27:28.047
>> SO NOW I NEED TO JUMP INSIDE
THIS MUD AND FIND A FOUR BUMENT

27:28.080 --> 27:30.349
THE NUMBERS ARE COVERED WITH ALL
THIS DIRT AND I CAN'T SEE IT.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.551
>> GET DIRTY!

27:32.584 --> 27:33.585
GET DIRTY!

27:33.619 --> 27:36.555
>> IF JESSICA WINS, THERE'S NO
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

27:36.588 --> 27:40.126
ME OR MARK ARE FOR SURE GOING
HOME.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.460
>> I WANT TO WIN VETO.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.563
I WANT TO HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL,
KEEP MY NOMS THE SAME, AND MAKE

27:44.596 --> 27:46.632
SOME MOVES THIS WEEK.

27:46.665 --> 27:50.803
PIGS MIGHT START FLYING BEFORE
ANYBODY PULLS THEMSELVES OFF THE

27:50.837 --> 27:51.637
BLOCK.

27:51.670 --> 28:03.716
I WANT TO BRING HOME THE BACON,
BABY!

28:03.750 --> 28:04.683
>> LET'S GO!

28:04.717 --> 28:05.451
LET'S GO!

28:05.484 --> 28:06.418
LET'S GO!

28:06.452 --> 28:07.019
LET'S GO!

28:07.053 --> 28:14.260
LET'S GO!

28:14.293 --> 28:21.467

28:21.500 --> 28:21.968
YEAH!

28:22.001 --> 28:23.369
>> YOU GOT IT, BABY.

28:23.402 --> 28:27.339
>> IT'S ME AND JESSICA NECK AND
NECK TRYING TO FIND THIS NUMBER

28:27.373 --> 28:30.642
4 SOLE, AND IF THERE'S ANYONE I
NEED TO BEAT IN THIS

28:30.676 --> 28:32.344
COMPETITION, IT'S JESSICA.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.013
>> ELENA, COME ON, GIRL!

28:34.046 --> 28:38.084
>> I'M FINDING EVERY OTHER
NUMBER IN THE BOOK EXCEPT FOR 4.

28:38.117 --> 28:46.793
GIOVER TO THE GRAVEYARD, AND
FINALLY I FIND A NUMBER 4.

28:46.826 --> 28:47.760
>> GO, GO!

28:47.794 --> 28:51.297
>> SHE'S A PLAYER.

28:51.330 --> 28:59.438

28:59.471 --> 29:00.539
>>  ME!

29:00.572 --> 29:05.411
>> HOW MANY SOLES HAVE YOU
BROUGHT OTEV, THE POSSESSED

29:05.444 --> 29:05.778
PIGLET?

29:05.812 --> 29:06.145
>> 4 SOLES.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.013

29:07.914 --> 29:10.049

29:10.082 --> 29:16.789

IS 4.

29:16.823 --> 29:22.528
ELENA, YOU AND YOUR SOLE ARE
ELIMINATED.

29:22.561 --> 29:26.298
>> IF JESSICA WINS THIS VETO, I
MIGHT BE GOING HOME BECAUSE OF

29:26.332 --> 29:26.698
IT.

29:26.732 --> 29:27.867
THAT'S SCARY.

29:27.900 --> 29:32.071
>> ROUND TWO, BRING ME THE
NUMBER OF EVICTED SOLES WHO WERE

29:32.104 --> 29:41.981
SHOWING OFF THEIR TATTOOS IN
INKED AND EVICTED?

29:42.014 --> 29:46.218
>> I INSTANTLY THINK OF
DOMINIQUE, CAMERON, AND JILLIAN.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.486
SO I KNOW MY NUMBER.

29:47.519 --> 29:59.231
IT'S 3, AND I'M GUNNING FOR A 3.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.732
>> GET TBUDDY!

30:00.766 --> 30:02.034
GET IT, BUDDY!

30:02.068 --> 30:03.369
GET UP THERE, BUDDY!

30:03.402 --> 30:04.971
GET UP THERE!

30:05.004 --> 30:06.138
NICE!

30:06.172 --> 30:09.641
>> I HEAR JESSICA RIGHT BEHIND
ME, AND I GET A LITTLE PANIC

30:09.675 --> 30:10.409
ATTACK.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.879
I CAN'T LET JESSICA ELIMINATE
ME.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.514
>> JOSH AND ALEX ARE ALREADY UP
THERE.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.549
MY LIFE IN THIS GAME IS
ABSOLUTELY ON THE LINE.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.801
* *
>> JOSH, HIDE YOUR NUMBER.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.803
>> I'M HELPLESS ON THE
SIDELINES.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.439
AND I CAN SEE THEM TEAMING UP
AGAINST HER.

30:40.472 --> 30:44.043
IF ME AND JESSICA ARE GOING TO
SURVIVE THIS WEEK, SHE'S GOT TO

30:44.076 --> 30:46.979
WIN VETO, AND IT'S AS SIMPLE AS
THAT.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.115
>> COME ON, GET IT, BUDDY!

30:49.148 --> 30:49.949
GET IT!

30:49.982 --> 30:51.083
GET UP THERE!

30:51.117 --> 30:52.284
NICE!

30:52.318 --> 30:56.222
>> MARK'S MAKING HIS WAY UP
THERE, BUT HE'S KIND OF WALKING,

30:56.255 --> 30:59.291
SO I'M GOING TO USE THIS AS MY
OPPORTUNITY TO RUN PAST HIM AND

30:59.325 --> 31:04.396
STEAL THAT LOG.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.697
>> RUN, RUN!

31:05.731 --> 31:16.375
>> GO, MARK, GO!

31:16.408 --> 31:20.779
>> HOW MANY SEOULS HAVE YOU
BROUGHT OSEVEN?

31:20.812 --> 31:21.713
>> THREE SOLES.

31:21.747 --> 31:23.082

31:23.983 --> 31:28.887
>> THE CORRECT NUMBER OF SOLES
IS THREE.

31:28.921 --> 31:32.558
JESSICA, YOU AND YOUR SOLE ARE
ELIMINATED.

31:32.591 --> 31:38.597
>> WE WERE REALLY, REALLY CLOSE
TO ACCOMPLISHING EVERYTHING THAT

31:38.630 --> 31:44.603
WE SET OUT TO THIS WEEK.

31:44.636 --> 31:51.743
IF I WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT
FASTER, I COULD HAVE PULLED IT

31:51.777 --> 31:52.178
OUT.

31:52.211 --> 31:57.749
THEY GOT LUCKY.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.286
>> SO JESSICA WAS OUT, AND
THAT'S GOOD.

32:00.319 --> 32:03.122
BUT I WANT TO WIN THE VETO.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.323
WHY?

32:04.356 --> 32:05.958
I WANT TO KEEP MY NOMINATIONS
THE SAME AND SEE HOW THE WEEK

32:05.992 --> 32:07.994
PLAYS OUT.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.395
.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.097
>> OH, MY GOD.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.699
>> WHY ARE YOU SO MESSY?

32:13.732 --> 32:15.634
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.470
OH, I'M NOT FEELING TOO WELL.

32:18.504 --> 32:19.671
MY HEAD FEELS FUNNY.

32:19.705 --> 32:30.049
>> OH, MY--
>> GET THEM!

32:30.082 --> 32:39.825
GET THEM!

32:39.858 --> 32:41.927
>> THAT'S, LIKE, SUPER
AGGRESSIVE.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.262
>> THAT IS REALLY AGGRESSIVE!

32:43.295 --> 32:44.530
>> ROUND THREE.

32:44.563 --> 32:49.835
BRING ME THE NUMBER OF SOLES WHO
GAVE PUNISHMENTS TO OTHER

32:49.868 --> 32:54.340
PLAYERS IN "WHAT'S THE HOLD-UP."

32:54.373 --> 33:00.246
( HORN
( PROBL.>> I REMEMBER THIS COMPE

33:00.279 --> 33:04.450
BECAUSE I WAS THE HOST OF IT,
AND I WAS A SUPER, HOT SMOKING

33:04.483 --> 33:05.117
COP.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.185
BUT THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT.

33:06.218 --> 33:09.555
IT WAS MY DUTY IN THE GAME TO
DOLE OUT PUNISHMENTS.

33:09.588 --> 33:12.458
AND THERE WERE 10 PEOPLE WHO
GAVE OUT PUNISHMENTS IN THAT

33:12.491 --> 33:16.028
COMPETITION.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.664
>> SO AS SOON AS I FINALLY
FIGURE OUT IT'S 10 AND I FIND

33:18.697 --> 33:21.667
THE 10, I LOOK AROUND, AND JOSH
AND ALEX ARE STILL LOOKING.

33:21.700 --> 33:25.137
SO I TAKE ADVANTAGE, AND START
PILING UP NUMBERS FOR THE NEXT

33:25.171 --> 33:28.507
ROUND.

33:28.540 --> 33:32.211
AND THEN I GO BACK UP TO SEE
OTEV.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.246
>> HE DID NOT FIND IT!

33:44.856 --> 33:51.163
>> GOOD JOB, ALEX!

33:51.197 --> 33:54.366
>> HOW MANY SOLES HAVE YOU
BROUGHT OTEV?

33:54.400 --> 33:56.268
>> I BROUGHT YOU 10 SOLES!

33:56.302 --> 33:58.204
>> 10 SOLES, BIG BOY!

33:58.237 --> 34:04.176
>> THE CORRECT NUMBER OF SOLES
IS 10.

34:04.210 --> 34:10.182
JOSH, YOU AND YOUR SOLE ARE
ELIMINATED.

34:10.216 --> 34:14.220
>> I'M OUT OF THE COMPETITION SO
NOW IT'S DOWN TO MARK AND ALEX.

34:14.253 --> 34:18.290
SO I JUST HOPE ALEX PULLS
THROUGH, WE KEEP NOMINATIONS THE

34:18.324 --> 34:20.992
SAME AND MARK DOESN'T END UP
WINNING.

34:21.026 --> 34:22.561
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS, GOOD LUCK.

34:22.594 --> 34:23.895
>> GOOD LUCK, GIRL.

34:23.929 --> 34:24.696
>> GOOD LUCK.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.932
>> NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL
ROUND.

34:26.965 --> 34:31.870
BRING ME THE NUMBER OF SOLES WHO
SCORED UNDER 20 POINTS IN "UNDER

34:31.903 --> 34:34.005
THE WEATHER."

34:34.039 --> 34:37.809
>> SO IT'S DOWN TO ME AND ALEX,

34:37.843 --> 34:39.878
BUT SHE'S NOT THE ONE ON THE
BLOCK, I AM.

34:39.911 --> 34:43.582
SO I NEED TO GO WIN THIS FINAL
ROUND AND TAKE MYSELF OFF.

34:43.615 --> 34:46.918
SO OTEV ASKS ME TO BRING BACK
THE NUMBER OF SOLES WHO SCORED

34:46.952 --> 34:52.057
UNDER 20 IN "UNDER THE WEATHER."

34:52.090 --> 34:55.694
>> ALL THESE NUMBERS ARE
SWIRLING AROUND AND IT'S KIND OF

34:55.727 --> 34:56.962
GETTING REALLY CONFUSING.

34:56.995 --> 35:00.766
I JUST HAVE TO GET UP THAT RAMP
WITH A NUMBER BEFORE MARK DOES.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.769
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE
ANSWER IS, BUT IT'S DO OR DIE

35:03.802 --> 35:05.003
RIGHT NOW.

35:05.036 --> 35:07.239
SO I'M JUST HOPING THIS NUMBER
IS RIGHT AND SOMEHOW I CAN BEAT

35:07.273 --> 35:12.544
ALEX UP TO THAT STOP.

35:12.578 --> 35:15.046
>> THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE I JUST
BEAT MARK!

35:15.080 --> 35:17.183
>> GOOD JOB, AL!

35:17.216 --> 35:18.217
>> MY NUMBER!

35:18.250 --> 35:24.190
>> I REALIZE I'M NOT HOLDING MY
SOLE!

35:24.223 --> 35:24.756
WHERE IS IT?

35:24.790 --> 35:26.658
>> YOU GOTTA GO GET IT.

35:26.692 --> 35:27.793
>> YOU GOTTA GET IT.

35:27.826 --> 35:32.531
>> IN THE BOTTOM OF THE POND IS
MY SHOE SOLE.

35:32.564 --> 35:35.434
LITERAL ME, MY CHANCES OF WIN
HAVING WASHED AWAY.

35:35.467 --> 35:40.972
>> HOW MANY SOLES HAVE YOU
BROUGHT OTEV, THE POSSESSED PIG

35:41.006 --> 35:41.440
THE, MARK?

35:41.473 --> 35:42.241
>> 5?

35:42.274 --> 35:47.413
>> THE CORRECT NUMBER OF SOLES
IS 5.

35:47.446 --> 35:52.318
ALEX, YOU AND YOUR SOLE ARE
ELIMINATED.

35:52.351 --> 35:53.719
CONGRATULATIONS, MARK.

35:53.752 --> 36:03.094
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

36:03.128 --> 36:11.102
>>> IT FEELS SO GOOD TO WIN THIS

36:11.136 --> 36:13.639
THE MEATBALL PUT ME UP AND NOW
HE'S MY CANNOLI.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.675
BUT ELENA IS STILL ON THE BLOCK
SO I'M STILL WORRIED THAT THERE

36:16.708 --> 36:18.577
IS A CHANCE SHE WILL GO HOME.

36:18.610 --> 36:21.247
>> HE LOOKS LIKE THE HULK RIGHT
NOW.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.581
>> HE LOOKS LIKE HULK.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.450
>> SO THIS COMPLETELY SUCKS.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.985
I WANTED TO KEEP MY NOMS THE
SAME.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.355
NOW I HAVE TO COME UP WITH
ANOTHER REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

36:29.388 --> 36:33.259
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THERE IS
LEFT TO DO.

36:33.292 --> 36:40.399
I THINK MY GAME IS OVER.

36:43.835 --> 36:51.142
* *
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL?

36:58.049 --> 37:08.159
PROBABLY A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT
STUFF, HUH?

37:08.159 --> 37:14.433
PROBABLY A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT
STUFF, HUH?

37:14.466 --> 37:19.571
>> THE HARD OAST PART ABOUT
LEAVING THIS GAME IS KNOWING

37:19.605 --> 37:25.311
THAT I'M LEAVING CODY.

37:25.344 --> 37:31.450
UM, I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE SAD
OR UPSET, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

37:31.483 --> 37:45.531
A CODY AND I AFTER THE HOUSE.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.737
>> ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?

37:51.770 --> 37:56.308
>> I AM GOING TO BE ANGRY.

37:56.342 --> 38:06.685
AND I'M GOING TO RIP THROUGH
THIS PLACE.

38:06.718 --> 38:11.623
AND AT NIGHT, I'LL BE BUMMED.

38:11.657 --> 38:19.965
I WON'T HAVE MY BEST FRIEND TO
TALK TO.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.467
I'M GOING TO BE LOST WITHOUT
HER.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.034
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.269
I TAKE THINGS PERSONALLY.

38:24.302 --> 38:28.206
I HATE WHEN THESE IDIOTS KEEP
SAYING, "IT'S JUST A GAME."

38:28.239 --> 38:30.208
IT'S NOT JUST A GAME TO ME.

38:30.241 --> 38:32.944
EVERYTHING BETWEEN ME AND
JESSICA, THAT'S NOT JUST A GAME

38:32.978 --> 38:33.745
TO ME.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.348
>> I WANT TO SEE YOU TAKE OUT
PAUL.

38:36.382 --> 38:40.819
>> I'M GOING TO TRY.

38:40.852 --> 38:44.390
>> I HATE THAT I'M LEAVING YOU.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.425
WE PUT UP ONE HELL OF A FIGHT.

38:59.705 --> 39:05.944
TO SAY.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.780
>> WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY,
MATTY?

39:08.814 --> 39:11.450
>> WAS IT ABOUT THE BLOCK OR
SOMETHING?

39:11.483 --> 39:14.420
>> ABOUT THE BLOCK?

39:14.453 --> 39:18.223
>> MARK IS GOING TO USE THE VETO
ON HIMSELF, SO NOW I GOTTA PUT

39:18.256 --> 39:19.825
UP A REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.260
>> AND REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO AT THIS POINT.

39:22.293 --> 39:26.097
>> I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT
SOMEONE ELSE UP--

39:26.131 --> 39:28.700
>> SO HERE'S THE THING.

39:28.734 --> 39:34.806
IF MARK USES THE VETO, WE DON'T
MIND GOING UP.

39:34.840 --> 39:39.411
AND, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S NO
REPERCUSSIONS FOR YOU.

39:39.445 --> 39:43.114
OF ALL WEEKS TO GO UP AS A PAWN,
THIS IS NOT A BAD ONE TO DO IT.

39:43.148 --> 39:47.118
IT'S NEVER A BAD LOOK TO TAKE
ONE FOR THE TEAM, AND JESSICA IS

39:47.152 --> 39:47.919
GOING HOME REGARDLESS.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.655
>> I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DO
THAT.

39:49.688 --> 39:50.756
THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT IT.

39:50.789 --> 39:54.392
>> YOU'RE UP A CREEK WITH NO
PADDLE, BUT WE'LL BE YOUR

39:54.426 --> 39:55.093
PADDLE.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.361
I'M WILLING TO GO UP AS A PAWN.

39:56.394 --> 40:00.165
I GET TO SIT NEXT TO JESSICA ON
THE BLOCK, AND SHE'S GOING TO GO

40:00.198 --> 40:01.332
HOME.

40:01.366 --> 40:05.036
IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF A
CHERRY ON TOP OF MY SUN DAY.

40:05.070 --> 40:11.076
>> WOULD YOU WANT TO GO UP OR
WOULD MATT WANT TO GO UP.

40:11.109 --> 40:11.943
>> WHICHEVER YOU WANT.

40:11.977 --> 40:18.717
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

40:19.618 --> 40:32.464
>> HEY, EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR
THE VETO MEETING.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.900
>> THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.103
JOSH HAS NOMINATED ME AND ELENA
FOR EVICTION.

40:38.136 --> 40:41.139
BECAUSE JESSICA CAME IN LAST
PLACE IN THE TEMPTATION

40:41.172 --> 40:44.342
COMPETITION, SHE IS THE THIRD
NOMINEE.

40:44.375 --> 40:47.012
BUT I HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE
OF THESE NOMINATIONS.

40:47.045 --> 40:52.050
THIS MEATBALL PUT ME UP AS A
PAWN, BUT I'M MORE OF A DESSERT

40:52.083 --> 40:53.284
GUY.

40:53.318 --> 40:55.353
SO, CANNOLI, I HAVE DECIDED TO
USE THE POWER OF VETO ON MYSELF.

40:55.386 --> 40:58.423
SINCE I'VE JUST VETOED ONE OF
YOUR NOMINATIONS, YOU WILL HAVE

40:58.456 --> 41:02.160
TO NAME A REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

41:02.193 --> 41:06.632
>> MY REPLACEMENT AGREED AND SHE
KNOWS THE PLAN, SO, RAVEN, IF

41:06.665 --> 41:19.645
YOU COULD TAKE A SEAT.

41:21.913 --> 41:33.124
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.927
>> ARE MY FEELINGS HURT?

41:35.961 --> 41:36.427
NO.

41:36.461 --> 41:37.563
DO I FEEL DEFEATED?

41:37.596 --> 41:38.764
NO.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.032
BUT IF I'M GOING OUT THAT DOOR
ON THURSDAY, I WANT TO CAUSE A

41:41.066 --> 41:45.136
LITTLE DRAMA BEFORE I LEAVE, AND
FLIP THIS HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN.

41:45.170 --> 41:49.941
>> WHAT THEY DID WITH ME AND
JESSICA IS JUST-- IT'S

41:49.975 --> 41:51.176
UNACCEPTABLE.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.712
I'M PISSED OFF ABOUT IT, AND I'M
GOING TO TRY TO STRIP THEM ALL

41:53.745 --> 41:55.881
OF 500,000.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.717
I DON'T EVEN CARE IF I WIN IT.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.451
I JUST DON'T WANT THEM TO WIN
IT.

42:00.485 --> 42:03.021
>> WOOO!

42:03.054 --> 42:05.456
"OPERATION GET JESSICA OUT" IS
NOW ALMOST COMPLETE.

42:05.490 --> 42:10.028
NOW WE CAN FINALLY SPLIT JESSICA
AND CODY UP AND KEEP

42:10.061 --> 42:11.296
STEAMROLLING FORWARD.

42:11.329 --> 42:14.666
>> SITTING ON THE BLOCK NEXT TO
JESSICA FEELS PRETTY GOOD BEING

42:14.700 --> 42:17.068
THAT SHE'S SUCH A BIG TARGET.

42:17.102 --> 42:19.470
AND RAVEN'S CEEND OF JUST THERE.

42:19.504 --> 42:21.106
BUT I'M STILL SCARED.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.340
THIS IS "BIG BROTHER."

42:22.373 --> 42:25.577
I'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE DAYS TILL
THURSDAY SO I NEED TO LAY LOW

42:25.611 --> 42:28.213
AND MAKE SURE I DON'T PISS
SOMEBODY OFF.

42:28.246 --> 42:31.516
>> I KNOW THE HOUSE AND PAUL
WANT JESSICA OUT, BUT THAT'S NOT

42:31.549 --> 42:32.851
WHAT'S BEST FOR MY GAME.

42:32.884 --> 42:37.288
WHAT'S BEST FOR MY GAME IS
GETTING SHADY ELENA OUT OF THE

42:37.322 --> 42:38.489
HOUSE.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.759
NOW I HAVE TO COME UP WITH A
PLAN TO ENSURE THAT ELENA WALKS

42:40.792 --> 42:41.993
THROUGH THOSE DOORS ON THURSDAY.

42:42.027 --> 42:44.630
>> WHO WILL BE EVICTED FROM THE
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE, JESSICA,

42:44.663 --> 42:46.197
ELENA, OR RAVEN?

42:46.231 --> 42:57.142
FIND OUT LIVE THURSDAY AT 9:00,
8:00 CENTRAL, ON "BIG BROTHER."
