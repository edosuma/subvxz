01:52.121 --> 01:54.155
I can't believe you're
doing this to me.

01:57.026 --> 01:58.761
After all I've done for you.

01:59.929 --> 02:01.263
But I am.

02:02.965 --> 02:04.600
Why won't you listen to me?

02:08.737 --> 02:09.606
I can't.

02:12.109 --> 02:13.009
But I will.

02:15.712 --> 02:17.281
I just need more time.

03:31.093 --> 03:32.793
Hello?

03:32.795 --> 03:34.097
Is anybody there?

03:35.765 --> 03:36.400
Maria?

03:37.534 --> 03:39.703
Is that you?

04:30.358 --> 04:31.225
Very funny.

04:32.393 --> 04:34.196
This isn't a joke anymore.

05:31.890 --> 05:34.361
I'm here.

08:24.711 --> 08:26.045
Hey lass, lass.

08:27.081 --> 08:28.649
Come here, come here.

08:29.683 --> 08:30.551
Good dog.

08:33.354 --> 08:34.221
Good dog.

08:35.256 --> 08:36.123
Hello.

08:36.823 --> 08:38.357
Nice.

08:38.359 --> 08:39.726
Good dog.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.296
Let's go, let's go.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.264
Come on.

10:59.011 --> 11:00.780
Got an appointment?

11:01.714 --> 11:02.749
Let him in.

11:14.326 --> 11:15.195
Arthur.

11:16.396 --> 11:17.863
I just wish you
were as enthusiastic

11:17.865 --> 11:19.330
about finishing
your book as you are

11:19.332 --> 11:20.601
about getting here on time.

11:21.536 --> 11:22.403
Tea?

11:24.338 --> 11:25.771
Okay?

11:25.773 --> 11:27.339
Okay, tea for two, please.

11:27.341 --> 11:28.307
Eh, coffee actually.

11:28.309 --> 11:29.210
Black, no sugar.

11:30.478 --> 11:31.345
So.

11:32.448 --> 11:33.615
It's coming.

11:34.650 --> 11:35.517
Are you sure?

11:38.386 --> 11:39.221
Um.

11:39.956 --> 11:41.390
What are the figures like?

11:42.524 --> 11:44.324
Oh, don't
change the subject.

11:44.326 --> 11:46.761
Arthur, you're supposed to
be my business manager here.

11:46.763 --> 11:48.396
I don't see a
manuscript in your hand.

11:48.398 --> 11:50.064
You do understand what a
deadline is, don't you?

11:50.066 --> 11:51.432
Of course I do.

11:51.434 --> 11:52.801
You're a best
selling horror author

11:52.803 --> 11:55.003
and frankly, you're nothing
without this new book.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.005
You sold the film rights.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.440
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong

11:58.442 --> 12:00.776
but nobody's short
of cash, are they?

12:00.778 --> 12:03.747
No, I didn't say that.

12:03.749 --> 12:04.914
Look, your last book, yeah,

12:04.916 --> 12:06.381
it generated some real heat.

12:06.383 --> 12:07.883
That's why the
publishers are keen

12:07.885 --> 12:09.519
to get another one.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.454
I mean, come on, you could
be the next Stephen King.

12:11.456 --> 12:12.655
I very much doubt that.

12:12.657 --> 12:16.861
I mean, I'd prefer to be H.P.
Lovecraft or Clive Barker.

12:16.863 --> 12:18.028
I think you could
benefit us both

12:18.030 --> 12:19.596
if you cleaned up your image.

12:19.598 --> 12:22.099
I mean, cut out the
drink for a start.

12:22.101 --> 12:23.067
Yeah.

12:23.069 --> 12:24.835
The money from the film is good.

12:24.837 --> 12:27.705
Fine, but the fact is
you still need to write.

12:27.707 --> 12:28.807
I am!

12:28.809 --> 12:30.010
So what is it, family?

12:33.947 --> 12:35.981
She's taken the kids.

12:35.983 --> 12:36.882
I see.

12:36.884 --> 12:38.049
How long for?

12:38.051 --> 12:39.686
I don't know.

12:41.022 --> 12:43.989
This time, it does
feel permanent.

12:43.991 --> 12:45.792
Well look, I'm
sorry to hear that...

12:45.794 --> 12:48.393
But I still have to type, right?

12:48.395 --> 12:50.831
Brendan, what is it
you're not getting?

12:50.833 --> 12:52.067
You're a story teller.

12:53.735 --> 12:55.804
And you're nothing
without this new book.

12:57.907 --> 12:58.772
What is it?

12:58.774 --> 12:59.640
Okay.

12:59.642 --> 13:00.541
Have you got block?

13:00.543 --> 13:01.576
Is that what this is?

13:03.146 --> 13:04.611
Look here.

13:04.613 --> 13:06.446
It's not as bad as you think.

13:06.448 --> 13:08.317
Have you written anything?

13:09.853 --> 13:10.985
I mean Christ.

13:10.987 --> 13:11.853
You signed a three
book contract.

13:11.855 --> 13:13.121
You sold one book.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.592
You've got obligations,
I've got obligations.

13:16.961 --> 13:18.860
It doesn't just
happen like that.

13:18.862 --> 13:19.727
Doesn't it?

13:19.729 --> 13:20.830
Well, it's got to.

13:20.832 --> 13:22.533
I don't care how
but it's got to.

13:23.734 --> 13:25.868
Arthur, you need to calm down.

13:25.870 --> 13:27.837
These deals are with some
very important people

13:27.839 --> 13:30.673
and they do not like
no for an answer.

13:30.675 --> 13:33.743
I'm not just a money
making machine, you know.

13:33.745 --> 13:37.113
All right, look,
this can be fixed.

13:37.115 --> 13:38.748
How?

13:38.750 --> 13:40.184
A retreat.

13:40.186 --> 13:41.718
A remote location.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.422
No internet, no distractions.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.590
It can be fixed.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.758
I'm gonna give
you Paul's number.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.627
Who's Paul?

13:49.728 --> 13:51.063
He's got the address.

13:51.065 --> 13:53.131
Look, you've got three
weeks to give me something.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.333
No more pipeline.

13:54.335 --> 13:57.169
Else you'll be out there with
the rest of the has-beens.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.073
Now, take this number.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.676
And fuck off.

14:11.086 --> 14:12.787
Nice to see you too.

14:19.194 --> 14:20.061
Sir.

14:22.564 --> 14:23.431
Sir.

14:24.934 --> 14:25.800
Is he the one?

14:27.803 --> 14:29.670
One at a time, Cam.

14:29.672 --> 14:30.806
One at a time.

14:58.237 --> 14:59.104
Hello?

15:04.710 --> 15:05.577
Hello?

15:12.751 --> 15:14.587
Is there anyone there?

15:17.123 --> 15:18.792
I've got a permit, you know.

15:21.996 --> 15:24.595
This is some kind of joke,

15:24.597 --> 15:25.433
it's not very funny.

15:34.276 --> 15:36.742
I can see you.

16:01.838 --> 16:03.707
This is far as I go.

16:04.742 --> 16:06.575
So where is it?

16:06.577 --> 16:07.244
Down there.

16:08.813 --> 16:10.313
I don't go down there.

16:10.315 --> 16:11.582
You're on your own.

16:19.858 --> 16:22.061
Are you going to give
me help with my luggage?

16:49.856 --> 16:51.824
I will need a receipt, you know.

18:14.449 --> 18:15.316
Need help?

18:17.118 --> 18:18.852
Uh, yes.

18:20.356 --> 18:21.923
I'm looking for a cottage.

18:25.460 --> 18:27.163
Are you out here alone?

18:28.397 --> 18:30.665
I should ask
you the same thing.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.966
Yeah, but you're a...

18:32.968 --> 18:33.836
A woman?

18:34.837 --> 18:36.138
How chivalrous of you.

18:37.273 --> 18:39.009
You think me meek and mild?

18:40.043 --> 18:40.911
Anything but.

18:44.382 --> 18:45.982
So you're lost then.

18:47.217 --> 18:48.084
Uh, yeah.

18:50.821 --> 18:52.789
I'm looking for this place.

18:54.225 --> 18:57.094
The damn taxi dropped me off
at the wrong place I think.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.131
Do you know it?

19:07.506 --> 19:10.508
Do you often stare at
women quite so obviously?

19:10.510 --> 19:11.376
No, I...

19:13.812 --> 19:14.480
Sorry.

19:16.115 --> 19:16.983
It's fine.

19:18.117 --> 19:19.017
I'm only teasing.

19:21.254 --> 19:22.121
Thanks.

19:25.091 --> 19:27.861
So are you local to the area?

19:29.363 --> 19:30.431
Why do you ask?

19:32.132 --> 19:34.333
Just wanted to know, really.

19:34.335 --> 19:37.037
Just wanted to know.

19:38.273 --> 19:39.140
Yeah, well.

19:40.874 --> 19:45.880
You have a friendly
face and, um...

19:50.253 --> 19:53.087
Probably should stop
there really, shouldn't I?

19:53.089 --> 19:53.955
You're fine.

19:56.892 --> 19:57.760
Thanks.

19:59.562 --> 20:01.397
Well, the good news
is you're close.

20:02.332 --> 20:04.001
You just follow this road down.

20:04.900 --> 20:05.801
Take a left.

20:06.570 --> 20:09.406
And then follow it to the end.

20:10.575 --> 20:11.441
The end?

20:13.610 --> 20:16.245
It's at the end of the road.

20:16.247 --> 20:17.448
You have a nice smile.

20:18.516 --> 20:19.517
Thank you.

20:25.490 --> 20:30.192
I don't suppose you
could walk with me

20:30.194 --> 20:31.961
to the place, 'cause, you know,

20:31.963 --> 20:34.064
I might end up lost.

20:34.066 --> 20:34.931
No.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.099
Oh.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.934
I'm not going
in your direction.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.304
Right.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.471
Okay.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.341
But...

20:44.478 --> 20:46.212
Maybe we'll see
each other again.

20:47.947 --> 20:48.815
Yes?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.484
That would be really nice.

20:52.486 --> 20:53.354
Don't worry.

20:54.355 --> 20:56.288
I know where to find you.

20:56.290 --> 20:59.593
After all, I did just
give you directions.

21:00.961 --> 21:02.529
Yeah, you did.

21:02.531 --> 21:03.165
Thank you.

21:04.499 --> 21:06.932
You take care of yourself now.

21:06.934 --> 21:07.569
See you later.

22:05.499 --> 22:08.669
Oh bloody hell, there's
no Wi-Fi, is there?

22:24.685 --> 22:26.051
For me?

22:26.053 --> 22:26.921
Brendan Cobbs?

22:27.689 --> 22:28.557
Yeah.

22:29.558 --> 22:30.757
Do I need to sign for it?

22:30.759 --> 22:33.228
Nah, it's all yours, mate.

25:49.908 --> 25:54.512
Do you
want to come out to play?

26:52.341 --> 26:55.744
Hello,
my name is Alfred.

26:55.746 --> 26:58.747
Follow my rules and
all will be well.

26:58.749 --> 27:00.048
Rule one.

27:00.050 --> 27:02.617
Feed me 12 leaves
picked from the orchard

27:02.619 --> 27:05.355
and I will be quiet
at 12 months.

27:06.690 --> 27:08.290
Rule two.

27:08.292 --> 27:11.660
You must follow rule one
or I will not be happy.

27:11.662 --> 27:12.862
Rule three.

27:12.864 --> 27:14.799
You must follow
rule one or else.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.934
Rule four.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.539
You must follow rule
one or you will die.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.913
I'm here.

28:17.700 --> 28:18.568
Hello.

28:21.704 --> 28:22.572
Hello?

28:25.475 --> 28:26.343
Hello?

28:32.851 --> 28:34.518
Lives could be in danger.

28:35.419 --> 28:36.087
Danger?

28:37.155 --> 28:38.021
What do you mean?

28:38.023 --> 28:40.523
Just listen to me!

28:40.525 --> 28:41.726
Well, I am.

28:42.861 --> 28:43.663
Who's in danger?

28:45.031 --> 28:47.131
Is this something
to do with Arthur?

28:47.133 --> 28:48.165
Arthur?

28:48.167 --> 28:49.334
Yeah, he's my...

28:50.937 --> 28:52.905
Look, what's the issue?

28:54.106 --> 28:56.342
Have you followed rule one?

28:57.710 --> 29:00.477
No, I haven't.

29:00.479 --> 29:01.179
Should I have?

29:01.181 --> 29:02.480
You have to.

29:02.482 --> 29:04.482
You have to!

29:04.484 --> 29:06.017
Okay, mate, listen.

29:06.019 --> 29:10.156
You need to calm down
and go back that way.

29:10.158 --> 29:12.490
You might still have time.

29:12.492 --> 29:13.761
You might still have time!

29:43.895 --> 29:44.761
Okay.

29:45.829 --> 29:46.897
Let's do this.

30:21.701 --> 30:22.835
Were it you?

30:25.706 --> 30:26.705
Were it you?

30:26.707 --> 30:28.040
Me what?

30:28.042 --> 30:29.810
Left my fucking gate open.

30:32.213 --> 30:33.114
No, sorry.

30:34.048 --> 30:35.482
All the animals got out.

30:36.650 --> 30:37.750
Your animals.

30:37.752 --> 30:38.887
Yeah, my livestock.

30:44.592 --> 30:45.860
This gate, did you open it?

30:46.895 --> 30:47.762
No, sorry.

30:49.130 --> 30:51.133
You're one of them
city types, ain't you?

30:54.170 --> 30:55.636
Are you for real?

30:55.638 --> 30:57.740
Soft hands, soft head.

30:59.041 --> 31:00.874
Wouldn't know a days
work if he saw it coming.

31:00.876 --> 31:02.746
Got that arrogance
about you and all.

31:06.316 --> 31:09.017
Bluster thinks he can talk
to people how he feels.

31:09.019 --> 31:11.621
Are you normally this
present to your neighbors?

31:12.889 --> 31:14.090
Look.

31:14.092 --> 31:15.958
I just wanted to
know if it was you

31:15.960 --> 31:16.826
that opened the gate.

31:16.828 --> 31:18.294
You says it weren't.

31:18.296 --> 31:19.163
You can go.

31:26.205 --> 31:27.072
Thank you.

31:30.575 --> 31:31.243
Wait.

31:35.080 --> 31:37.082
Did you make sure you
followed the rule?

31:38.118 --> 31:39.718
Oh yeah, that rule.

31:40.887 --> 31:42.286
Why would you give a shit?

31:42.288 --> 31:44.655
Look, I don't cares about you

31:44.657 --> 31:46.526
just as long as you
follow the rule.

31:50.931 --> 31:51.765
By the way.

31:53.267 --> 31:55.601
There's a random fella
about, wild-eyed.

31:55.603 --> 31:56.802
I was wondering if you knew him,

31:56.804 --> 31:58.105
maybe one of your neighbors.

32:03.078 --> 32:03.912
No?

32:05.247 --> 32:06.979
Okay.

32:06.981 --> 32:08.214
Well, you have a great day.

32:08.216 --> 32:09.149
Nice gum, by the way.

32:09.151 --> 32:12.719
Just make sure you
polish it at the end.

32:12.721 --> 32:13.622
Have a great day.

32:15.158 --> 32:20.163
Fucking asshole.

32:47.392 --> 32:49.393
So you found it then.

32:57.069 --> 32:57.903
You.

33:01.441 --> 33:02.906
What are you doing here?

33:02.908 --> 33:04.211
I'm your neighbor.

33:06.279 --> 33:07.745
Neighbor?

33:07.747 --> 33:08.780
Yeah.

33:08.782 --> 33:09.716
The farm.

33:11.818 --> 33:12.685
Oh.

33:14.255 --> 33:15.755
What are you doing here now?

33:17.023 --> 33:18.792
Thought I'd give you a greeting.

33:23.197 --> 33:24.065
Greeting.

33:27.102 --> 33:28.035
What time is it?

33:29.036 --> 33:30.171
Nine o'clock.

33:33.408 --> 33:34.343
Nine o'clock?

33:36.845 --> 33:41.850
I thought it was the
middle of the night and...

33:44.187 --> 33:45.186
Maybe some other time.

33:45.188 --> 33:46.921
Please.

33:46.923 --> 33:49.056
I gave you directions.

33:49.058 --> 33:51.961
The least you could do is join
a lonely girl for a drink.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.072
White or red?

34:04.074 --> 34:04.942
Red.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.956
So what's your story?

34:26.866 --> 34:28.098
I'm a writer.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.800
Really?

34:29.802 --> 34:31.503
What sort of stuff?

34:31.505 --> 34:32.773
Mainly horror.

34:34.107 --> 34:36.241
Not really my scene.

34:36.243 --> 34:38.346
There's enough horror
in the world already.

34:41.482 --> 34:42.349
Does it pay well?

34:44.052 --> 34:45.150
Well enough.

34:45.152 --> 34:46.020
Enjoy it?

34:48.156 --> 34:49.291
That's another story.

34:50.925 --> 34:51.859
Forgive the pun.

34:52.827 --> 34:53.828
Frustrated?

34:56.532 --> 34:57.399
Maybe.

34:58.934 --> 35:01.438
Horror's not what I
originally intended on doing.

35:02.871 --> 35:03.739
No?

35:05.407 --> 35:09.212
No, I see myself as a
Dylan Thomas or a, uh,

35:13.183 --> 35:14.150
Ted Hughes.

35:15.919 --> 35:18.421
Except nobody wants to
read that, they're...

35:26.298 --> 35:27.865
Immediate satisfaction.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.441
That's right.

35:37.443 --> 35:39.445
It's all now, now, now.

35:41.413 --> 35:43.046
No patience.

35:43.048 --> 35:44.117
That's a real shame.

35:46.452 --> 35:47.853
So you turned to horror.

35:49.523 --> 35:50.391
Yes.

35:51.425 --> 35:54.058
It's easier to scare people.

35:54.060 --> 35:54.927
It is?

35:58.198 --> 35:59.065
Thank you.

36:00.334 --> 36:01.900
Yeah, well, you know.

36:01.902 --> 36:06.638
If you set pieces here
and there and hey, presto,

36:06.640 --> 36:07.509
you're there.

36:08.343 --> 36:10.045
You make it sound easy.

36:12.179 --> 36:13.414
Well.

36:13.416 --> 36:15.484
It's not that difficult,
put it that way.

36:17.018 --> 36:19.355
And what about your family?

36:21.223 --> 36:24.460
That's a horror story in itself.

36:26.028 --> 36:28.497
Now that sounds like an
interesting tale to tell.

36:32.102 --> 36:33.270
Maybe some other time.

36:34.438 --> 36:36.373
There might
not be another time.

36:39.910 --> 36:41.109
Why?

36:41.111 --> 36:45.114
Are you planning
on going somewhere?

36:45.116 --> 36:46.217
Well, you never know.

36:47.984 --> 36:49.354
Yeah, I suppose.

36:51.456 --> 36:53.858
Why don't you make
yourself more comfortable?

36:54.992 --> 36:55.860
In a minute.

36:57.962 --> 36:58.896
Who is that?

37:02.201 --> 37:03.102
That?

37:04.703 --> 37:07.003
That's a fucking nightmare.

37:07.005 --> 37:08.139
That's it?

37:08.141 --> 37:10.140
That's all you're going to say?

37:10.142 --> 37:11.478
He is amazing.

37:19.018 --> 37:19.986
Top up?

37:22.623 --> 37:25.159
So why don't you tell me
really why you're here?

37:26.260 --> 37:28.429
Can't a girl come
around for some company?

37:30.030 --> 37:31.096
Yeah.

37:31.098 --> 37:33.299
Married, kids?

37:33.301 --> 37:34.168
None of that?

37:35.236 --> 37:36.103
No.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.073
It's a bit difficult.

37:40.075 --> 37:41.576
Is that why she left you?

37:42.477 --> 37:43.579
The demon drink?

37:47.617 --> 37:49.485
Maybe we should
change the subject.

37:50.586 --> 37:53.055
Do you know why they
call it the demon drink?

37:56.393 --> 37:58.060
Because it fucks up your life.

37:59.128 --> 38:01.063
The plot thickens.

38:05.436 --> 38:07.203
Why don't
you just come over here

38:07.205 --> 38:08.706
and enjoy your drink?

38:11.074 --> 38:13.043
He's a little ratty, isn't he?

38:15.547 --> 38:17.480
I have writer's block.

38:17.482 --> 38:18.616
And?

38:20.319 --> 38:21.186
My agent.

38:23.087 --> 38:25.021
He sent me to this
shitty location

38:25.023 --> 38:28.194
and supposedly to inspire me.

38:30.763 --> 38:31.631
Has it?

38:33.332 --> 38:35.332
You've seen what
I've been writing.

38:35.334 --> 38:37.671
Inspiration comes from
all sources, doesn't it?

38:40.106 --> 38:42.273
Look, I don't even
really know your name.

38:42.275 --> 38:43.143
No.

38:52.420 --> 38:53.521
Who are you really?

38:55.390 --> 38:58.257
You haven't followed
rule one, have you?

38:58.259 --> 39:01.294
No, I haven't followed
rule fucking one

39:01.296 --> 39:03.563
because it's a stupid game

39:03.565 --> 39:06.266
and that is a
stupid fucking doll.

39:06.268 --> 39:07.702
Do you know what?

39:07.704 --> 39:10.671
I'm actually gonna finish my
drink and leave this place.

39:10.673 --> 39:12.541
Deadline be damned.

39:13.676 --> 39:14.544
Deadline?

39:15.478 --> 39:19.280
Yeah, my
deadline for my book.

39:19.282 --> 39:21.785
For Alfred the Doll?

39:24.354 --> 39:25.222
Yeah.

39:26.123 --> 39:27.625
So what's happened in the book?

39:29.159 --> 39:31.861
I'll tell you what's
happened in the book.

39:31.863 --> 39:34.429
The writer arrived
at the location,

39:34.431 --> 39:37.702
found the doll, and
ignored the rule.

39:38.837 --> 39:41.103
Matt was concentrating hard,

39:41.105 --> 39:43.507
trying to understand what to do.

39:43.509 --> 39:46.710
Then he heard a knocking
like Edgar Allen Poe,

39:46.712 --> 39:48.446
a knocking at his chamber door.

39:50.883 --> 39:52.449
Yes.

39:52.451 --> 39:53.452
Look, wait.

39:54.787 --> 39:56.755
Then she appeared at the door.

39:56.757 --> 39:59.824
Beautiful, ravishing,
as if chiseled

39:59.826 --> 40:01.628
from the stars themselves.

40:02.896 --> 40:05.129
Little on the nose,
don't you think?

40:05.131 --> 40:06.297
I see how you look at me.

40:06.299 --> 40:07.769
No, no, what are you writing?

40:09.136 --> 40:11.369
She looked at him
square in the eye.

40:11.371 --> 40:12.272
She said...

40:13.174 --> 40:14.609
We should carry out the rule.

40:16.176 --> 40:17.310
Or what?

40:17.312 --> 40:18.479
You don't want to know.

40:20.749 --> 40:21.616
Okay.

40:24.218 --> 40:25.321
Let's fucking do it.

41:16.442 --> 41:18.274
What's happening?

41:18.276 --> 41:19.343
Please, mate.

41:19.345 --> 41:21.412
I need to finish the book.

41:21.414 --> 41:22.548
Have you done it yet?

41:24.817 --> 41:25.686
Yes.

41:26.553 --> 41:28.720
Well, I started to.

41:28.722 --> 41:30.858
Started, but you
haven't finished?

41:32.493 --> 41:33.360
No.

41:36.296 --> 41:38.898
Look, there's this
girl and she...

41:38.900 --> 41:39.768
Girl?

41:41.002 --> 41:41.870
Yeah.

41:43.271 --> 41:44.938
I'm not playing
games here, you know.

41:44.940 --> 41:46.372
Really?

41:46.374 --> 41:47.709
Well, you could fool me.

41:49.712 --> 41:51.714
Have you started
rule number one?

41:55.018 --> 41:55.852
Look, mate.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.822
I think you need to leave.

42:00.890 --> 42:02.757
Henry!

42:02.759 --> 42:03.694
I've gotta go!

42:04.861 --> 42:06.763
What have I told you
about being up here?

42:19.577 --> 42:20.743
Who's that?

42:20.745 --> 42:21.844
Why, this is my daughter.

42:21.846 --> 42:23.715
Who'd you think it is?

42:31.925 --> 42:33.057
What do you think you're doing?

42:33.059 --> 42:35.525
Yeah, what're you doing?

42:35.527 --> 42:37.262
Here, what are you doing?

42:41.633 --> 42:43.236
You stay away from my family.

42:49.577 --> 42:51.478
Stay away from my family.

43:59.852 --> 44:02.787
I'll kill you, you
little bastard.

44:45.501 --> 44:46.368
Cheers.

46:21.973 --> 46:24.707
Brendan, Brendan.

46:32.751 --> 46:33.952
Can you see me?

46:36.188 --> 46:37.556
I can see you!

46:46.631 --> 46:49.236
Do you want to
come out and play?

47:10.591 --> 47:11.259
Mr. Cobbs.

47:13.862 --> 47:15.630
Have you followed rule one?

47:23.172 --> 47:24.040
Yeah.

47:27.076 --> 47:28.142
I have.

47:28.144 --> 47:29.712
You fed him his leaves?

47:34.617 --> 47:35.285
You're fucked.

47:38.155 --> 47:41.892
My son, he followed rule one.

47:45.229 --> 47:46.097
He's gone.

47:48.900 --> 47:50.568
I can't say anymore.

47:51.302 --> 47:52.570
I've said enough.

47:59.644 --> 48:00.846
Wait.

48:03.015 --> 48:04.817
I need to know...

48:07.686 --> 48:08.288
More.

48:09.155 --> 48:11.690
He's your responsibility
now, Mr. Cobbs.

48:12.859 --> 48:13.927
I can do no more.

48:15.396 --> 48:16.863
I've said too much.

49:50.331 --> 49:52.033
So what do you prefer?

49:52.967 --> 49:54.168
Eggs, bacon?

49:55.870 --> 49:56.804
Or leaves?

50:05.981 --> 50:07.914
What the fuck am I doing?

51:10.984 --> 51:12.319
You did this, didn't you?

51:15.957 --> 51:17.025
But why Henry?

51:18.460 --> 51:20.462
Just an innocent tramp.

51:25.200 --> 51:28.504
Alfred, the boy that died.

51:30.139 --> 51:31.206
Who killed you, eh?

51:32.274 --> 51:34.007
Who killed you?

51:34.009 --> 51:35.377
Well, from now on, Alfred,

51:37.180 --> 51:38.214
I'm gonna watch you.

51:39.349 --> 51:43.585
I'm gonna watch you every hour,

51:43.587 --> 51:46.523
every second, and you fuck up,

51:48.626 --> 51:49.593
I'll be there.

51:51.928 --> 51:52.563
Yeah.

51:56.100 --> 51:57.335
You think you got it on me?

51:58.502 --> 51:59.837
I don't think so, mate.

52:10.982 --> 52:14.418
My
daddy's coming to get you.

52:14.420 --> 52:17.223
Do you want to
come out and play?

52:37.612 --> 52:40.946
Do you want to
come out and play?

53:36.443 --> 53:37.310
Brendan.

53:42.583 --> 53:43.450
I'm here.

54:24.328 --> 54:27.129
Do you want to
come out and play?

01:07:19.899 --> 01:07:22.168
Mommy.

01:07:30.977 --> 01:07:31.845
It's time.

01:07:32.512 --> 01:07:34.214
Time to meet your maker.

01:08:22.433 --> 01:08:24.233
Alfred has chosen.

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:27.202
Alfred has chosen.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.703
You will be the sacrifice.

01:08:28.706 --> 01:08:30.974
You will
be the sacrifice.

01:08:30.975 --> 01:08:32.408
You won't be forgotten.

01:08:32.411 --> 01:08:34.644
You won't be forgotten.

01:08:34.645 --> 01:08:37.247
Alfred must feast.

01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:38.584
Alfred must feast.

01:08:40.385 --> 01:08:41.451
And it begins tonight.

01:08:41.453 --> 01:08:43.122
And it begins tonight.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.408
Why sacrifice the ones we love

01:09:05.078 --> 01:09:07.314
when we can sacrifice
the ones we don't know?

01:09:21.095 --> 01:09:23.196
Your book is late.

01:09:23.198 --> 01:09:25.267
Deadlines mean everything.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.042
I just need more time.

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:36.379
Don't worry your little nerves.

01:09:37.514 --> 01:09:39.113
I'll have a ponder
to get back to you

01:09:39.115 --> 01:09:40.183
with my answer.

01:09:48.827 --> 01:09:50.361
Is she the one?

01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:54.531
I'm afraid not.

01:09:54.533 --> 01:09:56.234
We'll have to find someone else.

01:09:57.268 --> 01:09:59.435
But I think I know just the man.

01:09:59.437 --> 01:10:01.471
Should I send her Alfred?

01:10:01.473 --> 01:10:02.840
Make it happen.

01:10:02.842 --> 01:10:05.177
We can't afford to have
any more loose ends.

01:10:24.565 --> 01:10:26.098
Like an hitchhiker.

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:26.865
A writer.

01:10:26.867 --> 01:10:29.270
A man asking for directions.

01:10:33.207 --> 01:10:34.074
Look.

01:10:35.577 --> 01:10:36.645
I don't deserve this.

01:10:37.579 --> 01:10:38.446
Deserve?

01:10:39.781 --> 01:10:41.551
Deserve has nothing
to do with it.

01:10:42.618 --> 01:10:43.719
It's required.

01:11:34.506 --> 01:11:35.609
Please.

01:11:37.811 --> 01:11:39.243
Oh my god!

01:11:39.245 --> 01:11:40.112
No!

01:13:54.793 --> 01:13:59.464
Do you
want to come out and play?

01:13:59.466 --> 01:14:04.466
