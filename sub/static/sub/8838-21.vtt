IT'S GETTING LATE.
GUESS I BETTER RING
THE BELL.

01:39.684 --> 01:41.561
WHAT FOR? YOU'RE
NOT THE TEACHER.

01:41.728 --> 01:44.439
SHE TOLD ME TO ASSEMBLE
THE CLASS IF SHE EVER
HAPPENED TO BE LATE.

01:44.606 --> 01:45.732
I NEVER HEARD HER
SAY THAT.

01:45.899 --> 01:48.568
YOU CAN CHECK WITH HER

01:59.704 --> 02:01.080

NO SCHOOL NOW.

I'VE JUST RECEIVED WORD
FROM MRS. SIMMS

02:03.666 --> 02:06.294
THAT HER SON LUKE
HAS COME DOWN
WITH THE MEASLES.

02:06.461 --> 02:07.295
- WHAT A SHAME.
- YES!

WITH HIS FATHER.

IN ORDER TO KEEP
THE DISEASE
FROM SPREADING,

02:14.135 --> 02:15.470
SHE HAS TO STAY HOME
AND TEND HIM,

02:15.637 --> 02:16.638
WHICH MEANS, OF COURSE,

02:16.805 --> 02:18.598
THAT THERE'S GOING
TO BE NO SCHOOL.

JUST SIT RIGHT HERE

USUALLY DETERIORATE

09:01.959 --> 09:03.377

09:03.544 --> 09:06.255

LIKE YOU TOO MUCH.

09:10.218 --> 09:11.344

MORNING, CHARLES.

10:00.351 --> 10:01.894
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHY THE LONG FACES?

10:02.061 --> 10:03.813
GOOD REASON.

10:03.980 --> 10:05.523
THE RAILROADS
ARE STARTING A WAR.

10:05.690 --> 10:07.775
THE PAPER'S
FULL OF IT.

10:07.942 --> 10:09.986
THEY SAY THEY'RE
GOING TO BUST
THE GRANGES,

10:10.152 --> 10:11.362
AND THEY'RE
OUT TO DO IT.

10:11.529 --> 10:13.072
GOT AHOLD OF
THE MEMBERSHIP LIST.

10:13.239 --> 10:15.950
THEY WON'T EVEN
SHIP ANY FREIGHT FOR
THE MEMBERS OF THE GRANGE.

10:16.117 --> 10:19.370
TRAINS AREN'T
EVEN STOPPING OVER IN
SLEEPY EYE AND SPRINGFIELD.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.205
THERE'S STILL
WAGON FREIGHT.

10:21.372 --> 10:22.707
WON'T DO NO GOOD,
CHARLES.

10:22.873 --> 10:26.585
RAILROADS BOUGHT UP
ALL THE GRAIN ELEVATORS.

10:26.752 --> 10:27.795
EVEN IF WE COULD
SELL A CROP,

10:27.962 --> 10:29.755
THEY WOULDN'T GIVE US
ENOUGH FOR SEED.

10:29.922 --> 10:30.965
YOU CAN'T BEAT
THE RAILROADS

10:31.132 --> 10:32.925
UNLESS THEY WANT YOU
TO BEAT THEM.

10:41.851 --> 10:44.228
CHARLES, YOU'RE GOING TO
WEAR THAT NEWSPAPER OUT.

10:44.395 --> 10:46.939
I KEEP RE-READING IT
LOOKING FOR
SOME RAY OF HOPE.

10:47.106 --> 10:49.900
CAN THE RAILROAD
REFUSE TO HAUL FREIGHT?
IS THAT LEGAL?

10:50.067 --> 10:51.736
LEGAL OR NOT,
THEY'RE DOING IT.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.779
CAN'T THE GRANGE
DO SOMETHING?

10:53.946 --> 10:55.364
SAYS HERE THEY'RE GOING
TO SUE THE RAILROAD.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.824
THERE, YOU SEE?
IT IS ILLEGAL.

10:56.991 --> 10:59.285
AH, THE RAILROAD
WILL FIGHT IT.

10:59.452 --> 11:00.786
SURELY THE GRANGE
WILL WIN.

11:00.953 --> 11:02.246
THERE YOU GO, MARY.

11:02.413 --> 11:04.498
WELL, I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
ABOUT THE GRANGE WINNING.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.292
RAILROAD HAS A LOT
OF MONEY FOR LAWYERS.

11:06.459 --> 11:08.294
THE CASE WON'T GO TO COURT
FOR AT LEAST A YEAR.

11:08.461 --> 11:10.463
A YEAR?
CAN THEY DO THAT?

11:10.629 --> 11:11.672
CAROLINE,
YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY,

11:11.839 --> 11:13.299
YOU CAN DO JUST ABOUT
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

11:17.345 --> 11:18.971
MARY, WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING?

11:20.973 --> 11:22.475
JUST TRYING TO READ.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.852
DO YOU HAVE TO
HAVE YOUR NOSE BURIED
IN THE BOOK LIKE THAT?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.147
SOME SHADOWS
ON THE BOOK.

11:28.314 --> 11:30.775
ARE THOSE
YOUR NEW GLASSES?

11:30.941 --> 11:33.486
YES, BUT THEY'RE
NOT MUCH BETTER
THAN THE OLD ONES.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.821
YOU SAID THEY WERE FINE
WHEN YOU FIRST GOT THEM.

11:35.988 --> 11:38.824
THEY SEEMED TO BE
AT FIRST.

11:38.991 --> 11:42.161
BRAND-NEW PRESCRIPTION.
SHOULD BE BETTER THAN THAT.

11:42.328 --> 11:43.913
EVEN DOCTORS MAKE MISTAKES.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.999
LET'S GET YOU
INTO DR. BURKE--
THE SOONER, THE BETTER.

11:47.166 --> 11:49.001
[BABY CRYING]

11:49.168 --> 11:51.295
SHE CAN'T
BE HUNGRY AGAIN?

11:51.462 --> 11:54.173
HA HA HA!
WHAT AN APPETITE.

11:57.343 --> 12:00.513
NOW LOOK THIS WAY.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.515
NOW STRAIGHT AHEAD.

12:07.311 --> 12:11.816
GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T
COME IN LAST WEEK.

12:11.982 --> 12:15.027
I WAS DOWN
WITH A SORE THROAT.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.612
NO. DON'T LOOK AT ME.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.072
KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THE WALL.

12:25.371 --> 12:26.539
MISERABLE FEELING.

12:33.212 --> 12:36.173
HOW ABOUT YOU?

12:36.340 --> 12:39.343
ANY, UH...ILLNESSES?

12:39.510 --> 12:41.053
BAD ONES, I MEAN.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.639
I HAD AN OPERATION ONCE.
IT WAS AWFUL--

12:43.806 --> 12:45.516
EVEN WORSE THAN WHEN
I HAD SCARLET FEVER.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.438
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD SCARLET FEVER.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.731
IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.483
HOW ABOUT MY EYES?

12:54.650 --> 12:56.068
DID YOU
FIND ANYTHING?

12:56.235 --> 12:58.028
THERE HAVE
BEEN SOME CHANGES.

12:58.195 --> 13:01.490
TELL YOU WHAT.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOUR PA.

13:01.657 --> 13:02.533
JUST TAKE A MINUTE.

13:02.700 --> 13:03.909
I'LL GET HIM.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.623
PA, THE DOCTOR
WANTS TO SEE YOU.

13:09.790 --> 13:10.916
ALL RIGHT.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.713
DOCTOR.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.424
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.390
HOW IS SHE?

13:26.557 --> 13:30.561
I DIDN'T KNOW YOUR
DAUGHTER HAD SCARLET
FEVER, MR. INGALLS.

13:33.481 --> 13:36.233
SHE'S--SHE'S HAD
SCARLET FEVER, YEAH.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.651
HOW BAD WAS IT?

13:41.780 --> 13:43.657
IT WAS BAD.
IT WAS SCARLET FEVER.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.034
WHAT IS IT?

13:45.201 --> 13:49.121
WELL, THE FEVER
DAMAGED THE NERVES,
WEAKENED THEM.

13:54.210 --> 13:57.087
HOW LONG
TILL SHE'S BETTER?

13:57.254 --> 14:00.090
WELL, HER EYES
WON'T GET BETTER.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.009
THE CONDITION
ONLY WORSENS.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.638
MR. INGALLS...

14:08.390 --> 14:10.142
MARY IS GOING BLIND.

14:25.824 --> 14:29.954
THERE MUST--
THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.122
I'M AFRAID NOT.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.667
I WISH THERE
WAS SOME MEDICINE

14:34.833 --> 14:37.336
OR TREATMENT
THAT WOULD HELP,

14:37.503 --> 14:38.587
BUT THERE ISN'T.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.140
THERE IS...

14:52.935 --> 14:54.520
SOME--

14:54.687 --> 14:57.356
SOMETHING.
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING.

14:57.523 --> 14:59.900
IT WOULD HAVE TO
BE IN THE NATURE
OF A MIRACLE,

15:00.067 --> 15:03.028
BEYOND THE
KNOWLEDGE OR SKILL
OF A DOCTOR.

15:12.288 --> 15:13.080
NO.

15:13.247 --> 15:16.125
UH...NO,
SEE, YOU'RE WRONG.

15:16.292 --> 15:17.668
IT ISN'T THAT.
IT'S...

15:20.504 --> 15:22.881
IT'S THAT
MY DAUGHTER'S BEEN...

15:23.048 --> 15:25.342
SHE'S--SHE'S BEEN
READING A LOT.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.219
SHE'S BEEN STUDYING.
SHE WANTS...

15:29.847 --> 15:32.224
SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER.

15:32.391 --> 15:36.395
AND...AND HER EYES ARE...

15:36.562 --> 15:39.189
HER EYES ARE TIRED.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.943
REST MIGHT HELP,
BUT NOT MUCH...

15:43.110 --> 15:45.446
NOT FOR LONG.

15:45.613 --> 15:46.739
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

15:48.657 --> 15:54.538
FOR MARY'S SAKE,
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT
THE FACTS.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.790
SHE HASN'T GOT
MUCH TIME LEFT.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.417
[SOBBING]

15:58.584 --> 16:01.378
SHE'LL DESPERATELY
NEED YOUR HELP
AND SUPPORT.

16:17.436 --> 16:20.439
HERE. THIS...

16:20.606 --> 16:21.857
IS A READING GLASS.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.486
IT MIGHT HELP
FOR A WHILE.

16:42.753 --> 16:43.837
YOU'RE WRONG.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.967
THAT DIDN'T
TAKE LONG, DID IT?

16:49.134 --> 16:49.968
WHAT DID HE SAY?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.428
OH, NOTHING.
NOTHING IMPORTANT.

16:51.595 --> 16:52.805
WHAT ABOUT
MY NEW GLASSES?

16:52.971 --> 16:54.306
HE SAID
IT'S JUST EYE STRAIN

16:54.473 --> 16:56.642
AND GAVE ME
A LITTLE GLASS
THAT'LL HELP YOU.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.686
REST YOUR EYES,
YOU'LL BE
FEELING FINE SOON.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.232
THANK YOU AGAIN,
DOCTOR.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.187
- HI.
- HI.

17:44.273 --> 17:46.775
THEY'RE ALL IN BED.

17:46.942 --> 17:50.195
MARY WAS EXHAUSTED.

17:50.362 --> 17:52.281
YOU MUST BE TIRED.

17:52.448 --> 17:53.657
AH, JUST
A LITTLE BIT.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.454
HONEY, I...

17:58.620 --> 18:00.998
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU.

18:01.165 --> 18:02.207
WHAT ABOUT?

18:05.419 --> 18:08.088
JUST ABOUT
MARY'S EYES.

18:11.049 --> 18:15.220
YOU AND MARY SAID
THAT IT WAS JUST
EYE STRAIN.

18:15.387 --> 18:18.098
I KNOW. I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING
TO MARY ABOUT IT,

18:19.391 --> 18:20.642
BUT...

18:22.644 --> 18:23.729
DR. BURKE THINKS THAT--

18:23.896 --> 18:25.689
THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET
A LITTLE BIT WORSE.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.818
HOW MUCH WORSE?

18:34.239 --> 18:35.657
HE THINKS...

18:38.243 --> 18:40.287
- WHAT?
- HE THINKS THAT

18:40.454 --> 18:42.247
SHE'S GONNA BE BLIND.

18:42.414 --> 18:46.794
WHAT? OH! OH!

18:46.960 --> 18:48.170
- SHH.
- NO.

18:48.337 --> 18:51.632
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

18:51.799 --> 18:53.425
I WANT YOU TO
LISTEN TO ME, NOW.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.302
I DROVE HER HOME
IN THE WAGON

18:55.469 --> 18:57.471
AND SHE TALKED ABOUT
THE SKY AND THE BIRDS

18:57.638 --> 19:01.183
AND I THINK
HE'S WRONG.

19:01.350 --> 19:03.560
- HE'S WRONG.
- WHAT IF HE'S RIGHT?

19:03.727 --> 19:04.770
HE IS WRONG.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.524
OH! OH! [SOBBING]

19:08.690 --> 19:11.610
HE'S PROBABLY WRONG.
SHH.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.407
HE'S WRONG.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.618
OH, MY.

19:40.806 --> 19:41.890
MORNING, CHARLES.

19:44.685 --> 19:45.978
WHOA!

19:46.144 --> 19:48.313
MISSED YOU
AT THE GRANGE MEETING,
LAST NIGHT.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.566
YEAH, WELL, I WASN'T
FEELING TOO WELL.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.776
KIND OF BEEN
OFF YOUR FEET
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

19:52.943 --> 19:54.653
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

19:54.820 --> 19:55.946
NO, NO.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

19:56.113 --> 19:57.573
HOW'D THE MEETING GO?

19:57.739 --> 20:02.244
WELL, WE GOT
THE NATIONAL REPORTS,
AND IT DON'T LOOK GOOD.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.620
RAILROADS WON'T BUDGE...

20:03.787 --> 20:07.291
AND I DON'T SEE
HOW WE CAN
STAND UP TO THEM.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.043
THEY GOT THE MONEY,
AND WE DON'T.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.796
SOME FOLKS IS GOING
BELLY UP ALREADY, CHARLES.

20:12.963 --> 20:15.507
SPRAGUE'S PUTTING
THE BANK UP FOR SALE.

20:15.674 --> 20:18.468
SAID HE DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS GOING TO GET
ANY OFFERS, BUT...

20:18.635 --> 20:20.762
HE'S GOING
TO DO IT ANYWAY.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.514
WHAT IF
HE DOESN'T SELL IT?

20:22.681 --> 20:25.058
WELL, THEY WON'T
OPERATE AT A LOSS ANYMORE.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.185
HE'LL JUST
CLOSE IT DOWN.

20:29.771 --> 20:33.150
TOWN'LL NEVER MAKE IT
WITHOUT A BANK.

20:33.317 --> 20:35.903
I KNOW.

20:36.069 --> 20:40.699
WELL, AT LEAST WE GOT
A FEW MORE ORDERS
COMING IN AT THE MILL.

20:40.866 --> 20:43.952
A LITTLE BIT
OF MONEY COMING, BUT...

20:44.119 --> 20:46.997
AFTER THAT,
I--I THINK IT'S GOING
TO TAKE A MIRACLE.

20:52.377 --> 20:55.213
I SUPPOSE.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.590
I'LL SEE YA
AT THE MILL, ALL RIGHT?

21:21.740 --> 21:25.077
WOMEN'S WORK DONE?

21:25.243 --> 21:26.870
LAURA'S FINISHING UP
THE DISHES.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.253
I COULD BE MENDING
OR DARNING.

21:40.926 --> 21:43.136
I THOUGHT
I'D JUST COME OUT HERE
AND BE LAZY WITH YOU.

21:45.722 --> 21:50.644
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LAZY? I'M REFINISHING
THIS SHUTTER.

21:50.811 --> 21:52.187
EVEN THOUGH
IT DOESN'T NEED IT.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.609
BEEN 3 WEEKS.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.948
SHE'S GETTING WORSE,
ISN'T SHE?

22:05.534 --> 22:06.618
YES.

22:08.286 --> 22:09.579
[GLASS BREAKS]

22:09.746 --> 22:11.081
Laura: PA! FIRE!

22:14.001 --> 22:15.419
CAROLINE,
GET A BLANKET!

22:15.585 --> 22:16.670
NO WATER!

22:23.635 --> 22:25.345
I GOT IT.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.222
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.391
Mary: I'M SORRY.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.643
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
NO HARM DONE.

22:31.810 --> 22:32.936
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

22:34.479 --> 22:36.690
I WAS TRYING TO READ,

22:36.857 --> 22:39.484
BUT IT SEEMED
SO DARK IN HERE.

22:39.651 --> 22:42.904
I WENT TO GET
ANOTHER LAMP.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.197
I DROPPED IT.

22:46.783 --> 22:50.662
I THINK YOU'VE
BEEN WORKING
TOO MUCH,

22:50.829 --> 22:53.665
USING YOUR EYES.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.459
THEY DO KIND OF ACHE.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.044
HOW ABOUT
A COOL CLOTH?

22:59.296 --> 23:01.590
NO, I--I BETTER
JUST GO TO BED.

23:06.511 --> 23:09.014
I AM SORRY.

23:09.181 --> 23:11.141
OH, I TOLD YOU,
NO HARM DONE.

23:11.308 --> 23:12.517
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.394
WE'LL CLEAN IT UP.
YOU GO ON, GET SOME SLEEP.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.191
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MARY.

23:22.152 --> 23:23.945
LAURA, WE'LL
NEED A MOP.

23:24.112 --> 23:26.448
ME AGAIN? MARY GETS TO
DO ANYTHING SHE WANTS,

23:26.615 --> 23:27.657
AND I HAVE TO DO
ALL THE WORK!

23:27.824 --> 23:29.367
YOUR MOTHER TOLD YOU
TO GET A MOP!

23:40.921 --> 23:42.714
CARRIE, YOU GO ON,
GET BACK IN BED NOW.

23:42.881 --> 23:44.549
MAMA WILL BE IN
TO KISS YOU GOOD NIGHT.

23:59.940 --> 24:03.193
IT'S HAPPENING
SO FAST.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.402
I KNOW.

24:07.447 --> 24:10.826
I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO TELL HER.

24:10.992 --> 24:13.745
DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO IT?

24:13.912 --> 24:14.955
NO.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.416
I'LL TELL HER
TOMORROW.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.170
Reverend: CHARLES?

25:08.425 --> 25:09.885
I DON'T MEAN TO INTRUDE.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.181
I WAS JUST GETTING
THE CHURCH READY
FOR SERVICE TOMORROW.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.334
DR. BAKER TOLD ME.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.379
IS THERE
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

25:50.508 --> 25:51.927
I PRAY AND I PRAY.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.265
WHY DOESN'T GOD
LISTEN?

25:59.768 --> 26:01.144
HE LISTENS, CHARLES.

26:03.647 --> 26:05.315
AND HE ALWAYS ANSWERS
OUR PRAYERS.

26:07.067 --> 26:11.154
HE DOESN'T
ALWAYS ANSWER...

26:11.321 --> 26:14.574
IN A WAY THAT WE WANT,

26:14.741 --> 26:17.202
BUT IN A WAY THAT HE THINKS
IS BEST FOR EACH OF US.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.209
HOW CAN TAKING
THE SIGHT FROM
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL

26:24.376 --> 26:26.753
BE THE BEST THING
FOR HER?

26:26.920 --> 26:28.338
WE'RE ONLY FINITE.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.801
HE'S INFINITE IN HIS WISDOM.

26:36.846 --> 26:39.599
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU
THAT THERE IS A REASON.

26:43.228 --> 26:44.479
CHARLES, BELIEVE ME...

26:47.816 --> 26:49.150
GOD MUST HAVE CHOSEN MARY

26:49.317 --> 26:52.821
FOR SOME
VERY SPECIAL PURPOSE.

26:58.410 --> 26:59.703
TOMORROW, I HAVE
TO TELL MY DAUGHTER

26:59.869 --> 27:01.329
THAT
SHE'S GOING BLIND.

27:09.671 --> 27:12.007
WHAT SHOULD
I TELL HER IS THAT
SPECIAL PURPOSE?

27:36.823 --> 27:39.409
STUDYING OUT HERE?

27:39.576 --> 27:41.161
IT'S A LITTLE EASIER
IN THE SUNSHINE.

27:43.788 --> 27:44.873
I SUPPOSE SO.

27:49.544 --> 27:53.006
YOU'RE WORRYING
ABOUT THE RAILROAD,
AREN'T YOU, PA?

27:53.173 --> 27:54.257
NO.

27:56.676 --> 27:59.137
I KNOW IT'S BAD.

27:59.304 --> 28:02.474
SETH AND HIS PA
WENT TO SLEEPY EYE.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.727
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY
TO OPEN A LIVERY THERE.

28:05.894 --> 28:07.854
THEY FIGURE THE FARMERS
ARE REALLY GOING TO SUFFER.

28:11.358 --> 28:12.484
WE CAN ALWAYS
MAKE DO.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.154
DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.533
I KNOW SOMETHING'S
BOTHERING YOU.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.249
I WANTED TO...

28:34.214 --> 28:35.590
I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.682
SEE, YOUR
MOTHER AND I HAVE
BEEN HOPING...

28:49.354 --> 28:51.022
AND, UH...

28:51.189 --> 28:52.524
PRAYING, BUT IT WAS
THE SCARLET FEVER,

28:52.690 --> 28:54.901
AND IT WEAKENED THE
NERVES IN YOUR EYES.

29:00.365 --> 29:03.868
IT'LL GET BETTER,
WON'T IT, PA?

29:04.035 --> 29:05.537
MY EYES WILL BE
ALL RIGHT AGAIN.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.171
THE DOCTOR THINKS
IT'LL GET WORSE.

29:18.633 --> 29:19.676
AND, UH...

29:24.013 --> 29:25.849
PA?

29:26.015 --> 29:27.058
HE, UH...

29:33.356 --> 29:35.191
HE FEELS THAT...

29:35.358 --> 29:38.069
YOU--YOU'RE
GRADUALLY GOING
TO LOSE YOUR SIGHT.

29:47.912 --> 29:48.955
BLIND?

[MARY SOBBING]

31:15.458 --> 31:17.752
MR. GARVEY,

HE'S NOT OPEN YET.

31:20.755 --> 31:22.882

31:23.049 --> 31:25.885
OH. I'VE BEEN

31:31.849 --> 31:34.435
I'M SHUTTING
THE MILL DOWN NOW.

31:34.602 --> 31:37.855
KIND OF KNEW IT WOULD
HAPPEN, BUT NOT THIS QUICK.

31:38.022 --> 31:39.816

31:39.983 --> 31:42.026
NO, HE HASN'T
BEEN IN TOWN MUCH

31:42.193 --> 31:44.112
FOR THE LAST
LITTLE WHILE.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.573
I THINK I'LL GO OUT
AND TELL HIM THE GOOD NEWS.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.408
PA AND ME GOT US
A LIVERY IN SLEEPY EYE.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.535

SETH, YOU KNOW
ABOUT MARY, DON'T YOU?

32:00.003 --> 32:02.046
KNOW--KNOW WHAT?

32:02.213 --> 32:04.173
ABOUT HER EYES.

32:04.340 --> 32:09.220
OH, YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW
THEY'VE BEEN BOTHERING HER.

OUT TO YOUR PLACE.

33:11.908 --> 33:13.451
THE MILL'S CLOSED DOWN.

33:13.618 --> 33:17.246

A TRIP IF YOU WAS
PLANNING ON COMING IN.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.458
THANKS.

33:23.461 --> 33:24.420

33:40.144 --> 33:44.232
THE MILL WAS SHUT DOWN,

33:44.399 --> 33:46.526
I'D BE THE MOST UPSET
MAN YOU EVER SAW.

33:49.737 --> 33:51.698
NOW I DON'T EVEN CARE.
IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING.

33:56.369 --> 33:57.453
I JUST WONDER...

34:00.665 --> 34:01.874
HOW MUCH OF OUR LIVES
ARE SPENT WORRYING

34:02.041 --> 34:04.252
ABOUT THINGS
THAT JUST DON'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.051
IF THERE IS ANYTHING,

36:08.376 --> 36:11.087
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, DOCTOR.

36:11.254 --> 36:15.091
SHE SAYS SHE'S A BURDEN
TO US AND SHE HATES IT.

36:15.258 --> 36:18.469
WE TELL HER
IT ISN'T TRUE, BUT IT
DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD.

36:18.636 --> 36:19.971
Baker: NOW, THIS MAY
SOUND HARSH, CAROLINE,

36:20.137 --> 36:23.015
BUT I THINK YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.892
SHE HAS TO LEARN
TO DO FOR HERSELF

36:25.059 --> 36:26.727
IF SHE'S TO HAVE
ANY KIND OF LIFE.

36:26.894 --> 36:28.145
SHE CAN'T DO
FOR HERSELF, DOCTOR.

36:28.312 --> 36:29.897
WE HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF HER.

36:30.064 --> 36:31.607
YOU DO TOO MUCH,
AND SHE'LL RETREAT TO BED,

36:31.774 --> 36:34.443
AND SHE'LL STAY THERE.

IN THE CARE OF THE BLIND.
NEITHER HAVE YOU.

36:38.656 --> 36:42.660
SHE NEEDS THE HELP
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE.

36:42.827 --> 36:44.579
WHERE DO WE FIND
THOSE PEOPLE?

36:44.745 --> 36:46.622
THERE ARE SCHOOLS
FOR THE BLIND.

36:46.789 --> 36:50.167
THE NEAREST,
ONE OF THE BEST,
IS IN BURTON, IOWA.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.003
SO FAR AWAY?

HER FAMILY.

IN FEAR AND RESENTMENT NOW.
