00:18.328 --> 00:20.119
And that's why
you don't scream

00:20.194 --> 00:21.530
while sinking
in quicksand.

00:21.597 --> 00:23.709
Webby, please
don't tell me how to die.

00:23.803 --> 00:24.959
Don't worry.

00:25.045 --> 00:27.100
I've read all about
the ancient pyramids.

00:27.189 --> 00:28.678
I'll show you
the ins and outs.

00:29.217 --> 00:31.327
Would love
to focus on the outs.

00:34.434 --> 00:35.520
I was right!

00:35.615 --> 00:39.155
The tomb of Toth-Ra,
Bringer of the Sun.

00:39.405 --> 00:41.325
I've been searching
for decades and...

00:41.778 --> 00:42.867
Launchpad!

00:42.924 --> 00:45.584
Mm.
Did you want a bite?

00:45.817 --> 00:47.725
This is the last
of the lost pyramids.

00:47.783 --> 00:49.719
Show some respect.

00:53.664 --> 00:55.147
Sorry, Mr. McD.

00:55.475 --> 00:56.545
Oh, man!

00:56.603 --> 00:58.654
What if there's a whole army
of mummies down here?

00:58.712 --> 01:00.242
Unlikely.
Mummification was

01:00.300 --> 01:02.186
an expensive process
meant for royalty.

01:02.276 --> 01:04.421
It'd be rare for
more than one mummy...

01:04.647 --> 01:05.842
Toth-Ra was pretty rich.

01:05.939 --> 01:07.149
I bet there's
at least six.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.608
Rich?
What are we talking?

01:08.679 --> 01:09.928
Jewels, antiquities, what?

01:09.986 --> 01:11.952
Pharaohs from this period
were typically entombed

01:12.010 --> 01:14.420
with treasure, servants,
jars full of vital organs.

01:14.478 --> 01:16.709
Ignoring the bad parts.
See you in the treasure room.

01:16.794 --> 01:18.072
Wee!

01:18.218 --> 01:19.342
Careful!

01:26.341 --> 01:28.212
That was pretty
anti-climactic.

01:40.299 --> 01:41.565
Whoa!

01:42.029 --> 01:43.046
Oh, ow!

01:43.104 --> 01:44.213
What?

01:47.693 --> 01:48.821
Mummies!

01:48.889 --> 01:50.730
Behind me.
They could be dangerous.

01:50.804 --> 01:53.858
Speak,
you ancient miscreants!

01:55.008 --> 01:56.590

Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Living Mummies of Toth-Ra!"</font>

02:56.270 --> 02:58.308
Hey, if those are mummies
I'd hate to see daddies,

02:58.365 --> 03:02.052
- am I right?
- Greetings, minions of Toth-Ra!

03:02.110 --> 03:04.537
We are Scrooge McDuck
and family.

03:04.628 --> 03:05.951
Hey, if you guys are mummies,

03:06.009 --> 03:08.775
- then I'd hate to see...
- And associates

03:08.833 --> 03:10.452
from the outside.

03:11.258 --> 03:12.356
Outsiders.

03:12.428 --> 03:13.755
We mean you no harm.

03:13.813 --> 03:15.108
If you could just
show us where your

03:15.165 --> 03:16.381
- sacred treasure room is?
- Oh, shh, shh, shh.

03:16.438 --> 03:17.818
You'll forgive the lad.

03:17.876 --> 03:19.278
We're just used
to the mummies

03:19.336 --> 03:22.613
in pyramids being,
well, eh, dead.

03:27.368 --> 03:28.973
We are not mummies.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.716
We merely dress
in this manner

03:30.774 --> 03:33.623
to honor our powerful
and fashion-forward leader.

03:33.841 --> 03:36.576
I am Amunet,
leader of the descendants

03:36.685 --> 03:38.513
of the servants
of Pharaoh Toth-Ra.

03:38.571 --> 03:39.734
For thousands of years,

03:39.792 --> 03:41.258
our families have
served the pharaoh.

03:41.316 --> 03:42.922
And our society
has thrived.

03:48.259 --> 03:49.720
I give you good deal.
Buy my sand.

03:49.778 --> 03:51.141
Buy my sand.
Buy from me!

03:51.208 --> 03:52.406
Aah!

03:52.473 --> 03:54.250
"Thrived" isn't the word
I'd use.

03:54.308 --> 03:56.337
Living mummies.
There's something

03:56.395 --> 03:57.946
you don't see every day,
eh, Webbigail?

03:58.079 --> 03:59.977
Webby? Louie?!

04:01.009 --> 04:02.797
They must've gone
down the other chute.

04:02.855 --> 04:06.148
Into the pharaoh's
forbidden chamber!

04:06.221 --> 04:07.376
- Forbidden?
- Oh, no!

04:07.434 --> 04:08.508
Lucky!

04:08.566 --> 04:09.675
The poor bairns

04:09.733 --> 04:11.814
must be scared
out of their wits!

04:12.019 --> 04:13.573
Wee!

04:17.233 --> 04:19.320
Are we dead?
Oh, is this heaven?

04:19.396 --> 04:21.672
The ruby ankh
of Neferhotep!

04:21.730 --> 04:24.148
The ushabti army
of Xerxes the third!

04:24.562 --> 04:25.969
A prophecy!

04:26.250 --> 04:29.734
"To those who serve
the Pharaoh Toth-Ra,

04:29.792 --> 04:31.687
he brings golden reward,

04:31.735 --> 04:34.352
but beware all those
who cross him."

04:34.523 --> 04:36.529
And then something
I can't quite translate.

04:36.596 --> 04:38.134
Something about a curse?

04:38.201 --> 04:39.750
Being stuck here
for all eternity?

04:39.810 --> 04:41.039
Fine by me!

04:41.825 --> 04:43.372
Mm, best not to
touch anything

04:43.430 --> 04:44.695
until we find Mr. McDuck.

04:44.799 --> 04:47.500
- Let's go.
- Or maybe we stay here.

04:47.602 --> 04:49.055
It's a room
full of treasure.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.641
Scroogey's gonna find it.

04:50.852 --> 04:53.255
Good thinking.
Still, don't touch...

04:53.322 --> 04:55.594
Well, hello.

04:56.414 --> 04:57.781
Anything.

04:58.891 --> 05:00.106
And that's my hut,

05:00.173 --> 05:01.797
and that's a public
waste hole.

05:02.086 --> 05:03.435
They're awful close
to each other.

05:03.502 --> 05:05.201
It does not
smell great,

05:05.268 --> 05:08.695
but Almighty Toth-Ra decreed
this is where I am to live.

05:09.289 --> 05:11.882
Oh, and here's the
Temple of Toth-Ra.

05:14.017 --> 05:15.411
See here, Amunet.

05:15.469 --> 05:16.664
My kids are trapped.

05:16.722 --> 05:18.901
Now you take me
to the pharaoh this instant.

05:18.968 --> 05:22.115
No need. The pharaoh
will be here soon.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.625
Bless me bagpipes.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.624
Your pharaoh is...

05:44.967 --> 05:46.573
pleased.

05:47.069 --> 05:49.413
He has accepted
our offering.

05:49.569 --> 05:52.249
It is time for
our golden reward.

05:52.366 --> 05:54.226
I give you

05:54.293 --> 05:55.933
the Sun!

05:57.336 --> 05:58.629
Aah!

06:05.659 --> 06:07.500
- That's it?
- Wait!

06:09.122 --> 06:10.757
Get back here!

06:14.874 --> 06:16.409
Great day, everyone.

06:16.467 --> 06:19.816
If we skip meals
and start harvesting right now,

06:19.883 --> 06:23.069
maybe he'll bring us
a full hour of sun tomorrow.

06:23.136 --> 06:25.862
You know a mummy doesn't actually
bring you the sun, right?

06:25.929 --> 06:27.399
The Earth spins
on its axis, creating...

06:27.456 --> 06:30.657
Aww, not the sharpest sickle
in the shed, are you, kid?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.198
I got a Junior Woodchuck badge

06:32.265 --> 06:34.402
in sickle sharpening
that says otherwise.

06:34.996 --> 06:36.999
- You should
really leave that alone.

06:37.132 --> 06:38.530
Basic rule of
treasure hunting:

06:38.597 --> 06:40.797
If it might be cursed,
don't touch it.

06:40.897 --> 06:43.445
You said you weren't sure
what the prophecy meant.

06:43.512 --> 06:45.828
No, but I am sure it said
the golden reward

06:45.895 --> 06:47.740
is for those
who serve Toth-Ra.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.556
I am serving him...
by cleaning up.

06:50.623 --> 06:52.979
This place is a mess
of treasure.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.394
I don't know.

06:54.452 --> 06:55.998
- Maybe we better...
- Ooh!

06:56.065 --> 06:59.217
What's in this
weird jar, huh?

07:03.967 --> 07:05.297
Do not look
in those jars.

07:05.364 --> 07:07.233
Ooh, a kidney!

07:07.835 --> 07:08.928
Intruders!

07:09.186 --> 07:11.312
We brought that kidney
from home, I swear!

07:11.370 --> 07:14.944
Let me in,
you decomposing degenerate!

07:15.188 --> 07:17.569
Those who enter
the pharaoh's chamber

07:17.710 --> 07:19.045
never return!

07:19.112 --> 07:20.376
- What?
- Oh, no!

07:20.443 --> 07:21.502
Louie! Webby!

07:21.560 --> 07:22.669
Sorry. Too much?

07:22.736 --> 07:24.929
Isn't there some way
you can help us?

07:25.225 --> 07:27.133
I suppose
we could just rise up

07:27.200 --> 07:28.634
against the
all-powerful Toth-Ra,

07:28.701 --> 07:30.542
bringer of the golden Sun.

07:30.599 --> 07:32.164
Yes, that!
Do that!

07:32.231 --> 07:34.470
Why?
We've got food, water,

07:34.537 --> 07:36.328
fresh bandages
in lieu of pay,

07:36.395 --> 07:38.524
a kind and merciful god-king.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.850
What's the outside got
that we don't?

07:40.908 --> 07:43.163
Toth-Ra has got you working
night and day,

07:43.336 --> 07:45.231
but you barely got enough
to scrape by.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.638
He doesn't
bring you the sun.

07:46.705 --> 07:48.736
He keeps it from you!

07:49.444 --> 07:51.988
Sorry, it's just not our way.

07:52.108 --> 07:55.077
Don't you want to feel
the sun on your face?

07:56.535 --> 07:57.632
Meh.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.639
The wind in your hair?

07:59.697 --> 08:00.777
Not really.

08:00.835 --> 08:02.890
Don't you want freedom,
or glory?

08:03.026 --> 08:04.406
Launchpad!

08:04.473 --> 08:05.882
Oh, sorry.

08:05.940 --> 08:07.280
I didn't want
my belly to grumble

08:07.338 --> 08:08.903
and interrupt
your big speech.

08:08.978 --> 08:10.847
Like I am right now.

08:10.914 --> 08:12.598
It's bad enough
you goof around

08:12.665 --> 08:15.577
during the greatest
archaeological find of our time.

08:15.644 --> 08:17.069
But, eh...

08:17.663 --> 08:19.983
Oh, what is that?

08:20.335 --> 08:21.491
Oh, this burrito?

08:21.561 --> 08:24.225
Just rice, beans, cheese,
your choice of meat

08:24.397 --> 08:26.077
wrapped in a
delicious tortilla.

08:26.233 --> 08:29.011
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Delicious!

08:29.078 --> 08:33.318
Oh, where do we get
this bo-rrito?

08:33.385 --> 08:36.322
Outside where freedom is.

08:36.489 --> 08:38.745
Bo-rritos are outside?

08:38.812 --> 08:40.732
We must have bo-rritos!

08:40.864 --> 08:43.589
Rise up against
the mighty Toth-Ra!

08:43.655 --> 08:46.247
Seriously, that's what...
Oh, never mind.

08:46.345 --> 08:48.160
Let's break into the temple!

08:48.329 --> 08:50.243
Yeah, burritos!

08:53.166 --> 08:55.221
Never should've
ignored a prophecy.

08:55.288 --> 08:57.619
We crossed the pharaoh
and now we're doomed!

08:57.686 --> 09:00.266
Silence! -Aah! But we
didn't cross the pharaoh.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.739
It was just
some lowly guard.

09:01.879 --> 09:03.399
Feels like a technicality.

09:03.466 --> 09:04.626
As long as you could talk,

09:04.693 --> 09:06.008
you could talk
your way out.

09:06.075 --> 09:07.353
Trademark: Louie Duck.

09:07.420 --> 09:08.480
I don't know,
this whole thing

09:08.537 --> 09:10.156
is a silly mistake.

09:10.223 --> 09:12.666
You were stealing treasure.

09:13.057 --> 09:15.161
I would never!

09:15.293 --> 09:16.518
I'm a new pharaoh in town.

09:16.585 --> 09:18.286
Maybe you've
heard of me?

09:18.490 --> 09:20.676
Lou-Rai,
master of all pharaohs.

09:20.814 --> 09:22.387
Basically, your boss' boss.

09:22.528 --> 09:24.809
You should just let us go
before I get angry.

09:24.938 --> 09:26.108
He'll never buy that.

09:26.175 --> 09:28.957
Pharaoh of pharaohs, huh?

09:29.911 --> 09:32.508
There shall be none
above Toth-Ra!

09:33.758 --> 09:36.520
Into the pit
of eternal screams.

09:36.699 --> 09:38.700
I never thought I'd die
in a pit of spikes.

09:38.801 --> 09:40.245
I mean, I always hoped.

09:40.359 --> 09:43.479
Prepare to scream eternally!

09:43.537 --> 09:44.787
Or until you hit the bottom.

09:44.942 --> 09:46.798
Wait a second!
You can't do that

09:46.856 --> 09:49.195
because because I have
a really good reason...

09:49.262 --> 09:50.651
and my reason is this...

09:50.709 --> 09:52.134
Because
you've got to perform

09:52.201 --> 09:53.928
the proper ceremony first.

09:54.358 --> 09:56.339
I don't see any
mummification tools,

09:56.397 --> 09:57.453
no book of the dead.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.641
Are you even
a certified high priest?

09:59.708 --> 10:01.117
Well, no, but I...

10:01.184 --> 10:03.565
There has to be a high priest
in attendance.

10:03.632 --> 10:05.581
Everyone knows that.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.582
Wh...
I definitely knew that.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.191
Just check the scroll
if you don't believe us.

10:12.365 --> 10:14.996
- Bye!
- Hey!

10:15.748 --> 10:16.915
Wow, that was quick thinking

10:16.973 --> 10:18.371
on that phony
sacrifice stuff.

10:18.465 --> 10:19.846
Oh, that was all real.

10:19.913 --> 10:22.084
Wait, you were trying
to help him kill us?

10:22.151 --> 10:24.877
If I'm gonna be sacrificed
I'm gonna do it right.

10:24.944 --> 10:27.301
Pretenders,
get back here!

10:32.777 --> 10:34.610
At least my thing helped.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.133
Every time
you ignore the rules

10:36.191 --> 10:38.571
and "pull a Louie",
we end up in more trouble.

10:38.629 --> 10:39.829
Because the rules
of this place

10:39.887 --> 10:41.727
are nonsense like this.

10:41.785 --> 10:44.355
Bird, bird, different
bird, snake, leaf.

10:44.413 --> 10:45.451
Nonsense!

10:45.518 --> 10:47.109
Just because
you don't understand it

10:47.176 --> 10:48.650
doesn't mean it's...
Huh.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.907
Actually,
this doesn't make sense.

10:50.965 --> 10:53.191
This bird is facing
the wrong way.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.659
Secret passage! Yes!

11:00.533 --> 11:01.968
All right, troops.

11:02.035 --> 11:03.179
It won't be easy,

11:03.246 --> 11:04.640
but we'll whip you into shape.

11:04.707 --> 11:05.747
Defeat that gauze-wrapped

11:05.814 --> 11:07.269
reprobate Toth-Ra,

11:07.340 --> 11:09.510
and save Louie and Webby.

11:09.568 --> 11:11.855
Show 'em what
we got, boys!

11:14.839 --> 11:16.064
Good, good.

11:16.139 --> 11:17.509
Work on that
shamble, Horus.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.075
Nice groan, Seth.

11:19.142 --> 11:21.247
- What is this?
- What's more terrifying

11:21.314 --> 11:23.355
than an army of mummies
limping towards you?

11:23.431 --> 11:25.941
You realize
Toth-Ra is a mummy.

11:28.895 --> 11:30.265
Ugh.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.082
All right,
back to one, people.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.202
New strategy.

11:33.262 --> 11:35.871
What do you know
about Frankensteins?

11:36.361 --> 11:38.449
And then we come at Toth-Ra
from both sides.

11:38.507 --> 11:40.590
But... what about
his laser beam eyes?

11:40.668 --> 11:42.082
You've seen
these laser eyes?

11:42.152 --> 11:44.316
No, but he is
all-powerful.

11:44.394 --> 11:47.313
Fine, we cause a diversion
and sneak around back.

11:47.380 --> 11:49.291
But his scarab spies
will tell him we're coming.

11:49.358 --> 11:50.922
Since when does he
have scarab spies?

11:50.989 --> 11:52.384
Since whenever he wants

11:52.451 --> 11:53.980
for he is Toth-Ra,

11:54.047 --> 11:55.847
the almighty,
all-powerful...

11:55.914 --> 11:57.679
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I get it.

11:58.831 --> 12:00.866
One, two, three, and four,

12:00.933 --> 12:02.724
- again.
- That's a boy, Launchpad.

12:02.791 --> 12:05.807
Good to see you're finally
taking things seriously.

12:05.874 --> 12:07.954
Fill, fold,
roll, and tuck.

12:08.021 --> 12:09.731
Real burrito fillings
are a lot messier

12:09.798 --> 12:11.023
than these practice ones.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.418
If you can't
tuck those ends,

12:12.485 --> 12:13.775
how are you ever
gonna make it

12:13.842 --> 12:15.237
through the
combination menu?

12:15.304 --> 12:17.700
We're going to die
down here.

12:18.926 --> 12:20.611
Now we just follow this
trail and we are...

12:20.668 --> 12:24.105
- back where we started?
- Louie's on it!

12:26.150 --> 12:27.772
How was your day, darling?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.353
I missed you.

12:31.544 --> 12:33.899
Stop touching
everything!

12:33.966 --> 12:36.223
I'm trying to get out
the way we came in.

12:36.281 --> 12:38.590
Plus, we get this
sweet souvenir.

12:38.761 --> 12:40.722
Hey, I think I saw
a skeleton over there.

12:40.789 --> 12:42.528
Really?!
Uh, no, no. No time.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.266
The prophecy says
we'll be cursed if...

12:44.333 --> 12:46.122
If we cross Toth-Ra,

12:46.189 --> 12:47.573
but that can
mean anything.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.527
Besides, the dumb pharaoh
isn't even here.

12:56.649 --> 13:00.586
Who dares disturb my chamber?

13:00.653 --> 13:03.389
Uh, ba... I'm Webby.

13:03.456 --> 13:05.948
Come on, let's go!

13:08.871 --> 13:10.596
Where are we going?

13:10.663 --> 13:12.438
The Pharaoh's throne room!

13:12.505 --> 13:13.925
And what are we
going to do?

13:13.992 --> 13:15.651
Anything he asks!

13:15.718 --> 13:18.260
No! You're gonna
stand up for yourselves

13:18.327 --> 13:19.801
while I rescue my kids.

13:19.868 --> 13:22.778
Right, but if we
attack Toth-Ra,

13:22.845 --> 13:24.660
and he tells us
to surrender,

13:24.727 --> 13:26.340
we should do that,
right?

13:26.644 --> 13:29.375
We've spent our lives
blindly serving Toth-Ra.

13:29.496 --> 13:31.894
Now we're trying to change
our whole way of life

13:31.988 --> 13:35.081
for the promise of
a simple bo-rrito.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.502
This is not just about

13:36.569 --> 13:38.044
- a simple burrito.
- Huh?

13:38.111 --> 13:39.965
It's about all kinds
of burritos.

13:40.032 --> 13:41.863
Wet burritos.

13:41.930 --> 13:43.848
- Yeah!
- Breakfast burritos.

13:43.906 --> 13:44.915
Yeah!

13:44.973 --> 13:45.993
Some people even put

13:46.051 --> 13:47.438
french fries
in their burritos.

13:47.496 --> 13:48.910
This is the dumbest rebellion

13:48.977 --> 13:50.462
I've ever been part of.

13:53.756 --> 13:56.708
Great, we crossed Toth-Ra
by messing with his stuff

13:56.775 --> 13:58.023
and now we're done for.

13:58.090 --> 14:00.512
Oh, why do you always
have to work an angle?

14:00.579 --> 14:02.840
- Good idea!
- No, wait!

14:03.504 --> 14:06.824
Toth-Ra, Pharaoh Lou-Rai
from next door. Hey!

14:06.918 --> 14:11.247
I am Toth-Ra,
commander of the sun.

14:11.519 --> 14:13.539
Dooh, hate to
pull rank, Chief,

14:13.606 --> 14:15.777
but, uh, I'm commander
of the whole universe,

14:15.844 --> 14:19.512
which kind of includes
the sun, so...

14:20.363 --> 14:23.365
Impossible.
Uh, come forth so that

14:23.432 --> 14:26.887
I may smite you,
vile pretender!

14:27.613 --> 14:31.847
No, you come over here
so I can smite you.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.824
Never!
You come over here

14:33.925 --> 14:35.869
because I'm going to
smite you...

14:35.984 --> 14:37.730
so hard.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.644
Get away from there!

14:42.761 --> 14:44.816
Uh, I am ordering
that guard

14:44.874 --> 14:48.811
to control me with my
awesome pharaoh powers.

14:49.153 --> 14:51.902
Ah, fine, you got me.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.231
How is this part
of the prophecy?

14:55.346 --> 14:57.738
Webby, it's not a prophecy.
It's a con.

14:57.941 --> 14:59.741
How long you been running
this pyramid scheme?

14:59.798 --> 15:02.691
My ancestor was
Toth-Ra's personal guard.

15:02.816 --> 15:05.867
He was supposed to protect him
till he awakened in here.

15:05.934 --> 15:07.973
But he never woke up.

15:08.113 --> 15:10.176
So to give everyone hope,

15:10.283 --> 15:12.598
he set up this rig
so the pharaoh could

15:12.656 --> 15:16.855
fulfill his promise to bring
the people their golden reward.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.457
Wait, the golden reward
is just the sun?

15:19.629 --> 15:20.726
That's lame.

15:20.793 --> 15:23.255
And your family decided
to keep tricking the people

15:23.322 --> 15:25.757
so they'd worship you
and do your bidding.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.699
Ugh, but the prophecy!

15:27.832 --> 15:30.785
- The mummy.
- All fake.

15:30.949 --> 15:34.540
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone.

15:34.769 --> 15:36.292
Aww, don't worry, Webbs.

15:36.359 --> 15:38.520
You'll get ripped apart
by a real mummy some day.

15:40.363 --> 15:42.023
Pharaoh, Toth-Ra!

15:42.090 --> 15:44.644
Your people
demand freedom!

15:44.741 --> 15:47.111
To eat <i> barbacoa!</i>

15:47.280 --> 15:49.071
But mostly
the freedom part.

15:49.129 --> 15:50.926
Now release my family!

15:50.993 --> 15:52.914
Hey, how did you...
I... I mean,

15:52.972 --> 15:55.902
you dare intrude
upon the pharaoh?!

15:55.960 --> 15:57.921
Loyal followers,

15:58.066 --> 16:00.252
the guard has crossed me.

16:00.311 --> 16:02.449
Take him away!

16:03.098 --> 16:04.690
Whoa!

16:04.757 --> 16:06.177
Hey-a, Mr. McDuck.

16:06.254 --> 16:07.629
Webby!

16:07.828 --> 16:08.908
Where's Louie?

16:08.966 --> 16:11.066
Be free, my people!

16:11.207 --> 16:13.191
Ooh, and pack up
the treasure.

16:13.277 --> 16:15.785
It is prophesied
that you will one day

16:15.843 --> 16:19.730
give it to a young, handsome
duck dressed all in green.

16:19.927 --> 16:21.572
Never mind.
I found him.

16:21.630 --> 16:23.916
Or just give it to me.

16:24.010 --> 16:28.846
And I shall give it to the
charming, young man myself.

16:34.919 --> 16:35.933
A prophecy!

16:35.991 --> 16:37.516
I know! I just couldn't

16:37.623 --> 16:38.993
translate this last glyph.

16:39.182 --> 16:42.924
It says, "Beware all those
who cross Toth-Ra...

16:42.991 --> 16:44.927
past this point."

16:54.088 --> 16:56.187
Yes! The mummy's real!

16:58.339 --> 16:59.917
Aah!

17:00.102 --> 17:02.354
Oh, great. Yeah,
that's a bad thing.

17:14.236 --> 17:15.338
Louie!

17:15.396 --> 17:18.518
I'll teach you to pick on my
family, you bandaged bampot!

17:18.686 --> 17:20.055
Attack!

17:20.122 --> 17:22.044
- Aah!
- Aah!

17:24.588 --> 17:27.550
Mummy squad,
show him what you got!

17:33.431 --> 17:35.001
Yah!

17:35.544 --> 17:36.952
Hmm.

17:39.228 --> 17:41.206
Right, this was a bad plan.

17:41.273 --> 17:42.697
I see that now.

17:44.878 --> 17:46.494
Attack plan foxtrot!

17:55.517 --> 17:57.052
- Told ya!
- A coincidence.

17:57.189 --> 17:58.580
That beetle could've
said anything.

17:58.647 --> 18:01.096
Enough flapping about,
you towering tattie bogle!

18:01.163 --> 18:02.834
Let my children go... aah!

18:02.955 --> 18:04.586
Mr. McD!

18:09.481 --> 18:10.748
Aah!

18:13.453 --> 18:15.063
Help!

18:18.311 --> 18:20.577
I'm coming, Louie!

18:20.692 --> 18:21.770
Hmm.

18:22.064 --> 18:23.605
Huey, Dewey,
stay here.

18:23.672 --> 18:25.937
Launchpad,
Launchpad?

18:26.077 --> 18:27.913
No, Launchpad.

18:28.529 --> 18:29.827
Is he okay?

18:29.885 --> 18:31.093
Don't lose hope.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.838
Remember the burritos.

18:32.905 --> 18:35.101
When a burrito falls apart
you got to

18:35.218 --> 18:37.960
put it in a bowl
and eat it with a fork.

18:38.018 --> 18:41.210
Or, uh, grab
some tortilla chips

18:41.293 --> 18:43.138
and make nachos, I guess.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.256
Uh, is any of this
making sense?

18:45.405 --> 18:47.393
This was never
about burritos.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.802
It wasn't? -It's about
freedom to make a choice.

18:50.869 --> 18:53.649
A choice bigger than
beef or veggies.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.096
We've lived
our whole lives

18:55.163 --> 18:57.429
toiling in the service
of the pharaoh.

18:57.496 --> 18:59.851
Now we get to choose
for ourselves.

18:59.918 --> 19:01.272
And what do we want?

19:01.339 --> 19:03.118
Burritos!

19:03.185 --> 19:04.646
Wow. Okay, then.

19:04.713 --> 19:06.108
Charge!

19:16.038 --> 19:18.464
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

19:18.531 --> 19:20.944
I could help you, you
know, with a little buzz

19:21.101 --> 19:22.702
and some facetime
at the right crypts

19:22.760 --> 19:24.897
I could make you
bigger than Tut, man!

19:24.999 --> 19:27.959
Aah! Would you believe
that this is all a dream?

19:29.197 --> 19:30.240
Fine!

19:30.298 --> 19:31.527
Look, I'm just a scared kid

19:31.594 --> 19:33.094
who talked himself
into a problem

19:33.161 --> 19:34.655
that he can't
get out of, okay?

19:34.757 --> 19:36.007
No more rule bending.

19:36.233 --> 19:37.923
Let's just do this your way.

19:38.118 --> 19:39.655
I am your humble servant.

19:39.798 --> 19:42.845
What can I do for you,
almighty Toth-Ra?

19:45.118 --> 19:46.952
Die.

19:47.087 --> 19:49.048
- Oh, man.
- Louie!

19:50.523 --> 19:52.564
If we can get him
back across the seal

19:52.631 --> 19:55.090
maybe he'll stop trying
to destroy everyone.

19:55.166 --> 19:57.077
How are we gonna get
a ten-foot mummy

19:57.135 --> 19:58.279
back across the seal?

19:58.346 --> 20:01.317
By offering him
a golden reward!

20:04.877 --> 20:06.038
Huh?

20:09.919 --> 20:12.051
Just like Launchpad taught you.

20:12.109 --> 20:14.372
Fill, fold, roll, and tuck!

20:20.751 --> 20:23.129
That's the biggest burrito
I've ever seen.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.697
Aah! The sun god is angry!

20:35.764 --> 20:38.161
Everyone back inside!

20:39.270 --> 20:41.547
Oh...
Never mind.

20:41.723 --> 20:44.340
So, what are you gonna do
now you're free?

20:48.290 --> 20:50.528
We'll take 100 quesadillas,

20:50.684 --> 20:52.114
55 tostadas,

20:52.254 --> 20:55.450
and 200 burrito <i> especiales,
</i> please.

20:55.961 --> 20:59.208
Oh, well, this is embarrassing.

20:59.356 --> 21:00.826
This one's on me.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.448
That will be $9,000.

21:02.515 --> 21:04.766
- My money.
- Aww, thanks, Mr. McD.

21:04.833 --> 21:06.017
I'll get you back.

21:06.084 --> 21:07.913
Then we found
a secret tunnel.

21:07.980 --> 21:09.521
Then we awoke
the cursed mummy.

21:09.588 --> 21:12.247
And then we almost died again.

21:12.504 --> 21:16.081
Hey, Webby, thanks for saving
my life a bunch back there.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.699
I'll try to listen
to you next time

21:17.766 --> 21:20.345
and not, you know,
"pull a Louie."

21:20.489 --> 21:21.967
Seriously, that's
a thing now?

21:22.043 --> 21:23.364
It's all about branding.

21:23.431 --> 21:26.747
Launchpad, bringer
of the bo-rrito,

21:26.848 --> 21:29.598
as thanks
we bestow upon ye

21:29.712 --> 21:32.278
the golden khopesh
of Toth-Ra.

21:32.336 --> 21:33.625
Hey, thanks!

21:33.683 --> 21:36.328
And Scrooge,
mighty warrior,

21:36.645 --> 21:40.567
as thanks for helping us
see the light... pun intended,

21:40.735 --> 21:43.171
we give you this!

21:53.711 --> 21:55.476
Mm, you know,

21:55.536 --> 21:57.973
this is actually
not bad at all.

21:58.114 --> 22:00.509
Delicious bo-rrito!
