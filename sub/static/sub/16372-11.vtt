WEBVTT

00:11.680 --> 00:13.399
It's fine where it is.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.237
Call a doctor! You all right?

00:38.840 --> 00:40.991
I'll muddle through.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.591
I'm okay.
Braxton Hicks. I'll be okay, really.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.869
Hey, Jess, easy.
Lurch's hackles are up.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.794
Let's go, ladies.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.073
We can't lose that car!

01:20.240 --> 01:22.755
Go! Go! Move!

01:33.960 --> 01:35.235
They're half a block back.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.754
Not for long.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.753
Shame. It was a nice ride.

03:19.240 --> 03:23.075
Zack. We've spent the last 40 minutes
being regaled...

03:23.240 --> 03:26.392
...with stories
of Abe's latest visit to Phoenix.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.320
Fascinating as it is to hear about...

03:29.520 --> 03:32.274
...the new culinary options
at Sky Harbor Airport...

03:32.480 --> 03:34.949
...I don't come here to talk to Abe.
No offense, Abe.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.397
I had some trouble with the missus.
You know how it is.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.076
But end of business, your money will
be cleaner than a nun's browser history.

03:42.280 --> 03:46.320
While you're redistributing,
an investment opportunity has come up.

03:46.480 --> 03:47.755
I need funds in that amount.

03:47.920 --> 03:51.357
What are you buying this time?
Another herd of Akhal-Teke horses?

03:51.520 --> 03:56.072
God, no. Although one could never have
enough of those beautiful animals.

03:56.240 --> 04:00.314
There is, however, a floundering
cruise line in urgent need of a bailout.

04:00.480 --> 04:05.475
Elizabeth, I'd like to introduce you
to one of my accountants, Zack Smoll.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.909
I'm an FBI agent.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.869
Mr. Reddington is my CI,
which forces me to ignore his crimes...

04:11.040 --> 04:15.114
...which will include murdering you
if either of you ever tell anyone.

04:15.680 --> 04:19.230
On the other hand, I am under no
obligation to ignore your crimes...

04:19.440 --> 04:22.751
...so before you commit any while I'm
here, I suggest you all run along.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.230
- Hey.
- Same.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.756
Someone overcaffeinated this morning.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.153
You said you had a case.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.631
Your government's
witness protection list has been stolen.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.035
You know who stole it?

04:40.200 --> 04:43.511
No, but I know
who's going to steal it next.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.919
A stolen luxury vehicle
in Atlanta being pursued...

04:48.080 --> 04:51.039
...by the private security
contractors hired to protect it.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.873
A car with its own security guards?

04:53.040 --> 04:56.431
This was a jewel heist that netted
over 10 million in diamonds...

04:56.600 --> 04:59.638
...perpetrated by a heist crew
known as The Harem.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.395
Well, this Harem is an elite group
of female thieves...

05:04.560 --> 05:06.392
...who steal only from other criminals.

05:06.880 --> 05:10.351
And with the witness protection list
out in the open...

05:10.520 --> 05:12.273
...the timing is no coincidence.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.956
Every one of those witnesses would be
in danger if their identities get out.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.033
Which makes the list
extraordinarily valuable...

05:19.200 --> 05:21.192
...and irresistible to the Harem.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.750
Catch them in the act of stealing it...

05:23.920 --> 05:27.038
...and you'll save the lives
of everyone on that list.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.237
How are we supposed
to catch them in the act?

05:29.400 --> 05:32.950
You can't. And if you can't beat them,
as the saying goes...

05:33.120 --> 05:35.237
Join them?
That's Reddington's plan?

05:35.400 --> 05:37.119
To put you undercover
in a heist crew?

05:37.280 --> 05:40.398
The Harem is responsible
for a number of high-line thefts.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.631
The disappearance
of half a dozen paintings...

05:42.800 --> 05:44.792
...from the Ostergaard museum
in Denmark in 2012.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.954
Those thieves were arrested
a year later, weren't they?

05:48.160 --> 05:51.232
Not before the Harem stole
the paintings from them.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.556
Lowry Fool's Gold,
a Mexican drug lord's prize racehorse...

05:55.720 --> 05:57.837
...went missing in 2014.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.716
Reddington says the Harem
auctioned it for 6 million dollars.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.317
When they hit
the National Bank of Belize...

06:04.480 --> 06:07.393
...they emptied out
the top-secret safety-deposit box...

06:07.560 --> 06:08.880
...of a French arms dealer.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.716
The leader of the Harem is a woman
named Margot Rochet.

06:12.880 --> 06:16.590
She's staying at the Fairborne
under the alias Kate Morgan.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.480
How do we get her to believe
that you're an elite thief?

06:19.640 --> 06:23.316
Reddington knows someone she worked
with in the past who can vouch for me.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.712
What makes you think
I know Margot Rochet?

06:26.880 --> 06:28.280
A little birdie told us.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.080
The same birdie who told us
that you have a brother...

06:31.280 --> 06:33.272
...doing six years for armed robbery.

06:34.200 --> 06:39.070
Vouch for Agent Keen and maybe Jimmy
will get out in time for the Super Bowl.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.960
I knew Margot.

06:45.120 --> 06:48.591
She likes to know
the people she works with. Control.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.679
She'll smell a lie on me a mile away.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.799
We'll go over our story
until we forget it's a lie.

06:54.960 --> 06:58.032
You're still gonna have
to prove yourself.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.039
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
I need to check the minibar.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.398
- Oh, I didn't drink anything.
- I'm so sorry. Hotel policy.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.711
I can come back later,
but I have to come back.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.913
No. Go ahead.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.671
Okay, I will be down
in about 10 minutes.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.991
Okay, yes, find out, then call him...

07:20.160 --> 07:23.153
...and tell him to back out.
The deal's non-negotiable.

07:23.320 --> 07:27.473
Do nuts count? Because I had
a small bag of salted almonds.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.758
Whatever, I couldn't resist. Sue me.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.713
Give me one good reason...

08:00.880 --> 08:04.157
...I shouldn't take you upstairs right now
and kick your ass.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.596
I'll give you 73.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.751
My name's Liz Crawford.
I want to join the Harem.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.159
And what do you do, Liz Crawford?

08:15.720 --> 08:16.915
I read people.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.910
I tell people exactly
what they need to hear...

08:20.080 --> 08:22.879
...in order to do exactly
what I need them to do.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.112
I got oilmen in North Dakota
to invest in a bogus casino deal.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.276
Did a couple runaway bride gigs.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.552
Worked with Craig Gaynier.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.270
He can vouch for me.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.234
You're either very good, Liz...

08:47.400 --> 08:49.392
...or you're very bad news.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.311
You're not going anywhere
till I find out which.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.674
Margot, what the hell?

09:30.880 --> 09:32.473
I'm sorry about the restraints...

09:32.640 --> 09:36.156
...but as I recall, you never seemed
to mind being tied up.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.191
This pretty little thing says
you two worked together.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.431
- True?
- Yeah.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.678
Liz Crawford.
Real estate con in Tallahassee.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.752
<i>Read the mark like she was
his childhood friend.</i>

09:49.920 --> 09:51.149
Wish we had eyes in there.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.352
- Take was 2 million.
- Two-point-one.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.716
Accuracy is everything in this business.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.917
Everything in this business.
I remember.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.359
There is one boss here.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.150
You do as I say.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.198
And no questions asked.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.636
- I understand.
- Good.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.995
Shoot him.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.470
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I'm told the feds are kicking...

10:20.680 --> 10:23.798
...your baby brother for "good behavior."

10:23.960 --> 10:27.795
And since his behavior is never good,
that means he cut a deal...

10:27.960 --> 10:32.000
- ...or you cut one for him.
- That's crazy. I'd never do that.

10:32.160 --> 10:36.040
Never sell me out
to save your own flesh and blood?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.918
I told you to shoot him.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.750
Shoot him yourself.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.232
<i>I gave you an order.</i>

10:51.400 --> 10:54.711
No, you gave me a test,
and I'm gonna tell you why I passed:

10:55.200 --> 10:58.511
You don't need blind followers.
What you're interested in is loyalty.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.674
I worked with Craig. I'm loyal to him.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.230
Take me on, I'll be equally loyal to you.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.952
You are good.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.469
And you're right. Loyalty is everything.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.873
But I still haven't forgotten Majorca.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.119
Welcome to the Harem.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.640
We dangled Gaynier out there
and now he's dead.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.759
And after we get that WITSEC list,
Margot will pay for that.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.475
We have intel on the rest
of the Harem. Aram.

11:38.640 --> 11:42.270
Right. Okay.
You already know Margot Rochet.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.636
She's a former
federal corrections administrator.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.713
Has a network of prisoners and guards,
trading anything...

11:47.880 --> 11:49.109
...for intel into the criminal world.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.749
Must be how she learned about
our deal with Gaynier.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.833
<i>Sasha Lau.
She graduated from Smith in '08.</i>

11:55.000 --> 11:57.720
<i>Couldn't find a job,
put her degree in actuarial science...</i>

11:57.880 --> 12:00.634
<i>...to work planning crimes.
She designs the heists.</i>

12:00.800 --> 12:02.712
<i>Jessica Piha is a chameleon.</i>

12:02.880 --> 12:07.079
<i>She can blend into any crowd,
but she is impulsive, an adrenaline junkie.</i>

12:07.240 --> 12:09.277
<i>I can't ID Emma Knightly.</i>

12:09.440 --> 12:13.195
From the audio on Agent Keen's wire,
she sounds like she's from England.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.999
Other than that, I'm drawing a blank.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.872
A rackets informant in witness protection
was murdered in Dubuque.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.157
- Jordan Pomaville.
- Here we go. It's starting.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.471
Tell Reddington.
See if he can find who did it.

12:23.680 --> 12:27.276
That person has the list,
or knows where to find it.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.390
I am sorry I'm late. Gentlemen.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.394
I'm Carter Wilson. I spoke
with your associate on the phone.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.310
I'm not certain
what I can do for you, Mr. Lockhart.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.996
I'll be blunt, Mr. Wilson.
Whistler Cruise Line is sinking.

12:45.200 --> 12:50.400
The band is on deck and warming up
"Nearer My God To Thee."

12:51.600 --> 12:56.356
- We're having some difficulties...
- Running aground on endangered reefs...

12:56.520 --> 12:58.591
...E. coli at the buffet...

12:58.760 --> 13:01.070
...sailing half-empty ships.

13:01.240 --> 13:05.120
Your difficulties are about to land you
in bankruptcy court.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.555
How did you hear about that?

13:06.760 --> 13:10.720
Have you been to Mont Saint Michel?
Tidal island in Normandy.

13:10.880 --> 13:15.557
The only way in or out used to be
a causeway that disappeared at high tide.

13:15.720 --> 13:19.600
To reach the other side was a matter
of knowing when the tide came in...

13:19.760 --> 13:24.118
...and seizing the opportunity
before it arrived.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.791
- I'm afraid I don't follow.
- I'm offering you a causeway, Carter.

13:27.960 --> 13:31.920
I bail you out, you transport my cargo.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.713
What kind of cargo?

13:33.880 --> 13:38.477
It could be Dutch tulip bulbs to New York,
ghost guns from Danao.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.235
But instead of hypotheticals,
allow me to assure you...

13:41.400 --> 13:44.234
...that plausible deniability is
the best option.

13:44.400 --> 13:49.031
I save your business,
you don't look too closely at mine.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.520
This job is hard.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.077
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

14:34.240 --> 14:36.357
It's for anxiety.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.793
Depression.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.713
Pain.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.676
Mental, physical, definitely spiritual.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.314
This should help.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.630
Hair of the dog.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.350
Oh, that wasn't a dog.
That was a woolly mammoth.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.071
You're a funny drunk.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.030
Chatty.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.470
Chatty?

15:06.920 --> 15:08.320
Couldn't shut you up.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.393
That's embarrassing.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.000
I mean, how embarrassing was it?

15:15.160 --> 15:17.391
Not embarrassing at all.

15:18.040 --> 15:21.158
Good. That's a relief.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.279
It was more revealing.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.559
How revealing was it exactly?

15:29.400 --> 15:32.234
Enough for me to know
what you're really about.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.520
Now get some sleep.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.876
We got a big day tomorrow.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.830
The guy your government was protecting
was murdered by Tony Giannusa.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.320
Giannusa's New Jersey mob.

15:57.480 --> 16:01.360
- Justice has a racketeering case on him.
- Not if their star witness is dead.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.200
If Giannusa gets us to the WITSEC list,
why don't we go after him ourselves?

16:04.400 --> 16:07.313
Because you don't know if he has it
or where to procure it.

16:07.480 --> 16:10.917
If you arrest him, you'll never find out.
Only Agent Keen can ascertain that.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.912
Keen's gone dark. No contact.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.115
You have protocols in place
for when she makes contact.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.796
And an understanding
that she'd reach out day one. She didn't.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.839
She will.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.272
But only after she's won their trust.

16:26.440 --> 16:30.639
Keep me informed, Harold.
I want to know when Elizabeth checks in.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.958
- Smoll?
- I've tried him twice.

16:34.120 --> 16:38.319
Try again. I want to know
the minute the transfer is complete.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.719
To get the WITSEC list,
we need to get Giannusa alone.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.951
- We have leverage once we do.
- What leverage?

16:47.120 --> 16:50.431
Giannusa had a courier
transporting diamonds through Atlanta.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.478
We stole them. He wants them back.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.994
The robbery spooked him.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.669
He's hiding behind his security
at The Vegas Strip.

16:56.840 --> 17:00.629
- We're going to Nevada?
- No, Giannusa's strip club downtown.

17:00.800 --> 17:04.191
Armed guards here and here.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.670
Cameras with motion sensors
and night vision.

17:06.839 --> 17:09.230
All we gotta do is find a way
to get past them.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.233
Or maybe we don't.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.199
Looking for something special?

17:49.280 --> 17:50.509
What's all the racket?

17:50.680 --> 17:52.672
I pay you to dance,
not stand in the back...

17:52.880 --> 17:55.759
...clucking like a bunch of hens
in hair extensions.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.240
What do you got there, Lexie?

18:05.920 --> 18:06.956
You know who I am?

18:07.120 --> 18:10.033
I know you're missing 72 stones
just like that one.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.869
You want them back?

18:12.040 --> 18:16.239
Be at the Menchaca Produce
warehouse tomorrow morning at 10.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.671
I don't walk out of here in 30 seconds,
you never see your diamonds again.

18:39.240 --> 18:42.074
Giannusa's not with them. Pay up.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.197
Bollocks.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.071
You may want to call your boss.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.596
What the hell are you saying?

18:50.480 --> 18:53.473
What? Slow... Hey...

18:55.120 --> 18:57.351
You said the diamonds would be
at the warehouse.

18:57.520 --> 19:02.197
No, I didn't. I said you'd get them back
if you went to the warehouse.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.430
You didn't.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.117
Now we get to talk in private.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.595
This one says she reads people.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.119
Like those FBI mind-hunters
who predict behavior.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.794
It's nonsense, right?

19:17.960 --> 19:21.795
But I will be damned
if she didn't just predict yours.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.954
The diamonds are in a locker
at the bus depot downtown.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.397
You get the locker number and a key...

19:30.600 --> 19:32.319
...on two conditions.

19:34.680 --> 19:35.750
I'm listening.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.480
One, tell us who's got the WITSEC list.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.839
Two, burn this place down.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.552
- Find out who's got the list?
- Ever heard of the hacker Helldritch?

19:49.720 --> 19:54.033
Of course. The guy's hit
political candidates, government servers.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.874
He's released thousands
of classified documents online.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.680
The guy's a national security nightmare.
Where is he?

20:00.160 --> 20:01.355
I don't know.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.558
Giannusa's contact with him was digital.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.513
As soon as we get a location, we move.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.433
So how's that cover holding up?

20:09.640 --> 20:11.313
Margot's on board.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.639
Emma... Something's off.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.356
Has Aram had any luck
with her background?

20:18.520 --> 20:21.319
No. It's like her ID was
professionally scrubbed.

20:22.360 --> 20:25.512
Tell him to keep looking.
I'll do some digging of my own.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.758
I want to figure out
who this woman is.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.832
Something feels off about her.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.474
She works for you?

21:21.560 --> 21:23.472
I placed Emma Knightly in the Harem...

21:23.640 --> 21:27.350
...so she could keep me posted
as to their criminal activities.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.716
So she could tell you
what they were stealing...

21:29.880 --> 21:33.556
- ...so you could steal it first?
- Something like that.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.315
If you already had someone inside,
then why add me?

21:36.800 --> 21:39.076
Because Emma went silent.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.796
You're telling me she turned?

21:43.200 --> 21:46.079
Who is she, anyway?
Aram says her records were scrubbed.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.273
Yes. By MI-6.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.760
So she's a British agent.

21:50.920 --> 21:54.391
You can't think the FBI is
the only law enforcement agency...

21:54.560 --> 21:56.517
...I have a relationship with.

21:58.080 --> 22:02.791
Elizabeth, none of this changes the fact
that the WITSEC list is still in play.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.755
She knows who I am.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.550
Emma Knightly can be trusted.
I wouldn't have put you in otherwise.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.036
You wouldn't have put me in
if she had been reporting back to you.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.955
So whether or not she can be trusted
remains to be seen.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.756
What's so urgent?

22:29.200 --> 22:30.316
I found our in.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.437
To Helldritch? That was fast.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.671
I do a lot of favors.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.196
This cute little chola I had a fling with
who leased server space to Helldritch...

22:39.360 --> 22:40.555
...for a ransomware scam...

22:41.120 --> 22:42.713
...she'll know where Helldritch is.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.598
Why don't you bring
our new social engineer with you?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.440
She's proving to be quite an asset.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.037
When I said the job was hard,
I meant working for Reddington.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.075
Don't worry, the others don't know.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.518
How long has it been?

23:15.360 --> 23:17.591
Almost eight years.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.593
I was working as an analyst...

23:20.760 --> 23:24.640
...on low-level immigration cases
when he cut a deal.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.953
Reddington works for MI-6?

23:27.680 --> 23:29.273
I don't know.

23:30.280 --> 23:33.114
I left. I went to work for him full-time.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.237
Why would you ever do that?

23:39.200 --> 23:41.431
I was starstruck.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.191
He made me feel
like I was the center of his universe.

23:47.080 --> 23:51.040
It was exciting and captivating and...

23:51.800 --> 23:54.031
...it consumed me.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.957
My work. My marriage.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.511
I had no idea how many lines
I was crossing until it was too late.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.751
It's never too late.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.031
Spoken like someone
who's still in the honeymoon phase.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.391
Trust me, that ends.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.640
You should get out before it does.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.235
She knows you're FBI?
Keen, we gotta pull you out.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.995
Margot's contact says
Helldritch is in Hong Kong.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.039
- We have no jurisdiction there.
- Our only shot at recovering...

24:26.200 --> 24:28.078
...the list is to have
the Harem steal it...

24:28.240 --> 24:30.800
- ...and I've gotta be there.
- If Emma rolls on you?

24:30.960 --> 24:32.030
She won't.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.039
Why? Because Reddington's got
his hooks in her?

24:36.040 --> 24:39.431
We can't let the Harem steal
the WITSEC list and run with it.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.069
She's with Margot.
You said so yourself.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.515
I know you're worried about me...

24:45.680 --> 24:47.831
...and I appreciate it.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.710
But I trust her.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.354
I'll make contact from Hong Kong.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.231
That's the fourth message I've left.
Should I send someone?

24:59.800 --> 25:01.951
We'll know soon enough.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.316
Carter! I'd stand...

25:04.520 --> 25:07.752
...but after all these years,
I still get aroused when I close a deal.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.273
I closed a deal.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.669
You didn't.

25:13.280 --> 25:17.320
- What are you talking about?
- Your Bitcoin transfer never arrived.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.634
Something's come up
and my accountant's unreachable.

25:20.800 --> 25:24.237
It'll soon be remedied. You'll have
your money before close of business.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.313
I already have it.
I made a deal with someone else.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.273
With whom, may I ask?

25:30.720 --> 25:32.632
Baldur Magnusson.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.318
You know him?

25:36.120 --> 25:40.034
Mr. Wilson, good day and happy sailing.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.995
Baldur Magnusson.
That's a coincidence.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.073
I don't believe in coincidences.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.994
To stealing from thieves.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.873
There you go.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.151
Listen.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.120
Hey.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.672
It's about loyalty, remember?

26:51.320 --> 26:54.438
- To the group.
- To me.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.035
You're either in or you're out.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.157
So, what's it gonna be?

27:13.920 --> 27:15.912
Am I interrupting?

27:18.080 --> 27:19.594
This doesn't concern you.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.032
It doesn't?

27:36.960 --> 27:39.839
Run along, little girl.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.237
Helldritch's home is a fortress.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.875
Hong Kong's premier hotel
for the rich and paranoid.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.590
Helldritch is the only permanent resident,
and he was just granted asylum...

28:03.760 --> 28:05.160
...so he's ready to celebrate.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.119
He's retrofitted it
with top-of-the-line security measures.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.317
<i>Guards at every door.
Cameras in every room.</i>

28:10.480 --> 28:12.995
<i>Everything's controlled
by an RFID transmitter.</i>

28:13.160 --> 28:16.392
<i>Radio frequencies emitted by the chip
communicate with every system.</i>

28:16.880 --> 28:18.200
<i>This thing is top-shelf.</i>

28:18.360 --> 28:21.558
<i>It includes a gig of storage,
which is where he keeps the WITSEC list.</i>

28:21.760 --> 28:24.275
Problem is,
the chip's implanted in his hand.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.272
So? Shoot him.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.239
Or cut off his hand.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.154
There's a microprocessor in the chip
tied to his heart rate.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.789
If he dies, so does the chip
and everything on it.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.360
Artificial heartbeat.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.038
The chip needs to be plugged
into the device within 20 seconds...

28:40.200 --> 28:43.398
- ...of being removed from his hand.
- Security is state-of-the-art.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.200
Break a window, touch a statue,
whole suite locks down.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.200
So how do we get inside?

28:48.360 --> 28:51.990
- We'll have one in the basement...
- En route, 90 seconds out.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.914
<i>...one in the van spotting,
and you three in the bar.</i>

28:55.080 --> 28:57.993
Now, wait for Sasha's go-ahead,
and then...

28:58.160 --> 29:01.039
We crash the party. Can't wait.

29:07.560 --> 29:08.880
About last night...

29:09.040 --> 29:11.839
- It was nothing.
- You protected me.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.280
I have a son.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.351
A junior at boarding school.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.512
He plays soccer.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.717
I go to visit him sometimes,
or at least I try.

29:26.040 --> 29:29.397
I usually just end up sitting in the car,
watching him practice.

29:29.560 --> 29:33.474
I want to talk to him,
but I don't know what I'd say...

29:34.680 --> 29:37.798
...about what I have become.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.634
You act like it's too late.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.795
It isn't. You could still get out.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.470
I dream about that...

29:48.840 --> 29:50.399
...the life I had...

29:50.840 --> 29:53.275
...wishing I could get it back.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.270
I can help you.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.792
The WITSEC list, when we get it back...

30:01.960 --> 30:03.838
...I can get you on it.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.512
Testify against Margot.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.352
Start over.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.600
<i>Ladies.</i>

30:13.760 --> 30:15.717
Target is on site.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.156
<i>It's go time.</i>

30:26.720 --> 30:29.713
You have officially RSVP'd.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.352
Bedroom is down a hall,
east side of the suite.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.390
Take a left.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.795
Making our way to the bedroom, Margot.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.360
Sasha, clear to breach?

30:57.520 --> 30:59.159
<i>Looping footage now.</i>

30:59.320 --> 31:00.913
Security's blind for five minutes.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.152
I've got eyes on the target.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.710
<i>The girls should have
the bedroom ready by now.</i>

31:24.880 --> 31:26.792
You are clear for approach.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.955
Congratulations on your citizenship.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.471
Thanks. Hong Kong recognizes talent
when they see it.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.994
I heard you're a man of many talents.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.119
Please elaborate.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.999
You're able to find certain people.

31:43.680 --> 31:47.959
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do. The WITSEC list.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.431
Tony Giannusa and I are friends.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.560
Got anywhere we can talk business?

31:58.880 --> 32:01.759
Target is on the move.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.031
- Who are you?
- We were waiting for the loo.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.839
You've been ages.

32:11.560 --> 32:15.156
What are you do...?
We only have two darts.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.232
What the hell?

32:23.800 --> 32:25.871
Oh, hell, no.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.993
Get something to restrain him!

32:28.160 --> 32:29.753
Want to tell me what's going on?

32:29.920 --> 32:33.072
- Jessica, find something!
- I'm looking.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.154
Help! Security!

32:35.320 --> 32:36.674
Here. Use this belt.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.350
Is he still alive?

32:51.520 --> 32:54.877
Ninety seconds until system reset.
I'm locked out after that.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.434
Got it.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.798
Okay, we gotta go.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.079
We're good.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.120
Hey, are you okay?

33:24.280 --> 33:26.078
I'll muddle through.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.638
You've got blood on your face.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.996
Go. We'll be right behind you.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.234
Where the hell is Emma going?

33:40.720 --> 33:42.313
<i>What's going on?</i>

33:42.480 --> 33:43.596
She's on the move.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.877
She took the chip.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.679
She's using our exit strategy.
We gotta get out of here.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.551
<i>- Jessica's down!
- You know the protocol.</i>

34:15.719 --> 34:17.757
Split up.
Rendezvous when the heat's off.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.310
Screw protocol! Jessica's dead!

34:20.480 --> 34:21.755
Emma's got the list!

34:21.920 --> 34:25.197
<i>- See you in 72 hours.
- Wait, wait. What about Emma?</i>

34:25.760 --> 34:28.672
Margot! Margot.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.353
Call an ambulance!

34:37.520 --> 34:38.795
And the cops!

34:45.679 --> 34:47.558
I'm gonna need your security badge...

34:47.960 --> 34:49.838
...and your phone.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.190
The whole thing went sideways.
Jessica's dead.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.080
<i>The rest of the Harem...
I don't know, they split up.</i>

35:05.240 --> 35:07.709
Margot and Sasha are leaving
the country under aliases.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.236
Eva Taylor and Lily Hum.
Aram, can you...?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.596
- Tracking them now.
- What about the list?

35:12.760 --> 35:15.150
Emma took it. You were right.

35:15.320 --> 35:16.549
Elizabeth, you know her.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.353
<i>- Clearly I don't.
- You do.</i>

35:18.520 --> 35:21.194
More than any of us.
What did she tell you? Think.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.353
She burned MI-6,
burned Reddington, the Harem.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.398
<i>She has nowhere to go.</i>

35:29.080 --> 35:31.311
Oh, my God. That's it.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.080
Hello, Emma.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.876
How did you find me?

35:47.840 --> 35:49.991
He looks just like you.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.870
I've missed so much.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.599
I don't want to miss any more.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.429
I can't let you sell the list.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.798
I can't let you fund a life on the run...

36:02.960 --> 36:06.271
...by exposing innocent people
on that list.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.353
I don't think you understand me.
I'm done.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.758
I know the consequences.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.957
I have to stop.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.952
I'm out, Raymond.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.833
There's a cabin in Vermont
on Lake Champlain.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.196
Remote. Simple.

36:27.360 --> 36:30.910
Once you're settled,
you'll open a bank account.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.316
Money will be transferred into it...

36:33.480 --> 36:37.759
...to cover expenses, Will's education.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.157
Why are you doing this?

36:43.120 --> 36:46.830
If you wanted out, Emma,
you should have come to me.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.960
I didn't think that was an option.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.432
I'm sorry.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.951
So I'm out?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.599
The list.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.753
You need to let her go.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.071
Emma's disappeared.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.317
You got to her before we could.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.720
Yes.

37:54.760 --> 37:56.479
The list.

37:58.400 --> 38:02.030
She betrayed you, so you killed her...

38:02.200 --> 38:04.237
...just like you killed Mr. Kaplan?

38:15.680 --> 38:17.558
- Elizabeth...
- And I'm just supposed to...

38:17.720 --> 38:20.440
...look the other way, right?

38:21.200 --> 38:24.398
Just like I look the other way
from all the terrible things you do...

38:24.560 --> 38:27.837
...because they're for the greater good.
Just like this list.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.835
You want to kill someone
the government's protecting.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.834
But you can't find them,
so you had us...

38:34.440 --> 38:36.750
...find this list for you.

38:42.400 --> 38:47.395
Years ago, a Wisconsin housewife
named Maureen Rowan was outside...

38:47.560 --> 38:51.918
...in the wee hours
with the family dog, Dodger.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.120
It was absolutely frigid.

38:54.280 --> 38:57.751
No one in their right mind would be out
in that kind of bitter cold...

38:57.920 --> 39:00.116
...and if not for Dodger's aging bladder...

39:00.280 --> 39:02.556
...I imagine
Maureen would have been fast asleep.

39:02.720 --> 39:06.953
But as fate would have it,
her neighbor, Alexei Lagunov...

39:07.960 --> 39:11.271
<i>...the avtoritet of a Russian bratva...</i>

39:11.720 --> 39:15.236
...felt, given the late hour
and wind chill...

39:15.600 --> 39:19.753
<i>...he and his boyeviks could move a body
from his basement...</i>

39:19.960 --> 39:24.591
...to the trunk of an associate's car
without being observed.

39:27.800 --> 39:32.158
They didn't count
on Dodger's call to nature.

39:33.280 --> 39:36.751
So Maureen had a choice between...

39:37.160 --> 39:41.598
...remaining silent
or doing the right thing.

39:43.520 --> 39:46.115
She chose to testify.

39:47.320 --> 39:51.872
And while she helped
bring Alexei Lagunov to justice...

39:52.240 --> 39:56.234
...she also forfeited the rest of her life
in doing so.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.591
She's on that list.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.391
Who is she to you?

40:06.720 --> 40:10.634
Maureen Rowan is Kate's sister...
Mr. Kaplan's sister.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.669
I didn't need to find her.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.791
I just needed to...

40:21.880 --> 40:25.510
...make sure no one else can.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.072
This doesn't excuse what you've done.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.239
No.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.432
No, it doesn't.

40:55.760 --> 40:57.080
Raymond.

40:59.560 --> 41:04.112
I told her because I felt
it was important for her to know.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.877
I understand.

41:21.200 --> 41:25.035
Margot Rochet, you're under arrest
for the murder of Craig Gaynier.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.279
Come here.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.354
Margot Rochet is in custody...

41:31.520 --> 41:34.240
...and Sasha Lau was just picked up
at passport control.

41:34.400 --> 41:38.189
Helldritch's facing charges in Hong Kong
in connection with Jessica Piha's death.

41:38.360 --> 41:39.396
And Emma Knightly?

41:39.600 --> 41:41.990
Agent Keen recovered
the WITSEC list from Reddington.

41:42.160 --> 41:45.790
What that means for Emma Knightly,
I can't say.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.831
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.514
How much did he take?

41:51.680 --> 41:54.991
He's gone, Mr. Reddington.
The missus said it was a heart attack.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.677
- And the money? Where is it?
- I don't know.

41:58.840 --> 42:01.355
Nobody knows except Mr. Smoll.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.591
He'd transfer it
to an untraceable account...

42:03.760 --> 42:06.070
...then arrange for the Bitcoin wire
to pay for the ships.

42:06.240 --> 42:08.197
The wire wasn't made.
All that money...

42:08.360 --> 42:11.114
...it's still just sitting there
in some anonymous account.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.511
I mean, that could be anywhere
in the world.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.399
Thank you, Abe.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.232
Smoll didn't have a heart attack.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.279
Someone killed him.
Someone determined to start a war.
