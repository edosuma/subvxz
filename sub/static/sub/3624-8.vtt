11:06.566 --> 11:07.832
More linear.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.869
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Ooh, ooh! Yeah.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.272
Oh, gee.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.474
Ha ha! Sorry
about that.

11:16.476 --> 11:17.876
[Boo-hoo]

11:17.878 --> 11:20.211
Ball?

11:27.820 --> 11:30.288
I love it.
It's perfect.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.424
Yes! The perfect
mission clothes...

11:32.426 --> 11:34.459
Woman in hood: To break
us out of here.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.727
No deal.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.495
Whatev.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.297
Hey!

11:41.535 --> 11:44.903
So, dad, how many colleges
did you apply to?

11:44.905 --> 11:47.205
Well, honey, there was only
one college for me.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.741
Middleton's institute
of science and technology.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.844
I'll give you a tour. How
about tomorrow afternoon?

11:52.846 --> 11:56.214
Good, seeing as you've
already visited

11:56.216 --> 11:58.249
your mother's university.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.651
[Bell rings]

11:59.653 --> 12:05.990
And when is my college
admissions appointment, Mr. B.?

12:05.992 --> 12:09.994
Uh-huh. C-plus grade
average, former mad dog,

12:09.996 --> 12:11.663
current all-star
running back.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.732
How many colleges
will court me, huh,

12:13.734 --> 12:15.567
you know, I mean,
at last count?

12:15.569 --> 12:20.238
Not one of these so-called
"institutions of higher learning"

12:20.240 --> 12:21.740
asked about the Stoppable son.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.409
Yeah. That's really
surprising.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.912
Oh, hey, check it out. New
college opening this fall.

12:27.914 --> 12:32.283
Maybe all I need is a t-shirt
and these cuffed jeans.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.384
Cuffed jeans?

12:33.386 --> 12:34.552
Yeah. How over?

12:34.554 --> 12:38.323
International continental
university.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.458
You know, since they've
never had students before,

12:40.460 --> 12:41.893
they can't be that picky.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.496
Yup, sounds like I.C.U.
Is a perfect fit.

12:44.498 --> 12:45.730
You want to come
with, K.P.?

12:45.732 --> 12:47.465
Can't. I'm touring
my dad's college today.

12:47.467 --> 12:51.469
Stay positive, possible. You
will find a new mission outfit.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.805
Rufus, something we said?

12:53.807 --> 12:55.874
Plans! Plans? What plans?

12:55.876 --> 13:00.011
Oh, don't tell me he's
touring colleges, too.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.646
Oh, man.
Now I'm in a funk.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.048
And it's not
a good look for me.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.049
Bueno Nacho later?

13:05.051 --> 13:08.353
Huh. I think I'll
keep you around.

13:09.755 --> 13:12.557
Where to, buddy?

13:14.527 --> 13:16.294
Ah, lab 32 "a,"

13:16.296 --> 13:18.329
the first chemistry lab I
ever accidentally blew up.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.366
Maybe one day soon, you'll
be evacuating a lab

13:21.368 --> 13:23.334
on this very campus, Kimmy.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.037
Come on. Eight more
buildings to tour

13:26.039 --> 13:27.972
in earth sciences alone.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.876
And here's where I studied the
principles of micro-dynamic energies...

13:31.878 --> 13:35.947
My introduction to computational
methods of nano-biotechnologies.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.316
I can still feel the rush.

13:38.318 --> 13:43.721
This is dating myself, but
they were only on rf-16

13:43.723 --> 13:45.590
when I was an undergrad.

13:45.592 --> 13:49.093
Uh, dad, are you sure about
sticking your hand in there?

13:49.095 --> 13:51.996
Kimmy, there's no place for
skepticism in science.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.599
Now, watch this.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.969
Well, I'll be.
They perfected it.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.971
Wow. I didn't know
you were that strong.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.107
I'm not. Rf-78 absorbs
energy, multiplies it,

14:03.109 --> 14:05.810
and then outputs it. And
they seem to have solved

14:05.812 --> 14:07.645
the hives glitch, too.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.681
Go, Wade. Guess where
Drakken and Shego

14:09.683 --> 14:10.815
are stealing something now.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.951
Where?
About 30 yards from you.

14:12.953 --> 14:17.555
With the highest level security.
Nobody gets in.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.023
We were just about to tour it.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.959
They should be tripping
the alarm...

14:20.961 --> 14:23.895
Good luck, Kim. And
the battle suit?

14:23.897 --> 14:26.631
Still working on it.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.035
Say, dad?

14:33.939 --> 14:37.375
Shouldn't you be shopping for
something suitable to wear?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.477
Why? Purple seems
to be my color.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.579
It's like a little slice

14:41.581 --> 14:44.816
of experimental
computer chip heaven.

14:44.818 --> 14:46.384
I'll take that.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.052
Shego, is it so hard to keep

14:48.054 --> 14:49.721
one bouncy teenager at bay?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.923
Trying!

14:54.493 --> 14:57.495
Quantum tectonic
microchip at last!

14:57.497 --> 14:58.963
Ohh, she's making me
more nauseous than usual.

14:58.965 --> 15:03.568
Looks like purple isn't your
color after all, Kimmy.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.471
But come to think of it,
what is?

15:06.473 --> 15:10.141
[Kim speaking gibberish]

15:10.143 --> 15:13.645
Don't worry, honey. When you
reach the speed of light,

15:13.647 --> 15:15.980
the compound breaks down.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.651
Hello!

15:19.653 --> 15:22.120
Behold, the final piece.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.422
World domination at last.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.991
Ron: Let me guess.
Not a real university.

15:26.993 --> 15:29.861
Oh, you're gonna be schooled.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.100
I've tried everything.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.669
Kimmy, you'll find something.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.470
I won't.
Maybe Ron was right.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.473
Ronald right? Uh,
about what exactly?

15:42.475 --> 15:43.708
Maybe the clothes were key.

15:43.710 --> 15:48.579
Without my mission outfit,
I'm Kim impossible.

15:49.983 --> 15:53.117
Drakken: Where is
that Kim Possible?

15:53.119 --> 15:55.453
My arms and jaw are killing me.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.822
Don't you hate it when
heroes show up late?

15:57.824 --> 16:02.293
I told you, I came alone.
K.P. doesn't know I'm here.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.495
You know what? I'm beginning
to think he came alone

16:04.497 --> 16:06.631
and that Kim Possible
doesn't know he's here.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.900
Yeah. Ok, never went
to college, did he?

16:08.902 --> 16:15.006
For the last time, they let me in.
I just... I... grr!

16:15.008 --> 16:17.642
Without Kim Possible,
there's no one to stop me

16:17.644 --> 16:19.510
from charging
my greatest invention.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.980
We know. The intercontinental
hooey-majiggy.

16:21.982 --> 16:27.118
Intercontinental
electromagnetisizer, Shego!

16:31.090 --> 16:32.023
It's charging.

16:32.025 --> 16:36.060
Curious myself in an "I know this
will never work" sort of way.

16:36.062 --> 16:40.131
Let me educate you both, being
that this is a university.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.600
No, it's not.
No, it's not.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.871
Once charged with
enough electrons,

16:46.873 --> 16:49.073
an intense magnetic
field will merge

16:49.075 --> 16:53.277
the world's continents
into one supercontinent.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.146
[Sarcastically]
Ooh, it moves continents?

16:55.148 --> 16:56.848
Who wouldn't want one of those?

16:56.850 --> 17:00.618
Ah. Think how easy it would
be to rule the world, Shego,

17:00.620 --> 17:03.287
if it's all in one
central location.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.556
No more bumpy
transatlantic flights.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.258
Because there won't be
an Atlantic?

17:07.260 --> 17:10.194
That's right! One ocean,
one continent,

17:10.196 --> 17:12.997
and best of all, one time zone!

17:12.999 --> 17:14.866
Well, I do need
to set my watch.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.200
Oh, good. The next
time I'm in Miami,

17:16.202 --> 17:18.603
I can walk next-door to
Morocco and buy a carpet.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.938
You'll never get away
with this, Drakken.

17:20.940 --> 17:25.743
Oh, no, nothing. It just
seemed like the thing to say.

17:25.745 --> 17:26.611
[Bell rings]

17:26.613 --> 17:29.614
Hi. May I help you?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.150
Uh-huh!

17:32.152 --> 17:33.918
What are you sketching, Rufus?

17:33.920 --> 17:36.687
Kim's new mission outfit!

17:36.689 --> 17:37.655
Yup!

17:37.657 --> 17:40.124
I think you're on to something.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.928
Hey, are you gonna
order anything?

17:43.930 --> 17:45.663
Waiting for my boyfriend...

17:45.665 --> 17:46.964
For two hours.

17:46.966 --> 17:52.603
Hmm, Ron a no-show on a
3-for-1 chimirito day?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.105
Drakken: Ooh, look at
how the continents

17:54.107 --> 17:56.574
fit together like a puzzle.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.076
And only I,
Dr. Drakken,

17:58.078 --> 18:02.647
um, not really. You know, the
earth used to be like that

18:02.649 --> 18:04.182
a few hundred million
years ago.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.783
What? It's been
done before?

18:05.785 --> 18:08.886
Yup. It was called pangaea.
I missed it on a test,

18:08.888 --> 18:11.122
or was it the only one
I got right?

18:11.124 --> 18:14.058
Pangaea? Hmm. I
don't want to copy.

18:14.060 --> 18:18.129
I'll call it Drakkengaea.
Yes! Ha ha!

18:18.131 --> 18:20.164
What? It works.

18:20.166 --> 18:23.167
Phone on vibrate tickles!

18:23.169 --> 18:26.003
Hee hee! K.P., stop calling!

18:26.005 --> 18:27.605
I can't take it.

18:27.607 --> 18:32.176
Hey, Kimmy, your boyfriend
says not to call him anymore.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.878
Shego and Drakken have Ron.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.147
I need a trace
on Ron's cell phone.

18:36.149 --> 18:39.016
Easy. I can do that
with one hand.

18:39.018 --> 18:43.121
University. That's the college
Ron was touring today.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.789
Running a geothermal scan now.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.991
Hydraulics, magnetics,
tectonic censors...

18:46.993 --> 18:50.261
everything Drakken and Shego
stole in the last 48 hours.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.263
Looks like I've got
a new college to visit.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.765
Good. Glad you're not letting
your fashion disaster

18:54.767 --> 18:59.203
not when Ron needs me, mission
gear or no mission gear.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.973
Monique: How about
new mission gear?

19:01.975 --> 19:04.242
Mm-hmm! Surprise!

19:06.678 --> 19:08.813
It's almost done charging.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.981
3, 2, 1.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.049
Since we're counting,

19:12.051 --> 19:18.055
I count 1... oh, no...
2 losers.

19:21.995 --> 19:26.164
K.P.! Hey, sweet
mission threads.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.965
The look actually works,

19:27.967 --> 19:30.434
and it totally bugs
me to have to say it.

19:30.436 --> 19:34.105
And I can't wait
to break them in.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.041
Neither can I.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.911
Hyah! Uh!

19:40.078 --> 19:42.713
Nice, K.P.
how's it feel?

19:42.715 --> 19:45.116
Like I'm back.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.752
It's working, Shego!

19:47.754 --> 19:51.255
Yeah. I'm
as shocked as you.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.026
What's that thing
supposed to do?

19:55.028 --> 19:56.928
Merge all the continents
into one.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.696
You mean like pangaea.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.798
Drakkengaea!

20:10.008 --> 20:12.777
[Car alarm]

20:14.413 --> 20:19.116
Uh, Dr. D., you did build this
place to seismic standards,

20:19.118 --> 20:20.284
didn't you?

20:20.286 --> 20:21.852
Seismic standards?

20:21.854 --> 20:25.056
Yeah. For the shaking,
as entire continents move.

20:25.058 --> 20:28.125
It's always one
tiny detail. Aah!

20:28.127 --> 20:32.063
[Drakken speaking gibberish]

20:32.065 --> 20:34.498
Ohh.

20:39.304 --> 20:42.273
[Alarms]

20:45.110 --> 20:48.045
H... hey!

20:58.257 --> 21:02.860
You think your new mission
clothes are all that?

21:02.862 --> 21:04.128
[Inhales deeply]

21:04.130 --> 21:05.363
But they are not!

21:05.365 --> 21:07.098
Say, um, thanks
for the save, Kim.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.900
Back at you. I'm not sure
what would have happened

21:09.902 --> 21:11.269
if you hadn't gotten captured.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.137
That's what I'm here
for, K.P.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.106
One more mission to go...

21:15.108 --> 21:23.108
the college admission
uh, mission.

21:25.151 --> 21:33.151
The college admission
uh, mission.

21:34.894 --> 21:38.496
Ron: Hey, a question about pangaea!
Shh!

21:38.498 --> 21:41.065
So we're dying to know.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.067
Did you apply to my Alma mater?
Or mine?

21:43.069 --> 21:45.136
Um, actually, neither.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.171
Ron: But I did.

21:47.173 --> 21:49.040
Ron applied to every college.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.941
Every college in the country?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.076
Ron: Playing the odds.

21:52.078 --> 21:58.449
And science for you, dad. But
I've got to go with my...

21:58.451 --> 22:05.956
I applied to these schools. Actually,
Drakken sort of gave me the idea.

22:05.958 --> 22:12.263
It's a small world. I know.
I've saved it over and over.

22:12.265 --> 22:16.167
Well, we couldn't be prouder.

22:16.169 --> 22:19.036
Ron: I've got to send
out more applications,

22:19.038 --> 22:21.172
a lot more.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.244
So we get you
the orange jumpsuits,

22:27.246 --> 22:29.146
and you get us out of laundry duty.
Done.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.283
Kim: And you're done, too.

22:33.919 --> 22:36.187
Got the entire bribe on tape.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.922
This is an outrage.

22:37.924 --> 22:41.058
Don't do the time
if you can't do the crime,

22:41.060 --> 22:43.060
or something like that.

22:43.062 --> 22:46.097
I meant your mission clothes.

22:46.099 --> 22:48.265
