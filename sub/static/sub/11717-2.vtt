BOY
<i>Dad.</i>

00:24.896 --> 00:26.497
<i>Seriously?</i>

00:26.564 --> 00:28.432
It's, like, 6:00 in the morning.
Well, it's 6:15,

00:28.500 --> 00:30.167
you said you wanted to get up
early to study,

00:30.235 --> 00:31.702
so this is me waking you.

00:31.770 --> 00:32.703
Yeah, early,

00:32.771 --> 00:34.705
not the butt crack of dawn.

00:36.274 --> 00:37.708
Where are you?
Oh, we talked about this, bud.

00:37.776 --> 00:38.876
I have a big meeting
this morning.

00:38.943 --> 00:40.544
Oh. Right.

00:40.612 --> 00:43.280
Okay. You know,
everyone's been asking me

00:43.348 --> 00:45.282
if I'm going on
the Kahana camping trip.

00:45.350 --> 00:47.584
Evan, I don't know
if I feel comfortable you going

00:47.652 --> 00:48.852
camping without supervision.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.554
Jordan's uncle's gonna be there.

00:50.622 --> 00:52.423
Well, I don't know
Jordan's uncle, Evan.

00:52.490 --> 00:53.791
Dad, he's a librarian.

00:53.858 --> 00:56.026
How dangerous can he be?

00:56.094 --> 00:57.461
Okay, I'll
tell you what.

00:57.529 --> 00:58.929
You ace this test,
and then we'll talk

00:58.997 --> 00:59.930
about Kahana Valley, okay?

00:59.998 --> 01:02.099
You're such a dictator.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.834
I know. I'm the worst dad ever.

that just broke me.

03:28.259 --> 03:31.395
I'm so proud of them,
but they'd never know it.

03:31.462 --> 03:34.364
I've missed so much
of their lives, you know,

03:34.432 --> 03:37.868
watching them grow up and all.

03:37.936 --> 03:40.537
I guess that's the way
it has to be,

03:40.605 --> 03:42.072
till I figure this out.

03:43.508 --> 03:46.276
What is it with you

03:46.344 --> 03:47.424
and walking into
people's houses?

03:47.425 --> 03:48.341
Well, I knocked.

03:48.346 --> 03:49.713
I didn't hear you knock.
Well, I did,

03:49.781 --> 03:51.215
I knocked, and then I saw you

03:51.282 --> 03:52.683
through the window
and I thought you nodded.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.017
Didn't nod.

03:54.085 --> 03:55.953
Would you like me to leave?

03:56.020 --> 03:57.187
Depends. What's in the bag?

03:57.255 --> 03:58.388
Oh, those, uh,
doughnut-looking thing

03:58.456 --> 03:59.623
they sell around the block.

03:59.691 --> 04:01.358
Malasadas?
Yeah, whatever they are.

04:01.426 --> 04:03.060
They're fried and they
taste good. You want one?

04:03.127 --> 04:05.295
No. Not without bypass surgery.

04:05.363 --> 04:07.631
And you can stay.

04:07.699 --> 04:09.266
Just don't eat near my stuff.

04:09.334 --> 04:12.035
Can I have a napkin?

04:12.103 --> 04:13.871
Yeah.

04:13.938 --> 04:15.606
What was that look?
What, they teach you

04:15.673 --> 04:17.140
how not to spill in the Army?

04:17.208 --> 04:19.309
It's the Navy,
okay? The Navy.

04:19.377 --> 04:22.379
It's not the spill.

04:22.447 --> 04:24.114
It's the tie.

04:24.182 --> 04:25.849
No one in Hawaii
wears a tie.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.585
Oh, I'm sorry, I like to look
like a professional.

04:28.653 --> 04:29.586
Professional what?

04:29.654 --> 04:32.709
- Okay, this is my favorite tie.
- Mm-hmm.

04:32.712 --> 04:34.572
Grace gave me this tie
for Father's Day.

04:35.126 --> 04:37.060
Oh, and also, so you know,
back in Jersey

04:37.161 --> 04:38.729
and every normal city
in this country,

04:38.796 --> 04:40.330
this is what a detective
looks like.

04:40.398 --> 04:42.332
Really?
Yeah, really.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.067
Yeah, shirt, tie,
doughnut crumbs.

04:44.135 --> 04:45.802
You missed a spot.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.471
Look, you're never
gonna fit in here

04:47.538 --> 04:48.605
looking like you're
from the mainland.

04:48.673 --> 04:49.973
Who says I want to fit in?

04:50.041 --> 04:51.608
I don't want to fit in,
I want to look

04:51.676 --> 04:52.776
like I'm from
the mainland. Okay?

04:52.844 --> 04:53.810
I got 87 homicide cases

04:53.878 --> 04:56.280
under my belt looking like this.

04:56.347 --> 04:57.848
Not in 110-degree weather,
you don't.

04:57.916 --> 04:59.416
I'm just saying.
I'm not taking off the tie.

04:59.484 --> 05:00.450
So leave it alone.

05:00.518 --> 05:01.785
Okay.
Okay?

05:01.853 --> 05:03.654
You want to discuss
my shoes?

05:03.721 --> 05:04.988
Well, now that you mention it,

05:05.056 --> 05:06.990
patent leather loafers?

05:07.058 --> 05:09.526
Will you, uh,
do me a favor, please?

05:09.594 --> 05:11.061
Just let it go.

05:17.101 --> 05:18.468
That your dad's stuff?

05:18.536 --> 05:19.503
Yeah.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.104
You get anything from it?

05:21.172 --> 05:22.506
More questions
than answers.

05:22.573 --> 05:23.840
Talk to the Coast Guard?

05:23.908 --> 05:25.475
Yeah.

05:25.543 --> 05:27.177
Uh, they didn't find
Victor Hesse's body yet.

05:27.245 --> 05:29.746
That does not mean
that they won't.

05:29.814 --> 05:31.181
What if he's alive?

05:31.249 --> 05:32.549
You emptied a mag into the guy.

05:32.617 --> 05:33.984
Right.
He's fish food.

05:34.052 --> 05:35.285
Look, Admiral Shepard
knows that this is

05:35.353 --> 05:36.520
the guy that killed
your father.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.188
He's got crews on it 24/7.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.223
They will find Hesse's body.

05:43.695 --> 05:45.696
Yes, Governor.

05:50.635 --> 05:53.203
Kidnapping victim's
name is Roland Lowry.

05:53.271 --> 05:54.838
His car was T-boned
an hour ago.

05:54.906 --> 05:56.673
Gunshots were exchanged,
passengers were killed.

05:56.741 --> 05:58.141
This all happened
in broad daylight.

05:58.209 --> 05:59.910
Well, that seems like
a pretty messy grab

05:59.978 --> 06:01.979
just to yank an ordinary guy
off the streets.

06:02.046 --> 06:03.213
This guy's
not ordinary.

06:03.281 --> 06:04.748
Lowry's ex-NSA.

06:04.816 --> 06:06.850
He used to have top-secret
security clearance.

06:06.918 --> 06:08.251
Which means his abduction
could be

06:08.319 --> 06:09.386
a serious
national security threat.

06:09.454 --> 06:10.387
Right.

06:10.455 --> 06:11.822
What else the governor say?

06:11.889 --> 06:13.457
She said, "Find him."

06:19.497 --> 06:20.731
Hey, got your message.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.733
Good. Come on,
let's start processing.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.234
Governor's Task Force.
We'll take it from here.

06:24.302 --> 06:27.704
Chin, Kono, stay on the SUV.
Danny and I are on the van.

06:27.772 --> 06:29.573
Officer Lee.

06:31.943 --> 06:33.944
North winds must be coming in
early; I just got a chill.

06:34.012 --> 06:35.545
You know, I trained that guy

06:35.613 --> 06:37.247
and now he can't even
look me in the eye.

06:37.315 --> 06:39.616
Forget him, cousin.

06:39.684 --> 06:41.585
My police academy
graduation dinner's

06:41.652 --> 06:43.120
at Haleiwa Joe's, 7:30.

06:43.187 --> 06:44.588
Can you make it?

06:44.689 --> 06:47.190
I'll try.

06:47.258 --> 06:48.525
Car was a rental.

06:48.593 --> 06:49.760
Come on, you're
gonna make it

06:49.827 --> 06:51.194
to my graduation, right?
You know,

06:51.262 --> 06:52.929
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

06:52.997 --> 06:54.564
Between our family
and HPD...

06:54.632 --> 06:55.966
I don't care what they think.

06:56.034 --> 06:59.136
You're the reason
I became a cop.

06:59.203 --> 07:01.905
Well, a ceremony
doesn't make a cop.

07:01.973 --> 07:03.907
Doing the job makes a cop.

07:03.975 --> 07:05.776
I want you there.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.778
No, you don't.
They think I'm dirty, Kono.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.646
They're gonna paint you
with the same brush.

07:09.714 --> 07:12.015
I'm doing this for you.

07:13.551 --> 07:15.485
Stay on the car.
I'm gonna go pull the footage

07:15.553 --> 07:17.988
from that traffic camera,
see if it got anything.

07:21.225 --> 07:23.727
SS-190 armor-piercing rounds.

07:23.795 --> 07:26.296
These guys were
definitely well-backed.

07:26.364 --> 07:27.564
Definitely not a local job.

07:27.632 --> 07:28.965
What do you got?

07:29.033 --> 07:30.734
This van--
reported stolen two days ago.

07:30.802 --> 07:32.836
Two dead guys in the SUV:

07:32.904 --> 07:36.973
hired muscle from
Bruddah's private security firm.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.675
That's interesting.

07:38.743 --> 07:39.810
Why's it interesting?

07:39.877 --> 07:41.745
This is density-layer

07:41.813 --> 07:43.680
ballistic glass,

07:43.748 --> 07:45.682
laminated onto a shield
of resilient polycarbonate.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.751
Why can't you just say
"bulletproof"?

07:47.819 --> 07:49.753
I mean, how hard is that?
Get Chin to call

07:49.821 --> 07:51.321
the security company,
find out where they were going.

07:51.389 --> 07:53.423
Guys, Roland's last call was

07:53.491 --> 07:54.791
at 6:15 a.m.

07:54.859 --> 07:56.760
Same time he was abducted.
Who did he call?

07:56.828 --> 07:57.861
His son, Evan.

07:59.430 --> 08:00.931

but I was only half listening.

08:23.967 --> 08:26.335
It was some
big meeting.

08:26.403 --> 08:28.170
Do you know what it was about?

08:28.238 --> 08:30.940
Look, we don't really
talk about his work.

08:31.008 --> 08:34.010
Did your dad ever have

08:34.077 --> 08:35.443
Is there anybody

08:35.511 --> 08:36.913
that'd want to hurt your dad?

08:36.980 --> 08:38.347
No. I'm telling you,
he's the most

08:38.414 --> 08:39.916
boring person
you'll ever meet.

08:39.982 --> 08:41.583
What about your mom?
Where's she?

08:41.652 --> 08:43.953
She died when I was seven.

08:45.489 --> 08:48.424
All right, buddy, look.

08:48.492 --> 08:50.693
There was two other men
with your dad this morning.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.094
They were bodyguards.

08:52.162 --> 08:54.931
You have any idea
why he would hire bodyguards?

08:54.998 --> 08:56.198
Seriously?

08:56.266 --> 08:57.433
Yeah.

08:57.501 --> 09:00.970
Bodyguards?

09:01.038 --> 09:03.039
N-No, I have no clue.

09:05.342 --> 09:09.245
I can't believe it.

09:09.313 --> 09:12.648
That could've been the last
time I ever talk to my dad.

09:12.683 --> 09:14.951
And I called him a dictator.

09:16.887 --> 09:19.221
Evan.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.123
You all right?

09:21.191 --> 09:22.825
I'm so sorry.

09:24.294 --> 09:25.761
You okay?

09:25.829 --> 09:27.496
God, you must have
been so scared.

09:27.564 --> 09:29.665
I can't even
imagine it.

09:29.733 --> 09:31.133
You know, you're gonna come
and stay with me

09:31.201 --> 09:32.401
until they find him, yeah?

09:32.469 --> 09:33.669
Okay.

09:37.874 --> 09:40.009
Who's that?

09:40.077 --> 09:42.278
Name's Natalie Reed.
She's Roland's girlfriend.

09:42.346 --> 09:44.313
She have any guess who'd want
to grab her boyfriend?

09:44.381 --> 09:45.948
No idea.

09:46.016 --> 09:47.783
All right, stay close.
If this is a kidnap and ransom,

09:47.851 --> 09:49.452
then the abductors
might try to make contact,

09:49.519 --> 09:51.454
and if they do, I want someone
who can run the trace.

09:51.521 --> 09:53.189
Okay.
Hey, listen.

09:53.256 --> 09:55.291
Give us a couple hours,
we'll run down some leads.

09:55.359 --> 09:56.525
We will relieve you.

09:56.593 --> 09:57.860
I promise you, you won't miss

09:57.928 --> 10:00.029
your graduation.
It's cool, brah.

10:00.097 --> 10:01.964
Grabbed the video footage
from a traffic cam near

10:02.032 --> 10:03.532
the crime scene. I'll mine it,
see if there's anything

10:03.600 --> 10:05.034
on there that can help us
identify the shooters.

10:05.102 --> 10:06.469
Did you get in touch with

10:06.536 --> 10:07.803
the security company
that Roland hired today?

10:07.871 --> 10:09.438
Yeah, I spoke to the owner.

10:09.506 --> 10:10.673
Turns out,
Roland hired the bodyguards

10:10.741 --> 10:11.974
for an appointment he had

10:12.042 --> 10:13.209
this morning.

10:13.276 --> 10:14.477
Where were they going?

10:14.544 --> 10:16.012
Hickam Air Force Base.

10:16.079 --> 10:18.547
You know anyone at Hickam?

10:18.615 --> 10:20.082
A stupid question. Of course.

10:27.958 --> 10:29.658
<i>Roland became paranoid.</i>

10:29.726 --> 10:31.794
Firing off memos
in the middle of the night

10:31.862 --> 10:34.330
directly to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

10:34.398 --> 10:36.399
Which pissed off his immediate
superiors to no end.

10:36.466 --> 10:38.200
What were the memos about?

10:38.268 --> 10:42.004
He was constantly telling us how
vulnerable we were to attack.

10:42.072 --> 10:44.240
In fact, he moved to Hawaii
not to retire,

10:44.307 --> 10:45.708
but to carry on
with his work.

10:45.776 --> 10:47.977
He felt this is where
he could do the most good.

10:48.045 --> 10:49.712
What does that mean?

10:49.780 --> 10:52.815
Hawaii's in a strategic position
in the global theater.

10:52.883 --> 10:54.683
And that the United States
Pacific Command

10:54.751 --> 10:56.052
is directly responsible

10:56.119 --> 10:58.554
for 150 million
square miles.

10:58.622 --> 11:00.322
Literally half the Earth.

11:00.390 --> 11:02.425
Why do you think Pearl Harbor
was a target?

11:02.492 --> 11:04.026
Is that why he
wanted to see you?

11:04.094 --> 11:05.861
'Cause he felt we
were still vulnerable?

11:05.929 --> 11:08.164
And he said he was working on
something that could prove it.

11:08.231 --> 11:09.665
Okay, what was it?

11:09.733 --> 11:10.866
He didn't feel comfortable

11:10.934 --> 11:12.168
talking about it over the phone,

11:12.235 --> 11:13.269
so he was bringing it
over today.

11:13.336 --> 11:15.704
So Roland was about to expose

11:15.772 --> 11:17.273
some serious threat
to the island.

11:17.340 --> 11:18.908
That's why I took the meeting.

11:18.975 --> 11:21.811
That's why he was kidnapped.

11:52.642 --> 11:55.939
McGarrett.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.759
Steve we've got a wounded runner
injured in the gunfight.

11:58.372 --> 12:00.573
The tape shows he was hit
in the grab

12:00.641 --> 12:02.909
and he went into the Kahiko
on Kalia Road.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.545
Hotel security cameras show

12:27.546 --> 12:28.618
he went up the elevator
on the right.

12:28.643 --> 12:30.482
He was shot. Knew he couldn't

12:30.554 --> 12:31.677
go to the hospital.
He's looking

12:31.678 --> 12:33.479
for a place to hide and heal.
I got blood.

12:33.547 --> 12:34.680
He went up.

12:35.682 --> 12:37.016
Hey.

12:37.084 --> 12:39.585
He's on 36.

12:56.370 --> 12:59.005
Uh, we're cops. Don't worry.

13:02.543 --> 13:03.976
You like hippos?

13:04.044 --> 13:06.045
I like hippos, too.

13:06.113 --> 13:07.346
I got a daughter--

13:07.414 --> 13:09.815
she loves hippos.
Everybody likes hippos.

13:09.883 --> 13:11.517
He'll be okay.

13:13.487 --> 13:14.921
Go. Go.

13:19.726 --> 13:22.828
You have an amazing
way with children.

13:22.896 --> 13:24.363
What?

13:34.541 --> 13:36.309
Here! Here!

13:41.381 --> 13:43.349
Clear.

13:43.417 --> 13:44.984
Clear.

13:45.052 --> 13:46.452
He's on the roof.

14:03.237 --> 14:04.971
Found him.

14:17.851 --> 14:18.951
Is he dead?

14:19.019 --> 14:20.086
Not yet.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.140
Hey.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.574
Have a nice nap, Princess?

14:33.447 --> 14:34.981
Who are you?

14:35.831 --> 14:37.032
Huh?

14:37.099 --> 14:39.034
The man asked
you a question.

14:39.101 --> 14:41.669
Where's Roland Lowry?

14:41.737 --> 14:43.204
What do you want with him?

14:46.842 --> 14:50.678
Hey, you know, I've
been shot, too.

14:50.746 --> 14:53.014
Yeah, you really ought
to get that looked at.

14:53.082 --> 14:55.717
What's it been, an hour or two
since you got hit?

14:55.785 --> 14:57.919
What's gonna happen is bacterial
infection is gonna set in,

14:57.987 --> 14:59.654
and trust me,
you do not want that.

14:59.722 --> 15:01.022
It goes straight
to your bloodstream.

15:01.057 --> 15:03.691
Sepsis, organ failure.
Next thing you know,

15:03.759 --> 15:04.959
they're yanking out
your kidneys.

15:05.027 --> 15:06.694
And from what I hear,

15:06.762 --> 15:09.597
dialysis is, um, it's not fun.

15:09.665 --> 15:11.900
Let me ask
you a question.

15:11.967 --> 15:13.401
Your buddies really worth
all that trouble?

15:13.469 --> 15:15.036
Huh? I mean, you guys
couldn't have been

15:15.104 --> 15:17.739
that tight, right?
They left you behind.

15:17.807 --> 15:19.307
Danno, move.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.042
Chin, hold him down.
What are you doing?

15:25.881 --> 15:27.949
What is the matter with you?

15:28.017 --> 15:29.984
Give me a piece of paper.

15:35.024 --> 15:35.957
Run that print.

15:36.025 --> 15:38.059
Let's go.

15:40.129 --> 15:43.398
Hey, hey, Steve, what do
you think you're doing? Hey!

15:43.466 --> 15:45.166
Hey!

15:45.234 --> 15:47.836
- Are you out of your mind?!
- You want to play, huh?

15:47.903 --> 15:49.237
Let's play.
This is not Guantanamo.

15:49.305 --> 15:51.739
You can't hang a guy
off the roof.

15:51.807 --> 15:54.309
All I'd have to say is that
you came at me with a gun,

15:54.376 --> 15:57.278
we struggled and you fell.
What do you think of that, huh?

15:57.346 --> 15:58.847
Hey, listen to me,
listen to me.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.749
If a suspect dies, he no longer
has the ability to speak.

16:01.817 --> 16:03.989
Ergo, he's useless to us.

16:04.014 --> 16:05.086
You think anybody's
gonna care?

16:05.087 --> 16:06.387
You just killed
two people, buddy.

16:06.455 --> 16:08.857
I'd be doing the world a favor.
That's enough!

16:08.924 --> 16:10.458
Ladies...

16:10.526 --> 16:11.459
You can stop now.

16:11.527 --> 16:12.827
I got a fingerprint match

16:12.895 --> 16:14.496
off an Interpol database.

16:14.563 --> 16:16.099
Ergo?

16:16.100 --> 16:16.998
You and I are going
to have a long talk

16:16.999 --> 16:19.801
later, you understand?
Get him up!

16:25.284 --> 16:27.118
The guy's name is
Sergei Ivanovich.

16:27.185 --> 16:28.619
Serbian national
with a rap sheet

16:28.687 --> 16:31.122
a mile long. He's part of a gang

16:31.189 --> 16:32.790
who pulled mostly bank jobs,
jewelry heists.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.191
Smash and grab
type stuff.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.661
Thieves. Thieves take
things, not humans.

16:36.728 --> 16:37.682
Maybe they graduated
to kidnapping.

16:37.707 --> 16:38.907
Or maybe they knew what Roland

16:39.164 --> 16:40.095
wanted to show the general,

16:40.096 --> 16:41.456
and they want to get
their hands on it.

16:41.457 --> 16:43.591
Either way, take this guy to the
office, throw him in a hole.

16:43.659 --> 16:44.926
Then I want you to run
deep background.

16:44.993 --> 16:47.261
Find out when Sergei got
to the island, where he's been,

16:47.329 --> 16:48.808
all known associates,
the whole shot.

16:48.809 --> 16:49.561
Got it.

16:50.934 --> 16:51.702
Where you going?

16:51.703 --> 16:54.037
<i>We</i> are going
to Roland's house, okay?

16:54.105 --> 16:56.740
These guys are thieves--
I want to know what they were after.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.442
That way, you're going?

17:00.812 --> 17:02.179
Shut up.

17:19.030 --> 17:19.096
Let it go. Just let it go.

17:21.031 --> 17:22.598
Please do not speak
to me right now.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.935
Okay, so we're gonna do that
whole thing again? Why do we...?

17:25.002 --> 17:28.271
Will you zip it for a second?
I'm gonna speak now.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.273
It is my turn.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.509
Sergei Ivanovich--
he is a suspect.

17:32.577 --> 17:35.979
That means we treat him
as a source of information

17:36.047 --> 17:39.016
and then we book him, okay?
Torturing and killing is not part

17:39.017 --> 17:41.837
of the job description.
I wasn't going to kill him.

17:42.369 --> 17:43.604
Why are you talking?
I'm just trying to explain...

17:43.655 --> 17:45.422
Why are your lips moving?!

17:45.490 --> 17:47.024
Go ahead.

17:47.091 --> 17:50.460
I know the governor
gave you a free pass, okay?

17:50.528 --> 17:52.129
But immunity and means
does not entitle you

17:52.196 --> 17:53.430
to hang a guy
off a roof.

17:53.498 --> 17:55.032
All right, I was going
to break Ivanovich.

17:55.099 --> 17:57.868
I just needed a little time
to get into his head.

17:57.935 --> 17:59.703
That is how police work is done.

17:59.771 --> 18:02.706
Is that too theoretical
for you, huh?

18:03.908 --> 18:05.008
Can I speak?

18:05.076 --> 18:06.643
Please!
Okay.

18:06.711 --> 18:11.281
That guy was only going to talk
out of fear of death.

18:11.349 --> 18:12.849
Fear of death?

18:12.917 --> 18:14.548
Fear of death.
What does that mean, fear of death?

18:14.549 --> 18:16.516
People will tell you anything
under fear of death.

18:16.584 --> 18:18.185
That doesn't necessarily
make it true.

18:18.252 --> 18:20.787
Did you see the tattoo on his hand?
What?

18:20.855 --> 18:24.403
The blue star-- did you see
the blue star tattoo he had on his hand?

18:24.404 --> 18:26.829
That's a New Belgrade
Serbian mafia tattoo.

18:26.843 --> 18:28.407
These guys are not
smash and grab types.

18:28.446 --> 18:29.646
They kill kids.

18:29.757 --> 18:30.791
They slaughter families.

18:30.858 --> 18:33.226
That boy's going
to lose his father.

18:33.294 --> 18:36.096
Is everything going to become
a personal mission for you?

18:36.164 --> 18:37.264
You hang a guy
off a roof

18:37.331 --> 18:38.598
because you lost your father?

18:38.666 --> 18:40.000
Danny, you know what...?

18:40.067 --> 18:40.697
No, no, no, no, no.

18:40.722 --> 18:41.922
I swear to God, I
just want to know.

18:42.236 --> 18:44.738
I want to know, because if
everything is going to become

18:44.806 --> 18:46.773
a personal mission to you--
okay, I count my odds

18:46.841 --> 18:49.142
at job security,
not to mention survival,

18:49.210 --> 18:50.444
pretty slim.

18:50.511 --> 18:53.180
Okay? We are partners.

18:53.247 --> 18:55.515
So if you are going
to be the shoot first

18:55.583 --> 18:57.451
and ask questions later
type of a guy,

18:57.518 --> 18:59.152
I would at least
like to be consulted

18:59.220 --> 19:01.488
so I know when to duck.

19:06.194 --> 19:07.427
Okay.

19:07.495 --> 19:08.895
Okay.

19:11.566 --> 19:14.100
Just for the record,
I wasn't going to kill him.

19:14.168 --> 19:16.670
Well, that is good.

19:28.249 --> 19:31.985
Got security cameras,
double dead bolts,

19:32.053 --> 19:34.321
two separate entrances.

19:34.388 --> 19:36.156
Where's the automatic
gun turrets?

19:36.224 --> 19:37.491
Evan was right.

19:37.525 --> 19:39.192
Roland does take

19:39.260 --> 19:41.495
his personal security seriously.

19:41.562 --> 19:43.964
Yeah, well, it's living proof--
just because you're paranoid

19:44.031 --> 19:46.466
doesn't meant they're not
out to get you.

19:49.303 --> 19:50.537
All right, we're
looking for files,

19:50.605 --> 19:52.806
notebooks, his computer.

19:52.874 --> 19:55.175
Oh, thank you,
Inspector Obvious.

19:55.243 --> 19:57.077
I'll check the back.

20:20.968 --> 20:23.370
Fall asleep
with your eyes open again?

20:23.437 --> 20:25.438
That's funny.

20:25.506 --> 20:26.873
This wall seem

20:26.941 --> 20:28.708
weird to you?

20:28.776 --> 20:32.145
I'm not an architect, but there
should be another room here.

20:50.831 --> 20:52.832
Wow.

21:00.341 --> 21:02.108
Wow.

21:02.176 --> 21:04.277
This is slightly above
my level of expertise.

21:05.947 --> 21:07.581
What are you doing?

21:07.648 --> 21:08.582
No, no, don't touch it.

21:08.649 --> 21:10.917
Don't...
No, no, no.

21:10.985 --> 21:13.787
Good. You just put
a blip in the matrix.

21:16.157 --> 21:18.425
We need to find someone
who can make sense of this.

21:18.492 --> 21:19.893
You were Naval intelligence.

21:19.961 --> 21:21.461
None of this looks
familiar to you?

21:21.529 --> 21:23.930
No, I... Look, I've seen
super-grade level cryptography

21:23.998 --> 21:25.098
before, but this isn't it.

21:25.166 --> 21:26.499
This is--
this is something else.

21:26.567 --> 21:28.268
This is like off the grid
hacker world.

21:28.336 --> 21:30.003
Hacker? I think
I know a guy

21:30.071 --> 21:31.171
who can help us.

21:31.238 --> 21:32.939
You know a guy?

21:33.007 --> 21:34.574
Yeah, I know a guy.
I know people, too.

21:34.642 --> 21:35.842
Okay.

21:35.910 --> 21:38.178
You got any cash on you?

21:53.418 --> 21:55.419
How'd you say you know this guy?

21:55.486 --> 21:57.266
His name is Adam Charles.

21:57.267 --> 21:59.501
First case I worked
when I got here six months ago,

21:59.569 --> 22:01.003
he got busted hacking into ATMs

22:01.104 --> 22:03.205
all around the island.
Basically a good kid.

22:03.273 --> 22:05.107
He just got caught up
with some knuckleheads,

22:05.175 --> 22:07.342
and they were using him
for his skill set.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.712
Right, and your heart
just bled for him?

22:09.779 --> 22:12.781
No. I, uh... just put
a good word in with the judge.

22:12.849 --> 22:16.051
I mean, this kid had
a scholarship to MIT,

22:16.119 --> 22:17.286
the whole nine.

22:17.353 --> 22:19.388
He's really a...
a genius--

22:19.456 --> 22:21.090
at least 42 minutes
of the day.

22:21.157 --> 22:22.591
What about the
rest of the time?

22:22.659 --> 22:23.859
Baked like a potato.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.127
Ah. <i>Pakalolo.</i>

22:25.195 --> 22:26.795
Yeah, he says
it helps him

22:26.863 --> 22:30.365
see patterns, and all codes
are basically patterns.

22:34.604 --> 22:36.371
Oh, my.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.440
Dessert before dinner.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.377
Hey, Jersey.

22:42.445 --> 22:43.612
Aloha.

22:43.680 --> 22:44.913
Toast.

22:44.981 --> 22:47.549
You're looking all <i>kama'aina.</i>

22:47.617 --> 22:49.551
It's the tie, right?

22:49.619 --> 22:51.086
Really sells it.

22:51.154 --> 22:52.454
I don't know
what that means.

22:52.522 --> 22:54.490
Uh, we need a favor, Toast.

22:54.557 --> 22:56.658
Grab your stuff.
We're going for a ride.

22:57.994 --> 23:00.629
Evan, you got to eat something.

23:00.697 --> 23:02.464
Hey.

23:02.532 --> 23:04.433
Hey, Kono. We found one
of the men who grabbed Roland.

23:04.501 --> 23:05.734
He give you anything?

23:05.802 --> 23:07.169
No, but we found out
he's part

23:07.270 --> 23:08.570
of a gang of Serbian thieves.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.472
I'll e-mail you a picture.

23:11.808 --> 23:13.675
Listen, you think you can talk
to Evan?

23:13.743 --> 23:15.310
Ask him if he knows this guy

23:15.378 --> 23:16.812
or anything
about his dad's business.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.514
International contacts,
overseas phone calls,

23:18.581 --> 23:21.450
anything that might be able
to tie Roland to the Serbs.

23:21.518 --> 23:22.684
Yeah, sure, I'll try.

23:22.752 --> 23:24.253
How's the kid doing?

23:24.320 --> 23:26.155
About as well as can
be expected, considering.

23:26.222 --> 23:27.656
How about you?

23:27.724 --> 23:29.024
I'm fine. Why?

23:29.092 --> 23:30.692
Well, you're cutting it
kind of close.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.594
You might miss your graduation.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.929
No worries.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.764
You become a cop
by doing the work,

23:35.832 --> 23:37.132
not walking
across a stage, right?

23:37.200 --> 23:40.135
Good news is,
you're off the hook.

23:40.203 --> 23:42.371
You don't have to be there.

23:42.438 --> 23:44.139
Well, good luck with the kid.

23:44.207 --> 23:45.340
Thanks.

23:45.408 --> 23:46.642
Any news?

23:46.709 --> 23:48.310
Nothing concrete.

23:48.378 --> 23:50.479
He won't eat. He won't talk.

23:50.547 --> 23:53.182
I'm really worried
about him.

23:54.217 --> 23:56.285
Do you have any paper?

23:56.352 --> 23:59.822
Oh, your kidnapped dude's
got a sweet setup.

23:59.889 --> 24:01.824
Yo, take
your time, Toast.

24:01.891 --> 24:03.692
I mean, it's-it's... it's
just national security.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.861
I'll take my time
and do it right.

24:05.929 --> 24:08.430
Can I smoke in here, guys?

24:08.498 --> 24:10.032
No.
No.

24:10.099 --> 24:11.533
Harsh.

24:15.271 --> 24:16.972
No way.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.173
This is unreal.

24:18.241 --> 24:20.843
Like unicorn style.

24:20.910 --> 24:23.478
I mean, I've heard rumors
about this guy online,

24:23.546 --> 24:25.948
but I thought it was all
just urban legend.

24:28.918 --> 24:30.819
He really did it.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.754
Did what? What did he do?

24:32.822 --> 24:36.358
Okay. He built a skeleton key.

24:36.426 --> 24:37.759
It's basically a worm

24:37.827 --> 24:39.595
that can bypass
asymmetric encryption

24:39.662 --> 24:41.363
on high-grade security networks,

24:41.431 --> 24:44.366
and also allows remote access
to infrastructure systems.

24:44.434 --> 24:45.767
Great.

24:45.835 --> 24:48.570
You want to dumb it down
for my friend here?

24:48.638 --> 24:50.739
Just look.

24:51.975 --> 24:54.276
Wait, wait, wait.

24:54.344 --> 24:56.178
That's a rendering
of the power grid

24:56.246 --> 24:58.380
of the entire island of Oahu.

24:58.448 --> 25:01.884
And the radar array for
Honolulu International Airport.

25:01.951 --> 25:04.887
- What did Roland do?
-  I don't know.

25:04.954 --> 25:08.123
But you're talking about places
with heavy-grade

25:08.191 --> 25:09.958
asymmetric encryption,

25:10.026 --> 25:11.894
and your boy here
hacked them.

25:11.961 --> 25:14.529
All with this computer,
Roland did that?

25:14.597 --> 25:15.964
No.

25:16.032 --> 25:17.733
I mean, this is all
just archives--

25:17.800 --> 25:20.269
logs of what he did.

25:20.336 --> 25:23.572
Skeleton key's definitely
not on these drives.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.307
My guess is...

25:26.843 --> 25:28.744
...it was right in there.
Okay.

25:28.811 --> 25:31.079
At least we know what he wanted
to show General Nathanson--

25:31.147 --> 25:32.781
the skeleton key
and what it could do.

25:32.849 --> 25:34.549
Okay, so hold on--
if Roland can hack

25:34.584 --> 25:35.817
into the island infrastructure,

25:35.885 --> 25:38.053
any government
network computer...

25:38.121 --> 25:39.955
And whoever has him
can do the same.

25:43.826 --> 25:45.727
What are you making?

25:45.795 --> 25:47.729
A crane.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.765
In Japan, it's a
symbol of peace,

25:49.832 --> 25:51.600
honor and loyalty.

25:51.668 --> 25:53.735
I once had to make
1,000 of them

25:53.803 --> 25:55.437
for my cousin's wedding
in Kyoto.

25:55.505 --> 25:56.805
Whoa. 1,000?

25:56.873 --> 25:58.640
Yeah. It's kind
of a thing.

25:58.708 --> 26:01.276
You ever, uh,
been out of the country?

26:01.344 --> 26:04.279
No. We never go anywhere.

26:04.347 --> 26:07.049
Hawaii's the farthest
from Virginia we've ever been.

26:09.852 --> 26:12.120
Do you, um...

26:12.188 --> 26:15.290
do you recognize this guy?

26:15.358 --> 26:17.259
No.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.795
Is he the man who took my dad?

26:19.862 --> 26:21.229
We think he's one of them, yes.

26:22.265 --> 26:23.765
We got him.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.001
And we'll get the others,
I promise you.

26:30.540 --> 26:33.108
Do you think I could try
to make one of those?

26:33.176 --> 26:34.376
I'd love to teach you.

26:34.444 --> 26:36.044
Let me get a piece of paper.

26:37.714 --> 26:39.848
Sergei flew in from Serbia
two months ago.

26:39.916 --> 26:41.883
- Alone?
- No.

26:41.951 --> 26:44.286
He came in
with a Drago Zankovic.

26:44.354 --> 26:45.887
He's the boss,
as far as I can tell.

26:45.955 --> 26:47.322
He, uh, paid for the tickets.

26:47.390 --> 26:48.957
They both traveled
on doctored passports.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.293
There were three guys
on the traffic cam.

26:51.361 --> 26:52.694
Let's go a little further back.

26:52.762 --> 26:54.329
Show me all Serbian passports
in Hawaii

26:54.397 --> 26:56.098
in the last six months.
Yeah, one sec.

26:58.134 --> 26:59.368
Hey, Natalie,
do you have another

26:59.435 --> 27:00.836
piece of paper?
In the top drawer.

27:00.903 --> 27:02.504
I just put some
water on for tea.

27:02.572 --> 27:03.805
Do you want some?

27:03.873 --> 27:05.107
Yeah, sure.

27:23.726 --> 27:26.161
Blow that one up.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.563
Nadia Lukovic.

27:28.631 --> 27:30.098
AKA Natalie.

27:34.437 --> 27:36.538
Everything okay?

27:36.606 --> 27:38.573
Yeah, everything's fine.

27:39.609 --> 27:41.343
Evan's okay?

27:41.411 --> 27:42.844
Yeah, he's hanging in there.

28:51.714 --> 28:52.914
Hey!

28:52.982 --> 28:54.983
Let her go.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.220
I said let her go.

29:03.059 --> 29:04.493
Come on.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.995
We're all going to
take ride together.

29:24.445 --> 29:25.678
Turn left ahead.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.353
You shouldn't have
involved the boy.

29:29.354 --> 29:31.421
Well, you should have done
a better job.

29:31.489 --> 29:33.390
You could have
convinced him to sell it

29:33.458 --> 29:35.325
on the open market.

29:35.393 --> 29:37.995
More time? It's been months.

29:38.062 --> 29:41.131
He was about to hand it over
to the U.S. military.

29:41.199 --> 29:43.734
You've been watching my dad
for months?

29:45.970 --> 29:48.172
It's my boss.

29:48.239 --> 29:49.406
If I don't answer,

29:49.474 --> 29:51.175
he'll know something's wrong.

29:51.242 --> 29:53.410
Tell him everything is fine,

29:53.478 --> 29:56.013
or the boy won't see
his next birthday.

29:58.883 --> 30:00.250
Steve.

30:00.318 --> 30:01.351
Kono, am I on speaker?

30:01.419 --> 30:02.753
No.

30:02.820 --> 30:04.588
Natalie's working
with the Serbs.

30:04.656 --> 30:06.657
We're on the way to her house.
Where are you?

30:06.724 --> 30:08.325
Yeah, everything's great.

30:08.393 --> 30:10.294
Copy that. Just stay on the line

30:10.361 --> 30:11.962
as long as you can.
We're running a trace.

30:12.030 --> 30:13.630
This is Chin Ho Kelly.
I need a priority trace.

30:13.698 --> 30:15.465
Kono, can you tell us
where you are?

30:15.533 --> 30:17.935
Yeah, I may even take Evan out
to Mokuleia Beach for a swim.

30:18.002 --> 30:19.503
Okay, you're headed north.

30:19.571 --> 30:21.605
Exactly.

30:21.673 --> 30:23.540
I know what you're doing.

30:26.444 --> 30:28.111
Now, take a hard left.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.027
Dad!
Evan.

30:46.197 --> 30:47.898
Dad!

30:52.403 --> 30:53.904
Natalie.

30:53.972 --> 30:55.672
What are you doing?
She's one of them, Dad!

30:55.740 --> 30:56.974
No.

30:57.041 --> 30:58.542
No, no!
No, that can't be!

30:58.610 --> 30:59.977
Oh, shut up!

31:00.078 --> 31:04.081
You see, your father has
not been very cooperative,

31:04.148 --> 31:05.549
but now, with you here,

31:05.617 --> 31:08.518
maybe you can talk
some sense into him, huh?

31:08.586 --> 31:10.254
Tell him to do what we ask.
All right, all right.

31:10.321 --> 31:12.990
All right, all right. You win.

31:13.057 --> 31:15.225
I'll do what you want.
Just please, don't hurt my son!

31:15.293 --> 31:17.327
Dad!

31:17.395 --> 31:18.562
- Leave him alone!
- Shut up!

31:18.630 --> 31:20.931
Sit down!

31:23.601 --> 31:25.235
Okay. Okay.

31:25.303 --> 31:27.004
Okay, okay.

31:28.273 --> 31:29.940
Come on.

31:30.008 --> 31:31.808
Now, get to work.

31:47.458 --> 31:49.726
No, no, no, no, no.

31:56.301 --> 31:57.701
Yeah, Toast, what's up?

31:57.769 --> 31:59.036
Jersey, look,

31:59.103 --> 32:00.771
I don't want
to freak you out, but...

32:00.838 --> 32:02.739
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Take the
lollipop out of your mouth.

32:02.807 --> 32:04.608
I can't understand a word.
Look, I don't want

32:04.676 --> 32:05.876
to freak you out,
but it looks like

32:05.943 --> 32:07.611
the skeleton key just went live.

32:07.679 --> 32:08.912
Okay. What does that mean?

32:08.980 --> 32:10.981
Someone's using it, dude.

32:11.049 --> 32:12.416
No, no, no.

32:12.483 --> 32:14.217
That's problematic.

32:14.285 --> 32:15.786
What is problematic?

32:15.853 --> 32:17.054
The radar just went down.

32:17.121 --> 32:18.288
Can we trace the hack?

32:18.356 --> 32:19.790
No, I can't pinpoint the origin.

32:19.857 --> 32:22.225
Whatever it is just took down

32:22.293 --> 32:24.461
the Honolulu approach radar.
Why do that?

32:24.529 --> 32:26.963
So someone can fly
in or out undetected.

32:36.074 --> 32:38.408
Make sure the radar
is down until they land.

32:38.476 --> 32:40.277
Got it?

32:40.345 --> 32:44.114
What are they
making him do?

32:44.182 --> 32:45.982
As soon as he's done,

32:46.050 --> 32:47.584
do you think they'll let us go?

32:47.652 --> 32:49.953
Hey. I told you to be quiet.

32:50.021 --> 32:51.555
Hey, leave him alone.

32:52.690 --> 32:54.624
Huh?

32:56.561 --> 32:58.729
Leave him alone, scumbag.

33:05.203 --> 33:07.604
Nah, not yet.
She's a good hostage.

33:07.672 --> 33:09.840
<i>My</i> hostage!

33:09.907 --> 33:11.108
Get her back in the chair.

33:11.175 --> 33:13.977
Hey, get back to work.

33:20.518 --> 33:21.685
You're dead.

33:21.753 --> 33:23.887
It's just a matter
of time.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.527
Sorry.

33:45.643 --> 33:47.878
Did you catch that?
Yeah, no markings, no tail number.

33:47.945 --> 33:49.246
You were right.
Not one of ours.

33:49.313 --> 33:50.847
Okay, so where the
hell did it come from?

33:50.915 --> 33:52.916
I don't know, but I think
I know where it's going.

33:52.984 --> 33:54.184
There's a skydiving school
around here.

33:54.252 --> 33:55.752
Skydiving?
That's right, there is.

33:55.853 --> 33:57.187
It's gotta land somewhere,
right?

33:57.255 --> 33:58.989
Dillingham Airfield.
That's where they are.

34:26.114 --> 34:27.248
Where is it?

34:27.315 --> 34:28.783
Let's see the money first.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.360
Looks... looks
like it's all here.

34:41.764 --> 34:43.498
This way, gentlemen.

34:57.079 --> 34:58.613
How are we taking the building?

34:58.680 --> 35:00.047
What do you think?

35:00.115 --> 35:03.694
I think if we can get our eyes
on our people, we go in hot.

35:03.695 --> 35:04.996
Is that what you would do?

35:05.063 --> 35:06.797
Yes, that is what I would do.

35:06.865 --> 35:08.099
See? This is a partnership.

35:08.166 --> 35:09.634
It's like pulling teeth,

35:09.701 --> 35:10.935
you know that?
Come on.

35:11.003 --> 35:12.470
Let's go.

35:19.845 --> 35:22.546
Here it is, as you requested.

35:27.019 --> 35:29.520
- Dad?
- Yeah?

35:30.989 --> 35:34.125
I'm sorry
I called you a dictator.

35:34.192 --> 35:38.629
It's okay. It's <i>okay.</i>

36:07.926 --> 36:10.061
♪ ♪

36:55.507 --> 36:56.841
Hey, both of you.

36:56.908 --> 36:58.743
Hey, listen to me.
Get ready

36:58.810 --> 36:59.910
to hit the ground.

36:59.978 --> 37:01.278
When?

37:01.346 --> 37:03.080
You'll know when. Just do it.

37:04.082 --> 37:05.383
You want to
take her out?

37:05.450 --> 37:06.951
Take her out.

37:45.190 --> 37:47.291
Everybody out now,
now, now, now!

37:48.126 --> 37:50.060
Let's go! Let's go!

38:04.209 --> 38:06.277
Hey, hey!

38:06.344 --> 38:08.412
Eddie, Eddie,
Eddie,

38:08.480 --> 38:09.513
I got you.

38:09.581 --> 38:11.449
I got you.

38:11.516 --> 38:13.350
Hands up. Hands up.

38:14.486 --> 38:16.420
Stand up.

38:16.488 --> 38:18.088
Hands behind your back.

38:18.156 --> 38:20.391
I got you.

38:25.197 --> 38:27.498
You had me worried

38:27.566 --> 38:28.999
for a second
there, cuz.

38:29.067 --> 38:30.734
I had it all under control.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.648
Book him, Danno.

38:44.716 --> 38:47.351
Really? I mean,
is that gonna be a thing now?

38:47.419 --> 38:48.619
You don't like it?

38:48.687 --> 38:49.987
Don't like it.

38:50.055 --> 38:51.822
I think it's catchy.

38:51.890 --> 38:54.191
What are you looking at?
What's the matter with you?

38:54.259 --> 38:56.694
What? What? What? Walk.

39:27.125 --> 39:29.126
♪ ♪

40:14.639 --> 40:17.808
Go ahead.

40:22.314 --> 40:24.782
A Kel-Tec nine-mil.

40:24.849 --> 40:27.651
Very nice.

40:27.719 --> 40:29.286
Makes for a good
backup weapon.

40:29.354 --> 40:31.455
Keep it in your belt,
your ankle strap.

40:31.523 --> 40:33.757
Doesn't need
a separate holster.

40:33.825 --> 40:35.492
Thanks, boss.

40:37.562 --> 40:40.164
I'm sorry you were put
in danger today.

40:40.231 --> 40:42.266
We care for each
other like a family,

40:42.334 --> 40:44.969
so please know we'll always
do everything we can

40:45.036 --> 40:46.403
to protect you.

40:52.811 --> 40:54.144
He's the patron saint...

40:54.212 --> 40:56.146
...of law enforcement.

40:56.214 --> 40:58.582
I've seen cops wear 'em.
Pretty sure with that

40:58.650 --> 41:00.351
roundhouse kick you're never
gonna need it.

41:00.366 --> 41:02.616
My sergeant gave me one when
I graduated from the Academy.

41:02.754 --> 41:04.655
I've always
kept it on me.

41:04.723 --> 41:06.690
It's always kept me safe.

41:06.758 --> 41:08.225
That is, until I met him.

41:15.533 --> 41:19.336
You really proved
yourself out there today.

41:19.404 --> 41:21.338
You've earned this.

41:31.616 --> 41:33.784
And for the record,

41:33.852 --> 41:37.454
I wouldn't have missed
your graduation for anything.

41:39.557 --> 41:42.559
Now, raise your right hand.

41:44.396 --> 41:47.064
I solemnly swear...

41:47.132 --> 41:48.866

the Constitution and laws

41:48.933 --> 41:50.834

of Hawaii.

41:53.071 --> 41:54.705
I solemnly swear

41:54.773 --> 41:57.908
to faithfully support the laws
and Constitution...
