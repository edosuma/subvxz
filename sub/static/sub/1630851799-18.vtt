26:10.369 --> 26:11.704
- No.
- Not at all.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.240
- I do know that
this is a thing.

26:14.273 --> 26:17.242
I did call a
meeting, if you will,

26:17.277 --> 26:21.114
without Erika, because
I was in a nervous place.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.249
But I'm not going
to apologize for it,

26:23.282 --> 26:26.920
because I was only
asking questions.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.688
And you really did
hurt my feelings.

26:28.721 --> 26:31.423
And you were scary that
night at Kathy's dinner.

26:31.458 --> 26:34.693
- Don't call me a liar.
- I didn't call you a liar.

26:34.728 --> 26:37.329
- You called me
a liar. I'm not a liar.

26:37.364 --> 26:40.133
- I didn't say,
"Erika's a liar."

26:40.165 --> 26:42.669
- She call me a liar?

26:42.701 --> 26:44.770
- You lied about
the broken foot.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.905
But you didn't say
about the brain thing.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.142
That's where the
"lie" part comes in.

26:49.174 --> 26:52.278
- I'm not a liar. I don't care
that you think I'm scary.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.146
- Well, I know that you don't.
- I don't.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.467
- I'm just telling
you how I felt.

26:56.468 --> 27:00.787
- Right. I don't care. Why
are you speaking to me?

27:00.819 --> 27:03.890
I have nothing to
say to you. Zero.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.357
- Okay, Miss Small Town.

27:05.392 --> 27:07.599
- Miss Small Town?
That's you, honey.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.328
- Girl, you're--
- Small-minded. "You're" what?

27:09.362 --> 27:10.864
"Girl" what? "Girl" what?

27:10.896 --> 27:13.767
- Okay. Call me small-minded.
- Small-minded.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.167
- If it makes you feel better...

27:15.201 --> 27:17.303
- What are we doing here?
- To put me down.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.837
- I'm not putting you down.
You called me a liar, honey.

27:18.872 --> 27:20.173
- Really? You just
called me small-minded.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.776
- Yes, it is.
- That is really insulting.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.477
- All right, I'm not giving
this any more energy,

27:24.510 --> 27:26.311
because it doesn't really
need it; this is dumb.

27:26.346 --> 27:30.817
- Everybody, just one second.
Can we give a little forgiving?

27:30.849 --> 27:34.319
Because I think that she
chose the wrong word,

27:34.354 --> 27:37.757
'cause I don't think she would
really call somebody a liar.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.588
- No.
- Okay.

27:39.589 --> 27:40.894
So this is supposed to be
fixing things, so if it's not--

27:40.926 --> 27:42.796
- It's not working.
- It's not working.

27:42.828 --> 27:47.133
- You guys, I've told you
guys it's not going to be fixed.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.101
- Erika was honest today.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.805
For her, right now,
the door is closed.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.339
She's dealing with a lot.

27:53.373 --> 27:57.176
And this for her is just
crossing a line. And for her--

27:57.210 --> 27:59.788
- There's a lot of
crossing of lines.

27:59.789 --> 28:01.181
- I don't know what that means.
- I think she crossed a line.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.160
- So I just wanted to
finish this thought here.

28:03.490 --> 28:05.384
- I'm just trying to--no,
what I'm trying to figure out

28:05.417 --> 28:08.188
is why I'm being made
out to be like the bad guy.

28:08.221 --> 28:10.190
- I don't think you
are the main one.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.724
- If you let me
finish this thought,

28:11.758 --> 28:13.226
I'm trying to actually help you.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.160
- Okay.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.288
- And I'm trying to
say something nice.

28:16.289 --> 28:17.230
- Everybody is--everybody
is coming after her.

28:17.262 --> 28:18.464
- [inaudible]. It's just that--

28:18.498 --> 28:19.766
- Everybody is
saying, "Tell the truth.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.338
Tell the truth. Tell the truth."

28:21.339 --> 28:22.736
- No one is coming after her.
- Trying to help me do what?

28:22.769 --> 28:24.203
- This is not an
attack on Sutton.

28:24.237 --> 28:25.538
- I'm not saying you're
attacking on Sutton.

28:25.571 --> 28:26.905
But I'm saying,
at Kathy's house,

28:26.940 --> 28:28.741
it felt like it was
skewed to Sutton.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.743
- Sutton, you said...
- That I was a liar?

28:30.777 --> 28:33.212
- "Next time I see Erika,
I'm gonna be honest with her

28:33.246 --> 28:35.115
and be straight up.
I think she's lied."

28:35.147 --> 28:36.516
And you're not being honest.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.219
And you're putting
us in a bad position.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.753
- You've been in this
group long enough.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.388
You should know and understand

28:42.422 --> 28:45.224
that it's in an
attempt to help her.

28:45.258 --> 28:47.426
Do you understand?

28:47.460 --> 28:51.530
I know you can pretend
that that's not the case.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.132
But it actually is.

28:53.133 --> 28:55.134
- So by you saying, "Tell
the truth, tell the truth,

28:55.167 --> 28:58.203
tell the truth, tell the truth"
is to help her in the long run?

28:58.238 --> 29:00.539
- Yes.
<i>- How is that helping her?</i>

29:00.573 --> 29:02.909
Pushing someone is helping them?

29:03.900 --> 29:06.211
This feels like exactly
what happened with Denise.

29:06.246 --> 29:09.114
- Denise, you have
chosen to sit here,

29:09.115 --> 29:11.169
then you need to ----in' own it.

29:11.170 --> 29:14.421
- I have owned it, and
it's not good enough.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.220
- Sutton, do you feel helped?

29:16.559 --> 29:22.279
Erika, do you feel
helped? It's a no. Gotcha.

29:22.619 --> 29:24.830
- Be honest about
what she just said.

29:24.864 --> 29:25.898
- Gotcha.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.200
- I mean, Garcelle, when we were

29:27.232 --> 29:28.468
at Kyle's Christmas party...
- Yeah.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.536
- And you were
sitting next to me...

29:29.568 --> 29:30.903
- Yeah.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.439
- You too turned
around to me and said,

29:32.471 --> 29:34.106
"That's not what you
said the other night.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.607
That's not what you
said the other night."

29:35.642 --> 29:37.443
- No one is looking to...
- No one.

29:37.477 --> 29:38.845
- Pry into...

29:38.877 --> 29:40.459
- That's not what you
said the other night.

29:40.460 --> 29:41.314
- I think anyone
will understand--

29:41.347 --> 29:42.915
- That's not what you
said the other night.

29:42.949 --> 29:43.916
That's not what you
said the other night.

29:43.950 --> 29:44.851
- Let me finish.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.486
- No, you're still
carrying that torch.

29:46.519 --> 29:48.121
I thought everything was--
- No. I'm making a point,

29:48.153 --> 29:50.190
because Garcelle is
saying that everyone's--

29:50.222 --> 29:52.578
But when she does it, it's okay.

29:52.579 --> 29:54.598
- Dorit, come on.

29:54.599 --> 29:55.929
<i>I'm just getting a little bit...</i>

29:55.961 --> 29:58.640
[sighs]

29:58.980 --> 30:03.435
It's just too much back
and forth and just nitpicking

30:03.470 --> 30:10.343
and the--what is it, the
camel with the--what is it?

30:10.376 --> 30:12.578
The toe with the camel's back?

30:14.346 --> 30:17.983
- The straw that
breaks the camel's back.

30:18.180 --> 30:19.352
- I think it's still
hurt feelings.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.653
- Is there a point to say?

30:20.686 --> 30:22.154
Are you talking
about, still, Sutton?

30:22.188 --> 30:23.155
- I think there's
some hurt feelings...

30:23.189 --> 30:24.190
- Yeah.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.191
- With you and Dorit.
- Yeah.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.589
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:26.920 --> 30:27.599
- But I thought
you all got over it.

30:27.930 --> 30:28.862
- I don't think there's
still hurt feelings.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.195
- I thought so too,
but apparently not.

30:30.230 --> 30:33.566
- Well, I mean, listen, I think
that it rears its ugly head.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.602
And I think that sometimes
we have conversations

30:35.634 --> 30:38.270
and you know how
I feel. I told you.

30:38.304 --> 30:41.273
- Yeah.
- To me, I prefer my friends

30:41.307 --> 30:44.099
to be upfront, honest,
and transparent.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.109
- Right.

30:45.450 --> 30:46.346
- Because that's how
you can actually create

30:46.378 --> 30:47.681
real friendships.
- Great.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.150
- Garcelle, let me
ask you real question.

30:49.490 --> 30:51.351
- Yeah.
- You have shared that

30:51.384 --> 30:53.252
you don't feel
comfortable in this group.

30:53.286 --> 30:55.555
- I didn't say uncomfortable;
I said I didn't feel accepted.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.230
- Okay. You didn't
feel accepted?

30:57.569 --> 30:59.291
So do you like the
women at this table?

30:59.325 --> 31:00.359
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

31:00.393 --> 31:03.496
- Some more than others.
- Okay.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.650
- If you want to be included,

31:05.980 --> 31:08.401
you really need to make
an effort to be a friend.

31:08.434 --> 31:11.304
<i>I have known Garcelle
for over 20 years.</i>

31:11.337 --> 31:14.540
And I think that we've
all really made an effort

31:14.574 --> 31:17.544
<i>to make Garcelle feel more
comfortable in this group.</i>

31:17.576 --> 31:20.413
We had a birthday
for her at my house.

31:20.446 --> 31:23.583
- Yes!
- Let me see. Let me see.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.385
- Yes!
<i>- But here's the thing,</i>

31:26.419 --> 31:28.153
friendship is a two-way street.

31:28.188 --> 31:30.557
And Garcelle didn't even
know about Kyle's birthday.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.960
- It's Kyle's birthday.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

31:33.992 --> 31:35.949
- Yeah.
- Did you know?

31:35.950 --> 31:38.130
- Yeah.
- If you want a friend,

31:38.131 --> 31:39.561
you need to be a friend.

31:39.562 --> 31:41.201
So she has to make an effort.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.102
For you to come out and say,

31:43.103 --> 31:46.439
"These women are coming
after me," it wasn't cool, Garcelle.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.407
- Who doesn't feel
that I don't like them?

31:48.441 --> 31:50.242
- I certainly do.
- I feel you like me.

31:50.276 --> 31:52.111
I feel like everybody
likes me. I ask myself that.

31:52.112 --> 31:53.613
- I don't even know
why that's a question.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.415
I don't go, "Do you like me?"
- Garcelle, I know you.

31:56.449 --> 31:58.317
You need to be more straight up.

31:58.351 --> 32:00.420
- Come on. Give me a
----ing break. Get out of here.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.188
- Garcelle--
- Get out of here.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.457
- No, I'm not. You need to be
straight with her how you feel.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.459
You need to be straight,
'cause you can be shady.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.295
- We all can be shady.
- Garcelle, just be honest.

32:09.328 --> 32:13.633
<i>♪ ♪</i>

32:13.666 --> 32:15.201
<i>- Coming up...</i>

32:15.234 --> 32:18.709
- They want to put
him in a mental facility.

32:18.710 --> 32:19.105
You know, like, a--
- Oh.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.105
How do you feel about that?

32:20.140 --> 32:27.713
- Girl, I'm ready to have
a nervous breakdown.

32:27.747 --> 32:32.251
- Just be honest,
Garcelle, how do you feel?

32:32.285 --> 32:33.519
I got to get to
the bottom of it,

32:33.552 --> 32:35.121
'cause I watched you at a table.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.900
Oh, I have is this
moment. But I go, "Listen..."

32:37.901 --> 32:40.929
- At Dorit's?
- Yes. I don't know.

32:40.930 --> 32:41.528
Genuinely, I don't
know how you feel.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.262
I guess when you
say that you feel like

32:43.296 --> 32:44.564
you're an outsider, to me,

32:44.596 --> 32:47.299
it feels like you're
not really interested

32:47.334 --> 32:49.402
or invested in
building friendships.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.136
- That is so not true.

32:51.171 --> 32:52.672
When I was having
that conversation,

32:52.705 --> 32:56.241
did anybody come up and
say, "Hey, how are you doing?"

32:56.276 --> 32:58.411
- Yeah. But, Garcelle,
I was confronting you

32:58.444 --> 33:00.380
on something you
were doing to me.

33:00.413 --> 33:03.249
- How I feel doesn't
negate how you feel.

33:03.282 --> 33:04.384
- I appreciate that.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.353
- When you were saying
those things, no one spoke up.

33:06.385 --> 33:10.323
It made me feel like I
was on an island by myself.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.424
Already being the
only Black person in this

33:12.459 --> 33:14.426
group--and it's not about
race. It's not about race.

33:14.461 --> 33:17.830
But already being
the only one here,

33:17.864 --> 33:23.769
have you guys ever thought
that maybe it's a little odd for me?

33:23.803 --> 33:26.205
- I have, but I
don't verbalize it.

33:26.239 --> 33:27.207
- But if you don't verbalize it,

33:27.240 --> 33:29.108
how am I supposed to know?

33:29.142 --> 33:31.711
Just because I'm strong doesn't
mean that I don't have feelings

33:31.744 --> 33:34.748
and I'm not fragile and
I'm not trying to fit in.

33:34.780 --> 33:40.119
My whole life ----ing
life, I've had to try to fit in.

33:41.621 --> 33:43.690
- But you fit in here.
- You do fit in.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.826
- It doesn't always
feel like that.

33:46.859 --> 33:48.361
I walk in a room all the time,

33:48.394 --> 33:50.396
and I always have
to prove myself.

33:50.430 --> 33:52.231
Have you guys ever
walked into a room

33:52.265 --> 33:54.701
and felt like you're the
only one that's different?

33:54.733 --> 33:59.239
- Yeah.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.807
- Try it your whole life.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.474
- I'm really glad
you're saying this.

34:02.509 --> 34:04.611
- I am too. I think this is
so--thank you for sharing this.

34:04.644 --> 34:06.346
- I really am glad
that you're saying this.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.480
- Yeah.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.248
- Thank you, Garcelle,
for sharing this.

34:09.282 --> 34:11.418
I like seeing Garcelle
in this moment,

34:11.451 --> 34:14.454
even though I feel bad
that she experiences that.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.856
- You're brave, and you're good.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.724
And everything's okay.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.726
<i>- Because by letting
your guard down</i>

34:20.760 --> 34:24.731

- Yeah.

43:32.878 --> 43:34.246
- Yeah. I understand.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.748
- Want to know who
your friends are?

43:35.782 --> 43:39.385
Get old and go broke.

43:39.418 --> 43:40.887
<i>- Next time on</i>

43:40.920 --> 43:41.954
<i>"The Real Housewives

We're ready for some vino.

43:43.956 --> 43:46.358

44:01.273 --> 44:04.777
I mean, it's ----ing bullsh--.

Like, I'll never
forget when you said,

"I paid the rent this month."

44:09.849 --> 44:11.150
- I know.

44:11.184 --> 44:12.686
- I couldn't believe she
was speaking to you.

44:12.719 --> 44:14.538
It's almost like
nothing had happened.

44:14.539 --> 44:16.155
- Do I trust it?

44:16.188 --> 44:18.891
- Hey! I can hear everything
you're saying about me.

44:18.925 --> 44:20.599
- [silently]
