00:18.852 --> 00:23.565
Hundreds of villages
like this one have paused...

00:23.649 --> 00:28.779
..to celebrate the transportation
of our people to this great new land.

00:30.489 --> 00:34.159
We are especially honoured today...

00:34.243 --> 00:38.705
..by the presence of those responsible
for finding this planet for us...

00:38.789 --> 00:42.292
..and saving us from certain doom.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.754
How can we ever repay them?

00:45.838 --> 00:49.591
By not boring them with
long speeches, Hedrazar.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.848
I meant what I said.

00:55.973 --> 01:00.686
- You are all heroes to my people.
- It was our pleasure.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.188
When my grandchild arrives,...

01:03.272 --> 01:08.318
..it will be the first Enkaran
to be born in our new homeland.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.489
We will name the child after you, Colonel.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.663
Eliam, it's getting cold.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.666
It seems to be getting colder
since you last visited.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.003
Our atmospheric-monitoring
equipment is indicating that.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.922
We only had a short time
to assess the conditions,...

01:29.006 --> 01:32.759
..but it appears you may be in for
a more severe winter than we predicted.

01:32.885 --> 01:36.138
We are a hearty people. We will survive.

01:36.221 --> 01:39.183
The naqahdah reactor
should provide enough energy...

01:39.266 --> 01:41.643
..to heat your new city for a year.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.733
Well, you've certainly
accomplished a lot already.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.569
And it has only been
but one cycle of the moon.

01:50.652 --> 01:54.823
Come back in a year and you
will find this planet transformed.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.327
Help! Help me, please!

01:58.452 --> 02:01.872
- What is it?
- It is Caleb. He comes from the west.

02:07.544 --> 02:13.717
It's so big. It destroyed our whole village!
You must all flee!

02:13.800 --> 02:17.554
What are you talking about?
Caleb, catch your breath.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.683
- It comes this way.
- What does?

02:23.477 --> 02:25.938
You must see it.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.321
There.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.073
Whoa.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.420
What is it?

04:20.636 --> 04:23.805
We estimate the ship to be
about two miles in diameter.

04:23.889 --> 04:28.268
The curtain of energy it's using to sweep
the landscape stretches for over 20 miles.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.396
It seems to be depositing
an unknown gas-like substance...

04:31.480 --> 04:34.024
..that is spreading
like a wake behind the ship.

04:34.149 --> 04:38.612
It extends beyond the range of the UAV,
but it appears to cover hundreds of miles.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.906
Teal'c hasn't seen the technology before.

04:41.031 --> 04:44.451
We're waiting for the analysis
of the atmospheric samples,...

04:44.535 --> 04:47.955
..but you can see the damage being done.

04:51.083 --> 04:55.295
There don't appear to be any
recognisable markings on the ship.

04:55.379 --> 04:58.131
It would appear that
whoever's in control...

04:58.215 --> 05:01.301
..doesn't have the intention
of attacking the Enkarans.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.428
Why do you say that?

05:03.554 --> 05:06.557
It just seems it would be
a more direct approach.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.643
- What difference does it make?
- The colonel is right.

05:09.726 --> 05:15.482
Based on the ship's speed, I estimate it'll
take 26 hours to reach Hedrazar's village.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.943
But it'll take out the Stargate first.

05:18.068 --> 05:22.531
- Can we evacuate the Enkarans in time?
- Teal'c's preppin' 'em right now.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.658
The concern is where to send them.

05:24.783 --> 05:28.871
Even low levels of radiation
can cause the Enkarans to go blind.

05:28.954 --> 05:32.791
Without the density of ozone on
this particular planet, they'll all die.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.253
The only planet with similar
conditions is their home world.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.840
According to Enkaran verbal history,
there's no Stargate there.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.885
The Goa'uld kidnapped
their ancestors with ships.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.637
Even if we had transport,
the Enkarans of today...

05:45.721 --> 05:48.473
..would have no concept
of where that planet is.

05:48.557 --> 05:53.020
I'll put SG-5, 6 and 9 out
looking for another suitable planet.

05:54.146 --> 05:57.107
It's doubtful they'll find one in time, sir.

05:58.734 --> 06:02.654
How long can we keep the Enkarans
here on Earth in the meantime?

06:02.738 --> 06:06.658
A matter of days. Their condition would
degrade the longer they were here.

06:06.783 --> 06:11.246
There are thousands of them outside
Hedrazar's village, spread a fair distance.

06:11.330 --> 06:16.210
It took us two weeks to transplant them
to P5S-381 in the first place.

06:17.669 --> 06:21.590
The point is, General,
we could never save them all.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.690
Hey. Whaddaya got?

06:38.774 --> 06:40.901
The atmosphere in the wake of the ship...

06:40.984 --> 06:44.571
..shows a high incidence
of sulphur dioxide.

06:44.696 --> 06:49.076
- Chemical warfare?
- I don't think so, sir. Take a look at this.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.333
Oh, yeah.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.545
Little... fuzzy orange things.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.172
- They're microbes, sir.
- Ah.

07:02.297 --> 07:05.467
The alien ship is depositing them
on the planet surface.

07:05.592 --> 07:09.429
As near as I can tell, they bond with
sulphur leeched out of the soil,...

07:09.555 --> 07:13.058
..and when they decay
they release sulphur dioxide.

07:13.809 --> 07:17.396
So the big, mean alien ship
is trying to stink up the planet?

07:17.521 --> 07:19.231
It's a bit more than that.

07:19.356 --> 07:23.986
The microbes are only deposited after
all native organisms have been destroyed.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.446
I think they're meant to replace them.

07:26.530 --> 07:31.952
If I'm correct, we're looking at the first
building blocks of an alien ecosystem.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.287
It's a terraformer?

07:33.370 --> 07:37.624
It's changing the environment to support
an entirely different kind of life.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.711
An organic system based
on sulphur instead of carbon.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.922
If it's allowed to continue,
the whole planet will be remade?

07:44.047 --> 07:47.885
All I know is that the atmosphere
on the other side of that energy curtain...

07:47.968 --> 07:51.054
..will not support life as we know it.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.702
- What's goin' on?
- They do not wish to leave, O'Neill.

08:30.344 --> 08:34.264
- Teal'c says you don't wanna go.
- If we go with you to Earth...

08:34.389 --> 08:38.936
..and you cannot find another world on
which we could live, we will die there.

08:39.061 --> 08:43.106
- Give us a chance.
- Is there time to take every Enkaran?

08:44.650 --> 08:46.068
No.

08:46.151 --> 08:50.614
- We cannot leave our people behind.
- Look, I understand how you feel...

08:50.697 --> 08:54.618
Generations ago our ancestors were
kidnapped from their home world...

08:54.701 --> 08:57.329
..and taken away in giant ships.

08:57.412 --> 09:02.292
Since then we have all prayed
for a place that we could call home.

09:02.376 --> 09:06.630
- Thanks to you, we have found it.
- We must stay here and fight for it.

09:06.713 --> 09:10.300
- With what?
- Have you not weapons to aid us?

09:12.886 --> 09:16.473
We're gonna try to communicate
with whoever's on that ship first.

09:16.557 --> 09:20.310
- Clearly they intend to destroy us.
- We don't know anything for sure.

09:20.435 --> 09:27.818
I know that if the Enkaran people are to
die, then we shall all die here, together.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.378
Transmitter's operational.
Let's hope we get a bite.

09:46.461 --> 09:49.882
Think a well-placed stinger
would do some damage?

09:49.965 --> 09:52.968
We have no way of knowing
what the ship's made of, sir.

09:53.051 --> 09:57.055
- Or if it possesses shield technology.
- Ah, just fantasising.

09:57.139 --> 10:01.435
Any intelligence capable of engineering
that thing has to be capable of reason.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.604
The question is, will they listen?

10:03.729 --> 10:06.607
No, the real question is
will they have ears?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.826
Somebody heard something.

10:26.001 --> 10:29.421
It appears to be a storage
facility of some kind.

10:31.089 --> 10:34.593
I'm going to assume
we're on board that ship.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.811
It's strange. The aliens
went to so much trouble...

10:44.895 --> 10:50.526
..to change the atmosphere of the planet,
yet the air in here is perfectly breathable.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.240
They were expecting us.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.792
- Carter?
- Sir?

11:06.875 --> 11:10.212
Should we really be opening
drawers and things?

11:14.591 --> 11:17.052
What did I just say?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.389
Sorry.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.697
Looks like some kind of tissue sample.

11:37.656 --> 11:40.617
- Of what?
- I'm not sure.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.579
Ship's terraforming the planet, right?

11:43.662 --> 11:47.082
What if these are the life forms
it's creating the environment for?

11:47.207 --> 11:51.044
- Recreating an entire civilisation.
- Millions of samples...

11:51.128 --> 11:56.800
So... every one of
these things is... a what?

11:56.884 --> 11:59.344
- Plant, animal, insect...
- Alien?

12:00.721 --> 12:04.057
- Who knows?
- It's still just a guess.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.643
(man) A good one.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.444
I am Lotan.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.531
You need not fear me.

12:21.533 --> 12:25.621
Yeah. Listen,
what's goin' on around here?

12:25.704 --> 12:29.041
I have been assembled in order
to facilitate communication...

12:29.124 --> 12:32.794
..between this "ship",
as you call it, and yourselves.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.547
Assembled?

12:35.631 --> 12:40.594
I am a biomechanical representation
of the beings now occupying this planet.

12:40.677 --> 12:44.014
When they were encountered,
several Enkarans were scanned.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.975
A randomised but similar
appearance was selected.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.520
Wait a second. That was yesterday.

12:49.603 --> 12:53.524
The ship analysed a new life form
and created a replicant in one day?

12:53.649 --> 12:55.692
Yes.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.238
Fascinating design.

12:59.321 --> 13:02.741
I suppose that explains
why you look like an Enkaran.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.327
Sort of.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.792
- You are not.
- No, we're from a planet called Earth.

13:11.917 --> 13:17.047
Major Samantha Carter. Daniel Jackson.
This is Jack O'Neill and this is Teal'c.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.470
Actually, we're friends of the people
your ship seems bent on wiping out.

13:23.554 --> 13:26.223
Yes, that is unfortunate.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.854
I was created to deliver
a message to them.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.398
However, by the time I was completed,

13:34.523 --> 13:37.067
the Enkarans seemed
to have disappeared.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.153
Yeah, see, that's called "running away".

13:40.279 --> 13:43.615
What one does
to avoid being slaughtered.

13:44.700 --> 13:48.537
There are still quite a few
Enkarans living on the planet.

13:49.413 --> 13:53.458
Since you are friends of the Enkarans,
would you deliver the message to them?

13:53.542 --> 13:55.419
That would depend.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.172
When the transformation
process was begun,...

13:58.255 --> 14:00.799
..there were no
sentient life forms present.

14:00.883 --> 14:04.386
- Yeah, well, there are now.
- Yes.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.931
Unfortunately, once the process
has begun, it must be completed.

14:08.015 --> 14:13.395
Someone went to the trouble of making
you, just to say "Tough luck, get out"?

14:16.023 --> 14:19.109
We wish no harm
to come to the Enkarans.

14:19.193 --> 14:22.613
However, examination of
their physiology has determined...

14:22.738 --> 14:25.991
..that they cannot exist
in the transformed environment.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.994
So stop transforming.

14:30.704 --> 14:36.960
- If I can just try and get the point across...
- I know what the point is. He's a PR guy.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.756
I think we should be talking to your boss.

14:41.924 --> 14:45.344
Assumption of hierarchal
command structure.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.846
Interesting.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.099
Follow me.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.034
The ship is fully automated.

15:12.079 --> 15:15.749
The beings that built it
are called the Gad-Meer.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.759
Not exactly ET.

15:27.511 --> 15:31.765
They placed all of their knowledge
within the ship's memory.

15:31.849 --> 15:35.352
Science, mathematics,
medicine, art, philosophy...

15:35.477 --> 15:38.814
Ten thousand years of civilisation.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.400
This is their legacy.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.655
They were a very advanced race
compared to the Enkarans.

15:46.738 --> 15:50.659
However, they were also... peaceful,...

15:51.952 --> 15:54.913
..and fell victim
to a superior military power.

15:54.997 --> 15:59.293
So they built this ship in the hopes
that their world would be born again,...

15:59.418 --> 16:01.879
..far from the reach of their enemies.

16:02.004 --> 16:07.342
This is, uh, this is fascinating.
I'd love a chance to study some of that.

16:07.426 --> 16:10.220
I can provide you with translations.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.807
Your language is simple by comparison.

16:13.891 --> 16:16.268
Excuse me.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.812
About why we're here?

16:20.230 --> 16:23.901
The ship has only enough raw material
to transform one planet.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.905
Now the transformation has been
started, it must be finished here,...

16:28.030 --> 16:32.743
..or the entire Gad-Meer civilisation
will be lost for ever.

16:32.868 --> 16:35.954
The Enkarans must leave or they will die.

16:37.039 --> 16:41.752
- Now, see, right there we got a problem.
- The Enkarans cannot leave.

16:41.877 --> 16:47.090
Their lives depend on the very rare
conditions that are unique to this planet.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.218
That is unfortunate.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.390
That's it?

16:55.474 --> 16:58.977
Please explain the situation
to the Enkarans.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.939
(Carter) But...

17:12.532 --> 17:14.576
They're back.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.289
Well? Did you speak with the aliens?

17:20.582 --> 17:22.792
In a way.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.420
It did not go well.

17:28.632 --> 17:31.343
No. It didn't.

17:43.355 --> 17:48.068
The tests on the alien microbes show that
they are also vulnerable to UV radiation.

17:48.193 --> 17:51.113
That's probably why
they chose this planet.

17:51.196 --> 17:55.200
- The dense ozone layer.
- Among other things, I'm sure.

17:55.284 --> 17:59.121
The same conditions that make
P5S-381 ideal for the Enkarans...

17:59.246 --> 18:02.416
..make it ideal for the transformation.

18:02.499 --> 18:06.003
Can this information be used
to stop the alien ship?

18:07.296 --> 18:09.756
I'm not sure how, sir.

18:09.882 --> 18:13.802
That's assuming we have
a right to stop them at all.

18:13.886 --> 18:17.222
- Excuse me?
- Not to be insensitive to the Enkarans,...

18:17.347 --> 18:21.268
..but we'd be interfering with
the rebirth of an entire civilisation.

18:21.351 --> 18:25.189
If you believe Lotan, an incredibly
advanced, civilised and peaceful one.

18:25.272 --> 18:30.402
- So the best society wins here?
- No, I wasn't saying that.

18:30.485 --> 18:35.199
We're talkin' about freeze-dried aliens
whose civilisation was lost long ago.

18:35.324 --> 18:38.994
- The Enkarans are there now.
- I don't want anything to happen to them.

18:39.077 --> 18:42.498
Could this robot be convinced
to delay the transformation...

18:42.623 --> 18:45.334
..long enough for us
to relocate the Enkarans?

18:45.417 --> 18:48.921
- Robot's a robot, sir.
- He's basically just a messenger, sir.

18:49.004 --> 18:54.927
But he was created in the image of the
Enkarans so that they could relate to him.

18:55.010 --> 18:58.013
- Now, that could work to our advantage.
- How?

18:58.138 --> 19:02.226
Well, it might make him
more sympathetic to their plight.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.770
It's a robot.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.148
He is an incredibly
advanced alien creation.

19:08.273 --> 19:12.444
We shouldn't just assume that
he's incapable of reason or feelings.

19:12.528 --> 19:15.697
Well, he didn't seem
very concerned with helping.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.409
If he's capable of learning, we might
get him outside his programming.

19:19.493 --> 19:22.746
What if he isn't and we can't?

19:22.830 --> 19:25.374
What do you propose, Colonel?

19:25.457 --> 19:28.627
I say we throw everything
we've got at that ship.

19:28.752 --> 19:33.632
I'm sorry. I can't authorise
a military strike in this situation, Colonel.

19:33.757 --> 19:39.513
Look, General, I apologise if this seems
to have taken on a personal edge for me.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.432
But we spent months
getting to know these people.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.893
They trusted us, and we screwed up.

19:45.018 --> 19:50.065
I understand your feeling.
We've all invested a lot in this operation.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.443
No one wants to see it
end up badly for the Enkarans.

19:53.569 --> 19:58.282
But you're not gonna give me
any effective weapons or personnel.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.076
Find another way out of this.

20:03.871 --> 20:06.331
Dismissed.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.810
The alien ship draws closer.

20:35.485 --> 20:38.488
Hedrazar, you can still save
the people of your village.

20:38.614 --> 20:43.410
Our resolve has not changed. We will
not abandon the rest of our people.

20:43.535 --> 20:46.705
Did General Hammond
not authorise troops and weapons?

20:46.788 --> 20:48.207
No, he didn't.

20:48.290 --> 20:51.793
You brought us here. We trusted you
when you told us it was safe.

20:51.877 --> 20:54.713
- I know.
- You gave us technology to build cities,...

20:54.796 --> 20:58.800
..to provide heat.
Have you not any way to stop the ship?

21:11.522 --> 21:14.608
- How much naqahdah is in that reactor?
- Sir?

21:14.733 --> 21:18.237
- What are you doing?
- Thinking. Don't worry about it too much.

21:18.362 --> 21:21.865
Of a way to blow up the ship? I'm not
sure that's what Hammond had in mind.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.910
They're gonna stand there and die.

21:26.870 --> 21:31.917
It's a no-win situation. We're not gonna sit
around and watch them get slaughtered.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.087
- You'd blow up that ship?
- Give me another choice.

21:35.170 --> 21:40.300
- Well, I don't have one at the moment...
- Apparently time is a factor here.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.560
How do you make a naqahdah bomb?

21:51.812 --> 21:55.649
Well, sir, the reactor was designed
to prevent exactly that kind...

21:55.732 --> 21:57.109
Carter.

22:00.737 --> 22:04.575
Theoretically,
if I created a feedback loop,...

22:04.658 --> 22:08.495
..the energy would build up
instead of being released.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.165
It would be a big explosion, sir.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.959
Big enough?

22:15.002 --> 22:17.045
I think so.

22:17.963 --> 22:23.719
Carter... I'm making a choice
to help these people.

22:23.802 --> 22:27.723
But if you don't make that bomb,
I'm out of options.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.351
I know.

22:31.476 --> 22:34.396
So I have to order you to do it.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.817
Yes, sir.

23:00.255 --> 23:04.551
- How controlled is this gonna be?
- The blast will be aimed upward.

23:04.635 --> 23:09.014
This ridge should protect the village,
but this is as close as I would put it.

23:09.097 --> 23:12.267
I've modified this remote
to start the feedback loop.

23:12.392 --> 23:16.688
About a minute after you press
the button, the reactor should blow.

23:16.813 --> 23:20.400
- Ship's ETA?
- About five-zero minutes, sir.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.945
But we should detonate
before it's overhead.

23:23.070 --> 23:27.157
There's no telling what
that energy beam will do to the reactor.

23:27.241 --> 23:29.952
- OK.
- There's one more thing, sir.

23:31.245 --> 23:34.122
Once you detonate the reactor,
there's no turning back.

23:34.206 --> 23:36.333
The overload can't be stopped.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.629
All right.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.230
Daniel Jackson?

24:01.316 --> 24:04.111
- You do not plan on staying?
- No, actually.

24:04.194 --> 24:07.447
I'm gonna go try to talk to Lotan.

24:07.531 --> 24:11.034
If you warn Lotan of our plan,
it will prove ineffectual.

24:11.118 --> 24:16.331
I won't give anything away. I just wanna
try to prevent it from being necessary.

24:17.166 --> 24:20.002
Should you not wait for
the return of Colonel O'Neill?

24:20.085 --> 24:26.091
He asked me to give him another choice,
so technically I'm following an order.

25:09.301 --> 25:12.012
- Hello, Daniel Jackson.
- Hi.

25:14.181 --> 25:17.184
Are the Enkarans
going to leave the planet?

25:19.019 --> 25:23.315
Actually, the Enkarans
have nowhere else to go.

25:24.858 --> 25:28.278
That is... tough luck.

25:30.322 --> 25:34.076
While you were gone, I breathed some
of the sulphur-based environment...

25:34.201 --> 25:37.454
..being created by the ship.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.290
- How is it?
- Not good.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.296
(discordant noise)

25:46.380 --> 25:50.759
This music has not been heard
in over a thousand years.

25:53.637 --> 25:57.057
- It's nice.
- It sounds very unpleasant to me.

25:57.850 --> 25:59.893
Really?

26:01.061 --> 26:04.898
- Yes. This is not how it should sound.
- (noise stops)

26:08.485 --> 26:13.282
- How so?
- It seems the design of your ears,...

26:13.365 --> 26:16.201
..my ears, is not meant for it.

26:17.578 --> 26:19.621
Um...

26:22.457 --> 26:27.504
To be honest with you, I'm here to see
if you'll consider alternate solutions...

26:27.588 --> 26:30.507
..to the problem faced by the Enkarans.

26:30.883 --> 26:35.053
I am not programmed to solve
the problem faced by the Enkarans.

26:35.137 --> 26:37.181
Right.

26:39.308 --> 26:45.063
Let me ask you something. What will
happen to you when this is all over?

26:45.147 --> 26:48.650
I will be reintegrated
into the ship's systems.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.986
You mean you'll die?

26:51.069 --> 26:54.239
Yes, I suppose that is one interpretation.

26:55.657 --> 27:00.954
- Do you wanna die?
- What I want is irrelevant.

27:01.038 --> 27:02.998
Wouldn't you like to experience...

27:03.123 --> 27:07.503
..what it's like to be an Enkaran
before you're reintegrated?

27:07.586 --> 27:11.173
See some of the planet before
it's completely transformed, and...

27:11.256 --> 27:14.843
- ..maybe even meet the people?
- For what purpose?

27:14.927 --> 27:18.180
It might help you consider
alternate solutions.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.100
I'm not programmed
for alternate solutions.

27:22.184 --> 27:25.187
The ship will continue the process
without you, correct?

27:25.270 --> 27:28.440
Yes. As I have said,
its function is fully automated.

27:28.565 --> 27:33.987
Well, there. Then no harm done.
We'll just... we'll have a look around.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.513
Sir, no disrespect intended,...

27:59.596 --> 28:03.183
..but I have doubts as to whether
or not we're doing the right thing.

28:03.267 --> 28:06.770
What is that, Carter? The right thing?

28:06.854 --> 28:09.940
We brought these people here.
They depend on us.

28:10.023 --> 28:13.360
- What else are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

28:13.443 --> 28:16.446
- Do you wanna talk me outta this?
- Yes, sir.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.791
- Stay in contact.
- Yes, sir.

28:43.682 --> 28:47.603
The air is not as pure
as that created for me on the ship.

28:47.686 --> 28:50.689
It's definitely... different.

28:53.609 --> 28:56.695
- This is better.
- I agree.

29:02.701 --> 29:04.995
These are trees.

29:06.121 --> 29:08.081
Yes.

29:08.165 --> 29:12.294
Anywhere there's oxygen
you're sure to find... trees.

29:12.377 --> 29:16.840
They're... kind of like nature's air filters.

29:20.010 --> 29:24.640
- Their design is most interesting.
- So is their function.

29:32.773 --> 29:36.360
Daniel Jackson has gone
to speak with Lotan.

29:36.443 --> 29:40.030
- Did you try to stop him?
- I do not disagree with his intentions.

29:40.155 --> 29:42.991
You do know we're gonna
try and blow up that ship?

29:43.075 --> 29:46.078
I am aware of that. As is Daniel Jackson.

29:48.455 --> 29:50.916
Daniel?

29:50.999 --> 29:53.794
- Daniel, come in.
- I read you, Jack.

29:53.877 --> 29:56.630
Tell me, tell me you're not on that ship!

29:58.674 --> 30:00.551
OK, I'm not on the ship.

30:03.303 --> 30:06.807
- What are you doin', Daniel?
- I'm talking to Lotan.

30:08.934 --> 30:13.647
- Is he gonna tell him about the bomb?
- He said he would not reveal our plan.

30:14.022 --> 30:16.149
Sir, we only have 15 minutes.

30:18.527 --> 30:21.405
Daniel, do you know what time it is?

30:21.488 --> 30:24.658
I am trying to give you another choice.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.535
What?

30:26.618 --> 30:30.539
Hang on. We're on our way back
to the village. Over and out.

30:34.251 --> 30:37.004
You have disobeyed your superior.

30:38.463 --> 30:41.425
No, not... exactly.

30:42.676 --> 30:46.263
- You are not fulfilling your function.
- That's not true.

30:46.346 --> 30:52.186
I'm just... I'm choosing the best way
to fulfil my true function.

30:52.269 --> 30:58.025
Hierarchal command structures don't
allow you to consider all of the options.

30:59.026 --> 31:01.320
I see.

31:01.445 --> 31:04.448
Let's, um... Iet's go to the village.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.251
Daniel?

31:16.376 --> 31:19.046
Lotan wanted to meet the Enkarans.

31:21.256 --> 31:23.550
(Carter) Ten minutes, sir.

31:27.054 --> 31:29.097
Hello, Dr Jackson.

31:29.723 --> 31:31.600
Hello, Eliam.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.769
This is Lotan.

31:36.730 --> 31:40.234
He looks Enkaran.
But I have not met him before.

31:42.528 --> 31:46.114
Lotan is a representative
of the aliens who built the ship.

31:46.198 --> 31:51.245
He was created in your image in order to
better communicate the danger you're in.

31:51.370 --> 31:55.123
- Yet he does not stop it.
- No.

31:55.207 --> 31:57.918
Lotan, this is Eliam.

32:00.003 --> 32:04.716
This is his wife Nikka, and this
is Hedrazar, the leader of the village.

32:10.514 --> 32:13.475
Are you able to see the lives
that will be extinguished...

32:13.559 --> 32:16.311
..if your ship continues its current path?

32:16.395 --> 32:18.856
Yes, Lotan is aware of that.

32:21.149 --> 32:24.236
She is without sight.

32:25.737 --> 32:30.200
It was happening to them on the planet
when we first met. They were dying.

32:30.284 --> 32:33.954
This is the only planet we could find
where we knew they could survive.

32:34.079 --> 32:38.375
- I am aware of their physiological needs.
- Yes, of course.

32:40.961 --> 32:43.088
That one is going to give birth.

32:43.172 --> 32:45.299
Yes. To a new Enkaran life.

32:45.424 --> 32:49.178
There will be no Enkaran life at all
if your ship does not stop.

32:49.261 --> 32:52.055
I think we're all aware of the situation.

32:52.139 --> 32:56.685
Yes. You have brought me here
to elicit sympathy for these people.

32:56.768 --> 33:00.272
Well, actually they're
your people in a way, Lotan.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.691
You were created in their image.

33:02.774 --> 33:05.944
I was not created to prevent
their demise, Daniel Jackson.

33:06.069 --> 33:11.116
- But... don't you wish you could?
- The ship calls me back.

33:11.241 --> 33:13.368
- Why?
- I must go.

33:13.452 --> 33:16.371
- Take me with you.
- No. Daniel, no!

33:20.459 --> 33:24.463
- Five minutes, sir.
- Lotan took Daniel back onto the ship.

33:24.546 --> 33:27.799
- What?! Sir...
- He asked to go.

33:27.925 --> 33:31.970
Well, what are we gonna do, sir?
The ship is almost in position.

33:38.769 --> 33:42.439
The ship has detected an unusual device.

33:42.564 --> 33:46.860
It appears to be capable
of emitting great amounts of energy.

33:50.155 --> 33:56.328
Is this device intended to try and stop the
ship, as the Enkaran Eliam suggested?

33:56.411 --> 33:59.164
Look, I don't agree
with what they're doing,...

33:59.248 --> 34:02.918
..but I also don't wanna see you
wipe out those people.

34:03.001 --> 34:06.505
If they will not leave,
there is no other option.

34:08.841 --> 34:11.301
Ship is in position, sir.

34:24.606 --> 34:27.568
If you're gonna do it,
you have to do it now.

34:32.072 --> 34:35.742
Daniel Jackson
has made his choice, O'Neill.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.965
Yeah.

35:06.106 --> 35:09.026
The device has entered an active state.

35:10.068 --> 35:13.739
Lotan, if you wanted to,
can you stop the ship?

35:15.324 --> 35:18.243
- As I have said...
- Yes, it's not about what you want.

35:18.327 --> 35:22.789
Please, just answer the question.
Can you stop the ship?

35:22.915 --> 35:27.961
- It would be possible, yes.
- OK. Then think about this.

35:28.086 --> 35:33.467
Think about the people down there and
all the life that you will be destroying.

35:33.550 --> 35:36.887
I am programmed to serve
the life on this ship.

35:44.645 --> 35:48.815
You say that they were an advanced
civilisation, 10,000 years of history?

35:48.899 --> 35:50.442
Yes.

35:50.526 --> 35:53.278
- They had laws, justice?
- Yes.

35:53.362 --> 35:55.405
- A respect for life?
- Yes.

35:55.489 --> 36:00.369
Then how can their world be re-created
through an act of mass murder?

36:01.745 --> 36:05.791
Wouldn't that be a betrayal
of everything they stood for?

36:06.917 --> 36:09.795
You said you were made to communicate.

36:11.338 --> 36:13.549
You're not here to serve life on this ship.

36:13.674 --> 36:17.427
You're here to protect
the integrity of life on this ship.

36:18.136 --> 36:20.597
There's a big difference.

36:22.140 --> 36:27.354
Are you really fulfilling your true
function by allowing this to happen?

36:38.198 --> 36:40.909
60 seconds to detonation.

36:47.332 --> 36:49.793
The ship has stopped, O'Neill.

36:54.006 --> 36:56.758
(whispers) The ship has stopped.

36:57.301 --> 37:00.220
Daniel must've gotten through to him.

37:02.514 --> 37:06.977
Daniel, if you can hear me,
you've got 30 seconds.

37:07.102 --> 37:10.022
Three zero. Over.

37:10.105 --> 37:13.025
Um, about that device...

37:14.526 --> 37:18.697
- It is still active.
- Yes. Can you do anything about that?

37:25.454 --> 37:28.081
- Do you know how to deactivate it?
- No.

37:29.082 --> 37:31.460
- Intriguing design.
- Uh, yeah.

37:31.585 --> 37:37.132
- Lotan, we really don't have time for this.
- How much time do we have?

37:37.591 --> 37:40.427
Five, four, three,...

37:41.136 --> 37:43.597
..two, one.

37:54.024 --> 37:57.861
- What is going on?
- The ship remains.

38:06.119 --> 38:08.247
A powerful explosive.

38:08.372 --> 38:11.208
We were desperate.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.836
The conflict remains unresolved.

38:13.919 --> 38:17.923
I must eventually resume the
transformation process on this planet,...

38:18.006 --> 38:22.469
- ..or the Gad-Meer civilisation will be lost.
- I know.

38:27.474 --> 38:31.228
Many millions of planets were scanned...

38:31.353 --> 38:35.607
..to match the right conditions
for the transformation.

38:36.817 --> 38:39.736
Only one met the specifications.

38:41.822 --> 38:45.742
Just out of curiosity,
were any others even close?

38:45.868 --> 38:49.705
2,634 parameters had to be
exactly right in order for...

38:49.788 --> 38:54.168
For the transformation process.
Yes, but what about for the Enkarans?

38:54.251 --> 38:56.295
I do not understand.

38:56.378 --> 38:59.256
Maybe they don't need
exactly the same environment...

38:59.339 --> 39:02.217
..as the transformation process,
just a similar one.

39:02.301 --> 39:07.973
You know their physiology. Do any of
the planets scanned match their needs?

39:14.771 --> 39:16.815
Here.

39:20.068 --> 39:23.906
This planet would be
appropriate for the Enkarans.

39:29.828 --> 39:34.958
I regret that I did not consider
this possibility, Daniel Jackson.

39:35.083 --> 39:38.337
Well, you would've
gotten there eventually.

39:39.463 --> 39:44.176
This planet was rejected because three
of the parameters were not correct.

39:44.301 --> 39:48.472
The core temperature was too warm,
the size was too large,...

39:49.306 --> 39:53.602
..and there were intelligent
life forms already present.

39:53.727 --> 39:55.854
Intelligent life forms?

39:58.857 --> 40:02.778
Based on the description,
I believe they were Enkaran.

40:15.332 --> 40:18.001
So, what shall we do now?

40:20.420 --> 40:22.881
- What is it?
- It's OK.

40:22.965 --> 40:25.425
Don't, uh... don't be afraid.

40:33.058 --> 40:35.185
What's goin' on?

40:35.269 --> 40:38.355
Lotan would like
to offer you a compromise.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.483
The ship has expended too many
of the resources needed...

40:41.567 --> 40:45.320
..for the transformation process
to begin again on another planet.

40:45.445 --> 40:47.990
I require that you give up this world.

40:50.742 --> 40:53.495
How is that a compromise?

40:53.579 --> 40:56.999
We found the original
Enkaran home world.

41:00.878 --> 41:02.421
- What?
- How?

41:02.504 --> 41:06.967
It was one of several million planets
scanned by the ship before this one.

41:07.092 --> 41:12.598
It was rejected partly because of
the presence of intelligent life forms.

41:12.681 --> 41:16.435
- He's telling us this now?
- Well, he didn't know.

41:16.560 --> 41:21.356
And technically he's just a day
and a half old, so give him a break.

41:22.941 --> 41:27.488
We will gladly accept this offer
to return to the home of our ancestors.

41:28.655 --> 41:32.493
- How do we get them there?
- Their home world has no Stargate.

41:36.413 --> 41:41.752
Well, actually I have this friend with a big
spaceship who's willing to take them.

41:44.171 --> 41:47.591
- Is this possible?
- Yes.

41:47.716 --> 41:51.762
Once you are safely to your home planet,
I will be reintegrated into the ship,...

41:51.845 --> 41:55.098
..and the ship will return
to complete the transformation.

41:55.182 --> 42:01.104
Does that have to happen? The part
about you being reintegrated?

42:03.315 --> 42:06.985
- What other option is there?
- But you are Enkaran.

42:07.069 --> 42:09.696
You must stay with us.

42:13.116 --> 42:16.620
That is not contrary to my programming.

42:20.707 --> 42:25.337
Lotan says thank you,
he'd like that very much.

42:28.674 --> 42:33.804
Spread the word among the villages.
We are going home!
