WEBVTT

00:01.607 --> 00:03.064
It's your brother's address.

00:03.184 --> 00:04.954
I can't just leave her.

00:07.117 --> 00:08.436
The Cold War,

00:08.469 --> 00:10.679
the guys with their
fingers on the button...

00:10.712 --> 00:12.534
they all had bunkers.

00:12.556 --> 00:14.568
We can keep 15 people alive.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.857
- For up to a century.
- We call it Mount Genesis.

00:17.910 --> 00:19.690
Did you just...

00:19.745 --> 00:21.293
put on the aftershave?

00:22.185 --> 00:23.071
Shush.

00:23.082 --> 00:24.850
When the TV says that my wife

00:24.877 --> 00:26.781
has been hunted down like a dog...

00:26.901 --> 00:30.097
There are seven billion
people on this planet,

00:30.130 --> 00:32.225
and we've got this guy's nephew.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:47.558 --> 00:48.835
See that?

00:48.955 --> 00:51.225
That's what's gonna kill everyone.

00:52.134 --> 00:53.955
Any second now...

00:54.673 --> 00:56.620
It doesn't matter who you are,

00:56.740 --> 00:59.289
who you pray to, Black or White,

00:59.300 --> 01:01.882
straight or gay, rich or poor.

01:05.187 --> 01:09.220
Yeah, it's Judgement Day,
the actual apocalypse.

01:09.242 --> 01:11.823
And where am I? In Slough.

01:11.982 --> 01:14.412
Or rather, under Slough,

01:14.614 --> 01:16.015
watching it on telly.

01:16.037 --> 01:18.172
One minute now. One minute.

01:18.209 --> 01:20.907
These pictures coming
live to us from Hubble.

01:20.923 --> 01:22.526
You know that valley in Africa

01:22.537 --> 01:25.196
that all human DNA can be traced back to?

01:25.249 --> 01:28.528
Well, centuries from
now, will archaeologists

01:28.555 --> 01:30.355
say the same thing about Slough?

01:30.547 --> 01:34.410
- Get me out of here!
- I mean, are we the future of mankind?

01:34.443 --> 01:36.472
It's time to brace ourselves

01:36.592 --> 01:38.239
to say goodbye.

01:38.513 --> 01:40.274
I hope we'll meet again.

01:45.161 --> 01:46.440
- _
- It's a work in progress,

01:46.500 --> 01:49.373
but we have every faith
in a positive outcome.

01:49.770 --> 01:54.018
Operation Saviour continues to
advance at an astounding pace,

01:54.138 --> 01:56.266
a testament to what can be achieved

01:56.277 --> 01:58.914
through shared international endeavour.

01:59.468 --> 02:00.599
Ten days from now,

02:00.610 --> 02:02.640
the Saviour spacecraft
will be rocket-launched

02:02.657 --> 02:04.380
beyond the Earth's atmosphere...

02:06.256 --> 02:08.434
I have what you want.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.237
You have what I want.

02:10.716 --> 02:12.844
Let's do something about that.

02:13.347 --> 02:14.758
Once in place,

02:14.803 --> 02:17.898
Team Saviour will be
able to pinpoint precisely

02:18.075 --> 02:21.036
- the best moment to deploy the craft's nuclear warhead,
- _

02:21.057 --> 02:24.246
pushing the comet off its
collision course with Earth.

02:24.289 --> 02:26.836
_

02:28.704 --> 02:31.342
- _
- Lord, forgive me.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.596
Last night I had a dream.

02:34.081 --> 02:36.618
An inappropriate dream about Father Jude.

02:36.962 --> 02:39.223
I know I must fight these thoughts.

02:39.343 --> 02:41.943
Strive to be pure of thought and deed.

02:43.191 --> 02:45.478
But it is difficult, Lord,

02:45.550 --> 02:47.283
for I am scared of dying.

02:47.487 --> 02:50.555
The rest of the world can take
comfort in each other's arms,

02:50.608 --> 02:52.455
but I have no-one.

02:53.035 --> 02:56.512
Oh, for Heaven's sake, no
need to rub my nose in it.

02:58.114 --> 03:01.220
I had to give half our
caseload to Father Christophe.

03:02.034 --> 03:05.339
Don't worry. I cherry-picked
the best ones for us.

03:05.563 --> 03:07.307
We have a faith healer.

03:07.599 --> 03:09.150
Antonia Volenski.

03:09.270 --> 03:12.594
She's got half of Naples convinced
that she's a miracle worker.

03:12.714 --> 03:13.826
What?

03:14.203 --> 03:15.893
Why the face when I say Naples?

03:16.520 --> 03:18.216
It's not face. I...

03:18.237 --> 03:21.369
just I think we have more
pressing candidates to investigate.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.320
Huh...

03:22.487 --> 03:23.520
Celine,

03:23.907 --> 03:26.183
did you just bear false
witness in the house of God?

03:26.193 --> 03:27.555
Why don't you want to go to Naples?

03:28.532 --> 03:29.962
Are you in the Mafia?

03:31.126 --> 03:32.729
Witness Protection Programme?

03:32.849 --> 03:34.707
I know, you were a princess,

03:34.749 --> 03:38.199
and you went there desperately trying to
experience the life of a common person.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.402
That is the plot of Roman Holiday.

03:40.408 --> 03:42.114
So it is Witness Protection?

03:43.716 --> 03:45.908
I will book our transport for the morning.

03:46.682 --> 03:49.820
Celine, secrecy becomes you.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.441
Whooo!

03:58.442 --> 04:00.775
_

04:00.833 --> 04:02.451
Oh, man!

04:02.649 --> 04:06.658
I'm going to get me a big
juicy steak and cook it!

04:06.732 --> 04:09.764
And a chocolate milkshake! Ice-cold!

04:11.264 --> 04:12.688
Or a bourbon!

04:13.111 --> 04:14.098
- Yeah!
- Straight up!

04:14.134 --> 04:16.024
Straight up. And sex.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.531
By God, all-American fucking!

04:20.036 --> 04:21.558
I miss sex.

04:22.710 --> 04:25.508
Well, it's not going to be long now, girl.

04:25.524 --> 04:27.201
No, it's not!

04:32.327 --> 04:34.242
We barely know anything about her.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.884
We know she snores.

04:37.004 --> 04:39.577
I just want to know
why Ariel was important,

04:39.603 --> 04:42.005
and I... wasn't.

04:45.086 --> 04:46.431
Hello.

04:47.192 --> 04:48.973
Are you a bit more awake this time?

04:48.984 --> 04:50.367
Do you remember who we are?

04:51.364 --> 04:53.154
You're Jamie.

04:53.869 --> 04:55.310
And this is...

04:55.702 --> 04:57.033
Dave.

04:57.153 --> 05:00.384
And we're driving to London to find Ariel,

05:00.415 --> 05:03.719
and it's taking forever
because of the end of the world

05:03.725 --> 05:05.442
and the ridiculous bloody traffic.

05:07.143 --> 05:09.398
Top marks. Word for word.

05:09.957 --> 05:11.833
Mind like a steel trap, me.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.765
Crisps, Coke, taser?

05:15.052 --> 05:17.579
- Did you say tasers?
- We're fine, thanks.

05:17.611 --> 05:20.210
Depends, innit? Won't be long
now, there won't be no laws.

05:20.219 --> 05:21.850
No please and thank you.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.353
You all right for bread? Taser.

05:23.384 --> 05:25.587
You want to keep them shoes? Taser.

05:28.326 --> 05:31.773
No need for tasers now you've got me.

05:32.437 --> 05:34.932
I once took down a cop
with his own truncheon.

05:34.947 --> 05:36.524
Are you serious?

05:36.571 --> 05:38.925
Yeah, nuclear disarmament rally, '81.

05:39.468 --> 05:40.936
He never saw it coming.

05:40.972 --> 05:43.812
Jamie, your vagina mum is awesome.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.036
_

05:48.891 --> 05:51.078
_

05:51.469 --> 05:54.231
_

05:54.283 --> 05:56.836
_

05:57.494 --> 05:59.008
_

05:59.128 --> 06:00.798
_

06:01.153 --> 06:03.638
_

06:03.680 --> 06:05.548
_

06:05.976 --> 06:07.521
No, never.

06:07.871 --> 06:09.302
How would she collect the money?

06:09.735 --> 06:12.481
The donations? Soldi. Dinero.

06:12.861 --> 06:14.876
_

06:15.178 --> 06:16.953
_

06:17.166 --> 06:19.510
_

06:20.293 --> 06:21.619
_

06:21.639 --> 06:24.563
_

06:24.839 --> 06:26.113
I don't get it.

06:27.093 --> 06:30.215
- What's her angle?
- Maybe there is no angle.

06:31.786 --> 06:33.196
Ciao!

06:35.822 --> 06:37.082
Hey, boy.

06:37.722 --> 06:39.637
I heard you're looking for me.

06:39.862 --> 06:41.136
You're not welcome.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.471
Unless you're here to
reopen the soup kitchen.

06:44.649 --> 06:46.074
It's time you moved on.

06:46.252 --> 06:48.819
Antonia, I am Sister Celine.

06:48.846 --> 06:50.198
This is Father Jude.

06:50.213 --> 06:51.675
May I call you Antonia?

06:52.473 --> 06:55.470
You make people nervous,
poking around in that...

06:55.590 --> 06:56.566
get-up.

06:56.775 --> 06:59.934
Are these the same people
that say you do miracles?

07:09.722 --> 07:11.601
Sorry for the hold-up, boys.

07:12.451 --> 07:14.550
I reckon it's the drugs they've had me on.

07:14.988 --> 07:16.502
Waterworks on the blink.

07:20.453 --> 07:22.310
Maybe we should make some noise.

07:23.476 --> 07:24.964
Noise always helps me.

07:24.969 --> 07:26.960
- We could sing.
- Maybe I should...

07:27.079 --> 07:28.706
watch the van?

07:28.879 --> 07:29.808
Yeah...

07:30.487 --> 07:32.329
Can't be too careful.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.858
Jamie?

07:40.565 --> 07:41.828
Yes, Mary?

07:42.809 --> 07:45.007
Don't suppose you could tell me a story?

07:45.438 --> 07:46.756
About you.

07:47.262 --> 07:49.078
There's so much I don't know.

07:49.845 --> 07:50.727
Yeah,

07:51.083 --> 07:52.752
sure. I can do that.

07:54.470 --> 07:56.114
What do you want to know about?

07:56.280 --> 07:58.188
Anything.

07:58.892 --> 08:00.453
How did you meet Layla?

08:01.491 --> 08:04.811
She must be a gem, you going
to all this trouble to find her.

08:06.121 --> 08:07.806
She is actually, yeah.

08:09.556 --> 08:12.866
It's quite a funny story how we met.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.437
Lift broke down.

08:16.164 --> 08:18.038
Lights went out, and

08:18.743 --> 08:20.580
we were the only two people in there.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.798
We were stuck in there for three hours.

08:23.645 --> 08:25.888
Even in the dark I could tell she was...

08:26.318 --> 08:27.727
amazing,

08:27.847 --> 08:30.056
out of my league. But...

08:31.492 --> 08:33.355
I don't know. Something just...

08:33.679 --> 08:34.727
clicked.

08:48.321 --> 08:51.129
Whoo-hoo!

08:55.373 --> 08:56.787
It's um...

08:56.907 --> 09:00.645
- very secure.
- Butt-ugly. You can say it.

09:00.765 --> 09:04.221
Them damn cameras are so fake
even a hillbilly could see that.

09:04.341 --> 09:06.539
No waiting, no loitering!

09:07.902 --> 09:11.755
Oh, now, Junior, do I look
like a loiterer to you?

09:12.365 --> 09:13.700
Mama,

09:14.073 --> 09:15.153
is that you?

09:16.182 --> 09:17.926
Jolene,

09:18.103 --> 09:19.732
my baby girl!

09:20.374 --> 09:22.231
You're all grown!

09:22.351 --> 09:24.163
Mama's home!

09:32.409 --> 09:33.672
Come in.

09:34.230 --> 09:36.067
I spoke to Housekeeping.

09:36.099 --> 09:38.192
They gave me a list of
bars where Antonia go.

09:38.234 --> 09:40.483
Good, good. Well, she likes to drink.

09:40.510 --> 09:42.096
Maybe this is a Messiah that I can...

09:43.610 --> 09:46.126
She does not like religious formality,

09:46.246 --> 09:48.976
so I thought we could go inconspicuous.

09:49.347 --> 09:50.714
Is OK?

09:52.123 --> 09:53.684
Yes, um...

09:54.472 --> 09:56.044
You look...

09:56.312 --> 09:57.887
inconspicuous.

09:58.007 --> 10:00.247
So I see you outside in a minute?

10:01.321 --> 10:02.846
Yeah, I'll see you in a minute.

10:21.262 --> 10:24.436
Oh, my babies, my little babies!

10:24.472 --> 10:27.526
I'm home. Oh, boy...

10:27.547 --> 10:29.034
Howdy.

10:29.327 --> 10:30.882
Lookee here.

10:31.148 --> 10:33.001
If it isn't Big Todd.

10:33.038 --> 10:35.163
Hey, there, darling. Remember me?

10:35.601 --> 10:37.825
Rhonda, this is Todd Senior.

10:38.211 --> 10:41.025
Best kisser I ever met, so I married him.

10:41.656 --> 10:43.128
Todd, this is Rhonda.

10:43.190 --> 10:45.190
She's the one who got me out.

10:45.257 --> 10:46.568
She's peach.

10:46.636 --> 10:48.343
Very pleased to meet you.

10:48.693 --> 10:50.692
You got out near two weeks back.

10:50.812 --> 10:52.299
I seen it on the news.

10:52.367 --> 10:55.666
Well, now, baby, you
know just as well as I do,

10:55.729 --> 10:58.647
it's a long road when you're laying low.

10:58.919 --> 11:03.069
If it helps any, I thought about that
nice tight butt of yours the whole way.

11:07.672 --> 11:09.343
What's the matter, Poppa?

11:09.854 --> 11:12.471
You ain't gonna welcome
your girl proper like?

11:12.532 --> 11:15.982
Or you been so busy stocking
up on all this survivalist crap

11:16.008 --> 11:17.606
that you forgot how?!

11:21.301 --> 11:22.460
Mm!

11:26.134 --> 11:28.379
They had me worried for a second.

11:31.861 --> 11:33.396
Um...

11:34.346 --> 11:36.830
- Leanne?
- Take a load off.

11:37.013 --> 11:39.780
- Rhonda McNeil.
- Leanne?

11:43.027 --> 11:46.613
You put those things down. That's company!

11:49.066 --> 11:52.757
I'm serious now, kids. You put
those things down, and get it.

11:55.789 --> 11:57.272
Big Todd...

11:58.138 --> 11:59.501
What the fuck?

11:59.621 --> 12:01.353
Tell your friend to sit.

12:01.594 --> 12:04.773
- Maybe I should just go.
- Tell your friend the reward on her head

12:04.789 --> 12:06.521
didn't say nothing about
her being in good health.

12:06.522 --> 12:08.549
You stay right where you are, Rhonda.

12:08.668 --> 12:10.421
What the hell's got into you?

12:10.437 --> 12:13.361
Times are what they are,
and we could use the 200K.

12:13.408 --> 12:16.748
This woman got the mother
of your children out of jail!

12:16.800 --> 12:18.525
Think she's your friend, huh?

12:18.723 --> 12:20.731
- Think she's one of us?
- God

12:20.909 --> 12:24.928
damn it, Big Todd, did I call
her a fucking peach or did I not?!

12:24.963 --> 12:26.871
Tell you about her husband, then, did she?

12:26.990 --> 12:29.135
What?! Of course she told me...

12:31.163 --> 12:32.653
What about her husband?

12:32.773 --> 12:34.626
You ain't seen a picture?

12:35.456 --> 12:37.005
You ain't heard his name?

12:38.087 --> 12:39.827
Rajesh.

12:45.296 --> 12:47.368
What are they talking about, Rhonda?

12:52.307 --> 12:55.715
Uh, I think this must be the place.

13:09.495 --> 13:14.225
_

13:14.283 --> 13:16.037
Just a water for me, please.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.656
I'm surprised to see you here.

13:19.241 --> 13:22.039
You're here to check
I'm not some crazy woman

13:22.060 --> 13:24.853
claiming to be holy, so relax.

13:24.973 --> 13:27.880
I'm not holy. I never said I was.

13:28.601 --> 13:30.824
You're going to join me, won't you, Sister?

13:32.400 --> 13:33.804
If I do,

13:34.086 --> 13:37.155
you will talk to us, answer our questions?

13:37.213 --> 13:38.250
Sure.

13:38.491 --> 13:40.078
If you answer mine.

13:54.851 --> 13:56.428
- Scotty?
- In here.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.342
I know about Mount Genesis.

14:02.864 --> 14:04.790
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

14:04.827 --> 14:07.828
After all, if I tell the
world about our little bunker,

14:07.885 --> 14:10.391
it wouldn't be exclusive
any more, would it?

14:11.320 --> 14:14.504
So you're going to meet me tonight.

14:14.823 --> 14:16.154
Bring proof

14:16.274 --> 14:18.008
of the bunker's location.

14:18.342 --> 14:19.861
And the keys.

14:19.861 --> 14:21.427
Both the keys.

14:22.852 --> 14:24.438
Come alone.

14:24.804 --> 14:27.220
Or I kill the kid.

14:48.672 --> 14:51.945
If he knows about the
keys, we're being bugged.

14:52.216 --> 14:54.011
You didn't say anything about the bunker.

14:54.022 --> 14:56.783
- You said he had Spike.
- We have to go and meet him, right?

14:56.903 --> 14:59.387
- We don't have a choice.
- You have to leave this to me.

14:59.450 --> 15:03.314
- You stay on Genesis.
- This is Spike, OK

15:03.329 --> 15:04.478
- He's family!
- Scotty,

15:04.483 --> 15:07.886
you have 22 days to do four months' work!

15:09.176 --> 15:11.211
Strategy, staying cool,

15:11.253 --> 15:14.056
scaring the crap out of
people... that's what I do best,

15:14.098 --> 15:16.567
so I'm going to find out
everything I can about this guy,

15:16.625 --> 15:19.626
and I'm going to take care of it, OK?

15:22.706 --> 15:24.700
You're avoiding the question.

15:24.768 --> 15:28.108
You do realise that
you're flirting with a nun?

15:28.228 --> 15:29.763
That's a question.

15:29.768 --> 15:32.694
Only Celine gets to ask
questions, and it's not her turn.

15:32.696 --> 15:35.322
Celine, why are you a nun?

15:36.423 --> 15:39.742
OK, OK. My mother was a...

15:40.635 --> 15:42.618
She went out to work one night,

15:43.667 --> 15:45.969
and when I woke up in the morning,

15:46.178 --> 15:47.640
I was still alone.

15:48.203 --> 15:49.503
I was

15:49.623 --> 15:51.773
scared of the police, so I ran.

15:53.073 --> 15:54.780
Begging, stealing...

15:55.531 --> 15:57.274
trying to stay hidden.

15:59.936 --> 16:01.758
You lived on the streets?

16:03.068 --> 16:04.242
Of Naples?

16:05.114 --> 16:07.787
Eventually, the sisters found me.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.861
- They gave me a home.
- But your file...

16:11.143 --> 16:12.923
You never said...

16:12.927 --> 16:16.164
You were so rude that first day.

16:16.284 --> 16:17.787
You took one look,

16:17.850 --> 16:20.554
and decided you knew everything about me.

16:24.401 --> 16:27.183
In retrospect, that does seem like

16:27.465 --> 16:29.187
a dip move.

16:29.579 --> 16:31.072
I thought so.

16:33.028 --> 16:35.064
Maybe we are done

16:35.126 --> 16:37.669
making assumptions about each other, yes?

16:41.437 --> 16:42.878
Tell me...

16:43.688 --> 16:47.498
what are your plans for
the last weeks on Earth?

16:49.889 --> 16:51.429
In all likelihood,

16:51.549 --> 16:54.311
you're going to die in 22 days.

16:54.906 --> 16:57.427
I'm going to die, him, her...

16:57.871 --> 17:00.043
Those three on the sofa who

17:00.100 --> 17:02.381
I'm pretty sure are having sex.

17:06.755 --> 17:10.116
The Pope himself is
going to die in 22 days.

17:10.409 --> 17:13.468
And you're saying you can't think of one

17:13.515 --> 17:16.547
thing you want to do before death?

17:20.025 --> 17:21.977
_

17:24.811 --> 17:26.231
Is this it?

17:27.171 --> 17:28.680
Is this where Ariel is?

17:29.557 --> 17:30.768
Ready?

17:31.138 --> 17:32.563
Of course he's ready.

17:32.683 --> 17:35.148
Look at him. He's ready for anything.

17:43.327 --> 17:44.774
Ready...

17:49.252 --> 17:51.992
_

17:52.661 --> 17:54.483
Sorry, Jamie.

17:55.099 --> 17:56.425
Don't be sorry.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.414
We'll find another way in.

17:58.727 --> 18:01.399
There'll be clues. We'll
work out where he's got to.

18:01.926 --> 18:03.607
Not a problem, boys.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.236
You leave this to Mary.

18:05.957 --> 18:07.533
Oh... Yeah, great.

18:07.810 --> 18:10.613
Breaking and entering worked
out great last time, didn't it?

18:13.771 --> 18:15.297
What did she say, anyway?

18:16.375 --> 18:18.171
About the whole left in a car park thing.

18:18.213 --> 18:19.700
Dumping you, and keeping him?

18:19.763 --> 18:21.225
- Shush!
- What?!

18:21.261 --> 18:22.973
I was asleep for ages.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.784
Did you even speak to her?

18:29.419 --> 18:31.898
Detached the heating unit from the wall.

18:32.128 --> 18:33.652
Still got it.

18:49.575 --> 18:51.632
Oh ho! Sweet!

18:54.670 --> 18:56.999
Look for hard drives,

18:57.345 --> 19:00.397
old mobiles, address
books, receipts, anything.

19:00.418 --> 19:01.859
I'll check upstairs.

19:04.134 --> 19:08.107
He's so positive, isn't he?
He's so full of light and hope.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.793
Yeah, he's adorable.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.894
Right up until I have to watch
life kick him in the balls

19:12.904 --> 19:14.527
over and over again.

19:15.441 --> 19:16.647
Mary?

19:22.498 --> 19:23.548
Mary...

19:25.599 --> 19:26.972
Who's this?

19:30.109 --> 19:31.842
Oh, that's Ariel.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.147
That's your brother.

19:33.267 --> 19:34.343
The girl.

19:34.531 --> 19:35.773
Who's the girl?

19:35.794 --> 19:37.438
That's Hawkwind.

19:38.456 --> 19:40.022
She's pretty, isn't she?

19:40.649 --> 19:42.032
They were very young,

19:42.445 --> 19:43.666
but I could hardly object.

19:43.676 --> 19:45.863
It's not like I was
ever the best role model.

19:45.915 --> 19:47.012
Layla.

19:47.727 --> 19:48.677
It's...

19:48.797 --> 19:49.885
Layla.

19:51.177 --> 19:52.769
No. No, love.

19:53.004 --> 19:54.654
That's Hawkwind.

19:55.082 --> 19:56.642
That's your sister-in-law.

19:58.850 --> 20:00.661
Yeah, right in the balls.

20:27.807 --> 20:29.357
Come on, Celine.

20:29.477 --> 20:31.769
He can't take his eyes off you.

20:31.889 --> 20:33.319
Jude?

20:34.029 --> 20:35.226
Really?

20:48.442 --> 20:52.655
Celine, do you know the
origin of the word apocalypse?

20:53.149 --> 20:55.801
The Latin comes from the Greek.

20:56.408 --> 20:59.267
Apokalypsis. To uncover.

20:59.282 --> 21:00.764
- To reveal.
- What if

21:00.811 --> 21:03.834
there is a reason they got
one word from the other?

21:04.152 --> 21:08.030
What if the apocalypse
is meant to reveal us?

21:08.061 --> 21:09.409
Strip us back

21:09.529 --> 21:11.486
to what we are really made of.

21:14.754 --> 21:16.400
How do you do it?

21:16.838 --> 21:18.545
Feed all those people.

21:18.585 --> 21:21.453
You think if I can perform miracles,

21:21.458 --> 21:23.880
I can tell you what to do
with the rest of your life?

21:26.757 --> 21:29.195
OK, Sister Celine...

21:29.634 --> 21:31.210
I'll show you.

21:32.442 --> 21:34.204
Maybe Layla's got a twin too.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.078
I mean, it's not completely
impossible, right?

21:37.781 --> 21:39.537
I'm sure the odds that she didn't know

21:39.568 --> 21:42.089
she had an identical sister aren't great...

21:44.082 --> 21:45.622
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

21:45.742 --> 21:47.830
Ignore me. I don't know what I'm saying.

21:51.291 --> 21:54.793
All my relationships
have been based on lies.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.782
My mum lied to me my whole life.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.308
And Layla...

22:01.707 --> 22:02.634
No,

22:02.806 --> 22:04.184
Hawkwind.

22:04.388 --> 22:06.356
Her name wasn't even...

22:08.376 --> 22:11.226
I didn't even know the name of my own wife.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.172
He'll be all right. He's just...

22:17.877 --> 22:19.474
He'll be fine in a sec.

22:19.865 --> 22:21.876
I know he's disappointed, but

22:21.996 --> 22:24.408
we just have to remind
him that whatever happens,

22:24.434 --> 22:27.169
these worldly concerns are beneath him.

22:27.759 --> 22:30.369
Even if Layla is a bit
of a no-good Delilah,

22:30.662 --> 22:33.574
Jamie walks a different
path from the rest of us.

22:33.794 --> 22:35.605
Uh... OK.

22:36.561 --> 22:39.447
Jamie is divine, Dave. But then,

22:39.468 --> 22:42.255
as his closest disciple,
I'm sure you know that.

22:42.323 --> 22:43.914
His what now?

22:44.829 --> 22:47.992
What we need is a good, strong brew.

22:48.445 --> 22:49.976
Uh...

22:51.229 --> 22:53.343
Ooh... Mary?

22:53.974 --> 22:56.273
What do you mean when
you say Jamie's divine?

22:57.210 --> 22:58.776
You don't know?

22:59.893 --> 23:01.636
Jamie knows, surely.

23:02.398 --> 23:04.335
I've never been a believer,

23:04.455 --> 23:07.440
but then God spoke to me
when the boys were born.

23:07.764 --> 23:09.784
Jamie is special.

23:10.097 --> 23:15.151
Second-born would be
mine, the first was his.

23:16.101 --> 23:17.468
It broke my heart.

23:18.283 --> 23:21.922
But my Jamie was destined for great
things, and I had to be strong.

23:22.224 --> 23:23.737
To this day,

23:24.177 --> 23:25.753
I have to be strong.

23:26.886 --> 23:29.653
Oh, he's only got herbal.

23:29.668 --> 23:32.894
- Will that do?
- Yeah, and just to be clear, Mary...

23:33.353 --> 23:35.493
You left him in a car park because...

23:35.520 --> 23:36.945
Church car park.

23:37.065 --> 23:39.305
A church car park, and you did that why?

23:39.425 --> 23:40.876
Why?

23:42.938 --> 23:46.279
Because Jamie is the son of God.

23:55.878 --> 23:57.867
Why are they celebrating?

23:57.987 --> 23:59.265
Why not?

23:59.594 --> 24:02.538
Better than sitting back waiting for death.

24:08.599 --> 24:10.954
If a ship doesn't pass inspection,

24:10.995 --> 24:12.906
or they can't pay their taxes,

24:13.136 --> 24:15.135
the containers sit here for months.

24:15.344 --> 24:18.137
Food rotting while people
go hungry on the other side.

24:18.142 --> 24:19.813
And you tell them it comes from God.

24:19.854 --> 24:22.966
No. No, I just don't correct them.

24:23.242 --> 24:25.899
Better than get caught
and lose our supplies.

24:27.653 --> 24:29.882
Fucking H Christ!

24:29.888 --> 24:32.138
- I am not the Messiah!
- Hey, hey...

24:32.164 --> 24:33.360
Inside voice.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.296
None of the Layla stuff is Mary's fault.

24:35.328 --> 24:38.324
Now, Mrs. C, are we sure
about the Messiah thing?

24:38.522 --> 24:40.126
I heard what I heard.

24:40.678 --> 24:41.810
Mary,

24:42.030 --> 24:47.672
God doesn't speak to people
outside of Charlton Heston films.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.726
God definitely didn't speak to anyone

24:50.737 --> 24:52.913
in Slough in the '80s.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.317
You were unwell.

24:54.370 --> 24:57.100
No, not back then. I wasn't sick then.

24:57.115 --> 24:59.757
You heard a voice in your head,

24:59.956 --> 25:02.639
and you left a newborn baby

25:02.759 --> 25:05.818
in a cold, empty car park.

25:05.828 --> 25:07.259
Church car park.

25:07.327 --> 25:09.227
You left me...

25:09.769 --> 25:11.283
at night...

25:11.403 --> 25:13.591
in the middle of winter.

25:13.769 --> 25:15.548
I could have died.

25:15.668 --> 25:18.659
But you didn't. I knew you wouldn't.

25:18.779 --> 25:22.355
How is it that everyone I'm related to

25:22.396 --> 25:26.009
- is completely barking insane?!
- Come on, Jamie. Come here.

25:29.731 --> 25:31.151
What the hell is wrong with you?

25:31.762 --> 25:33.581
She thinks I'm...

25:34.492 --> 25:37.921
I think I have the right
to be a little bit really

25:37.942 --> 25:40.521
- fucking angry right now!
- Keep your voice down,

25:40.552 --> 25:43.517
and try not to make this all
about you just this once, yeah?

25:43.857 --> 25:46.054
It kind of is about me, isn't it?

25:46.174 --> 25:48.800
What were you expecting when
you rescued her from that place?

25:48.805 --> 25:50.794
You took responsibility
for her, and for what?

25:50.820 --> 25:53.070
So you could break her heart the
minute it turns out she's actually

25:53.096 --> 25:54.260
properly mentally ill?

25:54.265 --> 25:56.526
- No, of course not.
- Listen, I know

25:56.556 --> 25:59.725
Layla did a number on you, and I'm
sorry. I really am, but it's time

25:59.735 --> 26:01.901
to start thinking about other people now.

26:01.912 --> 26:03.582
Like Mary. Like Paula.

26:03.582 --> 26:05.556
Paula? What's Mum got to do with this?

26:05.571 --> 26:07.435
Paula rescued you from the car park!

26:07.466 --> 26:09.434
Paula raised you. I mean,
have you called her this week?

26:09.450 --> 26:12.451
No, I know you haven't,
because I did, and she's gutted.

26:14.335 --> 26:16.705
Look, you're upset, of course you
are, but we're all upset, mate.

26:16.726 --> 26:17.947
Everyone's scared,

26:18.542 --> 26:22.144
so stop being a bell-end, and
stop taking people for granted.

26:23.741 --> 26:25.870
I'm going back to searching, OK?

26:27.879 --> 26:29.592
So, what do you get out of this?

26:29.649 --> 26:31.925
What do you get out of being a priest?

26:31.988 --> 26:34.405
I help people. Try not to be a dick.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.336
If it's been a good day,
I sleep better at night.

26:38.853 --> 26:40.455
But, you healed people.

26:40.471 --> 26:42.089
You saved that man's life.

26:42.105 --> 26:45.467
No, I offered first aid.

26:45.587 --> 26:46.746
That's all.

26:47.117 --> 26:48.761
What? Are you disappointed?

26:48.985 --> 26:50.317
Maybe a little.

26:52.196 --> 26:53.945
Are you going to denounce me, then?

26:54.368 --> 26:56.148
Expose the awful truth?

26:56.409 --> 26:58.616
I think the least we can
do is look the other way.

26:58.919 --> 27:00.792
You can do a little bit more than that.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.401
Don't you think?

27:09.485 --> 27:13.072
He that hath pity on the
poor landeth onto the Lord.

27:13.108 --> 27:14.491
Amen.

27:41.738 --> 27:44.720
Stopped seeing the tattoo, but
that's really you, isn't it?

27:45.633 --> 27:48.712
Well, maybe we both saw
what we needed to see.

27:51.386 --> 27:52.935
What is all this?

27:53.656 --> 27:56.711
Water purifier? Freeze-dried hotdogs!

27:56.870 --> 27:59.174
You really believe this
stuff's going to save you?

27:59.205 --> 28:02.326
Yes, ma'am. We've got the
best bunker in ten blocks.

28:02.379 --> 28:04.580
Except for Mark. He's got a hot tub.

28:05.031 --> 28:08.659
We's get saved on account
of we're the chosen ones.

28:08.910 --> 28:10.382
Because we're pure.

28:10.847 --> 28:12.569
Pure? Are you...

28:13.337 --> 28:15.727
Are we talking about skin colour again?

28:16.046 --> 28:17.417
I have news for you.

28:17.858 --> 28:20.651
Even if you survive the comet,
which you won't, by the way,

28:20.655 --> 28:22.347
after that comes earthquakes,

28:22.409 --> 28:25.312
tsunamis, acid rain, you name it.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.259
It's an extinction-level event.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.475
That means White people die,
that means Black people die,

28:30.480 --> 28:32.818
that means we all die!

28:33.961 --> 28:35.726
What did I tell you, kids?

28:35.736 --> 28:37.856
Some folks are real ignorant.

28:39.568 --> 28:43.289
I say we hold off on
calling the cops for now.

28:43.566 --> 28:48.218
Little miss high and mighty here used
a kid as a human shield last week.

28:49.147 --> 28:52.049
The reward for this bitch
is only going to go up.

29:10.579 --> 29:11.866
Ha!

29:12.767 --> 29:14.694
Got you, you wanker.

29:14.882 --> 29:16.682
You should know that

29:16.860 --> 29:18.911
I'm not anyone special.

29:19.809 --> 29:23.066
OK? I'm just an ordinary guy. Like Ariel.

29:23.296 --> 29:25.812
Well, not exactly like him, but...

29:26.788 --> 29:28.996
You get what I'm saying, right?

29:29.382 --> 29:30.426
I'm not...

29:31.318 --> 29:32.453
holy.

29:39.544 --> 29:41.439
_

29:41.486 --> 29:42.832
_

29:45.301 --> 29:48.063
_

29:54.207 --> 29:55.980
_

29:56.503 --> 29:58.622
- _
- Get in!

30:01.237 --> 30:02.898
Naughty naughty...

30:02.955 --> 30:05.419
Now the house is going to blow...

30:05.539 --> 30:07.142
_

30:08.243 --> 30:12.894
This property will
self-destruct in 60 seconds.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.826
Dave? What's going on?

30:16.392 --> 30:18.877
The house is going to blow up. We
should go. We should get out now.

30:22.181 --> 30:24.807
Mary, come on. We've
got to get out of here!

30:26.833 --> 30:29.725
Self-destruct, Mary! Do you hear me?

30:29.756 --> 30:31.259
40 seconds...

30:31.511 --> 30:34.408
- Mary!
- Come on, what the hell are you doing?

30:34.444 --> 30:36.015
Get the hell out of there!

30:36.135 --> 30:38.046
Mum? Please...

30:38.735 --> 30:42.055
Self-destruct in 30 seconds.

30:42.070 --> 30:44.926
Mary Conroy, you did it.

30:45.709 --> 30:49.222
I tested your faith, but you held strong.

30:49.269 --> 30:51.252
Self-destruct in 20 seconds.

30:51.262 --> 30:55.277
I was ungrateful, and...

30:56.634 --> 30:58.487
... ungodly.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.901
- Now it's time to follow me.
- Self-destruct

31:02.129 --> 31:04.003
- in 10 seconds.
- Come!

31:04.123 --> 31:07.093
- Come with me.
- I knew. It's true.

31:07.109 --> 31:08.931
Yes, it's true.

31:08.998 --> 31:10.658
I'm the son of God.

31:10.674 --> 31:13.289
Now let's get the fuck out of here.

31:13.336 --> 31:15.377
Self-destruct in three...

31:15.915 --> 31:17.564
two...

31:17.982 --> 31:19.250
one...

31:42.260 --> 31:43.774
Are you excited for this?

31:43.894 --> 31:45.173
I know I am.

31:46.604 --> 31:49.250
Enter General, stage left.

31:51.693 --> 31:55.034
And the curtain rises
on this evening's show...

31:59.769 --> 32:02.870
We're going to have to do
something about that, aren't we...

32:03.918 --> 32:05.333
Crap!

32:29.000 --> 32:32.294
_

32:32.723 --> 32:35.114
_

33:49.517 --> 33:51.857
Very boring, Spike.

33:51.925 --> 33:53.961
I had this whole thing

33:54.081 --> 33:58.497
beautifully choreographed, and
now you've thrown it right out.

33:59.818 --> 34:01.113
Shame...

34:01.859 --> 34:06.167
Now you're going to miss the show.

34:08.119 --> 34:09.804
Looking for us?

34:23.531 --> 34:25.224
Gun down, soldier.

34:31.054 --> 34:32.696
Kick it to me.

34:41.789 --> 34:44.190
- You brought what I asked for?
- Uh-huh.

34:44.431 --> 34:46.010
Show me.

34:53.828 --> 34:55.310
Map to the bunker.

34:58.213 --> 35:01.528
- And one of the keys.
- One? That wasn't the deal.

35:01.648 --> 35:05.103
Well, if you know anything about the
keys, you know both are necessary.

35:05.116 --> 35:08.013
We don't get in without you,
you don't get in without us.

35:08.431 --> 35:09.737
Fine.

35:10.388 --> 35:13.520
I need three places in
the bunker guaranteed.

35:13.814 --> 35:16.574
- Three?
- Three.

35:19.752 --> 35:21.566
We can arrange that.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.379
Throw it here.

35:30.224 --> 35:31.855
Who's the third place for?

35:32.970 --> 35:33.933
What?

35:34.053 --> 35:36.415
Well, one place for you. We assume one

35:36.481 --> 35:40.089
for Moscow girl. Who's the third?

35:41.217 --> 35:42.737
What did you say?

35:43.168 --> 35:44.780
You know, your

35:44.900 --> 35:47.729
Interpol file is a real page-turner.

35:48.303 --> 35:49.974
So, the woman in Moscow,

35:50.013 --> 35:51.474
the one who nearly got you caught,

35:51.520 --> 35:53.941
does she know you're doing this for her?

35:54.346 --> 35:56.453
You don't know what you're talking about.

35:57.791 --> 36:00.447
Obviously, you realised she set you up,

36:00.480 --> 36:04.577
but you still came out of
hiding just to talk to her.

36:05.647 --> 36:07.781
I saw the photos. She's...

36:07.901 --> 36:09.444
She's very beautiful.

36:09.686 --> 36:13.040
Throw me the envelope,
or the kid dies. Now.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.615
What's her name, the Moscow girl?

36:16.648 --> 36:18.312
Shut up.

36:18.432 --> 36:20.693
Have you told her yet? Have you told her

36:20.889 --> 36:22.344
how you're going to save her?

36:22.383 --> 36:23.779
Are you kidding me?!

36:23.899 --> 36:25.671
Give me the envelope,

36:25.704 --> 36:28.568
or I'll kill the kid! I will.

36:28.594 --> 36:30.904
- Does she know about the bunker is all?
- What?!

36:30.943 --> 36:34.583
- Does she know about the bunker?
- No, no.

36:34.629 --> 36:36.410
OK? She doesn't.

36:36.417 --> 36:39.405
- What about third place? Do they know?
- No-one knows!

36:39.419 --> 36:41.109
Oh, no-one knows...

36:41.565 --> 36:42.662
No!

36:42.949 --> 36:45.559
He'll be dead before I even hit the...

36:48.534 --> 36:50.068
Spike...

36:56.600 --> 36:59.112
Whatever this is, you're
going to sleep it off.

36:59.530 --> 37:01.957
OK, buddy? You're going to be fine.

37:08.033 --> 37:10.917
- You shouldn't have come.
- You were going to kill him.

37:11.037 --> 37:13.044
What a way to stop me,
by almost killing him.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.151
We're supposed to be saving people.

37:15.584 --> 37:17.213
Right, then...

37:17.611 --> 37:20.058
Do we take him to the hospital?

37:21.141 --> 37:23.516
First we get rid of the evidence.

37:28.222 --> 37:32.078
Reporting on mark C, mark F and mark G.

37:32.620 --> 37:34.505
We have a situation.

37:36.150 --> 37:38.016
No, not Mark.

37:38.342 --> 37:42.309
The marks, as in the targets, the subjects.

37:45.023 --> 37:47.451
No, there's no-one called Mark.

37:47.464 --> 37:49.291
It's not even about...

37:49.513 --> 37:51.914
They've made contact, and it's not pretty.

37:51.979 --> 37:54.492
We need new orders ASAP.

37:55.796 --> 37:57.551
Sodding code names.

37:58.165 --> 38:00.305
No-one bothers to learn them apart from us.

38:04.044 --> 38:05.819
I am drunk.

38:06.413 --> 38:08.174
Yes, you are.

38:10.001 --> 38:11.065
Jude...

38:11.796 --> 38:13.316
Are you happy?

38:14.604 --> 38:16.552
Am I happy... ?

38:17.707 --> 38:19.241
You don't seem happy.

38:19.717 --> 38:21.602
Why not leave?

38:24.088 --> 38:25.494
What?

38:26.045 --> 38:27.781
The Church? No.

38:29.673 --> 38:31.624
You never thought about it?

38:34.450 --> 38:36.903
Look, my option is up in three weeks.

38:37.327 --> 38:39.060
I might as well stick it out.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.673
This is why I did not
tell you about Napoli.

38:41.793 --> 38:43.350
You take nothing seriously.

38:43.671 --> 38:45.183
Come on.

38:45.555 --> 38:48.700
Death is when people
like you and I clean up.

38:49.007 --> 38:50.776
I mean, we've put in the time.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.562
The comet hits, we go
right to the VIP room.

38:58.848 --> 39:01.510
I do wish you'd told me
more about yourself, though.

39:03.996 --> 39:06.483
I'm sorry you were
dealt such a crappy hand.

39:07.036 --> 39:11.108
I took vows because the convent
was the only home I ever had.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.666
But now,

39:13.666 --> 39:16.393
do you ever wonder what
kind of person you would be?

39:18.077 --> 39:19.623
I know exactly

39:19.675 --> 39:22.050
the kind of person I would
be without the Church.

39:24.661 --> 39:27.308
Well, I am glad you are a priest.

39:28.119 --> 39:30.272
And I am glad I met you.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.046
No more alcohol for you.

39:37.985 --> 39:39.589
Ever.

39:39.709 --> 39:41.626
OK.

39:45.391 --> 39:47.877
- What, what... ?!
- Shush.

39:47.909 --> 39:49.417
Keep it down, damn it.

39:49.537 --> 39:51.153
I slipped a mickey in the meatloaf,

39:51.205 --> 39:54.070
but Big Todd up there has a high tolerance.

39:55.512 --> 39:58.103
- What? What?!
- Get up.

39:59.323 --> 40:02.461
I filled up the tank, and
packed you up some food.

40:02.970 --> 40:06.578
Minced steak and milkshakes,
but beggars can't be choosers.

40:08.700 --> 40:11.806
You think I didn't know
about your husband, dumb ass?

40:11.838 --> 40:14.044
His picture's been all over the TV.

40:16.044 --> 40:17.541
Take it.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.966
- Leanne...
- You'd better spend it.

40:22.125 --> 40:25.998
This shit's gonna be just about fit
to wipe your ass with pretty quick.

40:27.577 --> 40:29.318
You can come with me, you know.

40:32.299 --> 40:35.068
I got my people, and you got yours.

40:35.714 --> 40:38.709
- You don't want me in DC.
- Who says I don't?!

40:38.729 --> 40:39.798
Oh, yeah?

40:40.660 --> 40:43.302
You'd be OK introducing me to your son?

40:45.044 --> 40:47.543
Think your husband would shake my hand?

40:55.465 --> 40:58.146
Well, you take care of yourself now, hon.

41:00.156 --> 41:02.708
You have yourself a real good apocalypse.

41:05.233 --> 41:06.677
You too, Leanne.

41:30.993 --> 41:33.257
Mary's in there making
friends with everyone.

41:33.263 --> 41:37.727
I would complain, but she scored
us the last packet of... What?

41:37.759 --> 41:39.527
What's happened now?

41:40.186 --> 41:42.007
Hang onto this for me?

41:47.638 --> 41:49.518
You decided where we're going yet?

41:50.471 --> 41:51.984
We're going home.

41:54.085 --> 41:56.102
We're going back to Slough.

42:15.076 --> 42:18.280
I mean, the white horse
could be dead out there.

42:18.945 --> 42:21.235
It's like Schrodinger's cat

42:21.236 --> 42:23.167
with a car and a cyber terrorist.

42:23.206 --> 42:25.438
- He's both dead and undead.
- Scotty...

42:25.445 --> 42:28.427
- I'm a murderer and not a murderer, simultaneously...
- Scotty!

42:29.797 --> 42:30.893
Come here.

42:40.172 --> 42:41.607
If we take

42:41.727 --> 42:44.303
the white horse to the
hospital, and he wakes up

42:44.362 --> 42:45.569
that's it,

42:46.078 --> 42:48.714
we can kiss Mount Genesis goodbye.

43:02.645 --> 43:04.595
I don't know who we are any more.

43:05.972 --> 43:09.065
We're the idiots trying
to save the human race.

43:23.993 --> 43:25.592
Welcome to your new home.

43:25.644 --> 43:27.412
Wonderful.

43:27.532 --> 43:31.060
OK, if this is about that Second
Coming crap, you picked a bad time.

43:31.060 --> 43:32.848
- My mom's in DC!
- What?!

43:34.107 --> 43:36.299
Funny-looking thing, isn't he?

43:36.476 --> 43:38.955
OK, I want every exit sealed.

43:39.075 --> 43:40.528
You made your choice.

43:41.904 --> 43:43.341
Mary!

43:51.379 --> 43:53.722
Maybe a few deep breaths...
