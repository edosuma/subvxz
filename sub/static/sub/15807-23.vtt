00:04.839 --> 00:06.805
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:06.874 --> 00:09.508
¶ That started from
      this tropic port ¶

00:09.576 --> 00:11.843

Ah, gotcha! Now, an
     edge in my collection.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.542
If I could figure how
     to get us out of here.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.976
Help! Help!

02:25.045 --> 02:26.811
Somebody's yellin' for help.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.979
It's Mary Ann.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.748
Oh! I'll get you later.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.750
Somebody help!

02:32.819 --> 02:35.420
Hold on! I'll
      save you, Mary Ann.

Oh! Save me!

Here, Mary..

02:44.598 --> 02:46.265
Mary Ann.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.934
Help!

(Gilligan)
          'Mary Ann..'

02:52.039 --> 02:53.038
Help.

- Help!
            - Help!

Hang on!

(Gilligan)

Help!

[Mary Ann gasping]

03:02.882 --> 03:05.550
Calm down, Mary Ann.

     'Come here, Gilligan.'

03:30.143 --> 03:32.343
Now, when I get
this picture..

03:32.412 --> 03:34.846
...I'm going to put it
on the front page

03:34.915 --> 03:36.714
of every newspaper in my chain

03:36.783 --> 03:39.217
with the caption,
"Heroic rescue at sea."

03:39.286 --> 03:41.686
There we are, Skipper,
hold it! Ha ha. There..

03:41.755 --> 03:44.522
Now take one of me presenting
 our hero with the check.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.958
It goes with the Howell
Medal for Bravery.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.827
The Howell Medal for Bravery?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.262
You deserve it, Skipper.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.798
I've been saving this film
 for such a suitable occasion.

03:53.867 --> 03:57.336
There you are, Lovey, smile.
  Ha ha! There you are.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.938
Now, let's get one
with Mary Ann.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.372
Oh, another picture, Mr. Howell?

04:01.441 --> 04:03.675
We newshawks get
            our nose in a story.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.576
Let me tell you something,
      we're insatiable.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.179
Now, our hero and the little
  girl that he rescued.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.514
(Thurston)
        'There we are.'

04:09.583 --> 04:12.350
Gilligan, will you get
    out of the way, please?

04:12.419 --> 04:14.620
Sure, Mr. Howell.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.956
Now, will you show
     a little knee, please?

04:18.024 --> 04:20.391
[chuckling]

04:20.459 --> 04:23.428
Not you, Skipper.
       Mary Ann.

(Thurston)
         'Cheesecake.'

04:26.700 --> 04:30.301
Now...ah, just what I like.
A leafy background.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.237
Will you get out
of there, my boy?

04:32.305 --> 04:36.941
Uh, Mary Ann, nice...pose.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.811
Isn't it exciting having
   a real hero on the island?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.546
Yeah.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.284
Skipper will go down in
    history like John Paul Jones

04:46.353 --> 04:50.388
or Horatio Hornblower
        or Henrich van Rootbaum.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.890
Henrich van Rootbaum?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.593
Yes, the little Dutch boy
       who held his finger

04:54.662 --> 04:56.795
in the dike and
             saved a whole city.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.162
Oh.

04:58.231 --> 05:01.667
He held his finger in a dike and
saved a whole city? Which one?

05:01.735 --> 05:05.604
I'm not quite sure, but
        I think it was this one.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.605
There you are, Skipper.
    Just one more.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.975
That's it. Hold it,
      hold it, hold it.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.178
Oh...he's handsome, isn't he?

05:13.246 --> 05:17.115
I swam out to save her. I dove
in, swam as fast as I could--

05:17.184 --> 05:18.683
Yes, Gilligan.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.086
The water was cold, but I jumped
anyway. I was swimming hard..

05:22.155 --> 05:25.557
Did you see me dove in the water
to swim to Mary Ann?

05:25.626 --> 05:26.958
- I swam very fast--
      - I didn't.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.461
All I saw was Skipper
     carrying you both out.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.996
You must be proud to have
       such a brave skipper.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.432
Yeah.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.399
There you are. Get closer
   together. That's it.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.901
I like that..

05:36.970 --> 05:39.905
Ooh, that's.. Ooh, that's gonna
look so good in the paper.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.107
[giggling]

05:42.176 --> 05:45.276
(Thurston)
'There's only one picture left,
and I want it to be good.'

05:45.345 --> 05:46.644
Uh, where's Gilligan?

05:46.713 --> 05:49.147
You want me? You want me
    in the picture?

05:49.216 --> 05:51.450
No, no, no.
I want you to take it.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.118
I want to be in it.
Get in the picture, Ginger.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.921
Ah, Ginger, you sit here
and Professor, you in the back.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.590
Makes nice composition.
 Everyone look at the skipper.

05:59.659 --> 06:01.393
Is everybody ready?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.866
Oh, that was very, very nice..

06:07.934 --> 06:10.368
I'm going to see you
on the front page.

06:10.437 --> 06:11.769
- Thank you, Mr. Howell.
    - Thank you.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.839
And you were marvelous
too, you know?

06:14.907 --> 06:18.709
I'm going to give you a list
of words, and I want you to say

06:18.778 --> 06:22.880
the first thing that comes
   to mind when I say them.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.049
- Ready?
            - Hmm.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.952
- A marshmallow.
        - Ouch!

06:29.289 --> 06:31.556
- Sunsets.
           - Ouch!

06:31.624 --> 06:34.492
- Tree.
            - Ouch!

06:34.561 --> 06:36.494
Really, Gilligan,
I can't psychoanalyze you

06:36.563 --> 06:38.096
if all you can say is "Ouch."

06:38.165 --> 06:42.333
I don't know, Mrs. Howell. Maybe
it's because I'm sitting on..

06:42.402 --> 06:46.171
...this and...this.

06:50.144 --> 06:52.110
Oh, there you are, Thurston.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.379
Please, Lovey,
          not while I'm putting.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.481
I thought you'd want
    to hear about Gilligan.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.916
Well, we do.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.950
What's wrong with
my little buddy?

07:00.019 --> 07:01.453
You.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.887
- Me?
         - 'Yes, you.'

07:02.956 --> 07:04.956
In his subconscious
mind, he envies you.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.359
- He wants to be like you.
  - Well, that seems strange.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.927
What seems strange about it?

07:09.996 --> 07:12.997
Well, I can, I mean, uh,
        envying me, but--

07:13.066 --> 07:16.001
What's wrong with envying me?
 After all, I am a hero.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.604
That's Gilligan's problem.
You're a hero, and he's not.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.273
That makes him feel small
and insignificant.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.342
It gives him a sense
of inferiority.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.977
Oh, it's a very simple neurosis.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.179
(Mrs. Howell)
    'Somewhat like
    an inferiority complex.'

07:28.248 --> 07:31.583
Inferiority complex? Heavens,
   I hope it isn't catchy.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.718
Mrs. Howell, what can
     we do to cure this?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.853
Well, uh, Gilligan
needs recognition.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.788
Something for his ego, I mean.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.158
I see. He wants
       to be a hero, huh?

07:40.226 --> 07:42.661
I know just the guy
      who can arrange it.

07:42.729 --> 07:43.495
Who?

07:43.564 --> 07:45.697
That little old hero maker, me.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.468
Just a little further, Ginger.

07:51.405 --> 07:53.171
Here we are.
Now, what do you see?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.740
But it looks like
             a fallen log to me.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.376
Exactly, but it's the answer
to Gilligan's problems.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.879
It's gonna make a hero
out of him. Watch.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.317
Oh, be careful, Skipper.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.651
[grunting]

08:06.719 --> 08:09.520
Oh, don't worry. I know
exactly what I'm doing.

08:09.589 --> 08:11.722
Now, here's the plan.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.524
I'm gonna be trapped
under this tree

08:13.593 --> 08:15.861
and Gilligan's gonna
save me. Get it?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.629
Oh, yeah. Well, what
      am I supposed to do?

08:18.698 --> 08:20.932
I want you to run back
and get Gilligan.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.035
I'm trapped under here, and I'll
lie here and moan and groan.

08:25.104 --> 08:27.639
Oh...oh!

08:28.341 --> 08:29.841
How does that sound?

08:29.910 --> 08:32.677
You gotta project a little more.
You know, from the diaphragm.

08:32.745 --> 08:37.047
Like this.
         Oh-h! Oh-h-h!

08:37.116 --> 08:40.384
Oh! Oh!

08:40.453 --> 08:44.188
No. Oh-h-h! Oh-h-h!

08:44.256 --> 08:49.427
Oh! Oh! Oh!

08:49.495 --> 08:51.095
How do you like that?

08:51.164 --> 08:53.731
Well, Richard Burton's got
   nothing to worry about.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.167
You keep practicing.
     I'll go get Gilligan.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.836
(Ginger)
            Help!

08:57.905 --> 08:59.837
Help!

08:59.906 --> 09:01.139
Oh-h-h!

09:03.409 --> 09:05.409
Oh-h-h!

09:05.478 --> 09:06.945
[tribal music]

09:10.250 --> 09:12.049
[Skipper groaning]

09:12.118 --> 09:14.986
(Ginger)
    'Gilligan, help!
    The Skipper needs you.'

09:15.055 --> 09:17.122
Help! Somebody help the Skipper.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.524
[thud]

09:19.593 --> 09:21.025
What's the matter?

09:21.094 --> 09:22.827
Oh, it's nothing.
         It's just for Gilligan.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.996
Gilligan, help!
     The Skipper needs you.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.731
Here I am.
What's the matter?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.033
The most terrible thing has
happened to the skipper.

09:29.101 --> 09:32.103
A tree fell on him. You've
      got to help save his life.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.406
Oh, I've got to save his life.
Only one thing, which way?

09:35.475 --> 09:39.044
- Down the end of the path.
 - Okay. Follow me, follow me.

09:44.784 --> 09:47.152
Maybe, I better follow you.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.189
[dramatic music]

09:52.258 --> 09:54.192
A-a-ah!

09:59.665 --> 10:00.899
Here I come, Skipper.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.770
(Gilligan)
'Don't lose your head, Skipper.'

10:07.474 --> 10:09.674
[trumpet music]

10:11.010 --> 10:13.077
Here I am.
        Are you alright?

10:13.146 --> 10:15.180
Oh, thank heavens.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.581
Gilligan, you're the only one
 who can save me.

10:17.650 --> 10:18.983
[groans]

10:19.052 --> 10:21.819
Get that heavy log off him.
You gotta do something.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.788
I don't know.
           It's quite a problem.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.457
[Skipper groans]

10:25.525 --> 10:27.058
Sorry, Skipper.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.194
Gilligan, I don't mean to
   tell you how to be a hero

10:30.263 --> 10:33.798
but if I were you, I would think
about Archimedes and his rule.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.001
- Of what and who?
       - Archimedes.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.336
He's the man who said,
     "Give me a lever..

10:38.405 --> 10:39.971
"...and I will move the world."

10:40.040 --> 10:42.240
Oh, yeah. Well, maybe,
          we ought to get him.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.308
He's been dead for
       over a 1000 years.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.244
Yeah? Well, isn't it kinda
     late to be bringing him up?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.047
Oh!

10:49.116 --> 10:50.214
Oh-h!

10:50.283 --> 10:52.083
Gilligan, you've got
      to do something.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.052
Look, he's suffering,
     the poor Skipper.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.453
I don't know-know
               quite what to do.

10:56.522 --> 11:00.258
Oh, Gilligan, if you were lying
under here, and I was you

11:00.326 --> 11:03.328
I'd look around, and I'd
realize I could make some rope

11:03.396 --> 11:04.863
out of those vines.

11:04.931 --> 11:08.099
Then, I can put it around that
tree and use it for leverage.

11:08.167 --> 11:11.502
I wish you wouldn't talk so
much. It's hard for me to think.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.572
Oh, I know. I'll take
  this vine, make into a rope.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.875
I can throw it over there,
     tie it on the bottom there.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.478
- And I get some leverage.
- Now, you're getting somewhere.

11:20.547 --> 11:23.614
You see, you give me a little
 time, I can figure out things.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.250
Oh, aren't I lucky

11:25.318 --> 11:28.252
to have a hero like Gilligan
  come to rescue me?

11:28.321 --> 11:30.855
Oh, yes, isn't it wonderful?
 He's one in a million, Skipper

11:30.923 --> 11:32.523
just one in a million.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.158
Oh, what's going on here?

11:34.227 --> 11:37.562
Skipper's pinned under the log.
Gilligan's gonna get him out.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.096
Oh, isn't it exciting?

11:39.165 --> 11:41.599
We're actually gonna see
    a real hero in action.

11:41.668 --> 11:44.068
Oh, Gilligan, you're wonderful.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.372
This calls for a celebration.
 Let's go back and celebrate.

11:47.440 --> 11:51.009
Wait a minute, Mrs. Howell.
I don't wanna be a party-pooper

11:51.077 --> 11:54.278
but our hero hasn't
      done anything, yet.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.782
Oh, yes. W-well, go ahead
   and do something.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.218
Don't just stand there.
Save the man's life.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.220
Yes, ma'am.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.089
Gilligan.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.191
[groaning]

12:07.760 --> 12:08.793
Oh-h-h.

12:08.862 --> 12:09.994
[log creaks]

12:10.063 --> 12:11.863
Okay, Skipper.
         Get ready now.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.397
Ready? Pull
                   your legs up.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.200
[all scream]

12:16.736 --> 12:18.302
Nice going, Gilligan.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.105
I'm sorry, but they're not
making vines like they used to.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.041
- What do we do?
   - Let's get the Professor.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.176
He'll know what to do,
     he's a Professor.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.278
Oh, right. You boys
     stay wherever you are.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.847
Oh, don't go away.
We'll be right back.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.117
[tribal music]

12:37.023 --> 12:39.757
Cheer up, Skipper. The Professor
will be here in a minute

12:39.825 --> 12:41.959
and he'll figure out something.

12:42.028 --> 12:45.563
I hope so. I've got
a terrible headache.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.866
I feel like my head
is gonna split.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.202
- You got any aspirin?
- No, I haven't got any aspirin.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.005
Let's see. What else
      can you do for a headache?

12:54.074 --> 12:56.074
(Mrs. Howell)
     'This way, Professor.'

13:00.046 --> 13:03.314
There they are. We were all set
to hail the conquering hero

13:03.383 --> 13:05.383
and now look at them.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.453
I see. We'll have you out
  in a jiffy. Come on, girls.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.721
- Give me a hand here.
     - Come on, girls.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.791
Ready? One, two, three..

13:13.859 --> 13:16.527
[grunting]

13:16.596 --> 13:18.162
Thanks a lot, Professor.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.564
Oh, I knew the professor
would know what to do.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.535
- Now, we can have our party.
 - Thank you, Professor.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.636
(Mrs. Howell)
         Come on..

13:25.705 --> 13:27.605
All I needed was some help.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.541
Maybe, I should've asked that
 headhunter there for a hand.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.343
[dramatic music]

13:33.980 --> 13:36.114
[screaming]

13:41.020 --> 13:42.253
[instrumental music]

13:44.557 --> 13:46.957
I tell you I saw him,
         a great big headhunter.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.692
Yes, yes, I know.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.862
It's true. He had skulls tied
   around his waist, a big spear

13:51.931 --> 13:52.930
and on his side--

13:52.998 --> 13:54.432
Now, you drink this.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.271
You should've seen his eyes.
    His face was painted in..

14:00.340 --> 14:02.073
What was that stuff
             you gave me?

14:02.142 --> 14:03.607
That'll make you
sleep, a sedative.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.443
Thanks, Mrs. Howell,
   but you're wasting your time.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.379
Those things don't work
        on me. I remember once..

14:13.119 --> 14:16.254
[instrumental Rock-a-bye Baby]

14:21.027 --> 14:22.960
- How is he?
          - Shh.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.562
He's sleeping now.
   I've given him a sedative.

14:25.631 --> 14:27.298
Imagine that..

14:27.367 --> 14:29.933
He's seeing headhunters. The
   boy's sicker than we thought.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.602
You're right, Thurston.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.639
It wasn't so bad when he was
 having an inferiority complex.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.441
But now, he's having delusions.

14:37.510 --> 14:41.011
My poor little buddy. I'm gonna
have to make a hero out of him

14:41.080 --> 14:42.713
before he goes off his rocker.

14:42.782 --> 14:46.050
You make a hero of him. After
   the way you bungled the job?

14:46.119 --> 14:49.086
This is a job that calls for
    tact, finesse, imagination--

14:49.155 --> 14:51.489
Thurston, that sounds like you.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.526
You guessed it already. I hadn't
even gotten to brilliant or..

14:57.563 --> 14:59.297
[instrumental music]

15:03.803 --> 15:06.070
(Mrs. Howell)
       'Help! Save me.
       Somebody save me.'

15:06.139 --> 15:09.006
[dramatic music]

15:09.075 --> 15:10.507
(Mrs. Howell)
         'Help.'

15:10.576 --> 15:11.576
That's Mrs. Howell.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.447
I'm coming, Mrs. Howell.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.523
Save me. Save me.
               Somebody save me.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.326
'Help. Help.'

15:30.263 --> 15:32.196
Help. Help.
                     Who is it?

15:32.265 --> 15:35.666
- It's me, Gilligan.
     - 'Would you come in.'

15:35.735 --> 15:37.334
My hero.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.570
Mr. Howell. What's
    the matter? What is it?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.572
A tarantula.
                    Save me.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.074
That's not a tarantula, it's
 just a plain old beach spider.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.576
Don't argue.
                    Save me.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.413
Okay, be calm, Mrs. Howell.
  I'll take care of him.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.953
Mrs. Howell, maybe you
better not look, huh.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.022
'One.'

16:00.226 --> 16:03.161
[instrumental Rock-a-bye Baby]

16:15.241 --> 16:18.308
I've got it. I know how to
make a hero out of Gilligan.

16:18.377 --> 16:21.612
- How?
  - See that cliff over there?

16:21.681 --> 16:24.215
Climb to the top and pretend
you've broken your leg.

16:24.283 --> 16:26.450
- Yeah?
    - And you yell for help.

16:26.518 --> 16:27.751
Yes.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.454
Well, Gilligan climbs to the
top, and he carries you down.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.490
- And that way--
   - Wait a minute, Mary Ann.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.525
Gilligan climbs the cliff
       and carries me down

16:34.594 --> 16:37.227
then I would have a broken
      leg and a broken neck.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.829
Hello, Mrs. Howell.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.566
Mary Ann just had a beautiful
   idea for helping Gilligan.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.634
Only I have to
                 die at the end.

16:43.702 --> 16:46.604
I'm afraid it's hopeless. After
all, you know what they say

16:46.672 --> 16:48.973
"Can't make a hero
out of a sow's ear."

16:49.041 --> 16:50.708
Shh.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.743
We gotta help him.
      Just can't give up.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.513
Exactly. We've gotta find
    a way to help poor Gilligan.

16:55.581 --> 16:58.015
- I hear someone say Gilligan?
 - Oh, well...no.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.816
[stammering]
    Eh, well, not exactly..

16:59.885 --> 17:02.519
I just said it's rained
   before, and it will again.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.520
Oh.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.955
Gilligan, will you
              do me a favor?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.958
Would you go pick
               some bananas?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.926
What if I meet
        that headhunter?

17:09.996 --> 17:11.628
Will you stop
               bringing that up?

17:11.696 --> 17:15.132
How many times have I told you,
 there are no headhunters here.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.233
There haven't been
       for 300 years.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.269
Gilligan, I thought
            I convinced you that

17:19.338 --> 17:22.039
that headhunter was a figment
   of your imagination.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.808
Ah, an optical illusion.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.078
Yeah, I guess I was
      just seeing things.

17:28.814 --> 17:31.081
I'm afraid Sigmund Freud
wouldn't touch that boy

17:31.150 --> 17:33.184
with a 10 foot couch.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.352
- Skipper.
         - What is it?

17:35.421 --> 17:37.655
Should I pick the yellow
    or the red bananas

17:37.724 --> 17:39.657
because the yellow
       bananas are green?

17:39.726 --> 17:42.659
- Pick the red ones.
  - But the red ones are pink.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.463
I don't care if you pick
    red, white, and blue bananas

17:45.532 --> 17:48.765
- just pick some bananas.
   - Okay, Skipper.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.501
Blue bananas.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.473
Hey. Gilligan just
           gave me a great idea.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.709
- Oh, what?
     - Let's not talk here.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.011
Let's go somewhere where
        we can be in private.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.480
Come on.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.194
Skipper, are we going to
  discuss Gilligan's problems

18:17.263 --> 18:18.995
or are we going on safari?

18:19.064 --> 18:22.666
I have to find a place where we
could talk without being heard.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.668
Now, here's my idea.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.804
We've got to make Gilligan
  do something heroic, right?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.238
Right.

18:28.307 --> 18:30.608
And he ought to do it
     in front of everyone.

18:30.676 --> 18:33.477
Now, Gilligan's got
   headhunters on the brain.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.679
Let's let him see
       a real headhunter.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.983
Mrs. Howell, I think you have
another costumer for your couch.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.951
You don't understand,
     Mary Ann.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.688
I'll dress up as a headhunter.
 I'll take you all prisoners.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.024
And Gilligan can come
     to your rescue.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.859
It just might work.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.429
You think we can stage it
   without Gilligan finding out?

18:51.497 --> 18:54.599
Don't you worry.
He'll never find out.

19:04.843 --> 19:07.544
I don't know. In my
   opinion, it's a silly idea

19:07.613 --> 19:09.580
for Skipper to dress up
    like a headhunter.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.316
Maybe, I didn't explain right.
There's the Skipper now, Ginger.

19:12.384 --> 19:14.618
Why don't you ask him?

19:14.687 --> 19:17.188
(Ginger)
I was just telling her
I think it's silly

19:17.256 --> 19:19.222
for you to dress up
like a headhunter.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.459
- In the first place--
     - Ah!

19:23.229 --> 19:25.396
Man, that's not
the Skipper.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.542
Lovey, why does he
have all the fun?

19:38.611 --> 19:41.378
I mean, why can't
      I be the headhunter?

19:41.447 --> 19:43.514
Well, after all, dear,
          it was his idea.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.050
You can be the
           headhunter next time.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.952
Ha ha, alright.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.319
[muffled cries]

19:49.388 --> 19:51.522
Oh, look at that.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.794
Well, it is rather
overdoing it, isn't it?

20:00.099 --> 20:00.965
What a get-up.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.233
[laughing]

20:02.301 --> 20:04.601
Oh, Captain,
              you bungled again.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.703
If you want to look
             like a headhunter

20:06.772 --> 20:09.206
those feathers are ridiculous.
  You look like a showgirl.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.208
[growling]

20:11.276 --> 20:13.411
[growling]

20:18.250 --> 20:20.551
Not bad, if I
         say so myself.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.719
Skipper, I came to
      tell you something.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.856
Gosh, can't let Gilligan
    see me like this.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.461
I overheard you talking how
  you're gonna make me a hero

20:30.530 --> 20:32.096
but it won't work.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.998
So you don't have to get all
 dressed up like a headhunter..

20:35.067 --> 20:36.934
Skipper?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.502
Skipper?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.875
Really, Thurston,
what nerve.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.511
Why don't you give him
a piece of your mind?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.280
- Well, uh, um..
        - Go on, dear.

20:49.349 --> 20:52.383
- He can't eat you.
     - Yeah, are you sure?

20:58.123 --> 20:59.857
[mumbling]

21:02.061 --> 21:03.994
Hi, Mrs. Howell.
        Hi, Mr. Howell.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.797
Gilligan, save us, save us,
  you got to save our lives!

21:06.865 --> 21:08.732
Gilligan, save us
from the headhunter.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.101
- Save you from the headhunter?
- Yes, he's gonna kill us.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.704
Oh, yeah? Don't worry
           about it, Mr. Howell.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.840
It's like Mrs. Howell says, he's
a figment of my imagination.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.576
Mrs. Howell is wrong.
The headhunter is for real.

21:19.645 --> 21:22.212
If there's a headhunter here,
I'd like to meet him.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.381
Mr. Headhunter,
meet Mr. Gilligan.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.850
Mr. Gilligan,
meet Mr. Headhunter.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.152
(Gilligan)
What do you know,
it is a headhunter.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.955
- Hiya, Skipper.
        - Argh.

21:31.023 --> 21:34.024
That sounds pretty convincing.
You want me to be a hero, huh?

21:34.093 --> 21:35.726
Well, take this.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.296
[growling]

21:39.365 --> 21:41.032
Pretty good, huh?

21:42.268 --> 21:44.602
- Ow!
             - Eek.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.671
[groaning]

21:50.743 --> 21:52.777
[groaning]

22:00.519 --> 22:02.819
I can't look.
Who's winning now?

22:02.888 --> 22:05.655
Gilligan's alright, but I've
got to bet on the headhunter.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.225
- More wood for your fire.
   - Argh!

22:08.294 --> 22:10.060
Ice cream soda.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.695
Ice cold punch.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.465
What's the name
      of your honey bunch?

22:18.137 --> 22:19.737
[growls]

22:25.878 --> 22:28.412
You know, if they were to
give out Oscars for headhunters

22:28.480 --> 22:30.748
you're a cinch to get one.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.518
Okay, Skipper,
         make her good.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.589
Make way, in and out
      of the windows.

22:39.658 --> 22:41.792
Follow me.
           Woo-hoo!

22:45.297 --> 22:48.499
[banjo music]

22:55.374 --> 22:56.907
[growls]

22:59.845 --> 23:03.114
Skipper, look out for
           the...trees, Skipper.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.651
Are you alright, Skipper?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.821
Ooh!

23:13.425 --> 23:14.691
You won!

23:14.760 --> 23:16.026
- How am I doing?
       - Great.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.828
[growling]

23:19.165 --> 23:21.164
Skipper, how'd you change
   your costume so fast?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.433
Huh?

23:22.502 --> 23:23.767
I liked your other
       outfit better.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.404
- What other outfit?
      - That one.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.974
Run, Skipper.
         Run, run, run!

23:34.246 --> 23:35.645
I'll save you, Skipper!

23:35.714 --> 23:37.648
I'll save you, Skipper.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.753
[screaming]

23:49.161 --> 23:51.896
[instrumental music]

23:58.938 --> 24:01.438
Little buddy, that's
  the bravest thing I ever saw

24:01.507 --> 24:03.407
anybody ever do!

24:03.475 --> 24:05.242
Yeah, it was kind
            of brave, wasn't it?

24:05.311 --> 24:07.311
- Gilligan, you were wonderful
- Gilligan, that was wonderful!

24:07.379 --> 24:10.180
- But promise me one thing.
  - Anything, what is it?

24:10.249 --> 24:13.551
If I ever try to do something
like that again, please stop me.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.753
[groaning]

24:22.128 --> 24:24.695
I sure am proud that
     I did something brave.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.897
Of course, that is
       no surprise to me.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.999
I mean, here I was
      running my family..

24:29.068 --> 24:31.302
Ah, I don't mean
    they run, I mean they..

24:31.370 --> 24:33.870
Well, take my Uncle Ramsey
   for instance, yeah.

24:33.939 --> 24:36.974
He was in the 1st World War
  with a lost battalion.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.409
He was the guide.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.612
So I guess being brave
  just kind of comes natural.

24:42.681 --> 24:45.783
And, uh, in conclusion,
    I would like to say..

24:48.187 --> 24:49.787
Help!

25:00.900 --> 25:02.232
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

25:02.301 --> 25:04.000
¶ They're here for
       a long long time ¶

25:04.069 --> 25:06.202
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:06.271 --> 25:08.004
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:08.073 --> 25:10.340
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:10.409 --> 25:12.142
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:12.210 --> 25:14.645
¶ To make the
      others comfortable ¶

25:14.714 --> 25:16.780
¶ In their tropic island nest ¶

25:16.849 --> 25:19.315
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motor car ¶

25:19.384 --> 25:20.783
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:20.852 --> 25:23.420
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:23.489 --> 25:25.288
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:25.357 --> 25:27.857
¶ So join us here each week,
  my friends ¶

25:27.926 --> 25:29.926
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:29.995 --> 25:32.362
¶ From seven stranded
     castaways ¶

25:32.431 --> 25:34.665
¶ Here on Gilligan's Isle ¶
