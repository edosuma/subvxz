00:56.400 --> 00:57.960
Katie Fitch, History AS exam.

00:59.542 --> 01:01.440
Good to see you back, Katie.

01:01.778 --> 01:03.080
History at the back there.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.416
Kids, you can turn over your papers,
and no funny business.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.883
Let's get ready to rumble!

01:54.327 --> 01:55.449
Can I come in?

01:57.717 --> 01:59.167
How about some sun?

02:00.514 --> 02:02.534
- Don't.
- I think so.

02:06.202 --> 02:08.244
Come and do PlayStation with James.

02:10.419 --> 02:12.208
I could fix your hair.

02:12.328 --> 02:14.996
What difference would it make?
Still look awful.

02:16.034 --> 02:17.639
Marks don't last.

02:17.955 --> 02:19.067
They cover up.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.773
I rang college today
about your history exam.

02:26.045 --> 02:27.796
Why? I told you not to!

02:28.271 --> 02:29.984
It's important!

02:30.394 --> 02:32.439
They said you can sit it later.

02:32.649 --> 02:34.068
When you're yourself.

02:35.646 --> 02:37.468
I'm rubbish at history anyway.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.345
Rubbish at everything.

02:40.105 --> 02:41.040
Not like Emily.

02:41.201 --> 02:42.467
Oh, hush!

02:44.335 --> 02:47.659
I hope they lock that Stonem girl up
when they find her.

03:15.088 --> 03:16.088
Nice job.

03:17.314 --> 03:18.120
Stop it!

03:18.280 --> 03:20.027
Don't. It took fucking ages!

03:22.095 --> 03:24.122
Wish I had someone
to pass my exams for me.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.735
I hope you're gonna finish the job
and dump Freddie for her as well.

03:27.855 --> 03:30.080
That's over. Katie knows it.

03:32.487 --> 03:34.280
It was an eventful barbecue.

03:35.052 --> 03:37.639
Adultery makes a party go
with such a swing!

03:38.675 --> 03:39.930
It's not funny.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.735
- Effy hurt her.
- Like I said, it was eventful.

03:46.001 --> 03:47.932
You should dress up more often.

03:48.052 --> 03:49.307
They're Katie's.

03:49.427 --> 03:51.122
Yeah? You look nice.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.761
From the neck down.

04:00.898 --> 04:03.161
I think I'm going away
for the summer.

04:06.419 --> 04:08.551
Spain, Cyprus perhaps.

04:09.055 --> 04:10.055
By myself.

04:10.926 --> 04:14.251
Spend some time by myself,
you know? Do some thinking.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.046
By... myself.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.599
About what?

04:20.399 --> 04:21.839
Let's just be friends, OK?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.473
We say that, don't we?

04:26.886 --> 04:28.336
Have a good summer.

04:33.596 --> 04:34.600
I'll miss you.

04:49.118 --> 04:50.902
I can't stand it. I can't.

04:52.295 --> 04:53.120
It's OK.

04:59.786 --> 05:02.021
Christ. Let's get out of here.

05:05.424 --> 05:06.240
I...

05:07.046 --> 05:08.586
thought you were Katie.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.192
Shit, shit, shit, girl.

06:45.018 --> 06:47.120
- That's secret!
- Fuck off, worm.

06:47.447 --> 06:48.880
Dinner's ready, bitch!

06:49.433 --> 06:50.326
Excuse me?

06:50.446 --> 06:53.926
Gordon MacPherson says "bitch"
all the time. Now I say it too.

06:54.075 --> 06:56.330
- You don't say it to me, OK?
- OK, sorry.

06:56.450 --> 06:59.516
What's in the box, James?
I know you know the combination.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.453
I don't, Emily changed it after I...

07:01.573 --> 07:02.731
After you what?

07:03.520 --> 07:04.520
Nothing.

07:06.450 --> 07:08.370
What's in the box, James?

07:08.561 --> 07:09.675
It's a secret.

07:10.455 --> 07:11.440
I'm waiting.

07:15.514 --> 07:17.860
Fannies! It's full of fannies!

07:31.814 --> 07:32.836
You OK?

07:35.961 --> 07:37.229
What about your mum?

07:37.768 --> 07:39.150
This is my room.

07:39.270 --> 07:40.867
No-one's allowed in here.

07:43.441 --> 07:45.604
I wish I had a room like that.

07:45.724 --> 07:46.874
Katie and me,

07:47.664 --> 07:49.232
we're always together.

07:49.352 --> 07:50.817
Everything together.

07:51.374 --> 07:53.374
Eating, sleeping...

07:54.356 --> 07:57.483
Until we were nine we used to take
a dump at the same time.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.449
No secrets, there's no point.

08:04.411 --> 08:06.119
And what about this one?

08:16.985 --> 08:18.453
I want to tell people.

08:19.766 --> 08:20.968
That you're gay?

08:22.048 --> 08:23.929
I want to tell people about us.

08:29.985 --> 08:31.984
Come to the college ball with me.

08:32.317 --> 08:33.922
Like we're... together.

08:34.924 --> 08:36.559
I don't want to do that.

08:36.946 --> 08:37.946
Why not?

08:40.802 --> 08:42.371
Em, it's nobody's business.

08:42.491 --> 08:44.810
Why? Who cares what other people...

08:46.117 --> 08:47.828
I'm not like you.

08:50.305 --> 08:52.323
I'm not sure, like you are.

08:53.342 --> 08:54.892
What aren't you sure of?

08:56.199 --> 08:57.680
Can't things ever be complicated?

08:57.928 --> 09:00.200
Fine. You like boys too?

09:00.866 --> 09:01.866
Maybe.

09:03.192 --> 09:05.483
Maybe I only like boys,
apart from you.

09:07.056 --> 09:08.616
Well, that's fucking great!

09:08.736 --> 09:10.560
You're so in touch with yourself,
aren't you?

09:14.686 --> 09:16.436
Come to the ball with me.

09:26.457 --> 09:27.543
Don't do that.

09:28.411 --> 09:29.850
You don't do that.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.078
I'm not your fucking experiment!

09:35.181 --> 09:36.862
Where are my fucking...?

09:37.614 --> 09:39.304
Oh, my fucking shoes!

09:40.802 --> 09:42.454
Oh, fuck it! Keep them.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.285
I'm tired.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.806
So sick and tired of it.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.640
Still holding hands through
a cat flap, aren't we?

10:02.076 --> 10:03.503
Have fun in Cyprus.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.520
- Where are your shoes?
- They...

10:40.452 --> 10:41.879
I couldn't find them.

10:45.116 --> 10:47.280
- You can wear mine.
- No, you don't need to.

10:47.942 --> 10:48.942
It's OK.

10:53.343 --> 10:56.080
I don't mind bare feet.
It's easier to run.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.160
- Here. Let me give you a jacket.
- No, really, Thomas...

11:04.321 --> 11:06.680
It's fine. I have three coats. See?

11:17.480 --> 11:19.040
Now, all fixed up, yes?

11:25.379 --> 11:28.102
What do you do if someone
you love lets you down?

11:29.253 --> 11:30.735
Really fucks you over?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.440
You must try to stop loving them.

11:37.810 --> 11:39.119
Is that possible?

11:44.840 --> 11:46.091
I don't think so.

11:53.357 --> 11:54.679
I'm gay, Thomas.

11:57.528 --> 11:58.360
It's fine.

11:59.570 --> 12:02.592
Shall we call a taxi? I don't think
this bus is going to come soon.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.920
Besides, my feet are extremely cold.

12:16.698 --> 12:17.893
It's pathetic.

12:18.013 --> 12:21.474
This guy can hardly do ten reps
on a bench press

12:21.594 --> 12:24.320
without retching like a baby.
Eventually I had to say to him,

12:24.481 --> 12:28.468
"Ken, if you puke one more time
in my gym,

12:28.641 --> 12:32.359
"it won't be your heart you'll have to
worry about cos I'll kill you meself!"

12:33.138 --> 12:36.479
That's great, Rob. I'm sure
he'll appreciate it... eventually.

12:36.893 --> 12:39.479
Too right. No pain, no drain,

12:39.640 --> 12:41.184
no gain, yeah? Yeah?

12:42.018 --> 12:43.335
I'm sure that's right.

12:43.455 --> 12:47.384
You don't get your gluts
and your pecs taut without reps, reps.

12:47.504 --> 12:49.134
I'm always saying that.

12:49.480 --> 12:50.842
Yes, you are.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.424
Great soup. What is it?

12:54.819 --> 12:56.138
Artichoke and beetroot.

12:56.258 --> 12:59.500
Babe, you're the best.
You feed us like champions.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.920
It won't make you fit,
it'll make you what, Katiekins?

13:05.673 --> 13:08.227
Don't get fit, get Fitch, right?

13:09.200 --> 13:12.600
I want fish and chips.
This tastes like bollocky wankshite.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.894
What? They say bollocky wankshite all
the time at Gordon MacPherson's house.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.594
Mrs MacPherson says

13:19.714 --> 13:22.440
as long as swearing is used in context,
it's fucking A.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.119
That's ten reps on the naughty bar.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.599
Why, why?

13:27.763 --> 13:31.144
We're not MacPherson, we're Fitch.
Do it. Go!

13:32.653 --> 13:34.080
It's just not fair.

13:34.488 --> 13:36.485
And proper extension, boy.

13:38.452 --> 13:39.452
One.

13:41.205 --> 13:42.205
Two.

13:42.893 --> 13:44.034
Three.

13:44.381 --> 13:47.080
Come on, kid. Put some burn into it!

13:47.528 --> 13:48.528
Four.

13:49.589 --> 13:50.589
Five...

13:50.961 --> 13:52.999
- Emily, is that you, darling?
- Six.

13:53.473 --> 13:55.040
Dinner's getting cold.

13:59.895 --> 14:02.520
Get up, kid. You can do
the last four reps before bed.

14:06.315 --> 14:08.040
- You smell.
- Shut up.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.840
What have you been doing?

14:10.585 --> 14:11.585
Nothing.

14:12.401 --> 14:15.391
- You look like you've been fighting.
- Well, I haven't.

14:16.717 --> 14:17.960
Look, leave me alone.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.910
Is it a boy that's upset you?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.880
Mum, I don't think
she wants to talk about it.

14:26.041 --> 14:27.041
I do.

14:27.402 --> 14:29.080
Cos if it's been a boy
that's been...

14:30.530 --> 14:33.592
You look like you've been
roughed up, so tell me.

14:35.029 --> 14:36.680
- It wasn't a boy.
- See? So...

14:36.847 --> 14:37.822
It was a girl.

14:37.942 --> 14:41.320
You've been fighting with a girl?
That's not very ladylike.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.751
No, Dad.
I've been making love to a girl.

14:47.842 --> 14:49.342
Everybody satisfied?

14:52.920 --> 14:54.294
You're such a liar.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.100
- Don't listen to her.
- Her name's Naomi.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.727
She's rather beautiful.

14:59.871 --> 15:01.833
- So I was nailing her.
- Sorry?

15:08.635 --> 15:12.230
I get it. Nice one.
Had me going there!

15:12.350 --> 15:16.284
I've got to mind my own business.
Funny, very nice.

15:16.563 --> 15:18.150
Very nice!

15:18.781 --> 15:20.793
You've got to give it to her!
Convincing!

15:20.913 --> 15:22.760
- Dad. I'm trying to tell you...
- Shut up!

15:22.920 --> 15:26.425
I've got Mambo Badminton at nine.
High calorie burn.

15:26.918 --> 15:28.664
I love those moves.

15:30.279 --> 15:32.815
"Nailing her..." You're funny!

15:45.324 --> 15:47.321
Gordon MacPherson says
you call them dykes,

15:47.446 --> 15:49.876
because you have
to stick your finger in them.

16:03.662 --> 16:05.223
You ruined my fucking top.

16:05.348 --> 16:08.213
I sat your exam for you.
You could've at least backed me up.

16:08.338 --> 16:09.636
I did back you up!

16:09.804 --> 16:12.595
I just spent an hour downstairs trying
to convince Mum that you made it all up.

16:12.764 --> 16:13.919
That's fucking great.

16:14.044 --> 16:15.309
Because you have!

16:15.694 --> 16:16.514
What?

16:16.634 --> 16:19.487
You've conjured up this thing
with Naomi because... I don't know,

16:19.612 --> 16:21.347
maybe you're jealous of me.

16:22.397 --> 16:25.431
- Jealous?
- Yes, because I get more boys than you,

16:25.551 --> 16:27.915
I look better in clothes than you
and I'm more popular than you.

16:28.084 --> 16:29.335
- Fuck off.
- I think so.

16:29.460 --> 16:31.410
You can't stand it, it's sad.

16:32.477 --> 16:34.759
So are you gonna stop now
before you hurt everybody?

16:35.640 --> 16:37.890
You're not gay. You're just stupid.

16:38.015 --> 16:41.618
Right, I'm stupid. I'm stupid
because I don't let anyone fuck me

16:41.743 --> 16:43.555
when they're in love
with somebody else?

16:44.353 --> 16:46.596
You let Freddie use you
and look where it's got you.

16:46.933 --> 16:49.955
That's a normal relationship, isn't it?
She fucked you up good, didn't she?

16:50.080 --> 16:52.870
Nobody hits me over the head
with a rock. Loser.

17:14.488 --> 17:15.538
Look at me!

17:18.646 --> 17:19.946
I'm still Emily.

18:20.804 --> 18:21.676
Sorry.

18:21.844 --> 18:23.996
That's OK. I'm always in a rush.

18:25.911 --> 18:29.586
- I'm sorry, I don't think we've...
- Naomi, I'm a friend of Emily's.

18:34.256 --> 18:36.076
- Come in.
- I thought you were in...

18:36.201 --> 18:38.436
No, really, it's fine.
They're all still in bed.

18:38.795 --> 18:39.795
Come in.

18:41.383 --> 18:42.483
I should go.

18:42.893 --> 18:43.893
Please.

18:46.096 --> 18:47.550
Sit down. Please.

18:56.668 --> 18:59.068
- I just...
- Emily's impressionable.

19:04.688 --> 19:06.338
She's the younger twin.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.082
Right.

19:08.207 --> 19:11.290
And that means that somehow
she's always in her sister's shadow.

19:11.415 --> 19:13.605
I don't know why that is, but it is.

19:13.730 --> 19:15.480
Katie's always in charge.

19:15.870 --> 19:18.758
And I think Emily wants to,
I don't know,

19:19.844 --> 19:21.984
do something to feel that she's...

19:22.109 --> 19:24.195
I don't know
what we're talking about here.

19:24.638 --> 19:25.924
Yes, you do.

19:31.161 --> 19:34.436
So I want you to stop
putting ideas into her head.

19:36.544 --> 19:38.076
She's not gay.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.750
- I'm not gay.
- Right,

19:39.875 --> 19:42.875
so there's nothing
to worry about then, is there?

19:44.954 --> 19:47.754
Because they're the apple
of their dad's eye.

19:47.879 --> 19:50.329
He loves them, like,
fierce, you know?

19:51.016 --> 19:53.522
Just the way they are.
Normal, happy twins,

19:53.647 --> 19:55.599
and they're more alike
than you'll ever know.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.236
Are you sure of that?

19:57.747 --> 19:59.997
I want you to disappear now, Naomi.

20:01.354 --> 20:03.876
Don't screw her up, OK?

20:06.086 --> 20:07.727
Goodbye, Naomi.

20:45.317 --> 20:47.067
Why are you talking Twin?

20:47.192 --> 20:48.748
We don't do that any more.

21:01.444 --> 21:03.144
Are you getting dressed?

21:07.176 --> 21:08.477
Are you going out?

21:10.240 --> 21:12.290
I'm sick of this fucking house.

21:12.625 --> 21:14.275
I'm sick of being sick.

21:15.051 --> 21:16.618
Where are you going?

21:17.438 --> 21:19.738
- We're going shopping.
- For what?

21:19.867 --> 21:22.156
- For Love Ball dresses.
- We don't have dates.

21:22.578 --> 21:23.756
So we'll go together.

21:24.930 --> 21:27.382
- I don't want to.
- We're going together!

21:33.388 --> 21:35.076
Please, I need you, OK?

21:37.444 --> 21:39.072
- I want my packed lunch.
- Shit.

21:39.197 --> 21:40.395
You're naked, bitch.

21:46.637 --> 21:47.637
Sorry!

22:08.959 --> 22:11.409
- How you feeling?
- Yeah, I'm better.

22:11.534 --> 22:13.701
You're feeling better? That's great.

22:13.826 --> 22:15.433
Have you heard from Effy?

22:18.716 --> 22:21.806
- I'm sure she didn't mean...
- I think she meant it, don't you?

22:22.949 --> 22:25.599
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault, Panda.

22:26.732 --> 22:29.007
- What are you doing?
- I bought this dress for the Love Ball

22:29.132 --> 22:32.486
in case Thomas forgave me.
Anyway, I'm taking it back.

22:33.055 --> 22:36.611
We haven't got anyone to go with
but we're still going. Right, Ems?

22:37.223 --> 22:38.523
Yeah, I suppose.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.833
So keep your dress and we'll go
together, OK? Just the girls, right?

22:41.958 --> 22:43.206
You mean, like, go girls?

22:44.086 --> 22:46.286
Yeah, go girls. Right. You got it.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.604
OK, go girls.

22:48.366 --> 22:49.366
Whizzer.

22:51.427 --> 22:52.677
See you, Panda.

22:53.406 --> 22:56.114
I'm never doing surf and turf
with boys ever again.

22:56.239 --> 22:58.487
It just fucks everything up,
don't it?

23:04.082 --> 23:05.132
Let's shop.

23:37.299 --> 23:38.010
Shit.

23:39.401 --> 23:41.424
What the fuck is he doing here?

23:42.275 --> 23:45.406
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah... No... I don't know.

23:46.448 --> 23:47.486
Come on, let's go.

23:49.605 --> 23:53.111
- Christ, is he coming over?
- No, he's not that stupid.

23:58.526 --> 23:59.526
Oh, fuck.

24:10.924 --> 24:12.793
- What do you want?
- Nothing,

24:13.510 --> 24:17.166
- I just wanted to see how you are.
- Now you want to see how I am.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.283
Thanks, that's well compassionate.

24:20.479 --> 24:21.479
Cheers.

24:27.097 --> 24:28.812
I didn't know what to say.

24:28.937 --> 24:30.483
- I fucked up.
- No, Freddie.

24:30.608 --> 24:33.808
You fucked Effy
when you were meant to be fucking me.

24:34.102 --> 24:36.086
Oh, yeah, after she hit me
with a rock!

24:38.933 --> 24:39.933
Right.

24:43.764 --> 24:45.231
I'm trying on dresses.

24:51.754 --> 24:54.646
So, mum bought me
my first man suit for the Love Ball.

24:55.125 --> 24:57.494
65% polyester, 35% viscose.

24:57.619 --> 25:00.425
It is a bit crackly and I don't like
the way the cat rubs against me...

25:00.550 --> 25:01.545
Shut up.

25:01.670 --> 25:04.098
I needed a tie...
And I'm winding up.

25:04.681 --> 25:07.348
Freddie brought me here and...
I've stopped,

25:08.089 --> 25:09.639
but still uncomfortable.

25:11.830 --> 25:13.850
Do I really have to tell you
what to do now?

25:32.280 --> 25:34.607
You didn't tell anyone
about me and you, did you, JJ?

25:34.732 --> 25:36.752
- No. Of course not.
- Because that's a secret.

25:37.436 --> 25:40.712
Yep. Schtum. Need-to-know basis.
Zipped it. Total, total secret.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.124
I told Freddie.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.472
It's fine, he doesn't even mind
that you're gay either.

25:49.856 --> 25:52.474
Come on. Let's get you
a fucking tie.

25:57.397 --> 25:59.711
Can't you see
I just want to make things right?

26:00.624 --> 26:01.624
You can't.

26:02.577 --> 26:05.063
- Look at the state of me.
- What can I do?

26:05.975 --> 26:07.375
You humiliated me.

26:08.061 --> 26:09.356
Effy doesn't even want you.

26:12.436 --> 26:15.238
No, cos otherwise she'd be here
and not with Cook.

26:20.636 --> 26:24.072
There's nothing I can do to make
you want me more than her, is there?

26:31.707 --> 26:33.057
Katie, I'm sorry.

26:34.162 --> 26:36.916
But you fucking owe me, Freddie.
You owe me!

26:40.280 --> 26:43.912
You'll take me to that ball and everyone
will see you looking like you like it.

26:44.224 --> 26:46.724
Right, but I told JJ I'd go with him.
He's a bit shy.

26:46.849 --> 26:48.249
He's taking Emily.

26:49.449 --> 26:51.438
- He'd like that.
- I don't care if he'd like that.

26:51.563 --> 26:52.763
He's doing it.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.516
I suppose after they had
their thing...

26:56.692 --> 26:58.518
He was very animated, you know.

26:58.638 --> 27:01.512
- Sorry?
- You know, when they got it on.

27:01.755 --> 27:04.155
I told him
he was a lucky, lucky boy.

27:05.836 --> 27:06.836
Right.

27:08.382 --> 27:09.952
Yeah, she said he was cute.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.403
Cute? He was fucking ecstatic.

27:13.770 --> 27:15.272
But that's a secret, yeah?

27:17.694 --> 27:19.752
Yeah, she tells me everything.

27:20.281 --> 27:21.281
I figured.

27:23.501 --> 27:25.876
- I told you there was a guy in here.
- Excuse me, I'm changing!

27:26.280 --> 27:28.279
- You've got to come with me.
- That's disgusting.

27:28.404 --> 27:30.162
They probably pinched stuff.

27:30.287 --> 27:32.950
- Yeah, I've gotta frisk you.
- Go frisk yourself.

27:33.075 --> 27:35.868
- I've got a situation here, Samantha.
- Get names, Trevor.

27:42.569 --> 27:45.083
How did something like that
just happen?

27:45.489 --> 27:47.592
He wanted a rumble and so did I.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.740
That's not a rumble.

27:51.096 --> 27:54.137
That's insanity spelled G-E-E-K!

27:55.332 --> 27:57.228
You're such a secretive little cow.

27:57.353 --> 27:59.772
What the fuck?
Can't I sleep with someone now?

27:59.897 --> 28:02.352
That's not someone, he's a mong.

28:03.923 --> 28:06.769
I feel like having sex with him.
I don't have to ask you.

28:06.894 --> 28:07.994
Yes, you do!

28:08.833 --> 28:10.833
- What?
- You have to ask me.

28:16.892 --> 28:18.432
Not gay, stupid!

28:52.192 --> 28:54.203
Please don't be horrible to Katie.

28:54.990 --> 28:56.779
She's a bitch, Mum.

28:56.904 --> 28:59.819
She's been hurt.
You've got to remember that.

29:00.278 --> 29:01.328
Please, Em.

29:02.011 --> 29:03.911
No-one's hurt you like that.

29:49.458 --> 29:52.072
Excuse me! Where are you going?

30:15.039 --> 30:16.889
- <i>What?</i>
- Please, Emily.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.752
- I have to speak to you.
- <i>What for?</i>

30:20.156 --> 30:21.356
Don't hang up.

30:23.487 --> 30:24.487
<i>Fine,</i>

30:24.612 --> 30:26.335
<i>you can meet me for coffee.</i>

30:55.031 --> 30:56.399
You gonna sit down?

31:07.583 --> 31:09.446
Was that you on the phone?

31:09.636 --> 31:11.757
She shouldn't leave it lying around.

31:15.055 --> 31:16.055
So?

31:16.460 --> 31:18.853
Leave her alone, she's mine.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.044
She can't help what she is.

31:25.013 --> 31:26.171
Neither can I.

31:27.246 --> 31:30.157
Seemed like she could help it
when she was fucking JJ.

31:33.041 --> 31:35.386
- What?
- Apparently he's quite keen, actually.

31:35.506 --> 31:38.116
After she saw to him
good and proper.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.130
It's not true.

31:41.406 --> 31:42.479
You hurt her,

31:43.523 --> 31:45.326
and now she doesn't want you.

31:52.692 --> 31:54.486
Why are you so horrible?

31:54.606 --> 31:57.235
Because I love her
more than you ever can.

31:57.591 --> 32:00.676
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got dresses to buy for a ball.

32:01.104 --> 32:02.548
You won't be there,

32:03.133 --> 32:04.560
because if you are...

32:35.585 --> 32:36.964
Pleased to meet you.

32:39.586 --> 32:42.092
What are you stressing about?
It's tradition.

32:42.212 --> 32:44.824
Parents just want to know
their little girls are in safe hands.

32:44.944 --> 32:45.977
They'll know

32:46.889 --> 32:48.205
where these hands have been.

32:48.325 --> 32:50.693
They're not gonna know
you had sex with Emily.

32:50.813 --> 32:52.316
My mum knew straightaway.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.420
It was written all over my face.

33:01.353 --> 33:03.038
The young men have arrived.

33:07.883 --> 33:10.807
They're getting ready.
You know how girls are.

33:11.700 --> 33:15.127
They're not still virgins tomorrow,
I'll hunt you down like dogs.

33:20.958 --> 33:22.382
Come on, they're here.

33:22.685 --> 33:23.917
I don't want to.

33:24.943 --> 33:27.088
I said Katie schum, OK?

33:27.298 --> 33:29.286
I was surprised, that's all.

33:31.585 --> 33:33.262
Did she ring you again?

33:35.907 --> 33:38.276
Cos she doesn't want
to go with you and I do.

33:38.396 --> 33:40.884
So just put the dress
on and let's go out.

33:44.761 --> 33:47.435
- Don't touch that.
- I know what's in here, Ems.

33:48.406 --> 33:49.406
Please.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.756
Give it back.

33:51.132 --> 33:54.154
It's a box of fannies,
is it making you happy?

33:57.684 --> 33:59.040
So put it away.

34:05.980 --> 34:07.836
Please can we go to the ball now?

34:10.574 --> 34:12.495
They're taking a long time.

34:13.922 --> 34:16.804
It's a chance to get to know you,
isn't that nice?

34:22.637 --> 34:26.168
So, tell me JJ,
do you know Emily well?

34:28.466 --> 34:29.616
Pretty well.

34:30.179 --> 34:31.793
She hasn't mentioned you.

34:33.534 --> 34:34.886
A bit of a secret, you know.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.795
- Really?
- JJ's a bit shy.

34:37.161 --> 34:39.156
I can see that.
It's written all over your face.

34:39.510 --> 34:40.835
No, it's not.

34:41.257 --> 34:44.716
I didn't... Well, I did...
Pyjamas and she made me do it.

34:45.723 --> 34:48.321
Yes, but it was all totally safe,
so don't worry.

34:50.824 --> 34:51.824
Right.

34:58.284 --> 34:59.384
We're ready.

35:52.421 --> 35:53.769
Welcome to the Love Ball.

35:53.889 --> 35:56.186
- Nice suit.
- Have a good time.

35:58.137 --> 36:00.947
Pandora! Step this way.

36:03.700 --> 36:07.046
I must say, Pandora,
you are a vision.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.186
Thanks, Doug!

36:08.306 --> 36:10.876
- Where is your beau?
- Here, silly.

36:10.996 --> 36:12.647
No, your...

36:13.497 --> 36:15.386
beau, your boyfriend.

36:15.700 --> 36:16.700
Your escort.

36:16.972 --> 36:19.212
No, I tried escorting,
I didn't like it.

36:20.146 --> 36:21.996
So I'm getting myself to a nunnery.

36:22.512 --> 36:24.266
You know, no boys, no way, no how.

36:24.679 --> 36:27.185
- They're idiots. I've had it.
- Oh, dear.

36:27.736 --> 36:31.442
In that case, would you allow me
the honour of a dance?

36:32.221 --> 36:34.746
Let's get this party started,
shall we?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.360
Great. Cos I'm a wicked dancer.

36:38.046 --> 36:40.039
You're in the hands of a master.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.870
Jesus, what is this stuff?

37:07.990 --> 37:10.123
It's Dad's potato moonshine.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.870
He went
on a "distil anything" course.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.688
Use it for weedkiller, mainly.

37:17.218 --> 37:18.433
What's it like?

37:23.561 --> 37:25.460
Katie, this is too weird.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.610
This just...
this feels a bit weird, you know?

37:28.730 --> 37:30.560
I know.
We have to do it, though, right?

37:31.290 --> 37:32.710
We're just on a date.

37:32.830 --> 37:35.640
We're just on a date.
No... shagging.

37:39.810 --> 37:42.359
I'd quite like to, you know?
If... she'd let me.

37:42.521 --> 37:45.680
- As long as I don't have to shag him.
- No-one's shagging, we're just gonna...

37:46.015 --> 37:48.004
Chill out. That's it, OK?

37:50.960 --> 37:52.150
Give me that.

37:52.714 --> 37:55.441
Hang on, JJ, no, you don't... drink.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.680
Right. Let's do this.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.390
Go, girls. All right?

38:10.800 --> 38:11.800
Ladies.

38:12.311 --> 38:13.907
Welcome to the Love Ball.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.039
Yes, love is all around, hopefully.

38:17.159 --> 38:18.159
And...

38:29.155 --> 38:30.155
How sweet.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.690
Out on a foursome.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.959
Look at you, JJ. Suave!

38:36.590 --> 38:38.152
Well, it should be fun.

38:38.438 --> 38:40.700
Emily's great in the sack,
isn't she, JJ?

38:43.711 --> 38:45.920
I mean... Wait, I mean... but...

38:47.624 --> 38:48.360
Bobbins.

38:52.762 --> 38:54.759
- I wanted to tell you...
- Yeah?

38:55.928 --> 38:58.042
But you didn't, did you, hon?

39:01.481 --> 39:03.081
If you'll excuse me...

39:14.193 --> 39:15.193
Right.

39:25.090 --> 39:27.292
Definitely not
shagging tonight, then.

39:32.026 --> 39:33.026
Come on.

39:33.488 --> 39:36.014
They're girls.
They always kiss and make up.

39:39.853 --> 39:41.257
Fuck off!

39:44.216 --> 39:46.200
You're a mad fucking cow,
aren't you, Katie?

39:46.320 --> 39:48.000
You're so fucking right.

39:48.300 --> 39:51.010
- That's for fucking her up.
- But that wasn't me.

39:51.130 --> 39:53.480
She's my sister! You're just a slut.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.960
- Takes one to know one, doesn't it?
- Oh, go fuck yourself.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.160
Didn't need to blab about JJ!

39:58.280 --> 40:00.220
You just loved doing it,
didn't you, Katiekins?

40:00.340 --> 40:01.850
She deserved it.

40:01.970 --> 40:03.640
What did I deserve, Katie?

40:10.476 --> 40:12.193
It wasn't like that!

40:13.571 --> 40:15.421
Emily, please don't walk away.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.057
You fucking cow!

40:20.259 --> 40:21.259
Get off!

40:22.386 --> 40:23.589
Get off me!

40:33.560 --> 40:34.560
Excuse me.

40:35.287 --> 40:36.287
Mavis.

40:36.798 --> 40:38.459
- Do me a favour.
- What?

40:39.191 --> 40:41.600
Bugger off, would you,
there's a good girl.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.480
- Harriet, are you all right?
- No, Doug.

40:46.784 --> 40:50.372
There's a couple of things
I need to go over with you.

40:53.580 --> 40:55.100
I just want to say...

40:56.932 --> 40:58.640
I just want to say...

41:10.120 --> 41:12.040
That's ridiculous ladies.

41:15.251 --> 41:16.040
Get off!

41:51.494 --> 41:53.032
I can't stand this.

41:54.698 --> 41:55.934
I'm a person.

41:58.079 --> 41:59.333
I'm not you.

42:04.390 --> 42:05.390
I know.

42:30.610 --> 42:32.433
You have to understand, Katie.

42:33.285 --> 42:34.515
I love you.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.667
And I'll never really leave you.

42:37.632 --> 42:39.379
But I can't fix this.

42:40.727 --> 42:42.056
I like girls.

42:44.581 --> 42:45.872
I like a girl.

42:50.695 --> 42:51.884
I love her.

42:58.790 --> 42:59.800
I love...

43:02.306 --> 43:03.306
her.

44:03.315 --> 44:04.315
Please.

44:05.242 --> 44:06.692
Can we start again?

44:07.521 --> 44:09.590
I promise. I promise...

44:10.921 --> 44:11.840
I'm Thomas.

44:14.075 --> 44:15.518
So glad to meet you.

44:24.607 --> 44:25.822
Some party.

44:26.503 --> 44:27.503
Eventful.

44:30.509 --> 44:31.686
I love you too.

44:32.839 --> 44:33.839
I know.

44:34.305 --> 44:40.201
