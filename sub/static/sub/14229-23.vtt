It's finally here.
Your new royal sailboat.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.830
I love it. And the weather's
perfect to go sailing.

01:17.830 --> 01:20.920
-I have a better idea.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.250
Let's summon
my best friends.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.790
Well, not summon them,
more like invite them over.

01:25.790 --> 01:28.420
I'll send out the invitations
right away, Your Highness.

01:28.420 --> 01:29.880
And I'll get
the boat ready.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.500
Hm, let me see...

01:32.500 --> 01:36.250
Princess Elena would like
her best friend

01:36.250 --> 01:39.170
to join her for a day of sailing

01:39.170 --> 01:42.880
on the new royal sailboat.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.920
!
!

01:45.920 --> 01:47.960
There's a new royal sailboat?!

01:49.920 --> 01:52.500
Elena!
-Gabe!

01:52.500 --> 01:55.880
-You made it!
-Of course I did.
Anything for my best friend.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.460
Best friend Mateo,
reporting for duty!

01:58.460 --> 02:00.080
What are you doing here?

02:00.080 --> 02:02.000
I was going to ask you
the same question.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.830
Ahoy, mateys!

02:03.830 --> 02:07.000
Is that your mom's
captain's hat?

02:07.000 --> 02:10.880
-Maybe.
-Then maybe "Captain Naomi"
should take the helm.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.670
I thought you'd never ask.

02:12.670 --> 02:14.920
Cast off the lines
and ready the sails, men!

02:14.920 --> 02:16.750
Look sharp!

02:16.750 --> 02:18.080
-Now!

02:26.710 --> 02:29.000
It was nice of Elena
to invite you guys, too.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.540
What do you mean "too"?

02:30.540 --> 02:32.380
Well, you know,
my invite said

02:32.380 --> 02:34.170
she wanted her best friend
to go sailing with her.

02:34.170 --> 02:36.580
Well, you know,
so did mine.

02:36.580 --> 02:39.540
Well, she can only
have one best friend.

02:39.540 --> 02:43.880
-And you're looking at him.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.040
I guess
we'll see about that.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.920
Elena, let me help you!

02:48.920 --> 02:50.920
Oh, thanks, Gabe!

02:50.920 --> 02:53.710
What are best friends for?

02:54.710 --> 02:55.920
Perfect.

02:57.750 --> 03:00.040
Hey, Elena. I've been
working on a new spell.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.790
-Uh, sure, Mateo.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.000
Cachoa!

03:05.460 --> 03:09.290
Whoa!

03:09.290 --> 03:10.830
-Ah!
-Whoa!

03:13.210 --> 03:16.710
Whoa! What a ride!

03:16.710 --> 03:19.920
-Thanks, Mateo.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.620
Whoa!

03:22.620 --> 03:24.040
Whoa!

03:27.380 --> 03:30.040
-Uh, okay!

03:30.040 --> 03:33.460
!
-Of course. Whoa!

03:33.460 --> 03:35.380
Whoa!

03:36.420 --> 03:37.420
Zanamo!

03:41.080 --> 03:43.210
Ah! Oof!

03:43.210 --> 03:45.920
Whew! Okay, it's all good.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.670
No, it isn't.
Part of the rudder broke.

03:48.670 --> 03:51.960
-Only if you want
to steer the boat.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.580
-Nice job, Mateo.
-It'll be fine.

03:54.580 --> 03:57.040
All we have to do is pull it up
and patch it back together.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.170
I think there's
a toolbox below deck.

03:59.170 --> 04:02.000
Great. You grab the tools,
I'll pull up the rudder.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
No, wait! You have
to tie a rope around it and...

04:04.000 --> 04:06.290
No!

04:06.290 --> 04:08.080
...secure it first.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.880
Well, no need for the toolbox.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.920
-We can't fix it now.
-Nice job, Gabe.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.540
So how are we going
to get home?

04:14.540 --> 04:17.120
Don't worry, Elena.
I'll signal for help.

04:17.120 --> 04:17.880
Latopo!

04:20.120 --> 04:21.460
You think anyone saw it?

04:21.460 --> 04:23.210
Well, it's too late now.

04:25.170 --> 04:27.210
That fog
sure rolled in fast.

04:27.210 --> 04:29.040
-Shh. Listen.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.290
It sounds like
some kind of party.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.080
-Help!
-Over here!

04:35.080 --> 04:37.540
-Help!
-Hey, mon!

04:37.540 --> 04:40.170
What troubles ya
"dis" fine day?

04:40.170 --> 04:42.540
-We lost our rudder.
-Oh, that's a shame!

04:42.540 --> 04:45.830
But don't you worry! We have
plenty of rudders in our hold.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.960
One a "dem" should be small
enough for your skiff.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.290
Come aboard,
and I'll grab ya one.

04:52.290 --> 04:56.170
Thank you! We really
appreciate your generosity.

04:56.170 --> 04:59.040
We seafarers
stick together forever.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.710
Isn't that right, Captain?

05:03.120 --> 05:05.460
That's right.

05:05.460 --> 05:10.120
After you, Elena.
-Uh, thanks, guys.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.710
-Hey!
-Watch it!

05:12.710 --> 05:15.000
I am Captain Chiloya,

05:15.000 --> 05:16.920
and this is me
first mate, Bijoux.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.120
Ha-ha! Welcome
aboard the Alegria.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.380
I'm Elena,
and these are my friends,

05:22.380 --> 05:24.120
Gabe, Mateo, and Naomi.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.210
Is this an Iber

05:26.210 --> 05:29.380
Ah! Ya know
your ships, Captain.

05:29.380 --> 05:32.080
Whoa! It's gotta be
at least a hundred years old,

05:32.080 --> 05:33.580
but it looks brand-new.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.460
Restoring it must've
been a lot of work.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.380
It's easier than you think.

05:38.380 --> 05:42.670
Men, tie up their boat
while I show our guests around.

05:45.290 --> 05:47.460
I'll move that crate
for you, Elena.

05:47.460 --> 05:51.750
-Thanks, Gabe.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.080
-This here's me crew!

05:54.080 --> 05:56.710
Ahoy!
-Looks like a party.

05:56.710 --> 06:00.170
That's because it is.
Today is our Lanzario,

06:00.170 --> 06:03.170
the anniversary
of our ship's first launch.

06:03.170 --> 06:07.040
It feels like our first Lanzario
was only yesterday,

06:07.040 --> 06:09.250
-That it does.

06:09.250 --> 06:12.290
Time flies when you're
havin' fun, don't it?

06:12.290 --> 06:15.120
Are they playing trompo?
I love that game.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.960
Oh! But you haven't seen
tops like these before.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.880
Every time you knock someone
else's top out of the ring,

06:21.880 --> 06:24.290
yours gets bigger.

06:24.290 --> 06:27.210
-That's right.

06:27.210 --> 06:29.120
All our games are!

06:32.170 --> 06:34.330
Our captain is the best, huh?

06:34.330 --> 06:38.790
Correct, you are!

06:38.790 --> 06:41.210
Like a pirate!

06:41.210 --> 06:43.290
-Come on, mon!

06:43.290 --> 06:46.210
-Join us in the next game.
-Uh, we'd love to.

06:46.210 --> 06:49.250
And while ya do that,
I'll go see about that rudder.

06:49.250 --> 06:52.210
-Be back in a tick.

06:52.210 --> 06:55.290
-I'll give it a spin.
-Elena, you should go first.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.460
No, I'll go after Naomi.

06:56.460 --> 06:59.540
-Here you go.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.250
Uh, what's up with you two?

07:01.250 --> 07:02.670
Nothing.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.170
-Yes!
-If you think that's fun,
check this out!

07:09.170 --> 07:11.290
This game is called Flotador.

07:11.290 --> 07:14.210
Toss the magical ring
over a flying buoy,

07:14.210 --> 07:17.460
and the first person
to do so wins.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.330
This is harder than it looks.

07:24.330 --> 07:27.290
-I'm helping you.

07:27.290 --> 07:29.500
-But I don't need your help.
-Yeah, Mateo.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.670
She doesn't need you.
She needs me.

07:31.670 --> 07:33.330
Gabe!

07:37.380 --> 07:39.290
Guys, what are you doing?

07:39.290 --> 07:41.330
Yes! Elena won!

07:41.330 --> 07:43.500
-You mean, you won.
-Okay...

07:43.500 --> 07:47.120
As much fun as... whatever
this is you guys are doing,

07:47.120 --> 07:48.580
I'm going to go check
on the rudder.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.460
And then he told Mr. Flounder

07:55.460 --> 07:58.290
that he was off the hook!

08:01.380 --> 08:04.250
Captain Chiloya,
any luck finding the rudder?

08:04.250 --> 08:07.000
The rudder?
It's where it always is.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.830
Helping to steer the ship.

08:09.830 --> 08:11.420
Oh, you mean your rudder.

08:11.420 --> 08:13.620
Right. Back in a tick!

08:13.620 --> 08:16.500
I'm starting to wonder
what "a tick" really means.

08:16.500 --> 08:20.290
I better go make sure he doesn't
get distracted... again.

08:33.290 --> 08:35.420
Huh... where did he go?

08:41.790 --> 08:44.420
So much for looking
for the rudder.

08:45.830 --> 08:48.040
Come dance with us
old barnacles!

08:48.040 --> 08:50.120
We're having a bit
of a knees-up!

08:50.120 --> 08:52.750
-Get over here, blondie!

08:52.750 --> 08:55.380
That's okay.
I'm not really a good dancer.

08:55.380 --> 08:59.330
Don't you worry. I can take care
of dat wit a dancing spell.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.290
Dancing spell?

09:01.290 --> 09:03.420
-Purun!
-Oh!

09:03.420 --> 09:06.670
Whoa! Ah! Oh!

09:06.670 --> 09:09.170
Hey! Oh! Whoa!

09:09.170 --> 09:12.330
Hey, Elena, which game
do you want to play next?

09:12.330 --> 09:14.290
I think we've played
enough games.

09:14.290 --> 09:16.620
Maybe we should go find Naomi.
She's been gone a while.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.330
-I'm on it.
-Uh, me, too.

09:18.330 --> 09:22.380
But... I meant all of us.

09:22.380 --> 09:25.380
What is going on
with those guys?

09:27.670 --> 09:29.290
Naomi!

09:31.750 --> 09:33.790
Naomi

09:34.790 --> 09:36.290
Oh!

09:36.290 --> 09:39.460
Naomi would love all
this old nautical stuff.

09:41.460 --> 09:44.250
Captain Chiloya. Huh.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.380
"In honor of the launch
of the Alegria

09:46.380 --> 09:49.290
this 13th day of July."

09:49.290 --> 09:53.000
What
That date can't be right.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.830
That would make them all
400 years old.

09:58.170 --> 10:00.500
Excuse me, I'm wondering
if you've seen my friend.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.620
She has blonde hair,
blue eyes, big mouth.

10:02.620 --> 10:05.040
Ah, that sounds
like Fancy Feet.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.040
She's below deck,
in the great cabin.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.290
Fancy Feet?

10:08.290 --> 10:10.380
Go Naomi! Go Naomi!

10:10.380 --> 10:12.460
Go Naomi! Go!

10:12.460 --> 10:14.500
Whoa! Uh!

10:19.000 --> 10:20.290
-Ah!
-Oh!

10:20.290 --> 10:21.960
-Oh, it's you.
-Oh, it's you.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.420
-Watch it!

10:23.420 --> 10:25.750
Would you let me in?

10:25.750 --> 10:28.420
-Guys, help!
-Naomi!

10:28.420 --> 10:31.670
Captain Chiloya put
some kind of spell on me!

10:31.670 --> 10:34.380
It's okay,
I know a reversal spell.

10:34.380 --> 10:37.330
-Zanamo!
-I'm still dancing.

10:39.460 --> 10:42.620
-Zanamo!
-Mateo!

10:42.620 --> 10:44.460
Why isn't my spell working?

10:44.460 --> 10:46.170
There should've at least
been a spark.

10:46.170 --> 10:47.790
Something weird's going on.

10:47.790 --> 10:51.880
Guys, Captain Chiloya
is over 400 years old.

10:51.880 --> 10:55.380
What?!
-But I don't look
a day over 300,

10:55.380 --> 10:59.000
if I do say so me-self.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.880
Ah, finally.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.290
But how can you
be that old?

11:04.290 --> 11:08.210
Because this ship is enchanted.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.080
Is that why my magic
isn't working?

11:10.080 --> 11:13.580
The only magic that works
on this ship is ours.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.330
But that's all ya need.

11:15.330 --> 11:19.580
Because with our magic,
you can live forever.

11:19.580 --> 11:21.250
No way.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.420
Let's tell 'em our tale, mates.

11:23.420 --> 11:25.420
Lights!

11:25.420 --> 11:28.960
-Music!

11:28.960 --> 11:31.170
Action!

11:31.170 --> 11:34.540
Oh, that's my cue.

11:34.540 --> 11:38.250
Our story begins 400 years ago,

Uh, but I think we're
just gonna be on our way.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.790
-Yep.
-Uh-huh.

13:49.790 --> 13:51.250
-Right now, if you don't mind.
-Ah, but I can't

13:51.250 --> 13:53.620
let ya leave
the party of a lifetime!

13:53.620 --> 13:55.920
It's the seafarer's way, mon.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.540
We look out for each other...
forever.

13:58.540 --> 14:02.540
So make yourself at home.
Cause this is your new home!

14:02.540 --> 14:05.040
-We have to get off this ship.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.460
-Now.
-Where did he say
they kept the rudders?

14:07.460 --> 14:09.580
-Uh, in the cargo hold.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.620
All of these old ships
have the same layout.

14:11.620 --> 14:13.670
The cargo hold
is right below us.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.500
Good. Elena and I
will get the rudder.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.120
-You guys distract the crew.
-I've got a better idea.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.380
Elena and I
will get the rudder,

14:20.380 --> 14:22.620
and you and Naomi
can do the distracting.

14:22.620 --> 14:25.500
-Does it really matter
who goes with Elena?
Yes!

14:25.500 --> 14:27.330
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you two,

14:27.330 --> 14:29.290
but we have to get
out of here fast.

14:29.290 --> 14:32.580
Naomi and I will distract the
crew, you two find the rudder.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.460
Then we'll all
meet up at our boat.

14:34.460 --> 14:35.670
-Whatever you want.
-You got it.

14:35.670 --> 14:36.830
Follow my lead.

14:36.830 --> 14:40.330
Captain Chiloya!
We've decided to stay!

14:40.330 --> 14:43.290
-I knew you'd come
to your senses.

14:43.290 --> 14:46.420
So, who's up
for a game of trompo?

14:47.880 --> 14:51.250
To the deck, mateys!

15:06.750 --> 15:07.750
Ah!

15:13.290 --> 15:16.750
-Our captain is the best!

15:16.750 --> 15:21.170
Correct you are!

15:21.170 --> 15:22.710
Like a pirate.

15:22.710 --> 15:24.710
I don't think
I can take hearing that joke

15:24.710 --> 15:27.960
-for the next 400 years.
Me neither.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.080
I hope the guys find
the rudder soon.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.960
The moon is starting to rise.

15:31.960 --> 15:36.620
Harpoon, ropes, hooks.
Where are the rudders?

15:36.620 --> 15:39.750
-I don't know.
-Well, look harder.
You got us into this mess,

15:39.750 --> 15:41.580
trying to show off
your magic spells.

15:41.580 --> 15:44.210
And what exactly were you doing,
pulling up the rudder

15:44.210 --> 15:46.420
without making sure
it was properly secured?

15:46.420 --> 15:48.710
You're just as much
to blame as I am.

15:48.710 --> 15:51.330
-Let's just find the rudder.
-Here they are!

15:55.380 --> 15:59.120
Step aside. I'll do it.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.670
Let me help you with that.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.620
-I could've gotten it myself.
-Uh-huh.

16:22.420 --> 16:23.960
I never lose.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.290
Uh... beginner's luck?

16:29.420 --> 16:30.710
Best two out of three.

16:30.710 --> 16:32.380
Okay.

16:32.380 --> 16:34.920
...hundred!

16:39.670 --> 16:41.290
Look!

16:42.830 --> 16:44.540
Tell you what, Captain.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.710
Why don't you and your crew
play the next few rounds,

16:46.710 --> 16:50.000
then after the moon's up
and we're part of the crew,

16:50.000 --> 16:51.670
I'll give you that rematch?

16:51.670 --> 16:54.250
You're on.
Let's go, mateys!

17:03.250 --> 17:05.500
How are we going to get
the rudder down to the boat?

17:05.500 --> 17:08.080
-Good question.
Yes! You found it!

17:08.080 --> 17:11.040
Okay, now let's get out of here
before they notice we're gone.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.880
Ah! The rudder's too heavy
for one person

17:14.880 --> 17:17.040
-to carry it down the ladder.
-I've got an idea.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.880
I'll slide down to the
sailboat with the rudder.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.250
But you can't carry it
on your own.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.670
Of course I can.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.120
Ha! There you go,

17:29.120 --> 17:31.080
trying to show off again,

17:31.080 --> 17:33.750
when it's not going
to change anything.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.670
You're right.
I'm still her best friend!

17:35.670 --> 17:38.540
No, I am!

17:38.540 --> 17:41.290
-Shh! They'll hear you.
-What are you even
arguing about?

17:43.790 --> 17:45.040
-Mateo!
-Gabe!

17:47.120 --> 17:48.880
Well, at least it
fell inside the boat.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.670
Okay, what is going on?

17:50.670 --> 17:52.420
That's what
I'd like to know.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.250
Captain Chiloya!

17:54.250 --> 17:57.460
You are a clever one,
tryin' to sneak off me ship.

17:57.460 --> 18:00.920
Perhaps I'll make ya me
second mate when the moon rises.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.380
It's almost time. Ah!

18:08.830 --> 18:11.790
There.
Now you're stuck with us.

18:11.790 --> 18:15.710
So I say we throw ya
a welcome party!
Who's with me?

18:15.710 --> 18:19.580
I am, Captain!

18:22.960 --> 18:25.040
Should I keep
an eye on them, Captain?

18:25.040 --> 18:27.750
What for? There's nowhere
for them to go.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.960
Let's go plan their party.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.540
Great. We're trapped
on this ship forever

18:35.540 --> 18:38.920
because you guys had to prove
you were Elena's best friend.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.290
-Yeah.

18:42.290 --> 18:44.540
-It is.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.790
Look, you're all
my best friends.

18:46.790 --> 18:49.290
A person can have
more than one, you know.

18:49.290 --> 18:52.000
-You're right.
-Well, technically,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.920
"best" means "one"... uh!

18:53.920 --> 18:56.040
But I guess,
when you think about it,

18:56.040 --> 18:58.120
-we're all best friends.
-Yes.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.880
And there's still time to figure
out a way off this ship

19:00.880 --> 19:03.040
if we all start acting like it.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.080
-Got it.
-Okay.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.040
Well, if I had a flying gaff,
I could hook the boat

19:09.040 --> 19:10.670
with it
and pull it closer.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.290
I don't know
about a flying gaff,

19:12.290 --> 19:14.580
but I saw a bunch of harpoons
and hooks in the cargo hold.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.920
-A flying gaff is a big hook.
-Then they've got one.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.670
But how do we get past
Captain Chiloya and his crew?

19:19.670 --> 19:24.120
We don't need to. I just
need to find... the hatch.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.880
You really do know
these old ships.

19:32.830 --> 19:35.830
This is going to be
the party of the century.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.580
All right, then. Better
fetch our guests of honor.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.040
Aye, aye, Captain.

19:43.540 --> 19:45.790
Captain!
They're not there!

19:45.790 --> 19:48.920
I didn't hear a splash, so
they must be somewhere aboard.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.210
Find them.

19:52.210 --> 19:54.250
Well, not in here.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.500
Let's go.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.040
I've caught a lot of things

20:01.040 --> 20:03.000
in my life,
but never a sailboat.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.420
There's a first time
for everything.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.000
Mmm-hmm. Here goes.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.420
The moon's almost up! Hurry!

20:16.960 --> 20:20.380
-Nice throw, Fancy Feet.
-Now help me pull it in.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.880
All right.
Start climbing down.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.880
-You two first.
-Okay.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.670
Hurry!
We're almost out of time!

20:41.830 --> 20:43.420
Mateo, you go next.

20:43.420 --> 20:46.380
But someone has to keep
the boat from floating away.

20:46.380 --> 20:48.120
Don't worry about me.
Save yourself.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.880
I'm not leaving without you.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.540
Um... I think
I have an idea.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.120
What are you guys doing?

20:57.120 --> 20:58.790
The boat's floating away.

21:11.330 --> 21:13.000
You made it!

21:14.540 --> 21:16.670
Oh, what a shame!

21:16.670 --> 21:19.620
I was looking forward
to having some new mates.

21:19.620 --> 21:23.710
And you are missing
the party of a lifetime!

21:23.710 --> 21:27.460
-Until forever!

21:29.670 --> 21:32.920
Because that's how long
we're going to live!

21:36.500 --> 21:38.670
Forever!

21:41.250 --> 21:43.830
-That was close.

21:43.830 --> 21:46.710
I don't know about you guys,
but that's the last time

21:46.710 --> 21:49.460
I get on a strange ship
in the middle of the ocean.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.120
Well, should we head back?

21:51.120 --> 21:52.790
Uh, not yet.

21:52.790 --> 21:56.670
It's a nice night to be out
sailing with my best friend...

21:56.670 --> 21:59.040
...s.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.080
Correct you are!

22:03.500 --> 22:05.420
Like a pirate.
