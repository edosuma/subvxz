00:26.166 --> 00:27.208
Huh?

00:29.041 --> 00:30.291
Hmm.

00:38.166 --> 00:39.917
Grr.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.792
Eek!

00:41.792 --> 00:43.166
I'm workin' on it!

00:43.166 --> 00:45.083
Aloha, Mickey!

00:45.083 --> 00:47.208
Ready to hit the waves?

00:47.208 --> 00:49.333
Sorry, fellas.
Not now.

00:49.333 --> 00:53.709
Uh, I'm trying to finish this
melody, but I just can't figure it out!

00:53.709 --> 00:54.959
Listen, Mick.

00:54.959 --> 00:58.291
You gotta mellow out.

00:58.291 --> 01:01.333
Yeah, relax and everything

01:01.333 --> 01:04.625
will just flow-ow-ow.

01:05.458 --> 01:06.917
Mmm.

01:06.917 --> 01:08.291
Yeah, you're right.

01:08.291 --> 01:10.083
Let's hang ten!

01:10.083 --> 01:11.458
Yeah!
Cowabunga!

01:18.083 --> 01:20.375
Hey, where's Mickey?
I don't know.

01:32.208 --> 01:33.208
My melody?

01:38.834 --> 01:39.834
Ahh.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.875
Guys!
That girl!

01:54.875 --> 01:57.000
She knows my melody!
Did you hear it?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.542
I didn't hear nothin'.

01:59.959 --> 02:01.750
I didn't see nothing.

02:02.792 --> 02:03.583
Huh?

02:04.333 --> 02:05.583
She disappeared.

02:06.542 --> 02:09.625
Maybe what you saw was an akua,

02:10.250 --> 02:13.166
an island spirit.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.417
Ah, phooey.

02:14.417 --> 02:16.250
I never seen any spirits.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.834
And I know the island like
the back of my hand.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.291
Huh?

02:20.291 --> 02:22.208
It goes like this...

02:24.917 --> 02:25.875
Oh.

02:41.458 --> 02:42.583
Hold on a sec.

02:55.792 --> 02:57.542
Guys! Guys!
She's back!

02:57.542 --> 02:59.291
My melody!

03:01.333 --> 03:03.208
She's in there?

03:03.208 --> 03:04.291
Yeah!

03:04.291 --> 03:05.333
Come on!

03:11.917 --> 03:14.250
We don't want to disturb the spirits.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.041
You know, akua.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.417
Shh!
Akua.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.583
Shh.
Akua.

03:19.583 --> 03:20.583
Gesundheit.

03:20.583 --> 03:22.375
Huh?

03:25.875 --> 03:27.083
Great idea, guys!

03:27.083 --> 03:28.500
Let's split up.

03:59.959 --> 04:01.291
Whoa!

04:02.625 --> 04:03.583
Ow!

04:06.917 --> 04:08.375
Akua!

04:13.458 --> 04:15.792
Well, she gave me a few
pieces of the melody,

04:15.792 --> 04:17.417
but there's still something else.

04:17.417 --> 04:19.166
Oh, I'm goin' coconuts here!

04:19.166 --> 04:22.000
Maybe the akua are testing us.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.542
We need to <i>pule</i>

04:23.542 --> 04:25.542
and do ho'oponopono to ask our kapuna

04:25.542 --> 04:27.417
to guide us in our <i>huaka'i.</i>

04:29.125 --> 04:30.291
Or we could just go find her.

04:58.250 --> 04:59.834
We found her!

05:01.166 --> 05:02.417
Right behind you.

05:09.458 --> 05:12.208
Why!

05:14.875 --> 05:17.333
Did you get it?

05:19.625 --> 05:21.500
No, but we're going to get it.
Huh?

05:32.542 --> 05:35.458
Ya know, I been thinkin'.

05:35.458 --> 05:38.208
Maybe there's no island
spirits after all.

05:38.208 --> 05:39.959
That's what I've been saying!

05:39.959 --> 05:42.333
But, I saw her.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.583
Maybe it's time to give up.

05:44.583 --> 05:47.458
Some dreams are just meant to fly away.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.667
Like my hair.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.750
Well, see ya back at the car, Mick.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.000
Wait, we have a car?

06:19.208 --> 06:21.333
