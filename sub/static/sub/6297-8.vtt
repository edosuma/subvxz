00:00.016 --> 00:01.705
<i>Previously on The Borgias...</i>

00:01.825 --> 00:04.526
May I present
Don Hernando de Caballos.

00:04.593 --> 00:06.190
He was at
the Siege of Granada.

00:06.191 --> 00:07.983
We had a siege in mind.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.951
Catherina Sforza,
has been threatening war.

00:10.952 --> 00:14.539
Give us occasion to
to bend her knee to Rome.

00:14.741 --> 00:17.077
Grab the boy!
Grab the boy!

00:17.705 --> 00:19.296
Here is your son!

00:19.558 --> 00:21.459
He is waiting to die!

00:22.135 --> 00:24.947
I have the means to
produce TEN MORE SONS!

00:25.408 --> 00:26.836
Madame,
may I present my brother,

00:26.837 --> 00:29.088
<i>Calvino Pallavicini da Genova.</i>

00:29.375 --> 00:31.543
Lady.
I am honoured.

00:31.812 --> 00:33.651
It's the brother, yes?

00:33.660 --> 00:34.755
Why not?

00:34.835 --> 00:36.169
Your father will never agree.

00:36.628 --> 00:39.411
You are marrying
for all of us, Lucrezia,

00:39.412 --> 00:40.571
not just yourself.

00:40.572 --> 00:41.472
For family!

00:41.473 --> 00:43.140
Girolamo Savonarola!

00:43.265 --> 00:44.405
This edict finds
you guilty

00:44.406 --> 00:46.276
of disseminating
pernicious doctrines.

00:46.277 --> 00:47.558
You are hereby ordered

00:47.559 --> 00:49.592
to suspend your
sermons and prophecies.

00:49.670 --> 00:51.322
I will use it...

00:51.409 --> 00:53.555
...to wipe my ass!

00:54.287 --> 00:56.442
We have one among us
who would be a martyr.

00:57.049 --> 00:58.982
Take note of the man
with the water jug.

00:59.423 --> 01:02.058
He's the pope's taster.

01:02.126 --> 01:05.428
Ludovico of Milan is
marching on Forli.

01:05.495 --> 01:06.763
Could a messenger
reach my brother

01:06.864 --> 01:08.031
in time to warn him?

01:08.099 --> 01:09.318
That would depend

01:09.386 --> 01:11.916
on how fast the messenger
chooses to ride.

01:12.017 --> 01:14.548
We are under attack!

01:14.615 --> 01:16.011
Kill the boy!

01:16.113 --> 01:17.278
Hang him!

01:17.379 --> 01:18.710
Yah!

03:03.486 --> 03:04.953
Your Holiness?

03:05.020 --> 03:07.589
Holiness, may we intrude?
Sh.

03:10.159 --> 03:12.761
Holiness, we have
received some news.

03:14.531 --> 03:17.766
Well, it must be good news
to cause such levity.

03:17.834 --> 03:19.769
Go on.
Tell us.

03:19.836 --> 03:22.238
Uh, Charles, the, uh,
King of France, um...

03:23.640 --> 03:25.341
Go on.

03:25.408 --> 03:28.344
He is dead.

03:28.412 --> 03:30.914
This is a cause for amusement?

03:30.982 --> 03:33.583
No, not to me,
Holiness.

03:36.487 --> 03:39.122
Um...

03:39.190 --> 03:43.427
...it appears
he banged his head.

03:43.494 --> 03:45.529
While, uh, stooping
through a low doorway.

03:45.630 --> 03:47.297
After playing tennis!

03:47.365 --> 03:50.067
Being short,
it is a miracle

03:50.134 --> 03:51.601
that he found
a doorway low enough.

03:53.538 --> 03:55.972
There was more steel

03:56.040 --> 03:58.608
in that heroic
king's diminished frame

03:58.676 --> 04:02.145
than can be found
in both your bodies.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.981
Shame on you.
You shall both kneel.

04:08.651 --> 04:12.354
Say the rosary
one dozen times

04:12.455 --> 04:15.089
for the repose
of his eternal soul.

04:17.759 --> 04:21.329
On reflection...

04:21.397 --> 04:23.965
...make that three dozen.

04:31.841 --> 04:34.910
In Patris et Filli
et Spiritus Sancti.

04:34.978 --> 04:36.245
Amen.

04:36.312 --> 04:38.647
<i>Faster!</i>
<i>Careful!</i>

04:38.714 --> 04:40.181
Faster!

04:42.985 --> 04:44.886
Stop.
Stop!

04:49.725 --> 04:51.926
Help me.

04:51.993 --> 04:53.794
Help me!
Sorry, my lord.

05:07.175 --> 05:10.243
We were attacked...

05:10.311 --> 05:12.979
<i>...from all sides.</i>

05:13.047 --> 05:14.681
<i>Ludovico Sforza's army</i>

05:14.748 --> 05:17.484
<i>came like a flood</i>
<i>from the forest.</i>

05:17.585 --> 05:20.120
We fought long and hard.

05:20.221 --> 05:22.556
I got hit...

05:22.657 --> 05:24.925
...by an arrow...

05:24.993 --> 05:27.294
...in the leg.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.529
I could not move.

05:28.597 --> 05:31.465
But we fought on,
back to back.

05:34.135 --> 05:39.172
Men cried,
"For God, for Alexander"

05:39.240 --> 05:41.807
<i>as they perished.</i>

05:41.875 --> 05:43.742
Then I fell.

05:45.445 --> 05:50.649
I lost my sensibility.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.885
And the battle faded.

05:52.953 --> 05:57.289
When I awoke,
all I could hear

05:57.357 --> 06:01.127
were the cries of the dying.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.931
<i>But I escaped in the dark.</i>

06:12.907 --> 06:15.942
We commend your bravery,
but...

06:16.010 --> 06:19.947
...what should have
been a glorious victory

06:20.014 --> 06:22.783
is an ignominious defeat.

06:25.987 --> 06:30.291
Il Moro must have had word.

06:30.359 --> 06:33.127
Of this, this is certain.

06:33.228 --> 06:35.796
Cesare was in Florence.

06:35.864 --> 06:38.299
Why did he not come to warn us
of Ludovico's attack?

06:38.367 --> 06:40.134
How could he have known?

06:40.235 --> 06:42.337
An army was on the move!

06:42.438 --> 06:44.006
How could he not have known?

06:44.074 --> 06:47.743
Cesare was in Florence
with Machiavelli.

06:47.811 --> 06:50.780
Machiavelli has spies!

06:50.848 --> 06:53.517
Machiavelli knows everything!

07:06.430 --> 07:08.131
There.

07:08.199 --> 07:10.166
Who is it?

07:10.234 --> 07:12.134
Tell him who you are.

07:17.740 --> 07:19.608
Look at me, boy.

07:23.981 --> 07:25.681
Come closer,

07:25.749 --> 07:28.250
<i>or I'll come in</i>
<i>there and get you.</i>

07:36.759 --> 07:39.361
This is Catherina
Sforza's son, Benito.

07:39.428 --> 07:41.896
What's he doing here?

07:41.964 --> 07:44.566
What happened to your hand?
Show me.

07:44.633 --> 07:46.601
<i>A finger was cut off.</i>

07:46.669 --> 07:49.203
Who by?
Do I need to tell you?

07:49.271 --> 07:51.439
Look at his arms, his neck.

07:53.075 --> 07:56.077
Come, show me.

07:56.144 --> 07:58.345
Come.

08:08.759 --> 08:11.161
Juan did this?

08:11.228 --> 08:13.563
An order was given
for him to be hanged.

08:13.664 --> 08:15.065
I saved him.

08:15.133 --> 08:16.901
Did Juan bring him to Rome?

08:16.969 --> 08:19.103
<i>No, no, he believes</i>
<i>the boy to be dead.</i>

08:19.171 --> 08:21.138
He is here
for safekeeping.

08:21.206 --> 08:23.274
The cardinal gave me
the key to this place.

08:23.341 --> 08:25.809
What cardinal?
Sforza.

08:25.877 --> 08:28.880
The boy, the cardinal,
they are family.

08:28.947 --> 08:32.250
The poison in this
wound runs deep.

08:32.317 --> 08:34.751
He will lose an arm
or hand, at least.

08:36.889 --> 08:39.291
Best I kill you now.

08:39.392 --> 08:41.227
And kill the truth?

08:41.294 --> 08:44.030
This boy saw what
happened at the siege.

08:44.097 --> 08:47.367
He witnessed your brother
<i>run like a coward.</i>

08:47.468 --> 08:50.103
<i>So why did you save him?</i>

08:50.171 --> 08:53.073
It is a matter of honour.

08:53.141 --> 08:56.744
I fight the men,
not the boys.

08:59.681 --> 09:01.115
Pity.

09:12.626 --> 09:14.527
Get off!

09:21.035 --> 09:23.035
Go. Go!

09:24.104 --> 09:26.205
My brother, the hero.

09:26.306 --> 09:28.007
Did I say "stop"?

09:53.836 --> 09:58.139
Your brother fought to
within an inch of his life.

10:01.511 --> 10:05.780
He says that you had knowledge
<i>of the attack against him,</i>

10:05.848 --> 10:10.183
but that you failed
to send him a warning.

10:10.251 --> 10:13.119
If you want to know the truth
of what happened at Forli,

10:13.187 --> 10:15.889
you must ask those
who were there.

10:15.956 --> 10:19.792
Multitude of men died.

10:19.859 --> 10:22.428
We must atone
for their deaths.

10:25.032 --> 10:27.333
But you think

10:27.401 --> 10:29.235
that there is
another story?

10:30.870 --> 10:33.605
Our Holy Father has forbidden
discord between his sons.

10:33.706 --> 10:35.674
I am here to obey my father

10:35.741 --> 10:38.309
and to neither praise
nor condemn my brother.

10:38.377 --> 10:42.013
But if we had divested
you of your robes,

10:42.081 --> 10:46.251
<i>if you were at</i>
<i>the Siege of Forli,</i>

10:46.352 --> 10:48.520
would you
have triumphed?

10:52.291 --> 10:54.960
I would have been
there to the end.

11:02.202 --> 11:04.270
We will learn
the truth of this.

11:09.310 --> 11:11.478
Ah! Now...

11:11.546 --> 11:15.283
<i>...to another matter</i>
<i>that weighs upon our papacy.</i>

11:17.186 --> 11:23.056
We hear that fires
burn bright in Florence

11:23.124 --> 11:26.326
and the Friar Savonarola
still preaches.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.662
The people flock to him.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.631
You gave him our
apostolic letter

11:30.699 --> 11:32.266
commanding his silence?

11:32.334 --> 11:34.101
And he wiped his ass upon it.

11:34.202 --> 11:35.502
So...

11:35.570 --> 11:38.705
we must lay charges
of heresy against him.

11:38.773 --> 11:40.741
And he will laugh-

11:40.842 --> 11:43.877
Laugh in our face.
We know.

11:43.945 --> 11:47.448
I do not have authority
to lay the charge of heresy.

11:47.549 --> 11:49.516
Patience.

11:49.584 --> 11:52.920
You will have it.

11:52.987 --> 11:55.622
You will return...

11:59.127 --> 12:02.095
...to Florence
once more

12:02.163 --> 12:04.732
and it will be as if
God's vicar himself

12:04.800 --> 12:06.867
stands before him.

12:08.703 --> 12:11.104
If it is your wish,
Holy Father.

12:15.543 --> 12:18.978
Not ours alone, Cesare.

12:19.046 --> 12:22.281
Remember, it is God's
work that we do.

12:32.190 --> 12:35.459
Ah.

12:35.526 --> 12:41.364
Now, somewhere in here,
it is written

12:41.432 --> 12:46.102
that we have the power
to pronounce

12:46.170 --> 12:50.940
an ecclesiastical
curse upon this friar.

12:51.008 --> 12:57.681
A God-given power to
condemn him to Hell.

12:57.749 --> 12:59.849
A ritual.

12:59.917 --> 13:02.953
Your Holiness?

13:03.021 --> 13:05.122
Ah!

13:23.542 --> 13:25.209
What did he tell you?

13:25.277 --> 13:26.877
Of whom do you speak,
Brother?

13:26.978 --> 13:29.146
Hernando de Caballos.

13:29.247 --> 13:31.082
Ah.

13:31.149 --> 13:35.186
He told me of your
bravery at Forli.

13:35.254 --> 13:37.755
How you stood side
by side with your men

13:37.823 --> 13:39.824
and fought bravely on.

13:39.892 --> 13:42.694
How you upheld
the name of Borgia

13:42.761 --> 13:46.131
and protected the
honour of our family.

13:46.198 --> 13:49.801
What else do you think
he might have told me, Brother?

13:49.902 --> 13:53.905
And what did you
tell our father?

13:53.973 --> 13:57.308
What could I tell him?
You know the truth.

13:59.544 --> 14:01.879
You were there.

14:24.036 --> 14:27.538
Have faith,
your Eminences.

14:27.639 --> 14:30.808
Only 14 days until
the end of Lent.

14:33.178 --> 14:35.046
Pure, Your Holiness.

14:37.949 --> 14:42.152
We remain in the wilderness.

14:44.389 --> 14:46.623
Super hoc expavit cor meum

14:46.691 --> 14:49.426
<i>et emotum est de loco suo.</i>

14:49.494 --> 14:52.262
<i>A living death.</i>

14:52.330 --> 14:53.664
True.

14:53.732 --> 14:55.532
Yet each time
he returns to life

14:55.600 --> 14:57.701
with a renewed spirit.

14:57.769 --> 14:59.970
He's at one with life

15:00.038 --> 15:02.873
yet willing to go happily
to his own death.

15:02.940 --> 15:04.741
He is ready then.

15:04.842 --> 15:06.643
You have done your work.

15:06.710 --> 15:09.011
Yes, but we have a hazard,
Brother Sylvio.

15:09.112 --> 15:10.612
What is that?

15:10.680 --> 15:13.882
Brother Bernadino.
The pope's taster.

15:13.950 --> 15:15.984
Ah, yes, of course.

15:16.051 --> 15:18.553
For as long as he remains
by the pope's side,

15:18.621 --> 15:21.089
our mission
is in purgatory.

15:21.157 --> 15:23.292
I hear the man is
a charitable soul.

15:23.393 --> 15:25.093
There is the point.

15:25.161 --> 15:27.262
It is one thing to kill
this pernicious pope,

15:27.363 --> 15:28.997
for which
we have blessing,

15:29.098 --> 15:30.598
but it is
quite another

15:30.666 --> 15:34.570
to kill this Brother
Bernadino, a man of God,

15:34.671 --> 15:36.271
devoted to his faith.

15:36.373 --> 15:38.540
<i>We too must have faith.</i>

15:38.608 --> 15:40.910
God will guide us.

15:51.589 --> 15:53.390
Mm.

15:53.492 --> 15:55.359
What's your prediction?

15:55.427 --> 15:58.362
Of your condition?
What else?

15:58.429 --> 16:00.731
In a word, my lord,
in the long term-

16:00.798 --> 16:06.102
blindness, madness, death.

16:06.170 --> 16:07.770
That is three words.

16:07.871 --> 16:09.905
And then there is your leg.

16:09.973 --> 16:11.740
If the contamination
cannot be abated,

16:11.841 --> 16:13.942
it may have to be removed.

16:14.010 --> 16:15.944
My leg?

16:16.012 --> 16:18.113
That is to be my destiny-

16:18.180 --> 16:20.749
a pox-ridden blind
madman with one leg?

16:20.816 --> 16:23.084
We pray not, Excellency.

16:23.152 --> 16:25.554
Relief is at hand.

16:26.923 --> 16:29.559
Here is a medicament
much appreciated

16:29.626 --> 16:32.229
by our Roman ancestors,

16:32.330 --> 16:35.666
an extraction of
homegrown efflorescence.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.435
Tell me what it does.

16:37.502 --> 16:38.936
It has long been
known to relieve pain,

16:39.004 --> 16:40.671
such as that in your leg,

16:40.739 --> 16:42.606
and it also calms
disturbances of the bowel.

16:42.674 --> 16:44.575
And let us not forget
my privy member.

16:46.444 --> 16:47.677
I have often thought
that a fortune

16:47.745 --> 16:49.412
might be made
by its export.

16:49.513 --> 16:51.414
What's it called?

16:51.482 --> 16:53.015
It's commonly
called opium.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.583
Uh, sometimes it
is referred to

16:54.684 --> 16:58.554
as the tears
of the poppy.

16:58.622 --> 17:00.289
How very poetic.

17:00.357 --> 17:02.024
Hm.

17:08.032 --> 17:11.335
Calvino Pallavicini,
his good-for-nothing brother,

17:11.435 --> 17:13.137
and his entire retinue-
Sh! Sh!

17:13.204 --> 17:16.508
-of aides and auxiliaries,
repose at our expense,

17:16.575 --> 17:19.912
while we wait for our daughter
to emerge from her chamber.

17:19.979 --> 17:22.680
We would see an end to
this procrastination!

17:22.748 --> 17:25.584
Sh!

17:25.651 --> 17:28.252
I wish I hadn't been
volunteered for this.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.589
<i>Far better to</i>
<i>arrange a funeral.</i>

17:30.657 --> 17:32.791
The dead don't bicker.

17:32.892 --> 17:34.592
The Pallavicini are a family

17:34.660 --> 17:36.528
of immense power and influence.

17:36.596 --> 17:38.463
Calvino Pallavicini
is a merchant of wealth,

17:38.531 --> 17:40.298
they have a vast
array of ships,

17:40.366 --> 17:42.034
and, what's more,
he has Spanish blood!

17:42.101 --> 17:43.402
On the mother's side.

17:43.469 --> 17:45.037
Well, any side will do!

17:45.104 --> 17:48.106
We would see a
betrothal today!

17:48.174 --> 17:50.709
We will do what we can.
Thank you!

17:50.777 --> 17:52.878
Although why I am
charged with this task

17:52.945 --> 17:54.079
remains a mystery.

17:54.180 --> 17:56.715
Well, long may it remain so.

18:04.823 --> 18:06.591
<i>Incoming!</i>

18:06.658 --> 18:07.892
<i>We need more hands</i>
<i>on the top level!</i>

18:07.959 --> 18:09.226
<i>Good!</i>

18:25.411 --> 18:27.445
Beautiful.

18:41.028 --> 18:43.929
We are being ridiculed, my sons.

18:44.030 --> 18:46.632
<i>From Rome to Venice.</i>

18:46.700 --> 18:49.200
<i>The Friar Savonarola</i>

18:49.268 --> 18:52.470
<i>is howling his</i>
<i>iniquities from Florence.</i>

18:52.571 --> 18:55.272
<i>Posted on every tavern wall,</i>

18:55.373 --> 18:58.241
scrawled and scribbled,

18:58.309 --> 19:05.283
Catherina Sforza's supposed
words: "Ten more sons."

19:05.350 --> 19:07.752
I have heard these words.

19:07.820 --> 19:11.924
A scurrilous fancy, Father.

19:11.992 --> 19:14.093
<i>But rumour has it</i>

19:14.194 --> 19:17.297
that you
captured her son

19:17.398 --> 19:19.032
and she stood on
the battlements,

19:19.100 --> 19:20.600
raised her skirts
above her head,

19:20.668 --> 19:22.168
and said,
"Don't you realize, Borgia,

19:22.236 --> 19:24.104
I can have 10 more sons?"

19:24.205 --> 19:26.940
Lies, Father.

19:34.981 --> 19:38.316
We would know the truth.

19:41.220 --> 19:46.225
I captured her son,
laid siege to her castle,

19:46.293 --> 19:50.763
Ludovico Sforza came to her aid,

19:50.831 --> 19:53.366
and her son died
in the heat of the battle.

19:55.435 --> 19:59.472
To which you gave your all.

19:59.540 --> 20:01.374
Why do you say that?

20:03.510 --> 20:05.645
Look!

20:05.713 --> 20:08.148
This wound is killing me!

20:08.216 --> 20:10.150
<i>What more is there</i>
<i>for me to give?</i>

20:10.218 --> 20:13.420
It's all right, sit down.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.498
Cesare.

20:25.733 --> 20:27.701
I have no tale to tell.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.936
The tale you do not tell is
why you chose not to warn me

20:30.004 --> 20:31.939
of Ludovico Sforza's attack.

20:32.006 --> 20:33.607
Had I known,
I would have warned you.

20:33.675 --> 20:35.209
How could you
NOT have known?

20:35.276 --> 20:38.912
I was sent by our Holy Father
on a different mission.

20:38.980 --> 20:42.116
Had you not laid siege
to Catherina Sforza's bed,

20:42.183 --> 20:43.851
<i>there would have</i>
<i>been no bloodshed.</i>

20:43.919 --> 20:45.954
Ten more sons.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.626
Ah!

20:50.727 --> 20:52.896
Quiet.
Quiet.

20:52.997 --> 20:54.798
Come on.

20:54.866 --> 20:57.167
Do you know what
is more poisonous

20:57.235 --> 21:01.605
than failure
in war or politics?

21:01.672 --> 21:03.440
Ridicule!

21:19.890 --> 21:21.324
Lady Lucrezia.

21:21.391 --> 21:22.692
Oh.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.727
You see, I'm following
your instructions.

21:24.794 --> 21:27.262
Only meat.
Good.

21:28.798 --> 21:31.800
I have never seen
these rooms before.

21:31.867 --> 21:34.035
My father has made
you comfortable?

21:34.102 --> 21:36.437
Yes.
Most generous.

21:39.707 --> 21:42.743
And...
your brother?

21:42.811 --> 21:45.546
I believe it is your brother
who travels with you, yes?

21:45.647 --> 21:48.148
Yes.

21:48.216 --> 21:50.718
Yes, he has a chamber-
here.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.454
He's not here at this time.

21:53.555 --> 21:56.190
Oh.

22:00.463 --> 22:02.832
Your Excellency,
I think it is not appropriate

22:02.899 --> 22:04.366
that we are alone together
without attendants.

22:04.434 --> 22:07.970
You must excuse me.
Lady.

22:08.038 --> 22:11.107
Lady Lucrezia.

22:11.175 --> 22:13.843
You are VERY beautiful.

22:13.944 --> 22:17.280
Thank you.

22:17.381 --> 22:20.550
And you, your Excellency,
you are most handsome.

22:44.076 --> 22:45.743
<i>Enjoy.</i>
<i>God bless you!</i>

22:45.811 --> 22:47.412
Fresh fish!
Fresh fish!

22:47.479 --> 22:52.384
His Holiness is immersed himself
in a theatre of penitence.

22:52.452 --> 22:56.322
He has discovered
sobriety, abstinence.

22:56.389 --> 23:00.659
It's as if the Lenten fast
had only just been invented.

23:00.727 --> 23:04.229
The pope's taster buys
his food, chooses his fish,

23:04.297 --> 23:06.164
guts them, prepares them.

23:06.232 --> 23:08.466
You don't like
the smell of fish?

23:08.534 --> 23:10.034
No.

23:10.102 --> 23:11.502
But while the pope
still has a taster,

23:11.570 --> 23:13.671
my mission remains
in purgatory.

23:13.738 --> 23:15.506
I want only the best
<i>for His Holiness.</i>

23:15.573 --> 23:17.674
God will show us the way.

23:25.250 --> 23:26.818
The boy, Benito,

23:26.885 --> 23:29.855
I leave him in your charge,
for safekeeping.

23:29.922 --> 23:32.457
He must be given life.

23:32.525 --> 23:36.328
You are an honoured guest,
Don Hernando.

23:36.429 --> 23:39.131
I would have you stay.

23:43.068 --> 23:47.404
Your Eminence,

23:47.472 --> 23:50.240
I do not wish to play this game
I see you all play.

23:52.310 --> 23:54.477
You Borgias.

23:54.545 --> 23:57.580
The Sforzas.
Orsini. Medici.

23:57.648 --> 24:03.520
All of you,
here in this beautiful land.

24:03.587 --> 24:09.326
God gives you riches,
and you kill for more.

24:09.394 --> 24:11.695
I would have no part of this.

24:11.763 --> 24:15.333
I have said
all I wish to say of Forli.

24:15.434 --> 24:17.302
You know the truth.

24:17.369 --> 24:19.003
And your father,

24:19.071 --> 24:22.573
he seeks truth
he already knows.

24:26.044 --> 24:28.579
Hmm.

24:28.647 --> 24:31.548
I would leave now,

24:31.616 --> 24:34.885
before you find my body
floating in the Tiber.

24:51.534 --> 24:56.170
The man I am to replace,
the pope's taster,

24:56.238 --> 24:57.805
what kind of man is he?

24:57.906 --> 24:59.339
Do you know him?

24:59.407 --> 25:01.175
I know of him.

25:01.243 --> 25:03.276
Is he of this order?

25:03.344 --> 25:04.879
No, he's not.

25:04.946 --> 25:07.014
Why do you ask,
little brother?

25:07.082 --> 25:10.718
That I might learn how best
to become the pope's taster.

25:10.819 --> 25:13.387
Is he a man of God?

25:13.455 --> 25:16.324
He's known to be
a charitable soul.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.627
Every day he distributes
food to the poor.

25:19.695 --> 25:21.730
So, he is a man of God, then?

25:21.831 --> 25:25.634
Wrong question.

25:25.735 --> 25:27.535
The question is,

25:27.603 --> 25:31.473
does Brother Bernadino
serve a man of God?

25:31.541 --> 25:35.644
If goodness places itself
in the service of badness,

25:35.745 --> 25:39.281
does it still deserve the name?

25:39.349 --> 25:42.818
As a taster,
you must know your trade.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.521
Which would you like?

25:46.589 --> 25:48.924
It is impossible.
I cannot decide.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.192
Choose.

25:51.260 --> 25:54.196
This is torrone
with hazelnuts.

25:54.297 --> 25:55.630
And this is canditi.

25:55.698 --> 25:56.898
Yes.

25:56.965 --> 25:58.466
I love them both.

25:58.567 --> 26:00.300
Then which one will you eat?

26:01.769 --> 26:03.470
I don't know.

26:03.538 --> 26:04.938
What's your name?

26:06.374 --> 26:10.377
Mother, what a question;
what game is this?

26:10.478 --> 26:12.912
The game is your name,
Lucrezia.

26:13.013 --> 26:15.215
What is your name?

26:15.316 --> 26:16.582
Lucrezia.

26:16.684 --> 26:18.618
Lucrezia who?

26:19.954 --> 26:21.454
Borgia.

26:21.522 --> 26:24.558
Yes, Borgia.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.127
Do you understand?

26:27.228 --> 26:29.396
You are a Borgia.

26:29.464 --> 26:32.566
You can have both,
Lucrezia Borgia.

26:34.969 --> 26:38.105
Now I see the game.

26:38.172 --> 26:42.843
It is a game of love-
and lust.

26:42.910 --> 26:44.945
And marriage.

26:48.783 --> 26:51.585
Which is Raffaello
and which is Calvino?

26:54.723 --> 26:56.825
It doesn't matter.

26:56.892 --> 26:59.327
That's the point of the game.

26:59.395 --> 27:01.129
Have both.

27:01.230 --> 27:02.697
Marry one and have the other.

27:02.765 --> 27:04.132
Have them one at
a time or two together,

27:04.200 --> 27:05.600
it's no matter.

27:05.668 --> 27:07.670
After a while you
will tire of both

27:07.737 --> 27:09.772
and take a lover.

27:10.841 --> 27:12.742
Lucrezia, look at me.

27:12.810 --> 27:14.577
Look me in the eye.

27:16.047 --> 27:17.948
Eat.

27:29.959 --> 27:31.860
And now the other.

27:39.869 --> 27:43.138
Mm.

27:43.239 --> 27:45.574
Delicious.

27:45.642 --> 27:47.243
There.

27:47.344 --> 27:50.079
You see.

27:50.147 --> 27:51.881
There's room for two.

27:59.925 --> 28:02.493
Yes.

28:04.062 --> 28:06.063
Ah, here he is.
My lord.

28:06.131 --> 28:08.165
This is Mohammed.

28:08.233 --> 28:10.634
Mohammed?
Here in the Holy City?

28:10.735 --> 28:13.603
He can help you
ease your pain.

28:13.704 --> 28:15.238
Go with him.

28:15.305 --> 28:16.672
Trust him.

28:16.740 --> 28:19.241
All will be well.

28:19.342 --> 28:21.510
Doctor.

28:21.578 --> 28:23.712
Come, my friend.

28:23.780 --> 28:25.548
Please.

28:29.187 --> 28:30.720
Yalla.

28:39.031 --> 28:40.531
Almost there now.

28:40.633 --> 28:41.732
Come.

28:46.438 --> 28:47.805
Harrek.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.281
Salama Alaykum

29:04.389 --> 29:06.657
<i>Breathe in slow-</i>

29:06.725 --> 29:10.661
Here you will find
nothing but friends.

29:10.729 --> 29:13.196
What is it they're smoking?

29:13.264 --> 29:14.998
It is opium.

29:16.767 --> 29:19.836
When you cut the poppy,
it cries.

29:19.904 --> 29:21.638
Come.

29:21.739 --> 29:23.640
Join your new friends.

29:23.708 --> 29:26.110
Ease your pain.

29:50.769 --> 29:53.637
Poor, poor Benito Sforza.

29:55.473 --> 29:59.643
What is to be done
with you, boy?

29:59.711 --> 30:03.681
Washed up in Rome
like a stray dog.

30:05.885 --> 30:08.854
Should I kill you?

30:08.955 --> 30:11.824
Would it be a kindness
to put you down?

30:13.660 --> 30:15.829
Because I am my mother's son?

30:17.932 --> 30:20.233
Your mother
is a whore, boy.

30:22.502 --> 30:24.503
Reason enough,
I would say.

30:33.478 --> 30:37.481
My master summons you, boy.

30:37.548 --> 30:40.049
You have truths to tell.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.587
You are to come with me.

30:55.732 --> 30:57.599
To my death?

31:01.205 --> 31:03.706
Remains to be seen.

32:04.237 --> 32:05.337
Who are you?

32:05.405 --> 32:07.339
Holy Father,

32:07.407 --> 32:09.709
<i>I must speak with you.</i>

32:18.686 --> 32:20.454
I'm-

32:21.756 --> 32:23.089
I'm-

32:23.190 --> 32:25.625
Oh!

32:33.099 --> 32:36.534
What-
what have they done?

32:36.602 --> 32:38.436
Who are you?

32:38.504 --> 32:42.908
I am Benito Sforza,

32:42.975 --> 32:46.645
the son of Catherina Sforza,

32:46.713 --> 32:51.550
and I am here to tell you-

32:51.618 --> 32:58.659
I'm here to tell you
what truly happened

32:58.726 --> 33:01.928
at the Siege of Forli.

33:15.476 --> 33:17.043
My son!

33:19.179 --> 33:22.647
So late to bed?

33:22.749 --> 33:25.817
I'm a sleepwalker.

33:25.885 --> 33:29.587
This wound will
not let me rest.

33:29.655 --> 33:33.124
Is it your body or your
soul that needs healing?

33:36.862 --> 33:42.033
Your defeat at Forli
may be atoned for.

33:42.134 --> 33:44.669
We were betrayed, Father.

33:44.737 --> 33:47.139
Surely you must realize that?

33:47.240 --> 33:48.774
If I'd had word
of the attack,

33:48.875 --> 33:50.409
Catherina Sforza
would be-

33:50.477 --> 33:53.512
would be here now
in irons.

33:53.613 --> 33:55.882
And her son, Benito?

33:55.949 --> 34:00.119
Her son?
What of him?

34:00.187 --> 34:01.554
Ah!

34:01.622 --> 34:03.856
He's dead.

34:03.957 --> 34:05.924
A small consolation.

34:08.527 --> 34:11.129
Perhaps we should
suspend enmities.

34:11.230 --> 34:13.197
Regroup our forces.

34:13.264 --> 34:15.800
Until my leg is healed.

34:15.867 --> 34:17.668
Hm.
Find someone else

34:17.735 --> 34:20.404
to lead the papal
forces in your stead.

34:25.946 --> 34:27.679
I lead your armies.

34:27.748 --> 34:30.617
I defend this papacy,
I defend this family,

34:30.717 --> 34:33.254
with my heart and with my soul.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.589
Juan, in your condition

34:35.657 --> 34:40.328
you are in no fit state
to defend anything.

34:40.429 --> 34:42.530
Not even yourself.

34:47.402 --> 34:50.338
If you were to rob
my sword from me,

34:50.438 --> 34:54.775
my position, my respect,

34:54.844 --> 34:57.246
then there is a price to pay.

35:02.685 --> 35:07.455
If you take my honour,

35:11.260 --> 35:13.795
you must take my life.

35:13.862 --> 35:18.365
Mine to give, yours to take.

35:18.433 --> 35:21.169
Juan.

35:21.270 --> 35:26.173
Juan, you must sleep.

35:26.274 --> 35:28.008
I will sleep with the knowledge

35:28.075 --> 35:30.377
that my estate is secure.

35:32.412 --> 35:37.783
Your estate remains
in your hands.

35:42.857 --> 35:44.290
Now, come on.

35:55.971 --> 35:58.340
Go and rest.

36:25.403 --> 36:29.406
Boy, see to the horses!

36:29.473 --> 36:31.107
<i>I'll come back for the others.</i>

36:31.175 --> 36:33.043
Cardinal Borgia.

36:33.110 --> 36:34.711
His Holiness sends
this boy to you

36:34.779 --> 36:37.647
and charges you to return him
on your journey to Florence.

36:37.715 --> 36:39.583
To where?

36:39.650 --> 36:43.286
In his own words,
to the one who gave him life.

36:43.354 --> 36:44.955
His mother.

36:45.022 --> 36:47.490
What's this?

36:47.591 --> 36:49.859
It's from the Holy Father
himself.

36:49.926 --> 36:52.127
An olive branch
for my mother.

36:52.228 --> 36:53.662
Peace?

36:53.730 --> 36:55.196
An offering.

36:59.402 --> 37:01.036
Here.

37:08.011 --> 37:10.347
Cardinal.

37:26.264 --> 37:28.665
Lady Lucrezia.

37:28.733 --> 37:32.569
Raffaello Pallavicini da Genova.

37:32.637 --> 37:34.772
I see you have been drawing.

37:34.873 --> 37:38.275
Oh, um, some sketches,

37:38.342 --> 37:41.678
from the Roman ruins
on the Via Aurelia.

37:41.779 --> 37:44.048
I know it well.

37:47.019 --> 37:49.320
Oh, I think you have
dropped something.

37:49.421 --> 37:50.955
No, I think not.

37:51.023 --> 37:54.092
Oh, yes, believe me,
I saw you drop it.

37:54.159 --> 37:57.428
I think you had better
read it without delay.

39:05.667 --> 39:07.468
Drink.

39:22.451 --> 39:24.752
Lucrezia.

39:27.723 --> 39:31.092
Are you saying
yes to my brother?

39:31.159 --> 39:33.827
And I am saying yes to you.

39:40.301 --> 39:44.204
I'll say yes to your brother
to keep you here.

39:46.808 --> 39:50.177
Torrone morbido
or canditi.

39:50.244 --> 39:52.579
Which would you have?

39:54.482 --> 39:56.483
I like them both.

39:56.551 --> 39:58.351
Ah.

40:01.722 --> 40:03.856
So have both.

40:06.493 --> 40:08.293
Mm.

40:49.302 --> 41:01.980
[♪]

41:04.550 --> 41:14.058
[♪]

41:22.134 --> 41:35.648
[♪]

41:35.650 --> 41:44.956
[♪]

41:45.024 --> 41:48.326
<i>Fresh fish!</i>
<i>Fresh fish!</i>

41:48.394 --> 41:50.395
<i>Fish for Lent!</i>

41:59.937 --> 42:01.905
Keep up with me, boy.

42:20.926 --> 42:30.634
[♪]

42:47.483 --> 42:52.253
They say drowning
is like dreaming.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.355
Who is to know that?

42:54.423 --> 42:58.725
Whoever came back
from the dead to tell?

42:58.793 --> 43:02.562
Just give me the word,
Eminence, and it is done.

43:02.630 --> 43:06.166
<i>He carries</i>
<i>an olive branch.</i>

43:06.233 --> 43:09.735
And this would
bring peace?

43:09.803 --> 43:11.904
I doubt it.

43:11.972 --> 43:13.973
This boy is marked for life.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.208
He has the smell
of revenge about him.

43:16.309 --> 43:18.577
Let me kill him now

43:18.678 --> 43:22.381
and that is
an end to it.

43:22.482 --> 43:24.283
You may be right, but...

43:29.057 --> 43:31.024
Ready!

43:39.935 --> 43:43.471
I just offered to drown
you in that stream.

43:43.539 --> 43:47.108
My master said no.

43:47.209 --> 43:51.646
They say drowning
is like dreaming.

43:51.713 --> 43:55.382
And how do you know that?

43:55.483 --> 43:57.651
I heard you tell
your master.

44:05.127 --> 44:08.029
Sweet Lady Lucrezia,

44:08.097 --> 44:09.731
since my arrival here in Rome

44:09.799 --> 44:14.136
I have been captivated
by the Holy City

44:14.203 --> 44:16.404
whose beauty is only eclipsed

44:16.472 --> 44:19.941
by the beauty of the woman
I now see before me.

44:20.043 --> 44:23.045
Oh, so true.

44:23.146 --> 44:24.913
As heir to my father,

44:24.981 --> 44:27.115
Agostino Pallavicini
da Genova,

44:27.183 --> 44:32.054
this bark I present to you
is a symbol

44:32.121 --> 44:34.023
of the exotic
treasures and riches

44:34.091 --> 44:37.860
which our fleet of ships
carry from around the globe

44:37.928 --> 44:40.597
to our mighty port
of Genova.

44:40.698 --> 44:42.432
All that is mine,

44:42.534 --> 44:44.234
I now lay at your feet.

44:46.270 --> 44:47.971
Oh.

44:50.708 --> 44:55.446
We share a proud
Spanish heritage

44:55.514 --> 44:58.283
and I pray to the almighty
God who rules us all

44:58.350 --> 45:01.286
that you will accept
this offer of marriage

45:01.354 --> 45:03.955
and of a binding alliance
between our families

45:04.022 --> 45:06.223
against our common foes.

45:16.135 --> 45:18.069
I thank you.

45:19.605 --> 45:22.873
Then my answer is...

45:32.584 --> 45:35.452
Yes.

45:36.588 --> 45:38.956
All praise.

45:41.360 --> 45:44.463
This is an historic occasion.

45:44.530 --> 45:46.598
At last.

45:46.666 --> 45:50.036
You have brought
light into our lives.

45:50.103 --> 45:54.240
We thank the saints that
have given you this wisdom.

46:27.908 --> 46:33.347
You remember this moment
as an act of mercy.

46:50.699 --> 46:53.401
This dog will come
back and bite.

46:53.469 --> 46:56.538
What was it the Spaniard said?

46:56.605 --> 46:59.641
I fight men, not boys.

47:00.643 --> 47:04.012
<i>Open the gate!</i>

47:04.080 --> 47:05.480
<i>Summon Lady Sforza!</i>

47:05.548 --> 47:08.117
<i>Open the gate!</i>

47:13.524 --> 47:15.492
Bless you, little one.

47:26.638 --> 47:29.105
<i>You requested confession.</i>

47:29.173 --> 47:31.240
Yes.

47:31.342 --> 47:34.076
I confess I have sinned.

47:34.144 --> 47:36.879
<i>And what is the</i>
<i>nature of your sin?</i>

47:36.980 --> 47:38.947
You must know it, Cardinal.

47:39.048 --> 47:41.283
Or at least suspect.

47:41.351 --> 47:43.586
What could I suspect?

47:43.654 --> 47:45.354
Murder.

47:45.422 --> 47:48.458
I created a vacancy
in the papal household.

47:48.526 --> 47:50.961
I killed the one
I must replace.

47:51.029 --> 47:53.063
Brother Bernadino.

47:53.164 --> 47:54.965
My God.

47:55.066 --> 47:56.500
One gentle push

47:56.567 --> 47:58.602
while the good brother
<i>fished the river</i>

47:58.703 --> 48:00.404
was all that was needed.

48:04.576 --> 48:07.210
He struggled

48:07.278 --> 48:12.148
<i>but the weight of his</i>
<i>robes trapped him down.</i>

48:12.215 --> 48:14.617
God forgive us all.

48:14.685 --> 48:18.154
Am I fulfilling my mission,
<i>Cardinal?</i>

48:18.222 --> 48:21.057
More than one could
ever have hoped.
