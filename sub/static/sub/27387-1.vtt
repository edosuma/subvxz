00:20.488 --> 00:23.222
So you'll be
disoriented at first.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.291
- Just try and land on your feet.
- Okay.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.595
Now, once you're through,
find the lab.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.697
The technician there
will give you a ride to town.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.632
And things will be different?

00:33.634 --> 00:35.267
That's what you paid for.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.485
Okay.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.575
It's time for a new shirt.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.244
What's wrong with this shirt?

01:52.246 --> 01:54.646
It looks like a zombie
Halloween costume.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.381
I was wearing this
shirt when we met.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.851
And every day since then
by the looks of it.

01:58.853 --> 02:01.386
Sometimes a little change
can be a good thing.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.755
Babe, I have bad news for you.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.858
What's your bad news, babe?

02:05.860 --> 02:07.793
- I plan to be buried in this shirt.
- Oh.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.329
- Yeah.
- Well, then you better hope I die first.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.164
- Doesn't matter, it's in my will.
- Oh, yeah?

02:12.166 --> 02:13.866
- There's nothing you can do.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah?

02:13.868 --> 02:16.168
I have a top-notch
estate planner.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.436
- Oh, you do?
- I haven't told you about that?

02:17.438 --> 02:18.437
- No.
- His name's Wilfred.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.638
Shut up.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.906
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.142
- You shut up.
- Shut up.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.464
- You haven't told him yet?
- No.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.232
What are you waiting for?

02:47.234 --> 02:49.268
- He's not going to like it.
- Just tell him.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.569
Maybe he'll surprise you.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.471
Are we talking about
the same Todd?

02:52.473 --> 02:53.539
I mean.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.308
- Hey, babe.
- Mm.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.510
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, babe.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.547
- Dave wanted to show you something. Did he find you?
- Uh-oh, what?

03:01.549 --> 03:04.249
Probably a porno mag
or a really cool bug.

03:04.251 --> 03:07.653
- He's not that bad.
- No offense, but your brother is an overgrown man-child.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.655
Todd!

03:09.657 --> 03:10.889
Check this out, man.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.295
I mean, it is impressive.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.197
Is it, though?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.870
Hey. Hey. Let's go
to that new bar

03:24.872 --> 03:27.906
that they've got, they got the,
they got "Ghostbusters" pinball.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.409
- Man, that's a classic.
- Dude, it's late.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.778
Dude, it's not late, it's nine o'clock.
When was the last time we hung out?

03:32.780 --> 03:34.646
I feel like I haven't
seen Lucy in like a week.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.416
Lucy, tell you boyfriend to stop
being such an ass badger.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.718
Todd, stop being
such an ass badger.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.621
You know about my... it's a condition.
I can't help it.

03:42.623 --> 03:46.258
- What about you, Annie? Playing pinball?
- My name is Abby.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.359
And you're an idiot.

03:48.796 --> 03:49.796
And that's a no?

03:51.799 --> 03:55.601
- Oh, fuck, it was Abby, it was Abby.
- Are you all right to drive?

03:55.603 --> 03:58.437
- Yeah, I'm fine, of course I'm fine, yes.
- Say the alphabet backwards.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.572
- He can't say it forwards.
- All right, so touch your nose.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.940
- I'm fine.
- Touch your nose.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.609
- I'm...
- Touch your nose!

04:03.611 --> 04:05.377
Touch your nose. Okay.

04:05.379 --> 04:08.413
- Touched.
- All right, all right. Just be safe.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.950
Of course I'm going to be safe,
always. What about you?

04:11.952 --> 04:14.453
- Last chance for boys' night.
- Another time.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.322
All right,
well, don't be a stranger.

04:17.324 --> 04:18.523
Go to bed!

04:26.934 --> 04:32.404
So... There's
an opening at work.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.740
- Mm-hmm.
- It's the VP of marketing,

04:34.742 --> 04:37.409
and my boss says the job
is mine if I want it.

04:39.546 --> 04:40.546
That's amazing.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.682
It's in the Seattle office.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.586
Seattle, Washington?

04:49.423 --> 04:50.423
I want to go.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.393
Well, that's going to be
a hell of a commute, babe,

04:54.395 --> 04:56.962
but I mean, if you're committed

04:56.964 --> 04:58.463
I bet you could just,
you know, take...

04:58.465 --> 05:00.332
And I want you to come with me.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.773
You're being serious right now?

05:07.775 --> 05:08.775
Mm-hmm.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.610
I've never even been to Seattle.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.979
Well, you've never
really been anywhere

05:13.981 --> 05:15.414
outside of New England.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.948
That's my point.

05:16.950 --> 05:17.950
Mine, too.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.453
What?

05:21.455 --> 05:22.654
What are you thinking?

05:24.591 --> 05:25.857
I don't want to move.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.529
I like it here.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.897
I like the way things are.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.703
Why are you making that face?

05:37.705 --> 05:38.837
- What?
- I knew you would do this.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.105
Do what?

05:41.108 --> 05:43.742
Cop that bullshit
resistant attitude

05:43.744 --> 05:45.777
- you have all of the time.
- What?

05:45.779 --> 05:48.413
- You didn't even think about it.
- What do you want me to say?

05:48.415 --> 05:50.415
You want me to be
excited by the fact

05:50.417 --> 05:52.584
that my girlfriend is taking
a job across the country

05:52.586 --> 05:55.053
without even talking
to me about it?

05:55.055 --> 05:56.955
Fine, well, I'll pack
my bags tonight.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.925
Let's leave tonight
if that's what you want to do.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.494
Yeah, forget it.
Just forget I asked.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.631
What are you doing?

06:08.535 --> 06:09.801
Are you sleeping me out?

06:13.474 --> 06:14.673
Lucy.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.410
Lucy.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.061
And I'm like, "That's like, it
would be a really long commute"

06:36.063 --> 06:38.497
to go from Providence
to Seattle."

06:38.499 --> 06:40.832
And then all of a sudden, she's
like, "Well, yeah, I'm taking it."

06:40.834 --> 06:43.735
And I'm like, "what are
you talking about?"

06:43.737 --> 06:45.837
How could you take a job

06:45.839 --> 06:48.106
3,000 miles away without
talkin' to me about it?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.675
Hey, man, it sucks, okay.
But I told you, she does this.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.612
She does this all the time.
She doesn't stay put.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.047
She's a restless spirit, or
whatever the hell you want to...

06:58.852 --> 07:00.986
- You son of a bitch!
- I'm trying...

07:00.988 --> 07:03.889
- I'm asking for your help here.
- How? How, are you watching this?

07:03.891 --> 07:07.726
I need your help, I have no...
I don't know what to do.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.032
- What?
- Ever since the two of you got together,

07:14.034 --> 07:16.935
I've noticed a very steep
decline in us hanging out.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.771
What's with that, man? Like, oh,
you come by in the middle of the night.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.740
You want to complain about
my sister. Yeah, that's awesome.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.042
That's real fun, man.
We used to do things, man.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.611
When was the last
time we went fishing?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.014
- Never.
- I rest my case.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.618
You want to go fishing?
Is that what you want?

07:34.521 --> 07:35.070
Yeah.

07:35.071 --> 07:35.620
All right, man,
we'll go fishing.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.955
Good, I'm free Sunday.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.125
All right, dude.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.893
Thanks for your help.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.595
No problem, buddy.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.863
Sunday, right?

07:44.865 --> 07:47.532
We're going to do
this on Sunday?

07:47.534 --> 07:48.800
I need a yes.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.935
Yes.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.074
No!

09:26.800 --> 09:27.800
Luce?

09:31.738 --> 09:32.738
Lucy?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.013
Shit.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.655
Hey, Todd.

10:08.675 --> 10:09.874
Stop it!

10:13.647 --> 10:14.879
Who are you?

10:15.916 --> 10:17.082
I'm you.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.884
You're me?

10:20.921 --> 10:22.854
Well, you're me.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.359
But.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.628
But...

10:31.798 --> 10:33.898
But, but.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.100
You're me.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.735
I'm you.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.903
A slightly thinner you.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.238
Wait, what?

10:41.375 --> 10:43.975
Look, Todd, I have a problem.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.112
And I need your help.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.085
Wait.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.322
Wait, how is this possible?

10:59.726 --> 11:01.126
It doesn't matter.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.095
It'll all make sense soon.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.706
Okay.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.908
This is fuckin' weird.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.680
What's your problem?

11:23.984 --> 11:25.083
You.

13:17.531 --> 13:18.563
Hello?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.299
Lucy, hi.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.003
I miss you.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.005
Been like eight hours.

13:27.007 --> 13:30.074
No, I know.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.110
We should probably
talk when I get home.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.513
I'd like that.

13:36.550 --> 13:37.550
Really?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.853
More than anything.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.556
I love you.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.326
I love you, too.

16:14.040 --> 16:18.543
- What happened to you?
- Uh... I'm not sure exactly.

16:18.545 --> 16:23.181
I remember talking to myself,
which, that can't be right.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.552
You need to go to a hospital or?

16:27.554 --> 16:30.621
No, no, I just need to get home.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.523
Where's home?

16:32.525 --> 16:33.992
Providence.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.326
All right, hop in, guy.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.427
Thank you.

16:37.530 --> 16:41.599
It's not too far, I don't think.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.604
It's this one up
here on the right.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.644
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks again for the ride.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.114
Yeah, get that head checked out.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.762
Lucy.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.732
Lucy, I'm locked out.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.368
Yes?

17:18.271 --> 17:20.605
What are you doing in my house?

17:20.607 --> 17:22.707
- Your house?
- Well, yeah, it's...

17:24.676 --> 17:27.178
Hey!

17:27.180 --> 17:28.180
Hey!

17:30.550 --> 17:32.216
What the fuck is happening?

17:50.703 --> 17:52.570
Dave, thank God.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.472
You got to help me.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.774
Dave, come on.

17:56.776 --> 18:00.578
Something's goin' on here, man.
I talked to myself.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.414
Dave, I know it sounds crazy,
but there's another me.

18:03.416 --> 18:07.218
And now I don't live where
I live, and you have a,

18:07.220 --> 18:09.787
you have a mustache.
Why do you have a mustache?

18:09.789 --> 18:12.623
Dave, Dave, come on, man.
I need your help.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.560
Dave. Thank you.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.228
What'd you do to your head?

18:17.230 --> 18:18.750
- What?
- What did you do to your head?

18:20.567 --> 18:22.533
I think he hit me.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.870
- Who hit you?
- The other me, the other Todd.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.607
Something's goin' on here,
man, and I need your help.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.777
Thank you.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.783
- Ow, ow.
- Stop moving.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.451
Ow, I'm moving because
you're poking it.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.354
Yeah, well, I'm poking it
because you're moving.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.791
You know what? Do it yourself. I don't know
why you didn't just go to the hospital.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.695
Because I came here. Why am I getting
the sense that you don't want me here?

18:50.697 --> 18:53.164
- Really?
- Really.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.732
Todd, I'm not going to
rehash the past with you.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.901
Rehash what?
You are not making any sense.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.436
You haven't made
any sense since I got here.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.404
- I'm not making sense?
- Yes.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.173
I'm the one that's
not making sense.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.626
Yes.

19:05.627 --> 19:06.907
Maybe you should just go.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.414
Are you serious?

19:11.718 --> 19:12.750
You're serious.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.155
Fine.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.389
Just let me call Lucy.

19:20.527 --> 19:23.161
Now, how do you
intend to do that?

19:23.163 --> 19:25.796
With a phone, Dave.
A phone would work great.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.199
- Why are you doin' this?
- Doin' what?

19:28.201 --> 19:29.800
- Todd.
- Dave.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.873
- She's gone.
- She's gone? What?

19:35.875 --> 19:38.442
What do you mean she's gone?
She left for Seattle already?

19:38.444 --> 19:40.244
- What are you talking about?
- We just talked about it.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.547
She wouldn't have just
left for Seattle.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.349
Abby. What? Who's the kid?

19:52.792 --> 19:59.363
He's talkin' crazy. He said he wanted to
call Lucy. He thinks she's in Seattle.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.266
Well, obviously he's having some kind
of a mental break. He needs help.

20:02.268 --> 20:05.469
Abby, I have done
everything I could for him.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.738
- He needs to see a doctor.
- I agree with you.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.775
Is there a 24-hour mental
institution I can bring him to?

20:10.777 --> 20:12.243
Lucy would want us to.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.546
Oh, that is...

20:16.749 --> 20:18.616
that is so not fair.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.723
- What are you doing?
- I need today's newspaper.

20:25.725 --> 20:31.529
- Why?
- Because I think I've traveled through time.

20:31.531 --> 20:34.732
No, no, you have not.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.568
- Well, then explain to me what's goin' on.
- You hit your head.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.904
I hit my head,
and now you have a baby?

20:42.242 --> 20:43.441
Where's my baby, Dave?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.257
Hi.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.859
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.896
Yeah, I don't want to pretend
like nothing happened.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.601
Neither do I.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.771
I see that you're mad.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.009
And I get it.

21:18.811 --> 21:19.811
You do?

21:21.381 --> 21:22.880
Yes.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.015
Yes, I get it.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.351
You were right.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.854
Oh, you were right.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.922
You were right.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.525
About what?

21:35.695 --> 21:37.395
Hmm?

21:37.397 --> 21:38.663
Right about what?

21:40.300 --> 21:41.300
Everything.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.068
You were right about everything.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.004
Being?

21:49.309 --> 21:50.975
Wait, just,

21:50.977 --> 21:54.378
I need to be more supportive,

21:54.380 --> 21:56.447
- you know, and...
- No, that's not really the point.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.615
No, no, no, listen.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.584
I'm not being very eloquent.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.621
I am committed to you,

22:04.691 --> 22:05.923
100 percent.

22:07.060 --> 22:09.393
To us, to being together.

22:11.431 --> 22:14.098
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to be with you.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.950
All right, so what
about all the stuff

22:22.475 --> 22:24.125
you said last night?

22:24.126 --> 22:25.776
I wasn't myself
last night is the truth.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.346
So you'll come with me?

22:29.515 --> 22:31.615
Of course I'll go with you.

22:31.617 --> 22:32.817
Yeah?

22:34.520 --> 22:35.886
I'd go anywhere for you.

22:37.857 --> 22:38.857
Anywhere?

22:39.826 --> 22:40.958
You have no idea.

22:44.897 --> 22:48.532
- Come here.
- What are we doing?

22:48.534 --> 22:52.737
I don't know, I'm trying to
hold you and dance with you.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.609
So we're going to Seattle.

23:01.748 --> 23:04.682
Yes, Seattle.

23:04.684 --> 23:05.816
Yeah?

23:05.818 --> 23:08.452
Perfect, love Seattle.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.923
How many times do I have
to tell this story?

23:12.925 --> 23:14.759
Just one more time.

23:14.761 --> 23:18.596
And then other me
hit me with a frying pan.

23:18.598 --> 23:21.866
- Okay.
- And now Dave has a baby and a mustache.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.134
Mm-hmm.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.004
- I'm not crazy.
- You have a mild concussion.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.806
A little confusion
is totally normal.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.941
This goes well beyond confusion.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.710
Well, someone's going
to need to watch him

23:32.712 --> 23:34.412
over the next 24 hours.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.614
Can't I just have him committed?

23:36.616 --> 23:37.616
No.

23:40.553 --> 23:43.187
Look, Dave,
I'm not making this up, man.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.790
Dave, stop, listen.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.025
I'm not making this up.
There's something' wrong here.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.861
- I agree with you.
- I don't know what's goin' on, but there's something.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.563
Something' isn't right.

23:52.565 --> 23:53.798
I need your help here.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.501
- Okay.
- All right.

23:57.503 --> 24:00.204
So let me just use
your phone, and call Lucy

24:00.206 --> 24:03.207
- and find out what's goin' on.
- You can't call her.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.608
Why not?

24:05.745 --> 24:06.811
Because she's dead.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.747
Shut up, dude.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.149
- Three years, Todd.
- Stop it.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.618
- It's not funny.
- I know it's not funny.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.921
We've known each other
a long time, right?

24:17.824 --> 24:19.957
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so we should be able to tell

24:19.959 --> 24:22.526
when one of us is being serious?

24:22.528 --> 24:23.794
Yeah.

24:23.796 --> 24:28.199
Lucy has been dead
for two years.

24:28.201 --> 24:30.067
I just saw her.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.803
Look, I get it, you've got
head trauma from whatever.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.038
And you're still coping.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.739
I'm not coping!

24:35.741 --> 24:37.508
Right, sure, right.

24:39.212 --> 24:40.511
I need you to listen
to me, okay?

24:40.513 --> 24:43.013
Just... listen to me.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.084
There is no other you.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.954
Lucy's not in Seattle.

24:50.857 --> 24:54.658
She's gone. Okay?

24:55.828 --> 24:59.930
You've asked me for my help,
and I'm going to do whatever I can, but...

24:59.932 --> 25:02.099
But just consider the possible
that you might be wrong.

25:04.570 --> 25:05.636
That's it.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.072
This isn't right.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.574
I know.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.218
Let's get you home.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.993
Are you coming or what?

26:15.841 --> 26:17.975
Are you crying?

26:20.179 --> 26:23.280
Would that be weird?

26:24.717 --> 26:25.717
No.

26:44.337 --> 26:45.603
Awake already?

26:46.839 --> 26:47.839
Still.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.376
What about you?

26:53.846 --> 26:56.246
I always wake up
right before the baby.

27:05.725 --> 27:06.725
So?

27:09.195 --> 27:10.195
What's the deal?

27:12.798 --> 27:13.864
You crazy or what?

27:21.907 --> 27:25.309
She's not supposed to be dead.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.047
I know that feeling.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.418
Why don't you...

27:37.890 --> 27:39.923
why don't you tell me
what happened?

27:44.296 --> 27:46.063
I want to know what happened.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.102
All right.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.073
You guys fought.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.376
She went to go talk to Dave.

28:01.914 --> 28:04.715
Driving fast, it was dark.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.254
Ran off the road.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.125
You can find it on the highway.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.064
Dave was devastated.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.967
I mean, all of us were,
but not like you.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.972
You couldn't let it go.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.875
And we had to, you know?

28:35.081 --> 28:37.014
Dave hated seeing you like that.

28:39.018 --> 28:43.153
We'd all just lost Lucy,
didn't want to lose Todd.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.190
But you were way gone.

28:52.998 --> 28:53.998
Right on cue.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.306
- What's her name?
- Hmm?

29:02.308 --> 29:04.274
The baby,
what's the baby's name?

29:05.177 --> 29:06.410
I didn't even ask.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.246
Lucy.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.396
You're never up before me.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.967
I know, couldn't wait.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.870
Mm, where's this guy been?

29:33.773 --> 29:34.773
You feel skinny.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.008
Mimosas.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.219
We're moving to Seattle.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.522
- Both of you?
- That's a weird reaction.

29:51.524 --> 29:55.425
Right, uh, yeah. No, great,
great. That's great.

29:55.427 --> 29:58.328
- Babe, who is it?
- It's Dave.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.998
He didn't tell me you
guys were going fishing.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.001
Hey, dude, congrats.

30:05.271 --> 30:08.272
- Yeah, I didn't realize that you...
- Yeah.

30:08.274 --> 30:11.375
I think I'm going to spend
the day with Lucy today.

30:11.377 --> 30:14.845
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sure, great, great.

30:14.847 --> 30:18.549
- We'll see you soon.
- Meet us at the tavern later to celebrate.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.178
Todd?

30:49.281 --> 30:51.615
Do you want some dinner?

30:57.022 --> 31:00.891
- I don't think him staying here is such a good idea.
- Take him somewhere familiar.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.492
Maybe you can
snap him out of it.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.368
All right, buddy.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.504
- Come on.
- No, just leave me.

31:14.506 --> 31:18.041
No, come on. Come on,
we can't be on the floor.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.943
Come on.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.511
I got ya, I got ya.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.517
I'm not really
in the going out mood.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.486
Neither am I, but I can't have
you moping around the house

31:29.488 --> 31:31.588
making a bad example
for my daughter, so.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.024
Put something else on.
You look ridiculous.

31:57.182 --> 31:58.282
Hey, buddy.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.184
Cheer up, man.

32:01.186 --> 32:05.088
It's a special occasion.
This is supposed to be fun.

32:05.090 --> 32:09.159
Yeah, I mean,
like I said, congrats, man.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.129
You don't seem too happy for me.

32:12.131 --> 32:15.499
Oh, no, of course I'm happy.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.969
Come on.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.971
Let's have
a good night, all right?

32:27.046 --> 32:30.080
I mean, he's open,
he's romantic,

32:30.082 --> 32:34.251
and now we're going on this
whole new adventure together.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.686
See, I told you.

32:35.688 --> 32:37.154
You should always listen to me.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.122
It's like he's a whole new Todd.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.439
Remember that face
she used to make?

33:05.584 --> 33:07.351
I think it was more like a...

33:09.655 --> 33:13.490
She like,
turns her head and squints her eyes.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.059
- Kind of tightens up her lip.
- That's right.

33:16.061 --> 33:19.062
You always knew if she was
about to set you straight.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.099
Call that the Lucy face.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.037
I know how you feel, man.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.073
I don't think you do.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.375
Oh, I do.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.512
I could've been
a better brother.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.317
I didn't appreciate her
enough while she was here.

33:41.787 --> 33:45.789
All I cared about was
havin' a good time.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.328
I never really knew
what it was like

33:51.330 --> 33:53.263
to lose someone, you know?

33:55.100 --> 33:58.035
You wake up one morning
and everything's different,

33:58.037 --> 34:00.437
like you're in some
shitty parallel universe.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.809
But you can't go back.

34:05.811 --> 34:09.379
We can't hold on to what
things were like, you know?

34:10.549 --> 34:11.815
The sooner that you
come to grips

34:11.817 --> 34:13.417
- with that...
- Wait.

34:13.418 --> 34:14.418
What?

34:14.420 --> 34:15.619
What did you just say?

34:17.255 --> 34:18.722
We can't hold on to

34:19.625 --> 34:20.791
- how things used to be.
- No, no, no.

34:20.793 --> 34:21.824
Before that.

34:21.827 --> 34:25.695
- Things are different now?
- No, no, no, before that.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.598
Todd, I don't know,
what did I say?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.500
The parallel universe thing.

34:30.502 --> 34:34.204
- Todd, that was not the point of that.
- That's it.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.505
- No, Todd.
- I'm in a parallel universe.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.706
Stop it.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.442
- It all makes sense now.
- No.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.310
- Lucy...
- Stop it.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.777
Baby, and the mustache.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.813
Don't! Stop it.

34:43.815 --> 34:47.250
- Other me, he sent me here. He stole my girlfriend.
- Todd.

34:47.252 --> 34:51.455
- He stole my girlfriend.
- Stop being a crazy person.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.856
Don't you understand?

34:52.858 --> 34:54.357
I'm in the wrong universe!

34:55.260 --> 34:56.293
I got to go.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.630
- So when are you guys leaving?
- Two weeks.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.299
Aww. I still can't believe it.

35:02.301 --> 35:03.867
I'm going to miss you so much.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.802
They'll come back.
They always come back.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.239
- We'll see.
- Mm.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.774
Oh, we should have a toast.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.543
Right? That's appropriate.

35:14.680 --> 35:18.448
Todd, good buddy,
how long we been friends?

35:20.152 --> 35:22.185
Long, right? It's been long.

35:22.187 --> 35:26.356
And Lucy, I feel like, God,
I've known you your entire life.

35:27.626 --> 35:32.162
I wish I could say that I
approved of you guys from the beginning,

35:32.164 --> 35:34.264
but I would be lying.

35:35.734 --> 35:38.802
Todd, I think I even told you,
"Don't date my little sister."

35:38.804 --> 35:40.837
Not a joke.

35:42.341 --> 35:43.840
But you did.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.442
You did.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.711
And you're still doing it.

35:48.747 --> 35:54.251
No, you guys are great. I mean,
it's really hard to picture you guys apart,

35:54.253 --> 35:58.255
especially since it just
never happens anymore.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.191
You know?

36:00.759 --> 36:03.760
So, hey, to Todd and Lucy.

36:03.762 --> 36:07.264
Who needs friends
when ya have each other?

36:10.836 --> 36:11.868
Excuse me.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.707
Talk to you outside for a sec?

36:17.709 --> 36:18.709
Nope.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.644
Nope.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.750
- What was that about?
- Speakin' my truth, man.

36:26.752 --> 36:30.187
- This is important to her.
- What about what's important to me?

36:30.189 --> 36:32.822
It's like you don't remember
anything we talked about.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.758
What did we talk about?

36:34.760 --> 36:36.793
Maybe how your
relationship to my sister

36:36.795 --> 36:39.763
seems to be more important
than our friendship.

36:39.765 --> 36:41.431
It is, Dave.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.433
What is this?

36:43.569 --> 36:45.268
This isn't you.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.670
This is not you.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.871
Classic Dave.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.774
Always looking after
your own needs.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.610
I thought you'd be different.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.280
What do you mean, "Different?"

36:57.282 --> 36:58.282
From what?

37:16.468 --> 37:17.834
What's this?

37:17.836 --> 37:19.603
This is your apartment.

37:19.605 --> 37:22.806
Maybe other me's apartment,
but it's not mine.

37:22.808 --> 37:25.375
I'm going to tell you now
what I told you then, okay?

37:25.377 --> 37:29.346
If you can't let her go,
I can't do this anymore.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.249
She's not dead.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.487
Dave, come on.

37:38.657 --> 37:39.657
Dave.

37:45.998 --> 37:47.631
I'm sorry about your Lucy.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.774
Which one is it?

37:59.044 --> 38:00.044
103.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.397
Hello?

39:29.935 --> 39:31.067
I knew it.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.653
I mean, if he was
that upset about it,

39:50.655 --> 39:53.757
I don't know why he wouldn't
just say something.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.492
Did he say something to you?

39:56.962 --> 39:58.528
- Todd?
- Huh?

39:58.530 --> 40:00.463
Has Dave ever said
anything about this

40:00.465 --> 40:02.432
before tonight's
lovely little speech?

40:02.434 --> 40:05.802
I think he might just be
upset about the fishing trip.

40:06.638 --> 40:07.971
You know, you could have gone.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.539
You didn't have to stay here.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.909
What?

40:12.911 --> 40:14.711
I don't want to get
Dave in trouble.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.146
Tell me.

40:16.148 --> 40:17.947
- No, I...
- Just tell me.

40:22.654 --> 40:23.654
Okay.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.495
This is really hard to say.

40:34.065 --> 40:37.634
Dave told me that
I had to let you go

40:38.470 --> 40:41.805
if we're going to continue to
be friends, is how he put it.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.574
I mean...

40:45.977 --> 40:47.577
he wouldn't say that.

40:54.986 --> 40:55.986
She's asleep.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.023
Okay.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.026
What?

41:07.732 --> 41:08.732
No.

41:14.088 --> 41:15.938
I've tried with him.
You know I've tried.

41:19.110 --> 41:22.111
All right, but things are different.
And he needs to learn, okay?

41:22.113 --> 41:24.914
He needs to understand
and he needs to accept it.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.018
Why are you staring at me?

41:30.489 --> 41:32.755
I'm not the problem.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.593
Yeah, fine,
I wasn't there for him.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.961
But he wasn't there for me.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.564
Why do I have to be
the better friend?

41:41.566 --> 41:43.233
No.

41:44.636 --> 41:46.503
You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

41:46.505 --> 41:48.004
No, this isn't fair.

41:50.208 --> 41:54.110
Okay, look, I know
that he came for help.

41:54.112 --> 41:56.813
And I just, I pushed him away.
I get it, I know all this.

41:56.815 --> 41:59.649
I know all this, I know it.
I know, I know, I know.

41:59.651 --> 42:00.783
No.

42:00.785 --> 42:01.951
Nope.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.525
Fine!

42:08.527 --> 42:11.261
Oh, God, you are so...

42:12.297 --> 42:14.631
I hate when you're right.

42:37.822 --> 42:38.855
Hi.

42:39.724 --> 42:40.957
I miss you.

42:40.959 --> 42:41.959
I know.

42:43.995 --> 42:46.596
- Do you miss me?
- I don't even know you're gone.

42:48.099 --> 42:49.065
It's strange here.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.900
I don't like it.

42:50.902 --> 42:52.969
It's not that different.

42:52.971 --> 42:57.240
Yes, it is. Dave's got
a mustache, and you're dead.

42:57.242 --> 42:58.274
Well, that sucks.

43:00.679 --> 43:02.612
You know, it's funny.

43:02.614 --> 43:05.982
You were so scared about going
to another state with me,

43:05.984 --> 43:09.852
and now here you are, stuck in
another universe without me.

43:11.656 --> 43:14.257
- It's not funny.
- It is when you think about it.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.159
I'm thinkin' about it,
and it's not funny.

43:16.161 --> 43:17.860
It is funny.

43:19.998 --> 43:21.831
You want to make out?
We probably shouldn't.

43:21.833 --> 43:23.633
Someone's breaking in.

43:23.635 --> 43:24.701
- What?
- Hide.

43:53.031 --> 43:54.063
Fuck.

44:05.043 --> 44:06.876
Wait, wait, wait!

44:06.878 --> 44:08.778
- Where is it?
- Wait, where, what?

44:08.780 --> 44:11.214
- Where the fuck is it?
- I don't even know what it is.

44:11.216 --> 44:12.782
My lab, you asshole.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.684
- What?
- What did you do with it?

44:14.686 --> 44:15.952
Wait a minute, you're the...

44:17.422 --> 44:21.357
- Where is it?
- It wasn't me, it was him.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.426
It was other me.

44:23.428 --> 44:25.762
I'm going to count to three.

44:25.764 --> 44:27.997
One, two...

44:33.004 --> 44:35.138
Who is this guy?

44:36.374 --> 44:38.708
Todd, what the hell?

44:41.079 --> 44:43.813
What? Dave, what are you doing?

44:43.815 --> 44:45.314
- I'm calling the police.
- No, no, no.

44:45.316 --> 44:47.350
I think I need this
guy to get back.

44:48.386 --> 44:49.752
Just hear me out, man.

44:50.722 --> 44:51.954
Please.

44:54.359 --> 44:56.926
Other me followed him

44:56.928 --> 45:00.329
and his machine for months,

45:00.331 --> 45:03.700
just so he could take
my place and send me back here.

45:03.702 --> 45:05.368
It makes perfect sense.

45:05.370 --> 45:07.003
And you know what
the most fucked up thing is?

45:07.005 --> 45:09.038
- I don't.
- Other me stole it

45:09.040 --> 45:11.974
just so, I don't know,
so no one would follow him.

45:13.044 --> 45:16.846
And now this
guy wants to kill me.

45:18.083 --> 45:21.851
That was supposed to make me
think you're not crazy.

45:22.921 --> 45:24.987
This guy has some sort of

45:24.989 --> 45:28.191
interdimensionary
motor-home thingy.

45:28.193 --> 45:29.892
All we have do is find out

45:29.894 --> 45:34.297
where this other me,
the other Todd, put it.

45:34.299 --> 45:36.265
- Dude.
- I'm beggin' you here, man.

45:37.102 --> 45:42.004
Please, just consider
the possibility

45:42.006 --> 45:43.940
that I might be right.

45:43.942 --> 45:46.776
You honestly believe this?

45:46.778 --> 45:47.877
Yes.

45:47.879 --> 45:48.879
I really do.

45:54.486 --> 45:55.486
Okay.

45:56.354 --> 45:58.421
Okay. I mean...

45:59.824 --> 46:01.424
I guess it can't hurt to look.

46:01.426 --> 46:03.159
Thank you.

46:03.161 --> 46:05.495
- Thank you.
- But if we don't find it,

46:05.497 --> 46:09.165
or if we do and it's some
retired couple's vacation home,

46:10.468 --> 46:13.102
that's it, okay?

46:13.104 --> 46:16.072
We're done, and you
have to accept it.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.175
Okay, all right.

46:21.513 --> 46:23.479
What about him?

46:23.481 --> 46:25.181
What?

46:25.183 --> 46:26.949
We can't leave him here.

46:54.078 --> 46:56.078
What are you doing?

46:56.080 --> 46:59.315
- Keeping an eye on Todd.
- So you're following him.

46:59.317 --> 47:01.984
He's acting different. Don't
tell me you haven't noticed.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.586
I have.

47:03.588 --> 47:04.588
He's not himself.

47:05.390 --> 47:07.490
Yeah, he's mad you, dummy.

47:07.492 --> 47:09.826
And you know, honestly,
I'm a little mad, too.

47:09.828 --> 47:13.062
Okay, so last night, that
didn't really come out right.

47:13.064 --> 47:16.132
Did you tell him that
he had to let me go

47:16.134 --> 47:17.967
or you wouldn't be
friends with him anymore?

47:17.969 --> 47:19.168
No, I didn't say...

47:20.238 --> 47:22.271
- I didn't say exactly that.
- Mm-hmm.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.608
Look, I don't want
you to move either.

47:25.610 --> 47:27.944
I know better than to try to
talk you out of doing anything,

47:27.946 --> 47:30.046
and I just don't want
to lose Todd too.

47:31.216 --> 47:33.349
Dave, no one's dying.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.484
We're just going to be
six hours away by plane.

47:35.486 --> 47:37.920
I know, that is just like you.

47:38.890 --> 47:40.423
You just come in here and you
steal my friend away from me.

47:40.425 --> 47:42.425
Oh, my God, okay, that
is not what's happening.

47:42.427 --> 47:44.360
Then why is he acting weird?

47:44.362 --> 47:47.029
Maybe try taking a good
look at yourself for once,

47:47.031 --> 47:48.865
and stop staking out my house.

47:48.867 --> 47:51.601
No. Something's up.

47:51.603 --> 47:54.070
I need you to leave.

47:54.072 --> 47:55.071
- Dude.
- Dave.

47:55.073 --> 47:56.939
- Luce.
- Dave.

47:58.109 --> 47:59.475
I am so mad at you right now.

47:59.477 --> 48:01.477
- Fine.
- I'm telling mom.

48:01.479 --> 48:02.479
Go ahead.

48:36.214 --> 48:37.980
What are you doing
all the way out there?

48:37.982 --> 48:40.216
- <i>Looking for an RV.</i>
- What RV?

48:40.218 --> 48:42.685
- Why?
- He says it can send him...

48:45.089 --> 48:47.623
send him back to
his own universe.

48:49.093 --> 48:52.929
This is not what I had in mind
when I said he needed help.

48:52.931 --> 48:54.997
Look, some stuff has happened.

48:54.999 --> 48:57.166
I don't know.
What if this is true?

48:57.168 --> 48:59.669
- Dave.
- I know, I know, it's just...

49:02.307 --> 49:04.307
God, God, he really
believes this.

49:05.610 --> 49:09.578
I mean, come on. If I woke up
one morning and you were gone,

49:09.580 --> 49:11.380
I'd want my best friend's help.

49:14.052 --> 49:15.551
Abby?

49:15.553 --> 49:19.689
Are you silently admiring
what a great friend I am?

49:21.426 --> 49:24.593
Yeah, something' like that.

49:27.498 --> 49:28.965
Where to next?

49:28.967 --> 49:30.599
I don't know, it's this map.

49:30.601 --> 49:33.235
Do you think this is
a road or a coffee stand?

49:44.215 --> 49:45.448
Dude.

49:46.317 --> 49:48.617
You son of a bitch!

49:48.619 --> 49:49.752
Damn it.

49:59.230 --> 50:00.763
He looks mad.

50:00.765 --> 50:03.599
Yeah, he... yeah. Mm-hmm.

50:03.601 --> 50:07.370
- Maybe you should talk to him.
- No, I'm good.

50:07.372 --> 50:08.371
All right,
maybe I'll talk to him.

50:08.373 --> 50:10.106
Yes, absolutely, do that.

50:17.181 --> 50:19.515
Just give me two seconds.
Just hear me out.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.652
All right?

50:25.056 --> 50:26.589
What I was trying
to say before was,

50:26.591 --> 50:29.725
I'm not the Todd you're
lookin' for, all right?

50:29.727 --> 50:32.194
Other Todd stole your
motor home, not me.

50:32.196 --> 50:34.463
This other Todd, all right?

50:35.433 --> 50:38.200
He sent me here so
he could steal my girlfriend.

50:38.202 --> 50:42.471
But, well, I was a jerk to her.

50:42.473 --> 50:44.473
And I have to get back.

50:45.643 --> 50:48.044
All right? So we're
looking for your lab.

50:48.046 --> 50:50.579
And once we find it,
which we will, right, Dave?

50:50.581 --> 50:53.616
Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah, yes, yes. Absolutely.

50:53.618 --> 50:55.718
Then maybe we could untie you.

50:55.720 --> 50:58.521
And then you could
shoot me back.

50:59.757 --> 51:01.223
I wouldn't.

51:01.225 --> 51:03.059
What do you mean?

51:03.061 --> 51:05.227
Well, if you untie me,
I have to kill the both of you.

51:05.229 --> 51:06.595
So I wouldn't.

52:41.526 --> 52:42.858
- Hello?
- Did you get my message?

52:42.860 --> 52:44.593
- No.
<i>- What about my text?</i>

52:44.595 --> 52:46.395
- No.
- I sent you an email.

52:46.397 --> 52:47.897
- Dave, what is it?
<i>- Todd didn't go to work today.</i>

52:47.899 --> 52:50.266
He's just been walkin'
around all day.

52:50.268 --> 52:51.567
Did you follow him

52:51.569 --> 52:53.769
after I specifically
told you not to?

52:53.771 --> 52:57.373
- When have you ever known Todd to play hooky?
- Shouldn't you be at work?

52:57.375 --> 53:00.709
Now he's just sittin' at this
restaurant, with flowers.

53:00.711 --> 53:03.412
Luce, I think
he's havin' an affair.

53:03.414 --> 53:04.547
I mean, that would
explain all the...

53:04.549 --> 53:06.916
Dave, I am meeting him there.

53:06.918 --> 53:09.518
- Oh.
- Okay, just go home.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.288
<i>This is getting ridiculous.</i>

53:12.290 --> 53:14.223
- Oh, shit.
<i>- What?</i>

53:15.560 --> 53:16.792
Dave?

53:17.762 --> 53:18.762
Dave?

53:21.499 --> 53:22.631
Hey!

53:28.472 --> 53:31.240
- Hey!
- Whoa, hey, buddy.

53:31.242 --> 53:33.309
- Why are you following me?
- What? No, what?

53:33.311 --> 53:35.377
Just a coincidence.

53:35.379 --> 53:36.478
Twice in one day?

53:36.480 --> 53:37.680
Yes.

53:38.649 --> 53:39.882
Why are you following me?

53:40.785 --> 53:42.418
Something's up with you, man.

53:42.420 --> 53:45.287
You're acting different,
way different.

53:45.923 --> 53:47.890
People don't just
change over night.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.359
Something's up, and I'm going
to figure out what it is.

53:50.361 --> 53:52.328
Stay away from me!

53:52.330 --> 53:53.896
- I'm going to figure out what's going on.
- You don't understand.

53:53.898 --> 53:56.565
I don't understand.

53:57.602 --> 53:59.368
- Todd!
- See, Todd wouldn't do this,

53:59.370 --> 54:01.804
- you son of a bitch.
- Todd, what the hell?

54:01.806 --> 54:03.639
What are you doing?

54:03.641 --> 54:04.707
Dave, Dave!

54:06.811 --> 54:08.277
What is your deal?

54:08.279 --> 54:09.279
He started it.

54:10.314 --> 54:11.347
Dave?

54:27.598 --> 54:28.731
Wake up.

54:31.702 --> 54:33.302
What is this?

54:34.038 --> 54:35.738
It's a junkyard, you idiot.

54:36.641 --> 54:39.742
I thought it might be a good
place to find the motor home.

54:54.659 --> 54:56.292
Hey, man.

54:56.294 --> 54:57.826
I got to go to the bathroom.

55:00.798 --> 55:01.931
You're kidding?

55:01.932 --> 55:03.065
- Right now?
- No, not right now.

55:03.067 --> 55:05.301
If you want, I can turn the
back seat into a porta potti,

55:05.303 --> 55:07.803
- and then we can go.
- Nope, nope, we'll go.

55:07.805 --> 55:09.405
We'll go.

55:21.052 --> 55:22.618
So, um...

55:23.621 --> 55:24.720
is this real?

55:25.556 --> 55:26.955
What?

55:26.957 --> 55:30.559
Are you a parallel universe guy?

55:34.699 --> 55:36.932
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

55:36.934 --> 55:39.568
Well, that whole,
the motor home and Todd and...

55:39.570 --> 55:41.637
You mean my fucking house?

55:42.940 --> 55:44.940
Your little buddy over
there stole it from me,

55:44.942 --> 55:47.376
which is grand theft auto,
my friend.

55:48.646 --> 55:51.513
I mean, come on,
you didn't actually believe

55:51.515 --> 55:53.882
that crazy story
he cooked up, did you?

55:55.453 --> 55:56.418
No.

55:56.420 --> 56:01.090
You ask me, your friend
is absolutely nuts.

56:20.044 --> 56:23.412
Look, I am not trying
to excuse his behavior,

56:23.414 --> 56:26.448
but maybe if you
made the first move,

56:26.450 --> 56:27.883
you guys could bury the hatchet.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.486
- He started it.
- We are leaving very soon.

56:30.488 --> 56:34.656
And I just... can't we just go
back to the way things were?

56:35.693 --> 56:37.926
- I don't think that's going to be possible.
- Why not?

56:37.928 --> 56:39.795
- I have a theory.
- What's your theory?

56:39.797 --> 56:41.397
- You're not going to like it.
- What's your theory, Dave?

56:41.399 --> 56:43.031
I don't think that's Todd.

56:44.502 --> 56:45.567
What?

56:45.569 --> 56:47.169
That's as far as I got.

56:47.171 --> 56:50.038
Oh, God, you worry me
so very much.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.507
He's skipping work.

56:51.509 --> 56:53.909
He's attacking friends, me.

56:54.812 --> 56:56.945
He's moving.

56:56.947 --> 56:59.748
Lucy, he's moving. Todd has
never been west of Connecticut,

56:59.750 --> 57:01.850
and that was just over
the border and by accident.

57:01.852 --> 57:03.619
That is not Todd.

57:03.621 --> 57:05.454
- This was a mistake.
- No, no, no, no.

57:05.456 --> 57:07.756
No, no. I have known him
way longer than you have.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.691
That is not Todd, not Todd!

57:09.693 --> 57:12.761
- You can't be serious.
- I am 100 percent serious.

57:12.763 --> 57:15.164
Test him if you don't believe me.

57:15.166 --> 57:17.733
- Ask him something only Todd would know.
- That's crazy.

57:17.735 --> 57:19.001
- You'll see.
- You're crazy.

57:19.003 --> 57:20.903
I am not crazy.

57:22.173 --> 57:23.639
I'm not crazy.

57:27.778 --> 57:30.212
All right, I got a good
feelin' about this.

57:30.214 --> 57:31.847
Yeah, maybe we
should just call it.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.482
I just need a little more time.

57:33.484 --> 57:35.951
Todd, we've been at this
all day and all night.

57:35.953 --> 57:39.455
We can't look in every literal
junk pile in the state.

57:39.457 --> 57:42.491
We can, I just, I just
need a little more time.

57:43.494 --> 57:45.727
- I asked him.
- What?

57:45.729 --> 57:49.031
He says he has no idea
what you're talking about.

57:49.033 --> 57:51.533
And you believed him?
Are you serious?

57:51.535 --> 57:53.869
Todd, let's just drop
him off some place.

57:54.772 --> 57:58.140
Come back home with me.
You can stay with Abby and I for a while.

57:58.142 --> 58:00.108
- We'll get this all sorted out.
- What? No.

58:00.110 --> 58:02.044
- Dude.
- No!

58:04.048 --> 58:05.048
Get in the car.

58:06.050 --> 58:07.749
I want to show you something.

58:12.256 --> 58:13.755
Fine.

58:23.667 --> 58:25.734
- Where were you?
- I was at Dave's,

58:25.736 --> 58:28.504
to apologize for my boyfriend,
who, quite frankly,

58:28.506 --> 58:31.173
has been acting more than
a little crazy lately.

58:31.175 --> 58:35.811
And you know,
maybe I'm partly to blame.

58:35.813 --> 58:37.212
I know I sprung
this move on you,

58:37.214 --> 58:38.881
and I was a little rigid.

58:38.883 --> 58:40.749
But you know,
that is not an excuse

58:40.751 --> 58:42.117
to go full-tilt nutso on me.

58:42.119 --> 58:43.185
You're right.

58:43.187 --> 58:44.586
I am.

58:45.956 --> 58:49.057
No, I mean, you're right.

58:49.059 --> 58:50.659
I haven't been fair to Dave.

58:50.661 --> 58:52.227
You've been an asshole to Dave.

58:52.229 --> 58:54.263
I've been a huge,
flaming asshole to Dave.

58:54.265 --> 58:57.099
Yeah, and now
he's got all these ideas

58:57.101 --> 58:59.234
about you not being you and...

59:01.238 --> 59:03.705
Look, I don't even
know what that means.

59:03.707 --> 59:06.909
Tomorrow, I'm going
to go talk to him,

59:06.911 --> 59:08.110
and I'm going to
set things right.

59:08.112 --> 59:10.145
Because we're leaving,

59:10.147 --> 59:12.714
and I want to
leave on the right foot.

59:12.716 --> 59:15.284
- Because you're right.
- Yeah, look...

59:17.221 --> 59:19.655
I appreciate everything
you've been doing

59:19.657 --> 59:20.923
and how hard you've
been working,

59:20.925 --> 59:23.091
but just...

59:23.093 --> 59:25.994
Don't go changing
completely on me, okay?

59:25.996 --> 59:27.062
You got it.

59:29.567 --> 59:31.333
- Let's go to bed.
- Yeah.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:12.074
I believe that this
is real for you,

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:15.978
but you have to try to face
the world without her.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:21.284
I can't.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:33.962
Come on.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:59.154
Holy shit.

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.057
Holy shit, holy shit.

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:03.059
Holy shit.

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:09.832
Holy shit!

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:12.100
We found it.

01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:13.301
Holy shit.

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.307
Holy shit.

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:27.116
Dude.

01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:30.318
Get the guy.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.920
You believe me now?

01:01:31.922 --> 01:01:34.122
This is either
the most elaborate prank

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:36.758
in history of ever
or you were tellin' the truth.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.362
Either way,
I got to see how this turns out.

01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:00.782
It wasn't fair to you.

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:02.851
I don't know what got over me.

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:09.024
I think I was just
under a lot of pressure,

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:12.794
thinking that I'd lost Lucy.

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:14.362
But I've come to my senses now,

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:16.264
and I, really,
I want to apologize.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:18.033
I wasn't treating you like
a friend should treat a person.

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:19.367
And for that, I'm sorry.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:23.505
Well, I probably shouldn't have
been following you anyway.

01:02:23.507 --> 01:02:25.307
That is true.

01:02:28.479 --> 01:02:30.112
Why don't we put this
whole thing behind us?

01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:32.013
I think that's a good idea.

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:36.084
Buddy.

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:41.156
You know, for a while there, I was afraid this
was going to turn out just like Montreal.

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.091
Yeah, but it's all good, man.

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:48.964
- Did you ever find your passport?
- Yeah.

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:50.866
Yeah? Where was it?

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:52.267
It was in my bag the whole time.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:54.402
- No shit.
- The entire time.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:55.470
Really?

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:57.072
You were so mad.

01:02:57.074 --> 01:02:59.307
I know. I know.

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:01.042
I was wrong about that, too.

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:04.479
I've never been to Montreal.

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.814
And neither have you.

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:18.860
I want to let it go, Dave.

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:22.063
But you just had
to have it your way.

01:03:24.868 --> 01:03:26.268
The funny thing is...

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:31.439
Is that the Dave I know would have
never put up such a fuss over me.

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:37.846
What'd you say to Lucy?

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:40.849
I told her you're not Todd.

01:03:40.851 --> 01:03:42.017
What?

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:45.086
I told her that you're not Todd!

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:51.193
I told her that you're not Todd.

01:03:51.195 --> 01:03:52.160
But I am Todd.

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:56.298
And I'm a better Todd for her
than your Todd ever was.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.099
Except you're an insane person.

01:03:58.101 --> 01:04:01.903
I really wish
people would stop saying that.

01:04:01.905 --> 01:04:03.405
I'm not an insane person.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.041
I did this for her.

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:10.478
I did this because I love her.

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:14.182
What did you do with him?

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:17.252
I think he's fine.

01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:20.922
But... the bigger
problem here is,

01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:23.091
I can't have you messin'
things up for me

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:28.330
and Lucy... here.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.468
Tell her there was
a misunderstanding,

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:37.138
and that we worked it all out
and nothing else.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.987
<i>Hey, Lucy, it's Dave.</i>

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:55.657
<i>Just wanted to call to tell you
that, you know, Todd came by.</i>

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:59.127
<i>We worked it all out. It was
just a big misunderstanding.</i>

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:02.063
<i>So if I don't see you
before you go,</i>

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.598
<i>you know, have a great tri...</i>

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.575
<i>Hey, it's Dave, uh,</i>

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:14.676
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:33.461
Fuck. Hey, hey, baby.

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:35.530
- Hey, Todd.
- Hi, everything's, uh,

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:37.632
everything's good, just a little...

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.301
- Wait, wait.
- Have you heard from Dave? <i>-Busy right now, let me,</i>

01:05:39.303 --> 01:05:40.635
let me call you back.

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:49.711
- All right, come on.
- Hey, tut-tut, tut-tut, tut-tut.

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:52.147
What is this?
What are you doin' here?

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:55.083
- Look, I need this guy sent out now. I have cash.
- Oh, you have cash.

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:57.485
- I haven't caught a jumper in days.
- A what?

01:05:57.487 --> 01:06:00.555
You show up wanting your
double gone, which is fine.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:02.691
I don't know your life,
it's none of my business.

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:05.427
But ever since then, I haven't
had anyone come through.

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:09.464
And personally, I think you
had something' to do with it.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:10.498
Hey!

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:12.701
Ow!

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.441
How many times am I going
to have to do this?

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.415
God damn it.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:29.284
- It was the other Todd.
- He stole your lab.

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:31.586
I wouldn't steal from you.
I would never steal from you.

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:35.090
Do you think I don't hear this
bullshit excuse all the time?

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:36.558
It wasn't me,
it was the other me.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.160
But you've got the wrong Todd.
Listen to me.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:42.330
It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter,
because now I have to kill you.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.100
- No, you don't.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I do.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:47.268
No, no, you don't.

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.170
I don't want to argue
about this, all right.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:50.672
Come on, outside. Blood's bad

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.540
- for the machines.
- You don't have to kill us.

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:54.342
- Yes, I do.
- No, listen to me. Just listen to me.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.244
- Sorry I got us into this, man.
- No, it's my fault.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:58.713
If I had just helped you instead
of telling you to move on.

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:01.116
It's not your fault. I'm sorry, I
just, I wanted to get back to Lucy.

01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:02.684
Oh, God, shut up. Who's first?

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:04.619
- I was being selfish.
- I'm the selfish one.

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:08.156
- Ah, to hell with it, mustache!
- Wait a minute, Dave has a baby!

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.292
Jesus.

01:07:11.294 --> 01:07:13.261
Why'd you tell me that, hmm?

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:16.131
Why? Now I got to think
about his kid's face

01:07:16.133 --> 01:07:17.799
- while I bash his skull in.
- Let Todd go!

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:19.367
He's not the one you want.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:24.172
Guy, I'm not lettin' anybody go!

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:25.807
The Todd that stole your lab,
he's still out there.

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:29.144
And like I told you before,
I don't believe you.

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:30.712
- So...
- But what if it's true?!

01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:33.381
He's still out there.

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:35.784
He thinks he got away with it.

01:07:35.786 --> 01:07:38.253
I mean, he's laughing at you.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:42.390
Why take the risk, right?

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.461
Send him back.
He'll get other Todd for you.

01:07:46.463 --> 01:07:49.097
I'll stay as collateral.

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:50.732
Dave.

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:52.300
He thinks he won.

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:57.739
Don't you just want
to smash his stupid face in?

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.774
- Dave.
- Shut up.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:01.242
So you're willin'
to bet your life

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.111
that he doesn't just disappear?

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:06.514
He wouldn't do that.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.493
All right, back inside.

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:19.594
- What?
- What?

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:22.596
You want to go back or not?

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:41.216
You shouldn't have done that.

01:08:41.218 --> 01:08:43.318
Well, if I didn't we'd
both be dead, so save it.

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.886
What if I can't send him back?

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.154
There's always plan B.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.292
- You're the man.
- I am the man.

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:54.696
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:58.133
Come on.

01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:02.738
Don't move.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.339
And you,
you've got 'til sundown.

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:06.541
Or else. [IMITATES

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:10.845
Hey.

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.648
Say hi to Lucy for me.

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:27.388
What?

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:28.690
Low power?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.233
Yes, yes.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:40.236
Don't move.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.739
<i>It was just
a big misunderstanding.</i>

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:47.976
<i>So, um, if I don't see you
before you go, you know,</i>

01:10:47.978 --> 01:10:49.310
<i>have a great tri...</i>

01:10:50.947 --> 01:10:52.580
It sounds normal to me.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.582
Yeah, but the way that it
just ends, and his tone.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:55.650
His tone is weird.

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.319
I don't know him very well,

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:00.321
but based on his behavior
the other night?

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:01.723
Yeah, but that wasn't like him.

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:03.024
Something was going on.

01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:05.627
Yeah, maybe.

01:11:05.629 --> 01:11:06.961
No, I mean, yeah.

01:11:06.963 --> 01:11:08.863
But, look...

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:12.600
Dave has this theory

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:17.605
that Todd isn't Todd.

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.041
That it's an impostor.

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:26.514
Lucy, that's ridiculous.

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:27.582
Who else could it be?

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:28.850
I don't know, but...

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.487
something is different.
Todd is different.

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:33.955
I thought that was a good thing.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:35.490
It is.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:36.758
I mean, it was, but...

01:11:39.396 --> 01:11:40.695
something just isn't right.

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:11.392
Hey.

01:12:11.394 --> 01:12:13.428
Well, I'm going to go.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:18.032
It was nice to see you, Todd.

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:19.701
It was nice to see you, too.

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:25.541
Hey, babe.

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:27.942
How are ya?

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:29.977
How'd it go with Dave?

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:31.713
It went really well.

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:33.781
It's good, I think we
really worked it out now.

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:35.817
Really? 'Cause I got kind of
a strange message from him.

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:37.618
I have a surprise for you.

01:12:42.392 --> 01:12:43.624
We're goin' to Seattle.

01:12:43.626 --> 01:12:44.926
I know.

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:46.627
No.

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:47.729
No, no, wait.

01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:49.497
No, no, no, we're, we're,

01:12:49.499 --> 01:12:50.765
We're goin' tonight.

01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:05.046
I'm not going to wait to spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:06.581
It starts tonight.

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:17.058
Do you remember that
fight we had last week?

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.060
Yes.

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:20.395
Yes.

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:22.530
I never apologized to you.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.166
No, no, there's...

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:30.505
- You don't need to.
- It's just, I really love you in that shirt.

01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:32.408
I know you do.

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.010
It's okay.

01:13:37.414 --> 01:13:38.414
Go pack a bag.

01:13:39.883 --> 01:13:40.883
Okay.

01:13:57.167 --> 01:13:59.100
<i>Hey, it's Dave, uh.</i>

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.701
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

01:14:00.703 --> 01:14:02.603
Hi, Dave, it's me.
Just please call me back

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:04.539
as soon as you get this.

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:05.940
I think you might be right.

01:14:07.811 --> 01:14:09.110
I just, I want to make
sure you're okay.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.679
So just, please,
please, call me back.

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:13.448
Shit, shit, shit.

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:15.650
Shit.

01:14:15.652 --> 01:14:17.185
Babe, you okay?

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.956
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:25.993
Yeah, I'm fine. I just, I
stubbed my toe on the radiator.

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:28.596
- Want some ice or something?
- No, thank you.

01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:40.208
What the fuck.

01:14:42.212 --> 01:14:44.111
Lucy.

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:45.613
Lucy, oh, my God.

01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:46.647
Here, come on.

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:49.951
Lucy.

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:53.654
- I thought I'd never see you again.
- Shh.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:54.989
Okay, what is happening?

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.692
- I was in a parallel universe.
- What?

01:14:57.694 --> 01:15:00.795
And the other me, a parallel me,
he sent me here so he could take my place.

01:15:00.797 --> 01:15:03.731
- Oh, you can't be serious.
- If I'm not serious, then why are there two Todds?

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:05.066
Okay, okay, okay.

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:06.634
It was terrible.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:07.835
But Other Dave was there.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.271
And he helped me,
and now I'm back.

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:11.873
And we have to send
Other Todd back,

01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:14.542
or Dave, Other Dave,
he's in trouble.

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:15.977
- Do you know what I'm saying?
- No.

01:15:15.979 --> 01:15:17.545
Okay, in case anything happens,

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:18.913
I need you to know
that you were right.

01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:21.015
I'm sorry, I do have
a fucking bullshit

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:23.284
- resistant attitude.
- No, no, no. I shouldn't have pushed you.

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:24.886
Of course I want to
go with you, of course I do.

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:26.654
I just, I need to get
out of my own way.

01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:28.189
This is something we should
have decided together.

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:30.091
I needed to realize
how important it was to you.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:32.560
And honestly, what a small
sacrifice it is to go somewhere

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:34.695
- that's really still in this universe.
- Todd.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.631
It wasn't until I saw what the
world would be like without...

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:38.065
Okay, Todd, Todd.
I love you, too,

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:39.767
but I need you
to shut up right now.

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:41.869
Because I think something
happened to Dave.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.305
- Our Dave, what happened?
- All I know is that he went to see him,

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:46.007
and now Dave is not
answering his phone.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:47.775
I know exactly what happened.

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:49.644
We need to get Other Todd
back to the lab.

01:15:49.646 --> 01:15:51.946
I swear to God, you are not
making any sense right now.

01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:55.550
I'm going to call you in five
minutes. Pretend I'm Dave.

01:15:55.552 --> 01:15:57.151
Trust me.

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:58.786
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:17.071
Talkin' to someone?

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.673
I left a message for Dave.

01:16:18.675 --> 01:16:20.274
I just wanted to
let him know the good news.

01:16:20.276 --> 01:16:22.710
Oh. That's nice.

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:27.081
Oh, hey, Dave.

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:28.950
Yeah, he's here, why?

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:30.918
Oh, no.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.653
Hey, buddy, what's goin' on?

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:36.724
Dave, you all right?

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:40.695
Okay. Yeah.

01:16:40.697 --> 01:16:42.457
Yeah, no problem.
All right, just stay there.

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:46.033
He's wasted. I guess he had
too many drinks at the bar.

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.902
I'm going to go pick him up,
take him home.

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:49.737
- Let me come with you.
- No, no, no, no.

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:51.739
I got it, I'm good.

01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:53.641
You, uh...
Someone's got to pack, so.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:47.795
Oh, shit.

01:17:47.797 --> 01:17:49.697
Lucy.

01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:51.198
I can explain.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.433
I wish someone would.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:01.876
Listen, I know this looks bad.

01:18:01.878 --> 01:18:04.111
But I did this for you.

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:07.281
Okay, so you impersonated
my boyfriend

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:09.250
and kidnapped my brother for me?

01:18:09.252 --> 01:18:12.720
Okay, I may be guilty of
a little light kidnapping.

01:18:12.722 --> 01:18:14.722
But I am Todd.

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:17.458
I'm Todd Plus.
I'm better than Other Todd.

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:20.061
- You're Other Todd!
- You're Other Todd!

01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:23.615
All right, all right.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.066
Yes, you might be more
passionate than Todd,

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:26.333
and slightly thinner.

01:18:26.335 --> 01:18:29.904
But you, you're not Todd.

01:18:31.774 --> 01:18:33.040
Listen...

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:37.244
I did this to be,

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:39.046
I did this to be with you again.

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:42.249
What do you mean?

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:43.350
You didn't tell her?

01:18:45.254 --> 01:18:46.420
I was going to...

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:50.825
I was going to tell you.

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:55.329
Lucy, I did this because,
where I'm from,

01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:56.363
I lost you.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
You died.

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:02.036
And I had to be with you.

01:19:09.812 --> 01:19:10.911
Okay.

01:19:13.015 --> 01:19:14.348
That's, uh...

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:17.952
that's really sweet.

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:23.190
But you didn't do this for me.

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:26.060
No, I did it to be,

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:27.762
I did it to be with you.

01:19:27.764 --> 01:19:29.096
That's not the same thing.

01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:35.069
I am really sorry
about what happened.

01:19:35.071 --> 01:19:37.404
- Lucy.
- But I'm not her.

01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:39.774
No, you, you are her.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.510
No, I'm not.

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:48.415
You need to go back.

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:16.510
- Hey, bro.
- Holy shit.

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:18.312
A little help here?

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:20.181
Jesus Christ.

01:20:20.183 --> 01:20:22.049
Have you been there
the whole time?

01:20:36.933 --> 01:20:39.099
Mm, I should have
listened to you.

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.303
I was right.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:43.337
You were right.

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:49.944
I'm really glad
you and Todd are together.

01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:52.213
Yeah?

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:53.881
Yeah, Other Todd's an asshole.

01:20:56.552 --> 01:20:59.420
So they're ready
in there if you want to...

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:04.024
I don't know,
say goodbye or whatever.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:07.061
Do you think that's appropriate?

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:12.067
Okay.

01:21:47.904 --> 01:21:49.536
Hey, Lucy?

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:50.538
Yeah?

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.240
Did you sleep with him?

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.308
Todd.

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:55.342
Not a good time.

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:57.211
I get it, not a good time.

01:22:11.227 --> 01:22:13.027
Damn it!

01:22:22.138 --> 01:22:23.570
You're the...

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:31.578
Ow, damn it.

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:35.215
- What about ice cream? Is it all the same flavors?
- Yes.

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:36.984
- What about the sky?
- It's blue.

01:22:36.986 --> 01:22:39.286
Do dogs bark, do birds swim?
Do fish fly? What, like...

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:42.256
- Did you just ask if birds swim?
- What was this other me like?

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:44.658
Is he insane, too?
'Cause you were insane.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.026
No, no.

01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:47.561
He was a good guy.

01:22:48.597 --> 01:22:53.100
Yeah, he was like you
but smarter.

01:22:53.102 --> 01:22:55.436
Oh, you are such an asshole.

01:22:57.006 --> 01:22:58.539
- But he did have a mustache.
- Yeah?

01:22:58.541 --> 01:22:59.473
- That was different.
- Really?

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.175
Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:23:01.177 --> 01:23:02.543
What do you think?
You think I should grow one?

01:23:02.545 --> 01:23:03.677
No.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.346
I didn't say it looked good.

01:23:09.118 --> 01:23:11.719
Oh, shit, I missed
the fishing trip.

01:23:11.721 --> 01:23:14.521
No, I get it.
Circumstances and everything.

01:23:14.523 --> 01:23:16.423
- Yeah.
- What are you doin' tomorrow?

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:19.760
- Fishing?
- Yep.

01:23:23.466 --> 01:23:25.232
Oh, hey, Dave.

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:27.668
- Yeah?
- You know Abby, right?

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:30.037
Yeah, Lucy's cute
friend that hates me?

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:35.609
That's, that's pretty funny.

01:23:36.445 --> 01:23:37.445
Why is that funny?

01:23:38.414 --> 01:23:40.614
- See ya later, man.
- Todd.

01:23:40.616 --> 01:23:41.648
Why is that funny?

01:23:48.457 --> 01:23:50.190
I have no idea what's going on.

01:23:56.599 --> 01:24:01.602
Yes, I do see here that
it says nonrefundable tickets.

01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:04.805
But it's a funny story,
'cause I actually,

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:06.673
I didn't book the tickets.

01:24:08.077 --> 01:24:09.443
Yes, that's me.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.413
No, I didn't change my mind.

01:24:12.415 --> 01:24:14.748
I didn't,
like I said, I know it's...

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:15.750
It's a long story.

01:24:16.752 --> 01:24:18.285
Okay.

01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:19.620
All right, thank you.

01:24:21.123 --> 01:24:22.456
Bye.

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:24.091
So they don't take
the whole twin

01:24:24.093 --> 01:24:28.195
- from another universe excuse?
- No.

01:24:28.197 --> 01:24:33.100
No, they didn't, but now we
have a 2,500 dollar credit, so.

01:24:35.204 --> 01:24:36.204
So.

01:24:36.806 --> 01:24:38.238
So.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.474
I got offered a job in Seattle.

01:24:43.112 --> 01:24:45.412
- I know.
- No, Todd, we're starting over.

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.848
Oh, okay. Sorry.

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:52.419
I was offered a job in Seattle.
What do you think?

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:54.855
I think that's a swell
opportunity, Luce.

01:24:55.858 --> 01:24:58.759
- You think we should go?
- I'm glad you asked.

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:01.829
I think we should make
a quick pro, con list.

01:25:01.831 --> 01:25:04.098
- Terrific idea.
- Great.

01:25:08.504 --> 01:25:09.703
Scooch.

01:25:09.705 --> 01:25:11.405
Okay.

01:25:11.407 --> 01:25:13.640
Pro, Providence.

01:25:15.111 --> 01:25:17.478
We'd get to see
your brother more.

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.280
Con, Providence, we'd have
to see my brother more.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.116
Okay, great, those cancel out.

01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:24.218
Okay.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.653
Pro, Providence.

01:25:26.655 --> 01:25:29.790
Oh, did I mention that
Dave and Abby are married

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:32.126
- in the parallel universe?
- No.

01:25:32.128 --> 01:25:33.460
Yes, yeah, that's entirely true.

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:35.395
That's a distant universe.

01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:49.643
Oh.

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:52.613
Read it.

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:56.383
What? You want me to
read you the book?

01:25:56.385 --> 01:25:58.218
Read it.

01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:59.220
Okay.

01:26:01.423 --> 01:26:04.558
So once upon a time,
there was a little boy

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.493
who went to a parallel universe.

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:10.631
And then he tried
to get the girl.

01:26:10.633 --> 01:26:13.700
And then things don't work out
as he had planned.

01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:19.673
But it all kind of
works out in the end, so...
