doing my makeup in the car
'cause I overslept.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.599
Not that I wear
a lot of makeup.

03:38.257 --> 03:40.869
(Kensi laughs)

03:49.862 --> 03:51.507
Go.

03:51.509 --> 03:54.468
Uh, the FBI just released this

03:54.470 --> 03:56.706
to all the major news outlets.

03:56.708 --> 04:00.556
Earlier this morning, the
FBI apprehended Gavin Knowles,

04:00.558 --> 04:03.649
a man, we suspect, planned to
detonate an explosive device

04:03.651 --> 04:05.624
in the city of Los Angeles.

04:05.626 --> 04:08.174
With his arrest, I'm proud
to announce the FBI

04:08.176 --> 04:11.415
thwarted an act of terrorism
against our great nation.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.629
The FBI moved in after a bomb
detonated in Knowles truck.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.661
And he lived
to tell the tale?

04:17.663 --> 04:19.510
NELL: Apparently,
the device started smoking

04:19.512 --> 04:20.833
after this car rear-ended him.

04:20.834 --> 04:23.476
And Knowles abandoned the
vehicle before the explosion.

04:26.006 --> 04:28.482
Well, if it was smoking,
it was probably a chemical bomb.

04:28.484 --> 04:30.084
And if a fender-bender
triggered it,

04:30.086 --> 04:31.869
means it was highly unstable.

04:31.871 --> 04:34.182
Okay, two questions:
Who is Gavin Knowles,

04:34.184 --> 04:36.578
and how does he know how to make
third rate chemical bombs?

04:36.580 --> 04:38.776
ERIC: That, I don't know.
But what I do know,

04:38.778 --> 04:41.006
is that he was a former Marine.

04:41.008 --> 04:44.575
A medical discharge under
honorable conditions

04:44.577 --> 04:46.937
after an IED took out most of
his squad in Afghanistan.

04:46.939 --> 04:48.479
And no formal training
with explosives?

04:48.504 --> 04:49.549
Could have taught himself.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.416
Give folks a taste
of what life is like

04:51.418 --> 04:52.390
across the Afghan border.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.100
What kind of trouble
has Knowles been in

04:54.102 --> 04:55.150
since he's been state side?

04:55.152 --> 04:56.759
Few scrapes with the LAPD, but

04:56.761 --> 04:58.824
nothing that would have
predicted this.

04:58.827 --> 05:02.314
If you can predict this.

05:02.316 --> 05:04.008
Initial thoughts?

05:04.010 --> 05:06.125
How do we not know about
a terrorist plot,

05:06.127 --> 05:07.429
right here in L.A.?

05:07.431 --> 05:09.342
Something about this just
doesn't feel right.

05:09.344 --> 05:12.543
Because you smell
foul play, Mr. Callen,

05:12.545 --> 05:15.373
or because you didn't
find Gavin Knowles first?

05:15.375 --> 05:16.772
DEEKS:
Ooh...

05:16.774 --> 05:19.079
and that's why they call her
Henrietta the Hammer.

05:19.081 --> 05:21.236
Straight up, Mr. Deeks.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.638
I just got off the phone with
Assistant Director Granger.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.967
The man's apoplectic that the
FBI got this collar, and not us.

05:28.969 --> 05:32.051
After all, Gavin Knowles
is a former Marine.

05:32.053 --> 05:33.819
Granger's apoplectic?

05:33.821 --> 05:37.947
Oh, I heard a vein pop,
Mr. Hanna.

05:37.949 --> 05:41.517
No joke, I've witnessed this two
or three times in the field.

05:41.519 --> 05:43.590
I know what to listen for.

05:43.592 --> 05:44.601
KENSI: So, what does
Granger want us to do?

05:44.603 --> 05:46.419
FBI already made the arrest.

05:46.421 --> 05:49.166
HETTY: Granger wants you
to find what you missed.

05:49.168 --> 05:51.895
And what the FBI didn't.

05:51.897 --> 05:52.804
Well, that seems
like a great use of

05:52.806 --> 05:54.169
our national security
resources.

05:54.171 --> 05:55.382
CALLEN:
No, guys, Granger's right.

05:55.384 --> 05:57.656
We should have been
all over this.

06:12.869 --> 06:14.249
Smell that?

06:14.251 --> 06:16.219
Chlorine.

06:16.221 --> 06:17.585
Chemical bomb,
just like I thought.

06:17.587 --> 06:19.606
Hey, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:19.608 --> 06:20.936
Hold it right there.

06:20.938 --> 06:25.614
Special Agent
Jonas Ambrose, FBI.

06:25.616 --> 06:26.895
Agent Callen, NCIS.

06:26.897 --> 06:29.160
I need to see your I.D.

06:29.162 --> 06:31.244
That goes for all of you.

06:31.246 --> 06:32.886
Agent Hinty,
get their I.D. number.

06:32.888 --> 06:34.330
Okay.

06:37.532 --> 06:38.696
Don't, uh...

06:38.698 --> 06:40.928
take anything.

06:40.930 --> 06:43.276
We also need to
speak to Knowles.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.572
He's in FBI custody.

06:44.574 --> 06:46.049
You're not going to
let us question

06:46.051 --> 06:48.019
the prime suspect
in a terrorist plot?

06:48.021 --> 06:50.120
Well, I don't have
a problem, so long as you

06:50.122 --> 06:51.515
fill out and file
the correct paperwork.

06:51.517 --> 06:53.124
Takes about three weeks
to process it

06:53.126 --> 06:56.570
before you get an answer,
which will still be no.

06:56.572 --> 06:59.033
You know our agencies typically
work together, right?

06:59.035 --> 07:02.676
Well, I don't make the rules,
I just live by them.

07:03.662 --> 07:05.138
Hinty.

07:07.026 --> 07:09.898
(cell phone ringing)

07:09.900 --> 07:13.197
When do we get to
sit down with Knowles?

07:13.199 --> 07:15.516
According to the FBI handbook
over there, we don't.

07:16.851 --> 07:18.853
Well, nobody was hurt,
Knowles is behind bars,

07:18.855 --> 07:21.305
so that's good.
Or very bad...

07:21.307 --> 07:23.157
if there's more
unstable bombs out there.

07:23.159 --> 07:26.327
Why do I always have to be the
hopeless optimist on this team?

07:26.329 --> 07:28.864
Probably because you're the only
one that watches musicals.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.865
Losing out on our own
territory to that guy,

07:30.867 --> 07:33.035
no wonder
Granger's is pissed.

07:33.037 --> 07:35.154
The evidence so far says
Knowles is the guy.

07:35.156 --> 07:38.123
Well, that's what
the evidence says.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.374
(chuckles)

07:39.376 --> 07:40.848
Nate!
SAM: Nate.

07:42.019 --> 07:44.396
The FBI has
got this one wrong.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.790
So, after we
saw you in Yemen...

07:57.792 --> 08:00.587
Okay, after Yemen
was Venezuela,

08:00.589 --> 08:02.712
then Russia and Turkey.

08:02.714 --> 08:05.307
Oh, South Africa then Turkey.

08:05.309 --> 08:07.901
And half a dozen
stops in between.

08:07.903 --> 08:09.375
That you're not
at liberty to discuss.

08:09.377 --> 08:11.936
Profilers are in
demand these days.

08:11.938 --> 08:13.226
SAM: You must be
flying first class,

08:13.228 --> 08:14.783

08:14.785 --> 08:16.356
CALLEN: Warm chocolate chip
cookies taste

08:16.358 --> 08:18.382
so much better at 30,000 feet.

08:18.384 --> 08:19.805
Pssh! I wouldn't know.

08:19.807 --> 08:21.545
Ow! Really?

08:21.547 --> 08:23.387
I'm training Deeks
to not make himself

08:23.389 --> 08:24.860
the center of every
conversation.

08:24.862 --> 08:27.589
- With pain?
- With proven scientific methods.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.263
So, what brings you in
from Turkey?

08:29.265 --> 08:31.355
Joint FBI task force to help

08:31.357 --> 08:32.861
identify domestic terrorists.

08:32.864 --> 08:35.857
So, is Ambrose a part
of this task force?

08:35.860 --> 08:38.001
Yes, he's the one who helped
zero in on Gavin Knowles.

08:38.003 --> 08:39.336
And?

08:39.337 --> 08:40.620
Ambrose is a decent agent,

08:40.621 --> 08:43.121
but this arrest plus
the FBI announcement

08:43.124 --> 08:44.892
that they prevented
some terrorist plot

08:44.894 --> 08:46.876
are premature at best.

08:46.878 --> 08:48.846
And I take it Ambrose wasn't
interested in your opinion?

08:48.848 --> 08:50.630
I thought you guys might be.

08:50.632 --> 08:52.182
Right, as always, Nate.

08:52.184 --> 08:54.602
But, your insight isn't
going to do us much good

08:54.604 --> 08:56.636
unless we can find a way
to question Gavin.

08:56.638 --> 08:58.806
And I take it, breaking into
the FBI is off the table?

08:58.808 --> 09:00.024
SAM:
For now.

09:00.026 --> 09:01.941
Gavin's apartment's
different story.

09:01.943 --> 09:03.660
All right,
Deeks and I will take

09:03.662 --> 09:05.612
the diner where he
got arrested.

09:05.614 --> 09:06.813
Hey.

09:06.815 --> 09:08.949
Big Nate.
Yeah.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.290
Nate?!

09:17.292 --> 09:20.460
Nell! Hi!

09:22.847 --> 09:25.633
Eric!
Nate... What's up man? (chuckles)

09:25.635 --> 09:27.600
I can't believe you're here.

09:27.602 --> 09:29.937
Wow, I want to hear all about
your travel adventures.

09:29.939 --> 09:33.089
And, um, I meant to send you
that care package but,

09:33.091 --> 09:37.228
I'm sorry-- I hope
my e-mails have been enough.

09:46.655 --> 09:48.155
Not this guy again.

09:48.157 --> 09:49.773
Ambrose's lackey.

09:49.775 --> 09:51.876
We play the Hetty card?

09:51.878 --> 09:53.294
It won't work.

09:53.296 --> 09:55.296
He's so green, he won't
know who she is yet.

09:55.298 --> 09:57.448
Then we use that.

09:57.450 --> 10:00.551
Ego, thy name is Agent Fresh
Out Of The Academy.

10:00.553 --> 10:01.719
(chuckles)

10:01.721 --> 10:02.837
Don't tell me Ambrose

10:02.839 --> 10:04.922
has you standing watch
out here.

10:04.924 --> 10:07.558
There could be valuable evidence
inside Knowles' apartment.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.542
Guarding a scene's
an invaluable skill.

10:09.544 --> 10:11.979
Took me two whole days to teach
my Doberman the same thing.

10:11.981 --> 10:13.681
How long you been
out of the academy?

10:13.683 --> 10:15.316
Almost six weeks.

10:15.318 --> 10:19.185
Ambrose obviously doesn't
recognize talent. Unless...

10:19.187 --> 10:22.389
what did you say when he told
you not to let us inside?

10:22.391 --> 10:23.907
How did you know
he said that?

10:23.909 --> 10:25.893
You heard the man;
answer him.

10:25.895 --> 10:27.996
I... I didn't ask why.

10:27.998 --> 10:29.344
There you have it.
Ambrose is right.

10:29.346 --> 10:30.545
We're dealing with
an empty suit here.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.074
A real live yes man.

10:32.076 --> 10:34.211
Uh... uh...
Only thing left on my list is Bigfoot.

10:34.213 --> 10:35.691
I-I'm not a yes man, okay?

10:35.693 --> 10:37.729
It's okay, all right?
SAM: He'll go a long way.

10:37.731 --> 10:39.094
As long as
Ambrose is his boss.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.738
And some people are
better at following orders

10:40.740 --> 10:42.152
than giving them, so...
Good point.

10:42.154 --> 10:44.601
Hey! I'm in charge here.

10:46.114 --> 10:48.243
You got five minutes.

10:48.245 --> 10:51.322
Okay.

10:52.455 --> 10:53.652
Be right out.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.748
Let's be quick before
he changes his mind.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.478
AMBROSE: Don't even
think about it.

10:59.178 --> 11:00.958
(sighs)

11:07.316 --> 11:10.295
You two just crossed the line.

11:10.297 --> 11:12.174
We were invited
to cross.

11:12.176 --> 11:14.737
It's called
cooperation, Ambrose.

11:14.739 --> 11:16.419
Then cooperate
by filing the proper paperwork.

11:16.421 --> 11:18.582
You want the
form number?

11:18.584 --> 11:21.112
No, we're good.

11:22.860 --> 11:25.577
That's nice.

11:28.449 --> 11:29.832
Menus are at the counter.

11:29.834 --> 11:32.361
The soup of the day is,
uh, corn chowder.

11:32.363 --> 11:35.163
You can sit wherever
you'd like, okay?

11:35.165 --> 11:37.181
Sorry, it's been
a little nuts here today.

11:37.183 --> 11:38.411
No, it's fine.
We're actually here

11:38.413 --> 11:40.257
about the man the FBI
arrested this morning.

11:40.259 --> 11:42.684
Oh. You guys are
a little bit late.

11:42.686 --> 11:44.957
Wackos already cleared
the place out.

11:44.959 --> 11:48.033
The only memorabilia I got left
is the pepper shaker he used,

11:48.035 --> 11:50.887
but I can give that
to you for a great price.

11:50.889 --> 11:52.049
Sorry. How's that?

11:52.051 --> 11:53.279
No judgment.
Just, go ahead.

11:53.281 --> 11:55.207
Check and see
what it's going for online.

11:55.209 --> 11:56.738
Yeah. That's not
going to happen.

11:56.740 --> 11:57.867
We're federal agents.

11:57.869 --> 11:59.946
Is that a real...?
DEEKS: Was Gavin Knowles

11:59.948 --> 12:01.259
a regular here?
Yeah.

12:01.261 --> 12:03.720
Yeah, uh, he'd come by
all the time.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.632
Always wanted to sit
in Mia's section.

12:05.634 --> 12:06.962
Mia?

12:06.964 --> 12:09.156
Um...

12:09.158 --> 12:12.864
Goth chick,
doesn't share tips.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.908
Okay. Thanks.

12:14.910 --> 12:17.602
KENSI:
Mia?

12:17.604 --> 12:19.380
We'd like to ask you
some questions

12:19.382 --> 12:21.425
about Gavin Knowles.

12:21.427 --> 12:23.061
You guys FBI?

12:23.063 --> 12:25.888
NCIS-- FBI's hipper
younger brother.

12:25.889 --> 12:28.450
Gavin's innocent, you know.

12:28.452 --> 12:30.599
Did he say anything

12:30.601 --> 12:33.624
about what happened to
his truck this morning?

12:33.626 --> 12:35.607
He was freaked out.

12:35.609 --> 12:37.509
That bomb really
brought it back.

12:37.511 --> 12:39.525
The IED that took out his squad
in Afghanistan?

12:39.527 --> 12:42.005
Gavin came back a little broken,
but he's getting help.

12:42.007 --> 12:43.657
And even at his worst,

12:43.659 --> 12:45.227
he would never terrorize
innocent people

12:45.229 --> 12:47.326
with what he went through
over there.

12:47.328 --> 12:49.360
Well, how long
have you known for?

12:49.362 --> 12:51.309
We've been dating
about six months.

12:51.311 --> 12:53.657
I'd say you kind of buried
the lead there.

12:53.659 --> 12:55.765
I didn't want our relationship
to cloud the issue.

12:55.767 --> 12:56.778
Ah.

12:56.780 --> 12:57.874
Gavin's innocent.

12:57.876 --> 12:59.678
There's no way
that was his bomb.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.994
But you're still at work?

13:00.996 --> 13:02.901
Who could afford not to be?

13:02.903 --> 13:05.379
KENSI:
Has he been upset,

13:05.381 --> 13:08.247
or acting strangely lately?

13:08.249 --> 13:09.984
No.

13:09.986 --> 13:12.380
Nothing out of the ordinary
for a combat veteran

13:12.382 --> 13:15.246
who saw all of his friends die
in an IED explosion.

13:15.248 --> 13:17.996
- Okay.
- Thank you.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.318
Can I give you my number in case
you think of anything else?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.569
Yeah.

13:22.571 --> 13:25.186
If you hear anything about
Gavin, will you let me know?

13:25.188 --> 13:27.005
- Sure. Give me your number.
- Okay.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.662
You know, he was using
Mia's phone.

13:30.664 --> 13:32.124
What?

13:32.126 --> 13:34.042
The bomber dude.

13:34.044 --> 13:36.235
Came in here looking
kind of rattled;

13:36.237 --> 13:38.380
used Mia's phone
to make some calls.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.469
MIA:
If I think of anything,

13:39.471 --> 13:40.606
I'll call you.

13:40.608 --> 13:42.410
Thank you.
No problem.

13:42.412 --> 13:45.043
Hey, Eric, I need you
to look up a cell phone number

13:45.045 --> 13:46.748
and trace every call made
between the time

13:46.750 --> 13:48.780
the bomb went off
and when Gavin was arrested.

13:48.782 --> 13:50.450
The name is.. Mia Jameson.

13:50.452 --> 13:52.482
The number is 555-0127.

13:52.484 --> 13:54.031
ERIC:
Okay, got it.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.476
There were just two calls,
both to an auto garage.

13:56.478 --> 13:57.682
What do we got?

13:57.684 --> 13:58.991
I'm putting you on speaker.

13:58.993 --> 14:00.660
DEEKS: Gavin used his girlfriend's
cell phone

14:00.662 --> 14:03.330
to call a garage
this morning... twice.

14:03.332 --> 14:05.705
Gavin's profile suggests
he's not the loner type.

14:05.707 --> 14:07.428
Well, maybe he
wasn't working alone.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.667
Deeks, you and Kensi
go check it out.

14:09.669 --> 14:10.924
We'll update Hetty.

14:10.926 --> 14:12.576
Okay. We're on it.
Let's go.

14:12.578 --> 14:16.726
You know, I'm feeling a little,
uh, antsy this morning,

14:16.728 --> 14:18.827
so I'm gonna go work it
on out at the gym.

14:18.829 --> 14:20.377
Mm-hmm.

14:20.379 --> 14:21.797
In those?

14:21.799 --> 14:24.254
Uh, yeah, I always
work out in these.

14:24.256 --> 14:25.441
They build...

14:25.443 --> 14:27.479
arch support.

14:27.481 --> 14:28.432
Oh.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.470
(quiet laugh)
Okay.

14:30.472 --> 14:32.609
So...

14:32.611 --> 14:35.668
(clears throat)

14:35.670 --> 14:37.890
So, you're back.

14:37.892 --> 14:39.812
Yeah, I'm back.
Hmm.

14:39.814 --> 14:41.383
For a little while.

14:41.385 --> 14:43.573
That's cool, man.

14:47.668 --> 14:49.873
Why are you looking
at me like that?

14:49.875 --> 14:53.122
I'm pretty sure you were
flirting with me this morning.

14:53.124 --> 14:54.995
- What?!
- Yeah.

14:54.997 --> 14:56.357
(laughs)

14:56.359 --> 14:59.066
No. That's my signature
welcome-back-buddy-hug thing.

14:59.067 --> 15:01.495
That's... standard issue.

15:02.464 --> 15:05.336
Now why are you
looking at me like <i>that?</i>

15:05.338 --> 15:08.455
'Cause you're definitely <i>not</i>
flirting with me now.

15:08.457 --> 15:10.474
Now that, uh...

15:10.476 --> 15:12.691
we're alone.

15:12.693 --> 15:14.825
(laughs)

15:15.942 --> 15:18.601
You think the hug thing

15:18.603 --> 15:20.571
had something to do with...

15:20.573 --> 15:21.885
Eric?

15:21.887 --> 15:23.982
Oh, that's... that's good.

15:23.984 --> 15:25.546
(laughs)

15:25.548 --> 15:27.443
Oh, yeah. No, that's
hilarious, actually.

15:27.445 --> 15:28.858
Nell, I get paid

15:28.860 --> 15:31.270
to read people
for a living, but, uh...

15:31.272 --> 15:33.633
a 12-year-old could figure out
what you're doing.

15:33.635 --> 15:35.463
Okay.

15:35.465 --> 15:36.678
You know what?

15:36.680 --> 15:39.008
You've been gone a little
too long, my friend.

15:39.010 --> 15:40.838
I'll say that.
I mean, Eric?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.701
Really, we're
talking about Eric.

15:42.703 --> 15:44.981
Okay, Eric?

15:44.983 --> 15:47.742
Going to stop
saying Eric now.

15:47.744 --> 15:51.071
You can run, but I'm already
in your head, Little Nell.

15:52.486 --> 15:54.499
Still got it.

15:54.501 --> 15:56.329
DEEKS:
I keep forgetting the name

15:56.331 --> 15:58.926
of the club that you
and Nell were at last night.

15:58.928 --> 16:00.645
It was the, um...

16:00.647 --> 16:02.635
Oh, you almost got
me with that one.

16:02.638 --> 16:03.900
Just saying,
we're partners, you know?

16:03.902 --> 16:06.886
I should know what my partner
is up to at all time for...

16:06.888 --> 16:08.589
for safety's sake.

16:08.591 --> 16:10.530
For safety?
That's right.

16:10.532 --> 16:12.621
Okay, where were
you last night?

16:12.623 --> 16:13.936
Shh. Do you hear that?

16:13.938 --> 16:15.825
(scoffing):
Yeah.

16:15.827 --> 16:17.394
It's the sound of you
changing the subject.

16:17.396 --> 16:18.489
No, no, no, it's a bike.

16:18.491 --> 16:20.295
(motorcycle revving)

16:20.297 --> 16:23.044
Make that plural.

16:23.046 --> 16:24.478
Bikes-zzz.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.513
And here we go.

16:27.515 --> 16:30.297
(engines revving)

16:35.830 --> 16:37.526
Kensi and I are at the garage.

16:37.528 --> 16:39.055
They got something
going down.

16:39.057 --> 16:41.552
HETTY:
My thoughts exactly, Mr. Deeks.

16:41.554 --> 16:43.648
We've had an anonymous tip.

16:43.650 --> 16:45.678
A terrorist group claimed

16:45.680 --> 16:48.422
it was responsible
for this morning's car bomb,

16:48.424 --> 16:49.887
and not Gavin Knowles.

16:49.889 --> 16:54.063
And they warned that there are
more bombs on the way.

16:54.065 --> 16:56.958
We're tracking the source
of the tip right now.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.288
Can we keep it quiet?

16:58.290 --> 16:59.652
Unfortunately,

16:59.654 --> 17:01.378
no.

17:01.380 --> 17:04.727
It seems the news outlets
got wind of it.

17:04.729 --> 17:05.945
Mr. Beale?

17:05.948 --> 17:07.569
A radical terrorist group
has threatened

17:07.571 --> 17:10.531
to attack the city
of Los Angeles by day's end...

17:10.532 --> 17:12.087
Does that mean
Gavin's innocent?

17:12.089 --> 17:15.943
I don't know, but get ready for
a lot of really nervous people.

17:15.944 --> 17:17.280
Which is exactly
the point.

17:17.281 --> 17:19.073
First the FBI,

17:19.075 --> 17:21.018
now the media.

17:21.020 --> 17:23.252
Playing right into
the terrorists' hands.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.358
(sighs)

17:38.360 --> 17:40.929
You guys just don't quit.

17:40.931 --> 17:43.688
Nate, I expected
more from you.

17:43.690 --> 17:46.196
I personally recruited you
to the joint task force,

17:46.198 --> 17:49.905
but it appears you've gone over
to the dark side.

17:49.907 --> 17:52.046
There really aren't
supposed to be sides.

17:52.048 --> 17:55.170
Our directors asked
us to work together.

17:55.172 --> 17:56.842
Well, unfortunately,
the FBI has already

17:56.844 --> 17:58.681
closed the book on this one.

17:58.683 --> 18:00.452
Even though there could
still be more bombs out there?

18:00.454 --> 18:02.191
Look, if the case is closed,
what is the fear

18:02.193 --> 18:04.631
in letting us speak
to Knowles?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.873
Fine.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.180
But Nate is the one
to interview Knowles

18:10.182 --> 18:12.404
as part of the joint task force.

18:12.406 --> 18:15.529
Now, was that so hard?

18:29.571 --> 18:32.662
That mirror works
two ways, you know.

18:32.664 --> 18:36.266
So any information you get
from him helps me, too.

18:36.268 --> 18:37.645
Understand what I'm saying?

18:37.647 --> 18:39.638
All right, Nate.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.868
Signal's strong.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.679
I'll make sure to let them know.

18:49.108 --> 18:50.735
NATE:
Hello, Gavin.

18:50.737 --> 18:52.098
I'm Nate Getz.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.725
I'm a psychologist.

18:56.085 --> 18:57.629
Was wondering
when they'd make me talk

18:57.631 --> 18:58.824
to one of you.

18:58.826 --> 19:00.868
Talked to psychologists before?

19:02.713 --> 19:04.506
Afghanistan, maybe?

19:04.508 --> 19:07.264
After the explosion?

19:07.266 --> 19:10.360
Is that why
you were medically discharged?

19:11.438 --> 19:13.756
Remind him it was an
honorable discharge.

19:13.758 --> 19:15.578
No shame there.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.616
You were honorably discharged.
If it makes...

19:17.618 --> 19:19.437
I had nothing to do
with that bomb.

19:19.439 --> 19:21.491
Then how did it get
in the back of your truck?

19:21.493 --> 19:22.866
I don't know.

19:22.868 --> 19:24.771
Someone must have planted it.

19:24.773 --> 19:26.211
Who would do that to you?

19:26.213 --> 19:28.134
- How am I supposed to know?!
- You don't know

19:28.136 --> 19:30.617
who'd put a bomb
in the back of your truck?

19:30.619 --> 19:32.804
I told you, I don't know.

19:34.792 --> 19:37.999
Gavin, I'm here
to help you...

19:39.053 --> 19:41.474
...but you have
to want me to help you.

19:41.476 --> 19:44.180
And that starts
by you telling the truth.

19:44.182 --> 19:46.202
Don't start
with the psychobabble.

19:46.204 --> 19:48.040
They had a mark on my head,

19:48.042 --> 19:50.713
and now they've got me
right where they want me.

19:50.715 --> 19:52.099
Okay.

19:52.101 --> 19:54.004
Who might that be?

19:54.006 --> 19:56.008
Isn't it obvious?

19:56.010 --> 19:58.098
The FBI.

19:59.518 --> 20:01.772
NATE: What does the FBI have
to do with this?

20:01.774 --> 20:03.105
Where can I start?

20:03.107 --> 20:04.719
(door opening)

20:04.721 --> 20:06.451
Okay, we're done here.

20:06.476 --> 20:07.861
Well, no-- I just started
interviewing him.

20:07.864 --> 20:09.742
The suspect is
clearly paranoid.

20:09.744 --> 20:11.224
This won't be

20:11.226 --> 20:13.156
a productive conversation
for anyone. Come on.

20:13.158 --> 20:14.488
- You can't just...
- You can try again later.

20:14.490 --> 20:15.653
Gavin... Gavin...

20:15.655 --> 20:16.819
Wait!

20:23.680 --> 20:25.427
What do you think?

20:25.429 --> 20:27.058
His anger's a
coping mechanism.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.724
So Gavin is
some shell-shocked vet

20:28.726 --> 20:30.255
who's turned
against his own country?

20:30.257 --> 20:31.720
It's not totally
out of the question,

20:31.722 --> 20:33.750
but I think there's
something else going on here.

20:33.752 --> 20:34.864
He left

20:34.866 --> 20:37.125
the Marines to escape
the nightmare of IEDs.

20:37.127 --> 20:40.286
Doesn't make sense for him to
start building them on his own.

20:40.288 --> 20:42.565
Well, unless it's his way
of confronting his fears,

20:42.567 --> 20:45.425
like some sort of
a... aversion therapy.

20:45.427 --> 20:47.388
Only one thing's for sure.

20:47.390 --> 20:48.969
Ambrose got spooked.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.796
Ambrose.

20:51.798 --> 20:53.543
KENSI:
<i>What have we got, guys?</i>

20:53.545 --> 20:55.305
Nell and I finished
analyzing the photos

20:55.307 --> 20:56.723
you took at the auto garage.

20:56.725 --> 20:59.311
Most of these guys have
been in and out of prison,

20:59.313 --> 21:01.173
but have gone
radio silent lately.

21:01.175 --> 21:03.399
Maybe they've gone into
planning mode for something big.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.964
Domestic terrorism?

21:04.966 --> 21:06.975
LAPD deals with these guys
all the time--

21:06.977 --> 21:08.326
assault, demolition, B & E.

21:08.328 --> 21:10.189
I wouldn't put it
past them.

21:10.191 --> 21:13.040
In that case, what's
your stance on chaps?

21:13.042 --> 21:15.743
Never on a first date.

21:15.745 --> 21:19.139
Well, almost never.

21:20.392 --> 21:22.549
(engines revving)

21:32.028 --> 21:35.373
You know how wolves can smell
the tiniest drop of fear?

21:35.375 --> 21:37.242
Yeah.

21:37.244 --> 21:40.411
And when they do,
they attack without mercy?

21:40.413 --> 21:42.380
Wolves' den?

21:42.382 --> 21:44.016
Wolves' den.

21:44.018 --> 21:45.283
Relax. We're gonna be fine.

21:45.285 --> 21:48.019
Just saying.

21:48.021 --> 21:50.555
We could be walking into
the middle of a terrorist cell.

21:50.557 --> 21:52.257
Kensi, we are highly-trained
operatives, all right?

21:52.259 --> 21:54.560
Equipped with the skill
and experience to blend in

21:54.562 --> 21:56.544
to even the most
dangerous of situations.

21:56.546 --> 21:59.431
They're not gonna
give us a second look.

21:59.433 --> 22:02.267
(hard rock music blaring)

22:09.326 --> 22:10.609
Fellas...

22:10.611 --> 22:11.893
Cop! He's a cop!

22:13.245 --> 22:15.130
Was it the chaps?
Get him!

22:15.865 --> 22:17.449
Federal agents!
Don't move!

22:22.655 --> 22:23.672
(panting)

22:23.674 --> 22:24.790
Who's a wolf now?

22:24.792 --> 22:26.959
(motorcycle revving outside)
I got this. Go!

22:29.512 --> 22:31.079
Sorry about the table.

22:36.385 --> 22:37.385
(groans)

22:37.387 --> 22:39.305
(sighs)
Harold.

22:39.307 --> 22:41.439
My main man Harold.

22:41.441 --> 22:42.707
Maude, no!

22:42.709 --> 22:44.593
Maude?

22:44.595 --> 22:47.729
Harold, you named
your bike Maude?

22:47.731 --> 22:49.647
Get up.

22:49.649 --> 22:51.816
I always knew you had
a sensitive side.

22:51.818 --> 22:53.267
Let's go.

22:53.269 --> 22:55.036
So how is it that you
two know each other?

22:55.038 --> 22:56.204
What, Harold here?

22:56.206 --> 22:58.122
I arrested him a few years back
for B-and-E.

22:58.124 --> 22:59.157
Ain't that right, Harold?

22:59.159 --> 23:00.608
I'm a free man, Deeks.

23:00.610 --> 23:01.826
You can't keep me here.

23:01.828 --> 23:03.460
Yeah, you're a free man
on parole.

23:03.462 --> 23:06.113
And I know that you know that
hanging out with known felons

23:06.115 --> 23:07.548
is a big parole no-no.

23:07.550 --> 23:09.132
Come on, man.

23:09.134 --> 23:10.802
They're my friends.

23:10.804 --> 23:12.320
Friends don't let
friends go back to jail.

23:12.322 --> 23:15.006
What do you know
about Gavin Knowles?

23:15.008 --> 23:16.047
Who?

23:16.049 --> 23:17.270
DEEKS:
You really prepared

23:17.272 --> 23:19.188
to abandon Maude
in her time of need?

23:19.801 --> 23:20.874
Yeah, that's right.

23:20.876 --> 23:23.055
Spartacus over here
named his bike Maude.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.867
All right, what were you
guys up to in the bar?

23:27.869 --> 23:28.891
Nothing.

23:28.893 --> 23:30.379
We were playing pool.

23:30.381 --> 23:32.528
You know, my kid sister's
actually, uh,

23:32.530 --> 23:34.264
in the market for a motorcycle.

23:34.266 --> 23:36.794
But she's a first-time rider, so
I'm sure she's gonna lay it down

23:36.796 --> 23:38.644
a half dozen times or so...
Man...

23:39.423 --> 23:41.257
Harold...

23:43.109 --> 23:45.456
Word is...

23:45.458 --> 23:47.373
there's a terrorist group.

23:47.375 --> 23:49.605
Right here in L.A.

23:49.607 --> 23:52.029
Really? That's the generic crap
you're feeding us?

23:52.031 --> 23:53.394
And it's the truth!

23:53.396 --> 23:54.724
Did I mention
my sister's farsighted?

23:54.726 --> 23:56.004
Okay! Okay!

23:58.026 --> 23:59.626
(sighs)

23:59.628 --> 24:03.161
Someone's been asking for...

24:03.163 --> 24:04.340
demolition advice.

24:04.342 --> 24:06.041
You mean a
chemical bomb.

24:06.043 --> 24:09.037
Chemical bomb?

24:09.039 --> 24:10.521
Nuh-uh.

24:10.523 --> 24:12.121
Someone's been asking around

24:12.123 --> 24:14.023
about how to make
a compact bomb.

24:14.025 --> 24:16.128
Size of a pack of cigarettes.

24:16.130 --> 24:17.425
DEEKS:
Who's asking?

24:17.427 --> 24:20.794
I don't know.
I swear.

24:20.796 --> 24:23.875
KENSI: Who was asking
about a compact bomb?

24:23.877 --> 24:26.039
Think he's telling
the truth.

24:26.041 --> 24:27.809
I agree.

24:27.811 --> 24:30.465
Gavin had a chemical bomb
in his truck.

24:30.467 --> 24:32.678
What's he going to do
with a compact bomb?

24:32.680 --> 24:35.333
Pick a target,
hide it, trigger it.

24:35.335 --> 24:38.283
Bomb like that is used to
take out someone specific.

24:38.285 --> 24:39.430
ERIC:
Guys.

24:39.432 --> 24:41.366
Something you should see.

24:41.368 --> 24:42.972
This is coming to you live.

24:42.974 --> 24:45.185
The FBI believes
this anonymous tip

24:45.187 --> 24:46.938
to be nothing more than a hoax.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.364
We've confirmed that
Gavin Knowles acted alone

24:49.366 --> 24:51.888
and are not pursuing
any additional suspects.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.249
That's a dangerous
bluff to call,

24:53.251 --> 24:54.902
especially if there's a
terrorist group still out there.

24:54.904 --> 24:56.101
Maybe they're trying
to smoke them out.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.517
That's the problem.

24:57.519 --> 24:59.490
Makes them act
with more urgency.

24:59.492 --> 25:01.734
I think it's time Kensi and
Deeks had another chat with Mia.

25:01.736 --> 25:03.589
Find out what she knows
about Gavin's friends.

25:03.591 --> 25:05.732
And enemies.

25:05.734 --> 25:08.009
(rap music playing inside)

25:12.092 --> 25:14.300
Mia?

25:20.290 --> 25:22.516
Mia?

25:23.748 --> 25:24.928
No sign of distress.

25:24.930 --> 25:27.576
Who leaves without
locking their door in L.A.?

25:29.465 --> 25:32.805
No sign she left in a hurry.

25:32.807 --> 25:35.030
Hah! Guess what
instrument she plays.

25:35.032 --> 25:36.685
Uh, drums.

25:36.687 --> 25:38.759
No, electric guitar.

25:38.761 --> 25:40.952
No, no, no--
electric keyboard guitar.

25:40.954 --> 25:42.955
Final answer.

25:42.957 --> 25:44.238
Ooh.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.475
Jumbo violin was going to be
my next guess.

25:46.477 --> 25:48.342
Wow.

25:48.344 --> 25:49.961
Got a goth chick
on the outside

25:49.963 --> 25:51.613
and a sexy nerd
on the inside.

25:51.615 --> 25:52.714
Mm-hmm.

25:52.716 --> 25:54.715
Make that a sexy nerd
with skills.

25:54.717 --> 25:55.833
That's some serious string work

25:55.835 --> 25:57.285
keeping our waitress
up at night.

25:57.287 --> 25:59.287
You can tell that
from a sheet of music?

25:59.289 --> 26:00.671
I grew up playing the violin.

26:00.673 --> 26:02.224
(camera clicks)

26:02.226 --> 26:03.224
What?

26:03.226 --> 26:05.476
Yeah.

26:05.478 --> 26:07.779
I'm only part Neanderthal.

26:09.515 --> 26:10.848
What now?

26:10.850 --> 26:13.133
That Jag felt a little
more balanced.

26:13.135 --> 26:14.235
It's in your head.

26:14.237 --> 26:16.237
Put more air in
that front tire, didn't you?

26:16.239 --> 26:17.322
Give it a rest.

26:17.324 --> 26:19.574
(chuckles)

26:19.576 --> 26:21.860
What is it about this one?

26:21.862 --> 26:24.028
We don't know who
or what's out there.

26:24.030 --> 26:26.782
It doesn't help that Ambrose
is keeping us in the dark.

26:26.784 --> 26:28.833
Can't shake the feeling that
he's hiding something from us.

26:28.835 --> 26:31.502
Hey... I was able to trace
the anonymous tip

26:31.504 --> 26:32.954
to an address in Hollywood.

26:32.956 --> 26:33.955
Where is it?

26:33.957 --> 26:35.173
It's a big abandoned building

26:35.175 --> 26:36.818
surrounded by
empty parking lots.

26:36.820 --> 26:39.018
Address on your phones.

27:01.701 --> 27:03.312
What are you thinking?

27:03.314 --> 27:05.729
Great place for an ambush.

27:25.844 --> 27:27.892
(car alarm wailing)

27:29.739 --> 27:31.250
You okay?

27:31.252 --> 27:33.601
Yeah. You?

27:35.381 --> 27:36.940
Must have been
remote detonated.

27:36.942 --> 27:38.604
No, I set it off
when I checked the lock.

27:38.606 --> 27:41.072
Guess Gavin isn't working alone.

27:41.074 --> 27:42.750
Nate was right.

27:42.752 --> 27:45.000
The FBI got it wrong.

27:56.971 --> 27:58.590
Only way to get ahead
of this terrorist plot

27:58.592 --> 27:59.916
is to figure out the endgame.

27:59.918 --> 28:02.703
The first chemical bomb went
off after a car accident.

28:02.705 --> 28:05.306
It almost killed Gavin and
the woman who rear-ended him.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.984
But the bomb was meant
to detonate somewhere else.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.109
CALLEN:
Second chemical bomb

28:08.111 --> 28:10.007
triggered by a pressure sensor
on the gate.

28:10.009 --> 28:12.545
No one was hurt
by that one either.

28:12.547 --> 28:13.750
Maybe it's by design.

28:13.752 --> 28:14.953
Maybe they're trying
to get our attention.

28:14.955 --> 28:16.024
Could be an extortion scheme.

28:16.026 --> 28:17.245
You know, "This is
what we can do.

28:17.246 --> 28:18.779
"Now you pay us
or the next time,

28:18.781 --> 28:20.592
it's gonna be at the Staples
Center during a Clippers game."

28:20.594 --> 28:22.240
If there is a third,
it may not be

28:22.242 --> 28:23.610
a car bomb like the first two.

28:23.612 --> 28:25.258
Someone's been asking
our biker friends how to make

28:25.260 --> 28:27.516
small compact bombs,
which are much easier to hide.

28:27.518 --> 28:29.445
And take out a specific target.

28:29.447 --> 28:31.390
So the car used in
the second bombing was stolen

28:31.392 --> 28:32.808
after Gavin's arrest.

28:32.810 --> 28:35.233
Ooh, okay, that means
Gavin wasn't acting alone.

28:35.235 --> 28:37.717
We assumed that he used
Mia's phone to call the garage,

28:37.719 --> 28:40.071
but she could have
made those calls herself.

28:40.073 --> 28:43.273
Which, in retrospect,
actually makes much more sense.

28:43.275 --> 28:44.859
We need to find this girl.

28:44.861 --> 28:47.227
NELL: You don't know the half of it.
It's gonna be hard.

28:47.229 --> 28:48.245
Her phone's turned off,

28:48.247 --> 28:49.830
and there's no record
of Mia Jameson

28:49.832 --> 28:51.132
until six years ago.

28:52.567 --> 28:54.001
She created a new identity.

28:54.003 --> 28:55.736
Okay, so what happened
six years ago?

28:55.738 --> 28:58.923
I don't know, but I do
know where to start.

28:58.925 --> 29:01.675
'Cause this is not the
kind of cello you abandon

29:01.677 --> 29:04.262
just because you're
going off the grid.

29:04.264 --> 29:05.646
And my guess
is she's still

29:05.648 --> 29:07.347
having it serviced
at the same place.

29:07.349 --> 29:09.350
All right.
Stay in touch.

29:11.603 --> 29:13.920
Hey, so, um,
how is it, um,

29:13.922 --> 29:15.389
how is it being back?

29:15.391 --> 29:18.391
Oh, actually
it's-it's kind of hard.

29:18.393 --> 29:20.194
- Like, I haven't seen anyone...
- That's great.

29:20.196 --> 29:23.396
Um, so what did you mean
before when you said

29:23.398 --> 29:26.534
I was flirting with you
only in front of Eric?

29:26.536 --> 29:27.768
Oh. Oh, I just...

29:27.770 --> 29:29.035
Because, trust me,

29:29.037 --> 29:32.323
there is nothing going on
there between me and Eric.

29:32.325 --> 29:34.709
I mean, I think of
him like my brother.

29:34.711 --> 29:36.544
- Yeah...
- And I do not have feelings

29:36.546 --> 29:38.653
for my brother.

29:39.955 --> 29:41.730
You think I have
feelings for my brother.

29:41.732 --> 29:43.645
Do I have feelings
for my brother?

29:43.647 --> 29:46.214
Or do I only consciously
think of Eric like my brother

29:46.216 --> 29:48.674
and I subconsciously think
of him as something else?

29:48.676 --> 29:50.784
Is-is that what
you're trying to say?

29:52.719 --> 29:54.757
This was a good talk.

29:54.759 --> 29:56.762
Yeah.

29:56.764 --> 29:58.994
I'm gonna go.

30:00.930 --> 30:02.300
And... yeah.

30:05.623 --> 30:08.121
So do you recognize
this instrument?

30:09.839 --> 30:10.933
Oh!

30:10.934 --> 30:15.430
I string and re-string
this bambina for 15 years.

30:15.432 --> 30:17.383
Do you know its owner,
Mia Jameson?

30:17.385 --> 30:19.381
You mean Jessica, eh?

30:19.383 --> 30:20.632
Um, blonde hair,

30:20.634 --> 30:22.490
dark clothes, nose piercing?

30:22.492 --> 30:23.582
Yeah.

30:23.584 --> 30:26.098
Nose, the nose

30:26.100 --> 30:27.378
thing she puts in.

30:27.380 --> 30:28.596
And I say, why?

30:28.598 --> 30:31.849
Why do you put this-this thing
in your punim, eh?

30:31.851 --> 30:34.018
Does Jessica still own
the cello?

30:34.020 --> 30:35.270
Of course!

30:35.272 --> 30:37.938
I service just last month.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.173
Fantastic.
Come this way.

30:39.175 --> 30:40.142
All right.

30:40.144 --> 30:41.193
I-I don't trust
computers,

30:41.195 --> 30:42.276
at all.

30:42.278 --> 30:43.477
Too many bugs, eh?

30:43.479 --> 30:45.864
I have all my receipts

30:45.866 --> 30:47.948
right here.

30:47.950 --> 30:50.569
Yes.

30:50.571 --> 30:51.703
Proof.

30:51.705 --> 30:53.321
Thank you.

30:53.323 --> 30:55.022
Do you, do you have
any older receipts

30:55.024 --> 30:56.408
that we can look at, by chance?

30:56.410 --> 30:59.543
What is this about, huh?

30:59.545 --> 31:00.712
We think Jessica

31:00.714 --> 31:02.714
needs our help.

31:02.716 --> 31:04.699
We could use your help
to find her.

31:04.701 --> 31:06.885
Hmm.

31:08.087 --> 31:10.599
Mia or Jessica.

31:10.601 --> 31:13.076
Still a good kid.

31:16.510 --> 31:18.300
That address is in Bel Air.

31:18.302 --> 31:20.645
Could be that's
where she grew up.

31:20.647 --> 31:21.650
Thank you.

31:21.652 --> 31:22.737
(line ringing)

31:22.739 --> 31:25.165
Callen, we got an
address for you.

31:31.161 --> 31:33.337
(doorbell rings)

31:36.134 --> 31:39.197
Let's try the back.

31:42.044 --> 31:44.220
(rap music playing)

31:56.863 --> 31:58.704
Uh, excuse me.

31:58.706 --> 32:00.445
A little to the left.

32:00.447 --> 32:02.890
NCIS.

32:02.892 --> 32:04.508
NCIS!

32:04.510 --> 32:05.558
Do you live here?

32:05.560 --> 32:07.394
Uh, no.

32:07.396 --> 32:08.762
I'm just house-sitting

32:08.764 --> 32:11.932
for Mr. and Mrs. Evans
until they return on Sunday.

32:11.934 --> 32:14.101
They're not coming home early,
are they?

32:14.103 --> 32:15.935
We need to
speak to them.

32:15.937 --> 32:17.905
Well, good luck with that.

32:17.907 --> 32:18.972
It's their phone-free
anniversary.

32:18.974 --> 32:20.640
They didn't
even tell me

32:20.642 --> 32:21.909
where they were going.

32:21.911 --> 32:23.994
Do you know their
daughter Jessica?

32:23.996 --> 32:26.162
No. Do you?

32:26.164 --> 32:29.750
All the maid's told me is that
she ran away in high school.

32:29.752 --> 32:31.334
I'm not supposed
to ask about it.

32:31.336 --> 32:33.370
And they haven't
touched her bedroom since.

32:34.289 --> 32:36.655
- It's totally creepy, right?
- Mm.

32:36.657 --> 32:38.042
We're gonna need to
see that bedroom.

32:38.044 --> 32:40.743
Whatever

32:49.754 --> 32:51.854
Check it out.

32:51.856 --> 32:53.190
Law books.

32:53.192 --> 32:56.934
For a high school student?

32:56.936 --> 32:58.748
There's Jessica playing soccer.

32:58.750 --> 33:02.545
Jessica striking her
<i>Charlie's Angels</i> pose.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.754
She was in the
youth orchestra.

33:11.227 --> 33:13.902
Here's Jessica and
her boyfriend, looks like.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.887
He could've been
the reason she ran away.

33:15.889 --> 33:18.717
Maybe why mom and dad

33:18.719 --> 33:20.668
don't want any questions asked.

33:24.001 --> 33:25.639
This is Rafi Janatpour.

33:25.641 --> 33:27.003
He and Mia

33:27.005 --> 33:28.867
were both part of
the Mulholland Youth Orchestra.

33:28.869 --> 33:30.990
Mia played cello,
Rafi first violin.

33:30.992 --> 33:32.318
And...

33:32.320 --> 33:34.442
The FBI arrested him
as a suspected terrorist...

33:34.444 --> 33:35.711
six years ago.

33:35.713 --> 33:37.815
CALLEN:
Where's Rafi now?

33:37.817 --> 33:39.293
ERIC:
Deceased.

33:39.295 --> 33:40.689
While he was awaiting trial

33:40.691 --> 33:43.114
his fellow inmates murdered
him in the name of patriotism.

33:43.116 --> 33:44.721
He was Muslim.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.531
NELL: And we haven't even got
to the juicy part yet.

33:47.533 --> 33:50.294
The FBI agent who
cut his teeth on Rafi's case...

33:50.296 --> 33:51.498
Ambrose.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.911
The plot thickens.

33:52.913 --> 33:55.802
Eric, zoom in
on this picture?

33:57.650 --> 34:00.171
ERIC: FBI identified this guy
as Zachary Cole.

34:00.173 --> 34:01.584
Deeks.

34:01.586 --> 34:04.026
That's the busboy from
the diner where Mia works,

34:04.028 --> 34:05.792
only he said his name
was Adam Malnick.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.445
Searching for him now.

34:08.684 --> 34:10.870
Okay, it looks like
Zachary Cole

34:10.871 --> 34:14.308
became Adam Malnick
six years ago.

34:14.310 --> 34:16.645
He changed his identity
the same time Mia did.

34:16.647 --> 34:18.081
So they were working
together all this time

34:18.083 --> 34:19.449
and Rafi was
the common denominator.

34:19.452 --> 34:21.286
CALLEN: Mia and Adam think
that the FBI arrested

34:21.288 --> 34:23.054
an innocent man when
they put Rafi behind bars.

34:23.056 --> 34:24.909
KENSI: An innocent man
who's now dead.

34:24.911 --> 34:27.545
This was never about terrorism.

34:27.547 --> 34:29.550
These two are out for revenge.

34:38.188 --> 34:39.742
DEEKS: I doubt Adam's
gonna try to sell us

34:39.743 --> 34:41.025
any memorabilia this time.

34:41.027 --> 34:42.328
KENSI:
I know.

34:42.330 --> 34:45.745
We should've taken it
when we had the chance.

34:45.746 --> 34:47.074
You mean before we realized

34:47.076 --> 34:49.396
he was a revenge-seeking
psychopath?

34:49.398 --> 34:51.701
Yeah, that was our window.

34:58.939 --> 35:01.024
(grunts)

35:02.052 --> 35:03.783
Sounds like you
dropped something.

35:03.785 --> 35:05.972
Hope you don't have
to pay for what you break.

35:05.974 --> 35:08.748
Well done, Agents,
very well done.

35:08.750 --> 35:09.927
I'd give you a slow clap,

35:09.929 --> 35:11.054
but my hands are tied.

35:11.056 --> 35:12.484
You find this amusing?

35:12.486 --> 35:15.228
Yeah, a little bit.

35:18.005 --> 35:19.435
Step up.

35:21.791 --> 35:23.506
You enjoy
terrorizing people?

35:23.508 --> 35:26.334
Making them scared to
step outside in the morning?

35:26.336 --> 35:27.952
You're giving me
too much credit, man.

35:27.954 --> 35:30.488
I just built
the bombs, all right?

35:30.490 --> 35:33.007
It was the FBI
and the media

35:33.009 --> 35:34.375
that went through
all the trouble

35:34.377 --> 35:35.877
of telling
everybody about him.

35:35.879 --> 35:37.361
Where's Mia?

35:37.363 --> 35:41.048
She's exactly where
she's supposed to be.

35:41.050 --> 35:43.734
Where is Mia?!

35:43.736 --> 35:45.002
I don't know.

35:45.004 --> 35:48.923
But Agent Ambrose might.

35:48.925 --> 35:50.525
Why would Ambrose know?

35:50.527 --> 35:51.893
'Cause he's Mia's target.

35:53.061 --> 35:55.430
(line ringing)

35:55.432 --> 35:57.398
This is FBI Agent Jonas Ambrose.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.066
I can't come
to the phone right now,

35:59.068 --> 36:01.736
but leave a message,
I'll call you back.

36:01.738 --> 36:03.825
Straight to voicemail.

36:03.827 --> 36:05.403
(line ringing)

36:05.405 --> 36:06.961
Yeah.
Eric.

36:06.963 --> 36:09.476
Mia must have baited Ambrose
into meeting her.

36:09.478 --> 36:11.177
He's not answering
his phone.

36:11.180 --> 36:14.100
I'm using Ambrose's cell phone
to track him now.

36:15.553 --> 36:17.112
He's got an encrypted FBI phone.

36:17.114 --> 36:18.386
It's gonna take me a minute.

36:18.389 --> 36:20.034
If we find Ambrose,
we find Mia.

36:20.036 --> 36:23.293
If we find Mia
we find the third bomb.

36:23.295 --> 36:24.551
Okay...

36:24.553 --> 36:25.826
here's Jessica and Rafi,

36:25.828 --> 36:28.106
but I don't see Adam
in the orchestra picture.

36:28.108 --> 36:30.631
ERIC: Maybe he wasn't
in the orchestra.

36:30.633 --> 36:33.081
Maybe they all went
to high school together.

36:33.083 --> 36:35.949
But his phone has
the orchestra sticker on it.

36:35.950 --> 36:37.623
Well, maybe it wasn't his phone.

36:37.624 --> 36:39.436
So the FBI arrested Rafi

36:39.438 --> 36:41.607
because they linked
his cell phone

36:41.609 --> 36:43.466
to conversations
about chemical bombs.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.124
Somebody else could've
made the call

36:45.126 --> 36:46.102
using Rafi's phone.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.171
Like this punk.

36:47.173 --> 36:48.736
Could've framed Rafi
to take the blame.

36:48.738 --> 36:51.012
He could be doing
the same thing to Mia now.

36:51.014 --> 36:52.813
This time she's
the innocent victim.

36:52.814 --> 36:54.499
You're the one that used Mia's
phone to call the garage

36:54.501 --> 36:55.449
this morning, aren't you?

36:55.451 --> 36:58.314
NELL:
Guys, Jessica Evans, aka Mia,

36:58.316 --> 37:00.933
filed petition after petition
with the courts

37:00.935 --> 37:02.243
until Rafi was killed.

37:02.245 --> 37:03.666
Mia's law books.

37:03.668 --> 37:06.270
She tried to prove
Rafi's innocence.

37:07.221 --> 37:09.267
And this guy?

37:09.269 --> 37:12.272
He pretended he was crushed
by Rafi's unjust murder.

37:12.274 --> 37:15.412
Then he recruits Mia to help
him prove a point to the FBI.

37:15.414 --> 37:16.744
They go underground,
trick the FBI

37:16.746 --> 37:19.185
into arresting
an easy mark like Gavin...

37:19.187 --> 37:22.376
then detonate another bomb
to prove the FBI wrong.

37:22.378 --> 37:23.947
Tell us when
we're getting warm.

37:23.949 --> 37:25.159
NATE:
Guys, Mia

37:25.161 --> 37:27.976
would want the FBI
to admit its mistake,

37:27.978 --> 37:29.545
if it didn't hurt anyone.

37:29.547 --> 37:31.425
Except for the fact
you took too much pleasure

37:31.427 --> 37:32.838
in tricking the FBI
the first time.

37:32.840 --> 37:33.785
You want to do
it again, huh?

37:33.787 --> 37:35.198
CALLEN:
Even if it meant

37:35.200 --> 37:36.611
sacrificing Mia.

37:36.613 --> 37:38.489
Where'd you plant
the other bomb?!

37:43.477 --> 37:45.304
Well, that would take all the...

37:45.306 --> 37:47.167
fun out of it.

37:48.996 --> 37:50.242
Found him.

37:50.244 --> 37:51.789
At least his phone.

37:51.791 --> 37:54.348
Ambrose is headed
to Verdugo Park.

37:54.350 --> 37:55.395
We're on our way.

37:55.397 --> 37:57.008
Get in the car.

37:58.605 --> 38:00.873
ERIC: Ambrose is headed
to the baseball field.

38:00.875 --> 38:02.141
Does he have
anyone with him?

38:02.143 --> 38:03.342
That'd be a negative.

38:03.344 --> 38:05.109
Because he thinks Mia's
just there to talk.

38:05.111 --> 38:06.528
Mia probably
is there to talk.

38:06.530 --> 38:07.479
She doesn't know Adam's

38:07.481 --> 38:08.679
planted a bomb on her.

38:08.681 --> 38:10.531
So where would he
have put it?

38:10.533 --> 38:13.484
Mia would want the FBI
to admit its mistake.

38:13.486 --> 38:15.903
That Rafi was innocent.

38:15.905 --> 38:18.456
And she'd want that
on record.

38:18.458 --> 38:21.039
Tape recorder.

38:24.831 --> 38:26.685
(phone rings)

38:26.687 --> 38:28.836
We're at the park.
Which way, Eric?

38:28.838 --> 38:29.780
Baseball field.

38:29.782 --> 38:30.988
Straight ahead.
Guys,

38:30.990 --> 38:32.198
look for a tape recorder.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.953
I think that's where
the bomb could be.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.240
She's got something
behind her back.

38:44.317 --> 38:45.705
Callen, what the hell?

38:45.707 --> 38:46.743
Ambrose, she's got a bomb.

38:46.745 --> 38:48.233
SAM: Mia, do not turn
on that recorder.

38:48.235 --> 38:49.672
KENSI:
Listen to us, Mia.

38:49.674 --> 38:51.598
I already have.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.690
CALLEN:
Mia, do not move.

38:53.692 --> 38:55.614
Do not take your finger
off that button.

38:55.616 --> 38:56.920
It's gonna be okay, Mia.

38:56.922 --> 38:58.209
I'm gonna take
it off you.

38:58.211 --> 39:00.886
Do not let it go
until I've got it.

39:03.198 --> 39:04.150
SAM:
Okay.

39:04.152 --> 39:05.991
Run, Mia! Run!
Go.

39:05.993 --> 39:07.113
You got a plan?

39:07.115 --> 39:08.753
- Nope.
- You gonna throw it?

39:08.755 --> 39:10.511
Nope.

39:10.513 --> 39:12.319
- Do we all need to be here?
- Nope.

39:12.321 --> 39:15.080
AMBROSE: I'll, uh,
take care of Mia.

39:17.458 --> 39:19.465
SAM: I need something
to hold the button.

39:19.467 --> 39:21.859
A bobby pin--
I got it, I got it.

39:33.192 --> 39:34.781
You guys know what
you're doing?

39:34.783 --> 39:36.705
Got no idea.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.112
Okay.

39:41.476 --> 39:43.567
Back away. Back away.

39:44.322 --> 39:45.710
Go, go, go, go.
Back away.

39:45.712 --> 39:48.329
KENSI: Come on, Sam.
Sam, come on.

39:48.331 --> 39:49.881
Sam, let's go!

40:01.793 --> 40:02.844
MIA: I swear, I swear
I didn't know

40:02.846 --> 40:05.346
it was a bomb.
Adam just gave it to me.

40:05.348 --> 40:07.181
I just wanted the
FBI to admit that

40:07.183 --> 40:08.799
Rafi was innocent.

40:08.801 --> 40:09.834
SAM:
Mia, Mia.

40:09.836 --> 40:10.902
We know.

40:11.970 --> 40:14.805
Ambrose, here,
is gonna admit it on record.

40:14.807 --> 40:16.574
And then he's gonna
release Gavin.

40:19.995 --> 40:22.997
SAM: We're gonna put that guy in jail
for as long as we can.

40:22.999 --> 40:25.716
All this time
I believed him.

40:25.718 --> 40:28.336
And he was the one responsible

40:28.338 --> 40:30.171
for Rafi's death.

40:31.573 --> 40:32.722
MIA: I don't care
if I go to jail,

40:32.724 --> 40:33.925
I'll do whatever it takes

40:33.927 --> 40:36.010
to make sure Adam pays
for what he did.

40:44.814 --> 40:46.390
We good?

40:46.392 --> 40:48.091
Uh...

40:48.093 --> 40:50.177
not so fast.

40:50.179 --> 40:51.822
He apologize to you?

40:51.823 --> 40:54.074
To me? No.

40:56.617 --> 40:59.002
On behalf of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation,

40:59.004 --> 41:02.025
I apologize for...

41:02.027 --> 41:04.024
getting you into this mess.

41:04.026 --> 41:06.174
SAM: I didn't hear
any heart.

41:06.176 --> 41:08.946
He's the tin man
in a suit.

41:11.668 --> 41:13.784
What's gonna happen to Mia?

41:13.786 --> 41:15.412
We're questioning her,
but given her history,

41:15.414 --> 41:17.679
it's unlikely that we'll
press any charges.

41:17.681 --> 41:19.309
One more thing...

41:20.419 --> 41:21.929
Thanks, I don't
need a shrink, man.

41:21.931 --> 41:24.088
Well, maybe a friend.

41:34.965 --> 41:37.703
Kudos, Mr. Callen.

41:37.705 --> 41:39.066
Assistant Director Granger

41:39.068 --> 41:41.722
sends you a gold star.

41:41.724 --> 41:44.013
Ah, well, send it to Mia.

41:44.015 --> 41:46.066
She devoted her life
to clearing Rafi's name.

41:46.068 --> 41:48.224
She devoted her whole
life to the truth.

41:48.226 --> 41:49.835
She's a kindred spirit.

41:49.837 --> 41:50.733
ERIC:
Headed home?

41:50.735 --> 41:52.957
Yep. No plans tonight.

41:52.959 --> 41:54.983
Or any other night.

41:54.985 --> 41:58.287
For the foreseeable future.

41:58.289 --> 41:59.338
Okay.

41:59.340 --> 42:00.522
Unless of course

42:00.524 --> 42:02.675
the monster truck rally
comes back into town.

42:02.677 --> 42:04.994
Uh, Kensi and I
went last night.

42:04.996 --> 42:06.762
It was pretty awesome.

42:10.468 --> 42:11.851
Good night.

42:11.853 --> 42:14.020
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:14.022 --> 42:15.505
Night.

42:17.475 --> 42:19.277
Monster truck rally?

42:19.279 --> 42:21.478
(scoffs)
Hmm.

42:23.814 --> 42:25.683
HETTY: <i>I'm surprised I didn't</i>
<i>bump into them.</i>
