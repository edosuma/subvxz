00:01.060 --> 00:04.097
(siren wailing)

00:04.130 --> 00:05.961
YEAH, THE KIDS ARE
REALLY EXCITED.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.433
ZOE'S GONNA TAKE 'EM
UP TO HER PARENTS' COTTAGE

00:07.470 --> 00:09.131

00:09.170 --> 00:12.003
I MEAN, THE WORD IS IZZY'S GOT

00:12.040 --> 00:13.576
BUT I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

00:13.610 --> 00:16.477
IF IT'S THE KID I'M THINKING OF,
SHE COULD DO WAY BETI'ER.

00:16.510 --> 00:17.977
HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:18.010 --> 00:19.875
HANG A LEFI' HERE, AND WE'LL

00:19.920 --> 00:21.876

00:27.960 --> 00:29.723
GREAT BUNCH.

HERE'S A STORY FOR YA.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.818

00:32.860 --> 00:34.157
(radio chatter)

00:34.200 --> 00:35.326
YOU DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.294
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:37.330 --> 00:38.797
EPSTEIN, I THINK YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU SET YOUR MIND TO,

00:38.830 --> 00:40.661
BUT TONIGHT--

YEAH, ACTUALLY, I DO.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.741
BY ALL MEANS.

01:35.690 --> 01:38.579

THERE'D BE FOUR OF US.

01:38.630 --> 01:41.326

01:46.440 --> 01:48.169
(loud screech)

01:48.200 --> 01:49.701

YOUR KEYS"?

02:13.860 --> 02:16.624
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF FUNNY.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.864
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE SOME COPS,

02:17.900 --> 02:19.891
THEY'LL LEAVE THEIR KEYS

02:19.940 --> 02:22.204

02:32.010 --> 02:34.046
OHH! NO!

UM, YOU WANNA GRAB
THE NEWSPAPER,

03:16.490 --> 03:17.923

03:17.960 --> 03:19.848
I-I CAN'T. I-I GOTTA GO.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.856

03:31.970 --> 03:33.107
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M IN DECENT SHAPE.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.677
I'D SAY I GOT
ANOTHER GOOD 40 YEARS.

03:35.710 --> 03:37.143
EVEN THEN, I HEAR
THEY GOT PILLS FOR THAT.

03:37.180 --> 03:38.499
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

03:38.550 --> 03:39.619
(sighs)

03:39.650 --> 03:42.039
RUNNING OUT THE DOOR
WITH LAST NIGHT'S CLOTHES?

03:42.080 --> 03:44.981
IT--IT'S LIKE WE'RE...
WE'RE TEENAGERS.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.556
AND THAT'S A BAD THING?

03:46.590 --> 03:48.057
WELL, I GUESS NOT.

03:48.090 --> 03:51.924
MCNALLY, WE GOT THE WHOLE DAY

04:28.960 --> 04:30.928
UGH, YEAH.
BIG RAID IN RIVERDALE.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.528
$2.2 MILLION IN HEROIN,

04:34.540 --> 04:37.805
OH, YEAH? HOW LONG IT TAKE YOU

04:37.840 --> 04:40.434
IT'S NOT ABOUT SPEED.
IT'S ABOUT SAFETY.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.299
REALLY?

04:42.240 --> 04:46.916
LET'S JUST SAY

04:46.950 --> 04:50.215
OH, HEY. I HEARD YOU GUYS LOST

04:57.290 --> 04:59.952
SUICIDE DRILLS? PFFT.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.297
(chuckles)

05:01.330 --> 05:04.720

05:17.780 --> 05:20.214
THAT, UH, DECAF?

05:20.250 --> 05:21.376
ONE CUP WON'T HURT.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.411
UNH-UNH.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

05:23.450 --> 05:26.783
NOT ACCORDING

05:26.820 --> 05:29.152
(pours coffee)

05:29.190 --> 05:30.327
DECAF.
MM-HMM.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.554
OKAY? SEE YOU IN PARADE.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.399
THANK YOU.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.556

05:34.600 --> 05:37.728
(radio chatter)

05:37.770 --> 05:40.637
(gun clicking)

05:40.670 --> 05:42.467
IT'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW,
THESE GLOCKS.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.909
YOU REALLY GOTTA COMMIT.

05:45.610 --> 05:48.374
OUR SERVICE WEAPONS
OVERSEAS--

05:48.410 --> 05:50.241
VERY SENSITIVE
LITTLE TRIGGERS.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.804
YOU JUST NEED TO USE
THE TIP OF YOUR FINGER.

05:51.850 --> 05:54.273
WOW. IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO IMPRESS ME?

05:54.320 --> 05:56.686
DEPENDS. DID IT WORK?

05:56.720 --> 05:59.143
YOU REALLY HAVEN'T CHANGED,
HAVE YOU?

05:59.190 --> 06:00.919
WELL, IN FAIRNESS, I'M IN
SLIGHTLY BETTER SHAPE NOW,

06:00.960 --> 06:02.780
ALTHOUGH YOU PROBABLY
HAVEN'T NOTICED.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.956
ALL I'VE NOTICED IS THAT

06:03.990 --> 06:07.255
ONE OF US GREW UP
AND BECAME A REAL COP,

06:07.300 --> 06:13.034
AND THE OTHER'S JUST A BOY
POLISHING HIS LITTLE GUN.

06:13.070 --> 06:15.766
CAREFUL IT DOESN'T
GO OFF IN YOUR HAND.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.577
(radio chatter)

06:19.610 --> 06:22.579
NOW YOU ALL KNOW--
THE WHOLE CITY KNOWS BY NOW--

06:22.610 --> 06:24.077
THAT EPSTEIN AND SHAW

06:24.110 --> 06:25.748
HAD THEIR SQUAD STOLEN OUT
FROM UNDER THEM.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.247
(man imitates pig squeal,
laughter)

06:27.280 --> 06:28.417
(grunts)

06:28.450 --> 06:29.917
I'M GLAD YOU ALL THINK
IT'S A JOKE

06:29.950 --> 06:32.043
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT 15
LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW--A JOKE.

06:34.460 --> 06:37.452
TECH TEAM TRACKED
THE SQUAD'S GPS AND FOUND IT...

06:37.490 --> 06:38.627
REMOVED.

06:38.660 --> 06:39.957
SO OBVIOUSLY,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.854
THESE GUYS--
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.095
WELL, ACTUALLY, SIR,
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

06:44.130 --> 06:45.722
UH, DOV AND I FOUND OUT
HOW TO DO IT ONLINE.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.135
YOU KNOW, IN CASE
IT EVER CAME UP--

06:47.170 --> 06:48.296
ARE YOU DONE, DIAZ?

06:48.340 --> 06:49.932
YES, SIR.

06:49.970 --> 06:51.699
I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU GUYS

06:51.740 --> 06:53.970
THAT CAR IS EQUIPPED
WITH A VERY EXPENSIVE COMPUTER

06:54.010 --> 06:55.898
AND A LOADED SHOTGUN.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.373
AND IF THEY FIGURED OUT
HOW TO REMOVE THIS,

06:57.410 --> 07:00.470
YOU CAN BE DAMN SURE THEY'RE
GONNA UNLOCK THAT WEAPON.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.011
LAST WEEK OF EXAMS.
ANNUAL SCAVENGER HUNT.

07:03.050 --> 07:04.381
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS
ALL OVER THE CITY

07:04.420 --> 07:06.217
ARE WORKING TO STEAL A BUNCH
OF STUFF THEY DON'T NEED,

07:06.250 --> 07:08.013
BY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.618
THE LIST IS ALWAYS A SECRET.

07:09.660 --> 07:12.891
LAST YEAR'S LIST INCLUDED
AN OWL FROM THE ZOO,

07:12.930 --> 07:14.249
27's DIVISIONAL SIGN,

07:14.300 --> 07:16.154
AND A VERY LARGE
PAPIER-MACHE MOOSE.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.861
IT'S USUALLY PRETTY HARMLESS.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.788
NOT TODAY.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.764
THESE ASSCLOWNS HAVE ONE OF
MY CARS AND ONE OF MY GUNS,

07:22.810 --> 07:23.936
AND I WANT IT BACK.

07:23.970 --> 07:26.507
SO LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND FIND THEM.

07:32.550 --> 07:34.677
I DID SAY "USUALLY."

07:34.720 --> 07:36.210
YEAH, AND I SAID,
"NOT TODAY."

07:39.220 --> 07:40.380
(clears throat)

07:43.860 --> 07:45.384
SAM, UM...

07:45.430 --> 07:47.728
(radio chatter)

07:47.760 --> 07:48.897
ABOUT THIS MORNING,

07:48.930 --> 07:50.466
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN
TO FREAK YOU OUT.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.865
YOU DID NOT.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.834
WELL, YOU DISAPPEARED
PRETTY FAST.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.997
WELL, I HAD PLANS
TO KICK JERRY'S ASS.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.305
AND, YES, I WAS TRYING TO AVOID
THE INEVITABLE CONVERSATION,

07:59.340 --> 08:00.830
BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS "NO."

08:00.880 --> 08:01.938
(radio chatter)

08:01.980 --> 08:05.143
I AM NOT GOING TO...
A YOGA CLASS WITH YOU.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.444
OKAY. (chuckles)

08:07.480 --> 08:10.415
I ASKED YOU ABOUT YOGA
ONE TIME.

08:10.450 --> 08:12.611
TWICE. TWICE.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.957
BUT I STILL STAND BY IT.

08:13.990 --> 08:15.855
I MEAN, I THINK THAT
YOU'D REALLY LIKE IT.

08:15.890 --> 08:18.324
IT'S GOOD FOR STRESS.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.850
(tires screech, horn honks)

08:19.900 --> 08:21.094
OH!

08:21.130 --> 08:22.358
AND THE WINNER IS...

08:22.400 --> 08:24.220
(siren wailing)

08:24.270 --> 08:25.396
(tires screech)

08:25.430 --> 08:28.638
1505, UH,
SOUTHBOUND ON GYWNNE.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.763
UH, WE'RE IN PURSUIT
OF A SILVER S.U.V.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.402
(siren continues wailing)

08:32.440 --> 08:35.432
(tires screech)

08:36.510 --> 08:40.048
(horn blares)

08:40.080 --> 08:42.173
THAT'S RIGHT, BUDDY.
NOWHERE TO GO.

08:42.220 --> 08:43.380
IT'S OVER.

08:45.190 --> 08:48.114
(scoffs)
GUESS HE DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.858
OKAY, BOOST ME UP.
GO.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.629
(grunts)

09:03.870 --> 09:06.259
(dog barks)

09:07.610 --> 09:09.805

10:06.700 --> 10:08.236
THE LAST THREE YEARS,
WHERE THEY DUMPED THE STUFF.

10:08.270 --> 10:10.409

SOME ALTERNATIVES,

10:10.440 --> 10:12.670

PLAYING THIS SCAVENGER HUNT.

10:12.710 --> 10:15.577

10:23.620 --> 10:26.339
I'M NOT YOUR THERAPIST,
EPSTEIN.

10:26.390 --> 10:29.018
LOOK, THIS ONE IS ON ME, TOO.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.187
ALL RIGHT? EVERYBODY SCREWS UP
ONCE IN A WHILE.

10:31.230 --> 10:35.121
IT JUST HAPPENS THAT YOUR
"ONCE IN A WHILE" HAPPENS...

10:35.160 --> 10:36.661
A LITTLE MORE OFTEN.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.691
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
WHAT COULD YOU DO, YOU KNOW?

10:38.730 --> 10:39.936
CAN'T ALL BE POSTER BOYS.
LOOK AT THIS.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.392

THANK YOU FOR POKING AT IT

10:58.620 --> 11:00.019
JUST TO MAKE SURE.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.311
YOU DIDN'T DRAW ON HIM. WHY?

11:01.360 --> 11:02.782
(horn honks in distance)

11:02.830 --> 11:04.718
HE'S A KID.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.297
WHAT? I THOUGHT HE WAS PART
OF THE SCAVENGER HUNT.

11:07.330 --> 11:08.422

WE GOT MAYBE $4,000,
$5,000 IN CASH

11:16.640 --> 11:18.505
AND A WHOLE LOT OF BLOOD
IN THE CAR.

11:18.540 --> 11:21.907
DAMN. THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA HURT
THE RESALE VALUE.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.771
WELL, SUSPECT WAS BEAT UP
PRETTY BAD.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.209
SAID HE HAD TO GET SOMEWHERE.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.377
AND IT'S PROBABLY TOO EASY
IF IT WAS THE HOSPITAL, HUH?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.980

11:30.020 --> 11:32.580

AND YOUR SUSPECT WAS MALE?

11:36.930 --> 11:38.784

11:38.830 --> 11:40.991

REALLY MEAN PARENTS.

IT'S FOR WESTLAKE COLLEGIATE.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.625

11:45.670 --> 11:47.968
OH, RICH KIDS. MY FAVORITE.

11:52.310 --> 11:53.436
YOU GUYS GO TO THE SCHOOL

11:53.480 --> 11:55.971

WITH THE OWNER.

11:56.010 --> 11:57.477

11:57.510 --> 11:59.444
(scoffs)
IT'S A LOT OF BLOOD.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.313
YEAH, I FEEL BAD.
I'M SURE HE'S A REAL ANGEL.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.011

12:04.050 --> 12:06.610
OKAY, SO YOU'RE GONNA BE ALONE

12:06.650 --> 12:07.787
YEAH. YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

I REALLY DON'T THINK

12:23.870 --> 12:25.360

OF WIN-WIN.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.002

15:39.270 --> 15:41.238
BOYFRIEND? LAB PARTNER?

15:41.270 --> 15:43.158

16:31.690 --> 16:33.612
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ON THE LIST.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.355
YOU NEED TO FOCUS, OKAY?

GUYS WHO ORGANIZE THE HUNT.

16:44.900 --> 16:45.969
THEY'RE LEGENDS.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.968
WELL, DO THESE LEGENDS
HAVE NAMES?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.059
NOBODY KNOWS WHO THEY ARE.
THEY'RE LIKE BATMAN AND ROBIN,

16:50.110 --> 16:51.964
BUT, YOU KNOW, COOLER.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.477
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

THREATEN TO CHARGE HIM
WITH FRAUD.

17:26.410 --> 17:28.298
BOBBY ALVEREZ.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.808
LOCAL BUSINESS OWNER.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.876
HALF THE STOLEN GOODS ON
THE EAST SIDE COME THROUGH HERE.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.717
SO IT'S A CASH BUSINESS.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.184
I KNEW YOU PAID ATTENTION
IN CLASS.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.346
SAMMY.
J.T.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.516
WHO'S THIS?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.289
OFFICER MCNALLY, J.T. BRAGA.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.356
NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU TWO NEED SOMETHING?

17:44.390 --> 17:45.982
WE'RE HERE ABOUT
A STOLEN CAR.

17:46.030 --> 17:48.351
YOU MEAN THE SQUAD
THAT GOT BOOSTED LAST NIGHT?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.526
THAT'S GOTTA HURT.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.788
YEAH, A DIFFERENT CAR.

17:50.830 --> 17:52.468
OH.
WE NEED TO TALK TO BOBBY.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.637
HE'S NOT HERE.

17:53.670 --> 17:55.297
WELL, HIS--HIS CAR'S
RIGHT THERE.

17:55.340 --> 17:58.901
YOU MIND IF I GO IN,
CHECK HIS OFFICE?

17:58.940 --> 18:01.079
YOU GOT A WARRANT?
NO, BUT I CAN GET ONE.

18:01.110 --> 18:02.304
BUT THEN IT GETS COMPLICATED.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.978
DETECT IVES ARE GONNA WANT IN,
MAJOR CRIME.

18:04.010 --> 18:05.568
PRETTY SOON, BOBBY'S TH ROWING
A BIG OL' PARTY

18:05.610 --> 18:08.215
HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.877
JUST FIVE MINUTES
OF HIS TIME.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.138
YOU CAN CALL HIM DOWN HERE
YOURSELF.

18:12.190 --> 18:14.215
(pats leg)

18:14.260 --> 18:16.512
(beep)
(clears throat)

18:16.560 --> 18:18.551
(phone rings)

18:18.590 --> 18:20.057
YOU SEEN HIM TODAY?

18:20.090 --> 18:21.227

18:21.260 --> 18:23.296
NOT SINCE THIS MORNING.

18:23.330 --> 18:24.467

18:24.500 --> 18:26.058
HEY, BOBBY, YOU BACK HERE?

18:26.100 --> 18:29.490

18:33.480 --> 18:34.606

18:34.640 --> 18:36.528
BOBBY?

18:36.580 --> 18:37.774

SAM.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.441
(pounds on door)
BOBBY.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.913
LOOKS LIKE BLOOD.
YOU GOT A KEY?

18:46.950 --> 18:48.110
NO.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.325
(J.T.) BOBBY!

18:58.130 --> 18:59.563
(static)
1505.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.830
WE NEED A MEDIC

19:01.870 --> 19:03.098
(static)

19:03.140 --> 19:04.767
HE'S ALIVE.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.835
(woman) Copy that, 1505.
An ambulance is on its way.

19:06.870 --> 19:08.508
(static)

19:10.380 --> 19:13.076
***

19:13.110 --> 19:15.544
(Nick) DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THIS WAS HERE. IT'S NICE.

19:15.580 --> 19:18.879
THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT YOU HERE, NICK.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.979
SUGAR BEACH.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.784
IT'S A WHIMSICAL NEW ADDITION
TO THE CITY'S EDGE.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.821
A PLAYFUL DESTINATION
TO WHILE AWAY THE AFTERNOON

19:25.860 --> 19:27.555
WITH OLD FRIENDS--
OKAY, FINE. FINE.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.488
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

19:29.530 --> 19:30.758
I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
LOOKING FOR THE SQUAD CAR.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.926
WELL, WE ARE.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.029
CHRIS E-MAILED ME
THE SCAVENGER HUNT LIST,

19:34.070 --> 19:35.992
AND THOSE UMBRELLAS ARE ON IT.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.736
OKAY. SO WE HANG BACK, WAIT FOR
SOME DUMB KID TO GRAB ONE.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.408
HIT THE SOFT TARGETS.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.977
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
(static)

19:43.010 --> 19:45.808
(amplified voice) HEY! CASANOVA,
HER FACE IS NOT YOUR LUNCH.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.613
GET A JOB AND GET A ROOM.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.049
(static)

19:49.080 --> 19:52.083
WOW.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.054
MAYBE I DIDN'T CHANGE,
BUT YOU SURE HAVE.

19:54.090 --> 19:55.512
WHY?
'CAUSE I'M DOING MY JOB?

19:55.560 --> 19:57.221
NO, 'CAUSE YOU USED
TO BE FUN.

19:57.260 --> 19:58.659
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
YOU WERE ALWAYS A BITCH.

19:58.690 --> 20:00.021
JUST...

20:00.060 --> 20:02.096
NOT LIKE THIS.

20:02.130 --> 20:05.167
I MUST SAY, I KINDA MISS
THE OLD GAIL.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.758
REALLY?

20:06.800 --> 20:09.166
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T MISS YOU
AT ALL.

20:12.070 --> 20:15.039
(siren wailing)

20:16.080 --> 20:19.106
LOOKS LIKE THE KID WAS
ROBBING THE LOCKBOX,

20:19.150 --> 20:21.539
PRYING IT OPEN WITH THAT,
I GUESS.

20:21.580 --> 20:24.185
THEN ALVEREZ WALKS IN,
SURPRISE,

20:24.220 --> 20:25.346
CATCHES HIM IN THE ACT.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.516
YEAH.

20:26.550 --> 20:29.587
YEAH. IT'S NOT EXACTLY
A PRECISION JOB.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.224
NOT EXACTLY
A PRECISION CRIMINAL.

20:31.260 --> 20:34.058
NOT IF HE'S STUPID ENOUGH
TO ROB BOBBY ALVEREZ.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.397
ALL RIGHT, SO...

20:36.300 --> 20:38.666
KID WALKS IN,

20:38.700 --> 20:39.997
AND HE BEATS ALVEREZ,

20:40.030 --> 20:42.294
HE LOCKS THIS DOOR,

20:42.340 --> 20:44.069
AND THEN HE RUNS
OUT THAT ONE.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.328
BACK LOT. THAT'S PROBABLY
WHERE HE GOT THE CAR.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.507
YEAH.

20:47.540 --> 20:48.677
(cell phone vibrates)
OH.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.371
(beep)
PRINTS ARE IN FROM THE CAR.

20:51.610 --> 20:53.919
THEY BELONG
TO A WYATT CRIPTON.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.113
WYATT CRIPTON?

20:58.150 --> 21:00.618
YEAH. HE'S AN EMPLOYEE HERE.
HE'S A MECHANIC APPRENTICE.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.059
BUT HE WASN'T WORKING TODAY.

21:02.090 --> 21:03.648
YEAH, IT'S JERRY.

21:03.690 --> 21:05.282
DO YOU KNOW EVERY ONE
OF THESE GUYS HAS A RECORD?

21:05.330 --> 21:07.127
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A BAN K,
MCNALLY.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.151
(horn honks)

21:10.530 --> 21:12.088
(snaps fingers)
WORD'S OUT.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.160
BOBBY'S BROTHER.
HANDLES THE WEST SIDE.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.667
(car door closes)
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:18.710 --> 21:20.063
YOU GUYS BETTER GO PICK HIM UP
BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

21:20.110 --> 21:22.101
I'M GONNA GET THE WARRANT
RIGHT NOW.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.777
WELL, I THINK WE MUST'VE

21:26.810 --> 21:29.244
CHECKED MOST OF THE SPOTS
ON YOUR LIST, EPSTEIN.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.542
NO SQUAD CAR, SO...

21:30.590 --> 21:31.716
MAYBE WE SHOULD CHECK
THE OUTSKIRTS.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.913
(door handle rattling)

21:34.960 --> 21:36.313
DUDE, EASY. RELAX.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.783
WE GOTTA FIND THAT CAR.
WE ARE. WE'RE LOOKING.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.320
IF I DON'T FIND THAT CAR,
I CAN'T STAY WITH SUE.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.851
OKAY. WAIT.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.596
YOU HAD ME, THEN YOU LOST ME.
(helicopter whirring overhead)

21:45.630 --> 21:46.824
CAN WE JUST GO?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.599
NO. I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU LOSE ME, EPSTEIN.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.904
IT MAKES ME FEEL STUPID.
WHICH, FOR THE RECORD, I'M NOT.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.237
ALL RIGHT,
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.079
MORE SCREWUPS LAND ON ME
THAN ANYBODY ELSE, RIGHT?

21:54.110 --> 21:56.078
I'M THAT GUY.

21:56.110 --> 21:57.839
OH, AND YOUR GIRL SUE

21:57.880 --> 22:00.246
PRETTY MUCH KICKS ASS
FOR A LIVING.
PRETTY MUCH.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.542
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
YEAH.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.548
AND YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
HAD YOUR SQUAD CAR BOOSTED

22:03.590 --> 22:05.217
BY A BUNCH OF STUPID TEENAGERS.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.389
THAT'S--THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
CAN--CAN WE GO?
YEAH. YEAH.

22:09.590 --> 22:12.889
BUT LOOK, PAL. (grunts)

22:12.930 --> 22:14.329
LOOK...

22:14.360 --> 22:16.328
LET'S FIND THAT SQUAD CAR.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.863
YEAH? GIVE ME YOUR LIST.
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE YOU GOT.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.335
(sighs) WE REALLY GONNA
KEEP HIM IN HERE?

22:24.370 --> 22:25.530
FRANK'S PISSED.

22:25.570 --> 22:26.707
UNTIL WE FIND THAT SQUAD CAR,

22:26.740 --> 22:28.503
HE'S NOT CUTTING ANYBODY
ANY SLACK.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.201
(scoffs)
I MEAN, HE'S JUST A KID.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.707
HE'S JUST TRYING TO BE COOL.
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.741
WELL, LET'S MAKE SURE,

22:33.780 --> 22:35.975
'CAUSE, UH, THAT CREDIT CARD
HE STOLE--

22:36.020 --> 22:40.241
LESLIE STARZOMSKI HAS
A 15-YEAR-OLD SON NAMED TROY.

22:40.290 --> 22:42.611
GOES TO BRADSHAW.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.183
(buzzer sounds)

22:46.230 --> 22:48.118
'SU P, PLAYERS?
TROY.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.355
(door closes)
DUDE, YOU HAD TO HAVE KNOWN

22:50.400 --> 22:51.822
WE WERE GONNA RUN
THE CREDIT CARD.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.098
WE'VE LEFT A MESSAGE
WITH YOUR MOM,

22:53.130 --> 22:54.836
TOLD HER WHERE
TO COME PICK YOU UP.

22:54.870 --> 22:56.861
SHE GAVE ME HER CREDIT CARD
FOR EMERGENCIES AND STUFF.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.037
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO US
ALL DAY.

22:58.070 --> 22:59.469
WHY SHOULD
WE BELIEVE YOU NOW?

22:59.510 --> 23:02.172
BECAUSE, UH...

23:02.210 --> 23:03.438
(sighs)

23:03.480 --> 23:04.640
SHE'S NOT HERE.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.841
SHE DOESN'T EXACTLY LIVE
IN THE CITY.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.575
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHERE IS SHE?

23:08.620 --> 23:10.349
SHE HAD TO TAKE A JOB
IN KINGSTON A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

23:10.380 --> 23:11.711
JUST FOR A BIT.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.615
SHE WAS DRIVING BACK AND FORTH
EVERY DAY,

23:13.660 --> 23:15.753
BUT IT WAS TOTALLY
WEARING HER OUT.

23:15.790 --> 23:18.054
SO NOW...

23:18.090 --> 23:19.580
SHE JUST COMES BACK
ON WEEKENDS.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.951
SO YOU'RE ALONE
THE REST OF THE TIME?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.924
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
I CAN LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.096
TROY, YOU'RE
IN A POLICE STATION.

23:26.130 --> 23:28.030
IS MY MOM GONNA
GET IN TROUBLE?

23:29.940 --> 23:33.501
OKAY, YOU'RE LYING TO PROTECT
YOUR MOM. I GET THAT.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.269
BUT WHY WOULD YOU STEAL A SIGN?

23:36.910 --> 23:39.105
I DON'T KNOW.
TRYING TO BE BADASS.

23:39.150 --> 23:40.276
YOU PROBABLY THINK
IT'S PATHETIC.

23:40.310 --> 23:42.312
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT'S PATHETIC?

23:42.350 --> 23:44.841
GETTING YOUR SQUAD CAR STOLEN
BY A COUPLE OF TEENAGERS.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.846
BUT ANYTHING YOU CAN DO
TO HELP US...

23:46.890 --> 23:48.915
NOW THAT WOULD BE BADASS.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.178
(sighs)

23:51.230 --> 23:52.959
THEY'VE BEEN SENDING UPDATES
ON TWITTER.

23:52.990 --> 23:55.197
I'M SORRY.
THEY'RE TWEETING ABOUT THIS?

23:55.230 --> 23:56.754
YEAH. BUT THEY'RE USING
FAKE HANDLES.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.064
I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.034
IF TH EY'VE GOT THEIR GEOTAGS
TURNED ON,

24:01.070 --> 24:03.959
I CAN SHOW YOU
WHERE THEY ARE.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.865
LET'S GET HIM HIS PHONE.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.879
CRIPTON'S FILE SAYS THAT
HE'S BEEN IN 22 FOSTER HOMES.

24:09.910 --> 24:11.969
I MEAN, HE'S BARELY
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

24:12.010 --> 24:13.102
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

24:13.150 --> 24:14.947
BAD ATTITUDE.
WHAT, SO IT'S HIS FAULT?

24:14.980 --> 24:16.447
GUY'S BEEN ARRESTED
THREE TIMES.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.617
LOTS OF KIDS GO
INTO FOSTER CARE,

24:17.650 --> 24:19.288
COME OUT JUST FINE.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.351
(Sam) WYATT, IT'S THE POLICE!

24:24.390 --> 24:26.221
WE'RE INSIDE.

24:33.330 --> 24:35.139
(Andy) LOOKS LIKE HE CAME BACK
AND GOT CLEANED UP.

24:36.370 --> 24:39.760
MAYBE HE WANTED
TO LOOK HIS BEST.

24:39.810 --> 24:42.005
GOD, SOME OF THESE PICTURES
ARE REALLY GOOD.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.473
THEY GOT PHOTOGRAPHY CLASSES
IN PRISON.

24:43.510 --> 24:46.206
HE'LL GET IN FREE.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.399
HE'S GOTTA KNOW THAT
THE GUYS FROM THE GARAGE

24:47.450 --> 24:48.769
ARE LOOKING FOR HIM.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.173
WHY WOULD HE RISK
COMING BACK HERE?

24:50.220 --> 24:53.587
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE LEFT
SOMETHING BEHIND--

24:53.620 --> 24:55.383
DRUGS, CASH.

24:56.820 --> 24:57.980
SAM.

25:01.830 --> 25:04.298
(handle clanks, door creaks)

25:08.400 --> 25:09.890
(holsters gun)

25:11.070 --> 25:12.230
(switch click)

25:16.110 --> 25:17.509
IT'S STELLA ALVEREZ.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.847
HE KNOWS HER.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.711
GOT A LITTLE CRUSH
ON THE 3055' DAUGHTER.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.149
SHE'S STILL AT THE SCHOOL.

25:22.180 --> 25:23.477
WHAT IF THAT'S WHERE
HE WAS TRYING TO GET TO?

25:23.520 --> 25:24.646
LET'S CALL THE SCHOOL,
GET 'EM TO FIND HER,

25:24.690 --> 25:26.043
AND HANG ON TO HER
TILL WE GET THERE.

25:26.090 --> 25:27.512
OKAY.

25:27.560 --> 25:34.124
***

25:34.160 --> 25:35.957
[sirens]

25:36.000 --> 25:37.126
APARTM ENT'S EM PTY.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.866
I MEAN, WE ALREADY CALLED
THE SCHOOL,

25:38.900 --> 25:39.924
AND THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR STELLA.

25:39.970 --> 25:43.030
SO WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
STALKER?

25:43.070 --> 25:44.469
HAS HIS EYE
ON THE BOSS' DAUGHTER,

25:44.510 --> 25:46.466
STARTS FOLLOWING HER AROUND,
TAKING HER PICTURE.

25:46.510 --> 25:48.068
BOSS FINDS OUT--

25:48.110 --> 25:50.078
FROM THE PICTURES,
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE KNEW HIM.

25:50.110 --> 25:51.475
MAYBE THE GUYS THERE
KNOW SOMETHING.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.205
NOT A GOOD IDEA.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

25:53.250 --> 25:56.640
BOBBY'S GUYS FIND THE KID
BEFORE WE DO, HE'S DEAD.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.808
SO I WOULD RATHER NOT
MAKE HIM MORE DEAD.

SHE MET UP WITH SOME GUY.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.995

29:02.800 --> 29:04.062

I MEAN, THIS IS BAD.
YOU GUYS STOLE CITY PROPERTY.

29:25.130 --> 29:26.256

MY DAD? OH, MY GOD.
DID HE DO THIS?

29:56.760 --> 29:59.126
HE TOLD ME

HOW THIS WORKS.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.992

I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT HER.

36:21.910 --> 36:24.242
I DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT ANYBODY.

36:25.910 --> 36:27.775

WITH HER.

36:27.810 --> 36:31.644
(filtered voice) I TRIED
TO FIT MYSELF INTO HER LIFE.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.215
I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE
HER HAPPY.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.688
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
IT WASN'T GONNA WORK.

36:38.730 --> 36:39.719

37:11.290 --> 37:14.350
YES, WE'RE DIFFERENT,

37:14.400 --> 37:16.857
SO WE'LL DEAL WITH IT.
(Sighs)

37:16.900 --> 37:18.891
IS THAT WHAT
YOU REALLY THINK?

37:18.930 --> 37:22.388
I THINK YOU WERE READY TO MARRY
SOMEONE ELSE SIX MONTHS AGO.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.192
