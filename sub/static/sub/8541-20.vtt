[knob clicking]

00:18.757 --> 00:19.932
[lock clicks]

00:55.620 --> 00:57.666
Stay where you are
and put your hands in the air.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.408
[dog whimpers]

01:00.495 --> 01:03.106
My safe.
Did you open my safe?

01:05.152 --> 01:06.979
[grunts,
figurine shatters]

01:07.067 --> 01:10.418
Stop!
[gunshots]

[grunts]

01:25.041 --> 01:26.434
Hands behind your back!

01:26.521 --> 01:28.392
Get up. On your feet.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.795
[police radio chatter]

01:42.798 --> 01:44.104
Thanks.

01:44.191 --> 01:47.194
Just a couple bucks, buddy.
Help a guy out.

01:47.281 --> 01:50.153
Just need to know if you saw
anything, sir, anything at all.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.853
Mmm.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.247
I don't know.

01:57.334 --> 02:00.294
Maybe if you tell me
what you're lookin' for

02:00.381 --> 02:01.599
'I could help you out.'

02:01.686 --> 02:04.472
I don't know.
Loud noise, gunshot.

02:04.559 --> 02:07.605
Did you see anyone unusual?
Anyone acting unusually?

02:07.692 --> 02:10.695
Maybe I did.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.480
Or..

02:12.567 --> 02:15.135
...or maybe I didn't.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.224
You give me a couple bucks

02:17.311 --> 02:19.182
maybe help me remember better.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.273
[sighs]

02:23.360 --> 02:24.927
- You got two bucks?
- No. You?

02:25.014 --> 02:26.929
[Van Pelt]
'Looks like
a robbery gone bad.'

02:27.016 --> 02:29.888
Victim's name was Ted Fisher.
He owned the place.

02:29.975 --> 02:32.064
Something's off here.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.631
The alarm was set off
during the break-in

02:33.718 --> 02:35.024
and the killer
still took the time

02:35.111 --> 02:36.852
to tear the place apart?

02:36.939 --> 02:40.943
[Van Pelt]
'Watch the blood.
Rug's pretty soaked.'

02:41.030 --> 02:42.466
[camera shutter clicking]

02:45.426 --> 02:47.602
And if the killer
broke the door entering

02:47.689 --> 02:50.344
why is the victim over here
with his back turned?

02:50.431 --> 02:52.346
- Something's off here.
- That's very astute, Lisbon.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.086
There's more here
than meets the eye.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.914
There you are.
Where have you been?

02:56.001 --> 02:58.047
I haven't been anywhere. I was
out back checking escape routes.

02:58.134 --> 03:00.441
Really? Any clues?

03:00.528 --> 03:03.313
Only that the murderer didn't
find what he was looking for.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.097
And...how do you know that?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.970
Because this whole room
has been torn apart.

03:08.057 --> 03:10.451
You find what you're looking
for, you stop the search, right?

03:10.538 --> 03:12.801
So a part of this room
would be untouched.

03:12.888 --> 03:15.064
Unless he found it in the very
last place he was looking.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.805
Do you know the probability
of finding something

03:16.892 --> 03:18.850
in the last possible place?

03:18.937 --> 03:21.549
It's extremely improbable. Hmm.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.551
I'll see you two
back at the office.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.379
Why are you in a hurry?

03:25.466 --> 03:29.861
Well, as much as I enjoy these
lovely surroundings, Lisbon

03:29.948 --> 03:32.647
we have a job to do.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.214
Am I wrong?

03:35.867 --> 03:37.608
- 'Bye.'
- Bye.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.264
[liquid pours]

03:44.876 --> 03:47.662
Hey, sir. What are you doing
here so late on a Friday night?

03:47.749 --> 03:50.447
My house was burglarized.
I caught him red-handed.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.275
Whoa. You want one of my people
to question him?

03:52.362 --> 03:55.278
No. Sac PD can handle it.
It's a slam dunk.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.802
Come Monday,
when court opens

03:57.889 --> 04:02.242
the man who broke into my house
will be very sorry that he did.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.125
Ah.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.605
Donny Culpepper.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.520
What a surprise
to seeyouhere.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.043
Monday I go before a judge.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.001
You got till then
to get me outta here.

04:23.088 --> 04:26.527
Yeah, well, um...that could be
a little problematic.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.442
Otherwise I will tell everyone

04:28.529 --> 04:32.489
how you hired me
to rob your boss' house.

04:32.576 --> 04:35.449
Well, that's just snitching.
Isn't that against your..

04:35.536 --> 04:36.972
...code of honor?

04:37.059 --> 04:38.234
No.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.674
[theme music]

04:52.379 --> 04:53.554
I paid you very well
on the understanding

04:53.641 --> 04:54.859
that you wouldn't get caught.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.948
Did you at least
get what I wanted?

04:57.035 --> 05:00.387
No. I looked everywhere.
Got into his safe. Nothing.

05:00.474 --> 05:01.779
Just some old coins, a watch

05:01.866 --> 05:03.738
and a Tupperware like
tub thing.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.348
Tupperware.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.872
Did LaRoche say
anything when he found you?

05:07.959 --> 05:09.439
He wanted to know
if I got into the safe.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.962
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothin'.

05:11.049 --> 05:13.922
I threw somethin'
at his head and took off.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.316
Yeah, you really blew this. I
thought you were a professional.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.013
Don't talk down to me.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.450
If you don't get me outta here
by Monday

05:20.537 --> 05:22.713
you're the one who's gonna have
to pay for it. Trust me on that.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.585
[cell phone ringing]
Trust. Yeah, really off
on the good foot

05:24.672 --> 05:27.631
with trust, are we?

05:27.718 --> 05:29.633
- Hi.
- 'Where are you?'

05:29.720 --> 05:31.548
I thought you wanted
to get working on this case.

05:31.635 --> 05:34.072
I-I do. I just ran
across the street

05:34.159 --> 05:36.248
to the, uh, fruit place
to pick up some fresh fruit.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.250
'Flavonoids, it's very good
for logical reasoning'

05:38.338 --> 05:39.991
'and visual memory, you know?'

05:40.078 --> 05:42.864
Very interesting.
Get here quick.

05:42.951 --> 05:45.127
Yep. I'm on my way.

05:47.042 --> 05:49.305
The clock's running,
starting now.

05:52.830 --> 05:56.094
You close your eyes
and count to a hundred.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.618
Thank you.

05:59.968 --> 06:03.232
Fisher owned the repair shop
about a year and a half.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.408
Seemed like a good citizen,
volunteer work

06:05.495 --> 06:07.410
with underprivileged kids
and the homeless.

06:07.497 --> 06:08.803
Dig a little deeper.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.892
Find out what he did
before he bought the shop.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.024
- Will do.
- Hey, boss.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.548
Just talked
to Fisher's girlfriend.

06:14.635 --> 06:15.940
She was at the morgue,
IDing the body.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.507
Kinda upset,
but she agreed to meet us

06:17.594 --> 06:18.726
at the apartment
she shared with Fisher.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.728
- Alright, let's go.
- Okay.

06:20.815 --> 06:24.645
AgentLisbon, a word?

06:24.732 --> 06:28.083
I just discovered that
you investigated my burglar

06:28.170 --> 06:31.347
for a murder about a year ago,
Donny Culpepper.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.783
- Culpepper?
- Donny Culpepper.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.263
I remember him.
He threatened to kill me.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.134
You'll have to narrow it down
a little bit more.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.527
The jewelry store case.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.660
We picked him up,
found him in the hot tub.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.139
I wonder
if there's a connection.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.577
Uh, he's a criminal.
He does wrong things.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.143
Yeah, probably
just a coincidence then.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.623
Mm.

06:46.710 --> 06:49.234
Yeah. Probably.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.803
I'll let you know.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.417
- Is there a connection?
- No.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.463
Absolutely not.

07:00.550 --> 07:01.856
[elevator bell dings]

07:03.771 --> 07:05.947
Oh, damn. I forgot something.
Uh, I'll meet you there.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.339
Forgot what?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.994
Uh, my, uh,
frumbahollymorgansterning.

07:19.830 --> 07:22.006
Miss Blue?

07:22.093 --> 07:24.356
I'm Agent Lisbon.
This is Agent Rigsby.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.837
We're really sorry
for your loss.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.883
Just have
a couple questions for you.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.537
Okay. Sure.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.930
Just a few small things.
Where were you last night?

07:33.017 --> 07:36.151
When it happened?
Um, home, asleep.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.675
I had the early shift
at the animal shelter.

07:38.762 --> 07:42.462
- Do you mind if we talk inside?
- Okay.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.987
Did your boyfriend, Mr. Fisher,
work that late very often?

07:46.074 --> 07:48.685
Sometimes. If he had
a big project he had to finish.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.079
But it's not like work
was his life or anything.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.820
He was in balance.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.996
Right. And, uh,
how long ago did you meet him?

07:55.083 --> 07:57.781
Um, about a year ago.
We met at yoga.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.045
That's weird.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.960
I'm sure I locked that.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.527
Stand back, ma'am.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.365
Clear.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.202
Clear.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.856
Jane was right.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.684
Looks like somebody wanted
something Fisher had.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.207
Call it in. Put somebody
to watch the shop.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.774
If Jane is right,
maybe they'll go back there.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.863
Okay, you got it.

08:35.950 --> 08:39.823
I can't believe
this level of hostility.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.782
There's nothing here
worth stealing.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.131
Nothin'?

08:43.218 --> 08:45.568
Ted and I weren't really
into material stuff.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.788
He spent, like, eight years
in the Peace Corps.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.704
[woman gasps]
Oh, my gosh.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.749
Oh, excuse me.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.796
I'm sorry.
Ma'am, can I ask you a question?

08:55.883 --> 08:58.842
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to
be intrusive. I live upstairs.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.758
There was a break-in here.
Did you see or hear anything?

09:01.845 --> 09:04.369
No. A break-in?
I was at the market.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.546
- Did they steal anything?
- Thank you for your time.

09:06.633 --> 09:07.938
Uh, if you think of anything

09:08.025 --> 09:09.461
you can give me a call
at this number.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.550
Alright.

09:19.123 --> 09:21.169
Okay. Thanks.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.432
Sac PD put a man
on the store.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.086
Check on the girlfriend.

09:25.173 --> 09:28.219
She's got no real alibi
other than being a hippie.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.530
Something bugging you, boss?

09:34.617 --> 09:38.360
Behind us.
Dark late model sedan.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.318
I'm pretty sure I saw it
outside the repair shop.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.190
I think it's following us.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.844
Got it.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.849
And there it goes.
It's probably nothing.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.154
Just a look-alike.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.547
Maybe. Run the plates.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.505
See if you find anything.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.294
Hey.

09:59.381 --> 10:02.036
You're new to me.
Uh, who-who are you now?

10:02.123 --> 10:04.473
Detention Enforcement Officer
O'Donnell.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.258
Guarding the prisoner up to
and until transport.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.609
Gung ho. Good to see.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.001
Well, welcome, O'Donnell.

10:11.088 --> 10:14.526
I'm Patrick Jane.
I work with the CBI.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.876
- Okay.
- No worries.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.094
Uh..

10:17.181 --> 10:19.662
...did you-did you lose this?

10:19.749 --> 10:22.883
A quarter.
I don't think so.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.885
Well, it's less of a quarter

10:24.972 --> 10:27.627
more of a good luck piece,
really.

10:27.714 --> 10:28.758
I mean, take a closer look.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.891
Look at the way
the light hits it.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.110
Shines and gleams

10:33.197 --> 10:35.025
like liquid sunshine.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.375
Keep looking at it.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.421
Kind of soothing
the way it shines, isn't it?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.815
You can feel your worries
and responsibilities

10:41.902 --> 10:45.688
just fading away.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.168
You might even want
to close your eyes

10:47.255 --> 10:49.126
and just have a little sleep.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.654
My uncle had
a Buffalo nickel.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.525
He was always gonna sell it
and buy a ranch and all that

10:56.612 --> 10:58.788
but he lost it
in a poker game.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.442
So not yours, huh?

11:00.529 --> 11:03.706
No. Maybe check upstairs.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.665
Will do. Thank you.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.975
I checked up on the girlfriend.
She seems clean.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.977
No priors,
committed pacifist.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.979
People I talked to say
she and Fisher were close.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.024
Alright. Let's keep an eye
on her, though.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.721
Okay.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.680
Hey. I pulled a message
off the victim's cell phone.

11:20.767 --> 11:21.985
Think you wanna hear it.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.639
[man speaking in accent]
'Fisher, you dog!'

11:23.726 --> 11:26.033
'You think you can get away with
this? I find you, Fisher!'

11:26.120 --> 11:27.512
'You're gonna pay
for what you done!'

11:27.599 --> 11:28.775
'You hear me, Fisher? You pay!'

11:28.862 --> 11:30.820
He doesn't sound very happy.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.300
What's the accent?

11:32.387 --> 11:33.997
I sent a copy down to Pete
in Forensics.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.607
He can tell us.
He's a genius with accents.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.870
What time did the call come in?

11:36.957 --> 11:38.698
11:45 last night.

11:38.785 --> 11:42.049
Coroner puts time of death
between 11 and 2. Bingo. Maybe.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.659
I'm working on getting
the subscriber info

11:43.746 --> 11:45.269
for the number from
the phone company right now.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.923
- Good.
- Oh, boss, one more thing.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.359
I've been looking
into Fisher's past

11:48.446 --> 11:49.491
and hit a snag
with the Peace Corps thing.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.101
What kind of snag?

11:51.188 --> 11:52.407
Well, they've got no record

11:52.494 --> 11:53.800
of Fisher being a member

11:53.887 --> 11:54.931
'going back ten years.'

11:55.018 --> 11:56.454
'I'm having them check to see'

11:56.541 --> 11:58.152
if it could be a clerical error
or spelling mistake.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.371
Talk to the girlfriend.
Find out where he was stationed.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.633
Alright.

12:03.592 --> 12:07.030
Are you taking a vacation
from this case or what?

12:07.117 --> 12:08.597
Huh? No.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.294
Boss, I put the license

12:10.381 --> 12:12.470
of the car that you thought was
following us in the system.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.255
It was rented from the airport
three days ago.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.431
'Corporate account to some
shell company I couldn't track.'

12:16.518 --> 12:17.693
I just got a fresh hit.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.303
The car was ticketed
a half hour ago

12:19.390 --> 12:20.740
just two blocks away
from the victim's repair shop.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.567
Nice. Let's go.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.788
You coming or what?

12:25.875 --> 12:28.356
- Are those bulletproof vests?
- Yeah.

12:28.443 --> 12:31.141
Uh, think not.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.100
- Good luck.
- Okay.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.739
[whispers]
No light.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.459
[whispers]
Locked.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.599
[indistinct chatter]

13:49.567 --> 13:50.742
Freeze!
Drop your weapons!

13:50.830 --> 13:53.180
Put your hands on your heads!

13:56.661 --> 13:57.837
Hello.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.682
Okay.

14:17.769 --> 14:21.121
So yesterday
you were bumming change.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.732
Here you are today
with a $1000 handgun

14:23.819 --> 14:25.690
'nicely maintained.'

14:25.777 --> 14:27.649
'You can understand
our puzzlement.'

14:30.565 --> 14:33.220
Sir, my name is Cole Ruger.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.657
I have a license for that
and a carry permit.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.661
Okay, Mr. Ruger,
what do you know

14:39.748 --> 14:41.141
about the death of Ted Fisher?

14:41.228 --> 14:42.620
Nothing.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.275
Fisher was a buddy of mine.
That's all.

14:45.362 --> 14:46.973
You and he were
in the Peace Corps together?

14:47.060 --> 14:49.627
Hmm. No.

14:49.714 --> 14:52.369
We worked
at Sagaris together.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.632
What is Sagaris?

14:54.719 --> 14:56.634
A security firm.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.114
We provide services

14:58.201 --> 15:00.595
the regular army
isn't equipped for.

15:02.379 --> 15:05.034
Wait. You and Fisher
were mercenaries?

15:05.121 --> 15:08.298
Private security contractors.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.561
Where did you do
most of your contracting?

15:10.648 --> 15:13.695
All over. Mostly Iraq.
Fallujah, Basra.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.525
Where were you
when Fisher was killed?

15:17.612 --> 15:20.571
Ted called me two days ago
and said he was in trouble.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.182
He needed help.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.488
Whatever it was, he couldn't say
it over the phone.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.056
And you just dropped everything,
no questions asked, headed here?

15:27.143 --> 15:30.320
That's right.
Wouldn't you?

15:30.407 --> 15:32.888
Where were you coming from?

15:32.975 --> 15:34.629
I was overseas.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.197
What did Fisher tell you
when you got here?

15:37.284 --> 15:39.590
Nothing.

15:39.677 --> 15:42.419
He was already dead.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.508
I was too late.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.293
At which point you disguised
yourself as a homeless man

15:46.380 --> 15:48.077
to get close
to the crime scene.

15:48.164 --> 15:51.776
I was trying to gather intel,
figure out who killed Ted.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.214
Which is why you broke into
his store with a loaded handgun?

15:54.301 --> 15:56.303
'I was staking out the place.
I heard a noise inside.'

15:56.390 --> 15:58.914
The back door was open.
I went in.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.395
I encountered that woman.
She was armed.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.397
So I drew my weapon. Like I
said, it's fully licensed

16:03.484 --> 16:05.877
and I have a carry permit.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.316
Look..

16:09.403 --> 16:12.536
...agent,
I wanna work with you guys

16:12.623 --> 16:14.538
to find out who killed Ted.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.540
Whatever I can do. So as soon
as you cut me loose--

16:16.627 --> 16:17.933
Cut you loose?

16:18.020 --> 16:20.370
Sure.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.330
I haven't committed a crime.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.288
Or should I call my attorney?

16:30.859 --> 16:33.470
Okay. Obviously, you're
not the victim's neighbor

16:33.557 --> 16:35.516
and I need you
to explain this.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.346
My name is Vivian Griswold.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.001
I had nothing to do with
the murder of Ted Fisher.

16:42.088 --> 16:45.569
A client hired me six months ago
to observe Mr. Fisher.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.833
What kind of client?
What exactly do you do?

16:48.920 --> 16:52.054
I work for a company
providing corporate intelligence

16:52.141 --> 16:53.795
and covert surveillance.

16:53.882 --> 16:57.059
A private sector spy.
Who's the client?

16:57.146 --> 17:00.454
Mm. Tsk.
Can't tell you that.

17:00.541 --> 17:04.023
What I cantell you is that
it involved a major theft

17:04.110 --> 17:08.288
from my clients, overseas,
two years ago.

17:08.375 --> 17:11.595
- And Fisher was connected how?
- He was a person of interest.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.119
Mr. Fisher left his job

17:13.206 --> 17:15.425
shortly after an investigation
was launched.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.124
His reasons for leaving
were questionable.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.648
You said you had Fisher
under surveillance.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.129
So where were you
the night of his death?

17:23.216 --> 17:24.956
I had information
that led me to believe

17:25.044 --> 17:28.221
that Mr. Fisher would be
at a different location.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.919
Obviously,
that was bad information.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.877
I guess.

17:32.964 --> 17:36.751
So how did you come to be
in Fisher's locked shop

17:36.838 --> 17:38.535
carrying a weapon?

17:38.622 --> 17:41.582
I was surveilling the shop
when I heard a noise inside.

17:41.669 --> 17:44.063
The back door was open,
and I went in.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.065
Finding an armed man inside

17:46.152 --> 17:49.677
I drew my fully licensed
and permitted weapon.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.548
That's all.

17:51.635 --> 17:55.248
Now...my lawyer is already
on the way over

17:55.335 --> 17:58.816
but wouldn't we all rather
skip the formalities?

18:04.126 --> 18:06.302
You getting anything?

18:06.389 --> 18:09.131
Well, they're
both professional liars.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.220
Beyond that,
I can't read either of them.

18:11.307 --> 18:12.700
They're both good
for the murder

18:12.787 --> 18:14.963
so each gives the other
reasonable doubt.

18:15.050 --> 18:18.184
We need to come at this
from another angle.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.794
Just got off the phone
with Pete in Forensics.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.839
He says the accent's Iraqi,
probably from Baghdad.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.493
Any luck tracking down
the caller?

18:23.580 --> 18:25.626
Prepaid cell phone.
No subscriber info.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.280
I tried calling it,
but the minutes must be up.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.498
Great.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.722
Agent Lisbon.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.420
I just got a call from the state
department about your case.

18:37.507 --> 18:38.856
What should I know?

18:38.943 --> 18:40.597
The state department?
What'd they say?

18:40.684 --> 18:43.426
Our victim, Fisher, was
suspected of getting too close

18:43.513 --> 18:46.168
to shady Iraqi businessmen.

18:46.255 --> 18:48.039
A theft may have occurred.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.041
Nothing could ever be proven.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.479
They would like to be
kept abreast of developments.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.437
We've got a threatening call
from somebody

18:54.524 --> 18:57.005
who may or may not be Iraqi
and two suspects in holding

18:57.092 --> 19:00.051
'who've got experience
with counterintelligence.'

19:00.139 --> 19:01.401
And you have strong leads?

19:01.488 --> 19:02.924
Something for me
to tell Washington?

19:03.011 --> 19:04.882
Nothing concrete, sir.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.580
Early indicators say
that it's revenge

19:06.667 --> 19:08.451
for whatever happened
in Iraq.

19:08.538 --> 19:09.887
Hmm.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.454
What about you, Mr. Jane?

19:11.541 --> 19:14.979
What dazzling insights
have you gleaned?

19:15.066 --> 19:16.329
Uh, I've got nothing.

19:16.416 --> 19:19.070
Hmm. That's disappointing.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.985
- Off your game somehow?
- Mm.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.944
- Distracted?
- No, not at all.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.685
Sorry to interrupt, boss,
but I just talked

19:24.772 --> 19:26.643
to the girlfriend, Heather Blue.
She's frightened.

19:26.730 --> 19:27.905
'Says someone is prowling
around her apartment.'

19:27.992 --> 19:29.603
Let's go and see her.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.126
I wanna ask her about
that Peace Corps thing anyway.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.301
Jane, are you co..

19:32.388 --> 19:33.694
[whispers]
Damn.

19:33.781 --> 19:36.392
- Problem?
- Not at all, sir.

19:36.479 --> 19:38.351
- Keep me informed.
- Okay.

19:38.438 --> 19:41.005
These people
are lying to you.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.486
Teddy was in the Peace Corps.
I told you that.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.053
We checked.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.011
Ted Fisher worked
for Sagaris Private Defense

19:47.098 --> 19:51.146
from 2000 to 2009 since he first
got out of the army.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.321
He was a mercenary.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.323
No. He wasn't.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.238
Not possible.

19:56.325 --> 19:59.110
Heather, you called us here
because somebody frightened you.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.418
[inhales deeply]
Oh, well, uh..

20:02.505 --> 20:05.726
...yeah, I was watching TV
when I heard the noise.

20:05.813 --> 20:06.944
He was trying
to come in the back

20:07.031 --> 20:08.381
but when I yelled, he ran.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.165
Did you get a look at him?

20:10.252 --> 20:11.732
No, I just saw the glint
of the knife

20:11.819 --> 20:13.516
he was using
to cut the screen.

20:13.603 --> 20:16.998
You can't remember anything else
about him? Size? Hair color?

20:17.085 --> 20:19.914
Um, uh, he was wearing
a hooded sweatshirt, I think.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.655
A little taller than me,
maybe.

20:21.742 --> 20:24.397
Are you sure it was male?
Could it have been a woman?

20:24.484 --> 20:27.487
I don't know. Maybe. God, my
heart's going a mile a minute.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.924
We've assigned you
a protection detail.

20:30.011 --> 20:33.275
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

20:33.362 --> 20:36.931
You really want me
to believe Ted lied to me?

20:37.018 --> 20:39.977
The whole time,
he was lying to me?

20:40.064 --> 20:41.457
I'm sorry.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.420
[whistling]

20:52.686 --> 20:54.731
O'Donnell. How goes it?

20:54.818 --> 20:56.777
Fine. As long
as they keep bringing food

20:56.864 --> 20:58.561
every couple hours,I'm good.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.955
Yeah. Well,
I brought you a chair.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.523
Just opens up, and..

21:03.610 --> 21:04.959
- There.
- Great.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.483
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.572
Just glad to know we got
a good man like you on the job.

21:09.659 --> 21:10.965
Just...and ease your way
into it.

21:11.052 --> 21:13.315
That's it.
Just ease your way down.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.099
- Okay. There we go. Got it?
- Yeah.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.972
Okay, fantastic. Um,
I'll check on you later on.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.234
Okay.

21:20.931 --> 21:21.889
Thanks.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.203
Whoever was trying
to get into the apartment

21:32.291 --> 21:34.031
it wasn't Ruger or Griswold.

21:34.118 --> 21:35.859
'They were only released
an hour ago.'

21:35.946 --> 21:37.948
Well, maybe they have
someone else working with them

21:38.035 --> 21:41.430
orthe girlfriend is
having some very bad dreams.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.214
Okay.
Do you have any intention

21:43.302 --> 21:47.218
of actually taking part
in this case?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.612
It's all under control.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.789
Wait.
You know who the killer is?

21:52.876 --> 21:54.182
The what?

21:54.269 --> 21:56.532
Oh, the killer.
No. No, I misspoke.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.186
What's going on with you?

21:58.273 --> 22:00.362
You've been acting strange
since this case started.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.451
Strange.
Strange, how?

22:02.538 --> 22:04.235
Strange like..
Whee!

22:04.323 --> 22:06.020
Or..

22:06.107 --> 22:08.239
Boss, Rigsby's..

22:08.327 --> 22:09.458
...got somethin'.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.158
Oh!

22:14.245 --> 22:15.682
Just got a call
from the guys in evidence.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.031
Fischer's phone was ringing.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.511
It's been going off
every half hour.

22:18.598 --> 22:19.599
And where did the call
come from?

22:19.686 --> 22:21.296
Same number.
Prepaid cell phone.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.950
I thought you said
the cell phone angle was dead.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.299
[Cho]
'He must have put
more minutes on it.'

22:24.386 --> 22:26.083
[phone ringing]

22:29.304 --> 22:31.132
This is Cho.
Yeah, we're all set here.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.742
'How are you guys coming along?'

22:32.829 --> 22:34.483
Cho's talking to the phone
company so that when the call

22:34.570 --> 22:36.267
'comes through, we can
triangulate off the cell towers'

22:36.355 --> 22:38.661
'figure out exactly
where the call came from.'

22:38.748 --> 22:41.882
[cell phone ringing]
I need you to keep him on the
phone for at least two minutes.

22:41.969 --> 22:46.277
[clears throat]
Hi, this is Patrick Jane.
Listen, I know who you are.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.497
[man on phone]
'Shut up!
I am coming to get you.'

22:48.584 --> 22:51.370
'I don't know who you are but
I will make you pay for this.'

22:51.457 --> 22:53.546
[Jane]
'No, you shut up. You listen
to me. I know what you want.'

22:53.633 --> 22:55.548
The only way you're gonna get it
is if you meet me in person.

22:55.635 --> 22:56.853
We got something to settle here.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.594
'Outside the repair shop
in one hour.'

22:58.681 --> 23:00.030
'You be there,
you get what you want.'

23:00.117 --> 23:01.467
If you don't,
you'll never see it again.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.164
Simple as that.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.296
- Wh..
- What was that?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.473
I said two minutes.
That was hardly 30 seconds.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.083
Well, I just thought it'd be
simpler to bring him to us.

23:10.737 --> 23:11.999
It's okay.
Thank me later.

23:12.086 --> 23:13.957
Now the strangeness
we were talking about..

23:14.044 --> 23:15.742
- Never mind.
- Okay.

23:17.308 --> 23:19.180
[bell clanking]

23:19.267 --> 23:20.747
[train chugging]

23:22.923 --> 23:25.316
[dramatic music]

23:44.858 --> 23:46.207
Hello. Oh, hey!

23:46.294 --> 23:47.991
[train chugging]

23:56.826 --> 23:58.654
[grunting]

23:58.741 --> 24:00.003
Hey!

24:00.090 --> 24:01.657
No!

24:01.744 --> 24:03.398
Hey, don't..

24:03.485 --> 24:05.531
Where is that bastard, Fischer?

24:05.618 --> 24:07.228
No!

24:07.315 --> 24:10.492
Let me go.
Where is that bastard, Fischer?

24:10.579 --> 24:12.494
'Who are you?'

24:12.581 --> 24:14.148
Come on.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.681
My name is Omar Hassan.

24:25.768 --> 24:27.291
Okay.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.467
Why were you so angry
with Ted Fischer?

24:30.077 --> 24:32.601
My father worked
for the Americans.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.691
Helping to establish
a free and democratic Iraq.

24:35.778 --> 24:36.910
He and Fischer worked together?

24:38.215 --> 24:39.521
Yes.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.001
Before my father was killed.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.306
How did he die?

24:44.134 --> 24:46.615
Bomb, two years ago.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.138
Fischer was involved
in his death?

24:48.225 --> 24:51.011
No, but when it became clear

24:51.098 --> 24:53.666
that my father's life
was in danger

24:53.753 --> 24:56.016
Fischer promised he would
take care of my family

24:56.103 --> 24:58.322
if anything happened
to my father.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.585
And Fischer told you this?

25:00.977 --> 25:02.979
After my father was killed..

25:03.066 --> 25:05.025
...Fischer quit his job.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.506
He, he wanted no more
of killing.

25:09.159 --> 25:12.423
He promised to help
get us to America

25:12.511 --> 25:14.382
and that the two million dollars

25:14.469 --> 25:16.427
'will be waiting for us
when we arrived.'

25:16.515 --> 25:18.212
That's a lot of money.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.866
The state department thinks
Fischer was engaged

25:19.953 --> 25:21.215
in criminal activity in Iraq.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.390
Is that where
the money came from?

25:23.609 --> 25:25.828
No, it came from my father.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.308
It was our family fortune.

25:27.395 --> 25:28.918
Your father put
a lot of trust in Fischer.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.356
He believed
he was a good man.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.535
He stayed under our roof.

25:36.622 --> 25:39.581
He-he broke bread with us.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.496
So Fischer helped
to get the visas necessary

25:41.583 --> 25:43.324
to come to America..

25:43.411 --> 25:46.370
...and your family arrived
four days ago. Is that correct?

25:46.457 --> 25:48.634
And what happened
when you met up with Fischer?

25:48.721 --> 25:51.158
We were supposed to meet
two nights ago

25:51.245 --> 25:52.638
but he never showed up.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.291
You thought
he double-crossed you?

25:54.378 --> 25:57.556
That he stole the money, and
that's why you cut the screen

25:57.643 --> 25:59.122
and tried to break
into the apartment?

26:01.037 --> 26:02.299
Yes.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.955
What about Fischer's friend,
Cole Ruger?

26:08.349 --> 26:11.047
Did you ever meet him or did
Fischer ever talk about him?

26:11.134 --> 26:12.788
No, I-I don't know him.

26:17.445 --> 26:18.838
What am I to tell my mother?

26:20.709 --> 26:21.841
My sisters?

26:23.712 --> 26:26.019
I mean,
we have nothing now.

26:28.195 --> 26:30.023
Yeah, it's a tough break.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.244
I'll be right back.

26:36.072 --> 26:37.552
The kid doesn't seem
like a killer.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.554
I'm not sure
the revenge motive works.

26:39.641 --> 26:40.816
Mm.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.296
What are you doing?

26:42.383 --> 26:43.732
- What is that?
- None of your business.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.516
- Are you even listening to me?
- Every word.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.041
- Let's go catch this killer.
- How are we gonna do that?

26:48.128 --> 26:49.738
The killer was looking
for the Hassan family's

26:49.825 --> 26:51.435
two million dollars,
the rest is easy.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.530
And now you want me to ask you
what the plan

26:59.618 --> 27:00.793
you worked out is,
don't you?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.664
No, I just want you
to round everyone up.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.666
- Get 'em to the repair shop.
- Everyone? Who's everyone?

27:04.753 --> 27:06.494
Uh, well, let me see.
There's the girlfriend.

27:06.581 --> 27:09.236
And Omar there.
And, uh, Griswold and Ruger.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.542
- I think that about covers it.
- Ruger and Griswold?

27:11.630 --> 27:14.023
They've already been released,
and from what I've seen of them

27:14.110 --> 27:15.895
we're not really equipped
to track 'em down.

27:15.982 --> 27:18.071
- Oh, no. It's gonna be easy.
- Easy?

27:18.158 --> 27:19.638
Ruger bought a plane ticket
out of the country

27:19.725 --> 27:21.509
the second he left the CBI.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.642
Griswold disappeared even
after we put a tail on her.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.470
Ruger is not leaving
the country.

27:26.557 --> 27:28.472
He is after the money.
You heard Omar.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.605
He'd never even heard
of Ruger.

27:30.692 --> 27:33.216
Ruger worked with Fischer,
but I bet they weren't friends.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.349
- And Griswold?
- She's after the money too.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.264
I expect they're both trying
to get into the repair shop

27:37.351 --> 27:40.223
as we speak. You just
have to round them up.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.877
- Call me if you need any help.
- Wait a minute.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.271
You're leaving again?
What is going on with you?

27:44.358 --> 27:46.273
When have I ever steered
you wrong before?

27:48.405 --> 27:50.886
I mean, when have I ever
reallysteered you wrong?

27:50.973 --> 27:53.062
Where I've done something
that didn't work out..

27:53.149 --> 27:54.760
- The way we wanted it to?
- Seriously?

27:54.847 --> 27:56.326
Okay, fine.
Let me put it this way.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.633
When have I ever intentionally
screwed things up

27:58.720 --> 28:00.200
so that we couldn't solve
the case?

28:01.984 --> 28:03.507
No. Not that I know of,
at least.

28:03.594 --> 28:05.596
Uh, that's right. Thank you.
Have a little faith, Lisbon.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.868
[Rigsby]
Okay, Jane said
they're here somewhere.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.391
Let's take a look.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.050
Probably not the homeless guy.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.399
No, Ruger tried
that one before.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.274
How about the food guys?

28:31.361 --> 28:32.493
No, too short.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.541
Gotta be the truck.

28:37.628 --> 28:38.847
- That's it.
- Yep.

28:38.934 --> 28:41.720
- Hey, guys, I got this.
- Yes, you do.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.419
[instrumental music]

28:57.126 --> 28:59.520
Hi, Mr., uh..

28:59.607 --> 29:01.304
How you doin'?

29:01.391 --> 29:04.264
What do you want?
I'm not breaking any laws.

29:04.351 --> 29:08.790
[chuckles]
We just wanted to ask you
into the repair shop.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.400
It would be a big help
for us.

29:15.884 --> 29:17.756
Alright. No problem.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.586
[music continues]

29:26.155 --> 29:27.896
One down, one to go.

29:31.204 --> 29:32.292
See anything?

29:32.379 --> 29:33.597
Nope.

29:41.431 --> 29:42.824
[cell phone ringing]

29:44.565 --> 29:46.088
[Jane]
'Cho, how's it going?'

29:46.175 --> 29:47.481
[Cho]
'We found Ruger
in a delivery van'

29:47.568 --> 29:48.743
'but Griswold's
nowhere in sight.'

29:48.830 --> 29:50.005
Are you near the repair shop?

29:50.092 --> 29:51.398
Yeah, right out front.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.269
Okay, from where you stand

29:53.356 --> 29:55.924
what is the best vantage point
to see the shop?

29:56.011 --> 29:57.578
He wants us to look
for the best observation post

29:57.665 --> 29:58.971
'for watching the shop.'

30:03.802 --> 30:05.934
How about way over there?
That building across the street?

30:06.021 --> 30:07.718
There's a building across
the street. Rooftop's good.

30:09.546 --> 30:12.506
[grunts]
Do you have a pen
and some paper?

30:14.073 --> 30:15.944
What's up?
What are you doing?

30:18.904 --> 30:20.557
- Throw me a pen.
- A pen?

30:23.082 --> 30:24.823
Nice catch.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.303
[instrumental music]

30:36.965 --> 30:38.401
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.234
[music continues]

31:01.207 --> 31:02.208
[yawning]

31:02.295 --> 31:04.384
Hey, O'Donnell,
snack break.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.603
- Oh, thanks, buddy.
- No problem.

31:06.690 --> 31:07.866
It's about time.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.478
- Mmm.
- Turkey.

31:13.654 --> 31:16.048
[instrumental music]

31:22.750 --> 31:23.969
[fizz]
Ow!

31:26.797 --> 31:27.886
Crap!

31:30.758 --> 31:33.152
[dramatic music]

31:46.339 --> 31:48.863
Look, you gotta put this on.
We don't have a lot of time.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.911
You're gonna use this
to get out through the door.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.789
Wait, what are you
talking about?

32:01.876 --> 32:03.312
Well, you asked me to get
you out of here, that's what

32:03.399 --> 32:05.097
I'm doing. Helping you escape.
Now hurry up.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.055
Escape? I'm not escaping,
you think I wanna spend

32:07.142 --> 32:08.578
the rest of my life on the run?

32:08.665 --> 32:11.930
No. You get the charges dropped.
That's the deal.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.409
Hey, whoa, whoa.
I'm not a lawyer.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.324
I can't make charges
just disappear.

32:15.411 --> 32:17.370
But I can get you to Mexico.

32:17.457 --> 32:18.849
[whispering]
Set you up with
a little starter money.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.417
Mexico? Who the hell
wants to go to Mexico?

32:21.504 --> 32:23.158
- What?
- You get me out free and legal.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.551
Or I start talking.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.031
I'm pretty sure
the dirt I got on you

32:26.118 --> 32:27.771
will be worth
a get-out-of-jail free card.

32:29.382 --> 32:30.557
You're very annoying.

32:32.211 --> 32:33.516
And you're running
out of time.

32:35.214 --> 32:37.607
[instrumental music]

32:43.570 --> 32:45.702
Are they the ones?

32:45.789 --> 32:48.270
Are you going to arrest them?

32:48.357 --> 32:51.752
Oh, hi. You must be Heather.
Thanks for coming by.

32:51.839 --> 32:53.275
Ted Fischer was a good man

32:53.362 --> 32:55.190
who kept trust
with the Hassan family.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.540
He was murdered
over two million dollars

32:57.627 --> 32:59.803
which is somewhere in this room.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.675
Two million dollars?

33:01.762 --> 33:03.633
Ted didn't have
two million dollars.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.331
Uh, yes, he did.

33:05.418 --> 33:06.636
They could tell you.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.160
How do you know
it's in this room?

33:08.247 --> 33:09.813
Because we've checked
every other location

33:09.900 --> 33:11.990
'connected to Fischer,
and so have you.'

33:12.077 --> 33:13.600
That's why you're here.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.297
Hasn't this room
already been searched..

33:15.384 --> 33:16.951
...both by the killer
and by the police?

33:17.038 --> 33:20.737
Yes, but they, I'm sorry,
weren't creative enough.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.739
It could be in bearer bonds
hidden in the bills

33:22.826 --> 33:24.132
or invoices, or files

33:24.219 --> 33:26.395
or more likely,
in the form of jewels

33:26.482 --> 33:30.356
hidden somewhere
inside these electronics.

33:30.443 --> 33:33.011
Whatever form it's in,
we're gonna find it right now.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.447
Come on in, folks.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.188
'These people
are gonna take everything'

33:36.275 --> 33:39.365
and pull it apart until
they find the hidden treasure.

33:39.452 --> 33:43.151
Yes, piece by piece..

33:43.238 --> 33:45.588
...until we find it.
Thank you, folks.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.068
If everybody could
just step outside

33:47.155 --> 33:49.070
and let these people
do their jobs. Thanks.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.202
Thank you.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.597
[instrumental music]

34:10.874 --> 34:12.485
They didn't find anything.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.617
No cash,
no jewels, no bonds.

34:14.704 --> 34:16.315
- Nothin'.
- Huh.

34:16.402 --> 34:17.620
What am I going to do?

34:19.622 --> 34:21.972
'My family is ruined.'

34:22.060 --> 34:24.018
All my father did
was for nothing.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.287
What a waste of time.

34:32.374 --> 34:34.768
I'd agree with him, except
it's this kind of incompetence

34:34.855 --> 34:37.336
that makes people pay me
to produce results.

34:37.423 --> 34:38.511
Hmm.

34:45.953 --> 34:48.912
These people have
all been lying to you.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.175
I was right about Teddy.

34:51.654 --> 34:52.742
You were wrong.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.571
Aha! I figured it out.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.748
I know exactly
where the fortune is.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.231
[chuckles]

35:10.064 --> 35:11.544
[instrumental music]

35:14.721 --> 35:15.809
Where is it then?

35:17.811 --> 35:19.160
Where's the money?

35:22.642 --> 35:24.078
You're on top of it.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.037
Under the carpet?

35:27.125 --> 35:28.387
No.

35:28.474 --> 35:29.562
It is the carpet.

35:29.649 --> 35:32.391
Touch it.
Pure silk, hand-knotted.

35:34.958 --> 35:37.004
[chuckles]
It looks like
a dirty, old carpet.

35:37.091 --> 35:38.484
Oh, yes, it's very old.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.138
One of the reasons
it's so valuable.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.227
- Wow.
- I gotta phone this in.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.358
Stop.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.318
Let's talk about this.

35:48.581 --> 35:51.018
If you did call it in

35:51.105 --> 35:54.152
the legal mess will take
forever to sort out.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.893
This carpet will just end up in
a government locker somewhere.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.156
Yeah, probably.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.595
What if we just..

36:02.682 --> 36:04.553
...took it?

36:04.640 --> 36:05.728
You and me?

36:09.776 --> 36:12.126
We took the carpet..

36:12.213 --> 36:15.521
...sold it, and divided
the profits between us?

36:17.044 --> 36:18.698
Exactly.

36:18.785 --> 36:20.134
[laughing]

36:23.311 --> 36:24.530
Hmm.

36:24.617 --> 36:25.922
That's, uh..

36:28.751 --> 36:30.144
That's a great idea.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.537
Isn't it?

36:31.624 --> 36:33.191
Fifty-fifty split?

36:33.278 --> 36:34.801
Sure, fifty-fifty.

36:34.888 --> 36:36.106
Deal.

36:38.457 --> 36:39.936
Deal.

36:40.023 --> 36:42.025
What did Ted say when you
suggested that deal to him?

36:43.244 --> 36:46.029
Ted was a soft-headed fool.

36:46.116 --> 36:49.468
Aha! So you knew
about the money.

36:49.555 --> 36:50.947
You knew Ted wasn't
with the Peace Corps.

36:51.034 --> 36:52.775
- You knew everything.
- I didn't..

36:52.862 --> 36:54.951
- I didn't say that.
- Oh, yes, you did.

36:55.038 --> 36:58.346
Which means, Heather,
it was you that shot Ted.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.870
He told you about his identity.
He told you about the money.

37:00.957 --> 37:04.657
- And you shot him for it.
- No, uh, that's-that's...no!

37:04.744 --> 37:08.400
Well, forgive me if I, uh,
I'm not quite convinced.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.576
But I do have to phone this in.
Lisbon will be very happy to--

37:10.663 --> 37:13.143
Stop.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.363
Are you pointing a gun at me,
Heather?

37:15.450 --> 37:18.279
The man I loved
was in the Peace Corps.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.412
He wanted to make the world
a better place.

37:20.499 --> 37:22.762
Ted wasn't who he said he was.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.330
- He was a soldier, a killer.
- So, you shot him?

37:25.417 --> 37:26.331
That's a little
counter-intuitive.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.028
He lied to me.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.335
This had nothing to do
with the two million dollars?

37:30.422 --> 37:32.293
You can't understand,
you can only see things

37:32.380 --> 37:34.513
from your bourgeois
capitalist mindset.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.210
Do you know how much good
could be done

37:36.297 --> 37:37.864
with two million dollars?

37:37.951 --> 37:40.127
How many animals could be saved?

37:40.214 --> 37:42.695
But you couldn't find the money.
The clock was ticking.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.827
You looked everywhere,
and you couldn't find it.

37:44.914 --> 37:47.134
He caught me searching the shop.

37:47.221 --> 37:49.092
He talked to me like
I was some kind of criminal.

37:49.179 --> 37:52.182
Oh, well, pretty much
what you are.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.447
No, I'm blessed
is what I am.

37:55.534 --> 37:59.364
The universe wants me
to have this money.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.931
I'm sorry.
I have to kill you.

38:02.018 --> 38:04.456
But I'm doing it
from a place of love.

38:04.543 --> 38:05.892
Drop the gun.
Put your hands on your head.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.111
[gasps]
Oh, wow.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.029
[whispers]
I'm gonna leave you
with that.

38:17.469 --> 38:19.819
[exhales deeply]

38:19.906 --> 38:21.603
[knock on door]

38:21.690 --> 38:23.562
Hmm.

38:23.649 --> 38:25.694
You were right
about Ruger and Griswold.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.435
He's already disappeared,
and she's admitted

38:27.522 --> 38:29.132
she was working
for the state department

38:29.219 --> 38:32.005
who suspected Fischer
of smuggling and theft.

38:32.092 --> 38:33.223
But they've agreed
to recognize

38:33.311 --> 38:34.877
the Hassan family's
right to the rug

38:34.964 --> 38:36.662
so, everything ends happily.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.664
Mmm. Good.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.319
I waited for you to tell
the Hassans. Come on.

38:41.406 --> 38:45.366
- Oh, no, thanks.
- What do you mean, no, thanks?

38:45.453 --> 38:48.456
Ah! You know, I don't have time
for that kind of treacle.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.240
I have to rearrange
my sock drawer.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.508
I have a serious problem
I have to solve

38:56.595 --> 39:00.773
and I don't have a lot of time
to solve it in.

39:00.860 --> 39:04.777
I knew something
was going on with you.

39:04.864 --> 39:05.952
What is it?

39:09.869 --> 39:13.263
The absolute truth,
or I beat it out of you.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.049
LaRoche has something I need,
so I hired Culpepper

39:16.136 --> 39:17.703
to break into LaRoche's house.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.618
If I can't get
the charges dropped

39:19.705 --> 39:21.402
Culpepper is gonna tell on me.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.624
Oh, my God.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.408
Yeah, it's not good.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.367
What does LaRoche have
that you want?

39:32.979 --> 39:36.504
[whispering]
Hightower didn't murder anybody.
She was framed.

39:36.591 --> 39:40.247
Red John has a friend
inside the CBI.

39:40.334 --> 39:41.944
The Todd Johnson murder.

39:42.031 --> 39:44.251
LaRoche had a short list of
suspects that led to Hightower.

39:44.338 --> 39:46.122
And that's what you were
trying to steal, the list.

39:46.209 --> 39:50.300
Yes, there were four names on
that list besides Hightower's.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.041
One of them is working
for Red John.

39:52.128 --> 39:54.609
- Did you ask LaRoche?
- LaRoche? No.

39:54.696 --> 39:55.958
Because if it's not
one of those names

39:56.045 --> 39:58.178
then LaRoche
is Red John's man.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.963
Why didn't you tell me
about this earlier?

40:01.050 --> 40:02.356
I don't wanna put you
in danger.

40:02.443 --> 40:05.098
You're an idiot.
I will fix this.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.361
But we are gonna have
a serious talk after.

40:07.448 --> 40:09.102
Fix it? I've been trying
to fix it all weekend.

40:09.189 --> 40:11.060
I had the perfect escape
worked out.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.106
And then Culpepper says, "No,
I want the charges dropped."

40:13.193 --> 40:14.586
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

40:22.202 --> 40:23.856
Open it up.

40:23.943 --> 40:25.510
He's in there
with his lawyer.

40:25.597 --> 40:26.511
Perfect.

40:34.736 --> 40:36.303
[Culpepper]
'Lady cop.'

40:36.390 --> 40:39.262
Okay, I can get behind that.

40:39.349 --> 40:41.961
A dumb cop who's pretty
is better than a dumb cop..

40:42.048 --> 40:43.484
[grunts]

40:43.571 --> 40:45.268
What do you think you're doing?
You can't do that.

40:45.355 --> 40:46.618
Oh!

40:46.705 --> 40:48.228
That's a violation
of due process.

40:48.315 --> 40:50.230
You just got this case
dismissed.

40:50.317 --> 40:57.237
[Culpepper grunting]

40:57.324 --> 40:58.630
[elevator bell dings]

41:02.808 --> 41:05.201
[LaRoche]
'What were you thinking,
Agent Lisbon?'

41:05.288 --> 41:07.987
Due to your actions,
a criminal is going free.

41:10.076 --> 41:12.557
I'm sorry, sir.
The frustrations of the job--

41:12.644 --> 41:15.516
Your apologies
are of no import, agent.

41:15.603 --> 41:18.258
Donald Culpepper can no longer
be brought to trial.

41:18.345 --> 41:21.130
Well, hang on. He didn't
actually steal anything, did he?

41:21.217 --> 41:23.306
[sighs]

41:23.393 --> 41:26.571
The one week suspension
is mandatory.

41:26.658 --> 41:29.748
Also, six months
of anger management classes.

41:29.835 --> 41:31.010
Oh!

41:32.925 --> 41:34.013
Yes, sir.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.671
Mmm, I thought that went well.

41:39.758 --> 41:41.760
You're gonna owe me big-time.

41:41.847 --> 41:43.544
Uh, for what exactly?

41:43.631 --> 41:45.851
- Oh, I will--
- Ah, two words.

41:45.938 --> 41:47.330
Anger management.

41:50.116 --> 41:51.291
Hey.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.902
Thank you.

42:04.391 --> 42:06.132
[theme music]
