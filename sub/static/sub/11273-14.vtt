WEBVTT

00:02.520 --> 00:05.637
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:06.187 --> 00:10.738
Woody, let me have
a C.C., rocks...

00:12.186 --> 00:16.782
Something with a twist and whatever
else table ten was drinking.

00:17.186 --> 00:19.620
Boy, your batteries
are running low there, Carla.

00:20.478 --> 00:23.356
I got two sick kids,
kept me up half the night.

00:23.644 --> 00:27.876
The neighbour's dog went into heat
at 5:00 this morning.

00:28.227 --> 00:30.866
And I am in the middle
of a double shift here.

00:31.144 --> 00:33.897
Well, on the bright side,
you look like hell.

00:37.852 --> 00:40.764
Oh, dear. I think this calls
for drastic measures.

00:41.102 --> 00:43.218
- G-6?
- Yeah.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.196
Oh, no. Not G-6.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.683 --> 01:24.278
And leave it off.

02:40.138 --> 02:41.810
Good lord, Sam,

02:42.055 --> 02:45.650
have you been swimming laps
in that cologne of yours?

02:45.971 --> 02:49.441
No, I just dropped the bottle
all over the floor in there.

02:49.804 --> 02:53.479
Another $2.50 down the drain.

02:54.471 --> 02:57.622
Oh, the big bottle.

02:57.971 --> 03:02.920
Hey. Look, The Three Musketeers
is coming on in ten minutes.

03:03.304 --> 03:05.772
- All right.
- Oh, good for you two.

03:06.054 --> 03:07.453
Excellent choice.

03:07.679 --> 03:11.433
Of course, there's no substitution
for the Dumas pÃ¨re novel.

03:11.762 --> 03:14.879
But all in all it wasn't
a bad translation into film.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.155
You better believe it.
I love all that duelling.

03:18.428 --> 03:20.783
Yeah, and the best part
is when Curly

03:21.053 --> 03:24.170
backs into that guard's sword
and makes that "boing" sound.

03:24.886 --> 03:28.845
What makes me think we're
not talking about the same film?

03:29.178 --> 03:32.170
- She probably likes Shemp.
- Right.

03:33.594 --> 03:36.984
Is it possible that occasionally
you people might spend an afternoon

03:37.302 --> 03:41.056
doing something that actually
involves intelligent thought?

03:41.386 --> 03:43.854
- Like what?
- I can't conceive.

03:44.135 --> 03:47.093
And we can all breathe
a sigh of relief for that.

03:52.593 --> 03:56.745
Actually, just observing people
can be very interesting.

03:57.093 --> 04:00.449
Don't you ever make up little stories
about the people you see in the bar?

04:00.760 --> 04:02.557
Nope.

04:02.801 --> 04:06.111
Well, for example,
this couple over here.

04:06.426 --> 04:07.905
What's their story?

04:08.509 --> 04:13.025
That's a guy and a girl
having a drink. Fascinating.

04:13.384 --> 04:17.536
Come on, you can do better than that.
Just use a little imagination.

04:17.884 --> 04:21.240
Okay, that's a guy...

04:21.550 --> 04:24.462
...and a naked girl having a drink.

04:24.759 --> 04:26.192
That's funny, right?

04:26.467 --> 04:28.935
No kidding, fellas.
That was really nifty.

04:29.217 --> 04:30.889
I appreciate you taking me.

04:31.133 --> 04:33.010
Where did they take you, Woody?

04:33.258 --> 04:36.330
Well, we watched the
Greater Boston Women's 1 0K run.

04:36.675 --> 04:37.994
I should've known.

04:38.216 --> 04:40.127
No, now wait a minute.
Hold on there, Diane.

04:40.383 --> 04:41.657
We happen to think it's inspiring

04:41.883 --> 04:43.635
to watch a bunch of women
excel in a sport

04:43.883 --> 04:46.920
from which only until recently
they've been barred from competing.

04:47.258 --> 04:49.692
Well, I'm sorry, Clifford.
I guess I misjudged you.

04:50.424 --> 04:53.860
Besides, there wasn't
a bra on the field.

04:54.174 --> 04:57.689
It was an awfully chilly morning,
if you know what I mean.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.911
More coffee for Chuckles.

05:01.215 --> 05:02.728
Who?

05:02.965 --> 05:05.274
That guy over there.

05:05.632 --> 05:07.224
Haven't you noticed him?

05:07.507 --> 05:09.338
He's been sitting there
for a couple hours

05:09.590 --> 05:13.265
drinking coffee and staring at us.

05:13.632 --> 05:15.270
So, what's the problem?

05:15.548 --> 05:18.460
I'll tell you what's the problem.
He doesn't smile. He doesn't talk.

05:18.756 --> 05:20.906
He looks at me like I'm not there.

05:21.173 --> 05:23.733
You'd think I'd slept with him
or something.

05:26.048 --> 05:28.084
So what?
He's not bothering anyone.

05:28.381 --> 05:29.860
He's bothering me.

05:30.089 --> 05:32.603
He gives me the creeps.

05:33.339 --> 05:35.330
Look. See that?
He's writing something down.

05:35.589 --> 05:37.420
- Now, what do you think he's up to?
- Come on.

05:37.672 --> 05:39.628
For all we know,
he's writing down a shopping list.

05:39.922 --> 05:43.358
Well, here's the perfect chance
for us to play our little game.

05:43.672 --> 05:45.663
Oh, yeah? What game's that?

05:45.922 --> 05:50.791
Well, we were just fantasizing
about customers in the bar,

05:51.963 --> 05:54.841
making up little stories about them.
Two beers, Woody.

05:55.171 --> 05:58.288
Well, he's probably a writer
or a poet or something.

05:58.630 --> 05:59.983
Oh, that's very good.

06:00.255 --> 06:02.564
What do you think
he's writing, Woody?

06:02.838 --> 06:05.272
Well, I hope he's not writing
about a boy and his dog

06:05.546 --> 06:09.698
who roam through the countryside
doing good deeds and drinking beer.

06:11.296 --> 06:12.570
Why?

06:12.837 --> 06:14.748
Because that's the story I'm writing.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.331
He's still looking at us.

06:22.129 --> 06:24.689
So, what's the big deal? As long
as he's minding his own business.

06:24.962 --> 06:28.272
That's just it, Sam.
He's not minding his own business.

06:28.587 --> 06:31.659
It's like he's spying on us.

06:33.711 --> 06:35.861
See that? He just wrote
something else down.

06:36.170 --> 06:38.081
There's an easy way
to figure out what he's up to.

06:38.336 --> 06:40.770
- Somebody just go ask him.
- Oh, let me.

06:41.044 --> 06:42.762
All right.

06:43.003 --> 06:46.439
I'm from the Midwest, and we have
kind of a down-home charm

06:46.753 --> 06:50.189
that makes people
kind of open up to us.

06:54.002 --> 06:57.756
Howdy. I'm Woody Boyd
from Hanover, lndiana.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.395
That's the place mat capitol
of the world.

07:02.335 --> 07:05.008
My mother's name's Margaret
and my father's name's Edgel.

07:05.335 --> 07:07.724
My favourite colour is blue
and I've saved all my baby teeth.

07:08.002 --> 07:09.993
How about you?

07:10.668 --> 07:13.023
Go away.

07:18.668 --> 07:20.226
What'd you find out?

07:21.709 --> 07:24.746
I've lived kind of a dull life.

07:35.292 --> 07:37.852
Look, what's he doing now?

07:38.167 --> 07:40.397
I'd say he's fixing a cigarette lighter
of some sort.

07:40.667 --> 07:44.023
Yeah. Yeah. Perhaps
to the terminally naive.

07:45.042 --> 07:46.714
Those of us in the know can spot

07:46.958 --> 07:50.553
a highly sensitive
Rolleiflex espionage camera.

07:50.916 --> 07:54.113
Yep. Yeah, look, he's taking pictures
of us right now.

07:54.416 --> 07:55.485
Oh, come on, man.

07:55.708 --> 07:58.017
Just because he looks
like a spy and acts like a spy,

07:58.291 --> 08:00.407
it doesn't mean he is a spy, does it?

08:00.708 --> 08:03.176
I think it pretty much does, Sam.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.307
Well, it certainly isn't unheard of

08:05.541 --> 08:08.692
for an individual to come
under some sort of surveillance.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.398
As soon as you get into a computer

08:10.624 --> 08:12.342
hundreds of organizations
have information

08:12.582 --> 08:14.971
about every aspect
of your personal life.

08:15.249 --> 08:17.126
- Wow, really?
- Yes.

08:17.374 --> 08:21.003
In fact, you could be bugged
right now.

08:21.332 --> 08:24.847
Well, now that you mention it,
I am a little ticked, but I guess...

08:30.831 --> 08:32.822
You don't suppose
this guy's with, like, the ClA

08:33.081 --> 08:35.390
- or FBl or anything, do you?
- Could be.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.222
Or he may be...

08:37.456 --> 08:39.128
All right, I'll say it.

08:39.373 --> 08:42.409
He may be with the KGB.

08:42.748 --> 08:44.704
Come to think of it,
this guy does kind of have

08:44.956 --> 08:46.753
a detective look about him.

08:46.997 --> 08:49.272
All right, let's go over the four things
we know about him:

08:49.539 --> 08:51.211
He's been here since we opened,

08:51.455 --> 08:55.414
he's not drinking,
he's not waiting for a table upstairs.

08:55.747 --> 08:58.261
Actually, that's only three.
Anybody else know anything?

08:58.580 --> 09:00.730
You're an idiot.

09:01.038 --> 09:02.915
That would be four then.

09:03.705 --> 09:06.856
You know, if he's a detective,
he's obviously after one of us.

09:07.163 --> 09:09.802
If it was anyone else, he would've
followed them right out the door.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.150
We're the only ones who have
been here the whole time he has.

09:12.455 --> 09:14.013
Look, I got an idea.

09:14.246 --> 09:16.601
I'm gonna go call him
on the phone and distract him.

09:16.871 --> 09:20.261
Cliff, you go see what he's been
writing about us, and don't get caught.

09:20.621 --> 09:22.100
Oh, no, don't worry about that.

09:22.371 --> 09:24.362
Even if he does,
he won't get anything out of me.

09:24.662 --> 09:26.653
You don't know anything.

09:33.620 --> 09:35.133
Cheers.

09:36.787 --> 09:39.620
Yeah, who may--?
Who may I say is calling?

09:42.412 --> 09:46.200
Excuse me, sir, phone for you.

09:46.536 --> 09:49.050
- Who is it?
- They didn't say.

09:49.828 --> 09:51.978
Take a number.

09:53.161 --> 09:55.277
Five.

09:58.328 --> 10:01.365
Oh, they hung up. Probably call back.

10:02.911 --> 10:04.629
Man.

10:05.952 --> 10:08.147
He didn't even take a phone call.
This is getting weird.

10:08.452 --> 10:11.330
All right. Look, we gotta go to
some private place and have a huddle.

10:11.660 --> 10:13.730
All right, how about my office.

10:14.035 --> 10:16.503
Sam, aren't you forgetting
about your cologne?

10:16.785 --> 10:20.744
Come on, would you?
It's had all day to wear off.

10:23.202 --> 10:26.160
Okay. We'll give it
a few more minutes.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.806
The ladies' room. He's never
gonna walk in on us there.

10:29.118 --> 10:31.837
Don't you think that'll look
a little weird?

10:32.118 --> 10:36.077
Well, not if we go in one at a time
so he doesn't notice.

10:36.409 --> 10:39.685
Woody, cover the bar.

10:55.158 --> 10:59.117
I think we could've spaced it out
a little better.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.437
Okay, if anybody here

11:02.700 --> 11:04.895
knows any reason
why their personal conduct

11:05.158 --> 11:07.718
should be coming
under investigation,

11:07.991 --> 11:11.586
I hope they have enough hormones
to step forward and say so.

11:21.574 --> 11:22.893
Okay.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.993
Okay.

11:25.241 --> 11:27.391
I'll bet it's Woody.

11:28.407 --> 11:30.398
Come on, man. That's crazy.

11:30.699 --> 11:31.768
Why, Sam?

11:31.990 --> 11:36.188
The fact that he's not here to defend
himself makes him the perfect choice.

11:36.573 --> 11:39.292
Well, yeah, there's that.

11:39.573 --> 11:40.847
But, also...

11:41.073 --> 11:42.665
Well, what do we know
about Woody, huh?

11:42.906 --> 11:45.022
I mean, he comes in here
off the street out of nowhere.

11:45.281 --> 11:48.751
Sam gives him a job.
No rÃ©sumÃ©, no nothing, huh?

11:49.614 --> 11:51.730
For all we know, he could be
in cahoots with that guy.

11:51.989 --> 11:54.105
I say Woody's a plant.

11:54.739 --> 11:57.651
Only from the neck up.

11:58.406 --> 12:00.397
Come on, Cliff.

12:00.656 --> 12:03.568
Think about it. Woody? I mean,
you're a little off base here, pal.

12:03.864 --> 12:05.058
- Oh, am l?
- Yeah.

12:05.280 --> 12:09.990
Well, he just might've infiltrated
the bar to keep tabs on you, Norm.

12:11.405 --> 12:13.839
Me? What for?

12:14.155 --> 12:16.191
Oh, he's just saying you
hypothetically.

12:16.447 --> 12:19.280
- Well.
- Not really.

12:20.988 --> 12:22.546
What's that supposed
to mean, Cliff?

12:22.780 --> 12:24.896
Think I'm some sort of
crooked accountant, is that it?

12:25.155 --> 12:27.589
No, no, no, Norm. I'm just...

12:27.863 --> 12:30.377
...postulating the possibility there
that the lRS

12:30.654 --> 12:32.849
might think your accounting's
a little creative.

12:33.154 --> 12:34.985
Oh, yeah? Creative, huh?

12:35.237 --> 12:37.228
I say the guy might be
a postal investigator, Cliff.

12:37.487 --> 12:40.638
You haven't bought a stamp
since the Johnson administration.

12:40.946 --> 12:43.506
And I'm talking about Andrew, pal.
Andrew Johnson.

12:43.779 --> 12:47.328
Take that back right now.
I've been a postman for 1 1 years.

12:47.654 --> 12:49.963
- Relax. Take it easy.
- Oh, sure, relax.

12:50.278 --> 12:51.916
From
Mr Love-Them-and-Leave-Them here.

12:52.153 --> 12:54.542
For all we know, he's sniffing out
a paternity suit on you.

12:54.820 --> 12:56.139
Oh, come on.

12:56.737 --> 13:00.252
I think we might be getting
a little carried away.

13:00.611 --> 13:04.843
And this from the woman
who toured Europe on her back.

13:10.278 --> 13:11.597
That's it. That's it!

13:11.861 --> 13:14.136
The guy's upsetting my customers
and my business.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.711
I'm gonna go find out
what he's doing.

13:16.986 --> 13:18.135
Sam.

13:18.819 --> 13:19.934
Sam.

13:20.152 --> 13:21.141
Please.

13:21.735 --> 13:23.691
I know. I know.
You guys are trying to talk me out

13:23.944 --> 13:25.536
of making those charitable
contributions,

13:25.777 --> 13:27.415
but somebody's gotta do it.

13:27.985 --> 13:30.374
Hey, buddy...

13:30.652 --> 13:32.688
Listen, what's your story here?

13:32.943 --> 13:35.411
- You come in here and you--
- Sam.

13:35.693 --> 13:37.285
He's a friend of mine.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.794
- You know this guy?
- Yes.

13:42.110 --> 13:44.146
Thank you, lrving.
You may leave now.

13:44.401 --> 13:47.359
- Sure. See you in class.
- Okay.

13:48.609 --> 13:52.318
We went zooey
over a guy named lrving?

13:53.359 --> 13:55.350
He's a member
of my psychology class.

13:55.609 --> 14:00.603
He's assisting me in a little
experiment about paranoia.

14:01.317 --> 14:02.511
What do you mean, "experiment"?

14:02.775 --> 14:06.848
Well, the idea was to introduce
a foreign element into an established,

14:07.192 --> 14:10.184
secure environment in order
to observe the ensuing behaviour.

14:10.483 --> 14:14.840
I, for one, found it extremely
interesting and highly educational.

14:16.275 --> 14:20.234
Didn't all of you find it extremely
interesting and highly educational?

14:20.858 --> 14:22.928
Anybody?

14:24.608 --> 14:26.838
Oh, come on. Don't get mad.

14:27.108 --> 14:28.336
It's silly to get mad.

14:28.941 --> 14:31.739
Diane, we don't get mad.

14:44.774 --> 14:47.004
Pardon me, Diane.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.716
Excuse me, is there anything
on my back, like a "kick me" sign?

14:52.023 --> 14:54.821
- No.
- Thank you.

14:55.773 --> 14:58.924
For several days I've been expecting
the people here to get back at me

14:59.231 --> 15:01.028
for something I did.

15:01.315 --> 15:02.634
I brought a man in...

15:02.856 --> 15:04.494
Wait a minute.
Why are you so curious?

15:04.773 --> 15:09.164
Just do your crossword
and mind your own beeswax.

15:12.981 --> 15:14.016
Oh, hey, Miss Chambers.

15:14.231 --> 15:17.382
I stopped into the bakery on the way
in to work and I got some muffins.

15:17.689 --> 15:19.839
Would you like one?

15:20.105 --> 15:22.903
Oh, here it is. Muffins?

15:23.230 --> 15:25.744
Yeah, blueberry or bran.
Which one do you want?

15:26.022 --> 15:28.616
Which one do you want, Woody?

15:29.688 --> 15:31.918
I'll take the blueberry, I think.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.664
No, no. I'll take the blueberry.

15:34.938 --> 15:36.451
Okay.

15:37.396 --> 15:38.624
Wait.

15:38.855 --> 15:42.734
It's okay with you that I take
the blueberry? Then I want the bran.

15:43.063 --> 15:45.338
Sure, Miss Chambers. Enjoy it.

16:02.645 --> 16:06.843
I just love the feel of warm muffins
in the morning.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.272
You a little nervous or something?

16:09.520 --> 16:12.034
Me, nervous? I'm not nervous.
I'm not a bit nervous.

16:12.353 --> 16:14.503
I'm positively placid.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.522
- Hello, everyone.
- Oh, Frasier.

16:16.770 --> 16:19.204
Thank God you're here.
What took you so long?

16:19.478 --> 16:20.911
I came as soon as I got
your message.

16:21.186 --> 16:25.623
- Well, I called your office hours ago.
- Well, I'd stepped out to Denver.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.055
Well, if I'd known
you were out of town

16:29.311 --> 16:31.063
I would never have expected you
to come here.

16:31.311 --> 16:34.383
Oh, no, no, no. Don't be silly. Listen,
I was fed up with Denver anyway.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.287
Breathtaking mountains,
wide-open spaces,

16:37.560 --> 16:40.711
that hauntingly beautiful woman that
kept coming onto me in the ski lodge.

16:41.019 --> 16:43.738
Oh, good. Well, as long as
you're here, I wanna talk with you.

16:44.018 --> 16:46.407
Woody, there's a little bit
under that chair.

16:48.893 --> 16:51.202
Diane, I've dreamed of this day.

16:51.518 --> 16:53.236
Oh, Frasier.

16:53.476 --> 16:56.070
I hope you didn't misinterpret
my message

16:56.351 --> 16:59.149
as a wish to rekindle our romance.

17:02.643 --> 17:04.440
No, of course not.

17:04.684 --> 17:06.321
This is Tuesday, right?

17:06.559 --> 17:10.871
When I said I dreamed of this day,
I meant I dreamt of Tuesday.

17:12.226 --> 17:15.104
Listen, I am very proud of the fact
that I am completely over you.

17:15.392 --> 17:17.541
Now, what is it?

17:18.767 --> 17:21.724
Well, the other day
I was conducting an experiment

17:22.017 --> 17:24.326
for my Behavioural Sciences
Colloquium.

17:24.599 --> 17:27.955
- I brought a man in.
- Man. What man?

17:28.266 --> 17:30.336
A classmate. Oh, never mind.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.034
The point is that I played
this harmless trick on them,

17:33.308 --> 17:34.866
and now they're going
to get back at me.

17:35.100 --> 17:38.251
At first I approached it
with my usual good humour,

17:38.558 --> 17:42.028
but now I find I'm obsessed.
I need your help.

17:42.391 --> 17:44.666
Well, I think one or two sessions
should clear it up.

17:44.974 --> 17:49.570
Oh, Frasier, I don't want counselling.
I want you to spy on them.

17:51.932 --> 17:57.006
Get close to them. Find out what
heinous revenge they have planned--!

17:58.015 --> 18:00.404
Diane, look at yourself.

18:00.682 --> 18:03.196
No wonder you're such easy fodder
for their little pranks.

18:03.473 --> 18:06.431
Look, the problem is
you take everything so seriously.

18:06.723 --> 18:09.920
Take it from me, who used to do
the same thing, it's not worth it.

18:10.223 --> 18:13.101
I'm much happier now
that I let things bounce off of me.

18:13.390 --> 18:16.939
Now that I'm happy-go-lucky
Frasier Crane.

18:20.181 --> 18:23.571
Frasier, you're right.
I do take things too seriously.

18:23.889 --> 18:26.005
I need to lighten up a little.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.217
Great. Now that we've
taken care of that,

18:28.472 --> 18:31.509
do you think there's any chance
that you'll ever love me again

18:31.805 --> 18:34.319
before I lie mouldering in the grave?

18:34.639 --> 18:38.075
Oh, I'm joking, of course.

18:38.388 --> 18:42.267
It's just another example
of my devil-may-care attitude.

18:43.263 --> 18:46.016
Well, you've been a big help.
Thank you.

18:47.346 --> 18:49.940
Diane, there's somebody
here who wants to talk to you.

18:52.805 --> 18:54.124
- Yes?
- Miss Chambers,

18:54.346 --> 18:58.259
I'm Martin Gallagher, WLBD,
public broadcasting.

18:58.596 --> 19:02.635
One of your professors at the
university sent us some of your poetry.

19:03.012 --> 19:05.048
And we thought you'd make
a wonderful guest

19:05.304 --> 19:08.740
for our program,
Boston's Working Poets.

19:09.054 --> 19:10.123
- Really?
- Yes.

19:10.345 --> 19:12.142
- You want me to appear on television?
- Yes.

19:12.387 --> 19:14.537
- Well, I'm honoured.
- Well, you should be.

19:14.804 --> 19:17.602
- lsn't that great?
- Oh, yes, it's really...

19:19.470 --> 19:21.381
...unbelievable.

19:21.637 --> 19:23.912
Why don't you tell me
a bit more about your show.

19:24.220 --> 19:27.337
Well, the concept is part-time poets

19:27.636 --> 19:30.912
in their working habitat
reading their own verse.

19:32.469 --> 19:34.664
- Won't that be exciting?
- Why, yes.

19:34.928 --> 19:37.567
Little old me on television.
My, my, my.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.473
- Well, when do we get started?
- Well, would right now be all right?

19:41.844 --> 19:44.438
Your Mr. Malone
has kindly offered his poolroom.

19:44.719 --> 19:46.311
Well, wasn't that nice of him?

19:46.552 --> 19:48.383
I guess right now would be perfect,
wouldn't it?

19:48.635 --> 19:50.944
- Well, good.
- Let me show you where to set up.

19:51.260 --> 19:57.608
So nice of you to drop by Cheers
where I serve the public many beers.

19:59.135 --> 20:00.887
This is it.

20:02.052 --> 20:03.201
Are you sure?

20:03.426 --> 20:05.223
I doubt if the collective intelligence
of them

20:05.468 --> 20:07.936
could devise
this complicated a ruse.

20:08.218 --> 20:09.492
I'm absolutely sure.

20:09.718 --> 20:12.790
They expect me to give
a sensitive rendition of my poetry.

20:13.093 --> 20:14.492
And then at some future date

20:14.718 --> 20:18.393
they'll play it back while they swill beer
and throw spitwads at the screen

20:18.717 --> 20:21.356
and make unpleasant animal noises.

20:21.634 --> 20:24.831
Well, I'm not going to fall for it.

20:25.634 --> 20:28.944
- I have a little surprise for them.
- Now, that's the spirit.

20:29.259 --> 20:31.250
Oh, Diane, what a couple
we'd have made.

20:31.509 --> 20:34.148
Two irrepressible zanies.

20:34.425 --> 20:37.497
Wow, Miss Chambers, what kind
of poetry are you gonna recite?

20:37.967 --> 20:39.605
You too, Woody.

20:39.842 --> 20:45.280
Oh, what a tangled web we weave
when first we practice to deceive.

20:45.716 --> 20:48.628
Well, I hate to burst your bubble,
but I've heard that before.

20:52.966 --> 20:55.434
- We're ready for you, Miss Chambers.
- Yes, I'm sure you are.

20:55.716 --> 20:58.947
- And I'm ready for you.
- Good. You just stand over here.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.972
Aren't you going to give me
a clever introduction?

21:02.257 --> 21:03.610
Oh, we'll dub that in later.

21:03.882 --> 21:07.557
- Oh, why didn't I think of that?
- And roll camera.

21:07.882 --> 21:11.431
As soon as you're ready,
Miss Chambers, just begin.

21:12.340 --> 21:15.855
Well, I would like to begin
with one of my favourites,

21:16.173 --> 21:21.850
and I hope you'll like it too.
It's called "Ode to a Cornish Hen."

21:45.505 --> 21:50.340
Sam, if you have an ounce
of humanity, turn that off.

21:58.171 --> 22:01.163
What did you think
you were doing up there?

22:03.088 --> 22:07.320
- I didn't think it was a real show.
- Are you kidding me?

22:07.671 --> 22:10.390
I mean, who would make up
something that boring?

22:12.171 --> 22:13.889
Well, I thought you did.

22:14.171 --> 22:16.526
I thought it was a joke.

22:16.796 --> 22:19.185
I figured that you set it up
to get back at me

22:19.462 --> 22:22.454
because of my psychology
experiment.

22:23.087 --> 22:26.284
What a great joke.
I wish we had thought of that.

22:27.545 --> 22:29.934
I can't think of it now.

22:33.045 --> 22:36.481
I made an absolute ass of myself.

22:36.795 --> 22:40.105
Oh, come on, Diane. Lighten up.
It wasn't that bad. It really wasn't.

22:40.461 --> 22:44.170
Heck, no. I've known chickens
who can't do that as well as you.

22:45.544 --> 22:47.375
Hey, hey, come on.
It's no big deal.

22:47.628 --> 22:49.220
Nobody watches that stuff.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.770
It's not just the show.

22:55.377 --> 22:58.687
After I filmed that thing,
I felt kind of good

22:59.002 --> 23:01.072
thinking that you guys
had gone to all that trouble

23:01.335 --> 23:04.771
to get back at me
like you would with each other.

23:05.627 --> 23:09.540
And I was thinking of myself
as one of the gang,

23:09.877 --> 23:12.835
and now I don't know whether
I'm more disappointed at that

23:13.127 --> 23:14.606
awful display on television

23:14.835 --> 23:17.224
or the fact that you still
think of me as an outsider.

23:17.543 --> 23:19.738
Oh, boy.

23:21.043 --> 23:23.762
I'm sorry if...
I don't know what to say...

23:24.709 --> 23:26.984
Go into my place, lie down.
Take as much time as you want.

23:27.251 --> 23:30.482
- Feel better.
- Thank you, Sam.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.037
I love you guys!
