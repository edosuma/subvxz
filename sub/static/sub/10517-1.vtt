01:37.314 --> 01:40.977
She was the firstEnglishwoman
l had evermet.

01:41.084 --> 01:44.952
And itseemed to me she knew
more about the world than anyone.

01:45.055 --> 01:48.889
But it was a world Siam
was afraid would consume them.

01:50.093 --> 01:54.325
The monsoon winds had whispered
her arrivallike a coming storm.

01:54.397 --> 01:59.767
Some welcomed the rain,
but others feareda raging flood.

02:00.403 --> 02:05.534
Still she came, unaware
of the suspicion thatprecededher.

02:05.609 --> 02:11.013
But it wasn't untilyears later thatlbegan
to appreciate howbrave she was

02:11.114 --> 02:13.776
and howalone she musthave felt.

02:15.352 --> 02:16.819
An Englishwoman.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.582
The firstl'd evermet.

02:35.305 --> 02:38.604
Mother! Come look!
l think they've killed someone!

02:38.708 --> 02:40.767
Louis, do take care by the railing.

02:40.844 --> 02:44.541
Beebe, Moonshee, gather your things.
lt's time we went to shore.

02:44.614 --> 02:48.050
l think we should wait
until someone from the palace arrives.

02:48.151 --> 02:52.451
lf they were coming, they would be here
already. Besides, the ship is leaving.

02:52.556 --> 02:54.615
My point exactly.

02:59.663 --> 03:01.756
Goodbye, Mrs Leonowens.

03:05.969 --> 03:07.027
Louis!

03:11.007 --> 03:12.474
Louis!

03:12.576 --> 03:13.600
Pardon me.

03:14.578 --> 03:16.808
Louis, come along, darling.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.575
- Mother?
- Yes?

03:18.648 --> 03:21.811
Why does this king need you
if nobody here speaks English?

03:21.885 --> 03:26.015
The ways of England are the ways of
the world. lt's a wise man who knows that.

03:30.694 --> 03:34.858
Memsahib, in less than an hour
the Newcastle sails,

03:34.965 --> 03:37.399
not to return for another month.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.459
Tonight we shall all sleep
in our own home, l promise.

03:40.570 --> 03:42.629
Madam. A carriage... where?

03:42.706 --> 03:44.799
A carriage? Wait, wait.

03:44.874 --> 03:48.275
What is it?

03:50.580 --> 03:52.605
Over there. This way, darling.

04:16.139 --> 04:19.336
What do you suppose he's like,
this King Mongkut?

04:19.442 --> 04:23.071
l heard that people used to be
forbidden to even look at his face

04:23.146 --> 04:25.444
and that they revere him as a god.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.745
- You mean like Jesus?
- No, hardly!

04:27.851 --> 04:31.844
l suppose if he wishes his son
to be tutored in the ways ofthe West,

04:31.921 --> 04:34.151
then l should be quite honored.

04:34.257 --> 04:36.953
But why can't he just send him to London?

04:37.060 --> 04:40.086
Then you wouldn't have
the chance to learn Siamese.

05:06.056 --> 05:09.355
Gracious me!
Are we sure this is the right road?

05:11.361 --> 05:13.352
How would we know?

05:13.463 --> 05:18.958
lf you are not the lead elephant,
the scenery never changes!

05:46.930 --> 05:48.989
Mother, look at those statues!

06:39.482 --> 06:41.575
Mem Leonowens, KawRub.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.845
Mrs Leonowens,

06:42.952 --> 06:47.855
His Excellency, Chao Phya Kralahome,
the prime minister of Siam.

06:53.263 --> 06:55.959
Have you any friends in Bangkok, sir?

06:56.900 --> 06:58.993
No. l know no one here.

07:04.307 --> 07:05.706
Sir is married?

07:07.043 --> 07:11.207
A widow. Can you please explain
to me why you call me sir?

07:12.115 --> 07:15.778
Women do not stand
in the presence of His Excellency.

07:21.324 --> 07:24.555
How long are you in possession
of dead husband?

07:26.996 --> 07:28.520
23 months.

07:29.632 --> 07:31.099
How did he die?

07:32.602 --> 07:37.505
Please convey to His Excellency that my
purpose here is as tutor to the king's son

07:37.607 --> 07:40.667
and it is not necessary
to ask personal questions.

07:41.277 --> 07:42.835
Please.

07:46.049 --> 07:49.416
ln Siam, sir, it is custom

07:49.519 --> 07:52.818
to first ask questions of personal nature

07:52.889 --> 07:54.948
to be polite.

07:58.528 --> 08:01.224
Mr Prime Minister, l meant no disrespect.

08:02.265 --> 08:05.530
However, getting here
was something of a challenge.

08:05.635 --> 08:08.263
Sir will be shown to palace quarters.

08:08.338 --> 08:10.363
Mem.

08:10.473 --> 08:13.772
l beg your pardon.
The king promised us a home

08:13.877 --> 08:15.936
outside the palace walls.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.839
lt's what was agreed upon.

08:19.749 --> 08:25.984
ln Siam, sir, you will learn
everything has its own time.

08:33.263 --> 08:36.664
Don't bother unpacking, Moonshee.
lt's only for one night.

08:36.732 --> 08:41.169
lt shall be settled to our satisfaction
or we'll be leaving as soon as possible.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.932
We don't have any money.

08:43.006 --> 08:46.464
That is correct, but l do not need
to be reminded ofthat.

08:51.481 --> 08:54.109
lt sounds like we're living in a beehive.

08:54.183 --> 08:56.276
ln the morning l shall go to the king.

08:56.352 --> 09:00.721
A monarch who fails to keep his word
is uncivilized, unenlightened and ungrateful.

09:00.790 --> 09:06.126
There are principles at stake. Having a proper
British household with some privacy is one.

09:06.195 --> 09:08.789
l don't think Siam
agrees with you, memsahib.

09:08.898 --> 09:11.196
Mother, how can it be a proper household?

09:11.301 --> 09:14.327
You haven't lived in England
since you were little

09:14.404 --> 09:16.497
and l've never been there at all.

09:16.573 --> 09:19.770
lndia is British.
That's what being colonized is about.

09:21.844 --> 09:24.506
Father would have put him right in his place.

09:24.581 --> 09:27.209
l'm very sorry l'm not
the man your father was.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.384
l'm sorry, Louis.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.789
But this is a good opportunity for us.

09:42.031 --> 09:45.831
l should just... try to look at the positive side.

09:46.469 --> 09:48.562
Assuming there is one.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.605
Your father would have.

09:50.740 --> 09:53.971
He was a brave man, wasn't he?

09:55.144 --> 09:57.203
Yes, very.

09:57.947 --> 10:00.006
And most considerate.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.881
Which is more than l can say for this king.

10:02.986 --> 10:05.147
Shall we go find your bed? Come on.

10:24.974 --> 10:28.239
People of Bang Pli,
His Majesty's brother, Prince Chowfa,

10:28.978 --> 10:32.072
has heard your cries forjustice.

10:49.599 --> 10:51.897
Cut them down!

10:57.006 --> 11:01.102
You. What happened here?

11:02.111 --> 11:05.103
Burmese soldiers, Your Highness...

11:06.249 --> 11:10.049
They said ifwe cut them down

11:10.920 --> 11:14.515
they would return.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.925
Unfortunate
your meeting so delayed, sir.

11:23.032 --> 11:26.331
King's obligation reach
into every corner of Siam.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.667
lt has given me the time
to think of many things,

11:29.772 --> 11:32.707
including why you pretended
not to speak English.

11:32.842 --> 11:35.310
l believe it wise to be cautious.

11:35.378 --> 11:39.041
l will assume that our speaking now
is a great step forward.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.379
Best not to assume too much.

11:42.885 --> 11:45.115
When presented to His Majesty,

11:45.188 --> 11:50.125
you and son will remember
to touch forehead to floor.

11:51.094 --> 11:54.791
Although we have become
better acquainted with your customs,

11:54.897 --> 11:57.661
we have certainly not forgotten our own.

11:57.734 --> 11:59.861
Then how will you greet him?

11:59.936 --> 12:01.995
With the utmost respect.

12:16.018 --> 12:19.078
Mother, are those men speaking French?

12:19.155 --> 12:23.421
Yes. Apparently a warship's
run aground where it shouldn't have.

13:02.565 --> 13:07.161
lt appears sir must wait
to meet His Majesty another day.

13:08.604 --> 13:11.402
No, l do not think so. Come along.

13:12.341 --> 13:14.400
Mem Leonowens!

13:15.545 --> 13:16.739
Mem! Wait!

13:16.813 --> 13:18.940
Please!

13:19.348 --> 13:22.943
Your Majesty, l am Anna Leonowens.
l am the school...

13:23.019 --> 13:25.146
Stop!

13:26.222 --> 13:27.746
Who?! Who?!

13:27.824 --> 13:31.783
Your Majesty,
Mem Anna Leonowens and son Louis.

13:34.497 --> 13:38.490
Your Majesty, we have been
kept waiting for nearly three weeks.

13:38.601 --> 13:42.037
l appreciate that you have
issues of great importance,

13:42.104 --> 13:44.368
but l imagine your son's education...

13:44.440 --> 13:45.998
Silence!

13:51.380 --> 13:54.008
Has she no understanding of protocol?

13:54.817 --> 13:57.786
She has been advised.

14:06.796 --> 14:09.458
You... are teacher?

14:09.532 --> 14:11.625
Yes, Your Majesty, l am.

14:28.084 --> 14:32.885
You do not look sufficient of age
for scientific teaching.

14:33.022 --> 14:35.081
How many years have you?

14:37.526 --> 14:41.519
Enough to know that age and wisdom
do not necessarily go hand in hand.

14:41.631 --> 14:46.364
l doubt you would say same
for being bold and English.

14:46.469 --> 14:49.165
They are rather inseparable, l'm afraid.

14:52.541 --> 14:55.567
His Majesty has not dismissed you.
Follow him.

14:57.980 --> 15:01.074
Come along, Louis. Up, up. Quickly!

15:16.365 --> 15:20.131
You articulate logical answer
under pressure, Mem Leonowens.

15:20.202 --> 15:22.500
That is very kind ofyou, Your Majesty.

15:22.605 --> 15:26.371
But irritating superior attitude
king find most unbeautiful.

15:26.475 --> 15:29.933
However, it will serve you well
given decision l now make.

15:30.079 --> 15:32.547
First impressions can often be misleading.

15:32.615 --> 15:35.209
Along with my eldest son,

15:36.185 --> 15:39.313
you shall now teach all my children.

15:39.388 --> 15:40.616
Come.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.295
The royal family.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.430
23 wives,

15:57.540 --> 15:59.770
42 concubines,

15:59.842 --> 16:02.242
58 offspring,

16:02.345 --> 16:04.745
and 10 more on the way.

16:04.814 --> 16:08.978
Each one unique.
Each one my hope for the future.

16:14.357 --> 16:16.416
l understand your surprise.

16:16.525 --> 16:22.760
Not as many as Emperor of China, but
he did not spend half of life in monastery.

16:22.832 --> 16:24.925
King making up for lost time.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.628
Mother, what's a concubine?

16:37.346 --> 16:42.283
Attention, my most blessed
and royal family, we have company.

16:43.219 --> 16:47.485
Two who have sailed from far, far away.

16:49.558 --> 16:53.187
Presenting original pupil and heir apparent.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.355
Prince Chulalongkorn.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.457
This, my son, is your new teacher.

16:59.301 --> 17:01.599
lt is a great honor, Your Highness.

17:02.371 --> 17:06.671
Have l done something to offend you?

17:08.644 --> 17:10.373
Of course not.

17:11.313 --> 17:17.912
Then why do you punish me
with lmperialist schoolteacher?

17:18.020 --> 17:20.284
He doesn't look too happy about it.

17:26.061 --> 17:27.393
Dearest family,

17:27.829 --> 17:30.731
l desire you all,

17:31.734 --> 17:34.396
when of appropriate age,

17:35.137 --> 17:38.595
to be educated in English language,

17:39.041 --> 17:42.670
science, and literature.

17:43.412 --> 17:47.041
This is a necessary
and practical gift l give to you

17:47.149 --> 17:54.555
and you must never forget to honor your
renowned teacher Mem Anna Leonowens.

17:56.892 --> 17:58.860
Hello, Your Highnesses.

17:59.361 --> 18:02.956
l am pleased to meet you.

18:03.866 --> 18:07.825
This is my son, Louis.

18:08.571 --> 18:10.664
Must not forget head wife.

18:10.739 --> 18:12.832
The Lady Thiang.

18:13.876 --> 18:17.334
lt is my pleasure that you help
make her a fine scholar also.

18:17.446 --> 18:19.107
Lady Thiang.

18:19.248 --> 18:21.148
Welcome, mem teacher.

18:22.251 --> 18:23.946
Prince

18:24.053 --> 18:25.145
Thongkon Yai.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.381
Prince Suk Sawat.

18:32.128 --> 18:34.255
Princess Kannika Kaeo.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.564
And Princess Fa-Ying.

18:42.671 --> 18:45.162
l'm not princess. l'm monkey.

18:45.307 --> 18:47.502
My deepest apologies.

18:52.314 --> 18:54.874
l study her in English myself.

18:56.318 --> 18:59.947
Well, Your Majesty,
l am most flattered by your welcome.

19:00.022 --> 19:03.822
And l find the opportunity
to be in a school an exciting one.

19:03.926 --> 19:07.020
Such devotion to progress
is to be commended.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.898
Reform is vital for my country's survival.

19:13.969 --> 19:17.962
As tiny feet change, so too will Siam.

19:18.040 --> 19:21.567
But being in a country
with so many unique customs,

19:21.644 --> 19:26.843
if l am to raise my son to be like his father,
which l very much hope he will be,

19:26.949 --> 19:30.407
then l must feel free
to follow our own traditions.

19:30.519 --> 19:33.420
As a father, l understand.

19:33.522 --> 19:38.323
Good. Then His Majesty will appreciate why
having a home outside the palace walls

19:38.394 --> 19:40.726
is of such great importance to us.

19:40.796 --> 19:45.529
A home which had been promised
but so far has not been provided.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.168
lt is my pleasure that you live in the palace.

19:54.243 --> 19:56.734
But it is not mine, Your Majesty.

20:01.350 --> 20:05.616
You do not set conditions
of your employment.

20:05.688 --> 20:08.213
And you shall obey!

20:09.692 --> 20:14.322
May l respectfully remind His Majesty
that l am not his servant but his guest!

20:17.099 --> 20:19.693
A guest who is paid.

20:21.904 --> 20:23.997
Education begins tomorrow.

20:25.975 --> 20:29.069
He sounds absolutely dreadful, ifyou ask me.

20:29.178 --> 20:31.237
He did unnerve me, l must say.

20:32.014 --> 20:35.814
Moonshee, why does
the king have so many wives?

20:35.884 --> 20:38.011
That is an excellent question

20:38.087 --> 20:40.078
for your mother.

20:42.524 --> 20:43.582
Mother?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.718
l heard you, Louis.

20:46.428 --> 20:49.522
Well, Siam is a monarchy
just like England.

20:49.632 --> 20:53.068
And one way that a royal family
maintains its control

20:53.135 --> 20:57.731
in the face ofwar and disease
is to have as many children as possible.

20:58.607 --> 21:01.804
So he needs a lot ofwives
to take care ofthem?

21:01.877 --> 21:04.402
A keen observation, darling.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.812
Time for bed. Come and give us a kiss.

21:08.284 --> 21:10.377
Does he love all ofthem?

21:12.354 --> 21:14.219
ln a way.

21:14.290 --> 21:16.622
Like you loved Father?

21:17.660 --> 21:20.151
Things are very different here, Louis.

21:20.262 --> 21:22.321
Even love.

21:22.464 --> 21:24.523
Go on. Offto bed.

21:27.770 --> 21:31.570
Mother, why doesn't Queen Victoria
have a lot of husbands?

21:31.674 --> 21:35.041
Good night, Louis.

21:58.967 --> 22:01.936
l will never forget you... never.

22:03.939 --> 22:05.566
My heart is yours, Tuptim.

22:07.343 --> 22:08.901
l will always love you.

22:09.611 --> 22:11.579
...always, Tuptim.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.141
Remember!

22:16.285 --> 22:17.912
l will never forget you.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.926
Presenting royal school, sir.

22:47.182 --> 22:49.241
ls anything wrong, sir?

22:49.351 --> 22:51.911
No. Nothing at all, Lady Thiang.

22:51.987 --> 22:54.046
Louis, that will be your desk.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.533
Yes. Well, l suppose class is now in session.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.229
Sit down.

23:13.675 --> 23:15.870
Greetings, Mem Leonowens.

23:18.046 --> 23:22.540
My father wish to give sir this
to put on path of good teaching.

23:22.618 --> 23:26.247
Well, l shall certainly
bear that in mind, Your Highness.

23:26.355 --> 23:28.414
May l compliment you on your English?

23:34.863 --> 23:37.764
Siam - population six million,

23:37.833 --> 23:41.860
spreading across 49 bountiful provinces,

23:41.970 --> 23:44.768
from Burma in west to Cambodia in east,

23:44.840 --> 23:47.604
presided over by King Maha Mongkut,

23:47.676 --> 23:52.477
Lord of Life, whose strength
and power reach everywhere.

23:52.614 --> 23:54.980
Not in my house, they don't.

23:56.585 --> 23:59.452
Son ofteacher is forgetting l am son of king.

23:59.588 --> 24:01.613
Son ofteacher couldn't care less.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.090
You will sit somewhere else!

24:04.193 --> 24:05.490
l will not!

24:05.627 --> 24:07.993
Louis, remember what l told you.

24:08.063 --> 24:10.463
l'm sorry, Mother. But he started it.

24:10.599 --> 24:15.866
ln my country, man never tell woman
he is sorry about anything... ever.

24:15.938 --> 24:18.099
lf you had father, you would know that.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.607
You don't have a father! You have a map!

24:20.676 --> 24:21.870
Louis!

24:21.944 --> 24:25.436
- lt's forbidden to touch royalty!
- l didn't! l shovedyou!

24:25.514 --> 24:28.074
Get one ofyour slaves to shove me back!

24:35.157 --> 24:36.886
Get off me!

24:36.959 --> 24:38.449
Let me through. Excuse me.

24:38.527 --> 24:41.257
Stop it, Louis. That's enough!

24:44.466 --> 24:47.094
The nobleman, Thak Chaloemtiarana,

24:47.369 --> 24:50.031
Siam's most prosperous tea merchant,

24:50.472 --> 24:54.101
pledges eternal loyalty and wishes to present

24:54.376 --> 24:57.937
his most beautiful daughter, Tuptim,

24:58.247 --> 25:01.182
for His Majesty's royal favor.

25:15.497 --> 25:17.465
What has happened here?

25:35.684 --> 25:37.276
The British boy

25:37.819 --> 25:40.788
pushed Chulalongkorn, Your Majesty.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.293
Why?

25:57.539 --> 26:00.940
Prince insult memory of boy's father.

26:28.270 --> 26:32.730
998, 999,

26:33.742 --> 26:35.642
1,000.

26:35.777 --> 26:37.369
Finished.

26:37.446 --> 26:38.811
You may go home.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.609
Aren't you coming?

26:40.749 --> 26:44.276
Not until Prince Chulalongkorn
finishes his task.

27:17.486 --> 27:20.580
l'm sorry, Lady Thiang,
but supper will have to wait.

27:20.656 --> 27:23.124
The prince has not yet been dismissed.

27:26.862 --> 27:29.854
His Majesty King Mongkut
afraid schoolteacher

27:29.931 --> 27:32.832
might get hungry during long night ahead.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.631
He send food... for one.

27:46.281 --> 27:48.476
Why does my father humble me?

27:48.550 --> 27:50.643
He wants what's best for you.

27:50.719 --> 27:53.153
For the moment, that includes me.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.314
Why?

27:57.159 --> 27:59.684
Most people do not see the world as it is.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.888
They see it as they are.

28:01.963 --> 28:04.295
And a good king needs a broader view.

28:11.707 --> 28:13.766
Stay here, Your Highness.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.078
What is that smell?!

29:13.368 --> 29:17.805
She has been chained outside for six weeks.
All because she tried to buy her freedom.

29:17.939 --> 29:22.603
Mem Leonowens, Jao Jom Manda Ung
is daughter of very influential family.

29:22.711 --> 29:27.410
Yes. And when La-Ore offered her the money,
she took it. Her mistress took it.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.575
Then she accused her of ingratitude

29:29.651 --> 29:32.779
and chained her like an animal
where the prince and l found her.

29:32.854 --> 29:37.120
Heir to throne must never be involved
in issue of bondservant.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.251
lt will resolve itself in time.

29:39.361 --> 29:40.589
Like my house?

29:40.662 --> 29:42.857
You are learning.

29:49.571 --> 29:53.530
Who would hang women and children?

29:54.075 --> 29:55.599
They were Burmese.

29:56.411 --> 29:58.038
So you've said.

29:58.380 --> 30:02.180
But the puppet who leads Burma
has British strings.

30:02.584 --> 30:06.782
Why would the lmperialists
use such covert tactics?

30:08.757 --> 30:12.386
Because a war with one's neighbors

30:12.894 --> 30:16.227
brings the British to the rescue.

30:19.201 --> 30:21.863
Men like you, Alak, were not built

30:22.204 --> 30:24.468
for so much peace and prosperity.

30:25.907 --> 30:29.866
Peace makes men soft, Your Majesty.

30:30.712 --> 30:34.045
The English define Burma as

30:34.416 --> 30:36.384
a ''British Protectorate''.

30:36.651 --> 30:38.516
Vietnam and Cambodia are known

30:38.820 --> 30:40.913
throughout the world as

30:41.256 --> 30:43.224
''French lndochina''.

30:44.926 --> 30:50.262
What will they call Siam?

30:55.203 --> 30:58.070
l have been doing much thinking,
mem teacher,

30:58.139 --> 31:02.667
on why some in this life are masters,
like Jao Jom Manda Ung,

31:02.744 --> 31:04.837
and others slaves.

31:04.913 --> 31:08.644
That is something you need
to ask your father, Your Highness.

31:08.717 --> 31:10.810
But you are teacher.

31:10.886 --> 31:12.148
Teach.

31:25.734 --> 31:29.830
This American woman - Harriet Beecher
Stowe - asked the same question.

31:29.905 --> 31:33.773
Perhaps you should read her and then
we might continue our discussion.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.274
A woman?

31:40.348 --> 31:42.077
Yes.

31:44.252 --> 31:46.311
Uncle Tom's Cabin.

31:47.856 --> 31:49.915
l shall read it at once, mem.

32:12.547 --> 32:15.516
You're trembling...

32:15.917 --> 32:18.715
Do not fear, blessed one.

32:19.421 --> 32:23.380
His Majesty is a kind and generous lover.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.492
Come along, Louis!

33:41.803 --> 33:44.670
Quickly. We don't want to be late for school.

33:53.648 --> 33:57.982
Were you not commanded
to leave slave issue alone?

33:58.053 --> 34:02.285
Your Excellency, l'm fully prepared
to obey His Majesty's commands

34:02.390 --> 34:04.858
within the obligation of my duties.

34:04.926 --> 34:07.827
Beyond that, l promise no obedience.

34:07.896 --> 34:10.330
You will follow.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.703
She tricked me!

34:25.013 --> 34:26.810
She broke into my home,

34:27.081 --> 34:28.811
set my servant free,

34:29.050 --> 34:31.449
then came to me with an offer

34:31.719 --> 34:34.916
to buy her and made payment!

34:36.291 --> 34:38.350
La-Ore purchased her freedom once,

34:38.460 --> 34:41.554
and l believe, had l given
this woman my ring first,

34:41.663 --> 34:45.531
she would have taken it
and continued to hold La-Ore captive.

34:45.632 --> 34:50.297
King's commitment to noble families
must not be compromised.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.270
ln your letter confirming my employment,

34:54.342 --> 34:58.870
you said you wanted Siam to take its place
among the nations ofthe modern world.

34:58.947 --> 35:01.711
You spoke of building
something greater than yourself.

35:01.783 --> 35:06.277
A country where no man is above the law.
Which is why l chose to come here.

35:10.959 --> 35:14.520
Schoolteacher has outstanding memory.

35:15.463 --> 35:17.693
l want my slave returned

35:18.333 --> 35:22.599
and punishment ofthis insolent English

35:24.405 --> 35:28.364
who dares stand before the Lord of Life!

35:30.011 --> 35:32.343
Kralahome...

35:32.413 --> 35:35.576
lf you would please honor
Jao Jom Manda Ung

35:36.551 --> 35:38.883
with an explanation ofthe law.

35:39.787 --> 35:42.881
Regretfully, l must inform you

35:43.358 --> 35:46.623
that bondservants have the right,

35:46.995 --> 35:50.954
by law, to buy their own freedom.

35:54.035 --> 35:56.697
And what if every slave in my service

35:57.038 --> 36:00.997
should bring me
the price oftheir freedom?

36:01.242 --> 36:04.211
Am l bound to serve myself?

36:07.815 --> 36:10.443
That would be most unfortunate,

36:12.253 --> 36:15.586
my august mistress.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.568
This is a pauper's ring!

36:55.897 --> 36:57.990
Why did you intervene?

37:01.669 --> 37:03.967
My conscience demanded it.

37:04.572 --> 37:06.631
And boys' fisticuffs?

37:06.708 --> 37:08.835
l beg your pardon?

37:08.910 --> 37:13.176
l suppose, since you must be
both mother and father to son,

37:13.248 --> 37:16.240
tendency to overprotect is strong.

37:17.919 --> 37:20.649
Louis can fend for himself, Your Majesty.

37:20.722 --> 37:22.815
lt was your son l was protecting.

37:22.890 --> 37:27.190
Thank you for the supper.
Although l do not think it was necessary.

37:27.262 --> 37:28.786
l know my son.

37:28.863 --> 37:31.093
You would still be there.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.030
Perhaps.

37:33.101 --> 37:37.037
But then my point would have been made,
Your Majesty, not yours.

37:37.138 --> 37:39.197
- l am king.
- Yes.

37:39.274 --> 37:41.504
And l am his schoolteacher.

37:41.609 --> 37:44.009
Which lesson do you think he learnt?

37:44.078 --> 37:47.343
To respect his classmates
or to fear his father?

37:52.954 --> 37:56.651
Husband must have been
very understanding.

38:00.561 --> 38:04.725
My husband was never threatened
by my ideas or my opinions.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.431
And because l am also such

38:09.537 --> 38:14.099
l will allow you to always
stand upright in my presence,

38:14.175 --> 38:18.544
providing head shall
never be higher than mine.

38:20.682 --> 38:23.276
Thank you, Your Majesty.

38:31.159 --> 38:33.184
Your Majesty,

38:33.294 --> 38:37.390
l believe there has been enough insult
caused by this woman,

38:37.532 --> 38:40.558
who believes herself
to be the equal of a man.

38:42.170 --> 38:44.764
Not the equal of a man, Chao Phya.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.667
The equal of a king.

39:04.726 --> 39:08.822
l make this for you tomorrow.

39:09.630 --> 39:12.690
Why, thank you, Fa-Ying. lt's beautiful.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.167
These are monkeys at summer palace.

39:15.236 --> 39:17.329
And this must be you.

39:17.405 --> 39:19.999
l shall hang it on my wall at home.

39:20.108 --> 39:23.236
l will make another for you yesterday.

39:24.379 --> 39:26.574
Then l shall wait for it tomorrow.

39:30.985 --> 39:33.954
- Lady Thiang.
- Good morning, Mem Leonowens.

39:34.021 --> 39:38.219
This is Lady Tuptim.
She's new in palace, also like yourself.

39:41.429 --> 39:46.958
l wish also to learn writing of English to...

39:47.935 --> 39:51.268
to please His Majesty King Mongkut.

39:51.372 --> 39:53.237
Yes, well, certainly.

39:53.341 --> 39:56.868
But l should hope that
it would please Lady Tuptim as well.

40:03.351 --> 40:05.410
And this is for you.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.848
Make sure all ofyour books are open.

40:39.053 --> 40:42.216
Who knows the next letter
in the alphabet after E?

40:42.290 --> 40:44.383
- F.
- F.

40:47.728 --> 40:49.491
Who can tell me which words start with F?

41:31.706 --> 41:33.765
Fa-Ying loves the river.

41:33.875 --> 41:37.504
Yes, she told me
all about herjourney to Ayudhya.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.842
How it is the center ofthe universe.

41:39.914 --> 41:44.112
lt is home to ancient ones
and their many legends.

41:44.185 --> 41:46.176
l told her in England we have Camelot.

41:46.287 --> 41:49.450
And a big round table.

41:49.524 --> 41:51.082
Yes, that's right.

41:51.158 --> 41:54.924
Everyone should have legends, l think.
lt allows us to dream.

41:54.996 --> 41:58.659
You're an interesting mix
of fact and fancy, mem.

41:58.766 --> 42:02.532
l suppose it's because
l'm always surrounded by children.

42:02.603 --> 42:05.902
Teaching the young
is fulfilling endeavorment.

42:06.574 --> 42:08.667
l didn't have a choice really.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.608
Buddhists believe all life is suffering.

42:14.749 --> 42:19.209
Take away pain of husband's death...
takes away mem's chance to grow.

42:21.355 --> 42:24.688
- We might have preferred a different lesson.
- Yes.

42:24.792 --> 42:29.752
But unique opportunity to change world
would have passed to someone else.

42:38.539 --> 42:41.337
Louis. Do try and stay in the boat, darling.

42:42.510 --> 42:47.948
He asked about your flag and the significance
of the white elephant. l had no answer.

42:48.015 --> 42:50.313
Louis Leonowens!

42:57.592 --> 42:58.991
Yes, Your Majesty?

42:59.060 --> 43:00.925
l am teacher now.

43:02.630 --> 43:04.257
The flag of Siam.

43:04.365 --> 43:06.424
- Red is for?
- Courage.

43:06.534 --> 43:08.627
- White?
- Compassion.

43:08.736 --> 43:13.673
The white elephant is Siam's
most rare and honored creature.

43:13.808 --> 43:17.539
Perhaps on journey to rice festival
we will all see one.

43:17.612 --> 43:19.671
Rice festival?

43:19.814 --> 43:21.076
Mother!

43:21.182 --> 43:22.410
Mother, look!

43:22.483 --> 43:24.576
There's Moonshee and Beebe!

43:26.954 --> 43:29.354
l trust you will find ample space

43:29.423 --> 43:32.586
for engaging in English traditions.

43:32.660 --> 43:35.151
Even for growing of roses.

43:35.229 --> 43:38.824
Out of curiosity,
is this because of our agreement

43:38.899 --> 43:41.299
or are you simply trying to get rid of me?

43:43.638 --> 43:45.401
Yes.

43:56.984 --> 44:00.249
A little soap and water,
and we will have a fine house, mem.

44:02.857 --> 44:04.722
Shall l make us some tea?

44:04.859 --> 44:07.487
Yes. That would be lovely.

44:47.268 --> 44:50.169
l remember my first rice festival.

44:50.271 --> 44:52.899
People come from everywhere to see king.

44:52.973 --> 44:56.966
He bless all crops, and it begin to rain.

44:57.078 --> 44:59.239
l think he was a god.

45:01.348 --> 45:03.441
And now?

45:04.952 --> 45:07.386
He is also a man.

45:10.491 --> 45:13.756
l feel very fortunate that we're invited.

45:14.729 --> 45:18.165
One cannot see Siam's beauty
living in Bangkok, mem.

45:19.800 --> 45:26.672
The mountains are so green and the skies
are more blue than even your eyes.

45:27.575 --> 45:29.202
l must find Louis.

45:29.310 --> 45:31.369
Louis!

45:41.889 --> 45:45.586
- May l ask a favor, mem?
- Yes, certainly.

45:47.161 --> 45:49.527
To send this.

45:50.564 --> 45:54.295
l wish family to know
how happy l am here with king.

45:55.402 --> 45:58.894
l'll tell Moonshee
to find a messenger straight away.

45:59.406 --> 46:00.430
Mem...

46:01.442 --> 46:03.535
May l ask a question?

46:03.611 --> 46:05.010
Yes.

46:06.180 --> 46:08.239
How did husband die?

46:09.950 --> 46:12.180
ln my arms, actually.

46:16.423 --> 46:19.187
How did mem survive?

46:21.529 --> 46:23.588
Just as you will.

46:23.664 --> 46:25.757
One awful day at a time.

46:37.945 --> 46:40.880
Mem sha, Louis is teasing me.

46:40.981 --> 46:45.577
He say in England coldness
fall from sky like tiny feathers.

46:45.653 --> 46:47.746
Why would l lie about snow?

46:47.822 --> 46:51.383
Please, mem, it is too hot.
Can make some now?

46:51.458 --> 46:56.157
Just because your father can make it rain
doesn't mean l can make it snow.

46:56.230 --> 46:59.597
At last l discover her limitations.

46:59.667 --> 47:01.760
l have many, Your Majesty.

47:01.836 --> 47:04.361
Father, will you make it snow, please?

47:05.306 --> 47:07.399
Even for you, l cannot.

47:07.474 --> 47:10.500
But l've seen photographs
of such phenomenon.

47:10.611 --> 47:12.977
Blankets of it... up to here!

47:15.082 --> 47:17.778
Louis... Smoke?

47:18.452 --> 47:20.010
Me? Jolly good!

47:20.120 --> 47:22.281
No. No!

47:22.389 --> 47:24.584
But, Mother, he's the king.

47:24.658 --> 47:26.319
My father smoked too.

47:26.427 --> 47:30.022
Yes, but your father had already
achieved his full height.

47:30.130 --> 47:33.327
l have been smoking since age six.

47:33.434 --> 47:36.870
And some believe me
to be a giant among men.

47:36.937 --> 47:41.101
Yes. ln intelligence
as well as stature, Your Majesty.

47:41.208 --> 47:45.042
Which is why, Louis,
l'm sure His Majesty was only teasing.

47:45.913 --> 47:51.044
l believe now is good time for all children
to spread amazing concept of snow

47:51.151 --> 47:53.244
to cool off court. Yes?

47:53.320 --> 47:55.413
Yes!

47:59.059 --> 48:01.619
l simply meant to open conversation

48:01.695 --> 48:04.061
in controversial fashion

48:04.164 --> 48:06.655
mem is so fond of.

48:08.535 --> 48:11.527
l do have my opinions,
but they're merely that.

48:11.639 --> 48:17.305
l wish to compliment you for enlightening
children to open minds and taste life.

48:18.846 --> 48:19.870
However,

48:19.947 --> 48:23.542
at this time
l shall not offer cigar to your son

48:23.651 --> 48:28.486
and you shall not teach this book to mine.

48:33.093 --> 48:39.259
Chulalongkorn has many questions, but one
cannot plow new fields in Siam overnight.

48:39.967 --> 48:42.060
l understand, Your Majesty.

50:04.418 --> 50:07.979
Honestly, Louis.
l leave you alone for five minutes...

50:09.089 --> 50:11.182
lt was his idea.

50:11.291 --> 50:15.990
Just because Prince Chulalongkorn jumps off
a bridge doesn't mean you must as well.

50:16.063 --> 50:19.260
How can anyone smoke those things?

50:19.366 --> 50:21.891
Your father certainly enjoyed them.

50:26.507 --> 50:28.600
ls that why you like him?

50:28.675 --> 50:31.906
The king, l mean.
Because he reminds you of Father?

50:34.681 --> 50:38.082
l think that cigar
has clouded your brain, young man.

50:39.019 --> 50:40.646
Go on. Go to sleep.

50:52.499 --> 50:56.094
You drag me out at night
and turn down five pounds a bushel?!

50:56.203 --> 51:00.139
- French offer seven!
- What is the matter with you people?!

51:00.240 --> 51:04.540
You seem to have a very high opinion
of the quality ofyour produce!

51:04.645 --> 51:08.741
That is the best price you're gonna get!
l'm not gonna offer any more!

51:10.317 --> 51:12.410
What are we waiting for?

51:14.121 --> 51:17.454
The Englishman must not be harmed.

52:16.884 --> 52:23.483
No one knows where
these death squads will strike next.

52:23.824 --> 52:25.223
Then we must strike back

52:25.592 --> 52:27.958
and with twice the venom!

52:28.295 --> 52:30.286
Strike who, my brother?

52:30.564 --> 52:33.590
The enemy still has no form.

52:34.168 --> 52:36.500
Loyalists to Your Majesty

52:36.770 --> 52:39.398
are strung up to rot.

52:39.706 --> 52:41.571
Merchants who reject British traders

52:41.775 --> 52:44.039
are murdered in their homes.

52:44.411 --> 52:48.313
England may hide
behind Burmese assassins

52:48.949 --> 52:51.645
but the stench is still British!

52:54.988 --> 52:58.253
One of us is wrong about the British.

52:59.159 --> 53:03.118
l will assemble the Officers at once.

53:04.131 --> 53:05.598
No.

53:05.866 --> 53:07.527
lf you are right about the British,

53:07.734 --> 53:12.034
this war cannot be won on a battlefield.

53:12.239 --> 53:13.729
Your Majesty,

53:14.007 --> 53:16.635
if we do not stop
these colonial predators,

53:16.877 --> 53:18.606
who will?

53:22.216 --> 53:26.619
Now, we all know that this egg
will never fit into this bottle.

53:27.754 --> 53:29.881
lt's a fact. lt's the truth.

53:29.990 --> 53:33.153
And we rely on truth
to make judgments, don't we?

53:33.227 --> 53:38.665
What if ourjudgment is wrong, even when
we know for a fact that it must be right?

53:38.765 --> 53:42.394
Do we rely on our eyes
or do we believe in the impossible?

53:52.479 --> 53:57.610
You see, one way to achieve
the impossible is to change the climate.

54:03.790 --> 54:05.724
Leave us.

54:14.735 --> 54:18.728
The French say l am uncivilized ruler.

54:19.473 --> 54:22.909
l, who have spent entire life

54:23.010 --> 54:27.037
attempting to teach self
history, literature, and science.

54:27.214 --> 54:30.047
Why would they print such things,
Your Majesty?

54:30.117 --> 54:34.053
You are English.
You should not be so surprised.

54:34.921 --> 54:37.014
Well, l can still be appalled.

54:37.090 --> 54:39.149
More importantly,

54:39.259 --> 54:44.162
do you, as a foreigner, see me in this light?

54:45.632 --> 54:48.658
l do not know all that you are, Your Majesty.

54:48.735 --> 54:51.295
But l believe l know what you're not.

54:51.371 --> 54:53.464
And you are not what they say.

54:55.175 --> 54:58.576
Thank you, mem... for humble validation.

55:02.149 --> 55:05.482
l have decided to give self
anniversary dinner

55:05.585 --> 55:09.146
and invite important
English nobles and diplomats.

55:09.256 --> 55:11.383
l don't understand.

55:11.491 --> 55:15.086
French lndochina grows stronger
and more aggressive.

55:15.162 --> 55:20.759
But if l improve our foreign intercourse
with your queen's special envoy,

55:20.867 --> 55:25.133
French will think three times
before trying to undermine Siam.

55:26.807 --> 55:29.071
That's very clever, Your Majesty.

55:32.913 --> 55:36.178
As ifto sound English bugles
in own defense.

55:36.283 --> 55:39.343
You shall take charge of all formalities

55:39.419 --> 55:43.219
as mem is obvious choice
to make certain guests feel at home.

55:43.323 --> 55:45.985
But... the anniversary is when?

55:46.093 --> 55:48.118
Three weeks from yesterday.

55:48.195 --> 55:51.653
Three weeks?! That's impossible.

55:52.699 --> 55:54.997
Mem...

55:55.102 --> 55:56.535
The egg

55:56.636 --> 55:59.127
is in the bottle.

56:41.782 --> 56:44.046
Only half a glass.

56:59.232 --> 57:03.635
We cannot have the servant bowing
every time somebody walks into the banquet.

57:03.770 --> 57:05.829
l understand.

57:34.301 --> 57:37.395
Just for one night.

57:37.471 --> 57:39.905
Thank you, Your Majesty.

57:54.154 --> 57:57.555
Sorry for nervousness.
This is first time in Siam history

57:57.657 --> 58:01.252
that king allow everyone
to stand up in his presence.

58:02.062 --> 58:04.292
But only for tonight.

58:04.865 --> 58:08.528
Your country and mine
have much in common, Your Majesty.

58:08.635 --> 58:11.468
Rich cultures. Long histories.

58:11.538 --> 58:13.802
And now, it seems, Mrs Leonowens.

58:13.907 --> 58:15.306
Yes.

58:15.375 --> 58:20.278
My children's horizons keep
expanding under her tutelage.

58:22.516 --> 58:26.782
My husband and l have been
stationed all over the Orient.

58:26.887 --> 58:30.983
But l must say... l've never
seen anything quite like this.

58:31.091 --> 58:33.150
Extraordinary, isn't it?

58:33.894 --> 58:37.728
Grand Palace born from
the mind of King Taksin.

58:37.864 --> 58:40.560
First man to unify all Siam.

58:40.667 --> 58:45.400
Our country owes its creation
to a man they declared insane.

58:45.505 --> 58:49.908
Well, these rooftops are a little nutty.

58:51.211 --> 58:53.702
He endeavored to build an empire,

58:53.813 --> 58:59.012
but the nobility that ran Siam
for generations had grown tired of his wars

58:59.119 --> 59:04.318
and replaced him with Mongkut's
grandfather, someone they could influence.

59:04.391 --> 59:09.158
Taksin they put in a velvet sack,
beaten to death with a sandalwood club,

59:09.229 --> 59:11.493
and buried somewhere in palace.

59:11.565 --> 59:12.623
Oh, dear.

59:12.732 --> 59:15.963
lt sounds as though you admire him, general.

59:16.036 --> 59:21.099
l admire vision, Lady Bradley, in all its forms.

59:39.426 --> 59:44.454
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
l believe the sun set a little earlier today.

59:44.564 --> 59:46.259
Mem.

59:46.366 --> 59:50.234
You arrange all this
to influence positive future of Siam.

59:51.571 --> 59:55.063
And now you steal attention away from it.

59:57.477 --> 01:00:00.605
Well, that was not my intention,
Your Majesty.

01:00:01.281 --> 01:00:03.272
Mrs Leonowens.

01:00:03.383 --> 01:00:05.442
What a delightful surprise,

01:00:05.552 --> 01:00:10.182
encountering such an enchanting
countryman. And so far from home.

01:00:10.256 --> 01:00:13.157
Lord Bradley, this is indeed a great honor.

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:20.698
l'm half-crazy

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.395
All for the love ofyou

01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:28.202
lt won't be a stylish marriage

01:00:28.274 --> 01:00:32.108
l can't afford a carriage

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:35.511
But you'll look sweet upon the seat

01:00:35.615 --> 01:00:40.052
Of a bicycle made for two

01:00:48.261 --> 01:00:51.424
Gracious ladies, kind sirs,

01:00:51.498 --> 01:00:56.697
on behalf of 68 brothers and sisters,
we thank you immeasurably

01:00:56.803 --> 01:00:59.237
and bid you most gracious evening.

01:01:09.949 --> 01:01:14.352
Your son bears a striking resemblance
to his father, Mrs Leonowens.

01:01:14.454 --> 01:01:18.117
l had the good fortune
of serving with him a few years ago.

01:01:18.224 --> 01:01:20.283
He was a courageous soldier, ma'am.

01:01:22.128 --> 01:01:24.221
l thank you, Captain Blake.

01:01:24.297 --> 01:01:28.131
Father, may l please kiss good night?

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:39.911
lf l may beg indulgence
for not wishing to break family tradition.

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:52.121
l will be there in your dreams

01:01:52.192 --> 01:01:54.285
as you will be in mine.

01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:57.788
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:02:04.738 --> 01:02:08.333
You have
a remarkable family, King Mongkut.

01:02:08.408 --> 01:02:11.275
A remarkably large one.

01:02:11.344 --> 01:02:13.403
Hardly seems fair.

01:02:13.513 --> 01:02:15.777
All these women for one man.

01:02:15.882 --> 01:02:18.817
Makes me wish l was Siamese myself.

01:02:21.788 --> 01:02:27.021
Mycroft Kincaid...
of East lndia Trading Company. Correct?

01:02:27.127 --> 01:02:29.721
Guilty as charged, Your Majesty.

01:02:29.796 --> 01:02:35.428
Mr Kincaid's company is merely one ofthe
ways we try to foster economic relations

01:02:35.535 --> 01:02:38.095
with other countries, Your Majesty.

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:43.165
Also, l think, to arrive at forefront
of world in wealth and power.

01:02:43.243 --> 01:02:44.267
Yes?

01:02:48.314 --> 01:02:52.842
Still, progress through commerce is logic.

01:02:52.952 --> 01:02:58.117
King find most practical
and excellent topic for discussion.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:02.787
With all due respect, Your Majesty,
it is a little far-fetched to think

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:06.423
that commerce alone
will bring progress to your people.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:10.401
Especially when they're awash
with superstition and fear.

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:14.065
Like your lovely concubines here
with their talismans,

01:03:14.174 --> 01:03:17.666
worn, no doubt, to protect them
from us foreign devils.

01:03:28.154 --> 01:03:32.250
A friend once said, Mr Kincaid,

01:03:32.358 --> 01:03:35.327
English also have fantastical beliefs.

01:03:36.696 --> 01:03:41.565
Or am l mistaking your country
for being land of Merlin and Camelot?

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:45.462
Point taken, Your Majesty.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:50.669
However, there is no arguing
the superiority ofthe English.

01:03:50.777 --> 01:03:55.077
And in the light ofthese dreadful massacres
up and down your border,

01:03:55.215 --> 01:03:58.776
it's no wonder you're seeking our favor.

01:03:58.852 --> 01:04:02.185
Superiority, Mr Kincaid? l do not recall

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:06.658
anyone being given the right to judge
whose culture or customs are superior.

01:04:06.726 --> 01:04:11.493
Especially when those judging have
frequently done so at the point of gun.

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.834
Would you not agree, Your Majesty?

01:04:19.239 --> 01:04:21.036
Quite.

01:04:22.876 --> 01:04:27.745
Well... the evenings here
are certainly warmer than in London.

01:04:27.847 --> 01:04:30.247
Hear, hear!

01:04:30.316 --> 01:04:33.479
A night made to order for anniversary party.

01:04:33.553 --> 01:04:39.048
Especially for a king who is
most charitable and forgiving.

01:04:41.895 --> 01:04:43.487
To our host!

01:04:43.563 --> 01:04:46.691
A true gentleman, generous in every way.

01:04:46.766 --> 01:04:51.669
May history mark this occasion
as the first step

01:04:51.738 --> 01:04:55.538
towards forging an alliance
between our two countries.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:56.904
His Majesty!

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:59.069
His Majesty!

01:05:08.554 --> 01:05:12.456
And in honor
of our most distinguished guests

01:05:12.525 --> 01:05:17.360
a waltz, as is European custom
of dancing after dinner.

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:14.912
l must tell you, Your Majesty,
that l have not done this in some time

01:06:14.988 --> 01:06:18.151
and, seeing as the evening
has gone so well,

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:21.421
we wouldn't want to end up
in a heap now, would we?

01:06:21.527 --> 01:06:24.052
l am king. l shall lead.

01:06:27.533 --> 01:06:30.730
l never danced with
an Englishwoman before, mem.

01:06:30.803 --> 01:06:32.862
Nor l with a king.

01:06:33.539 --> 01:06:38.875
l want you to make promise, mem, to always
tell king what you think, no matter what.

01:06:38.978 --> 01:06:41.344
Like to man from East lndia Company.

01:06:43.483 --> 01:06:45.576
l always have.

01:07:42.891 --> 01:07:44.859
Mem.

01:07:44.926 --> 01:07:47.190
You're humming.

01:07:47.262 --> 01:07:49.822
Yes, l suppose l am.

01:07:49.898 --> 01:07:54.665
As alarming as this may sound, Beebe,
l'm feeling rather at home here now.

01:07:54.736 --> 01:08:00.003
What charming people, hm? You remember
when this marketplace used to terrify us?

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:02.805
Like it was yesterday.

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:05.847
l was afraid that dinner might unsettle you.

01:08:05.914 --> 01:08:08.644
All those Englishmen in uniform.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:12.551
Yes. l thought it would
make me miserably homesick.

01:08:12.654 --> 01:08:16.715
Quite the opposite.
l rather enjoyed myself. Even the dancing.

01:08:16.825 --> 01:08:18.884
Shall we get some ofthese?

01:08:38.313 --> 01:08:42.340
And how did His Majesty fare
amongst all your countrymen?

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:44.975
He was charming. Absolutely charming.

01:08:46.787 --> 01:08:52.158
l don't think l'll ever forget how he stood
there, holding his hand out as if l was...

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:54.319
One of his 26 wives?

01:08:55.162 --> 01:08:58.929
Well, thank you, Beebe.
l hadn't thought of it in that way.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.093
Well, perhaps you should.

01:09:19.888 --> 01:09:22.755
We have been searching
for our Burmese killers

01:09:23.925 --> 01:09:26.359
here, here, and here,

01:09:26.995 --> 01:09:30.953
except no one
has seen them for weeks.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:35.395
Which is all the more reason
to keep looking.

01:09:39.573 --> 01:09:42.839
Yes, but not up here.

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:47.773
You once told me
Taksin marched on Burma

01:09:48.116 --> 01:09:50.640
through Three Pagodas Pass.

01:09:50.919 --> 01:09:54.855
Could they not invade the same way?

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:59.591
To march an army through there
would take months.

01:09:59.794 --> 01:10:01.762
Yes, and how long have we

01:10:01.963 --> 01:10:03.931
been searching up North?

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:12.605
Assemble a regiment at once.

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.980
l have a surprise for you.

01:10:26.888 --> 01:10:28.082
How...

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:30.248
How did you...

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.952
l'm not quite sure, actually.

01:10:35.297 --> 01:10:36.764
Thank you, mem.

01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:40.164
My family... is very important to me.

01:10:41.202 --> 01:10:43.898
l shall leave you to enjoy every word then.

01:11:01.856 --> 01:11:03.255
Your Majesty?

01:11:04.659 --> 01:11:06.718
- You sent for me?
- Ah, yes.

01:11:06.828 --> 01:11:07.852
But here...

01:11:07.929 --> 01:11:10.022
Look.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.995
Something tells me
my little monkey did not go to bed

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:18.471
- night of anniversary.
- Yes, l know.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:22.236
l've been presented with drawings
of couples dancing ever since.

01:11:27.015 --> 01:11:28.039
Come.

01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:39.051
Sit, please.

01:11:52.173 --> 01:11:56.075
Perhaps you should simply say
what it is you're trying so hard not to.

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.080
l share this with you, mem,

01:12:04.152 --> 01:12:06.950
because l believe you to be trustworthy.

01:12:09.357 --> 01:12:14.158
Events are happening which
l now believe to be of Burmese origin,

01:12:14.262 --> 01:12:18.198
and l fear that military action is unavoidable.

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.959
But Burma is British.

01:12:24.706 --> 01:12:25.934
Yes.

01:12:28.376 --> 01:12:31.971
Then it is not the French that
you were worried about, was it?

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.353
l see.

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:56.699
On table, mem, is small gift of appreciation
for your many efforts at anniversary party.

01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:18.382
Mem's hand

01:13:19.594 --> 01:13:21.653
has been lonely without such.

01:13:24.065 --> 01:13:26.966
lt is... most kind, Your Majesty.

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:29.128
lt's very beautiful.

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.365
Though l am terribly grateful...

01:13:31.439 --> 01:13:33.771
lt is custom to bestow favors

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:39.474
for those who... who please king.
And mem has done so.

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:45.210
l'm sorry. l cannot accept such generosity.

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:10.272
l hardly think ten days' rain
warrants the call to battle, Louis.

01:14:10.378 --> 01:14:12.676
May l suggest a retreat?

01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:21.044
Mother, l think l should have
a topknot like the other boys.

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:24.481
l think you've gone a bit daft, darling.

01:14:24.592 --> 01:14:27.026
With all this rain, it's no wonder.

01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:29.427
l don't see why l have to miss school.

01:14:29.497 --> 01:14:33.695
Because your classroom's under water,
and l cannot have you ill.

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:51.416
My mostprecious Tuptim.

01:14:51.486 --> 01:14:55.013
l knowyou will understand
why lmust write this to you.

01:14:55.089 --> 01:15:00.049
When you were torn from myheart,
l was left with nothing butmyfaith.

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:05.623
Which is why, iflam to live,
l must devote mylife to Buddha.

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.225
For onlyhe can give me peace.

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:11.504
l willneverforgetyou.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:14.358
Fa-Ying was found
in the garden, riddled with fever.

01:16:14.435 --> 01:16:17.700
Difficult even fora grown man
to survive such.

01:16:17.772 --> 01:16:22.004
Cholera always in world
but still hardly at all in Bangkok.

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:26.206
- ls there nothing you can do?
- They have already begun. Listen.

01:16:26.314 --> 01:16:31.342
Phra Arahan. Reminding soul
to go to heaven and not lose way.

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:36.557
lt is why mem must not be heard weeping,

01:16:36.624 --> 01:16:41.357
as her soul will attach to sadness
and remain to comfort living.

01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:47.726
His Majesty is grateful.

01:16:48.803 --> 01:16:52.671
The little one has made
frequent mention of sir's name.

01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:03.023
lnside!

01:21:04.058 --> 01:21:06.686
l take all meals inside!

01:21:06.794 --> 01:21:08.853
Your Majesty?

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:13.629
Being as the rain has stopped, the children
hoped you mightjoin them for a picnic.

01:21:21.609 --> 01:21:23.634
Mem.

01:21:23.711 --> 01:21:27.203
l will always remember
your feelings for my daughter.

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:32.108
And you shall never forget
you are not here to teach king.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.018
The children miss you terribly, Your Majesty.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.485
You cannot shut the world out for ever.

01:21:41.562 --> 01:21:44.030
Believe me, l've tried.

01:21:44.098 --> 01:21:47.864
When my Tom died, l thought
that my heart would never mend.

01:21:48.869 --> 01:21:51.030
But then there was Louis.

01:21:51.105 --> 01:21:53.471
He was my salvation, you see.

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:57.341
And yet you still refuse to live.

01:21:57.445 --> 01:21:59.913
l beg your pardon?

01:22:04.785 --> 01:22:06.685
A mother,

01:22:06.754 --> 01:22:08.551
a teacher,

01:22:08.656 --> 01:22:09.918
a widow.

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:12.323
But you're neverjust... woman.

01:22:12.893 --> 01:22:14.952
That is not fair.

01:22:15.062 --> 01:22:20.898
ln spite of all you say,
mem is not accepting passing of husband.

01:22:20.968 --> 01:22:23.061
lt is why you so protect son,

01:22:23.137 --> 01:22:26.573
and why you devote all time
to books and issues,

01:22:26.674 --> 01:22:29.199
and why you cannot accept gift!

01:22:29.343 --> 01:22:31.402
Why are you doing this?

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.608
Because you lie even to yourself.

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:38.875
So do not lecture me about living.

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:42.081
You are not qualified.

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:34.125
These hours are meant for sleep.

01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:38.329
You startled me.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.299
l thought it wise to do so.

01:24:45.846 --> 01:24:49.942
May l ask what His Majesty is doing awake
at such an ungodly hour?

01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:52.245
Gazing at the moon.

01:24:53.287 --> 01:24:55.949
Yes, she's beautiful.

01:24:56.056 --> 01:25:00.049
As the sun rises, she will surrender the night.

01:25:01.028 --> 01:25:04.725
But she is always with him,
even when he cannot see her.

01:25:06.934 --> 01:25:09.767
That must be a great comfort to him.

01:25:12.339 --> 01:25:14.170
Yes.

01:25:18.946 --> 01:25:23.315
This come from Bangkok.
You may find it of some interest.

01:25:24.785 --> 01:25:26.878
- lt's from...
- Yes.

01:25:26.954 --> 01:25:28.649
Please to read.

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:32.184
As monkey has stolen king's spectacles.

01:25:35.863 --> 01:25:41.199
''Your Majesty, the United States
sincerely appreciates your generous offer

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.896
to help end this tragic conflict.''

01:25:43.971 --> 01:25:49.409
''Unfortunately our country does not reach
a latitude which favors the elephant.''

01:25:49.543 --> 01:25:53.946
''We are, however, highly grateful
for this indication offriendship.''

01:25:54.014 --> 01:25:56.949
''Your good friend, Abraham Lincoln.''

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:04.221
l admire this man for what
he is trying to do for his people.

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:11.094
They say at the Battle ofAntietam,
70,000 men killed each other in one day.

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:15.295
And each one ofthose soldiers
has a father who grieves.

01:26:15.369 --> 01:26:17.963
l'm father to all of Siam.

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:22.300
Mem is not wrong about moving on.

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:25.904
Neither were you, Your Majesty.

01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:41.056
When we return, it is time for teacher
to teach Chulalongkorn and others

01:26:41.161 --> 01:26:45.461
any subject she wish,
as long as king know first,

01:26:45.599 --> 01:26:48.227
so can be prepared for consequences.

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.429
l will do my best, Your Majesty.

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:59.003
And l was always believing
Englishwomen slept in hats!

01:27:21.635 --> 01:27:24.229
l have been wondering, mem.

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:27.468
When it's my son's time to become king,

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:29.975
will he be a good one?

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:32.877
Well, he is still a boy, Your Majesty.

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:37.781
But a keenly intelligent one,
with a warm heart and sympathetic soul.

01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:40.319
Qualities, l believe, of a great king.

01:27:44.024 --> 01:27:47.118
l want to thank you
for bringing me here - to Siam.

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:51.129
l cannot imagine anywhere l would rather be.

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:56.327
Were you happy in Bombay?

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:58.496
l was never unhappy.

01:27:58.606 --> 01:28:02.303
But... l find myselftraveling
from place to place,

01:28:02.409 --> 01:28:05.435
wondering where it is that l belong exactly.

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:09.675
And l find myself here.

01:28:10.217 --> 01:28:12.947
Your path is as it should be.

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:17.520
My mind has taken me
down many roads of late.

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:21.417
All ofwhich lead absolutely nowhere.

01:28:23.263 --> 01:28:25.322
What would Buddha say ofthat?

01:28:27.334 --> 01:28:29.962
That roads are forjourneys, mem.

01:28:32.506 --> 01:28:33.973
Not destinations.

01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:42.876
Don't your wives ever getjealous?

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:46.044
l do not understand significance of question.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:49.886
- Forgive me. l was prying.
- No. Please, continue.

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:53.750
Well, most ofthe world believes that

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:57.092
a man and a woman
should share a relationship

01:28:57.164 --> 01:28:59.792
which is sacred only unto themselves.

01:29:03.937 --> 01:29:06.906
Each one of my wives
believes same about king.

01:29:08.308 --> 01:29:11.004
Not everyone can marry you, Your Majesty.

01:29:11.111 --> 01:29:13.170
Good thing.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.612
King need his rest sometime.

01:29:34.101 --> 01:29:37.366
Burmese camp, General,

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:40.368
just over that ridge.

01:30:38.365 --> 01:30:40.629
Let us hope they are better cook

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:43.166
than they are soldiers.

01:30:46.006 --> 01:30:48.600
We will camp here tonight.

01:31:13.133 --> 01:31:16.728
Your country owes you a debt of gratitude.

01:31:18.338 --> 01:31:21.637
Your instincts were excellent,
Your Highness.

01:31:22.442 --> 01:31:24.410
They ran offtoo quickly.

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:45.721
To His Majesty and the greatness of Siam.

01:32:01.481 --> 01:32:05.440
You will not drink to your own brother?

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:12.583
You said my instincts were good.

01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:17.055
And what are they telling you?

01:32:18.465 --> 01:32:20.763
That you are not drinking either.

01:33:17.958 --> 01:33:21.917
My soldiers needed palace uniforms.

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:25.462
You poisoned your own regiment!?

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:32.236
Yes. ln war, innocent people die.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:38.603
But only a war will cleanse this nation

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:44.414
of its Western parasites.

01:33:48.455 --> 01:33:51.424
Take comfort, Chowfa,

01:33:51.992 --> 01:33:54.961
your brother and his children
will soon be joining you.

01:34:47.881 --> 01:34:51.442
All the bodies were stripped
and left to the sun.

01:34:52.152 --> 01:34:58.148
l fear Prince Chowfa and Alak
were cremated with the others.

01:34:59.626 --> 01:35:03.494
May their souls rest in peace.

01:35:05.665 --> 01:35:09.931
You couldn't have prevented
your brother's death, Your Majesty.

01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:12.130
Send my armies north.

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:17.142
lf Burma wants this war, they shall have it.

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:25.313
Lord Bradley?

01:35:25.385 --> 01:35:29.446
Lady Bradley, Mr Kincaid.
lf l might have a moment ofyour time.

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:31.684
l'm afraid a moment is all we have.

01:35:31.758 --> 01:35:34.727
We are leaving on the next boat,
and so should you.

01:35:35.495 --> 01:35:38.487
- My life is here, Lady Bradley.
- Nasty business.

01:35:38.565 --> 01:35:41.159
All this sabre-rattling.

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:43.793
Not good for trade, l can tell you.

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:47.670
The king's brother is most likely dead,
as is his general.

01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:50.539
l would hardly call his action unprovoked.

01:35:51.511 --> 01:35:53.809
What can l do for you, Mrs Leonowens?

01:35:55.682 --> 01:35:58.310
Are the British behind these attacks on Siam?

01:35:58.385 --> 01:36:01.548
Huh! Stick to teaching, Mrs Leonowens!

01:36:01.621 --> 01:36:04.681
lt's obvious you know nothing about politics.

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:08.524
Burma would not make a move
without England's blessing. That l know.

01:36:08.595 --> 01:36:10.688
Precisely.

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:16.964
But ifthis crisis isn't resolved soon and a
country under our protection is threatened,

01:36:17.037 --> 01:36:20.006
we will have no choice
but to defend our interests.

01:36:21.441 --> 01:36:23.102
Our protection?

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:25.303
Our interests?

01:36:25.378 --> 01:36:28.779
The ways of England
are the ways ofthe world, my dear.

01:36:28.849 --> 01:36:33.718
They are the ways of one world, Lady
Bradley. One l am ashamed to call my own.

01:36:33.787 --> 01:36:37.223
You forget yourself, madam.
Now ifyou'll excuse us.

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:39.155
No, l will not.

01:36:39.259 --> 01:36:41.352
You raised your glass to him!

01:36:41.428 --> 01:36:43.589
You commended him for his vision.

01:36:43.663 --> 01:36:47.224
And all the while you were waiting
to take his country from him.

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:51.668
How the empire conducts its business
is really none ofyour concern.

01:36:52.272 --> 01:36:56.766
The last time l inquired, Lord Bradley,
l was still a British subject.

01:36:56.843 --> 01:37:01.473
A fact you would do well to remember
next time you're cheek to cheek with the king.

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:24.098
Forgive me, but my Lady Tuptim
is in great danger.

01:37:24.771 --> 01:37:26.398
l am Phim.

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:30.473
Someone found her in the monastery.

01:37:30.777 --> 01:37:34.770
She must speak with you.
Only Buddha can save her now.

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:48.452
What is it?

01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:02.433
Oh, my dear girl.

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:03.999
What have you done?

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:09.015
What l have done is not result of king

01:38:09.082 --> 01:38:11.141
or intention to dishonor.

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:15.815
A concubine's heart
is of no consequence to king,

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:19.154
consumed with matters
of the whole universe.

01:38:19.259 --> 01:38:22.558
But, Tuptim, why did you not come to me?

01:38:25.131 --> 01:38:27.531
The king might have understood.

01:38:27.634 --> 01:38:30.262
You simply can't do this to him - not now!

01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:37.473
lf love was a choice, who would
ever choose such exquisite pain?

01:38:38.878 --> 01:38:41.676
This is what l need His Majesty to know.

01:38:41.748 --> 01:38:44.546
lf such does not compromise you.

01:38:45.919 --> 01:38:48.581
l will tell him anything you wish.

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:55.161
l thank Buddha for giving me direction.

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:58.530
And now, with mem before me,

01:38:58.598 --> 01:39:02.466
l thank him for giving me true friend.

01:39:08.742 --> 01:39:10.004
Halt!

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:11.911
Halt!

01:39:12.679 --> 01:39:14.613
Stay where you are!

01:39:38.705 --> 01:39:41.230
Lady Tuptim, you are accused

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:44.201
of a traitorous act

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:47.042
against His Majesty, King Mongkut,

01:39:47.747 --> 01:39:50.238
which carries the penalty

01:39:51.451 --> 01:39:53.009
of death.

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:57.052
Please describe for the Court

01:39:57.657 --> 01:40:00.148
the events as they occurred.

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:06.227
Why say anything
if l am not to be treated fairly?

01:40:17.577 --> 01:40:20.410
ls this not the priest

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:23.274
whose letter was found

01:40:23.883 --> 01:40:26.181
in your chamber,

01:40:26.386 --> 01:40:28.616
written in English,

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:32.485
in hope, no doubt,

01:40:33.226 --> 01:40:36.957
to disguise its lascivious intent?

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:40.198
Fear not, Tuptim,

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.495
all life is suffering.

01:40:45.905 --> 01:40:47.873
Speak now, woman, or the cane shall be

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:50.668
applied to you at once.

01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:53.676
My Lords,

01:40:54.814 --> 01:40:58.079
His Holiness, Balat, is the only man

01:40:58.451 --> 01:40:59.850
l have ever loved,

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:03.819
and being taken from him

01:41:04.524 --> 01:41:06.116
was to deny

01:41:06.593 --> 01:41:09.323
air to my lungs.

01:41:12.665 --> 01:41:16.795
His Majesty does not need me,

01:41:22.041 --> 01:41:27.069
but l need Balat.

01:41:29.482 --> 01:41:35.546
He wrote to me to bid me farewell,
believing l was lost for ever to the inside.

01:41:35.655 --> 01:41:38.249
So committed his life to monastery!

01:41:38.324 --> 01:41:40.815
You will speak in your native tongue!

01:41:42.495 --> 01:41:45.896
This priest disguised you

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:48.134
as the most sacred of human beings.

01:41:48.334 --> 01:41:51.963
No, he did nothing!

01:41:55.508 --> 01:41:59.842
l disguised myself.

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:04.583
When l knew he could not recognize me,

01:42:04.884 --> 01:42:09.253
l became one of his brothers.

01:42:10.123 --> 01:42:15.060
He never knew l was a woman.

01:42:22.602 --> 01:42:26.538
My Lords, l speak the truth!

01:42:27.907 --> 01:42:31.866
He gave you this robe

01:42:34.714 --> 01:42:37.911
and you went to his bed!

01:42:38.818 --> 01:42:41.116
That is not true!

01:42:41.988 --> 01:42:45.287
And l condemn you

01:42:46.025 --> 01:42:49.756
for your foul thoughts

01:42:50.163 --> 01:42:51.892
and cruel hearts!

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.292
Cane her.

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:06.644
Stop it! Do you hear me?!

01:43:06.746 --> 01:43:09.214
Don't you dare lay
another hand on that woman!

01:43:10.383 --> 01:43:13.978
She has done nothing but to try
and find happiness! Do not touch me!

01:43:14.053 --> 01:43:17.250
l will go to the king!
He will put an end to this savagery!

01:43:26.933 --> 01:43:29.197
Thank you for seeing me, Your Majesty.

01:43:29.269 --> 01:43:32.670
l was told by your prime minister
this was none of my concern.

01:43:32.772 --> 01:43:34.831
lt is none of mem's concern.

01:43:34.941 --> 01:43:38.342
And king is seeing you now
to tell you same himself.

01:43:38.411 --> 01:43:39.810
Forgive me, but...

01:43:39.879 --> 01:43:44.782
l do not wish for you to talk more
on this, mem. To king or anyone.

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:47.445
- l was only trying...
- Tuptim broke law!

01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:50.785
By loving someone?
''Sacrifice your life for truth.''

01:43:50.857 --> 01:43:53.985
''Persecute no man.''
Are these not the teachings of Buddha?

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:56.722
l am king! And l say enough!

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:04.066
You asked me to always tell you what l think.

01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:07.799
What you think... and what you do

01:44:07.874 --> 01:44:10.900
and how... and when you do them

01:44:11.010 --> 01:44:13.069
are not the same thing.

01:44:14.013 --> 01:44:17.005
lf you believe l wish to execute this girl...

01:44:17.717 --> 01:44:21.278
But now, because you say to court

01:44:22.388 --> 01:44:25.221
you can tell king what to do,

01:44:25.291 --> 01:44:28.124
l cannot intervene as l had planned.

01:44:28.227 --> 01:44:30.388
lntervene? After they're tortured?

01:44:30.463 --> 01:44:31.930
Yes!

01:44:33.299 --> 01:44:37.599
But you, a woman and a foreigner,

01:44:38.938 --> 01:44:41.668
have made it seem king at your command.

01:44:41.808 --> 01:44:43.901
You have made me appear weak.

01:44:44.010 --> 01:44:47.810
And impossible for me
to step in and not lose face!

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.246
- But you are the king.
- To remain such,

01:44:50.316 --> 01:44:53.843
l cannot undermine ability
to command loyalty,

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:57.686
- which l must have to keep country secure.
- You have the power...

01:44:57.824 --> 01:45:01.419
Now is not the time to change
the way that things are done!

01:45:02.061 --> 01:45:04.120
Well, if not now, then when?

01:45:04.230 --> 01:45:07.961
How many more people must die
so that you might save face?!

01:45:17.844 --> 01:45:20.278
Go home, mem.

01:45:20.346 --> 01:45:22.439
You help enough for one day.

01:49:47.313 --> 01:49:51.807
For the life of me, l don't know
how you people can stand this heat.

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:54.751
You have five minutes, Mr Kincaid.

01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:57.015
l suggest you not waste them.

01:49:58.758 --> 01:50:01.625
l don't suppose l could have a glass ofwater?

01:50:05.731 --> 01:50:07.358
Right.

01:50:07.433 --> 01:50:09.833
Then l'll come straight to the point.

01:50:11.237 --> 01:50:17.233
As you know, l do a lot
of business with the Siamese,

01:50:17.343 --> 01:50:20.574
many ofwhom have ended up
dead in recent months.

01:50:20.646 --> 01:50:25.549
Which, as l have discovered,
is all part of some elaborate plot

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:28.746
to make you think we British are the villains.

01:50:31.457 --> 01:50:34.426
l happen to know we are not.

01:50:34.994 --> 01:50:41.558
The acquisition of a particular little piece
of information has cost me a small fortune.

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:44.501
But the fact is, when all is said and done,

01:50:44.603 --> 01:50:48.004
l make more money
with Mongkut on the throne, so

01:50:48.074 --> 01:50:53.307
l think l'm about to become your best friend.

01:50:55.281 --> 01:51:02.016
Your Majesty, Alak will not stop
until all ofyour children are in velvet sacks.

01:51:03.322 --> 01:51:07.383
Kincaid said he'll blame
the coup on Burma,

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:12.989
then launch a full-scale attack using
your troops already protecting the border.

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:17.397
Alak seeks to finish
what Taksin only dreamed of.

01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:19.529
Taksin was insane.

01:51:19.638 --> 01:51:21.435
No.

01:51:21.507 --> 01:51:23.600
He was betrayed.

01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:26.669
As we are now.

01:51:27.646 --> 01:51:30.114
How long before Alak reaches the city?

01:51:30.249 --> 01:51:31.944
A week.

01:51:32.051 --> 01:51:33.746
Maybe less.

01:51:33.853 --> 01:51:35.912
And my armies?

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:38.650
They will never reach the palace in time.

01:51:41.694 --> 01:51:43.753
Then he has already won.

01:51:45.664 --> 01:51:48.292
l will evacuate the royal family at once.

01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:06.117
No.

01:52:06.252 --> 01:52:08.311
Recall the army.

01:52:08.387 --> 01:52:10.480
And announce to the people

01:52:11.490 --> 01:52:14.755
we have just received glad tidings.

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:20.957
Glad tidings, Your Majesty?

01:52:32.178 --> 01:52:35.773
Mother, doesn't chahng see kao
mean white elephant?

01:52:35.881 --> 01:52:39.476
- Do you think they've found one?
- Yes. ln Prachin Buri.

01:52:39.552 --> 01:52:42.783
Entire village has seen it.
The first in 20 years!

01:52:42.888 --> 01:52:46.324
- l'll see to our tickets.
- l don't want to go, Mother.

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:48.690
l don't want to leave my friends.

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:52.720
- The king has done good things too.
- Your mother has much on her mind.

01:52:52.798 --> 01:52:55.289
You said the Siamese people are just like us.

01:52:55.367 --> 01:52:58.632
And what about Chulalongkorn?
Doesn't he matter any more?

01:53:01.574 --> 01:53:05.908
Believe me, darling.
l wish this could all be very different.

01:53:05.978 --> 01:53:08.037
lt is the right decision.

01:53:08.147 --> 01:53:09.944
We must go.

01:53:27.399 --> 01:53:29.060
Sir.

01:53:29.168 --> 01:53:35.596
You of all are most aware
there are certain boundaries l cannot cross.

01:53:35.674 --> 01:53:38.165
One being to contradict king.

01:53:38.244 --> 01:53:40.371
Yes. And God help him.

01:53:40.446 --> 01:53:41.743
Excuse me.

01:53:41.814 --> 01:53:44.783
Passage for four on the Newcastle.
Thank you.

01:53:44.850 --> 01:53:46.943
There is no white elephant, sir.

01:53:50.189 --> 01:53:53.090
King invented sighting at Prachin Buri

01:53:53.192 --> 01:53:58.027
so he can escort royal family
to greet imaginary beast, as in tradition.

01:53:58.097 --> 01:54:00.190
l don't understand.

01:54:04.503 --> 01:54:08.735
There is a traitor marching on palace.

01:54:09.775 --> 01:54:15.111
Deception's only purpose is to hide children
in monastery in village of Nong Khai.

01:54:16.448 --> 01:54:18.507
Please, mem.

01:54:18.617 --> 01:54:21.882
My king believes you are wise.

01:54:21.987 --> 01:54:25.923
You are only one who can persuade him
to stay with children

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:29.927
until army returns to Bangkok
and palace is secure.

01:54:32.631 --> 01:54:34.690
Please, mem.

01:54:44.710 --> 01:54:46.302
Everything in order, gentlemen?

01:54:46.378 --> 01:54:49.643
We have fireworks to announce the
sighting and musicians for the journey.

01:54:49.715 --> 01:54:51.842
Let us hope Alak is convinced.

01:55:54.546 --> 01:55:59.108
l have just been informed ofthe nature
of your expedition, Your Majesty.

01:55:59.184 --> 01:56:04.144
And l would like to ask a few questions
about the dangers involved

01:56:04.223 --> 01:56:06.885
as l've heard, at times,

01:56:06.959 --> 01:56:09.826
wild elephants cannot be reasoned with.

01:56:12.164 --> 01:56:16.294
l am surprised Kralahome
took time to arouse such curiosity

01:56:16.368 --> 01:56:19.337
rather than make sure
mem not miss her boat.

01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:25.972
We have already missed our boat
so that l might speak with you now.

01:56:26.045 --> 01:56:28.377
King cannot miss his boat.

01:56:28.514 --> 01:56:32.348
lf it will not be inconvenient,
we should like to go with you.

01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:35.512
Jungle is no place for proper English teacher.

01:56:35.587 --> 01:56:40.183
No, it is not, Your Majesty. Which is why
the presence of one in your cortege

01:56:40.259 --> 01:56:42.420
might help ensure your display.

01:56:47.199 --> 01:56:49.429
Something l feel,

01:56:49.568 --> 01:56:51.934
for many reasons,

01:56:52.004 --> 01:56:54.564
l would very much like to do.

01:57:57.469 --> 01:58:00.836
When a woman who has much to say
says nothing,

01:58:02.207 --> 01:58:04.471
her silence can be deafening.

01:58:10.716 --> 01:58:13.412
l wish to thank you, mem, for your courage.

01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:21.019
l thought l never wanted to see you again.

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:39.901
l had a vision ofyoung Tuptim and of Balat.

01:58:41.513 --> 01:58:44.880
l think by touching us all

01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:49.478
they have fulfilled their destiny
and attained eternal peace.

01:58:53.125 --> 01:58:57.892
Through birth and rebirth, we Buddhists
hope to learn from our mistakes.

01:59:02.968 --> 01:59:07.268
You told me once that l had never
accepted the loss of my husband.

01:59:07.339 --> 01:59:11.105
- l had no right.
- No, no. That was true.

01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:15.075
l now realize that
it is not enough to just survive.

01:59:16.482 --> 01:59:18.973
That life is... precious.

01:59:21.186 --> 01:59:25.145
Especially ifyou're Christian
and only allowed to have one.

01:59:29.761 --> 01:59:31.820
Why did you come back?

01:59:36.201 --> 01:59:39.227
Because l could not imagine
a Siam without you.

01:59:59.858 --> 02:00:03.157
The Royal Steamer
has been abandoned near Lopburi.

02:00:03.795 --> 02:00:07.060
The King travels East on foot,
away from Prachin Buri.

02:00:10.135 --> 02:00:12.763
lf he lies about a white elephant,

02:00:13.205 --> 02:00:16.834
what other scheme has he concealed?

02:00:18.143 --> 02:00:21.772
Are the children with him?

02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:23.615
Yes.

02:00:24.983 --> 02:00:27.577
Where would he take them?

02:00:34.026 --> 02:00:36.620
There is a monastery in Nong Khai...

02:00:38.964 --> 02:00:44.459
Mongkut spent half his life there.

02:00:45.837 --> 02:00:48.101
His sanctuary.

02:00:50.842 --> 02:00:55.438
The Chakri Dynasty comes to us.

02:00:56.048 --> 02:01:00.007
We must not keep them waiting.

02:02:07.686 --> 02:02:12.487
We cannot outrun them, Your Majesty.

02:02:28.774 --> 02:02:33.006
Do not let them see your fear, gentlemen.

02:02:38.183 --> 02:02:40.276
What has happened?

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:43.378
You and the children must
go on to Nong Khai without me.

02:02:43.488 --> 02:02:45.547
l will meet you there.

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:49.025
l can see it in your eyes.
Something awful has happened.

02:02:49.127 --> 02:02:51.186
Was not to be this way, mem.

02:02:53.432 --> 02:02:55.525
Alak's army has found us.

02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:57.693
lf he crosses the bridge,

02:02:58.937 --> 02:03:01.235
everything l love will die.

02:03:01.339 --> 02:03:03.933
- But they're only children.
- Yes.

02:03:04.643 --> 02:03:06.736
And each one heir to throne.

02:03:07.612 --> 02:03:09.773
Now... you must hurry.

02:03:11.183 --> 02:03:14.550
- What will you do?
- Blow up the bridge.

02:03:14.619 --> 02:03:16.712
But will that stop him?

02:03:16.788 --> 02:03:18.847
lt will - if he's on it.

02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:23.188
Your Majesty, promise me...
Promise me that l will see you again.

02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:36.004
lf your Bible is correct,
whole world created in seven days.

02:03:36.475 --> 02:03:38.739
Therefore

02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:41.608
possible handful of men can stop an army.

02:03:56.661 --> 02:04:01.098
But, Father, never has such
an expedition excluded royal children.

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:07.263
My son, there are many things you will
come to understand when you are older.

02:04:07.372 --> 02:04:09.101
Why can't l stay with you?

02:04:09.207 --> 02:04:12.438
Because l need you
to lead our family to the monastery!

02:04:17.582 --> 02:04:20.847
There is no white elephant, is there?

02:04:55.153 --> 02:04:57.713
Come. Come.

02:05:59.317 --> 02:06:00.978
No matter what happens...

02:06:01.353 --> 02:06:02.513
the moment you're ready

02:06:02.988 --> 02:06:04.717
blow this bridge.

02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:28.673
Throw down your weapons

02:07:28.907 --> 02:07:32.468
or you and your men will be slaughtered

02:07:32.777 --> 02:07:34.472
without mercy.

02:07:36.848 --> 02:07:39.646
l hardly think women and children

02:07:39.884 --> 02:07:43.911
with parasols are up to the task.

02:07:44.723 --> 02:07:49.683
l think you will find l have more on
my side than just women and children.

02:08:06.344 --> 02:08:08.312
lt's a trap, General.

02:08:38.443 --> 02:08:41.674
Mother, come look!
The king is waiting on the bridge.

02:08:41.746 --> 02:08:44.943
- What?
- There's hundreds of men on the other side.

02:08:57.262 --> 02:08:59.355
Wait! Stop the carriage.

02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:03.331
He's crazy.

02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:07.597
He's bluffing.

02:09:44.442 --> 02:09:47.411
...Defiant to the last.

02:09:47.846 --> 02:09:50.576
As the sun sets,

02:09:50.949 --> 02:09:54.578
so does the Chakri Dynasty.

02:10:11.603 --> 02:10:13.070
He's brought the British!?

02:10:13.471 --> 02:10:15.132
There is nobody! lt's a trick!

02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:17.173
lt's the British!

02:10:17.442 --> 02:10:19.205
Retreat!

02:10:19.944 --> 02:10:21.206
There is no one!

02:10:21.479 --> 02:10:22.468
lt's a trick!

02:10:39.297 --> 02:10:42.960
There is nobody! lt's a trick!

02:10:45.603 --> 02:10:47.571
lt's a trick.

02:11:00.018 --> 02:11:02.816
Let me kill him.

02:11:03.087 --> 02:11:04.054
No.

02:11:06.524 --> 02:11:11.484
l want him to live with his humiliation.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.695
You!

02:12:58.636 --> 02:13:02.299
Why did you not go to monastery
like king order?

02:13:04.108 --> 02:13:07.339
Because l lost one man to the jungle,
Your Majesty.

02:13:07.412 --> 02:13:10.381
l was not about to let that happen again.

02:13:10.481 --> 02:13:13.109
Mem Anna not fully to blame, Father.

02:13:13.184 --> 02:13:16.881
After all, you did put me in charge.

02:13:24.962 --> 02:13:29.194
To sound English bugles in own defense.

02:13:30.234 --> 02:13:32.327
Yes.

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:38.798
When king say handful of men
could save all Siam,

02:13:38.876 --> 02:13:41.936
he was most unusually

02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:45.039
incorrect.

02:13:51.422 --> 02:13:55.051
And it be then that all ears hear

02:13:56.394 --> 02:13:58.954
what all eyes suddenly see.

02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:01.590
Great white beast in infinite splendor!

02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:04.393
Where's the beast?

02:14:06.704 --> 02:14:09.366
Great white beast!

02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:18.708
And as people rejoice
with overwhelming joy,

02:14:30.461 --> 02:14:36.832
most excellent conclusion to expedition
echoed in every corner of Siam.

02:14:36.901 --> 02:14:38.528
The end!

02:14:50.314 --> 02:14:52.407
Perfect! You were wonderful!

02:14:52.483 --> 02:14:54.417
Very, very good.

02:14:54.485 --> 02:14:59.286
Mem, this is play to commemorate
monumental occasion

02:14:59.357 --> 02:15:03.760
and we make fools of selves
because of insufficient practice.

02:15:03.861 --> 02:15:08.127
l understand truly, Your Highness.
But the celebration was tonight!

02:15:08.232 --> 02:15:10.291
We were duty-bound, were we not?

02:15:10.368 --> 02:15:12.893
- Were we not?
- Yes!

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:18.307
l want you all to imagine next year,
when you've had time to perfect things.

02:15:18.376 --> 02:15:22.278
Then your father will be even more
proud ofyou than he already is.

02:15:23.848 --> 02:15:25.873
And you, mem?

02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:28.043
Will you be?

02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:39.488
l will always be proud ofyou, my children.

02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:06.617
l... ordered this some time ago
for the children, you know.

02:16:06.724 --> 02:16:09.784
lt's a fine example of scientific thinking,

02:16:10.795 --> 02:16:13.286
as music is mathematical in nature.

02:16:14.732 --> 02:16:18.532
Chords constructed from notes
in intervals ofthirds,

02:16:19.971 --> 02:16:23.065
and so on, and so on.

02:16:24.041 --> 02:16:26.305
Precisely.

02:16:34.317 --> 02:16:37.617
l would like to know... why,

02:16:38.923 --> 02:16:42.950
if science can unravel
something as beautiful as music,

02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:48.057
why it cannot posit a solution
for a schoolteacher and a king.

02:16:49.534 --> 02:16:53.834
The manner in which
people might understand

02:16:53.938 --> 02:16:57.066
such new possibilities is

02:16:57.174 --> 02:17:00.268
also process of evolution.

02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:05.046
Everything in Siam has its own time.

02:17:10.754 --> 02:17:13.781
Even if king is also wanting it to be different.

02:17:17.227 --> 02:17:19.287
l still must go, Your Majesty.

02:17:27.905 --> 02:17:29.395
So,

02:17:29.473 --> 02:17:31.566
where is it you will be going?

02:17:34.011 --> 02:17:36.070
England.

02:17:38.249 --> 02:17:40.308
Home.

02:17:42.386 --> 02:17:44.445
This is good, mem.

02:17:44.522 --> 02:17:47.047
Very good for Louis as well.

02:17:58.936 --> 02:18:01.029
What?

02:18:03.341 --> 02:18:05.433
Am wondering if,

02:18:06.209 --> 02:18:08.269
given circumstances,

02:18:09.814 --> 02:18:12.281
it is appropriate

02:18:13.117 --> 02:18:15.209
for king to ask

02:18:16.353 --> 02:18:18.481
Anna

02:18:18.556 --> 02:18:20.648
to dance.

02:18:25.262 --> 02:18:28.288
l have danced with a king before,
Your Majesty.

02:18:34.171 --> 02:18:36.263
And l

02:18:39.309 --> 02:18:41.369
an Englishwoman.

02:19:09.206 --> 02:19:11.299
Until now,

02:19:12.910 --> 02:19:15.003
Madam Leonowens,

02:19:16.414 --> 02:19:18.974
l did not understand supposition

02:19:20.017 --> 02:19:24.386
man could be satisfied
with only one woman.

02:20:14.872 --> 02:20:17.602
l was onlya boy,

02:20:17.675 --> 02:20:22.476
but the image ofmyfatherholding
the woman he lovedfor the last time

02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:25.549
has remained with me throughout the years.

02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:31.817
lt is always surprising howsmalla part oflife
is taken up bymeaningfulmoments.

02:20:33.758 --> 02:20:36.989
Most often theyare overbefore theystart,

02:20:37.094 --> 02:20:40.586
although they casta light on the future

02:20:40.664 --> 02:20:44.464
and make the person
who originated them unforgettable.

02:20:46.170 --> 02:20:50.573
Anna hadshinedsuch a light on Siam.
