WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:04.003
You don't want to go
in there. It stinks.

00:09.508 --> 00:12.511
My, my, my.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.513
Aren't you
my little songbirds

00:14.548 --> 00:17.016
from the cafeteria?

00:17.516 --> 00:19.518
Weren't they with you?

00:19.553 --> 00:21.520
Who, these guys?

00:21.555 --> 00:25.524
I'm sure you've learned
the school song by now.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.526
You better know it

00:27.561 --> 00:28.527
because this time

00:29.028 --> 00:31.030
if you don't
get it right,

00:31.065 --> 00:33.532
you're suspended
for 10 days each.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.034
Is that clear?

00:35.069 --> 00:36.535
Yes, sir.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.537
All right,
let me hear it.

00:39.038 --> 00:42.041
All right, fellas,
let him hear it.

00:43.542 --> 00:45.544
Fair eastside

00:51.050 --> 00:54.053
fair eastsl-l-ide

00:57.556 --> 01:01.060
fair eastside

01:10.069 --> 01:13.072

01:13.107 --> 01:15.574

01:15.609 --> 01:20.079

and hands

01:20.114 --> 01:25.084

thy fame

01:25.119 --> 01:27.586
ooh, lord

01:27.621 --> 01:30.589
the honor, yeah

01:30.624 --> 01:34.593
of old eastside high

01:34.628 --> 01:39.098

our loyalty

01:39.133 --> 01:42.101
loyalty, loyalty

01:42.136 --> 01:43.602
so cheer-

01:43.637 --> 01:45.604
all right,
all right!

01:45.639 --> 01:47.606
Who taught you that?

01:49.108 --> 01:50.609
Answer me!

01:50.644 --> 01:53.112
I know you didn't
do it yourselves.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.114
Sams!

01:55.149 --> 01:57.116
What?

01:57.151 --> 01:59.618
Who taught you this song?

01:59.653 --> 02:00.619
Speak up!

02:00.654 --> 02:02.621
Mrs. Powers.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.124
Mrs. Powers, eh?

02:05.159 --> 02:08.127
Come with me, all of you.

02:10.628 --> 02:11.630
...out this world

02:12.131 --> 02:13.632
gonna shoulder up
my cross

02:13.667 --> 02:15.134
gonna take it home
to my jesus

02:15.169 --> 02:17.136
ain't that good news?

02:17.171 --> 02:18.637
I got a savior
in that kingdom

02:18.672 --> 02:20.639
ain't that good news?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.141
I got a savior
in that kingdom

02:22.641 --> 02:25.144
ain't that good news?

02:25.179 --> 02:26.645
No, no, no, people.

02:27.146 --> 02:28.647
You must remember,

02:28.682 --> 02:32.651
we need intonation,
phonation, accuracy, and pitch.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.653
Now, this is your note.

02:35.154 --> 02:36.655
Hmm

02:36.690 --> 02:38.157
mrs. Powers.

02:38.657 --> 02:39.658
Yes, sir.

02:40.159 --> 02:41.660
These hoodlums
told me something.

02:42.161 --> 02:44.163
Did you change
the school song?

02:44.663 --> 02:46.165
Mrs. Powers-

02:46.200 --> 02:47.666
let her answer!

02:48.167 --> 02:50.669
The children thought
the song was boring.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.171
Boring, huh?

02:52.671 --> 02:54.673
I have
never heard

02:54.708 --> 02:55.674
a school song
like that.

02:56.175 --> 02:59.178
I didn't authorize
you to change it,

02:59.678 --> 03:01.180
did i?

03:01.215 --> 03:03.682
No, you didn't.

03:06.685 --> 03:09.688
I want everyone
to learn that song

03:09.723 --> 03:12.691
in english and spanish.
Immediately.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.693
Take a bow,
mrs. Powers.

03:14.728 --> 03:18.197
You've rewritten
our alma mater.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.699
The honor

03:21.200 --> 03:23.702
of old eastside high

03:23.737 --> 03:26.705
brings forth
our loyalty

03:26.740 --> 03:29.208
loyalty, loyalty

03:29.243 --> 03:35.214
so cheer for dear
old eastside...

03:35.249 --> 03:37.716
how's it going?

03:37.751 --> 03:40.219
What you got
in there, malachi?

03:40.254 --> 03:41.720
My future.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.222
All right.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.224
...aboard eastside

03:45.259 --> 03:47.726
all aboard, all aboard

03:47.761 --> 03:50.229
yes, eastside

03:50.264 --> 03:52.731
all aboard, all aboard

03:52.766 --> 03:54.733
how's it going,
mr. Darnell?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.735
Good, good.
That's great.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.237
...high

03:58.272 --> 04:01.240
ge-e-et

04:01.275 --> 04:02.741
fellas?

04:02.776 --> 04:06.745
On

04:06.780 --> 04:08.247
that

04:08.282 --> 04:10.249
train
train

04:10.284 --> 04:11.750
train

04:11.785 --> 04:13.252
ms. Levias...

04:13.287 --> 04:15.254
hi, mr. Clark.

04:15.289 --> 04:18.257
I just heard something
you wouldn't believe.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.259
Uh, mr. Clark,

04:20.293 --> 04:23.762
mr. O'malley just brought
this from trenton.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.768
The school's
practice test.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.282 --> 04:45.284
I had to wait
all this time for this?

04:45.319 --> 04:47.786
Next time i order you
to go get something,

04:47.821 --> 04:51.290
you better damn well
go get it yourself!

04:53.792 --> 04:56.428
Oh, no.
Oh, my god.

04:58.430 --> 05:00.933
Give me your
attention, everyone.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.936
First three rows
take 4 steps forward.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.938
Right now! Come on!

05:05.973 --> 05:08.440
1, 2, 3, 4.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.443
Ok, that's good.
Turn around.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.445
Hold it,
mr. O'malley!

05:13.480 --> 05:14.947
What's
your excuse?

05:14.982 --> 05:18.450
I was filling out
a big stack of forms.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.452
I didn't know
what time it was.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.454
This is a prime example

05:22.489 --> 05:25.457
of the kind of
inefficiency and apathy

05:25.492 --> 05:27.960
that is destroying
this school.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.963
Mr. O'malley, i can't
believe you're that bad.

05:30.998 --> 05:34.466
I'll give you a chance
to revitalize your image.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.969
Set up a student-peer
tutoring program.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.471
Maybe the students
can help themselves.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.474
Lord knows, you teachers
aren't doing the job.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.477
Ms. Levias, i want
remedial reading on saturdays.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.479
Volunteers will get
regular pay.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.481
We can't afford
overtime.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.484
Mr. Clark, the problem
isn't our pay.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.486
What is the problem
as you see it?

05:54.521 --> 05:57.990
How to get the students
in on saturday.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.992
You hear that, people?

06:00.027 --> 06:03.495
How do we get the students
in on saturdays

06:03.530 --> 06:04.997
for remedial reading?

06:05.032 --> 06:05.998
I'll tell you how.

06:06.498 --> 06:08.500
We'll go to their homes.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.502
We'll talk to their folks.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.504
If their folks
can't read,

06:12.539 --> 06:15.507
they can come in, too.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.510
The only way
we'll get anything done

06:18.545 --> 06:21.013
is to get everyone
involved.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.016
And that goes
for all of you!

06:24.051 --> 06:26.018
It's time
to get involved.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.022
Everyone in this section,

06:30.057 --> 06:32.524
put both your hands
above your heads.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.526
Raise your hands!

06:34.561 --> 06:36.528
Put them up!

06:43.035 --> 06:46.038
You people represent
the 70% of our students

06:46.073 --> 06:48.540
who just failed
the practice exam.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.543
70%!

06:51.578 --> 06:54.546
But that is not
their failure.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.050
I don't blame them.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.552
The failure is yours.

07:01.053 --> 07:04.556
That's right, yours.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.060
How many hours do you spend
preparing your lesson plans?

07:08.095 --> 07:11.063
How often do you
stay after school

07:11.098 --> 07:13.065
to give those children-

07:13.100 --> 07:15.567
the ones
you know need it-

07:15.602 --> 07:18.070
the extra help
that they require?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.572
Keep your hands up.

07:20.607 --> 07:25.077
Now you're getting a hint
of the hopelessness and shame

07:25.112 --> 07:27.079
that makes those
failing students

07:27.114 --> 07:29.081
throw up their hands

07:29.116 --> 07:32.084
at the thought
of facing a world

07:32.119 --> 07:34.586
for which you have not
prepared them.

07:34.621 --> 07:38.590
You're getting an inkling
of the despair they feel

07:38.625 --> 07:41.593
when left to the mercy
of the streets.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.595
Keep your hands up high.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.597
Look around
at yourselves.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.599
Turn and look
at yourselves!

07:52.104 --> 07:56.108
Because you are failing
to educate them,

07:56.143 --> 07:59.611
this is the posture
our students will wind up in,

07:59.646 --> 08:03.115
only they'll be staring
down the barrel of a gun!

08:10.822 --> 08:15.327
Ooh, yeah, yeah

08:15.362 --> 08:16.828
ahh ha ha

08:26.838 --> 08:28.840
if a man is born
in luxury

08:28.875 --> 08:32.344
it proves to me
through history

08:32.379 --> 08:35.347
he is somebody

08:35.381 --> 08:37.349
if a man is born
in poverty

08:37.384 --> 08:40.852
privation and misery

08:40.886 --> 08:43.855
he is nobody

08:43.890 --> 08:47.359
everybody is somebody

08:47.394 --> 08:51.863
nobody is nobody

08:51.898 --> 08:54.866
i mean, apart
from all the wealthy

08:55.367 --> 08:56.368
ooh

08:56.403 --> 08:59.371
everybody is somebody

08:59.871 --> 09:02.874
oh, yeah

09:02.909 --> 09:04.876
so look at me here, man?

09:05.377 --> 09:08.380
Ooh ooh ooh

09:08.415 --> 09:09.881
oh, yeah

09:09.916 --> 09:13.885
ooh ooh ooh

09:13.920 --> 09:15.387
poverty is what,
what it takes

09:15.422 --> 09:19.391
it makes such dangerous
mistakes about who

09:19.426 --> 09:21.893
who is somebody

09:21.928 --> 09:23.895
when a woman
has a child

09:23.930 --> 09:26.398
before that child
is born

09:26.433 --> 09:30.402
she, she is somebody

09:30.437 --> 09:34.406
everybody is somebody

09:34.441 --> 09:38.910
nobody is nobody

09:38.945 --> 09:41.913
i mean, apart
from all the wealthy

09:42.414 --> 09:43.415
doo doo doo doo doo

09:43.915 --> 09:50.422
everybody is somebody

09:50.457 --> 09:52.924
yeah, oh, yeah

09:55.927 --> 10:00.932
everybody is somebody

10:21.453 --> 10:23.955
all right, you guys,
forget it.

10:24.456 --> 10:25.957
All right, i got one.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.459
Who's this?

10:27.494 --> 10:30.462
People, move to the right
of the halls.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.464
Move expeditiously.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.466
Francesca,
come over here.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.967
How are you?

10:36.002 --> 10:37.469
Fine, mr. Clark.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.970
How's your sister?

10:39.005 --> 10:40.972
She broke her leg.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.474
That's good.

10:42.509 --> 10:45.477
You have any problem,
come to my office.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.978
Here's the key.

10:47.013 --> 10:48.980
Ooh, that
ain't the key.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.982
Sams, sams.
Where's sams?

10:51.017 --> 10:52.984
Anybody see sams?

10:53.019 --> 10:55.487
Pull your pants up, son.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.988
Clarence, come here.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.490
Get your hormones
under control, boy.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.991
Let me feel your butt.

11:00.026 --> 11:00.992
Joe: Clarence.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.495
What do you think
you're doing?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.497
I was just...

11:05.532 --> 11:07.499
i was just, um...

11:07.534 --> 11:10.001
francesca,
come here.

11:10.502 --> 11:12.003
What is he doing?
Can he do me?

11:12.038 --> 11:14.005
Does he have
the juice?

11:14.040 --> 11:15.006
No way, mr. Clark.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.008
Clarence, report
to my office.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.511
Mr. Clark, i was
just fooling around.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.513
Got you.

11:23.515 --> 11:26.518
How do you learn the alphabet
? be on time

11:26.553 --> 11:29.521
come on, sams!
You can do it.

11:29.556 --> 11:30.522
...he's on time

11:31.022 --> 11:33.525
j-o-e c-l-a...

11:33.560 --> 11:35.026
don't give up!

11:35.061 --> 11:36.528
Fall in together,

11:36.563 --> 11:37.529
going "how do you like
the weather?"

11:37.564 --> 11:38.530
Going "how do you
learn the alphabet?"

11:38.565 --> 11:40.031
Be on time

11:40.066 --> 11:43.034
school bell ring
at a quarter to 9:00

11:43.069 --> 11:46.037
that's it, sams!
Stay with it, boy!

11:46.072 --> 11:47.539
...be on time

11:47.574 --> 11:49.541
"how do you learn
the alphabet?" be on time

11:50.041 --> 11:52.043
how do you spell eastside
, eastside high?

11:52.078 --> 11:54.546
How do you spell joe clark?
He's on time

11:54.581 --> 11:57.048
j-o-e c-l...

11:57.083 --> 11:59.551
holy cow!
I'm out of here.

12:02.087 --> 12:04.556
Clark can't even get them
past that test.

12:05.056 --> 12:07.559
I thought we'd
settled this.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.562
With the doors chained,
that school's a firetrap.

12:11.062 --> 12:12.564
He's laughing at us.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.065
The man has
a legitimate problem.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.568
How does he keep drug pushers
out of his school

12:16.603 --> 12:19.571
if their buddies
can let them walk on in?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.573
He's got a point.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.075
This doesn't
concern you.

12:24.110 --> 12:27.078
Don, we can both
go to jail.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.581
By statute, we are
legally responsible.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.584
If a fire broke out
and a kid got hurt,

12:33.084 --> 12:34.586
they're going to
get trampled.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.589
A bunch
of savages anyway.

12:37.624 --> 12:38.590
Savages?

12:38.625 --> 12:41.593
Don, can't you
control your men?

12:41.628 --> 12:43.094
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:43.595 --> 12:46.097
please leave me alone
with mrs. Barrett.

12:46.132 --> 12:49.601
Don, i want to
talk to you.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.103
I'll call you later
at your office.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.607
Thank you, frank.
Close the door, eh?

13:00.111 --> 13:04.616
I want to apologize for
the chief's use of language.

13:05.116 --> 13:08.119
I don't like
none of you people.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.121
Then let's cut through
the formalities.

13:10.622 --> 13:11.623
What do you want?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.124
Clark!

13:13.159 --> 13:16.127
Just like that.
Head on a platter.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.630
You think
i got an attitude.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.633
Let me tell you
what i think.

13:21.668 --> 13:24.636
You like clark
because he's a guard dog,

13:24.671 --> 13:27.138
does your dirty work,
keeps the black folk in line.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.140
That's fine, but you got
to get re-elected.

13:29.175 --> 13:32.143
I got enough folks
lined up with me

13:32.178 --> 13:36.147
to give you a damn hard time,
and i'll get more.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.649
Unless i do what?

13:38.149 --> 13:40.151
Appoint me
to the school board

13:40.652 --> 13:43.154
so we can
vote clark out.

13:43.189 --> 13:46.157
Otherwise we'll have to
vote you out.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.660
It's always a pleasure
to see citizens

13:48.695 --> 13:51.162
avail themselves of
the democratic process.

13:51.197 --> 13:53.164
My job will be easy.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.167
You're not too popular
these days, are you?

13:58.169 --> 14:01.172
I'll sic the fire chief
on clark.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.174
Will that satisfy you?

14:03.209 --> 14:07.178
Yes. And then i'll get
the school board to dismiss him.

14:07.679 --> 14:09.681
Then you'll come out
publicly for me.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.684
It'll be my pleasure,
mr. Mayor.

14:16.222 --> 14:19.190
That barrett
is a bitch on wheels.

14:19.225 --> 14:22.193
Smart. She's smart.

14:22.228 --> 14:26.197
Yeah. She got
your number.

14:26.232 --> 14:29.200
When am i supposed
to do this?

14:40.712 --> 14:43.214
Now we'd just
disrupt things.

14:43.249 --> 14:47.218
Give him another week
to prepare for that test.

14:47.253 --> 14:51.723
Then we'll catch him
with chains on the doors.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.224
We nail him,

14:53.259 --> 14:55.727
and we make her
happy.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.229
Politics.
What a business.

14:58.264 --> 15:02.734
It's just like yours,
putting out fires.

15:14.579 --> 15:17.082
The mayor's going to
nail me, huh?

15:17.117 --> 15:19.084
What do i
always say?

15:19.119 --> 15:21.086
He's got the hammer
and nails himself.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.087
These are some
of my white students.

15:22.587 --> 15:25.590
Frankie, bernard,
steve.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.593
Boys, this is mr. Rosenberg,
school attorney.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.597
Let him hear
the school song.

15:34.599 --> 15:37.602
Fair eastside

15:37.637 --> 15:39.604
by thy side
by thy side?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.106
We'll stand
we'll stand?

15:41.141 --> 15:44.609
And always
praise thy name-

15:44.644 --> 15:46.111
all right!

15:46.146 --> 15:48.613
I can't stand this.
Needs work, fellas.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.115
Some things
you can't teach.

15:50.615 --> 15:52.117
Bad singing
isn't genetic.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.618
How's your mother?

15:54.119 --> 15:57.122
She got that job.
She's feeling good.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.124
Girls,
what are you doing?

15:59.159 --> 16:02.127
The phone's broken.
My baby's sick.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.629
Make your call
from the office.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.631
When will you girls
learn?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.133
I ain't ashamed
about my baby.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.634
Nobody's saying
you should be ashamed.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.636
And she ain't
ashamed of me.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.638
Whenever
she look at me,

16:13.673 --> 16:15.140
she don't see
no wrong.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.143
Ok. Go on and make
your call.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.645
Mr. Vanzetti,
let these girls make a call.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.647
Hey, mr. Clark.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.151
We can't let them know
who told you.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.654
Why not?

16:29.689 --> 16:32.157
Mr. Clark,
we got a problem.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.659
How come
you leave us out?

16:34.694 --> 16:36.661
Everything's
for the black kids.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.663
The gospel chorus,
football, basketball

16:38.698 --> 16:40.665
is for the blacks.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.168
I'm short. I can't
play basketball.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.170
The point is,
you're ignoring us.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.171
We're getting
really ticked off.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.672
With a mouth
like yours,

16:47.707 --> 16:49.674
you ought to
study law.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.675
Really?

16:50.710 --> 16:53.678
You kids wait for me
in my office.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.181
If you all talk
at once,

16:56.216 --> 16:57.682
i can't do anything.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.685
I'll be with you ladies
in a minute.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.688
Boss, you and mr. Rosenberg
better wait out here.

17:03.723 --> 17:07.192
Miss lynn,
give markus a pass.

17:08.693 --> 17:10.694
Ms. Levias,
is everyone here?

17:10.730 --> 17:12.196
Yes, sir.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.199
Let me have
your attention.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.701
With the help of my ubiquitous,
clandestine informants

17:16.736 --> 17:19.204
i have learned that the mayor
has told the fire chief

17:19.239 --> 17:21.705
to catch me
with chains on the doors.

17:21.741 --> 17:25.710
They want to prosecute me
and get me out of here.

17:25.744 --> 17:28.713
The security guards are
our first line of defense.

17:28.748 --> 17:33.218
If you see the fire chief,
stop him at the gates.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.221
Call in code 10
on your walkie-talkies.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.724
We will repeat code 10
on the p.a. System.

17:39.759 --> 17:43.228
All teachers and guards
have keys to the exit doors.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.230
When you hear code 10,

17:45.265 --> 17:50.235
proceed to your assigned door
and remove the chains.

17:50.735 --> 17:53.738
Guards, resume your posts.
Ms. Levias, take over.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.242
Tell those kids in my office
to meet me here 7th period.

17:57.742 --> 17:59.244
How did it go?

17:59.744 --> 18:01.746
It's under control.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.748
I have
the progress report

18:03.783 --> 18:05.750
on the reading
program.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.753
I thought you'd
like to hear it.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.255
I would like to hear it.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.758
I'd also like to hear
the kids in my office,

18:13.793 --> 18:15.260
and mr. Rosenberg,
and dr. Napier.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.262
I can't be 10 different
places at the same time.

18:17.297 --> 18:21.766
Maybe my vice principal can do
something without me for once.

18:23.768 --> 18:25.770
Mr. Clark.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.772
I'll help you
7th period.

18:31.776 --> 18:34.779
Excuse me.

18:43.955 --> 18:45.456
Good night,
mr. Clark.

18:45.957 --> 18:47.458
Good night.

18:49.961 --> 18:51.462
Mr. Clark.

18:51.963 --> 18:53.464
Yes, ms. Levias.

18:53.965 --> 18:57.468
May i talk to you
for a minute, please?

18:57.503 --> 18:58.970
What do you want?

18:59.005 --> 19:00.972
I want you
to transfer me.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.473
To where?

19:02.508 --> 19:03.975
Out of here.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.476
This doesn't
surprise me.

19:05.511 --> 19:09.480
I've sensed resistance in you
since our very first meeting.

19:09.515 --> 19:12.483
You're an egomaniacal
windbag.

19:12.518 --> 19:13.985
Who you talking to?
You!

19:14.020 --> 19:16.988
You like to whip people
who can't fight back.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.990
I thought i could take it
because i had a father

19:19.490 --> 19:20.491
in the same kind of pain

19:20.526 --> 19:21.492
that makes you
such a bastard,

19:21.527 --> 19:22.493
but i was wrong.
Life is much too short.

19:22.528 --> 19:26.497
I will not endure you
any longer.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.000
The only reason
i haven't walked out

19:29.035 --> 19:31.502
and half the staff
with me

19:31.537 --> 19:34.005
is because
those children need us.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.007
You're so busy
talking discipline,

19:36.042 --> 19:37.508
you forget to educate.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.511
What the hell do you think
i've been doing here?

19:40.546 --> 19:43.514
You cleaned it up.
That was easy.

19:43.549 --> 19:46.017
Those children
want to be helped.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.518
They've done everything
we've asked,

19:47.553 --> 19:49.020
but i feel
sorry for them.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.022
They're not ready
to take that test.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.524
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:53.559 --> 19:55.526
I have done everything-

19:55.561 --> 19:57.528
i. It is always i.

19:57.563 --> 20:00.031
There are 300
teachers here.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.532
You don't
do it alone.

20:01.567 --> 20:05.036
I don't have to listen
to these accusations.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.038
Youwilllisten!

20:07.073 --> 20:10.541
All right, ms. Levias,
go ahead and talk.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.043
You've been flapping
your mouth,

20:12.078 --> 20:13.544
and you haven't
heard a thing.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.046
You haven't seen what's
painfully obvious.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.548
I'll tell you what-

20:17.583 --> 20:19.550
no, let me finish!

20:19.585 --> 20:22.553
Everybody here
may not like you,

20:22.588 --> 20:25.056
but we all applaud
your effort.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.058
What you don't
understand

20:27.093 --> 20:30.061
is the same people
who support you

20:30.561 --> 20:32.563
are the ones
you're beating up!

20:32.598 --> 20:35.066
You don't even
say thank you.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.068
You just constantly
abuse them,

20:37.103 --> 20:38.569
criticize them.

20:38.604 --> 20:42.073
What the hell
do you want from me?

20:42.108 --> 20:45.076
I want you
to get this straight.

20:45.111 --> 20:48.579
Most of the teachers are
here because they care

20:48.614 --> 20:51.082
about those children,
this school, this fight.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.584
They're in it with you.

20:53.619 --> 20:54.585
They take it home
the same as you.

20:55.086 --> 20:56.587
They are part of those
children's lives.

20:56.622 --> 20:59.590
You are thoughtless
and cruel,

20:59.625 --> 21:01.092
and it hurts.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.594
And none of them
deserve it.

21:04.095 --> 21:07.098
They are sick of it,
and so am i.

21:30.621 --> 21:31.622
Ms. Levias.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.124
What's this?

21:33.159 --> 21:35.126
The transfer
you asked for.

21:48.139 --> 21:50.641
All right, people.
Here we are.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.143
This is the day.

21:52.643 --> 21:53.644
In one hour,

21:54.145 --> 21:57.648
you're going to take an exam
administered by the state

21:58.149 --> 21:59.650
to test your basic skills

22:00.151 --> 22:02.653
and the quality of education
at eastside high.

22:03.154 --> 22:05.656
And i want to tell you

22:05.691 --> 22:08.659
what the people out there
are saying about you

22:08.694 --> 22:10.661
and what they think
about your chances.

22:10.696 --> 22:12.663
They say you are inferior.

22:13.164 --> 22:13.664
Come on!

22:14.165 --> 22:15.166
Come on!

22:15.666 --> 22:17.168
Come on! Come on!

22:18.669 --> 22:23.674
"You are just a bunch of niggers
and spics and poor white trash."

22:24.710 --> 22:27.678
"Education is wasted on you."

22:29.180 --> 22:31.182
"You cannot learn!"

22:32.218 --> 22:34.185
You're lost!

22:36.187 --> 22:38.189
I mean all of you.

22:38.224 --> 22:41.692
I want all the white students
to stand up.

22:41.727 --> 22:44.195
All my white students,
stand up.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.696
Come on.

22:45.731 --> 22:47.698
Stand up.
Stand up.

22:47.733 --> 22:50.201
That's it.
Come on, stand up.

22:50.701 --> 22:53.204
These are my white children,

22:53.239 --> 22:56.207
and they're the same
as all of you.

22:56.242 --> 22:58.209
They've got no place to go.

22:58.244 --> 23:02.213
Otherwise, they would have
abandoned us a long time ago,

23:02.248 --> 23:04.715
but they couldn't.

23:04.750 --> 23:08.719
So here they are at eastside,
just like the rest of us.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.721
You can sit down.

23:10.756 --> 23:13.224
Are you getting my point,
people?

23:13.259 --> 23:14.225
Yes!

23:14.260 --> 23:15.726
Is it sinking in?

23:16.227 --> 23:17.228
Yes!

23:17.263 --> 23:19.730
We sink, we swim.

23:20.231 --> 23:21.732
We rise, we fall.

23:22.233 --> 23:24.235
We meet our fate together!

23:28.739 --> 23:35.246
Now, it took the help
of a good, good friend

23:35.281 --> 23:38.249
to make me know
and understand that,

23:38.749 --> 23:41.252
and i do understand it,
and i'm grateful.

23:41.752 --> 23:43.754
I'm eternally grateful.

23:46.757 --> 23:50.261
And i've got a message
for those people out there

23:50.761 --> 23:53.264
who've abandoned you
and written you off.

23:53.764 --> 23:55.766
Can you hear me?

23:55.801 --> 23:56.767
Yes!

23:56.802 --> 23:58.269
Can you hear me?

23:58.304 --> 23:59.770
Yes!

23:59.805 --> 24:00.771
Good!

24:01.272 --> 24:03.274
You are not inferior!

24:07.778 --> 24:09.780
Your grades may be.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.782
Your school may have been.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.285
But you can turn that around

24:14.320 --> 24:17.288
and make liars
out of those bastards

24:17.323 --> 24:18.789
in exactly one hour!

24:18.824 --> 24:22.293
You'll take that test,
pass it, and win!

24:29.300 --> 24:32.303
So here's what
i want you to do.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.307
When you find
your minds wandering,

24:36.342 --> 24:39.810
i want you to knuckle back down
and concentrate.

24:39.845 --> 24:42.313
Concentrate!

24:42.348 --> 24:43.814
Remember what's at stake

24:43.849 --> 24:47.318
and show them what eastside high
is all about-

24:47.353 --> 24:50.321
a spirit that will not die!

25:07.888 --> 25:12.893
Sometimes in our lives

25:12.928 --> 25:15.396
we all have pain

25:15.431 --> 25:20.401
we all have sorrow

25:20.436 --> 25:24.405
but if we are wise

25:24.440 --> 25:30.911
we know that there's
always tomorrow

25:30.946 --> 25:32.913
lean on me

25:32.948 --> 25:35.416
when you're not strong

25:35.916 --> 25:38.419
and i'll be your friend?

25:38.454 --> 25:42.923
I'll help you carry on

25:42.958 --> 25:46.427
for it won't be long

25:46.927 --> 25:49.430
till i'm gonna need

25:49.930 --> 25:53.434
somebody to lean on

25:53.469 --> 25:55.936
you just call
on me, brother

25:55.971 --> 25:58.439
when you need a hand

25:58.939 --> 26:03.944
we all need somebody
to lean on

26:03.979 --> 26:06.947
i just might have a problem?

26:06.982 --> 26:08.949
That you'll understand

26:09.450 --> 26:13.454
we all need somebody
to lean on

26:13.489 --> 26:16.457
why don't you
lean on me?

26:16.492 --> 26:18.959
Lean on me

26:18.994 --> 26:20.961
if you need a friend

26:20.996 --> 26:23.964
you can lean on me

26:23.999 --> 26:25.966
i'll be your friend

26:26.001 --> 26:26.967
lean on me

26:27.002 --> 26:28.969
you can lean on me

26:29.004 --> 26:30.471
come on
and lean on me

26:30.971 --> 26:31.472
lean on me

26:31.972 --> 26:34.475
you can lean on me

26:34.510 --> 26:38.979
please, won't you
swallow your pride?

26:39.014 --> 26:41.482
If i have things

26:41.517 --> 26:45.486
you need to borrow

26:45.521 --> 26:51.992
for no one can fill
those of your needs

26:52.027 --> 26:54.495
that you won't let go

26:54.530 --> 26:56.997
why don't you
just lean on?

26:57.032 --> 26:57.998
Anytime

26:58.499 --> 27:00.000
lean on

27:00.035 --> 27:01.001
come on and lean on

27:01.036 --> 27:04.004
lean on me,
you can lean on me

27:04.039 --> 27:06.006
if you need a friend

27:06.041 --> 27:07.007
lean on me

27:07.508 --> 27:09.009
you can lean on me

27:09.044 --> 27:11.512
and if you got a problem

27:11.547 --> 27:14.515
you can lean on me

27:14.550 --> 27:17.017
i'm your problem solver?

27:17.052 --> 27:19.019
You can lean on me

27:19.054 --> 27:20.521
why don't you lean?

27:20.556 --> 27:21.522
Lean on me

27:21.557 --> 27:24.024
uh-huh

27:24.059 --> 27:26.527
come on and lean on me

27:26.562 --> 27:28.529
you can lean on me

27:28.564 --> 27:30.531
call on me, brother

27:30.566 --> 27:32.032
you can lean on me

27:32.067 --> 27:35.035
sister, give me your hand

27:35.070 --> 27:38.038
lean on me,
you can lean on me

27:38.073 --> 27:39.540
you can, you can, you can

27:39.575 --> 27:42.543
lean on me,
you can lean on me

27:43.043 --> 27:44.044
swallow up your pride

27:44.545 --> 27:47.548
lean on me,
you can lean on...

27:47.583 --> 27:51.552
please, children, people

27:51.587 --> 27:57.558
lean on me, oh

28:06.066 --> 28:07.067
eastside!

28:07.102 --> 28:08.569
Eastside! Eastside!

28:09.069 --> 28:12.072
Eastside! Eastside!
Eastside!

28:12.573 --> 28:14.074
Eastside! Eastside!
Eastside!

28:14.575 --> 28:17.528
Eastside! Eastside! Eastside!
Eastside...

28:33.544 --> 28:37.047
dum dum-dum-dum-dum

28:37.082 --> 28:39.550
dum-dum-dum-dum

28:39.585 --> 28:43.053
dum-dum-dum dum-dum

28:43.554 --> 28:45.055
dum-dum

28:45.090 --> 28:48.058
sometimes in our lives

28:48.093 --> 28:50.561
we all have pain

28:51.061 --> 28:54.565
we all have sorrow

28:54.600 --> 28:55.566
dum-dum-dum

28:55.601 --> 28:59.069
but if we are wise

28:59.104 --> 29:05.576
we know that there's
always tomorrow

29:05.943 --> 29:07.411
i told you
these things take time.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.414
Just how long
am i supposed to wait?

29:10.449 --> 29:13.417
You boys are messing
with the wrong female.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.419
He won't
let me in.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.921
What's
going on?

29:16.956 --> 29:18.923
Would you
talk to her?

29:18.958 --> 29:21.926
I thought
we had made a deal.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.428
Don't broadcast it
all over town.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.931
I have got a school board
meeting tonight

29:27.431 --> 29:29.433
and enough votes
to get clark kicked out

29:29.468 --> 29:30.935
if i can prove
he's chained those doors.

29:30.970 --> 29:34.939
We can get that
if you move on him today.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.440
Chief gaines
already tried that.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.943
Bullshit! I've made
promises of my own.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.444
I've got people
with me right now.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.446
If i can't deliver-

29:42.481 --> 29:43.948
just a minute.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.951
And i do not issue
idle threats.

29:46.986 --> 29:50.955
Then don't, because
i don't want to hear it.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.459
Ok, chief.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.962
Mrs. Barrett was
promised some action.

29:57.997 --> 30:01.465
I think it's time
we get a court order

30:01.500 --> 30:03.968
and get you past
those guards.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.469
Sounds good to me.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.973
He ain't
worth it.

30:09.008 --> 30:09.974
Jerk.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.976
That's right.
He's a jerk.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.477
I told you that.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.479
You don't listen
to me.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.983
What are you two ladies
doing in here?

30:19.018 --> 30:23.487
Lillian, aren't you supposed
to be in class?

30:23.522 --> 30:25.489
Huh?

30:25.524 --> 30:27.491
Kaneesha?

30:27.526 --> 30:29.493
What's going on
here?

30:29.528 --> 30:30.494
Lillian?

30:30.529 --> 30:31.996
What is
this?

30:32.031 --> 30:33.998
You'll have to
ask her.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.500
Kaneesha,
what's the matter?

30:38.502 --> 30:40.504
I got pregnant.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.510
Please don't
be mad at me.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.514
Let me talk
to her alone.

30:58.522 --> 31:00.524
Did you tell
your mother?

31:00.559 --> 31:03.027
I can't.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.529
Reggie's
the father?

31:05.564 --> 31:07.531
He says it's not his,
but i know it is.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.534
I've never been
with no other boys.

31:10.569 --> 31:13.537
I never meant
for this to happen.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.039
You girls never do.

31:15.074 --> 31:19.043
So many of you bringing
babies into this world

31:19.078 --> 31:22.046
just to prove you can
accomplish something.

31:22.081 --> 31:25.049
And you're doing
so well now, kaneesha.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.051
There are other
alternatives.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.553
I'm scared.
I don't know what to do.

31:29.588 --> 31:32.056
I'll tell you
what we'll do.

31:32.091 --> 31:35.059
We'll have your mother
come to the school.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.061
We'll put our heads
together.

31:37.096 --> 31:40.564
I'm sure we'll be able
to help you decide

31:40.599 --> 31:44.535
what's best for you
to do. Trust me?

31:44.902 --> 31:45.903
Mr. Clark!

31:45.938 --> 31:48.405
8:00 a.m.
I'll call your mother.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.907
What is it?

31:49.942 --> 31:51.408
The fire chief.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.410
He got past
the gate.

31:53.445 --> 31:56.413
Code 10! Get those
chains off the door!

31:56.914 --> 31:58.415
The enemy's
here!

31:58.450 --> 32:00.918
We got it locked,
mr. Clark.

32:02.419 --> 32:04.922
Mr. Clark,
you're under arrest.

32:07.424 --> 32:08.926
For what?

32:08.961 --> 32:10.928
Basically
for being an asshole.

32:10.963 --> 32:13.430
Specifically for conspiracy
to violate of the fire code.

32:13.931 --> 32:14.932
I got no problem
with the fire code.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.433
The only problem here
is you.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.435
And your problem
is your mouth.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.938
Joe: Get those chains
off the doors!

32:20.973 --> 32:22.439
The enemy's here!

32:22.474 --> 32:25.442
Guard: We got it
locked, mr. Clark.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.944
Cuff him!

32:28.445 --> 32:30.447
Hey, mr. Clark!

32:30.948 --> 32:32.950
What's this
all about?

32:32.985 --> 32:36.453
It's about someone finally
standing up to this man

32:36.488 --> 32:39.456
instead of taking
his orders like a maid.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.959
How dare you
speak like that!

32:41.994 --> 32:42.960
Mrs. Barrett-

32:42.995 --> 32:44.461
shut up!
You're finished!

32:44.496 --> 32:46.463
The school board
will hear this at 7:00,

32:46.964 --> 32:49.967
and we'll vote
your black ass out.

32:50.002 --> 32:50.968
Yo, bitch,
vote on this!

32:51.468 --> 32:52.469
You go to class!

32:52.504 --> 32:54.471
You're
acting principal now.

32:54.506 --> 32:57.474
I expect you
to perform as i would.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.476
What-
what's going on?

32:59.511 --> 33:01.478
What did you
do?

33:01.513 --> 33:02.980
I chained the doors.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.983
You break the law,
you pay the price.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.492
We still got to
go to class?

33:15.527 --> 33:19.496
Yes. All of you,
get back to class! Now!

33:19.531 --> 33:20.998
Mr. Clark...

33:21.033 --> 33:22.499
go on!

33:23.000 --> 33:25.002
Who will look
after the school?

33:25.502 --> 33:27.004
Go on!
Get back to class!

33:27.039 --> 33:31.008
Get back in there,
all of you! Go on!

33:31.508 --> 33:33.510
Ms. Levias,
they're your responsibility!

33:46.523 --> 33:51.028
I guess we ought to
be getting out of here, joe.

33:51.063 --> 33:54.031
That school board meeting's
about to begin.

33:55.532 --> 33:57.534
Do whatever we can.

33:59.536 --> 34:02.539
Have you thought about
a new line of work?

34:03.040 --> 34:06.043
Perhaps an exciting career
in electronics?

34:07.544 --> 34:10.047
It's just
a little joke.

34:11.547 --> 34:13.050
I'm going.

34:22.559 --> 34:24.561
I've got
no complaints, joe.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.563
As far
as i'm concerned,

34:26.598 --> 34:29.565
what you accomplished
down at that school

34:29.601 --> 34:31.568
was a goddamn miracle.

34:31.603 --> 34:35.072
Those kids have a light
in their eyes now

34:35.107 --> 34:39.576
that was never,
never there before.

34:42.079 --> 34:43.580
Thanks, boss.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.588
You know, i'm always
trying to teach my kids

34:51.623 --> 34:53.590
to stay out of jail.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.094
Look at me.

34:59.596 --> 35:00.597
You go on.

35:01.098 --> 35:03.600
Do what you got to do.

35:14.077 --> 35:17.080
He has failed
at his professional task.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.083
We brought him in
to save our school

35:20.118 --> 35:22.586
from a takeover
from the state.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.589
That was the mandate
from our mayor.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.592
But the test scores
on the practice exam

35:28.627 --> 35:30.594
were 35% below passing.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.598
Now, maybe
if we dump him now

35:34.633 --> 35:37.100
and get a new principal
ourselves-

35:37.135 --> 35:40.103
show the state
that we're doing something-

35:40.138 --> 35:42.105
we can pre-empt
the takeover,

35:42.140 --> 35:45.108
but only if we get him out

35:45.143 --> 35:47.611
before those final
test scores come back.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.113
After that,
it'll be too late.

35:50.614 --> 35:52.616
This board won't
have any power.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.619
It'll be nothing
but a rubber stamp.

35:56.655 --> 36:00.624
Mrs. Arthur,
those are the facts.

36:00.659 --> 36:04.628
I appreciate your personal
loyalty to mr. Clark,

36:04.663 --> 36:06.630
but he has let
our children down,

36:06.665 --> 36:09.132
and our loyalty
should be to them.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.636
Our loyalty should be
to the man we hired.

36:15.138 --> 36:16.640
Order! Order!

36:37.160 --> 36:41.164
Free mr. Clark!

36:41.665 --> 36:54.678
Free mr. Clark!

36:55.178 --> 36:58.181
Free mr. Clark!

36:58.216 --> 37:00.183
Napier: Order,
ladies and gentlemen!

37:02.185 --> 37:03.186
Order, please!

37:03.687 --> 37:05.188
We cannot continue
this meeting

37:05.689 --> 37:07.691
with this kind
of chaos! Please!

37:08.191 --> 37:09.693
Sit down!
Come to order!

37:09.728 --> 37:12.195
Dr. Napier,
dr. Napier,

37:12.696 --> 37:16.700
i think you should
call the question now.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.702
I cannot call
the question.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.705
All points of view seem
to have been exhausted here.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.207
No further purpose
will be served by this.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.210
Why don't you have
someone on the board-

37:27.245 --> 37:30.213
mr. Clark's students
have assembled outside

37:30.248 --> 37:33.216
in an exercise of their
first amendment rights.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.718
How many?

37:34.753 --> 37:36.720
It looks like
all of them.

37:37.220 --> 37:38.221
Free mr. Clark!

37:38.722 --> 37:44.227
Free mr. Clark!

37:50.734 --> 37:53.236
We're in a tough spot here.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.239
I have to ask
your help, joe.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.742
It's not for me.
It's for those kids.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.745
They're very emotional.
They're all jacked up.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.746
You have
to send them home.

38:03.246 --> 38:07.250
I don't have to do nothing
but stay black and die.

38:07.751 --> 38:09.252
For crying out loud.

38:09.753 --> 38:10.754
Free mr. Clark!

38:11.254 --> 38:12.255
Free mr. Clark!

38:12.756 --> 38:13.757
Free mr. Clark!

38:14.257 --> 38:15.258
Free mr. Clark!

38:15.759 --> 38:19.262
Free mr. Clark!

38:19.297 --> 38:22.265
People, before
this gets out of hand,

38:22.300 --> 38:25.268
listen, for your own safety,
listen to me!

38:25.769 --> 38:26.770
Free mr. Clark!

38:27.270 --> 38:31.274
Free mr. Clark!

38:31.309 --> 38:34.778
All right, joe.
Let me put it this way.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.280
First, i wanted you
to succeed.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.784
Now, don't think that i
ever wanted anything else.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.787
But you're a realist,
joe, just like me.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.789
Think what
would happen

38:45.824 --> 38:47.791
if there was a riot

38:47.826 --> 38:50.794
and cops had to
clear that square.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.797
I'd have law and order
on my side,

38:53.832 --> 38:56.299
and the only people
who'd be hurt

38:56.334 --> 38:58.802
would be your kids.

38:59.202 --> 39:00.170
Free mr. Clark!

39:00.670 --> 39:01.671
Free mr. Clark!

39:02.172 --> 39:03.173
Free mr. Clark!

39:03.673 --> 39:04.674
Free mr. Clark!

39:05.175 --> 39:06.676
Free mr. Clark!

39:06.711 --> 39:08.178
Listen to me!

39:08.213 --> 39:10.180
People, please!

39:10.215 --> 39:14.184
You must all disperse
and return to your homes!

39:14.684 --> 39:17.187
Your presence here
is helping no one.

39:17.222 --> 39:20.190
Why don't you use your brains
and listen?

39:20.225 --> 39:25.695
Free mr. Clark!

39:30.235 --> 39:31.701
Thank you.

39:31.736 --> 39:33.203
Listen up.

39:33.238 --> 39:35.705
Settle down. Give her
a chance to talk.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.208
She might actually
have something to say.

39:38.243 --> 39:39.209
Chill. Settle down.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.711
Let's listen to the old
loudmouthed wench.

39:43.713 --> 39:45.215
Here you go,
barrett.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.716
Here you go.

39:49.219 --> 39:52.222
You can call me
what you want,

39:52.257 --> 39:54.191
but the simple fact is

39:54.226 --> 39:57.694
mr. Clark has broken the laws
of this state

39:57.729 --> 40:00.697
and exposed you all
to grave danger.

40:05.702 --> 40:07.204
His behavior
is irresponsible.

40:07.239 --> 40:10.207
Chaining those doors
was a criminal act.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.209
Why do you think
they call him "crazy joe"?

40:12.244 --> 40:15.212
Because you don't
understand him.

40:15.247 --> 40:16.713
Yeah.
That's right.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.715
He chained
those doors

40:19.216 --> 40:21.218
to keep out
the drug dealers.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.220
You're twisting
the law.

40:23.255 --> 40:26.223
The laws are made
to protect the people.

40:26.258 --> 40:28.725
That's what
he's doing for us.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.227
Yes!

40:31.228 --> 40:33.730
The thing that
you don't understand

40:33.765 --> 40:36.733
is that mr. Clark
believes in us.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.735
He doesn't
believe in you!

40:38.770 --> 40:39.736
You don't
take care

40:39.771 --> 40:41.738
of your
responsibility!

40:41.773 --> 40:45.242
Despite what he himself
may believe,

40:45.277 --> 40:47.744
mr. Clark is not
eastside high!

40:47.779 --> 40:50.747
Mr. Clark is not
only eastside high.

40:51.248 --> 40:53.250
Mr. Clark is
like a father,

40:53.285 --> 40:56.253
the only father
some of us know.

40:56.288 --> 40:57.754
You don't
know a thing

40:57.789 --> 40:59.256
about mr. Clark!

40:59.291 --> 41:01.258
People!
People, just hear me!

41:01.293 --> 41:04.261
The school board
is meeting right now,

41:04.296 --> 41:07.764
and we will give you
what eastside high deserves-

41:08.265 --> 41:09.266
a good principal.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.768
We don't want
a good principal!

41:11.803 --> 41:13.770
We want mr. Clark!

41:13.805 --> 41:16.773
You may think you know
what you want,

41:16.808 --> 41:20.277
but the question is
what is best for you,

41:20.312 --> 41:21.745
for eastside high.

41:22.145 --> 41:24.147
This thing's getting
out of hand.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.149
Talk to them,
please.

41:26.650 --> 41:29.152
...to see
that this gets resolved

41:29.187 --> 41:32.155
so that you can
continue your education.

41:32.190 --> 41:37.160
Free mr. Clark!

41:37.195 --> 41:39.162
People! People...

41:49.708 --> 41:51.174
yay!

41:51.209 --> 41:53.176
All right!

41:58.682 --> 42:02.686
I wonder why i can't get
this kind of turnout

42:02.721 --> 42:04.187
for study hall.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.191
All right, now.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.694
Kids, this is
all very nice,

42:10.729 --> 42:15.198
but now i'm going to insist
that you all go home

42:15.233 --> 42:18.201
and let the laws
of the land prevail.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.202
No!

42:19.237 --> 42:20.704
No! No! No!

42:21.204 --> 42:22.205
No! No! No!

42:22.240 --> 42:23.707
Now, listen.

42:23.742 --> 42:24.708
Listen.

42:24.743 --> 42:27.711
If i've taught you
anything,

42:27.746 --> 42:31.715
i have tried to give you
respect for the law.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.718
Now, i want you all
to go home

42:34.753 --> 42:36.720
in an orderly fashion!

42:36.755 --> 42:38.722
No! No! No!

42:38.757 --> 42:41.224
Your voices have been heard!

42:41.259 --> 42:44.728
No! No! No!

42:44.763 --> 42:48.732
I appreciate
your concern for me.

42:48.767 --> 42:50.233
No! No! No!

42:50.268 --> 42:52.736
But now is the time
to go home.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.738
No! No! No!

42:54.773 --> 42:57.741
Kids, listen. You're not
helping the matters any.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.743
You're not helping
our cause

42:59.778 --> 43:01.745
if you stay here.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.246
No! No! No!

43:03.281 --> 43:06.249
I thought i left you
in charge of these students.

43:06.284 --> 43:08.251
You got to
read this.

43:08.286 --> 43:11.254
Is this taking care
of your responsibility?

43:11.289 --> 43:12.756
Read it!

43:12.791 --> 43:16.259
No! No! No!

43:16.760 --> 43:17.761
No! No! No!

43:18.261 --> 43:19.262
No! No! No!

43:19.763 --> 43:20.764
No! No! No!

43:21.264 --> 43:22.265
No! No! No!

43:22.766 --> 43:23.266
Boss.

43:23.767 --> 43:24.768
No! No! No!

43:25.268 --> 43:26.269
No! No! No!

43:26.770 --> 43:27.771
No! No! No!

43:28.271 --> 43:32.275
Dr. Napier,
it is my duty-

43:32.776 --> 43:36.780
it is my privilege
and my honor to report to you

43:37.280 --> 43:39.282
that the students
of eastside high

43:39.783 --> 43:42.786
have passed the minimum
basic skills test!

44:08.311 --> 44:09.312
Mr. Mayor.

44:09.813 --> 44:11.314
Boy: Yeah!
All right!

44:11.349 --> 44:13.316
Go get him!

44:13.351 --> 44:15.819
Mr. Mayor,
on behalf of myself

44:15.854 --> 44:20.323
and on behalf of the students
of eastside high,

44:20.358 --> 44:23.827
you can tell the state
to go to hell.

44:30.333 --> 44:31.835
I told you.

44:31.870 --> 44:34.838
You should not
have brought him here...

44:34.873 --> 44:38.842
joe louis clark
is not going anywhere.

44:42.345 --> 44:44.347
Are you ready,
my ghosts?

44:44.382 --> 44:45.348
Yes!

44:45.383 --> 44:47.350
Let me hear it.

44:47.385 --> 44:50.353
1, 2, 3!

working together in unity

47:56.624 --> 47:57.590
and you're soon to see

47:57.625 --> 47:59.592
eastside high
as a better place to be

47:59.627 --> 48:01.594
the students, the pupils
have morals and scruples

48:02.095 --> 48:04.097
our learning ability
has increased quadruple

48:04.597 --> 48:06.599
and we're off
to a brand-new start

48:06.634 --> 48:08.601
i played my part
to prove that you're smart?

48:08.636 --> 48:09.602
And it's proven

48:09.637 --> 48:10.603
but i ain't movin'

48:10.638 --> 48:12.105
i won't be going,
i'm here

48:12.140 --> 48:14.107
when you need someone
to lean on

48:14.142 --> 48:16.609
so take heed to this
as a blessing and remember

48:16.644 --> 48:18.111
ain't no half steppin'

48:18.146 --> 48:19.612
get it in full gear

48:19.647 --> 48:21.614
i'm sure that you'll care
in the long run

48:21.649 --> 48:23.116
when you got full gear

48:23.151 --> 48:25.118
that means authority

48:25.153 --> 48:27.120
positivity

48:27.155 --> 48:28.121
word

48:28.156 --> 48:29.622
so let knowledge
uproot you

48:30.123 --> 48:32.125
go for yours,
'cause we're the future

48:32.160 --> 48:34.127
the ones who rise
to supremacy

48:34.162 --> 48:35.628
and if you ever
