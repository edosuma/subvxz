<i>Attention, Camp North Star,</i>

00:58.827 --> 01:03.890
<i>senior staff, counselors,</i>
<i>and counselors in training,</i>

01:06.401 --> 01:10.337
<i>please rise for our national anthem.</i>

01:42.304 --> 01:45.740
<i>How about that anthem, huh?</i>
<i>Gee, I don't know about you,</i>

01:45.874 --> 01:50.072
<i>but I just get a great big</i>
<i>lump in my throat every time I hear it.</i>

01:50.278 --> 01:53.839
<i>Well, it's 7:05 in the a.m.,</i>

01:53.949 --> 01:57.908
<i>and it's, wow, 43 degrees</i>

01:58.153 --> 02:00.144
<i>on the old Camp North Star</i>
<i>weather dial,</i>

02:00.255 --> 02:05.215
<i>and, well, that is kind of nippy</i>
<i>for a June 25, isn't it?</i>

02:05.327 --> 02:07.420
<i>I'm Tripper Harrison...</i>

02:09.731 --> 02:13.189
<i>I'm your head counselor,</i>
<i>and this is my wake-up show.</i>

02:13.568 --> 02:16.537
<i>I'll be coming at you every morning</i>
<i>about this time,</i>

02:16.638 --> 02:18.970
<i>hoping to make</i>
<i>your summer camp experience</i>

02:19.074 --> 02:22.942
<i>the best available in this price range.</i>

02:24.446 --> 02:28.246
<i>'Course, across the lake,</i>
<i>over at Camp Mohawk,</i>

02:29.918 --> 02:32.978
<i>they won't be getting up</i>
<i>for another hour or so,</i>

02:33.121 --> 02:34.918
<i>and when they do,</i>
<i>they'll be awakened by servants</i>

02:35.023 --> 02:37.617
<i>bearing croissants and caf√© au lait.</i>

02:37.959 --> 02:40.154
<i>Hope I didn't hit anybody.</i>

02:40.295 --> 02:41.922
<i>But over here,</i>
<i>at Camp North Star this morning,</i>

02:42.030 --> 02:44.555
<i>we're gonna be having</i>
<i>a delicious gruel breakfast,</i>

02:44.666 --> 02:49.899
<i>and don't forget to ask for seconds,</i>
<i>because it's all the gruel you can eat.</i>

04:04.579 --> 04:07.980
Okay, everybody.
Can I have your attention, please?

04:09.884 --> 04:13.183
Okay, everybody, <i>I'm</i> waiting.
People, settle down.

04:20.195 --> 04:22.186
Okay. <i>That's</i> better.

04:22.297 --> 04:24.265
Look it, <i>there's</i> a lot of new people
out there this year,

04:24.366 --> 04:26.926
so before we go any further,
I wanna introduce myself.

04:27.035 --> 04:28.366
My <i>name's</i> Morty Melnick.

04:28.470 --> 04:30.404
- Hi, Mickey.
- Hi, Mickey.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.733
My <i>name's</i> Morty, not Mickey.

04:33.608 --> 04:35.599
Now, the buses are leaving
tomorrow morning at 6:30

04:35.710 --> 04:36.802
to pick up the kids,

04:36.911 --> 04:38.936
and <i>it's</i> very important
you get your bus assignments

04:39.047 --> 04:40.537
to know which group of
kids you're in charge of.

04:47.956 --> 04:49.787
<i>Don't</i> argue with me, Bradley.

04:49.891 --> 04:52.382
Now, you can get rabies
from a raccoon, too.

04:52.494 --> 04:54.155
- Tell him, Morrie.
- <i>That's</i> right, Bradley.

04:54.262 --> 04:56.890
And <i>don't</i> forget to put paper
on the toilet seat cover,

04:56.998 --> 04:58.158
<i>'cause you could get
a terrible infection...</i>

04:58.266 --> 05:00.734
Oh, you know what I meant to ask you,
did you bring smokes?

05:00.835 --> 05:02.769
Oh, no, I couldn't. I forgot.

05:02.904 --> 05:06.032
My mom found the carton
in my suitcase, she had a shit-fit.

05:06.141 --> 05:08.041
- Well, why <i>don't</i> we go get some?
- Yeah, okay.

05:08.143 --> 05:11.977
Mommy? Mommy?
<i>Where's</i> my mommy?

05:12.514 --> 05:15.779
Tripper, <i>I'm</i> looking forward
to some action this summer,

05:15.917 --> 05:18.181
I hope you and your gentlemen
can supply it for me.

05:18.286 --> 05:22.052
Well, I could supply you, but the guy
you gotta watch out for is Spaz.

05:22.157 --> 05:24.421
- Spaz?
- <i>He's</i> a sex machine.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.557
Are you kidding me?

05:27.662 --> 05:30.096
He <i>couldn't</i> wake me up
with a trumpet and a drum.

05:30.198 --> 05:34.567
Well, I went out with him one night,
and he got us six nurses by himself,

05:34.669 --> 05:38.332
and four of them
<i>couldn't</i> report to work the next morning.

05:42.711 --> 05:44.440
You gonna be okay?

05:44.946 --> 05:48.279
Hey, I'll see you
at the end of the summer, okay?

05:48.783 --> 05:49.909
Okay.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.793
This bus does not have
a safety inspection sticker.

06:03.898 --> 06:05.058
<i>It's</i> a fine old bus.

06:05.166 --> 06:08.966
No, <i>it's</i> not. It is a piece of junk.
I need to tell my father,

06:09.070 --> 06:11.732
and <i>he's</i> gonna report you
to the Department of Motor Vehicles.

06:11.840 --> 06:12.864
Roxanne!

06:13.007 --> 06:16.602
And you're going to jail. You know?
Jail? Behind bars?

06:16.811 --> 06:18.938
Yeah, just like last year, we'll hate it.

06:19.047 --> 06:21.277
Yeah. Camp is lousy, and you're a dork.

06:21.383 --> 06:24.511
Yeah, yeah, you're right,
you sure are one.

06:24.953 --> 06:26.181
- Hiya.
- Come on.

06:26.287 --> 06:27.413
- Hi.
- What do you want?

06:27.522 --> 06:30.514
- What, are you having trouble?
- I <i>can't</i> get these kids on the bus.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.616
- Okay. Let me talk to them.
- <i>That's</i> because <i>I'm</i> not going.

06:32.727 --> 06:34.592
Come here, guys,
I wanna have a word with you, all right?

06:34.696 --> 06:35.754
No.

06:35.864 --> 06:37.559
- Okay, now you guys, look, you...
- What?

06:37.665 --> 06:38.927
- You better get on the bus, or...
- Why?

06:39.033 --> 06:43.129
Well, because if you don't,
<i>I'm</i> gonna beat the pants off of you.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.938
Not bad, huh?

07:00.722 --> 07:04.351
- Hey, watch it, that <i>stuff's</i> expensive.
- Very good, sir.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.891
Hey, Spaz, bud. How you doing, buddy?

07:10.999 --> 07:13.160
Hey, Spaz, good to see you.

07:13.268 --> 07:14.394
Oh, hey, give that back.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.129
Come on, Spaz.
No, we're doing you a favor.

07:16.237 --> 07:19.001
- Give it back!
- You wanna make us, Spaz?

07:21.943 --> 07:24.571
- Yeah.
- Horse, give him back the milkshake.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.306
All right, all right. Here you go.

07:32.754 --> 07:35.985
Hey, we'll see you
at the basketball game, Spaz.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.360
Mohawk jerks.

07:40.795 --> 07:43.889
These children are going to the
most glamorous of all summer camps,

07:43.998 --> 07:45.158
Camp Mohawk.

07:45.266 --> 07:49.930
<i>There's</i> a two-year waiting list,
and every child has to be voted in.

07:50.038 --> 07:53.906
On top of all that, it costs $1,000 a week
to go to Camp Mohawk.

07:54.042 --> 07:57.011
The question is,
is it worth $1,000 a week?

07:57.111 --> 08:00.171
It sure is.
<i>It's</i> the best darn camp there is.

08:00.482 --> 08:02.473
Well, are you connected
with Camp Mohawk?

08:02.584 --> 08:05.485
Well, I think so, <i>I'm</i> the
program director, Jerry Aldini.

08:05.587 --> 08:07.953
Well, how do you justify $1,000 a week?

08:08.089 --> 08:10.057
Well, we have some
special programs.

08:10.158 --> 08:12.626
We're doing Shakespeare in the Round
again this year, of course.

08:12.727 --> 08:15.560
Our political round table.
Henry Kissinger will appear.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.130
Yasser Arafat is gonna come out,

08:17.232 --> 08:18.995
spend a weekend with the kids,
just rap with them.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.158
<i>That's</i> amazing.

08:20.268 --> 08:21.292
And the kids wanted animals,

08:21.402 --> 08:24.701
so this year, each camper
will stalk and kill his own bear

08:24.806 --> 08:26.364
in our private wildlife preserve.

08:26.474 --> 08:28.908
Are you sure the children can hack that?

08:29.010 --> 08:31.240
We'll see.
But the real excitement, of course,

08:31.346 --> 08:33.041
is gonna come
at the end of the summer,

08:33.147 --> 08:34.409
during Sexual Awareness Week.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.347
We import 200 hookers
from around the world,

08:36.451 --> 08:41.217
and each camper, armed with only
a Thermos of coffee and $2,000 cash,

08:41.322 --> 08:44.155
tries to visit as many countries
as he can, and the winner, of course,

08:44.259 --> 08:46.022
is named
King of Sexual Awareness Week,

08:46.127 --> 08:49.563
and is allowed to rape and pillage the
neighboring towns until camp ends.

08:49.664 --> 08:50.756
<i>That's</i> incredible.

08:50.865 --> 08:52.856
What do you expect for $1,000 a week?

08:52.967 --> 08:54.594
Hey, you have
a good summer, too, huh?

09:34.709 --> 09:37.872
Hey. You must be the short,
depressed kid that we ordered.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.673
Glad you made it.

09:41.416 --> 09:43.145
Want half this?

09:50.925 --> 09:54.486
Come on inside, Frankenstein,
I'll buy you a cocktail.

09:54.596 --> 09:56.257
Okay, all the 12-year-old
girls here finally?

09:56.364 --> 09:58.855
Gonna be a terrific year.
Got a real good bunch this year.

10:00.034 --> 10:04.061
This ground is too slippery. I could fall
and get whiplash or a broken neck.

10:04.205 --> 10:06.070
You know, those are serious injuries.
A guy could die...

10:06.174 --> 10:09.575
- Phil? <i>He's</i> all yours.
- Thanks, Tripper. You Rudy Gerner?

10:09.711 --> 10:11.679
Hi, <i>I'm</i> Phil. You're in my cabin, okay?

10:11.779 --> 10:13.474
- Gotta get this...
- Hi, Morty.

10:13.581 --> 10:15.515
- Hi, Trip. You got the rules?
- No, <i>I'm</i> looking for a copy.

10:15.617 --> 10:17.380
Okay, here you go.

10:17.952 --> 10:19.351
Very important, all your CITs

10:19.454 --> 10:22.184
have gotta know those inside out,
backwards, forward, whatever you want.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.316
Post them up, make sure
they know them. Very important.

10:28.963 --> 10:30.328
Hey, Larry.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.597
- Larry!
- What?

10:35.069 --> 10:36.934
I think that chick over there
is staring at me.

10:37.038 --> 10:39.404
- Which chick? Where?
- Over there.

10:41.109 --> 10:43.270
Hey, she is staring at you.

10:43.478 --> 10:47.278
You better go over and talk to her.
She probably wants it.

10:55.256 --> 10:58.555
- <i>What's</i> cooking, good looking?
- Your <i>fly's</i> undone.

11:04.666 --> 11:09.126
Renzetti, come here.
Hey, Fink, come on. Off your knees.

11:10.138 --> 11:12.265
Hey, Spaz, I was watching you.

11:12.407 --> 11:13.840
Looked like you had a chance there
for a second.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.408
Thanks, Trip.

11:17.278 --> 11:18.905
- My man, my main man.
- Hey, Tripper.

11:19.013 --> 11:21.914
- Hey, boy.
- Eyes right, gentlemen.

11:22.016 --> 11:23.881
- Hey.
- Hey, are these free?

11:23.985 --> 11:26.886
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi. Hi, Mary.

11:26.988 --> 11:30.389
- Fine. Just right, left, right, left.
- Jeez, <i>that's</i> right.

11:30.491 --> 11:34.757
All right, these are the camp rules.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.353
Morty would like you all
to take a look at these.

11:37.465 --> 11:40.093
They'll be in here, if you
wanna check these out a little bit later.

11:40.201 --> 11:42.465
And now, gentlemen, and you are,

11:42.603 --> 11:44.935
<i>I'm</i> gonna take you over to your
cabin assignments for the first week.

11:45.039 --> 11:45.471
<i>Let's</i> go.

11:46.941 --> 11:49.432
All right, this is the six-year-old cabin.

11:49.544 --> 11:52.411
All they know how to do is eat
and wet their beds.

11:52.513 --> 11:55.414
You have to teach them everything else.
Crockett, take it.

11:55.516 --> 11:57.347
No, no, Trip. I <i>don't</i> want it.
No six-year-olds.

11:57.452 --> 11:59.079
Oh, come on, Trip,
I <i>don't</i> wanna...

11:59.187 --> 12:00.518
<i>That's</i> my man. Good luck.

12:01.189 --> 12:04.124
Put the comic book away,
and get your shirt.

12:04.225 --> 12:10.255
Take the shirt by the shoulders.
One, fold sleevie. Two, fold sleevie.

12:10.698 --> 12:12.632
- Presto. <i>It's</i> done.
- <i>How's</i> this?

12:12.734 --> 12:14.031
- <i>How's</i> this, Mike?
- <i>That's</i> not bad.

12:14.135 --> 12:15.363
Listen, why <i>don't</i> we just have a nap,

12:15.470 --> 12:17.267
and we'll come back later
and try it, okay?

12:17.371 --> 12:18.531
- No, forget it.
- No.

12:18.639 --> 12:20.607
Come on, guys.
Do I have to count to three?

12:20.708 --> 12:24.371
One, two... <i>Two's</i> good enough.

12:24.545 --> 12:26.103
Come on, Steve.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.681
Hey, <i>what's</i> that?

12:35.423 --> 12:38.551
<i>It's</i> Ernie, my pet frog. <i>He's</i> a jumper.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.129
- How come he <i>doesn't</i> hop?
- <i>He's</i> tired, I guess.

12:42.230 --> 12:45.358
- No, <i>he's</i> dead.
- No, <i>he's</i> sleeping.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.297
For sure, <i>he's</i> dead.

12:48.002 --> 12:50.869
Mister, could you help me
wake up my frog?

12:52.707 --> 12:56.438
He looks tired. Why <i>don't</i> we just
let him sleep a little longer, okay?

12:56.544 --> 12:57.636
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:57.745 --> 13:02.079
Take that nap now, all right? And I'II...
I'll take care of the frog.

13:04.085 --> 13:05.746
All right,
this is the 14-year-old <i>girls'</i> cabin.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.150
They've got the drive
and the equipment,

13:07.255 --> 13:08.984
- but they <i>don't</i> have the experience.
- Right.

13:09.090 --> 13:12.321
<i>They'd</i> better not get it from you guys.
Not this summer, anyway, huh?

13:12.426 --> 13:16.192
Roxanne.
Just the person I wanted to see.

13:16.430 --> 13:18.762
Later, Tripper. Say, Christmas?

13:19.967 --> 13:23.767
A.L., <i>that's</i> your cabin.
You got the jailbait. Watch them.

13:23.905 --> 13:25.770
- Women.
- Thanks.

13:26.474 --> 13:27.634
See you later.

13:27.742 --> 13:30.836
Roxanne, I want you to know
that <i>I'm</i> very deeply hurt,

13:30.945 --> 13:32.378
and I mean that sincerely.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.005
Glad to hear it. Excuse me.

13:43.224 --> 13:44.782
Hi, Larry.

13:48.062 --> 13:49.359
Hi, Spaz.

13:50.331 --> 13:51.457
Spaz!

13:56.137 --> 13:59.402
Hey, guess what, guys?
Liza finally got her period.

13:59.507 --> 14:00.531
- Liza.
- Liza.

14:00.641 --> 14:04.099
- You <i>don't</i> have to advertise it.
- But they gotta know.

14:04.245 --> 14:07.214
Hey, Liza you better watch it,
<i>'cause now you can get pregnant.</i>

14:07.315 --> 14:08.646
Yeah, I heard about this girl,

14:08.749 --> 14:11.183
and she got pregnant
without doing it with anyone.

14:11.285 --> 14:14.152
What do you mean?
You <i>can't</i> get pregnant without doing it.

14:14.255 --> 14:17.554
No, stupid.
She <i>didn't</i> do it, she almost did it.

14:17.658 --> 14:18.886
My God.

14:18.993 --> 14:21.518
- Hi, guys. I got your cabin this week.
- Hi, A.L.

14:21.629 --> 14:22.823
Hey.

14:22.964 --> 14:26.422
- Go on. Ask her, ask A.L.
- Ask me what?

14:26.534 --> 14:29.992
A.L., can a girl get pregnant
if she almost does it with a guy?

14:30.137 --> 14:33.334
Almost? I <i>don't</i> think so, no.

14:33.808 --> 14:35.435
<i>That's</i> a relief.

14:37.378 --> 14:40.870
Okay, Spazalopolous, you're
in here with Phil and the 12-year-olds.

14:40.982 --> 14:42.040
This here is Rudy.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.946
- Hi, Rudy.
- Hey, Rudy. <i>How's</i> it going?

14:44.051 --> 14:46.451
Gotta watch out for this guy,
<i>he's</i> done time for car theft.

14:46.554 --> 14:48.419
Oh, yeah? My kind of guy there, Rudy.

14:48.522 --> 14:51.252
He could be a bad influence
on the other children.

14:51.359 --> 14:53.020
Watch it. We'll see you guys at dinner.

14:53.127 --> 14:55.357
- Okay.
- Watch out for the ear, Rudy. Look out!

14:55.463 --> 14:56.555
See you later, Spaz.

14:56.664 --> 14:58.359
- Bye-bye, guys.
- Bye, Spaz.

14:58.633 --> 15:01.363
Not bad. Over the head.

15:01.736 --> 15:02.760
Hi, guys. <i>I'm</i> Spaz.

15:02.870 --> 15:05.031
<i>I'm</i> your CIT this week.
I wanna introduce you...

15:05.139 --> 15:07.198
- Hey, look, <i>it's</i> Spaz!
- <i>It's</i> Spaz!

15:08.376 --> 15:11.368
I wanna introduce you to a new guy
in the cabin, that...

15:11.479 --> 15:14.448
Hey, bozo, this is my bunk, so shove off.

15:18.185 --> 15:22.485
Settle down. Settle down, okay.
Hey, come on, guys. Settle down.

15:22.590 --> 15:24.888
Okay, <i>let's</i> see, <i>everything's</i> put away.
<i>That's</i> good.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.290
Everybody has a bunk. <i>That's</i> good.

15:27.495 --> 15:29.326
<i>Everybody's</i> settled in. <i>That's</i> good.

15:29.430 --> 15:32.297
And <i>everybody's</i> been deloused
and fingerprinted. <i>That's</i> good.

15:32.400 --> 15:36.234
Phil, look, <i>it's</i> the first day of camp,
and we're bored already.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.031
What are we gonna do, huh?

15:38.172 --> 15:40.197
Relax, Peter, relax.

15:40.341 --> 15:44.004
Okay, you guys, after lunch
we got a big game with cabin B-11,

15:44.111 --> 15:46.944
and I really wanna win it, okay?
So, what do you say?

15:47.048 --> 15:48.242
- We're gonna kill them!
- We're gonna kill them!

15:48.349 --> 15:49.407
Gonna what?

15:49.517 --> 15:50.609
- We're gonna kill them!
- We're gonna kill them!

15:50.718 --> 15:51.776
I <i>can't</i> hear you.

15:51.886 --> 15:53.148
- We're gonna kill them!
- We're gonna kill them!

15:53.254 --> 15:54.687
We're gonna kill them!

15:55.256 --> 15:58.692
<i>Attention all campers, afternoon</i>
<i>swim schedule is as follows:</i>

15:58.793 --> 16:00.624
<i>Advanced dolphins</i>
<i>will report to the dock</i>

16:00.728 --> 16:02.355
<i>for survival swimming and IQ testing.</i>

16:02.463 --> 16:05.523
<i>All senior silverfish,</i>
<i>meet on the beach for nude sunbathing.</i>

16:05.633 --> 16:08.966
<i>Junior salmon, trout and herring,</i>
<i>report to the nearest delicatessen,</i>

16:09.070 --> 16:11.903
<i>and six-year-old tadpoles,</i>
<i>report to the swamp.</i>

16:12.039 --> 16:15.566
<i>And all lobsters, get out of here,</i>
<i>you're a menace!</i>

16:31.459 --> 16:34.223
- David says that <i>it's</i> very...
- Hi, girls.

16:34.328 --> 16:37.695
<i>I'm</i> really looking forward
to working with all of you this summer.

16:37.798 --> 16:39.823
I just hope <i>there's</i> enough of me
to go around.

16:39.934 --> 16:42.368
Lance, please. We're eating.

16:52.913 --> 16:54.380
Oh, crap!

16:54.482 --> 16:57.417
Why do I have to
stack the dishes again?

16:57.518 --> 17:00.919
I <i>don't</i> have the energy. <i>I'm</i> weak.
<i>I'm</i> weak from hunger.

17:01.022 --> 17:03.252
Fink. Less flak, more stack.

17:03.357 --> 17:06.155
Gossip! Gossip! We want gossip!

17:06.292 --> 17:09.592
Gossip! Gossip! We want gossip!

17:09.696 --> 17:12.723
Gossip! Gossip! We want gossip!

17:26.814 --> 17:30.773
Okay. Okay, we have a gossip update.
This is the news.

17:30.885 --> 17:34.685
It seems as though
last <i>summer's</i> hottest couple have split.

17:34.822 --> 17:38.314
I <i>can't</i> tell you their names,
but her initials are A.L.,

17:38.459 --> 17:41.155
and <i>he's</i> the hottest CIT on wheels.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.130
We all know they spent
most of last summer in the bushes,

17:45.232 --> 17:48.429
but the question is,
will true love bloom again?

17:48.536 --> 17:52.131
And speaking of CITs,
<i>there's</i> a certain girl named Wendy

17:52.239 --> 17:54.935
<i>who's</i> giving all the guys wet dreams.

17:59.747 --> 18:01.476
Okay, Jody, thank you very much.

18:01.582 --> 18:03.106
Everybody,
when you're finished stacking,

18:03.217 --> 18:04.844
all the cabins
can go to their other activities.

18:09.056 --> 18:12.287
Okay, you guys, <i>let's</i> play ball, okay?
<i>Let's</i> go!

18:13.928 --> 18:16.897
<i>Let's</i> move. We gotta get back
to the cabin for rest period.

18:16.997 --> 18:19.830
If <i>I'd</i> wanted to rest,
I would have stayed in Cleveland.

18:19.934 --> 18:21.561
You and Trip are playing defense.
Get your shirts off.

18:21.669 --> 18:23.398
Hey, all right! What do you say?
We're defense, buddy.

18:23.504 --> 18:26.234
Okay, you guys. Come on, <i>let's</i> go. We
can win this game, all right. Come on.

18:26.340 --> 18:29.207
Hardware, you're doomed.
Come on, you guys.

18:35.549 --> 18:41.146
Come on. Come on, people.
Down here. Come on.

18:41.255 --> 18:43.917
Come on, you guys, <i>let's</i> kill them.

18:47.128 --> 18:49.995
Come on, Rudy,
get it back the other way.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.229
Yeah!

18:56.370 --> 18:58.201
Do we have to have
this guy on our team?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.330
Do we gotta have Gerner on our team?
<i>He's</i> totally useless.

19:00.441 --> 19:01.965
- He sucks!
- <i>He's</i> terrible.

19:02.076 --> 19:05.773
I know, I know. Okay, come on,
you guys. <i>Let's</i> regroup...

19:37.077 --> 19:39.807
Yeah, could I have some fries, please?

19:47.221 --> 19:50.281
Hey, Gerner. <i>How's</i> it going?

19:53.327 --> 19:56.728
This is the best damn food
in the whole Two Pines area.

19:56.864 --> 19:58.889
<i>I'm</i> not surprised you found this place.

19:58.999 --> 20:02.435
I had you pegged for a gourmet
first time I met you.

20:03.204 --> 20:05.866
You know, <i>that's</i> a smart move,
bringing a suitcase.

20:05.973 --> 20:07.634
You <i>don't</i> wanna be leaving
a lot of valuable socks

20:07.741 --> 20:08.901
and underwear around camp,

20:09.009 --> 20:11.773
where people can rustle around in them
when you're out on the town.

20:11.879 --> 20:13.870
Thank you.

20:14.014 --> 20:15.811
You like ketchup?

20:17.151 --> 20:18.675
<i>I'm</i> going away.

20:19.753 --> 20:21.345
You going to Vegas?

20:21.488 --> 20:23.115
If you're going to Vegas, man,
I would be up for it,

20:23.224 --> 20:27.126
because I love that town.
<i>I'm</i> a party guy, I love that town.

20:27.695 --> 20:30.129
I <i>don't</i> think they want me around.

20:30.231 --> 20:33.223
What, are you talking about
the soccer-heads back there?

20:33.334 --> 20:37.896
Well, <i>that's</i> life in the fast-paced,
slam-bang, <i>live-on-the-razor's</i> edge,

20:38.038 --> 20:41.405
laugh-in-the-face-of-death world
of junior league soccer.

20:41.542 --> 20:45.740
<i>I'm</i> serious. I never played
the game before. I tried to tell them.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.648
What? You tried to tell...

20:49.383 --> 20:50.714
And they...

20:50.851 --> 20:55.550
Who was it? I'll get them.
I'll get them with this Swiss Army knife.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.288
The Swiss trained me to kill,
and I will do it.

20:58.392 --> 21:01.486
I will grab these guys by the neck,
take the toothpick,

21:01.595 --> 21:03.654
and stick it right in between their teeth.

21:03.764 --> 21:05.823
And then I'll slap them around the head
a couple of times.

21:05.933 --> 21:08.231
They'll go out for just a couple
of seconds, they'll be unconscious,

21:08.335 --> 21:09.962
and while they're doing that,
I'll go for the corkscrew.

21:10.070 --> 21:12.334
And I'll grab them,
and I'll take that corkscrew,

21:12.439 --> 21:14.737
and I will stick it right into the voice box.

21:14.842 --> 21:19.074
I will twist that mofo, I will twist it
into his voice box, and rip that thing,

21:19.213 --> 21:22.649
rip it out, and he'll talk like this
for the rest of his life.

21:22.750 --> 21:26.481
I <i>don't</i> wanna hurt anyone.
I just want them to like me.

21:28.689 --> 21:29.747
Why?

21:30.557 --> 21:35.085
If you make one good friend a summer,
then you're doing pretty well.

21:41.135 --> 21:45.504
Look, if you have trouble, come to me,
tell me, and I'll help you.

21:48.776 --> 21:51.040
<i>What's</i> that? What is that?
Is that yes or no?

21:51.145 --> 21:55.013
Yes is like this, and no is just
twisting, twisting, twisting. Okay?

21:55.115 --> 21:56.514
- Well, it was yes.
- It was this one?

21:56.617 --> 21:57.777
- Definitely?
- Yes, one of those.

21:57.885 --> 21:59.216
You're positive it <i>wasn't</i>
a side-to-side one?

21:59.320 --> 22:00.480
No, it <i>wasn't</i> one of those.

22:00.587 --> 22:03.283
<i>'Cause you could hurt your neck
doing that. Okay...</i>

22:03.390 --> 22:06.359
Have you got wheels?
<i>'Cause I need a lift back to camp.</i>

22:06.460 --> 22:09.224
My folks <i>won't</i> let me drive
<i>'cause they caught me drinking,</i>

22:09.330 --> 22:12.231
they just <i>don't</i> let me out of the house
any more, 'cause <i>I'm</i> a jerk, they said.

22:12.333 --> 22:15.200
They're gonna send me
to military school.

22:15.903 --> 22:18.133
You forgot something, Rudy.

22:18.639 --> 22:20.402
Thanks for the fries.

22:33.954 --> 22:35.148
Jesus!

22:36.457 --> 22:38.652
- Christ, Hardware.
- You animal. What are you doing?

22:38.759 --> 22:40.420
- I <i>can't</i> handle it.
- You mook, why <i>don't</i> you warn me

22:40.527 --> 22:42.927
when you're gonna play
with your dynamite?

22:45.933 --> 22:47.662
What are you doing, Hardware?

22:47.768 --> 22:51.431
<i>I'm</i> hooking up this heavy-duty outlet
here for our new air conditioner.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.938
- An air conditioner? <i>That's</i> great.
- <i>That's</i> right.

22:54.041 --> 22:57.772
- Well, where is it?
- <i>Morty's</i> office. He loves the heat.

23:00.981 --> 23:02.073
Okay.

23:02.182 --> 23:05.174
An air conditioner just <i>doesn't</i> get up
and walk away.

23:05.319 --> 23:09.312
- Any idea where it might be, Tripper?
- I have no idea.

23:09.857 --> 23:13.657
- Maybe it was stolen, Morty.
- Of course, it was stolen,

23:14.294 --> 23:15.761
but <i>I'm</i> gonna find it.

23:15.863 --> 23:18.798
Will you two go over
the schedules, please?

23:20.033 --> 23:21.466
Okay, ready?

23:23.470 --> 23:27.031
Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
2:00 to 4:00 p.m.,

23:27.174 --> 23:29.369
junior boys and junior girls.

23:30.744 --> 23:34.771
Tuesday and Thursday,
2:00 to 4:00 p.m., junior boys.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.482
Thursday and Friday, 4:00 to 5:00...

23:37.584 --> 23:39.211
- Roxanne.
- What?

23:39.353 --> 23:43.847
I have to tell you this as a friend.
I can see right down your blouse.

23:45.058 --> 23:47.151
I can see everything, too.

23:47.728 --> 23:50.128
Tripper, is there something
seriously wrong with you?

23:50.230 --> 23:53.688
Roxanne, I have what doctors call
<i>"very active glands".</i>

23:54.034 --> 23:56.502
You're the only person I've told,
my folks <i>don't</i> even know.

23:56.603 --> 23:59.731
Well, maybe you can have surgery
without them knowing.

23:59.873 --> 24:04.537
- Heck with surgery. <i>Let's</i> wrestle.
- No, <i>let's</i> not, okay, Tripper? No...

24:06.647 --> 24:08.842
The atomic skull crusher.

24:09.883 --> 24:14.445
<i>Let's</i> not do this. Okay, Tripper?
<i>Let's</i> just stop right now. Okay? Okay?

24:22.196 --> 24:25.029
- Dip lock.
- What? Tripper, no.

24:25.165 --> 24:28.066
- Shark-infested waters!
- No, <i>don't</i> do that, Tripper. No. No.

24:28.168 --> 24:29.999
Tripper!

24:32.873 --> 24:35.842
<i>Let's</i> stop now, okay? No, huh? Let's...

24:36.710 --> 24:38.837
<i>I'm</i> sorry about that blouse thing,
but somebody had to tell you.

24:38.946 --> 24:41.346
Tripper, get off of me right now,
or I start screaming.

24:41.448 --> 24:44.076
Oh, at the count of three, I guess, huh?
One, two...

24:44.184 --> 24:45.549
- Help!
- Help!

24:45.686 --> 24:47.153
Help!

24:47.254 --> 24:48.812
- Help me!
- No, please.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.685
- Somebody, help!
- Let me get off.

24:50.791 --> 24:52.383
Get off me! Morty!

24:52.526 --> 24:54.824
- What the <i>hell's</i> going on here?
- Oh, Morty!

24:54.928 --> 24:57.192
Morty. Morty. Morty.

24:58.265 --> 25:00.062
She attacked me.

25:00.200 --> 25:04.500
- Give me a break, Harrison, will you?
- She came at me like an animal.

25:10.143 --> 25:12.611
Would you get a hold of yourself?

25:17.618 --> 25:20.781
<i>It's</i> great. You <i>can't</i> even see it
from outside, because of the bushes.

25:20.888 --> 25:22.116
Okay, this is it.

25:22.222 --> 25:25.783
This is it.
Now, in five seconds, we're talking five,

25:25.926 --> 25:27.951
we are gonna have
the coolest cabin in camp.

25:28.061 --> 25:29.858
- All right.
- Sweet.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.625
- Yes, sir. Thank you, Mickey.
- Yes!

25:32.766 --> 25:35.792
All right, <i>let's</i> do it.
<i>Let's</i> do it. You ready?

25:35.936 --> 25:37.164
- Are you ready?
- <i>I'm</i> ready.

25:37.271 --> 25:38.295
All right.

25:38.438 --> 25:43.876
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- Do it!

25:50.984 --> 25:53.145
- Hardware?
- Yeah, Crockett.

25:53.287 --> 25:54.618
You're a dick.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.701
Okay, pit stop. Change the tires.

27:26.513 --> 27:27.810
Not bad.

27:28.348 --> 27:31.476
You got pretty good form.
<i>It's</i> real good, Rudy.

27:31.585 --> 27:32.813
Really?

27:33.220 --> 27:36.280
Yeah. Well, you know,
<i>it's</i> your first time out.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.190
<i>It's</i> okay.

27:38.325 --> 27:40.486
You wanna get into shape, though,

27:40.594 --> 27:45.054
you gotta come out every morning
with me. I'll make you into an animal.

27:47.401 --> 27:50.393
Top physical condition,
you gotta pay the price.

27:50.537 --> 27:52.630
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:57.811 --> 27:59.301
<i>Attention campers.</i>

27:59.446 --> 28:02.540
<i>Remember, this is killer bee season</i>
<i>in the North Woods,</i>

28:02.649 --> 28:04.913
<i>so don't provoke</i>
<i>any flying yellow things,</i>

28:05.018 --> 28:07.418
<i>you're just asking for trouble.</i>

28:14.795 --> 28:19.391
Hey, Crockett, I told Candace I was
gonna christen my boat, "The <i>Candace",</i>

28:19.599 --> 28:22.261
and she just about had a heart attack.

28:22.369 --> 28:25.964
I <i>don't</i> think she knew
how much in love we really were.

28:26.807 --> 28:30.334
- Hey, Crockett, can you help me a sec?
- Sure, Candace.

28:31.645 --> 28:33.579
Hurry up, come on.

28:39.119 --> 28:40.814
What are you doing?

28:41.455 --> 28:44.913
Crockett, this is the first time
I've ever kidnapped a guy.

28:45.025 --> 28:48.153
- No kidding, huh?
- You'll be released unharmed.

28:48.328 --> 28:52.526
I just want you long enough to tell you
that <i>I'm</i> really attracted to you.

28:52.666 --> 28:54.099
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

28:55.135 --> 28:57.160
I think <i>I'm</i> special, too.

28:57.738 --> 29:00.764
Hell, you're the only one in this camp
that I really wanna spend time with!

29:00.874 --> 29:01.898
- Really?
- Yeah!

29:02.008 --> 29:03.532
Well, what about Lance Cashman then?

29:03.643 --> 29:04.735
- Lance Cashman?
- Yeah, Lance.

29:04.845 --> 29:07.405
Lance Cashman is a total jerk-off!

29:09.316 --> 29:13.013
All right! She likes me! She likes me!

29:15.322 --> 29:18.086
<i>"Jerk-off"?</i> I <i>don't</i> jerk off.

29:18.792 --> 29:22.751
- I <i>don't</i> know how to do this.
- Just throw it up in the air, and hit it.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.840
- <i>I'm</i> sorry. I...
- Why <i>don't</i> we serve?

29:42.415 --> 29:43.814
Yeah...

29:46.386 --> 29:50.288
Did you see the way she
handed you the racket? She wants it.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.355
You guys ready? Here it comes.

29:54.761 --> 29:57.025
- I got it. <i>It's</i> mine!
- Get it, get it!

29:57.164 --> 29:59.132
Come on, lob it! Lob it! Try...

29:59.232 --> 30:01.826
- I got it!
- I got it. I got it. I got...

30:02.669 --> 30:07.072
- I thought you said you had it, meatball.
- Well, then, you serve, then.

30:10.677 --> 30:11.837
Ready?

30:15.282 --> 30:18.410
I got it, I got it, I got it! <i>I'm</i> gonna get it!

30:21.354 --> 30:23.788
<i>Attention. Here's an update</i>
<i>on tonight's dinner.</i>

30:23.890 --> 30:27.087
<i>It was veal. I repeat, veal.</i>

30:27.227 --> 30:29.024
<i>The winner of tonight's</i>
<i>mystery meat contest</i>

30:29.129 --> 30:32.895
<i>is Jeffrey Corbin,</i>
<i>who guessed "some kind of beef".</i>

30:33.099 --> 30:36.432
<i>Congratulations, Jeffrey. You just won</i>
<i>a brand new Chrysler Cordoba,</i>

30:36.536 --> 30:39.198
<i>and you can pick it up at Morty's office.</i>

30:42.075 --> 30:43.406
You bet.

30:44.811 --> 30:45.937
Five.

30:48.748 --> 30:50.511
I'll see that five.

30:52.752 --> 30:54.947
- Want a card?
- No.

30:57.390 --> 30:59.255
I'll take one. Eight.

31:01.228 --> 31:02.456
15.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.761
18. I'll stick.

31:09.302 --> 31:10.530
20.

31:14.908 --> 31:18.105
You shark! You're playing
some sort of system, <i>aren't</i> you?

31:19.246 --> 31:22.579
You've been watching the cards,
marking the cards.

31:34.995 --> 31:37.054
From the diaphragm. <i>Let's</i> see.

31:39.165 --> 31:42.862
Oh, really? Really?

31:44.337 --> 31:46.100
From the diaphragm.

31:49.976 --> 31:53.468
<i>That's</i> not from the diaphragm. Ante up.

31:55.081 --> 31:58.244
- What do you do in the off season?
- Go to school.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.280
20.

32:03.089 --> 32:06.217
20? What are you,
some sort of madman?

32:08.161 --> 32:10.755
Is that what they teach you
in that school of yours, 20?

32:10.864 --> 32:12.729
I'll see your 20.

32:12.832 --> 32:15.767
I hope you walk out of here with nothing.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.467
I think I like history the most.

32:19.606 --> 32:23.838
<i>It's</i> fun to imagine that <i>I'm</i>
in some other time, in a different place.

32:24.177 --> 32:26.475
Shut up and look at your cards.

32:29.783 --> 32:31.148
Blackjack.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.590
19.

32:40.894 --> 32:42.327
21.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.255
I've had it. <i>That's</i> it.

32:46.833 --> 32:48.767
Card monster. Get out!

32:53.173 --> 32:56.199
I think you're pretty tired. I think you
ought to go home and go to sleep.

32:56.309 --> 32:58.470
- This was great.
- Well, yeah, this was great.

32:58.578 --> 33:00.375
You're the guy walking home
with all the peanuts.

33:00.480 --> 33:05.179
If I were walking home with the peanuts,
<i>it'd</i> be incredible, <i>it'd</i> be sensational.

33:05.418 --> 33:06.976
Are you going to bed?

33:07.087 --> 33:08.714
No, I've called
an organizational meeting

33:08.822 --> 33:11.484
of the CITs
for a little bit later this evening.

33:11.591 --> 33:13.718
No midgets allowed. Sorry.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.487
Well, enough of
this playing for peanuts.

33:17.597 --> 33:20.828
Tomorrow night we play
for real stakes, zucchini.

33:22.369 --> 33:24.462
Children starving in India,
and you're walking around

33:24.571 --> 33:26.801
with a whole sombrero full of peanuts.

33:26.906 --> 33:28.806
I hope you sleep well.

33:30.410 --> 33:32.207
Night, Tripper.

33:43.556 --> 33:45.649
<i>Attention all campers.</i>

33:46.626 --> 33:48.753
<i>It's now 9:30,</i>

33:48.862 --> 33:52.263
<i>and that's lights-out time, 9:30,</i>
<i>as you know.</i>

33:52.699 --> 33:54.633
<i>Tomorrow is Parents Day,</i>

33:54.734 --> 33:58.761
<i>and you must look rested, or Morty</i>
<i>will be sent to the state penitentiary.</i>

34:11.083 --> 34:12.813
- What are you doing?
- Shut the light!

34:12.918 --> 34:14.545
- Get up!
- Come on.

34:16.922 --> 34:21.724
- What is this, breakfast?
- Hardware, get up! Up, up!

34:23.029 --> 34:24.690
<i>Who's</i> the puppy?

34:27.567 --> 34:29.125
What? What?

34:29.235 --> 34:31.635
All right, gentlemen, big event.

34:32.739 --> 34:36.539
- Operation Late Night Excitement.
- Another panty raid, Trip?

34:36.743 --> 34:39.041
No questions, dog face!

34:39.579 --> 34:41.478
Dress up and move out!

35:18.618 --> 35:20.051
Tie him up.

35:28.595 --> 35:32.190
<i>Don't</i> wake him. Tie him gently, now.
He needs his sleep.

35:34.467 --> 35:35.957
On your guard.

35:36.836 --> 35:39.066
Prepare to raise the casket.

35:53.186 --> 35:54.949
<i>Won't</i> fit, Trip.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.618
Spin him.

36:10.770 --> 36:13.238
Company, rotate.

36:18.444 --> 36:21.709
Right face. Right face.

37:03.990 --> 37:05.821
Morning, Mr. Melnick.

37:06.125 --> 37:08.685
- Hey, Mickey!
- Hello, Mickey!

37:09.229 --> 37:10.355
Hey, Mickey!

37:11.231 --> 37:14.257
- Hi, Mickey!
- Hey, Mickey!

37:15.235 --> 37:17.032
- Sleepy?
- Hello, Mr. Melnick.

37:18.037 --> 37:19.595
Morning, Melnick.

37:23.643 --> 37:27.272
Lots of room, lots of room. Looks fine,
Dad. Looks good, Dad. Come on.

37:27.380 --> 37:29.610
- Am I okay?
- Come on. Looks fine, Dad.

37:32.252 --> 37:33.685
Sorry, Dad.

37:40.727 --> 37:41.785
Yo.

37:44.163 --> 37:46.825
You <i>don't</i> have to run with me today,
I know you got things to do.

37:46.933 --> 37:50.232
No, <i>I'd</i> rather run,
it takes my mind off sex.

37:51.537 --> 37:54.301
- Is your dad coming up today?
- He can't.

37:55.375 --> 37:58.469
Mine <i>can't</i> either,
<i>he's</i> gotta mow the lawn.

37:59.912 --> 38:02.346
Mind hanging out with me today?

38:02.448 --> 38:04.416
- No.
- Okay.

38:33.946 --> 38:37.313
- Hey, you got any kids in your family?
- No.

38:37.417 --> 38:40.147
- Did you ever do any time? Prison?
- No.

38:41.187 --> 38:43.655
- You know to hotwire a car?
- Not yet, no.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.280
Well, you'll learn in class.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.655
Did you read in the paper today
about the Polish terrorist?

38:47.760 --> 38:49.159
- No.
- Yeah. A tragedy.

38:49.262 --> 38:52.754
They sent this guy to blow up a car, and
the guy burns his mouth on the tailpipe.

38:52.865 --> 38:55.095
<i>That's</i> an old one.
You'll get that a lot up here.

38:55.201 --> 38:57.396
Rattlesnake! Look out.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.586
All right, quiet.

39:20.426 --> 39:25.193
<i>"She turned her head from side to side

- I can hear them.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:32.572 --> 39:37.475
- This book is really disgusting.
- Well, it sounds great to me.

39:38.010 --> 39:39.477
I <i>don't</i> believe this.

39:39.612 --> 39:41.876
<i>"She could no longer contain the plea."</i>

39:41.981 --> 39:43.539
Oh, my God.

You little hunk of honey bunch.

39:48.621 --> 39:49.883

- I said <i>I'm</i> getting a boner.
- Will you...

40:21.888 --> 40:23.287
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

40:23.389 --> 40:25.482
I think I hear something.

40:30.830 --> 40:32.627
Okay, <i>let's</i> go check it out.

Quiet.

Spaz, you're ripping my face off!

Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!

41:46.572 --> 41:48.904
See you at Camp Mohawk, Morty.

42:04.190 --> 42:05.748

I <i>don't</i> know, Trip, those Mohawks
look better than last year.

42:42.061 --> 42:45.462
Guys, <i>it's</i> important for us
to hustle at both ends of the court.

42:45.565 --> 42:48.898
We gotta make the offense work.
We gotta play that big tough D.

42:49.001 --> 42:51.993
We gotta contain their big men inside.
We gotta crash the boards on offense.

42:52.104 --> 42:53.969
We <i>can't</i> give them the baseline
at any price.

42:54.073 --> 42:56.803
But more important
than the score of this game,

42:56.943 --> 42:59.912
is to score at the big social
at our place tonight.

43:00.012 --> 43:03.209
So, I want you guys to go out there
and protect your balls at any cost.

43:03.316 --> 43:04.749
- All right.
- You can count on it.

- Sorry, guys.
- Sink it over here.

43:20.366 --> 43:23.392
All right, this is how <i>it's</i> done.
This is how <i>it's</i> done.

43:23.502 --> 43:26.198
Oh, looks good, Hardware. Looks good.

43:27.974 --> 43:30.534

- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

44:01.874 --> 44:04.638
Hey, Wheels,
you're going home in an ambulance.

44:04.777 --> 44:06.972
- Nice shirt, Crockett.
- Thanks.

44:07.113 --> 44:08.410
- All right, guys.

Assholes.

44:29.502 --> 44:30.799
- Am I all right?
- That was a great try, buddy.

44:30.903 --> 44:32.598
Oh, yeah. I think we're in big trouble.

44:32.705 --> 44:34.935
That <i>Crockett's</i> really cute.

44:35.207 --> 44:37.869
Yeah, but he <i>can't</i> play basketball
worth a shit.

44:38.010 --> 44:41.343
Go, North Star, go.

44:44.984 --> 44:47.817
There are five guys.
They play offense and defense,

44:47.920 --> 44:49.615
but they play
at different ends of the court,

44:49.722 --> 44:51.849
and they switch sides at half-time.

44:52.858 --> 44:54.086
Wheels!

44:57.129 --> 44:58.460
Hardware!

44:59.198 --> 45:00.756
- You all right?
- Yeah.

45:00.900 --> 45:02.265
Help me, Spaz, come on.

45:02.368 --> 45:04.859
Take it easy, easy. Come on.

45:05.004 --> 45:07.973
Now you know
why they call that guy Rhino.

45:08.541 --> 45:11.635
- Oh, my God, his nose is bleeding.
- <i>It's</i> gonna get even bigger now.

45:11.744 --> 45:13.041
Jackie.

45:13.179 --> 45:15.374
- Come here. You okay?
- Yeah.

45:15.514 --> 45:18.108
Hardware Renzetti, girls.
<i>It's</i> just a nosebleed.

45:18.217 --> 45:20.811
Looks like <i>he's</i> gonna be
at the big social tonight.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.114
He'll be there.

45:22.221 --> 45:24.689
It really <i>doesn't</i> look any worse, really.

45:24.924 --> 45:26.414
- Really?
- Go out there and kill 'em.

45:26.525 --> 45:28.049
- All right.
- Fazul!

45:28.194 --> 45:29.491
- Come on!
- Hardware!

45:29.595 --> 45:30.721
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

45:30.830 --> 45:31.922
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

45:32.031 --> 45:34.397
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

45:40.339 --> 45:43.274
Hey, Larry, you scored!

45:43.876 --> 45:47.869
Way to go! Okay, you guys,
feed Fink, <i>he's</i> our hot man.

45:49.415 --> 45:51.110
All right, there!

45:51.817 --> 45:52.909
Okay, cover me!

45:53.018 --> 45:56.647
Come on, <i>let's</i> go! <i>Let's</i> go!
<i>Let's</i> kill 'em!

45:56.756 --> 45:59.725
- Come on, guys. <i>That's</i> it.
- Oh, sure.

46:03.028 --> 46:06.464
Hey, Larry! Larry, again.
Do it again, Larry!

46:18.711 --> 46:19.609
- <i>It's</i> all right, <i>it's</i> okay!
- <i>It's</i> all right, <i>it's</i> okay!

46:19.712 --> 46:21.270
- We can beat 'em anyway!
- We can beat 'em anyway!

46:21.380 --> 46:22.972
- <i>It's</i> all right, <i>it's</i> okay!
- <i>It's</i> all right, <i>it's</i> okay!

46:23.082 --> 46:25.846
- We can beat 'em anyway!
- We can beat 'em anyway!

46:32.291 --> 46:35.556
Okay, the <i>zone's</i> not working.

46:35.694 --> 46:38.162
They're a little bit too good
to cover man to man,

46:38.264 --> 46:40.528
and we <i>can't</i> shoot for shit.

46:40.633 --> 46:42.260
What kind of talk is that
for a coach, huh?

46:42.368 --> 46:44.928
- Yeah, Trip.
- Look, <i>I'm</i> not gonna lie to you guys.

46:45.037 --> 46:47.028
<i>There's</i> no way
we're gonna beat this team.

46:47.139 --> 46:50.074
- What are we gonna do, Trip?
- We're gonna lose.

46:50.209 --> 46:51.836
What?

46:52.244 --> 46:55.611
But we can lose with some self-respect.
And <i>here's</i> the idea.

47:01.320 --> 47:02.651
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

47:02.755 --> 47:05.121
- Go, North Star, go!
- Go, North Star, go!

47:10.496 --> 47:12.964
Morty, nice team spirit.

47:13.098 --> 47:15.692
I'll talk to you after the game, Tripper.

47:16.268 --> 47:17.701
- How we doing?
- Late as usual, Morty.

47:17.803 --> 47:19.361
Where were you, young man?

47:19.471 --> 47:22.065
Okay, you guys, a little teamwork, now.

47:29.248 --> 47:30.237
Yeah!

47:35.120 --> 47:36.246
Beautiful.

47:40.993 --> 47:43.461
Spaz! Get in. Spaz, hurry up!

47:48.734 --> 47:52.568
This is the proudest moment
in North Star history!

48:15.427 --> 48:18.453
Forget it, Spaz. They all want me.

48:24.937 --> 48:27.269
You know,
Candace is sure looking good tonight.

48:27.373 --> 48:30.274
So he offered me 200 bucks
to run the sailing program.

48:30.376 --> 48:34.813
I said, "Forget <i>it!"</i> I mean, 200 bucks
<i>doesn't</i> even buy me a pair of shoes.

48:34.947 --> 48:36.608
I mean, <i>I'm</i> the best.

48:37.116 --> 48:39.311
Now the serious partying can begin.

48:39.451 --> 48:40.782
- Okay.
- Hey.

48:41.320 --> 48:45.814
Okay! Virgins on the right,
non-virgins on the left.

48:46.292 --> 48:49.420
You fellows can divide them up
any way you like.

48:56.835 --> 48:58.598
I got the virgins this time,
you had them last time.

48:58.704 --> 49:00.399
Okay, you got them,
but I get them next time.

49:00.506 --> 49:02.030
- Okay, buddy.
- <i>Let's</i> go. <i>There's</i> two right there.

49:02.141 --> 49:03.369
Come on.

49:05.177 --> 49:06.439
- Hi, Roxanne.
- Hi, Morty.

49:06.545 --> 49:08.536
Really groovy tunes, eh?

49:11.216 --> 49:13.184
Hi, Jackie. Hi, Wendy.

49:15.054 --> 49:17.750
<i>There's</i> Jackie.
Why <i>don't</i> you go ask her to dance?

49:17.856 --> 49:22.452
- No, that <i>Wendy's</i> driving me wild.
- Yeah, but Jackie wants it.

49:24.263 --> 49:25.787
I have to talk with Roxanne

49:25.898 --> 49:28.093
about a highly personal matter
about one of the campers.

49:28.200 --> 49:29.599
Will you excuse us for a second?

49:29.702 --> 49:31.465
- Yeah, well, I was...
- Yeah.

49:38.544 --> 49:42.776
Is that a bra you're wearing, or are you
expecting an assassination attempt?

49:45.551 --> 49:49.146
Are those Clorets in your pocket
or are you just glad to see me?

49:49.254 --> 49:53.486
Okay. We're even. Three years of this.

49:54.593 --> 49:59.053
I <i>don't</i> think I have many lines left.
Frankly, Roxanne, <i>I'm</i> frightened.

49:59.198 --> 50:01.792
Oh, <i>don't</i> go human on me now, Trip.

50:01.900 --> 50:04.130
I really like to dance.

50:04.603 --> 50:09.302
<i>It's</i> the music, I guess. It starts my feet
tapping and I get all happy inside.

50:09.541 --> 50:11.475
I guess <i>it's</i> just
something I was born with.

50:11.577 --> 50:13.511
Kind of a birth defect, huh?

50:14.179 --> 50:18.240
- <i>Let's</i> go get some air.
- I think not.

50:19.885 --> 50:21.853
Well, <i>I'm</i> trying.

50:23.889 --> 50:25.550
So, keep trying.

50:27.192 --> 50:29.888
I gotta go change the record.

50:32.297 --> 50:36.757
You can change the record,
but <i>don't</i> you change. Promise me?

50:38.871 --> 50:43.706
I'll be waiting right here. Hurry!
Rush, darling! Rush, darling.

51:17.743 --> 51:20.143
- You know something, A. L?
- What?

51:20.279 --> 51:24.739
- This is a very serious moment.
- It is?

51:25.184 --> 51:27.550
<i>Don't</i> you know what tonight is?

51:29.855 --> 51:32.323
<i>Tonight's</i> our third anniversary.

51:32.458 --> 51:35.950
- Three years ago, tonight, we met.
- Oh, that is serious.

51:36.095 --> 51:38.393
Oh, God, <i>I'm</i> sorry. I forgot.

51:49.408 --> 51:51.205
Happy anniversary.

51:55.013 --> 51:59.143
You know, Wheels, for a jerk,
you're really a nice guy.

51:59.685 --> 52:01.243
Well.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.249
- Come on, <i>let's</i> dance.
- Oh, no.

52:03.355 --> 52:06.449
- Come on!
- No, I <i>don't</i> know how.

52:06.592 --> 52:10.722
One, two, three. Simple as that.
Come on, <i>let's</i> dance.

52:10.963 --> 52:12.897
I'll lead, you follow.

52:31.150 --> 52:32.276
<i>Attention, campers.</i>

52:32.384 --> 52:35.217
<i>Arts and crafts has been canceled</i>
<i>due to bad taste.</i>

52:35.320 --> 52:37.788
<i>All junior girls are now junior boys.</i>

52:37.890 --> 52:38.948
<i>And Nurse Omako says</i>

52:39.057 --> 52:42.151
<i>that the raccoon fever epidemic</i>
<i>is officially over.</i>

52:42.361 --> 52:45.023
<i>Hey, you on the water skis!</i>

52:53.472 --> 52:57.499
- I saw you dancing with Roxanne.
- Oh, yeah?

53:00.145 --> 53:02.511
Well, she sort of cornered me,

53:02.648 --> 53:05.947
and there was nothing I could do
without embarrassing her.

53:06.318 --> 53:08.115
Do you like her?

53:10.022 --> 53:13.549
Well, I feel sorry for her, you know?
<i>She's</i> got a glass eye.

53:13.892 --> 53:15.860
And <i>I'm</i> one of the few people

53:15.994 --> 53:18.588
who knows exactly which eye to look at
when they're talking to her,

53:18.697 --> 53:21.461
so <i>she's</i> sort of fixated on me.

53:22.367 --> 53:24.232
Well, I like her.

53:24.369 --> 53:27.395
Well, you're not exactly
known for your taste.

53:28.540 --> 53:32.636
I'll probably just use her
for the rest of the summer, and then

53:32.945 --> 53:37.348
throw her on the scrap heap with all the
rest of the women that I've destroyed.

53:39.952 --> 53:42.011
I have to go on this overnight.

53:42.120 --> 53:45.749
<i>I'm</i> taking the CITs on
an overnight for the next couple of days,

53:45.891 --> 53:47.916
so you're gonna have to
do your own training, son.

53:48.026 --> 53:51.086
I want you to run two miles today,
and two and a half tomorrow.

53:51.196 --> 53:52.595
I've never run that far.

53:52.698 --> 53:54.825
Neither have I,
but <i>somebody's</i> gotta do it.

53:54.933 --> 53:58.232
I <i>can't</i> be expected to do it.
<i>Somebody's</i> gotta do it,

53:58.370 --> 54:02.170
and it <i>can't</i> be me,
because <i>I'm</i> too busy.

54:02.274 --> 54:04.401
I have responsibilities.

54:04.543 --> 54:07.535
<i>I'm</i> the entertainment director
for the overnight.

54:07.713 --> 54:09.578
Come here.

54:09.715 --> 54:12.980
<i>Somebody's</i> gotta make these PA
announcements for me while <i>I'm</i> gone.

54:13.085 --> 54:15.747
Wake up. Lights out. Public Service.

54:15.887 --> 54:17.184
Otherwise, <i>I'm</i> gonna get
in a lot of trouble.

54:17.289 --> 54:18.381
- No.
- So, <i>I'd</i> appreciate it

54:18.490 --> 54:20.390
- if you could help me out on this...
- No, Trip, I <i>don't</i> wanna

54:20.492 --> 54:24.121
- do the announcement. No... Wear...
...and accept this nomination.

54:26.832 --> 54:28.026
- Trip.
- Okay, now,

54:28.133 --> 54:30.397
all you have to do is
turn on this power switch here.

54:30.502 --> 54:31.799
- Everything will be hunky-dory, okay?
- No, Trip,

54:31.903 --> 54:33.336
I <i>don't</i> wanna do the announcements.
Come on...

54:33.438 --> 54:36.407
And you can start by telling
all the CITs to meet me

54:36.508 --> 54:38.976
down at the boat dock <i>immediamente.</i>

54:39.111 --> 54:41.079
I'll see you in a couple days.

54:44.182 --> 54:47.618
Hey, remember,
run two miles, then two and a half,

54:47.753 --> 54:51.086
and then run three or four
if I <i>don't</i> come back, all right?

54:52.691 --> 54:55.455
- Problem?
- We <i>don't</i> have steering problems,

54:55.594 --> 54:56.686
we've got manpower problems.

54:56.795 --> 54:58.422
You're going too fast, Trip, slow down.

54:58.530 --> 55:00.498
Oh, no, don't.

55:01.133 --> 55:03.101
- Okay, Finkel.
- What?

55:03.201 --> 55:05.567
- Paddle!
- Hey, you're splashing me!

55:05.671 --> 55:07.138
Paddle!

55:07.272 --> 55:10.673
- Nice and even backstroke, Hardware.
- Yes, sir.

55:13.045 --> 55:17.846
Spaz, keep us in the sun.
I wanna even out my tan.

55:19.017 --> 55:21.645
Look at that! Got it?

55:23.989 --> 55:26.014
- Spaz!
- Hey, Spaz!

55:26.558 --> 55:32.360
<i>You love me, baby</i>
<i>But I love you and you love me</i>

55:32.497 --> 55:35.625
<i>So let's just walla walla</i>

55:35.767 --> 55:39.828
<i>Six to eight hours a day</i>
<i>Down by the mango tree</i>

55:39.971 --> 55:43.338
<i>Dang it, you, dang it, you</i>
<i>Dang it, you said</i>

55:43.642 --> 55:46.839
<i>I love you</i>
<i>If you love me</i>

55:46.978 --> 55:49.310
Come on, you know the words, Rocky!

55:49.448 --> 55:53.680
<i>I love me, so let's walla walla</i>

55:54.186 --> 55:57.781
<i>Down by the mango tree</i>

56:00.492 --> 56:04.292
<i>And I love you, if you love me</i>

56:04.963 --> 56:08.990
<i>But you love you, and I love me</i>

56:09.134 --> 56:13.537
<i>So let's walla walla</i>
<i>Down by the mango tree</i>

56:14.139 --> 56:18.371
<i>Let's walla walla</i>
<i>Down by the mango tree</i>

56:29.254 --> 56:31.347
Have you kissed many guys?

56:32.691 --> 56:36.457
- Does family count?
- No, like, I meant real guys.

56:37.229 --> 56:41.996
Well, two. Only, one was a real creep.

56:43.935 --> 56:46.529
How did the creep do it?

56:47.005 --> 56:48.802
Spaz, what do you mean,
how did he do it?

56:48.907 --> 56:53.640
No, like, I mean, did he ask you,
or did he just do it?

56:54.045 --> 56:56.309
He just did it.

56:59.918 --> 57:02.045
<i>It's</i> a weird moon.

57:03.789 --> 57:05.689
The moon kills, you know.

57:07.359 --> 57:09.088
It feeds off the earth.

57:10.195 --> 57:12.254
On a night like this,

57:12.431 --> 57:14.262
one of us could get up
in the middle of the night,

57:14.366 --> 57:16.732
grab an ax,
and cut <i>somebody's</i> head off.

57:19.604 --> 57:21.265
I remember a night like this
a few years ago.

57:21.373 --> 57:25.571
A guy and a girl went out driving,
it was one of their first dates.

57:25.710 --> 57:28.440
It started out kind of casual,
but they ended up deciding to go park,

57:28.547 --> 57:31.015
not too far from here,
as a matter of fact.

57:31.116 --> 57:34.085
While they're going at it,
listening to the radio,

57:34.219 --> 57:36.380
all of a sudden,
a news bulletin broke in.

57:36.488 --> 57:39.423
<i>"A dangerous lunatic has escaped</i>

57:39.558 --> 57:42.925
<i>"from the hospital for
the criminally insane at Two <i>Pines."</i></i>

57:43.061 --> 57:44.961
Oh, come on, Trip.

57:45.096 --> 57:49.362
They described him as a monster,
six-and-a-half-feet tall,

57:49.468 --> 57:51.936
260 pounds,

57:52.137 --> 57:56.574
with one horrible distinguishing feature,

57:57.442 --> 58:01.708
a sharpened stainless-steel hook

58:03.014 --> 58:06.279
where his right hand used to be.

58:07.486 --> 58:09.283
That was enough for the guy.

58:09.421 --> 58:12.720
He slammed the car into gear,
floored it, bounced off a tree,

58:12.824 --> 58:15.156
<i>didn't</i> stop
till they got to the <i>girl's</i> house.

58:15.260 --> 58:18.093
Got out of his side,
walked around to hers.

58:18.263 --> 58:22.597
There, hanging in the door,
covered with blood,

58:23.535 --> 58:26.231
- was a stainless-steel hook.
- Oh!

58:26.338 --> 58:29.432
The strangest part,
is that after all these years,

58:29.541 --> 58:33.568
after the biggest manhunt
in Two <i>Pines'</i> history,

58:33.678 --> 58:35.976
they never found the killer.

58:38.049 --> 58:40.711
Some people say
<i>he's</i> still up here in the woods,

58:40.819 --> 58:43.413
waiting for the chance to kill again.

58:45.857 --> 58:47.757
And I say...

58:48.894 --> 58:50.987
I say they're right!

58:58.803 --> 59:01.829
- Hey, my dinner!
- Hey, listen, <i>that's</i> a bullshit story.

59:01.973 --> 59:04.373
No, you guys, <i>it's</i> true. I heard it before.

59:04.476 --> 59:06.637
- Yeah.
- Only, I heard it was on a beach.

59:06.745 --> 59:07.803
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

59:07.913 --> 59:09.540
No, I heard it happened in a park.

59:09.648 --> 59:13.015
Oh, I heard it,
but the guy was missing a foot.

59:13.151 --> 59:16.314
How could the guy have
a hook on his foot?

59:23.895 --> 59:27.456
- Now, that was nice, Tripper.
- Thank you.

59:28.567 --> 59:30.592
Thank you, very much.

59:31.202 --> 59:34.660
I think I am lying
on some sort of animal,

59:34.806 --> 59:38.105
like a porcupine.

59:38.310 --> 59:40.972
- Just a broken beer bottle.
- Oh.

59:41.079 --> 59:43.843
I was wondering
what you were yelling about.

59:45.884 --> 59:49.320
- Where are you going?
- <i>I'm</i> going swimming.

59:51.523 --> 59:54.822
- The <i>water's</i> great! Come on in.
- No!

59:54.960 --> 59:56.928
You're not supposed to swim
for half an hour

59:57.028 --> 59:59.019
after close physical contact,

59:59.164 --> 01:00:02.600
- you get bad cramps.
- Come on, chicken, <i>it's</i> not so cold.

01:00:02.701 --> 01:00:05.499
- No, I know you're lying.
- Come on.

01:00:06.705 --> 01:00:08.605
All right.

01:00:14.879 --> 01:00:18.781
- <i>It's</i> not so bad, is it?
- Worse than I ever imagined!

01:00:19.351 --> 01:00:22.115
Come here, <i>there's</i> a real cold spot.

01:00:33.898 --> 01:00:35.661
I've heard of the buddy system,
but this is ridiculous.

01:00:35.767 --> 01:00:39.328
Tripper, you really talk too much.

01:00:39.437 --> 01:00:41.769
Well, I was just wondering if these
were shark-infested waters.

01:00:41.873 --> 01:00:43.465
Shut up.

01:00:49.581 --> 01:00:53.813
- Hey, there is a shark down there.
- My God, there is.

01:00:53.918 --> 01:00:55.010
I think <i>we'd</i> better go back

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.248
to my sleeping bag
before something goes wrong.

01:01:01.059 --> 01:01:03.323
What happened? Where were you?

01:01:04.696 --> 01:01:08.063
- I was with Jackie in the woods.
- In the woods?

01:01:08.933 --> 01:01:11.163
- Right where you want her.
- Yes.

01:01:11.603 --> 01:01:16.097
Oh, Spaz! You old make-out master!
How far did you get?

01:01:16.241 --> 01:01:18.801
Oh, we just went down to Lookout Point,
and then we got cold...

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:22.243
No, no, no, no! How did you make out?

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:25.178
Well, you know, we just kind of talked.

01:01:25.283 --> 01:01:27.478
You had her in the woods,
and you just talked?

01:01:27.585 --> 01:01:29.450
- No, no, well...
- You <i>didn't</i> do anything.

01:01:29.554 --> 01:01:32.387
- We were sort of sitting...
- You <i>didn't</i> do anything!

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:34.048
I...

01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:38.461
- I held her hand when we walked home.
- Held her hand?

01:01:40.465 --> 01:01:42.797
Spaz, you're on your way!

01:01:42.934 --> 01:01:44.902
- <i>That's</i> great!
- Yeah? Yeah?

01:01:45.003 --> 01:01:46.698
- Held her hand?
- Yeah.

01:01:46.805 --> 01:01:48.705
- In the woods?
- Yeah.

01:01:48.807 --> 01:01:51.105
- And it was dark?
- Yeah.

01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:53.106
Wow!

01:01:53.845 --> 01:01:57.781
- <i>Let's</i> celebrate.
- Huh? Right.

01:01:58.183 --> 01:02:00.151
Here, help yourself.

01:02:00.285 --> 01:02:03.482
- I think I'll have Cheezies.
- The Cheezies?

01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:06.715
Yeah. I'll have Cheezies, too.

01:02:13.698 --> 01:02:16.963
- Bobby?
- Oh, no.

01:02:17.936 --> 01:02:22.236
Oh, no, <i>don't</i> ever call me Bobby.
All right?

01:02:22.707 --> 01:02:26.643
I mean, my grandmother
calls me Bobby. I hate it.

01:02:26.778 --> 01:02:29.178
So, I like it when you call me Crockett.

01:02:29.314 --> 01:02:30.906
- Okay.
- All right?

01:02:32.016 --> 01:02:35.782
- Wanna hear me say it?
- Yeah, okay.

01:02:35.887 --> 01:02:38.253
Okay. Crockett.

01:02:41.459 --> 01:02:42.756
Crockett.

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.191
Crockett.

01:03:44.823 --> 01:03:47.553
- Going in. Yes, you are.
- No, no, no, no!

01:03:57.535 --> 01:03:59.662
Looking good. All right!

01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:03.334
<i>Important announcement!</i>

01:04:03.441 --> 01:04:06.239
<i>Some hunters have been seen</i>
<i>in the woods near Piney Ridge Trail,</i>

01:04:06.344 --> 01:04:07.777
<i>and the Fish and Game Commission</i>
<i>has raised</i>

01:04:07.879 --> 01:04:10.507
<i>the legal kill limit on campers to three!</i>

01:04:10.615 --> 01:04:14.107
<i>So, if you're hiking today, please wear</i>
<i>something bright, and keep low.</i>

01:04:14.219 --> 01:04:15.584
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:04:25.964 --> 01:04:27.022
<i>What's</i> the matter with you?

01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:30.191
You're pacing like an expectant father
with the clap.

01:04:32.837 --> 01:04:36.000
- The <i>Olympiad's</i> tomorrow.
- So?

01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:39.944
- I wanna do well.
- You wanna do well?

01:04:40.044 --> 01:04:42.444
Bet every dime you got
on Camp Mohawk.

01:04:42.547 --> 01:04:44.947
I <i>don't</i> wanna mess up again.

01:04:45.717 --> 01:04:48.481
Well, <i>let's</i> see what you're entered in.

01:04:51.389 --> 01:04:54.153
Gerner, Gerner, Gerner.

01:04:55.193 --> 01:04:57.127
The potato race.

01:04:57.228 --> 01:05:00.629
Damn it, <i>don't</i> they know
you're just a kid?

01:05:00.732 --> 01:05:05.533
Two years ago,
a boy fell on a potato, mashed himself.

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:10.368
<i>Let's</i> see what else you're in. Egg toss!

01:05:10.508 --> 01:05:11.975
Oh, no.

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:16.479
Probably, the most punishing
of all food-related sports.

01:05:16.581 --> 01:05:20.745
- <i>I'm</i> good at that one.
- Sure, you got the build for it.

01:05:20.885 --> 01:05:22.318
Oh, <i>don't</i> worry.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:26.652
You <i>won't</i> screw up tomorrow,
no worse than anybody else, anyway.

01:05:27.759 --> 01:05:31.559
Are you gonna go and see Roxanne
after <i>Morty's</i> rally?

01:05:33.131 --> 01:05:34.928
Could be.

01:05:36.601 --> 01:05:38.125
After the way she treated me
on the overnight,

01:05:38.236 --> 01:05:41.763
<i>I'm</i> a little afraid to be alone with her,
and I think you know what I mean.

01:05:41.873 --> 01:05:44.273
I think you like her.

01:05:44.976 --> 01:05:49.208
Really. Admit it.
You really do like her, <i>don't</i> you?

01:05:50.615 --> 01:05:55.211
Yes, you do. Come on, admit it.
You like her.

01:05:56.421 --> 01:05:59.447
Ah, you like her. You <i>won't</i> admit it.

01:06:11.669 --> 01:06:13.398
You pig!

01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:26.416
<i>Hi. I'm Morty Melnick.</i>

01:06:26.517 --> 01:06:28.712
- Hi, Mickey!
- Hi, Mickey!

01:06:28.987 --> 01:06:31.512
<i>And we at Camp North Star,</i>
<i>would like to welcome</i>

01:06:31.622 --> 01:06:33.249
<i>our Camp Mohawk competitors...</i>

01:06:33.358 --> 01:06:36.088
- Camp North Star sucks!
- Camp North Star sucks!

01:06:36.194 --> 01:06:40.096
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em,
let me at 'em!

01:06:40.932 --> 01:06:42.365
<i>Quiet down, quiet down.</i>

01:06:42.467 --> 01:06:45.800
<i>To our annual two-day Olympiad.</i>

01:06:46.504 --> 01:06:49.769
<i>So, let the games begin!</i>

01:07:41.159 --> 01:07:43.525
Uh-oh.

01:07:44.762 --> 01:07:46.992
You got any last-minute advice, Trip?

01:07:47.098 --> 01:07:51.831
Yeah, try to jump very, very high.

01:07:53.271 --> 01:07:55.136
Hey, yeah. Thanks.

01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:57.298
Good luck.

01:08:01.379 --> 01:08:03.779
Well, we're getting creamed
all over the place.

01:08:03.881 --> 01:08:05.246
<i>I'm</i> your guy.

01:08:12.223 --> 01:08:14.418
- Come on, jump!
- Over!

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.551
Hey, are you okay?

01:08:24.102 --> 01:08:26.002
Get into it! Come on, do it!

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:36.712
Just let me know
when you've had enough, all right?

01:08:38.416 --> 01:08:40.145
You're out!

01:08:51.028 --> 01:08:52.359
- All right!
- Come on, Jackie!

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:53.520
Come on!

01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:55.689
Go, go, go!

01:08:59.403 --> 01:09:02.429
- Watch out, Jackie!
- No, don't!

01:09:04.609 --> 01:09:05.837
Oh, my God!

01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:14.479
<i>She's</i> hurt. Hey, get the stretcher
from the infirmary.

01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:16.746
I think her <i>leg's</i> broken.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.970
Hey, gang, come on. Look it, just 'cause
we're losing, <i>doesn't</i> mean <i>it's</i> all over.

01:09:35.106 --> 01:09:36.334
Cut the crap, Morty.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.465
I mean, the Mohawks have beaten us
the last 12 years,

01:09:38.576 --> 01:09:39.872
they're gonna beat us again.

01:09:39.977 --> 01:09:44.243
<i>That's</i> just the attitude
we <i>don't</i> need, Phil.

01:09:45.082 --> 01:09:48.950
Sure. Mohawk has beaten us
12 years in a row.

01:09:49.086 --> 01:09:50.849
Sure, they're terrific athletes.

01:09:50.955 --> 01:09:52.718
They've got the best equipment
that money can buy.

01:09:52.823 --> 01:09:57.089
Hell, every team they're sending over
here has their own personal masseuse.

01:09:57.195 --> 01:09:59.595
Not masseur, masseuse.

01:10:00.164 --> 01:10:02.462
But it <i>doesn't</i> matter.

01:10:02.867 --> 01:10:07.270
Do you know that every Mohawk
competitor has an electrocardiogram,

01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:09.771
blood and urine tests every 48 hours,

01:10:09.874 --> 01:10:13.435
to see if <i>there's</i> any change
in his physical condition?

01:10:13.544 --> 01:10:16.104
Do you know that they use the most
sophisticated training methods

01:10:16.214 --> 01:10:18.978
from the Soviet Union,
East and West Germany,

01:10:19.116 --> 01:10:21.744
and the newest Olympic power,
Trinidad and Tobago?

01:10:21.852 --> 01:10:23.683
But it <i>doesn't</i> matter.

01:10:23.821 --> 01:10:27.814
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

01:10:27.959 --> 01:10:32.362
I tell you, it just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

01:10:32.496 --> 01:10:34.361
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

01:10:34.498 --> 01:10:38.264
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

01:10:38.369 --> 01:10:40.303
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

01:10:40.404 --> 01:10:45.034
And even...
And even if we win, if we win!

01:10:46.377 --> 01:10:48.436
Even if we win,

01:10:48.546 --> 01:10:51.208
even if we play so far over our heads

01:10:51.349 --> 01:10:54.648
that our noses bleed
for a week to ten days,

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:59.553
even if God in heaven above
comes down and points his hand

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:01.715
at our side of the field,

01:11:01.859 --> 01:11:04.555
even if every man, woman, and child

01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:09.132
held hands together
and prayed for us to win,

01:11:09.233 --> 01:11:11.531
it just <i>wouldn't</i> matter,

01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:14.832
because all the really good-Iooking girls

01:11:14.939 --> 01:11:17.271
would still go out
with the guys from Mohawk,

01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:20.037
<i>'cause they got all the money!</i>

01:11:21.445 --> 01:11:26.348
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter
if we win or we lose!

01:11:26.751 --> 01:11:29.515
It just <i>doesn't</i> matter.

01:11:29.654 --> 01:11:33.488
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

01:11:33.591 --> 01:11:36.856
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!
- It just <i>doesn't</i> matter!

01:12:01.285 --> 01:12:03.480
Starters, take your mark.

01:12:07.058 --> 01:12:10.255
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:13:07.752 --> 01:13:10.152
Okay, you guys. We got two outs,
<i>it's</i> the bottom of the ninth.

01:13:10.254 --> 01:13:12.154
Carla is our winning run
on second base.

01:13:12.256 --> 01:13:13.416
What do you think we ought to do, Trip?

01:13:13.524 --> 01:13:15.424
Well, Jody, I <i>don't</i> wanna put
any more pressure on you

01:13:15.526 --> 01:13:16.857
than is absolutely necessary,

01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:20.522
but there is a scout here today from
the New York Yankees organization,

01:13:20.631 --> 01:13:22.861
and if my ball club could win,
well, I would get a chance

01:13:22.967 --> 01:13:24.992
to coach at the professional level.

01:13:25.102 --> 01:13:28.196
Seriously, Jody. You see that girl
out there with the big boobs?

01:13:28.305 --> 01:13:31.604
- Hit the ball to her, she <i>can't</i> catch.
- No sweat.

01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:34.041
- All right. Well, <i>let's</i> go.
- Come on, Jody.

01:13:34.145 --> 01:13:36.409
All right, Jody!

01:13:46.323 --> 01:13:48.018
Double time, double time!

01:14:11.348 --> 01:14:12.679
Come on, Wheels!

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:16.711
Go!

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.432
God, you're a pitstink.

01:14:45.216 --> 01:14:46.911
Watch it, watch it.

01:14:51.021 --> 01:14:54.354
One, two, three!

01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:04.364
How could they do this to me?
I <i>can't</i> stack. I <i>can't</i> even walk.

01:15:04.468 --> 01:15:07.665
Come off it, Spaz. You can so.
I've seen you walk.

01:15:07.771 --> 01:15:11.207
Anyway, you can do anything
you want to, if you want to bad enough.

01:15:11.308 --> 01:15:14.243
Besides, I know you can.

01:15:15.379 --> 01:15:16.846
Come on.

01:15:18.582 --> 01:15:23.884
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!

01:15:33.097 --> 01:15:34.621
Stackers get ready!

01:15:34.798 --> 01:15:36.789
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!

01:15:36.901 --> 01:15:38.027
Get set!

01:15:41.171 --> 01:15:44.902
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!
- Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!

01:16:22.313 --> 01:16:23.678
Spaz!

01:16:26.784 --> 01:16:29.617
You did it! I told you!

01:16:38.062 --> 01:16:42.590
<i>That's</i> right, Fink.
Look at those steaming weenies.

01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:45.592
And you know
what they're saying, Larry?

01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:50.368
They're saying, "This is the year
that Fink beats The <i>Stomach."</i>

01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:56.202
No. <i>It's</i> a couple of guys over here,
but they're saying it.

01:16:57.314 --> 01:16:59.874
No! Save it.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.845
Save it for this guy.

01:17:31.115 --> 01:17:34.414
- What, no mustard?
- Okay, hands up.

01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:36.519
You guys know the rules.
You got five minutes.

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:40.989
Half-eaten weenies <i>don't</i> count.
May the best man win. Ready, set...

01:17:43.961 --> 01:17:46.327
You gotta want it, Fink!

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:49.991
Come on, give a hundred percent for us!
Come on!

01:17:50.934 --> 01:17:55.030
Come on, you gotta want it, Larry.
You gotta want it. This is your year.

01:17:55.139 --> 01:17:56.834
You gotta want it, Larry.

01:17:58.742 --> 01:18:02.041
Every day <i>I'm</i> eating
more and more hot dogs.

01:18:02.146 --> 01:18:05.673
Come on, pace.
Pace, baby. Left. Swallow.

01:18:05.783 --> 01:18:09.378
Right. Swallow. Fight hard, Larry!
You gotta want it!

01:18:10.721 --> 01:18:14.248
The <i>Stomach's</i> worried, Larry.
He <i>doesn't</i> want it bad enough.

01:18:15.826 --> 01:18:20.456
Come on, Fink! This is weenie war! Eat!

01:18:20.597 --> 01:18:23.532
Come on, stretch that stomach, Fink!

01:18:24.735 --> 01:18:28.193
Come on, eat, Fink, eat! Eat!

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:33.767
Please! Please, Fink, please!

01:18:34.812 --> 01:18:38.407
Larry! Larry! Come on! Eat, Fink!

01:18:38.515 --> 01:18:40.710
Eat!

01:18:45.589 --> 01:18:47.284
The winner!

01:18:53.697 --> 01:18:58.031
- Way to go, Fink.
- You beat The Stomach, Larry.

01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:03.601
All right, now, we're close,
and we could win this thing,

01:19:03.707 --> 01:19:05.197
- so <i>let's</i> get serious.
- Damn right.

01:19:05.309 --> 01:19:06.537
Now, <i>there's</i> only one event left,

01:19:06.643 --> 01:19:09.339
<i>it's</i> a four-mile marathon,
<i>it's</i> worth 20 points.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.574
Unfortunately, our best distance runner,
Jackie, broke her ankle.

01:19:12.683 --> 01:19:14.446
You jerk.

01:19:14.551 --> 01:19:17.884
So, we need a distance man.
Any ideas?

01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:19.818
- You, buddy.
- Oh, <i>don't</i> look at me.

01:19:19.923 --> 01:19:22.016
<i>I'd</i> be puking after the first mile.

01:19:22.159 --> 01:19:24.753
- Well, <i>somebody's</i> gotta do it.
- <i>Finkelstein's</i> your man, sir.

01:19:24.862 --> 01:19:27.854
- Larry Finkelstein.
- Yeah!

01:19:29.433 --> 01:19:32.630
- <i>Here's</i> your man.
- Come on, Tripper. No!

01:19:32.736 --> 01:19:36.172
- Where?
- Right here. Rudy Gerner.

01:19:36.673 --> 01:19:38.163
Please don't.

01:19:38.275 --> 01:19:40.368
- <i>He's</i> the best we got.
- Get serious.

01:19:40.511 --> 01:19:43.480
I mean, no offense, Tripper,
but that kid <i>can't</i> even catch a football.

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.445
Well, for your information, Phillip,

01:19:45.549 --> 01:19:49.883
Rudy is a three-time Junior State
Long-Distance Medal Award Winner.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.988
- Bullshit!
- And he won

01:19:52.089 --> 01:19:55.718
a presidential citation from
his Committee on Physical Fitness.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.328
- <i>He's</i> lying to me. I know it, <i>he's</i> lying.
- Come on.

01:19:58.428 --> 01:20:01.864
- I <i>can't</i> do it, Tripper.
- Yeah, you can. Believe me.

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:04.456
Morty, give him a chance.
No one else wants to...

01:20:04.568 --> 01:20:07.230
Come on, Morty! Make up your mind!

01:20:07.371 --> 01:20:10.033
Yeah, come on, Morty,
for once make a decision.

01:20:11.642 --> 01:20:14.167
All right! Gerner runs the marathon.

01:20:17.915 --> 01:20:20.713
What do you think our chances are?

01:20:21.218 --> 01:20:25.245
- I hope I <i>don't</i> let you down, Tripper.
- You won't.

01:20:25.556 --> 01:20:28.286
<i>Let's</i> go get laid before the race, huh?

01:20:33.063 --> 01:20:34.690
- <i>How's</i> the leg?
- <i>It's</i> okay.

01:20:34.798 --> 01:20:36.789
Yeah, for now,
but if you <i>don't</i> win, we cut it off.

01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:39.130
Okay, <i>here's</i> the thing.

01:20:39.403 --> 01:20:41.667
On open ground,
this guy could probably take you,

01:20:41.772 --> 01:20:43.501
but you're running through the woods,
you got a chance.

01:20:43.607 --> 01:20:45.802
You're smaller, and you can run
through the bushes a little faster.

01:20:45.909 --> 01:20:48.275
You can duck underneath them,
you know, you're like a little rabbit.

01:20:48.378 --> 01:20:49.606
Okay? You're Rudy Rabbit, okay?

01:20:49.713 --> 01:20:52.341
When you're running, think,
<i>"I'm</i> Rudy the <i>Rabbit",</i> okay?

01:20:52.449 --> 01:20:54.679
Stay with him, stay right behind him,
until you get to the woods.

01:20:54.785 --> 01:20:56.844
When you get to the woods,
pass him, just fly by him.

01:20:56.954 --> 01:20:59.013
<i>Don't</i> even look in the rear-view mirror.
Just move, move, move!

01:20:59.122 --> 01:21:01.352
You gotta be way ahead of him
when you get to the edge of the woods,

01:21:01.458 --> 01:21:03.392
<i>'cause when you get out,
<i>there's</i> a half a mile of open ground,</i>

01:21:03.493 --> 01:21:04.983
and <i>that's</i> where you're gonna have
a lot of trouble.

01:21:05.095 --> 01:21:07.393
You gotta have a hell of a lead
when you get out of the woods, okay?

01:21:07.497 --> 01:21:09.260
All right, <i>what's</i> your name?

01:21:09.399 --> 01:21:10.696
- Rudy Gerner.
- No, <i>it's</i> not.

01:21:10.801 --> 01:21:12.200
<i>It's</i> Rudy the Rabbit, okay?
Rudy the Rabbit!

01:21:12.302 --> 01:21:13.564
- <i>What's</i> your name?
- Rudy the Rabbit.

01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:16.867
Rudy the Rabbit, the winner.
You're the winner, Rudy the Rabbit.

01:21:16.974 --> 01:21:19.738
<i>Let's</i> hear it for him.

01:21:25.983 --> 01:21:27.382
All right, come on.

01:21:27.484 --> 01:21:30.578
Runners take your mark!

01:21:31.755 --> 01:21:33.313
Get set!

01:21:36.493 --> 01:21:40.623
Run, you rascal rabbit! Run!

01:23:57.834 --> 01:24:00.769
My God, <i>he's</i> sprinting!

01:24:48.985 --> 01:24:52.648
- Bye-bye, Rudy. You did real good.
- Thanks.

01:24:52.789 --> 01:24:55.986
- You coming back next year?
- Yeah, for sure.

01:24:56.126 --> 01:24:58.822
Well, stay in shape.
Get on a weight program.

01:24:58.962 --> 01:25:00.452
Stop hanging around
with all those friends of yours,

01:25:00.564 --> 01:25:02.589
they're a bad influence.

01:25:02.699 --> 01:25:05.361
Thanks, Tripper, for everything.

01:25:06.136 --> 01:25:07.967
Goodbye, champ.

01:25:11.007 --> 01:25:13.441
Go to bed! Yeah.

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:18.841
Hey, look! <i>There's</i> Gerner!

01:25:23.253 --> 01:25:27.314
- You wanna go to the final campfire?
- All right.

01:25:29.493 --> 01:25:31.222
If I have to.

01:25:36.399 --> 01:25:38.230
- Hey, Tripper.
- Hey, you guys.

01:25:38.335 --> 01:25:39.359
Hey, Trip.

01:25:39.503 --> 01:25:40.993
Hi.

01:25:43.707 --> 01:25:45.140
Eddy.

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:48.575
I just wanna say thank you.

01:25:48.712 --> 01:25:51.180
You've all been
a really terrific bunch of CITs,

01:25:51.281 --> 01:25:53.977
and we've had...
All had a terrific summer,

01:25:54.718 --> 01:25:58.586
except for a few minor incidents
that I <i>don't</i> wanna go into right now.

01:25:58.722 --> 01:26:02.351
But, through it all, we share things,
and we become closer,

01:26:02.459 --> 01:26:05.223
and that even makes it harder
to say goodbye,

01:26:05.362 --> 01:26:07.023
but I hope you've learned a lot of things,

01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:10.065
I know I have, and I... I just wanna say,

01:26:11.635 --> 01:26:14.001
I hope to see you all
again next summer.

01:26:14.104 --> 01:26:16.299
Can I have some applause
for this man, please?

01:26:16.406 --> 01:26:17.634
- All right!
- Come on!

01:26:17.741 --> 01:26:19.902
Hey! Way to go, Mickey!

01:26:20.577 --> 01:26:22.511
<i>Let's</i> hear it for Mickey!

01:26:22.779 --> 01:26:24.679
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:26:25.482 --> 01:26:27.074
- All right.
- Oh, lovely!

01:26:30.587 --> 01:26:34.216
- Can you get this?
- No.

01:26:34.324 --> 01:26:36.121
Yeah, well, <i>I'm</i> very close.

01:26:36.259 --> 01:26:37.726
- Are you close?
- No.

01:26:37.827 --> 01:26:39.055
I <i>can't</i> hold it.

01:26:39.162 --> 01:26:43.462
I <i>can't</i> hold it any longer!
Stick your finger in my ear!

01:26:44.234 --> 01:26:45.565
Help!

01:26:50.807 --> 01:26:53.571
Hey, save enough for us, Tripper.

01:26:53.843 --> 01:26:55.105
Morty.

01:26:55.245 --> 01:26:56.803
No hard feelings?

01:27:04.421 --> 01:27:11.054
<i>We are the CITs, so pity us</i>

01:27:11.161 --> 01:27:17.259
<i>The kids are brats, the food is hideous</i>

01:27:18.134 --> 01:27:23.766
<i>We're gonna smoke and drink</i>
<i>and fool around</i>

01:27:24.174 --> 01:27:26.608
<i>We're nookie bound</i>

01:27:27.844 --> 01:27:34.010
<i>We're the North Star CITs</i>

01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:38.746
<i>We are the CITs, so pity us</i>

01:27:38.888 --> 01:27:42.756
<i>The kids are brats, the food is hideous</i>

01:27:42.859 --> 01:27:46.522
<i>We're gonna smoke and drink</i>
<i>and fool around</i>

01:27:46.663 --> 01:27:49.689
<i>We're nookie bound</i>
<i>We're North Star CITs</i>

01:27:49.833 --> 01:27:51.095
Here we go!

01:27:51.201 --> 01:27:53.795
<i>We are the CITs, so pity us</i>

01:27:53.903 --> 01:27:57.202
<i>The kids are brats, the food is hideous</i>

01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:00.104
<i>We're gonna smoke and drink</i>
<i>and fool around</i>

01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:03.646
<i>We're nookie bound</i>
<i>We're North Star CITs</i>

01:28:05.015 --> 01:28:11.511
<i>We're the North Star CITs</i>

01:28:22.399 --> 01:28:23.991
Here we go, you guys! <i>Let's</i> go!

01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.658
End of the summer. You happy?

01:28:25.769 --> 01:28:27.964
- You ready?
- Okay. Okay.

01:28:28.071 --> 01:28:30.369
- There we are.
- Everybody there?

01:28:40.216 --> 01:28:43.515
- Where will I stay?
- My place. Where do you think?

01:28:44.554 --> 01:28:48.081
- Is it big enough?
- <i>It's</i> got a double bed.

01:28:48.391 --> 01:28:51.827
<i>What's</i> the matter with you? <i>Haven't</i> you
ever lived with anyone before?

01:28:51.928 --> 01:28:54.556
No. Have you?

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:02.030
Pets, you know, a dog, a fish.
No, I haven't.

01:29:03.373 --> 01:29:05.500
I've never asked anyone before.

01:29:18.221 --> 01:29:19.620
Come on,
<i>let's</i> go say good bye to Morty.

01:29:19.723 --> 01:29:21.452
Oh, no.

01:29:28.465 --> 01:29:30.865
- Bye, Morty.
- Bye, Morty.

01:29:33.303 --> 01:29:35.237
Have a nice winter.

01:29:58.762 --> 01:30:01.959
My <i>father's</i> buying a camp next year.
You wanna go up?

01:30:02.132 --> 01:30:06.501
No. I <i>don't</i> think so. I...
I kind of like it here.

01:30:07.103 --> 01:30:08.127
Oh.

01:30:43.306 --> 01:30:46.833
Camp

01:30:48.011 --> 01:30:51.811
ho!

01:32:18.935 --> 01:32:20.960
Tripper!

01:32:23.106 --> 01:32:25.233
Somebody!

01:33:18.161 --> 01:33:19.753
Somebody!
