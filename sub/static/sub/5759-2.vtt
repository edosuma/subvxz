WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:02.529
Man:
WE'RE NOT DONE HERE!

00:02.570 --> 00:03.798
Previously on
Pretty Little Liars:

00:03.830 --> 00:06.196
KEEP PUSHING.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.593
TOLD YOU IT WOULD SINK.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.608
ARE YOU CURRENTLY
SEEING EZRA FITZ?

00:09.640 --> 00:10.402
NO, I'M NOT.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.408
THIS MIGHT BE BIGGER
THAN MONA, OKAY?

00:12.440 --> 00:14.806
SHE COULD BE WORKING
FOR SOMEONE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS?

00:14.840 --> 00:16.239
'CAUSE I WAS BEING
PROTECTIVE.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.577
ARE YOU IMMEDIATE FAMILY?

00:17.610 --> 00:18.702
UMM, NO.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.570
THEN YOU NEED
TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.282
THOSE BITCHES ARE FINALLY
GOING TO GET WHAT THEY DESERVE.

00:28.790 --> 00:30.428
YOU LET ME BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE DEAD?

00:30.460 --> 00:32.223
SO I COULD PROTECT YOU.

00:32.260 --> 00:34.228
THERE NEVER WAS
A HAPPY ENDING FOR US.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.397
BYE, EZRA.

00:35.430 --> 00:36.795
THOSE BITCHES ARE
GOING TO BE AT
THE LODGE AT NINE.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.229
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:38.270 --> 00:40.636
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

00:43.140 --> 00:44.266
ELLIE?

00:46.510 --> 00:47.807
COULD ANYONE SEE HER?

00:47.840 --> 00:48.807
SEE WHO?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.273
ALISON.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.547
IS THAT--
SOMEBODY PULLED IT

00:52.580 --> 00:53.547
OUT OF THE LAKE.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.275
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

00:55.320 --> 00:56.719
WE HAVE TO GET THIS
OUT OF HERE.

00:57.720 --> 00:58.812
( phones beeping )

00:58.850 --> 01:00.283
Emily:
YOU'RE MINE NOW.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.129
KISSES...
"A."

01:09.170 --> 01:10.296
( sharp intake of breath )

01:11.300 --> 01:12.289
( sighing )

01:13.540 --> 01:14.632
Aria:
WHAT THE...

01:20.810 --> 01:21.799
WHERE'S MONA?

01:23.280 --> 01:24.702
THIS WAS ALL HER.
SHE SET US UP.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.411
OKAY, LET'S GO.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

01:26.450 --> 01:27.644
COME ON.

01:33.820 --> 01:35.651
Spencer:
HANNA!
HANNA, LET'S GO!

01:35.690 --> 01:37.328
GOD, MONA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:37.360 --> 01:38.679
SAVING YOUR MOM.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.458
GUYS.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.660
SOMEONE'S COMING.

01:46.700 --> 01:47.894
HEY, THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.669
HURRY UP!

01:49.710 --> 01:51.735
Hanna: MONA!
THEY'RE COMING MONA, COME ON.

01:51.770 --> 01:54.603
HANNAH, WE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.
SERIOUSLY, COME ON.

01:54.640 --> 01:55.800
COME ON!

01:59.220 --> 02:01.313
MONA, COME ON.
WE HAVE TO GO.

02:04.650 --> 02:05.878
MONA!

02:05.920 --> 02:07.808
HURRY UP!

02:10.790 --> 02:12.394
GOT IT.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.799
COME ON!

02:20.770 --> 02:23.568
( television indistinct)

02:23.610 --> 02:26.602
THERE'S A REPORT ON THE LODGE,
BUT NOTHING ABOUT WILDEN'S CAR.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.205
WELL, I GUESS THE FIRE
TRUMPS A DEAD PIG.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.411
YOU CAN STOP STARING
OUT THE WINDOW, ARIA.

02:32.450 --> 02:35.169
THE COPS AREN'T
COMING TO ARREST US.

02:35.220 --> 02:37.814
I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL SAFE
JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY

02:37.850 --> 02:40.250
IT'S ALL OKAY NOW?
AFI'ER EVERYTHING YOU'VE

02:40.290 --> 02:41.484
PUT US THROUGH.
DO YOU THINK WE'D

02:41.520 --> 02:43.226
BE SITTING HERE
IF ANYONE SAW US?

02:43.260 --> 02:45.455
WANNA KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK YOU'RE LUCKY THAT

02:45.490 --> 02:47.720
WE'RE NOT BEATING
THE CRAP OUT OF YOU.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.365
AND I BELIEVE YOU COULD,
EMILY.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.288
YOU REALLY WERE
THE WEAKEST LINK.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.404
BUT LOOK HOW STRONG I MADE YOU.
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.567
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

02:58.610 --> 02:59.372
Hanna:
EM!

02:59.410 --> 03:00.707
YOU KNOW WE ALL WANT
TO TAKE A TURN.

03:00.740 --> 03:03.504
BUT WE WON'T.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.574
YOU LIKE GAMES,
RIGHT, MONA?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.747
SO, LET'S PLAY
ONE CALLED THE THIRD DEGREE.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.752
HOW DID YOU GET
THE CAR OUT OF THE LAKE?

03:14.760 --> 03:16.955
I DIDN'T.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.753
I PUT THE CAR
IN HANNA'S GARAGE,

03:18.790 --> 03:20.849
AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
I SAW IT.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.498
SHANA KNEW JENNA BEFORE
SHE CAME TO ROSEWOOD.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.599
I THINK SHE'S
IN LOVE WITH HER.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.858
THEY'RE BOTH AFRAID
OF MELISSA.

03:34.810 --> 03:37.745
WHEN CECE CAME TO RADLEY,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS ALI.

03:37.780 --> 03:40.317
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.545
IT WAS BEFORE
THEY CHANGED MY MEDS.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.417
LUCAS GAVE EMILY THAT MASSAGE.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.416
HE SAID YOU WERE TENSE.

03:48.460 --> 03:51.349
I RECRUITED TOBY WHEN
HE GOT THAT JOB IN BUCKS COUNTY.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.666
I DIDN'T PUSH IAN
OFF THE BELL TOWER.

03:58.770 --> 04:00.294
I WISH I KNEW WHO DID.

04:07.340 --> 04:09.342
( birds chirping )

04:18.020 --> 04:19.385
( dog barking )

04:19.420 --> 04:21.285
MONA'S GONE!

04:27.330 --> 04:28.888
I DON'T REMEMBER
FALLING ASLEEP.

04:28.930 --> 04:30.488
DID SHE DRUG US?

04:30.530 --> 04:32.020
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.

04:32.070 --> 04:33.799
YOU GUYS,
SHE STILL HAS THAT CHIP.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.643
OH, EMILY,
I BORROWED YOUR CAR.

04:49.820 --> 04:52.288
YEAH, I HAVE MY OWN SET.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.785
WHERE'D YOU GO?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.525
COFFEE RUN.
DUH.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.528
WHERE ELSE DID YOU GO?

05:01.560 --> 05:04.859
AMERICANO, ONE PINK.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.937
DRY SOY CAP.

05:07.970 --> 05:11.531
SUPER-SIZED DRIP,
WITH THREE SUGARS.

05:11.570 --> 05:14.073
AND A SKINNY VANILLA FOR YOU.

05:14.110 --> 05:15.975
DID I GET IT RIGHT?

05:17.110 --> 05:20.409
I WANT THE CHIP, MONA.
AND I WANT IT NOW.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.839
AND I ALSO GOT BREAKFAST.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.949
MULTIGRAIN SCONE.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD

05:24.990 --> 05:25.843
TO PLAY ROOM SERVICE.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.755
I WISH I COULD GIVE
IT TO YOU, HANNA.

05:27.790 --> 05:29.621
BUT I CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

05:29.660 --> 05:32.697
I NEED TO FIND OUT WHO RED COAT
IS AND SO DO YOU.

05:32.730 --> 05:34.527
SHE TRIED TO KILL ALL OF US,
$0, LIKE IT OR NOT,

05:34.560 --> 05:36.096
WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER.

05:36.130 --> 05:36.994
OKAY, PROVE IT.

05:37.030 --> 05:39.396
YEAH, WE WANT EVERYTHING
YOU'VE HAVE ON US.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.862
NOW.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.702
MI CASA ES SU CASA.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.446
IN ENGLISH.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.611
SHE'S TAKING US TO HER LAIR.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.382
( indistinct chatter )

06:04.190 --> 06:07.751
ALL THIS FOR
A MUDDY COP CAR
AND A DEAD PIG?

06:09.530 --> 06:12.124
( horns honking )

06:19.940 --> 06:21.077
IT'S WILDEN.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.458
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT'S *

06:33.490 --> 06:35.788
* WHERE THIS ONE
YOU SAVE *

06:35.820 --> 06:37.788
* GOT A LOCKET,
IN YOUR POCKET *

06:37.830 --> 06:40.628
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

06:40.660 --> 06:43.197
* EVER SHOW YOU
THAT I KNOW YOU *

06:43.230 --> 06:45.494
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

06:45.530 --> 06:48.090
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET

06:48.140 --> 06:50.802
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

06:53.210 --> 06:54.905
( indistinct chatter )

06:58.910 --> 07:00.070
( horn honking )

07:00.120 --> 07:01.747
OH, MY GOD.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.509
"YOU'RE MINE NOW."

07:03.550 --> 07:05.438
I KNOW WHAT THE TEXT MEANT.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.549
"A" HAS A WAY TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE WE KILLED HIM.

07:09.590 --> 07:11.626
( pounding )

07:19.030 --> 07:21.533
( morose, heaw
rock playing )

07:21.570 --> 07:28.874
* THE STREETS
A LIAR *

07:28.910 --> 07:32.971
* I'M GONNA LURE YOU
INTO THE DARK *

07:33.020 --> 07:36.683
* MY COLD DESIRE

07:36.720 --> 07:40.656
* TO GET A BOOM, BOOM, BOOM
OF YOUR HEART *

07:40.690 --> 07:44.626
* THE DANGER IS
I'M DANGEROUS *

07:44.660 --> 07:47.220
* AND I MIGHT JUST
TEAR YOU APART *

07:47.260 --> 07:52.698
*OH

07:52.740 --> 07:54.833
* I'M GONNA CATCH YA

07:54.870 --> 07:57.566
* I'M GONNA GET CHA
GET CHA *

07:57.610 --> 07:59.703
*OH

07:59.740 --> 08:04.074
* I WANT TO TASTE THE WAY
THAT YOU BLEED *

08:04.110 --> 08:07.773
*OH

08:07.820 --> 08:10.709
IF RED COAT'S "A," WHY DID
SHE SAVE US FROM THE FIRE?

08:10.750 --> 08:13.287
SO SHE COULD SET US UP TO TAKE
THE FALL FOR WILDEN'S MURDER.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.208
YEAH, A CAT PLAYS
WITH A MOUSE FOR HOURS

08:15.260 --> 08:17.581
BEFORE SHE ACTUALLY EATS IT.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.791
ONCE IT'S DEAD,
THE FUN'S OVER.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.991
SO WE'RE ALI'S MICE?

08:23.030 --> 08:24.827
WE'RE HER DOLLS.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.929
GUYS, ALISON ISN'T PLAYING
WITH US, OKAY?

08:26.970 --> 08:28.631
SHE'S DEAD.

08:31.170 --> 08:35.209
* THIS IS A BAD TOWN
FOR A SUCH A PRETTY FACE *

08:35.240 --> 08:37.970
YOU WERE ON THE HALLOWEEN TRAIN.
DRESSED LIKE CALEB.

08:38.010 --> 08:40.808
TO THINK WE WERE THIS CLOSE
TO OUR FIRST KISS.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.249
AND TO GETTING
RID OF ME FOR GOOD.

08:42.280 --> 08:45.010
THAT WASN'T ME.
AND I CAN PROVE IT.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.023
WHEN I TOOK THIS,
YOU WERE ALREADY IN THE BOX.

08:51.060 --> 08:53.221
AND THESE TWO PUT
YOU IN THERE.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.727
ITS NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

08:58.770 --> 09:00.032
THAT'S WILDEN.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.162
LISTEN TO ME.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.758
Emily:
HE WAS THE QUEEN OF HEARTS?

09:02.810 --> 09:06.109
JUST LEAVE HER.
PLANS HAVE CHANGED.

09:06.140 --> 09:07.778
GARRETT'S GOING TO TELL
THEM EVERYTHING.

09:07.810 --> 09:09.641
THERE'S TWO OF THEM?

09:09.680 --> 09:11.079
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

09:11.110 --> 09:12.145
WHO'S THAT?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.308
YOUR SISTER.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.156
OH, YEAH, THAT'S CONVENIENT.
RIGHT BEFORE YOU COULD PROVE IT.

09:24.190 --> 09:25.179
WAIT, MONA,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:25.230 --> 09:26.857
SOMEONE'S DELETING
ALL MY FILES!

09:26.900 --> 09:27.924
Spencer:
MONA, SHUT IT DOWN!

09:27.960 --> 09:29.052
I'M TRYING TO.

09:34.870 --> 09:38.067
Little girl:
ALISON? FASTER.

09:38.110 --> 09:42.001
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.940
( laughter )

09:45.310 --> 09:49.019
IT'S NOT FAIR, ARIA.
IT WAS EMILY'S IDEA.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.057
( laughter )

10:07.140 --> 10:09.700
FASTER, FASTER!

10:17.750 --> 10:18.808
HEY, THERE!

10:20.420 --> 10:21.739
HI.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.848
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE DOLLS?

10:25.890 --> 10:29.087
THEY WERE A PRESENT.
MINE'S NAME IS ARIA.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.352
AND THAT'S HANNA, SPENCER,
EMILY, AND MONA.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.064
WHO GAVE THEM TO YOU?

10:38.100 --> 10:41.263
YOUR FRIEND, ALISON.
SHE STARTED PLAYING WITH US

10:41.300 --> 10:43.109
RIGHT AFTER YOU MOVED IN.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.456
YEAH, WHATEVER YOU NEED.

11:02.490 --> 11:04.082
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE THERE.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.859
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.967
WAS THAT CALEB? IS HE BACK?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.663
NO. IT WAS MONA.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.700
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THAT SHE NEEDS?

11:17.740 --> 11:20.937
SHE JUST WANTS TO MOVE
THE RV UNTIL WE CAN ALL
GET RID OF IT TOGETHER.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.800
I'M DRIVING HER THERE.

11:22.850 --> 11:26.206
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
LAST NIGHT,
AND MONA PUT HER GLOVES

11:26.250 --> 11:27.945
ON BEFORE SHE TOUCHED
WILDEN'S CAR.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.413
MEANWHILE, OUR PRINTS
ARE ALL OVER IT.

11:29.450 --> 11:32.146
SHE'S LIKE
HANNIBAL LECT OR SMART.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.885
SHE'S BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.854
WHO'S TO SAY THAT SHE'S
NOT STILL DOING IT?

11:35.890 --> 11:39.018
EM, YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT IF I'VE LEARNED
FROM MY MOM,

11:39.060 --> 11:41.790
IT'S KEEP YOUR FRIENDS
CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.388
SO, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE HER NEW BFF?

11:43.430 --> 11:45.466
IF THAT'S WHAT IT
TAKES TO GET THAT CHIP.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.899
( knocking )

11:46.940 --> 11:49.238
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE AT WORK.

11:49.270 --> 11:51.067
NOBODY'S GETTING ANYTHING
DONE TODAY.

11:51.110 --> 11:54.079
ALL ANYONE CAN THINK
ABOUT IS POOR WILDEN.

11:54.110 --> 11:55.930
DO THEY KNOW WHO DID IT?

11:55.980 --> 11:59.347
NO, BUT THERE ARE WITNESSES.

11:59.380 --> 12:02.110
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY
WHAT THEY SAW, BUT...

12:05.050 --> 12:08.952
YOU DOING OKAY, HANNA?
I'M SORRY I HAD TO LEAVE
SO EARLY THIS MORNING.

12:08.990 --> 12:11.322
WE REALLY DIDN'T GET
A CHANCE TO TALK.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.827
WHO'S THAT FOR?

12:12.860 --> 12:14.327
JESSICA DILAU RENTIS.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.396
SHE STOPPED BY THE POLICE
STATION THIS MORNING.

12:16.430 --> 12:18.967
SHE'S MOVING BACK.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.089
YEAH.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.301
JASON MADE IT SEEM LIKE
SHE HATED IT HERE.

12:24.340 --> 12:26.365
HE SAID THAT SHE
COULDN'T FACE ALL
THE MEMORIES OF ALISON.

12:26.410 --> 12:28.105
WELL, SOMETHING
MUST HAVE CHANGED.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.949
I MEAN, IN SPITE
OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON

12:29.980 --> 12:33.313
WITH WILDEN, SHE SEEMS
TO BE IN A PRETTY GOOD PLACE.

12:33.350 --> 12:34.374
( phone ringing )

12:34.420 --> 12:35.648
THAT'S PROBABLY YOUR DAD.

12:38.890 --> 12:42.018
MAYBE MRS. D ISN'T
SO SAD ANYMORE BECAUSE
SHE KNOWS WHAT WE KNOW.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.129
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,
HANNA.

12:43.160 --> 12:47.290
I SAW WHO PULLED US OUT OF
THE FIRE, EM. IT WAS ALISON.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.365
SO...

12:59.410 --> 13:01.230
HE THREW IT ON THIS PILE.

13:03.410 --> 13:04.877
I'M SURE OF IT.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.911
YOU THINK THEY LEFT
ANYTHING INSIDE?

13:11.950 --> 13:13.952
HEY, IT'S NOT SAFE
TO GO IN THERE.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.110
Toby:
SPENCER?

13:51.090 --> 13:52.455
SPENCE?

13:52.490 --> 13:54.048
WHAT?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.360
WE SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE.

13:58.400 --> 14:02.359
WELL, WE ARE.
SO, WE MIGHT AS WELL LOOK.

14:05.910 --> 14:07.537
Toby:
AND WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.138
RED COAT.

14:09.180 --> 14:12.104
( sighs )
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S IN HERE.

14:16.280 --> 14:19.215
WHAT IF IT WAS ALI?

14:19.250 --> 14:21.559
AND WHAT IF SHE BROUGHT
US HERE BECAUSE...

14:21.590 --> 14:25.219
SHE'S READY TO COME HOME.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.990
SHE PULLS EVERYBODY OUT
AND THEN TAKES OFF?

14:28.030 --> 14:30.328
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
IT ISN'T SAFE?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.928
IT'S POSSIBLE.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.494
WELL, YEAH, IF YOU'RE NOT TAKING
INTO ACCOUNT THAT

14:33.540 --> 14:37.931
SHE DIED TWO YEARS AGO.
SURE, IT'S POSSIBLE.

14:40.540 --> 14:41.905
( floor creaks )

14:41.940 --> 14:43.976
TO BY?

14:44.010 --> 14:46.046
I DON'T THINK WE'RE
IN HERE ALONE.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.154
( bird crowing )

15:16.580 --> 15:19.549
(toy drumming )

15:19.580 --> 15:21.468
EMILY?

15:21.520 --> 15:25.240
IT FEELS LIKE HOME WHEN
YOU SEE A FRIENDLY FACE.

15:25.290 --> 15:27.178
HI.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.229
UH, THIS IS FOR YOU.
IT'S FROM MY MOM.

15:31.260 --> 15:35.048
TELL HER I SAID THANK YOU
AND I LOOK FORWARD
TO HAVING HER OVER FOR TEA

15:35.100 --> 15:37.967
AS SOON AS I'M SETTLED IN.
I WILL.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.297
IS JASON BACK, TOO?

15:39.330 --> 15:42.128
HE'S DOWN SOUTH.
RENOVATING GRANDMA D'S PLACE.

15:42.170 --> 15:45.708
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE,
BUT SHE LET THINGS GO.

15:45.740 --> 15:47.537
AND IT SMELLS
LIKE OLD PEOPLE.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.970
( laughs )
ALI HATED THAT SMELL.

15:51.010 --> 15:54.047
IT'S GOOD TO HEAR
SOMEONE SAY HER NAME.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.015
PEOPLE AVOID IT.
THEY'RE TRYING TO BE POLITE.

15:57.050 --> 16:00.486
BUT IT'S NOT NICE.
IT'S WEAK.

16:02.060 --> 16:04.654
NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S FRAGILE.
I'LL MOVE THOSE.

16:06.230 --> 16:08.755
EMILY, WOULD YOU MIND
HELPING WITH THESE?

16:08.800 --> 16:10.392
SURE.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.303
CAN YOU SET THAT
ON THE BED?

16:28.250 --> 16:30.616
YOU KEPT ALL OF HER THINGS?

16:32.090 --> 16:34.411
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.092
Emily: SHE'S BUILDING
A SHRINE TO ALI.

16:42.130 --> 16:45.361
OR ALI WANTS
HER OLD ROOM BACK.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.699
I KNOW HOW REAL IT FEELS
WHEN YOU THINK YOU SEE HER.

16:48.740 --> 16:51.163
MAYBE THAT'S JUST
BECAUSE NONE OF US

16:51.210 --> 16:52.404
WANT TO LET GO OF HER.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.670
IMAGINE HOW MRS. D.
MUST FEEL.

16:54.710 --> 16:57.372
I THINK WE'RE HERE.

16:57.410 --> 16:58.342
WHERE'S HERE?

16:58.380 --> 17:01.645
SOME CREEPY FARM IN
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.386
OKAY. BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

17:03.420 --> 17:06.617
IF I'M NOT BACK BY MIDNIGHT,
SEND A SEARCH PARTY.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.391
THANKS FOR HELPING ME.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.632
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER NOW,
RIGHT?

17:26.670 --> 17:29.036
KIND OF LIKE OLD TIMES.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.811
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.815
ARE YOU SURE IT'S
SAFE IN HERE?

17:37.850 --> 17:42.219
YEAH. I MEAN, IT'LL BE FINE
FOR A FEW DAYS.

17:46.730 --> 17:51.292
YOU KNOW, THERE'S STUFF
IN THERE THAT CAN
BRING US ALL DOWN.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.497
WHAT?

17:54.540 --> 17:59.500
I JUST HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT YOU AND ME AS
AN "US" FOR A LONG TIME.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.802
WELL, ANYWAY. ..

18:15.360 --> 18:18.420
HI, I'LL GET
A CAPPUCCINO, PLEASE.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.590
ARIA?

18:30.510 --> 18:33.604
( sighs )

18:33.640 --> 18:35.733
YOU KNOW, I COULD PRETEND
LIKE I DIDN'T SEE YOU,

18:35.780 --> 18:38.499
BUT I DON'T WANT TO LIE.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.347
THIS IS NEW TERRITORY FOR US.
WHAT--WHAT DO I DO?

18:40.380 --> 18:42.268
DO I SAY "HI" TO YOU?
DO I AVOID YOU?

18:42.320 --> 18:44.447
WELL, I'M SAYING "HI."

18:44.490 --> 18:45.741
( both laughing )

18:50.260 --> 18:53.559
WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE A COFFEE TOGETHER
THOUGH, RIGHT?

18:53.600 --> 18:57.297
YEAH, YESTERDAY
I MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT
THAT WOULD BE OKAY.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.366
WHY NOT TONIGHT?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.698
I GOT OFFERED
A PERMANENT JOB.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.230
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.602
I HAVEN'T SAID YES YET
BECAUSE IT'S AT ROSEWOOD.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.870
EZRA, YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT
EASIER TO NOT SEE YOU WHEN
I'M ACTUALLY NOT SEEING YOU.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.646
I REALLY NEED THIS.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.341
I HAVE A FAMILY NOW.

19:17.690 --> 19:21.148
I KNOW. I UNDERSTAND.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.651
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE
OTHER PEOPLE...

19:26.690 --> 19:30.296
SOMETIMES THAT'S
THE BEST WAY TO MOVE ON.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.218
I'M NOT READY FOR THAT.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.430
( door opening )

19:33.470 --> 19:35.734
( indistinct conversation )

19:38.310 --> 19:39.436
BYE, MR. FITZ.

19:50.350 --> 19:53.353
Spencer:
HE WAS SHOT
MULTIPLE TIMES.

19:53.390 --> 19:55.415
AND THE PLACE THAT
HE WAS KILLED WAS
A DIFFERENT LOCATION

19:55.460 --> 19:57.428
THAN WHERE
THE BODY WAS FOUND.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.348
SAYS THAT TIME OF DEATH--
THANK YOU--

19:59.390 --> 20:01.824
WAS BETWEEN TEN
AND MIDNIGHT.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.293
WHICH IS WHEN WE
WERE AT THE LODGE.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.969
SO, WE CAN'T USE
THAT AS AN ALIBI.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.228
EAT.

20:07.270 --> 20:09.693
AND "A" KNOWS THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE
OUT FIRE WAS ARSON.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.334
AND WHO WOULD BELIEVE
THAT WE WERE THERE
AND WE DIDN'T START IT?

20:12.370 --> 20:15.407
YOU SEE THIS?
IT'S A FORK.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.577
YOU CAN USE IT
TO EAT THE BREAKFAST

20:16.610 --> 20:18.840
YOUR BOYFRIEND
JUST COOKED FOR YOU.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.973
I LOVE THE WAY
THAT SOUNDS.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.511
YOU CALLING YOURSELF
MY BOYFRIEND.

20:23.550 --> 20:26.212
EAT.
( laughing )
I AM.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.915
THIS IS PERFECT.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.781
NOT JUST THE FOOD.
YOU BEING HERE.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.960
IS THERE ANY MORE COFFEE?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.367
( SIGHS )
IT GOES AGAINST
MY BETTER JUDGMENT,

20:41.400 --> 20:43.459
BUT THIS IS YOUR LAST CUP,
OKAY?
PROMISE.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.501
ALL RIGHT.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.714
SO, WHAT DOES "A" HAVE ON US?

20:53.750 --> 20:55.570
( phone ringing )

21:00.360 --> 21:03.727
GOING THROUGH
WITHDRAWALS OVER HERE.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.489
TOBES?

21:05.530 --> 21:07.293
HEY, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

21:07.330 --> 21:09.423
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
IT WAS JUST A LEAD
ON A NEW JOB.

21:12.930 --> 21:15.330
THANK YOU FOR BREAKFAST...

21:15.370 --> 21:17.258
BOYFRIEN D.

21:27.350 --> 21:29.648
PAIGE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT WILDEN YET.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.716
NOT SURE HOW MUCH
TO TELL HER.

21:34.860 --> 21:35.884
ARIA?

21:35.920 --> 21:39.651
DO YOU BELIEVE IN THAT FOUR
SEASONS OF GRIEF THEORY?

21:39.690 --> 21:41.351
THAT YOU HAVE TO LIVE
THROUGH A YEAR
OF EVERYTHING,

21:41.400 --> 21:43.322
BEFORE YOU CAN REALLY
GET OVER SOMEONE.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.498
YOU GUYS HAVE
SURVIVED SO MUCH.

21:46.530 --> 21:48.088
CAN'T YOU JUST WAIT IT OUT
FOR A FEW MONTHS?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.802
JUST FEELS LIKE WE'RE BACK
WHERE WE STARTED.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.034
AND WE CAN'T GO BACK
TO WHERE WE WERE.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.937
THERE'S TOO MUCH
AT STAKE NOW.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.471
YOU KNOW I TOTALLY SUPPORT
YOU AND EZRA TOGETHER,

21:57.510 --> 21:59.375
BUT MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

21:59.410 --> 22:02.573
YOU KNOW, IT'S SENIOR YEAR.
YOU SHOULD BE
HAVING SOME FUN.

22:02.620 --> 22:04.838
LOOK AT HIM.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.688
THEY'RE HANGING ON
HIS EVERY WORD.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.826
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ON ONE,
BUT THERE'S THIS THING
CALLED A DOUBLE DATE.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.680
AND IT'S WHAT YOU DO
WITH YOUR FRIENDS

22:12.730 --> 22:14.357
WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY
BE SEEN IN PUBLIC

22:14.400 --> 22:15.890
WITH THE PERSON
YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.695
OH, MY GOD.
I AM SO BUSTED.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.605
HACKETT JUST SAW ME
STARING AT EZRA.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.505
NOW HE'S WALKING OVER HERE.

22:26.540 --> 22:29.634
I THINK THAT WHAT
MR. FITZ MEANT WAS
STEINBECK USED

22:29.680 --> 22:31.944
THE FARMER AS
A METAPHOR FOR
HIS FRUSTRATION.

22:33.010 --> 22:34.011
IS HE GONE?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.813
NO. AND HE'S
TOTALLY WATCHING YOU.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.619
Girl: LET'S JUST MEET AT YOUR
HOUSE AFTER SCHOOL.

22:52.900 --> 22:53.969
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.831
YEAH, SURE.

22:58.470 --> 22:59.869
YOU LOOK TIRED.
WELL, I ONLY

22:59.910 --> 23:02.128
SLEPT FOR LIKE
TWELVE MINUTES LAST NIGHT.

23:02.180 --> 23:05.707
EVERY TIME I CLOSED
MY EYES I SAW WILDEN.

23:05.750 --> 23:10.016
AND THEN I SAW A PIG,
AND THEN I SAW WILDEN
WITH A PIG FACE.

23:10.050 --> 23:12.712
LA BRIDE SURLECOU.

23:12.750 --> 23:15.981
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
WE'RE WAITING FOR THIS
"A'S" SHOE TO DROP.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.818
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE
WAITING FOR IT TO
STOMP ON US.

23:18.860 --> 23:20.521
CAREFUL, HAN NA.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.461
WHEN YOU USE WORDS
LIKE "US" AND "WE,"
MY MIND GOES TO

23:23.500 --> 23:24.592
THIS PLACE WHERE
I THINK WE COULD

23:24.630 --> 23:25.995
ACTUALLY
BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.667
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN MY DAD LEFT?

23:30.710 --> 23:32.632
I DID NOT WANT
TO GET OUT OF BED,

23:32.670 --> 23:36.731
BUT YOU FORCED ME
TO GO TO EVERY SALE
THAT SUMMER AT THE MALL.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.748
YEAH.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.146
I MISS MY
SHOPPORTUNIST FRIEND.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.782
LOOK, I HAVE A FRENCH
STUDY GROUP AFTER SCHOOL,

23:47.820 --> 23:51.859
BUT I CAN CANCEL,
IF YOU WANT TO HIT MACYS.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.029
I DON'T JUST WANT IT.
I NEED IT.

23:56.030 --> 23:58.897
C'EST UN RENDEZ-VOUS.
IT'S A DATE.

23:58.930 --> 24:01.194
COCO CHANEL.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.205
Man (over loudspeaker):
ARIA MONTGOMERY,

24:11.250 --> 24:13.844
REPORT TO THE VICE
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.213
ARIA MONTGOMERY, PLEASE REPORT
TO THE VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

25:00.930 --> 25:04.593
I GAVE YOU A CHANCE TO BE HONEST
WITH ME. AND YOU CHOSE TO LIE.

25:05.630 --> 25:06.824
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN.

25:06.870 --> 25:09.031
I KNOW YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH YOUR TEACHER.

25:10.670 --> 25:14.106
I WANTED TO BELIEVE YOU.
BUT AFTER RECEIVING
AN ANONYMOUS CORRESPONDENCE

25:14.140 --> 25:15.471
FROM A CONCERNED STUDENT--

25:15.510 --> 25:19.776
WELL, I TOLD YOU THAT
MR. FITZ AND I HAD SEEN
EACH OTHER AFTER

25:19.810 --> 25:20.674
HE LEFT ROSEWOOD HIGH--
ONLY OCCASIONALLY,

25:20.720 --> 25:23.780
BUT BROKE IT OFF
BEFORE IT BECAME SERIOUS.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.564
WE'VE CALLED YOUR PARENTS.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.919
( phone ringing )

25:41.300 --> 25:42.733
YES.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.337
I'M RELIEVED TO KNOW
HE'S IN CUSTODY.
THANK YOU.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.179
YOU'RE ARRESTING HIM?

25:48.210 --> 25:52.772
IN THIS STATE,
IT'S A FELONY FOR A TEACHER
TO HAVE SEX WITH A MINOR.

25:52.810 --> 25:54.209
EZRA FITZ IS GOING TO PRISON.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.717
MISS MONTGOMERY!

26:21.110 --> 26:23.101
SORRY TO KEEP
YOU WAITING.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.876
UH, YOUR MOM SUGGESTED
I HAVE YOU BRING THESE
HOME FOR HER TO SIGN.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.115
( sighs )

26:31.150 --> 26:33.015
SURE,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.610
AND TELL HER I HOPE
SHE'S FEELING BETTER.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.319
( sighs )

27:01.150 --> 27:03.710
IT LOOKS INCREDIBLE...

27:03.750 --> 27:07.288
BUT IT'S JUST SO FAR AWAY.

27:07.320 --> 27:10.289
THAT'S WHAT
I LOVE ABOUT IT.

27:10.320 --> 27:14.256
IT'S GOT ONE OF
THE BEST SWIM PROGRAMS
IN THE COUNTRY.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.858
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE EXCITED.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.994
OH, IT'S AN
AMAZING OPPORTUNITY.

27:19.030 --> 27:22.932
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT.
YOU HAVE TO SAY YES.

27:22.970 --> 27:25.768
IT'S AN AMAZING
OPPORTUNITY FOR US, EMILY.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.402
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.271
TO STAN FORD?

27:29.310 --> 27:31.175
THEY OFFERED ME
A FULL RIDE.

27:31.210 --> 27:34.145
AND YOU'RE AS GOOD AS I AM.
IF THEY WANT ME,
TH EY'LL WANT YOU, TOO.

27:34.180 --> 27:36.944
I JUST THOUGHT I WAS ALWAYS
GOING TO GO TO DANBY.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.813
DANBY'S GREAT.

27:39.850 --> 27:43.854
BUT YOU AND ME IN CALIFORNIA.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.357
THINK ABOUT IT.

27:45.390 --> 27:48.052
EXCEPT FOR HAWAII,
YOU CAN'T FIND A COLLEGE
THAT'S FURTHER AWAY

27:48.100 --> 27:50.762
FROM ROSEWOOD.
FURTHER AWAY FROM "A."

27:52.770 --> 27:54.032
WE'LL LIVE TOGETHER,

27:54.070 --> 27:56.334
AND YOU CAN DECORATE
THE PLACE HOWEVER YOU WANT.

27:56.370 --> 27:58.258
WE'LL STUDY ON THE BEACH.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.005
SPEND WEEKENDS
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.804
AND HOW MUCH FUN
WOULD IT BE TO DRIVE
ACROSS COUNTRY?

28:02.840 --> 28:05.047
YOU, ME, DONUTS
AND DINERS.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.914
WE CAN START OVER OUT THERE.

28:12.090 --> 28:15.810
DON'T YOU WANT TO LIVE
WHERE YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
OF THE DARK?

28:15.860 --> 28:18.749
IN A PLACE WHERE
I DON'T ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE AFRAID FOR YOU?

28:22.230 --> 28:23.299
YES.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.423
YES?

28:26.470 --> 28:28.791
I WANT TO GO.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.795
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.330
OH, YES!

28:31.370 --> 28:33.361
OH!

28:33.410 --> 28:35.799
I REALLY LOVE YOU.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.944
OH, COME HERE.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.013
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

28:47.090 --> 28:49.979
WANT ME TO HELP YOU TAKE
EVERYTHING UPSTAIRS?

28:50.020 --> 28:52.853
UM, NO. I'LL JUST PUT
IT AWAY LATER.

28:54.930 --> 28:57.899
YOU SURE? I DON'T MIND.

28:57.930 --> 28:59.466
HOW ABOUT A SODA?

28:59.500 --> 29:02.367
SURE.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.359
SO, WHEN CALEB COMES BACK
YOU SHOULD SURPRISE HIM
WITH THAT LACE CAMISOLE.

29:06.410 --> 29:09.504
MAYBE WITH THAT SHEER
DONNA KARAN BARELY BUTTONED.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.246
GOOD IDEA.

29:13.380 --> 29:15.746
HAS HE FOUND HIS DAD?

29:18.020 --> 29:22.514
UM, HE WAS HEADING
TO HIS AUNT'S CABIN.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.189
AND THEY REALLY DON'T
HAVE GOOD CELL SERVICE
THERE, SO...

29:26.230 --> 29:28.926
I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HIM.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.463
MAYBE HE GOT LUCKY.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.195
YEAH.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.992
SO, HOW 'BOUT YOU?

29:37.040 --> 29:39.338
WHO ARE YOU WEARING
THAT BLUE STRAPLESS FOR?

29:39.370 --> 29:41.873
WELL, SINCE NOEL THERE
HASN'T BEEN ANYBODY.

29:41.910 --> 29:45.004
SO, I BOUGHT IT FOR ME.

29:45.050 --> 29:48.042
THAT'S A HEALTHY ATTITUDE.
YEAH.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.888
THAN KS.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.899
I SHOULD ACTUALLY
PROBABLY GET GOING.

30:01.930 --> 30:02.954
I HAD FUN TODAY.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.298
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

30:05.330 --> 30:07.969
I KNOW YOU'RE JUST
PRETENDING TO BE
MY FRIEND AGAIN.

30:21.420 --> 30:26.949
IT'S THE ONLY COPY.
IF I WERE YOU, I'D BURN IT.

30:28.020 --> 30:30.614
YOU'RE GIVING IT TO ME?

30:30.660 --> 30:32.525
JUST LIKE THAT?

30:32.560 --> 30:35.120
YEAH.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.924
I REALLY LOVED YOU ONCE.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.222
AND I REALLY
WAS YOUR FRIEND.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.244
I HAD A REALLY
GREAT NIGHT.
ME, TOO.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.389
DRIVE SAFE.
THAN KS.

31:07.530 --> 31:09.953
Jenna:
YOU TWO MAKE A CUTE COUPLE.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.966
DID YOU SLITHER ON DOWN HERE
TO COMMENT ON MY LOVE LIFE?

31:14.000 --> 31:14.864
I NEED A FAVOR.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.436
YEAH, WRONG ADDRESS.
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T

31:16.470 --> 31:18.506
KNOW THAT DARREN
WAS A FRIEND OF MINE.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.406
WE MET RIGHT AFTER
I MOVED TO TOWN.

31:24.980 --> 31:27.005
CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S DEAD.

31:28.350 --> 31:30.671
SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

31:30.720 --> 31:35.259
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME,
CAN YOU GIVE TOBY A MESSAGE?

31:35.290 --> 31:36.655
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU?

31:36.690 --> 31:38.453
SEEMS TO ME LIKE
YOU'RE INDESTRUCTIBLE.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.128
WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT EVERYONE WHO SAW ALI

31:40.160 --> 31:42.958
THE NIGHT SHE WENT
MISSING IS WAKING UP DEAD.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.991
WILDEN SAW ALI THAT NIGHT?

31:45.030 --> 31:47.225
THAT'S WHAT GARRETT TOLD ME.

31:47.270 --> 31:49.158
DID YOU BURN YOURSELF?

31:51.310 --> 31:54.677
TOBY ISN'T ANSWERING
MY CALLS, AND I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE STILL FRIENDS.

31:54.710 --> 31:57.679
TELL HIM I NEVER
MEANT TO HURT HIM.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.344
( tablet beeps )

32:37.620 --> 32:38.609
( tablet beeps )

32:55.670 --> 32:57.763
Newscaster: IT FEELS LIKE
THE ENTIRE TOWN OF ROSEWOOD

32:57.800 --> 32:59.700
HAS COME TOGETHER
TO MOURN THE LOSS

32:59.740 --> 33:02.607
OF DETECTIVE DARREN WILDEN,
ONE OF ROSEWOOD'S

33:02.640 --> 33:05.200
MOST HIGH-PROFILE
POLICE OFFICERS.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.548
* DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THIS WOULD BE *

33:07.580 --> 33:10.242
* BU I KNEW
I DIDN'T SEE *

33:10.280 --> 33:14.683
* WHAT YOU THOUGHT
YOU SAW IN ME *

33:16.260 --> 33:21.129
* I JUMPED THE GUN
SO SURE YOU'D SPLIT AND RUN *

33:21.160 --> 33:25.995
* READY FOR THE WORST
BEFORE THE DAMAGE WAS DONE *

33:27.800 --> 33:30.530
DO YOU REALLY THINK
"A" PUT SOMETHING IN THERE?

33:30.570 --> 33:33.334
WITH HIS ROTTING,
STINKING CORPSE.

33:33.370 --> 33:36.373
SINCE THERE'S A VIEWING,
YOU CAN ASSUME THAT
HE'S BEEN EMBALMED.

33:36.410 --> 33:39.277
AND THAT WOULD SUSPEND
DECOMPOSITION AND PREVENT
THE MOURNERS FROM HAVING

33:39.310 --> 33:41.517
TO DEAL WITH THE ROTTING
AND EVENTUAL PUTRESCENCE
OF THE CORPSE.

33:41.550 --> 33:43.745
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL
DID SHE JUST SAY?

33:43.780 --> 33:45.782
WHO IS THAT?

33:54.160 --> 33:56.720
GUYS, "CLOSED CASKETS
KEEP SECRETS.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.194
HIS IS OPEN
AND EXPOSES YOURS."

33:59.230 --> 34:01.733
THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THAT COFFIN THAT'S
INCRIMINATING TO US.

34:01.770 --> 34:04.739
ARE YOU REALLY SO
SURE ABOUT EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SO SURE ABOUT?

34:04.770 --> 34:07.762
YES. AND IN ABOUT
THIRTY MINUTES
THEY'RE GOING TO OPEN

34:07.810 --> 34:10.131
THE CASKET FOR VIEWING,
PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO WALK PAST TO SAY

34:10.180 --> 34:12.444
GOODBYE TO WILDEN.
WHATEVER "A"
HAS ON US--

34:12.480 --> 34:14.471
OKAY, WE DIDN'T KILL WILDEN.
SO WHAT COULD IT BE?

34:14.520 --> 34:15.669
BESIDES ANOTHER SET-UP.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.449
YEAH, EM'S RIGHT.
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.539
IF WE GET BUSTED FOR
POKING AROUND THAT CASKET--

34:19.590 --> 34:21.455
I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE A CHOICE.
WE HAVE TO LOOK.

34:23.190 --> 34:25.385
I MEAN, AT MY
GRANDMA'S FUNERAL,
THEY KEPT THE CASKET

34:25.430 --> 34:27.819
IN A PRIVATE ROOM
UNTIL THE SERVICE STARTED.

34:27.860 --> 34:29.555
LET'S JUST GO FIND IT.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.737
ARIA WAS RIGHT.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.567
THE CASKET ISN'T HERE YET.

34:38.610 --> 34:42.569
OKAY, SO LET'S SPLIT UP.
AND IF YOU FIND IT,
SEND OUT AN S.O.S.

34:49.180 --> 34:52.115
( indistinct conversation )

35:44.670 --> 35:47.207
( phone ringing )

35:53.280 --> 35:55.419
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
THE SAME "A" MESSAGE.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.216
( phone ringing )

36:11.430 --> 36:13.569
( phone ringing louder)

36:18.240 --> 36:21.368
( phone continues ringing )

36:29.720 --> 36:32.439
( muttering under breath )
( sighs )

36:32.490 --> 36:33.889
Spencer:
BLOCKED.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.688
Mona:
KISSES?

36:37.720 --> 36:39.756
REDIAL?

36:39.790 --> 36:41.929
I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
UNTIL YOU DO.

36:42.930 --> 36:44.659
( phone redialing )

36:44.700 --> 36:47.999
( phone ringing )

36:48.030 --> 36:49.566
Woman ( over phone ):
HELLO?

36:49.600 --> 36:51.192
HAN NA?

36:52.440 --> 36:55.238
WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME
ON MY MOM'S PHONE?

37:02.320 --> 37:04.311
( church bells ringing )

37:08.320 --> 37:09.548
HOW DID "A" GET THIS?

37:09.590 --> 37:10.682
YOU'RE SURE IT'S HER'S?

37:10.720 --> 37:12.620
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO MY MOM...

37:12.660 --> 37:14.457
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO HER?

37:14.500 --> 37:15.728
THIS MORNING.
SHE CALLED ME FROM THE HOTEL.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.853
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT MEANS SHE'S OKAY.

37:17.900 --> 37:20.824
HANNA, THERE'S NO WAY
WE'RE LETTING "A"
BRING DOWN MRS. M.

37:20.870 --> 37:22.428
SO, IS THAT
WHAT THIS MEANS?

37:22.470 --> 37:23.835
MY MOM'S "A'S" TARGET?

37:27.040 --> 37:29.531
YOU GIRLS ALL LOOK SO PRETTY.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.741
HI, MRS. DILAURENTIS.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.475
ALI WOULD BE SO PROUD OF YOU,
HANNA.

37:33.510 --> 37:35.046
YOU'VE REALLY KEPT
THE WEIGHT OFF.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.810
THANK YOU.

37:37.850 --> 37:39.989
WHY DON'T YOU GIRLS COME
AND SIT NEXT TO ME?

38:19.860 --> 38:21.794
WHO IS THAT?

38:32.740 --> 38:33.968
All in prayer:
THE LORD IS MY SHEPARD,

38:34.010 --> 38:35.830
I SHALL NOT WANT.

38:57.860 --> 38:59.794
SO, THESE ARE YOUR TOYS?

39:01.100 --> 39:02.897
YOU DON'T PLAY WITH THEM.

39:06.940 --> 39:08.771
I KNOW YOU WANT TO KISS ME.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.772
YOU'RE HOME ALREADY?

39:16.820 --> 39:19.709
MOM.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.479
IT'S FOUR O'CLOCK.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.082
ARE YOU OKAY?

39:28.530 --> 39:30.998
I--I'M JUST A LITTLE TIRED.

39:31.030 --> 39:33.590
NO, YOU'RE NOT JUST
A LITTLE TIRED, MOM.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.461
I THINK SOMETHING'S
GOING ON WITH YOU.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.388
Marion:
OH...

39:39.140 --> 39:41.472
I'LL MAKE YOU A SNACK.

39:47.850 --> 39:49.715
DID SHE JUST WAKE UP?

39:53.650 --> 39:55.652
I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER.

39:55.690 --> 39:56.884
YEAH.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.388
IT'S CALLED "LAZY MUCH"?

40:01.760 --> 40:03.625
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.493
SERIOUSLY?
YES.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.962
LOSER.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.759
( door slamming )

40:17.810 --> 40:19.107
( sighs )

40:48.210 --> 40:49.837
WHO IS THAT?

40:49.880 --> 40:55.477
* I'LL KEEP QUIET
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW I'M HERE *

40:55.520 --> 40:58.580
EMILY, SPENCER, ARIA,
AND HANNA?

40:59.590 --> 41:01.478
YES?

41:01.520 --> 41:04.887
I'M OFFICER HOLBROOK.
PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.818
MY PARTNER AND I ARE
INVESTIGATING THE MURDERS

41:06.860 --> 41:09.226
OF OFFICER REYNOLDS
AND DETECTIVE WILDEN.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.694
WE ALREADY SPOKE TO THE POLICE
WHEN GARRETT WAS KILLED.

41:11.730 --> 41:13.960
I READ THAT IN THE REPORT.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.764
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN READING
A LOT ABOUT YOU FOUR.

41:18.140 --> 41:20.028
WILDEN HAD A THING FOR YOU.

41:22.910 --> 41:25.504
I'VE READ THROUGH
MOST OF HIS NOTES
AND I AGREE WITH YOU.

41:25.550 --> 41:28.576
HIS CONDUCT BORDERS
ON UNPROFESSIONAL AT BEST.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.042
THANK YOU.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.480
SO WHY DID YOU COME
TO HIS FUNERAL?

41:34.660 --> 41:37.254
WE'RE, UH, SUPPORTING OUR
LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT.

41:37.290 --> 41:39.554
I'M SURE IT'S APPRECIATED.

41:40.790 --> 41:43.156
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO BRING
YOU IN FOR QUESTIONING.

41:43.200 --> 41:46.260
BUT REMEMBER,
WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.666
JUST HERE TO FIND
OUT THE TRUTH.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.771
( phones beeping )

42:01.580 --> 42:02.979
"TRUTH WON'T SET YOU FREE,
BITCH ES."

42:04.320 --> 42:06.242
"I'M GOING TO BURY
YOU WITH IT."

42:06.290 --> 42:08.713
"KISSES, A."

42:08.760 --> 42:10.216
OH, MY GOD.

42:13.330 --> 42:15.150
Hanna:
"A" WAS THERE THAT NIGHT?

42:20.300 --> 42:22.734
Aria:
SHE RECORDED THE WHOLE THING.

42:24.140 --> 42:27.928
* YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT HIT YOU *

42:30.280 --> 42:34.205
* WON'T SEE ME
CLOSING IN *

42:36.720 --> 42:40.019
* I'M GOING TO MAKE
YOU SUFFER *

42:40.050 --> 42:42.951
* THAT'S HOW YOU
PUT ME IN *

42:42.990 --> 42:46.926
* I'M UNDERNEATH
YOUR SKIN *

42:46.960 --> 42:52.023
* THE DEVIL WITHIN

42:52.070 --> 42:55.335
* YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT HIT YOU *

42:56.700 --> 42:59.168
*LA,LA,LA

43:02.680 --> 43:07.674
* THE DEVIL WITHIN

43:07.710 --> 43:10.770
* YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT HIT YOU *
