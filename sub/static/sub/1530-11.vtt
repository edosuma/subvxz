00:01.400 --> 00:03.880
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.960 --> 00:06.361
I was killed. Well, almost.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.602
Afterwards, it's kind of a blank.

00:08.680 --> 00:09.806
Not everyone gets sent to Tahiti.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.848
It's a magical place.

00:11.920 --> 00:12.921
He really doesn't know, does he?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.206
He can never know.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.281
What is Centipede?

00:15.360 --> 00:17.203
It's an intravenous filter for his blood.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.886
Those soldiers at the warehouse
were forced to attack us?

00:19.960 --> 00:21.166
Through that eye thing?

00:21.240 --> 00:24.528
When the tide turned in our favor,
Centipede flipped Hayward's kill switch.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.567
Don't do...

00:25.640 --> 00:27.165
Po's the strategist,
Raina's their recruiter.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.571
Perhaps this Clairvoyant's the money.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.483
- Why do they want you?
- They took Coulson.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.561
Take care of my boy!

00:32.920 --> 00:34.331
Mike!

00:34.400 --> 00:37.847
We want you to tell us
about the day after you died.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.046
100% premium-grade Chitauri metal.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.645
As rare as it gets.

00:56.160 --> 00:59.050
How'd you get your hands
on this, Vanchat?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.571
It's what I do.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.449
Find alien scrap no one else can,

01:02.520 --> 01:05.126
then offer it to people
who fully appreciate my efforts.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.806
Hmm.

01:07.320 --> 01:09.527
I appreciate the hell out of them.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.284
- You can name your price.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.251
Is that a Roomba?

01:47.640 --> 01:49.290
Fitz-Simmons, he's heading your way.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.681
We've never done anything
like this before. Are you sure?

01:51.760 --> 01:54.809
It's time, Simmons.
Embrace the change.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.001
Skye. You're up.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.521
Here.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.080
- Let me get that for you.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.041
Mr. Vanchat.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.091
We were hoping you could
help us find a friend.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.682
Impressive. You actually managed
to reopen all your stitches.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.286
I just hope Vanchat
can lead us to Centipede.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.050
Well, the Chitauri metal he was selling

03:09.120 --> 03:12.283
is an exact match
to what Centipede used for their device.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.840
We find Centipede, we find Coulson.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.043
Don't ask questions, Agent Kob.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.805
Just get me the 5-millimeter injector.
That's an order.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.006
Yes, sir.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.528
Honestly, how many agents do
they think they can cram on this plane?

03:25.640 --> 03:27.324
It's only gonna get more crowded.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.521
We're set to pick up more men

03:28.600 --> 03:31.206
when Agent Hand
dumps Vanchat off at the Fridge.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.204
Honestly, I think it's good they're here.
We need fresh eyes.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.442
It's been 36 hours since
Agent Coulson was taken

03:36.520 --> 03:37.931
and none of us have gotten any rest.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.810
Oh, joy. Agent Hand
is giving another briefing.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.325
There was one fatality.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.050
The burned remains
recovered at the site

03:51.120 --> 03:53.771
are believed to be those of
Agent Trainee Michael Peterson.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.649
Other physical evidence
has proven scarce.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.200
Nothing relating to Mr. Po,
his Centipede associates,

03:58.280 --> 03:59.770
or their location has been found.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.650
- Any progress with Vanchat?
-Nothing actionable, Agent Ward.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.445
But I have my best interrogator
in there right now.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.046
Vanchat will talk,
and rest assured, when he does,

04:08.120 --> 04:11.727
not a single stone will be left unturned
until we take down Centipede.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.725
- And find Agent Coulson.
-And get Coulson back.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.605
We have a security breach.
Someone's hacking the system.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.281
Just in time.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.328
- Can you override this?
-What do you think you're doing?

04:25.400 --> 04:27.368
The money trail's our key
to finding Coulson.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.761
I just need to gain access
to Vanchat's financials,

04:30.120 --> 04:32.771
and from there, I should be able
to trace Centipede's payments

04:32.840 --> 04:34.080
and then hack into their account.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.527
You're the consultant,
the one who shot Agent Sitwell.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.806
Technically, that wasn't me.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.002
I want you off this plane immediately.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.041
What?

04:42.120 --> 04:45.442
Wait. I know I'm not some badass
field agent like May or Ward,

04:45.520 --> 04:46.806
but this is what I do.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.088
You can't just kick me off this mission.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.164
Listen, I'll do whatever you say.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.488
All this protocol crap
doesn't matter to me.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.642
All that matters to me is Coulson.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.643
Well, all this "protocol crap"
matters to me.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.689
You're a distraction. And you're gone.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.569
Agent Hand.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.725
I know Skye's methods are unorthodox.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.246
But she's a member of this team.
She can help.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.641
Agent May, your professional opinion.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.087
Will this girl be of any use to us
on this plane?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.001
No.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.165
Increase her restriction level,
confiscate her laptop and phone.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.641
- Then have her delivered to debrief.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.327
I'll do it. I'm her S.O.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.846
It's clear that May
has an ax to grind with me,

05:42.920 --> 05:44.763
but that was way out of line.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.201
No one knows what's in May's head
except May.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.408
Don't worry. Coulson will make
this right when he gets back.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.289
I can find him, Ward.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.605
I believe you.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.524
I've seen firsthand what you can do,

05:55.600 --> 05:57.967
even without S.H.I.E.L.D. resources.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.727
- Hang on. Hang on.
-We have something for you.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.601
You made me a sandwich?

06:03.680 --> 06:05.489
Yes, it is that.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.248
It's a satellite phone. Damper-resistant.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.209
You get one shot before
your bracelet shuts it down.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.970
So only call in case of emergency.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.571
What do I even need this for?

06:13.640 --> 06:14.971
I'm gonna be spending
the next three days

06:15.040 --> 06:16.849
in a S.H.I.E.L.D. broom closet
getting debriefed.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.524
That's right.
A few agents are coming here

06:18.600 --> 06:23.447
to pick you up for debriefing
 in exactly 12 minutes.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.326
Good luck.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.528
Don't touch Lola.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.161
Mmm.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.489
Can you feel that?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.325
Don't stop.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.651
Listen to him.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.366
Who ordered this?

06:58.200 --> 07:00.771
It seems you passed out.

07:03.120 --> 07:06.010
Now maybe you're ready to share
what memories you're seeing.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.727
I saw

07:13.520 --> 07:17.684
Jordan hitting that game-winner
over Russell in the '98 finals.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.762
- So clutch.
- Agent Coulson.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.287
We're gonna turn the machine
back on and open your mind.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.044
It's time to stop fighting it.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.527
If you don't,
you won't survive the process.

07:28.840 --> 07:31.207
I'll let you kill me
before I give you anything.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.527
It seems you have
a taste for that anyway.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.128
Murdered Mike Peterson
in front of his own son...

07:37.200 --> 07:40.409
Mr. Peterson chose that end.

07:40.520 --> 07:44.161
We gave him his life
and his child, unscathed.

07:44.240 --> 07:48.131
You're upset because
that man's death hits so close to home.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.721
Seeing a boy lose his father
at such a young age,

07:54.040 --> 07:55.724
as you did.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.564
A defining moment.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.367
The Clairvoyant saw that.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.206
I hate to break it to you,
but your telepathic friend is a fraud.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.643
Otherwise, he'd know all these answers,
and I wouldn't be here.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.769
It's true, this is strange.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.889
My friend can see that you died.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.966
You went cold.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.122
Your heart was torn to pieces.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.486
What The Clairvoyant can't see
is what happened after.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.081
How they brought you back
from the dead.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.490
For some reason, Agent Coulson,
you're different.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.441
Now, why is that?

08:38.919 --> 08:41.924
So, we have to do this the hard way.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.846
Just need an exploit.
Some way in.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.721
Come on!

09:06.480 --> 09:08.209
- What?
- What's going on?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.647
- Weird.
- I think it's the wireless.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.167
- Here's your change, sir.
- Uh, thank you.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.526
Hey, Lloyd. You might be my way in.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.481
- That's what I said. Yeah.
-One second.

09:37.600 --> 09:41.491
Of course, I love truffles.
But not on that. What an idiot.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.844
So fax me over that stuff.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.245
No, sweetie, listen to me.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.846
It was a private jet.
Of course there was Wi-Fi.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.491
He should have at least
texted you back.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.006
No! That's too much.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.091
I know the Night-Night rounds
no longer affect the Centipede Soldiers,

10:02.160 --> 10:05.084
but all we want to do is disable them,
not kill them.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.766
I'm good with either, frankly.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.607
Fitz, you don't mean that.
Those soldiers are just men...

10:10.680 --> 10:12.967
Who can smash your skull open
with a single punch.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.087
But they're being controlled.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.049
Centipede is making them fight
against their will.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.281
Well, they took Coulson.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.805
I don't care what we have to do
to get him back.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.961
We need to bring him home.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.362
What's this guy doing?
Lulling Vanchat to sleep?

10:25.640 --> 10:26.721
I'm going in.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.922
Damn it.

10:45.640 --> 10:49.042
Okay, Skye. You just need a Plan B.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.890
Roadside Assistance.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.450
We see you've had an accident.

11:12.560 --> 11:16.724
Yeah. Can you send somebody
to tow me back to my house?

11:16.800 --> 11:19.644
Of course,
I'll dispatch someone right away.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.563
Are you okay?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.768
Yeah. I'm good.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.762
Agent Hand needs you.
Says it's urgent.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.327
Time to talk.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.003
The names of all your buyers.
Alphabetically would help.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.690
I'm not telling you a bloody thing.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.370
That's how you wanna play it?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.490
Rochambeau you?

12:24.480 --> 12:25.686
Rochambeau.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.802
Scissors? Oh, Fitz!

12:35.840 --> 12:37.365
I've got all day.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.481
Whoa!

12:41.880 --> 12:45.487
All right! All right, I'll talk! I'll talk!

13:15.720 --> 13:17.722
The town that the bomb forgot.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.966
It was built in the '40s
for nuclear testing.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.123
But when the Cold War ended,
the town was spared.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.844
Not exactly prime real estate.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.001
Hmm.

13:28.080 --> 13:32.244
True. There's nothing but desert
for hundreds of miles.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.404
But I really like it. It's nice here.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.444
The children are always playing,

13:44.360 --> 13:45.885
yet never make a sound.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.367
Shall we get back to it, then?

13:54.240 --> 13:56.811
So you sure you don't want me
to take it to the dealer?

13:56.880 --> 13:58.609
No, thanks. I got a guy.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.450
All right. Thank you.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.930
Dollar bills, y'all.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.001
Lloyd Rathman's office.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.805
This is the LAPD.
I need to speak with Mr. Rathman.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.770
We recovered a stolen vehicle
registered in his name.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.763
- Oh! Was it damaged?
-Yes, ma'am.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.481
We have two officers waiting at
his home ready to take a statement.

14:50.560 --> 14:55.009
How long do you think it'll take
Mr. Rathman to get there?

15:04.840 --> 15:07.320
You're in a lot of trouble, Mr. Rathman.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.446
Who the hell are you?

15:10.760 --> 15:13.604
Agent Melinda May, with S.H.I.E.L.D.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.047
Look, clearly there's been
a misunderstanding.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.844
I'm a legitimate businessman.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.969
S.H.I.E.L.D. has evidence your
company has been siphoning funds

15:25.040 --> 15:27.930
into an offshore account
for some very bad people.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.684
My client's business is their business.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.922
Well, my business
is catching those guys.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.480
If it turns out you've made profit
from just one of them,

15:34.560 --> 15:37.211
S.H.I.E.L.D. is prepared to
freeze all of your assets.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.486
I'm calling my lawyer.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.527
Do that, and my offer's off the table.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.727
- What offer's that?
-Immunity.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.850
You walk. Free and clear.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.082
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't touch
a single asset.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.241
Not even your party boat in Key Largo.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.721
And if I say no?

15:55.800 --> 15:57.484
You spend five years in the Fridge.

15:58.360 --> 16:01.011
- The "Fridge"?
-it's worse than it sounds.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.006
All right. What do you want?

16:04.080 --> 16:05.570
Follow me to your office.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.130
We've got some work to do.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.769
Vanchat's intel is paying off.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.531
We're pursuing every known buyer
of Chitauri metals around the globe.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.444
The largest is a warehouse in Sydney.
We're heading there now.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.287
This is our chance
to take down Centipede.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.129
I want everyone in full tactical.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.287
And what about Agent Coulson?

16:27.400 --> 16:30.609
If we're lucky, Centipede's
holding him in Sydney. Dismissed.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.208
Agent Ward, a moment.

16:36.280 --> 16:40.330
First your friend Skye left the plane
and never arrived for her debrief,

16:40.400 --> 16:43.688
then Vanchat almost flies out
of the interrogation room.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.841
Do we have a problem?

16:45.440 --> 16:46.885
No, Agent Hand.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.611
Your man wasn't getting answers,
so I stepped in.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.920
Without my permission.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.241
Well, congratulations.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.085
Thanks to you
and your unique interrogation skills,

16:56.200 --> 16:59.602
we now have active strike teams
running raids all over the world.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.246
The question is, why?

17:02.800 --> 17:05.280
- Excuse me?
-it's unprecedented,

17:05.359 --> 17:08.489
this kind of response for
a Level 8 operative.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.046
The sheer manpower involved.

17:11.119 --> 17:12.848
I've been on the phone all day.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.964
Director Fury. Commander Hill.
Everyone wants an update.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.847
Frankly, I don't understand it.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.131
No single agent is that important.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.527
Coulson is.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.568
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s gonna find me
before you break me.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.130
S.H.I.E.L.D.?

17:39.560 --> 17:41.961
The Clairvoyant sees an end to all that.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.325
He doesn't look so good.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.368
Raina. What took you so long?

17:51.480 --> 17:53.403
I was tending to our other subject.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.450
The persuasion skills I've spoken to
The Clairvoyant so much about

17:56.520 --> 17:59.763
would be better sewed here,
with me, breaking this man.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.763
I would never use force
to bend a man to my wishes.

18:01.840 --> 18:02.921
He's being difficult.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.401
- He's being beaten.
-Into submission.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.769
The Clairvoyant requested it
and will tell me to...

18:10.680 --> 18:11.681
See?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.407
Yes.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.521
No.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.726
Well, I've only just begun.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.247
My methods are sound, I assure you.

18:24.840 --> 18:25.841
Right here?

18:29.040 --> 18:30.201
Yes.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.880
The Clairvoyant
would like to speak to you.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.040
This is Raina.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.407
Yes.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.166
I agree.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.127
Thank you.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.846
I'll put him back on.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.404
- Yes, I'm here.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.650
There a problem?

19:24.760 --> 19:28.082
Victoria Hand.
We don't exactly see eye to eye.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.605
I'm sure she's utilizing

19:29.680 --> 19:32.411
all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s resources
to find Coulson.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.081
Not all of them.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.125
You know, it wouldn't hurt
to have Skye working an exploit.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.089
Why didn't you stick up for her?

19:41.640 --> 19:42.721
Excuse me?

19:42.800 --> 19:44.564
She's proven herself
on multiple missions.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.087
She's a part of this team.
You let her get tossed.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.441
All I did was tell Hand the truth.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.288
Skye's no use to us on this plane.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.522
- How can you say that?
-She's not.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.288
Not with all these agents here.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.729
Over her shoulder,
monitoring her every move.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.770
- You wanted her off the plane.
-Outside the system.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.968
That's how Skye works best.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.407
You don't have to assume
the worst of me.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.927
Agent May, change of plans.
Sending new coordinates now.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.411
We found their helicopter

20:20.480 --> 20:22.801
at a laboratory
outside the Mojave Desert.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.803
- Copy that. Coordinates received.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.889
Hang on to something.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.962
You want me to hack into
a Swiss bank account?

20:48.040 --> 20:50.088
Just need you to type in
your private corporate ID

20:50.160 --> 20:51.400
to get me in the door.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.488
Yeah, well,
letting you in that door is a crime.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.961
Come to think of it, how do I know
you're not just some criminal?

20:56.040 --> 20:58.771
In my experience,
a Federal agent shows a badge.

20:58.840 --> 20:59.921
You want to see my badge?

21:05.280 --> 21:07.851
S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol Six Alpha Victor.

21:10.760 --> 21:14.242
There. That's my badge.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.045
Great. I just got
my high score in Tiny Wings.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.363
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been watching you
for quite some time, Mr. Rathman.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.646
You're a prime exploit.

21:22.200 --> 21:26.000
The gambling, the divorces,
that money pit in the Caymans.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.128
You're even behind
on your child support payments.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.806
Ugh, that's a clerical thing.
My ex knows that.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.962
But did David know that?

21:33.040 --> 21:34.565
David thinks I'm a cool dad.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.849
David thinks you're a jackass.
You gotta fix that, Lloyd.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.400
Kids need someone they can look up to.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.162
Now start typing.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.249
P.D. Security! Don't move!

21:45.400 --> 21:46.925
That's it. Nice and easy.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.047
- Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.566
- On the ground!

21:53.760 --> 21:54.886
- Okay, I'm typing. I'm typing.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.929
You S.H.I.E.L.D. guys
don't mess around.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.247
This is turning into
an interesting day, isn't it?

22:04.320 --> 22:05.401
So you're my friend now?

22:05.800 --> 22:08.246
'Cause I've seen what you do
to your friends.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.207
- Mr. Po?
-Yeah.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.363
He was a murderer.
incapable of remorse.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.369
I was thinking of Mike Peterson,
Chan Ho Yin.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.806
I gave them what they asked for.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.851
Mike wanted to be a hero
to his son. Now he is.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.127
Did Akela Amador
want a bomb in her head?

22:28.240 --> 22:29.810
The people you work for
are just as capable

22:29.880 --> 22:32.451
of using cruel means
to reach a justified end.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.209
And who do you work for, Raina?
The Clairvoyant?

22:40.520 --> 22:41.601
Yes.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.250
- Who is he?
-I don't know.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.842
Today was the first time
I personally made contact.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.289
My heart's still racing.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.089
He has you building super-soldiers.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.881
The Clairvoyant
gives us guidance. Formulas.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.200
For what?

22:57.960 --> 22:59.610
The changing world.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.290
The world your organization
brought upon us.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.849
We're new to the business of what
you've been doing for decades.

23:06.920 --> 23:10.367
So, now what? You have soldiers.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.284
You can make them strong.
You can control them.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.169
In an instant, you can kill them.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.925
Yes, but we can't
bring them back to life.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.804
You were killed.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.442
Now you're here.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.171
We want to know how.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.521
Don't you?

23:34.080 --> 23:36.321
I'd like to turn the machine on again.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.731
It induces theta brain wave frequencies

23:41.800 --> 23:46.328
to help uncover the secrets
buried in the subconscious.

23:47.240 --> 23:51.086
If you cooperate,
you can surf those waves.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.690
I've gone surfing.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.568
That is definitely not like surfing.

23:55.640 --> 23:56.766
You've been resisting.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.683
Fight the waves, and you'll drown.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.569
Your brain will cook.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.370
You'll stop breathing, again.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.328
Then that's What it'll be.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.085
Or I hold out until
my team comes to find me.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.528
Either way, you will not get
classified intel from me.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.046
I'm not interested in those secrets.

24:16.960 --> 24:20.203
The Clairvoyant can see within
any agency, any government.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.284
He knows what the President
dreams about at night.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.727
I want what you want,

24:26.560 --> 24:28.562
to uncover a different secret.

24:31.120 --> 24:34.249
The secret S.H.I.E.L.D.
is keeping from you.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.201
All right, we're logged in.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.329
But you do realize you can't transfer
these kinds of funds online?

24:44.800 --> 24:48.407
I'm not looking to transfer funds,
I'm looking for transaction records.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.530
Go to your account history.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.807
We need to open up
a terminal emulator,

24:52.880 --> 24:54.484
see what kind of encryption they've got.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.689
If it's an SSL 256, or an
AES twofish-serpent, we're in business.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.848
- Yeah.
-Quantum key, that's another story.

24:59.920 --> 25:00.921
Right.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.649
Lloyd. What is happening here?

25:07.240 --> 25:09.447
Yeah, account history, where is that?

25:14.880 --> 25:16.609
Delete that second line.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.287
Press "return."

25:19.360 --> 25:23.126
See, the thing is, I have an assistant
that does all this for me.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.326
--That's it.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.641
So, this Vanchat,
is this the guy you're trying to bust?

25:26.720 --> 25:29.087
No, we already have him in custody.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.369
What I wanna know is who's
recently paid Vanchat a lot of money.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.886
I backtrack those payments
to the buyer's account

25:34.960 --> 25:36.962
and get a record of
all the purchases she's made.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.646
Maybe use it to track her down.
Click there.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.883
Hello, Raina.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.964
Let's see what you've been up to.
Print that.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.488
Great. So are we done here?

25:50.080 --> 25:51.491
One last thing.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.444
And you're clinging
to the one thing you have,

26:00.520 --> 26:02.568
fond memories of your recovery.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.689
So this person you work for
told you I died

26:05.760 --> 26:08.081
and have gaps in my memory?

26:08.520 --> 26:10.090
Ever think your mind reader

26:10.160 --> 26:12.447
might just be looking up
symptoms online?

26:12.520 --> 26:16.127
I was also told it keeps you up at night,
that you crave answers,

26:16.200 --> 26:17.361
that you're troubled by the fact

26:17.440 --> 26:20.250
that when you asked for answers,
you were denied.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.890
Isn't that true?

26:22.400 --> 26:23.731
I trust the system.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.848
They keep secrets for a reason.

26:27.920 --> 26:32.164
But why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep
details of your death from you?

26:32.240 --> 26:34.083
They're your family.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.721
Your only family,
since you've lost your mother, too.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.922
Now, after all you've sacrificed...

26:42.000 --> 26:45.129
Sacrifice is part of the job.
I would give my life...

26:45.200 --> 26:47.123
You didn't just give your life.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.646
You gave up your chance
at a normal one.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.047
At love.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.888
And she did love you, Agent Coulson.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.564
- How could you know that?
-Do you miss her?

27:06.400 --> 27:08.164
Dinners at The Richmond?

27:09.240 --> 27:10.924
Do you miss hearing her play?

27:13.560 --> 27:16.040
You didn't even have a chance
to say goodbye.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.044
I couldn't. I can't.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.408
She cried for days after
S.H.I.E.L.D. told her you died.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.084
They shattered her heart

27:27.760 --> 27:29.000
with a lie.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.887
- And now they're lying to you.
-No.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.606
No, they're not.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.569
I know you don't wanna believe it.

27:37.640 --> 27:38.766
But you can't tell me

27:38.840 --> 27:42.561
nothing makes you doubt,
makes you wonder,

27:43.920 --> 27:45.763
what happened in Tahiti.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.285
It's a magical...

27:51.840 --> 27:52.966
I keep saying that.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.608
Don't you wanna know why?

28:08.920 --> 28:10.160
Turn it on.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.369
The Centipede soldiers each have
a port on their delivery device

28:15.440 --> 28:17.124
to inject refills of serum.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.044
With this injector cuff,
we can use the port to our advantage.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.407
By injecting a refined dose
of dendrotoxin

28:22.480 --> 28:24.164
to incapacitate the soldier.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.844
- How's it work?
-Oh.

28:26.320 --> 28:30.644
Just simply lock it around
the Centipede soldier's forearm.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.764
And night-night super powers.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.286
Sounds like riding a bull
for eight seconds.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.971
- Yeah, exactly. It's that simple.
-Yeah.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.882
- Hello?
-Simmons. It's me.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.641
Why, hello, Dr. Nugent.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.526
Is someone there?
Oh, God. Don't try to lie.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.807
You are the worst at this.
Remember our safe word.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.362
Manscaping?
Oh, I shouldn't have said that. Um...

28:56.440 --> 28:59.569
I am right as rain.
Couldn't be better, old chap.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.165
--You three, out.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.287
Listen up.

29:02.360 --> 29:05.443
I may have a lead on where
Centipede's holding Coulson.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.567
Skye?

29:09.280 --> 29:11.169
What have you found?

29:13.320 --> 29:15.448
We're about to launch
a major assault on a Centipede lab,

29:15.520 --> 29:18.251
and you wanna take your team to the
desert based on a hunch from Skye?

29:18.600 --> 29:20.409
It's not a hunch.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.962
Skye followed the money
from Vanchat back to Centipede.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.042
Turns out, they recently
purchased a small development

29:25.120 --> 29:26.770
less than 100 miles from here.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.683
Well, that's great news
for their real estate portfolio.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.081
But we have confirmed activity
at the lab.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.686
I'm taking a strike team to investigate.
End of story.

29:33.760 --> 29:34.886
So we split up.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.241
You take the strike team
and go after Centipede.

29:37.320 --> 29:40.085
We'll investigate Skye's lead,
see if Coulson's there.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.367
You backed my decision
to kick Skye off the plane.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.568
- Seems like it worked out.
-Seems like you played me.

29:44.640 --> 29:45.846
Look, this isn't personal.

29:45.920 --> 29:48.844
But I am taking my team
and we're gonna find Coulson.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.888
Send back-up if you want.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.768
What makes you so sure
this machine will even work?

30:03.840 --> 30:05.080
It worked on me.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.848
One thing before we start.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.410
What is it with the flowers?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.964
Who doesn't like flowers?

30:18.640 --> 30:19.880
I'm glad you noticed.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.930
Close your eyes and relax.

30:27.840 --> 30:32.528
I want you to think back to
your first memory after you died.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.049
What do you see?

30:39.840 --> 30:44.562
Sandy beach, blue waves.
Just as I remember it.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.451
Focus on the details.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.646
Can you feel that?

30:49.720 --> 30:51.802
Don't stop.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.844
Listen to him!

30:56.920 --> 30:58.649
Who ordered this?

30:59.720 --> 31:02.405
- What?
-Director Fury himself.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.125
Got creepy?

31:52.760 --> 31:53.886
- You shouldn't be here.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.006
There's nowhere to run!

32:09.280 --> 32:10.406
- Agent Coulson.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.649
Something's happening, isn't it?

32:18.080 --> 32:19.570
Listen to him!

32:20.320 --> 32:23.085
I need you to look at
your surroundings.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.722
Try and describe what you see.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.242
Are you still in Tahiti? Tell me.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.683
It's dark. There's nothing.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.524
Everything is dark.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.603
Coulson's gotta be here somewhere.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.125
We need to split up.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.565
Or run.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.565
- I'll take care of him.
-Are you sure?

32:53.680 --> 32:55.603
I got this.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.603
Come on, let's move!

33:02.920 --> 33:04.410
Coulson!

33:47.840 --> 33:50.764
Now, Coulson. Where the hell are you?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.367
He's drifting. He's drifting.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.449
He's drifting.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.800
- This is wrong.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.120
Can you feel that?

34:23.679 --> 34:25.170
- Don't!
-Listen to him!

34:25.239 --> 34:26.571
- Stop!
-Who ordered this?

34:26.639 --> 34:28.960
- Director Fury himself.
-This is wrong!

34:33.639 --> 34:35.051
- Listen to him!

34:35.120 --> 34:37.851
Let me die, please. Please.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.487
Please, I'm begging you, let me die.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.170
Please. Please let me die.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.524
Let me die, please!

34:47.120 --> 34:48.167
Please!

34:48.639 --> 34:51.085
Let me die! Please!

34:51.679 --> 34:53.045
Let me die!

34:57.280 --> 35:00.090
Stop fighting it, Agent Coulson.
Stop fighting it.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.929
- Please let me die.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.845
It's for his own good.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.441
Please let me die! Please let me die!

35:09.520 --> 35:13.286
Please let me die.
Let me die. Let me die, please.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.887
Coulson. Coulson.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.883
Come back. Come back.
Come back. Come back.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.283
Skye?

35:28.360 --> 35:29.566
Skye...

35:32.400 --> 35:33.731
Skye.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.725
Nice jacket.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.286
Bet there aren't any flower dresses
where she's going.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.521
Amen to that, sister.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.491
Dismissed.

36:04.560 --> 36:05.891
Let's go, ma'am.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.087
Just got off the phone
with headquarters.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.764
Director Fury was very relieved.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.605
I understand you've been busy.
Heard you put some miles on my plane.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.682
The manhunt has yielded
some impressive results.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.604
Centipede operations have been
taken down around the globe.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.444
- Any word on The Clairvoyant?
-Nothing yet.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.528
But it's going to be awfully hard
to stay hidden

36:27.600 --> 36:29.602
now that The Clairvoyant's
on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar.

36:29.680 --> 36:30.727
Good.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.683
Because Raina knew things about me.
Personal things.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.761
I want to know how.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.201
My men and I are taking her straight
to headquarters for questioning.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.327
We'll be in touch.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.126
Agent Hand?

36:42.040 --> 36:44.281
Thank you, for everything.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.203
Good to have you back.

36:47.280 --> 36:51.808
Honestly, this bus isn't really my style.

37:07.880 --> 37:11.521
I just want to say thank you.

37:18.440 --> 37:19.646
Now get back to work.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.529
I heard what you did for me.

37:35.960 --> 37:39.851
I think it's time that we remove this.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.843
Disengage bracelet.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.405
--Are you kidding me?

37:45.480 --> 37:47.323
Thought you'd like that.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.201
Back in that room.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.050
Did they learn anything?

37:58.000 --> 37:59.161
No.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.727
Did you?

38:04.520 --> 38:06.522
I heard what you were saying.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.326
It wasn't real.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.691
They were just messing with my head.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.608
But I appreciate your concern.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.406
Evening, Doctor.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.285
Agent Coulson.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.285
You weren't operating on my heart.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.210
- I know about Tahiti.
-I was afraid this day would come.

38:48.280 --> 38:51.807
- Because of what I'd do?
-Because of what I've done.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.930
After New York,

38:57.040 --> 38:59.646
you weren't dead for eight seconds,
or 40 seconds,

38:59.720 --> 39:01.722
or whatever they put in your file.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.962
You were dead for

39:04.960 --> 39:06.086
days.

39:06.920 --> 39:09.491
- That's impossible.
-It should be.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.570
But Director Fury
moved heaven and earth.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.484
He had a team of scientists
working around the clock,

39:15.600 --> 39:20.208
using procedures that
no good doctor would ever allow.

39:20.280 --> 39:21.327
You were there.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.609
Fury brought me in
during the seventh operation.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.249
We kept you conscious
to monitor brain activity,

39:29.320 --> 39:31.482
but you were in extreme pain.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.286
The neurological damage,
it was catastrophic.

39:37.440 --> 39:40.250
- I wanted to die.
-And we should have let you.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.969
The trauma you'd endured

39:45.320 --> 39:46.401
was ungodly.

39:46.480 --> 39:49.484
Why was that machine
messing with my brain?

39:49.600 --> 39:51.648
After what you'd been through,

39:55.160 --> 39:58.323
we wanted to restore
the man you'd once been.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.810
So we gave you a pleasant memory.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.484
Of a beautiful island.

40:05.440 --> 40:10.480
We didn't want you to be that thing.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.969
What had I become, Doctor?

40:17.560 --> 40:18.686
Tell me.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.524
You'd lost your will to live.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.169
We tried to give it back.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.927
I'm sorry, Agent Coulson.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.450
Truly I am.

40:40.360 --> 40:42.806
If you only knew...

41:33.760 --> 41:34.807
Hello?

41:37.440 --> 41:38.680
Anybody there?

41:40.080 --> 41:41.161
Hello?

41:54.680 --> 41:55.806
No!
