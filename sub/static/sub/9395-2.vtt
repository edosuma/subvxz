00:56.257 --> 00:57.629
Luke, Luke, what up dawg?

00:58.013 --> 01:00.691
Check this out. You shoot this one. See what you got.

01:03.711 --> 01:05.606
- Come on, lets move!
- Time to go, baby.

01:05.745 --> 01:06.815
Six-thirty, Luke!

01:07.132 --> 01:09.820
Oh, come on guys, you don’t gotta come. It’s just a game.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.733
Right. Whitey asked you to play on the team.

01:12.810 --> 01:13.859
And Nathan threatens you.

01:13.927 --> 01:16.390
You beat him right here one on one, you join the team.

01:16.486 --> 01:18.442
And now it’s the first game and we aint gotta come?

01:18.525 --> 01:22.190
We goin’. This game is for all of us.

01:24.812 --> 01:25.748
Go Luke!

01:32.227 --> 01:33.521
Karen! You ready to go?

01:34.038 --> 01:38.461
Oh. I’m not going. I decided to stay open. I could use the business.

01:39.128 --> 01:42.143
- You talk to Luke about this?
- No. But he’ll understand.

01:42.675 --> 01:44.304
- Karen...
- She doesn’t want to go.

01:44.375 --> 01:47.222
She doesn’t want to see her high school sweetheart slash your brother Dan slash the jerk

01:47.304 --> 01:50.480
who abandoned Lucas slash the father of Nathan, the team's star player slash my wrists

01:50.616 --> 01:52.466
if I hear this story again. Lets go.

01:53.218 --> 01:54.410
I think you’re making a mistake.

02:00.298 --> 02:04.036
Whitey can put this kid on the team, he can put him in the game, but he can’t put him in your game.

02:04.246 --> 02:06.360
So shut him out. And shut down the opposition.

02:06.602 --> 02:08.336
You’ve got Broner tonight. They’re good so be ready.

02:08.732 --> 02:09.370
Alright.

02:29.344 --> 02:30.114
Scott!

02:42.447 --> 02:44.531
I can’t believe the bastard spawn’s on our team.

02:46.149 --> 02:47.051
For now…

02:49.978 --> 02:50.716
You nervous?

02:51.402 --> 02:54.347
- A little bit.
- Good. You ought to be.

02:56.716 --> 02:59.666
Just do what you’ve been doing all week in practice. You’ll be fine.

03:05.318 --> 03:07.965
Luke! You mind if we get a few words before your first game?

03:08.031 --> 03:11.636
Yeah. We’re going to put it on the internet. Ravenshoops.com.

03:11.702 --> 03:13.598
Yeah. We’re going to have a web cast and everything.

03:13.909 --> 03:15.000
What the hell is this?

03:16.060 --> 03:19.009
- Well, we have this website.
- Yeah, we’re sports announcers.

03:19.075 --> 03:23.498
Not in here, you’re not. The locker room’s closed. No… media.

03:24.344 --> 03:26.643
Dude, did you hear that? We’re media.

03:26.967 --> 03:29.599
Not just media. Banned media.

03:33.244 --> 03:35.275
They don’t wanna what! Or we’re gonna what!

03:35.388 --> 03:37.790
- Or what! Or what!
- Alright. Lets take the court.

03:37.928 --> 03:43.565
Ravens! Ravens! Ravens!

03:43.708 --> 03:46.294
Want my world? You’ve got it.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.638
Keith! Hey. Finally came to see your nephew play, huh, big brother?

03:56.237 --> 03:57.968
Yeah. I guess you can say that.

04:05.099 --> 04:07.768
Tonight, Lucas Scott plays his first game for the Tree Hill Ravens.

04:07.844 --> 04:10.127
That’s right, Mouth. Now, the Ravens are 5 and O.

04:10.228 --> 04:13.542
But this is their first game following the suspension of six varsity players.

04:15.934 --> 04:16.644
Son!

04:26.856 --> 04:27.536
Wake up.

04:29.917 --> 04:31.247
All right, come on in.

04:31.868 --> 04:32.953
Hustle, hustle!

04:33.706 --> 04:35.242
So that’s the boy that beat Nathan?

04:36.962 --> 04:38.323
Well, he’s good from behind.

04:38.589 --> 04:40.417
Ravens on three. One! Two! Three!

04:42.421 --> 04:47.365
Luke, relax. Destiny has a way of finding you.

05:00.292 --> 05:01.363
Come on, Nathan.

05:01.815 --> 05:03.115
- Lets go.
- Come on.

05:08.010 --> 05:08.758
Nice hands.

05:09.326 --> 05:10.114
Nice legs.

05:17.554 --> 05:18.568
Lets see some game!

05:28.117 --> 05:29.352
Hey, which side you on?

05:31.373 --> 05:32.434
Go Ravens!

05:50.363 --> 05:51.198
Go Nathan.

05:52.647 --> 05:53.400
Out!

05:54.818 --> 05:55.670
Good.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.704
It’s not your night, son.

06:03.481 --> 06:05.642
Start taking notes, punk.

07:15.038 --> 07:17.118
What? I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

07:17.559 --> 07:18.903
Hey, I’m sorry.

07:27.516 --> 07:28.992
- Unbelievable.
- What?

07:29.272 --> 07:31.750
- Peyton, did you see how bad he sucked?
- So?

07:31.801 --> 07:34.531
He was horrible. I’ve never seen a guy play so bad.

07:34.593 --> 07:35.479
And you enjoyed that?

07:36.276 --> 07:37.976
Well, hell yeah. Didn’t you?

07:40.936 --> 07:42.860
What is this, Peyton? Do you like this guy or something?

07:43.332 --> 07:46.209
You mean more than my boyfriend who I’m trying to make out with right now?

07:46.302 --> 07:47.402
Well go put some ice on it.

07:47.848 --> 07:49.215
You ever think I might want to talk?

07:50.261 --> 07:53.214
No, you don’t. You want to celebrate a public humiliation

07:53.285 --> 07:54.919
and I’m sorry, that’s a little played out.

07:55.251 --> 07:57.435
Oh and being with you isn’t?

08:01.513 --> 08:04.027
Oh, Peyton, come on, I was joking.

08:10.232 --> 08:11.287
Are you getting in the car?

08:12.506 --> 08:13.469
Please?

08:16.689 --> 08:17.334
Fine.

08:20.022 --> 08:22.561
Take your lame music too. And have a nice walk home.

08:26.535 --> 08:29.945
Damnit, Nathan! That CD was hard to find.

08:30.616 --> 08:31.813
It’s an import.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.457
It’s open.

08:39.998 --> 08:42.008
- Hey.
- Is he okay?

08:43.162 --> 08:44.866
I don’t know. I didn’t see him afterward.

08:47.550 --> 08:49.100
You should’ve been there.

08:50.431 --> 08:52.060
Well, you shouldn’t have gone to Whitey.

08:53.068 --> 08:55.736
- I thought you supported this.
- I support Lucas.

08:56.225 --> 08:59.206
I didn’t have much of a choice after you went and got him on the team, did I?

09:00.472 --> 09:01.634
What’s going on?

09:04.418 --> 09:05.566
I should’ve been there.

09:08.516 --> 09:10.522
I thought I was over it, Keith, I really did.

09:10.963 --> 09:12.519
Maybe I’ve just been hiding.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.364
Just, I can’t go back there.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.930
The place knows too much.

09:35.606 --> 09:37.454
I guess misery really does love company.

09:39.892 --> 09:41.037
What are you doing here?

09:41.380 --> 09:42.559
Actually, I’m not here.

09:43.326 --> 09:44.760
I was never here.

09:46.623 --> 09:49.480
You know, I shoot the ball and it goes in.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.996
I don’t ask questions, I don’t think about it.

09:54.524 --> 09:55.829
It’s just the way it is.

09:56.848 --> 09:58.041
Or the way it was.

09:59.802 --> 10:00.514
Yeah.

10:01.216 --> 10:02.470
Lucas, it’s just a game.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.726
Who cares if the entire school, most of your friends

10:05.803 --> 10:08.419
and half the town saw you suck.

10:09.572 --> 10:11.533
So… you’ve clearly come to cheer me up.

10:14.800 --> 10:15.679
Want a ride?

10:40.644 --> 10:41.489
Nathan!

10:44.194 --> 10:45.023
Look at this.

10:46.292 --> 10:47.343
What did you do there?

10:50.352 --> 10:52.257
I was double teamed, so I found the open man.

10:52.446 --> 10:54.796
Wrong. You gave up a scoring opportunity in the post.

10:54.894 --> 10:57.638
What? Dad, I was double teamed. I scored 28 points.

10:57.715 --> 10:59.723
30 points would’ve looked better to the scouts, don’t you think?

11:01.351 --> 11:04.848
Go to sleep. You look winded in the fourth quarter. We’ll go for a run together in the morning.

11:07.285 --> 11:09.533
You wonder why Mom extends those business trips.

11:16.122 --> 11:17.781
Look, you mind if I ask you a question?

11:18.261 --> 11:18.917
Shoot.

11:19.353 --> 11:21.745
Why’d you decide to do it? Join the team?

11:22.517 --> 11:24.339
‘Cause you don’t exactly fit in here, do you?

11:25.447 --> 11:28.118
The game, I guess. I love the game.

11:28.266 --> 11:31.364
Right. The same reason I cheer. It’s all a big game.

11:32.295 --> 11:35.814
Why not just stay on the playground? Why join the varsity?

11:36.632 --> 11:38.687
Because I want to know if I’m good.

11:41.856 --> 11:44.753
Well, if you ask my opinion, we all just wasted a perfectly good evening.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.548
You, me, and everybody else in there.

11:50.436 --> 11:51.670
Then why do you do it?

11:53.898 --> 11:55.798
I mean, do you really like it or not?

11:56.545 --> 11:59.411
If I say that I liked it, then I’m just another cheerleader.

11:59.688 --> 12:04.921
But if I say that I hate it, then I’m either a liar or a fraud.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.113
Either way I lose.

12:12.903 --> 12:14.035
Do you want to come in?

12:15.550 --> 12:16.579
What about Nathan?

12:17.440 --> 12:18.368
What about him?

12:38.181 --> 12:39.087
What are you doing?

12:40.740 --> 12:43.127
- You just said...
- I didn’t invite you to come in.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.246
I asked if you wanted to.

12:46.608 --> 12:47.433
Thanks for the ride.

13:00.608 --> 13:01.493
Hi honey.

13:02.992 --> 13:03.965
I looked for you.

13:04.169 --> 13:07.918
Yeah, we were busy at the café. Which is a good thing, right?

13:08.174 --> 13:08.894
Sure.

13:09.592 --> 13:10.246
Luke!

13:12.481 --> 13:14.031
I’m sorry I missed it.

13:16.304 --> 13:17.375
Yeah, me too.

13:54.382 --> 13:55.251
I’m sorry.

13:58.228 --> 14:01.294
Peyton’s not here right now. Just her lame music.

14:01.428 --> 14:03.127
Look, I’m really sorry.

14:03.988 --> 14:07.470
It’s just… this guy’s on the team now, and my dad’s been hammering me about it.

14:08.652 --> 14:10.281
But I shouldn’t take it out on you.

14:10.935 --> 14:11.842
I know that.

14:17.162 --> 14:19.814
- Nathan, I’m tired of this.
- I know. I just…

14:20.247 --> 14:23.107
Look, I haven’t been very good to you lately and I just wanted to say…

14:23.597 --> 14:25.702
that I’m sorry, okay?

14:27.520 --> 14:31.513
Just say it’s okay so that when I see you tomorrow we can start being us again.

14:31.666 --> 14:32.491
Okay, Peyton?

14:35.788 --> 14:36.561
Okay.

15:10.102 --> 15:13.164
Early in his career, Hemingway was frustrated.

15:13.784 --> 15:16.452
He was a good writer who wanted to be great.

15:16.984 --> 15:20.373
And eventually, he discovered that less was more.

15:22.852 --> 15:23.578
Peyton.

15:24.761 --> 15:27.173
Describe Lucas using just one word.

15:32.257 --> 15:33.282
Choke.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.247
Okay, be quiet please. Thank you.

15:37.535 --> 15:40.075
Lucas, care to respond and describe Peyton?

15:44.350 --> 15:45.247
Lonely.

15:46.937 --> 15:48.708
Okay, be quiet please.

15:52.763 --> 15:54.402
Yes? Nathan?

15:55.308 --> 15:56.926
I can describe Lucas in one word.

15:58.328 --> 15:59.485
Bastard.

16:00.601 --> 16:02.045
Alright, alright, alright.

16:05.906 --> 16:07.734
Knock it off. Knock it off!

16:10.799 --> 16:14.681
I’d stand up and every time I do, somebody kicks me in the ass

16:14.748 --> 16:16.771
for putting you on the team. Sit down!

16:20.636 --> 16:23.022
Boy, I must be getting senile.

16:23.626 --> 16:26.817
Because I thought just maybe you were different.

16:27.241 --> 16:29.703
I stuck my neck out for you.

16:30.027 --> 16:31.597
Damnit! I trusted you.

16:32.489 --> 16:35.812
- I shouldn’t have hit him. You’re right.
- Damn right, I’m right.

16:37.819 --> 16:40.825
- I don’t think I can do this.
- Right.

16:41.562 --> 16:46.180
- One bad game and you just run away.
- I didn’t run away.

16:48.197 --> 16:49.897
That’s why I’m in your office.

16:51.715 --> 16:53.297
So what happened after you tackled him?

16:53.671 --> 16:54.742
Kelly broke it up.

16:55.397 --> 16:56.943
Any longer I might’ve destroyed him.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.144
Or he might’ve beaten your ass.

17:00.491 --> 17:01.961
What do you know about it, Jygalski?

17:03.466 --> 17:05.251
What do any of us know about anything?

17:06.117 --> 17:09.051
But if I had do take a guess, I’d say that he tackled you first.

17:09.507 --> 17:12.328
And I’m pretty sure that you were at the bottom of it when Mr. Kelly broke it up.

17:14.550 --> 17:17.898
Well, you’re wrong. Why don’t you grab a rebound every now and then, huh?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.464
What, are you putting on makeup?

17:21.032 --> 17:23.260
Get out in the gym and start warming up.

17:24.063 --> 17:28.191
Jygalski, when you find the pumps to match your skirt,

17:28.455 --> 17:30.510
you might meet us in the gym.

17:31.365 --> 17:32.409
Lets go.

17:37.550 --> 17:42.127
- Hey. This is just the start of it for you.
- Nathan!

17:56.293 --> 17:57.354
Any side effects?

17:58.427 --> 18:00.318
- From what?
- Your amnesia.

18:00.948 --> 18:01.921
What are you talking about?

18:02.060 --> 18:05.347
I’m talking about how you must’ve gotten amnesia because I know

18:05.403 --> 18:07.472
that you would’ve mentioned that you got into a fight today.

18:08.184 --> 18:09.949
- Are you okay, Luke?
- Yeah.

18:11.685 --> 18:15.105
You ever wake up from a really good dream and try to get back to sleep?

18:15.727 --> 18:20.395
Or you got the flu and you promise yourself that you’d appreciate normal so much more

18:20.440 --> 18:22.560
- if you could just get back to it.
- Yeah.

18:23.359 --> 18:24.408
That’s the way I feel.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.772
I just want things to go back to the way they were.

18:28.521 --> 18:29.595
With basketball?

18:30.552 --> 18:31.701
With everything.

18:36.435 --> 18:40.660
You know, it’s really too bad Lucas is poor and he can’t play because he is fine.

18:43.634 --> 18:46.143
Hey, I think it’s really good that you’re fighting with Nathan again.

18:46.762 --> 18:48.145
- You do?
- Yeah.

18:48.329 --> 18:50.482
Every time you guys fight I get to hear new music.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.984
Hey, did you buy the new Beyonce?

18:56.394 --> 18:57.269
No.

18:58.611 --> 19:03.470
You know, Peyton, I know you’re all Gwen Stefani, plaid skirt, I’m a badass,

19:04.130 --> 19:06.213
but we love you anyway, and you know why?

19:06.423 --> 19:09.501
Because Friday night, when it is game time, there you are.

19:10.075 --> 19:11.180
One of us.

19:11.742 --> 19:14.635
P.S. Gwen Stefani is not a badass.

19:18.072 --> 19:19.581
You ever look past it, Brooke?

19:19.987 --> 19:21.798
- Past what?
- All of it.

19:22.316 --> 19:26.726
High school, basketball, and just… the whole popularity drama.

19:27.765 --> 19:28.496
Yeah.

19:29.816 --> 19:33.228
I mean, I think about the future sometimes and it scares me.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.741
But then I think I’ll go to college…

19:40.287 --> 19:43.642
I’ll join the right sorority… I’ll marry a rich guy.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.856
Unless I get fat.

19:51.292 --> 19:54.911
Look, it’s only one game, Luke. Even Jordan played lousy in his first pro game.

19:56.272 --> 19:58.545
Michael Jordan scored 16 points in his first pro game.

19:59.068 --> 20:01.153
Yeah. I know that. I just didn’t think you did.

20:01.214 --> 20:03.973
All I’m saying is, you know, you’ve got to shake it off.

20:05.627 --> 20:06.983
What if I can’t do it, Keith?

20:07.654 --> 20:10.553
- I mean, maybe I can’t play at this level.
- You can.

20:10.629 --> 20:13.977
Well maybe not. And plus, it’s all of them.

20:14.566 --> 20:16.455
I don’t fit into their world. I never will.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.701
It’s stupid.

20:19.792 --> 20:23.388
Even Jordan got cut from his high school varsity team. And he did okay.

20:24.540 --> 20:25.759
What’s your mom say about it?

20:26.204 --> 20:27.376
I haven’t talked to her yet.

20:28.032 --> 20:30.004
- Well, you should.
- Why?

20:30.535 --> 20:34.647
Because she deserves it. I mean, she’s going through this thing, too. You’re not the only one.

20:39.055 --> 20:42.905
It’s a rule of life. The prettier the girl, the messier the car.

20:44.006 --> 20:45.005
It’s a real turnoff, huh?

21:10.032 --> 21:11.098
Those are my sketches!

21:11.558 --> 21:13.699
Um… I wasn’t looking.

21:14.021 --> 21:17.574
This is personal. Alright, I don’t read your diary!

21:17.968 --> 21:19.422
- I don’t have a diary.
- No?

21:19.777 --> 21:24.578
Dear Diary, my daddy doesn’t love me. P.S. Stay out of my stuff!

21:34.782 --> 21:36.319
What’s this I hear about a fight?

21:37.235 --> 21:37.880
Nothing.

21:38.469 --> 21:40.859
- Did you win?
- Dad, it was nothing.

21:41.018 --> 21:43.501
No, son, it was something. Because if it was nothing,

21:43.558 --> 21:45.467
the principal wouldn’t have called me at the dealership.

21:45.817 --> 21:49.318
Do you realize how fast a suspension or bad reputation can ruin your prospects?

21:49.425 --> 21:50.931
Dad, he was hitting on my girlfriend!

21:51.648 --> 21:53.558
- What do you want me to do?
- Your girlfriend?

21:54.198 --> 21:58.032
Nathan, if you’re going to get in a fight, get in a fight over something important.

21:59.455 --> 22:00.521
Did you get hurt?

22:01.427 --> 22:02.087
No.

22:02.532 --> 22:03.731
Okay, good.

22:05.374 --> 22:06.210
Did you?

22:07.853 --> 22:09.963
Me? Why?

22:11.257 --> 22:12.789
He wasn’t swinging at me, Dad…

22:13.551 --> 22:15.319
he was swinging at you.

22:18.938 --> 22:23.392
So, you gonna tell me about the fight or you wanna just assume I know about it while I yell at you?

22:24.268 --> 22:25.558
Is that the phone? I’ll get it.

22:27.560 --> 22:28.512
Still here.

22:28.926 --> 22:30.247
Mom, he had it coming.

22:31.082 --> 22:32.194
- You know he said...
- No.

22:33.032 --> 22:36.596
When they called me today, I was certain they had the wrong Scott.

22:37.068 --> 22:40.073
And then they told me they had two Scotts and I could take my pick.

22:40.314 --> 22:42.848
Honestly, Lucas, fighting in class? Fighting at all?

22:42.930 --> 22:46.283
- The guy was being a jerk.
- And this is suddenly a surprise to you?

22:46.382 --> 22:49.105
- He hasn’t been a jerk before?
- No. He’s always a jerk.

22:49.197 --> 22:50.533
So why go down to his level?

22:54.061 --> 22:56.739
This wouldn’t have anything to do with playing poorly, would it?

22:57.143 --> 22:59.888
How would you know? You weren’t even there.

23:04.026 --> 23:05.229
I’m sorry. Mom…

23:05.960 --> 23:07.169
Mom! I’m so...

23:49.861 --> 23:50.879
How’d you sleep?

23:52.800 --> 23:53.786
Not so good.

23:55.585 --> 23:58.821
I had this really bad dream where I as a jackass to my mom.

24:01.018 --> 24:01.944
- Listen.
- Listen.

24:02.537 --> 24:03.802
- Ooh.
- Jinx.

24:08.507 --> 24:11.068
- Sorry.
- No. I’m sorry.

24:11.303 --> 24:13.694
I should’ve told you the truth about why I couldn’t be there.

24:13.899 --> 24:18.278
I really wanted to Luke, but the idea of walking into that gym…

24:21.856 --> 24:24.585
That’s where he told me he was going away to college without me.

24:26.243 --> 24:27.728
That’s where everything changed.

24:33.693 --> 24:38.255
I don’t regret one second of one day with you, okay?

24:38.577 --> 24:43.011
I don’t. But that day was a hard day in that gym.

24:45.203 --> 24:47.588
And it was basketball that he chose.

24:49.294 --> 24:53.303
And I’m sorry that you have to hear things like that, but I don’t want to lie to you either.

24:57.444 --> 24:58.873
I’m sorry you had to live it.

25:05.358 --> 25:08.095
Look, I want to talk about what’s happening with the team.

25:08.206 --> 25:11.013
I know you think I’ve been hard on you, but that’s because I see the big picture here.

25:11.366 --> 25:13.992
Whitey’s not going to bench this kid just because of one bad game.

25:14.453 --> 25:17.219
So what? Let him humiliate himself.

25:17.489 --> 25:18.596
No. It’s more than that.

25:19.441 --> 25:23.567
Back when I played for Whitey, his word was law. He was always right.

25:23.767 --> 25:27.048
Even when he was wrong. So eventually I called him on it.

25:27.305 --> 25:28.947
And he benched you in the state championship.

25:29.041 --> 25:32.180
Yeah, so he claimed. He covered and acted like he benched me.

25:32.604 --> 25:35.860
But you should know the truth. I refused to go back in that game.

25:37.304 --> 25:39.745
We were ahead in the fourth quarter, and Whitey wanted to stall.

25:39.814 --> 25:41.272
What did I tell you about playing with the lead?

25:41.410 --> 25:43.280
- Be aggressive.
- Exactly. Be aggressive.

25:43.756 --> 25:47.119
Plus, there were scouts who were there to see me. This guy was checking me.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.664
He was going to some big college back in Tinkham, so I did.

25:50.376 --> 25:52.167
I disobeyed Whitey and I scored on him.

25:53.638 --> 25:55.132
- Nice.
- Yeah.

25:57.519 --> 26:01.297
Yeah, so Whitey called a time out and starts screaming about how it’s his system

26:01.348 --> 26:03.795
that got us there and no one player was bigger than the team.

26:04.052 --> 26:05.767
So I sat down and I called his bluff.

26:06.970 --> 26:08.015
And they lost.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.677
Yeah, I felt bad for the guys.

26:11.096 --> 26:16.472
But he needed to know I’m the one who got us there. Not him and not his system.

26:18.131 --> 26:21.306
Listen, Nathan, I don’t want you to back off this kid.

26:21.390 --> 26:25.085
No matter how poorly he plays, Whitey’s just using him to get back at me.

26:25.372 --> 26:29.120
Eventually I’ll deal with Whitey but for now, it’s just you and me, okay?

26:29.647 --> 26:30.682
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:34.449 --> 26:35.207
Hey Lucas.

26:36.077 --> 26:37.732
Tough game the other night.

26:39.257 --> 26:39.989
Yeah.

26:40.465 --> 26:41.269
It happens.

26:42.944 --> 26:46.200
- So you read a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

26:47.014 --> 26:48.270
Yeah, I got something for you.

26:49.805 --> 26:52.789
Listen, I know we haven’t had really had a chance to talk much since you joined the team but...

26:52.841 --> 26:56.451
I just kinda wanted to stay out of your way, give you a chance to chill, you know.

26:56.938 --> 26:58.346
Oh, I’m Jake.

26:59.232 --> 27:00.521
Yeah, I know.

27:01.616 --> 27:03.629
A lot of talk about your one on one with Nathan.

27:04.755 --> 27:07.730
- Man, I wish I could’ve been there.
- Ah. It was no big deal.

27:07.940 --> 27:09.122
You know Nathan, he’s…

27:09.768 --> 27:11.790
he’s a hell of player he really is. But...

27:12.851 --> 27:14.949
he buys into all of this nonsense.

27:15.461 --> 27:16.506
You’ve got him scared.

27:18.825 --> 27:20.300
Fear changes everything.

27:24.846 --> 27:26.669
- Atlas Shrugged?
- Yeah, you read it?

27:26.752 --> 27:28.005
- No.
- It’s good.

27:28.788 --> 27:29.920
Anyway, you’re gonna be fine.

27:31.752 --> 27:34.697
Just remember… don’t let him take it.

27:35.435 --> 27:37.396
- I don’t know what that means.
- Yeah, I know.

27:38.122 --> 27:39.393
But you will.

27:45.741 --> 27:49.029
Okay, we’re going to try our little Hemingway project again.

27:49.745 --> 27:53.748
But in order to avoid a bar fight, we’re going to do it on paper.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.956
Now you don’t have to put your names on these.

27:56.233 --> 28:00.257
Simply write one word, one single word,

28:00.502 --> 28:04.896
to describe what you want most in your life right now.

28:20.977 --> 28:22.426
It’s like this.

28:27.777 --> 28:28.894
You can’t do it, can you?

28:35.268 --> 28:36.117
It’s beautiful.

28:37.521 --> 28:38.596
I always wondered about it?

28:39.672 --> 28:40.768
We all do, right?

28:45.929 --> 28:47.633
What happens when it’s gone?

28:48.196 --> 28:50.265
But see, I’ve never seen anybody lose it.

28:51.053 --> 28:52.297
Like really lose it...

28:53.619 --> 28:54.699
until now.

29:01.411 --> 29:02.231
Go ahead, man.

29:03.976 --> 29:04.871
Prove me wrong.

29:07.002 --> 29:08.409
I don’t have to prove anything to you.

29:08.881 --> 29:09.746
That’s pathetic.

29:11.021 --> 29:14.147
And it’s too bad, really. I mean, I was looking forward to taking you down slowly,

29:14.237 --> 29:16.935
but now? Hell, what’s the point?

29:18.152 --> 29:19.471
You already know it’s over.

29:20.737 --> 29:24.051
I’d say see you at practice, but we both know you’re not going to be there.

29:25.267 --> 29:26.965
Why humiliate yourself, right?

29:34.113 --> 29:35.055
You missed again.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.256
Scott! Lucas Scott!

29:47.425 --> 29:50.496
One more time! Lucas Scott!

29:59.073 --> 30:00.297
No practice today?

30:10.588 --> 30:11.746
What, are you stalking me?

30:12.262 --> 30:15.043
- I thought someone should see them.
- Well, it’s none of your business.

30:17.291 --> 30:20.218
You know what? You’re right. It’s none of my business.

30:21.422 --> 30:24.330
- I wouldn’t know anything about it.
- I know you don’t.

30:26.736 --> 30:30.397
Look, just tell me why you didn’t submit them. Your stuff is good.

30:30.849 --> 30:31.923
It’s not good enough.

30:32.691 --> 30:34.749
Look, Peyton, why not?

30:38.795 --> 30:41.775
I want to draw something that means something to someone.

30:42.205 --> 30:48.400
You know, I want to draw blind faith or a fading summer or… just a moment of clarity.

30:48.998 --> 30:52.951
It’s like when you go and you see a really great band live for the first time, you know,

30:53.182 --> 30:55.910
and nobody’s saying it but everybody’s thinking it --

30:57.072 --> 30:58.752
"We have something to believe in again."

31:01.670 --> 31:04.865
I want to draw that feeling. But, I can’t.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.356
And if I can’t be great at it then I don’t want to ruin it.

31:10.098 --> 31:11.383
It’s too important to me.

31:16.175 --> 31:19.032
Yep. Me too.

31:27.659 --> 31:29.177
Hey, what about your sketchbook?

31:30.313 --> 31:33.563
What about them? They don’t mean anything to anybody, do they?

31:45.150 --> 31:48.694
People who value their lives usually knock first.

31:51.027 --> 31:54.411
Oh. That explains it.

31:56.358 --> 31:59.705
- It’s like a time capsule in here.
- What can I do for you, Danny.

32:00.745 --> 32:01.478
Well…

32:03.306 --> 32:04.534
you can let it go.

32:06.691 --> 32:09.619
That’s definitely the pot calling the kettle black, isn’t it?

32:10.008 --> 32:13.371
If you’ve got a problem with me, Whitey, don’t take it out on Nathan.

32:13.475 --> 32:15.517
What problem would that be, Danny?

32:15.992 --> 32:17.294
Oh. I think you know.

32:18.210 --> 32:19.541
State championship.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.352
Now you’ve gone and humiliated Karen’s son in some feeble attempt to get even.

32:25.583 --> 32:26.653
Karen’s son.

32:27.877 --> 32:30.452
That’s a very convenient way of putting it.

32:31.870 --> 32:35.996
It might interest you to know that Karen’s son has taken himself off the team.

32:37.816 --> 32:39.422
Does that make you happy, Danny?

32:39.781 --> 32:43.574
Seeing the demise of the kid you fathered and then abandoned?

32:47.370 --> 32:51.506
Hey, move Nathan back to shooting guard and you might finally win that state championship.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.726
You’re just destroying kids’ lives left and right, aren’t you?

32:55.485 --> 32:57.368
Well, you’ve made a career out of it.

33:58.004 --> 33:59.377
Missed you at practice.

34:00.965 --> 34:01.984
I can’t do it.

34:03.090 --> 34:04.241
You want to know something?

34:05.449 --> 34:08.833
I have had 35 winning seasons.

34:09.561 --> 34:11.359
Do you know what keeps me up at night?

34:12.779 --> 34:14.737
College jobs I never took.

34:15.771 --> 34:17.670
Could’ve beens have a way of doing that.

34:20.108 --> 34:20.871
Yeah.

34:21.335 --> 34:22.940
We got a game tomorrow night.

34:23.897 --> 34:26.175
You’re on my team until tip-off.

34:27.272 --> 34:29.033
The rest is up to you.

34:36.677 --> 34:37.668
Look, son.

34:40.275 --> 34:42.329
There’s no shame in being afraid.

34:43.317 --> 34:44.786
Hell, we’re all afraid.

34:45.550 --> 34:50.152
What you’ve got to do is figure out what you’re afraid of.

34:51.391 --> 34:55.498
Because when you put a face on it, you can beat it.

34:56.688 --> 34:59.952
Or better yet, you can use it.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.034
Think about it.

35:13.828 --> 35:15.461
You’ve got some ugly toes, girl.

35:15.911 --> 35:19.015
- No I don’t.
- Yeah, you do. They’re like practically fingers.

35:19.275 --> 35:20.956
Well, then just focus on the middle one.

35:22.230 --> 35:25.241
Aw, come on. I was just joking. I love your toes.

35:30.278 --> 35:32.214
So I’m thinking about quitting the team.

35:32.577 --> 35:34.831
- Right.
- No, I’m serious.

35:35.076 --> 35:38.276
I don’t even like it anymore. Whitey can’t stand me.

35:38.859 --> 35:40.356
It’s never good enough for my dad.

35:41.573 --> 35:45.490
I think you should. Why not, right? I mean, you can quit the team

35:45.558 --> 35:49.074
and I’ll quit cheerleading and then… we can just walk away from it.

35:50.850 --> 35:52.270
Nathan, lets do it!

35:53.427 --> 35:56.217
Yeah, right. That’s what I’m gonna do.

35:57.052 --> 35:59.800
I gotta go. I’ll see you at the game.

36:08.279 --> 36:10.194
Did you ever figure out your porn name?

36:11.203 --> 36:12.923
- What are you talking about?
- Your porn name.

36:13.441 --> 36:17.132
You know, you take the name of your first pet and your mother’s maiden name

36:17.184 --> 36:19.933
and you put them together. What was the name of your first pet?

36:20.377 --> 36:25.374
- You know that. I had a dog named Rocket.
- Oh, Rocket! Ah! I loved Rocket.

36:25.920 --> 36:30.435
So your mother’s maiden name is Roe. Rocket Roe!

36:31.484 --> 36:33.122
- Nice.
- What’s yours?

36:33.322 --> 36:36.256
Oh, I had a bunny, named Bunny.

36:36.751 --> 36:38.695
-  You had a Bunny named Bunny?
- Yes I did.

36:38.791 --> 36:42.163
And my mother’s maiden name is Beaugard. So…

36:42.947 --> 36:44.539
- Bunny Beaugard.
- Bunny Beaugard.

36:44.837 --> 36:48.113
Dawson’s Freak. Starring Rocket Roe and Bunny Beaugard.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.052
- Nice.
- Shut up!

36:51.933 --> 36:56.138
Hey, this game tonight.

36:57.268 --> 36:58.415
You’re not playing anymore...

36:59.572 --> 37:00.300
No.

37:06.151 --> 37:08.635
You know I’ve never walked away from anything before, Haley?

37:09.127 --> 37:11.420
- Yeah.
- But I can’t do it.

37:11.655 --> 37:14.526
And even worse, I don’t know why I can’t do it.

37:16.059 --> 37:20.928
You know, it’s like, no matter how confusing or screwed up life got,

37:21.681 --> 37:24.911
the game always made sense. It was mine, you know.

37:25.454 --> 37:27.349
And in a lot of ways it’s who I am.

37:28.408 --> 37:32.611
But I can’t be that person in their gym,

37:33.303 --> 37:37.594
or in their uniforms, or… in their world.

37:37.763 --> 37:38.838
I hear you, Luke.

37:39.934 --> 37:41.353
But I know you.

37:42.160 --> 37:46.097
And I know that no matter what happens you’re still going to be the same guy you always were.

37:48.223 --> 37:55.651
No uniform, no… whatever is gonna ruin that, you know?

37:58.288 --> 38:00.316
Call me later. We’ll go get some pizza.

38:24.747 --> 38:28.527
I took the night off. Thought I’d take in a basketball game.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.236
Sorry, Mom.

38:32.874 --> 38:34.830
No, Luke. I’m sorry.

38:36.677 --> 38:38.690
I’ve always loved the game.

38:39.941 --> 38:41.563
Even in the junior leagues.

38:42.034 --> 38:44.902
I remember when they issued you your first jersey.

38:45.418 --> 38:48.122
And I couldn’t get you out of that. You wore that thing for weeks.

38:50.815 --> 38:52.694
And then you decided to quit playing.

38:54.937 --> 38:56.037
Do you remember why?

39:01.333 --> 39:02.248
Lucas?

39:04.234 --> 39:06.149
I didn’t want to see his face.

39:07.286 --> 39:08.132
Dan.

39:09.106 --> 39:12.146
I didn’t want to be like him. And…

39:14.562 --> 39:18.469
I was afraid that I’d become him if I played.

39:22.702 --> 39:27.945
In the gym, I felt like he had a piece of me.

39:29.513 --> 39:31.642
I never felt like that on the playground.

39:33.590 --> 39:37.312
Well, I’d say he’s taken enough from us.

39:38.929 --> 39:41.515
I took the night off to watch my son play again.

39:42.533 --> 39:45.512
The way that he used to when he loved the game more than anything.

39:54.387 --> 39:55.185
Mom?

39:59.102 --> 39:59.835
Thank you.

40:02.244 --> 40:06.990
It’s hard to fight the things that we’re afraid of. Sometimes we just need a little help.

40:18.337 --> 40:19.557
Hey! Hold on!

40:23.017 --> 40:24.533
Here Could you take a look at these?

40:25.828 --> 40:26.937
You won’t be disappointed.

40:27.078 --> 40:28.059
Sure. Okay.

40:40.487 --> 40:41.854
It’s time to focus now, Nathan.

40:42.683 --> 40:44.547
Put everything out of your mind that bothers you.

40:45.776 --> 40:49.195
I don’t want you thinking about Whitey. I don’t want you thinking about your teammates.

40:49.750 --> 40:51.403
Let them think about you, son.

40:52.355 --> 40:54.855
The other team's thinking about you. And they’re scared.

40:55.365 --> 40:56.630
I’ll see you at the game.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.090
I was beginning to think you weren’t going to show.

41:08.350 --> 41:11.182
It’s game night. Where else would I be?

41:15.415 --> 41:16.800
Uh, son!

41:24.820 --> 41:26.353
Give this to my boy, would you?

41:39.197 --> 41:40.413
Don’t let him take it.

41:42.768 --> 41:43.776
Your talent.

41:46.659 --> 41:47.771
It’s all yours.

41:58.837 --> 42:03.468
Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark

42:05.143 --> 42:08.603
in the hopeless swaps of the not quite, the not yet, and the not at all.

42:13.304 --> 42:15.413
Do not let the hero in your soul perish

42:17.359 --> 42:19.826
in lonely frustration for the life you deserved

42:23.023 --> 42:24.424
and have never been able to reach.

42:32.639 --> 42:34.430
The world you desire can be won.

42:37.543 --> 42:38.362
It exists.

42:40.354 --> 42:41.315
It is real.

42:42.657 --> 42:43.450
Don’t choke.

42:44.347 --> 42:45.422
It is possible.

42:49.954 --> 42:51.540
It is yours.

42:51.648 --> 42:53.130
Your art matters.

42:53.898 --> 42:55.756
It’s what got me here.

42:59.984 --> 43:03.768
Lets go, lets go! Ravens on three! One, two, three! Ravens!

43:04.950 --> 43:06.271
You’re gonna be okay.

43:06.771 --> 43:08.154
Yeah, I am.
