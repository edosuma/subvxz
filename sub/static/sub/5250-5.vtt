07:22.715 --> 07:24.050

07:24.050 --> 07:25.585

07:25.585 --> 07:26.886
crying, saying, like,

07:26.886 --> 07:29.822
"I can't wait to die!"

07:29.822 --> 07:31.324
I can't do it, Cissy did it better.

Even back then she was
good with impressions.

07:33.826 --> 07:35.595
Did Cissy always sing?

07:35.595 --> 07:37.163
Oh, those skits give me a tickle.

07:37.163 --> 07:39.131
Oh, I love to laugh!

07:39.131 --> 07:41.667
- Laughter feels good.
- It's very important.

07:50.643 --> 07:51.878
Cissy could make some time for you.

07:51.878 --> 07:53.112
I promise you.

07:53.112 --> 07:55.715
Julie, you should make a YouTube.

07:55.715 --> 07:57.283

07:59.852 --> 08:01.120

08:01.120 --> 08:02.588
Julie, did you ever think maybe

08:02.588 --> 08:03.789
you're not successful because you're

08:03.789 --> 08:05.324
constantly moving around

08:05.324 --> 08:07.226
from one thing to another?

08:07.226 --> 08:09.228
You're right, Mom. You know what?

08:09.228 --> 08:12.565
I'm gonna go home and focus on one thing.

14:44.223 --> 14:45.858
for the show biz stuff I do.

14:45.858 --> 14:47.627
(phone vibrating)

14:47.627 --> 14:48.961
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm in a little bit

14:48.961 --> 14:50.396
of a situation here.

14:50.396 --> 14:51.998
What's going on? What's that noise?

14:51.998 --> 14:53.366
I gave Matthew the week off

14:53.366 --> 14:54.634
and because we got some press,

14:54.634 --> 14:56.769
actual children have
been showing up, a lot.

14:56.769 --> 14:58.337
- What?
- I know.

14:58.337 --> 14:59.572
I guess if you put "children" in the name

14:59.572 --> 15:01.374
of your restaurant and you serve hot dogs,

15:01.374 --> 15:02.508
parents will bring their kids to it

15:02.508 --> 15:03.643
like it's that goddamn field

15:03.643 --> 15:04.977
in that Kevin Costner movie.

15:04.977 --> 15:06.812
"Tin Cup"? Oh, there's no time for jokes.

15:06.812 --> 15:07.980
You have your SNL showcase.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.382
I'll be right over.

15:09.382 --> 15:11.984
(light applause)

15:17.423 --> 15:19.258
- Tough crowd.
- Did they laugh?

15:19.258 --> 15:20.993
- No. Way over their heads.
- I know, but that's

15:20.993 --> 15:22.428
what they do, they don't laugh.

15:22.428 --> 15:23.729
I've heard that they never laugh.

15:23.729 --> 15:24.964
Okay, well, now I know how Susan Lucci

15:24.964 --> 15:26.532
must have felt when she took over

15:26.532 --> 15:29.368
for Bernadette Peters
in "Annie Get Your Gun."

15:29.368 --> 15:30.703
God, I should have said that on stage.

15:30.703 --> 15:32.338
No, you shouldn't have.

15:32.338 --> 15:34.373
I didn't expect Lorne Michaels to be here.

15:34.373 --> 15:35.875
What? No, Matthew.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.476
Are you serious?

15:37.476 --> 15:38.444
Matthew.

15:38.444 --> 15:39.745
Matthew!

15:39.745 --> 15:41.714
Does Lorne come to this?

15:41.714 --> 15:43.549
(phone dings)

15:46.385 --> 15:47.687
- _
- Please welcome to the stage

15:47.687 --> 15:49.555
Billy Epstein.

15:49.555 --> 15:51.957
(scattered applause)

15:53.826 --> 15:56.362
Hey guys. Uh, I'm Billy Epstein.

15:56.362 --> 15:57.897
(children giggling)

15:57.897 --> 15:59.765
Oh, uh, we're still waiting on apple juice.

15:59.765 --> 16:01.867
Madam, this is my own personal hell.

16:01.867 --> 16:04.437
How can this place not have any sippy cups?

16:04.437 --> 16:06.472
Because you don't have

16:06.472 --> 16:08.507
a children's menu restaurant

16:08.507 --> 16:09.675
for children!

16:09.675 --> 16:13.312
You have it for me.

16:13.312 --> 16:16.716
I can't wait to die!

16:16.551 --> 16:20.155
♪

16:20.155 --> 16:21.556
Oo, are you Ariel?

16:21.556 --> 16:22.724
Don't be an idiot

16:22.724 --> 16:24.359
and don't touch strangers!

16:24.359 --> 16:26.995
Go over there.

16:26.995 --> 16:28.496
Jesus Christ.

16:28.496 --> 16:29.597
Are you okay, here?

16:29.597 --> 16:31.232
Oh, thank God you're here.

16:31.232 --> 16:32.434
Just to catch you up,

16:32.434 --> 16:34.002
I'm still a terrible babysitter,

16:34.002 --> 16:35.570
apparently children like grabbing my hair,

16:35.570 --> 16:37.272
and Arthur'll be here any minute.

16:37.272 --> 16:38.306
How was the showcase?

16:38.306 --> 16:40.275
It was good. Lorne was there.

16:40.275 --> 16:42.177
Are you serious? Oh my God.

16:42.177 --> 16:43.511
And I was actually pretty happy

16:43.511 --> 16:44.979
with what I did

16:44.979 --> 16:46.247
and then the second I got off stage,

16:46.247 --> 16:47.382
they told me I didn't get it.

16:47.382 --> 16:48.616
Oh, no.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.151
Who can I cyber bully?

16:50.151 --> 16:51.453
- What can I punch?
- It's okay.

16:51.453 --> 16:53.054
I feel pretty good about it

16:53.054 --> 16:54.589
and they said I should keep trying

16:54.589 --> 16:57.325
and then they said I'm
pretty green still. So.

16:57.325 --> 16:58.526
Well, that's good feedback

16:58.526 --> 17:00.128
and I have to say, it's nice that

17:00.128 --> 17:02.397
one of us is too young
for something for once.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.631
True. All right, now let's get

17:03.631 --> 17:05.032
to the shit show at hand.

17:05.032 --> 17:06.000
How the fuck do we get these kids

17:06.000 --> 17:06.733
out of the restaurant?

17:06.733 --> 17:08.169
Um, what do kids hate?

17:08.169 --> 17:09.304
Jazz.

17:09.304 --> 17:11.473
Uh, the dentist.

17:11.473 --> 17:12.740
Homework.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.242
Kevin Spacey.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.242
Oh, the news.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.176
Maybe we can put on the news.

17:16.176 --> 17:17.444
- Perfect.
- Okay.

17:17.444 --> 17:19.314
New York local news is the scariest.

17:19.314 --> 17:21.683
Police say the unidentified victim's corpse

17:21.683 --> 17:23.685
was partially cannibalized

17:23.685 --> 17:26.087
and her eyes were sewn shut.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.189
- Coming up... 
- Surprise!

17:28.189 --> 17:30.391
Oh, my lucid nightmare has a punchline.

17:30.391 --> 17:32.660
Look at this restaurant.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.996
It's so nice to see you succeed

17:34.996 --> 17:36.397
in some way.

17:36.397 --> 17:38.199
Julie, you're gonna love me.

17:38.199 --> 17:40.168
Look what I brought.

17:40.168 --> 17:41.636
Hi! I'm Cissy.

17:41.636 --> 17:43.204
My mom said you used to babysit me,

17:43.204 --> 17:44.572
but I can't remember.

17:44.572 --> 17:46.641
What a natural storyteller you are.

17:46.641 --> 17:48.543
She is, that's right, yes.

17:48.543 --> 17:50.111
You know what, hon? Julie's trying to be

17:50.111 --> 17:51.446
a stand-up comedian, can you help her out?

17:51.446 --> 17:52.514
Aww.

17:52.514 --> 17:53.681
It'd be nice if you could

17:53.681 --> 17:54.682
give her some advice.

17:54.682 --> 17:55.984
You know, coming from someone

17:55.984 --> 17:57.519
who's doing as well as you.

17:57.519 --> 17:59.087
Well, what is it you wanna do?

17:59.087 --> 18:00.321
Like, what is your brand?

18:00.321 --> 18:02.991
She's not sure, it always changes.

18:04.425 --> 18:06.928
Help her.

18:06.928 --> 18:08.930
Do you wanna see her on the YouTube?

18:08.930 --> 18:11.633
I made a YouTube video with my dogs.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.369
But it didn't get as many views as yours.

18:14.369 --> 18:17.672
Oh, well, I believe in myself, so...

18:17.672 --> 18:20.108
Oh no no, I believe in myself,

18:20.108 --> 18:22.577
I've just lost faith
in the world around me.

18:22.577 --> 18:24.312
I do not get people like you.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.180
You are so negative.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.182
Don't you know that you just have to decide

18:28.182 --> 18:29.951
to be successful?

18:29.951 --> 18:31.085
You know what, Cissy,

18:31.085 --> 18:32.420
you millennial nuisance,

18:32.420 --> 18:34.088
you're 19 and you're having a moment.

18:34.088 --> 18:35.523
But we will bury you.

18:35.523 --> 18:37.258
You don't have the
strength to last in comedy.

18:37.258 --> 18:38.526
She's one of those people,

18:38.526 --> 18:39.561
"Oh, I'll make it happen for myself.

18:39.561 --> 18:41.062
I'll do my own show!"

18:41.062 --> 18:42.096
"Yeah, don't wait around for a network

18:42.096 --> 18:43.031
to give you a show!"

18:43.031 --> 18:44.299
"Oh, I know what I'll do.

18:44.299 --> 18:45.633
I'll make my own show on my phone!"

18:45.633 --> 18:47.268
"Remember 'Full House'? So do I.

18:47.268 --> 18:48.570
Isn't that funny?"

18:48.570 --> 18:51.573
"I'm so hilarious, I was born in 1996."

18:51.573 --> 18:53.408
Okay, now I'll be you two.

18:53.408 --> 18:56.244
"Wah, I'm old. Wah, I'm lonely."

18:56.244 --> 18:59.147
Oh, see, that's where you're wrong, Cissy.

18:59.147 --> 19:02.350
Because I have a boyfriend.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.918
Yes you do.

19:03.918 --> 19:05.420
And I'm here to help.

19:05.420 --> 19:09.057
Uh... helping hands for
all the hungry children.

19:09.057 --> 19:10.725
A new sketch of the child molester

19:10.725 --> 19:12.694
who's been terrorizing schools.

19:12.694 --> 19:15.263
It has been distributed
to local communities

19:15.263 --> 19:16.531
and the hope is that authorities

19:16.531 --> 19:18.266
will receive a tip and bring

19:18.266 --> 19:20.668
this horrible monster to justice.

19:20.668 --> 19:23.004
Hey! He looks like me.

19:23.004 --> 19:26.074
(collective gasp)

19:26.074 --> 19:27.408
What the hell's going on?

19:27.408 --> 19:28.343
What's happening?

19:28.343 --> 19:29.944
Denise, hi!

19:29.944 --> 19:31.579
You're back early. How were the Hamptons?

19:31.579 --> 19:33.281
Shut up, Billy.

19:33.281 --> 19:35.483
What did you do to my menu?

19:35.483 --> 19:37.185
And who the hell is that pedophile?

19:37.185 --> 19:39.520
That's my daughter's boyfriend.

19:47.128 --> 19:48.296
(in funny voice) Come on, everybody,

19:48.296 --> 19:50.531
it's time to have fun.

19:54.002 --> 19:55.103
Hi. What's up?

19:55.103 --> 19:56.137
It's your girl, Cissy.

19:56.137 --> 19:57.271
I just got yelled at

19:57.271 --> 19:59.173
by the two meanest meanies

19:59.173 --> 20:00.441
in the whole world.

20:00.441 --> 20:01.442
"Wah!"

20:01.442 --> 20:03.645
Do you guys wanna meet them?

20:03.645 --> 20:05.113
(auto tuned) You know what, Cissy?

20:05.113 --> 20:06.280
We will bury you.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.616
We will bury you underground.

20:08.616 --> 20:10.652
- Cissy.
- We will bury you.

20:10.652 --> 20:13.187
We will bury you underground.

20:13.187 --> 20:15.289
You're 19 and you're having a moment.

20:15.289 --> 20:17.325
Remember "Full House"?

20:17.325 --> 20:19.460
You millennial nuisance.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.095
- Hey!
- Oh, I know everything

20:21.095 --> 20:24.198
'cause I was born in 1996.

20:24.198 --> 20:25.533
How do you even do that?

20:25.533 --> 20:27.001
Yeah, she'll get five million views

20:27.001 --> 20:28.236
and we get nothing.

20:28.236 --> 20:30.104
It's just like The Children's Menu.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.206
Denise made all the money
off of our great idea

20:32.206 --> 20:33.975
and all we get in return
is you're not fired.

20:33.975 --> 20:35.276
Yeah, this is what it must have felt like

20:35.276 --> 20:36.277
for one of those Motown artists

20:36.277 --> 20:37.378
who get screwed over

20:37.378 --> 20:38.479
by white record executives.

20:38.479 --> 20:40.581
Exactly. You know what?

20:40.581 --> 20:42.150
It's time to stop fucking around

20:42.150 --> 20:43.351
with schemes that have nothing to do

20:43.351 --> 20:44.452
with our chosen path

20:44.452 --> 20:45.553
and focus on show business.

20:45.553 --> 20:46.621
You're right. From now on

20:46.621 --> 20:48.056
it's just show business.

20:48.056 --> 20:49.424
Late night tacos.

20:49.424 --> 20:51.259
No tomatoes on yours, Splenda,

20:51.259 --> 20:52.193
or lettuce or cheese.

20:52.193 --> 20:53.227
It's just a tortilla

20:53.227 --> 20:54.395
with unseasoned ground beef.

20:54.395 --> 20:55.963
- Aww.
- Here you go, Billy.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.032
Arthur, what did I ever do to deserve you?

20:58.032 --> 20:59.600
Ah, sometimes I wonder.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.969
Oh, it's 11:35, put on SNL.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.671
I still say it should have been you.

21:03.671 --> 21:05.173
Oh my God, there's a new opening.

21:05.173 --> 21:07.141
It's Saturday Night Live

21:07.141 --> 21:11.141
with Brooklyn Coppola,

21:12.013 --> 21:15.416
Dax Hilton,

21:15.416 --> 21:18.052
Blair Violet Pendelton...

21:18.052 --> 21:20.555
Oh my God, they're so young.

21:20.555 --> 21:22.623
So I wasn't too young.

21:22.623 --> 21:23.991
I was too old.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.626
Ryder Silverman.

21:25.626 --> 21:27.328
Oh, how bold.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.263
I'm gonna keep watching though.

21:29.263 --> 21:30.498
Yeah, I guess.

21:30.498 --> 21:34.535
And your host, the Annoying Orange!

21:34.535 --> 21:35.670
You know, some of his videos

21:35.670 --> 21:37.138
