I don't know why anyone would
miss an episode of Glee,

00:03.921 --> 00:05.755
but here's what's been
happening in case you did.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.423
Quinn's parents
found out she's pregnant,
so they kicked her out.

00:07.508 --> 00:11.719
- I needed my mom.
- So it's decided— you move in with me.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.763
Jesse dropped Rachel and McKinley
and the New Directions...

00:13.847 --> 00:15.807
and he's back on Vocal Adrenaline,
which freaked everybody out...

00:15.891 --> 00:17.600
and convinced them they
can't beat 'em at regionals,

00:17.685 --> 00:20.019
and if they don't place
at regionals the club is over,
which would be awful.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.938
And that's what you missed
on Glee.

00:30.948 --> 00:34.200
Hey, buddy,
see ya on Saturday.
Wait- What?

00:34.284 --> 00:37.286

the show choir governing board
says or does!

00:47.172 --> 00:49.090
Let me break it down
for you, Will.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.176
It's been decided
that this year's regionals
will be judged by celebrities,

00:52.261 --> 00:54.429
and I'm a celebrity now,
William.

00:54.513 --> 00:58.474
Now, I realize my cultural ascendance
only serves to illuminate your own banality.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.644
But face it— I'm a legend.
It's happened.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.772
Do you have any idea
how hard my kids
have been working, Sue?

01:04.857 --> 01:06.774
I have to be honest, Will.

01:06.859 --> 01:11.070
I'm having a really difficult time
hearing anything you have to say today...

01:11.155 --> 01:14.157
because your hair looks
like a briar patch.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.160
I keep expecting
racist animated Disney characters
to pop up and start singing songs...

01:17.244 --> 01:19.120

01:19.204 --> 01:22.749
Principal Figgins, I am begging you,
do not let her do this to those kids.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.252
William, I resent the implication
that I don't play by the rules.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.422
You leaked our set list
at sectionals, Sue!
I have no memory of that.

01:29.506 --> 01:33.342
I will not let you do this.
We have worked ourselves
to the bone to get where we are.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.553
I'm sorry, Will,
but our arrangement stands.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.556
You must win or place at regionals,
or I'm disbanding the club.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.934
lf I were you,
I would spend less time
complaining to me...

01:42.019 --> 01:45.938
and more time convincing
Judge Sylvester that your
New Directions have got the goods.

I took a vow.

and I did them.

"I'm going to crush Glee Club."

are gonna even
acknowledge my existence...

that we loved about Glee Club this year?

were gonna quit teaching
and become an accountant...

that video of yourself
singing at nationals,

was the happiest moment
of your life?

05:11.186 --> 05:13.229
Because I loved
what I was doing.

And isn't that what
you've been drilling
into their heads all year,

05:17.234 --> 05:21.070
that that feeling
is way more important
than winning or losing?

with my oral hygiene.

he was showing me the machines
they use to sterilize their tools...

27:14.800 --> 27:17.635
I thought that brunette
had an amazing voice.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.471
Brunettes have no place
in show business.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.557
Come on.
They're just kids.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.935
That's no excuse.
By the time I was 14
I'd already formed a band.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.687
When Josh Groban
was their age...

27:27.771 --> 27:30.148
he was already in
The Mickey Mouse Club
or something.

27:30.232 --> 27:32.650
As the only educator here,
let me point out...

27:32.735 --> 27:35.778
that not all kids
are afforded the same
opportunities as others.

27:35.863 --> 27:39.490
Is that what you tell yourself
to get to sleep at night?

27:39.575 --> 27:42.618
Some people just simply
don't have talent.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.038
[Chuckles]
You think you're a celebrity.
You're not.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.874
You just try hard.
That's about it.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.418
Olivia Newton-John
has a valid point here.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.130
You have a lot in common
with those kids at your school, Sue.

27:54.214 --> 27:57.633

with delusions of grandeur.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.136
Dagnab it!

28:00.220 --> 28:04.140
Even I have to admit,
I'm a little confused as to
what Sue is doing in this room.

28:04.224 --> 28:07.685
- Wasn't the theme supposed
to be Celebrity Judges?
- Kiss my ass, Josh Groban!

28:07.770 --> 28:09.812
I am an internationally ranked
cheerleading coach!

28:09.897 --> 28:12.148
Who lives in Ohio.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.985
When this is done today,
Josh and I are flying
back to L.A. first class.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.737
You'll be staying here,

28:17.821 --> 28:19.405
just like those kids.

28:19.490 --> 28:22.825
I think we've all made up
our minds. Let's vote.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.960

28:48.185 --> 28:50.561
Thank you all
for coming.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.564
As you all know,
Glee Club is such
an important—

28:53.649 --> 28:57.443
And I honestly can't even
finish that sentence,
so let's just get to it.

29:03.450 --> 29:08.037
The 2010 Midwest
Regional runners-up-

29:09.289 --> 29:11.499
from Fort Wayne,
Indiana,

29:11.583 --> 29:14.627
the not-at-all-stupidly named
Aural Intensity!

29:19.299 --> 29:22.051
[Cheering, Whooping]

29:28.183 --> 29:30.351
[Sue]
Very good.

29:35.983 --> 29:41.737
And now, your 2010
Midwest Regionals
Show Choir champions,

29:52.291 --> 29:55.543

30:28.327 --> 30:30.411
We didn't even place.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.473
She looks like you.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.101
Do you want to keep her?

30:54.186 --> 30:56.604
No.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.439
Do you?

31:01.818 --> 31:03.778
Did you love me?

31:05.239 --> 31:08.658
Yes.
Especially now.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.797
Which one is yours?

31:25.008 --> 31:27.009
What are you doing here?

31:27.094 --> 31:29.720
I see her now.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.974
[Laughs]
She looks like you.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.812
Does she have a name?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.939
No.
Beth.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.691
Pretty.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.028
I like that name.
[School Bell Rings]

31:46.154 --> 31:49.156
How can you even
call yourself a principal?
Okay, this is it!

31:49.241 --> 31:52.660
This is not caring
about the children!
You don't even care about them!

31:57.916 --> 32:00.376
Emma. Emma!
What was that about?

32:00.460 --> 32:03.588
It's just so unfair.
Your kids have worked
so hard for this.

32:03.714 --> 32:08.050
He's already given your choir room
to the mock U.N.
A deal's a deal.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.636
We lost, Emma.
Because Sue cheated!

32:10.721 --> 32:15.600
She cheated! And where do you
think all that money's going?
Right into her pocket!

32:15.684 --> 32:17.602
We can't let her win this one.

32:17.686 --> 32:21.647
How can you be so calm?
How can you give up so easily?

32:21.732 --> 32:24.317
I tried, Emma. Okay?

32:24.443 --> 32:26.444
I-It's over.
No. No.

32:26.528 --> 32:29.739
It's never over.
I don't care what anybody says.
Some things are worth fighting for.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.157
You mean the kids.
Yes, of course.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.908
Anything else?
No.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.202
No, this is about the Glee Club.
This is not about us.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.371
The hell it isn't.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.458
I love you, Emma.
There.

32:40.542 --> 32:46.005
I finally said it.
And you love me. And dentist or no,
this thing isn't over between us.

[Gasps]

32:55.265 --> 32:57.141
Mr. Schuester?
Yeah?

32:57.267 --> 33:00.603
Can you please come
to the auditorium?
Sure.

33:06.526 --> 33:09.278
So, we have something
we need to say to you.

33:11.573 --> 33:15.576
In the beginning of this year
I was just another football player.

33:17.371 --> 33:20.456
- I had a stutter.
- I was the closeted diva.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.291
I used to be captain
of the Cheerios.

33:22.376 --> 33:24.251
I was afraid to dance
outside my room.

33:24.378 --> 33:27.129
I hated everyone
in this club.
So did I.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.465
I wasn't honest
about who I was.

33:29.549 --> 33:32.218
I was tossing kids
into Dumpsters.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.762
I had never
kissed a girl before.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.931
And I was
getting Slusheed.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.851
I didn't—
I didn't have a father-

33:43.355 --> 33:46.273
Someone I could look up to,

33:46.358 --> 33:48.359
model myself after.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.948
Someone who could show me
what it really meant to be a man.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.536
We don't care
what the judges say.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.206
We won...

34:02.290 --> 34:04.625
because we had you
as a teacher.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.962
And Glee Club will never end,
Mr. Schue, because...

34:09.548 --> 34:12.091
you are Glee Club...

in here, Will.

to greener pastures?

37:11.855 --> 37:15.024

to gloat, Sue?
Mostly.

Well, congratulations.

- I should shake your hand.

good enough yet to beat

how the voting went down.

That would betray
my sacred oath
as a judge or something.

The results simply show
the other clubs
to be more deserving.

37:42.344 --> 37:46.055
All I can say is,
casting my vote was easy.

37:46.139 --> 37:50.643

how I felt in my heart
about which team should win.

Well, Sue,
congratulations.

I'm heartless, Will,

38:09.996 --> 38:11.622
and you may have a point.

I spend large segments
of each day picturing you
choking on food.

38:14.459 --> 38:17.586
And I recently contacted
an exotic animal dealer...

38:17.671 --> 38:20.589
'cause I had
a very satisfying dream
that the two of us went to a zoo...

38:20.674 --> 38:24.718
and I shoved your face into
one of those pink, enflamed
monkey butts that weeps lymph.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.721
And I know that you think
I'm a bad person...

38:27.806 --> 38:32.393
because I remain unmoved by
your nattering of trite platitudes
to your ill-shapen students...

38:32.477 --> 38:36.522
about how the human condition
can be improved by,
yes, singing about it.

38:36.606 --> 38:40.025
And I've proven
that I can wipe you
and your Glee Club...

38:40.110 --> 38:43.195
off the face of this earth.

38:43.279 --> 38:46.198
But what kind of a world
would that be, Will?

38:46.282 --> 38:49.868
A world where
I couldn't constantly
ridicule your hair.

38:49.953 --> 38:53.080
A world where I couldn't
make fun of you for tearing up
more than Michael Landon...

38:53.164 --> 38:55.541
in a sweeps week's episode
of Little House on the Prairie.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.460

she wants to live
in that kind of world.

with Figgins.

understand how this sexual
blackmail thing works?

39:11.808 --> 39:15.894
Enough, Sue.
I will not be blackmailed
by you anymore.

39:15.979 --> 39:20.399
I will tell my wife
of our heated sexual congress
before I will be bullied by you again!

39:21.735 --> 39:23.652

the Beast with Two Backs again.
