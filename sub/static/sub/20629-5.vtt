All right.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.400
Oh, great, well,
I broke my hymen in preparation,

11:42.720 --> 11:44.160
so, I'll lie down...

11:46.680 --> 11:48.680
and you...

11:50.320 --> 11:51.840
At my pace, please.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.440
Okay, and now just put it
around my knicker area.

11:57.800 --> 12:03.160
Okay, you may now enter the dome,
with your penis.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.400
Are you enjoying it?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.840
Yeah, but if you keep talking,
it's gonna go down.

12:13.920 --> 12:14.960
Is it tight?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.360
Okay, well, you can say stuff like that.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.760
Is it tight?

12:19.560 --> 12:20.560
Yeah.

12:20.720 --> 12:24.200
Well, let me tell you something,
Mr Ryan, it's all a myth,

12:24.480 --> 12:27.360
virgin tightness has been
scientifically debunked.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.600
Intercourse does not stretch the vagina.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.360
Well, it does, but it just shrinks it down

12:32.440 --> 12:35.040
to what it was before, so,
that means if we do this again

12:35.120 --> 12:38.240
we'll be having the exact same experience
that we're having right now.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.360

12:42.800 --> 12:44.000

12:47.960 --> 12:51.920

Don't worry!

13:03.480 --> 13:05.720
[Marlon] Where did she put
all the fucking snacks?

13:06.800 --> 13:10.000
Right, well,
I guess I've just gotta be honest.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.080
I've never been round a man your age, so,

13:12.160 --> 13:14.200
I don't what the pull is,
but there's a pull and--

13:14.280 --> 13:18.920
Oh, God, I'm getting nervous now.
Yes, I totally fancy you.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.040
I don't know how you feel
you don't have to say--

13:21.160 --> 13:22.680
No, actually, how do you feel?

13:23.240 --> 13:25.240
-How do I feel?
-How do you feel?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I'm hungry.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.640
Me too-- [gasps] Oh, hungry, literally.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.800
My feelings are so intense.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.840
Right, Aaron, so, this is serious, is it?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.360
Yeah, I love her.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.800
Where you from, Candice?
I guess some sorta council block?

13:51.040 --> 13:52.280
What you done with your savings?

13:52.360 --> 13:54.120
They're there. Why? What you implying?

13:54.200 --> 13:56.800
Aaron, you got back up funds.
How much? How much?

13:57.560 --> 14:00.920
Are you spiritual?
Do you have a degree, a job, anything?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.560
A hundred? A thousand?
More? More?

14:02.640 --> 14:03.960
[Marlon] ‘Cause my assumption, right,

14:04.040 --> 14:08.400
is that the answer to these questions are:
no, no, and no.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.120
At the end of the day, what are you doing
to increase his points as a man?

14:12.200 --> 14:14.760
He's now very angry and
saying very crazy things.

14:14.840 --> 14:15.680
It's amazing.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.280
Listen, he don't give me shit.
I'm the one that's working.

14:18.360 --> 14:21.120
Even on a superficial level.
Yeah, you got a face,

14:21.240 --> 14:22.960
you're nice and light,
but where's your bum?

14:23.040 --> 14:24.200
That's significant!

14:24.280 --> 14:27.280
Aaron, I told you,
you want a girl to look like she's dying.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.400
Anorexic here,
morbidly obese here, and here.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.600
Okay, well, I'd love to see your wife.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.960
So would I. Slut.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.320
Aaron, aren't you gonna do anything?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.760
Men do things, boys do Buddha chants.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.600
Oh, son, you gotta do some leg work,
look at them chicken legs.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.840
Chicken legs for a chicken.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.400
Aaron, look,
I know it's not gonna happen tonight,

14:49.480 --> 14:50.840
because the atmosphere's a bit tense,

14:50.920 --> 14:52.760
but can you guys do the wrestling thing
again before you go--

14:52.840 --> 14:54.440
Aaron? Aaron!

14:54.520 --> 14:56.320
He knows I'm only playing with him.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.800
Gotta be cruel to be kind to make a man.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.880
-Well, let me know when that man is made.
-[chuckles]

15:03.560 --> 15:07.840
No, in all honesty,
you're probably a lovely girl.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.360
I hope he's taking good care of ya.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
Thanks.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.880
You look a little like her, you know?

-She were an ugly bitch.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.880
Ooh! Do you mind
if I give that a once over?

16:04.960 --> 16:06.240
You're not supposed to
let girls have your--

16:06.320 --> 16:10.600
I need to check for holes,
because I don't want children right now.

16:11.160 --> 16:16.160
Oh, great, tidy, there's nothing there,
shouldn't you have...

16:16.840 --> 16:18.840
Then again, girls don't always squirt,

16:18.960 --> 16:21.880

Good work, Ryan.

-Do you mind if I take a nap?
-Why?

16:27.600 --> 16:30.880
I just came, and also there's something
very exhausting about you.

16:31.640 --> 16:35.120
Okay, I guess, but you have to
stay here in my sister's room.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.200
Why we in your sister's room?

16:37.480 --> 16:41.120
Well, I heard that sex sometimes smell,

16:41.280 --> 16:45.200
and if there's an odour I want my mum
to think it's her sex, not mine.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.120
Anyway, goodnight.

16:48.360 --> 16:49.360
Uh...

16:49.920 --> 16:52.200
Oh, yes,
I read that falling asleep together

16:52.280 --> 16:54.240
can create an emotional
attachment in women

16:54.320 --> 16:58.200
and I have no desire to see you again,
so, I'll sleep in my room.

We were texting each other the whole time,
since the train journey.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.720
Why didn't you tell me?

17:50.880 --> 17:52.880
Because it ruins the fun.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.360
Okay, I can see you
may have found it deceptive.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.840
I can't say I'm offended.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.760
No, it's, "I can't say I'm not offended."

18:00.840 --> 18:02.920
No, I mean to say,
I'm really not offended.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.600

let's go and discuss this in the cottage?

-Mm.

were supposed to be more evolved,

That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

I've been telling Aaron to be from time?

18:38.280 --> 18:40.520
Just so you know,
he made advances towards me as well,

18:40.600 --> 18:41.640
but I rejected him.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.040
You should have said you
were hungry, Candice,

18:43.120 --> 18:44.440
instead of eating my leftovers.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.440

always have to be about you?

break up with him, it's easier.

To be honest, Dad, it's Candice
you should be apologising to.

what's the point in talking about it?

What do you mean, "He's lying"?
He hasn't said owt. What's happened?

20:40.760 --> 20:42.480
