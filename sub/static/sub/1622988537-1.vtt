WEBVTT

00:49.091 --> 00:50.092
Richie?

00:53.428 --> 00:54.805
I knew you'd find me.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.937
Help! No!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.982
Richie!

02:09.670 --> 02:11.673
-Sweetie.
-Sweetie.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.511
-It's okay. It's okay.
-What's going on?

02:15.594 --> 02:17.471
You had that dream again?

02:17.554 --> 02:20.474
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.645
Hey, come here. We got you.
Okay, Scout. We got you.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.899
You wanna talk about it?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.192
No.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.106
I'm worried about her.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.191
Ever since they pulled that van
out of the lake.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.360
Yeah, I know. I know.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.612
It's been almost a year.
I thought she'd be better by now.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.283
She never used to even blink when
something scary happened in New York.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.536
I used to think that maybe
she was, like, a sociopath or something.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.121
I'm serious.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.583
Look, she was younger then.
I think she understood less.

03:27.666 --> 03:31.670
Yeah, or maybe this case
just hit a little too close to home.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.132
Maybe we just let her see things
a kid her age shouldn't see.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.342
Yeah, well, to be fair,
she's the one who keeps looking.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.597
Maybe she just needs
a little more balance in her life.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.892
-To stop being such a workaholic.
-Yeah.

03:46.977 --> 03:51.023
Yeah. Well, good news
is that there is a strong chance,

03:51.106 --> 03:55.694
a very strong chance
that she's not a sociopath.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.778
Okay?

04:01.366 --> 04:03.160
Breakfast.

04:06.205 --> 04:10.167
Did anyone else hear a loud explosion
or see a bright flash of light last night?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.794
-It was around 2:30 a.m.
-Yay, it's Hilde o'clock.

04:12.878 --> 04:17.716
Okay, guys. Who is excited
about school starting today?

04:17.798 --> 04:19.091
-Me.
-You?

04:19.176 --> 04:21.928
-Yeah. I love school. I love school. Hi.
-I love school. I love school.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.016
God, get a room. I almost miss
you two fighting all the time.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.479
Really, Dad? A clambake write-up?

04:30.562 --> 04:34.107
Yeah, well, that cereal you're
refusing to eat doesn't pay for itself.

04:34.191 --> 04:37.110
So please eat the expensive cereal.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.780
-A clambake?
-Yeah.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.115
Work is work, Scout. No, trust me.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.160
We need all the work we can get now that
Pop-Pop's moving in with us for good.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.954
So that's the way it is.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.457
Okay. So, Dad, I was thinking.

04:50.541 --> 04:54.169
Once Pop-Pop gets settled in,
we could maybe go back to Portland

04:54.253 --> 04:57.047
and try to figure out
who paid the kidnapper.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.465
Maybe we missed something.

04:58.549 --> 05:02.219
Look, Hilde, we spent eight months
looking for our angles,

05:02.302 --> 05:04.680
and every lead that we had came up dry.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.306
Sweetie, you did an amazing thing.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.685
You found a piece of evidence
that helped Sam get out of jail.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.270
You should be very proud of that.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.313
Yeah, so proud. And your mom and I,

05:13.397 --> 05:16.316
-we've come up with an executive decision.
-Yes.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.611
The Richie Fife case is officially closed.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.238
-Thank God.
-What?

05:21.864 --> 05:24.157
All right, look.
I know how much this means to you.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.869
Of course I do.
Look, it means a lot to me too.

05:26.952 --> 05:30.289
But look,
your story had national attention, right?

05:30.372 --> 05:32.875
Anyone with a TV or Internet connection,

05:32.958 --> 05:34.543
they would've read it by now,
including Richie.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.838
-But, Dad, he might still be out there.
-Yeah, well, think about it.

05:37.921 --> 05:42.342
If Richie is still alive,
then he would've read about what happened.

05:42.426 --> 05:45.304
And if he hasn't come home by now,
there's probably a good reason for that.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.182
-What do you mean?
-Sayin' maybe he doesn't wanna be found.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.310
Maybe he's happy.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.188
Yeah, or maybe your whole theory's wrong
and he's D-E-A-D.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.441
-Iz.
-Does that mean the fish ate his B-O-D-Y?

05:57.524 --> 05:58.901
Yeah, okay, look.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.070
Either way,
you have to start covering new stories.

06:02.654 --> 06:06.992
Really, you need to take a break from
this, start doing some normal kid stuff.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.076
You understand?

06:08.744 --> 06:09.953
All right, listen up.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.832
This change in our living situation,
it's gonna affect everyone here,

06:13.916 --> 06:17.419
so does anyone have any questions,
concerns about Pop-Pop moving in?

06:17.503 --> 06:19.004
-Izzy, come on. Talk to me.
-I'm good.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.214
How do you feel about all this?

06:20.297 --> 06:22.633
Ginny, do you have any questions, sweetie?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.259
Is Pop-Pop gonna be okay?

06:29.306 --> 06:34.061
You need to take a break from this.
You need to start sleeping again.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.270
Understand?

07:00.546 --> 07:02.965
Whistler was, like, really boring.

07:03.048 --> 07:06.885
I keep telling my dad we need to go
somewhere warm for the winter. Like, duh.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.304
I'm so glad
we did Mexico instead this year.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.389
Hey, Izzy.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.809
Where'd you go for break?

07:13.892 --> 07:16.186
Another photoshopped trip to Paris?

07:17.855 --> 07:19.106
No. We just stayed here.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.944
'Cause my grandpa's sick.
So we couldn't go anywhere this time.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.072
But we go to cool places, so…

07:55.350 --> 07:57.644
We better get 200 subscribers today.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.524
Hi, have you subscribed to
The Magic Hour Chronicle?

08:02.608 --> 08:04.610
There's a student discount on the back.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.448
Hi, have you subscribed to
The Magic Hour Chronicle?

08:09.531 --> 08:11.116
There's a student discount on the back.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.118
"Vigilantes for truth"?

08:13.702 --> 08:16.330
She thinks she's such a big deal
just because some article she wrote

08:16.413 --> 08:17.956
got picked up by The New York Times.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.627
Actually, it was syndicated
by several national papers.

08:22.461 --> 08:25.464
Okay. No one reads newspapers anyways.

08:25.547 --> 08:29.510
Well, I think you'll be happy to know
that the war on the press

08:29.593 --> 08:33.429
led to a rise in popularity
of investigative journalism.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.640
Right, guys?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.020
On your way to class?

08:41.647 --> 08:42.940
Yes, ma'am.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.276
Have you subscribed
to The Magic Hour Chronicle--

08:46.360 --> 08:47.778
Go.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.034
Promise to be nice and quiet
for Mommy while she gets some work done?

08:54.117 --> 08:56.787
It's one of your last days at the office
before school starts,

08:56.870 --> 08:59.248
so you gotta work really hard
on your artwork, okay?

08:59.831 --> 09:01.708
Hey. Excuse me. Hi.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.252
-Hi.
-Excuse me.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.672
Hey, do you mind signing the petition
to have Principal Kim Collins removed?

09:08.298 --> 09:11.718
"For harboring a criminal and
endangering the lives of our children."

09:12.302 --> 09:14.096
I hope you people are joking.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.724
That's a hard pass for me. Thanks.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.936
Liskos.

09:22.271 --> 09:25.566
Look, I respect your constitutional right
to gather signatures,

09:25.649 --> 09:29.236
but do you know if that right
extends to my place of business?

09:30.487 --> 09:32.364
Yeah, I didn't think so.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.658
Have a good day. Come on, sweetie.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.374
She thinks she's such a big deal
just because some article she wrote

09:42.457 --> 09:44.042
got picked up by The New York Times.

09:48.630 --> 09:52.342
Welcome to HQ.
This is where we work on our stories.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.136
Pretty cool, right?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.973
You cover enough stories,
you stop believing in magic.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.643
-What do you mean?
-Nothing, sweetie.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.729
It's a great hideout.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.397
Hey, Hilde. What's up?

10:07.232 --> 10:10.444
My parents think I'm gonna
let go of the Richie Fife case.

10:10.527 --> 10:14.740
But I think something happened
in this town, and that's why he got taken.

10:16.950 --> 10:21.288
So we're gonna follow every story,
every lead, until one day we're gonna--

10:21.371 --> 10:23.874
-Finally gonna give up?
-No.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.876
It's gonna lead us back to him.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.509
Oh, no.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.178
This is not good.

10:36.887 --> 10:40.474
It's been raining so much.
It must've flooded.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.025
-Hilde.
-Come on.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.944
Let's get this stuff out of here.

11:05.666 --> 11:09.545
Okay. First things first.
I wanna see if there are any other reports

11:09.628 --> 11:12.422
on loud booms or flashes of light
around town last night.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.967
You mean lightning and thunder?
Case closed.

11:15.050 --> 11:19.471
No, it was different from
lightning and thunder. It was bigger.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.683
Well, it's been Erie Harbor's
wettest season on record.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.643
It's not gonna let up anytime soon.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.395
With climate change,

11:26.478 --> 11:28.605
there's gonna be a lot more superstorms
where there shouldn't be.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.941
No, guys. It was different.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.902
It woke me up. It was really loud.

11:33.986 --> 11:37.364
It was like some-- It was like
some big explosion or something.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.409
-We should call Water and Power.
-Good idea.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.411
I'll go talk to Trip.

11:46.665 --> 11:51.253
It's unusual for a pressure system
moving that far north of the Atlantic.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.714
-Hey, Mr. Morton.
-Hey, Hilde.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.696
Got enough right there. You gotta…

12:22.534 --> 12:25.245
No coffee for you, ma'am.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.206
-Hey, Trip.
-Hey.

12:27.289 --> 12:30.292
I mean Sheriff Johnson, sir. I mean ma'am.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.377
I need your help.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.547
Why is everybody staring at me like that?

12:35.631 --> 12:37.341
Can you blame 'em?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.593
I mean, look what you did
to Sheriff Briggs.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.094
Savage.

12:41.845 --> 12:45.057
Besides, there's a new guy in the office
and everyone's on edge.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.350
Who is he?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.935
Look, you should come back later because--

12:50.979 --> 12:53.106
-Sheriff Johnson.
-Yeah?

12:53.190 --> 12:55.943
-May I have a word with you?
-Sure.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.361
Who do you belong to?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.821
I'm Hilde Lisko. I'm a reporter.

13:00.656 --> 13:03.033
Look, I just need to know
if there were any other reports

13:03.116 --> 13:05.702
on a loud boom or a bright flash of light
around 2:00 a.m.?

13:05.786 --> 13:10.082
Sheriff Johnson, please tell me you're
not leaking information to this…

13:12.251 --> 13:14.795
-small person?
-Sir, I'm a member of the press,

13:14.878 --> 13:17.047
-and we have a right--
-Of course not.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.299
We were just gonna call her parents
to come and get her.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.384
Great.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.930
It was nice to meet you, Mister…

13:25.806 --> 13:27.224
It's Rutherford.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.934
-First name?
-Yeah, no.

13:29.017 --> 13:32.312
No, you don't have a first name,
or no, you don't want to give it to me?

13:32.396 --> 13:33.397
Hilde.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.523
Let's go.

13:42.406 --> 13:43.490
Who is that guy?

13:43.574 --> 13:45.826
You can't keep coming in here, Hilde.

13:46.827 --> 13:51.164
I'm sheriff now, and I got a whole new set
of things I gotta deal with.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.583
Like what?

13:52.666 --> 13:56.044
Well, for one, there's a lot of egos
going on out there.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.796
Is that guy your boss?

13:57.880 --> 14:01.133
The state attorney general sent him in
after what happened with Sam's case.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.427
He's here to write a report for the AG.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.220
-And then what?
-Ma'am.

14:08.599 --> 14:10.726
Then he gets to decide
who keeps their job.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.313
So, yeah. In a way, he's my boss.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.107
First time I get any real power,

14:17.191 --> 14:20.319
and they hired a guy who looks like
the other guy to come in above me.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.029
You don't need a boss.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.655
You are the boss.

14:24.615 --> 14:25.616
Okay, then.

14:25.699 --> 14:29.161
So could you just tell me if you have
anything on a strange event last night?

14:30.162 --> 14:31.914
I don't have to come to the station.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.373
We can meet up in secret,

14:33.457 --> 14:35.375
-just like All the President's Men.
-Look.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.920
Now, you know how I feel about you.

14:38.879 --> 14:42.007
I am so proud of everything
that you're doing.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.260
But I can't be your source anymore.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.809
Hilde! Look, I'm sorry.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.146
Really? So you gonna make me
chase you out here?

14:56.230 --> 14:58.565
Hilde. Hilde!

14:58.649 --> 15:00.984
Come on. You know how it is.

15:01.068 --> 15:04.446
In this town, you and I,
now we may be the first,

15:04.530 --> 15:06.740
but we have to make sure
we are not the last.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.620
We are held to a different standard.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.289
Exactly. Which is why we can't back down.

15:14.373 --> 15:18.418
It's a tough time right now.
Rutherford is watching my every move.

15:18.502 --> 15:21.547
If I stopped reporting
every time someone scared me,

15:21.630 --> 15:23.549
I would never get a story.

15:23.632 --> 15:27.761
I just-- I got what I wanted. You know,
for people to start taking me seriously.

15:27.845 --> 15:31.139
And now it's even harder
because no one will talk to me.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.976
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah. I do.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.937
I'm sorry.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.733
The explosion was a transformer
at my dad's farm, okay?

15:42.401 --> 15:45.279
-Was it an accident?
-He doesn't think so. But, Hilde,

15:45.362 --> 15:49.449
there's bigger stuff going on here
besides you and me and our relationship.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.660
If I get caught feeding you information,

15:51.743 --> 15:55.205
I'm out of a job,
and nothing we did here means anything.

15:55.289 --> 15:58.125
Everything just goes back
to the way it was.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.627
But I can help you and your dad, and I--

16:00.711 --> 16:04.256
Look, no. Hilde, I cannot be your source.

16:05.007 --> 16:09.970
I need to focus on doing this job right
and obviously keeping it.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.015
Sorry.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.752
Hi, Mr. Johnson. I'm Hilde Lisko.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.381
I know who you are.
My daughter talks about you plenty.

16:46.465 --> 16:49.051
Besides, I know your grandfather.

16:49.134 --> 16:52.137
Mind if I take a few pictures
for The Magic Hour Chronicle?

16:53.305 --> 16:54.806
Go right ahead.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.653
So you think it got struck by lightning?

17:09.112 --> 17:11.949
Well, that's what they want you to think.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.202
-"They" who?
-The guys over at Wott Management.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.997
Been trying
to buy my land for the last few months,

17:19.080 --> 17:20.915
but I told 'em I'm not gonna sell.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.291
Not in this lifetime.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.128
Turned 'em down again last week.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.007
Then all of a sudden,
they stopped calling.

17:34.429 --> 17:38.267
Next thing I know,
they're flying helicopters low,

17:39.017 --> 17:41.979
scaring my animals,
trying to intimidate me.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.690
I even found some dead cows
over in one of my fields.

17:44.773 --> 17:45.983
Now this.

17:49.361 --> 17:53.156
They can't do that.
Force you to sell your own land.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.408
Yeah, you'd think so.

17:54.491 --> 17:57.661
But now they got some fancy legal BS
they're trying to pull on me.

17:58.328 --> 18:00.539
Don't suppose you know a good lawyer.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.426
Okay.
So, if you have any questions, call me.

18:12.509 --> 18:15.262
I will have your paperwork ready
for you to sign by the end of the week.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.472
Okay? Have a good day.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.933
-Hi. How are you?
-Hey. Hi.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.852
I'm good. Good to see you.

18:21.935 --> 18:22.936
-Hi, Junior.
-Hi.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.564
Hilde gave me a little bit of
background on your case,

18:25.647 --> 18:29.443
which I guess sounds ridiculous
since she's a child.

18:29.526 --> 18:30.527
Oh, no.

18:30.611 --> 18:33.655
I know all about little girls who come
into this world way beyond their years.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.575
Well, have a seat.

18:36.658 --> 18:37.701
-Come here.
-Thank you.

18:37.784 --> 18:38.869
Thank you.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.288
Okay.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.834
You know, my family owned
a dairy farm outside of town for,

18:45.918 --> 18:48.170
what is it, going on 50 years,
right, Daddy?

18:48.253 --> 18:50.297
-53 to be exact.
-Wow.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.341
And I don't do much farming
out there anymore,

18:52.424 --> 18:54.801
but I use the barn
for a glorified animal rescue.

18:55.344 --> 18:56.887
A couple months ago,

18:56.970 --> 19:01.975
this company, Wott Management,
tried to buy it.

19:02.768 --> 19:05.354
Must wanna build a new subdivision
or something.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.814
An offer is always flattering, but--

19:08.440 --> 19:11.902
Holy-- Oh, my God. That is a lot of money.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.656
Especially for this area.
That's gotta be way above market.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.992
-So, what's the issue?
-Me.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.702
I don't wanna sell. Ever.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.913
With all due respect,
with the money they're offering,

19:22.996 --> 19:25.290
you could easily buy another farm
and have plenty left over.

19:25.374 --> 19:26.959
Well…

19:27.042 --> 19:28.794
It's not about the money.

19:28.877 --> 19:32.381
See, back when my old man bought
this place,

19:32.464 --> 19:35.843
it was something for a Black man
to have that kind of land. You know?

19:35.926 --> 19:38.011
-Yeah.
-And I was born and raised there.

19:38.095 --> 19:40.222
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you grew up here.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.932
No, I didn't, technically.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.643
My grandfather passed away
when I was in high school,

19:44.726 --> 19:47.896
so Dad moved us here
and took over the farm.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.315
We have a lot of memories there.

19:50.941 --> 19:53.861
It's like that land is our family.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.363
They're not gonna be happy,

19:56.446 --> 19:58.657
but I could draft a letter
to reject their offer.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.200
We already did that.

20:00.284 --> 20:02.661
And now they're threatening
eminent domain.

20:02.744 --> 20:03.996
Eminent domain?

20:05.414 --> 20:07.207
Are they a government contractor?

20:07.875 --> 20:08.876
Must be.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.421
Do you know anything else
about Wott Management?

20:12.504 --> 20:13.630
Never heard of 'em.

20:13.714 --> 20:15.757
Couldn't find hardly anything
on the Internet.

20:15.841 --> 20:19.553
But wait, does eminent domain really mean
that they can just pay us a pittance

20:19.636 --> 20:21.305
and throw us off our own land?

20:21.388 --> 20:22.723
Unfortunately, it's possible.

20:24.141 --> 20:27.477
But you and I,
we're not gonna let that happen.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.698
-Girls, they're here. Let's go.
-Oh, my gosh.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.116
Pop-Pop!

20:43.160 --> 20:45.829
Yeah, okay. Take it easy.
Take it easy, please.

20:45.913 --> 20:47.080
Thank you.

20:47.748 --> 20:50.626
-Welcome home, Pop-Pop.
-And who have we got here?

20:50.709 --> 20:52.252
Mommy?

20:52.794 --> 20:54.129
Come here, whoever you are.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.548
Let's show Grandpa his new room.

20:56.632 --> 20:59.551
Three, two, one.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.182
What do you think, Pop?

21:11.271 --> 21:12.981
That can't be there.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.399
-What?
-No, no.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.193
You'll love it. I tried it out actually.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.237
-It's super comfy.
-No.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.571
It doesn't belong there.

21:24.952 --> 21:27.204
Oh, no, no. I gotta move this bed.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.873
-Dad, come on. What are you doing?
-It shouldn't be here.

21:29.957 --> 21:32.209
Let me do it. Stop. Come on. Stop it.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.253
Maybe he wants his old room back.

21:34.336 --> 21:37.673
Or he could take Ginny's room,
and she could sleep with me?

21:37.756 --> 21:40.592
That's really nice, sweetie,
but you know what?

21:40.676 --> 21:43.929
Pop-Pop can't make it up the stairs.
It's not safe for him.

21:44.012 --> 21:47.182
-Hey, why don't you go play that record?
-Really?

21:47.266 --> 21:48.350
You wanna sit down?

21:49.810 --> 21:50.936
All right.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.271
That's it.

21:52.896 --> 21:53.897
All right?

21:54.606 --> 21:56.400
-Can I get you anything?
-No.

21:57.109 --> 21:59.069
-Okay.
-You wanna dance, Pop-Pop?

22:04.908 --> 22:07.744
There you go. There you go.

22:08.996 --> 22:10.122
All right.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.490
-Is everything okay, Scout?
-Yeah.

22:47.993 --> 22:51.747
It's just that I've been thinking about
what you said.

22:51.830 --> 22:54.124
That maybe Richie doesn't wanna come back.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.127
Oh, Hilde. Please, come on.

22:57.211 --> 22:59.379
-Please.
-But what if that's not it?

23:01.048 --> 23:02.049
What if…

23:04.676 --> 23:06.303
What if he's already here?

23:07.638 --> 23:09.389
What are you talking about?

23:11.308 --> 23:15.812
Do you ever feel like
somebody's just watching you?

23:15.896 --> 23:18.482
I just mean, like a feeling.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.068
No.

23:25.197 --> 23:26.198
Okay.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.785
Yeah, what are you working on, anyway?

23:33.497 --> 23:38.335
"How to be a kid."

23:42.256 --> 23:43.340
What about you?

23:44.925 --> 23:48.178
Just another crab story.

23:49.847 --> 23:51.473
I thought it was clams.

23:53.809 --> 23:58.063
Yeah, clams. That's what I said.

23:58.772 --> 24:00.190
Yeah, right.

24:15.622 --> 24:16.623
Excuse us.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.836
Hi. Who are you guys?

24:20.919 --> 24:23.881
I'm Hilde Lisko.
This is Donny, and this is Spoon.

24:23.964 --> 24:26.967
We kinda got our old librarian fired
for helping a kidnapper,

24:27.050 --> 24:29.761
but we hope to
get off on a better foot with you.

24:31.889 --> 24:34.474
Unless you've been convicted of a felony,

24:34.558 --> 24:38.937
in which case,
you should probably consider quitting.

24:39.813 --> 24:42.107
Well, I really like your paper.

24:42.691 --> 24:44.526
-You do?
-Yep.

24:45.402 --> 24:49.656
I studied library sciences in college,
so… pretty weird.

24:51.158 --> 24:52.242
Cool.

24:55.162 --> 24:56.288
So what can I do for you?

24:56.371 --> 24:59.166
I'm looking into a company
called Wott Management.

24:59.708 --> 25:01.251
I couldn't find anything online.

25:02.753 --> 25:03.837
Strange.

25:04.796 --> 25:05.797
Let's split up.

25:13.764 --> 25:17.017
Junior thinks these Wott people
are trying to scare him off his land.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.020
He says they blew up his transformer.

25:22.523 --> 25:24.483
He thinks they killed
some of his animals too.

25:26.944 --> 25:30.155
But who's Wott Management?
And why do they want his land?

25:31.990 --> 25:35.202
They're trying to use
eminent domain to kick him off his land.

25:36.078 --> 25:37.955
Why would they want it?

25:38.705 --> 25:40.874
Well, what else is around there?

25:40.958 --> 25:43.502
Right next door is this fancy mansion.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.004
It's called
the Catherine Woodruff Mansion.

25:46.088 --> 25:48.674
I wonder if
they're trying to buy that place too.

25:50.884 --> 25:53.428
Hilde. What are you doing?

25:53.512 --> 25:55.389
Shouldn't you be in class right now?

25:58.851 --> 26:02.396
You are so smart, and so driven.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.065
-But your grades really--
-Suck?

26:05.148 --> 26:08.235
Technically,
I am not supposed to say it like that,

26:08.318 --> 26:10.112
but I talked to your parents.

26:10.195 --> 26:12.990
Last semester,
you missed several days of school,

26:13.073 --> 26:14.575
and your grades really suffered.

26:15.284 --> 26:19.288
I know. And I promise I'll try really hard
not to let it happen again.

26:19.872 --> 26:22.082
That's an interesting choice of words.

26:22.165 --> 26:25.419
"I promise I'll try"
and not "I promise I will."

26:26.086 --> 26:29.673
And since you are a writer,
I am going to assume that was intentional.

26:30.382 --> 26:32.843
So, I'll be watching you.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.761
Yes, Principal Collins.

26:39.391 --> 26:40.684
Are you okay?

26:41.977 --> 26:45.147
You know,
after all the holidays and stuff,

26:45.230 --> 26:50.777
my dad says that people that have
loved ones in prison need extra support.

26:53.447 --> 26:54.448
Go back to class.

27:19.181 --> 27:20.390
What are you doing?

27:21.975 --> 27:22.976
Studying.

27:25.646 --> 27:26.939
No, you're not.

27:30.651 --> 27:31.860
Just put my books away.

27:33.487 --> 27:36.907
Why would you put your books away
if you're not finished with your lunch?

27:36.990 --> 27:39.660
God, okay, Benedict Cumberbatch, I get it.
I'm lying.

27:44.206 --> 27:46.416
-Are you hiding from someone?
-No.

27:48.752 --> 27:49.753
Just…

27:54.091 --> 27:57.052
I don't know. It just feels weird
being here without Ethan, you know?

27:57.135 --> 27:59.096
Not really.

28:00.848 --> 28:01.849
I mean, like…

28:03.934 --> 28:06.979
I didn't really realize how many friends
I don't have until I got here.

28:11.108 --> 28:13.026
Jessica Fife is trolling me.

28:13.110 --> 28:15.696
Like, she keeps DMing me,
but I just keep ignoring her.

28:16.488 --> 28:17.906
How's that trolling?

28:18.657 --> 28:21.577
Because I've spoken to her
approximately twice.

28:21.660 --> 28:24.204
And the second time ended
with me punching her in the face.

28:26.415 --> 28:28.500
Maybe she wants
to be friends with you now.

28:28.584 --> 28:30.460
God, Hilde, look.

28:30.544 --> 28:33.922
I know you're like this, like,
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist,

28:34.631 --> 28:36.341
but you literally suck at human people.

28:36.967 --> 28:39.928
No, I do not think
she wants to be friends.

28:40.012 --> 28:41.013
Well…

28:42.806 --> 28:46.476
I may not know people, but I know you.

28:48.020 --> 28:50.063
And in my opinion,

28:50.147 --> 28:53.942
you're the best, coolest,

28:55.611 --> 28:58.238
smartest sister in the whole wide world.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.618
And anybody would be lucky
to be friends with you.

29:04.286 --> 29:07.080
You know what I do
when I get scared or nervous?

29:08.332 --> 29:10.959
I put my head down and I work.

29:11.919 --> 29:16.924
It always makes me feel better to know
that no matter what, I'm a journalist.

29:19.510 --> 29:23.013
No one gave that to me,
so no one can take it away.

29:25.557 --> 29:27.351
And you don't have no friends.

29:28.810 --> 29:29.811
You have me.

29:32.105 --> 29:33.106
Thanks.

30:27.911 --> 30:31.123
-God, that was like a horror movie.
-Why do you keep blocking me?

30:32.040 --> 30:34.168
Well, why you trying to follow me?

30:34.251 --> 30:38.046
I was trying to invite you to my sweet 16,
but now I have to do it in person

30:38.130 --> 30:40.424
with a paper invitation
like it's the '90s or something.

30:43.343 --> 30:45.053
Yeah, I know, super gross.

30:45.137 --> 30:48.182
My mom made me get them so she could,
like, scrapbook them or whatever.

30:49.892 --> 30:53.312
You want me to come to
your birthday party? Why?

30:53.395 --> 30:55.981
I guess your family
did a lot for my family, or whatever.

30:57.816 --> 31:00.152
But thank you.

31:01.695 --> 31:02.696
Thanks.

31:02.779 --> 31:06.200
You know, I don't think I've ever actually
talked to you for this long before.

31:07.618 --> 31:10.454
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
When you first came here,

31:10.537 --> 31:13.373
I thought you were gonna come in and
try to, like, take over the entire school.

31:13.457 --> 31:15.959
-Wait, are you kidding? Me?
-I don't know.

31:17.294 --> 31:20.339
I honestly thought maybe you thought
you were better than us or something,

31:20.422 --> 31:21.924
just because you're from Brooklyn.

31:22.841 --> 31:24.676
And I have always wanted
to go to New York.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.386
Well, yeah, it's the best.

31:28.639 --> 31:30.766
Okay, look, if I come to your birthday,

31:30.849 --> 31:34.686
you're not gonna, like, pour a bucket
of pig's blood on me, are you?

31:35.562 --> 31:37.356
I have no idea what you're talking about.

31:38.398 --> 31:40.734
It's from a movie. Carrie?

31:40.817 --> 31:43.987
Whatever. Besides, I'm a vegetarian.

31:48.659 --> 31:49.910
I'll see you later?

31:49.993 --> 31:50.994
Yeah.

32:02.005 --> 32:04.424
Why do you even
wanna go to this thing anyways?

32:06.093 --> 32:08.428
Did you know that sweet 16s were invented

32:08.512 --> 32:11.515
so girls could dress up
and find rich husbands?

32:12.140 --> 32:15.435
There are so many things wrong with that.
I don't even know where to start.

32:15.519 --> 32:17.479
-Great, then don't.
-What?

32:17.563 --> 32:18.564
Start.

32:21.233 --> 32:22.901
What about this one?

32:23.569 --> 32:27.906
No. I need something that, like, an
annoying Instagram influencer would post

32:27.990 --> 32:30.534
in, like, a flower crown filter
or something.

32:31.743 --> 32:33.120
The theme is Coachella.

32:34.538 --> 32:35.539
You know?

32:35.622 --> 32:39.418
It's basically like a veiled excuse
for underage drinking and drug use

32:39.501 --> 32:42.546
in a place where it'd take a very
long time to get competent medical care.

32:42.629 --> 32:45.924
See?
I told you Jessica wanted to be friends.

32:46.717 --> 32:49.136
Yeah, I don't know. It still feels weird.

32:49.219 --> 32:50.596
Where is this thing, anyway?

32:51.263 --> 32:52.764
Some fancy house, I guess.

32:53.682 --> 32:55.350
The Catherine Woodruff Mansion.

32:56.101 --> 32:57.227
Catherine Woodruff?

32:57.311 --> 32:59.730
You mean the mansion
right next to Trip's dad's farm?

32:59.813 --> 33:02.482
Yeah, okay. I'm gonna take that
as a personal point of pride

33:02.566 --> 33:05.027
that I have no idea
what you're talking about right now.

33:05.110 --> 33:08.530
Could you text Donny? "I have a plan…"

33:08.614 --> 33:09.656
No.

33:15.204 --> 33:16.288
Here.

33:16.371 --> 33:17.623
Thank you.

33:19.583 --> 33:20.792
So what are we doing?

33:21.710 --> 33:24.880
We're gonna crash a party to see if
the Woodruff Mansion has anything to do

33:24.963 --> 33:26.715
with what's been going on
at Junior's farm.

33:26.798 --> 33:29.635
Party? Let's do this.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.849
Find anything on Wott Management?

33:37.726 --> 33:40.145
Hi. How are you?

33:40.229 --> 33:42.356
You got, I don't know, schoolwork…

33:42.439 --> 33:44.233
-School. I think there was school.
-…or homework…

33:44.316 --> 33:46.068
or anything that kids-- normal kids do?

33:46.151 --> 33:50.531
Actually, I'm going out later
with Donny and Spoon to a par--

33:51.198 --> 33:52.658
Where are you going later?

33:53.242 --> 33:54.743
Nowhere.

33:55.577 --> 33:57.996
To Donny's. To Spoon's.

33:59.122 --> 34:00.374
There will be adults there.

34:01.375 --> 34:02.376
Adults.

34:03.043 --> 34:07.047
God, you are such a bad liar.
What are you up to?

34:08.297 --> 34:10.551
All right, Iz. Let's see what you got.

34:12.594 --> 34:14.763
Oh, honey.

34:14.847 --> 34:16.764
-Wow.
-Did you try it on?

34:17.306 --> 34:18.600
Yeah.

34:18.684 --> 34:22.103
Yeah, I know it's, like, kinda weird,
and it definitely doesn't fit,

34:22.187 --> 34:23.897
and the fabric's, like, totally gross.

34:23.981 --> 34:27.275
But I don't know,
there's just, like, something about it.

34:27.943 --> 34:29.652
-Matt.
-Dad, shut up.

34:29.735 --> 34:30.862
-I like it.
-Stop.

34:30.946 --> 34:33.532
-God, did I make a horrible mistake?
-No, you did not.

34:33.614 --> 34:36.076
You know what? Let's Pretty in Pink it.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.661
What's Pretty in Pink?

34:40.956 --> 34:42.541
What's Pretty in Pink?

34:50.882 --> 34:53.719
You pick. Pink or green?

34:54.303 --> 34:56.054
-Pink. We gotta do pink, right?
-Pink.

35:06.148 --> 35:11.236
Okay, okay.
So this is a pretty big older kid party.

35:12.112 --> 35:15.073
So I don't want you drinking anything
you didn't pour for yourself.

35:15.157 --> 35:16.533
You know what, scrap that.

35:16.617 --> 35:19.578
I don't want you drinking anything
at all, all right?

35:19.661 --> 35:22.122
Remain dehydrated at all times.

35:22.206 --> 35:23.832
I'm serious, no liquids.

35:24.666 --> 35:27.044
-Deal?
-Yes, deal.

35:27.127 --> 35:28.962
-Okay.
-Geez, Dad. You okay?

35:29.046 --> 35:30.589
You seem more nervous than I am.

35:30.672 --> 35:33.467
Look, just call me, please.
All right? You call me.

35:33.550 --> 35:36.094
You call me if anything happens.
You need a ride home, you call me.

35:36.178 --> 35:37.763
Just call me, all right?

35:37.846 --> 35:40.516
-No questions asked, just call me.
-Okay. Okay.

35:40.599 --> 35:42.476
Dad, we used to live in Brooklyn.

35:42.559 --> 35:45.395
Okay, you let me ride the bus
by myself when I was, like, 13.

35:45.479 --> 35:47.940
Yeah, yeah.
And I've been regretting it ever since.

35:48.023 --> 35:51.360
-So what is your point?
-I'll be fine, Dad.

35:52.319 --> 35:54.905
Will you just please
drop me off over there instead?

35:54.988 --> 35:57.324
-Have fun, honey!
-Oh, my God.

35:57.991 --> 35:59.409
Oh, my God.

35:59.493 --> 36:02.037
Dad, has she really been on speakerphone
the entire time?

36:02.120 --> 36:03.747
Make good choices!

36:03.830 --> 36:07.000
Oh, my God. Dad! Why?

36:09.336 --> 36:12.548
-Bye.
-I love you, Iz!

36:13.173 --> 36:16.176
We love you! You look amazing.

36:16.260 --> 36:18.971
Yeah, and I will kill anyone
who even looks at you, all right?

36:19.054 --> 36:20.639
-Stop.
-No, sorry.

36:20.722 --> 36:22.766
I mean, I will teach you to kill them!

36:22.850 --> 36:25.435
'Cause you are a strong
and powerful woman!

36:25.519 --> 36:26.520
Yes!

36:27.646 --> 36:30.065
Yes. Oh, my God.
What is happening right now?

37:02.389 --> 37:05.017
I thought you said
we weren't wearing costumes.

37:05.601 --> 37:08.228
This isn't a costume.
It's a conversation piece.

37:15.944 --> 37:18.947
-Hey, Izzy, you came.
-Oh, my God, Jessica.

37:19.031 --> 37:20.908
I'm so sorry.
I didn't even know they were coming.

37:20.991 --> 37:23.535
I shouldn't even have told her about it
in the first place.

37:24.411 --> 37:26.496
This is it. This is my pig's blood.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.957
No, don't worry about it.
It's not a big deal.

37:29.499 --> 37:31.084
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

37:31.168 --> 37:34.421
Everyone here thinks she's, like,
too big for her britches or whatever.

37:35.589 --> 37:37.049
Give me one second.

37:44.097 --> 37:45.474
Uh-oh. Incoming.

37:47.893 --> 37:50.479
Hey, you guys.
Do you mind if we get a photo?

38:01.240 --> 38:04.451
-Got it.
-You guys have fun tonight, okay?

38:07.579 --> 38:09.957
Well, let's go. We've got work to do.

38:17.589 --> 38:18.924
Come on.

38:41.071 --> 38:44.283
No offices or file cabinets anywhere.

38:44.366 --> 38:46.743
We need to find out who owns this house

38:46.827 --> 38:49.162
or why this land is so valuable.

38:50.205 --> 38:52.833
Wait, look. Who's that guy?

38:52.916 --> 38:53.959
I don't know.

38:58.213 --> 38:59.631
Drawers.

39:13.437 --> 39:14.855
Guys, look.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.819
Wait. What do you think is in there?

39:30.370 --> 39:35.375
No! No, thank you.
I am not going down there.

39:35.459 --> 39:37.294
But we have to figure out what's there.

39:37.961 --> 39:39.838
Or we could just leave.

39:39.922 --> 39:43.050
There could be
a whole vault of secret files down there.

39:43.133 --> 39:44.134
Or not.

39:45.302 --> 39:46.887
Fine, I'll go.

39:47.596 --> 39:48.931
Wait, Hilde.

39:49.014 --> 39:50.224
-Here.
-Thank you.

41:13.348 --> 41:16.768
Hello? Someone out there?

41:44.671 --> 41:46.757
Someone doesn't want us down here.

41:48.800 --> 41:52.095
Guys, did you hear that sound? Guys?

41:59.228 --> 42:00.812
Guys, I need your help!

42:03.524 --> 42:05.067
-Hilde!
-Guys!

42:06.276 --> 42:09.780
-No, what? What is happening?
-Go. Come on.

42:09.863 --> 42:11.365
Hilde, what's wrong?

42:12.950 --> 42:14.493
What did you see down there?

42:14.576 --> 42:17.829
I don't think Richie Fife's
the only secret in Erie Harbor.
