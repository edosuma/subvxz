00:45.000 --> 00:48.300
We've got two entry wounds...

00:51.800 --> 00:53.399
...and two exit wounds.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.799
Through-and-throughs.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.099
Any ID on her?

00:56.100 --> 00:57.699
No wallet,
no purse,

00:57.700 --> 00:58.599
no cell.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.600
Brass is tracking down
the lease.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.900
None of the neighbors
seem to know her.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.699
Buildings like these
get a lot of transients.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.400
People who tend to keep
to themselves.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.600
Looks like the drawers have been
rifled through.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.999
Maybe she walked in
on a robbery in progress.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.700
Yeah, except there's no sign
of forced entry.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.099
One, two, three, four,
five, six,

01:25.100 --> 01:27.999
seven casings,
which means

01:28.000 --> 01:30.200
there's seven bullets
to look for.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.600
Got a strange blood drop.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.800
It's pretty far
from the vic.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.599
Could belong
to the suspect.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.400
It's circular.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.200
No directionality.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.100
Suspect would have had to be
standing perfectly still.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.400
It's gravitational.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.200
Greg, could you get
the Hawkeye, please?

02:24.700 --> 02:26.000
Here you go.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.000
Mitch, could you check
the apartment

02:28.000 --> 02:29.700
immediately above this one?

02:29.800 --> 02:31.100
You got it, Doc.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.400
Mack, James,
upstairs.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.100
LVPD. Open up!

03:00.300 --> 03:01.299
<i>Open the door!</i>

03:01.300 --> 03:02.800
<i>Get the ram.</i>

03:07.500 --> 03:10.200
It looks like this crime
has a second story.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.900
Maria Espinosa,

04:09.900 --> 04:11.500
organ donor.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.100
Heart was in the right place.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.399
Unfortunately, her head
was in the wrong place.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.000
No exit wound.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.599
Bullet probably hit bone
and fragmented.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.100
Okay.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.599
So a stray bullet rips

04:22.600 --> 04:24.900
through the floor and
Mrs. Espinosa winds up

04:24.900 --> 04:26.400
collateral damage.

04:28.900 --> 04:29.999
Hey, guys.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.400
I found something.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.800
What do you
got,

04:40.100 --> 04:41.300
Greg?

04:42.400 --> 04:43.900
Urine.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.600
There's no sign
of any pets in here.

05:00.500 --> 05:05.000
Maybe the shooter freaked out
and wet himself.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.000
Not exactly a hardened criminal.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.899
You know, the bullet trajectory

05:57.900 --> 06:01.299
and the location of the
facial wound suggest

06:01.300 --> 06:04.000
that she was in this position
when she was shot.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.199
She was probably trying
to hear

06:05.200 --> 06:07.500
what was going on downstairs.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.100
Shut up!

06:17.600 --> 06:19.499
Guess it doesn't pay
to be a nosy neighbor.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.399
Yeah, but Brass said that the
neighbors heard the gunshots,

06:21.400 --> 06:22.999
but they didn't hear
any raised voices

06:23.000 --> 06:25.100
or arguing.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.300
What was she listening to?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.100
Tramp stamp.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.400
Looks more like a tramp belt.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.600
Help me roll her.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.899
So, hot girl
with dollar-sign tats

06:52.900 --> 06:55.100
and a mostly empty apartment.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.400
Prostitute, right?

06:56.400 --> 06:57.600
Maybe.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.200
Mae she just
loves money.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.399
You know, it's the love of money

07:03.400 --> 07:05.300
that is the root
of all evil.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.099
Most people think

07:07.100 --> 07:08.600
it's just the money.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.400
Oh, sage.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.000
Washroom.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.899
Hey, Catherine,
are you collecting trace

07:16.900 --> 07:17.899
from Blondie's body?

07:17.900 --> 07:19.300
As we speak.

07:19.300 --> 07:23.999
So I've collected seven bullets
and seven shell casings

07:24.000 --> 07:25.799
from the apartment
where she was shot.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.300
So what's the problem?

07:27.300 --> 07:30.200
One of these bullets is supposed
to be in Mrs. Espinosa.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.500
Well, maybe you recovered a
bullet from a different event.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.600
Maybe.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.299
Have you checked Blondie
for GSR?

07:39.300 --> 07:40.900
Hang on... not yet.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.099
Sodium rhodizonate test

07:55.100 --> 07:56.900
on right hand.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.300
Positive for GSR.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.500
She had a gun of her own.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.799
Ballistics confirms
that all these

08:11.800 --> 08:14.699
nine-millimeter casings
were fired in the same weapon,

08:14.700 --> 08:17.099
but Doc Robbins pulled
thisullet fragment

08:17.100 --> 08:19.100
from Mrs. Espinosa.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
It's cannelured.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.700
So...

08:25.800 --> 08:27.299
Blondie had a revolver.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.800
Hence no shell casings.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.000
Okay, so she goes back
to her apartment

08:32.200 --> 08:34.099
<i>packing heat,
and somebody's already there</i>

08:34.100 --> 08:35.700
<i>waiting to light her up.
(two gunshots)</i>

08:38.200 --> 08:40.299
<i>one ot goes
through the ceiling,</i>

08:40.299 --> 08:43.099
accidentally killing
Mrs. Espinosa.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.000
Welcome to the O.K. Corral.

08:47.200 --> 08:47.999
Yeah, Jim?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.900
I just got off the phone
with the apartment manager.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.200
Yeah?
Did you get an ID on Blondie?

08:51.200 --> 08:52.199
It's not her apartment.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.699
The name on the lease
is Kellen Tyford.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.699
Drops?

08:55.700 --> 08:57.000
The nightclub promoter?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.400
Yeah, and get this.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.099
He leases
the upstairs apartment, too.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.299
That's a lot of apartments

09:02.300 --> 09:05.000
for a guy who's getting
free room and board.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.999
Well, well, well.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.200
What's a convict to do?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.300
Check and mate.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.400
Whoo!

09:31.400 --> 09:33.100
He played
right into it.

09:33.300 --> 09:34.399
Oh, man, that was...

09:34.400 --> 09:35.600
Did you see that?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.300
I totally got him.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.999
Looks like something
more than forensics

09:50.000 --> 09:51.799
be jamming a brother
up in here.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.000
Man, y'all some
jinxes, man.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.199
You know,
this is a setup.

09:55.200 --> 09:55.999
Don't you get it?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.899
Ivy League
college student

09:57.900 --> 10:00.599
versus a high school dropout
convict.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.100
You got no chance.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.299
And so said a jury
of your peers.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.400
Look, eight months on a
weak-ass weapons charge?

10:07.400 --> 10:08.300
It's a vacation.

10:08.300 --> 10:09.900
Vacation, huh?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.300
So who's this?

10:11.800 --> 10:13.200
Your house-sitter?

10:13.400 --> 10:16.600
We found her at your apartment
over on Vegas Valley.

10:17.000 --> 10:17.999
What's her name?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.900
Jessica Jaynes.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.700
J.J. everybody calls her.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.700
But what happened to her?

10:23.700 --> 10:24.799
She drowned.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.000
So what was she doing
at your apartment?

10:27.200 --> 10:27.800
Don't know.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.499
You pimping her out, Superfly?

10:29.500 --> 10:31.000
Pimping her out?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.800
Nah, pimping ain't easy,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.999
and you know I'm all
about the easy, okay?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.099
J.J. used to come
to my club.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.499
She was a club rat.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.600
Sometimes she
worked atmosphere.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.399
Oh, atmosphere.
What's that, like turning

10:42.400 --> 10:43.099
into a smoke machine?

10:43.100 --> 10:45.500
No, more like
an ATM machine.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.100
You sit her
on a couch,

10:47.100 --> 10:48.499
tourists start
to buy her drinks,

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
she makes me money.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.399
Yeah, especially when
the tourist leaves with her.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.899
So what's your cut, Easy?

10:53.900 --> 10:57.100
Look, if the customers
like the atmosphere...

10:58.300 --> 11:00.100
...then I try to
Chuck Woolery that.

11:00.100 --> 11:00.800
Okay?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.199
I want my customers happy.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.399
You know any unhappy
customers, Chuck?

11:04.400 --> 11:05.700
Look at her.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.700
She even looks good
in that picture.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.299
Yeah, I admit,
she looks a whole lot better

11:12.300 --> 11:14.800
than Mrs. Espinosa upstairs.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.300
Who did it?

11:19.600 --> 11:21.299
If I knew that,
I wouldn't have driven

11:21.300 --> 11:22.799
all the way out here
to this frying pan

11:22.800 --> 11:24.000
in the desert to ask you.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.200
This woman took care of me
when I was a kid.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Went homeless a couple
of years ago...

11:32.300 --> 11:34.299
...so I moved her into my house.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.999
When the tax dudes took that,

11:36.000 --> 11:37.199
I had to rent the apartments.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.800
Top bunk was hers,
bottom was mine...

11:39.800 --> 11:42.200
Figured it was the least
I can do,

11:42.300 --> 11:45.699
being as she had to wipe
my snot nose all the time.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.200
What was J.J. doing downstairs?

11:48.900 --> 11:49.999
I told you.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.599
I don't know, so unless
you want me to start lying...

11:52.600 --> 11:54.100
You never stop.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.000
If that's the way you feel,

11:56.500 --> 11:57.800
I'm out.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.700
Mr. Jaynes, we'd be happy

12:12.700 --> 12:14.500
to have someone watch
your son while you're

12:14.500 --> 12:15.800
doing this, you know?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.100
He stays with me.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.900
Mr. Jaynes, is that your wife?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.600
Yeah, and his mommy.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.099
Do you have any idea
what your wife

12:31.100 --> 12:33.200
was doing
at the Glanville Apartments?

12:33.500 --> 12:35.000
She has lots of friends.

12:35.900 --> 12:38.800
She always came home
every night... to me.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.300
To our baby.

12:41.700 --> 12:42.700
Sir.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.900
We almost got all the way
around, girl.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.900
Maybe these will
help out a little?

13:09.400 --> 13:12.200
Or would you two
prefer to be alone?

13:12.200 --> 13:13.900
Ah, very funny.

13:14.100 --> 13:17.299
So, Grissom comes up
with a theory,

13:17.300 --> 13:18.500
and we get
to do the reenactments

13:18.500 --> 13:20.099
and the photo docs.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.600
Yeah.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.100
Well, it's...

13:25.400 --> 13:27.100
good to be the king, I suppose.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.400
Sure is.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.000
Perfect.
Mm-hmm.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.000
Oops.
Damn it.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.400
Hey, Nick, hang .

13:42.900 --> 13:43.900
What?

13:57.200 --> 13:58.999
That look like
a bullet hole to you?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.600
Yeah. It sure does.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.800
.38 cannelured revolver round.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.499
I like it
when the king gets it wrong.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.200
Keeps him human.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.399
The bullet we found
in Mrs. Espinosa's ceiling

14:40.400 --> 14:41.699
was fired from the same revolver

14:41.700 --> 14:43.800
as the bullet that went
into her cheek.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.899
Yeah, but there were
two bullets in the apartment.

14:47.900 --> 14:50.100
And only one hole in her floor.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.100
Which means the kill shot

14:52.300 --> 14:54.200
had to be a separate event.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.500
I think we got
the timeline backwards.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.800
<i>Looks to me like
J.J. shot Mrs. Espinosa first.</i>

15:05.100 --> 15:06.800
??

15:07.100 --> 15:09.100
<i>Then went downstairs</i>

15:09.300 --> 15:10.400
??

15:11.200 --> 15:13.900
<i>where
somebody returned the favor.</i>

15:18.300 --> 15:20.500
Yeah. Who's the somebody?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.399
'Cause the only
name on the lease

15:22.400 --> 15:23.900
is Drops,

15:24.200 --> 15:26.499
and he has
a really good alibi.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.099
Yeah and even
if he knew who it was,

15:28.100 --> 15:30.600
he's not going
to just give them up.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.400
He may not have to.

15:32.700 --> 15:33.499
So that urine sample

15:33.500 --> 15:35.000
that Greg found in the
downstairs apartment,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.700
had female epithelials in it.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.100
Now, I ran it through CODIS.

15:38.100 --> 15:38.700
I didn't get any hits,

15:38.700 --> 15:43.100
but the suspect has  half her DNA in common at
every marker with Mrs. Espinosa.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.000
It's her daughter?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.800
Mm-hmm, Dana Espinosa.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.299
Dana's got a record.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.799
She was charged
with attempted murder

15:48.800 --> 15:51.100
for something involving
a Japanese businessman

15:51.100 --> 15:52.699
with his nose full of blow,

15:52.700 --> 15:54.399
skydiving out of the
eighth story of The Palms

15:54.400 --> 15:56.799
without a parachute,
but the point is this:

15:56.800 --> 15:59.700
there was a defense witness
whose testimony exonerated her.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.400
Care to guess who?

16:01.700 --> 16:02.900
Drops.
Drops.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.499
I don't know, Kellen.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.000
I'm having trouble
with this idea

16:06.000 --> 16:07.700
that you're
such a nice guy.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.999
I mean, renting
your apartment

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
<i>to a little, old lady
and her daughter?</i>

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
You're right.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.199
I'm not a nice guy.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.999
But you plant your seed
in a woman,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.400
you got to take care of it.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.900
Dana's pregnant?

16:19.300 --> 16:20.700
Due next month.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.000
That explains the urine at the scene.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.799
No bladder control,
especially in a gunfight.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.199
So make a ho a housewife.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.700
I saw that movie.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.299
Look, man, first of all,
Dana was no ho.

16:30.300 --> 16:33.299
I scooped her out the atmosphere
before she could get touched.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.800
You sure about that?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.700
Why would J.J. kill

16:37.700 --> 16:40.000
Mrs. Espinosa
and then try to kill Dana?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.700
I mean, ey roll
in the same clique.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.700
I can't explain these women.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.800
One minute, they're sending
each other cupcakes on Facebook,

16:47.900 --> 16:49.099
the next, they're
trying to kill each

16:49.100 --> 16:50.900
other over a broken
curling iron.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.400
But I do know...

16:53.800 --> 16:56.200
that if J.J. tried
to creep on Dana,

16:56.300 --> 16:58.000
Dana ain't just
gonna just sit there.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.199
She a bad bitch.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.900
If someone's gunning for her
or she's gunning
for somebody else,

17:01.900 --> 17:03.099
we need to find her.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.599
You ain't gonna get her.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.900
She badder, sneakier,

17:06.900 --> 17:07.699
more dangerous.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.400
I'll warn the SWAT team.

17:09.599 --> 17:10.300
Let's give her a call.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.099
What's her phone number?
Phone call?

17:12.200 --> 17:13.800
Yeah.
From your cop phone number?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.000
Yeah.
No chance.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.300
And she won't answer
an unknown caller either.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.000
I'll text in "sugar daddy."

17:20.500 --> 17:23.200
No, this is the kind of girl
you have to find in person.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.799
Then give us some addresses.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.200
What are you going to do?
MapQuest her ass?

17:27.200 --> 17:28.600
That's not going to work.

17:29.700 --> 17:30.499
There's only one way

17:30.500 --> 17:32.000
to find this girl.

17:32.700 --> 17:33.500
Let me out.

17:35.800 --> 17:36.399
No, for real.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.800
I mean, I can have her
to you today.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.599
You think we can just
pop you out of jail?

17:40.600 --> 17:43.200
<i>Yeah. Like 48 Hours.</i>

17:43.300 --> 17:44.499
You know, the flick.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.000
Nolte busts Eddie out of jail.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.700
They get the bad guy.
Everything's cool.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.400
You think this is a joke, man?

17:50.500 --> 17:52.599
Dead bodies are piling up
around your new family.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.499
Now, that would worry me.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.800
But if you want to angle
for some weekend pass

17:56.800 --> 17:59.300
instead of helping us out,
that's fine, man. I understand.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.700
Let's get out of here.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.400
Hey, we out.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.099
Are these the
text messages

18:13.100 --> 18:14.600
that came from
Jessica Jaynes phone?

18:14.700 --> 18:17.100
Yep. No physical
phone required.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.199
Everything's stored
on the server.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.800
You ever worry that you could be
replaced by a computer?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.500
Every day of my life.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.500
Last text she sent
was to her husband's number,

18:27.500 --> 18:30.000
about a half hour before
the apartment shootings.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.300
"Wit Val she knows where
D stashed our money.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.700
"Yay! Be back
soon wit phat pockets.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.400
Kisses to you and Bebe."

18:38.700 --> 18:40.900
Sounds like this girl
was looking for a big score.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.500
We didn't find any money
in either of those apartments.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.600
Well, maybe that's what got
the old lady killed.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.900
"D" for Dana or Drops?

18:51.100 --> 18:52.400
Pull up her voice calls.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.600
Yep.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.999
Okay, the last call she got was

18:58.000 --> 18:59.900
from Valinda Carlisle.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.900
Val.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.400
Let's see what Val has to say.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.000
Hello?

19:12.300 --> 19:13.499
Uh, yeah.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.700
Hey, uh, is Val around?

19:16.300 --> 19:18.100
Catherine?

19:19.100 --> 19:20.100
Warrick?

19:20.100 --> 19:23.399
I'm afraid she's unable
to come to the phone now.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.900
Permanently.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.199
How'd you get this number?

19:26.200 --> 19:30.000
Valinda called  my apartment homicide vic
last night.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.400
Are there any witnesses?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.000
Unis talked to a couple of guys

19:34.100 --> 19:35.800
that went to the strip club
across the street.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.699
I think they said
they saw a pregnant woman

19:37.700 --> 19:39.999
getting into the vic's car
from the passenger side.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.400
We've got a BOLO out
on Dana Espinosa

19:42.500 --> 19:44.300
in connection
with the apartment homicides.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.300
She's considered
armed, dangerous and pregnant.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.499
Ooh, raging hormones and a gun?

19:49.500 --> 19:51.300
We've got to get that
off the streets fast.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.800
What's the plan?

20:22.500 --> 20:23.900
Look who it is.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.300
Mom and Dad.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.200
One big happy family, huh?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.700
Yeah, sort of.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.500
Get in the car.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.700
I got a feeling
I'm going to regret this.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.700
i already do

21:04.300 --> 21:06.700
You have reached the voice mail
of Bruce Zagberg,

21:06.700 --> 21:07.900
Registered Financial Planner.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.100
Please leave a message.

21:10.700 --> 21:11.700
Voice mail again.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.100
It's 'cause you don't call

21:13.100 --> 21:14.300
Zig-Zag Bruce.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.400
He calls you, man.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.399
Is there a burger joint
or something around here?

21:18.400 --> 21:20.200
No, but what makes you so sure

21:20.300 --> 21:22.600
Dana would go
to this guy Bruce anyway?

21:22.700 --> 21:23.999
If Dana's on the run,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.800
she gonna need some
on-the-run money.

21:25.900 --> 21:29.999
Let's say Zig-Zag handles
certain aspects of my finances.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.900
What, like laundering
the street vig?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.700
No. Actually, my 401k.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.600
Why are you always tossing
the pimp card at me, man?

21:38.100 --> 21:40.699
<i>I guess to you,
a black man in a suit is a pimp.</i>

21:40.700 --> 21:43.000
Oh. Did I hurt your feelings?

21:50.700 --> 21:52.200
So, is this the place?

21:53.600 --> 21:54.700
What?

21:54.800 --> 21:56.200
You just gonna leave me here?

21:56.300 --> 21:57.700
Yup.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.800
Zig-Zag Bruce ain't
gonna tell you squat.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.400
Wonder what the schools are like
around here.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.300
What?

22:09.800 --> 22:12.500
You know, seems like
a nice neighborhood.

22:12.800 --> 22:15.099
Yeah, probably
some sweet little

22:15.100 --> 22:18.100
foreclosures
coming up soon, too.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.699
Sounds like you're thinking
about settling down.

22:20.700 --> 22:21.900
Looks like you
were finally right

22:22.000 --> 22:23.600
about something.

22:26.100 --> 22:29.000
Single nine-millimeter
shell casing.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.700
Consistent
with the other murders.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.300
How about the neighbors?

22:32.600 --> 22:33.500
Nobody at home.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.900
Parents at work,
kids at school,

22:35.000 --> 22:36.800
and nannies don't like
talking to cops.

22:36.900 --> 22:38.200
What about Drops?

22:38.200 --> 22:40.100
He give us anything
besides more bodies?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.700
No, not yet.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.500
I'll process.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.700
Okay.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.700
So, who else
would Dana go to for help?

22:54.700 --> 22:57.300
Zig-Zag doesn't seem
to be a very big talker.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
You're a lot funnier
than I remember, Crime-Lab.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.100
You been going to
cop comedy school?

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
Answer the question, Kellen.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.900
I got a stepsister, Sherry.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.400
Her and Dana are pretty tight.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.900
If Dana's not with
her,

23:11.900 --> 23:13.900
Sherry should   at least know something.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.500
Jackson and D.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.100
Let's go.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.299
Jackson and D. Yippee.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.500
We're going to the hood.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.100
Yeah, that's her right there.

23:40.800 --> 23:41.600
The round one.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.400
Check this out
here, fellas.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.300
Y'all gonna have to let me
do this one solo.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.700
Sherry's allergic to badges.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.200
Okay, look at this.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.500
Instant
antihistamine.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.800
Look, man, the cop entourage
just ain't

23:55.800 --> 23:57.900
gonna cut it. Nah.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.900
I need to be alone.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.200
I mean, come on.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.500
Where am I going?

24:02.500 --> 24:04.500
You got your
game boy on me.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.500
Okay, check it out.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.300
I'll cover the street.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.800
What about the cuffs, yo? Cuff?

24:24.400 --> 24:24.900
Now, why the hell

24:25.000 --> 24:27.800
would anybody talk to someone
that's already arrested?

24:27.900 --> 24:28.600
Okay.

24:28.700 --> 24:32.500
Okay, Kellen, give me that.
Give me that.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.700
What about a business card?

24:34.800 --> 24:35.699
You know, just in case

24:35.700 --> 24:37.200
Dana ain't around,
Sherry can get

24:37.200 --> 24:39.000
in contact with us, you know?

24:39.000 --> 24:39.800
Okay.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.400
Don't make me look bad.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.000
Do the right thing.

24:45.200 --> 24:45.700
Cool.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.600
The Church on the Move.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.600
Hey, Sher.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.900
Oh, uh-uh.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.300
You escape from jail?!

25:06.300 --> 25:07.600
<i>No. Hell, no...</i>

25:07.700 --> 25:09.300
Oh, so they just
let you out, huh?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.200
Well, I mean...

25:11.300 --> 25:12.600
Lying sack!

25:12.700 --> 25:14.600
You don't think I see 'em?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.599
You trying to get everybody
you know arrested,

25:17.600 --> 25:18.400
or maimed, or killed?

25:18.400 --> 25:22.200
Huh?! You a snake now?! A rat?!

25:22.200 --> 25:22.600
Wait a minute.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.599
Miss me with the BS,
all right, Sher?

25:24.600 --> 25:27.600
I'm just looking for...
For what?! For another
damn shortcut?!

25:27.600 --> 25:29.000
Dana's mother was killed.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.200
J.J. was
killed, too,

25:31.700 --> 25:32.900
and Dana's missing.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.800
Now, the cops got me out
to help find her.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.300
I thought maybe you
might know where she is.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
Last time I talked to her
was the night before last.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.900
She wasn't feeling too good.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.100
Had to cancel her regular
Bingo night with her mama.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.800
Well, listen, all right?

25:48.800 --> 25:50.500
If she does come
around here,

25:50.500 --> 25:52.400
or calls you, I
need you to call

25:52.500 --> 25:55.500
Captain Jim Brass,
or Nick Stokes...

25:57.000 --> 25:59.100
...at the Crime Lab.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.300
Don't look at
me like that,

26:03.400 --> 26:04.800
Sherry, please, all
right? Just do it.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.900
Hold on.

26:33.900 --> 26:34.800
Stop where you are, Kellen,

26:34.800 --> 26:35.799
and drop the bag!

26:35.800 --> 26:37.200
Why?!
Drop the bag!

26:37.200 --> 26:38.199
What did I do...?
Drop it!

26:38.200 --> 26:38.499
I didn't even do nothing.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.900
Drops.
Okay.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.400
Hands above your head.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.700
Don't move.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Oh, that is funky.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.599
What is that nasty stuff?!

26:46.600 --> 26:47.900
Chicken gizzards!

26:47.900 --> 26:49.499
Hey, we're not
on a lunch break here.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.000
At least in jail, I got one.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.500
What'd she tell you?
Nothing.
She told him nothing.

26:53.500 --> 26:54.600
All right, come on, Kellen.
We're going to jail.

26:54.700 --> 26:55.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

26:55.700 --> 26:55.999
No, no, no, no, no!

26:56.000 --> 26:57.799
There's one more place
to go.
Where?

26:57.800 --> 26:59.300
The office
at my after-hours spot.

26:59.300 --> 27:00.999
Why would Dana
go there?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.300
Maybe to check out
the big-ass safe I got.

27:03.300 --> 27:04.700
Let's go. Ugh!

28:00.000 --> 28:02.300
Display last destination.

28:05.700 --> 28:06.800
Hey!

28:08.100 --> 28:10.200
Got the autopsy report
on Valinda Carlisle.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.899
Thought I'd save you
a trip to the morgue.

28:12.900 --> 28:13.700
Nice.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.799
I found Jessica Jayne's purse
in the glove compartment.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.699
Really?

28:19.700 --> 28:22.900
And address to the Glanville
Apartments on the GPS.

28:24.100 --> 28:25.500
Okay.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.400
So they were in it together.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.500
Valinda drives J.J.
to shake down Drops' family

28:32.600 --> 28:33.900
for some cash.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.000
It goes bad.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.400
J.J. kills
the mother,

28:38.400 --> 28:40.199
Dana kills J.J.,

28:40.200 --> 28:42.800
Valinda flees the scene,

28:42.800 --> 28:44.300
and, the next night,

28:45.100 --> 28:47.399
the pissed-off
pregnant chick

28:47.400 --> 28:50.600
tracks down Valinda
and pays her back.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.800
That seems plausible,
but there's something still off.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.800
The bullet entered
through the back of the skull,

28:59.300 --> 29:02.700
and it exited
through the forehead, and...

29:03.400 --> 29:05.100
...out through the open window.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.700
I think you got lucky.

29:15.800 --> 29:16.900
The buet grazed
the window frame

29:16.900 --> 29:18.900
on its way out.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.100
Gives you a trajectory.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.100
Well, that's good,

29:24.300 --> 29:25.400
but the witnesses say

29:25.500 --> 29:27.100
that Valinda was
in the driver's seat

29:27.500 --> 29:30.900
when Dana got in the car,
and if that's true, then,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.800
Dana had to shoot Valinda
like this,

29:34.400 --> 29:37.200
not like this.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.100
That seems
kind of   awkward, don't you think?

29:41.200 --> 29:44.800
Yeah, but awkward or not,
it definitely lines up the shot.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.800
Well, it seems to me

29:45.900 --> 29:46.599
<i>that the shot came</i>

29:46.600 --> 29:48.100
<i>from the back seat.</i>

29:50.300 --> 29:52.900
There was someone else
in the car.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.700
Yeah, Dana was here
about an hour ago.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.700
She was with some
NASCAR-looking dude.

30:06.700 --> 30:09.200
And what exactly does
a NASCAR-looking dude look like?

30:09.700 --> 30:10.700
Kind of like you.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.300
But this guy's
all inked up.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.299
He's got that
loco look.

30:14.300 --> 30:17.500
You just let a complete stranger
into your boss' office?

30:18.200 --> 30:20.100
I thought you were
a smart businessman.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.000
I mean, it was
Dana, your girl.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.200
I didn't ask questions.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.400
What is this?

30:28.600 --> 30:30.500
And where's
the DJ?

30:30.500 --> 30:31.700
That's Mini-Britney.

30:31.700 --> 30:32.900
It's what the people want.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.200
Anybody hungry?

30:40.200 --> 30:42.200
I'm going on a sandwich run.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.100
At least let me get that.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.500
Fine.
Fine.

30:49.200 --> 30:49.999
Warwick,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.600
take me back to jail.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.100
Yeah, see, I got cameras
all over this place, man.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.900
Let's see who she's with.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.400
Let's run this
back an hour.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.900
Looks like
Dana cleaned you out, man.

31:13.900 --> 31:15.800
Nah, wasn't nothing
in that safe, man.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.200
Only Dana didn't know that.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.600
So, how come
you never told us that before?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.600
You guys sprung me to help find her,

31:21.600 --> 31:23.000
and that's
what I'm doing.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.200
There she is.

31:30.700 --> 31:31.499
Wait a minute.

31:31.500 --> 31:32.700
That's Jessica Jaynes'
husband, Walter.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.799
What's Dana doing with him?

31:34.800 --> 31:36.000
Beats the hell out of me.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.399
Walter's J.J.'s pimp.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.800
Your favorite word.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.800
He all about the cash.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.000
Dude's a man-bitch.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.299
Takes care of the kid

31:45.300 --> 31:47.600
while she goes out
and makes the money.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.100
Ev tattoos her waist

31:49.200 --> 31:51.500
every time
she pulls a high-roller trick.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.200
Another notch
on her belt, I guess.

31:55.200 --> 31:55.700
I think

31:59.000 --> 32:00.400
J.J. was after your money.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.699
Now Walter's after it,

32:01.700 --> 32:03.800
and he's taken your girlfriend
hostage to get it.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.700
BRASS:
Where's the
money, Kellen?

32:05.700 --> 32:06.700
'Cause I'm betting that's where

32:06.800 --> 32:08.100
we're going
to find the both of them.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.000
Well, talk to my lawyers.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.900
Better yet,
talk to the tax dudes.

32:11.900 --> 32:12.900
They know where it is.

32:12.900 --> 32:15.300
House special, times three.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.500
What's this look
like, a party?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Okay, I'll check the outside cameras,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.300
see if we can see where they went.

32:30.700 --> 32:33.500
I need to put a BOLO out
on Walter Jaynes.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.200
I'm gonna put
some more mayonnaise

32:35.300 --> 32:36.700
on this dry-ass sandwich.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.700
Kellen!

33:22.300 --> 33:25.000
LVPD.Move! Move!

33:28.200 --> 33:29.800
Move! Move!

33:34.400 --> 33:36.800
ñiÑoe in a, uh...

33:48.800 --> 33:50.399
A piece-of-crap
blue station wagon.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.999
Nevada plates, K-C-Z.
That's all I got.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.400
A blue station wagon,
partial plates,

33:55.400 --> 33:57.000
Kilo-Charlie-Zebra.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.600
Dale?!

34:01.400 --> 34:02.999
What did you give Drops?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.100
Turkey sandwich.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.900
You want to play around
with me, huh?

34:06.900 --> 34:08.000
You're under arrest.

34:08.100 --> 34:08.998
For what, serving sandwiches?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.699
Aiding and abetting. Cuff him.

34:10.699 --> 34:13.500
Hey, man. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.400
Look... Look, um...

34:16.400 --> 34:18.699
Look, it was a GPS jammer melt.

34:18.699 --> 34:19.600
A what?

34:28.600 --> 34:29.299
I need you to call

34:29.300 --> 34:32.699
Captain Jim Brass,
or Nick Stokes

34:32.699 --> 34:34.400
at the Crime Lab.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.100
Don't look at
me like that,

34:35.100 --> 34:37.500
Sherry, please, alright?
Just do it!

34:38.199 --> 34:38.998
Get him out of here.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.100
Come on, man.
I told you everything.

34:40.100 --> 34:41.400
You still gonna
arrest me?

34:41.400 --> 34:43.300
I was just taking
orders, man.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.800
Hey, Grissom, don't worry.

34:47.800 --> 34:48.399
We're gonna get him.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.900
The undersheriff will be pleased
to know that.

34:50.900 --> 34:52.299
The nine-millimeter casing found

34:52.300 --> 34:54.199
at the business manager's
apartment,

34:54.199 --> 34:56.799
and the one
from Valinda Carlisle's car

34:56.800 --> 34:58.499
were fired in the same gun.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.100
No surprises there.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.300
Yeah, but it's not the gun

35:01.300 --> 35:03.599
that was used
to kill Jessica Jaynes.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.399
I think Walter Jaynes is the one
who's on a rampage here,

35:06.400 --> 35:08.399
and he's dragging Dana Espinosa
with him.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.499
Any idea where?

35:09.500 --> 35:10.899
No. No, not yet.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.599
You might want
to work on that, Nick.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.399
We got a lead on the station
wagon that scooped up Drops.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.499
The registered owner
is Walter Jaynes.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.700
He must have had Dana
in t car with him.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.099
Walter wouldn't just let him
in the car to protect the girl.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.100
Drops must have something
he wants.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.700
The money.

35:25.900 --> 35:31.000
What we have here...
is a misunderstanding.

35:32.300 --> 35:34.299
Hmm. I understand
it just fine.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.399
My J.J. bangs
one of your whales

35:36.400 --> 35:40.000
24-7 from Christmas
to New Year's,

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
and you stiff us.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.800
Wait. Wait. Stiff you?

35:42.800 --> 35:43.999
I got busted.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.199
I went to jail.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.199
Technically, I'm still in jail.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.799
And my baby doesn't
have a mother.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.199
Neither does Dana.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.099
I'm sorry. I thought
she was gonna kill me, too.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.299
Shut up!
DROPS:
Calm down.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.399
Look, look, look at me.
Walter, look at me.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.000
Don't even listen
to her. Walter!

35:58.000 --> 36:00.599
Walter, look at me!
See this here? Look.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.099
50 Gs, baby.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.300
I won't even take my cut.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.900
That's very generous.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.400
So, uh,

36:09.500 --> 36:10.900
we good to go?

36:10.900 --> 36:12.700
You owe me something else.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.700
What? The vig?

36:15.800 --> 36:17.900
What's that, 25 more?

36:17.900 --> 36:19.600
You can take the whole couch
if you want to.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.099
No, no, no, no.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.700
I got my pay.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.300
I need my payback.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.100
I lost my wife.

36:30.100 --> 36:34.000
I'm going to let you choose
which one you lose.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.100
Either your girl...

36:37.300 --> 36:39.200
...or your baby.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.100
Drops' GPS just came back up.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.400
He's definitely
at the apartment.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.999
Well, either
the jammer died, or...

36:57.000 --> 36:59.400
Yeah, or he's calling
for help.
Okay, listen up.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.699
We got a hostage situation

37:00.700 --> 37:03.399
at the Glanville apartment,
6555 Vegas Valley.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.400
We're gonna make
a silent approach.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.600
Everybody copy?

37:08.200 --> 37:11.500
Look... I can't choose.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.600
Either you choose,

37:14.000 --> 37:14.999
or I choose.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.300
Choose!

37:38.400 --> 37:39.600
Okay.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.900
The choice is made.
No!

37:58.500 --> 38:00.400
Get that scumbag out of here!

38:02.500 --> 38:05.000
Oh, man! Oh, Damn!

38:05.200 --> 38:06.800
We have two
gunshot victims

38:06.800 --> 38:09.200
at the Glanville Apartments.
Code Three.

38:09.300 --> 38:09.999
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.099
Damn. Her water broke.

38:11.100 --> 38:12.099
Trauma from the shot.

38:12.100 --> 38:13.600
One of the victims
is a pregnant woman.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.000
She's going
into labor.

38:15.700 --> 38:17.600
That's all I got right there.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.700
Oh, the baby's coming!

38:19.700 --> 38:20.999
Just keeping breathing, Dana.

38:21.000 --> 38:21.800
Just keep breathing, okay?

38:21.800 --> 38:23.500
Paramedics are on their way.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.399
Here. Relax.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.600
That's it. That's it.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.600
He looks healthy.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.300
How are you?
You good?

39:04.300 --> 39:05.700
Sore.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.300
I want to hold him.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.000
No.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.300
No?

39:14.900 --> 39:16.400
That's my son.

39:16.700 --> 39:18.700
I don't want you
to hold him, Kellen.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.100
Because of you,

39:22.300 --> 39:25.799
I heard my mother die.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.600
Where's the money?!

39:27.600 --> 39:29.300
I don't have
anything!
Drops' money!

39:29.400 --> 39:30.799
Who?! Just take what
you want and leave,

39:30.800 --> 39:32.400
or I'm calling
the police!

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I didn't even know it was J.J.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.400
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

39:37.800 --> 39:40.799
I shot her and ran,
and then Valinda called.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.899
She said she heard
what happened.

39:42.900 --> 39:46.200
Said she wanted to help me.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.400
Thank you, Val.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.199
I am so freaked out right now.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.400
I am so sorry.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.900
Walter made Val call me.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.600
<i>She was just bait.</i>

40:00.100 --> 40:02.400
Walter said
you owed him some money.

40:03.100 --> 40:06.100
You told me you
didn't have anything.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.899
So I took Walter to Zig-Zag,

40:09.900 --> 40:11.700
thinking he would help.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.100
And when he didn't,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.100
he killed him, too.

40:18.100 --> 40:20.100
And for what?

40:20.400 --> 40:21.500
So that you could hide
all the money

40:21.600 --> 40:22.699
and keep it for yourself?

40:22.700 --> 40:24.200
I had to.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.300
The tax dudes
would have taken it.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.900
And, technically,
I didn't hide it.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.399
I left it with your mother.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.200
Don't BS me, Kellen.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.599
Babe, listen,
okay, seriously.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.100
Seriously, you would
have spent it.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.700
Then, where would we be?

40:40.800 --> 40:43.199
Hmm? Hmm?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.700
That was for our future, Mommy.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.600
We don't have a future.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.900
When you get out, we'll be gone.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.400
You can't do that.

40:54.400 --> 40:58.300
We're not married,
and you're a convict.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.000
I can do what I want.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.900
Okay, Drops,
that's it.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.100
Time to go, man.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.600
We got to get you transferred

41:07.600 --> 41:09.900
back to the prison
hospital, okay?

41:18.900 --> 41:21.200
Is Dana gonna do any time
for offing J.J.?

41:21.900 --> 41:22.599
Oh, I doubt it.

41:22.600 --> 41:25.300
Sounds like a
pretty good case of
self-defense to me.

41:25.300 --> 41:26.700
What about the money?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.500
I'm not expecting anything.
Just wondering.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.000
Well, technically,
it's the mother's.

41:30.100 --> 41:31.499
It was her apartment.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.300
Dana's the only beneficiary,
so the money's really hers.

41:34.300 --> 41:37.400
And my kid's.
Yeah.

41:37.500 --> 41:40.100
For once, I did something
good in my life.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.600
Oh, your life ain't
over yet, Kellen.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.500
It ain't over yet.
