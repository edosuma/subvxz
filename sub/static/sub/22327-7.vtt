[soft beep]

00:38.038 --> 00:39.789
I'll meet you outside Ops.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.541
[beeps]

00:41.624 --> 00:42.500
Copy that.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.056
[car horn honks]

00:56.848 --> 00:58.641
[Trevor] Whoa. That's the boss!

01:00.101 --> 01:00.935
Road trip.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.270
You're such a kid.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.189
Yeah, on the outside. What's that?

01:04.272 --> 01:05.106
Whoop.

01:05.690 --> 01:06.649
Freak, man.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.328
What?

01:18.411 --> 01:19.913
[knock on door]

01:27.921 --> 01:28.755
Ohh.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.925
Wow, they're beautiful.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.426
Thank you.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.724
[sniffs]

01:44.312 --> 01:45.146
"Mom."

01:46.523 --> 01:48.066
Mom remembered.

01:56.324 --> 02:00.453
"Happy anniversary, Grant."

02:06.334 --> 02:07.335
[Carly] No service?

02:07.418 --> 02:09.003
Not one bar.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.506
Should have called when we stopped
at that gas station.

02:11.589 --> 02:12.423
[Carly] Told you.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.050
Yeah, then we got lost.

02:14.759 --> 02:15.969
How long till impact?

02:16.761 --> 02:18.888
Twenty-three minutes, six seconds.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.265
-Ish.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.975
No, pretty much exactly.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.060
I'll have to call after the mission.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.188
I don't understand the big deal
about anniversaries, anyway.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.649
My father missed
a 25th a few months back.

02:29.732 --> 02:30.567
[MacLaren] And?

02:30.650 --> 02:33.153
Gary paid a heavy price, boss.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.364
Well, fortunately,
Kat's a reasonable person.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.074
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.784
You're already in the dog house.

02:39.868 --> 02:40.702
Oh, come on.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.829
No, she's right.
Your window was early this morning.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.122
It's already closed.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.708
-How do you know this information?
-Covered it in training.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.334
Twenty-first century female behavior.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.587
Ah. Well, I'll buy her flowers, then.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.880
What anniversary is it?

02:51.963 --> 02:53.798
-Ten years.
-[Carly] Yikes.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.008
Whoa.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.677
You're just screwing with me.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.096
Nah, ten's a big one. Even I know that.

03:00.179 --> 03:03.099
Okay, well, help me out.
What's an appropriate gift for ten years?

03:03.182 --> 03:04.809
-Tin.
-Yeah, ten.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.311
-No, tin.
-As in the metal.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.605
-Tin?
-That's the traditional gift.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.648
I'm supposed to give her something
made from tin?

03:10.732 --> 03:12.650
If you are a traditionalist, yes.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.486
There's a more modern anniversary theme
for ten years,

03:15.570 --> 03:18.740
-but you're not gonna like it.
-Diamonds.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.327
-Now I know you're making this up.
-Technically, diamond jewelry.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.661
-Yes.
-Seriously!

03:23.745 --> 03:26.247
You might have gotten away
with flowers if you'd called.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.000
[mocking] Flowers if I called...

03:33.838 --> 03:35.882
[MacLaren] Where does it come down?

03:35.965 --> 03:37.759
Six hundred meters to our south-southwest

03:37.842 --> 03:39.594
in seven minutes, eight seconds.

03:39.677 --> 03:40.929
There-ish.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.766
It's amazing this becomes a dry lake bed
in 50 years.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.476
Do we need to worry about a wave?

03:46.559 --> 03:49.229
Nah. Probably a splash. It's not too big.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.482
Just extremely rare and important
to the future.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.651
More rare than that other mineral--
what was it?

03:55.693 --> 03:56.527
Diamond.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.820
That's the one.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.031
Yeah, all right,
just get the recovery gear ready,

04:00.114 --> 04:01.699
make sure everything's working.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.493
The Director gave us
an important mission.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.827
Let's get it right.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.249

-[beeps]

06:07.950 --> 06:11.162
You've reached Special Agent
Grant MacLaren. Please leave a message.

[beeping]

06:23.758 --> 06:24.967
[cell phone ringing]

06:28.387 --> 06:29.388
Wakefield.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.308
[woman]  This is an emergency
communication, protocol alpha.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.810
Protocol alpha? Who is this?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.937
This is Traveler 5001.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.689
We have less than 60 seconds
before signal loss.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.191
I'm listening.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.778
I need armed air assets
to the following coordinates ASAP:

06:44.362 --> 06:46.364
49.3506 degrees north,

06:46.447 --> 06:49.033
122.8599 degrees west.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.409
Can you do this?

06:52.036 --> 06:55.039
Possibly. I have a helicopter already
in the air with agents aboard,

06:55.123 --> 06:56.290
but they're not travelers.

06:56.374 --> 07:00.461
I said protocol alpha. Can you get them
to these coordinates in 17 minutes?

07:00.545 --> 07:04.382
Negative. Best case is... 25 to 30.

07:04.465 --> 07:05.883
What about assets on the ground?

07:05.967 --> 07:08.010
Twenty-five minutes
is our closest anything.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.512
You're talking the middle of nowhere.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.223
I do have agents on the ground
within roughly--

07:12.306 --> 07:13.850
[line clicks]

07:13.933 --> 07:14.934
Hello?

07:15.017 --> 07:16.853
[parachute fluttering]

07:29.282 --> 07:32.201
[panting] Give me the keys!

07:32.785 --> 07:33.911
[chuckles] Right.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.997
How about just wait till
your little brother touches down first?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.832
It's an emergency.
Give me the fucking keys!

07:38.749 --> 07:39.876
They're in the ignition.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.753
Wait, what emergency?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.214
Carrie, what's wrong?

07:45.298 --> 07:48.217
Just tell me what's going on.
I'll drive you myself!

07:49.218 --> 07:50.052
Carrie!

07:51.137 --> 07:51.971
Carrie!

07:56.476 --> 07:59.687

[Carly] No service?

08:34.639 --> 08:35.973
Not one bar.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.518
Should have called when we stopped
at that gas station.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.435
I told you.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.980
Yeah, then we got lost.
How long till meteor impact?

08:43.064 --> 08:45.525
Twenty-two minutes, 51 seconds.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.651
-Ish.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.236
No, pretty much exactly.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.197
I'll call her after the mission.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.908
I don't understand the big deal
about anniversaries anyway.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.827
Well, my father forgot their 25th
a few months back.

08:56.911 --> 08:57.745
And?

08:57.828 --> 08:59.622
Gary paid a heavy price, boss.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.043
Luckily, Kat's a reasonable person.

09:04.126 --> 09:05.753
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.463
You're already doomed.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.158
Oh, my gosh, that's a big gun.

09:36.242 --> 09:40.037
Um, am I on private property right now?
I'm so lost.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.583
Do you-- you want me to go back?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.043
Okay, I can-- I can do that.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.421
Um, can you just tell me
where Alouette Lake is?

09:49.630 --> 09:51.882
Are you telling me
the lake's back that way,

09:51.966 --> 09:55.845
or are you still telling me
to turn around?

09:58.055 --> 09:58.889
Okay.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.559
[thuds]

10:13.821 --> 10:15.615
[shouts, grunts]

10:20.703 --> 10:21.704
Jesus.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.624
Callahan!

10:29.920 --> 10:30.755
What is it?

10:30.838 --> 10:32.465
Where did the Fraser meteor come down?

10:32.548 --> 10:34.342
A dry lake bed just northeast of here.
Why?

10:34.425 --> 10:36.052
It wasn't dry this early in the 21st.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.511
What's going on?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.805
I just got off the phone with a traveler
who requested armed assets

10:39.889 --> 10:42.391
at the exact same coordinates
the meteor was historically found

10:42.475 --> 10:43.684
fifty years from now.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.228
We got cut off, but she said
it was protocol alpha.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.605
How's that possible?

10:47.688 --> 10:50.358
What if Robert Fraser hadn't
discovered that element in 2068?

10:50.441 --> 10:53.069
There'd be no room temperature
superconductor for quantum processing,

10:53.152 --> 10:56.489
no leap in artificial intelligence,
no consciousness transfer technology--

10:56.572 --> 10:57.782
No Director.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.243
-Do we know when the meteor came down?
-I'm no historian,

11:01.327 --> 11:04.705
but I'm about to bet my job with the FBI
that it's sometime in the next 15 minutes,

11:04.789 --> 11:07.166
and that the Faction is trying
to get to it before we do.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.460
The Director overwrote
all the Faction members.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.254
Only Faction members he could get eyes on.
There could be hundreds still there.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.340
Or worse, it's somebody else.

[Carly] It's amazing to me this becomes
a dry lake bed in 50 years.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.746
[Marcy] Do we need to worry
about a wave?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.874
Nah, probably just a splash.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.459
Nothing too big.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.961
Just extremely rare
and important to the future.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.422
Even more rare than that other
mineral-- what was it again?

12:36.505 --> 12:39.216
-You mean diamond?
-[laughs] That's it.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.303
Let's get the recovery gear ready
and make sure everything's working.

12:42.386 --> 12:45.264
The Director gave us an important mission.
Let's not mess it up.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.933

No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.074
Well, then, help me out.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.326
What's an appropriate gift
for ten years?

16:34.410 --> 16:35.995
-Tin.
-Yeah, ten.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.329
No, tin.

16:37.913 --> 16:38.914
Like soup tin?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.624
As in the metallic element.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.960
That's the traditional gift.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.087
I'm supposed to give her something made
from tin?

16:51.719 --> 16:53.721
You cut the deployment close.
What happened?

16:53.804 --> 16:54.805
We collided.

16:54.888 --> 16:58.100
He's unconscious, but I managed to get
his parachute open before we separated.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.769
[man] If he lands like that,
he'll break his neck.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.187
You have any weapons in the car?

17:02.271 --> 17:03.439
-What?
-Weapons.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.274
No.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.943
What are you doing?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.446
The camera saw a knife in the pickup.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.363

I'm lost. Can you help me?

18:32.736 --> 18:36.657
Oh... okay. Fine.
But... this place is where?

18:37.241 --> 18:38.492
I need to know.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.375
[groans]

18:56.885 --> 18:58.679
[Carly] Might have gotten away
with flowers if you'd called.

18:58.762 --> 19:01.390
Yeah, we established I made a mistake.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.475
[Marcy] Now you gotta get her
a diamond something.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.560
Really?

19:04.643 --> 19:08.438
Explain how buying something hard
and shiny and artificially expensive

19:08.522 --> 19:11.024
that is controlled by a cartel
gets me out of the dog pound.

Dog house.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.653
Were you trained at all
in 21st century male behavior?

19:14.736 --> 19:16.446
[Trevor] I think he's nailing it.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.782
Historically, diamonds have
been a rare and precious gift.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.783
Oh, shut up.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.618

19:21.702 --> 19:23.495
Yeah, if it's rare and precious she wants,

19:23.579 --> 19:26.081
I'll chip a fragment off the meteor
after we recover it.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
It could come in handy
if Kathryn ever needs

19:28.250 --> 19:30.711

for quantum processing.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.212

20:40.489 --> 20:42.032
Hey, it's me.

20:42.866 --> 20:45.869
Just giving you the benefit
of the doubt here.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.873
I know you're probably busy on a case,
and I married an FBI agent,

20:49.957 --> 20:54.836
but I'm assuming when you write
"Won't be by tonight-- work" in a text,

20:54.920 --> 20:57.005
it just means that you're
gonna be late.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.091
Because tonight of all nights,

20:59.174 --> 21:02.094
we should spend some time together,
no matter what time it is.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.220
Hint, hint.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.184
Okay, so, I'm gonna plan something
for later. Nothing fancy.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.604
You just need to let me know
roughly when that will be.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.315
You can even text me.

21:16.566 --> 21:17.401

a happy anniversary text before that,

of emotion that I'm feeling at the moment.

in telling you that information,

33:39.308 --> 33:41.310
and maybe I was wrong.

33:41.394 --> 33:45.231
But it's pretty obvious to me,
and probably everyone else,

33:45.314 --> 33:47.567
that the new Marcy is different
from the old one

33:47.650 --> 33:50.153

to put me back together...

you didn't turn.

Sure doesn't look anything like

in telling you that information.

Maybe I was wrong.
