15:39.314 --> 15:40.370
- Yeah alright,

15:40.370 --> 15:42.367
but we probably don't know anything
you haven't already figured out.

15:43.026 --> 15:43.860
- It won't take long.

16:00.790 --> 16:03.528
- So I take it you haven't seen Jane recently,

16:03.528 --> 16:05.090
otherwise, you wouldn't be here, right?

16:05.340 --> 16:06.636
- Oh well actually-

16:06.636 --> 16:09.177
- Yeah, we haven't seen her since
she left for rehab.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.013
- Were you gonna say something James?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.399
- Oh uh no.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.662
Well, yeah actually.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.724
I was gonna say I visited her once in rehab.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.397
- Oh that's right,

16:20.397 --> 16:22.044
you two were always so close,

16:22.482 --> 16:25.293
but you haven't seen her recently, right?

16:25.293 --> 16:26.402
- Yes that's correct.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.197
- And do you know her new boyfriend?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.032
I think his name is Bryan?

16:31.533 --> 16:33.637
Yeah, Bryan um...

16:33.785 --> 16:35.787
Sounds familiar, I might have heard of him,

16:35.787 --> 16:37.556
but I don't think I know him
personally or anything.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.547
He seems like trouble to me.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.918
I've heard Jane on the phone with him.

16:42.877 --> 16:46.422
He just doesn't treat her with the respect she deserves.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.674
- What do you mean?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.990
- After their calls, I can always tell,

16:50.134 --> 16:52.512
because Jane seems anxious and distracted.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.265
Do you know this Bryan's last name?

16:56.015 --> 16:58.059
I can't seem to identify him to the police,

16:58.059 --> 17:00.854
but he seems like a prime suspect to me.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.304
- I want to say it starts with like a b?

17:05.275 --> 17:07.151
But like I really couldn't say for sure.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.238
- I mean I wish I did, but

17:10.655 --> 17:12.156
Jane hasn't even mentioned him to me.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.922
- Hmm, she can be like that.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.036
She hides herself from others.

17:18.663 --> 17:19.628
Anyway,

17:19.998 --> 17:23.334
what's the talk like in your circles
about Katie's disappearance?

17:23.334 --> 17:25.795
Like, what are people your age saying?

17:26.421 --> 17:27.171
- Well,

17:27.368 --> 17:29.114
no one really knows what to make of it,

17:29.114 --> 17:30.648
everyone's definitely on edge though.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.262
Do the cops think this is related
to Katie's disappearance?

17:35.013 --> 17:37.945
- It's only logical for the two of them to be connected.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.436
Two girls disappearing
within the same week of each other?

17:41.686 --> 17:42.520
In this town?

17:42.722 --> 17:44.063
It just makes sense.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.691
- Yeah, I mean it's kind of important to remember that...

17:47.525 --> 17:51.112
Jane and Katie were
two very different kind of girls.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.611
- With alcohol,

18:42.205 --> 18:44.374
it's obvious you two have been drinking.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.501
Did you know that Jane, like her father, was
an alcoholic?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.179
That's why she went to rehab.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.503
I used to think I knew her.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.819
I had a whole plan of how to raise her right.

19:06.819 --> 19:08.447
She was gonna be perfect.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.384
Then, after her father left,

19:12.568 --> 19:14.911
I had to
make sure she didn't follow in his footsteps.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.772
But I didn't do enough.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.810
By the time I found
out she'd started drinking,

19:20.368 --> 19:23.705
her alcoholism had eroded away the girl I had raised.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.723
- I'm really sorry Ms. Booker.

19:25.957 --> 19:26.499
I didn't mean to-

19:26.582 --> 19:30.001
- Were you guys with her, when she started drinking?

19:30.461 --> 19:31.796
Did you pressure her?

19:32.005 --> 19:34.215
- No no Ms. Booker that wasn't us,

19:34.298 --> 19:35.008
we would never do that.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.790
- Were you gonna get her drunk tonight?

19:36.790 --> 19:37.927
Is that why you came here?

19:38.052 --> 19:39.500
- No no, absolutely not!

19:39.500 --> 19:41.305
Hey James, I think it's time we start heading out.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.017
- Yeah, our parents are probably
expecting us home soon.

did you hear anything weird?

20:09.250 --> 20:09.751

She sounded distressed.

20:15.519 --> 20:16.871
I feel like I heard something too,

20:17.175 --> 20:18.582

20:18.582 --> 20:20.039
if she's just down in her room?

20:20.762 --> 20:21.463

20:21.512 --> 20:22.930
It definitely sounded like her though.

20:25.516 --> 20:26.434
- Doesn't Jane have a sister?

20:27.018 --> 20:28.455
- Oh shit yeah, she does.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.687
- It's probably just her sister then,

20:29.770 --> 20:31.189

27:16.150 --> 27:19.180
I've worked up quite an appetite
setting up for your big day.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.621
- Yes, my big day,

27:21.621 --> 27:23.823
the one where you tie me up
and tell me nothing

27:23.823 --> 27:25.352
about what the fuck is going on.

27:26.437 --> 27:30.482
- Think of it as your final step of rehabilitation.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.282
- I'm clean mom.

27:32.282 --> 27:34.028
Whatever this is it, isn't necessary.

27:38.032 --> 27:39.366
- Mm.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.577
I'm sure you think you're clean,

27:42.494 --> 27:45.873
but you still reek
of your past transgressions.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.838
Now, open up!

fresh start,

27:58.719 --> 28:01.764
a second chance at the life you were destined for!

28:02.765 --> 28:04.201

After everything I've done for you?

of my life so you could turn into a woman I could be proud of.

28:29.833 --> 28:33.837
And now it seems like
you're actively trying to derail your entire life!

28:37.591 --> 28:41.847
- Look, I know you're a rebellious teen,

but as your mother,
I know what's best for you.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.759
- And what's best for me is tying me to a chair

28:49.759 --> 28:51.730
and sacrificing me to the devil?

Or whatever you have planned
with your Satan buddies tonight.

- No!

32:02.087 --> 32:03.547
We definitely gotta call the cops.

32:03.839 --> 32:04.923
- No we can't do that.

32:05.132 --> 32:05.841
- Why not?

32:06.008 --> 32:07.595
- Because it's my word against my mom's.

32:07.595 --> 32:08.844
No one would believe me.

32:09.553 --> 32:12.097
Especially since I've lied to cops
before to get away from her.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.765
- Wait, when was that?

32:14.266 --> 32:16.083
- After my dad disappeared,

32:16.083 --> 32:18.637
I genuinely thought my mom had killed him.

32:19.188 --> 32:20.634
But I didn't have any proof,

32:20.634 --> 32:23.734
so I made up a story about how I'd seen her kill him.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.611
I said that I saw her strangle him,

32:27.988 --> 32:29.120
in his sleep, and

32:29.531 --> 32:31.700
take the body outside in the backyard and bury it.

32:32.743 --> 32:34.347
The cops excavated our entire backyard

32:34.347 --> 32:35.935
but they never found anything.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.566
I never said I made it
up, but

32:37.566 --> 32:39.583
it was obvious they all knew.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.631
Then my mom sued the police department,

32:42.878 --> 32:44.689
and they paid
to have our entire backyard fixed,

32:44.689 --> 32:46.742
so if I were to call them up with this kind of story,

32:46.742 --> 32:48.406
they would think it was the same kind of thing,

32:48.406 --> 32:51.136
and without any evidence, they'd have to believe her.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.707
- Hey Bryan,

32:54.707 --> 32:55.501
while I'm here,

32:55.501 --> 32:56.850
you think I could get an
eighth real quick?

32:57.226 --> 32:59.748
- Oh uh yeah sure, I guess.

32:59.748 --> 33:01.015
I got my shit in my room.

33:01.605 --> 33:02.439

- So there's no way we can
stop your mom without evidence?

33:16.245 --> 33:18.214
- I mean she needs me for whatever she has planned tonight,

33:18.214 --> 33:20.249
so as long as I'm with Bryan I'll be safe.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.037
- She knows you're dating someone named Bryan.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.740
She doesn't know his last name,

33:24.740 --> 33:27.245

until the cops figure out
that you're staying here.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.133

33:33.178 --> 33:33.929
- What is it?

33:34.554 --> 33:37.117
- She said she thought Bryan was bad for you,

33:37.117 --> 33:38.892
that he wasn't treating you right.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.022
- Fuck her.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.301
She doesn't know anything
about me.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.704
She was probably just trying to manipulate you,

33:44.704 --> 33:45.857
that's what she does.

33:47.192 --> 33:50.404
And also who is she
to talk about mistreatment?

He's legitimately a great guy.

34:05.610 --> 34:06.810
This is stupid.

Like, we just need some evidence
of your mom trying to hurt you,

34:10.132 --> 34:11.369
then we can take it to the cops

34:11.369 --> 34:12.842
and you'll be safe, right?

34:13.510 --> 34:14.572
- Yeah great idea,

34:14.572 --> 34:16.346
let's just go see my mom,

34:16.346 --> 34:19.370
and you guys can film while she sacrifices me to the devil.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.101
Sounds like a plan.

to back up your story.

34:24.438 --> 34:25.241
Like your sister.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.732
Was she home when this was happening?

34:28.860 --> 34:29.860
she won't be home till summer.

for the ritual that she's planning,

34:47.045 --> 34:48.253

58:53.989 --> 58:54.997
What're we gonna do?

58:55.157 --> 58:56.554
- We have to stop the ritual.

58:56.554 --> 58:58.059
I told Katie we weren't gonna leave her.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.171
- Yeah sure, but how?

59:00.662 --> 59:03.309
- If Jane's mom is killing cops,
what gonna stop her from killing us?

59:04.291 --> 59:06.927

[Water splashes]

59:25.479 --> 59:26.257

59:26.438 --> 59:29.991

the process of your repurification.

By the end,

59:31.568 --> 59:32.623
You'll be as good as new.

59:32.623 --> 59:34.516

59:34.780 --> 59:36.027
Don't you see?

59:36.156 --> 59:37.804
Katie is our sacrifice.

59:38.533 --> 59:40.694
She's pure, unlike you,

59:40.694 --> 59:43.649
and will be the perfect gift
to appease my lord.

59:43.955 --> 59:44.831
- Leave her alone.

if you weren't such a catastrophe,

59:48.627 --> 59:50.380
Katie wouldn't have to die.

59:50.670 --> 59:51.546
This is all your fault.

59:52.547 --> 59:53.976
- You already killed Bryan...

59:54.841 --> 59:55.717
... and that cop.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.379
Just, please,

59:57.511 --> 59:58.532
stop this.

59:58.970 --> 1:00:02.226
The ritual won't fix anything,
it'll just make everything worse.

if you didn't run off!

If you had just stayed here,

1:00:07.812 --> 1:00:09.272
Katie would be the only one...

1:00:09.398 --> 1:00:10.607
...dying tonight.

Nothing's been right since Dad left.

- Oh, things were going wrong
long before he left.

1:00:31.503 --> 1:00:34.148
- You know Dad didn't leave
because of me, right?

1:00:35.340 --> 1:00:38.660
Before he left,
he told me to never trust you.

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:40.635
He said that you
would always put yourself,

1:00:40.635 --> 1:00:42.544
and your desires, above everyone else.

I prioritize the Satanic Order above everything else.

1:00:58.029 --> 1:00:59.794
I'm a selfless being.

1:01:00.282 --> 1:01:03.538
Your father, on the other hand,
was a needy distraction.

1:01:06.413 --> 1:01:07.815
That's why I choose to...

1:01:08.373 --> 1:01:09.267
MS. BOOKER:
...sacrifice him

1:01:09.457 --> 1:01:11.001
to Satan at my coronation.

1:01:12.627 --> 1:01:14.261
And the same goes for your friends,

1:01:14.671 --> 1:01:17.001
if they get in my way,
I'll kill them.

1:01:17.966 --> 1:01:20.592
Their resistance will just lead to more death.

1:01:21.845 --> 1:01:24.264
- Okay, so the ritual
is prolly in the backyard,

1:01:24.264 --> 1:01:26.536
'cause that's where
the black pentagram was, right?

1:01:26.766 --> 1:01:29.571
- Yeah, we're gonna need some weapons
if we wanna stand a chance against Satan.

1:01:30.145 --> 1:01:31.915
- What, you think Satan himself will be there?

1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:34.399

cause we don't know when the ritual's gonna start.

1:01:40.071 --> 1:01:41.854
- It's like ten minutes to midnight.

1:01:41.854 --> 1:01:42.987
I'd say that's a safe bet.

1:01:43.783 --> 1:01:44.400
- True.

1:01:44.784 --> 1:01:46.484
Then, all we need is some weapon and a plan.
