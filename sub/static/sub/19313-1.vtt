02:31.361 --> 02:33.321
All right, get down.

02:39.286 --> 02:41.538
- Where's his papers?
- They're all here.

02:42.456 --> 02:45.333
Don't worry, Sergeant.
You'll find them all in order.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.711
All right. Get in there!

02:48.670 --> 02:49.755
Is that necessary?

02:49.921 --> 02:53.675
- All I want is a nice, dry prison cell.
- Get moving!

03:10.859 --> 03:13.069
Is the balloon still there, Captain?

03:18.784 --> 03:21.453
It's whipping around a bit,
but still waiting for us.

03:21.620 --> 03:23.413
We'll need your blanket, Neb.

03:23.705 --> 03:24.706
Captain?

03:26.625 --> 03:28.251
I think the kid is scared.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.507
Well, aren't you?

03:40.764 --> 03:43.225
- You want a hand with that?
- No, sir.

03:43.308 --> 03:45.101
I've got them both almost through.

03:45.185 --> 03:49.981
Captain, do you think that balloon will fly
in a big wind like this without busting open?

03:50.398 --> 03:53.944
That's not the problem, Herbert. The
problem is whether it'll fly at all.

03:56.738 --> 03:57.739
Captain?

03:59.241 --> 04:02.244
We've never seen more than
the top of it over the houses.

04:02.577 --> 04:04.871
What if there's a whole regiment guarding it?

04:05.121 --> 04:07.666
We'll just have to fight
the whole regiment, Herbert.

04:27.018 --> 04:28.436
Hey, Captain.

04:30.897 --> 04:32.315
They're coming early.

04:36.278 --> 04:37.904
Are we going through with it?

04:38.738 --> 04:40.240
We've got no choice.

05:06.516 --> 05:09.978
I see I shall have company. How charming!

05:10.145 --> 05:12.272
Won't you introduce me to these gentlemen?

05:12.355 --> 05:13.690
Come on, prisoner.

05:36.463 --> 05:38.298
Get their clothes.

05:42.093 --> 05:42.969
Here.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.641
- Here are the keys.
- Now, you both know what to do.

05:48.933 --> 05:49.768
Yes, sir.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.728
Come on, get out of here.

06:16.336 --> 06:17.545
Halt!

06:34.354 --> 06:35.688
Hurry up!

06:37.857 --> 06:39.192
Come on!

07:44.924 --> 07:45.883
Wait!

07:59.022 --> 08:00.273
Don't let me fall!

08:13.369 --> 08:15.830
Lighten the basket. We've got to gain height.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.061
You all right?

08:41.438 --> 08:43.232
Hey, Captain.

09:05.922 --> 09:08.925
All right, let's get this rebel out of here.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.771
That's a mighty long drop.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.149
You sure you know everything
about running this balloon?

09:25.316 --> 09:27.485
Maybe this man could help us.

09:29.153 --> 09:31.197
All right. Tie him up.

09:47.296 --> 09:50.424
Now that we're up here, I suppose
we should introduce ourselves.

09:50.508 --> 09:53.845
- Captain Cyrus Harding.
- Captain, look, food.

09:54.011 --> 09:57.598
This is Neb. Union soldier.

09:57.807 --> 10:02.103
- I'm Herbert Brown, Pennsylvania Infantry.
- Watch it!

10:02.270 --> 10:04.730
Don't all crowd to one side.

10:07.984 --> 10:09.986
I know what uniform that is.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.780
You're a Union war correspondent.

10:13.072 --> 10:14.949
Very observant, young man.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.702
<i>Gideon Spilett, New York Herald.</i>

10:17.868 --> 10:19.829
How much food is in that box, Neb?

10:19.996 --> 10:25.126
Enough for five days, maybe. Four
if Mr. Spilett decides to stay.

10:25.585 --> 10:28.379
That all depends, of course,
on where you're headed.

10:28.588 --> 10:31.340
Wherever the wind takes us, Mr. Spilett.

10:33.968 --> 10:36.345
Looks like your other guest is coming around.

10:37.847 --> 10:40.933
You're my prisoner.
What's your name and rank?

10:41.892 --> 10:43.436
Sergeant Pencroft.

10:43.603 --> 10:45.021
Regiment?

10:47.356 --> 10:50.026
Confederate Army. That's
all you'll get out of me.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.238
Now listen, soldier. You
ever seen a burial at sea?

10:55.615 --> 10:57.283
Well, you're dressed for one.

10:57.867 --> 11:01.120
Only we're not over the sea. We're
over land, and about a mile up.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.621
It's a long way up, Sergeant.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.166
What these warriors are
trying to say, Sergeant...

11:05.249 --> 11:08.711
...is that if you know anything about
running this thing, you can stay.

11:08.878 --> 11:10.671
Otherwise...

11:13.341 --> 11:14.342
I can work it.

11:15.426 --> 11:18.220
Do you mean you can bring
this thing down when you like?

11:18.387 --> 11:21.640
I can bring you down,
but not necessarily alive.

11:22.266 --> 11:26.687
The way this wind is running, we'll
smash to a pulp when we hit land.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.231
You offering parole?

11:29.523 --> 11:31.108
That's all, rebel.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.862
All right, then. Now hear my terms.

11:35.905 --> 11:38.240
This gale is blowing due west.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.786
Now, maybe we could come down
in your lines, and maybe in mine.

11:42.036 --> 11:45.873
Whichever it is, nobody is anybody's
prisoner when we touch land.

11:46.165 --> 11:47.374
Do you understand?

11:47.458 --> 11:50.628
We all go our own way, and
we don't discuss politics.

11:51.212 --> 11:57.510
Otherwise, Yankees, you can just let
this gale blow you to kingdom come.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.431
All right, cut him loose.

12:03.015 --> 12:05.101
Congratulations, Captain.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.943
<i>This was just the beginning.</i>

12:14.443 --> 12:19.115
<i>We escaped, but only into the clutches
of the greatest storm in American history.</i>

12:20.116 --> 12:24.245
<i>Below us, when we could still see
through the patches of angry clouds...</i>

12:24.745 --> 12:29.416
<i>...were smashed cities and
forests torn up by their roots.</i>

12:31.752 --> 12:34.380
<i>Then finally, the Earth
disappeared from our view.</i>

12:35.047 --> 12:39.593
<i>We were prisoners of the wind,
helpless in the storm's mighty grip.</i>

12:40.386 --> 12:44.306
<i>And we wondered how much
longer would we remain aloft?</i>

12:45.266 --> 12:48.227
<i>Would we ever set foot on the Earth again?</i>

13:04.577 --> 13:06.036
Hey, Captain...

13:06.328 --> 13:08.664
Westward, Neb, still westward.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.292
It's been four days.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.511
Hey, looks like water.

14:06.347 --> 14:08.140
It could be a lake.

14:08.349 --> 14:10.351
Well, it's too big to be a river.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.187
It's too big for either.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.981
Must be the ocean.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.818
Pencroft, take us down and
we'll have a closer look.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.593
It can't be the Pacific.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.553
It can't be anything else.

14:46.845 --> 14:49.515
You mean we've been carried
clear across America?

14:49.723 --> 14:50.891
It looks like it.

14:51.183 --> 14:54.103
Captain, aren't we coming down awfully fast?

14:54.728 --> 14:56.814
Pencroft, close the valve.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.071
It's stuck!

15:07.991 --> 15:10.119
We're going to hit the water and drown!

15:10.202 --> 15:12.204
Can't you do something?

15:12.621 --> 15:15.874
Get your hands off that rope!
It's caught across the opening.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.584
Someone's got to get up there!

15:17.668 --> 15:20.129
- I'm going up.
- No! Lighten the balloon.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.047
Chuck out the rest of the sandbags.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.844
Hurry, Captain. Hurry!

15:32.349 --> 15:34.143
The valve, Captain!

15:38.480 --> 15:40.440
Turn that valve, Captain!

15:50.284 --> 15:51.743
Harder!

15:54.371 --> 15:56.331
No, not that way!

15:56.915 --> 15:57.958
No!

16:16.351 --> 16:20.606
Thank you, Pencroft. I'm glad
I decided to let you stay.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.817
Not you, Captain. It's this
valve bar you broke off.

16:24.026 --> 16:27.112
- Hey, we're not dropping anymore.
- No, I got it closed.

16:27.279 --> 16:30.741
You closed it permanently.
We can't get down anymore.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.118
This was the only control we had.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.720
Captain, the balloon, it's tearing open.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.432
Everything! Throw out everything!

17:37.933 --> 17:39.559
Throw out the food, too?

17:39.810 --> 17:41.853
Food, clothes, everything loose.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.027
We're still dropping, Mr. Spilett.

17:49.194 --> 17:52.697
I suppose you'll want us to
volunteer to go over the side next.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.284
Listen!

17:58.286 --> 18:00.956
It sounds like waves breaking on the shore.

18:01.832 --> 18:02.791
Land!

18:03.041 --> 18:04.251
Where?

18:04.626 --> 18:06.169
Dead ahead, there.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.464
We'll never stay up long enough to get there.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.592
Everybody up on the ring.
Cut the basket loose.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.262
- What for?
- The man's right.

18:15.345 --> 18:19.433
There might be enough gas in the
balloon to keep us afloat on the water.

18:20.892 --> 18:21.935
Come on.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.066
Get up there.

18:28.650 --> 18:29.734
I can't.

18:30.777 --> 18:34.948
Now look, you climb or you
drown, soldier. Now get up there!

18:41.746 --> 18:44.374
All right. Now cut it off at these ropes.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.164
Captain!

19:54.444 --> 19:56.529
- I'm swimming in.
- You'd better not!

19:56.821 --> 19:58.239
That's the way I'm going.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.532
No!

20:27.477 --> 20:31.398
Captain Harding! Captain Harding!

20:33.858 --> 20:37.278
Captain Harding! It's me, Neb.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.759
Did you see anything, Neb?

21:00.427 --> 21:02.137
No. How about you?

21:02.262 --> 21:05.807
Nothing. We went about a mile
beyond where he dropped off.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.476
- Not a sign.
- Maybe he's a bit further up that way.

21:08.601 --> 21:12.856
He'd have to be the best swimmer
in the world to get even this far.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.358
- It won't hurt us to try.
- He's drowned.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.861
You got no right to say that, do you hear me?

21:17.986 --> 21:20.363
Maybe Spilett's seen
something from the rocks.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.243
Oysters, gentlemen?

21:25.368 --> 21:28.121
How come you're not looking
for the Captain, Mr. Spilett?

21:28.204 --> 21:30.290
Because I'm looking for food instead.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.209
Boy, did you ever see
oysters that size before?

21:33.626 --> 21:36.254
- It's almost supernatural, isn't it?
- Look at him.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.340
He's interested in food while
the Captain is still missing.

21:39.424 --> 21:43.136
Take it easy, Neb. You won't
find him. Not alive, anyway.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.513
I tell you he's drowned.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.565
All right, Sergeant. Help yourself.

21:55.899 --> 21:57.901
There. Get your health back.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.362
- What, just raw like that?
- Sure. Why not?

22:01.779 --> 22:02.780
No, thanks.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.409
Come on, boy. Eat up! Come on!

22:07.619 --> 22:09.162
Hey! Smoke!

22:20.465 --> 22:21.633
Come on.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.900
Captain Harding!

22:46.366 --> 22:49.077
- Hey, Captain, are you all right?
- Yeah.

22:49.535 --> 22:52.830
I knew you were alive,
Captain. Hey, didn't I tell you?

22:52.956 --> 22:54.624
Didn't I tell you?

22:54.916 --> 23:00.588
Neb, Herbert, you're all safe. Good.

23:00.672 --> 23:03.299
Good morning, Captain. We missed you.

23:04.050 --> 23:08.346
We would have found you sooner, Captain,
if you hadn't hidden out in these rocks.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.266
- Didn't you bring me here?
- No, sir. We saw your fire.

23:15.144 --> 23:18.272
I wasn't capable of lighting a
fire even if I'd had any matches.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.358
And I hadn't.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.694
None of us had, either.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.363
I don't remember anything since I went under.

23:25.530 --> 23:29.575
Obviously. Neb, he needs some hot food.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.996
Bring some of those coals, and
I'll cook up a giant oyster stew.

23:35.623 --> 23:39.293
Where do you think this fire came
from if the Captain didn't light it?

23:39.711 --> 23:41.546
Of course he lit it somehow.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.424
He just doesn't remember, that's all.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.643
One giant oyster stew special, coming up.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.231
- It smells good.
- It is, son.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.817
Don't touch that, Captain.
It's the seasoning.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.027
- What is it?
- Seaweed.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.573
Captain, any idea where we are?

24:09.198 --> 24:10.283
No.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.411
That wind must have taken
us thousands of miles.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.331
- Fiji, maybe.
- Or New Zealand. Anywhere.

24:17.874 --> 24:22.462
Anywhere? On the other hand,
could be nowhere. Eh, Captain?

24:28.759 --> 24:31.471
Gentlemen, we're going to climb that.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.559
What for, Captain, the exercise?

24:37.185 --> 24:39.020
No, for survival, Mr. Spilett.

24:39.353 --> 24:42.982
From up there, we might be able to
see where we are and how to escape.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.485
Escape to where this time?

24:47.487 --> 24:52.033
And on the way, we'll hunt and
forage. We need meat and vegetables.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.577
And how will we kill the game?

24:54.911 --> 24:57.205
You threw our only guns away.

24:57.955 --> 24:59.540
- Herbert?
- Yes, sir?

25:00.625 --> 25:03.836
- Have you still got your knife?
- Yes, sir.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.507
Good. Then you and Neb will be spear-makers.

25:07.757 --> 25:10.968
Pencroft, you'll be the vegetable-finder.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.679
I'm in the Confederate Army, not yours.

25:14.096 --> 25:17.683
The arrangement was, once we landed,
I stopped being your prisoner.

25:17.934 --> 25:20.186
The agreement was we'd go our own ways.

25:20.978 --> 25:24.857
Either you come my way, under my
command, or you can fend for yourself.

25:27.318 --> 25:28.361
All right.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.113
- I'll find vegetables.
- Good.

25:32.323 --> 25:37.036
And don't try and eat any of the food
you find until our cook has tasted it.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.456
And who is ''our cook''?

25:41.415 --> 25:42.792
You are.

25:45.419 --> 25:46.754
I'm a civilian.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.258
I don't have to take orders from
you, whatever army you're in.

25:50.383 --> 25:54.053
That's legally correct, Mr. Spilett,
but I was under the impression...

25:54.220 --> 25:56.138
...that you'd joined my command.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.933
Joined? I was drafted.

25:59.892 --> 26:04.230
Captain, why don't we turn this island
into a democracy and elect a leader?

26:04.397 --> 26:08.317
One who won't keep escaping to
places which need escaping from.

26:09.110 --> 26:13.656
Because all of us here are still at war,
and I happen to be the ranking officer.

26:13.781 --> 26:16.951
Still at war! All right, I'll cook.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.414
I thought you would, Mr. Spilett.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.666
I'm the butcher man. I'll keep you busy.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.002
Hey, take it easy.

26:28.004 --> 26:31.674
<i>The landscape everywhere was a mixture
of the strange and the beautiful.</i>

26:31.966 --> 26:35.720
<i>Volcanoes surrounded by
tropical palms and sandy beaches.</i>

26:36.262 --> 26:39.390
<i>A riot of wonderful hues
and fantastic colours.</i>

26:40.349 --> 26:43.436
<i>And except for that fire
we found on the first day...</i>

26:43.519 --> 26:47.773
<i>...there was no evidence that
man had ever set foot here before.</i>

26:56.282 --> 27:01.912
<i>We saw birds, and many overgrown plants,
as if patches of nature had gone wild.</i>

27:08.127 --> 27:10.546
<i>Ýt was a rugged trek upwards.</i>

27:10.629 --> 27:13.549
<i>Our physical condition
caused us to tire readily...</i>

27:13.632 --> 27:15.843
<i>...and we were never sure of our footing.</i>

28:09.438 --> 28:12.566
<i>Then finally we came to the
shore of what must have been...</i>

28:12.650 --> 28:14.527
<i>...the other side of the island.</i>

28:31.794 --> 28:33.546
So help me, whales.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.177
Those aren't whales. They're geysers.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.558
Now we know where we can get a hot bath.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.854
All right, gentlemen, we'll
make this our rendezvous.

28:51.146 --> 28:54.817
Now, Mr. Spilett, I'll take Neb.
You take Pencroft and Herbert.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.485
Take them where, Captain?

28:56.944 --> 28:58.654
To hunt for food.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.155
Neb.

29:03.993 --> 29:06.787
The animals will wait. Let's take a swim.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.623
Come on, Pencroft.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.701
Help me! Help me!

29:54.710 --> 29:56.170
Get down here!

29:59.173 --> 30:00.883
You almost got him.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.854
Don't let him get away!
Pencroft, the rope. Come on!

30:22.446 --> 30:23.697
Come on!

30:28.660 --> 30:30.037
Pull it!

30:30.954 --> 30:32.289
I'll get him.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.632
Here, get hold of this.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.522
Don't let him get away!

31:12.955 --> 31:14.498
Hang on, Pencroft!

31:14.790 --> 31:16.833
Try and turn it over on its back.

31:35.352 --> 31:38.522
Look after him, Spilett!
Try and get it over the edge!

31:41.066 --> 31:42.401
Heave!

32:00.627 --> 32:03.005
That's the best crab I ever cooked.

32:03.839 --> 32:07.926
We'd be more impressed, Mr. Spilett,
if you'd put it in the pot by yourself.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.438
Dance!

32:24.192 --> 32:26.486
Scoot in there. That a boy.

32:38.832 --> 32:40.542
That's a mighty big crab.

32:41.752 --> 32:44.296
Captain, how do you suppose
it ever got that big?

32:44.379 --> 32:47.924
- I'd like to know myself.
- From eating the giant oysters obviously.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.553
- I guess I didn't help you much with it.
- You did all right, son.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.555
No, I was scared.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.433
It was the same with getting in the balloon.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.435
I couldn't move until I was shot at.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.188
One shot, and my mind was made up, too.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.232
You don't understand.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.527
I ran away from a battle.
I've been running ever since.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.155
I got caught running away.

33:10.906 --> 33:14.993
Son, your whole Union Army's
been running from mine...

33:15.160 --> 33:16.745
...for the last three years.

33:16.912 --> 33:20.749
Now we're running away from you.
You needn't feel special about it.

33:20.916 --> 33:24.669
All right. We want to reach
that crater before nightfall.

34:33.612 --> 34:36.866
Just once more around to the
top, Captain. Not too far.

34:37.324 --> 34:38.784
Too far for me.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.914
Oh, for the energy of youth.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.626
Let's try a shortcut. Give me the rope.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.129
You mean you're going to lasso that, Captain?

34:49.337 --> 34:51.880
Mr. Harding, permit me.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.260
With pleasure, Mr. Spilett.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.685
Don't you think you ought to stick
to newspaper writing, Mr. Spilett?

35:08.440 --> 35:10.150
Hey!

35:10.483 --> 35:14.321
I'm surprised you're so handy
with a rope, Mr. Spilett.

35:14.404 --> 35:16.698
Now, you just watch a
good balloonist climb one.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.285
You just watch a gentleman.

35:29.919 --> 35:31.671
Hey, he's doing it.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.134
Good morning.

35:37.594 --> 35:40.513
Look what we've got up here, giant mice.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.893
There are some more.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.898
Come on, Spilett. We're going
to try and catch some goat.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.984
Get up! Get up there!

36:19.302 --> 36:21.596
We can build a corral
for these and keep them.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.224
Yeah, there's nothing like
cheese made from goat milk.

36:24.349 --> 36:27.393
- Would you like that, Captain?
- Very nice, Neb.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.979
Hey, Captain, can you
see anything over there?

36:30.105 --> 36:33.274
This is an island all right.
Nothing but water all around.

36:33.566 --> 36:36.569
Hardly more than a volcano
pushed its way up out of the sea.

36:36.820 --> 36:37.862
Harding!

36:38.113 --> 36:39.697
- Harding!
- What?

36:40.115 --> 36:43.660
Look out there. It's a small boat.

36:44.077 --> 36:45.537
It must be.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.791
- It seems to be only drifting.
- Maybe we could use it to get away.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.351
She's beautiful.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.104
Better than that, she's alive.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.786
- How about this one, Captain?
- Yeah, she's alive, too.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.505
Well, here's one that isn't.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.397
Thank you.

37:58.568 --> 37:59.736
I'm sorry.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.112
Thank you.

38:06.659 --> 38:08.661
Will you have some of my soup, madam?

38:09.037 --> 38:10.538
No, thank you.

38:11.706 --> 38:12.957
Are you English?

38:13.207 --> 38:16.878
No, ma'am. We're not
English. We're Americans.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.297
It's made of shellfish.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.966
A kind of French bouillabaisse.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.344
There's only one kind of bouillabaisse.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.513
- Auntie, you must have something.
- Leave me alone, child.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.058
- Are you in charge?
- Yes, ma'am.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.311
I take it that we're not in Marseilles...

38:33.394 --> 38:36.022
...in spite of what the
gentleman offered us to eat.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.525
No, ma'am. We're somewhere in the Pacific.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.028
On an island, to be exact.

38:44.530 --> 38:47.700
But surely you weren't on our ship.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.827
We came by balloon.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.330
I beg your pardon?

38:52.789 --> 38:54.040
I said, we came by-

38:54.123 --> 38:57.251
Please don't talk nonsense.
I shall address myself to you.

38:57.627 --> 38:59.003
But he's right, ma'am.

38:59.087 --> 39:03.591
We were held in a Confederate prison and
escaped in one of their observation balloons.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.134
Yes, I'm quite sure of it.

39:05.218 --> 39:08.596
But we can't possibly stay
here. How soon may we leave?

39:12.392 --> 39:14.018
I'm not quite sure, ma'am.

39:14.310 --> 39:19.023
My name is Lady Mary Fairchild.

39:19.232 --> 39:20.817
And this is my niece, Elena.

39:20.942 --> 39:25.696
Ma'am. My name is Cyrus Harding. Captain
in the United States Army Engineers.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.949
I take it you've met these others.

39:31.285 --> 39:34.705
But where's the sailor who was on our boat?

39:35.415 --> 39:38.167
I'm sorry to have to tell
you, ma'am, that he's dead.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.754
I see now.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.717
Then how soon do you propose to leave?

39:47.135 --> 39:48.845
Just as soon as we build a boat.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.180
I hope it will be soon.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.433
We were travelling home from Valparaiso.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.937
My brother, who is Elena's
father, is British consul in Chile.

39:58.187 --> 40:02.108
He didn't want her to make this voyage,
but I promised him she would be safe.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.905
- How are you, my dear?
- I'm much better, thank you, Auntie.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.491
But I think we're both a
little tired, don't you?

40:10.575 --> 40:12.994
Yes, of course.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.788
So if you will excuse us, gentlemen.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.793
All right, gentlemen.

40:30.511 --> 40:31.762
Gentlemen...

40:32.346 --> 40:34.181
...we'll sleep out here.

40:34.599 --> 40:37.935
Each of us will take a two-hour
watch on guard. I'll stand first.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.729
- Neb, you next.
- Yes, sir.

40:39.896 --> 40:44.066
Tomorrow we'll find timber for the boat.
One of us will stay here with the women.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.568
I'll stay.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.737
I thought you'd volunteer for that.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.281
- Neb, you'll stay.
- Yes, sir.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.744
This is magnificent country.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.997
A man could write an inspired
novel in a place like this.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.959
Looks like a good stand of timber up there.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.004
Supply of fresh water down here.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.090
Pencroft, fill the cask.

41:49.298 --> 41:50.633
Now look, I'm not...

41:52.635 --> 41:53.636
Yes, sir.

41:57.098 --> 42:01.018
Maybe we ought to move over to this
side of the island permanently, Captain.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.898
You read my mind, Herbert.

42:06.232 --> 42:09.527
I think we ought to take a look
down here on the beach first...

42:09.819 --> 42:13.572
...to see if there's a good place
where we can build and launch the boat.

42:24.667 --> 42:28.337
How do you expect to cut down
trees this size with a stone axe?

42:29.255 --> 42:31.549
By putting our backs into it, Mr. Spilett.

42:53.446 --> 42:55.406
What a spooky place this is.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.491
Looks like someone hung down ropes.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.160
No, those are vine creepers.

42:59.452 --> 43:02.538
They might have been hung
there all the same, to climb up.

43:02.746 --> 43:06.500
- Who'd want to climb up there?
- Who saved the Captain? Who built his fire?

43:06.834 --> 43:10.296
- Maybe it grew there naturally.
- Vines don't grow out of solid rock.

43:10.462 --> 43:12.882
Feels strong enough to take a man's weight.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.551
Now, you stay down here. I'll take a look.

46:05.387 --> 46:09.308
''And so I have decided that a life
such as this is no longer worth living.

46:10.559 --> 46:14.730
''I therefore bequeath all my
worldly possessions to whosoever...

46:14.813 --> 46:16.815
''...shall discover my remains.

46:17.357 --> 46:21.403
''A curse upon the brigands who have
abandoned me to suffer and to die.''

46:22.362 --> 46:27.743
Signed, ''Thomas Ayrton. August 13, 1862.''

46:28.577 --> 46:32.206
I'd trade all his worldly
possessions for one good axe.

46:33.207 --> 46:35.167
I wonder why he never drank this up.

46:35.375 --> 46:37.211
Probably was a teetotaller.

46:37.502 --> 46:39.796
It tastes... It smells mighty good.

46:39.922 --> 46:42.007
If you're looking for a story to write...

46:42.090 --> 46:44.968
...there's a great one in that
diary for you, Mr. Spilett.

46:45.052 --> 46:47.804
You know, Herbert, you're right.

46:49.473 --> 46:54.102
Thomas Ayrton, honest seaman, falls
in with a gang of cutthroat pirates...

46:54.436 --> 46:57.898
...and is cast away by them
on this mysterious island...

46:58.148 --> 47:01.443
...with his tongue cut out so
he won't reveal their secrets.

47:02.277 --> 47:04.905
Alone, he degenerates into animal savagery...

47:04.988 --> 47:07.532
...and finally, disgusted
with his bestiality...

47:07.616 --> 47:09.826
...insane with hunger for the human company-

47:09.910 --> 47:14.039
Just a minute now, Mr. Spilett.
Isn't all that just a little flowery?

47:14.206 --> 47:17.042
That's what the reading public wants today.

47:17.209 --> 47:20.504
He hangs himself from the
rafters of a prehistoric cave.

47:21.129 --> 47:23.507
The death of an ex-pirate.

47:23.590 --> 47:26.134
''Yo-ho-ho, and
a bottle of rum!''

47:26.259 --> 47:28.178
What's wrong with you?

47:28.261 --> 47:30.347
Up the Jolly Roger!

47:30.597 --> 47:35.602
''Fifteen men on a dead man's chest''

47:36.478 --> 47:38.230
He's been swizzling this stuff.

47:38.355 --> 47:41.650
This is our place, and everything in it.

47:43.402 --> 47:44.987
Says so in his diary.

47:47.030 --> 47:49.074
That's quite true, Pencroft.

47:50.659 --> 47:51.910
This is ideal.

47:55.539 --> 47:58.875
Perfect shelter, perfect safety.

47:59.918 --> 48:03.755
And a fine place from which to carry
out our boat building operations.

48:03.964 --> 48:07.217
And, if I may say so, gentlemen...

48:08.301 --> 48:10.804
...solid as a rock.

48:14.433 --> 48:17.310
<i>We called our new place
''The Granite House.''</i>

48:17.644 --> 48:20.480
<i>And our proudest achievement
was the construction...</i>

48:20.647 --> 48:23.608
<i>...of a homemade elevator.
A real engineering feat.</i>

48:24.901 --> 48:28.822
<i>Ýt made it easier for us to bring
in whatever provisions we could find.</i>

48:29.030 --> 48:32.367
<i>We attempted to equip the place
with as many modern conveniences...</i>

48:32.451 --> 48:33.827
<i>...as we knew how.</i>

48:40.667 --> 48:43.754
<i>The women added a few
welcomed, feminine touches...</i>

48:43.920 --> 48:45.881
<i>...which turned the cave into a home...</i>

48:46.047 --> 48:48.675
<i>...while we went off to
attend to the other work.</i>

48:50.552 --> 48:54.097
<i>There was timber to cut, and
the boat which had to be built.</i>

48:55.140 --> 48:56.725
<i>None of it was easy.</i>

48:57.267 --> 49:00.479
<i>We lived like primitive men,
using primitive implements.</i>

49:01.188 --> 49:04.191
<i>But ingenuity and hard work
were our most valuable tools...</i>

49:04.357 --> 49:06.026
<i>...in our struggle to survive.</i>

49:11.031 --> 49:13.575
<i>One tree down, but it took us days.</i>

49:14.534 --> 49:17.913
<i>And whatever we did accomplish,
we still lacked many things...</i>

49:18.079 --> 49:20.081
<i>...that would make life bearable.</i>

49:20.415 --> 49:25.420
<i>And then, one afternoon, Neb found
something at the water's edge.</i>

49:30.550 --> 49:33.261
Captain, these knots
are tied sailor-fashion.

49:34.971 --> 49:35.680
Hey!

49:35.847 --> 49:38.391
- Look at that!
- Captain, rifles!

49:38.600 --> 49:41.144
Breach loaders and ammunition!

49:41.520 --> 49:43.772
Hey, Captain, what's in this box?

49:44.523 --> 49:46.608
It's a compass, charts...

49:48.276 --> 49:51.780
...and a sextant! We'll be
able to find out where we are.

49:52.030 --> 49:54.407
There are hammers, saws, nails.

49:54.532 --> 49:57.285
Hey, ladies, look at this.
Plenty of pots and pans.

49:58.411 --> 50:01.790
Also a looking glass. And hairpins.

50:02.040 --> 50:05.669
Hey, a telescope! Man, there's
nothing this chest ain't got.

50:05.794 --> 50:08.338
Whoever packed this
certainly knew what we needed.

50:08.505 --> 50:11.049
And exactly what we ought to read.

50:13.134 --> 50:15.971
<i>''The Life and Adventures
of Robinson Crusoe.''</i>

50:24.271 --> 50:25.230
Sorry.

50:25.313 --> 50:27.691
It's mighty nice of you
to do this for me, Elena.

50:27.774 --> 50:30.443
I intend to do it for all
of you. It's part of my job.

50:30.527 --> 50:32.112
Captain Harding's order.

50:34.114 --> 50:35.365
Front, please.

50:39.786 --> 50:41.037
Mr. Spilett...

50:44.374 --> 50:45.333
Thank you.

50:45.417 --> 50:48.586
A few of the comforts of
civilization make life quite bearable.

50:48.712 --> 50:51.548
That depends on how many
comforts one's been used to.

50:51.631 --> 50:54.175
I'd say you'd never done
yourself badly, ma'am.

50:54.384 --> 50:56.678
Why should I? But don't let that mislead you.

50:56.845 --> 51:01.141
I'm the best shot in the county, and I
think I could outride you at any time.

51:01.307 --> 51:03.768
Probably outdrink you as well.

51:03.852 --> 51:06.980
That's something we must put to
the test at a later date, ma'am.

51:07.063 --> 51:09.566
At the moment, my main
comfort is your presence.

51:09.733 --> 51:12.652
I'm not in much of a hurry
to leave this island now.

51:12.777 --> 51:15.113
Well, I'm delighted to
have met you, Mr. Spilett.

51:15.238 --> 51:18.491
I'd be even more delighted
if I knew where we were.

51:19.075 --> 51:23.913
- Have you finished your calculations?
- Yes, ma'am. We're here.

51:24.497 --> 51:27.375
36 degrees south, 153 degrees west.

51:27.792 --> 51:29.461
How interesting.

51:30.044 --> 51:33.715
Now I shall be able to say to my
friends, ''Do you know Mr. Spilett?

51:33.882 --> 51:37.719
''We ran into each other 36
degrees south, 150 degrees west.''

51:38.178 --> 51:41.055
So much more intriguing
than the usual places.

51:42.056 --> 51:45.226
And of course, this large
body of land is New Zealand.

51:45.518 --> 51:48.646
New Zealand! How convenient.

51:48.772 --> 51:52.275
I have a cousin twice removed, he
serves in the Colonial Office there.

51:52.484 --> 51:53.610
Really?

51:53.693 --> 51:57.280
In that case, ma'am, you'll be
delighted to know that you're only...

51:57.489 --> 52:01.367
...one thousand eight hundred and...

52:01.451 --> 52:05.538
...seventy-three miles away from him.

52:07.332 --> 52:11.503
You work too hard, Captain.
Harder than any of us.

52:12.921 --> 52:14.964
Don't you ever think of anything else?

52:15.882 --> 52:19.302
I will, ma'am, as soon
as we get off this island.

52:20.595 --> 52:25.058
Lady Mary, do you think that sea chest
could have come from your shipwreck?

52:25.308 --> 52:28.811
I don't think so. Nobody had
any time to pack anything.

52:30.355 --> 52:32.899
Captain, you seen this lettering?

52:36.277 --> 52:38.821
''N-A-U...''

52:40.698 --> 52:41.533
<i>Nautilus!</i>

52:42.033 --> 52:43.785
Here, let me see that.

52:47.664 --> 52:49.999
<i>You're right. It must be from the Nautilus.</i>

52:50.625 --> 52:53.545
- You mean the submarine?
- Captain Nemo's ship.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.421
What a story that was.

52:55.547 --> 52:58.091
- Do you remember, Lady Mary?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

52:58.174 --> 53:00.343
Possibly it was during the hunting season.

53:00.677 --> 53:03.429
It made the headlines in New
York and London for weeks.

53:03.555 --> 53:05.932
This Nemo, with his...

53:06.849 --> 53:08.851
...''submarine,'' did you call it?

53:10.228 --> 53:12.522
Was he a man of some notoriety?

53:12.772 --> 53:14.899
He was a monster, a devil.

53:15.024 --> 53:17.568
What do you mean, he was
a devil? He was a genius.

53:17.694 --> 53:20.029
Any man who could live
under water like a fish-

53:20.113 --> 53:22.532
- Under what?
- Under water, ma'am.

53:22.615 --> 53:26.369
This submarine was powered with some
incredible method he'd invented himself.

53:26.744 --> 53:28.997
Nothing on the surface could escape from it.

53:29.163 --> 53:30.915
Precisely, Mr. Spilett.

53:31.082 --> 53:33.543
And he used it to destroy
ships without warning.

53:33.710 --> 53:35.753
Only warships, Captain.

53:36.170 --> 53:40.675
He had a kink about war, Lady Mary.
A very sensible kink. He hated it.

53:41.926 --> 53:45.096
Captain, what language is this?

53:48.391 --> 53:53.730
<i>It's Latin. ''Mihi libertas necessest.''</i>

53:55.106 --> 53:57.025
''I must have liberty.''

54:01.487 --> 54:03.406
Did he find it, Mr. Spilett?

54:03.698 --> 54:06.743
His submarine was reported
lost off the coast of Mexico...

54:06.826 --> 54:09.495
...about eight years ago with all hands.

54:12.206 --> 54:15.835
This chest has been floating
in the sea for eight years.

54:16.335 --> 54:18.713
Do you really believe it has, Captain?

54:49.702 --> 54:51.162
I'm tired.

54:52.079 --> 54:54.165
At your age? Ridiculous!

54:54.832 --> 54:56.626
I'm tired of working.

54:56.709 --> 55:00.171
What do you want, a servant? So do I.

55:00.338 --> 55:02.715
If you find one, send her to me.

55:02.924 --> 55:04.842
The next you can keep for yourself.

55:05.009 --> 55:08.221
But in the meantime, we'll
go on working like the others.

55:09.096 --> 55:12.433
Mr. Spilett thinks we've been
overworked, too. He's gone fishing.

55:12.850 --> 55:13.851
He has?

55:16.729 --> 55:19.524
We better hope that Captain
Harding doesn't find out.

55:54.058 --> 55:57.186
Mary, run! Run!

56:07.655 --> 56:08.781
Help!

56:20.001 --> 56:21.377
Hey, Neb, hold it.

58:00.935 --> 58:02.478
Come on, Pencroft!

58:02.728 --> 58:06.190
- I'll get him.
- No, wait, not here! You'll hit Herbert.

58:17.409 --> 58:18.953
Are you all right?

58:27.336 --> 58:30.923
I wonder how many minutes it
would take to cook in a slow oven.

58:39.890 --> 58:41.517
Boy, it cuts like butter.

58:41.684 --> 58:43.936
It tastes delicious, too.

58:44.019 --> 58:48.190
I guess yesterday this bird would have
said the same thing about you, Mr. Spilett.

58:50.526 --> 58:52.319
What's the matter?

58:52.570 --> 58:57.032
It might not have swallowed you, Mr.
Spilett, but it sure enough ate rocks.

58:57.491 --> 58:59.869
- That doesn't look like a rock.
- No, it isn't.

59:00.202 --> 59:01.579
That's a bullet.

59:02.538 --> 59:04.832
None of us fired a shot at the bird.

59:05.040 --> 59:08.252
No, I tried but the gun jammed.

59:08.961 --> 59:10.879
This is what killed it, all the same.

59:10.963 --> 59:14.049
- We'd have heard a shot, wouldn't we?
- Not necessarily.

59:14.717 --> 59:17.720
It might've happened when the
bird crashed through the fence.

59:17.845 --> 59:19.972
I might have figured it wasn't my knife.

59:20.055 --> 59:22.766
It didn't feel right, the
way the bird fell under me.

59:23.017 --> 59:26.604
You risked your life for me,
Herbert, and I'll never forget that.

59:26.770 --> 59:28.939
Yes, that's right, Herbert.

59:29.148 --> 59:32.693
Had it not been for you, Mr. Spilett
would still be on the inside...

59:32.818 --> 59:36.030
...cutting out, instead of on
the outside cutting in, huh?

59:38.365 --> 59:41.827
<i>Lady Mary turned out to be quite
handy with a needle and thread.</i>

59:42.077 --> 59:45.164
<i>She was able to make goatskins
into clothing for the men...</i>

59:45.331 --> 59:47.708
<i>...and fashioned a trim garment for Elena.</i>

59:48.292 --> 59:53.756
I don't know how I let you talk me into it.
Everyone's going to say it's far too short.

59:55.215 --> 59:57.676
- Herbert won't.
- I'm certain he won't.

59:59.303 --> 01:00:00.804
Come here.

01:00:01.805 --> 01:00:04.683
I've decided to marry him.

01:00:05.684 --> 01:00:07.186
And what has he decided?

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:11.106
Don't sound so surprised. My mother
was already married by my age.

01:00:11.398 --> 01:00:13.400
That was on the Continent.

01:00:14.568 --> 01:00:17.571
But don't you realise that we
may never get off this island?

01:00:17.738 --> 01:00:19.406
Then you'll have time to wait.

01:00:19.531 --> 01:00:22.034
- But Herbert doesn't want to wait.
- Doesn't he?

01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:25.162
- And neither do I.
- I'm afraid you'll have to.

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:27.873
Go off and tend to your goats.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:54.108
I'm going to ask Captain Harding to marry us.

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.362
That'd be wonderful, if he were
only a minister, but he's not.

01:00:58.737 --> 01:01:02.366
He's a captain, and captains
can marry people at sea.

01:01:03.742 --> 01:01:06.036
He's a land captain, not a sea captain.

01:01:06.286 --> 01:01:08.288
Well, we're on land, aren't we?

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:17.339
Herbert.

01:01:18.006 --> 01:01:20.801
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:22.845
It looks like honey.

01:01:26.765 --> 01:01:27.766
It is honey.

01:01:28.225 --> 01:01:30.310
Did you ever visit a beehive?

01:02:06.388 --> 01:02:07.639
It's a honeycomb.

01:02:07.764 --> 01:02:11.268
- It can't be. It's too big.
- It can't be anything else.

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:15.314
Let's go get some seashells, and
we'll take some back for the others.

01:02:53.185 --> 01:02:54.936
Come on!

01:03:00.275 --> 01:03:01.902
Get in the honeycomb!

01:03:43.193 --> 01:03:44.528
What's it doing?

01:03:44.861 --> 01:03:46.363
I don't know.

01:03:59.584 --> 01:04:01.086
It's sealing us in.

01:04:12.222 --> 01:04:16.143
- Hey, Captain. A sail!
- We're going to be saved!

01:04:17.018 --> 01:04:18.770
They're right. Look.

01:04:18.979 --> 01:04:21.231
Captain, shall we light the signal fires now?

01:04:21.356 --> 01:04:23.358
- Yeah, come on!
- Hold it!

01:04:23.608 --> 01:04:26.403
We'll take a look at it
through the telescope first.

01:04:26.486 --> 01:04:29.281
What's the matter, don't
you want to be saved?

01:04:29.364 --> 01:04:32.367
It's coming this way,
whatever we do. Let's go!

01:04:33.451 --> 01:04:35.453
Come on, get up to Granite House.

01:04:49.467 --> 01:04:50.635
Hand me some more.

01:04:50.927 --> 01:04:51.887
What for?

01:04:53.805 --> 01:04:56.266
From the sea chest,
remember? I took these out.

01:05:32.177 --> 01:05:33.970
It's heavily armed.

01:05:36.473 --> 01:05:38.767
And it's flying the skull and crossbones.

01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:42.103
Do you think it's the same pirates
Ayrton wrote about in his diary?

01:05:42.187 --> 01:05:45.273
It's the same ones who cut out
his tongue and left him to die.

01:05:45.357 --> 01:05:47.901
We wouldn't get much mercy
from them if they find us.

01:05:47.984 --> 01:05:50.320
You two get on the beach
and camouflage the boat.

01:05:50.403 --> 01:05:52.947
When you come back, get
this inside and out of sight.

01:05:53.073 --> 01:05:54.824
Spilett, stack the ammunition.

01:05:56.409 --> 01:05:59.037
Elena's out there with
Herbert. We must get them back.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:03.792
Don't worry. He's a soldier. If he sees a
gang of armed cutthroats, he'll take cover.

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:06.211
We're going to load and stack the rifles.

01:06:30.735 --> 01:06:31.736
Elena!

01:06:37.575 --> 01:06:38.952
Elena, are you all right?

01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:46.126
What is it?

01:06:47.252 --> 01:06:48.753
It's some kind of ship.

01:06:50.004 --> 01:06:52.132
I've never seen anything like it before.

01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:54.259
Come on, let's get on it.

01:07:52.442 --> 01:07:53.651
Hello!

01:07:57.947 --> 01:07:59.657
Is anybody there?

01:08:02.493 --> 01:08:04.037
Come on.

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:16.591
Hello.

01:08:17.675 --> 01:08:18.926
Anybody there?

01:08:42.908 --> 01:08:44.118
Let's take a look.

01:08:44.202 --> 01:08:46.245
- No, we'd better not.
- Come on.

01:08:48.122 --> 01:08:51.792
<i>Herbert, didn't Mr. Spilett say the
Nautilus was sunk eight years ago...</i>

01:08:51.876 --> 01:08:53.377
...off the coast of Mexico?

01:08:53.586 --> 01:08:55.004
Yeah, he did.

01:08:55.755 --> 01:08:57.381
Then what is it doing here?

01:08:58.049 --> 01:08:59.133
I don't know.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.317
Herbert! Don't!

01:09:17.484 --> 01:09:18.986
Let's get out of here.

01:09:53.645 --> 01:09:55.565
How do we get out?

01:09:56.482 --> 01:09:57.900
Over there.

01:09:58.067 --> 01:09:59.444
That wasn't there before.

01:09:59.569 --> 01:10:02.613
Maybe the tide came out or
something. Let's swim for it.

01:10:44.572 --> 01:10:45.573
Neb.

01:10:49.994 --> 01:10:52.330
- How many are there?
- Only three.

01:11:02.798 --> 01:11:04.383
They're taking out casks.

01:11:06.177 --> 01:11:08.221
They must be going for water.

01:11:11.515 --> 01:11:12.934
We can take them, Captain.

01:11:13.017 --> 01:11:16.103
And bring all the rest of
them ashore? No, thanks.

01:11:16.437 --> 01:11:18.397
We'll sit this one out quietly.

01:11:27.406 --> 01:11:30.826
- What are they doing now?
- They're going towards the boat.

01:11:31.369 --> 01:11:33.621
- Do you think they'll find it?
- I don't know.

01:11:43.422 --> 01:11:45.299
Lady Mary, another rifle.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.759
Yes, sir.

01:13:40.706 --> 01:13:43.792
Hey, Captain, look! It's sinking.

01:13:44.084 --> 01:13:46.754
- What do you suppose happened?
- I don't know.

01:13:46.962 --> 01:13:48.964
Something must have blown up on her.

01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:57.598
Come on! We better get back fast.

01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:25.459
Run, Elena.

01:14:48.399 --> 01:14:49.942
Put that down.

01:14:53.529 --> 01:14:55.155
All right, we'll split up.

01:14:55.364 --> 01:14:58.784
Spilett, you take the west
side. Neb, you go inland.

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:06.291
Very well, soldier.

01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:10.462
Hang on to it if it gives you
comfort. Just don't throw it.

01:15:23.017 --> 01:15:24.810
How do you do, Captain Harding?

01:15:25.561 --> 01:15:26.895
I am Captain Nemo.

01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:28.981
Nemo?

01:15:30.274 --> 01:15:32.735
How did you know my name? Did you tell him?

01:15:32.901 --> 01:15:34.737
It wasn't necessary.

01:15:35.195 --> 01:15:39.908
I've known about you all for months,
now, from the day I carried you ashore.

01:15:40.242 --> 01:15:42.369
You were the one who built the fire?

01:15:43.662 --> 01:15:47.332
- The man who fired the mystery bullet.
- Someone had to kill that bird.

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:50.210
Her Ladyship's gun jammed.

01:15:50.335 --> 01:15:53.714
Do join us, Lady Mary. I'm
not quite the ogre I appear.

01:15:54.048 --> 01:15:57.551
Do you usually dress up like
that to frighten young ladies?

01:15:58.218 --> 01:16:01.680
No, not to frighten young
ladies. To breathe under water.

01:16:02.347 --> 01:16:04.808
You see, I do much of my work out there.

01:16:05.017 --> 01:16:06.518
So we've heard.

01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:09.605
Like sinking ships and drowning innocent men.

01:16:09.938 --> 01:16:14.151
Surely you don't object to my
having placed an explosive charge...

01:16:14.318 --> 01:16:16.653
...to that pirate ship to drown them, do you?

01:16:16.737 --> 01:16:19.656
See, Harding, I told you he
was a genius and not a devil.

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:21.909
<i>Captain Nemo, I'm from the New York Herald.</i>

01:16:21.992 --> 01:16:24.661
- I reported your story eight
years ago- -I know you.

01:16:24.745 --> 01:16:29.541
I've read some of your dispatches.
You specialise in war news, don't you?

01:16:29.792 --> 01:16:33.420
You supply the ink. The
soldiers supply the blood.

01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:37.591
- I bet that was his place we just came from.
- Yes.

01:16:38.133 --> 01:16:42.054
There's a big iron ship in a flooded
grotto. Elena and I were just aboard.

01:16:42.596 --> 01:16:45.349
<i>- The Nautilus? Here?
- What's left of it.</i>

01:16:45.557 --> 01:16:48.435
- That means we can get
off- -No, you can't.

01:16:48.519 --> 01:16:53.315
If you hope to use my vessel to leave, don't,
because she can never take to sea again.

01:16:53.482 --> 01:16:55.943
Why have you stayed hidden
from us all this time?

01:16:59.154 --> 01:17:03.242
Because contact with my own
species has always disappointed me.

01:17:04.034 --> 01:17:09.540
Solitude gives me freedom of
mind and independence of action.

01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:14.044
Why have you picked this particular
time to interrupt this solitude?

01:17:14.962 --> 01:17:16.505
I'll tell you.

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:20.717
Because your behaviour,
gentlemen, and ladies...

01:17:20.801 --> 01:17:23.720
...in a struggle for survival,
has been quite admirable.

01:17:24.221 --> 01:17:27.641
Now I am satisfied that I
can use your resourcefulness.

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:32.521
You see, that volcano is
on the verge of eruption.

01:17:38.944 --> 01:17:42.781
A catastrophe of nature will soon
turn this island into cinders.

01:17:43.448 --> 01:17:46.451
In short, Captain Harding,
I need your help...

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:48.620
...as much as you need mine.

01:17:49.121 --> 01:17:51.748
Only you don't have much
choice if you want to live.

01:17:52.416 --> 01:17:56.336
Now you listen to me. We won't do
anything because of your threats.

01:17:56.503 --> 01:17:58.880
We have every intention of going on living.

01:17:59.214 --> 01:18:02.134
If, however, you'd care to
share the boat we're building...

01:18:02.217 --> 01:18:04.177
...I think that might be arranged.

01:18:04.344 --> 01:18:07.431
Thank you, but it wouldn't
be finished in time.

01:18:07.806 --> 01:18:11.727
Also, it would be too small for my needs.

01:18:12.394 --> 01:18:17.274
Fortunately, the ship that will carry us
all into safety is already waiting for us.

01:18:18.817 --> 01:18:19.985
Out there.

01:18:44.051 --> 01:18:45.635
My last bottle.

01:18:46.428 --> 01:18:49.431
Another pressing reason for moving out soon.

01:18:49.931 --> 01:18:54.728
Captain Nemo, if we ever do get off this
island, I'd like to write your life story.

01:18:54.853 --> 01:18:59.983
Yes. Whatever does a man do on an
island like this for eight years?

01:19:00.776 --> 01:19:04.279
It depends on the man. I
did what I've always done...

01:19:04.946 --> 01:19:08.408
...devoted my strength to
destroying the concept of warfare.

01:19:09.284 --> 01:19:11.536
Your profession, Captain Harding.

01:19:13.914 --> 01:19:17.751
Considering the ships and crews
that you've sunk without mercy...

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:20.253
...you can't disturb my conscience.

01:19:20.962 --> 01:19:22.297
Can't I?

01:19:22.798 --> 01:19:24.966
What I did was in the name of peace.

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:31.431
Your war, like all wars,
glories in devastation and death.

01:19:32.516 --> 01:19:34.851
Well, my war will set men free.

01:19:35.644 --> 01:19:38.563
That's a struggle that belongs
to all men, don't you think?

01:19:38.647 --> 01:19:41.900
Just how have you been able to
carry out your crusade, Captain...

01:19:41.983 --> 01:19:45.070
<i>...without the Nautilus in operation?</i>

01:19:45.487 --> 01:19:48.824
A good question, Mr. War Correspondent.

01:19:49.282 --> 01:19:53.537
It will please Captain Harding to know
it did not entail the sinking of warships.

01:19:54.579 --> 01:19:59.334
So instead, I've been conducting
experiments in horticultural physics.

01:19:59.459 --> 01:20:00.877
Horti-what?

01:20:01.002 --> 01:20:06.132
Experiments that will guarantee
mankind an inexhaustible food supply.

01:20:07.467 --> 01:20:10.428
Yes. Surely you've seen the results.

01:20:10.679 --> 01:20:13.223
- Hey, that crab!
- And the honeycomb!

01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:18.770
The giant oysters you devoured.
The bird that almost devoured you.

01:20:20.146 --> 01:20:23.775
<i>With the Nautilus, I was merely
attacking the weapons of war.</i>

01:20:23.984 --> 01:20:29.781
But now I've conquered the causes:
famine and economic competition.

01:20:31.575 --> 01:20:36.955
Imagine, wheat growing 40 feet
high and sheep the size of cattle.

01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:41.960
When I've delivered my designs
and apparatus to the world...

01:20:43.712 --> 01:20:45.505
...my work will be over.

01:20:45.589 --> 01:20:49.009
That's what you meant when you said
our boat wouldn't be big enough.

01:20:49.092 --> 01:20:51.094
- That is right.
- Now look.

01:20:51.219 --> 01:20:54.347
You said that volcano was due
to erupt in the next few days.

01:20:54.848 --> 01:20:56.850
Have we got time to just sit and talk?

01:20:57.767 --> 01:21:01.688
Not really, but I should
like to if you don't mind.

01:21:02.022 --> 01:21:05.650
I want to make it clear to you that
there is more than saving our lives...

01:21:05.734 --> 01:21:07.235
...which interests me.

01:21:07.319 --> 01:21:10.989
I must take the results of
my work back to civilization.

01:21:11.239 --> 01:21:16.244
To do this, I realised I needed a
ship of size, like that pirate vessel.

01:21:16.494 --> 01:21:18.747
And that's why you sent her to the bottom?

01:21:19.414 --> 01:21:23.043
How would you dispose of a crew
of violent men in one stroke?

01:21:23.126 --> 01:21:26.379
Do you actually believe you
can refloat a ship of that size?

01:21:27.505 --> 01:21:31.092
I planted that charge to damage
her only in one small section.

01:21:32.010 --> 01:21:34.721
I have the necessary equipment to raise her.

01:21:35.263 --> 01:21:38.850
And you all will supply the manpower.

01:21:40.727 --> 01:21:43.688
To your very good health. You will need it.

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:48.943
Now, Captain Harding...

01:21:49.903 --> 01:21:53.448
...aren't you ready to
dance with the devil now?

01:21:55.533 --> 01:21:58.870
You show me the pumps and the
power to raise that ship...

01:21:59.454 --> 01:22:02.290
...and then you'll have
seven new waltz partners.

01:22:06.169 --> 01:22:07.545
Very well.

01:22:10.465 --> 01:22:11.508
Have a look.

01:22:29.484 --> 01:22:34.614
This bottle, like a ship, floats
because it is filled with air.

01:22:35.698 --> 01:22:39.369
Now, make a hole in either, as
I did in that pirate vessel...

01:22:40.036 --> 01:22:42.121
...the air is displaced by water...

01:22:43.081 --> 01:22:47.335
...and the bottle, like the
ship, sinks to the bottom.

01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:55.927
Therefore, when we've set a patch
over the damaged section of the hull...

01:22:56.719 --> 01:22:58.513
...we can pipe air into it...

01:22:59.222 --> 01:23:03.268
...through the pipeline,
which we construct from bamboo.

01:23:03.768 --> 01:23:07.480
The pressurised air entering here
drives the water out of the hold...

01:23:07.564 --> 01:23:12.235
...which becomes afloat, and as it does
so, the ship will rise to the surface.

01:23:12.443 --> 01:23:14.904
Fabricating the patch,
bolting it into place...

01:23:15.029 --> 01:23:19.117
...making sure all sections of the hull
are airtight, including the hatchways...

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.828
...are the jobs you will
have to do under water.

01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:24.539
I'll train you and equip you for it.

01:23:24.873 --> 01:23:28.877
- Theoretically, it should work.
- Theoretically, we'll be dead if it doesn't.

01:23:30.587 --> 01:23:34.591
<i>Although Captain Nemo was
confident, Ý was extremely doubtful.</i>

01:23:35.633 --> 01:23:39.637
<i>Nevertheless, under his direction
we cut bamboo for the pipeline.</i>

01:23:40.555 --> 01:23:43.016
<i>Nemo told us where there were rubber trees...</i>

01:23:43.141 --> 01:23:46.436
<i>...and the women gathered the
sap to seal the pipe connections.</i>

01:23:46.644 --> 01:23:49.522
<i>And we laboriously manufactured
a large wooden patch...</i>

01:23:49.731 --> 01:23:51.941
<i>...according to Nemo's specifications.</i>

01:23:52.859 --> 01:23:56.446
<i>We were to use it to repair the
hull of the damaged pirate ship.</i>

01:23:56.821 --> 01:23:59.949
<i>Even Spilett worked hard
on the raft we would need.</i>

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:04.329
<i>Lady Mary and Elena arduously
applied the sealing substance...</i>

01:24:04.621 --> 01:24:06.414
<i>...joining the lengths of bamboo...</i>

01:24:06.497 --> 01:24:09.667
<i>...which had to be stretched
from the Nautilus' engine room...</i>

01:24:09.751 --> 01:24:13.880
<i>...through tortuous rocky areas
to the water's edge and beyond.</i>

01:24:16.299 --> 01:24:19.969
<i>Then Nemo gave us underwater gear
that he kept aboard his submarine.</i>

01:24:20.553 --> 01:24:24.599
<i>The breathing apparatus had been
fabricated out of giant seashells.</i>

01:24:24.682 --> 01:24:28.478
<i>We had to learn how to walk with lead
- weighted shoes on the seabed...</i>

01:24:28.686 --> 01:24:31.397
<i>...and to withstand the
pressures of the water's depth.</i>

01:24:38.738 --> 01:24:42.241
<i>Nemo then showed us the incredible
electric gun he had invented...</i>

01:24:42.325 --> 01:24:45.036
<i>...for protection against
the dangers of the deep.</i>

01:25:21.572 --> 01:25:24.117
<i>By learning to breathe
and walk on the seafloor...</i>

01:25:24.534 --> 01:25:28.579
<i>...Nemo showed us the remains of an
ancient city and a forgotten civilization.</i>

01:25:29.413 --> 01:25:32.500
<i>We could see that once before
a volcano had erupted...</i>

01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:37.672
<i>...decreeing the death of all who are now
entombed in this weird, sunken citadel.</i>

01:26:39.358 --> 01:26:42.028
Herbert, these aren't finished here.

01:26:44.155 --> 01:26:47.783
Well, we ought to be able to
fit the patch tomorrow morning.

01:27:15.394 --> 01:27:17.688
Is that it? Is it starting now?

01:27:24.403 --> 01:27:27.740
I was wrong. There won't be enough time.

01:27:28.449 --> 01:27:30.785
Man, look at it. It's terrifying!

01:27:40.878 --> 01:27:42.963
We've lost the race.

01:27:44.131 --> 01:27:47.343
Still, there is always a
small chance it will subside.

01:27:48.511 --> 01:27:52.264
<i>I suggest we take cover
in the Nautilus and hope.</i>

01:28:18.416 --> 01:28:21.419
When the lava comes, we'll
just be trapped here, won't we?

01:28:21.502 --> 01:28:23.421
How soon will that be?

01:28:25.047 --> 01:28:26.966
Would it really help to know?

01:28:27.883 --> 01:28:31.053
Two hours. Two hours, then.

01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:49.864
Aren't we able to do
anything to save ourselves?

01:28:51.198 --> 01:28:53.075
There's nothing that can be done.

01:28:53.159 --> 01:28:56.996
Is this the infinitely resourceful
genius you told me about?

01:28:57.413 --> 01:29:01.458
A man who says let yourself be trapped
and die without even lifting a finger.

01:29:03.627 --> 01:29:08.048
I don't believe nothing can
be done. I don't believe it!

01:29:09.967 --> 01:29:11.385
Lady Mary...

01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:14.430
...I am a realist.

01:29:18.767 --> 01:29:22.271
Captain Harding, is he right?

01:29:22.813 --> 01:29:26.192
Have we worked so hard and
gone through all this...

01:29:26.275 --> 01:29:28.068
...to be told there's no hope?

01:29:28.152 --> 01:29:31.280
He is like you, a man
of faith, not of reason.

01:29:37.786 --> 01:29:39.163
Captain.

01:29:39.914 --> 01:29:41.749
Captain, come here, please.

01:29:48.756 --> 01:29:50.007
I've got an idea.

01:30:02.019 --> 01:30:03.854
Herbert, now look.

01:30:04.313 --> 01:30:07.566
Say this is the envelope of the
balloon that brought us here.

01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:10.110
It would only take about
half an hour to repair.

01:30:10.194 --> 01:30:12.529
We attach it to the bamboo pipeline.

01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:16.659
Then we place it inside
the hull of the sunken ship.

01:30:17.076 --> 01:30:19.119
It would take, what, another hour.

01:30:19.203 --> 01:30:21.246
<i>Then with the pumps of the Nautilus...</i>

01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:24.667
...we force air into the balloon
cloth, creating a huge air bubble...

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:28.796
...and floats to the surface bringing
the ship with it. It must work.

01:30:28.879 --> 01:30:33.425
Just possible, if the fabric
will hold the pressure.

01:30:33.509 --> 01:30:35.594
If there's a chance, we've got to try.

01:30:36.553 --> 01:30:38.472
By heaven, it is a chance.

01:30:40.015 --> 01:30:42.309
Captain Harding, get
the underwater equipment.

01:30:42.393 --> 01:30:44.770
And you'd better take the women with you.

01:30:45.062 --> 01:30:48.023
I'll stay to operate the pump
and to assemble my equipment.

01:30:48.107 --> 01:30:50.776
When this needle zeroes,
I'll know the ship is afloat.

01:30:50.859 --> 01:30:52.945
Right, we'll be back for you.

01:35:54.579 --> 01:35:55.747
Pencroft!

01:35:59.668 --> 01:36:03.129
Neb, signal Nemo, or none
of us will get out of here.

01:36:32.951 --> 01:36:35.495
The air's coming through,
Captain. Can you hear it?

01:37:33.762 --> 01:37:36.222
She's up! We've done it, Captain!

01:37:40.059 --> 01:37:41.603
All right, come on.

01:37:41.686 --> 01:37:44.606
We've got to get the women on
board and get back for Nemo.

01:40:14.464 --> 01:40:19.260
<i>We deeply regretted we could not save
the life of the man who had saved ours.</i>

01:40:19.343 --> 01:40:23.181
<i>A man who dedicated himself
to ending strife among men.</i>

01:40:24.348 --> 01:40:28.102
<i>And when we returned to civilization,
we all pledged ourselves to working...</i>

01:40:28.186 --> 01:40:32.940
<i>...for a peaceful and bountiful
world, as Captain Nemo would have it.</i>

01:40:33.305 --> 01:40:39.300
