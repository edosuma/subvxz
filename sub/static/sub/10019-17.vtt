WEBVTT

00:07.627 --> 00:09.634
- I'm fine.
- I'm getting too old!

00:09.867 --> 00:12.234
Shaq on Jordan at the buzzer!

00:16.108 --> 00:18.563
Still got your sneakers on, doc?

00:20.523 --> 00:22.411
You had better be passing!

00:24.875 --> 00:26.698
All right! Time-out!

00:27.276 --> 00:31.913
Keep bonding, Mark. I got it.
Malik, time to save a life.

00:32.843 --> 00:36.585
- Hey, doc, do you want some of this?
- Dad, what are you doing?

00:36.812 --> 00:39.048
- Busy night?
- Thought the sun would never rise.

00:39.211 --> 00:41.633
One more for the road.

00:41.868 --> 00:44.999
Tearful and upset?
That's her chief complaint?

00:45.164 --> 00:48.011
Mr. Thomas here OD'd on
his son's jimsonweed tea.

00:48.236 --> 00:50.440
We'll need to send this to the lab.

00:50.795 --> 00:53.643
- Jimsonweed?
- Gotta keep up with the times.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.364
- Anything else in it?
- No.

00:55.595 --> 00:58.378
When my dad comes down, he'll kill me.

00:58.604 --> 01:03.655
- Nurse, it hurts when I do this.
- Then don't do it, Mr. Thomas.

01:03.852 --> 01:07.365
I always use my diaphragm.
I'm a total fanatic about it. But...

01:07.596 --> 01:10.891
Did you have unprotected sex
in the last 72 hours?

01:11.051 --> 01:15.459
The girls at the dorm say you can take
a quadruple dose of birth control...

01:15.659 --> 01:18.561
...the morning after, and it will keep
you from getting pregnant.

01:18.764 --> 01:23.521
Yes, it can work. But it's not
the best method of birth control.

01:25.547 --> 01:29.606
It's just so weird.
My boyfriend will kill me.

01:29.803 --> 01:32.520
Did he force you or threaten you?

01:34.795 --> 01:37.283
Maybe I'm having
a nervous breakdown or something.

01:37.483 --> 01:40.615
I can help you if you tell me
what happened.

01:42.475 --> 01:44.995
I had a few beers
at this party last night.

01:45.195 --> 01:48.544
I saw this guy, Mike, and I was going
to give him a ride home.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.627
And then I woke up in my car
in a dorm parking lot.

01:51.819 --> 01:55.202
My tights weren't up all the way.
And I don't know what happened.

01:55.371 --> 01:57.379
- You don't remember?
- No.

01:58.220 --> 01:59.813
How well do you know Mike?

01:59.980 --> 02:03.328
- You're a hunky chunky one.
- What's wrong with this guy?

02:03.563 --> 02:07.076
Psychosis and hypersexuality
are toxic effects of jimsonweed.

02:07.275 --> 02:10.985
- Can't you give him something?
- What does your dad do?

02:11.212 --> 02:15.685
- He's a malpractice attorney.
- Medical malpractice? Really?

02:15.883 --> 02:19.080
Have you ever
seen anything so pretty?

02:19.307 --> 02:21.958
- It's not that pretty.
- Pretty as yours, doc?

02:22.155 --> 02:23.846
Hey! Come on!

02:24.011 --> 02:27.688
- Hey, Peter! Here you go.
- Light on Hick's service today?

02:27.884 --> 02:31.429
I'm covering the ER. I don't know
what these guys whine about.

02:31.595 --> 02:33.603
ER's a cakewalk
compared to Surgery.

02:33.836 --> 02:38.276
Cakewalk. Okay, how about
a little O.R. Versus ER?

02:38.507 --> 02:41.257
Loser takes the next gomer
who comes in the door.

02:41.451 --> 02:43.590
No. Squash is my game.

02:43.755 --> 02:45.926
- He's kidding.
- Yes, he's kidding.

02:46.155 --> 02:49.767
- Turkey, same stakes.
- Are there patients I can't handle?

02:49.964 --> 02:53.509
No, but one could tie you up
the whole day.

02:53.675 --> 02:56.228
All right. Sky hook, left-handed,
top of the key.

02:59.723 --> 03:01.283
Your shot, Dr. Carter.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:49.995 --> 03:53.704
Leave her hair in the doll's mouth.
The doctors'll figure it out.

03:53.899 --> 03:55.426
Sounds like one for you.

03:55.659 --> 03:58.790
Or maybe for our young surgeon
recently humiliated in hoops.

03:58.955 --> 04:01.989
- I think I have a better one.
- Bring on your worst.

04:02.220 --> 04:06.148
- Who made the tea?
- Is there a butcher in the house?

04:06.315 --> 04:08.966
Mrs. Chenovert, you need
to stay in your room.

04:09.163 --> 04:15.273
The room makes me jumpy. I gotta
get the chili fry out of my throat.

04:15.467 --> 04:19.296
- I still need to finish her history.
- That's what they said at St. David's.

04:19.500 --> 04:23.810
- I took two buses to get here.
- The pulse is 130.

04:24.044 --> 04:28.168
- Are you high on something? Crack?
- Crack? Never!

04:28.332 --> 04:31.976
Why don't you let her finish
and tell her what you're high on...

04:32.203 --> 04:34.308
...and then I have
the perfect surgeon for you.

04:34.507 --> 04:37.256
- What kind of surgeon?
- A young one.

04:37.419 --> 04:40.518
Private hospital turfed, that woman.
Can you imagine?

04:40.716 --> 04:42.887
Crackhead with abdominal pain.
What do you think?

04:43.115 --> 04:44.871
Oh, yes, Carter.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.849
- Want some tea?
- No, I'm cutting back on caffeine.

04:48.075 --> 04:50.945
- I think its herbal.
- Don't drink that!

04:51.115 --> 04:53.734
- You don't want to go there.
- Hey, Sasquatch!

04:53.963 --> 04:55.654
See what I'm talking about?

04:55.851 --> 05:00.008
Your drug screen came back positive
for roofies.

05:00.172 --> 05:03.881
Rohypnol. It knocks you out
and causes amnesia.

05:04.075 --> 05:07.239
- You mean he put it in my drink?
- Unless you took tranquilizers.

05:07.435 --> 05:10.948
Never! Oh, my God.
How could I have been so stupid?

05:11.147 --> 05:14.463
You weren't stupid. You just trusted
someone you shouldn't have.

05:16.459 --> 05:18.663
So what's going to happen?

05:18.859 --> 05:22.951
We need to do a medical evaluation.
And we have to call the police.

05:23.979 --> 05:28.234
But what if I'm wrong? I don't really
know what happened.

05:28.459 --> 05:34.602
I mean, when I woke up, I didn't know
for sure that I had had sex.

05:35.371 --> 05:38.371
- He may have used a condom.
- Then it's my word against his.

05:38.539 --> 05:42.019
Let's finish your medical evaluation.
We might find some evidence.

05:47.019 --> 05:51.143
Need some help here! Two GSWs.
Hope you're in the mood.

05:51.339 --> 05:54.121
Bad drug deal.
Guy fired in a Fly Burger.

05:54.347 --> 05:56.965
- Injuries?
- Single GSW to left flank.

05:57.195 --> 06:00.512
Vitals stable, good breath sounds,
IV, saline TKO.

06:00.683 --> 06:03.683
- Some guy shot me!
- It's always some guy.

06:03.915 --> 06:06.817
Doyle, get him into Trauma 2.
Malik!

06:07.020 --> 06:10.697
- Employee, 17, hit in the left chest.
- Check for weapons and needles.

06:10.891 --> 06:14.503
Plus a through-and-through to the
right deltoid. BP's falling, 90/54.

06:14.667 --> 06:19.337
Sinus tach at 120. Two marks
for IVS. One liter of saline in.

06:19.563 --> 06:21.799
This one is more critical.
Grab the portable from 2.

06:22.027 --> 06:25.987
H and H. Type and cross, 4 units.
Two units of O-neg just in case...

06:26.155 --> 06:28.294
...and portable chest.
- Something for the pain?

06:28.492 --> 06:32.386
Stand by with morphine. Guess you
need hazard pay for slinging burgers.

06:32.619 --> 06:37.027
- Belly's tender. Set up a lavage.
- Pulse ox is 92 on 15 liters.

06:37.195 --> 06:41.188
He might have a peritoneal violation.
Give him oxygen.

06:41.419 --> 06:43.754
- What have you got?
- A cake for you to walk.

06:43.883 --> 06:47.298
Exam 2. I need a
surgical consult...

06:47.531 --> 06:51.110
...on a lovely crackhead sent
over courtesy of the St. David's ER.

06:51.307 --> 06:54.177
- That sounds like a dump.
- You lost fair and square.

06:54.379 --> 06:57.412
- What about this guy?
- Forget it, Carter.

06:57.611 --> 06:58.953
It's gomer tag, and you're it.

07:00.715 --> 07:02.209
- Where's Malik?
- Calling Radiology.

07:02.443 --> 07:04.549
- I was just standing there.
- Hold still.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.715
- You're okay alone?
- Yes. He wasn't armed.

07:07.947 --> 07:10.795
- I don't own a gun!
- Call me if you need me.

07:13.195 --> 07:15.399
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for my brother.

07:15.563 --> 07:19.622
Visitors can't go in during a trauma.
Go to the desk.

07:19.819 --> 07:21.445
Kenny!

07:22.763 --> 07:25.218
- Kenny, are you all right?
- You have to wait outside.

07:25.419 --> 07:27.940
- He's my brother!
- You still have to go outside.

07:28.171 --> 07:31.432
Cops won't let me past the tape,
medics won't let me in the ambulance.

07:31.595 --> 07:34.116
- Who capped you?
- I don't know.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.784
- Would you get him something?
- They think I'm a gangbanger.

07:38.987 --> 07:42.631
I haven't finished assessing him.
Please wait outside!

07:44.331 --> 07:46.852
Why're you swarming around this boy?
My brother is dying!

07:47.051 --> 07:50.150
Nobody is dying anywhere. Family
members need to wait outside.

07:50.347 --> 07:52.900
- You in charge?
- Haleh, could you...?

07:53.099 --> 07:56.295
Don't make no sister shoo me away.
Get your ass in there and fix him up!

07:56.491 --> 07:58.498
We treat
the most critical patients first.

07:58.699 --> 08:02.147
- Kenny's been shot.
- You're delaying his treatment.

08:02.347 --> 08:06.057
- So why don't you wait outside?
- You think he's a gangster!

08:06.283 --> 08:09.895
- We treat everybody the same.
- Same for the white boy?

08:10.091 --> 08:14.020
- Dr. Greene, need you in here.
- Lydia, come with me.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.345
- He bradied down, BP bottomed out.
- Give him anything?

08:18.539 --> 08:20.449
- No.
- Give me a 14 gauge.

08:20.619 --> 08:23.008
- Pulse ox is 85.
- Lungs sounded okay.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.251
He's got a tension pneumo.

08:28.555 --> 08:31.457
- Get that portable in here!
- What happened?

08:31.659 --> 08:35.139
You must constantly reassess
a penetrating trauma.

08:35.371 --> 08:38.020
- What's wrong with him?
- BP is only 70 palp.

08:38.219 --> 08:41.961
I'm gonna put in the chest tube.
You set me up with a 32 French.

08:42.187 --> 08:45.034
- I told you he needed help!
- He will be fine. What's his name?

08:45.227 --> 08:47.332
- Kenny Law.
- The Southside basketball kid?

08:47.499 --> 08:51.459
- You've got to represent for him!
- He was All-City point guard.

08:53.995 --> 08:56.843
- Yo, black man! Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

08:57.035 --> 09:00.647
- You gotta take care of Kenny!
- Guy's stable. Go ahead.

09:02.539 --> 09:05.671
Hey, you! Get off!
Don't you touch him!

09:05.899 --> 09:08.997
- I need a new tray. Call Security!
- What's going on?

09:09.163 --> 09:11.552
I got a tension pneumo.
Trying to get the chest tube in.

09:11.787 --> 09:16.097
- Let us do our jobs, okay?
- Mg of atropine and a unit of O-neg.

09:19.883 --> 09:22.632
- Hook up the Thora-Seal.
- Looks arterial.

09:22.827 --> 09:26.918
Somebody call the O.R.
Tell them we're on our way.

09:28.203 --> 09:32.393
- So after you choked on the chili fry?
- Who said anything about choking?

09:32.587 --> 09:38.632
- You!
- No, the burning started right after.

09:39.531 --> 09:43.655
All right. And the burning has
lasted on and off for three weeks.

09:45.483 --> 09:49.160
Babs? Where is your pain?

09:51.435 --> 09:53.606
Yeah? That's more like your chest.

09:54.859 --> 09:57.706
You're so much nicer
than that Dr. Smith.

09:57.899 --> 10:01.761
Thanks. I need to examine you.
I'll call St. David's...

10:01.963 --> 10:04.265
...see if I can find the doctor
who took care of you there.

10:04.459 --> 10:08.321
You can leave your clothes on for now.
Take a deep breath.

10:09.995 --> 10:12.264
And out.

10:12.459 --> 10:15.623
- Hey, Kerry.
- Hey. I called you last night.

10:15.819 --> 10:18.721
- I was out with Greg.
- How's that going?

10:18.955 --> 10:22.184
Would you mind writing me
a script for a new diaphragm?

10:22.347 --> 10:24.965
- It's going pretty well then.
- We haven't done anything.

10:25.195 --> 10:28.905
I've got condoms.
I'll get a new diaphragm.

10:29.099 --> 10:32.231
I'm carefully planning for
a possible spontaneous moment.

10:32.427 --> 10:35.776
- That's great, Jeanie.
- My viral load is down.

10:35.979 --> 10:40.485
I'm not sure if I should expose Greg
to HIV unless he's the one.

10:40.683 --> 10:44.163
Not just because I'm Ionely and haven't
had sex in a year and a half.

10:44.362 --> 10:46.697
- I got one for you.
- I'll take it.

10:49.931 --> 10:52.931
Woman, 61/2 months pregnant,
rear-ended by a pickup truck.

10:53.099 --> 10:56.361
Seat-belted. No abdominal pain
or cramping. Refused IV.

10:56.586 --> 10:59.969
- Main complaint is right ankle pain.
- Hi, I'm Jeanie Boulet.

11:00.139 --> 11:03.521
I'm Carla Reece.
Girlfriend, I gotta pee.

11:03.723 --> 11:07.170
This is Mr. And Mrs. Brodie.
Their son works at the Fly Burger.

11:07.371 --> 11:10.786
- We heard he was shot.
- He's stable but needs surgery.

11:10.986 --> 11:13.158
- Will he be okay?
- I think so.

11:13.355 --> 11:17.250
You can go in and see him
before we take him to the O.R.

11:17.931 --> 11:22.121
They get the red carpet escort
while you call Security on me.

11:22.347 --> 11:24.900
The patient is waiting for surgery.
He's not critical.

11:25.099 --> 11:27.466
He was when you were letting
Kenny bleed to death.

11:27.627 --> 11:30.823
They were treated based
on what we saw on initial exam.

11:31.050 --> 11:34.399
What you saw. Just another shot
nigger's what you saw.

11:41.610 --> 11:45.888
He's had a gram of cefoxatin, D.T.
And 5 of morphine. BP's up, 110/70.

11:46.123 --> 11:49.538
Good. In English that
means he's doing well.

11:49.707 --> 11:54.082
There's been some internal bleeding.
We need your consent to do surgery.

11:54.283 --> 11:56.072
- Of course.
- Was anyone else hurt?

11:56.266 --> 11:59.234
There was another young man.
We took him up to surgery.

11:59.435 --> 12:03.876
I know this is hard. He was
at the wrong place at the wrong time.

12:04.042 --> 12:06.825
Billy is always in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

12:07.051 --> 12:10.499
It doesn't matter
how much we threaten or worry.

12:12.011 --> 12:15.557
Our son is a crack dealer.
It's just a matter of time.

12:18.090 --> 12:19.552
What?

12:19.787 --> 12:24.457
The black kid isn't a banger, and he
isn't a dealer, and we assumed he was.

12:24.651 --> 12:28.296
I didn't assume anything.
One was stable, the other wasn't.

12:28.491 --> 12:30.401
- There it is.
- How can you tell?

12:30.603 --> 12:33.799
Semen glows in ultraviolet light.
We're gonna have to take a swab.

12:34.731 --> 12:39.302
- Oh, my God! He raped me.
- I'm afraid he did.

12:39.466 --> 12:42.314
I'm also gonna have
to comb for a few hairs.

12:42.507 --> 12:45.354
I could have VD or AIDS.

12:45.578 --> 12:49.604
We'll give you antibiotics
for sexually transmitted diseases.

12:49.770 --> 12:53.087
- And you should be tested for AIDS.
- Oh, my God!

12:53.771 --> 12:56.007
I called Rita James.

12:56.234 --> 13:00.195
She's a counselor who specializes
in women in your situation.

13:00.395 --> 13:05.861
If you don't tell the police about
this, he'll do it to someone else.

13:07.595 --> 13:11.305
The mixture of alcohol and roofies
might kill his next victim.

13:15.082 --> 13:19.457
- Will you stay with me?
- Of course I will.

13:19.659 --> 13:24.842
Yes. No, you saw her today.
Chili-fry indigestion.

13:25.546 --> 13:27.335
I need her records faxed over.

13:27.531 --> 13:30.847
Shouldn't cost you more
than the bus token you gave her.

13:31.083 --> 13:36.353
I need them now! You can't just dump
people that don't have insurance.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.147
Go, Johnny, go.

13:38.347 --> 13:39.808
- Mark?
- Hello.

13:39.946 --> 13:42.215
This is Dan Ferkich.
He's Kenny's basketball coach.

13:42.443 --> 13:44.483
Mark took care of Kenny.

13:44.683 --> 13:47.050
Someone from Woodlawn Park
must've got him.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.276
- Settle down.
- Kenny's at the O.R.

13:50.475 --> 13:52.809
- His brother went with him.
- Chris is on it? Good.

13:53.003 --> 13:56.548
- Will he be all right by Saturday?
- He was shot, coach.

13:56.778 --> 13:59.200
- Damn, man!
- We gotta call the guys.

13:59.402 --> 14:02.948
- How can I check on how he's doing?
- Go to the Surgical Waiting Room.

14:03.115 --> 14:06.344
Someone there can inform you.
These guys have to wait here.

14:06.570 --> 14:08.774
Okay, you stay here.

14:12.299 --> 14:16.576
- Is that my baby's heartbeat?
- Yes. Good and strong.

14:17.579 --> 14:20.427
- What a sweet sound.
- Yes, it is.

14:21.707 --> 14:25.384
- Everything appears to be fine.
- Thank God!

14:25.578 --> 14:28.513
- How far along are you?
- 61/2 months.

14:28.715 --> 14:31.682
We'll have to monitor you
for contractions.

14:31.882 --> 14:34.916
We'll shield your baby,
take an x-ray of that ankle...

14:35.147 --> 14:37.351
...and put some stitches in this arm.

14:37.515 --> 14:41.093
Couldn't you just tape it together
or something?

14:41.290 --> 14:45.414
I could Steri-Strip it, but you get
a much better result with stitches.

14:45.611 --> 14:47.945
The thing is, I hate needles.

14:48.810 --> 14:51.745
You're planning on going through
childbirth without an epidural?

14:51.946 --> 14:56.419
Honey, women were having babies
long before doctors and needles.

14:57.675 --> 15:00.904
- Why can't they come up?
- We want to see him too.

15:01.098 --> 15:03.619
Only immediate family are allowed
on the surgical floor.

15:03.851 --> 15:06.272
- They let coach come up.
- They shouldn't have.

15:06.442 --> 15:09.409
I see what this is. It's all right.
I hang with y'all here.

15:09.643 --> 15:12.774
- How is Kenny doing?
- Nobody knows.

15:12.939 --> 15:16.484
That's because they don't tell you
nothing around here.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.985
- What's this?
- The natives are restless.

15:19.178 --> 15:21.699
- I heard that.
- It's an expression.

15:21.899 --> 15:24.768
- They live here, they're natives.
- That's not what you meant.

15:24.971 --> 15:27.840
Hold on. Jerry, let's just knock off
those kind of remarks.

15:28.043 --> 15:32.003
The kids heard a rumor that Kenny was
shot by a guy betting for the game.

15:32.203 --> 15:35.913
- Was he shot over a basketball game?
- Kids get shot over basketball shoes.

15:36.139 --> 15:38.986
Maybe you should set them straight.
White kid was a drug dealer, right?

15:39.211 --> 15:44.066
It's not our job to spread rumors
or to stop them. It's confidential.

15:44.267 --> 15:48.325
- The kids look pretty riled up.
- The police should handle it.

15:49.131 --> 15:50.538
Daddy!

15:51.243 --> 15:55.236
Hey! Oh, girl! You're too big.

15:56.106 --> 15:59.172
- Something wrong?
- Mom had a stroke this morning.

15:59.371 --> 16:02.567
- How is she?
- She's in the ICU in Sarasota.

16:02.763 --> 16:05.796
She's paralyzed on one side
and can't talk.

16:06.026 --> 16:07.368
Let's go in the lounge.

16:09.354 --> 16:12.136
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, thanks.

16:12.363 --> 16:16.618
We're flying down this afternoon.
Rachel wanted to see you first.

16:16.842 --> 16:20.258
- Will she be home by the weekend?
- I don't think so, Mark.

16:20.426 --> 16:23.972
She's gonna miss both school
and soccer? Maybe that's not...

16:24.170 --> 16:27.749
- I can't miss soccer! I'm the goalie!
- I'll talk to the coach.

16:27.946 --> 16:30.051
Why can't she stay with me?

16:31.019 --> 16:35.110
- How can you do that and work?
- You do it. I can take her to school.

16:35.274 --> 16:39.333
Ruth can pick her up
and keep her till I come home.

16:39.562 --> 16:42.312
I want to stay here with Daddy.

16:43.531 --> 16:45.319
I can handle it.

16:46.155 --> 16:49.799
Gonna have to transect at the sternum.
Lebsche.

16:49.995 --> 16:52.777
I hear our patient
is quite the basketball player.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.266
- NBA material.
- Been busy in outpatient surgery?

16:56.458 --> 17:01.543
I've been busy all right. Especially
since I don't have an intern.

17:01.739 --> 17:05.895
Well, Dr. Carter asked
to be transferred to my team.

17:06.089 --> 17:08.130
You don't think
I would poach him from you?

17:08.362 --> 17:10.695
No, of course not.

17:10.858 --> 17:14.241
Not unless it was for his own good.

17:15.883 --> 17:18.849
Richardson. Suction.

17:19.723 --> 17:23.878
I finally got someone at St. David's
to fax me your records.

17:24.074 --> 17:27.271
- What time you got?
- Wasn't the doctor's name Smith?

17:27.465 --> 17:31.176
- No, that was my doctor from before.
- Was he a cardiologist?

17:32.010 --> 17:34.760
Heart doctor?

17:34.954 --> 17:38.980
I got a party to get to.
Maybe I should come back tomorrow.

17:39.211 --> 17:41.993
Wow. I'd love to let you go, Babs...

17:42.218 --> 17:45.633
...but this EKG tells me
that you should be here for a while.

17:45.835 --> 17:48.420
She should be on a monitor.
O-2 and a Hep-Lock.

17:48.619 --> 17:50.920
See if they got enough blood
to do cardiac enzymes.

17:51.114 --> 17:54.016
- Didn't they run those at St. David's?
- No.

17:54.186 --> 17:57.896
They didn't notice the flipped T waves
and the nonspecific ST changes.

17:58.059 --> 18:00.001
- Is that bad?
- It could be.

18:00.235 --> 18:03.017
Or it could be the way your EKG
always looks.

18:03.242 --> 18:05.860
Dr. Smith ever tell you
that you had heart trouble?

18:06.059 --> 18:07.401
You're nice.

18:07.594 --> 18:11.336
- You're sure you're a surgeon?
- Sometimes I wonder.

18:11.594 --> 18:15.457
Here's your referral, antibiotic
prescription and birth control pills.

18:15.659 --> 18:18.528
I want you to take two now,
and two in 12 hours.

18:19.691 --> 18:23.847
If you don't get your period in three
weeks, come in for a pregnancy test.

18:24.010 --> 18:26.912
- Do you need any help getting home?
- My boyfriend's here.

18:27.115 --> 18:29.897
- Would you like me to speak to him?
- No, I'm fine.

18:30.091 --> 18:31.236
Okay.

18:37.323 --> 18:40.618
- Hey, weren't you off hours ago?
- Yes.

18:40.811 --> 18:43.778
You've been working a lot
since you got back. Are you okay?

18:43.978 --> 18:47.295
Yes, Doug, I'm fine.
I'm gonna go home and sleep all day.

18:47.498 --> 18:49.254
- See you.
- Okay.

18:50.186 --> 18:52.707
- Only a couple of mild contractions.
- Is that okay?

18:52.906 --> 18:55.589
Less than six an hour is okay.
Is this your first pregnancy?

18:55.786 --> 18:58.688
- Yes.
- Do you know your blood type?

18:58.859 --> 19:01.728
- It's A-negative.
- And who's your OB?

19:01.931 --> 19:05.160
- Dr. Coburn. That stings!
- Sorry.

19:06.602 --> 19:10.312
- When are you due?
- June 15th.

19:10.538 --> 19:13.156
I'm gonna be a caboose by then.

19:13.355 --> 19:16.355
- You got any kids?
- No, I don't.

19:18.730 --> 19:21.414
You and your husband must be excited.

19:21.610 --> 19:25.287
It's just me and the baby.
I'm fine with it.

19:25.483 --> 19:30.698
The father would howl and try to chew
his leg off like a trapped coyote.

19:30.858 --> 19:33.575
- I know the type.
- Plenty of them around.

19:33.771 --> 19:38.856
- They think they're God's gift.
- I definitely know the type.

19:40.298 --> 19:44.902
- There they are. Two wedding rings.
- He doesn't want Mom to get married.

19:45.098 --> 19:47.815
It's normal at his age.
They should pass in a day or two.

19:48.011 --> 19:50.880
You mean we gotta wait
till he poops them out?

19:51.082 --> 19:53.417
Dr. Weaver, we need you out here.

19:56.651 --> 20:00.513
We got a handicapped guy jaywalking
on Michigan. "Jaywheeling."

20:00.682 --> 20:03.333
- Handicapped?
- Is that wrong, ma'am?

20:03.531 --> 20:06.531
Back there's his wheelchair.
A car hit it, threw him 15 feet.

20:06.730 --> 20:08.934
Head, right chest
and shoulder trauma.

20:09.131 --> 20:12.447
BP's 100/60. Pulse is only 15.
GCS is 12.

20:12.650 --> 20:16.392
- How do you say "handicapped"?
- Person with a disability.

20:16.619 --> 20:18.080
Okay, everybody, let's go.

20:19.626 --> 20:22.081
- What's your name?
- I'm breaking loose.

20:23.498 --> 20:26.400
Pupils are sluggish.
Where are you injured?

20:26.602 --> 20:29.058
- Everywhere. Get off me!
- How much did you drink?

20:29.291 --> 20:30.884
A couple of beers.

20:31.082 --> 20:34.911
- BP is 90/50, pulse is 60 and thready.
- He's high on something.

20:35.082 --> 20:40.167
Cross-table C-spine, Chem-7,
blood alcohol and tox screen.

20:40.363 --> 20:44.324
- Do you want to pump him now?
- No. We roll him over if he vomits.

20:44.522 --> 20:45.951
Don't put that snake on me!

20:48.299 --> 20:53.220
Swallow when you feel this
at the back of your throat.

20:58.570 --> 21:00.457
- What's that for?
- I spoke with Dr. Coburn.

21:00.650 --> 21:04.709
- We gotta do a Kleinhauer-Betke test.
- You mean stick me with that needle?

21:04.874 --> 21:06.848
You have A-negative blood,
so you're Rh-negative.

21:07.050 --> 21:11.076
If the father is Rh-positive,
the baby can be too.

21:11.274 --> 21:15.682
That can cause a condition called
erythroblastosis fetallis.

21:15.883 --> 21:18.665
If this test is positive,
we'll give you RhoGAM.

21:18.890 --> 21:23.778
Wait. Time out. What if the father
has negative whatever?

21:23.978 --> 21:26.083
Then you don't need the test.

21:28.394 --> 21:31.623
- I just don't think I can bother him.
- It's worth a phone call.

21:31.786 --> 21:35.299
You ask for his blood type,
not his love and support.

21:35.530 --> 21:40.898
Yes, well. He... actually,
he works here at this hospital.

21:41.547 --> 21:43.586
- Which department?
- He's a doctor.

21:43.819 --> 21:47.201
- We have a lot of doctors.
- His name is Peter Benton.

21:52.394 --> 21:57.064
So Dr. Smith has never seen a patient
named Chenovert? Okay, thank you.

21:57.290 --> 22:00.389
Still busy with the chili-fry woman?
You should work on your jump shot.

22:00.586 --> 22:04.809
I'm trying to track down
a cardiologist named Smith...

22:05.034 --> 22:09.704
...who saw her years ago. Do you
know how many Smiths there are?

22:09.930 --> 22:12.167
Hi, this is Dr. John Carter
from County General ER.

22:17.738 --> 22:22.277
The group is getting big. Can you
ask them to go to the Waiting Room?

22:23.435 --> 22:27.329
- Is there a problem?
- No, not a problem at all.

22:27.531 --> 22:30.792
Dad, where have you been?

22:31.979 --> 22:35.721
- When's Ruth coming?
- I need you to wait in the lounge.

22:35.946 --> 22:37.507
- Dad!
- Come on.

22:38.506 --> 22:42.848
Is everything okay? I thought
you were gonna draw me a picture.

22:43.018 --> 22:45.953
Are you not taking care of Grandma
because you and Mom are divorced?

22:46.154 --> 22:47.910
Of course not.

22:48.106 --> 22:51.008
The doctor where Grandma lives
is taking care of her...

22:51.210 --> 22:55.618
...just like I would take care of
the doctor's family if they were here.

22:55.818 --> 22:58.786
Mark, paramedics
are pulling up with a GSW.

22:59.914 --> 23:03.231
- What is a GSW?
- I'll let you know when Ruth is here.

23:03.466 --> 23:07.459
He's from Woodlawn Park.
He was shot coming out of practice.

23:07.626 --> 23:10.790
- Can be payback for Kenny Law.
- Drive-by shooting. 16-year-old.

23:11.018 --> 23:14.052
Hit twice, left chest, right thigh.
BP's down to 60.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.072
- Any witnesses?
- Don't know.

23:16.266 --> 23:19.528
O-2 at 15 liters. Two large-bore
IV's, a liter of saline.

23:26.091 --> 23:29.320
- 7.5.
- I'll call Radiology for a portable.

23:29.514 --> 23:32.296
- First unit of O-neg's in.
- Need any help?

23:32.522 --> 23:35.140
- Check the thigh wound.
- This guy's from Woodlawn Park?

23:35.339 --> 23:36.997
Yep. He's the starting center.

23:37.194 --> 23:40.490
- Babysitter. Should she call back?
- No, give me the phone.

23:40.714 --> 23:43.976
Hi, can you pick up Rachel
at the hospital?

23:44.138 --> 23:47.040
Left chest, right thigh.
How about tomorrow after school?

23:47.242 --> 23:50.952
- How many units do you want?
- Six.

23:51.146 --> 23:52.488
I'm in.

23:54.602 --> 23:58.530
- BP's coming up.
- We have a handle on him now.

23:58.762 --> 24:01.959
- Doyle, put in a chest tube.
- Sure.

24:02.122 --> 24:06.312
- Is this payback for the other kid?
- I have no idea.

24:10.890 --> 24:15.047
Your tox screen came back positive
for opiates, cocaine, benzos...

24:15.274 --> 24:17.543
...plus your alcohol level is
three times the legal limit.

24:17.706 --> 24:21.252
You gonna bust me on a WUI?
"Wheeling under the influence"?

24:21.450 --> 24:26.022
- I'm just saying it's a lot of drugs.
- I'm a cripple, I'm in a lot of pain.

24:26.219 --> 24:30.561
You got a T4 deficit from
a gunshot wound two years ago?

24:30.762 --> 24:32.672
You the geek expert?

24:33.706 --> 24:35.746
You stick with your rehab?

24:37.898 --> 24:40.319
Are you getting physical therapy?

24:43.050 --> 24:45.767
I know it's a hard transition.
But nothing comes easy.

24:45.962 --> 24:49.126
Not that crap. You gotta rise above.
And for what?

24:49.290 --> 24:52.192
- So I can try out for gimp Olympics?
- I wasn't thinking that far ahead.

24:52.362 --> 24:54.850
- What about detox?
- I'm not interested.

24:55.082 --> 24:59.751
- Then you can get back in rehab.
- Just give me something for the pain!

25:03.050 --> 25:06.346
- There it is. Bovie that one.
- How many units has he had?

25:06.506 --> 25:10.630
- Twelve. Two are fresh frozen plasma.
- He'll never play basketball again.

25:10.858 --> 25:14.470
He'll be lucky if he lives. We're
gonna have to resect this lung.

25:14.666 --> 25:17.449
- Dr. Benton, I need to talk to you.
- I'm in the middle of surgery.

25:17.674 --> 25:21.318
- I need to talk to you in private.
- Can't it wait?

25:21.514 --> 25:24.449
I wouldn't have changed into scrubs
if it could wait.

25:24.618 --> 25:27.914
Go ahead.
We'll be okay for a few minutes.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.452
- What is it?
- Do you know your blood type?

25:36.682 --> 25:39.235
- No. Why?
- Carla Reece is in the ER.

25:40.554 --> 25:44.448
- Is she okay?
- She had a minor TC, ankle sprain.

25:44.650 --> 25:48.359
She's Rh-negative and Coburn's
worried about Rh incompatibility.

25:48.586 --> 25:50.724
- What about a K-B?
- She refuses.

25:50.890 --> 25:53.225
Yeah, she's afraid of needles.

25:53.450 --> 25:56.745
I need some of your blood for typing.
I can get somebody else to do it.

25:56.906 --> 25:58.662
No, it's fine. You can do it.

25:59.786 --> 26:02.983
- Okay. What about the locker room?
- Yeah.

26:03.178 --> 26:05.829
- Good breath sounds.
- Got this one under control.

26:06.026 --> 26:08.262
He's drained about 300 cc's,
but the bleeding's stopped.

26:08.458 --> 26:10.597
Any word from the O.R.
On the other basketball casualty?

26:10.794 --> 26:14.023
- Kenny Law's still in surgery.
- Will they cancel the game?

26:15.338 --> 26:18.055
- Both teams lost a starter.
- Hope they do before more happens.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.072
I'm waiting for the next kid
to be wheeled in.

26:20.266 --> 26:24.772
This guy's stable. Haleh,
call the O.R. And get him transported.

26:32.426 --> 26:35.394
- Hey.
- Family allowed to use this machine?

26:35.594 --> 26:39.074
- One in the Waiting Room is broken.
- How's your brother doing in Surgery?

26:39.274 --> 26:42.056
- I don't know.
- Do you want me to try to find out?

26:42.282 --> 26:44.737
You could do that.

26:44.970 --> 26:48.799
I heard some information about
the shooting that I didn't give you.

26:48.970 --> 26:51.937
It was drug-related
and involved the other victim.

26:52.138 --> 26:55.455
- Your brother was a bystander.
- Okay.

26:56.650 --> 27:00.261
The Woodlawn Park student
was just shot in a drive-by.

27:00.425 --> 27:03.906
- So?
- There was no need for retaliation.

27:05.034 --> 27:06.659
Are you accusing me
for having that white boy shot?

27:06.858 --> 27:10.687
I told you in case you know someone
who would think of revenge.

27:11.754 --> 27:15.299
Who do you think you're talking to?
You neither know my hood nor me.

27:15.530 --> 27:19.808
I know about the gunshot victims
that come in here every day.

27:19.978 --> 27:23.524
- You think you know my life?
- I see them die!

27:23.721 --> 27:26.721
And you think I can stop that?
Little do you know.

27:26.953 --> 27:30.532
That's not your brother who had his blood
spilled and is lying on that table!

27:30.698 --> 27:36.164
You don't know a damn thing!
Back off and stay out of my face.

27:39.114 --> 27:41.984
I found Dr. Smith. Yancy Smith.

27:42.218 --> 27:45.381
I got him to dig out one of your old
EKGs, and it was normal.

27:45.545 --> 27:48.709
- Ducky.
- Maybe not so ducky.

27:48.938 --> 27:52.286
A change in your EKG
could signal a heart problem.

27:52.458 --> 27:55.492
- All from chili fries?
- A lifetime of chili fries, maybe?

27:55.722 --> 27:58.853
But I feel better. And this thing
is getting on my nerves.

27:59.050 --> 28:04.167
You feel better because of the
nitropatch. Let the tech do her job.

28:04.330 --> 28:07.232
I will come back and check on you
after I've looked at your enzymes.

28:07.434 --> 28:09.190
- Don't forget me.
- How could I?

28:11.369 --> 28:15.363
- Does she want me to come by?
- She didn't say that.

28:15.561 --> 28:19.685
- Did she say she didn't want that?
- She didn't say that either.

28:21.834 --> 28:25.696
Okay. I've gotta go scrub in again.

28:25.865 --> 28:27.426
- Peter.
- Yes?

28:32.841 --> 28:34.532
- Thanks.
- Sure.

28:38.922 --> 28:42.533
Dr. Ross? Collision at second base.

28:43.145 --> 28:46.244
- You must have been hit hard.
- It's the All-Star League.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.808
- You get punched in the eye?
- He landed on me with his elbow.

28:48.970 --> 28:52.799
Let's get orbital films on that eye.
And set me up for suturing.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.816
- Still here.
- You on hold?

28:55.978 --> 28:59.808
I just called a Cardiology consult.
They're getting Babs' old records out.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.667
- Babs?
- Are you on with the O.R.?

29:01.866 --> 29:04.517
Tell them we're still waiting to
transport that kid from Woodlawn Park.

29:04.714 --> 29:07.943
Okay, thanks. We're still waiting
for the transport of a GSW.

29:08.105 --> 29:10.887
- Mark, I have a question for you.
- Just a second.

29:11.114 --> 29:14.114
Malik, can you tell the Law family
that there's still no word?

29:14.314 --> 29:16.387
Kenny's still in surgery.
They're in the Waiting Room.

29:16.586 --> 29:20.547
- I know where they are.
- I want them to have an update.

29:22.346 --> 29:26.656
There's this guy I want to get
into Detox, but he's a hard sell.

29:26.890 --> 29:31.330
He's defensive and doesn't want
to ask for help. Plus he's uninsured.

29:31.498 --> 29:33.953
So he won't be admitted, and if he is,
can't pay for it?

29:34.154 --> 29:36.325
That would be
the "glass is half empty" viewpoint.

29:36.553 --> 29:41.474
Just make sure we're not wasting a bed
on somebody who isn't motivated.

29:41.642 --> 29:45.025
- That is a hard sell.
- Kid in trauma is bradying down.

29:45.226 --> 29:47.201
Carter, time to play surgeon.

29:47.402 --> 29:49.988
Jerry, if that cardiologist comes,
tell him I'm looking for him.

29:50.186 --> 29:54.594
He was stable, waiting for O.R. Blood
started pouring out of his chest tube.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.193
- Carter, help me crack him.
- Rib spreader.

29:57.354 --> 29:58.696
- Suction's ready.
- Blood's here.

29:58.889 --> 30:02.566
- Put two units on the rapid infuser.
- I'll incise the pericardium. Metz.

30:02.762 --> 30:05.861
Look at that.
Bullet hole, right atrium.

30:06.090 --> 30:09.472
- We won't be able to clamp it.
- No. Too much tissue is blown away.

30:11.113 --> 30:14.528
I'll tie in a Foley. That way we'll
get a tamponade and a blood port.

30:14.730 --> 30:18.407
- Give it a try.
- 4.0 Prolene and a unit of O-neg.

30:18.601 --> 30:22.496
- Carter's on fire.
- He's better with his scalpel.

30:24.490 --> 30:28.483
Yes, I know beds are tight.
But the patient's brush with death...

30:28.682 --> 30:31.399
...has given us a window
of opportunity to...

30:31.594 --> 30:36.350
No. I assure you that Mr. Brown
is highly motivated to change.

30:36.554 --> 30:40.263
Okay. Great.
I'll send him right up. Thank you.

30:41.322 --> 30:44.519
Now if you could just sell it
to the patient.

30:48.617 --> 30:51.966
- I'm seeing an idioventricular rhythm.
- Give me another mg of epi.

30:52.170 --> 30:55.465
- Faint pulse.
- Let's get him ready to move up.

30:55.658 --> 31:00.098
- What have you got?
- Candidate for a pericardial patch...

31:00.298 --> 31:04.488
...thanks to your intern.
- How's the basketball player doing?

31:04.714 --> 31:08.162
- First guy we sent up.
- Died on the table 20 minutes ago.

31:08.938 --> 31:10.694
Okay, let's move him.

31:16.874 --> 31:20.289
- Sorry to keep you here all day.
- I've had a good day.

31:20.522 --> 31:24.067
- Want to scrub in?
- No, I have a surgical consult.

31:24.266 --> 31:26.754
Okay. Slick piece of work.

31:29.514 --> 31:32.132
- Thought you had forgotten us.
- I had an emergency.

31:32.298 --> 31:34.665
How did you guys get hurt?

31:34.858 --> 31:37.575
Tommy broke up a double play.
The kid fell on top of him.

31:37.769 --> 31:41.414
- X-rays look okay.
- That was a mugging, Plosay.

31:41.609 --> 31:45.766
- That was a clean, hard slide.
- Three feet outside the base path?

31:45.961 --> 31:48.929
- Your kid elbowed mine on purpose.
- Can we talk outside?

31:49.130 --> 31:53.091
If he can't take a hit,
he shouldn't be in the league!

31:54.634 --> 31:56.576
Excuse us, fellas.

31:59.657 --> 32:03.651
You got great kids who want to play
ball. Let them keep it on the field.

32:04.297 --> 32:08.804
All right, guys. Let me see this eye.
Drop that thing down.

32:09.001 --> 32:12.482
- Malik, can you join me?
- What for?

32:12.681 --> 32:15.169
Kenny Law died.
I have to tell his family.

32:15.338 --> 32:19.299
If you're scared, you should call
Security. I'm a nurse.

32:30.698 --> 32:35.008
Mr. Law, word just came
down from the O.R.

32:35.210 --> 32:38.374
- It's not good news.
- What is it?

32:39.338 --> 32:45.797
The surgeons weren't able
to repair the damage in time.

32:46.826 --> 32:48.931
Is he dead?

32:52.041 --> 32:55.205
They were unable
to save your brother's life.

33:32.554 --> 33:36.099
- When did the contractions start?
- Right before Dr. Coburn came.

33:36.938 --> 33:40.004
- This is far too early!
- The father's blood type?

33:40.234 --> 33:45.122
No Rh incompatibility. I'll give you an
ultrasound after we stop your labor.

33:45.290 --> 33:49.152
- IV drip of mag sulfate.
- No. No IV!

33:49.353 --> 33:53.183
It's okay, Carla. I'll do it.

33:54.953 --> 33:57.375
Give me a pain shot!

33:57.577 --> 34:01.090
It's hard to get a person without
insurance into the Detox Program.

34:01.290 --> 34:05.763
- I don't care.
- Your chair's messed up.

34:05.961 --> 34:09.125
- Give it 48 hours.
- No, I'm out of here.

34:09.322 --> 34:13.728
- Should I write up an AMA form?
- No. I'll make you a deal.

34:13.929 --> 34:18.719
Demerol 100, Phenergan 50.
It's yours if you check into Detox.

34:18.922 --> 34:21.670
- Dr. Weaver.
- Just give it a couple of days.

34:21.866 --> 34:24.996
Give yourself a chance
to get your life together.

34:25.225 --> 34:27.592
- Are you trying to bribe me?
- Do you want it?

34:29.833 --> 34:36.161
Okay. Let's do it your way, doc.
Just give it a couple days.

34:37.578 --> 34:41.123
Okay, Mr. Brown. It's a deal.

34:41.353 --> 34:47.681
I'll tell you everything I'm doing.
Just close your eyes and try to relax.

34:47.849 --> 34:50.271
Relax. Okay.

34:51.018 --> 34:56.418
It's already a little numb. I'll use
some local anesthesia with bicarb.

34:58.090 --> 35:02.148
Take some nice slow breaths and think
of a place you would like to be.

35:06.313 --> 35:09.761
Good. Just let yourself float.

35:14.218 --> 35:20.197
- Do you want to tell me where you are?
- I can't. It's X-rated.

35:22.281 --> 35:24.387
Never mind, just keep it to yourself.

35:27.498 --> 35:33.281
- Okay, it's in.
- It is? Really?

35:33.449 --> 35:36.766
Oh, girl, you've got the touch.

35:38.922 --> 35:43.264
Are you sure you don't mind? If she
doesn't eat before 6, she gets cranky.

35:43.466 --> 35:47.394
- I'll be over as soon as I can.
- It's macaroni night at Magoo's.

35:47.625 --> 35:49.600
- Is that all right by you?
- Yes.

35:50.026 --> 35:54.433
Remember, no dessert
unless you eat one green vegetable.

35:54.665 --> 35:56.673
I know.

35:56.841 --> 35:59.711
My baby. He was my baby.

36:03.337 --> 36:08.487
- Why is that lady sad?
- Her son died.

36:08.682 --> 36:12.391
- Why did he die?
- He was shot.

36:12.905 --> 36:17.029
Did you take care of him like
Grandma's doctor takes care of her?

36:17.257 --> 36:18.632
Sure he did.

36:20.298 --> 36:24.967
Grandma is gonna be just fine.
Get out of here. Go eat.

36:25.161 --> 36:28.674
The last one to touch Magoo's door
has to eat two green veggies.

36:28.873 --> 36:31.295
I need your John Hancock.

36:32.617 --> 36:38.182
When Kenny Law came in, do you think
I made racist assumptions?

36:39.273 --> 36:42.983
Black folk see the world one way,
white folk see it another.

36:43.209 --> 36:44.965
All white people?

36:45.162 --> 36:48.478
When something happens, you say
it's got nothing to do with race.

36:48.681 --> 36:52.162
But for us,
it's always got to do with race.

36:52.361 --> 36:54.183
Can I have my pen back?

36:54.410 --> 36:58.916
Carter needs you, his patient's
crashing. The chili-fry lady.

36:59.753 --> 37:03.463
- Let's get her in Trendelenburg.
- She's having multifocal PVCs.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.958
- What's going on?
- Echo showed cardiomyopathy...

37:06.122 --> 37:09.438
...with wall motion abnormality.
Enzymes confirmed acute MI.

37:09.641 --> 37:12.707
- She was having a heart attack?
- She was on her way to the Cath lab.

37:12.905 --> 37:16.287
- I don't hear a BP.
- Lidocaine at a 100, IV push.

37:16.490 --> 37:18.562
I lost the pulse.

37:18.762 --> 37:20.933
Charge at 200.

37:21.833 --> 37:23.208
Hands off!

37:25.257 --> 37:28.127
- Normal sinus rhythm.
- Check her BP.

37:29.161 --> 37:34.464
15 liters of O-2 by mask.
Get a gas. That was close.

37:34.633 --> 37:36.837
BP's back. 100 systolic.

37:39.241 --> 37:42.340
Fundal placenta, no abruption.
We're in good shape.

37:42.506 --> 37:47.907
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- I haven't seen a penis yet.

37:48.137 --> 37:51.007
Are you still nauseated from
the mag sulfate?

37:51.241 --> 37:53.958
Your contractions have stopped.
Biophysical profile?

37:54.153 --> 37:58.114
Four parameters:
Breathing, tone, movement...

37:58.921 --> 38:03.591
And amount of amniotic fluid.
0 to 2 points each. This one's a 6.

38:03.817 --> 38:07.614
Oh, hello, there it is. Turtle sign.

38:08.265 --> 38:11.233
- It's a boy.
- That little thing?

38:11.433 --> 38:15.361
- They grow.
- Not as much as they'd like to think.

38:19.689 --> 38:22.275
I'm having a little boy!

38:24.905 --> 38:27.938
Acute MI. And I thought she was
a drugged-out gome.

38:28.105 --> 38:30.788
It worked out okay in the end.
How do you feel, Babs?

38:30.985 --> 38:34.465
- What?
- Not too great.

38:34.697 --> 38:37.153
You'll be fine, thanks to Dr. Carter.

38:37.353 --> 38:40.648
I never should have smoked that crack.

38:47.625 --> 38:52.197
We've got the bleeding under control.
Pressure's holding at 90.

38:52.393 --> 38:55.971
- I've dissected out the femorals.
- Not bad for some general surgeons.

38:56.169 --> 39:01.505
We'll take it from here.
Arterial and venous cannula.

39:01.705 --> 39:07.237
At least we saved one basketball player.
It was a pleasure working with you.

39:07.465 --> 39:10.498
I know you have your heart set
on a high-end specialty, Peter.

39:10.665 --> 39:15.455
But I have an opening on my team
for a good general surgeon.

39:15.657 --> 39:18.919
Not flashy.
But we still have a lot of fun.

39:21.353 --> 39:25.761
It's not ambition, Peter.
It's about healing people.

39:26.825 --> 39:30.403
Okay. Let me know
if you change your mind.

39:30.825 --> 39:32.200
Dr. Hicks...

39:34.345 --> 39:36.734
...I'd be honored.
- Good.

39:38.089 --> 39:42.344
- What?
- You'll be working with Carter again.

39:43.465 --> 39:45.288
He'll love it.

39:48.905 --> 39:51.272
- Thought you'd gone home.
- Carter wants a rematch.

39:51.465 --> 39:55.621
- Not now.
- The honor of ER is at stake.

39:55.817 --> 39:59.133
Rachel's over at Doc's with Doyle.
I'll go and check on them.

39:59.338 --> 40:04.673
Help me.
I can't take him by myself.

40:04.873 --> 40:07.939
All right. Ten minutes. No more.

40:08.137 --> 40:11.366
I called up the O.R. About Kenny Law.

40:11.593 --> 40:15.139
Whether my delaying diagnosis
would've made a difference.

40:15.337 --> 40:17.476
There was no way of knowing.

40:17.641 --> 40:22.180
But you're right. I do make
assumptions about patients.

40:22.378 --> 40:27.713
But I try to act the way I'd like the
world to be, not the way it is.

40:27.913 --> 40:31.525
Mark, you're the least cynical ER
doc I know.

40:33.513 --> 40:36.263
- Where are you going?
- Home.

40:36.457 --> 40:39.424
- You can't leave.
- I signed out.

40:39.625 --> 40:44.164
They're expecting you up at Detox.
We made a deal!

40:44.361 --> 40:47.328
Well, never trust a junkie.

40:49.289 --> 40:53.959
- He'll be back.
- Then the nurses will deal with him.

41:00.201 --> 41:02.983
