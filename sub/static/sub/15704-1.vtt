What do you want me to tell you?
I am a reserved type.

05:51.260 --> 05:52.780

in case of turbulence.

12:56.180 --> 12:58.740
I prepare for turbulence.

13:02.900 --> 13:07.620
In case of loss of pressure, the
oxygen masks are on top.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.340

14:07.700 --> 14:09.180
- Yes ...

14:16.820 --> 14:18.340
It's your second cup?

14:19.060 --> 14:20.580
We are ready to play.

14:21.140 --> 14:21.940

14:33.420 --> 14:35.780
Do not read. It's all legal.

14:37.020 --> 14:38.700
Therefore, no one reads.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.140
Did not read the terms and conditions.
Do you wish to continue?

14:44.380 --> 14:45.620
Sim.

14:45.620 --> 14:46.780
Why not.

14:46.780 --> 14:50.180
Please note that the rules stipulate
that in order to win the prize,

14:50.540 --> 14:52.900
the game has to be played

14:53.660 --> 14:56.540
Any player that disrupts
the rhythm of the game,

14:56.820 --> 14:58.580
face consequences.

14:59.340 --> 15:00.980
What are the consequences?

15:06.340 --> 15:08.860
As everyone likes to
online questionnaires,

15:09.420 --> 15:14.060
They will have to answer a
question, based on your profile.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.380
- Dave?
- Sim?

15:18.740 --> 15:20.100
You will be the first.

15:24.740 --> 15:27.580

15:28.540 --> 15:34.980
Question 1: How many goals marcaste
this season in your league football?

15:39.620 --> 15:40.100
8.

15:42.420 --> 15:44.020
No ... 9.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.220
Final anwser.

15:49.140 --> 15:53.460
Question 2: Have you had
any piercings or tattoos?

15:54.340 --> 15:58.860
Yes one. I have a
tattoo on my back.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.580
Says "sinner" in Japanese.

16:05.420 --> 16:08.220
The 3rd and final question
is an identification,

16:09.860 --> 16:12.180
Please
note the picture on the screen.

16:16.180 --> 16:18.340
You can identify
the girl in this picture?

16:20.660 --> 16:22.500
You have to think about that, is not it?

16:24.980 --> 16:26.380
Dave?

16:28.340 --> 16:33.540
The photo was taken in a
few weeks ... Who is she?

16:41.180 --> 16:44.180
I do not know ... step. Do not know.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.340
All of your answers
are incorrect.

16:55.740 --> 16:59.340
The answer to the first question is that
not marcaste no goal this season.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.540
in fact, it was banned from the game
for assaulting an opponent.

17:05.540 --> 17:09.020
... because he was asking for it.

17:11.380 --> 17:12.700
That's not very friendly.

17:14.460 --> 17:21.300
In addition to the tattoo on the back, you have
a pierced scrotum, 3 years ago.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.819
I like.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.700
- This is wrong.
- Get well.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.820
I do not think, Dave.

17:36.540 --> 17:39.980
Question 3 ... The girl
photo is Amy.

17:40.820 --> 17:43.660
A French girl,
studying in England.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.980
I met her last week,
slept with her,

17:47.660 --> 17:50.660
I have delivered it

17:55.100 --> 17:58.220
Facturaste tonight, but
today not facturaste anything.

17:59.140 --> 18:02.940
Am sorry. You're a mistake in life
and beyond.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.380
I will leave.

18:14.820 --> 18:18.020
- I is to follow.

18:19.420 --> 18:20.780
This will be good.

18:20.780 --> 18:27.500
Question 1 According to your record
as virtual alcohol babies per week?

18:34.700 --> 18:40.140
I do not know ... 20 ?. Do not know...

18:41.380 --> 18:43.140
I do not care much about it.

18:44.460 --> 18:49.260
Question 2: Have you found this profile.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.460
Can you identify
the person described here?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.100
Are you hot, girl.

18:57.820 --> 18:59.140
That little mother ...

19:00.900 --> 19:02.220
The red suits you well.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.740
Final question.

19:05.700 --> 19:11.180
4 years ago, the status of your profile, say
you've been ?? ?? offline for three months ...

19:11.860 --> 19:13.860
What was the reason?

19:30.620 --> 19:32.220
I was in rehab.

19:34.460 --> 19:41.020
I had a drinking problem ...
and put myself in rehab.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.580
I have a daughter,
she's the priority.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.700
I'm glad to have done it.

19:51.260 --> 19:52.620
Thank you Jo.

19:54.180 --> 19:57.940
Your answer to questions
2 and 3 are correct.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.380
With regard to question 1 ...

20:00.860 --> 20:04.140
Bebes 30 units
virtual alcohol per week,

20:04.700 --> 20:06.740
and more in real life.

20:07.540 --> 20:14.380
It is easier for you to forget,
to deal with real issues.

20:23.780 --> 20:26.500
Max, you are the following.

20:27.660 --> 20:31.580
Dens classical violin,
What level have attained?

20:32.260 --> 20:33.660
Dens violin?

20:36.140 --> 20:36.660
5.

20:37.660 --> 20:42.060
Question 2. What is the profile of other
more often visits?

20:45.460 --> 20:46.820
I have no idea.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.540
Of others? Do not know...

20:50.820 --> 20:54.820
We are all in "todosjuntos.com"
that's sad.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.260
Final question.

20:57.260 --> 21:02.380
What was the first thing we
bought from our site, and why?

21:03.740 --> 21:05.060
How the hell should I know?

21:06.540 --> 21:08.460
Buy a lot of things on the web,
everybody does.

21:08.940 --> 21:10.900
Allow me refresh your memory.

21:20.660 --> 21:22.020
I never bought it.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.060
What is it?

21:27.140 --> 21:28.500
I did not answer to
any question.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.060
Seriously, I never bought it.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.580
The correct answers are ...

21:33.060 --> 21:37.140
1: You're still at level 1. You
missed the examination seven times.

21:38.780 --> 21:42.060
2: The profile that you visited most,
was the Jenifer Leeps.

21:42.580 --> 21:46.300
and your photos you saw, 234 times.

21:49.420 --> 21:52.740
Question 3: Have you ordered a bottle
medication to the genitals.

21:53.300 --> 21:56.340
when did you come from Poland
and you were 17 years old.

21:57.220 --> 22:00.420
Apparently, a sick mind
like yours, attracts diseases.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.420
Well said.

22:14.180 --> 22:15.540
I did not buy.

22:18.740 --> 22:21.500
Gwen, these are your questions.

22:22.820 --> 22:26.460
Do not you think this game is
too personal?

22:27.740 --> 22:33.980
Remind them that to win the
prize, the game must be completed.

22:34.580 --> 22:38.100
Come on , already heard in
us, no?

22:39.100 --> 22:40.500
Yes, of course ... we will.

22:40.780 --> 22:42.140
Dave.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.420
Question 1.

22:46.340 --> 22:49.540
As always fascinaste you
to the world of celebrities,

22:50.220 --> 22:54.500
that famous character
compare you often?

22:56.500 --> 22:58.260
I do not know ... step.

23:00.380 --> 23:04.900
Question 2. Can you identify
the young photo?

23:12.460 --> 23:13.860
I think not.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.580
No, seriously,
I do not recognize.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.500
Question 3.

23:23.900 --> 23:28.900
- Who: Guardian Angel?
- Yeah, Gwen, who is the Guardian Angel?

23:31.420 --> 23:34.340
Me ... is my username ?? ??.

23:35.620 --> 23:38.740
Have one of three.

23:40.500 --> 23:45.940
The celebrity comparing you
is Kate Brooks, the hippopotamus.

23:46.380 --> 23:49.820
Because of your eating disorder,
when you were 15 years old.

23:50.420 --> 23:51.820
Number 2.

23:52.060 --> 23:54.260
The young man is Neal Harrys.

23:55.100 --> 24:00.140
Your page was dedicated to him,
when you were in school.

24:02.660 --> 24:05.740
I thought you were a good girl.

24:08.420 --> 24:10.140
That was long ago.

24:11.260 --> 24:12.980
3 The answer is correct.

24:13.740 --> 24:18.540
Guardian angel, is your username ?? ??
in consultation forum.

24:19.180 --> 24:20.500
You were a consultant?

24:22.940 --> 24:29.660
It was a hypocrite, because you should follow
your advice before giving them to others.

24:31.780 --> 24:33.380
Thus ends the first round.

24:33.980 --> 24:36.060
Remember we have
exciting prizes.

24:36.780 --> 24:38.380
Thank you all for playing.

24:44.420 --> 24:46.500
- Health.
- Health.

24:47.780 --> 24:49.140
Cheers.

24:49.420 --> 24:53.100
Fuck, you know it's a game.
It is only to challenge us.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.740
Let's go to the next round, to see
if you are told to shoot the water.

24:57.180 --> 24:59.460
It's nice that the prizes are good.

24:59.740 --> 25:01.620
They paid us to play.

25:02.860 --> 25:06.300
I wonder where drew
that picture. In my profile was not ...

25:07.220 --> 25:08.820
We are here to win

25:09.340 --> 25:10.660
Take another glass.

25:11.380 --> 25:13.100
They did their homework, right?

25:14.980 --> 25:21.980
Dave, let's talk about your piercing ....

25:29.700 --> 25:31.020
Shit.

25:39.820 --> 25:41.900
Yes ... I was right.

25:43.740 --> 25:48.580
- infected me with something ...
- Disgusting.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.980
And I sent get him.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.260
- All?
- O piercing.

25:55.060 --> 25:56.380
Gwen Want to see?

25:56.740 --> 25:58.060
I'm not well.

25:58.420 --> 26:00.620
- Come on ...
- So do not ask.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.220
This is good.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.020
Dave?

26:35.020 --> 26:36.980
Supposed to be clearer.

26:41.380 --> 26:42.740
It is snowing?

26:43.020 --> 26:44.620
They did not see the time?

26:47.100 --> 26:47.660
E?

26:49.500 --> 26:51.540
Supposedly the weather was clear.

26:57.620 --> 27:01.460
Sometimes they are mistaken.

27:05.820 --> 27:09.180
Please be ready.
Time for the 2nd round.

27:14.460 --> 27:15.980
Truth or lie.

27:17.060 --> 27:18.380
Good.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.260
I thought that would give food.

27:23.780 --> 27:27.860
Our millions of users
are online 24 hours a day.

27:28.660 --> 27:33.380
Share their interests, their
passions, ambitions, and dreams.

27:34.540 --> 27:37.340
For some it is a place
to take refuge ...

27:37.940 --> 27:41.700
For others it is a place
to prove.

27:44.380 --> 27:49.460
In this round, we'll find out
as we all are, indoors.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.860
God...

28:33.220 --> 28:34.580
Que caralho...?

28:38.620 --> 28:42.020
Jo, you recognize this video?

28:46.740 --> 28:48.660
Please respond verbally.

28:50.620 --> 28:51.980
Do not know...

28:51.980 --> 28:53.460
This is not true.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.340
I do not remember.

28:59.020 --> 29:00.660
To me hard to believe.

29:01.820 --> 29:04.020
Have you seen this video, for 2 months.

29:05.380 --> 29:09.020
In a Tuesday 15. Ace 22:17.

29:10.860 --> 29:12.860
and came back to see him
the next morning.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.340
At 11:53.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.420
And you sent the link
to five of your friends.

29:26.020 --> 29:28.380
I do not know ... I like to see things online.

29:28.860 --> 29:32.460
Saying your message when
the you sent your friends?

29:42.460 --> 29:45.780
- I repeat the question ...
- I do not know, by God!

29:46.380 --> 29:48.020
Let's see ...

29:53.060 --> 29:55.820
"THIS IS SECURE. SEE TO THE END"

30:01.580 --> 30:02.980
I did not send it.

30:03.580 --> 30:05.140
Who sent you?

30:06.500 --> 30:09.100
Because you sent esse video?
Or because you saw?

30:09.620 --> 30:12.380
You like to see kill a
man in front of your eyes?

30:12.860 --> 30:14.220
Of course not!

30:14.540 --> 30:15.940
But seen again, right?

30:17.140 --> 30:19.060
One and another time.

30:19.540 --> 30:21.620
Just I was curious,
thought it was fake.

30:23.060 --> 30:26.500
Do not look at me as if they had never
seen these things. All we do!

30:27.420 --> 30:28.780
What game is this shit anyway?

30:29.620 --> 30:31.100
This is not very nice friend.

30:31.620 --> 30:32.940
We will not play anymore.

30:32.940 --> 30:35.220
If in doubt,
they lose the prize.

30:36.020 --> 30:37.500
All prizes.

30:38.220 --> 30:39.540
The choice is yours.

30:40.220 --> 30:42.580
If you want to play,
I just.

30:47.420 --> 30:49.140
- Gwen.
- Sim?

30:50.940 --> 30:52.540
Do you recognize this?

30:55.420 --> 30:59.820
Recently did
a test like this.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.540
Yes it is?

31:03.060 --> 31:06.100
This test is called:
What kind of lover are you?

31:07.500 --> 31:10.340
So ... What kind of lover are you?

31:12.940 --> 31:14.740
Yes ... tells us.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.180
- I repeat the question.
- Its not good.

31:19.820 --> 31:24.100
I think the test said
I was a lover, sadistic.

31:27.100 --> 31:30.100
Already knew, typical of caladinhas.

31:35.300 --> 31:38.700
It was just a stupid test, something
I did just to pass the time.

31:39.980 --> 31:43.820
The test was wrong?
Was not?

31:46.940 --> 31:49.740
I'm not that sadistic,
if that's what you mean

31:50.380 --> 31:54.460
Your answers gave this result,
but lied in parts, right?

31:57.380 --> 32:00.580
I do not know ...
I did not take it very seriously.

32:01.460 --> 32:04.180
Was the question 4.
Do you remember?

32:06.940 --> 32:08.300
No of course not.

32:08.620 --> 32:12.500
It was ... How many people
you've slept?

32:14.260 --> 32:16.060
This does not concern you.

32:16.580 --> 32:22.940
It does not concern me? And yet you have
posted on your profile?

32:25.900 --> 32:30.500
Are you happy with people to believe that
you are like that, but you're afraid to tell the truth.

32:32.580 --> 32:38.220
- How many people have you slept?
- I said, that does not concern you.

32:39.660 --> 32:41.700
I bet you say that you're a bitch.

32:44.500 --> 32:45.860
Let me help you ...

32:48.220 --> 32:50.580
You acedes many forms ...

32:51.820 --> 32:55.500
But in this enter 5 of
to 15 times a week.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.180
Virtual reality.

33:03.100 --> 33:06.100
Your avatar is a character ...

33:06.620 --> 33:08.660
and your username ?? ?? is Cherry Bomb.

33:09.620 --> 33:14.900
So? Cherry Bomb, how many
people have you slept?

33:20.420 --> 33:21.740
None.

33:27.460 --> 33:29.100
As you know all this?

33:29.860 --> 33:33.380
All we hide behind our
?? ?? usernames, our Avatars ...

33:33.940 --> 33:41.180
But wherever they go, that they may see, discharge,
or say online ... is saved.

33:41.980 --> 33:45.660
An information track, available
for those who wish.

33:46.860 --> 33:52.380
In fact we have records of all the sites
they visited in recent months,

33:53.180 --> 33:55.220
and we made surprising discoveries.

33:56.460 --> 33:58.740
They can not do that. This
information is protected.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.220
Let's see how protected are you?

34:04.060 --> 34:05.380
Dave?

34:05.380 --> 34:09.100
2 days, you visited a Japanese site.

34:10.940 --> 34:16.219
The content of these
videos, is depraved and degrading ...

34:16.739 --> 34:20.940
Some are: "Two girls and a horse."

34:22.780 --> 34:25.300
"Too young to run"

34:25.300 --> 34:27.060
"Bukake para 4"

34:29.940 --> 34:31.260
Continuous?

34:34.699 --> 34:38.940
Please respond verbally.
Continuous?

34:39.179 --> 34:39.900
Not!

34:47.460 --> 34:48.780
I do not...

34:49.219 --> 34:52.699
You have considered the ages of the
girls in the videos, Dave?

34:53.580 --> 34:57.580
You thought that?
Or visit them only for that?

34:59.260 --> 35:03.700
Can you tell us the title that
you saw 4 times in the same night?

35:09.660 --> 35:10.980
I do not remember.

35:10.980 --> 35:14.980
Of course not, but
then they come to mind.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.620
They are flashy.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.460
It is a global network.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.900
and I have the right to do
what I want.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.140
I'm not a pervert.

35:40.700 --> 35:44.380
- Max, you see porn, right?
- I do not target it.

35:46.540 --> 35:47.860
God...

35:49.980 --> 35:51.820
- I bet you see.
- you do not even know me.

35:52.380 --> 35:55.420
Lie! All done things
we should not. All!

35:57.380 --> 36:00.540
And who says no, mind.

36:07.860 --> 36:09.220
Shit.

36:13.740 --> 36:16.220
- Shit for this.
- What are you doing?

36:17.220 --> 36:18.620
I'll talk to the pilot!

36:20.620 --> 36:23.740
Who's there?
Who's flying this ...?

36:24.180 --> 36:25.580
Open the fucking door!

36:26.180 --> 36:30.740
- Open the fucking door!
- Please go back to your place.

36:31.260 --> 36:33.420
Fuck you!
I do not want to sit!

36:34.300 --> 36:37.460
- Open the door!
- Return to your place ...

36:38.140 --> 36:39.540
This is your last warning.

36:41.100 --> 36:42.780
Open the door! Let me in!

36:43.380 --> 36:46.860
I said let me in. If you're in
there ... Let me in.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.700
Closed!

36:51.140 --> 36:52.580
Why do not you answer?

36:53.100 --> 36:56.020
As Dave fouled, and
ignored my instructions,

36:56.580 --> 36:58.940
I have no other option
than starting a punishment.

36:59.740 --> 37:02.780
A punishment? That fear ...
I think I'm the matter?

37:03.180 --> 37:04.500
I will not play anymore.

37:05.460 --> 37:09.500
All Dave's friends will be
selected in your list of friends.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.020
What are you doing?

37:22.220 --> 37:23.580
Rory?

37:23.940 --> 37:27.660
We will visit your friend Rory ...

37:29.260 --> 37:30.620
come on, we are at ease!

37:32.540 --> 37:33.940
Good...

38:34.140 --> 38:35.500
My God.

38:35.700 --> 38:37.460
No, this is not serious.

38:38.660 --> 38:40.020
To me it seemed very real.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.740
Rory must be to kill her laugh.

38:43.420 --> 38:45.980
As you know? It seemed real.

38:46.580 --> 38:52.340
It's just a Reality ?? program ?? TV. There are millions
of people watching us right now.

38:54.860 --> 38:57.460
Now that the punishment is
completed, back to the game.

39:04.140 --> 39:05.780
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

39:06.740 --> 39:08.900
Max! Will CHÃ‚TEA-los.

39:10.020 --> 39:11.700
You're fun-you, Max?

39:13.060 --> 39:14.860
Is blocked.

39:17.300 --> 39:21.540
Max fouled while trying to
contact people outside the game.

39:22.100 --> 39:24.340
How can you break the rules?

39:25.300 --> 39:27.780
I was in the terms and conditions.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.020
Shit.

39:30.620 --> 39:34.260
I'll have to start another punishment.

39:34.780 --> 39:37.180
No, please. No more.

39:38.540 --> 39:41.140
Max, you have to lose a friend.

39:42.220 --> 39:43.580
My God.

39:46.540 --> 39:48.300
We will choose the Max.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.420
Probably not you will notice.

39:52.540 --> 39:53.940
Asks you excuse.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.220
Let's see.

39:56.620 --> 39:58.300
These are your friends!

40:00.420 --> 40:03.220
Do not stand there,
do something!

40:03.860 --> 40:06.220
Say something. Asks
excuse ... Wait!

40:08.260 --> 40:12.300
I had to try to do something.
Contact someone, right?

40:12.820 --> 40:15.220
Why do not you write
a formal complaint?

40:15.620 --> 40:17.460
Shut up! We're in trouble!

40:17.860 --> 40:20.540
Trouble? It is a crocodile who speaks!

40:21.140 --> 40:27.420
Max, you violated the rules. It's
time to visit your friend, Allan.

40:41.980 --> 40:43.380
What is this...

41:19.980 --> 41:21.300
Bastardo.

41:26.940 --> 41:30.820
I assure you that what they have just
seen is real.

41:32.340 --> 41:35.900
Infringe the rules again, and they
assure you kill anyone else.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.660
It's time to play.

41:39.580 --> 41:43.260
You killed an innocent man
in cold blood for no reason!

41:44.660 --> 41:49.100
I do not agree. Implicaste the
friends when infringiste rules.

41:49.660 --> 41:53.500
and will continue to kill
if they follow the same path.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.940
Thank you for your kind cooperation.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.580
They think it was fake?

42:04.700 --> 42:06.060
Do not know...

42:07.780 --> 42:09.740
God ... Lake Casino.

42:11.300 --> 42:14.100
We in Ireland, we should not be
here. We should be over the Atlantic.

42:14.980 --> 42:16.380
What does it mean?..

42:16.380 --> 42:18.500
That our destiny is not New York.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.420
What are you doing?

42:25.500 --> 42:26.900
Max?

42:27.940 --> 42:29.300
Do not touch anything.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.820
- He can see you.
- Because this monitor does not work?

42:33.780 --> 42:36.020
Please do not touch anything.
Leave it.

42:37.300 --> 42:38.700
Please tell him ...

42:40.020 --> 42:41.820
Please let it.

42:54.820 --> 42:56.220
I think this is the display
of information.

42:56.780 --> 42:59.380
Will tell us where
it comes to electricity.

43:04.060 --> 43:07.940
We should not do this.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.220
I already have.

43:19.340 --> 43:20.740
It's on.

43:21.380 --> 43:22.740
What the fuck?

43:23.140 --> 43:25.100
We're not going to New York.

43:26.460 --> 43:29.180
What? Where are we going?
Norway?

43:29.620 --> 43:31.340
Go to Oslo.
What is there?

43:33.260 --> 43:34.820
Because we are doing this?

43:35.420 --> 43:37.060
- I do not think this is serious.
- What are you saying?

43:38.060 --> 43:39.460
This can not be them.

43:39.980 --> 43:41.700
What do you think,
that all this is legitimate?

43:42.140 --> 43:45.060
- Have you talked to the co-pilot?
- This is a competition!

43:46.180 --> 43:48.380
You think that a social network
goes around killing people?

43:49.820 --> 43:51.220
I have to get to the pilot.

43:52.540 --> 43:55.540
There are people killed
for having infringed the rules.

43:56.020 --> 43:59.180
We will continue to play
that no one else gets hurt.

43:59.980 --> 44:03.100
They can not kill everyone. I have
over 1000 people on my profile.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.900
Hold up!

44:05.340 --> 44:09.180
Ladies and gentlemen ...
please sit down.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.460
We arrived at the 3rd round.

44:14.180 --> 44:20.820
Why the hell are flying
to Oslo?

44:22.380 --> 44:27.980
Max relaxes you.
You've been a bad boy.

44:28.540 --> 44:30.300
They will know everything in due time.

44:31.020 --> 44:33.700
Not! Let's not play this game anymore!

44:35.380 --> 44:40.380
Very well. Leave me no option
than to initiate a new punishment.

44:42.140 --> 44:43.500
Let's see ...

44:44.540 --> 44:46.060
Lament!

44:47.180 --> 44:49.260
Sit in your seats.

45:05.860 --> 45:07.220
"DO OR DIE".

45:08.220 --> 45:10.100
Each will have a task.

45:10.740 --> 45:13.940
If you do not meet,
more people died.

45:15.260 --> 45:18.660
Eliminate taste with your friends
if necessary,

45:19.140 --> 45:20.460
or your family.

45:23.900 --> 45:26.180
And if we do not play more?

45:26.740 --> 45:28.060
Do not tease!

45:28.420 --> 45:33.860
Finally, Jo, take a good
decision. It is better later than never.

45:35.860 --> 45:39.860
Jo, please
go to the diary room.

45:42.060 --> 45:46.660
A little joke,
please go to the bathroom.

45:47.460 --> 45:48.500
Alone.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.500
Senta-te.

46:19.260 --> 46:22.100
Put the headset.

46:31.740 --> 46:34.700
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

46:36.420 --> 46:38.180
I'll give you a job.

46:39.300 --> 46:43.660
If you say to your
companions, or speak in the task,

46:44.420 --> 46:47.220
your daughter Sophie, die.

46:50.260 --> 46:51.620
Bastardo!

46:52.740 --> 46:54.740
My God ...
This is live?

46:55.500 --> 46:56.860
Tell me!

46:58.860 --> 47:01.820
- This is live?
- Yes, I want to wake up?

47:01.820 --> 47:04.100
Not! Please do not touch it.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.020
What happened?

47:54.060 --> 47:56.140
I told you?

47:56.500 --> 47:59.140
That said?

48:00.260 --> 48:03.700
Dave, please
go to the bathroom.

48:23.180 --> 48:25.220
Put the headset.

48:25.220 --> 48:26.980
and sit down.

48:37.660 --> 48:40.220
I have something very special for you.

48:42.900 --> 48:45.660
- And why would I do it ...
- Because I said.

48:46.300 --> 48:48.220
Would you break his arm?

48:50.340 --> 48:52.900
- Sarah.
- Senta-te.

48:56.140 --> 49:00.220
- Can not hear you, Romeo.
- Damn you.

49:00.860 --> 49:02.580
This is crazy.

49:02.860 --> 49:04.260
This is crazy.

49:04.260 --> 49:09.540
I know this is very difficult, but I want you to
think the consequences of your actions.

49:09.540 --> 49:13.220
Why do decide
to Sarah will live,

49:13.460 --> 49:14.820
or die.

49:37.380 --> 49:38.660
Que?

49:38.660 --> 49:40.020
What's up?

49:43.700 --> 49:47.980
Gwen, you is seguinte,

50:11.540 --> 50:13.420
Not!

50:13.780 --> 50:15.140
Not!

50:17.740 --> 50:19.100
My God!

50:23.260 --> 50:26.300
- No.
- Sit down.

50:31.860 --> 50:34.940
It is time to
take the advice of others,

50:34.940 --> 50:37.180
... so I suggest you listen well.

50:39.300 --> 50:42.420
Say die burned
is an agonizing death.

50:44.220 --> 50:45.540
For.

50:47.500 --> 50:49.220
Please, stop.

50:49.980 --> 50:52.300
Please, stop.

50:52.540 --> 50:57.300
I allow her to live to
complete a simple task.

51:18.620 --> 51:19.940
Whatever it is that
you are spending.

51:19.940 --> 51:21.700
We should keep us together.

51:25.020 --> 51:27.260
We can not let
this kind in defeat.

51:30.020 --> 51:32.780
Max, your turn.

51:38.340 --> 51:39.100
Or.

51:41.660 --> 51:43.540
Just go.

51:55.060 --> 51:58.540
I have a special mission for you.

51:58.540 --> 52:02.460
If you do not fulfill it will be the
death of your brother Mike.

52:02.460 --> 52:04.700
Do not kill me, please.

52:43.220 --> 52:46.300
Now that each of
you has its own task,

52:47.180 --> 52:49.980
It has 45 minutes
to complete.

52:52.740 --> 52:56.820
As you know, this plane
is directed to "Oslo"

52:57.340 --> 52:59.180
where your journey will end.

52:59.180 --> 53:03.260
When embatermos all together
at the headquarters of "todosjuntos.com".

53:04.500 --> 53:08.420
We will all die, along
with everyone in the building.

53:11.500 --> 53:14.620
This is not real,
this is just a game

53:14.620 --> 53:16.980
That must end.

53:17.660 --> 53:19.420
Listen, crazy.

53:19.620 --> 53:21.220
This joke will end now!

53:21.500 --> 53:24.340
- OK?
- On the contrary, Dave

53:24.340 --> 53:27.780
This joke will start now

53:29.260 --> 53:31.420
Estamo us to enjoy?

53:31.820 --> 53:34.220
- Max Please
- let me.

53:36.900 --> 53:38.220
Please,

53:40.180 --> 53:42.220
Do no harm to my baby

53:42.580 --> 53:45.820
- What will happen to her?
- Nothing can save you now.

53:46.780 --> 53:49.900
But you have the opportunity to
save your loved ones

53:49.900 --> 53:52.660
If talk of tasks, die!

53:53.020 --> 53:55.820
Fail the mission, and die!

53:56.060 --> 53:59.820
Complete your tasks
and live.

54:01.780 --> 54:04.260
Everyone has your instructions.

54:06.740 --> 54:08.180
Do what he said.

54:08.420 --> 54:11.060
- We will do what ...
- Why me?

54:11.060 --> 54:13.220
I do not know what I did?

54:17.980 --> 54:19.860
What did he say to you?

54:20.060 --> 54:22.940
Please,
I can not talk to you.

54:23.540 --> 54:24.940
He does not tell me anything.

54:25.300 --> 54:28.580
No, no,
we can not talk about it.

54:28.580 --> 54:31.420
I told not to speak of the task.
What did I say to thee?

54:31.420 --> 54:36.500
- Nothing, nothing ...
- I do not believe.

54:36.740 --> 54:41.140
- How to get out of here.
- Shut up.

54:48.300 --> 54:49.500
Damned.

54:49.500 --> 54:50.820
He told me where he was.

54:50.820 --> 54:55.620
I can not do what he asked me,
I have to cut it.

54:57.980 --> 55:00.180
Cameras, microphones,
get away from me.

55:00.940 --> 55:02.420
Sit down now!

55:02.420 --> 55:04.140
Unless we can see or hear,

55:04.140 --> 55:05.500
the game will end.

55:05.940 --> 55:09.100
Just think of you.

55:09.100 --> 55:12.220
Sit or just you.

55:12.620 --> 55:14.340
The task ... I can not do it.

55:15.340 --> 55:19.540
Sebes what he told me? I kill
who he says,

55:19.540 --> 55:21.020
and when he wants.

55:21.780 --> 55:24.620
Do not you see? You do not want to kill us.
He wants us to punish.

55:26.060 --> 55:28.900
You think you will let live loved ones
if you follow the instructions?

55:30.300 --> 55:34.260
- You're an idiot Dave.
- We can not do anything.

55:35.140 --> 55:37.740
We have to do what he says.

55:38.500 --> 55:41.580
- I do not.
- Yes, Max.

55:42.100 --> 55:46.500
Puts the ax,
back to your place.

55:46.940 --> 55:51.180
Otherwise someone else
will suffer for your stupidity.

55:52.660 --> 55:55.860
Your brother Mike.

56:00.100 --> 56:02.340
Put that shit now.

56:04.820 --> 56:06.700
Long-a.

56:14.220 --> 56:15.700
Shit.

56:24.020 --> 56:27.380
I did?
Please get me out.

56:30.940 --> 56:31.700
No, no

56:59.900 --> 57:03.860
If you cut the other arm,
die in minutes.

57:04.100 --> 57:07.380
You are soon to dismiss you?

57:07.380 --> 57:09.620
I'm not who you think.

57:09.980 --> 57:12.500
Whoever this person
is not my brother, do not do.

57:12.500 --> 57:14.340
It's the truth, listen to me.

57:14.740 --> 57:17.980
I do not have siblings.

57:17.980 --> 57:23.180
I will not do anything you tell me.

57:24.580 --> 57:26.780
- Do you hear me?
- Would you like to sand us?

57:26.780 --> 57:28.100
Max.

57:29.580 --> 57:32.020
NÃ£o sou o Max

57:32.500 --> 57:35.500
- Fuck you.
- Why do you think I could not play?

57:36.140 --> 57:39.180
I look like a violinist?
I should not even be here.

57:39.180 --> 57:40.700
We saw your name on the list,

57:41.180 --> 57:43.300
and saw your PROFILE.

57:44.340 --> 57:46.220
Max is a student.

57:46.220 --> 57:49.860
I walked into his account at "todosjuntos.com"
changed the details and all the numbers.

57:51.220 --> 57:53.820
I thought I discovered at the airport
but even searched me.

57:53.820 --> 57:57.380
I expect us to believe you
after what just happened?

57:57.380 --> 58:00.020
Believe what you want Dave,
just tell you the truth

58:00.500 --> 58:03.060
- Who are you?
- I think I'll tell you this?

58:03.900 --> 58:04.660
Calm.

58:08.100 --> 58:09.740
Calm down everyone.

58:09.740 --> 58:11.580
Who the hell are you?

58:11.900 --> 58:13.220
If I tell you,

58:13.220 --> 58:14.860
My friends will be in danger,

58:14.860 --> 58:16.180
And my family.

58:16.180 --> 58:17.900
And then we?

58:17.900 --> 58:19.500
They have my sister.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.580
That does not interest you, I suppose.

58:21.580 --> 58:24.300
Stupid.

58:25.220 --> 58:29.580
Fuck you, you will die
like us, asshole.

58:30.140 --> 58:32.020
You think I'm involved?

58:33.700 --> 58:36.260
If you want to believe in you,
you have to prove who you are,

58:36.500 --> 58:37.620
one way or another.

58:38.100 --> 58:40.580
If you will not tell us,
show us.

58:41.740 --> 58:43.980
Empty your pockets now.

58:57.660 --> 58:59.540
And the passport.

59:18.180 --> 59:19.740
Tell me the truth.

59:20.700 --> 59:22.780
Are you happy?

59:23.780 --> 59:25.980
Stupid shit.

59:27.660 --> 59:29.860
I'll take it for now.

59:36.580 --> 59:39.020
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to pee.

59:51.060 --> 59:53.700
He said not to face Dave

59:53.700 --> 59:56.380
However,
they spend their lives talking.

59:56.860 --> 59:58.700
I did what you asked me.

59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.820
I have a passport

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.260
Its identity
and its details.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.820
It's not Max,
it's someone else.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.700
A mysterious guest.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.180
Now he's in the game.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.020
Damn disgusting.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.540
Do not touch it.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.980
Do not touch it.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:32.060
I will not leave here alive.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.980
You showed aptitude in your task,

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:06.420
... but this is normal
because cheating is your strong.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.900
Right then...

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.100
You're gonna let her go, right?

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.500
I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid you
can not do that.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.380
I have another task for you.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.500
I want you to kill one of the
other passengers.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.820
She did not have much time.

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:39.380
I give you three minutes.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.820
It's ok.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.420
Who want to kill?

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.100
- What happened?
- It 's been over six minutes

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:16.500
Dave...

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.620
- No, no
- I have to do it.

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.700
- Dave!
- I have to do it.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:26.220
You do not have to do this.

01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.380
Please put that
please, please.

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:31.940
Take you out of my front.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:34.060
Damned

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:45.340
- Please, stop.
- Time is running out, Dave.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.780
Damned.

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.660
- No, no!
- For.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.220
What have you done?

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.260
What happened?

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.300
He would not stop.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.660
He would not stop.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.060
I would not stop.

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.660
Damned.

01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:59.860
Thank you for playing the game.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.380
Kills or dies. Now
begun to understand.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.220
Unfortunately, Dave has failed
its mission, and so

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.460
Sarah has died.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.980
My God!

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.420
She died for nothing,

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:28.060
... he died for nothing.

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:47.860
Puts the earphones

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.060
Places them!

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.420
I could not do what you asked.

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.660
I could not do what you asked.

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.500
Died.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.660
Yes I saw, Gwen,
but do not worry

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.820
I give you another task.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.380
You must seduce Max.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.660
Help me get him out.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:07.140
We can not leave it like that.
I can not look at it.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:11.180
You see.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:21.180
Let's clean this up, Max.

01:09:26.779 --> 01:09:28.260
This son of a bitch.

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.660
He killed her anyway.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.779
Take it out.

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.779
Beware!

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.540
It keeps you quiet.

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:02.220
My God!

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:16.140
Damned.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.460
Take it easy.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.060
I think we're gonna die on this plane?

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:47.380
Do not know.

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.980
Perhaps.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.500
Sim.

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.540
What are you doing?

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:22.060
Please, help me.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:26.020
If you do not,
my sister dies.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.980
I can not let that happen.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.860
- What is it? What is it?
- You can access to the equipment here.

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:13.100
- Please.
- No, my laptop is in the bag.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.780
Inside the case there is a computer

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.620
Can I access the web
over the network.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.940
- So what?
- Ask for help.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:22.820
Find out who the
holds hostages

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.540
enter the cockpit of shit.

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.900
Your task is not complete.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.660
I tried...

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.820
I Tried.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:43.340
He can not get to
the luggage compartment.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.100
Holds it.

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.700
You have three minutes or Emily will die.

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:04.940
What about you? He can
see or hear everything they do.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.620
You do not have to involve you.

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.100
But I have to do something.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:13.820
- Get out of the way.
- no, no, no, please

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.180
2 minutes.

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.300
Gwen failed its mission.

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:53.660
If Max had behaved,

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:57.700
... I would not have to kill your sister

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.420
Come on , Jo
're losing or show.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.780
I thought you liked these things.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:16.340
You may prefer to
be a little younger.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.220
What's your problem?

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.100
I'm just giving you the mirror.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.020
It is better that you look upon it as well.

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.460
After all.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.020
All have their hands
stained with blood.

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:45.260
No, please do not do that.

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.700
It is only way to see
my daughter, please do not.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.060
I have to go to the compartment
of the luggage.

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.380
I have to get her out,
I can not leave her.

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.300
Help me.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.180
Grab-a.

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:11.380
Shit.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.740
Shit.

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.020
What is this?

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.060
What's that smell?

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.180
- It is the sister of Max.
- What?

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.340
Why?
It can not be.

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.220
We saw recordings.

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.340
My God, he killed them.

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.140
He killed them.

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.300
My God!

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:50.580
Bastard.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.060
Shit.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.660
I already have ...

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:05.460
Sophie!

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.700
C'mon C'mon.

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:17.820
Sim...

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:22.620
Allow access.

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.020
- Sophie!

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.540
Let's see if this works ...

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:34.220
Sophie!

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:37.660
Sophie!

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.380
Sophie!

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:52.540
My baby.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.140
Not!

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:02.660
My God!

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.460
He killed my mother.

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:13.380
What is the address?

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:20.900
We'll be fine.

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:28.900
We'll be fine,
it is not so sure.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:32.220
Give me the computer.

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:44.140
Bastard!

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:49.260
Do not move, motherfucker.

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:52.100
Quem is you?

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.060
Nobody.

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:57.500
I'm just the pilot.

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:01.140
I swear to God.

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:04.620
Because broke my laptop?

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:11.460
- I just do what they tell me.
- Who? Who told you?

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.380
- Crocodile.
- Who is it?

01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:14.940
Do not know.

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.020
I did not see his face ...

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.300
Do not know.

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:22.500
Do not know.

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:27.100
He's lying.

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.980
What do you know crocodile?

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:48.380
I have my family.

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:54.180
My wife,

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.180
and my son.

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:01.620
I got home yesterday ...

01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.980
... they were not.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.140
Vi disorder.

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:15.020
It was bad.

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.380
Then I received the message.

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.060
What message?

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.820
Do not let live.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.940
He told me he would kill them both,
if I did not do what he wanted.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:37.900
I could not let that happen.

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:42.140
I can not let that happen.

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.780
Just I do what
I have to do.

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:50.940
He killed my mother.

01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:53.660
Killed everyone,
are all dead.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.900
You need to land this plane,
please.

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:03.740
If take the seat of the site,
will kill more innocent people.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:13.220
People die every day,
but not my family.

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:14.940
Please,
he's crazy.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.340
God knows what will make us.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:18.980
What about him?

01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:30.140
I'm sorry.

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:52.900
10 minutes to or impact.

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:57.140
The question is: Are you going to listen
to Jo poisoner,

01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:01.580
or return to the commands and
save your wife and your son?

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.980
Not hear.

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:06.380
- Please please!
- What dies first?

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:11.980
- The wife or child?
- He's killed them all.

01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:15.340
- See for yourself
- Go back to the cabin now.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:18.140
Or your wife will die.

01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:24.460
Now, go back to the cabin
or cut off his head.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:28.060
Not hear.

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:29.380
Do not.

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:57.780
Want you to see this video again,

01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.820
...before I die.

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:08.180
I thought that at least one of
you to remember.

01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:11.020
A little sorry at least.

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:17.220
- But I would ask them a lot.
- "All over now I will not be deceived"

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:23.580
I remember that he committed suicide.

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:25.900
Lucy Turner,

01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.500
15 years old.

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.180
You were there.

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.940
Everybody were.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:35.100
In line
observing the occurrence.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:41.780
All commented, Gwen
with his sermon only made worse.

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:46.620
A hypocrite hiding
behind your religion.

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.940
- Dave, almost ridiculizou his agony,

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:56.460
and when he decided to publish,

01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:00.300
... Rury the friend felt
compelled to comment.

01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.620
This kid had a big mouth.

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:07.180
It is much quieter now.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:12.380
Then there was Max,
posting it on 30 sites.

01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:19.420
So skilled with his hands.

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.220
You did not kill the Max

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:30.940
You killed the wrong, crazy person.

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.980
No, Jo

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:38.580
You killed the wrong person.

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:42.380
But do not worry, I
'll find the real Max,

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.940
logo.

01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:46.220
He will also suffer.

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:49.260
Now, where were we?

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.700
Alan found very funny.

01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:00.020
Everyone was involved,
but you Jo,

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:03.340
remember what you did?

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.740
Apenas olhaste.

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:10.340
- You like to see.
- I was drunk.

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:13.540
Your excuse for everything,
for pregnancy,

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.380
Your excuse for life
miserable and pathetic that you bear.

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.180
But still you have sat
to watch my daughter die.

01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.580
- What have you done with my daughter?
- You do not deserve a daughter.

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:25.620
All you had to do
was press the panic button.

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:29.220
- You killed my mother.
- All of you are guilty.

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.180
It has the pilot's family
and will kill more innocent people,

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:37.540
- who are not guilty.
- Some are an unfortunate necessity,

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:40.820
but "todosjuntos.com" company
is guilty, like the rest of you.

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:43.500
They swept the floor
with my daughter Lucy

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.460
and they destroyed a service
of the people.

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:47.980
There will be nothing,

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:49.740
and the world will see its end.

01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:54.020
- This will get their attention.
- No one will want to know.

01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:59.620
No one will want to know any of this,
and nobody wants to know.

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:01.220
You're wrong again, Jo.

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:06.060
I'm doing the best video ever
in which you are the star.

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.300
Of course any relationship
with my identity,

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.980
will be removed before the world
was gladiar to see you die,

01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:15.220
one and another time...

01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.100
Eye for an eye, my dear.

01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:20.860
Why my daughter?

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:25.620
Please, she's all right?

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.060
I'm afraid not.

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.900
I tore his beautiful face.

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:35.020
I do not believe,
you are a liar.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:36.700
She screamed for you.

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:39.020
- I thought you never shut up.
- You're a liar.

01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:40.700
Jo also have a family,

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:41.980
Like you.

01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:43.540
We were very busy.

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:45.420
Busy bees.

01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:48.700
damn monster.

01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:53.900
This is the way to honor
the memory of your daughter?

01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:00.780
Ever wonder
why your daughter committed suicide?

01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:06.380
With a father like you
who would not?

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:10.340
Six minutes to the collision.

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:13.540
Goodbye, Jo

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.340
Government information
say,

01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:21.460
a private jet crashed
at sea off the coast of Norway.

01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:25.980
It seems that the plane was flying too low
when the cabin lost pressure ...

01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:31.580
It seems that the event took
place on Flight 665

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.540
They have found more bodies
in the rubble,

01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:37.140
which confirms that the spread of the
video after the fact was genuine ...

01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:42.780
- 2 million visits in the video ...
- "todosjuntos.com" responds to accusations ...

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:45.980
The search was canceled.

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:50.340
While the alleged killer
remains a mystery.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:03.740
Hello Lucy.

01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:07.500
- How are you today?
- My name is Sophie.

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.860
No, your name is Lucy.

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.780
Lucy.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.140
Maybe I should
formally introduce.

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:23.460
My name is Robert Turner

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.620
Comes...

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:31.580
There are people who
want you to meet.

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:09.540
Hello Lucy.

01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:12.620
I Am Aniee.

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.540
Ed comes to greet your sister.

01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:32.020
Now, we'll give you a bath ...
