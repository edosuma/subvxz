00:13.940 --> 00:17.940
Argh!

00:54.920 --> 00:56.990
Amy? Amy?

00:59.580 --> 01:00.690
Dad?

01:00.740 --> 01:03.930
- Have you seen Shun?
- What? - He's taken the car somewhere.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.650
Well, he's not in my room, obviously.

01:05.700 --> 01:09.610
- I'm going to tell your mother about
my suicide... - Yeah. - .. attempt.

01:09.660 --> 01:12.810
Erm... I'm planning on taking
her away for the evening

01:12.860 --> 01:15.290
and I want to do it like that.
Do you think that's a good idea?

01:15.340 --> 01:18.490
- Yeah, probably.
- She's very angry with me.

01:18.540 --> 01:20.610
Maurice! I am waiting to have this talk!

01:20.660 --> 01:22.570
Thanks for your help.

01:22.620 --> 01:26.620
Yep, just coming!

01:27.180 --> 01:28.850
I think it's a fucking terrible idea.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.770
It's a really nice hotel.

01:30.820 --> 01:34.820
We can relax and then... we can talk.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.890
Why can't we just talk here?

01:36.940 --> 01:40.940
I really feel like we could do with
getting out of here for the evening.

01:43.180 --> 01:46.090
Get some space. Have a conversation.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.490
About what? I thought I
was difficult to talk to.

01:49.540 --> 01:53.410
Er... about, well, us and... me.

01:53.460 --> 01:54.730
And me.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.650
Yes. About you, yeah.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.570
- I don't think this is working.
- Pardon?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.850
- I don't think this is working.
- Right, yeah.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.530
I think it would've sort
of been easier to cope with

02:04.580 --> 02:06.550
if it was just that you were gay.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.470
Yeah, sorry.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.210
I mean, is Shun even back with
the car? Cos I'm not spending

02:10.259 --> 02:11.730
hundreds of pounds on a taxi.

02:11.780 --> 02:13.410
No, but I'm sorting it.

02:13.460 --> 02:16.050
Erm... that reminds me, actually,
I should probably tell you,

02:16.100 --> 02:20.100
there was one time when Shun did
sort of try to give me a hand job.

02:20.420 --> 02:23.970
But I'm almost a 100% certain
that he just misunderstood what

02:24.020 --> 02:28.020
I was asking for, so in
the spirit of honesty...

02:29.660 --> 02:33.660
Er...

02:46.820 --> 02:50.820
Good morning!

03:01.180 --> 03:04.250
Thank goodness she's not some smelly
boyfriend. This is much better.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.650
Is it too much, do you think?

03:05.700 --> 03:07.250
No, I like the harmonies.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.970
Maybe just one step at a time.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.890
Don't want to be like your dad was.

03:10.940 --> 03:14.890
"Stop writing me things,
you mad bastard!" I get it.

03:14.940 --> 03:16.810
Means he liked you, at least.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.850
Yeah.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.410
What I wouldn't give to be you, right now.

03:22.460 --> 03:26.460
This is the best bit.
Just before it all happens.

03:27.700 --> 03:31.610
And then slowly it all just... disappears.

03:31.660 --> 03:34.010
So make sure you enjoy it.

03:34.060 --> 03:38.060
I've got to get your dad
in the fucking car now.

03:39.060 --> 03:43.060
Have a nice time.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.370
The Albatross.

03:45.420 --> 03:49.620
I'm trying to build the
world's first flying car.

03:52.060 --> 03:55.290
She's a beaut, ain't she, Dad?

03:55.340 --> 03:56.930
Does it still drive?

03:56.980 --> 04:00.980
- D'you mean on the ground?
- Mmm. - On the ground, yeah.

04:01.260 --> 04:05.260
Do the wings... come off easily?

04:05.900 --> 04:09.900
Not really, no. I boosted the
joins with my best super goo.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.450
- D'you ever think about finding a different hobby?
- Calling.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.649
I mean, obviously, if you did invent
a flying car, that would fantastic.

04:20.700 --> 04:24.700
But erm, it's an extremely
hard thing to achieve.

04:28.580 --> 04:30.490
Hmm.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.570
Donald, can I ask you a favour?

04:32.620 --> 04:34.890
Can you keep an eye on
your sister while I'm away?

04:34.940 --> 04:38.940
I think she's in a bit
of a strange way again.

04:39.660 --> 04:41.850
I'm... I'm just asking for your help.

04:41.900 --> 04:45.010
- Do you want me to wipe her arse as well, then?
- Um, no.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.210
D'you not know what a
rhetorical question is?

04:48.260 --> 04:49.530
I thought you were an author.

04:49.580 --> 04:53.580
Oh, wait... you're not.
Because you were fired! Twat!

05:00.020 --> 05:04.020
OK, what about if Billy and
Bella Grubb are make competition

05:04.220 --> 05:05.890
for building skyscraper?

05:05.940 --> 05:09.690
- But Mrs Grubb get very angry because much too tall.
- You're embarrassing yourself.

05:09.740 --> 05:12.410
Shun, every other illustrator
that's worked with Maurice

05:12.460 --> 05:14.450
has quit because he's so difficult.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.330
He's moody, he's inconsistent
and he's stubborn.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.370
There are loads of other
projects you could work on.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.850
Why are you so determined to save Grubbs?

05:22.900 --> 05:26.130
OK, maybe a little bit different angle.

05:26.180 --> 05:29.290
Grubbs family making friends
with very small mouse.

05:29.340 --> 05:32.050
Sneaky one. Very naughty boy!

05:32.100 --> 05:35.850
Scootchy-koochie-koochie-koo!
Naughty one. What's he doing?

05:35.900 --> 05:38.100
Naughty little mouse!

05:39.820 --> 05:43.610
Abigail, come in.

05:43.660 --> 05:47.660
- You look lovely.
- Oh, thank you.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.780
- Yes, Maurice and I have suddenly decided we're heading out for the day, so...
- Oh, that's nice.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.250
Hmm. I'm so proud of you both.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.970
Feel free to do whatever you like
up there. We're very relaxed.

05:59.020 --> 06:03.020
Erm... You don't happen to have any
friends suitable for Donald, do you?

06:04.340 --> 06:08.250
- Not... suitable for Donald, no.
- OK.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.370
Where's my beautiful gay daughter?

06:10.420 --> 06:13.410
I think she's about to have
one of her seven daily shits.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.890
Mid-morning sesh takes her good half hour.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.330
I just think you should
know this kind of... detail,

06:18.380 --> 06:20.090
before you make your final decision.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.930
Shame you didn't plump for yours truly.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.450
I'm more experienced, of course.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.690
I've already had one
and a half girlfriends.

06:25.740 --> 06:29.740
The only relationship Amy's
ever had is with a frog.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.570
Why are you moving away?

06:34.620 --> 06:38.620
Lots of reasons really, but
mainly to do with my dad

06:38.980 --> 06:42.980
and his job and... I guess
he's a bit over-protective.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.650
Are you dumping me?

06:45.700 --> 06:49.490
We have only been on one date.

06:49.540 --> 06:53.540
Does he think I'm not good enough for you?

07:05.660 --> 07:09.660
That's me two years ago.

07:10.580 --> 07:13.370
Look, my dad and I have
spent a lot of time

07:13.420 --> 07:15.890
working out a better regime for me...

07:15.940 --> 07:19.940
keeping up with my kundalini
and gazing, some anal breathing.

07:20.300 --> 07:24.300
And I'm sort of worried that if
I mess with it, I might relapse.

07:26.860 --> 07:30.860
I need something a little quieter.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.490
And Donald said this would be
kind of like your first time

07:34.540 --> 07:38.540
and it's... just a little intense for me.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.570
'I'll get more work elsewhere.'

07:48.620 --> 07:51.250
We're making the right decision.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.690
I think I can forgive you.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.970
And I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

07:56.020 --> 08:00.020
And I'm sorry for calling you a fat
pig-slut maniac with no moral compass...

08:00.660 --> 08:04.090
and for smashing up the house
and forfeiting our deposit.

08:04.140 --> 08:07.650
I was scared, Abigail, about losing you.

08:07.700 --> 08:11.700
And for your sake... that you might
fall from such exquisite grace.

08:16.220 --> 08:19.530
- Fucking Donald!
- Why is this making such a ridiculous noise?

08:19.580 --> 08:21.330
I think it might be running out of petrol.

08:21.380 --> 08:24.290
I can't see the fuel gauge cos
he's stuck an altimeter on it.

08:24.340 --> 08:27.080
I'll find somewhere to fill up.

08:37.860 --> 08:40.530
Fuck this family! Fuck this house!

08:40.580 --> 08:42.169
Hey! Stop it! What are you doing!

08:42.220 --> 08:44.610
- What did you say to her?
- I just told her the truth.

08:44.660 --> 08:46.970
It's not my fault if she
doesn't like you enough, is it?

08:47.020 --> 08:49.410
- What is that?
- You don't see me crying. I loved her as well.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.570
What does it even fucking
do? It's a toilet brush!

08:51.620 --> 08:55.250
- I don't know yet!
- Fucking waste of life. NOTHING!

08:55.300 --> 08:57.890
You and dad are both exactly the same...

08:57.940 --> 09:01.170
moping about in your pants like
you're superior to everyone.

09:01.220 --> 09:04.290
Well, you're not. I hate
you and I fucking hate Dad!

09:04.340 --> 09:08.340
You're both selfish, arrogant,
pretentious mard-arses.

09:08.500 --> 09:12.500
- IT'S PATHETIC!
- Dad tried to hang himself, you IDIOT!

09:13.940 --> 09:15.810
Ye... We...

09:15.860 --> 09:18.890
GOOD!

09:18.940 --> 09:20.730
Oh, that's probably why
he didn't tell you.

09:20.780 --> 09:24.490
Why don't you just fuck off and leave then,
instead of talking about it the whole time?

09:24.540 --> 09:27.970
- Fine, I will.
- Go on, then.

09:28.020 --> 09:32.020
- I'm going.
- Good.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.250
Bitch!

10:16.940 --> 10:18.850
I love sweating... don't you?

10:18.900 --> 10:22.900
All the toxins and the
negativity just pouring out.

10:22.980 --> 10:24.530
Getting pure again.

10:24.580 --> 10:28.580
Mmm-hmm. It's, er, really nice.

10:32.660 --> 10:36.660
Ooh! Is it safe that hot?

10:44.180 --> 10:47.010
You smell absolutely incredible.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.890
Do I?

10:48.940 --> 10:50.170
I'm boiling.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.490
It's fantastic.

10:52.540 --> 10:56.530
Beads of you are evaporating into
the air and flying up my nose.

10:56.580 --> 10:58.930
I'm in a cloud of Abigail.

10:58.980 --> 11:00.850
I think we might have to engage

11:00.900 --> 11:04.900
- in some psycho-spiritual conflict resolution.
- Ooh!

11:05.060 --> 11:06.260
Mmm!

11:08.940 --> 11:10.450
Fuck off, pot!

11:10.500 --> 11:14.500
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.930
Abigail! I know you love me.

11:24.020 --> 11:28.020
Abigail!

11:28.740 --> 11:31.690
Oh, oh!

11:44.540 --> 11:48.540
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

11:49.380 --> 11:52.090
- Aaarrrggghhh!
- Argh!

11:52.140 --> 11:55.010
You want us to be friends because
you're going out with your dad?

11:55.060 --> 11:57.730
Except he's not my dad.

11:57.780 --> 12:00.730
- We're passionate lovers.
- We've been having a bit of a rocky patch,

12:00.780 --> 12:02.130
but we've worked through it now.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.010
Why do you have to pretend to be her dad?

12:04.060 --> 12:06.330
I need to have the freedom
to maximise my client base.

12:06.380 --> 12:09.250
Part of the sale is my sexual magnetism.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.970
It's just a stupid excuse so
that he can shag other women.

12:12.020 --> 12:15.850
No, no. It's not. Abigail,
she's foxing you. Be strong.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.930
- Can you not see that he's an idiot?
- Quiet, lago!

12:18.980 --> 12:22.090
Look, Amy. Sometimes I get confused.

12:22.140 --> 12:25.450
- Yes. That's right.
- Or I don't have a strong sense of who I am.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.500
- Exactly.
- So I try and fill the void in myself with someone else.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.900
And even though you did make me feel...

12:36.700 --> 12:40.700
.. complete, that's not
the same as being in love.

12:41.340 --> 12:45.340
Isn't it?

12:45.980 --> 12:48.090
Show's over, little lesbian.

12:48.140 --> 12:52.140
I'm her sexual destiny. Not you.

12:56.060 --> 12:58.000
Fucking hell.

13:08.220 --> 13:11.330
Can I ask, is this really a Scotch egg?

13:11.380 --> 13:15.380
Because its shape is, sort
of, well, not like an egg.

13:17.140 --> 13:20.530
Well... it's a Scotch egg-ish.

13:20.580 --> 13:23.410
Right, so it's a, sort
of, meat and egg powder?

13:23.460 --> 13:26.410
Yeah.

13:26.460 --> 13:30.460
Right, thanks, and 20 Fishermen's, please.

13:32.660 --> 13:36.660
Right.

13:41.380 --> 13:45.380
Here you go.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.970
Deborah! Deborah! Deborah!

13:51.020 --> 13:52.770
Deborah, I bought you tea!

13:52.820 --> 13:56.820
I got you a cup of tea, Deborah!

14:02.660 --> 14:04.730
Here we go.

14:04.780 --> 14:06.850
OK, back on track.

14:06.900 --> 14:10.090
Scotch egg?

14:10.140 --> 14:11.490
Fair enough.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.370
Save yourself for a nice meal.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.810
Can you just... hold this?

14:15.860 --> 14:17.250
Thanks.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.130
Let's get to this...

14:19.180 --> 14:20.930
Oh, sorry.

14:20.980 --> 14:24.980
.. beautiful hotel.

14:37.140 --> 14:41.140
How can I help you to stop being so sad?

14:49.340 --> 14:53.340
I'm just having a bit of a dark period.

14:57.340 --> 15:00.130
OK, well, how long will
this dark period last?

15:00.180 --> 15:03.050
Because it's getting,
frankly, quite boring.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.850
I know, I'm trying.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.410
Well, whatever you're doing,
it's not working, is it?

15:09.460 --> 15:11.530
So we need to find something else,

15:11.580 --> 15:14.890
maybe go and see a doctor, perhaps.

15:14.940 --> 15:16.690
I can't...

15:16.740 --> 15:19.450
I can't really explain it.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.010
Could you try?

15:22.060 --> 15:26.060
Because if I don't know what's
going on with you, I can't help.

15:29.860 --> 15:33.730
And I love you, Maurice...

15:33.780 --> 15:37.780
.. but I used to be quite a
happy person before I met you.

15:41.420 --> 15:45.420
It's like...

15:48.980 --> 15:52.980
It's like an invisible monster
with no shape, no form,

15:54.180 --> 15:58.180
but it's loud and fierce
and it never ends.

16:02.740 --> 16:05.130
Right, OK. I mean, is that...

16:05.180 --> 16:08.970
Is that the clearest way you
can think of to explain it?

16:09.020 --> 16:11.570
I'm trying, I'm sorry.

16:11.620 --> 16:15.290
No, right, it's OK.

16:15.340 --> 16:19.340
So how do we defeat this monster?

16:20.260 --> 16:24.260
- We can't.
- There must be some way.

16:24.660 --> 16:28.660
All monsters have a weakness.

16:31.980 --> 16:34.730
Maybe it's love.

16:34.780 --> 16:38.780
Maybe love is how we defeat
this monster together.

16:40.940 --> 16:44.940
Love makes it worse.

16:54.540 --> 16:58.170
Actually, erm... Do you mind
if I have a quick cigarette?

16:58.220 --> 16:59.690
I...

16:59.740 --> 17:01.210
Sorry, I just feel a bit...

17:01.260 --> 17:03.930
Obviously, I want to carry on, but...

17:03.980 --> 17:07.980
Sorry, I'll just be a second.

18:06.340 --> 18:09.650
Shun, we've been talking for eight hours.

18:09.700 --> 18:12.930
OK, one more thing.

18:12.980 --> 18:16.850
One second.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.900
Please.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.850
What is this?

18:25.900 --> 18:28.930
This is my village.

18:28.980 --> 18:32.410
My favourite image for remember my house

18:32.460 --> 18:35.410
before big earthquake is coming.

18:35.460 --> 18:38.090
My little sister... "Do-do-do!"

18:38.140 --> 18:39.970
.. run along very happy.

18:40.020 --> 18:44.020
I am on the train to
karaoke festival in Yokohama

18:44.700 --> 18:46.650
and suddenly I hear

18:46.700 --> 18:48.690
a big earthquake.

18:48.740 --> 18:51.570
Thinking, "Oh, such a shame!"

18:51.620 --> 18:54.170
Then discover my village
is place for earthquake.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.970
Oh, my God.

18:56.020 --> 18:59.170
Turn around. Run fast as I can.

18:59.220 --> 19:02.250
Searching, searching. Under
this rock, maybe under this rock.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.610
"Excuse me, where is my family?!"

19:04.660 --> 19:07.330
Can't find anywhere.

19:07.380 --> 19:11.380
And finally I'm looking in
a little hole and I see...

19:13.100 --> 19:17.100
Ah, this is my little sister Aiko Chan...

19:18.340 --> 19:21.410
.. but half squash

19:21.460 --> 19:24.330
and so I discover

19:24.380 --> 19:28.380
my whole family completely squash.

19:28.740 --> 19:32.570
So never mind.

19:32.620 --> 19:36.210
Get little apartment in town

19:36.260 --> 19:40.170
and I'm very miserable, of course...

19:40.220 --> 19:41.770
nothing left.

19:41.820 --> 19:45.770
No money, just tiny bread for eating.

19:45.820 --> 19:49.570
And for keep warm, I'm go to book shop

19:49.620 --> 19:52.730
and discover, "What is
this little strange book?"

19:52.780 --> 19:56.010
Funny picture. Have a look.

19:56.060 --> 19:58.850
It's Japanese version of Grubb.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.650
And reading very strange story,

20:01.700 --> 20:05.700
Acorn Conundrum, Swamp
Dragon, Fungus Brain.

20:05.860 --> 20:09.010
Who is this person writing this book?

20:09.060 --> 20:11.890
It's Mr Flowers.

20:11.940 --> 20:14.970
I think, "Ah, Mr Flowers!

20:15.020 --> 20:18.250
"You are know how I am feeling",

20:18.300 --> 20:22.300
because I need to see that
miserable is happen, you know?

20:23.540 --> 20:27.540
Difficulties happen, this
is world. You can survive.

20:28.180 --> 20:31.850
Grubb always survive.

20:31.900 --> 20:35.900
So I'm write Mr Flowers letter,
probably terrible English.

20:36.140 --> 20:40.140
I come to England and
I'm illustrator for you.

20:41.980 --> 20:45.490
Mr Flowers save my life.

20:45.540 --> 20:49.540
This is why I want to save Grubb.

21:01.460 --> 21:05.250
I'm sorry, it's still a no.

21:05.300 --> 21:09.300
Please.

21:10.620 --> 21:14.620
In Japan, if this kind of situation,

21:15.180 --> 21:18.170
normally say, "Yes."

21:18.220 --> 21:21.730
- Well, we're not in Japan.
- Yes, I know not Japan, Mr Carroll.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.780
Everybody eat so much butter
... drive me completely mad!

21:26.060 --> 21:28.050
Thank you for your time.

21:28.100 --> 21:31.450
Very kind you are.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.900
Arigatou gozaimasu

22:06.860 --> 22:09.810
"I got the idea for this invention

22:09.860 --> 22:13.090
"because my sister sometimes gets very sad

22:13.140 --> 22:17.140
"and I wanted to invent something
to make her more happy."

22:17.740 --> 22:21.740
"I'm always happy, so I created
the Happiness Machine to take

22:23.940 --> 22:27.940
"the happiness from my head
and put it into Amy's."

23:26.100 --> 23:30.100
Amy!

23:34.860 --> 23:37.130
Why is your hand bleeding?!

23:37.180 --> 23:40.490
- I'm trying to learn how to ride a bike.
- What?!

23:40.540 --> 23:44.540
Why?

23:45.500 --> 23:48.650
- I'm sorry.
- Help me, then.

23:48.700 --> 23:52.700
- What do you want me to do?
- Give me a push.

23:53.340 --> 23:57.340

- Yeah.

24:00.140 --> 24:02.890
- I need a proper push!
- I gave you a proper push.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.770
Look...

24:05.820 --> 24:09.820

- Yeah.

24:14.780 --> 24:18.780
OK, let go, let go!

24:21.980 --> 24:24.450
"A thousand years upon this land.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.130
"The maiden blood of your frail hand

24:27.180 --> 24:30.010
"has mingled with these twisted roots.

24:30.060 --> 24:33.450
"My mangled trees of crooked youth.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.170
"And though we are an age apart,

24:36.220 --> 24:39.370
"Penelope, we share a heart.

24:39.420 --> 24:41.970
"You galloped through this heathen wood,

24:42.020 --> 24:44.810
"the hallowed path to womanhood.

24:44.860 --> 24:48.130
"And though the angry tribe gave chase,

24:48.180 --> 24:51.210
"they couldn't match your savage pace.

24:51.260 --> 24:53.250
"They cowered at your fearsome howl

24:53.300 --> 24:56.290
"as you escaped this forest foul.

24:56.340 --> 24:59.210
"Across the ancient holy bridge

24:59.260 --> 25:02.290
"to claim your earthy privilege.

25:02.340 --> 25:06.340
"And though I am a dismal freak,
it doesn't mean that I am weak.

25:06.740 --> 25:08.970
"It doesn't mean I can't be free

25:09.020 --> 25:13.020
"as you, my brave Penelope."

25:16.940 --> 25:18.970
Go on, Amy!

25:19.020 --> 25:23.020
Keep going!

25:29.700 --> 25:33.700
