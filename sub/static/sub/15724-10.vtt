WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:02.631
I think I can help.

00:02.785 --> 00:05.466
You want to build yourself
a nuclear bomb, a deadly virus,

00:05.628 --> 00:06.885
it's there on the net.

00:07.046 --> 00:08.595
Maybe he's part of a team.

00:08.756 --> 00:12.099
They were trying to establish whether
terrorists could build a smallpox virus

00:12.260 --> 00:13.517
using the Internet.

00:13.678 --> 00:15.227
You let him walk away scot-free.

00:15.388 --> 00:16.980
That's aiding and abetting.

00:17.144 --> 00:19.565
- Some people might even say treason.
- You threatening me?

00:19.930 --> 00:22.192
Heard my conversation.

00:22.353 --> 00:24.612
- Where is he?
- They're still working on him.

00:24.790 --> 00:25.693
What happened?

00:25.843 --> 00:27.933
They were attacked
by some bear they were studying.

00:28.099 --> 00:30.492
<i>All I've read about Dr. Turnbull
will be worth the trip.</i>

00:30.653 --> 00:33.328
We've been studying ways
to repair optic nerve damage.

00:33.489 --> 00:34.538
Am I a candidate?

00:34.796 --> 00:38.167
You'll have to decide whether
you're willing to risk total blindness.

00:40.134 --> 00:41.939
- Molly.
- Hey, Uncle Wes.

00:42.445 --> 00:43.456
Hey, kid.

00:46.027 --> 00:47.384
Your niece is pregnant.

00:51.276 --> 00:53.804
- She's 12.
- I know.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.273
Molly, how's your dad doing these days?

00:58.424 --> 00:59.855
He's been good.

01:00.241 --> 01:02.510
Has he... Has he been around a lot?

01:05.599 --> 01:07.488
- Do you have a boyfriend, Molly?
- No.

01:07.949 --> 01:09.371
Dad's real strict.

01:11.611 --> 01:13.202
Is it really bad?

01:13.853 --> 01:16.163
How come you haven't said anything?

01:20.742 --> 01:21.835
You're pregnant.

01:23.872 --> 01:25.255
I'm serious.

01:25.621 --> 01:27.758
- That's not funny.
- I know it's not funny.

01:29.011 --> 01:30.719
But the doctor says you're pregnant.

01:31.922 --> 01:33.466
I can't be pregnant.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.432
I've never even had sex.

01:35.593 --> 01:38.181
Can you think back about eleven weeks?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.641
End of July, beginning of August.

01:42.090 --> 01:43.415
I was at summer camp.

01:45.264 --> 01:46.494
Did someone...

01:48.175 --> 01:50.840
Do you know what
the word "molested" means?

01:51.181 --> 01:52.480
You mean, like,

01:52.985 --> 01:54.243
was I raped?

01:56.198 --> 01:58.580
- No, Uncle Wes.
- Because the thing is that,

01:58.741 --> 02:01.792
there needs to be a boy
for you to get pregnant.

02:01.953 --> 02:05.520
- What about the virgin birth?
- You mean, like Jesus Christ?

02:06.961 --> 02:08.779
Oh sweetheart, that's a...

02:09.435 --> 02:11.510
That's a story in the Bible.

02:13.398 --> 02:15.305
I'm having God's baby.

<i>Haliburton County has issued a travel
advisory after the latest bear attack.</i>

03:53.326 --> 03:55.664
<i>This morning's incident comes
on the heels of last week's</i>

03:55.828 --> 03:57.194
<i>mauling of 2 researchers,</i>

03:57.372 --> 04:00.285
<i>which left one dead and the other
in stable condition...</i>

04:02.136 --> 04:03.161
Peach,

04:03.866 --> 04:06.541
banana-blueberry smoothie, I think.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.586
D'joo know...

04:09.872 --> 04:12.127
Honey, don't talk, okay?
Don't talk.

04:13.271 --> 04:16.050
So the doctor says
that your prognosis is good.

04:17.060 --> 04:18.250
More attacks.

04:20.259 --> 04:21.680
Yeah, I know. I...

04:22.459 --> 04:24.646
I heard on the radio
this morning.

04:24.824 --> 04:27.562
They think there's too many bears.
They're going to have to cull.

04:27.944 --> 04:29.474
We thought it was...

04:30.267 --> 04:31.525
meningeal worm.

04:32.959 --> 04:34.968
You mean,
like in White Deer?

04:36.048 --> 04:37.237
Yeah, when...

04:39.206 --> 04:40.325
moose get it they go

04:40.969 --> 04:42.254
crazy and...

04:44.540 --> 04:47.546
We thought it had
transferred onto the bears.

04:47.751 --> 04:48.751
But...

04:49.391 --> 04:51.712
Didn't pan out.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.214
Could be habitat encroachment.

04:57.545 --> 04:58.917
There are other...

04:59.314 --> 05:00.694
People out there.

05:04.043 --> 05:05.683
Mom, don't let it happen...

05:05.888 --> 05:07.394
Don't let it happen again.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.658
I won't.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.520
- Hey. How'd it go?
- How'd what go?

05:35.738 --> 05:37.300
With the meeting with the new doctor.

05:37.464 --> 05:40.375
She explained the
nanotrellis operation. It can help me...

05:40.648 --> 05:42.767
- theoretically.
- What do you mean theoretically?

05:42.918 --> 05:45.807
It's an experimental procedure.
Never been performed on a human before.

05:47.073 --> 05:48.206
If it fails,

05:48.493 --> 05:51.021
I'll lose what little sight I have left.

05:51.182 --> 05:54.065
- Then, Bob, you're not gonna do it.
- This is the main lab, Molly.

05:54.426 --> 05:56.531
- I gotta go.
- It smells really weird in here.

05:56.709 --> 05:59.975
Yeah, I know. It took me
a while to get used to it too.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.282
I feel really sick.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.327
You wanna lie down?

06:05.961 --> 06:08.914
No, I mean I'm gonna be sick.

06:10.841 --> 06:12.542
Get your ass up here, now!

06:12.703 --> 06:14.887
Do you want me to take
you to the washroom?

06:15.140 --> 06:17.313
That'd be great.
Molly, this is my friend, Mayko.

06:17.518 --> 06:19.664
- Mayko, this is my niece, Molly.
- Yeah, go.

06:19.843 --> 06:22.219
Here, come with me. I'll get
you some water or ginger ale.

06:36.613 --> 06:37.818
You misplace your keys?

06:38.226 --> 06:39.486
Look what I found.

06:42.244 --> 06:43.364
It's a bug.

06:44.854 --> 06:47.204
- Yeah, I know what it is, David.
- It was in my laptop.

06:47.396 --> 06:49.329
My fucking laptop, Wes.

06:49.490 --> 06:52.290
So my question to you is:
What are you gonna do about it,

06:52.451 --> 06:54.148
Mister Head of Security?

06:57.661 --> 06:59.256
I'll have your little lab swept.

07:00.326 --> 07:03.677
And put scramblers on all the landlines
and make some noise in Washington.

07:03.838 --> 07:05.582
It doesn't matter, David.

07:06.730 --> 07:07.769
This...

07:08.015 --> 07:10.065
is a prehistoric piece of shit.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.894
If the big boys wanna listen to you...

07:13.195 --> 07:15.190
- They're gonna fucking listen...
- Wake up, Wes!

07:15.382 --> 07:17.274
We're not making fucking playdough here!

07:17.596 --> 07:20.316
Now get
your fucking security act together!

07:33.833 --> 07:35.391
How's... Craig doing?

07:35.678 --> 07:37.974
Yeah, you know, all things
considered, he's pretty good.

07:38.151 --> 07:39.600
He's good. Thanks.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.426
I really wanna figure out what's
going on with these bears in Algonquin.

07:44.587 --> 07:47.804
They've been acting weird for months.
Craig's got some interesting theories

07:47.965 --> 07:50.974
I'm really not that interested
in bears right now, Rachel.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.243
Yeah, this thing could environmental.
It could be bacterial. It's...

07:54.455 --> 07:56.021
I just need Bob for, like, a day.

07:56.182 --> 07:58.217
- I can figure this...
- I know he's your son,

07:58.409 --> 08:02.345
but Bob and I are about to start
something really big right now, sorry.

08:02.522 --> 08:04.860
You selfish bastard! Jesus, David!

08:05.188 --> 08:06.072
Excuse me?

08:07.553 --> 08:08.553
Here...

08:08.743 --> 08:10.076
Wanna see something?

08:10.237 --> 08:12.120
Here, take a look at that. Okay?

08:12.281 --> 08:13.486
That's my son.

08:14.241 --> 08:18.251
That's my fucking son, in case you don't
recognize him with his face hanging off!

08:18.761 --> 08:21.296
And that's what's left of his
partner, Tom, okay?

08:23.599 --> 08:24.638
Shit.

08:31.308 --> 08:34.476
You... you do what you need to do.

08:36.392 --> 08:39.813
I'll talk to Bob.
If there's anything I can...

08:40.929 --> 08:42.275
Do for you, let me know.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.388
Thank you.

08:52.468 --> 08:55.475
So how long are you gonna be
visiting your uncle Wes?

08:55.652 --> 08:56.896
I don't know.

09:01.913 --> 09:03.061
Here you go.

09:03.813 --> 09:05.876
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:11.194 --> 09:13.515
Have you ever had a baby?

09:13.749 --> 09:14.761
No.

09:15.212 --> 09:17.269
No, not yet. I hope to someday.

09:18.150 --> 09:19.627
When you're married?

09:20.153 --> 09:21.171
I don't know.

09:21.335 --> 09:25.203
I mean, I don't have to be married.
I just wanna be in love.

09:27.696 --> 09:28.708
You...

09:29.910 --> 09:33.286
You don't think God would be mad
at you if you weren't...

09:33.765 --> 09:35.036
Married?

09:36.444 --> 09:38.071
No, I don't think so.

09:46.106 --> 09:49.728
<i>What we're seeing is part of a worldwide
phenomenon in the animal kingdom.</i>

09:49.905 --> 09:51.428
<i>Elephants, rhinoceroses,</i>

09:51.589 --> 09:54.583
<i>even humans attack when they feel their
territory is being encroached upon.</i>

09:55.271 --> 09:57.997
<i>It's as though animals are learning
an aggressive behaviour.</i>

09:58.175 --> 10:00.648
<i>How can I put this?
They're becoming better killers.</i>

10:14.998 --> 10:15.910
<i>Look better.</i>

10:16.133 --> 10:17.431
A little colour.

10:18.976 --> 10:20.152
I been crying.

10:22.256 --> 10:23.835
Tom's parents called.

10:25.153 --> 10:26.379
Nice people?

10:27.490 --> 10:29.632
His funeral was today.

10:33.286 --> 10:34.967
They said I'd always be

10:35.240 --> 10:36.921
a part of their family.

10:38.015 --> 10:39.476
I'm glad. That's good.

10:42.443 --> 10:44.124
You were close, you two.

10:48.963 --> 10:51.136
You have friends like that...

10:51.851 --> 10:53.560
It's rare, it's hard to come by.

10:53.711 --> 10:56.618
Fuck, you are something else.

10:58.207 --> 11:01.206
He wasn't my friend, Dad. He was...

11:01.692 --> 11:02.799
my partner.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.120
My lover.

11:07.938 --> 11:11.216
Now he's dead, you stupid fuck.

11:14.936 --> 11:16.057
I'm sorry.

11:19.232 --> 11:20.272
I'm s...

11:21.297 --> 11:23.689
Goddammit, I'm gonna get you a nurse.

11:25.165 --> 11:26.731
You shouldn't even be here!

11:28.800 --> 11:29.811
Nurse!

11:32.476 --> 11:33.476
Nurse!

11:39.187 --> 11:40.759
- Eliot.
- Where's Molly?

11:40.964 --> 11:44.255
She's upstairs in my office.
Slow down. We need to talk about this.

11:44.446 --> 11:46.537
What's there to talk about?
That bastard raped her.

11:46.715 --> 11:49.667
- You don't know that for sure.
- Look, just let me see my daughter.

11:49.859 --> 11:52.647
Okay, just, please calm down.
She's scared enough as it is.

11:52.824 --> 11:53.931
I am calm.

11:55.871 --> 11:57.679
Which way is it, left or right?

11:59.630 --> 12:01.975
<i>Honestly, I was surprised
that he was interested.</i>

12:02.143 --> 12:04.268
- Thanks for setting this up.
- Setting up a meeting

12:04.418 --> 12:06.729
with our investor is one thing,
convincing him to allow

12:06.890 --> 12:09.357
- the procedure to happen...
- I just need 5 minutes.

12:09.623 --> 12:10.662
Let's go.

12:15.332 --> 12:17.871
Dr. Sandström, I'd like to introduce you
to Titus Muyerbridge,

12:18.021 --> 12:20.370
from Auflander Docheimer Industries.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.172
Pleasure, Dr. Sandström.

12:24.262 --> 12:25.261
Yeah.

12:25.605 --> 12:28.486
- You know each other?
- Well, we haven't met face-to-face.

12:28.636 --> 12:32.391
But I believe the last time we spoke,
you were threatening to expose my what?

12:32.541 --> 12:33.761
"Big soggy diaper"?

12:34.520 --> 12:35.597
Please.

12:36.697 --> 12:38.848
I have to admit I'm somewhat perplexed

12:38.998 --> 12:41.311
by your interest
in Dr. Turnbull's research.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.148
You claim you don't believe
in fast-tracking science

12:44.298 --> 12:46.274
or leaping over protocol,
but here you are.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.696
My colleague, Dr. Robert Melnikov,

12:51.846 --> 12:54.949
- is going blind.
- She briefed me on your situation.

12:56.190 --> 12:59.770
Very good. I need you then
to grant permission to Dr. Turnbull

12:59.920 --> 13:03.730
to proceed with Dr. Melnikov
as her first human subject.

13:03.907 --> 13:06.336
Then the question is one of ethics.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.159
Do we proceed
when we're not really ready?

13:09.309 --> 13:10.812
Dr. Melnikov is in full agreement.

13:10.962 --> 13:13.963
He understands the risks
associated with the procedure.

13:14.113 --> 13:17.180
I'm offering you a chance here
to ramp up your research. Okay,

13:17.330 --> 13:19.547
fuck the hamsters and the guinea pigs.

13:19.697 --> 13:21.263
I'll give you a human subject

13:21.413 --> 13:24.103
and I'll give you NorBac
for peer review and oversight.

13:25.444 --> 13:26.564
Dr. Turnbull?

13:27.910 --> 13:30.193
I think
that the gains outweigh the dangers.

13:30.391 --> 13:32.880
Especially where research is concerned.

13:33.030 --> 13:34.197
Come on, Titus.

13:35.097 --> 13:38.522
We're talking
potential billions here for you guys

13:39.196 --> 13:41.835
and I think
I've squirmed enough for you today.

13:42.188 --> 13:45.667
Not nearly, Dr. Sandström. But who am I
to stand in the way of science?

13:47.015 --> 13:48.024
Now...

13:49.882 --> 13:51.727
If this is a complete failure,

13:51.877 --> 13:54.259
Auflander Docheimer
will not be connected to this

13:54.692 --> 13:55.701
in any way.

13:56.821 --> 13:57.841
Agreed?

14:01.591 --> 14:03.059
Yeah. Sure. Agreed.

14:03.797 --> 14:05.561
Then I believe we're in business.

14:10.001 --> 14:12.186
Carlos, this is my brother, Eliot.

14:12.336 --> 14:15.154
- Nice to meet you, Eliot.
- And this is my niece, Molly.

14:16.065 --> 14:17.074
Hi, Molly.

14:18.761 --> 14:20.159
- Have a seat.
- Sure.

14:21.753 --> 14:22.774
Thank you.

14:31.024 --> 14:32.513
Molly's pregnant.

14:33.013 --> 14:35.127
I sent her to a summer bible camp.

14:35.277 --> 14:38.277
Turns out it's run by some pervert
by the name of Father Justin.

14:38.427 --> 14:39.554
- He's not.
- Molly.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.055
He never touched me!

14:42.468 --> 14:44.142
Can you tell us what happened, Molly?

14:44.795 --> 14:46.477
- Nothing.
- What do you think happened?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.229
Wes.

14:49.293 --> 14:51.660
Maybe I should wait outside
and you can talk about it.

14:51.810 --> 14:54.068
No, we've talked about it.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.447
That's why I asked you.
We were hoping you could do a DNA test.

14:57.669 --> 14:58.807
Here.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.035
I yanked these off that bastard's head.

15:02.726 --> 15:05.917
And the next time I see him,
I'm gonna yank something else off him.

15:06.140 --> 15:09.292
Can you get some DNA from the baby?
Can you even do an amnio at 11 weeks?

15:10.338 --> 15:14.344
Yeah, we can do
a CVS, a Chorionic villus sampling.

15:15.531 --> 15:17.569
Can I speak to you outside a moment?

15:17.827 --> 15:18.634
Excuse me.

15:19.454 --> 15:20.803
I'll take these.

15:25.662 --> 15:27.603
That wasn't too painful was it?

15:28.821 --> 15:29.994
It'll be okay.

15:32.131 --> 15:34.248
Are there
other male counsellors at camp?

15:34.398 --> 15:36.965
Maybe, I don't know,
a boy's camp nearby?

15:37.115 --> 15:39.211
No, her camp was
in the middle of nowhere.

15:39.361 --> 15:42.658
Girl counsellors. The only male
was this fundamentalist preacher.

15:45.459 --> 15:49.123
You think we could do a physical exam
to see if she really is a virgin?

15:51.829 --> 15:53.852
- Wes, she had sex.
- She's 12 years old.

15:54.006 --> 15:55.380
She's pregnant!

15:56.043 --> 15:58.007
Where's her mother in all of this?

15:58.667 --> 16:01.253
Probably strung out, somewhere in L.A.

16:04.042 --> 16:06.474
You think that we can just
keep this between the two of us?

16:07.070 --> 16:08.079
Of course.

16:08.654 --> 16:11.411
I should bring Mayko in
for the analysis.

16:12.608 --> 16:14.273
- Fine, but nobody else.
- No.

16:23.264 --> 16:25.220
They caught the bear
that attacked Craig.

16:25.370 --> 16:27.059
- Organs are on their way.
- Okay.

17:03.431 --> 17:06.387
Okay, Molly,
this is just so we can take a look.

17:15.949 --> 17:17.281
There is a baby!

17:17.651 --> 17:18.921
Yes, there is.

17:19.559 --> 17:20.568
Molly,

17:22.368 --> 17:24.721
- did Father Justin...
- No, he didn't.

17:25.601 --> 17:26.633
Well, honey...

17:27.330 --> 17:29.759
I mean, there it is. Somebody did it.

17:31.741 --> 17:32.766
Yeah...

17:34.373 --> 17:35.382
Who?

17:38.496 --> 17:39.505
Molly...

17:40.770 --> 17:43.491
- God put the baby there.
- Swab, please.

17:45.295 --> 17:47.205
Okay, this is gonna feel a little cold

17:47.355 --> 17:48.442
against your tummy.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.077
There.

17:51.293 --> 17:53.134
Transcervical tube please.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.696
- Daddy, I'm scared.
- Oh, it's okay, sweetie.

17:58.563 --> 18:01.130
Now we have to do this
so we can find out how this happened.

18:02.174 --> 18:05.905
Molly, I want you to look at your dad
and take a deep breath in for me, okay?

18:08.467 --> 18:09.511
Good girl.

18:10.191 --> 18:11.716
You're very brave.

18:14.438 --> 18:17.772
Well, the heart appeared
completely normal and healthy.

18:18.211 --> 18:21.234
That's both lungs,
spleen and heart. Nothing.

18:21.384 --> 18:23.399
No sign of parasitic infestation.

18:23.587 --> 18:24.625
Stomach?

18:25.024 --> 18:25.931
I don't know.

18:26.081 --> 18:28.157
Looks completely healthy and normal.

18:29.259 --> 18:31.318
A few undigested bones.

18:32.655 --> 18:34.368
Some berries.

18:35.147 --> 18:37.212
Appear to be cranberries.

18:38.531 --> 18:39.540
And...

18:40.573 --> 18:41.734
What's this?

19:35.030 --> 19:36.238
My boy.

20:03.910 --> 20:05.524
Did you guys run the tests?

20:05.864 --> 20:06.714
Twice.

20:07.327 --> 20:08.132
And?

20:11.133 --> 20:13.763
Come on, I didn't sleep last night.
Is the reverend the father?

20:14.640 --> 20:16.564
Let's go talk in your office.

20:23.972 --> 20:24.981
Hey, Bob.

20:25.814 --> 20:26.846
Hello, David.

20:28.764 --> 20:29.653
What's wrong?

20:29.968 --> 20:31.005
The news.

20:32.084 --> 20:34.051
Did you hear about the man in Maynooth?

20:34.223 --> 20:35.645
No, what about him?

20:35.795 --> 20:37.129
He went wild.

20:37.482 --> 20:38.900
Maybe he works for Riddlemeyer.

20:40.426 --> 20:41.789
What do you mean wild?

20:41.939 --> 20:44.595
Well, they said crazy.
Tore up his restaurant.

20:45.323 --> 20:47.505
- Okay.
- Curious, huh?

20:47.797 --> 20:49.373
Yeah, listen, Bob.

20:49.523 --> 20:51.092
I saw Dr. Turnbull.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.475
She says she can do the operation.

20:57.897 --> 20:59.451
I know you heard me, Bob.

21:01.868 --> 21:03.604
I need to think about it, David.

21:04.237 --> 21:05.281
Sure.

21:09.046 --> 21:11.112
The report said
the man was hallucinating.

21:14.239 --> 21:15.366
Where is Maynooth?

21:15.516 --> 21:16.992
Right next to Algonquin Park.

21:19.922 --> 21:22.832
Get Rachel. Meet me
in the conference room in 15 minutes.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.491
Sure.

21:26.527 --> 21:29.463
Father Justin did not impregnate Molly.

21:32.965 --> 21:35.302
- Are you sure?
- Positive. We ran the test twice.

21:35.452 --> 21:37.426
First with 8 genetic markers
then with 12.

21:37.576 --> 21:38.579
Shit.

21:41.273 --> 21:42.742
There's something else.

21:42.892 --> 21:44.405
The baby's DNA...

21:45.462 --> 21:46.740
look strange.

21:48.101 --> 21:49.746
What do you mean by "strange"?

21:50.290 --> 21:52.475
There is very little genetic diversity

21:52.625 --> 21:55.177
- between Molly and her baby.
- Meaning what?

21:57.600 --> 22:00.713
Meaning that
the father could be a close relative.

22:03.165 --> 22:05.206
A brother, maybe a cousin.

22:07.963 --> 22:09.933
Molly doesn't have a brother.

22:11.610 --> 22:12.619
And...

22:14.525 --> 22:15.551
girl cousins.

22:20.781 --> 22:22.092
Her father, Wes?

22:22.791 --> 22:25.811
I mean, that would explain
why she's in such denial

22:25.961 --> 22:28.824
about being impregnated
because her father is the father.

22:30.773 --> 22:31.782
Fuck.

22:32.917 --> 22:33.926
I'm sorry.

22:37.033 --> 22:39.700
According to the police report,
the guy just went ape shit.

22:39.850 --> 22:42.253
You think there's some connection
to the bear attacks.

22:42.441 --> 22:44.893
The bear that attacked Craig,
describe his behaviour.

22:45.127 --> 22:46.790
Confused and aggressive.

22:46.940 --> 22:49.032
Sounds exactly like this guy
who went nuts up there.

22:49.182 --> 22:51.921
So are we looking at some ursine disease
that's jumped species?

22:52.244 --> 22:55.376
It could also be a chemical
or a metal that causes delirium.

22:55.661 --> 22:57.020
Something like arsenic,

22:57.170 --> 22:59.620
- mercury, lead.
- I think there's a connection.

22:59.770 --> 23:01.931
So I'll let Wes know
that NorBac's officially on this.

23:13.305 --> 23:14.888
Hey, whaddya up to?

23:15.639 --> 23:18.281
Blood analysis for arsenic
is notoriously inaccurate.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.891
So I'm doing a hair test
that's pretty reliable.

23:21.041 --> 23:25.096
Blood often migrates to
and remains in the folicles.

23:25.688 --> 23:28.640
- Well, if you need help or anything...
- Why would I need help?

23:28.898 --> 23:30.709
I don't know,
if you want to rest for a bit,

23:30.859 --> 23:31.709
maybe.

23:32.190 --> 23:33.966
Just so you know, I'm fine.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.454
I've already been blind.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.776
For 6 weeks after my surgery,

23:39.545 --> 23:41.157
I couldn't see a thing.

23:41.873 --> 23:44.014
You know,
I had to lie there perfectly still.

23:46.069 --> 23:47.934
I found it liberating.

23:48.379 --> 23:49.658
I listened to Bach

23:50.139 --> 23:51.781
and I felt calm.

23:53.124 --> 23:56.521
And then, miraculously,
light came back into my world.

23:59.885 --> 24:01.319
Anyway, David has it all set up.

24:01.469 --> 24:03.767
- Wait, what set up?
- That nanotrellis procedure.

24:03.976 --> 24:07.442
- You're gonna go through with that?
- Mayko, I want my eyesight back.

24:07.688 --> 24:11.208
Come on, Bob, think about the risks.
I mean, if you stay with your meds...

24:11.358 --> 24:12.836
I'll go blind slowly.

24:12.986 --> 24:14.877
But if I have the operation

24:15.027 --> 24:17.846
and if it fails,
I'll be completely blind in one eye

24:17.996 --> 24:20.301
and I don't know about the other.

24:21.614 --> 24:23.804
Anyway, David doesn't see
any other alternative.

24:24.077 --> 24:26.367
- David?
- Someone has to be first, Mayko.

24:26.517 --> 24:28.350
Fleming tested penicillin
on a friend of his.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.178
The link between helicobacter bacterium
and peptic ulcers:

24:31.328 --> 24:34.345
Barry Marshall tested it on himself
and won a Nobel Prize.

24:34.495 --> 24:36.275
Think of Pierre and Marie Curie's work

24:36.425 --> 24:39.482
- in isolating radium.
- Curies died of radiation poisoning.

24:39.632 --> 24:41.989
Actually,
a carriage ran over Pierre's head

24:42.139 --> 24:45.319
before the radiation could actually
take a hol...

24:46.046 --> 24:48.275
- I'll be back in a sec.
- Hold.

24:50.632 --> 24:52.593
- Yeah, what?
- Bob says he's going through

24:52.743 --> 24:54.444
- with this operation.
- It's right.

24:54.679 --> 24:57.199
- You really think that's the answer?
- There is no answer.

24:57.349 --> 24:59.064
All we can do is flap our little wings

24:59.214 --> 25:02.009
and try not to fly
too close to the sun, <i>et cetera</i>.

25:02.159 --> 25:03.885
- So, is it microbial?
- What?

25:04.039 --> 25:06.147
The thing driving the bears
is it microbial?

25:06.297 --> 25:08.547
- We don't know.
- Then what are you standing here for?

25:08.697 --> 25:11.975
Because I think Bob should make
the decision about this operation.

25:12.125 --> 25:14.600
- He did.
- No. You made it for him.

25:14.799 --> 25:18.250
Mayko, do you have any idea
what'll happen to Bob

25:18.400 --> 25:19.985
if he doesn't get his eyesight back?

25:20.328 --> 25:22.653
We were just talking about it
and he is fine with it.

25:22.803 --> 25:24.365
Really? I don't know what he told you

25:24.515 --> 25:26.427
but he completely lost it
the first time.

25:26.658 --> 25:28.395
Doctors thought
he was gonna hurt himself.

25:28.547 --> 25:30.829
They had to heavily medicate him
to try to shut him down.

25:32.227 --> 25:34.190
He came seconds away
from completely cracking up.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.460
You want to sit back and watch?
I sure as hell don't.

25:36.610 --> 25:38.671
And I agree. But it's his decision.

25:38.821 --> 25:40.255
- And he made it.
- No, David,

25:40.405 --> 25:41.507
you made it for him.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.717
David, Bob worships you, okay?

25:43.867 --> 25:46.345
You found out about this experiment
and put him up for it.

25:47.801 --> 25:50.989
- You should examine your motives.
- What is that supposed to mean?

25:52.349 --> 25:54.687
Look, is this... about your father?

25:55.310 --> 25:57.547
- Okay, back the fuck off.
- No! Listen to me.

25:57.734 --> 26:01.402
You wished you'd gone through with
the prion injections. And you didn't.

26:02.530 --> 26:03.912
And he died, I'm sorry.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.490
But now you're trying
to make amends with him by saving Bob?

26:10.559 --> 26:12.579
You can go back to work now, Mayko.

26:36.121 --> 26:37.417
Tasted different.

26:38.508 --> 26:39.606
The chicken.

26:40.036 --> 26:41.408
I can't explain it.

26:42.593 --> 26:45.340
You know something, David?
This could be a good thing.

26:45.490 --> 26:46.566
How's that?

26:46.716 --> 26:49.496
Well, I could experience the world
in a whole new way.

26:50.259 --> 26:54.540
My hearing's heightened. I taste things
differently. Maybe I'll touch...

26:59.733 --> 27:01.962
Rachel said there was another
aggressive behaviour,

27:02.206 --> 27:03.745
among people, I mean.

27:03.895 --> 27:05.491
Near Algonquin Park.

27:06.685 --> 27:09.634
We didn't get far with investigation,
which is to say, we got far,

27:09.784 --> 27:13.331
but we got nothing,
I mean, anything that's shown up as...

27:21.071 --> 27:22.157
I'm so scared.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.423
- I know, Bob.
- No, you don't.

27:25.286 --> 27:28.277
You don't know the terror
of not being able to see.

27:30.765 --> 27:34.124
I'm looking at the world,
trying to memorize it,

27:35.407 --> 27:38.484
because after the operation,
I may never even see it again.

27:38.634 --> 27:40.581
I hated it the last time.

27:44.459 --> 27:46.916
I wasn't very good at being blind,
was I?

27:47.807 --> 27:49.614
You kvetched a little bit.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.312
A lot.

27:54.696 --> 27:56.092
Bob, listen to me.

27:58.401 --> 28:00.526
If you don't wanna go through with this,
you just...

28:00.676 --> 28:02.606
You just say the word
and we'll cancel it.

28:03.251 --> 28:04.262
No, I mean it.

28:04.412 --> 28:06.517
Maybe if you think that I've...

28:06.840 --> 28:10.623
- pushed you into this, you just say so.
- No, no, David.

28:12.957 --> 28:15.536
No, you don't think I pushed you
or no, you don't wanna do it?

28:16.957 --> 28:19.462
- I don't want to do it, David.
- Okay.

28:20.788 --> 28:22.359
Okay, that's it then.

28:22.981 --> 28:24.166
I understand.

28:24.518 --> 28:25.712
No, you don't.

28:27.151 --> 28:29.004
I don't wanna do it, David.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.728
But I have to.

28:46.710 --> 28:48.091
How dare you, Wes!

28:49.455 --> 28:50.831
We have evidence, Eliot.

28:50.981 --> 28:53.316
- Bullshit science!
- That's right, you have religion.

28:53.466 --> 28:55.295
Fuck science! Fuck scientists!

28:55.445 --> 28:58.036
- Your own daughter, while you're at it!
- You son of a bitch!

29:00.159 --> 29:01.330
Pray, Eliot.

29:01.480 --> 29:02.797
Pray, you fuck!

29:03.313 --> 29:04.751
Wes, take it easy.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.096
I will kill you!

29:07.246 --> 29:09.464
I did the science.
If there's a problem, it's with me.

29:09.614 --> 29:11.412
You're the one saying
I raped my daughter?

29:11.562 --> 29:14.406
No, I said that Father Justin's DNA
did not match the baby's.

29:14.556 --> 29:16.328
There is a match
to someone in the family.

29:16.478 --> 29:19.063
- Well, then you are saying...
- I'm not saying anything.

29:19.213 --> 29:21.005
We have to check every male relative.

29:21.184 --> 29:23.437
That's a pretty candy-ass way
of accusing me.

29:24.584 --> 29:25.397
Fine.

29:26.450 --> 29:27.459
Him too.

29:28.339 --> 29:30.527
You are a male relative, aren't you?

29:32.555 --> 29:33.874
That's fine, Carlos.

29:37.701 --> 29:38.709
You okay?

29:49.295 --> 29:50.300
Hey.

29:50.450 --> 29:51.381
Hey.

29:51.531 --> 29:54.135
- The autopsy report on the chef.
- Great, let's take a look.

29:54.285 --> 29:55.904
Come here, have a seat.

29:57.845 --> 29:59.933
Alright, cause of death.

30:00.745 --> 30:03.491
Self-inflicted gunshot wound
to the head.

30:03.641 --> 30:05.294
I spoke to the investigating officer.

30:05.444 --> 30:07.425
The guy who killed himself
was a gourmand.

30:07.578 --> 30:10.768
He ran one of those specialty inns:
wild game,

30:10.931 --> 30:13.612
produce from his own garden,
locally crafted cheeses.

30:13.762 --> 30:17.157
He always closed the restaurant on
Mondays to gather woodland delicacies.

30:17.307 --> 30:20.931
This time, he came back from the forest
and started smashing the restaurant.

30:21.081 --> 30:23.622
His wife said
he was babbling like a madman.

30:23.944 --> 30:28.585
- What kind of stuff was he gathering?
- Watercress, wild leeks, chanterelles,

30:28.735 --> 30:30.437
- cranberries.
- Chanterelles, mushrooms.

30:30.587 --> 30:34.448
<i>Chantarellus cibarius,</i> grows
in acidic soil under oaks and conifers.

30:34.598 --> 30:37.396
What if he made a mistake
and ate the wrong kind of mushroom?

30:37.680 --> 30:39.439
You mean like a bad trip.

30:39.589 --> 30:41.640
Let's get samples
of everything he collected.

30:41.957 --> 30:43.229
Sure, I'm on it.

30:51.358 --> 30:52.567
So how is everybody?

30:55.781 --> 30:58.490
I sent your charts
to the Emery Clinic in Virginia.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.035
What's that?

31:01.351 --> 31:04.746
The top plastic surgery facility
in America. They have pioneered

31:04.896 --> 31:08.054
all sorts of reconstructive procedures.
Their work is fantastic; it's amazing.

31:08.204 --> 31:11.128
There are good plastic surgeons here.
Mom has the numbers.

31:11.816 --> 31:14.548
I've spoken to your doctor
and he says you're good to travel.

31:15.628 --> 31:16.633
Is that true?

31:17.315 --> 31:18.649
Of course, it's true.

31:20.529 --> 31:21.878
I'll think about it.

31:22.664 --> 31:26.158
Vic Emery says it's vital
that we begin surgical intervention

31:26.308 --> 31:27.889
before the scar tissue sets.

31:28.039 --> 31:30.177
Which is now. Not tomorrow. Today.

31:30.327 --> 31:33.041
I mean, the longer we wait,
the more complications begin...

31:33.291 --> 31:34.844
No. I'm gonna stay here.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.821
- I don't believe this.
- Carl.

31:41.573 --> 31:42.998
You talk to him, Rachel.

31:46.484 --> 31:48.749
Alright, just give us a minute, please.

32:01.262 --> 32:02.529
I don't know.

32:04.481 --> 32:05.642
I mean, I...

32:07.377 --> 32:11.061
I really think all he cares about now
is seeing you get healthy again.

32:13.495 --> 32:15.160
Jack up my face and...

32:16.104 --> 32:18.931
- cure me of being a fag?
- Oh, honey, don't.

32:19.752 --> 32:21.775
Don't, okay? Don't do that.

32:23.018 --> 32:24.191
It's just...

32:24.959 --> 32:26.859
It's time for clear thinking.

32:27.780 --> 32:31.718
Alright? This is your future
we are talking about, and he is right.

32:32.557 --> 32:34.503
Emery is the best there is.

32:36.117 --> 32:37.436
I just think...

32:39.853 --> 32:42.721
You can't let your feelings
about your father

32:43.706 --> 32:47.015
get in the way of making the choice
that's best for you right now.

32:49.207 --> 32:51.198
He wants to control my life.

32:51.823 --> 32:52.832
Craig.

32:55.817 --> 32:57.166
He never will.

32:59.007 --> 33:00.274
You are...

33:01.310 --> 33:03.726
so much stronger and braver...

33:05.756 --> 33:07.536
than he will ever be.

33:11.012 --> 33:12.819
And I think he knows that.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.035
Don't you dare let him win.

33:22.394 --> 33:23.403
Okay.

33:29.383 --> 33:30.391
Well?

33:39.952 --> 33:40.961
Okay.

33:42.279 --> 33:43.781
Okay, he'll go.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.428
Thank God one of us got through to him.

33:46.578 --> 33:49.597
I want to make one thing
perfectly fucking clear.

33:50.087 --> 33:54.087
This is not about you or me. This is
about him and what is best for him.

33:54.693 --> 33:57.649
And I hope to God
that's the reason you're doing this.

34:00.462 --> 34:01.505
Thank you.

34:18.630 --> 34:22.027
So we've isolated the fetal DNA,
run 2 different kinds

34:22.177 --> 34:24.010
of tests, and micro satellites.

34:24.159 --> 34:26.947
- Those are long strings of repeat DNA.
- Right.

34:27.098 --> 34:28.562
And SNPs analysis.

34:28.902 --> 34:33.179
- So where is this heading?
- We looked carefully at the fetal DNA.

34:33.887 --> 34:36.708
There's too much similarity
for just a grandparent.

34:39.096 --> 34:40.462
My brother raped his daughter.

34:41.911 --> 34:45.717
It's not that simple. There are some
numbers that just don't add up.

34:46.041 --> 34:47.092
What's going on?

34:47.864 --> 34:50.717
I'd like to know what's going on.
Because for the last couple of days,

34:50.868 --> 34:53.873
I've noticed your little...
group having these ad hoc meetings.

34:54.024 --> 34:58.022
I know it's not my birthday coming up,
so you're not planning a surprise party.

34:59.630 --> 35:02.023
David, would you please shut the door.

35:09.238 --> 35:11.354
It makes absolutely no sense.

35:13.315 --> 35:16.215
Did Eliot get Molly pregnant?
I need to know.

35:16.365 --> 35:17.985
I wanna call the police.

35:24.713 --> 35:26.653
What's the name of Eliot's ex-wife?

35:26.944 --> 35:27.953
Andrea.

35:30.433 --> 35:31.477
Andrea.

35:32.509 --> 35:33.518
Eliot.

35:34.297 --> 35:35.306
Molly.

35:36.191 --> 35:37.200
Baby.

35:37.823 --> 35:40.755
Molly got 50% of her DNA from Eliot.

35:42.424 --> 35:44.298
50% of her DNA

35:44.791 --> 35:45.984
from Andrea.

35:46.993 --> 35:50.782
Baby got 50% of her DNA from Molly.

35:51.330 --> 35:53.915
Which breaks down
to 25% from her grandmother

35:54.065 --> 35:56.240
and 25% from her grandfather.

35:56.438 --> 35:59.694
And she got 50% of her DNA from...

35:59.880 --> 36:01.119
whoever the father was.

36:01.269 --> 36:03.044
Now, if Eliot is the baby's father

36:03.194 --> 36:07.232
that means that 50% of the baby's DNA
comes from Eliot as its father

36:07.783 --> 36:12.012
25% of its DNA comes from Eliot
as its grandfather.

36:12.162 --> 36:14.723
For a total of 75%.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.474
No, but that's the thing.

36:16.624 --> 36:20.478
We've checked and re-checked,
and it's 50% Eliot's DNA in that baby.

36:21.157 --> 36:22.355
Okay, so it's...

36:23.240 --> 36:24.249
50...

36:35.959 --> 36:37.750
Andrea fucked the milkman.

36:39.094 --> 36:41.408
- What?
- Only way this is possible

36:42.132 --> 36:45.378
is if Eliot is only
the biological father of the baby,

36:45.528 --> 36:48.019
not the biological father of Molly.

36:49.343 --> 36:52.010
- Call the police, Wes.
- No, but wait a minute, David.

36:52.160 --> 36:56.166
We have DNA profiles of Eliot and Molly.
And with a 100% certainty,

36:56.506 --> 36:58.391
Eliot is Molly's biological father.

36:58.541 --> 36:59.647
Well then...

37:01.512 --> 37:02.520
See that's...

37:02.739 --> 37:04.814
We keep going in circles with this.

37:09.962 --> 37:10.820
Oh shit.

37:11.253 --> 37:12.155
What?

37:14.711 --> 37:16.493
I need to look at those SNPs analysis.

37:23.295 --> 37:25.310
You are absolutely certain
you didn't mix this up?

37:25.460 --> 37:29.627
- David, we ran every test twice.
- Over 500 000 strands, SNPs analysis.

37:29.777 --> 37:32.717
- Mayko and I did them independently.
- What are you doing, David?

37:33.118 --> 37:35.292
We're gonna look at some DNA, Wes.

37:35.442 --> 37:37.323
'Cause I got a really creepy hunch.

37:38.078 --> 37:40.183
No, not this. I... This is Molly...

37:40.333 --> 37:44.074
and Eliot's DNA.
I want Molly and the baby's.

37:45.998 --> 37:46.962
There.

37:48.638 --> 37:49.693
What just happened?

37:50.597 --> 37:51.606
What?

37:54.614 --> 37:55.782
They lined up.

37:56.755 --> 37:58.561
The baby is...

38:00.456 --> 38:01.579
a clone.

38:01.863 --> 38:02.956
Come on, David.

38:03.302 --> 38:04.582
Or an identical twin.

38:04.732 --> 38:07.235
You can call it whatever you want.
But my point is that

38:07.385 --> 38:10.130
Molly and the baby are genetic...

38:11.667 --> 38:12.736
Genetic copies.

38:12.886 --> 38:16.219
Eliot is not the father because
the baby doesn't have a father.

38:16.418 --> 38:19.264
- Oh shit.
- How the hell could that even happen?

38:20.099 --> 38:22.851
Molly was either abducted by aliens
or she's from the future.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.355
Could you please be serious?

38:24.531 --> 38:28.523
I was being half-serious Wes,
because the only other explanation is...

38:29.009 --> 38:31.099
I don't think
anybody here's willing to say it.

38:31.249 --> 38:33.486
Come on, David, there is no way!

38:33.872 --> 38:35.640
- Impossible.
- What's impossible?

38:35.790 --> 38:37.525
- How long have you known me?
- Too long.

38:37.675 --> 38:40.827
Then you should know that the word
<i>impossible</i> doesn't belong in this lab.

38:40.977 --> 38:44.045
- What are you talking about?!
- I'll say it, if you don't want to.

38:47.903 --> 38:49.294
Parthenogenesis.

38:50.131 --> 38:51.252
What is that?

38:52.114 --> 38:54.090
Parthenos: virgin.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.410
Genesis: birth.

39:00.869 --> 39:02.687
A virgin birth?

39:03.485 --> 39:04.976
Have you lost your fucking mind?

39:05.126 --> 39:06.895
It is a biological term.

39:07.294 --> 39:11.192
David, parthogenesis has only been seen
in aphids, lizards, and fish.

39:11.342 --> 39:14.570
Well, actually, the Japanese did manage
to recreate it in mice.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.404
Okay, but not in humans.

39:16.903 --> 39:17.906
Wrong!

39:18.724 --> 39:19.885
Search.

39:21.036 --> 39:23.949
I read some articles in <i>Lancet</i>
when I was an undergrad.

39:24.099 --> 39:27.558
But that was before molecular
genetics tests. They were never proven.

39:28.250 --> 39:29.980
Well, that's what we're gonna do.

39:30.485 --> 39:32.879
Now, in order
for parthenogenesis to occur,

39:33.029 --> 39:35.173
Wes, two things need to happen.
First of all

39:35.323 --> 39:39.178
Molly's egg needed
to gain an extra copy of DNA.

39:39.328 --> 39:42.506
- Somehow.
- Fertilized without the fertilizer.

39:42.694 --> 39:45.832
And then the hard part,
the part that makes this impossible.

39:46.591 --> 39:49.916
That egg DNA somehow had to...
come alive.

39:50.066 --> 39:53.960
Normally, it's the sperm that does that.
So we need to look for something that...

39:54.605 --> 39:56.517
That could trigger all of this.

39:56.703 --> 39:58.643
My guess is it's a bacterium.

39:58.793 --> 40:01.632
You know,
I read about <i>Wolbachia pipientis.</i>

40:01.782 --> 40:03.610
It does exactly this in wasps.

40:03.760 --> 40:07.121
I think David's on to something.
Most likely candidate is a bacterium.

40:07.359 --> 40:10.713
A bacterium that somehow
infected her developing eggs.

40:15.713 --> 40:18.082
We need to look
at some of Molly's cells.

40:18.557 --> 40:19.823
Yeah, I'll...

40:20.152 --> 40:23.154
I'll go look at her CVS samples,
see if there are cells there.

40:24.186 --> 40:25.254
Yeah.

40:34.605 --> 40:37.139
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, I just got a call.

40:39.143 --> 40:41.006
My phone rings all the time, Bob.

40:41.156 --> 40:43.910
Dr. Turnbull arranged
to do the operation here at St. Mike's.

40:44.060 --> 40:45.832
Really, how'd she swing that?

40:46.612 --> 40:48.656
You know what, never mind.
That's great news.

40:50.427 --> 40:52.629
It's a day of miracles, Bob.

40:53.352 --> 40:55.710
- Goddamn day of miracles.
- Yeah.

41:17.112 --> 41:18.383
- Mayko.
<i>- Carlos.</i>

41:18.533 --> 41:21.875
So I found a bacterium in the cells in
the mother's uterus and the CVS sample.

41:22.025 --> 41:24.115
I need to know
what they are and if there's a match.

41:24.410 --> 41:25.521
<i>And if they are?</i>

41:25.745 --> 41:28.103
We need to see
if it can do what David said.

41:28.417 --> 41:29.590
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

41:31.387 --> 41:32.540
A virgin birth?

41:33.259 --> 41:34.694
It's a miracle!

41:34.844 --> 41:36.125
Not really.

41:36.821 --> 41:37.879
What is it?

41:39.362 --> 41:40.381
We're not sure.

41:41.529 --> 41:42.867
Well, I am.

41:44.636 --> 41:45.691
Oh then,

41:46.138 --> 41:47.430
I am gonna have a son.

41:47.695 --> 41:50.391
He's not gonna be a he.
He's gonna be a she.

41:50.541 --> 41:53.061
It's a little girl.
She's gonna be just like you.

41:53.625 --> 41:54.896
Okay? Like a twin.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.607
- It's a miracle.
- Eliot, would you let David finish?

41:58.936 --> 42:01.402
And chances are, she won't be normal.

42:02.345 --> 42:03.600
Of course not.

42:04.292 --> 42:05.698
She'll be the daughter of God.

42:06.514 --> 42:07.992
God made my baby.

42:08.733 --> 42:11.162
I think maybe a bacterium did.

42:12.581 --> 42:14.207
- That's ridiculous.
- Eliot.

42:14.357 --> 42:15.249
See...

42:15.936 --> 42:19.170
bacteria can do
this kind of thing in other species.

42:19.553 --> 42:20.773
Other animals.

42:21.308 --> 42:22.306
Maybe

42:22.628 --> 42:25.039
that's God's way of working miracles.

42:27.334 --> 42:28.322
Through nature.

42:28.472 --> 42:29.347
Yeah.

42:31.437 --> 42:34.252
I mean, yes,
you can look at it that way.

42:34.785 --> 42:35.853
But...

42:36.829 --> 42:41.298
Well then, getting a bacterial pneumonia
and dying from it would also be

42:41.676 --> 42:43.258
considered a miracle, right?

42:45.527 --> 42:48.866
- Molly, you shouldn't have this baby.
- Don't tell her that!

42:49.016 --> 42:51.369
In cases like this, very often

42:51.519 --> 42:53.830
the baby has severe abnormalities,

42:53.980 --> 42:55.351
both mental and physical.

42:55.501 --> 42:58.501
- God smiles on all of his children.
- Well, he might. But...

42:58.651 --> 43:01.212
you might not if its lips are
in the middle of its forehead.

43:09.281 --> 43:11.674
Bottom line, Molly,
is you're just a kid.

43:11.914 --> 43:12.934
I mean,

43:13.659 --> 43:15.643
are you ready to have a kid of your own?

43:16.041 --> 43:17.827
A kid that might be very sick?

43:17.977 --> 43:20.305
A kid who may be the daughter of God?

43:24.366 --> 43:26.020
Can we go? Can we go now?

43:27.146 --> 43:28.156
Yeah.

43:41.549 --> 43:42.910
What are you gonna do?

43:44.610 --> 43:46.007
What if she's right?

44:08.697 --> 44:12.241
Okay. We have to be at the hospital
by 10:00 tomorrow morning.

44:12.765 --> 44:14.152
- Okay.
- After the surgery,

44:14.302 --> 44:17.046
I'll bring you back here.
You can stay as long as you like.

44:17.205 --> 44:18.273
Thank you.

44:18.578 --> 44:19.541
Dig in.

44:19.691 --> 44:21.443
- Smells good.
- I burned the potatoes.

44:21.593 --> 44:23.476
- I like burnt potatoes.
- I know.

44:24.813 --> 44:26.352
But I can't eat...

44:26.502 --> 44:27.534
tonight.

44:27.781 --> 44:29.611
- Why?
- Surgery tomorrow.

44:29.898 --> 44:32.057
Oh no, you've got till midnight.

44:32.247 --> 44:33.054
Sure.

44:33.669 --> 44:34.931
I'm just not hungry.

44:39.228 --> 44:40.319
Me neither.

44:45.152 --> 44:46.689
Do you wanna watch some TV?

44:47.650 --> 44:50.057
- Sure. Whaddya wanna watch?
- Anything.

44:50.207 --> 44:51.495
I don't feel like reading.

44:57.157 --> 44:59.455
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?

45:00.189 --> 45:02.875
They're announcing
Molly's pregnancy on the news.

45:03.025 --> 45:04.615
Molly is Wes' niece.

45:04.765 --> 45:08.256
Headline says "Jesus: The Sequel?"
At least they used a question mark.

45:08.572 --> 45:10.029
Don't say my name.

45:10.890 --> 45:13.688
Just don't say my name. Please don't...

45:13.838 --> 45:15.821
Oh, for fuck sakes!

45:25.751 --> 45:26.759
What?

45:28.062 --> 45:29.247
No comment.

45:31.264 --> 45:32.273
What?

45:33.616 --> 45:34.847
No comment.

45:38.905 --> 45:39.958
Go away!

45:46.994 --> 45:48.462
Eliot, you didn't call me back?

45:48.612 --> 45:50.673
What were you thinking
with that press conference?

45:50.823 --> 45:53.384
<i>- Your daugther look like a freak show.</i>
- Don't Wes.

45:53.534 --> 45:54.802
I watch the news.

45:54.952 --> 45:57.096
Molly is the new Virgin Mary, come on!

45:57.246 --> 45:58.514
We got the SOS yesterday.

45:58.664 --> 46:01.392
24 on the crew manifest, 22 are missing.

46:01.542 --> 46:03.561
We need NorBac to answer 3 questions.

46:03.711 --> 46:05.021
Is this outbreak contagious?

46:05.171 --> 46:07.523
What's the cause?
And is it safe to evacuate?

46:07.673 --> 46:09.066
What happened to your crew?

46:11.512 --> 46:12.874
I don't know.

46:13.179 --> 46:14.780
We'll need a complete set of organs.

46:14.930 --> 46:17.617
Include brain and blood,
scrapings from under the fingernails.

46:17.772 --> 46:20.597
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking I haven't a clue.

46:21.559 --> 46:23.414
Let's build some bridges.

46:24.035 --> 46:27.273
And when these bandages come off,
I am going to see.

46:27.423 --> 46:28.419
What do you see?

46:31.339 --> 46:32.359
Wes!

46:34.670 --> 46:37.616
Yes, we have an emergency.
I need an ambulance at NorBac.
