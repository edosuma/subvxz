04:51.574 --> 04:52.699
Stop!

05:11.386 --> 05:13.011
Hey, y'all

05:32.241 --> 05:34.075
Little bugger!

05:36.078 --> 05:38.246
Not live rounds, Lara.

05:38.747 --> 05:41.582
He's in real pain right now.

05:41.875 --> 05:46.129
This is a major remodel.
This is a disaster.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.966
Was it programmed to stop before it
took my head off?

05:50.050 --> 05:53.761
Ah, well, that would be a no.

05:55.264 --> 05:57.640
But you said make it more challenging,
so...

05:57.725 --> 05:59.559
Hence, the live fire.

06:04.815 --> 06:07.108
Live rounds again.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.152
Poor Simon.

06:09.445 --> 06:11.446
What has she done to you?

07:08.338 --> 07:10.339
Oh. Very funny.

07:10.423 --> 07:12.800
I'm only trying to turn you into a lady.

07:15.512 --> 07:17.388
And a lady should be modest.

07:17.472 --> 07:20.265
Yes, a lady should be modest.

07:35.866 --> 07:38.368
Brothers and sisters,

07:38.452 --> 07:41.871
today is the 15th of May,

07:41.956 --> 07:46.209
the first day of the planetary alignment,

07:46.293 --> 07:50.713
and we are still no nearer to discovering
the location of the key.

07:50.798 --> 07:52.382
It seems

07:52.466 --> 07:55.343
we are running out of time.

07:55.428 --> 07:57.804
This is not acceptable.

07:59.432 --> 08:03.643
Mr Powell,
your explanation for this, please?

08:04.770 --> 08:08.731
I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.

08:08.816 --> 08:12.444
Except to once again
respectfully remind the council

08:12.528 --> 08:14.237
that we are working from clues

08:14.321 --> 08:17.115
based on
ancient cosmological models

08:18.284 --> 08:21.077
predating Aristotle.

08:21.162 --> 08:24.747
But I'm happy to announce
that we're almost ready.

08:24.832 --> 08:28.084
And I am supremely confident

08:28.169 --> 08:32.589
that we will have our answer in time
for the relevant planetary alignment.

08:32.673 --> 08:36.467
So, we will have possession
of the key in

08:37.470 --> 08:39.179
one week.

08:39.931 --> 08:43.308
Yes, indeed. One week.

08:43.393 --> 08:47.771
This is good news, Mr Powell,
but remember,

08:47.856 --> 08:50.608
we have only a single opportunity

08:50.692 --> 08:54.028
to retrieve the two halves of the triangle.

08:54.112 --> 08:56.780
And if we fail,

08:56.865 --> 09:00.784
we must wait another 5,000 years.

09:02.996 --> 09:04.788
I don't know about you,
but that's more time

09:04.873 --> 09:08.000
than I am prepared to commit
to this enterprise.

09:09.419 --> 09:11.086
We shall be ready.

09:13.298 --> 09:14.590
Trust me.

09:26.436 --> 09:29.355
- We're not... We're not ready, are we?
- No.

09:35.487 --> 09:38.989
Good morning, Lara.
And what a beautiful morning it is.

09:40.575 --> 09:42.618
Back to work, I'm afraid.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.914
It's adventure time.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.126
Egypt again.

09:51.629 --> 09:53.880
It's nothing but pyramids and sand.

09:53.965 --> 09:56.925
I know. Gets everywhere. In the cracks.

10:00.721 --> 10:02.347
Spanish galleon?

10:04.934 --> 10:07.477
Do you know what day it is, Hillary?

10:08.896 --> 10:11.481
Yes, of course.

10:13.359 --> 10:14.651
The 15th.

10:16.237 --> 10:18.488
And that is never a good day.

10:42.513 --> 10:44.180
I miss you, Daddy.

10:46.434 --> 10:50.104
I wish we could get back the time
that was stolen from us.

11:13.879 --> 11:16.589
My father would loved to have seen this.

11:18.258 --> 11:22.053
Tonight Pluto and Neptune
align with Uranus.

11:22.137 --> 11:24.597
It's the first stage of the alignment
of all nine planets

11:24.681 --> 11:27.850
culminating in a full solar eclipse.

11:27.934 --> 11:31.020
It only happens once every 5,000 years.

11:31.104 --> 11:32.897
When is the eclipse?

11:33.148 --> 11:34.940
One week from today.

11:36.109 --> 11:39.945
But there is plenty to look out for
until then.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.074
Incredible.

12:15.566 --> 12:19.236
I wish you could remember her.
She loved you so much.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.987
Mummy!

12:22.657 --> 12:25.742
I wish I could remember her, too.

12:25.827 --> 12:28.912
- I still have you, Daddy.
- Yes, you do.

12:34.127 --> 12:38.755
The exact alignment of the planets
necessary to activate the triangle

12:38.840 --> 12:43.260
only occurs once every 5,000 years.

12:44.053 --> 12:47.681
But that will prove to be
just long enough

12:47.765 --> 12:51.059
for little Lara Croft to grow up

12:51.144 --> 12:53.770
and to find it.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.770
Bryce!

14:58.857 --> 15:00.524
Hello, fellas.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.110
- How's business?
- Bryce!

15:04.612 --> 15:07.531
Okay, okay. I'm coming. I'm coming.

15:11.287 --> 15:14.289
We have 83 rooms.
Why can't you live in the house?

15:14.373 --> 15:16.875
Well, I'm a free spirit, me.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.126
Right.

15:20.379 --> 15:21.629
What's that smell?

15:21.755 --> 15:24.424
5:00 a. M. Let's go.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.804
This had better be good.

15:34.143 --> 15:35.643
It's a clock.

15:36.145 --> 15:39.647
I found it last night. It was ticking.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.820
Must be one of them ticking clocks, eh?

15:46.780 --> 15:49.115
It was hidden in a secret room.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.075
Bryce.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.579
Don't start.

15:54.663 --> 15:59.626
Well, Lara, it's a clock. It ticks.
It tells the time. It's wrong.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.753
It started ticking

16:01.837 --> 16:05.089
last night during the first stage
of the alignment.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.305
Well, gonna need some coffee.

16:17.187 --> 16:19.480
Okay, in we go.

16:22.442 --> 16:24.360
Looks pretty ordinary to me.

16:24.486 --> 16:26.195
Well, keep looking.

16:30.325 --> 16:34.203
Your coffee, sir.
Decaf latte with non-fat milk.

16:35.622 --> 16:39.375
Oh, champion. Steaming sump oil.

16:44.214 --> 16:47.132
Wait. What did you do?

16:47.217 --> 16:50.636
- I don't know. What did I do?
- Where is that?

16:50.720 --> 16:53.639
I don't know.
I just took my hand off the fibre optics.

16:53.723 --> 16:55.391
What is that?

16:55.517 --> 16:58.727
- Oh, bugger!
- Bugger.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.068
Screw 13 to quadrant four.

17:07.028 --> 17:11.406
- Screw 14 to quadrant three.
- Oh, please.

17:12.659 --> 17:15.743
It's my map,
so I know where they all came from.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.705
It's camouflage.

17:30.094 --> 17:32.095
Okay.

17:42.398 --> 17:43.940
Hidden within.

17:47.194 --> 17:48.695
What is that?

17:53.701 --> 17:55.452
The All Seeing Eye.

18:08.090 --> 18:12.761
Lot 121, a Louis XV Ormolu
mounted bracket clock.

18:12.970 --> 18:17.057
Showing on my left, #1,800,000.

18:17.141 --> 18:20.894
#1,800,000. Thank you.
#1,800,000. #1,900,000.

18:20.978 --> 18:22.896
#2,000,000. #2,000,000, now.

18:22.980 --> 18:25.983
#2,100,000. #2,100,000, now.

18:26.109 --> 18:30.488
#2,100,000.
Any advance on #2,100,000?

18:30.614 --> 18:33.908
Any more?
#2,100,000. #2,200,000. Thank you, sir.

18:33.992 --> 18:36.744
#2,200,000 now.

18:36.828 --> 18:39.914
At #2,200,000. #2,300,000.

18:39.998 --> 18:42.083
#2,300,000. #2,400,000.

18:42.167 --> 18:46.670
Lady's bid, #2,400,000 now. #2,400,000.

18:46.797 --> 18:48.756
Against you, sir. Two million five? No.

18:48.840 --> 18:52.259
#2,400,000, then.
Lady's bid at #2,400,000.

18:52.344 --> 18:54.053
#2,500,000.

18:54.179 --> 18:57.640
In a new place at #2,500,000.

18:57.724 --> 19:01.477
Any more at #2,500,000?

19:02.354 --> 19:03.687
Sold.

19:05.315 --> 19:07.358
Lara, my dear.

19:07.984 --> 19:09.610
- Mr Wilson.
- Let's go into my study.

19:09.694 --> 19:11.821
Let me take that for you.

19:11.905 --> 19:14.657
Lara Croft. I don't believe it.

19:16.660 --> 19:19.495
- I'll just be a minute.
- Hi.

19:23.917 --> 19:26.877
You still pretending to be
a photojournalist?

19:27.379 --> 19:31.091
You know, I think it's really cool
that you still have a day job,

19:32.218 --> 19:35.053
even though it's obviously just for show.

19:35.346 --> 19:39.266
So, Alex, are you still pretending
to be an archaeologist?

19:42.353 --> 19:43.436
Lara,

19:44.605 --> 19:45.981
do we always have to fight like this?

19:46.065 --> 19:48.400
I mean, maybe we don't.

19:49.402 --> 19:51.361
- Maybe we do.
- Why?

19:51.445 --> 19:54.281
- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? Stole?

19:54.407 --> 19:56.324
From you? You know, that's funny.
You know, it's...

19:56.409 --> 19:59.786
It's not like you ever really owned them
or anything.

20:01.414 --> 20:03.456
Hey, you're the tomb raider.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.333
Mr West, we are ready for you.

20:05.418 --> 20:08.420
Oh, I think your clients need you.

20:09.755 --> 20:12.716
Go ahead. You're wanted on the floor.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.970
After all, as you once said
so memorably, "It's all just a business."

20:17.096 --> 20:19.514
Right? So go do business.

20:19.599 --> 20:20.640
Go.

20:44.625 --> 20:49.462
Lara, this is a unique object.

20:50.297 --> 20:52.757
Only one of the dials is working.

20:52.841 --> 20:55.176
It glows, like the eye, lesser.

20:56.345 --> 20:58.721
But it seems to be getting brighter.

20:58.805 --> 21:01.224
And it's also running backwards,

21:01.308 --> 21:04.644
like it's not so much keeping time,
but counting down to something.

21:04.770 --> 21:05.978
- Yes.
- And look at the back.

21:06.104 --> 21:10.608
It's as though it fits into something,
almost like a key.

21:13.445 --> 21:17.865
Yes. Yes, fascinating.
Incredibly beautiful.

21:19.618 --> 21:20.785
My father once told me

21:20.869 --> 21:23.537
of a magical triangle
stamped with the All Seeing Eye.

21:23.664 --> 21:26.707
He said it gave its possessor
extraordinary power,

21:26.833 --> 21:29.126
the power to control time.

21:29.211 --> 21:32.964
He called it the Triangle of Light.
Have you heard of it?

21:33.048 --> 21:35.132
No. No, I haven't.

21:40.181 --> 21:44.685
He always steered his own course,
your father.

21:45.353 --> 21:47.688
He was a great man.

21:50.358 --> 21:52.859
Would you like some port?

21:53.361 --> 21:56.154
- It's really very fine.
- No.

21:56.239 --> 21:58.740
I can't help you, Lara.

21:58.866 --> 22:03.161
This clock truly is mystery.

22:23.558 --> 22:25.434
- Hello.
- Lara?

22:25.560 --> 22:27.436
Hello, it's Mr Wilson.

22:27.562 --> 22:31.440
Yes. Well, I...
You see, I had a second thought

22:31.566 --> 22:33.734
about that clock.

22:34.444 --> 22:36.737
There is a man
who may be able to help you.

22:36.821 --> 22:40.490
I gave him your number.
His name is Manfred Powell.

22:40.575 --> 22:42.451
You should see him.

22:42.577 --> 22:44.870
Thank you. I will.

22:44.954 --> 22:47.582
- Goodbye, Lara.
- You take care.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.417
Thank you.

22:51.628 --> 22:52.920
Bugger.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.358
Forgive me.

23:27.289 --> 23:28.706
Lady Croft.

23:28.791 --> 23:31.542
- Ah, Mr Powell.
- Oh, no, no, no. Good heavens, no.

23:31.627 --> 23:35.463
I'm actually his associate, Mr Pimms.

23:35.798 --> 23:39.342
- Mr Pimms?
- Yeah, like the beverage.

23:49.353 --> 23:51.021
Yeah, she's here.

23:54.651 --> 23:56.652
What does Mr Powell do?

23:57.487 --> 24:00.197
He's a lawyer. I'm his law clerk.

24:00.323 --> 24:04.493
It's a fairly recent appointment,
but enjoying it, all the varied work.

24:05.495 --> 24:08.497
- A lawyer.
- Isn't it obvious?

24:10.166 --> 24:12.167
Lady Croft, my pleasure.

24:12.502 --> 24:15.504
- Manfred Powell, Q.C.
- Good morning.

24:15.588 --> 24:19.508
I believe you are quite an authority
on things ancient and mythological.

24:20.009 --> 24:21.009
Well, I travel.

24:21.094 --> 24:24.012
No, no, Mr Wilson said
you were quite the archaeologist.

24:24.097 --> 24:25.347
Please.

24:26.349 --> 24:29.184
Oh, he's very sweet.

24:29.269 --> 24:31.603
He knew your father, I believe.

24:33.857 --> 24:36.024
Yes, they were great friends.

24:36.359 --> 24:39.778
I had the honour of meeting him
myself once, in Venice.

24:40.738 --> 24:43.532
I was so sorry to hear about his death.

24:48.746 --> 24:51.039
This is the clock I spoke of.

24:55.044 --> 24:56.713
Very interesting.

24:59.758 --> 25:02.594
It's a shame
you only brought photographs.

25:04.096 --> 25:07.724
Nevertheless, it is fascinating.

25:07.892 --> 25:10.810
You said it started ticking the night
of the alignment.

25:10.895 --> 25:11.978
Yes.

25:16.567 --> 25:19.235
- You said you were a lawyer?
- Yes.

25:19.904 --> 25:22.405
And the study of clocks is a hobby?

25:23.491 --> 25:25.325
This is an obsession.

25:26.452 --> 25:30.246
Really my speciality.
My practise centres around antiquities.

25:30.623 --> 25:32.749
But the origin of this clock

25:32.833 --> 25:34.626
completely eludes me.

25:37.963 --> 25:40.006
I think I've never seen anything quite
so beautiful

25:40.090 --> 25:42.258
that I know so little about.

25:47.556 --> 25:49.807
This is a pleasurable torment.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.478
My ignorance amuses me.

25:55.981 --> 25:58.107
"My ignorance amuses me."

26:00.237 --> 26:02.071
"My ignorance amuses me"?

26:02.447 --> 26:05.699
Yes, well, I've always found
your ignorance quite amusing.

26:05.784 --> 26:08.160
- Powell, however, is not ignorant.
- No?

26:08.620 --> 26:09.662
No.

26:10.455 --> 26:11.914
He's a liar.

26:26.012 --> 26:28.889
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Hillary.

26:28.974 --> 26:31.976
- Don't you stay up too late.
- I won't.

27:12.518 --> 27:14.978
Forward team, wait for my command.

27:20.067 --> 27:23.403
In position awaiting your order.

28:47.114 --> 28:48.406
Bastards!

28:49.700 --> 28:51.283
Bloody hell!

28:56.957 --> 28:58.666
On the left. On the left.

29:20.690 --> 29:22.816
Come on, Simon!

29:29.490 --> 29:30.699
Bugger!

31:18.642 --> 31:22.311
Lara, Lara, are you there? Pick up!

31:22.729 --> 31:25.273
Lara, can you hear me? Are you okay?

31:26.776 --> 31:30.153
I'm in the equipment room.
They're stealing my bloody clock.

31:30.238 --> 31:31.697
I know. I saw them.

31:35.410 --> 31:39.246
- You have to be my eyes.
- Are you armed?

31:40.623 --> 31:42.624
After a fashion, yes.

31:42.709 --> 31:45.210
All right. Three bad guys.

31:45.295 --> 31:47.337
Number one standing by
the Aston Martin.

31:47.422 --> 31:48.630
Right.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.301
Bingo!

32:08.985 --> 32:11.278
- Next.
- Okay, number two,

32:11.362 --> 32:13.280
crouched by the McLaren.

32:16.367 --> 32:17.743
Oh, bugger!

32:27.587 --> 32:30.506
- Are you okay?
- I just found my car keys.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.357
You're done, mate. Nice one.

34:05.395 --> 34:07.438
I think they've all gone.

34:08.648 --> 34:11.108
Well, they got what they came for.

34:12.777 --> 34:14.445
Sorry about that.

34:15.321 --> 34:16.739
That's fine.

34:58.365 --> 34:59.574
Hello?

35:04.330 --> 35:07.165
What the hell happened here?

35:16.425 --> 35:18.802
- Morning.
- Lady Lara Croft?

35:18.886 --> 35:21.429
Yes. You have something for me?

35:31.357 --> 35:34.692
I woke up this morning,
and I just hated everything.

35:35.194 --> 35:37.403
Right. Thanks.

35:42.451 --> 35:45.286
Who's Stribling,
Clive and Winterset then?

35:45.914 --> 35:49.792
- Sounds like a bunch of lawyers.
- They are a bunch of lawyers.

35:50.710 --> 35:53.963
- Well, I'll shut my face again.
- You are nosy.

35:54.047 --> 35:56.257
I'm not nosy. I just saw the name.

35:56.383 --> 35:59.885
It was a funny name.
I just asked her what the name was.

36:03.223 --> 36:05.057
It's from my father.

36:07.894 --> 36:10.354
It was written before he died

36:10.438 --> 36:13.399
and delivered today
as per his instructions.

36:13.900 --> 36:16.235
- Blimey!
- Holy...

36:26.079 --> 36:28.622
"To see a world in a grain of sand

36:28.748 --> 36:31.167
"and a heaven in a wild flower,

36:31.835 --> 36:35.004
"hold infinity in the palm of your hand

36:35.088 --> 36:37.256
"and eternity in an hour."

36:38.925 --> 36:40.426
William Blake.

37:07.038 --> 37:08.788
The All Seeing Eye.

37:31.729 --> 37:33.605
"My darling daughter,

37:33.689 --> 37:36.733
"I knew you'd figure this out.

37:36.817 --> 37:39.527
"If you are reading this letter,
I am no longer with you"

37:39.654 --> 37:43.949
and I miss you,
and love you always and forever.

37:44.700 --> 37:47.619
It also means I have failed

37:47.954 --> 37:51.164
and must place an awful burden
on your shoulders.

37:51.499 --> 37:56.295
"Lara, by now I am sure you will have
discovered the clock I concealed."

37:56.964 --> 38:00.591
The clock is the key, Lara.

38:00.676 --> 38:05.596
"It will unlock the hiding place of two
pieces of a sacred icon."

38:05.681 --> 38:09.517
This is the magical triangle I told you
about when you were a little girl.

38:09.643 --> 38:14.105
The Triangle of Light.
But it is no bedtime story.

38:14.189 --> 38:18.150
"The triangle was forged from metal
found in the crater of a meteor

38:18.235 --> 38:20.278
"that had fallen to Earth
at the exact moment

38:20.362 --> 38:23.447
"of the previous alignment
of the nine planets.

38:23.532 --> 38:26.117
"The people of the light built a great city
in this crater

38:26.201 --> 38:30.121
"where they worshipped the triangle
for its ability to control time.

38:30.205 --> 38:34.750
"It gave its possessor a power that
could be used for good or great evil.

38:34.876 --> 38:38.546
"An abuse of this power
led to the destruction of the city.

38:41.008 --> 38:44.760
"To be sure no man would ever again
wield this power,

38:44.886 --> 38:47.013
"they split the triangle into two pieces

38:47.097 --> 38:50.558
"and hid them
at opposite ends of the Earth.

38:50.684 --> 38:54.770
"Lara, do you remember the jasmine
that only grows in one temple

38:54.896 --> 38:57.648
"along the ancient Khmer trail
in Cambodia?

38:57.733 --> 38:59.817
"Find that,
and you will have found the entrance

38:59.901 --> 39:02.070
"to the Tomb of the Dancing Light

39:02.196 --> 39:05.157
"where the first half of the triangle
is hidden."

39:05.241 --> 39:07.909
You must be there
at the exact moment

39:08.036 --> 39:11.246
of the second phase
of the planetary alignment.

39:11.372 --> 39:14.207
"You must hurry.
You have very little time.

39:14.292 --> 39:16.126
"And as the planets move
into alignment,

39:16.252 --> 39:18.670
"the world will be in great danger,

39:18.755 --> 39:22.674
"for the secret society
known as the Illuminati,

39:22.759 --> 39:25.385
"devious, dangerous men

39:25.470 --> 39:29.848
"who seek to fulfil an ancient prophecy
by reuniting the two halves

39:29.932 --> 39:34.853
"and attaining the triangle's awesome
and terrible powers.

39:34.937 --> 39:38.982
"This you must prevent at all costs.

39:39.233 --> 39:43.445
"So, Lara,
I am asking you to complete my work,

39:43.571 --> 39:48.158
"to find and destroy
both halves of the triangle."

39:51.496 --> 39:56.333
How are you going to get to Cambodia
and get the clock back in 15 hours?

39:56.459 --> 39:58.502
I'll be calling in a favour.

39:59.337 --> 40:02.589
- What kind of favour?
- Well, that is a secret.

40:02.673 --> 40:05.258
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.

40:15.187 --> 40:17.271
Lady Croft, are you on target? Over.

40:17.356 --> 40:20.483
Right on target. Thank you, boys.
Over and out.

41:01.984 --> 41:03.943
How predictable.

41:08.699 --> 41:10.700
Alex West.

41:11.494 --> 41:13.871
What are you doing here?

41:54.245 --> 41:57.498
We have 72 minutes
to the next alignment.

41:57.582 --> 41:59.500
We have to work faster.

42:10.887 --> 42:12.387
Come on, guys!

42:50.427 --> 42:53.721
Come on, guys! Come on. Pull!

42:53.806 --> 42:55.139
Pull! It's coming!

43:08.153 --> 43:09.279
Good.

43:42.272 --> 43:45.608
So, any sign of Lady Croft?

43:45.692 --> 43:47.276
Not yet.

43:47.360 --> 43:50.613
Lara's overrated.
She's good, don't get me wrong,

43:50.697 --> 43:53.115
but she's in it for the glory,

43:53.450 --> 43:55.701
whereas I'm in it for the money.

43:55.827 --> 43:57.953
Fortunately.

43:58.038 --> 44:01.665
- Into the belly of the beast.
- And out of the demon's ass.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.610
Jasmine.

46:57.178 --> 47:00.764
Remember, what we are looking for
is hidden not only in space,

47:00.848 --> 47:02.516
but also in time.

47:03.267 --> 47:05.101
The clock is the key.

47:14.612 --> 47:16.238
My God.

47:24.580 --> 47:27.582
"Return the iron
to the stone's embrace,

47:27.667 --> 47:29.709
"the wheel of heaven will turn.

47:29.794 --> 47:32.629
"Exhume the light
from its watery grave

47:33.923 --> 47:36.341
"to receive the gift of heaven

47:36.801 --> 47:39.928
"as you are condemned
to the depths of hell."

47:41.598 --> 47:46.018
Right. Pretty much touch anything
and you get your head chopped off.

47:47.479 --> 47:49.564
We have two minutes, Mr West.

47:49.648 --> 47:52.316
You're the tomb raider. Figure it out.

48:06.081 --> 48:07.123
Mr West.

48:08.667 --> 48:10.251
Tempus fugit.

48:11.712 --> 48:14.171
Yes, "time flies."

48:14.506 --> 48:16.632
It's the swords!

48:16.717 --> 48:20.136
Come on, guys. Get up here.
Give me a hand here.

48:24.933 --> 48:28.394
That's it. Come on. Coming down.

48:29.104 --> 48:31.188
I want them all down.

48:31.273 --> 48:33.691
Take them,
carry them across the ladders.

48:33.775 --> 48:35.610
Come on, guys. Let's hustle.

48:37.195 --> 48:41.157
All right.
Now slide them into the slots over there.

48:42.117 --> 48:45.703
We place the clock here
at the exact moment of alignment.

48:46.121 --> 48:48.498
Come on. Let's go! Move it!

48:50.793 --> 48:53.253
Too slow, ladies, too slow. Come on.

49:00.511 --> 49:02.554
- That's it.
- Count it down.

49:04.265 --> 49:07.017
- The timing needs to be exact.
- No shit.

49:31.834 --> 49:33.502
60 seconds to go.

49:34.170 --> 49:38.465
59, 58, 57,

49:38.549 --> 49:39.925
56,

49:40.009 --> 49:44.096
55, 54, 53,

49:44.472 --> 49:47.265
52, 51,

49:47.350 --> 49:49.393
50 seconds.

49:55.651 --> 49:58.486
Cease fire! Hold your fire!

50:03.200 --> 50:06.494
- Keep counting.
- You're making a big mistake!

50:06.745 --> 50:09.455
41, 40,

50:09.540 --> 50:11.165
- 39...
- Alex West.

50:11.250 --> 50:12.917
...38...
- Hey, Lara.

50:13.002 --> 50:14.627
...37...
- Tourist visa?

50:14.712 --> 50:17.547
- No, I'm working.
- Lady Croft, tell me,

50:17.631 --> 50:19.966
is there a good reason
why I just kept you alive?

50:20.050 --> 50:22.969
Yes. That is not the true eye.

50:24.304 --> 50:27.724
- This is the true eye.
- It's not, actually.

50:27.808 --> 50:29.267
- It's a mirror image.
- Miss Croft,

50:29.351 --> 50:32.437
I think you're trying to cheat me
out of my little ray of sunshine.

50:32.521 --> 50:34.522
Why would I try and cheat you out
of anything now?

50:34.606 --> 50:37.483
I need you to get the piece
so I can steal it from you later.

50:37.568 --> 50:39.902
You're bluffing.
Julius, make a mental note.

50:39.987 --> 50:42.447
Kill Miss Croft
if she attempts any such thing.

50:42.531 --> 50:44.407
Yes, sir, Mr Powell.

50:44.533 --> 50:45.616
Well, we can do it my way

50:45.701 --> 50:47.827
or we can all come back in time
for the next alignment

50:47.911 --> 50:50.163
and you are welcome
to try and kill me, then.

50:50.247 --> 50:53.291
In, oh, say another 5,000 years.

50:58.673 --> 51:01.759
Twelve, eleven,

51:01.843 --> 51:03.302
ten,

51:03.386 --> 51:05.804
nine, eight,

51:06.806 --> 51:11.185
seven, six, five,

51:12.979 --> 51:15.606
four, three,

51:16.900 --> 51:19.651
two, one,

51:22.363 --> 51:23.489
zero.

51:28.161 --> 51:30.329
Well, I guess she was right.

51:40.256 --> 51:42.424
The log must pierce the urn.

51:47.555 --> 51:49.181
Come on!

51:50.975 --> 51:53.727
It's slowing down.
It's never gonna make it.

52:10.996 --> 52:12.038
No.

52:44.113 --> 52:46.322
Pure light, fire and water.

53:39.628 --> 53:40.711
Croft!

54:18.042 --> 54:19.668
Get the clock.

54:19.752 --> 54:21.002
Got it.

55:20.272 --> 55:21.522
Blast!

59:20.723 --> 59:22.516
Hold it right there!

59:25.103 --> 59:28.605
Lara, give it up.

59:29.899 --> 59:32.234
Are you going to shoot me, Alex?

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:33.630
My phone is wet.

01:00:43.642 --> 01:00:44.892
Yes?

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.144
Lady Croft, how are you?

01:00:47.646 --> 01:00:48.812
Alive.

01:00:49.064 --> 01:00:50.564
And kicking, I hope.

01:00:51.191 --> 01:00:53.317
- And you?
- Superlative.

01:00:53.485 --> 01:00:56.987
Of course, I digress.
You have my half of the triangle.

01:00:57.113 --> 01:00:59.281
And you have my father's clock.

01:00:59.366 --> 01:01:02.660
Listen, my dear. Without each other
we are quite useless at this point.

01:01:03.036 --> 01:01:05.412
We should reevaluate our positions.

01:01:05.497 --> 01:01:08.082
Like it or not,
you and I are in business together.

01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:09.833
We should have a business meeting.

01:01:09.918 --> 01:01:14.338
You mean you'd love to have
another opportunity to try and kill me.

01:01:14.422 --> 01:01:16.173
Oh, that's harsh.

01:01:17.175 --> 01:01:19.760
But perhaps. Wait and see.

01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:23.222
Come to Venice, Via Dolorosa.

01:01:23.765 --> 01:01:26.183
Wonderful. Bye then.

01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:31.689
Harder.

01:01:35.235 --> 01:01:37.444
Here it comes. Hide, everybody.

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:40.197
Look out. It's some sort of machine.

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:44.034
Bryce, it's me.

01:01:44.411 --> 01:01:47.372
- Hello?
- Bryce, it's Lara. I found the temple.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.583
- Ran into Mr Powell.
- Did you get the clock?

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:53.378
No, but I got the first piece.

01:01:53.796 --> 01:01:55.213
Oh, beautiful, smashing.

01:01:55.297 --> 01:01:57.632
Seems I'm level pegging
with Mr Powell.

01:01:57.717 --> 01:01:59.467
Well, won't he just want to kill you now?

01:01:59.552 --> 01:02:00.593
No, silly.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.972
His problem is that he needs the piece
that I have.

01:02:04.056 --> 01:02:07.058
Until then, I'm his new best friend.

01:02:07.143 --> 01:02:09.477
What about the other half?
The final alignment

01:02:09.562 --> 01:02:12.897
is in 66 hours and 53 minutes,
and we've still got no idea

01:02:12.982 --> 01:02:15.650
where the second piece is hidden.

01:02:15.818 --> 01:02:18.278
He's going to tell me
where the second piece is.

01:02:18.446 --> 01:02:21.656
- He will?
- Bryce, trust me. Pack for Venice.

01:02:21.782 --> 01:02:24.492
Pack for where? Hello? Lara?

01:02:27.413 --> 01:02:28.663
Bye then.

01:02:58.779 --> 01:02:59.862
Drink.

01:03:03.658 --> 01:03:04.784
Rest.

01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:08.829
There's no rest for the wicked.

01:03:09.664 --> 01:03:11.707
You got what you came for?

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.043
- I did, yes.
- Too bad.

01:03:14.669 --> 01:03:16.295
Bad for the world.

01:03:16.838 --> 01:03:18.380
The world is safe now.

01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:21.884
Little bit safer, perhaps,

01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:24.970
because you will go on.

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:27.556
Your father said you will never give up.

01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:31.143
My father? You knew my father?

01:03:32.395 --> 01:03:33.729
Now, drink.

01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:35.815
Finish your tea.

01:03:37.859 --> 01:03:42.071
It tastes quite bad, but it is good for you.

01:03:43.198 --> 01:03:44.240
See?

01:04:24.115 --> 01:04:25.574
Good evening.

01:04:28.953 --> 01:04:31.121
You're with the Illuminati.

01:04:34.083 --> 01:04:35.458
Beg your pardon?

01:04:35.835 --> 01:04:39.129
There's no such thing.
It's just a bedtime story.

01:04:46.596 --> 01:04:47.971
Illuminati.

01:04:49.473 --> 01:04:51.433
The people of the light.

01:04:53.769 --> 01:04:55.770
Have you brought my triangle?

01:04:56.188 --> 01:05:00.108
No, of course you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.

01:05:01.611 --> 01:05:03.946
Well, you can keep the triangle
you have

01:05:04.448 --> 01:05:08.117
and I will keep your father's clock,
and we can be partners.

01:05:08.327 --> 01:05:10.036
Who sits here?

01:05:12.122 --> 01:05:14.457
We can be partners
and go for the big prize,

01:05:15.375 --> 01:05:16.918
the Triangle of Light.

01:05:17.002 --> 01:05:19.962
Yes, but who sits here?

01:05:21.048 --> 01:05:24.508
It's an incredible dream,
an awesome power.

01:05:25.218 --> 01:05:27.178
It could set right so many wrongs.

01:05:29.056 --> 01:05:31.223
I don't think you sit here, do you?

01:05:42.486 --> 01:05:44.320
I sit here

01:05:45.238 --> 01:05:47.698
on God's right hand, as it were.

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:51.035
In fact,

01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:55.164
I now sit exactly where your father sat.

01:05:59.503 --> 01:06:00.670
You're lying.

01:06:01.171 --> 01:06:05.716
No. No, he mentored me in the order.

01:06:07.845 --> 01:06:09.388
It was truly an honour.

01:06:10.765 --> 01:06:12.349
I don't believe you.

01:06:14.435 --> 01:06:15.978
My father was not with the Illuminati.

01:06:16.062 --> 01:06:18.730
- He would have told me.
- He had a great many secrets.

01:06:22.527 --> 01:06:23.902
Not from me.

01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:26.196
Especially from you.

01:06:31.202 --> 01:06:32.869
I know what you want, Lara.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.622
Oh, I doubt it.

01:06:45.133 --> 01:06:47.384
Another life with your father,

01:06:48.428 --> 01:06:50.137
a second chance.

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:53.432
It'll be within my power to give.

01:06:54.809 --> 01:06:57.060
The triangle gives its possessor

01:06:58.438 --> 01:07:00.272
the power of God,

01:07:00.648 --> 01:07:05.569
to move back and forth through time,
undo the past.

01:07:06.654 --> 01:07:10.657
Help me, and you will get
what I know you want,

01:07:11.075 --> 01:07:13.286
to have your father returned to you.

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:20.918
And how do I know
once I gave you that piece

01:07:21.128 --> 01:07:23.463
that you wouldn't then just try to kill me?

01:07:26.633 --> 01:07:29.135
Would it make it easier for you

01:07:29.762 --> 01:07:33.598
on more familiar ground,
if I killed you now?

01:07:35.768 --> 01:07:37.351
Will you reconsider?

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.416
- Hello, Alex.
- I suppose you think

01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:43.292
I'm a greedy, unscrupulous sellout

01:08:43.377 --> 01:08:46.337
- and do about anything for money.
- Yes, that's right.

01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:50.175
Well, the money bit's true, I guess.

01:08:54.721 --> 01:08:56.515
Is it, Alex?

01:08:56.850 --> 01:09:00.853
If you cross me,
we may not be able to remain friends.

01:09:05.524 --> 01:09:07.067
Always a pleasure.

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:12.613
Now for a cold shower.

01:09:14.075 --> 01:09:15.492
I think we're in big trouble.

01:09:15.577 --> 01:09:16.910
- Hold this, will you?
- Thank you.

01:09:17.203 --> 01:09:20.538
They... They already think that we have
Lady Croft's piece of the triangle.

01:09:20.622 --> 01:09:23.585
Yes. They think it's in that box
you're carrying right now.

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:26.712
Is it?

01:09:26.881 --> 01:09:28.590
Why don't you worry
about something else?

01:09:28.716 --> 01:09:30.216
Of course it's not.

01:09:30.968 --> 01:09:34.761
I don't understand. What chance of
success do we have without the piece?

01:09:35.096 --> 01:09:37.307
Zero. Don't dwell on it.

01:09:37.433 --> 01:09:38.474
But...

01:09:42.604 --> 01:09:43.770
Lady Croft.

01:09:46.274 --> 01:09:47.984
What a nice surprise.

01:09:50.613 --> 01:09:52.071
Thank you.

01:09:54.825 --> 01:09:57.744
Now, time to save
the universe again then, is it?

01:09:57.953 --> 01:09:59.412
Absolutely.

01:10:33.949 --> 01:10:36.617
Are we sure she's really necessary?

01:10:37.494 --> 01:10:40.704
Well, one tomb raider is good.
Two, better.

01:10:49.297 --> 01:10:52.800
Me bum's gone to sleep again,
all down the left cheek.

01:10:52.968 --> 01:10:55.344
Really? That's fascinating.

01:11:01.685 --> 01:11:03.811
- How much longer?
- A few hours.

01:11:04.312 --> 01:11:06.438
We have to take the last hour over land.

01:11:06.523 --> 01:11:09.024
Helicopters won't fly
near the ruined city.

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.194
It's a dead zone.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.573
We take all doggies.

01:11:57.742 --> 01:12:00.201
Much-o U.S. Greenback.

01:12:01.245 --> 01:12:02.746
All doggies.

01:13:56.446 --> 01:13:58.113
Welcome to the dead zone.

01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:15.714
It's not a country. It's an ice cube!

01:14:19.385 --> 01:14:20.969
Come on!

01:15:49.726 --> 01:15:51.811
All right. Let's go.

01:16:44.991 --> 01:16:46.366
Go on, get it!

01:16:54.167 --> 01:16:55.667
Holy shit.

01:16:57.629 --> 01:17:01.799
It's a time storm. Time is broken here.

01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:05.720
We must find the eye! All of you! Hurry!

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:08.973
We're running out of time! Hurry! Hurry!

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:29.661
It's begun.

01:17:32.873 --> 01:17:35.208
$50 says the piece is inside the sun.

01:18:19.003 --> 01:18:23.048
For God's sake, hurry! The eclipse
will be over in a few minutes!

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:33.350
Alex, give me the clock.
I know what to do.

01:19:28.199 --> 01:19:29.741
Has she got the piece?

01:19:40.169 --> 01:19:41.586
We will now

01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:44.172
unite these two parts,

01:19:44.757 --> 01:19:47.425
the past and the present.

01:19:48.594 --> 01:19:51.679
At last, we of the Illuminati

01:19:51.764 --> 01:19:55.266
will control time
and fulfil the sacred promise

01:19:55.434 --> 01:19:56.976
to our ancestors.

01:19:57.603 --> 01:20:01.689
- Soon, the entire world will bow...
- Enough of this twaddle.

01:20:07.738 --> 01:20:08.947
Go on! Go on!

01:20:36.059 --> 01:20:38.394
Not quite what you hoped for,
Mr Powell?

01:20:43.066 --> 01:20:44.191
Lara,

01:20:46.152 --> 01:20:48.362
I have a gut instinct about this.

01:20:50.115 --> 01:20:52.825
After all, you are the daughter
of a genius.

01:20:52.951 --> 01:20:54.577
Let me test my theory.

01:21:46.047 --> 01:21:49.716
You had to let him go.
No more bubbles.

01:21:50.593 --> 01:21:52.886
You show me
how to complete the triangle,

01:21:53.638 --> 01:21:55.513
we can change his fate.

01:21:56.724 --> 01:22:00.352
If you deliver me the power of God,
I will spare him.

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:02.938
It's only a little trip back in time.

01:22:03.731 --> 01:22:08.401
But I'm pretty sure you've figured out
the answer to the problem.

01:22:10.112 --> 01:22:13.573
And then, of course,
there's the loss of your father.

01:22:13.866 --> 01:22:15.241
I can change that.

01:22:29.883 --> 01:22:31.092
You'd better be ready for this.

01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:40.768
- Unhook your laser sight.
- Do it.

01:23:17.723 --> 01:23:20.182
"To see a world in a grain of sand."

01:23:53.342 --> 01:23:54.509
Daddy?

01:23:59.515 --> 01:24:00.557
Lara.

01:24:03.853 --> 01:24:05.062
Is this real?

01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:08.648
It is a crossing

01:24:09.817 --> 01:24:11.943
of my past and your present.

01:24:12.695 --> 01:24:14.905
Why did you not tell me
about the Illuminati?

01:24:15.531 --> 01:24:17.240
You were only a child.

01:24:17.325 --> 01:24:19.201
You could have written in your journals.

01:24:19.285 --> 01:24:23.205
- You never mentioned it, not once.
- Lara, I burst to tell you everything.

01:24:23.706 --> 01:24:26.041
But in the fierceness
of my own battles,

01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:28.919
I strove to tell you
only that which would inspire you

01:24:29.003 --> 01:24:30.587
and keep you safe.

01:24:31.881 --> 01:24:33.841
I love you so much.

01:24:35.177 --> 01:24:36.677
But I've missed you.

01:24:38.097 --> 01:24:39.847
And I have missed you.

01:24:43.102 --> 01:24:45.019
I know why you came here,

01:24:45.104 --> 01:24:48.356
why you took the power of the light,
but this must not happen.

01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:52.276
Why? Why can't we use the power
just this once?

01:24:54.196 --> 01:24:55.696
Why can't you stay?

01:24:56.323 --> 01:24:58.950
We can't change time.

01:25:00.285 --> 01:25:02.161
But time was stolen from us

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.040
and it's not fair.

01:25:06.542 --> 01:25:08.709
No, it's not fair.

01:25:09.711 --> 01:25:11.796
But you have stolen time itself

01:25:12.506 --> 01:25:14.799
and you must give it back.

01:25:16.552 --> 01:25:18.886
You must destroy the triangle.

01:25:21.056 --> 01:25:22.807
Suddenly I feel so alone.

01:25:24.184 --> 01:25:29.021
You're never alone. I am with you
always, just as I've always been.

01:26:56.403 --> 01:26:57.445
No.

01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:13.002
Move out!

01:27:22.471 --> 01:27:23.554
Lara.

01:27:25.391 --> 01:27:26.516
Wait!

01:27:28.018 --> 01:27:29.727
Your father begged for his life

01:27:29.853 --> 01:27:31.729
when we caught him betraying us.

01:27:31.855 --> 01:27:34.565
He pleaded like a baby.

01:27:34.692 --> 01:27:35.900
Surrender.

01:27:38.028 --> 01:27:39.320
Never.

01:27:42.825 --> 01:27:47.412
He seemed particularly concerned
that I shouldn't take this.

01:27:53.169 --> 01:27:56.338
Lara, no! The place is coming down!

01:27:56.423 --> 01:27:59.425
- This is insane!
- Get them out of here.

01:28:04.389 --> 01:28:05.723
You just hurry.

01:28:17.902 --> 01:28:19.528
There you go,

01:28:19.904 --> 01:28:21.363
safe and sound.

01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:33.917
No guns.

01:31:31.641 --> 01:31:32.933
Oh, my God!

01:31:35.937 --> 01:31:37.354
Quiet.
