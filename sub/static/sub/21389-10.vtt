WEBVTT

00:00.075 --> 00:01.668
Previously on "Midnight, Texas"...

00:01.702 --> 00:03.420
The veil between the living and the dead

00:03.435 --> 00:05.226
- is awful thin here.
- I think you're gonna

00:05.250 --> 00:07.132
lead an army and seal the veil forever.

00:07.148 --> 00:09.384
It's your destiny. I got a vision.

00:09.407 --> 00:12.468
Midnight in flames
and you in the center,

00:12.515 --> 00:14.299
the only one to stop it.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.482
You need to go back.

00:15.518 --> 00:17.972
If I don't, they all die?

00:18.007 --> 00:19.323
You came back.

00:19.335 --> 00:21.034
You and I, we've got
unfinished business.

00:21.077 --> 00:22.534
I'm here because of her.

00:22.581 --> 00:24.579
I don't want to be turned.

00:24.613 --> 00:26.394
Once you turn, you'll like it.

00:27.616 --> 00:29.527
Olivia, I'm so...

00:29.543 --> 00:30.699
Back off!

00:30.730 --> 00:31.980
Despite what happened,

00:32.021 --> 00:33.021
I love you.

00:33.055 --> 00:35.023
As soon as Fiji's safe,

00:35.057 --> 00:36.491
I'm leaving Midnight.

00:36.525 --> 00:37.738
Fiji...

00:37.770 --> 00:40.028
Colconnar, he's chosen you.

00:40.069 --> 00:41.895
There's no way in hell
I'm letting this thing

00:41.931 --> 00:44.165
get anywhere near you, I promise, Fij.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.567
I'm a virgin witch, a
powerful virgin witch,

00:46.613 --> 00:48.261
and that is why it wants me.

00:48.295 --> 00:49.528
Your emotions...

00:51.282 --> 00:53.249
- You need to control them.
- Jeremy?

00:53.277 --> 00:56.111
Colconnar sent me because
he knew you'd listen to me.

00:56.145 --> 00:59.047
Go to him willingly, or they all die.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.983 --> 01:36.618
We know where they're taking her.

01:36.652 --> 01:39.087
Going back to Midnight,
bringing her to Colconnar.

01:39.121 --> 01:40.989
To use her.

01:41.023 --> 01:43.152
When the demons came
through the veil last time,

01:43.191 --> 01:45.665
they used women to
go forth and multiply.

01:45.696 --> 01:47.228
That thing wants to...

01:47.263 --> 01:49.264
It wants to have sex with her.

01:49.298 --> 01:50.665
Which is utterly awful.

01:50.699 --> 01:52.267
But not surprising.

01:52.301 --> 01:54.766
Fiji's as powerful a natural
witch as I've ever seen.

01:54.807 --> 01:56.574
All the more powerful
because she hasn't...

01:56.610 --> 01:58.239
Yes, we know. She's a virgin.

01:58.274 --> 01:59.773
I don't give a damn why it wants her.

01:59.775 --> 02:01.959
It's not gonna lay a finger or a claw

02:01.990 --> 02:03.733
or whatever the hell it has on her.

02:03.764 --> 02:05.580
We won't let it.

02:16.824 --> 02:18.291
What has he done?

02:18.325 --> 02:21.060
You can feel him, can't you?

02:24.198 --> 02:25.798
Getting closer,

02:25.833 --> 02:27.300
stronger.

02:32.206 --> 02:33.840
- Oh, God, is that it?
- Not yet.

02:33.874 --> 02:35.308
He will come to you tonight.

02:35.342 --> 02:37.844
Fiji...

02:37.878 --> 02:41.280
Colconnar is very eager to meet you.

02:43.817 --> 02:45.451
When I died,

02:45.486 --> 02:47.857
the shaman said the
first demon was gonna rise

02:47.889 --> 02:51.121
on the night of a blood
moon, that's tonight.

02:51.168 --> 02:53.143
Well, besides the creepy
name, what does that mean?

02:53.145 --> 02:54.894
Xylda and I wouldn't even do readings

02:54.928 --> 02:56.462
on nights of blood moons.

02:56.497 --> 02:58.464
They create a potent psychic environment

02:58.499 --> 03:00.333
that can be a conduit for evil.

03:00.367 --> 03:01.567
It's too dangerous.

03:01.602 --> 03:03.236
It's also a full moon.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.804
This just keeps getting better.

03:04.838 --> 03:06.339
Fiji's spell worked.

03:06.373 --> 03:07.974
I know how to kill Colconnar.

03:10.911 --> 03:13.012
Oh, God.

03:13.047 --> 03:15.415
Colconnar sent them to guard you.

03:15.449 --> 03:17.884
Creek, Olivia, Bobo,

03:17.918 --> 03:19.819
you guys find Fiji.

03:19.853 --> 03:21.832
Keep her safe until Colconnar's gone.

03:21.871 --> 03:23.256
Done.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.566
How are you gonna kill it?

03:24.598 --> 03:26.387
- Details aren't important.
- Aren't they?

03:26.434 --> 03:28.835
Before we worry about killing Colconnar,

03:28.871 --> 03:31.067
what are we gonna do about the wraiths?

03:31.098 --> 03:32.365
They barely touched me...

03:32.399 --> 03:34.534
burned right through my
clothes, hurt like hell.

03:34.568 --> 03:37.270
What kind of weapons did we bring?

03:37.304 --> 03:40.440
This is everything.

03:40.474 --> 03:43.042
Wraiths are spirit
manifestations of evil.

03:43.077 --> 03:45.344
An ax isn't gonna cut it.

03:45.379 --> 03:47.380
I'm thinking we go old school.

03:47.414 --> 03:49.449
They're evil.

03:49.477 --> 03:51.180
Evil doesn't like holy water.

03:51.214 --> 03:52.766
It burns, they recoil.

03:52.805 --> 03:54.583
We clear a path to Fiji.

03:54.618 --> 03:55.718
Will this do?

03:55.752 --> 03:57.586
Yeah, I can sanctify this

03:57.621 --> 03:59.322
and bless these weapons.

03:59.361 --> 04:01.423
While they're with Fiji,
we head to the pawn shop.

04:01.425 --> 04:04.693
Why the pawn shop?

04:04.728 --> 04:06.695
There's stuff there I need.

04:13.737 --> 04:14.823
Hey.

04:17.908 --> 04:19.478
Are you gonna be okay

04:19.502 --> 04:22.311
using consecrated weapons?

04:22.345 --> 04:25.214
Over the years, I've developed
a tolerance for holy water.

04:25.248 --> 04:26.976
At most, it stings.

04:27.013 --> 04:28.617
Wow, I hate to break it to you,

04:28.644 --> 04:30.312
but you're just not that evil.

04:32.789 --> 04:34.390
It can't be easy for you,

04:34.424 --> 04:36.659
knowing what Colconnar intends for Fiji.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.403
Nothing's going to happen to her.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.514
You look tired.

04:41.536 --> 04:43.273
You need energy?

04:43.294 --> 04:46.302
Or do you need to not be scared?

04:46.336 --> 04:48.671
Maybe.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.840
But we're not together anymore, so...

04:50.874 --> 04:53.809
probably not the best idea.

04:53.844 --> 04:55.678
There's something you're not telling me.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.447
How exactly are you
planning to kill Colconnar?

04:58.482 --> 04:59.915
- Details aren't...
- Important?

04:59.950 --> 05:01.917
You said that.

05:01.952 --> 05:03.686
You're trying to spare me, aren't you?

05:03.720 --> 05:04.854
Look, we're gonna do this,

05:04.888 --> 05:06.255
whatever the risks are.

05:06.289 --> 05:07.990
So, yeah, I'm trying to spare you.

05:08.024 --> 05:09.570
And I'd appreciate it if you let me.

05:09.585 --> 05:11.427
Fine. Spare me.

05:11.461 --> 05:13.179
But don't die this time.

05:13.221 --> 05:14.221
Deal.

05:17.434 --> 05:19.898
It's time you prepare
yourself for his arrival.

05:19.932 --> 05:23.435
You look... unworthy.

05:23.477 --> 05:25.278
Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy...

05:25.304 --> 05:26.871
If there's any part of you

05:26.914 --> 05:30.016
in there, your heart, your kindness,

05:30.034 --> 05:31.601
please don't let him do this to me.

05:31.629 --> 05:33.861
There is no part of me that's Jeremy.

05:40.023 --> 05:41.857
You're one of them.

05:41.892 --> 05:44.693
Colconnar was in my head...

05:46.090 --> 05:48.495
In my sleep, in my dreams.

05:48.532 --> 05:51.700
It's how Colconnar knows you.

05:51.735 --> 05:52.968
Which means...

05:54.504 --> 05:55.971
We all know you.

05:58.601 --> 06:00.335
We're a reminder.

06:00.353 --> 06:02.688
You're not all that
different from Colconnar.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.766
Your powers destroy. They kill.

06:05.789 --> 06:08.817
Just like his.

06:08.852 --> 06:11.487
It's time you got ready for him.

06:28.905 --> 06:32.374
Don't cry...

06:32.409 --> 06:34.923
Fiji.

06:34.963 --> 06:36.731
He's right.

06:40.417 --> 06:44.086
I have to get ready.

07:01.104 --> 07:03.564
Okay, we save Fiji,

07:03.603 --> 07:04.603
kill a demon,

07:04.630 --> 07:06.731
close a portal to hell.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.545
And we don't die. Sound like a plan?

07:09.579 --> 07:12.481
My flesh is burning. Stop talking.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.916
Let's go.

07:24.259 --> 07:29.228
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

07:35.796 --> 07:37.430
They're in front of the church.

07:37.464 --> 07:39.365
Looks like all the wraiths are by you.

07:39.399 --> 07:40.714
Yeah, looks like.

07:40.753 --> 07:43.756
And they look different,
like more solid.

07:43.811 --> 07:44.837
Doesn't matter.

07:44.871 --> 07:46.505
They're still spirit manifestations.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.374
They can take any shape they want.

07:48.408 --> 07:50.530
They're evil, and
consecrated weapons will work.

07:50.545 --> 07:53.379
Any idea what they're doing?

07:53.413 --> 07:55.381
On second thought, never mind.

07:55.415 --> 07:56.895
They'll distract the wraiths for us.

07:56.917 --> 07:58.017
How?

08:02.322 --> 08:03.956
Well, that was effective.

08:05.826 --> 08:07.393
But not for that long.

08:17.471 --> 08:18.471
It's clear.

08:18.505 --> 08:20.873
Let's go.

08:22.986 --> 08:24.944
Damn it. Go to Fiji's.

08:24.978 --> 08:26.217
I'll make sure you're covered.

08:26.220 --> 08:27.947
- Olivia!
- Go!

08:31.118 --> 08:32.885
Get inside the pawn shop!

08:45.332 --> 08:46.832
Come on. Let's go inside.

08:50.337 --> 08:51.570
- Fiji!
- Open up!

08:51.605 --> 08:52.571
It's us!

08:55.375 --> 08:56.575
Fiji!

08:56.610 --> 08:58.044
Creek, Bobo, what are you...

08:59.604 --> 09:01.873
You should not have come back.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.155
I left so that you would be safe,

09:04.185 --> 09:05.776
so that what happened to
Manfred would not happen to...

09:05.778 --> 09:07.069
Nothing happened.

09:07.089 --> 09:09.123
He died, but he came back to life.

09:09.157 --> 09:10.782
And your spell worked. He got answers.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.485
Oh, okay. Well, thank
goddess he's alive.

09:13.519 --> 09:16.988
But still, I do not want
anybody else getting hurt!

09:17.023 --> 09:19.057
No. Manfred knows how to stop Colconnar.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.225
We're not leaving you.

09:20.259 --> 09:21.899
Maybe I want you to.

09:21.938 --> 09:24.062
I can deal with Colconnar.

09:24.096 --> 09:27.132
But I cannot deal with you dying for me.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.467
Olivia's coming.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.255
Get her on the couch!

09:53.125 --> 09:54.526
Gonna be all right, okay?

09:54.560 --> 09:56.127
Fiji's gonna take care of you.

10:28.594 --> 10:30.295
No!

10:36.168 --> 10:38.803
Manfred...

10:38.838 --> 10:40.572
Manfred...

10:40.606 --> 10:41.706
Manfred!

10:45.611 --> 10:47.712
What exactly are you looking for?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.848
The shaman said that to fight evil,

10:49.882 --> 10:51.816
I need to know evil.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.818
There are spirits

10:53.853 --> 10:56.821
tethered to objects here.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.691
Some of them are evil.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.560
You think any of them are demonic?

11:01.594 --> 11:03.261
I'm sure,

11:03.296 --> 11:05.764
given some of the folks,
supernatural and otherwise,

11:05.798 --> 11:07.766
who pawned things over the years.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.570
Let me see what I can find.

11:21.380 --> 11:22.781
She's in a lot of pain.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.382
I know that.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.118
My salve healed me, healed you.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.390
But Olivia's burns are deep.

11:29.429 --> 11:30.999
I'm not sure salve's gonna help her.

11:31.039 --> 11:32.390
Try.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.695
I really wish you'd have stayed away.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.802
You're gonna take this.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.370
It's gonna be a little gritty,

11:45.404 --> 11:47.857
but it's gonna make you sleepy

11:47.864 --> 11:49.407
and stop the hurt.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.243
Might even give you a fun dream or two.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.745
It's awful.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.213
I know.

11:55.247 --> 11:56.247
Let me take a look at...

11:58.351 --> 11:59.918
The wraith did a number on you.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.219
Mm.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.822
But you are an assassin.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.391
I'm sure you been in worse scrapes.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.295
It's Manfred.

12:10.329 --> 12:11.630
Don't tell him.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.143
Olivia.

12:13.174 --> 12:14.574
Lem would want to know the truth.

12:14.612 --> 12:16.301
It'll distract them.

12:16.335 --> 12:17.769
And they don't need that.

12:17.803 --> 12:20.238
I'm telling you.

12:20.272 --> 12:21.339
Don't.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.809
Manfred?

12:24.844 --> 12:26.678
Yeah, we made it to Fiji's.

12:26.712 --> 12:28.279
You don't need to worry about her.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.781
She's okay.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.916
You just focus on Colconnar, okay?

12:31.951 --> 12:34.319
'Cause nightfall's not far off.

12:34.353 --> 12:35.687
Thank you.

12:35.721 --> 12:36.988
You're right. Okay.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.425
Love you.

12:40.459 --> 12:42.159
And, uh, yes,

12:42.190 --> 12:43.762
I know that's a first.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.363
Did you say that because

12:45.398 --> 12:47.265
you don't think you're
gonna survive this?

12:47.299 --> 12:49.200
Does it matter?

12:49.235 --> 12:50.669
No.

12:50.703 --> 12:51.870
I love you too.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.603
You wanted evil.

13:12.728 --> 13:15.883
A, by all accounts, happy
and successful family man

13:15.917 --> 13:17.665
found that on a hike.

13:17.704 --> 13:21.489
That afternoon, he beat his
wife and six children to death.

13:21.523 --> 13:23.290
Said a demon made him do it.

13:23.325 --> 13:25.459
Sounds perfect.

13:25.494 --> 13:27.228
Help me, help me...

13:27.262 --> 13:29.897
No!

13:29.931 --> 13:31.332
Why are they crying?

13:31.366 --> 13:32.867
Iron spider.

13:32.901 --> 13:35.469
Used to torture witches
during the Inquisition.

13:39.841 --> 13:41.342
Voodoo hoof rattle.

13:43.211 --> 13:45.212
What is it?

13:45.247 --> 13:48.883
It's like an ice pick behind my eye.

13:48.917 --> 13:51.185
Man, I miss my pills.

13:56.758 --> 13:58.192
Will this help?

14:03.398 --> 14:06.200
Any port in a storm.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.372
So how exactly do you plan to know evil?

14:11.406 --> 14:14.909
I plan to let evil hijack me.

14:16.411 --> 14:19.780
These are ancient,
malevolent, demonic spirits.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.549
Yep, that's the idea.

14:21.583 --> 14:22.750
It could kill you.

14:22.784 --> 14:25.419
Let's hope it doesn't.

14:28.390 --> 14:31.099
Do you want some blood?

14:31.130 --> 14:32.760
My blood?

14:32.794 --> 14:36.230
Thanks, but no thanks.

14:36.264 --> 14:39.767
Vampires aren't exactly
efficient against demons.

14:39.801 --> 14:41.769
I know.

14:41.803 --> 14:45.239
And, no, it wasn't to turn you, Manfred.

14:45.273 --> 14:47.408
I'd have to feed on you for that.

14:47.442 --> 14:51.045
Vampire blood makes humans
stronger, heal faster.

14:51.079 --> 14:53.047
There are side effects, but

14:53.081 --> 14:56.584
being possessed by demons
could have side effects too.

14:56.618 --> 14:58.986
I'll stick to this.

15:02.290 --> 15:04.558
I have some more items in
the basement, if you want.

15:04.593 --> 15:06.560
These... these will be enough.

15:06.595 --> 15:07.928
Okay.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.814
She's burning up.

15:19.838 --> 15:22.324
I'm worried about infection.
She should be in a hospital.

15:22.346 --> 15:23.799
Well, then, why don't we all leave?

15:23.830 --> 15:25.112
'Cause the last time I left,

15:25.135 --> 15:27.314
Colconnar sent those
things to bring me back.

15:27.349 --> 15:30.484
I'm not putting Olivia
in any more danger for me.

15:30.518 --> 15:32.586
I'll go. Bobo, you stay here.

15:32.621 --> 15:34.140
Go, go with them.

15:34.179 --> 15:35.623
I'm not going anywhere,

15:35.657 --> 15:37.358
except to bring your car around.

15:37.392 --> 15:38.525
You get her ready.

15:53.716 --> 15:55.376
The veil tearing again...

15:55.410 --> 15:57.111
must bring back memories for you.

15:57.145 --> 15:58.979
Not good ones.

15:59.014 --> 16:00.648
I hated being a soldier.

16:00.682 --> 16:02.516
Bowie said that we were fighting to

16:02.550 --> 16:05.653
exterminate those inferior to us.

16:05.687 --> 16:07.388
Never seemed worth the bloodshed.

16:07.422 --> 16:09.657
But this battle, it's different.

16:09.691 --> 16:11.959
It's worth it.

16:11.993 --> 16:15.629
Because now Midnight's home.

16:15.664 --> 16:17.865
Would you like me to
consecrate this for you?

16:44.392 --> 16:45.644
Are you okay?

16:45.691 --> 16:48.061
I have a sinking feeling
I'm about to lose everything.

16:48.063 --> 16:49.697
You're being pessimistic.

16:49.731 --> 16:51.699
I know the level of demonic evil

16:51.733 --> 16:54.501
Manfred's about to unleash.

16:54.536 --> 16:56.837
But I suppose these are desperate times.

16:58.573 --> 17:01.675
Desperate times

17:01.710 --> 17:04.377
can bring out the best in people.

17:04.412 --> 17:05.579
Like with you.

17:05.613 --> 17:07.217
It wasn't that long ago

17:07.240 --> 17:09.083
I kept my distance from everyone.

17:09.117 --> 17:11.959
- I was cordial, but...
- You ate alone.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.060
Until the night my wereself was let out.

17:14.089 --> 17:16.123
You searched for me.

17:16.156 --> 17:17.691
You could have put me down.

17:17.726 --> 17:19.593
But instead, everyone risked their lives

17:19.627 --> 17:21.948
to protect me from the
darkness inside myself.

17:21.987 --> 17:23.396
You're one of us.

17:23.431 --> 17:25.632
I know that now.

17:25.666 --> 17:28.068
Lem, we can use my church as sanctuary

17:28.103 --> 17:30.704
in case Colconnar cannot be stopped.

17:30.739 --> 17:32.973
I'm afraid that doesn't do me any good.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.675
I can help with that.

17:38.780 --> 17:40.647
What are you doing?

17:40.682 --> 17:42.716
I'm burning a healing candle,

17:42.751 --> 17:45.085
for Olivia.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.755
Don't look at me like
that. I'm willing it so.

17:47.789 --> 17:51.425
Like my Aunt Mildred would say,

17:51.459 --> 17:53.227
intentions can change reality.

17:59.634 --> 18:02.236
You said...

18:02.270 --> 18:06.106
that you could deal with Colconnar.

18:06.141 --> 18:08.175
What are you thinking?

18:10.678 --> 18:13.247
My powers can be destructive.

18:13.281 --> 18:16.250
I'm gonna use that.

18:16.284 --> 18:19.787
I'm going to do everything I can

18:19.821 --> 18:21.455
to protect Midnight,

18:21.489 --> 18:23.157
to protect all of you.

18:23.191 --> 18:25.125
I may not be strong enough,

18:25.160 --> 18:26.460
but I need you to let me try.

18:26.494 --> 18:28.095
Try what?

18:28.129 --> 18:30.764
Colconnar's been after me a long time.

18:30.799 --> 18:32.599
And he's not gonna stop.

18:32.634 --> 18:34.101
I'm gonna stop him.

18:34.135 --> 18:38.639
What aren't you telling me, Fij?

18:38.673 --> 18:41.275
I'm gonna give myself to him,

18:41.309 --> 18:43.467
and in the process, I'm
gonna try to kill him.

18:43.499 --> 18:44.756
That's insane.

18:44.795 --> 18:47.681
You have no idea how dangerous I am.

18:47.715 --> 18:49.283
I've done this before.

18:49.317 --> 18:51.485
Done what before? Done what before?

18:51.519 --> 18:53.654
- What have you done before?
- Killed someone!

18:57.826 --> 19:01.228
While... intimate, I killed someone.

19:01.262 --> 19:03.664
Fij...

19:03.698 --> 19:06.533
Please, will you just talk to me?

19:06.568 --> 19:08.035
What's going on?

19:08.069 --> 19:09.169
I loved him.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.175
And I killed him.

19:15.210 --> 19:18.045
I killed...

19:18.079 --> 19:21.048
I didn't mean to, but I did.

19:23.284 --> 19:25.319
His name was Jeremy.

19:25.353 --> 19:27.925
Have you ever been possessed
by a demonic spirit?

19:27.948 --> 19:31.117
Angry ex-husband? Yes. Demon? No.

19:31.144 --> 19:33.019
So you intend to be possessed

19:33.053 --> 19:35.555
by multiple demonic spirits
on the night of a blood moon?

19:35.596 --> 19:37.423
What happens if you can't control

19:37.436 --> 19:39.103
those spirits once they're inside you?

19:39.134 --> 19:41.103
Well, then, we're all
screwed, aren't we?

19:41.142 --> 19:42.902
Manfred, are you sure about this?

19:42.904 --> 19:44.171
Hell no, I'm not sure.

19:44.205 --> 19:45.706
But the prophecy says,

19:45.740 --> 19:48.075
a man of vision who
can bridge the worlds

19:48.109 --> 19:50.177
of the living and the dead, right?

19:50.211 --> 19:51.745
Never mentions what kind of dead,

19:51.779 --> 19:54.715
so this is the only way
that makes sense to me.

19:54.749 --> 19:56.717
So unless anyone else has a better idea,

19:56.743 --> 19:59.319
this is what we're going with.

19:59.342 --> 20:02.188
What do you need from us?

20:02.223 --> 20:04.892
Joe, Lem, if you can...

20:04.926 --> 20:07.794
stay close, in case I
can't control these demons?

20:07.829 --> 20:09.863
Rev, it's almost nightfall.

20:09.898 --> 20:11.865
Moon's about to rise, so...

20:11.900 --> 20:13.267
May I use your basement?

20:13.301 --> 20:14.829
Of course.

20:14.878 --> 20:16.379
I will pray for you

20:16.412 --> 20:18.113
until I turn.

20:20.642 --> 20:23.165
See you in the morning.

20:23.192 --> 20:25.751
Spirits tethered to these objects,

20:25.780 --> 20:27.814
I call to you.

20:29.951 --> 20:33.120
I want to release you from
your binds to this world.

20:37.258 --> 20:39.326
If you can hear me,

20:39.360 --> 20:42.262
give me a sign.

20:50.638 --> 20:52.773
I invite you,

20:52.807 --> 20:54.675
cross over,

20:54.709 --> 20:56.143
let me see you.

21:17.665 --> 21:18.832
Is it working?

21:20.201 --> 21:21.635
Oh, yeah, it is.

21:36.242 --> 21:38.817
We're gonna be there really soon, okay?

21:38.851 --> 21:40.351
I...

21:40.386 --> 21:43.988
I need you to give Lem a message.

21:44.023 --> 21:46.791
You can tell him yourself
as soon as you're better.

21:46.826 --> 21:48.359
This may not end happy.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.829
We don't know that.

21:56.869 --> 22:00.004
But in case it doesn't,
what's the message?

22:00.039 --> 22:02.200
I would have come back to him.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.017
I'm offering a way out.

22:14.787 --> 22:16.387
Help me,

22:16.422 --> 22:18.022
and you don't have to be tethered

22:18.057 --> 22:20.859
to this world anymore, in limbo.

22:20.893 --> 22:22.994
You can get out of this pawn shop.

22:23.028 --> 22:24.896
Move on.

22:33.439 --> 22:36.407
Come on.

22:36.442 --> 22:39.744
I want to make a deal.

22:51.157 --> 22:53.821
Should we intervene?

22:53.839 --> 22:55.071
No.

23:14.079 --> 23:17.248
But you didn't intend to hurt him.

23:17.283 --> 23:20.818
But I intend to hurt Colconnar.

23:20.853 --> 23:22.887
Gonna take all my anger

23:22.922 --> 23:26.090
and my hurt,

23:26.125 --> 23:29.093
and do to him what I did to Jeremy.

23:29.128 --> 23:32.830
He's a demon from hell.

23:32.872 --> 23:34.272
What you got planned

23:34.300 --> 23:38.102
isn't gonna work, you know that.

23:38.137 --> 23:41.940
But I got a better idea.

23:41.974 --> 23:43.975
Colconnar wants you because
you're a virgin witch,

23:44.009 --> 23:47.145
so instead of giving
Colconnar what he wants,

23:47.179 --> 23:49.514
how about you don't?

23:49.548 --> 23:51.473
What does that even mean?

23:51.504 --> 23:53.318
I think you know what it means.

23:55.154 --> 23:58.533
You're kidding, right?

24:01.160 --> 24:03.595
Wait, you're suggesting
that... that we...

24:03.629 --> 24:06.700
While... while the world's
ending right outside this door?

24:06.747 --> 24:08.866
Can't very well do it
after the world ends.

24:08.901 --> 24:10.301
This isn't funny.

24:10.336 --> 24:13.137
No, it's not. You're right.

24:15.975 --> 24:19.811
But it's something I've
thought about for a long time.

24:19.845 --> 24:23.615
Since that first day you
walked into the pawn shop

24:23.649 --> 24:26.951
with that plate of sand tarts.

24:26.986 --> 24:28.361
You remember the cookies?

24:28.401 --> 24:30.555
Of course I do.

24:30.589 --> 24:34.695
I thought you were out of my league.

24:34.726 --> 24:36.894
Shut up.

24:36.929 --> 24:38.863
You are beautiful

24:38.897 --> 24:41.165
and kind and funny.

24:45.104 --> 24:48.172
Don't tell me you
haven't thought about it.

24:52.211 --> 24:53.578
Of course I have.

24:56.382 --> 24:58.650
I just...

24:58.684 --> 25:01.252
never imagined it like this.

25:07.226 --> 25:08.693
What'd you imagine?

25:11.297 --> 25:14.032
Well...

25:14.066 --> 25:17.201
I thought...

25:17.236 --> 25:19.370
I thought I'd make you dinner.

25:21.607 --> 25:25.209
A roast.

25:25.244 --> 25:28.346
And twice-baked potatoes, maybe.

25:31.383 --> 25:34.319
Then, we'd watch a movie.

25:36.121 --> 25:39.891
I'd pick something scary so you'd...

25:39.925 --> 25:42.293
put your arm around me, but...

25:49.001 --> 25:50.948
Like this?

25:53.105 --> 25:55.073
Like that.

26:19.665 --> 26:22.433
You're not scared?

26:22.468 --> 26:26.337
You're not that same
girl you were back then.

26:26.372 --> 26:28.139
So no.

26:28.173 --> 26:29.407
Not one bit.

27:02.341 --> 27:05.510
Bring the virgin witch to me.

27:08.380 --> 27:10.615
Not gonna happen.

27:15.283 --> 27:17.994
Evil is making you powerful.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.018
Join us.

27:22.052 --> 27:23.919
Nah.

27:27.324 --> 27:29.258
I'll pass.

27:29.292 --> 27:31.193
Your mistake.

27:41.304 --> 27:42.905
Why don't you stop there?

27:42.939 --> 27:44.874
You're not laying a finger on her.

28:04.919 --> 28:06.052
I don't want to hurt you.

28:06.086 --> 28:09.189
You won't.

28:09.223 --> 28:11.758
And if you do,

28:11.792 --> 28:13.726
I will die happy.

28:13.761 --> 28:15.728
Bobo,

28:15.763 --> 28:17.897
this isn't a joke.

28:17.932 --> 28:20.066
I love you too much to hurt you.

28:20.100 --> 28:22.669
So don't.

28:22.703 --> 28:23.903
You will it so.

28:25.906 --> 28:30.677
Your magic is strong
because you are strong.

28:30.711 --> 28:35.014
Your love is strong.

28:35.049 --> 28:36.916
And I trust you,

28:36.951 --> 28:39.085
completely.

28:41.755 --> 28:43.957
So can we stop talking now?

29:08.115 --> 29:10.116
Fiji...

29:10.150 --> 29:12.719
What did you do?

29:12.760 --> 29:16.229
No!

29:18.125 --> 29:21.127
Now you all die.

29:52.359 --> 29:54.294
You need more power.

29:57.364 --> 29:59.046
Emilio, no!

30:07.074 --> 30:10.843
You don't belong here.

30:16.083 --> 30:17.884
Here, the man who sold it

30:17.918 --> 30:19.852
thought he was the devil himself.

30:43.277 --> 30:47.380
This is over.

30:55.389 --> 30:57.357
No!

31:09.136 --> 31:12.854
Get out of Midnight!

31:15.275 --> 31:17.310
No!

31:33.127 --> 31:35.395
You're free now.

31:35.429 --> 31:37.397
Get out of me

31:37.431 --> 31:40.066
and go to hell.

32:02.456 --> 32:05.291
Are you all right?

32:05.325 --> 32:07.427
I'm not sure.

32:07.461 --> 32:08.817
But Colconnar's gone.

32:08.856 --> 32:11.431
He is.

32:11.465 --> 32:12.965
You're safe.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.068
We all are. Thank you.

32:15.102 --> 32:17.904
Hey, Lem, there's
something you need to know.

32:27.314 --> 32:28.981
Hey.

32:29.016 --> 32:30.382
Uh, just with everything going on,

32:30.384 --> 32:31.984
I didn't know who else to call.

32:32.019 --> 32:33.550
Please, please. How's she doing?

32:33.589 --> 32:36.122
Uh, they say she has burn sepsis,

32:36.156 --> 32:38.847
and she's not responding
to the antibiotics

32:38.862 --> 32:42.462
and she might not make
it through the night.

32:42.496 --> 32:44.964
Oh, God. Okay.

33:00.304 --> 33:01.971
Creek.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.809
I'm sorry.

33:06.844 --> 33:08.177
She's hanging on, but they said

33:08.212 --> 33:11.848
there's nothing more they can do.

33:11.882 --> 33:13.756
She gave me a message for you.

33:13.779 --> 33:17.920
She can tell me herself. Where is she?

34:00.163 --> 34:01.998
I'm not dead.

34:02.032 --> 34:05.735
I healed you with a little blood.

34:05.769 --> 34:07.136
But I thought you said...

34:07.170 --> 34:10.005
Vampire blood's not good for humans.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.241
It isn't.

34:12.275 --> 34:13.976
But I couldn't lose you, Olivia.

34:14.011 --> 34:15.143
I'm sorry.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.079
You won't.

34:20.117 --> 34:21.391
Didn't mean to worry you.

34:21.415 --> 34:24.185
Things were touch-and-go for
a while, but she's strong.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.922
Your little girl's gonna be just fine.

34:26.956 --> 34:29.992
No, don't. Do not step foot in Midnight.

34:30.027 --> 34:33.029
You do, things will get ugly real fast.

34:33.063 --> 34:36.065
Now, trust me. I have my eyes on her.

34:44.107 --> 34:46.275
You're tempted, aren't you?

34:47.742 --> 34:50.045
Yeah, I am.

34:50.080 --> 34:53.248
You want to tell me
what you spared me from?

34:53.283 --> 34:57.787
I let demon spirits hijack my body.

34:57.821 --> 35:00.923
"Spirits," plural.

35:00.958 --> 35:02.959
Six.

35:02.993 --> 35:06.128
They helped me send
that thing back to hell.

35:06.163 --> 35:08.443
But I saw what they
saw, felt what they felt,

35:08.480 --> 35:10.448
and...

35:10.474 --> 35:12.802
that wasn't great.

35:12.836 --> 35:14.870
Sorry about that.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.683
Do you think it's time that you and I...

35:29.353 --> 35:31.594
Family isn't always about blood.

35:31.624 --> 35:33.692
Family are the people

35:33.735 --> 35:36.325
that accept you as you are,

35:36.360 --> 35:39.228
without judgment.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.263
The people that stand with you

35:41.298 --> 35:42.998
in joy and agony.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.971
With family, love doesn't
come with conditions.

35:49.006 --> 35:52.490
Sacrifices are made willingly,

35:52.513 --> 35:55.011
if only to spare your loved ones pain.

35:55.045 --> 35:59.348
And if you're exceptionally lucky,

35:59.383 --> 36:01.417
you're born into that.

36:01.451 --> 36:03.352
But sometimes not.

36:03.387 --> 36:06.355
- Oh, my God, I'm so late.
- Sometimes it takes

36:06.390 --> 36:09.258
a long time to find that family.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.327
Most of us know what
it's like to be alone,

36:11.361 --> 36:13.000
solitary.

36:13.039 --> 36:16.165
But because we know
loneliness, we recognize

36:16.199 --> 36:20.936
the miracle, the magic,

36:20.971 --> 36:22.371
committing to that family,

36:22.406 --> 36:24.633
for good or bad,

36:24.649 --> 36:26.375
sickness or health,

36:26.410 --> 36:30.279
aging and not.

36:35.713 --> 36:38.095
It's time to exchange the rings.

36:41.058 --> 36:42.391
Don't worry.

36:42.426 --> 36:44.393
Platinum...

36:44.428 --> 36:45.995
Not silver.

37:01.178 --> 37:04.380
In over a century, I never married.

37:04.414 --> 37:07.416
You are an adventure, Olivia Charity.

37:07.451 --> 37:09.482
Mm.

37:09.515 --> 37:10.649
Well,

37:10.685 --> 37:14.490
most men, my father included,

37:14.524 --> 37:17.927
they're the reason I do
what I do for a living.

37:17.961 --> 37:19.995
They made me angry

37:20.030 --> 37:22.098
and violent and cold,

37:22.132 --> 37:25.234
but you,

37:25.268 --> 37:26.435
dead guy...

37:28.848 --> 37:32.817
You came along and made me human again.

37:32.856 --> 37:34.443
My pleasure.

37:37.481 --> 37:39.348
I don't feel anything.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.384
Maybe Manfred sealed the veil for good.

37:42.419 --> 37:44.142
Maybe.

37:44.175 --> 37:47.644
Or maybe he closed it

37:47.670 --> 37:49.938
for a thousand years.

37:49.970 --> 37:53.295
That's a ways away.

37:53.330 --> 37:55.030
I can live with that.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.950
Want to go home?

38:14.989 --> 38:16.957
Is it rude?

38:16.990 --> 38:18.791
No.

38:18.818 --> 38:21.920
How about we go...

38:21.947 --> 38:23.914
then we come back in a little bit?

38:23.955 --> 38:27.329
So long as we come back before the cake.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.334
Again?

38:32.369 --> 38:33.785
Lucky.

38:47.691 --> 38:51.661
You know none of this would
have happened without you.

38:51.679 --> 38:54.165
Well, I wouldn't have come
back if it wasn't for you,

38:54.191 --> 38:57.393
so by extension, it's...

38:57.412 --> 38:59.528
All this is because of me?

39:02.065 --> 39:03.299
Yay me.

39:03.333 --> 39:07.169
Yay you.

39:07.204 --> 39:10.043
How about you dance with me?

39:10.066 --> 39:12.964
Dancing, uh, not my favorite thing.

39:12.996 --> 39:16.312
Yeah, but it's mine.

39:16.346 --> 39:17.596
Come on.

40:17.641 --> 40:19.241
The hell is that?

40:19.291 --> 40:21.425
You can hear that rumbling too?

40:21.444 --> 40:22.544
How can I not?

40:47.170 --> 40:49.286
Oh, gosh.

40:49.325 --> 40:51.273
Apologies.

40:51.308 --> 40:52.942
A terrible first impression.

40:52.981 --> 40:55.443
The trucks weren't supposed
to arrive for another day...

40:55.445 --> 40:56.545
Who are you?

40:56.579 --> 40:57.646
Melanie Pratt,

40:57.681 --> 40:59.315
work with Albany Worldwide.

40:59.349 --> 41:01.164
We're a hospitality company

41:01.195 --> 41:02.885
and the new owners of the hotel.

41:02.914 --> 41:04.486
Why would you buy the hotel?

41:04.521 --> 41:06.156
We're renovating.

41:06.180 --> 41:08.181
I mean, it is a historic property.

41:08.192 --> 41:09.833
I don't think that's wise.

41:09.853 --> 41:12.662
Oh, this will completely
revitalize Midnight.

41:12.696 --> 41:14.496
We'll make this town a destination.

41:14.531 --> 41:17.166
We'll get tourists
in here from all over.

41:23.267 --> 41:25.674
This town has a very colorful history.

41:25.709 --> 41:28.033
That's one way to put it.
