WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:04.713
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.796 --> 00:08.550
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.634 --> 00:12.095
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:12.179 --> 00:14.890
On which we used to rely?

00:14.973 --> 00:18.393
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.477 --> 00:21.772
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.855 --> 00:23.315
All the things
that make us

00:23.398 --> 00:24.816
Laugh and cry

00:24.900 --> 00:30.072
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:34.243 --> 00:36.119
(ringing)

00:36.203 --> 00:37.496
Hey, how'd you sleep,
Peter?

00:37.579 --> 00:39.581
Uh, Brian, last night
I had this crazy dream.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.625
I was eatin' a sheep
and now my pillow's gone.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.126
Oh, wait. Here it is.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.753
What the hell was I eatin'?

00:44.837 --> 00:46.755
(bleating)

00:49.383 --> 00:51.218
Oh, sorry.

00:52.845 --> 00:54.972
(Darth Vader theme playing)

01:06.400 --> 01:07.484
See you, Lois.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.986
Oh, and like
I tell you every day,

01:09.069 --> 01:10.946
if I come back in
the middle of the afternoon

01:11.029 --> 01:13.824
and you're having
sex with somebody, I'll kill you both.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.118
Huh, "Thanks to
effective treatments,

01:16.201 --> 01:19.830
Magic Johnson
down to one AID."

01:19.913 --> 01:21.957
Oh, God, did I hit
that deaf kid again?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.917
They ought to put
a bell on that guy.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.338
The nurse says
Brian won't be out of surgery

01:28.422 --> 01:29.715
for another three hours.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.675
Oh, I hope
he's gonna be okay.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.010
Me, too.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.095
I know we're not here
to place blame or beat ourselves up,

01:35.179 --> 01:38.515
but I can't help feelin' like
this is somehow Meg's fault.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.976
Oh, I just can't
stand the thought of losin' Brian.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.061
Oh, if he dies,
I'm gonna have to start

01:43.145 --> 01:44.521
hanging out
with The Rock again.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.981
ANNOUNCER:
One's a baby,

01:46.064 --> 01:49.651
and the other's... black,
I think.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.778
At least part black.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.864
Or Hispanic.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.700
I think, you know, possibly,
there's some Filipino in there.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.994
Yeah, possibly some Filipino.

01:59.077 --> 02:03.248
I mean, if he-- if he's black,
it's definitely diluted.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.876
I mean, one of his parents
must be white.

02:05.959 --> 02:10.047
What the hell is Jessica Alba,
for that matter?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.465
If I were 40 years younger,

02:11.548 --> 02:13.800
I would plow that
'til next July.

02:15.928 --> 02:18.931
All right, class, today as a special
treat, I'm going to show you this

02:19.014 --> 02:22.100
fascinating episode of NOVA
that I taped at home for you.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.562
You comin' back to bed,
Rob?

02:25.646 --> 02:26.855
Uh, hang on, honey.
Hang on.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.273
My jaw keeps locking up.

02:28.357 --> 02:31.235
Oh, well, that's not
NOVA at all, is it?

02:31.318 --> 02:33.445
That's a sex tape
I made with my wife.

02:33.529 --> 02:36.365
Of course, nobody here is interested
in seeing that sort of thing.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.742
Are they? Probably not.
No. Okay.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.286
Oh, you kind of looked like
you were nodding? Nope?

02:41.370 --> 02:42.913
Okay. Okay,
we should get back to work.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.499
Uh, all right, next up,
does everyone have a lab partner?

02:45.582 --> 02:46.917
-I don't.
-Me, neither.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.001
She can be my partner.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.920
Sarah,
that's very irresponsible.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.296
Meg is awful.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.257
-You want to be my lab partner?
-Really?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.800
Sure, you seem nice.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.510
Hey, do you want to join
my after-school club?

02:56.593 --> 02:57.594
Sure.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.096
Now,
open your books to page--

02:59.179 --> 03:00.305
You know what?
Look, I'm sorry.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.641
Can I just go ahead
and show this video of me doing my wife?

03:04.560 --> 03:06.770
Here we are, Brian,
safe and sound.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.605
Peter, I don't need
to be in a wheelchair.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.274
Now, now, no arguments,
Brian.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.776
I already went through the trouble
of borrowing this ramp from Joe.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.778
I'll see you, honey.
I'll be back in a--

03:14.862 --> 03:15.946
(screaming)

03:16.029 --> 03:17.573
Joe, are you all right?

03:17.656 --> 03:20.784
Don't help me up.
I need to retain my independence.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.869
(crickets chirping)

03:21.952 --> 03:24.663
-You need anything from the market?
-PowerBar!

03:27.165 --> 03:28.417
What's wrong, Brian?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.210
You've just been
sittin' on the couch

03:30.294 --> 03:32.045
ever since you got
back from the hospital.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.630
You need to get
out of the house.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.632
I don't know, Lois.
I'm a little depressed.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.302
The accident got me thinkin'
about how uncertain life is

03:38.385 --> 03:40.095
and how suddenly
it can be taken away.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.514
Oh, you're gonna feel
back to normal in no time.

03:42.598 --> 03:43.599
Here, have some food.

03:43.682 --> 03:44.892
(muffled) I'm not hungry.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.727
Here comes the gravy.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.854
(coughing)

03:50.522 --> 03:52.733
You messy beast.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.112
Well, hello there, Meg.

03:57.196 --> 04:00.032
Um, Neil, I really can't be seen
talking to you anymore.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.784
I have friends now,
and some of them, very popular.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.662
I know. I heard Sarah
is your lab partner.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.832
All those years
of you rejecting me finally made sense.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.584
What do you mean?

04:13.879 --> 04:16.465
Oh, my God!

04:20.344 --> 04:22.012
(sighing)

04:22.095 --> 04:24.014
Meg! There you are.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.600
Hey, everybody, this is our
newest member, Meg.

04:26.683 --> 04:27.684
Hi, Meg.
What's up?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.604
Hi, you gays-- guys--
girls.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.106
Ugh, look, listen, Sarah,
I can't be in your club.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.608
I'm not a lesbian.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.569
You can't be serious.
We had a whole party planned for you.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.030
Really?
A party, for me?

04:40.113 --> 04:42.950
-But I guess if you're not a lesbian...
-Wait, wait.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.536
You didn't let me finish.
I'm not a lesbian.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.955
I'm a super,
huge mega-lesbian.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.707
Oh, good. You'll fit in
with the other mega-lesbians.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.211
My heart's on fire

04:54.294 --> 04:56.004
Elvira

04:58.465 --> 04:59.633
Giddy up

04:59.716 --> 05:02.261
Ba-oom bop, ba-oom bop
ba mow mow

05:02.344 --> 05:03.387
Giddy up

05:03.470 --> 05:06.390
Ba-oom bop, ba-oom bop
ba mow mow

05:06.473 --> 05:08.767
Wow!
I feel so socially accepted.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.394
Hey, do you have
any other friends

05:10.477 --> 05:11.937
you want to invite
to your party?

05:12.020 --> 05:15.357
Uh, no.
Most of my friends... are out of town.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.067
Oh, this is gonna be great!

05:17.150 --> 05:19.111
We'll stay up late,
trade stories.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.362
(gasps)

05:20.445 --> 05:22.823
Ooh, let's watch the video
of my ballet recital.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.325
Here it is!

05:25.409 --> 05:26.743
(gasping)

05:28.537 --> 05:31.164
Sunshine Bear. Wait!

05:33.834 --> 05:35.169
(truck honking)

05:38.338 --> 05:39.339
(gasping)

05:39.423 --> 05:41.550
(music playing)

05:41.633 --> 05:43.844
Hey, how's it goin'?
Good.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.429
Oh, those are huge.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.389
Those are huge boobs.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.057
And you know what's nice?

05:49.141 --> 05:51.268
That-- That you don't
have that blue vein up there

05:51.351 --> 05:53.187
that some of
the bigger ones get.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.608
What?
I said you don't have that.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.484
Hey, buddy,
you're not looking so good.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.862
Who cares how I look?
Nothing matters.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.489
We-- We could all die tomorrow,
every one of us.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.326
Well, isn't that
a damn good reason to live it up today?

06:07.409 --> 06:09.578
Come on, it can't possibly
be that simple.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.414
Excuse me.
I've got a thing to do.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.790
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

06:13.874 --> 06:15.584
we have a very
special guest tonight.

06:15.667 --> 06:19.963
Please welcome
the Member of the Board, Frank Sinatra Jr.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.382
Love is lovelier

06:22.466 --> 06:25.552
The second time around

06:26.553 --> 06:28.388
Just as wonderful

06:28.472 --> 06:31.725
With both feet
on the ground

06:33.060 --> 06:34.811
Who can say

06:34.895 --> 06:39.316
What brought us
to this miracle we've found

06:39.399 --> 06:41.818
There are those who'd bet

06:41.902 --> 06:45.113
Love comes but once
and yet

06:45.197 --> 06:48.200
I'm oh so glad we met

06:48.283 --> 06:52.621
The second time around

06:57.417 --> 06:59.169
All this singing
is contagious.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.504
I'll sing, too.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.965
Adam West

07:03.048 --> 07:06.134
Adam West

07:06.218 --> 07:08.095
A little bit softer now.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.097
Adam West

07:10.180 --> 07:13.016
Adam West

07:13.100 --> 07:16.228
Adam West, Adam West

07:16.311 --> 07:18.981
I'll come out
when they're all gone.

07:24.236 --> 07:27.823
Wow, Brian, you actually got to sing
with Frank Sinatra Jr.?

07:27.906 --> 07:28.907
Oh, it was amazing.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.450
I-- I got to tell you,
he said some things

07:30.534 --> 07:32.411
that were exactly
what I needed to hear,

07:32.494 --> 07:34.705
and I-- I was just inspired
to get up on that stage.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.665
Got to live life for today,
you know?

07:36.748 --> 07:40.711
Uh, Brian, don't you think it's a little
too early to be hittin' the booze?

07:40.794 --> 07:41.962
Hey,
what's the point of waiting?

07:42.045 --> 07:43.922
You got to live life
while you can and live it hard.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.716
Oh, the Chris Farley method,
that's good.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.634
Frank invited me
back this evening.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.887
I tell you, I feel
more exhilarated than Peter did

07:49.970 --> 07:51.263
when he swam with the bulls.

07:51.346 --> 07:54.683
(classical music playing)

08:14.494 --> 08:15.871
(crowd applauding)

08:15.954 --> 08:18.624
Oh, yeah, that's fair.
No, that's totally a fair score.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.922
You know, Brian,
when you wear that suit,

08:25.005 --> 08:27.549
it looks like
you're taking a white poop.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.760
But it's stuck.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.303
Look, Lois asked me
to baby-sit you,

08:31.386 --> 08:32.763
so just stay here
and be quiet.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.848
I'll be back
after my first set.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.103
What the hell am I supposed
to do to kill time?

08:40.187 --> 08:42.981
Oh, maybe I'll play 52 Pickup.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.776
Ugh, this game's better
if there's someone else here.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.737
'Cause then they can say,
"Oh, I'm not gonna pick up those cards."

08:48.820 --> 08:52.074
And then-- then I say,
"You have to, it's 52 Pickup."

08:52.157 --> 08:54.993
And they say,
"Well, what if I just leave them there?"

08:55.077 --> 08:57.287
And I say,
"Those are my father's cards.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.997
"You can't just
leave them there.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.290
"He's gonna be mad."

09:00.374 --> 09:01.625
Where am I?

09:01.708 --> 09:05.295
I don't care
if the sun don't shine

09:05.379 --> 09:07.422
I do my drinking
in the evening time

09:07.506 --> 09:10.008
When I'm

09:10.092 --> 09:11.927
In Rhode Island

09:12.010 --> 09:13.011
(scatting)

09:13.136 --> 09:14.137
Get out of here.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.557
You can sit
in the sun and camp

09:16.640 --> 09:19.142
But I get my color
from a sun ray lamp

09:19.226 --> 09:21.353
When I'm

09:21.436 --> 09:23.689
In Rhode Island

09:25.065 --> 09:28.443
Whoa. Easy, kid. These people
paid good money to get in here.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.863
Oh, yeah? How much are you
charging them to get out?

09:30.946 --> 09:32.155
(rim shot)

09:32.239 --> 09:34.074
(laughing hysterically)

09:36.535 --> 09:39.037
We go together
There's no mistake

09:39.121 --> 09:41.957
Like a bowl of chowder
and a big clam cake

09:42.040 --> 09:45.002
And we love

09:45.085 --> 09:47.045
Rhode Island

09:48.213 --> 09:50.174
(crowd cheering)

09:50.257 --> 09:51.842
That was sensational.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.553
We're gonna be the biggest thing
since Edison harnessed electricity.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.266
Look at Edison over there
with his damn electricity.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.519
Hey, Edison, how about sharing
some of those light bulbs, huh?

10:02.603 --> 10:04.605
Hey, figure it out
for yourself, man.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.523
We're freezing
our asses off over here.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.650
Hey, man, how do you think
I feel, you know?

10:08.734 --> 10:10.360
You-- You get to look
at my great house.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.404
I get to look at
that dark thing, huh?

10:12.487 --> 10:14.698
What-- what is that, a candle over there?
Oh, that's pretty sweet.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.992
Yeah, it's a candl--
We-- We're freezing over here.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.662
No one in my family's
taken a bath in a month. We stink.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.206
It stinks over here,
you jerk.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.498
I can't hear you
over my central heating.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.042
Hey, why don't you
go to hell, Edison.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.210
Hey, bite me, man.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.628
Hey, you guys seen
The Office?

10:27.711 --> 10:29.588
Oh, no, I guess you haven't,
'cause you don't have a TV.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.548
Hey, how about I come
over there and kick your ass?

10:31.632 --> 10:34.092
Oooh,
yeah, come on over.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.887
( Foxy Lady playing)

10:36.970 --> 10:38.138
Foxy

10:43.477 --> 10:44.895
What is this, Lois?

10:44.978 --> 10:47.523
It's jambalaya.
It's a new recipe.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.317
(grunting)

10:50.400 --> 10:51.401
Peter.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.195
-(whining)
-Eat your food, mister.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.613
(whining)

10:54.696 --> 10:56.240
All right, if you don't want it,
put it in your napkin.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.699
-(whining)
-Peter,

10:57.783 --> 11:00.244
put it in your napkin!
Put it in your--

11:00.327 --> 11:01.995
-(whining)
-I'm not gonna--

11:02.079 --> 11:03.330
-(whining)
-Pet-- (sighs)

11:03.413 --> 11:06.375
You know, some people
would be very happy to have this food.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.168
Like John Goodman's family.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.087
Please, Daddy.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.590
I told you, when I'm finished,
you can have what's left.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.425
There won't be any left.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.678
There's never any left.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.807
(gasping)

11:21.890 --> 11:24.017
Happy Thanksgiving.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.477
(chuckling softly)

11:27.813 --> 11:29.690
Mom, why is
the cable guy here?

11:29.773 --> 11:32.442
It's me, you guys,
and I have something to tell you all.

11:32.526 --> 11:36.905
Mom. Dad. I am a lesbian.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.701
That is awesome.
Peter.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.744
Meg, you are not a lesbian.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.454
You know, I don't care
what you guys think.

11:44.538 --> 11:48.417
All my new lesbian friends accept me,
and that's all that matters.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.710
Meg, you're my daughter.

11:49.793 --> 11:50.961
I would accept you
if you were gay

11:51.044 --> 11:53.589
or blind or retarded,
but you're not.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.300
You guys don't care
about me and my struggle!

11:56.383 --> 11:57.801
I hate you!

11:57.885 --> 11:59.678
Oh, Meg, I think you're
just trying to fit in

11:59.761 --> 12:01.638
by pretending to be
something you're not.

12:01.722 --> 12:05.184
Like the time Peter pretended to be racist
to get out of jury duty.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.397
Awful lot of honkies
in here.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.112
(inaudible)

12:23.368 --> 12:24.995
(inaudible)

12:36.173 --> 12:37.424
(inaudible)

12:40.844 --> 12:42.513
(retching)

12:48.769 --> 12:49.978
Brian, there you are.

12:50.062 --> 12:52.064
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

12:52.147 --> 12:54.066
Stewie was supposed
to be in bed two hours ago.

12:54.149 --> 12:57.444
Oh, yeah, he, uh...
He's, um, he's--

12:57.528 --> 13:00.447
He was right here,
right next to me like, four hours ago.

13:00.531 --> 13:03.575
What? Brian, you were
supposed to watch him!

13:03.659 --> 13:05.494
(gasping)
Oh, my little sweetie!

13:05.577 --> 13:07.496
Hey, Brian, remember me?

13:07.579 --> 13:09.081
I'm the guy you left
standing at the counter

13:09.164 --> 13:11.834
at McDonald's with
a bag full of burgers.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.461
You know, it's funny,
I tried to walk home and, um,

13:14.545 --> 13:18.423
a lot of hungry deer walking around
at this hour of the night and, um,

13:18.507 --> 13:20.133
oh, here's where
the story gets fun.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.594
Uh, you may have noticed
I'm missing an ear.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.847
Managed to, uh, pull it
out of the deer's mouth

13:24.930 --> 13:27.057
and put it in some ice
I got at a 7-Eleven.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.893
So, when you're ready to apologize,
just talk into this cup.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.187
Ugh, Brian,
this is inexcusable.

13:32.271 --> 13:33.939
Yeah, what if somethin'
had happened to Stewie?

13:34.022 --> 13:35.941
My ear's in a cup,
I guess that doesn't count.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.235
Hey, hey,
I'm not the kid's baby-sitter, all right?

13:38.318 --> 13:39.945
I have my own life to live.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.573
You know, this is all because you've been
hangin' out with that Frank Sinatra Jr.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.616
I am gonna call
his mother Mia Farrow

13:44.700 --> 13:46.034
and give her
a piece of my mind.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.412
And you are gonna stop
singin' at that crazy club.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.705
Operator, Mia Farrow,
please.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.415
You stay out of my life!

13:51.498 --> 13:52.541
(growling)

13:52.624 --> 13:53.876
(screaming)

13:53.959 --> 13:56.003
What the hell
is happenin' to you?

13:56.086 --> 13:58.547
Yeah, uh, don't worry, I don't need to go
to the hospital or anything.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.674
I'll just use this
Mr. Potato Head piece.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.348
He bit me, Lois.
The bastard bit me.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.434
Oh, honey,
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.061
Brian's going through
some heavy stuff right now.

14:13.145 --> 14:14.479
He almost died.

14:16.982 --> 14:19.067
Listen, Peter, I--

14:19.151 --> 14:20.611
I just want to apologi--
(grunts)

14:20.694 --> 14:21.737
You know what?
Forget it.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.072
(stammering)
I don't need this. I'm out of here.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.158
(sighing)
Look what you did, Peter.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.951
I can't help it.
I haven't been this scared

14:28.035 --> 14:29.745
since I was mugged
by Gene Shalit.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.413
Don't Panic Room.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.833
I'm not going
to William Hurt you.

14:34.917 --> 14:38.045
I only want your
Tango & Cash.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.088
So just Pay It Forward

14:40.172 --> 14:43.509
and we'll
all be Happy Gilmore.

14:43.592 --> 14:44.718
What?

14:49.306 --> 14:52.059
So, how's my suddenly
lesbian daughter doin'?

14:52.142 --> 14:54.645
Great. We're checking out
naked girls.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.147
I am so into girls.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.566
Oh, come on, Meg,
you can stop the charade.

14:59.650 --> 15:02.277
My God, you're as transparent
as your father was

15:02.361 --> 15:04.947
when he pretended to be
a Hasidic Jew to get off work.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.074
Good morning,
Hebrews and shebrews.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.326
What a glorious Jewish day.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.454
Hey, how about all those coupons
in the Sunday paper, huh?

15:12.538 --> 15:14.081
Some good deals there.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.958
Hey, you know,
I went into a store last week

15:16.041 --> 15:17.876
and they wanted $800
for a TV,

15:17.960 --> 15:20.671
but I us'ed
them down to $500.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.089
(screaming)

15:22.422 --> 15:25.259
It's not a charade, Mom.
I am a lesbian.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.302
What do I have to do
to prove this to you?

15:27.386 --> 15:29.680
Well, maybe if I'd seen you
kiss your girlfriend.

15:29.763 --> 15:30.806
Fine.

15:30.889 --> 15:31.932
What was that?

15:32.015 --> 15:33.308
What is she,
your grandmother?

15:33.392 --> 15:36.228
(scoffs)
That's no kiss. Watch this.

15:37.396 --> 15:39.690
(moaning)

15:43.819 --> 15:45.946
Look, I can't tell you
how to lead your life.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.489
If you don't want
to face the truth,

15:47.573 --> 15:49.241
there's nothin'
I can do about it.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.369
Chris, I'm all out
of digital audio tape.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.662
Oh, he's gone.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.164
Oh, hey, can I get you guys
to sign these release forms?

15:58.208 --> 16:00.294
Oh, where the hell is Brian?

16:00.377 --> 16:01.795
I don't know,
but I better go find him.

16:01.879 --> 16:04.423
We can't sit here watching
infomercials all night.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.675
Hello.
How come I rich and you not?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.802
How come you not sell
real estate like I do?

16:08.886 --> 16:10.929
How come I sleep with
your wife while you at work,

16:11.013 --> 16:13.432
and then I pee in your toilet
and don't flush?

16:13.515 --> 16:14.850
And sometimes
I open the back part

16:14.933 --> 16:17.436
and I pee in there,
so that when you flush pee come out.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.854
You know why?
Because I'm smart.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.231
I'm smart, you stupid.
Call now.

16:21.315 --> 16:25.277
Brian! Brian!

16:25.360 --> 16:29.114
Brian! Bria--

16:30.532 --> 16:31.783
Ugh, who am I kidding?

16:31.867 --> 16:33.660
All those buttons,
I'll look like Steve Harvey.

16:33.744 --> 16:34.786
Brian!

16:37.706 --> 16:40.459
Yeah, I'll ask the cashier
if I can put this up in the window.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.836
I definitely need
a breath freshener.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.297
Ooh, but that's going
to give me 11 items.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.424
-That's fine.
-No, no, no.

16:47.508 --> 16:49.510
Rules is rules.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.428
Let's see what
I'm gonna put back.

16:51.512 --> 16:54.973
Okay, I need the Reynolds Wrap
and the bathroom tissue.

16:55.057 --> 16:58.769
I could do without the Triscuits,
but they sure are good.

16:58.852 --> 16:59.978
(sighs)

17:00.062 --> 17:02.314
7-Up's the whole reason
I came down here in the first place.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.649
You know what?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.484
I'm not gonna need the V8,

17:05.567 --> 17:07.319
'cause I can just
get some tomato juice

17:07.402 --> 17:09.321
at the mini-mart
down the street.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.365
It's a little more expensive,
but that's okay.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.534
I like to help out
a small business.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.827
I hope it's okay
if I pay you in pennies.

17:20.249 --> 17:22.334
Oh, God, a gutter?
How cliche.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.127
I don't know what went wrong.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.839
I was just trying to
live for the moment, you know?

17:26.922 --> 17:29.383
Because life can end
so abruptly

17:29.466 --> 17:31.552
and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.555
Is that why you've been on
this path to self-destruction?

17:34.638 --> 17:36.431
You know, Brian,
as smart as you are,

17:36.515 --> 17:37.933
you've got
to accept the fact that

17:38.016 --> 17:40.894
there are some things in life
that you just can't control.

17:40.978 --> 17:44.565
You mean the way-- the way you can't
control that messed up way

17:44.648 --> 17:45.649
that you laugh
when-- when you think

17:45.732 --> 17:47.651
something's
really, really funny?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.695
WOMAN (on TV): Well, Hope,
I don't understand why

17:49.778 --> 17:51.530
these cookies are
giving us all the fits.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.532
HOPE: Well, no wonder, Faith.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.367
That's not baking powder.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.202
It's sneezing powder.

17:57.286 --> 17:59.037
(laughing ridiculously)

18:01.999 --> 18:05.878
But, I already brought a whole batch
to the church bake sale.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.087
(laughing ridiculously)

18:09.173 --> 18:12.342
No wonder that priest
kept saying, "Bless you."

18:12.426 --> 18:14.052
(laughing ridiculously)

18:18.265 --> 18:19.349
Yes, and I accept that.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.268
Your problem is,
you think that

18:21.351 --> 18:22.811
just because
you're not in control,

18:22.895 --> 18:25.272
nothing matters.
That-- That you don't matter.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.857
But you know what?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.150
You matter to someone.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.943
(hoarse voice)
You matter big time.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.615
Hey, Meg.
What are you doing here?

18:34.698 --> 18:37.618
Listen, Sarah,
I got to get something off my chest.

18:37.701 --> 18:38.827
Yes!

18:38.911 --> 18:40.162
I need to open up.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.246
Sweet.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.290
So get ready
'cause here it is.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.833
My mom was right.

18:45.959 --> 18:46.960
What do you mean?

18:47.044 --> 18:48.253
I'm not gay.

18:48.337 --> 18:49.755
What?

18:49.838 --> 18:52.508
So, all those rounds of golf we played,
those were all lies?

18:52.591 --> 18:53.759
I'm so sorry.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.678
For the first time in my life,
I felt like I belonged,

18:56.762 --> 18:58.472
and I wanted it to be true.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.807
So I pretended
to be something I'm not.

19:00.891 --> 19:03.268
You're going to choose
to be heterosexual?

19:03.352 --> 19:04.853
I thought being gay
wasn't a choice.

19:04.937 --> 19:05.938
Well, not for guys.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.940
It was wrong of me
to mislead you.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.149
I should go.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.276
That was awful.
That was just awful.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.778
What do you think, Mark?

19:12.861 --> 19:15.197
I don't know, man.
We didn't get the shots we need.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.865
Man, what do you think, Mike?

19:16.949 --> 19:19.076
I mean, if you saw action
goin' on in front of you,

19:19.159 --> 19:21.495
would you know instinctively
to center it in front of you?

19:21.578 --> 19:23.038
I don't know.
Could someone take

19:23.121 --> 19:24.456
my soda out of
the icebox please,

19:24.540 --> 19:25.958
so it doesn't freeze?

19:26.041 --> 19:29.127
(orchestra playing)

19:29.211 --> 19:30.963
(applause)

19:32.422 --> 19:35.467
How I love a girl
who's flawless

19:35.551 --> 19:38.095
Even better
when she's braless

19:38.178 --> 19:42.474
But the thing
that tops it all is when we swing

19:44.935 --> 19:47.813
And how I love
a glass of Jack

19:47.896 --> 19:50.566
Or anything
with Robert Stack

19:50.649 --> 19:52.818
But the gals we romance

19:52.901 --> 19:54.278
Can't stay
out of our pants

19:54.361 --> 19:55.988
When we swing

19:57.447 --> 20:01.577
Yesterday had got me
feeling kind of blue

20:03.787 --> 20:08.000
So you left and
we replaced you with a Jew

20:08.083 --> 20:09.293
-Lady!
-You're fired.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.502
Oy!

20:10.586 --> 20:13.630
We love it
when the ladies squeeze us

20:13.714 --> 20:16.550
That's an easy way
to please us

20:16.633 --> 20:19.344
But we feel like
freaking Jesus

20:19.428 --> 20:21.763
When we swing

20:22.931 --> 20:25.851
I love
the work of Allen Funt

20:26.768 --> 20:29.563
Or a nicely shaven leg

20:29.646 --> 20:34.484
But nothing compares
to the feeling that we get

20:35.694 --> 20:39.031
No, nothing compares
to the feeling we get

20:39.114 --> 20:42.951
When we swing

20:43.035 --> 20:45.037
(all cheering)

20:47.164 --> 20:49.041
Frank, there you are.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.334
Mia Farrow?

20:50.417 --> 20:53.212
What's this I hear about you up all night
with a baby and a dog?

20:53.295 --> 20:55.047
Oh, leave me alone.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.340
Get over here, young man.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.008
Oh, damn it all.

21:03.138 --> 21:06.058
-FRANK JR.: It seems today
-that all you see

21:06.141 --> 21:09.603
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

21:09.686 --> 21:13.190
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

21:13.273 --> 21:15.901
On which we used to rely?

21:15.984 --> 21:19.238
Lucky there's a family guy

21:19.321 --> 21:22.407
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

21:22.491 --> 21:24.368
All the things
that make us

21:24.451 --> 21:25.702
Laugh and cry

21:25.786 --> 21:31.166
He's a family guy
