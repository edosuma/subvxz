<i>Nine years ago, I witnessed</i>
<i>my mother's murder.</i>

00:03.642 --> 00:05.175
<i>I would have been killed too,</i>

00:05.177 --> 00:07.010
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

00:09.513 --> 00:10.680
You're him.

00:10.682 --> 00:11.815
VINCENT:
<i>I was part of an experimental</i>

00:11.817 --> 00:13.483
<i>special forces group.</i>

00:13.485 --> 00:16.569
<i>Their goal was to create</i>
<i>the perfect super soldier.</i>

00:17.988 --> 00:19.055
<i>I blacked out again.</i>

00:19.057 --> 00:20.440
<i>The blackouts</i>

00:20.442 --> 00:21.658
are a random side effect

00:21.660 --> 00:23.409
of the experiments,
but they might stop

00:23.411 --> 00:25.028
if we have a serum.

00:25.030 --> 00:26.062
I need you to do this.

00:26.064 --> 00:27.363
You need to make
that serum fast.

00:27.365 --> 00:29.365
TESS:
<i>Leaving early</i>

00:29.367 --> 00:31.284
<i>'cause of your new intern?</i>
What intern?

00:31.286 --> 00:32.902
<i>The dude who was</i>
<i>in your lab today.</i>

00:34.338 --> 00:35.872

<i>I am not gonna spend my life</i>

00:35.874 --> 00:38.424
<i>in a cage.</i>

00:38.426 --> 00:40.426
We don't have to stay away
from each other anymore.

00:40.428 --> 00:41.528
The serum worked.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.296
Yeah.

00:45.833 --> 00:49.385
♪ Sneakers on the blacktop

00:49.387 --> 00:50.804
You know,

00:50.806 --> 00:52.806
for bridesmaids dresses,
these aren't that bad.

00:52.808 --> 00:54.974
Wow, okay, who are
you right now?

00:54.976 --> 00:56.893
You wouldn't even fill out
the RSVP card

00:56.895 --> 00:58.394
and now you're gushing
over dresses;

00:58.396 --> 00:59.729
you are hosting
the brunch tomorrow.

00:59.731 --> 01:02.699
Our father is getting married
in two days.

01:02.701 --> 01:04.818
I am excited.
I am, too.

01:04.819 --> 01:06.675
And if you want, you can totally
hang out with me and Josh.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.938
Heather, I am fine

01:07.939 --> 01:10.106
that I don't have a date.
Dad has found happiness

01:10.108 --> 01:11.741
after everything
he's been through.

01:11.743 --> 01:14.077
We have to make sure
that everyone has a good time.

01:14.079 --> 01:16.129
We are the daughters
of the groom.

01:16.131 --> 01:17.497
Yeah.
We are

01:17.499 --> 01:18.414
bridesmaided up!

01:18.416 --> 01:19.716
Yes!

01:21.001 --> 01:23.303
VINCENT:
"Bridesmaided up"?

01:24.421 --> 01:25.955
Shh!

01:25.957 --> 01:28.091
(quietly):
Is that even a verb?

01:28.093 --> 01:29.642
You are clearly
still feeling better

01:29.644 --> 01:31.678
if you are calling me
on my grammar.

01:31.680 --> 01:35.098
Yeah, well, I haven't blacked
out since I got the serum.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.683
Now I'm relieved.

01:36.685 --> 01:39.853
I'm so relieved I feel
as festive as you look.

01:39.855 --> 01:40.820
Yes,

01:40.822 --> 01:42.655
yes, I am trying.

01:42.657 --> 01:44.524
Not that I'm not happy, but...

01:44.526 --> 01:46.075
you know how weddings are.

01:46.077 --> 01:48.194
And now I show up,

01:48.196 --> 01:50.813
almost 30, by myself?

01:50.815 --> 01:53.649
So, uh, you're...

01:54.151 --> 01:55.919
...overcompensating?

01:55.921 --> 01:57.170
Totally.

01:58.488 --> 01:59.839
Yeah, I don't know.

01:59.841 --> 02:02.425
I guess I've been so
caught up with my mom

02:02.427 --> 02:04.510
that I haven't always
been there for my dad.

02:04.512 --> 02:06.679
Vincent, I just...
I want this to be

02:06.681 --> 02:09.181
amazing for everyone.

02:09.184 --> 02:11.000
(sighs)

02:11.002 --> 02:13.336
I wish you could go with me.

02:14.772 --> 02:16.672
(chuckles)

02:18.008 --> 02:21.477
Yeah, I mean, there might
be a few obstacles with that.

02:21.479 --> 02:23.730
Oh, you mean the whole...

02:23.732 --> 02:26.816
Yeah, they run out of pigs in
a blanket, and I just kind of...

02:26.818 --> 02:28.785
(laughs)
Yeah.

02:28.787 --> 02:30.787
And it would be
kind of difficult

02:30.789 --> 02:33.539
to explain the
whole... dead thing.

02:33.541 --> 02:35.491
Mm-hmm.
Although...

02:35.493 --> 02:37.877
you could go as
Vincent Zalanski.

02:37.879 --> 02:39.996
"Zalanski"?
Yes.

02:39.998 --> 02:41.798
I had this huge crush on him
in kindergarten.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.417
Okay. Where's
this Zalanski from?

02:44.419 --> 02:46.702
Somewhere that I have
no relatives.

02:46.704 --> 02:48.004
Denver?

02:48.006 --> 02:50.924
Denver. So...
I'd probably be a skier.

02:50.926 --> 02:53.893
When you aren't busy
saving lives in the E.R.

02:53.895 --> 02:56.312
I like the sound of my Denver life.
(chuckles)

03:00.517 --> 03:02.769
Uh, well, I-I came here
'cause, um,

03:02.771 --> 03:04.887
I have another case for you.

03:04.889 --> 03:06.940
Ah.

03:06.942 --> 03:09.692
It is always work, work,
work with you, Zalanski.

03:09.694 --> 03:12.228
Yeah, well, look,
I was out walking,

03:12.230 --> 03:15.231
and, uh, I saw this guy heading
into his brownstone

03:15.233 --> 03:17.200
but he reeked of blood.

03:17.202 --> 03:19.068
Was he injured?
No, he didn't

03:19.070 --> 03:20.586
seem to be, but the smell,

03:20.588 --> 03:22.822
it was coming
from his briefcase as well.

03:22.824 --> 03:24.791
And the thing is
he was...

03:24.793 --> 03:26.459
nervous, you know?
He was

03:26.461 --> 03:28.177
having trouble putting
his keys in the door.

03:28.179 --> 03:30.013
His heart was racing.

03:30.015 --> 03:31.597
HEATHER:
Cat?

03:31.599 --> 03:32.799
I've got the
perfect shoes!

03:32.801 --> 03:34.050
Uh, great! Yes!
I'm just gonna

03:34.052 --> 03:35.251
bring out the
party favors!

03:35.253 --> 03:36.302
Hey, um,

03:36.304 --> 03:37.920
here's his address,

03:37.922 --> 03:39.439
for what it's worth.

03:41.608 --> 03:44.911
It was great seeing
you, Dr. Zalanski.

03:44.913 --> 03:47.113
Go bridesmaid it up.

03:47.115 --> 03:48.314
Okay.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.868
Bye.
Bye.

03:54.154 --> 03:56.706
So, someone saw a guy
coming home with blood on him?

03:56.708 --> 03:57.991
How much blood?

03:57.993 --> 03:59.876
Caller didn't say,
but it seemed legit.

03:59.878 --> 04:00.877
They gave me an address though.

04:00.879 --> 04:02.211
Hey, where do
you want these?

04:02.213 --> 04:03.880
Uh, over there
by the quiche.

04:03.882 --> 04:05.581
I can't believe
you're hosting this thing.

04:05.583 --> 04:06.883
Uh, just do a reverse

04:06.885 --> 04:08.334
look-up, see who lives there,
the address

04:08.336 --> 04:10.219
is 621 23rd Street.

04:10.221 --> 04:12.221
I got to go. I'm gonna go
sprinkle some confetti.

04:12.223 --> 04:13.806
I'm eloping.
EVAN: You busy?

04:13.808 --> 04:14.780
Sort of.

04:14.805 --> 04:16.310
Okay, I need you
to I.D. that guy

04:16.310 --> 04:18.644
that you saw posing as
my intern in the lab.

04:18.646 --> 04:20.862
I.D. him? I barely saw him.

04:20.887 --> 04:22.099
Well, that's more
than anyone else.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.966
So, we don't have security
cameras down there,

04:23.968 --> 04:26.635
but I pulled the footage
from the rest of the precinct

04:26.637 --> 04:28.604
for that day.

04:28.606 --> 04:30.306
You want me
to look at

04:30.308 --> 04:32.025
an entire day's
worth of footage?

04:32.027 --> 04:34.027
Tess, I found
a broken test tube.

04:34.029 --> 04:36.195
He was obviously
using my DNA analyzer.

04:36.197 --> 04:38.314
Is that a chargeable offense?

04:38.316 --> 04:40.083
Look, I haven't

04:40.085 --> 04:42.285
talked to anybody about this,
and you can't tell anyone,

04:42.287 --> 04:44.287
but I've been working
on a personal project

04:44.289 --> 04:46.706
on genetic mutations
and it's big.

04:46.708 --> 04:49.325
Publishable big.
Well, how does that relate to...

04:49.327 --> 04:50.993
I think he was trying
to steal it.

04:50.995 --> 04:52.962
Or sabotage it.
I don't know.

04:54.098 --> 04:55.882
The timing's too coincidental.

04:55.884 --> 04:57.100
All right, I'll tell you what.

04:57.102 --> 04:58.834
You get one of those
big research grants,

04:58.836 --> 05:00.103
give me a finder's fee.

05:00.105 --> 05:01.670
Done.

05:01.672 --> 05:03.639
You guys, this
is so sweet.

05:03.641 --> 05:06.059
And to take the
morning off of work...

05:06.061 --> 05:08.027
Of course. This way, we can
go through all the details.

05:08.029 --> 05:09.979
Which reminds me: shoes.

05:09.981 --> 05:11.042
Oh!

05:11.067 --> 05:13.501
Yes! Heather, she tried on
this great silver pair.

05:13.851 --> 05:16.352
Silver is kind of hard to match.

05:16.354 --> 05:17.870
Can we do nude?

05:17.872 --> 05:19.238
Check out my new
Louboutins.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.856
(women cooing)

05:20.858 --> 05:22.375
Ah! I have the same ones.

05:22.377 --> 05:24.360
I'm just afraid of scuffing them
on the dance floor.

05:24.362 --> 05:25.962
Oh, just seal them
with nail polish.

05:25.964 --> 05:27.330
I do it to all of my shoes.

05:27.332 --> 05:28.831
But you know what,
Brooke, you're the bride,

05:28.833 --> 05:30.299
what do you think?

05:30.301 --> 05:32.335
If you guys
don't mind...

05:32.337 --> 05:34.703
Oh, no, no, nude is great.

05:34.705 --> 05:36.339
Yeah, we can all buy
the same shoe,

05:36.341 --> 05:38.874
and then we can be matching
from head to sole.

05:38.876 --> 05:39.842
(women giggling)

05:39.844 --> 05:41.677
Aw.
Brooke,

05:41.679 --> 05:43.463
your future stepdaughters
are adorable.

05:43.465 --> 05:45.348
Meanwhile,

05:45.350 --> 05:46.715
Catherine, how is it

05:46.717 --> 05:47.850
you don't have, like, 18 guys

05:47.852 --> 05:49.018
to take to this wedding?

05:51.888 --> 05:54.440
(phone ringing)
That's work.

05:55.609 --> 05:57.243
What's wrong with you? I told
you not to talk about that.

05:57.245 --> 05:59.112
Hey.

05:59.114 --> 06:01.747
Okay, so the building's owned
by Drake and Sabrina Meyer.

06:01.749 --> 06:03.249
You got to go online.

06:03.251 --> 06:06.119
Sabrina's this crazy matchmaker
for millionaires.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.838
Who's the husband?

06:08.840 --> 06:10.906
Some finance guy. Apparently
that's her specialty,

06:10.908 --> 06:12.942
which is why he's the poster boy
for the business.

06:12.944 --> 06:14.193
You know, follow
her dating advice,

06:14.195 --> 06:15.911
you get a guy just like Drake:

06:15.913 --> 06:17.346
ultra-educated,
ultra-successful,

06:17.348 --> 06:18.347
ultra-boring.

06:18.349 --> 06:19.382
And if our tip is right,

06:19.384 --> 06:20.399
in ultra-trouble.

06:20.401 --> 06:21.551
See if you can find a victim.

06:21.553 --> 06:22.969
I'm here at bridal headquarters,

06:22.971 --> 06:24.971
making very important decisions
about shoes.

06:24.973 --> 06:27.356
I'll see you soon.
All right.

06:29.226 --> 06:31.427
CATHERINE:
So, what'd I miss?

06:31.429 --> 06:34.030
Are you using Sabrina Meyer?

06:35.098 --> 06:36.866
Who's Sabrina Meyer?
She's the famous

06:36.868 --> 06:38.117
matchmaker.

06:38.119 --> 06:39.869
You're using a matchmaker?
No,

06:39.871 --> 06:42.321
I don't need a matchmaker.
But

06:42.323 --> 06:43.973
if you don't have somebody
to take to this wedding...

06:44.073 --> 06:45.415
And Brooke knows
all the cutest guys.

06:45.443 --> 06:47.076
At least, let me sit you

06:47.078 --> 06:48.161
at the singles table.

06:48.163 --> 06:49.962
I am happy to sit
with Heather.

06:49.964 --> 06:51.831
Heather is going
with her boyfriend.

06:51.833 --> 06:54.050
So you're going
to be sitting alone,

06:54.052 --> 06:56.302
directing the cater waiter on
who's having chicken or steak.

06:56.304 --> 06:58.120
And weddings can be torture
by yourself.

06:58.122 --> 06:59.472
That's it. I'm changing
your table.

06:59.474 --> 07:02.058
No, I have someone in my life.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.342
You do?

07:04.294 --> 07:05.845
Who is he?

07:05.847 --> 07:07.063
What does he do?

07:07.065 --> 07:09.798
He is... a doctor.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.601
Wait, you're
dating a doctor?

07:11.603 --> 07:13.102
And why aren't
you bringing him

07:13.104 --> 07:14.187
to the wedding?
It-it is...

07:14.189 --> 07:15.855
it is too early
in the relationship

07:15.857 --> 07:17.740
for me to bring him
to a wedding.

07:17.742 --> 07:19.275
Oh, please, it's just
a big party.

07:19.277 --> 07:20.743
Yeah, it's not like
I'm in love with Josh.

07:20.745 --> 07:22.078
BROOKE: I am gonna get him
a place setting.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.446
What is his name?
No,

07:23.448 --> 07:25.915
Brooke, really, you don't have to.
Look,

07:25.917 --> 07:27.783
your dad's been really nervous

07:27.785 --> 07:29.502
about how you're handling
this whole wedding thing.

07:29.504 --> 07:31.170
I think it'd be really nice

07:31.172 --> 07:33.289
for him to see you
there with someone.

07:33.291 --> 07:35.124
Tell her his name.
Yeah, come on, Cat.

07:35.126 --> 07:36.292
Bridesmaid up.

07:39.846 --> 07:42.348

Hey, I'm working a tip
on a potential perp,

07:54.853 --> 07:56.153
but we don't have a victim.

07:56.155 --> 07:57.771
Has anything come
through your precinct,

07:57.773 --> 08:01.274
you know, stabbings,
gunshots?

08:01.276 --> 08:03.276
Okay, let me know
if anything changes.

You burn the quiche?

08:05.814 --> 08:07.864
I told them I have a boyfriend.

08:07.866 --> 08:09.666
Okay...

08:09.668 --> 08:13.537
And now that boyfriend is
supposed to come to the wedding.

08:14.422 --> 08:16.173
Tess, I know

08:16.175 --> 08:18.208
it was the way
that they were looking at me.

08:18.210 --> 08:20.627
It was like
we look at families

08:20.629 --> 08:22.829
who've lost their loved ones.
Like they felt sorry for me.

08:22.831 --> 08:24.264
Or there was something
wrong with me

08:24.266 --> 08:25.999
because I don't have
someone to take.

08:26.001 --> 08:29.119
Listen, this is why I don't go
to weddings alone.

08:29.121 --> 08:30.804
For one of my brother's
weddings, I was so hard up

08:30.806 --> 08:32.472
I took Joe.

08:33.307 --> 08:36.376
Joe, like-like our boss Joe?

08:37.645 --> 08:39.312
Well, his wife was
on a business trip so...

08:39.313 --> 08:41.231
Oh, my God,
how did I not know this?

08:41.232 --> 08:42.649
Does she know this?

08:42.650 --> 08:44.868
Yeah, I'm sure Joe told her,
and it was

08:44.870 --> 08:47.020
before you and I
were partners. Whatever.

08:47.022 --> 08:48.205
(phone rings)
Listen, take Evan, okay?

08:48.207 --> 08:49.847
You took him
to the engagement party.

08:50.908 --> 08:52.909
(sighs)
It's Heather.

08:52.911 --> 08:55.745
She probably wants to know more
about my fake boyfriend.

08:55.747 --> 08:57.747
Who she knows
isn't Evan because

08:57.749 --> 09:00.300
I gave fake boyfriend a name.

09:00.302 --> 09:03.036
Okay, so just tell everybody
he's busy.

09:03.038 --> 09:04.137
They'll be so distracted
by Evan's accent,

09:04.139 --> 09:05.755
they won't ask questions.

09:05.757 --> 09:07.724
Besides, that guy's got
to get out of the morgue.

09:07.726 --> 09:12.395
Tess, who's Neil Mendel
from Chadmore Capital?

09:12.397 --> 09:14.296
You can't take him 'cause
he's unofficially missing.

09:14.396 --> 09:17.846
And he's a finance guy, like
our potential perp. What's his story?

09:18.070 --> 09:20.320
All right, well, he, uh...
he missed an important meeting

09:20.322 --> 09:22.222
this morning, so his lawyer
phoned it in.

09:22.224 --> 09:23.890
It's only been a few hours
but, you know,

09:23.892 --> 09:25.942
it fit the timeline,
so I put him on the list.

09:25.944 --> 09:27.777
Okay, I know this is
a total stretch,

09:27.779 --> 09:29.329
but what else do we have to do?

09:29.331 --> 09:31.064
Well, besides find you a date?

09:31.999 --> 09:33.366
Whoa. You're right. Let's go.

09:33.368 --> 09:36.286
CATHERINE:
<i>So, preliminary reports</i>

09:36.288 --> 09:38.755
say that Neil Mendel
is single, 33.

09:38.757 --> 09:42.075
33? We're so in the
wrong line of work.

09:45.746 --> 09:49.015
Well, maybe this holds
the secrets to his success.

09:51.185 --> 09:53.303
CATHERINE:
So much for him

09:53.305 --> 09:54.855
being single.
Mm.

09:54.857 --> 09:56.256
There goes a wedding
date option.

10:00.862 --> 10:03.063
Tess.

10:03.931 --> 10:06.483
TESS:
Blood?

10:06.485 --> 10:08.735
(clanging sound)

10:08.737 --> 10:10.937
Mr. Mendel?

10:12.206 --> 10:14.291
(clanging continues)

10:16.000 --> 10:22.074

10:25.452 --> 10:27.387
VINCENT:
<i>Hit me.</i>

10:27.389 --> 10:28.421
Here, take the stun gun

10:28.423 --> 10:30.924
just in case.
You hit me,

10:30.926 --> 10:33.393
nothing happens, then maybe
I can go out and...

10:33.395 --> 10:34.427
Oh, my God,

10:34.429 --> 10:36.396
you think you're cured?

10:36.398 --> 10:39.516
Because your DNA is what it is.

10:39.518 --> 10:42.769
I know, I know, but maybe...

10:42.771 --> 10:44.654
maybe I have more control now.

10:46.157 --> 10:47.440
Catherine's dad's wedding
is this weekend.

10:47.442 --> 10:49.192
She wants me to go.

10:49.194 --> 10:51.995
Clearly your new lease on life
has landed you in lala land.

10:51.997 --> 10:55.648
Maybe, but we won't
know until you try.

10:57.201 --> 11:00.921
I'm the reason
you don't have a girlfriend.

11:00.923 --> 11:02.289
I have a girlfriend.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.507
Or at least,
I'm on my way to having one.

11:04.509 --> 11:07.127
Yeah, actually, I saw
her picture online. She is hot.

11:07.129 --> 11:09.796
You know, maybe I'll
sleep with her, too.

11:09.798 --> 11:11.047
Too?

11:11.049 --> 11:12.849
Your prom date, Jill McManahan?

11:12.851 --> 11:15.352
She was spectacular.

11:15.354 --> 11:17.470
Nice try.

11:17.472 --> 11:19.472
Come on, man. JT!

11:19.474 --> 11:21.808
Come on. Okay,
you know what? Thanks!

11:21.810 --> 11:23.860
Because now I'm more pissed
than if you'd actually hit me.

11:23.862 --> 11:25.478
And...
(door closes)

11:25.480 --> 11:27.364
Look. Nothing. I'm fine.

11:27.366 --> 11:29.232
I'm okay.

11:29.234 --> 11:33.036
I know it's a dumb test,
but I passed!

11:34.205 --> 11:36.356
I passed!

11:40.911 --> 11:42.212
Okay, this guy, Drake Meyer--

11:42.214 --> 11:44.197
what is his beef
with Neil Mendel?

11:44.199 --> 11:46.299
We don't know that yet,
but we do know

11:46.301 --> 11:47.968
the vic had a date
last night.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.469
Unmade bed, condoms,
wine glasses.

11:49.471 --> 11:52.038
Any prints? DNA?
The apartment's been wiped down.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.473
I couldn't even get
partials of the glasses.

11:53.475 --> 11:55.208
Did you see the blood
on the floor?

11:55.210 --> 11:57.377
Actually, it's some kind
of contaminant.

11:57.379 --> 11:59.212
But lucky for us,
Mendel's financials show

11:59.214 --> 12:01.181
monthly payments
to Finest Matchmaking.

12:01.183 --> 12:04.234
And guess who's married to the
owner of Finest? Drake Meyer.

12:04.236 --> 12:06.319
Chandler, you may have some
anonymous tip on this Meyer guy,

12:06.321 --> 12:08.321
but if I were you,
I'd start by finding your date.

12:08.323 --> 12:11.524
Okay, he is talking
about the case, right?

12:11.526 --> 12:13.326
Yes.
Okay.

12:13.328 --> 12:15.362
Tess, have you had
a chance to...?

12:15.364 --> 12:16.946
Could I talk to you
for a second?

12:16.948 --> 12:19.416
About the wedding?
I said yes.

12:19.418 --> 12:22.235
Really? But did Tess...?

12:22.237 --> 12:25.005
Tess? No. Heather.
Heather?

12:25.007 --> 12:27.240
She was trying to call you.

12:27.242 --> 12:28.958
She asked me to go
to the wedding.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.078
Uh, Heather has a boyfriend.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.463
<i>Had</i> a boyfriend.

12:33.465 --> 12:35.098
Apparently, her and Josh
just broke up.

12:35.100 --> 12:39.102
I thought she was calling me
about something else.

12:39.104 --> 12:41.054
Were you going to ask me to...?
It's okay.

12:41.056 --> 12:43.440
It's fine. Just save me a dance.

12:46.644 --> 12:48.228
Your sister?

12:48.230 --> 12:49.446
It's my own fault.

12:49.448 --> 12:51.948
I told her
I had a boyfriend.

12:51.950 --> 12:54.100
Hey, you know
what I'm thinking?

12:54.102 --> 12:56.269
You should go talk to
our matchmaker alone.

12:56.271 --> 12:58.038
So you want me
to interview a suspect's wife

12:58.040 --> 12:59.789
just so I can get a date?

12:59.791 --> 13:02.375
Well, not just <i>so</i> you can get
a date, but as an added perk.

13:02.377 --> 13:05.078
Listen, if we go in there with
our badges out, she'll clam up.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.629
But if you go in with
your wedding angst,

13:06.631 --> 13:08.615
you know, she might offer
some intel on the hubby.

13:08.617 --> 13:11.617
Besides, I've got a day's
worth of security footage

13:11.619 --> 13:13.286
to go through.

13:13.288 --> 13:14.637
Don't ask.

13:16.307 --> 13:17.623
Are you promiscuous?

13:17.625 --> 13:19.392
I don't have time
to be promiscuous.

13:19.394 --> 13:20.977
(laughs)
You're funny.

13:20.979 --> 13:23.680
Don't be too funny.
Men don't like that.

13:23.682 --> 13:25.598
The reason that I asked is,

13:25.600 --> 13:27.633
there's no sex on the
first three dates.

13:27.635 --> 13:30.153
You break the rules,
you're out, no refunds.

13:30.155 --> 13:31.855
Men don't like whores.

13:31.857 --> 13:34.524
And I need you to
fill out a profile.

13:34.526 --> 13:38.644
No padding your resume
or your bra size.

13:38.646 --> 13:41.147
And then I can get a guy
as great as your husband?

13:41.149 --> 13:43.149
I saw on your Web site.

13:43.151 --> 13:44.417
He's a finance guy?

13:44.419 --> 13:46.619
Real estate.
Luxury resorts.

13:46.621 --> 13:48.538
Ah. Wow.

13:48.540 --> 13:50.990
This thing is crazy detailed.

13:50.992 --> 13:54.210
Do you have to get all
your clients to fill this out?

13:54.212 --> 13:56.012
Mm, it's mandatory.

13:56.014 --> 14:00.717
Do you think I could get a
sneak peek at my options first?

14:00.719 --> 14:02.268
I'm sorry.

14:02.270 --> 14:04.604
We guarantee
our clients' privacy.

14:04.606 --> 14:07.340
Ah. Well, that's good.

14:07.342 --> 14:10.193
Oh, my God! Your shoes.

14:10.195 --> 14:12.645
I was literally just
drooling over a pair

14:12.647 --> 14:14.781
of nudes this morning. (laughs)

14:17.451 --> 14:23.289
You know, truth is, uh, I've got
my dad's wedding in two days.

14:23.291 --> 14:24.624
You know, I'm not
expecting you

14:24.626 --> 14:26.459
to work any miracles,
but it's just

14:26.461 --> 14:28.194
hard.

14:28.196 --> 14:30.663
You know, I, uh, saw the other
bridesmaids this morning,

14:30.665 --> 14:33.583
and not only do I not
have the guy,

14:33.585 --> 14:37.086
I don't even
have the shoes.

14:37.088 --> 14:38.471
But being here with you-- it...

14:38.473 --> 14:41.257
It just... it gives me
so much hope.

14:41.259 --> 14:43.726
That is why I do this job.

14:43.728 --> 14:46.513
Come on. Let me show you hope.

14:55.072 --> 14:57.574
(computer chirps)

14:59.226 --> 15:01.661
Sabrina, Neil Mendel's a client?

15:01.663 --> 15:04.564
You're his type. Uh...

15:04.566 --> 15:06.583
But he is not available.

15:06.585 --> 15:11.087
No, um, he was found dead in
his apartment this morning.

15:11.089 --> 15:13.072
What?!

15:13.074 --> 15:14.407
Yeah, I heard it
on the news.

15:14.409 --> 15:16.793
They think he might
have been murdered.

15:16.795 --> 15:19.012
Drake, Neil Mendel

15:19.014 --> 15:20.597
was murdered
this morning.

15:20.599 --> 15:22.098
Oh, my God.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.267
Um, Catherine,
this is my husband Drake.

15:24.269 --> 15:25.552
Hi.

15:25.554 --> 15:27.086
He was with Britney McCabe
last night.

15:27.088 --> 15:28.638
Who's Britney?

15:28.640 --> 15:31.391
Somebody
that we set him up with.

15:31.393 --> 15:33.092
She called here really upset.

15:33.094 --> 15:35.195
Do you think something happened
on the date?

15:35.197 --> 15:37.697
No. Oh, no, no way.

15:37.699 --> 15:39.365
I want to reassure you

15:39.367 --> 15:41.568
that we screen our clients
very carefully.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.319
Why don't you take...
you take, um,

15:43.321 --> 15:45.038
this packet home, look it over?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.739
I promise you,
we will

15:46.741 --> 15:48.608
find you a great guy.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.960
I am sorry
about what happened to Neil.

15:54.615 --> 15:58.051
So, Hot Date is Britney McCabe.

15:58.053 --> 15:59.802
She called Finest
after the date,

15:59.804 --> 16:01.671
sounding pretty upset.

16:03.123 --> 16:06.226
Speaking of, I got to go. Hey.

16:06.228 --> 16:08.061
Where have you been?
I have been trying to reach you.

16:08.063 --> 16:10.096
Evan told me
what happened with Josh.

16:10.098 --> 16:12.315
Can't believe the jerk didn't
wait till after the wedding.

16:12.317 --> 16:14.517
I know. But you're okay
with me bringing Evan?

16:14.519 --> 16:16.519
Because I can not be the only
one alone at that wedding.

16:16.521 --> 16:17.720
Actually...

16:17.745 --> 16:18.906
And I've had this
huge crush on him.

16:18.907 --> 16:20.473
Wait. You have?

16:20.475 --> 16:21.774
You're not mad, are you?

16:21.776 --> 16:23.409
No, no, no, I just didn't know.

16:23.411 --> 16:25.478
Oh, okay, good, because I never
would've acted on it, but

16:25.480 --> 16:27.480
now that you're bringing this
boyfriend, Vincent Zalanski...

16:27.482 --> 16:30.333
You'd thought you'd make your move.
Yeah. I know. Almost

16:30.335 --> 16:32.752
as crazy as you suggesting
we run out and buy Louboutins.

16:32.754 --> 16:34.170
(phone ringing)

16:34.172 --> 16:35.538
You have ten minutes
to get ready.

16:35.540 --> 16:36.923
Okay. Hi.

16:36.925 --> 16:38.875
VINCENT:
So I'm your boyfriend now?

16:38.877 --> 16:41.827
I did not say boyfriend.

16:44.498 --> 16:46.499
She misinterpreted.

16:46.501 --> 16:49.168
And this is starting
to become a habit.

16:49.170 --> 16:51.170
So,

16:51.172 --> 16:53.356
sounds like
I'm going to a wedding.

16:53.358 --> 16:56.392
Ah. That was just a dumb reflex.

16:56.394 --> 16:58.645
It's okay.
You don't have to explain.

16:58.647 --> 17:00.280
No, I'm going to get out of it.

17:00.282 --> 17:01.681
I'm gonna tell them at
the rehearsal dinner tonight,

17:01.683 --> 17:04.849
which I have to get ready for.

17:04.852 --> 17:07.236
Oh. Um, okay, yeah.

17:07.238 --> 17:10.189
Oh. Oh, um, we found a body.

17:10.191 --> 17:12.709
Yeah, there was a guy
in a steam room.

17:12.711 --> 17:16.212
You know, uh, maybe you don't
have to get out of it.

17:16.214 --> 17:18.381
The wedding?

17:19.215 --> 17:21.416
You know what?
You might be right.

17:21.419 --> 17:23.553
Mr. Blood-on-his-hands is
married to a matchmaker.

17:23.555 --> 17:25.871
She said she'd find me someone
for the wedding.

17:25.873 --> 17:27.723
She doesn't realize
that I am trying

17:27.726 --> 17:29.759
to arrest her husband
for murder.

17:35.482 --> 17:36.933
Uh...

17:36.935 --> 17:39.602
Okay, maybe I could go with you.

17:41.888 --> 17:44.607
Everyone thinks
I'm coming anyway.

17:44.609 --> 17:47.527
Vincent, I was kidding before.

17:47.529 --> 17:50.446
But I'm not. Uh...

17:50.448 --> 17:52.582
Look, I did a test today.

17:54.335 --> 17:57.837
Wasn't a scientific test,

17:57.839 --> 18:01.924
but in med school, you learn
that if a patient says

18:01.926 --> 18:04.460
that they feel better,

18:04.462 --> 18:06.462
then they're usually right.

18:06.464 --> 18:08.881
Doesn't matter
what the test shows.

18:08.883 --> 18:13.720
And... I... feel... better.

18:13.722 --> 18:15.772
Much better.

18:15.774 --> 18:17.890
But are you gonna risk
all of that

18:17.892 --> 18:20.643
because I don't want to go
to a wedding alone?

18:20.645 --> 18:22.762
It doesn't feel like a risk.

18:22.764 --> 18:26.232
Vincent, there are going to be
150 people there.

18:26.234 --> 18:27.767
Drunk people.

18:27.769 --> 18:30.003
Yeah, I'm not going to hurt anyone.
No.

18:30.005 --> 18:32.488
No, I'm...

18:32.490 --> 18:34.640
I'm just concerned about you.

18:34.642 --> 18:36.542
What if you're exposed?

18:36.544 --> 18:37.943
I mean, let's say

18:37.945 --> 18:39.445
you are better?

18:39.447 --> 18:41.247
What about your identity?

18:41.249 --> 18:44.300
You have been working for years
to fly under the radar,

18:44.302 --> 18:45.802
and then you're gonna

18:45.804 --> 18:48.287
introduce yourself
to a bunch of people

18:48.289 --> 18:49.756
from all over the place.

18:49.758 --> 18:51.557
And what about my dad?

18:51.559 --> 18:54.343
You're gonna talk to him
about your fake li in Denver,

18:54.345 --> 18:55.812
and-and then what?

18:55.814 --> 18:58.681
Then you're Vincent Zalanski
to him forever.

18:58.683 --> 19:00.566
It's not fair to you.

19:00.568 --> 19:03.686
I can handle being
Vincent Zalanski.

19:04.971 --> 19:06.856
Forever.

19:08.609 --> 19:11.277
But if anything bad
ever happened to you

19:11.279 --> 19:14.330
because I didn't want to go
to a wedding alone,

19:14.332 --> 19:17.483
I would never be able
to forgive myself.

19:17.485 --> 19:19.952
Thank you,

19:19.954 --> 19:23.539
but I cannot let you
do this for me.

19:24.541 --> 19:27.093
Okay.

19:31.765 --> 19:33.080
And then we live
happily ever after.

19:33.082 --> 19:34.849
(whooping, cheering,
and applause)

19:35.917 --> 19:37.784
And then we get to eat,
which I suggest we go do now.

19:37.786 --> 19:39.202
See you, boys.

19:39.204 --> 19:40.787
Uh, can I talk
to you guys for a second?

19:40.789 --> 19:44.424
Oh, Cat, I actually
have something for you.

19:44.426 --> 19:46.592
Oh. Wow, this is...

19:46.594 --> 19:50.162
wonderful, uh, but...

19:50.164 --> 19:53.216
What? We didn't spell it right?
No.

19:53.218 --> 19:55.018
It's-it's perfect.
Phew. Okay.

19:55.020 --> 19:59.105
I have to go talk to the wedding
planner about our song list.

20:00.173 --> 20:03.142
I'm sorry if she pushed
a little hard about...

20:03.144 --> 20:04.811
Vincent.
Yeah.

20:04.813 --> 20:06.145
Actually, I just... I wanted
to talk to you about this...

20:06.147 --> 20:09.181
No, no, you're taking him.
But...

20:09.183 --> 20:11.617
Well, what's the problem?
What, you think it's too fast?

20:11.619 --> 20:13.853
He'll be in the pictures,
and what if it doesn't work out?

20:13.855 --> 20:17.457
Yes, that's exactly it.
Honey, you're thinking too much.

20:18.358 --> 20:20.510
Ever since your mom died.

20:20.512 --> 20:23.246
The same thing
happened to me.

20:23.248 --> 20:25.298
When I first met Brooke,
I kept thinking

20:25.300 --> 20:27.250
of all the reasons
that it couldn't work.

20:27.252 --> 20:30.837
I'm too old. She's too
young. Your mother.

20:30.839 --> 20:33.973
And then I just realized--

20:33.975 --> 20:36.292
what am I waiting for?

20:36.294 --> 20:39.479
And here you are.

20:39.481 --> 20:43.182
Right. Proof that there's
no reward without the risk.

20:43.184 --> 20:46.569
So... you're taking him.

20:46.571 --> 20:49.889
Besides, I can enjoy
my wedding now,

20:49.891 --> 20:53.459
and not worry
about you.

20:54.361 --> 20:56.362
TESS:
<i>"Strong,</i>

20:56.364 --> 20:59.082
vulnerable,
intelligent, heroic?"

20:59.084 --> 21:01.334
Okay, I filled it out
late last night.

21:01.336 --> 21:04.170
You filled up
the whole thing.

21:04.172 --> 21:05.872
You didn't see
my dad's face.

21:05.874 --> 21:07.406
He was almost

21:07.408 --> 21:11.094
in tears when he found out
that I was bringing someone.

21:11.096 --> 21:12.929
So you want to turn this in?

21:12.931 --> 21:14.580
I don't know.
It's a case.

21:14.582 --> 21:16.015
So?
If we were undercover

21:16.017 --> 21:18.017
at a salon,
we'd get our hair done.

21:18.019 --> 21:20.002
Besides, your little visit
with Sabrina proved

21:20.004 --> 21:21.854
incredibly profitable.

21:21.856 --> 21:23.923
I just called her to
follow up on that message

21:23.925 --> 21:26.109
Britney McCabe left
after her date with Neil.

21:26.111 --> 21:28.027
Don't worry: I didn't
blow your cover,

21:28.029 --> 21:29.145
but listen to this.

21:29.147 --> 21:31.447
Sabrina, it's Britney.

21:31.449 --> 21:33.533
Look, I guess I had
too much to drink

21:33.535 --> 21:34.951
and things got out of control

21:34.953 --> 21:37.036
and I did something really bad.

21:37.038 --> 21:39.372
Almost sounds like a confession.

21:39.374 --> 21:41.958
Maybe Neil forced himself
on her; she fought back.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.962
Hang on, Tess.
She and Neil had sex.

21:45.964 --> 21:47.130
Maybe that's the bad thing

21:47.132 --> 21:48.614
she's talking about
on the message.

21:48.616 --> 21:50.166
Sex is a bad thing?
Maybe that's why

21:50.168 --> 21:51.717
you don't have a date
to the wedding.

21:51.719 --> 21:54.670
No, Tess, it's one
of Sabrina Meyer's rules.

21:55.956 --> 21:58.474
Looking for Watson?
Hey, JT.

21:58.476 --> 22:00.726
What I want to know is, when's
he getting on the payroll?

22:00.728 --> 22:02.145
'Cause he's living
on my salary,

22:02.147 --> 22:03.980
even though he's
doing your job.

22:03.982 --> 22:06.098
Okay, what is he talking about?

22:06.100 --> 22:09.352
I figured, if I can't be
your fake boyfriend,

22:09.354 --> 22:13.322
then maybe I can be
your fake, uh, detective.

22:14.908 --> 22:16.475
You went to my
crime scene?

22:16.477 --> 22:18.444
It's bogus.

22:18.446 --> 22:20.363
A resort in Kuwait.

22:20.365 --> 22:22.665
This must be what Neil was
talking to his lawyer about.

22:22.667 --> 22:24.316
Here's the thing:

22:24.318 --> 22:26.419
He alibi'd out. That's
what I came to tell you.

22:26.421 --> 22:27.920
Maybe it wasn't
blood on him,

22:27.922 --> 22:29.288
and it was that paint
you were looking at.

22:29.290 --> 22:31.007
JT, it was blood.

22:31.009 --> 22:32.425
Okay, wait, what paint?

22:32.427 --> 22:36.328
I found some red particle
in the floor.

22:36.330 --> 22:38.214
It was paint. It just...

22:38.216 --> 22:39.966
Look, you just seal them
with nail polish.

22:39.968 --> 22:41.467
I do it with all
of my shoes.

22:43.637 --> 22:46.338
Unless it was red polish

22:46.340 --> 22:48.674
on the sole
of somebody's designer shoe.

22:48.676 --> 22:49.725
I'm lost.

22:49.727 --> 22:51.360
Okay, so let's say

22:51.362 --> 22:53.279
that Drake found out that
Neil was going to expose him.

22:53.281 --> 22:54.480
He told his wife,

22:54.482 --> 22:57.016
whose livelihood depends
on his reputation.

22:57.018 --> 22:58.734
She takes matters
into her own hands.

22:58.736 --> 23:01.287
She kills Neil, panics,

23:01.289 --> 23:03.573
so her husband comes over
and cleans up the evidence.

23:03.575 --> 23:06.191
Which is why the
blood was on him.

23:10.664 --> 23:12.865
What?

23:14.134 --> 23:16.252
You're not fake.

23:17.704 --> 23:19.655
You're the real thing.

23:19.657 --> 23:21.807
(phone ringing)

23:25.145 --> 23:27.513
Chandler.

23:27.515 --> 23:30.766
Sabrina, hi, no, I just answer
my phone like that sometimes.

23:30.768 --> 23:32.652
It's her.

23:32.654 --> 23:37.156
Uh, no, I didn't get a chance
to fill out the entire thing.

23:37.158 --> 23:38.691
Oh, you did?

23:38.693 --> 23:41.744
She found a date for
me for the wedding.

23:41.746 --> 23:44.163
No, he sounds great,

23:44.165 --> 23:46.165
but I'm going to go alone.

23:46.167 --> 23:48.618
Yes, I will be in touch

23:48.620 --> 23:51.504
very soon,
I promise.

23:51.506 --> 23:53.289
I'm kind of bummed
she's our killer.

23:53.291 --> 23:54.624
Now my dad's gonna
have to worry

23:54.626 --> 23:56.208
about me the
entire wedding

23:56.210 --> 23:58.294
because I cannot find
someone to go with me.

23:58.296 --> 24:01.631
Okay, JT, do you
still have your tux?

24:01.633 --> 24:02.632
Vincent.

24:02.634 --> 24:04.350
No, you're
not going.

24:04.352 --> 24:06.202
No, it's not for me.

24:06.204 --> 24:09.588
You are going to take Catherine
to her father's wedding.

24:09.590 --> 24:11.057
What?
What?

24:11.059 --> 24:12.308
Your dad wants to see
you with someone.

24:12.310 --> 24:15.111
JT has a PhD.

24:15.113 --> 24:17.280
He cleans up
pretty nice,

24:17.282 --> 24:19.649
so he can be
your fake boyfriend--

24:19.651 --> 24:21.567
no strings,

24:21.569 --> 24:23.369
no risk.

24:23.371 --> 24:25.454
Food'll be good?

24:26.873 --> 24:28.958
All right, I'm in.

24:35.055 --> 24:37.056
Hello, Sabrina.

24:37.058 --> 24:39.275
You've got to be kidding me.

24:39.277 --> 24:41.328
I spent hours finding you
a wedding date.

24:41.330 --> 24:43.330
She posed as a client.

24:43.332 --> 24:44.698
We're not here to talk
about my love life;

24:44.700 --> 24:46.449
we're here to talk about yours.

24:46.451 --> 24:49.569
My client's love life is
none of your business.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.288
Except for when she's a person
of interest in a homicide.

24:52.290 --> 24:54.040
Oh, and your perfect
catch hubby--

24:54.042 --> 24:56.126
he's next door telling
my partner everything

24:56.128 --> 24:57.744
about his Ponzi scheme
of a business.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.462
What?

24:59.464 --> 25:02.081
Ms. Meyer doesn't have
any knowledge of that.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.267
Drake's business
is 110%

25:04.269 --> 25:06.519
legitimate.
BS.

25:08.773 --> 25:11.725
You sell "happily ever
after" like it's a recipe.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.977
No sex, don't be funny,
fix your flaws,

25:13.979 --> 25:16.029
and then you can have someone
as great as Drake.

25:16.031 --> 25:17.764
So how dumb do you look
if it's exposed

25:17.766 --> 25:19.098
that your grand prize

25:19.100 --> 25:20.567
is a booby prize?

25:20.569 --> 25:22.369
And I don't think
that's padding it.

25:22.371 --> 25:24.571
You bitch.
You knew Mendel was

25:24.573 --> 25:27.157
unavailable even before
the news of the murder broke.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.325
I meant, he was
already fixed up.

25:29.327 --> 25:31.294
Oh, with Britney,

25:31.296 --> 25:34.147
the woman that you set up
to be your fall guy.

25:34.149 --> 25:36.583
Neil said
that he liked

25:36.585 --> 25:38.468
petite brunettes.

25:38.470 --> 25:39.469
She's a curvy blonde.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.688
So why even set them up,

25:41.690 --> 25:45.124
except for the fact
that she has a record?

25:45.126 --> 25:48.294
So, how helpful is that
if she's the last one

25:48.296 --> 25:50.680
with him before
you shoot him?

25:50.682 --> 25:52.766
Oh, and you,
uh, you left

25:52.768 --> 25:54.768
your red nail polish
at the crime scene.

25:56.771 --> 25:58.621
I don't wear red nail polish.

25:58.623 --> 26:01.074
Not on your nails.

26:02.693 --> 26:05.478
Okay, Sabrina, let's go.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.664
It's clear they don't have
anything to hold you.

26:07.666 --> 26:10.533
Not yet, but we are
holding your husband

26:10.535 --> 26:12.001
on fraud charges.

26:13.370 --> 26:15.422
You have spent
your entire career telling women

26:15.424 --> 26:18.374
that if they are single,
they are broken.

26:18.376 --> 26:20.510
Look who's broken now.

26:24.198 --> 26:27.183
EVAN: <i>You did really well</i>
<i>with that footage, by the way.</i>

26:27.185 --> 26:30.136
I showed a sketch artist
the image that you picked out.

26:30.138 --> 26:31.771
What do you think?

26:31.773 --> 26:34.140
I wouldn't hang
it on my wall,

26:34.142 --> 26:35.525
but, yeah,
it looks like him.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.311
I'm gonna find this guy.

26:38.313 --> 26:40.196
JT:
<i>I'm from Denver?</i>

26:40.198 --> 26:41.614
I don't know anything
about Denver.

26:41.616 --> 26:42.899
You're an E.R. doc.

26:42.901 --> 26:45.118
It's okay.
You don't get out much.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.203
I don't know anything
about E.R. medicine either.

26:47.205 --> 26:49.956
This tux isn't going to fit,
and I hate bow ties.

26:50.791 --> 26:53.376
Her ideal date...

26:53.378 --> 26:58.331
is dinner on a rooftop
or hanging out on a fire escape.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.499
What are you talking about?

26:59.501 --> 27:01.668
This is about me.

27:08.759 --> 27:11.678
♪

27:11.680 --> 27:14.481
(laughter)

27:14.483 --> 27:17.484
Uh, he's having the steak...
Mm-hmm.

27:17.486 --> 27:18.852
...vegetarian...
Mm-hmm.

27:18.854 --> 27:21.521
...chicken,
and that's another steak.

27:21.523 --> 27:24.157
Is he still not here?

27:24.159 --> 27:26.576
Nope, just me and
the cater waiter.

27:26.578 --> 27:27.727
I don't understand
how he couldn't get

27:27.729 --> 27:28.995
his shift covered
at the hospital.

27:28.997 --> 27:30.413
(laughs)

27:30.415 --> 27:33.500
Paige, there is no
Vincent Zalanski.

27:33.502 --> 27:35.735
What?
I made him up.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.904
The music here is so good.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.589
Your sister doesn't have
a boyfriend.

27:39.591 --> 27:40.757
Oh, God.

27:40.759 --> 27:43.626
Yeah, I lied.
Why?

27:43.628 --> 27:45.929
You guys kept threatening to
put me at the singles' table.

27:47.381 --> 27:48.932
Our dad got married today.

27:48.934 --> 27:50.550
It's his wedding.

27:50.552 --> 27:52.185
Maybe we should focus on that.

27:52.187 --> 27:55.922
Maybe I should get us
some cocktails.

27:55.924 --> 27:59.726
There is just so much pressure
to have a plus-one,

27:59.728 --> 28:02.762
like if you don't,
you're damaged or broken.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.598
We don't think
you're damaged or broken.

28:08.936 --> 28:11.821
Maybe I am.

28:11.823 --> 28:13.873
I don't know if I'm ever going
to have that.

28:13.875 --> 28:16.743
(indistinct chatter)

28:16.745 --> 28:18.545
We all feel like that.

28:18.547 --> 28:20.663
Yeah, my fiancé tried

28:20.665 --> 28:22.332
to call
our wedding off twice.

28:22.334 --> 28:25.952
Yeah, and I just got dumped
right after our brunch.

28:26.804 --> 28:28.471
Tom and I are separated.

28:28.473 --> 28:29.505
HEATHER:
Oh, my God,

28:29.507 --> 28:30.506
Paige.

28:30.508 --> 28:31.674
Hey.

28:31.676 --> 28:33.660

(glass clinking)

30:37.195 --> 30:40.613
Hey, everybody, uh, my wife...

30:40.615 --> 30:42.598
(cheering and applause)

30:42.600 --> 30:44.066
Thank you.

30:44.068 --> 30:45.951
...would like to remind everyone
that dinner is served,

30:45.953 --> 30:49.572
and it's actually pretty good
for wedding food,

30:49.574 --> 30:51.874
so, please...

30:53.076 --> 30:55.411
Okay, come on.

30:57.547 --> 30:59.632
Hey, what are
you doing? Hey.

30:59.634 --> 31:01.917
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:01.919 --> 31:03.669
I didn't come here to hide.

31:03.671 --> 31:05.337
I'm here because
I want to be.

31:05.339 --> 31:06.889
Besides,

31:06.891 --> 31:09.592
I did my Denver research;
I got my story down.

31:09.594 --> 31:11.794
Yeah.

31:11.796 --> 31:14.063
What?

31:14.065 --> 31:15.797
I confessed.

31:15.799 --> 31:18.133
I told them that there is
no Vincent Zalanski.

31:18.135 --> 31:20.352
Oh.

31:20.354 --> 31:21.303
It doesn't matter.

31:21.305 --> 31:23.939
My dad-- he is so happy.

31:23.941 --> 31:25.908
Who cares if people think
I don't have a plus-one?

31:25.910 --> 31:27.809
Hey, I am standing
right here.

31:27.811 --> 31:30.162
At least introduce me
to the people

31:30.164 --> 31:31.447
you didn't confess to.

31:31.449 --> 31:34.816
I don't think I need to.

31:38.004 --> 31:40.706
I think... that I lied

31:40.708 --> 31:45.327
because... I feel like I do
have someone in my life.

31:45.329 --> 31:48.130
And it wasn't that I wanted
to show him off; it's...

31:48.132 --> 31:51.634
just that I wanted him
to be here.

31:51.636 --> 31:54.803
But there are things about you

31:54.805 --> 31:58.390
that neither of us
can change, so...

31:59.442 --> 32:02.678
So it wasn't really a lie then.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.147
You just got his
last name wrong.

32:05.149 --> 32:07.015
And his hometown.

32:07.017 --> 32:08.317
Well...

32:09.653 --> 32:11.353
You know, um...

32:11.355 --> 32:13.656
he is hungry.

32:13.658 --> 32:15.357
Oh. Steak or chicken?

32:15.359 --> 32:18.410
Uh... surprise me.

32:18.412 --> 32:20.245
Okay.

32:21.982 --> 32:26.135
HEATHER:
Oh, my God, I think I'm in love.

32:26.137 --> 32:28.203
Evan's, like, the smartest guy
I've ever dated.

32:28.205 --> 32:30.589
Okay, I think you
need to slow down.

32:30.591 --> 32:32.725
Wait, why?
Are you in love with him?

32:32.727 --> 32:36.095
No. I told you, he's...
he's a flirt.

32:36.097 --> 32:38.771
Oh, my God, you <i>are</i> in love
with him. I can tell.

32:38.774 --> 32:41.934
Heather, you are drunk and
you are rebounding,

32:41.936 --> 32:43.051
and I just don't think

32:43.053 --> 32:45.638
that he is the person
for you to do that with.

32:46.873 --> 32:48.774
Yeah, but he's so smart.
(groans)

32:48.776 --> 32:51.160
Did you know that he just
got some major grant

32:51.162 --> 32:52.411
on DNA research?

32:52.413 --> 32:55.063
DNA? No, I...
Yeah, apparently,

32:55.065 --> 32:57.032
there's some weird DNA
that's mutating or something.

32:57.034 --> 32:58.917
Mutating? How?

32:58.919 --> 33:01.954
I don't know. I was too
distracted by his hotness.

33:01.956 --> 33:04.757
But listen to me,
you're here alone,

33:04.759 --> 33:07.409
and I'm blabbing
about... Evan!

33:07.411 --> 33:09.378
Hi.
I see I should've got two.

33:09.380 --> 33:10.879
(laughs)

33:10.881 --> 33:13.098
Heather, could I talk
to your date for a minute?

33:13.100 --> 33:15.134
It's just...
it's about work.

33:15.969 --> 33:17.019
Yeah.

33:17.021 --> 33:19.138
Okay.
Okay.

33:20.056 --> 33:22.257
Thought that your coming out
was very brave.

33:22.259 --> 33:25.277
Yeah, listen, Heather said
that you're doing research

33:25.279 --> 33:26.445
on DNA.

33:26.447 --> 33:28.197
I thought you'd
let that go.

33:28.199 --> 33:29.481
Actually, you let it go.

33:29.483 --> 33:31.316
Which I understand.
So it's

33:31.318 --> 33:33.902
on cross-species DNA?
Too much has happened

33:33.904 --> 33:35.270
for me to just dismiss it.

33:35.272 --> 33:37.773
I mean, I know what
I heard in that subway.

33:37.775 --> 33:38.957
And the corrupted samples.

33:38.959 --> 33:40.492
Now I've got someone
breaking in to my lab.

33:40.494 --> 33:43.078
Wait. Do you know who?
I don't.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.080
I've got a sketch.
I think they're trying

33:45.082 --> 33:46.498
to access what I'm finding.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.834
What are you finding?

33:48.836 --> 33:51.003
Heather said something
about mutations.

33:51.005 --> 33:53.005
The samples from the cases
that I collected,

33:53.007 --> 33:55.974
including your mom's,
indicate that the L2 capsids

33:55.976 --> 33:59.127
are targeting changes in the
basic structure of the DNA.

33:59.129 --> 34:01.063
Okay, what does that mean?

34:01.065 --> 34:03.282
They're coming
from the same being.

34:03.284 --> 34:06.518
Are you sure?
Yeah.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.303
And whatever it is...

34:08.304 --> 34:11.156
it's changing.

34:11.158 --> 34:12.991
It's changing how?

34:12.993 --> 34:14.443
It's complicated.

34:14.445 --> 34:17.112
But basically,
the animal nucleotides

34:17.114 --> 34:19.915
are taking over
from the human ones.

34:19.917 --> 34:22.751
He's becoming less human?

34:22.753 --> 34:25.120
Or <i>it.</i>

34:26.089 --> 34:27.989
Anyway, this isn't...

34:27.991 --> 34:30.158
wedding small talk.

34:31.210 --> 34:32.344
How about that dance?

34:32.346 --> 34:35.797
Actually, I am starving,

34:35.800 --> 34:37.433
so, um...

34:38.851 --> 34:40.803
Later.

34:40.804 --> 34:42.271
Definitely.

34:48.862 --> 34:50.562
Got you both.

34:50.563 --> 34:52.281
Wow. Thanks.

34:52.283 --> 34:54.616
Do you, uh... want some?

34:54.618 --> 34:56.568
No, I'm good.

34:56.570 --> 35:00.021
(amplified rapid heartbeat)

35:00.023 --> 35:02.324
No, you're not.

35:04.828 --> 35:08.163
You know how you said
you felt different?

35:08.165 --> 35:10.632
I think I know why.

35:10.634 --> 35:14.052
I ran into Evan, and it turns
out he's been studying you,

35:14.054 --> 35:16.255
your DNA.

35:16.257 --> 35:18.173
Okay.

35:18.175 --> 35:21.260
He says it's mutating.

35:22.428 --> 35:25.013
How do you mean?
He mentioned this...

35:25.015 --> 35:26.815
L2 something?

35:26.817 --> 35:29.050
L2 capsid? Yeah,
what about it?

35:29.052 --> 35:31.687
He said it's
becoming more...

35:33.072 --> 35:35.190
More what?

35:35.192 --> 35:37.109
What did he say?

35:37.111 --> 35:39.578
He said it's becoming
more animal.

35:39.580 --> 35:41.246
(laughs softly)

35:41.248 --> 35:44.283
No. No, I feel great.

35:44.285 --> 35:46.835
What if that's what
the blackouts were?

35:46.837 --> 35:49.338
No, JT would've caught it.
JT...

35:49.340 --> 35:51.072
wouldn't know;
he doesn't have the equipment.

35:51.074 --> 35:53.575
That's why we had
to break in to the morgue.

35:53.577 --> 35:55.844
Which...

35:55.846 --> 35:57.429
I'm pretty sure
Evan knows about.

35:57.431 --> 35:59.381
Seems you
were right.

35:59.383 --> 36:02.217
This was... too big a risk.

36:02.219 --> 36:03.752
But nothing bad has happened.

36:03.754 --> 36:05.637
Yet.

36:07.357 --> 36:09.641
I should probably go.

36:13.947 --> 36:17.432
This is what I was afraid of.

36:17.434 --> 36:19.368
That you would...

36:19.370 --> 36:22.237
come here and that
we would have fun, and...

36:22.239 --> 36:23.939
And remember the fact

36:23.941 --> 36:26.441
that there's no
Vincent Zalanski.

36:27.961 --> 36:31.563
I guess this was just too much
of a risk for both of us.

36:42.258 --> 36:44.109
(exhales)

36:45.808 --> 36:49.245
Hi. Um, for those of you
who don't know me,

36:49.345 --> 36:50.928
I'm Catherine Chandler.

36:50.930 --> 36:54.264
(laughs):
Um, I'm my dad's daughter.

36:54.266 --> 36:56.016
His oldest daughter.

36:56.018 --> 36:57.551
Um...

36:57.553 --> 37:00.854
Okay, I wrote this speech,
like, a week ago.

37:00.856 --> 37:03.273
(laughter)
And... seeing the way

37:03.275 --> 37:06.276
that my dad and Brooke
look at each other, it...

37:06.278 --> 37:09.363
sums up more
than these four pages can.

37:09.365 --> 37:10.731
Um...

37:18.907 --> 37:22.142
You know, the funny thing is,
is that...

37:22.144 --> 37:25.512
Brooke and my dad
shouldn't even be together.

37:29.116 --> 37:31.001
(laughs):
No, it...

37:31.003 --> 37:32.553
it's true, you know?

37:32.555 --> 37:34.338
For starters,
they are complete opposites.

37:34.340 --> 37:37.123
And not to mention,
she is a Mets fan,

37:37.125 --> 37:41.595
(laughter) so... I don't know how
they're gonna deal with that.

37:41.597 --> 37:45.599
(laughs) And then there's
the age difference.

37:45.601 --> 37:49.319
And for a lot of people,
that would have held them back.

37:49.321 --> 37:52.022
Especially...

37:52.024 --> 37:55.192
given everything
we've been through.

37:58.913 --> 38:01.415
Not that being with Brooke
is a risk. It's not.

38:01.417 --> 38:03.250
She's...

38:03.252 --> 38:07.037
(laughs softly):
she is amazing.

38:07.039 --> 38:11.291
But... it's just
being in any relationship

38:11.293 --> 38:14.044
is that it-it's a...

38:14.046 --> 38:16.346
it's a risk.

38:17.549 --> 38:19.666
It's...

38:19.668 --> 38:23.103
it's accepting that
there are no guarantees.

38:23.105 --> 38:25.505
I mean, who knows
what the future brings,

38:25.507 --> 38:29.476
and-and... going for it, anyway.

38:31.345 --> 38:34.197
(laughs softly)

38:34.199 --> 38:37.150
Even if she is a vegan,

38:37.152 --> 38:39.403
and he eats cheeseburgers.

38:39.405 --> 38:40.537
(laughter)

38:40.539 --> 38:42.022
So...

38:42.024 --> 38:44.207
to my dad and Brooke...

38:46.694 --> 38:48.629
...for jumping in.

38:49.464 --> 38:51.665
You guys are an inspiration.

38:51.667 --> 38:52.716
Aw...

38:52.718 --> 38:55.586
Especially to me.

38:55.588 --> 38:57.137
(people clapping)

38:57.139 --> 38:58.388
Okay. (laughs)

38:58.390 --> 39:00.007
Cheers!

39:00.009 --> 39:02.509
(clapping continues)

39:08.049 --> 39:09.733
Hey, Heather, uh,
I need your keys.

39:09.735 --> 39:12.102
You're leaving?
Dad's okay with it.

39:12.104 --> 39:13.987
I just, I need
to go and find somebody.

39:13.989 --> 39:15.572
Who?
Evan,

39:15.574 --> 39:17.491
you're taking her home, okay?

How was the wedding
without a date?

40:16.435 --> 40:19.419
Sabrina...
Not so good?

40:19.421 --> 40:23.507
You ruined my happy-ever-after.
