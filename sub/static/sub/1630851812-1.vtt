21:13.524 --> 21:15.567
Mike didn't give me any help
with the baby.

21:15.651 --> 21:18.028
I was too busy and tired.
I'm sorry, Jenna.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.905
That's understandable.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.074
But you gotta remember,
even when you're tired,

21:22.157 --> 21:24.743
you gotta look your best
when you sell cosmetics.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.995
I've been trying for a week

21:27.079 --> 21:30.624
to get my daughter to wear
the mineral powder and the lip gloss.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.794
But she don't want to be like Mommy, so…

21:33.877 --> 21:36.296
Why does Mom always have to
have those meetings?

21:36.380 --> 21:37.798
She recruited those women.

21:37.881 --> 21:41.844
If they generate enough sales,
she gets to buy herself a lavender Lexus.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.888
When I go pro,
I can buy her three of those.

21:44.972 --> 21:46.265
What about me?

21:46.348 --> 21:48.267
I'm gonna send you to cooking school.

21:48.851 --> 21:49.977
Man, whatever.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.231
Jack, look at this.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.115
One of those mazes you used to draw.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.115
[Jackie] One of those mazes
you used to draw.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.368
Our father drew this one.

22:07.828 --> 22:08.871
What?

22:08.954 --> 22:10.372
Ten years ago today.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.085
Then how come you still have it?

22:16.545 --> 22:19.423
I don't know. Just do.

22:23.302 --> 22:25.053
[sighs]

22:25.137 --> 22:26.597
I think I may have found him.

22:27.931 --> 22:28.932
How?

22:29.016 --> 22:32.311
I did another search,
and it looks like he works in Florida.

22:32.978 --> 22:35.856
If I get an address,
maybe we could find a way to see him.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.357
Or talk to him.

22:39.526 --> 22:43.113
Nah. I don't want to talk to him.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.576
I just want him to know how good I am.

22:50.454 --> 22:51.455
[cell phone dings]

22:59.463 --> 23:03.592
[siren wailing]

23:59.064 --> 24:01.525
Emptying the trash
ain't the same as hanging out.

24:02.526 --> 24:04.528
His name is Jace Carson.

24:04.611 --> 24:08.282
He is an eighth-grade honor student
at Seat Pleasant Middle School.

24:08.365 --> 24:09.533
So help me God,

24:09.616 --> 24:11.910
-if you don't take those cuffs off my son…
-Ma'am!

24:11.994 --> 24:13.287
…I will have your badge!

24:13.370 --> 24:14.663
All right, stay right here.

24:16.707 --> 24:18.125
I need to talk to you a second.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.462
I think I know this kid.

24:22.546 --> 24:26.717
He's got videos all over the Internet.
I showed you one, remember?

24:26.800 --> 24:30.220
Fourteen-year-old basketball player.
Slam dunk contest.

24:30.304 --> 24:33.223
Shit. Take the cuffs off him.

24:34.683 --> 24:36.059
[grunts] Stand up.

24:35.309 --> 24:36.310
Stand up.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.561
[sighs]

24:39.021 --> 24:40.647
Baby, it's okay.

24:41.273 --> 24:42.274
[grunts]

24:45.068 --> 24:46.069
You all right?

24:47.446 --> 24:48.447
You okay?

24:54.161 --> 24:56.830
Next time you're outside late,
have some ID on you.

24:54.161 --> 24:56.830
[officer 1] Next time you're outside late,
have some ID on you.

24:56.914 --> 25:01.126
What, he needs ID to take out the trash?
Are you out your damn mind?

26:05.649 --> 26:08.861
Hey, scrub. What's up with you
not hitting me back last night?

26:10.737 --> 26:12.114
Didn't feel like talking.

26:12.865 --> 26:15.534
Have anything to do
with your ass getting spanked?

26:15.617 --> 26:16.910
What are you talking about?

26:20.455 --> 26:21.456
Damn.

26:21.540 --> 26:24.877
Dropped this morning,
and only 12,008 hits so far.

26:24.960 --> 26:28.130
Now, see, you could have played NBA 2K
with me instead.

26:28.213 --> 26:30.007
You still would have got your ass beat,

26:30.090 --> 26:32.426
but at least the whole world
wouldn't know it.

26:34.887 --> 26:37.222
Cops put cuffs on me last night.

26:40.267 --> 26:41.268
Wait, what?

26:42.186 --> 26:43.187
Yeah.

26:44.021 --> 26:45.647
They thought I jacked a car.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.734
That's crazy. You all right?

26:51.361 --> 26:52.779
Whole time I was thinking…

26:54.281 --> 26:57.159
I don't want to end up in no museum
because of something like that.

26:59.161 --> 27:00.996
I wanna be in there because I'm great.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.794
You got one job, scrub.

27:07.878 --> 27:11.548
Get on a killer team and show out
in front of Overtime this weekend.

27:13.008 --> 27:15.969
And when everyone across the country
watches you ball out,

27:16.053 --> 27:17.763
it'll start the NBA conversation.

27:18.847 --> 27:20.349
Like, for real.

27:20.432 --> 27:22.851
You won't even care about
those cops or the haters.

27:27.356 --> 27:29.566
What about you?
When are you back on the court?

27:30.275 --> 27:32.945
Still can't put pressure on it.
Doctor says a week or two.

27:33.028 --> 27:35.364
Got any more of that vegan brownie crap
you make?

27:44.790 --> 27:45.791
Let me tell ya...

27:46.583 --> 27:49.419
I been at this so long,
some of you played for me back in the day.

27:49.503 --> 27:50.838
That's right.

27:51.630 --> 27:55.050
My youngest daughter's in college now,
and it's still my livelihood.

27:56.593 --> 27:59.012
But some of your business practices
have been sloppy.

27:59.096 --> 28:01.640
And I don't want your greedy asses
messing it up for me.

28:01.723 --> 28:07.563
If the FBI can turn the NCAA upside-down,
imagine what it can do to us.

28:07.646 --> 28:09.648
Are you telling us to not make money?

28:07.646 --> 28:09.648
[man 1] Are you telling us
to not make money?

28:10.607 --> 28:12.985
Coach Max, no disrespect.

28:13.068 --> 28:15.863
You were one of the first coaches
to really get paid in the game.

28:15.946 --> 28:19.616
Whether I was compensated or not
ain't your business, or the damn point.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.286
Coach, I don't think
my man meant that as a slight.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.286
Whoa, Coach, I don't think
my man meant that as a slight.

28:22.369 --> 28:23.745
-No, not at all.
-Nah, not a--

28:23.829 --> 28:26.206
Come on,
you are a role model to most of us.

28:26.290 --> 28:27.541
-Right? Yeah.
-For sure.

28:27.624 --> 28:31.336
We're role models for these kids.
Keeping 'em off the streets

28:31.420 --> 28:34.047
and helping 'em get into college
is what we do.

28:34.548 --> 28:38.135
Joey, if a sneaker company offers you
a $100,000 donation

28:38.218 --> 28:41.096
because they think your players
positively reflect their brand,

28:41.180 --> 28:42.181
that's not illegal.

28:42.890 --> 28:47.769
Eddie, if you want to write off that
big-ass Escalade as a business expense

28:42.890 --> 28:47.477
Eddie, if you want to write off that
big-ass Escalade as a business expense…

28:47.561 --> 28:48.562
[all chuckle]

28:48.645 --> 28:51.398
so you can drive your players around,
that's not illegal.

28:48.645 --> 28:51.398
…so you can drive your players around,
that's not illegal.

28:52.232 --> 28:56.820
But telling a school program
that you can help them get a player

28:56.904 --> 28:58.906
if they break you off a little somethin'?

28:59.615 --> 29:01.783
That ain't a game
for sloppy-ass individuals.

29:58.841 --> 30:01.385
-So you're the only purist?
-I don't know. Am I?

30:02.094 --> 30:04.346
You're not the only one who played D-1.

30:04.429 --> 30:07.891
But yeah, I got two coaches on my payroll.
I'm about the purity and the cash.

30:07.975 --> 30:10.269
I gotta put my business degree
to good use.

30:10.352 --> 30:13.689
-So what you play? The one or the two?
-Point.

30:13.772 --> 30:15.941
If you ever want to go up
against someone grown,

30:16.024 --> 30:17.150
I'll hurt your feelings.

30:17.234 --> 30:18.443
[chuckles]

30:18.527 --> 30:22.197
You shouldn't let those guys piss you off.
They're just mad you got Jace.

30:22.281 --> 30:25.826
They act like I won the lotto. He's a kid.

30:27.369 --> 30:31.498
Yeah. He's a kid who got Overtime
coming to the game. It's a big stage.

30:31.582 --> 30:32.833
It's a bigger distraction.

30:33.542 --> 30:37.171
Don't act like you don't know
Carson's about to skyrocket your program.

30:37.671 --> 30:40.299
Too bad I'm gonna have to
take you down before liftoff.

30:37.671 --> 30:40.132
Too bad I'm gonna have to
take you down before liftoff.

30:40.215 --> 30:41.300
[Ike laughs]

30:41.383 --> 30:43.302
That was weak. You just think of that?

30:43.385 --> 30:46.388
See you on the court.
Don't be mad when we win.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.933
-You just jinxed yourself.
-We'll see.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.562
Yo, Earl, where you at?

30:52.102 --> 30:53.562
[Jace] Yo, Earl, where you at?

30:58.275 --> 30:59.776
What are y'all doing here?

31:56.959 --> 32:00.170
On and off the court. Here, we family.

32:00.254 --> 32:01.672
I already got a family.

32:01.755 --> 32:03.799
Jace, you need us as much as we need you.

32:04.466 --> 32:06.510
-[scoffs] Yeah, aight.
-[boy 2] Uh--

32:05.509 --> 32:06.510
Yeah, aight.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.888
No, Jace. Jace. Jace.
I can't let you do that.

32:11.849 --> 32:13.183
-Really?
-No, really.

32:14.184 --> 32:16.186
Sorry, big homey. But till we get this
straightened out,

32:16.270 --> 32:17.604
ain't nobody going nowhere.

32:26.780 --> 32:27.781
[groans]

32:29.992 --> 32:33.787
All right, y'all.
I didn't see that coming.

32:29.992 --> 32:33.787
All right, y'all.
I didn't see that coming. [mumbles]

32:33.871 --> 32:35.539
-[boy 1] Man, come on.
-[boy 2 groans]

32:34.454 --> 32:35.539
Man, come on.

32:44.089 --> 32:45.799
[sighs]

32:48.385 --> 32:50.929
[lo-fi hip-hop music playing]

33:59.456 --> 34:00.791
Sorry I'm late, Coach.

34:11.176 --> 34:12.969
You late, we all run.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.768
Everybody on the line.

34:21.436 --> 34:23.397
-There you go.
-Everybody on the line.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.038
Wanna see hustle!

34:45.918 --> 34:48.922
Godfather of the DMV. This is a surprise.

34:49.005 --> 34:51.132
With all this Rising Phenom hype,

34:51.216 --> 34:53.051
just thought I'd offer you my congrats.

34:53.135 --> 34:56.804
I'm more interested in Jace's long game
than being the flavor of the month.

34:56.889 --> 34:59.141
Which is exactly why we should talk.

35:01.768 --> 35:05.189
Whether it's bad coaching or the players
around him aren't next level,

35:05.272 --> 35:09.651
if they rack up Ls, Jace will be perceived
as a player who can't get it done.

35:09.735 --> 35:11.695
Or if they get Ws this season,

35:11.778 --> 35:14.823
he'll be perceived as
someone who can carry his team.

35:14.907 --> 35:16.450
If there's a team to carry.

35:16.533 --> 35:17.743
Excuse me?

35:18.243 --> 35:19.703
You have to ask yourself

35:19.786 --> 35:23.707
if a has-been with a crumbling program
can get Jace to the next level.

35:23.790 --> 35:24.791
"Crumbling"?

35:25.626 --> 35:26.668
With all due respect,

35:26.752 --> 35:29.838
how 'bout you stop implying shit
and just say the shit?

35:30.964 --> 35:34.426
He can barely cover his tournament fees
and practice facilities.

35:35.177 --> 35:39.389
By the middle of the season, it'll be
rest in peace, Seat Pleasant Grind.

35:40.474 --> 35:43.352
I know you did your homework,
and I respect that.

35:43.936 --> 35:47.523
But if you'd let me talk to you sooner,
I could've saved you a lot of trouble.

35:47.606 --> 35:51.818
Your son is on a sinking ship.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.

35:54.279 --> 35:55.697
Everybody bring it in.

35:56.323 --> 35:58.283
Great work today. Be proud of yourselves.

35:58.367 --> 36:02.412
-SP Grind on three. One, two, three!
-SP Grind!

36:02.996 --> 36:04.957
Good work. Good work today.

36:06.542 --> 36:08.377
You better make sure that you--

36:08.752 --> 36:11.171
Yo, Lou. Can you give me a minute?

36:11.672 --> 36:12.673
Yeah.

36:13.882 --> 36:15.259
You ready, son?

36:15.342 --> 36:17.845
-The question is, you ready, Pops?
-Am I ready?

36:17.928 --> 36:20.556
-Yeah. You ain't ready.
-That's what we doing?

36:20.639 --> 36:23.016
You still ain't paid Vince's dues.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.309
Damn. My bad, brother.

36:24.393 --> 36:28.021
I was juggling a couple things.
You think I can get it to you next week?

36:30.148 --> 36:31.692
-Next week?
-Next week.

36:33.151 --> 36:35.279
-All right.
-All right, man. Good looking.

36:38.448 --> 36:43.328
Yo, Coach, my mom's running late.
Could I put up some free throws?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.081
Bet.

36:54.381 --> 36:56.550
I watched some of your old games online.

36:56.633 --> 36:57.634
Oh, yeah?

36:58.302 --> 36:59.928
Glad you fixed that haircut.

37:00.429 --> 37:02.139
Back then y'all didn't have clippers?

37:02.222 --> 37:03.765
Okay.

37:03.849 --> 37:06.768
No, we didn't.
So what's your excuse for that up top?

37:07.686 --> 37:08.687
Jokes.

37:12.608 --> 37:15.194
Mind if I ask you
about that state championship team?

37:16.153 --> 37:17.154
If you have to.

37:19.948 --> 37:21.825
You were the leading scorer.

37:22.534 --> 37:25.871
But one of your teammates
made it to the NBA, and not you.

37:28.081 --> 37:29.291
That's not a question.

37:33.337 --> 37:36.423
I'm just wondering how come. Your height?

37:37.424 --> 37:39.968
I never used my height as an excuse. Ever.

37:42.387 --> 37:43.388
Then what?

37:48.310 --> 37:51.480
Too much… outside noise.

37:53.065 --> 37:54.066
What does that mean?

37:55.859 --> 37:58.779
If you get good enough, you'll find out.

38:03.200 --> 38:07.496
Well, when I get to the NBA,
I got your back.

38:07.579 --> 38:10.499
I'll pull some strings.
Get you on that coaching staff.

38:10.582 --> 38:13.961
Oh, yeah?
I can take that to the bank?

38:10.582 --> 38:13.961
[chuckles] Oh, yeah?
I can take that to the bank, huh?

38:14.545 --> 38:15.546
You know it.

38:15.629 --> 38:17.589
I'll be the greatest of all time.

38:15.629 --> 38:17.589
-[laughs]
-I'll be the greatest of all time.

38:18.382 --> 38:20.175
Kendrick Lamar of basketball.

38:20.259 --> 38:21.260
Stop!

38:21.969 --> 38:26.098
So, you saying in the history of hip-hop,
Kendrick the GOAT?

38:27.140 --> 38:28.308
"King Kunta."

38:28.392 --> 38:31.395
Yo, Jay-Z been doing it for three decades.

38:31.478 --> 38:34.022
Kendrick been here for 30 seconds,
and he the GOAT?

38:34.106 --> 38:35.107
And raised the bar.

38:35.190 --> 38:38.026
-What you talking about?
-You disrespectful.

38:35.190 --> 38:38.026
-What you talking about?
-[chuckles] You disrespectful.

38:38.110 --> 38:41.154
We gonna work on that.
I promise you, we gonna work on that.

38:46.535 --> 38:50.789
Coach, if we win the DMV tournament,
are we going to Florida for nationals?

38:51.915 --> 38:54.835
[sighs] We'll be eligible.

38:53.417 --> 38:54.835
We'll be eligible.

38:57.838 --> 38:59.715
Florida tournament costs money.

39:59.066 --> 40:03.737
Jenna, people are always gonna have
something to say, all right?

40:03.820 --> 40:05.906
But y'all shouldn't be stressing
about his exposure.

40:05.989 --> 40:07.741
You should be stressing
about his improvement.

40:07.824 --> 40:10.994
I gotta make sure
I'm making the right moves for my boy.

40:11.078 --> 40:12.996
-I understand that--
-No, you don't!

40:14.748 --> 40:16.291
Jace's father's a piece of shit.

40:17.292 --> 40:20.712
Jace has gotta watch his back
from thugs and police in our neighborhood.

40:20.796 --> 40:22.506
I have to get this right.

40:28.554 --> 40:30.472
Look, we'll see how this weekend goes.

40:30.556 --> 40:31.890
But out of respect,

40:31.974 --> 40:34.977
I just wanted to let you know
there are other teams on the table.

40:37.354 --> 40:38.355
Let's go.

40:44.236 --> 40:45.988
-All right, man.
-All right, Coach.

40:46.071 --> 40:49.533
First you won't let me leave the Grind,
now you're saying I gotta go?

40:50.242 --> 40:51.994
Decisions like this are life-and-death.

40:52.077 --> 40:54.830
-Then I should have a say, shouldn't I?
-Get in the car!

41:04.089 --> 41:07.217
Mom, that wasn't the first time
the cops rolled up on me.

41:09.136 --> 41:10.137
What?

41:11.221 --> 41:12.264
You don't think I know?

41:12.848 --> 41:15.559
When most people look at me,
the first thing they think is,

41:16.143 --> 41:17.769
that's a big n--

41:19.354 --> 41:20.689
That's a big N-word.

41:21.982 --> 41:25.110
I'm gonna be dealing with
that kind of stuff my entire life.

41:27.821 --> 41:29.031
Even when I make it.

41:29.615 --> 41:31.992
It's not just talented people who make it.

41:32.075 --> 41:34.912
It's talented people
who make the right decisions.

41:47.966 --> 41:49.635
Excuse me. Okay. All right.

41:49.718 --> 41:50.761
-Tamika?
-Yes?

41:50.844 --> 41:52.888
My name is Musa Rahaim.

41:52.971 --> 41:55.599
I sit two rows behind you
in math class, to your left.

41:55.682 --> 41:58.519
I mean-- I mean to your right.

41:58.602 --> 42:00.354
Anyway, you're new to our school.

42:00.437 --> 42:03.106
I also hear that you're from the Bay.
You know, Oakland?

42:03.190 --> 42:04.191
What do you want?

42:04.942 --> 42:07.861
I figured you might need
a Seat Pleasant tour guide.

42:07.945 --> 42:09.738
My cousin's been showing me around.

42:09.821 --> 42:11.031
And he has a car.

42:11.114 --> 42:13.283
Okay-- No, it's-- That's cool.

42:13.367 --> 42:18.372
Well, if his car breaks down or anything,
you let me know, all right?

42:18.872 --> 42:19.873
Just…

42:20.749 --> 42:22.668
Musa Rahaim, at your service.

42:25.170 --> 42:26.547
Damn, my game sucks.

42:27.214 --> 42:30.008
What up, Overtime family?
It's your boy, Overtime Larry.

42:30.092 --> 42:32.553
Tomorrow, I'll be heading down
to Seat Pleasant, Maryland

42:32.636 --> 42:35.931
to watch the boys at SP Grind
versus Team All Day.

42:36.014 --> 42:38.559
Let's see if the DMV can give us
that next Rising Phenom.

42:39.226 --> 42:41.728
Big O, better stop playing with me.

42:46.650 --> 42:48.277
Game day is a blessing.

42:49.695 --> 42:53.782
Thank you, Lord, for this opportunity

42:54.658 --> 42:57.995
that you have bestowed upon
your faithful servant, Jace.

42:58.078 --> 43:01.623
Sinning is doing less than
what we are capable of doing.

43:01.707 --> 43:04.084
So we ask you on this day…

43:05.377 --> 43:06.628
that you guide him

43:07.129 --> 43:12.384
and give him the strength and energy
it takes for him not to sin.

43:13.051 --> 43:14.970
We praise you, O Lord,

43:15.804 --> 43:18.307
for this dream
that you have placed in his heart.

43:19.683 --> 43:22.144
A dream that says,

43:22.227 --> 43:25.105
"I'm not just here to take up space.

43:25.189 --> 43:30.027
I'm here to be special
and to serve you to the highest."

43:30.777 --> 43:33.280
We welcome the obstacles.

43:34.781 --> 43:37.659
We know the mountains are not there
so he can retreat.

43:41.788 --> 43:46.752
We know, O Lord,
that the mountains are just a test.

43:47.336 --> 43:50.464
They are a test of determination and will.

43:51.298 --> 43:56.220
And so we say to those mountains,
no matter what form they come,

43:56.303 --> 43:58.972
whether it is a spiritual mountain,

43:59.056 --> 44:00.599
an opposing coach,

44:01.642 --> 44:03.977
or a self-inflicted mountain.

44:04.061 --> 44:06.188
In the name of our Lord and savior,

44:07.105 --> 44:08.106
we say,

44:08.857 --> 44:12.152
"Mountain, be moved."

44:25.499 --> 44:28.001
Yeah. Yo.

44:28.085 --> 44:29.086
Okay.

44:30.921 --> 44:34.007
Hey, we the Grind
How we rock, we gonna take a dub

44:34.091 --> 44:36.426
Hit 'em hard, molly wop
We don't share no love

44:36.510 --> 44:39.263
I dish it out to Drew
He gonna hit the shot

44:39.346 --> 44:41.890
I lob it up to Jace
He gonna dunk the rock

44:41.974 --> 44:44.476
Ay, Team All Day
We 'bout to kill 'em all

44:44.560 --> 44:47.145
We finna stomp on their squad
Cause they all soft

44:47.229 --> 44:49.565
Got the claws out
Yeah, we see the prey

44:49.648 --> 44:52.234
Hit it from far out
And from close range

44:52.317 --> 44:54.945
Yeah, we the Grind
Let's get it, what, what

44:55.028 --> 44:57.531
Hey, we the Grind
Let's kill it, what, what

44:57.614 --> 45:00.242
Go, Jace. Go, Jace.

45:00.325 --> 45:01.326
Go, Coach.

45:01.410 --> 45:02.661
-Go, Coach.
-No. Stop.

45:02.744 --> 45:04.079
-Go, Coach.
-Y'all, no.

45:04.162 --> 45:08.333
Go, Coach. Go, Coach. Go, Coach…

45:08.417 --> 45:14.923
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey!

45:18.468 --> 45:21.138
-Yo!
-Bring it in!

45:24.808 --> 45:27.144
-How y'all feeling?
-Good.

45:28.645 --> 45:30.314
-How y'all feeling?
-Good!

45:30.397 --> 45:32.816
Good. All right.

45:33.400 --> 45:36.528
Hold each other accountable today.
Feel me?

45:38.906 --> 45:43.577
Run the offense. Lock down defense.

45:46.038 --> 45:49.291
Show up not just for yourselves,
but for each other.

45:50.459 --> 45:54.004
Mus, my brother. Take us out!

45:54.630 --> 45:56.507
Come on. Let's go!

45:56.590 --> 45:59.676
Execute on three!
Execute on me! One, two, three!

45:59.760 --> 46:01.345
-Execute!
-Let's go!

46:01.428 --> 46:03.555
Let's go! Let's go!

46:03.639 --> 46:05.807
-Go!
-Go, go, go!

46:39.049 --> 46:40.217
Go, go. Come on.

46:41.927 --> 46:42.970
Watch it.

46:43.637 --> 46:45.931
-Go, go!
-Take it!

46:46.014 --> 46:47.224
Slam dunk.

46:47.307 --> 46:49.268
Let's go.

46:52.145 --> 46:53.230
That's him.

46:53.647 --> 46:56.024
-Let's roll!
-Here we go. Come on.

46:56.108 --> 46:58.402
Nice! There you go, baby. Yeah!

46:58.485 --> 47:00.195
That's right! That's right!

47:00.279 --> 47:02.489
Come on, y'all. Talk to each other!

47:02.573 --> 47:04.032
Good D, good D, good D.

47:08.412 --> 47:10.747
That's my boy! You better play!

47:10.831 --> 47:12.124
-It was--
-Okay, move. Pump it!

47:13.417 --> 47:16.461
Hustle! Hustle! Good job, there, Jace!

47:26.513 --> 47:28.056
-My bad.
-Break this up.

47:30.225 --> 47:32.269
Let's go! Lock it!

47:37.399 --> 47:38.609
That's all you!

47:42.988 --> 47:44.239
Let's go!

47:51.496 --> 47:52.497
Let's go!

47:53.707 --> 47:56.877
Y'all play like y'all got no heart.
Like y'all scared.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.921
-Like a bunch of little bitches!
-Coach.

48:06.470 --> 48:08.263
Show me something, fellas.

48:08.347 --> 48:10.432
Get your shit together
and show me something.

48:14.603 --> 48:16.897
Come on, y'all. We got this. Let's go.

48:16.980 --> 48:19.525
Get his grill! Get his grill!

48:20.108 --> 48:22.027
It's all you, Phil.

48:22.110 --> 48:24.029
Yeah! I see you, scrub.

48:25.781 --> 48:26.907
Move! Move!

48:26.990 --> 48:29.576
Back up. He's got no jump. He's overrated.

48:29.660 --> 48:32.538
Back up! His jump is weak. Overrated.

48:32.621 --> 48:35.207
He's got no jump, so back up.
Let him shoot. Overrated.

48:35.290 --> 48:39.044
Overrated. Overrated! Air ball.

48:39.127 --> 48:40.712
Rebound. Rebound. There we go.

48:40.796 --> 48:43.257
Keep shooting for me, gunslinger.
Fast break! Fast break!

48:45.634 --> 48:47.386
Move! Move! Move!

48:52.140 --> 48:55.185
You watching the same game I'm watching?
Overrated, boy.

48:58.981 --> 49:04.069
Now we playing, baby! Let's go, baby.
Let's go. There we go. Now we playing.

49:05.821 --> 49:07.364
Let's go, Jace.

49:10.659 --> 49:13.245
Time-out! Time-out!

49:19.626 --> 49:22.129
Hey, what's up? Come on.

49:22.212 --> 49:23.964
-You need to tone it down.
-What?

49:24.840 --> 49:27.050
Did you not hear me?
You have to tone it down.

49:27.134 --> 49:29.845
The game is 90% mental.
You want this victory, don't you?

49:30.429 --> 49:32.389
I want you to stop being a jackass more.

49:33.056 --> 49:35.309
Hate me now. Love me when we win.

49:36.310 --> 49:38.729
Open up, fellas. Check this out. You--

49:38.812 --> 49:42.065
Jace. You gotta play your game.

49:42.816 --> 49:46.653
If they can't get in your head,
they can't win.

49:46.737 --> 49:48.822
Period. You feel me?

49:50.490 --> 49:52.451
Don't let 'em do it to you.

49:53.452 --> 49:57.915
And the rest of y'all, this is basketball.

49:57.998 --> 49:59.833
Have some fun with it, baby!

50:01.502 --> 50:02.920
-Finish strong on three.
-Fun.

50:03.003 --> 50:05.297
-SP Grind! Let's go!
-Let's go!

50:05.380 --> 50:07.382
Defense, defense, defense!

50:17.976 --> 50:19.561
Overrated.

50:20.312 --> 50:22.773
You can't let him talk like that
the whole game.

50:22.856 --> 50:24.691
Come on. He's drawing out the whole game.

50:27.027 --> 50:28.278
Rebound!

50:28.362 --> 50:30.989
Come on, Jace! Get us all the way.

50:32.115 --> 50:35.160
Yeah! Yeah!

50:38.455 --> 50:40.249
I thought this kid was special.

50:42.042 --> 50:43.710
Four ticks left in the game, let's go!

50:59.434 --> 51:00.936
Two shots!

51:12.614 --> 51:14.116
Overrated.

51:15.325 --> 51:17.202
Overrated.

51:18.161 --> 51:19.705
Overrated.

51:21.206 --> 51:23.250
Haters are gonna hate.
Come on, Jace. You've got this!

51:23.333 --> 51:25.335
-Overrated.
-Shut the hell up.

51:25.419 --> 51:27.004
Overrated.

51:27.754 --> 51:28.922
Shut the hell up.

51:47.024 --> 51:49.151
Come on. We ain't got all day.

51:49.735 --> 51:51.403
Stand up. Let's go, let's go.

51:57.743 --> 52:00.954
Shake that off.
First step to Florida right here.

52:28.357 --> 52:29.441
Come on.

52:34.947 --> 52:38.158
Yeah. Good job, fellas. Good win, fellas.

52:38.242 --> 52:41.495
Good win, fellas.
Way to show me what you got.

52:46.124 --> 52:49.336
-Don't worry about it, bro.
-It's just a game.

53:24.830 --> 53:27.332
You cry every damn time you lose?

53:33.297 --> 53:36.216
My father would tell me
that I had to learn what it is to lose

53:36.300 --> 53:38.051
before I learn what it is to win.

53:40.554 --> 53:42.764
To me, that sounded like
learning to suffocate

53:42.848 --> 53:44.308
before I learned how to breathe.

53:44.391 --> 53:46.226
Yo, Coach. Please don't give me that

53:46.310 --> 53:50.522
"It's not about whether we win or lose,
it's about how we play the game" bullshit.

53:51.106 --> 53:53.150
All right, well,
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

53:54.735 --> 53:56.612
You was afraid of that moment, Jace.

55:03.679 --> 55:05.097
Overrated.

55:06.849 --> 55:09.268
That's how you feel.
That's what I'm saying.

55:13.105 --> 55:15.816
Everybody get a high-five.
Everybody get a high-five.

55:17.109 --> 55:19.611
Everybody get a high-five.
That's how we ball out.

55:21.905 --> 55:24.825
Next game we-- We good. We gonna
figure out what she wants to know.

55:24.908 --> 55:26.869
We gonna figure out
what she wants to be...

55:30.038 --> 55:32.332
Hey, it don't matter.

55:33.709 --> 55:36.378
-Hey, move the ball--
-Can I talk to you for a minute?

55:37.921 --> 55:40.048
I'll be back.
Figure out what y'all wanna eat.

55:40.132 --> 55:41.592
All right.

55:43.385 --> 55:46.388
Good game, man. You really made us
earn that one. I appreciate it.

55:48.765 --> 55:50.851
You know they're just kids, right?

55:51.435 --> 55:53.645
Jace… is a kid.

55:54.813 --> 55:56.481
We don't need to be
tearing young brothers down.

55:56.565 --> 55:58.192
We should be building them up.

56:00.068 --> 56:02.321
Is that why you were
too mentally weak to make it?

56:03.405 --> 56:04.990
Don't make it personal.

56:06.491 --> 56:09.369
Listen, man, if I destroyed
your prima donna, then so be it.

56:09.453 --> 56:11.163
Better find out now than later?

56:11.747 --> 56:13.790
As a matter of fact, now I think about it,

56:13.874 --> 56:17.544
I just did his mama, you,
and his little bitch ass a favor.
