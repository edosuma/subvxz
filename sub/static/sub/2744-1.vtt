01:28.666 --> 01:33.249
I first tasted semen
when I was seven years old.

01:37.791 --> 01:40.374
Nothing to say?

01:41.791 --> 01:44.957
It's certainly a startling opening line.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.707
What is that, irony?

01:48.583 --> 01:51.749
I'm sorry. Let's start again.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.665
What do you want to say to me?

02:01.875 --> 02:04.790
I'm here to listen
to whatever you have to say.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.999
I was raped by a priest
when I was seven years old.

02:09.208 --> 02:13.499
Orally and anally
as they say in the court reports.

02:14.791 --> 02:19.915
This went on for five years;
every other day for five years.

02:21.583 --> 02:27.474
I bled a lot, as you can imagine
I bled a terrible amount.

02:31.666 --> 02:36.207
- Have you spoken to anyone about this?
- I'm speaking to you, now!

02:36.958 --> 02:40.332
I mean,
have you sought professional help?

02:40.541 --> 02:44.540
Why? So I could learn how to cope? So
that I could learn how to live with it?

02:44.708 --> 02:49.457
Maybe I don't want to cope. Maybe I
don't want to learn how to live with it.

02:56.083 --> 03:00.249
Did you make a formal complaint?
Did you testify?

03:00.416 --> 03:02.665
The man's dead.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.624
I don't know what to say to you.

03:11.791 --> 03:15.040
I have no answer for you, I'm sorry.

03:15.208 --> 03:19.665
What good would it do
anyway if he were still alive?

03:19.833 --> 03:22.874
What would be
the point of killing the bastard?

03:23.000 --> 03:28.374
That would be no news. There's
no point in killing a bad priest.

03:28.541 --> 03:33.082
Killing a good one?
That would be a shock!

03:33.250 --> 03:36.207
They wouldn't know what to make of that.

03:37.416 --> 03:40.165
I'm going to kill you, Father.

03:40.233 --> 03:43.390
I'm going to kill you 'cause
you've done nothing wrong!

03:43.458 --> 03:46.832
I'm going to kill you
because you're innocent.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.665
Not right now, though.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.582
I'll give you enough time
to put your house in order.

03:55.750 --> 03:58.207
Make your peace with God.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.915
Sunday week, let's say.

04:04.125 --> 04:08.290
I'll meet you down by the beach,
down by the water there.

04:11.916 --> 04:17.665
Killing a priest on a Sunday!
That'll be a good one.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.874
Nothing to say to me, Father?

04:25.375 --> 04:30.624
Not right now, no. But I'm sure
I'll think of something by Sunday week.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.457
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.387
A little too much wine again, Mícheál?

06:06.041 --> 06:07.265
Sorry, Father.

06:07.475 --> 06:10.682
I'm wondering is this
some kind of ploy on your behalf.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.040
Ploy, Father?

06:12.083 --> 06:17.082
I've noticed my stocks of booze appear
to be... somewhat diminished of late.

06:17.150 --> 06:20.243
I'm wondering is this
some kind of ploy you're working?

06:20.268 --> 06:23.368
Cover up for the wine you've
been imbibing on the Q.T.

06:23.483 --> 06:27.999
I've no idea what you're talking about.
Father Leary noticed nothing amiss.

06:28.166 --> 06:31.090
Father Leary does not
know you as well as I do, Mícheál.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.890
He may well underestimate the
depths of your Machiavellian chicanery.

06:34.958 --> 06:36.374
Can I go now, Father?

06:36.541 --> 06:41.290
What's the hurry? Have they called
a meeting at Mafia Headquarters?

06:46.333 --> 06:48.707
On your way!

06:54.791 --> 06:58.540
Things you hear
in confession these days!

06:59.083 --> 07:02.707
- It's depressing.
- You have to detach yourself from it.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.932
We're here to provide solace. Your
personal feelings don't come into it.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.707
I know that!
What do you take me for?

07:11.500 --> 07:15.057
It's difficult, though.
The mess people make of their lives.

07:15.325 --> 07:18.582
What's the problem?
Without going into details, obviously.

07:18.650 --> 07:21.274
That woman with the big black eye,
have you seen her?

07:21.283 --> 07:23.999
- Veronica Brennan. Yeah.
- She's an odd one.

07:24.166 --> 07:28.999
Things she comes up with. Think she's
trying to drag you down into the muck.

07:29.066 --> 07:31.215
Do you know what "felching" is?

07:31.283 --> 07:33.115
I do know what "felching" is, yeah.

07:34.033 --> 07:37.740
- I had to look it up.
- This is you not going into details?

07:37.750 --> 07:42.499
Sorry. Anyway, whatever is wrong with
her has obviously gotten out of hand.

07:42.708 --> 07:44.457
She's got knocked around now.

07:44.625 --> 07:47.007
Well if you say it to her
she'll raise holy hell.

07:47.016 --> 07:50.357
Say it on the basis
of something she said during confession.

07:50.525 --> 07:52.665
I know, I know, we can't have that.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.540
She could be excommunicated, the cow.

07:56.958 --> 08:01.915
I'll have a word with her. Jack as well.
Pastoral duties and what have you.

08:02.083 --> 08:05.965
Nothing to do with her confession.
See what's going on.

08:06.833 --> 08:12.040
That colored fellow, the... Ugandan.
He's one of her lovers, I think.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.082
Simon's from the Ivory Coast.

08:14.375 --> 08:20.374
Right. I knew it was that or Guyana
or one of those African countries.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.624
Guyana is in South America.

08:24.416 --> 08:29.665
Don't think so, Father.
I was always pretty good at Geography.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.915
Not bad!

08:55.083 --> 08:57.374
Surprisingly.

08:57.875 --> 09:01.624
I was expecting a daub.

09:04.125 --> 09:06.624
Who are these two lads?

09:07.750 --> 09:11.665
Don't know.
I'm reading these ghost stories.

09:11.833 --> 09:14.071
Maybe it's got
something to do with that.

09:14.096 --> 09:15.596
Spooky.

09:58.791 --> 10:01.165
So, did you know who it was?

10:01.333 --> 10:03.415
Yes, I know who it was.

10:03.791 --> 10:05.790
Do you know him well?

10:05.958 --> 10:07.249
Well enough.

10:07.416 --> 10:12.124
Knowing this man as you do...
Do you think it was an idle threat?

10:12.833 --> 10:15.082
I don't know. I'm not sure.

10:15.291 --> 10:18.290
If you're not sure,
it means it's possible.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.540
Yes, I suppose.

10:21.666 --> 10:24.082
You didn't grant him
absolution, obviously?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.915
He didn't ask for it.

10:27.500 --> 10:32.940
There you have it. The man is not
penitent. There's no contrition.

10:33.583 --> 10:39.549
He's threatening to commit a crime,
not asking for forgiveness for one.

10:39.958 --> 10:43.332
The inviolability of the
sacramental seal does not apply.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.082
You're saying I should go to the police?

10:46.833 --> 10:49.790
I'm not saying anything, James.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.624
The choice is yours.

11:11.708 --> 11:14.999
Don't tell me,
you made the classic error.

11:15.541 --> 11:19.165
You're supposed to cut down, not across.

11:29.708 --> 11:31.207
This is Bruno.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.290
And I always
wanted a fast car, a red one.

11:34.291 --> 11:37.165
I thought you'd already
had your midlife crisis?

12:02.625 --> 12:05.332
You're a very nice-looking young woman.

12:06.541 --> 12:07.760
Thank you.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.087
I like your bow tie.

12:11.074 --> 12:12.502
It's got polka dots.

12:12.750 --> 12:16.082
This is my daughter Fiona, Milo.
She's over from London.

12:16.250 --> 12:19.957
- You're having me on.
- I'm not having you on.

12:19.958 --> 12:20.736
But you're a priest.

12:20.911 --> 12:23.790
I was married before I became a priest.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.664
My wife and I had a child - Fiona.
My wife died...

12:26.689 --> 12:29.089
and after that I joined the priesthood.

12:31.416 --> 12:35.165
- You can do that, can you?
- It would appear so.

12:35.375 --> 12:38.999
Don't tell me.
You made the classic error.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.290
- I've already done that guide, Frank
- You're supposed to cut down.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.915
- I said I've already done it!
- Now, now!

12:45.833 --> 12:48.032
Drop of the hard stuff for yourself.

12:48.141 --> 12:52.632
A generous serving of the old water of
life for this beautiful, yet troubled...

12:52.741 --> 12:54.665
Fuck off!

12:54.833 --> 12:58.540
An exceedingly dotty mouth.
I like that in a whore.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.665
Brendan, now's not the time.

13:03.208 --> 13:06.749
Whatever you say, Father.
You're the boss.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.665
How's that working out for you?

13:11.875 --> 13:15.040
- I haven't been out in a good while.
- So you say.

13:15.208 --> 13:19.082
No, no. I've been a very good lad.
And don't change the subject.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.165
What was the subject?

13:21.375 --> 13:26.182
- You know what the subject was.
- Oh, daddy, a man. A man, what else?

13:26.225 --> 13:28.290
It's getting to be a habit, honey.

13:28.458 --> 13:32.624
I know. It's pathetic,
I can't do anything right.

14:14.666 --> 14:16.582
Nice shades.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.749
Do they make me look like Jackie O?

14:19.791 --> 14:21.915
Not really.

14:24.791 --> 14:28.874
This what you came to go about?
Nasty, huh?

14:29.041 --> 14:30.707
Interesting color.

14:30.716 --> 14:34.490
They say you can find beauty
in everything, if you look hard enough.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.665
And I'd say you can
find beauty in most things.

14:37.958 --> 14:41.082
Not everything. That's nonsense.

14:41.291 --> 14:44.707
What would I know?
I'm just an old washer woman.

14:44.816 --> 14:47.749
Listen, if you don't
want to talk to me, that's fine.

14:47.791 --> 14:50.090
I'm not here
to compel you to do anything.

14:50.100 --> 14:54.824
You never know, Father. Maybe I'd like
to be compelled. Maybe I'd enjoy it.

14:56.750 --> 15:00.332
I'll have a word with Jack.
See what he has to say for himself.

15:00.541 --> 15:04.207
Grand Inquisitor?
Go and hear for yourself.

15:04.375 --> 15:07.665
I'm sure he'll be only too pleased to
have someone else to bore the ears off.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.415
I stopped listening
to his old shite a long time ago.

15:10.625 --> 15:13.832
That's how it is, is it?
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

15:14.041 --> 15:17.665
You thought we were another
Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier?

15:17.833 --> 15:21.690
I know it wasn't a very happy marriage.
So it's not a great analogy.

15:23.666 --> 15:26.832
You know that's what
I've always liked about you, Father.

15:26.857 --> 15:29.457
You're just a little
too sharp for this parish.

15:29.541 --> 15:34.624
Fine fellow he was. Decapitated the
two of them. Blood all over the place.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.040
- Hi, Father.
- Jack.

15:39.791 --> 15:43.332
Could I have a word?
In private.

15:43.541 --> 15:45.415
Sounds ominous.

15:46.833 --> 15:49.832
Where's Johnnie Cochran
when you need him?

15:54.916 --> 15:59.999
I hope we don't get locked in here.
We'd have to make love to keep warm.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.874
I had a word with Veronica, Jack.

16:05.875 --> 16:08.915
Out at the house, are you?
Is everything all right?

16:09.083 --> 16:13.082
Everything's fine.
I mean now, everything's not fine.

16:13.750 --> 16:17.082
Mass on Sunday?
With the shades and everything.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.249
- Oh, that.
- Yes, that.

16:19.258 --> 16:21.474
Are you laying into her
or what's going on?

16:21.541 --> 16:25.490
I wasn't mean to her. No. That's that
black fellow that she's been seeing.

16:25.533 --> 16:27.707
I mean that colored
fellow she's been seeing.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.257
I didn't mean to be racist,
that was a slip of the tongue.

16:30.266 --> 16:34.665
- You're saying he beat her up?
- That's what I'm assuming. Yeah.

16:34.833 --> 16:40.249
The way she speaks in riddles.
I can't make any sense out of her.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.774
I think she's bipolar. Or lactose
intolerant. One of the two.

16:44.841 --> 16:47.749
I don't know where
I am with her anymore, Father.

16:47.816 --> 16:51.432
And if I'm honest with you, I'm kind
of glad to have her off my hands.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.499
Even if this fellow
is knocking her about?

16:53.508 --> 16:55.274
What's it to do with me!

16:55.316 --> 16:56.749
What?

16:57.041 --> 16:59.915
Not everyone can carry
the weight of the world!

17:00.083 --> 17:02.421
What about your marriage?
The oaths you took?

17:02.521 --> 17:03.940
The oaths I took!

17:05.125 --> 17:06.874
Listen...

17:07.458 --> 17:12.582
She's happier, now that she's
seeing him. A lot more settled down.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.940
Like a lot calmer.
And I'm not under surveillance anymore.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.765
I can just reel in at
whatever time I like.

17:19.290 --> 17:22.964
So everybody's happy!
Where's the harm in that?

17:27.125 --> 17:29.707
Shall I cut you
a side of beef to take home?

17:29.916 --> 17:31.957
It's freshly slaughtered.

17:34.416 --> 17:37.099
- Simon.
- Hello, Father.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.540
Why the visit today?

17:41.708 --> 17:43.790
It's not about my car.

17:43.916 --> 17:47.407
It's about Mrs. Brennan.
You're her boyfriend.

17:49.483 --> 17:53.165
I fuck her from time to time.
Does that make me her boyfriend?

17:53.208 --> 17:54.206
Does around here.

17:54.306 --> 17:57.707
She has a lot of boyfriends, I've heard.

17:57.916 --> 18:00.124
How many?

18:00.291 --> 18:03.707
You want me to confess to adultery?
Is that why you're here?

18:03.750 --> 18:04.974
Somebody beat her up.

18:05.041 --> 18:07.540
- Did she tell you I beat her up?
- No, she didn't.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.790
Then why are you here?

18:10.083 --> 18:12.415
Somebody beat her up.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.040
It's either you or the husband.

18:16.083 --> 18:19.207
I don't think Jack would beat her up.
He's not the type.

18:19.375 --> 18:21.457
What is the type?

18:24.833 --> 18:27.915
- Some of them like to be hit, you know?
- Who?

18:28.083 --> 18:30.824
White women, Irish women.
Do not ask me why.

18:30.849 --> 18:33.835
- You'd have to be a psychiatrist.
- That's nonsense.

18:33.870 --> 18:34.870
No, no.

18:34.958 --> 18:37.624
They like to be hit.

18:37.791 --> 18:40.790
In certain situations,
they beg for it in fact.

18:40.958 --> 18:43.415
So she got what was
coming for her, did she?

18:43.625 --> 18:47.457
- I was speaking generally.
- Oh, you were speaking generally.

18:47.708 --> 18:50.624
Well, I'm speaking specifically.

18:51.208 --> 18:54.215
- Don't do it again.
- You cannot tell me what to do!

18:54.383 --> 18:57.499
- We're not in the missions now.
- Oh, the missions! Right.

18:57.566 --> 19:00.049
Are you going to chop off
my hand if I disobey you?

19:00.116 --> 19:01.982
You know your history. That's grand.

19:02.050 --> 19:03.165
I like to read.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.674
You probably think that black people...

19:05.841 --> 19:09.499
Yeah, yeah. Black people, white people.
Blah, blah, blah.

19:11.125 --> 19:15.749
Run along now, Father.
Your sermon is finished.

19:19.708 --> 19:21.449
Better watch your step there.

19:21.916 --> 19:22.957
Why is that?

19:23.125 --> 19:27.457
If he was him who was laying into her,
you have to tread very carefully there.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.999
It's a very sensitive area.

19:31.708 --> 19:35.332
You'll have to explain this to me.
I'm afraid you've lost me completely.

19:35.500 --> 19:41.207
The Church can't be seen to be getting
involved in matters of diversity.

19:41.458 --> 19:43.132
Do you know?

19:43.141 --> 19:47.290
You mean if he's beating her up as one
of those ethnic rituals or something?

19:47.358 --> 19:50.140
Like when they do that
thing when they shake hands!

19:52.333 --> 19:54.457
You're mocking me now, I can tell!

19:54.500 --> 19:58.082
We have to be very circumspect in
those areas. That's all I'm saying.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.799
I'll be very circumspect, Father.
Don't you worry about that.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.749
How's all?

20:25.916 --> 20:28.249
At death's door. You?

20:28.458 --> 20:33.957
Same. Still using the old typewriter,
I see. You have an affectation?

20:34.208 --> 20:36.949
My whole life has been an affectation.

20:37.116 --> 20:41.532
One of those lines that sounds witty
and doesn't actually make much sense.

20:41.666 --> 20:43.665
Caught out again.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.040
How's the latest masterpiece going?

20:46.083 --> 20:49.915
Better than "Cecilia Hearn"
but not as good as "Beffield".

20:50.125 --> 20:51.999
Wish I could say that about everybody.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.665
What have you got for me?

21:05.750 --> 21:07.707
Need anything else?

21:08.791 --> 21:11.224
- A gun.
- Yeah?

21:12.125 --> 21:15.457
A Walther PPK.

21:15.666 --> 21:20.999
Bond's weapon of choice. Old Adolph
killed himself with one in the bunker.

21:21.208 --> 21:22.540
That's the plan, is it?

21:22.583 --> 21:26.915
No intention of riding around in agony
for hours on end when the time comes.

21:26.940 --> 21:30.210
Not knowing who I am or where I am.

21:30.375 --> 21:31.832
It's nonsense.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.207
Pragmatism.

21:34.366 --> 21:36.165
Where would I get a gun from?

21:36.208 --> 21:38.124
Come on, now. Give me a break.

21:38.166 --> 21:41.415
You've never been short of
guns in this country, have you?

21:43.166 --> 21:46.374
You're awfully mournful today,
I must say.

22:01.833 --> 22:04.582
You don't have any photographs.

22:06.208 --> 22:08.290
No.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.124
I'm in agreement with the
Apaches on that score.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.624
The Apaches?

22:13.666 --> 22:16.957
The Apaches. The Arapaho.

22:17.125 --> 22:19.490
The Hunk papa Sioux.

22:26.916 --> 22:28.749
Not even one of Mum?

22:31.291 --> 22:34.457
Don't need a photograph
to remember your mother.

22:38.708 --> 22:43.749
Memories fade. That's what's
so terrible about them.

22:46.875 --> 22:49.249
No, they don't.

22:49.416 --> 22:51.499
Not really.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.082
I should buy a cane.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.582
It'd suit you.
You're old beyond your years.

23:01.791 --> 23:02.874
Yeah.

23:03.041 --> 23:05.707
Give me a feeling of imperiousness.

23:05.750 --> 23:10.832
- And you could lean on it.
- I could lean on it! Reflectively.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.457
Point things out.

23:13.666 --> 23:15.624
Club someone to death with it.

23:15.833 --> 23:19.332
A blunt instrument, yeah. Who, though?

23:19.875 --> 23:23.415
That young man from Dublin.

23:26.250 --> 23:29.207
Are all instruments blunt?

23:30.458 --> 23:32.624
Flutes and horns?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.790
Who's this now?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.665
It's my daughter, Fiona.

23:41.875 --> 23:46.915
Right! Like a French novel or something.
What was the fellow's name? Bernanos.

23:47.083 --> 23:51.374
Michael Fitzgerald.
I've bought the big house up the road.

23:51.583 --> 23:54.790
- Haven't seen you at mass recently.
- I've been too busy.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.832
Thinking of getting a chapel built on
the grounds. Like Brideshead Revisited.

23:58.875 --> 24:02.124
Then you could pop in freelance
and save me the trouble.

24:02.833 --> 24:07.332
- Lovely creature.
- Really expensive too. Prime horsemeat.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.349
- Interesting man, your father.
- Is that right?

24:10.416 --> 24:14.582
A good man. A fine man. Nobody around
here has a bad word to say about him.

24:14.625 --> 24:18.249
- Makes you wonder what he's hiding.
- God, you're a fucking prick!

24:18.416 --> 24:19.874
- Oh, feisty!
- Fiona...

24:20.041 --> 24:22.332
I'm kidding. No offence meant,
as they say.

24:22.541 --> 24:27.290
Do me a favor, Father. Swing by the
house one afternoon. I've a proposition.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.249
- Really?
- Yes, really.

24:29.416 --> 24:32.374
A financial proposition.
That interests you, doesn't it?

24:32.541 --> 24:36.790
It would be a black day when the
Church is no longer interested in money.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.540
Huh?

24:41.458 --> 24:42.915
Inspector Stanton.

24:43.083 --> 24:47.790
The clergy at this time of the night.
We could be getting off to a wild start.

24:49.833 --> 24:53.207
Well, hey Father! What do you hear?
What do you say?

24:53.316 --> 24:55.582
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you had company.

24:55.791 --> 24:59.290
Sure. It's only Little Leo.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.040
Are you checking out my ass, Father?

25:05.250 --> 25:06.582
Huh? No.

25:06.625 --> 25:10.165
He's only messing with you, Father.
What can I do for you?

25:11.875 --> 25:14.290
There's nothing to hide from Leo.
Right, Leo?

25:14.458 --> 25:18.082
He likes an open book, Jerry.
Like your ass.

25:19.625 --> 25:22.082
Is this a police matter, Father?

25:22.500 --> 25:25.332
No, it's a personal... a personal thing.

25:25.541 --> 25:28.290
It's a personal... personal thing.

25:28.458 --> 25:32.124
You look worried, Father.
My advice: take it on the lamster.

25:32.166 --> 25:35.007
You don't want to drop in for
the phonus bolonus...

25:35.032 --> 25:37.332
and wind up with a shock
in the kisser. Get me?

25:37.416 --> 25:41.540
- He's not in the mood, Leo.
- Maybe I can cheer up the old sourpuss.

25:41.708 --> 25:45.707
I'll show you a good time, Father.
Good Time Leo, that's me.

25:45.875 --> 25:48.249
Although it will be extra
if I let you wear that cassock.

25:48.416 --> 25:52.824
I know what you holy rollers are like
when you're getting golden hairs.

25:56.375 --> 25:57.965
I'm out of here.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.707
He's a character, huh?

26:09.875 --> 26:12.749
What's troubling you, Father?
You seem agitated.

26:13.125 --> 26:15.415
I need a favor.

26:15.458 --> 26:17.582
My great grandfather's.

26:18.541 --> 26:21.132
Said he took it off
one of the Cairo Gang...

26:21.157 --> 26:23.357
when he shot them all on Bloody Sunday.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.990
The first Bloody Sunday, obviously.

26:28.833 --> 26:33.290
- Ever had call to use it?
- Yeah.

26:33.458 --> 26:36.815
I killed a man once
in the Wicklow Mountains.

26:38.041 --> 26:40.707
What case was that?

26:40.750 --> 26:43.415
Now you're just pissing me off.

26:47.666 --> 26:52.540
Somebody been threatening you, Father?
What have you been up to now?

26:53.916 --> 26:56.832
If not you, who else?

27:02.083 --> 27:05.290
- What did you say you wanted it for?
- I didn't say.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.415
I'd say you wanted it for your dog.

27:08.541 --> 27:11.082
The dog's dying. It's in pain.

27:11.291 --> 27:15.165
You're worried you might have to put it
out of its misery one of these days.

27:15.333 --> 27:16.924
My dog's dying. It's in pain.

27:17.033 --> 27:20.415
I'm worried I might have to put it
out of its misery one of these days.

27:20.483 --> 27:25.790
Compassionate, huh? Well I can't argue
with that. I'm compassionate myself.

27:26.066 --> 27:28.582
Already had one of those,
you know. Early on.

27:28.791 --> 27:31.124
- One of what?
- Pedophile priest.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.374
Twenty years ago. This was in Dublin.

27:33.541 --> 27:35.832
Young girl made a complaint. A rape.

27:35.841 --> 27:37.865
- What happened?
- What do you think?

27:37.975 --> 27:39.324
I arrested the bastard,

27:39.366 --> 27:42.665
and 48 hours later I was packing
my bags and making my way out West.

27:42.833 --> 27:45.707
- You moved out?
- Reassigned, yeah.

27:46.458 --> 27:47.665
What happened to him?

27:47.675 --> 27:51.407
I was told they were sending him
to one of the missions overseas: Africa.

27:51.450 --> 27:54.374
He could do whatever
he wanted over there, I suppose.

27:54.916 --> 27:58.082
- Thanks, anyway.
- Like the man says, Father.

27:58.250 --> 28:00.582
Protect yourself!

28:51.666 --> 28:54.290
How long have you been in this crap?

28:54.583 --> 28:56.665
A couple of years.

28:57.333 --> 28:59.790
Supposed to be therapeutic.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.049
- Maybe I should take it up.
- Maybe you should.

29:03.100 --> 29:04.982
Are you seeing someone in London?

29:05.025 --> 29:07.207
Do you mean professionally,
rather than...

29:07.416 --> 29:09.249
Let's just stop all this...

29:09.291 --> 29:11.974
If you can't talk to me
you should talk to someone.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.765
I suppose I should.

29:15.908 --> 29:17.415
Enjoying yourself?

29:18.625 --> 29:20.107
Yeah, we are, yeah.

29:21.500 --> 29:22.865
Lovely day!

29:23.333 --> 29:25.165
Yes indeed, yeah.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.324
Stamps!

29:32.750 --> 29:35.290
That's the feature of the priesthood?

29:48.333 --> 29:49.832
Milo.

29:49.941 --> 29:51.665
I need to speak to you, Father.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.665
Take a pew, literally.

30:00.875 --> 30:03.582
Why do people kill themselves, Father?

30:03.833 --> 30:08.540
Why do people kill themselves?
That's jumping in the deep end.

30:08.708 --> 30:12.457
Lots of reasons, I suppose.
Why do you think yourself?

30:12.666 --> 30:18.349
I don't know. The drink, depression...
Lack of sex, maybe.

30:18.416 --> 30:22.165
You're a presentable man. I wouldn't
have thought you'd have trouble there.

30:22.375 --> 30:25.124
I don't have the gift of the gab.
Never had it.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.249
That's making you feel suicidal?

30:27.416 --> 30:31.665
More bored than anything else. It's
either suicide or joining the army.

30:32.291 --> 30:35.749
- Those are drastic choices.
- You can learn a trade if you join.

30:35.791 --> 30:37.832
You can learn a trade if you don't.

30:37.958 --> 30:39.490
You can experience more of life.

30:39.500 --> 30:43.432
You think you can become a more
authentic person by fighting in a war?

30:43.500 --> 30:44.574
By killing people.

30:44.641 --> 30:46.707
You're against me joining
is what I'm sensing.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.274
Let's put it this way:

30:48.383 --> 30:51.807
I've always felt there's something
inherently psychopathic...

30:51.832 --> 30:54.332
about someone who joins
the army in peacetime.

30:54.416 --> 30:56.990
As far as I'm concerned
people join the army...

30:57.015 --> 31:00.015
because they want to find out
what it's like to kill someone.

31:00.241 --> 31:04.624
I hardly think that's an inclination
that should be encouraged, do you?

31:06.041 --> 31:08.957
Jesus Christ didn't think so either.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.457
And the Commandment
"thou shalt not kill"...

31:11.482 --> 31:14.778
does not have an asterisk beside it,

31:15.500 --> 31:20.415
referring you to the bottom of the page,
with instances where it's OK to kill.

31:20.625 --> 31:22.707
What about self-defense?

31:25.375 --> 31:28.165
It's a tricky one, all right.

31:28.241 --> 31:30.324
We're hardly being
invaded, though, are we?

31:30.333 --> 31:32.457
The war on terror has no borders.

31:32.583 --> 31:36.957
I don't think we're high on Al Qaeda's
agenda, Milo, do you?

31:37.125 --> 31:39.582
Who knows what goes on
in the Muslim mind?

31:40.333 --> 31:43.374
I have had murderous feelings,
though, I have to admit.

31:44.208 --> 31:48.832
Not getting laid. It's starting to make
me feel really angry towards women.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.540
And so I thought,
well, if I join the Army...

31:51.608 --> 31:54.749
those inclinations, as you call them,
would be seen as a plus.

31:54.916 --> 31:58.957
On the application, they don't come out
and say that's what they're looking for.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.649
In the ads they tell about seeing
the world and all that shite.

32:01.716 --> 32:05.607
But I would assume wanting to murder
someone would be like having a degree.

32:05.775 --> 32:09.006
It would outweigh
my lack of qualifications.

32:09.916 --> 32:12.207
Right.

32:13.950 --> 32:15.265
Do you use pornography?

32:15.375 --> 32:18.040
I feel I've exhausted
all the possibilities of pornography.

32:18.208 --> 32:19.665
All of them?

32:19.733 --> 32:23.124
Nearly all of them. I'm on to
transsexual pornography at the moment.

32:24.125 --> 32:25.957
Chicks with dicks, you know?

32:29.166 --> 32:31.874
Maybe there's a simpler solution.

32:32.041 --> 32:35.999
Leave home. Go somewhere where your
chances of meeting available women...

32:36.166 --> 32:39.540
with loose morals
are increased proportionally.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.749
Should I go to town, you mean?

32:42.375 --> 32:47.207
No, I was thinking more
Dublin, London, New York?

32:47.375 --> 32:50.982
New York? I might
end up getting the AIDS.

32:51.075 --> 32:54.057
Thanks for taking the
time to talk to me, Father.

32:54.125 --> 32:56.140
I can't say it's been much help.

32:56.150 --> 32:58.690
But it's good to get these
things out in the open, I suppose.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.349
Puck!

33:21.404 --> 33:22.464
Puck!

33:41.625 --> 33:45.832
They've all left me, you know.
That's why the place is so empty.

33:46.708 --> 33:48.624
Like a tomb.

33:48.791 --> 33:50.415
Who's left you?

33:51.041 --> 33:52.749
The wife, the kids.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.665
Even Consuela. And she's from Ecuador.

33:55.875 --> 33:59.790
So you'd think she wouldn't have that
many options. But apparently not.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.332
Sorry to hear that.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.790
You mentioned a financial proposition.

34:07.083 --> 34:12.498
I'd like to make amends.
Do penance for past sins.

34:12.875 --> 34:17.956
Although, I suppose all sins are past.
Otherwise they wouldn't be sins.

34:18.125 --> 34:23.998
They'd just be... evil thoughts.
Floating around in your mind.

34:27.041 --> 34:29.831
Why do you wear
the old soutane, by the way?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.248
Are you trying to make a statement?

34:32.458 --> 34:37.364
I mean, look. This watch, here.
That's making a statement. A TAG Heuer.

34:37.533 --> 34:41.532
Are you going to get to the point, Mr.
Fitzgerald? Or are you going to ramble?

34:41.600 --> 34:45.790
Let me ask you a question:
What do you see when you look at me?

34:47.791 --> 34:49.665
I'll tell you what you see.

34:49.875 --> 34:52.331
You see a handsome, sophisticated,

34:52.541 --> 34:55.456
eminent man in the prime of his life.

34:55.666 --> 35:01.207
A colossus, let's say. Who once
bestrode the world of high finance...

35:02.333 --> 35:06.663
and became profoundly
influential in certain spheres.

35:06.688 --> 35:11.944
I'm not saying inordinately.
I'm saying significantly. Let's face it.

35:13.666 --> 35:15.832
Are you sure I can't tempt you?

35:16.041 --> 35:17.415
I'll stick to the water.

35:17.625 --> 35:19.499
I heard you like to drink.

35:19.708 --> 35:21.749
I like it too much.

35:22.125 --> 35:24.582
There's no such thing as too much.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.165
There's only not enough!

35:29.916 --> 35:31.707
Where was I?

35:31.958 --> 35:33.707
Talking about money, what else?

35:33.775 --> 35:35.082
Now, now.

35:35.091 --> 35:38.540
- Got out in time, did you?
- Before it all came crashing down.

35:38.708 --> 35:40.832
It was the perfect getaway, Father.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.040
They say charges are going to be filed
against me, for various irregularities.

35:46.208 --> 35:49.124
But they're always
threatening things like that.

35:49.291 --> 35:53.415
They'd have to charge half the
financiers in Ireland. And the bankers.

35:53.458 --> 35:56.207
And then troop into government
and charge those cunts as well.

35:56.375 --> 35:58.999
And we all know that's
not going to happen.

35:59.291 --> 36:03.915
No, there'll be no punishment
forthcoming for a man such as myself.

36:05.208 --> 36:07.040
There never is.

36:07.875 --> 36:12.165
Still, I feel a... modicum
of guilt about the whole thing.

36:12.458 --> 36:16.290
- A modicum? Do you?
- Well...

36:16.333 --> 36:19.124
I feel like I ought to feel guilty.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.957
I'm sure it's not the same thing.

36:23.166 --> 36:26.624
I love this one. Really expensive.

36:26.875 --> 36:30.040
Not quite sure what it's
supposed to mean, though.

36:30.291 --> 36:32.040
Why does it have to mean anything?

36:32.083 --> 36:35.499
Everything has to mean something.
Otherwise, what's the point?

36:35.566 --> 36:40.374
Of course, I don't have to know what it
means. I own it. That's enough.

36:40.541 --> 36:44.082
That's all that matters?
Ownership? Possession?

36:44.150 --> 36:47.249
How much land does the Church own?
How much gold?

36:47.375 --> 36:49.274
That's the Church. It's not me.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.332
You are a representative
of the Church, are you not?

36:52.500 --> 36:54.599
- If you say so.
- I do say so, yeah.

36:54.666 --> 36:57.040
I think you're a very
judgmental man, father.

36:57.208 --> 36:59.174
Yes I am. But I try not to be.

36:59.241 --> 37:02.332
You think I don't have feelings?
You think I don't care about...

37:02.500 --> 37:04.364
I think you don't want to
do penance at all!

37:04.458 --> 37:06.632
I think you asked me here
to make fun of me.

37:07.375 --> 37:12.582
When you want to do penance sincerely,
you can give me a call, at any time,

37:12.750 --> 37:14.915
and I'll try my best to help you!

37:16.916 --> 37:18.857
I could piss on this, you know.

37:20.591 --> 37:23.582
I said I love it, I don't.
It doesn't mean anything to me.

37:23.708 --> 37:26.949
I could take it down right now and piss
on it. Do you want me to do that?

37:27.158 --> 37:30.249
- Why would I want you to do that?
- I don't know.

37:30.416 --> 37:33.915
So I can have some sort of...
spiritual revelation.

37:34.083 --> 37:37.374
Some sort of fucking epiphany, huh?

37:37.583 --> 37:40.415
OK, let's go.

37:46.041 --> 37:48.124
I'll give you an epiphany.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.082
Well, I don't own it.

37:50.750 --> 37:55.832
People like you have pissed on
everything else, I suppose. So why not?

38:16.125 --> 38:19.124
You have your tools done, I see.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.290
Who is it?

38:20.333 --> 38:23.124
French couple. Head on.

38:23.291 --> 38:26.749
She was totally unscathed.
He got fucked.

38:26.958 --> 38:28.624
Wrong side of the road?

38:28.666 --> 38:32.332
The others hit them drunk, of course.

38:32.500 --> 38:36.999
- How many?
- Five, and I'm including the Frenchman.

38:37.041 --> 38:38.790
Dear God!

38:38.958 --> 38:40.874
Marine biologist he was.

38:41.041 --> 38:44.290
That's where I'd like to be...
under the sea.

38:45.250 --> 38:49.290
- Where are the others?
- The morgue. Best place for them.

38:49.833 --> 38:52.415
Every life is sacred, Frank.
For God's sake.

38:52.583 --> 38:56.124
I know. Some are
less sacred than others.

39:07.591 --> 39:10.282
Through this holy anointing may
the Lord in his love and mercy...

39:10.291 --> 39:11.790
help you...

39:12.000 --> 39:14.624
with the grace of the Holy Spirit.

39:14.791 --> 39:16.665
Amen.

39:23.916 --> 39:29.082
May the Lord who frees you from
sin save you... and raise you up.

39:29.291 --> 39:30.957
Amen.

39:36.958 --> 39:40.124
Have you performed
the last rites many times?

39:40.333 --> 39:44.957
Yes. Usually with
older people, of course.

39:46.833 --> 39:49.165
They have time to prepare for it.

39:50.875 --> 39:53.207
Everybody knows it's coming.

39:55.041 --> 39:57.582
It is easier?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.165
It's never easy.

40:00.875 --> 40:03.165
More understandable, I'd say.

40:04.375 --> 40:06.165
Less unfair.

40:06.833 --> 40:09.124
In situations like this one,

40:09.958 --> 40:12.207
people are shocked.

40:12.375 --> 40:14.749
The randomness of it.

40:16.166 --> 40:20.082
They curse God.
They curse their fellow man.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.832
They lose their faith in some cases.

40:24.708 --> 40:27.332
They lose their faith?

40:29.125 --> 40:31.965
It must not have been
much of a faith to begin with.

40:31.990 --> 40:34.490
If it is so easy for them to lose it.

40:34.875 --> 40:38.040
Yes, but what is faith...

40:38.208 --> 40:42.040
for most people is the fear of death.
It's nothing more than that.

40:43.708 --> 40:46.665
If that's all it is,
it's very easy to lose.

40:48.250 --> 40:50.415
He was a good man, your husband?

40:53.250 --> 40:55.332
Yes.

40:57.791 --> 41:00.165
He was a good man.

41:02.875 --> 41:07.082
We had a very good life together.
We loved each other very much.

41:08.291 --> 41:10.457
And now...

41:11.166 --> 41:13.290
he has gone.

41:14.958 --> 41:17.915
And that is not unfair.

41:19.041 --> 41:21.999
That is just what happened.

41:25.291 --> 41:29.957
But many people don't live good lives.

41:33.166 --> 41:35.874
They don't feel love.

41:38.291 --> 41:40.624
That is why it's unfair.

41:42.916 --> 41:45.082
I feel sorry for them.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.957
Will you say a prayer with me, Theresa?

41:55.583 --> 41:59.249
Hail Mary, full of Grace,
the Lord is with Thee.

41:59.458 --> 42:04.790
Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

42:05.291 --> 42:08.540
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now,

42:08.791 --> 42:12.249
and at the hour of death. Amen.

42:24.541 --> 42:27.207
Finished with all your gobbledygook?

42:29.375 --> 42:31.415
How's she holding up?

42:32.583 --> 42:35.874
- She's a strong woman.
- Good-looking too!

42:36.000 --> 42:37.832
I could be in there.

42:38.041 --> 42:41.832
I've a thing for widowers.
Did I ever tell you?

42:42.833 --> 42:47.457
I think you might have done.
Your material is getting a little stale.

42:47.625 --> 42:51.999
Sure. The atheistic doctor.
It's a clichéd part to play.

42:52.166 --> 42:54.749
There aren't that many good lines.

42:54.916 --> 42:59.957
One part humanism
to nine parts gallows humor.

43:00.333 --> 43:04.624
Playing you, though?
Now, that might be interesting.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.124
Playing me. Who's me?

43:07.333 --> 43:09.207
The good priest.

43:13.666 --> 43:15.790
Excuse me, won't you?

43:16.541 --> 43:18.665
I have to go kill somebody.

43:39.291 --> 43:41.499
How long was I out?

43:42.041 --> 43:44.707
Ages. Eons.

43:44.966 --> 43:47.582
Did I ever tell you the story
about Finn McCool?

43:47.708 --> 43:50.165
And another big strong
lad called Kik Satoin?

43:50.233 --> 43:54.207
- They were at the top of the mountain.
- They were at the top of the mountain.

43:54.375 --> 43:57.665
Kik as a challenge throws a boulder
into the Sea and Iski couldn't do it.

43:57.875 --> 43:59.374
Finn accepted the challenge.

43:59.541 --> 44:01.857
His boulder landed on the shore,

44:01.925 --> 44:05.665
creating such waves that the
sea hasn't been the same since,

44:05.833 --> 44:09.832
which is why the Eastern Coast
is renowned internationally for surfing.

44:10.416 --> 44:13.624
The boulder Finn had thrown
landed here, he drew his sword,

44:13.791 --> 44:15.624
split the rock in two and it said:

44:15.791 --> 44:17.624
If I shoot someone
foolhardy enough...

44:17.691 --> 44:21.540
to pass through the rock three times,
they'll be squished into tiny lumps.

44:21.708 --> 44:23.540
Unceremoniously.

44:24.875 --> 44:29.874
Not a lot of poetry in that recital.
Not a lot of romance.

44:30.083 --> 44:32.332
I'm sick to death of romance.

44:34.625 --> 44:38.374
He was a Japanese writer.
Committed suicide.

44:39.875 --> 44:45.040
He wrote out a list beforehand of all
the famous suicides throughout history.

44:45.333 --> 44:47.624
He included Christ.

44:47.833 --> 44:50.415
Sounds like a smart-ass.

44:50.875 --> 44:54.249
In the Middle Ages they'd just say
I was possessed by demons.

44:54.416 --> 44:56.290
Maybe you were.

44:56.950 --> 44:59.640
Maybe they were nearer
the mark back then.

44:59.708 --> 45:02.499
You think what happened was unimportant.

45:03.416 --> 45:09.332
Insignificant in the great scheme of
things to provoke such a reaction.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.582
But what may...

45:17.000 --> 45:22.165
But what may mean nothing to you
may be very important to me.

45:22.208 --> 45:24.457
I'd never say it was unimportant.

45:26.333 --> 45:29.607
I just say the choices
you make when you're thirty...

45:29.783 --> 45:32.707
are not the same choices
you make when you're sixty.

45:32.958 --> 45:35.165
That's irrelevant.

45:35.375 --> 45:39.832
Every mode of living has
its own logic, its own meaning.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.040
Maybe so.

45:42.375 --> 45:45.507
Maybe you're right there.
I'll have to think about that.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.207
It's a tired old argument, I suppose.

45:53.458 --> 45:56.332
But what about those you leave behind?

45:56.500 --> 45:59.290
They belong to myself,
not to anybody else.

45:59.416 --> 46:01.332
True.

46:03.916 --> 46:06.082
False.

46:06.916 --> 46:10.957
You'll tell me you would have
been in mortal sin, I suppose?

46:15.416 --> 46:18.457
But I have suffered
eternal damnation, Father.

46:23.916 --> 46:25.749
God is great.

46:26.958 --> 46:29.999
The limits of His mercy
have not been set.

46:36.250 --> 46:38.124
Is this where you want to be buried?

46:38.166 --> 46:43.415
Why in hell would I want to be buried in
a God-forsaken place like this?

46:43.625 --> 46:48.999
Where, then? Père-Lachaise?
Next to dear old Oscar?

46:49.166 --> 46:51.915
Next to Apollinaire and Max Ophüls.

46:52.125 --> 46:54.207
Very fancy, I must say.

46:54.250 --> 46:57.182
- I have your gun for you by the way.
- Yeah, right.

46:57.250 --> 47:02.665
I do so! Webley, circa 1920.
Still in good working order, though.

47:02.875 --> 47:05.249
Or so I've been told
by a man who would know.

47:05.458 --> 47:08.749
- Hand it over, then.
- I don't have it on me.

47:08.916 --> 47:11.832
I knew it. Worried I might
follow through with it, huh?

47:11.900 --> 47:14.182
You might take
a pot shot at me, for all I know.

47:14.291 --> 47:18.665
Why would I do that? What have you
ever done to me except talk garbage?

47:18.875 --> 47:20.874
That doesn't mean anything.

47:20.916 --> 47:24.832
Bloody idiots can't even be bothered
with a reason for murder these days.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.332
Come up to a fellow and
it's bang, bang, bang.

47:27.541 --> 47:32.207
I don't know about that.
Some people have very good reasons.

47:37.208 --> 47:39.499
Who are you here to see, Father?

47:39.666 --> 47:40.915
Freddy Joyce.

47:43.041 --> 47:45.915
- Freddy Joyce, the murd...
- I know who he is.

47:46.025 --> 47:48.082
Why the hell do you want to see him for?

47:48.250 --> 47:50.757
He's an old pupil of mine.
He asked to see me.

47:58.291 --> 48:00.624
You know I've asked them to hang me.

48:00.900 --> 48:04.624
There's no capital punishment
in Ireland, Freddy, as you well know.

48:04.666 --> 48:07.932
- Why do you want them to hang you?
- That's the way Leslie Ryan died.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.624
You're saying you feel remorse?

48:09.791 --> 48:12.999
I'm not a monster.
Do I look like a monster?

48:13.875 --> 48:16.249
What do monsters look like?

48:17.041 --> 48:19.749
I had the cops in here the other day.

48:21.208 --> 48:25.624
In third degree.
Wanting to go over all the gory details.

48:25.833 --> 48:29.082
Which I'm sure
you were only too happy to provide.

48:29.291 --> 48:31.790
They're obsessed with cannibalism.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.332
"What did it taste like?"

48:34.875 --> 48:39.082
I told them it tasted like pheasant.
A bit gamy.

48:39.916 --> 48:43.165
Good for you. Make a joke about it.

48:46.416 --> 48:48.457
- Why were they...?
- Same as always.

48:48.500 --> 48:51.738
They want to know who the last one is.
The one they never found.

48:52.463 --> 48:54.071
The one I connected up.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.832
Why can't you tell them, Freddy?

49:02.041 --> 49:04.665
To find some kind of peace.

49:04.833 --> 49:07.749
I wanted to...

49:07.958 --> 49:11.749
Father, for the life of me,
I cannot... remember where I put...

49:12.016 --> 49:14.499
I mean, I know it was
in the woods somewhere.

49:14.541 --> 49:17.999
- Where did I leave my keys?
- No! I wasn't in my right mind.

49:18.875 --> 49:21.665
The LSD... it was like a... fairytale.

49:21.708 --> 49:26.582
You said all that at the trial, Freddy.
It's getting kind of tiresome now.

49:28.791 --> 49:31.165
She was a lovely...

49:33.000 --> 49:35.374
She was a lovely girl.

49:36.416 --> 49:39.374
You know she told me that
she'd been abused before?

49:39.541 --> 49:42.749
So I says: once more won't
make any difference, then.

49:50.708 --> 49:53.624
You see the light
go out in their eyes...

49:54.375 --> 49:57.290
- And you become God!
- No you don't!

50:00.375 --> 50:03.290
No you don't.

50:05.666 --> 50:07.957
Why am I here?

50:10.708 --> 50:12.957
I just wanted someone to talk to.

50:14.916 --> 50:20.457
I don't think you feel any guilt
whatsoever, about anything you've done.

50:20.625 --> 50:23.032
I do. I do, Father.

50:25.958 --> 50:28.540
I believe what the Bible teaches.

50:28.608 --> 50:31.840
I believe that if I repent my sins,
then I'll be forgiven.

50:31.908 --> 50:33.982
And I'll be able to go up to heaven,

50:34.007 --> 50:37.407
and I'll see those girls
and I'll tell them how sorry I am.

50:37.791 --> 50:43.124
I'll hug them and I'll kiss them, and
I'll love them with the real, true love.

50:43.166 --> 50:46.332
I'll have no desire
to hurt them in any way.

50:51.291 --> 50:53.965
God made me, didn't he?

50:56.458 --> 50:58.790
Didn't he?

51:00.125 --> 51:02.957
So he understands me.

51:03.041 --> 51:05.249
He must do.

51:09.666 --> 51:11.999
Don't you think?

51:14.375 --> 51:18.540
I think if God can't
understand you, Freddy...

51:19.541 --> 51:21.015
no one can.

51:30.675 --> 51:32.749
You know they're foreclosing on me?

51:32.916 --> 51:36.332
- Who?
- Who? The banks, who else?

51:36.500 --> 51:38.249
Sorry to hear that.

51:38.291 --> 51:41.174
How come I never hear
your mob preaching about that?

51:41.241 --> 51:42.332
About what?

51:42.416 --> 51:45.740
About all these bankers who
have brought this country to its knees?

51:46.916 --> 51:50.790
Still driving people out of their homes
for not making their payments.

51:51.083 --> 51:54.165
Ever hear your mob talk about that?

51:54.333 --> 51:55.915
Those are things too, aren't they?

51:55.958 --> 51:57.582
Yes, they are.

51:57.750 --> 51:58.824
That's right.

51:59.166 --> 52:03.232
I suppose when you have a history of
screwing the Jews out of their money,

52:03.257 --> 52:05.057
and collaborating with the Nazis.

52:05.125 --> 52:08.415
It's like the pot calling
the kettle black, eh?

52:08.458 --> 52:12.707
I suppose it is. Getting full use out of
your library card there, Brendan.

52:12.875 --> 52:17.874
Library's been shut down.
Did you not hear? Cutbacks.

52:43.041 --> 52:45.082
You're not dancing, Milo.

52:45.250 --> 52:47.374
I don't like this music.

52:47.583 --> 52:49.582
What music do you like?

52:49.791 --> 52:51.707
Dolly Parton.

52:51.916 --> 52:53.790
Dolly Parton's good, yeah.

53:01.708 --> 53:03.249
Great cocaine!

53:04.625 --> 53:06.832
Very moreish!

53:11.708 --> 53:14.124
Totally medicinal, Father.

53:23.458 --> 53:25.282
How was your man, Joyce?

53:26.508 --> 53:29.374
It's been a tough day,
let's put it that way.

53:29.883 --> 53:32.582
How can you hope
to connect with someone like that?

53:32.750 --> 53:35.957
What are you talking about?
Not Freddy Joyce!

53:35.958 --> 53:37.999
I visited him in prison today.

53:38.333 --> 53:39.382
Why?

53:39.391 --> 53:43.415
A prisoner deserves spiritual guidance
as much as anyone else. Maybe more so.

53:43.583 --> 53:47.624
Is that right? So they can find God.

53:47.791 --> 53:51.749
And then say God has absolved
them of all their sins.

53:51.916 --> 53:55.749
And what they did didn't really matter
anyways, 'cause now they're saved!

53:55.791 --> 53:56.999
Something like that, yeah.

53:57.166 --> 54:00.032
Calm down. You don't know
what you're talking about.

54:04.708 --> 54:08.540
Do you mind the drinks?
For Christ's sake!

54:10.875 --> 54:13.665
He had that coming a long time.
You know yourself.

54:25.541 --> 54:27.749
Fine-looking man.

54:27.958 --> 54:29.999
Watch yourself with him.

54:30.291 --> 54:33.290
I gave up cocaine a long time ago.

54:34.333 --> 54:36.457
You took cocaine?

54:36.625 --> 54:38.790
Come on, let's dance.

54:39.625 --> 54:41.999
- No, no.
- How'd they call it in your day, jive?

54:42.125 --> 54:43.957
- No, no.
- Come on!

55:15.541 --> 55:18.999
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

55:19.208 --> 55:22.165
Say one Our Father and ten Hail Mary's.

55:22.458 --> 55:24.749
I've sinned more than that.

55:24.958 --> 55:28.332
Make an ascent to
Croagh Patrick, then. On your knees.

55:28.500 --> 55:32.124
On my knees, is it?
What made you say that?

55:41.000 --> 55:44.624
- Your church is on fire.
- Fuck off Brendan. I'm not in the mood.

55:44.833 --> 55:47.540
You're church is on fire!

55:52.000 --> 55:53.707
Jesus Christ!

55:58.708 --> 56:01.124
I called the fire brigade, Father.

56:01.791 --> 56:03.665
For all the good it'll do.

56:03.833 --> 56:06.624
They'll never get here in time.

56:09.875 --> 56:12.665
- Why didn't anybody see?
- Daddy, stay away.

56:14.250 --> 56:16.415
Daddy! Come away.

56:18.166 --> 56:20.582
Why didn't anybody see?

56:27.250 --> 56:30.249
They're probably
going to blame you for this.

56:36.500 --> 56:39.165
Professional job, I'd say that for them.

56:39.375 --> 56:42.415
Any fool can start a fire,
for fuck's sake.

57:01.875 --> 57:03.457
Who'd do a thing like this?

57:03.500 --> 57:06.374
Somebody with a grudge
against the Church, obviously.

57:06.541 --> 57:08.540
That could be half the country.

57:08.750 --> 57:10.790
Unless it's a personal angle.

57:10.958 --> 57:11.512
How'd you mean?

57:11.523 --> 57:14.790
Nobody had a grudge against your father,
no?

57:16.583 --> 57:18.832
Who'd have a grudge against you?

57:18.875 --> 57:21.374
Maybe this is the future, huh?

57:21.916 --> 57:24.665
Maybe it'll all be ruins one day.

57:24.916 --> 57:29.207
Maybe one day kids will say in
amazement: They used to believe in what?

57:29.416 --> 57:30.953
And all that up in the sky.

57:30.978 --> 57:35.058
And if we're good we'll go to heaven.
And if we're bad we'll go to hell.

57:36.016 --> 57:40.082
You know, for a policeman you seem
to know very little about human nature.

57:40.250 --> 57:43.957
Maybe you're right.
You know more than me.

57:44.750 --> 57:46.624
Don't touch anything now.

57:46.833 --> 57:50.999
Have to get the forensics boys down.
The supercilious pricks!

57:59.500 --> 58:01.915
What do we do now?

58:02.750 --> 58:05.165
We'll have to rebuild it, I suppose.

58:05.458 --> 58:09.374
Maybe use bricks next time.
Might be a good idea.

58:23.458 --> 58:25.832
Oh, God, Father.

58:28.500 --> 58:32.457
Is this about the coke?
I can take it or leave it.

58:32.791 --> 58:34.457
Really?

58:34.625 --> 58:36.999
Yeah. Most people can.

58:37.041 --> 58:40.082
The only ones who can't
have problems to begin with.

58:40.291 --> 58:44.574
We shouldn't write them off, though. The
ones who have problems to begin with.

58:46.991 --> 58:49.624
What do you want
to do with your life, Veronica?

58:52.583 --> 58:54.415
Nothing.

58:54.833 --> 58:57.557
Consider the lilies of the field,
how they grow:

58:57.582 --> 58:59.682
they toil not, neither do they spin.

58:59.958 --> 59:01.915
Very nice quotation.

59:02.125 --> 59:04.207
Sure. Everybody knows that one.

59:04.375 --> 59:05.524
Hackneyed, yeah.

59:05.566 --> 59:09.507
It's like "turn the other cheek".
Or "judge not lest you be judged".

59:11.750 --> 59:13.907
I'd like to be an actress, maybe.

59:14.116 --> 59:16.790
I've an absent father
and domineering mother.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.915
That's a start.

59:19.708 --> 59:21.624
When did your dad leave?

59:21.833 --> 59:24.374
He didn't leave, he was killed.

59:25.416 --> 59:28.290
- Murdered?
- Hunting accident.

59:28.315 --> 59:29.815
Completely random.

59:31.583 --> 59:35.571
So there's no use persevering,
Father. I'm a lost cause.

59:37.958 --> 59:40.665
No one is a lost cause, Veronica.

59:45.583 --> 59:47.749
Who is it?

59:48.916 --> 59:51.040
I don't know who it is.

59:54.083 --> 59:56.165
You said you did.

59:56.375 --> 59:58.582
I've no evidence it's the same man.

59:58.833 --> 01:00:03.874
It's the same man. Takes a lot
of nerve to burn down a church.

01:00:04.666 --> 01:00:09.582
Helps if you have a burning sense
of grievance, if you'll pardon the...

01:00:09.791 --> 01:00:14.124
We have to ask ourselves:
What does this man want?

01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:18.915
He wants to be loved, of course.
We all want to be loved.

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:22.740
Failing that he wants to be... admired.

01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:26.874
Failing that he wants to be feared.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:30.674
Failing that, he wants to be
hated and despised.

01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:33.824
You should beware the man
who wants to be hated and despised.

01:00:33.866 --> 01:00:36.474
Don't you think?

01:00:37.666 --> 01:00:41.665
I think you read that in a book,
your Excellency.

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:48.374
I think he wants to stir up some sort
of feelings in others. That's true.

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:51.915
Doesn't want to be ignored any more.

01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:55.540
Wants to make contact.

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:58.582
He made contact all right.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:02.915
Who is it?

01:01:09.325 --> 01:01:11.065
Dreadful business, I must say.

01:01:11.075 --> 01:01:14.249
Some little blackguard running riot,
I wouldn't wonder.

01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:16.624
What can you do in this day and age?

01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:18.749
True that.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.665
Sorry about the other day, Father.

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:25.040
That was the drink talking.

01:01:25.416 --> 01:01:26.832
What can we do for you?

01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:31.374
It's off the bat with what I was saying.
And it seems more necessary than ever.

01:01:31.541 --> 01:01:33.499
I'd like to make a donation.

01:01:36.708 --> 01:01:38.365
That would be grand.

01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:40.290
To salve your conscience?

01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:44.415
Surely that's in the nature of all
philanthropy. The expiation of guilt.

01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:48.790
I'm sure you've nothing major to
feel guilty about, Mr. Fitzgerald.

01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:53.207
You'd be surprised, Father.
Call me Michael.

01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:59.207
Michael it is. Any charity
is always gratefully received.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:00.582
I know.

01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:03.290
I believe that's Church doctrine.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:07.624
The Church needs all the help
it can get. Especially these days.

01:02:07.733 --> 01:02:08.899
Why would you say that?

01:02:09.008 --> 01:02:12.832
Well, with all the compensation that's
been paid out over the last few years?

01:02:15.575 --> 01:02:18.915
And that's only the Yanks,
we all know they weren't worst.

01:02:18.958 --> 01:02:23.624
I don't know about that. Most of
those cases were 40 or 50 years ago.

01:02:23.833 --> 01:02:26.874
Raking up old ground
it always seemed to me.

01:02:27.166 --> 01:02:30.624
- Time to forgive and forget.
- I agree. I agree.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:34.082
What's past is past.
Time to move on.

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.590
Etcetera, etcetera.

01:02:39.308 --> 01:02:43.082
Would you like a cup of tea,
Michael, or maybe something stronger?

01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:47.457
Do you have any crystal meth?
No, no. I can't stop.

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:51.588
So what are we talking about?
Ten? Twenty?

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:54.582
Twenty thousand?

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:57.707
Twenty thousand Euros, yeah.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.115
Well, that would be grand.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.790
That would help us getting the
initial building work off the ground.

01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:06.415
Twenty it is, then.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.457
This is a David Oscarson pen.

01:03:09.833 --> 01:03:11.832
It's really expensive.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.832
It's lovely.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.999
Why not make it fifty?

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:18.290
Well, Father!

01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:23.499
If money is no object, make it fifty.

01:03:25.416 --> 01:03:28.707
Why not make it a hundred?
It means nothing to me.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.790
I know it doesn't.

01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:36.957
100,000 Euros for your pet project,
Father. What do you say to that?

01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:40.249
I say: Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald.

01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:43.790
What was Stanton getting on?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.290
If I could tell you, I would.
You know that.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.249
I thought I was the one that was
supposed to be in trouble, not you.

01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:54.665
How's the fish.?

01:03:55.041 --> 01:03:56.915
Too many little bones.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.832
Isn't that always the way?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.249
Not stopping.

01:04:01.458 --> 01:04:03.540
Meeting a fellow.

01:04:03.708 --> 01:04:06.415
You're informing me
of your adultery in advance.

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:09.157
Isn't that more honest
than in the confessional?

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:12.215
When it's all done and dusted,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

01:04:12.283 --> 01:04:13.749
What are you expecting him to do?

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:15.924
Stop me from committing a mortal sin.

01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:18.749
You have to stop yourself.
I can't stop you.

01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:21.457
Then what good are you at all?

01:04:21.833 --> 01:04:24.415
There's my ride, as it were.

01:04:25.916 --> 01:04:28.624
Let's do this again, sometime.

01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:39.240
Do you have to put up with
that kind of shit on a regular basis?

01:04:40.533 --> 01:04:43.624
There's a lot of it going around,
let's put it that way.

01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:51.499
We really should talk, you know.
Let it all out.

01:04:53.416 --> 01:04:56.749
Like in one of those
shit plays at the abbey.

01:04:58.291 --> 01:05:02.082
I don't know what the
revelation would be, though.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.249
Neither do I.

01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:10.382
Your mother dying killed a little
something in both of us, I know that.

01:05:11.458 --> 01:05:14.915
It was a long goodbye,
if ever there was one.

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:18.832
Sometimes I wish she hadn't
hanged on as long as she did.

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:21.707
She was stubborn all right.

01:05:21.916 --> 01:05:24.124
Brave too, though.

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:27.249
Wonder if I'll be
as brave when the time comes.

01:05:27.541 --> 01:05:30.249
It wasn't just her dying.

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:34.707
You were missing in action a long time.
Before and after.

01:05:35.375 --> 01:05:37.999
When I needed you most.

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:42.082
I was never neglectful, I don't think.

01:05:43.708 --> 01:05:45.790
Never hit you or anything.

01:05:45.958 --> 01:05:47.874
There are other forms of violence.

01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:51.582
I know there are!
Attempting suicide, for one.

01:05:52.041 --> 01:05:53.765
Jesus! I walked into that one.

01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:55.999
It's not only violence
against yourself, either.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.249
It wasn't intended that way.

01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:00.749
I never meant to hurt you.

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:03.915
How could it not hurt me? I love you!

01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:06.874
I love you too.

01:06:06.916 --> 01:06:09.540
Don't ever doubt that.

01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:16.374
Dad...

01:06:17.416 --> 01:06:20.582
And just when I thought I had you back,

01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:24.790
and you were ship-shape
and rearing to go, go you did.

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:29.957
I thought it would be another woman.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.040
I have a vocation.
I wasn't trying to escape!

01:06:33.066 --> 01:06:35.582
I know that! I know you're sincere.

01:06:37.166 --> 01:06:39.957
But, Dad, the fact remains.

01:06:40.416 --> 01:06:44.999
First Mum went away,
and then you went away.

01:06:46.625 --> 01:06:50.582
I lost two parents for the price of one.

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:55.540
I never ran anywhere. I stayed here.

01:06:55.583 --> 01:06:58.290
I think you're being
a bit naive there, Father.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.374
I'm still here.

01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:02.999
I'll always be here.

01:07:04.916 --> 01:07:07.290
Will you?

01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:10.290
You promise?

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:15.624
I'll always be here.

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:18.707
And you'll always be here.

01:07:31.291 --> 01:07:33.707
How was that for a third act revelation?

01:07:34.416 --> 01:07:36.457
Corny.

01:07:37.125 --> 01:07:39.332
But I like it.

01:07:50.074 --> 01:07:51.467
Here.

01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:02.624
Here's mud in your eye!

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:08.165
Great stuff!

01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:18.249
You know I can tell
when you're really getting old.

01:08:18.916 --> 01:08:20.207
How?

01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:25.790
No one ever says the word
"death" around you anymore.

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:33.140
Bruno! Bruno!

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:54.540
Oh Bruno!

01:08:56.041 --> 01:09:00.290
What has he done to Bruno?

01:09:20.082 --> 01:09:22.915
Oh, I forgot to say goodbye to Bruno!

01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:25.874
- I'll give him a big kiss on you.
- Oh, do!

01:09:25.916 --> 01:09:28.874
- I'll be fine from here.
- Will you?

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.999
Well let's just say today I'm fine.

01:09:33.207 --> 01:09:35.082
So you say.

01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:05.415
Hello! Where are you off to?

01:10:05.583 --> 01:10:06.699
The beach.

01:10:06.866 --> 01:10:09.290
- It's nice at the beach, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:10.707
You surf?

01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:13.957
No, my dad won't let me.
Says it's too dangerous.

01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:18.165
What does he know? The meany!

01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:20.874
You're here on holidays?

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:23.249
- Where are you from? Wicklow!
- Yeah.

01:10:23.416 --> 01:10:25.790
Never mind. I won't hold it against you.

01:10:27.166 --> 01:10:29.582
Jeanine! Get in the car.

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.790
What were you saying to her?

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.832
- I wasn't saying anything to her.
- Oh, really?

01:10:34.875 --> 01:10:37.249
It looked like a
fucking conversation to me.

01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:43.124
Where the hell did you get to, honey?

01:10:43.166 --> 01:10:45.182
I've been looking all over for you.

01:10:57.541 --> 01:10:59.749
Large one.

01:11:01.541 --> 01:11:03.040
You sure about that?

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:05.082
Whiskey, I said.

01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:13.249
Who burnt down your church, Father?
If you don't mind me asking.

01:11:13.416 --> 01:11:17.415
It's not my church. It's our church.

01:11:17.458 --> 01:11:19.624
I'd say it was the Romanians.

01:11:19.791 --> 01:11:23.707
They're awful heathens.
The Romanians.

01:11:23.891 --> 01:11:25.932
What Romanians do we have around here?

01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:30.915
They're always hanging around.
Romanians. Getting up to no good.

01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:34.165
Must be someone who
doesn't like you, Father.

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:37.415
I think it must be one of the
good people in this town.

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:42.499
You should join the Garda, Simon.
With your "powers of deduction".

01:11:53.916 --> 01:11:58.707
These measures, huh, Father?
Like a buttercup in the mouth of a cow.

01:12:00.208 --> 01:12:02.624
Pint there, please, Brendan.

01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:08.582
So you're sure there's
a God then, Father, yeah?

01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:16.707
I'm not kidding.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:21.707
I'm being serious. I'm asking
because I'm having doubts myself.

01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:24.774
I'm having a crisis of faith.

01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.165
Don't be getting offended.

01:12:30.416 --> 01:12:34.999
Fa... I'm sorry! Really I am!

01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:40.790
As sure as a hole in the ground...
Don't be going away mad!

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.082
I'm an awful messer.

01:12:50.875 --> 01:12:53.665
Hey, Father! What do you hear?
What do you say?

01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:55.332
You're back, so?

01:12:55.375 --> 01:12:59.999
I've got a lot of clients in this town.
From the Hoi polloi to the masses.

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:03.790
I've got to keep my
ass lubricated at all times.

01:13:04.916 --> 01:13:09.790
Hoi polloi are the masses of society.
You're using the phrase incorrectly.

01:13:09.958 --> 01:13:13.257
You know that maybe so, Father.
I didn't get no education, see?

01:13:13.325 --> 01:13:16.557
I was getting fucked in the ass
and fucked in the face all day.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:19.290
Wasn't no time for any of that.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:24.207
I was sucking the prick of
a bishop on a regular basis, you get me?

01:13:24.708 --> 01:13:27.665
How did you like that play, smart ass?

01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:29.665
You need help.

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:32.107
You're starting to sound
a little screwy.

01:13:32.132 --> 01:13:34.732
Maybe you need to see
a head-shrinker yourself.

01:13:35.416 --> 01:13:37.040
Do you need help? Are you OK?

01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:39.207
Hey! Father...

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:43.165
There's nothing wrong
with me, Father. All right?

01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:47.707
I'm feeling fine.

01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:58.415
You know...

01:13:58.875 --> 01:14:04.857
when I first started out working up in
Dublin, there was this 3-year-old boy.

01:14:07.041 --> 01:14:11.957
Parents brought him into the hospital.
A routine operation.

01:14:12.166 --> 01:14:16.165
But the anesthetist made a mistake.

01:14:17.175 --> 01:14:23.117
Little boy ended up deaf, dumb, blind...

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.165
and paralyzed. For good.

01:14:31.083 --> 01:14:33.707
Think of it!

01:14:33.916 --> 01:14:37.374
Think when that little boy
first regained consciousness.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.374
In the dark. You'd be
frightened, wouldn’t you?

01:14:43.166 --> 01:14:49.065
You'd be frightened in the kind of a way
that you know the fear is going to end.

01:14:50.375 --> 01:14:52.915
Has to.

01:14:53.458 --> 01:14:58.124
Must. Your parents
couldn't be too far away.

01:14:58.375 --> 01:15:01.124
They'll come to your rescue.

01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:05.499
They'll turn the light on.
They'll talk to you.

01:15:06.541 --> 01:15:09.374
But... think of it.

01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:15.832
Nobody comes to rescue you.
No light is turned on.

01:15:16.875 --> 01:15:19.198
You are in the dark.

01:15:19.859 --> 01:15:23.548
You try to speak... but you can't.

01:15:24.416 --> 01:15:29.374
You try to move... but you can't.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:35.332
You try to cry out. But you are
unable to hear your own screams.

01:15:36.625 --> 01:15:40.124
You are entombed within your own body.

01:15:41.083 --> 01:15:44.032
Howling with terror.

01:15:53.541 --> 01:15:56.332
What the fuck?

01:15:56.708 --> 01:16:00.665
Why the fuck would
you tell me a story like that?

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.832
No reason.

01:16:13.083 --> 01:16:16.165
Some people are awfully touchy.

01:16:17.416 --> 01:16:19.332
Good luck!

01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:09.957
Time to go. Come on.

01:17:10.666 --> 01:17:13.790
You're still drinking.
Same again.

01:17:13.833 --> 01:17:15.915
Time to go, I said.

01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:18.707
Is that an order?

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:21.707
You don't like taking orders, Father?

01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:23.790
You do not mind giving them.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.082
These kinds are all alike.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:30.582
- My "kind".
- Yeah, your "kind".

01:17:31.125 --> 01:17:33.749
Your time is gone and you
don't even fucking realize it.

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:35.582
My time will never be gone.

01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:38.999
Did you hear that?
The arrogance of the man.

01:17:39.166 --> 01:17:41.190
You need to be a little more humble.

01:17:41.258 --> 01:17:44.499
Needs to be taken down a peg or two.
That's what he needs.

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.540
Take me down, then.

01:17:53.958 --> 01:17:57.457
Go on, I fucking dare you.

01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:34.832
Jesus Christ!

01:18:34.958 --> 01:18:37.665
- What happened to you?
- Brendan Lynch.

01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:39.949
Brendan Lynch? He's a Buddhist!

01:18:40.058 --> 01:18:44.132
So what if he's a fucking Buddhist? You
think Buddhists don't beat people up?

01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:47.290
You think Buddhists don't
fuck their kids like everyone else?

01:18:47.458 --> 01:18:48.782
You're obviously very upset!

01:18:48.833 --> 01:18:52.832
Tibetans spit on blind people in the
street! Their killing albinos in Africa!

01:18:53.041 --> 01:18:54.665
You're so fucking naive.

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:56.457
Please don't curse at me, Father.

01:18:56.666 --> 01:19:00.657
I think It would be best to continue
this conversation in the morning, sober.

01:19:00.666 --> 01:19:03.165
Why are you a fucking priest at all?

01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:07.957
You should be a fucking accountant!
Or a fucking insurance man!

01:19:22.541 --> 01:19:25.040
Terrible!

01:19:27.416 --> 01:19:29.332
Let's go home.

01:19:30.958 --> 01:19:32.332
What is it?

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.207
Nothing.

01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:56.707
You're leaving?

01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:01.832
I think it's for the best.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.665
Because of last night?

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:06.415
Because of a lot of things.

01:20:06.583 --> 01:20:09.915
Not just last night.
Or what's happened here.

01:20:12.466 --> 01:20:14.749
I've been having doubts,
if you must know.

01:20:15.083 --> 01:20:17.915
Listen, I'm sorry
about what I said last night.

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:22.540
You said what you said with such venom!
I didn't realize you hated me that much.

01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:24.665
I don't hate you at all.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.915
Then, why?

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:29.149
It's just you have no integrity!

01:20:29.174 --> 01:20:31.474
That's the worse
I can say about anybody.

01:20:33.958 --> 01:20:36.040
Well, that's...

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:40.915
- That's just...
- Hope you find what you're looking for.

01:20:41.833 --> 01:20:43.915
Good luck.

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:49.582
Father?

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:51.290
Hello.

01:21:53.958 --> 01:21:56.290
You're going to Dublin?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.749
Yeah.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:03.582
Just getting away for a while, you know?

01:22:05.625 --> 01:22:09.415
I heard about your church.
Terrible thing.

01:22:10.375 --> 01:22:11.999
Yes.

01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:14.290
You must be very upset.

01:22:19.208 --> 01:22:21.332
Yes, I am.

01:22:28.416 --> 01:22:32.415
I'm bringing him home.
To his family in Italy.

01:22:34.666 --> 01:22:38.332
Dublin and then... Rome.

01:22:40.333 --> 01:22:41.790
How have you been?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.957
People here have been very kind to me.

01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:48.832
I mean...

01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:56.040
You know, sometimes
I think I cannot go on.

01:22:57.416 --> 01:22:59.207
But...

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:02.999
I will go on.

01:25:32.875 --> 01:25:34.707
Father!

01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:36.832
Little early for mass.

01:25:36.875 --> 01:25:42.824
Dr. Hart was out fishing at the crack of
dawn. He begrudgingly gave me a ride.

01:25:43.166 --> 01:25:45.207
Where are you headed?

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:47.790
Just down the beach there.

01:25:47.916 --> 01:25:52.124
- Can I come along?
- Not really, no. Maybe later.

01:25:52.291 --> 01:25:55.499
That's fine, yeah.
I won't keep you.

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:57.624
Did you finish your book?

01:25:57.666 --> 01:26:00.749
Yes, I did. I don't know how good it is.

01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:05.124
I'm sure it'll be extraordinary.
You're a very fine writer.

01:26:07.041 --> 01:26:09.332
Thank you, James!

01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:15.540
<i>You know you changed the subject
the other day when we were talking.</i>

01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:17.207
What was the subject?

01:26:17.416 --> 01:26:22.349
You know what the subject was. I think
you committed a sin of omission.

01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:25.832
I'm sure there are worse
sins than sins of omission.

01:26:26.041 --> 01:26:28.832
I'll let you be the expert
in that department, father.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.082
I think there's too much
talk about sins, to be honest.

01:26:32.625 --> 01:26:35.290
Not enough talk about virtues.

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:37.707
You might be right.

01:26:39.083 --> 01:26:41.415
What would be your number one?

01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:44.665
I think forgiveness
has been highly underrated.

01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:49.665
I forgive you.

01:26:50.958 --> 01:26:52.915
Do you forgive me?

01:26:54.041 --> 01:26:56.124
Always.

01:27:16.916 --> 01:27:20.957
Thinking of throwing yourself in?
They say that's the easy way out.

01:27:21.166 --> 01:27:24.124
Nothing easy about it,
I wouldn't have thought.

01:27:28.083 --> 01:27:30.540
I'm in a bad way, Father.

01:27:33.041 --> 01:27:35.624
No, I'm not putting you on.

01:27:36.583 --> 01:27:39.749
The truth is I've been
in a bad way for...

01:27:40.708 --> 01:27:42.957
a long time.

01:27:43.541 --> 01:27:46.165
No will to do anything.

01:27:46.958 --> 01:27:50.374
Feeling of nothing being worthwhile...

01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:54.749
A sense of disassociation.

01:27:55.916 --> 01:27:58.082
Detachment.

01:27:58.291 --> 01:28:00.415
I had a wife and kids,

01:28:01.291 --> 01:28:03.415
they meant nothing to me.

01:28:07.458 --> 01:28:10.749
I have money. It means nothing to me.

01:28:12.333 --> 01:28:14.665
I have life...

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.749
and it means nothing to me.

01:28:23.416 --> 01:28:27.874
Where do you think it comes from?
The sense of detachment.

01:28:31.916 --> 01:28:33.525
From nowhere.

01:28:37.112 --> 01:28:38.714
From nowhere.

01:28:45.458 --> 01:28:48.332
Listen, I have to meet someone now.

01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:51.249
I'll call on you after.

01:28:52.666 --> 01:28:54.707
We'll talk.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.999
Get you back on track. OK?

01:29:05.166 --> 01:29:07.999
- OK?
- Thank you.

01:29:09.375 --> 01:29:11.457
Thank you, Father.

01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:12.957
Thank you.

01:29:16.416 --> 01:29:18.665
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:17.957
Take your hands out
of your pockets. Slowly.

01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:19.624
Why?

01:30:19.691 --> 01:30:21.740
I heard you had a gun.

01:30:25.666 --> 01:30:29.457
I have to say I'm surprised.
Thought I'd have to go looking for you.

01:30:29.525 --> 01:30:32.374
Just 'cause I'm here doesn't
mean you have to go through with it.

01:30:32.541 --> 01:30:34.207
Yes it does!

01:30:35.458 --> 01:30:38.249
It's one of those
cell phone selling properties.

01:30:39.416 --> 01:30:42.457
Did you ever think it would
come to this, though, huh?

01:30:42.666 --> 01:30:46.082
I was hoping it wouldn't.
I thought you were a friend of mine.

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:49.374
Your friend is just
an enemy you haven't made yet.

01:30:49.541 --> 01:30:53.290
- Cheap cynicism.
- Not cheap, now, no.

01:30:54.083 --> 01:30:56.874
It's a cynicism that's been hard won!

01:30:57.375 --> 01:30:59.432
It's a cynicism that's been earned...

01:30:59.457 --> 01:31:02.857
over a hell of a lot of
physical and psychological torture.

01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:07.815
I take it back then.
But it's cynicism none the less.

01:31:08.733 --> 01:31:10.949
Maybe that's the difference between us.

01:31:11.291 --> 01:31:13.332
Oh, that's not the only difference.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.124
Any regrets?

01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:19.749
Oh, yeah! Never
got to finish "Moby Dick".

01:31:19.858 --> 01:31:22.040
- The whale kills Ahab.
- Is that right?

01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:25.832
Then he destroys the rest of
the ship and the crew along with it.

01:31:26.083 --> 01:31:27.892
All except for Ishmael.

01:31:28.973 --> 01:31:30.917
He alone escapes. To tell thee.

01:31:35.791 --> 01:31:39.415
The burning of the church
I can understand.

01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:43.349
You didn't have to kill my dog.

01:31:43.658 --> 01:31:47.540
I didn't kill your dog! I love dogs.
Why would I do a thing like that?

01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:49.532
I found him with his throat cut.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.582
Why would I fucking kill a dog?
I didn't...

01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:55.707
That had nothing to do with me.

01:31:55.958 --> 01:31:58.332
I'm wholly innocent of that crime.

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:05.915
I did give Veronica a bit
of a shove that one time, though.

01:32:06.083 --> 01:32:09.082
I do admit that and I'm sorry for it.

01:32:13.833 --> 01:32:16.207
Did it upset you, the dog?

01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:17.957
Yes, it did.

01:32:18.125 --> 01:32:19.582
Did you cry?

01:32:19.791 --> 01:32:20.915
Yes, I did.

01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:23.040
That's nice.

01:32:25.583 --> 01:32:29.832
And when you read what your fellow
priests did to all those poor children,

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.999
all those years, did you cry then?

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:38.749
I asked you a question:
Did you cry then?

01:32:39.666 --> 01:32:41.290
No.

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.415
That's right!

01:32:45.458 --> 01:32:47.790
- I suppose...
- What?

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.290
- I suppose I felt attachment.
- Yeah.

01:32:53.358 --> 01:32:54.957
- When you read...
- Yeah, yeah.

01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:56.824
Something in a newspaper...

01:33:03.791 --> 01:33:06.249
Detach yourself from that!

01:33:09.875 --> 01:33:12.499
We were the lucky ones!

01:33:12.708 --> 01:33:17.165
There's bodies burning back there!
Burning like dogs!

01:33:21.375 --> 01:33:24.040
Don't look at me.

01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:27.249
Turn your face away, don't look at me!

01:33:31.041 --> 01:33:33.707
No! Run! Mícheál, run!

01:33:33.916 --> 01:33:36.207
I'll get Stanton, Father!

01:33:40.125 --> 01:33:42.832
He reminds me of me.

01:33:48.083 --> 01:33:50.540
It's not too late, Jack.

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:53.707
Yes, it is.

01:33:55.875 --> 01:33:58.332
Yes it is.

01:33:59.916 --> 01:34:02.499
Say your prayers, Father.

01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:06.124
I've already said them.
