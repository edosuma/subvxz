00:02.085 --> 00:05.046
Hal, you've been out here

00:02.085 --> 00:05.046
for six hours.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.757
That's all you're

00:05.088 --> 00:06.757
throwing away?

00:06.799 --> 00:08.467
No. This is my "maybe" pile.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.052
Look, I want to able to fit

00:08.509 --> 00:11.052
the van in the garage.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.054
That's the whole point

00:11.094 --> 00:13.054
of having a garage!

00:13.096 --> 00:15.349
You don't realize

00:13.096 --> 00:15.349
how complicated this is.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.351
Hal.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.351
Lois, I promise you.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.478
The van will fit

00:17.392 --> 00:19.478
in the garage!

00:36.203 --> 00:39.581
I think you owe

00:36.203 --> 00:39.581
me an apology.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.329
Francis is home visiting

01:17.160 --> 01:19.329
with his wife, Piama.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.581
It's been so nice around here

01:19.371 --> 01:20.581
since they came.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.791
Good dinner, Mom.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.209
Please. It's completely

01:22.833 --> 01:24.209
overcooked.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.378
You must really be hurting

01:24.251 --> 01:26.378
for some decent cooking.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.132
See? Mom's so busy

01:28.964 --> 01:31.132
being mean to Piama,

01:31.174 --> 01:32.843
she doesn't even notice us.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.136
We've been getting away

01:32.885 --> 01:35.136
with murder.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.137
(phone rings)

01:36.179 --> 01:37.806
Hello?

01:37.848 --> 01:39.808
Uh, hi, Claire.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.977
(whispering):

01:39.850 --> 01:41.977
It's my sister!

01:39.850 --> 01:41.977
Oh, God.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.144
I'm gonna hang up on her.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.022
No, Hal. Find out

01:43.186 --> 01:45.022
what she wants.

01:45.064 --> 01:47.066
So what's up?

01:47.106 --> 01:48.442
Uh-huh.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.402
Family reunion this weekend

01:48.483 --> 01:50.402
for my Dad's birthday.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.863
I'm sorry, Claire,

01:50.444 --> 01:52.863
but I'm having foot surgery,

01:52.905 --> 01:54.239
so we'll have to pass.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.242
No, Hal, it's been too long

01:54.281 --> 01:57.242
already, we should go.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.744
But you know what,

01:57.284 --> 01:58.744
my foot feels fine now.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.537
So, I'm going to cancel

01:58.786 --> 02:00.537
that surgery

02:00.579 --> 02:02.163
and we'll see you Saturday.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.163
Wait a minute.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.165
They're inviting us

02:02.205 --> 02:04.165
only two days before

02:04.207 --> 02:05.417
we have to be there?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.417
Forget it, Hal.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.752
They don't want us there.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.004
But you can never be

02:06.794 --> 02:09.004
too careful with feet.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.172
Which is exactly

02:09.046 --> 02:11.172
why we should go.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.215
What am I thinking?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.009
I've already had foot surgery.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.636
Okay, so we'll see you Saturday.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.808
So what's Grandpa like?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.102
He's okay, but the

02:20.849 --> 02:23.102
rest of Dad's family

02:23.143 --> 02:25.186
treat Mom like crap;

02:23.143 --> 02:25.186
they're jerks.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.856
Rich jerks, and Grandpa's

02:25.228 --> 02:27.856
the richest of them all.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.650
And he loves kids;

02:27.898 --> 02:29.650
just say and do

02:29.691 --> 02:32.069
what I tell you,

02:29.691 --> 02:32.069
and we'll be set for life.

02:32.111 --> 02:34.279
You're nuts.

02:32.111 --> 02:34.279
Look, it's too late

02:32.111 --> 02:34.279
for you and me,

02:34.321 --> 02:36.031
but Dewey's still young

02:34.321 --> 02:36.031
and adorable.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.199
Although we do have

02:36.073 --> 02:38.199
a narrow window to work with.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.285
In a year, you're gonna

02:38.241 --> 02:40.285
look like a freak.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.870
Sorry it's so cramped, Piama.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.123
This van really isn't designed

02:41.912 --> 02:44.123
to carry seven people.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.416
Oh. I guess I was thrown off

02:44.164 --> 02:46.416
by the seven seats

02:46.458 --> 02:48.127
and the seven seat belts.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.795
Uh, Francis, how's that

02:48.167 --> 02:49.795
ranch job treating you?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.839
Oh, great.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.839
Never a dull moment.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.216
In fact, last week I got

02:51.880 --> 02:55.216
to castrate a bull calf.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.301
What does castrate mean?

02:56.343 --> 02:57.719
Ask your mother.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.014
You know, I have

02:57.761 --> 03:00.014
always wanted to know

03:00.055 --> 03:01.598
how to castrate

03:00.055 --> 03:01.598
a bull calf.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.808
Tell me about it.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.225
Well, it's

03:02.850 --> 03:04.225
fascinating stuff.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.853
We use this tool

03:04.267 --> 03:05.853
called a burdizzo--

03:05.894 --> 03:07.437
it looks like

03:05.894 --> 03:07.437
a giant pair of pliers--

03:07.479 --> 03:09.023
and the calf has

03:07.479 --> 03:09.023
to be restrained

03:09.064 --> 03:10.440
so that it

03:09.064 --> 03:10.440
doesn't kick...

03:10.482 --> 03:13.234
...so once you cut off

03:10.482 --> 03:13.234
their blood supply,

03:13.276 --> 03:16.488
they shrivel up and are

03:13.276 --> 03:16.488
replaced by fat tissue.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.866
What a great story, Francis.

03:18.907 --> 03:22.911
It really made the last hour

03:18.907 --> 03:22.911
and a half fly by.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.245
(sighs)

03:25.204 --> 03:26.707
Here come the clones.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.333
Hal, be nice.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.419
Hey, there's my kid brother!

03:31.461 --> 03:33.338
Hi, Claire. Hello, Tom.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.465
Hal, that shirt

03:33.380 --> 03:35.465
looks fabulous on you.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.258
Honey, isn't he

03:35.507 --> 03:37.258
looking handsome?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.259
(whistles)

03:38.301 --> 03:39.344
He certainly is.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.304
(coldly):

03:39.386 --> 03:41.304
Lois.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.223
(car horn plays tune)

03:45.308 --> 03:46.267
Hey!

03:46.309 --> 03:47.477
Who's this?

03:46.309 --> 03:47.477
Your cousin Pete.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.437
Pete-O!

03:49.479 --> 03:50.981
What's this?

03:51.023 --> 03:53.192
Your dad's birthday present;

03:51.023 --> 03:53.192
we all chipped in.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.944
We?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.944
We're going to

03:53.233 --> 03:55.944
chip in, too.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.279
Oh, don't worry,

03:55.986 --> 03:58.279
we'll put your name on the card.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.074
Eh, come on.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.282
Let's get you inside.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.326
You must be worn out

04:01.324 --> 04:03.326
from that drive.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.079
Actually, it

04:03.368 --> 04:05.079
wasn't so bad.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.123
Nonsense. Look at those

04:05.120 --> 04:08.123
sweat stains on Lois.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.300
Wow.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.720
It figures this is the side

04:19.342 --> 04:21.720
of the family we never see.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.681
Meanwhile, the grandma who

04:21.762 --> 04:24.681
goes shopping in her bra

04:24.723 --> 04:26.183
visits five times a year.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.308
We can leave right now.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.810
Just get in the car

04:27.350 --> 04:28.810
and drive.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.230
Sandusky Caverns is just

04:28.852 --> 04:31.230
40 minutes from here.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.190
Hal, relax.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.190
We can do this.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.315
I can't help it.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.734
I work myself into knots

04:35.776 --> 04:37.152
whenever I have to face

04:35.776 --> 04:37.152
the grand patriarch.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.653
Hi, Dad!

04:39.613 --> 04:42.157
Hal, you made it!

04:43.366 --> 04:45.744
Anybody help an old man

04:43.366 --> 04:45.744
out of the pool?

04:45.786 --> 04:47.579
I got you, Grandpa.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.375
Aah, right.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.088
(relatives cheer and applaud)

04:57.881 --> 04:59.591
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.593
What do you think

04:59.633 --> 05:01.593
that guy's for?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.053
His name is Francis.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.555
If you kill him, you

05:03.095 --> 05:05.555
don't get another one.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.349
(kids clamoring)

05:08.391 --> 05:10.393
(Francis screaming)

05:12.312 --> 05:14.648
Welcome one and all!

05:14.689 --> 05:15.649
Hey.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.234
(laughing)

05:17.276 --> 05:19.194
Lois.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.737
Dewey!

05:20.779 --> 05:21.947
Goodness, you've grown!

05:21.989 --> 05:24.074
I bet you don't

05:21.989 --> 05:24.074
even remember me.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.827
Yes, I do.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.246
You thang to me

05:26.868 --> 05:29.246
when I wath thweeping.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.081
You remember that?!

05:31.123 --> 05:33.000
Why, that's adorable!

05:33.041 --> 05:34.668
So good to see you, Dad.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.879
I have to admit, I was a little

05:34.709 --> 05:37.879
nervous about coming back here

05:37.921 --> 05:39.256
after so much time had gone by.

05:39.298 --> 05:40.381
I was expecting...

05:40.423 --> 05:41.800
Expecting car trouble?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.178
Because it looks like

05:41.842 --> 05:44.178
you packed a spare tire!

05:44.219 --> 05:47.181
(cackling)

05:47.222 --> 05:48.640
Ah, Malcolm!

05:48.682 --> 05:51.476
I understand they finally

05:48.682 --> 05:51.476
figured out you're a genius.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.812
What's your favorite subject

05:51.518 --> 05:53.812
in school?

05:53.854 --> 05:54.980
I don't know. History.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.315
History, is it?

05:56.355 --> 05:58.984
What do you think

05:56.355 --> 05:58.984
about the Civil War?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.986
I guess it's kind

05:59.026 --> 06:00.986
of interesting.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.404
Ooh. Have I got something

06:01.028 --> 06:03.404
to show you!

06:03.446 --> 06:05.032
There you two are!

06:03.446 --> 06:05.032
LOIS: Hi, Amelia.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.202
This reunion is going

06:05.073 --> 06:08.202
to be the death of me.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.328
Feeding this many

06:08.243 --> 06:09.328
people every day.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.871
Keeping track

06:09.368 --> 06:10.871
of all the kids.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.414
I swear I had to run the croquet

06:10.912 --> 06:13.414
tournament on Thursday

06:13.456 --> 06:14.457
all by myself.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.293
Tomorrow we've got

06:14.499 --> 06:16.293
a pancake breakfast,

06:16.335 --> 06:18.419
a family photo

06:16.335 --> 06:18.419
at 3:00, a birthday

06:16.335 --> 06:18.419
dinner at 5:00

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
and gifts at 6:00,

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
all with no one to

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
take charge but me.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.423
This is what

06:20.964 --> 06:22.423
General Schwarzkopf

06:22.465 --> 06:25.426
must have felt like

06:22.465 --> 06:25.426
during Desert Storm!

06:25.468 --> 06:30.557
Lois, no one else is

06:25.468 --> 06:30.557
wearing a name tag.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.435
Hal, it's fine.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.898
Hey, untie his hands

06:34.477 --> 06:37.898
and give him his pants back!

06:37.939 --> 06:40.817
You're the only grandkid

06:37.939 --> 06:40.817
I've let in here.

06:40.859 --> 06:44.363
These are my  most

06:40.859 --> 06:44.363
precious possessions.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.446
Cool.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.157
Oh, never mind that stuff.

06:47.199 --> 06:50.327
You don't want to waste your

06:47.199 --> 06:50.327
time with a bunch of guns.

06:50.369 --> 06:53.247
Take a look at this

06:50.369 --> 06:53.247
quartermasters' ledger books.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.333
This is where the war

06:53.288 --> 06:56.333
was really won.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.918
Take a look at this.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.419
Notice anything?

07:01.588 --> 07:04.049
Oh, yeah. The numbers

07:01.588 --> 07:04.049
don't add up here.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.049
Ah.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.342
What?

07:05.384 --> 07:06.551
In that column.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.678
The numbers add up to 1,286

07:08.720 --> 07:10.931
but the total at the bottom

07:08.720 --> 07:10.931
says 1,179.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.976
I was just hoping you'd notice

07:10.972 --> 07:14.976
how the S's look like F's

07:15.018 --> 07:16.477
but this is incredible.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.148
I think this quartermaster

07:16.519 --> 07:20.148
was skimming rifles.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.483
This is the kind of thing

07:20.190 --> 07:22.483
that gets your name

07:22.525 --> 07:23.944
in the  Civil War Quarterly.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.653
Good job, Malcolm!

07:25.695 --> 07:29.490
(grunting):

07:25.695 --> 07:29.490
Let's see what else

07:25.695 --> 07:29.490
this guy was up to!

07:29.532 --> 07:31.492
(grunts)

07:31.534 --> 07:33.954
I would never be

07:31.534 --> 07:33.954
massaged by a woman.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.997
I mean, you need

07:33.995 --> 07:35.997
that strength.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.665
When my body's in need,

07:37.707 --> 07:40.710
I want a man to

07:37.707 --> 07:40.710
really get in there.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.504
FRANCIS:

07:40.752 --> 07:43.504
Okay, just one more lap.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.672
(laughter)

07:44.714 --> 07:46.425
(Francis grunting)

07:46.466 --> 07:49.386
Boy, those kids have really

07:46.466 --> 07:49.386
taken a shine to Francis.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.596
He's not ready

07:49.428 --> 07:51.596
for kids, Piama;

07:49.428 --> 07:51.596
don't rush him.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.806
More cake, Lois?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.141
Oh, no, thank you.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.516
Ah, don't be shy.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.518
I saw the way you scarfed

07:55.558 --> 07:57.518
down your first piece.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.521
Oh, I'm sorry, you're probably

07:57.560 --> 08:00.521
on a diet, aren't you?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.527
Dad?

08:06.569 --> 08:08.155
Have you seen the cookies?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.823
We have to talk.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.116
It's about Lois.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.160
Ever since we got here,

08:13.201 --> 08:15.620
the family's taken

08:13.201 --> 08:15.620
every opportunity to...

08:15.662 --> 08:16.704
(snickers)

08:16.746 --> 08:18.539
Dad, don't do the face.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.540
What face?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.126
No, you know the face!

08:21.168 --> 08:22.627
Don't do that, I'm serious.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.213
(goofy voice):

08:22.669 --> 08:25.213
Oh. Can I do the voice?

08:25.255 --> 08:27.382
(cracking up)

08:27.424 --> 08:28.591
Dad, I'm not kidding.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.552
(goofy voice):

08:28.633 --> 08:31.552
Then why are you laughing?

08:31.594 --> 08:33.013
Dad!

08:33.054 --> 08:35.474
Nothing funny heeere.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.725
No, sireeeeee!

08:37.767 --> 08:39.560
(humming)

08:39.602 --> 08:41.562
(laughing hysterically)

08:41.604 --> 08:46.276
(still laughing)

08:46.318 --> 08:49.529
(mutters)

08:50.530 --> 08:52.115
(mutters)

09:08.631 --> 09:11.301
Okay, you want a story,

09:08.631 --> 09:11.301
here's a story.

09:11.343 --> 09:15.263
It's called "The Kids Who

09:11.343 --> 09:15.263
Couldn't Play By Themselves."

09:15.305 --> 09:16.848
We did some good work today.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.599
Tomorrow, we'll hit Grandpa

09:18.641 --> 09:21.686
with the "Good Ship Lollipop"

09:18.641 --> 09:21.686
number right after breakfast.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.438
I want to swim in the pool.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.606
You can swim in the pool

09:23.480 --> 09:25.606
when we own the pool.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.608
Nice angle you're working

09:25.648 --> 09:27.608
with Grandpa, Malcolm.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.694
I have to admit, you're getting

09:27.650 --> 09:29.694
a lot of face time

09:29.736 --> 09:31.654
but when he croaks,

09:29.736 --> 09:31.654
all he's gonna leave you

09:31.696 --> 09:33.073
is that stupid Civil War crap.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.700
Reese...

09:33.114 --> 09:35.700
You can have it, but I want it

09:35.742 --> 09:37.577
out of the house.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.331
Back off Grandpa.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.331
He's ours.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.208
What?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.460
We've been working this guy

09:43.250 --> 09:45.460
for three years,

09:45.502 --> 09:48.213
and we're not about

09:45.502 --> 09:48.213
to let you waltz in here

09:48.255 --> 09:50.131
and snake him out

09:48.255 --> 09:50.131
from under us.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.632
What are you saying?

09:51.674 --> 09:56.096
It's a big house;

09:51.674 --> 09:56.096
accidents happen.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.474
...and then the little boy,

09:57.472 --> 09:59.474
about your age,

09:59.516 --> 10:02.227
was found hanging

09:59.516 --> 10:02.227
in the moonlight,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.729
strangled by his own intestines.

10:04.771 --> 10:09.234
And there was just enough life

10:04.771 --> 10:09.234
left in him to say...

10:09.276 --> 10:10.360
"You're next!!"

10:10.402 --> 10:11.736
(all screaming)

10:11.778 --> 10:14.655
(screaming continues)

10:14.697 --> 10:16.741
(kids screaming)

10:16.783 --> 10:17.867
Come out!

10:17.909 --> 10:20.120
He was lying;

10:17.909 --> 10:20.120
it was just a story.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.666
(muttering softly)

10:25.708 --> 10:28.920
All I want is two seconds

10:25.708 --> 10:28.920
of honest, human conversation

10:28.962 --> 10:31.672
with my own father.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.925
I mean, what is so awful

10:31.714 --> 10:33.925
about me

10:33.967 --> 10:38.096
that he has to distance himself

10:33.967 --> 10:38.096
with jokes and silly faces?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.557
Hal, you're not going

10:38.138 --> 10:40.557
to make any progress

10:40.599 --> 10:43.477
if you keep personalizing

10:40.599 --> 10:43.477
other people's problems.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.853
We've talked about this.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.853
You just don't get it.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.730
How could you? You don't

10:45.895 --> 10:47.730
have any father issues.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.691
I'm blessed.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.402
There's got to be some way

10:50.733 --> 10:52.402
to break this cycle.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.696
Some way to make my dad

10:52.444 --> 10:55.696
let his guard down

10:55.738 --> 10:59.409
and engage me

10:55.738 --> 10:59.409
on an emotional level...

10:59.451 --> 11:00.868
Are you even listening?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.621
Sorry.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.539
Oh!

11:04.581 --> 11:06.707
Hal, the answer

11:04.581 --> 11:06.707
to this is simple.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.627
You just have to

11:06.749 --> 11:08.627
look at your life;

11:08.668 --> 11:10.211
look at what you've

11:08.668 --> 11:10.211
accomplished.

11:10.253 --> 11:13.214
You  have  a good relationship

11:10.253 --> 11:13.214
with your sons.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.716
They can talk to you

11:13.256 --> 11:15.716
about anything.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.011
You have a wife

11:15.758 --> 11:18.011
and home and family

11:18.052 --> 11:20.430
a lot of people

11:18.052 --> 11:20.430
would envy.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.389
You're past this.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.432
You think?

11:22.474 --> 11:23.724
Yes, I do.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.811
Hal, you're all grown up.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.022
(gasps)

11:29.063 --> 11:30.357
Uh-oh.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.732
What?

11:31.774 --> 11:33.443
I...

11:33.485 --> 11:35.654
I wet the bed.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.743
Oh, that tears it,

11:40.950 --> 11:42.743
Lois.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.745
You know I've been

11:42.785 --> 11:44.745
telling myself that

11:42.785 --> 11:44.745
everything's okay,

11:44.787 --> 11:46.331
but my bladder knew different.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.749
I am not leaving here until

11:46.373 --> 11:48.749
I've had this out with my dad.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.751
Hal, are you sure

11:48.791 --> 11:50.751
you want to do this?

11:50.793 --> 11:52.420
Lois, he just sits by

11:52.462 --> 11:54.005
while everyone treats

11:52.462 --> 11:54.005
you like a dog,

11:54.047 --> 11:56.049
when they're not treating

11:54.047 --> 11:56.049
you like a servant.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.468
It's not that bad.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.468
Did you notice last night

11:58.510 --> 12:00.053
when you gave Helen

11:58.510 --> 12:00.053
your chair

12:00.094 --> 12:02.597
and she flipped

12:00.094 --> 12:02.597
the cushion over

12:00.094 --> 12:02.597
before she sat down?

12:02.639 --> 12:05.308
No.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.649
Why are we staring

12:10.771 --> 12:12.649
at a mall, Grandpa?

12:12.691 --> 12:14.609
This is a battlefield,

12:12.691 --> 12:14.609
Private,

12:14.651 --> 12:15.776
and I'm not your Grandpa.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.778
I'm Captain Atticus

12:15.818 --> 12:17.778
P. Featherton,

12:17.820 --> 12:21.824
commander of

12:17.820 --> 12:21.824
the Company "A" cavalry.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.784
It's 1864.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.620
Cannonballs

12:23.826 --> 12:25.620
are flying overhead.

12:25.662 --> 12:29.207
The nostrils curl with

12:25.662 --> 12:29.207
the smell of burning flesh.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.792
Can I get a yogurt?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.794
You're ravaged by dysentery,

12:31.834 --> 12:33.794
you don't want a yogurt.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.296
WOMAN:

12:33.836 --> 12:35.296
Edith, where are my keys?

12:35.338 --> 12:36.964
They're supposed to be

12:35.338 --> 12:36.964
in the key thingy.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.841
I can't trust you

12:37.006 --> 12:38.841
with anything.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.801
Now, there's

12:38.883 --> 12:40.801
Confederate sharpshooters

12:40.843 --> 12:42.429
on that ridge over there.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.805
We have to sit very still

12:42.470 --> 12:44.805
while we wait for our orders

12:44.847 --> 12:46.807
or they'll pick us off

12:44.847 --> 12:46.807
one by one.

12:46.849 --> 12:50.311
But...

12:46.849 --> 12:50.311
Very still, Private.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.108
More still than that!

12:57.318 --> 12:59.654
Isn't this great?

12:59.696 --> 13:01.656
(chuckles)

13:03.116 --> 13:05.076
I asked for these

13:03.116 --> 13:05.076
to be ironed.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.786
What is wrong

13:05.118 --> 13:07.786
with you people?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.464
Nice touch with

13:15.462 --> 13:17.464
the backwards "E."

13:17.505 --> 13:20.216
You've got a real gift

13:17.505 --> 13:20.216
for this butt kissing stuff.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.842
We are so in.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.803
What do you mean "we"?

13:27.806 --> 13:29.850
Ma, you got to let us

13:27.806 --> 13:29.850
hide in here; these kids...

13:29.892 --> 13:30.935
What's wrong?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.562
Oh, I forgot to pack

13:30.977 --> 13:32.562
my good shoes.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.230
I can't believe it.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.230
What am I supposed to do?

13:34.272 --> 13:35.856
All I've got are my sneakers.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.942
I'm supposed to take them off

13:35.898 --> 13:37.942
and run around barefoot

13:37.984 --> 13:39.778
like a hillbilly

13:37.984 --> 13:39.778
in front of these people?

13:39.818 --> 13:41.154
Mom, it's just shoes.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.154
Relax.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.863
Oh, Francis,

13:41.195 --> 13:42.863
it's not just shoes.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.157
You have no idea

13:42.905 --> 13:44.157
what it's like

13:44.198 --> 13:45.866
trying to please

13:44.198 --> 13:45.866
someone else's family

13:45.908 --> 13:47.868
and always coming up short.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.870
And would it kill you

13:47.910 --> 13:49.870
to dress up a little

13:49.912 --> 13:51.830
for a family picture?

13:55.293 --> 13:57.504
Oh, hey, Hal.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.255
You know, that Malcolm of yours

13:59.297 --> 14:01.090
doesn't handle the heat

13:59.297 --> 14:01.090
very well.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.510
Dad, we need to talk.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.510
This is serious.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.679
Then I better put on

14:03.551 --> 14:05.679
my serious face.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.597
No, Dad, no faces.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.474
Unless we deal with this,

14:09.516 --> 14:11.892
you and I will never have

14:09.516 --> 14:11.892
a meaningful relationship.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.894
Our relationship is fine.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.896
No, it's not fine.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.982
There's a big piece missing.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.317
Oh, sure we laugh,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.486
we-we have fun,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.486
but that's all we do.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.903
We just skim along

14:21.528 --> 14:22.903
the surface

14:22.945 --> 14:25.615
without talking about

14:22.945 --> 14:25.615
anything important.

14:25.657 --> 14:26.991
Do you understand?

14:27.033 --> 14:29.828
Let's ask Mr. Tickles.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.162
(laughing)

14:31.204 --> 14:32.747
Remember, Mr. Tickles?

14:32.789 --> 14:34.207
(cackling)

14:34.248 --> 14:35.792
No, Dad, I mean it!

14:35.834 --> 14:38.085
(goofy voice):

14:35.834 --> 14:38.085
Well, Mr. Tickles means it, too.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.920
(cackling)

14:39.962 --> 14:42.423
We used to do this all the

14:39.962 --> 14:42.423
time when you were a kid.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.301
You loved Mr. Tickles.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.928
Ooh, it's almost picture time.

14:47.970 --> 14:48.971
(laughs)

14:49.013 --> 14:51.307
Hey, this was fun, Hal.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.601
I'm glad you're

14:51.349 --> 14:53.601
feeling better.

14:53.643 --> 14:58.481
(frustrated scream):

14:53.643 --> 14:58.481
Oh!

15:00.650 --> 15:03.403
That's not where

15:00.650 --> 15:03.403
we keep the liquor.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.821
I'm not looking

15:03.444 --> 15:04.821
for liquor.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.947
I'm looking for shoes.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.742
For some reason,

15:06.989 --> 15:08.742
I forgot to pack

15:06.989 --> 15:08.742
my good shoes

15:08.783 --> 15:10.577
and now I have nothing to wear

15:08.783 --> 15:10.577
with this dress

15:10.618 --> 15:13.037
that I rushed out to buy so I

15:10.618 --> 15:13.037
would look nice for this family

15:13.079 --> 15:14.121
that thinks I can't

15:14.163 --> 15:15.956
do anything right.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.584
You know what?

15:17.625 --> 15:21.212
I have some extra shoes

15:17.625 --> 15:21.212
in the back of our car.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.214
I bet they might fit you.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.674
Really?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.967
It's the black Jaguar

15:24.716 --> 15:26.967
parked out by the gate.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.219
It's unlocked.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.056
Thank you. Really.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.105
Don't you guys want to be

15:36.811 --> 15:39.105
with your parents?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.400
My socks are itchy.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.069
Malcolm, I hear

15:42.442 --> 15:45.069
your sock itchiness

15:45.111 --> 15:46.987
and I'm glad you're

15:45.111 --> 15:46.987
telling me about it.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.865
You boys should know

15:47.029 --> 15:48.865
that I am here for you

15:48.907 --> 15:49.990
anytime you want

15:48.907 --> 15:49.990
to talk about anything.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.451
After we get this picture taken,

15:51.492 --> 15:53.160
I'm going to spend

15:51.492 --> 15:53.160
some time with each of you

15:53.202 --> 15:55.246
because I am involved

15:53.202 --> 15:55.246
and into everything

15:55.288 --> 15:56.790
that's going on

15:55.288 --> 15:56.790
with this family.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.041
Where's your mother?

15:59.083 --> 16:00.293
LOIS:

15:59.083 --> 16:00.293
Amelia?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.002
There aren't any shoes

16:00.334 --> 16:02.002
in your car.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.212
Are you sure...?

16:03.254 --> 16:06.006
PHOTOGRAPHER:

16:03.254 --> 16:06.006
Okay, everybody, big smiles.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.675
Cheese on three.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.675
One, two...

16:07.717 --> 16:08.718
three.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.928
Cheese!

16:09.969 --> 16:11.763
Okay, let me get

16:09.969 --> 16:11.763
one more real quick.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.849
Excellent.

16:14.891 --> 16:15.934
Thank you, everybody.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.310
(applause)

16:18.895 --> 16:22.064
You weren't

16:18.895 --> 16:22.064
in the photo, Lois?

16:22.106 --> 16:23.691
(sighs)

16:23.733 --> 16:27.403
Well, I guess we can try

16:23.733 --> 16:27.403
to take another one.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.239
You know, if we can

16:27.445 --> 16:30.239
regather everybody.

16:30.281 --> 16:34.034
And if we can get

16:30.281 --> 16:34.034
the photographer back.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.745
And talk to the caterers

16:35.787 --> 16:38.456
to see if they can

16:35.787 --> 16:38.456
hold off on dinner.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.333
Lois, where were you?

16:58.810 --> 16:59.936
(door slams)

16:59.978 --> 17:01.688
Honey?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.149
Honey?

17:05.191 --> 17:06.860
Honey... (sighs)

17:06.901 --> 17:09.362
God.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.991
(plastic crunches)

17:13.032 --> 17:15.034
(crying)

17:33.553 --> 17:36.222
Hey, is Lois going

17:33.553 --> 17:36.222
to help with the salad?

17:37.515 --> 17:41.185
Oh, God. More drama

17:37.515 --> 17:41.185
from that woman.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.695
What are you

17:49.402 --> 17:50.695
going to do?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.614
We don't know.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.614
We never know.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.203
Hal...

17:59.245 --> 18:01.831
what are you doing?

18:01.873 --> 18:04.124
Taking a stand

18:01.873 --> 18:04.124
for my dignity.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.710
You've driven me

18:04.166 --> 18:05.710
to this, Dad.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.127
My wife is upstairs crying

18:07.169 --> 18:09.129
because of the way

18:07.169 --> 18:09.129
this family treats her

18:09.171 --> 18:10.548
and it's got to stop.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.758
(goofy voice):

18:10.590 --> 18:11.758
Uh-oh.

18:11.799 --> 18:15.219
Someone's a Gloomy Gus.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.766
You never face up to any

18:17.221 --> 18:19.766
real problems, do you?

18:19.807 --> 18:23.019
You just think if you

18:19.807 --> 18:23.019
make enough jokes,

18:19.807 --> 18:23.019
they'll all go away.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.229
Don't you see that

18:23.061 --> 18:25.229
through my entire life,

18:25.271 --> 18:26.647
you've avoided

18:25.271 --> 18:26.647
dealing with me

18:26.689 --> 18:28.566
whenever I was going

18:26.689 --> 18:28.566
through a tough time?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.192
Really, this is

18:28.608 --> 18:30.192
beyond the pale.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.029
You never helped me when

18:30.234 --> 18:33.029
my girlfriend dumped me...

18:30.234 --> 18:33.029
(laughs)

18:33.071 --> 18:35.155
when my dog died...

18:33.071 --> 18:35.155
Hey.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.157
when my best friend

18:35.197 --> 18:37.157
moved away...

18:37.199 --> 18:39.159
when I got beaten up

18:37.199 --> 18:39.159
at school...

18:39.201 --> 18:41.161
when I spent

18:39.201 --> 18:41.161
a whole summer crying

18:41.203 --> 18:42.162
and I didn't know why!

18:42.204 --> 18:44.206
(laughing):

18:42.204 --> 18:44.206
Hal, stop it!

18:44.248 --> 18:45.583
And you haven't helped me

18:44.248 --> 18:45.583
while my family has been

18:45.625 --> 18:47.460
habitually tormenting my wife

18:47.501 --> 18:51.422
to the point where I've had

18:47.501 --> 18:51.422
to avoid both them and you!

18:51.464 --> 18:53.340
(laughing)

18:53.382 --> 18:56.636
I haven't had a father

18:53.382 --> 18:56.636
for the past 15 years

18:56.677 --> 18:59.430
because you won't deal

18:56.677 --> 18:59.430
with anything!

18:59.472 --> 19:02.683
(laughter subsiding)

19:04.936 --> 19:07.021
Okay, that's off my chest.

19:07.063 --> 19:10.190
I hope you heard it.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.192
I love you, Dad.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.950
I'll go get you a towel.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.620
One of the old ones, please.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.916
All right, everybody ready?

19:26.958 --> 19:29.710
I was born ready.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.545
(horn blows)

19:32.505 --> 19:34.173
(whistles)

19:38.260 --> 19:40.763
(screaming)

19:44.058 --> 19:45.810
(screams)

19:45.852 --> 19:48.228
The cake!

19:48.270 --> 19:49.522
The cake!

19:48.270 --> 19:49.522
The cart!

19:49.563 --> 19:51.190
(screaming)

20:27.393 --> 20:30.479
We had to get out of there

20:27.393 --> 20:30.479
pretty fast for our own safety.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.273
It was unbelievable.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.273
We drove three blocks

20:33.315 --> 20:35.568
before Aunt Claire let go

20:33.315 --> 20:35.568
of the door handle.

20:35.609 --> 20:39.155
I am so very disappointed

20:35.609 --> 20:39.155
in all of you.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.157
I don't care

20:39.197 --> 20:41.157
what those people did,

20:41.199 --> 20:43.283
that was no way

20:41.199 --> 20:43.283
for you to behave.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.284
Right, Hal?

20:44.326 --> 20:45.953
Yeah, you boys

20:44.326 --> 20:45.953
are on notice.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.956
If you  ever  drive a golf

20:45.995 --> 20:48.956
cart over a catered dinner

20:48.998 --> 20:50.332
and into a

20:48.998 --> 20:50.332
swimming pool again,

20:50.374 --> 20:54.754
there will be consequences.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.754
Dire consequences.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.548
I guess we just kissed off

20:54.795 --> 20:57.548
a six-figure trust fund.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.884
I told Grandpa you tied

20:57.590 --> 20:59.884
me to the golf cart.

20:59.926 --> 21:00.968
What?!

21:01.010 --> 21:03.554
He still likes you.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.556
Nice, we're back

21:03.596 --> 21:05.556
in the game.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.559
Yeah.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.310
Oh, Piama.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.271
Is that too much air on you?

21:13.231 --> 21:15.024
No.
