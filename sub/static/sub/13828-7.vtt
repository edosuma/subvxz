WEBVTT

00:04.631 --> 00:06.754
OR called back.
They're ready for him.

00:06.925 --> 00:09.083
- Let's get moving.
- Little help, Dwayne?

00:10.094 --> 00:11.802
Hey. Is he talking yet?

00:11.971 --> 00:15.221
Sorry, this is a restricted area
and we need to get him to the OR.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.301
- No one's going anywhere.
- Is that so?

00:18.102 --> 00:19.976
- Hey!
- Think I'm playing, doc?

00:20.146 --> 00:21.346
- It's okay.
- Get him talking.

00:21.523 --> 00:22.933
It's not that easy.

00:23.107 --> 00:26.642
- Do it or I'm gonna kill every one...
- Don't have to point that.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.978
- He has a severe injury.
- Just do it!

00:30.698 --> 00:32.357
- Anaesthetic is in.
- Thank you.

00:34.285 --> 00:39.078
- What were you fishing for?
- Oh, catfish, sunfish, striped bass.

00:39.249 --> 00:42.249
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah. This is Mr. Perez.

00:42.418 --> 00:45.503
I need you to stabilise the base
so I can cut the barb...

00:45.672 --> 00:47.629
back the rest out
- Okay.

00:47.799 --> 00:49.957
- How you doing today?
- I'm doing good.

00:50.134 --> 00:52.092
Good. Thank you.

00:52.262 --> 00:54.587
So everything good with you
and Scott?

00:55.056 --> 00:57.428
- All good. We'll talk about it later.
- Okay.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.602
T, we just got a call.

01:00.770 --> 01:03.344
Small plane went down
near Government Canyon Park.

01:03.523 --> 01:05.480
No road access. Gotta chopper in.

01:05.650 --> 01:07.808
I'll handle it.
Get Krista to come in.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.145
Where were we?

01:10.613 --> 01:13.151
You're kind of sweet on him.

01:13.992 --> 01:15.106
We're all done.

01:15.285 --> 01:17.076
Be careful out there.

01:17.328 --> 01:20.329
- You're gonna have the eye surgery?
- In a couple of months.

01:20.498 --> 01:24.247
Scott got me to the top of the list
at Dallas Memorial with Dr. Clodfelter.

01:24.419 --> 01:25.913
- That's exciting.
- Yeah.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.080
How much will it improve
your vision?

01:28.256 --> 01:31.874
With the new laser technique,
he says up to 50 percent.

01:32.177 --> 01:34.086
- It's gonna change your life.
- Yeah.

01:35.138 --> 01:38.507
- So three tours in Afghanistan, huh?
- Yeah.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.345
I did a double.

01:40.685 --> 01:43.306
- We lost a lot of good men over there.
- We did.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.272
<i>Keep your head down.</i>

01:45.440 --> 01:49.023
It's a long way from shooting BB guns
in the backyard, eh, T?

01:49.194 --> 01:53.061
Yeah. I don't think mom would like this,
but dad might.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.991
- We're moving in.
- We should wait for support.

01:56.826 --> 02:00.361
Quit being such a sissy doctor,
baby bro. Take the back entrance.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.080
Watch your six.

02:08.213 --> 02:12.127
I gotta say,
I never liked riding in choppers.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.506
Always feel like they're about
to crash.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.504
Move! Go, go!

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.108 --> 02:31.599
Dr. Callahan? Doctor?

02:31.778 --> 02:33.355
Dr. Callahan?

02:33.530 --> 02:35.652
- We're coming up on the site.
- Right.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.030
There they are.
Get us down there ASAP.

02:38.201 --> 02:41.036
I can't, there's no place to land
with all these trees.

02:41.204 --> 02:44.324
All I can do is drop you a couple
miles back, you can hike in.

02:44.499 --> 02:46.491
They'll be dead
by the time we hike in.

02:46.668 --> 02:48.956
Sorry, it's too dangerous.

02:49.796 --> 02:53.247
Topher, what do you say
we do this old school, huh?

02:53.675 --> 02:56.676
Son of a bitch.
I knew you were gonna suggest that.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.462
Twenty-four, female,
status post fall from pole...

03:00.640 --> 03:02.218
with cervical flexion injury.

03:02.392 --> 03:05.061
- A pole? What kind of pole?
- A stripper pole.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.789
I dance at
The Bare Trap Gentlemen's Club...

03:06.813 --> 03:08.521
over by the Pan Am Expressway.

03:08.690 --> 03:10.835
I can't believe I fell off.
It's never happened before.

03:10.859 --> 03:14.144
Let's take her to exam one
and get some x-rays. I'm Dr. Alister.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.405
We'll be checking you over,
make sure everything's okay.

03:17.574 --> 03:21.156
Paul, Paul? Looks like
you wanna help out with this one?

03:21.327 --> 03:22.738
Yes, yes. Let's do it.

03:24.497 --> 03:28.874
- Dr. Cummings, so nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

03:32.046 --> 03:38.049
Hey, Paul, a little hint, her eyes,
like, they're up here.

03:38.219 --> 03:41.339
- Of course. I got... Yeah.
- All right? Okay, good talk.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.176
You ready?

03:45.351 --> 03:46.431
See you down there.

04:08.208 --> 04:09.287
This guy's dead.

04:11.503 --> 04:13.329
We got another one over here.

04:15.131 --> 04:16.375
This one's still alive.

04:18.343 --> 04:20.216
Grab his legs.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.301
Hey, hey, I'm Dr. Callahan.

04:24.057 --> 04:25.219
We're gonna help you.

04:25.391 --> 04:27.680
- What's your name, buddy?
- Eric.

04:27.852 --> 04:29.928
We were flying back
from our golf retreat.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.856
The engine stalled out of nowhere.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.023
- How's Barry?
- You mean the pilot?

04:36.194 --> 04:39.361
I'm sorry. He didn't... Eric? Eric?

04:40.740 --> 04:42.733
I'm losing his pulse. Start CPR.

04:42.909 --> 04:44.403
Oh, this is not good.

04:44.577 --> 04:46.486
- What?
- His chest wall's collapsed.

04:46.663 --> 04:49.996
We gotta pop the clavicle out
or he's a dead man.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.125
- Hold him down.
- Yeah.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.333
All right.

04:57.757 --> 04:59.833
Come on. Come on.

05:05.849 --> 05:07.556
Yeah.

05:08.059 --> 05:10.217
Send the basket down.
We gotta get him out.

05:10.395 --> 05:12.055
<i>Copy that. It's on its way.</i>

05:12.230 --> 05:15.397
Let's place him in a C collar
and get him ready for evac.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.399
Look at this. Hello.

05:19.571 --> 05:22.275
I don't think these guys were golfing.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.493
<i>Dr. Sablok to OR 4. Dr. Sablok, please...</i>

05:27.662 --> 05:28.741
Incoming.

05:29.414 --> 05:31.323
Krista, you're up.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.407
Sixteen-year-old female
with shortness of breath.

05:34.586 --> 05:35.748
Unclear aetiology.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.118
- What's her name?
- Nina.

05:37.297 --> 05:38.921
Okay. We'll take a listen.

05:39.090 --> 05:41.213
Sats are normal and lungs are clear.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.840
Nina, I'm Dr. Bell-Hart.
What's going on?

05:44.012 --> 05:46.716
There's a problem with your throat?

05:50.768 --> 05:52.049
- Holy crap.
- What is it?

05:53.188 --> 05:54.979
- She swallowed a fork.
- What?

05:55.148 --> 05:57.354
Heather, take care of the parents.
Get her to Trauma 1.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.565
It's okay. I'm right here, honey.

06:21.716 --> 06:22.795
- I see the fork.
- Good.

06:22.967 --> 06:26.835
Now, firmly grab it at the base
and gently pull.

06:30.350 --> 06:32.426
Damn it. I lost it.
It slipped further down.

06:32.602 --> 06:34.808
Sats are dropping.
Pulse ox is down to 83.

06:34.979 --> 06:37.351
Okay, Krista, we have to do this now.

06:38.066 --> 06:39.893
- I can't grab it.
- Yes, you can.

06:40.068 --> 06:42.440
- Sats are 79 percent.
- Okay, focus.

06:46.783 --> 06:47.814
Breathe.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.489
Wait, I got it.

06:50.745 --> 06:52.868
Okay, good. Pull it out.

06:56.042 --> 06:57.453
Okay.

07:00.088 --> 07:01.997
Okay.

07:03.341 --> 07:05.666
Sats coming up. Very good, Krista.

07:05.844 --> 07:08.880
Now all we have to do is figure out
how it got in there.

07:11.266 --> 07:13.970
Lauren, send off a trauma panel.
Notify the blood bank...

07:14.143 --> 07:16.163
we're activating
the massive transfusion protocol.

07:16.187 --> 07:17.350
- Yes, doc.
- Dr. Callahan.

07:17.522 --> 07:21.057
This is Agent Milo Osborne of the DEA,
he is assigned to the case.

07:21.234 --> 07:24.021
FBI was tracking a small plane
that was flying low...

07:24.195 --> 07:26.817
over the border,
carrying suspected smugglers.

07:26.990 --> 07:29.694
Made a stop in Brownsville.
Feds blew it and lost it.

07:29.868 --> 07:31.777
- Anybody else on board?
- Pilot was DOA.

07:31.953 --> 07:34.788
This was the only guy,
and some of these.

07:34.956 --> 07:37.708
I'll take that for evidence.
How soon can I talk to him?

07:37.876 --> 07:39.619
Hey, we have to stabilise him first.

07:39.794 --> 07:42.368
He has a severe crush injury
to his chest and abdomen.

07:42.547 --> 07:44.456
We will let you know
when he's speaking.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.090
- So I'm okay?
- Yeah, you look great.

07:49.262 --> 07:52.133
The x-rays are normal.
We think it's just a strain, so...

07:52.307 --> 07:55.473
We're waiting on the labs.
Wanna make double sure you're okay.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.810
Boys, I appreciate the concern,
but I gotta get back to work.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.436
If I leave now, I can still make
some cash tonight.

08:01.608 --> 08:03.896
I gotta go deal with another patient.

08:04.068 --> 08:07.022
Candy, I can promise you
it's gonna be a half-hour tops.

08:07.197 --> 08:09.485
Paul, don't let her leave.

08:10.116 --> 08:11.527
He's cute. Too bad he's gay.

08:12.118 --> 08:15.119
- How'd you know that?
- I get stared at by men for a living.

08:15.288 --> 08:18.455
I know when somebody's not looking
at me like the way you are now.

08:18.625 --> 08:19.787
No, no, no.

08:19.959 --> 08:22.960
I mean, you're my patient,
so I have to look at you.

08:23.129 --> 08:26.130
- How could I not look at you?
- It's okay, I don't mind.

08:26.716 --> 08:29.088
- You know what, I gotta get back.
- Right.

08:29.260 --> 08:32.546
Just call me at the Trap
if there's a problem.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.597
How much money would you need
to stay and maybe help me out?

08:36.768 --> 08:39.057
Because I was just thinking...

08:39.562 --> 08:40.592
Thinking what?

08:41.898 --> 08:44.815
Well, my girlfriend
comes into town tomorrow...

08:44.984 --> 08:47.310
she has never exactly spent
the night before.

08:47.487 --> 08:49.942
I thought you might be able
to help me with that.

08:51.115 --> 08:52.740
You're a virgin.

08:52.909 --> 08:54.487
That's so cute.

08:55.328 --> 08:57.901
But I'm not a hooker, you know.
There is a difference.

08:58.081 --> 09:01.247
No, no, I wasn't suggesting...
Could you come back, please, please?

09:01.709 --> 09:02.789
Thank you.

09:02.961 --> 09:04.787
Look, I just thought...

09:06.089 --> 09:09.624
I have a lot of questions
about women...

09:09.801 --> 09:12.718
if I ask the guys,
they would never let me live it down.

09:12.887 --> 09:14.844
I haven't even told them
she's coming.

09:15.014 --> 09:17.256
So look, if I paid you for your time...

09:17.433 --> 09:19.806
could you may be clear up
some things for me?

09:19.978 --> 09:22.682
You know, the how-tos, the when-tos.

09:25.984 --> 09:28.901
Hi, Nina.
Are you feeling better now?

09:29.070 --> 09:30.612
Good.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.869
I'm Dr. Bell-Hart.

09:41.332 --> 09:43.455
I took the fork out of your throat.

09:43.626 --> 09:44.824
Thanks.

09:47.130 --> 09:48.707
So listen...

09:48.882 --> 09:51.918
I'm pretty sure you weren't trying
to hurt yourself.

09:53.469 --> 09:56.589
But I have a good idea
how the fork got down there.

09:59.058 --> 10:00.434
Your loss of tooth enamel.

10:03.813 --> 10:06.304
And the calluses on your fingers.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.145
These are all signs of bulimia.

10:09.944 --> 10:11.818
I'm not bulimic.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.277
You know...

10:19.662 --> 10:22.449
the reason why I recognised
these signs...

10:22.624 --> 10:25.743
is not because I'm a doctor.

10:26.586 --> 10:28.662
It's because...

10:30.965 --> 10:33.966
I was bulimic through most
of high school.

10:34.135 --> 10:37.836
When I first saw that fork, I thought,
"Maybe I should step in here."

10:38.014 --> 10:41.513
Then, when she didn't get it at first,
the seconds, they felt like hours.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.888
But she pulled through,
so I was proud of her.

10:45.063 --> 10:46.521
Well, you're good at it.

10:46.898 --> 10:49.353
I don't have the patience
to teach the interns.

10:49.526 --> 10:51.981
Well, didn't somebody teach you?

10:52.529 --> 10:54.817
I'm a bit of a lone wolf.

10:57.408 --> 11:00.528
Is it me or does Ragosa
have a thing for you?

11:00.703 --> 11:01.783
He just got divorced.

11:01.955 --> 11:04.872
He's got a thing for everyone.
I'm gonna talk to the parents.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.532
- Let me know when she wakes up.
- Will do.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.914
<i>All on-duty interns, please report
to Nurse Station 4 south.</i>

11:11.089 --> 11:14.588
And when that didn't work,
I used to...

11:15.802 --> 11:18.803
put my mom's cake spatulas...

11:18.972 --> 11:20.798
down my throat.

11:22.725 --> 11:23.923
So...

11:24.853 --> 11:27.178
do you wanna talk to me?

11:29.649 --> 11:31.606
I know it's hard to say out loud.

11:31.776 --> 11:33.318
I know.

11:35.029 --> 11:36.358
But I'm here for you.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.454
I've been...

11:46.499 --> 11:49.998
making myself throw up
since I was 12.

11:55.133 --> 11:56.924
It's so hard now.

11:57.093 --> 11:59.631
I have to dig really deep just to gag.

12:00.430 --> 12:03.347
And you lost, lost hold of the fork.

12:06.269 --> 12:08.807
I really wanna stop, but I can't.

12:11.024 --> 12:13.349
I'm gonna help you, Nina.

12:14.569 --> 12:16.312
And you're going to be okay.

12:18.323 --> 12:20.529
I promise.

12:32.921 --> 12:35.293
So this will be my first time
and I just...

12:35.465 --> 12:37.422
I don't wanna look stupid,
you know?

12:37.592 --> 12:40.509
Like, I've read things,
I've watched things.

12:40.678 --> 12:43.632
I'm afraid if I do anything wrong,
she's gonna laugh. So...

12:43.806 --> 12:45.349
You talk too much.

12:45.517 --> 12:48.008
Yeah, I've been told that before.
Sure.

12:48.186 --> 12:49.597
But you're cute.

12:49.771 --> 12:52.096
And you helped me,
so I'm gonna help you.

12:52.690 --> 12:55.561
I'm gonna give you a lap dance,
a good lap dance.

12:56.736 --> 12:59.607
- No, no, no.
- A $200 lap dance on the house.

12:59.781 --> 13:03.399
You don't need to do that.
Answering questions would suffice.

13:03.576 --> 13:06.862
What'd I say about talking? You won't
shut up because you're afraid.

13:07.038 --> 13:10.905
Women don't like men who are afraid.
Your girlfriend wants a confident man.

13:11.334 --> 13:12.365
Okay.

13:12.544 --> 13:16.078
See what happens when you just
be quiet and let things happen?

13:16.256 --> 13:17.880
Yeah. Quiet. Yes.

13:22.095 --> 13:24.800
Are you just dancing
until you figure out...

13:24.973 --> 13:27.546
- something else to do with your life?
- Mood killer.

13:27.725 --> 13:30.430
- Tell me I look beautiful.
- You look beautiful.

13:30.603 --> 13:34.471
See? That's how you talk
to a woman.

13:35.108 --> 13:36.982
So let me ask you something.

13:37.151 --> 13:39.856
- Okay.
- Can you get me prescriptions?

13:40.154 --> 13:41.779
- I don't know.
- I'd pay for them.

13:41.948 --> 13:43.941
- They're for my urinary infections.
- Okay.

13:44.117 --> 13:47.283
You wouldn't believe how many I get
a year from those nasty poles.

13:47.453 --> 13:49.779
- Yeah.
- Our manager never cleans them.

13:49.956 --> 13:54.665
Each time at the clinic, it's a four-hour
wait just to get a prescription.

13:54.836 --> 13:57.078
So if you could help me,
that'd be awesome.

13:57.255 --> 14:01.668
- What do you take for them?
- Usually cipr... Cip...

14:02.302 --> 14:04.259
Sorry, what?

14:07.182 --> 14:08.557
Oh, gosh.

14:09.225 --> 14:11.218
Ca... Candy? Oh, no.

14:11.394 --> 14:12.675
Help.

14:12.854 --> 14:14.478
Start the FFP.

14:14.647 --> 14:16.806
Knock, knock. He do any talking yet?

14:16.983 --> 14:19.189
Just mumbling.
He's barely conscious.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.068
You were on the scene.
Did he say anything?

14:21.237 --> 14:24.238
- Just a lot of moaning.
- The pilot? Can you describe him?

14:24.407 --> 14:26.613
- Dead.
- Don't be a smart-ass.

14:26.784 --> 14:29.785
- Was he Hispanic or white or what?
- White and dead.

14:29.954 --> 14:34.034
- You notice any other drugs on board?
- It was dark. We're trying to work.

14:34.209 --> 14:36.878
- So if you could just wait outside.
- T, look at this.

14:37.295 --> 14:38.410
What's going on?

14:38.588 --> 14:41.126
His abdomen's filled with blood.
He's gonna need surgery.

14:41.299 --> 14:43.920
Jocelyn, call the OR,
tell them to prep for an ex-lap.

14:44.093 --> 14:46.382
We're gonna go by CT
for a quick chest and head.

14:46.554 --> 14:49.045
You can talk to him post-op,
that'll be a few hours.

14:49.224 --> 14:51.097
Our waiting room is right there.
Okay.

14:51.267 --> 14:52.927
You got your badge? I forgot mine.

14:53.102 --> 14:56.803
Do not fret or be blue.
This badge will get us through.

14:56.981 --> 14:59.733
Yeah, don't worry.
He's in my custody.

15:00.151 --> 15:01.610
I said don't worry. I got it.

15:05.573 --> 15:08.610
- I'm not really sure what happened.
- Keep your hands up for me.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.113
- She's having a stroke.
- God.

15:11.287 --> 15:14.288
- She's paralyzed on the right side.
- Why'd you guys page me...?

15:14.457 --> 15:16.117
- What happened to her?
- She fell.

15:16.459 --> 15:18.167
- She fell?
- Yeah, let's get her up.

15:19.295 --> 15:22.047
- We're gonna take care of you, Candy.
- One, two, three.

15:22.215 --> 15:23.757
I'll get the door.

15:26.553 --> 15:29.672
- How is she?
- We got the fork out, she's stable.

15:29.848 --> 15:31.555
But sleepy from the anaesthesia.

15:31.724 --> 15:33.267
When can we take her home?

15:33.434 --> 15:35.890
I don't think
that she should go home yet.

15:36.312 --> 15:39.598
- Why?
- Nina has an eating disorder, bulimia.

15:39.774 --> 15:42.728
She needs to be treated
with in-patient psychiatric care.

15:42.902 --> 15:46.069
- Our daughter's not crazy.
- I didn't say she was.

15:46.281 --> 15:48.439
- She needs...
- So she wishes she was skinnier.

15:48.658 --> 15:50.152
You know any girls that don't?

15:50.326 --> 15:51.554
She's not missing school
because some doctor's overreacting.

15:51.578 --> 15:53.321
She swallowed a fork.

15:53.496 --> 15:57.660
She's just stressed out from school.
If we need help, we'll call our priest.

15:57.834 --> 16:00.372
Now where do I sign
to take her home?

16:03.089 --> 16:05.627
Hey. This a social visit
or strictly business?

16:05.800 --> 16:08.291
- What do you think, Dwayne?
- That was sarcasm.

16:08.469 --> 16:11.755
- Next time, I'll text it with an emoticon.
- Grumpy tonight?

16:12.182 --> 16:14.886
I'm hypoglycaemic
and I forgot my candy bar.

16:15.059 --> 16:18.310
Here's a fiver for the vending machine.
Knock yourself out.

16:18.479 --> 16:20.139
It only takes ones.

16:21.691 --> 16:23.351
What?

16:25.612 --> 16:27.154
How about some old school?

16:31.284 --> 16:33.656
Hey, Topher.
Let's see your moves.

16:33.828 --> 16:37.197
See if you can keep up
with Baltimore's finest, baby.

16:38.124 --> 16:39.832
- Oh, yeah.
- Go, Thad.

16:40.210 --> 16:42.535
Go, Thad. Go, Thad.

16:42.712 --> 16:43.910
Go, Thad. Go, Thad.

16:44.088 --> 16:45.880
Come on, now.

16:46.216 --> 16:47.544
<i>You're up, Topher.</i>

16:47.717 --> 16:50.338
Jordan, this is Capt. Topher, M.D.

16:50.512 --> 16:52.718
He's a newbie,
so don't expect too much.

16:53.181 --> 16:55.470
Okay. Go.

16:59.604 --> 17:02.177
- What?
- What?

17:07.362 --> 17:10.861
This dance floor I be hoarding
to send love to you, Miss Jordan.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.159
What?

17:15.744 --> 17:18.185
Jordan's gonna fall for this guy.
She's never gonna marry you.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.083
- Oh, you're engaged?
- Well, look, if she says yes.

17:21.251 --> 17:23.824
I'm gonna ask her when I get back.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.374
<i>T?</i>

17:27.840 --> 17:29.169
<i>T?</i>

17:30.510 --> 17:32.752
- T?
- Yeah?

17:33.680 --> 17:35.553
- Little help?
- Yeah.

17:35.723 --> 17:36.886
Yeah, let's do it.

17:37.058 --> 17:38.779
She's gonna be out of it
for a little while.

17:38.935 --> 17:40.844
- What did the MRI Say?
- MRI's clean.

17:41.020 --> 17:43.855
- It doesn't make sense. What's wrong?
- I don't know.

17:44.023 --> 17:47.309
- So, Paul, give it up. What happened?
- Sorry.

17:47.485 --> 17:49.193
She was dancing.

17:49.946 --> 17:53.611
- Dancing?
- But what were you doing in the...?

17:54.534 --> 17:56.573
- You paid her for a lap dance.
- You paid...?

17:56.744 --> 17:59.829
Look, can we just find out
why she's stroking out? Sorry.

17:59.998 --> 18:01.243
Look, see?

18:01.416 --> 18:02.768
Maybe it was all
your built-up virgin pressure.

18:02.792 --> 18:05.248
- Not funny.
- It's Candy's condition's not funny.

18:05.420 --> 18:08.421
You getting a lap dance in the closet
is hysterical.

18:08.590 --> 18:09.870
Give us a heads-up.

18:10.049 --> 18:12.208
I'd cover for you.
Drew can keep a secret too.

18:12.385 --> 18:14.425
There's not gonna be a next time.

18:14.596 --> 18:17.217
You're not gonna tell Jordan
about the lap dance?

18:17.390 --> 18:19.846
I don't think her gyrating on you
is related to her condition.

18:20.018 --> 18:22.224
Let's get her in the room
and run some tests.

18:22.395 --> 18:25.978
Well, you can send the detective over,
but he'll have a long wait.

18:26.149 --> 18:29.849
From what I understand, the patient
is getting a scan, heading to the OR.

18:30.028 --> 18:32.898
Besides, we already have
a DEA agent here.

18:33.072 --> 18:35.610
You wanna talk to him?
Okay, hold on.

18:36.451 --> 18:40.449
Agent Osborne, S.A.P.D. They may wait
a while before they get here...

18:40.622 --> 18:43.373
- but they wanna talk to you.
- No, God, no, no.

18:43.541 --> 18:46.910
My boss will kill me
if I get involved with the locals. No.

18:47.086 --> 18:51.167
I don't wanna get in the middle
of your crap. You hear me?

18:52.133 --> 18:55.585
Hey, listen, we're really busy here.

18:55.762 --> 18:58.763
You can handle all your
jurisdictional stuff when you get here.

19:00.391 --> 19:02.099
Well, then talk to him tomorrow.

19:02.268 --> 19:04.510
I gotta go.

19:10.735 --> 19:15.148
<i>Nurse needed in ICU.
Nurse needed in ICU.</i>

19:24.457 --> 19:27.873
What? What do you mean you can't
put an involuntary hold on Nina?

19:28.044 --> 19:29.787
- Is she an adult?
- No, no, she's 16.

19:29.963 --> 19:31.789
- Is she suicidal?
- No, not yet.

19:31.965 --> 19:35.298
Okay, then. If she is not suicidal,
homicidal, or gravely disabled...

19:36.803 --> 19:40.136
Just so you understand, there's
a stigma against psychiatric care...

19:40.306 --> 19:43.093
in the Latino community.
They tend not to seek it out.

19:43.268 --> 19:45.675
The best I can do
is offer outpatient resources.

19:45.854 --> 19:48.558
- This is just so messed up!
- Yeah, trust me. I get it.

19:48.731 --> 19:52.646
Hey, Krista, you need
to show Dr. De la Cruz some respect.

19:52.819 --> 19:55.392
Yelling at an attending
isn't gonna help your patient.

19:55.572 --> 19:57.363
You're right. I'm sorry.

19:58.032 --> 20:00.072
Isn't there anything you can do
as a chief?

20:00.577 --> 20:02.653
No, and look, I would love to.

20:02.871 --> 20:05.077
You need to learn that
the hardest part of residency...

20:05.290 --> 20:07.033
is that you can't save everyone.

20:07.208 --> 20:10.743
So, what do I tell her?

20:10.920 --> 20:13.874
I promised her
that I was going to help her.

20:14.048 --> 20:16.622
I already spoke to the parents.
I can try again.

20:16.801 --> 20:19.090
- But I wouldn't get my hopes up.
- Okay.

20:19.262 --> 20:22.963
So what did you mean by,
"God knows Drew can keep a secret?"

20:23.141 --> 20:25.513
- We cool?
- Yeah. It was nothing, man.

20:25.685 --> 20:28.093
- I was just kidding.
- Were you?

20:28.271 --> 20:30.596
Because I thought I heard
a little edge in there.

20:30.773 --> 20:33.478
You know, had a little something to it.

20:34.903 --> 20:37.607
Okay, I know this sounds...

20:37.780 --> 20:39.903
Wow, I was about to say gay.

20:40.074 --> 20:42.400
Look, man, I just...

20:43.286 --> 20:45.575
I don't care, man. I really don't.

20:45.747 --> 20:48.452
Rick seems like a cool guy.
I'm glad he's feeling better.

20:48.625 --> 20:51.163
Hey, just spit it out.

20:52.295 --> 20:55.166
Fine. I was pissed
that you didn't tell me.

20:55.340 --> 20:57.795
Quite honestly, I still am. Come on.

20:58.218 --> 21:03.176
It's me, it's me. Dude, I would never
turn my back on you, ever.

21:03.515 --> 21:07.097
Knowing that you felt like
you had to shoulder this whole thing...

21:07.268 --> 21:09.676
by yourself and live a lie
around me?

21:10.605 --> 21:11.885
Man, that kills me.

21:12.857 --> 21:16.309
I just thought we're better
friends than that, that's all.

21:17.612 --> 21:19.106
You're right.

21:20.615 --> 21:22.904
It sounded a little gay.

21:24.410 --> 21:26.617
Come on, man.
You can't take it personal.

21:26.788 --> 21:29.575
It's not about you. It was about me.

21:31.084 --> 21:32.115
It was my thing.

21:32.836 --> 21:35.077
Okay? So we cool?

21:35.755 --> 21:37.130
Yeah, we're good, man.

21:38.091 --> 21:40.249
Stupid face.

21:40.885 --> 21:42.083
All right.

21:42.262 --> 21:46.259
About that Krista situation,
now that she's done bearding for you...

21:46.432 --> 21:48.758
you gonna help me out
with her or not, huh?

21:48.935 --> 21:51.806
I've tried. If you stop playing,
you'd get somewhere.

21:51.980 --> 21:54.103
Playing? I'm not a player.

21:54.274 --> 21:56.065
I'm not a player. I crush a lot.

21:56.234 --> 21:58.061
The OR called. They're ready.

21:58.236 --> 22:00.478
Let's get moving.
Little help, Dwayne?

22:01.197 --> 22:03.273
Hey, is he talking yet?

22:03.449 --> 22:05.442
I'm sorry, agent.
I didn't get your name.

22:05.618 --> 22:07.611
This is a restricted area.
We need to...

22:07.787 --> 22:09.946
- No one's going anywhere.
- Is that so?

22:10.707 --> 22:13.198
- Think I'm playing, doc?
- It's okay.

22:13.376 --> 22:15.499
- Get him talking.
- It's not that easy.

22:15.670 --> 22:18.339
Just do it,
or I'm gonna kill every one of you.

22:18.506 --> 22:20.713
- You don't have to point that.
- What?

22:21.968 --> 22:23.510
How's that?

22:25.722 --> 22:27.382
Dwayne? Dwayne?

22:29.350 --> 22:31.972
- He's dead.
- Well, now I have your attention.

22:37.901 --> 22:41.519
He has a belly full of blood. He's gonna
die if we don't get him to the OR.

22:41.696 --> 22:44.068
Shut up and get over there
against the wall.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.699
And turn around.

22:45.867 --> 22:50.030
I'm gonna have a little conversation
with him and then I'll be on my way.

22:50.580 --> 22:53.153
- Oh, God, Dwayne.
- You, come on.

22:53.833 --> 22:56.122
Shut up over there.

22:58.087 --> 23:00.127
- I'm sorry.
- What?

23:00.298 --> 23:02.456
- I'm sorry.
- You're right, you're sorry.

23:02.634 --> 23:04.959
What are you trying to do,
double-cross me?

23:05.136 --> 23:06.844
Tell me where our money is.

23:07.013 --> 23:08.922
Brownsville.

23:09.098 --> 23:11.091
- Tell me!
- Brownsville.

23:11.267 --> 23:14.019
Hey. Wake up, you bastard.
Come on.

23:14.187 --> 23:15.598
What's the address?

23:15.772 --> 23:17.848
What the hell's wrong with him?

23:18.024 --> 23:19.767
Get over here and make him talk.

23:23.363 --> 23:24.394
Wake him up.

23:24.572 --> 23:26.197
He's losing his pulse.

23:26.366 --> 23:29.367
If you ever want him to speak again,
he needs an OR now.

23:29.536 --> 23:30.911
He's not going to the OR.

23:31.079 --> 23:34.448
I need him to talk for a minute
and then I'll be on my way.

23:34.624 --> 23:35.822
You don't understand.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.491
Blood pressure's dropped
too low for him to wake up.

23:38.670 --> 23:40.378
No, you don't understand.

23:40.547 --> 23:42.919
I vouched for this piece of crap,
okay?

23:43.091 --> 23:46.092
If I don't get what I need
from him, I'm a dead man.

23:46.261 --> 23:49.760
So he dies and you two are gonna join
your friend over there.

23:49.931 --> 23:51.970
I got nothing to lose, pal.

23:52.976 --> 23:55.514
She had all the symptoms
of a left MCA stroke.

23:55.687 --> 23:58.557
Loss of speech, weakness,
but her MRI was normal.

23:58.731 --> 24:00.938
- She collapsed as she was leaving?
- Actually...

24:01.109 --> 24:02.900
Yeah, by the storage room.

24:03.069 --> 24:04.694
She was looking for the restroom.

24:04.863 --> 24:07.354
- What's her status now?
- The symptoms are resolved.

24:07.532 --> 24:10.652
She's having migratory weakness,
loss of vision and speech.

24:10.827 --> 24:13.199
This all started
with a fall on her neck?

24:13.371 --> 24:15.577
- Can you push?
- Yes.

24:15.748 --> 24:17.029
She fell off her pole.

24:17.208 --> 24:21.040
- They are very dirty and slippery.
- Somebody's doing his homework.

24:21.212 --> 24:24.249
It sounds like she has a vertebral
artery dissection.

24:24.424 --> 24:27.341
That's a tear in the wall of the artery
that causes a flap...

24:27.510 --> 24:29.384
that blocks blood flow to the brain.

24:29.554 --> 24:32.638
We order a CT angiogram.
Start on heparin, call vascular.

24:32.807 --> 24:34.136
- Exactly.
- On it.

24:34.309 --> 24:36.882
Don't worry, honey,
we're gonna take care of you.

24:40.231 --> 24:42.271
Hey, bud. It's not your fault.

24:42.442 --> 24:46.226
If you hadn't gotten the lap dance,
she might've stroked out while driving.

24:46.404 --> 24:50.069
You're like our little virgin hero.

24:56.706 --> 24:58.117
What's wrong with his breathing?

24:58.291 --> 25:01.458
The crush injury to his throat
must've caused swelling.

25:01.628 --> 25:04.000
- Well, fix it.
- That's why we need an OR.

25:04.172 --> 25:06.461
You're not going to the OR.

25:06.633 --> 25:08.506
- Not taking that chance!
- We know.

25:08.676 --> 25:11.214
We need to get him tubed
before we lose his airway.

25:11.387 --> 25:12.846
- We're on it.
- Just do it.

25:13.556 --> 25:16.130
We have an ET tube,
but no laryngoscope.

25:16.309 --> 25:19.678
We'll never get it in.
We won't able to see what we're doing.

25:21.898 --> 25:25.397
- What is that? What's the beeping?
- I told you. He needs the OR.

25:25.568 --> 25:28.735
- What are you doing?
- He's going into respiratory failure.

25:28.905 --> 25:31.194
His throat's closed.
We need to breathe for him.

25:31.366 --> 25:33.572
This'll act as a light stylet.
It might work.

25:33.743 --> 25:36.578
Turn down the light.
Do it if you wanna talk to him.

25:36.746 --> 25:39.118
It'll let us see where we are.

25:41.793 --> 25:42.991
Okay.

25:43.169 --> 25:45.209
Come on. Come on.

25:47.465 --> 25:49.837
Let's go. Why is this taking so long?

25:50.009 --> 25:52.797
- Come on. Get in.
- You better not lose him.

25:56.182 --> 25:58.139
You're almost there.

25:58.810 --> 26:01.217
- That's it.
- Advancing the tube.

26:01.396 --> 26:03.388
Okay, good.

26:04.357 --> 26:06.017
Is that it?

26:06.818 --> 26:08.442
Is it gonna work?

26:10.780 --> 26:12.488
- You're in.
- Good. Good.

26:21.249 --> 26:23.123
So when do I get my room upstairs?

26:24.711 --> 26:26.584
You're gonna come visit, right?

26:28.339 --> 26:29.419
I'm sorry, Nina.

26:30.550 --> 26:34.382
Your parents won't let us admit you,
and they wanna take you home.

26:35.346 --> 26:36.722
But...

26:37.140 --> 26:38.515
you can force them.

26:39.684 --> 26:41.511
You're the doctor.

26:42.061 --> 26:43.141
I can't.

26:43.730 --> 26:47.941
I did everything I could think of
to make it happen, but it didn't work.

26:50.069 --> 26:51.694
But you promised.

26:52.405 --> 26:53.983
I shouldn't have.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.820
But I can still help you.

26:59.204 --> 27:03.071
You can come here when I have my
shifts and you can call me anytime.

27:03.249 --> 27:05.954
We can talk, even when I'm off duty.

27:11.049 --> 27:14.584
I'm feeling a little tired.
Can you let me sleep, please?

27:18.431 --> 27:19.594
Yeah.

27:34.113 --> 27:36.521
Cycling pressure.
Systolic's down to 70.

27:37.033 --> 27:38.741
- Sat's 88.
- What's going on?

27:38.910 --> 27:41.282
- Blood pressure and O2 cratered.
- Hanging pressors.

27:41.454 --> 27:43.494
What'd the scans say?
Was it a dissection?

27:43.665 --> 27:46.156
- No, it was clear.
- Then what's causing this?

27:46.334 --> 27:50.498
I don't know. I'll get TC and Topher.
Just start her on high flow oxygen.

27:50.672 --> 27:52.296
Molly, page TC and Topher.

27:59.639 --> 28:02.130
- Any more sutures?
- This is it.

28:02.976 --> 28:04.221
He's on to you, think.

28:04.394 --> 28:07.560
- Have you stopped the bleeding?
- The clips on the folders.

28:07.730 --> 28:09.557
We can use them
to clamp the bleeders.

28:09.732 --> 28:13.267
I need you to either bag
or pull the clips off the folders.

28:13.444 --> 28:14.820
No, you stay right there.

28:14.988 --> 28:17.146
- I'll get the clamps.
- This is a mess.

28:17.490 --> 28:20.064
Yeah. Half his blood volume
is in his abdomen.

28:20.243 --> 28:22.568
- We're out of supplies.
- He's not gonna make it.

28:22.745 --> 28:25.912
That's great. Get all of them.

28:26.249 --> 28:27.280
This'll have to do.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.368
Yeah.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.587
They're looking for us.
Why don't you take off?

28:38.761 --> 28:40.588
Yeah. Okay. Listen to me!

28:40.763 --> 28:43.634
I'm getting sick of your mouth!
Back off, you!

28:43.808 --> 28:47.224
Page them back and tell them
everything's cool. You understand?

28:47.395 --> 28:48.593
Go.

28:49.230 --> 28:52.065
TC and Topher said they're still there.
They'll be down.

28:52.233 --> 28:55.020
- Okay. I'll be in Trauma 3 with Drew.
- Gotcha.

28:55.612 --> 28:56.774
Okay.

28:56.946 --> 29:00.362
Sign here, date there. That states
that you are leaving against advice.

29:00.533 --> 29:04.151
We wish you'd reconsider. We can get
Nina treated and be out in a few days.

29:04.329 --> 29:07.413
- Thank you, but we know our daughter.
- I need a doctor in here.

29:08.666 --> 29:12.118
I came to get her dressed, but she was
unresponsive and hypotensive.

29:12.295 --> 29:14.003
- Nina.
- Nina. Nina, talk to me.

29:14.172 --> 29:15.547
Talk to me!

29:15.715 --> 29:17.921
- I think she swallowed a scalpel.
- What?

29:18.092 --> 29:20.666
- What?
- Molly, get Dr. Alexander, please.

29:20.845 --> 29:22.304
She's gonna vomit!

29:24.140 --> 29:26.014
- Oh, my God!
- Get them out of here!

29:26.184 --> 29:28.093
- Get them out!
- What's happening?

29:33.858 --> 29:35.021
Pressure's up.

29:36.402 --> 29:37.600
Two units running in.

29:37.779 --> 29:39.059
Good.

29:39.239 --> 29:41.611
Opening the fundus now.

29:43.743 --> 29:45.154
Suction.

29:45.328 --> 29:46.656
There it is. I see it.

29:49.249 --> 29:50.363
Easy, Krista.

29:54.754 --> 29:55.999
Nice job.

29:56.172 --> 29:57.797
- Unbelievable.
- I know.

29:57.966 --> 30:00.801
Now her parents will realise
that she has a problem.

30:00.969 --> 30:02.214
Yeah.

30:03.721 --> 30:05.002
Jordan, we need you.

30:05.181 --> 30:06.640
- It's Candy.
- Okay.

30:06.808 --> 30:09.595
Close her up, run in two units
and move her to the OR.

30:09.769 --> 30:11.050
Will do.

30:12.105 --> 30:14.430
Come on, come on.
That looks really bad.

30:14.607 --> 30:18.439
- You need to keep him alive.
<i>- His vitals are dropping.</i>

30:19.153 --> 30:20.185
Stay with me, Thad.

30:20.363 --> 30:21.526
Okay.

30:23.741 --> 30:26.279
Stay with me, Thad. Come on.
Come on. I gotcha.

30:26.703 --> 30:28.363
Hey, Doc?

30:28.538 --> 30:31.705
- What?
- I got an idea. Hand me those clips.

30:34.544 --> 30:37.379
She didn't respond to the pressors
or the high flow oxygen.

30:37.547 --> 30:40.548
She's on 100 percent non-rebreather
her sats are in the 80s.

30:40.717 --> 30:43.504
Send a stat arterial blood gas.
Need her acid/base status.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.000
- On it.
- Where's her chart?

30:46.848 --> 30:49.553
Where are TC and Topher?
They should've been down here.

30:49.726 --> 30:52.181
Could be PE,
but her D-dimer is negative.

30:52.353 --> 30:55.105
It could be an MNI,
but her troponin is negative.

30:55.273 --> 30:57.562
- Could be cardiogenic shock.
- Her echo is normal.

30:57.734 --> 31:00.439
- What the heck?
- That's way too dark for arterial blood.

31:00.612 --> 31:02.770
I know when I'm in a vein
and when I'm in an artery.

31:02.947 --> 31:06.197
It doesn't look like venous blood.
It looks like chocolate.

31:07.076 --> 31:08.986
Go get methylene blue.
Now, now!

31:09.996 --> 31:11.027
Why?

31:11.206 --> 31:14.372
When Candy as giving me a lap dance
she mentioned UTls...

31:14.542 --> 31:16.618
and having trouble to see a doctor.

31:16.794 --> 31:19.332
If she was taking
over-the-counter meds like...

31:19.506 --> 31:21.664
phenazopyridine,
and took too much...

31:21.841 --> 31:23.715
- it would cause...
- Methemoglobinemia.

31:23.885 --> 31:25.878
That explains
the altered mental status...

31:26.054 --> 31:28.509
the stroke symptoms,
and the oxygen level.

31:28.681 --> 31:30.674
That's why she fell off the pole.

31:30.850 --> 31:32.890
Come on. Gotta get this running.

31:39.651 --> 31:41.976
It's working.
It's definitely working.

31:42.153 --> 31:44.062
Paul, did you say "lap dance"?

31:47.158 --> 31:49.234
Are you getting lap dances in my ER?

31:50.954 --> 31:52.827
I need to recheck her vitals.

31:52.997 --> 31:54.456
Jordan, I need you.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.658
We are not done with this.

31:59.337 --> 32:03.169
I gotta hand it to you. I did not think
you had the balls to get a lap dance.

32:03.341 --> 32:05.334
Little boy's growing up, huh?

32:09.013 --> 32:11.504
TC and Topher have been gone
for 45 minutes.

32:11.683 --> 32:13.722
- They're not back from Radiology?
- No.

32:13.893 --> 32:17.973
There's a chemical explosion in Selma.
This place is gonna be swamped.

32:18.147 --> 32:19.262
I'm going up there.

32:23.570 --> 32:25.728
- I'll meet you in the OR.
- Yes, doctor.

32:26.698 --> 32:27.978
Her vitals are stable.

32:28.157 --> 32:32.025
We're moving her to the OR
and we took this out of her stomach.

32:32.203 --> 32:34.243
Is this real enough for you?

32:34.414 --> 32:36.656
- What is she doing?
- Let her do it.

32:36.833 --> 32:40.831
Your daughter is sick
and if you don't admit her...

32:41.004 --> 32:43.542
something like this
will happen again.

32:43.715 --> 32:45.672
Oh, my God, Robert.
Oh, my God.

32:45.842 --> 32:47.585
Just tell us she'll be okay.

32:50.263 --> 32:52.588
We're gonna do our best.

32:56.895 --> 33:00.477
Pretty ballsy. That's the kind of thing
that gets you fired.

33:00.648 --> 33:02.392
I couldn't help myself.
I was so mad.

33:02.567 --> 33:04.939
Good. There's nothing wrong
with being pissed off.

33:05.111 --> 33:08.278
Just remember,
it's not gonna work every time.

33:09.574 --> 33:12.361
Guess I'm just gonna have to get fired
a lot then.

33:14.954 --> 33:16.496
TC, open the door.

33:16.664 --> 33:17.827
Who the hell's that?

33:17.999 --> 33:19.826
Come on, guys,
why is this door locked?

33:20.001 --> 33:22.326
Just get the door and make her go.

33:22.504 --> 33:25.955
- And don't, don't do anything stupid.
- What's going on?

33:26.132 --> 33:28.208
TC, hello? Dwayne?

33:28.384 --> 33:30.044
Move this.

33:34.516 --> 33:36.971
I'm watching you.

33:37.143 --> 33:39.978
What's going on in here?
Why is this door locked?

33:40.146 --> 33:43.183
Yeah, sorry. The guy kept moving,
so we had to scan him.

33:43.358 --> 33:45.849
- Dwayne went to get contrast...
- T, you're bleeding.

33:46.027 --> 33:47.735
- What in the...
- It doesn't...

33:47.904 --> 33:49.528
- Get in here!
- Oh, my God.

33:49.697 --> 33:52.188
Don't move.
Now close the door and block it.

33:52.575 --> 33:54.900
Don't think I won't use it.

33:56.996 --> 33:58.491
Get against that wall now!

33:58.665 --> 34:01.701
- Right there. Right there.
- Okay. I'm going, I'm going.

34:05.255 --> 34:06.832
- Oh, my God. Dwayne?
- Stop it!

34:07.590 --> 34:09.001
- Jordan.
- Take it easy.

34:09.175 --> 34:10.373
It's gonna be okay.

34:16.139 --> 34:19.592
<i>This factory fire in Selma
continues to rage out of control.</i>

34:19.768 --> 34:21.596
Let's clear out the trauma rooms.

34:21.771 --> 34:25.021
I'm setting up rooms
with intubation and chest tube trays.

34:25.190 --> 34:28.726
Have Jordan page me when we know
the number of patients we're getting.

34:28.902 --> 34:31.774
- I will when she gets back.
- She's not back yet?

34:31.947 --> 34:33.608
- Not yet.
- Mr. Ragosa?

34:33.783 --> 34:36.985
- Security's on the line for you.
- Let's go. Let's go.

34:37.161 --> 34:39.569
Yes? Okay.

34:39.746 --> 34:42.237
Put it on the ER Monitor.

34:48.630 --> 34:49.710
Son of a bitch.

34:54.262 --> 34:56.800
Yes, this Michael Ragosa,
San Antonio Memorial.

34:56.973 --> 34:59.049
I need to call in a hostage situation.

35:02.437 --> 35:05.770
- This guy is dead.
- How are we gonna get out of this?

35:05.940 --> 35:08.514
Jordan, look at me.
Jordan, look at me.

35:08.693 --> 35:11.528
We need him to think he's alive.
We gotta trick him.

35:11.696 --> 35:13.024
Hey.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.867
Is he dead?
Because he looks dead.

35:16.034 --> 35:18.572
- No. He's not dead.
- No?

35:18.745 --> 35:21.318
Then why's that thing still beeping,
huh?

35:21.497 --> 35:22.992
And why you pumping his chest?

35:23.166 --> 35:26.333
It means he's got no pulse.
Do you think I'm stupid?

35:26.503 --> 35:29.622
We're working it out. We need
to get the blood up to his brain...

35:29.797 --> 35:31.256
and then we can fix him.

35:31.424 --> 35:33.666
But I need that bag over there.

35:34.886 --> 35:37.294
Get me the bag
if you want him to talk.

35:38.223 --> 35:41.674
- All right. This red one?
- Yeah.

35:44.687 --> 35:46.561
Here's your bag.

35:47.023 --> 35:48.814
Shoot.

35:48.983 --> 35:50.478
- I'll get it.
- You got this?

35:50.652 --> 35:52.027
Just calm down, everybody.

35:54.113 --> 35:56.320
Topher, keep going
with the compressions.

35:56.491 --> 35:58.816
I think we've stopped the bleeders.

35:58.993 --> 36:00.950
Hey, hey.

36:01.412 --> 36:02.575
It's working.

36:02.997 --> 36:04.326
We stemmed the bleeding.

36:04.707 --> 36:07.708
Okay, okay, okay.
But he's still not talking.

36:07.877 --> 36:10.499
- He'll talk. I need time.
- I don't have time.

36:10.672 --> 36:14.005
I need to clamp off the aorta
to get the blood to his brain.

36:14.175 --> 36:16.500
That'll wake him up
and then you can talk to him.

36:16.678 --> 36:20.260
- We got the heart beating.
- It'll work, I've seen it done before.

36:20.431 --> 36:22.590
Okay, all right,
you have five more minutes.

36:22.767 --> 36:24.226
- That's it.
- Perfect.

36:27.105 --> 36:30.308
Ambulances
are two minutes out, people.

36:31.442 --> 36:32.937
Hey.

36:33.319 --> 36:34.814
What the hell is going on?

36:34.988 --> 36:38.072
TC, Topher, and Jordan
are in a hostage situation.

36:38.241 --> 36:42.784
- What?
- Listen. I need you to step up.

36:42.954 --> 36:44.448
Scott is on his way in...

36:44.622 --> 36:48.074
and we have a lot
of victims en route, it is on you.

36:48.585 --> 36:50.209
Okay?

36:51.212 --> 36:54.628
Krista, Paul, come here. You're in
Trauma Three. You're in Trauma Four.

36:54.799 --> 36:57.634
Whatever comes in, you assist on.
You'll see scary things.

36:57.802 --> 37:00.009
- The patient is more scared than you.
- I'm ready.

37:00.180 --> 37:01.887
Jocelyn, you're gonna be with me.

37:02.056 --> 37:05.093
Landry, can you help with intake
and assist them with triage?

37:05.268 --> 37:08.103
Whatever you need.
And, Drew, you got this.

37:08.271 --> 37:09.895
Thanks.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.856
Commander. There are three doctors...

37:16.029 --> 37:18.152
one technician
in the Radiology suite.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.900
This is the man who has them.

37:20.074 --> 37:22.696
My men are ready.
We have to shut down this hospital.

37:22.869 --> 37:24.529
We can't. There's a chemical fire.

37:24.704 --> 37:27.112
Shut down the second floor,
but the ER can't close.

37:27.290 --> 37:28.535
But that's not safe.

37:28.708 --> 37:31.281
We're the only trauma centre
in 10 counties. Victims are coming.

37:31.461 --> 37:34.415
- You gotta figure something else.
- Second floor. Show us.

37:37.592 --> 37:39.585
Around the corner, up the elevator.

37:39.761 --> 37:41.635
I'll be right up.

37:49.938 --> 37:52.725
I think you gotta tell people
what's going on.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.475
Okay.

37:59.656 --> 38:00.936
Oh, man.

38:03.201 --> 38:04.825
I'm not going to lie to you.

38:04.994 --> 38:08.529
There is a possible hostage situation
with TC, Topher and Jordan.

38:09.457 --> 38:11.865
The SWAT team
is here to take care of it.

38:12.377 --> 38:15.543
Okay, okay, now just,
just listen to me.

38:15.755 --> 38:17.582
No matter what you are feeling...

38:17.757 --> 38:21.755
no matter how much we are worried
about them, we have a job to do.

38:21.928 --> 38:24.763
I know it's hard,
but everybody is depending on us.

38:24.931 --> 38:28.881
Let's focus, dig deep, and treat these
people like our own families.

38:29.060 --> 38:30.341
Okay? Let's go!

38:30.520 --> 38:32.678
I got patients with 40 to 50
percent second...

38:32.856 --> 38:35.181
and third-degree burns.
There's more, guys.

38:35.358 --> 38:37.434
- Trauma Three and Four.
- Let's do this.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.982
We're on.
Molly, set up triage.

38:40.154 --> 38:41.814
Trauma Four all the way down.

38:41.990 --> 38:44.777
I need two nurses
in the ambulance bay now.

38:49.998 --> 38:52.915
Mr. Ragosa,
I need you to evacuate this area.

38:53.084 --> 38:54.958
It's almost go time.

38:55.128 --> 38:57.535
We have eyes on the subject.

38:59.090 --> 39:02.174
Nothing's happening
until you review the plan with me.

39:02.552 --> 39:05.921
Those are my guys in there.
I need a medical team standing by.

39:06.097 --> 39:08.386
Okay, we're starting with flash bangs.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.880
What about my team?

39:11.019 --> 39:14.601
- We'll do everything to keep them safe.
- Yeah.

39:15.523 --> 39:19.188
Yeah, listen,
he's not gonna make it.

39:19.611 --> 39:23.193
I just wanna get the hell out of here.
So have a car ready for me.

39:23.364 --> 39:25.322
He's gonna figure out he's dead.

39:25.491 --> 39:27.531
Ragosa has to know
something's going on.

39:27.702 --> 39:31.071
- And if he does?
- We're in here, so just be ready.

39:32.081 --> 39:33.362
What does that mean?

39:33.541 --> 39:36.211
We can't just stand here.
He killed Dwayne.

39:36.377 --> 39:39.378
- He's not gonna let us go.
- Listen up. Change of plans.

39:39.547 --> 39:41.872
- You are coming with me. Come on.
- Take me.

39:42.050 --> 39:44.338
Come on, Missy.
Come on. Now.

39:44.511 --> 39:46.135
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on, Dwayne.

39:46.304 --> 39:49.175
- Stop hogging the MRI machine.
- What the hell's that?

40:06.241 --> 40:07.783
Thad!

40:08.785 --> 40:10.409
T!

40:33.935 --> 40:35.050
Jordan?

40:35.520 --> 40:37.394
- Jordan!
- I'm okay.

40:39.983 --> 40:41.726
Toph?

40:47.574 --> 40:50.325
- Topher!
- Oh, God, Topher.

40:50.493 --> 40:52.865
No, No, no.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.661
Topher! Hey!

40:56.541 --> 40:58.913
Somebody get a crash cart!

40:59.085 --> 41:00.283
Topher, no!

41:06.759 --> 41:07.957
Topher!

41:08.305 --> 41:14.653
