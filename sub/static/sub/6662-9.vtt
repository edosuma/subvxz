WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:08.008
My name is Bridget.
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.551
Just get up
on the stand

00:09.592 --> 00:10.885
and tell the judge
what you saw.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.262
And we'll
protect you.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.014
BRIDGET: I know.
Jimmy's got my back.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.516
I thought I'd be safe.
Turns out, I was wrong.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.561
I ran to my sister Siobhan
for help.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.396
Siobhan? Siobhan!

00:21.438 --> 00:24.899
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.109
It was so easy.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.069
I saw a way out, and I took it.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.405
They all think that I'm her--
her husband...

00:30.447 --> 00:31.990
I want this
marriage to work.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.908
her lover...

00:33.950 --> 00:35.452
Your wife
knows about us.

00:35.493 --> 00:36.786
her best friend...

00:36.828 --> 00:38.371
How long have you been
pretending to be her?

00:38.413 --> 00:39.873
BRIDGET: the only person
I could trust.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.624
This is my friend Malcolm.

00:41.666 --> 00:43.585
You did the right thing
coming here. Come on in.

00:43.626 --> 00:44.961
My best friend is missing.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.379
Her name is Gemma Butler.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.964
And everyone still thinks
Bridget is me?

00:48.006 --> 00:49.382
Don't worry, Siobhan.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.092
The Gemma problem has
been taken care of.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.136
Gemma never had a chance
to tell anybody.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.439
So define "real" vacation.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.316
Hmm.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.817
Well, after everything

01:07.859 --> 01:10.361
you've been through these
past couple of weeks,

01:10.403 --> 01:12.989
I'd say you've
earned someplace warm.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.408
For me, a little bit
of golfing, for you,

01:15.450 --> 01:17.827
I'd assume world-class
beaches are non-negotiable.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.414
I've got it.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.832
Oh, you do, now?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.584
You have to guess.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.127
Um...

01:26.169 --> 01:27.754
Lauderdale?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.339
[laughing] Look if you
didn't want to guess,

01:29.380 --> 01:30.757
you could have just said so.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.550
Tell me.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.512
Turks and Caicos.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.889
Turks and Caicos.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.557
Sounds good to me.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.934
I'll get my assistant
to book it now.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.107
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.526
Fresh from the cleaner's.

01:49.567 --> 01:53.238
Took them long enough, but
they salvaged it somehow.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.489
It's impressive, too,

01:54.531 --> 01:57.951
considering the job
Juliet did on it.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.953
You know, I'd say you're
entitled to some payback.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.496
If you want to take
scissors to

02:01.538 --> 02:02.747
her wardrobe, I'll
turn a blind eye.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.541
Good to know.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.750
Now, where does
this go, up here?

02:05.792 --> 02:07.001
Oh, you know what?
I tell you what.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.378
I, uh, I'll put it away.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.255
It's OK.
I've got it.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.882
No, I'm not taking any more
chances with this dress.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.468
Um, you go make us some
coffee. I'll do it.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.512
Whatever you say.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.381
Wha--Jimmy...?

02:53.423 --> 02:54.591
Lights off!

02:54.632 --> 02:56.050
Damn it, Bridget!

02:56.092 --> 02:58.469
What are you doing?! You
scared the hell out of me!

02:58.511 --> 03:00.638
I had to make sure
no one was watching.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.848
You're not safe.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.516
I'm calling Machado.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.020
Don't. Look, half the Bureau
is on Bodaway's payroll.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.272
You testify against him
tomorrow, you're dead.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.732
You can't trust the Feds.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.442
And I can trust you?

03:12.483 --> 03:15.195
I'm not asking you to trust
me. I'm asking you to run.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.447
-Now.
-I don't have anywhere to go.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.115
You got any family?

03:19.157 --> 03:20.992
A sister.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.119
Go to her. Anywhere
is safer than here.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.545
Take this.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.005
No, I don't want it.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.757
You need protection,

03:35.798 --> 03:37.508
and I need to explain
how you got away.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.510
It's easier
if you just take this.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.304
-I don't like guns.
-Bridget...

03:41.346 --> 03:42.597
No!

03:47.810 --> 03:49.395
[phone line rings]

03:49.437 --> 03:51.481
-Hello.
-Hey. I have a question.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.107
Shoot.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.525
Hmm, funny.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.194
Um, how do I get rid
of a gun?

03:58.905 --> 04:01.783
Something tells me this is
not a hypothetical question.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.326
Afraid not.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.620
It's a cop's gun,
traceable back to my sister.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.538
I can't keep it
in the house.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.165
I thought about throwing it
in the East River,

04:09.207 --> 04:10.708
but with my luck,
it would float.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.752
[Charlie chuckles]

04:12.794 --> 04:14.712
Siobhan, guns don't
float, but they do

04:14.754 --> 04:16.589
have a way
of turning up.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.633
So, unless you're
gonna melt it down

04:18.675 --> 04:20.551
or file off
the serial number,

04:20.593 --> 04:22.512
probably a bad idea.

04:22.553 --> 04:23.805
You want me to
take care of it?

04:23.846 --> 04:25.139
No, I--I couldn't.

04:25.181 --> 04:27.308
I've already used up
all your good will.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.018
You can't max out
good will.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.478
I'll take care of it.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.438
Thank you.
Is Malcolm with you?

04:32.480 --> 04:35.525
No, I left him
at the apartment.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.527
I'm at
the public library

04:37.568 --> 04:41.197
because my computer
went down.

04:41.239 --> 04:45.076
Communal keyboards are
gross, by the way.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.787
But I do have good news for
you on the Gemma front.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.749
A police buddy of mine,
he got her bank statements.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.376
So you're making progress?

04:53.418 --> 04:55.336
Yeah, I'm looking at 'em
right now.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.838
It might take me some time

04:56.879 --> 04:58.548
to make heads
or tails of 'em,

04:58.589 --> 05:00.967
but have no fear,
I will find her.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.636
BRIDGET: Great.
I will see you at NA.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.856
OK, Gemma...

05:14.897 --> 05:16.399
when I take off this tape...

05:19.485 --> 05:22.155
you are not gonna cry...

05:22.196 --> 05:23.656
you're not gonna spit...

05:23.698 --> 05:25.450
and you're not
gonna beg.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.497
You're not gonna
make a peep.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.876
You are gonna shut up...
and eat your bologna.

05:49.640 --> 05:54.604
MALCOLM: I've been kicked around
pretty bad the past few weeks.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.899
After some of the things
I've been through...

05:57.940 --> 06:00.276
it's easy to believe there are
no good people left.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.697
But somebody proved me wrong.

06:06.741 --> 06:11.871
Charlie gave me a place to stay
when I had nowhere else to go.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.123
Got me back in the rooms,
as you can see.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.299
I haven't used in 6 days.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.137
Without Charlie, that wouldn't
have been possible.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.772
Charlie, I really...

06:37.814 --> 06:39.524
No, no, please,
no more thank-yous.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.404
Gotta ask you, though,

06:44.445 --> 06:46.948
how did your sister
steal a cop's gun?

06:46.989 --> 06:48.282
She didn't.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.330
What the hell?

06:54.372 --> 06:55.665
Everything OK?

06:55.706 --> 06:57.291
Yeah. Fine.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.001
You must be exhausted.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.712
What is that bus ride,
16, 17 hours?

07:01.754 --> 07:03.089
Yeah, something like that.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.883
I can't really sleep
on a bus.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.302
Well, get some rest.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.179
Big plans tomorrow.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.893
I don't know how she got it.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.687
I just know I want it gone.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.151
WOMAN: Martin/Charles.
Good morning. May I help you?

07:23.192 --> 07:27.572
See what you got.
Draw me a piggy.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.158
So, what exactly
am I signing again?

07:30.199 --> 07:32.368
They're dividend
reinvestment forms.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.704
I'll spare you
the explanation.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.539
Olivia's been on my ass
to get you to sign them,

07:36.581 --> 07:38.374
but I wanted to give
you time.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.002
I don't mind
the distraction.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.336
Just there.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.800
Oh, oh, Beckett!

07:47.842 --> 07:49.969
Hold on a second,
little buddy.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.929
It's enough that we break
Daddy's stuff,

07:51.971 --> 07:54.265
we're not gonna break
Uncle Andrew's stuff, too.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.975
[chuckles]
It's not a problem.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.768
Oh, good morning.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.605
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.899
Beautiful children.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.821
I thought Gemma's parents
had stepped into the breach.

08:08.863 --> 08:13.034
Unfortunately, Tim's...
he's not doing that well.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.077
ANDREW: Really?
Are things that bad?

08:15.119 --> 08:16.662
Yeah, the doctor says

08:16.704 --> 08:18.748
the stress from
Gemma's not helping.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.875
A bypass last year,

08:20.917 --> 08:23.294
and then a new stent
a couple of months ago.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.213
None of it's working.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.089
Apparently, immortality
is the one thing

08:27.131 --> 08:28.716
Tim Arbogast can't buy.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.141
What?

08:37.183 --> 08:40.186
It's just nice to see you
back on the coffee again.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.647
Wouldn't be rehab without
an 8-cup-a-day habit.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.068
What'd you and Charlie
talk about?

08:47.109 --> 08:49.737
Exchanging
baby-sitting tips?

08:49.779 --> 08:51.405
Come on, Malcolm.
Neither one of us wants...

08:51.447 --> 08:53.324
I'm not complaining.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.618
I needed the help.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.329
And I'm grateful.

08:58.371 --> 09:02.625
Actually, we were, um,
talking about the gun.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.086
I gave it to him
to dispose of.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.462
You really think
it's a good idea

09:06.504 --> 09:08.464
to give up
your only protection?

09:08.506 --> 09:11.008
That's not protection,
that's evidence.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.386
But Bridget will get
blamed if it turns up.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.595
Yeah, and who are
they gonna come

09:14.637 --> 09:16.305
right away to,
asking questions?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.099
It'll only be a matter
of time

09:18.140 --> 09:20.810
before they figured out
that I'm not Siobhan.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.353
You could have
talked to me first.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.397
Don't see why the rush
to give it away now.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.566
I can't have it
in the house anymore,

09:26.607 --> 09:29.652
not when Andrew is
just starting to trust me.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.488
You're pretending
to be his dead wife.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.031
How can there be
any trust in that?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.702
I'm sorry, but this
Prince Charming fantasy

09:37.743 --> 09:39.829
you got going
with Andrew...

09:39.870 --> 09:41.706
it was supposed
to be temporary.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.375
This is not your life.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.627
I know that.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.212
I'm not leaving until
I find out

09:48.254 --> 09:50.339
who was trying
to hurt my sister.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.636
OK, then.
What do you got?

09:55.678 --> 09:57.346
Is there anything you
may not have noticed?

My name is
Siobhan Martin.

♪ ...You're on top

10:41.599 --> 10:44.060

Hi.

10:47.563 --> 10:48.981
Hi!

10:54.028 --> 10:56.947
Felt like a change, I see.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.574
Excuse me?

10:58.616 --> 10:59.992
You usually sit
in the armchair.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.997
It felt like
a couch kind of day.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.168
How are you?

11:09.210 --> 11:12.213
I'm good.
You know, the usual.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.258
And some of
the less usual.

11:18.260 --> 11:22.598
Now, before we begin,
I just have to ask...

11:24.934 --> 11:27.603
why are you calling
yourself Siobhan Martin?

11:36.904 --> 11:39.240
I'm not sure what you mean.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.533
You never use your real name

11:40.574 --> 11:42.118
when scheduling
your appointments.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.746
I didn't realize

11:45.788 --> 11:47.415
I was sleeping
with the boss' wife.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.250
Excuse me?

11:49.291 --> 11:51.168
Is that why you told me
your name was Cora?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.170
Cora...

11:53.212 --> 11:55.756
Cora Farrell.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.842
Discretion has always been
very important to you.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.929
This is the new
Siobhan Martin.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.056
No aliases required.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.183
Well, whatever name
you're using,

12:06.225 --> 12:08.561
I'm glad you decided
to return to therapy.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.688
I am, too.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.481
In fact, I can't
even remember

12:12.523 --> 12:15.484
why I stopped coming
in the first place.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.361
You mentioned something
earlier--

12:17.403 --> 12:21.198
that things were...
"less usual."

12:21.240 --> 12:23.033
Would you like to
talk about that?

12:23.075 --> 12:24.744
How has your life
been different

12:24.785 --> 12:26.537
since we last spoke?

12:29.957 --> 12:34.754
You've never been this
quiet before, Siobhan.

12:34.795 --> 12:38.382
Well... things are
better with Andrew.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.095
And I...I broke it off
with Henry.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.973
And Juliet doesn't
hate me anymore.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.601
Wow.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.853
That is incredible
progress!

12:50.895 --> 12:52.897
You've completely
transformed

12:52.938 --> 12:55.316
your entire life.

12:55.357 --> 12:59.570
And you did all of that
outside of treatment.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.531
Which begs the question,

13:02.573 --> 13:05.493
Why come back now?

13:05.534 --> 13:08.579
I don't understand.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.582
You're repairing all
your major relationships.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.209
You're making strides
in your family life,

13:13.250 --> 13:15.711
and yet,
after months away,

13:15.753 --> 13:17.338
something made you
pick up the phone

13:17.379 --> 13:19.256
and reach out to me.

13:19.298 --> 13:23.052
I--I'm...not really sure.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.678
Well, think about it.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.347
What was different
this morning

13:26.388 --> 13:28.098
than the morning
before?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.059
"Less usual,"
as you put it.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.686
I...I...

13:32.728 --> 13:35.356
can't exactly say.

13:35.397 --> 13:38.776
You came here to explore
something with me.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.196
Something...must've felt
different this morning.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.829
I'll get my assistant
to book it now.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.583
Whatever you say.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.629
Oh, my God...

13:58.671 --> 14:01.382
I'm falling in love
with Andrew.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.718
All over again.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.267
There's too many
tourists that week.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.143
What about the next?

14:13.185 --> 14:16.522
You have the fundraiser gala
for the Carlroy Foundation.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.148
Cancel it.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.358
OLIVIA:
Well, this sounds important.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.985
Olivia.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.946
Unless you're scoping out
tax shelters, this can wait.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.531
Very funny.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.782
Thanks, Claudine.

14:32.538 --> 14:36.250
Now is the time
to hit Arbogast.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.294
We've been down this road.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.087
And you heard Henry.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.923
Tim Arbogast
is weak, sick...

14:42.965 --> 14:46.051
worried about
his legacy.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.636
Wondering who
will take care

14:47.678 --> 14:49.638
of his grandchildren
when he's gone.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.432
Wondering if he's
leaving his money

14:51.473 --> 14:53.851
in the right place.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.812
You and I both know the
right place is with us.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.815
There was a time when

14:59.857 --> 15:01.901
you wouldn't have needed
this much convincing.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.403
What is it, too distracted
planning your next holiday?

15:04.445 --> 15:06.906
Don't accuse me
of losing my focus

15:06.947 --> 15:10.701
just because I don't share
the same urgency.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.453
I'm not shaking down Henry

15:12.494 --> 15:14.204
for his connection
to Arbogast.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.875
Sorry.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.794
How's this for urgent--

15:20.836 --> 15:22.630
two of the six investors
we landed last month

15:22.671 --> 15:24.715
have pulled out.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.467
If we don't score
someone big enough

15:26.508 --> 15:28.677
to cover those losses...

15:28.719 --> 15:30.596
you know what
that could mean.

15:39.188 --> 15:43.025
I mean, the way he looks
at me, it's like...

15:43.067 --> 15:45.736
he can't believe how kind
I'm being to him.

15:45.778 --> 15:50.115
Like, he didn't know I could
ever make him this happy.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.326
I know it's just temporary,

15:52.368 --> 15:56.038
because of how things
were before, but...

15:56.080 --> 15:58.832
I...I don't want it to end.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.293
I...I want to keep
surprising him.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.506
Wait. What's going on?

16:05.547 --> 16:07.174
Time's up.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.384
Wha--it's only been--

16:08.425 --> 16:09.593
An hour 10?

16:09.635 --> 16:12.304
Gave you a little
extra.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.932
Any chance I could just
buy out the next session?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.935
[laughs]

16:17.977 --> 16:21.188
Um...so...

16:21.230 --> 16:23.732
do you think that we should
refill my prescription?

16:23.774 --> 16:25.317
I wasn't planning to.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.361
You seem to be doing
well without it.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.531
So, you don't think
I'm depressed anymore?

16:30.572 --> 16:32.324
Siobhan, you know
I didn't

16:32.366 --> 16:33.534
prescribe those
antidepressants

16:33.575 --> 16:35.077
for depression.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.339
You're doing great,
Siobhan.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.925
I'll see you
next week.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.135
OK.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.930
Thank you. Again.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.157
CHARLIE: Malcolm...
[knock on door]

17:13.198 --> 17:14.408
You OK in there, buddy?

17:17.453 --> 17:19.038
Yeah, I'm OK.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.751
[water splashing]

17:30.007 --> 17:33.969
SINGER: ♪ Oh, oh, oh, whoa ♪

17:41.143 --> 17:43.437
Uh, Charlie...

17:43.479 --> 17:44.980
Yeah, buddy.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.607
You don't have to ask.
Mi casa es su casa.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.317
Knock yourself out.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.527
Kind of what
I'm afraid of.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.280
This has alcohol in it.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.407
Never quite gotten
to the point of

17:55.449 --> 17:58.827
drinking mouthwash to take
the edge off, but, uh...

17:58.869 --> 18:01.872
I don't know if I can risk
being around it right now.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.957
You know what?
No sweat, man.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.168
[chuckles]
Sorry.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.796
Ex-girlfriend, she left it
here a few months back,

18:08.837 --> 18:11.840
and I just never got around
to throwing it out.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.550
Besides...

18:13.592 --> 18:15.135
the blue stuff was never
really my poison.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.607
Wait. Slow down a second.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.567
You're freaking out
over mouthwash.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.152
Bridget, I know.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.612
OK, it's a little
weird,

18:33.654 --> 18:36.031
but not all addicts take
a hard line on mouthwash.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.659
Well, it got me worried
he might be using again,

18:38.700 --> 18:40.119
so, I looked around.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.121
-And?
-Nothing.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.747
I mean, no booze or drugs.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.957
[elevator bell dings]

18:44.998 --> 18:46.667
But I noticed
something else.

18:46.708 --> 18:47.960
I looked through
his drawers.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.378
Dude's got 4 pairs of socks,

18:49.419 --> 18:51.672
4 pairs of boxers,
3 T-shirts.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.258
Malcolm, are you OK?

18:54.299 --> 18:56.677
This isn't about
my sobriety, Bridget.

18:56.718 --> 18:58.846
Something's not right here.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.848
The batteries
in the remote--

19:00.889 --> 19:02.516
they're
still shrink-wrapped.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.476
Charlie says he's
lived here for months,

19:04.518 --> 19:07.271
and he's never used
his remote?

19:07.312 --> 19:09.857
Can we really trust
this guy?

19:09.898 --> 19:11.775
Wait, Malcolm.
I gotta call you back.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.068
I'm right in the
middle of something.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.696
[phone beeps off]

19:18.115 --> 19:19.908
Hi.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.618
I'm so sorry
to bother you.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.828
May I?

19:22.870 --> 19:24.454
The office is closed
for lunch.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.998
You can use the bathroom
on the east wing.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.457
I think I have a key.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.460
I was just over there.
It's really filthy.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.795
Oh.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.213
Thank you.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.420
Siobhan's last session...

20:13.462 --> 20:15.422
[indistinct conversation,
footsteps approaching]

20:19.468 --> 20:21.553
[door opens]

20:21.595 --> 20:23.388
Siobhan?

20:23.430 --> 20:24.765
What are you
doing in here?

20:31.355 --> 20:32.731
I'm calling security.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.941
Please let me explain.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.651
You snuck into my
office, Siobhan.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.152
You violated my privacy.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.779
Oh, I just wanted
to talk some more.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.948
I felt like we were making
such progress this morning.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.241
I didn't want to wait
till the next session.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.450
And I had this crazy dream

20:43.492 --> 20:45.077
that I know has
to mean something.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.579
-I should tell you about it.
-You wanted more time.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.998
You should've called.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.167
I thought therapy
wasn't about judgment.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.506
After an incident
like this,

20:57.547 --> 20:59.091
I'll have to reassess

20:59.132 --> 21:00.926
if we can continue
therapy together.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.928
I completely understand.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.429
Sorry.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.639
MAN: Hold
the elevator, please.

21:07.557 --> 21:08.725
WOMAN: Thank you.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.617
Siobhan went to church?!

21:29.246 --> 21:30.998
Are you going
to call Henry?

21:31.039 --> 21:33.417
I'm still
considering it.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.960
There may be other ways.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.045
And what are those?
Henry's our in.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.673
Without him,
Arbogast is untouchable.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.466
The man's got more handlers

21:41.508 --> 21:43.010
and layers of privacy
and protection

21:43.051 --> 21:44.803
than the President!

21:44.845 --> 21:46.096
I tried getting
his direct line,

21:46.138 --> 21:47.389
and the closest I could
get was the number

21:47.431 --> 21:49.141
of his assistant's
assistant.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.851
You saw Henry.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.020
I lay any more financial
jargon on him today,

21:53.061 --> 21:55.647
and his head will
explode.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.649
Well, if you're not
saving our company,

21:57.691 --> 22:00.527
where are you in such
a hurry to get to?

22:00.569 --> 22:03.488
BRIDGET: Are you ready?

22:03.530 --> 22:05.699
I invited my wife
to lunch.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.547
Did you see the
look she shot me?

22:20.589 --> 22:22.257
Olivia's just got
a bee in her bonnet

22:22.299 --> 22:24.092
about landing Henry's
father-in-law

22:24.134 --> 22:25.886
as an investor.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.804
She doesn't think
I'm acting fast enough,

22:27.846 --> 22:29.473
and she's probably right.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.016
Gemma is still missing.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.728
I know.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.980
And Arbogast's
quite sick.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.442
Which hasn't exactly
gone unnoticed by Olivia.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.486
I think I just
lost my appetite.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.530
[chuckles]

22:45.572 --> 22:46.823
Hey.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.367
I know you don't like
guessing games,

22:48.408 --> 22:50.494
but what about
a thought experiment?

22:51.828 --> 22:54.373
A thought experiment?

22:54.414 --> 22:56.625
I know, I know.
Look, bear with me.

22:56.666 --> 23:00.045
What if all of it
were at stake?

23:00.087 --> 23:02.964
Again, it's not.
It's just an experiment.

23:03.006 --> 23:06.218
What if doing the right
thing cost us everything?

23:07.552 --> 23:09.554
The loft,
the apartment,

23:09.596 --> 23:11.264
the house
in the Hamptons,

23:11.306 --> 23:12.641
the clothes.

23:12.682 --> 23:13.975
Even the sushi?

23:14.017 --> 23:16.561
Even the sushi, yes.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.271
Would you...

23:20.982 --> 23:22.526
would you stand with me?

23:25.695 --> 23:27.739
I'd stand with you.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.749
[sighs]

23:37.791 --> 23:39.876
Look, I've got to get
back to work.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.795
What have you got planned
the rest of the day?

23:44.214 --> 23:49.678
What would you say if I
said I was going to church?

23:49.719 --> 23:51.638
You--in church?

23:51.680 --> 23:52.931
You'd melt.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.141
Hey.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.350
Seriously, Siobhan?

23:55.392 --> 23:56.768
After the fight you put up

23:56.810 --> 23:59.146

What do you
want, a medal, John?

28:06.309 --> 28:08.186
The only reason she had that
gun in the first place

28:08.228 --> 28:10.021
was because the cop you
hired gave it to her.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.690
Yeah.

what changed your mind?

A month ago, I probably
would have done it.

to earn your trust.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.293
But why?

29:57.128 --> 29:59.798
The antidepressants
that Siobhan was on,

29:59.839 --> 30:02.592
they're also used
to treat paranoia.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.719
And the doctor thought
that she was paranoid,

30:04.761 --> 30:07.263
but I think she was scared.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.932
I think maybe she knew

30:08.973 --> 30:10.767
someone was trying
to hurt her.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.310
And then she went to
that bar, and it's

30:12.352 --> 30:13.520
the same bar that
I saw him at.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.355
It can't be
a coincidence.

after Siobhan?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.651
I don't know.

But he's had every chance
to hurt me, but he hasn't.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.825
Maybe because he
knew I had a gun--

30:26.866 --> 30:28.326
which I just gave
to him.

to understand that.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.809

But if you figure it out,
I would love to know it.

has made a sap out of him,

at every turn.

of that.

it, it seemed sensible.

made it your problem.

make it untraceable.

started to pursue.

still missing, and we...

is still out there, I...
