WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:03.711
Previously on 90210:
Annie and I
have a half brother

00:03.754 --> 00:05.631
who was given
up for adoption.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.466
What makes you think you can
even find this person?

00:07.508 --> 00:08.968
I already did.
He's right here.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.428
ANNIE:
He's our half brother?

00:11.470 --> 00:12.638
You still interested in
opening that restaurant?

00:12.680 --> 00:13.889
I'll drop by tomorrow.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.516
You can show me this
amazing waterfront place.

00:15.557 --> 00:16.809
Shirazi, you can
forget about Cronus.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.560
You're done.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.812
I don't need help
from a brother like you.

00:19.854 --> 00:22.439
I don't have to lie, cheat
or scam my way through life.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.816
Wow, you're really a nice guy.

00:23.858 --> 00:24.817
But I got news for you:

00:24.859 --> 00:26.485
nice guys finish last.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.446
ANNIE:
If we're about to do what
I think we both want to do

00:29.488 --> 00:31.657
then we have to finally
get it right.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.450
I think I still love you, Liam.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.370
Liam?

00:36.411 --> 00:38.246
You don't care about what's
important to me, or anyone else.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.165
You only care about
what's important to you.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.376
DIXON (on video):
I figured out a way to make
all of our dreams come true.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.627
I want us to make a music video.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.087
And I want you
to be the director.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.382
LIAM:
I got to find something that
I love and just make it happen.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.133
Dude, I'm telling you,
this thing is so sweet

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
if I had money,
I'd pay for it.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.761
Really?
Yeah.

01:05.024 --> 01:06.901
DIXON:
That was so dope.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.610
The south swell
really filled in last night.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.070
LIAM:
Yeah, that was fun.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.238
I'm glad you guys could make it.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.781
Actually, I wanted
to run something by you.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.115
I've been thinking about
what to do

01:14.157 --> 01:15.450
with that space
beneath the Offshore.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.579
I want to open my own surf shop,
make my own boards.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.247
Oh, man, that's great.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.207
It's a pretty competitive
business though, right?

01:22.249 --> 01:23.375
Yeah, but I got something

01:23.417 --> 01:24.793
that's going to make
my company special.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.170
I design boards...

01:27.212 --> 01:28.463
just for women.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.548
I get to
shape boards,

01:29.590 --> 01:31.926
I get to meet cute girls
at the same time.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.260
Meeting girls?

01:33.301 --> 01:34.762
Well, that's not exactly
a weak part of your game, dude.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.764
Yeah, but after
Ashley and Vanessa,

01:36.805 --> 01:40.642
a simple surfer chick
sounds perfect.

01:40.684 --> 01:41.936
DIXON:
Man, that's smart.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.478
Do what you love,
love what you do.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.022
That's why I
started the label.

01:45.064 --> 01:49.109
Like, I may have just found
the next best female vocalist.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.194
Only problem is, her day job
is having Silver's baby.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.114
Pretty sure pregnant women
can still sing, man.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.240
Yeah, that song
Michaela played

01:55.282 --> 01:56.784
at Mark's opening
was really good.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.368
Yeah, but me
and Silver agreed

01:58.410 --> 01:59.661
that she wouldn't
do any more shows

01:59.703 --> 02:00.829
until after
she had the baby.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.330
Plus, I only have about

02:02.372 --> 02:04.291
six months of money
to keep the label open,

02:04.332 --> 02:06.627
so I have to do a music video
that's career-launching,

02:06.668 --> 02:07.753
like yesterday.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.588
No pressure.
Yeah.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.172
Well, at least you two have
it figured out.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.841
I was hoping this
Cronus Society would hook me up

02:12.883 --> 02:15.010
with some business contacts,
but...

02:15.052 --> 02:16.011
Man, screw them.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.178
Trust me,

02:17.220 --> 02:19.139
you're better off
without those d-bags.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.940
That board is sick.
Where'd you get it?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.775
Um, actually,
I shaped it myself.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.026
Really?
Yeah.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.320
I'm surfing in the Latigo Surf
Festival this weekend.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.363
You think you could make me
a new board for the contest?

02:35.405 --> 02:37.491
Uh, actually,
I think he can.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.701
Especially, considering he
just started his own company.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.203
Um, you want me to take your
board for you, Mr. Court?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.956
Sure.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.333
Yeah, congratulations,
you're my first customer.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.459
(laughing)

02:47.501 --> 02:48.543
Uh, yeah, with your
height and weight,

02:48.585 --> 02:50.754
I'd probably
put you on a quad.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.589
Maybe double concave
with a swallow tail.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.173
I think you'd like how
fast and loose it surfs.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.383
Well, you seem to know
your stuff.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.635
You looking for any investors?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.804
Uh, no, I think I'm going to
keep it small for now,

02:58.846 --> 03:00.388
but, eventually
I'll need some funding.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.890
I might be interested.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.392
Just as long as getting involved
doesn't cut into my surfing.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.435
I don't see why it would.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.021
Cool.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.940
Hey, you know, I've never
actually seen a board shaped.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.650
Can I come by
and watch you work?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.361
Yeah, uh, you can find me under
the Offshore.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.320
Come by tonight.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.405
It's a date then.
Okay.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.533
Later.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.409
It's a date.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.619
Surfboards for girls.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.745
It sells itself.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.747
Hey, the surf festival

03:25.789 --> 03:27.166
could be the perfect
place to launch my company.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.668
Oh, man, I'd
jump all over that.

03:29.710 --> 03:33.212
I-I mean her, uh,
offer, uh, to invest.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.298
No class.
Hilarious.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.595
MICHAELA:
Sure you don't want some?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.556
Oh, yeah.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.807
Like a bowl of
artificial flavors,

03:43.849 --> 03:45.851
a little cancer-causing
dye and a sugar rush?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.936
I'll pass.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.188
Silver, I promise you,

03:49.229 --> 03:50.397
no matter
what comes along--

03:50.438 --> 03:52.816
whether it's a music
career, a cute boy--

03:52.858 --> 03:54.526
I will always
put your baby first.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.610
Hm.
Really.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.862
But just so you know,

03:56.904 --> 03:58.405
I'm not going to stop
eating my favorite cereal

03:58.446 --> 03:59.907
until after I'm
actually pregnant.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.449
(laughing):
Fair enough.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.205
Sweet, both of
you guys are here.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.414
So, I have some news

04:07.455 --> 04:09.208
that's going to change
all of our lives.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.001
You're pregnant, too?

04:11.043 --> 04:12.586
I'm so happy
for you.
Really?

04:12.627 --> 04:14.629
Really, guys?
(laughing)

04:14.671 --> 04:17.216
No, uh,
remember our music video?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.466
It's on.

04:18.507 --> 04:19.676
A movie just
lost its funding,

04:19.718 --> 04:21.178
the guy at the
studio called me,

04:21.220 --> 04:23.805
told me we could have all
of their sets for half price.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.682
We just have
to shoot the day after tomorrow.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.808
Don't I need a song?

04:26.850 --> 04:27.935
You have a song.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.811
I'll just put together
a new mix for the song

04:29.853 --> 04:30.979
that you did at the Offshore.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.355
We'll be good to go.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.523
Look, after we do this video,

04:33.565 --> 04:35.109
I'll have everything I need
to launch Michaela

04:35.150 --> 04:36.276
before she goes into mommy mode.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.611
Okay, that
sounds amazing,

04:37.652 --> 04:40.197
but Michaela has a checkup
for her IVF tomorrow.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.490
Okay, but didn't you
say the appointment

04:42.532 --> 04:44.243
was just for lab tests?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.953
Well, we'll shoot the video,
have everything done

04:45.994 --> 04:47.162
before she's even implanted.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.747
Look, I'm telling you,

04:48.789 --> 04:51.291
if we miss out on these sets,
I don't even know when

04:51.332 --> 04:53.001
we'll get another opportunity
like this.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.920
Sounds really cool.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.046
(sighs)

04:56.088 --> 04:57.839
Not that anybody's
asking what I think.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.050
I'm just the singing womb.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.138
Come on, please.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.266
Okay, let's do it.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.225
Yes!

05:08.267 --> 05:09.684
Yes, perfect.
(laughing)

05:16.524 --> 05:18.944
Mmm, so delicious.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.198
Oh, that is good

05:23.240 --> 05:24.365
(laughing):
Told you.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.951
Me next, me next.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.706
Mmm. Mmm.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.916
Sorry, that's it.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.168
All done.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.836
Well, that
was incredible.

05:35.877 --> 05:36.878
Your food is amazing.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.880
I'm glad you liked it.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.090
That's why I wanted you
to be blindfolded,

05:40.132 --> 05:41.549
so you could focus
on just the taste.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.135
Well, it was better
than sex, if you ask me.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.845
Really?
Maybe.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.930
It depends who
you're having sex with.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.389
Okay.

05:48.431 --> 05:51.852
Enough with the images
of food and sex.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.979
Well, in any case,
it's superb, as usual.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.148
Are these the new menu items
for the Offshore?

05:56.190 --> 05:57.816
Not exactly.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.900
Annie's hedge fund guy

05:58.942 --> 06:00.277
does business with the
owners of Bijou.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.196
Turns out they're
looking for a new chef.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.697
So, Annie pulled some strings

06:03.738 --> 06:05.157
and now I'm flying
to New York next week

06:05.199 --> 06:06.574
to cook for them
what you just tasted.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.076
(Adrianna giggling)

06:08.118 --> 06:09.203
Excuse me, New York?

06:09.244 --> 06:11.370
It's a three-star rated
Michelin restaurant.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.081
Isn't that
so exciting?

06:13.123 --> 06:15.083
Uh, no, it absolutely is not.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.417
Yes, I ate at Bijou last
time I was back East.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.752
It is amazing.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.838
In fact, New York is amazing.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.131
I could live there in a second.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.008
The Guggenheim,
Broadway theater?

06:23.050 --> 06:25.468
The Guggenheim's
my favorite museum.
Yeah?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.469
And New York is
such a great city.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.595
I love New York, too.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.764
I, for one, don't know why
anyone would move there.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.308
I mean, it's a smelly,
roach-infested city

06:31.350 --> 06:32.851
that, last time I checked,
was halfway under water.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.354
Okay, well, don't
candy-coat it, Naomi.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.604
Tell us how
you really feel.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.941
I just thought you were
happy with the restaurant.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.609
Oh, I am.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.111
And the Offshore is off
to a great start,

06:43.153 --> 06:45.572
but most new restaurants
fail in first year.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.991
That's just the reality
of the business.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.617
Don't worry, I'll find
someone to take over Offshore,

06:49.659 --> 06:52.871
but this opportunity...
it's a once-in-a-lifetime deal.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.166
So, who's up
for dessert?

07:01.588 --> 07:03.590
Well, if it
isn't everybody's

07:03.631 --> 07:05.717
favorite
backstabbing traitor.
(sighs)

07:05.759 --> 07:07.594
Oh, what do
we have here?

07:07.635 --> 07:09.930
"Major global
marketing firm

07:09.971 --> 07:11.765
looking for trainee
on business track."

07:11.806 --> 07:12.891
Yeah, what do
you want, Campbell?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.143
I'm always interested
in a good opportunity.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.312
Maybe this
should go to someone

07:17.354 --> 07:18.980
who actually is
a Cronus member.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.481
Mm-hmm.
Plus, it says here

07:20.523 --> 07:22.734
only serious
applicants need apply.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.695
I don't think you
could hack it, Shirazi.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.156
I can take care of myself.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.077
We'll see about that,
won't we?

07:36.164 --> 07:37.874
Okay, what the hell was that?

07:37.916 --> 07:40.085
You mean Ade
power-flirting with Mark?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.003
Oh, "Look at me, I want
to have sex with your food.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.422
I love New York."

07:43.463 --> 07:46.507
Um, no, you trying to get
Mark to move to New York.
What?

07:46.549 --> 07:50.304
Naomi, Bijou is one of the
best restaurants in the world.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.471
You weren't seriously
expecting him to pass that up

07:51.512 --> 07:52.597
to stay at
Offshore, are you?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.308
Well, I didn't
spend all that time

07:54.349 --> 07:56.810
trying to find our brother
only to have him move away.
(scoffs)

07:56.851 --> 07:58.645
I'm tired of all the men
in my life leaving.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.105
Is it too much to hope
that one of them will stay?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.190
Well, it's not for
sure that he's leaving.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.150
We both tasted his food.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.985
They'd be
idiots not to hire him.

08:05.026 --> 08:08.905
Unless someone
gives him a reason to stay.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.866
Someone who is passionate about
his cuisine and sex.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.661
Oh, no, no, no,
not Mark and Ade.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.912
But I thought you and
Adrianna were fine?

08:15.954 --> 08:17.497
I love Ade,
but not for Mark.

08:17.538 --> 08:20.041
Oh, okay, so
I can't decide

08:20.083 --> 08:21.709
where Mark goes, but you
get to decide who he dates?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.462
Because I am just
trying to help him,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.088
and you are
helping yourself.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.757
Just because you have a
clever way of saying it

08:27.799 --> 08:29.134
doesn't make it right.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.510
Okay, you know what?

08:30.551 --> 08:32.804
There is no point
in arguing about any of this,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.931
because in the end,
it's Mark's decision.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.393
Where and how
he lives his life

08:38.434 --> 08:40.270
is entirely up to him.

08:40.312 --> 08:44.274
So, you and I
should both promise

08:44.316 --> 08:46.026
that we're going
to stay out of it.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.194
(scoffs)

08:47.235 --> 08:49.363
Thank you for being
the voice of reason.
Hm.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.947
I promise I
won't force Mark

08:50.989 --> 08:52.449
to do anything he
doesn't want to do.
Yeah.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.408
You need to go.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.617
Drive safe.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.661
(scoffs quietly)

08:58.955 --> 08:59.914
(sighs)

08:59.956 --> 09:02.209
Ade, you naughty girl.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.177
Hey.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.178
Just building your board.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.138
Ah, don't stop,
I like watching you.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.519
I start with the outline curve,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.312
and then I
build in the rocker,

09:22.354 --> 09:23.397
which is the bend in the board.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.565
It's what
gives it its character.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.108
Come here,
check it out.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.695
So, you make or
break the board

09:30.737 --> 09:32.613
in the finish sanding. By hand.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.948
Can I try it?

09:33.990 --> 09:35.700
Yeah.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.499
You have to be precise.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.211
Softening the rail.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.672
Adding the subtle concave...

09:52.551 --> 09:53.927
...that will give it
its speed and drive.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.225
See, what you
need is a board

10:00.267 --> 10:03.562
that's built just
for your body type.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.022
Unique...

10:06.064 --> 10:07.232
and personal.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.611
You're pretty good at this.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.281
I think I'm making
a smart investment.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.033
Then I better
not let you down.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.127
(theme music playing)

10:44.269 --> 10:46.104
Thank you so
much for doing this.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.022
I needed to find a new suit
for this weekend's surf event.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.357
Well, it's your lucky day.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.192
My event client just
released this new line.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.403
Isn't it fabulous?
(laughing)

10:53.445 --> 10:54.446
Speaking of fabulous,

10:54.488 --> 10:56.739
how great was
last night's food?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.658
My God, your brother is,
like, the best chef ever.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.867
I know, right?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.035
Oh, my gosh.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.912
And it totally seemed
like you were into him

11:02.954 --> 11:04.331
last night, too.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.373
(both chuckle)

11:05.415 --> 11:06.583
Really?
Was it that obvious?

11:06.625 --> 11:07.834
Well...

11:07.875 --> 11:09.628
I guess I was
kinda crushing.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.671
I don't know. I feel like
he liked Silver, though.
Uh, no.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.800
I mean, Silver's great.
No, I just don't really think

11:15.842 --> 11:17.511
changing diapers is on
Mark's to-do list.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.847
(chuckles)
Besides, he... Oh.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.183
Uh, no, I really shouldn't.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.392
No. What?

11:24.434 --> 11:25.977
Well, it's just...

11:26.019 --> 11:31.274
Okay, when Mark was leaving,
he kind of said

11:31.316 --> 11:33.193
he definitely is attracted
to you and thinks

11:33.234 --> 11:35.945
that you have the most amazing
eyes he's ever seen in his life.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.738
I do have amazing eyes.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.824
I never told you that.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.160
Annie made me swear
that I wouldn't meddle
in his love life.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.662
Promise.
Okay.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.913
(doorbell rings)
Oh, you know what?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.541
Um, that one-piece is not really
doing it for you.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.669
Why don't you try
this on?

11:50.709 --> 11:52.128
Okay.
(both chuckle)

11:52.170 --> 11:53.712
MARK:
Hello? Naomi?
Hi.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.216
I got your text
and came right over.
What's going on?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.843
Thank you so much.
It's my stupid printer.
It has this

11:58.885 --> 12:00.470
terrible glitch, and I can't
seem to work it out.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.639
You're a borderline blue collar
fix-it kind of guy, right?

12:02.681 --> 12:03.931
You can take a look?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.809
Sure. I don't know much
about computers, though.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.271
Whoa.
(chuckles)

12:10.313 --> 12:11.772
Oh, my God.
What time is it?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.941
I have a client meeting
that I'm late for.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.776
Can show you please show Mark
where the printer is?

12:15.818 --> 12:18.363
Thank you so much. Bye.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.366
It's this way. Follow me.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.336
So, I see you have incomplete
transcripts from C.U.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.462
Why no grades?

12:34.504 --> 12:36.339
All the undergrads had grades
held up

12:36.381 --> 12:37.674
this semester for some reason.

12:37.716 --> 12:41.386
Well, I can assure you
I'm a straight-A student.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.555
I take my academics
very seriously.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.974
You transferred from Princeton
to C.U.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.227
Not exactly an obvious academic
trajectory.

12:49.269 --> 12:53.690
I had a good friend pass away,
and some other personal stuff.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.526
So I ended up getting the chance
to stay close to home.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.655
You're not a mama's boy,
are you, Shirazi?

13:00.697 --> 13:02.990
Excuse me?

13:03.032 --> 13:04.618
Our marketing trainee program

13:04.659 --> 13:05.784
is purposefully rigorous

13:05.826 --> 13:07.704
because we plan to hire you
when you graduate.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.873
I'm looking for someone
who's gonna kick a little ass.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.417
I certainly don't need anyone

13:12.459 --> 13:13.918
who is wrestling
with personal stuff.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.712
(chuckles)

13:15.754 --> 13:19.215
So, Shirazi, are you a mama's
boy or an ass kicker?

13:19.257 --> 13:22.594
For this opportunity,
I'd kick my grandmother's ass.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.472
I like your spirit.
But I have to be honest,

13:25.513 --> 13:27.557
on paper you look like a dog
with fleas.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.808
Okay, if you just give me
a chance...

13:29.850 --> 13:32.186
I'd like to, but we
only take on people

13:32.228 --> 13:34.773
with real marketing experience.

13:34.855 --> 13:38.067
You need to be familiar
with product launches,

13:38.109 --> 13:41.571
financial backing, branding.
I just don't see that here.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.574
Thank you. Uh...

13:46.785 --> 13:48.077
Thank you for your time.

13:48.119 --> 13:51.456
Any chance that you and your
daughter would like

13:51.498 --> 13:53.958
two VIP passes to the Latigo
Surf Festival this weekend?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.961
Yeah, sure.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.798
Great.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.341
(phone rings)

14:01.382 --> 14:03.677
Hello.

14:03.718 --> 14:04.969
Yep, hold on.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.596
It's for you.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.930
Some breathy chick named Sydney.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.017
Tell-tell her I'm not here.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.560
Just-just...

14:12.602 --> 14:16.189
Okay. Actually, I was wrong.
He's not here.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.065
Sure, I'll tell him.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.026
(phone beeps)

14:20.067 --> 14:22.236
It's-it's this woman who wants
to invest

14:22.278 --> 14:23.863
in my surfboard company.

14:23.904 --> 14:24.947
And you're dodging someone

14:24.989 --> 14:26.533
who wants to give you money
because...?

14:26.574 --> 14:28.576
Because it's not that simple.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.828
I really like her.

14:29.869 --> 14:34.165
And things kinda got out of hand
and we hooked up.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.462
Yeah, I know. Bad idea, right?

14:39.504 --> 14:43.174
I am probably the wrong person
to be talking to about this.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.177
But I will say the last time you
mixed business and romance

14:46.219 --> 14:48.847
it didn't go so well.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.891
Hi.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.518
I though you were supposed to be
at work at the Offshore.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.019
I know, I'm running late.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.689
Naomi texted me 911 to help
with her big printer emergency.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.358
Turns out the emergency
was that the printer was
unplugged from the wall.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.694
Do you believe that?
Dude, what a waste of time.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.071
It was, unless you count
seeing Adrianna

15:05.112 --> 15:06.322
parade around in a bikini

15:06.364 --> 15:08.282
as a waste of time,
which I do not.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.950
So let me get this straight.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.119
Naomi called you over to fix
her unbroken computer

15:12.161 --> 15:15.122
and Adrianna just happened
to be there strutting around

15:15.164 --> 15:16.750
in a very skimpy bathing suit?

15:16.791 --> 15:18.084
Pretty much.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.001
(scoffs)

15:19.043 --> 15:21.796
So, is Adrianna seeing
anyone right now?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.130
Not that I know of.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.341
Oh, well, that's probably
because she's been

15:25.383 --> 15:27.218
kind of a hot mess lately.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.929
Perfect.
I kinda like me a hot mess.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.641
(sighs)

15:33.683 --> 15:35.602
♪ Waiting for ♪

15:35.643 --> 15:37.604
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh ♪

15:37.645 --> 15:39.898
♪ So keep your eyes on me ♪

15:39.980 --> 15:43.568
♪ We're almost there ♪

15:43.610 --> 15:45.904
♪ Yeah. ♪

15:45.945 --> 15:47.655
(music stops)

15:47.697 --> 15:50.784
And cut it!
Yes! Yes!

15:50.825 --> 15:52.535
Thank you.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.994
What do you think?

15:54.036 --> 15:55.622
Well, I think it's
gonna look great,

15:55.663 --> 15:57.582
especially after we add
the other 60 dancers tomorrow.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.333
60 more dancers?
Dixon, we don't need it.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.752
It's gonna be
too expensive.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.671
Well, I think we passed
expensive about

16:03.713 --> 16:04.964
$20,000 ago, okay?

16:05.005 --> 16:07.174
Look, I told you
this is gonna be huge, okay?

16:07.216 --> 16:08.927
Silver, I love what
you're doing.
Thanks.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.221
Michaela sounds great,
the dress looks even better,

16:12.263 --> 16:14.599
Thank you.
and the song is off the hook.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.975
Yeah, he's right.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.727
I think what the three of us are
doing is really amazing.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.979
Yeah.
(phone rings)

16:20.020 --> 16:22.064
I bet you that's
the future calling

16:22.106 --> 16:23.566
saying, "Welcome to
the big time."

16:23.608 --> 16:26.319
Or my bank calling
to repossess my car.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.738
Hey, I'm not gonna let you
start worrying, all right?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.072
That's Silver's job.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.450
Silver worries about her baby,
I worry about mine.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.201
This video's our baby, Dixon.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.787
Look, you heard her.
This whole thing,

16:35.829 --> 16:37.914
it's gonna be huge
for all three of us.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I guess you're right.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.544
MICHAELA:
Yeah.

16:43.586 --> 16:48.090
Um, that was
the fertility clinic.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.092
They just got your latest
hormone test back.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.637
We need to move up
the IVF procedure.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.682
Uh, okay, to, to when?

16:55.723 --> 16:57.308
Tomorrow.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.268
Tomorrow? Really, Silver?

16:59.310 --> 17:01.729
Oh, wow.

17:01.771 --> 17:05.191
Okay, all right,
so what does this mean?

17:05.232 --> 17:06.275
We can postpone the music video.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.194
We can't. I'm all in here.

17:08.234 --> 17:11.405
The cast, the crew,
the equipment.

17:11.446 --> 17:14.116
If we postpone anything,
I'm screwed.

17:14.157 --> 17:16.577
There's nothing we can do,
Dixon. I'm so sorry.

17:16.618 --> 17:20.580
Look, Silver,
I'm happy for you, okay?

17:20.623 --> 17:21.665
I-I really am.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.084
But sorry isn't much help
to me right now.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.141
Hey! Oh, man, these look great.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.227
Yeah. I'm psyched. My company

17:41.268 --> 17:42.979
actually has a chance
to do well.

17:43.021 --> 17:46.357
Yeah, About that, um, I wanted
to ask you a little favor.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.610
I want to head up the marketing
for your surfboard company.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.446
Marketing? Uh, I just plan on

17:52.488 --> 17:54.532
throwing a few boards
on the beach.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.285
Okay, listen, I just blew an
interview for a trainee position

17:58.327 --> 18:00.830
because I have zero marketing
experience.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.708
Way to sell yourself
as my new head of marketing.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.711
But on my way out the door,
you know, I thought on my feet.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.380
So I invited the guy and his
daughter to the surf festival.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.299
He can see me in action
promoting your surfboards.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.094
Liam, please, I really need
to impress this guy.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.721
Plus, I want to land this job

18:16.763 --> 18:18.222
and then put the karmic
smack-down

18:18.264 --> 18:19.891
on Campbell and his snob squad.

18:19.933 --> 18:24.270
Okay. Yeah, I wanted to open
a business.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.271
Why not go big?

18:25.312 --> 18:27.023
Yeah? Dude, thank you so much.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.985
Hey, I-I promise you I will
transform the Offshore

18:31.027 --> 18:33.029
into complete deluxe
hospitality suite.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.864
I'm talking board displays,

18:34.906 --> 18:36.407
press materials,
the works.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.034
Oh, and that cute investor
of yours,

18:38.076 --> 18:39.577
she'll make our
company totally legit.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.870
(inhales sharply)

18:40.912 --> 18:43.539
Yeah, that could be
a problem.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.207
I kinda slept with her.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.543
You banged
the only potential investor

18:47.585 --> 18:49.253
you had
for your fledgling company?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.714
In this economy?

18:51.756 --> 18:54.050
Well, I wasn't thinking
about the financial
climate at the time.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.969
Well, you need to start if we're
doing business together.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.762
I mean, the last time you mixed
business with romance...

18:57.804 --> 19:00.723
I know! I know. Annie already
talked to me about it.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.934
I guess I just need
to decide if I want

19:02.976 --> 19:05.937
my relationship with Sydney
to be personal or professional.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.564
Okay. Let me help you
out with your decision.

19:08.606 --> 19:11.233
There will be a hundred women
in bikinis

19:11.275 --> 19:12.568
on the beach tomorrow, okay?

19:12.610 --> 19:15.195
Only one of them wants
to invest in your company.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.197
Date the other 99.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.619
(playing soft chords)

19:25.915 --> 19:26.958
You're back.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.170
Yeah. The IVF procedure
went really well.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.798
And we'll know in a few days
if she's actually pregnant.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.842
In the meantime,
the doctor wants
me on bed rest

19:35.883 --> 19:38.511
for the next 24 hours,
so if you'll excuse me,

19:38.552 --> 19:41.848
I have a date
with the TV remote.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.433
I'll make you some tea.
Thanks.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.685
You want some?

19:45.726 --> 19:48.146
No. Uh, actually no.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.648
I have to go wrap out
the studio.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.026
Um, look,

19:53.067 --> 19:54.777
before you go, uh,

19:54.819 --> 19:58.114
I want to thank you for being
so understanding about all this.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.658
Yeah, well, I don't really have
much of a choice, do I?

20:00.700 --> 20:04.120
Dixon, we'll put the music video
back together...

20:04.162 --> 20:06.998
Silver, I had to eat the cost
of the crew and equipment.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.750
There's no way that the label
can afford a do over.

20:09.792 --> 20:14.380
I'm sorry, Dixon.
I'm so sorry about this.

20:14.421 --> 20:17.175
But you know that I didn't plan
for this, right?

20:17.216 --> 20:20.720
I know. Silver,
I can't blame you.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.638
It's all on me.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.725
See, I took a risk because
I have a dream

20:25.766 --> 20:27.393
of having a music career.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.021
But you have a dream
of having a kid

20:30.063 --> 20:32.648
and beating cancer.

20:32.690 --> 20:35.359
How can I compete with that?

20:38.946 --> 20:40.781
Seriously, I gotta go.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.743
You're not actually mad at me,
are you?

20:43.784 --> 20:48.122
No, Silver, I'm not.
I don't get to be.

20:48.164 --> 20:51.584
And you know what?
That's what's so frustrating.

20:51.625 --> 20:56.589
It's unfair! And now I feel like
a jerk for even saying that.

20:58.716 --> 21:02.386
Look, sometimes somebody has
to lose out.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.847
In this case, it's me.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.392
(sighs)

21:11.104 --> 21:14.148
To promise.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.984
Defined as "a declaration
or assurance that one will do

21:17.026 --> 21:19.862
a particular thing
or a particular thing
will happen."

21:19.904 --> 21:22.115
Thank you, Annie.
I know what a promise is.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.950
Oh, really? So what happened
to our promise

21:23.991 --> 21:26.410
not to get involved with Mark's
life? You lied to me!

21:26.452 --> 21:29.663
No, you said it wasn't worth
arguing about,

21:29.705 --> 21:31.999
and it was Mark's decision,
to which I agreed.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.709
I didn't force Mark
to do anything.

21:33.751 --> 21:37.337
I merely, like you,
gave him a few other options.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.090
Mm.
Hey, Annie!

21:39.132 --> 21:40.258
Hey, Naomi.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.843
I'm heading to the
Offshore to meet Mark.

21:42.885 --> 21:43.803
In that?

21:43.844 --> 21:45.429
Ugh! I know, I feel
kind of silly.

21:45.471 --> 21:48.224
I'm the shot girl and Liam's
celebrity spokesperson

21:48.266 --> 21:50.101
at their hospitality suite
at the surf festival.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.602
I'm gonna go show them
my costume.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.021
Naomi helped create it.
Mmm...

21:54.063 --> 21:54.897
See ya.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.274
NAOMI:
Have fun.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.526
You... have... no... shame.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.654
It's not my fault
that Ade is smoking hot

22:01.695 --> 22:03.823
and Navid and Liam hired her

22:03.864 --> 22:06.951
as their pseudo-celebrity
spokesperson for a little event

22:06.993 --> 22:09.120
that our brother happens
to be cooking at.

22:09.162 --> 22:12.331
Are you seriously gonna deny
having anything to do with this?

22:12.372 --> 22:14.625
You're obviously
manipulating Mark

22:14.667 --> 22:16.335
and interfering in his business.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.503
So typical.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.255
Whatever Naomi wants,
Naomi gets.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.465
You're right, it is typical.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.050
Typical Annie.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.677
"Posing" as a do-gooder.

22:24.718 --> 22:25.761
(chuckles)

22:25.803 --> 22:27.221
When you're really
just controlling

22:27.263 --> 22:29.182
and smothering Mark
the same way you do Dixon.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.892
This coming from the bitch

22:31.934 --> 22:35.313
who does nothing but meddle
in everyone's life.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.731
We all know
it's why you lost Max.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.819
You did not just go there.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.529
Oh, I did.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.739
Well, I will not lose Mark

22:45.781 --> 22:47.908
because I'm not gonna
let him move to New York.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.410
Well, I will not let you
ruin his life

22:50.452 --> 22:51.829
by denying him this opportunity.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.165
I'm warning you now,

22:54.207 --> 22:56.167
this could cost you
our friendship.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.376
Well, you know what?

22:58.418 --> 23:02.548
Maybe I'd rather lose one
friendship over my only brother.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.604
SYDNEY:
Liam!

23:17.646 --> 23:19.357
Liam, the board

23:19.439 --> 23:21.317
goes so good.
I'm through to the finals.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.443
Yeah? I'm stoked you like
the board.
Yeah.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.488
Well, I like more
than the board.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.406
I think our company is
gonna be huge.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.658
Why don't you come by tonight,

23:29.700 --> 23:31.160
and we can talk
about our business plan.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.453
Yeah, um, about that.

23:33.495 --> 23:36.290
I don't think this
is gonna work out.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.585
This,
meaning our surfboard business,

23:39.626 --> 23:41.712
or this,
having to do with us hooking up?

23:41.754 --> 23:45.966
Look, I've mixed relationships
with business before,

23:46.008 --> 23:48.677
and it didn't turn out so good.

23:48.719 --> 23:50.221
I really like you,
but we either need

23:50.263 --> 23:51.597
to work together
or date each other.

23:51.638 --> 23:54.058
Well, um,

23:54.100 --> 23:57.061
I definitely don't want
to date you.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.980
Liam, I'm married.

24:00.022 --> 24:02.024
What?

24:02.900 --> 24:05.485
He's a much older guy.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.612
I was foolish

24:06.653 --> 24:08.530
and impulsive,
and I made a mistake,

24:08.572 --> 24:13.244
and I'm in the process of trying
to fix that mistake.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.453
Look, I know that it all
sounds complicated,

24:15.495 --> 24:17.248
but we don't have to be.

24:17.290 --> 24:20.000
We can keep it casual
and have fun.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.920
I'm sorry,
but you being married...

24:24.297 --> 24:25.923
I don't think I can do that.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.926
Then I'm sorry, too.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.722
I'll see you around, Liam Court.

24:39.437 --> 24:42.356
SILVER:
Dixon, hey.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.317
Where you going?

24:44.358 --> 24:45.651
I'm going home.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.320
I had a shocker
and lost my first heat.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.486
Whatever, I'm over it.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.738
Just come on.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.031
Don't leave yet, all right?

24:51.865 --> 24:53.033
Michaela's doctor said

24:53.075 --> 24:54.285
after 24 hours of bed rest,

24:54.327 --> 24:56.203
she's able to perform, so I, uh,

24:56.245 --> 24:59.081
booked her a little spot
on the stage in a few minutes,

24:59.123 --> 25:00.791
and I think the crowd's
really gonna love her.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.584
(sighs)
Um, Silver, look,

25:02.626 --> 25:04.920
I-I appreciate you feeling bad,
I really do.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.630
I even appreciate you
setting that up,

25:06.672 --> 25:07.714
but do you really
think Michaela

25:07.756 --> 25:09.091
performing for a beach festival
is gonna

25:09.133 --> 25:11.093
make up for the music video
I had planned?

25:11.135 --> 25:13.053
I don't really know
what's gonna make it up to you,

25:13.095 --> 25:15.264
but, uh, I'll tell you what,
as a friend,

25:15.306 --> 25:18.892
it would really mean a lot
if you stuck around.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.811
(sighs)

25:23.856 --> 25:26.275
♪ ♪

25:30.737 --> 25:32.490
Hey.
Hey.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.450
Have you seen Dixon?
I really need to talk to him.

25:34.492 --> 25:35.826
Yeah, he's over
by the showers.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.370
Please don't talk
too long, okay?

25:37.411 --> 25:38.620
Michaela's playing soon.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.374
Oh, don't worry, I just need
to undo Naomi's damage.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.000
Should only take Dixon
about five minutes

25:43.042 --> 25:44.835
to scare Mark away
from Adrianna for good.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.299
Brock,

25:50.341 --> 25:52.009
so glad you could make it.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.302
Hey, thanks for the invite.

25:53.344 --> 25:54.887
Yeah.
Yeah,
I thought we'd head outside,

25:54.928 --> 25:56.180
but I-I can't tear my daughter

25:56.222 --> 25:57.223
away from those surfboards.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.556
That's what I was hoping for

25:58.598 --> 26:00.017
when I put together the display.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.768
You did?
Yeah, yeah, I'm handling

26:01.810 --> 26:04.271
the marketing campaign for my
friend's new surfboard company.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.399
Pretty much handling
everything you talked about,

26:06.440 --> 26:08.442
branding, launching,
financial backing.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.485
Pretty impressive.

26:09.527 --> 26:11.904
Yeah, well, uh,
not as impressive

26:11.945 --> 26:12.863
as this gentleman right here,

26:12.905 --> 26:14.365
Liam Court, CEO,
board shaper,

26:14.407 --> 26:15.991
and star of
Corporate Invaders.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.451
Liam, meet,
uh, Brock Page.

26:17.493 --> 26:18.744
Nice to meet you.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.287
I must say, it's impressive

26:20.329 --> 26:22.748
that you two managed
to land start-up financing.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.582
I'd love to meet your investor.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.626
Yeah, sure.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.046
Uh, listen,
if you will excuse me,

26:29.088 --> 26:31.840
I just want a minute
with my head of marketing.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.759
Yeah, sure.
One second.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.219
Uh, please tell me

26:35.261 --> 26:36.594
you straightened
everything out with Sydney.

26:36.636 --> 26:37.971
She's married.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.015
What?
Yeah.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.725
Okay, uh, I did not
see that coming.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.061
No, um, but that's
good news because, uh,

26:44.103 --> 26:45.438
now she can be our investor.

26:45.479 --> 26:46.939
Right?

26:46.980 --> 26:49.442
I don't think so, man.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.151
(quietly):
I don't think so?

26:51.193 --> 26:53.279
What does that mean?

26:53.320 --> 26:54.863
Everything okay,
Shirazi?

26:54.905 --> 26:57.157
Yeah, fine,
fine, fine, fine.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.785
Uh, why don't we see if your
daughter wants to hit the beach

26:59.826 --> 27:01.619
and, uh, test-drive
one of our boards?

27:01.661 --> 27:02.662
Yeah, that'd be great.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.622
Hey, Frankie.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.624
Right this way.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.586
Hey, Mark. It looks
so great in here.

27:08.626 --> 27:12.131
Anyway, I was just telling Dixon
about the chef job in New York.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.883
Yeah, man, that sounds like
it's gonna be pretty good.

27:14.925 --> 27:16.885
If it pans out,
I'll owe it all to Annie.

27:16.927 --> 27:19.305
Well, I like to help my
brothers out where I can.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.014
Of course, sometimes
you have to let them

27:21.056 --> 27:22.558
make their own mistakes.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.809
DIXON:
Like what?

27:23.850 --> 27:25.936
Like getting a bad haircut

27:25.978 --> 27:29.189
or I don't know,
dating Adrianna.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.316
What's wrong
with Dixon's hair?

27:30.357 --> 27:31.525
I don't know.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.692
I think I look dope.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.903
You see, Adrianna
cheated on Dixon,

27:34.945 --> 27:36.905
practically while he
was dying. You can ask

27:36.947 --> 27:39.116
him yourself; I mean, who
does something like that?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.742
The kind of person who would
do anything to get her way.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.578
Um, I don't think
Adrianna's like that.

27:42.620 --> 27:43.621
I'm talking about Annie.

27:43.661 --> 27:44.622
Do not listen to a word

27:44.662 --> 27:45.705
that she has to say,
you understand?

27:45.747 --> 27:46.706
No, not really.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.000
Silver told me that you

27:48.041 --> 27:50.710
dragged Dixon here
to fill Mark's head full of crap

27:50.752 --> 27:52.254
about Adrianna.
I only want him to
know the facts.

27:52.296 --> 27:55.090
The fact is that Adrianna
is a great person.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.925
I'm sure you were focusing on
the fact that she was a cheater

27:56.967 --> 27:58.676
and a liar and a drug addict,
but shame on you, Dixon,

27:58.718 --> 28:01.013
for getting involved
in any of this.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.848
I-I really wasn't.
MARK:
Yeah, he wasn't.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.016
Unbelievable!

28:04.057 --> 28:06.684
Yes, I think Mark dating Ade is
a terrible idea,

28:06.726 --> 28:09.104
but you're the one
who's pimping her out.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.564
Okay, maybe Ade is a tramp,

28:10.606 --> 28:13.150
but even she's a better option
than Mark moving to New York.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.527
Oh, my God.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.612
Oh, no.

28:21.741 --> 28:22.993
Ade, wait.

28:24.495 --> 28:25.703
DIXON:
Uh...

28:38.258 --> 28:39.968
BROCK:
I like the surfboards.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.094
Yeah?

28:41.136 --> 28:43.055
And I have to admit, the
girl angle is clever,

28:43.096 --> 28:45.224
but it takes more than
that to launch a product.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.725
Absolutely,
that's why I'm so excited

28:46.766 --> 28:48.268
about our image campaign.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.520
By aiming our product

28:49.562 --> 28:52.147
primarily at girls like
your daughter,

28:52.189 --> 28:54.567
the face we put out
there will be crucial.

28:54.608 --> 28:55.984
Speak of the devil.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.653
This is our beautiful
and talented, uh,

28:57.695 --> 29:00.698
celebrity spokeswoman,
Adrianna Tate-Duncan.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.532
Hey.

29:01.574 --> 29:04.159
Uh, are you-you okay?

29:04.201 --> 29:05.661
No, I'm not okay.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.913
Apparently, I'm a whore!

29:10.624 --> 29:12.459
I'll be right back.
NAVID:
Uh...

29:12.501 --> 29:14.503
(chuckles nervously)

29:16.004 --> 29:18.632
So, how do you like your board?

29:18.674 --> 29:21.510
I can't believe Ade walked in
on us talking like that.

29:21.552 --> 29:23.512
She must think we're
the worst friends ever.

29:23.554 --> 29:25.222
(groans) Is she wrong?

29:25.264 --> 29:26.973
You said it,
"What Naomi wants, Naomi gets."

29:27.015 --> 29:28.267
I never learn.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.393
What about me?

29:29.435 --> 29:31.144
What you said about
how I treat Dixon.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.397
You're right, I
do smother him.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.108
I try and say it's because I
want what's best for him,

29:36.149 --> 29:38.193
but maybe I'm just
really controlling.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.862
Why is it so hard for
me to just back off?

29:40.904 --> 29:42.698
If I could've backed off
and stop meddling,

29:42.740 --> 29:44.199
maybe I'd still
be married to Max.

29:44.241 --> 29:46.535
At least we can agree
that we both suck.

29:46.577 --> 29:49.037
You know, at first I
was just trying to help,

29:49.079 --> 29:51.415
but then I really
wanted to win.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.209
I know. I want Mark to stay,
but at a certain point,

29:54.251 --> 29:56.086
I wanted to beat you
more than anything.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.879
What's with that? Why do we
always do that to each other?

29:57.921 --> 29:59.256
I don't know; it's pathetic.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.425
The only other person I fight
with like this is Dixon.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.302
And me with Jen.

30:04.386 --> 30:05.596
(sighs)

30:05.638 --> 30:09.015
Maybe the reason
why we fight like we do

30:09.057 --> 30:12.311
and we can say anything
to each other,

30:12.352 --> 30:13.812
which we normally do,

30:13.853 --> 30:15.105
is (sighs)

30:15.147 --> 30:17.566
because we're like sisters.

30:17.608 --> 30:19.693
(chuckles)

30:20.653 --> 30:22.154
Yeah, we are.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.447
It makes sense anyway.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.740
We share a brother.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.326
And I'd hate to lose Mark

30:27.367 --> 30:29.703
to New York, but honestly,

30:29.745 --> 30:33.332
I'd feel a ton worse
if I lost you

30:33.373 --> 30:34.667
or if lost Ade.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.461
Come on, we have to find her.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.421
Yeah.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.676
Hey,

30:43.717 --> 30:45.302
Adrianna's practically in tears.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.553
What happened?

30:46.595 --> 30:48.013
Annie and Naomi happened.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.348
Don't ask me how or why.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.266
This whole sister thing
is new to me.

30:51.308 --> 30:52.976
I never imagined it would be
so complicated.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.145
Look,

30:55.187 --> 30:56.896
they've both been
through a lot lately.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.148
And right now,
like it or not,

30:58.190 --> 31:00.066
you're about the only family
they have.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.695
Insta-family dysfunction.
Lucky me.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.279
Yeah, well, you got to know

31:04.321 --> 31:06.906
that Naomi would be crushed
if you leave.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.241
Although, I guess
Annie's right.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.369
You'd be crazy to pass
on that job offer, huh?

31:10.410 --> 31:12.078
Crazy or just freaked out.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.499
Look, I know I said I was
interested in the New York job

31:15.541 --> 31:17.459
because most restaurants fail,
but the truth is

31:17.501 --> 31:19.461
I've never had to depend
on anyone.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.421
With my truck, I could always
just drive away.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.173
Ah, the instinct to run.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.508
I know about that.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.843
And what if I fail?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.969
I've never had to worry
about letting someone down.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.431
New York's like driving away,
making a clean break.

31:31.473 --> 31:34.184
Well, you can't run away,
'cause they will track you down.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.062
But I mean,
isn't it better to know

31:37.103 --> 31:38.480
someone cares about you
instead of being alone?

31:38.522 --> 31:40.190
I don't know.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.859
Maybe.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.569
For any relationship
to be worth something,

31:43.610 --> 31:45.362
it's got to be
a little complicated, right?

31:45.404 --> 31:46.613
At least,
that's what it said

31:46.655 --> 31:48.073
in a fortune cookie I got once.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.992
NAVID:
Well, Brock left,

31:51.034 --> 31:52.703
and I think my job left
with him.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.413
Whew, I'm sorry, man.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.873
Speaking of leaving,

31:55.914 --> 31:57.416
are you taking
that New York gig?

31:57.457 --> 31:58.584
Because I'm totally available

31:58.625 --> 32:00.085
if the Offshore
needs a new manager.

32:00.126 --> 32:01.253
Just saying.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.129
You know, I haven't really
made up my mind yet.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.548
SILVER:
Hey, everybody,

32:04.590 --> 32:06.717
thanks for being here.
Hey, come on, let's
get out there.

32:08.176 --> 32:09.344
Put your hands together

32:09.386 --> 32:12.431
for Unfaithful Records'
new recording artist,

32:12.472 --> 32:14.391
Michaela!

32:14.433 --> 32:17.853
(applause)

32:17.895 --> 32:20.480
This song is for that
one special person

32:20.522 --> 32:22.608
who really believes in my music.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.610
Dixon, this one's for you.

32:24.651 --> 32:25.985
(applause)

32:33.744 --> 32:34.953
It's too bad.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.163
I really think our music video
would have rocked.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.498
If I hadn't screwed it up?

32:38.540 --> 32:39.958
Hey.

32:39.999 --> 32:42.210
I know it's not easy being
my friend these days,

32:42.252 --> 32:44.087
especially with
everything going on.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.422
I've made everything about me,

32:45.464 --> 32:47.758
but the music video was
for all three of us.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.384
It was our dream.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.470
And I think we could
still make it come true.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.638
Yeah?

32:52.679 --> 32:53.806
Yeah.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.307
I mean,
I want to believe you,

32:55.348 --> 32:57.643
especially watching these people
listening to her music.

32:59.937 --> 33:02.314
Look at them dance.

Really?

Because when you were saying

33:57.076 --> 33:58.370

35:28.794 --> 35:33.048

35:33.090 --> 35:37.010

(music stops, people cheering)

35:38.637 --> 35:40.597
(cheering, whistling)

35:48.772 --> 35:50.607
Just promise me
when you get your

35:50.649 --> 35:52.692
job and you become the hottest
chef in New York,

35:52.734 --> 35:54.193
that you'll get
a place big enough

35:54.235 --> 35:55.779
for me to stay
in when I visit.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.907
I'm not going to New York.

36:00.033 --> 36:00.993
What?

36:01.034 --> 36:01.994
I thought about it,

36:02.035 --> 36:03.328
but the thing is...

36:03.369 --> 36:04.454
I already have a job.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.999
This little
restaurant

36:07.040 --> 36:08.125
might not
be fancy.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.585
It might crash and burn
and bankrupt us both,

36:10.627 --> 36:11.670
driving me to insanity,

36:11.711 --> 36:14.631
but... it's ours.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.802
To brothers...

36:18.844 --> 36:19.803
and sisters.

36:19.845 --> 36:20.887
(laughs)

36:20.929 --> 36:22.180
To brothers and sisters.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.016
(laughs)

36:24.057 --> 36:24.933
Mm.

36:24.975 --> 36:26.309
Leave it to
Annie and Naomi

36:26.351 --> 36:27.853
to find new ways to
fight over a guy.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.188
I can't believe I got
caught in the middle.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.397
What a
nightmare.
Yeah.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.524
No kidding.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.317
To be honest,
after what they said,

36:34.359 --> 36:35.902
I can't believe you're
already okay with it.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.320
Yeah, it
was hard.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.823
But Naomi's letting me have a
Pomeranian puppy in the house,

36:39.865 --> 36:41.783
and Annie's taking
me to Maui, so...

36:41.825 --> 36:42.868
Good.
(laughs)

36:42.909 --> 36:44.036
The thing is,

36:44.077 --> 36:46.121
the whole time
that Naomi was pushing me

36:46.163 --> 36:48.040
to flirt with Mark...

36:48.081 --> 36:49.374
I thought he liked you.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.126
Really?

36:51.168 --> 36:52.293
Why? What made
you think that?

36:52.335 --> 36:54.629
The other night at dinner,
you guys...

36:54.671 --> 36:55.922
like the same things,

36:55.964 --> 36:57.256
like the Guggenheim, and stuff.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.758
(laughs)

36:58.800 --> 37:00.719
Not to mention, he is...

37:00.760 --> 37:01.845
really cute.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.141
Yeah, now that you mention it...

37:06.183 --> 37:07.934
he ain't bad.
(giggles)

37:07.976 --> 37:09.644
In like a hot, manly,

37:09.686 --> 37:12.564
"I-can-cook" kind of way.

37:12.605 --> 37:13.732
I could totally go there.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.526
Silver, we can't wind up
in a fight to the death

37:16.568 --> 37:17.944
over Naomi and Annie's brother.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.029
Are you kidding?

37:19.071 --> 37:20.739
Look, after what almost went
down with Dixon,

37:20.780 --> 37:22.115
I am not about to lose
another friend.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.867
Okay. Well, then,
let's make a pact.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.618
All right?
Mark is off limits.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.619
Okay.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.038
Mark is off limits. Deal.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.708
(giggling)

37:35.921 --> 37:37.380
(doorbell rings)

37:41.509 --> 37:42.719
Liam...

37:42.761 --> 37:44.303
I'm glad you called.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.556
Whoa.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.101
So, uh... I
was thinking

37:49.142 --> 37:51.019
about what you
said earlier today.

37:51.061 --> 37:53.021
And I think I
changed my mind.

37:53.063 --> 37:56.191
About me investing
in your surf company,

37:56.233 --> 37:57.776
or about us?

37:57.817 --> 37:59.236
Both.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.570
Yeah?

38:00.612 --> 38:01.863
It sort of came to me

38:01.905 --> 38:04.532
when I heard about a friend's
fortune cookie.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.534
I think I'm good
with complicated.

38:19.214 --> 38:22.425
NAVID:
Hi, uh, Navid Shirazi
for Brock Page.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.220
Uh, yes, I'm fully aware of how
many times I've been calling.

38:25.262 --> 38:27.639
Um, can you please just...

38:27.680 --> 38:28.723
He will?

38:28.765 --> 38:30.850
Uh, that'd be great.
Thank you.

38:30.892 --> 38:31.935
Shirazi.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.394
Just watched your video
on YouTube.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.813
Dancing girls
with your surfboards?

38:34.854 --> 38:35.814
Pure genius.

38:35.855 --> 38:37.690
I absolutely loved it.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.192
No... uh, yeah, that's, uh...

38:39.234 --> 38:40.568
that's-that's what
I was going for.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.779
A marketing device that would
just reach out

38:42.821 --> 38:43.738
and grab our customers.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.115
Well, it's great branding

38:45.157 --> 38:46.741
and shows real marketing
expertise.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.910
So, assuming your grades are
what you say they are,

38:48.952 --> 38:50.453
you're my pick
for our trainee program.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.205
What do you say?
That'd be great.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.706
Thank you.

38:53.748 --> 38:54.791
(grunts) Yes!

38:54.833 --> 38:56.626
(whoops)

38:56.668 --> 38:58.044
What happened?

38:58.086 --> 38:59.337
That job manning the
drive-through window

38:59.378 --> 39:01.589
at "Loser Burger" finally
came through, huh?

39:01.631 --> 39:02.924
Huh. Very funny.

39:02.966 --> 39:05.051
No, um, that was me getting the
job that you said

39:05.093 --> 39:06.970
I would never get. Huh.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.888
Guess I don't need your
Cronus Society after all.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.850
Later, dumb-ass.

39:11.891 --> 39:14.560

I can't believe how cool

39:24.863 --> 39:26.948
(laughs): I know.
(phone rings)

39:26.990 --> 39:29.034
Honestly, I think
it turned out better

39:29.075 --> 39:30.285
then the video
we had planned.

39:30.327 --> 39:31.870
Uh...

39:31.911 --> 39:34.039
Hey, thank you.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.165
Seriously.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.503
Hey, Michaela,
come check it out.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.255
You're, like, totally viral.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.049
I think you have
about 400,000 new fans.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.884
(laughs)

39:46.968 --> 39:49.846
Better make it 400,001.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.475
It's official.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.895
I'm pregnant.
(gasps)

39:56.936 --> 39:58.813
I'm pregnant,
I'm pregnant!

39:58.855 --> 40:00.398
(both laughing)
Oh!

40:00.439 --> 40:01.649
They called? They said...?

40:01.691 --> 40:03.068
(laughing):
Yeah...

40:03.109 --> 40:05.028
(laughing, Silver shrieks)

40:05.070 --> 40:07.446
Oh, be careful with her.
Back up.

40:07.488 --> 40:08.740
Oh, my God.

40:08.781 --> 40:09.866
(shrieks)

40:16.915 --> 40:19.709
I need to ask you
a little favor.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.921
You need me to go.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.339
Yeah.

40:24.381 --> 40:26.841
It's just that my stepson's
gonna be home soon, and

40:26.883 --> 40:28.301
it would
be...
I got it.

40:28.343 --> 40:29.928
Um...

40:29.969 --> 40:32.013
and if you don't mind,

40:32.055 --> 40:34.140
can you use
the back door, please?

40:34.182 --> 40:37.269
(chuckles)

40:37.310 --> 40:39.396
Yeah.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.035
(door closes)

40:54.077 --> 40:55.453
CAMPBELL:
I know.

40:55.494 --> 40:56.495
Yeah, I know.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.872
They're withholding
the semester grades

40:57.914 --> 40:59.082
because they know
we were cheating.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.499
It's gonna come out.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.294
We've got nothing
to worry about.

41:02.335 --> 41:03.544
I've taken care of everything.

41:03.586 --> 41:07.132
Everyone at Cronus
is going to be okay.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.675
Because I've set
Navid Shirazi up

41:09.717 --> 41:11.803
to take the fall
for the whole thing.

41:11.844 --> 41:12.971
Okay?

41:13.012 --> 41:14.680
All right. See you.
