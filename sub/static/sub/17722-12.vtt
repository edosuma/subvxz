00:03.000 --> 00:04.750
You don't think
it's a good idea?

00:04.750 --> 00:06.000
I think you're being
impulsive.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.375
You know what? I'm sorry
I even brought it up.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.041
Come on, Erica,

00:09.041 --> 00:10.708
you just lost your first
job in publishing

00:10.708 --> 00:12.416
and now you wanna run
your own business?

00:12.416 --> 00:14.291
A lot of people start
their own companies.

00:14.291 --> 00:17.500
A lot of people
also fail at it.

00:20.125 --> 00:23.666
You don't think
that I can do this.

00:23.666 --> 00:25.333
(huffs in disbelief)

00:25.333 --> 00:26.541
Wow, that's great.

00:26.541 --> 00:27.875
Look, I'm just
being honest.

00:27.875 --> 00:29.791
You don't know anything
about running a business.

00:29.791 --> 00:31.291
Well, then I'll
figure it out.

00:31.291 --> 00:33.291
And what if you can't?
What happens then?

00:33.291 --> 00:34.791
Look, try and be
realistic here.

00:34.791 --> 00:37.041
Do you honestly believe
you're ready - 100 percent?

00:37.041 --> 00:38.041
Yes.

00:39.666 --> 00:41.583
I...

00:41.583 --> 00:42.625
I don't know.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.750
You're getting ahead
of yourself.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.750
You're jumping in
totally blind.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.666
It's too risky.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.875
(inhales and exhales deeply)

00:55.875 --> 00:57.750
Maybe you're right.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.875
Slow and steady
wins the race, okay?

01:00.875 --> 01:01.875
Yeah.

Erica: have you ever woken
up and had that feeling

01:53.541 --> 01:56.000
like something
just isn't right?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.916
Like you've slept all night,
but still aren't rested?

01:58.916 --> 02:00.416
Like there's a weight,

02:00.416 --> 02:02.666
a heaviness in your heart
that you can't quite name?

02:02.666 --> 02:03.666
Ethan?

02:05.791 --> 02:08.041
Hey. What're
you doing up?

02:08.041 --> 02:09.958
Habit, I guess.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.458
Mm.

02:13.458 --> 02:15.166
How're you feeling?

02:15.166 --> 02:15.750
Good.

02:15.750 --> 02:16.458
You sure?

02:16.458 --> 02:17.708
Yeah.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.875
I mean, everything that
you said last night,

02:19.875 --> 02:21.333
it... It makes sense.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.250
I'm just processing it.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.000
Okay. I love you.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.666
I love you too.

02:27.791 --> 02:29.000
See you tonight?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.500
Definitely.

02:31.541 --> 02:34.041
Erica: Have you ever woken
up in your own bed

02:34.041 --> 02:36.041
and just felt... Lost?

02:36.041 --> 02:38.208
(phone rings,
erica murmurs)

02:41.583 --> 02:43.541
(beeps phone on)

02:43.541 --> 02:44.250
Hello?

02:44.250 --> 02:45.791
Rise and shine, chicken.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.041
Julianne, it's
not even 8:00.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.458
She can tell
time, good,

02:48.458 --> 02:50.125
because our level two
ashtanga class

02:50.125 --> 02:52.166
starts in less
than an hour.

02:52.166 --> 02:53.416
No.

02:53.416 --> 02:54.500
Julianne: it's a slippery
slope, Strange.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.708
One morning you sit down
to watch Oprah.

02:56.708 --> 02:58.791
Two years later,
you're agoraphobic,

02:58.791 --> 02:59.958
morbidly obese,

02:59.958 --> 03:01.666
and sharing your apartment
with 53 cats.

03:01.666 --> 03:02.708
Cautionary tale.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.166
You are not gonna let
me sleep in.

03:04.166 --> 03:05.500
Julianne:
no way, jose!

03:05.500 --> 03:07.416
Plus, this is yoga and our
first business meeting,

03:07.416 --> 03:08.500
so chop-chop!

03:08.875 --> 03:10.375
(phones beep off)

03:12.750 --> 03:14.666
Jody: I gotta say, your
demo...

03:14.666 --> 03:16.083
it's righteous, guys.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.333
A bit raw, of course,
but it's good.

03:18.333 --> 03:19.416
So you, uh...

03:19.416 --> 03:20.916
Got the song I sent,
right?

03:20.916 --> 03:23.166
We did. The boys have it,
we're on it.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.416
Cool. Good to hear.

03:25.416 --> 03:26.833
Any thoughts, Kai?

03:27.833 --> 03:30.250
Yeah, song's okay.
I guess.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.125
It's commercial.

03:32.125 --> 03:33.750
It's not a bad
thing, you know.

03:33.750 --> 03:37.000
See, your sound's a bit
too... Garage band.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.125
Right. But we
sign with you,

03:39.125 --> 03:41.625
we sing your song, you'll
get us a record deal.

03:41.625 --> 03:42.666
Overnight.

03:42.666 --> 03:44.375
And if we do, who
steers our ship?

03:44.875 --> 03:46.125
You or us?

03:48.958 --> 03:50.875
I'll tell you what.

03:51.916 --> 03:54.083
I'll bring some guys
from universal to uh...

03:54.083 --> 03:55.708
This open mic night.

03:55.708 --> 03:57.875
Just play the song
and you'll be golden.

03:57.875 --> 03:58.875
Okay?

04:02.375 --> 04:05.458
But you blow it?

04:05.458 --> 04:07.583
We'll be gone
before the chorus.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.208
Got it?

04:09.208 --> 04:11.541
See ya tonight, boys.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.458
"Who steers our ship?"

04:18.458 --> 04:20.750
Are you insane? He wants
to sign the band.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.833
I know, but we have
to protect ourselves.

04:22.833 --> 04:25.666
I'm serious, man, if you
screw this up for us,

04:25.666 --> 04:26.958
then this whole thing -

04:26.958 --> 04:29.625
the band, our friendship?

04:29.625 --> 04:30.625
It's over!

04:41.750 --> 04:42.750
Oh!

04:44.291 --> 04:45.375
Hello, stranger.

04:45.375 --> 04:46.375
Hey.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.833
So... I loved it.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.791
The manuscript?

04:53.791 --> 04:54.791
That's great.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.875
Erica.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.708
I liked the book.

04:59.708 --> 05:00.833
You should be happy.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.750
I am. It's just...

05:02.750 --> 05:05.958
Julianne, I don't think
I can do this.

05:05.958 --> 05:07.541
I can't start a business.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.541
What? Why?

05:10.666 --> 05:11.833
Instructor: Hi, everyone.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.416
Welcome to class.

05:13.416 --> 05:15.333
My name's Jess.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.916
Just take it at your
own pace today.

05:17.916 --> 05:21.208
And remember to listen
to your body.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.458
Let's begin,

05:22.458 --> 05:25.291
standing with feet
hip-width apart.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.791
Arms at your sides.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.833
...From here, come to
stand on the knees,

05:31.833 --> 05:33.500
to prepare for camel.

05:34.583 --> 05:37.708
Now we're gonna open
our hearts.

05:37.708 --> 05:40.583
Inhale, lift up through
the chest.

05:41.583 --> 05:43.000
Then, as you exhale,

05:43.000 --> 05:46.541
trace your eyes along
the ceiling to the back wall

05:46.541 --> 05:48.625
and reach for your heels.

05:49.708 --> 05:53.583
See if you can lift up
through the chest.

05:54.583 --> 05:55.666
Open...

05:56.833 --> 05:57.833
Open...

05:59.833 --> 06:01.208
And breathe.

06:04.666 --> 06:06.416
You're doing great.
Again.

06:06.416 --> 06:08.916
(emotional breaths,
welling up)

06:13.166 --> 06:14.916
No, no, it's okay.
It happens.

06:14.916 --> 06:15.916
(sobbing)

06:17.166 --> 06:19.375
you're just releasing
what you were feeling.

06:19.375 --> 06:20.458
(Erica sobs)

06:21.958 --> 06:23.708
Excuse me...
(crying)

06:25.333 --> 06:26.333
I'm sorry.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.416
Julianne: Erica!

06:31.416 --> 06:33.083
Erica, hold up.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.958
What is it?
What's wrong?

06:36.958 --> 06:39.250
I don't- I don't know.
I'm just, I...

06:39.250 --> 06:40.791
I'm acting insane.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.375
Is this about our plan?

06:42.375 --> 06:44.000
The manuscript?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.291
You said you couldn't
do it. Why not?

06:46.291 --> 06:49.166
Look, I talked
with Ethan

06:49.166 --> 06:51.958
and... It's too risky.

06:51.958 --> 06:54.041
I'm a junior editor,
and I'm barely that.

06:54.041 --> 06:56.083
Stop.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.291
Listen,

06:57.291 --> 07:00.416
I admit it, yesterday
I was a "Debbie downer."

07:00.416 --> 07:02.458
But then I thought about
what you said

07:02.458 --> 07:04.208
and I realized
you were right.

07:04.208 --> 07:07.416
We have this amazing
opportunity here

07:07.416 --> 07:09.375
to do something bigger.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.958
And we're smart,

07:10.958 --> 07:13.666
and we have
had successes

07:13.666 --> 07:16.083
and we both want this.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.291
Don't you want this?

07:18.875 --> 07:22.291
Well, no risk, no
reward, sister.

07:23.666 --> 07:27.333
Oh God. I'm just so
confused right now.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.000
Just, just...

07:32.000 --> 07:33.916
Think about it,
okay?

07:34.916 --> 07:36.916
(exhaling)

07:41.958 --> 07:44.750
You look like a man
on a mission.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.083
I'm done fighting.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.833
Everybody wants me to
finish the stupid regret -

07:47.833 --> 07:48.666
you, Erica.

07:48.666 --> 07:50.083
Now I've had it,
so screw it.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.583
I'm sick of arguing
about it.

07:51.583 --> 07:53.625
What're you gonna do?

07:53.625 --> 07:55.875
I'm gonna finish the damn
song and go back.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.041
The question is:

07:57.041 --> 07:58.916
are you happy?

07:59.666 --> 08:01.458
Do I look happy?

08:01.458 --> 08:03.458
My apartment runs outta
hot water every morning.

08:03.458 --> 08:04.958
I can barely
afford to eat.

08:04.958 --> 08:07.041
My friends all talk
and act like teenagers.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.583
Me and Travis?

08:08.583 --> 08:10.375
I resent him

08:10.375 --> 08:11.875
and he hates me.

08:11.875 --> 08:13.000
I feel like...

08:13.000 --> 08:17.250
Like you've made things
worse, not better.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.666
I'm worn down.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.666
And I get it,
I can't...

08:21.666 --> 08:23.416
I can't save him,
I know -

08:23.416 --> 08:25.750
doesn't matter what I do.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.666
This therapy's not about
changing the past Kai.

08:28.666 --> 08:29.625
It never was.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.666
So what is the
point of it?

08:31.666 --> 08:34.583
That's for you
to figure out.

08:41.416 --> 08:44.333
(wind gusts gently,
traffic hums along)

09:03.333 --> 09:05.875
I am lost, Dr. Tom.

09:06.875 --> 09:10.041
Really, you're three
blocks from your house.

09:10.041 --> 09:12.958
Oh, that kind of lost.

09:12.958 --> 09:15.500
I mean, Ethan's reasons
for not opening a business,

09:15.500 --> 09:17.916
it totally make sense.

09:17.916 --> 09:20.500
But what Julianne
had to say...

09:20.500 --> 09:22.541
I mean, it does too.

09:22.541 --> 09:25.416
So whose advice
do I follow?

09:25.416 --> 09:26.791
(sighs heavily)

09:27.791 --> 09:28.791
Hmm.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.916
Come with me,
I wanna show you something.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.833
(chalk rasps against wall)

10:07.333 --> 10:09.958
"Every wall is a door."

10:09.958 --> 10:11.166
Emerson.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.166
Go ahead.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.166
Push.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.041
(exhales)

10:23.541 --> 10:24.958
(stunned gasp)

10:39.541 --> 10:40.916
(door grates open)

11:03.833 --> 11:05.708
Where are we going?

11:05.708 --> 11:07.208
Where indeed.

11:16.250 --> 11:19.250
(stunned,
speechless breaths)

11:21.750 --> 11:23.208
Choose a door.

11:24.208 --> 11:25.416
Just any door?

11:27.625 --> 11:29.916
Oh, help me out here,
I need some context.

11:29.916 --> 11:31.208
I mean, what am I...

11:31.208 --> 11:35.458
What am I supposed to do
and how do I choose?

11:35.458 --> 11:37.958
One day, alice came
to a fork in the road

11:37.958 --> 11:40.083
and saw a cheshire cat.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.083
"Which road do I take?"
she asked.

11:42.083 --> 11:45.208
"Where do you want to go?"
was his response.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.666
"I don't know,"
answered Alice.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.958
"Then," said the cat,
"it doesn't matter."

11:49.958 --> 11:51.708
I don't understand.

11:51.708 --> 11:52.750
It's not complicated.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.833
You can't stay
in this hallway forever.

11:54.833 --> 11:55.833
You have to choose.

11:55.833 --> 11:58.000
But how?!

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I mean, how am I
supposed to decide?

12:03.250 --> 12:05.125
Which one
feels right?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.958
Honestly, I don't know.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.375
So...

12:15.375 --> 12:17.083
(door closes)

12:17.083 --> 12:19.250
(inhales and exhales, tense)

12:22.250 --> 12:24.083
Uh...

12:30.375 --> 12:32.166
Wait!

12:32.166 --> 12:33.375
Dr. Tom, wait!

12:38.083 --> 12:39.125
You followed me.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.458
Well, where else
was I supposed to go?

12:41.458 --> 12:42.458
Okay.

12:43.166 --> 12:46.416
So, tell me about
"sillyfingers."

12:47.375 --> 12:48.875
Erica: Just, okay,
wait a second.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.333
You just threw me
down the rabbit hole

12:51.333 --> 12:53.208
and I have no idea why.

12:53.208 --> 12:55.125
Can we just please
back up here?

12:55.125 --> 12:57.541
Erica, you had three choices
back there.

12:57.541 --> 12:58.583
Choice one:

12:58.583 --> 13:00.375
Choose a door.

13:00.375 --> 13:01.333
Choice two:

13:01.333 --> 13:03.750
Stay in the hallway,
undecided.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.291
Or choice three:

13:05.291 --> 13:07.083
Follow me.

13:07.083 --> 13:10.041
Okay, so clearly I made
the wrong choice

13:10.041 --> 13:12.916
but that's just because
I don't understand

13:12.916 --> 13:14.458
what you're trying
to tell me.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.083
Ergo "sillyfingers."

13:17.083 --> 13:19.875
(sighs heavily)

13:19.875 --> 13:21.125
Okay, it was...

13:22.500 --> 13:25.750
It was 1999, I'd just started
my master's program.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.750
I was working part-time
as a T.A.

13:27.750 --> 13:31.458
For my thesis advisor,
professor Audrey Hogan.

13:31.458 --> 13:34.250
She was this
rhodes scholar,

13:34.250 --> 13:35.833
PhD from Oxford,

13:36.833 --> 13:39.041
and I'd fought
to get her.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.083
And then lived
to regret it.

13:42.083 --> 13:46.041
She was brilliant,
but she didn't suffer fools.

13:46.041 --> 13:48.250
I mean, everyone was
terrified of her,

13:48.250 --> 13:49.958
including me.

13:50.958 --> 13:54.791
And when she would do something
that would stress me out,

13:54.791 --> 13:56.791
I would email Cassidy -

13:56.791 --> 13:57.791
'cause her office,

13:57.791 --> 13:59.666
it was just down
the hall from mine.

13:59.666 --> 14:03.208
We would write
the most awful things.

14:03.208 --> 14:06.666
This one time, Hogan,
she got me really worked up,

14:06.666 --> 14:09.541
so I emailed Cassidy,
she wrote me back,

14:09.541 --> 14:12.666
and instead of hitting reply...

14:12.666 --> 14:15.875
I forwarded the message
to Hogan by mistake.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.125
And I didn't even know
that I did it

14:18.125 --> 14:19.875
until an hour later

14:19.875 --> 14:21.625
when she called me
into her office

14:21.625 --> 14:24.666
to inform me that
she was withdrawing

14:24.666 --> 14:26.625
as my thesis advisor.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.458
I was formally reprimanded,

14:28.458 --> 14:30.208
I was assigned
to a new professor

14:30.208 --> 14:32.291
who basically ignored me.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.750
(sighs, reflecting)

14:35.750 --> 14:37.583
I used to love academics.

14:38.583 --> 14:40.458
You know,
I thrived in that world,

14:40.458 --> 14:41.958
until my masters.

14:42.916 --> 14:43.958
And it's like Hogan

14:43.958 --> 14:46.833
and that whole
stupid incident,

14:46.833 --> 14:48.750
It, it tarnished it
for me.

14:51.375 --> 14:54.416
So, you're saying that
you mighta stayed on,

14:54.416 --> 14:56.250
gotten your PhD?

14:56.250 --> 14:57.166
Maybe.

14:57.166 --> 14:58.625
Dr. Tom:
Okay.

14:58.625 --> 15:01.416
And if you could
go back?

15:01.416 --> 15:05.250
Well, obviously,
I wouldn't have sent the email.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.250
(exhales)

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
(shaky breaths)

15:11.625 --> 15:12.625
Okay...

15:13.583 --> 15:14.666
Okay...

15:16.125 --> 15:18.666
(sighs, relieved,
books clunk)

15:18.666 --> 15:20.291
No...

15:20.291 --> 15:23.041
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

15:23.958 --> 15:24.958
Oh shit!

15:26.875 --> 15:28.916
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no no-no-no!

15:28.916 --> 15:30.500
No-no-no-no!

15:30.500 --> 15:33.750
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

15:33.750 --> 15:34.750
Cassidy:
Erica, what's wrong?

15:34.750 --> 15:35.375
No, there's no time.

15:35.375 --> 15:36.708
That email?

15:36.708 --> 15:37.541
I accidentally,
I hit "forward,"

15:37.541 --> 15:38.208
not "reply."

15:38.208 --> 15:39.958
Hogan, not Holland...

15:39.958 --> 15:42.708
Oh my god. You sent that,
all of that, to her?

15:42.708 --> 15:44.916
Yeah, come, come on!

15:47.083 --> 15:48.583
Excuse me, move it!

15:51.583 --> 15:53.000
(footsteps thud)

15:54.375 --> 15:55.625
Abort! Abort!

15:55.625 --> 15:57.458
Shit!

15:57.458 --> 15:59.458
Okay, don't worry,

15:59.458 --> 16:00.458
I got this.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.208
I need to speak
to Professor Hogan.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.958
Oh, I'm sorry,
but she's not in.

16:03.958 --> 16:05.500
Can I give her
a message?

16:05.500 --> 16:08.000
She gave me a "D" on my
Caleb Williams paper.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.500
And I can't
get a "D".

16:09.500 --> 16:11.500
Okay, well, I'm afraid
I can't help you.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.750
Cassidy: I'll just call her
at home myself, then.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.750
Receptionist:
Hey, uh, let me call you back.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.750
Uh, excuse me,
you can't look in there.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.500
Excuse me, what're you
gonna do, huh?

16:19.500 --> 16:20.791
Cassidy:
Call security?

16:20.791 --> 16:21.791
It doesn't matter
because Professor Hogan

16:21.791 --> 16:23.041
has already
ruined my life.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.541
See, my father
was a lawyer

16:24.541 --> 16:26.708
and my father's father
was lawyer,

16:26.708 --> 16:28.375
and his father...

16:28.375 --> 16:29.791
Oh, thank god!

16:29.791 --> 16:31.125
Cassidy: but he worked with
lawyers nonetheless,

16:31.125 --> 16:33.500
and I am the
last one!

16:33.500 --> 16:34.958
I wanna go to
arbitration,

16:34.958 --> 16:36.583
I want a second
opinion.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.000
Cassidy.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.166
Erica.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.750
Erica, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.583
This is so unfair,
she failed me!

16:42.583 --> 16:43.666
Oh, you know what?

16:43.666 --> 16:44.958
You're gonna be fine.

16:44.958 --> 16:46.125
Let's go.

16:46.125 --> 16:47.208
Receptionist:
Look, Professor Hogan,

16:47.208 --> 16:48.458
she'll be back
any minute.

16:48.458 --> 16:49.958
If your friend
wants to wait...

16:49.958 --> 16:52.125
No, no, I think
that it's better

16:52.125 --> 16:54.625
if she just cools down
for a bit, thank you.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.291
If she had gotten
that email,

16:56.291 --> 16:57.541
it would've been
so bad.

16:57.541 --> 16:58.541
You have no idea.

16:59.791 --> 17:00.916
Hogan: "The Importance
of Being Earnest"

17:00.916 --> 17:01.916
is a memorable title.

17:01.916 --> 17:03.208
But what does it
communicate?

17:03.208 --> 17:05.500
What is Wilde trying
to tell us?

17:05.500 --> 17:06.333
Yes?

17:06.333 --> 17:07.625
Student: I think he's
using the title

17:07.625 --> 17:09.416
to reinforce the
play's message,

17:09.416 --> 17:10.916
which is the importance
of honesty.

17:10.916 --> 17:12.416
Hogan: All right, but
let's not forget

17:12.416 --> 17:13.958
the recurring theme
of hypocrisy.

17:13.958 --> 17:15.208
Jack is living a lie,

17:15.208 --> 17:17.500
and yet all turns
out well in the end.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.750
Where's the morality
in that?

17:18.750 --> 17:19.750
Erica.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.541
What's your view?

17:22.541 --> 17:24.375
My view, um...

17:25.375 --> 17:28.750
I think that you both
make very good points.

17:28.750 --> 17:32.250
There's a kind of
unconventional honesty

17:32.250 --> 17:34.125
to the way that algernon
is living,

17:34.125 --> 17:38.375
whereas Jack,
he appears more conflicted.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.791
Hogan: Well, thank
you for that summary,

17:40.791 --> 17:42.791
but I asked for
a point of view.

17:42.791 --> 17:44.125
Your own.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.291
It appears you
don't have one.

17:49.291 --> 17:51.708
(computer keys clack,
knock at office door)

17:51.708 --> 17:53.125
Come in.

17:53.125 --> 17:54.458
Hello.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.166
Hogan:
Have a seat.

17:56.166 --> 17:59.500
We are meeting to discuss
your thesis proposal, yes?

17:59.500 --> 18:01.708
Yes, but I was hoping

18:01.708 --> 18:06.458
we could talk about what
happened in class today?

18:06.458 --> 18:07.833
Erica,
my time is valuable.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.333
If you wish
to spend it

18:09.333 --> 18:11.166
rehashing this
morning's events,

18:11.166 --> 18:12.750
well, that is
your choice.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.875
I think your time
would be better spent

18:14.875 --> 18:17.833
presenting your proposal.

18:17.833 --> 18:20.500
Okay, my proposed thesis
is titled,

18:20.500 --> 18:22.666
"The Woman In The Attic:

18:22.666 --> 18:25.875
Hidden Feminism In
Bronte's Jane Eyre."

18:26.916 --> 18:27.916
I see.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.333
That's it?

18:31.333 --> 18:32.583
Well, if you must choose

18:32.583 --> 18:33.875
the blandest possible
thesis topic,

18:33.875 --> 18:35.875
who am I to stand
in your way?

18:35.875 --> 18:37.416
Bland?!

18:37.416 --> 18:40.166
Professor Hogan, I have put
a lot of research into this.

18:40.166 --> 18:41.416
Oh, I'm sure you did.

18:41.416 --> 18:42.708
But as thesis topics go,

18:42.708 --> 18:45.166
you must know that
it is pedestrian,

18:45.166 --> 18:48.875
it's boring,
and it's been done.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.333
Regardless,
your thesis is approved.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.750
Thank you.

18:54.708 --> 18:56.500
Erica: I didn't even
send the email

18:56.500 --> 18:58.750
and, I swear, she hates me
more than before.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.291
Cassidy: Well,
she's crazy, clearly.

19:00.291 --> 19:01.625
I mean you're
so smart,

19:01.625 --> 19:04.083
so talented,
so adorable...

19:04.083 --> 19:05.083
Okay, easy.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.625
Just tell her
to shove it.

19:06.625 --> 19:07.916
Really?

19:07.916 --> 19:09.916
Yeah. Just 'cause
the woman has a PhD

19:09.916 --> 19:11.041
doesn't make her God.

19:11.041 --> 19:13.166
You need to confront her
and tell her off.

19:13.166 --> 19:14.500
Um, that's
the worst idea.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.041
Erica: I don't know. When
I stood up to Lozar,

19:17.041 --> 19:18.541
I mean, things got better.

19:18.541 --> 19:20.833
Yeah, but Lozar wasn't the head
of the english department.

19:20.833 --> 19:21.708
Oh my god.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.083
Is that what
they teach you

19:23.083 --> 19:24.125
in teacher's college,
huh?

19:24.125 --> 19:25.583
Hierarchies,
and blind submission?

19:25.583 --> 19:27.083
Why're you chewing
my head off?

19:27.083 --> 19:29.541
Because university
is about passion,

19:29.541 --> 19:31.583
it's about
original thought

19:31.583 --> 19:32.666
and taking a stand.

19:32.666 --> 19:34.833
Think about the '60s,
or Vietnam...

19:34.833 --> 19:36.583
Trust me, most
students in the '60s

19:36.583 --> 19:37.916
weren't sticking
flowers in guns,

19:37.916 --> 19:39.416
or taking acid trips
at woodstock.

19:39.416 --> 19:41.666
They were at university
to learn and to graduate

19:41.666 --> 19:42.666
and get real jobs.

19:42.666 --> 19:44.416
Cassidy: Okay, I
need to go now.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.416
Oh wait, hey,
Cassidy.

19:45.416 --> 19:46.916
No, really.

19:46.916 --> 19:49.125
If everyone was as complacent
as your friend Ethan here,

19:49.125 --> 19:51.958
you and I wouldn't even be
allowed to go to university.

19:52.208 --> 19:55.541
Ethan: Wow. Someone
needs to chill out.

19:55.541 --> 19:56.666
Seriously, Erica,

19:56.666 --> 19:58.416
you can't afford to alienate
your advisor.

19:58.416 --> 20:00.166
You need to win
Hogan over.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.125
Yeah, but how?

20:01.125 --> 20:02.666
I have no idea
what she wants.

20:02.666 --> 20:03.666
Ethan: Then ask her.

20:03.666 --> 20:04.833
Get her involved!

20:04.833 --> 20:05.916
People love being
asked for advice.

20:05.916 --> 20:08.416
That's what
I would do.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.791
(low hum of
student chatter)

20:14.208 --> 20:14.958
Erica: Professor Hogan?

20:14.958 --> 20:16.208
Can I talk to you?

20:16.208 --> 20:18.458
Hogan: Well, if you
can keep up with me.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.958
I was thinking about what
you said about my thesis.

20:20.958 --> 20:22.958
And, of course,
the last thing I want

20:22.958 --> 20:24.708
is to present a topic
that's underwhelming.

20:24.708 --> 20:26.458
Do you have another topic
in mind?

20:26.458 --> 20:28.791
Actually, I was wondering
if you had any ideas,

20:28.791 --> 20:30.625
or any suggestions.

20:34.125 --> 20:36.291
Are you asking me

20:36.291 --> 20:38.666
to come up with your
thesis proposal?

20:38.666 --> 20:40.125
No, no, I'm just...

20:40.125 --> 20:41.625
I'm just asking
for some guidance.

20:41.625 --> 20:44.125
No, you're asking me
to do the work for you.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.541
Remind me,

20:45.541 --> 20:48.833
why exactly are you in
this masters program?

20:48.833 --> 20:50.000
(awkward stammering)

20:50.000 --> 20:52.250
I'm just trying to give you
what you want.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.083
This has nothing
to do with me.

20:54.083 --> 20:58.375
It is your thesis,
your degree, your life.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.000
Figure it out,
Ms. Strange!

21:00.000 --> 21:01.791
And do it with another
thesis advisor.

21:01.791 --> 21:03.958
Frankly, I don't have
the time for this.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.333
Professor Hogan,
you can't just--

21:05.333 --> 21:07.500
Yes, I can.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.208
You find
someone else.

21:09.208 --> 21:12.500
I'm withdrawing
as your advisor.

21:26.458 --> 21:27.708
Erica, what're
you doing here?

21:27.708 --> 21:29.250
This is my level
200 class.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.750
I need to talk
to you.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.000
Well, I am not going
to change my mind.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.208
I know, but...

21:35.583 --> 21:40.125
I wanna understand what I did
to make you dislike me.

21:41.208 --> 21:43.833
You never answered
my question.

21:44.833 --> 21:47.625
Why are you in the
masters program?

21:47.625 --> 21:49.416
Because I need
my degree.

21:49.416 --> 21:51.750
You need your
degree.

21:53.041 --> 21:55.125
You know, Erica,
when I was your age,

21:55.125 --> 21:57.875
there wasn't one female
tenured professor

21:57.875 --> 21:59.041
in this faculty.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.458
But I didn't care,

22:00.458 --> 22:04.666
because I knew that this
was what I was meant to do.

22:04.666 --> 22:06.916
Do you have any idea
how frustrating it is

22:06.916 --> 22:09.291
to watch students waste years
hiding out in university

22:09.291 --> 22:11.041
when they could be
pursuing their dreams?

22:11.041 --> 22:13.041
And how do you know
I'm hiding out?

22:13.041 --> 22:15.708
Because you can't answer
the most basic question.

22:15.708 --> 22:17.625
Why are you here?

22:20.916 --> 22:22.166
You're a bright
girl, Erica.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.416
What do you want to do
with your life?

22:24.416 --> 22:26.166
(speechless stammers)

22:26.166 --> 22:27.666
I wanna be an editor.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.375
I wanna publish books.

22:30.208 --> 22:32.208
And I wanna start
my own company,

22:32.208 --> 22:33.666
as crazy as
that sounds.

22:34.666 --> 22:36.375
You know, Erica?

22:37.416 --> 22:39.416
30 years ago,

22:39.416 --> 22:41.875
when I told my father
that one day

22:41.875 --> 22:43.833
I wanted to chair
the english department,

22:43.833 --> 22:46.250
he laughed in my face.

22:49.666 --> 22:51.458
Leave the degrees
to the academics;

22:51.458 --> 22:54.250
you follow your
heart, Erica.

22:54.250 --> 22:57.583
Don't you let anyone
try to stop you.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.375
Thank you, professor.

23:07.250 --> 23:08.250
You're welcome.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.083
(purse jingles)

23:27.875 --> 23:30.083
(phone keys beep,
dialing)

23:37.625 --> 23:39.208
hey, Julianne, uh...

23:39.708 --> 23:42.000
What're you doing
right now?

23:42.000 --> 23:45.583
And so, if my crazy
mini nervous breakdown

23:45.583 --> 23:47.583
didn't put you off
the idea,

23:47.583 --> 23:51.291
I would still really
like to do this.

23:51.291 --> 23:53.583
Okay, this morning,
it was all too "risky"

23:53.583 --> 23:56.083
and then now it's...

23:56.083 --> 23:57.083
Peachy?

23:57.083 --> 23:59.625
I mean, Erica,
what's the dealio?

23:59.625 --> 24:01.500
Oh, I don't know.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.333
You know what?

24:02.333 --> 24:03.583
Actually, I do know.

24:03.583 --> 24:08.000
Ethan, he convinced me
that it was a bad idea.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.666
Oh, well,
maybe it is...

24:10.666 --> 24:12.166
For Ethan.

24:12.166 --> 24:14.041
But he's not you.

24:14.041 --> 24:15.375
What does that mean?

24:15.375 --> 24:17.583
Well, no offense,
but Ethan's not exactly...

24:17.583 --> 24:19.375
Jean Claude Van Damme.
you know?

24:19.375 --> 24:21.166
I mean, he plays
it pretty safe.

24:21.166 --> 24:23.666
You know,
he'll come around.

24:23.666 --> 24:24.666
Okay.

24:25.583 --> 24:27.666
Look, I just
wanna make sure,

24:27.666 --> 24:28.958
before I say yes,

24:28.958 --> 24:31.083
that you're not gonna
change your mind again,

24:31.083 --> 24:33.833
or let him change
it for you.

24:33.833 --> 24:35.833
I promise.

24:35.833 --> 24:36.916
(excited squeal)

24:36.916 --> 24:40.041
(laughing and
squealing excitedly)

24:40.041 --> 24:42.416
how "stoked" am I?!

24:42.416 --> 24:43.583
Partner.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.291
Erica and Julianne:
(squeal excitedly)

24:55.125 --> 24:56.625
(knock on the door)

25:05.541 --> 25:06.208
Kai?

25:06.208 --> 25:07.791
Hey.

25:07.791 --> 25:08.916
What're you doing here?

25:08.916 --> 25:10.791
I know you said
you needed your space.

25:10.791 --> 25:13.250
I'm not here
to get in the way...

25:13.250 --> 25:15.000
But I need to tell you
something.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.708
Yeah, no, of course.

25:16.708 --> 25:18.208
What's wrong?

25:18.208 --> 25:19.458
Well, I finished
my regret.

25:19.458 --> 25:20.958
I'm finished writing
"Alien Like You,"

25:20.958 --> 25:23.166
but I'm still here.

25:23.166 --> 25:25.375
Why am I still here?

25:29.291 --> 25:31.125
I don't understand.

25:31.791 --> 25:33.541
Is Dr. Fred just
messing with me?

25:33.541 --> 25:35.125
Is this some
kind of test?

25:35.125 --> 25:37.750
Everything is a test
with them.

25:37.750 --> 25:38.666
(water sloshes)

25:38.666 --> 25:40.166
Hey, listen,
can I ask you?

25:40.166 --> 25:42.083
What...

25:42.083 --> 25:45.208
What made you decide
to finally go through with it?

25:45.208 --> 25:47.125
When I first got here,

25:47.125 --> 25:49.458
things were great.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.833
Travis was alive.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.708
There was no money,
no drugs...

25:52.708 --> 25:54.958
So you decided
to stay.

25:54.958 --> 25:56.166
Yeah.

25:56.166 --> 25:58.458
And it was great
for a while.

25:58.458 --> 26:00.958
But I feel like I'm
messing it up with band,

26:00.958 --> 26:01.958
With travis.

26:01.958 --> 26:03.208
I keep trying
to change things,

26:03.208 --> 26:04.000
it's not working.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.375
Kai, the therapy,
it's...

26:06.375 --> 26:08.875
It's not really about
changing the past.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.125
That's what
Dr. Fred said.

26:10.125 --> 26:11.250
It's true.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.500
You learn that little
lesson pretty quick.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.500
Then what's
the point?

26:13.500 --> 26:15.250
What do they
want us to do?

26:15.250 --> 26:16.333
Oh come on, Kai,

26:16.333 --> 26:18.416
it's called "therapy"
for a reason.

26:18.416 --> 26:21.375
I mean changing your past,
it's easy.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.541
But changing yourself?

26:23.541 --> 26:24.791
It's much harder.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.125
You have to figure out
why you're really here.

26:27.125 --> 26:28.291
How?

26:28.291 --> 26:30.250
I honestly - I've got -
I have no idea.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.250
Um...

26:32.875 --> 26:33.875
Okay.

26:40.541 --> 26:41.708
Kai:
What're you doing?

26:41.708 --> 26:43.583
I am helping you.

26:43.583 --> 26:45.666
Please, have a seat.

26:45.666 --> 26:46.875
Dr. Erica?

26:46.875 --> 26:48.666
Just indulge me.

26:48.666 --> 26:51.416
Sit.

26:51.416 --> 26:52.416
(sighs)

26:57.750 --> 26:59.416
So, Kai Booker,

27:00.791 --> 27:03.000
let's go back
to the beginning.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.500
(german accent)
please explain to me

27:04.500 --> 27:07.833
why was "Alien Like You"
a regret?

27:07.833 --> 27:09.333
Okay, if we're
gonna do this,

27:09.333 --> 27:11.291
you gotta talk like
a normal person.

27:11.291 --> 27:15.166
Sorry, I just got a little
carried away there.

27:15.166 --> 27:16.250
Please.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.833
Well, that song
was just honest.

27:18.833 --> 27:21.083
It was how I felt
when I wrote it.

27:21.083 --> 27:22.833
I wasn't trying
to please anyone,

27:22.833 --> 27:24.250
or sell records.

27:25.250 --> 27:28.375
I was just...

27:28.375 --> 27:31.375
Being true to yourself.

27:31.375 --> 27:32.375
Yeah.

27:33.250 --> 27:36.750
Hmm. If I was Dr. Tom,
I would say...

27:38.916 --> 27:42.916
"This above all,
to thine own self be true."

27:42.916 --> 27:44.125
Shakespeare.

27:45.791 --> 27:47.541
It sounds better
when he does it,

27:47.541 --> 27:49.916
but you get what
I'm saying.

27:49.916 --> 27:54.416
How can you be true to yourself
in your current situation?

27:54.416 --> 27:55.583
What can you do?

28:01.708 --> 28:05.375
(hum of chatter and music
throughout goblins)

28:10.291 --> 28:11.666
So?

28:11.666 --> 28:14.041
So, I guess I should
find the guys, huh?

28:14.041 --> 28:15.375
Yeah.

28:15.375 --> 28:16.833
Can I ask you
something?

28:16.833 --> 28:18.875
If this all works
and I go back,

28:18.875 --> 28:21.166
what's it gonna be like
when I get there?

28:21.166 --> 28:23.875
(breathes deeply,
contemplating)

28:23.875 --> 28:25.250
The same...

28:25.250 --> 28:27.208
For the most part.

28:27.208 --> 28:30.166
And will I remember
everything?

28:30.166 --> 28:32.166
Will I remember you?

28:32.166 --> 28:33.958
Yes.

28:33.958 --> 28:34.958
Good.

28:37.708 --> 28:39.208
So, should I
look you up?

28:39.208 --> 28:41.291
Please, Kai, don't.

28:41.625 --> 28:43.625
And if you're going to,
don't tell me

28:43.625 --> 28:47.458
because it's just too weird
to think about.

28:48.083 --> 28:50.208
Plus, I'll be 40.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.875
More like 42...

28:54.041 --> 28:55.875
I'm gonna miss you.

28:56.666 --> 28:57.916
But you'll be fine,
right?

28:57.916 --> 29:00.458
I mean... You got Ethan.

29:01.875 --> 29:03.958
I bet you won't even
notice I'm gone.

29:03.958 --> 29:05.333
Yes, I will.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.958
Erica...

29:13.041 --> 29:14.041
Hey...

29:22.125 --> 29:24.875
Go. I'll come
and see you after.

29:24.875 --> 29:26.625
Okay.

29:26.625 --> 29:28.958
Okay.

29:32.083 --> 29:34.583
Dave: Now, folks, put
your hands together

29:34.583 --> 29:37.458
and give it up for my
favourite band -

29:37.458 --> 29:38.541
Head.

29:38.541 --> 29:40.625
(crowd cheers
and applauds)

29:44.208 --> 29:45.333
Hey, man.

29:45.333 --> 29:46.458
I'm sorry I've been
letting you down.

29:46.458 --> 29:47.708
No worries.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.000
You okay, man?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.166
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm great.

29:57.333 --> 29:59.000
(mic feedback buzzes)

30:00.250 --> 30:01.625
Hey, how's everybody
doin' tonight?

30:01.625 --> 30:03.708
Audience members:
Wooo! Yeah, baby!

30:03.708 --> 30:05.708
Kai: We're gonna play
a song for you.

30:05.708 --> 30:08.208
It's called "Alien Like You."

30:08.666 --> 30:10.666
Kai: Took me a
while to finish it,

30:10.666 --> 30:11.916
so you're the first ones

30:11.916 --> 30:15.208
to hear this song
in its entirety.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.125
What the hell
are you doing?

30:17.125 --> 30:19.916
Come on, man.

You'll need to, uh, sign

32:32.291 --> 32:34.333
You got balls, playing
your song like that.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.000
Good job, huh?

32:37.000 --> 32:38.125
Nice work.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.541
(stunned laughter)

32:41.541 --> 32:42.625
Kai!

32:42.625 --> 32:45.958
That was incredible!

32:45.958 --> 32:46.625
Thank you.

32:46.625 --> 32:47.708
I mean, it was just...

32:47.708 --> 32:48.458
It was...

32:48.458 --> 32:49.541
It was perfect!

32:49.541 --> 32:52.875
And I am so glad
that you sang that song.

32:52.875 --> 32:54.875
I'm sorry, I don't
mean to be rude,

32:54.875 --> 32:58.083
but I have a terrible
memory for names.

32:58.083 --> 33:00.083
Who are you again?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.666
I'm nobody,
I'm just a fan.

33:07.083 --> 33:08.500
Thank you.

33:16.833 --> 33:18.750
Kai: Shit...

33:26.291 --> 33:27.333
(door opens,
keys jingle)

33:27.333 --> 33:28.666
Hey, there.
Where were you?

33:28.666 --> 33:30.833
Erica: Look, I'm sorry,
I shoulda left a message.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.333
But I just
got caught up

33:32.333 --> 33:34.833
and then, before I knew it,
it was late and...

33:34.833 --> 33:36.083
Hey, did you
have dinner?

33:36.083 --> 33:38.083
There's some left over
pasta in the fridge.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.166
If you're hungry,
I could heat it up.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.708
No, thanks, I'm not
really hungry.

33:41.708 --> 33:43.250
Um...

33:43.583 --> 33:44.958
Look, Ethan...

33:47.958 --> 33:49.166
(sighing)

33:49.166 --> 33:51.708
There's a lot going on
in my head right now

33:51.708 --> 33:55.208
and I kinda need
to talk about it.

33:55.208 --> 33:57.125
Okay, let's talk.

33:58.500 --> 34:01.958
Okay, well, I... I met with
Julianne today.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.125
And I told her that

34:04.125 --> 34:07.166
I am gonna go into
business with her.

34:07.166 --> 34:08.166
I see.

34:09.166 --> 34:10.500
Okay, well...

34:10.500 --> 34:12.250
What do you expect
me to say?

34:12.250 --> 34:14.250
I want you to say
that you understand

34:14.250 --> 34:16.833
and that you get how much
this means to me.

34:16.833 --> 34:18.125
I can't
because I don't.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.333
I don't understand

34:19.333 --> 34:21.166
why you wanna take on
that kind of stress

34:21.166 --> 34:22.750
and turn your life
upside down.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.000
Because it's exciting
and it's challenging.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.500
And I know that you're
just looking out for me,

34:27.500 --> 34:29.125
but please,

34:29.875 --> 34:31.958
just back me up
on this one.

34:31.958 --> 34:32.958
Okay?

34:34.083 --> 34:36.416
No. I'm sorry.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.500
Ethan,
it's my career.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.666
Yes, but this is our life
together, Erica.

34:42.666 --> 34:44.708
We have to start thinking
about the future

34:44.708 --> 34:45.708
and what we want.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.958
Okay, and what is that,
exactly?

34:47.958 --> 34:50.458
Ethan: Not this, not you
running from job to job

34:50.458 --> 34:51.708
and getting
fired one day

34:51.708 --> 34:53.333
and then opening a
business the next.

34:53.333 --> 34:55.458
I mean, come on.

34:55.458 --> 34:57.625
You know, if the situation
was reversed, I would--

34:57.625 --> 34:59.000
You'd support me.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.666
I'm being a shitty boyfriend
because I'm being honest.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.416
No, look, that's not
what I'm saying.

35:02.416 --> 35:04.375
Well, the situation
wouldn't be reversed,

35:04.375 --> 35:06.416
'cause I wouldn't
do this.

35:06.416 --> 35:08.875
So, there's nothing
else that you want?

35:08.875 --> 35:12.750
I mean, you've,
you've got it all?

35:12.750 --> 35:15.833
Yes. I have a career
that I love,

35:15.833 --> 35:17.750
and good friends.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.750
And I have you.

35:23.916 --> 35:26.250
And in ten years
from now?

35:26.250 --> 35:27.416
Ten years?

35:29.291 --> 35:31.708
We're married,
we have kids,

35:31.708 --> 35:34.208
a dog and a house.

35:34.208 --> 35:36.291
And I'm still teaching,
and you're working,

35:36.291 --> 35:38.291
and life's simple.

35:39.291 --> 35:41.833
And we'll be happy.

35:41.833 --> 35:43.500
(sighs heavily)

35:46.166 --> 35:47.708
Hey...

35:47.708 --> 35:48.791
Are you crying?

35:48.791 --> 35:50.500
No. I'm not crying,
I'm not crying.

35:50.500 --> 35:51.750
I'm just...

35:53.750 --> 35:55.291
I am freaking out
right now.

35:55.291 --> 35:56.916
I thought you
wanted this.

35:56.916 --> 35:57.916
I did.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.000
But right now
we are...

36:02.000 --> 36:05.833
We are in completely
different places.

36:05.833 --> 36:07.583
And there's this voice
inside of me

36:07.583 --> 36:09.416
that is telling me something
that I don't wanna hear.

36:09.416 --> 36:10.125
Erica, look...

36:10.125 --> 36:13.166
And I'm trying so hard
not to hear it.

36:17.875 --> 36:21.958
I don't think that
we're right for each other.

36:22.416 --> 36:23.416
What?

36:25.583 --> 36:26.750
(choked breath)

36:28.041 --> 36:31.041
and there's no amount
of talking

36:31.041 --> 36:32.541
that's gonna fix it,
Ethan.

36:32.541 --> 36:34.000
It's just...

36:34.000 --> 36:36.416
It's a fundamental difference
between us.

36:36.416 --> 36:39.791
You know,
whether it's our sex life,

36:40.625 --> 36:43.083
or my career,
or the future...

36:43.083 --> 36:44.250
I mean every time

36:44.250 --> 36:46.583
I try to step outside
of the box a little,

36:46.583 --> 36:50.375
it's like you keep
trying to push me in.

36:50.958 --> 36:54.125
And I think that
we should break up.

36:54.125 --> 36:55.750
Erica, don't.

36:56.750 --> 36:57.791
You're overreacting.

36:57.791 --> 36:58.916
We're just having
a conversation.

36:58.916 --> 37:00.958
You don't just
give up because--

37:00.958 --> 37:03.791
Ethan, I am not
giving up.

37:05.416 --> 37:07.916
But if we keep going,

37:07.916 --> 37:11.416
we're gonna keep pulling
in different directions

37:11.416 --> 37:14.416
until we tear this
thing apart.

37:14.416 --> 37:17.041
And even though...

37:17.041 --> 37:18.208
I can't...

37:18.208 --> 37:21.250
Stand the thought of you
not in my life...

37:22.250 --> 37:26.041
I also can't keep shutting out
this voice inside of me

37:26.041 --> 37:29.416
that's telling me
that this isn't right.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.583
I can't believe
this is happening.

37:33.583 --> 37:35.000
I'm sorry.

37:36.833 --> 37:38.041
I'm sorry.

37:39.041 --> 37:39.875
(crying)

37:47.625 --> 37:49.541
Ethan, I'm sorry.

37:52.833 --> 37:54.916
Please, Ethan.

37:58.833 --> 37:59.916
Ethan...

38:01.333 --> 38:02.333

It's fine, Jude.

39:53.583 --> 39:55.708
This place has a lot
of memories -

39:55.708 --> 39:57.166
good memories.

39:57.166 --> 39:58.541
Okay, well...

39:58.541 --> 40:00.041

a table,

You won't find him here.

I kind of knew that.

40:20.583 --> 40:22.333
He quit yesterday.

40:22.333 --> 40:23.416
But Jody signed the band,

40:23.416 --> 40:25.166
he's already got
them working on

40:25.166 --> 40:27.250

40:37.458 --> 40:39.416
You remember
what it was like.

40:39.416 --> 40:41.000
I do.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.083

40:47.291 --> 40:48.708

41:31.625 --> 41:32.708
Hello, Erica.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.500
Where have you been?

41:35.500 --> 41:37.666
Waiting...

41:37.666 --> 41:38.708
Until you were ready.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.666
I broke up with Ethan.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.708
I know.

41:44.708 --> 41:47.708
Kai, he's gone back
where he belongs.

41:47.708 --> 41:49.125
I have no job,

41:50.250 --> 41:51.666
no boyfriend...

41:51.666 --> 41:54.250
And how does that feel?

41:54.250 --> 41:56.166
It feels scary,

41:57.375 --> 41:59.166
but strangely, okay.

42:00.125 --> 42:01.916
And why is that?

42:08.333 --> 42:09.916
It's like...

42:10.125 --> 42:12.166
Talking to Ethan,

42:12.166 --> 42:15.625
it made me realize
how much I've changed.

42:15.625 --> 42:18.000
Everything that
you've taught me,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.333
it's made me
braver somehow.

42:21.458 --> 42:23.458
And fear, it no longer
holds me back.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.000
It...

42:25.000 --> 42:29.458
It actually motivates me,
if that makes sense.
