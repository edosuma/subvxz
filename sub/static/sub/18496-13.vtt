00:17.379 --> 00:19.465
El Gato!

00:36.730 --> 00:39.987
<b>4x13 - The Bloodwolf</b>

02:26.008 --> 02:29.595
Hah! These Bloodwolves may be strong,
but they can be beaten!

02:29.678 --> 02:31.221
Poor, foolish Puss.

02:31.930 --> 02:34.349
These are only das Blutwolf's avatars.

02:34.433 --> 02:37.728
Das Blutwolf himself cannot
be stopped.

02:37.811 --> 02:40.439
Except by the One
from the Great Prophecy.

02:41.732 --> 02:44.067
And she is gone, thanks to you.

02:44.151 --> 02:47.029
She was kind to you.
And you led her to her doom.

02:47.112 --> 02:49.448
I did not know she would be harmed.

02:51.575 --> 02:54.703
Und I do not care.
I have done what I had to do!

02:54.786 --> 02:58.915
When this is over, you will pay
for what you have done.

02:58.999 --> 02:59.958
Hmph!

03:03.503 --> 03:05.756
Huh?

03:10.010 --> 03:14.264
Behold! Das Blutwolf comes now!

03:27.235 --> 03:28.779
Huh?

04:14.825 --> 04:17.160
Huh!

04:21.957 --> 04:24.209
You!

04:25.043 --> 04:27.421
You are the One from the Great Prophecy?

04:28.422 --> 04:32.300
I... I...

04:32.384 --> 04:35.971
You fear me, little cat. I know you do.

04:36.263 --> 04:38.473
I am the source of all fear.

04:38.557 --> 04:41.309
I have existed since before time began,

04:41.393 --> 04:43.437
and after I am done with this world,

04:43.520 --> 04:46.440
fear will be the only thing left.

04:47.065 --> 04:49.234
I... I fear nothing!

04:49.317 --> 04:51.611
You fear me!

05:16.052 --> 05:18.096
You fear me!

05:18.680 --> 05:21.057
You all fear me!

05:23.435 --> 05:25.729
And your fear feeds me.

05:25.812 --> 05:29.733
Your fear will give me the power
I need to destroy your world!

05:29.816 --> 05:32.736
I do not fear.

05:32.819 --> 05:35.906
There is only one who does not fear me.

05:36.198 --> 05:40.327
One whose heart is so pure,
it does not know fear.

05:40.410 --> 05:44.956
And you, little cat, are not that one.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.044
Oh, great Blutwolf.

05:49.127 --> 05:52.339
I am your faithful servant,
Ulschalk SÃ¼ndenbock.

05:52.422 --> 05:55.467
It is I who summoned you
back from the Netherworld,

05:55.550 --> 05:58.678
und I who arranged
the opening of the portal.

06:04.184 --> 06:10.065
Yes. Yes, I can see in your mind
all you have done.

06:11.233 --> 06:14.194
And I should be grateful?

06:14.277 --> 06:16.613
Oh, well, you know, I don't expect much.

06:16.696 --> 06:18.615
Maybe after you decimate the Earth,

06:18.698 --> 06:22.494
I could rule over the wasteland
as a mighty warlord?

06:22.577 --> 06:24.371
Nothing big.

06:24.454 --> 06:27.374
Hmm. No.

06:27.457 --> 06:28.708
Whoa!

06:29.584 --> 06:31.419
You will be destroyed.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.172
You will all be destroyed!

06:34.256 --> 06:37.884
This Earth will be no more!

06:43.473 --> 06:45.559
Oh!

06:52.023 --> 06:53.358
Who are you?

06:53.441 --> 06:56.611
I have slumbered here 1,000 years,

06:56.695 --> 07:01.408
awaiting the arrival of the One
from the Great Prophecy.

07:01.491 --> 07:04.619
And I must tell you...

07:06.413 --> 07:08.790
I really need a cup of coffee.

07:09.416 --> 07:10.250
Huh?

07:14.838 --> 07:16.840
Oh, much better.

07:16.923 --> 07:20.552
Now, I imagine you have many questions.

07:20.969 --> 07:22.262
Oh, yes, I, uh...

07:22.721 --> 07:23.972
Am I dead?

07:24.264 --> 07:26.016
And are my ears really that big?

07:26.099 --> 07:27.934
Of course you're not dead!

07:28.310 --> 07:32.022
You haven't passed through the Seven Rings
or the Veil of Resounding.

07:32.105 --> 07:33.106
The what?

07:33.189 --> 07:35.442
You are in the Realm of Shades.

07:35.525 --> 07:39.779
It was created by the Great Mage Sino
in preparation for the day

07:39.863 --> 07:42.449
the Bloodwolf would escape
the Netherworld.

07:42.532 --> 07:45.118
So, Sino knew this would happen.

07:45.201 --> 07:46.828
Oh, you bet he did!

07:46.912 --> 07:51.291
He is so smart! You have no idea.

07:51.875 --> 07:55.253
- Who are you?
- I am a Tulpa.

07:55.337 --> 07:56.713
A-A Tulpa?

07:57.297 --> 07:58.798
A Tulpa.

07:58.882 --> 08:01.843
A kind of thought-form
conjured by a sorcerer.

08:01.927 --> 08:05.639
I am one of three magical spirits
Sino created.

08:07.057 --> 08:08.725
You may call me...

08:09.309 --> 08:10.435
Orange?

08:10.518 --> 08:12.687
Oh, that's not a name, it's a fruit.

08:12.771 --> 08:13.855
I thought it was a color.

08:14.272 --> 08:16.066
It's both. Anyway...

08:16.441 --> 08:18.485
We can't stand around talking all day.

08:18.568 --> 08:20.320
If I'm the One from the Great Prophecy,

08:20.403 --> 08:22.030
I have to do something.

08:22.113 --> 08:24.532
I need to get back to San Lorenzo.

08:24.616 --> 08:26.368
You will, Dulcinea.

08:26.451 --> 08:30.997
And I have something that just
might help you defeat the Bloodwolf.

08:31.081 --> 08:34.042
But I warn you, the chance is small.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.419
And if you do succeed,

08:36.503 --> 08:40.173
you will be doomed to eternal torment!

08:40.256 --> 08:41.091
Oh.

08:45.053 --> 08:47.973
Do you have any honey?
I like a little honey in my coffee.

08:48.056 --> 08:49.057
It's cozy.

08:52.310 --> 08:55.146
I hunger after my long imprisonment.

08:56.856 --> 08:57.816
You!

08:59.109 --> 09:01.403
What drives your nightmares?

09:01.486 --> 09:03.488
What turns your guts to ice?

09:03.571 --> 09:07.033
What is your greatest fear?

09:17.752 --> 09:22.257
Delicious. I must have more.

09:41.526 --> 09:43.695
Rust!

09:43.778 --> 09:45.905
Spiders!

09:50.827 --> 09:52.662
I'm not even doing anything.

09:56.082 --> 09:58.001
This is too easy.

09:58.585 --> 10:02.338
But you! You are the bravest of them all.

10:02.422 --> 10:05.633
And thus, your fear will be the sweetest.

10:05.925 --> 10:09.637
It will give me the power
I need to end your world.

10:11.473 --> 10:13.475
What is it, little cat?

10:13.558 --> 10:16.728
What is it that you fear the most?

10:19.314 --> 10:21.733
No!

10:25.070 --> 10:27.489
What? Where is the scream?

10:28.323 --> 10:30.116
You have made a mistake, dog.

10:30.575 --> 10:32.952
The thing you have shown me
has already happened.

10:33.036 --> 10:36.081
So now, I have nothing left to fear.

10:36.164 --> 10:39.125
No! This is impossible!

10:40.001 --> 10:41.753
A wise lady once said to me,

10:41.836 --> 10:44.255
"Being brave does not mean
that fears have you none,

10:44.339 --> 10:47.509
it means you face up to your fears
and do what must be done."

10:48.718 --> 10:51.471
And now, I see the fear in you!
Hah!

10:56.309 --> 10:58.061
Puss is fighting back!

10:58.144 --> 11:03.650
Well, if he can fight,
so can we!

11:33.763 --> 11:36.349
- A necklace?
- An amulet.

11:36.933 --> 11:38.434
It looks like a necklace.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.313
Okay, but if you call it an amulet,
it sounds more impressive.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.441
You want me to fight the Bloodwolf
with a necklace?

11:45.525 --> 11:46.901
That's crazy!

11:46.985 --> 11:51.364
The amulet has the power
to return you to the real world.

11:51.447 --> 11:53.783
And to send the Bloodwolf back here.

11:54.075 --> 11:57.036
Only you can activate the amulet,

11:57.120 --> 11:59.205
by touching it to your forehead.

11:59.289 --> 12:03.501
Once it's activated, you'll only have
a few seconds to use it.

12:04.669 --> 12:07.422
- I mean, that sounds pretty...
- But! Whoever uses the amulet

12:07.505 --> 12:10.258
to send the Bloodwolf here
will come as well.

12:10.341 --> 12:14.470
And remain trapped here with him
for all eternity.

12:14.554 --> 12:16.848
Ooh...

12:16.931 --> 12:20.727
And he's super gross,
so it'll just be so nasty.

12:21.728 --> 12:23.521
It's... It's just...

12:24.188 --> 12:25.857
I know.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.568
Dulcinea, you don't have to do this.

12:28.651 --> 12:30.612
You can stay here and be safe.

12:32.906 --> 12:33.948
I'll do it.

12:36.075 --> 12:37.702
Sino knew that you would.

12:37.785 --> 12:40.288
That's why you are the One.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.458
Thank you, Orange.
It was nice to meet you.

12:43.541 --> 12:45.335
I've never met a Tulpa before.

12:47.545 --> 12:50.757
You never... You never met a Tulpa!

12:50.840 --> 12:51.925
Why is that funny?

12:52.342 --> 12:54.010
Someday, you'll find out.

12:54.093 --> 12:56.054
Now go, save the world!

12:56.554 --> 12:58.181
You can do it!

13:04.312 --> 13:06.522
Oh, man! I forgot to tell you!

13:06.606 --> 13:08.900
You gotta get close enough
to touch the Bloodwolf,

13:08.983 --> 13:10.944
with the amulet for it to work.

13:11.027 --> 13:13.237
That was kind of important.

13:13.321 --> 13:16.324
What do you want,
I've been asleep for 1,000 years.

13:16.407 --> 13:17.408
Bye, now!

13:17.492 --> 13:19.202
Good luck! Love you!

13:26.793 --> 13:27.919
Hah!

13:28.002 --> 13:30.046
Artephius, is it time?

13:30.129 --> 13:31.172
For what?

13:31.756 --> 13:32.966
Kid, look out!

13:48.606 --> 13:52.860
Fellow cowards of San Lorenzo,
today is our day!

13:53.611 --> 13:55.071
But you go first.

14:25.143 --> 14:27.478
Your courage is impressive, little cat.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.189
It's almost a shame
that you have no chance.

14:30.273 --> 14:33.443
Keep talking, dog.
I will find a way past your defenses.

14:33.860 --> 14:35.486
Like this!

14:42.910 --> 14:44.662
I have no more time for this.

14:45.246 --> 14:49.542
Soon, the blood moon will rise,
and it will be time.

14:49.959 --> 14:52.086
Beneath the moon of Walpurgisnacht,

14:52.670 --> 14:57.842
I will taste the screams of the dying,
as I end your world.

14:57.925 --> 15:01.804
And now, let this battle end!

15:09.479 --> 15:10.646
You see?

15:10.730 --> 15:13.483
You have no chance, little cat.

15:13.566 --> 15:16.235
You are not the One.

15:16.819 --> 15:20.031
I know. The One is dead.

15:20.114 --> 15:21.282
Because of you!

15:24.869 --> 15:28.081
Before long, the blood moon will rise.

15:28.164 --> 15:33.127
And with the One gone,
there is no one to stop me!

15:39.050 --> 15:39.884
Huh?

15:50.895 --> 15:52.271
No!

15:57.777 --> 15:58.945
Dulcinea!

15:59.028 --> 16:00.196
She is alive!

16:02.073 --> 16:04.867
And she has Sino's vile amulet!

16:04.951 --> 16:06.619
You must die!

16:06.702 --> 16:07.787
Watch out!

16:18.506 --> 16:19.549
No!

16:21.759 --> 16:22.885
Dulcinea!

16:24.720 --> 16:26.013
I thought I had lost you!

16:26.347 --> 16:28.516
Uh. Not quite.

16:29.016 --> 16:31.185
This amulet can stop the Bloodwolf,

16:31.269 --> 16:33.312
but I have to get close enough
to touch him.

16:33.396 --> 16:34.856
- I will do it!
- No!

16:34.939 --> 16:36.816
Only I can activate it.

16:36.899 --> 16:39.277
Please, Puss. You have to keep him busy.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.486
I will do this!

16:42.071 --> 16:43.531
Senior Puss Squad,

16:44.949 --> 16:48.578
let us teach a very old dog
some very new tricks!

17:07.597 --> 17:09.223
Huh?

17:31.621 --> 17:33.289
Come on! Come on!

17:51.724 --> 17:53.017
The blood moon!

17:53.100 --> 17:57.230
Mortals! Your world ends now!

17:58.314 --> 18:01.192
I think not!

18:18.084 --> 18:21.754
Fools! All your efforts
are as nothing to me!

18:23.256 --> 18:25.716
Now I am become death,

18:25.800 --> 18:28.636
the destroyer of worlds!

18:45.778 --> 18:46.779
Goodbye.

18:53.661 --> 18:56.414
No!

18:58.124 --> 18:59.875
Oh! No!

19:01.586 --> 19:05.172
And still, you try to please me, Uli.

19:05.506 --> 19:07.133
Have you learned nothing?

19:08.593 --> 19:09.927
I have learned...

19:11.971 --> 19:13.180
to do good.

19:26.861 --> 19:27.903
I'm sorry.

19:54.680 --> 19:55.681
Uli.

19:58.643 --> 20:00.144
- What is happening?
- Oh, no!

20:00.853 --> 20:02.855
What's happening?

20:04.857 --> 20:10.029
You guys! The big dog statue thingy
is, like, sinking or some junk!

20:19.705 --> 20:22.667
Where? What is this place?

20:25.378 --> 20:27.129
The Realm of Shades.

20:27.213 --> 20:31.592
Your new home, now and for all eternity.

20:32.176 --> 20:34.428
You cannot keep me here!

20:34.512 --> 20:36.180
I will destroy you!

20:37.056 --> 20:39.016
I'm sorry, I'm not in right now.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.811
Leave a message at the tone.
Boop.

20:41.977 --> 20:43.354
Huh?

20:43.437 --> 20:49.110
My work is done.
But two Tulpas still remain.

20:53.906 --> 20:55.658
It is all right, mein friend.

20:55.741 --> 20:57.868
I will be here to entertain you.

20:59.328 --> 21:02.915
Forever, und ever, und ever, und ever.

21:04.834 --> 21:07.294
No! No!

21:07.378 --> 21:10.756
No!

21:21.934 --> 21:23.144
Exactly!

21:24.186 --> 21:27.523
My friends, we have stopped
an unspeakable beast,

21:27.606 --> 21:29.275
from destroying our world.

21:29.859 --> 21:31.527
And now that his statue is gone,

21:31.610 --> 21:34.321
perhaps you can erect a new statue.

21:39.744 --> 21:44.331
To Dulcinea. The greatest hero
the world has ever known!

21:49.170 --> 21:51.046
To Dulcinea!

21:56.802 --> 22:01.015
At last, we can enjoy
a safe and secure San Lorenzo,

22:01.098 --> 22:02.516
free of danger!

22:10.232 --> 22:11.776
To Dulcinea!
