WEBVTT

00:25.092 --> 00:28.160
Roscoe: You are going
to love this.

00:28.162 --> 00:31.230
Roscoe, you've got
that mad scientist look.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.265
I thought you liked that look.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.401
Only when
we're planning
something together.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.336
You're up to something.

00:37.338 --> 00:40.072
So, uh, the band ready
for the audition?

00:40.074 --> 00:41.206
Don't try to change the subject.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.208
I wanna know what you're up to.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.045
Can't I surprise
my best friend with a gift?

00:46.047 --> 00:47.913
You got me a gift?

00:47.915 --> 00:51.250
Samantha, meet beta.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.123
Samantha:
It's adorable!

00:57.124 --> 00:59.391
But you know
I'm allergic to cats.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.361
Not this one. Watch.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.800
It's a hologram?

01:07.802 --> 01:08.734
30 million pixels.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.036
Man: Roscoe,
are you up there?
Uh-oh.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.371
That's so sweet.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.939
Roscoe!
Yeah, dad, um,

01:13.941 --> 01:15.107
I'm just, uh...

01:15.109 --> 01:16.442
Testing some holographic...

01:16.444 --> 01:19.111
cat scans.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.396
I gotta go.

01:20.397 --> 01:21.680
Don't forget the audition.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.652
Whoa! Whoa!

01:33.443 --> 01:35.760
Why is there
a plaid cat in my lab?

01:35.763 --> 01:37.262
Well, you said I could, uh,

01:37.264 --> 01:39.231
Test your holographic
programming.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.167
Uh, skygraph is about
to pull all my funding,

01:42.169 --> 01:43.902
And you're making
holographic cats?

01:44.738 --> 01:46.405
Roscoe: Why not?

01:46.406 --> 01:48.073
Low maintenance
companion. It could
make millions.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.341
Beta, no!

01:49.343 --> 01:50.809
Wait! Stop!

01:50.811 --> 01:52.478
Don't you go out...

01:52.480 --> 01:54.580
This computer is not a toy.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.249
Look, I didn't develop
this technology

01:57.251 --> 01:59.318
For your entertainment, son.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.154
At least I use it.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.288
I mean, if you wanna
keep your funding,

02:03.290 --> 02:04.656
Then make something with it

02:04.658 --> 02:06.975
Instead of just
talking about it.

02:06.976 --> 02:09.293
Hey, why... why don't you
show beta to skygraph?

02:09.295 --> 02:13.465
They may actually
be impressed...

02:13.467 --> 02:15.934
Even if you're not.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.726
Hey, cindy. Rachel.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.528
Hey, I didn't think
you'd make it.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.362
I wouldn't miss it.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.197
Hey, mrs. Connors.
Hey, roscoe.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.698
Rachel: Deep
cleansing breaths.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.635
Deep cleansing breaths.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.237
Deep cleansing breaths.

02:52.239 --> 02:55.007
Deep cleansing breaths.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.176
Rachel. You're not
having a baby.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.410
It's just an audition.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.679
No, see, it's not
just an audition.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.414
Daryl fibbs could be here.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.583
Get real.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.318
Actually, cindy, I have heard

03:06.320 --> 03:07.753
That daryl fibbs
is scouting local clubs

03:07.755 --> 03:09.021
For harshtone records.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.155
Yeah, see?

03:10.157 --> 03:12.257
Omm.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.259
Why do you encourage her?

03:15.062 --> 03:20.065
Zettabytes!
You're up.

03:25.239 --> 03:31.210
 You may find me
just a little strange 

03:31.212 --> 03:37.649
 I like dancin' barefoot
in the pourin' rain 

03:38.252 --> 03:43.422
 my mind is racin'
at the speed of light 

03:44.458 --> 03:50.295
 I'll dance around you
like a satellite 

03:51.465 --> 03:54.766
 I'm reckless 

03:54.768 --> 03:56.235
 you're speech... 

03:56.237 --> 03:58.437
Ok!

03:58.439 --> 04:01.440
All right. All right.
Put the brakes on.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.874
Is something wrong, mr, moxley?

04:02.876 --> 04:05.210
Do you sing lead
on all the songs?

04:05.212 --> 04:07.579
Uh, pretty much, yeah.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.215
Ok, luv, put down the guitar.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.150
Let's see you move.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.320
Eh. You mean, dance?

04:15.322 --> 04:16.988
Dance. Strut.

04:16.991 --> 04:19.491
Show some personality,
some presence.

04:19.493 --> 04:22.294
Uh, mr. Moxley,
I really don't think...

04:22.296 --> 04:25.130
Well, good for you!
Thinking's overrated.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.766
All right.
Gimme some, uh, britney.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.568
Gimme some jagger.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.350
Thank you!

04:45.352 --> 04:47.252
That'll be all.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.455
"moist toilet!"

04:50.457 --> 04:52.791
"towelette.
Moist towelette!"

04:52.793 --> 04:54.092
You didn't let them finish.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.161
What are you, their manager?

04:56.163 --> 04:57.262
Do 'em a favor.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.930
Put 'em out of their misery.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.199
Hey, they sounded great.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.134
Yeah, but...

05:02.136 --> 05:04.836
It's not about sound anymore.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.172
It's about image.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.607
Luv,

05:08.608 --> 05:10.041
You can't sing lead for a band

05:10.044 --> 05:12.077
If you can't do the moves.

05:12.780 --> 05:17.349
Moist towelette.
You're up.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.153
 Don't even try it 

05:21.155 --> 05:23.955
 no, no, no,
don't you understand? 

05:23.957 --> 05:27.192
 Don't even try it 

05:27.194 --> 05:29.828
 say good night,
say good-bye 

05:29.830 --> 05:32.197
 don't even try it 

05:32.199 --> 05:33.298
 no 

05:33.300 --> 05:35.500
 you better keep away
with your hands 

05:35.502 --> 05:37.903
 don't even try it 

05:37.904 --> 05:40.305
Now that's what
I'm talking about.
 say good night 

05:40.307 --> 05:44.576
 say good-bye,
don't even try 

05:53.520 --> 05:55.387
Roscoe: Anybody
can learn to dance.

05:55.389 --> 05:59.491
Trust me, roscoe.
You don't wanna
go there.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.226
Ok, nobody's perfect, ok?

06:01.228 --> 06:02.828
Oh, ok.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.730
It's not just
the dancing anyway, sam.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.765
It's attitude, personality.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.167
Yeah, it's
an inner connection
to the music.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.268
I've got a connection.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.437
After all, I write the songs...

06:12.439 --> 06:14.740
And a real personality.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.342
Well, no one cares about real.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.078
They want larger than life.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.648
She's right, sam.

06:26.453 --> 06:30.355
There's way too much
negative energy here.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.034
Hey.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.370
Writin' down some new lyrics?

06:45.372 --> 06:47.406
Yeah. Can you think
of anything

06:47.408 --> 06:50.475
That rhymes with
pain and misery?

06:55.416 --> 06:57.582
Hey. All the years
we've been friends,

06:57.584 --> 07:00.051
Have I ever
given you bad advice?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.987
Always.

07:01.989 --> 07:05.323
So I'm due for some good advice.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.629
Look...

07:10.631 --> 07:11.963
You write awesome songs.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.232
Maybe it's just time
you let someone else
sing them...

07:14.234 --> 07:18.236
An addition to the band,
not a replacement.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.539
Oh.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.975
Ok.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.079
Here.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.816
Save this.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.150
Your original lyric sheets

07:32.152 --> 07:34.453
Will be worth a fortune someday.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.354
See, that's what I like
about you, roscoe.

07:36.356 --> 07:39.691
You're always...

07:39.693 --> 07:40.826
Looking to the future.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.495
Yeah, tell my father.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.697
To him, my vision
is never grand enough.

07:45.699 --> 07:49.434
I wish there was some secret

07:49.436 --> 07:52.504
To being everything
people wanted us to be.

07:53.974 --> 07:54.873
Yeah, well...

07:54.875 --> 07:56.208
Until someone
bottles perfection,

07:56.210 --> 07:59.010
I guess we're stuck
with what we've got.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.652
So how are things
in your part of the world?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.020
All right, I guess.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.689
Things are
a little rough
for sam right now.

08:10.691 --> 08:14.226
Mmm. I couldn't think
of a more perfect match.

08:16.230 --> 08:20.031
Dad, sam and I are just friends.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.199
So what's the problem?

08:21.201 --> 08:22.167
I don't know.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.202
I mean, she's fun to be with.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.704
But she gets so moody.

08:25.706 --> 08:29.241
She's talented.
But she can be
so stubborn.

08:29.243 --> 08:31.910
I like her. But...

08:32.679 --> 08:33.812
See?
That's the problem.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.147
How do you get past
all those buts?

08:36.149 --> 08:37.515
Ship them off to china.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.484
What?

08:39.486 --> 08:41.352
Overnight. Every
last one of 'em. We...

08:41.355 --> 08:42.386
They... they need
the technology.

08:42.389 --> 08:46.324
We've got a surplus.
It's a match made in heaven.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.360
Thanks for the help.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.229
What?

08:52.766 --> 08:55.667
So, you have a good day, huh?

08:59.506 --> 09:01.840
Nice tone, luv.
But can you move?

09:10.083 --> 09:11.449
Nice tone.

09:11.451 --> 09:14.753
Nice tone.
But can you move?

09:14.755 --> 09:15.755
Move.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.093
All right.
Oh, my god.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.363
Just take it... god.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.866
Ok, which version?

09:27.868 --> 09:30.168
Yes! Ok.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.578
Roscoe: Yes!

09:54.294 --> 09:59.064
Girl, shouting:
My life is a library book
that I forgot I took!

09:59.066 --> 10:02.267
I dropped it in the sand,
and I owe 100 grand!

10:02.269 --> 10:04.302
My life is a library book!

10:04.304 --> 10:06.805
My life is a dumb school song

10:06.807 --> 10:08.306
That I keep singing wrong!

10:08.308 --> 10:11.176
Oh, hail to our school,
I feel like a fool!

10:11.178 --> 10:13.511
My life is a dumb school song!

10:13.513 --> 10:18.316
My life is a math exam,
and I forgot to cram!

10:18.318 --> 10:20.185
The teacher's got some nerve,

10:20.187 --> 10:22.287
And someone blew the curve!

10:22.289 --> 10:24.189
My life is a math exam!

10:24.191 --> 10:27.425
My life is a bad school lunch.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.194
It ain't no Sunday brunch!

10:29.196 --> 10:32.430
I try to scarf it down
but it comes back around!

10:32.432 --> 10:36.101
My life is a bad school lunch!

10:36.470 --> 10:39.938
Wow. That was
really...

10:40.273 --> 10:42.007
Something.

11:00.227 --> 11:04.162
 Can't you hear
the captain shouting 

11:04.164 --> 11:09.601
 dinah, blow your horn 

11:11.004 --> 11:13.638
I just loved you guys
at my sister's sweet 16.

11:13.640 --> 11:19.444
I would do anything
to be your lead singer.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.383
Rache? Can I borrow

11:25.385 --> 11:29.254
Some of your deep
cleansing breath?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.322
So what do we do now?

11:31.324 --> 11:33.091
Sweet 16s and bar mitzvahs.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.926
'cause that's all
we'll be getting.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.194
We'll just run the ad again.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.997
You're just avoiding
the obvious, you guys.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.100
Anybody with talent
is already in a band.

11:42.102 --> 11:46.271
The zettabytes
have gone as far
as we're gonna go, ok?

11:51.278 --> 11:52.711
Excuse me.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.180
I'm here for the audition.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.348
I don't see her on the list.

11:57.350 --> 12:01.586
Um, we're looking
for someone with
a wide vocal range

12:01.588 --> 12:02.520
Who can also dance.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.023
So if you can't dance...

12:05.025 --> 12:06.057
I can dance.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.260
Do you know
<i>nothing's wrong with me?</i>

12:26.480 --> 12:32.383
 You may find me
just a little strange 

12:32.619 --> 12:38.757
 I like dancin' barefoot
in the pourin' rain 

12:38.759 --> 12:44.295
 my mind is racin'
at the speed of light 

12:44.297 --> 12:50.802
 I'll dance around you
like a satellite 

12:50.804 --> 12:53.605
 I'm reckless 

12:53.607 --> 12:55.640
 you're
speechless 

12:55.642 --> 12:58.176
 scream, shout,
I love it loud 

12:58.178 --> 13:01.946
 I feel the need
to stand out in a crowd 

13:01.948 --> 13:06.017
 nothin's wrong with me 

13:06.019 --> 13:07.585
 nothin's wrong with me 

13:07.587 --> 13:09.854
 freak out,
and stand my ground 

13:09.856 --> 13:13.591
 nothin' in the world
is gonna keep me down 

13:13.593 --> 13:19.430
 nothin's wrong with me 

13:29.476 --> 13:31.209
Rachel: Wow.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.611
Where did you learn
to move like that?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.880
Uh, you don't learn
to move like that, sam.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.215
It kinda comes
with the hardware.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.318
Um, I don't think
I caught your name.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.520
Loretta.
Loretta modern.

13:42.522 --> 13:46.291
Well, ha, it's nice to meet you.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.664
Sorry about that.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.065
Surprise.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.234
Ladies...

13:56.236 --> 13:58.303
Meet your new lead singer.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.876
Roscoe: My father's
been working on
holographic technology

14:04.878 --> 14:06.177
And artificial intelligence
for skygraph.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.413
He just hasn't applied it
to human form.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.216
She's so real.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.918
You're in my liver.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.020
Eww.
Roscoe:
Don't worry about it.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.922
She doesn't have a liver.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.390
Well, I know where
it's supposed to be.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.659
She pulls whatever
information she needs

14:21.661 --> 14:22.927
Right off the net.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.162
That means,
she knows everything.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.063
It's incredible.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.764
I don't even see a projector.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.532
She doesn't need one.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.766
The computer uses echo location

14:28.768 --> 14:30.568
To measure the room

14:30.569 --> 14:32.369
And pulsing frequencies
to hold her pattern.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.005
Here, watch this.

14:38.278 --> 14:43.014
I can change her hair,
her eyes, her whole look.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.851
Cindy: Wow,
that is so cool.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.189
I love this outfit.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.626
This is just plain weird.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.912
Rachel: No, it's fantastic.

14:56.913 --> 14:59.197
Cindy: Can you imagine
going back to moxley
with her singing lead?

14:59.199 --> 15:01.199
Roscoe: As long as no one
tries to touch her,

15:01.201 --> 15:02.934
Nobody will ever know.

15:10.644 --> 15:11.876
Loretta: Roscoe?

15:11.878 --> 15:12.477
Yeah?

15:12.479 --> 15:14.412
Can you give me a hand?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.314
Well, sure. With what?

15:16.316 --> 15:18.283
I mean, a hand.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.985
Oh, yuck. Ew.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.220
How many times
do I have to tell you?

15:22.222 --> 15:24.256
You have to stay away

15:24.257 --> 15:26.291
From windows and doors
that lead outside.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.692
Why?

15:27.693 --> 15:29.092
Holograms
can only exist indoors.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.429
I can't tell you how many times
I've lost the cat.

15:31.431 --> 15:35.300
We'll have to build you
a new hand from scratch.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.336
Hey, roscoe,

15:38.338 --> 15:39.938
Does your father
know about loretta?

15:39.940 --> 15:41.456
Are you kidding?

15:41.457 --> 15:42.973
If he finds out,
he'll delete her.

15:45.278 --> 15:49.414
Then I suggest
we hide her. Fast.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.955
Roscoe: Press the button
every time the alarm stops.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.324
It's good for about 5 minutes.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.940
Savor it now.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.109
Defeated by technology.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.945
Cindy: I love it.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.280
Rachel: What's that?

16:22.282 --> 16:23.381
Hologram storage cell.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.767
My dad invented it.

16:25.768 --> 16:28.152
Thinks these two
were stolen by competition.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.655
You are so bad.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.359
Roscoe:
All righty. Ready
for bed, loretta?

16:36.229 --> 16:38.396
Ciao, everyone.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.245
Roscoe on answering machine:
Hey, this is roscoe.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.314
Leave a message.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.582
Sam: Hey, roscoe,
it's samantha.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.617
If you're there, pick up.

17:01.421 --> 17:05.823
Um, ok. Just call me
when you get back.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.258
All right. Bye.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.363
Why didn't you talk to her?

17:12.365 --> 17:17.234
I... I always
screen my calls
when I'm busy.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.269
It's no big deal.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.238
Dad: Roscoe?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.440
I gotta hide you.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.912
Uh, hey, dad.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.113
Who you talking to?

17:29.115 --> 17:32.417
Uh, no one, no one.
My-my-myself.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.820
Huh.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.527
Wow.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.563
Impressive.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.033
Yeah. Yeah, well,
it's... it's just a hand.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.635
Well, why don't we
team up and work
on this together?

17:50.637 --> 17:51.736
I... I don't...
I don't need help.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.703
I just think that I could...

17:52.705 --> 17:55.306
Maybe some...
Some other time.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.375
All right, fine.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.970
Roscoe: It's simple, max.

18:08.971 --> 18:10.654
All you have to do is plug in
the quadratic formula,

18:10.657 --> 18:12.774
And solve for "x."

18:12.775 --> 18:14.892
How can I do that?
I don't know what "x" is.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.928
Come on, max.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.396
Your mother's
the head of skygraph.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.499
Some of those brains
must have trickled down.

18:24.838 --> 18:27.572
Well, you keep workin' on this.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.339
I'll be right back.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.175
Wait!
Where are you goin'?

18:31.177 --> 18:33.311
Come on!
What's more important,

18:33.313 --> 18:36.681
Some girl or my math test?

18:36.683 --> 18:38.282
Roscoe: Sam, wait up.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.284
Hi.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.385
Hey.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.486
I haven't seen you all week.

18:41.487 --> 18:42.587
Yeah, well, you know,
I've been workin'
pretty hard

18:42.589 --> 18:43.921
Fine-tuning loretta.

18:43.923 --> 18:47.391
I want her to be just right
for her first gig.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.928
First gig?

18:50.930 --> 18:52.363
What do you know that I don't?

18:52.365 --> 18:54.432
Are you gonna go
to the dance on Saturday?

18:54.434 --> 18:56.434
Well, that depends.
Are you asking me?

18:56.436 --> 18:58.669
What's the point in asking

18:58.671 --> 19:01.205
If you're gonna be
on stage the whole time?

19:01.207 --> 19:03.841
What do you mean?

19:03.843 --> 19:06.310
The infectious measles
are playing.

19:06.312 --> 19:09.113
Aren't they?

19:12.852 --> 19:14.318
This over here.
Is this on?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.954
Hello? Excuse me.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.390
Wow.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.993
I know all of you here
are waiting

19:21.995 --> 19:24.395
To catch the infectious
measles tonight.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.233
Um, I'm sorry to say

19:29.235 --> 19:32.403
That the infectious measles
won't be performing

19:32.405 --> 19:36.874
As their lead singer
has the chicken pox.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.645
But, uh, some of your
very own schoolmates

19:40.647 --> 19:44.916
Have volunteered
to fill in for them.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.052
Now, now, come on.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.188
Don't be disparaging, ok?

19:50.190 --> 19:51.522
All right.
Now remember,

19:51.524 --> 19:53.991
Don't let any
of the band members
get too close,

19:53.993 --> 19:54.892
Or they'll pass
right through you.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.929
It's so sweet. It's like
he's her mother.

19:57.931 --> 20:00.198
We could have done this
without her.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.034
So put your hands together

20:03.036 --> 20:05.336
For the zettabytes!

20:13.213 --> 20:15.346
Sam: Uh...

20:15.348 --> 20:17.181
1, 2, 3, 4!

20:24.224 --> 20:29.393
 You may find me just
a little strange 

20:29.395 --> 20:34.198
 I like dancin' barefoot
in the pourin' rain 

20:34.200 --> 20:41.272
 my mind is racin'
at the speed of light 

20:41.274 --> 20:46.877
 I'll dance around you
like a satellite 

20:46.879 --> 20:52.149
 I'm reckless,
you're speechless 

20:52.151 --> 20:54.552
 scream, shout,
I love it loud 

20:54.554 --> 20:58.322
 I feel the need
to stand out in a crowd 

20:58.324 --> 21:02.159
 nothin's wrong with me 

21:02.161 --> 21:04.328
 nothin's wrong with me 

21:04.330 --> 21:06.764
 freak out
and stand my ground 

21:06.766 --> 21:10.134
 nothin' in the world
is gonna keep me down 

21:10.136 --> 21:14.739
 nothin's wrong with me 

21:18.811 --> 21:24.682
 I see some things that
might not come out right 

21:24.984 --> 21:30.688
 I say them loud and proud
and in the light 

21:31.124 --> 21:36.327
 if you ask
about my attitude 

21:37.363 --> 21:38.929
 I'll say come on 

21:38.931 --> 21:41.365
 just get a clue 

21:41.668 --> 21:44.335
 scream, shout,
I love it loud 

21:44.337 --> 21:47.972
 I feel the need
to stand out in a crowd 

21:47.974 --> 21:52.009
 nothin's wrong with me 

21:52.011 --> 21:53.377
 nothin's wrong with me 

21:53.379 --> 21:55.780
 freak out
and stand my ground 

21:55.782 --> 21:59.150
 nothin' in the world
is gonna keep me down 

21:59.152 --> 22:02.286
 nothin's wrong with me 

22:02.288 --> 22:05.156
 nothin's wrong with me 

22:05.158 --> 22:08.359
 nothin's wrong with me 

22:08.361 --> 22:11.629
 nothin's wrong with me 

22:11.631 --> 22:16.367
 nothin's wrong with 

22:16.369 --> 22:21.205
 me 

22:31.818 --> 22:34.185
My name is loretta modern,

22:34.187 --> 22:36.520
And we are the zettabytes.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.035
Loretta: This is
so fun, roscoe.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.603
Can we do this every day?

22:52.605 --> 22:55.406
Well, let's first see
if you can photograph.

22:55.408 --> 22:56.240
If you're just tuning in,

22:56.242 --> 22:57.908
Our guest today is daryl fibbs.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.611
So what made
the notorious de fibb
give up rap

23:00.613 --> 23:02.413
And take a job with
harshtone records?

23:02.415 --> 23:06.183
I... I decided I wanted
to be a star maker
instead of a star.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.119
That's why I'm scouting new acts

23:08.121 --> 23:10.221
In back rooms where
I'll discover talent.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.622
That's somebody
we should get to know.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.191
But to give up performing...

23:14.193 --> 23:18.562
Loretta?
Well, I mean,
it's like boxing.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.364
The champ...

23:22.402 --> 23:24.535
Roscoe: How do you
like the rain?

23:24.537 --> 23:25.636
Loretta: I don't know.

23:25.638 --> 23:29.039
It only happens outside.

23:30.443 --> 23:33.277
I can't go outside.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.316
So how should I look now?

23:39.318 --> 23:41.051
What?

23:41.053 --> 23:42.453
For your pictures.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.555
Oh, uh, right. Um...

23:44.557 --> 23:45.656
Let's see.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.793
Uh, first, uh, look at me

23:48.795 --> 23:51.228
Like you're surprised.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.830
Great. All right.

23:52.832 --> 23:56.734
Now, uh, look at me
like you're angry.

23:57.403 --> 24:01.972
Ok, now, uh,
look at me like
you're in love.

24:05.178 --> 24:07.344
Is this right?

24:08.781 --> 24:10.414
Yeah.

24:11.951 --> 24:15.386
Yeah, it's...
It's perfect.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.027
Hmm.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.131
Loretta:
They're all the same.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.467
It's like I'm not really there.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.802
You're like lightning.
You know, it's hard
to catch in a picture.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.371
But it's still there, like you.

24:34.373 --> 24:37.475
Why am I here?

24:37.476 --> 24:40.578
You're here
'cause the zettabytes
need a new lead singer.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.781
Do you know why you're here?

24:43.783 --> 24:45.649
Um...

24:45.651 --> 24:50.421
Maybe I'm here
to bottle perfection.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.289
What I mean is,

24:52.291 --> 24:55.192
Maybe I'm here to make you.

25:04.537 --> 25:08.205
Roscoe, dude,
you gotta set me up
with loretta.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.542
Max, dude, loretta doesn't date.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.043
So? Convince her.

25:13.045 --> 25:16.413
Come on. Help out
a fellow skygraph brat.

25:16.415 --> 25:18.182
Hey...

25:18.184 --> 25:20.050
Too bad about your dad,
by the way.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.386
My... my dad?
What happened to my dad?

25:22.388 --> 25:23.854
Between you and me,

25:23.856 --> 25:26.423
My mom's been talkin' about
shuttin' down his project.

25:26.425 --> 25:27.758
Not enough results.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.692
What? When?

25:28.694 --> 25:30.728
I don't know. I...
I could talk to her,

25:30.730 --> 25:32.363
Get him out of the penalty box.

25:32.365 --> 25:35.833
That is, if you help me.

25:46.913 --> 25:47.711
Hey.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.414
Studying hard?

25:50.416 --> 25:52.182
It's a new lyric.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.351
I'm writing it to match
our new image.

25:54.353 --> 25:56.387
I'm sure loretta will love it.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.088
She'll like whatever you like.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.890
Yeah.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.691
Um... Look,
I was thinking...

26:01.694 --> 26:06.297
Maybe we could
go out for dinner
on... on Saturday.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.069
I'd really like that, roscoe.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.203
Great! Yeah.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.406
I figure
we can make it
a double date.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.141
With who?

26:17.143 --> 26:18.709
Max mcallister.

26:18.711 --> 26:21.345
Max?

26:23.115 --> 26:25.883
Wait a second.
You can't be...

26:25.885 --> 26:26.917
I made a deal with him.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.486
And loretta can't
be there without me.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.388
You can't be serious.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.090
It could help save
my father's job.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.993
Besides, loretta needs
social experience.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.778
So do you.

26:37.779 --> 26:39.562
Why does everything
have to be such
a battle with you?

26:39.565 --> 26:43.000
I'm sorry I can't
be agreeable 24/7
like loretta.

26:43.002 --> 26:46.303
Yeah, so am I.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.440
Oh, I'm sor...
I didn't mean that.

26:49.442 --> 26:53.310
Yes, you did.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.879
Sam...

27:01.087 --> 27:03.187
Max: So I
checked the creep
into the boards,

27:03.189 --> 27:05.273
And I scored the winning goal.

27:05.274 --> 27:07.358
Wow, what a story.
Isn't that a great story,
loretta? She loves hockey.

27:07.360 --> 27:11.328
The ducks are up 4 to 3
in the third period.

27:11.330 --> 27:15.065
Max: Really?
How'd you know that?

27:16.369 --> 27:17.501
She's psychic.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.302
No way!

27:18.304 --> 27:19.487
Ha ha. Sam's kidding.

27:19.488 --> 27:20.671
It's... it's right here
on my... my computer.

27:20.673 --> 27:25.576
Dude... Do you have to
take that thing everywhere
you go?

27:27.380 --> 27:28.545
So... Loretta...

27:28.547 --> 27:30.814
Tell me a little
about yourself.
Where you from?

27:30.816 --> 27:32.950
She's visiting.
She's an exchange student.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.451
We're hosting her.
Wow.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.421
I gotta get into
the hosting business.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.726
So, what country are you from?

27:42.728 --> 27:44.294
Oh, well, she's from...
Antarctica.

27:44.296 --> 27:47.297
Max: No way!

27:47.299 --> 27:52.002
Mean winter temperatures
are 74 degrees below zero,

27:52.004 --> 27:54.304
5.5 million square miles.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.205
Max: Amazing.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.373
And you don't even have
an accent.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.376
Sam: She came here
to escape 6 months
of darkness.

27:59.378 --> 28:03.847
Of course, not all of us
can be so lucky.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.983
You know what you want?

28:05.985 --> 28:06.884
Oh, I don't eat.

28:06.886 --> 28:10.320
Meat. Meat.
She doesn't eat meat.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.740
Vegan. Cool.

28:12.741 --> 28:15.159
We'll have
the 1/2 pound burger...
And the veggie plate?

28:15.161 --> 28:17.261
Just fries for us.

28:20.199 --> 28:25.169
You have the smoothest hands
I have ever seen.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.104
Ooh! Do that again!

28:30.176 --> 28:31.542
Hello?

28:31.543 --> 28:32.909
You changed my
holographic protocols,
didn't you?!

28:32.912 --> 28:35.946
Dad, this is
a really bad time.
I'm on a date.

28:35.948 --> 28:38.449
I don't care where you are.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.818
Here.

28:45.691 --> 28:47.474
Dad, just calm down, ok?

28:47.475 --> 28:49.258
You deliberately
altered my programs.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.295
No. I made it
more efficient.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.097
You know, when I first
saw you on stage,

28:53.099 --> 28:54.932
I thought we had
a connection between us.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.233
I mean, really deep down.

28:56.235 --> 29:00.237
To tell you the truth,
I really don't go that deep.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.606
Neither do I.
See, it's perfect.

29:02.608 --> 29:05.909
I think I'm gonna be sick.

29:10.316 --> 29:13.784
Max, can I just melt
in your arms?

29:13.786 --> 29:16.386
Why don't you?

29:16.388 --> 29:17.488
You have to kiss me first.

29:17.490 --> 29:22.126
Whoa! Look at
the desserts
at this place!

29:23.062 --> 29:25.295
Loretta, get a grip.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.564
Talk to the hand.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.099
Um... Uh...

29:29.101 --> 29:31.168
Oh... oh, no, my keys.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.604
Max, would you
go get them for me?

29:33.606 --> 29:36.306
Yeah. Sure.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.147
Hey, what about my kiss?

29:43.149 --> 29:46.083
I asked him first.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.229
I gotta go.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.834
Hurry, roscoe!

30:13.512 --> 30:15.345
Sam: Here he comes.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.649
Where did loretta go?

30:18.651 --> 30:20.384
Uh... Getting some air.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.153
She... she was feeling
light-headed.

30:23.155 --> 30:26.557
Some of us call that love.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.966
Ooh.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.235
What's she doing over there?

30:38.237 --> 30:43.607
Oh... Just popping in
on some old friends.

30:49.215 --> 30:53.250
Well, that was
the most unusual date
I've ever been on.

30:54.553 --> 30:58.088
You gotta admit it was fun.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.824
Um, look...

31:00.826 --> 31:05.229
I, uh... I need you to do
one more thing for loretta.

31:05.231 --> 31:08.365
Can we just once
not talk about loretta?

31:08.367 --> 31:10.200
I need you to keep her
for a while.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.436
You're asking the wrong person.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.238
I can't even
keep a hamster alive.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.873
She's not a pet.
She's a person.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.107
She's a program.

31:17.109 --> 31:20.944
Look, if I keep her,
my dad will find her,

31:20.946 --> 31:23.747
And then you'll lose
your lead singer.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.382
Come on.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.384
It'll be good for her.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.286
You can teach her
how to be real.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.455
Hmm?

31:32.391 --> 31:34.424
Please?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.329
After you.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.367
That's great,
ms. Connors.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.169
Thank you, roscoe.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.671
I see where samantha
gets it from.

32:20.673 --> 32:25.309
Well... I never quite had
her determination. Ha.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.778
So, uh, is sam inside?

32:27.780 --> 32:31.848
Yeah. She's studying
with that new girl?

32:36.355 --> 32:40.958
The answer is 3 times
the square root of 2.

32:40.960 --> 32:41.925
It's my homework.

32:41.927 --> 32:44.194
I've got to be
the one to
get it right.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.163
But you got it wrong.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.398
That's how you learn.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.632
You get it wrong
until you get it right.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.033
That's such a waste of time.

32:50.035 --> 32:54.938
That just goes to show
that you don't know
everything.

32:54.940 --> 32:57.274
Yes, I do.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.142
Ok, maybe you do.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.311
But you don't understand
any of it.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.280
You could know what a baby is...

33:03.282 --> 33:05.983
But you've never been one.

33:05.985 --> 33:08.986
You can know every type
of bicycle,

33:08.988 --> 33:11.955
But you've never fallen off one

33:11.957 --> 33:13.357
And scraped your knee.

33:13.359 --> 33:14.858
You've never had
to try and fail.

33:14.860 --> 33:19.696
Try and fail until...
You get something right.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.232
Hey, girls.
How's studying going?

33:22.234 --> 33:25.335
She's mad because I'm perfect.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.704
I don't even know
why I talk to her.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.039
She's not even real.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.240
She's just a trick of light.

33:30.242 --> 33:34.211
And you're nothing but water
and a few pounds of chemicals.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.045
Ooh.

33:35.047 --> 33:36.146
Maybe a few more pounds

33:36.148 --> 33:37.881
Than you really need.

33:41.420 --> 33:42.519
It's not fair!

33:42.521 --> 33:45.689
I can't even smack her!

33:45.691 --> 33:47.424
He screens your calls.

33:47.425 --> 33:49.158
Ok, I think we've all
gotta calm down

33:49.161 --> 33:51.261
Just a little bit.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.162
You screen my calls?

33:52.164 --> 33:55.365
Well... Don't think
about that right now.

33:55.367 --> 33:58.168
Sam, why don't you show loretta

33:58.170 --> 34:00.771
The song you wrote for her.

34:00.773 --> 34:02.205
You wrote a song for me?

34:02.207 --> 34:05.776
I wrote it for the band!

34:06.545 --> 34:08.311
With you in mind.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.148
Could I hear it?

34:15.054 --> 34:16.453
Fine.

34:37.109 --> 34:39.708
 Here's the story
of a girl 

34:39.710 --> 34:42.579
 livin' in a lonely world 

34:42.581 --> 34:45.148
 a hidden note,
a secret crush 

34:45.150 --> 34:48.485
 a little boy
who talks too much 

34:48.487 --> 34:51.388
 well, I'm standing
in a crowd 

34:51.389 --> 34:53.956
 and when you smile
I check you out 

34:53.958 --> 34:57.294
 but you don't even
know my name 

34:57.296 --> 34:59.896
 you're too busy
playin' games 

34:59.898 --> 35:05.268
 and I want you to know 

35:05.270 --> 35:10.841
 if you lose your way
I won't let you go 

35:10.843 --> 35:14.578
 if I cut my hair,
if I change my clothes 

35:14.580 --> 35:17.147
 will you notice me? 

35:17.149 --> 35:20.283
 If I bite my lip,
if I say hello 

35:20.285 --> 35:23.653
 will you notice me? 

35:23.655 --> 35:28.158
 What's it gonna take
for you to see 

35:28.160 --> 35:33.697
 to get you to notice me? 

35:41.773 --> 35:45.809
 Oh, don't get me wrong 

35:45.811 --> 35:46.776
 get me wrong 

35:46.778 --> 35:48.211
 you better make your move 

35:48.213 --> 35:51.047
 before the moment's gone 

35:51.049 --> 35:53.517
 tell me
if I cut my hair 

35:53.519 --> 35:58.221
 if I change my clothes
will you notice me? 

35:58.223 --> 36:01.158
 If I bite my lip,
if I say hello 

36:01.160 --> 36:04.895
 will you notice me? 

36:08.467 --> 36:12.369
 I'll get you
to notice me 

36:16.008 --> 36:18.408
I... I... uh...
I'm very impressed.

36:18.410 --> 36:22.712
Ok, you girls got a slot
on amateur night.

36:22.714 --> 36:23.880
Amateur night?

36:23.882 --> 36:24.581
Trust me on this.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.516
Harshtone records is sending

36:26.518 --> 36:27.684
A talent scout.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.552
Daryl fibbs?

36:28.554 --> 36:30.320
You didn't hear it from me.

36:30.322 --> 36:33.023
Cindy: Whoo! Ha!

36:33.025 --> 36:34.224
I can't believe it.

36:34.225 --> 36:35.424
We get to perform
for daryl fibbs.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.094
Oh, my god!

36:37.095 --> 36:38.762
We have to spend
every free moment
rehearsing.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.530
Uh, you saw loretta in there...

36:40.532 --> 36:42.199
She doesn't need rehearsal.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.334
She might not, but we do.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.936
Yeah.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.938
Guys. So...

36:47.940 --> 36:50.173
Moxley's having you
close the first half.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.410
Good one, loretta.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.246
Wait a second.
She's not in there.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.949
You took
the data cell
and left loretta?

36:58.951 --> 37:01.418
I thought you had put her in.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.321
That's how you take care of her?

37:13.232 --> 37:15.899
Loretta, I am so sorry.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.400
That's ok.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.302
I've been enjoying the rain.

37:19.304 --> 37:22.239
I can't believe
sam left you
out here.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.874
I don't know what
I would have done

37:24.876 --> 37:26.710
If I lost you.

37:28.780 --> 37:32.382
I mean, if the band lost you.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.353
You ready?

37:37.055 --> 37:39.155
It must be wonderful.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.825
What?

37:41.827 --> 37:43.960
To feel the rain.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.153
Roscoe's out, honey.

38:10.155 --> 38:11.521
You can wait for him
if you like.

38:11.523 --> 38:15.025
Uh, I just wanted to
drop off this new demo.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.192
Sure.

38:16.194 --> 38:20.397
Voice: Save me... Please.

38:21.700 --> 38:25.268
Save me... Please.

38:26.271 --> 38:29.739
Save me... Please.

38:30.475 --> 38:34.344
Save me... Please.

38:34.346 --> 38:38.448
Save me... Please.

38:39.318 --> 38:41.851
Save... aah!

38:47.859 --> 38:52.429
So, this is where
you got your voice,
huh, loretta?

39:00.372 --> 39:03.740
Some gene pool roscoe gave you.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.799
Hey.

39:32.270 --> 39:33.169
Sam.

39:33.171 --> 39:36.439
Sam, what's wrong?

39:43.248 --> 39:46.549
Moxley: Mr. Fibbs.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.185
I... I can't tell you
what an honor it...

39:49.187 --> 39:50.437
Spare me, moxley.

39:50.438 --> 39:51.688
You gave me no respect
when I performed here.

39:51.690 --> 39:55.592
I expect the same
lack of courtesy now.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.161
I'm messin' with you, man,

39:58.764 --> 39:59.963
Oh, you brought the media.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.931
I don't leave home
without it.
Yeah.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.233
Heh heh. Hey.

40:03.235 --> 40:06.035
Girls:
Hey, it's fibbs! Fibbs!

40:06.037 --> 40:07.537
 I got a good excuse 

40:07.539 --> 40:10.740
 I'm only 17 thinkin'
that you better leave 

40:10.742 --> 40:12.542
 I'm not naive 

40:12.544 --> 40:13.476
 I know you don't believe 

40:13.478 --> 40:15.745
 when you say
you're just a... 

40:15.747 --> 40:18.782
 Man, don't even try it 

40:18.784 --> 40:20.784
 no, no, no, no,
don't you understand? 

40:20.786 --> 40:24.421
 Don't even try it 

40:24.423 --> 40:26.389
 say good night,
say good-bye 

40:26.391 --> 40:29.793
 don't even try it, no 

40:29.795 --> 40:32.228
 you better keep away
with your hands 

40:32.230 --> 40:34.330
 don't even try it... 

40:34.332 --> 40:35.331
He's here.

40:35.332 --> 40:36.331
You guys, daryl fibbs is here.

40:36.334 --> 40:39.602
Hey, don't faint
until after we perform.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.305
I can't believe
sam isn't here yet.

40:42.307 --> 40:43.840
Lighten up.
You're too hard on her.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.275
She's got loretta.
What if I need
to make

40:45.277 --> 40:46.643
Some last-minute
adjustments on her?

40:46.645 --> 40:49.345
I can't believe she'd be
this irresponsible.

40:49.347 --> 40:52.315
Now you sound like your father.

40:52.317 --> 40:53.683
Sam: Oh, we got stuck
in traffic.

40:53.685 --> 40:54.751
As long as you're here.

40:54.753 --> 40:57.821
Seriously, you had us worried.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.189
Thanks, mom.

40:59.191 --> 41:01.624
Bye. Good luck,
honey.

41:01.626 --> 41:02.759
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.828
Bye, sweetie.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.162
Roscoe:
Do you have loretta?

41:06.164 --> 41:07.164
Diva in a drum.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.799
Look, my hands are shaking.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.768
I think I'm gonna hurl.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.304
Yeah, but it's
a deep cleansing
hurl, right?

41:18.276 --> 41:20.210
Are we there yet?

41:20.879 --> 41:22.846
You're on in a few minutes.

41:22.848 --> 41:23.980
How do I look?

41:23.982 --> 41:25.782
Is my contrast set right?

41:25.784 --> 41:27.617
You look great.

41:27.619 --> 41:30.286
Perfect.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.522
Come on, let's check out
our competition.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.290
 Don't even try it 

41:34.292 --> 41:36.359
 I know you
all too well 

41:36.361 --> 41:37.160
 say good night... 

41:37.162 --> 41:39.696
It was the picture, wasn't it?

41:39.698 --> 41:41.331
When were you
planning on
telling me

41:41.333 --> 41:42.799
That you used me to make her?!

41:42.801 --> 41:45.168
I didn't think it was important.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.403
I guess I should
be happy for you.

41:47.405 --> 41:50.039
You finally bottled perfection.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.307
I made her for you, not for me.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.376
If you're not gonna
be honest with me,

41:53.378 --> 41:55.245
At least be honest
with yourself.

41:55.247 --> 41:57.714
What?!

41:58.250 --> 42:01.017
I just want to know
what part of me

42:01.019 --> 42:03.319
You used to make her.

42:04.389 --> 42:07.590
What part of me
did you like enough
to keep?

42:09.561 --> 42:11.995
I gave her your ears.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.100
I wish you'd never made her.

42:17.102 --> 42:19.202
 What part of no
don't you understand? 

42:19.204 --> 42:22.672
 Don't even try it 

42:29.281 --> 42:31.080
Ok, ok, ok!

42:31.082 --> 42:34.117
Now we have a real treat
for you next,

42:34.119 --> 42:40.356
An all-girl band that I
personally discovered.

42:40.358 --> 42:44.027
And now the earsplitter
presents...

42:44.029 --> 42:48.131
Loretta modern
and the zettabytes!

43:04.916 --> 43:07.917
 Here's the story
of a girl 

43:07.919 --> 43:10.386
 livin'
in a lonely world 

43:10.388 --> 43:13.156
 a hidden note,
a secret crush 

43:13.158 --> 43:16.125
 a little boy
who talks too much 

43:16.127 --> 43:18.895
 well, I'm standing
in the crowd 

43:18.897 --> 43:22.298
 and when you smile
I check you out 

43:22.300 --> 43:25.301
 but you don't even
know my name 

43:25.303 --> 43:27.804
 you're too busy
playing games 

43:27.806 --> 43:33.343
 and I want you to know 

43:33.345 --> 43:35.178
 if you lose your way 

43:35.180 --> 43:39.115
 I won't let you go 

43:39.117 --> 43:40.516
 if I cut my hair 

43:40.518 --> 43:42.285
 if I change my clothes 

43:42.287 --> 43:45.021
 will you notice me? 

43:45.023 --> 43:48.157
 If I bite my lip,
if I say hello 

43:48.159 --> 43:51.194
 will you notice me? 

43:51.596 --> 43:55.765
 What's it gonna take
for you to see 

43:55.767 --> 44:00.169
 to get you
to notice me? 

44:00.171 --> 44:01.471
 I'm not like the rest 

44:01.473 --> 44:04.841
 I just don't care
if you're the best 

44:04.843 --> 44:07.543
 you see, it's
all the same to me 

44:07.545 --> 44:13.449
 you just be
who you want to be 

44:13.451 --> 44:18.688
 it's all the same to me 

44:20.792 --> 44:26.129
 oh, don't get me wrong 

44:26.131 --> 44:27.730
 you better
make your move 

44:27.732 --> 44:30.667
 before the moment's gone 

44:30.669 --> 44:33.536
 tell me
if I cut my hair 

44:33.538 --> 44:34.904
 if I change my clothes 

44:34.906 --> 44:37.173
 will you notice me? 

44:37.175 --> 44:40.743
 If I bite my lip,
if I say hello 

44:40.745 --> 44:44.147
 will you notice me? 

44:53.591 --> 44:56.592
Roscoe: Come on. Come on!

45:01.499 --> 45:03.399
Girl: What's going on?

45:10.075 --> 45:11.507
What was that?!

45:11.509 --> 45:14.243
Girl: She's not real.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.513
Girl: She's a hologram.

45:17.515 --> 45:18.948
A holographic rock star?

45:18.950 --> 45:21.951
Com... come on!
Come on!

45:21.953 --> 45:23.853
Holographic rock star.

45:23.855 --> 45:26.155
How cool is that!

45:26.391 --> 45:29.358
Have you ever seen
anything like it?

45:31.196 --> 45:32.261
That's unreal.

45:43.541 --> 45:50.213
All, chanting: Lo-re-tta!
Lo-re-tta! Lo-re-tta.

45:50.215 --> 45:52.148
Lo-re-tta!

45:52.383 --> 45:54.817
Yeah, patch me through
to weldon giles.

45:56.321 --> 45:57.321
Man, on phone: Hello?

45:57.322 --> 45:58.822
Mr. Giles,
it's me, daryl.

45:58.823 --> 46:00.323
You must have found something
if you're calling so late.

46:00.325 --> 46:04.761
Only harshtone's
next media sensation.

46:04.763 --> 46:06.462
Listen to this.

46:06.464 --> 46:11.834
All: Lo-re-tta!
Lo-re-tta...

46:13.304 --> 46:16.105
Good work, fibbs.

46:16.107 --> 46:17.173
Make it happen.

46:31.322 --> 46:32.855
Loretta, thank you so much

46:32.857 --> 46:34.590
For being with us today.

46:34.591 --> 46:36.324
So, tell me, where does
a hologram find

46:36.327 --> 46:38.261
Those cutting-edge
fashions?

46:38.263 --> 46:41.364
I download them.
Don't you?

46:41.366 --> 46:43.599
 'cause I know
you know I know 

46:43.601 --> 46:47.637
 that if we plan
on winning 

46:47.639 --> 46:49.172
 come on, come on
come on 

46:49.174 --> 46:51.307
 come on, come on 
 get real 

46:51.309 --> 46:54.110
 we want to
make it appealing 

46:54.112 --> 46:57.113
 I'll be whatever
you're feeling 

46:57.115 --> 46:59.182
 allow me to get you
to the dealing 

46:59.184 --> 47:02.351
 get up, get on,
get over it 

47:02.353 --> 47:05.621
 get over me 

47:05.623 --> 47:07.857
 it's time to get real 

47:08.626 --> 47:11.360
 everybody says
if we dream bigger 

47:11.362 --> 47:13.663
 than we are... 

47:13.665 --> 47:15.898
It's unnatural,
it's unwholesome...

47:15.900 --> 47:17.800
She is completely harmless.

47:17.802 --> 47:19.302
What's next, holographic pets?

47:19.304 --> 47:21.370
I've got a holographic pet.

47:21.372 --> 47:23.206
 I know you know
I know 

47:23.208 --> 47:26.909
 this time
there's no pretending 

47:26.911 --> 47:31.347
 come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on 

47:31.349 --> 47:34.917
 what else can we do... 

47:34.919 --> 47:36.719
So tell us, mr. Fibbs,

47:36.721 --> 47:37.887
How is it working with loretta?

47:37.889 --> 47:40.223
It's amazing.
You're with her
5 minutes,

47:40.225 --> 47:41.875
You forget she's not real.

47:41.876 --> 47:43.526
Well, the buzz
from the live shows
is undeniable,

47:43.528 --> 47:45.928
But will her debut album
live up to the hype?

47:45.930 --> 47:47.263
We're recording it right now.

47:47.265 --> 47:49.165
It's gonna be hot.

48:00.378 --> 48:01.778
 Get real 

48:01.779 --> 48:03.179
 we want
to make it appealing 

48:03.181 --> 48:04.046
 get real 

48:04.048 --> 48:06.949
 I'll be whatever
you're feeling 

48:06.951 --> 48:09.385
Ok, girls, girls, girls.

48:09.387 --> 48:10.737
What now?!

48:10.738 --> 48:12.088
Can we at least get
through the song once?

48:12.090 --> 48:13.356
You want to make a harshtone cd?

48:13.358 --> 48:14.624
Then you have to do it right.

48:14.626 --> 48:16.359
Your harmonies were flat.

48:16.361 --> 48:17.627
Was I ok?

48:17.629 --> 48:18.694
Daryl:
You were brilliant.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.530
Cindy, you need
to keep the tempo
consistent.

48:21.532 --> 48:22.932
What take are we on?

48:22.934 --> 48:24.500
Engineer: 34.

48:24.501 --> 48:26.067
Is it too late
to get studio musicians?

48:26.070 --> 48:27.303
Engineer:
Never too late.

48:27.305 --> 48:30.740
Mr. Fibbs,
the intercom's still on.

48:30.742 --> 48:33.910
Can he replace us
with studio musicians?

48:33.912 --> 48:34.877
He can do whatever he wants.

48:34.879 --> 48:38.247
Daryl, you can't
replace the girls.

48:38.249 --> 48:41.284
They're my band.

48:42.253 --> 48:44.287
All right, loretta,
whatever you say.

48:44.289 --> 48:45.621
Engineer:
Meter's still running.

48:45.623 --> 48:47.089
Daryl: Yeah,
I own the meter.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.556
At least I will
when their first album
goes platinum.

48:48.559 --> 48:52.061
Yeah, uh, mr. Fibbs,
we should break
for the day, anyway.

48:52.063 --> 48:53.429
I gotta work on loretta.

48:53.431 --> 48:55.564
Try and increase
her range of motion.

48:55.566 --> 48:57.099
Daryl: Ok, we'll
pick it up later.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.935
The national broadcast
is only a week away,

48:58.937 --> 49:01.871
And I want the single
done by then.

49:03.675 --> 49:05.841
I'm working on my own song.

49:05.843 --> 49:07.460
Your own song?

49:07.461 --> 49:09.078
You're amazing, you know that?

49:09.514 --> 49:11.247
Take a good look,
because that...

49:11.249 --> 49:13.449
Is the future
of the music industry.

49:13.451 --> 49:14.483
A month from now,

49:14.485 --> 49:15.351
Every teenager in america

49:15.353 --> 49:17.353
Is gonna want to be
just like her...

49:17.355 --> 49:20.189
Smart, talented...

49:20.191 --> 49:22.291
High resolution.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.260
Album title.

49:27.365 --> 49:31.033
Take care of my girl, roscoe.

49:31.336 --> 49:33.669
<i>Your</i> girl?

49:35.940 --> 49:39.742
Hey, you guys sounded great.

49:40.678 --> 49:42.111
You're gonna have
a killer first album.

49:42.113 --> 49:45.514
Hmm. You mean
loretta will.

49:45.516 --> 49:47.333
Yeah.

49:47.334 --> 49:49.151
Look, I'm sorry
she's getting
all the attention.

49:49.153 --> 49:50.286
Are you?

49:50.288 --> 49:52.455
I mean, that's why
you made her, right?

49:52.457 --> 49:53.556
The band needed an image.

49:53.558 --> 49:56.292
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

49:56.627 --> 49:57.660
Things just aren't turning out

49:57.662 --> 50:00.096
The way I wanted, all right?

50:02.467 --> 50:05.334
You've still got
that extra data cell,
don't you?

50:05.336 --> 50:08.971
Why don't you take loretta
for a while? Huh?

50:08.973 --> 50:10.172
Then they could
do a story on you

50:10.174 --> 50:12.341
And how the two of you
are friends.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.310
We are?

50:15.213 --> 50:17.279
You could try to be.

50:18.249 --> 50:19.482
Tell you what, roscoe,

50:19.484 --> 50:21.083
If she becomes too much for you,

50:21.085 --> 50:22.752
E-mail her to me.

50:30.194 --> 50:32.261
Dad, what are you doing?

50:32.263 --> 50:33.263
Studying your creation.

50:33.264 --> 50:34.096
How did you compensate

50:34.098 --> 50:35.097
For the ambient room light?

50:35.099 --> 50:36.332
Uh, variable
intensity
sub-routine.

50:36.334 --> 50:38.234
Dad, please, you're
embarrassing her.

50:38.236 --> 50:39.568
It's ok, roscoe.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.303
I don't mind.

50:41.773 --> 50:45.441
Hey, dad,
you need to warn her
before you do that.

50:45.443 --> 50:47.710
I have to hand it
to you, roscoe.

50:47.712 --> 50:50.679
What you have done here
is amazing.

50:50.681 --> 50:52.748
Of course,
a holographic rock star

50:52.750 --> 50:54.383
Isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

50:54.385 --> 50:55.084
Dad, don't start.

50:55.086 --> 50:56.419
But she's a good beginning.

50:56.421 --> 51:00.322
Now let's just move beyond it.

51:00.958 --> 51:03.092
Why can't you just appreciate

51:03.093 --> 51:05.227
What you've got
right in front of you?
I mean, you saw her.

51:05.229 --> 51:08.130
But did you see who she is?
Who she's becoming?

51:08.132 --> 51:10.199
She can't become
anything. Sh...

51:10.201 --> 51:11.201
It... it's a hologram.

51:11.202 --> 51:12.935
No,<i> she's</i> an individual.

51:12.937 --> 51:14.870
She has thoughts and feelings,

51:14.872 --> 51:16.372
Just like
you and me.
No.

51:16.374 --> 51:19.108
She's a blend
of light and color.

51:19.110 --> 51:20.242
Like...

51:20.244 --> 51:21.410
Well, like an abstract painting.

51:21.412 --> 51:22.611
It's vibrant, it's beautiful,

51:22.613 --> 51:26.315
But in the end,
it's just something
to look at,

51:26.317 --> 51:28.150
Nothing more.

51:28.152 --> 51:29.919
Really?

51:29.921 --> 51:32.822
Well, that nothing
saved you
your funding.

51:32.824 --> 51:35.958
Thanks to her,
you're skygraph's
favorite employee.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.626
That wasn't her.
That was you.

51:37.628 --> 51:39.795
By creating her,
you might have...

51:39.797 --> 51:43.199
You might have even
saved my job.

51:43.734 --> 51:45.801
Glad you noticed.

51:45.803 --> 51:48.237
I'm going for a walk.

51:59.183 --> 52:02.985
Roscoe, I wrote a song.

52:04.522 --> 52:07.756
Tell me it's brilliant.

52:07.758 --> 52:09.291
Tell me it's perfect.

52:09.293 --> 52:12.194
" I believe in yesterday,
daniel my brother,

52:12.196 --> 52:15.531
Hey, now you're a rock star,
one way or another?"

52:15.533 --> 52:16.599
Isn't it great?

52:16.601 --> 52:20.369
Loretta, these are just
lines from other songs.

52:20.371 --> 52:24.406
Yeah, but <i> I</i> put them
all together.

52:24.976 --> 52:26.208
You want to hear the music?

52:26.210 --> 52:27.810
No, I know the music.

52:27.812 --> 52:31.380
Loretta, you can't just
take bits and pieces
of other songs.

52:31.382 --> 52:33.215
Why not?

52:33.216 --> 52:35.049
You made me out of
bits and pieces of
other people.

52:35.052 --> 52:36.785
Th-that's different.

52:36.787 --> 52:37.820
How?

52:37.822 --> 52:39.955
It just is. Ok, look,

52:39.957 --> 52:41.157
I know you can do
better than this.

52:41.159 --> 52:43.359
Maybe I'll write you
a new creative plug-in.

52:43.361 --> 52:47.329
No! You always
want to change me.

52:47.331 --> 52:49.231
Why am I never
good enough for you?

52:49.233 --> 52:51.567
There's always room
for improvement.

52:51.569 --> 52:54.303
You said I was perfect.

52:54.305 --> 52:56.705
Yeah. Hmph.

52:56.707 --> 53:00.042
Well, even perfection
has its limits.

53:05.349 --> 53:06.649
I want to go to the mall.

53:06.651 --> 53:09.218
Huh. You can't.

53:09.220 --> 53:10.753
The mall's closed.

53:10.755 --> 53:12.154
Not in japan.

53:12.156 --> 53:13.322
We can't go to japan.

53:13.324 --> 53:14.757
<i>You</i> can't go

53:14.759 --> 53:17.693
Because <i> you're</i> not a hologram,

53:17.695 --> 53:20.262
But I can upload
straight to tokyo.

53:20.264 --> 53:22.331
So who's limited now?

53:22.332 --> 53:24.399
Downloading from the net
is much different
than uploading.

53:24.402 --> 53:27.169
If you upload,
the net will
tear you apart.

53:27.171 --> 53:28.237
Ho would you know?

53:28.239 --> 53:30.506
You know what?

53:30.508 --> 53:32.041
I'm not gonna have
this argument.

53:32.043 --> 53:35.411
Fine. Then just
reprogram me
to not argue.

53:35.413 --> 53:37.213
Maybe I will.

53:37.215 --> 53:40.783
That's it. I'm leaving.

53:41.586 --> 53:44.253
Roscoe:
Loretta, wait!

53:44.255 --> 53:47.089
If you step out
that door, you'll
be gone forever.

53:47.091 --> 53:49.358
Is that you want?

53:55.233 --> 53:59.335
It's not fair
you made me like this.

54:00.638 --> 54:04.206
You should've made me real.

54:07.478 --> 54:10.913
Look, from now on

54:10.915 --> 54:13.315
No more tinkering
with your programs.
All right?

54:13.317 --> 54:18.220
You're already
everything I wanted
you to be.

54:20.091 --> 54:22.858
What about I want to be?

54:27.131 --> 54:30.532
Huh. Uhh.

54:52.189 --> 54:55.991
Ciao, roscoe.

55:12.777 --> 55:15.878
Driver: Hey!
No pedestrian traffic!

55:15.880 --> 55:18.881
Get you butt
out of the info pipe!

55:20.718 --> 55:22.184
Can you help me?

55:22.186 --> 55:24.787
I'm sorry. My engine's
already on a search.

55:24.789 --> 55:26.789
Please.

55:27.525 --> 55:29.992
All right, all right, get in.

55:33.230 --> 55:35.898
All right.

55:41.405 --> 55:43.672
So what are you looking for?

55:43.674 --> 55:46.909
I don't know. A way out?

55:46.911 --> 55:49.478
A way out.

55:51.215 --> 55:54.516
That's 4,335 matches.

55:54.518 --> 55:57.419
<i>No way out, way out west,</i>

55:57.421 --> 56:00.756
Way out on a limb.
Ha ha ha!

56:05.396 --> 56:08.063
Oh!

56:10.167 --> 56:11.667
Hey, are you looking
to refinance?

56:11.669 --> 56:13.869
We've got the lowest
mortgage rates!

56:13.871 --> 56:15.504
Huh, huh?
What do you say?

56:15.506 --> 56:17.272
Get lost!

56:22.213 --> 56:23.545
I hate pop-up ads.

56:23.547 --> 56:28.150
Pop! Pop! Pop!
I hate 'em,
I hate 'em.

56:29.420 --> 56:33.021
Ok, hold on.

56:41.465 --> 56:43.799
What's that over there?

56:43.801 --> 56:45.701
That? A server.

56:45.703 --> 56:48.937
Pretty big one
by the look of it.

56:50.274 --> 56:51.373
Hey, what are you doing?

56:51.375 --> 56:55.177
Hey, you don't want to go there!

57:25.810 --> 57:27.242
E-mail.

57:27.244 --> 57:31.079
I can attach myself
to an e-mail.

57:31.081 --> 57:33.982
I just need to find
the right one.

57:34.785 --> 57:38.854
Excuse me. Is this
sorted alphabetically

57:38.856 --> 57:39.988
Or by domain?

57:39.990 --> 57:41.423
Virus alert, virus alert!

57:41.425 --> 57:43.258
What?

57:45.463 --> 57:47.429
Oh!

57:55.639 --> 57:57.339
Oh.

57:59.210 --> 58:01.777
Hello?

58:01.779 --> 58:04.713
Can anyone help me?

58:04.715 --> 58:07.049
I'm lost.

58:23.033 --> 58:24.183
Name?

58:24.184 --> 58:25.334
Loretta modern.
I need to find...

58:25.336 --> 58:27.870
Do you have
an e-mail address?

58:27.872 --> 58:29.805
Yes.

58:32.676 --> 58:34.710
We cannot be held responsible

58:34.712 --> 58:36.078
For any accidental deletions,

58:36.080 --> 58:39.815
Power surges,
or data corruptions.

58:39.817 --> 58:41.216
Mm-hmm.

58:43.320 --> 58:45.821
Yeow! Aah!

58:47.691 --> 58:50.526
Computer: You have
a new message.

58:50.528 --> 58:53.161
Loretta:
Samantha, help me!

58:53.163 --> 58:55.297
What?

59:00.337 --> 59:01.570
It's me... loretta!

59:01.572 --> 59:06.174
Uhh! Roscoe e-mailed
you to me?

59:06.176 --> 59:07.176
I was only kidding.

59:07.177 --> 59:08.944
Quick, plug in my data cell.

59:08.946 --> 59:11.613
Uhh. Oh, fine.

59:11.615 --> 59:13.782
If roscoe wants to play games,

59:13.784 --> 59:17.286
I can play games, too.

59:20.357 --> 59:24.359
There you are, loretta.
Safe and sound.

59:24.361 --> 59:27.229
And you can stay there
till the next ice age

59:27.231 --> 59:29.998
For all I care.

59:49.887 --> 59:51.587
Where's samantha?

59:51.589 --> 59:56.224
She's inside. Whoa,
slow down, roscoe.

01:00:02.232 --> 01:00:03.999
Loretta's gone.

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:05.601
Gone? What do
you mean gone?

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:07.769
We had a fight.
She went into the net.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:11.273
What did you tell her?
"my way or the information
superhighway?"

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:12.741
I don't think you get it.

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:14.626
The internet's like
a tornado for her.

01:00:14.627 --> 01:00:16.510
She could be shredded
between a thousand
different servers.

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:18.080
I'm sure she can
take care of herself.

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:20.148
I was up all night
trying to trace her.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.950
What's the band
gonna do
without her?

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:24.486
It's not about the band.

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:26.421
It's about you.

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:28.090
What?

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:29.691
You're in love with her.

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:32.995
Don't be ridiculous.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:35.097
Of course you are.

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:39.368
You designed her to be
your perfect girl.

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:41.870
How could you help
but fall in love with her?

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:43.939
She can sing, she can dance,

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:47.109
She's funny and beautiful.

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:49.444
But you know what, roscoe?

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:51.613
She's not real.

01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:57.052
What is real, anyway?

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:01.189
Me. I'm real.

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:03.225
And I'm right here.

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:07.896
I've always been right here.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:17.939
Sam, I...

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:20.308
I've got her.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.310
What?

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:23.845
Loretta. She found
her way to my computer.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.981
Well, then she's ok?

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:31.386
She's fine.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.395
Oh!

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:43.565
I'll leave you two alone.

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:03.785
Thank you.

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:08.590
You, uh, remember
the last thing
susan said to you?

01:02:08.592 --> 01:02:10.358
What?

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.696
Susan.
Your last girlfriend.

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:16.465
I haven't thought
about her in ages.

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:20.268
She said, "I hope
you like eating alone."

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.270
Then she slammed the door.

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:26.742
She was very good
at slamming doors.

01:02:26.744 --> 01:02:30.545
Heh! So, uh...

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:32.748
You like eating alone?

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.750
I'm not alone.
I've got you.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:37.419
My business partner.
Heh!

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:41.189
Mom slammed doors, too?

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:42.824
What, are you writing a paper

01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:44.593
On my failed relationships?

01:02:44.595 --> 01:02:46.394
No, uh... thanks.

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:50.632
I'm just wondering
why you never got
married again.

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:55.971
I guess I was...

01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:59.341
Looking
for something that I
never quite found.

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:02.611
Perfection?

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:06.114
You know, I always
believed in
the perfect match,

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.949
That there was someone out there

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.317
Who'd be exactly what I needed

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:13.455
And we would sort of
complete each other.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:15.323
But you never found her.

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:19.427
Well, perfection's
a funny thing.

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.298
I mean, look
how perfect this is.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.868
The way the crystal
captures the light,

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:30.839
Refracts it
into beautiful patterns.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.677
Silicon's amazing, isn't it?

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:39.848
You can mold it into
glass or computer chips,

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:42.184
But you know what?

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:43.351
It's not alive.

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:46.288
And the more you try to find

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:49.691
That kind of perfection
in people,

01:03:49.693 --> 01:03:54.462
The more meals...
You will eat alone.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.073
Roscoe:
It's amazing.

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:08.443
The internet
didn't damage
your pattern at all.

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:14.883
Roscoe...

01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:17.686
What's it like to feel?

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.187
What's it like to touch?

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:23.258
I'm not really sure
it's something
you can explain.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.993
Try?

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:27.162
Ok.

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:33.001
Uh, all right.

01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:34.603
Close your eyes.

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:38.106
Now... Imagine
a dance floor.

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:41.943
You and and your
partner are dancing
to the beat.

01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:43.445
Hip-hop or rock?

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:44.279
Oh, it doesn't matter,

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:47.482
Because suddenly it changes.

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:50.285
It slows down to a ballad.

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.087
Ok.

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:54.389
He touches your hair.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.591
It feels like...

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:59.561
Like a violin gently playing.

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:01.062
You touch his cheek.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:02.597
It feels like...

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:05.867
Like a flute
holding a single
quavering note

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:06.968
High above the rest.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.738
You put your arms
around each other

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.440
And begin to dance.

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:17.212
The embrace feels like a cello

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:20.815
Harmonizing with the violin.

01:05:20.817 --> 01:05:22.817
Ok.

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:25.020
Now open your eyes.

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:33.328
There. There.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:35.764
You feel that?

01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:38.433
No.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.635
I can't feel anything.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.573
That's ok.

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:47.342
Me, neither.

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:50.345
Nothing at all.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:54.883
Guess you and I never will.

01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:04.359
 If you love me,
you sure show it strange 

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:09.764
 is there anything
that you wouldn't change? 

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:16.271
 I can't be
your paper doll 

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:19.207
 I want to be perfect 

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:20.542
 but I'm me 

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:23.311
 I want to be flawless 

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:24.646
 but you see 

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:28.550
 every little crack,
every chip, every dent 

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:33.621
 every little mistake,
oh, yeah 

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:36.458
 I want to be perfect 

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.226
 just like you 

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:40.395
 but there's only so much 

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:42.897
 that a girl can do 

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:46.835
 when I look in the mirror
what is see 

01:06:46.837 --> 01:06:51.339
 makes sense to me, yeah 

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:54.409
 perfectly 

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:02.817
Ok. There's no need
to be nervous.

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:04.336
I'm fine.

01:07:04.337 --> 01:07:05.854
I mean, just because
he's president
of the record company

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:08.590
And he's meeting, well,
right now with my boss,

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:12.527
That's no reason
to be intimidated.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:15.263
I'm not.

01:07:15.265 --> 01:07:17.399
Good.

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:19.000
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

01:07:19.002 --> 01:07:21.169
Again?
Yeah.

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:23.071
Heh!

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.344
That looks like daryl.

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:33.415
Roscoe: It is. Back when
he was rapper de fibb.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:34.783
He looks so mean.

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:36.652
Eh, it's all image.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:38.520
Ah, that was my debut album.
Went double platinum.

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:39.788
Barely made a penny, though.

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:41.589
Harshtone records
got all the money.

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:43.742
That's not right.

01:07:43.743 --> 01:07:45.894
Maybe not. But every
performer has a choice.

01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:47.629
Weldon giles
offered me a contract.

01:07:47.631 --> 01:07:49.798
It was my choice to sign it.

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:51.966
I'm glad I don't
have to worry about
things like money.

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:54.619
Or meetings.

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:57.271
Mr. Giles would prefer
that loretta wasn't
in our discussion.

01:07:57.274 --> 01:07:59.207
Giles:
You and your son

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:01.743
Have revolutionized
the music industry.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.144
You've given it new life.

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:05.413
Loretta modern's
on her way to being
a household name.

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:08.616
Skygraph's entering
into a partnership
with harshtone, xander.

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:11.286
With you spearheading
the new division.

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:13.455
Heh! I... I don't know
what to say.

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:15.957
We will corner the market
on holographic performers.

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:17.792
You don't have to
pay 'em, you don't
have to feed 'em,

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:21.229
And when
they're not on stage,
you can put 'em away.

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:22.930
That's the kind of
performer I like.

01:08:22.933 --> 01:08:25.934
How are
the holograms gonna
feel about that?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.069
Uh...

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.808
Funny kid.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:35.477
Roscoe, I'm giving
you and your father

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:38.680
Free creative rein
to develop new holographic
personalities.

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:40.915
In the meantime,
we'll exploit
the one we've got.

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:42.917
What do you mean
the one you've got?

01:08:42.919 --> 01:08:45.487
We purchased loretta
from skygraph.

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:48.156
No. They can't
just buy her.

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:51.292
Well, they purchase
computer programs
all the time.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.460
Yeah, it looks like
they bought you, too.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.362
Roscoe, I know
loretta might seem

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.430
Like an individual,
but she's not.

01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:57.265
Then what is she?

01:08:57.267 --> 01:09:00.535
Property. And now
she's my property,

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:01.301
Plain and simple.

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.337
Roscoe, let's just step outside

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.506
And talk calmly about this.

01:09:04.506 --> 01:09:05.673
Yeah, I know. Like
business partners.

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:08.042
But you know what?
I'm not your
business partner.

01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:08.943
I'm your son.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:12.147
Ahem. We have
the ability

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:14.349
To create lorettas
of every ethnicity...

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.384
Asian, african american,
hispanic.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:18.386
Giles:
It's brilliant...
No.

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:21.356
We'll mold loretta
into whatever
we want her to be.

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:24.392
Isn't that right, xander?

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.194
Xander?

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:29.564
Y-yes.

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:32.200
Yes, we can do all of that.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:36.237
But just because
we can doesn't mean
that we should.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:39.240
I'm sorry, but I'm
with my son on this.

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:43.377
Whether loretta
is a person
or a program,

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.381
She deserves
to be treated
with dignity.

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:48.383
Fine.

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:52.487
I'll set up a task force
on hologram ethics.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.423
Daryl, could you please
take the data cell?

01:09:57.327 --> 01:09:58.793
Now.

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:04.966
I'm sorry, roscoe.

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:07.268
It's not fair.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.436
I need security in here.

01:10:08.438 --> 01:10:10.338
Xander, talk
to your son.
Come on!

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:13.041
You know, for once
that's exactly what
I intend to do.

01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:15.043
How could you let him do this?

01:10:15.045 --> 01:10:17.779
You said every performer
has a choice.

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:20.949
How about loretta?
Where's her choice?

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:24.018
All right, sir, let's go.

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:29.891
I want that under lock and key.

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:32.860
We won't let them
get away with it.
You created loretta.

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:36.364
We won't let them
do this to you
or to her.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:41.402
What is it?

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.605
Nothing.

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:46.808
Hey, dad, if I were to tell you

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.409
How proud I was to be your son,

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:50.912
Would you get all mushy on me?

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:53.381
Who me? No.

01:10:53.383 --> 01:10:55.250
Good, good.

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:58.720
'cause, uh, I am proud.

01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:05.610
Dad!

01:11:05.611 --> 01:11:08.128
Xander: Whoa! I'm ok,
I'm ok! I'm done.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.969
Where am I? Roscoe?

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:17.505
You have a decision
to make, loretta.

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:21.309
Roscoe can't
make it for you,
neither can I.

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:24.279
On the one hand,
you can stay here.

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:26.247
If you do, harshtone
will own you.

01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:28.182
You'll perform
when they tell you.

01:11:28.184 --> 01:11:31.119
All I want to do is perform.

01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:34.322
Then maybe this is
where you belong.

01:11:34.324 --> 01:11:38.293
But then on the other hand.

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:39.193
Your handheld.

01:11:39.195 --> 01:11:42.297
With wireless web.

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.799
I uploaded once.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.335
The choice is yours.

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:49.504
Giles: Fibbs,
are you in there?

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:52.840
I hope you're taking
good care of my girl.

01:11:58.181 --> 01:11:59.814
Daryl, voice-over:
"dear mr. Giles,

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.482
"after careful consideration,

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.517
"I've decided to free myself

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:04.218
"from you and harshtone records.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.954
"I believe our friend
loretta modern

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:09.123
Has chosen to do the same."

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:12.894
Sincerely, daryl j. Fibbs."

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:21.235
Heh! Ha ha!

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:28.076
You again?

01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:29.877
Mm-hmm.

01:12:29.879 --> 01:12:31.579
Where to this time?

01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:34.182
Anywhere but here.

01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:37.385
4,200,708 matches.

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:39.287
Ha ha ha!

01:12:58.274 --> 01:12:59.674
Roscoe... ow!

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:01.059
Roscoe!

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.443
Do you have any idea
what he just did?

01:13:02.445 --> 01:13:03.277
You don't understand.

01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:04.512
Oh, I understand just fine.

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:06.013
He's a lying,
cheating,
self-serving,

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.282
Underhanded arrogant
ball of slime!

01:13:08.284 --> 01:13:09.717
Are you done?

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.420
No, I'm not done.

01:13:12.422 --> 01:13:14.622
Ok. Now I'm done.

01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:17.925
So am I. I resigned
from harshtone.

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:18.893
What?

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:19.860
I didn't like the air
of oppression.

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:21.429
Time I started my own
recording company.

01:13:21.431 --> 01:13:24.298
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.402
Loretta's gone, too.
She escaped into the net.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:28.736
You let her into the net?

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.388
Hey, it was either that

01:13:30.389 --> 01:13:32.039
Or let weldon giles get
his clutches into her.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.108
What about the concert?

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:37.245
Oh, there isn't
going to be a concert.

01:13:37.247 --> 01:13:40.265
The zettabytes are history.

01:13:40.266 --> 01:13:43.284
Rachel: Come on.
Could you spare us
the gloom and doom?

01:13:44.888 --> 01:13:47.388
Roscoe: Sam?

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:51.492
Guys, I have an idea.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:03.905
 People say you gotta be
fake to make it to the top 

01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:05.606
 to get on the top 

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:07.909
 you're never gonna have
what it takes 

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:10.344
 so you might
as well stop 

01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:12.013
 but we're not 

01:14:12.015 --> 01:14:13.915
 because
I know you know I know 

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:17.418
 this time
there's no pretending 

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.255
 so come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on 

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:22.807
 get real 

01:14:22.808 --> 01:14:24.358
 ooh ahh, I really
feel the feeling 

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.810
 get real 

01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:27.261
 hopefully we'll never
hit the ceiling 

01:14:27.263 --> 01:14:28.763
 get real 

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.264
 help me get answers
to the meaning 

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:32.700
 get up, get on,
get over it 

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:35.470
 get out of our way 

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:39.006
 it's time to get real 

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.703
 get real 

01:14:52.704 --> 01:14:54.387
 ooh ahh, I really
feel the feeling 

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:56.057
 get real 

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:57.725
 hopefully we'll never
hit the ceiling 

01:14:57.727 --> 01:14:59.344
 get real 

01:14:59.345 --> 01:15:00.962
 help me get answers
to the meaning 

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:03.397
 get up, get on,
get over it... 

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:27.755
Excuse me.
Let me through!

01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:33.160
Is she ok?

01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:34.962
Samantha!

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:20.241
Oh, it's just
an e-mail.

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:22.977
You don't think...

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:41.062
Ooh! That was fun!

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:42.730
Where have you been?

01:16:42.732 --> 01:16:45.266
In japan.

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:47.802
Club hopping!

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:51.339
No, don't dance.
Not here.

01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:55.476
Where is here, anyway?

01:16:58.514 --> 01:17:00.848
I don't understand.
What happened?

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:05.252
She tried to be you.
That's what happened.

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:08.489
When you didn't
show up to the concert

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:11.258
She tried to take your place.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.261
Well, someone
should be fixing her,

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:16.664
Running diagnostics.

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:19.066
She fell
and hit her head.
It's not that easy.

01:17:22.338 --> 01:17:23.838
Roscoe, you fix her.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.306
I can't.

01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:27.108
All we can do is wait.

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:28.676
Come on. We'll wait
with the others.

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:31.112
No. I want to
stay here.

01:17:31.114 --> 01:17:33.347
Loretta.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:35.449
This machine.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:38.219
What is it?
What does it do?

01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:40.855
E.E.G. It measures
brain activity.

01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:45.693
Those wires,
are they connected
to her brain?

01:17:45.695 --> 01:17:47.528
Sort of.

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:50.831
Loretta, no.
It's not a computer.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.634
If you go in there,
you can't come out.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:02.376
Loretta, no!

01:18:13.723 --> 01:18:17.458
Samantha? Where are you?

01:18:21.497 --> 01:18:23.497
Samantha?

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:26.767
Samantha?

01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:34.008
Samantha, are you all right?

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:41.282
It's broken.

01:18:42.618 --> 01:18:46.187
Your hardware needs
to be rewired.

01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:48.489
That's all.

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:58.332
There. Try it now.

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:49.784
Loretta?

01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:51.285
What are you doing here?

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:53.154
I'm here to fix you.

01:19:53.156 --> 01:19:56.323
Play something.

01:20:08.538 --> 01:20:11.305
Hmm!

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:13.341
That's so beautiful.

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:15.376
I wish I could learn
to play something
like that.

01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:16.944
Roscoe could program you.

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:18.712
It's not the same as learning.

01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:20.514
You get to make mistakes.

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:24.185
You get to see yourself
get better little
by little,

01:20:24.187 --> 01:20:29.290
So when you finally
get there it actually
means something.

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:35.229
All this time I've been
jealous of you

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:38.999
Because it all came
so easy to you.

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:43.470
Heh! Singing, dancing,
perfect personality...

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:47.308
Perfect! Ugh!
I hate that word.

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:52.112
If I'm so perfect,
why do I feel so limited?

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:59.386
I mean, look at this place
you've created.

01:21:05.328 --> 01:21:07.094
You're so lucky.

01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:13.367
Samantha, you get
to be the dreamer,

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:16.337
But all I'll ever be

01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:19.440
Is the dream.

01:21:19.675 --> 01:21:23.410
I never thought of it that way.

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.248
You're losing your pattern.

01:21:29.252 --> 01:21:31.285
So are you.

01:21:31.287 --> 01:21:33.354
It looks like there's
only enough room

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:37.291
For one of us in here.

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:43.530
She's waking up.

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:48.135
Samantha?
Samantha honey?

01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:50.938
Roscoe:
Sam, are you ok?

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:07.554
Hi, roscoe.

01:22:07.556 --> 01:22:09.623
Loretta?

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:15.462
Heh! Everything's
so different.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:18.499
Everybody feels different.

01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:21.168
I don't understand.

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:22.603
If this is loretta,

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:25.339
Where's samantha?

01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:29.643
There was only room
for one of us at a time.

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:32.680
Now it's my turn to feel.

01:22:32.682 --> 01:22:35.816
What are you saying?

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:43.090
Oh!

01:22:43.092 --> 01:22:44.692
Whoa!
Honey?

01:22:46.262 --> 01:22:47.928
My pattern's weak.

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.965
You're just not
used to the weight.

01:22:50.967 --> 01:22:55.202
What do you mean
it's your turn
to feel?

01:22:57.206 --> 01:22:59.707
It's only for a while.

01:23:05.948 --> 01:23:08.916
Look at the rain, roscoe.

01:23:20.296 --> 01:23:23.430
Am I everything
you wanted me to be?

01:23:24.367 --> 01:23:25.733
It doesn't matter.

01:23:25.735 --> 01:23:29.870
All that matters is
what you want to be.

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.240
When's samantha coming back?

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:37.511
Why would you want
samantha, anyway?

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:41.682
She's not like me.
She's not perfect.

01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:43.217
She doesn't have to be.

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:47.187
Are you saying
you love her because
of her imperfections?

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:48.689
Yes.

01:23:48.691 --> 01:23:50.691
Because of everything she is.

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:55.129
And because of
everything she's not.

01:23:56.232 --> 01:23:58.799
Yeah.

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:03.070
So... You'll let her
come back?

01:24:03.072 --> 01:24:05.672
Heh! Of course I will.

01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:09.977
What kind of hologram
do you think I am? Heh!

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:16.350
But first... The rain.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.354
You really want to do this?

01:24:20.356 --> 01:24:24.758
More than anything in the world.

01:25:31.327 --> 01:25:33.861
Unh!

01:25:33.863 --> 01:25:38.265
Samantha! Sam!

01:25:39.034 --> 01:25:41.268
Samantha.

01:25:45.007 --> 01:25:47.341
Samantha.

01:25:48.677 --> 01:25:51.345
Loretta!
Where's loretta?

01:25:51.347 --> 01:25:53.714
She's gone.
Where?

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:56.917
I don't know.

01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:12.299
 Oh, hoo-oo 

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:18.805
 I don't understand 

01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:22.910
 this should be so easy 

01:26:22.912 --> 01:26:27.181
 to just reach out
my hand 

01:26:27.183 --> 01:26:31.752
 and know the world
is real 

01:26:31.754 --> 01:26:36.390
 but nothing's
as it seems 

01:26:36.392 --> 01:26:40.727
 no, I can
tell you freely 

01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:48.729
 touching's not the only
way to feel 

01:26:49.171 --> 01:26:54.208
 when the rain falls 

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:57.678
 it's like heaven's
crying 

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:03.083
 and the name's all 

01:27:03.085 --> 01:27:07.421
 the difference
that there is 

01:27:07.423 --> 01:27:11.625
 'cause tears are 

01:27:11.627 --> 01:27:15.462
 the same
when they are trying 

01:27:15.464 --> 01:27:19.099
 to grow something good 

01:27:19.101 --> 01:27:24.471
 out of all the pain, hey 

01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:29.443
 there's no difference
between the teardrops 

01:27:29.445 --> 01:27:33.714
 and the rain 

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:39.987
 haa, hoo-oo 

01:27:41.257 --> 01:27:43.490
Whoo-oo-oo-oo!

01:27:43.492 --> 01:27:45.559
Bravo!

01:27:49.064 --> 01:27:52.466
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:03.844
Roscoe:
Hey, it was awesome.

01:28:03.846 --> 01:28:06.280
You were born to sing ballads.

01:28:06.282 --> 01:28:07.981
I was kind of flat
on the second verse.

01:28:07.983 --> 01:28:11.685
Hey, what do you want...
Perfection?

01:28:14.023 --> 01:28:17.291
You sound great
just the way you are.

01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:18.191
Heh.

01:28:18.193 --> 01:28:21.328
Well,
rachel's harmonies
helped me out.

01:28:21.330 --> 01:28:23.530
Harmony? I wasn't
singing harmony.

01:28:23.532 --> 01:28:25.365
I thought it was cindy.

01:28:25.367 --> 01:28:28.535
Hey, I don't sing.
I just play drums.

01:28:28.537 --> 01:28:32.439
Well, then who's...

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:42.282
What is it?

01:28:42.284 --> 01:28:45.752
I think the zettabytes
have a guardian angel.

01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:49.589
Come on.

01:29:07.176 --> 01:29:12.879
 You may find me
just a little strange 

01:29:12.881 --> 01:29:18.919
 I like dancing barefoot
in the pouring rain 

01:29:18.921 --> 01:29:24.558
 my mind is racing
at the speed of light 

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:31.198
 I'll dance around you
like a satellite 

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.101
 I'm reckless 

01:29:34.103 --> 01:29:35.936
 you're speechless 

01:29:35.938 --> 01:29:38.438
 scream, shout,
I love it loud 

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:42.042
 I feel the need to stand
out in the crowd 

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:47.681
 nothing's wrong with me 

01:29:47.683 --> 01:29:54.154
 nothing's wrong with me
