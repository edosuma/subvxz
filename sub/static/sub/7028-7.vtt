After only three weeks.

He doesn't waste any time.

Uh, yes. I mean, that's the
first time I've heard it,

02:52.718 --> 02:54.518

Okay, there. That's fine.

03:32.758 --> 03:35.325
- Pesos.
- Eh, don't help him.

03:35.327 --> 03:36.560
- He needs to learn.
- Whoa!

03:36.562 --> 03:37.528
Aah!

- What you doing?
- Moving in.

I won Rodrigo's dressing room
in a poker game last night.

03:44.803 --> 03:45.969
You only won because you lie.

03:45.971 --> 03:47.604
- It's called bluffing.
- It's a lie.

03:47.606 --> 03:49.573
- It's part of the game.
- It still hurts.

03:49.575 --> 03:50.874

Ooh, yeah?

03:55.547 --> 03:56.547
Ooh, no.

03:56.548 --> 03:57.581
I can play cards.

03:57.583 --> 03:58.715
You're a sweet kid, Roxie,

03:58.717 --> 04:01.184
but this game is not
for the faint of heart.

04:01.186 --> 04:04.721
Where am I supposed to
hang my cat's clothes?

04:07.259 --> 04:09.726
Oh, no. Ana, is it your birthday?

04:09.728 --> 04:11.895
I mean, of course I
know it's your birthday.

04:11.897 --> 04:13.130
You didn't get my cake?

04:13.132 --> 04:14.631
I'm calling the bakery right now.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.800
Oh, I am dialing. I am
so going to yell at them.

04:16.802 --> 04:18.435
Gael, it's not my birthday.

04:18.437 --> 04:20.937
Thank God. I was falling apart fast.

04:20.939 --> 04:25.175
"Ana, life without you would
be 'unbearable,' James."

04:25.177 --> 04:26.810
- Both: Aww.
- Ah.

04:26.812 --> 04:29.279
- Both: Ah?
- Oh, I mean, aww.

04:29.281 --> 04:31.248
- You okay?
- Yeah, you know,

04:31.250 --> 04:33.183
James is the perfect guy.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.118
He's smart and successful.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.454
It's just... it's been
getting a little intense.

04:37.456 --> 04:40.924
Flowers every day, this big bear.

04:40.926 --> 04:42.826
Last night he took me
to a Cuban restaurant.

04:42.828 --> 04:44.761
- So?
- In Cuba.

04:44.763 --> 04:46.463
So romantic.

04:46.465 --> 04:47.931
I feel like a supporting character

04:47.933 --> 04:49.399
in your romantic comedy.

04:49.401 --> 04:52.803
I'd be up in the top corner
of the poster going like this.

04:52.805 --> 04:54.771
You're lucky. My ex's
idea of being romantic

04:54.773 --> 04:56.973
was closing the door when
he went to the bathroom.

04:56.975 --> 05:00.243
Well, it is your first real
post-divorce relationship.

05:00.245 --> 05:03.046
Yeah, I know. It's just moving so fast.

05:03.048 --> 05:05.082
But I'm sure I'll catch up to him.

05:05.084 --> 05:07.484
I mean, besides, this bear is pretty cute.

05:11.323 --> 05:12.489
Sorry.

05:12.491 --> 05:15.158
Suit gets really hot,
so sometimes I pass out.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.727
Which one of you is Ana?

05:21.567 --> 05:23.767
You know, it's weird. I've
been all over the world

05:23.769 --> 05:25.802
and I've only ever seen
it through hotel windows

05:25.804 --> 05:27.104
and conference rooms.

05:27.106 --> 05:28.805
That's right, man. Let it out.

05:28.807 --> 05:32.809
But there is one thing that
is really going right for me.

05:32.811 --> 05:35.712
Ana. She is amazing.

05:35.714 --> 05:37.447
I have never met anyone so fun.

05:37.449 --> 05:39.483
Does she still sleep with those mittens on?

05:39.485 --> 05:40.717
Yeah, so she doesn't scratch her face

05:40.719 --> 05:42.486
during her night terrors. Yes.

05:42.488 --> 05:44.688
I mean, what is that
girl running from, man?

05:46.125 --> 05:47.724
Is it strange that I'm
talking about this stuff

05:47.726 --> 05:49.159
with her ex-husband?

05:49.161 --> 05:51.261
You're not talking to the ex-husband here.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.663
You're talking to the piano man.

05:53.665 --> 05:55.365
James. What are you doing here?

05:55.367 --> 05:57.134
Hey. I just came to give you...

05:57.136 --> 05:58.268
Not another talking bear.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.003
A kiss. I came to give you a kiss.

06:00.005 --> 06:02.205
Oh, okay. Just a kiss.

06:02.207 --> 06:05.075
Well, in that case, I
am gonna kiss you first.

06:05.077 --> 06:06.510
Well, my kiss is gonna kiss your kiss.

06:06.512 --> 06:08.778
Aah! Okay, thank you.

06:08.780 --> 06:09.780
Oh, look at that.

06:09.781 --> 06:10.781
My kiss is having little baby kisses.

06:10.782 --> 06:11.749
Now I'm kissing all over your face.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.884
Oh, this is almost too many kisses.

06:13.886 --> 06:15.652
Oh, oh, oh. I gotta take this.

06:15.654 --> 06:17.220
I'm gonna see you tonight though, yeah?

06:17.222 --> 06:19.356
- Yeah.
- I love you.

06:19.358 --> 06:21.024
No, Mark, I'm talking to my girlfriend.

06:21.026 --> 06:24.761
This guy. I like you a lot too though.

06:24.763 --> 06:27.764
Wha... did James just say he loves me?

06:27.766 --> 06:29.799
'Cause if he did, that's
not moving slow at all.

06:29.801 --> 06:31.168
That's moving very, very fast.

06:31.170 --> 06:33.503
Maybe he just meant love
you like in a cool way.

06:33.505 --> 06:35.605
You know, like, "Love ya."

06:35.607 --> 06:37.774
Look, if James loves me, we have a problem

06:37.776 --> 06:39.943
'cause I don't love him yet.

06:39.945 --> 06:41.845
I haven't even let him
see me without makeup on!

06:41.847 --> 06:43.113
I've never seen you without makeup.

06:43.115 --> 06:44.215
Okay, this is not the point.

06:44.216 --> 06:45.282
Don't freak out.

06:45.284 --> 06:46.750
We don't know what he meant by that.

06:46.752 --> 06:50.387
Hey, um, I just said I loved
you and that was weird, right?

06:50.389 --> 06:52.122
Yes. Yes, thank you.

06:52.124 --> 06:53.290
So weird.

06:53.292 --> 06:54.524
- Look, it just slipped out.
- Okay.

06:54.526 --> 06:56.660
But I wanted you to
know what I meant by it.

06:56.662 --> 06:59.596
I love you, Ana Sofia Calderon.

06:59.598 --> 07:01.565
I really love you.

07:01.567 --> 07:05.468
Muah.

07:05.470 --> 07:07.671
Well, that was very clear.

07:07.673 --> 07:09.906
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have
to break up with James.

07:12.377 --> 07:13.777
Really, Xavi?

07:17.466 --> 07:21.803
- I mean, the longer you put off bre...
- I know, I know.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.664
She's breaking up with our boss?

07:23.825 --> 07:25.382
Are you sure that's for us?

07:25.523 --> 07:27.771
I meant you. I said you.

07:27.814 --> 07:28.979
He's got a point.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.714
Whatever you do, just do it nicely.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.783
If he gets upset, he can cancel our show.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.319
Next thing you know, we're
sweeping floors for a living.

07:38.357 --> 07:39.723
He didn't mean it like that.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.792
You're a very important part of the show.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.595
You know what? Let me finish up for you.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.096
Guys, what do I do?

07:46.098 --> 07:47.631
What's the best way to
break up with someone

07:47.633 --> 07:49.233
without hurting their feelings?

07:49.235 --> 07:50.734
Well, when my time with a partner is over,

07:50.736 --> 07:52.303
I take her to my cabin on the beach.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.039
After a few days of crying,
journaling, and orgasms,

07:55.041 --> 07:56.707
we write our farewells,
put them in a bottle,

07:56.709 --> 07:59.176
- and send them out to sea.
- Ah. Or?

07:59.178 --> 08:00.644
You know what you shouldn't do?

08:00.646 --> 08:01.879
You shouldn't take all their stuff,

08:01.881 --> 08:03.914
dump it in the front
yard, and set it on fire.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.749
Hey. I was doing you a favor.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.585
Back then, your wardrobe was 90% fringe.

08:07.587 --> 08:08.886
Lift your feet, please.

08:08.888 --> 08:11.222
Okay, I'm going to say something crazy.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.857
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

08:12.859 --> 08:15.259
That you're not ready for
this kind of a relationship.

08:15.261 --> 08:18.495
The truth? But that's hard.

08:18.497 --> 08:19.930
James deserves the truth.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.232
Ever since his parents got divorced

08:21.234 --> 08:22.600
he's had trouble trusting.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.635
How do you know that?
And why don't I know that?

08:24.637 --> 08:26.871
I'm the piano man. People tell me things.

08:28.107 --> 08:31.542
Have you ever had a threesome
that got out of hand?

08:31.544 --> 08:34.044
Hey, you guys want to know whith

08:34.046 --> 08:37.881
- is always late to work?
- Why?

08:37.884 --> 08:40.279
- He drives his kids to school.
- Mm.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.813
What? I didn't say they
were all interesting.

08:44.985 --> 08:47.186
Okay, you can do this, Ana.

08:47.188 --> 08:50.389
Just be honest. Just
tell him your feelings.

08:50.391 --> 08:52.057
He'll totally understand.

08:52.059 --> 08:54.593
- Aah! Don't kill me!
- Wait, I'm not gonna kill you.

08:54.595 --> 08:57.296
- Unless it's with kisses.
- Oh.

08:57.298 --> 09:00.098
- Hey, babe.
- Hey... dude.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.634
Uh, I really need to talk
to you about something.

09:02.636 --> 09:05.337
I've been thinking about our relationship.

09:05.339 --> 09:06.838
- Yeah?
- And, well,

09:06.840 --> 09:11.176
I've been uncomfortable for
a while, you know, because...

09:11.178 --> 09:13.912
Because I'm your boss. I knew it.

09:13.914 --> 09:16.949
Yeah. Yes. That.

09:16.951 --> 09:18.116
You are my boss.

09:18.118 --> 09:21.553
And it's awkward for everyone at work.

09:21.555 --> 09:23.388
Our relationship has raised a few eyebrows

09:23.390 --> 09:24.923
- over at corporate.
- Mm.

09:24.925 --> 09:25.925
Which is hard to do

09:25.926 --> 09:27.993
considering we have in-house Botox.

09:27.995 --> 09:29.428
Oh, that's not good.

09:29.430 --> 09:30.929
I mean, I'm not the relationship police,

09:30.931 --> 09:35.033
but you're under arrest.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.402
You know, I was just...
I was trying to ignore

09:37.404 --> 09:39.171
the whole work thing so
that we could be together,

09:39.173 --> 09:41.573
but I don't think we can
keep going on like this.

09:41.575 --> 09:43.875
Me neither.

09:43.877 --> 09:46.178
I'm sorry.

09:46.180 --> 09:48.580
Me too.

Hey, we're gonna be okay.

10:06.166 --> 10:09.268
Yeah. I'm sure we will.

10:09.270 --> 10:10.602

10:32.726 --> 10:34.559
Oh, I'm sorry. Was I in the shot?

10:34.561 --> 10:36.361
- Cut!
- James?

10:36.363 --> 10:37.829
I... I'm so sorry to interrupt,

10:37.831 --> 10:39.598
but I have some fantastic news.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.899
I just quit my job.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.768
So now we can be together all the time.

10:43.771 --> 10:45.170
Aah!

10:49.542 --> 10:51.243
Oh, this is gonna be amazing.

10:51.245 --> 10:52.778
- Oh, oh, James, I need...
- Oh, yeah, here.

10:52.780 --> 10:54.780
- One, two, three.
- Okay.

10:54.782 --> 10:58.250
Um, wait, uh, you quit your job for me?

10:58.252 --> 10:59.785
That's so romantic.

10:59.787 --> 11:02.621
Do you have a gay brother?
Father? A gay anything?

11:02.623 --> 11:05.257
Aunt.

11:05.259 --> 11:06.858
So I am no longer the network president.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.160
I feel so good!

11:08.162 --> 11:10.829
This is crazy. You love your job.

11:10.831 --> 11:12.197
But it was taking up all of my time.

11:12.199 --> 11:13.165
I wasn't living life.

11:13.167 --> 11:15.967
Now I can be all in in our relationship.

11:15.969 --> 11:17.936
Oh, you... you weren't already all in?

11:17.938 --> 11:19.371
'Cause you seemed pretty all in.

11:19.373 --> 11:20.906
Hardly.

11:20.908 --> 11:23.508
I can't wait to spend every free moment

11:23.510 --> 11:24.843
getting lost in your eyes.

11:24.845 --> 11:26.445
Oh.

11:26.447 --> 11:27.646
James?

11:27.648 --> 11:29.347
Wait, what... what just... oh, my God.

11:29.349 --> 11:30.315
I just did it again.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.919
Muah.

11:37.057 --> 11:38.523
I thought you broke up with him.

11:38.525 --> 11:40.058
I thought I did too.

11:40.060 --> 11:42.961
I mean, I may not have been
100% honest about it all.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.362
Well, be honest now.

11:44.364 --> 11:47.199
Are you kidding? He
just quit his job for me.

11:47.201 --> 11:49.167
Now I have to see this thing through.

11:49.169 --> 11:52.471
Oh, God! We're gonna be married together.

11:56.110 --> 11:57.909
So we all agree, no lying tonight?

11:57.911 --> 11:58.878
Yes.

11:58.879 --> 12:00.078
You lying right now?

12:00.080 --> 12:02.114
Yes.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.850
- Is this my seat?
- Oh.

12:04.852 --> 12:07.853
I thought we agreed you weren't gonna play.

12:10.958 --> 12:13.458
All right. Well, I gotta warn you.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.494
We're playing Texas
no-limit, one-eyed jacks wild.

12:15.496 --> 12:17.963
So, suicide kings, no
river don't play, I'll deal.

12:17.965 --> 12:18.997
Buy-in is 20/40.

12:18.999 --> 12:22.033
Don't get caught crossing Fourth Street.

12:23.804 --> 12:27.539
Aah! YouTube shuffling
videos are very unreliable.

12:27.541 --> 12:30.142
No! Don't kill me!

12:30.144 --> 12:33.411
- What the hell?
- No, no, get back!

12:36.083 --> 12:38.116
Aah!

12:38.118 --> 12:41.052
What? James? What's going on?

12:41.054 --> 12:42.254
I thought you were being murdered.

12:42.256 --> 12:43.688
I was gonna save you.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.090
With your stain remover?

12:45.092 --> 12:48.126
Oh. It was either this or my mace.

12:48.128 --> 12:50.228
Why didn't I grab my mace?

12:50.230 --> 12:51.997
Ja... what's going on?

12:51.999 --> 12:54.065
Well, I woke up this morning
and for the first time,

12:54.067 --> 12:56.234
my whole day wasn't planned
right down to the second,

12:56.236 --> 12:58.303
so I got up, I took a shower,

12:58.305 --> 13:00.872
I went for a jog, I took a shower,

13:00.874 --> 13:02.374
I made a frittata, I read the paper,

13:02.376 --> 13:03.909
and then it was 6:00 a.m.
and I had nothing to do,

13:03.911 --> 13:05.777
so I figured I'd, you know,
come here and wait for you.

13:05.779 --> 13:07.979
- That was 12
hours ago. - Uh-huh.

13:07.981 --> 13:09.681
Did you know that you can get everything

13:09.683 --> 13:11.550
that you need now online
and they'll deliver it in,

13:11.552 --> 13:14.886
like, an hour. Pizza,
beer, a TV, video games.

13:14.888 --> 13:16.121
- Rodney and I were talking...
- Who's Rodney?

13:16.123 --> 13:17.522
'Sup?

13:17.524 --> 13:18.690
Rodney, the pizza delivery guy.

13:18.692 --> 13:20.425
So we were talking and I realized

13:20.427 --> 13:21.626
I never learned how to chill.

13:21.628 --> 13:23.962
But Rod-Rod here, he
is the king of chilling.

13:23.964 --> 13:25.564
He recommended these amazing breadsticks.

13:25.566 --> 13:27.532
- You should try one.
- Look, James,

13:27.534 --> 13:29.734
- this is all just...
- Try, try, try.

13:29.736 --> 13:31.536
- Okay, thank you. Uh-huh.
- Okay.

13:31.538 --> 13:35.507
Mm. What a... these are amazing.

13:35.509 --> 13:36.808
Right?

13:36.810 --> 13:38.777
What I was saying is, I'm not comfortable

13:38.779 --> 13:40.145
with all these changes.

13:40.147 --> 13:42.480
I know you probably think
quitting my job was crazy.

13:42.482 --> 13:45.283
Yes. A little.

13:45.285 --> 13:48.253
It's just, you can't spend
your entire days waiting for me.

13:48.255 --> 13:50.088
You need a "you" plan.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.057
There has to be more to your future

13:51.058 --> 13:52.123
than playdates with Rodney.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.758
- Huh?
- Look, I've actually been

13:53.760 --> 13:55.393
thinking a lot about the future,

13:55.395 --> 13:57.362
and I promise you I have a plan.

13:57.364 --> 13:59.331
Good.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.499
Oh, my God! There's cheese in here!

14:01.501 --> 14:02.901
I know.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.673
Just fold, Rodrigo. I know you got nothing.

14:08.675 --> 14:10.275
What? I have a great hand.

14:10.277 --> 14:12.010
You have a queen and a four.

14:12.012 --> 14:13.012
How'd you know that?

14:13.013 --> 14:14.379
'Cause you mouthed "queen"

14:14.381 --> 14:16.948
and then counted to four with your fingers.

14:16.950 --> 14:18.016
Fold.

14:18.018 --> 14:19.985
Don't get cocky.

14:19.987 --> 14:22.420
There's lots of money in that pot.

14:22.422 --> 14:24.990
You know what they say about money.

14:24.992 --> 14:28.760
It's very useful when
you need to buy things.

14:28.762 --> 14:30.829
You're in over your head.

14:30.831 --> 14:34.132
You're going down.

14:35.535 --> 14:37.002
What's happening? Are you okay?

14:37.004 --> 14:39.304
I just wanted you guys
to take me seriously.

14:39.306 --> 14:42.007
You were right. I can't handle this game.

14:42.009 --> 14:44.109
No, no, it's okay. How about this?

14:44.111 --> 14:45.911
I'm going to fold. Just please stop crying.

14:45.913 --> 14:48.413
I fold.

14:48.415 --> 14:51.650
You just got played, player.

14:53.153 --> 14:56.187
Come on. That's not all you guys bet.

14:57.791 --> 14:59.391

14:59.393 --> 15:02.727
No, I'm just gonna stay
here and wash my hair pieces.

15:07.901 --> 15:10.669
Okay, I'm hearing, like, zero words.

15:10.671 --> 15:12.737
I told you you needed to talk to him.

15:12.739 --> 15:14.906
I did. I talked to him last night.

15:14.908 --> 15:17.108
And I told him we couldn't go on like this,

15:17.110 --> 15:19.477
and he said he had a plan for the future.

15:19.479 --> 15:20.812
Okay, what's the plan?

15:20.814 --> 15:23.048

18:50.706 --> 18:52.572
James, I just... oh, God.

18:52.574 --> 18:55.642
This dress is so uncomfortable.

18:57.913 --> 18:59.980
Oh, there was also a dance number.

18:59.982 --> 19:02.449
A whole lot of this.

19:02.451 --> 19:04.284
Um, look, James,

19:04.286 --> 19:07.020
I really thought you were gonna propose.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.888
Why did you ask for my ring size?

19:08.890 --> 19:11.124
I was getting you custom-made gloves.

19:11.126 --> 19:12.292
I mean, what was I supposed to do?

19:12.294 --> 19:13.760
Just buy 'em right off the shelf?

19:13.762 --> 19:14.894
Hands are like snowflakes.

19:14.896 --> 19:16.863
I'm so sorry.

19:16.865 --> 19:19.165
That's why I sang that song for you.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.633
I wanted to give you that gift.

19:21.937 --> 19:23.770
Was that a gift?

19:23.772 --> 19:25.705
I should have been honest
with you from the start.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.208
Aw, look, I know I come on strong, okay?

19:28.210 --> 19:29.809
I'm just an all in kinda guy.

19:29.811 --> 19:32.512
I'm all in on love. I'm all in on work.

19:32.514 --> 19:34.280
I'm all in on "Law and Order,"
I'll tell you that much.

19:34.282 --> 19:35.615
Man, I have seen every single episode,

19:35.617 --> 19:36.950
including all the spinoffs.

19:36.952 --> 19:38.785
That's like a thousand hours of television.

19:38.787 --> 19:39.819
Oh, my good God.

19:39.821 --> 19:41.821
Maybe I do go a little overboard.

19:41.823 --> 19:43.356
Well, maybe it's time for you to slow down

19:43.358 --> 19:45.191
and figure out what you want.

19:45.193 --> 19:46.926
Yes. Bingo.

19:46.928 --> 19:49.062
Yes, you are right.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.430
I need to eat, pray, love on this.

19:50.432 --> 19:52.432
I need to travel, take some classes, read.

19:52.434 --> 19:54.667
Oh, my gosh. I am gonna slow down so hard.

19:54.669 --> 19:56.636
I am going to crush slowing down.

19:56.638 --> 19:58.271
- Hey, James.
- I'm doing it again, am I not?

19:58.273 --> 20:00.140
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:00.142 --> 20:03.476
Okay, look, maybe when I get back

20:03.478 --> 20:05.011
we'll both be ready to try this again.

20:05.013 --> 20:07.680
- I'd like that.
- Me too.

20:07.682 --> 20:09.949
Ana Sofia Calderon.

20:09.951 --> 20:12.652
- Thanks, Jaime.
- It's Jimmy-jam.

20:18.660 --> 20:21.294
Hugo, we're home.

20:21.296 --> 20:23.830
Oh, my God. James, where are you?

20:23.832 --> 20:25.999
- Tibet.
- Oh, looks like Wisconsin.

20:26.001 --> 20:28.868
Well, they call Tibet
the Wisconsin of the east.

20:28.870 --> 20:31.271
But this trip is amazing.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.506
I'm really having some me time, you know?

20:33.508 --> 20:37.110
I peed "James" into the snow
on four different mountain tops.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.612
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
You're really doing it.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.281
Oh...

20:41.283 --> 20:43.283
James? Well.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.617
Hey. How'd it go?

20:44.619 --> 20:46.853
Good. He seems to be in a good place.

20:46.855 --> 20:47.954
You were right.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.656
Being honest was the way to go.

20:49.658 --> 20:50.890
And in the end, no one got hurt.

20:50.892 --> 20:53.660
Mm. Want to go get some froyo?

20:53.662 --> 20:55.662
You know what? James has inspired me.

20:55.664 --> 20:57.464
Let's be crazy and get some ice cream.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.065
I mean, no one lives forever.

20:59.067 --> 21:00.333
Right.

21:00.335 --> 21:02.602
Ana?

21:02.604 --> 21:05.438
Ana?

21:05.440 --> 21:06.806
Whoa!

21:06.808 --> 21:10.110
Oh, no!
