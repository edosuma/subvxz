00:07.799 --> 00:11.261
Most people care about the truth.

00:19.185 --> 00:22.313
MAN: Kate the Great, ladies and gentlemen.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.316
BENEDICT: But most people,

00:26.401 --> 00:30.989
given proper persuasion,
can be diverted from it.

00:35.910 --> 00:41.666
Fortunately, there are some who possess
an unusually powerful love of the truth.

00:41.750 --> 00:48.590
What is the second-least
populous Asian capital?

00:51.885 --> 00:54.095
Thimphu, Bhutan.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.681
-QUESTIONER: Correct!
-

00:56.765 --> 00:59.059
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Over here! Over here for a photo, please.

01:05.148 --> 01:08.860
BENEDICT: These are the people I must find
before it's too late.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.738
Congratulations, Mr. Washington.

01:17.368 --> 01:22.332
BENEDICT: They may be humble
or obstinate, delightful or...

01:22.957 --> 01:24.626
mildly enraging...

01:24.834 --> 01:26.461
I'm told that it was a, quote,

01:26.544 --> 01:30.006
rude look from her new roommate
that set Miss Contraire off.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.801
Ms. Contraire! Mizz!

01:34.094 --> 01:35.762
You gave her a roommate?

01:40.475 --> 01:43.561
BENEDICT: These unique individuals
are the only ones

01:43.645 --> 01:48.358
who can save us from this condition
called The Emergency...

01:52.070 --> 01:54.989
where, every day,
our minds are under attack

01:55.073 --> 01:57.534
by a plague of fear and anxiety.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.285
-

02:08.044 --> 02:12.882
These truth-loving people
come from unexpected places.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.311
And in my experience,

02:26.896 --> 02:30.900
they tend to be... children.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.680
Oh, are we too loud for you, Muldoon?

03:43.348 --> 03:45.642
No, not at all, Karl.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.101
I can read under any conditions.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.979
Yeah? How's the book?

03:50.855 --> 03:52.065
It's enjoyable.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.401
-Enjoyable? He said enjoyable!
-

03:56.486 --> 03:59.405
"Enjoyable" isn't even
that complicated a word.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.284
Why are you so weird?

04:05.828 --> 04:07.330
I do not know.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.916
-KID 1: Yeah!
-KID 2: Come on!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.127
KID 3: Yeah.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.847
Why don't we start your Tamil lessons
early today, Reynie?

04:25.598 --> 04:26.808
Sure, Ms. Perumal.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.812
Aren't you hungry? I don't blame you.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.772
Is that... cheese?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.400
I think so.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.278
I can share.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.614
Thanks. It's not really the food.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.409
I'm just feeling
a little anxious, I guess.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.870
-I've been waking up like that lately.
-Me too.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.165
It just feels like something bad
is about to happen, every morning.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.209
That's The Emergency.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.379
Like it's all falling apart,
and no one can help.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.965
Everyone's just scared all the time.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.175
Everyone's preparing for the worst.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.263
And this doesn't help, does it?

05:06.764 --> 05:08.099
It's all people are talking about.

05:08.182 --> 05:11.019
-Except the water polo scores.
-

05:11.102 --> 05:13.688
Yes, at least we have
the water polo scores.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.941
Was it always like this?

05:18.109 --> 05:20.069
Bad news all the time?

05:21.279 --> 05:22.989
I don't remember it that way.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.666
Listen. I've been saving
something for you.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.005
It's a test.

05:40.256 --> 05:43.593
And the winners get a scholarship
to the Boatwright Academy.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.347
-What? The Boatwright Academy?
-The one and only.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.767
-It's a palace of learning, Reynie.
-I know.

05:50.850 --> 05:54.479
Kids go there and they come out artists
and scientists and diplomats.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.317
Not kids like me.

05:59.817 --> 06:00.985
Reynie.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.489
There's no way I'll make it.
I'm not special.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.760
You deserve to be
at a good school, Reynie.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.930
And you deserve to be around kids
who accept you.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.107
Don't let this place convince you
that you don't deserve a chance.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.445
Will you try?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.574
You really think I could do it?

06:50.701 --> 06:51.536
I do.

07:15.852 --> 07:19.063
I didn't want to, you know,
turn on the lights and wake anybody up.

07:19.689 --> 07:20.690
That makes sense.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.402
-Ready?
-Uh-huh.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.330
...among forecasters that the bottom
is falling out,

07:36.414 --> 07:39.709
and that massive job losses
and home foreclosures are inevitable.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.003
As The Emergency continues unabated,

07:42.086 --> 07:45.047
the public must prepare
for even more financial disruption

07:45.131 --> 07:46.591
and chaos in the months ahead,

07:46.674 --> 07:49.469
as the specter
of total financial collapse...

07:56.851 --> 07:59.103
WOMAN 1: Sweetheart, you got this, okay...

07:59.187 --> 08:03.774
Oslo, Paris, Tokyo, Washington... England?

08:03.858 --> 08:06.277
WOMAN 2: The economy, the pollution index.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.113
-It's like no one's--
-It's like no one's at the wheel!

08:09.822 --> 08:12.116
Don't be nervous. You'll be fine.

08:12.575 --> 08:18.915
Just remember, this is your chance.
Our chance. It's up to you.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.920
Okay... we're all set.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.339
So, call me when it's over, okay?

08:26.714 --> 08:27.798
Okay.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.969
Imagine you won't be needing
my services after this.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.679
I haven't passed it yet.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.224
-I don't even know if I want--
-Reynie.

08:36.641 --> 08:37.934
Maybe we should just skip it.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.019
We can go back and have our normal day.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.021
I really don't need all this.

08:43.439 --> 08:44.649
Reynie.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.152
It's okay to want something for yourself.

08:53.824 --> 08:57.286
Now you go in there, and you just be you.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.205
Okay?

09:00.206 --> 09:01.999
That's gonna make all the difference.

09:05.836 --> 09:08.005
This feels like a goodbye-goodbye.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.062
Good luck, sweetheart.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.879
You will have one hour.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.424
You may begin.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.222
BENEDICT: Given the speed
of the two trains

09:58.306 --> 09:59.724
and the distance between them,

09:59.807 --> 10:02.768
how long will it take
for the two trains to collide?

10:06.230 --> 10:08.357
REYNIE:
Thirty-seven minutes, four seconds.

10:09.984 --> 10:13.946
But given the standardization
of railroad timekeeping

10:14.030 --> 10:17.241
and the modernization
of both warning and braking systems,

10:17.325 --> 10:20.995
hopefully, enough safeguards
are in place to avoid a crash altogether.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.791
BENEDICT: An elephant and a llama
are falling to their deaths

10:25.875 --> 10:26.917
from a great height.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.754
You can only save one. Which?

10:29.837 --> 10:31.213
REYNIE: I'd save the elephant,

10:31.756 --> 10:33.633
in hopes that it could break
the llama's fall.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.635
BENEDICT: True or false?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.721
I'm usually right.
Most of my friends are imaginary.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.098
I don't generally feel empty inside.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.392
Real change is impossible.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.811
-Fish are unnerving.
-REYNIE: True.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.648
BENEDICT: Do you watch television?

10:49.273 --> 10:50.358
REYNIE: Not really.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.109
BENEDICT: Are you brave?

11:00.159 --> 11:03.954
Are you brave?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.295
REYNIE: I would like to think so.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.385
Pencils!

11:31.816 --> 11:36.278
I shall now read the names of the children
admitted to the second phase of the test.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.405
If your name is called,

11:37.488 --> 11:41.575
report to the Monk Building
on Third Street no later than one o'clock.

11:41.659 --> 11:45.663
You will bring one and only one pencil
as well as an eraser.

11:45.746 --> 11:49.750
Any more or less will be disqualified,
which would be a gift,

11:49.834 --> 11:53.254
considering the academic brutality
of the next exam.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.258
Yes?

11:58.050 --> 12:01.595
You say to bring only one pencil,
but what if the lead breaks?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.514
-Will there be a sharpener?
-Yes.

12:03.597 --> 12:06.809
If a sharpener should become necessary,
one will be provided.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.229
I shall now read the list.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.068
"Reynard Muldoon."

12:19.321 --> 12:22.032
-Wait, what?
-That's it?

12:22.533 --> 12:23.576
That's it?

12:28.706 --> 12:31.000
KID 4: My mom's gonna be so mad!

12:52.855 --> 12:53.939
I'll need to be a magician

12:54.023 --> 12:55.065
-to pass this test.
-No way.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.401
I hear it's way more intense.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.863
RHONDA: Oh, no!

13:03.491 --> 13:05.534
ANNOUNCER:
Test commencing in four minutes.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.328
-Report to sign-in immediately.
-I got to go.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.246
RHONDA: Oh, my God.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.043
RHONDA: Oh.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.669
That's rotten luck.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.799
You don't happen to have
an extra one, do you?

13:20.424 --> 13:23.093
No. Sorry, I was told to, you know...

13:23.177 --> 13:25.805
I know. I know. Only one pencil.

13:25.888 --> 13:29.141
And my only one is down there.
How could I have been so stupid?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.518
Boatwright was my dream.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.561
-Test commencing in three minutes.
-It was just an accident.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.522
-This is the final announcement.
-What are you still doing here?

13:34.605 --> 13:35.898
They're about to start the test.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.566
Well, I'm not gonna leave you
without a pencil.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.360
Oh, how are we going to get it back?

13:39.443 --> 13:42.154
If we're one minute late, we're out.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.741
We don't need to get it back.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.743
We can share this one.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.955
I mean, they assured me
there'd be a sharpener inside.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.671
I'm Rhonda Kazembe. It's nice to meet you.

13:58.754 --> 13:59.672
Reynie Muldoon.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.882
-If you have your eraser, we're all set.
-Mm-mm.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.009
-Let's go.
-I haven't properly thanked you.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.929
You're welcome. Come on.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.682
Here's the thing.
I'm gonna make a perfect score.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.602
-I hope you do.
-No, you don't get it.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.937
I have the answers.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.481
That's a great attitude.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.317
No, look. Sit right behind me.

14:20.401 --> 14:24.822
I will move my paper where you can see it,
so you can copy right off of it.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.116
Why would...

14:29.285 --> 14:31.453
Oh... oh.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.746
No, no, no, I...

14:32.830 --> 14:34.874
No, thank you. I'd rather not.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.961
Okay, suit yourself.
Hope you know what you're in for.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.549
I hope so, too.

14:43.632 --> 14:44.675
RHONDA: Wait, wait, wait!

15:09.366 --> 15:13.078
And if any child is caught cheating,
they will be executed.

15:16.040 --> 15:20.336
Excused. Will be excused.

15:20.419 --> 15:24.048
This test is going to be long,
and it's going to be difficult.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.093
Was I not clear about the talking?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.221
Oh, I... I just groaned.

15:32.222 --> 15:35.392
Now you've spoken again. You are excused.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.019
-Mmm.

15:50.157 --> 15:50.991
Yes?

15:55.412 --> 15:56.497
Very well.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.503
You will have one hour
to complete the test.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.756
And you must follow
these four directions exactly.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.758
One, put your name on the test.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.970
Two, read all the questions
and answers carefully.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.765
Three, circle the correct answer.
Four, bring the test to me.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.145
In order to pass, you must answer
every question correctly.

17:01.645 --> 17:02.855
Anything less...

17:04.565 --> 17:05.941
you fail.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.277
Five, start the test.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.823
4A. That was 4A.

17:18.912 --> 17:22.249
If you feel faint,
put your head between your knees.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.002
If you're going to vomit,
a trash can will be provided.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.378
Oh, God. I can't do this.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.850
BENEDICT: In 1885,
the Kingdom of Serbia declared war

17:39.933 --> 17:41.143
on the Principality of Bulgaria

17:41.226 --> 17:44.229
after Bulgaria declared unification
in the city of Plovdiv

17:44.313 --> 17:45.981
with which semi-autonomous region?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.984
A, Western Romania,
B, Eastern Rumelia, C...

17:49.485 --> 17:51.987
Where did the common vetch originate,
and to what family does it belong?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.782
Which three of the following fifty herbs
can be used in a poultice

17:54.865 --> 17:56.575
for the bite of a jumping spider?

18:00.370 --> 18:02.623
REYNIE: One, put your name on the test.

18:03.457 --> 18:06.043
Two, read all of the questions...

18:15.719 --> 18:16.970
NUMBER TWO: Thank you.

18:24.019 --> 18:28.273
REYNIE: Two, read all of the questions
and answers carefully.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.083
Fifteen minutes left!

18:50.003 --> 18:53.090
BENEDICT: The Bregovo Dispute served
as pretext for a war to break out

18:53.173 --> 18:54.800
between Bulgaria and which country

18:54.883 --> 18:58.011
when Bulgaria and the semi-autonomous
region of Eastern Rumelia

18:58.095 --> 19:01.765
declared their unification
in the city of Plovdiv in 1885?

19:03.559 --> 19:06.770
...after Bulgaria declared unification
in the city of Plovdiv

19:06.854 --> 19:08.647
with which semi-autonomous region?
Which country...

19:08.730 --> 19:11.650
...when Bulgaria and the semi-autonomous
region of Eastern Rumelia...

19:11.733 --> 19:15.070
REYNIE: Eastern Rumelia?
The answers are in the questions.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.864
BENEDICT:
Despite having originated in Europe,

19:16.947 --> 19:19.908
the vine known as the common vetch,
a member of the pea family...

19:19.992 --> 19:22.828
Where did the common vetch originate
and to what family does it belong?

19:22.911 --> 19:26.248
Which three of the following fifty herbs
can be used in a poultice for the bite...

19:26.331 --> 19:30.794
A poultice of fresh plantain leaf,
slippery elm, or yarrow will neutralize...

19:41.263 --> 19:44.600
Time! Please pass up your tests.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.603
Remain seated until they are graded.
This won't take long.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.620
You're an odd egg, Reynard.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.165
I don't know what that means.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.125
It's a compliment.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.049
I shall now read the list
of those who have passed the test.

20:17.132 --> 20:21.136
If your name is called, remain seated
and await further instruction.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.892
"Reynard Muldoon."

20:29.937 --> 20:32.231
That is all. Good day.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.332
Best of luck, kid.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.661
We've finally gotten rid
of the other children.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.956
Consolation donuts and hugs and whatnot.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.332
Only a few more minutes to wait.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.085
Would it be possible
to get a consolation donut?

21:35.168 --> 21:36.586
I'm really hungry.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.629
Are you desolate?

21:38.297 --> 21:39.339
No.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.882
-Feel like a failure?
-No, ma'am.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.259
Well, then.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.176
Wait, Miss...

21:43.677 --> 21:45.637
I'm sorry, you never really
told me your name.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.390
Nothing to be sorry for.
Do you have a question or a comment?

21:48.974 --> 21:51.393
I was just wondering
if I could please contact my tutor,

21:51.476 --> 21:53.312
Ms. Perumal, so she doesn't worry?

21:54.938 --> 21:57.107
That's a perfectly reasonable question.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.622
Is this where we're supposed to wait?

22:13.332 --> 22:16.293
It's where I'm supposed to wait,
so I guess that might go for you, too.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.004
-I'm Reynie.
-Sticky Washington.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.840
-Are you here for the test?
-Yes.

22:21.923 --> 22:24.217
I guess this means
we're going to Boatwright.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.095
So, are you the only one
who passed in your group?

22:27.179 --> 22:31.058
-I think so, which was weird because...
-Because there was a girl who cheated?

22:32.225 --> 22:34.144
-How did you know?
-The same thing happened to me.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.022
Rhonda, right?
Did she lose her pencil outside?

22:37.105 --> 22:40.067
Yes, I felt so bad for her!
So, it was a trick.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.402
-A test.
-Also a trick.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.448
What's the matter?

22:46.531 --> 22:47.991
What's the matter with you?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.035
What are you running from?

22:50.118 --> 22:53.080
Not running from, I'm running to.
This is where I was told to go.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.206
Why are you running?

22:54.289 --> 22:57.250
Why wouldn't I be? It's faster.
Talking about logic, guys.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.879
I'm Kate Wetherall.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.007
-REYNIE: That's Sticky Washington.
-Why do they call you Sticky?

23:04.091 --> 23:07.636
I tend to sort of remember
everything I read or see.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.429
It all just... sticks.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.306
Sticky. Okay, cool.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.766
I've always wanted a nickname.

23:12.849 --> 23:17.312
How about you guys call me
The Great Kate Weather Machine?

23:17.604 --> 23:19.231
-Um...
-Come on, it's good.

23:19.314 --> 23:22.234
No offense, but it sort of takes
a long time to say?

23:22.317 --> 23:23.610
Not if you say it quickly.

23:24.653 --> 23:27.030
Forget it. I've been trying
to get that going for a while.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.199
Guess I just have to let it
come naturally.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.660
-What's the bucket for, Kate?
-Carrying things.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.954
-You've never seen a bucket before?
-What things?

23:35.580 --> 23:41.962
Flashlight, nylon rope, fishing wire,
twine, superglue, bag of marbles,

23:42.045 --> 23:44.881
kaleidoscope, slingshot, magnet...

23:45.465 --> 23:46.633
Swiss Army knife.

23:47.634 --> 23:48.635
I'm a self-contained unit.

23:48.718 --> 23:51.221
Anything that comes up,
I deal with myself. Gotta be ready.

23:51.304 --> 23:52.305
Like, this morning,

23:52.389 --> 23:54.516
some crazy-looking girl
dropped her pencil down the storm drain,

23:54.599 --> 23:55.600
and without this bucket,

23:55.684 --> 23:57.519
she'd have been up the creek
without a paddle.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.647
A paddle might be nice to have.
No, it's too bulky.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.107
Collapsible paddle?

24:02.190 --> 24:04.192
-Anyway...
-Did you help Rhonda get her pencil back?

24:04.818 --> 24:05.819
Of course, I did.

24:05.902 --> 24:07.946
It's tough to get a pencil
out of a ten-and-a-quarter inch crack

24:08.029 --> 24:09.114
at the bottom of a storm drain

24:09.197 --> 24:10.907
-without a bucket full of stuff.
-No kidding.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.951
Hold it. How did you know
the girl's name was Rhonda?

24:13.743 --> 24:16.872
-The same thing happened to both of us.
-We think she was part of the test.

24:16.955 --> 24:20.459
Of course, she was a part of the test.
I knew that in, like, five seconds.

24:20.542 --> 24:24.504
Less. I'm Krista.
Nice to finally meet the competition.

24:24.588 --> 24:28.091
-Pleased to meet you, Krista.
-That's "please" to meet you. No D.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.886
-Actually, I don't think...
-Pretty sure of it.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.847
Oh, this is Dewey.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.184
So, is this everybody who passed the test?

24:37.267 --> 24:38.768
I didn't pass.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.230
I mean, I don't think
I got any of the questions right.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.442
I helped the lady in charge escape
a bunch of crazy parents afterwards.

24:45.525 --> 24:49.654
Started a small fire as a diversion.
Easily containable. No injuries.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.157
-Afterwards, she told me to come here.
-

24:52.240 --> 24:55.494
Okay, everybody here? Proceed to room 7B.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.875
Down this hall, to the right.

25:19.392 --> 25:23.647
Your next test is through that door.
You'll go in one at a time.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.398
Follow the instructions.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.360
I'll be watching.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.695
Geez. How about a hello?

25:34.032 --> 25:34.950
Hello.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.663
I am Milligan.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.248
Krista.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.543
-You're first.
-You know it.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.241
No.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.870
What do you mean by "no"?

26:21.288 --> 26:23.456
The task is impossible. It can't be done.

26:23.540 --> 26:27.794
The test is an attempt to trick us.
So, my answer is no.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.381
You may go home now.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.342
What?

26:34.926 --> 26:37.137
You may go.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.351
No!

26:49.149 --> 26:50.400
Next.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.068
STICKY: You walked across?

28:15.485 --> 28:18.029
The sign said,
"Without setting foot on a square."

28:18.571 --> 28:22.450
It turns out, all the tiles
are slightly longer than they are wide.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.786
So, they're not squares,
they're rectangles.

28:24.869 --> 28:25.954
Hmm.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.375
You all passed. Follow me...

28:32.043 --> 28:33.461
downstairs.

28:44.931 --> 28:48.059
-STICKY: Why are we all the way down here?
-Final test ahead.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.229
At least it's a nice sewer. Ugh.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.108
-I mean, it's an okay sewer.
-

28:58.737 --> 29:01.030
SEWER WORKER:
I had another panic attack last night.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.284
Really? Did any wonder
what's The Emergency going on?

29:04.367 --> 29:07.996
-Yeah, it's like nobody's at the wheel.
-You got that right.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.165
I'm taking my money out of the bank.

29:15.336 --> 29:16.880
I've noticed something.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.799
The smell? The decreased visibility?
The flood danger?

29:20.592 --> 29:23.303
You've got a point, but, no.
They haven't mentioned a scholarship

29:23.386 --> 29:26.014
or the Boatwright Academy
once this whole time.

29:26.097 --> 29:30.059
It's a weird way to approach
a fancy school, through a sewer.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.719
-REYNIE: Hey, come on.
-

30:04.803 --> 30:07.722
STICKY:
Whoa! Is this the Boatwright Academy?

30:07.806 --> 30:10.016
Wait here. I'll be back.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.480
Now what?

30:16.064 --> 30:18.399
Has anyone been allowed
to call their parents?

30:18.483 --> 30:20.568
That would show weakness.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.821
I told my parents
not to expect to hear from me.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.448
Yes... I did that, too.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.368
REYNIE: What about you, Kate?

30:28.993 --> 30:30.787
I don't have anybody to call.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.997
My mother died when I was a baby,

30:33.081 --> 30:35.250
and my father ran away and left me
when I was three.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.800
Guys, it's really fine.
Really, I don't even remember them.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.219
You don't remember them at all?

30:50.098 --> 30:53.226
Actually, that's not totally true.
I do have one memory.

30:53.685 --> 30:57.063
So, down the road from our house
was this old millpond,

30:57.146 --> 30:59.190
and my dad took me there to swim once.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.110
I was only three,
but I was a good swimmer.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.281
I laughed and splashed around
till I was exhausted.

31:06.781 --> 31:09.325
I can't really picture his face.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.787
I remember how his arms felt,
lifting me out of the water.

31:13.538 --> 31:16.916
They were strong. Warm from the sun.

31:19.168 --> 31:22.380
I asked if we could go back sometime
and he said, "Of course, Katie-Cat."

31:22.839 --> 31:25.967
'Cause that's what
he called me, Katie-Cat.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.096
But next thing I know, he was gone,
and I was in an orphanage.

31:30.805 --> 31:33.057
-That's terrible.
-It was a long time ago.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.226
Besides, circus life
was really good for me.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.769
-Circus life?
-Oh, yeah.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.646
I ran away from the orphanage
to join the circus.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.691
Learned a craft, met some people.
It was a great couple years.

31:41.774 --> 31:45.111
But then I read about this test,
and I thought, "That's for me."

31:46.195 --> 31:47.280
Do you ever miss your dad?

31:48.364 --> 31:49.240
What's to miss?

31:50.408 --> 31:51.451
He chose to leave me.

31:51.534 --> 31:54.162
I'd rather hang out
with elephants and clowns.

31:54.829 --> 31:55.705
What about you?

31:57.832 --> 31:58.917
KATE: You get it.

32:00.126 --> 32:01.169
I can tell.

32:03.254 --> 32:08.760
I never really knew my parents,
so I don't specifically miss them, but...

32:09.177 --> 32:10.345
But, generally, you do?

32:14.933 --> 32:15.975
DEWEY: My parents love me.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.395
They call me their miracle.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.400
I'm back.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.491
It's time.

32:39.999 --> 32:42.251
Is this the admissions office?

32:42.835 --> 32:43.836
I don't know.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.097
Hello?

32:57.642 --> 33:00.436
-All the rooms are the same.
-Well done, genius.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.272
That was rude and uncalled for.
You should apologize.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.732
RHONDA: Hello, children.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.403
Rhonda?

33:08.861 --> 33:12.281
-That is still my name.
-You tricked us.

33:12.365 --> 33:15.118
-Ah, just doing my job.
-You're not a kid.

33:15.201 --> 33:16.995
Mm-mm. Not a kid.

33:17.078 --> 33:21.374
So! Here you are. The final section.

33:21.749 --> 33:25.461
You have five minutes to navigate
the maze, climb the stairway,

33:25.545 --> 33:27.380
and ring the bell at the top.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.216
You should be able to do this
with your eyes closed.

33:30.299 --> 33:31.926
Keep in mind, however,

33:32.010 --> 33:36.180
that we can only take the first
three of you who ring that bell.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.727
So, I'll start you each
in different rooms.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.938
When you hear the bell... off you go.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.023
Hmm.

33:56.617 --> 34:02.498
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.960
One, two, three, four...

34:06.753 --> 34:10.214
Dead end. One, two...

34:20.975 --> 34:22.477
Karate!

34:25.521 --> 34:28.357
STICKY: Eight, nine, ten, eleven.

34:28.441 --> 34:32.070
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

34:49.295 --> 34:52.048
RHONDA: You should be able to do this
with your eyes closed.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.053
REYNIE: Braille.

35:25.998 --> 35:27.125
REYNIE: Sticky!

35:27.750 --> 35:29.669
What are you doing? You were ahead!

35:29.752 --> 35:32.547
-I heard you screeching.
-It was more of a yell.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.341
-It did the job. Are you okay?
-I think so.

35:37.426 --> 35:39.887
Dewey. Just go. Only 15 seconds left.

35:40.471 --> 35:41.472
Nope.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.776
Five minutes, ten seconds.

35:54.527 --> 35:57.947
So, Dewey was the only one
to ring the bell in the prescribed time.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.991
Word of advice, cardio.

36:01.325 --> 36:04.245
Kate got here on time,
but she refused to ring the bell.

36:04.453 --> 36:05.830
I thought I'd wait to ring it
with you two.

36:14.839 --> 36:18.593
Well done.
Dewey, Milligan will escort you home.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.304
What? No. But you said the first three.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.931
Yes. And these were the first three
to ring the bell.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.725
Unless you rang it with two others?

36:25.808 --> 36:28.144
-This isn't fair!
-I don't disagree.

36:28.227 --> 36:30.062
What... You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.440
He's gonna...
he's gonna paper you to death!

36:34.817 --> 36:37.945
Congratulations. You've all passed.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.239
No more tests?

36:40.323 --> 36:43.284
No more tests. We have our team.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.890
What's in there?

37:05.973 --> 37:11.812
Truly, one of the preeminent ethicists,
moralists, and scientists of our time.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.816
Mr. Benedict.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.502
Mr. Nicholas Benedict.

37:34.585 --> 37:38.005
BENEDICT: Oh, hello!
Welcome! Congratulations!

37:38.923 --> 37:40.216
-Hello?
-Oh.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.053
There we are. Hello.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.098
I'm the aforementioned Mr. Benedict.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.143
-REYNIE: Hello, sir.
-Hello.

37:51.602 --> 37:55.314
Oh, Reynie, Sticky, Kate.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.565
Oh.

37:56.649 --> 37:59.151
I'm so glad you're here. Please, come in.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.319
Come in.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.905
Just have a seat right there.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.782
There we are.

38:05.491 --> 38:08.577
All right. You look hungry.
Of course, you must be.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.705
-I could eat.
-Number Two, yes?

38:11.956 --> 38:15.209
This is Number Two's famous fruit leather.
It's incredible.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.669
I highly recommend the pineapple.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.380
-Oh, we only have tree bark.
-Don't eat that.

38:19.964 --> 38:23.050
-I'm okay. Thanks.
-But, no worries.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.970
After our fourth arrives, we'll have
a full meal after the orientation.

38:26.429 --> 38:29.098
-A fourth?
-Yes! A fourth member of the team!

38:29.640 --> 38:33.144
-Please, not Dewey.
-No, it's not Dewey. It's someone...

38:33.227 --> 38:36.522
What's the best way to say this?
Someone much better in most ways.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.399
But in some ways, much worse.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.444
GIRL: This place is ugly
and smells like eggs.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.280
It's disgusting.

38:44.363 --> 38:46.782
Ah... Here we are.

38:47.700 --> 38:52.163
Friends, allow me to acquaint you
with your fourth, Constance Contraire.

38:52.246 --> 38:54.498
Actually, the smell might
be coming from this guy.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.959
-Hmm.
-Heard of a toothbrush, old man?

38:58.669 --> 39:01.422
-Ah...
-But we've never seen her.

39:01.505 --> 39:02.757
-You see me now.
-Mm-hm.

39:02.840 --> 39:08.262
Yes. Constance approached today's tests
in a less conventional manner.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.665
I apologize for nothing.

39:36.749 --> 39:39.752
But how is she here
if she didn't pass any of the tests?

39:39.835 --> 39:42.713
"But how is she here
if she didn't pass any of the tests?"

39:43.672 --> 39:45.758
-You're very unpleasant.
-Okay!

39:45.841 --> 39:47.301
Uh, to answer your question, Sticky,

39:47.385 --> 39:49.178
you know there's tests,
and then there's tests.

39:49.261 --> 39:51.847
And then there's rules,
and then there's, you know, rules.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.724
Which are tools for you fools.

39:55.768 --> 39:56.727
Okay.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.189
-Oh, Mr. Benedict. Mr. Benedict.
-

40:01.065 --> 40:02.066
Okay...

40:02.149 --> 40:03.275
No. I would not use this one.

40:03.359 --> 40:05.903
-I would not use the...
-No, he likes the... He like... Sir.

40:05.986 --> 40:08.155
-Hmm. How long was I out?
-Mere seconds, sir.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.490
Mere sec...

40:09.573 --> 40:13.494
Well, here's a helpful fact.
I have type 1 narcolepsy with cataplexy.

40:14.328 --> 40:15.746
Quite severely, I might add.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.541
It's brought on by extremes,
wouldn't you say?

40:18.624 --> 40:19.542
-Oh, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.169
You know, extreme emotions,
mainly from a root of joy.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.840
Um, sometimes the absurdity
of the universe, a good pun...

40:25.923 --> 40:28.634
Constance, apparently.

40:28.717 --> 40:30.052
Sir. Sir.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.137
Oh, yeah. Hmm.

40:31.345 --> 40:32.763
You know, this plaid is no accident.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.891
This particular pattern, it...

40:37.059 --> 40:38.352
It calms me.

40:41.105 --> 40:45.276
Am I the only one who's
going to acknowledge that this is weird?

40:45.359 --> 40:46.402
No, it is. It is.

40:46.485 --> 40:48.779
And I can't believe I've waited
this long to say this,

40:48.863 --> 40:50.781
you should all be so proud of yourselves.

40:51.323 --> 40:55.077
Each of you richly deserve
to go to the Boatwright Academy.

41:01.917 --> 41:04.879
Unfortunately, however,
no one's going to the Boatwright Academy.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.630
-What?
-That was a ruse.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.174
-A lie!
-That was a ruse.

41:08.257 --> 41:11.385
-Why would you lie to us?
-Yeah. Or ruse us.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.888
-No, no, no. Please, please, please.
-There's always a catch!

41:14.805 --> 41:18.517
-Why are we here? What is the truth?
-Reynie!

41:19.310 --> 41:21.395
That's the right question.
That's the right question.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.649
And if I may, allow me to ask you one.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.694
What is it that you all have
in common, hmm?

41:28.777 --> 41:30.779
We all passed your boring tests.

41:30.863 --> 41:31.822
Hmm.

41:36.952 --> 41:38.662
We're all alone.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.123
Yes.

41:43.751 --> 41:47.379
But most importantly, it was clear
that you all possess a quality

41:47.463 --> 41:51.133
that is severely lacking in our society.

41:51.967 --> 41:52.843
What quality?

41:54.220 --> 41:55.304
Empathy.

41:56.931 --> 41:58.057
You see others.

42:00.309 --> 42:02.895
-You care for others.
-Ha!

42:03.812 --> 42:05.481
You love truth.

42:06.232 --> 42:08.317
In fact, I think you may be
among the few capable

42:08.400 --> 42:09.818
of seeing the truth anymore.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.153
Oh...

42:11.237 --> 42:15.324
But what that does is help you
to resist the disinformation

42:15.407 --> 42:17.493
that's being fed to us every single day.

42:17.576 --> 42:22.414
And, yes, Reynie. Yes, you were alone,
but look at you now! Look!

42:24.124 --> 42:25.292
I see fear.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.002
And bad fashion.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.924
No, you're a team. A team.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.513
We're asking you to go on a mission.

42:38.472 --> 42:40.474
A risky undercover mission.

42:41.141 --> 42:43.978
And, unfortunately, one that can
only be accomplished by children.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.731
A team of children.

42:47.815 --> 42:50.234
Please understand,
I don't take this lightly.

42:50.317 --> 42:53.445
I don't. And you may leave.
You may walk out and leave.

42:54.697 --> 42:59.118
But I truly believe that you are
in more danger if we do nothing.

43:02.621 --> 43:05.249
I just really wanted
to go to the Boatwright Academy.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.376
I know. I'm sorry.

43:07.459 --> 43:09.878
Their science wing
is supposed to be unreal.

43:09.962 --> 43:11.380
Honestly, it's amazing.

43:11.463 --> 43:15.301
So, you lied to us all because you needed
a bunch of smart orphans

43:15.384 --> 43:16.844
to do a deadly mission.

43:17.344 --> 43:18.262
I get it.

43:19.179 --> 43:22.683
-Ideally not deadly.
-So, out with it.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.936
What is happening?

43:29.773 --> 43:31.400
This is happening.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.947
-With the Emergency...

43:39.908 --> 43:41.744
The Emergency.

43:42.494 --> 43:43.704
I'm sure you've heard of it.

43:43.787 --> 43:45.581
-How could we not have?
-BENEDICT: Of course.

43:46.040 --> 43:49.126
I'm convinced that this Emergency
that has everyone so anxious,

43:49.209 --> 43:52.046
so distracted, that is threatening
to tear our society apart,

43:52.129 --> 43:54.923
is a fiction created by one person.

43:55.007 --> 43:55.966
One.

43:57.176 --> 44:00.512
-Um, who?
-We don't know. We don't know. But this...

44:01.722 --> 44:04.058
-Disgraceful machinator.
-That's it. Yeah. That's... What?

44:04.141 --> 44:07.978
-Machinator.
-Yes. They work in the shadows.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.105
Well, then... how?

44:10.189 --> 44:13.108
By sending secret, undetectable messages

44:13.192 --> 44:16.987
designed to distract us,
designed to scare us, divide us.

44:18.614 --> 44:21.367
Oh, and this sender
is perfecting a system.

44:21.450 --> 44:22.576
Which does what?

44:22.660 --> 44:25.788
It's a sort of mass hypnosis

44:25.871 --> 44:29.541
that would enable the sender
to do virtually anything.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.960
How do we know you're telling the truth?

44:32.544 --> 44:36.382
You don't. We only just met.
And look at you and you.

44:36.465 --> 44:38.967
You're smart, sensitive,
intuitive children

44:39.051 --> 44:40.928
who have every right to question me.

44:41.011 --> 44:45.432
Oh, but I'm counting on the idea
that you can already sense the truth,

44:45.516 --> 44:48.102
and you care enough
to do something about it.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.444
Please hear me.

44:58.070 --> 45:01.115
You are needed.

45:04.451 --> 45:07.121
I know this world
has made you feel unwanted,

45:07.204 --> 45:11.166
abandoned, angry, but it needs you.

45:11.750 --> 45:13.168
Desperately.

45:15.421 --> 45:16.505
It doesn't know it,

45:16.588 --> 45:19.466
but your unique talents
can save it from this coming storm.

45:20.801 --> 45:22.761
The truth is our world
may never appreciate you

45:22.845 --> 45:25.514
or see what makes you special,
but I see it.

45:27.224 --> 45:28.517
I see hope.

45:31.395 --> 45:34.815
And even if you decide
to not choose this mission...

45:35.315 --> 45:39.236
I feel so honored to have crossed paths

45:39.319 --> 45:42.823
with such brilliant children.

45:50.497 --> 45:52.207
Thank you for the time.

46:04.303 --> 46:05.512
Needed?

46:12.019 --> 46:13.103
Yes.

46:22.696 --> 46:24.531
What's happening? What's the alarm for?

46:27.159 --> 46:29.119
Your responsibilities, uh...

46:29.828 --> 46:32.498
seem... seem to have begun quicker
than we thought.

46:32.831 --> 46:33.707
Uh-oh.
