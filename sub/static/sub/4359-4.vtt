Hey, one more house to go.

Good.

drives down the Lane

two seconds left, shoots...

01:11.120 --> 01:12.280
And misses.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.400
Okay, Alex, let's go.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.640
Shouldn't you put that 
 on the porch?

01:16.640 --> 01:18.960
I don't go past the sidewalk 
 at this house.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.520
Ray, they won't be 
 able to find it

01:21.520 --> 01:23.120
there in the bushes.

 occupy this residence.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.880
<i>And they read 
 Paradise Valley view?</i>

01:28.880 --> 01:31.760
All I know is, 
 I deliver the paper one day

01:31.760 --> 01:33.440
and the next it's gone.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.400
And the bill is always paid

01:35.400 --> 01:37.480
but I never see anyone 
 come or go.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.480
Ghosts don't pay bills, Ray.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.120
Come on, go get it.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.880
No way. If you want that paper 
 moved, you do it yourself.

 No one will notice.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.880
So what are you doing 
 tomorrow night?

02:42.880 --> 02:46.480
Nothing. Mom and Dad are going 
 to the Plant costume party

02:46.480 --> 02:48.600
so I'm stuck here 
 with candy duty.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.880
<i>( Sighing )</i>

02:49.880 --> 02:52.920
Somebody has to take care 
 of the little darlings.

Hey, what's going on 
 in here?

02:54.720 --> 02:57.120
Are you wearing 
 this again?

02:57.120 --> 02:58.040
Yes.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.000
Good night.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.240
I thought you girls 
 were asleep.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.640
Bryce just called.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.360
He said he'll be by 
 tomorrow night at 7:00

03:07.360 --> 03:08.600
to help you out.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.720

Good night. 
 Sweet dreams.

Bryce?

03:13.800 --> 03:14.480
Bryce?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.360
Oh, Annie, I'm so sorry

03:17.360 --> 03:20.160
you have to stay home 
 alone with Bryce.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.280
<i>( Angry grunt )</i>

03:21.280 --> 03:22.400

03:36.320 --> 03:37.600
Annie?

03:37.600 --> 03:39.360
I'm not talking to you.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.960
You have to talk to me, 
 you're my sister.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.560
You know that old house 
 on the edge of dearborn way?

03:47.560 --> 03:50.200
Yeah, everybody knows 
 about that place.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.360
It was the first one built 
 in Paradise Valley.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.040
Well, Ray says that 
 ghosts live there.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.440
He should know, he's from 
 another world himself.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.520
Come on, Annie, 
 be serious.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.360
Well, I heard

04:05.360 --> 04:08.320
a woman lived there 
 a long time ago with her kids

04:08.320 --> 04:09.720
and she started acting

04:09.720 --> 04:11.000
really weird.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.160
She wouldn't let them go 
 to school or out to play.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.200
Things like that.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.720
Really?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.720
People started complaining 
 about strange noises

04:19.720 --> 04:21.160
coming from the house.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.600
So one day, 
 they went over to the house

04:23.600 --> 04:24.880
broke down the door

04:24.880 --> 04:26.920
and took the kids 
 away from her.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.600
And for years, 
 this woman would just

04:29.600 --> 04:32.720
stand up at the top of 
 the stairs and she would just

04:32.720 --> 04:35.480
wait for the kids 
 to come back.

04:35.480 --> 04:39.200
The woman finally died 
 and they found her body.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.560
It wasn't pretty.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.920
How did she die?

04:41.920 --> 04:43.800
Nobody really knows for sure.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.720
Some people say she went crazy 
 and starved herself to death.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.760
Other people say

04:48.760 --> 04:50.920
that her ghost 
 still wanders there

04:50.920 --> 04:52.040
night after night

04:52.040 --> 04:53.760
searching 
 for her children.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.920
It couldn't be true, 
 could it?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.280
Alex, you are so gullible!

05:00.280 --> 05:02.360
It's just a story.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.160
There are no such thing 
 as ghosts.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.840
Maybe some unexplained 
 paranormal phenomenon

05:08.840 --> 05:10.120
but no ghosts.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.400

[Mrs. Mack] 
 Alex, are you okay?

06:26.040 --> 06:27.320
It was a nightmare.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.080
[Mr. Mack] 
 It's okay, honey.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.080
Maybe it was 
 something she ate?

06:31.080 --> 06:33.120
I think it's all this 
 Halloween stuff.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.160
No, I was telling her 
 this story

06:35.160 --> 06:37.320
about that house 
 on dearborn way.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.040
The one with 
 the crazy woman

06:39.040 --> 06:41.000

 her husband and kids

06:43.240 --> 06:45.200
It's just a story, Alex.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.720
There's nothing 
 to worry about.

 going to be okay.

And check out my creation.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.960
Annie, what are you 
 dressed as?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.040
A human?

07:00.040 --> 07:01.960
You both look 
 ridiculous.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.880
Where did you get 
 that outfit?

07:03.880 --> 07:05.400
A promotional campaign

07:05.400 --> 07:07.960
for my dad's new line 
 of lab equipment.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.600
He sells 
 to all the labs.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.320
Here's his business card.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.640
Maybe I could get you 
 a student discount.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.840

Thanks, Ray. 
 Hey, Louis.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.320
Hey, Alex.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.000
So elegantly grunge.

Annie, you're not 
 wearing a costume?

07:25.520 --> 07:28.240
No, I'm a little beyond 
 that phase now.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.640
Let's get organized.

 and rest breaks...

07:45.320 --> 07:47.320
Hmm, we should hit 150 houses.

This could be a record-breaking 
 season for us, Alex.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.480

 a little intense.

Cool.

Alex, look at your sister.

Something happens

Well, thank you, Louis... 
 I think.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.320
Alex, are you sure 
 those two belong to you?

08:33.320 --> 08:35.679
Sometimes, Ray, 
 I'm not too sure.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.159
Come on, we're out of here.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.280

 we! See you later.

It's really been 
 a slow year.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.760
Yeah, Halloween seems 
 to have this cyclical pattern.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.160
I like that this year.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.480
It's a little quiet.

You know that house 
 down this block?

10:22.680 --> 10:24.520
The woman that lived there 
 was crazy

10:24.520 --> 10:26.400
and locked her kids 
 in the basement.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.800
When other kids came over

10:27.800 --> 10:29.640
she'd lock them up 
 in little cages.

10:29.640 --> 10:30.840
<i> You should be locked up.</i>

10:30.840 --> 10:32.400
I know for a fact

10:32.400 --> 10:35.960
that there are 231 short adults 
 in that basement right now.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.000
How do you know?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.360
I am Louis Driscoll.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.880
I have a need to know.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.240
My cousin has a friend 
 who used to live here

10:42.240 --> 10:45.280
and his brother knew someone 
 who actually saw the cages.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.520
Louis, you're a nut.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.000
Alex, that would explain 
 the newspapers.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.800
There's not much anyone can do 
 but read if they're locked up.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.200
What do you say, 
 Alex?

10:54.200 --> 10:55.440
Let's check it out.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.880
Or are you 
 too scared?

10:56.880 --> 10:59.920
All right, Louis. 
 Let's go.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.160

11:17.800 --> 11:19.040

11:19.040 --> 11:20.320
The gateway

11:20.320 --> 11:23.640
between our world... 
 And theirs.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.040
What do you mean, "theirs"?

11:25.040 --> 11:27.600
He must mean 
 the 231 short, caged adults.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.720
Alex, I dare you to go up 
 and knock on the door.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.240
If you guys come with me.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.360
I'm not going.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.280
I have rules about this house.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.360
Oh, come on, Ray, 
 just say yes.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.080
Alex will never go 
 up to the door anyway.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.200
How do you know?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.480
Why don't you go 
 up there, then?

11:42.480 --> 11:43.760
This is stupid.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.640

11:58.440 --> 12:00.320
There, she knocked. 
 Let's go.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.040
Knock again, louder.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.120
<i>( Knocking louder )</i>

14:09.840 --> 14:11.320
You were knocking.

Don't you want to see me?

What was that?

14:32.640 --> 14:34.520
It was nothing, Ray, 
 let's go.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.000
Did you see 
 that light?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.720
Maybe it was an... 
 Electrical problem.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.720
We've got to go back 
 and get her.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.680
No. Let's go and call 9-1-1.

14:42.680 --> 14:45.240
I'm not leaving 
 my best friend alone.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.760
You do what you want

14:46.760 --> 14:49.440
but I'm 
 going back.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.600
Ray!

Raymond, wait up!

14:52.640 --> 14:54.680

 Quit pushing.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.600
There. Okay, okay.

 Alex, all right?

Please don't hurt me.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.600
Why would I do that?

15:52.600 --> 15:55.360
People say you locked 
 your children in the basement.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.960
Oh! Every neighborhood

15:56.960 --> 15:58.960

 haunted-house story.

Guess I'm 
 Paradise Valley's.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.040
Why won't you let me move?

16:04.040 --> 16:05.200
Well...

16:05.200 --> 16:07.920
We can't keep tossing 
 the furniture about

16:07.920 --> 16:09.640
all evening, 
 now, can we?

16:11.560 --> 16:12.960
I thought it was 
 the light

16:12.960 --> 16:14.200
that scared you.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.000
I need things bright in here.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.600
My eyes aren't that good.

16:19.280 --> 16:22.040
So, where are your children?

16:22.040 --> 16:22.760
Oh.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.440
<i>( Chuckles )</i>

16:25.440 --> 16:28.600
That's my granddaughter.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.200
We raised her.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.320
What a handful she was.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.400
Was?

16:33.400 --> 16:34.920
We haven't seen her in years.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.120
She was a 
 brilliant child.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.360
A little bossy.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.520
Loved numbers.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.200
Where is she?

16:42.200 --> 16:43.720
She went away to school.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.640
She wasn't much older than you

16:45.640 --> 16:47.800
but the universities wanted her.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.320
People would call, 
 or come by

16:51.320 --> 16:52.920
to visit for the holidays

16:52.920 --> 16:55.400
and I'd lie to them 
 about where she was.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.840
I couldn't bear 
 to tell them

16:56.840 --> 16:59.200
that our granddaughter 
 wasn't speaking to us.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.880
I'd say she was asleep, 
 that she was out

17:01.880 --> 17:03.520
that she'd be back soon.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.560
Well, you do that long enough

17:05.560 --> 17:07.520
and people 
 soon stop asking.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.160
Just because I wanted 
 to keep it a secret.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.560
That little secret 
 started a lot of stories.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.520
I've never told anyone before.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.720
What would people think 
 about someone

17:22.720 --> 17:26.240
whose granddaughter doesn't want 
 to talk to them anymore?

17:27.359 --> 17:28.840
I think you're okay.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.240
Thank you, Alex.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.680
How do you know my name?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.600
I've been here a long time.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.200
I've seen you grow up.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.600
In fact, I've seen

17:37.600 --> 17:40.040
all of Paradise Valley grow up.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.520
By the way

17:41.520 --> 17:44.560
those were some 
 interesting little tricks

17:44.560 --> 17:45.640
you were doing.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.320
I loved that 
 melting thing.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.320
Oh, no, you can't tell anyone.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.120
They'll fire my dad 
 and they'll cut me up.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.640
Oh, calm down, my dear.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.400
Who could I possibly tell?

17:55.400 --> 17:57.000
You know 
 my secret.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.720
Now I need you to tell me yours.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.520
Well, it all started one day

18:05.520 --> 18:08.400
when I was walking home 
 from school...

18:08.400 --> 18:09.640
It's definitely the end

18:09.640 --> 18:11.520
of trick or 
 treating for tonight.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.760
I wish it wasn't.

Uh, did many kids

18:56.640 --> 18:57.800
come by tonight?

18:57.800 --> 19:00.360
Yeah. It was 
 an amazing night.

George, it's 
 really late.

Uh, you go 
 ahead, honey.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.840

 hungry.

Bye.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.120
Annie, salami 
 or Turkey?

19:23.080 --> 19:24.880
Annie says that the Plant

19:24.880 --> 19:28.200
is doing everything it can 
 to try and find me

19:28.200 --> 19:31.560
and if that happens, 
 we'll all be in trouble.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.440
What's the matter?

19:34.440 --> 19:35.600
You dear thing.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.120
It's all my fault.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.320
How could it be your fault?

19:39.320 --> 19:41.240
I didn't even know you

19:41.240 --> 19:42.440
until tonight.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.680
After my husband passed away

19:46.680 --> 19:49.160
I sold off all our land.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.120
A company bought it 
 and built that Chemical Plant

19:52.120 --> 19:54.560
that's been giving you 
 all that trouble.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.720
It's not that bad.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.600
Actually, it's kind of cool.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.320
I mean, I was a total dork

19:59.320 --> 20:01.920
before this happened to me.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.400
You don't have 
 to worry.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.800
Ray and I can keep 
 ahead of the Plant.

 Ray?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.560
Are you sure 
 this is a good idea?

20:09.560 --> 20:11.680
Maybe we should 
 come back tomorrow.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.240
Louis, we're going 
 to get Alex out.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.440

 One, two, three.

 Whoa!

 won't you?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.080
For as long as you like.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.720
And remember, Alex, 
 you were never a dork.

Your magic 
 is inside of you.

 visit you

So do I, Alex Mack, so do I.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.840
Have a brilliant life, my dear.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.280
Thanks.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.320
Good-bye.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.320
[Ray] Alex, I'm 
 coming, hang on!

21:02.320 --> 21:04.640
Ray, don't you think 
 we should go?

21:04.640 --> 21:06.200
One more time, 
 come on.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.440
One, two, charge!

21:07.440 --> 21:09.080
[Both] 
 Whoa!

21:11.440 --> 21:12.440
Easy, guys.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.400
[Ray] Alex, 
 are you okay?

21:14.400 --> 21:16.440
Alex, you should 
 have seen Ray.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.880
He was so scared.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.320
Now, I was a little 
 concerned myself

21:20.320 --> 21:24.120
but I try and keep a cool head 
 in this type of situation.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.440
I thought you'd be locked 
 in the basement by now.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.560
No, that's just 
 some silly rumor.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.760
The lady that lives here 
 is actually really nice.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.240
Wait until 
 you meet her.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.520
Meet who, Alex?

21:39.480 --> 21:40.560
Oh...

21:40.560 --> 21:41.600
Nobody.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.560
Let's just go home.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.320
<i>( Door creaking )</i>

21:58.000 --> 21:59.120
You're right, Ray.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.320
I probably just 
 imagined it all.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.480
So you were just 
 trying to scare us?

22:03.480 --> 22:06.440
Well, Louis Driscoll 
 doesn't scare that easily.

22:06.440 --> 22:07.560
No, sir.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.360
Now, Ray here

22:09.360 --> 22:11.440
he does get 
 a little frightened.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.240
You sure you're 
 okay, Alex?

22:13.240 --> 22:15.640
Never better.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.480
Let's go. 
 Come on.
