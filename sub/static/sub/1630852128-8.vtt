WEBVTT

00:16.057 --> 00:19.602
Oh my God.
I can't believe I'm, like, the top two.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.895
Top two.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.231
-You're in the top two!
-Oh my God!

00:24.441 --> 00:27.777
-Congratulations. I told you.
-Thank you.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.279
I told you. You deserve it.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.072
I do want it pretty bad.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.034
-Yeah. As you should.
-Obviously, I wanna win really bad.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.411
And of course
it's gonna be me against her.

00:36.494 --> 00:37.746
Yeah. That… that's…

00:37.829 --> 00:40.040
<i>-That's</i> the funny part.
-That's really funny.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.917
I mean, she did really good.
I'm not saying that she's not doing good.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.627
-She's done really good.
-That made…

00:45.128 --> 00:49.591
That after "the firing,"
and you were the one she fired…

00:49.674 --> 00:51.009
I'm not gonna let her win.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.429
After everything
she's been putting me through, hell no.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.181
I hope
you're on my team.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.725
-We'll see.
-I know. It's gonna be crazy.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.894
We'll see.
No idea how they'll divide it up,

01:00.977 --> 01:02.270
no idea what the challenge is,

01:02.353 --> 01:04.731
but I know that,
with four people on the team,

01:04.814 --> 01:07.442
Chef's gonna expect something amazing.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.236
I really hope
I get to have you on my team,

01:10.320 --> 01:11.988
Daniel, and Thiago.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.533
Oh,
she ain't gonna let that happen.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.246
The only thing that will be worrisome

01:20.330 --> 01:22.916
is if Daniel and Juan
are on the same team,

01:22.999 --> 01:27.837
because they both
are really strong in, um, carving,

01:28.379 --> 01:32.050
and I would like to break that dynamic up,
from a strategic point of view.

01:32.133 --> 01:36.096
If it's not a human,
I'm pretty good at sculpting.

01:36.179 --> 01:39.265
-And I'm not putting a human on anything.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.810
If I can help it.
Unless the challenge is a human.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.229
-You're gonna get it. You gotta claim it.
-Exactly.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.065
And speak it into the…
into the world, the universe.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.818
-Thank you for everything.
-No, I'm so happy.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.277
-We're gonna win this.
-Yes.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.998
-What is it?

02:04.082 --> 02:05.583
-What is it?!
-Oh my God!

02:07.168 --> 02:09.879
-It's a pterodactyl! Oh my God!

02:12.465 --> 02:14.634
It's got
so much movement to it.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.679
-And he's got a fish.
-That is amazing. Look at that.

02:17.762 --> 02:21.808
He just brought him to life.
Like, you felt like he was looking at you.

02:21.891 --> 02:26.062
It was amazing,
the work that he put into that sculpture.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.902
Look at that rock.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.363
-Wow.
-All right, chefs, what am I sculpting?

02:36.239 --> 02:38.283
-Hey, guys.
-Hello, Chef.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.535
-Do you like him?
-Yeah.

02:40.618 --> 02:43.079
So, today's theme is Prehistoric.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.582
This is all about sculpting.

02:45.665 --> 02:46.708
<i>Oui.</i>

02:46.791 --> 02:49.752
Hundred percent chocolate,
hundred percent sculpted.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.880
-Yikes.
-All right, you two.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.133
I know it's a very difficult type
of exercise.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.677
What's difficult
to capture sometimes in sculpting,

02:57.760 --> 03:01.222
it's the… the reaction,
the face, the emotion it's conveying.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.600
You can tell this is snack time.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.393
The fish doesn't like it too much.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.896
You know, it's trying to scream
and run for his life.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.397
Uh, pieces you add,

03:09.480 --> 03:12.025
not only texture-wise, color-wise,

03:12.108 --> 03:14.903
bring some life to your piece.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.197
-Is the body hollow?
-Hollow.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.032
There's a skeleton in there?

03:19.115 --> 03:21.701
Arms and legs
has a dark chocolate skeleton.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.537
All the rest is just Robot Coupe chocolate
on the bones.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.122
You polish the whole thing,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.208
and you have this beautiful baby.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.709
Wow.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.420
I'm very good at linear lines,

03:32.503 --> 03:36.466
but I don't have a lot of experience
sculpting, so, yeah, I thought,

03:36.549 --> 03:40.094
"Oh, that's… This is gonna be a challenge.
I'm gonna have to think through this."

03:41.429 --> 03:43.890
Let me conduct a quick demo
on what I call "the bath."

03:43.973 --> 03:46.434
It is a secret I've never shown

03:46.935 --> 03:50.188
in any of my videos or in any class.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.650
-It will change your sculpting way.
-We're all ready.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.444
I'm going to use hot water,

03:56.527 --> 03:58.071
very hot water,

03:58.154 --> 03:59.322
a brand-new sponge,

03:59.405 --> 04:01.324
and apply a lot of pressure.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.244
You know, you are being told
chocolate and water doesn't go together,

04:04.327 --> 04:05.995
and it's true, for the most part.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.083
But then, when used wisely,
you can get incredible results.

04:10.166 --> 04:14.087
This type of result is impossible to get
by scraping and scraping and scraping.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.382
-That's a secret, okay? Don't tell anyone.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.592
-Whoopsie.
-We're gonna keep it between us.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.886
-I mean, look at this.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.722
-You see the difference of texture?
-Oh yes.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.810
In ten seconds,
we can get something very smooth.

04:28.893 --> 04:32.272
Also, with the water applied
to the milk chocolate,

04:32.355 --> 04:36.776
the milk powder
that milk chocolate contains will dry,

04:36.859 --> 04:39.487
creating a very thin membrane
onto the chocolate,

04:39.570 --> 04:42.407
and will be a… a very nicer shine overall.

04:42.490 --> 04:46.244
I bet it's been hard watching us do it
the wrong way all this time.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.538
I have to say,…
I have to say, I wanted to tell you.

04:48.621 --> 04:52.375
But no, like, the chameleon,
now if you knew about the hot water,

04:52.458 --> 04:54.752
can you imagine
how it would've turned out? Yeah.

04:54.836 --> 04:58.089
He suggested doing a different technique
that I haven't done before.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.551
Such a simple thing,
but it's like, wow. I was blown away.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.515
So, just to do a little recap,

05:07.598 --> 05:10.768
there have been two students
with overall top scores,

05:10.852 --> 05:14.397
that are now eligible to compete
for best student overall in class.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.482
Juan and Mellisa.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.737
Knowing that this is all-or-nothing,
that definitely puts a big pressure.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.115
Fifty-thousand dollars,
I can start following my dreams,

05:24.198 --> 05:25.616
open my own business.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.576
I wanna win.

05:26.659 --> 05:30.288
So for the next chocolate showpiece,
we're gonna build two teams of four.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.458
Juan, knowing
that you are the overall top score,

05:33.541 --> 05:35.209
you're gonna be the first one to pick.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.128
Who would you like to team up with you?

05:37.211 --> 05:39.088
-Daniel.
-You'd like Daniel.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.132
-That was a fast…
-Thank you.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.092
Why Daniel? Because of his hair?

05:45.011 --> 05:47.847
I really like, uh,
the dynamic that Daniel and I have,

05:47.930 --> 05:50.224
and Daniel is a really good sculptor.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.228
-Mellisa, who would you like to pick?
-Thiago.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.438
Thiago. Okay.

05:55.521 --> 05:59.067
I chose him,
um, because I really felt like,

05:59.150 --> 06:02.820
from a sculpture, uh, perspective,
in the remaining people,

06:02.904 --> 06:05.990
he was gonna be the strongest person,
and I really knew

06:06.074 --> 06:09.077
that he couldn't end up on Juan's team.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.038
Okay. Mellisa, round two. You pick first.

06:14.916 --> 06:18.378
I did think about, "Oh, I should take
Tyricia just to sabotage Juan,"

06:18.461 --> 06:20.421
because I knew
he really wanted her.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.756
Just to mess with his head.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.470
Amanda.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.138
Amanda.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.015
And then I thought, "No, that's just…"

06:31.099 --> 06:33.893
I mean, she would just be so miserable
not to be on his team,

06:33.976 --> 06:35.978
so I wasn't gonna do that to her.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.606
Juan, who would you like to pick?

06:38.689 --> 06:40.566
I wanna have my girl Tyricia with me.

06:41.984 --> 06:45.488
Something I told her right away was,
"If I'm gonna win, I want you by my side."

06:45.571 --> 06:47.907
Round three. Juan, you pick first.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.828
Uh, and it's Cedrick and Stephanie.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.164
-Oh God. It's so difficult.
-You cannot pick both.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.251
-That would be cheating.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.131
-I'm gonna go with Cedrick.
-Okay.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.008
Mellisa,
Stephanie will be joining your team.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.970
-We didn't work yet together.
-Oh yeah, we didn't work together.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.930
-Love that spirit.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.684
So just to remind you the rules,
the theme is Prehistoric,

07:14.767 --> 07:19.522
you're gonna have 16 hours
to make a four-feet-tall showpiece.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.859
I want the dominance
of this piece to be sculpting.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.319
I want to see leadership from you.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.072
You can go crazy.
This is the last exercise.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.615
I want to be wowed.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.326
It's gonna be Juan versus Mellisa.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.912
May the best chocolatier win.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.372
And you may begin.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.336
-How are we setting this up?
-Yeah. Let's do it.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.672
I do believe
that in order to win,

07:44.755 --> 07:47.717
you have to 100% believe in yourself,
and I believe in myself.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.636
I really do think that I…

07:50.720 --> 07:53.806
I have what it takes to win this.
I really do.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.641
We're gonna have a cave dwelling

07:55.725 --> 07:58.478
up into a nest of little dinosaur eggs.

07:58.561 --> 08:02.190
The little dinosaur guy
will be coming up out of egg shells.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.276
I like a T. rex.
And you want three of them?

08:05.359 --> 08:07.236
One with a little butt out, one kinda up,

08:07.320 --> 08:09.197
and one with a mouth open would be cool.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.074
-You need these sculpted guys to pop.
-Yep.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.744
-We are part of this team.
-Yeah.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.914
-We are going to give it 1001%.
-And that's what I want. Exactly.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.501
I don't want this piece to be me,
I want this piece to be us.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.628
I'm gonna work hard to come in first,

08:23.711 --> 08:25.129
and I'm gonna get this.

08:25.213 --> 08:29.383
We have the rock here.
That is gonna be kinda, like, balance.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.845
Put the bird in the middle,
and then we hide the whole bird

08:32.929 --> 08:34.639
with the flowers and the leaves.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.516
Quit calling it a bird.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.893
-The dinosaur bird. The…
-The Tydacedjuan.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.144
The Tydacedjuan.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.438
It would be cool
if they were on both sides.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.440
-The dinosaur head?
-Yeah.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.777
Remember, you shaved a certain amount
when you're digging fossils.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.195
You don't have to shave all of it.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.281
As long as you see
it's kind of starting to be chiseled away.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.533
Yeah. That's a good idea.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.328
Good ideas. Okay.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.871
We got this, guys.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.040
-We got this.
-Yeah!

09:05.378 --> 09:07.505
-Oh, is that for me? Oh, well, thank you!
-Yeah.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.007
-Once we pour it in, just tap it.
-Okay.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.426
-Then put it right in the fridge.
-Got you.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.054
-Mellisa. Team leader.
-Yes, Chef. Yes.

09:15.137 --> 09:18.015
How did you separate the workload
between all your team?

09:18.099 --> 09:20.351
What I wanted to do
was organize it in a way

09:20.434 --> 09:24.313
that everybody has an opportunity
to shine and to 100% contribute.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.732
I think my strength lies
in being a pastry chef

09:26.816 --> 09:29.485
who understands the wisdom
in being a great leader.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.823
I really try to think about how long
it will take each thing to make,

09:33.906 --> 09:36.325
and I write every 15-minute timeline.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.954
So, everybody's got their tasks,
they knew what they were gonna be doing,

09:40.037 --> 09:41.706
and I think it's a huge difference.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.009
-Juan.
-Hi, Chef.

09:53.092 --> 09:56.304
-How did you split all the workload?
-Yes.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.724
I wanna make sure they're doing stuff
they actually have never done.

10:00.725 --> 10:04.353
And the reason why is because
I want all of us to push ourselves.

10:05.104 --> 10:09.025
Juan is so humble,
and he's so… He has such a big heart.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.193
Instead of him wanting
to just win it for himself,

10:11.277 --> 10:13.696
he wanted to win it
for everybody on his team,

10:13.779 --> 10:15.823
and I'm like,
"Forget about everybody else!"

10:15.906 --> 10:18.826
"It's you and Mellisa,
and you need to win this."

10:30.004 --> 10:30.921
Got the leaves.

10:33.257 --> 10:37.511
We wanted some leaves, and the best way
is to use an actual real plant.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.389
Have you ever
done that before, Tyricia?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.725
I've seen it done. I just never did it.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.852
How's it going, Tyricia?

10:44.935 --> 10:47.355
-Doing a second coat on all ten.
-Perfect.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.065
Am I taking too long?

10:49.148 --> 10:52.026
-I figured.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.988
I know so much is riding on this
that I wanna do it right,

10:56.072 --> 10:58.157
so I'm… I'm actually moving too slow,

10:58.240 --> 10:59.825
which is not good.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.037
It's coming along. Yes.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.915
Two different pieces,
two different approaches.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.751
Juan's approach to the way
he manages his team

11:08.834 --> 11:13.005
is actually challenging them to do things
that they've never done before.

11:13.089 --> 11:17.677
So you're gonna make a tube, see,
and then with your board, you're gonna go…

11:18.177 --> 11:20.554
-The thinner they are…
-The better they are.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.098
Because it shows more finesse.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.934
It's risky.
As a teacher, I do love that,

11:25.017 --> 11:27.478
yet, Mellisa's experience
as a business owner

11:27.561 --> 11:29.230
is coming handy in this situation.

11:29.313 --> 11:33.567
-We only need two to go on the outside.
-On the exterior, okay.

11:33.651 --> 11:37.863
Strong leadership usually,
uh, gives you the best results

11:37.947 --> 11:41.242
when you are on the time constraints,
so we'll see.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.080
-You in good shape?
-Yep.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.459
Daniel, before you start the head,
let's build the structure first.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.463
Yeah. Chef, you said 36 inches by 4.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.507
-That's good.
-It's thick.

11:56.590 --> 12:00.219
I'm here to win. I'm here to do everything
that I can to take that crown,

12:00.302 --> 12:02.638
and I want it, and I wanna fight for it.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.808
So I wanted to make sure
that my showpiece is really risky.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.892
Pull here.

12:07.393 --> 12:11.564
It's extremely important
that it's bigger and crazier than before.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.857
Time to win.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.068
-Time to win this, Juan.
-Time to win this one. You're right.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.201
-Yes!

12:25.077 --> 12:27.663
All right.
So I got all our rough skeleton shapes.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.623
I'll keep adding details to them now.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.208
I think we might be the underdog,

12:31.292 --> 12:33.753
because we've seen
what Juan and Daniel can do together

12:33.836 --> 12:35.296
when they worked on that chameleon.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.882
And it was pretty beautiful,
and it was just them two.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.928
-Don't worry. I got you. It'll look good.
-They look so cute! Perfect.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.555
I was excited for sculpting,

12:44.638 --> 12:47.266
because I've sculpted things in the past,
not with chocolate,

12:47.349 --> 12:50.811
and no one's really seen that.
I'm gonna take this to the next level.

12:51.645 --> 12:52.938
-Sir?
-Yes, Chef?

12:54.064 --> 12:55.733
-No way.
-The eye?

12:56.233 --> 13:00.613
You will not do a beautiful face
like this and put those teeny, tiny eyes.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.239
-Needs to be bigger?
-Much bigger.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.992
-We're gonna position them here. Okay?
-Yep, yep, yep.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.911
They should be here. Okay?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.289
-<i>Oui.</i> Thanks.
-You see already?

13:10.372 --> 13:11.415
Okay.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.084
You have the talent.
Don't overthink it.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.419
Thank you, Chef.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.505
Let's start sculpting, shall we?

13:19.840 --> 13:21.634
Get this head perfect.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.178
-Exactly.
-It's all I'm gonna be doing.

13:30.476 --> 13:34.355
Little dino bath.
Okay, this is pretty awesome, gotta say.

13:34.438 --> 13:38.025
-Daniel, you're gonna have fun with this.
-Am I? I'm excited now.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.903
Oh you're gonna love it.
It really is life-changing.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.242
All righty. Let's see
how life-changing this thing is.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.579
Oh wow. I'm excited.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.501
Juan, I can tell
what dinosaur you're doing from his head.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.170
You've heard of the Tydacedjuan?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.172
Yeah.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.675
Tyceddajuan is what Juan named it.

14:02.758 --> 14:06.262
Tyricia, Cedrick,
Daniel, and Juan. Tyceddajuan.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.098
What is it they're gonna be?

14:09.181 --> 14:12.142
It's like the one
that looks like a demented bird.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.020
So it's like a chicken
and a pterodactyl had a baby.

14:15.104 --> 14:15.980
Okay.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.774
I was really hoping
I would be on Mellisa's team.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.069
She is so inspired by what she does.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.573
She pushes you
to be better than you already are.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.032
-Good.
-Nice job.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.286
And that is what sets her apart
and what makes her a winner in my book.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.538
Stephanie is so far away.

14:32.621 --> 14:36.125
-Still don't feel we're working together.
-I can't hear you. I'm so far.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.754
-We need many feathers, correct?
-Many feathers. A lot of feathers.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.215
Cedrick is an amazing feather machine.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.301
-Team leaders?
-Yes, Chef?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.970
Stop working for a moment. Listen to me.

14:48.053 --> 14:52.850
In our daily life, we have to adapt
to various scenarios and situations.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.686
People get injured,
people get sick, people call off work.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.813
-Someone's leaving.
-Yes.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.649
I'm gonna ask you
to part with one of your team members.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.401
-Dang it!
-Oh wow.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.988
-For the rest of the course.
-For the rest of the course?

15:06.071 --> 15:07.865
I'm gonna give you five minutes.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.409
Speak with your team
and come to a decision. Okay?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.244
-Yes, Chef.
-Thank you.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.997
-Nothing's personal.
-This is hard.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.459
-You can't go. You have to stay, for sure.
-You have to stay.

15:18.542 --> 15:22.755
I want you to tell me the truth.
If one of you would rather not be here,

15:22.838 --> 15:24.173
I want you to feel free to say,

15:24.256 --> 15:26.258
"You know what,
I would like to… I'll bow out."

15:26.342 --> 15:28.552
If you both wanna be here,
I wanna know that too.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.556
I mean, it's tough. I mean, I think
we both wanna be here to help you. Like…

15:32.640 --> 15:35.809
I mean, well,
realistically, you need Daniel.

15:36.393 --> 15:39.188
Um, Tyricia's working on the flower,
and I'm just a floater.

15:39.688 --> 15:43.192
So… the decision is yours.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.446
I want you to be most successful,
and I feel like you'll be most successful

15:47.529 --> 15:51.951
if you have Amanda with you versus myself.
Just because she's an instructor.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.120
-It's plain and simple. Yeah. It's fine.
-Thank you.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.498
Yeah.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.124
Juan, I know it's difficult,

15:59.208 --> 16:01.502
but who have you decided
to part with today?

16:01.585 --> 16:04.046
-It is really, really difficult.
-I know.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.091
And, uh, the person that I'm gonna…

16:09.802 --> 16:12.846
-Juan, you are within the time. It's okay.
-Yeah, sorry. I…

16:12.930 --> 16:16.058
No, it's okay.
You are team leader, things happen,

16:16.141 --> 16:19.019
you are fighting for your win.
So, who do you want to part with?

16:19.103 --> 16:20.729
-Tyricia.
-Tyricia. Okay.

16:22.856 --> 16:25.442
So, Tyricia, I'm gonna ask you
to stop what you're doing

16:25.526 --> 16:27.403
and step out from the desk.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.571
That was
one of the hardest decisions I've made.

16:29.655 --> 16:33.367
She has been there, like,
mentally supporting me from the beginning.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.077
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.954
But Cedrick was moving in such a speed.

16:37.037 --> 16:41.875
So, I had to make the decision of picking
the one who is, like, moving much faster.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.712
Goodbye, Tyricia.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.380
Don't say bye-bye.

16:46.463 --> 16:50.884
Like, Juan, it's okay.
It's not… It's not personal. It's not you.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.096
It's the GM, who is now Chef.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.516
Like, if your GM comes in the hotel,
"Gotta make cuts. Gotta fire people."

16:57.599 --> 16:58.517
It is what it is.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.814
When Stephanie said,
"You know what, I'll sit out,"

17:03.897 --> 17:07.693
it was the move of a very classy woman.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.487
It's okay.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.573
-Did you cry? I'm trying not to.
-No, I'm…

17:12.656 --> 17:14.825
I said, I'm trying not to.
Don't… don't look at me.

17:15.993 --> 17:19.121
-Amanda, you are now on mess duty as well.
-Okay.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.039
Thank you.

17:20.122 --> 17:23.500
Chefs, you are eight hours in
with eight hours to go.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.669
You're at the halfway point, okay, guys?

17:25.753 --> 17:28.338
-Thank you, Chef.
-Let's do this for Tyricia.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.757
Oh, Amanda.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.301
This is what my friends
call my dude strength.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.428
Don't talk to her
while she's holding that.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.097
This is like, uh, sabotage over there.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.515
-Unfair!

17:41.226 --> 17:42.519
-This good?
-Yes.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.980
Oh he went crazy.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.024
He went crazy!

17:48.442 --> 17:50.527
-Oh hell yeah.
-Oh my God, Thiago.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.613
The feet are so good!

17:53.238 --> 17:55.616
You went crazy.
Like, you're a tattoo artist.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.701
The eyes are so good!

18:01.246 --> 18:04.833
What I don't like about this base so far,
it's they all have the same diameter.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.045
I wish you would've done the wood lathe,
because it was much thinner.

18:08.128 --> 18:11.006
You have that very thin base
and then this big thing.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.551
It's never too late to cut here
and change the base, in case.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.890
-The problem is it's too square.
-What's that?

18:19.973 --> 18:21.850
The problem is
that it's too square.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.477
I think I know how to fix it.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.272
Mellisa has
the old-school mentality of the kitchen.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.190
She's laser-focused.

18:28.273 --> 18:32.236
She's been through a lot in her career.
She's somebody who's had to really fight

18:32.319 --> 18:33.278
to get to where she is.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.948
I like that she took herself
out of her comfort zone

18:36.031 --> 18:39.118
and really tried to… to sculpt something.
I wanna help her win.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.246
-This is looking way better.
-Yeah. Yep.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.623
-Don't be scared of it.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.669
-There you go. Have fun with it.
-No, wait. You're leaving already?

18:48.752 --> 18:49.628
I'm scared.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.714
He's scared. He can't be scared.
He'll never get it done.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.216
-Juan?
-Yeah.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.305
-Shut it off. Shut it off.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.182
-Ooh.
-Phew.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.227
-Where did that go?

19:05.310 --> 19:08.147
-It's on my table.
-Juan tried to take me out.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.773
-Totally.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.234
If you take her out, I will take Daniel.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.027
-Oh-ho.

19:14.111 --> 19:14.945
I'm so sorry.

19:15.028 --> 19:18.740
There is so much riding
on this one showpiece

19:18.824 --> 19:22.494
that you see Juan kind of
almost getting in his own head a lot.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.872
-Like, there's no room for error.
-All right.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.999
Biased that I am, I wanted Juan to win.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.919
-Look at the cheerleaders over there.
-Ready? Go team go!

19:31.003 --> 19:32.171
Go team!

19:32.254 --> 19:34.173
-Go team go!

19:34.256 --> 19:38.177
-Oh my God!
-Don't look at us.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.596
Aw, nice. Nice. And I love that, like,

19:40.679 --> 19:42.764
it's cutting a little bit
of the color off here,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.766
so it makes it even pop the vein more.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.269
-I've learned from the queen of shine.
-Good job.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.270
Team leaders?

19:49.021 --> 19:52.357
Juan, Mellisa, you have six hours left.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.777
I know you are missing
Tyricia and Stephanie.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.614
Unfortunately,
you're gonna have to part with

19:58.697 --> 20:00.699
one additional person from your team.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.159
I knew it. I knew it.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.286
I don't think
they were surprised, Chef.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.456
-They knew.
-Well, then it's better for them.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.959
I want them to prove
that, as chefs and leaders,

20:11.043 --> 20:13.545
they can overcome any scenario.

20:13.629 --> 20:16.715
I'll polish as fast as I can
before I go.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.634
-Thank you, Cedrick.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.011
Mellisa, who is leaving the team?

20:21.094 --> 20:22.221
Amanda.

20:22.304 --> 20:26.683
Amanda, I'm gonna ask you to drop the egg
and join Tyricia and Stephanie.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.186
-Thank you, Chef.
-Thank you, Amanda.

20:29.269 --> 20:32.564
-No, sweetheart!
-Don't cry. It's okay.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.899
It's not for me.

20:33.982 --> 20:37.694
-It's just, like, a lot.
-I'm just emotional.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.988
Don't wanna look at you.
Gonna start crying too.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.448
I know, right?

20:41.531 --> 20:44.368
-Thanks. Three more leaves left.
-Thanks so much for everything.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.452
You have three more.

20:45.535 --> 20:49.248
Just for you to know, at some point,
you will finish this competition alone.

20:49.831 --> 20:50.916
Yes, Chef.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.254
So, in my mind, I'm reanalyzing

20:55.337 --> 20:57.756
and made some decisions
right then and there

20:57.839 --> 20:59.758
about what I was going to change.

20:59.841 --> 21:04.721
I was gonna make these elaborate
3D acrylic branches coming up.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.517
Instead, I'll just do a quick laminate.
So yeah, there was some adaption.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.936
Just gently luster them
with a little green.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.646
Gonna finish this in the next 15.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.899
Yes. Let's finish that,
and then we're gonna work together.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.860
At the end of day, it's gonna end up
between me and Mellisa, and that's it.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.071
And with the time that we have,

21:21.154 --> 21:23.532
Daniel and I,
we're just jamming everything.

21:23.615 --> 21:27.286
We still have to start assembling things.
We still have to put the bird on it.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.121
-All righty.
-Breathe.

21:29.204 --> 21:30.330
-Yeah.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.208
Chefs, you have three hours
to finish your showpieces.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.418
Yes, Chef.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.673
Yes. Done.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.933
I'll pick this up,
you heat the bottom, and I'll put it on.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.101
Yep. Good.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.228
-Tell me where.
-Yep. There.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.355
-Good.
-Watch your finger.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.566
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-You good?

21:57.649 --> 21:59.985
-Liquid.
-Just guide me with the ladder.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.487
Wait. Forward, forward, forward.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.073
Look how tall their piece is now.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.368
-Danny, I'm kind of, like, scared.
-What do you wanna do?

22:08.452 --> 22:10.495
It's… You see the… the…

22:12.039 --> 22:14.249
-You see how it wobbles?
-Mm-hmm.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.084
I think we should just cut the head.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.503
-Chef, it's your piece.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.797
The body, it was too big for the base.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.800
It's definitely not gonna work.
It's gonna be imbalanced.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.720
-Moving that thing, it's gonna break.
-You tell me, Chef.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.892
Cut as close as here possible.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.478
-Here? Right here?
-Mm-hmm. Correct.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.313
-Yes? <i>Oui.</i> Okay.
-I'm sure.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.744
-Ooh. Short.
-What are you at?

22:50.827 --> 22:52.579
-How short?
-Short.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.041
As soon as I lost Amanda,
I knew I had a height problem.

22:56.124 --> 22:59.920
Because the greenery that I was gonna make
was supposed to be coming up there.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.714
-Do you think this guy could go up here?
-Which one?

23:04.132 --> 23:04.966
Up there?

23:05.801 --> 23:06.927
Yes…

23:07.010 --> 23:10.347
I truly believe the key to managing people

23:10.430 --> 23:14.351
is you get people to do what you want them
to do and make them think it's their idea.

23:14.434 --> 23:17.729
-Leave that up there?
-It's pretty cute. Let's do it.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.776
-Let's go. Let's put it up there.
-He's up there.

23:22.859 --> 23:26.488
-We are definitely at four feet now.
-Uh, yeah.

23:26.571 --> 23:30.325
-Chefs, you have two hours remaining. Two.
-Thank you, Chef.

23:31.868 --> 23:32.911
Am I on?

23:32.994 --> 23:35.372
Yep.
Don't move. Gonna get cold spray.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.165
-I'm putting him down.
-Go ahead.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.376
To your right. No, no. That's your left.

23:39.876 --> 23:40.877
You're good.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.754
Yep, yep, yep. Okay.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.424
Go.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.135
-Let's do actually this one.
-Yeah.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.053
And then we can actually rest it.

23:51.680 --> 23:56.101
Juan, Mellisa, you're gonna have one hour
to finish your piece alone.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.144
Yes, Chef.

23:57.644 --> 24:00.856
Daniel, Thiago, please step out.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.732
-Yes, Chef.
-Keep killing, Mel.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.109
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.445
-See you in a few.
-Yep. Crush it. Push.

24:07.571 --> 24:08.738
Push, push, push, push.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.033
Good job, dude.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.869
-Yeah. Good job.
-Looks nice.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.079
So much can be done in one hour, guys.

24:17.080 --> 24:17.998
Interesting.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.333
-You guys did a great job.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.377
Thiago died.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.964
Looks great, Mellisa.
Love it. Love, love, love it.

24:26.965 --> 24:31.845
I want to walk out of here and say
that I gave it everything that I could,

24:31.928 --> 24:35.765
I brought all the passion, the ideas,

24:35.849 --> 24:38.643
I left it all out here,
and I have no regret.

24:38.727 --> 24:43.023
And then it's up to Chef
whose life they're gonna change.

24:43.607 --> 24:47.194
I think it's good that she's looking
for every flaw before she covers it up.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.236
Yeah.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.739
I know you're cleaning it up
'cause you're happy.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.743
She was creating
a beautiful showpiece.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.079
It was absolutely frightening.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.665
It got in my head.
I mean, I was looking at that,

25:00.749 --> 25:02.083
and it was like, wow.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.212
The way that she did it
was in such a clean way

25:05.295 --> 25:07.172
that I was just really scared.

25:07.255 --> 25:09.257
That dew is so beautiful.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.009
-The what?
-The dew.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.595
-Your dew. Your droplets.
-Thank you.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.348
He probably doesn't get,
you know… He's from Colombia.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.019
-One minute.
-One minute.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.729
Sometimes less is more.
I like it.

25:22.812 --> 25:25.524
You're, like,
queen of dragons, Mellisa.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.193
-Queen of dinosaurs.
-Queen of dinosaurs.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.611
[exciting music playing

25:36.660 --> 25:38.537
You did a great job, Juan.
A great job.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.829
<i>We</i> did a great job.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.500
Time is up. Exercise is over.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.418
Yay!

25:48.046 --> 25:52.050
Chefs, I'm gonna ask you
to bring your showpieces forward.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.761
Three, two, one.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.099
On the ledge. On the edge.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.393
-You got it. Okay.
-Whoa, whoa.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.769
-Gently.
-Hold the neck.

26:02.852 --> 26:03.979
<i>Oui.</i> I'm holding the neck.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.772
-Slow it down.
-Slow down.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.232
Let's go down.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.193
Hey, good job, guys.

26:11.945 --> 26:14.531
-That was nerve-racking.
-Oh my God.

26:14.614 --> 26:15.907
I'm so glad I trust myself.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.952
I can guarantee if we had not cut that,
it would've fallen.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.328
The whole thing would just… boop.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.914
-Nice job, Juan.
-Good job. Beautiful.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.756
Chefs, during this last challenge,

26:31.840 --> 26:36.428
you all outdone yourselves in a major way,
and I wanted to congratulate you.

26:36.511 --> 26:39.222
-You can be really proud of yourselves.
-Thank you, Chef.

26:39.889 --> 26:41.391
This was a great class.

26:41.474 --> 26:44.936
I could see personal
and professional growth and improvement.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.646
I hope you feel that way as well.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.774
And at the end,
we had our two top students

26:49.858 --> 26:53.069
going head-to-head
on the chocolate showpiece exercise.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.739
Juan and Mellisa, please step forward.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.581
Juan,
what were you trying to achieve?

27:04.664 --> 27:06.708
Me, when I think of prehistoric,

27:06.791 --> 27:10.378
I think of, uh, color,
I think big flowers, big leaves,

27:10.462 --> 27:12.380
and I also think of, like, the cavemen,

27:12.464 --> 27:15.383
how they were also so scared,
always being in the caves.

27:15.467 --> 27:19.346
And then, for me,
putting the dinosaur on top

27:19.429 --> 27:23.683
is a representation of sometimes
it's better just to get out of that cave

27:23.767 --> 27:25.310
and explore and evolve.

27:25.393 --> 27:27.187
And that's why we have
this type of dinosaur,

27:27.270 --> 27:30.273
because it's an evolving dinosaur,
from a dinosaur to a bird.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.568
That's why the wings are so small,
and he actually cannot fly.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.613
I couldn't have done it
without the three of them.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.448
It was a team-effort piece.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.536
I have a good emotion when I look at it.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.955
What I love the most is this balance.

27:46.039 --> 27:49.292
You start with a base being very thin.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.544
With that much height and elegance,

27:52.045 --> 27:56.591
you are proving
that you understand strength of chocolate.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.845
It's a real chocolatier approach
to what a showpiece should be.

28:01.471 --> 28:03.765
At first, when I saw those disks,
I'm like,

28:03.848 --> 28:05.934
"Oh no, no. That's not what he wanted."

28:06.017 --> 28:12.857
You turned a design I have to say I hated
into something I actually like.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.653
The color combinations are very nice.

28:16.736 --> 28:19.989
The little sugar droplets, great.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.909
You start to put one, and two, and three,

28:22.992 --> 28:25.370
and then I have dew drops,
dew drops, dew drops.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.457
Also, when you're on the flat leaf,
this makes a lot of sense.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.876
-Right now, it's raining, right? Almost.
-Mm-hmm.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.629
Because, otherwise,
you cannot have, like, a perfect…

28:34.713 --> 28:38.049
-If I drop it, then twist it, so it looks…
-Maybe.

28:38.133 --> 28:41.302
Or using it only on parts
that are horizontal.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.888
Good job on the sculpting.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.809
You took massive risk by cutting the head.

28:47.892 --> 28:48.977
-Yeah.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.771
But I was all for it,
because I agreed with you.

28:51.855 --> 28:56.401
At first I thought that some of the leaves
would be hiding too much the neck area,

28:56.484 --> 28:59.779
and then it created some kind
of very green environment.

28:59.863 --> 29:04.033
From a perspective of someone
who wants to look at a prehistoric piece,

29:04.117 --> 29:06.995
I am in that wild prehistorical jungle.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.705
So you hit the mark on that.

29:08.788 --> 29:11.833
-The Colombian jungle.
-The Colombian jungle. Perfect.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.795
However, cleanliness.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.213
I see broken leaves.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.424
I see broken feathers.

29:20.049 --> 29:24.262
I don't have to look too deep
to see that things were rushed

29:24.345 --> 29:25.680
at the last minute.

29:29.058 --> 29:29.893
Ramen noodles?

29:31.352 --> 29:33.021
-What's going on?
-It's eating.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.440
-Eating what? The base?
-Yes.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.650
All right.
I did not see it at first.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.653
And he knows how to use chopsticks, right?

29:41.654 --> 29:45.158
-He's a pretty advanced, uh, dinosaur.
-He put it…

29:45.241 --> 29:48.244
I am being harsh, okay?
But this is unbelievable,

29:48.328 --> 29:49.996
to be really honest.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.956
You really listen, and I can tell that,

29:52.040 --> 29:55.001
even though you came here
with strong knowledge on chocolate,

29:55.084 --> 29:57.003
you grew from this experience,
so for me, it's a win.

29:57.086 --> 29:57.921
A lot.

29:58.004 --> 30:00.340
-Thank you so much, Chef.
-Thank you, Juan.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.841
Thank you, guys.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.595
Mmm.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.473
Mellisa,
can you tell the whole class

30:08.556 --> 30:09.974
what you're presenting today?

30:10.058 --> 30:14.187
So much of the prehistoric story
is actually death, right? And fossils.

30:14.270 --> 30:17.732
So, I really wanted
to work that element in as well,

30:17.816 --> 30:19.567
and it just kind of came alive

30:19.651 --> 30:21.694
with the idea of doing the little babies

30:21.778 --> 30:24.113
with the eggs on top of a fossil,

30:24.197 --> 30:25.532
and this is…

30:27.742 --> 30:29.118
…the piece.

30:29.702 --> 30:32.288
You… you really delivered
something very solid.

30:32.372 --> 30:36.751
Each and every one of the element,
they are crafted to perfection.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.964
Not to take anything away from you,
but I have to say, little plus Thiago.

30:41.047 --> 30:44.509
-The baby T. rex, it's fantastic.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.345
-You really… you really have it.

30:47.428 --> 30:49.472
A sign of a good leader
is trust your team,

30:49.556 --> 30:52.934
and for her to trust me to do these guys,
you know, for her big finale,

30:53.017 --> 30:55.061
it's… it shows
what kind of a leader she is,

30:55.144 --> 30:56.855
so I really appreciate that.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.149
I was very fortunate
to have an amazing team. Yeah.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.361
I like the color.

31:03.444 --> 31:04.863
It's less bright,

31:04.946 --> 31:07.949
but the dinos bring so much of that light.

31:08.032 --> 31:11.035
Love the little mushroom.
Love the placement.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.873
I would have loved for you
to show me heat gun and shine.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.749
You make those eggs shiny,

31:16.833 --> 31:18.251
and it's a big win.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.919
Because, right now, it's…

31:20.003 --> 31:21.588
aside from the mushroom,

31:21.671 --> 31:23.506
it's all the same texture.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.466
I really like the little…

31:25.550 --> 31:27.427
the… the multiple shadow on the hand.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.972
I can tell that time, you know, went by.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.849
The leaves, not a big fan,

31:32.932 --> 31:37.896
because everything you did
was so realistic-looking and so detailed

31:37.979 --> 31:39.939
that doing a very modern approach

31:40.023 --> 31:43.109
does not coincide
with the beauty of the whole piece.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.152
Yeah. I agree.

31:45.278 --> 31:48.448
The base, I have to say,
I've never seen this before.

31:48.531 --> 31:53.536
I think it's a clever way of maybe
being less confident about sculpting,

31:53.620 --> 31:55.955
yet still sculpting, and it's great.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.375
But, in my opinion, the biggest flaw,

31:59.459 --> 32:05.715
it's how massive
this beautiful yet massive base is,

32:05.798 --> 32:07.926
compared to the rest of the piece.

32:08.009 --> 32:08.843
Yeah.

32:08.927 --> 32:13.139
I believe that if you would've been able
to do this guy narrow,

32:13.222 --> 32:15.016
it would have been a hit.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.559
I agree. 100%.

32:16.643 --> 32:19.729
However, the thing
that strikes me with this piece,

32:20.229 --> 32:24.108
it's how impeccable
everything is glued on.

32:24.192 --> 32:27.236
-There is no fingerprints.

32:27.320 --> 32:33.910
I cannot see any gluing point,
which is incredible. It's extremely rare.

32:33.993 --> 32:38.081
You came here with a little bit less
chocolate knowledge,

32:38.164 --> 32:39.916
coming from a restaurant business.

32:39.999 --> 32:42.794
-You don't get to do this a lot.
-No. No.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.838
You acquired knowledge.
You used the knowledge

32:45.922 --> 32:48.299
of your team as well very wisely.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.009
And you are delivering something

32:50.093 --> 32:53.096
that is very new

32:53.972 --> 32:55.640
to the world of chocolate.

32:55.723 --> 32:58.226
It's a very new approach,
and I really appreciate it.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.269
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Chef.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.148
Mmm.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.527
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-Of course.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.156
Oh.

33:13.032 --> 33:14.909
-Good job.
-Sorry. Yeah, you too.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.036
Class, it's time for last check-in.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.038
-Stephanie?
-Hi.

33:19.122 --> 33:22.625
-Tell me about your experience.
-I'm really emotional.

33:23.960 --> 33:28.089
I've gotten to prove to myself
what I'm capable of, things I didn't know,

33:28.172 --> 33:31.092
and Mellisa has been a huge part of that.
Being able to be on her team,

33:31.175 --> 33:35.805
I was happy to see her succeed and show
how talented she is with this piece today.

33:35.888 --> 33:40.977
I think she really utilized our skills
the best way she could have. Yeah.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.979
-Thiago.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.898
School for me is something
that, this was the first time, so…

33:45.982 --> 33:48.192
I've never been a good student,
so that… that shows.

33:48.276 --> 33:53.197
Um, but I learned invaluable amount
of knowledge here. It's been amazing.

33:53.781 --> 33:54.782
Amanda.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.411
It's been a roller coaster ride, Chef.
From start to finish.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.121
-I believe you.
-It's been amazing.

34:00.204 --> 34:04.375
-Are you leaving today with a fulfillment?
-Absolutely. It's been an honor.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.086
-Cedrick. Are you gonna show me emotion?
-Yes, Chef?

34:07.170 --> 34:08.379
-Yes.
-What's inside?

34:08.463 --> 34:11.007
-Feelings! Um…

34:12.508 --> 34:15.803
My hope was to get a better,
um, understanding

34:15.887 --> 34:18.556
and appreciation
for working with chocolate.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.601
And I got what I wanted out of it.
I'm… I'm excited for chocolate.

34:21.684 --> 34:26.481
I wanna get back to my kitchen
and start to create my own showpieces.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.274
Good. I'm happy.

34:29.317 --> 34:30.443
Daniel.

34:30.526 --> 34:32.904
Every one little technique
you've been able to bring up,

34:32.987 --> 34:35.907
I'm like, "Wow. Oh my gosh.
I've never thought of that." Now I'm like…

34:35.990 --> 34:37.241
It's just…

34:37.325 --> 34:38.451
I've learned a lot.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.245
And I'm very appreciative
and happy that I'm here.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.873
-You are a diamond in the rough.
-Yes, Chef.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.541
Tyricia.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.627
You're gonna get
all the emotions out of me,

34:47.710 --> 34:50.546
because, I don't know,
it just built up all the way over here.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.090
I'm just fully emotions, Chef.

34:52.173 --> 34:55.301
Before you go on, because I know
I won't be able to speak, right?

34:57.970 --> 35:01.891
If I had a best improvement award to give,
it would be yours.

35:01.974 --> 35:06.354
You were able to be a sponge,
and you took note of every single thing.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.689
It was so rewarding for me as a teacher.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.691
I did just come here to take…

35:11.734 --> 35:12.735
Jesus.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.738
-It's all right.
-Breathe. Yeah, breathe.

35:17.698 --> 35:21.285
I… I just came in,
Chef, to take in… to <i>be</i> a sponge.

35:21.369 --> 35:27.792
I mean, um, you don't get this chance
in the industry to learn <i>and</i> grow.

35:27.875 --> 35:31.045
To come here,
my thing was just to take it all in.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.171
And you did.

35:32.755 --> 35:33.631
Thank you, Chef.

35:35.174 --> 35:37.426
Juan, tell me
about your experience with us.

35:37.510 --> 35:43.599
This experience has been amazing.
I think it's one of the biggest marathons

35:43.683 --> 35:45.935
I ever done in my life,
and I don't even go to the gym.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.564
It really helped me
to believe in myself.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.440
It helped me to push myself

35:51.524 --> 35:55.194
to know what you have and just go for it.
So, thank you so much for that.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.529
Cool. Mellisa.

35:56.612 --> 35:59.782
I don't normally like
to put myself in situations

35:59.866 --> 36:02.827
where you can fail miserably,

36:02.910 --> 36:07.165
and I have noticed in… in the past,
like, pulling back a little bit in fear,

36:07.248 --> 36:08.583
and when I came here,

36:08.666 --> 36:11.419
I told myself that that is one thing
that I have to cure.

36:11.502 --> 36:16.424
So from the flashlight where I thought,
"I have made a massive mistake,"

36:16.507 --> 36:19.844
to now being here has been, um,

36:20.511 --> 36:21.762
exceptionally rewarding.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.932
Time of my life, actually. You know,
it's been really, really, really, fun.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.101
And you did not embarrass yourself.
Trust me.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.020
Okay.

36:29.103 --> 36:31.105
You all did
an amazing job this week.

36:31.772 --> 36:33.357
Let's talk about our awards.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.401
-Carolyn, join me, please?
-Yes, Chef.

36:35.484 --> 36:36.319
Thank you.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.324
This first envelope

36:42.950 --> 36:46.954
is the official invitation
to my pastry academy in Las Vegas,

36:47.038 --> 36:49.165
to teach an international master class.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.503
The second envelope is a check for $50,000

36:55.504 --> 36:58.591
to help you kick off your next pastry
and chocolate adventure.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.885
-Intense moment.

37:02.011 --> 37:04.889
The third envelope,
this one, you didn't know about it,

37:05.473 --> 37:09.852
is an official invitation
for the Charleston Wine and Food Festival,

37:09.936 --> 37:12.605
where you will participate
in one of their marquee events.

37:12.688 --> 37:16.192
They will help curate your experience
during this five-day festival.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.985
Cool latest addition.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.737
And our last envelope…

37:19.820 --> 37:21.572
Alicia, please join me.

37:21.656 --> 37:25.076
She's the West Coast corporate pastry chef
for Cacao Barry.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.495
Uh, what Cacao Barry would like to do

37:27.578 --> 37:31.499
is award you
with an exclusive one-on-one session

37:31.582 --> 37:35.544
with our globally recognized chefs
in our state-of-the-art facility.

37:35.628 --> 37:36.671
But that's not all.

37:37.255 --> 37:43.219
You will be the architect of 500 pounds
of your own signature chocolate.

37:43.302 --> 37:47.682
-It's a great last addition, right?

37:48.516 --> 37:50.268
It would be life-changing to win

37:50.351 --> 37:52.770
for me, who wants
to start my own chocolate business.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.314
I could pay for my licensing.
I could get my rent.

37:55.398 --> 37:58.693
You're actually setting yourself up
for success to start a small business,

37:58.776 --> 38:00.653
which is <i>amazing.</i>

38:01.362 --> 38:06.117
All of these awards
constitute a total value of $100,000.

38:09.328 --> 38:12.623
I mean, definitely,
having that prize is gonna change my life.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.584
That's gonna make my dreams come true.
It's gonna…

38:15.668 --> 38:19.714
It's… it's gonna make so much for me
that I can't wait. I… I'd really wanna…

38:19.797 --> 38:22.550
Just, like, crown me already.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.969
I'm going to be really honest with you.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.513
You know I don't like to sugarcoat things.

38:27.596 --> 38:28.848
Those two pieces

38:30.349 --> 38:33.602
easily have the level
for an entry-level world competition.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.313
No joke.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.273
This is outstanding job.

38:38.649 --> 38:43.654
Mellisa, you bring something so new.
A little bit bottom-heavy.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.866
Juan, this is something
very narrow and elegant,

38:46.949 --> 38:49.869
yet a little bit more traditional
to the chocolatier approach.

38:51.203 --> 38:54.123
You are asking me
to compare apples and oranges.

38:58.669 --> 39:01.422
Tonight, we're going to name
our best in class…

39:04.884 --> 39:05.801
and that person is…

39:10.639 --> 39:11.640
Juan!

39:15.394 --> 39:17.855
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much, Chef.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.774
-Congratulations, Mellisa.
-Thank you.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.108
Nice job.

39:23.235 --> 39:24.070
Ah!

39:25.488 --> 39:27.031
So crazy.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.658
Hey. Be proud, okay?

39:31.160 --> 39:32.620
Definitely a dream come true.

39:32.703 --> 39:36.165
My mom is… She's…Right now,
there is a party up there in heaven.

39:36.248 --> 39:39.585
Mom, this one is for you.
And for my dad too. For both of them.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.048
Thanks
for all your hard work.

39:44.131 --> 39:45.633
Thank you so much.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.551
-Thank you.
-Appreciate you, ladies.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.303
I didn't win, but I'm proud

39:49.387 --> 39:53.224
because I stepped outside of a lot
of different things I'm comfortable with,

39:53.307 --> 39:58.020
and I took some big risks,
and I'm still stoked that I did that,

39:58.104 --> 40:03.150
because I really try hard
not to let fear get in the way of things.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.569
-Great job.
-Thank you.

40:05.653 --> 40:10.574
I think I'll always attribute
that kind of growth to Amaury, for sure.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.702
-Ooh! Hey.
-Give us a warning<i>,</i> jeez.

40:13.786 --> 40:17.289
And this concludes
the first <i>School of Chocolate</i>.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.499
<i>Oui.</i>
-<i>Salud.</i>

40:18.582 --> 40:20.459
-Yes, Chef.
-Cheers, you guys.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.336
Does it mean
I actually graduated, or…
