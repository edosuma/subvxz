09:56.208 --> 09:58.000
- SHE AIN'T GONNA NEED
A WORKPLACE MUCH LONGER.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.250
- YEAH, SOON, SHE'LL HAVE
HER SERVANTS

09:59.250 --> 10:01.084
BRINGING HER COFFEE
OUT OF A SILVER CHALICE.

10:01.084 --> 10:02.792
[laughter]
- OKAY, COME ON NOW, STOP.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.209
- OH.
- NO, SERIOUSLY, KEEP GOING.

10:04.209 --> 10:05.250
[laughter]

10:05.250 --> 10:07.708
[overlapping chatter]

10:11.708 --> 10:13.792
- MORNING, MANDY.

10:13.792 --> 10:16.084
- WHY DOES LIP GIVE A FUCK
WHETHER THAT BITCH KAREN

10:16.084 --> 10:17.166
IS ALIVE OR DEAD?

10:17.166 --> 10:20.875
- IT'S A MYSTERY.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.041
- WHAT WAS ALL THAT
ABOUT?

10:26.041 --> 10:29.000
- YOU, KAREN,
THE UNFATHOMABLE MALE SOUL.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.834
- [laughs]
WHY AREN'T YOU IN SCHOOL?

10:30.834 --> 10:32.291
- SKIPPING.

10:32.291 --> 10:35.125
- DEBS, WE NEED AT LEAST
ONE PERSON IN THIS FAMILY

10:35.125 --> 10:37.417
TO NOT TURN CYNICAL,
AND MY MONEY'S BEEN ON YOU.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.625
- I MADE SOUP
FOR SHEILA.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.625
- THAT'S NICE.
I'M GONNA DROP BY THE HOSPITAL.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.167
I'LL TAKE IT FOR YOU.

10:43.167 --> 10:45.084
- AND TAKE THE CREDIT
FOR DOING SOMETHING NICE

10:45.084 --> 10:47.000
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DID NOTHING?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.750
- WELL, TO BE FAIR,
AT THAT POINT,

10:48.750 --> 10:51.125
I WILL HAVE CARRIED IT
ALL THE WAY OVER THERE, SO--

10:51.125 --> 10:55.208
- YOU'RE TAKING MANDY
FOR GRANTED.

10:55.208 --> 10:56.625
- WHY?
WHAT'D SHE TELL YOU?

10:56.625 --> 10:58.750
- SHE'S KIND,
SHE'S DEVOTED,

10:58.750 --> 11:01.084
SHE'S NOT SOMEONE
WHOSE FEELINGS YOU CAN IGNORE,

11:01.084 --> 11:02.583
SO STOP BEING
A DOPE,

11:02.583 --> 11:06.209
AND PUT HER FEELINGS FIRST
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

11:06.209 --> 11:10.084
- SCHOOL IS A TIME TO EXPERIMENT
WITH YOUR MINDS

11:10.084 --> 11:12.375
AND WITH YOUR GENITALIA.

11:12.375 --> 11:17.125
NOW, THE HUMAN GENITALIA, TO ME,
IS LIKE A HOMING DEVICE--

11:17.125 --> 11:19.875
GOD'S COMPASS.
HUH?

11:19.875 --> 11:22.458
AND EACH OF US HAS IT,

11:22.458 --> 11:26.166
AND IT GUIDES US
TO OUR DESTINED HOMES.

11:26.166 --> 11:30.083
NOW, OUR DEVICES DON'T WORK
IF WE TRY TO POINT 'EM

11:30.083 --> 11:32.209
IN A DIRECTION THAT THEY
DON'T WANT TO GO IN. [laughs]

11:32.209 --> 11:34.084
- HE NEEDS TO TONE IT DOWN,
PLEASE.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.166
- BUT, YOU KNOW,
I LAUGH FOR A POINT,

11:35.166 --> 11:37.375
BECAUSE LET PEOPLE
CHOW DOWN

11:37.375 --> 11:39.875
ON THE NETHER REGION
OF THEIR CHOICE--

11:39.875 --> 11:43.959
MALE, FEMALE,
CONSENTING ANIMAL.

11:43.959 --> 11:46.083
- STOP--UH...
[laughs]

11:46.083 --> 11:48.250
MASON PREPARATORY ACADEMY,
THANK YOU SO MUCH...

11:48.250 --> 11:49.834
- THANK YOU.
- FOR HEARING OUR STORY.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.250
[claps]
- THANK YOU. YOU'RE TERRIFIC.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.250
- YOU GUYS ARE TERRIFIC.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.250
- I--I'M SORRY. IT'S--I CAN'T--
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

11:55.250 --> 11:58.167
- IT'S THE HOTEL.
I NEED A MINI-FRIDGE.

11:58.167 --> 11:59.667
I NEED A HOT PLATE
AT THE VERY LEAST.

11:59.667 --> 12:00.959
- I TRIED TO TAKE A NAP...
- EXCUSE ME?

12:00.959 --> 12:02.250
- AND I CAN'T--
- EXCUSE ME,

12:02.250 --> 12:05.125
THAT WAS THE MOST HONEST SPEECH
I'VE EVER HEARD.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.542
I JUST TEXTED MY DAD,
AND HE TOLD ME

12:06.542 --> 12:08.542
I COULD DONATE $1,000
TO THE CAUSE.

12:08.542 --> 12:11.125
UM, WHO DO I
MAKE THE CHECK OUT TO?

12:11.125 --> 12:12.875
- "THE CERTITUDE COMMISSION."

12:12.875 --> 12:15.084
- OKAY. "CERT"--
OKAY.

12:18.917 --> 12:21.166
[respirator]

12:26.375 --> 12:29.375
- KILL THE PHENOBARBITAL
AND PARALYTICS.

12:31.875 --> 12:33.458
- EXCUSE ME.

12:33.458 --> 12:36.500
EXCUSE ME, HI. I'M SORRY.
I KNOW--GOOD MORNING.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.000
- [chuckles]
- I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY BUSY,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
BUT WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU "KILLING"?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.250
- THE SWELLING APPEARS TO HAVE
GONE DOWN IN HER BRAIN,

12:42.250 --> 12:44.250
SO I'M KILLING THE MEDS
THAT INDUCE THE COMA.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.917
- OH, OKAY.
EXCUSE ME.

12:45.917 --> 12:47.834
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:47.834 --> 12:49.125
- I'M REMOVING
SOME OF HER MEDS.

12:49.125 --> 12:52.834
- OKAY. N--I'M SORRY--
- HEY!

12:52.834 --> 12:54.750
- YES?
- I'M A NICE GUY.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.959
PATIENT, NOT USUALLY
A VIOLENT DUDE,

12:56.959 --> 12:59.417
BUT IF YOU TRY TO LEAVE HERE
ONE MORE TIME

12:59.417 --> 13:00.708
WITHOUT TELLING US
WHAT'S GOING ON

13:00.708 --> 13:02.167
IN WORDS
WE CAN UNDERSTAND,

13:02.167 --> 13:04.167
I WILL YOUR LIFT
YOUR TINY BODY OVER MY HEAD

13:04.167 --> 13:07.208
AND THROW YOU
OUT THE WINDOW.

13:07.208 --> 13:10.667
- YOUR WIFE HAS SUSTAINED
SERIOUS TRAUMA TO HER BRAIN.

13:10.667 --> 13:14.000
- SO YOU SAID
THAT YOU'RE REMOVING

13:14.000 --> 13:16.209
THE MEDS
THAT INDUCE THE COMA.

13:16.209 --> 13:18.209
DOES THAT MEAN
SHE'S GONNA WAKE UP SOON?

13:18.209 --> 13:19.250
- THAT IS
ONE POSSIBILITY.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.583
- WHAT ARE
THE OTHER POSSIBILITIES?

13:20.583 --> 13:22.000
- THAT SHE WON'T
WAKE UP SOON,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.708
OR THAT SHE WON'T
WAKE UP EVER.

13:23.708 --> 13:25.792
- BUT IF SHE DOES WAKE UP,
WILL SHE BE OKAY?

13:25.792 --> 13:29.834
- WE WON'T KNOW HOW MUCH DAMAGE
THERE IS UNTIL SHE WAKES.

13:29.834 --> 13:32.000
- WELL, CAN WE HELP HER
WAKE UP?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.250
IS SHE--CAN SHE HEAR US
IN THERE?

13:34.250 --> 13:36.375
- NOBODY KNOWS,

13:36.375 --> 13:38.375
AND I DON'T WANT TO GET MYSELF
THROWN OUT THE WINDOW.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.417
- [mouthing words]

13:40.417 --> 13:42.083
SWEETIE?

13:42.083 --> 13:44.708
TIME TO WAKE UP.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.084
- BACON, LETTUCE, AND TOMATO
ON WHITE,

13:49.084 --> 13:51.834
JUST LIKE
YOUR OTHER FAVORITE MEAT.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.042
REALLY, NOTHING? I'VE BEEN
BREWING THAT LINE FOR WEEKS.

13:56.042 --> 13:57.959
- MOM'S PERIOD DAY
IS TOMORROW.

13:57.959 --> 13:59.667
- OH.
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

13:59.667 --> 14:01.875
- AH, COME ON, "V," I ONLY GOT
SO MUCH IN THE HARD DRIVE.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.583
REMEMBERING
YOUR MOM'S MENSTRUAL CYCLE

14:03.583 --> 14:05.000
IS NOT A TOP PRIORITY.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
WANT ME TO GO TO WALGREEN'S,
GET A PEE STICK?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.667
- HONESTLY?
- NO, NO, LIE TO ME.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.042
I HEAR
IT MAKES MARRIAGES THRIVE.

14:11.042 --> 14:13.209
EAT.

14:13.209 --> 14:16.084
I'LL GET A PEE STICK,
WE'LL CALL YOUR MOM,

14:16.084 --> 14:20.542
AND WE'LL WATCH HER TAKE A PISS.
IT'LL BE FUN.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.792
- MICKEY GETTING MARRIED,
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

14:24.792 --> 14:26.333
- WHAT SENSE
NEEDS TO BE MADE?

14:26.333 --> 14:28.875
SOMEONE'S PREGNANT,
SOMEONE GOT THEM PREGNANT,

14:28.875 --> 14:31.875
AND THAT'S...
WHY MARRIAGE WAS INVENTED.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.583
- THEY BEEN
GOING OUT LONG?

14:35.583 --> 14:39.250
- WHO KNOWS, I WASN'T IN
ON THE COURTING, OR THE FUCKING.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.917
- SO WHERE
DID THEY MEET?

14:40.917 --> 14:43.000
- SHE WOS
AT GARDEN SPRINGS SPA,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.875
IF YOU CALL JERKING OFF
RANDOM DUDES WORKING.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.250
- SHE PRETTY?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.834
- ON THE DEAD-EYED
RUSSIAN HAND-WHORE SCALE?

14:49.834 --> 14:53.208
I'D SAY SHE'D RATE
ABOUT A SEVEN.

14:53.208 --> 14:54.625
- [laughs]
- [child squeals]

14:54.625 --> 14:56.041
- CHOO, CHOO.

14:56.041 --> 14:58.417
- BOOM!

14:58.417 --> 15:02.333
- YOU HAVE SWEET AND LOW?
- I DO NOT.

15:02.333 --> 15:05.375
- IT'S OKAY.
I ALWAYS KEEP SOME IN MY WALLET.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.959
JUST HAVE TO REPLACE
THIS ONE.

15:07.959 --> 15:11.125
I FEEL SO HONORED TO BE INVITED
TO YOUR MISTRESS' PORCH.

15:11.125 --> 15:14.333
WHEN WILL YOU INVITE ME INSIDE
FOR SCONES?

15:14.333 --> 15:16.125
- NO TIME SOON.
LISTEN,

15:16.125 --> 15:18.000
I'M THINKING ABOUT TAKING
A LITTLE VACATION TO MICHIGAN.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.458
- I HOPE IT'S NOT TO COMMANDEER
A SHIPMENT OF CARS.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.166
- I'M THINKING OF GOING
BACK TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

15:23.166 --> 15:24.834
- [laughs]
IN MICHIGAN?

15:24.834 --> 15:27.167
- I QUIT BEFORE I COULD FINISH,
AND I ONLY HAVE

15:27.167 --> 15:28.625
A COUPLE OF SEMESTERS LEFT
TO GET MY DEGREE,

15:28.625 --> 15:30.667
SO--
- SO NOT A VACATION?

15:30.667 --> 15:33.000
- NOT EXACTLY, NO.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.875
- SO WHY THE STEP-STUTTER?
WHY NOT TELL ME THAT

15:34.875 --> 15:36.708
FROM THE BEGINNING?
- IT'S "STUTTER-STEP," OKAY?

15:36.708 --> 15:38.250
I WAS TESTING
THE WATERS FIRST.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.125
IT'S GOOD FOR ME,
AND FOR YOU.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.834
I'LL BE KEEPING OUT OF TROUBLE,
KEEPING MY NOSE CLEAN.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.125
- IN MICHIGAN?

15:44.125 --> 15:45.500
- YES.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.042
I MEAN, WE CAN GO UP THERE,
DRIVE AROUND.

15:48.042 --> 15:50.625
I MEAN, GREAT FOOD.
EXCELLENT CHEESE. TRUTH.

15:50.625 --> 15:52.000
- GOOD LUCK
CONVINCING HER TO MOVE.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
- FIONA?
- ESTEFANIA, [foreign word],

15:54.000 --> 15:55.875
YOUR WIFE!

15:55.875 --> 15:59.000
[speaking in Portuguese]

15:59.000 --> 16:00.667
[baby babbles]
[speaking in Portuguese]

16:00.667 --> 16:02.750
- WAIT, IS IT--
BUT IF I DO, YOU'RE ONBOARD?

16:02.750 --> 16:04.750
- WHY IS IT YOU THINK
I AM IN CHARGE, HUH?

16:04.750 --> 16:06.125
- CHARGE!
- I'M NOT THE ONE

16:06.125 --> 16:07.792
WHO'S IN CHARGE.
ARE YOU IN CHARGE?

16:07.792 --> 16:09.792
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.
[laughs]

16:09.792 --> 16:12.333
- CHARGE.
- I GO WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO GO

16:12.333 --> 16:14.000
AND I DO
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO, OKAY?

16:14.000 --> 16:17.166
IF I DO THOSE THINGS,
I STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.084
I SUGGEST
YOU DO THE SAME.

16:27.333 --> 16:34.583
[heart monitor beeping]
[respirator]

16:36.750 --> 16:39.667
- HE-EY.

16:39.667 --> 16:44.209
HI.

16:45.792 --> 16:50.792
[respirator]

16:50.792 --> 16:54.041
- CHICKEN SOUP.
- OH!

16:54.041 --> 16:56.208
OH.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.959
- HEY, BUSY BEAVER.

17:20.959 --> 17:23.333
YOU KNOW THE PHRASE
"SPEED KILLS"? IT'S TRUE.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.792
- JUST TRYING
TO GET THROUGH THIS STACK.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.792
- ANOTHER STACK
JUST REPLACES THIS STACK.

17:26.792 --> 17:28.167
- WHERE'S
THE NEXT STACK?

17:28.167 --> 17:30.333
- EMBRACE
THE SCIENCE OF SLOW.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.750
- YOU SHOULDA THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
BEFORE YOU MADE ME

17:31.750 --> 17:33.250
MAINLINE K-CUPS.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.458
I'VE GOT A CUP OF JET FUEL,
TWO BLACK TIGERS,

17:35.458 --> 17:36.875
AND A BUTTER TOFFEE
IN ME.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.250
FEEL LIKE
I JUST DID AN EIGHT BALL.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.458
- YOU DON'T WANNA RAISE
THE LEVEL OF EXPECTATION

17:40.458 --> 17:42.250
FOR WHEN MARIA COMES BACK
FROM SICK LEAVE.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.042
- SCIENCE OF SLOW.
- MM-HMM.

17:44.042 --> 17:45.792
I'M GONNA GRAB SOME LUNCH.
WANNA JOIN?

17:45.792 --> 17:47.667
- BROWN-BAGGING IT.
- C'MON, MY TREAT.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.000
YOU'LL PAY ME BACK
IN SPADES

17:49.000 --> 17:51.209
WHEN YOUR DOCTOR MAN
STARTS HIS OWN PRACTICE.

17:51.209 --> 17:54.042
COME ON, COME ON.
- OKAY.

17:54.042 --> 17:55.083
[barroom chatter]

17:55.083 --> 17:58.084
- HEY!
IF IT ISN'T LIBERACE!

17:58.084 --> 18:00.083
[laughter]
- LIBERACE WAS RICH.

18:00.083 --> 18:03.625
- GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD AND MOCK,
BUT I HAVE FOUND A CONSTITUENCY

18:03.625 --> 18:06.167
WILLING TO REWARD ME
FOR MY TALENTS.

18:06.167 --> 18:07.542
- LARCENY AND VOMITING?

18:07.542 --> 18:10.000
- ORATORY.
I'LL HAVE A MAKER'S MARK.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.708
MAKE IT THE GOOD--
OH, COME ON.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.167
- YOU HAVEN'T PAID YOUR TAB
IN MONTHS, FRANK.

18:13.167 --> 18:15.542
OH! GOOD FOR YOU!

18:15.542 --> 18:17.042
HERE, LET ME GIVE YOU
SOME CHANGE.

18:17.042 --> 18:18.208
- 5 BUCKS?
- YOU'RE LUCKY

18:18.208 --> 18:20.042
WE DON'T CHARGE INTEREST,
FRANK.

18:20.042 --> 18:22.042
- HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
THIS CLEANED UP IN AGES, FRANK.

18:22.042 --> 18:23.208
- UH, CHRISTMAS, 2008.

18:23.208 --> 18:25.000
YOUR MOM MADE DINNER
FOR YOU AND ME,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.458
THEN SHE WENT AWAY, AND
YOU AND I MADE THE VIDEOTAPE.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.250
YOU REMEMBER THAT?
YOU STILL HAVE IT?

18:29.250 --> 18:31.625
THAT WAS HOT!
I WENT SIX OR SEVEN ROUNDS.

18:31.625 --> 18:34.375
THAT'S CLOSE
TO MY PERSONAL BEST.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.792
- FRANK GALLAGHER?

18:35.792 --> 18:39.125
- UH,
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

18:39.125 --> 18:42.000
- ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.
ALISTAIR HUDDLESTON.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.667
CAN I BUY YOU
A DRINK?

18:44.667 --> 18:46.041
- MAKE IT TWO.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.209
TO MEN.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.291
- I WORK FOR
"RETURN TO PARADISE PROJECT."

19:06.291 --> 19:08.042
WE'RE A TRANSFORMATIONAL
MINISTRY

19:08.042 --> 19:10.209
SPECIALIZING
IN CONVERSION THERAPY.

19:10.209 --> 19:13.417
WE RETURN HOMOSEXUALS TO HEALTHY
HETEROSEXUAL LIFESTYLES.

19:13.417 --> 19:14.959
- WHY WOULD YOU
GO DO THAT?

19:14.959 --> 19:17.375
- WE BELIEVE THAT HOMOSEXUALITY
IS CURABLE.

A LESSER SIN THAN SODOMY.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.167

UNCONVENTIONAL,

20:53.167 --> 20:56.042
