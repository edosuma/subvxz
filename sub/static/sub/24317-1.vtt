11:59.452 --> 12:01.421
Hey! I don't wanna bet.
Hey! I thought
somebody said

12:01.454 --> 12:03.056
they wanted to bet.
Why don't I get the kids?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.624
I don't bet!
I don't take bets!
I don't believe in bets.

12:04.657 --> 12:09.029
Well, you're betting now.
Alex! Kenny! Come here!

12:09.062 --> 12:10.463
I hope you know
it's coming out
of my severance pay, too.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.769
Come on, guys, hurry.
This is gonna be fun.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.137
Guess what?
I'm making
Mommy a bet.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.974
Daddy's betting Mommy
$100 to just her $1

12:21.008 --> 12:23.310
that she doesn't get
a job before me.
Wow!

12:23.343 --> 12:24.812
Kenny, hold the money.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.781
I better hold it, Dad.
Money makes him crazy.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.716
JACK: Good point.
It isn't healthy.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.484
Well,
it may not be healthy
but it's fun, right?

12:31.518 --> 12:32.986
ALEX: Dad, can we
bet, too?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.254
Absolutely.
Come on.
Yay!

12:38.826 --> 12:40.460
JACK: Take the money,
Caroline.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.831
Jack, I don't
want the money.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.935
Look, you won.
A bet's a bet.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.904
(SIGHS)
Jack, I don't take bets
and I don't want your money.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.172
Look, aren't you
being a little hard
on yourself, honey?

12:52.205 --> 12:54.107
No! It's fine.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.575
I mean, you have applied
to everything on wheels

12:55.608 --> 12:59.579
from Toyota to Schwinn.
You're gonna get a job
any day now. Really.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.481
(GASPS) Oh, I'm gonna
be late on my first day.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.483
I wanna make
a very good impression.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.651
How do I look?

13:04.684 --> 13:06.854
(CHUCKLES)
You look great.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.455
You're gonna make
a great impression.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.425
Now,
do you wanna go over
that list one more time?

13:12.459 --> 13:15.295
No! I don't want
to go over the list!

13:15.328 --> 13:17.497
Okay, let's go over the list.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.799
Now remember.
When Kenny starts talking
to his breakfast,

13:19.833 --> 13:21.101
that means he's finished.
Right.
Right.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.036
And Alex has to be
at school at 7:30.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.005
Pick up is
1:00 sharp.
1:00.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.139
Now, when Megan
starts rubbing
her little ears,

13:26.173 --> 13:27.307
it means it's time
for her nap.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.109
Now, don't let her
sleep past 11:30

13:29.142 --> 13:31.011
'cause then she won't
go down for afternoon nap
which is at...

13:31.044 --> 13:32.512
1 o'clock, okay.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.447
Now, wait a minute.
Will she rub her ears
again?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.349
No, just in
the morning.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.451
And please don't
let her sit around in
her wet diapers, okay?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.521
Obviously, hon.
Now, Kenny. He'll pretty
much take care of himself,

13:41.554 --> 13:43.190
won't you, honey?
I mean, just keep him
busy, you know.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.358
Give him
his tinker toys
or his coloring book.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.328
See, I think Alex
will be a little helper,
won't you, honey?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.496
Sweetie. All right.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.663
Just relax.
You're gonna be great.

13:50.697 --> 13:51.731
There's nothing
to this, you know.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.233
Hon, we got it covered.
Right, guys?

13:53.266 --> 13:54.634
Okay.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.338
Oh! Boy, I'm gonna
miss you guys.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.173
Look, now take it
easy on Daddy.
Remember he's a rookie.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.508
Bye, Mom.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.876
Bye, honey. Yes?

14:02.910 --> 14:05.678
Mommy? It's a jungle
out there.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.348
(SCOFFS) Very funny, Jack.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.550
What? I don't know
where he gets this?

14:10.583 --> 14:11.885
You know, on second thought,
I think I will
take this money.

14:11.919 --> 14:15.855
I might need it for lunch
or something special.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.725
Actually, a lot of men would
love to have this kind of time
to spend with their kids...

14:18.758 --> 14:21.061
Hon, hon.
You're looking at one.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.163
I'm telling you.
I'm a regular

14:23.196 --> 14:24.531
Yes, you are.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.136
(SIGHS) Okay.
Come here.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.207
Go get 'em.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.378
Oh, thanks for the loan.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.560
JACK: Passed what?
We're right on time.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.862
But, Dad!
You're doing it wrong.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.231
Mommy doesn't
do it like this.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.201
We're gonna do it
the Jack Butler method.
What is this?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.302
This is nuts.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.744
Why are they
all honking?

15:11.778 --> 15:14.281
Because you're
doing it wrong.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.783
Tell me I'm doing it wrong?
I know how to do this.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.651

Hi, Jack.
I'm Annette.

You're
doing it wrong.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.099
See?

15:32.132 --> 15:34.467
This is what I tell
all my new mommies.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.568
We enter
from the south,

15:35.602 --> 15:37.904
and we exit
from the north.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.839
And then we do
just the reverse
when we pick up.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.441
This way our little ones
don't have to walk

15:41.474 --> 15:43.576
between the cars to get
to the learning facility.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.512
Okay, move it out.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.181
Remember.
South to drop off,
north to pick up.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.817

Okay, that's a good system.

Ron? And who
would Ron be?

16:42.435 --> 16:45.372
calls him
"Mr. Richardson."

16:45.405 --> 16:47.374
Well, he asked me
to call him "Ron."

16:47.407 --> 16:50.810
And when was that?
In what context?

16:50.843 --> 16:53.213
In the context
of my interview at lunch.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.682
Lunch?

16:58.185 --> 16:59.552
Well, now,
before we go in here,

16:59.586 --> 17:01.254
let me give you
some advice.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.156

learn something.

It's the cornerstone
of all our accounts.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.563
So my position is,

17:43.596 --> 17:46.966
somebody better figure out
a way to sell some tuna fish

Well, I'm glad
somebody had a good day.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.399
Have a seat.
I'll call you
when he's ready.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.867
Thank you.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.569
MAN: How about
roasted eggplant?

37:17.603 --> 37:18.637
I don't know.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.372
Does your wife
like seafood?

37:20.406 --> 37:22.808
Yeah, but seafood
smells up the kitchen,

37:22.841 --> 37:24.075
and it can take hours
to get rid of that odor.

37:24.109 --> 37:25.811
No. How about
something simple?

37:25.844 --> 37:28.314
Oh. I've got
a Hamburger Wellington
that's out of this world.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.048
Well, great,
let me have it.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.951
Okay, start with
two pounds of ground round,
lean and mean.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.320
Brown it
in some butter.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.987
Yeah.
Pardon me.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.155
Could you use
margarine in that
or butter?

37:37.188 --> 37:39.925
Well, butter's
my personal choice.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.793
Yeah, but butter
can scorch.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.562
Higgins, you're next.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.798
Oh, why don't you go ahead,
and I'll go after you?

37:46.832 --> 37:48.166
Well, you
were here first.

37:48.199 --> 37:51.236
Oh, that's okay.
I have no place to go,

37:51.269 --> 37:53.405
and besides that,
there's not
a job available

37:53.439 --> 37:54.473
anywhere
in this city.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.975
(BOTH LAUGHING)

37:57.008 --> 37:58.644
Okay, Butler,
I guess you're next.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.114
I'd sure like to have
a copy of that
when I come back.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.783
Yeah, sure.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.952
Okay, drain all
the excess fat.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.119
Yeah, okay.

you're mad, aren't you?

38:16.495 --> 38:18.263
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.431
It's just not where
I want to be right now.

38:19.465 --> 38:20.699
Mmm-hmm?

38:20.732 --> 38:22.801
Well, Jack,
I can't not go.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.704
I mean,
please do it for me,
would you?

38:25.737 --> 38:27.539
You know how many
of these things
I went to for you?

38:27.573 --> 38:29.841
A lot.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.477
We'll stay 10 minutes.
10 minutes.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.512
Ten minutes?

(SIGHS) Fifteen tops.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.484
Oh. All right, okay.
Fair enough.

38:38.517 --> 38:39.851
But if we stay
longer than that,

38:39.885 --> 38:41.186
we pull the old
Aunt Emily.

38:41.219 --> 38:42.988
Okay, the Aunt Emily,
right.

38:48.026 --> 38:51.663
Wow! What a house!

38:51.697 --> 38:53.865
Yeah.
Probably mortgaged
to the eyeballs.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.701
CAROLINE: Not this one.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.504
His great-grandfather,
Commander Richardson
built it.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.005
JACK: Yeah.
A hand-me-down.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.812
Oh, thank you.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.214
RON: Jack, you must be
pretty darn proud
of our little Caroline, huh?

39:09.247 --> 39:12.083
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
we're very proud of her,

39:12.117 --> 39:14.686
and the children are,
and we're all real
proud of her at home.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.987
She earned
that promotion.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.989
I can
assure you, Jack.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.257
It was a little promotion.
I forgot to tell you
about it.

It was no big deal.

a sportsman.

39:33.572 --> 39:34.940
I was kind of
counting on you
to take part in this.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.408
You know,
spouses are eligible.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.343
Yeah, I don't know.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.746
Oh, come on.
Nobody takes it seriously.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.914
It's just
good clean fun.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.783
I know, Ron,
normally, I'd say yeah,

39:44.816 --> 39:48.253
but I'll tell you,
we got to get over to see
Caroline's Aunt Emily.

39:48.286 --> 39:49.688
She's... Dying.
Sick.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.190
Dead?

39:52.223 --> 39:54.125
Well, why don't you
stick around for
a few minutes anyway

39:54.159 --> 39:56.462
and you can watch
with the rest of the wives.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.929

I mean, families.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.433

boys, run down to the car

40:03.301 --> 40:06.071
and get Dad's
sweat pants and shoes
and stuff out.

gonna win anyway.

blame it on you now.

45:13.745 --> 45:15.713
You threw me at him.

45:15.747 --> 45:18.917
You let him know
 it was perfectly fine to
 take me to San Francisco,

45:18.950 --> 45:22.720
only he took me
 to bed first,
 and it's your fault!

45:22.754 --> 45:25.023
Did I tell you?
I knew it.

one husband.

 I'm gonna let that
 get into the record

 Or for the child to
 find out later on?

 we'll just have a
 no-fault divorce.

45:38.136 --> 45:40.738

 It's certainly true enough.

45:40.772 --> 45:42.808
No, Nikki,
 I won't do it.

 is the baby.

 than Caroline?

it be Victor?

home to them.

your coupons.

but Ron gave me this
tuna presentation to do

50:00.931 --> 50:03.201
and I'm really
way behind.

50:03.234 --> 50:05.136
Well, you've got to
eat something, honey.

50:05.170 --> 50:07.338
Well, if I wanted
something to eat, Jack,

50:07.372 --> 50:10.375
I would've come down
and had something to eat
with you and your girlfriends.

50:11.942 --> 50:13.211
All right.

50:14.045 --> 50:15.813

Get into this.

about the beard?
All right.

The beard's in its
transitional stage
right now, that's all.

50:28.359 --> 50:31.662
When it comes in
it's gonna look great.

50:31.696 --> 50:34.065
It's gonna look like
that movie star, uh,
what's his name?

50:34.765 --> 50:36.501

50:36.534 --> 50:39.170

Yeah, I've put on
a couple pounds.

So what? Come on.
What else do you have?

50:49.447 --> 50:51.416

about this shirt
for a second, Jack?

50:51.449 --> 50:53.050
All right.

You've been wearing this
shirt around the house

50:54.552 --> 50:56.521
for about two weeks now.
It can walk around by itself.

Why don't you retire
that thing to the dry cleaning
hall of fame, huh?

50:58.723 --> 51:00.125
Because it's
a comfortable shirt.

Jack, take a look
at yourself.

51:01.592 --> 51:03.728
You've really thrown in
the towel, honey.

is like oatmeal.

Kenny today for
coloring outside the lines.

starting to watch
the same TV shows

you're talking about.

51:18.343 --> 51:20.245
I've been there
myself, all right?

51:20.278 --> 51:21.946
Well, if you were so unhappy,
why didn't you say
something about it?

51:21.979 --> 51:23.648
Because I
wasn't unhappy.

51:23.681 --> 51:25.116
Look. Maybe I was
a little confused,

51:25.150 --> 51:26.951
maybe I was
a little frustrated,

51:26.984 --> 51:29.154
but I knew
what I was doing
was important

51:29.187 --> 51:30.087
because it means
something to raise
decent human beings.

51:30.121 --> 51:31.789
What saw me through
was pride.

51:31.822 --> 51:33.924
I had pride
in this house.
I had pride in my kids

51:33.958 --> 51:36.261

being Mrs. Jack Butler!

through the door.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:23.280
I hope to hell
you're making a point.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.715
Well, I am making
a point, Mr. Humphries.
The point is,

01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:28.618
Schooner Tuna is one
of the three most expensive
tunas on the market.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.387
Now, if we want to
beat our competitors

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.722
the time for these
gimmicks and giveaways
is over with.

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:35.859
Now, I don't mean
to be disrespectful,
Mr. Humphries

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:38.228
but housewives
need your help,
not your gimmicks.

01:06:38.262 --> 01:06:40.830
Show them that
you really care
about their problems,

01:06:40.864 --> 01:06:42.499
and you'll win
their loyalty.

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:45.235
Now, this is
what I propose.

01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:49.306
"Schooner Tuna sympathizes
with those hit so hard by
this trying economy.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:52.576
"To help you,
we are reducing the price of
our tuna by 50 cents a can.

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:56.012
"When this crisis is over,
we'll go back to
our regular prices.

01:06:56.046 --> 01:06:58.715
"Until then, remember,
we're all in this together.

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:02.286
"Signed, Howard Humphries,
President, Schooner Tuna,
the tuna with a heart."

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:13.163
Well, you've got
a plane to catch.

01:07:13.197 --> 01:07:14.698
I'm really sorry...

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:16.766
Damn well right,
you're sorry.

01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:19.369
Yes, I am.

01:07:19.403 --> 01:07:23.039
Where in the hell
have you been hiding
this little girl?

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:26.176
She's not just
selling tuna, son.
She's selling America.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.345
Right!

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.679
"The tuna with a heart."
I love this
bleeding-heart shit.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:31.281
That's American!
That's what that is!

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:33.016
That's what I think.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.551
Well, there's more.

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.052
More?
There is?

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:37.621
Yes.

(LAUGHING HEARTILY)

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:49.599
Caroline,
congratulations!

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:50.867
Thank you,
thank you.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.136
I'm so impressed
with you.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:03.247
Hi. I'm here for
Mrs. Butler. 8:00 flight.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.914
Right.
She'll be right out.

01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:05.982
Okay.

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:14.391
Why do you
have to go
to California?

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:17.060
'Cause that's where
we're gonna make the
tuna commercial, honey.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.296
Can't you go
tomorrow, Mommy?

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.265
No, I can't.
Because everyone else
is going tonight.

01:08:22.299 --> 01:08:23.567
And I have to go.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.769
But you know what?
I'm gonna be back

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.104
before you go to your
first meeting of the
knights of the round table.

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:29.173
I promise.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.410
Bye, honey.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:34.377
Bye, sweetie.

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:40.917
Wait, guys,
stay right here.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.319
Alex, Kenny,
watch her for
a minute, okay?

01:08:43.353 --> 01:08:44.388
Let me talk to you.

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:50.359
Two hours notice,
and you're off to
Los Angeles like that.

01:08:50.394 --> 01:08:52.761
(SIGHS) Jack,
there is nothing
I could do about it.

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:56.433
I convinced a man today
to spend $11 million
on one of my ideas.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.435
I got to go!

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.136
Besides, honey,
there's gonna be other
Halloweens, you know.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:01.671
I know there'll be
other Halloweens

01:09:01.705 --> 01:09:04.207
but I'm thinking
about this Halloween.

01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:06.876
Caroline, these kids,
in a couple of years, are
gonna outgrow this thing.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:09.479
Oh, really?
You don't seem to
have outgrown it, Jack.

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:14.384
All right.
I admit it.
I like Halloween.

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:15.719
Yeah, well,
so do I, honey.

01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:18.221
Remember I was
going to dress up as
a prison matron tonight?

01:09:20.557 --> 01:09:24.027
Point is, Megan just
got two new teeth.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.028
I'll bet
you didn't know that.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.729
Alex is
playing football.

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:28.698
Remember Kenny's
security blanket?

01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:30.867
He doesn't have it anymore.
Doesn't use it. It's gone.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:33.403
You know, if you
were here I was gonna
suggest you go as a ghost.

01:09:33.437 --> 01:09:35.671
'Cause even when
you're here,
you're not here.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.975
Caroline, we really
have to get going.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.912
Hey, Madison Avenue,
lighten up.

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:44.481
All right, Jack.
What do you want
me to do?

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:47.884
Not go? Not try?
Not succeed?

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.386
Of course not.
I want you to succeed.
And...

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:57.261
You gave me some
real good advice once.

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:59.529
So now let me
give you some of mine.

forget what's important.

be back in
less than a week.

talk about this then?

be all right.

off again, huh?

Please. Daddy will
buy you a T-bird.

down there, honey.

she's here now, Dad!

Yeah. Listen,

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:47.604
now, what this
is about is it's a...

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.540
It's a review board.
Now, it's just a formality.

01:11:50.574 --> 01:11:52.709
They're gonna ask you
a couple of questions...

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.212
Jack, if you
could back me up

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:59.549
I think I can
get you back on
at half salary.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:02.318
What are you talking about?
You didn't say anything about
half salary on the phone.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.690
Mr. Latham, Mr. Butler,
you can go in now.

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:08.124
According to
our records

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.959
since you and
your associates left,

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:13.730
production in
your division is
off by 23 percent,

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:17.233
and costs are up 19 percent.
You have any explanation
for that?

01:12:19.569 --> 01:12:23.673
I'm a little confused here.
I'm no longer with
the company.

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:25.274
I don't know.
You might ask Mr. Latham.

01:12:26.242 --> 01:12:27.444
We have.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.747
JACK: And?

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.116
I'm sorry, Jack.
I covered for you guys
as long as I could.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.755
You covered for us?

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:41.357
Yeah.

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:47.130
That's a lie.
That's not true.

01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:50.834
Come on, Jack.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:52.669
Larry and Stan
were in here.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.772
Now, they already admitted
that I covered for them.
Now, come on.

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:58.141
It's time
for you to be
a stand-up guy.

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:04.848
Larry and Stan would say
anything you wanted
them to say.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.483
They need their jobs.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.886
You want me to be
a stand-up guy?

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:11.921
Okay, I'll be
a stand-up guy.

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:15.892
I need my job, too,
but what's going on
here is wrong.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.564
If I did such a bad job,

01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:25.435
why did production go down
and costs go up
after you fired me?

01:13:25.469 --> 01:13:27.971
Huh? Look,
I don't know what
this guy told you.

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:29.739

what he does
with his books.

I'm not an accountant.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.281

I take a lot of pride
in my work.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:44.053

to get out of here now.

I know it's not
real popular right now,

you know,
taking pride
in your work.

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:54.130
But I did,
I cared.

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:55.965
You fired me for it.

01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:58.602
If you ever talk to
my kid like that again
I'm knocking you out.

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:11.581
Forget the paper.

01:14:11.615 --> 01:14:14.918

after all this is over?

I want to go back to the hotel
and soak in a hot tub.

a great idea.

Forget about it.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:48.411

is that you didn't get fired.

to look at it,

01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:33.782
I thought you
loved that job.

01:27:33.816 --> 01:27:35.217
Thanks.
How about three days
at the office

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:36.485
and two days
at home?
Thanks.

01:27:36.519 --> 01:27:38.086
(CHATTERING)

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.389
Jack, will you
listen to me?

01:27:40.423 --> 01:27:42.391
Management wants you back.

01:27:42.425 --> 01:27:43.992
Jack.

01:27:44.026 --> 01:27:45.461
Thanks.
Basement's clean.

01:27:45.494 --> 01:27:47.430
Okay.
Oh, thanks.

01:27:47.463 --> 01:27:50.433
Look, he's offering me
full salary and a company car.
What do you think?

01:27:50.466 --> 01:27:52.234
Are you kidding?
Take it.
Okay look, Bert,

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.102
tell him I don't
make a move
without Larry and Stan.

01:27:54.136 --> 01:27:55.771
He doesn't make a move
without Larry and Stan.

01:27:55.804 --> 01:27:57.773
Oh, you got a deal.

01:27:57.806 --> 01:27:59.007
Who are
Larry and Stan?
Thanks.

01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:05.781
You really hit him?

01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:07.350
Don't you think
I know how to take
care of myself?

01:28:09.718 --> 01:28:11.587
Hurt your hand?

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:12.621
No.

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:16.492
Missed you.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:19.995
I missed you, too.

01:28:25.668 --> 01:28:27.135
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:29.538
My fellow Americans,

01:28:29.572 --> 01:28:32.508
I am Howard Humphries,
 President of Schooner Tuna.

01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:35.444
All of us here at
 Schooner Tuna sympathize

01:28:35.478 --> 01:28:39.715
with those of you
 hit so hard by these
 trying economic times.

01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:43.519
In order to help you,
 we are reducing the
 price of Schooner Tuna

01:28:43.552 --> 01:28:46.121
by 50 cents a can.

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:49.492
When this crisis is over
 we will go back to
 our regular prices.

01:28:49.525 --> 01:28:53.496
Until then, remember,
 we're all in this together.

01:28:53.529 --> 01:28:56.264
Schooner Tuna,
 the tuna with a heart.

01:28:59.768 --> 01:29:01.336
