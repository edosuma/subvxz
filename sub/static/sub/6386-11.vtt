The prosecution have a lame case.
And they know it too.

00:05.051 --> 00:07.352
Now we have a serious conflict.

00:07.386 --> 00:08.587
It's your choice, Hank.

00:08.621 --> 00:11.323
What do you want me to do,
fuck you or defend you?

00:11.357 --> 00:13.191
Monday I'll take you to court

00:13.226 --> 00:17.362
so that you can stand trial
for raping a teenage girl.

00:17.396 --> 00:18.730
I don't want you to be guilty.

00:18.764 --> 00:20.532
I don't want people
to look at you that way.

00:20.566 --> 00:25.237
The state of California
versus Hank Moody. All rise.

00:25.271 --> 00:27.038
Fuck.
The rabbit done died.

00:27.073 --> 00:28.907
- So whose is it?
- I don't know!

00:28.941 --> 00:30.108
I'm pregnant.

00:30.142 --> 00:32.511
Oh, Jesus.

00:32.545 --> 00:33.712
I'm gonna be a father!

00:33.746 --> 00:36.381
- Trixie.
- That is a terrific name...

00:36.415 --> 00:37.749
If you're a hooker.

00:37.783 --> 00:39.985
Take Diners Club?
I'm not kidding.

00:40.019 --> 00:41.753
What adult film
were you watching?

00:41.787 --> 00:42.921
Excuse me?

00:42.955 --> 00:44.022
Ow!
What the...

00:44.056 --> 00:45.857
You saw Hank Moody
with your daughter

00:45.892 --> 00:48.560
prior to the night
of August 13th?

00:48.594 --> 00:50.529
Yes.

00:50.563 --> 00:52.564
Quiet down.

00:52.598 --> 00:54.733
That jury is now
under the assumption

00:54.767 --> 00:57.002
that you knew Mia before
you actually slept together.

00:57.036 --> 00:59.571

Right. Right.

You can't let the priests
have all the fun. Right?

04:43.129 --> 04:44.562
How can I help?

04:44.597 --> 04:47.599
It seems I've been judged,
juried, and found

04:47.633 --> 04:48.933
pretty fucking guilty.

04:48.968 --> 04:50.602
Yes, you most certainly have.

04:50.636 --> 04:53.505
What's my move here?

04:53.539 --> 04:55.240
Well, I think you should
probably get in your car

04:55.274 --> 04:57.776
and drive as fast as you can.

04:57.810 --> 04:59.544
- I don't have a car.
- Steal one.

04:59.578 --> 05:01.746
You know,
for... for a woman of the cloth,

05:01.781 --> 05:04.415
you're... you're pretty
morally ambivalent, sister.

05:04.450 --> 05:05.617
I'm just saying.

05:05.651 --> 05:07.318
Don't be such a fucking
faggot, Hank.

05:07.353 --> 05:10.054
Ha. Jesus. Whoa. Sorry.

05:10.089 --> 05:12.724
What about my family
and friends?

05:12.758 --> 05:13.758
What about them?

05:13.793 --> 05:17.829
Well, it seems
pretty fucking...

05:17.863 --> 05:22.901
Pretty mean of me
to do that to them.

05:22.935 --> 05:25.970
Seriously?
Do you really think they care?

05:26.005 --> 05:28.973
At first, sure.

05:29.008 --> 05:30.842
But after a while,

05:30.876 --> 05:32.443
wouldn't they be better off?

05:32.478 --> 05:35.947
Maybe.

05:35.981 --> 05:41.486
Now how about that blowjob?

05:41.520 --> 05:44.522
Oh, dear God.

05:44.557 --> 05:46.624
Hank is going to hell again.

06:31.670 --> 06:33.037
- Ooh.
- Busted.

06:33.072 --> 06:36.975
Hey. I was just gonna make us
some breakfast.

06:37.009 --> 06:38.243
Bullshit.

06:38.277 --> 06:40.044
Okay, I was just about
to go get us some breakfast.

06:40.079 --> 06:42.146
- Bullshittier.
- All right, you got me.

06:42.181 --> 06:44.015
I was gonna maybe steal
a cup of coffee.

06:44.049 --> 06:46.284
- And then leave.
- Well, eventually.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.652
Might've dropped a deuce first.

06:47.686 --> 06:49.854
Oh, God, what lovely morning-after talk.

06:49.889 --> 06:51.656
Well, you don't want me
to move in with you, do you?

06:51.690 --> 06:52.891
- God, no.
- Good.

06:52.925 --> 06:57.428
I'm glad we got that settled.

06:57.463 --> 06:59.063
Hey, how are you doing
this morning?

06:59.098 --> 07:00.832
I'm actually doing fantastic.

07:00.866 --> 07:04.035
I'm happy to have gotten
some primo heterosexual coupling

07:04.069 --> 07:05.670
out of the way
before I get shipped off

07:05.704 --> 07:07.272
to the big house
where I'm gonna have to start

07:07.306 --> 07:09.040
taking large objects
in the pooper.

07:09.074 --> 07:12.443
Hank, we have no idea
what your sentencing will be.

07:12.478 --> 07:14.579
I mean, you could be looking
at probation.

07:14.613 --> 07:16.014
Yeah. I could be looking
at prison.

07:16.048 --> 07:18.283
I think I should prepare
for the worstest.

07:18.317 --> 07:20.952
I do like a man
who prepares for the worstest.

07:20.986 --> 07:25.690
Hmm. I should probably
get going.

07:25.724 --> 07:28.860
There might be some folks
that are worried sick about me.

07:28.894 --> 07:31.362
Or not. One never knows
these days.

07:31.397 --> 07:35.033
Hey, um, don't do anything
stupid out there, okay?

07:35.067 --> 07:38.937
Who, me?
Impossible.

07:42.408 --> 07:44.375
Thanks for bending the rules
last night.

07:44.410 --> 07:46.244
Among other things.

07:46.278 --> 07:49.314
Well, seeing as I failed
to get you off,

07:49.348 --> 07:51.649
I figured I might as well
throw you a pity bang.

07:51.684 --> 07:54.385
Oh, that's funny because
I knew you would be beating

07:54.420 --> 07:55.653
yourself up about that,

07:55.688 --> 07:57.188
so I was actually throwing you
a pity bang.

07:57.222 --> 07:59.023
Oh, my God.
You're so generous. So sweet.

07:59.058 --> 08:01.192
Yeah, I'm gonna make
some white power guy

08:01.226 --> 08:03.628
an excellent bitch.

08:20.646 --> 08:22.347
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

08:22.381 --> 08:25.650
- You're Hank Moody.
- Yes. Yes, I am.

08:25.684 --> 08:28.519
And you are?
I mean, what number are you?

08:28.554 --> 08:30.788
I don't get it.
I'm Peggy.

08:30.823 --> 08:32.890
Hey, Peggy.
It's not hugely important.

08:32.924 --> 08:37.260
- Is the Runkasaur around?
- Upstairs. Going poo-poo.

08:37.296 --> 08:39.964
- Gross.
- You were found guilty.

08:39.999 --> 08:43.101
- Yes. Yes, I was.
- Of rape.

08:43.135 --> 08:45.003
- Statutory rape.
- Whatever.

08:45.037 --> 08:46.738
Still got "rape" in it.

08:46.772 --> 08:50.942
Hank? Hank? Hank?

08:50.976 --> 08:53.678
There you are.
I tried you all day yesterday.

08:53.712 --> 08:56.214
- Are you okay?
- I guess.

08:56.248 --> 08:59.751
Oh.

09:02.521 --> 09:04.422
Hmm?

09:10.362 --> 09:13.531
No, no, I don't think
that would be appropriate.

09:13.565 --> 09:17.902
Well, not right now anyway.

09:17.936 --> 09:21.939
"I don't think
that would be appropriate."

09:21.974 --> 09:22.974
What'd she say?

09:23.008 --> 09:24.609
She wanted
to play "Home Invasion."

09:24.643 --> 09:26.544
Yeah, you break in,
pistol-whip me,

09:26.578 --> 09:28.546
tie me to a chair,
and then I have to watch

09:28.580 --> 09:30.014
while you rape her.

09:30.049 --> 09:33.117
What is wrong with kids today?

09:33.152 --> 09:37.789
- Well, no, I'm too tired.
- That's what I figured.

09:37.823 --> 09:40.458
I would like to pistol-whip you though.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.727
How you doing, buddy?
How you holding up?

09:42.761 --> 09:45.329
Pretty shitty. I might have
to go to prison, Charlie.

09:45.364 --> 09:47.465
I know. I'm so sorry.

09:47.499 --> 09:50.468
Oh, boy.
It's okay, buddy boy.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.970
It's all gonna be okay.
This is not about you.

09:53.005 --> 09:56.140

cheer you up.

Because I'm sick and tired

13:34.126 --> 13:37.795
Never wrap my lips
around another male member

13:37.829 --> 13:39.230
unless I want to.

13:39.264 --> 13:44.235
Mm. If I had a dime
for every time I've said that.

13:44.269 --> 13:47.071
Sounds like a plan, Trixie.
You should totally do that.

13:47.105 --> 13:49.140
Maybe you should totally
come with me.

13:49.174 --> 13:50.775
I totally should, but I can't.

13:50.809 --> 13:52.843
Running's not the right move
for me right now.

13:52.878 --> 13:56.514
Really? Running seems
like exactly the right move

13:56.548 --> 13:58.649
for you right now.

13:58.684 --> 14:01.585
- Mm.
- Well, I've been to jail once.

14:01.620 --> 14:06.123
<i>No bueno.</i>

14:06.158 --> 14:11.128
I promised myself if they ever
came for me again...

14:11.163 --> 14:15.399
Feets don't fail me now,
I am hitting the fucking road.

14:15.434 --> 14:18.302
Besides, what's the point
of rotting in prison

14:18.337 --> 14:21.138
for a crime you didn't commit?

14:21.173 --> 14:23.874
- Well, I did fuck the girl.
- But you didn't rape her.

14:23.909 --> 14:26.077
No! No.

14:26.111 --> 14:28.612
I'm not judging.
I see all types.

14:28.647 --> 14:31.949
- Well, I'm not that type.
- I know you're not.

14:31.983 --> 14:37.888
You're an outlaw, Hank.
Just like me.

14:37.923 --> 14:43.160
So...Do you want to do
this thing or what?

14:43.195 --> 14:47.631
Do you think that I could
pay you just to be nice to me

14:47.666 --> 14:50.968
for a little while?

14:51.002 --> 14:52.970
Sure thing, Hank.

15:02.748 --> 15:05.916
Good morning, dear.
Milk and two sugars.

15:05.951 --> 15:08.986
Thank you, mother.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.921
- Kisses?
- Oh.

15:10.956 --> 15:14.525
Ah, pumpkin, good morning.

15:14.559 --> 15:18.462
Kisses?

15:18.497 --> 15:22.633
- Have a nice day, dear.
- I will. Thank you, sweetheart.

15:26.505 --> 15:28.339
Honeys, I'm home!

15:32.878 --> 15:36.514
Mm. Is that mom's cherry pie
I smell?

15:36.548 --> 15:40.851
I love mom's cherry pie!

15:40.886 --> 15:42.186
"Once upon a time,

15:42.220 --> 15:44.255
"there was a little boy
who always wanted

15:44.289 --> 15:46.424
"more than he had.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.092
"But when he finally grew up,

15:48.126 --> 15:50.161
"he found out
that he had everything

15:50.195 --> 15:53.030
"he could have ever wanted
all along.

15:53.064 --> 15:58.002
The end."

15:58.036 --> 15:59.870
Good night, scout.

15:59.905 --> 16:03.374
Good night, dad.

16:03.408 --> 16:06.777
- What's burning?
- I am.

16:11.683 --> 16:13.551
Have a seat.

17:36.935 --> 17:38.402
Fuck.

17:41.506 --> 17:46.043
Hello? Marcy?

17:46.077 --> 17:49.947
What?
What happened?

18:00.592 --> 18:05.262
Hello?

18:05.297 --> 18:07.064
Surprise!

18:07.098 --> 18:09.833
Surpri-i-ise!

18:09.868 --> 18:12.269
We wanted to throw you
a "Hank Is Innocent" party.

18:12.304 --> 18:14.939
But we had to work
with what you gave us.

18:14.973 --> 18:18.208
Assholes.

18:20.712 --> 18:23.847
Remember the time though
when we went to Santa Barbara

18:23.882 --> 18:26.116
and Mr. Anally Fixated
over here

18:26.151 --> 18:28.185
got us kicked out
of the hotel pool?

18:28.219 --> 18:30.387
Oh, my God.
That was so embarrassing.

18:30.422 --> 18:32.323
Why was that again,
Charlie? Why?

18:32.357 --> 18:34.058
Well, I cannot speak
of such things

18:34.092 --> 18:35.192
in front of the young lady.

18:35.226 --> 18:36.293
- Thank you.
- Why?

18:36.328 --> 18:38.963
She knows what a disgusting perv
you are.

18:38.997 --> 18:41.799
I do. I made peace
with it a long time ago.

18:41.833 --> 18:43.434
It doesn't mean you're not
a nice man.

18:43.468 --> 18:44.835
Well, thank you, Becca.

18:44.869 --> 18:46.604
You're every inch
the Van Der Moody.

18:46.638 --> 18:49.873
That's my girl.
Up high. Come on.

18:49.908 --> 18:53.277
Okay. Okay. I, uh,
wanted to pleasure myself

18:53.311 --> 18:55.546
while that little pump thingy
blew water up my butt.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.881
- It felt good.
- Okay, Charlie, enough.

18:57.916 --> 18:59.416
- Oh, my God, that's so gross.
- You told it.

18:59.451 --> 19:00.985
I suppose I probably
shouldn't have taken

19:01.019 --> 19:04.588
- my bathing suit off.
- Oh, God.

19:04.623 --> 19:06.256
I'm throwing up
in my mouth right now.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.492
Pity those poor kids
who are never going to forget

19:08.526 --> 19:10.761
this image of this big,
naked, man baby

19:10.795 --> 19:11.996
rising up from the water

19:12.030 --> 19:14.598
like the creature
from the pasty white lagoon.

19:14.633 --> 19:16.734
It's no grosser
than your mother and father.

19:16.768 --> 19:18.836
They used to sneak off to do it
everywhere all the time.

19:18.870 --> 19:20.104
- Shut up.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

19:20.138 --> 19:22.973
- In bathrooms, utility closets.
- Yeah. Yes. Yes.

19:23.008 --> 19:26.076
True. Didn't you schlob
Hank's knob on a balcony once?

19:26.111 --> 19:27.845
Marcy, can you shut
the fuck up?

19:27.879 --> 19:30.648
Oh, like it's a secret you
guys are a couple of nymphos.

19:30.682 --> 19:32.850
It's better than growing up
with my family.

19:32.884 --> 19:34.918
I can't ever remember my parents
even touching one another.

19:34.953 --> 19:36.487
Sorry, Beckers.

19:36.521 --> 19:39.723
You must be so bored
by all this grown-up talk.

19:39.758 --> 19:41.892
Is this grown-up talk?

19:41.926 --> 19:43.727
I don't know what it is.

19:43.762 --> 19:46.730
No, it's nice seeing you guys
together like this

19:46.765 --> 19:48.999
reminds me of a better time.

19:49.034 --> 19:51.402
Not better, sweetie.
Just different.

19:51.436 --> 19:54.271
It was better.
I know it was. I was there.

19:54.305 --> 19:57.041
It was an illusion, baby.
Magic trick.

19:57.075 --> 19:58.676
I know you think I'm too young
to understand,

19:58.710 --> 20:00.177
but I was there.

20:00.211 --> 20:02.346
I was watching.
I was listening.

20:02.380 --> 20:06.850
You guys were all happy
and in love and I felt safe.

20:06.885 --> 20:08.352
I was looking forward
to being a grown-up

20:08.386 --> 20:10.220
because it looked
like so much fun.

20:10.255 --> 20:12.856
And then somewhere
it all went wrong.

20:12.891 --> 20:14.191
I don't know
if it was California

20:14.225 --> 20:15.926
or just you guys,
but it all changed one day

20:15.960 --> 20:17.394
almost overnight.

20:17.429 --> 20:21.498
Take it from someone who was
watching and taking notes.

20:21.533 --> 20:26.336
You guys were good together.

20:26.371 --> 20:29.106
I tend to agree with the girl.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.208
You're wise and beautiful,
you know that?

20:31.242 --> 20:34.211
You make us feel old
and stupid.

20:34.245 --> 20:36.046
And we love you for it.

20:39.384 --> 20:42.219
- I don't want to go to sleep.
- Why not?

20:42.253 --> 20:43.654
'Cause I don't know
if you'll be here

20:43.688 --> 20:48.025
when I wake up.

20:48.059 --> 20:51.662
We'll talk about it later.

20:51.696 --> 20:53.397
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:53.431 --> 20:55.466
Good night.

20:59.671 --> 21:03.907
God, I wish I could get high
with y'all.

21:03.942 --> 21:06.744
I mean, the baby's not gonna
go full retard

21:06.778 --> 21:09.346
if I just get the tiniest bit
whacked, right?

21:09.380 --> 21:12.349
- The baby.
- It won't.

21:12.383 --> 21:14.017
I cannot endorse that shit.

21:14.052 --> 21:17.488
I mean, this... this medicinal
stuff is strong.

21:17.522 --> 21:20.457
Well, I know.
So you better be careful.

21:20.492 --> 21:22.726
Especially you, Jackamo.

21:22.761 --> 21:26.597
You can never handle your weed.

21:26.631 --> 21:29.900
I feel like I'm wearing
a very warm toupee right now.

21:29.934 --> 21:32.736
And I feel a tingling
in my underpants.

21:32.771 --> 21:34.805
That'd be me, Bogart.
Come on.

21:34.839 --> 21:37.307
You see that?
Becca was right.

21:37.342 --> 21:39.576
We're good together.
We were good together.

21:39.611 --> 21:43.881
We still are.
God damn it.

21:43.915 --> 21:48.252
Well, if she's right,
then how did we end up here?

21:48.286 --> 21:52.890
- I mean, hi, my name's Karen.
- Hi, Karen.

21:52.924 --> 21:54.992
Hello, Karen.

21:55.026 --> 21:58.929
The love of my life
and the father of my child

21:58.963 --> 22:04.101
is...is a convicted
child molester.

22:04.135 --> 22:09.273
- Yeah, dude! Hee hee hee.
- Oh, my God. Hello!

22:09.307 --> 22:11.375
And you're the crazy bitch
who stayed with him

22:11.409 --> 22:12.376
all of these years.

22:12.410 --> 22:14.711
- I know!
- Oh, my God.

22:14.746 --> 22:16.213
- What is wrong with me?
- Seriously.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.782
No, babe, you're like
one of those freaky cunts

22:18.817 --> 22:21.018
who marries the serial killers
on death row.

22:21.052 --> 22:23.387
Jesus Christ, Marcy, I'm right here!

22:23.421 --> 22:25.422
- Sorry, but...
- And what about you?

22:25.456 --> 22:26.824
You're having
an out-of-wedlock baby

22:26.858 --> 22:27.991
with Stu Beggs.

22:28.026 --> 22:29.393
Church.

22:29.427 --> 22:31.662
I'm just glad it's not
Rick Springfield's baby.

22:31.696 --> 22:35.265
Okay, cock-snot,
what about you?

22:35.300 --> 22:37.267
You're out there sticking
your micro-phallus

22:37.302 --> 22:39.670
into some
seriously damaged pussy.

22:39.704 --> 22:42.105
Church. I met one of those
this morning.

22:42.140 --> 22:44.775
- Come on.
- Charlie.

22:44.809 --> 22:47.711
She seemed like she
was out of her fucking gourd.

22:47.745 --> 22:51.582
Peggy. She blows my mind.
Sexually.

22:51.616 --> 22:54.418
- She has no boundaries.
- You need boundaries.

22:54.452 --> 22:58.255
Sometimes you just need someone
to say "No, let's not do that

22:58.289 --> 23:00.190
because that is fucking sick."

23:00.225 --> 23:01.925
Otherwise, we'd all be
running around

23:01.960 --> 23:04.094
with shit, piss, and blood
all over our damn selves

23:04.128 --> 23:06.563
and shoving vibrators
up our asses all day.

23:06.598 --> 23:09.299
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

23:12.570 --> 23:15.138
Hank, I'm gonna miss you.

23:15.173 --> 23:17.474
Oh, Marce, why'd you have
to do that?

23:17.508 --> 23:18.642
Eehee-hee.

23:18.676 --> 23:20.711
We were having
such a good time.

23:20.745 --> 23:22.880
I know. But I love you
and I don't want you

23:22.914 --> 23:24.414
to be in trouble.

23:24.449 --> 23:27.484
I want things to go back
to the way they were.

23:27.518 --> 23:32.089
- Mm.
- The way we were.

23:32.123 --> 23:33.657
No more tears.
I'm a big boy.

23:33.691 --> 23:35.359
I did the crime,
I can do the time.

23:35.393 --> 23:37.561
But you didn't.
You got fucked.

23:37.595 --> 23:40.564
I fucked myself
a long, long time ago.

23:40.598 --> 23:46.270
Someone's feeling sorry
for himself.

23:46.304 --> 23:48.171
You know what that means?

23:48.206 --> 23:51.808
- Mm.
- You know what we got to do.

23:51.843 --> 23:53.744
- Oh, yeah.
- Pile up. Come on.

23:53.778 --> 23:54.745
Oh, we're doing that?

23:54.779 --> 23:56.847
Oh, oh! Ticklish.

23:57.982 --> 24:00.117
Spread your pussy.

24:00.151 --> 24:01.251
Watch the baby.

24:09.060 --> 24:13.096
You must be really baked.

24:13.131 --> 24:16.433
- Why do you say that?
- 'Cause you're dancing with me.

24:16.467 --> 24:18.602
- Mm-hmm.
- A convicted felon.

24:18.636 --> 24:21.405
Well, it must be true
what they say:

24:21.439 --> 24:23.473
There's someone for everyone.

24:23.508 --> 24:25.442
Well, thank you for today.

24:25.476 --> 24:27.377
Short of making sweet love to me,

24:27.412 --> 24:29.780
that was the nicest thing
you could've done for me.

24:29.814 --> 24:32.783
You're welcome.
It was fun.

24:32.817 --> 24:36.520
I mean, it's nice to escape
reality once in a while, right?

24:36.554 --> 24:40.123
Yeah.
I almost escaped today.

24:40.158 --> 24:42.192
I was driving.

24:42.226 --> 24:46.830
I just thought
about driving off.

24:46.864 --> 24:49.399
I know.

24:49.434 --> 24:50.867
How?

24:50.902 --> 24:52.502
Because you had that look
in your eye.

24:52.537 --> 24:54.338
Fight or flight.
You're right.

24:54.372 --> 24:56.940
I know everything there is
to know about you.

24:56.975 --> 25:01.178
- Lucky you.
- I am lucky.

25:01.212 --> 25:03.680
I'm lucky to have known you.

25:03.715 --> 25:07.284
I'm lucky to have loved you.

25:07.318 --> 25:12.289
But I feel it's finally...
it's finally over.

25:12.323 --> 25:16.793
Which is...
is kind of a relief.

25:19.030 --> 25:22.833
Over.

25:22.867 --> 25:24.901
You don't want me, Hank.

25:24.936 --> 25:28.538
Well, that's not true.

25:28.573 --> 25:30.741
- Isn't it?
- Mm-mm.

25:30.775 --> 25:34.211
Becca was right.
We were good together.

25:34.245 --> 25:36.813
We were happy.

25:36.848 --> 25:39.016
I thought
we were a fucking fairytale.

25:39.050 --> 25:41.418
But if you're careless
with something for long enough,

25:41.452 --> 25:43.353
you know, it breaks.

25:43.388 --> 25:47.157
And that's how I feel.
Broken.

25:47.191 --> 25:52.195
Completely and utterly broken.

25:54.599 --> 25:58.635
From the second that you told me
about Mia till now,

25:58.669 --> 26:01.471
it's... it's been a bad dream,
you know?

26:01.506 --> 26:07.444
I've been sleepwalking
through my life.

26:07.478 --> 26:10.547
And I can't do that anymore.
I can't live like that.

26:15.019 --> 26:18.855
I understand. I'll go.

26:18.890 --> 26:20.490
I didn't say I wanted you
to go.

26:20.525 --> 26:25.962
Karen, I don't get it.
What do you want from me?

26:25.997 --> 26:27.531
Something you can't give me.

26:27.565 --> 26:33.070
Something you've never
been able to give me.

26:33.104 --> 26:38.809
Something to look forward to.

26:38.843 --> 26:41.778
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

26:41.813 --> 26:43.113
It's not your fault.
It's mine.

26:43.147 --> 26:44.114
It's always been mine.

26:44.148 --> 26:45.382
That's not true.

26:45.416 --> 26:48.385
Don't say that.

26:48.419 --> 26:51.521
If you were gonna have sex
with someone and you knew

26:51.556 --> 26:56.993
that it would be the absolute
last time,

26:57.028 --> 27:00.897
what do you think
it would be like?

27:00.932 --> 27:03.200
I think it would be
incredibly sad.

27:03.234 --> 27:08.939
Yeah, so do I.

27:08.973 --> 27:11.541
Make me sad.

27:15.246 --> 27:25.081
