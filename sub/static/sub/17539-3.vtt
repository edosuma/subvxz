Mirror, Mirror,
what does our future hold?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.644
No. Gross!

00:18.644 --> 00:19.811
No.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.813
Ugh, that is so last year.

00:21.813 --> 00:24.441
‐That one looks nice.
‐Nice?

00:24.441 --> 00:26.693
The saying isn't
"Mirror, Mirror on the wall,

00:26.693 --> 00:28.570
who's the nicest of them all?"

00:28.570 --> 00:32.115
Ugh. Those VKs are getting
too much attention for my taste,

00:32.115 --> 00:33.742
and I have very good taste!

00:33.742 --> 00:36.495
I don't know, Audrey.
I kind of had to learn
the hard way

00:36.495 --> 00:38.038
that it's not all about
what you look like.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.624
Everybody's
so into their edgy VK style

00:40.624 --> 00:42.209
and dark‐colored everything!

00:42.209 --> 00:44.169
I don't think they're so into
their dark‐colored everything.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.755
‐They're so into‐‐
‐Their hair. Duhzies.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.965
When Mal changed your hair,

00:47.965 --> 00:50.884
you went from Plain Jane
to Kind‐of‐Plain Jane.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.428
‐Magic me.
‐I don't have magic.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.097
Your mom's
a fairy godmother!

00:55.097 --> 00:58.058
She and Maleficent are, like,
the most powerful people ever.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.185
If Mal has magic,
you have it too!

01:00.185 --> 01:02.312
I never really thought
about it that way.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.314
Do you remember
the spell that Mal did?

01:04.314 --> 01:06.066
For me,
she said "new hair,"

01:06.066 --> 01:08.527
but for Lonnie,
she said "cool hair."

01:08.527 --> 01:09.778
I'll take both!

01:09.778 --> 01:11.613
I want something
really out there.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.240
‐Go ahead.
‐I don't know...

01:13.240 --> 01:15.117
I really appreciate this.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.286
You're
a true friend, Jane.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.417
Beware, forswear,
replace the old with...

01:23.417 --> 01:25.043
something really out there?

01:28.714 --> 01:29.923
Whoa.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.966
Whoa!

01:32.259 --> 01:34.052
‐Do I look different?
‐Definitely.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.304
Is it edgy?

01:35.304 --> 01:36.430
It has edges.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.889
Yes!

01:37.889 --> 01:39.266
Post it!
