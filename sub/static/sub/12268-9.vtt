WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.573
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.573 --> 00:03.734
DANIEL IS ON
A DIGGING MISSION

00:03.734 --> 00:05.106
ABOUT MY FATHER INVESTING
IN NOLCORP.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.337
I'M THE C.F.O.,
AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME

00:06.337 --> 00:08.279
WHERE NEARLY
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS WENT.

00:08.279 --> 00:10.641
IT ALL WENT TO THE DAUGHTER
OF OUR FIRST INVESTOR,

00:10.641 --> 00:13.084
DAVID CLARKE.
 I WANT NO TIES WITH YOU.

00:13.084 --> 00:16.087
MEET MY BROTHER NATE.
THAT'S MY PARTNER IN THE BAR.

00:16.087 --> 00:18.389
THEY'RE GOOD GUYS.
 WELL, THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID
ABOUT THEIR OLD MAN.

00:18.389 --> 00:20.091
I'M GLAD YOU CAME
TO YOUR SENSES, PORTER.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.095
MATT, WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING? GIVE ME THE GUN.

00:24.095 --> 00:25.256
IT BELONGS TO YOU, ANYWAY.

00:25.256 --> 00:27.598
RYAN HAD IT COMING TO HIM.
YOU KNOW THAT!

00:27.598 --> 00:30.061
EMILY AND I HAVE A PLAN
TO INFILTRATE GRAYSON GLOBAL,

00:30.061 --> 00:31.262
TO DRAW OUT THE INITIATIVE.

00:31.262 --> 00:34.205
IF YOU'LL CONSIDER ME
AS A REPLACEMENT TO MY FATHER,

00:34.205 --> 00:36.167
WE WILL TRIPLE OUR NET WORTH
INSIDE A YEAR.

00:36.167 --> 00:37.508
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

00:37.508 --> 00:39.070
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME
PROTECT OUR SON.

00:39.070 --> 00:41.041
WE HAVE TO BLOCK HIM FROM
TAKING CONTROL OF THE BOARD,

00:41.041 --> 00:43.144
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

00:46.517 --> 00:48.419
(Emily) FOR THE RIGHTEOUS,

00:48.419 --> 00:52.123
A REVELATION
IS A JOYOUS EVENT,

00:52.123 --> 00:56.157
THE REALIZATION
OF A DIVINE TRUTH.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.291
BUT FOR THE WICKED,

01:00.291 --> 01:03.564
REVELATIONS CAN BE
FAR MORE TERRIFYING,

01:03.564 --> 01:06.167
WHEN DARK SECRETS ARE EXPOSED

01:06.167 --> 01:09.640
AND SINNERS ARE PUNISHED
FOR THEIR TRESPASSES.

01:12.803 --> 01:14.105
PULL!

01:14.105 --> 01:15.276
PULL!

01:15.276 --> 01:16.407
(machine clicks)

01:16.407 --> 01:18.109
PULL!

01:18.109 --> 01:19.450
PULL!
 (click)

01:20.781 --> 01:23.314
(South American accent)
 EXCELENTE, VICTORIA.

01:23.314 --> 01:24.485
WELL, AFTER MY KIDNAPPING,

01:24.485 --> 01:26.086
I DEVELOPED A FONDNESS
FOR FIREARMS.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.189
YOU BETTER NOT CROSS
THIS ONE, CONRAD.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.261
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

01:30.261 --> 01:31.362
PULL!

01:34.625 --> 01:36.127
YOU ARE OUT OF PRACTICE.

01:36.127 --> 01:39.300
YEAH, WELL, LEISURE TIME HAS
BEEN IN SHORT SUPPLY OF LATE.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.533
BUT ONCE I'M CLEAR OF THIS
ABSURD NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE

01:42.533 --> 01:44.405
DANIEL'S LAUNCHED AGAINST ME,
REST ASSURED,

01:44.405 --> 01:46.477
MY MARKSMANSHIP WILL RETURN.

01:46.477 --> 01:49.109
DANIEL'S TALK
OF DELIVERING NOLCORP

01:49.109 --> 01:50.611
IS A PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.813
OH, PLEASE. COME ON.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.216
EVEN IF DANIEL'S CORRECT
AND NOLCORP IS GRAYSON PROPERTY,

01:55.216 --> 01:57.188
NOLAN ROSS AND HIS PEOPLE
ARE GONNA DRAG THIS

01:57.188 --> 01:58.549
THROUGH THE COURTS FOR YEARS.

01:58.549 --> 02:00.521
TRUST ME, THIS IS NOT
THE GAME CHANGER

02:00.521 --> 02:02.193
MY SON BELIEVES IT TO BE.

02:02.193 --> 02:03.854
STILL, SOME ARE LISTENING.

02:03.854 --> 02:05.196
WELL, SOME ISN'T ENOUGH.

02:05.196 --> 02:07.758
THEY NEED A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY
TO OUST CONRAD.

02:07.758 --> 02:09.300
WHICH,
ASSUMING YOUR INFLUENCE

02:09.300 --> 02:11.202
OVER THE CORE MEMBERS
OF THE BOARD REMAINS ABSOLUTE,

02:11.202 --> 02:13.404
SHOULD PROVE
PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE.

02:13.404 --> 02:15.166
MY BLOCK WILL VOTE WITH ME,

02:15.166 --> 02:17.268
WHICHEVER WAY
I CHOOSE TO GO.

02:17.268 --> 02:18.138
(gun racks)

02:19.740 --> 02:21.272
DO ME THE HONOR?

02:21.272 --> 02:23.314
WITH PLEASURE, SALVADOR.
PULL!

02:23.314 --> 02:24.315
(click)

02:24.315 --> 02:25.616
SALVADOR GROBET--

02:25.616 --> 02:27.548
BRAZIL'S ANSWER
TO RICHARD BRANSON.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.621
ONLY RATHER THAN BUILDING HIS
FORTUNE BUSINESS BY BUSINESS,

02:30.621 --> 02:32.583
HE MARRIED INTO IT.

02:32.583 --> 02:35.286
HE AND CONRAD
CERTAINLY APPEAR COZY.

02:35.286 --> 02:36.787
GROBET HAS VOTED
CONRAD'S INTEREST

02:36.787 --> 02:38.158
IN EVERY MAJOR DECISION

02:38.158 --> 02:39.660
SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT
TO THE BOARD IN '99.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.192
UNLESS WE CHANGE THAT,

02:41.192 --> 02:43.464
YOU LOSE YOUR SHOT
AT A SEAT NEXT TO DANIEL.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.336
AND WITH IT, OUR INROAD
TO THE INITIATIVE.

02:45.336 --> 02:47.868
YOU THINK
WE CAN FLIP HIS VOTE?

02:47.868 --> 02:49.340
I THINK GROBET
IS A GREEDY BASTARD

02:49.340 --> 02:50.301
LIKE THE REST OF THEM.

02:50.301 --> 02:52.303
IF DANIEL DELIVERS NOLCORP,

02:52.303 --> 02:54.475
GROBET WILL DELIVER
THE BOARD.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.177
MM. SACRIFICIAL LAMB
REPORTING FOR THE SLAUGHTER.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.309
(inhales sharply)

02:58.309 --> 03:00.551
I WASN'T EXPECTING
AN ACTUAL FIRING SQUAD.

03:00.551 --> 03:03.254
LOOK, I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO
TO, UH, DO YOUR THING.

03:03.254 --> 03:04.415
MM.

03:04.415 --> 03:06.557
(woman) PULL!

03:06.557 --> 03:08.559
WELL, NOW THAT I'M
IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST,

03:08.559 --> 03:10.261
CARE TO EXPLAIN?

03:10.261 --> 03:11.722
I NEED
SALVADOR GROBET TO SEE

03:11.722 --> 03:13.424
THAT DANIEL'S ACQUISITION
OF NOLCORP

03:13.424 --> 03:14.925
ISN'T JUST A PIPE DREAM.

03:14.925 --> 03:16.397
YOUR BEING HERE
MAKES IT CREDIBLE.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.430
OH, IT'S MORE THAN CREDIBLE.
IT'S INEVITABLE.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.872
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR COMPANY, NOLAN.

03:21.872 --> 03:24.435
I KNOW HOW MUCH
IT MEANS TO YOU.
 YEAH.

03:24.435 --> 03:25.776
THE TRUTH IS, EMS,
I'VE BEEN WAITING

03:25.776 --> 03:28.239
FOR THIS SHOE TO DROP
FOR A WHILE NOW.

03:28.239 --> 03:32.543
BUT I'VE GOT A PLAN THAT SHOULD
HELP MITIGATE THE STING.

03:32.543 --> 03:34.415
MM. AND WHAT'S THAT?

03:34.415 --> 03:37.688
WELL, THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW,
AND YOU TO FIND OUT.

03:37.688 --> 03:38.849
(man) PULL!

03:38.849 --> 03:42.293
OH, HOW'S THAT FEEL?
NOT SO FUN, HUH?

03:42.293 --> 03:44.795
(chuckles) JUST BE CAREFUL.

03:44.795 --> 03:48.459
NOBODY PLAYS DIRTIER
THAN THE GRAYSONS.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.333
ALL RIGHT.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.306
GREAT, MR. DONOVAN. OKAY.
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

03:55.306 --> 03:56.937
BYE.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.769
(cell phone beeps)
 (Declan) THAT'S DAD'S
ADDRESS BOOK.

03:58.769 --> 04:00.671
YEAH, I'M INVITING, UH,
SOME OF HIS OLD CREW

04:00.671 --> 04:01.842
TO THE CHRISTENING.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.013
A LOT OF THESE GUYS
REALLY STEPPED UP

04:03.013 --> 04:04.345
WHEN HE DIED,

04:04.345 --> 04:06.016
TOLD ME
NOT TO BE A STRANGER.

04:06.016 --> 04:07.318
THAT'S NICE.

04:07.318 --> 04:09.550
ACTUALLY,
IT WAS KENNY'S IDEA.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.822
WELL, MINE AND NATE'S FATHER
DIED SUDDENLY, TOO.

04:11.822 --> 04:14.254
YOU KNOW,
WE MISS HIM EVERY DAY.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.688
AT LEAST LITTLE CARL'S
GODFATHER WILL BE THERE

04:17.688 --> 04:19.029
IN THE FLESH.

04:19.029 --> 04:20.531
OH, IS THAT ME?

04:20.531 --> 04:22.363
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WAITING
FOR BULL TO SAY YES.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.365
(laughs)
DON'T BE A DIPSTICK.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.666
DIPSTICK?

04:25.666 --> 04:28.268
WHOA. I CAN COME BACK
IF YOU TWO NEED A MINUTE.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.300
(laughs)

04:29.300 --> 04:31.642
ACTUALLY, I'M GLAD
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH HERE.

04:31.642 --> 04:34.305
YOU REALLY SAVED OUR HIDES
WITH THIS PLACE,

04:34.305 --> 04:38.579
AND I WAS HOPING YOU'D COME TO
MY SON'S CHRISTENING TOMORROW.

04:40.311 --> 04:42.413
YEAH, WE'D BE HONORED TO.

04:42.413 --> 04:44.515
LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING
SOME OF YOUR DAD'S OLD PALS,

04:44.515 --> 04:46.016
GET A SENSE OF THE HISTORY
OF THIS PLACE.

04:46.016 --> 04:47.388
RIGHT, NATE?

04:47.388 --> 04:48.689
ABSOLUTELY.

04:48.689 --> 04:52.022
IN FACT, OPEN BAR FOR ALL
YOUR GUESTS AFTER THE CEREMONY,

04:52.022 --> 04:53.394
ON US.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.865
(chuckles)

04:56.397 --> 04:59.330
(speaks indistinctly)

05:02.903 --> 05:04.435
(clay pigeon shatters)

05:04.435 --> 05:05.576
MR. GROBET,

05:05.576 --> 05:07.037
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:07.037 --> 05:08.539
PLEASE, DANIEL,

05:08.539 --> 05:11.512
YOU ARE CERTAINLY MAN ENOUGH
NOW TO CALL ME SALVADOR.

05:11.512 --> 05:15.686
AND WHO IS
THIS LOVELY BELLEZA?

05:15.686 --> 05:17.618
ASHLEY DAVENPORT.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.849
NICE MEETING YOU.

05:18.849 --> 05:20.020
THIS IS AIDEN MATHIS,

05:20.020 --> 05:21.922
SATOSHI TAKEDA'S LIAISON
TO OUR COMPANY.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.824
HE'S BEEN SPEARHEADING
THE NOLCORP ACQUISITION WITH ME.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.356
DESPITE WHAT CONRAD SAYS,

05:25.356 --> 05:27.458
I ASSUME NEGOTIATIONS
ARE GOING WELL.

05:27.458 --> 05:30.661
I SPOTTED YOU SPEAKING
WITH MR. ROSS EARLIER.

05:30.661 --> 05:32.863
YES, I, UH,
INVITED HIM LAST MINUTE.

05:32.863 --> 05:35.335
A LITTLE GLAD-HANDING
NEVER HURT A NEGOTIATION.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.509
MR. TAKEDA TAUGHT YOU WELL.

05:38.509 --> 05:40.371
WHERE'S YOUR WIFE TODAY,
SALVADOR?

05:40.371 --> 05:41.842
SADLY, MAGDA COULDN'T MAKE
THE TRIP.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.075
I'M AFRAID I'M LEFT
TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF.

05:45.075 --> 05:46.617
WELL, I WILL BE HAPPY
TO ORGANIZE ACTIVITIES

05:46.617 --> 05:47.948
TO FILL YOUR TIME.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.720
OH, I'D LOVE THAT,
MS. DAVENPORT.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.852
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TAKE A TURN, DANIEL?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.123
WHY NOT?

05:57.958 --> 06:00.030
(gun racks)

06:00.030 --> 06:01.692
PULL!

06:01.692 --> 06:02.863
(clicks)

06:02.863 --> 06:04.635
(gunshot)

06:09.670 --> 06:11.101
EMILY.

06:11.101 --> 06:12.873
SORRY. BAD ETIQUETTE.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.775
BUT AN IMPRESSIVE SHOT.
 MM.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.907
I SHOULD COME TO THE HAMPTONS
MORE OFTEN.

06:16.907 --> 06:18.549
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN SEEM TO FALL
FROM THE SKIES.

06:18.549 --> 06:20.951
OH, YOU'RE TOO KIND.

06:20.951 --> 06:23.083
SALVADOR GROBET,
EMILY THORNE.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.885
MS. THORNE IS CONSIDERING

06:24.885 --> 06:26.386
A SIZABLE INVESTMENT
IN GRAYSON GLOBAL.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.088
AND WHAT IS YOUR HESITATION?

06:28.088 --> 06:29.960
I'M A CAUTIOUS PERSON.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.962
AND AFTER CONRAD GRAYSON'S
ASSORTED PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENTS,

06:31.962 --> 06:34.425
I'D RATHER SEE SOMEONE
A LITTLE LESS...

06:34.425 --> 06:36.727
BURDENED AT THE HELM
BEFORE I OPEN MY CHECKBOOK,

06:36.727 --> 06:38.128
NAMELY DANIEL.

06:38.128 --> 06:41.532
BEAUTIFUL AND PRAGMATIC...

06:41.532 --> 06:42.903
A SPLENDID COMBINATION.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.006
WOULD YOU CARE
FOR A COLD DRINK,

06:46.006 --> 06:47.177
MR. GROBET?

06:47.177 --> 06:49.409
TAKE THE LEAD, PLEASE.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.682
NICE SHOT.

06:53.544 --> 06:54.815
YOUR AIM HAS IMPROVED.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.787
WELL, I TAUGHT HER
A THING OR TWO.

06:56.787 --> 06:58.919
THANKS FOR
THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.491
MR. GROBET'S APPROVAL IS KEY

07:00.491 --> 07:02.593
TO SECURING MY LEADERSHIP
AT THE COMPANY.

07:02.593 --> 07:04.655
I'M HAPPY TO HELP.

07:04.655 --> 07:06.757
HAVE A NICE DAY.

07:06.757 --> 07:08.659
(gun rattles)

07:08.659 --> 07:10.661
(gun clicks)

07:10.661 --> 07:13.564
(Conrad)
THERE'S A NICE TOUCH...

07:13.564 --> 07:14.865
TROTTING ASHLEY OUT,

07:14.865 --> 07:18.038
CONSIDERING SALVADOR'S PENCHANT
FOR EXOTIC WOMEN.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.010
I WOULD THINK HE'D HAVE BETTER
SELF-PRESERVATION INSTINCTS,

07:20.010 --> 07:21.942
SEEING AS HIS WIFE
HOLDS HIS FORTUNE.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.174
(cell phone rings)
 AH.

07:24.174 --> 07:26.116
(ring, beep)

07:26.116 --> 07:27.618
CONRAD.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.182
WE NEED TO DISCUSS
YOUR SON'S FUTURE.

07:32.182 --> 07:35.085
NO, WE DON'T.
DANIEL'S OF NO CONCERN TO YOU.

07:35.085 --> 07:37.457
OH, ON THE CONTRARY.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.458
AS THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD

07:38.458 --> 07:41.632
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL
APPEARS IMMINENT,

07:41.632 --> 07:45.135
YOUR USEFULNESS TO US
SEEMS TO HAVE RUN ITS COURSE.

07:45.135 --> 07:46.637
ALL RIGHT,
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

07:46.637 --> 07:47.798
I HAVE NO INTENTION

07:47.798 --> 07:49.469
OF RELINQUISHING CONTROL
OF MY COMPANY.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.471
YOU DEAL WITH ME
AND ONLY ME.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.673
You leave my son
out of this.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.606
IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT
THE VOTE SWINGS YOUR WAY,

07:55.606 --> 07:56.977
WE'RE WILLING TO RECONSIDER,

07:56.977 --> 07:58.248
BUT BE WARNED.

07:58.248 --> 08:01.481
If you attempt to alert
Daniel in any way

08:01.481 --> 08:03.483
to our resurgent relationship,

08:03.483 --> 08:07.818
YOUR SON WILL BE REMOVED FROM
THE EQUATION PERMANENTLY.

08:07.818 --> 08:09.960
Hello, Victoria.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.523
I SWEAR, YOU SO MUCH

08:12.523 --> 08:15.566
as lay a hand on my son,
and I will kill you myself!

08:15.566 --> 08:17.628
UNDERSTAND?!

08:17.628 --> 08:19.530
HELLO?

08:36.285 --> 08:38.118
(bell dings)

08:38.118 --> 08:40.821
PREPARE TO ENTER
THE LION'S DEN.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.157
OH, AND HERE COMES
LITTLE SIMBA NOW.

08:47.157 --> 08:49.960
NOLAN, MS. LAHARI, THANKS FOR
AGREEING TO THE MEETING.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.732
LET'S NOT MAKE THIS
ANY MORE UNPLEASANT

08:51.732 --> 08:52.863
THAN IT NEEDS TO BE.

08:52.863 --> 08:54.204
OH, UNPLEASANT? PSHAW.

08:54.204 --> 08:56.206
ISN'T IT EVERY MAN'S DREAM
TO GIVE OVER

08:56.206 --> 08:58.308
49% OF HIS COMPANY
TO A HOSTILE CONGLOMERATE?

08:58.308 --> 08:59.710
ACTUALLY,
NEW DETAILS HAVE EMERGED

08:59.710 --> 09:01.041
THAT ALTER THOSE TERMS.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.212
ARE WE ALL SET?

09:02.212 --> 09:03.614
EVERYTHING'S IN ORDER.

09:03.614 --> 09:06.977
I'M SORRY. UM... ASH.

09:06.977 --> 09:08.849
WHERE'S AIDEN MATHIS?

09:08.849 --> 09:10.781
HE'S THE ONE
I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH.

09:10.781 --> 09:12.683
AIDEN DOESN'T WORK
FOR THE COMPANY,

09:12.683 --> 09:13.724
NOT IN ANY OFFICIAL CAPACITY.

09:13.724 --> 09:15.055
AS A COURTESY TO YOU,

09:15.055 --> 09:16.827
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO DISCUSS THIS IN PRIVATE.

09:18.859 --> 09:22.132
I TRUST NO INTRODUCTION
IS NECESSARY.

09:24.094 --> 09:25.696
(Padma) WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:25.696 --> 09:27.567
WHO IS HE?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.139
UM...

09:29.139 --> 09:32.042
(lowered voice) WOULD YOU MIND
STEPPING OUTSIDE?

09:38.208 --> 09:40.811
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
MARCO?

09:40.811 --> 09:41.782
I INVITED HIM.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.113
AS NOLCORP'S FORMER C.F.O.,

09:43.113 --> 09:44.785
I THOUGHT MR. ROMERO
MIGHT HELP SHED SOME LIGHT

09:44.785 --> 09:46.657
ON YOUR COMPANY'S SOLVENCY.

09:46.657 --> 09:47.958
WHAT HE SHARED WITH ME,
HOWEVER,

09:47.958 --> 09:50.160
WAS A FAR MORE
INTERESTING STORY

09:50.160 --> 09:52.923
ABOUT A MISSING
$500-MILLION BANK ACCOUNT.

09:52.923 --> 09:54.224
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

09:54.224 --> 09:56.927
MARCO HERE CLAIMS HE SET UP
AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT FOR YOU

09:56.927 --> 09:58.769
AS A TAX SHELTER
BACK IN 2002--

09:58.769 --> 10:00.931
AN ACCOUNT THAT WAS
MYSTERIOUSLY DRAINED

10:00.931 --> 10:02.803
A WEEK BEFORE NOLCORP
WENT PUBLIC.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.304
DID HE TELL YOU
WHO THE MONEY WAS FOR?

10:04.304 --> 10:05.736
NO, ALL HE TOLD ME WAS THAT

10:05.736 --> 10:08.138
YOU HAD SOLE CONTROL
OVER THE ACCOUNT.

10:08.138 --> 10:09.379
FINE...

10:09.379 --> 10:10.881
DANNY.

10:10.881 --> 10:13.043
YOU WANT THE MONEY?
I'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK.

10:13.043 --> 10:14.214
OH, IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.046
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING INTEREST,
PENALTIES,

10:16.046 --> 10:18.218
AND A POTENTIAL
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.350
BUT I AM WILLING
TO FORGO ALL THAT

10:20.350 --> 10:23.623
IF WE CAN COME TO
A SWIFT AGREEMENT.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.696
51% CONTROLLING INTEREST
IN NOLCORP

10:25.696 --> 10:28.799
AND YOUR CONTINUED GOOD FAITH
SERVICES AS ITS C.E.O.

10:28.799 --> 10:30.931
AND VISIONARY.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.863
AND...

10:32.863 --> 10:34.404
IF I REFUSE?

10:34.404 --> 10:36.336
THEN I'LL DISPATCH AN ARMY
OF FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS

10:36.336 --> 10:39.710
TO HUNT DOWN EVERY MISSING PENNY
OF THAT $500 MILLION.

10:39.710 --> 10:40.841
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME,

10:40.841 --> 10:43.944
YOU DON'T WANT ME FINDING OUT
WHERE IT ENDED UP.

10:45.716 --> 10:48.348
WELL-PLAYED, BOSS.

10:48.348 --> 10:53.784
GUESS IT LOOKS LIKE
I WORK FOR GRAYSON GLOBAL NOW.

10:53.784 --> 10:56.086
SEE YOU AROUND, MARCO.

10:58.388 --> 11:02.162
(Ashley) SUCCESS SUITS YOU.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.295
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU
EVER LOOKING MORE DASHING.

11:05.295 --> 11:07.437
WALL STREET'S
NEW GOLDEN BOY.

11:07.437 --> 11:09.740
(chuckles) IT'S NOT LIKE
I DID IT ALONE.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.201
NOW THAT NOLCORP
IS SECURE,

11:11.201 --> 11:13.243
I CAN BRING AIDEN BACK IN.

11:13.243 --> 11:15.746
MR. GROBET SEEMED TO TAKE
A SHINE TO HIM.

11:15.746 --> 11:17.748
HE SHOULD BE THE ONE
TO DELIVER THE GOOD NEWS.

11:17.748 --> 11:19.209
NO, IT SHOULD BE YOU.

11:19.209 --> 11:21.912
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT FOUND
NOLAN'S FORMER C.F.O.

11:21.912 --> 11:24.084
AND YOU OBVIOUSLY
DIDN'T TRUST AIDEN ENOUGH

11:24.084 --> 11:26.686
TO INCLUDE HIM
IN THE FINAL NEGOTIATIONS.

11:29.119 --> 11:31.221
LISTEN, IF AIDEN'S GONNA BE
MY MAN ON THE BOARD,

11:31.221 --> 11:34.725
I WANT HIM BUILDING A RAPPORT
WITH ITS MOST POWERFUL MEMBER.

11:34.725 --> 11:35.866
BESIDES, WITHOUT HIM,

11:35.866 --> 11:38.028
I NEVER WOULD'VE CONNECTED
THE DOTS TO NOLCORP.

11:38.028 --> 11:40.901
AND HE WOULD BE THE FIRST
TO TELL YOU.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.233
DANIEL...

11:43.233 --> 11:45.335
I CAN'T SIT BACK
AND WATCH YOU GET PLAYED

11:45.335 --> 11:48.038
BY ANOTHER GRAYSON WANNABE.

11:48.038 --> 11:49.940
NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
WITH TYLER.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.441
REMEMBER HIM?

11:51.441 --> 11:54.484
I'VE SPENT THE PAST YEAR
TRYING TO FORGET HIM.
 MM.

11:54.484 --> 11:56.987
I'M ONLY SUGGESTING THAT
YOU TAKE THINGS SLOW WITH HIM,

11:56.987 --> 11:58.849
MAKE SURE
HE'S BEEN PROPERLY VETTED

11:58.849 --> 12:00.720
BEFORE HE GETS IN
ANY DEEPER.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.996
HELLO, LADY MACBETH.

12:05.996 --> 12:07.998
(cell phone rings)

12:07.998 --> 12:09.129
AH, RIGHT ON CUE.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.460
(ring, beep)

12:10.460 --> 12:12.102
EVENING, DANIEL.

12:12.102 --> 12:13.403
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

12:13.403 --> 12:14.935
NO, JUST GOING OVER
SOME DETAILS

12:14.935 --> 12:15.906
FOR YOUR PITCH
TO THE BOARD.

12:15.906 --> 12:16.967
UH, WHAT'S UP?

12:16.967 --> 12:18.308
LISTEN, GIVE YOURSELF
THE NIGHT OFF.

12:18.308 --> 12:19.910
I'LL TAKE LEAD
ON PREP FOR THE VOTE.

12:19.910 --> 12:22.372
When should we convene?

12:22.372 --> 12:23.914
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
ON THAT.

12:23.914 --> 12:27.047
BUT THANKS
FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.448
MY PLEASURE.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.820
(beep)

12:35.025 --> 12:37.057
ASHLEY'S TURNING DANIEL
AGAINST YOU.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.959
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?

12:41.161 --> 12:43.964
(typing)

12:45.966 --> 12:46.937
(laughs)

12:46.937 --> 12:48.098
(laughs)

12:48.098 --> 12:49.539
(moans)

12:49.539 --> 12:52.072
WE TURN DANIEL
AGAINST ASHLEY.

13:04.554 --> 13:05.886
OKAY, EMS.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.087
(sighs) I CAN'T SAY
YOU DIDN'T WARN ME

13:07.087 --> 13:08.788
ABOUT THAT
TRICKY LITTLE BASTARD.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.961
GOD, DANNY BOY REALLY LEARNED
HOW TO PLAY DIRTY.

13:10.961 --> 13:12.923
IT'S IN HIS D.N.A.

13:12.923 --> 13:14.094
IS THE VIDEO ENCRYPTED YET?

13:14.094 --> 13:16.196
UPLOADING NOW.
 (typing)

13:16.196 --> 13:17.497
AND...
 (beep)

13:17.497 --> 13:19.069
ADIOS, ASH.

13:19.069 --> 13:22.432
WHICH SHOULD PUT
YOUR PALE BRITISH SHADOW

13:22.432 --> 13:24.804
BACK IN DANNY'S
GOOD GRACES.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.977
(imitates British accent)
TOP OF THE MORNING, MATHIS.

13:26.977 --> 13:28.478
ROSS. LOOK,
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY

13:28.478 --> 13:29.809
WAS BEYOND REGRETTABLE.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.581
SO, UH, WE ALL GOT PLAYED.
MY APOLOGIES.

13:31.581 --> 13:33.984
(normal voice) YEAH, WELL,
JUST GET YOUR BOARD SEAT BACK

13:33.984 --> 13:36.816
SO I CAN PULL THE RIP CORD
ON MY GOLDEN PARACHUTE.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.988
(closes laptop)

13:37.988 --> 13:39.319
FYI, FILE'S UPLOADING NOW.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.121
IF SHE DOESN'T OPEN IT
IN FIVE MINUTES...

13:41.121 --> 13:44.094
(gasps)
IT OPENS ITSELF.

13:46.496 --> 13:47.998
OFF TO THE CHAPEL.

13:47.998 --> 13:49.159
COMING, EMS?

13:49.159 --> 13:50.560
SO...

13:50.560 --> 13:52.432
IN THE MIDST OF A MAELSTROM,

13:52.432 --> 13:54.164
YOU STILL HAVE TIME
FOR A CHRISTENING.

13:54.164 --> 13:56.336
WHO IS THIS PORTER FELLOW
TO YOU ANYWAY?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.068
AN OLD FRIEND.

13:58.068 --> 14:00.510
OLD FRIEND,
THAT ALL HE IS?

14:00.510 --> 14:02.212
COULD'VE BEEN SOMETHING MORE.

14:02.212 --> 14:04.344
AT... ONE POINT
ALMOST WAS.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.877
BUT IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

14:06.877 --> 14:09.519
ANOTHER CASUALTY
OF WHAT WE DO.

14:09.519 --> 14:13.183
(sighs)

14:13.183 --> 14:15.625
HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
SECRETS FROM ME.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.457
I'M NOT.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.530
IT'S OKAY IF YOU WANT TO,
BUT...

14:20.530 --> 14:22.492
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

14:24.094 --> 14:25.896
(exhales deeply) I KNOW.

14:25.896 --> 14:28.138
OLD HABITS.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.510
LOOK, I'LL BE, UH,

14:40.510 --> 14:42.882
RIGHT HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.885
(footsteps receding)

14:47.087 --> 14:48.588
MR. GROBET,
WHAT A LOVELY SURPRISE.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.090
AND FOR ME AS WELL.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.421
I ASSUME THAT
YOU SPOKE WITH DANIEL.

14:51.421 --> 14:53.593
I DID,
AND I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

14:53.593 --> 14:54.925
(Ashley)
GOOD. I'M PLEASED.

14:54.925 --> 14:56.666
MR. GROBET, I THOUGHT
I HEARD YOUR VOICE.

14:56.666 --> 14:58.128
YOU MUST BE LOOKING
FOR CONRAD.

14:58.128 --> 15:01.171
YES. I'M SORRY THAT
I DROPPED IN UNANNOUNCED.

15:01.171 --> 15:02.902
IS HE HOME?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.675
HE IS. HE'S IN HIS STUDY.
HE'LL BE THRILLED TO SEE YOU.

15:05.675 --> 15:07.307
WE'RE STILL ON TRACK,
I PRESUME.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.679
I SHOULD SPEAK
TO YOUR HUSBAND.

15:09.679 --> 15:11.211
MS. DAVENPORT.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.214
ALWAYS A PLEASURE,
MR. GROBET.

15:17.988 --> 15:20.390
(cell phone alert chimes)

15:20.390 --> 15:22.692
(beep)

15:22.692 --> 15:24.524
(heavy breathing)

15:24.524 --> 15:25.525
(laughs)

15:25.525 --> 15:27.197
(laughs)

15:27.197 --> 15:28.558
(moans and kisses)

15:33.333 --> 15:34.965
(priest) HEAVENLY FATHER,

15:34.965 --> 15:37.337
SURROUND THIS CHILD
WITH YOUR LOVE

15:37.337 --> 15:38.638
AND PROTECT HIM FROM EVIL.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.410
WHO ARE THE GODPARENTS?

15:40.410 --> 15:41.671
DECLAN FOSTER PORTER.

15:41.671 --> 15:43.473
EMILY REBECCA THORNE.

15:43.473 --> 15:46.646
(priest) DO YOU RENOUNCE SATAN
AND ALL HIS EMPTY PROMISES?

15:46.646 --> 15:48.648
DO YOU VOW TO PROTECT
THIS CHILD,

15:48.648 --> 15:52.082
TO STAVE OFF SIN,
AND SHIELD HIM FROM EVIL?

15:52.082 --> 15:53.253
PROMISE.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.085
PROMISE.

15:55.085 --> 15:57.427
(priest) PLEASE.

16:04.234 --> 16:05.595
I BAPTIZE THEE, CARL,

16:05.595 --> 16:07.397
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER,

16:07.397 --> 16:09.469
AND OF THE SON,

16:09.469 --> 16:12.672
AND OF THE HOLY GHOST.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.675
DEAREST FATHER IN HEAVEN,
BLESS THIS CHILD...

16:15.675 --> 16:18.978
(speaking indistinctly)

16:18.978 --> 16:22.012
SMILE UPON THIS CHILD
AND SURROUND THIS CHILD, LORD,

16:22.012 --> 16:24.754
WITH THE SOFT MANTLE
OF YOUR LOVE...

16:24.754 --> 16:26.256
(voice fades out)

16:37.997 --> 16:41.000
(speaking inaudibly)

16:53.783 --> 16:55.315
(Jack) MATT DUNCAN?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.016
(laughing) HEY.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.448
WHAT A SURPRISE, MAN.

16:58.448 --> 16:59.789
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

16:59.789 --> 17:02.052
I THOUGHT YOU MOVED
YOUR FAMILY DOWN TO FLORIDA.

17:02.052 --> 17:03.753
I-I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
ME CRASHING.

17:03.753 --> 17:05.194
AW, ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

17:05.194 --> 17:06.796
IT'S BEEN WAY TOO LONG.
 YEAH.

17:06.796 --> 17:09.299
(chuckles)

17:09.299 --> 17:11.560
(lowered voice) WHAT ARE
THE RYAN BROTHERS DOING HERE?

17:11.560 --> 17:13.203
OH, KENNY RYAN
BOUGHT IN TO THE BAR.

17:13.203 --> 17:14.763
YOU KNOW THOSE GUYS?

17:14.763 --> 17:17.166
YEAH, AND LISTEN TO ME,

17:17.166 --> 17:19.138
GET YOURSELF
OUT OF THAT DEAL.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.141
(chuckles)
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:21.141 --> 17:23.041
I WOULDA LOST THE BAR
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THEIR HELP.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.544
THEY DON'T HELP ANYBODY.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.715
AND THEY SURE AS HELL DIDN'T
COME TO YOUR BAR BY ACCIDENT.

17:26.715 --> 17:28.248
TRUST ME, JACK.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.820
GET 'EM OUT.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.683
(normal voice) SEE YOU AROUND,
KID. CONGRATS.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.295
LISTEN, I DON'T DENY

17:45.295 --> 17:46.796
THAT YOU HAVE HELPED
MAKE ME A VERY WEALTHY MAN.

17:46.796 --> 17:48.298
USING YOUR WIFE'S MONEY
TO DO IT.

17:48.298 --> 17:50.540
TELL ME, WHAT--WHAT CAN YOU
POSSIBLY NOT AFFORD

17:50.540 --> 17:53.072
THAT THESE NEWFOUND MILLIONS
MIGHT BRING YOU?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.204
GOOD QUESTION, CONRAD.

17:54.204 --> 17:55.845
PERHAPS I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU
TO FIND AN ANSWER.

17:55.845 --> 17:58.548
OH, WELL, THEN,
YOU'RE STILL PERSUADABLE?

17:58.548 --> 18:02.112
NOT BY ANYTHING
YOU POSSESS.

18:04.114 --> 18:07.257
(sighs)

18:07.257 --> 18:09.359
WELL?

18:09.359 --> 18:11.361
HE'S GOING WITH DANIEL.

18:11.361 --> 18:12.822
DON'T PRETEND FOR ONE SECOND

18:12.822 --> 18:16.196
THAT YOU GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT THAT BOY.

18:16.196 --> 18:19.329
A CLUE, PERHAPS, AS TO WHAT
THE HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

18:19.329 --> 18:21.731
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

18:21.731 --> 18:23.102
(beep)
 (panting and moaning)

18:23.102 --> 18:25.104
YOU HAVE WORMED YOUR WAY

18:25.104 --> 18:26.876
INTO THE VERY NADIR
OF REPUGNANCE.

18:26.876 --> 18:28.378
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

18:28.378 --> 18:30.380
FROM WHOEVER SEEMS TO BE
CIRCLING THIS FAMILY

18:30.380 --> 18:32.812
WITH AN ENDLESS CATALOG
OF OUR SINS.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.385

WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

27:29.018 --> 27:30.349
THEN WHAT IS IT EXACTLY,
HUH?

27:30.349 --> 27:32.822
OH, LET ME GUESS.
MY FATHER SENT YOU HERE

27:32.822 --> 27:34.183
TO SCREW GROBET FOR HIS VOTE,
DIDN'T HE?
 NO, NO, NO.

27:34.183 --> 27:36.325
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
 NO, NO! NO, THAT'S NOT--

27:36.325 --> 27:38.257
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING FOR HIM
THIS WHOLE TIME, HAVEN'T YOU?
 NO, NO, I HAVEN'T.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.929
NO, DANIEL, PLEASE LISTEN
TO ME. DANIEL, LISTEN. NO--
 SAVE IT. GET OFF OF ME!

27:39.929 --> 27:41.430
HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH!
 YOU DISGUST ME!

27:45.264 --> 27:46.435
HEY, PLEASE.
 (camera shutter clicks)

27:46.435 --> 27:48.037
YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

27:48.037 --> 27:49.769
UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO
HAND YOUR WIFE THE EASIEST,

27:49.769 --> 27:51.270
AND FOR YOU, THE COSTLIEST
DIVORCE IN HISTORY,

27:51.270 --> 27:53.402
YOUR VOTE IS MINE TOMORROW.

27:53.402 --> 27:56.375
GET YOUR STUFF
OUT OF MY HOUSE, ASHLEY.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.877
(cell phone rings)

27:57.877 --> 27:59.378
(ring)

27:59.378 --> 28:02.051
(ring, beep)

28:02.051 --> 28:03.312
HEY.

28:03.312 --> 28:05.254
Congratulations, Miss Thorne.

28:05.254 --> 28:06.385
I DO BELIEVE,
THIS TIME TOMORROW,

28:06.385 --> 28:09.058
GRAYSON GLOBAL WILL BE
CORONATING A NEW KING.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.128
(elevator bell dings)

28:19.128 --> 28:22.471
(indistinct conversations)

28:22.471 --> 28:24.003
OH, HEY, FRANCINE.

28:25.074 --> 28:26.375
EXCUSE ME.

28:26.375 --> 28:28.107
SALVADOR,

28:28.107 --> 28:30.980
I TRUST LAST NIGHT LEFT CONRAD
IN GOOD STANDING WITH YOU.

28:30.980 --> 28:32.411
UNFORTUNATELY
FOR YOUR HUSBAND,

28:32.411 --> 28:36.846
IT SEEMS DANIEL INHERITED
TWICE YOUR RUTHLESSNESS.

28:36.846 --> 28:38.147
I'LL SIDE WITH THE BOY,

28:38.147 --> 28:41.120
AND THOSE LOYAL TO ME
WILL FOLLOW.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.351
(speaks indistinctly)

28:46.826 --> 28:49.228
HE'S WON, HASN'T HE?

28:49.228 --> 28:50.930
YES.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.032
BUT WE HAVE ONE CARD
LEFT TO PLAY.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.163
WHAT, TELL HIM THE TRUTH?

28:54.163 --> 28:56.305
IT'D BE LIKE SIGNING
HIS DEATH WARRANT.

28:58.067 --> 29:00.069
DANIEL,
BEFORE YOU GO IN THERE,

29:00.069 --> 29:01.911
PLEASE GIVE US FIVE MINUTES.

29:01.911 --> 29:03.512
YOU'VE GOT TWO.

29:09.218 --> 29:10.749
I'VE KNOWN YOU TWO

29:10.749 --> 29:12.251
TO BE CAPABLE OF
SOME PRETTY VILE THINGS,

29:12.251 --> 29:13.752
BUT YOU'VE OUTDONE YOURSELVES
THIS TIME.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.025
NOW WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
HOLDING OVER ASHLEY

29:16.025 --> 29:18.487
THAT WOULD COMPEL HER
TO DEGRADE HERSELF LIKE THIS?

29:18.487 --> 29:21.030
WHATEVER ASHLEY DID OR DIDN'T DO
IS IRRELEVANT.

29:21.030 --> 29:22.361
THE TRUTH IS--
 THE TRUTH?

29:22.361 --> 29:23.993
(chuckles)
COMING FROM YOU?

29:25.194 --> 29:26.896
VICTORIA.

29:26.896 --> 29:28.197
THE TRUTH IS,

29:28.197 --> 29:31.100
THAT I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO PROTECT YOU.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.973
I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE
AMBITIOUS, BUT YOU ARE YOUNG.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.304
AND AS YOUR MOTHER,

29:35.304 --> 29:38.507
AS THE ONE PERSON WHO LOVES YOU
MORE THAN ANYONE IN THIS WORLD,

29:38.507 --> 29:40.249
I BESEECH YOU TO CALL OFF
THIS VOTE--

29:40.249 --> 29:41.811
AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

29:41.811 --> 29:45.284
WINNING THAT VOTE TODAY WILL
PUT YOU IN UNSPEAKABLE DANGER.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.286
FINE.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.358
TELL ME WHAT KIND OF DANGER
I'M IN.

29:49.358 --> 29:52.862
COME ON.
MAKE ME BELIEVE YOU.

29:56.265 --> 29:58.197
I CAN'T.

30:00.029 --> 30:02.131
AS EXPECTED.

30:02.131 --> 30:05.875
THE DEPTHS YOU'LL GO
TO STAY IN POWER ARE SHAMELESS.

30:08.577 --> 30:10.479
MR. DUNCAN.
 HEY, DECLAN.

30:10.479 --> 30:12.211
HEY.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.413
WE, UH, WE MISSED YOU
AT THE RECEPTION.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.145
YEAH, IT WAS
A BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY, THOUGH.

30:16.145 --> 30:17.316
YOUR DAD WOULD'VE BEEN PROUD.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.988
IS, UH, JACK AROUND?

30:18.988 --> 30:20.449
I THOUGHT I REMEMBERED
HE LIVED ON THE BOAT.

30:20.449 --> 30:22.151
YEAH. WELL, NO.

30:22.151 --> 30:24.193
N--I LIVE HERE NOW,
EVER SINCE THE BABY CAME.

30:24.193 --> 30:25.324
AH.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.196
DID YOU CHECK THE BAR?
HE'S PROBABLY JUST OPENING UP.

30:27.196 --> 30:28.327
OH, YEAH. RIGHT.
I'LL DO THAT.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.929
IT'S JUST--IT, UM...

30:29.929 --> 30:31.830
ARE HIS BUSINESS PARTNERS
AROUND?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.062
NATE AND KENNY?

30:33.062 --> 30:34.233
YEAH.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.264
SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

30:35.264 --> 30:37.136
WANT ME TO WALK UP
WITH YOU?

30:38.567 --> 30:40.269
KNOW WHAT?

30:40.269 --> 30:41.871
I LEFT THE BABY'S GIFT
IN THE BACKSEAT.

30:41.871 --> 30:43.943
I-I GOTTA GO GET IT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.314
(whispers) OKAY.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.193
WELL, WELL. HEY, KENNY.
LOOK WHO IT IS.

31:04.193 --> 31:05.234
YOU REMEMBER MATT DUNCAN.

31:05.234 --> 31:06.896
SURE DO.

31:06.896 --> 31:09.368
BEEN A LONG TIME.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.100
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO YOU BOYS.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.271
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.103
WE GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS
FOR YOU,

31:14.103 --> 31:16.545
MAINLY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR OLD MAN SIX YEARS AGO.

31:16.545 --> 31:18.407
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

31:18.407 --> 31:20.109
SEE, WE DON'T BELIEVE
THAT'S TRUE.

31:20.109 --> 31:21.380
YOU KNOW WHY?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.082
'CAUSE THE LAST THING
HE SAYS TO US WAS,

31:23.082 --> 31:26.385
HE HAD A MEETING RIGHT HERE
WITH YOUR OLD PAL CARL PORTER.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.057
SAME NIGHT YOUR KID
WAS SIDESWIPED BY A CAR.

31:28.057 --> 31:30.059
AFTER THAT, WE NEVER
HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN.

31:30.059 --> 31:32.291
I SPENT THAT NIGHT
IN THE HOSPITAL.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.423
THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY,
IS IT?

31:34.423 --> 31:36.966
TELL YOU WHAT. WHY DON'T WE
GO SETTLE THIS LIKE MEN?

31:36.966 --> 31:40.299
SEE IF I CAN'T FIND A WAY
TO JOG YOUR MEMORY.

31:42.171 --> 31:43.302
(bell dings)

31:46.575 --> 31:48.077
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

31:49.979 --> 31:51.310
IT'S OVER.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.381
(speaks inaudibly)

31:52.381 --> 31:55.985
(kisses) SALVADOR VOTED
WITH DANIEL,

31:55.985 --> 31:57.246
AND THE BOARD DID THE SAME.

31:57.246 --> 31:59.388
SO IT'S OFFICIAL.

31:59.388 --> 32:01.250
HE'S THE NEW C.E.O.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.025
MR. GROBET,

32:06.025 --> 32:07.296
THANK YOU FOR YOUR VOTE.

32:09.358 --> 32:12.231
(lowered voice) I SUGGEST
YOU SMILE AND SHAKE MY HAND.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.462
IN ADDITION TO NOLCORP,

32:13.462 --> 32:15.164
MY OTHER ACQUISITION TODAY
WAS YOUR LOYALTY.

32:15.164 --> 32:16.365
DON'T FORGET THAT.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.069
(pats arm)
 ALL RIGHT.

32:22.471 --> 32:24.443
EMILY, WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.976
DANIEL, I HEAR
CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.

32:26.976 --> 32:28.447
OH, THANK YOU.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.079
I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND
MY CALLING.

32:30.079 --> 32:31.550
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THE CITY?

32:31.550 --> 32:33.382
ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST HOPING
TO STEAL AIDEN FOR A BIT.

32:33.382 --> 32:34.683
WELL, HE'S YOUR MAN.

32:34.683 --> 32:37.086
I JUST NEED HIM
FOR TWO SECONDS.

32:37.086 --> 32:38.487
ABSOLUTELY.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.732
VICTORIA, CONRAD.

32:43.732 --> 32:45.464
I BET YOU'RE SO PROUD.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.236
I KNOW I AM.

32:50.199 --> 32:51.540
CONGRATULATIONS
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

32:51.540 --> 32:53.442
AIDEN, I COULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

32:53.442 --> 32:54.573
THANK YOU.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.275
WHICH MAKES
THIS BIT OF BAD NEWS

32:56.275 --> 32:58.477
ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT
TO DELIVER.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.409
MY LEADERSHIP WAS NOT
THE ONLY PIECE OF NEW BUSINESS

33:00.409 --> 33:02.011
THAT CAME TO PASS TODAY.

33:02.011 --> 33:04.013
THE BOARD ALSO ELECTED
TO CLOSE RANKS

33:04.013 --> 33:06.315
WHILE THE COMPANY
GOES THROUGH THIS TRANSITION.

33:06.315 --> 33:08.217
MEANING?

33:08.217 --> 33:09.518
MEANING THERE'S NO ROOM FOR YOU
ON THE BOARD

33:09.518 --> 33:11.490
UNLESS SOMEONE
WILLINGLY VACATES,

33:11.490 --> 33:14.293
AND I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING
ANYTIME SOON,

33:14.293 --> 33:15.424
AS THE NOLCORP DEAL

33:15.424 --> 33:17.496
JUST INCREASED
OUR BOTTOM LINE BY 30%.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.229
BUT, HEY,
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

33:20.229 --> 33:21.470
I'M SURE THIS WILL COME

33:21.470 --> 33:23.232
AS A CONSIDERABLE RELIEF
TO MR. TAKEDA,

33:23.232 --> 33:25.704
WHO'S JUST REGAINED
YOUR FULL ATTENTION.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.476
HAVE FUN WITH EMILY TODAY.

33:27.476 --> 33:30.079
YEAH.

33:32.311 --> 33:33.642
HEY.

33:33.642 --> 33:35.684
HE'S FINALLY DOWN.

33:35.684 --> 33:37.616
WHAT YOU LOOKIN' FOR?

33:37.616 --> 33:39.618
MY DAD'S ADDRESS BOOK

33:39.618 --> 33:42.020
SO I CAN SEND OUT THANK-YOUS
FOR ALL THE CHRISTENING GIFTS.
 (cell phone rings)

33:42.020 --> 33:43.322
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?
 (ring)

33:43.322 --> 33:44.753
NO. DID YOU ASK DECLAN?
 (ring)

33:44.753 --> 33:47.226
(beep)
 NO. HEY, MAN.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.427
JACK.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.429
LOOK, I AM SORRY TO BE
THE BEARER OF TROUBLING NEWS,

33:50.429 --> 33:52.161
BUT I DID THAT RESEARCH

33:52.161 --> 33:54.433
you asked for
on your new business partners.

33:54.433 --> 33:57.236
DOES THE NAME JOE RYAN
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

33:57.236 --> 33:58.537
WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.140
ARE--ARE YOU SAYING THEY'RE
RELATED TO THAT JOE RYAN?

34:01.140 --> 34:02.441
I AM TELLING YOU,
HE'S THEIR FATHER.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.773
I DUG UP AN ARTICLE
FROM NOVEMBER OF '06.

34:04.773 --> 34:07.116
His body washed up
on Gin Beach. He'd been--

34:07.116 --> 34:08.417
SHOT TO DEATH.
I KNOW.

34:08.417 --> 34:10.418
THEY NEVER FOUND
THE PERSON WHO DID IT.
 Yeah, well,

34:10.418 --> 34:11.719
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR NEW BUDDY NATE

34:11.719 --> 34:13.522
TOOK A PAGE
FROM DAD'S PLAYBOOK.

34:13.522 --> 34:15.524
HE JUST WRAPPED UP
A 5-YEAR VACAY AT RIKERS

34:15.524 --> 34:17.286
FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING.

34:17.286 --> 34:18.427
And as for Kenny,

34:18.427 --> 34:20.289
the guy doesn't own a house
in Southampton.

34:20.289 --> 34:22.831
He sublets a 1-bedroom
in Sag Harbor.

34:22.831 --> 34:24.433
Jack, these guys

34:24.433 --> 34:26.094
ARE SERIOUSLY BAD DUDES.

34:26.094 --> 34:27.466
(door opens)

34:27.466 --> 34:28.766
THERE'S A MAN OUT THERE

34:28.766 --> 34:30.639
covered in blood.
I think he's dying.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.440
I-I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.
 Jack--

34:32.440 --> 34:33.442
STAY WITH THE BABY!

34:33.442 --> 34:34.603
NO, JACK--

34:34.603 --> 34:36.275
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.
COME ON. STAY AWAKE.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.505
STAY UP. COME ON.
 MR. DUNCAN!

34:37.505 --> 34:38.407
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:38.407 --> 34:39.578
I DON'T KNOW.
I FOUND HIM LIKE THIS.

34:39.578 --> 34:40.748
(Charlotte) IS HE DEAD?
 NO.

34:40.748 --> 34:42.481
KEEP HIM CONSCIOUS.
I'M CALLING 9-1-1.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.612
NO.

34:43.612 --> 34:45.154
NO COPS.

34:45.154 --> 34:46.215
GET HER OUTTA HERE.

34:46.215 --> 34:47.686
CHARLOTTE, COME ON.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.618
(panting) THE--THE RYANS...

34:49.618 --> 34:51.219
THEY DID THIS TO YOU?

34:51.219 --> 34:52.591
THEIR OLD MAN, THEY...

34:52.591 --> 34:56.094
THINK YOUR DAD KILLED HIM.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.596
THAT'S CRAZY.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.868
MY DAD WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

34:59.868 --> 35:02.671
HE DIDN'T. I DID.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.306
I USED HIS GUN.

35:07.306 --> 35:10.879
HE HID IT ON YOUR BOAT
TO PROTECT ME.

35:12.281 --> 35:14.813
THEY'RE NOT
YOUR FRIENDS, JACK.

35:14.813 --> 35:18.187
THEY WANT PAYBACK.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.330
NEEDLESS TO SAY,

35:31.330 --> 35:34.763
YOU WERE RIGHT TO KEEP DANIEL
IN THE DARK THIS AFTERNOON.

35:34.763 --> 35:37.536
THE BOY WILL SOON RUN
THE COMPANY TOWARD THE GROUND,

35:37.536 --> 35:40.138
PROVING LITTLE USE
TO THE INITIATIVE.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.670
ON THE CONTRARY.

35:41.670 --> 35:43.842
I THINK HE HANDLED HIMSELF
VERY WELL TODAY.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.814
SEEMINGLY.

35:45.814 --> 35:47.246
BUT HIS VAULTING AMBITION

35:47.246 --> 35:51.620
WILL BRING HIM DOWN AS SWIFTLY
AS IT PROPPED HIM UP.

35:51.620 --> 35:53.252
(slaps)
 (chuckles)

35:53.252 --> 35:55.854
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?

35:55.854 --> 35:58.427
TAKE YOUR PICK.

36:11.800 --> 36:15.304
(door opens)

36:15.304 --> 36:16.845
(Kenny) EVENING, JACK.

36:16.845 --> 36:18.207
(door closes)

36:18.207 --> 36:20.579
THOUGHT WE SHOULD
CHECK ON YOU GUYS.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.552
HEARD THERE WAS
A LITTLE INCIDENT EARLIER.

36:23.552 --> 36:24.853
YEAH.

36:24.853 --> 36:26.184
(sets glass down)

36:26.184 --> 36:28.257
DECIDED TO CLOSE UP EARLY.
PEOPLE WERE PRETTY SPOOKED.

36:28.257 --> 36:29.858
YEAH. LOOKS LIKE IT.

36:29.858 --> 36:32.391
IS IT TRUE SOME OLD-TIMER
NEARLY BOUGHT IT OUT THERE?

36:32.391 --> 36:34.893
SOME FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S
OR SOMETHING?

36:34.893 --> 36:36.495
MATT DUNCAN.

36:37.866 --> 36:40.729
LUCKILY I GOT HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL IN TIME.

36:40.729 --> 36:42.971
YEAH, LUCKY FOR HIM.
YOU'RE A GOOD SAMARITAN, JACK.

36:44.433 --> 36:47.606
MOST PEOPLE
WOULDN'T GET INVOLVED.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.708
DID HE SAY WHO DID IT?

36:49.708 --> 36:52.911
NO. NEVER SAW 'EM.
HE GOT JUMPED FROM BEHIND.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.844
GUESS WE SHOULD ALL
KEEP OUR EYES OPEN THEN.

36:55.844 --> 36:57.986
YEAH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,

36:57.986 --> 36:59.688
I ACCIDENTALLY PICKED UP
YOUR POP'S BLACK BOOK

36:59.688 --> 37:01.350
OFF THE BAR TODAY.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.452
(laughs) HE--

37:03.452 --> 37:06.425
HE'S A REAL POPULAR GUY,
YOUR OLD MAN, HUH?

37:08.697 --> 37:11.229
THAT WAS
A NICE CHRISTENING TODAY.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.801
SLEEP TIGHT.

37:14.963 --> 37:17.866
(door closes)

37:17.866 --> 37:19.368
JACK...

37:19.368 --> 37:20.869
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:20.869 --> 37:22.471
NOTHING.

37:22.471 --> 37:23.942
GO BACK TO BED.

37:29.918 --> 37:32.981
LOCK THE DOORS.
I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE.

37:38.887 --> 37:40.959
LAST ONE.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.292
GOOD.

37:43.292 --> 37:45.334
MY HAND IS CRAMPING.
 (cracks knuckles)

37:45.334 --> 37:46.835
SO IT'S DONE.

37:46.835 --> 37:49.798
WE'RE AN OFFICIAL SUBSIDIARY
OF GRAYSON GLOBAL.

37:49.798 --> 37:51.540
YEAH, WELL, FORGIVE ME
IF I DON'T FEEL LIKE

37:51.540 --> 37:53.902
CRACKING OPEN
THE CHAMPAGNE. MM.

37:53.902 --> 37:56.004
NOLAN, I'M SORRY.

37:56.004 --> 37:57.306
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE.

37:57.306 --> 37:58.707
DON'T.

37:58.707 --> 38:02.311
REMEMBER WHEN I ASKED YOU
HOW FAR YOU'D BE WILLING TO GO

38:02.311 --> 38:05.884
TO DEFEND THIS COMPANY?

38:05.884 --> 38:09.788
FIRST RULE OF DIRTY DEALING,
ALWAYS HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN

38:09.788 --> 38:11.460
THAT BITES YOUR OPPONENT
IN THE ASS

38:11.460 --> 38:13.061
HARDER THAN THEY BIT YOU.

38:13.061 --> 38:14.793
WHAT KIND OF PLAN?

38:14.793 --> 38:17.466
JUST KNOW THAT
I HAVE NO INTENTION

38:17.466 --> 38:20.899
OF LETTING THOSE BASTARDS
PROFIT OFF DAVID CLARKE.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.432
BUT WHY WAIT?
WHY NOT HIT THEM NOW?

38:23.432 --> 38:27.436
IT'S MUCH EASIER TO DESTROY
A CASTLE FROM INSIDE ITS WALLS.

38:27.436 --> 38:29.778
HUH. SUDDENLY I'VE BECOME--

38:29.778 --> 38:30.979
A TROJAN HORSE.

38:30.979 --> 38:32.511
OH, WHEN I'M FINISHED,

38:32.511 --> 38:34.413
YOUNG DANIEL
WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT HIM.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.584
(door opens)

38:35.584 --> 38:37.586
ALWAYS BURNING
THE MIDNIGHT OIL.

38:37.586 --> 38:38.747
SHOULD I CALL SECURITY?

38:38.747 --> 38:41.490
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
NOLAN.

38:41.490 --> 38:43.692
UM, PADMA...

38:43.692 --> 38:45.824
MARCO AND I ARE...

38:45.824 --> 38:47.095
IN TALKS

38:47.095 --> 38:49.928
TO FIND HIM A POSITION
WITHIN THE COMPANY.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.530
WHAT?

38:51.530 --> 38:53.432
AFTER WHAT HE DID?

38:53.432 --> 38:55.333
THAT'S INSANE.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.906
ACTUALLY,
IT'S JUST SMART BUSINESS.

38:57.906 --> 39:00.008
RIGHT, NOLAN?

39:09.077 --> 39:11.750
(sighs)

39:17.956 --> 39:22.060
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE

39:22.060 --> 39:23.992
FOR PEOPLE LIKE US
TO EVER BE--

39:23.992 --> 39:26.635
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?

39:26.635 --> 39:30.599
I WAS GONNA SAY "HAPPY."

39:30.599 --> 39:33.071
MAYBE NOT COMPLETELY.

39:34.803 --> 39:37.005
BUT RIGHT NOW I'M HAPPY.

39:40.078 --> 39:44.082
BEING WITH YOU IS THE ONLY TIME
I'VE EVER FELT PEACE.
