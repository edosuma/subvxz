Alright, I got Vince a bottle
of that bug spray

00:07.746 --> 00:09.966
he calls cologne and mom a set
of crystal wine glasses.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.490
I don't know why you blow money
on expensive wine glasses.

00:12.577 --> 00:15.667
I've seen her drink Chardonnay
out of a cereal bowl.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.756
I've seen her suck it off
a blouse she spilled it on

00:17.843 --> 00:20.150
but those glasses
are more for guests.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.934
Does this mean
we're done shopping?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.198
'Cause if I hear the Chipmunks
sing another Christmas song

00:24.285 --> 00:26.896
I'm setting myself on fire.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.898
I'm almost done.

00:28.985 --> 00:31.248
I still have to get something
for Carl, Samuel and Kevin.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.902
- Who's Kevin?
- Our mailman.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.338
You call the mailman Kevin?

00:34.425 --> 00:36.079
That's his name.
What do you call him?

00:36.166 --> 00:38.212
I call him the jerk who stole
my "Sports Illustrated"

00:38.299 --> 00:40.040
swimsuit edition.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.519
He doesn't steal any of my mail

00:41.606 --> 00:43.478
because I buy him
a nice Christmas gift.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.610
Well, we shouldn't
have to bribe civil servants

00:45.697 --> 00:47.438
to get them to do their jobs.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.832

who accepts a free meal

00:49.919 --> 00:51.442

I'm just saying, friends
and family are one thing

01:03.324 --> 01:06.718
but let Santa cover the meter

01:06.805 --> 01:10.113
I know, but it's Christmas.
Don't be such a grumpy Grinch.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.463
I'm sorry, ma'am,
your card's been declined.

01:12.550 --> 01:15.553
Oh, I don't,
I don't think it is, Debbie.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.252
I just used it at Brookstone
and Williams-Sonoma.

01:18.339 --> 01:21.342
Maybe just rub it on your shirt
and give it another swipe.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.866
I mean, I know it's the credit
card company just being

01:23.953 --> 01:26.303
overly cautious,
and I know it's to protect me

01:26.390 --> 01:29.001
but it's kind of a pain
in the rump, right?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.829
Declined.

01:30.916 --> 01:33.963
- Did you pay the bill?
- Of course, I paid the bill.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.617
No biggie, no biggie.

01:35.704 --> 01:39.490
Plenty of,
plenty of other cards.

01:39.577 --> 01:42.537
If you could just
spread that over those three

01:42.624 --> 01:45.279
we'll be right as rain.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.107
I don't think
I'm allowed to do that.

Oh, they don't give those
name tags to cowards, Debbie.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.027
Molly, there's a lot
of people waiting.

I feel their horrible stares.

I do it all the time.

just extending the problem.

about this later?

to pay for all those toys

thank you for bringing

Your son's birthday.

seeing your boy for 33 years
