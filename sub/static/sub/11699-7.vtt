WEBVTT

00:00.312 --> 00:02.158
Whoo!

00:02.159 --> 00:03.874
Enjoying your flight today, Emma?

00:03.875 --> 00:06.547
Just warn me if we're
heading for Aca-puko, okay?

00:07.689 --> 00:10.631
- Knock-knock! Danny?
- Riley, hi.

00:10.632 --> 00:12.469
Ben, don't bother. I'm not talking to you.

00:12.470 --> 00:15.018
But if I were I'd be saying, "I
can't believe you slept with Heather."

00:15.019 --> 00:16.795
- Listen, listen, I'm so sorry.
- Really, I don't need to...

00:16.796 --> 00:18.198
- just hear me out.
- I don't wanna hear the whole thing!

00:18.199 --> 00:19.579
- It's really not necessary!
- Just shut up already!

00:20.886 --> 00:22.438
I'm trying to apologize here.

00:23.076 --> 00:25.476
Listen, I am so sorry I slept with Heather.

00:25.477 --> 00:26.624
If I knew you hated her,

00:26.625 --> 00:27.926
I would've done the right thing...

00:28.228 --> 00:29.899
I would've snuck her out the fire escape.

00:32.301 --> 00:34.023
- Is your brother here or not?
- Not.

00:34.024 --> 00:35.466
- Okay.
- No no, Riley, wait wait wait.

00:35.467 --> 00:36.974
Please please please. I promise you

00:36.975 --> 00:39.201
I will never ever hook
up with Heather again.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.444
Well, you couldn't even if you wanted to,

00:41.445 --> 00:43.472
so not really that big of a sacrifice.

00:44.814 --> 00:47.326
Oh...  I could.

00:48.238 --> 00:50.816
She was into me, but I'm choosing not to,

00:50.817 --> 00:52.408
because I'm just that kinda guy.

00:53.951 --> 00:55.837
Oh. Well, sorry to burst your man-bubble,

00:55.838 --> 00:58.224
but Heather only used
you to get even with me.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.653
And it just helped that you
have no morals or integrity.

01:01.677 --> 01:03.276
- Oh? Really? Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

01:03.277 --> 01:07.184
Would a woman... Who
never wants to see me again

01:07.185 --> 01:08.844
leave an earring?

01:10.012 --> 01:11.608
She's practically moving in!

01:12.831 --> 01:15.899
Oh. Okay. Whatever you say, yeah.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.354
Well, I say I could go out with
her again any time I wanted to.

01:18.355 --> 01:20.452
Well, I say I challenge you.

01:20.453 --> 01:21.839
Oh, really? Are we gonna go there?

01:21.840 --> 01:23.267
Oh, I think we're already there.

01:23.268 --> 01:25.532
Fine. I bet I can go on a date with Heather

01:25.533 --> 01:28.643
- in the next 48 hours.
-  And I accept that bet.

01:28.644 --> 01:32.780
- Should we wager the usual?
- How about the usual deluxe?

01:33.479 --> 01:35.272
Ho ho.

01:37.743 --> 01:39.580
Oh man.

01:39.947 --> 01:41.471
Oh, this is gonna be good.

01:41.472 --> 01:43.198
Okay.

01:44.410 --> 01:46.497
Hey, what's up, Heather? It's Ben.

01:47.634 --> 01:48.976
Wheeler.

01:51.550 --> 01:53.120
We had sex.

01:54.601 --> 01:56.338
Heather? Heather!

01:58.658 --> 02:00.103
She's gonna call me back.

02:12.974 --> 02:15.664
Dude, any ideas? I need to
get the date with Heather

02:15.665 --> 02:17.747
or I'm gonna be on the wrong
end of the usual deluxe,

02:18.802 --> 02:21.202
<i>and I am not shaving off my eyebrows...</i>

02:22.552 --> 02:23.848
Again.

02:24.857 --> 02:27.218
Well, I think your best bet
is to go build a time machine

02:27.219 --> 02:30.325
and go back to a time...
Before you were an idiot.

02:31.487 --> 02:34.459
All right. Well, I am off
to the park to meet a lady.

02:34.460 --> 02:37.112
All I need is a bottle, a binky and a baby.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.506
Do you ever wonder why you're
single? Because I don't.

02:41.775 --> 02:45.478
Ever why you're folding onesies
while I'm going to pick up a girl?

02:46.226 --> 02:47.845
Because I don't.

02:48.579 --> 02:50.756
Dude, are you using
Emma to meet women again?

02:50.757 --> 02:51.865
Yes.

02:53.163 --> 02:54.757
And I also use her

02:54.758 --> 02:56.713
to cut through long bathroom lines.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.734
Sorry, Tucker, but
Emma's gonna get me a date

03:00.051 --> 03:02.269
and help me win a bet. Okay, baby,

03:02.270 --> 03:04.230
time to earn your formula. Whoo!

03:05.816 --> 03:07.048
Onesie?

03:08.886 --> 03:09.998
Boys...

03:11.009 --> 03:12.635
I'm having a crisis.

03:13.513 --> 03:15.321
Is it a real crisis or the
kind where you just need

03:15.322 --> 03:17.163
a glass of chardonnay to cheer you up?

03:18.145 --> 03:20.194
No, but thanks for the reminder.

03:21.533 --> 03:24.140
Okay, after much soul-searching,

03:24.141 --> 03:28.252
I've decided that I've
gotta break up with Brad.

03:28.253 --> 03:32.031
You know, he's just too young and immature.

03:32.032 --> 03:34.601
It turns out once we have our clothes on,

03:34.602 --> 03:36.085
we have nothing in common!

03:37.269 --> 03:39.522
But, mom, Brad's awesome!

03:39.523 --> 03:42.619
He likes to play air hockey, he
always lets me win at "Dino Hunter IV"

03:42.620 --> 03:45.754
and he's got the entire secret
menu memorized at the Burger Barn.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.494
And you wanna know why I'm single?

03:50.052 --> 03:52.430
Mom, if you dump him, he'll dump me.

03:52.431 --> 03:54.409
I broke up with your friend Jimmy Balding

03:54.410 --> 03:56.978
- and he didn't dump you.
- You dated Jimmy Balding?!

03:56.979 --> 03:58.744
No! Who said that?! No.

03:59.247 --> 04:01.853
Okay, I just need to think of the best way

04:01.854 --> 04:04.975
to break up with Brad
without hurting his feelings.

04:04.976 --> 04:07.887
I got you covered. Fake move to Mexico.

04:07.888 --> 04:08.977
Yes.

04:10.001 --> 04:12.211
I got a guy who will
send a postcard for you.

04:12.212 --> 04:13.707
- Oh.
- Yeah.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.252
Just ask for Bonifacio.

04:19.964 --> 04:22.270
- It's him.
- Bonifacio?

04:25.698 --> 04:27.244
- Brad.
- Oh.

04:27.245 --> 04:28.634
Okay, you know what?

04:28.635 --> 04:30.845
I think that I'm just
gonna get it over with.

04:30.846 --> 04:32.953
Okay?

04:32.954 --> 04:35.090
Hey, Brad. Look...

04:35.639 --> 04:38.546
You what? Okay, I'll be right there!

04:38.547 --> 04:40.529
He's in the hospital!

04:41.129 --> 04:43.881
Why does bad stuff always happen to me?!

04:49.476 --> 04:51.584
Oh my God, Brad. Are you okay?

04:51.585 --> 04:54.286
- Dude, what happened?
- Well, I was showing the new Brad pad

04:54.287 --> 04:57.745
and the last thing I remember were the
elevator doors just closing in on my head.

04:58.364 --> 05:01.526
Thankfully, the face is fine.

05:02.560 --> 05:03.748
Don't worry. A few more tests

05:03.749 --> 05:05.920
and this whole thing will
be over before you know it.

05:05.921 --> 05:09.221
Speaking of things that are gonna
be over before you know it...

05:09.222 --> 05:12.230
Mom, not now. The man is practically dying.

05:12.231 --> 05:14.914
- I'm sure it can wait.
- Well, what I have to say can't.

05:19.258 --> 05:23.903
Bonnie, when those doors were
squeezing the blood out of my head,

05:24.354 --> 05:27.352
I swear my life flashed before my eyes.

05:27.685 --> 05:28.889
And in that instant

05:29.303 --> 05:31.178
all I thought about was you.

05:33.349 --> 05:34.553
Bonnie...

05:36.162 --> 05:37.421
I love you.

05:38.949 --> 05:40.655
I love you too.

05:41.578 --> 05:42.921
Yes! Whoo!

05:43.532 --> 05:45.867
Let's celebrate with some pants...

05:45.868 --> 05:49.070
'Cause I can kinda see up your gown.

05:52.616 --> 05:55.415
Okay, Emma, time to work your baby magic.

05:56.633 --> 05:58.836
Hello, baby stealer.

05:58.837 --> 06:01.280
I think you mean "bet loser."

06:01.281 --> 06:02.554
What are you guys doing here?

06:02.555 --> 06:04.793
Oh, well, we were gonna go
see that new disaster movie

06:04.794 --> 06:07.372
but why buy the ticket when
they're showing one for free here?

06:07.373 --> 06:09.910
Yeah, plus we got great seats.

06:10.359 --> 06:11.976
Don't forget to turn off your cellphone.

06:11.977 --> 06:14.609
Oh, thanks. Ooh! â™ª showtime.

06:15.066 --> 06:17.888
Heather, hi. You look lovely as always.

06:17.889 --> 06:20.541
You met me once. Can I have my earring?

06:20.851 --> 06:22.561
Not till you've met Emma.

06:23.388 --> 06:24.699
Hi, Heather.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.775
How'd you like to go
out with my daddy again?

06:26.776 --> 06:28.373
He sure does like you.

06:28.374 --> 06:29.936
Oh, sweetie, they all do.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.003
Now can I have my earring?

06:32.004 --> 06:34.098
Here here, just hold her 10 seconds

06:34.099 --> 06:35.378
and I'll give you back the earring.

06:35.832 --> 06:38.522
Come on. Come on.

06:39.704 --> 06:41.323
There you go.

06:41.783 --> 06:45.531
- Yeah.
- Aww. She is awfully cute.

06:50.771 --> 06:53.600
Here. Your baby's broken.

06:54.269 --> 06:57.967
Sorry. If you let it dry,
you can chip it off later.

06:57.968 --> 06:59.267
Earring!

07:00.862 --> 07:02.372
Gimme that.

07:03.992 --> 07:07.115
- Bravo.
- Wow. Well done.

07:07.116 --> 07:08.787
We loved every minute of that,

07:08.788 --> 07:10.790
- even though the ending was kinda predictable.
- Yeah.

07:11.685 --> 07:15.404
Hey, maybe next time you'll think
twice about baby-blocking me.

07:16.549 --> 07:18.520
Wow. I had no idea

07:18.521 --> 07:20.435
you'd be going down so quickly.

07:20.436 --> 07:22.484
I gotta start working on your punishment.

07:23.008 --> 07:25.371
Do you know where I
can find a video camera,

07:25.372 --> 07:27.711
some hair-removal cream and a tarp?

07:32.207 --> 07:35.370
This is a disaster! I
mean, what do I do now?

07:35.737 --> 07:37.566
You gotta smooth it out first.

07:39.175 --> 07:41.257
Not the dollar! Brad!

07:41.935 --> 07:43.234
Well, there's nothing to do.

07:43.235 --> 07:45.026
Now that you love him,
everything's perfect.

07:45.027 --> 07:47.553
Well, Danny... Danny, I don't love him.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.772
I just got caught up in the moment.

07:49.773 --> 07:52.519
Listen, just go down to
that fountain in the lobby

07:52.520 --> 07:54.267
and fish me out some quarters.

07:54.268 --> 07:55.523
But those are other people's wishes.

07:55.524 --> 07:57.000
Just go!

08:04.429 --> 08:05.847
You know, if you pound
it left of the spring,

08:05.848 --> 08:07.370
it'll give you what you want.

08:09.206 --> 08:11.584
Funny, I come with the same instructions.

08:12.574 --> 08:14.852
I'm not sure you should buy
anything from that machine.

08:14.853 --> 08:16.530
Some of those chips are as old as me.

08:16.531 --> 08:18.887
Well, I prefer the phrase
"aged to perfection."

08:19.902 --> 08:21.438
In that case, I'm Jim.

08:21.439 --> 08:22.778
Hi, Jim, I'm Bonnie.

08:23.197 --> 08:25.469
I hope I'm not being too
forward, but are you single?

08:26.461 --> 08:28.225
Heading in that direction.

08:29.530 --> 08:31.988
Then you'd consider having drinks with me?

08:31.989 --> 08:34.339
Well, consider it considered.

08:35.624 --> 08:37.203
- Can I get your number?
- Sure.

08:37.688 --> 08:40.900
What are the chances I'd meet
a beautiful woman in a hospital?

08:40.902 --> 08:43.972
Well, hopefully after I
walk away, slim to none.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:53.826 --> 08:55.515
What?

08:56.179 --> 08:59.034
He's the hospital snack inspector.

09:03.241 --> 09:04.333
Oh hey, dad.

09:06.711 --> 09:09.635
I can't believe it. You
just missed my girlfriend.

09:12.955 --> 09:15.314
I got less than 24 hours to
get Heather to go out with me.

09:15.315 --> 09:17.139
Do you really want to see
me humiliated in public?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.730
Hang on a sec. Yeah, I'm okay with that.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.270
Oh my God, I'm so lucky.

09:22.638 --> 09:25.203
Somebody just died in this,
so I got it for half off.

09:27.678 --> 09:29.423
What size chicken foot are you?

09:29.424 --> 09:30.786
Hey, this isn't a done deal.

09:31.545 --> 09:32.890
Nine and a half.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.559
Mom, I am not ending
things with Brad for you!

09:36.560 --> 09:39.691
Why not? I ended my prom early for you.

09:41.985 --> 09:45.484
14 lbs, Danny. You were 14 lbs.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.460
But you told Brad you love him.

09:48.461 --> 09:49.902
Well, I had to!

09:49.903 --> 09:53.096
He was just lying there all
wounded and vulnerable...

09:53.516 --> 09:55.720
In that really short gown.

09:56.689 --> 09:59.079
And then he just sucker-punched
me with an "I love you."

09:59.080 --> 10:01.217
I mean, I couldn't help but say it back.

10:01.218 --> 10:02.800
Wait, just because he said it first?

10:04.084 --> 10:06.522
I gotta try that. Where is that damn baby?

10:08.414 --> 10:11.334
I mean, that's how Jimmy Balding
got me to go out with him.

10:11.335 --> 10:12.962
You went out with Jimmy Balding too?!

10:14.661 --> 10:16.685
So, if you hear "I love you,"

10:16.686 --> 10:18.233
there's pretty much nothing you won't do?

10:19.283 --> 10:21.221
Any chance Brad's still in the hospital?

10:21.222 --> 10:23.002
I think I might wanna go pay my respects.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.876
He's not dead...

10:25.434 --> 10:27.396
Though that would make
things easier for me.

10:28.042 --> 10:29.991
- No. No.
- Mom, I seriously think

10:29.992 --> 10:31.932
you should reconsider
breaking up with Brad.

10:31.933 --> 10:34.803
I mean, he's smart, he's
funny, he's generous.

10:34.804 --> 10:37.596
Ooh, that's good. Tell him all
that stuff when you dump him.

10:40.961 --> 10:42.798
- Brad, hey.
- Hey.

10:42.799 --> 10:44.153
Great to see you up and about,

10:44.154 --> 10:45.659
looking like you're ready for anything.

10:46.603 --> 10:48.184
Absolutely anything.

10:49.032 --> 10:51.015
I'm actually really
glad that you stopped by.

10:51.016 --> 10:54.542
Hey, what do you think
about me asking your mom

10:54.543 --> 10:56.400
to move in with me?

10:56.953 --> 11:00.215
Umm, I think you should ask
me again in about two minutes.

11:01.308 --> 11:02.915
So, Brad...

11:02.916 --> 11:05.811
She just makes me feel
like no one ever has before.

11:05.812 --> 11:08.434
You know, I wanna take care
of her, I wanna make her happy.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.791
We belong together, you know?

11:10.193 --> 11:13.563
She's just... she's just perfect for me.

11:14.769 --> 11:15.982
You know what?

11:15.983 --> 11:17.638
My mom is perfect for you.

11:18.882 --> 11:20.150
That's what I've been saying!

11:20.545 --> 11:23.242
In fact, I literally just said that.

11:23.803 --> 11:25.372
You definitely shouldn't break up.

11:25.373 --> 11:28.231
- Why would we break up?
- Um, exactly!

11:28.232 --> 11:29.758
So let's go find her,

11:29.759 --> 11:31.795
and when she starts talking,
you say "I love you."

11:31.796 --> 11:34.916
Got it? Okay. But maybe we
should stop by the fountain first,

11:34.917 --> 11:36.682
so you can make a wish.

11:43.529 --> 11:44.675
Perfect.

11:54.523 --> 11:56.715
- Ben?
- Heather, is that you?

11:58.074 --> 11:59.502
What happened? I got your text.

12:00.064 --> 12:01.757
Car out of nowhere.

12:01.758 --> 12:03.305
Details are sketchy.

12:03.997 --> 12:06.275
The hospital said I should
have a lawyer come down.

12:06.276 --> 12:09.729
- Riley's a lawyer.
- They said, "good lawyer."

12:11.751 --> 12:13.901
Ben...  What's going on?

12:13.902 --> 12:16.348
And why aren't these machines working?

12:17.894 --> 12:19.934
I don't have very good insurance.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.367
Heather, look, here is the truth...

12:23.839 --> 12:25.928
- I know I don't mean anything to you...
- Yup.

12:27.382 --> 12:30.041
And that you pretty much just
used me to get back at Riley...

12:30.042 --> 12:31.297
Mm-hmm.

12:32.591 --> 12:34.695
But when I saw that bus heading for me...

12:34.696 --> 12:36.011
I thought it was a car.

12:36.012 --> 12:38.104
Large car, small bus... not important.

12:39.199 --> 12:42.462
The point is I saw my life flash before me

12:42.463 --> 12:44.153
and all I saw was you.

12:44.490 --> 12:46.437
And at first I didn't
know why or what it meant,

12:46.832 --> 12:48.015
but now I do.

12:48.745 --> 12:51.734
Heather, I love you.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.124
You know, it's a shame you don't live here.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.316
Although that's why God invented sexting.

13:03.814 --> 13:05.242
Mmm.  Well, you never know.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.536
I do have a couple of sons in town.

13:06.537 --> 13:08.740
<i>Maybe I'll find a nice
little pied-a-terre.</i>

13:08.741 --> 13:10.775
Ooh, you speak French.

13:10.776 --> 13:12.447
It's another thing we have in common.

13:13.269 --> 13:15.741
Soup du jour.

13:16.407 --> 13:17.767
It's just soup.

13:18.557 --> 13:20.184
Yeah.

13:20.185 --> 13:22.304
Oh! Time to check the meter.

13:22.305 --> 13:24.550
- Mmm.
- Please try not to get in any trouble.

13:24.551 --> 13:26.127
Well, then why am I here?

13:26.128 --> 13:27.435
Oh.

13:31.367 --> 13:33.799
Hey, is that hospital
guy? What's he doing here?

13:33.800 --> 13:35.991
If I play my cards right, hopefully me.

13:36.929 --> 13:39.169
But you can't be on a date.
Brad's gonna be here any minute.

13:39.170 --> 13:40.308
What?! No!

13:40.309 --> 13:42.557
Danny, you were supposed to handle that.

13:42.885 --> 13:46.083
Oh my God! Nothing ruins a good date faster

13:46.084 --> 13:47.903
than your boyfriend showing up!

13:48.732 --> 13:50.451
Oh my God, he's here. Get rid of him.

13:50.452 --> 13:52.347
- Go go go go go.
- Hey, Brad,

13:52.348 --> 13:54.267
a couple... two... three
changes to the plan.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.870
Mom is not coming. She might've
said something about Mexico.

13:57.733 --> 13:59.912
Hey, dad. Good, you got my message.

13:59.913 --> 14:00.882
- Mm-hmm.
- Dad?

14:01.392 --> 14:02.681
This is your dad?

14:03.499 --> 14:05.627
Yeah, he drove into town when
he heard I was in the hospital.

14:05.628 --> 14:07.021
You guys are related?!

14:08.196 --> 14:10.945
Yes, that's why I just called him "dad."

14:10.946 --> 14:13.863
- Oh yeah.
- And I may have found his next mom in the hospital.

14:13.864 --> 14:15.333
Seriously? Only you.

14:15.334 --> 14:17.776
This guy could pick up
a widow at a funeral.

14:17.777 --> 14:19.948
- Uh?
- Actually, she's right inside.

14:19.949 --> 14:21.034
Oh! Ooh.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.930
Where did she go?

14:23.931 --> 14:25.984
Well, I know where I need to go...

14:25.985 --> 14:27.905
the bathroom. Nice to meet you.

14:27.906 --> 14:30.031
Dads are great. I love dads!

14:30.032 --> 14:33.443
Where would we be without
dads? Mine's gay! Okay.

14:35.860 --> 14:38.215
Oh, dude, it worked perfectly.

14:38.216 --> 14:39.932
If I knew "I love you"
could get you a date,

14:39.933 --> 14:41.767
it would always be my opening line.

14:43.038 --> 14:45.910
I mean, if you don't mean it, who cares?

14:45.911 --> 14:48.533
I know I don't.

14:48.534 --> 14:51.396
Dude, I can't wait to try it tonight.

14:51.397 --> 14:52.552
"I love you..."

14:56.034 --> 14:58.486
I should probably find
out what her name is first.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.280
Hey, Riley, we were just talking about you.

15:02.281 --> 15:04.412
Did you come to lay down, give up, concede,

15:04.413 --> 15:06.341
slap a big "L" on your forehead?

15:06.688 --> 15:08.799
I'm a gentleman, so lady's choice.

15:10.318 --> 15:12.664
Ben, we need to talk. This bet...

15:12.665 --> 15:14.201
this whole thing is wrong.

15:14.202 --> 15:15.919
You always say that when you lose.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.312
She always says that.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.448
It's not that, okay? It's you and Heather.

15:23.370 --> 15:25.277
You and any girl, actually.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.870
Look, I know I said we should be friends

15:27.871 --> 15:30.276
and that it doesn't bother me
to think of you with other women,

15:30.277 --> 15:31.730
but it does.

15:32.482 --> 15:34.851
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that every time

15:34.852 --> 15:36.417
I think of you and Heather together,

15:36.418 --> 15:38.449
I think, "that shouldn't be her.

15:39.258 --> 15:40.606
That should be me."

15:42.887 --> 15:46.339
Ben, I'm still in love with you.

15:53.259 --> 15:55.349
Okay, well, you kids have a great night.

15:58.422 --> 16:00.941
His son?! Oh my God.

16:00.942 --> 16:03.313
I mean, I knew I had a type, but wow!

16:03.916 --> 16:06.811
- What do I do now?
- Mom, when I was a kid,

16:06.812 --> 16:09.155
what did you always tell me to
do when I was caught in a lie?

16:09.156 --> 16:13.030
- "Go get the belt."
- No, "just tell the truth and all will be forgiven."

16:13.031 --> 16:15.578
Oh, that was your dad. All
right, I'm going out the window.

16:15.579 --> 16:16.726
Assume the position.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.824
14 lbs.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.953
Go on. Get.

16:21.954 --> 16:23.591
All right, okay.

16:23.592 --> 16:24.982
All right, here we go.

16:24.983 --> 16:27.225
All right. All right,
this is gonna be perfect.

16:30.728 --> 16:33.666
Danny, I think I'm stuck.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.099
Danny, push me out!

16:40.048 --> 16:42.863
Just touch it! I'll take
you to therapy later!

16:44.170 --> 16:45.200
Come on.

16:45.975 --> 16:47.854
Ah! Come on!

16:49.154 --> 16:51.171
Bonnie?

16:52.110 --> 16:55.770
Brad! Oh, there you are.

16:56.192 --> 16:59.123
You know, I've been
looking all over for you.

16:59.858 --> 17:01.755
- What are you doing?
- Oh, you know,

17:01.756 --> 17:04.748
just hanging out. Yeah.

17:05.080 --> 17:08.356
This is one of my favorite
places in the city.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.911
It's wonderful out here.

17:11.912 --> 17:14.119
But you know what? If you
could maybe just give me a hand.

17:14.121 --> 17:16.555
Just...  Give me a hand.

17:16.556 --> 17:17.762
Yeah yeah, of course.

17:17.762 --> 17:19.742
- All right, there you go.
- Okay, one...

17:19.743 --> 17:21.034
- Two...
- Three!

17:21.035 --> 17:22.175
Pull! Pull!

17:22.175 --> 17:23.362
<i>- Pull harder.
- I can't.</i>

17:24.991 --> 17:27.666
- Harder!
- Bonnie?

17:29.464 --> 17:31.181
Hey, Jimbo.

17:31.815 --> 17:34.704
Jimbo? Wait, how do you know Bonnie?

17:35.075 --> 17:37.171
She's my date. How do you know Bonnie?

17:37.172 --> 17:38.641
She's my girlfriend.

17:41.718 --> 17:45.570
Sounds like you two
have a lot to talk about.

17:45.571 --> 17:47.790
I thought you were single.

17:47.791 --> 17:50.480
- Yeah, but...
- Single? Why would you tell him that you're single?

17:50.481 --> 17:52.229
You just told me that you loved me.

17:52.230 --> 17:54.670
Yeah, that's just something
I say to people, you know?

17:54.671 --> 17:57.608
Hey, I love you! I love you, too!

17:57.609 --> 17:59.204
Bonnie, what is going on?

17:59.205 --> 18:00.910
I thought we had something special.

18:00.911 --> 18:02.725
Yeah, Brad, we... we do.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.478
We did.

18:06.315 --> 18:07.566
Okay, here's the truth...

18:08.428 --> 18:11.271
at the end of the day, you know,

18:11.272 --> 18:13.897
you're just too immature for me.

18:15.628 --> 18:19.005
I... I need somebody more grounded.

18:20.773 --> 18:23.076
You know what? So do I.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.235
Bonnie, we're done.

18:27.444 --> 18:28.934
Dad, are you coming?

18:31.008 --> 18:32.925
- Well, if you two aren't gonna...
- Yeah.

18:35.536 --> 18:37.475
- Right behind ya, son.
- Okay.

18:37.806 --> 18:39.233
I...

18:39.234 --> 18:42.652
okay, Danny, either pull
me in or push me out, okay?

18:43.366 --> 18:45.973
Danny! Danny!

18:51.066 --> 18:52.544
You're a good son.

18:54.391 --> 18:56.019
You really think we can be together again?

18:56.020 --> 18:57.355
Are you sure you want me back?

18:57.356 --> 19:00.065
Ben, I've never been more sure of anything.

19:02.788 --> 19:04.211
Ben, are you here?

19:04.212 --> 19:05.605
Heather. Hi.

19:06.167 --> 19:07.995
What are you doing here? I thought
we were meeting at the bar...

19:08.624 --> 19:10.647
20 minutes ago. I think
I might be a little late.

19:11.730 --> 19:14.684
Oh, Riley, hi. I hope this
me-and-Ben thing isn't too weird.

19:15.111 --> 19:17.301
You-and-Ben thing?
It's just a stupid date.

19:17.302 --> 19:19.178
Oh, not to me. Ben, you were right.

19:19.179 --> 19:20.487
I don't know why I was fighting it.

19:20.488 --> 19:21.944
I don't think I actually understood

19:21.945 --> 19:24.303
how I truly felt until
you told me you loved me.

19:24.304 --> 19:25.867
Wait, he told you he loved you?

19:25.868 --> 19:27.885
- You told her you loved her?
- Sort of.

19:28.217 --> 19:30.988
Oh, there was no "sort of" about it.

19:30.989 --> 19:33.250
- So, what, you're in love with her now?
- Ben, tell her you love me.

19:33.251 --> 19:35.085
Ben, tell her you love me.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.434
Actually, Heather, the truth is

19:37.784 --> 19:40.616
I just told you I loved you to win a bet.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.792
But now that I've won this,

19:45.336 --> 19:48.116
I guess, thanks for stopping by.

19:50.618 --> 19:53.849
Oh my God, Ben. Telling
someone that you love them

19:53.850 --> 19:57.023
when you don't is just
the lowest of the low.

19:57.024 --> 19:59.379
- Even I wouldn't do that.
- And she is a horrible person.

19:59.380 --> 20:00.494
It's true.

20:06.494 --> 20:09.095
- Oh, man, you were perfect.
- No, you were perfect.

20:11.204 --> 20:12.680
W-w-wait
a second.

20:13.116 --> 20:14.758
- Did you two...
- Play you?

20:15.179 --> 20:18.379
Take you down? Slap a big
"L" across your forehead?

20:18.685 --> 20:21.040
Yes, Ben Wheeler, take note:

20:21.041 --> 20:23.432
Two girls are better than one,

20:23.433 --> 20:26.356
especially when both of
them wanna get even with you.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.710
- I think we're done here.
- Bye, Ben.

20:32.193 --> 20:34.251
Yo, for the record, I knew the whole time.

20:36.546 --> 20:38.352
Go easy on me, Riley!

20:40.953 --> 20:42.879
â™ª Everybody have a seat â™ª

20:42.880 --> 20:45.381
â™ª And watch me tap my loser feet â™ª

20:45.382 --> 20:47.224
â™ª I lost a bet, so you're in luck â™ª

20:47.225 --> 20:49.463
â™ª You get to watch me tell you I suck â™ª

20:49.464 --> 20:52.876
â™ª I took a dive, I was
slaughtered highly â™ª

20:53.801 --> 20:55.163
â™ª I wish I was as great

20:55.164 --> 20:57.344
â™ª and awesome as Riley.

20:57.345 --> 20:59.516
Yeah! Whoo!

21:00.424 --> 21:03.559
Now that is what I call "deluxe".

21:03.560 --> 21:04.753
Oh, you got off easy,

21:04.754 --> 21:07.115
I can't believe you didn't make him
do it in front of a bigger crowd.

21:07.904 --> 21:09.674
Oh I wouldn't worry about that.
