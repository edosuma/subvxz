10:03.003 --> 10:04.331
No!

And I'd go so far as to say

that it is rarely the farmer's daughter.

10:14.643 --> 10:17.444

10:23.650 --> 10:26.266

comes back from college.

their relationship.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.965
Monica does not, Jimmy gets upset.

10:34.105 --> 10:36.455
So, she ran over her
ex-lover with a tractor

10:36.495 --> 10:38.285
to avoid an awkward
conversation with her dad.

between this farmhand thing
this morning and this explosion?

11:39.239 --> 11:40.578
I feel like there might be.

11:40.811 --> 11:44.734
Here's the difference between
playing a cop and being a cop.

11:45.062 --> 11:47.382
Your feelings don't amount to squat.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.366
Just because two things
happen on the same day

11:49.391 --> 11:51.091
doesn't mean they're
connected in any way.

11:51.297 --> 11:52.327
I have a hunch.

11:52.352 --> 11:54.755
You got lucky with
the first hunch. Don't push it.

11:55.938 --> 11:56.966
You know what?

11:58.846 --> 12:00.446
Let's make this interesting.

12:00.660 --> 12:02.351
If you don't find all
of this interesting,

12:02.376 --> 12:04.086
you might want to think
about a career change.

12:04.110 --> 12:05.140
I'll make you a deal.

12:05.165 --> 12:06.502
If you're wrong,

12:06.685 --> 12:10.174
if there's no connection between
these two cases, you're gone.

12:10.551 --> 12:12.690
You tell the mayor
"Thanks, but no thanks."

12:12.815 --> 12:16.753
And if I'm right... When I'm right...

12:18.125 --> 12:19.737
I get my own desk.

12:21.846 --> 12:23.698
(SIGHING) Okay.

12:25.809 --> 12:28.610
But you go nowhere until
that paperwork's done!

12:29.606 --> 12:30.840
Roger that!

12:37.177 --> 12:38.977
Sorry, Ed, so just to be clear,

12:39.012 --> 12:41.923
there was one explosion and then,
another much bigger one?

12:41.948 --> 12:43.213
Yeah, it's not uncommon.

12:43.249 --> 12:44.806
But some of the guys
said they saw the fire

12:44.830 --> 12:46.551
burning green in spots,
which is strange.

12:46.718 --> 12:49.531
- Okay, you'll run a chem analysis?
- Yeah, it's already in the works.

12:49.556 --> 12:50.735
Any signs of break-in?

12:50.760 --> 12:52.800
Yeah, we found the lock
busted on the back entrance.

12:52.921 --> 12:54.903
Oh, well, that is a way of
making a fire look deliberate.

12:54.927 --> 12:55.950
Exactly.

12:56.149 --> 12:58.115
Now, the owner of the restaurant
landed about 10 minutes ago.

12:58.139 --> 12:59.372
His name is Colin Ray.

12:59.660 --> 13:00.893
Okay, thanks, Ed.

13:10.563 --> 13:11.658
Sure.

Sorry for your troubles, sir.
Were you the owner here long?

13:14.866 --> 13:17.280
Couple of years. It wasn't doing great,

13:17.305 --> 13:19.325
so we thought a reno
might jazz it up a bit.

13:19.350 --> 13:21.390
Oh, whole bunch of hurdles
to jump through now, huh?

13:21.470 --> 13:22.478
Yeah.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.636
You got a business partner,
or is it all on you?

13:24.775 --> 13:25.808
Just me.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.847
Okay, 'cause you said "we"?

13:28.848 --> 13:30.494
- Guess I meant the wife.
- Ah.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.013
Do you need anything else?

13:32.038 --> 13:33.849
I really got to get my daughter home.

13:34.030 --> 13:37.398
Of course. No, we have all your
details if we need anything further.

13:37.775 --> 13:38.814
Great.

13:38.968 --> 13:41.001
Sorry, uh, one more thing.

13:41.036 --> 13:43.837
Do you know if there were
any unusual chemicals inside?

13:45.214 --> 13:47.297
You know, can't say I do.

13:48.015 --> 13:49.359
I mean, it's a reno.

13:49.645 --> 13:53.231
Contractors could have brought
in paint thinner, Varathane,

13:53.256 --> 13:55.107
- who knows?
- Of course.

13:55.984 --> 13:58.951
Well, thanks again and we'll
call if we need anything else.

13:59.302 --> 14:00.606
- Sure.
- All right.

sit in some dark movie theatre.

So, how exactly does this new gig work?

Are there rules to being

14:38.458 --> 14:41.869
actually, no, check that,
knowing you and knowing Sam,

14:41.894 --> 14:43.594

14:43.988 --> 14:47.297
Sam and I are in an open

14:47.332 --> 14:48.339
Mm-hmm.

14:49.057 --> 14:51.113
Why is it always the guy
that suggests that?

14:51.466 --> 14:53.466
We're exploring our boundaries.

14:54.472 --> 14:56.339

you're doing, does she?

14:56.375 --> 14:57.907
Yeah, that's great.

14:58.394 --> 15:00.610
If we help her out, she'll be happy.

But you know, when it comes to
the whole asking permission

15:03.481 --> 15:05.648
versus begging for forgiveness thing...

15:05.683 --> 15:07.483
Then, you're just gonna
bat your eyes and say,

15:07.518 --> 15:08.850
"Sorry, I didn't know."

15:09.254 --> 15:12.421
Not having written-down
rules comes in handy.

15:12.456 --> 15:15.093
You know what? For most
of us, rules have teeth

15:15.118 --> 15:16.372
and when you break 'em, they bite.

15:16.396 --> 15:18.900
I have never once been bitten by a rule.

15:18.989 --> 15:20.906

15:55.306 --> 15:56.826

15:56.997 --> 15:58.476
I'm gonna tell anyone who will listen

15:58.500 --> 16:01.107
that you swore you were
a cop who had a warrant.

16:01.295 --> 16:03.199
It's 100% believable.

Ugh, locked.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.425
Doesn't anyone trust anyone anymore?

Yeah, you got to do the breaking

to leave the club

21:05.283 --> 21:08.955
One of the chemicals found at
the scene was anhydrous ammonia,

21:08.980 --> 21:10.362
which is used in meth labs...

21:10.398 --> 21:14.199
- Yes, I get the meth lab, Sam!
- But also used on farms.

How about you make a night of it, huh?

32:33.621 --> 32:34.640
Go see a movie.

32:35.725 --> 32:36.797
What's going on?

32:37.165 --> 32:38.233
Nothing.

32:38.826 --> 32:39.883
Have fun.

32:42.497 --> 32:43.555
Go.

32:50.292 --> 32:51.865
What is it? Is everything okay?

32:52.421 --> 32:53.773
I think he's in trouble.

33:04.161 --> 33:05.278
He isn't answering.

33:08.305 --> 33:09.497
Your dad's gonna be fine.

33:09.532 --> 33:11.344
We have officers on the way.

33:11.399 --> 33:13.239
No matter what happens,
this is gonna kill him.

33:14.141 --> 33:16.941
All he wanted was for me to get the
degree that he never finished.

33:17.738 --> 33:18.910
You mean chemistry?

33:19.909 --> 33:21.740
Your father studied
chemistry, didn't he?

33:22.185 --> 33:23.216
Yeah.

33:23.345 --> 33:24.435
Why do you ask?

33:26.991 --> 33:29.015
Because he's the one that
blew up the biker lab.

33:30.840 --> 33:31.840
What?

33:35.809 --> 33:37.668
You shouldn't have
messed with my daughter.

33:38.186 --> 33:39.198
Argh!

33:39.974 --> 33:41.626
BIKER: Put down the bat, old man.

33:41.950 --> 33:43.028
Ugh!

33:43.278 --> 33:44.298
Ahh!

33:46.233 --> 33:47.892
Everybody freeze!

33:48.767 --> 33:50.267
Drop the bat, Bill.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.672
Do it, now!

33:54.013 --> 33:55.340
I'm not going to jail.

33:55.547 --> 33:56.816
I didn't do anything!

33:57.144 --> 33:58.761
Is that the bat you used on Jimmy?

33:59.112 --> 34:00.378
(BIKER GROANING)

Jimmy!

34:03.683 --> 34:05.817
(TRACTOR STOPPING)

34:06.056 --> 34:08.579
You discovered that your
ammonia had been siphoned,

34:08.603 --> 34:09.893
and you blamed Jimmy.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.356
And that he hooked your
daughter up with the bikers.

34:12.534 --> 34:14.123
What do you got her involved in, hmm?

34:14.149 --> 34:15.415
What are you...

34:15.531 --> 34:17.781
Okay, yes, I set her up with them,

34:18.712 --> 34:20.043
but she stole the chemicals.

34:20.069 --> 34:21.594
She was just trying to protect you

34:21.697 --> 34:23.610
and protect the farm.

34:25.532 --> 34:26.572
Ugh!

34:28.438 --> 34:30.005
(JIMMY SCREAMING)

34:30.030 --> 34:32.803
You thought that he ruined her life,
so you killed him.

34:32.858 --> 34:35.558
- No!
- Ahhh! I'm sorry, please!

34:35.583 --> 34:36.612
And what do you do?

34:36.647 --> 34:38.838
You blow up a restaurant.

34:39.558 --> 34:41.330
But I didn't kill the boy.

34:41.355 --> 34:43.261
He was alive when I left.

34:43.853 --> 34:45.522
Stay away from my daughter.

34:47.217 --> 34:48.255
(JIMMY GROANING)

Oh, for... Drop it!

35:05.926 --> 35:07.274
Now you're pissing me off.

35:07.803 --> 35:09.051
You're not gonna shoot me.

35:09.211 --> 35:12.779
You're gonna let me and my
friend Bill walk out of here.

(GUNSHOT)

35:14.183 --> 35:16.983

I did not kill Jimmy!

I think I'm having one of your hunches.

Hey, what's going on?

36:18.541 --> 36:19.566
Why weren't you surprised

36:19.591 --> 36:21.491
when the cops showed up at Emmory Farms?

36:21.777 --> 36:22.792
What?

36:23.089 --> 36:24.176
You said you weren't surprised

36:24.200 --> 36:25.982
when the cops showed up at Emmory Farms.

36:26.401 --> 36:28.428
Well, I just... I just
meant, you know...

36:28.453 --> 36:29.492
You weren't surprised

36:29.517 --> 36:31.237
because you watched the
whole thing go down.

36:33.566 --> 36:37.601
(JIMMY SCREAMING)

36:47.604 --> 36:48.977
You knew Karen was having an affair

36:49.001 --> 36:51.687
because you found their
love nest in the attic.

36:54.682 --> 36:55.909
So, you killed the kid

36:55.945 --> 36:57.955
that you thought was
sleeping with your wife.

37:06.167 --> 37:08.982
Please, call an ambulance.

You get revenge on Jimmy,

37:12.310 --> 37:13.752
pin the whole thing on Bill.

37:26.206 --> 37:27.784
Every time Bill Emmory
would head into town,

37:27.808 --> 37:30.042
you'd make excuses to
go across the road.

37:30.996 --> 37:32.411
That's why you couldn't believe it

37:32.446 --> 37:35.291
when you saw some punk
sneaking out of your house,

37:35.316 --> 37:37.476
because you thought you
already took care of that punk.

37:37.764 --> 37:40.311
I didn't plan it. It just happened.

37:41.053 --> 37:42.720

someone's capable of.

Right, Nico?

You idiot.

37:49.253 --> 37:51.019
I fell in love with Monica.

makes people the craziest.

- Really?
- Yeah,

better than a desk.
