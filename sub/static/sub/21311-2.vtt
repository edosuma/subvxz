00:01.569 --> 00:04.205
- Previously on "Shooter"...
- If you ask any Marine,

00:04.772 --> 00:05.506
the reason we fought

00:06.374 --> 00:07.641
was to make sure
we all got to come home.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.111
[people screaming]

00:10.144 --> 00:11.345
They're all wired!

Kevin!
[gunshot]

00:13.381 --> 00:14.382
- [screams]

00:14.415 --> 00:16.184
- Colin, I saw a shooter.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.451
- Brother, I want payback
just as much as you do,

00:17.485 --> 00:19.120
but even if there
was a shooter,

00:19.153 --> 00:21.389
how are we gonna find him?

00:21.422 --> 00:23.424
- Yeah, he was here.
He hung a screen.

00:23.457 --> 00:27.128
- Ah, God damn it.
- She must've surprised him.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.063
- What the hell
are you doing, anyway?

00:29.097 --> 00:30.331
You have any idea how deep
this shit would be

00:30.364 --> 00:32.200
if they caught you there?

00:32.233 --> 00:33.634
- I have a job for you.
- And I've told you no.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.269
- You didn't even ask
what it is.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.238
- I'm happy at the FBI.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.840
- How are you?
- This isn't normal for me.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.275
- Sweetheart,
this isn't normal for anyone.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.543
- I can have Julie Swagger

00:42.576 --> 00:44.378
in the air in 90 minutes.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.180
- You're doing this out
of the kindness of your heart,

00:46.214 --> 00:47.515
or is this you trying
to get me to work for you?

00:49.250 --> 00:51.085
- [speaking Mandarin]

00:51.119 --> 00:52.153
- What are you talking about?

00:52.186 --> 00:53.254

00:53.287 --> 00:56.324
[gunfire]

00:57.891 --> 01:00.261
- [grunts]
- Ah!

01:00.294 --> 01:01.695
- I'm hit.
I can't feel it.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.297
- That's the shock.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.666
- I'll survive this.
I promise.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.869
- Whoever this is,
he's good.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.706
[dramatic music]

01:12.740 --> 01:15.243
[gunshot]
- This wasn't terrorism.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.146
It was murder.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.648
And we're being hunted.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.651
[tense music]

I got eyes on Abu Waheed.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.461
- 3 Actual,
you have the green light.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.297
- Send in the bad news.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.632
[gunshot]

01:38.666 --> 01:40.534
- Where'd he go?
- Oh, shit.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.336
So much for Mr. I Never Miss.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.538
- 3-1, can you confirm the kill?

01:44.572 --> 01:46.207
- Negative.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.641
- Roger.
Maintain overwatch.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.143
We're moving in for a look.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.447
all: Good.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.615
- 3-4, troop is in contact.
We got...

03:01.649 --> 03:04.318
four down.
- All right, this is 3-2.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.487
I advise you check out
that two-story building,

03:06.520 --> 03:08.289
northwest corner of town.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.291

What do you see, 3-2?

03:10.324 --> 03:12.326
- I got visuals
on satellite dishes.

called for dead guys.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.747
- No more threats
at this time, over.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.584
- All right, now move
to our position.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.752

05:08.609 --> 05:11.679
- We found blood,
but no body.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.748

You gotta see this.

- Jesus, Tio,
doesn't the Embassy have

06:01.829 --> 06:04.432
any cars with better seats?
- You do realize

06:04.465 --> 06:05.866
the city is still
basically on lockdown?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.735
- That's why we called you.
- Dobbs,

06:07.768 --> 06:10.103
let me tell you something.
I'm not an Uber, okay?

06:10.137 --> 06:12.172
And I don't know why
you guys want to go

06:12.205 --> 06:14.542
to the airport anyway.
It's still a shit show there.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.611
[siren wailing]

06:18.712 --> 06:19.813
- These guys are Turkish, right?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.582
- According to what I heard.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.617
They rolled in
on Maltese passports.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.553
- Suicide bombers from Malta.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.955
Yeah, I'm waving
the bullshit flag on that one.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.491
- Malta sells
economic citizenship.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.892
They bought their passports.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.961
- Yeah, 100,000 Euros, at least.
- [whistles]

06:33.994 --> 06:36.430
- So, you're sure
the consul won't talk?

06:36.464 --> 06:38.832
- German intelligence says
he yelled diplo-immunity.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.568
He's gonna be expelled ASAP.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.738
Is that why we're going
to the airport?

06:44.772 --> 06:47.140
Are you hoping to intercept him?
- It was.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.178
I got a better idea.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.486
- Morning.
- Oh!

07:32.520 --> 07:34.922
I am so glad you're home safe.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.224

07:37.257 --> 07:38.726
over the moon.
- Mm-hmm.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.928
- Did she wake up
when you went in?

07:40.961 --> 07:44.665
- No, she slept like a rock.
I'm glad.

07:44.698 --> 07:48.235
Thanks.
- Are you okay?

07:48.268 --> 07:51.038
- I'm fine.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.007
Thanks.
- Any word from Bob Lee?

07:56.544 --> 07:59.847

when he can bring Kevin.

08:37.718 --> 08:41.822
Hi!
Oh, my gosh, Mousey!

08:41.855 --> 08:44.692
- Estella said you guys
were both coming home.

08:44.725 --> 08:45.893
- I know.
Daddy will be home

08:45.926 --> 08:47.327
tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.697
- Mmm.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.832
[chuckles]

08:51.865 --> 08:53.967

when you leave.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.570
- Me either.
I miss you too much.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.839
[laughs]
And you grow, like,

08:58.872 --> 09:00.340
five inches every time
I leave.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.976
[laughs]
- Did Dad get me any coins?

09:03.010 --> 09:04.978
- I don't know.
We should ask him, huh?

09:05.012 --> 09:06.947
- Yeah.
- I'm sure he will.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.017
[horns honking
and indistinct chatter]

09:12.385 --> 09:15.856

- This'll pinch.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.891
Antibiotics until we get
to Beirut.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.728
They have one of the best
hospitals in the world.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.996
- Won't they be expecting us
at the airport?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.732
- We'll travel overground
to Laos,

09:24.765 --> 09:26.734
charter a flight from there.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.603
- But what about the money
and passports?

09:29.637 --> 09:32.940
- I have a go-bag at the gym.
We'll switch cars after.

09:32.973 --> 09:36.877
Once we're clear, we'll figure
out what to do from there.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.047
- You said it would
never be boring.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.716
- I figured we'd
travel the world as tourists.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.655

- Who are you, huh?

11:24.051 --> 11:26.186
What do you want?
- You sold passports

11:26.219 --> 11:28.055
to terrorists who killed
American Marines.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

Huh?

11:51.845 --> 11:54.748
- You see that?
You're next!

11:54.782 --> 11:56.884
You died the minute
you sold those passports.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.118
I alone can bring you back,

11:58.151 --> 11:59.953
but you tell me
who the buyer was!

11:59.987 --> 12:01.488

all of you.

are investigating.

a random terror attack.

It wasn't.

Now, you know I'm right,

Just give us some time

13:01.849 --> 13:03.851

We have a lead on a location.

at the Embassy,

13:05.252 --> 13:06.987
and then I'm wheels up
at midnight.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.355
You're either on the plane,
or you're on your own.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.958
I'll clean this up.
You have your passports?

13:10.991 --> 13:12.325
- Yeah, at the hotel.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.194
- I'll get 'em.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.164
- I'm in--at the Brandt, room...

13:17.197 --> 13:19.566
- 512.
I know.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.934
- 514.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.906
[door clatters]

13:28.308 --> 13:30.077
- Clear!

13:32.913 --> 13:36.083
- [woman sobbing]
- Clear!

13:36.116 --> 13:38.085
- [sobbing]
- Clear!

13:38.118 --> 13:40.820
- This is 3-2.
Jackpot.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.100
- He's dead.
- All right, guys,

13:53.133 --> 13:54.301
let's bag him
and get him out of here.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.171
- [woman sobbing loudly]

13:58.205 --> 14:00.407
- Jesus Christ, really?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.943
Her husband was a drug dealer,
not Saint Teresa.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.311
- You know, that is, like,
nine kinds of disrespectful.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.213
- We need to get
that Engagement Team in here.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.181
- All right, they're just
on the outside of town,

14:08.215 --> 14:10.050
waiting for the all clear.
Let me see if I can raise 'em.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.318
- Hey, hey, make sure
they send the cute one.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.986
What's her name?
- What do you mean,

14:13.020 --> 14:14.354
"What's her name?"
You're the one

14:14.387 --> 14:16.089
always talking to her.
- Yeah, yeah,

14:16.123 --> 14:17.390
but that doesn't mean
I'm listening.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.326
Know what I'm saying?
- [scoffs]

14:19.359 --> 14:20.460
You're just a big, dumb animal,
aren't you, Rodriguez?

14:20.493 --> 14:22.062
- Don't hate the player.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.431
Hate the game, hombre.
- Game?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.333
You got no game, man.
- What?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.969
- Zero game.
And her name is Tio, by the way.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.271
Sergeant Tio.
- "Tio," thanks.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.940
- Tio, this is 3-4.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.908
Are you on the net?
- Go for Tio.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.109
- We're gonna need you
down here.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.677
The mullah's wife
is freaking out.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.046
- Sounded like you guys
had contact.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.380
- No, no, we're all good here.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.382
We got Nailer on overwatch.
Don't sweat it.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.117
Why don't you roll in through
the south side of town,

14:44.151 --> 14:45.953
and I'll flag you down?
- Roger that.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.154
I'm Oscar Mike.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.021
[pounds on vehicle hood]

15:00.367 --> 15:07.407
*

15:08.375 --> 15:10.177
- Where do you need me?
- On a beach

15:10.210 --> 15:12.045
in a bikini, mamacita.
- Really?

15:12.079 --> 15:13.413
Who else is gonna be there?

15:13.446 --> 15:15.315
Put him on a leash already,
would you?

15:15.348 --> 15:16.984
- Hey, baby,
ain't no leash strong enough

15:17.017 --> 15:18.285
to hold back my love.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.253
- [chuckles]
God, man.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.122
- All right, enough bullshit.
They're bagging up

15:22.155 --> 15:24.124
the mullah's body right now.
We found a shit-ton of H.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.193
- Ooh, I can't imagine
that's going over well.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.961
- Just another day in paradise.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.229
- Let's go see what she knows.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.397
both: Let's go.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.234
*

15:34.267 --> 15:37.237

[sobbing]

15:46.413 --> 15:51.351
*

15:51.384 --> 15:53.186
- All right,
so what's the plan?

15:53.220 --> 15:54.988
- Waiting on orders.
- So the neighbor clan

15:55.022 --> 15:56.256
can come down here
with their pickups

15:56.289 --> 15:58.025
and just load up
like it's Christmas?

15:58.058 --> 15:59.559
- There's $100 million worth
of heroin

15:59.592 --> 16:01.228
in that safe house.
You honestly think

16:01.261 --> 16:03.063
that someone
ain't coming for that?

16:03.096 --> 16:04.497
- I say we bug out
before this goes sideways.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.299
I'm not defending
Pablo Escobar's summer home.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.101
- You'll defend what
I tell you to defend.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.170
Is that clear?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.408
- [woman sobbing]
- Burn it.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.210
Torch the building, too.

16:17.244 --> 16:20.280
- We're not the DEA.
These people are farmers.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.083
We destroy their livelihood,
we radicalize the whole village.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.584
- If we leave this behind,
it's like leaving a blank check

16:24.617 --> 16:26.786
to buy weapons.
- Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt,

16:26.819 --> 16:28.355
but base is saying we got
a shit-ton of bad guys

16:28.388 --> 16:30.123
headed our way.
- Yo, you want me to call

16:30.157 --> 16:32.159
for an exfil?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.326
- How far away are the hostiles?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.195
- About a click.

16:35.228 --> 16:38.365
- That's, like, ten minutes
on foot in this terrain.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.333
We can dig in,
buy you some time.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.169
They want a gunfight,
we'll give it to 'em.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.570
- How much spare diesel
do we have?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.605
- Oh, we got enough.
- All right, Dobbs.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.407
Grab some guys,
go pack up those drugs

16:47.440 --> 16:49.209
to be destroyed.
- Roger that.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.078
- Bob Lee, overwatch.
- I'll set up on top

16:51.111 --> 16:53.113
of the drug stash.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.815
It's the safest building here.
They're not gonna send an RPG.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.317
- Buy us as much time
as you can.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.351
- Copy.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.487
Let's go, Pork.

17:00.520 --> 17:07.560

17:19.372 --> 17:21.341

Here we go again.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.642
- [chuckles]
Come on, Pork.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.511
We're gonna do
some good hunting.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.414
Just like the Alamo.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.350
- You realize how
the Alamo went down, right?

17:30.383 --> 17:33.853

17:42.395 --> 17:44.831
- Help you?

17:44.864 --> 17:47.200
- Heinrichs, Federal Police.
And you?

17:47.234 --> 17:50.670
- Nadine Memphis, FBI.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.405
I didn't realize
the Federal Police

17:52.439 --> 17:55.142
could perform searches
without a warrant.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.876
- And I didn't realize
we had extended

17:56.909 --> 17:59.579
jurisdictional courtesies
to the FBI.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.648
This hotel is a crime scene.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.416
Swagger and his friends
have gone missing.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.152
Have you been
in contact with them?

18:05.185 --> 18:08.521
- Well, are they under arrest?
- No.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.158
- He's leaving at midnight.
I'm here to collect his things.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.160
- Ah.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.861
Very well.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.497
*

18:17.530 --> 18:20.333
- What district were you from?

18:20.367 --> 18:23.170
- Giessen.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.139
- You got here fast.
- I was in the area.

18:26.173 --> 18:30.210
*

18:30.243 --> 18:33.180
- Does the name Golden Crescent
mean anything to you?

18:33.213 --> 18:35.348
[ominous musical sting]

18:35.382 --> 18:38.451
- Hmm.
Why--why do you ask?

18:38.485 --> 18:40.153
- Just checking a lead.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.921
*

18:41.954 --> 18:43.923
- Golden Crescent.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.227
An Arab crime syndicate.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.162
Besides drugs and prostitution,

18:49.196 --> 18:52.732
they also lend money to refugees
for exorbitant rates.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.901
They're pieces of shit
who prey on their own people,

18:54.934 --> 18:57.704
but there's nothing we can do.
- Why's that?

18:57.737 --> 19:00.507
- Well, we can't prove
who runs it.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.478
I have a cell number,
but I'm afraid

19:05.512 --> 19:08.248
we do not have the same
cell phone tracking capabilities

19:08.281 --> 19:11.418
as Uncle Sam.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.620
- Perhaps Uncle Sam can help.

19:13.653 --> 19:20.660
*

19:29.669 --> 19:32.572
- If you get anywhere,
I'd appreciate a call.

19:32.605 --> 19:36.243
- Thanks, Officer...
- Heinrichs.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.345

19:47.487 --> 19:50.189

the warehouse immediately.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.601
- All right,
do a counter-surveillance route

20:01.634 --> 20:03.670
and circle back in two minutes.
- All right.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.706
Hey, be careful.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.676
- Keep the engine running.

the right place?

to find out.

- Roger that.
- No, you gotta stay

23:06.986 --> 23:08.788
in the van.
You're active duty.

If this thing
turns into a goat screw,

23:10.523 --> 23:11.658
I don't want you
going to Leavenworth.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.661
I'm letting you go
in there without me?

23:14.694 --> 23:16.028
They killed our friends.

when you could have a...bat?

your pistol for a pry bar?

We gotta expect that

23:30.677 --> 23:32.745
they're armed with more
than just sporting goods, okay?

23:32.779 --> 23:34.814
Speed's our only security.
We hit it hard and fast.

they made the vests.

- "Black Wolf Bar,
Austin, Texas."

I got it at 7-6-2 meters.

7 1/2--low on his belt.

Aw, no smoke for you.
You're a bad boy.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.007
- I'm not worried
about our boys, Gunny.

38:29.040 --> 38:33.845
We burned $100 million worth
of CIA dope.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.548
You don't think there's
gonna be some blowback?

38:39.418 --> 38:40.919
- Mr. Johnson,

38:40.952 --> 38:43.489
nine months ago,
you crossed into Canada

38:43.522 --> 38:45.424
on foot at Niagara Falls.

38:45.457 --> 38:49.094
Then today, you return
on a one-way ticket from Tokyo.

38:49.127 --> 38:54.533
During that time, Rasheed Newson
visited Cape Town,

38:54.566 --> 38:57.002
Algiers, and Athens...

38:57.035 --> 38:59.505
while Thomas James Brady
went to Istanbul,

38:59.538 --> 39:02.941
New Dehli, and Bangkok.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.644
- I came here
on a valid passport.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.613
You had no right to stop me.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.415
- If you didn't do
anything wrong,

39:09.448 --> 39:11.116
then why is there
an Interpol orange notice

39:11.149 --> 39:13.985
indicating you are a threat
to national security?

39:15.554 --> 39:17.623
- Patricia Gregson.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.391
- Who's that?
Your lawyer?

39:19.425 --> 39:21.927
- Patricia. Gregson.

39:24.129 --> 39:27.165
[engines whirring]

39:27.198 --> 39:30.101
- Ten minutes.
- Any issue with the police?

39:30.135 --> 39:31.570
- It's like you
were never there--

39:31.603 --> 39:33.605
'cause you weren't.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.140
Tio will do her part?

39:35.173 --> 39:37.543
- She's solid.
She won't say a word.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.177
- I still think
she should've come with us.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.613
- She's a Marine.

39:41.647 --> 39:44.683
[carts rattling]

39:48.153 --> 39:51.156
- Whoever did this
is gonna get put down.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.659
- Copy that.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.127
First, we need
to get our boys home.

40:35.701 --> 40:37.736
- [speaking Spanish]

40:47.078 --> 40:49.581
[gunshots]
- [grunting]

40:52.050 --> 40:55.521
- [grunting]

40:55.554 --> 40:57.723
[panting]

40:57.756 --> 41:00.191
[gunshot]
- Ah!

41:00.225 --> 41:03.128
[eerie music]

41:03.161 --> 41:10.201
*

41:16.074 --> 41:17.108
[gunshot]

41:21.580 --> 41:28.654
*
