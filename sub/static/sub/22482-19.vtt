Nope.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.625
What about work?

00:16.668 --> 00:18.975

to chase you out.

Oh, no, it's not about you,
Christy. Call me if she leaves.

This day is a disaster.

01:10.809 --> 01:13.899
Yeah?I'm sorry to bother you.
Are you the building manager?

Well, actually, I saw
the vacancy sign out front,

in the apartment.

building amenities?

01:28.479 --> 01:30.612
Square footage,
I would say medium.

01:30.655 --> 01:31.874
And, uh,
as for amenities,

01:31.917 --> 01:34.137
there's a weird guy
on the third floor

who'll rub your feet
if you let him.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.228
I have a dog.
Is that okay?

01:38.272 --> 01:39.969
The building owner
doesn't allow pets,

01:40.012 --> 01:43.059
but if you slip me 50 bucks,
we never had this conversation.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.756
So it'll be our little secret?

So, how'd you end up
owning the building?

What happened to Tony,
who I never saw

02:38.854 --> 02:41.073

Nope. No, you don't,

02:57.655 --> 03:01.181
So, what went down with Tony,
whose toupee is no secret?

03:07.709 --> 03:09.667
He woke up one day and told me,

03:09.711 --> 03:11.669
"I'm leaving you
for the dry cleaner."

03:11.713 --> 03:13.454

was announcing his errands

Your dry cleaner

You just don't see it

I want this building

I can raise the rent.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.234
Because I hate it!

09:43.278 --> 09:44.540
It's humiliating!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.586
I'm in my 50s,
and I'm plunging toilets.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.458
This was not the dream, Marge.Okay, what is the dream?

09:49.501 --> 09:51.025
Well, I don't know,
but it doesn't involve

09:51.068 --> 09:53.244
chasing raccoons
out of a garbage closet.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.637
But that is the job.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.247
Right. And if I do it well,

09:56.291 --> 09:57.771
then I'll be doing it
for the rest of my life,

09:57.814 --> 09:59.816
and then that's just who I am.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.644
[exhales] Damn it,

10:01.688 --> 10:05.387
we just found the underlying
blah, blah, blah.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.694
Look, you might not be doing
what you want to

10:07.737 --> 10:09.609
with your life,
but that's not Rita's fault.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.436
[scoffs] Shut up.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.439
Bonnie, the job
isn't who you are.

10:14.483 --> 10:15.527
It's just what you're doing

10:15.571 --> 10:17.268
on the road to what
you're gonna be.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.314
[sighs] I said shut up.

10:21.316 --> 10:24.449
Did you actually
want this in here?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.496
No fork?
What am I, an animal?

10:35.069 --> 10:36.418
Got to say, these things
are a lot easier

10:36.461 --> 10:37.767
to drag without a body inside.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.425
Adam, what the hell
are you doing?

10:43.468 --> 10:45.296
Fixing the fountain.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.647
All I said was
clean out the leaves.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.214
I told you above and beyond
makes her mad.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.564
I just think
if this was level

10:52.608 --> 10:53.783
and the tubing was replaced,

10:53.827 --> 10:55.132
that I could
get it working again.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.481
You could even
have fish in here.

10:56.525 --> 10:59.049
Fish? She barely kept me alive.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.356
What will you talk about

11:01.399 --> 11:03.401
when you finally forgive me
for the past?

11:03.445 --> 11:05.490
I'm not overly concerned.

11:05.534 --> 11:08.232
Just shove that thing
back on the wall.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.669
Hey, you know,
don't ask for my help

11:09.712 --> 11:11.235
if you don't want
the job done right.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.498
Oh, God,
Rita's coming.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.761
How do you know?

11:14.804 --> 11:16.937
All the birds just
flew out of that tree.

11:19.026 --> 11:23.247
Rita, hi. What a lovely
giant flower sweater.

11:27.034 --> 11:30.341
I thought I made it clear
I'm not paying for extra help.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.517
Oh, don't worry, I pay him
in sex and her in Doritos.

11:33.736 --> 11:36.434
Cool Ranch, family size.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.437
So you two
are together?

11:39.481 --> 11:40.830
Yes, this is Adam,
my fiancé.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.876
Hi, good to meet you...Let me see the ring.

11:42.919 --> 11:47.445
Nice. Just be careful
where you send his shirts.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.492
Rita, I want
to apologize

11:50.535 --> 11:52.233
if I seemed
a little resistant

11:52.276 --> 11:56.454
to what are obviously necessary
upgrades to our lovely building.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.935
You are the boss,
so what you say goes.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.763
Thank you for understanding

12:00.807 --> 12:03.592
what everyone else who has a job
already understands.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.463
[phone chimes]

12:05.507 --> 12:09.598
Oh, my God, I got a match
on Match. I matched.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.339
Is it desperate
if I call him right now?

12:11.382 --> 12:13.167
I don't, I don't care.

12:13.210 --> 12:16.344
You've done such
a wonderful job with her.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.346
Now, I've been looking over
the rent receipts

12:18.389 --> 12:21.349
and we have a few tenants
that are behind.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.655
Anyone who owes
more than two months,

12:23.699 --> 12:25.092
get the money or evict them.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.571
Not a problem.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.443
I have some experience
shaking down people for money.

12:29.357 --> 12:32.708
As part of my extensive...
charity work.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.667
Yes, that fits perfectly with
everything I know about you.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.975
[chuckles]
Funny one, boss.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.586
I'll find out
whose bike that is.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.592
Wow, Bonnie,
you handled that great.

12:47.636 --> 12:50.204
Oh, good, you're impressed.
What the hell do I care?

12:50.247 --> 12:51.553
Why are you snapping at me?

12:51.596 --> 12:53.294
Because I can't snap at her.

12:53.337 --> 12:56.079
I love you, you're sweet.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.428
CHRISTY:
Hey.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.387
Quick question,
am I desperate enough

12:59.430 --> 13:01.171
to have frozen yogurt
with a magician?

13:02.303 --> 13:03.826
I don't care.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.568
Hi, Mr. Mysterio, it's a go.

13:10.659 --> 13:14.228
Three months? I thought I was
only two months behind.

13:14.271 --> 13:15.795
Sorry to bring it up,

13:15.838 --> 13:19.581
it's just the new owner
is kind of cracking down.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.976
So... where do you
hide the cash?

13:23.019 --> 13:25.935
Cereal box?
Cookie jar?

13:25.979 --> 13:28.198
Stuffed inside
a frozen chicken?

13:28.242 --> 13:31.680
Thieves never look
inside a chicken.

13:31.723 --> 13:32.986
You know what,
I'm out of checks.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.596
How 'bout I get it to you
later this week?

13:34.639 --> 13:36.380
I kind of need it now.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.773
I could drive you
to the bank.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.254
I don't have it, Bonnie.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.430
You mean like on the level
you don't have it?

13:42.473 --> 13:45.781
I don't know if you're looking
at me, but I'm shaking my head.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.261
You've lived here
for a hundred years,

13:47.304 --> 13:48.523
you're never late with the rent.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.047
Hang on, you just put
two of the big ones

13:51.091 --> 13:52.875
in the Thursday slot.
Is that right?

13:52.919 --> 13:55.443
It is if I want to
sleep till Sunday.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.620
Let me do this.
Yeah.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.318
One in each?Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, thanks.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.452
I'm not, uh, concentrating
too good right now.

14:04.495 --> 14:05.888
So what's going on?

14:05.932 --> 14:08.543
Well, a couple of months ago,
I got diagnosed with, uh,

14:08.586 --> 14:10.545
prostate cancer.

14:10.588 --> 14:11.851
They found it early,

14:11.894 --> 14:13.722
but they put me on
a couple of medications

14:13.765 --> 14:15.376
the VA doesn't cover, so...

14:15.419 --> 14:16.986
You can't pay your rent.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.597
Oh, I could pay it, but then
I'd have a whole lot of cancer.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.297
Sorry.

14:23.340 --> 14:28.215
These ones are... Monday,
Wednesday, and-and Friday.

14:28.258 --> 14:31.000
There's got to be something
you can do.

14:31.044 --> 14:35.135
Well, I've been trying
to avoid the building manager,

14:35.178 --> 14:37.659
but here you are.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.013
Son of a bitch.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.449
We just took a break.It's been two minutes.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.322
Not you. Munson.Who's Munson?

14:48.365 --> 14:50.237
Blind guy who lives upstairs.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.760
Oh, I like him.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.936
One day we were hanging out
in front of the building,

14:53.980 --> 14:56.721
we made five bucks
for doing nothing.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.291
You guys should go out there
till he makes his rent

15:01.335 --> 15:02.945
'cause he's three months behind.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.512
And he won't pay?

15:04.555 --> 15:06.601
He can't. I'm not evicting
a blind veteran who has cancer.

15:06.644 --> 15:07.950
I'm not doing it.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.386
He's got cancer?

15:09.430 --> 15:11.345
Prostate. And you're getting
a full physical, mister,

15:11.388 --> 15:12.389
including the finger thing.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.306
And don't pinch up,
they got to really look around.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.966
Anyway, Munson can't afford
his meds and rent.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.968
He's got no family,
no support system.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.317
What are you gonna do?

15:27.361 --> 15:29.406
I'm gonna try to talk
some sense into Rita.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.322
Calmly and rationally? Please?

15:32.366 --> 15:34.324
Look, I made peace
with the fact that eating crap

15:34.368 --> 15:36.848
is part of my job, but this
is where I draw the line.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.416
Yeah, that's right,
I draw a line sometimes.

15:43.203 --> 15:46.771
See, now, that didn't sound
calm and rational.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.383
That sounded hot
and "we get kicked out-y."

15:49.426 --> 15:51.994
You're right, you're right.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.605
It just burns me up that-that
rich people like Rita

15:54.649 --> 15:57.130
run everything and people
like us and Munson get screwed.

15:58.435 --> 16:01.438
I did stunts on a movie
like this one time.

16:02.265 --> 16:06.008
It was called Ski Academy.

16:06.052 --> 16:10.099
The rich kids wouldn't let the
poor kids be on the ski patrol.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.449
The poor kids turned off
the power to the lift,

16:12.493 --> 16:14.886
so the rich kids got stuck.

16:22.285 --> 16:26.420
Anyway, I got it on VHS
if anybody wants to see it.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.990
Here we are.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.861
I've got two kinds
of cookies, some cheese,

16:32.904 --> 16:34.428
and a rogue chicken nugget.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.257
Can I get you anything else
or are you good?

16:37.300 --> 16:39.389
I'm swaddled in luxury.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.044
Now why am I here?

16:42.088 --> 16:43.698
Here's the thing.
[clears throat]

16:43.741 --> 16:47.006
One of the tenants you asked me
to evict is Mr. Munson in 2G.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.878
He's a blind Vietnam vet who's
now facing a health crisis.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.358
And while you're
the boss,

16:51.401 --> 16:52.968
and I'm on board
with that,

16:53.012 --> 16:56.885
I got to respectfully say...
can we talk about this a second?

16:56.928 --> 17:00.106
No. I can't afford to know
these people as people.

17:00.149 --> 17:01.368
I'm running a business here.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.022
But they arepeople.

17:03.065 --> 17:06.286
If I make an exception for every
sad story, where does it end?

17:07.504 --> 17:08.940
Have you looked
at this building?

17:08.984 --> 17:11.030
If you live here,
you have a sad story.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.467
And now I rely
on this building

17:13.510 --> 17:16.252
to survive.
That's my sad story.

17:16.296 --> 17:20.735
We are this close to having
a working fountain.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.520
I'm done talking.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.175
Evict him, or I'll
find somebody who will.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.394
Well, then...

17:28.395 --> 17:30.527
I quit.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.705
I may hate my job,
but I don't have to hate myself.

17:34.749 --> 17:37.447
And by the way,
whatever part of you

17:37.491 --> 17:39.928
that's comfortable throwing
a blind man out on the street

17:39.971 --> 17:42.409
is maybe the part your husband
ran screaming from.

17:44.150 --> 17:47.022
I'm sorry, I know this screws
us, but I just couldn't do it.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.155
No, no, no,
don't be sorry.

17:49.198 --> 17:53.072
I'm so glad you didn't let her
turn you into a horrible person.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.770
Well, back into one.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.817
And maybe we end up crashing
at Adam's for a while.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.123
Totally.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.343
Sure.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.171
I'm not heartless.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.870
I just don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.394
I'm alone, I'm scared.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.180
I haven't worked in 32 years,

18:14.223 --> 18:15.833
and now I got to
run this crapbox.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.403
I mean, is this who I am now?

18:20.447 --> 18:23.624
No, no, it's not who you are.

18:23.667 --> 18:27.106
It's just what you're doing on
the road to who you're gonna be.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.238
What?

18:29.282 --> 18:33.808
Okay, your husband left you, but
that's not Mr. Munson's fault.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.288
Just like it's not your fault

18:35.331 --> 18:37.420
that I'm not doing
what I want to do.

18:38.813 --> 18:41.511
It made sense in the bathroom.

18:41.555 --> 18:45.646
Look, two strong,
smart women like us

18:45.689 --> 18:48.431
can put our heads together and
come up with a reasonable plan

18:48.475 --> 18:50.259
where you get the rent
you so richly deserve

18:50.303 --> 18:52.087
and he gets to keep
his apartment.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.046
I'd be open to that.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.396
Thank you.

18:56.439 --> 18:57.962
I'm not a monster.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.834
Though there is a kid
on the third floor

18:59.877 --> 19:01.357
with a bunny
that needs to go.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.402
You got it,
the kid's out of here.

19:02.445 --> 19:05.361
I meant the bunny.Better.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.756
This is working out
a lot like Ski Academy.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.679
The discount card
we found in the mail

19:18.722 --> 19:20.463
actually did work for
your prescription.
Mm.

19:20.507 --> 19:24.815
The GoFundMe page is...
hanging in there.

19:24.859 --> 19:27.296
It might've helped if you hadn't
paraded around the building

19:27.340 --> 19:29.298
wearing a
"No Fat Chicks" T-shirt.

19:29.342 --> 19:33.824
Well, how the hell am I supposed
to know what my T-shirts say?

19:33.868 --> 19:37.959
And for the record, I do like
a little meat on the bones.

19:38.002 --> 19:41.223
Well, I'll try
and get the word out.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.139
I'll also help you run errands
so you don't have to take a cab.Mm.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.838
And Rita is willing to let you
pay off the back rent over time.

19:47.882 --> 19:51.190
Mm. So this Rita...

19:51.233 --> 19:52.974
is she a good-looking woman?

19:53.017 --> 19:56.804
Yeah, she's very...What the hell?!

19:56.847 --> 19:58.893
You didn't tell me
the little one was here!

19:58.936 --> 20:00.242
