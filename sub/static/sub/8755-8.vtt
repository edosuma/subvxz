WEBVTT

00:10.333 --> 00:12.334
Her face was all, like, demonic.

00:12.434 --> 00:15.169
I felt hands yank me up.

00:16.004 --> 00:17.504
Yeah, so, the way
she's trying to kill her

00:17.606 --> 00:19.006
is try to get her to kill herself.

00:20.109 --> 00:21.742
Bodies were starting to float ashore

00:21.844 --> 00:23.110
up and down this entire area.

00:24.213 --> 00:26.413
There is a lot of dead around.

00:27.449 --> 00:28.782
She died in a fire.

00:28.884 --> 00:29.850
How do you know that, honey?

00:29.952 --> 00:31.418
She told me.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.220
And it killed... I think
it killed everybody.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.663
The dead girl...
she's always watching.

00:36.763 --> 00:39.464
There's a dark presence.

00:39.566 --> 00:41.600
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.702 --> 00:43.602
These things, they're freaking out.

00:43.704 --> 00:45.003
They're from hell.

00:45.105 --> 00:46.104
I see dead people.

00:46.206 --> 00:47.372
They were being hunted.

00:47.474 --> 00:49.140
I speak to dead people.

00:49.243 --> 00:51.042
They were setting people on fire,

00:51.144 --> 00:52.177
burning them alive.

00:52.279 --> 00:53.678
And they speak to me.

00:53.780 --> 00:54.980
Her neck got broken.

00:55.082 --> 00:57.949
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.051 --> 00:59.951
I hear a gunshot.

01:00.053 --> 01:01.519
I rely on my partner.

01:01.622 --> 01:02.654
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.756 --> 01:04.822
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.925 --> 01:06.057
Something's not right here.

01:06.159 --> 01:09.427
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.529 --> 01:10.595
It's not safe here.

01:10.697 --> 01:11.696
It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.798 --> 01:13.265
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:13.367 --> 01:14.399
They're all buried here.

01:14.501 --> 01:16.868
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.970 --> 01:18.904
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.006 --> 01:20.305
Until the very end...

01:20.407 --> 01:21.606
I can't do it no more.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.642
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.744 --> 01:24.912
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

01:25.012 --> 01:26.378
Or time to get out.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.846
It does not have a happy ending.

01:27.948 --> 01:30.115
Something kills people here.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:45.099 --> 01:48.100
I'm in the seaside
town of North Beach, Maryland.

01:48.202 --> 01:50.436
It's about 45 minutes
south of Annapolis.

01:50.538 --> 01:53.238
I got a call from a
woman who was hysterical.

01:53.341 --> 01:54.973
She says whatever's in the house

01:55.076 --> 01:56.608
is attacking her
6- year-old daughter.

01:56.711 --> 01:59.345
She thinks the little girl is in danger,

01:59.447 --> 02:01.447
and she can't think of
anywhere else to turn.

02:01.549 --> 02:04.183
She says we're literally her last hope.

02:11.603 --> 02:12.802
Before Amy arrives,

02:12.904 --> 02:14.971
I clear the area of
any leading information,

02:15.073 --> 02:17.473
removing religious
symbols, family photos,

02:17.575 --> 02:21.010
and other personal items that
could influence her findings.

02:21.112 --> 02:25.548
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:34.848 --> 02:37.783
Okay.

02:40.221 --> 02:44.022
There's, like, a lot of darkness here.

02:45.559 --> 02:48.594
Even if the sun is shining,
it's not really shining.

02:48.696 --> 02:51.563
It's, like, stormy and dark,

02:51.665 --> 02:55.367
and there's all of
these unresolved issues.

02:55.469 --> 02:58.870
There's a lot of fighting.

02:58.973 --> 03:01.640
There's a lot of dead around.

03:12.286 --> 03:13.288
Caren, when
we spoke on the phone,

03:13.388 --> 03:14.354
you were pretty upset

03:14.456 --> 03:16.122
about what's going on in the house.

03:16.224 --> 03:17.056
Yes.

03:17.158 --> 03:18.891
Most people think I'm crazy,

03:18.993 --> 03:20.660
but it's hard to do battle

03:20.762 --> 03:22.695
with an enemy you don't understand.

03:22.797 --> 03:24.430
Okay.

03:24.532 --> 03:27.900
Give me a list of what you
guys are experiencing here.

03:28.002 --> 03:30.236
There are things
moving around the house.

03:30.338 --> 03:31.738
We're hearing voices.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.840
We have all had nightmares.

03:33.942 --> 03:36.008
We've seen full apparitions.

03:36.111 --> 03:38.378
Now things are getting physical.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.079
Now, who's living in
the house here with you?

03:42.851 --> 03:44.650
My oldest daughter, Laurel, who's 14,

03:44.753 --> 03:47.275
my middle daughter, Aspen, who's 8,

03:47.375 --> 03:50.510
and my youngest
daughter, Cedar, who is 6.

03:50.612 --> 03:52.445
We spoke on the phone.
I know you're married.

03:52.547 --> 03:55.548
Yes, my husband works for
the Department of Defense,

03:55.650 --> 03:58.251
and he travels a lot,
so he's rarely here.

03:58.353 --> 03:59.385
Okay.

03:59.487 --> 04:01.855
Now, do you know any
history about the house?

04:01.957 --> 04:04.891
I know the owner that we
bought the property from.

04:04.993 --> 04:07.260
She was an older lady. She had polio.

04:07.362 --> 04:09.028
Okay. So when did you
move here, exactly?

04:09.130 --> 04:11.865
We bought the property in 2007.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.499
And did you guys have experiences

04:13.602 --> 04:15.001
from the minute you moved in?

04:15.103 --> 04:16.336
No.

04:16.438 --> 04:18.036
For some reason,

04:18.139 --> 04:21.741
things started happening
once Cedar turned 3.

04:24.279 --> 04:25.511
Let's talk about her. What's going on?

04:25.614 --> 04:26.913
She has drawn pictures.

04:27.015 --> 04:27.780
What kind of pictures?

04:27.883 --> 04:29.110
I have some right here.

04:29.210 --> 04:31.643
And this is the man with the brown arms.

04:31.745 --> 04:34.313
He lives in her room, in her closet.

04:34.415 --> 04:35.647
Oh, geez. All right.

04:35.749 --> 04:37.816
This one she saw in my bathroom.

04:37.918 --> 04:39.117
It was a man covered with mud.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.022
And I have a book with over 40 drawings.

04:44.124 --> 04:46.625
She has become anxious and depressed.

04:46.727 --> 04:49.428
We've seen psychiatrists
and psychologists.

04:49.530 --> 04:52.197
They all say she's a normal little girl,

04:52.299 --> 04:54.433
but she says things

04:54.535 --> 04:57.369
that 5- and 6-year-old
children should not be saying.

04:57.471 --> 05:01.373
Thank you. I'm sorry. No, don't be.

05:03.851 --> 05:05.550
I love her with all
my heart, but at times,

05:05.652 --> 05:08.186
I just... I don't
know who she is.

05:08.288 --> 05:11.706
This is pretty... heavy.

05:11.806 --> 05:13.539
How are you handling it?

05:13.641 --> 05:14.907
Not very well.

05:15.009 --> 05:17.977
When I'm alone, I do a lot of crying.

05:18.079 --> 05:21.948
I feel isolated. I feel exhausted.

05:22.050 --> 05:23.179
How are the other two kids handling

05:23.279 --> 05:24.812
all this stuff that
you and her, you know?

05:24.914 --> 05:28.950
There's a lot of fighting, a
lot of blaming, blaming her.

05:29.052 --> 05:31.519
"It's your fault this is all going on."

05:31.621 --> 05:37.291
So it's a very hard
environment to live in at times.

05:37.394 --> 05:40.995
I feel so upset for you and
what you're going through.

05:41.097 --> 05:43.164
We're willing to do whatever it takes.

05:43.266 --> 05:44.665
We're ready.

05:44.768 --> 05:48.002
Okay.

05:48.104 --> 05:51.572
I just hear crying and crying.

05:51.674 --> 05:54.776
I don't think that people around here

05:54.878 --> 05:58.613
can really maintain good
family relationships.

05:58.715 --> 06:04.185
The fighting is huge... a
huge, huge, huge problem.

06:05.255 --> 06:07.321
Oh, oh.

06:07.424 --> 06:10.958
There's a male. He's all dark right now.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.528
He's, like, standing in the shadows.

06:13.630 --> 06:14.962
He's very angry.

06:15.064 --> 06:16.597
Yeah, this is bad.

06:22.205 --> 06:23.438
Why'd you bring me in here?

06:23.540 --> 06:25.706
The day that I talked
to you on the phone,

06:25.809 --> 06:28.276
only a couple hours later,
I was in the kitchen.

06:28.378 --> 06:32.880
And I opened the cupboard,
and before doing anything,

06:32.982 --> 06:37.084
all the dishes and the
bowls fell on top of me.

06:37.187 --> 06:39.520
Was this here? Yes.

06:39.622 --> 06:40.822
And these support clips were here?

06:40.924 --> 06:41.622
Yes.

06:41.724 --> 06:43.024
Well, I can't figure out

06:43.126 --> 06:44.358
what the hell would have did that.

06:44.461 --> 06:46.727
Has anything else in this
kitchen happened here?

06:46.830 --> 06:49.230
Yes. My daughter Laurel
and I were right here,

06:49.332 --> 06:52.200
having a conversation,
and all of a sudden,

06:52.302 --> 06:54.202
she screamed, and I said,

06:54.304 --> 06:55.336
"What's wrong? What's wrong?"

06:55.438 --> 06:57.405
She said, "Someone just
touched me on my back,"

06:57.507 --> 06:59.540
and there was no one else in the room.

06:59.642 --> 07:03.878
It was just her and I.

07:03.980 --> 07:06.280
Okay. There's something creepy.

07:06.382 --> 07:09.283
I'm thinking maybe
it came out of the TV.

07:12.155 --> 07:15.559
There's this, like, woman.
She had, like, long hair.

07:15.659 --> 07:16.825
She was all wet.

07:16.927 --> 07:18.827
Her face was all, like, demonic.

07:18.929 --> 07:20.562
But she's young. I know she's young.

07:20.664 --> 07:25.066
And there's a relationship
with a living woman,

07:25.168 --> 07:28.103
probably like my age, maybe.

07:28.205 --> 07:30.839
Something weird is
going on with these two.

07:32.876 --> 07:36.945
The dead girl... she's always
watching, always watching.

07:38.281 --> 07:41.916
People would see her moving.

07:42.018 --> 07:44.018
As a woman? What
do you think they see?

07:44.121 --> 07:50.091
More along the lines of
like a shadowy figure.

07:50.193 --> 07:53.995
This girl's just messed up.
Her head is just messed up.

07:54.097 --> 07:56.064
Oh, this isn't good.

08:02.205 --> 08:03.638
What's going on in here?

08:03.740 --> 08:07.142
I have had several scary
experiences in this room.

08:07.244 --> 08:10.777
I was woken by a noise, and immediately,

08:10.877 --> 08:17.949
I looked to the door and
saw a giant black shadow

08:18.051 --> 08:20.385
coming at me from the door.

08:20.487 --> 08:24.190
Came over the bed and came
straight overtop of me.

08:24.384 --> 08:25.698
I was scared to death.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.198
I've never been that scared in my life.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.766
What else is happening up here?

08:28.868 --> 08:29.867
I was asleep,

08:29.969 --> 08:34.538
and I felt a hand grab
my hair and yank me up.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.898
It was a very aggressive pull.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.065
I screamed,

08:39.168 --> 08:40.801
and I did not go back
to sleep after that.

08:40.903 --> 08:41.768
There was no one around.

08:41.870 --> 08:42.869
Tim wasn't here.

08:42.971 --> 08:44.203
You're sure it wasn't
a nightmare that you...

08:44.306 --> 08:45.972
It was not a nightmare.

08:46.074 --> 08:47.274
How the hell are you dealing with this?

08:47.376 --> 08:49.309
I don't sleep most nights,

08:49.411 --> 08:52.345
but I'm glad that I had the experience.

08:52.447 --> 08:53.049
Why?

08:53.149 --> 08:55.816
Because I understand what
Cedar's going through.

08:55.918 --> 08:57.785
If I saw that every night,

08:57.887 --> 08:59.386
I think I'd act like her, too.

09:03.993 --> 09:06.093
I hear "mother."

09:06.196 --> 09:07.695
This is weird.

09:07.797 --> 09:14.879
This dead girl feels like the
living woman here is her mother.

09:16.014 --> 09:19.215
Okay. Oh, boy.

09:22.351 --> 09:27.929
The feeling in here is loss
and loneliness, isolation,

09:27.936 --> 09:32.239
extremely depressed,
like there's nothing left.

09:32.341 --> 09:33.340
Okay.

09:33.442 --> 09:36.409
She wants this woman all to herself,

09:36.512 --> 09:40.614
and she's doing everything in
her power to make that happen.

09:40.716 --> 09:41.548
Aah!

09:46.421 --> 09:48.021
So, that was a warning.

09:48.123 --> 09:49.489
What happened?

09:49.591 --> 09:51.191
She kind of hit me in my neck.

09:51.293 --> 09:54.352
At least I know I'm on
the right track with this.

09:54.452 --> 09:57.754
The dead younger woman is
trying to kill the living woman

09:57.856 --> 10:01.157
because she wants to be with her.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.116
I was talking to your daughter.

10:21.216 --> 10:22.315
I got to tell you,

10:22.417 --> 10:24.176
listening to her talk about
what's going on with Cedar,

10:24.276 --> 10:25.842
that really broke my heart.

10:25.944 --> 10:28.578
Absolutely. Something's
going on with Cedar.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.414
She's changed dramatically

10:31.516 --> 10:32.983
in the last year, year and a half.

10:33.085 --> 10:36.720
To do this to my
grandchildren makes me angry.

10:36.822 --> 10:37.687
You spend time here, I guess.

10:37.789 --> 10:38.955
- Lots of time here.
- You do?

10:39.057 --> 10:40.190
We live right down the street.

10:40.292 --> 10:41.725
Have you experienced anything?

10:41.827 --> 10:43.693
My husband and I
were babysitting here.

10:43.719 --> 10:44.185
Okay.

10:44.262 --> 10:48.565
And we heard Cedar cry
out, yelling and screaming,

10:48.667 --> 10:50.934
"Stop it, stop it. Leave
me alone, leave me alone."

10:51.036 --> 10:56.840
So I rubbed her back, and
she went back into her sleep,

10:56.942 --> 11:00.643
and then I heard a low voice say,

11:00.746 --> 11:03.513
"It's gonna be all
right. It's all right."

11:03.615 --> 11:06.783
Okay. Do you remember if it
was a male or a female voice?

11:06.885 --> 11:09.019
- It sounded male.
- Okay.

11:09.121 --> 11:11.359
What are you hoping to get
out of this investigation?

11:12.115 --> 11:13.648
I've thought long and hard about this,

11:13.750 --> 11:16.350
and peace among the girls.

11:16.452 --> 11:18.486
They don't tend to get along,

11:18.588 --> 11:21.522
and it's more than just sibling rivalry.

11:21.624 --> 11:22.957
There's something else.

11:23.059 --> 11:25.159
Do you think they're
in physical danger here?

11:25.261 --> 11:26.961
Yes, I do.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.367
The dead younger woman...

11:34.304 --> 11:39.540
she is coming in, being
creepy and malicious.

11:39.642 --> 11:45.079
I think it's out of jealousy
because she wants Mommy.

11:45.181 --> 11:48.482
She doesn't want children to distract.

11:51.554 --> 11:53.888
But, okay, so, the
interesting thing is...

11:53.990 --> 11:56.257
the dead guy who was in
the shadows downstairs

11:56.359 --> 11:57.258
just came in.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.060
He wants to stop.

11:59.162 --> 12:04.065
This is completely uncalled for,
and it's disgusting, he says.

12:06.301 --> 12:08.335
He's trying to reach the kids.

12:09.033 --> 12:12.267
He's trying to communicate with them,

12:12.370 --> 12:15.037
and he's trying to make them listen,

12:15.139 --> 12:18.273
and he's trying to teach them
how to stay away from her.

12:19.010 --> 12:22.912
So he is requesting that
God put a stop to this.

12:29.888 --> 12:31.087
So, Cedar, I
was talking to Mommy,

12:31.189 --> 12:33.122
and she told me that
she's worried about you.

12:34.325 --> 12:37.126
Okay. She says sometimes
you get angry at things.

12:37.228 --> 12:38.961
Do you recall any of that stuff?

12:39.064 --> 12:39.996
You remember that?

12:41.466 --> 12:42.298
Why do you think that happens, honey?

12:42.400 --> 12:43.599
I don't want to get angry.

12:43.702 --> 12:45.001
You don't want to get angry.

12:45.103 --> 12:47.670
- All of a sudden, you get angry.
- Okay.

12:47.772 --> 12:50.273
Okay, would you mind telling
me about what you're seeing?

12:50.375 --> 12:52.709
I had, like, this dream last night.

12:52.811 --> 12:54.410
I was going to Mom's room,

12:54.512 --> 12:55.845
and there was blood on the floor,

12:55.947 --> 12:58.781
and there was dead
people there...

12:58.883 --> 13:02.752
a man, there was a woman,
and there was a little girl.

13:02.854 --> 13:05.188
I was so freaked out. I didn't like it.

13:05.290 --> 13:07.390
Okay. So, what else are
you seeing, sweetheart?

13:12.897 --> 13:14.030
He yells at me.

13:14.132 --> 13:15.531
When he yells at you,
what's he tell you?

13:15.633 --> 13:18.534
He says, "Get out of here.

13:18.636 --> 13:21.003
<i>This is not your room. This is my room."</i>

13:21.106 --> 13:24.741
Okay. He sounds very mean.

13:24.843 --> 13:27.376
We're gonna have to straighten
him out and get rid of him.

13:27.479 --> 13:29.011
Okay, anything else, honey?

13:29.114 --> 13:32.081
I looked over, and,
like, this little girl...

13:32.183 --> 13:33.883
her name's Stacie...
she was hitting me.

13:33.985 --> 13:36.319
So, this little girl, is she a spirit,

13:36.421 --> 13:37.487
or is she a real person?

13:37.589 --> 13:38.755
She's a spirit.

13:38.857 --> 13:41.991
I know how she died. She died in a fire.

13:42.093 --> 13:43.092
How do you know that, honey?

13:43.194 --> 13:45.795
- 'Cause she told me.
- She did?

13:45.897 --> 13:47.096
Where does she hit you?

13:47.198 --> 13:49.866
She, like, hits me all
here and here and here.

13:49.968 --> 13:50.900
Okay.

13:51.002 --> 13:53.369
And do you get her to stop somehow?

13:53.471 --> 13:55.538
- No, I can't.
- You can't, huh?

13:55.640 --> 13:58.574
'Cause when I tell her stop,
she just keeps on doing it.

13:58.676 --> 14:01.677
Okay. We're gonna try to
get rid of her, too, okay?

14:01.780 --> 14:04.514
Would that make you happy?

14:04.616 --> 14:06.482
Okay.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.885
The living person in this room

14:08.987 --> 14:10.920
can hear the dead man talking to them.

14:11.022 --> 14:13.843
So the person
in here is aware of him?

14:13.943 --> 14:16.143
Like, I don't know if
it's through dreams.

14:16.245 --> 14:17.444
I don't know if it's
direct communication.

14:17.546 --> 14:19.980
I don't know, but on some level,

14:20.082 --> 14:23.884
yes, very much so, they've talked.

14:23.986 --> 14:26.620
The dead younger woman,
she does come in here.

14:26.722 --> 14:27.421
Boy, does she.

14:27.523 --> 14:29.022
She has to try harder here,

14:29.124 --> 14:32.726
'cause the protection
seems more aggressive.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.762
She's more visual here.

14:35.864 --> 14:37.898
She manifests here.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.935
She is louder here because
she can't get close.

14:49.245 --> 14:51.145
So, Aspen,
sweetie, how old are you?

14:51.247 --> 14:53.681
- 8 years old.
- You're 8, huh?

14:53.783 --> 14:56.350
Now, Mommy also said that
you're seeing things, as well.

14:56.452 --> 14:57.351
Mm-hmm.

14:57.453 --> 14:59.854
There is a shadow man in my room.

14:59.956 --> 15:04.658
He sits there, over by that dresser.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.627
What did it look like? Did
it look like a grown person?

15:06.729 --> 15:10.839
Yeah, it looked like a grown-up,
and it was like a person.

15:10.865 --> 15:11.891
Okay.

15:11.968 --> 15:13.334
And he just sits staring and looks at me

15:13.436 --> 15:15.236
and maybe watches out for me.

15:15.338 --> 15:17.404
Okay, so that's one
thing you've experienced.

15:17.506 --> 15:18.472
What else has happened?

15:18.574 --> 15:19.874
Well, I was in bed,

15:19.976 --> 15:24.044
and then I saw a little
girl over by my ribbons.

15:24.146 --> 15:26.580
She had brown hair, and she
was looking out the window,

15:26.682 --> 15:29.830
and she was twirling her
hair, and she was wet.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.329
- She was wet?
- Mm-hmm.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.598
Maybe she was about to go to sleep,

15:33.700 --> 15:35.634
but she was in the water or something.

15:35.736 --> 15:37.302
Okay. Anything else, honey?

15:37.404 --> 15:41.940
I was in my bed, and
then, all of a sudden,

15:42.042 --> 15:47.312
I felt a thumb press on the
back of my neck really hard.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.756
Okay. Were any
of the animals...

15:48.856 --> 15:50.155
your dogs in the house in bed with you

15:50.257 --> 15:51.657
or anything like that?

15:51.759 --> 15:53.574
No. The dogs weren't in bed with me.

15:53.674 --> 15:55.706
Oh. Sounds like you got
some scary things going on.

15:55.806 --> 15:56.738
Mm-hmm.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.829
Do you want to move from here?

15:57.929 --> 16:01.254
A little bit so I can
feel like a normal girl

16:01.354 --> 16:03.254
and always don't be scared of the dark.

16:03.356 --> 16:04.889
Okay.

16:08.795 --> 16:10.028
Okay.

16:10.130 --> 16:11.463
So we've got problems

16:11.565 --> 16:14.399
with the under-the-bed
issue here with her.

16:14.501 --> 16:17.001
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:17.104 --> 16:20.705
She slides down, goes
right under the bed,

16:20.807 --> 16:21.673
won't let them sleep.

16:21.775 --> 16:24.175
Like, I see her hands coming up.

16:27.514 --> 16:31.850
So, I don't know if she's
grabbing feet and arms,

16:31.952 --> 16:34.219
and she's messing with the head.

16:35.322 --> 16:36.788
Like, it's [bleep] terrifying.

16:36.890 --> 16:39.557
And they know that she's under the bed.

16:41.461 --> 16:43.361
I'm getting mad.

16:43.463 --> 16:45.830
Bad, bad, bad.

16:58.262 --> 17:01.017
Caren says she bought
the house from a disabled woman.

17:01.117 --> 17:03.718
Turns out the lady's
name was Mary Sullivan.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.051
Now, I made a few calls

17:05.154 --> 17:06.354
and managed to track down her cousin,

17:06.455 --> 17:07.454
who agreed to meet with me.

17:07.557 --> 17:09.357
He told me that her time there

17:09.459 --> 17:12.159
was filled with nothing
but heartbreak and pain.

17:16.398 --> 17:18.665
My clients bought that house

17:18.768 --> 17:19.767
from your cousin Mary Sullivan.

17:19.868 --> 17:21.167
Right.

17:21.271 --> 17:22.710
You spent time at the
house when Mary was there?

17:22.736 --> 17:23.095
Yes.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.138
Did you ever experience
anything that you can't explain?

17:25.241 --> 17:26.339
No.

17:26.442 --> 17:28.809
Okay. Did Mary ever
mention anything to you?

17:28.912 --> 17:32.647
No. I don't recall anybody
saying they had any issues.

17:32.749 --> 17:33.981
- Anything they can't explain?
- Right.

17:34.083 --> 17:34.982
Okay.

17:35.084 --> 17:36.384
So, John, do you have any idea

17:36.486 --> 17:38.119
when your family actually
purchased the property?

17:38.221 --> 17:39.186
I do.

17:39.289 --> 17:41.656
My grandfather bought
the property in 1919,

17:41.758 --> 17:45.660
and this is what it
looked like about 1934.

17:45.762 --> 17:47.421
Wow. It's so different.

17:47.521 --> 17:49.288
Mary... let's talk about her.

17:49.390 --> 17:50.822
What kind of personality was she?

17:50.925 --> 17:53.759
Oh, she was very outgoing,
very pleasant, very happy.

17:53.861 --> 17:56.495
Here's her graduation
picture from high school.

17:56.597 --> 17:57.729
She's a pretty girl.

17:57.831 --> 17:58.931
Yeah, she is a very pretty girl.

17:59.033 --> 18:00.198
On the phone,

18:00.301 --> 18:01.934
you mentioned that she
had a rough go of things.

18:02.036 --> 18:03.635
Yes, yes.

18:03.737 --> 18:05.012
When she was 20,

18:05.112 --> 18:07.676
she got engaged to a
midshipman at the naval academy.

18:07.776 --> 18:11.277
And here's the midshipman
that she was engaged to.

18:12.347 --> 18:15.281
And everything was going
well until the following year,

18:15.383 --> 18:16.950
after she turned 21.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.552
Then, she was diagnosed with polio,

18:19.654 --> 18:22.422
and she wore a brace from
her hip down to her ankle.

18:22.524 --> 18:24.491
He broke the engagement.

18:24.593 --> 18:26.558
- She ever meet anybody else?
- No.

18:26.658 --> 18:27.724
She never went out of her way

18:27.826 --> 18:29.693
to look for another
romantic relationship.

18:29.795 --> 18:32.295
So, did she live alone in
that house all those years?

18:32.397 --> 18:34.331
Yes, but she kept herself busy,

18:34.433 --> 18:37.834
in the church and the
Democratic Woman's Society.

18:37.936 --> 18:39.836
So, John, I know she
sold the house in 2007.

18:39.938 --> 18:41.438
How soon after that did she pass?

18:41.540 --> 18:44.774
About two years later, after
her 75th birthday party.

18:44.877 --> 18:48.145
Here are a couple of
pictures from that party.

18:48.247 --> 18:50.680
She passed away a
couple months after that.

18:50.782 --> 18:52.115
It was a total surprise.

18:52.217 --> 18:53.884
What was the official
cause of death with Mary?

18:53.986 --> 18:55.886
- It was a heart attack.
- Okay.

18:55.988 --> 18:57.454
That's a shame.

18:57.556 --> 19:00.591
One major disease just
changed her life completely.

19:00.617 --> 19:01.550
Absolutely.

19:05.364 --> 19:08.131
So, there's this old woman.

19:08.233 --> 19:09.466
Has this person passed?

19:09.568 --> 19:11.868
She's dead, yes.

19:11.970 --> 19:14.337
The old lady looks very alive,

19:14.439 --> 19:18.341
so I'm gonna say, you
know, she's pretty recent.

19:18.443 --> 19:22.479
Oh damn she's in some
kind of pain, I tell you what.

19:26.118 --> 19:27.184
Can you describe her?

19:27.286 --> 19:29.252
Kind of grandma heavy, I guess.

19:29.354 --> 19:31.888
Her hair was kind of gray-white.

19:31.990 --> 19:35.859
She is, like, aware of,
like, this bad stuff.

19:35.961 --> 19:37.127
And, then,

19:37.229 --> 19:39.930
there's this whole thing about
religion creeping back in.

19:40.032 --> 19:41.998
She was, like, praying
and talking about demons,

19:42.100 --> 19:45.268
and I think she's talking
about the dead younger woman.

19:45.370 --> 19:49.005
I think she saw her when she was alive,

19:49.107 --> 19:51.808
'cause she really
thinks that she's evil.

19:53.278 --> 19:55.312
So, here's what I know so far.

19:55.414 --> 19:58.615
I've got a family of four being
terrorized by bizarre activity

19:58.717 --> 20:01.351
on a property whose former
owner suffered from polio

20:01.453 --> 20:03.253
and died of a heart attack.

20:03.355 --> 20:04.654
But I need to see if
there's anything else

20:04.756 --> 20:07.390
that could help my investigation.

20:07.492 --> 20:08.658
Searching through old records,

20:08.760 --> 20:10.827
I find an article about
another former owner

20:10.929 --> 20:12.963
named Maurice Dougherty.

20:13.065 --> 20:17.200
Turns out he died in a fire that
started inside Caren's house.

20:19.738 --> 20:21.104
I'm heading over to
meet with a genealogist

20:21.206 --> 20:24.307
who says Maurice Dougherty's
life was as tragic as his death.

20:30.516 --> 20:31.548
This guy Maurice Dougherty...

20:31.651 --> 20:32.816
What did you find out about him?

20:32.918 --> 20:37.184
Well, he purchased that house
as a vacation home in 1930.

20:37.284 --> 20:40.485
- He himself was very wealthy.
- Okay.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.987
He was a contractor and owned
his own plumbing company.

20:43.089 --> 20:44.289
What happened with the fire?

20:44.391 --> 20:48.526
The night of the fire
was October 16, 1932.

20:48.552 --> 20:49.585
Okay.

20:49.663 --> 20:52.697
It was cool enough to need some heat,

20:52.799 --> 20:56.668
so before he retired, he
turned on an oil stove.

20:56.770 --> 20:57.869
Okay.

20:57.971 --> 21:00.220
But he put it in his
bedroom, close to his bed.

21:00.855 --> 21:02.721
While he was sleeping,

21:02.823 --> 21:05.710
his sheets caught on fire
'cause they were too close.

21:05.810 --> 21:07.543
When the firefighters arrived,

21:07.645 --> 21:09.078
they knocked in the front door,

21:09.180 --> 21:13.682
and they found him dead with
the key still in his hand.

21:13.785 --> 21:15.050
So this poor [bleep]
was trying to get out

21:15.153 --> 21:16.152
with the key and never made it.

21:16.254 --> 21:17.153
Never made it.

21:17.255 --> 21:18.387
According to his death certificate,

21:18.489 --> 21:23.533
they have the cause of death
suffocation by inhalation.

21:23.633 --> 21:28.869
And so the sister became
the executor of his estate.

21:28.971 --> 21:34.274
However, the estate was sued
by a woman that came forward

21:34.377 --> 21:36.744
and presented herself as his wife.

21:36.846 --> 21:38.545
But there's no proof

21:38.648 --> 21:41.782
or documentation or marriage license,

21:41.884 --> 21:44.150
so the sister kept the property.

21:44.250 --> 21:45.382
Do we know if the cops ever looked at

21:45.484 --> 21:46.850
this woman claiming to be his wife

21:46.952 --> 21:48.452
for maybe setting the whole thing up

21:48.554 --> 21:49.653
to look like an accident?

21:49.755 --> 21:50.788
That is a good question.

21:50.890 --> 21:52.956
I don't know if she was interviewed

21:53.059 --> 21:55.759
or ever a suspect in this.

21:55.861 --> 21:58.295
But his background as a contractor,

21:58.397 --> 22:01.598
would he have been that reckless

22:01.700 --> 22:05.202
to put a stove so close to your bed?

22:06.205 --> 22:08.906
The guy who tries to protect the living

22:09.008 --> 22:13.944
is taking it upon himself
to protect the children.

22:14.047 --> 22:16.781
So, do you get anything
on this guy in life?

22:16.883 --> 22:22.820
He was some kind of architect
or a builder of some sort.

22:22.922 --> 22:26.757
I think he died in his 40s, 50s.

22:26.859 --> 22:30.628
He feels like he was put
out to dry or something.

22:30.730 --> 22:34.265
I think he got himself
into a bad situation and...

22:34.367 --> 22:36.534
What do you mean?

22:36.636 --> 22:38.002
He kind of feels like he was murdered,

22:38.104 --> 22:40.638
but I don't know if he's
really showing me the truth,

22:40.740 --> 22:47.078
because I feel like he
did himself in, you know,

22:47.178 --> 22:49.078
and he's not taking responsibility.

22:49.180 --> 22:52.014
Maybe he was wrongfully murdered.

22:58.957 --> 23:00.189
If you need us to investigate

23:00.292 --> 23:01.924
unexplained activity in your home,

23:02.027 --> 23:04.627
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

23:04.729 --> 23:06.529
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

23:06.631 --> 23:07.764
and we'll help if we can.

23:16.512 --> 23:19.052
You know, another thing caught
my attention in research.

23:19.152 --> 23:22.219
There was a deadly boat accident
right near Caren's house,

23:22.322 --> 23:24.649
14 dead.

23:24.749 --> 23:27.616
I'm on my way to meet
with a maritime historian

23:27.718 --> 23:29.551
who's gonna tell me
exactly what happened.

23:36.861 --> 23:38.694
I wanted to talk to you
about this article I found

23:38.796 --> 23:40.496
in regards to a boat wreck

23:40.598 --> 23:42.297
that happened right by
my client's property.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.632
What can you tell me
about what happened?

23:43.734 --> 23:46.301
The ship originally
was used to haul cargo.

23:46.404 --> 23:48.737
This is the picture of her right there.

23:48.839 --> 23:49.872
Okay.

23:49.974 --> 23:53.876
In 1954, a guy named John Mecklin bought

23:53.978 --> 23:56.311
and converted the
straight-hulled schooner

23:56.414 --> 23:57.613
into a cruising ship.

23:57.715 --> 23:59.581
Here's a picture of
John Mecklin right here.

24:01.118 --> 24:02.785
What do we know about this guy?

24:02.887 --> 24:04.186
He really had very, very little

24:04.288 --> 24:06.855
or almost no maritime
experience whatsoever,

24:06.957 --> 24:08.490
but bought the ship.

24:08.592 --> 24:11.026
He says, "I can make a great business

24:11.128 --> 24:13.550
going up and down the
Chesapeake Bay with passengers."

24:13.650 --> 24:17.418
So he spends a little bit
of money repairing the ship,

24:17.520 --> 24:19.487
but it was a very, very bad job.

24:19.589 --> 24:21.823
It was very sloppy, and as a result,

24:21.925 --> 24:24.158
the ship really was not seaworthy.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.626
And for the next few years,

24:25.728 --> 24:28.615
it operated up and down the
bay in this new and popular way

24:28.665 --> 24:30.234
that people enjoyed
themselves called cruising.

24:30.334 --> 24:32.334
Take me through the day of the tragedy.

24:32.436 --> 24:33.535
Monday the 8th of August,

24:33.637 --> 24:36.705
they set sail with 23
passengers and a crew of 4.

24:36.807 --> 24:38.039
Little do they know

24:38.141 --> 24:40.875
that Hurricane Connie's
moving up this way.

24:40.977 --> 24:43.712
Friday, the 12th of August, 1955.

24:43.814 --> 24:44.946
The hurricane hits.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.048
The winds were well
over 60 miles an hour.

24:47.150 --> 24:49.718
Waves probably were a good 8 to 12 feet,

24:49.820 --> 24:52.721
which is huge in a bay like this.

24:52.823 --> 24:56.291
Once he recognizes that it's
time to get some protection,

24:56.393 --> 24:59.828
he comes sailing
across and tries to moor

24:59.930 --> 25:01.563
right up by your client's place.

25:01.665 --> 25:04.499
He drops anchor, but the ship capsizes,

25:04.601 --> 25:05.967
the passengers all go flying out,

25:06.069 --> 25:08.203
and the ship is
literally torn to pieces.

25:08.305 --> 25:11.039
All the passengers are
grabbing hold of wreckage

25:11.141 --> 25:12.841
to try and save themselves.

25:12.943 --> 25:15.043
Here's a picture of the
actual rescue effort.

25:15.145 --> 25:18.680
- Some make it. 14 don't.
- Wow.

25:18.782 --> 25:19.914
Bodies were starting to float ashore

25:20.016 --> 25:21.539
up and down this entire area.

25:21.639 --> 25:22.704
Okay, so, the captain...

25:22.807 --> 25:24.139
was he ever held accountable
for what happened?

25:24.241 --> 25:26.074
He was very fortunate
to have a good lawyer.

25:26.177 --> 25:28.877
He was found guilty of
four counts of negligence,

25:28.979 --> 25:31.747
was given suspended sentence
and on probation for a year.

25:31.849 --> 25:32.714
That's it.

25:32.817 --> 25:36.318
- Aw, geez.
- Yeah. Terrible tragedy.

25:41.492 --> 25:43.792
So, I'm getting some weird stuff.

25:43.894 --> 25:48.397
Kind of looks like a hairy man,

25:48.499 --> 25:53.669
but it seems to kind of
be, like, running around...

25:55.072 --> 25:59.741
kind of like an ape on the knuckles.

25:59.844 --> 26:03.312
This might have just been
a regular guy at some point.

26:03.414 --> 26:05.347
I guess he's taken on this appearance

26:05.449 --> 26:07.282
to kind of like be intimidating,

26:07.384 --> 26:10.586
trying to keep living people away.

26:10.688 --> 26:14.723
There is something about
a crash, like a boat.

26:16.293 --> 26:18.627
This boat accident happened
a very long time ago

26:18.729 --> 26:20.262
with this guy.

26:20.364 --> 26:22.831
I'm just seeing like, rain
and [bleep] and he's yelling,

26:22.933 --> 26:25.200
and I'm hearing all
these people yelling.

26:25.302 --> 26:28.403
He was in charge of a boat,
and it sank or something,

26:28.505 --> 26:31.139
and it killed... I think
it killed everybody.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.053
During my walk, I saw
several dead people,

26:44.155 --> 26:46.188
but the young woman
attacking the living child

26:46.291 --> 26:48.858
has me the most concerned.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.694
I saw this woman under the bed.

26:54.332 --> 26:57.199
Her face is all black. It's all black.

27:03.941 --> 27:09.545
She's grabbing this child
and is torturing her.

27:18.723 --> 27:20.122
Is this what you saw?

27:20.224 --> 27:22.925
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:41.975 --> 27:44.331
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:44.431 --> 27:46.298
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:46.400 --> 27:48.400
and our clients for the first time.

27:50.025 --> 27:51.358
Amy, I'd like you to meet Caren,

27:51.460 --> 27:53.393
and this is her mom, Jan.

27:53.495 --> 27:55.629
Her story really touched my heart.

27:55.731 --> 27:58.131
Now, her husband works for
the Department of Defense

27:58.233 --> 28:01.201
and is overseas most of the time.

28:01.303 --> 28:03.236
Now, Jan lives down the street,

28:03.338 --> 28:05.005
- so Caren's here alone...
- Okay.

28:05.107 --> 28:08.341
With a hell of a lot of activity.

28:08.443 --> 28:09.609
And she's got three young girls

28:09.711 --> 28:12.545
that are being affected
tremendously by it.

28:12.648 --> 28:16.049
This is Laurel, who's 14.

28:16.151 --> 28:18.385
This is Aspen, who's 8.

28:18.487 --> 28:20.086
And this is Cedar, who's 6.

28:20.188 --> 28:23.556
This is the one Caren's
most worried about.

28:23.659 --> 28:24.724
Caren believes

28:24.826 --> 28:28.194
this is literally a
life-and-death situation.

28:28.297 --> 28:29.472
So now that Amy knows

28:29.572 --> 28:31.405
a little bit about the family dynamics,

28:31.507 --> 28:32.940
I'm gonna ask her to describe her walk.

28:36.244 --> 28:39.345
When I first got
here, I was at the door,

28:39.447 --> 28:44.350
and I was seeing a lot of negativity,

28:44.452 --> 28:47.220
like, actually rolling in.

28:47.322 --> 28:50.156
That negative energy can cause people

28:50.258 --> 28:54.294
to feel very unsettled
and kind of unstable here.

28:54.396 --> 28:57.063
It can cause massive fighting.

28:57.165 --> 28:58.364
Wow.

28:58.466 --> 29:00.667
The fighting...

29:00.769 --> 29:02.635
My three girls fight all the time,

29:02.737 --> 29:08.007
and I constantly am trying
to keep everyone calm.

29:08.109 --> 29:11.978
And then I end up yelling,
and we're all yelling,

29:12.080 --> 29:14.614
and it comes out of nowhere,
and especially for Cedar.

29:14.716 --> 29:16.349
It's constant.

29:16.451 --> 29:19.752
It's a challenge every day
to bring them back down.

29:21.856 --> 29:22.855
It's heartbreaking.

29:26.461 --> 29:28.961
So, what else did you see?

29:29.064 --> 29:31.831
I met a male,

29:31.933 --> 29:35.468
and he was in the kitchen
and dining room area.

29:35.570 --> 29:38.137
He seemed to be in his 40s, 50s.

29:38.239 --> 29:41.507
I got that he was in
building or construction.

29:41.609 --> 29:42.675
He was yelling at me
that he had been murdered

29:42.777 --> 29:45.311
and all this bad stuff
had happened to him,

29:45.413 --> 29:46.913
and, like, just something about him,

29:47.015 --> 29:51.201
I was like, "I don't
know if that's true."

29:51.301 --> 29:54.369
But, later, I saw him elsewhere,

29:54.471 --> 29:56.938
and he seems to be going out of his way

29:57.040 --> 29:59.604
to try to protect people here.

30:00.677 --> 30:02.510
Well, there's really
not a lot to go on here,

30:02.612 --> 30:03.912
but there is somebody who lived here

30:04.014 --> 30:06.948
that was in construction, and
he died a mysterious death.

30:07.050 --> 30:08.616
His name was Maurice Dougherty.

30:08.718 --> 30:10.185
He was a wealthy contractor,

30:10.287 --> 30:13.988
and he bought this property
back in 1930 as a summer home.

30:14.091 --> 30:16.291
So, now, back on October 16, 1932,

30:16.393 --> 30:17.592
he was sleeping here,

30:17.694 --> 30:19.627
and it was a cold night
for that time of the year,

30:19.729 --> 30:22.864
so he set up a stove and
put it next to his bed

30:22.966 --> 30:24.232
to keep himself warm.

30:24.334 --> 30:26.901
Now, at some point in the
night, the sheets caught on fire.

30:27.003 --> 30:28.837
He was overcome by smoke,

30:28.939 --> 30:31.072
and by the time the firemen got here,

30:31.174 --> 30:32.774
he was DOA.

30:32.876 --> 30:36.845
Now, they found him on
the floor, locked inside,

30:36.947 --> 30:39.247
with the key to the door in his hand.

30:40.746 --> 30:42.502
I actually have an
article about his death.

30:42.602 --> 30:44.635
Wow.

30:44.737 --> 30:47.104
Now, he was 49 years old.

30:47.206 --> 30:48.673
He apparently lived here alone.

30:48.775 --> 30:50.608
I got the death certificate.

30:50.710 --> 30:53.444
His sister winded up
getting the property.

30:53.546 --> 30:55.212
But here's where the
story gets a little weird.

30:55.315 --> 30:57.315
After Maurice died,

30:57.417 --> 31:00.685
this mystery woman came forward
and claimed to be his widow.

31:00.787 --> 31:04.188
She wanted a piece of the house,
I guess whatever money he had,

31:04.290 --> 31:06.657
but she couldn't provide
any documentation or proof

31:06.759 --> 31:07.925
that she was married to this guy,

31:08.027 --> 31:10.227
and the sister didn't
know who the hell she was.

31:10.330 --> 31:13.197
So when you say he
feels like he was murdered,

31:13.299 --> 31:15.032
I'm not so sure the death went down

31:15.134 --> 31:17.535
the way the cops and the
firemen saw it that night.

31:17.637 --> 31:19.804
First of all, the guy's
a seasoned contractor.

31:19.906 --> 31:21.105
Are you gonna be stupid enough

31:21.207 --> 31:22.907
to put an oil heater
right next to your bed?

31:23.009 --> 31:24.742
- Right.
- I'm speculating.

31:24.844 --> 31:27.078
Maybe she was staying here
with him, locks the door on him.

31:27.180 --> 31:28.613
Now she wanted to go after his money.

31:28.715 --> 31:29.814
Wow.

31:29.916 --> 31:31.182
Did you guys know about any of this?

31:31.284 --> 31:34.418
- No. No idea.
- Okay.

31:39.092 --> 31:41.125
Now, you said this guy's
protecting the family.

31:41.227 --> 31:42.660
What's he protecting them from?

31:42.762 --> 31:45.596
The main issue here is
that there's a dead woman.

31:45.698 --> 31:49.600
She had very long hair. She was wet.

31:49.702 --> 31:52.570
I saw her coming out
from that television.

31:54.107 --> 31:56.974
People would see her moving...

31:57.076 --> 32:00.144
like a shadowy figure.

32:02.081 --> 32:04.715
She's always watching.

32:04.817 --> 32:05.983
Oh.

32:06.085 --> 32:08.419
But what concerned me

32:08.521 --> 32:13.157
was what she was doing
upstairs in the yellow room.

32:13.259 --> 32:14.125
Cedar's room.

32:14.227 --> 32:15.426
She was there.

32:15.528 --> 32:19.430
She was extremely agitated
because the protector,

32:19.532 --> 32:21.532
the dead man, is there.

32:21.634 --> 32:24.135
What he told me was that he's
trying to teach the children

32:24.237 --> 32:27.104
how to stay away from
the creepy, dead woman.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.273
He said he's not trying to scare them.

32:29.375 --> 32:31.776
He's trying to make them listen.

32:31.878 --> 32:34.945
So the dead lady tries
to be more aggressive,

32:35.048 --> 32:36.847
but she can't break through the barrier.

32:36.949 --> 32:38.215
Wow.

32:38.317 --> 32:41.018
Cedar is the biggest
reason Caren called us in.

32:41.120 --> 32:44.221
And you hit on a lot of the
things she's experiencing,

32:44.323 --> 32:46.424
and there's a lot.

32:46.526 --> 32:47.992
Your daughter mentioned
the guy with the brown arms

32:48.094 --> 32:49.393
coming out of the ceiling.

32:49.495 --> 32:51.028
Cedar says that he yells at her.

32:51.130 --> 32:53.330
He tries to push her out of bed.

32:53.433 --> 32:54.598
He's very threatening.

32:54.701 --> 32:56.367
It scares her.

32:56.469 --> 32:58.402
Interesting, interesting.

32:58.504 --> 33:00.004
Even though it seems harsh,

33:00.106 --> 33:02.573
I think that's just his way
of trying to protect her.

33:02.675 --> 33:03.908
Okay.

33:04.010 --> 33:06.043
Jan was watching Cedar,

33:06.145 --> 33:07.945
and she was screaming in her crib.

33:08.047 --> 33:09.213
Tell her what you heard.

33:09.315 --> 33:10.381
She was screaming,

33:10.483 --> 33:12.283
"Get out, get out. Leave me alone."

33:12.385 --> 33:15.086
And as we were walking out of the door,

33:15.188 --> 33:17.088
I heard a low voice,

33:17.190 --> 33:18.756
"Everything's gonna be all right."

33:18.858 --> 33:20.491
Interesting. Okay.

33:20.593 --> 33:24.261
I got sketches that she's drawn.

33:24.363 --> 33:27.331
This is the man with the brown arms.

33:29.202 --> 33:30.835
That's a bloody man.

33:30.937 --> 33:32.536
Okay.

33:32.638 --> 33:33.904
She also has drawn one

33:34.006 --> 33:35.906
that had a gunshot through the head.

33:36.008 --> 33:38.142
Really?

33:38.244 --> 33:40.077
The drawings she makes are horrible.

33:40.179 --> 33:42.046
How many spirits?

33:42.148 --> 33:43.247
Has she seen?

33:44.417 --> 33:45.216
Over a hundred.

33:46.919 --> 33:47.651
A hundred.

33:47.754 --> 33:49.086
It's every night.

33:49.756 --> 33:51.422
Geez.

33:52.859 --> 33:55.326
Your daughter... I think
she's a physical medium.

33:58.064 --> 34:00.164
And that's what
Amy is, by the way.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.801
Oh, my God.

34:05.505 --> 34:07.104
Oh, my gosh.

34:07.206 --> 34:09.440
There is other elements to the ability.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.275
We're able to affect our environment.

34:11.377 --> 34:11.524
Typically,

34:11.623 --> 34:15.532
it's when we're highly
emotional, angry, sad.

34:15.632 --> 34:18.032
And if people live with us,

34:18.135 --> 34:21.221
they will have
experiences at some point.

34:22.335 --> 34:23.969
She has daily rages.

34:24.071 --> 34:27.806
She became very, I would
say, at times violent.

34:27.908 --> 34:28.907
Yes.

34:29.009 --> 34:32.744
Totally different little girl.

34:32.846 --> 34:35.414
When dead people come to her,

34:35.516 --> 34:37.616
she is experiencing their lives.

34:37.717 --> 34:39.184
This is some heavy stuff

34:39.286 --> 34:41.954
for a child to be
absorbing and witnessing,

34:42.056 --> 34:43.822
and that's why you're seeing

34:43.924 --> 34:47.518
the behavioral reactions constantly.

34:47.719 --> 34:52.313
This is all just shocking and confusing.

34:53.475 --> 34:58.945
I knew her behavior was
unusual for a 6-year-old,

34:59.047 --> 35:01.447
but this is really heavy.

35:01.549 --> 35:04.784
No wonder she's anxious and depressed.

35:04.886 --> 35:07.353
She doesn't know what to
expect around every corner.

35:13.854 --> 35:15.187
I went into the pink room.

35:15.289 --> 35:17.355
That's Aspen's room.

35:17.458 --> 35:18.757
The protector said

35:18.859 --> 35:21.226
that he wasn't able
to get through to her.

35:21.328 --> 35:22.761
Therefore, the dead woman

35:22.863 --> 35:26.731
was a little bit more
active in that room...

35:26.834 --> 35:29.267
the dead woman who's
laying under the bed,

35:29.369 --> 35:32.270
trying to grab her feet and her arms

35:32.372 --> 35:34.339
and messing with her hair.

35:34.441 --> 35:36.842
And the protector was
standing in the room,

35:36.944 --> 35:39.511
telling me how angry
he was about everything,

35:39.613 --> 35:41.513
saying it was uncalled
for and disgusting,

35:41.615 --> 35:45.784
and he was asking God to
put a stop to this behavior.

35:47.020 --> 35:50.655
Many nights, Aspen sees
a little girl in her room.

35:51.649 --> 35:54.951
She has long, curly, brown hair.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.853
And the hair is wet, isn't it?

35:56.955 --> 35:58.821
It's wet, yes.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.490
And one time,

36:00.592 --> 36:06.329
she felt a thumb press
into the back of her neck.

36:06.431 --> 36:08.231
And there's someone who watches her

36:08.333 --> 36:10.199
from the corner of her room.

36:10.301 --> 36:11.534
She said there's a shadow?

36:11.636 --> 36:14.837
A shadow, yes, every night.

36:14.939 --> 36:18.241
Well, I did a sketch of what I saw.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.009
Oh, my gosh.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.113
I have to show you this.

36:29.321 --> 36:31.388
Oh, my gosh.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.323
This is my granddaughter
going through this.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.859
It's heart-wrenching.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.295
That's exactly what she describes.

36:38.397 --> 36:44.268
She says it's like fingers
going down her legs.

36:44.370 --> 36:47.704
What the hell does
this woman want with the kids?

36:50.175 --> 36:52.175
When I went into the
master bedroom.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.077
I figured out a lot of stuff.

36:54.179 --> 36:58.949
I felt a living woman
feeling very isolated,

36:59.051 --> 37:02.419
lost in depression.

37:02.521 --> 37:03.554
You are feeling this.

37:03.656 --> 37:06.790
Yes. Those were the exact words I used.

37:06.892 --> 37:10.060
What I got was that the dead woman

37:10.162 --> 37:15.532
is making everyone feel this
way to tear the family apart.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.234
That's what she wants.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.036
The reason why she's doing this

37:19.138 --> 37:21.538
is because she wants
you to be her mother.

37:21.640 --> 37:22.940
What?!

37:24.443 --> 37:26.577
She's jealous
of the other children.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.912
That's why she torments them.

37:29.014 --> 37:33.383
While all of this was happening
and I'm figuring this out,

37:33.485 --> 37:35.919
like, she just, like,
split-second, like,

37:36.021 --> 37:38.989
karate-chopped me in the neck.

37:39.091 --> 37:43.260
She is very capable
of doing physical harm.

37:45.431 --> 37:49.166
Well, I've been attacked in my room.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.300
Really?

37:50.402 --> 37:53.937
I was sleeping, and all of a sudden,

37:54.039 --> 37:56.106
a big chunk of
hair... whoo!...

37:56.208 --> 37:59.376
pulled me up off my pillow.

37:59.478 --> 38:03.480
Scared the living daylights out of me.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.149
Now, is this little
[bleep] doing that to her?

38:06.251 --> 38:09.252
Yeah. She's the main problem here.

38:09.355 --> 38:11.221
She wants to be with you.

38:11.323 --> 38:15.125
The only way she can be with you
is if you were to kill yourself.

38:15.227 --> 38:18.662
Then you guys would
spend eternity together,

38:18.764 --> 38:20.864
and you would forever
be her mother, alone.

38:22.868 --> 38:23.900
Oh, my God.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.236
Wow!

38:26.338 --> 38:28.405
Yeah.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.040
I thought what I was experiencing

38:30.142 --> 38:33.270
was just fallout from Cedar.

38:35.014 --> 38:37.427
I just can't believe this is happening.

38:54.792 --> 38:57.368
So, Caren, when we spoke,
you looked me right in the eye

38:57.468 --> 38:58.767
and said you'll do whatever it takes

38:58.869 --> 39:00.435
to protect your kids.

39:00.537 --> 39:01.870
It sounds like after tonight,

39:01.972 --> 39:03.605
you need some help yourself.

39:03.707 --> 39:05.040
Yes.

39:05.142 --> 39:07.275
Now, we're gonna find
out what it's gonna take

39:07.378 --> 39:08.810
to make that happen.

39:08.912 --> 39:09.978
So for that,

39:10.080 --> 39:12.647
I'm gonna turn it over
to Amy for some answers.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.550
So, the first thing
I would like to see happen

39:15.652 --> 39:19.521
is contacting a Native
American, a medicine person,

39:19.623 --> 39:22.791
to do a cleansing and remove the dead

39:22.893 --> 39:25.994
that are here in the house.

39:26.096 --> 39:30.699
Then, I would like for you to
have a Reiki master come in,

39:30.801 --> 39:33.168
and what they're going to be doing

39:33.270 --> 39:35.303
is removing any attachments.

39:35.406 --> 39:36.738
Basically,

39:36.840 --> 39:41.910
they're gonna be removing all
of that built-up negative energy

39:42.012 --> 39:43.612
and releasing that,

39:43.714 --> 39:46.248
cutting any cords that have formed.

39:46.350 --> 39:51.086
Now, for your daughter Cedar,

39:51.188 --> 39:56.358
the first thing is for her to
learn meditation techniques.

39:56.460 --> 39:59.060
This is very, very important here.

39:59.163 --> 40:02.063
Really, when she starts
doing the meditation,

40:02.166 --> 40:03.799
her light basically will dim,

40:03.901 --> 40:07.169
and the dead won't be as
drawn to her as they have been.

40:07.271 --> 40:09.037
Okay.

40:09.139 --> 40:12.948
The second thing is for
her to have a power object.

40:13.048 --> 40:14.681
Now, this is an object

40:14.783 --> 40:19.619
that she's going to feel
protects her and empowers her

40:19.721 --> 40:22.155
that she can carry with
her anywhere and everywhere

40:22.257 --> 40:24.867
and she can sleep with it, et cetera.

40:24.967 --> 40:26.733
The third thing is...

40:26.835 --> 40:29.769
we're gonna call it the
room lock-down, okay?

40:29.871 --> 40:33.073
So every night, she's
gonna have her power object,

40:33.175 --> 40:35.542
and she's gonna have her mantra, okay?

40:35.644 --> 40:39.112
So what she's gonna say is
something along the lines of

40:39.214 --> 40:41.615
"Leave me be. I'm too young to help.

40:41.717 --> 40:44.951
Go to another. You cannot be here.

40:45.053 --> 40:47.587
You cannot speak to
me. You cannot jump me.

40:47.689 --> 40:49.856
You must stay outside."

40:49.958 --> 40:52.025
And that will keep them from coming?

40:52.127 --> 40:52.792
Yes.

40:52.894 --> 40:54.060
This is the basis

40:54.162 --> 41:00.066
of her starting her
process of self-empowerment,

41:00.168 --> 41:01.768
drawing her boundaries,

41:01.870 --> 41:05.071
and making sure that
her space is her own.

41:05.173 --> 41:07.007
We have a path,

41:07.109 --> 41:09.502
and this family will follow the path.

41:10.075 --> 41:11.040
At least you're smiling now.

41:12.344 --> 41:16.379
It's good to have some
answers to know what to do.

41:16.481 --> 41:17.580
I feel like,

41:17.682 --> 41:20.616
"Okay, we have a path ahead,
and if we do these things,

41:20.719 --> 41:22.452
we're all gonna feel better."

41:22.554 --> 41:25.021
That's what I want.

41:25.123 --> 41:27.623
I want my little girl to
feel like a little girl.

41:28.460 --> 41:30.193
I really feel for Caren.

41:30.795 --> 41:33.229
Learning that your child
can interact with the dead

41:33.331 --> 41:34.563
can be terrifying.

41:34.665 --> 41:36.966
But I believe if they follow my advice,

41:37.068 --> 41:39.368
Cedar will learn to
harness her abilities.

41:39.470 --> 41:42.671
And with the help of a Reiki
master and a medicine person,

41:42.773 --> 41:46.229
they can banish the dead
and live a peaceful life.
