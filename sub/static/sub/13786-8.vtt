Razor rainl

01:25.878 --> 01:27.618
Everyone movel

02:27.439 --> 02:29.179
Little Wotf.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.657
is for the good of all.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.909
Mrs Tarr...

11:03.079 --> 11:04.660
We don't want any trouble.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.323
You don't belong here.

11:08.752 --> 11:09.787
Not now.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.504
L'rttle Wotf.

11:19.763 --> 11:22.755
Sukar is dead.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.941
Sukar has left us.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.574
His spirit has ﬂown to join lrzu.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.536
Sukal‘s ﬂesh will melt away.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.539
His bones will remain to adorn this place.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.371
But we will keep him alive

13:17.547 --> 13:19.037
in our minds

13:19.883 --> 13:22.090
and in our hearts.

13:24.971 --> 13:28.429
His belongings must precede him.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.242
This broth is his puriﬁcation.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.166
It will spare his bones

14:00.840 --> 14:02.626
and return the three elements

14:03.301 --> 14:06.384
of his body to nature.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.308
Through this body flows the path

15:38.771 --> 15:41.103
to lrzu.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.780
lrzu must have sent him back to us.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.615
Are you blind?

17:16.953 --> 17:18.113
It‘s a curse.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.911
The broth meils the ﬂesh.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.789
This is not our Sukar.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.074
This is impossible.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.455
This new planet is impossible.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.216
Little Wolf.

42:14.991 --> 42:16.856
Take good care of him.

42:17.619 --> 42:20.406
Always, Little Wolf.
