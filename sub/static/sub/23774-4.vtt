[theme music playing]

00:27.750 --> 00:28.870
[building rumbling]

00:38.710 --> 00:39.710
[whirring]

00:42.370 --> 00:43.620
Very unexpected.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.290
Tingly.

00:47.750 --> 00:48.750
[screaming]

00:54.120 --> 00:54.870
[panting]

00:55.460 --> 00:56.290
Did you guys see those?

00:57.170 --> 00:58.330
What the bloody hell was that?

00:58.790 --> 00:59.830
I think they were stars.

01:01.670 --> 01:02.670
Do you know where we are?

01:03.960 --> 01:04.710
No idea.

01:06.330 --> 01:09.620
Look, this room is Egyptian.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.620
We just need to find
our bearings.

01:13.870 --> 01:14.710
Make a--

01:16.580 --> 01:18.250
-Huh.
-Oh, what the...

01:20.210 --> 01:21.460
Why didn't it stay open?

01:22.460 --> 01:24.420
There is no connection.
Nothing.

01:24.420 --> 01:25.120
[James Beal grunts]

01:26.370 --> 01:27.580
This seems promising.

01:29.920 --> 01:30.670
[Catherine grunts]

01:31.290 --> 01:32.290
Turn it back on, Cat.

01:33.830 --> 01:35.210
I rather not
stay here too long.

01:36.170 --> 01:36.920
Sure.

01:37.670 --> 01:38.420
All right.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.250
Okay, one.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.580
[gasps] Oh.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.460
At least getting back will be
a little less exhausting.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.170
Yes.

01:53.540 --> 01:54.290
Four.

01:56.670 --> 01:57.420
Five.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.960
Six. Seven, seven.

02:01.540 --> 02:02.750
Seven.

02:04.830 --> 02:05.750
Seven.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.120
There's no seven symbol.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.540
What, what does that mean?

02:11.960 --> 02:14.040
Uh, the triangle
with a dot over it.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.830
Yeah, it's not here.

02:18.330 --> 02:21.580
Maybe, maybe this site
has a different seven symbol.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.420
So, so all of them
were in that Nazi journal,right?

02:25.460 --> 02:27.370
So maybe what we need now
will also be in there.

02:28.370 --> 02:29.120
Yes.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.290
Maybe.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.830
The floor is wet.
The floor is wet.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.420
Okay. Thank you.
It's good to know.

02:40.120 --> 02:43.290
-You're both are being
very helpful.
-James, please calm down.

02:43.750 --> 02:44.620
[James Beal] Calm down?

02:46.040 --> 02:48.420
You could have landed us
all on Mars.

02:48.420 --> 02:49.120
[Wasif] Excuse me.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.500
I do not believe this is Mars.

03:01.420 --> 03:02.170
What do I know?

03:02.540 --> 03:03.420
I've never been.

03:06.540 --> 03:09.790
Wherever we are,
let's treat it like hostile
territory.

03:10.870 --> 03:11.790
-Wasif.
-Huh.

03:12.040 --> 03:12.830
Join me on a sweep.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.330
Cat, stay put.

03:15.330 --> 03:16.330
[scoffs] You wish.

03:42.790 --> 03:43.540
Anything?

03:44.620 --> 03:46.290
No. Nothing yet.

03:57.540 --> 03:58.290
[Beal] Cat?

04:08.750 --> 04:12.670
Do you have any idea
what kind of danger you've put
us in?

04:12.670 --> 04:14.710
How was I supposed
to know the sequence here would
be different?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.500
It's not my journal.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.790
You didn't think to check
before dragging us along--

04:18.790 --> 04:19.500
[Wasif clears throat]

04:19.500 --> 04:21.080
[both] What?

04:21.080 --> 04:22.830
Any clue?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.500
Footprints and a dead Nazi.

04:24.790 --> 04:25.750
You?

04:25.750 --> 04:26.870
[gulps] Hmm?

04:29.250 --> 04:30.670
I found another bucket.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.580
-Wasif, I swear--
-Come on, let's go.

04:34.960 --> 04:35.710
Cat, wait.

04:37.920 --> 04:38.870
Cat, wait.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.670
We've not secured this...

04:42.080 --> 04:43.620
Do you even know
how to use that thing

04:44.330 --> 04:46.210
other than clobbering people
over the head with it?

04:46.460 --> 04:48.750
[Catherine] I learned to shoot
when I was 15 years old.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.960
-Oh, wow.
-Thank you.Thank you.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.460
[Catherine] When was the last
time you fired it?

04:52.460 --> 04:53.580
[growling]

04:57.000 --> 04:58.790
Just don't be a hero.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.210
-Only if I have to save you.
-[body thuds]

05:15.580 --> 05:16.330
Here we go.

05:18.670 --> 05:21.080
Wasif, you about mate?

05:21.500 --> 05:22.710
Can't seem to find you.

05:23.170 --> 05:25.420
Just follow the sound
of my voice.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.080
James. [shushes]

05:28.830 --> 05:29.960
Over here.

05:45.540 --> 05:46.290
[bullet ricochet]

05:48.290 --> 05:49.040
[growling]

06:15.540 --> 06:16.540
[grunts]

06:28.710 --> 06:30.170
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:57.670 --> 06:58.420
[Wasif screams]

07:03.000 --> 07:03.750
-[growls]
-[grunts]

07:11.790 --> 07:12.580
[speaks in foreign language]

07:24.830 --> 07:25.580
[gunshot]

07:29.790 --> 07:32.080
Thank you, Wasif.
Great shot.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.120
[sighs] I got her.

07:34.710 --> 07:35.460
How?

07:35.790 --> 07:36.540
Hit her with this.

07:38.460 --> 07:39.210
Hold on to it.

07:40.330 --> 07:41.330
What was that?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.960
No women back home
can fight like that.

07:44.830 --> 07:45.790
No man, either.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.750
You...
[chuckles]

07:53.170 --> 07:54.500
You had to be a hero.

07:55.210 --> 07:56.710
You needed saving.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.250
Okay, what was that?

07:58.750 --> 08:01.750
Oh, over here.
Listen to the sound of my voice.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.330
It's called strategy.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.080
Strategy, is it?

08:05.330 --> 08:06.790
Is that, is that
what you call it?

08:06.790 --> 08:08.670
Oh, from what I saw
it was, like...

08:10.250 --> 08:11.830
[speaking in foreign language]

08:20.540 --> 08:21.370
He looks so human.

08:22.580 --> 08:23.330
Boo!

08:26.040 --> 08:28.580
Well, he's no threat at least.

08:30.620 --> 08:31.710
Figure out
what he's on about, Cat.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.210
Hi. Hello.

08:36.170 --> 08:39.170
Just what are you
trying to tell us?

08:39.920 --> 08:40.750
[speaking in foreign language]

08:44.750 --> 08:45.500
[mouths] What?

08:46.870 --> 08:49.210
Do you have any idea
what he's yammering about?

08:49.210 --> 08:51.000
I think he wants us
to follow him.

08:51.670 --> 08:53.330
It almost sounds
like the old--

08:53.330 --> 08:55.620
Wasif, just give me a second.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.670
What are you trying to say?

09:00.920 --> 09:02.080
[continues speaking
in foreign language]

09:09.580 --> 09:10.620
Maybe the kid knows something.

09:12.210 --> 09:15.710
About the dead Nazi.
About the woman we just fought.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.750
About what happened
to your father.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.290
What about my father?

09:19.290 --> 09:21.960
Cat, your father's
an old man.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.790
We really ought
to consider the possi--

09:36.290 --> 09:37.170
Sorry.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.040
[whirring]

09:41.290 --> 09:42.250
Here we go again.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.170
We need to go.

09:43.170 --> 09:43.920
Now.

09:44.710 --> 09:45.790
[speaking in foreign language]

09:47.170 --> 09:48.620
What the bloody hell
is wrong with you?

09:48.620 --> 09:49.750
Wasif, help me.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.210
[man screaming in protest]

09:52.120 --> 09:53.120
Thank us later.
