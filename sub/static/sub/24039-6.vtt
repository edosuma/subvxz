WEBVTT

00:09.943 --> 00:11.532
Previously on <i> The Arrangement...</i>

00:11.533 --> 00:13.566
"Technicolor Highway," we
need to focus on that.

00:13.568 --> 00:16.268
And the fact that your co-star
clearly has feelings for you.

00:16.271 --> 00:18.638
You know that was just
about the work, right?

00:19.123 --> 00:20.889
<i>I never thought
Lisbeth would just</i>

00:20.891 --> 00:21.990
<i>bail on me at our wedding.</i>

00:21.992 --> 00:23.392
Did she ever explain herself?

00:23.393 --> 00:25.022
Something about getting
lost in my world.

00:25.046 --> 00:26.329
Why are you following me?

00:26.354 --> 00:27.790
I just wanna know why you left.

00:27.832 --> 00:28.879
Was it Terence?

00:28.904 --> 00:30.204
You can't separate
them, it's impossible.

00:30.206 --> 00:31.505
Why would you say that?

00:31.507 --> 00:32.840
<i>Whatever she's accessing,</i>

00:32.842 --> 00:34.508
it's pretty deep in the vault.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.742
I don't wanna spend
an entire weekend

00:36.744 --> 00:38.273
pushing IHM on national TV.

00:38.274 --> 00:39.773
He booked us on "Iris Holloway."

00:39.775 --> 00:41.541
He wants you to do more press?

00:41.543 --> 00:42.856
He also wants you to do it.

00:43.345 --> 00:45.746
I can't watch Terence
control Kyle anymore.

00:46.102 --> 00:47.514
I'm ready to meet your friends.

00:47.516 --> 00:50.670
Ten years ago, a girl named
Julie Wolfe joined IHM.

00:50.695 --> 00:52.428
And then she just vanished.

00:52.617 --> 00:55.118
There's a name... It should
be in the IHM system.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.140
<i>It's the last thing I'm gonna
ask you to do, I promise.</i>

01:01.679 --> 01:02.858
<i>It was Monday.</i>

01:03.381 --> 01:04.947
<i>I'm not sure why
I remember that.</i>

01:09.035 --> 01:10.886
<i>We were scheduled to attend
a fundraiser that night</i>

01:10.888 --> 01:12.896
<i>for the Boys & Girls
Club of Los Angeles.</i>

01:13.497 --> 01:15.056
Hey, babe, you home?

01:17.979 --> 01:19.062
Lis?

01:23.952 --> 01:25.286
Hey, babe, you here?

01:31.026 --> 01:33.293
<i>This is Lisbeth.
Leave a message.</i>

01:34.845 --> 01:36.154
Just calling to check on you.

01:36.156 --> 01:37.233
Everything all right?

01:37.258 --> 01:38.523
Get back to me, okay?

01:38.525 --> 01:39.857
Yeah, hey, what's going on?

01:39.859 --> 01:41.299
You're not answering
my phone calls.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.727
Get back to me, please.

01:42.752 --> 01:45.040
I'm... I'm starting to get a
little worried about you.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.594
_

01:49.039 --> 01:50.740
_

01:52.513 --> 01:53.956
<i>She didn't tell you anything?</i>

01:54.928 --> 01:57.335
She knew the schedule. She
said she was fine with it.

01:57.598 --> 01:58.997
I don't know.

01:58.999 --> 02:00.604
Her phone's going
straight to voicemail.

02:01.969 --> 02:03.609
DeAnn, I gotta call you back.

02:07.608 --> 02:09.341
<i>I don't have it
committed to memory,</i>

02:09.342 --> 02:12.077
<i>but the basic message
of the note was that</i>

02:12.079 --> 02:13.333
<i>she loved me,</i>

02:13.975 --> 02:16.197
<i>and that she realized
my world was just</i>

02:16.967 --> 02:19.117
- <i>too big for her.</i>
- _

02:19.528 --> 02:21.119
<i>She was getting lost,
so she thought</i>

02:21.121 --> 02:23.155
<i>the best thing for
her to do was leave.</i>

02:26.336 --> 02:28.700
What did she mean
by getting lost?

02:30.364 --> 02:32.965
My life is very complex.
It's full of moving pieces.

02:33.503 --> 02:35.069
Sometimes if I'm not careful,

02:35.071 --> 02:36.237
things can get lost
in the shuffle,

02:36.239 --> 02:37.538
like intimacy.

02:37.921 --> 02:38.978
Lost...

02:39.041 --> 02:40.441
A word that isn't
foreign to you.

02:40.443 --> 02:43.644
You have had a lot of it
in your life, haven't you?

02:44.192 --> 02:45.246
Loss?

02:45.801 --> 02:47.320
Sure, my fair share.

02:47.321 --> 02:49.521
Your mother died of cancer
when you were little.

02:49.955 --> 02:53.325
You lost your father in a
car accident soon after.

02:53.573 --> 02:54.705
That's correct.

02:54.707 --> 02:56.456
So, when Lisbeth left,

02:56.804 --> 03:00.081
that must've revived a lot
of the childhood trauma.

03:02.659 --> 03:04.592
No, no,

03:04.594 --> 03:06.120
because Lisbeth wasn't dead.

03:07.694 --> 03:08.847
Let's cut.

03:09.659 --> 03:12.159
The suggestion of
death is a metaphor.

03:12.161 --> 03:14.061
I just wanna make
it really clear

03:14.063 --> 03:17.505
how high the emotional stakes
were for you when Lisbeth left.

03:17.867 --> 03:20.801
Okay, then let's be clear.
Lisbeth didn't die.

03:20.803 --> 03:22.403
I'm not interested in
sensationalizing it.

03:22.405 --> 03:23.938
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, of course not.

03:23.940 --> 03:26.674
It's just that I really wanna
dig a little bit deeper here

03:26.676 --> 03:28.599
so we can leave death out of it.

03:29.569 --> 03:31.543
Let's talk about abandonment.

03:31.637 --> 03:33.647
I mean, that's part of your
history, wouldn't you say?

03:33.649 --> 03:36.333
People that you depended
on leaving you?

03:37.612 --> 03:38.641
Yes.

03:38.644 --> 03:41.211
So, would you be
comfortable saying that

03:41.213 --> 03:43.713
the breakup with Lisbeth
played into that?

03:48.374 --> 03:50.340
- Yeah, yeah, okay, sure.
- That's great.

03:50.342 --> 03:53.144
That'll really tee us up
nicely for talking about

03:53.145 --> 03:55.478
how IHM helped you get
through all of that.

03:55.479 --> 03:57.219
Okay.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.598
And three, two...

04:01.870 --> 04:03.300
Let's talk about loss.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:14.615 --> 04:15.981
Look, you knew the
question was coming,

04:15.983 --> 04:17.346
or did you not read the notes?

04:17.785 --> 04:20.586
DeAnn usually gives us the
notes and walks us through.

04:20.588 --> 04:22.688
Yeah, well, DeAnn's not here. I
expect you to read the notes.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.172
I've got better things to do.

04:24.358 --> 04:26.215
- Did you read the notes?
- Yeah, I read the notes.

04:26.216 --> 04:28.750
Look, this isn't a pleasant
memory for any of us,

04:29.238 --> 04:30.585
but it makes you
look sympathetic.

04:30.587 --> 04:32.988
And given the rumors out
there, that's not a bad thing.

04:33.463 --> 04:34.762
This is all for
the greater good.

04:34.764 --> 04:36.731
Dress it up however
you want, man,

04:36.733 --> 04:38.566
but I'm up to my ears trying
to make this movie work

04:38.568 --> 04:40.034
and me and my cast have been
spending the entire weekend

04:40.036 --> 04:41.736
making an infomercial for IHM.

04:41.738 --> 04:43.204
Put energy into IHM,

04:43.206 --> 04:44.405
and IHM puts energy
back into you,

04:44.407 --> 04:45.706
- you know that.
- Right, right,

04:45.708 --> 04:47.441
except I don't have any
more energy to give.

04:47.893 --> 04:49.660
Sweetie, the movie's going well.

04:49.662 --> 04:51.269
You're doing a great job.

04:51.530 --> 04:53.526
We could afford to
take the weekend off.

04:54.433 --> 04:55.700
Did you miss me?

04:56.514 --> 04:59.148
I am ready to sing
some IHM praises,

04:59.150 --> 05:00.116
if you're ready for me.

05:00.118 --> 05:01.588
Amazing.

05:01.919 --> 05:03.969
Would you actually sing?

05:04.455 --> 05:06.410
Did you wanna take a look
at yesterday's scene?

05:07.544 --> 05:09.172
The movie's not going well.

05:11.813 --> 05:13.648
I'm sure you shouldn't
take that personally.

05:16.117 --> 05:17.406
What was that about?

05:17.407 --> 05:18.573
I don't exactly know,

05:18.575 --> 05:20.208
but whatever's going
on between them

05:20.660 --> 05:22.261
seems to be getting worse.

05:23.827 --> 05:24.902
Megan.

05:25.737 --> 05:27.370
Iris doesn't need you
for another hour.

05:27.372 --> 05:28.672
Now might be a good time.

05:34.954 --> 05:36.655
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.881
How's it going?

05:38.752 --> 05:39.752
Good.

05:41.030 --> 05:43.631
So, Iris Holloway, huh?

05:43.633 --> 05:44.704
Yeah,

05:44.705 --> 05:48.210
a day of professing my love for
IHM on national television,

05:48.549 --> 05:51.804
get myself back on Terence's
good side and get back to work.

05:51.805 --> 05:52.981
Right.

05:55.175 --> 05:57.676
So, I'm just checking
in to see...

05:57.836 --> 06:00.324
I know, nothing came up.

06:02.235 --> 06:03.331
Nothing?

06:03.484 --> 06:06.585
There is no record of
Julie Wolfe anywhere.

06:06.587 --> 06:07.953
I looked everywhere I could.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.040
Why didn't you tell me?

06:12.672 --> 06:14.323
I'm telling you now.

06:18.939 --> 06:20.994
And that doesn't
seem bizarre to you?

06:21.541 --> 06:22.907
What are you referring to?

06:22.909 --> 06:24.943
That there's no record
of her anywhere.

06:24.945 --> 06:26.811
People remember her, Shaun.

06:26.813 --> 06:29.547
Maybe these people
are lying to you.

06:29.549 --> 06:31.616
Or maybe Terence
is trying to hide

06:31.618 --> 06:34.124
whatever horrible
shit he did to her.

06:34.551 --> 06:36.692
Or maybe they're lying.

06:38.611 --> 06:40.144
You don't wanna go any
further with this.

06:40.146 --> 06:42.813
Megan, you asked me to do
one more thing for you.

06:42.815 --> 06:45.116
I did it, even though
I told you before...

06:45.118 --> 06:47.036
Okay, you're right.

06:49.091 --> 06:50.388
Thanks for checking.

07:10.582 --> 07:11.908
What's that for?

07:13.317 --> 07:14.503
Protection.

07:15.484 --> 07:16.698
If it was for protection,

07:16.699 --> 07:18.379
you would've used it
on me back in Fresno.

07:18.628 --> 07:20.597
You're not as dangerous
as you think.

07:21.369 --> 07:24.019
You don't know shit about
me or what I think.

07:24.172 --> 07:25.858
But I'll tell you
something I do know.

07:25.859 --> 07:27.758
People don't carry guns unless
they're looking to use them,

07:27.759 --> 07:30.561
so what the hell is your plan?

07:44.453 --> 07:47.278
<i>So, let's talk about
your last few weeks.</i>

07:47.919 --> 07:49.706
You weren't in the Institute.

07:49.707 --> 07:51.941
Your girlfriend Nasim Anand was.

07:52.362 --> 07:56.318
You two have a very
explosive, public breakup,

07:56.966 --> 07:59.500
and almost immediately
afterwards,

07:59.502 --> 08:02.929
you signed up for an
introductory workshop.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.840
The timing is weird,
I'll give you that.

08:07.032 --> 08:08.776
But the truth is,

08:09.050 --> 08:10.978
<i>I've been interested
in IHM for weeks</i>

08:11.287 --> 08:12.780
<i>since I met Kyle.</i>

08:12.782 --> 08:14.115
<i>Why, exactly?</i>

08:14.117 --> 08:15.783
<i>You are the choices you make...</i>

08:15.785 --> 08:18.986
<i>In acting, in music, in
your relationships...</i>

08:19.588 --> 08:22.022
<i>And I don't know
anybody who makes</i>

08:22.024 --> 08:23.280
<i>better choices than Kyle.</i>

08:23.509 --> 08:25.788
<i>If IHM can give me the
tools to help me improve,</i>

08:26.264 --> 08:28.030
<i>you better believe
I'm signing up.</i>

08:28.520 --> 08:30.583
That's great...

08:30.921 --> 08:32.701
I think we've got this, guys.

08:33.366 --> 08:35.068
- Thank you, Iris.
- Terrific.

08:38.571 --> 08:40.999
Xavier, you're a natural.

08:41.024 --> 08:42.541
Hey, not my first rodeo.

08:43.655 --> 08:44.839
Let's find some time to talk.

08:44.864 --> 08:46.264
I wanna hear how
the workshop went.

08:46.673 --> 08:48.209
Sure, thanks, man.

08:52.070 --> 08:54.445
Oh, no, you set the bar high.

08:54.669 --> 08:55.868
Terence should cut you a check.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.971
Nah, I'm happy to do this...

08:57.973 --> 09:00.173
Keeping my mind occupied
instead of dwelling.

09:00.731 --> 09:01.803
Nasim?

09:01.993 --> 09:03.192
She's part of it.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.707
The bigger issue is Hooper.

09:05.063 --> 09:06.690
- Your character?
- Yeah.

09:06.691 --> 09:09.065
You know, when I make
music, I just follow my gut

09:09.090 --> 09:11.260
and, I don't know, the
people, they like it.

09:11.416 --> 09:13.916
But this is like I'm playing
to an audience of one

09:13.918 --> 09:15.281
and he's never happy.

09:15.282 --> 09:16.815
Kyle loves your work.

09:17.580 --> 09:20.151
Just keep doing your thing
and take his suggestions.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.077
Right, at the end of the day,
it's still Xavier Hughes

09:23.079 --> 09:24.906
up on that screen making
all the girls cry.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.596
You ever thought about leading
a workshop around here?

09:27.598 --> 09:30.365
Yeah, no, hard pass.

09:30.550 --> 09:31.589
Hey,

09:32.011 --> 09:33.708
just wanna give you
guys a heads-up.

09:33.879 --> 09:35.779
The schedule changed.

09:35.781 --> 09:37.724
We have to reshoot
scene 16 on Monday.

09:38.022 --> 09:41.194
The scene by the car?
Why, what's wrong?

09:41.897 --> 09:43.063
When you grab her,
it's emotional,

09:43.065 --> 09:44.870
but it also has to
be compassionate.

09:45.661 --> 09:47.584
Right now, every take
is reading like anger.

09:48.442 --> 09:49.975
We're gonna lose the audience.

09:49.977 --> 09:51.343
Well, yesterday you
told me to play fear,

09:51.345 --> 09:52.727
and then it was play
love for the girl.

09:52.751 --> 09:54.391
I've tried everything
you've asked, Kyle.

09:54.479 --> 09:55.590
It's never right.

09:55.591 --> 09:56.991
It's because you're
not getting it.

09:57.234 --> 09:58.826
I don't know what "it" is.

09:59.018 --> 10:01.790
How the hell do you grab
someone with compassion, man?

10:02.404 --> 10:03.695
Like this.

10:03.972 --> 10:05.573
And you look her in the
eye and you tell her

10:05.597 --> 10:08.097
that she cannot make the
same mistakes that you did.

10:10.613 --> 10:11.968
That reads like anger.

10:18.820 --> 10:21.095
Do you really think we're
gonna lose the audience?

10:23.337 --> 10:25.336
What exactly is the
point of that question?

10:26.607 --> 10:28.078
Look, I'm sorry, it...

10:29.076 --> 10:30.576
You hired the guy because
you thought he would

10:30.578 --> 10:32.144
bring something
different to the part,

10:32.146 --> 10:34.246
so why don't you just
let him bring it?

10:34.248 --> 10:35.781
Even if what he's
doing is wrong?

10:35.783 --> 10:36.849
Well, I don't think
what he's doing

10:36.851 --> 10:38.017
is necessarily wrong...

10:38.019 --> 10:39.385
Is that what you're telling him?

10:39.387 --> 10:40.920
That what he's doing is
right and that I'm wrong?

10:40.922 --> 10:42.254
No, do you really
think that I would

10:42.256 --> 10:43.756
undermine you like that?

10:43.758 --> 10:45.428
Don't make it sound
so ridiculous, Megan.

10:45.453 --> 10:46.886
The guy leans on you.

10:46.888 --> 10:47.987
You obviously like
what he's doing.

10:47.989 --> 10:49.388
Why wouldn't you tell him that?

10:49.390 --> 10:51.323
Because you're the
director, and I trust you.

10:51.325 --> 10:52.892
What's going on?

10:52.894 --> 10:55.097
Hello, beautiful people.

10:55.396 --> 10:58.528
I'm sorry, Kyle, I need to
steal your lovely fiancée,

10:58.553 --> 10:59.566
if you don't mind.

10:59.896 --> 11:01.567
I'll just be one minute, okay?

11:01.569 --> 11:02.569
I promise.

11:08.006 --> 11:09.145
Hey...

11:11.512 --> 11:13.667
I thought we got past
all those rumors.

11:15.031 --> 11:17.175
Why all of a sudden are
you acting jealous?

11:17.367 --> 11:19.468
I'm not acting jealous.

11:21.872 --> 11:23.001
Okay.

11:24.140 --> 11:25.654
My mistake.

11:36.042 --> 11:37.066
<i>Lis?</i>

11:37.787 --> 11:39.336
Lis?

11:42.833 --> 11:44.325
Hey, babe, you home?

11:50.844 --> 11:51.882
Hey.

11:52.236 --> 11:53.271
Hey.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.514
Why haven't you
answered my text?

11:55.766 --> 11:58.416
Oh, I went to lunch
with a girlfriend

11:58.418 --> 12:00.636
and forgot my phone in the car.

12:01.331 --> 12:02.397
A girlfriend.

12:02.399 --> 12:04.165
Mm-hmm, yeah, Sarah.

12:04.167 --> 12:05.273
Not Gavin?

12:06.536 --> 12:07.744
Gavin?

12:08.382 --> 12:09.660
Really, Kyle?

12:09.661 --> 12:11.561
I know he called you a
week before the wedding.

12:11.563 --> 12:13.096
Was it a last ditch
effort to get you back?

12:13.098 --> 12:14.324
Wow, well,

12:14.325 --> 12:16.330
since you've apparently been
looking through my phone,

12:16.354 --> 12:17.927
yeah, Gavin called me.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.338
Twice.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.548
One I ignored, and
one I answered.

12:23.077 --> 12:24.951
He wished me the best.
That was it.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.539
God, honestly,

12:26.541 --> 12:27.974
I can't believe
that I really have

12:27.976 --> 12:29.142
to explain myself
to you right now.

12:29.144 --> 12:30.284
Oh, you can't?

12:30.285 --> 12:32.045
Ever since we talked,
you've been a ghost.

12:32.047 --> 12:33.113
What do you expect me to think?

12:33.115 --> 12:34.514
Kyle, our talk

12:34.516 --> 12:36.983
happened one month
before our wedding.

12:36.985 --> 12:38.752
You dropped a bomb on me, okay?

12:38.754 --> 12:40.253
That is a lot to process!

12:40.255 --> 12:42.021
Lis, the whole point
is that I've changed.

12:42.221 --> 12:43.588
Look, that's why I told you.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.492
We should be honest
with each other, okay,

12:45.494 --> 12:47.457
about everything, no secrets.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.385
Okay, honestly,

12:50.185 --> 12:52.113
I don't feel safe with you,

12:54.248 --> 12:55.580
but that doesn't mean
I'm gonna run off

12:55.582 --> 12:57.499
and have sex with somebody else.

12:58.018 --> 12:59.384
That's what you did with me.

13:00.688 --> 13:02.224
Right, right, I'm a slut.

13:02.372 --> 13:04.305
That's the problem with
this relationship.

13:04.307 --> 13:05.539
No, that's not what I'm saying.

13:05.541 --> 13:07.375
You're the problem, Kyle, you.

13:07.377 --> 13:09.010
You tell me that
you're not the man

13:09.012 --> 13:10.278
that I thought I was marrying,

13:10.280 --> 13:11.879
and now you want points
for being honest?

13:11.881 --> 13:13.247
I am the man you thought
you were marrying.

13:13.249 --> 13:14.415
No, you're not!

13:14.417 --> 13:16.284
You are a self-obsessed,
little...

13:16.286 --> 13:18.119
Stop interrupting me!

13:23.201 --> 13:24.292
I'm sorry.

13:25.298 --> 13:26.659
People don't change.

13:27.130 --> 13:28.329
- Lis, please...
- Do not...

13:28.332 --> 13:30.391
Do not come near me.

14:20.186 --> 14:21.552
Okay, now, as you know,

14:21.554 --> 14:24.030
the rumors have been
flying recently.

14:24.683 --> 14:25.825
They say

14:26.464 --> 14:28.645
you're having an affair
with your co-star,

14:29.254 --> 14:30.720
<i>that your relationship with Kyle</i>

14:30.722 --> 14:32.321
<i>is a business arrangement,</i>

14:32.323 --> 14:34.957
and that in exchange
for fortune and fame,

14:34.959 --> 14:37.060
you had to join IHM.

14:37.273 --> 14:39.362
Mm, pretty juicy...

14:39.546 --> 14:40.666
But all false.

14:41.406 --> 14:43.846
Where do rumors like
that come from?

14:44.041 --> 14:46.228
Hollywood is a creative town,

14:46.696 --> 14:48.243
but trust me,

14:48.551 --> 14:50.417
Kyle would never
turn his love life

14:50.419 --> 14:52.052
into a business transaction.

14:52.054 --> 14:54.488
He's actually a
hopeless romantic.

14:54.490 --> 14:56.999
So you never felt any pressure

14:57.024 --> 14:58.582
to join the Institute?

15:00.850 --> 15:02.293
Not from Kyle.

15:04.727 --> 15:06.127
From who, then?

15:08.927 --> 15:10.228
From myself.

15:12.553 --> 15:15.260
Here I was in love with
this huge movie star.

15:15.285 --> 15:17.944
<i>My life was suddenly
on constant display,</i>

15:17.969 --> 15:21.377
and I needed help to mute
the outside narrative

15:21.402 --> 15:24.746
and focus on how I feel about
myself and my relationship.

15:25.845 --> 15:29.344
And how exactly does the
Institute help you do that?

15:31.179 --> 15:32.578
Well, Iris, you'll have to take

15:32.580 --> 15:34.928
an introductory
workshop and find out.

15:36.943 --> 15:38.384
Not a chance.

15:39.045 --> 15:40.826
We'll cut that.

15:45.769 --> 15:47.068
You were spectacular.

15:47.070 --> 15:49.021
Yeah, aww, thanks.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.605
Do you ever not shine on camera?

15:50.607 --> 15:52.940
Oh, come on, I
appreciate that, though.

15:52.942 --> 15:54.342
- Of course.
- Megan.

15:58.254 --> 15:59.286
You remember Isaac.

16:01.424 --> 16:02.551
Hi, Megan.

16:03.325 --> 16:04.384
Hi.

16:05.799 --> 16:06.823
Shall we?

16:10.254 --> 16:11.754
Hey, you okay?

16:13.244 --> 16:15.344
- Megan, do you have a second?
- Yeah.

16:15.346 --> 16:17.513
Sorry, thank you.

16:17.515 --> 16:19.800
That guy with Terence...

16:20.218 --> 16:21.617
That's who drugged
me at the facility.

16:21.619 --> 16:23.252
What the hell is he doing here?

16:23.254 --> 16:25.287
I don't know. I'm sorry,
I can't find Kyle.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.655
What?

16:26.657 --> 16:28.057
They're almost ready for
his sit-down interview

16:28.059 --> 16:29.142
and he's gone.

16:32.064 --> 16:33.764
The Megalithic Temples of Malta

16:33.766 --> 16:35.899
have been there since 2500 BC.

16:35.901 --> 16:37.434
Just a few miles away,

16:37.436 --> 16:39.803
50-year-old houses
are falling apart.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.975
But the temples still stand.

16:44.566 --> 16:46.243
So you wanna go there
and drop acid?

16:46.245 --> 16:47.644
I did that in college.

16:47.646 --> 16:49.580
What I want is for you to
imagine the human body

16:49.582 --> 16:51.882
having the same
sort of longevity,

16:52.370 --> 16:54.885
a world where death is
no longer inevitable.

16:55.321 --> 16:56.321
Why?

16:56.322 --> 16:58.374
Because science has caught
up with our imagination,

16:58.948 --> 17:00.414
and with the proper funding...

17:00.416 --> 17:02.950
Ah, that's where I come in.

17:03.210 --> 17:04.210
Yes.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.755
My lab has isolated a
hormone called HM236,

17:07.757 --> 17:09.790
which not only protects
cells from damage,

17:09.791 --> 17:12.159
but actually
prevents cell death.

17:14.357 --> 17:15.923
You're talking
about immortality?

17:15.925 --> 17:17.417
In a manner of speaking, yes,

17:18.095 --> 17:20.194
relative to current
life expectancy.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.022
What does that mean?

17:28.529 --> 17:31.400
Another 30 years on the
average lifespan to start.

17:31.704 --> 17:32.903
Who knows? Maybe more.

17:32.905 --> 17:34.471
- The possibility...
- No, I mean,

17:34.473 --> 17:35.896
what does it mean to you?

17:36.542 --> 17:38.414
I could retire at 80,

17:38.967 --> 17:41.684
spend the next few decades
becoming a concert pianist.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.135
That's your plan?

17:44.360 --> 17:46.512
I stopped taking
lessons when I was 10.

17:47.279 --> 17:48.362
I always regretted it.

17:48.862 --> 17:51.296
Ah, there it is...

17:53.573 --> 17:54.803
The end of regret,

17:56.307 --> 17:58.336
and so much more
time to fix things.

18:00.393 --> 18:02.261
What's your biggest
regret, Terence?

18:06.353 --> 18:07.703
Send me the research.

18:28.671 --> 18:30.671
Come on, come on.

18:40.105 --> 18:41.738
Pick up, pick up.

18:42.176 --> 18:44.236
<i>This is Lisbeth.
Leave a message.</i>

19:02.251 --> 19:03.351
Come on.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.431
Come on!

19:44.956 --> 19:46.106
Hey, man.

19:49.427 --> 19:50.860
You shouldn't be here.

19:52.597 --> 19:54.053
Talk to me. What's going on?

19:54.534 --> 19:56.996
Should've never told her. I
should've never told her.

19:58.368 --> 19:59.652
I ruined everything.

20:00.270 --> 20:01.667
You ruined everything.

20:02.649 --> 20:04.331
She couldn't get past it

20:04.332 --> 20:06.799
and now she's gone because
I am a piece of shit.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.022
No, you're not.

20:08.965 --> 20:11.217
I'm calling him.
I'm calling Aaron.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.797
Put that phone down. You're
not making that call.

20:13.954 --> 20:15.000
Kyle.

20:16.248 --> 20:17.946
You're not gonna decide this.

20:28.597 --> 20:30.784
<i>I'm calling him.
I'm calling Aaron.</i>

20:31.667 --> 20:33.419
<i>We're sorry.</i>

20:33.669 --> 20:35.610
<i>Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.</i>

20:35.738 --> 20:37.820
<i>Please check the
number and dial again.</i>

20:43.392 --> 20:45.626
Kyle, give me the gun.

20:46.848 --> 20:48.225
You're not gonna shoot me.

20:48.564 --> 20:49.795
I know you.

20:50.663 --> 20:52.210
This is not who you are.

20:55.904 --> 20:58.671
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle,
you don't wanna do this.

20:58.673 --> 20:59.800
I can't...

21:00.608 --> 21:02.341
I can't get it out of me, man,

21:02.343 --> 21:04.132
this... this monster.

21:04.948 --> 21:06.712
Kyle, Kyle, it's an old story.

21:07.056 --> 21:08.214
Let it go.

21:08.653 --> 21:10.052
Focus on the right now.

21:10.054 --> 21:11.554
We have been over this.

21:11.556 --> 21:12.884
It doesn't work!

21:14.859 --> 21:16.492
<i>- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't!</i>

21:16.494 --> 21:17.894
<i>It works. You have to trust me.</i>

21:17.896 --> 21:19.313
<i>We can fix this.</i>

21:21.315 --> 21:22.759
I'm a fraud, man.

21:23.584 --> 21:25.449
- I'm a fraud.
- No, you're not.

21:25.586 --> 21:28.954
You deserve everything you
have worked so hard for.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.890
And you deserve the
love you didn't get

21:30.892 --> 21:32.791
when you were a little boy.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.627
You deserve to be loved.

21:34.944 --> 21:36.605
Nobody can love me, man.

21:42.188 --> 21:44.154
<i>Once they see who I really am,</i>

21:44.356 --> 21:46.829
what I'm capable of...
They can't love me.

21:47.748 --> 21:48.995
I love you.

21:50.796 --> 21:52.224
<i>I love you, Kyle.</i>

22:09.055 --> 22:10.269
<i>Come here.</i>

22:34.772 --> 22:36.872
<i>Everyone's waiting for
you to shoot, sweetie.</i>

22:36.897 --> 22:39.291
Could you please call me and
let me know what's going on?

22:44.692 --> 22:45.814
Okay,

22:45.839 --> 22:47.606
I left him some messages
too, some texts.

22:47.847 --> 22:49.079
Between me and
Megan, he'll call.

22:49.081 --> 22:50.435
- He always does.
- Right.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.631
This piece won't work or air

22:53.679 --> 22:55.166
without the sit-down.

22:59.666 --> 23:02.031
- This isn't normal.
- You don't just disappear.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.209
Kyle does.

23:03.210 --> 23:04.622
Sometimes he just needs
to clear his head.

23:04.623 --> 23:06.303
I'm sure that's what
he's doing right now.

23:06.694 --> 23:08.027
Please tell me I
just heard wrong

23:08.028 --> 23:09.093
and you know exactly
where Kyle is.

23:09.095 --> 23:10.495
Terence, I'm really sorry...

23:10.497 --> 23:11.729
How long has he been gone?

23:11.731 --> 23:12.931
He left hours ago.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.032
And what were you
doing hours ago?

23:14.034 --> 23:15.199
This isn't his fault.

23:15.201 --> 23:16.925
Looking after Kyle is his job.

23:17.044 --> 23:18.366
And I will find him.

23:24.225 --> 23:25.243
You okay?

23:25.531 --> 23:26.769
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:27.787 --> 23:29.204
Can I ask you a question?

23:29.922 --> 23:30.937
Sure.

23:31.203 --> 23:32.642
Why are you scared of him?

23:33.407 --> 23:34.617
Scared of who?

23:36.343 --> 23:37.343
Terence.

23:38.412 --> 23:40.158
I'm not scared of Terence.

23:40.448 --> 23:42.145
When that Isaac dude showed up,

23:42.583 --> 23:43.663
you froze.

23:44.685 --> 23:45.984
Everything's fine.

23:45.986 --> 23:47.586
It didn't seem fine.

23:47.588 --> 23:49.087
This place is supposed to
be good for you, right?

23:49.089 --> 23:50.222
So, what's up?

23:54.516 --> 23:55.570
Heyo.

23:55.996 --> 23:59.164
Hey, where have you been?
I've been calling.

23:59.166 --> 24:01.400
I, uh, needed some fresh
air so I took a ride.

24:01.402 --> 24:02.752
I'm sorry if you were
worried about me,

24:02.776 --> 24:03.802
but I am all good.

24:03.804 --> 24:06.441
Okay, well, Iris is
kinda freaking out.

24:06.469 --> 24:07.739
Okay, I'll smooth it over.

24:08.346 --> 24:09.913
Hey, do you mind
sticking around?

24:09.915 --> 24:11.214
I'd love to chat with you
after the interview.

24:11.216 --> 24:12.282
Yeah, sure.

24:12.620 --> 24:13.620
Great.

24:15.395 --> 24:17.504
Terence, do you got a second?

24:32.047 --> 24:33.533
I owe you an apology.

24:33.982 --> 24:35.742
Well, you came back.
That's all that matters.

24:36.009 --> 24:39.036
No, sometimes I forget
that you saved my life,

24:40.088 --> 24:42.228
or maybe I try to forget.

24:43.324 --> 24:45.288
I was at the right place
at the right time.

24:46.094 --> 24:48.454
You were also the one
person that could stop me,

24:49.067 --> 24:50.646
the one person that
I could trust.

24:54.618 --> 24:58.283
I need this... This
place, this work

24:58.932 --> 25:00.577
every day to remind me of that.

25:01.715 --> 25:02.943
So, thank you.

25:14.003 --> 25:15.118
I love you.

25:19.642 --> 25:22.439
Iris Holloway, I am sorry
to keep you waiting.

25:37.356 --> 25:39.306
I can't do it anymore.

25:41.469 --> 25:42.501
What happened?

25:42.526 --> 25:43.938
I tried to talk to him.

25:43.939 --> 25:45.386
He lost his shit.

25:46.047 --> 25:47.913
He's so angry.

25:50.579 --> 25:53.079
Terence, I can't do
it anymore, okay?

25:53.081 --> 25:54.203
I-I can't.

25:54.416 --> 25:56.416
I-I tried to let it go,
to be okay with it...

25:56.418 --> 25:58.218
With, with what he did,

25:58.220 --> 26:00.798
with everything that we
talked about in our sessions.

26:00.923 --> 26:03.023
But he crossed a line tonight,

26:03.025 --> 26:04.885
and I cannot undo that.

26:05.017 --> 26:07.320
Let's just stop trying
to pretend like I can.

26:07.419 --> 26:09.352
Okay, okay.

26:09.354 --> 26:10.440
Okay.

26:12.515 --> 26:13.956
I'm glad you came to me.

26:16.933 --> 26:19.507
You're the only person who
makes me feel safe anymore.

26:30.225 --> 26:31.908
Can I stay here
with you tonight?

26:40.504 --> 26:41.684
Wait.

26:42.915 --> 26:44.718
We are all alone here.

27:02.267 --> 27:04.180
So, off the record...

27:05.425 --> 27:07.112
Your disappearing act.

27:07.597 --> 27:08.978
What was that about?

27:09.465 --> 27:10.839
Off the record,

27:11.775 --> 27:13.384
the temper tantrum
of an entitled,

27:13.385 --> 27:15.013
self-obsessed movie star.

27:17.055 --> 27:18.488
Just kidding, I, uh,

27:18.490 --> 27:20.323
just needed a moment
to clear the clutter.

27:20.325 --> 27:21.740
I wanted to give you my best.

27:26.559 --> 27:27.933
Let's roll camera.

27:28.299 --> 27:29.801
Iris, go when you're ready.

27:32.944 --> 27:35.103
This is beautiful, peaceful.

27:35.655 --> 27:36.946
Not bad, huh?

27:36.947 --> 27:39.009
I can understand why
you like it here.

27:39.689 --> 27:41.409
<i>Love it, I love it here.</i>

27:41.917 --> 27:43.686
<i>Just feels like I belong.</i>

27:44.361 --> 27:45.953
<i>And every day I'm surrounded by</i>

27:46.162 --> 27:48.423
<i>a group of people
that care about me,</i>

27:48.792 --> 27:49.890
<i>support me.</i>

27:50.259 --> 27:52.059
<i>I wish we could stay
here forever...</i>

27:53.663 --> 27:56.291
This office floor,

27:58.197 --> 27:59.823
right here in this moment.

28:01.830 --> 28:02.869
Me too.

28:06.234 --> 28:07.713
So what happens next?

28:14.858 --> 28:15.968
I don't know.

28:17.646 --> 28:18.929
But I know one thing.

28:19.704 --> 28:20.899
What's that?

28:21.682 --> 28:23.003
I love you.

28:24.271 --> 28:25.722
I have for some time.

28:31.351 --> 28:32.925
I love hearing you say that.

28:36.691 --> 28:38.431
I wish it made it easier...

28:41.647 --> 28:42.812
But it doesn't.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.539
- It's very...
- Complicated.

28:47.446 --> 28:48.548
I know.

28:49.424 --> 28:51.414
Your wife, Kyle...

28:53.124 --> 28:54.674
I know that.

29:00.504 --> 29:01.849
Where are you going?

29:02.586 --> 29:04.282
I have to go check on him.

29:06.541 --> 29:07.903
He's in pain.

29:08.118 --> 29:09.384
He must be. I need to...

29:09.387 --> 29:11.142
Yeah, no, it's okay.

29:12.115 --> 29:13.216
I understand.

29:15.791 --> 29:16.971
I'll be here.

29:28.444 --> 29:29.605
Mmm.

29:37.184 --> 29:39.307
<i>Here, this'll help
bring you down.</i>

29:50.543 --> 29:51.908
Sorry I pointed a gun at you.

29:52.545 --> 29:54.274
Yeah, it happens.

29:55.915 --> 29:57.155
So, what's next?

29:59.392 --> 30:00.792
We need to go to the facility.

30:01.604 --> 30:03.110
Yeah, all right.

30:04.688 --> 30:05.814
For how long?

30:06.207 --> 30:08.207
As long as it takes for you
to love yourself again.

30:08.443 --> 30:10.177
We'll spin your absence
with the press.

30:13.203 --> 30:14.745
I wish it was easier.

30:15.779 --> 30:17.395
I just wish that I was stronger.

30:18.019 --> 30:20.082
Kyle, you're one of the
strongest people I know.

30:20.724 --> 30:21.875
You'll get through this.

30:23.427 --> 30:25.673
Look, nobody's narrative
is easy, man.

30:26.516 --> 30:28.132
We all make choices that...

30:30.319 --> 30:31.966
That complicate our path.

30:32.288 --> 30:33.305
But healing...

30:33.306 --> 30:35.342
Really healing isn't about
avoiding who you are.

30:35.393 --> 30:37.509
It's about confronting
who you are.

30:37.874 --> 30:39.787
And working through that,

30:40.237 --> 30:42.356
and ultimately
forgiving ourselves.

30:45.169 --> 30:46.360
You're a good man.

31:01.576 --> 31:02.903
I'll have it patched up.

31:03.778 --> 31:04.971
It's not up to me.

31:05.346 --> 31:06.657
That's his decision.

31:06.848 --> 31:08.191
You don't wanna stay here?

31:09.484 --> 31:11.078
I wanna start fresh.

31:11.836 --> 31:13.345
I want that for you too.

31:16.242 --> 31:17.852
We could get a place together...

31:18.844 --> 31:20.915
Little bungalow up in the hills,

31:21.611 --> 31:23.374
hide away from the world,

31:24.242 --> 31:25.467
see what we are,

31:26.044 --> 31:28.117
without all of this,

31:28.799 --> 31:30.151
without everyone else.

31:33.003 --> 31:34.288
That's not gonna happen.

31:34.691 --> 31:35.953
We're not gonna happen.

31:36.426 --> 31:37.901
Wait, Terence.

31:38.695 --> 31:40.428
- You said...
- I know what I said.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.163
You love me, you said that,

31:42.165 --> 31:44.532
and you feel it. I know
that you feel it...

31:44.534 --> 31:46.501
I have obligations,
people who rely on me.

31:46.503 --> 31:47.693
I have a wife.

31:48.138 --> 31:50.767
Please, DeAnn? You
don't love her.

31:50.792 --> 31:52.307
My marriage is not your concern.

31:52.309 --> 31:54.059
And this isn't about her.

31:55.713 --> 31:57.014
This is about him.

31:57.882 --> 32:01.717
Everything is always about him.

32:01.719 --> 32:02.795
He needs me.

32:05.650 --> 32:06.880
So do I.

32:07.877 --> 32:09.273
Please, so do I.

32:09.687 --> 32:10.719
Good-bye.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.535
I just have one more question.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.147
<i>Aww, that's it?</i>

32:29.380 --> 32:31.173
<i>We're just starting
to have a good time.</i>

32:33.274 --> 32:35.402
Who is Kyle West?

32:36.808 --> 32:38.908
I have been hanging out
with you all day, Iris.

32:38.909 --> 32:40.842
If you still don't know the
answer to that question,

32:40.844 --> 32:42.477
I think we have a problem.

32:42.479 --> 32:45.647
I'm not interested in
who I think you are.

32:45.978 --> 32:47.712
Who do you think you are?

32:50.454 --> 32:51.544
I'm, um,

32:53.123 --> 32:54.581
I'm a loyal friend.

32:56.289 --> 32:58.142
Loyal to the people that
really matter to me...

32:59.478 --> 33:01.070
My caring fiancée,

33:02.247 --> 33:03.560
someone who...

33:08.785 --> 33:09.886
Kyle?

33:16.503 --> 33:17.699
I'm a good man.

33:19.168 --> 33:20.271
Good person.

33:32.685 --> 33:33.744
<i>Sorry.</i>

33:36.969 --> 33:38.783
But I'm also flawed.

33:43.676 --> 33:45.170
<i>IHM has taught me</i>

33:45.803 --> 33:48.493
<i>how to be my best
self every day...</i>

33:49.998 --> 33:51.819
While I was confronting
who I was,

33:53.132 --> 33:55.355
who I am on my worst days,

33:56.402 --> 33:57.581
my flaws.

33:58.838 --> 34:00.463
<i>Nobody's narrative is easy.</i>

34:01.174 --> 34:04.498
<i>We all make choices that
complicate our path.</i>

34:04.877 --> 34:08.056
But healing is about
confronting who we are,

34:09.210 --> 34:10.614
working through it...

34:17.000 --> 34:18.810
And learning to
forgive ourselves.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.196
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:36.866 --> 34:38.630
Hey, man, let's chat.

34:38.655 --> 34:39.802
All right.

34:45.289 --> 34:47.242
Thanks for hanging
around and waiting.

34:47.292 --> 34:49.382
Yeah, sure, that was...

34:50.695 --> 34:52.527
You sure know how to
give an interview.

34:52.530 --> 34:54.396
Look, I have a bunch
of my own shit

34:54.398 --> 34:55.664
and I've been
throwing it on you.

34:55.666 --> 34:57.436
That's not right at all.

34:58.174 --> 34:59.735
And that's got to change.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.338
Good day for him.

35:03.087 --> 35:04.633
And for IHM.

35:05.615 --> 35:07.052
Two sides of the same coin.

35:07.378 --> 35:08.611
You know what?

35:08.863 --> 35:10.262
Great, I'm out.

35:18.485 --> 35:20.106
What the hell just happened?

35:20.722 --> 35:21.743
I fired him.

35:22.023 --> 35:23.119
What?

35:23.858 --> 35:25.113
And you were right.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.416
I'm an actor.

35:26.716 --> 35:28.180
I need to stop hiding from it.

35:29.819 --> 35:31.176
Xavier, wait.

35:31.587 --> 35:33.018
Xavier.

35:34.357 --> 35:36.546
Xavier, please don't leave.
We could fix this.

35:37.786 --> 35:39.165
The man just fired me.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.630
I know that's what he said...

35:40.631 --> 35:42.230
Oh, you think something
else is going on here?

35:42.231 --> 35:43.731
Kyle West and his
magical way of talking

35:43.733 --> 35:45.499
where nothing means what
it's supposed to mean.

35:45.501 --> 35:47.995
I just think if we calm down and
talk about this together...

35:48.020 --> 35:49.439
He's calm, Megan.

35:49.711 --> 35:51.617
He's the happiest I've
seen him in weeks.

35:53.087 --> 35:55.020
You're an amazing actor, Xavier,

35:55.022 --> 35:57.105
and I love working with you.

35:57.304 --> 35:58.637
We could figure this out.

35:58.639 --> 36:00.872
I don't want to. I tried.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.836
I tried joy, and I
tried compassion,

36:03.838 --> 36:05.538
and I even signed
up for this place

36:05.540 --> 36:06.754
to make the guy happy.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.101
You did?

36:08.509 --> 36:09.670
It's sad, right?

36:10.011 --> 36:11.811
Even then, I knew
nothing would change.

36:12.152 --> 36:14.185
No more trying. I need
to go make some music.

36:14.187 --> 36:16.078
Okay, don't try.
Just don't leave.

36:17.123 --> 36:19.024
I'll straighten
things out with Kyle.

36:19.259 --> 36:20.892
Let the rumors and
the press die down,

36:20.894 --> 36:22.896
and we'll just focus
on making the movie.

36:23.096 --> 36:24.580
It's a beautiful movie,

36:25.465 --> 36:27.164
and we're making it together.

36:27.701 --> 36:28.868
We were.

36:31.828 --> 36:33.183
I love working with you.

36:34.030 --> 36:35.930
I watch you dive
deep every day...

36:36.566 --> 36:39.653
No fear, looking for
the most painful,

36:40.184 --> 36:42.328
honest shit so you could
turn it into art.

36:45.905 --> 36:47.763
That's why this
movie's beautiful...

36:47.765 --> 36:49.224
Because of you.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.668
Now, I have no
business saying this,

36:52.670 --> 36:54.670
and I don't know what situation
you got yourself into

36:54.672 --> 36:56.196
but whoever these people are,

36:56.407 --> 36:57.800
whatever they mean to you,

37:00.860 --> 37:02.481
you're way too good for them.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.252
I had the narrative all wrong.

37:26.432 --> 37:28.899
I mean, after Lisbeth
left, I used acting

37:28.901 --> 37:30.801
to bury everything
that I was ashamed of,

37:31.066 --> 37:33.112
so I became ashamed
of acting itself.

37:33.546 --> 37:35.046
To be honest, that's the reason

37:35.048 --> 37:37.090
I took myself out of the
movie in the first place.

37:37.888 --> 37:39.888
I... it's basic principles.

37:40.369 --> 37:41.457
Do the work.

37:41.459 --> 37:42.958
Don't let the past
corrupt the present.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.960
I mean, you've been
saying it all along.

37:45.202 --> 37:46.803
Acting is a gift.

37:47.037 --> 37:48.937
I need to use it
to inspire people.

37:48.939 --> 37:50.572
Well, that's... That's
beautiful, Kyle.

37:50.574 --> 37:51.974
But you know what the narrative

37:51.976 --> 37:53.300
for the rest of the
world's gonna be, right?

37:53.324 --> 37:54.476
The jealous fiancé.

37:54.852 --> 37:56.051
It's not about that.

37:56.053 --> 37:57.292
It's not about the
rumors at all.

37:57.293 --> 37:59.156
Closet racist with a
flop on his hands...

37:59.181 --> 38:00.413
Fires the black guy.

38:00.415 --> 38:02.081
Racist? Oh, come on.

38:02.083 --> 38:03.615
I'm just telling you how
it's gonna go, man.

38:03.639 --> 38:04.818
It's not very inspiring.

38:04.871 --> 38:06.148
It'll blow over.

38:06.173 --> 38:08.555
Big picture, I thought you'd be
a little happier about this.

38:08.557 --> 38:11.624
It won't just blow over.
It never just blows over.

38:11.626 --> 38:13.560
And yes, we will change
the goddamn narrative,

38:13.562 --> 38:14.961
but you know what? It's work.

38:15.340 --> 38:17.340
It's work, and guess
what, it's a shit job.

38:17.342 --> 38:18.841
And I get tired of it.

38:19.010 --> 38:20.431
And not to mention DeAnn.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.312
Not to mention DeAnn,
who's got to figure out

38:22.314 --> 38:24.981
how to throw away an
entire month's work.

38:25.147 --> 38:27.193
Enjoy that phone call,
'cause I'm not making it.

38:27.645 --> 38:30.114
Fine, I'll call DeAnn.
I'll explain everything.

38:34.439 --> 38:35.657
Look, man, I'm...

38:37.153 --> 38:38.319
I'm sorry for any time that

38:38.321 --> 38:39.721
I've made your life
more difficult.

38:40.690 --> 38:41.955
But before you know it,

38:41.957 --> 38:43.506
everything is gonna
be right again.

38:44.205 --> 38:45.752
Look, man, you are
gonna be happy

38:45.753 --> 38:47.451
that I did this, I promise.

38:51.764 --> 38:53.042
Xavier okay?

38:54.494 --> 38:55.698
He's working on it.

38:56.602 --> 38:59.003
I know he doesn't get it,
but this isn't personal.

38:59.575 --> 39:01.972
Can we just go home? We'll
talk about this later.

39:02.270 --> 39:05.029
Sure, I just wanna say
thank you to Iris first.

39:14.627 --> 39:15.707
You happy?

39:16.246 --> 39:17.795
- No, I'm not.
- Really?

39:18.115 --> 39:20.415
Kyle's the star again. That's
what you always wanted.

39:20.417 --> 39:22.015
Listen, I don't know
what the hell you think,

39:22.016 --> 39:24.052
but Kyle made this
decision on his own.

39:24.287 --> 39:27.021
He has your voice in
his head, Terence,

39:27.023 --> 39:29.039
and you have told him over

39:29.064 --> 39:31.311
and over not to rely on me.

39:31.882 --> 39:35.184
And now here we are at goddamn
square one of this movie

39:35.186 --> 39:37.584
that means so much to us,

39:38.055 --> 39:40.306
to him, and that's on you.

39:41.158 --> 39:43.054
Yeah, every story
needs a bad actor.

39:43.594 --> 39:45.164
What is that supposed to mean?

39:45.696 --> 39:48.097
Someone whose sole purpose
is to screw you over,

39:48.099 --> 39:49.632
so when things
don't go your way,

39:49.634 --> 39:51.266
you have someone to blame...

39:51.601 --> 39:52.945
Better me than Kyle,

39:53.177 --> 39:55.672
better than thinking he doesn't
trust you with this movie.

39:56.634 --> 40:00.436
You have been trying to push
me aside since the beginning.

40:00.438 --> 40:02.171
No, that's your reality.

40:02.515 --> 40:04.941
In my reality, the world
doesn't revolve around you,

40:05.569 --> 40:07.196
and you're not that important.

40:09.604 --> 40:11.938
- Hey, I was just speaking...
- I'm done for the day.

40:25.364 --> 40:27.364
Okay. Look, let me
know what they say.

40:27.548 --> 40:28.820
We always have other options.

40:29.183 --> 40:30.749
You think jealousy had
something to do with it?

40:30.751 --> 40:32.559
There's nothing
to be jealous of.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.126
Well, maybe the
rumors got to him.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.408
I mean, it's not like you and
Xavier don't have chemistry.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.202
Look,

40:38.512 --> 40:39.989
Kyle was miserable.

40:40.184 --> 40:42.618
He disappeared and he came back
a completely different person.

40:42.620 --> 40:45.521
I don't know what happened,
but Terence did something.

40:45.787 --> 40:48.321
And there's no way that
Julie Wolfe doesn't exist.

40:48.323 --> 40:50.656
Terence definitely had
those records wiped.

40:50.658 --> 40:52.237
Well, that's one possibility.

40:52.794 --> 40:54.280
What else would it be?

40:57.765 --> 40:59.627
Shaun's lying about
what she found.

41:06.143 --> 41:08.918
So, I told DeAnn
what's going on.

41:09.523 --> 41:11.709
- How'd that go?
- She's furious.

41:11.925 --> 41:13.792
Reshooting all of Xavier's
scenes is gonna cost us

41:13.794 --> 41:15.414
a ton of money that
we don't have,

41:15.491 --> 41:17.578
and in the press' eyes,
I am now seen as

41:17.603 --> 41:20.374
"a fragile egomaniac making
a flaming tower of shit."

41:20.931 --> 41:21.972
Her words.

41:22.163 --> 41:23.429
But we're gonna make the movie

41:23.431 --> 41:24.897
that we all originally imagined,

41:24.899 --> 41:26.270
and she couldn't deny that.

41:27.955 --> 41:31.036
And now, I need to
know how you're doing.

41:34.470 --> 41:36.962
I'm just trying to make
sense of this whole thing,

41:38.327 --> 41:39.401
I know...

41:41.187 --> 41:43.221
I told you if we were gonna
make the movie we wanted,

41:43.223 --> 41:44.494
I couldn't be in it,

41:44.495 --> 41:46.412
and now I'm telling
you the opposite.

41:49.811 --> 41:52.014
Did you lose trust in
me for some reason?

41:52.881 --> 41:54.282
No, never.

41:55.083 --> 41:57.416
And this had nothing to do
with you and Xavier, either.

41:58.442 --> 42:01.073
This whole thing happened
because I lost trust in myself

42:01.860 --> 42:03.129
and the principles
that got me here.

42:03.130 --> 42:04.434
What principles?

42:04.435 --> 42:05.934
The principles I learned at IHM.

42:06.167 --> 42:08.015
No, what got you here

42:08.040 --> 42:10.184
was talent and hard work.

42:10.209 --> 42:11.471
It was you.

42:11.578 --> 42:15.380
The person I connected with in
that first audition was you.

42:16.135 --> 42:19.336
In two minutes, I could
see everything about you

42:19.338 --> 42:23.040
that was beautiful and
flawed and vulnerable,

42:23.042 --> 42:24.057
and that...

42:24.519 --> 42:26.470
That is who I fell in love with,

42:27.256 --> 42:29.124
not whatever Terence
put in your head.

42:29.959 --> 42:31.358
Whatever Terence put in my head

42:31.360 --> 42:33.051
is the only reason
that I'm here today.

42:33.599 --> 42:37.127
I've been to the darkest places,

42:37.650 --> 42:39.792
and IHM is the only thing
that pulled me back.

42:40.056 --> 42:42.305
It is my lifeline, and
when I forget that...

42:42.307 --> 42:44.372
Let me be your lifeline.

42:45.777 --> 42:47.143
I love you.

42:47.485 --> 42:48.802
That's not how it works.

42:49.081 --> 42:50.841
You can't save me from myself.

42:51.183 --> 42:52.516
But Terence can?

42:52.851 --> 42:54.598
No, I have to do it.

42:55.224 --> 42:58.226
But I have used the tools
that he gave me every day.

42:59.414 --> 43:01.127
It's the only thing that works.

43:02.555 --> 43:03.754
And I love you too.
