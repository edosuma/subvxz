01:52.267 --> 01:55.034
( Buzzing )

01:55.101 --> 01:58.500
Frankie,
where are you?

02:43.867 --> 02:46.067
Welcome to the chop shop,
<I>cugine.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.468
You can't kill
me twice, sally boy.

02:57.533 --> 03:00.468
I'M already fucking
dead, remember?

03:00.533 --> 03:04.001
I'M the boss, michael.
What you had belongs
to me.

03:04.067 --> 03:05.900
Even the girl I loved?

03:05.967 --> 03:08.533
What's mine is mine.
What's yours is mine.

03:12.034 --> 03:14.800
( Grunts )

03:14.906 --> 03:16.760
Well...

03:16.831 --> 03:19.308
This is mine too,
sally.

03:22.304 --> 03:24.661
Now you can have it.

03:24.739 --> 03:27.100
- <I>Vaffancul'.
- ( screams )

03:42.439 --> 03:44.362
Fuck ben kingsley.

03:44.436 --> 03:47.163
Danny bawildtook him
to fucking acting school.

03:47.236 --> 03:49.163
Very well directed,
morgan.

03:49.237 --> 03:52.833
I Think there's potentially
more money in this than in
the porn we've done.

03:52.905 --> 03:55.233
So what do we think?
We need the extra scene
or not?

03:55.308 --> 03:56.832
I Like it
the way it is.

03:56.906 --> 04:00.402
I Don't know, rissy,
these audiences today
love blood.

04:00.468 --> 04:02.160
I Tend to agree
with carlo.

04:02.235 --> 04:04.231
I'M thinking
one more sexy kill.

04:04.307 --> 04:06.802
When michael follows
centrella to the strip
club,

04:06.865 --> 04:09.163
What if he chops up one
of the women?

04:09.237 --> 04:11.163
Carmine: who as fate
would have it,

04:11.236 --> 04:13.502
Was at one time
sally boy's mistress.

04:13.608 --> 04:15.532
Two extra shoot days,
at a minimum.

04:15.606 --> 04:17.732
- Kid, if it buys us a bullshit
theatrical release--
- <I>( cell phone buzzing )

04:17.805 --> 04:20.361
I'M gonna have to get
more money from tony.

04:20.435 --> 04:23.031
I Want this fucking thing
out there.

04:23.108 --> 04:24.503
Yeah, t, what's up?

04:24.568 --> 04:26.200
You talked to the guy
with the air mattresses?

04:26.268 --> 04:28.731
I'M in editing.
We just saw the cut
of "cleaver."

04:28.838 --> 04:30.903
- And?
- <I>Awesome as is.

04:30.968 --> 04:33.633
The lawyer called, though.
We might have to change
the title.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.161
The eldridge cleaver estate,
ey wtht an injunction.

04:36.238 --> 04:39.831
<I>Listen, if you wan see
<I>some of it, we're finishing
<I>the adr after lunch.

04:39.907 --> 04:42.163
- What's that again?
- Sound dubbing.

04:42.236 --> 04:44.632
Just call this dispatcher.
It's a holiday weekend.

04:44.706 --> 04:46.730
Thousands of people will
be out at the beach.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.300
I'M on it.

04:48.366 --> 04:50.100
- He coming down?
- Please.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.603
He don't give two shits
abt production.

04:52.665 --> 04:54.162
It's a little boring,
I gotta say.

04:54.237 --> 04:56.232
I Mean, that was
surising to me.

05:03.607 --> 05:06.302
Mr. Sacrimoni,
how are you today?

05:06.368 --> 05:08.332
Isn't that for you
to tell me?

05:11.836 --> 05:13.760
I Wish I had
better news.

05:13.836 --> 05:15.462
Bad on
the latest pictures,

05:15.538 --> 05:18.360
The cancer has continued
to metastasize
from the lungs.

05:18.435 --> 05:20.530
We now show masses
in the mediastinal
lymph nodes,

05:20.605 --> 05:22.332
Both kidneys
and the brain.

05:22.407 --> 05:24.763
The headaches.

05:29.568 --> 05:32.333
So the...

05:32.407 --> 05:35.203
Lobectomy, radiation,

05:35.265 --> 05:36.933
<I>The goddamn chemo,

05:37.007 --> 05:39.733
What was all that?
( Coughs )  for kicks?

05:39.807 --> 05:42.261
Those were our options
at the time.

05:42.336 --> 05:44.332
And now what are
r options?

05:44.407 --> 05:46.160
Limited to the extent
that I wouldn't
recommend any.

05:46.236 --> 05:49.402
At this point, we're looking
at stage four small cell
carcinoma of the lungs.

05:49.465 --> 05:51.902
- And there's no stage five.
- That's correct.

05:56.967 --> 05:58.902
How long?

05:58.968 --> 06:01.862
Difficult to say.

06:01.937 --> 06:04.901
- I Have seen miracles
over the years.
- Forget the miracles.

06:04.966 --> 06:06.963
Three months.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.960
Give or take.

06:22.407 --> 06:24.363
Thank you
for your candor.

06:24.437 --> 06:26.461
We have a plane
back to ringspeld.

06:28.365 --> 06:31.462
How you doing, john?

06:31.537 --> 06:35.132
It's funny--
ironic-- whichever.

06:36.167 --> 06:37.633
I Got here.

06:37.707 --> 06:40.631
I Quit smoking
after 38 years,

06:40.667 --> 06:43.863
Exercised, ate right.

06:46.005 --> 06:49.061
And for what?

06:49.136 --> 06:51.133
Even still,

06:51.207 --> 06:53.502
It was the right move.

07:08.308 --> 07:11.230
<I>( Man on television
<I>speaks indistinctly )

07:13.205 --> 07:16.061
<I>( Men shouting )

07:18.637 --> 07:20.503
Oh, there she is,
my girl.

07:20.568 --> 07:22.863
How are you, sweetie?

07:22.936 --> 07:24.760
- Hey, dad.
- Hi.

07:30.438 --> 07:32.202
What did rosen say?

07:34.906 --> 07:38.231
- How's the hotel?
You all settled in?
- It's fine.

07:40.367 --> 07:42.602
- How are you, angel?
You look beautiful.
- I'M good.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.701
- Allegra: <I>eric sends
<I> his love.
- <I>that's nice.

07:44.766 --> 07:46.963
John,
what about rosen?

07:52.006 --> 07:54.963
I Don't know. I...

07:55.038 --> 07:57.300
I Don't know, sweetie.

07:59.208 --> 08:02.203
- I'M very very sick.
- Oh my god.

08:02.265 --> 08:04.963
( Crying )

08:06.835 --> 08:08.961
All right, don't cry.

08:09.036 --> 08:12.432
Don't cry. You don't
have to make it any harder
than it is, all right?

08:12.506 --> 08:15.002
No physical contact,
please.

08:16.635 --> 08:19.363
- I Love you, john.
- I Love you, too.

08:19.436 --> 08:22.602
- Daddy.
- I Know.  I Know.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.732
Ladies, no contact.

08:28.165 --> 08:30.062
All right.

08:31.668 --> 08:34.433
You come back,
you see me again tomorrow.

08:34.508 --> 08:36.801
We have more time,
huh?

09:14.666 --> 09:17.303
Could I bum one
of those?

09:30.907 --> 09:32.761
It's casual,
though, right?

09:32.835 --> 09:35.663
It's your cousin's movie
premiere.  We should
dress accordingly.

09:35.735 --> 09:37.733
It's what they call
a cast-and-crew screening.

09:37.807 --> 09:39.763
It's in the city, tony,

09:39.838 --> 09:41.930
With an after-party
at some rooftop bar

09:42.008 --> 09:44.630
In the meat-packing
district.  That place
is very chic now.

09:44.708 --> 09:48.031
Meat packers?
I'M a happily married man.

09:48.106 --> 09:50.031
Meadow: <I>I'm telling you
<I>it's not dress up.

09:50.107 --> 09:52.163
Carmela:
<I>speaking of dress up,
<I>christopher told me

09:52.237 --> 09:55.002
Kelli is having her wedding
dress made into an outfit

09:55.066 --> 09:57.861
- For the baby
to be christened in.
- Oh, sweet.

09:57.938 --> 09:59.903
( Burps )

10:03.407 --> 10:06.001
You all right?

10:12.005 --> 10:13.930
Are you taking a date
to the screening?

10:14.006 --> 10:15.863
If I can meet
a normal guy, maybe.

10:15.935 --> 10:17.860
I Heard that

10:19.605 --> 10:21.531
What, finn wasn't normal?

10:21.605 --> 10:24.000
I Don't intend
to discuss finn.

10:24.068 --> 10:26.631
What about that guy
in your mcat review?

10:26.808 --> 10:29.861
Please, he's completely
fixated  his o-chem final.

10:29.936 --> 10:32.602
He wants to be a doctor.
Tell him it's educational.

10:32.668 --> 10:34.632
There's body parts
all over this movie.

10:34.705 --> 10:37.401
Hey, screw the movie.
I Just wanna hang
with celebs.

10:37.466 --> 10:40.401
Why, you think you're
gonna get to sleep
with paris hilton?

10:40.466 --> 10:42.363
What? No.

10:43.907 --> 10:47.502
Stop fidgeting
and eat your noodles.

10:47.568 --> 10:49.502
- I Don't want them.
- Where are you going?

10:49.568 --> 10:51.700
The bathroom.
Jesus.

10:54.165 --> 10:56.701
- Meow.
- You two have a fight?

10:56.805 --> 10:58.832
I Don't know.

11:00.665 --> 11:04.300
Keep an eye on his temp, and
we'll finish out the week
on the ceftin.

11:04.365 --> 11:05.800
<I>You rest now.
<I>I'll see you
<I>in the morning.

11:05.867 --> 11:09.800
- He should be on heparin.
- Excuse me.

11:09.868 --> 11:12.730
Listen to him.
Check his abg.

11:12.808 --> 11:16.000
I'M gonna have to ask you
again to not interfere,
warren.

11:22.866 --> 11:24.603
I'M gonna
change your sheets.

11:26.007 --> 11:28.260
So what are you,
the world's smartest orderly?

11:28.338 --> 11:30.263
These days I am.

11:30.336 --> 11:32.930
22 Years a
practicing oncologist,

11:33.036 --> 11:35.563
Specializing
in cancers of the liver.

11:35.637 --> 11:37.563
<I>Roll to your right,
<I>please.

11:40.708 --> 11:43.660
Let me spare us
the awkwardness.

11:43.731 --> 11:45.768
I Killed my wife.

11:45.834 --> 11:48.331
Not that it's
any justification,

11:48.409 --> 11:50.430
I Had reason
to suspect

11:50.509 --> 11:54.100
She was cheating on me
with her chiropractor.

11:54.166 --> 11:57.803
- Jesus.
- <I>Granted, I was abusing
<I> cocaine at the time,

11:57.805 --> 12:01.432
And alcohol. But
I came home one y,da

12:01.508 --> 12:04.800
Shot her four times--
twice in the head.

12:04.866 --> 12:07.430
I Killed her aunt, too.

12:09.665 --> 12:13.430
I Didn't know
she was there.
Roll over, please.

12:14.635 --> 12:16.530
And the mailman.

12:16.607 --> 12:18.600
At that point
I had to fully commit.

12:20.138 --> 12:21.631
Why are you here
exactly?

12:21.705 --> 12:23.662
I'Ve been accused
of being part

12:23.736 --> 12:26.663
Of a certain
italian-american subculture.

12:26.767 --> 12:29.432
( Laughs )
hey, I know who you are.

12:29.508 --> 12:31.433
I Meant,
what's wrong with you?

12:31.437 --> 12:33.463
Oh.

12:33.538 --> 12:36.962
- Lungs.
- I'Ve been wanting
to meet you, actually.

12:37.038 --> 12:39.400
I Saw you on bill curtis.

12:39.465 --> 12:42.503
- Warren feldman.
- John sacrimoni.

12:42.567 --> 12:45.063
Good to know you.

12:45.136 --> 12:48.101
- I Take it you
done chemo, huh?
- Twice.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.932
Mind if I take a look
at your chart?

12:50.008 --> 12:52.232
What about gunga din?

12:52.335 --> 12:55.163
Gupte? Fuck him.

12:55.237 --> 12:57.201
Oh, you're seeing rosen.

12:57.265 --> 13:00.431
They let me fly
to cleveland, my expense.

13:00.506 --> 13:02.300
- You know him?
- I Saw him speak once

13:02.366 --> 13:06.102
At an asco conference
in georgia.

13:06.168 --> 13:08.530
- Good man.
- But...

13:08.608 --> 13:11.261
Actually, very few
people know this,

13:11.336 --> 13:13.701
But he really can't walk
on water.

13:15.136 --> 13:17.432
What was his prognosis?

13:17.508 --> 13:19.330
Three months.

13:19.406 --> 13:22.363
- With the treatment
yove had?
- What do you mean?

13:23.566 --> 13:26.630
You got a window
of one to three years.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.733
What
about the metastases?

13:28.806 --> 13:30.960
Two rounds of paraplatin,

13:31.037 --> 13:32.730
Docetaxel and platinol

13:32.838 --> 13:34.430
Concurrent with radiation?

13:34.507 --> 13:37.000
Come on, any cancer
inside you has slowed
to a crawl.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.102
Why is he so
fucking negative?

13:41.165 --> 13:45.063
We tell the patient three
months.  He lives a year.
Who looks like a hero?

13:48.436 --> 13:52.060
I'Ll see you around, john.
You take it easy.
Hang in there.

14:02.135 --> 14:04.060
Fuck me.

14:06.865 --> 14:09.102
Tony, morning.

14:10.306 --> 14:12.232
You got a sec?

14:16.668 --> 14:18.401
As I told you,
my partner and I a

14:18.468 --> 14:20.800
With the joint terror
task force now.

14:23.206 --> 14:25.302
You're around port newark
often enough.

14:25.368 --> 14:27.601
We're concerned about
what might come through
there from the middle east.

14:27.665 --> 14:30.162
Yeah, and...

14:30.268 --> 14:32.432
Let's talk terror funding.

14:32.507 --> 14:35.131
<I>Most of it comes about
<I>through illegal enterprise.

14:35.205 --> 14:38.101
Our pitch is this,
and it's the same we gave
christopher moltisanti--

14:38.167 --> 14:39.863
<I>E he never
<I>mentioned it:

14:39.936 --> 14:43.100
If you or any
of your people ever heard
of anything going down,

14:43.167 --> 14:44.902
Middle easterners,
pakistanis,

14:44.965 --> 14:48.130
You'd be helping us a lot
if you let us know.

14:50.005 --> 14:51.963
I Think there's
a word for that.

14:52.038 --> 14:55.000
Your daughter takes
pre-med classes
in new york.

14:55.067 --> 14:56.661
She use the tunnels?

15:05.208 --> 15:07.200
Just something
to keep in mind.

15:12.708 --> 15:15.202
That's the last time
I'm going down
for the paper.

15:15.308 --> 15:17.660
You tell that
fucking polack
to get here earlier

15:17.737 --> 15:19.700
And bring up the paper
with her

15:19.765 --> 15:22.230
Or she can go clean
somebody else's
fucking toilets.

15:22.307 --> 15:24.332
What happened?

15:24.406 --> 15:27.001
It's too dangerous.
Has been for years.

15:33.405 --> 15:36.632
May I have
your attentionpl, se?

15:39.267 --> 15:41.733
Welcome to the premiere
of "cleaver,"

15:41.808 --> 15:44.603
The story of a young man
who goes to pieces

15:44.666 --> 15:46.431
Then manages
to find himselagf n.

15:46.505 --> 15:48.760
( Scattered laughter )

15:48.837 --> 15:50.701
<I>In all seriousness,
<I>however,

15:50.765 --> 15:53.161
I'D like
to say a few words.

15:53.237 --> 15:56.631
Much like a child,
a film has many parents,

15:56.707 --> 15:59.430
<I>That is to say
<I>many individuals

15:59.506 --> 16:01.500
Who act like parents,

16:01.568 --> 16:03.763
Or that by aversion,

16:03.836 --> 16:06.600
The film is their baby.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.701
I, As an executive
producer,

16:08.766 --> 16:10.533
Am one
of those individuals.

16:10.605 --> 16:13.201
Two more examples
are here with me tonight.

16:13.267 --> 16:16.831
Ladies and gentlemen,
my co-e.p. Christopher
moltisanti

16:16.905 --> 16:19.203
And our director
morgan yam.

16:23.465 --> 16:25.401
Yeah, hey!

16:27.666 --> 16:29.663
I Know you're all psyched
to see the movie,

16:29.738 --> 16:31.703
So I'm not gonna give
a big speech here.

16:31.765 --> 16:33.733
I Just wanna give a
shout out

16:33.805 --> 16:35.933
To the man who
without him

16:36.005 --> 16:38.961
This whole thing
would be impossible.
Where is he?

16:39.038 --> 16:42.032
Thony soprano,

16:42.107 --> 16:44.260
- Man: <I>hey!

16:44.335 --> 16:47.661
Christopher: <I>once he came
<I>on board, the whole thing
<I>fell together.

16:47.737 --> 16:51.332
And all the other
investors, too.

16:51.407 --> 16:54.632
Plus my wife kelli

I Love you guys.

16:55.908 --> 16:58.530

17:09.835 --> 17:11.933
( Eerie music playing )

17:27.637 --> 17:30.102
You don't know what?
He's a fucking rat!

17:30.305 --> 17:32.930
- But we can't really prove it.
- You're gonna argue with me?

17:32.968 --> 17:36.402
Frankie: <I>no, it's just,
<I>I mean, he's practically
<I>like your own son.

17:36.465 --> 17:38.601
I'M sorry, sally.
I Think we oughta
give him a pass.

17:38.665 --> 17:40.463
I Didn't ask you
what you fucking think.

17:41.868 --> 17:44.502
Motherfucking

17:47.166 --> 17:49.701

17:52.936 --> 17:55.831

17:59.035 --> 18:02.731
( Cell phonegs )

18:02.808 --> 18:05.500

18:08.907 --> 18:10.701

18:12.438 --> 18:15.030
Paulie:

18:15.108 --> 18:18.062
I Hate to say this,

18:18.135 --> 18:20.001
<I>I Mean,
<I>he's a good kid.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.501

18:24.306 --> 18:26.732
Paulie:

18:26.805 --> 18:28.701
Woman: <I>shh!

18:34.936 --> 18:37.603
You know how long
I've been waiting
to do that?

18:46.668 --> 18:50.003
<I>( Dominique moaning )

18:56.338 --> 19:00.200
Dad, that was neat
at the end, the creepy
figurine and the crucifix.

19:00.267 --> 19:03.001
I'M glad you caught that,
alexandra.  Very observant.

19:03.065 --> 19:04.901
The sacred
and the <I>propane.

19:04.967 --> 19:07.933
There's a ton of people
wearing t-shirts here.
I Told you.

19:08.006 --> 19:11.601
Is it so horrible
you look nice?

19:11.668 --> 19:15.101
I'M starving.
I Need to eat
something already.

19:15.168 --> 19:17.202
I Asked if you
wanted popcorn.

19:18.738 --> 19:22.003
- You want me
to make you a plate?
- Yeah.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.362
- What?
- What?  I'Ll give
you what.

19:31.438 --> 19:34.800
Come here.
The fucking boss
down in the cellar,

19:34.866 --> 19:37.501
White bathrobe--
where'd you get that?

19:37.568 --> 19:40.131
I Don't know.
Artistic choice.

19:40.205 --> 19:43.403
Seriously though,
I'm very proud.

19:43.468 --> 19:45.861
Whatever else happens,
you made a movie,christopher.

19:45.937 --> 19:47.961
Nobody could
take that away.

19:48.036 --> 19:50.260
A hundred years from now,
we're de and gone,

19:50.337 --> 19:52.302
People will be watching
this fucking thing.

19:52.366 --> 19:54.301
You know how much
imperia vodka
I scored just

19:54.365 --> 19:56.260
From this
party alone?

19:56.366 --> 19:58.902
I Had a couple of cases
put down in your car, too.

20:04.235 --> 20:07.461
Look at this--
the family of early man.

20:13.305 --> 20:14.803
Great, thank you.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.563
Carmine: <I>hey, danny,
<I>come here.

20:17.638 --> 20:20.431
Take a picture
with us.  Phil leotardo.

20:20.507 --> 20:23.702
Larry and I hung out
at the set.  I Don't
know if you know this,

20:23.768 --> 20:26.332
But the actors,
they don't make up
what they say.

20:26.407 --> 20:29.203
- It's true. Even de niro,
the girl told me.
- The script girl.

20:29.265 --> 20:31.503
- Lorenzo barese.
- Hey, how you doing,
my friend?

20:31.567 --> 20:33.501
You getting enough
to eat?

20:33.565 --> 20:35.533
Bryan rawley,
u.s. Marshal's service.

20:35.637 --> 20:37.331
Terms of your bail confine
you to yr oume, sir.

20:37.408 --> 20:40.202
- Say hello to danny?
- Yeah.

20:40.267 --> 20:42.862
- Larry's wife: <I>larry!

20:42.937 --> 20:44.703
- <I>Larry!
- rawley: <I>excuse us,
<I> excuse us.

20:44.766 --> 20:47.702
- Excuse us, excuse us.
- <I>Leave him alone,
<I> you bastard!

20:49.635 --> 20:51.601
Jesus christ.

20:53.668 --> 20:56.662
There's danny's manager.
I Better go talk to him.

21:00.707 --> 21:02.631
There he is.

21:05.338 --> 21:07.662
So how was florida?

21:07.736 --> 21:09.803
Hot and sticky,
like my balls.

21:11.107 --> 21:13.462
I Okspto ginny.
She's a wreck.

21:13.537 --> 21:15.461
John's
in the cancer ward.

21:15.537 --> 21:17.460
She's down the road
in some fucking motel.

21:17.538 --> 21:19.462
Poor prick.

21:19.535 --> 21:21.463
Prison's not bad enough,
fucking lung cancer to boot.

21:21.535 --> 21:24.432
Tell me about it--
quintuple bypass,

21:24.506 --> 21:26.360
Then the infection,

21:26.467 --> 21:28.431
Seven months
of physical thery.

21:28.505 --> 21:31.363
I'M just now starting
to get back to myself
again.

21:31.438 --> 21:33.503
Sausage, cioppino,
anything spicy

21:33.567 --> 21:35.961
Put me back
in the emergency room,
I'm not careful.

21:36.038 --> 21:37.832
( Sighs )

21:37.905 --> 21:40.632
All in all,
we're lucky fucks.

21:40.705 --> 21:42.563
I Tell myself that
every day.

21:46.568 --> 21:48.760
So now you're back.
How about you straighten
that family out?

21:48.838 --> 21:50.833
Not for me, anthony.

21:50.908 --> 21:54.430
Obviously, healthwise,
being a boss is a young
man's game.

21:54.508 --> 21:56.533
Between the joint fitters
and the carpenters,

21:56.605 --> 21:59.763
Those envelopes are light
er 10% each week.

21:59.908 --> 22:02.301
I Feel it, too.

22:03.866 --> 22:06.930
Well, word on the street
is gerry's the favorite
to take over.

22:07.006 --> 22:10.360
He's my protege.
I Don't stand
in his way.

22:10.436 --> 22:12.263
There's a ringing
endorsement.

22:12.335 --> 22:14.860
- Hey, tony.
- Doc, doc.

22:14.935 --> 22:16.930
- You know danny, huh?
- How you doing, mr. Soprano?

22:17.006 --> 22:18.732
Doc: <I>got a ticket
<I>on the jersey turnpike.

22:18.808 --> 22:21.131
Broken windshield wiper.
I Said he should talk
to you.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.632
- I'Ll take care of it.
- That's not necessary.

22:23.705 --> 22:26.732
- Let's take a picture here.
- All right, chill out, doc.

22:30.606 --> 22:32.833
Man:
<I>if you're phil leotardo
<I>you cannot be happy

22:32.906 --> 22:35.431
With the state of affairs,
despite appearances.

22:35.508 --> 22:38.730
We're joined now via satellite
from bainbridge island,
washington,

22:38.807 --> 22:41.063
By jerry's fellow
mob expert manny safier,

22:41.135 --> 22:44.533
The author of the
new book "the wise guide
to wiseguys."

22:44.608 --> 22:47.002
Manny, welcome to the program.
How goes the book tour?

22:47.068 --> 22:49.462
Thank you, geraldo.
Excellent.

22:49.536 --> 22:52.102
- Jerry, how are you?
- Manny.

22:52.167 --> 22:55.830
So we're discussing the
apparent mob power vacuum
here in new york city.

22:55.907 --> 22:59.361
Are you shocked that
there's still no successor
to john sacrimoni?

22:59.437 --> 23:00.433
Not really.

23:00.507 --> 23:02.760
I Mean, the last 10,
12 years,

23:02.837 --> 23:04.560
That's been
a dysfunctional family.

23:04.638 --> 23:08.103
And as jerry said earlier,
there are several viable
candidates.

23:08.166 --> 23:09.403
Well, viable,
I don't know.

23:09.465 --> 23:12.802
You had phil leotardo
as the logical successor.

23:12.867 --> 23:15.331
You also have gerardo
"gerry" torciano,

23:15.407 --> 23:20.161
<I>Also faustino "doc"
<I>santoro, who I believe
<I>is the frontrunner.

23:20.235 --> 23:23.502
I'M surprised you
haven't mentioned
carmine lupertazzi, jr.

23:23.606 --> 23:25.862
I Was about to, manny,
before you interrued.

23:25.936 --> 23:28.763
Manny:
<I>in fact, if you take a look
<I>at my book in chapter 14...

23:28.835 --> 23:32.431
This santoro thing,
I called it a year ago.

23:33.905 --> 23:36.103
Hey.

23:37.566 --> 23:39.832
Thank you for coming,
anthony.

23:40.905 --> 23:42.663
I Know it's a long trip.

23:42.737 --> 23:44.660
What, and miss a chance
to see missouri?

23:57.008 --> 23:58.831
So how's jenny today?

23:58.905 --> 24:01.002
She went with allegra
to buy some stuff
for the kitchenette.

24:01.068 --> 24:03.960
Oh, good,
clear her mind.

24:04.037 --> 24:05.860
Reason I asked
you here today,

24:05.936 --> 24:08.463
She's a bright kid,
your sister.

24:08.538 --> 24:11.662
But nebusi...

24:11.767 --> 24:13.701
My life insurance,

24:13.768 --> 24:15.633
I Want to put her
on a monthly stipend.

24:15.706 --> 24:17.401
Probably a good idea.

24:17.467 --> 24:21.832
Not all the doctors agree,

24:21.906 --> 24:24.000
But if I do only
have a few months,

24:24.066 --> 24:26.900
I Wanna take care
of all this now.

24:26.968 --> 24:29.930
Wait a second.
Which doctor doesn't agree?

24:30.035 --> 24:32.200
Feldman, the g
I told you about.

24:32.267 --> 24:34.862
- The fe mwiurderer?
- He's still a doctor,
anthony.

24:34.936 --> 24:38.202
He was a
highly-respected
oncologist.

24:38.265 --> 24:39.733
I Know, but, john--

24:39.808 --> 24:41.402
He reviewed my case.

24:41.467 --> 24:44.101
He says I could
hang on for years.

24:48.137 --> 24:50.832
You're right.
He still has
the knowledge.

24:50.905 --> 24:52.863
I Mean, o.j. Is no less
of a running back, right?

24:56.835 --> 25:00.502
Let me ask you
something, anthony:

25:03.768 --> 25:05.361
How will I be remembered?

25:07.665 --> 25:10.033
A wonderful husband.

25:10.108 --> 25:11.601
A loving father.

25:11.668 --> 25:13.932
On the street,
though, I mean.

25:14.007 --> 25:15.500
From what I know,
you were well-liked,
john.

25:15.568 --> 25:18.600
Respected across
the board, despite
the allocution even.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.133
God knows, guys have
actually named names

25:21.208 --> 25:23.300
For a hell of a lot less
than what you were
looking at.

25:23.365 --> 25:25.763
The only nega--

25:29.068 --> 25:30.560
What?

25:32.605 --> 25:35.601
When carmine died
and you took over,

25:35.665 --> 25:37.833
People felt you changed,

25:38.008 --> 25:41.261
Became a little
trigger-happy, maybe--

25:41.338 --> 25:42.501
A hothead.

25:46.308 --> 25:47.600
God forbid

25:47.667 --> 25:49.433
Any of them
would find themselves

25:49.507 --> 25:52.903
In that position.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.033
It's a thankless job.

26:13.968 --> 26:17.200
- What are you, hungover?
- What?  I Had two glasses
of wine.

26:17.268 --> 26:19.303
Why are you so pissy?

26:21.007 --> 26:24.163
- The portrayal of that guy
in the movie.
- What guy?

26:24.235 --> 26:26.501
- The boss, tony.
- What about him?

26:26.567 --> 26:29.263
It was based on you.

26:29.308 --> 26:31.261
Yeah, I know,
you said the yelling.

26:31.335 --> 26:32.800
It wasn't just
the yelling.

26:32.867 --> 26:34.662
Imitation's a form
of flattery.

26:34.737 --> 26:37.661
- You think that
was flattering?
- It was okay.

26:37.735 --> 26:39.302
He's a tough prick,
that baldwin.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.232
What about the girlfriend?

26:41.305 --> 26:43.162
- What girlfriend?
- The cleaver guy.

26:43.205 --> 26:46.203
The lead character.
His entire motive
for revenge.

26:46.266 --> 26:48.863
I Don't know.
You loste, carm.

26:48.937 --> 26:52.803
Sally boy, the boss,
he fucked the guy's fiancee.

26:55.837 --> 26:58.031
The thing with adriana?

26:58.107 --> 27:00.133
I Told you it never
fucking happened.

27:00.205 --> 27:02.363
Well, apparently,
your nephew feels otherwise.

27:02.435 --> 27:05.532
Ro pointed it out to me,
but if she saw it, that
means other people did.

27:05.608 --> 27:07.630
It's a movie.
It's fictional.

27:07.707 --> 27:10.033
It's a revenge fantasy, tony,

27:10.105 --> 27:13.631
Which ends with the boss's
head split open
by a meat cleaver.

27:20.335 --> 27:22.401
<I>( Dance music playing )

27:25.206 --> 27:28.502
Oh, there he is.
Good time last night?

27:28.565 --> 27:30.731
Yeah, it was all right.
How about you?

27:30.806 --> 27:34.201
Gab had
fucking nightmares.

27:35.906 --> 27:37.963
- Club soda, hon.
- Woman: <I>sure.

27:39.335 --> 27:41.261
So what did you think
tof movie?

27:41.367 --> 27:44.400
Chrissy's the last person
I would have confused
with marty,

27:44.466 --> 27:47.400
But I gotta say,
it wasn't bad.

27:49.465 --> 27:52.130
- Is he around?
- Chrissy?  Nah.

27:52.206 --> 27:54.162
He don't come around here
no more, you know that.

27:59.336 --> 28:02.360
That baldwin was
pretty good, huh?

28:07.207 --> 28:09.160
He was a mean fuck.
I'Ll give him that.

28:11.106 --> 28:14.102
And that girl that played
the fiancee, she was hot,

28:14.168 --> 28:16.531
The one he was fucking.

28:26.238 --> 28:29.360
It's weird how it works,
the creative process.

28:29.438 --> 28:31.303
I'M watching that movie
"edward scissorhands,"

28:31.366 --> 28:33.562
When boom,
all of a sudden,
it hits me.

28:33.636 --> 28:37.232
What if instead of a pair
of scissors, it's a meat
cleaver instead?

28:37.306 --> 28:40.401
A couple years later,
you got a movie.

28:40.465 --> 28:42.933
Originally, I thought
a ball-peen hammer,
but a cleaver's tter.

28:46.906 --> 28:49.201
I Tell ya, man, it's like
I'm living somebody
else's life.

28:49.267 --> 28:51.332
You're just not comfortabl
with success yet.

28:51.405 --> 28:53.460
I Know. It's scary.

28:53.535 --> 28:56.902
Feel the fear
and do it anyway.

28:56.967 --> 29:00.001
- Without chemicals, either.
- ( Cups clink )

29:03.108 --> 29:05.161
So kelli, the baby.

29:05.238 --> 29:07.963
Good, fucking great.

29:08.037 --> 29:11.462
She's a doll.
She cries a lot,
though.

29:11.535 --> 29:13.431
The baby, not kelli.

29:15.235 --> 29:16.833
I Hope you're taking
the time

29:16.908 --> 29:20.503
To reflect on all this.
Savor the good stuff.

29:20.565 --> 29:23.463
Yeah-- no, I am.

29:29.707 --> 29:31.602
Ere's my other
sober buddy.

29:31.667 --> 29:34.633
- Is that an fbi guy?
- Your tax dollars at work.

29:34.705 --> 29:37.832
Does he follow you
around all the time?

29:37.907 --> 29:40.263
They drop in and out.
It's fun.

29:43.136 --> 29:47.000
Look, seriously,
think where you were
just three months ago.

29:47.065 --> 29:49.963
<I>You came into that meeting.
yo <I>were so fucked up
<I>you could barely talk.

29:50.037 --> 29:51.803
And that woman friend
was even worse.

29:51.868 --> 29:54.903
I'Ve been trying
to do what you said--

29:54.966 --> 29:58.760
Hold back a little,
steer clear of old
habits, same people.

29:58.838 --> 30:02.532
Must be hard, though,
given your lifestyle.

30:02.607 --> 30:05.560
They already misinterpret,
I don't wanna hang around
so much.

30:05.636 --> 30:07.130
Fucking paulie especiall

30:07.206 --> 30:10.203
Have you explained how hard
it is to be around alcohol?

30:10.268 --> 30:13.630
- How familiar surroundings
set it off?
- They don't give a fuck.

30:21.167 --> 30:24.263
"But he's fucking
my wif ce,mine.
I Want him dead,"

30:24.335 --> 30:25.561
Jimmy says.

30:25.637 --> 30:28.830
"He will be," he said,
"but not just right now.

30:28.908 --> 30:31.102
He earns too much."

30:31.165 --> 30:35.003
Eight years later,
jimmy gets a call
one day.

30:35.066 --> 30:37.032
"Remember that guy who
we were talking about

30:37.108 --> 30:40.802
Who's fucking your wife?
He can go."

30:40.868 --> 30:42.861
The guy wasn't
making him money
no more.

30:42.937 --> 30:45.631
And that was
carmine lupertazzi.

30:45.705 --> 30:49.063
- Holy fucking shit.
- Yeah.

30:49.136 --> 30:51.600
There you are.
We went--

30:51.665 --> 30:53.360
John, what the hell
are you doing?

30:53.437 --> 30:56.200
- What?
- <I>You're smoking.

30:56.265 --> 30:58.803
- So?
- Daddy,
you're on oxygen.

31:00.865 --> 31:03.630
Warren, pardon me,
I'm sorry.

31:06.706 --> 31:08.962
Just calm down,
all right?

31:09.037 --> 31:10.961
Calm down?
I Don't fucking
believe you.

31:11.038 --> 31:14.430
( Sighs )
what do I got
to lose, gin?

31:14.508 --> 31:16.103
What's the difference?

31:16.167 --> 31:17.933
You told me dr. Feldman
doesn't agree
with the others.

31:18.005 --> 31:21.031
- Yeah, well.
- Miracles do happen, john.

31:21.108 --> 31:23.833
Not to this family
they don't.

31:23.908 --> 31:26.301
It's that kind of attitude
that probably brought this
on in the first place.

31:26.368 --> 31:28.862
You're gonna start
with that again?

31:28.938 --> 31:32.463
What about all these
six-year-olds with leukemia?

31:32.568 --> 31:34.962
What's that from,
all their negative thinking?

31:35.037 --> 31:37.560
<I>( Coughing )

31:53.335 --> 31:55.603
All due respect,
he's a great guy, doc,

31:55.667 --> 31:57.161
But boss material?

31:57.236 --> 31:59.762
Important thing's
we all work together,

31:59.837 --> 32:01.630
Whoever winds up
in the driver's seat.

32:01.706 --> 32:03.800
Phil, though,
I'll never get it.

32:03.906 --> 32:06.430
The man was my mentor.
It was right there
for the taking.

32:06.506 --> 32:08.830
His heart, gerry.
What was he gonna do?

32:08.908 --> 32:10.930
That's my point, though,
what you just said.

32:11.006 --> 32:13.700
Johnny goes away.
It's phil's turn
in the driver's seat,

32:13.765 --> 32:15.800
And his heart
gives out.

32:17.835 --> 32:19.032
- <I>Right.
- his heart.

32:19.135 --> 32:21.401
I Know, what?

32:21.466 --> 32:24.362
It's a metaphor.
He lost his balls
is what I'm saying.

32:24.435 --> 32:28.960
Just say it then.
Walt fucking whitman
over here.

32:29.037 --> 32:31.963
- Ladies.
- Hey.

32:32.038 --> 32:35.830
- How you doing?
- Should we get some
more wine?

32:35.906 --> 32:38.102
This fucking waiter,
on sabbatical?

32:38.168 --> 32:40.600
What's the name
of that sangiovese
we had at quattro gatti?

32:40.638 --> 32:42.963
- The night your--
- ( sound drops out )

32:48.538 --> 32:50.262
( Screaming )

32:54.808 --> 32:55.902
Come on!

33:03.235 --> 33:04.662
Let's go.

33:13.465 --> 33:15.632
Yeah, give me
five dimes apiece

33:15.705 --> 33:17.900
On st. Louis,

33:17.967 --> 33:21.260
Minnesota and baltimore.

33:28.168 --> 33:30.732
I Would have invited you
to play, but we already
had our fourth.

33:32.165 --> 33:34.360
You're not happy.

33:34.435 --> 33:36.261
Let's order.

33:37.665 --> 33:40.462
- What can I get you?
- Seared ahi, mixed greens

33:40.535 --> 33:42.031
And an iced tea,
please.

33:42.107 --> 33:45.161
Philly cheesesteak.

33:45.238 --> 33:47.960
You know what?
Give me an arnold palmer
instead of the iced tea.

33:48.036 --> 33:49.900
- Okay.
- I Always enjoy those,

33:50.005 --> 33:52.861
- But it never occurs to me
to order one.
- Wh the fuc carmine?

33:52.935 --> 33:54.963
This family of yours.

33:55.037 --> 33:58.461
Fucking senile doc santoro
uses one of my guys
as a diversion?

33:58.536 --> 34:01.333
Sil could have got hurt.

34:01.408 --> 34:02.860
Doc showed a lack
of respect.

34:07.936 --> 34:10.203
This fucking
leadership, boy.

34:10.266 --> 34:12.061
Step up, carmine.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.963
Get your hands around
this thing.  You know
you got the support.

34:20.166 --> 34:22.101
You never thought you'd
mutter those words,
d you?

34:22.165 --> 34:24.931
What do you want me
to say?

34:27.308 --> 34:29.632
I Hear you, tony,
and I'm flattered.

34:29.706 --> 34:31.231
But boss--
I don't think so,

34:31.304 --> 34:34.261
Especially now that doc
has cemented his position.

34:34.337 --> 34:36.132
Phil was bad enough
in the top spot,

34:36.206 --> 34:38.260
But him I could
have lived with.

34:38.338 --> 34:39.860
Here you go.

34:44.367 --> 34:47.302
There was a time
I was obsessed
with being in charge.

34:47.366 --> 34:49.360
- You remember?
- So do it.

34:52.437 --> 34:55.030
One night around then
I had this dream.

34:55.107 --> 34:57.531
It's my pop's 100th birthday,
even though he'd been dead
for years.

34:57.607 --> 35:00.160
The whole family's there--
grandkids, everybody.

35:00.235 --> 35:03.830
He's wearing one of these
gold paper crowns,

35:03.907 --> 35:05.462
Like at burger king.

35:07.805 --> 35:11.300
This mellifluous box--
ribbons.ent,

35:11.368 --> 35:13.303
He opens it up
then looks at me.

35:13.367 --> 35:16.800
This gaze of absolute
disappointment.

35:16.868 --> 35:19.233
There's nothing
in the box.

35:19.305 --> 35:21.200
So he hands it back
to me.

35:21.308 --> 35:23.302
"Go fill it up,"
he says.

35:23.365 --> 35:25.203
"Come back when I'm 200."

35:25.268 --> 35:27.732
So go for it, carmine.

35:27.805 --> 35:29.230
Fulfill that part
of yourself.

35:31.905 --> 35:35.662
We have this ritual
at my house for years.

35:35.737 --> 35:37.332
Our kids are
in boarding school.

35:37.405 --> 35:41.231
Every night I come home
from work, I strip down,
jump naked in the pool.

35:41.338 --> 35:42.902
Nicole brings me
a scotch and water.

35:42.968 --> 35:45.302
We sit,
relax a littletalk.

35:45.368 --> 35:48.333
I Go up to bed,
the air conditioning.

35:48.406 --> 35:51.661
She brings me a light
dinner on a tray.

35:51.738 --> 35:54.200
One night during
all that fighting with john,

35:54.268 --> 35:56.932
I Come home,
I'm exhausted.

35:57.006 --> 35:59.761
So tired, so tense,
I skip the pool.

35:59.838 --> 36:02.902
I Go right upstairs,
flop on the bed.

36:02.967 --> 36:06.000
Nicole comes up
with a drink.

36:06.066 --> 36:08.232
She says, "darling,

36:08.308 --> 36:09.933
I Think it's time
you took a rest."

36:10.007 --> 36:11.931
I Say, "I'm gonna.
We're gonna take a vacation."

36:12.006 --> 36:14.233
She says,
"that's not what I meant.

36:14.265 --> 36:17.361
I Don't wanna be
the wealthiest widow
on long island.

36:17.436 --> 36:20.160
I Want you to quit now."

36:22.906 --> 36:25.100
I'M not ashamed to say
that she made me cry.

36:25.168 --> 36:27.031
That wonderful
loving woman.

36:30.868 --> 36:33.730
That dream with my father,
the empty box--

36:33.808 --> 36:37.002
It wasn't about
being boss.

36:37.065 --> 36:38.301
It was about
being happy.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.763
Warren, hi.

36:50.836 --> 36:52.502
Hi, hon.
How's he doing?

36:52.566 --> 36:56.462
Listen, I've been
meaning to talk to you
about the smoking.

36:56.535 --> 36:58.933
John shared with me
how upset you were.

36:59.006 --> 37:02.830
Psychologically,
when a person's
told they're dying,

37:02.905 --> 37:04.831
It's the ultimate
loss of control.

37:04.905 --> 37:06.833
To hear him wheeze
like that...

37:06.907 --> 37:10.161
I Know. It doesn't
make any sense.

37:10.238 --> 37:12.400
I Do know
he's a leader.

37:12.465 --> 37:14.931
I Suspect his smoking
on some level

37:15.006 --> 37:19.031
Is an attempt
to die as he lived--

37:19.107 --> 37:21.361
In total control.

37:21.436 --> 37:23.530
Years ago, I asked him
to stop for me
and the kids.

37:23.607 --> 37:26.701
I Lost 27 lbs.
He couldn't quit smoking?

37:29.705 --> 37:32.132
I Gotta go.

37:38.905 --> 37:41.601
Goodbye, caitlin.
I'Ll see you soon, muffin.

37:41.667 --> 37:43.963
Oh my god.
I Love these little hands.

37:44.037 --> 37:45.963
Thanks so much
for watching her.

37:46.037 --> 37:49.261
You'd think we're planning
a coronation instead
of ais chrning.

37:49.337 --> 37:52.530
- We all set?
- You know what?
I'D better pee.

37:52.606 --> 37:55.903
Goody, I get
to keep holding you.

38:02.005 --> 38:05.433
So how you doi
ng?tony said you got an offer
on the house you built.

38:05.506 --> 38:06.801
Two, aually, yes.

38:06.865 --> 38:09.230
Ivana trump.

38:13.107 --> 38:16.133
I Gotta be honest.
I Am very disappointed
at what you did.

38:16.137 --> 38:18.360
- What are you
talking about?
- Your movie.

38:18.437 --> 38:20.732
The boss sleeping
with the other guy's
fiancee?

38:20.807 --> 38:24.363
- At?
- Please, like that wasn't
based on tony and ade.

38:24.435 --> 38:26.303
What? No.

38:26.368 --> 38:27.761
Carmela, I didn't
even write it.

38:27.838 --> 38:29.900
Story by
christopher moltisanti.

38:29.968 --> 38:31.931
Isn't that what it said
up there on the screen?

38:32.005 --> 38:34.700
Yeah, but that's just
for the writers guild
health insurance.

38:34.765 --> 38:37.761
- Oh, really?
- Come on,
you can't be serious.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.203
She's an oriental,
for christ sake.

38:41.408 --> 38:43.233
Have you heard
from ade lately?

38:43.307 --> 38:46.133
No, why would I hear
from her?

38:46.207 --> 38:47.733
Would it be
so surprising?

38:47.838 --> 38:49.861
She left me
for some other guy.

38:49.935 --> 38:51.731
Is it any wonder?

38:51.806 --> 38:54.260
Her poor mother is
so upset, she's
practically delusional.

38:54.337 --> 38:56.530
She's convinced herself
that ade is dead.

38:56.605 --> 38:58.731
Her mother's an alky.
You know that.

38:58.807 --> 39:01.362
Regardless, christopher.

39:01.438 --> 39:04.002
You're my cousin,
and I love you, carmela,

39:04.068 --> 39:05.932
But I don't like what
you're inferring here,

39:06.005 --> 39:09.401
Either with the movie
or how I treated adriana.

39:09.506 --> 39:11.803
Kelli comes out,
tell her I went
to smoke.

39:19.037 --> 39:21.562
There's my pal.
How you doing?

39:21.635 --> 39:24.400
"Billy bathgate."
they had it
in the library.

39:24.465 --> 39:26.462
I Thought of you.

39:27.867 --> 39:31.003
I Don't know if you heard,
but gerry torciano,

39:31.067 --> 39:32.803
<I>He was hit last week
<I>in brooklyn.

39:32.865 --> 39:35.433
- Who?
- Gerry torciano.

39:35.506 --> 39:37.561
<I>It was all over
<I>the news.

39:37.638 --> 39:39.800
They whacked him
in some restaurant.

39:41.636 --> 39:43.230
Did you know him?

39:43.307 --> 39:45.401
Yeah.

39:47.135 --> 39:50.161
I Don't kn.
Good guy.

39:52.065 --> 39:56.433
It's hard to breat.he

40:04.267 --> 40:06.803
I'Ll talk to gupte,

40:06.866 --> 40:10.503
See if I can get him
to up the beclovent.

40:11.836 --> 40:14.262
I'M dying, aren't I?

40:20.205 --> 40:21.932
It's not good.

40:22.005 --> 40:24.032
I Won't lie to you.

40:24.105 --> 40:26.701
The aggressiveness
surprises me.

40:29.007 --> 40:32.602
I Gotta concur
with rosen.

40:40.936 --> 40:43.833
I Appreciate everything
you've done, warren.

40:47.405 --> 40:50.903
- <I>( Doorbell ringing )
- <I>( knocking on door )

40:54.365 --> 40:56.500
- Who is it?
- Christopher: <I>you don't
<I> answer your phone?

40:57.936 --> 40:59.933
I Shut the ringer.
It's the middle
of the night.

41:00.007 --> 41:01.463
Woman:
<I>honey, what's wrong?

41:01.537 --> 41:04.901
Nothing, sweetie, it's
fine.  Go back to sleep.

41:04.966 --> 41:06.763
It ain't fine.
We got a problem.

41:06.836 --> 41:09.233
That whole sequence
with sally boy banging
the fiancee,

41:09.306 --> 41:11.833
You gotta tell tony
that was your idea.

41:11.907 --> 41:13.801
It wasn't my idea.

41:13.866 --> 41:17.433
What, are you fucking stupid
he probably thinks I put it
in there to embarrass him.

41:17.508 --> 41:20.030
- Why did you put it in there?
- It was an idea.

41:20.106 --> 41:22.700
I Don't know.
O knows where
they fucking come from?

41:22.766 --> 41:25.760
Isaac newton invented gravity
'cause some asshole hit him
with an apple.

41:25.835 --> 41:28.333
It's bad enough that I don't
get credit for my own ideas.

41:28.407 --> 41:31.563
Now I'm supposed to take
responsibility for some shit
that's gonna get me in tuble?

41:31.637 --> 41:34.600
Fuck that, man.

41:37.236 --> 41:40.063
<I>Humanitas award.
What's that?

41:40.138 --> 41:42.260
Humanitas.
From the paulist brothers,

41:42.336 --> 41:44.231
For writing themes
of socially redeeming--

41:44.306 --> 41:46.501
Ow!

41:46.565 --> 41:50.331
Look out the window.
You see a fucking
hollywood sign out there?

41:50.406 --> 41:52.403
Maybe you talk
to your agent like that,

41:52.468 --> 41:55.060
T but ever get fucking
snippy on me again.

42:07.136 --> 42:09.832
The fucking scary thing was
I didn't know what happened

42:09.906 --> 42:11.600
Till afterhe tt
was fired.

42:11.668 --> 42:14.730
Fucking weird.

42:14.805 --> 42:17.761
- To, hey. Gentlemen.
- Hey, how are you?

42:17.838 --> 42:18.830
T.j. Hooker.

42:18.908 --> 42:21.703
J.t., actually,

42:21.766 --> 42:24.733
But I'm looking for chris.

42:24.806 --> 42:26.633
I'M supposed
to meet him.

42:26.708 --> 42:28.730
What, here?

42:28.805 --> 42:31.002
<I>The thing is
<I>he left me a message,

42:31.068 --> 42:34.061
But this fucking verizon--

42:34.136 --> 42:36.462
- Mind if I wait?
- Yeah, sit down.

42:36.537 --> 42:39.603
- Diet coke,lease.
- Woman: <I>you got it.

42:42.505 --> 42:44.461
So what did you think
of "cleaver"?

42:44.537 --> 42:47.631
It's good, you know.

42:47.706 --> 42:49.231
Congratulations.

42:49.308 --> 42:51.962
I Hope we're gonna see
some money soon.

42:52.038 --> 42:54.502
Yeah.

42:56.937 --> 42:58.900
As a writer,
you can never tell,
you know?

42:58.967 --> 43:02.163
You come up with an idea.
You don't know how the audience
is gonna respond.

43:02.236 --> 43:05.130
I Mean, justusecai like somethin

43:05.208 --> 43:06.260
Doesn't mean
anyone else will.

43:06.336 --> 43:08.000
That's the challenge.

43:08.067 --> 43:10.130
It is challenging
sometimes,

43:10.207 --> 43:12.601
Inventing characters,
how they interact.

43:12.668 --> 43:14.961
The boss sally boy
for example,

43:15.037 --> 43:18.462
His whole persona--

43:18.538 --> 43:20.662
I Stole that from broderick
crawford in "born yesterday."

43:20.738 --> 43:23.232
What's that?

43:23.305 --> 43:25.832
Garson kanin, 1950.
It's terrific.

43:25.908 --> 43:29.702
William holden falls in love
with crawford's girlfr,iendplayed by

43:29.766 --> 43:31.032
The black girl,
the singer.

43:31.105 --> 43:32.731
No, that's billie holiday.

43:32.807 --> 43:35.531
Although judy's character
in the movie

43:35.606 --> 43:38.161
Is named billie
too, so I can see
why you're confused.

43:38.237 --> 43:41.302
I'Ve never seen it.
Why would I be confused?

43:43.407 --> 43:46.002
Anyway,
the sally boy character

43:46.107 --> 43:49.703
Is based on crawford--
sort of a big,
burly guy.

43:49.768 --> 43:53.330
The love triangle,
the cuckolding of michael,
sleeping with the fiancee,

43:53.407 --> 43:56.561
Very similar to
the holden-holliday dynamic.

43:59.767 --> 44:01.732
So the whole thing
was your idea.

44:06.936 --> 44:08.960
- What happened
to your head?
- What?on kanin.

44:10.535 --> 44:13.361
Oh. Cabinet.

44:13.436 --> 44:14.901
Duh.

44:20.707 --> 44:24.030
If I see chrissy,
I'll tell him you were
looking for him.

44:37.408 --> 44:39.431
Now listen to me,
you two heels.
I Mean business.

44:39.508 --> 44:42.130
I Got too much at stakedown here. You g
that belongs to me.

44:42.237 --> 44:44.361
If you wanna get out
of here alive, you better
give it back.

44:44.438 --> 44:46.231
Now I'm no blowhard.
Tell him.

44:46.306 --> 44:49.860
He's no blowhard.
He's had people
killed before.

44:49.938 --> 44:52.530
- About six years ago,
there was this guy--
- shut up!

44:52.608 --> 44:54.703
You ain't gonna be
telling nobody nothing
pretty soon.

44:57.936 --> 45:00.760
This is the image of me
he leaves to the world.

45:04.636 --> 45:07.963
I Remember when he
was born, I would
hold him in my arms.

45:10.805 --> 45:13.161
He was an adorable kid,
too.

45:13.238 --> 45:14.661
Big eyes.

45:14.738 --> 45:17.203
You always talk
about him

45:17.266 --> 45:18.803
More like a son.

45:18.865 --> 45:21.103
In some ways he was,

45:21.165 --> 45:22.763
Especiallyfter
his dad died.

45:22.865 --> 45:25.763
He was little.
I Used to give him rides.

45:25.837 --> 45:29.063
I'D put him in the basket
of the butcher bike,

45:29.138 --> 45:31.330
Pedahim around,

45:31.408 --> 45:34.203
Back when satriale's
made deliveries.

45:34.265 --> 45:36.831
I Reminded him
of that recently.

45:38.708 --> 45:40.802
- He didn't remember.
- But you do.

45:40.867 --> 45:42.803
We had fun.

45:45.706 --> 45:47.861
All those memories,
and for what?

45:49.506 --> 45:51.500
All I am to him
is some asshole bully.

45:57.506 --> 45:59.830
You're hurt.

46:05.508 --> 46:09.460
His dad dickie was

46:09.538 --> 46:11.901
Like my me to him.

46:12.006 --> 46:13.332
A mentor.

46:13.405 --> 46:16.261
Yeah, but more
than that,

46:16.337 --> 46:18.303
A friend,

46:18.365 --> 46:20.332
A fucking guy
you could look up to.

46:20.407 --> 46:23.431
And the hope is that
you pass that shit down,

46:25.106 --> 46:27.961
The respect
and the love.

46:32.066 --> 46:33.960
Aldid
for this fucking kid

46:34.037 --> 46:36.032
And he fucking hates me
so much.

46:36.107 --> 46:38.901
I'M sure on some level
he loves you, too.

46:39.007 --> 46:40.731
Yeah?

46:40.806 --> 46:43.732
Taket thame.
Judge for yourself.

46:43.806 --> 46:46.031
Last five minutes
should answer
that question.

46:46.107 --> 46:47.860
I'M not going to do that.

46:47.935 --> 46:50.800
- Not a horror fan?
- It's what you think
that matters.

46:53.007 --> 46:56.732
I Think he
fucking despises m
e.'s pretty obvious.

46:56.806 --> 46:58.361
Wants to see me dead.

47:05.138 --> 47:08.060
Without invalidating
your feelings,

47:08.166 --> 47:10.802
Is it possible that
on some level

47:10.867 --> 47:13.002
You're reading
into all this?

47:18.937 --> 47:22.301
I'Ve been coming here
for years.

47:22.366 --> 47:25.061
I Know too much
about the subconscious now.

47:38.506 --> 47:40.401
Look, sweetie,

47:40.467 --> 47:43.231
They're nice and clean
like you like them.

47:43.307 --> 47:45.101
Mommy, he can't
really hear you.

47:45.165 --> 47:48.131
The right here
by the bed.

47:56.107 --> 47:58.232
- Johnny: <I>my...
- what, baby, your what?

47:58.306 --> 48:01.102
Want more morphine,
daddy?

48:02.108 --> 48:05.032
Mo-- mother.

48:05.105 --> 48:07.832
Grandma? What, daddy?

48:07.906 --> 48:09.331
Is he hallucinating?

48:09.408 --> 48:12.161
Allegra:
<I>I don't know.
<I>he could be.

48:12.235 --> 48:14.760
Sometimes they see
people who've passed.

48:14.835 --> 48:17.331
John, look at me, baby.

48:32.506 --> 48:35.661
You want a cigte,
baby?  John.

48:46.935 --> 48:49.303
You can't do that
when you're on my
fucking team?

48:50.608 --> 48:52.632
Hey, ton',

48:52.705 --> 48:55.061
Send him in.

48:55.138 --> 48:58.133
There he is.
X-ray specs.

48:58.207 --> 49:01.102
- How's john?
- That's why I'm here, tony.

49:01.165 --> 49:02.831
John passed away
late this morning.

49:04.466 --> 49:06.331
Oh, fuck,
you're kidding me.

49:06.406 --> 49:09.101
I Only wh.

49:15.605 --> 49:19.230
He was a great guy, john.
Sorry for your loss.

49:19.306 --> 49:22.900
Thanks.
Honestly, though,
it was for the best.

49:30.008 --> 49:31.960
What y are gonna do?

49:32.035 --> 49:35.261
I Beat cancer,
but it took him out.

49:35.336 --> 49:37.702
( Quotes rock song )

49:37.766 --> 49:39.360
Huh?

49:40.668 --> 49:43.462
John sacrimoni,
<I>a buon' anima.

49:43.536 --> 49:45.731
All: <I>a buon' anima.

49:56.108 --> 49:58.860
Phil: <I>we're here to celebrate
<I>what would have been
<I>my brother's--

49:58.935 --> 50:01.401
Your uncle's--
47th birthday.

50:01.466 --> 50:03.233
- Blow it out for him.
- ( Blowing )

50:03.306 --> 50:06.031
( Cheering )

50:07.665 --> 50:10.203
Right here at th bis,
this seat

50:10.267 --> 50:12.703
Was uncle billy's
favorite place in
the whole world.

50:12.767 --> 50:14.660
More than shea stadium?

50:14.738 --> 50:16.261
More than shea stadium.

50:16.335 --> 50:19.400
He'd sit with his
friends and tell stories
about his family,

50:19.466 --> 50:22.863
Who he loved more
than anything and was
so very proud of.

50:28.067 --> 50:31.901
From now on,
his ashes will be
right here

50:31.935 --> 50:35.031
So when his
friends come to visit,
he can see them.

50:35.108 --> 50:36.960
- Can he see us now?
- Patty: <I>yeah.

50:37.035 --> 50:40.432
- Who knows who is
leonardo da vinci?
- I Do.

50:40.508 --> 50:43.103
- Matty.
- Yeah, he wrote
"the da vinci code."

50:43.168 --> 50:46.961
Another man wrote that,
but it's a hideous
sacrilegious book.

50:47.036 --> 50:50.302
- Annabella.
- Heas a painter,

50:50.368 --> 50:52.002
Of the "mona lisa."

50:52.067 --> 50:55.531
Very good.
He was not only a painter,
he did medical drawings,

50:55.607 --> 50:58.463
- And he designed a ta
nkfor the army.
- Boy: <I>wow.

50:58.535 --> 51:00.462
Leonardo was
a great italian,

51:00.567 --> 51:02.632
And that was our name
originally, leonardo.

51:02.707 --> 51:06.031
But many years ago,
when my grandpa
came over from sicily,

51:06.105 --> 51:09.132
They changed it
at ellis island
to leotardo.

51:09.206 --> 51:10.760
What did they
do that for?

51:10.838 --> 51:14.162
Because they're stupid,
that's why, and jealous.

51:14.235 --> 51:17.031
They disrespected
a proud italian heritage

51:17.105 --> 51:20.863
And named us
after a ballet costume.

51:20.938 --> 51:25.100
- Marissa.
- That's for modern.
In ballet, you wear tutus.

51:25.166 --> 51:27.160
It doesn't make
a difference.

51:29.168 --> 51:32.603
- That's right, it doesn't.
- Can we havkee caow?

52:03.505 --> 52:05.162
How you doing, phil?

52:05.238 --> 52:07.363
You okay?

52:08.735 --> 52:12.060
47--
Whe fucking kid.

52:13.136 --> 52:15.903
Me, I'm an oanld m

52:19.368 --> 52:21.930
I'D like to do it over,
boy.  Let me tell you.

52:23.368 --> 52:25.302
I Fucking compromised
everything.

52:25.408 --> 52:27.632
Nah, what are you
talking about?

52:27.707 --> 52:29.401
<I>20 Years inside,

52:29.467 --> 52:31.230
Not a fucking peep.

52:31.307 --> 52:33.433
For what?
To protect the likes

52:33.506 --> 52:36.860
Of rusty fucking millio,
doc santoro?

52:36.936 --> 52:40.563
You were a man, phil.
That's saying a lot
nowadays.

52:48.738 --> 52:51.860
That cocksucking piece of shit
tony soprano's cousin--

52:53.238 --> 52:56.533
I Can't even
say his name--

52:56.607 --> 52:59.603
Murdered billie.
And what did I do
about it?

53:02.206 --> 53:05.032
My weakness.

53:05.107 --> 53:07.933
Sometimes I think
it's in my dna.

53:08.007 --> 53:10.061
My family took shit
from the <I>medigans

53:10.135 --> 53:11.401
The minute we got
off the boat.

53:11.465 --> 53:13.730
Come on, what the fuck
you talking about?

53:13.807 --> 53:16.300
Leotardo.

53:16.365 --> 53:18.301
That's my fucking legacy.

53:25.507 --> 53:28.133
No more, butchie.

53:28.237 --> 53:30.333
No more of this.
