WEBVTT

00:04.700 --> 00:06.031
Your figure is changing.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.341
I'm not pregnant

00:07.390 --> 00:09.699
Am I suppose to
believe it's mine?

00:09.740 --> 00:11.469
I know I'm the father Lorna.

00:11.530 --> 00:15.136
I couldn't tell you. I needed
to keep a clear head.

00:15.180 --> 00:17.705
This is what girls do,
they date boys.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.662
So don't go telling me
where my heart is.

00:20.710 --> 00:23.668
I gave my daughter life,
you will not destroy it.

00:25.410 --> 00:29.323
They want to come at us
I'm going to come right
back at them.

00:29.370 --> 00:33.283
Daddy, a fund-raiser's no place
for some crass publicity stunt.

00:33.330 --> 00:37.027
This is your life. It's time
you chose to preserve it.

00:54.610 --> 00:58.262
I'm the one thing you
can't kill, Marion.

01:14.460 --> 01:17.714
Betty!

01:17.770 --> 01:19.670
Damn. You okay?

01:19.730 --> 01:23.769
Last night I was scared he
was dead and now I'm
scared he isn't.

01:23.820 --> 01:25.208
Your father's gone.

01:25.250 --> 01:28.299
We don't know for sure,
did you check his pulse,

01:28.340 --> 01:29.739
see if he was breathing?

01:29.780 --> 01:33.568
Kate, you saw it yourself.
He's dead.

01:33.610 --> 01:37.603
What if I was wrong?
What if he's out there still?

01:37.660 --> 01:41.130
I need to go back,
I need to see for sure.

01:41.180 --> 01:45.708
Okay, I'll punch out early.

01:55.980 --> 01:57.629
Morning, girls.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.195
Good I'm not the
only early-riser.

02:01.250 --> 02:02.592
Happy Valentine's Day!

02:02.640 --> 02:04.119
Oh thanks.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.728
Oh I'm fine.

02:08.780 --> 02:12.034
I was up half the night working
my next steps with the family.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.685
Nothing like cutting out
hearts to clear the head.

02:14.740 --> 02:17.732
If they think they can
trundle me out every time

02:17.780 --> 02:19.338
they need a company mascot?

02:19.400 --> 02:21.914
They're off my
Valentine's list.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.690
It's a lovely card,
Gladys. Thank you.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.389
You're like family. Better.

02:27.450 --> 02:31.147
That's why I decided, there's
no way I'm moving back home.

02:31.190 --> 02:33.829
I've already sent for my bags.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.710
Betty could put
in a word here.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.320
Yeah except with so many
girls out there,

02:38.370 --> 02:42.716
Mrs. Groot needs references.
Former employers, landlords.

02:42.770 --> 02:45.933
I doubt my mother could
find a good word.

02:45.990 --> 02:50.598
I'll ponder this over a bath.
This will take some thought.

03:02.530 --> 03:06.307
Sorry, thought I had the
room to myself.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.227
I heard Dolores head
back to Guelph.

03:09.270 --> 03:12.706
A lot of these rookies don't
know what they're in for.

03:12.750 --> 03:17.141
Yeah I can't get any hot
water in this place.

03:17.190 --> 03:19.715
You want some?

03:32.080 --> 03:33.729
Isn't he a little bruiser?

03:33.770 --> 03:36.386
Suits you nice, Lorna.

03:36.430 --> 03:38.159
You must be so happy.

03:38.210 --> 03:40.519
Oh he's a joy,
can't deny it.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.255
We miss you on the line.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.904
Oh, I'll be back soon.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.780
Kenny's going into
the day nursery.

03:45.830 --> 03:48.651
Boy, wish they'd thought
of that before the war!

03:48.700 --> 03:56.402
Best move on, Francine
this is hardly the safest
place for a child.

03:56.450 --> 04:00.181
Seems sad going to the
trouble to make a child

04:00.240 --> 04:02.367
only to give it
to someone else.

04:02.410 --> 04:06.881
We do so much nowadays no harm
in leaning on a little help.

04:06.940 --> 04:09.545
Carol, you are one
stand-up friend.

04:09.590 --> 04:12.377
Barely, after lugging these.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.809
What did my mother say?
Was she angry?

04:14.860 --> 04:16.987
She's the one who
packed your bags.

04:17.030 --> 04:18.588
You can't be serious.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.167
Told me you'd be back by
the time you need your
smalls washed.

04:22.210 --> 04:23.768
I'll send for the rest.

04:23.820 --> 04:26.129
A token of my appreciation.

04:26.170 --> 04:28.126
Happy Valentine's Day.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.602
How thoughtful!

04:29.660 --> 04:32.823
Well, I don't have James here
to make a big to-do over.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.178
Let me take you out tonight.

04:35.230 --> 04:37.915
With no dates? We'll look
desperate.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.699
I am, Carol.

04:39.750 --> 04:43.880
There's troubles and I'm
looking to forget them.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.459
Here comes Cupid!

04:50.500 --> 04:52.320
Pass the ammunition, boys!

04:52.370 --> 04:54.418
Here's one for you.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.985
And one for you.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.543
Oops, and another!

04:58.600 --> 05:00.329
Don't worry got something
for everyone.

05:00.380 --> 05:03.554
Us fellows here like
to hedge our bets.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.851
Says here,

05:04.910 --> 05:07.208
"When it comes time to
write this war's history,

05:07.260 --> 05:09.820
a golden page will be the
defense of Singapore."

05:09.870 --> 05:14.216
Sure hope they're right.
Seems there's a lot of
fire raining down on us.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.340
The best fire those
Japs can drop?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.618
Little notes, telling
our boys to surrender.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.742
As if we'd ever give in.

05:20.790 --> 05:22.269
Depends what you read.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.141
I get letters from James,
he may head to Europe soon.

05:25.190 --> 05:27.363
Says we're in for
a tough fight.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.844
Gladys. Gladys. And Gladys.
Someone's got a fan.

05:29.890 --> 05:34.236
Tell 'em my fianc's
training to be a war hero.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.019
You looking through
the lonely hearts?

05:36.070 --> 05:38.504
Not many soldiers go
for a scraped-up gal.

05:38.550 --> 05:42.509
And you? Looking to
tarnish your halo tonight?

05:42.550 --> 05:44.427
I may have a date.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.382
You have fun.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.729
Smile when you're
giving it to Hitler.

05:58.220 --> 06:02.611
I say we nab ourselves a
mickey of rum and go
drunk-bowling, just us.

06:02.660 --> 06:06.187
Sounds better than
a bouquet of roses.

06:06.230 --> 06:10.439
Ivan. That's very sweet.

06:14.060 --> 06:16.108
Thank you.

06:16.150 --> 06:19.153
Dine and dance at the
Jewel Box tonight?

06:19.200 --> 06:23.022
Except my friend's in town.
I'd feel awful ditching her.

06:23.070 --> 06:27.279
Then I'll bring a buddy.
We'll make it a real romp, yeah?

06:27.340 --> 06:29.558
Okay.

06:29.600 --> 06:36.381
This is for you from
a secret admirer.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.307
You busy tonight?

06:38.350 --> 06:40.602
Ha. I'd forgot it was
even Valentine's.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.173
That's too bad.

06:42.220 --> 06:44.871
If anyone deserves a lie-in
with a little breakfast in bed.

06:44.920 --> 06:52.019
Marco, I couldn't do it.

06:52.060 --> 06:56.668
I felt the baby move.
And I just couldn't.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.884
What about your husband?
What are you going to tell him?

07:00.940 --> 07:05.240
I've forgiven a lot,
now it's his turn.

07:05.290 --> 07:10.239
Look maybe it's God's will,
meant to be together you and I.

07:10.290 --> 07:17.253
Marco, Marco, I can't
do this with you.

07:17.300 --> 07:18.608
You have to quit.

07:18.650 --> 07:20.732
It's my job. I have to work.

07:20.780 --> 07:22.122
And this is my child.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.398
Dont,dontu.

07:24.440 --> 07:29.264
Now Lorna, please
one thing I ask.

07:29.310 --> 07:32.928
Keep that baby safe.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.065
A double date?

07:44.110 --> 07:45.805
Forget it, it's
a stupid idea.

07:45.850 --> 07:47.545
No we should do it!

07:47.590 --> 07:48.579
You sure?

07:48.640 --> 07:50.983
Yeah, act as if
everything's normal.

07:59.430 --> 08:00.863
There it is.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.788
I'll do it.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.795
They've must have
found the body.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.182
We'll talk to the police.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.186
We can't talk to the police!

08:22.240 --> 08:25.619
They'll wonder why we
waited, think we
deliberately killed him.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.752
I gotta go; gotta leave town.

08:27.810 --> 08:30.893
We walk away from this,
we do not run.

08:30.940 --> 08:35.377
You said it yourself,
act normal.

08:35.420 --> 08:38.071
This never happened,
you understand?

08:38.120 --> 08:39.246
You're Kate now.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.872
What do you want, Lorna?

09:01.930 --> 09:04.273
A change. For myself.

09:04.320 --> 09:09.269
A new job away from the
line, the chemicals,
danger...

09:09.330 --> 09:12.413
You're a rock to these girls.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.894
God knows what would
happen if you left.

09:14.940 --> 09:16.635
I spoke with the
kitchen about...

09:16.680 --> 09:19.410
Kitchen? Bunch of
Chinese in there!

09:19.470 --> 09:22.689
And hard workers.
I'd fit right in.

09:22.730 --> 09:25.039
You worked hard to
get where you are.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.345
Why go make less money
on some low-level job?

09:28.390 --> 09:33.123
Harold, it's what
I want.

09:33.180 --> 09:36.172
Please just post
for a transfer.

09:39.180 --> 09:42.707
You can try getting a
reference from Mr. Aikins,

09:42.750 --> 09:46.186
but you really think he'd
stand up against your father?

09:46.230 --> 09:48.790
Oh Vera, that rum tonight
can't come quick enough.

09:48.840 --> 09:52.492
Let's swing through Eaton's,
try on hats and spritz
ourselves with Chanel.

09:52.540 --> 09:55.839
Wouldn't want to be mistaken for
one of those round-heeled girls

09:55.890 --> 09:56.891
there on parade?

09:56.940 --> 09:58.760
What do they call them;
patriotutes?

09:58.810 --> 10:02.200
I'd hate it if folks thought
we were waiting for soldiers

10:02.250 --> 10:05.026
to pick us up.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.329
Oh my God.

10:13.650 --> 10:15.436
I can't believe it.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.868
James!

10:16.920 --> 10:20.879
Hey sweetheart. Happy
Valentine's day.

10:25.530 --> 10:28.055
It's a safe bet,
bowling's off.

10:31.190 --> 10:32.669
This can't be real!

10:32.710 --> 10:35.622
You got leave from training?
How long?

10:35.670 --> 10:38.628
We ship out overseas
come Monday.

10:38.680 --> 10:43.765
Here comes the war.

10:57.350 --> 10:58.692
Damn it!

11:19.110 --> 11:21.408
Hey sweetheart!

11:41.300 --> 11:43.256
I heard it comes
down to water.

11:43.310 --> 11:47.303
If they can hold onto the
reservoirs, the Brits can
hold onto Singapore.

11:47.350 --> 11:49.079
But the Japs
took one today.

11:49.140 --> 11:52.041
But not both.
That's why we got a spare.

11:52.100 --> 11:55.058
So what do you think, Kate?
The good guys win?

11:55.100 --> 11:58.922
I sure hope so.

11:58.970 --> 11:59.880
Thank you.

11:59.930 --> 12:01.795
Lime cordial.

12:01.850 --> 12:03.067
My favourite.

12:03.110 --> 12:07.228
I know. I still keep a bottle.

12:56.030 --> 12:57.338
Are you okay?

12:57.380 --> 12:58.859
I keep seeing him.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.460
Kate, you'll make
yourself crazy.

13:01.510 --> 13:03.944
I'm afraid I need
to beat a retreat.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.991
Okay then, we'll go home.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.645
Bad news boys, we gotta cut
short the evening.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.304
Kate isn't feeling so great.

13:10.350 --> 13:11.954
But the night just started.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.389
It's Valentine's Day!

13:14.440 --> 13:20.185
Hey I thought we'd get a bit
of time, kick the ball up the
field a little.

13:20.230 --> 13:24.610
I know. Me too. Soon.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.490
I guess these are for you.

13:33.550 --> 13:38.453
Relax I won't make
you put out for It.

13:38.510 --> 13:42.719
And to finish off?
Apple cinnamon.

13:42.770 --> 13:44.169
My favourite.

13:44.210 --> 13:47.509
After twenty-five years,
you think I don't know
that?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.118
Try it.

13:49.170 --> 13:53.869
Beats me how you do it Lora,
work a job and run the house.

13:53.920 --> 13:58.869
Truth be told, all this
juggling has left me
sixes and sevens.

13:58.920 --> 14:03.095
Since you brought up my
being pregnant the other
day, I got thinking, and...

14:03.140 --> 14:04.869
Turns out, I might be right?

14:04.930 --> 14:08.479
Exactly! Though at my age
what are the chances?

14:08.540 --> 14:11.054
Still, I thought I'd
pay Dr. Ryan a visit.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.931
Won't he be surprised to see me
in his waiting room again...

14:13.980 --> 14:17.711
[BANG]

14:17.760 --> 14:22.060
Are you going to
take care of it?

14:22.120 --> 14:23.894
It's too late for that now.

14:23.950 --> 14:30.037
Too late. Well, I guess now you
can claim enough time passed

14:30.080 --> 14:33.038
_since our little
night of passmn.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.162
Well? That's what it was.

14:35.220 --> 14:38.087
You're off your game, Lore.

14:38.130 --> 14:45.571
This fellow has done a
real number on you.

14:45.620 --> 14:53.277
I slipped. This man,
he saw me, Bob.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.882
Inside. I stopped thinking.

14:57.940 --> 15:04.766
Trust me, Lore.
I see you too.

15:10.990 --> 15:13.777
Hey sugar. You looking
for a soldier?

15:15.610 --> 15:20.388
Vera !

15:20.440 --> 15:21.737
Hey! How are you?

15:21.790 --> 15:25.305
I didn't recognize Cupid
with his clothes on.

15:25.350 --> 15:26.783
What are you doing here?

15:26.830 --> 15:29.264
Just out clearing my head.
How about you?

15:29.310 --> 15:33.872
I was just... window shopping.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.537
Wanna grab some ice cream
at Fran's?

15:41.590 --> 15:44.491
Ohhhh, I haven't had supper yet.

15:44.550 --> 15:46.632
So start with dessert!

15:46.680 --> 15:48.807
If Hitler drops a calling card
tonight,

15:48.860 --> 15:52.819
at less you don't go up in smoke
eating mashed potatoes?

15:52.860 --> 15:54.293
Come on.

15:54.340 --> 15:57.070
Lets go.

15:59.610 --> 16:03.478
It's dead simple, I'm not
raising another man's kid!

16:03.520 --> 16:05.863
You can't just evict a baby!

16:05.920 --> 16:08.878
We can't afford two rents,
plus there's Sheila.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.569
Those are your reasons
for staying?

16:10.620 --> 16:13.783
It was a mistake, Bob.
A single stupid...

16:13.840 --> 16:16.616
You tell me _it was
only one time.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.799
I've been so unhappy.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.365
Ah, well you're in for one
hell of a carnival now.

16:22.410 --> 16:24.628
You know what I've
put up With.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.149
It goes both ways!

16:26.200 --> 16:28.896
Maybe if you hadn't shut me
out all those years ago...

16:28.940 --> 16:32.285
You think I don't have
changes to clip my wick?

16:32.330 --> 16:36.767
You think I didn't have
offers I walked away from?

16:36.820 --> 16:41.029
No, Bob. I don't.

16:55.620 --> 16:59.442
We're clone.

17:05.630 --> 17:11.318
Get out of my house.

17:23.860 --> 17:26.511
Well, I sure missed that.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.869
You and me both!

17:28.910 --> 17:30.252
Champagne?

17:30.310 --> 17:31.436
Sure.

17:35.310 --> 17:38.871
What's it like?
Learning secret codes,

17:38.920 --> 17:41.878
night manoeuvres,
hand-to-hand combat.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.353
Your letters, all the
juicy bits cut out,

17:44.410 --> 17:46.093
I can only imagine.

17:46.930 --> 17:48.704
Gladys!

17:48.760 --> 17:49.658
It's not loaded.

17:49.720 --> 17:54.066
Girl with a gun?
I don't like it.

17:54.110 --> 17:55.190
Come here.

17:56.940 --> 17:59.454
It's a piece of art,
in a way.

17:59.510 --> 18:01.546
Never really looked
at one before.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.898
Well the gun pin catches
the detonator here,

18:03.950 --> 18:05.554
the little ring on
the bottom.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.908
Lights the primer, see?

18:06.950 --> 18:09.293
That burns the gunpowder
in the casing,

18:09.340 --> 18:12.901
fires off the shell to
hit its mark. Boom.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.953
A bullet's like a little
bomb, same as we build.

18:18.790 --> 18:21.691
Truth is I need all
the help I can get.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.446
I'm sure you dazzled
them at training.

18:24.490 --> 18:25.878
Hardly.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.740
Oh come now, you
mess up a code?

18:28.800 --> 18:33.669
Did your hand-to-hand
got out of hand?

18:33.720 --> 18:35.847
I hate to disappoint you,

18:39.810 --> 18:41.983
but I almost failed.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.684
But you can't disappoint me,
James.

18:48.730 --> 18:52.427
You're just being hard
on yourself.

18:54.740 --> 18:56.640
You know me too well.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.560
Come on, let's hit the town.

19:01.610 --> 19:02.269
Yeah?

19:02.310 --> 19:06.610
Yeah. But first.

19:13.410 --> 19:16.311
[Laughing]

19:16.370 --> 19:19.533
What? Factory chemicals
wreck my skin.

19:19.590 --> 19:23.765
I bet Ivan appreciates
the effort.

19:23.810 --> 19:26.938
You know, they kept
your room on a weekly.

19:26.990 --> 19:32.769
I could loan you rent till
you're back on your feet.

19:32.820 --> 19:35.721
What else are you
going to do?

19:35.780 --> 19:38.032
There's money stashed
in our Caravan.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.729
I earned most of it.

19:39.780 --> 19:43.216
You don't go back there
alone, promise?

19:43.260 --> 19:44.818
You're a treasure, Betty.

19:44.870 --> 19:47.350
I really do appreciate
everything.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.002
Anyone here seen my wrap?

19:54.060 --> 19:56.187
A truckload of your
luggage came in.

19:56.230 --> 19:59.108
I sent for my things,
Bets, it's what one does.

19:59.150 --> 20:02.881
Ladies. Sorry for
the intrusion.

20:02.940 --> 20:06.717
James is taking me to the late
seating at Club Carousel.

20:06.770 --> 20:09.159
This is where you
want to live?

20:09.200 --> 20:10.804
Yeah, isn't it darling?

20:10.860 --> 20:13.021
I think we need to shop around.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.719
This is hardly a hovel,
twangie boy.

20:15.770 --> 20:18.648
You ask me, it looks
like worse.

20:18.690 --> 20:20.908
James, I'd be snug
as a bug here.

20:20.950 --> 20:23.259
Yeah, except who's
tucking you in?

20:23.300 --> 20:25.302
Maybe we should talk
about this later.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.045
I think that's
a good idea.

20:27.090 --> 20:31.618
Go grab your fox and
go tuck into a rib-eye.

21:35.290 --> 21:39.761
[Gun Fire]

21:39.820 --> 21:41.549
Bloody hell...

21:41.600 --> 21:44.683
James? James!!!

21:44.730 --> 21:48.348
Gladys!

21:48.390 --> 21:49.948
Four tries that took me.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.913
Put it down, James.
You're drunk.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.428
Drunk or sober, I'm
still a rotten shot.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.357
Sure I can hit targets,

21:58.400 --> 22:01.312
but there are no targets
on a battlefield, Gladys,
only men.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.873
You'll learn how.

22:02.930 --> 22:05.398
Theres systems, and armour,
they'll protect you.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.499
Don't you get it?! It's not
the dying I'm afraid of

22:08.540 --> 22:09.882
it's the killing.

22:09.930 --> 22:14.367
That only proves
you're human.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.412
I'm also an officer with
a mISSIOn to carry out

22:17.460 --> 22:19.371
and fifty men to keep safe.

22:19.420 --> 22:23.026
I can't hit a dummy, how
can I protect them from
raving Krauts?

22:23.080 --> 22:24.422
Shooting's not your job.

22:24.470 --> 22:26.370
If the training said
you were ready...

22:26.430 --> 22:27.818
They pass any officer, Gladys,

22:27.860 --> 22:30.294
even the ones they
know aren't ready.

22:30.340 --> 22:34.379
Truth is, bullets meant
be whizzing at my men's
heads in a month

22:34.440 --> 22:37.079
and I've no idea how
to keep them alive.

22:37.130 --> 22:39.041
You can't stand hearing it,
can you?

22:39.090 --> 22:41.354
Your fianc may not
be a war hero?

22:41.400 --> 22:45.177
Of course I can. I love you,
James.

22:54.320 --> 22:58.541
We need some sleep.
I gotta be up for work soon.

22:58.590 --> 23:02.378
You're going to go to work,
my leave ends tomorrow.

23:04.070 --> 23:10.293
I've got a job to do in
this war and so do you.

23:10.340 --> 23:15.607
I enlisted for you, Gladys.
For you.

You're lucky my gun wasn't out.

24:36.470 --> 24:39.382
Detective Sergeant Brodie.

24:39.430 --> 24:41.478
Not keen on visitors,
I see.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.771
You are?

24:42.820 --> 24:44.344
Marion Rowley.

24:44.390 --> 24:45.561
The Reverend's daughter.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.124
Yes, Sir.

24:48.180 --> 24:51.559
Folks on Bond Street told me
he was bunking out this way.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.521
When did you last see him?

24:54.580 --> 24:58.619
Two nights ago. Father went
out to reach the people.

24:58.670 --> 25:01.093
That's what we call it,
street-preaching.

25:01.150 --> 25:03.050
A good man of the Lord.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.759
I'm afraid I have bad news.

25:08.810 --> 25:14.066
We believe your father, well,
seems your father's dead.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.599
Possible foul play.

25:15.640 --> 25:19.986
Oh God... Oh God...

25:20.040 --> 25:23.771
I wonder if you might help
me confirm his identity.

25:23.820 --> 25:25.811
Yes. I'd like to see him.

25:39.490 --> 25:41.094
Got your note.

25:41.140 --> 25:46.624
I didn't want to wake you.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.275
Lorna, what happened?

25:49.330 --> 25:51.548
I'm done fighting.

25:51.590 --> 25:54.639
I'll do what I've helped a
dozen young, stupid girls do.

25:54.680 --> 25:58.320
Work at the factory till I start
showing, then north to Keswick,

25:58.380 --> 26:00.894
they've a home there
for girls in trouble.

26:00.950 --> 26:06.422
I'll have the baby and

26:06.470 --> 26:07.778
put it up for adoption.

26:07.820 --> 26:11.165
No, I'll take the baby,
my family, we...

26:11.220 --> 26:18.308
You can't. It'll ruin us both.

26:18.350 --> 26:23.185
Please understand this;
I've a lot to lose.

26:28.230 --> 26:29.219
Bye Marco.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.638
It's my father.
That's Vernon Rowley.

26:45.030 --> 26:49.114
Two days, why not
report him missing?

26:49.170 --> 26:52.992
He said he might look into a
truck for sale out in Etobicoke.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.951
So you're pratically
the sole heir.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.127
You saw where we live,
we're broke.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.785
You told me your father
was buying a truck,

26:59.830 --> 27:01.912
even the old ones
don't come cheap.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.302
Can you explain it?

27:03.360 --> 27:06.045
Sir, my father has died.

27:06.100 --> 27:08.660
I found out not more
than an hour ago.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.440
I'd ask you to show a little
more consideration.

27:11.490 --> 27:18.714
Of course. Perhaps we can
continue our conversation
at another tIme.

27:18.760 --> 27:22.582
Absolutely. You know
where to find me.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.540
Same place I was before.

27:24.590 --> 27:26.330
Last thing.

27:26.380 --> 27:30.202
The night he died, a
beat cop saw your
father in a nasty scrap

27:30.250 --> 27:31.774
with a young blonde woman.

27:31.820 --> 27:34.596
She vowed that he'd pay
for what he'd done.

27:34.650 --> 27:36.686
Sounds like a clue to me.

27:36.740 --> 27:39.994
Any ideas who she might be?

27:40.040 --> 27:43.658
Yes, a lady from our
revivals up north.

27:43.700 --> 27:46.396
He tried a healing,
she had shingles,

27:46.440 --> 27:48.613
But he only made it worse.

27:48.660 --> 27:56.055
She found my father a few days
ago, argued, it got pretty ugly.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.795
Miss Smith, I think.

27:57.850 --> 28:00.717
Smith?

28:00.760 --> 28:04.025
It might have been Smythe.

28:20.390 --> 28:21.948

28:22.000 --> 28:23.729
They're being hard
on the leadership.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.692
Exactly. I'm sure
they did their best.

28:26.740 --> 28:30.653
Well a lot of men were new, who
knows what training they had?

28:30.700 --> 28:31.871
The officers gave them up.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.399
What were they
supposed to do?

28:33.450 --> 28:35.702
Fight! We keep caving?
We lose this war.

28:35.750 --> 28:38.093
Our soldiers are prisoners now.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.185

on the blower.

the going gets rough.

28:45.810 --> 28:47.198
Well that's your opinion.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.413

responsrble for those men.

be heroes, Gods...

31:41.110 --> 31:42.930
You can count on me.

31:42.980 --> 31:44.060
You'll come back home after?

31:44.110 --> 31:44.929
Go.

31:44.990 --> 31:45.763
Please.

31:45.810 --> 31:47.459
Help, help her.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.394
The bleeding won't stop.

32:10.450 --> 32:11.701
I can't be seen.

32:11.750 --> 32:13.183
She thinks it's a miscarriage.

32:13.230 --> 32:14.219
Mother?

32:14.280 --> 32:15.963
What happened?

32:16.020 --> 32:18.056
A possible miscarriage, a
hemorrhage could indicate
a torn uterus.

32:18.110 --> 32:19.623
We'll get her prepped
for a transfusion.

32:19.670 --> 32:22.321
I've done things
I shouldn't...

32:22.370 --> 32:24.804
Everythings going to be
alright; won't it?

32:24.850 --> 32:29.935
Please, Sheila.
Let's do our job.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.675
Your mother knows
how to fight.

32:57.450 --> 33:00.533
Nice day.

33:00.580 --> 33:04.186
It's bloody freezing.

33:04.240 --> 33:09.018
Can't disagree
with you there.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.379
How 'bout I buy
you dinner?

33:11.420 --> 33:13.320
You don't want to
eat with me.

33:13.380 --> 33:17.760
Hey, I'm a half-civilized
fellow here.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.903
Plenty other girls around.

33:27.740 --> 33:28.991
You like steak?

33:29.050 --> 33:32.178
I could murder a T-bone.

33:34.620 --> 33:37.305
I'm Randall.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.749
Vera.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.792
That's a pretty name.

33:49.590 --> 33:53.060
Your prince stormed the
castle, slayed the dragon

33:53.110 --> 33:57.069
or at least snuck past
snoring Mrs. Groot.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.112
Trust me, that old bat
misses plenty.

34:00.160 --> 34:04.779
I... thought you might
be ignoring me.

34:04.820 --> 34:12.568
No, no, it's just... was a
busy day at work today...

34:12.610 --> 34:16.046
and my best friend,

34:16.090 --> 34:17.785
she went and left town.

34:17.830 --> 34:20.788
Sorry to hear that,
she seemed real nice.

34:23.620 --> 34:26.407
Sorry I wrecked your
plans the other night.

34:29.930 --> 34:35.937
Just wanted to
treat you rIght.

34:41.250 --> 34:44.720
I'd bet you never
been properly kissed.

34:44.770 --> 34:48.206
No. No I never have.

34:48.260 --> 34:52.162
Well here goes.

35:01.620 --> 35:03.702
Thank you.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.154
Destroyer, that's
what you are.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.418
You think so.

35:26.470 --> 35:31.464
Best night of my life and
it's not even nine o'clock!

35:31.520 --> 35:33.169
Shush, you'll get
us in trouble.

35:33.210 --> 35:36.259
Hell, I'm knee-deep
in it now, Sugar!

35:36.300 --> 35:38.256
God I love this war!

35:38.310 --> 35:40.699
Meeting a rare dish like you?

35:57.540 --> 36:03.627
I could die now on my first
sortie and I wouldn't care.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.241
Get my pants.

36:08.290 --> 36:09.985
I'm not putting them on.

36:10.030 --> 36:13.295
Something in the pocket.
Go on.

36:21.870 --> 36:22.564
Mints?

36:22.610 --> 36:25.124
Oh shoot. Not those.

36:33.140 --> 36:36.439
Real silk. Don't worry,
they're new.

36:40.670 --> 36:46.586
The guys told me that's
what you all like.

36:46.630 --> 36:50.589
Did I hurt your feelings?

36:55.560 --> 36:57.289
They're glorious.

37:01.340 --> 37:04.218
My soldier.

37:19.710 --> 37:23.885
They moved her to room 235.

37:23.930 --> 37:25.534
You can see her now.

37:25.590 --> 37:27.273
Working up to it.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.899
She wanted to tell you,

37:31.940 --> 37:34.329
I think she was afraid
you'd make her quit.

37:34.380 --> 37:39.465
Don't you worry. It's fine.

37:39.510 --> 37:43.514
I really appreciate you
helping me get down here.

37:43.560 --> 37:46.381
You're a good friend Edith.

37:46.430 --> 37:49.342
Except we won't be
crossing paths much.

37:49.390 --> 37:52.951
I'm moving lines.
Fifty-pounders now.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.560
Yeah I read about those.
Dead rislq.

37:55.620 --> 37:58.874
A_nd makes an extra
eight cents an hour.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.445
Since I'm the one, puts food
on the table.

38:01.490 --> 38:03.355
Can't be easy.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.366
I'm looking for
Lorna Corbett.

38:05.410 --> 38:07.366
Marco?

38:07.410 --> 38:09.275
Edith. Where is she?

38:09.330 --> 38:11.230
Recovering. She's all right.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.362
Betty told me she'd
gone home ill,

38:13.420 --> 38:14.580
but when there was no
answer at home...

38:14.640 --> 38:16.153
You were at our home?

38:16.200 --> 38:20.330
Marco, this is Lorna's
husband Bob.

38:20.380 --> 38:27.559
Yeah, got her address
from the office.

38:27.600 --> 38:33.209
Give Lorna my love. And save
a bit for yourself.

38:38.050 --> 38:38.869
Goodnight Marco.

38:42.010 --> 38:47.926
Sit down.

39:05.510 --> 39:10.379
Lorna, she's a strong
woman. From what I know,

39:13.350 --> 39:16.080
You stay away from my wife.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.064
Well look who's here.

39:49.990 --> 39:54.199
I was out there thinking
that I had no family left,

39:54.260 --> 39:58.378
but then I realized that I did.

40:18.410 --> 40:23.109
You know I'm
leavmg tomorrow.

40:23.150 --> 40:27.246
It was a long day.

40:27.290 --> 40:30.066
I can't blame you
for avoiding me.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.156
I wanted this visit
to be perfect,

40:32.210 --> 40:35.429
give us enough juice for
God knows how long.

40:35.470 --> 40:37.518
You'll be back home soon.

40:37.560 --> 40:42.429
Not if our side keeps losing
battles like we did yesterday.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.828
I've been thinking, James,

40:47.880 --> 40:52.783
and the fact is,
you're no coward.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.489
Look at me.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.758
There's no officer
camp In the world,

40:59.800 --> 41:02.405
can make a man ready
for his first battle.

41:02.460 --> 41:07.978
It's life that prepares us.

41:08.030 --> 41:15.459
And I know you've
lived yours well.

41:18.860 --> 41:21.511
Stand over there.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.382
Go on, we don't have all night.

41:26.960 --> 41:31.215
Now, show me what you've got.

41:31.270 --> 41:33.568
I've set you up
here at the hotel.

41:33.620 --> 41:36.521
I can't afford this.
Not on my salary.

41:36.580 --> 41:39.617
I'm paying. It's done, Gladys,

41:39.670 --> 41:42.537
and I think it's rather
a decent compromise.

41:42.580 --> 41:45.185
So you're telling me
what to do, are you?

41:45.240 --> 41:46.491
Damn right I am.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.147
That's my man.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.067
There now you'll have a
photo to remember me by.

41:53.110 --> 41:56.728
I'll be sending you a copy too,
so you don't forget either.

41:56.770 --> 41:59.557
I'd rather have
one of you dear.

42:08.870 --> 42:15.048
Don't give up, James.
Don't you dare give up.

42:28.410 --> 42:30.628
You've got quite the
glow this morning.

42:30.670 --> 42:34.197
Well, last night I had some
fresh air, a good dinner,

42:34.240 --> 42:35.719
met a friendly face.

42:35.770 --> 42:37.761
Why Vera Burr,

42:37.810 --> 42:41.462
did you go and snag yourself
the love of a good man?

42:41.510 --> 42:44.377
I may have taken a
stroll with a gent.

42:44.430 --> 42:47.900
You'd like him, the
perfect soldier.

42:52.300 --> 43:02.266
You got that right.
