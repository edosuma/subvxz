WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.925
It's not always fun
to be chosen.

00:07.967 --> 00:11.804
To be thrust upon by greatness.

00:11.846 --> 00:14.724
What you love most may get
crushed to a fine talcum

00:14.765 --> 00:17.184
under the heavy footfalls
of the inevitable.

00:23.482 --> 00:28.487
The call of that sweet lioness
we name Destiny

00:28.529 --> 00:31.115
doesn't just bring
the good guys onto the field.

00:31.157 --> 00:32.908
Oh, no.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.745
Villainy gets a turn at bat.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.998
And it plays
only the hardest of balls.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.308
-I got nothing. -Shit.
Lint's gonna have our asses

00:57.349 --> 00:58.976
if we don't find her.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.854
The ones with skin in this game

01:01.896 --> 01:04.273
may have to sacrifice it all
for the team.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.442
But you can't
give up now, hero.

01:06.484 --> 01:10.362
The town you call Home Plate
lies in the path of a Goliath.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.073
What are you gonna do about it?

01:13.115 --> 01:14.909
What are you gonna do?

01:14.950 --> 01:17.495
Hey, I got a bucket, in case
you're gonna throw up more.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.497
Oh, boy. Okay, Superian.

01:19.538 --> 01:22.333
-No, I'm good.
-Doctor,

01:22.374 --> 01:23.751
how is Tick
making Superian sick?

01:23.793 --> 01:25.503
When The Tick blew up the wharf,

01:25.544 --> 01:28.047
he was covered in tiny
smithereens of Big Bismuth.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.299
All this time, Superian
has been woefully exposed

01:30.341 --> 01:32.051
to his weakness.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.719
Superian's condition
is improving now that

01:33.761 --> 01:36.222
The Tick is away, but we are not
out of the forest yet.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.474
Doctor, we need to get him
back out there

01:38.516 --> 01:40.601
-so he can stop the V-L-M.
-No!

01:40.643 --> 01:43.062
Superian must stay away from
that walking Big Bismuth farm.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.272
We cannot let The Terror's plan
fall into place.

01:45.314 --> 01:49.527
Okay, color is doing
some weird things right now.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.529
-What is The Terror's plan?
-To use the Big Bismuth

01:51.570 --> 01:55.074
in the V-L-M's bloodstream as
the payload for the explosion,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.659
which will kill Superian.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.702
-Have you not been listening?
-Yeah, no, I-I get...

01:58.744 --> 02:01.497
I get the whole
bloodstream-Bismuth thing,

02:01.539 --> 02:03.082
kind of-- I just,
I don't understand

02:03.123 --> 02:05.209
how The Terror
is gonna blow up the V-L-M.

02:05.251 --> 02:07.211
The wingsuit
you stole back from him,

02:07.253 --> 02:10.214
he had me modify it, adding
to it an ingenious device,

02:10.256 --> 02:13.050
which will detonate the V-L-M
from a short distance away.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.386
Wait, but then why did he
let me escape with it?

02:15.427 --> 02:17.429
I believe
The Terror intends for you

02:17.471 --> 02:18.806
to trigger the explosion.

02:18.848 --> 02:20.975
-That's insane.
-Very likely so.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.061
But we may be able to use
that insanity to our advantage.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.437
Wha-What are you talking about?

02:25.479 --> 02:27.606
I must begin working
on the wingsuit immediately.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.608
Okay, am I flying right now?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.110
-No.
-I feel very up.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.529
-You're standing.
-Got it.

02:33.571 --> 02:35.239
We should get you back into bed.

02:35.281 --> 02:36.448
-Okay.
-

02:36.490 --> 02:37.700
Hello?

02:37.741 --> 02:38.826
Hello?

02:38.868 --> 02:40.661
Goat.

02:40.703 --> 02:43.497
-Hey. Uh, can I, uh, help you?
-One night.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.082
I take off early for one night,

02:45.124 --> 02:47.459
and my grandmother gives
The Tickman all of our ice.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.838
-Okay, I can pay you...
-Who needs $120 worth of ice?

02:50.880 --> 02:54.008
Uh, look, Goat,
I'm-I'm actually dealing

02:54.049 --> 02:57.261
-with a semi-sensitive
situation. -Sensitive?

02:57.303 --> 03:01.015
It must be very inflamed
if you need that much ice.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.101
-Oh! Oh, my God!
-Goat, that's not...

03:04.143 --> 03:06.770
Ah...

03:36.842 --> 03:39.678
Even now the champions gather,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.805
pooling their might,

03:41.847 --> 03:43.807
facing dawn's grim test

03:43.849 --> 03:46.060
-with grit and...
-

03:46.101 --> 03:47.227
Inseam!

03:48.854 --> 03:52.650
Sorry. Dr. Karamazov insists
that we try and rescue

03:52.691 --> 03:55.152
every crystal
of Big Bismuth that we can.

03:55.194 --> 03:58.656
I understand.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.075
And if that's what it takes,

04:01.116 --> 04:06.288
then I want you to get way up
in my Bismuth, Kevin.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.167
That's it.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.294
Oh, my God.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.421
-It's Superian!
-Yes, yes, it's Superian.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.006
He's just trying
to recuperate here quietly,

04:16.048 --> 04:18.092
so if you could--
wha-what are you doing?

04:18.133 --> 04:19.468
My friend Carl will not believe

04:19.510 --> 04:21.053
I'm in the same apartment
as Superian.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.596
Stop it. No pictures.
This is serious business.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.223
He's in trouble.
And as long as

04:24.264 --> 04:26.016
he's in trouble,
we're all in trouble.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.559
Everybody--
the city, the entire world.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.603
So until he gets better,

04:29.645 --> 04:31.605
not a word about him
being here to anyone.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.983
Okay. All right.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.401
Arthur.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.319
I think I have a plan,
but we must go back

04:37.361 --> 04:40.239
to Tinfoil Kevin's
robot head at once!

04:40.280 --> 04:42.241
Do you need my help?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.743
Yeah.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.745
Well, that was intimate.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.247
That was...

04:48.288 --> 04:51.667
every... inch of you.

04:51.709 --> 04:54.169
Now, we see

04:54.211 --> 04:56.213
how much Bismuth we got.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.799
Whoa. Robbed of a sparkle

04:58.841 --> 05:01.552
-I never knew I had. -Doctor,
let me get this straight.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.762
The Terror told you to put
that thing inside my suit?

05:03.804 --> 05:06.098
Inside my suit, yes.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.100
-The Catalyzer.
-And that Catalyzer thing

05:08.142 --> 05:11.270
is supposed to somehow detonate
the Bismuth inside the V-L-M?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.272
The Terror sets off
the device remotely,

05:13.313 --> 05:15.315
which then triggers
the V-L-M to explode

05:15.357 --> 05:17.609
into a cloud
of radiated Bismuth.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.195
And this kills Superian.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.449
Okay.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.493
But you think that you can alter
the Catalyzer thing.

05:26.535 --> 05:29.038
-Yes.
-So instead of... exploding,

05:29.079 --> 05:31.874
it just shrinks the V-L-M
back down to normal size?

05:31.915 --> 05:35.377
-Yes, I do.
-Snazzy. How about we do that?

05:38.464 --> 05:40.466
So, Esteban,

05:40.507 --> 05:43.093
been in town for a whole week

05:43.135 --> 05:46.555
killing Pyramid gang members,
stepping on The Terror's plans,

05:46.597 --> 05:50.142
teaming up with the JV league
of idiot superheroes.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.145
Is this the torture?

05:53.187 --> 05:55.773
'Cause you're
boring me to death.

05:55.814 --> 05:59.818
There's just one thing
I don't understand.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.115
You're in town for a whole week,
and you don't call?

06:05.157 --> 06:07.826
- -Don't you even care anymore?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.703
Don't I even warrant just...

06:09.745 --> 06:11.288
a little vendetta?

06:11.330 --> 06:13.665
I stalked you a little.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.919
-Really? -Hoped you'd
lead me to The Terror,

06:16.960 --> 06:20.297
till I realized you had no idea
he was still alive.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.716
That's not the only reason
you were watching me, is it,

06:22.758 --> 06:23.842
little Straight Shooter?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.344
Straight Shooter's dead.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.596
I don't think so.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.059
I think he's still in you.

06:34.019 --> 06:37.314
We had something special,
he and I.

06:37.356 --> 06:40.526
You used me so The Terror
could steal the access codes

06:40.567 --> 06:42.402
to Flag Five Headquarters.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.904
You took advantage of me.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.323
Villain.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.617
Oh, come on.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.578
You loved it.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.167
Can we just cut the crap
and get to the torture?

06:57.209 --> 06:59.253
Okay.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.812
Authorities report
the V-L-M is still heading

07:16.854 --> 07:18.856
in an easterly direction toward,

07:18.897 --> 07:21.108
quote, "more populated areas."

07:21.150 --> 07:24.111
-The mayor has issued a
statement urging calm... -Ouma.

07:24.153 --> 07:25.320
-Hey.
-...and says that she has

07:25.362 --> 07:27.156
complete faith
in the U.S. military

07:27.197 --> 07:29.116
-and Superian.
-What's he doing in there?

07:29.158 --> 07:32.953
Sleeping.
Goat is with him.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.371
I'll take over for a little bit.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.039
No loss of life yet,

07:36.081 --> 07:37.332
but authorities estimate
property damage to be

07:37.374 --> 07:38.750
-in the millions.
-We'll figure all of this out.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.169
You don't have to worry.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.379
It seems like
a good time for worry.

07:42.421 --> 07:46.258
Well... yeah.

07:49.887 --> 07:53.056
I tell my grandson
to be more like you.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.558
What?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.059
You're willing to
throw your life away

07:56.101 --> 07:57.603
to help others.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.897
But, that's, uh...

07:59.938 --> 08:02.983
Tha-That's really bad advice.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.659
So, the drumming...

08:12.701 --> 08:14.620
this a good thing
for the boss?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.121
I mean, mood-wise?

08:17.539 --> 08:20.792
'Cause I have to say
the feeling isn't...

08:20.834 --> 08:23.587
"good," per se.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.173
Stop it!

08:35.307 --> 08:37.476
Can you not hear it?

08:37.517 --> 08:41.104
It's like two notes
stepping all over each other.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.105
Sorry, sir, how's that?

08:42.147 --> 08:44.441
Nah. What is it?

08:46.485 --> 08:48.612
What's missing?

08:48.654 --> 08:50.614
And in related news,

08:50.656 --> 08:52.032
where is Superian?

08:52.074 --> 08:53.909
That's a question many people

08:53.951 --> 08:55.327
are beginning to ask.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.412
Go check on the Urmanians.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.207
See if they've got that
little shrimp on ice yet.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.459
No.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.169
Oh, that little...

09:04.211 --> 09:05.796
We are ready, uh,
to shoot your announcement.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.465
-Okay, we can table that.
-

09:08.507 --> 09:12.678
Arthur Everest.
Little pissant.

09:12.719 --> 09:16.098
I want Mothboy's family tree
up on the board.

09:16.139 --> 09:20.102
I want to know who and where
all of them are.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.229
-Now!
-

09:31.071 --> 09:33.031
Lint's not letting anyone

09:33.073 --> 09:34.658
Yeah, well,

09:34.700 --> 09:36.994
who the fuck wants to be
in her torture chamber anyway?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.329
I almost feel sorry
for Overkill.

09:39.371 --> 09:43.083
-Know what I mean?
-Yeah, yeah.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.517
I'm in pain.

10:00.559 --> 10:04.730
Hey. Good, you're up.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.606
Okay.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.234
Superian...

10:10.694 --> 10:12.738
...The Terror is alive.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.700
Where am I again?

10:16.742 --> 10:19.745
Uh, this is my apartment.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.539
You're suffering from
Big Bismuth poisoning.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.083
Big what poisoning?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.669
Big Bismuth. Uh,

10:27.711 --> 10:29.713
The Terror figured out
that it's your weakness.

10:29.755 --> 10:33.091
And he figured out a way to make
you more than just sick from it.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.844
Oh, right, that stuff.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.805
I always hated it.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.224
You knew about it?
How did...

10:41.266 --> 10:42.559
Where does it come from?

10:42.601 --> 10:46.396
Mm... baggage.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.648
Wait.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.150
The Terror is alive?

10:50.192 --> 10:51.318
Yes.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.695
Huh. I wondered about that.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.156
I'm sorry, you...
you wondered?

10:56.198 --> 10:57.908
We found his teeth...

10:57.949 --> 11:00.369
Yeah, I know about the teeth.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.662
What is it with you people
and teeth?

11:02.704 --> 11:04.748
I thought I had him.

11:04.790 --> 11:07.000
Spider tank...

11:07.042 --> 11:10.295
...it blew up,
and I just wanted it to be over.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.714
And everyone was just tired
of him getting away with it

11:12.756 --> 11:14.174
all the time.

11:14.216 --> 11:16.343
When it looked like I finally...

11:16.385 --> 11:19.346
had him, well...

11:19.388 --> 11:21.765
I thought they
liked me before, but...

11:21.807 --> 11:23.934
the adulation

11:23.975 --> 11:27.145
was remarkable.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.481
-Yeah, well...
-I should've made sure.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.443
Guess I was afraid
of what I might find.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.451
Why do you help us?

11:45.038 --> 11:48.166
Because I want to be
a good person.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.548
Arthur, Kevin said
the doctor needs to see you

11:54.589 --> 11:56.049
back at the head.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.802
Okay, yeah.

11:58.844 --> 12:00.011
Albert.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.763
It's Arthur.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.307
The secret to
The Terror's plans...

12:04.349 --> 12:07.018
they make no sense.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.607
Dr. Karamazov.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.859
Ah, Arthur!

12:13.900 --> 12:15.318
Hey.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.571
I finished
modifying the Catalyzer.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.157
All we have to do is get
this device within 100 feet

12:20.198 --> 12:22.701
of the V-L-M's brain
and trigger the reaction.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.162
A-And that will shrink him
back down to normal size?

12:25.203 --> 12:28.248
Absolutely. No question.
In theory.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.000
Uh, theory?

12:30.041 --> 12:32.711
Well, science is not
an exact science.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.796
There are no real absolutes.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.590
The outcomes,
especially with Big Bismuth,

12:36.631 --> 12:38.216
can be unpredictable.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.094
Unpredictable. So, like,
wh-what could happen instead?

12:43.972 --> 12:44.973
Oh!

12:45.015 --> 12:48.685
Big Bismuth
and the V-L-M detonates.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.729
So, what are the chances
of that happening?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.439
20% chance.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.649
-20% chance that I die.
-Sorry.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.776
20% chance of success.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.029
80% chance
of everyone exploding.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.827
Wait a minute.
Arthur exploding?

13:05.869 --> 13:07.704
I think I got to do this, Tick.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.289
I'll do it.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.917
I can explode
and barely feel a thing.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.210
I even enjoy it.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.836
Tick, come on,
it won't fit you.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.963
Okay?

13:17.005 --> 13:20.133
Like you said
back at my apartment...

13:21.843 --> 13:24.346
...it's perfectly sized
for my tiny body.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.142
- -All right,

13:29.184 --> 13:30.727
I disengaged The Terror's
remote trigger.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.687
Now, only you control
the Catalyzer.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.439
Copy that.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.318
Let me see.
I can read this now.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.237
I switched it to English.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.156
Hand Taser?

13:43.198 --> 13:45.367
I got hand Tasers?

13:46.910 --> 13:49.204
That's cool.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.956
- -

13:52.290 --> 13:56.253
I got to say...
you look good, Esteban.

13:56.294 --> 13:59.881
Yeah, AEGIS did a nice job
rebuilding you.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.342
New face, new eyes,

14:02.384 --> 14:04.928
those talented hands.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.557
Okay, I get it.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.267
You don't find me
attractive anymore.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.769
- -What is it?

14:12.811 --> 14:15.981
The crazy glass eye
or the giant scar down my face?

14:16.022 --> 14:19.734
I'm not one to talk about
anyone's eyes and scars.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.653
Okay?

14:21.695 --> 14:24.114
I think you're more beautiful
now than ever.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.826
Doesn't change the fact

14:27.867 --> 14:29.995
that you're back
working for him.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.871
What choice do I have?

14:31.913 --> 14:33.582
I know you, Janet.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.166
I saw there was good in you.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.128
It wasn't the good in me
that you were attracted to.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.548
It doesn't matter.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.174
Only thing that matters to me

14:43.216 --> 14:45.885
is seeing The Terror's head
cleaved in two.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.723
What if I can make that happen?

14:52.017 --> 14:55.395
Things haven't been great
between us lately.

14:55.437 --> 14:58.148
I have the means at my disposal.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.774
I run the city now.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.818
The Terror runs the city.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.320
And he runs you.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.947
Not if you kill him.

15:05.989 --> 15:09.868
Consider it a win-win
for both of us.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.370
I'll even tell you
where he's at.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.292
Holed up
in the BTC building downtown.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.587
As in... Brown Tingle Cola?

15:20.629 --> 15:23.506
He created that stuff
back in the day.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.758
Damn it.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.885
It's my favorite kind of cola.

15:26.926 --> 15:31.222
I would kill him myself,
but he's... kind of my mentor.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.477
No, thanks. Not interested.

15:35.518 --> 15:36.978
I am offering you the chance

15:37.020 --> 15:39.898
to kill the man
that murdered your team.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.399
Your Uncle Samson.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.778
No offense, Janet,
but I don't trust you.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.405
Yeah.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.326
Okay, I get it.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.663
So should we just pick up
where we left off?

15:54.704 --> 15:55.747
It's your party.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.131
How does that feel, baby?

16:05.173 --> 16:07.342
That all you got?

16:07.384 --> 16:08.677
You want more?

16:08.718 --> 16:10.970
-I got more.
-Give me more.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.431
- -Oh, Jesus.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.141
Come on!

16:22.273 --> 16:25.777
Some 15 years ago,
when we were all younger,

16:25.819 --> 16:27.779
more innocent,
and unaware of how quickly

16:27.821 --> 16:29.280
everything could change forever,

16:29.322 --> 16:31.282
- -this city was defended

16:31.324 --> 16:33.159
by a patriotic team of heroes.

16:33.201 --> 16:36.037
-Hello

16:36.079 --> 16:37.914
-Can I talk to her, please?
-Oh, Arthur!

16:37.956 --> 16:39.249
I was just thinking about you.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.834
-Funny story... -Oh, Walter,
come on, please don't.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.836
When we got up this morning,
there was no yogurt

16:42.877 --> 16:45.714
in the fridge,
so we thought, "croissants."

16:45.755 --> 16:47.757
That's a fun word to say,
isn't it? "Croissants."

16:47.799 --> 16:49.050
I also like pamplemousse.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.760
That's a "grapefruit" in French.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.721
Yeah, Walter, my mother

16:52.762 --> 16:53.972
Ah, that's what I'm telling you.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.598
She went to get us
something to eat,

16:55.640 --> 16:58.184
while I save our place
at the memorial ceremony.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.686
The memorial ceremony?

16:59.728 --> 17:01.938
Yeah, the Flag Five Memorial
ceremony.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.773
Your mother knew
you wouldn't want to come,

17:03.815 --> 17:05.608
and, of course, that's okay.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.613
Providing
protection... -Y-You there?

17:10.655 --> 17:12.574
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm still here.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.159
I-I just, uh...

17:14.200 --> 17:17.787
I forgot that, uh,
today is that day.

17:17.829 --> 17:21.166
Well, that's a first, isn't it?

17:21.207 --> 17:22.709
Wait a second, Walter,

17:22.751 --> 17:25.128
did you say that you're
in the city with Mom?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.172
Tick, Mom and Walter
are in the city.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.966
Heavens to Betsy. More stakes!

17:30.008 --> 17:31.634
Okay, Walter,
listen to me carefully.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.678
-The V-L-M is heading your way.
-What?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.346
The V-L-M is heading
to the city!

17:35.388 --> 17:37.515
-The V-L-M -Yes, yes,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.225
I'm sure, okay?
So you and Mom

17:39.267 --> 17:41.936
have to find shelter,
get yourself to safety now!

17:41.978 --> 17:43.813
Oh, my God.
What are you gonna do?

17:43.855 --> 17:45.315
Tick and I are gonna stop him.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.692
Well, that sounds like
a big day.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.195
Yeah. Yeah,
it's a pretty big day.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.655
So I got to go, Walter.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.449
Good luck, son.

17:54.491 --> 17:57.076
We in the Flag Five
all had one thing in common.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.662
We loved this city
and all the people in it.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.498
I know Chris and Sedona

18:01.539 --> 18:04.083
-and Uncle Samson would be...
-

18:07.170 --> 18:09.297
Yes, I-I think we're...
we're getting word

18:09.339 --> 18:11.090
that there's a citywide alert.

18:11.132 --> 18:14.177
Authorities are asking
that we clear this park and find

18:14.219 --> 18:16.429
the nearest available shelter.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.014
- -Walter!

18:18.056 --> 18:19.557
There you are. What's going on?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.768
Arthur says that the V-L-M
is coming here now.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.895
What

18:23.937 --> 18:27.190
Joan, there's something
you need to know about your son.

18:30.860 --> 18:35.448
As much as I'd really love
to do this all day and night,

18:35.490 --> 18:37.575
I've got things to do,
so unless you've had

18:37.617 --> 18:39.869
a "come to Jesus" moment

18:39.911 --> 18:41.871
about joining me,
there's nothing left to do

18:41.913 --> 18:43.081
but to finish you off.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.918
I get that.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.547
Mmm.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.593
What... what?!

18:55.635 --> 18:57.011
Don't move!

18:57.053 --> 18:58.513
Get away from him!

18:58.555 --> 19:01.057
Clever. Set off
the station's sprinkler system,

19:01.099 --> 19:03.977
so I can't fry you
without frying myself.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.479
That's right.
So back off, Paloma.

19:06.521 --> 19:09.440
You know this isn't over,
right, Dottie?

19:14.279 --> 19:16.114
But first,
I really just want to say

19:16.155 --> 19:17.824
that whatever this is
between you two,

19:17.866 --> 19:20.743
it's not healthy, and you both,
you need serious therapy.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.663
Yeah. You're right.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.749
And not couple's therapy;
serious, one-on-one therapy.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.001
Okay, we get it.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.301
Thanks, Antonio.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.594
Ugh.

19:49.063 --> 19:52.734
Hey, Arthur, uh, I don't know
how to say this.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.694
-I don't want you to go.
-

19:54.736 --> 19:56.321
Tick, the Flag Five Memorial
is today.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.364
Everything is happening today

19:58.406 --> 20:00.742
on-on the anniversary
of my father's death.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.201
I'm starting to think that...

20:02.243 --> 20:04.078
maybe this is all happening
for a reason.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.788
- -Maybe this all means something.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.665
I guess what
I'm saying is that...

20:07.707 --> 20:09.083
maybe I believe you.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.920
Maybe destiny is real.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.923
Oh, she's real, chum.
She's real.

20:14.964 --> 20:18.301
- -Maybe she, she wants me to go.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.636
Up there.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.306
Maybe she wants you to let me.

20:26.392 --> 20:30.063
Vaya con destiny, amigo.

20:30.104 --> 20:33.274
You, too, Tick.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.443
Think you can get him
to stop for a minute?

20:35.485 --> 20:38.112
Yeah, sure, I can do that.
