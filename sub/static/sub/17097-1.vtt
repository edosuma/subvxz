WEBVTT

00:26.862 --> 00:31.867
Give me that old time religion

00:33.869 --> 00:38.874
Give me that old time religion

00:40.375 --> 00:45.380
Give me that old time religion

00:45.881 --> 00:50.385
It's good enough for me

00:53.889 --> 00:58.393
Give me that old time religion

00:59.895 --> 01:04.900
Give me that old time religion

01:04.900 --> 01:10.405
Give me that old time religion

01:10.405 --> 01:15.410
It's good enough for me

01:17.913 --> 01:22.284
It was good for little David

01:22.284 --> 01:26.788
It was good for little David

01:27.289 --> 01:31.793
It was good for little David

01:31.793 --> 01:35.797
and it's good enough for me

01:36.298 --> 01:41.436
Oh, give me that old time religion

01:41.436 --> 01:45.941
Give me that old time religion

01:45.941 --> 01:51.446
Give me that old time religion

01:51.446 --> 01:56.451
It's good enough for me

01:56.952 --> 02:01.573
It was good for old Jonah

02:01.573 --> 02:06.078
It was good for old Jonah

02:06.078 --> 02:10.582
It was good for old Jonah

02:11.083 --> 02:15.587
and it's good enough for me

02:15.587 --> 02:20.092
It was good for the Hebrew children

02:20.592 --> 02:25.097
It was good for the Hebrew children

02:25.097 --> 02:29.601
It was good for the Hebrew children

02:30.102 --> 02:36.108
and it's good enough for me

02:36.108 --> 02:40.862
Give me that old time religion

02:40.862 --> 02:45.367
Give me that old time religion

02:45.367 --> 02:50.372
Give me that old time religion

02:50.872 --> 02:55.877
It's good enough for me

03:05.771 --> 03:07.773
Uh, Good morning, young ladies and gentlemen.

03:07.773 --> 03:09.274
[Door opening]

03:14.780 --> 03:15.781
Good morning, visitors.

03:24.790 --> 03:27.793
For our science lesson for today,

03:27.793 --> 03:31.797
We will continue our discussion of Darwin's theory

03:31.797 --> 03:33.799
of the descent of man.

03:35.300 --> 03:36.301
Now, as I told you yesterday,

03:36.301 --> 03:37.803
Darwin's theory tells us

03:37.803 --> 03:40.806
that man evolved from a lower order of animals,

03:41.306 --> 03:44.309
from the first wiggly protozoa here in the sea

03:44.309 --> 03:48.814
to the ape and finally to man.

03:48.814 --> 03:50.932
Say now some of you fellas out there are probably going to

03:50.932 --> 03:52.934
that's why some of us act like monkeys.

03:52.934 --> 03:54.436
[Laughing]

03:54.436 --> 03:56.438
But what Mr. Charles Darwin
was trying to tell us,

03:56.438 --> 03:57.939
in his own way--

03:57.939 --> 03:59.441
Bertram T. Cates

04:00.442 --> 04:01.443
come off it, Sam.

04:01.443 --> 04:03.445
You've known me all my life.

04:03.445 --> 04:06.448
Bert, you're charged

04:06.948 --> 04:09.451
with violation of public act 31428,

04:09.451 --> 04:12.954
volume 37, statute no. 31428 of the state code,

04:12.954 --> 04:14.456
which makes it unlawful

04:14.456 --> 04:15.957
for any teacher of the public schools

04:15.957 --> 04:17.959
to teach any theory that denies the creation of man

04:17.959 --> 04:19.461
as taught in the bible,

04:19.461 --> 04:21.963
and to teach instead that man has descended

04:21.963 --> 04:24.966
from the lower order of animals.

04:24.966 --> 04:28.470
Bertram Cates, I hereby place you under arrest.

04:39.731 --> 04:41.233
Monkey trial!

04:41.233 --> 04:42.234
Here's another one--

04:42.234 --> 04:44.736
"Monkey shines in Hillsboro."

04:44.736 --> 04:46.738
The whole world's laughing at us.

04:47.239 --> 04:48.240
Look, from Chicago--

04:48.740 --> 04:49.741
"Heavenly Hillsboro--

04:50.242 --> 04:51.743
"does it have a hole in its head."

04:51.743 --> 04:53.245
"or its head in a hole"

04:53.745 --> 04:55.747
I'm telling you, we've gone too far.

04:55.747 --> 04:57.249
Let 'em laugh.

04:57.249 --> 04:58.750
we're fightin' the lord's battle, ain't we, Reverend.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.253
Well, I'd a sight rather have some
heathen a-laughin' at me

05:01.253 --> 05:03.255
than to have my sons a-laughin' at my bible.

05:03.755 --> 05:05.257
Well, they mocked the lord, too, didn't they

05:05.257 --> 05:06.758
and they smote him and they spat upon him,

05:06.758 --> 05:08.260
and he turned to them his other cheek.

05:08.260 --> 05:09.261
Amen.

05:09.761 --> 05:11.763
Look, Reverend, we don't want to smite 'em back.

05:11.763 --> 05:13.765
We just want to make 'em stop.

05:13.765 --> 05:14.766
Tom, you're prosecuting attorney.

05:15.267 --> 05:16.268
Isn't there something we can do?

05:16.268 --> 05:18.270
Well, in view of my position,

05:18.270 --> 05:20.772
I...hardly think it ethical for me
to express my opinion

05:20.772 --> 05:22.274
then you'd better go back to law school.

05:22.774 --> 05:23.775
Gentlemen, I ask you--

05:24.276 --> 05:26.778
what do we care what a bunch of foreigners and city slickers think

05:26.778 --> 05:29.281
Frank, you ever had a frenchman stayin' at your hotel

05:29.281 --> 05:30.282
Now look, you're missing the--

05:30.282 --> 05:32.284
and how long since you sold a pound of grits

05:32.284 --> 05:33.785
to some smart aleck from New York

05:33.785 --> 05:35.787
Heaven has chosen us to show the way,

05:35.787 --> 05:36.788
to light the road for others,

05:37.289 --> 05:39.791
back to the shepherd, back to the fold.

05:39.791 --> 05:41.293
We're not sheep, Reverend.

05:41.293 --> 05:43.795
Well, I'd a sight rather be a sheep than a Judas goat.

05:43.795 --> 05:45.797
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

05:46.798 --> 05:48.300
As mayor of Hillsboro,

05:48.300 --> 05:49.801
I stand to uphold the laws of this community,

05:50.302 --> 05:52.804
No Matter how it may affect my political future.

05:52.804 --> 05:55.307
Now, I shall just ignore these-- these slanders

05:55.307 --> 05:57.309
just like water off a duck's back.

05:57.309 --> 05:59.811
Now look, you only got 2 months more to go as mayor anyway,

05:59.811 --> 06:02.314
and you shouldn't have been elected in the first place.

06:02.314 --> 06:03.815
You've been a lousy mayor.

06:03.815 --> 06:05.817
[Everyone talking at once]

06:06.818 --> 06:07.819
My friends,

06:09.321 --> 06:11.323
as you all know, I deal with figures--

06:11.323 --> 06:13.825
accounts, checks, balances.

06:13.825 --> 06:16.828
My bank operates on the principle of practical reality

06:16.828 --> 06:18.330
and so do I.

06:18.330 --> 06:19.831
Are you aware, my friends,

06:19.831 --> 06:22.334
that the great big universities throughout the country

06:22.834 --> 06:25.337
will consider student applicants from our state

06:25.337 --> 06:27.839
ineligible because of this law

06:28.340 --> 06:29.341
Now, I don't know whose idea it was

06:29.341 --> 06:31.843
to hang a shingle on Hillsboro

06:31.843 --> 06:33.345
spelling "horse-and-buggy,"

06:33.845 --> 06:36.848
but as for me, I won't invest in antiquity.

06:36.848 --> 06:38.850
I want my bank holding credit

06:38.850 --> 06:42.854
with New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois,

06:42.854 --> 06:46.358
and I may want my son to go to Yale.

06:46.358 --> 06:49.361
Now, I believe in--
just as much as anyone in this room--

06:49.361 --> 06:52.864
in a basic fundamentalist interpretation of the bible,

06:52.864 --> 06:55.867
but we can't close our eyes to all progress,

06:56.368 --> 06:57.369
to everything which represents--

06:57.869 --> 07:00.255
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

07:00.255 --> 07:02.757
"Matthew Harrison Brady volunteers to prosecute

07:03.258 --> 07:04.759
in monkey trial."

07:07.879 --> 07:10.382
Matthew Harrison Brady.

07:10.382 --> 07:12.384
the lord has sent us his right hand.

07:12.384 --> 07:13.885
and I'll be working with him.

07:13.885 --> 07:15.387
They'll come pouring out of the hills.

07:15.387 --> 07:18.390
This town will fill up like a rain barrel in a flood.

07:18.390 --> 07:20.892
It'll be bigger than the Chautauqua
at Chattanooga,

07:20.892 --> 07:23.395
And people are gonna have to have
some place to stay...

07:23.395 --> 07:24.896
and they gotta eat.

07:24.896 --> 07:28.400
This'll put Hillsboro on the map of this country.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.902
Let us give thanks to the lord.

07:30.902 --> 07:32.487
Let us pray.

07:32.487 --> 07:34.990
You better start praying, son.

07:34.990 --> 07:38.493
imagine-- Matthew Harrison Brady coming here.

07:38.493 --> 07:40.495
I voted for him for president,

07:40.495 --> 07:41.496
Twice--

07:41.496 --> 07:45.500
once in 1900
and again in 08

07:45.500 --> 07:48.503
I wasn't old enough to vote for him the first time he run,

07:48.503 --> 07:50.505
but my Pa did.

07:50.505 --> 07:54.509
I seen him once at a Chautauqua meeting in Chattanooga.

07:54.509 --> 07:57.012
When he spoke, the tent poles shook.

07:59.014 --> 08:00.515
Who's going to be your lawyer, son

08:00.515 --> 08:01.516
I don't know yet.

08:01.516 --> 08:03.518
I wrote to that newspaper in Baltimore.

08:03.518 --> 08:05.020
they're sending somebody.

08:05.020 --> 08:08.023
well, he better be loud.

08:08.023 --> 08:10.025
[Knocking at door]

08:10.025 --> 08:14.029
Ahh, probably one of
those newspaper reporters.

08:15.030 --> 08:16.531
You're a popular fellow.

08:16.531 --> 08:18.033
Yeah.

08:18.033 --> 08:20.535
Oh, Bert, you don't mind, do you.

08:20.535 --> 08:22.537
Just for the looks of it

08:22.537 --> 08:24.539
Can't tell who it might be.

08:24.539 --> 08:26.541
Sure. Don't worry about it, Mort.

08:28.543 --> 08:30.045
[Knocking]

08:44.559 --> 08:46.061
[Knocking]

08:46.061 --> 08:48.063
All right,
All right.

08:51.066 --> 08:54.319
[Knocking]

08:54.319 --> 08:55.320
Who is it

08:55.320 --> 08:56.321
[Woman] Mort

08:57.822 --> 08:59.324
Rachel.

08:59.324 --> 09:00.825
Come on in.

09:01.326 --> 09:03.828
Ahh, you got a present for Bert, huh

09:04.829 --> 09:07.832
Mort, don't let my father know
I came here.

09:07.832 --> 09:09.834
Well, the Reverend don't tell me his business.

09:09.834 --> 09:12.337
I don't see why I should tell him mine

09:12.337 --> 09:13.338
Is Bert all right

09:13.838 --> 09:14.839
Oh, of course he's--

09:15.340 --> 09:17.342
The safest place in the world's in the jail.

09:17.342 --> 09:19.844
Come on in. Come on.

09:31.356 --> 09:33.358
Tell them you're sorry.

09:33.358 --> 09:35.860
Tell them it was all a mistake.

09:35.860 --> 09:37.362
Please te--

09:38.863 --> 09:40.365
tell them if they let my body out of jail

09:40.865 --> 09:42.367
I'd lock up my mind

09:45.370 --> 09:47.872
Could you stand that, Rachel

09:47.872 --> 09:48.873
at least we'd be together.

09:49.374 --> 09:50.875
It wouldn't be the...

09:52.877 --> 09:54.879
It wouldn't be the same.

10:04.389 --> 10:07.892
Rachel, do you remember

10:07.892 --> 10:11.896
those warm, dark nights down by the riverbank,

10:13.398 --> 10:15.900
just watching the water,

10:15.900 --> 10:19.404
wondering about the...the
miracle of it,

10:19.904 --> 10:21.906
wondering what the stars were for...

10:22.407 --> 10:25.410
what's on the other side of the moon

10:25.410 --> 10:27.912
There'd be no more of that, Rach.

10:27.912 --> 10:29.414
We could still have that.

10:29.414 --> 10:30.915
No, we couldn't.

10:31.416 --> 10:32.917
That would be in the locked-off part...

10:32.917 --> 10:34.419
for both of us.

10:34.419 --> 10:35.920
[Man]
Well...

10:40.425 --> 10:42.927
So, this is where the fate of learning

10:43.428 --> 10:45.430
will be decided for the next 10,000 years.

10:45.430 --> 10:47.932
O tempora, o mores.

10:48.933 --> 10:51.436
Well, I see we have

10:51.436 --> 10:54.939
both beauty and biology on our side.

10:54.939 --> 10:55.940
Who are you

10:55.940 --> 10:57.442
This your writing

10:57.442 --> 10:58.443
Yes.

10:58.943 --> 10:59.944
This is mine.

10:59.944 --> 11:01.446
Hornbeck. E.K. Hornbeck,

11:01.446 --> 11:02.947
Baltimore Herald.

11:02.947 --> 11:03.948
I've been waiting to hear from you.

11:03.948 --> 11:05.950
Read it.

11:05.950 --> 11:07.452
My typewriter's been singing

11:07.452 --> 11:10.955
a sweet, sad song about the
Hillsboro heretic--

11:10.955 --> 11:13.458
B. Cates, latter-Day Dreyfus

11:13.958 --> 11:15.960
Ok. Romeo with a biology bo

11:16.961 --> 11:18.463
want a bite

11:18.963 --> 11:19.964
Oh, don't worry.

11:19.964 --> 11:20.965
I'm not the serpent, little eva.

11:21.466 --> 11:23.468
This isn't from the tree of knowledge.

11:23.468 --> 11:24.969
Oh, no.

11:24.969 --> 11:25.970
You won't find one growing

11:26.471 --> 11:28.473
in "Heavenly Hillsboro."

11:28.473 --> 11:29.974
A few ignorance bushes, perhaps,

11:29.974 --> 11:32.477
but no tree of knowledge.

11:32.977 --> 11:34.479
Ask adam.

11:34.979 --> 11:36.981
You make me sound like a martyr.

11:36.981 --> 11:38.483
You could be.

11:38.483 --> 11:39.984
Martyrs always have a point to prove,

11:40.485 --> 11:41.486
and so do you,

11:41.486 --> 11:44.489
but you haven't won your halo yet.

11:44.489 --> 11:46.491
that won't come until they've tossed you

11:46.491 --> 11:49.494
into the arena...
with the lion.

11:50.495 --> 11:51.496
You mean Brady

11:51.496 --> 11:53.498
I don't want Bert to be a martyr.

11:53.498 --> 11:55.500
What are you trying to prove, anyway

11:56.000 --> 11:57.502
Rach, I'm not trying to prove anything.

11:57.502 --> 11:59.003
All I want to do is teach my students

11:59.504 --> 12:01.005
that man just wasn't planted here

12:01.005 --> 12:03.007
like a Geranium in a flowerpot

12:03.007 --> 12:05.009
that life comes from a long miracle.

12:05.009 --> 12:06.511
It just didn't take 7 days.

12:06.511 --> 12:08.012
But it's against the law.

12:08.513 --> 12:10.515
a schoolteacher's a public servant.

12:10.515 --> 12:14.018
He should do what the law and the school board want him to.

12:14.018 --> 12:16.521
Has the accused anything to say in his own defense

12:16.521 --> 12:21.025
If not, I sentence you to life as a public servant,

12:21.025 --> 12:24.028
a silent butler in the service of
your school board.

12:24.529 --> 12:28.032
Wastebaskets for ideas on sale in the outer lobby.

12:28.032 --> 12:31.035
I don't see anything funny in this, Mr. Hornbeck.

12:31.035 --> 12:33.037
Objection sustained.
Neither do I.

12:33.037 --> 12:35.540
Then why don't you just leave us alone

12:35.540 --> 12:36.541
You newspaper people

12:36.541 --> 12:39.043
have stirred up enough trouble for Bert.

12:39.043 --> 12:41.546
what do you want, anyway

12:41.546 --> 12:45.049
I came to tell boy Socrates here

12:45.049 --> 12:48.052
that the Baltimore Herald is opposed to Hemlock,

12:48.553 --> 12:50.054
and will provide a lawyer.

12:50.555 --> 12:52.056
Who

12:52.056 --> 12:53.057
Who

12:53.057 --> 12:55.560
I don't know yet, but what's the difference

12:55.560 --> 12:56.561
A new lawyer with old tricks,

12:57.061 --> 12:58.062
An old lawyer with new tricks.

12:59.814 --> 13:01.816
Wake up, Copernicus.

13:02.317 --> 13:04.319
The law is still on the side of the lawmakers,

13:04.319 --> 13:07.322
and everything revolves around their terra firma.

13:07.322 --> 13:09.824
Then why bother, you and your newspaper

13:11.326 --> 13:13.328
Because I know that the sunrise

13:13.328 --> 13:14.829
is an optical illusion.

13:16.331 --> 13:18.333
My teacher told me so.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.835
You don't seem like the kind of person who'd want to bother.

13:20.835 --> 13:21.836
You seem so--

13:21.836 --> 13:23.838
cynical.
True, true

13:24.339 --> 13:26.341
That's part of my fascination

13:26.341 --> 13:27.342
I do hateful things

13:27.342 --> 13:28.843
for which people love me

13:28.843 --> 13:31.846
and I do lovable things for which they hate me.

13:31.846 --> 13:34.349
I'm admired for my detestability.

13:36.851 --> 13:39.354
Now, don't worry, little Eva.

13:39.354 --> 13:41.856
I may be rancid butter,

13:42.357 --> 13:44.359
but I'm on your side of the bread.

13:54.669 --> 13:56.671
[Choir]
Give me that old time religion

13:56.671 --> 13:58.673
Give me that old time religion

13:59.173 --> 14:01.676
Give me that old time religion

14:01.676 --> 14:03.678
It's good enough for me

14:03.678 --> 14:05.680
Give me that old time religion

14:05.680 --> 14:07.682
Give me that old time religion

14:08.182 --> 14:10.184
Give me that old time religion

14:10.184 --> 14:12.186
It's good enough for me

14:12.186 --> 14:14.689
It was good for old Jonah

14:14.689 --> 14:16.691
It was good for old Jonah

14:17.191 --> 14:19.193
It was good for old Jonah

14:19.193 --> 14:21.195
and it's good enough for me

14:21.696 --> 14:23.698
Give me that old time religion

14:23.698 --> 14:25.700
Give me that old time religion

14:26.200 --> 14:28.202
Give me that old time religion

14:28.202 --> 14:30.204
it's good enough for me

14:30.705 --> 14:32.707
it was good for little David

14:32.707 --> 14:34.709
it was good for little David

14:34.709 --> 14:37.211
it was good for little David

14:37.211 --> 14:39.213
and it's good enough for me

14:39.213 --> 14:41.716
Oh, give me that old time religion

14:41.716 --> 14:43.718
Give me that old time religion

14:43.718 --> 14:46.220
Give me that old time religion

14:46.220 --> 14:48.222
It's good enough for me

14:48.222 --> 14:50.224
Just give me that old time religion

14:50.725 --> 14:52.727
Give me that old time religion

14:52.727 --> 14:55.229
Give me that old time religion

14:55.229 --> 14:57.231
It's good enough for me

14:57.348 --> 14:59.350
It was good for little David

14:59.350 --> 15:01.352
It was good for little David

15:01.853 --> 15:03.855
It was good for little David

15:03.855 --> 15:05.857
and it's good enough for me

15:05.857 --> 15:08.359
Oh, give me that old time religion

15:08.359 --> 15:10.361
Give me that old time religion

15:10.862 --> 15:12.864
Give me that old time religion

15:13.364 --> 15:14.866
It's good enough for me

15:14.866 --> 15:17.368
Just give me that old time religion

15:17.368 --> 15:19.370
Give me that old time religion

15:19.370 --> 15:21.873
Give me that old time religion

15:21.873 --> 15:24.008
It's good enough for me

15:24.008 --> 15:26.511
It was good for old Jonah

15:26.511 --> 15:28.513
It was good for old Jonah

15:28.513 --> 15:31.015
It was good for old Jonah

15:31.015 --> 15:33.017
and it's good enough for me

15:33.017 --> 15:35.520
It was good for old Jonah

15:35.520 --> 15:37.522
It was good for old Jonah

15:37.522 --> 15:40.024
It was good for old Jonah

15:40.024 --> 15:41.526
and it's good enough for me

15:41.526 --> 15:44.028
Oh, give me that old time religion

15:44.529 --> 15:46.531
Give me that old time religion

15:46.531 --> 15:49.033
Give me that old time religion

15:49.033 --> 15:51.035
It's good enough for me

15:51.536 --> 15:54.539
Matthew Harrison Brady...

15:54.539 --> 15:58.292
as mayor of Hillsboro,
may I say that this municipality

15:58.292 --> 16:00.795
is proud to have within its city limits

16:01.295 --> 16:05.299
the warrior who has always fought for us ordinary people.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.301
Why the lady folk of this town would not have the vote

16:07.802 --> 16:09.303
If it hadn't been for you fighting

16:09.303 --> 16:12.306
To give them all that suffrage.

16:12.306 --> 16:14.809
Mr. President Wilson would not have got to the white house

16:15.309 --> 16:16.310
and won the war

16:16.310 --> 16:18.312
If it hadn't been for you supporting him

16:18.312 --> 16:21.315
and being his secretary of state

16:21.315 --> 16:25.820
In conclusion, the governor of our glorious state

16:25.820 --> 16:27.822
has vested in me the authority

16:27.822 --> 16:30.825
to confer upon you a commission

16:30.825 --> 16:34.829
as honorary colonel in the state militia.

16:34.829 --> 16:36.330
[Cheering]

16:36.831 --> 16:39.083
If it's good enough for Brady...

16:39.083 --> 16:41.085
If it's good enough for Brady

16:41.085 --> 16:43.588
then it's good enough for me

16:43.588 --> 16:45.706
[Cheering]

16:50.211 --> 16:52.713
Col. Brady--

16:52.713 --> 16:54.715
I like the sound of that.

16:54.715 --> 16:57.218
[Crowd chuckling]

16:57.218 --> 17:02.223
Friends, Mrs. Brady and I are delighted

17:02.223 --> 17:03.458
to be among you.

17:04.459 --> 17:07.712
We all voted for you-- 3 times!

17:07.712 --> 17:10.714
I trust it was in 3 separate elections.

17:10.714 --> 17:13.217
[Crowd laughing]

17:13.217 --> 17:15.720
I could only wish for one thing--

17:15.720 --> 17:19.223
that you had not given us quite so
warm a welcome.

17:19.357 --> 17:20.358
[Laughing]

17:20.358 --> 17:21.358
[Women's voice]
Mr. Brady
Mr. Brady

17:21.358 --> 17:22.359
Yes

17:22.359 --> 17:23.361
Here you are.

17:23.361 --> 17:24.862
Oh, bless you, bless you.

17:24.862 --> 17:25.863
And Mrs. Brady.

17:25.863 --> 17:27.365
Thank you.

17:27.365 --> 17:29.367
And now then,

17:29.367 --> 17:33.371
Who, may I ask, is the, uh, spiritual
leader of the community

17:33.371 --> 17:35.373
The Rev.
Jeremiah Brown

17:35.873 --> 17:36.874
Go on,
Reverend.

17:36.874 --> 17:37.875
How are you, Reverend

17:37.875 --> 17:40.378
Will you stand here at my side thank you.

17:40.378 --> 17:41.379
Ahem.

17:42.246 --> 17:44.248
My friends of Hillsboro,

17:45.750 --> 17:49.253
You know why I have come here.

17:49.253 --> 17:52.256
It is not merely to prosecute a lawbreaker,

17:52.256 --> 17:55.760
a young man who has spoken out against the revealed word.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.261
I have come here

17:57.261 --> 17:59.263
because what has happened in a schoolroom in your town

17:59.263 --> 18:00.765
has unloosed a wicked attack

18:00.765 --> 18:03.267
from the big cities of the north.

18:03.267 --> 18:05.770
We did not seek this struggle.

18:05.770 --> 18:07.772
We are simple folk,

18:07.772 --> 18:10.775
who seek only to live in brotherhood and peace,

18:10.775 --> 18:13.277
to cherish our loved ones,

18:13.277 --> 18:15.780
to teach our children the ways of righteousness

18:15.780 --> 18:17.281
and of the lord.

18:17.281 --> 18:20.785
But what would they teach them, these idolaters,

18:20.785 --> 18:23.287
these priests of "evil-ution"

18:23.287 --> 18:24.789
what would they have them do

18:24.789 --> 18:27.291
they would have them measure the distance between the stars

18:27.291 --> 18:30.044
and forget him who holds the
stars in his hands.

18:30.044 --> 18:32.046
they are lost, my friends.

18:32.046 --> 18:35.550
For, I tell you, if man believes he is descended from the beasts,

18:35.550 --> 18:37.552
he must remain a beast!

18:37.552 --> 18:40.054
and as the young wolf turns upon the old,

18:40.054 --> 18:43.558
these innocent ones, corrupted and despairing of salvation,

18:43.558 --> 18:45.560
will turn upon their fathers,

18:45.560 --> 18:48.195
and our land will become a land of sodom and gomorrah

18:48.195 --> 18:50.698
of pestilence, of fire, of hatred and of death.

18:50.698 --> 18:52.199
I disagree.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.201
[Crowd murmuring]

18:54.201 --> 18:55.319
Who are you

18:56.821 --> 18:58.322
Uh, Hornbeck.

18:58.823 --> 19:01.325
E.K. Hornbeck of the Baltimore Herald.

19:01.325 --> 19:02.827
Oh, yeah.

19:02.827 --> 19:04.829
Yes, I know your paper...

19:05.830 --> 19:07.832
and your writings, Sir.

19:07.832 --> 19:09.834
Ladies and gentlemen

19:09.834 --> 19:11.335
my paper is happy to announce

19:11.836 --> 19:13.337
that it is sending two representatives

19:13.838 --> 19:16.340
to, uh, "Heavenly Hillsboro"--

19:16.340 --> 19:18.843
the most gifted reporter in America today--

19:18.843 --> 19:19.844
Myself--

19:19.844 --> 19:20.845
[Crowd laughing]

19:20.845 --> 19:23.347
and the most agile legal mind

19:23.347 --> 19:25.850
of the 20th century--

19:25.850 --> 19:27.985
Henry Drummond.

19:27.985 --> 19:28.986
[Crowd murmuring]

19:28.986 --> 19:29.737
[man]
who's Henry Drummond

19:29.737 --> 19:31.739
We'll send him back to hell!

19:31.739 --> 19:33.741
ride him out on a rail!

19:33.858 --> 19:35.359
Don't let him into town!

19:35.359 --> 19:36.360
Keep him out!

19:36.861 --> 19:38.613
[Everyone yelling]

19:44.001 --> 19:45.503
No, no, no.

19:45.503 --> 19:48.506
I believe we should welcome Henry Drummond.

19:48.506 --> 19:50.508
If the enemy sends his goliath into battle,

19:50.508 --> 19:52.510
it magnifies our cause.

19:53.010 --> 19:56.013
Henry Drummond has stalked the courtrooms of this land

19:56.013 --> 19:57.014
for 40 years.

19:57.014 --> 19:59.517
When he fights, headlines follow.

19:59.517 --> 20:03.521
The whole world will be watching our
victory over Drummond.

20:03.521 --> 20:06.524
If st. george had killed a dragonfly
instead of a dragon,

20:06.524 --> 20:08.025
who would remember him

20:08.025 --> 20:09.527
[Laughing]

20:09.527 --> 20:12.029
We here in Hillsboro have not only the opportunity

20:12.029 --> 20:13.531
to slay the devil's disciple

20:13.531 --> 20:15.533
but the devil himself!

20:15.533 --> 20:18.536
If it's good enough for Brady...

20:18.536 --> 20:20.538
if it's good enough for Brady

20:20.538 --> 20:23.040
if it's good enough for Brady

20:23.040 --> 20:25.042
if it's good enough for Brady

20:25.042 --> 20:27.044
then it's good enough for me

20:27.044 --> 20:29.547
Oh, give me that old time religion

20:29.547 --> 20:31.298
Give me that old time religion

20:31.799 --> 20:33.801
Give me that old time religion

20:34.301 --> 20:35.670
It's good enough for me

20:35.670 --> 20:38.055
Oh, give me that old time religion

20:38.055 --> 20:40.174
Give me that old time religion

20:40.675 --> 20:41.676
Give me that old time religion

20:42.176 --> 20:44.178
You're the stranger, ain't you

20:44.178 --> 20:47.682
are you looking for a nice, clean place to stay

20:47.682 --> 20:50.685
I had a nice, clean place to stay, madam,

20:50.685 --> 20:53.187
and I left it to come here.

20:53.688 --> 20:55.189
If it's good enough for Brady

20:55.189 --> 20:57.692
If it's good enough for Brady

20:57.692 --> 20:59.694
if it's good enough for Brady

20:59.694 --> 21:02.196
then it's good enough for me

21:03.197 --> 21:05.616
[Playing organ]

21:24.635 --> 21:25.636
Rachel.

21:32.143 --> 21:34.645
I waited supper for you.
it's on the table

21:45.656 --> 21:48.159
peace will come, my daughter.

21:48.159 --> 21:49.660
God we must thank

21:49.660 --> 21:51.662
that the sinner stands naked and exposed.

21:52.163 --> 21:53.664
Stop preaching, Pa.

21:53.664 --> 21:54.665
I have something to tell you.

21:54.665 --> 21:56.167
You're upset, daughter.

21:56.667 --> 21:57.668
Eat something and we'll talk in the morning.

21:57.668 --> 22:01.172
No. Now. I'm not leaving Bert.

22:03.674 --> 22:06.177
I don't understand.

22:06.177 --> 22:08.179
You heard what Mr. Brady said

22:08.179 --> 22:10.681
I love him, Pa. I love him.

22:10.681 --> 22:13.184
No, no. that is the love of Judas.

22:13.184 --> 22:15.186
This man has nothing to offer you but sin.

22:15.186 --> 22:17.188
I told you that from the beginning.

22:17.188 --> 22:18.189
what's he done

22:18.689 --> 22:20.191
what's he done that's so terrible

22:20.191 --> 22:22.693
Why do you hate him so

22:23.194 --> 22:27.198
Because I love god, and I hate his enemies.

22:27.698 --> 22:28.699
Bert loves God.

22:28.699 --> 22:31.202
Then what is he doing with Henry Drummond

22:31.702 --> 22:33.704
Why is he bringing Henry Drummond here

22:33.704 --> 22:38.209
to spew his atheistic filth into the ears of our people

22:38.209 --> 22:39.710
You're a schoolteacher.

22:39.710 --> 22:43.214
You know how easy it is to mold
minds for good

22:43.214 --> 22:44.715
or to twist them for evil.

22:44.715 --> 22:46.217
Bert didn't twist any minds.

22:46.217 --> 22:48.719
You're infected with the poison of his agnosticism.

22:48.719 --> 22:50.721
Now get down on your knees and pray for forgiveness.

22:51.222 --> 22:52.223
Forgiveness for what

22:52.223 --> 22:53.724
Because you have betrayed me.

22:53.724 --> 22:54.725
You have betrayed your faith.

22:54.725 --> 22:56.727
I'm not betraying anybody.

22:58.229 --> 22:59.730
I'm glad your mother isn't here

22:59.730 --> 23:01.232
to see what's become of you.

23:02.733 --> 23:04.735
If she is looking down from heaven,

23:04.735 --> 23:09.240
I ask her to forgive you and to forgive me.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.742
Pa, ever since I was a little girl,

23:11.742 --> 23:13.744
I'd wake up in the middle of the night

23:13.744 --> 23:15.246
afraid of the dark,

23:15.246 --> 23:17.248
like the house was upside down,

23:17.248 --> 23:18.749
and if I didn't hang onto the Mattress,

23:19.250 --> 23:21.752
I'd fall out into the sky--

23:21.752 --> 23:23.254
Forgive her, Mother,

23:23.254 --> 23:24.755
Forgive her, dear God...

23:24.755 --> 23:26.257
I wanted to run to you,

23:26.257 --> 23:28.259
to have you tell me that I was safe,

23:28.259 --> 23:30.261
that everything was all right,

23:30.261 --> 23:33.264
but I was always more afraid of you than of falling.

23:33.264 --> 23:35.266
It's the same way now.

23:35.266 --> 23:36.767
I have failed.

23:40.271 --> 23:42.273
Tell me what to do, dear lord.

23:47.278 --> 23:49.280
Pa, get up. Please get up.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.282
And I will sprinkle clean water upon you,

23:51.782 --> 23:53.784
and you shall be clean.

23:53.784 --> 23:56.287
From all your filthiness and from your idols

23:56.287 --> 23:58.289
Will I cleanse you

23:58.289 --> 24:00.791
and a new heart also will I give you

24:00.791 --> 24:03.294

24:03.794 --> 24:08.299

devolution is not a theory but a proven fact.

25:58.042 --> 26:03.047
My friends, man
did not evolve from the ape,

26:03.047 --> 26:08.052
but the ape devolved from man.

26:08.052 --> 26:10.554
Now, you take a look at this creature sitting here.

26:11.055 --> 26:15.059
There before you is an example
of the ungrace

26:15.059 --> 26:18.562
to which man can fall because of his own bestiality.

26:18.562 --> 26:20.064
Look at those beady little brows.

26:20.564 --> 26:22.066

26:24.068 --> 26:26.070

26:26.570 --> 26:30.574

No questions. Not acceptable.

35:00.834 --> 35:04.337
Does Mr. Drummond refuse this man a place on the jury

35:04.337 --> 35:06.339
simply because he believes in the bible

35:06.339 --> 35:08.341
If you find an evolutionist in this town,

35:08.341 --> 35:10.844
you can refuse him.

35:11.344 --> 35:12.846
I object to the defense attorney

35:13.346 --> 35:15.348
rejecting a worthy citizen

35:15.348 --> 35:17.350
Without so much as asking
him a question

35:19.853 --> 35:21.855
All right, I'll ask him a question.

35:34.251 --> 35:35.752
How are you

35:35.752 --> 35:37.754
Well... kind of hot.

35:38.255 --> 35:39.756
Me, too.

35:39.756 --> 35:41.258
Excused.

35:42.759 --> 35:44.761
[Laughing]

35:44.761 --> 35:46.263
[Gavel pounding]

35:50.767 --> 35:52.769
You are excused from jury duty, Jessie.

35:52.769 --> 35:53.770
You may step down.

35:53.770 --> 35:54.771
Your honor,

35:56.139 --> 35:59.142
I object to the note of levity

35:59.643 --> 36:01.144
which the counsel for the defense

36:01.144 --> 36:03.146
is introducing into these proceedings.

36:03.146 --> 36:05.649
The court agrees with you in spirit, Col. Brady.

36:05.649 --> 36:08.652
And I object to all this Col. Brady talk.

36:08.652 --> 36:12.656
I am not familiar with Mr. Brady's military record.

36:12.656 --> 36:14.658
Well, he was made honorary colonel

36:14.658 --> 36:18.161
in our state militia the day he arrived in Hillsboro.

36:18.161 --> 36:21.164
Well, the use of the title prejudices the case of my client.

36:21.665 --> 36:24.167
It calls up a picture of the prosecution

36:24.167 --> 36:25.669
a stride a white horse

36:25.669 --> 36:29.673
a blaze in the uniform of a military colonel

36:29.673 --> 36:32.175
and with all the forces of right and righteousness

36:32.175 --> 36:34.177
marshaled behind him.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.181
Well, we certainly want to give you

36:38.181 --> 36:39.683
a fair hearing in this courtroom.

36:40.183 --> 36:43.687
We don't want anything prejudicial to your client.

36:44.187 --> 36:46.189
What do you suggest we do, counselor

36:46.189 --> 36:49.192
Break him. Make him a private.

36:49.192 --> 36:50.694
I have no serious objection

36:50.694 --> 36:52.696
to the honorary title of Private Brady.

36:52.696 --> 36:54.197
[Crowd murmuring]

37:06.710 --> 37:08.712
You better do something about this, Jason.

37:10.213 --> 37:11.715
Get him up here.

37:11.715 --> 37:13.216
Oh, Mr. drummond.

37:17.721 --> 37:19.222
You know our mayor, Mr. Drummond.

37:19.222 --> 37:20.223
Yes.

37:20.724 --> 37:22.225
I believe he has a suggestion to make

37:22.225 --> 37:26.229
By, uh, by authority of, uh...

37:26.229 --> 37:29.232
well, I'm sure the governor won't have
any objection--

37:29.232 --> 37:30.734
I hereby appoint you, Mr. Drummond,

37:31.234 --> 37:34.237
a temporary honorary colonel in the state militia.

37:35.739 --> 37:36.740
Well...

37:36.740 --> 37:39.242
Well, gentlemen, what can I say

37:40.243 --> 37:41.745
it certainly is not every day

37:41.745 --> 37:43.747
that a man attains the exalted position

37:43.747 --> 37:46.249
of temporary honorary colonel.

37:46.249 --> 37:47.751
I thank you.

37:51.254 --> 37:53.757
Col. Brady,
Col. Drummond,

37:53.757 --> 37:55.759
You will examine the next venireman.

37:55.759 --> 37:56.760
Mort.

37:59.262 --> 38:00.764
George Sillers!

38:01.264 --> 38:03.266
You're next,
George.

38:09.272 --> 38:11.775
State your name and occupation, George

38:11.775 --> 38:15.278
George Sillers. I work at the feed store.

38:18.281 --> 38:21.785
Tell me, sir, would you call yourself a religious man

38:21.785 --> 38:23.787
Well, I guess I'm as religious as the next fellow.

38:23.787 --> 38:26.790
in Hillsboro, sir, that means a great deal.

38:26.790 --> 38:28.291
[Crowd agreeing]

38:29.292 --> 38:30.794
Tell me, Mr. sillers,

38:31.294 --> 38:32.912
Do you have any children

38:32.912 --> 38:35.298
Uh, not as I know of.

38:35.298 --> 38:37.300
[Laughing]

38:37.300 --> 38:40.303
If you had a son, Mr. Sillers, or a daughter

38:40.303 --> 38:42.305
what would you think if that sweet child

38:42.305 --> 38:43.807
came home from school

38:43.807 --> 38:45.308
and told you that a godless teacher-

38:45.809 --> 38:48.812
Objection! We're supposed to be
selecting jury members.

38:48.812 --> 38:50.814
The prosecution is denouncing the defendant

38:50.814 --> 38:52.816
before the trial has even begun.

38:53.933 --> 38:55.435
Objection sustained.

38:57.437 --> 38:59.439
Mr. Sillers, do you have any personal opinions

38:59.939 --> 39:01.441
with regard to
the defendant

39:01.441 --> 39:04.444
that might prejudice you on his behalf

39:04.444 --> 39:05.445
Cates

39:05.445 --> 39:06.446
Hmm.

39:06.446 --> 39:08.948
I don't hardly know the man.

39:09.449 --> 39:11.951
Though he bought some peat moss from me one time.

39:11.951 --> 39:13.703
H-he paid his bill.

39:13.703 --> 39:15.205
Mr. Sillers impresses me

39:15.205 --> 39:18.708
as an honest, god-fearing man.
I accept him.

39:18.708 --> 39:20.710
Thank you,
Col. Brady.

39:20.710 --> 39:22.462
Col. Drummond

39:28.968 --> 39:30.470
Now, Mr. Sillers,

39:30.470 --> 39:33.973
You, ah, you have just said that, ah, you were a religious man.

39:33.973 --> 39:35.475
Do you work at it very hard

39:35.975 --> 39:38.978
Well, I'm pretty busy down at the feed store

39:38.978 --> 39:40.980
My wife tends the religion for both of us.

39:40.980 --> 39:42.482
Oh, I see, I see.

39:43.483 --> 39:44.984
You take care of this life,

39:45.485 --> 39:46.986
and she takes care of the next
one, is that it

39:46.986 --> 39:49.989
that is objected to as immaterial
and argumentative.

39:50.490 --> 39:51.991
[Judge] objection sustained.

39:53.493 --> 39:54.994
Now, tell me, Mr. Sillers,

39:54.994 --> 39:57.497
While your wife has been taking care of the religion for the family

39:57.497 --> 39:59.749
have you ever heard of a fellow called Charles Darwin

40:00.250 --> 40:02.252
Oh, not till recent.

40:02.252 --> 40:04.254
Well, tell me something.

40:04.504 --> 40:06.005
From what you've heard of this fellow Darwin,

40:06.005 --> 40:07.006
do you think he's the kind of a man

40:07.507 --> 40:08.508
you might invite up for Sunday dinner

40:09.008 --> 40:12.011
Your honor, my worthy opponent from Chicago

40:12.512 --> 40:14.514
is cluttering up the issue with hypothetical questions.

40:14.514 --> 40:16.516
I have already established

40:16.516 --> 40:19.018
that Mr. Sillers is not working very hard at religion.

40:19.018 --> 40:20.520
Now, for your sake

40:20.520 --> 40:22.021
I'm trying to establish

40:22.021 --> 40:24.657
that he is not
working at evolution.

40:24.657 --> 40:26.659
Oh, I'm just working at the feed store.

40:26.659 --> 40:28.161
[Laughing]

40:28.161 --> 40:29.913
[Gavel pounding]

40:29.913 --> 40:32.415
Mr. Sillers, do you think you can render impartial--

40:32.415 --> 40:34.918
Objection! The prosecution has already accepted this man.

40:34.918 --> 40:36.419
But all I want is a fair trial.

40:36.419 --> 40:37.420
So do I.

40:37.420 --> 40:38.421
Unless the state of mind

40:38.421 --> 40:39.422
of the members of the jury

40:39.422 --> 40:41.925
conforms to the laws and patterns of society--

40:41.925 --> 40:44.427
Oh, conform, conform. what
do you want to do

40:44.427 --> 40:45.929
run the jury through a meat grinder

40:45.929 --> 40:47.931
to have them all come out the same

40:47.931 --> 40:49.933
Take a box seat there, Mr. Sillers

40:49.933 --> 40:52.435
Your honor! Your honor! this is ludicrous!

40:52.435 --> 40:54.437
Gentlemen, you are both out of order.

40:54.938 --> 40:57.440
The bench rules that the jury has been selected.

40:59.442 --> 41:00.944
Due to the excessive heat

41:00.944 --> 41:03.947
court is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

41:03.947 --> 41:06.449
[Chattering]

41:06.449 --> 41:08.451
Ah, one moment, please. one moment

41:09.953 --> 41:11.955
Order in the court

41:12.455 --> 41:14.457
Rev. Brown has asked me to announce

41:17.460 --> 41:21.331
"Pray for justice and guidance." All are invited.

41:21.831 --> 41:24.334
Your honor, I object to that commercial announcement.

41:25.969 --> 41:28.087
commercial announcement

41:28.087 --> 41:29.589
of the Rev. brown's product.

41:29.589 --> 41:30.590
Why don't you announce

41:31.090 --> 41:32.592
that there's going to be an evolution meeting

41:32.592 --> 41:35.094
I have no knowledge of such a meeting.

41:35.094 --> 41:37.096
That's quite understandable.

41:37.096 --> 41:38.097
It isn't enough

41:38.097 --> 41:40.099
that everybody who comes into this courtroom

41:40.099 --> 41:43.102
has to pass under a sign which says
read your bible.

41:43.102 --> 41:45.104
I want that sign taken down, your honor.

41:45.104 --> 41:47.106
[Crowd]
No! No!

41:49.108 --> 41:51.110
Or else I want another sign put up

41:51.110 --> 41:53.613
just as big with just as big letters

41:53.613 --> 41:55.114
which says read your Darwin.

41:55.615 --> 41:58.117
[Cheering and booing]

42:00.119 --> 42:02.121
That's what I mean about this man.

42:02.622 --> 42:04.123
[Judge] order!

42:04.123 --> 42:06.125
Your honor, your honor, we want the learned counsel from the North

42:06.626 --> 42:08.628
to get every fairness and consideration

42:08.628 --> 42:10.129
in this trial.

42:10.129 --> 42:12.131
We must not forget that he is our guest.

42:12.131 --> 42:14.133
Guest, hell! I'm a lawyer in a courtroom.

42:14.634 --> 42:16.135
Then behave like a lawyer.

42:16.135 --> 42:17.136
Stop using this courtroom

42:17.136 --> 42:19.138
as a platform for your obscene ideas

42:19.138 --> 42:21.524
trying to dirty the minds of our young people here.

42:21.524 --> 42:24.527
You are both out of order. Court is adjourned.

42:25.028 --> 42:27.530
My conduct in this courtroom is not under question,

42:27.530 --> 42:28.531
and certainly not by you!

42:28.531 --> 42:30.033
Well, your language is!

42:30.033 --> 42:32.535
I don't swear just for the hell of it!

42:32.535 --> 42:35.038
Language is a poor enough means of communication.

42:35.538 --> 42:37.540
I think we should use all the words we've got.

42:37.540 --> 42:41.044
Besides, there are damned few words that anybody understands!

42:46.249 --> 42:48.751
Henry Drummond, atheist!

42:48.751 --> 42:52.755
You! what are you going to say in your paper now

42:52.755 --> 42:56.259
"He that sups with the devil must
have a long spoon."

42:59.262 --> 43:01.764
[Chattering]

43:07.153 --> 43:08.654
[Man] Let's go.

43:08.654 --> 43:10.156
Let's go folks, clear the floor.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.163
We'll fix you, Cates. we'll run you out of town.

43:20.666 --> 43:21.667
Well, anyway,

43:21.667 --> 43:24.170
the Baltimore Herald is with you...

43:24.170 --> 43:26.172
right up to the lynching.

43:33.679 --> 43:34.680
Bert...

43:36.182 --> 43:38.684
Bert, you've got to call the whole
thing off now.

43:38.684 --> 43:40.186
who are you, young lady

43:40.186 --> 43:42.188
This is Rachel Brown. We're engaged.

43:42.188 --> 43:43.689
Brown Rev. Brown's daughter

43:44.190 --> 43:46.192
Don't you see what's happening, Bert

43:46.192 --> 43:49.195
They're using you as a weapon against your own people.

43:49.195 --> 43:52.198
What you think or believe isn't the point anymore.

43:52.198 --> 43:53.699
You're helping something bad.

43:53.699 --> 43:55.701
No, young lady, it's not as simple as all that--

43:55.701 --> 43:58.704
good or bad, black or white , day or night.

43:58.704 --> 44:00.706
do you know that at the top of the world

44:00.706 --> 44:02.708
the twilight is 6 months long

44:02.708 --> 44:05.211
Bert and I don't live on top of the world.

44:05.211 --> 44:06.712
We live in Hillsboro.

44:06.712 --> 44:08.714
and when the sun goes down, it's dark.

44:08.714 --> 44:11.217
And why do you have to come here to make it different

44:11.217 --> 44:13.219
I didn't come here to make Hillsboro different.

44:13.219 --> 44:15.721
I came here to defend his right to be different.

44:16.222 --> 44:17.723
And that's the point.

44:18.224 --> 44:19.225
How about it, boy

44:19.725 --> 44:22.728
I don't know what the point is anymore.

44:22.728 --> 44:25.231
I tried to open their kids'
minds...their kids.

44:25.231 --> 44:27.733
I tried to give them knowledge they could use.

44:27.733 --> 44:30.236
they're using it-- as a stranglehold on me.

44:30.736 --> 44:32.238
[Hornbeck]
You're learning, Cates.

44:32.238 --> 44:35.241
Disillusionment is what little heroes are made of

44:35.241 --> 44:38.244
Where do I finish dead with a paper
medal on my chest

44:38.244 --> 44:40.746
"Bert Cates, world's biggest chump-- he died fighting."

44:40.746 --> 44:44.250
Let's face it-- to him, I'm a headline. To you, I'm a cause.

44:44.250 --> 44:46.252
And to yourself

44:46.252 --> 44:47.753
All right, let's face it.

44:47.753 --> 44:50.756
Now, you chose to get into this
by yourself.

44:50.756 --> 44:52.758
You didn't get into it because of his headline

44:53.259 --> 44:54.260
or because of my cause,

44:54.760 --> 44:57.763
or maybe even because of their kids.

44:58.264 --> 44:59.765
You got in to it because of yourself--

44:59.765 --> 45:02.268
Because of something you believed in
for yourself.

45:02.268 --> 45:04.270
I didn't believe it would happen this way.

45:04.270 --> 45:05.771
It can get worse.

45:05.771 --> 45:08.274
Those people are in a lean and hungry mood.

45:08.274 --> 45:10.276
They look at me as if I was a murderer.

45:10.276 --> 45:11.777
[Chuckling] In a way, you are.

45:11.777 --> 45:14.280
You know, you-- you kill one of their fairy-tale notions,

45:14.280 --> 45:15.781
and they'll bring down

45:16.282 --> 45:19.785
the wrath of god, Brady and the state legislature on you every time.

45:19.785 --> 45:21.787
You make a joke out of everything.

45:21.787 --> 45:23.289
Young lady

45:24.290 --> 45:26.292
I know what Bert is going through.

45:26.292 --> 45:28.294
It's the loneliest
feeling in the world.

45:28.794 --> 45:30.296
It's like walking down an empty street

45:30.796 --> 45:34.300
listening to your own footsteps.

45:34.300 --> 45:37.303
But all you have to do is to knock on any door

45:37.803 --> 45:39.805
and say, "if you'll let me in,

45:39.805 --> 45:41.807
"I'll live the way you want me to live,

45:41.807 --> 45:44.810
and I'll think the way "you want me to think,"

45:44.810 --> 45:46.312
and all the blinds will go up,

45:46.312 --> 45:47.813
and all the doors will open,

45:47.813 --> 45:50.816
and you'll never be lonely, ever again.

45:52.818 --> 45:54.820
Now, it's up to you, Cates.

45:54.820 --> 45:57.823
You just say the word, and we'll change the plea--

45:57.823 --> 46:01.327
th-that is, of course, if you honestly believe that the law is right

46:01.327 --> 46:03.329
and you're wrong.

46:03.329 --> 46:04.830
Now, if that's the case, just tell me,

46:04.830 --> 46:06.832
and I'll pack my bag and go back to Chicago

46:06.832 --> 46:09.335
where it's a nice, cool 100
in the shade.

46:09.335 --> 46:11.337
Bert, I've gone to my father's church

46:11.837 --> 46:14.340
every sunday as long as I can remember.

46:14.340 --> 46:16.342
This is where I live.

46:16.342 --> 46:18.844
This is where my children will be born.

46:18.844 --> 46:20.846
What kind of a life could we have

46:23.099 --> 46:25.601
Well, what kind of a life could we have if I gave up now

46:27.103 --> 46:28.104
your father's kind

46:28.104 --> 46:30.106
Hallelujah, and ignorance, here we come

46:30.606 --> 46:32.108
Rach, what goes on in this town is not necessarily

46:32.108 --> 46:34.110
the christian religion everyplace else.

46:39.482 --> 46:41.984
Rach, I can't live the way you want me to

46:43.486 --> 46:45.488
You're the one who's got to decide.

46:46.489 --> 46:48.491
It's his church or our house.

46:48.491 --> 46:49.992
You can't live in both.

46:52.995 --> 46:54.497
[Mort] sorry, Bert.

46:54.997 --> 46:56.999
I have to take you back now.

47:16.519 --> 47:18.521
You ever been in love, Hornbeck

47:19.021 --> 47:21.524
Only with the sound of my own words, thank God.

47:24.527 --> 47:26.529
I have been to their cities

47:27.029 --> 47:29.532
and I have seen the altars upon which they sacrifice

47:29.532 --> 47:32.535
the futures of their children to the gods of science.

47:33.536 --> 47:35.037
And what are their rewards

47:35.037 --> 47:37.039
confusion and self-destruction.

47:37.540 --> 47:40.042
New ways to kill each other in wars

47:40.042 --> 47:43.045
I tell you, gentlemen, the way of scientism is the way of darkness

47:43.045 --> 47:46.048
Now, Mr. Brady, do you, ah, believe
seriously

47:46.048 --> 47:48.050
that the majority of the American people

47:48.551 --> 47:50.553
hold with your views

47:50.553 --> 47:53.556
not just the views
of Matthew Harrison
Brady, Mr. Hornbeck.

47:53.556 --> 47:55.558
There isn't one state in the union

47:55.558 --> 47:58.060
where the evolutionists are in the majority.

47:58.060 --> 48:01.564
It'll be the people themselves of our great land who will speak.

48:01.564 --> 48:04.066
Mr. Brady, how do you account for the unfortunate comment

48:04.066 --> 48:06.068
that your crusade has aroused

48:06.569 --> 48:09.572
the attacks upon me stem from a vociferous minority

48:09.572 --> 48:12.074
which happens to control the press.

48:12.074 --> 48:14.577
I hope you gentlemen--
madam--

48:14.577 --> 48:17.580
will not be influenced by this same negative bias.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.582
Pardon me.

48:20.583 --> 48:23.085
Thank you, O lord, dear father,

48:23.085 --> 48:25.588
from whom all blessings flow, for thy bounty,

48:25.588 --> 48:28.591
make us worthy of thy grace, amen.

48:28.591 --> 48:32.094
Go ahead, Henry. I said grace
for you, too.

48:32.094 --> 48:34.096
God may be a Matter of indifference

48:34.096 --> 48:35.097
to the evolutionists,

48:35.598 --> 48:37.600
and the life beyond hold no charms for them...

48:37.600 --> 48:39.101
[Whispers] Sarah.

48:39.101 --> 48:41.604
[Brady] But the mass of mankind will continue to worship.

48:43.105 --> 48:44.106
Here, sit with me.

48:44.106 --> 48:45.107
Thank you.

48:45.107 --> 48:46.609
He'll be busy for a while.

48:48.110 --> 48:50.112
Well, where is it, where is it

48:50.112 --> 48:51.614
The hat with the little blue feather

48:52.114 --> 48:53.616
Blue feather

48:53.616 --> 48:56.619
You used to wear it to all the conventions. it was much too becoming.

48:56.619 --> 48:59.121
[Chuckling]
Oh, Henry!

48:59.121 --> 49:00.623
And whatever happened

49:00.623 --> 49:03.125
to that skinny black tie you used to wear

49:03.626 --> 49:06.379
Not very attractive... like an old shoelace.

49:07.380 --> 49:09.382
It's back in the shoe.

49:09.882 --> 49:11.884
how are you, Sarah
how are you

49:11.884 --> 49:14.887
a little grayer, Henry. And you

49:14.887 --> 49:16.389
A little grimmer.

49:16.389 --> 49:18.391
I don't believe it. I watched you in court today.

49:18.391 --> 49:21.026
You seemed to be enjoying it as much as ever.

49:21.026 --> 49:24.530
That's Matt. He brings out the worst in me.

49:24.530 --> 49:26.532
We've missed you, Henry.

49:26.532 --> 49:30.035
You don't make many good friends in a lifetime.

49:30.035 --> 49:33.539
I never dreamed our ideas would separate us.

49:34.540 --> 49:36.041
[Brady] I have reason to be.

49:36.041 --> 49:37.543
I have messages of encouragement

49:37.543 --> 49:39.044
from the governors of 22 states.

49:39.044 --> 49:41.046
He still has a loud voice.

49:41.046 --> 49:43.549
He still has something to say, Henry.

49:44.049 --> 49:46.051
You mean about how everybody else should live

49:46.051 --> 49:49.054
Oh, don't be cynical.

49:49.054 --> 49:52.057
I think every man longs to be his brother's keeper

49:52.057 --> 49:55.060
and to be cared for in return.

49:55.561 --> 49:58.063
It sounds more convincing coming from you.

49:58.063 --> 50:00.065
He doesn't have a blue feather in his hat, that's all.

50:00.566 --> 50:01.567
[Chuckling]

50:01.567 --> 50:03.569
You know, looking back,

50:03.569 --> 50:07.072
I don't think Matt would have made a great president,

50:07.072 --> 50:10.075
But I would have voted for him for king..

50:10.075 --> 50:12.578
just to have you for queen.

50:12.578 --> 50:13.946
and what would you have been

50:13.946 --> 50:15.948
Your majesty's loyal opposition.

50:15.948 --> 50:18.834
[Brady] "...of our belief in the written word of the bible.

50:18.834 --> 50:21.837
I believe that Hillsboro..."
Pardon me,

50:21.837 --> 50:23.339
"...will become the shrine

50:23.339 --> 50:25.341
of all" those millions upon millions

50:25.341 --> 50:27.343
"who find a rallying point

50:27.343 --> 50:30.346
"for their expression of God's will."

50:30.846 --> 50:32.848
Now, that's all for today, gentlemen.

50:34.133 --> 50:36.135
Hearken to the word!

50:36.135 --> 50:38.637
Hearken to the word!

50:38.637 --> 50:40.139
The word tells us

50:40.639 --> 50:43.642
that the world was created in 6 days.

50:43.642 --> 50:47.146
In the beginning, the earth
was without form, and void,

50:47.146 --> 50:50.149
and the lord said, "Let there be light."

50:50.149 --> 50:51.150
[Crowd] Yeah! Yeah!

50:51.650 --> 50:53.152
And there was light!

50:53.652 --> 50:54.653
Amen!

50:54.653 --> 50:57.156
And the lord saw the light, and the light saw the lord

50:57.156 --> 50:59.158
And the light said, am I good, lord

50:59.658 --> 51:02.161
And the lord said, thou art good.

51:02.661 --> 51:03.662
[Cheering]

51:04.163 --> 51:07.166
And the evening and the morning
were the 1st day.

51:07.166 --> 51:09.168
and the lord said, "Let there be
a firmament."

51:09.668 --> 51:11.170
And even as he spoke, it was so.

51:12.671 --> 51:15.674
And the evening and the morning were the 2nd day!

51:15.674 --> 51:16.675
On the 3rd day,

51:17.176 --> 51:18.561
Brought he forth the dry land,

51:18.561 --> 51:20.563
and the grass, and the fruit tree,

51:20.563 --> 51:23.566
and on the 4th day, the sun, the moon and the stars,

51:23.566 --> 51:26.318
and he pronounced them good.

51:26.318 --> 51:28.821
The 5th day peopled he the
sea with fish

51:28.821 --> 51:30.322
and the air with fowl,

51:30.322 --> 51:32.825
and made he the great whale,

51:32.825 --> 51:36.328
and he blessed them all!

51:36.328 --> 51:37.830
[Crowd cheering]

51:39.331 --> 51:41.333
But...

51:41.333 --> 51:44.837
on the morning of the 6th day,

51:45.337 --> 51:49.842
the lord rose, and his eye was dark,

51:49.842 --> 51:52.344
and the scowl lay across his face.

51:53.345 --> 51:54.346
Why

51:54.847 --> 51:55.848
Why was the lord troubled

51:56.348 --> 51:57.349
Why tell us!

51:57.349 --> 51:58.851
Tell us the troubles of the lord!

51:59.351 --> 52:00.853
Tell us the troubles of the lord!

52:01.353 --> 52:03.856
The lord looked around him, did the lord, at all his handiwork

52:03.856 --> 52:06.358
Bowed down before him, and he said,

52:06.358 --> 52:08.360
"It is not good! It is not enough!

52:08.360 --> 52:10.362
It is not finished!"

52:10.863 --> 52:13.365
"I shall make me...

52:14.366 --> 52:15.484
a man!"

52:15.484 --> 52:16.986
[Crowd cheering]

52:18.621 --> 52:19.622
Do we believe

52:19.622 --> 52:20.623
[All]
Yes!

52:20.623 --> 52:21.991
Do we believe the word

52:21.991 --> 52:23.125
Yes!

52:23.626 --> 52:24.627
Do we believe the truth of the word

52:24.627 --> 52:25.744
Yes!

52:25.744 --> 52:27.746
Do we curse the man who denies the word

52:27.746 --> 52:28.747
Yes!

52:28.747 --> 52:30.749
Do we call down hellfire

52:30.749 --> 52:32.751
on the man who has sinned against the word

52:32.751 --> 52:34.253
Yes!

52:34.253 --> 52:36.255
Whatever happened to silent prayer

52:36.755 --> 52:40.259
O lord of the tempest and the thunder,

52:40.259 --> 52:42.761
strike down this sinner

52:42.761 --> 52:44.763
as thou did thine enemies of old

52:44.763 --> 52:46.265
in the days of the pharaohs.

52:46.265 --> 52:49.768
Let him know the terror of thy sword!

52:49.768 --> 52:53.772
Let his soul for all eternity

52:53.772 --> 52:57.776
writhe in anguish and damnation!

52:57.776 --> 52:58.777
No!

52:58.777 --> 52:59.778
No, Pa!

53:00.279 --> 53:01.780
Don't pray to destroy Bert!

53:01.780 --> 53:05.284
Lord, we ask the same curse

53:05.284 --> 53:07.786
for those who ask grace for this sinner

53:07.786 --> 53:11.290
though they be blood of my blood
and flesh of my flesh!

53:11.790 --> 53:16.795
Rev. Brown, Rev-
Rev. Brown, I know it's the great zeal of your faith

53:16.795 --> 53:19.298
which makes you utter this prayer,

53:19.298 --> 53:21.550
but it is possible to be overzealous,

53:22.051 --> 53:23.552
to destroy that which you hope to save

53:24.053 --> 53:26.555
so that nothing is left but emptiness.

53:26.555 --> 53:28.057
remember the wisdom of solomon

53:28.057 --> 53:29.558
in the book of proverbs--

53:29.558 --> 53:32.561
"he that troubleth
his own house"

53:32.561 --> 53:35.064
shall inherit the wind."

53:36.565 --> 53:40.069
The bible also tells us that God forgives his children,

53:40.069 --> 53:45.074
and we as children of God should forgive each other

53:45.074 --> 53:48.077
My good friends, return to your homes.

53:49.078 --> 53:50.079
Go home.

53:50.579 --> 53:52.581
The blessings of the lord be with you all.

54:10.349 --> 54:12.351
We'll take you home, my dear.

54:12.351 --> 54:15.354
I can't go home. He hates me.

54:15.354 --> 54:17.356
He doesn't hate you.

54:17.356 --> 54:20.859
He damned me. My own father damned me to hell.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.362
No man has the power to damn.

54:23.362 --> 54:25.364
He's always done it.

54:25.364 --> 54:28.367
He did it to Bert and the little Stebbins boy.

54:29.368 --> 54:31.370
Stebbins boy

54:31.370 --> 54:35.374
That's how the whole thing started.

54:35.374 --> 54:38.377
the Stebbins boy was just an innocent child.

54:38.377 --> 54:40.879
[Mr. Brady] God has no wrath for the innocent, my dear.

54:42.881 --> 54:45.384
That's what Bert said.

54:45.884 --> 54:49.388
He u--he used to say that when we-- when we were together.

54:50.889 --> 54:54.393
I-if I could justexplain it clearly,

54:54.393 --> 54:56.895
then you'd understand.

54:56.895 --> 54:58.397
Mr. Brady, please, I--

54:58.897 --> 55:00.399
We'll do all we can to help you.

55:00.399 --> 55:02.401
Come. Now, let's go home.

55:28.978 --> 55:30.480
I'll be right up, Sarah.

55:30.480 --> 55:31.981
All right, Matt.

55:32.482 --> 55:33.483
Good night, Henry.

55:33.483 --> 55:35.485
[Drummond] good night.

55:46.496 --> 55:47.997
You're up late.

55:48.498 --> 55:49.999
Too hot to sleep.

55:52.001 --> 55:55.004
No use trying to fool ourselves, Henry

55:55.004 --> 55:57.507
We're just not the men we used to be.

55:57.507 --> 55:59.509
Ha ha!

55:59.509 --> 56:02.011
By the size of that meal you packed away tonight,

56:02.011 --> 56:04.013
I'd say you hadn't changed in 40 years.

56:04.514 --> 56:07.016
[Laughing]

56:14.023 --> 56:15.525
Funny how 2 people

56:15.525 --> 56:17.527
can start from the same point and...

56:18.528 --> 56:20.530
drift apart.

56:22.031 --> 56:25.535
It's the nature of the life process.

56:25.535 --> 56:28.037
There used to be a mutuality of understanding and...

56:29.038 --> 56:31.541
admiration between us, Henry.

56:33.543 --> 56:36.546
Why is it, my old friend, that you've...

56:36.546 --> 56:39.048
you've moved so far away from me

56:39.048 --> 56:41.050
Well, all motion is relative, Matt.

56:41.050 --> 56:44.053
Maybe it's you who have moved away by standing still.

56:45.054 --> 56:46.055
Hmm.

56:48.057 --> 56:50.059
If progress means abandoning God

56:51.561 --> 56:53.563
abandoning the faith of our fathers--

56:53.563 --> 56:55.565
I saw a demonstration of that faith tonight.

56:55.565 --> 56:57.567
it's a pretty deadly instrument, I'd say.

56:57.567 --> 56:59.068
What you saw was a reflection

56:59.068 --> 57:00.570
of the violence and hate

57:01.070 --> 57:04.073
in the world around them,
Henry-- your world

57:04.073 --> 57:05.575
But they're driven to it

57:05.575 --> 57:08.077
because their faith was challenged.

57:08.077 --> 57:11.080
These are simple people, Henry, poor people.

57:11.080 --> 57:12.582
they work hard

57:12.582 --> 57:14.083
and they need to believe in something...

57:15.084 --> 57:17.086
something beautiful.

57:17.086 --> 57:18.588
They're seeking for something

57:18.588 --> 57:20.590
more perfect than what they have

57:20.590 --> 57:22.091
Window shopping for heaven.

57:22.592 --> 57:24.093
why do you want to take it away from them, Henry

57:24.093 --> 57:25.595
it's all they have...

57:26.095 --> 57:28.097
like a golden chalice of hope.

57:28.097 --> 57:31.100
[Chuckling] Ah.

57:32.101 --> 57:34.103
Like my golden dancer.

57:36.606 --> 57:37.607
Your what?

57:37.607 --> 57:40.109
Golden dancer.

57:40.109 --> 57:41.611
She stood in the big side window

57:42.111 --> 57:43.613
in the general store in Wakeman, Ohio.

57:44.113 --> 57:46.115
I'd stand out on the street and say to myself,

57:46.115 --> 57:49.619
"if I had golden dancer, I'd have everything in the world I ever wanted."

57:50.119 --> 57:53.122
I was about 7 years old
at the time and a great
judge of rocking horses.

57:55.124 --> 57:58.127
Golden dancer had a bright-red mane, blue eyes,

57:58.127 --> 58:00.630
and she was gold all over with purple spots.

58:01.130 --> 58:02.632
And when the sun hit her stirrups,

58:02.632 --> 58:06.135
She was a dazzling sight to behold.

58:06.135 --> 58:09.138
But she was a week's wages for my father,

58:10.640 --> 58:12.141
So golden dancer and I

58:12.141 --> 58:15.645
always had a big plate-glass window between us.

58:18.648 --> 58:19.649
And then...

58:21.150 --> 58:22.652
Let's see...

58:22.652 --> 58:24.654
It couldn't have been christmas.

58:24.654 --> 58:27.156
It must have been my birthday.

58:27.156 --> 58:28.658
I woke in the morning,

58:28.658 --> 58:30.159
and there was golden dancer

58:30.159 --> 58:31.661
at the foot of my bed.

58:32.161 --> 58:33.663
Mom had skimped on the groceries,

58:33.663 --> 58:36.666
and my father had worked nights for a month.

58:36.666 --> 58:38.167
I jumped into the saddle,

58:38.167 --> 58:40.169
and I started to rock...

58:41.671 --> 58:43.172
and it broke.
No

58:43.172 --> 58:45.675
Split in 2. The wood was rotten.

58:45.675 --> 58:47.677
The whole thing was put together

58:47.677 --> 58:49.679
with spit and sealing wax.

58:50.680 --> 58:53.182
All shine and no substance,

58:53.683 --> 58:57.687
And that's how I feel about that demonstration I saw tonight, Matt--

58:57.687 --> 58:59.188
All glitter and glamour.

58:59.188 --> 59:00.690
You say you're giving the people hope

59:00.690 --> 59:02.191
I think you're stealing their hope.

59:02.692 --> 59:04.060
Oh no, Henry --
[sighing]

59:04.060 --> 59:06.562
As long as the prerequisite for that shining paradise

59:06.562 --> 59:09.065
is ignorance, bigotry, and hate...

59:11.067 --> 59:13.069
I say, "the hell with it."

59:16.572 --> 59:18.074
[Door closing]

59:25.047 --> 59:27.550
We had to keep an open mind on the origin of species.

59:27.550 --> 59:29.051
Very interesting, Howard.

59:29.051 --> 59:30.553
Very interesting.

59:31.554 --> 59:33.055
Now, go on, Howard

59:33.055 --> 59:36.559
tell us what else Mr. Cates told you
in the classroom

59:38.060 --> 59:39.562
Well, he said at first

59:39.562 --> 59:42.064
the earth was too hot for any kind of life.

59:42.064 --> 59:43.566
then it cooled off a mite,

59:43.566 --> 59:45.568
and cells and things began to grow.

59:46.068 --> 59:47.069
cells

59:48.571 --> 59:49.572
Oh...oh!

59:49.572 --> 59:50.573
Mr. McKinnon.

59:50.573 --> 59:52.575
Mr. Galbraith.

59:52.575 --> 59:55.077
I think you know the rest of these gentlemen.

59:59.081 --> 01:00:00.583
[Gavel pounding]

01:00:03.953 --> 01:00:04.954
Ahem.

01:00:06.456 --> 01:00:07.457
Cells, Howard.

01:00:07.957 --> 01:00:09.959
Little bugs, like in the water.

01:00:09.959 --> 01:00:12.462
then the little bugs got to be bigger bugs,

01:00:12.462 --> 01:00:14.464
and sprouted legs and crawled up on the land.

01:00:14.464 --> 01:00:16.966
How long did this take according to Mr. Cates

01:00:16.966 --> 01:00:20.470
Couple million years...maybe longer.

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:22.972
Then comes the fishes and the reptiles and the mammals.

01:00:23.473 --> 01:00:24.474
Man's a mammal.

01:00:24.474 --> 01:00:26.476
Along with the dogs...

01:00:26.476 --> 01:00:27.977
and the cattle in the field

01:00:28.978 --> 01:00:30.480
Did he say that

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.481
Yes, sir.

01:00:33.483 --> 01:00:34.484
Now, Howard,

01:00:34.484 --> 01:00:36.986
How does man come out of this slimy mess

01:00:36.986 --> 01:00:38.488
of bugs and serpents,

01:00:38.488 --> 01:00:40.990
according to your, uh, professor

01:00:42.492 --> 01:00:45.495
Well, man was sort of evoluted...

01:00:45.495 --> 01:00:47.997
from the old-world monkeys.

01:00:47.997 --> 01:00:49.999
Did you hear that, my friends

01:00:49.999 --> 01:00:51.501
old-world monkeys!

01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:52.502
Ha!

01:00:53.002 --> 01:00:54.003
According to Mr. Cates,

01:00:54.003 --> 01:00:55.505
you and I aren't even descended

01:00:55.505 --> 01:00:58.007
from good American monkeys.

01:00:58.007 --> 01:00:59.509
Now Howard, listen, carefully.

01:01:00.009 --> 01:01:03.012
in all this talk of bugs and evolution

01:01:03.513 --> 01:01:06.015
of slime and ooze,

01:01:06.015 --> 01:01:09.018
did Mr. Cates ever make any reference to God

01:01:12.522 --> 01:01:14.023
[Sighing] not as I remember.

01:01:14.023 --> 01:01:17.527
of the miracle he achieved in 7 days

01:01:18.027 --> 01:01:20.530
as described in the beautiful book of genesis

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.531
No, sir.

01:01:22.532 --> 01:01:24.033
Ladies and gentlemen--

01:01:24.033 --> 01:01:26.035
Objection!

01:01:26.035 --> 01:01:28.037
I ask the court to remind the learned counsel

01:01:28.037 --> 01:01:30.039
that he is not in a Chautauqua tent.

01:01:30.039 --> 01:01:32.542
He's supposed to be submitting evidence to a jury.

01:01:32.542 --> 01:01:34.544
There are no ladies on the jury.

01:01:34.544 --> 01:01:38.548
Your honor...I have no intention of making a speech

01:01:40.049 --> 01:01:42.051
there is no need.

01:01:42.552 --> 01:01:45.054
I am sure that everyone on the jury,

01:01:45.555 --> 01:01:47.557
everyone within the sound of this boy's voice

01:01:47.557 --> 01:01:50.059
is moved by his tragic confusion.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.061
He has been taught

01:01:52.061 --> 01:01:54.063
that he wriggled up like an animal

01:01:54.564 --> 01:01:56.566
from the filth and muck below.

01:01:57.066 --> 01:01:58.568
I say that these bible haters,

01:01:58.568 --> 01:02:01.571
these evolutionists, are brewers of poison!

01:02:02.071 --> 01:02:05.074
and the legislature of this sovereign state

01:02:05.074 --> 01:02:06.576
has had the wisdom to demand

01:02:06.576 --> 01:02:09.579
that the peddlers of poison, in bottles or in books,

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:13.082
clearly label the product they attempt to sell.

01:02:13.082 --> 01:02:15.585
I say that if this law is not upheld,

01:02:15.585 --> 01:02:17.587
this boy will become one of a generation

01:02:17.587 --> 01:02:20.590
shorn of its faith by the teachings of godless science!

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:23.593
But, if the full penalty of the law

01:02:23.593 --> 01:02:25.595
is meted out to Bertram Cates,

01:02:25.595 --> 01:02:27.597
the faithful the whole world over

01:02:28.097 --> 01:02:31.601
who are watching us here and listening to our every word

01:02:31.601 --> 01:02:35.104
will rise up and call this courtroom blessed!

01:02:36.606 --> 01:02:38.107
Your witness, Sir.

01:02:47.617 --> 01:02:50.620
I sure am glad the colonel didn't make a speech.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.121
[Laughing]

01:02:53.122 --> 01:02:55.625
Now, Howard...

01:02:55.625 --> 01:02:58.628
I heard you say that the world used to get pretty hot.

01:02:59.128 --> 01:03:01.130
Well, that's what Mr. Cates said.

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:03.132
Any hotter than it is right now, do you think

01:03:04.133 --> 01:03:05.635
Well, I guess it must have been.

01:03:05.635 --> 01:03:07.637
Mr. Cates read it to us from a book.

01:03:08.638 --> 01:03:10.139
This the book

01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:12.642
Charles Darwin's theory

01:03:13.142 --> 01:03:15.645
of the evolution and the descent of man

01:03:16.145 --> 01:03:17.146
Yes, sir.

01:03:17.146 --> 01:03:18.648
That's right, Howard.

01:03:19.649 --> 01:03:21.150
That's the very book

01:03:21.651 --> 01:03:23.152
He read to you in your classroom.

01:03:24.654 --> 01:03:26.155
Now, Howard, tell me,

01:03:28.157 --> 01:03:30.660
do you think there was anything wrong in that

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.162
Well, I don't know

01:03:33.162 --> 01:03:34.664
Objection, your honor.

01:03:35.164 --> 01:03:36.666
The defense is asking that

01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:38.668
a 15-year-old boy hand down an opinion

01:03:38.668 --> 01:03:40.670
on a question of morality.

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:43.172
I am trying to establish that Howard,

01:03:43.172 --> 01:03:45.174
or Col.Brady, or Charles Darwin,

01:03:45.675 --> 01:03:47.677
or anyone sitting in this courtroom, or you, sir,

01:03:48.177 --> 01:03:49.679
has the right to think.

01:03:49.679 --> 01:03:52.181
Col. Drummond, the right to think

01:03:52.181 --> 01:03:55.184
is not on trial here.

01:03:55.184 --> 01:03:57.687
Well, with all due respect to the court, sir,

01:03:57.687 --> 01:03:59.188
I think the right to think

01:03:59.188 --> 01:04:01.691
is very much on trial here...

01:04:01.691 --> 01:04:03.192
and it is fearfully in danger in

01:04:03.192 --> 01:04:04.694
the proceedings of this courtroom.

01:04:05.194 --> 01:04:06.195
A man is on trial!

01:04:06.195 --> 01:04:07.697
A thinking man!

01:04:09.198 --> 01:04:11.200
and he's faced with fine and imprisonment

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.703
because he chooses to speak what he thinks.

01:04:15.204 --> 01:04:16.205
Col. Drummond,

01:04:16.205 --> 01:04:18.708
will you please, ah, rephrase your question

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:22.211
Well now, let's put it this way, Howard--

01:04:22.712 --> 01:04:25.715
all this fuss and feathers about evolution--

01:04:25.715 --> 01:04:27.216
do you think it hurt you any

01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:28.217
Sir

01:04:28.718 --> 01:04:30.720
Did it do you any harm

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.722
Still feel reasonably fit

01:04:33.723 --> 01:04:35.224
what Mr. Cates told you,

01:04:35.224 --> 01:04:38.728
Did it, ah, did it hurt your baseball game any

01:04:38.728 --> 01:04:41.230
did it affect your pitching arm

01:04:41.731 --> 01:04:42.732
No, sir.

01:04:42.732 --> 01:04:44.233
I'm a lefty.

01:04:44.932 --> 01:04:46.934
A south paw, huh

01:04:46.934 --> 01:04:48.936
Still honor your father and your mother

01:04:48.936 --> 01:04:49.937
Sure.

01:04:50.437 --> 01:04:51.939
Haven't murdered anybody since breakfast, have you

01:04:51.939 --> 01:04:52.940
Objection.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.943
This is an absurd piece of jactitation.

01:04:59.446 --> 01:05:00.447
Ahem.

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:04.952
Counsel uses a word

01:05:04.952 --> 01:05:07.454
with which, ah, the bench is not familiar.

01:05:08.455 --> 01:05:09.957
Jactitation--

01:05:09.957 --> 01:05:11.959
A specious or false premise.

01:05:11.959 --> 01:05:13.460
in this instance,

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.462
as to the murder of known or unknown persons.

01:05:16.964 --> 01:05:18.465
Objection
Sustained.

01:05:19.466 --> 01:05:20.968
Ahem.

01:05:20.968 --> 01:05:23.971
Ask him if his faith in the holy scriptures has been shattered.

01:05:26.473 --> 01:05:28.976
When I need your help, Col.Brady,

01:05:28.976 --> 01:05:32.980
you may rest assured I shall humbly ask for it.

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.984
Anytime, Col. Drummond, anytime.

01:05:36.984 --> 01:05:38.485
He's the only man I know

01:05:38.485 --> 01:05:39.987
who can strut sitting down.

01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:44.491
Now, Howard, tell me something--

01:05:44.992 --> 01:05:46.994
did you believe everything Mr. Cates told you

01:05:47.995 --> 01:05:49.496
I'm not sure.

01:05:49.997 --> 01:05:50.998
I gotta think about it.

01:05:50.998 --> 01:05:52.499
Good for you.
Good for you.

01:05:54.501 --> 01:05:57.004
Now, uh, uh, your Pa's a farmer, isn't he

01:05:57.504 --> 01:05:58.005
Yes, sir.

01:05:58.005 --> 01:05:59.506
Got a tractor

01:05:59.506 --> 01:06:00.507
Brand-new one.

01:06:00.507 --> 01:06:03.010
You think there's anything sinful about a tractor

01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:05.012
because it isn't mentioned in the bible

01:06:05.512 --> 01:06:06.513
No.

01:06:06.513 --> 01:06:09.016
You know, Moses never made a phone call.

01:06:09.516 --> 01:06:11.018
You figure that makes the telephone

01:06:11.518 --> 01:06:14.021
an instrument of the devil

01:06:14.021 --> 01:06:15.022
I never thought of it that way.

01:06:15.522 --> 01:06:17.524
Neither did anybody else!

01:06:18.025 --> 01:06:20.527
Your honor, the defense makes the same old error

01:06:20.527 --> 01:06:22.529
of all godless men--

01:06:22.529 --> 01:06:24.531
he confuses material things

01:06:24.531 --> 01:06:28.535
with the great spiritual value of the revealed word.

01:06:28.535 --> 01:06:30.537
Why do you bewilder this child

01:06:30.537 --> 01:06:33.423
Does right have no meaning to you, sir

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:36.426
Realizing that I may prejudice the case of my client,

01:06:36.927 --> 01:06:37.928
I must tell you

01:06:37.928 --> 01:06:40.931
that right has no meaning for me whatsoever.

01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:42.432
[Murmuring]

01:06:45.685 --> 01:06:48.805
But truth has meaning...as a direction!

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:52.809
But...

01:06:52.809 --> 01:06:56.813
it is one of the peculiar imbecilities of our time

01:06:56.813 --> 01:07:00.817
that we place a grid of morality upon human behavior

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:03.320
so that the action of every man

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.322
must be measured against a...

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:07.324
an arbitrary latitude of right

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:08.825
and a longitude of wrong

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:13.330
in exact minutes, degrees, and seconds, so...

01:07:19.336 --> 01:07:21.338
Howard, do you know what the heck...

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:23.340
do you understand what I'm talking about

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.841
No, sir.

01:07:26.343 --> 01:07:28.345
Maybe someday you will.

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:29.346
That's all, son.

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:30.847
Thank you. you're excused.

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:32.849
This boy may not
understand, but I do.

01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:34.851
I've seen what you can do to a jury--

01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:36.353
twist and tangle them.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.355
Nobody's forgotten the Endicott publishing case,

01:07:38.355 --> 01:07:41.358
where you made the jury believe the obscenity was in their own minds

01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:42.859
It was immoral, what you did to the jury.

01:07:42.859 --> 01:07:44.861
tricking them, judgment by confusion.

01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:46.363
you think you can get away with it here

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:49.366
I'm not trying to get away with anything!

01:07:49.366 --> 01:07:51.868
I am simply trying to prevent the clock-stoppers

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:54.371
from dumping a lot of medieval nonsense

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:57.541
into the United States constitution.

01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:59.543
this is not a federal court, Col. Drummond.

01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:01.545
Well, damn it, you have to start from somewhere!

01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:03.547
Your honor, it's obvious what he's trying to do--

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:05.549
he is trying to make us forget the lawbreaker

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:07.551
and put the law on trial

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:10.053
Well, we have the answer for you in our next witness.

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:12.939
Call miss Rachel Brown to the stand.

01:08:12.939 --> 01:08:14.441
[Bailiff] Rachel Brown!

01:08:14.441 --> 01:08:17.444
[Clerk] Rachel Brown, come to the stand, please!

01:08:18.444 --> 01:08:20.947
Did you know about this

01:08:21.448 --> 01:08:23.450
He didn't, but we should have.

01:08:25.452 --> 01:08:26.453
Rach

01:08:28.955 --> 01:08:30.457
Rach, what did you tell him

01:08:30.457 --> 01:08:32.459
Take it easy, son.

01:08:40.466 --> 01:08:41.468
Sit down, Samson.

01:08:41.468 --> 01:08:43.470
You're about to get a haircut.

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:45.971
Rachel, do you solemnly swear

01:08:45.971 --> 01:08:47.474
the testimony you're about to give

01:08:47.974 --> 01:08:50.477
is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

01:08:50.477 --> 01:08:51.478
so help you God

01:08:51.978 --> 01:08:52.979
I do.

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:54.981
Now, my dear,

01:08:55.482 --> 01:08:56.983
I just want you to repeat

01:08:56.983 --> 01:08:58.984
some of the things you told me last night.

01:08:59.486 --> 01:09:01.488
Please, Mr. Brady...

01:09:01.488 --> 01:09:04.491
Rachel, didn't you say you wanted the people here to understand

01:09:04.491 --> 01:09:06.493
Yes.
Then just answer my question.

01:09:07.493 --> 01:09:08.995
Now, Miss Brown,

01:09:08.995 --> 01:09:11.997
you are an old friend of the efendant, Bertram Cates

01:09:12.999 --> 01:09:15.502
We're...we're engaged to be married.

01:09:15.502 --> 01:09:17.504
Do you and Mr. Cates attend the same church

01:09:17.504 --> 01:09:20.006
Yes...we did.

01:09:20.506 --> 01:09:22.008
Do you now

01:09:22.509 --> 01:09:23.510
What?

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:25.011
Attend the same church

01:09:26.513 --> 01:09:27.514
No.

01:09:28.014 --> 01:09:30.015
Did Mr. Cates leave the church

01:09:31.017 --> 01:09:32.519
No, not really.

01:09:33.019 --> 01:09:34.020
Not the spirit of it.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.523
But the body of it, correct

01:09:36.523 --> 01:09:39.024
Mr. Cates left the church

01:09:39.024 --> 01:09:41.528
you and he once attended together

01:09:41.528 --> 01:09:42.529
Yes.
Why

01:09:45.031 --> 01:09:46.032
Because of the Stebbins boy.

01:09:46.533 --> 01:09:48.535
The Stebbins boy.

01:09:48.535 --> 01:09:50.537
Would you tell us about that, please

01:09:51.037 --> 01:09:52.906
It was 2 summers ago.

01:09:53.406 --> 01:09:56.409
The little Stebbins boy was 13 years old.

01:09:56.409 --> 01:09:58.411
He was one of Bert's students.

01:09:58.912 --> 01:10:00.914
He lived right next door to the boarding house,

01:10:00.914 --> 01:10:01.915
and he used to come over

01:10:02.415 --> 01:10:05.051
And look through
Bert's microscope.

01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:07.554
Bert said the boy had a bright mind

01:10:07.554 --> 01:10:10.056
and--and he might even be a scientist when he grew up.

01:10:10.557 --> 01:10:11.558
Yes

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.063
He--he went to the river with the other boys a-and went swimming.

01:10:18.315 --> 01:10:19.816
He...

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:22.319
he got a cramp...
and drowned.

01:10:25.939 --> 01:10:26.940
Go on.

01:10:28.942 --> 01:10:30.944
At the funeral,

01:10:30.944 --> 01:10:34.447
Pa preached that tommy didn't die in a state of grace

01:10:34.447 --> 01:10:37.450
because... because his father wouldn't allow him

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:38.952
to be baptized.

01:10:38.952 --> 01:10:40.954
Tell him what your father really said,

01:10:40.954 --> 01:10:43.456
that tommy's soul was damned, writhing in hellfire!

01:10:43.456 --> 01:10:46.343
Cates, you sinner!

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:48.345
Religion's supposed to comfort people,

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:50.347
Not frighten them to death!

01:10:50.347 --> 01:10:51.348
[Crowd murmuring]

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:53.350
[Gavel pounding]

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:54.851
We will have order, please.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.353
Now, sit down, Bert.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:57.354
Don't you see

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:58.855
Bert thought it wasn't fair

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:01.358
that a little child couldn't go to heaven!

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.361
It wasn't God he abandoned, only the church!

01:11:04.361 --> 01:11:05.362
Very well, my dear. It is true, then,

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:08.365
that because of what happened to the Stebbins boy,

01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:10.367
Bert Cates left the church!

01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:12.869
We've said nothing wrong.

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:15.372
We are merely beginning to gain some insight

01:11:15.372 --> 01:11:19.125
into the experiences that sometimes will lead a young man astray.

01:11:19.125 --> 01:11:20.627
Objection!

01:11:20.627 --> 01:11:22.128
Whether my client went astray

01:11:22.629 --> 01:11:24.130
is a Matter of interpretation.

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:25.632
Strike it from the record.

01:11:25.632 --> 01:11:26.633
Objection sustained.

01:11:27.133 --> 01:11:28.134
The jury is directed

01:11:28.134 --> 01:11:30.637
to disregard the remarks of counsel.

01:11:30.637 --> 01:11:32.639
Very well.

01:11:32.639 --> 01:11:35.141
Now, my dear, will you tell the jury

01:11:35.141 --> 01:11:37.143
some more of Mr. Cates' opinions

01:11:37.143 --> 01:11:38.895
on the subject of religion

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:40.897
Objection!

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:42.899
Hearsay evidence is not admissible.

01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:45.902
The court sees no objection to this line of questioning.

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:47.404
Proceed, Col. Brady.

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:49.906
Just repeat, in your own words, some of the conversations

01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:51.908
you had with the defendant.

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:53.410
Rachel, you can't.

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.911
The things I said to you

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:56.913
were questions-- questions you ask your own heart.

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:58.915
If you say those things out loud,

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:00.417
he'll make them sound like answers.

01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:01.418
I--I can't.

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:04.421
You won't hurt him, Rachel. This
is for his good.

01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:05.922
Speak up.

01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:07.924
Mr. Brady, I confided in you--

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:10.427
Well, we're here to serve the truth, Rachel, only the truth.

01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:13.930
I can't remember.

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:16.433
Rachel, you are testifying under oath.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:19.936
It is unlawful to withhold pertinent information.

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:22.439
Describe to the court your innermost feelings

01:12:22.439 --> 01:12:24.441
when Bert Cates said to you,

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:27.944
"God did not create man. Man created god."

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:29.446
Bert didn't say that!

01:12:29.946 --> 01:12:30.947
He was just bitter

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:32.949
because of the little Stebbins boy!

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:34.951
He said man created a vengeful god

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:36.453
out of his own bigotry

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:37.954
and the devil out of his own hell!

01:12:38.455 --> 01:12:40.457
And when he wondered what's on the other side of the moon,

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:43.460
did he ever mention the possibility of heaven did he

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.462
or did he say there was nothing

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:48.465
but a world of stars, moons, galaxies, and universal dust

01:12:48.465 --> 01:12:49.966
Tell us, tell us some more.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.968
What'd he say about the holy state of matrimony

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:53.470
Did he compare it to animal breeding

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:54.971
[Drummond] Objection!

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:57.474
You want the good people of this town

01:12:57.474 --> 01:12:58.975
to see what happened to his brain

01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:01.478
so they can help bring him back to his senses, don't ya

01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:04.481
Tell it! Tell it all!
Tell it! Tell it! Tell it!

01:13:04.481 --> 01:13:05.482
Matt!

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:07.484
[Sobbing]

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:14.991
Under the circumstances...

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:19.996
I believe the witness... should be excused.

01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:28.505
Col. Drummond, do you have any objection

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:30.006
to excusing the witness

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:32.509
from cross- examination at this time,

01:13:32.509 --> 01:13:34.260
subject to later recall

01:13:34.761 --> 01:13:36.763
Well, your honor, the defense must have a chance

01:13:36.763 --> 01:13:38.264
to challenge the words

01:13:38.264 --> 01:13:40.767
put into the mouth of the witness by the prosecutor.

01:13:41.768 --> 01:13:43.269
Don't plague her. Let her go.

01:13:44.771 --> 01:13:47.273
Uh, may I have a moment

01:13:47.273 --> 01:13:49.776
Do you want every word he just put in her mouth

01:13:50.276 --> 01:13:51.277
to go in to the record

01:13:51.277 --> 01:13:53.279
It's not that important.

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.782
Not th-- he just pulled you apart like a plucked chicken.

01:13:56.282 --> 01:13:57.784
Please, do as I say. You've got to.

01:13:57.784 --> 01:13:58.785
I've got to what

01:13:58.785 --> 01:14:00.286
send you to jail

01:14:00.286 --> 01:14:01.287
Let her go.

01:14:01.788 --> 01:14:03.289
You all-American idiot,

01:14:03.289 --> 01:14:05.792
She just handed them your head on a silver platter.

01:14:05.792 --> 01:14:07.293
Damn it, stay out of this!

01:14:07.293 --> 01:14:09.295
It's none of your business.

01:14:09.295 --> 01:14:11.297
Don't tie my hands, son.

01:14:12.799 --> 01:14:15.301
Let her go, or I'll change my plea to guilty.

01:14:22.809 --> 01:14:24.310
No questions.

01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:30.800
For the time being, the witness is excused.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.815
May I have your autograph

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:52.822
[Judge] Does the, uh, prosecution wish to call any further witnesses

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.826
Not, uh, not at the present time, your honor.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.578
The prosecution rests.

01:14:58.578 --> 01:15:01.080
We shall proceed with the case for the defense,

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.082
Col. Drummond.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:05.585
I'd like to call Dr. Amos Keller...

01:15:06.586 --> 01:15:08.588
the head of the department of zoology

01:15:08.588 --> 01:15:09.589
at the University of Chicago.

01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:11.090
Objection!

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:12.592
On what grounds

01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:15.595
I wish to inquire what possible relevance

01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:18.097
the testimony of a zoology professor

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:19.599
can have in this trial

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:21.601
Why, it has every relevance.

01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:24.604
My client is on trial for teaching evolution.

01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:26.105
Certainly any testimony relating to

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:28.107
his so-called infringement of the law

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:29.108
must be admitted.

01:15:29.609 --> 01:15:31.611
Irrelevant, immaterial, inadmissible.

01:15:31.611 --> 01:15:33.112
But why

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:35.615
if Bertram Cates were on trial for murder,

01:15:35.615 --> 01:15:37.617
would it be irrelevant to call in witnesses

01:15:37.617 --> 01:15:39.118
to examine the weapon

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:40.620
would it rule out testimony

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:42.622
that the so-called murder weapon

01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:44.624
was incapable of firing a bullet

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:48.127
I fail to grasp, ah, the learned counsel's meaning.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:49.128
Oh.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:52.131
Uh, well, your honor,

01:15:52.632 --> 01:15:55.134
The defense wishes to place Dr. Keller on the stand

01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:59.138
so that he can explain to the gentlemen of the jury

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:02.642
ah, the exact meaning of the theory of evolution.

01:16:02.642 --> 01:16:05.645
How can they pass judgment if they don't know what it's all about

01:16:05.645 --> 01:16:08.147
I hold that the very law we're here to enforce

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:10.650
excludes such testimony!

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:12.652
The people of this state have made it very clear

01:16:13.152 --> 01:16:15.655
that they do not want this zoological hogwash

01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:17.657
slopping around the schoolrooms,

01:16:17.657 --> 01:16:21.160
and I refuse to allow these agnostic scientists

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.163
to employ this courtroom as a sounding board

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:25.665
as a platform

01:16:25.665 --> 01:16:26.666
from which they can shout their heresies

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:28.167
into the headlines

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:32.672
Col. Drummond,

01:16:32.672 --> 01:16:36.175
the bench rules that zoology is irrelevant to the case.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.928
Agnostic scientists

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:44.934
Ahem.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:47.437
I call Dr. Allen Page,

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.939
deacon of the congregational church

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:51.941
and professor of geology and archaeology

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:52.942
at Oberlin College.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:53.943
Objection.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.946
Objection sustained.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:58.948
Uh, does your honor deny in one breath

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:03.336
The existence of zoology, geology and archaeology

01:17:03.336 --> 01:17:06.339
we do not deny the existence of these sciences,

01:17:06.339 --> 01:17:09.459
but they do not relate to this point of law.

01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:15.965
[Sighing]

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.468
I call Walter Aaronson,

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:21.471
anthropologist, philosopher, author,

01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:24.474
and one of the most brilliant minds in the world today. Any objection

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:25.975
Objection!

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:28.478
Your honor, the defense has brought to Hillsboro,

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:32.482
at great expense and great inconvenience, 6 noted scientists.

01:17:32.482 --> 01:17:34.484
their testimony is basic

01:17:34.484 --> 01:17:36.486
to the defense of my client...

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.489
for I intend to show this court

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:42.992
that what Bertram Cates spoke quietly one spring morning

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:45.995
in the Hillsboro high school is no crime.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.498
It is incontrovertible as geometry

01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:51.501
to any enlightened community of minds.

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:53.002
in this community, Col. Drummond,

01:17:53.503 --> 01:17:55.004
and in this sovereign state,

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.006
exactly the opposite is the case.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:59.008
The language of the law is clear, your honor.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:00.510
We do not need experts

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:03.012
to question the validity of a law already on the books.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:06.516
Well, what do you need a gallows to hang him from.

01:18:06.516 --> 01:18:09.018
That remark is an insult to this entire community.

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:12.021
And this community is an insult to the world!

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:14.524
[Crowd murmuring]

01:18:14.524 --> 01:18:17.527
Your honor, I request permission to withdraw from this case.

01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:20.530
Mr. Drummond, you can't quit now!

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:22.532
Why not you were ready to 5 minutes ago!

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:25.168
Col. Drummond,

01:18:25.668 --> 01:18:28.171
What reasons canyou possibly have

01:18:28.171 --> 01:18:31.174
Well, there are 200 of them!

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:33.676
And if that's not enough, there's one more--

01:18:33.676 --> 01:18:37.680
I think my client has already been found guilty.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.685
Is Mr. Drummond saying that this expression of an honest emotion

01:18:42.685 --> 01:18:44.187
will in any way influence

01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:46.689
the court's impartial
administration of the law

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:51.194
I say that you cannot administer
a wicked law impartially.

01:18:51.194 --> 01:18:53.696
You can only destroy.
You can only punish.

01:18:53.696 --> 01:18:54.947
And I warn you

01:18:55.448 --> 01:18:56.949
that a wicked law, like cholera,

01:18:57.450 --> 01:18:59.452
destroys everyone it touches,

01:18:59.452 --> 01:19:01.454
its upholders as well as its defiers.

01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:02.955
[Judge] Col. Drummond--

01:19:02.955 --> 01:19:05.458
Can't you understand...

01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:07.460
that if you take a law like evolution

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:09.962
and you make it a crime to
teach it in the public schools,

01:19:09.962 --> 01:19:11.464
tomorrow you can make it a crime

01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:13.466
to teach it in the private schools

01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:16.469
and tomorrow you may make it a
crime to read about it

01:19:16.969 --> 01:19:19.972
and soon you may ban
books and newspapers.

01:19:19.972 --> 01:19:22.975
and then you may turn
catholic against protestant

01:19:23.476 --> 01:19:25.478
and protestant against protestant

01:19:25.478 --> 01:19:27.480
and try to foist your own religion

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.981
upon the mind of man!

01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:30.983
If you can do one, you can do the other!

01:19:30.983 --> 01:19:34.987
Because fanaticism and ignorance
is forever busy

01:19:35.488 --> 01:19:36.989
and needs feeding.

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:39.992
and soon, your honor...

01:19:40.993 --> 01:19:45.498
with banners flying and with drums beating,

01:19:45.498 --> 01:19:50.002
we'll be marching backward!
Backward!

01:19:50.002 --> 01:19:54.006
Through the glorious ages of that 16th century

01:19:54.006 --> 01:19:57.009
when bigots burned the man who dared bring

01:19:57.009 --> 01:20:00.012
enlightenment and intelligence to the human mind.

01:20:02.882 --> 01:20:05.384
I hope counsel does not mean to imply

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:06.886
that this court is bigoted.

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.388
Well, your honor has the right to hope.

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.390
I have the right to do more than that.

01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:13.893
You have the power to do more than that!

01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:16.395
And I exercise that power.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:18.397
Col. Drummond, I order you to show cause

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:19.899
tomorrow morning at 10:00

01:20:19.899 --> 01:20:22.535
Why you should not be held in contempt
of this court.

01:20:22.535 --> 01:20:24.036
And in the meanwhile, I order that you be held

01:20:24.537 --> 01:20:26.038
in custody of the bailiff.

01:20:26.539 --> 01:20:28.541
bail is fixed at $2,000.

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:30.042
$2,000--

01:20:31.544 --> 01:20:33.296
Why don't you make it $4,000

01:20:34.297 --> 01:20:36.165
It's $4,000, Col. Drummond.

01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:39.669
Your honor, my paper will post the bond.

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:41.671
Can you prove legal authorization

01:20:41.671 --> 01:20:44.674
to make such a commitment for your employer

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:46.676
Well, I'll wire my paper immediately.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.678
Fine. Until then,

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:50.680
Col. Drummond can avail himself

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.065
of our municipal accommodations.

01:20:53.065 --> 01:20:54.567
[Crowd murmuring]

01:20:57.570 --> 01:20:59.071
Your honor

01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:01.073
your honor, sir

01:21:01.073 --> 01:21:04.076
I'll put up my farm for Mr. Drummond.

01:21:04.076 --> 01:21:05.578
[Judge] We have no way of ascertaining

01:21:05.578 --> 01:21:07.580
the value of your farm, sir.

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.699
it ought to be worth that much.

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:13.703
The law demands that bond be posted in cash.

01:21:13.703 --> 01:21:16.706
Your honor, my bank will honor the offer

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:19.208
on the security of this farm.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:22.211
He has considerably more equity in it than that.

01:21:22.712 --> 01:21:23.713
Ahem.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:26.599
Very well.

01:21:26.599 --> 01:21:28.601
you can make arrangements with the court clerk.

01:21:31.604 --> 01:21:33.105
Who are you

01:21:33.105 --> 01:21:35.608
my name is John Stebbins.

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:38.611
[Judge] Court will adjourn

01:21:39.111 --> 01:21:41.113
and reconvene at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

01:21:48.988 --> 01:21:50.990
We'll hang Bert Cates

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:53.492
to a sour apple tree

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:55.494
We'll hang Bert Cates

01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:57.997
to a sour apple tree

01:21:57.997 --> 01:21:59.999
We'll hang Bert Cates

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:02.501
to a sour apple tree

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:07.006
Our god is marching on

01:22:08.007 --> 01:22:11.510
glory, glory hallelujah

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:14.513
glory, glory hallelujah...

01:22:19.018 --> 01:22:21.020
She'll sleep all right tonight.

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:24.023
Give her these pills tomorrow

01:22:24.023 --> 01:22:26.025
and keep her in bed.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.029
Thank you, John.

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:36.035
Rachel

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:40.039
Rachel

01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:47.046
We'll hang Bert Cates

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:49.548
to a sour apple tree

01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:54.053
our god is marching on

01:22:54.804 --> 01:22:59.308
glory, glory hallelujah

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:03.813
glory, glory hallelujah

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:08.067
glory, glory hallelujah

01:23:08.067 --> 01:23:12.571
His truth is marching on

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:15.074
We'll hang Bert Cates

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:17.576
to a sour apple tree

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:19.712
We'll hang Bert Cates

01:23:19.712 --> 01:23:22.214
to a sour apple tree

01:23:22.214 --> 01:23:24.216
We'll hang Bert Cates

01:23:24.717 --> 01:23:26.719
to a sour apple tree

01:23:26.719 --> 01:23:31.340
our god is marching on

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.843
We'll hang Henry Drummond

01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:36.345
to a sour apple tree

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:38.848
We'll hang Henry Drummond

01:23:38.848 --> 01:23:40.850
to a sour apple tree

01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:43.352
We'll hang Henry Drummond

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:45.855
to a sour apple tree

01:23:45.855 --> 01:23:47.356
Our god is...

01:23:48.741 --> 01:23:50.242
[Knocking at door]

01:23:51.243 --> 01:23:55.748
glory, glory hallelujah

01:23:55.748 --> 01:24:00.252
glory, glory hallelujah

01:24:00.252 --> 01:24:04.256
glory, glory hallelujah

01:24:04.256 --> 01:24:08.260
His truth is marching on...

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:09.261
trick or treat.

01:24:09.762 --> 01:24:11.764
Oh, for Pete's sake.

01:24:12.264 --> 01:24:14.266
Hooligans of the world, unite!

01:24:15.768 --> 01:24:17.269
You've got nothing to burn

01:24:17.269 --> 01:24:19.271
but your intellectuals.

01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:22.274
Well, those are the boobs that make our laws.

01:24:22.274 --> 01:24:24.276
It's a democratic process.

01:24:24.777 --> 01:24:27.279
Well, I suppos e you have something better to suggest.

01:24:27.279 --> 01:24:29.281
We'll hang Henry Drummond

01:24:29.281 --> 01:24:31.901
to a sour apple tree...

01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:34.403
Looks like you're going out

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:36.906
in a blaze of glory, counselor.

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:39.909
Well...

01:24:39.909 --> 01:24:41.410
you were pretty impressive

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.913
for a while there today, Henry.

01:24:43.913 --> 01:24:46.415
"your honor, after a while

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:48.417
you'll be setting" man against man,

01:24:48.918 --> 01:24:51.420
"creed against creed, et cetera, et cetera,

01:24:51.921 --> 01:24:53.422
ad nauseam."

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.925
Aw, Henry, why don't you wake up

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:57.927
Darwin was wrong.

01:24:57.927 --> 01:24:59.929
man's still an ape,

01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:02.932
and his creed's still a totem pole

01:25:02.932 --> 01:25:04.934
when he first achieved
the upright position,

01:25:04.934 --> 01:25:06.435
he took a look at the stars--

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:08.437
thought they were something to eat.

01:25:08.938 --> 01:25:09.939
When he couldn't reach them,

01:25:09.939 --> 01:25:11.440
he decided they were groceries

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.442
belonging to a bigger creature.

01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:17.446
that's how Jehovah was born.

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:19.949
I wish I had your worm's-eye view of history.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:22.451
It would certainly make things a lot easier.

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:24.954
Oh-oh, no! Not for you!

01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:27.456
No, no, you--you'd still be spending your time

01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:28.457
trying to make sense

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:30.459
out of what is laughingly referred to

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:32.461
as the human race.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:34.964
Why don't you take your blinders off

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:37.967
Don't you know the future's already obsolete

01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:40.970
You think man still has a noble destiny.

01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:43.472
Well, I tell you, he's already started

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:44.974
on his backward march

01:25:44.974 --> 01:25:47.977
to the salt and stupid sea from which he came.

01:25:47.977 --> 01:25:49.979
What about men like Bert Cates

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.481
Cates

01:25:54.984 --> 01:25:57.486
The monkey who tried to fly

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.488
Cates climbed to the top of the totem pole

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:01.490
but...then he jumped,

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.994
and there was nobody there to catch him--

01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:06.495
not even you.

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.496
You were there.

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:10.499
You saw what they did to my witnesses.

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:12.501
What you need is a drink.

01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:14.503
What I need is a miracle.

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:16.005
A miracle

01:26:16.005 --> 01:26:18.007
Here's a whole bagful--

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:22.011
courtesy Matthew Harrison Brady.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.046
Your honor...

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:05.554
Your honor, I, uh...

01:27:06.055 --> 01:27:07.056
I feel I owe you an apology.

01:27:07.056 --> 01:27:09.558
Any remarks leading up to the contempt citation

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:10.559
I regret very much.

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:13.062
I realize your honor is trying to be fair and

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:17.066
I, uh... I'm very sorry for any remarks

01:27:17.066 --> 01:27:19.068
that were made in the heat of the moment.

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:22.571
My friends...

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.073
Col. Drummond...

01:27:24.073 --> 01:27:26.075
the man that I believe came into the world

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:28.077
to save mankind from sin

01:27:28.077 --> 01:27:31.080
taught that it was godly to forgive.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.215
I believe in those principles.

01:27:33.215 --> 01:27:35.718
I accept Col. Drummond's apology.

01:27:35.718 --> 01:27:38.220
I withdraw the contempt citation.

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:39.221
Thank you, your honor.

01:27:39.221 --> 01:27:40.222
I, too, should like to add

01:27:40.222 --> 01:27:41.724
that in the spirit of forgiveness,

01:27:42.224 --> 01:27:44.226
I feel no animosity toward learned counsel

01:27:44.226 --> 01:27:45.728
from Chicago.

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:48.731
He is well known to have ridden hobbyhorses before

01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:50.232
perhaps he'll return to his home

01:27:50.232 --> 01:27:51.734
having learned a lesson.

01:27:51.734 --> 01:27:53.235
We commend him to learn in his heart

01:27:53.235 --> 01:27:54.737
the words of him who said,

01:27:54.737 --> 01:27:56.739
"if you thirst, come unto me,

01:27:56.739 --> 01:27:58.240
"and I will give you life."

01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:02.244
That's why he hasn't an enemy in the world--

01:28:02.244 --> 01:28:04.246
only his friends hate him.

01:28:06.749 --> 01:28:08.250
Ahem.

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:10.252
Perhaps, ah, there is much to learn

01:28:10.252 --> 01:28:12.755
from the learned counsel for the prosecution.

01:28:13.255 --> 01:28:16.258
Your honor, there were some remarks I made, ah, yesterday, ah,

01:28:16.258 --> 01:28:18.260
namely that I wish to withdraw from the case.

01:28:18.761 --> 01:28:19.762
If it please the court,

01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:21.263
I shall like to withdraw my withdrawal

01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:23.766
and continue as counsel for Bertram Cates.

01:28:23.766 --> 01:28:25.267
[Judge] I see no reason why Col.Drummond

01:28:25.768 --> 01:28:28.270
should not continue as counsel for the defense.

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:29.271
Proceed, Col. Drummond.

01:28:29.271 --> 01:28:31.273
Thank you,
Thank you.

01:28:31.273 --> 01:28:34.276
Your honor, the court, ah, has ruled out any evidence

01:28:34.276 --> 01:28:37.780
as to scientific knowledge or the Darwinian theory.

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.783
would the court admit evidence--

01:28:40.783 --> 01:28:42.284
expert evidence--

01:28:42.284 --> 01:28:44.787
on a book known as the holy bible

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:48.907
Ahem.

01:28:48.907 --> 01:28:50.409
Any objection, Col. Brady

01:28:52.294 --> 01:28:55.798
If counsel can advance the case for the defendant

01:28:55.798 --> 01:28:57.800
through the use of the holy scriptures,

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.803
the prosecution will take no exception.

01:29:00.803 --> 01:29:03.305
Good. I call to the stand

01:29:03.305 --> 01:29:05.307
one of the world's foremost experts

01:29:05.307 --> 01:29:08.310
on the bible and its teachings--

01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:10.312
Matthew Harrison Brady.

01:29:10.312 --> 01:29:11.814
[Crowd mumbling, judge banging gavel]

01:29:11.814 --> 01:29:13.816
Your honor, this is preposterous!

01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:16.435
Brother, let us pray.

01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:17.936
Well,

01:29:17.936 --> 01:29:19.938
it's highly unorthodox

01:29:20.439 --> 01:29:21.940
I've never known an instance

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.577
where the defense called the prosecuting
attorney as a witness.

01:29:25.577 --> 01:29:27.579
Your honor, this entire trial

01:29:27.579 --> 01:29:29.081
is unorthodox...

01:29:30.582 --> 01:29:32.084
but if the interests

01:29:32.084 --> 01:29:35.087
of right and justice will be served,

01:29:35.087 --> 01:29:36.088
I will take the stand.

01:29:36.088 --> 01:29:38.090
But, Col.Brady...

01:29:39.208 --> 01:29:40.209
the court will support you

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:42.711
if you wish to decline to testify

01:29:42.711 --> 01:29:44.713
as a witness against your own case.

01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:46.215
Your honor,

01:29:46.215 --> 01:29:49.718
I shall not testify against anything.

01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:52.221
I shall speak out as I have all my life

01:29:52.221 --> 01:29:55.724
on behalf of the living truth of the holy scriptures.

01:30:00.479 --> 01:30:01.480
Col. Brady--
no, no, no.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.982
That won't be necessary to swear him in.

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:05.484
Oh, I can make affirmation.

01:30:05.484 --> 01:30:08.487
I have no objection to swearing to God.

01:30:08.487 --> 01:30:12.491
[Chuckling] No. I take it you will tell the truth.

01:30:12.491 --> 01:30:15.494
Now, sir, I-I-I am right
in calling upon you

01:30:15.494 --> 01:30:18.497
as an authority on-- on the bible, am I not

01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:21.500
I believe it is not boastful to say

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.503
that I have studied the bible as much as any layman,

01:30:24.503 --> 01:30:25.504
and I have tried to live

01:30:26.004 --> 01:30:27.506
according to its precepts.

01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:29.007
Bully for you.

01:30:29.007 --> 01:30:31.009
Now, I suppose you can quote me chapter and verse

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:33.011
Right straight through the King James version.

01:30:33.011 --> 01:30:35.013
There are many portions of the holy bible

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:36.515
that I have committed to memory.

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:40.018
I don't suppose there are many portions of this book

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:41.019
you've committed to memory--

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.521
the origin of the species.

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:44.022
I am not the least interested

01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:46.024
in the pagan hypotheses of that book.

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:47.526
[Drummond] Never read it

01:30:47.526 --> 01:30:48.660
and I never will.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:51.163
Then how in perdition have you got the gall

01:30:51.163 --> 01:30:52.664
to whoop up this holy war

01:30:52.664 --> 01:30:54.666
about something you don't know anything about

01:30:54.666 --> 01:30:57.169
How can you be so cocksure

01:30:57.169 --> 01:30:59.671
that the body of scientific knowledge

01:30:59.671 --> 01:31:02.174
systematized in the writings of Charles Darwin

01:31:02.174 --> 01:31:04.676
is in any way irreconcilable

01:31:04.676 --> 01:31:07.679
with the book of genesis

01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:09.681
Would you state that question again, please

01:31:11.683 --> 01:31:13.185
Well now, let me put it this way.

01:31:15.187 --> 01:31:17.689
On page 10 of the origin of the species,

01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:18.690
Darwin states--

01:31:19.191 --> 01:31:21.193
I object to this, your honor.

01:31:21.193 --> 01:31:22.194
Col. Brady has been called

01:31:22.694 --> 01:31:24.196
as an authority on the bible.

01:31:24.196 --> 01:31:26.198
now the, ah... gentleman from Chicago

01:31:26.198 --> 01:31:27.699
is using this opportunity

01:31:27.699 --> 01:31:29.701
to read into the record scientific testimony

01:31:29.701 --> 01:31:31.203
which you, your honor,

01:31:31.203 --> 01:31:32.704
have previously ruled irrelevant.

01:31:32.704 --> 01:31:35.707
If he's going to examine Col. Brady on the bible,

01:31:35.707 --> 01:31:36.708
let him stick to the bible,

01:31:36.708 --> 01:31:40.829
the holy bible and only the bible.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:43.332
You will, uh, confine your questions to the bible.

01:31:47.336 --> 01:31:48.337
All right.

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:49.838
Forget it.

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:55.344
We'll play in your ballpark, Colonel.

01:31:55.344 --> 01:31:57.846
[Crowd chuckling]

01:31:57.846 --> 01:32:00.349
Now a--a I'd like to get this part clear first.

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:05.354
Th-this is the book...this is the book th-that you're an authority on, isn't it

01:32:05.354 --> 01:32:06.855
That is correct.

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:09.358
You believe that-- that every word written in this book

01:32:09.358 --> 01:32:10.859
should be taken literally

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:12.861
everything in the bible should be accepted

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:15.864
exactly as
it is given there

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:17.866
now, what about this part right here

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:19.368
Where, uh...

01:32:20.369 --> 01:32:22.871
Uh, it talks about, uh,

01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:25.874
Jonah being swallowed by the whale

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:27.376
you figure that really happened

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:29.878
The bible do es not say "a whale."

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:31.880
It says "a big fish"

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.882
Heh heh heh.

01:32:34.383 --> 01:32:36.385
[Chuckling] As a Matter of fact, it says a great fish."""

01:32:36.385 --> 01:32:37.386
[Laughter]

01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:40.389
But I guess one's pretty much the same as the other.

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:43.892
What do you...what do you think about that business

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:45.894
I believe in a god who can make a whale

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:47.396
and who can make a man

01:32:47.396 --> 01:32:49.898
and make both do what he pleases.

01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:54.403
God bless you, Matthew Harrison Brady.

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:55.904
[Crowd] Amen.

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:56.905
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:01.910
I want those Amen's in the record.

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:04.913
Now, I recollect a--a story about Joshua--

01:33:06.415 --> 01:33:08.917
Joshua making the sun stand still.

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:10.919
Uh, as an expert, do you a...tell me

01:33:10.919 --> 01:33:13.922
that that's a... as right as the Jonah business

01:33:15.424 --> 01:33:16.925
That's a pretty neat trick.

01:33:18.427 --> 01:33:20.429
I do not question or scoff

01:33:20.429 --> 01:33:21.930
at the miracles of the lord

01:33:22.431 --> 01:33:23.932
as do ye of little faith

01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:25.434
Have you ever pondered

01:33:25.434 --> 01:33:26.935
what would actually happen to the earth

01:33:27.436 --> 01:33:28.437
if the sun stood still

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:31.440
You can testify to that if I get you on the stand.

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.441
[Laughing]

01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:34.943
If, as they say, "the sun stood still,"

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:36.445
they must have had some kind of an idea

01:33:36.445 --> 01:33:38.947
that the--that the sun moved around the earth.

01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:40.449
Do you think that's the way of things

01:33:40.449 --> 01:33:42.451
or don't you believe the earth moves around the sun

01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:44.453
I have faith in the bible.

01:33:44.453 --> 01:33:46.455
you don't have much faith in the solar system.

01:33:46.455 --> 01:33:47.456
The sun stopped.

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:48.957
Good.

01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:51.960
Now, if what you say actually happened--

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:54.963
if Joshua stopped the sun in the sky--

01:33:56.465 --> 01:33:59.468
the earth stopped spinning on its axis,

01:33:59.468 --> 01:34:01.470
continents toppled over one another,

01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:03.472
mountains flew into space,

01:34:03.472 --> 01:34:06.975
and the earth shriveled to a cinder,

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:08.977
crashed into the sun.

01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:12.981
Now, how come they missed that little tidbit of news

01:34:13.482 --> 01:34:14.483
they missed it because it didn't happen.

01:34:14.983 --> 01:34:15.984
But it had to happen,

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:17.986
It must have happened according to natural law,

01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:19.988
or don't you believe in natural law, Mr. Brady

01:34:20.489 --> 01:34:23.492
would you--would you ban copernicus from the classroom

01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:24.993
along with Charles Darwin

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:26.495
would you pass a law

01:34:26.495 --> 01:34:29.998
throwing out all scientific knowledge since Joshua

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:30.999
revelations, period

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.001
Natural law was born

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:34.503
in the mind of the heavenly father.

01:34:34.503 --> 01:34:36.004
he can change it, cancel it,

01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:37.005
use it as he pleases

01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:38.507
It constantly amazes me

01:34:38.507 --> 01:34:40.008
that you apostles of science,

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:42.010
for all your supposed wisdom,

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:44.513
fail to grasp this simple fact.

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:51.019
Now...ahem.

01:34:51.019 --> 01:34:53.021
Now listen to this.

01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:55.524
This is genesis, 4 to 16.

01:34:57.526 --> 01:35:00.028
"and Cain went out from the presence
of the lord,

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:02.531
and dwelt in" the land of nod,

01:35:02.531 --> 01:35:04.533
"on the east of eden.

01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:07.035
and Cain knew his wife."

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:11.039
Now, where the hell did she come from

01:35:12.541 --> 01:35:13.041
Who

01:35:13.542 --> 01:35:16.044
Mrs. Cain. Cain's wife.

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:18.046
If in the beginning there were just
Cain and Abel

01:35:18.547 --> 01:35:19.548
and Adam and Eve,

01:35:19.548 --> 01:35:22.050
where--where did this extra woman come from

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:23.552
d-did you ever stop to think about that

01:35:23.552 --> 01:35:25.053
No, sir.

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:27.055
I leave the agnostics to hunt for her.

01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:28.056
Ha ha ha!

01:35:28.557 --> 01:35:30.058
[Laughing]

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.061
[Gavel pounding]

01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:34.062
Never bothered you

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:35.063
Never bothered me.

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:36.064
Never tried to find out

01:35:36.565 --> 01:35:37.566
Nope.

01:35:37.566 --> 01:35:39.568
You figure somebody else pulled another creation

01:35:39.568 --> 01:35:41.069
over in the next county somewhere

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:43.572
the bible satisfies me. It is enough.

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:48.577
It frightens me

01:35:48.577 --> 01:35:50.579
to think of the state of learning in the world

01:35:50.579 --> 01:35:53.582
if everybody had your driving curiosity.

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:59.087
Now this book goes into a lot of "begats."

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:05.093
"and Arphaxad begat Salah...

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:07.095
and salah begat Eber..."

01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:09.598
and so on and so on and so on.

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:11.600
How, are these pretty important people

01:36:12.601 --> 01:36:14.102
they are the generations

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:15.103
of the holy men and women

01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:17.105
of the bible.

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:20.108
How'd they go about all this begatting

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:21.610
What do you mean

01:36:21.610 --> 01:36:24.613
Well, I mean, did they a...
did they begat

01:36:24.613 --> 01:36:25.614
in much the same way

01:36:25.614 --> 01:36:29.117
as folks get themselves begat today

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:31.119
The process is about the same

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:32.621
I don't think your scientists

01:36:32.621 --> 01:36:34.122
have improved it any.

01:36:34.122 --> 01:36:35.123
Ha! Ha ha

01:36:35.123 --> 01:36:36.124
[Laughing]

01:36:36.124 --> 01:36:37.626
[Gavel pounding]

01:36:39.127 --> 01:36:40.629
In other words,

01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:44.132
all of these folks were conceived and brought forth

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:48.637
by the normal biological function known as sex.

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:53.141
What do you think of sex, Col.Brady

01:36:54.643 --> 01:36:58.146
in what spirit is this question asked

01:36:58.146 --> 01:37:00.148
[Chuckling] I'm not asking you
what you think of sex

01:37:00.148 --> 01:37:02.150
as a father, as a husband,

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:03.652
or even as a presidential candidate.

01:37:04.152 --> 01:37:06.154
you're up here as an expert on the bible.

01:37:06.655 --> 01:37:09.157
What is the biblical evaluation of sex

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:11.660
It is considered original sin.

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:15.664
and all these holy people got themselves begat

01:37:15.664 --> 01:37:17.165
through original sin

01:37:18.667 --> 01:37:20.168
Well...

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:22.787
all that sinning make them any less holy

01:37:22.787 --> 01:37:24.789
Your honor, where is this leading us

01:37:24.789 --> 01:37:25.790
What has it got to do with

01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:28.293
the State v. Bertram Cates

01:37:28.793 --> 01:37:30.795
Col. Drummond, the court must be satisfied

01:37:30.795 --> 01:37:32.297
that this line of questioning

01:37:32.297 --> 01:37:33.798
has some bearing on the case.

01:37:33.798 --> 01:37:35.800
You've ruled out all of my witnesses.

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:37.302
you must allow me to examine

01:37:37.302 --> 01:37:39.804
the one witness you've left to me in my own way.

01:37:39.804 --> 01:37:41.306
Your honor

01:37:41.306 --> 01:37:42.807
I am willing to sit here

01:37:43.308 --> 01:37:45.310
and endure Mr. Drummond's sneering

01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:46.811
and his disrespect

01:37:47.312 --> 01:37:48.313
for he is pleading

01:37:48.313 --> 01:37:49.314
the case of the prosecution

01:37:49.314 --> 01:37:51.816
by his contempt for all that is holy.

01:37:51.816 --> 01:37:54.319
I object! I object! I object!

01:37:54.319 --> 01:37:56.321
On what grounds

01:37:56.321 --> 01:37:59.824
Is it possible that something is holy

01:37:59.824 --> 01:38:01.826
to the celebrated agnostic

01:38:01.826 --> 01:38:02.827
Yes--

01:38:03.828 --> 01:38:05.830
The individual human mind.

01:38:08.333 --> 01:38:09.834
in a child's power

01:38:09.834 --> 01:38:12.337
to master the multiplication table,

01:38:12.337 --> 01:38:14.339
there is more sanctity

01:38:14.339 --> 01:38:17.842
than in all your shouted "Amens"
and "Holy holies"

01:38:17.842 --> 01:38:19.344
and "Hosannas"!

01:38:19.344 --> 01:38:22.347
An idea is a greater monument

01:38:22.347 --> 01:38:24.349
than a cathedral,

01:38:24.349 --> 01:38:25.850
and the advance of man's knowledge

01:38:26.351 --> 01:38:29.354
is a greater miracle than all the sticks turned to snakes

01:38:29.354 --> 01:38:31.356
or the parting of the waters.

01:38:31.356 --> 01:38:32.857
But now,

01:38:32.857 --> 01:38:34.859
are we to forgo all this progress

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.363
because Mr. Brady now frightens us with a fable

01:38:41.366 --> 01:38:42.867
Gentlemen,

01:38:42.867 --> 01:38:44.869
Progress has never been a bargain.

01:38:44.869 --> 01:38:46.371
you have to pay for it.

01:38:46.371 --> 01:38:48.873
sometimes I think there's a man who sits behind a counter

01:38:48.873 --> 01:38:51.876
and says, "all right, you can have a telephone,

01:38:51.876 --> 01:38:55.380
"but you lose privacy and the charm of distance."

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.383
Madam, you may vote, but at a price.

01:38:58.883 --> 01:39:01.886
"you lose the right to retreat behind the powder puff"

01:39:01.886 --> 01:39:03.388
or your petticoat

01:39:04.889 --> 01:39:07.892
"Mister, you may conquer the air," will lose
their wonder...

01:39:07.892 --> 01:39:10.395
but the birds

01:39:10.895 --> 01:39:13.398
"and the clouds will smell of gasoline."

01:39:14.399 --> 01:39:17.902
Darwin took us forward to a hilltop

01:39:18.403 --> 01:39:19.404
from where we could look back

01:39:19.904 --> 01:39:21.406
and see the way from which we came.

01:39:21.406 --> 01:39:24.409
But for this insight and for this knowledge,

01:39:24.909 --> 01:39:29.414
we must abandon our faith in the pleasant poetry of Genesis.

01:39:29.414 --> 01:39:31.916
We must not abandon faith!

01:39:31.916 --> 01:39:33.918
Faith is the most important thing!

01:39:33.918 --> 01:39:37.422
Then why did God plague us with the power to think

01:39:37.422 --> 01:39:41.926
Mr. Brady, why do you deny the one faculty of man

01:39:41.926 --> 01:39:44.929
that raises him above the other creatures of the earth--

01:39:44.929 --> 01:39:47.432
the power of his brain to reason

01:39:47.432 --> 01:39:49.434
what other merit have we

01:39:49.434 --> 01:39:50.435
the elephant is larger,

01:39:50.435 --> 01:39:52.437
the horse is swifter and stronger,

01:39:52.937 --> 01:39:54.939
the butterfly is far more beautiful,

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.442
the mosquito is more prolific,

01:39:57.442 --> 01:40:01.446
even the simple sponge is more durable.

01:40:01.446 --> 01:40:02.947
Or does a sponge think

01:40:03.448 --> 01:40:04.449
I don't know.

01:40:04.449 --> 01:40:06.451
I'm a man, not a sponge.

01:40:06.451 --> 01:40:07.952
[Laughing]

01:40:07.952 --> 01:40:10.455
Well, do you think a sponge thinks

01:40:10.455 --> 01:40:12.957
If the lord wishes a sponge to think,

01:40:12.957 --> 01:40:14.459
it thinks.

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:16.961
Do you think a man should have

01:40:16.961 --> 01:40:18.963
the same privilege as a sponge

01:40:18.963 --> 01:40:20.465
Of course.

01:40:20.965 --> 01:40:23.968
This man wishes to be accorded

01:40:23.968 --> 01:40:26.471
the same privilege as a sponge.

01:40:26.471 --> 01:40:27.972
He wishes to think!

01:40:36.981 --> 01:40:38.483
But your client is wrong!

01:40:38.483 --> 01:40:41.986
He is deluded! he has lost his way!

01:40:41.986 --> 01:40:43.488
It's sad that we don't all have

01:40:43.488 --> 01:40:45.490
your positive knowledge of what is right and wrong,

01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:46.991
Mr. Brady.

01:40:52.497 --> 01:40:55.500
How old do you think this rock is

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.002
I am more interested in the rock of ages

01:40:58.002 --> 01:40:59.504
than I am in the age of rocks.

01:40:59.504 --> 01:41:01.005
Ha!
Ha ha

01:41:01.005 --> 01:41:02.507
Dr. Page of Oberlin College

01:41:02.507 --> 01:41:05.510
tells me this rock is at least 10 million years old.

01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:07.011
Well, well ...

01:41:07.011 --> 01:41:08.513
Col. Drummond,

01:41:08.513 --> 01:41:09.514
you managed to sneak in

01:41:09.514 --> 01:41:12.517
some of that scientific testimony after all.

01:41:13.518 --> 01:41:14.519
Look, Mr. Brady...

01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:17.522
these are the fossil remains

01:41:17.522 --> 01:41:20.024
of a marine prehistoric creature

01:41:20.024 --> 01:41:21.526
found in this very county

01:41:21.526 --> 01:41:23.528
and which lived here millions of years ago

01:41:24.028 --> 01:41:25.530
when these very mountain ranges

01:41:25.530 --> 01:41:26.531
were submerged in water.

01:41:26.531 --> 01:41:27.532
I know.

01:41:28.032 --> 01:41:29.534
The bible gives a fine account of the flood.

01:41:29.534 --> 01:41:32.036
But your professor's a little mixed-up on his dates.

01:41:32.036 --> 01:41:35.039
That rock is not more than 6,000 years old.

01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:37.041
How do you know

01:41:37.041 --> 01:41:39.544
A fine biblical scholar, Bishop Usher,

01:41:39.544 --> 01:41:41.045
has determined for us

01:41:41.045 --> 01:41:43.548
the exact date and hour of the creation

01:41:43.548 --> 01:41:46.551
it occurred in the year 4004 B.C.

01:41:48.553 --> 01:41:50.555
Ah, well,
uh, that...

01:41:50.555 --> 01:41:52.557
That's...that's, uh, Bishop Usher's opinion.

01:41:52.557 --> 01:41:53.558
It's not an opinion.

01:41:54.058 --> 01:41:55.059
It's a literal fact,

01:41:55.059 --> 01:41:56.561
which the good Bishop arrived at

01:41:56.561 --> 01:41:58.062
through careful computation

01:41:58.062 --> 01:41:59.564
of the ages of the prophets

01:41:59.564 --> 01:42:01.566
as set down in the old testament.

01:42:01.566 --> 01:42:02.567
In fact,

01:42:03.067 --> 01:42:04.569
he determined that the Lord began the creation

01:42:04.569 --> 01:42:08.573
on the 23rd of october, 4004 B.C.

01:42:08.573 --> 01:42:10.575
at, uh, 9 a.m.

01:42:14.579 --> 01:42:16.581
At eastern standard time

01:42:17.582 --> 01:42:20.585
or rocky mountain time

01:42:20.585 --> 01:42:22.587
it wasn't daylight saving time, was it

01:42:23.087 --> 01:42:24.589
because the lord didn't make the sun

01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:25.590
until the 4th day.

01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:26.591
That is correct.

01:42:26.591 --> 01:42:27.592
That first day, uh...

01:42:28.092 --> 01:42:29.093
Wha-what do you think it was,

01:42:29.093 --> 01:42:30.094
24 hours long

01:42:30.094 --> 01:42:31.596
Bible says it was a day.

01:42:31.596 --> 01:42:33.097
Well, there was no sun

01:42:33.097 --> 01:42:35.600
h-how do you know how long it was

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.101
The bible says it was a day.

01:42:37.101 --> 01:42:40.104
Well, was it a normal day, a literal day, a 24-hour day

01:42:40.104 --> 01:42:41.105
I don't know.

01:42:41.606 --> 01:42:43.107
[Col. Drummond] what do you think

01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:46.611
I do not think about things

01:42:46.611 --> 01:42:48.613
that I do not think about.

01:42:49.113 --> 01:42:50.615
Do you ever think about things

01:42:50.615 --> 01:42:52.116
that you do think about

01:42:52.116 --> 01:42:53.618
Isn't it possible

01:42:53.618 --> 01:42:55.620
that it could have been 25 hours

01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:58.122
there was no way to measure it.
No way to tell.

01:42:58.623 --> 01:43:00.625
Could it have been 25 hours

01:43:00.625 --> 01:43:01.626
It is possible.

01:43:02.126 --> 01:43:04.629
then you interpret that the first day

01:43:05.129 --> 01:43:07.131
as recorded in the book of Genesis

01:43:07.131 --> 01:43:09.634
could have been a day of indeterminate length

01:43:09.634 --> 01:43:10.635
I mean to state

01:43:11.135 --> 01:43:14.639
that it is not necessarily a 24-hour day.

01:43:14.639 --> 01:43:16.641
It could have been 30 hours,

01:43:16.641 --> 01:43:17.642
It could have been a week.

01:43:18.142 --> 01:43:20.144
It could have been a month, it could have been a year,

01:43:20.645 --> 01:43:21.646
it could have been a hundred years,

01:43:22.146 --> 01:43:23.648
or it could have been 10 million years!

01:43:23.648 --> 01:43:24.649
I protest!

01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:26.651
This is not only irrelevant, immaterial,

01:43:26.651 --> 01:43:28.152
it is illegal!

01:43:28.152 --> 01:43:29.153
I demand to know the purpose

01:43:29.654 --> 01:43:30.655
of Mr. Drummond's examination.

01:43:30.655 --> 01:43:32.156
What's he trying to do

01:43:32.156 --> 01:43:33.658
I'll tell you what he's trying to do.

01:43:33.658 --> 01:43:35.660
He wants to destroy everybody's belief in the bible

01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:36.661
and in God.

01:43:38.162 --> 01:43:40.164
That's not true, and you know it.

01:43:41.666 --> 01:43:43.167
The bible is a book.

01:43:43.668 --> 01:43:47.171
It's a good book, but it is not the only book.

01:43:47.171 --> 01:43:50.174
It is the revealed word of the almighty God

01:43:50.675 --> 01:43:52.677
spake to the men who wrote the bible.

01:43:52.677 --> 01:43:55.680
How do you know that god didn't spake to Charles Darwin

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.682
I know, because God tells me to oppose

01:43:57.682 --> 01:43:59.183
the evil teachings of that man.

01:43:59.183 --> 01:44:01.185
Oh, God speaks to you
Yes!

01:44:01.185 --> 01:44:02.687
He tells you what is right and wrong,
Yes

01:44:02.687 --> 01:44:04.188
and you act accordingly
Yes.

01:44:04.188 --> 01:44:05.690
So you, Matthew Harrison Brady,

01:44:06.190 --> 01:44:08.693
through oratory or legislature or whatever,

01:44:09.193 --> 01:44:10.695
you pass on god's orders

01:44:11.195 --> 01:44:12.697
to the rest of the world!

01:44:12.697 --> 01:44:17.201
Well, meet the prophet from Nebraska!

01:44:17.201 --> 01:44:18.703
Is that the way of things

01:44:18.703 --> 01:44:20.705
is that the way of things

01:44:20.705 --> 01:44:23.708
God tells Brady what is good.

01:44:23.708 --> 01:44:25.710
to be against Brady is to be against God.

01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:28.212
No! each man is a free agent!

01:44:28.713 --> 01:44:32.216
Then what is Bertram Cates doing in a Hillsboro jail

01:44:32.216 --> 01:44:35.219
supposing Mr. Cates had the influence and the lung power

01:44:35.219 --> 01:44:37.722
to railroad through the state legislature

01:44:37.722 --> 01:44:39.724
a law saying that only Darwin

01:44:39.724 --> 01:44:41.225
could be taught in the schools

01:44:41.225 --> 01:44:42.226
Ridiculous! Ridiculous!

01:44:42.727 --> 01:44:45.229
There is only one great truth in the world.

01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:46.230
The gospel--

01:44:46.230 --> 01:44:49.233
the gospel according to Brady.

01:44:49.233 --> 01:44:53.237
God speaks to Brady, and Brady tells the world!

01:44:53.237 --> 01:44:56.240
Brady, Brady, Brady almighty!

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.742
The lord--the lord is my strength!

01:44:57.742 --> 01:44:59.744
suppose that a lesser human being--

01:44:59.744 --> 01:45:01.746
suppose a Cates or a Darwin

01:45:02.246 --> 01:45:06.250
had the audacity to think that God might whisper to him,

01:45:06.250 --> 01:45:09.253
that an un-Brady thought might still be holy

01:45:09.253 --> 01:45:11.756
must a man go to prison because he differs

01:45:11.756 --> 01:45:13.758
with the self-appointed prophet

01:45:13.758 --> 01:45:15.760
extend the testaments.

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.762
Let us have a book of Brady.

01:45:18.262 --> 01:45:19.764
We shall hex the Pentateuch

01:45:19.764 --> 01:45:21.265
and slip you in neatly

01:45:21.265 --> 01:45:22.767
between Numbers and Deuteronomy!

01:45:22.767 --> 01:45:23.768
N-now, my friends...

01:45:24.268 --> 01:45:26.270
Your honor, my followers..

01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:27.271
ladies and gentlemen...

01:45:27.271 --> 01:45:28.272
The witness is excused!

01:45:28.272 --> 01:45:29.774
All of you know what I stand for.

01:45:29.774 --> 01:45:31.776
What I believe...

01:45:31.776 --> 01:45:33.277
I believe in the truth of the book of Genesis--

01:45:33.277 --> 01:45:35.279
Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,

01:45:35.279 --> 01:45:37.281
Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1st Samuel,

01:45:37.281 --> 01:45:39.784
2nd Samuel, 1st Kings, 2nd Kings,

01:45:39.784 --> 01:45:43.287
Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Lamentations,
Ezekiel...

01:45:43.287 --> 01:45:46.290
[Judge] Court is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:47.291
[Judge pounding gavel]

01:45:47.792 --> 01:45:51.295
[Chattering]

01:45:59.187 --> 01:46:00.188
Matt

01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:02.690
Matt, dear

01:46:03.191 --> 01:46:04.692
let's go home.

01:46:05.693 --> 01:46:06.694
Home

01:46:06.694 --> 01:46:08.196
Back to the hotel.

01:46:08.196 --> 01:46:09.197
Uh.

01:46:20.992 --> 01:46:24.996
[Knocking at door]

01:46:31.002 --> 01:46:32.503
Who is it

01:46:36.007 --> 01:46:37.008
Where is he

01:46:37.008 --> 01:46:38.009
I've got to talk to him.

01:46:38.009 --> 01:46:40.511
Not now, Rachel. He isn't feeling well.

01:46:40.511 --> 01:46:42.013
Yes, now.

01:46:42.013 --> 01:46:43.514
He's got to tell Bert it wasn't my fault

01:46:43.514 --> 01:46:45.016
Rachel, please be quiet. He's sleeping.

01:46:45.016 --> 01:46:47.018
Why should I be quiet

01:46:47.018 --> 01:46:48.519
I want the whole world to know

01:46:48.519 --> 01:46:50.021
that Matthew Harrison Brady's a fake.

01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:51.522
Rachel!

01:47:02.033 --> 01:47:03.034
I'm sorry.

01:47:15.296 --> 01:47:17.298
I found myself in bed today,

01:47:18.299 --> 01:47:21.302
in the middle of the day.

01:47:21.302 --> 01:47:24.806
I-I was dreaming I was in the witness chair--

01:47:24.806 --> 01:47:26.808
chained to it.

01:47:26.808 --> 01:47:29.310
I kept begging him to let me go.

01:47:29.310 --> 01:47:31.813
Oh, Rachel, Rachel, it's been a nightmare for all of us.

01:47:31.813 --> 01:47:33.815
But mine was real.

01:47:33.815 --> 01:47:35.817
I turned to your husband for help.

01:47:36.317 --> 01:47:38.820
he encouraged me to open up my heart to him,

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:41.322
and then he twisted my words.

01:47:41.322 --> 01:47:42.824
He tricked me.

01:47:42.824 --> 01:47:44.826
Why why did he do it

01:47:44.826 --> 01:47:46.327
I don't know.

01:47:46.327 --> 01:47:48.329
I don't know why he did it.

01:47:51.833 --> 01:47:53.835
Maybe it meant too much to him.

01:47:53.835 --> 01:47:56.337
Maybe he was tired or afraid.

01:47:56.838 --> 01:47:58.339
I taught my pupils

01:47:58.339 --> 01:48:00.842
that Matthew Harrison Brady was a great man--

01:48:00.842 --> 01:48:02.343
next to God, almost.

01:48:02.343 --> 01:48:04.345
What do you want me to teach them now

01:48:04.345 --> 01:48:06.347
He's still the same man.

01:48:06.347 --> 01:48:08.349
No, if he could do such an evil thing,

01:48:08.349 --> 01:48:10.351
then he must be an evil man,

01:48:10.351 --> 01:48:11.853
and everything he stands for

01:48:11.853 --> 01:48:12.854
must be evil, too.

01:48:12.854 --> 01:48:14.355
Oh, stop it! stop it!

01:48:16.607 --> 01:48:19.110
Youth can be so pure.

01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:21.112
What do you know of good or evil

01:48:21.112 --> 01:48:22.613
what do you understand

01:48:22.613 --> 01:48:24.615
of the sum of a man's life

01:48:24.615 --> 01:48:25.616
He betrayed me.

01:48:25.616 --> 01:48:27.618
You betrayed yourself.

01:48:27.618 --> 01:48:30.121
You see my husband as a saint,

01:48:30.121 --> 01:48:33.624
and so he must be right in everything he says and does.

01:48:34.125 --> 01:48:35.626
and then you see him as a devil,

01:48:35.626 --> 01:48:38.629
and everything he says and does must be wrong.

01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:42.767
Well, my husband's neither a saint nor a devil.

01:48:42.767 --> 01:48:44.769
He's just a human being...

01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:47.772
and he makes mistakes.

01:48:48.272 --> 01:48:49.774
How can you defend him

01:48:49.774 --> 01:48:51.776
it's not he I'm defending.

01:48:51.776 --> 01:48:55.279
I'm defending the 40 years I've lived with this man

01:48:55.279 --> 01:48:57.281
and watched him carry the burdens

01:48:57.281 --> 01:48:58.783
of people like you.

01:48:58.783 --> 01:49:00.284
If he's been wrong,

01:49:00.284 --> 01:49:02.286
at least he stood for something.

01:49:02.286 --> 01:49:04.288
What do you stand for

01:49:04.288 --> 01:49:07.792
do you believe in Bertram Cates

01:49:07.792 --> 01:49:10.294
I believe in my husband.

01:49:10.294 --> 01:49:11.796
What do you believe in

01:49:14.298 --> 01:49:15.299
Matt.

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.301
I was asleep, but...

01:49:19.804 --> 01:49:21.806
What can I do for you, child

01:49:23.808 --> 01:49:26.310
I'm not your child any longer,
Mr. Brady--

01:49:27.311 --> 01:49:28.312
yours...

01:49:30.314 --> 01:49:31.816
or anyone else's.

01:49:38.823 --> 01:49:40.324
[Door closing]

01:49:40.324 --> 01:49:41.826
What...

01:49:43.327 --> 01:49:44.829
What did she want, Sarah

01:49:48.833 --> 01:49:50.835
Whe's been hurt, Matt.

01:49:53.337 --> 01:49:54.839
You hurt her.

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:56.841
Oh, Matt,

01:49:57.842 --> 01:50:00.845
you were always a good man.

01:50:00.845 --> 01:50:01.846
that's why I loved you,

01:50:02.346 --> 01:50:03.848
even from the very beginning.

01:50:03.848 --> 01:50:07.852
people said you made mistakes, wrong decisions.

01:50:08.352 --> 01:50:10.354
you could have been president 3 times over,

01:50:10.855 --> 01:50:13.357
but I never doubted you, Matt,

01:50:13.357 --> 01:50:16.360
because your decisions were honest.

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.863
You never sacrificed your principles just to win.

01:50:19.363 --> 01:50:20.865
I didn't mean to hurt her.

01:50:20.865 --> 01:50:22.366
Sarah...

01:50:22.366 --> 01:50:23.868
Sarah, a victory here

01:50:23.868 --> 01:50:24.869
would be a monument to God

01:50:25.369 --> 01:50:26.370
that would last a 1,000 years!

01:50:26.871 --> 01:50:27.872
but Matt,

01:50:27.872 --> 01:50:30.374
every man has to build his own monument.

01:50:30.374 --> 01:50:31.876
You can't do it for them, Matt.

01:50:32.376 --> 01:50:35.379
If you do, it becomes your monument, not theirs,

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:40.384
and they'll topple it the minute they find a flaw in it.

01:50:40.384 --> 01:50:44.388
you mean a flaw in me, don't you, Sarah

01:50:48.893 --> 01:50:51.395
they turned away from you this afternoon, Matt.

01:50:51.395 --> 01:50:53.397
Ah, they didn't understand.

01:50:54.398 --> 01:50:56.901
I'll make them understand.

01:50:56.901 --> 01:50:58.903
They'll have to understand.

01:50:58.903 --> 01:51:00.404
My speech. Where's my speech

01:51:00.404 --> 01:51:02.406
Matt...

01:51:02.406 --> 01:51:03.908
I'll make them listen.

01:51:03.908 --> 01:51:04.909
Matt!

01:51:04.909 --> 01:51:06.410
Where's my speech I must have it!

01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:07.411
I'll make them understand!

01:51:07.411 --> 01:51:08.913
Matt, please don't get excited.

01:51:08.913 --> 01:51:10.414
Here--here it is. I have it all down on paper here.

01:51:10.915 --> 01:51:11.415
Sarah.

01:51:11.415 --> 01:51:12.917
It isn't just this case.

01:51:12.917 --> 01:51:15.419
It's god himself that's on trial.

01:51:15.419 --> 01:51:17.922
They'll--they'll have to listen to me.

01:51:17.922 --> 01:51:19.924
They will listen to me.

01:51:24.428 --> 01:51:25.930
They'll listen, dear.

01:51:29.433 --> 01:51:31.435
Mother, they laughed at me.

01:51:31.435 --> 01:51:32.937
Hush, baby.

01:51:32.937 --> 01:51:35.439
I can't stand it when they laugh at me.

01:51:35.439 --> 01:51:36.941
It's all right, baby.

01:51:37.942 --> 01:51:38.943
It's all right.

01:51:39.443 --> 01:51:40.444
They laughed.

01:51:40.945 --> 01:51:41.946
Baby...

01:51:42.947 --> 01:51:43.948
Baby...

01:51:52.456 --> 01:51:53.958
Ahem.

01:51:53.958 --> 01:51:55.960
Testing, testing,
1, 2, 3, 4.

01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:58.462
1, 2, 3, 4,
testing.

01:51:58.462 --> 01:52:00.464
Testing, 1, 2, 3, 4.

01:52:01.465 --> 01:52:03.467
1, 2, 3, 4

01:52:05.469 --> 01:52:08.973
[Chattering]

01:52:50.516 --> 01:52:53.519
You brought me some more clean shirts

01:52:53.519 --> 01:52:56.021
Bert, I left my father.

01:52:58.023 --> 01:53:01.026
I messed things up pretty badly
for us, didn't I

01:53:02.528 --> 01:53:04.029
It wasn't your fault, Rach.

01:53:04.029 --> 01:53:05.531
I know how Brady can twist things--

01:53:05.531 --> 01:53:07.533
It wasn't his fault.

01:53:07.533 --> 01:53:09.034
I should have done this from the beginning.

01:53:10.035 --> 01:53:11.036
I-I want--

01:53:11.036 --> 01:53:12.037
Rach...

01:53:13.539 --> 01:53:15.040
You don't have to say it.

01:53:16.542 --> 01:53:18.544
I'm just glad you're here.

01:53:21.046 --> 01:53:23.048
Come on, you sit down.

01:53:36.061 --> 01:53:40.065
Well, welcome back to our side, Miss Brown.

01:53:46.572 --> 01:53:48.073
What's that

01:53:48.073 --> 01:53:49.575
Enunciator

01:53:50.075 --> 01:53:51.577
doing a broadcast

01:53:51.577 --> 01:53:53.579
got a direct wire to WGN, chicago.

01:53:53.579 --> 01:53:55.080
as soon as the jury returns,

01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.582
we'll broadcast the verdict.

01:53:56.582 --> 01:53:59.084
Mmm, radio.

01:53:59.084 --> 01:54:01.086
God, that's going to break down a lot of walls.

01:54:01.086 --> 01:54:03.088
You're not supposed to say "God" on the radio.

01:54:03.088 --> 01:54:04.089
Why the hell not

01:54:04.590 --> 01:54:05.591
You're not supposed to say "hell," either

01:54:06.091 --> 01:54:08.594
This is going to be a barren source of amusement.

01:54:12.097 --> 01:54:14.600
Well, Colonel...

01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:17.102
There's a little toy you'll never have any use for,

01:54:17.102 --> 01:54:19.104
not with your lungs.

01:54:19.104 --> 01:54:20.606
Uh, the radio.

01:54:20.606 --> 01:54:23.609
You whisper into it, and it shouts at a million people

01:54:23.609 --> 01:54:25.110
through loudspeakers.

01:54:50.135 --> 01:54:51.637
What do you think

01:54:51.637 --> 01:54:53.639
Can you tell from their faces

01:54:59.645 --> 01:55:01.013
Everybody rise.

01:55:02.014 --> 01:55:04.516
Hear ye, hear ye. court will reconvene

01:55:04.516 --> 01:55:07.519
in the case of the State v. Bertram Cates.

01:55:11.523 --> 01:55:13.025
All right. Go ahead

01:55:14.526 --> 01:55:16.528
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Harry Esterbrook

01:55:16.528 --> 01:55:18.530
speaking to you from the courthouse here in Hillsboro,

01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:21.033
where the jury has returned to render its verdict

01:55:21.033 --> 01:55:23.285
in the historic Hillsboro monkey trial case.

01:55:23.285 --> 01:55:24.787
The judge has taken the bench,

01:55:24.787 --> 01:55:27.172
in a few moments, we will know whether Bertram Cates

01:55:27.172 --> 01:55:28.674
will be found innocent or guilty.

01:55:28.674 --> 01:55:30.175
I wish I could describe the tension,

01:55:30.175 --> 01:55:31.176
in this courtroom today,

01:55:31.176 --> 01:55:32.678
The verbal and legal elements--

01:55:32.678 --> 01:55:33.679
one moment, please.

01:55:33.679 --> 01:55:34.680
Please stand by.

01:55:35.681 --> 01:55:37.182
I've been on the phone

01:55:37.182 --> 01:55:38.684
with the lieutenant governor all morning.

01:55:38.684 --> 01:55:40.686
The newspapers haven't been very kind to us.

01:55:41.186 --> 01:55:43.188
The boys in the capital seem to think it wouldn't do any harm

01:55:43.689 --> 01:55:46.692
if you was to let this whole thing kind of...simmer down.

01:55:47.192 --> 01:55:50.195
Well now, wait a minute, Jason, I have an obligation to the law.

01:55:50.195 --> 01:55:52.197
Of course you have, Merle,

01:55:52.698 --> 01:55:55.701
but...but don't forget, November's not too far off.

01:56:02.324 --> 01:56:04.827
[Clears throat]

01:56:04.827 --> 01:56:08.330
Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict

01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:11.333
Yes, sir-- er, your honor-- w-we have.

01:56:24.847 --> 01:56:27.349
The, uh, verdi ct of the jury is unanimous--

01:56:27.349 --> 01:56:29.852
Bertram Cates is found guilty as charged.

01:56:30.352 --> 01:56:32.855
And so, ladies and gentleman, you have heard the verdict

01:56:32.855 --> 01:56:34.857
as read by presiding Judge Coffey.

01:56:34.857 --> 01:56:37.860
Bertram Cates, schoolteacher, keystone, and defendant

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:40.362
in one of the greatest ethical contests known to our country,

01:56:40.362 --> 01:56:42.364
Bertram Cates has been found guilty.

01:56:42.364 --> 01:56:43.866
The law has been satisfied.

01:56:44.366 --> 01:56:45.868
But what profound repercussions

01:56:45.868 --> 01:56:48.871
of what has happened in this courtroom will be known only to the future.

01:56:48.871 --> 01:56:50.372
Quiet, please.
Order.

01:56:50.372 --> 01:56:51.373
Stand by, please.

01:56:51.373 --> 01:56:53.375
This court is still in session

01:56:54.877 --> 01:56:56.879
You'll remove that now, please.

01:57:02.885 --> 01:57:05.387
The prisoner will rise

01:57:05.387 --> 01:57:07.890
to hear the sentence of this court.

01:57:12.394 --> 01:57:14.897
Bert, do you wish to make any statement

01:57:14.897 --> 01:57:16.899
before sentence is passed

01:57:29.161 --> 01:57:31.663
Your honor, I'm not a public speaker.

01:57:33.665 --> 01:57:36.168
I do not have the eloquence as some of the...

01:57:36.668 --> 01:57:39.671
men you've heard in the last few days.

01:57:39.671 --> 01:57:41.173
I'm just a schoolteacher.

01:57:41.173 --> 01:57:43.175
Not anymore,
You ain't!

01:57:43.175 --> 01:57:45.677
[Crowd murmuring agreement]

01:57:45.677 --> 01:57:47.062
[Gavel pounding]

01:57:49.064 --> 01:57:51.066
I was a schoolteacher.

01:57:54.570 --> 01:57:56.071
I feel that...

01:57:58.073 --> 01:58:01.076
I've been convicted of violating an unjust law.

01:58:03.579 --> 01:58:08.083
I will continue in the future, as I have in the past,

01:58:08.083 --> 01:58:10.586
to oppose this law in any way I can.

01:58:18.210 --> 01:58:21.713
[Judge] Bertram Cates, this court has found you guilty

01:58:21.713 --> 01:58:24.216
of violating public act volume 37,

01:58:24.216 --> 01:58:27.603
statute 31428 as charged.

01:58:27.603 --> 01:58:30.606
this violation is punishable by fine

01:58:31.106 --> 01:58:33.609
and, or imprisonment.

01:58:33.609 --> 01:58:38.614
But since there has been no previous violation of this statute,

01:58:38.614 --> 01:58:41.116
there's no precedent to guide the bench

01:58:41.617 --> 01:58:43.118
passing sentence.

01:58:44.119 --> 01:58:45.621
court deems it proper

01:58:50.626 --> 01:58:53.629
to sentence Bertram Cates to pay a fine of...

01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:54.630
Ahem.

01:58:56.515 --> 01:59:00.519
[Excited chattering]

01:59:00.519 --> 01:59:04.022
Ah...ah, did ah...

01:59:04.022 --> 01:59:06.775
Did your honor say $100

01:59:06.775 --> 01:59:08.277
That is correct.

01:59:08.277 --> 01:59:10.279
That seems to conclude the business of the trial.

01:59:10.279 --> 01:59:12.531
But, your honor, the prosecution takes exception.

01:59:13.031 --> 01:59:14.533
Why, the issues are so titanic

01:59:15.033 --> 01:59:17.035
the court must mete out more drastic punishment--

01:59:17.035 --> 01:59:18.036
I object.

01:59:18.537 --> 01:59:20.038
to make an example of this transgressor,

01:59:20.038 --> 01:59:21.540
to show the world--

01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:23.041
Just a minute,
just a minute.

01:59:23.041 --> 01:59:25.043
The amount of the fine is of no concern to me,

01:59:25.043 --> 01:59:27.546
because Bertram Cates has no intention of paying

01:59:27.546 --> 01:59:29.047
this or any other fine.

01:59:29.047 --> 01:59:32.050
If it were one single dollar, he would not pay it.

01:59:32.050 --> 01:59:35.554
We are going to appeal this decision to the state supreme court.

01:59:36.054 --> 01:59:39.558
Will the court grant us 30 days in which to prepare the appeal

01:59:40.175 --> 01:59:40.676
Granted.

01:59:41.176 --> 01:59:43.178
Court fixes bond at $200.

01:59:43.178 --> 01:59:46.064
I believe that concludes the business of this trial

01:59:46.064 --> 01:59:48.066
Therefore, I declare this court adjourned.

01:59:48.066 --> 01:59:50.569
Your honor, with the court's permission,

01:59:50.569 --> 01:59:52.070
I should like to read into the record

01:59:52.571 --> 01:59:54.072
a few short remarks which I have prepared.

01:59:54.072 --> 01:59:56.575
I object to that.

01:59:56.575 --> 01:59:58.577
Mr. Brady is free to read any remarks,

01:59:59.077 --> 02:00:00.078
long, short, or otherwise,

02:00:00.579 --> 02:00:02.581
in a Chautauqua tent or a political campaign,

02:00:02.581 --> 02:00:05.083
but our business in Hillsboro is completed.

02:00:05.083 --> 02:00:07.085
The defense moves that the court be adjourned.

02:00:07.085 --> 02:00:09.087
But I-I have a few remarks--

02:00:09.087 --> 02:00:11.456
[Judge] and we are all anxious to hear them, sir

02:00:11.456 --> 02:00:14.459
But Col.Drummond's point of procedure is well taken.

02:00:14.459 --> 02:00:18.463
I'm sure everyone here will wish to remain after the court is adjourned

02:00:18.463 --> 02:00:20.465
To hear your address.

02:00:20.465 --> 02:00:23.218
I hereby declare this court is adjourned,

02:00:23.218 --> 02:00:24.219
Sine die.

02:00:24.219 --> 02:00:25.721
[Judge pounding gavel]

02:00:25.721 --> 02:00:28.223
[Shouts] My friends, my dear friends

02:00:28.223 --> 02:00:29.725
Your attention, please.

02:00:29.725 --> 02:00:31.226
[Clamoring]

02:00:31.727 --> 02:00:35.981
Fellow citizens and friends of the unseen audience,

02:00:35.981 --> 02:00:38.483
from the hallowed hills of sacred sinai

02:00:38.483 --> 02:00:41.486
in the days of remote antiquity came the law...

02:00:41.486 --> 02:00:43.488
[Clamoring]

02:00:43.989 --> 02:00:44.990
[Child bangs gavel]

02:00:48.994 --> 02:00:51.246
and here, here in this courtroom...

02:00:51.630 --> 02:00:52.631
here in this courtroom...

02:00:52.631 --> 02:00:54.633
Oh, no, no.

02:00:54.633 --> 02:00:56.134
As they would look to the mountains..

02:00:57.636 --> 02:00:59.137
from time remembered,

02:00:59.137 --> 02:01:02.758
wherever man's body has known the last of hunger..

02:01:02.758 --> 02:01:05.394
[Brady] lost in darkness and despair, and here--

02:01:05.394 --> 02:01:06.895
here in this courtroom,

02:01:07.396 --> 02:01:10.515
living still, in spite of dunge on, fire and sword

02:01:10.515 --> 02:01:12.517
[Man] Eskimo pies, 5 cents.

02:01:12.517 --> 02:01:14.019
Eskimo pies!

02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:17.522
Eskimo pies, sweet as honey.

02:01:17.522 --> 02:01:20.525
Here's where you bring your money.
Eskimo pies.

02:01:20.525 --> 02:01:22.027
...is a law.

02:01:22.527 --> 02:01:24.029
[Brady continues]

02:01:27.532 --> 02:01:29.785
[Brady] from the hallowed hills of sacred sinai

02:01:29.785 --> 02:01:31.787
in the days of remote antiquity came the law,

02:01:32.287 --> 02:01:33.789
which has been our bulwark and our shield

02:01:34.289 --> 02:01:36.291
and here, here in this courtroom,

02:01:36.291 --> 02:01:37.793
we have seen vindicated

02:01:37.793 --> 02:01:39.795
the faith of our fathers.

02:01:39.795 --> 02:01:43.298
living still in spite of dungeon, fire and sword.

02:01:43.298 --> 02:01:44.800
Oh, how our hearts be high with joy,

02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.301
whenever we hear the glorious word

02:01:46.301 --> 02:01:47.803
Faith of our fathers, holy faith,

02:01:47.803 --> 02:01:49.805
we will be true to thee...

02:01:49.805 --> 02:01:50.806
[Loses voice]

02:01:51.807 --> 02:01:52.808
till death...

02:01:52.808 --> 02:01:54.309
[Loses voice]

02:01:54.309 --> 02:01:56.311
[Breathing heavily]

02:01:57.195 --> 02:01:58.697
Matt!

02:01:58.697 --> 02:01:59.815
Matt!

02:02:01.316 --> 02:02:03.318
[Mmrs. Brady] Oh, dear god. Matt!

02:02:03.318 --> 02:02:04.319
[Man] Get back. Let him have some air.

02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:06.321
[Woman] Lord, pass us a miracle

02:02:06.321 --> 02:02:09.324
and save our holy prophet!

02:02:09.324 --> 02:02:10.826
[Man] Get a doctor.

02:02:19.551 --> 02:02:21.052
[Drummond] I cannot imagine the world

02:02:21.052 --> 02:02:23.555
without Matthew Harrison Brady.

02:02:23.555 --> 02:02:25.924
Ah, get me the Baltimore Herald, please.

02:02:25.924 --> 02:02:27.926
What did he die of did they say

02:02:27.926 --> 02:02:30.929
He died of a busted belly.

02:02:30.929 --> 02:02:32.931
There was much greatness in the man.

02:02:34.432 --> 02:02:36.935
can I quote you in the obituary

02:02:36.935 --> 02:02:38.436
Write anything you damn--

02:02:38.436 --> 02:02:39.938
write anything you please.

02:02:39.938 --> 02:02:41.439
How do you write an obituary for a man

02:02:41.439 --> 02:02:43.441
who's been dead 30 years

02:02:43.441 --> 02:02:44.943
Operator

02:02:46.945 --> 02:02:49.447
Say, what did he say to the minister

02:02:51.449 --> 02:02:52.951
You know, that fits.

02:02:52.951 --> 02:02:55.453
He delivered his own obituary.

02:02:55.453 --> 02:02:57.455
Ah, ah, where'd you put that, uh--

02:02:58.957 --> 02:02:59.958
Ah, here it is.

02:03:00.959 --> 02:03:02.961
His book.

02:03:02.961 --> 02:03:04.963
That, ah, was proverbs, wasn't it

02:03:07.465 --> 02:03:09.467
"He that troubleth his own house"

02:03:09.467 --> 02:03:11.970
shall inherit the wind.

02:03:11.970 --> 02:03:14.973
"and the fool shall be servant to the wise in heart."

02:03:18.476 --> 02:03:19.477
Well...

02:03:21.479 --> 02:03:23.982
Well, Col.Drummond, we're growing an odd crop

02:03:23.982 --> 02:03:25.483
of agnostics this year.

02:03:25.984 --> 02:03:26.985
[Drops bible]

02:03:26.985 --> 02:03:28.486
You know, Hornbeck

02:03:28.486 --> 02:03:29.988
I'm getting damned sick of you.

02:03:29.988 --> 02:03:31.489
Why

02:03:31.489 --> 02:03:33.491
You never pushed a noun against a verb

02:03:33.491 --> 02:03:35.994
except to blow up something.

02:03:35.994 --> 02:03:38.496
You know, that's a typical lawyer's trick...

02:03:38.496 --> 02:03:40.498
accusing the accuser.

02:03:40.498 --> 02:03:42.000
Of what am I accused

02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:44.502
Contempt of conscience.

02:03:44.502 --> 02:03:48.006
sentimentality in the first degree.

02:03:48.006 --> 02:03:51.509
Why, because I refuse to erase a man's lifetime

02:03:51.509 --> 02:03:54.012
No, because you know what I thought of him,

02:03:54.012 --> 02:03:55.513
and I know what you thought,

02:03:56.014 --> 02:03:58.016
so let's leave the lamentations to the illiterate.

02:03:59.517 --> 02:04:02.020
What is this, be-kind-to-bigots week

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.522
Why should we weep for him

02:04:04.522 --> 02:04:06.524
Because he's dead.
Oh, no.

02:04:06.524 --> 02:04:08.026
Besides, he cried enough for himself

02:04:08.026 --> 02:04:09.527
during his lifetime.

02:04:09.527 --> 02:04:11.529
The national tearduct

02:04:11.529 --> 02:04:14.032
from Weeping Water, Nebraska.

02:04:14.032 --> 02:04:15.533
[Laughing] he flooded the nation

02:04:15.533 --> 02:04:17.035
like a one-man Mississippi.

02:04:18.036 --> 02:04:19.537
You know what he was,

02:04:20.038 --> 02:04:23.041
that bible-beating bunco artist.

02:04:23.041 --> 02:04:25.543
a giant once lived in that body,

02:04:26.044 --> 02:04:27.545
but Matt Brady got lost

02:04:27.545 --> 02:04:29.547
because he looked for a god too high up

02:04:29.547 --> 02:04:31.049
and too far away.

02:04:37.055 --> 02:04:39.057
Wh-why, you hypocrite.

02:04:39.057 --> 02:04:41.059
Y-you fraud.

02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:45.063
The atheist who believes in God.

02:04:45.563 --> 02:04:48.566
Aah, you're just as religious as he was.

02:04:48.566 --> 02:04:51.569
Everything is grist for your mill, isn't it

02:04:51.569 --> 02:04:53.571
Well, go ahead, grind it up--

02:04:53.571 --> 02:04:56.574
Brady's past, Cates' future.

02:04:56.574 --> 02:05:00.078
My god, don't you understand

02:05:00.078 --> 02:05:02.580
the meaning of what happened here today

02:05:03.081 --> 02:05:04.582
What happened here today has no meaning.

02:05:05.083 --> 02:05:06.084
You have no meaning.

02:05:06.084 --> 02:05:08.586
You're like a ghost pointing an empty sleeve

02:05:08.586 --> 02:05:10.588
and smirking at everything

02:05:10.588 --> 02:05:14.592
that people feel or want or struggle for.

02:05:16.594 --> 02:05:18.096
I pity you.

02:05:18.596 --> 02:05:19.597
You pity me

02:05:19.597 --> 02:05:21.099
Isn't there anything...

02:05:21.099 --> 02:05:24.602
what touches you what warms you

02:05:25.603 --> 02:05:27.105
Every man has a dream.

02:05:27.105 --> 02:05:28.606
what do you dream about

02:05:28.606 --> 02:05:30.108
what--what do you need

02:05:32.110 --> 02:05:34.112
you don't need anything, do you

02:05:34.612 --> 02:05:38.616
people-- love-- an idea, just to cling to

02:05:41.119 --> 02:05:42.620
you poor slob.

02:05:44.122 --> 02:05:45.623
you're all alone.

02:05:47.625 --> 02:05:49.627
When you go to your grave, there won't be anybody

02:05:49.627 --> 02:05:52.130
to pull the grass up over your head,

02:05:52.630 --> 02:05:55.633
nobody to mourn you, nobody to give a damn.

02:05:58.136 --> 02:05:59.637
You're all alone.

02:06:10.648 --> 02:06:12.150
You're wrong, Henry.

02:06:13.651 --> 02:06:15.153
You'll be there.

02:06:16.154 --> 02:06:17.655
You're the type.

02:06:19.157 --> 02:06:22.160
Who else would defend my right to be lonely

02:06:49.187 --> 02:06:52.690
[Sighing]

02:07:05.203 --> 02:07:08.706
...of the coming of the lord

02:07:08.706 --> 02:07:11.709
He is trampling out the vintage

02:07:11.709 --> 02:07:14.712
Where the grapes of wrath are stored

02:07:14.712 --> 02:07:17.715
He hath loosed the fateful lightning

02:07:17.715 --> 02:07:20.718
of his terrible swift sword

02:07:20.718 --> 02:07:25.723
His truth is marching on

02:07:27.225 --> 02:07:32.730
Glory! Glory!
Hallelujah

02:07:32.730 --> 02:07:38.236
Glory! Glory!
Hallelujah

02:07:38.236 --> 02:07:43.241
Glory! Glory!
Hallelujah
