WEBVTT

00:25.734 --> 00:26.734
Illumination!

00:26.902 --> 00:29.315
Yeah! Illumination!

00:29.446 --> 00:31.233
Whoo!

00:34.409 --> 00:35.775
- Huh?
- Oh, man.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.701
Aw.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.070
Hmm. Wow.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.737
<i>Past the place
that you come from,</i>

01:18.120 --> 01:20.237
<i>far beyond what you've seen,</i>

01:20.414 --> 01:22.531
<i>is a town like your town</i>

01:22.708 --> 01:25.041
<i>if your town was a dream.</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:35.836
<i>Only it's not a dream
or a hoax or a ruse.</i>

01:35.929 --> 01:36.929
Morning!

01:37.014 --> 01:38.550
<i>It is Christmas
in Who-ville,</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:40.389
<i>the home of the Whos.</i>

01:40.726 --> 01:41.933
Fresh peppermint bread.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.183
Oh, hey, Marge.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.681
Morning, Fred.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.229
Smells like Christmas.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.436
Whoa!

01:52.529 --> 01:53.770
Where are you going?

01:55.657 --> 01:57.819
- Hey, Tom.
- Good to see you, Ted.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.031
Wreath Man, Wreath Man!

02:01.121 --> 02:03.909
- Here you go, kid, have a wreath.
- Oh, cool!

02:03.999 --> 02:05.351
Merry Christmas to you.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.328
- Have a great day, dear.
- You too, hon. See you tonight!

02:09.420 --> 02:11.083
- Hurry up!
- Okay!

02:26.188 --> 02:29.977
<i>Yes, Who-ville is great,
that is known far and wide</i>

02:30.359 --> 02:34.569
<i>and three weeks through December,
this place hits its stride.</i>

02:50.504 --> 02:54.714
<i>Yes, the Whos down
in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot.</i>

02:58.220 --> 03:02.385
<i>But the Grinch,
in his cave north of Who-ville,</i>

03:02.766 --> 03:03.973
<i>did not.</i>

03:23.995 --> 03:25.987
Hmm?

03:44.015 --> 03:45.015
Hmm.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.562
Max!

03:55.819 --> 03:56.819
Max!

05:35.961 --> 05:37.122
Ooh!

05:37.337 --> 05:39.203
I am starving.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.297
Huh?

05:41.174 --> 05:44.508
Max, what is this
depressing bean?

05:44.678 --> 05:45.885
No, no, no.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.137
That's impossible.
We can't be out of food.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.140
Wha...

05:50.225 --> 05:53.468
Where's my personal reserve
of moose juice? And goose juice?

05:53.645 --> 05:55.682
My emergency stash of Who Hash?

05:55.856 --> 05:59.099
And my secret slew
of frozen Beezle-Nut stew?

06:00.360 --> 06:03.649
I specifically bought enough
food to last until January.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.235
How much emotional eating
have I been doing?

06:15.166 --> 06:17.123
No, I won't. I will not.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.623
I am not going
to Who-ville during...

06:23.592 --> 06:24.592
Christmas!

06:25.760 --> 06:26.760
Ugh!

06:30.432 --> 06:31.513
Fine.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.304
But I'm gonna despise
every second of it.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.512
Come on, Max.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.810
<i>Yes,
the Grinch hated Christmas,</i>

06:41.234 --> 06:43.772
<i>the whole Christmas season.</i>

06:43.945 --> 06:46.028
<i>Now, please don't ask why.</i>

06:46.406 --> 06:48.068
<i>No one quite knows the reason.</i>

06:49.034 --> 06:52.277
<i>It could be his head wasn't screwed
on just right.</i> -

06:53.538 --> 06:56.531
<i>It could be, perhaps, that his shoes
were too tight.</i> -

06:58.418 --> 07:01.411
<i>But I think the most likely
reason of all</i>

07:01.588 --> 07:06.925
<i>may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.</i>

07:13.224 --> 07:14.431
Now, remember, Max,

07:14.601 --> 07:18.390
this is the time of year when
the Whos are at their most deceptive.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.388
You have my full permission

07:20.565 --> 07:24.309
to attack anyone who so much as
says one kind word to us.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.854
Okay, let's go.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.491
Good to see you.
How's work?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.820
Hi. Merry Christmas.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.660
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold the bus!

07:39.250 --> 07:40.866
- Wait, stop. Oh!
- Whoa!

07:40.961 --> 07:42.077
- Coming through.
- Hey!

07:43.797 --> 07:46.210
Wait! Wait! Sam!
Hold the bus!

07:46.341 --> 07:47.627
Oh!

07:48.259 --> 07:49.340
Whoa!

07:49.427 --> 07:50.543
Whoo!

07:50.637 --> 07:52.970
- Sorry, Donna.
- That's okay, Sam.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.099
Thanks for stopping.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.185
Whoo!

07:58.269 --> 08:00.431
They've still got you
on the night shift, huh?

08:00.605 --> 08:01.686
Sure do.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.684
Oh, by the way, Cindy-Lou
forgot her hockey stick.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.239
<i>Jingle bells
Christmas smells</i>

08:12.409 --> 08:13.525
Hmm.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.620
Oh!

08:16.705 --> 08:18.571
Thanks, mister.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.915
Ha!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.457
Hey!

08:24.838 --> 08:26.875
You're a mean one, mister.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.675
It's really such an awful day.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.592
Hey! Merry Christmas.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.171
Happy holidays, Sue.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.010
Morning, Fred.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.765
Season's greetings, folks.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.928
- And merry Christmas to you!
- Ooh!

08:59.205 --> 09:00.205
Huh?

09:49.547 --> 09:51.755
- Oh, hello! Happy...
- Uh-uh!

10:17.909 --> 10:19.571
Huh. What's this?

10:20.495 --> 10:22.578
Excuse me?
Are you getting that?

10:22.747 --> 10:25.615
I need it for my Christmas stuffing.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.825
Mmm... No.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.745
Well, that's not very nice.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.833
Oh, sugarplum!

10:42.058 --> 10:45.472
Ugh. No, I can't today.
I have a list of errands a mile long

10:45.645 --> 10:47.807
and the babysitter left
the sink backed up.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.935
No, I'm not complaining.
I'm venting. There's a difference.

10:51.109 --> 10:54.398
Okay. Talk to you later.
I have to get breakfast on the table.

10:54.571 --> 10:58.565
Right after I unclog
this drain again!

10:58.658 --> 11:00.570
Ugh! It's like concrete.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.735
Cindy-Lou.
Sweetheart, come eat.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.889
Coming!

11:10.420 --> 11:13.709
Buster, we've talked about this.
Your brother's head is not breakfast.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.428
Bleh!

11:30.982 --> 11:32.268
Ugh.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.853
Okay.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.108
You all right, Mom?

11:35.695 --> 11:38.483
Me? Oh, yes. Never better.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.690
What'd you put down here,
anyway? A roller skate?

11:40.909 --> 11:43.697
No. Just batter.
Me and Ms. Wilbur made cookies.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.361
Oh, that explains it.
Come have some eggs.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.489
I can't, I gotta go
mail something.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.575
But I made the beds
and put away the twins' toys.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.544
Thanks, sweetheart.
You didn't have to do that.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.375
I don't mind.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.878
- Something's burning.
- Just a second, sweetie.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.924
Bean, don't feed your brother
with your feet.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.422
Mom! The toast!

12:01.596 --> 12:02.882
I got it.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.309
Wait, where are you
going again?

12:13.483 --> 12:15.395
I told you,
to mail a letter.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.184
Okay, but just
come here first.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.069
Mom, I gotta go.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.482
All right.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.284
Muah.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.820
Okay. Now you can go.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.659
Thanks, Mom.
Bye, Buster. Bye, Bean.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.243
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do!

12:31.417 --> 12:33.249
Roger that, Mom!

12:33.461 --> 12:34.461
Whoo!

12:36.256 --> 12:39.340
And here goes Cindy-Lou Who,
as she dashes through the snow

12:39.425 --> 12:41.462
with a very important letter.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.969
Oh, no! I'm gonna
miss the mailman!

12:44.138 --> 12:45.970
Short cut!

12:46.349 --> 12:47.806
Go, go, go!

12:48.518 --> 12:50.009
Whoo!

12:52.855 --> 12:54.141
Oh, boy.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.396
Bon appÃ©tit!

12:55.566 --> 12:56.682
Whoo-hoo!

12:58.945 --> 13:00.436
Oh, no!

13:00.780 --> 13:01.780
Whoo!

13:04.158 --> 13:05.569
Watch out!

13:07.704 --> 13:09.195
No! My letter!

13:09.330 --> 13:11.617
Argh! What is wrong with you?
Didn't you see me?

13:11.708 --> 13:14.371
I mean, if that was a sled,
well, I'd be dead.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.624
I'm sorry for bumping into you,
but this is really important.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.706
Have you seen my letter?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.758
And that right there, Max,
is the true nature of the Who child.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.506
Just right to "Me, me, me.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.053
- "My letter. Me, me, me."
- No! You don't understand.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.133
This isn't just a letter,
this is the letter.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.060
Oh, really? Let me guess.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.515
Small child, December 20th,

13:34.605 --> 13:37.564
rabidly searching for
a "really important" lost letter.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.734
Might it be your
list of demands to Santa?

13:40.903 --> 13:43.691
They're not demands.
It's more like a wish.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.324
And what I'm wishing for
is really, really important.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.595
Well then, why send a letter?

13:48.619 --> 13:51.953
I mean, if it's really that important
you should just ask him face-to-face.

13:52.123 --> 13:56.037
Oh, but that's right.
No one's ever seen him.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.126
Mmm, my bad.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.538
Come on, Max,
let's get out of here.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.547
Bye, doggy.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.270
<i>Have a holly, jolly Christmas</i>

14:16.439 --> 14:18.977
<i>It's the best time
of the year</i>

14:19.150 --> 14:20.607
There he is, Max.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.148
The happiest Who alive.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.689
The unbearable Bricklebaum.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.109
He thinks we're friends.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.028
Quick, let's make a run for it.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.118
<i>I don't know
if there'll be snow</i>

14:35.208 --> 14:36.744
What... What was that?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.291
No.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.244
<i>But have a cup of cheer</i>

14:45.843 --> 14:48.506
<i>Say hello to friends
you know</i>

14:48.596 --> 14:51.179
<i>And everyone you meet</i>

14:58.731 --> 15:01.895
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Grinch!
I'm coming.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.354
Leave Mr. Grinch alone.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.506
That's one tough balloon
that you're fighting there,

15:05.530 --> 15:08.273
you old feisty frosty. Here,
come on. Let me help you up.

15:08.366 --> 15:11.200
I do not want,
or need, your help.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.860
Oh. "Hair dye.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.662
"Gorgeous Green Goddess."

15:16.040 --> 15:17.372
Oh. How did that
get in there?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.495
Hey, I'm sorry
if I made you uncomfy.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.827
We all gotta keep
the gray away.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.839
- I myself use Chocolate Explosion.
- You know what?

15:26.008 --> 15:29.501
If you want to apologize for
something, apologize for that!

15:30.596 --> 15:33.213
My eyes are burning.

15:33.391 --> 15:36.099
Don't blame me.
Haven't you heard?

15:36.185 --> 15:39.098
The mayor wants Christmas to be
three times bigger this year.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.982
That means three times the lights,
three times the eggnog, three times the...

15:43.151 --> 15:47.270
- Information needed.
- Ha-ha! That's a good one.

15:47.447 --> 15:51.157
Oh, I get it.
This is one of your kidding things.

15:51.242 --> 15:54.906
Finally, something you said
is actually funny.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.786
Yeah, I do kid a lot,

15:56.873 --> 15:59.957
- but, no, this is actually...
- Christmas three times bigger!

16:00.126 --> 16:02.312
Well, you're just gonna have a good time
with this, aren't you?

16:02.336 --> 16:04.828
I gotta say, it's really nice
to see you laughing.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.379
Sorry, I can't hear you.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.791
I don't speak ridiculous.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.343
Oh, you're a scream!
Have a nice life. Goodbye.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.715
I'll see you later.

16:12.847 --> 16:16.386
Whoo! Oh, man.
Mr. Grinch. Oh.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.924
<i>From the edge of
his ledge way up in the sky</i>

16:59.769 --> 17:03.809
<i>the Grinch felt upset,
though he wasn't sure why.</i>

17:04.482 --> 17:08.476
<i>It could've been Christmas,
all thatjoy and the such</i>

17:08.653 --> 17:13.489
<i>or some thoughts from his past
that he just couldn't quite touch.</i>

17:13.866 --> 17:18.156
<i>But whatever it was, it made
his heart moan.</i> -

17:19.247 --> 17:22.866
<i>Though he was used to it now,
this being alone.</i>

17:24.001 --> 17:28.086
<i>And now safe in his cave,
and apart from the fray,</i>

17:28.839 --> 17:31.422
<i>he reminded himself...</i>

17:31.509 --> 17:33.375
It is better this way.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.062
That's right, yeah.
Just right there.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.562
No. No.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.695
Whoa!

17:57.785 --> 18:00.243
- Cindy-Lou!
- Don't worry, Mom!

18:09.088 --> 18:11.580
I'm wearing four ski jackets.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.794
Four jackets?
Aren't you a little hot?

18:14.051 --> 18:16.464
Yep.
Sweating a little bit.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.171
- Are you going somewhere?
- North Pole.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.258
Oh, wow!
Any, uh, particular reason?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.809
- I gotta talk to Santa.
- Santa, huh?

18:24.895 --> 18:27.763
Yeah. It's really important.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.148
Well, it must be if you need to go
see him in person.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.731
- It sure is.
- Okay, then. Well, good luck

18:32.903 --> 18:35.737
and I guess I'll see you
in about a month.

18:35.823 --> 18:36.939
Wait.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.242
It takes a whole month
to get to the North Pole?

18:40.911 --> 18:42.447
Oh, yeah. At least.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.160
Christmas will be over
by the time I got there.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.365
Ah, that's true.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.416
Now, we would miss you
at Christmas.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.413
Wow, I guess I'm gonna have to
come up with another plan.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.299
Hey, maybe while you're thinking,
you could put the halo on the angel.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.377
Okay.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.388
You wanna take your jackets off?

19:01.474 --> 19:03.136
Yeah, at least
one or two of them.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.178
No, boys. Don't pull
the angel's wings off.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.271
She needs those.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.239
So, uh...

19:27.958 --> 19:29.449
What do you wanna do today?

19:38.886 --> 19:40.343
No idea, huh?

19:41.138 --> 19:43.255
Ooh, I got one.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.907
All right, all right.
I'm sorry.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.450
You're a good dog.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.457
But a bad drummer.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.376
What would you like to do?

21:01.761 --> 21:05.801
More than embarrassing
to be beaten by a dog.

21:07.475 --> 21:08.966
Oh, what's that?

21:12.480 --> 21:15.223
And checkmate! Again.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.819
What in the world is happening?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.332
What is that?

21:42.510 --> 21:45.969
It's the most beautiful Christmas tree
you've ever seen.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.297
Three times bigger?

21:48.390 --> 21:50.723
That's a hundred times bigger!

21:50.851 --> 21:52.888
Oh, you just wait
till we light it tonight.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.473
It'll sparkle so bright

21:54.563 --> 21:57.931
you'll be celebrating Christmas
with the rest of us. Ho-ho!

22:00.027 --> 22:01.484
Oh, man! I can't wait.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.020
I'm gonna keep at it.

22:03.197 --> 22:05.234
- I'll see you later, Grinchy!
- No!

22:05.407 --> 22:09.026
You will not see me later,
and I will not be celebrating.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.701
And that tree,

22:11.121 --> 22:13.704
that tree

22:14.708 --> 22:17.917
has got to go.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.472
Come on, Mom.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.890
Cindy-Lou, look over there.

22:37.231 --> 22:40.599
- Wow! That's amazing!
- Thank you!

22:41.861 --> 22:44.148
Ooh, a three-eyed sock monster!

22:44.321 --> 22:46.062
Awesome robot!

22:46.407 --> 22:49.775
<i>Oh, how marvelous
this time of year is.</i>

22:49.952 --> 22:55.038
<i>Welcome, Who-ville,
to the annual tree-lighting ceremony.</i>

22:55.165 --> 22:58.784
<i>How spectacular
are these ornaments?</i>

22:59.670 --> 23:02.754
Look what I made, everybody.
It's a Christmas dragon.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.752
It came to me in a dream.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.208
Oh, man!

23:08.929 --> 23:11.262
- Hey, Bartholomew!
- Hey there, Ms. Who.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.180
- Here you go!
- Got it!

23:13.350 --> 23:15.216
Find a good spot for it.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.181
There it goes.

23:29.700 --> 23:34.035
<i>Now, let's get ready
to flip that switch and light up the sky.</i>

23:34.121 --> 23:38.491
Oh, no!
Not on my watch, you don't.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.624
See you guys soon!
I'm gonna go find Groopert.

23:40.711 --> 23:43.169
Okay. Have fun. Bye. Say bye.

23:43.339 --> 23:46.707
Here you go. I hope your big
brother gets what he deserves.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.758
Hey, Groopert,
how's business?

23:48.844 --> 23:52.178
Good. What I can't sell
I can always eat.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.801
I need to talk to you about
something really important.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.760
- Okay.
- Come on. Let's go.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.479
All right,
check this out, Groopert.

24:06.236 --> 24:10.196
I'm gonna stay up on Christmas Eve
this year and meet Santa Claus.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.899
Whoa, that is crazy!

24:12.993 --> 24:14.950
Yeah, I really gotta
talk to him.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.494
About what?

24:16.664 --> 24:18.781
Well, it's really personal.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.577
But I'm going to tell you
because you're my best friend.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.036
It's about my mom.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.832
She works all night
and takes care of us all day.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.883
And it just isn't fair.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.220
She acts like she's fine,

24:34.473 --> 24:37.090
but I know
it's really hard for her.

24:38.769 --> 24:42.012
So I figured if anyone
could fix that, it'd be Santa.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.232
Wow.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.061
And I just asked him
for a turtle.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.358
<i>Here we go!</i>

24:47.695 --> 24:49.277
Oh, it's starting.

24:49.488 --> 24:54.153
<i>Okay, Who-ville, it is time
to light this beautiful tree.</i>

24:54.326 --> 24:58.491
...17, 18, 19 and 20.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.575
Okay, lock and load.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.962
All right,
just attach this here

25:08.048 --> 25:10.415
and we'll be ready to launch.

25:13.470 --> 25:17.680
I know! I wish I could see
the look on their faces.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.344
Whoa!

25:20.436 --> 25:21.847
Whoa!

25:29.236 --> 25:30.647
Okay. Oh, boy!

25:33.907 --> 25:35.398
Wow.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.116
That could be so much worse.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.114
<i>Let's begin the countdown.</i>

25:44.543 --> 25:45.543
Ten,

25:45.753 --> 25:47.244
nine,

25:47.421 --> 25:49.959
eight, seven,

25:50.132 --> 25:52.215
six, five,

25:52.384 --> 25:55.252
four, three, two...

25:55.345 --> 25:57.462
Hey! My dragon can fly!

25:57.639 --> 25:59.130
...one!

26:01.769 --> 26:03.260
Oh, my!

26:03.437 --> 26:04.848
No, no, no!

26:05.022 --> 26:06.934
No, no!

26:17.284 --> 26:18.695
- Whoa!
- Wow!

26:21.080 --> 26:22.161
Oh, it's beautiful.

26:22.331 --> 26:28.202
<i>There it is, the most beautiful tree
Who-ville has ever seen.</i>

26:29.296 --> 26:31.037
No! No!

26:39.932 --> 26:41.969
No!

26:42.976 --> 26:44.262
No, no.

26:44.645 --> 26:48.184
<i>He walked through
the crowd and the sound, and the lights.</i>

26:49.066 --> 26:52.980
<i>And his ears heard the thump
of theirjoy and delights.</i>

26:53.737 --> 26:57.230
<i>And it took him right back
to his earliest years,</i>

26:57.658 --> 27:02.323
<i>to that lost, lonely boy
who cried all of those tears.</i>

27:03.372 --> 27:07.332
<i>That lost, lonely boy,
isolated and sad</i>

27:07.543 --> 27:13.039
<i>with no home of his own,
no mom and no dad.</i>

27:18.137 --> 27:22.723
<i>And as the Grinch looked around,
he felt downright scared</i>

27:24.393 --> 27:28.808
<i>as he remembered that Christmas
where nobody cared.</i>

27:30.149 --> 27:33.563
<i>Where nobody showed,
not even a flea,</i>

27:34.069 --> 27:38.404
<i>and there were no cards,
no gifts, and no tree.</i>

27:43.495 --> 27:45.327
<i>And as he watched other kids,</i>

27:46.456 --> 27:48.618
<i>one thing became clear,</i>

27:50.752 --> 27:54.746
<i>that this was
the single worst day of the year.</i>

27:58.051 --> 28:00.543
<i>And now here it was,
that day once again</i>

28:00.721 --> 28:03.930
<i>when he felt all those feelings
he felt way back when.</i>

28:04.183 --> 28:08.097
<i>When he'd watch
Whos young and old all sit down to feast,</i>

28:08.270 --> 28:10.011
<i>and they'd feast,
and they'd feast,</i>

28:10.189 --> 28:12.602
<i>and they'd feast, feast,
feast, feast.</i>

28:13.775 --> 28:18.110
<i>They'd feast on Who-pudding,
and rare Who roast beast.</i>

28:18.864 --> 28:22.949
<i>Which is something the Grinch
could not stand in the least.</i>

28:24.328 --> 28:28.163
<i>And then they'd do something
he liked least of all.</i>

28:28.373 --> 28:31.081
<i>Every Who down in Who-ville,
the tall and the small,</i>

28:31.168 --> 28:34.627
<i>would stand close together
with Christmas bells ringing.</i>

28:34.755 --> 28:39.170
<i>They'd stand hand-in-hand
and the Whos would start singing.</i>

29:00.280 --> 29:03.239
They'll sing, and they'll sing,

29:03.408 --> 29:06.651
and they'll sing,
sing, sing, sing.

29:06.828 --> 29:11.072
<i>Yes, he couldn't recall
without feeling the sting.</i>

29:11.500 --> 29:14.038
<i>So the Grinch
finally declared...</i>

29:14.253 --> 29:17.587
I must stop this whole thing.

29:28.725 --> 29:29.725
Why?

29:29.893 --> 29:33.136
For 53 years
I've put up with it.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.934
Now...

29:35.440 --> 29:39.150
I must stop this Christmas
from coming,

29:40.070 --> 29:41.436
but how?

29:49.496 --> 29:51.112
<i>Then he got an idea,</i>

29:52.374 --> 29:54.536
<i>an awful idea.</i>

29:54.751 --> 29:58.961
<i>The Grinch got
a wonderful, awful idea.</i>

29:59.131 --> 30:02.465
I know just what to do.

30:04.052 --> 30:08.888
I'm going to
steal their Christmas.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.101
All the trimmings.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.187
All the trappings.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.020
All their gifts and garlands.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.813
When they wake
and see it's gone

30:25.907 --> 30:30.493
then all their joy and happiness
will be gone as well.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.705
So prepare yourself, Max.

30:34.875 --> 30:38.744
For, tomorrow we begin.

31:20.629 --> 31:23.042
Genius starts
with the abs, Max.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.299
It's go time.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.351
And now,

31:37.562 --> 31:40.350
the question we have
all been waiting for.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.729
How will I steal Christmas?

31:43.819 --> 31:49.065
Well, prepare to have your
little doggy mind blown. Poof.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.251
Ta-da!
That's right.

32:02.337 --> 32:06.957
I become Santa Claus.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.335
But instead of giving
all the joy and happiness,

32:10.470 --> 32:12.052
I'll take it away.

32:12.139 --> 32:15.598
If he can deliver Christmas
to the whole world in one night,

32:15.684 --> 32:19.894
then I can certainly steal it
from little old Who-ville.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.887
I mean, come on,

32:22.107 --> 32:24.520
what's Santa have that I don't?

32:26.695 --> 32:28.027
That's hurtful.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.531
Um, what are you doing
with my bowling ball?

32:32.701 --> 32:33.908
Chasing it.

32:34.411 --> 32:37.495
- And you're taking it where?
- It's a secret.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.160
All right, but not without breakfast. Catch.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.496
Whoa, waffles, my favorite!

32:43.211 --> 32:44.918
Thanks! See you guys later!

32:45.046 --> 32:46.708
Here we go.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.341
- Hey, Cindy-Lou!
- Oh, hey there, Mr. Cubbins.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.351
- Ready.
- All right. Let's go.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.072
Hold on!

33:19.080 --> 33:20.080
Whoo!

33:20.749 --> 33:21.830
Yeah!

33:29.007 --> 33:30.873
Let's go, let's go.
Let's move.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.301
Hang on! Whoo!

33:37.432 --> 33:39.264
And dismount.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.648
So, what do we know?

33:48.818 --> 33:50.730
Waffles are delicious.

33:50.946 --> 33:51.982
Super delicious.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.029
But I meant about meeting Santa.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.947
We know
no one's ever done it.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.117
Hmm...

33:57.452 --> 33:59.409
Okay. How about this?

33:59.538 --> 34:03.908
I'm gonna sit in the living room
with my eyes wide open, like this,

34:04.084 --> 34:05.620
and if I start to drift off,

34:05.710 --> 34:07.827
I'll just open them wider!

34:08.004 --> 34:10.792
I'm pretty sure
you're gonna fall asleep.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.172
And by the time
you wake up...

34:12.342 --> 34:13.422
He'll be gone.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.752
Nothing but cookie crumbs.

34:15.929 --> 34:17.465
Yeah, you're right.

34:18.348 --> 34:20.010
- I got it.
- Tell me!

34:20.183 --> 34:21.424
Maple syrup.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.342
All right, maple syrup.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.476
We pour it on the roof,
the reindeer get stuck

34:25.563 --> 34:27.226
and then they can't fly away.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.639
Science!

34:28.817 --> 34:30.433
Won't the syrup just freeze?

34:30.652 --> 34:31.652
Good point.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.023
Also, how do we get all that
syrup on the roof?

34:34.239 --> 34:35.855
Yeah, I got nothing.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.619
Wait a minute.
I think I got it.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.491
What?

34:43.998 --> 34:46.491
We're gonna need the whole gang
for this one.

34:47.877 --> 34:52.746
Okay. If I'm gonna become Santa,
then I need to get into character.

34:54.384 --> 34:57.252
All right. Let's see.
"Christmas tree,

34:57.345 --> 34:59.758
"Christmas traditions,
Christmas pudding."

34:59.931 --> 35:01.731
How does pudding
work its way into everything?

35:01.850 --> 35:03.807
Where is the Santa stuff?

35:03.977 --> 35:08.221
Look at this, little girls and
boys giggling over sugarplums.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.481
Oh.

35:09.566 --> 35:14.607
Look how they did the roof
of the gingerbread house with vanilla icing.

35:14.696 --> 35:17.439
Hmm. Little family of gumdrops.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.243
Huh. So dumb.
So, so stupidly dumb.

35:24.414 --> 35:25.575
Ah, here we are!

35:25.790 --> 35:27.156
"The Legend of Santa Claus.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.166
"Red suit, white beard.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.669
"Always in a jolly mood."

35:32.297 --> 35:33.297
Oh.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.747
That's not gonna happen.

35:34.924 --> 35:38.042
Oh, well. Let's just start
by finding ourselves some reindeer.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.970
Beautiful, isn't it, Max?

35:49.147 --> 35:53.107
This, my little friend,
is the Rein-Horn.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.482
It perfectly recreates
the mating call of the reindeer.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.816
Behold.

36:07.165 --> 36:11.159
Oh. Hey, there.
Sorry, little goat. I was calling for a...

36:13.838 --> 36:16.251
What was that?
Scram! Skedaddle!

36:16.966 --> 36:18.173
Strange goat.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.385
Now, reindeer migrate,

36:22.472 --> 36:25.010
so maybe we'll catch a few
headed south for the winter.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.849
I also read that they tend to
mate in densely wooded...

36:27.936 --> 36:30.644
Will you stop following us?

36:30.814 --> 36:32.976
Shoo! Away!
Go back to the goat farm!

36:33.149 --> 36:34.765
Go eat a can.

36:37.487 --> 36:41.151
All right, now that that's over,
back to the task at hand.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.695
Whoo. It's a little crisp.

36:44.327 --> 36:48.071
Oh, it's getting really cold.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.455
Oh, goodness!

36:50.750 --> 36:54.664
Can't feel my lips!

36:55.171 --> 36:56.787
Can't blink.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.173
Eyes frozen!

37:03.513 --> 37:05.004
Max,

37:05.181 --> 37:08.015
we've hit the mother lode.

37:08.351 --> 37:12.641
We'll have
100 reindeer to pull our...

37:26.202 --> 37:27.202
Huh?

37:31.791 --> 37:34.078
Well, Santa had eight.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.460
He looks like
he ate the other seven.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.330
Watch and learn, Max.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.129
All right.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.590
Frozen, stinking...

38:27.680 --> 38:29.137
Stop, stop.

38:30.767 --> 38:33.180
Onward, my furry friends.

38:33.353 --> 38:36.016
We're walking toward destiny.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.943
All right,
you called, we came.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.869
- So what's up?
- Yeah, what's the deal?

38:53.039 --> 38:54.826
Thanks for getting here
so fast, guys.

38:54.916 --> 38:55.952
Follow me.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.957
So what's the big secret?

39:01.047 --> 39:03.915
Yeah, I don't have very long.
My parents set the timer.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.295
- Dude.
- Don't ask. It's new.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.504
All right, everybody,
brace yourselves.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.805
In exactly 48 hours

39:11.975 --> 39:16.766
we're going to do something
that's never been done before.

39:16.855 --> 39:21.065
We're gonna trap Santa Claus!

39:27.031 --> 39:28.192
Trap Santa?

39:28.408 --> 39:29.774
Why would we wanna do that?

39:29.868 --> 39:31.985
Duh. To steal all his toys.
I love it.

39:32.078 --> 39:35.116
- That's a great idea.
- Not to steal his toys.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.790
To, um...
To talk to him.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.038
What? Why'd you wanna
talk to him?

39:40.128 --> 39:42.745
- It's personal.
- Yeah, it's kinda personal.

39:42.839 --> 39:45.297
Well, I don't wanna do it
if you won't tell me why.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.124
What are you talking about,
"personal"?

39:47.302 --> 39:50.841
Axl, when you asked to borrow
$16 and my mom's suitcase,

39:50.930 --> 39:52.671
did I ask you why?

39:52.765 --> 39:53.765
No.

39:53.850 --> 39:56.388
And what about you, Ozzy?
Remember when you got stuck in that...

39:56.477 --> 39:58.309
All right, all right,
okay. Jeez.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.103
I did it because
you're my friend.

40:00.189 --> 40:04.024
And when something matters to you,
that means it matters to me.

40:05.737 --> 40:06.818
That's beautiful.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.238
Okay, okay, okay.
You convinced me.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.361
- Count me in, too.
- All right, we're in.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.033
Great! Now let's do this.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.014
- Yeah, let's do this!
- Let's make it happen. Awesome.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.119
Cool. That is so cool.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.905
To the bikes.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.985
- Cindy-Lou, dinner time!
- Come here, guys, dinner time!

40:28.009 --> 40:29.320
- Time to eat!
- Ooh, dinner.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.336
All right, we meet
first thing in the morning.

40:31.471 --> 40:32.552
- Okay.
- All right.

40:32.639 --> 40:33.991
- See you tomorrow.
- See you guys in the morning.

40:34.015 --> 40:36.723
- Ozzy, timer!
- Okay, Mom!

40:52.367 --> 40:56.077
This is the loudest snow
I've ever heard in my life.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.282
You two, go around the back.

40:58.373 --> 41:01.616
Wait for me to drop the sleigh
from the roof. Okay?

41:03.628 --> 41:04.960
Go, team.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.479
What? What's going on?

42:08.151 --> 42:11.315
Hey! Who taught Mabel
how to use the doorbell?

42:11.404 --> 42:12.565
Man, that's awesome.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.688
You smart little dog.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.575
<i>Holy infant</i>

42:26.669 --> 42:28.376
Huh? What's this?

42:28.546 --> 42:32.631
<i>So tender and mild</i>

42:33.301 --> 42:39.263
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

42:41.976 --> 42:46.095
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

42:52.945 --> 42:54.607
All right, here it comes.

42:54.697 --> 42:55.858
Get ready.

43:11.422 --> 43:12.958
Oh!

43:13.132 --> 43:15.715
Oh, look at that.
Mabel is delivering cakes now.

43:15.802 --> 43:18.215
I mean, is this the best
Christmas or what?

43:30.024 --> 43:31.936
Ooh! Holy moly!

43:34.070 --> 43:35.777
Man, I don't know
what's in this cake,

43:35.863 --> 43:38.480
but I think I just saw
Santa Claus.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.573
Let me get another piece.

43:45.123 --> 43:47.536
Today was great!

43:47.959 --> 43:51.498
We did mean things
and we did them in style.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.124
Max,

43:54.298 --> 43:55.755
you know the rules.

43:55.925 --> 43:58.713
You sleep in your bed,
and I sleep in...

44:00.805 --> 44:03.297
Oh, no, no, not you, too.
I don't believe this.

44:03.391 --> 44:05.132
Max, did you teach him
puppy eyes?

44:11.899 --> 44:14.607
Fine. This one time.

45:36.734 --> 45:41.229
Mmm. Now that is
a great cup of coffee!

45:44.659 --> 45:48.027
Max, this morning, you and I
need to do some recon.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.453
Fred, you just sit right there.

45:50.790 --> 45:52.873
And don't touch anything!

45:54.085 --> 45:56.498
Intel, Max,
that's what we're after.

45:56.587 --> 45:59.580
How many houses are in Who-ville
and how many Whos?

45:59.674 --> 46:02.883
How many wreaths
and trees and chimney flues?

46:03.427 --> 46:06.465
I'll be in your ear the whole time,
and whatever you're seeing

46:06.639 --> 46:08.505
<i>I'll be seeing on the monitor.</i>

46:08.683 --> 46:10.891
Ready? Now off you go, Max.

46:10.977 --> 46:12.263
Fly, boy!

46:12.436 --> 46:13.643
Fly!

46:22.363 --> 46:25.322
Max, stop socializing!

46:26.158 --> 46:28.866
<i>Now, let's go in for a look.</i>

46:30.204 --> 46:31.240
<i>Okay.</i>

46:31.414 --> 46:33.906
Six houses on Oak Street...
Oh, watch out!

46:34.083 --> 46:35.415
What?

46:36.002 --> 46:37.002
Oh.

46:37.086 --> 46:38.952
<i>Okay. Go, go, go, go!</i>

46:39.130 --> 46:41.338
Now cut through Main Street
and survey the south side.

46:42.925 --> 46:45.087
<i>Look at those
greedy little gift monsters.</i>

46:45.261 --> 46:48.550
Loading themselves up
with Christmas junk.

46:49.307 --> 46:51.014
<i>Okay, Max, turn right here.</i>

46:51.183 --> 46:53.550
So I woke up this morning,
got dressed, had my coffee,

46:53.728 --> 46:55.008
<i>went outside,
looked on the roof.</i>

46:55.062 --> 46:56.678
<i>My sleigh was gone.</i>

46:56.856 --> 46:58.688
My, my, I wonder who took it.

46:58.899 --> 47:00.140
Huh?

47:00.443 --> 47:02.309
<i>Okay, let's see here.</i>

47:02.486 --> 47:06.480
If we do 28 houses an hour for six hours,
that would be sausages.

47:06.574 --> 47:07.655
Sausages?

47:07.825 --> 47:09.862
<i>Max! Don't even think about it.</i>

47:14.540 --> 47:15.997
Max!

47:19.003 --> 47:20.039
Max, are you okay?

47:20.212 --> 47:21.623
<i>Max?</i>

47:21.797 --> 47:22.958
Oh, hey, look, it's me.

47:23.132 --> 47:24.498
Oh, dear.

47:25.426 --> 47:27.588
Bad dog.

47:28.304 --> 47:30.671
Fred! We're home!

47:31.474 --> 47:32.931
Fred!

47:33.809 --> 47:35.550
What are you doing?

47:40.775 --> 47:42.232
Okay.

47:42.318 --> 47:44.059
Come on, we got work to do.

47:46.530 --> 47:48.897
Now, let's plan our route.

47:51.077 --> 47:52.784
First, now, we go south,

47:52.870 --> 47:54.156
quick jaunt to the east,

47:54.246 --> 47:56.954
and then this house,
skip the subdivision for the moment,

47:57.041 --> 47:59.784
knock off the entire
southeast quadrant of the town.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.493
And then we finish it all up

48:01.670 --> 48:04.162
on Whistling Who Lane.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.166
That's 223 houses

48:07.259 --> 48:09.672
and only seven hours
of darkness to work with.

48:09.762 --> 48:12.800
That means we have to be
fast and focused.

48:13.391 --> 48:16.099
And believe you me,
there will be temptation...

48:17.603 --> 48:19.060
...all around us.

48:23.442 --> 48:25.308
Behold! The present!

48:25.403 --> 48:27.440
This is our enemy.

48:27.530 --> 48:32.070
You will want to unwrap it
and play with it.

48:36.956 --> 48:38.948
Hmm. But you must not!

48:39.041 --> 48:43.411
And if you can get past the present,
the only obstacle left is

48:45.673 --> 48:47.585
the cookie.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.546
Look at it in all its red,
sugary splendor.

48:51.762 --> 48:53.879
No, no, no!
Look at yourselves!

48:53.973 --> 48:55.589
Discipline! We must...

48:59.019 --> 49:00.806
Resist.

49:02.022 --> 49:03.022
Are you ready?

49:03.107 --> 49:04.107
Almost.

49:04.275 --> 49:05.982
Good. Think jolly.

49:06.068 --> 49:07.068
And fat.

49:07.153 --> 49:08.439
Okay, I'm ready.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.148
All right, quick.
Everybody hide!

49:11.073 --> 49:12.860
Three, two, one,

49:13.033 --> 49:14.194
cue Santa!

49:15.453 --> 49:17.240
That means you, Groopert.

49:21.167 --> 49:24.251
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Look at this pretty house.

49:24.420 --> 49:26.912
I will leave presents
for the people.

49:27.006 --> 49:28.793
Come on, it's not
the school play, dude.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.419
Then why do I have to
wear the outfit?

49:30.509 --> 49:32.922
Groopert, focus!
Just get the cookie.

49:33.596 --> 49:35.428
But I can see the string.

49:35.598 --> 49:37.510
Stop worrying!
It'll be dark at night.

49:37.683 --> 49:39.424
What if he has a flashlight?

49:39.602 --> 49:41.788
Have you ever seen a picture of
Santa with a flashlight?

49:41.812 --> 49:43.348
- No, but I just...
- Groopert!

49:43.522 --> 49:45.058
Just pick up the cookie!

49:45.232 --> 49:50.102
Hmm. What do we have here?
A delicious little cookie.

49:54.742 --> 49:56.153
Groopert!

49:57.828 --> 49:59.114
Groopert?

49:59.205 --> 50:00.867
Uh, hey, guys.

50:01.540 --> 50:03.998
Do I still
get to eat the cookie?

50:07.296 --> 50:08.412
All right.

50:08.589 --> 50:12.674
So, I tinkered
with our sleigh a bit.

50:12.843 --> 50:13.924
Behold!

50:25.231 --> 50:26.312
Look at this, Max.

50:26.482 --> 50:29.225
Now you'll be riding in style.

50:29.318 --> 50:32.652
A throne for a barking prince.
How do you like that?

50:34.490 --> 50:35.490
All right, Fred,

50:35.574 --> 50:39.614
you are the engine of this
great machine. Understood?

50:39.870 --> 50:41.577
Good.

50:41.747 --> 50:43.989
Now, remember,
this is just a practice run.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.533
But on this team,
we practice like we play.

50:46.627 --> 50:48.914
So, let's leave it
all out on the snow.

50:51.549 --> 50:53.085
Whoa!

50:53.175 --> 50:54.175
Okay!

50:54.843 --> 50:56.755
All right, how about that?

50:58.472 --> 51:01.510
Now, let's pick up the pace
and see how she handles.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.388
Whoo!

51:06.188 --> 51:07.269
Hang on!

51:08.774 --> 51:10.481
No, no, no. No problem!

51:10.651 --> 51:12.438
It's all under control.

51:15.990 --> 51:16.990
Hold on!

51:24.999 --> 51:25.999
Whoa!

51:32.339 --> 51:34.706
We're doing it, Max.
We are doing it!

51:34.883 --> 51:36.875
We will not be...

51:39.346 --> 51:40.346
Stopped?

51:40.514 --> 51:41.595
What happened?

51:41.682 --> 51:42.682
Fred?

51:44.101 --> 51:45.342
Oh. Um...

51:45.436 --> 51:48.224
Sorry, but we don't need
any more reindeer.

51:48.397 --> 51:50.684
No. Go. Get. Shoo.

51:50.858 --> 51:53.191
I have what I need.

52:12.338 --> 52:13.624
It's okay, Fred.

52:32.691 --> 52:35.399
On our own again, Max.

52:42.534 --> 52:46.574
<i>It was the day before Christmas
and the Whos were abuzz,</i>

52:46.705 --> 52:50.449
<i>all doing the things
that a Christmas Who does.</i>

52:51.710 --> 52:54.919
<i>Some were out buying presents,
others just milled about.</i>

52:55.089 --> 52:56.089
There you go, sir.

52:56.173 --> 52:57.664
<i>But the whole town feltjoyous</i>

52:57.841 --> 53:00.161
<i>of that, there was no doubt.</i>

53:00.469 --> 53:04.088
<i>The weather was perfect,
and soon snow would fall.</i>

53:04.264 --> 53:05.300
<i>This surely would be...</i>

53:05.391 --> 53:06.391
Everyone ready?

53:06.475 --> 53:08.808
<i>...the best Christmas of all.</i>

53:20.406 --> 53:22.523
Max! There you are!

53:22.616 --> 53:23.902
Check this out!

53:23.992 --> 53:25.233
Whoa! Ah!

53:25.536 --> 53:27.368
I've been making
lots of cool...

53:27.538 --> 53:29.120
Whoa!

53:29.248 --> 53:30.614
Stuff.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.666
Ooh, more coffee!

53:34.294 --> 53:36.581
It's gonna be a big night.

53:36.755 --> 53:38.747
We got all the gizmos
and gazmos we need,

53:38.924 --> 53:41.416
but we still don't have
the proper outfit.

53:41.510 --> 53:44.002
Come on, let's do
a little stitching.

54:08.495 --> 54:11.203
There's only one thing
left to do.

54:14.543 --> 54:16.034
Max,

54:16.211 --> 54:17.577
do you know what you are?

54:17.880 --> 54:20.793
You are a sturdy little fella.

54:22.718 --> 54:24.050
And loyal.

54:24.219 --> 54:25.551
Very loyal.

54:26.221 --> 54:29.214
In fact, I think
you're the best dog

54:29.391 --> 54:31.474
a Grinch could hope for.

54:31.560 --> 54:32.721
And that is why

54:33.979 --> 54:35.595
I'm promoting you.

54:38.275 --> 54:39.811
Max,

54:39.985 --> 54:43.353
you will guide
my sleigh tonight.

54:49.536 --> 54:50.536
Ha-ha!

54:50.913 --> 54:53.530
I knew you wouldn't
let me down.

54:59.087 --> 55:02.751
<i>It was now Christmas Eve.
There was joy in the air.</i>

55:02.841 --> 55:07.006
<i>For in just a few hours,
Santa Claus would be there.</i>

55:07.095 --> 55:10.930
<i>And the gifts would be left,
and the stockings all filled.</i>

55:11.016 --> 55:15.761
<i>And the anticipation, well,
it started to build.</i>

55:15.938 --> 55:17.645
Ozzy,
what are you doing?

55:17.731 --> 55:21.645
Trying to get myself tired.

55:21.735 --> 55:23.943
All right, eight hours
till Christmas morning.

55:24.029 --> 55:26.567
That's 28,800 seconds.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.865
Okay, and sleep!

55:29.576 --> 55:32.819
Waffle One, this is Waffle Two.
Are you there? Over.

55:32.913 --> 55:34.996
<i>I read you
loud and clear, Waffle Two.</i>

55:35.415 --> 55:36.997
<i>This is Groopert, by the way.</i>

55:37.084 --> 55:38.416
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

55:38.502 --> 55:42.086
<i>Oh. I just wanted
to wish you good luck with Santa Claus.</i>

55:42.172 --> 55:43.788
Thanks. Talk tomorrow.

55:44.883 --> 55:48.172
So, you got any
last-minute wishes for Santa?

55:48.345 --> 55:50.803
Yep. I have
one great big wish.

55:50.889 --> 55:51.970
Good.

55:52.140 --> 55:54.632
Because you deserve
everything you want and more.

55:54.810 --> 55:56.346
Thanks, Mom.

55:56.436 --> 55:58.302
I want the same thing for you.

56:00.482 --> 56:02.849
How did I end up with
such a wonderful daughter?

56:03.026 --> 56:05.188
I don't know.
Sometimes you just get lucky.

56:05.279 --> 56:06.941
Well, then I really did.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.237
Me, too.

56:08.615 --> 56:09.731
I love you, Mom.

56:09.908 --> 56:11.570
I love you, sweetheart.

56:12.953 --> 56:13.989
Good night.

56:14.162 --> 56:15.243
Good night.

56:37.769 --> 56:41.479
<i>The Grinch was
now ready to start his big trip.</i>

56:41.565 --> 56:44.899
<i>He stood like a captain
aboard a great ship.</i>

56:44.985 --> 56:48.399
<i>Yes, the time had now come
to take off like a shot.</i>

56:48.572 --> 56:52.566
Here we go, Max.
Let's see what you've got!

56:58.707 --> 56:59.788
What?

57:00.584 --> 57:01.620
Max?

57:02.377 --> 57:03.913
Max, are you okay?

57:04.421 --> 57:06.128
Huh?

57:13.347 --> 57:15.930
Yeah, Max! Attaboy!

57:16.016 --> 57:17.473
Go, boy! Go!

57:19.561 --> 57:23.976
<i>And down the Grinch
came on his great fateful ride</i>

57:24.149 --> 57:29.144
<i>toward the good homes
of Who-ville and the Christmas inside.</i>

57:37.412 --> 57:41.076
<i>He had planned it and prepped it,
big detail to small.</i>

57:43.794 --> 57:48.209
<i>Yes, he'd get rid of Christmas now,
once and for all.</i>

57:48.840 --> 57:51.708
You take the outside,
I'll take the inside.

57:58.934 --> 58:00.175
House number one.

58:17.035 --> 58:21.029
<i>He was ready to pounce,
and set the score right.</i>

58:21.206 --> 58:24.665
<i>He'd make up for the past,
and he'd do it tonight.</i>

58:24.835 --> 58:25.951
Okay.

58:26.044 --> 58:28.081
Now let's steal Christmas.

58:30.424 --> 58:32.916
<i>He swept up their presents
with the speed of a wiz.</i>

58:33.719 --> 58:39.056
<i>And he knew he'd cause sadness,
only theirs now, not his.</i>

59:16.845 --> 59:18.711
<i>All this excess and nonsense</i>

59:18.889 --> 59:20.130
<i>it was all about greed.</i>

59:20.307 --> 59:22.219
<i>About meaningless stuff</i>

59:22.392 --> 59:24.133
<i>that they didn't even need.</i>

59:25.020 --> 59:26.056
Yeah.

59:33.153 --> 59:36.317
<i>The Grinch went to work.
He scooped up the toys.</i>

59:37.074 --> 59:39.191
<i>He raced against time,</i>

59:39.367 --> 59:41.154
<i>he raced againstjoy.</i>

59:46.625 --> 59:49.709
<i>He hit a few snags as he made
his way through...</i>

59:49.795 --> 59:51.878
<i>...an angry orange cat</i>

59:53.340 --> 59:55.081
<i>and a sleepwalking Who.</i>

59:55.217 --> 59:56.708
Huh?

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:04.515
Thank you, Mommy.

01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:09.304
<i>He stole pop guns
and bicycles, roller skates, drums,</i>

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:12.519
<i>checker boards, tricycles,
popcorn and plums.</i>

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:18.112
<i>Gadgets and gizmos
and dolls with strange names,</i>

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:21.532
<i>goofballs and shloof-balls
and video games.</i>

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:54.812
<i>And he swiped, and he poached.
Yes, the stealing was on.</i>

01:00:54.901 --> 01:01:00.067
<i>And this day that he hated,
well, he made it be gone.</i>

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:08.367
This is it. The last house.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:20.299
<i>Dashing through the snow
in a one-dog open sleigh</i>

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:26.092
<i>One more house to go
and Christmas goes away</i>

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:39.403
Huh?

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.026
Oh, what the heck.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:48.744
Huh?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.372
He's here!

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:53.749
What the...

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.055
How do I get out of this?

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.097
Santa Claus.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.890
Oh. Hello.
A little help, please.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.667
I'll let you down,
just give me a minute.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.650
Oh, that'd be great.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:21.779
I'm coming.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:24.526
Just trying to remember
which cord it is.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.240
Oh, no!

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:29.160
I'm so sorry, are you okay?

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:31.659
Yeah. I guess so.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.410
Let me help you.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.291
Sit down here.

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:39.082
Drink this.

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:41.713
It'll make you feel better.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:45.008
Uh... Thanks.

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:49.881
Wow. I can't believe
it's really you!

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:51.058
Uh...

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.268
Yeah.

01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:55.641
I'm so sorry about the trap and
everything, but I really need...

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.306
Hey! Why are you
taking our Christmas tree?

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:01.527
Well...

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.191
One of the lights
wasn't working,

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.648
so I thought I'd take it back
to the workshop

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:08.403
and see if I could fix it.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:10.780
I didn't know you did that.

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:12.866
Yeah. Sure.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:15.164
Now, why don't you go back
upstairs to bed,

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:17.186
and then when you wake up
the tree will be fixed

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:18.521
and your presents
will be waiting under it.

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:21.003
Wait. You don't understand,
I don't want presents.

01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:24.002
Of course you do.
Everyone wants presents.

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:25.583
No, no, really, I don't!

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:27.589
I want you to help my mom.

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.136
Your mom?

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.056
Yeah. She works so hard

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:35.218
and is always doing stuff
for other people,

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:38.146
and I just want her
to be happy.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:41.149
You want me
to help your mom?

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:42.770
You're Santa.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.810
You make people happy.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:48.815
And everyone
should be happy, right?

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:51.158
Yeah...

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:53.652
I guess they should.

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:57.119
Santa, are you okay?

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.333
What? Uh...

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:02.127
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.419
Now, why don't you
go back up to bed, hmm?

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:06.669
Okay.

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:10.302
I wish you could
celebrate with us tomorrow.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.345
We all get together and sing.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.802
It's so beautiful

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:18.512
that if you close your eyes
and listen,

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:21.848
all of your sadness
just goes away.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:27.524
That sounds nice.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:30.783
Huh?

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.575
Thank you, Santa.

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:39.240
Good night.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.831
Good... Good night.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:05:01.346
I just met the strangest
little Who girl.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:08.398
All right, Max. Let's go.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:16.406
<i>He tried to forget it,
but the words filled his head</i>

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:20.410
<i>and he found himself thinking
about what the young girl had said.</i>

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:24.873
<i>It was hard to imagine.
Could it really be true?</i>

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:29.173
<i>But if they could all be happy,
maybe he could be, too.</i>

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:55.991
What?

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:05.585
<i>Her head felt unsteady,
and her heart was just sick.</i>

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:06.670
Oh, no!

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:10.623
<i>It must be a joke
or a prank, or a trick.</i>

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.505
<i>Who would do such a thing?</i>

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:16.045
<i>Who would stoop down this low?</i>

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:22.010
<i>And then one little girl
realized she might just know.</i>

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:28.141
<i>3,000 feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit,</i>

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:32.904
<i>the Grinch rode with his load
to the tip-top to dump it.</i>

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:34.404
Keep going.

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:36.361
We're gonna make it.

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:40.157
Oh, dear.
What... What happened?

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.487
Where's the decorations?

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:42.581
All the presents.

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.906
Aw, man!

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:47.243
Mom, it's my fault.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.377
What... What is?

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:50.708
All of this.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:53.253
I trapped Santa last night

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:57.337
because I wanted to ask him
to do something special for you.

01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.671
But I think I made him mad

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:02.850
and that's why he stole
everyone's Christmas.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:06.805
No! No, no. No, honey,
this isn't your fault.

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:08.935
He didn't steal Christmas,

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.974
he just stole stuff.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.273
Christmas is in here.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:18.574
And besides, I already have
the greatest gift I could ever get.

01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:22.160
You.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.963
Just one more shove.

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:37.467
What's that? Do you hear it?

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.103
They're singing?

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.063
I don't understand, Max.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.485
Don't they know what I've done?

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:20.754
<i>As he watched the small girl,
he thought he might melt.</i>

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:24.932
<i>If he did what she did,
would he feel what she felt?</i>

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:46.370
<i>And the luscious sound swelled,
reaching up to the skies.</i>

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:51.326
<i>And the Grinch heard
with his heart, and it tripled in size.</i>

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:06.014
What? Oh, no!

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.017
No! No, no, no!

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.187
Oh, no!

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.323
No, don't worry. I got it.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:26.203
Max, it's okay. I'm...

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:32.243
Oh, no, no, no.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:36.745
Max!

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.298
Huh?

01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:06.324
Fred?

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:11.997
You...

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.287
You came back.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:21.044
Max, the gifts! We have to return them.

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:25.925
<i>And having heard the Whos' goodness,
having felt the Whos' song,</i>

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:30.011
<i>he tried to make right
what he had made wrong.</i>

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:01.715
Uh...

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:04.834
Hello, everybody.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:06.762
Uh...

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.143
Uh...

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.102
It was me.

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:18.181
I stole your Christmas.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.726
I stole it because...

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:28.608
Because I thought it would fix
something that happened a long time ago.

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:31.614
But it didn't,

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:33.908
and I'm sorry.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:42.496
I'm so very sorry.

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:45.165
For everything.

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:09.234
Not now, Max.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:11.821
I need to be alone.

01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:39.728
I kind of thought you might like it.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:41.534
You don't like it?
Oh, I could take it back.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:44.047
It's not a big deal.
I just thought maybe you...

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.482
Oh, hey.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:50.030
Merry Christmas
to you, too, Max.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:59.824
That's gonna get old.

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:02.209
What was that?

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:07.841
Huh?

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:11.835
Uh, hello.

01:13:12.013 --> 01:13:13.299
Hi.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.130
Remember me?

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:18.221
Yes. Yes, I do.
I remember you.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.763
My name is Cindy-Lou.
Cindy-Lou Who.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:24.397
It's nice to meet you,
Cindy-Lou.

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:27.480
Oh, my name is Grinch.

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:30.191
And, uh, this is Max.

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:32.523
Whoa!
Nice to meet you, Max.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:37.282
I just came to invite you to our house
for Christmas dinner.

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:39.162
What? Me?

01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:42.074
But I took your gifts.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.367
Yeah, I know.

01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:44.668
And your trees.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:45.754
Yep.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:48.164
I stole your whole Christmas.

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:49.582
I know you did.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.792
But we're inviting you anyway.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:53.760
But why?

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:57.723
Because you've been alone
long enough.

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:01.101
Dinner's at 6:00!

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.306
Don't be late.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:06.148
And make sure you bring your
sweet doggy, too!

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:26.705
Right. Okay.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:28.421
Mmm.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.466
Hmm.

01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:35.298
Um, this is a bad idea.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.554
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.597
They're all gonna hate me.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.056
All right.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:47.180
I did it.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:50.608
Oh, Mr. Grinch.

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:52.812
I'm so happy
you decided to come.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:54.021
Welcome!

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:55.814
Thank you for inviting me.

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:58.237
Uh, I wore a tie.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.193
And it's a very nice tie.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:02.867
Cindy-Lou, look who came!

01:15:02.957 --> 01:15:04.994
Mr. Grinch! You're here!

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.533
Hello!

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:08.577
Come on in,
I'll show you around.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:10.461
Oh. Okay.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:17.677
Hello, Mr. Grinch.
Merry Christmas.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:19.804
Merry Christmas to you, too.

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:23.680
Aunt Ida, I'd like you to meet
my friend, the Grinch.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:26.345
Oh, it's nice to meet you,
Mr. Grinch.

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:29.182
Thank you.
It's nice to be here.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.101
Oh, here,
let me take that for you.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.731
Oh, thank you.

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:36.508
Cindy-Lou, could you make
a little room for this, please?

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:38.114
No, don't worry.
I've got it.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.692
Oh, isn't that thoughtful?

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:50.452
Is that grouchy,
grumpy Grinchy I see standing over there?

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.333
Bricklebaum, good to see you.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:54.836
- Come on, Grinchy, give me a hug.
- Oh!

01:15:54.925 --> 01:15:57.338
It don't count if
you don't hug back, buddy.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:02.510
Okay, come take your seats,
everyone. Dinner's ready.

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:04.424
Come on,
you're sitting next to me.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:09.771
Here you go.

01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:24.619
This is my first Christmas dinner.
What happens?

01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:25.821
You'll see.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:31.121
Would you do the honors,
Mr. Grinch?

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:32.295
Oh.

01:16:32.379 --> 01:16:33.961
Uh, okay.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.338
Do you mind
if I say something first?

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:39.759
Not at all.

01:16:40.971 --> 01:16:44.965
Um, well, everybody,
I just want to say,

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:48.135
I've spent my entire life

01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:51.722
hating Christmas
and everything about it.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:56.772
But now I see that
it wasn't Christmas I hated,

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.487
it was being alone.

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:07.905
But I'm not alone anymore.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:11.036
And I have all of you
to thank for it.

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:14.373
But especially

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:17.415
this little girl right here.

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:18.957
Ma'am,

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:22.795
your daughter's kindness
changed my life.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.174
That's my girl.

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:28.470
Oh, that was beautiful.

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:29.722
That's my best friend.

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.055
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:36.980
Merry Christmas, Cindy-Lou.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:41.689
<i>And the Grinch raised his glass,
and led the Whos in a toast.</i>

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:45.901
To kindness and love,
the things we need most.
