Um... listen.

20:29.588 --> 20:32.250
I really appreciate this call.

20:32.251 --> 20:37.244
And I'll tell you what.
If you're, um... willing to...

20:37.245 --> 20:39.474
kick in that cockpit door...

20:39.475 --> 20:42.137
and save all the people
on the plane...

20:42.138 --> 20:44.534
and make your way back
to me and the kids...

20:44.535 --> 20:47.064
then I'm willing
to give you another chance.

20:47.065 --> 20:50.394
Okay. Bet.

20:50.395 --> 20:54.122
I'll be home soon. You know why?

20:54.123 --> 20:56.286
I'm Passenger 57!

20:56.287 --> 20:59.049
"Always bet on black." Hiyah!

20:59.050 --> 21:00.780
Hi-yah! [woman screams]

21:00.781 --> 21:01.813
Oh, snap. You scared me.

21:01.814 --> 21:03.544
I'm so sorry. Ah!

21:07.107 --> 21:09.536
You know, Stevie,
in my mind right now...

21:09.537 --> 21:11.666
you're a big-booty Brazilian

21:11.667 --> 21:14.929
with twerking skills.

21:14.930 --> 21:17.293
One out of three ain't bad.

21:17.294 --> 21:19.756
Hey, tell me where you feel this.

21:19.757 --> 21:21.520
Girl!
