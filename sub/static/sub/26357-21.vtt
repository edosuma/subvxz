Why can't America do that?

07:29.483 --> 07:30.984

07:31.018 --> 07:33.687
America can't pay for health
care and give corporations

07:33.721 --> 07:36.356
the tax breaks
they so desperately need.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.858
I'm not delirious.

you don't feel safe

07:46.967 --> 07:48.936

roams the streets.

-You're the spleen.

We don't know what it does
and we don't care.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.925
She's in the asylum
pipeline now.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.927
You can't separate us
from our child.

That's America's thing.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.263

(Canadian accent):
Look, I'm fine, eh.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.115

Okay.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.391
Lisa, where should we go
for dinner tonight?

09:18.425 --> 09:20.527
Harvey's or Swiss Chalet?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.095
How about Mr. Submarine?

09:22.129 --> 09:23.864
(gasps)
Or Earls?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.132
Don't forget Humpty's.

Local smarty-pants Lisa Simpson
has been abducted

to the north, Canada.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.953
Here in Springfield,
reactions to Lisa's loss

09:45.986 --> 09:48.756
have been loud and uninformed.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.624
Lisa was the moral center
of this town.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.626
Now it's Barney,
who knows nothing.

09:52.660 --> 09:56.129
Except it is the purpose of
government to see that not only

09:56.163 --> 09:58.799
the legitimate interests
of the few are protected,

09:58.832 --> 10:01.501
but that the rights of the many
are conserved.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.772
-Shut your gibber-hole. (grunts)
-Ow!

10:04.805 --> 10:08.241
Ugh! She was the only one in
this band worth a tinker's damn.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.811

-Oh, come on.

Hello.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.666
As an American,
I'd like to apologize

10:32.700 --> 10:34.301
for something
our president said about

10:34.334 --> 10:36.970
your wonderfully progressive
prime minister.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.606
Is there any way I can send
a note? Or maybe I could...

10:39.639 --> 10:41.775
-Right this way.
-Oh.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.844
Hmm!

I am really, really sorry about
what our president called you.

10:51.518 --> 10:55.188
I don't think about it,
I've moved on.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.357
Weak. He called me weak.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.026
Absolutely.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.360
Let me ask you.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.796
Does this look weak?

11:02.830 --> 11:04.197

11:04.231 --> 11:06.967
Wow, that is impressive.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.902
Uh, watch your tie.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.504
So, listen, if I could just
ask you one question

11:24.384 --> 11:25.753
MRS. SCARBOROUGH:
Now, Lisa,

11:25.786 --> 11:29.089
we'll be doing a class play
based on a great Canadian novel.

Kravitz by Mordecai Richler?
