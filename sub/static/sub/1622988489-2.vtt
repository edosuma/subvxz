00:05.625 --> 00:07.917
HUNTER B-15: On behalf
of the Time Variance Authority,

00:08.000 --> 00:11.042
I hereby arrest you
for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

00:15.083 --> 00:18.875
MISS MINUTES: Long ago, the all-knowing
Time-Keepers emerged,

00:18.958 --> 00:22.708
creating and organizing
the Sacred Timeline.

00:22.792 --> 00:25.750
Sometimes, people like you
veer off the path.

00:25.833 --> 00:28.500
We call those Variants.

00:32.958 --> 00:35.000
Laufeyson, how do you plead?

00:35.875 --> 00:38.667
-I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.
-How long have you been here?

00:38.750 --> 00:42.417
MOBIUS: I don't know. It's hard to say,
time passes differently here in the TVA.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.125
Now, you parade about

00:44.208 --> 00:47.667
as if you're the divine arbiters
of power in the universe.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.208
LOKI: Infinity Stones?

00:49.292 --> 00:51.000
Some of the guys
use 'em as paperweights.

00:51.083 --> 00:53.042
Is this the greatest power
in the universe?

00:55.542 --> 00:58.583
LOKI: I can't go back, can I?
MOBIUS: I can't offer you salvation,

00:59.458 --> 01:01.458
but maybe I can offer
you something better.

01:01.542 --> 01:04.333
A fugitive Variant's been killing
our Minutemen.

01:04.417 --> 01:07.417
And you need the God of Mischief
to help you stop him?

01:09.125 --> 01:10.167
Why me?

01:10.250 --> 01:12.417
MOBIUS: The Variant we're hunting is...

01:12.500 --> 01:13.542
You.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.958
CHILD: Make a wish.

02:27.667 --> 02:29.625
Hi! What's going on?

02:29.708 --> 02:31.042
You guys aren't dressed right.

02:31.125 --> 02:32.833
I... So...

02:34.458 --> 02:36.250
MINUTEMAN: Variant detected, Commander.

02:38.417 --> 02:39.750
Let's move.

02:41.625 --> 02:44.167
Some of us need this, you know.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.667
MINUTEMAN: No nexus energy yet, ma'am.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.875
HUNTER C-20: It's a trap.
Watch your backs!

03:04.958 --> 03:08.167
ANNOUNCER: My lords, my ladies, welcome

03:08.250 --> 03:11.542
and thank you for joining us,
here at the castle.

03:11.625 --> 03:16.500
Please, settle into your seats
for a great battle is about to commence.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.667
The prize? Our princess.

03:18.750 --> 03:23.375
Will evil prevail,
or are we holding out for a hero?

03:39.083 --> 03:40.417
MINUTEMAN: Commander?

03:50.167 --> 03:55.292
Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the Gods?

03:55.792 --> 03:58.708
Where's the streetwise
Hercules to fight...

03:58.792 --> 04:00.083
What are you doing?

04:00.167 --> 04:01.583
Having some fun.

04:03.208 --> 04:08.125
Isn't there a white knight
Upon a fiery steed?

04:09.292 --> 04:14.792
Late at night, I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need

04:14.875 --> 04:17.083
I need a hero

04:17.167 --> 04:20.583
I'm holding out for a hero
Till the end of the night

04:21.750 --> 04:24.125
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast

04:24.208 --> 04:27.417
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

04:27.500 --> 04:29.250
I need a hero

04:29.958 --> 04:34.042
I'm holding out for a hero
'Till the morning light

04:34.125 --> 04:37.125
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon

04:37.208 --> 04:40.417
And he's gotta be larger than life

04:42.000 --> 04:43.833
I need a hero!

05:07.583 --> 05:10.542
MISS MINUTES: Okay, y'all,
let's review what we've learned.

05:10.625 --> 05:13.667
What happens when a nexus event
branches past red line?

05:14.708 --> 05:16.250
Very bad things.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.667
Come on, Loki. What is it?

05:18.792 --> 05:23.208
It's when the TVA can
no longer reset a nexus event.

05:23.292 --> 05:25.208
Okay? Boring.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.500
Right. And that would lead
to the destruction of the timeline

05:28.583 --> 05:31.208
and the collapse of reality as we know it.

05:31.292 --> 05:32.292
Can you hear me?

05:32.917 --> 05:34.708
Are you a recording? Or are you alive?

05:34.792 --> 05:37.000
Uh, sorta both.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.083
Ah.

05:39.667 --> 05:42.333
Watch it! Where's your manners?

05:42.958 --> 05:44.875
Oh! Hey! Quit it!

05:45.875 --> 05:48.167
That is not nice. Jerk.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.125
-You can't hide...
-MOBIUS: Training goin' well?

05:50.208 --> 05:51.708
-Yeah.
-Is that my jet ski magazine?

05:51.792 --> 05:52.917
Put it down. Gear up.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.542
There's been an attack. Let's go.

05:57.667 --> 05:58.792
Put it on.

06:05.167 --> 06:08.083
Good. Yeah. Smart.

06:10.708 --> 06:12.292
C-20 and her team went dark

06:12.375 --> 06:15.292
shortly after they jumped
into the 1985 branch.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.292
All signs point to another ambush.

06:17.375 --> 06:21.542
We've grabbed enough temporal aura
to know it's our Loki Variant.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.875
But which kind of Loki, remains unknown.

06:23.958 --> 06:26.000
They're the lesser kind, to be clear.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.000
Let me see
the back of that jacket.

06:33.667 --> 06:34.667
Hmm.

06:37.917 --> 06:40.042
Very subtle. Well done.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.792
I don't want anybody out there
to forget what you are.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.542
Oh, your only hope
of capturing a murderer?

06:44.625 --> 06:46.375
No. A cosmic mistake.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.125
-That's enough.
-Lovely.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.208
MOBIUS: Here's the deal.

06:49.292 --> 06:50.625
When we get out on the branch,

06:50.708 --> 06:53.583
we're not just
looking for a Time Criminal.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.000
We're looking for a Loki.

06:55.083 --> 06:57.500
A variation of this guy.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.917
A type we should
all be very familiar with,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
because the TVA
has pruned a lotta these guys,

07:03.083 --> 07:05.083
almost more than any other Variant.

07:05.167 --> 07:06.667
And no two are alike.

07:06.750 --> 07:10.125
Slight differences in appearances,
or not so slight.

07:10.208 --> 07:12.708
Different powers, although,
powers, generally include

07:12.792 --> 07:15.833
shape-shifting,
illusion-projection, and my favorite...

07:15.917 --> 07:17.833
Duplication-casting.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.542
Illusion-projection.

07:21.625 --> 07:23.542
No, they're two
completely different powers.

07:23.625 --> 07:24.708
How?

07:24.792 --> 07:28.375
Illusion-projection involves depicting
a detailed image from outside oneself,

07:28.458 --> 07:30.375
which is perceptible
in the external world,

07:30.458 --> 07:32.708
whereas duplication-casting
entails recreating

07:32.792 --> 07:36.250
an exact facsimile of one's own body
in its present circumstance,

07:36.333 --> 07:39.833
which acts as a true holographic mirror
of its molecular structure.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.667
But you already knew that.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.625
Okay, take a breath. Noted.

07:47.292 --> 07:51.208
We're gonna break into two teams,
including myself and Professor Loki.

07:51.292 --> 07:52.333
Why?

07:53.458 --> 07:57.167
Because whoever this Variant is,
we haven't been able to find him.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.000
So let's bring in an expert.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.375
That's me.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.375
-Do I get a weapon?
-Nah.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.208
Well, I'll have my magic back.
Is no one concerned about that?

08:08.292 --> 08:10.167
-Of what?
-Me betraying you.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.458
-No.
-Why not?

08:11.542 --> 08:12.875
You know that we can catch you.

08:12.958 --> 08:16.167
And how's betraying us gonna get you
any closer to the Time-Keepers?

08:17.208 --> 08:19.792
An audience
with the Time-Keepers is on the table?

08:19.875 --> 08:21.208
Keep that focus.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.000
Apex of nexus signature located, ma'am.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.250
Let me ask you this,

08:33.333 --> 08:35.708
why don't we just travel
back to before the attack,

08:35.792 --> 08:37.333
when the Variant first arrives?

08:37.417 --> 08:40.292
Nexus events destabilize the time flow.

08:40.375 --> 08:44.625
This branch is still changing and growing,
so you gotta show up in real time.

08:44.708 --> 08:48.083
Did you watch any of the training videos
you were supposed to?

08:48.167 --> 08:49.958
Well, as many as I could stand.

08:50.042 --> 08:52.000
Your TVA propaganda is exhausting.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.292
And what do these do?

08:54.333 --> 08:58.625
Reset charges prune the affected
radius of a branched timeline,

08:58.708 --> 09:01.500
allowing time to heal all its wounds.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.792
Which sounds like a nice way

09:02.875 --> 09:05.292
of saying disintegrate
everything in its vicinity.

09:05.375 --> 09:06.833
He's on it.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.375
I watched the videos.

09:08.458 --> 09:09.625
I mean, some of them.

09:11.042 --> 09:12.792
HUNTER B-15: So he's taking hostages now?

09:12.875 --> 09:15.167
MOBIUS: The Variant's never
taken a hostage before.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.542
HUNTER B-15: Maybe he's upping his game.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.000
MINUTEMAN: Or he pruned her.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.333
HUNTER B-15: A Loki couldn't
have gotten the jump on C-20.

09:21.417 --> 09:23.000
I think you underestimate, actually...

09:23.083 --> 09:24.750
Fan out and search for her.

09:24.833 --> 09:25.833
And hurry up,

09:25.917 --> 09:27.417
we're at three units until red line.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.375
MINUTEMAN: Let's go. She's right.
MOBIUS: Come on.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.250
Wait...

09:36.750 --> 09:39.125
If you leave this tent,
you'll end up like them.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.125
What do you see?

09:46.375 --> 09:47.625
I see a scheme,

09:49.042 --> 09:51.167
and in that scheme, I see myself.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.667
We have a saying in Asgard,

09:59.167 --> 10:02.542
"Where there are wolf's ears,
wolf's teeth are near."

10:03.167 --> 10:05.167
It means to be aware of your surroundings.

10:05.833 --> 10:09.125
Which is absurd, because my people are,
by nature, gullible fools.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.833
A trait that I, the God of Mischief,

10:10.917 --> 10:13.625
exploited time and time again
simply by listening.

10:13.708 --> 10:17.167
My teeth were sharp,
but my ears even sharper.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.458
We're running out of time, Mobius.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.042
Hold it. Just give him a chance.

10:21.125 --> 10:23.042
LOKI: You remind me of them.

10:23.125 --> 10:27.583
The Time Variance Authority
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.042
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.500
Those you underestimate will devour you.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.000
You underestimate me,

10:34.083 --> 10:37.042
just as you
underestimate this lesser Loki.

10:37.125 --> 10:40.083
Which is why, you walk into
one wolf's mouth after another.

10:40.167 --> 10:42.917
-Two units. He is wasting our time.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.917
Okay. Come on, Loki,
make a long story short.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.417
HUNTER B-15: We need to look for C-20.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.333
That's exactly what
the Variant wants you to do.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.917
It's a trap.
He's waiting for you outside this tent.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.458
Should I secure the reset charges?

10:54.542 --> 10:56.667
No. He wants me. I'm the key to his plan.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.958
-He knows that I'm stronger.
-Almost one unit.

10:59.042 --> 11:02.292
And he rightly believes that together
we can overthrow and rule the TVA.

11:02.375 --> 11:05.167
But that's not what I want.
I have a new purpose.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.792
I'm a servant of the Sacred Timeline.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.792
And knowing
what I now know about his tactics,

11:10.875 --> 11:13.083
I can deliver you the Variant,

11:15.750 --> 11:17.542
but I need assurances.

11:18.250 --> 11:19.625
Yeah?

11:19.708 --> 11:22.042
Assurances that I won't be
completely disintegrated

11:22.125 --> 11:24.083
the moment the job has been done.

11:24.167 --> 11:25.375
Right...

11:26.375 --> 11:28.583
We'll need to speak
to the Time-Keepers at once.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.125
They're in graver danger than we realized.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.583
He's lying. Just playing games.

11:38.667 --> 11:39.917
There's no one out there.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.333
HUNTER B-15: Reset the timeline.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.250
You had me for a second.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.792
My ears are sharp too.

12:37.833 --> 12:41.167
MOBIUS: Is it just me, or does this office
keep getting better and better?

12:42.667 --> 12:44.917
Where'd you get that one, the snow globe?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.042
I love those.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.333
I don't remember bringing back that case.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.708
You're not the only analyst
working for me.

12:51.833 --> 12:54.333
But, would you say,
maybe, I'm your favorite one?

12:55.292 --> 12:58.333
And why do you get to keep all
the trophies from my cases in here?

12:58.417 --> 13:00.625
You don't think I'd love
having that roller skate

13:00.708 --> 13:02.417
there sprucing up my cubicle?

13:02.500 --> 13:04.375
Because I approve the missions.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.208
Good point.

13:06.292 --> 13:09.625
Speaking of which,
let's talk about the one you just botched.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.708
You might need this for our discussion.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.250
I hope it's a double.

13:14.333 --> 13:21.292
This Variant is...
"Insubordinate, stubborn, unpredictable."

13:21.375 --> 13:23.125
Sounds like someone else I know.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.750
I was just thinking
it sounds like someone I know.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.042
-Mobius?
-What?

13:30.708 --> 13:32.542
Those rings were already there.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.333
And they're all from you.

13:34.417 --> 13:37.417
Maybe it's from
your other favorite analyst.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.458
Listen, Ravonna, I'm sorry.

13:40.542 --> 13:42.958
I realize that my, you know,

13:43.042 --> 13:45.583
methods with this Loki
are controversial, but...

13:45.667 --> 13:48.958
Towing a dangerous Variant
into the field is controversial.

13:49.042 --> 13:51.583
Yeah, it didn't go exactly
the way I wanted it to today,

13:51.667 --> 13:53.292
but here's what we did find out.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.208
The Variant likes to stall for time,

13:55.292 --> 13:58.083
and, eventually, we'll catch
the other one doing the same thing.

13:58.167 --> 14:00.708
Because understanding
this Loki helps me get closer

14:00.792 --> 14:02.625
to the one we're chasing. Right?

14:03.417 --> 14:06.583
Look, I know you have
a soft spot for broken things.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.208
-I don't think so.
-Yes, you do.

14:08.292 --> 14:11.250
But Loki is an evil, lying scourge.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.792
That is the part he plays
on the Sacred Timeline.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.417
Maybe he wants to mix it up.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.625
Sometimes you get tired
of playing the same part.

14:17.708 --> 14:19.833
Is that possible? He can change?

14:19.917 --> 14:21.917
Not unless the Time-Keepers decree it.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.000
And then, it shall be so.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.875
-And how are the old Time-Keepers?
-

14:28.750 --> 14:30.000
How do you think?

14:30.083 --> 14:32.250
I don't know.
'Cause I've never met 'em.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.208
Thankfully. Although,
I shouldn't say that.

14:34.292 --> 14:35.333
That one looks...

14:35.417 --> 14:38.167
The Time-Keepers are monitoring
every aspect of this case.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.167
I've never seen them so involved.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.375
They want that Variant caught.

14:42.458 --> 14:43.958
So do I.

14:44.042 --> 14:46.875
And this is the last chance
you're gonna get with this Loki.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.792
Thank you, R Slayer.

15:01.292 --> 15:02.417
I don't remember this.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.500
This must be from that analyst
you keep on the side.

15:06.292 --> 15:07.750
Stay focused.

15:07.833 --> 15:09.333
Eyes on the road.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.083
RAVONNA: Mobius?

15:12.167 --> 15:13.417
I was almost gone.

15:14.042 --> 15:15.750
You really believe in this Variant?

15:16.333 --> 15:20.167
Mmm... Luckily, he believes in himself
enough for the both of us.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.000
And, hey, if it doesn't work,
I'll delete him myself.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.458
He's really arrogant.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.875
You're probably wondering
what happened out on the mission.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.458
That was your first lesson
in catching a Loki.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.500
Expect the expected.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.125
Half the fun of being a trickster

15:40.208 --> 15:42.708
is knowing everyone knows
you're a trickster, and then,

15:42.792 --> 15:44.667
many of your tricks
can come from exploiting

15:44.750 --> 15:47.750
-the fact that you know that they know...
-Okay. Just shut up!

15:47.833 --> 15:50.417
Please. What happened
to the guy I met on the elevator?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.167
Who didn't like to talk. Remember him?

15:52.250 --> 15:53.458
Now I'm stuck with this guy

15:53.542 --> 15:56.083
who won't stop yacking away
about what makes a Loki tick!

15:56.167 --> 15:58.375
What? Isn't that precisely why I'm here?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.042
No. I don't care what makes you tick.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.833
You're here to help me catch
the superior version of yourself.

16:04.917 --> 16:05.917
-That's it!
-Hang on.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.500
I'm not sure "superior"
is actually quite the right word.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.292
See? There it is. Right there.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.875
I believed, stupidly,

16:11.958 --> 16:15.667
that insecure need for validation
would motivate you to find the killer.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.542
Not 'cause you care about
the TVA mission or bein' a hero,

16:18.625 --> 16:24.083
but because you know this Variant
is better than you and you can't take it.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.792
Very nice.

16:28.875 --> 16:34.792
I mean, it is adorable that you think
you could possibly manipulate me.

16:35.708 --> 16:37.417
I'm ten steps ahead of you.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.833
I've been playing a game
of my own all along.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.750
What, charm your way
in front of the Time-Keepers,

16:43.833 --> 16:46.417
hustle them, and seize control of the TVA?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.083
Am I getting warm?

16:48.167 --> 16:51.542
A double cross
by history's most reliable liar.

16:51.625 --> 16:54.583
Okay. Why are you in there
sticking your neck out for me?

16:54.667 --> 16:55.792
I'll give you two options,

16:55.875 --> 16:57.750
and you can believe
whichever one you want.

16:57.833 --> 17:01.625
A, because I see a scared
little boy, shivering in the cold.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.000
And you kinda feel bad for that ice runt.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.708
Or B, I just wanna catch this guy,

17:06.792 --> 17:09.042
and I'll tell you whatever
I need to tell you.

17:13.792 --> 17:15.208
I don't need your sympathy.

17:15.292 --> 17:17.167
Good, 'cause I'm runnin' out of it.

17:19.958 --> 17:21.958
What's this?
Next step of your manipulation...

17:22.042 --> 17:24.083
This is the final step.
Your last chance.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.958
Oh, and what does my desperate
last chance require?

17:27.042 --> 17:28.167
Work.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.375
Work?

17:52.333 --> 17:55.500
I need you to go over each
and every one of the Variant's case files,

17:55.583 --> 17:57.375
and then, give me your... How do I put it?

17:57.458 --> 17:59.708
Your unique Loki perspective.

17:59.792 --> 18:02.167
And who knows?
Maybe there's something that we missed.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.792
Well, you're idiots.
I suspect you probably missed a lot.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.500
That's why I'm lucky
I got ya for a little bit longer.

18:07.583 --> 18:08.958
Let me park ya at this desk.

18:09.042 --> 18:11.500
And don't be afraid
to really lean into this work.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.000
Here's a good trick for you.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.792
Pretend your life depends on it.

18:14.875 --> 18:16.083
I'm gonna get a snack.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.708
Oh, my goodness.

18:32.792 --> 18:36.375
Don't tell me the Variant ambushed
and killed another team of Minutemen.

18:37.208 --> 18:40.208
And stole
their reset charge as well.

18:43.833 --> 18:44.833
Shh.

18:54.458 --> 18:55.458
Shh.

19:06.458 --> 19:08.000
Hi.

19:11.833 --> 19:13.000
Hello?

19:23.083 --> 19:24.125
Can I help you?

19:24.208 --> 19:26.708
Yes. I'm on some important TVA business.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.875
Follow-up to a field mission.
You know how it goes.

19:29.958 --> 19:33.208
We red lined near the apex, and...

19:37.917 --> 19:42.583
Um, I'd like all files pertaining
to the creation of the TVA, please.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.500
Those are classified.

19:47.167 --> 19:50.792
Okay. I'd like all files pertaining
to the beginning of time then.

19:50.875 --> 19:52.833
-Those are classified.
-Okay, the end of time.

19:52.917 --> 19:55.208
-Those are classified.
-Okay, what files can I have?

20:02.542 --> 20:03.875
Happy reading.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.708
I found something.

21:21.792 --> 21:24.583
No, I said, "Don't bother me
until you've read all the files."

21:24.667 --> 21:25.792
-I have.
-Every file?

21:25.875 --> 21:27.250
-Yes.
-Pertaining to the Variant?

21:27.333 --> 21:29.750
The answer isn't in the files,
it's on the timeline.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.333
He's hiding in apocalypses.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.458
Which apocalypse?

21:36.542 --> 21:38.958
Any time in history?
There's, like, a million of 'em.

21:40.083 --> 21:42.083
Ragnarok. Are you familiar?

21:42.167 --> 21:46.083
Yes. The destruction of Asgard
and most of its people. I'm sorry.

21:46.167 --> 21:47.750
Yes, very sad.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.167
Anyway, it got me thinking...

21:50.500 --> 21:51.500
Go ahead.

21:52.708 --> 21:54.458
Nexus events

21:54.542 --> 21:58.833
happen when someone does something
they're not supposed to do, right?

21:58.917 --> 22:01.458
Well, it's a little more
complicated, but, yeah.

22:01.542 --> 22:04.375
Great. And then that thing
they're not supposed to do,

22:04.458 --> 22:08.000
cascades into a whole range of other
things that aren't supposed to happen.

22:08.083 --> 22:11.792
And so on and so forth, until eventually,
a new timeline branches. Yes?

22:11.875 --> 22:14.458
Chaotic alterations
of a predetermined outcome.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.625
-Exactly. So, let's just say...
-Mmm-hmm. What are you doing?

22:17.708 --> 22:19.917
...your salad is Asgard in this scenario.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.542
-It's not Asgard, that's my lunch.
-It's a metaphor.

22:22.625 --> 22:24.250
-Just hang in there.
-I want that salad.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.125
And I could go down to Asgard

22:27.208 --> 22:30.042
before Ragnarok
causes its complete destruction

22:30.125 --> 22:31.792
and I could do anything I wanted.

22:31.875 --> 22:37.625
I could, let's say,
push the Hulk off the Rainbow Bridge.

22:38.542 --> 22:40.833
-There he goes.
-The salt's Hulk?

22:40.917 --> 22:44.625
And I could also...
Set fire to the palace.

22:44.708 --> 22:47.917
No, just stop.
Don't set fire to the palace.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.167
Okay? I can do whatever I want to do,
and it would never matter.

22:52.250 --> 22:55.625
It wouldn't go against the dictates
of the timeline because...

23:00.417 --> 23:01.833
-Excuse me?
-MOBIUS: Oh, God!

23:02.917 --> 23:04.042
-You!
-Nice to see you.

23:04.125 --> 23:06.167
I just need this for a second. Thanks.

23:06.250 --> 23:09.500
Because the apocalypse is coming.

23:09.583 --> 23:13.667
Ragnarok, Surtur will destroy
Asgard no matter what I do.

23:16.292 --> 23:19.250
LOKI: There's the apocalypse.
MOBIUS: That's the apocalypse?

23:19.333 --> 23:22.083
Ragnarok obliterates the salt.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.250
Ragnarok.

23:28.958 --> 23:30.208
There it is.

23:30.292 --> 23:31.542
What am I lookin' at?

23:31.625 --> 23:34.500
Okay, it was a clumsy metaphor.
But you see what I mean.

23:34.583 --> 23:37.500
It doesn't matter.
It could be any apocalypse.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.917
It could be a tidal wave.
It could be a meteor.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.167
It could be a volcano, a supernova.

23:42.250 --> 23:47.167
If everything and everyone around you
is destined for imminent destruction,

23:47.250 --> 23:51.208
then nothing that I say or do will matter,

23:52.042 --> 23:54.417
because the timeline's not gonna branch.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.875
'Cause it gets destroyed.

23:56.958 --> 24:01.167
Hence, the Variant could be
hiding in the apocalypse

24:01.250 --> 24:04.000
and do whatever he wants,
and we wouldn't know!

24:06.042 --> 24:07.042
Not bad.

24:07.125 --> 24:09.917
Take me to a real apocalypse,
to Ragnarok, I'll show you.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.125
Yeah. So you can run away
back to your homeland? No.

24:13.208 --> 24:15.083
No, I'm not going home.
We can go anywhere.

24:15.167 --> 24:19.125
I'm not taking you for a stroll along
the promenade, much less an apocalypse.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.750
Oh, Mobius, come on!

24:20.833 --> 24:22.167
What could possibly go wrong?

24:22.250 --> 24:23.875
We gotta properly test this theory.

24:23.958 --> 24:25.417
Well, here's a fun theory.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.125
You lure me out into the field,
and stab me in the back.

24:28.208 --> 24:30.125
And that's a theory I don't wanna test.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.958
I'd never stab anyone in the back.

24:32.042 --> 24:33.875
That's such a boring form of betrayal.

24:33.958 --> 24:37.000
Loki, I've studied almost
every moment of your entire life.

24:37.083 --> 24:40.167
You've literally stabbed
people in the back, like, 50 times.

24:41.750 --> 24:44.292
Well, I'd never do it again,
because it got old.

24:44.375 --> 24:46.417
Okay.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.167
Okay, look, you don't trust me,
you can trust one thing.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.292
I love to be right.

25:12.667 --> 25:15.250
Here we go.
-Shh, any minute now.

25:15.333 --> 25:18.125
Until this entire town
is wiped off the face of this planet.

25:18.208 --> 25:20.792
Imagine. All that volcanic ash...

25:20.875 --> 25:22.625
I know. We don't want to get too giddy.

25:22.708 --> 25:24.167
Oh, come on! It's cool.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.833
No, it is cool, but it's just
not in good taste because...

25:26.917 --> 25:28.458
They're all gonna die anyway.

25:28.542 --> 25:32.333
I know. Now listen, I'm gonna watch
the TemPad for any variance energy.

25:32.417 --> 25:34.542
-Okay.
-Okay, because we gotta be careful.

25:34.625 --> 25:36.875
If you're wrong,
and there's a good chance you are,

25:36.958 --> 25:39.375
anything we do can create a huge branch.

25:39.458 --> 25:42.375
Oh, Mobius! You make even
the end of the world sound boring.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.750
Listen! Okay, we're not meant to be here.

25:44.833 --> 25:46.458
-Okay?
-Okay.

25:46.542 --> 25:48.667
Anything we do can impact
the course of history.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.125
-Do you get that?
-Yes. Yes.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.500
So we're gonna start
with very small disturbances.

25:52.583 --> 25:54.500
-Very small.
-Can you make bird noises?

25:55.583 --> 25:56.667
Bird noises?

25:56.750 --> 25:59.417
Yeah. Bird noises.
Like some, like, whooshing noises.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.208
-Oh.

26:01.292 --> 26:03.333
Loki! Loki!

26:04.167 --> 26:09.292
-Go!

26:09.375 --> 26:12.375
Be free, my horned-friends, be free!

26:42.417 --> 26:43.958
We are
from the future, right?

26:44.042 --> 26:46.125
What is the TVA?
I mean, it's from the future.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.583
It sounds from the future.
It's pretty future-y.

26:48.667 --> 26:50.542
-

26:53.042 --> 26:55.458
Enjoy your last meal while you can!

26:55.542 --> 26:57.625
Nothing matters!

26:57.708 --> 26:59.792
Nothing has any consequence!

26:59.875 --> 27:02.167
Dance while you still can!

27:02.250 --> 27:03.833
-Whoo-hoo!
-

27:05.500 --> 27:06.583
How'd we do?

27:06.667 --> 27:09.792
I don't believe it. Zero variance energy.

27:09.875 --> 27:11.500
No branching in the timeline.

27:11.583 --> 27:14.750
The TVA would never
even know we were here.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.250
If it were me, this is where I would hide.

27:22.458 --> 27:24.708
Doomsdays. The Variant's been
ambushing our soldiers

27:24.792 --> 27:26.792
and hiding out in doomsdays
to cover his tracks.

27:26.875 --> 27:27.875
-You're welcome.
-Yeah.

27:27.958 --> 27:29.958
For this theory to hold,
the disasters have to be

27:30.042 --> 27:32.958
naturally-occurring,
sudden, no warning, no survivors.

27:33.042 --> 27:35.042
-How many could there be?
-I don't know.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.125
We're gonna find out.

27:43.292 --> 27:44.333
Hey?

27:45.375 --> 27:47.167
Come on, let's take a walk.

27:54.167 --> 27:58.542
By the way, at your desk, that magazine?

27:58.625 --> 28:00.958
Yeah. The one on jet skis?

28:01.042 --> 28:02.333
Yes.

28:02.417 --> 28:03.792
Why do you have that?

28:04.875 --> 28:06.292
Because they're awesome.

28:06.375 --> 28:09.167
I suppose they are.
-Yeah.

28:09.250 --> 28:12.667
You know, some things... Actually,
most things in history are kinda dumb,

28:12.750 --> 28:15.417
and everything gets ruined eventually.

28:15.500 --> 28:20.250
But in the early 1990s,
for a brief, shining moment,

28:20.333 --> 28:24.417
there was a beautiful union
of form and function,

28:24.500 --> 28:26.250
which we call the jet ski,

28:26.333 --> 28:28.625
and a reasonable man cannot differ.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.625
You ever been on one?

28:31.708 --> 28:34.208
No... No.

28:35.125 --> 28:39.000
I think a TVA agent showing up
on a jet ski on the Sacred Timeline,

28:39.083 --> 28:41.042
that would create a branch for sure.

28:41.125 --> 28:42.292
It'd be fun, though.

28:42.375 --> 28:44.875
Yeah, it'd be really fun.

28:46.250 --> 28:47.583
So, why read about them?

28:49.375 --> 28:53.000
Just helps remind me
of what we're fighting for.

28:55.583 --> 28:58.792
I mean, you really believe
in all this stuff, don't you?

28:58.875 --> 29:02.000
I don't get hung up on,
"Believe, not believe."

29:02.083 --> 29:04.208
I just accept what is.

29:04.292 --> 29:07.250
-Three magic lizards...
-Time-Keepers.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.542
-...created the TVA, and everyone in it...
-Right.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.750
-...including you?
-Including me.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.875
Every time I start
to admire your intelligence,

29:13.958 --> 29:16.583
-you say something like that.
-Okay, who created you, Loki?

29:17.458 --> 29:18.958
A Frost Giant of Jotunheim.

29:19.042 --> 29:20.375
And who raised you?

29:20.458 --> 29:21.667
Odin of Asgard.

29:21.750 --> 29:24.000
Odin, God of the Heavens.

29:24.083 --> 29:27.375
Asgard, mystical realm, beyond the stars.

29:27.458 --> 29:29.958
-Frost Giants. Listen to yourself...
-It's not the same.

29:30.042 --> 29:31.333
-It's completely different.
-No.

29:31.417 --> 29:33.833
-It's not the same.
-It's exactly the same thing.

29:33.917 --> 29:36.625
Because if you think too hard
about where any of us came from,

29:36.708 --> 29:39.375
who we truly are,
it sounds kinda ridiculous.

29:39.458 --> 29:41.292
Existence is chaos.

29:41.375 --> 29:44.458
Nothing makes any sense,
so we try to make some sense of it.

29:44.542 --> 29:48.833
And I'm just lucky that the chaos
I emerged into gave me all this...

29:49.625 --> 29:52.542
-My own glorious purpose.
-

29:52.625 --> 29:54.500
'Cause the TVA is my life.

29:54.583 --> 29:56.708
And it's real because I believe it's real.

29:59.833 --> 30:02.333
Fair enough. You believe it's real.

30:02.417 --> 30:03.792
Yeah.

30:03.875 --> 30:05.583
So everything is written.

30:05.667 --> 30:07.833
Past, present, future.

30:07.917 --> 30:09.708
There's no such thing as free will.

30:09.792 --> 30:13.250
Well, I mean, you know,
it's an oversimplification...

30:13.333 --> 30:14.833
So, in fact, in a way,

30:15.792 --> 30:21.208
you and I here at the TVA,
we're the only ones who are actually free.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.667
Where are you going with this, Loki?

30:25.875 --> 30:27.208
How does it all end?

30:27.292 --> 30:28.875
That's a work in progress.

30:28.958 --> 30:31.917
Oh, those lazy Time-Keepers.
What are they waiting for?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.208
Au contraire.

30:33.292 --> 30:36.750
No. Because while we protect
what came before,

30:36.833 --> 30:39.417
they're toiling away in their chamber,

30:39.500 --> 30:43.792
untangling the epilogue
from its infinite branches.

30:43.875 --> 30:47.167
Ah, I see. So, when they're finished,
what happens then?

30:47.250 --> 30:48.583
So are we.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.292
No more nexus events.

30:50.375 --> 30:51.417
Just order.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.125
And we meet in peace at the end of time.

30:55.292 --> 30:56.708
Nice, right?

30:58.958 --> 31:00.250
-Only order?
-Mmm-hmm.

31:00.333 --> 31:03.000
No chaos? It sounds boring.

31:03.083 --> 31:04.792
I'm sure it does to you.

31:04.875 --> 31:06.667
You called me a scared little boy.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.208
I called you a lotta things.

31:08.292 --> 31:09.458
You did.

31:10.542 --> 31:11.708
You're wrong, though.

31:13.375 --> 31:15.250
You see, I know something children don't.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.625
What's that?

31:17.333 --> 31:19.583
That no one bad is ever truly bad.

31:21.042 --> 31:23.167
And no one good is ever truly good.

31:26.542 --> 31:27.833
Scared little boy.

31:28.708 --> 31:31.958
Yes, it was quite patronizing.
I thought it was a bit too far, actually.

31:36.458 --> 31:37.792
You're very clever.

31:40.167 --> 31:41.167
I know.

31:43.583 --> 31:46.833
The Variant left something
behind at an old crime scene.

31:46.917 --> 31:48.875
A cathedral. A candy box.

31:48.958 --> 31:50.250
An obvious anachronism.

31:50.333 --> 31:53.000
I gave it to Analysis,
but they couldn't find anything real.

31:53.083 --> 31:55.667
-Why does that matter?
-'Cause now we have two variables.

31:55.750 --> 31:57.833
Apocalyptic natural disasters and...

32:01.083 --> 32:03.292
-Kablooie.
-LOKI: What's that?

32:03.375 --> 32:05.792
Candy. Do you have candy on Asgard?

32:05.875 --> 32:07.292
Yeah. Grapes, nuts.

32:07.958 --> 32:09.750
No wonder you're so bitter.

32:10.417 --> 32:14.833
Okay. Kablooie was only sold
regionally on Earth from 2047 to 2051.

32:14.917 --> 32:18.000
We need to cross-reference
that with every apocalyptic event.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.167
I'm gonna give you half.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.833
Have a competition, see who finds it.

32:20.917 --> 32:22.417
-Sure.
-You wanna bet something?

32:22.500 --> 32:23.875
-Yeah.
-Gentleman's bet.

32:23.958 --> 32:26.958
Yeah, let's play for pride.
Okay. May the best man win. Go.

32:28.208 --> 32:30.000
-Anything?
-Uh...

32:30.083 --> 32:32.458
It's not the climate disaster of 2048.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.667
Or the tsunami of 2051.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.708
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

32:36.792 --> 32:38.208
2050.

32:38.292 --> 32:40.750
The extinction of the swallow...
Is that a thing?

32:40.833 --> 32:42.750
Completely screwed up the ecosystem.

32:42.833 --> 32:45.208
Krakatoa erupted in 2049 as well.

32:45.292 --> 32:46.500
No Kablooie.

32:46.583 --> 32:49.083
God, it's just one damn thing
after another, isn't it?

32:49.167 --> 32:52.333
-Cyclone, famine, volcanoes, floods...
-Got him.

32:55.792 --> 32:58.708
-That's where he is.
-MOBIUS: Alabama, 2050.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.833
You're gonna take my job
if I'm not careful.

33:04.875 --> 33:07.833
You want me to approve deployment
of a fully-armed task force to...

33:07.917 --> 33:09.958
-Yeah.
-...the Variant's potential hiding spot?

33:10.042 --> 33:11.833
Haven Hills, Alabama,
corporate town

33:11.917 --> 33:14.208
owned by Roxxcart until
it's wiped out by a hurricane.

33:14.292 --> 33:15.792
All the food and supplies you need.

33:15.875 --> 33:17.458
If he likes it, there's no reason

33:17.542 --> 33:20.333
he can't keep going back
and just camping out, over and over.

33:20.417 --> 33:22.625
And this is all based
on a theory from the Variant

33:22.708 --> 33:25.667
-who just blew your previous mission?
-Yeah, he's doing great.

33:25.750 --> 33:27.417
Mobius, as your friend,

33:27.500 --> 33:30.625
I have to tell you that trusting
this man is not a good idea.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.625
No. I know.
But maybe he's worth the trouble.

33:32.708 --> 33:34.667
He just uncovered
a huge hole in our security.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.292
That's what concerns me!

33:37.208 --> 33:39.125
I can handle him. Trust me.

33:39.208 --> 33:40.750
This is where we get our guy.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.417
You, I trust, but him.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.500
Listen, Ravonna,
every instinct is telling me

33:44.583 --> 33:46.417
this is where we nail the Variant.

33:48.792 --> 33:51.333
Come on. You don't see me
usually this worked up, right?

33:51.417 --> 33:53.000
I'm excited.

33:53.083 --> 33:55.083
I'm chomping at the bit.

33:57.125 --> 33:59.542
-Okay.
-Yes. Okay.

33:59.625 --> 34:00.833
-But, Mobius?
-Yeah?

34:02.792 --> 34:05.417
There's not much I can do
if it doesn't work out.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.875
For all time.

34:06.958 --> 34:08.417
Always.

34:08.500 --> 34:09.583
Okay.

34:18.458 --> 34:19.833
We're on.

34:23.708 --> 34:25.458
We are doing some good work today.

34:25.542 --> 34:26.667
I thought so too.

34:26.750 --> 34:29.333
I'm tellin' you.
You actually help us catch this Variant,

34:29.417 --> 34:30.958
and who knows, my friend.

34:31.042 --> 34:33.750
What, good enough for a face-to-face
with the Time-Keepers?

34:33.833 --> 34:34.833
I didn't say that.

34:34.917 --> 34:37.333
-One step at a time.
-All right. One step at a time.

34:37.417 --> 34:39.583
-Just in case.
-Yeah, don't those feel...

34:39.667 --> 34:41.208
Absolutely not.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.667
Gather around for a briefing.

34:46.500 --> 34:49.750
Roxxcart is a vast superstore
common to the era.

34:50.625 --> 34:53.333
It consists of a series
of sprawling sections,

34:53.417 --> 34:55.583
including a large warehouse.

34:55.667 --> 34:59.833
This warehouse is being used by civilians
as a shelter tryin' to ride out the storm.

34:59.917 --> 35:02.750
Remember, this is a class ten apocalypse.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.833
While the Variant
shouldn't know we're coming,

35:04.917 --> 35:07.833
he could be hiding anywhere
and should be considered hostile.

35:07.917 --> 35:09.417
So stay alert.

35:09.500 --> 35:13.625
Every time there is an attack,
the Variant steals a reset charge.

35:13.708 --> 35:15.125
He's planning something.

35:15.208 --> 35:16.542
We just don't know what.

35:16.625 --> 35:19.000
So keep an eye out
for the missing charges,

35:19.083 --> 35:22.667
and if you see a Loki, prune it.

35:24.167 --> 35:26.167
The bad Loki, preferably.

35:56.750 --> 35:57.792
Anything?

35:57.875 --> 36:00.083
Nothing yet. Move out!

36:20.375 --> 36:21.667
The hell was that?

36:23.000 --> 36:26.625
That was me using magic to dry my clothes.

36:27.875 --> 36:31.375
So I don't announce myself with every
squeaky footstep like the rest of you.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.583
HUNTER B-15: Take both teams
and sweep the storm shelter.

36:36.667 --> 36:38.292
-Yes, ma'am.
-MOBIUS: Loki and I are gonna

36:38.375 --> 36:40.042
check out the Green House. We'll meet...

36:40.125 --> 36:42.250
-No.
-No?

36:42.333 --> 36:44.167
You go with D-90. He stays with me.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.292
What are you...
He's under my supervision.

36:46.375 --> 36:47.917
This is my field op, Mobius.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.542
-If he's not a threat, then...
-Of course he's a threat.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.167
-Remember the Time Theater?
-Mobius...

36:52.250 --> 36:54.417
-I want him with me.
-You are welcome to go back

36:54.500 --> 36:57.250
to the TVA and litigate
with Renslayer, but right now...

36:57.333 --> 36:58.875
We're here. We're not going back.

36:58.958 --> 37:01.750
-The Variant is here.
-Mobius, it's fine. It's fine.

37:02.750 --> 37:03.833
You can trust me.

37:05.042 --> 37:10.000
I understand
I have to earn that, so, I will.

37:13.083 --> 37:16.917
Why is it the people you can't trust
are always saying, "Trust me"?

37:18.583 --> 37:20.833
Okay, try to hang on
to your Time Collar this time.

37:20.917 --> 37:22.583
We'll see you in the showroom.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.958
I am glad we're getting
to spend this time together.

38:01.042 --> 38:02.042
-Quiet.
-

38:02.125 --> 38:03.833
-I'm saying we got off on the wrong...
-Shh.

38:15.833 --> 38:17.083
HUNTER B-15: Hey!

38:17.167 --> 38:18.958
Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

38:19.042 --> 38:20.458
What are you doing?

38:20.542 --> 38:22.292
Shopping for plants.

38:24.292 --> 38:25.583
In this storm?

38:26.375 --> 38:27.792
It's a hurricane sale.

38:27.875 --> 38:29.667
Azaleas are half off.

38:30.250 --> 38:31.542
Could that be you?

38:34.167 --> 38:38.250
I mean, I probably would have
worn a suit, but, yes, maybe.

38:53.375 --> 38:54.625
Is he dead?

38:54.708 --> 38:57.292
No. They usually survive.

39:02.292 --> 39:07.667
So, you're the fool
the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

39:11.208 --> 39:13.625
Me, I presume.

39:13.708 --> 39:18.125
Please. If anyone's anyone, you're me.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.792
How nice to meet you.

39:24.875 --> 39:27.917
NEWS ANCHOR: For the past hour
we have seen winds intensifying.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.667
-Again, if you're just tuning in...
-

39:30.750 --> 39:32.958
HUNTER D-90: Check the bags
for the reset charges.

39:33.042 --> 39:34.833
You guys FEMA?

39:34.917 --> 39:35.958
National Guard?

39:36.625 --> 39:37.917
Could be any one of them.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.333
Well, hey, if you got
a 'copter or other transport,

39:41.417 --> 39:42.583
now is the time to use it.

39:42.667 --> 39:46.250
We got women and kids,
and that weather ain't playin'.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.833
No, I'm sorry. We don't.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.750
Well, how the heck did you get here?

39:52.667 --> 39:53.667
What are you doing?

39:53.750 --> 39:56.833
Hey! These people are scared.

39:58.250 --> 40:00.250
They're about to die.
They should be scared.

40:00.333 --> 40:01.625
Okay. Not of us.

40:02.375 --> 40:03.375
-Sir!
-Take it easy.

40:04.625 --> 40:05.875
What is it?

40:08.000 --> 40:11.792
It's real. It's real. It's real.

40:11.875 --> 40:15.750
It's real. It's real. It's real.

40:20.583 --> 40:22.333
Enchantment is a clever trick.

40:22.417 --> 40:25.792
Cowardly, a bit amateur-ish, but clever.

40:25.875 --> 40:29.458
Almost as cowardly as working for the TVA.

40:30.125 --> 40:31.333
I'm working for me.

40:31.458 --> 40:33.417
You really believe that,
don't you?

40:33.500 --> 40:34.500
Yeah.

40:35.667 --> 40:38.958
And here I was worried
that they'd found a better version of me.

40:39.042 --> 40:41.208
Hi, are you guys looking
for the disaster shelter?

40:41.292 --> 40:42.375
No.

40:55.250 --> 40:57.000
THE VARIANT: Oh, bless.

40:58.583 --> 41:01.958
Are you going to call your little friends
for help?

41:12.625 --> 41:14.250
LOKI: What's the matter?

41:14.333 --> 41:16.792
You too scared to meet me face-to-face?

41:17.833 --> 41:18.875
Show yourself.

41:20.750 --> 41:23.417
You know, gaining their confidence
was no mean feat.

41:27.625 --> 41:29.667
Oh, my God.

41:30.958 --> 41:32.250
You went undercover.

41:33.667 --> 41:36.500
If you could possibly sheathe
your smarm for a moment,

41:36.583 --> 41:38.708
I have an offer for you.
That's why I found you.

41:40.042 --> 41:41.125
Go on.

41:43.208 --> 41:45.500
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.

41:47.583 --> 41:50.625
And, uh, cards on the table,

41:51.583 --> 41:53.750
I could use a qualified lieutenant.

41:56.083 --> 41:59.083
And I assume you mean... Me?

41:59.958 --> 42:01.292
What say you...

42:03.042 --> 42:04.042
Loki?

42:04.167 --> 42:06.667
Ugh. Don't call me that.

42:07.833 --> 42:09.167
You can call me...

42:11.500 --> 42:12.500
Randy.

42:13.542 --> 42:15.875
God. Now I understand
why Thor found this so annoying.

42:15.958 --> 42:18.625
Enough with your games.
I've been trying to help you.

42:18.708 --> 42:21.417
I kept them vulnerable
at the Renaissance Fair for some time.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.500
Oh, gosh,
and that was just so nice of you.

42:23.583 --> 42:28.042
But after eight to ten seconds
of consideration,

42:28.125 --> 42:29.583
the answer is no.

42:30.833 --> 42:33.917
I'm not interested in ruling
the Time Variance Authority.

42:40.083 --> 42:42.000
HUNTER C-20: It's real. It's real.

42:42.083 --> 42:44.125
It was real. It was real.

42:44.208 --> 42:45.833
-What's real? What's...
-It's real.

42:45.917 --> 42:47.542
-She's off the dial.
-It's real.

42:47.625 --> 42:49.458
-MOBIUS: Look at me.
-It's real.

42:49.542 --> 42:50.542
I wanna go home.

42:51.208 --> 42:52.583
We're gonna get you there.

42:53.583 --> 42:55.292
Call the TVA, let the infirmary know...

42:55.375 --> 42:57.333
No, no, no. I gave it away.

42:58.625 --> 43:00.583
-I gave it away.
-What did you give away...

43:00.667 --> 43:02.500
The Time-Keepers, where they are.

43:03.875 --> 43:06.083
I gave it away how to find them.

43:07.583 --> 43:09.250
B-15, what is your status?

43:11.042 --> 43:14.375
B-15, come in. What's your status?

43:17.500 --> 43:19.333
B-15, do you copy?

43:33.750 --> 43:36.750
If you don't wanna rule the TVA,
then what do you want?

43:36.833 --> 43:38.542
It doesn't matter. You're too late.

43:38.625 --> 43:40.667
I think you'll find
I'm well ahead of schedule.

43:40.750 --> 43:42.500
I found your hiding place like that.

43:42.583 --> 43:45.333
I'd say that makes me
the superior Loki, wouldn't you?

43:46.625 --> 43:50.042
I see. That's your plan.

43:50.125 --> 43:53.333
Lure us all here
so you can blow the place up.

43:58.500 --> 44:01.458
-

44:04.500 --> 44:05.583
I miss Randy.

44:06.583 --> 44:09.625
-

44:09.708 --> 44:12.083
Thank you for helping me stall for time.

44:12.167 --> 44:14.333
You really do love to hear yourself talk.

44:14.458 --> 44:17.083
You're the first person
to tell me that.

44:22.833 --> 44:24.500
I would never treat me like this.

44:25.375 --> 44:26.375
Hi.

44:35.292 --> 44:37.500
Oh, come on. Stop hiding.

44:51.875 --> 44:55.042
Loki, if you had any honor
you'd fight me as yourself.

44:55.125 --> 44:56.500
I have shit to do.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.958
-

45:10.000 --> 45:11.375
-HUNTER B-15: Mobius.
-Where is he?

45:11.458 --> 45:13.167
-I lost him.
-What happened?

45:13.250 --> 45:14.292
I...

45:14.375 --> 45:16.250
Looks like your favorite
Loki betrayed you.

45:16.333 --> 45:17.417
MOBIUS: Just move!

45:42.875 --> 45:44.875
What do you want from me?

45:44.958 --> 45:46.250
What is this about?

45:51.208 --> 45:53.625
THE VARIANT: Brace yourself, Loki.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.792
-

45:58.750 --> 46:00.625
What do you want from me?

46:00.708 --> 46:02.417
What do you want from me?

46:02.500 --> 46:04.208
What do you want from me?

46:04.292 --> 46:05.542
What is this about?

46:05.625 --> 46:06.917
What do you want from me?

46:07.000 --> 46:09.083
What is this about?

46:09.167 --> 46:11.458
What do you want from me?

46:11.542 --> 46:13.125
What do you want from me?

46:13.208 --> 46:14.958
What is this about?

46:15.042 --> 46:17.292
What is this about?

46:17.375 --> 46:19.250
This isn't about you.

46:22.542 --> 46:23.667
Right.

46:58.042 --> 46:59.250
Where they going?

47:05.375 --> 47:06.792
That's not possible.

47:10.667 --> 47:15.083
This is Analyst 1182-E,
uh, reporting a code, uh, 000.

47:15.167 --> 47:17.208
Branches rapidly forming at a slope...

47:17.292 --> 47:19.333
Somebody just bombed the Sacred Timeline.

48:07.833 --> 48:09.292
MOBIUS: Loki!

48:10.625 --> 48:11.833
Loki, wait!

48:11.917 --> 48:14.208
Wait! Loki, wait!

48:17.792 --> 48:19.458
No! Wait, Loki!

48:20.958 --> 48:21.958
Damn it!
