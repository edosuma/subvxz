WEBVTT

00:38.480 --> 00:40.146
I got everything you need.

00:40.148 --> 00:42.108
Scarves aren't just for warmth.
They're for style.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.287
<i>My name is Nick Barrow.</i>

00:50.559 --> 00:52.325
<i>And I plan heists.</i>

00:52.327 --> 00:56.129
...and scarves! Fedoras. Come here.
I got ties...

00:58.433 --> 01:01.634
<i>There's a few rules to keep
in mind when planning a job.</i>

01:01.636 --> 01:03.436
Scarves, hats!

01:03.438 --> 01:06.506
<i>The easiest place to hide
is in plain sight.</i>

01:06.508 --> 01:08.475
Got it.
Whatcha got, sir, huh?

01:08.477 --> 01:11.110
I got ties!
I got fedoras!

01:11.112 --> 01:12.912
<i>Design the job in a way</i>

01:12.914 --> 01:14.481
<i>so that no one gets hurt.</i>

01:19.621 --> 01:21.354
<i>Timing is everything.</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:27.560
Let's go! Step up!

01:29.498 --> 01:33.166
<i>Finally, every mark has a
weakness that can be exploited.</i>

01:34.836 --> 01:37.270
<i>You just gotta find it.</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:42.509
- Yeah?
<i>- It's Alejandro.</i>

01:42.511 --> 01:44.410
<i>I am interested in the job.</i>

01:45.447 --> 01:46.746
<i>Are you ready to meet?</i>

01:48.550 --> 01:49.830
I am now.

01:52.954 --> 01:56.389
<i>The criminal underworld
is a complicated ecosystem.</i>

01:56.391 --> 01:59.058
<i>Everyone relies on
each other just to survive.</i>

02:00.695 --> 02:03.029
<i>It all starts
with your bottom feeders.</i>

02:03.031 --> 02:05.698
<i>They're always on the lookout
for opportunities.</i>

02:05.700 --> 02:07.534
<i>They find the job.</i>

02:07.536 --> 02:09.235
<i>This guy is Jimmy Lincoln.</i>

02:10.572 --> 02:12.305
<i>Then it moves up to me.</i>

02:12.307 --> 02:15.675
<i>I design the plan of
how to pull off the heist.</i>

02:15.677 --> 02:17.510
<i>Every little detail,</i>

02:17.512 --> 02:18.778
<i>inside and out.</i>

02:20.515 --> 02:21.881
<i>And finally at the top</i>

02:21.883 --> 02:23.483
<i>sits the buyer,</i>

02:23.485 --> 02:25.752
<i>the one who actually
pulls off the job</i>

02:25.754 --> 02:27.654
<i>and takes all the risk.</i>

02:27.656 --> 02:29.222
$30,000 up front.

02:30.725 --> 02:32.759
30,000.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.994
I tell you how to get in.
I tell you how to get out.

02:34.996 --> 02:36.963
Everything in between is on you.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.267
So we just gotta trust you.

02:41.269 --> 02:42.769
Is that it?

02:42.771 --> 02:44.504
Listen to me, Nick.

02:44.506 --> 02:46.339
If you want my money,

02:46.341 --> 02:48.775
I'm going to need something
more reassuring than that.

02:48.777 --> 02:51.044
Alejandro,

02:51.046 --> 02:52.946
I'm not here to talk you
into this.

02:54.182 --> 02:56.115
I'm here to let you do this.

02:56.117 --> 02:57.817
It's yes or no.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.789
The 250,000
is in an evidence locker

03:02.791 --> 03:04.123
at the Fulton County Courthouse,

03:04.125 --> 03:05.792
and I'm gonna tell you
how to take it.

03:05.794 --> 03:08.528
If something
unexpected happens?

03:08.530 --> 03:11.698
If I do my job right, it won't.
And if it does?

03:11.700 --> 03:13.933
Doesn't come with
a money-back guarantee, kid.

03:15.103 --> 03:16.636
But having said that,

03:16.638 --> 03:18.705
I make sure you go in
with everything that you need...

03:18.707 --> 03:21.774
access codes, schematics,
schedules, equipment.

03:21.776 --> 03:23.910
Once we start,

03:23.912 --> 03:26.212
how much time do we have
to get to the spot?

03:26.214 --> 03:28.615
Fifteen minutes.
It's tight but doable.

03:41.296 --> 03:42.996
You miss your window,

03:42.998 --> 03:44.564
that's it.

03:44.566 --> 03:45.832
You want a second chance,

03:45.834 --> 03:48.434
I start all over.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.436
You pay me again.

03:53.575 --> 03:55.908
Oh, boy, you better be good.

03:55.910 --> 03:58.845
Look, guys, this is like nothing
that you've ever done before.

03:59.914 --> 04:01.314
The timing here is everything.

04:01.316 --> 04:03.416
Once you start,
you cannot stop.

04:28.510 --> 04:30.276
And once we're there?

04:30.278 --> 04:31.978
You will have exactly
the amount of time

04:31.980 --> 04:34.180
it takes a traffic light
to go from green to red

04:34.182 --> 04:36.416
and back again...
three minutes.

04:44.693 --> 04:46.125
I want you to think of it

04:46.127 --> 04:49.262
like it's a, uh...
a magic trick.

04:51.633 --> 04:54.400
Half of it is engineering.

04:54.402 --> 04:55.802
And the other half?

04:55.804 --> 04:56.936
Magic.

05:24.566 --> 05:26.999
Freeze! Clear!

05:28.069 --> 05:29.068
What the hell's going on?

05:29.070 --> 05:30.203
Is your cargo secure?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.205
Cargo, uh?

05:32.207 --> 05:34.741
My rig's empty.
I'm here to pick up.

06:22.724 --> 06:24.490
Whoo-hoo!

07:05.300 --> 07:06.399
Pack it up.

07:33.228 --> 07:34.660
<i>I was fucked,</i>

07:34.662 --> 07:37.063
<i>and I didn't even know it.</i>

07:37.065 --> 07:38.798
<i>Perhaps the reason
any of this happened</i>

07:38.800 --> 07:40.366
<i>is because I was distracted.</i>

07:42.070 --> 07:43.870
<i>Catherine Jill Barrow,</i>

07:43.872 --> 07:46.372
<i>otherwise known as Cate,
my daughter.</i>

07:46.374 --> 07:48.207
<i>Sure, she could pick me
out of a crowd,</i>

07:48.209 --> 07:50.877
<i>but we never really spent
any time together.</i>

07:50.879 --> 07:53.045
<i>No one loves that kid
more than me,</i>

07:53.047 --> 07:56.716
<i>but our situation
is a little, uh... complicated.</i>

08:03.591 --> 08:05.691
Our boss wants to renegotiate.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.393
You're not getting
a dime from me.

08:11.733 --> 08:13.900
<i>So the deal is this...</i>

08:13.902 --> 08:16.602
<i>I protect her
and provide from afar,</i>

08:16.604 --> 08:19.839
<i>while my ex, Lucy,
takes care of the day-to-day.</i>

08:19.841 --> 08:23.676
<i>Keep my world
out of her world.</i>

08:23.678 --> 08:26.178
<i>It's better for everyone
the more I stay removed,</i>

08:26.180 --> 08:27.446
<i>especially Cate.</i>

08:29.083 --> 08:30.716
<i>She's a good kid.</i>

08:30.718 --> 08:32.217
<i>She's growing up right.</i>

08:32.220 --> 08:33.852
<i>But she just turned 16</i>

08:33.855 --> 08:36.322
<i>and developed a complete
lack of judgment.</i>

08:38.293 --> 08:39.725
<i>The charge was
underage drinking,</i>

08:39.727 --> 08:41.360
<i>hardly a high crime,</i>

08:41.361 --> 08:43.282
<i>but I'd like her
to have a direction.</i>

08:45.300 --> 08:47.400
<i>One thing's for sure...</i>

08:47.402 --> 08:49.502
<i>I want her to have
a better life.</i>

08:54.609 --> 08:56.909
<i>In my line of work,
there's not many people</i>

08:56.911 --> 08:58.411
<i>you can trust for advice.</i>

08:58.413 --> 09:00.713
<i>Thankfully, I have Harper.</i>

09:00.715 --> 09:02.081
<i>He got me into this business,</i>

09:02.083 --> 09:03.582
<i>and he's my best friend.</i>

09:03.584 --> 09:05.451
Still hanging out with cops?

09:05.453 --> 09:08.587
Murph is one of the most
respected guys on the force.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.589
We've known each other
since we were kids.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.291
He's still a cop.
Makes me nervous.

09:12.293 --> 09:14.994
Good. We're crooks.
They should make you nervous.

09:14.996 --> 09:16.896
When you get older and wiser,

09:16.898 --> 09:19.298
you'll realize that's why
I play poker with them.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.600
Look, Harp, I came here to
talk to you about something.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.502
What, about your bad haircut?

09:23.504 --> 09:25.771
Don't start with my hair again.
I like my hair.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.806
It's perfect.

09:26.808 --> 09:27.807
Perfect.

09:27.809 --> 09:28.975
It's current.

09:28.977 --> 09:30.309
I blend in.

09:30.311 --> 09:32.511
I look like a regular guy
at Wal-Mart.

09:32.513 --> 09:35.081
Wal-Mart, 1972 maybe.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.615
Okay, can we get
out of here?

09:36.617 --> 09:37.984
I am here to shoot.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.936
Really.

09:56.938 --> 09:59.005
I'm serious, Harp.
It's important.

09:59.007 --> 10:01.774
And what do I owe the pleasure
of you ruining my Saturday?

10:01.776 --> 10:03.542
My teenage daughter.

10:03.544 --> 10:07.279
My Saturday's fucked.

10:08.883 --> 10:12.284
I go by Cate's recital.
She's a no show.

10:12.286 --> 10:14.787
All I want is for my daughter
to be able to handle

10:14.789 --> 10:16.455
the things that come
at her in life.

10:16.457 --> 10:18.124
Well, call me crazy,

10:18.126 --> 10:20.292
but what about talking
to the ex?

10:20.294 --> 10:21.794
Where's the fucking gun?

10:21.796 --> 10:23.062
Oh, Nicky.

10:23.064 --> 10:24.830
I've tried to reach out
a couple times

10:24.832 --> 10:27.166
to have a conversation,
and she just goes nuclear.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.534
You're never going
to resolve this

10:28.536 --> 10:30.369
if you guys can't even
talk to each other,

10:30.371 --> 10:32.405
which, by the way,
is all kids want.

10:32.407 --> 10:35.374
They want their parents
to get along,

10:35.376 --> 10:37.043
or at least be able to talk.

10:37.045 --> 10:39.145
Look, Harper, I get it.
I'm a crook.

10:39.147 --> 10:40.913
We made a deal,
and a deal's a deal.

10:40.915 --> 10:43.049
Things have taken a turn
for the worse.

10:43.051 --> 10:44.350
So what's different?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.085
What's different now
is that her mom,

10:46.087 --> 10:48.254
she's checked into rehab,
she's doing a stint,

10:48.256 --> 10:49.922
and Cate's a teenager.

10:49.924 --> 10:52.558
She's a 16 year old, Harper,
with 16-year-old problems.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.860
She's got boobs
and hormones.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.763
She's hanging out with a group
of dopey kids making bad choices.

10:57.765 --> 11:00.533
She needs some guidance
in life, but I wouldn't be good at that.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.334
I don't know how to
teach her that stuff.

11:02.336 --> 11:04.737
It's a fucking problem.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.677
What I wanna know is how the
hell did you convince your mom

11:11.679 --> 11:13.919
to let you stay here
by yourself?

11:14.849 --> 11:16.515
Well, when your mom's
packing for detox,

11:16.517 --> 11:19.285
you can pretty much get her
to sign off on anything.

11:19.287 --> 11:22.254
Like, what do you do when you're
all by yourself and you get bored?

11:22.256 --> 11:24.256
Since I don't have
any family around,

11:24.258 --> 11:26.592
what I always do...
go to Becca's.

11:26.594 --> 11:28.027
Cheers to that.

11:34.435 --> 11:36.735
Seriously, no shit like that.

11:36.737 --> 11:40.539
Who cares?
I won. I won, Jeremy.

11:40.541 --> 11:42.942
Let's go, Jeremy. Keys.

11:42.944 --> 11:44.477
All right, look.
This is my baby.

11:44.479 --> 11:46.045
Is it your baby?

11:46.047 --> 11:47.379
Well, you should probably
wash it more often.

11:47.381 --> 11:49.381
Come on, keys.

11:49.383 --> 11:51.317
Oh, you actually got the keys.

11:54.555 --> 11:56.322
Where are we going?

12:04.165 --> 12:05.498
Hey, Harp.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.099
Alejandro is dead.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.167
<i>What?</i>

12:08.169 --> 12:10.002
<i>He's dead.</i>

12:10.004 --> 12:11.237
They're all dead.

12:11.239 --> 12:12.571
You got a problem.

12:12.573 --> 12:14.140
<i>You've been framed, Nick.</i>

12:14.142 --> 12:16.502
<i>Meet me at your place
in five minutes.</i>

12:19.113 --> 12:22.314
What the fuck is going on here?
My hands aren't in this thing.

12:22.316 --> 12:26.085
Alejandro's father
is Victor Vasquez.

12:26.087 --> 12:29.522
He's the head of a major
drug cartel in Mexico.

12:29.524 --> 12:33.926
There are cemeteries in business
because of Victor Vasquez.

12:33.928 --> 12:36.996
Now, this guy
is very dangerous,

12:36.998 --> 12:39.165
and we don't know
what he thinks happened.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.100
This is a Christmas card

12:41.102 --> 12:43.135
he sends out when
someone crosses him.

12:43.137 --> 12:46.338
Serves as a message to anyone
who might do the same.

12:46.340 --> 12:49.141
He's not someone
you want coming after you.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.343
Look, I'm the one
that provides for Cate.

12:51.345 --> 12:53.345
If anything was to happen to me,
worst-case scenario,

12:53.347 --> 12:55.347
I've got to make sure
that she's taken care of.

12:55.349 --> 12:57.216
Oh, Nick.

12:57.218 --> 12:59.451
I think I got a move.
I can do it quick.

12:59.453 --> 13:02.388
Then you go.
You go and you go quick.

13:06.894 --> 13:09.028
What is it that you're
looking for, Mr. Barrow?

13:09.030 --> 13:11.697
Something for
the immediate future.

13:11.699 --> 13:15.834
All right, well then,
I would suggest our term life policy.

13:15.836 --> 13:19.638
A premium on a $500,000
life insurance policy would be...

13:19.640 --> 13:21.106
Does that cover me?

13:23.144 --> 13:24.577
What's next?

13:24.579 --> 13:26.078
You have
any felony convictions

13:26.080 --> 13:28.347
less than three years ago?
Do you skydive?

13:28.349 --> 13:29.348
No.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.916
Are you a pilot?
No.

13:30.918 --> 13:33.886
Do you drink? Smoke?
Well, more than I should

13:33.888 --> 13:35.688
but not always enough.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.723
I assume that carries
an overage premium?

13:37.725 --> 13:40.426
It does.
Okay. What else?

13:41.929 --> 13:45.164
Well, I guess the name
of your beneficiary.

13:45.166 --> 13:47.900
Cate... uh, Catherine.
Catherine Jill Barrow.

13:47.902 --> 13:51.570
This is the name of her bank.

13:51.572 --> 13:54.106
Her account number,
and I'd like to prepay any taxes.

13:56.177 --> 13:58.177
All right.
Well, um...

13:58.179 --> 14:00.412
I will write up
the policy, file it,

14:00.414 --> 14:02.448
and pending your blood work
in about three weeks,

14:02.450 --> 14:04.450
you will get confirmation
of your coverage.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.519
After that,
you can jaywalk all you want.

14:09.857 --> 14:13.626
Charger. It's used.
Tags. Gas. Plates are clean.

14:13.628 --> 14:15.261
Where is it?

14:15.263 --> 14:16.962
Alley behind Derian's.

14:16.964 --> 14:18.197
You be smart.

14:18.199 --> 14:19.932
Then lay low
at the safe house

14:19.934 --> 14:21.800
till we can see
how this plays out.

14:28.142 --> 14:29.775
Yeah.

14:29.777 --> 14:33.012
<i>Mr. Barrow, do you know
who this is?</i>

14:34.248 --> 14:35.881
How did you get this number?

14:35.883 --> 14:38.217
<i>I know people.</i>

14:38.219 --> 14:39.885
<i>We need to talk, Nick.</i>

14:39.887 --> 14:41.553
Isn't that what
we're doing now?

14:41.555 --> 14:42.955
<i>In person.</i>

14:42.957 --> 14:44.456
Impossible.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.392
<i>I've been doing this
a long time,</i>

14:46.394 --> 14:48.060
<i>and you know what I've learned?</i>
What?

14:48.062 --> 14:50.095
<i>That anything is possible.</i>

15:08.949 --> 15:10.749
<i>Being interrogated
by a cartel leader</i>

15:10.751 --> 15:13.919
<i>is not how I expected
my day to start out.</i>

15:13.921 --> 15:16.522
<i>This is bad, really bad.</i>

15:16.524 --> 15:18.857
<i>All I could do was try
my best to stay calm,</i>

15:18.859 --> 15:21.627
<i>keep my mouth shut,
and not rat out Jimmy Lincoln.</i>

15:21.629 --> 15:23.829
<i>I've been around
long enough to know,</i>

15:23.831 --> 15:26.565
<i>you start talking,
you end up dead.</i>

15:50.191 --> 15:52.291
Mr. Barrow.

15:52.293 --> 15:54.293
Nick.

15:54.295 --> 15:56.528
Can I call you Nick?

15:56.530 --> 15:58.430
Yeah.

15:59.867 --> 16:02.534
I'm going to ask you
a few questions.

16:02.536 --> 16:03.569
We're just talking.

16:03.571 --> 16:06.305
And you answer them honestly...

16:08.309 --> 16:10.209
and we're fine.

16:10.211 --> 16:12.010
You go your way,
I'll go mine.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.045
Hm?

16:14.315 --> 16:16.081
And because I understand

16:16.083 --> 16:18.317
this is an extremely
awkward situation,

16:18.319 --> 16:20.279
I'm going to start
with an easy one.

16:24.392 --> 16:26.552
Who else did you sell
the job to?

16:27.895 --> 16:29.661
No one.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.607
You don't, uh...

16:41.609 --> 16:44.376
It doesn't go like that.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.212
I didn't find the job,
I just planned it.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.647
Who found this one?

16:58.692 --> 17:01.693
Then that puts us at a bit
of a crossroads, my friend.

17:05.366 --> 17:08.567
I know deep down...
I know you know something.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.804
A name, an address, a number.
Something.

17:13.973 --> 17:15.307
I don't know.

17:25.219 --> 17:27.618
I feel I can tell you
that at some point

17:27.621 --> 17:29.902
I'm gonna end up
losing my patience.

17:35.296 --> 17:38.664
"Catherine." Wife?

17:38.666 --> 17:39.998
Victor, listen to me.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.600
Or daughter?
Listen to me.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.669
I designed it,
that's it.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.037
Daughter.

17:55.850 --> 17:58.116
We're making progress.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.153
So I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get your daughter.

18:01.155 --> 18:03.055
In the meantime...

18:04.492 --> 18:06.158
make yourself at home.

18:10.631 --> 18:11.697
Good.

18:13.434 --> 18:15.067
I feel good about this.

18:53.207 --> 18:54.973
I'm gonna get some water.

18:54.975 --> 18:56.041
I'm just gonna...

18:56.043 --> 18:57.643
Easy, easy.

19:14.728 --> 19:16.194
Don't do it!
Stand! Stay!

19:16.196 --> 19:17.563
Stop it!

19:29.043 --> 19:31.076
Victor found me.
He thinks I double sold the job.

19:31.078 --> 19:32.678
Someone else put
their hands in this.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.680
<i>Where's Jimmy Lincoln?</i>
I don't know.

19:34.682 --> 19:37.015
I need you to find him
for me. Cate's not safe.

19:37.017 --> 19:38.050
Where is she?

19:38.052 --> 19:39.484
I'm going to get her now.

19:52.933 --> 19:54.533
Cate, it's okay.

19:54.535 --> 19:56.034
Please, we gotta go.
They're going to be here soon.

19:56.036 --> 19:57.235
Who's gonna be here soon?

19:57.237 --> 19:58.604
Guys that're trying
to kill me.

19:58.606 --> 20:00.038
What the hell are
you doing here?

20:00.040 --> 20:01.280
Okay, listen.
We got to... Cate!

20:02.443 --> 20:04.076
Cate, please!

20:04.078 --> 20:05.477
We gotta get out of here.

20:06.714 --> 20:08.046
Cate...

20:09.416 --> 20:11.550
What, are you kidnapping me?

20:11.552 --> 20:12.884
I'm not kidnapping you.

20:12.886 --> 20:14.886
Parents kidnap kids
all the time.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.393
I'm sorry.
We gotta go quick.

20:33.474 --> 20:35.340
Let's go.
No, fuck this.

20:35.342 --> 20:37.809
I'm not moving until
you tell me what's going on.

20:37.811 --> 20:39.444
Cate, trust me.
It's a long story,

20:39.446 --> 20:41.246
but if you want to live,
you'll start listening.

20:41.248 --> 20:42.648
Trust you?
I don't even know you.

20:42.650 --> 20:43.815
I'm not going anywhere.

20:43.817 --> 20:45.097
You don't have a choice.

21:39.039 --> 21:40.472
What's going on?

22:18.879 --> 22:20.212
This is where you live?

22:20.214 --> 22:21.847
No.

22:23.350 --> 22:24.683
It's kinda shitty.

22:24.685 --> 22:26.551
It's just a place to stay
until I...

22:26.553 --> 22:27.833
You're a thief, right?

22:29.690 --> 22:32.170
That's what Mom said.
You steal stuff, right?

22:33.594 --> 22:34.826
Yeah.

22:35.929 --> 22:38.063
You must really suck at it.

22:38.065 --> 22:41.133
It's not, uh...
I have another place.

22:41.135 --> 22:43.068
We just can't go there.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.369
Whatever.

22:46.540 --> 22:48.060
Don't.

22:48.742 --> 22:49.741
What?

22:49.743 --> 22:51.109
It can be traced.

22:51.111 --> 22:52.844
It's not good anymore.
What...

22:54.381 --> 22:55.781
That... That's
my fucking phone!

22:55.783 --> 22:59.084
Those are my friends.
What are you doing?

22:59.086 --> 23:00.285
People follow us
through those phones.

23:00.287 --> 23:01.887
How long am I gonna be here?

23:01.889 --> 23:03.221
I don't know.

23:03.223 --> 23:05.023
I'm hungry.
Got anything for me to eat?

23:06.093 --> 23:07.225
No.

23:07.227 --> 23:08.293
Where are we going?

23:08.295 --> 23:09.761
That's still up in the air.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.631
Wow.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.332
You really planned
this out, huh?

23:14.334 --> 23:15.967
Give me a little time.

23:15.969 --> 23:18.329
Things have changed.
I'll figure it out, okay?

23:23.911 --> 23:26.244

24:34.214 --> 24:36.681

I want to go home.

24:36.683 --> 24:37.983
You can't.
You're not safe.

24:43.557 --> 24:47.225
Look, at this age

24:47.227 --> 24:49.027
they're either angry
at the world,

24:49.029 --> 24:51.096
or they're just plain hostile.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.564
Then I'm lucky,
because she's both.

24:52.566 --> 24:54.566
I mean, how the hell
do you do it?

24:54.568 --> 24:56.101
How do I do it?

24:56.103 --> 24:57.369
Unless my kids need money,

24:57.371 --> 24:59.070
they pretty much ignore me.

25:00.340 --> 25:02.774
You just, uh...

25:02.776 --> 25:04.709
You don't say anything
to make her mad.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.077
Everything makes her mad.

25:06.079 --> 25:07.279
Well, then choose
a safe topic.

25:07.281 --> 25:08.413

25:08.415 --> 25:11.082
I don't know.

25:17.624 --> 25:19.557
Your phone was out there
too long.

25:19.559 --> 25:20.859
Now...

25:20.861 --> 25:23.361
these should help.

25:23.363 --> 25:25.430
There's your three burners,
your SIMs.

25:25.432 --> 25:27.132
You switch them out
every night,

25:27.134 --> 25:28.533
and I'll do the same.

25:28.535 --> 25:30.935
Where are we at
with Jimmy Lincoln?

25:31.405 --> 25:34.039
Last known address.

25:34.041 --> 25:37.475

your neck out for me, Harp.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.782

25:45.886 --> 25:47.819
I don't think
I can do it, Harp.

25:47.821 --> 25:49.521
You have to.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.558
You don't have
a choice, Nick.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.214
And when you wake up tomorrow,

26:49.216 --> 26:50.949
nothing about that

27:15.876 --> 27:16.908

27:18.311 --> 27:20.645
Nope.

27:20.647 --> 27:22.881
My ex might.

27:22.883 --> 27:24.716
Got another one
down in the alley.

28:21.575 --> 28:24.375
Get in the car.
I'm not getting in the car, Nick.

28:24.377 --> 28:26.044
I don't want
to get in the car.

28:26.046 --> 28:27.946
No matter how bad you think
this thing has been,

28:27.948 --> 28:29.714
I promise you, it can get
a hell of a lot worse.

28:29.716 --> 28:31.950
Don't worry, Nick, all right?
You're off the hook.

28:31.952 --> 28:33.785
I'll get you a mug.
You tried your best.

28:33.787 --> 28:35.820
I've taken care of myself
my whole life.

28:35.822 --> 28:37.889
I can do it just fine now.
I'm going home.

28:37.891 --> 28:39.524
That's not an option.

28:41.895 --> 28:42.961
Option?

28:42.963 --> 28:45.930
When was I given an option?

28:45.932 --> 28:47.899
What choices have I gotten
to make, Nick?

28:47.901 --> 28:50.001
When do I get to pick
what I want?

28:50.003 --> 28:51.769
Because I certainly haven't had
any of that up until now.

28:51.771 --> 28:53.905
Goddamn it!
Cate, this isn't safe!

28:53.907 --> 28:55.607
Now, I'm done playing
around with you.

28:55.609 --> 28:58.243

29:23.803 --> 29:26.337

29:26.339 --> 29:27.539
Mama.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.677
Welcome home, Oscar.

29:37.684 --> 29:40.385
You have a beautiful family.

29:40.387 --> 29:43.721
I know you work with
the Atlanta Police Department.

29:43.723 --> 29:45.957
There is something
I need from you.

29:45.959 --> 29:47.559
Do you have a moment to talk?

29:51.198 --> 29:52.964
Daddy, twirl me!

29:52.966 --> 29:55.800

30:03.810 --> 30:05.243
Would you like to go swimming?

30:06.880 --> 30:09.147
In what?
I don't have any stuff.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.484
What are we doing here?

30:13.486 --> 30:15.053
You said you wanted stuff.

30:15.055 --> 30:16.888
I thought we weren't supposed
to be outside.

30:16.890 --> 30:18.323
It's not about being
inside or outside.

30:18.325 --> 30:19.891
It's about being smart,

30:19.893 --> 30:22.360
not drawing attention
to yourself, blending in.

30:22.362 --> 30:25.263
You check in a hotel
and you never leave, it's suspicious.

30:25.265 --> 30:27.498
You stand on the side
of the road screaming,

30:27.500 --> 30:29.367
and it looks like
you're being abducted.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.169
That draws attention.

30:31.171 --> 30:32.303
Here you go.

30:34.908 --> 30:36.374
What do you want me
to do with these?

30:36.376 --> 30:37.575
Swim.

30:37.577 --> 30:39.377
Oh, these aren't me.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.346
I'm out of my Hello Kitty phase.
You missed it.

30:41.348 --> 30:42.914
Cate, you said you wanted
to go swimming.

30:42.916 --> 30:45.450
Pick something or don't.
It's up to you.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.732
Fine, I wanna swim.

31:02.602 --> 31:05.470
I'm Adam
This is Ian and Ben.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.105
You here for
the off-road bike thing?

31:07.107 --> 31:08.640
'Cause I'm one of the drivers.

31:10.543 --> 31:12.443
Oh, no, no.
I'm just hanging out.

31:12.445 --> 31:13.478
With?

31:13.480 --> 31:14.712
Nick.

31:16.049 --> 31:18.583
My dad. Kind of.

31:18.585 --> 31:21.219
Nick, who's kind of your dad?

31:21.221 --> 31:22.820
Sounds kind of weird.

31:22.822 --> 31:24.922
Yeah, it is kind of weird.

31:24.924 --> 31:27.225
Is that your dad's Charger?

31:27.227 --> 31:28.826
God, I'd love to drive
that thing.

31:28.828 --> 31:30.028
You want a beer?

31:31.097 --> 31:32.797
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

31:39.839 --> 31:42.640
No more beer.
What?

31:42.642 --> 31:45.610
Drinking a beer is the safest
thing I've done with you yet.

31:45.612 --> 31:49.447
You're 16.
No more. Okay?

31:54.487 --> 31:56.120
Shit, it's my mom.

31:57.490 --> 31:58.623
Don't mention anything
about, uh...

31:58.625 --> 32:00.091
anything.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.194
Hey.
<i>Hey.</i>

32:03.196 --> 32:05.463
I tried calling your old number,
but no one answered.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.665
Then you texted me
this new number.

32:07.667 --> 32:11.336
Yeah, it was...
it was time for a new phone.

32:11.338 --> 32:12.837
Have you been drinking?

32:14.808 --> 32:17.008
<i>Drinking heavily was
something new for Lucy.</i>

32:17.010 --> 32:21.045
<i>She recently lost her mother,
and it hit her pretty hard.</i>

32:21.047 --> 32:22.380
<i>I tried to reach out,</i>

32:22.382 --> 32:25.316
<i>but she wouldn't have it.</i>

32:25.318 --> 32:27.885
<i>I just hope she could get
on the other side of things.</i>

32:29.389 --> 32:31.723
One minute, one hour,

32:31.725 --> 32:32.957
one day at a time.

32:32.959 --> 32:34.792
It's a choice, Mom.

32:34.794 --> 32:36.828
<i>I hope you're right.</i>

32:36.830 --> 32:39.397
Okay, you can do this.
Just go to bed.

32:39.399 --> 32:40.965
Okay.

32:40.967 --> 32:42.200
I love you.

32:42.202 --> 32:43.801
<i>I love you, too, Mom.</i>

32:57.317 --> 33:00.017
How much trouble are you in?

33:00.019 --> 33:01.819
A lot more
than I want to be in.

33:01.821 --> 33:04.422
Someone was murdered
and they think I did it.

33:05.658 --> 33:07.258
Did you?

33:07.260 --> 33:08.393
No.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.329
Huh.

33:11.331 --> 33:12.630
Then who did?

33:15.535 --> 33:16.901
That's why we're here.

33:21.007 --> 33:23.608
Yeah. No.
It's only called a fistula

33:23.610 --> 33:26.144
if it... if it opens up to
the outside of your body.

33:28.782 --> 33:30.448
Hang on a second.

33:30.450 --> 33:31.730
I gotta call you back, Jake.

33:36.289 --> 33:38.356
What's going on?

33:38.358 --> 33:40.558
Okay, you know, I don't like
people in my space.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.959
Okay? And I can't find my cat.

33:41.961 --> 33:43.761
Have you seen Patches?

33:43.763 --> 33:45.430
Did you see a Calico run out the
door when you opened the door?

33:45.432 --> 33:47.465
C-Could we do...
I-I'm happy to have you here.

33:47.467 --> 33:48.866
But could we... could we
do this in the hallway?

33:48.868 --> 33:51.936
We can talk in the hallway.

33:51.938 --> 33:54.939
All right, just don't...
Please, don't touch anything.

33:54.941 --> 33:56.374
Who's the... What...
Who's the girl?

33:56.376 --> 33:57.942
Never you mind.
His daughter.

33:57.944 --> 33:59.277
His daughter?

33:59.279 --> 34:01.045
You didn't tell me
you had a daughter.

34:01.047 --> 34:02.280
What's your name,
sweetheart?

34:02.282 --> 34:03.548
Fuck off.

34:03.550 --> 34:04.949
I need to know
everything you do

34:04.951 --> 34:06.751
about how this trick
came to you, Jimmy.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.152
There's nothing to tell.

34:08.154 --> 34:09.987
I mean, I just...
You know, even a blind squirrel

34:09.989 --> 34:11.489
finds a nut
once in a while, right?

34:11.491 --> 34:12.771
Try again.

34:15.128 --> 34:16.561
I got a guy
at the courthouse.

34:16.563 --> 34:18.129
Okay?
He calls me up.

34:18.130 --> 34:19.931
He says there's some cash
laying around, easy grab.

34:19.933 --> 34:23.467
I call you. Beginning, middle, end.
Just like always.

34:23.469 --> 34:27.103
You know goddamn well
that someone killed my buyers.

34:27.106 --> 34:29.806
Hey... I don't know shit.
And I have everybody looking at me.

34:29.809 --> 34:31.775
I don't know anything about this.
Now I'm looking at you.

34:31.777 --> 34:33.945
Okay, what do you want from me?
You don't know anything?

34:33.947 --> 34:35.780
No, I don't know anything about this.
I don't wanna know.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.581
I stay here.
You're making me nervous, Jimmy.

34:37.583 --> 34:39.150
I don't like you coming here.
That's why we use a phone.

34:39.152 --> 34:40.650
Don't tell me you don't
fucking know the buyers.

34:40.652 --> 34:42.453
I don't know anything.
What do you want me to do?

34:42.455 --> 34:44.322
I wanna fucking meet 'em!
You want me to call them?

34:44.324 --> 34:45.956
I wanna meet 'em!
It's a guy at the courthouse.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.458
I wanna meet your fucking contact.
Okay, fine...

34:47.460 --> 34:49.092
The guy who gave you the fucking job!
Fine, fine.

34:49.094 --> 34:50.795
I wanna meet him now,
and I wanna meet him today.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.996
Okay. Okay.

34:52.998 --> 34:54.699
Not a problem.

34:58.938 --> 35:00.171
Yeah.

35:00.173 --> 35:01.272
You okay?

35:01.274 --> 35:02.940
Jimmy Lincoln.

35:02.942 --> 35:04.575
Great. Thanks.

35:18.958 --> 35:21.078
What do they call those,
skinny jeans?

35:24.197 --> 35:26.030
How old are you,
little darling?

35:26.032 --> 35:27.598
Sixteen, douchebag.

35:31.137 --> 35:33.418
You know, age of consent
is 16 in Georgia.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.374
I mean, not for me,
I'm just saying.

35:36.376 --> 35:37.808
They're active at this age.

35:37.810 --> 35:39.644
And when they use
language like that,

35:39.646 --> 35:42.126
you really have to question
some of the parenting choices made.

35:44.050 --> 35:46.183
All right, see the parking
garage up there?

35:46.185 --> 35:48.019
That's where we want to go.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.320
Just pull right in.

36:19.352 --> 36:21.452
Nick!

36:25.191 --> 36:27.058
Oh, my God!

36:50.450 --> 36:51.482
Oh, God.

37:17.744 --> 37:18.909
Let's go.

37:35.361 --> 37:38.429
<i>WIXP News. Top of the hour.</i>

37:38.431 --> 37:40.498
<i>Still not much movement
being reported</i>

37:40.500 --> 37:42.833
<i>in the Fulton County
armored car heist.</i>

37:42.835 --> 37:45.503
<i>The money taken from the evidence
locker is yet to be recovered,</i>

37:45.505 --> 37:47.505
<i>and no suspects
have been named.</i>

37:47.507 --> 37:49.340
Hey, kid.
You land somewhere?

37:49.342 --> 37:51.375
<i>Listen to me, Harp.
I killed a fucking cop.</i>

37:51.377 --> 37:53.310
A detective.
The guy was waiting to kill me.

37:53.312 --> 37:56.280
Jesus Christ.
You get a name?

37:56.282 --> 37:57.815
Detective Dinardi.

37:57.817 --> 38:01.185
Well, let me see
what I can dig up on him.

38:01.187 --> 38:03.020
What the hell am I
in the middle of here?

38:03.022 --> 38:06.157
<i>I don't know,
but it's all over the TV.</i>

38:06.159 --> 38:08.192
<i>The local news was reporting</i>

38:08.194 --> 38:10.494
<i>that the money from the heist
was crucial evidence</i>

38:10.496 --> 38:14.298
<i>in a case to indict a crew
of unnamed dirty cops.</i>

38:14.300 --> 38:17.468
<i>But since Alejandro
conveniently stole it,</i>

38:17.470 --> 38:19.503
<i>the DA now has no case
and is forced</i>

38:19.505 --> 38:21.505
<i>to drop the charges
against the officers.</i>

38:21.507 --> 38:24.575
<i>...reporting live from
the Fulton County Courthouse.</i>

38:24.577 --> 38:28.079
<i>All I can do now is wait
for Harper to dig something up.</i>

38:28.081 --> 38:31.749
Listen, do I have cops
looking for me now, too?

38:31.751 --> 38:33.918
I'll work on this.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.054
<i>Be smart. Stay low.</i>

39:45.391 --> 39:46.391
No, no.

39:55.401 --> 39:56.801
No.

40:13.452 --> 40:15.386
Marco...

40:36.943 --> 40:39.276
Hold on.

40:39.278 --> 40:41.545
Hold on. Hold on.

40:52.124 --> 40:55.125
Hey, the bathroom's a mess.
No, it's not.

40:55.127 --> 40:56.794
Yeah, the bathroom's a mess.
Can you clean it up?

40:56.796 --> 40:58.295
That is clean.

40:58.297 --> 41:00.464
Well, you gotta at least
do something with the bras.

41:00.466 --> 41:03.567
What, you've never seen a bra before?
This is different.

41:03.569 --> 41:05.803
Different how?
Different in that they're yours.

41:05.805 --> 41:07.504
Oh, you're embarrassed.

41:07.506 --> 41:10.207
I'm not embarrassed.

41:10.209 --> 41:12.209
You know I'm not a virgin.

41:12.211 --> 41:14.478
Oh, Cate, seriously?
Can I just take a shower?

41:14.480 --> 41:16.847
I did it in Mom's bed.
I was totally fine with it.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.048
I mean, it was...
Eric Griffin?

41:18.050 --> 41:19.650
What?

41:19.652 --> 41:21.385
The guy, Eric Griffin?

41:21.387 --> 41:23.220
You didn't
sleep with him, Cate.

41:23.222 --> 41:25.389
You were lonely, and you were pissed,
and I don't blame you.

41:25.391 --> 41:27.091
But you didn't sleep with him.

41:27.093 --> 41:30.594
How do you...

41:30.596 --> 41:33.036
You didn't talk...
Did you talk to him?

41:34.200 --> 41:36.200
Did you talk to him?
I liked him.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.701
Well, you could've
done better.

41:37.703 --> 41:38.869
What?

41:38.871 --> 41:40.337
You could've
done better, Cate.

41:40.339 --> 41:41.872
The guy was an asshole.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.208
You sold yourself short,
and you shouldn't, ever.

41:44.210 --> 41:47.211
Oh, so now you're giving life advice?
You're a thief.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.947
Can we just work on the bathroom right now?
No. No, no. Let's go.

41:49.949 --> 41:52.082
Let's go. Let's hear it.
Enlighten me.

41:52.084 --> 41:54.718
Okay. Blackjack.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.755
If you can get the house
to agree to stand on a soft 17,

41:57.757 --> 42:00.591
you can whittle their odds
down by .21 percent.

42:00.593 --> 42:03.394
What? You should know how
to change a car tire.

42:03.396 --> 42:05.329
Wouldn't hurt you
to learn the infield fly rule.

42:06.866 --> 42:09.667
And don't ever wear suede.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.424
Who intercepted the call?

42:33.426 --> 42:34.792
I did.

42:34.794 --> 42:37.594
It was our girl in Dispatch.
We're good.

42:37.596 --> 42:40.130
I'm telling you, I.A.'s
looking over my shoulder.

42:40.132 --> 42:42.833
And guys in our crew
disappearing ain't helping.

42:42.835 --> 42:45.736
This guy's gotta
be dealt with, Cap.

42:45.738 --> 42:48.105
The longer he runs,
the more dots he connects.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.574
The DA can't prosecute
without evidence.

42:50.576 --> 42:52.843
And thanks to Alejandro Vasquez
stealing it,

42:52.845 --> 42:54.611
they no longer have any.

42:54.613 --> 42:57.014
No one can connect us
to any of this.

42:57.016 --> 42:58.983
Nick Barrow can.

43:00.686 --> 43:02.920
Understand this:

43:02.922 --> 43:05.155
each one of you made a decision
to be standing here

43:05.157 --> 43:08.692
the day you decided to reach under
the table and take the money.

43:08.694 --> 43:11.195
He's fighting.

43:11.197 --> 43:12.763
And you don't fight this hard

43:12.765 --> 43:15.132
unless you have
a good goddamn reason.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.867
Find it!

43:16.869 --> 43:18.869
And get rid of the bodies.

43:21.173 --> 43:24.375
Fuck, man.
I knew it.

43:24.377 --> 43:26.677
Just fucking relax.

43:34.520 --> 43:35.786
Oh.

43:35.788 --> 43:37.755
You eat like shit.

43:50.302 --> 43:52.803
Coffee?

43:52.805 --> 43:55.372
At your age, you should
be taking a vitamin.

43:55.374 --> 43:58.242
Coffee is my vitamin.
Well, caffeine's not good for you.

43:58.244 --> 44:01.745
Guys trying to kill you isn't good for you.
Caffeine is fine.

44:01.747 --> 44:03.847
What else you got?

44:03.849 --> 44:06.784
No, no. Look. Here.

44:15.928 --> 44:18.662
Well, we're on the run, right?

44:25.838 --> 44:27.938
Okay, Cate.

44:27.940 --> 44:30.040
A wig, an outfit...

44:30.042 --> 44:32.209
It's only gonna attract
attention that we don't want.

44:32.211 --> 44:33.744
You want to go somewhere?

44:33.746 --> 44:35.879
Try and dress like the people
that are gonna be there.

44:35.881 --> 44:38.415
You go to a Brave's game,
you wear a Brave's jersey.

44:38.417 --> 44:41.218
You go to a tractor pull,
wear flannels and jeans.

44:41.220 --> 44:42.853
Try not to look
anybody in the eye.

44:42.855 --> 44:44.421
If everyone turns
to look at something,

44:44.423 --> 44:46.056
you turn and you look
at the same thing.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.791
Everyone's moving,
you keep moving.

44:47.793 --> 44:49.860
Make it like you're
on your way somewhere...

44:49.862 --> 44:51.428
that you know
where you're going.

44:51.430 --> 44:53.931
You don't do anything
to draw attention to yourself.

44:53.933 --> 44:57.568
We just have to keep low
and remember the rule of two.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.136
"Rule of two"?

44:59.138 --> 45:02.106
It takes a person two encounters
to recognize a stranger.

45:02.108 --> 45:03.540
The first time,
you're just a face.

45:03.542 --> 45:05.576
The second time,
something sticks.

45:05.578 --> 45:08.278
They may not know why,
but something lingers.

45:08.280 --> 45:10.781
And then, you're somewhere
you don't want to be.

45:10.783 --> 45:12.616
Which is where?

45:12.618 --> 45:14.551
In their head.

45:14.553 --> 45:16.887
Huh.

45:38.410 --> 45:40.077
<i>What do you got?</i>

45:40.079 --> 45:41.778
You ain't gonna like it.
<i>Then lie to me.</i>

45:41.780 --> 45:44.781
Well, stock market's up,
you won the lottery,

45:44.783 --> 45:46.950
and there's a model here
asking for your number.

45:46.952 --> 45:48.919
Runway or like,
<i>Sports Illustrated?</i>

45:48.921 --> 45:51.255
Hand.
Ah.

45:51.257 --> 45:54.358
The cop you killed... Dinardi...
was running with a pretty nasty crew.

45:54.360 --> 45:57.194
<i>Their CO, Joe Keenan,
a 20-year vet...</i>

45:57.196 --> 46:00.797
he's been there, and he's done that
twice over, and none of it's too good.

46:00.799 --> 46:03.467
<i>Turns out Keenan
wasn't always bad.</i>

46:03.469 --> 46:05.469
<i>He worked undercover so long,</i>

46:05.471 --> 46:08.305
<i>he became the very thing
he was trying to fight.</i>

46:08.307 --> 46:10.674
<i>And once your hands are dirty,</i>

46:10.676 --> 46:13.010
<i>it's hard
to ever get them clean.</i>

46:13.012 --> 46:15.679
<i>Even though this crew's
been under a lot of suspicion,</i>

46:15.681 --> 46:19.716
<i>everyone's innocent until
proven guilty, especially cops.</i>

46:19.718 --> 46:21.985
<i>And with the evidence
against them gone,</i>

46:21.987 --> 46:24.288
<i>Internal Affairs
has as little proof as I do</i>

46:24.290 --> 46:26.123
<i>that Keenan framed me.</i>

46:26.125 --> 46:27.891
<i>But I know one thing:</i>

46:27.893 --> 46:30.727
<i>guys like this get used
to things going their way.</i>

46:30.729 --> 46:34.131
<i>And I'm sure they didn't
count on me staying alive.</i>

46:34.133 --> 46:36.033
<i>The longer they can't find me,</i>

46:36.035 --> 46:37.901
<i>the more they'll start
to unravel.</i>

46:37.903 --> 46:40.404
Did my name hit the wire?
<i>No.</i>

46:40.406 --> 46:43.373
They're trying to keep it quiet,
take care of it themselves.

46:43.375 --> 46:45.375
I'm thinking about
getting out of here.

46:45.377 --> 46:47.578
Maybe making a run up north
over the border.

46:47.580 --> 46:48.912
No, you stay put.

46:48.914 --> 46:51.048
Vasquez would expect you
to make a dash.

46:51.050 --> 46:52.883
He'll have guys
looking for you everywhere.

46:52.885 --> 46:54.551
You're good there.
You stay there.

46:54.553 --> 46:56.553
All right.

47:00.259 --> 47:03.260
Let me ask you this.
What kind of stuff do you steal?

47:06.765 --> 47:08.765
Anything that's worth it.

47:08.767 --> 47:10.667
You ever been caught?

47:10.669 --> 47:12.269
Well, I don't actually
steal the stuff.

47:12.271 --> 47:14.004
I just plan the heist,

47:14.006 --> 47:16.406
and then I sell it to whoever
wants to take the risk.

47:16.408 --> 47:18.542
How much
do you sell them for?

47:18.544 --> 47:20.510
Depends on the trick.

47:22.514 --> 47:24.514
Are you rich?

47:24.516 --> 47:27.284
Well, most of the tricks
I peddle don't pan out.

47:27.286 --> 47:29.920
I got two bookies
on speed dial

47:29.922 --> 47:32.055
and a semi-professional
gambling problem.

47:32.057 --> 47:34.391
So why do it?

47:34.393 --> 47:36.793
Only thing I'm good at.

47:36.795 --> 47:41.565
So, how do you figure out how
to steal the stuff you steal?

47:41.567 --> 47:43.533
How do you write a song?

47:46.905 --> 47:48.872
Show me.

47:55.114 --> 47:58.282
You want me to tell you
how to knock off the bakery?

47:58.284 --> 48:00.317
Yeah. Why not?

48:02.988 --> 48:06.056
Number one: you have to know how
to get out before you get in.

48:06.058 --> 48:07.658
That's most important.

48:07.660 --> 48:09.559
And number two?

48:09.561 --> 48:13.130
You look, you wait,
you think.

48:13.132 --> 48:14.965
Security comes first.

48:14.967 --> 48:18.135
Does the building
have CCTV's, alarm?

48:18.137 --> 48:20.837
If the alarm is tripped,
who's responding?

48:20.839 --> 48:23.307
Private security?
Local police?

48:23.309 --> 48:25.142
Or is the owner
getting a courtesy call

48:25.144 --> 48:28.178
and has to motivate himself
to get out of bed?

48:28.180 --> 48:29.913
Just for a bakery?

48:29.915 --> 48:32.115
A bakery, a bank,
business.

48:32.117 --> 48:34.117
A job's a job.

48:34.119 --> 48:35.585
Now, there's six stores.

48:35.587 --> 48:38.322
The sight lines
are the front of our target.

48:38.324 --> 48:40.157
Up there, there's what?

48:40.159 --> 48:41.858
Three apartments?

48:41.860 --> 48:43.627
They vacant?

48:43.629 --> 48:45.595
They occupied?

48:49.335 --> 48:51.034
Then there's the exit plan.

48:51.036 --> 48:53.203
Are you walking out
or you driving out?

48:53.205 --> 48:55.205
Driving.
You need a driver.

48:55.207 --> 48:57.140
Can you trust him?
Or her?

48:57.142 --> 48:59.142
Is he any good?

48:59.144 --> 49:01.144
Will he show up?

49:01.146 --> 49:04.448
Okay, I'll walk.
Which way you walking?

49:04.450 --> 49:07.184
I don't know. That way?
The bank?

49:07.186 --> 49:10.587
What about it?
There's an ATM.

49:13.992 --> 49:16.293
Means it has a camera.

49:20.399 --> 49:23.333
Okay, I'll go the other way.
The B&B?

49:23.335 --> 49:27.304
'Cause there's people
coming and going at off hours.

49:27.306 --> 49:29.139
A young girl carrying
a few dozen bear claws

49:29.141 --> 49:31.661
is gonna draw
some interest.

49:50.028 --> 49:52.596
Matty, you have to
pull yourself together.

49:52.598 --> 49:54.498
I can't.

49:54.500 --> 49:57.200
I cannot do
the rest of my tour

49:57.202 --> 49:59.102
with I.A. looking over
my shoulder.

49:59.104 --> 50:01.037
Matty, suspicion
and conviction

50:01.039 --> 50:03.373
live on opposite sides
of town.

50:03.375 --> 50:05.876
This is what we do.

50:05.878 --> 50:08.912
It got messy.
We cleaned it up.

50:10.082 --> 50:12.749
I just...
I just want out.

50:12.751 --> 50:16.720
There's no out.
This is the ride.

50:16.722 --> 50:21.625
We've got a year, maybe two,
till we hand in our stars.

50:21.627 --> 50:24.294
Our pension's in sight.

50:24.296 --> 50:27.297
And it has never been
this hot, ever.

50:27.299 --> 50:31.201
We take money from scumbags
and lowlifes.

50:31.203 --> 50:34.104
Anyone we shake down
has it coming.

50:36.975 --> 50:39.843
I just...
I just want out.

50:51.423 --> 50:53.657
Happy birthday.

50:53.659 --> 50:56.460
My birthday's in August.
I missed a few.

50:56.462 --> 50:59.830
I... I can't... What...
What is this?

50:59.832 --> 51:02.365
It's a pony.
What do you think it is?

51:19.418 --> 51:20.817
Thanks.

51:20.819 --> 51:22.652
Come on.
We're going out.

51:22.654 --> 51:24.955
Really? Where?

51:24.957 --> 51:27.424
Surprise.

51:35.534 --> 51:40.670

Make a square.

52:06.331 --> 52:09.799
Look at my middle finger.
Right here, the one I'm holding up.

52:09.801 --> 52:11.735
Yeah? Now pull it back
towards your eyes.

52:11.737 --> 52:13.803
Don't even think
about it. Go!

52:13.805 --> 52:15.338
That means you're
left-eye dominant.

52:15.340 --> 52:17.240
That means you close
your right eye when you shoot.

52:17.242 --> 52:19.342
There's a couple universal rules
when you're handling a weapon.

52:19.344 --> 52:21.511
Number one is, you don't
point the weapon at anything

52:21.513 --> 52:23.079
unless you're
prepared to shoot.

52:23.081 --> 52:25.081
Wanna hold your...
Keep your thumbs relaxed.

52:25.083 --> 52:27.317
You want to put it right over
the front sighting.

52:27.319 --> 52:30.353
Then, when you pull the trigger,
just the same steady pressure.

52:30.355 --> 52:31.988
Go.

52:31.990 --> 52:34.257

52:47.506 --> 52:49.573
Your very own...
I hit the balloon.

52:49.575 --> 52:53.777
...little pink, uh...
He just wants a toy that I hit!

52:53.779 --> 52:56.279
Mommy, it's okay.
Just zip it, okay?

52:56.281 --> 52:58.415
Look, you just can't
let people walk all...

52:58.417 --> 53:00.116
You know,
this is bullshit.

53:00.118 --> 53:02.552
Look, lady,
it's called Pop the Balloon.

53:02.554 --> 53:04.955
You want something...
Stay here.

53:04.957 --> 53:07.123
...then pop the fucking balloon.
Don't fuck...

53:07.125 --> 53:10.193
Don't curse
in front of my child.

53:10.195 --> 53:12.028
Look at that.

53:12.030 --> 53:13.563
Magic.
Here you go.

53:13.565 --> 53:16.299
Whoa. What is this?

53:16.301 --> 53:18.935
Are you charity night
at the fair?

53:20.439 --> 53:22.606
I'm just trying to help.
Help?

53:22.608 --> 53:25.375
Help with what?
I don't need you...

53:25.377 --> 53:28.645
You know what?
My kid, my business, okay?

53:28.647 --> 53:32.248
Jenny...
is everything okay?

53:32.250 --> 53:36.786
No. This a-hole is trying
to steal my cash,

53:36.788 --> 53:40.156
and this one is sticking his face
where it doesn't belong.

53:41.426 --> 53:43.426
I think I have it
from here, sir.

53:43.428 --> 53:45.295
Appreciate it.
Here you go.

53:45.297 --> 53:47.163
Thank you.

53:47.165 --> 53:51.501
Yeah! Whoo!

53:51.503 --> 53:53.870
Whoo!

54:20.499 --> 54:24.100
When all of this is over,
I want to leave and go on a trip with you.

54:25.137 --> 54:26.770
Where would we go?

54:26.772 --> 54:29.706
I don't know.

54:29.708 --> 54:32.108
Your beach.
From the photos.

54:32.110 --> 54:33.877
What about your mom?

54:33.879 --> 54:36.212
You still like her.

54:36.214 --> 54:38.048
Cate...
How did you guys meet?

54:38.050 --> 54:40.216
Your mom?

54:42.320 --> 54:46.022
She was, uh, young,
and she was with a dance company.

54:46.024 --> 54:49.459
And, uh, she was
pretty opinionated.

54:49.461 --> 54:52.629
Gave me, uh...
Gave me a hard time most of the time.

54:52.631 --> 54:56.633
I don't know.
She made me laugh, I guess.

54:56.635 --> 54:59.402
Well, then you came along.

55:07.145 --> 55:09.345
We should take a picture
while we're still at the top.

55:09.347 --> 55:11.414
Okay. That's a good idea.

55:12.417 --> 55:14.784
All right. You ready?
Yep.

55:16.388 --> 55:19.155
Ready?
One, two, three.

56:04.102 --> 56:06.302
Hello, Matty.

56:06.304 --> 56:08.138
Jesus!

56:09.541 --> 56:11.207
Christ, Cap.

56:11.209 --> 56:13.449
What are you doing
with I.A.?

56:14.579 --> 56:16.546
What are you
talking about?

56:18.250 --> 56:20.083
I didn't speak to them.

56:20.085 --> 56:22.619
I got pictures.

56:22.621 --> 56:25.922
You're as dirty
as me, pal.

56:25.924 --> 56:31.027
Question is, what the hell
could you have that they want?

56:41.807 --> 56:45.675
You've been thinking about making a deal,
haven't you, Matty?

56:45.677 --> 56:46.709
I didn't say nothing.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.114
They wanted to talk.
I didn't...

56:58.490 --> 57:01.224
Fu... Fuck you!

57:05.497 --> 57:07.931
I got him here,
just like you said.

57:10.335 --> 57:13.837
I did good, right?
That you did.

57:25.016 --> 57:27.450
This is Detective Keenan.

57:27.452 --> 57:29.052
Shots fired,
officer down.

57:29.054 --> 57:31.521
Repeat: shots fired,
officer down.

57:31.523 --> 57:35.158
Signal 50 and 48.
Send the fucking E.M.s now!

57:35.160 --> 57:38.161
<i>Where you at, Detective?</i>
Blue Bird Motel, Glenwood and Avery.

57:38.163 --> 57:41.497
Oh, geez! Hurry!
<i>Roger. Signal 50 and 48.</i>

57:41.499 --> 57:44.067
<i>E.M.s on the way.
Can you identify the suspect?</i>

57:44.069 --> 57:46.069
Nick Barrow.

58:00.986 --> 58:03.546
You're gonna get us
out of this, right?

58:05.824 --> 58:07.757
Yeah.

58:07.759 --> 58:09.759
I am.

58:14.399 --> 58:17.567
<i>He killed a cop!</i>

58:17.569 --> 58:19.836
Are you sure?

58:19.838 --> 58:22.338
I'm holding the fucking APB
in my hand.

58:22.340 --> 58:25.708
I... I don't know that there's
anything else I can do for you now.

58:25.710 --> 58:29.112
There's nothing else
you can do, Oscar?

58:29.114 --> 58:32.415
You better hope
that's not the case, my friend.

58:40.959 --> 58:42.959
Chief?

58:42.961 --> 58:45.295
Chief, let's go!
Mm...

58:45.297 --> 58:48.298
Rise and shine.
Time to fight bad guys.

58:50.468 --> 58:51.935
Morning.
Mm-hmm.

59:08.086 --> 59:10.987
How can you say that?
The Sex Pistols were a great band.

59:10.989 --> 59:13.309
No, they were
a great <i> bad</i> band.

59:22.067 --> 59:24.467
Cate, something's happened.

59:24.469 --> 59:26.302
What?

59:26.304 --> 59:28.805
Pack your stuff now.
Why?

59:28.807 --> 59:31.007
Because they found us.
Wait.

59:31.009 --> 59:33.776
I thought you said no one knew
where we were. Cate, I'm serious.

59:33.778 --> 59:37.178
- Come on. Grab your bag.
- We gotta go.

59:37.415 --> 59:39.582
Nick. Nick.

59:43.288 --> 59:46.723
It's okay, Cate.
I got a plan.

59:48.326 --> 59:51.194
I need you to do
exactly what I say.

59:51.196 --> 59:53.596
We need something to separate
the sheriff and the deputy.

59:55.300 --> 59:58.420
Then we can meet at the
rendezvous point in ten minutes.

01:00:03.942 --> 01:00:07.276
- Put your hands up.
- Don't move!

01:00:13.051 --> 01:00:15.151
If something goes wrong,

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:18.287
no matter what happens,
get out of town and do not come back.

01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:20.089
This is non-negotiable.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:46.930
Get out the way!

01:00:51.056 --> 01:00:53.589
Coming through!

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.804
Freeze!

01:02:02.494 --> 01:02:04.193
Come on, Cate.

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:17.740
Out!

01:02:19.577 --> 01:02:21.878
Out of the car right now!

01:02:30.688 --> 01:02:32.922
Get down.

01:02:43.101 --> 01:02:44.667
Don't move!

01:02:44.669 --> 01:02:46.836
Oh, I got your ass now.

01:02:46.838 --> 01:02:48.104
Try and run again.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:54.911
Put your hands up
and get on your knees.

01:02:57.182 --> 01:02:59.515
Lay down!

01:03:06.024 --> 01:03:08.024
"Nicholas Barrow,
wanted for the murder

01:03:08.026 --> 01:03:10.893
of Detective Matthew Miller."

01:03:10.895 --> 01:03:12.528
Is this you?

01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:17.166
Do you believe
everything you read?

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:20.736
Yeah, when it has the words
"APB" on top of it, I do.

01:03:22.974 --> 01:03:25.041
Some people got killed,

01:03:25.043 --> 01:03:28.377
and the person who put me on
that APB thinks that I did it.

01:03:28.379 --> 01:03:32.582
And that's your story,
and you're sticking to that, huh?

01:03:32.584 --> 01:03:34.584
Hey, Sheriff,
will you listen to me?

01:03:34.586 --> 01:03:37.520
The guy that I'm running from
has connections everywhere.

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:40.156
That APB isn't real.
He's using you to track me down.

01:03:40.158 --> 01:03:42.391
Don't make that call!
Please don't make that call!

01:03:42.393 --> 01:03:44.393
I want you to sit down!

01:03:56.441 --> 01:03:59.041
A man lives his life,

01:03:59.043 --> 01:04:02.411
and everything he was
fits into a goddamn box.

01:04:04.048 --> 01:04:05.348
He say anything?

01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:06.849
What?

01:04:06.851 --> 01:04:08.851
Matty.

01:04:08.853 --> 01:04:11.187
Did he say anything
before he passed?

01:04:11.189 --> 01:04:14.123
He was pretty far gone.

01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:16.045
First Dinardi,
now Matty.

01:04:17.128 --> 01:04:19.295
You saw him, right?
I mean Barrow.

01:04:19.297 --> 01:04:22.131
You... You saw him?
Yeah, I saw him.

01:04:22.133 --> 01:04:24.200
What about it?
What went down?

01:04:24.202 --> 01:04:26.202
Why not put two in his head
right then and there?

01:04:26.204 --> 01:04:28.871
What do you want from me,
Darrell, huh?

01:04:28.873 --> 01:04:31.574
You want to hear me say
I fucked up? Fine, I fucked up!

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:34.977
All right? You happy? He got the jump
on me. Barrow got the jump on me.

01:04:34.979 --> 01:04:37.747
I had to make a decision.
Hey, Cap.

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:41.484
We got him. Call just came in from
a sheriff on the APB you put out.

01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:45.121
All right.
Let's do this.

01:05:03.741 --> 01:05:05.141
Boss, they're here.

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:16.452
I'm Detective Garcia,
the two-four.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:18.487
I'm looking
for Sheriff Braydon.

01:05:18.489 --> 01:05:21.490
- Right here.
- Sheriff, you have to listen to me.

01:05:21.492 --> 01:05:24.093
These guys aren't cops.

01:05:24.095 --> 01:05:26.929
Look like cops to me.
Sheriff, will you listen to me?

01:05:26.931 --> 01:05:29.031
He been like this
the whole time?

01:05:29.033 --> 01:05:30.866
Sheriff, these guys aren't...

01:05:39.677 --> 01:05:41.777
We good to go?

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:47.450
Yeah, as soon as we verify
your badge numbers.

01:05:56.627 --> 01:05:58.994
7138.

01:05:58.996 --> 01:06:00.896
7396.

01:06:00.898 --> 01:06:03.498
Call them in, Dean.
You got it.

01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:13.909
Zone nine. P.A.

01:06:13.911 --> 01:06:16.045
<i>Uh, Sheriff Braydon's office
up in Hastings.</i>

01:06:16.047 --> 01:06:18.247
<i>We're looking to confirm
two badge numbers</i>

01:06:18.249 --> 01:06:20.683
<i>relating to a transfer.</i>

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:23.185
Sure. Hold on.

01:06:32.163 --> 01:06:34.723
All right.
First one.

01:06:37.735 --> 01:06:39.568
Thank you.

01:06:44.008 --> 01:06:47.877
Sheriff! Sheriff,
these guys aren't cops!

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.979
Sheriff, please.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.194
Nick...

01:07:40.998 --> 01:07:44.934
I no longer care about you, Nick.

01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:46.669
You are dead.

01:07:48.172 --> 01:07:50.940
I'm gonna send you
to your grave,

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:55.344
and then I'm going to do
the same thing to your daughter.

01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:01.417
Hey. Uh, that was weird.

01:08:01.419 --> 01:08:02.651
What was weird?

01:08:02.653 --> 01:08:05.087
I just got a call
from A.P.D. C.I.

01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:06.789
A detective named Keenan.

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:09.124
He's 15 minutes out
to pick up his prisoner.

01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:10.993
What prisoner?
Barrow.

01:08:10.995 --> 01:08:12.695
Keenan's freaking out.

01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:17.099
He's never heard of anyone
named Detective Garcia, and...

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.935
Son of a bitch!

01:08:19.937 --> 01:08:23.072
Don't call anyone!
Get Dean!

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:27.390
How did you get me
on the APB?

01:08:29.212 --> 01:08:32.381
Are you sick enough
to kill a cop just to set me up?

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:36.218
I didn't kill any cop.

01:08:37.688 --> 01:08:39.688
Then how did you...

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:41.323
Shit!

01:09:09.921 --> 01:09:11.153
Dean!

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:21.930
Dean!

01:09:26.904 --> 01:09:28.304
Fuck!

01:09:46.424 --> 01:09:49.058
Where the fuck you at?

01:09:51.761 --> 01:09:52.761
Dean!

01:09:56.567 --> 01:10:00.035
Shut your ass up!

01:10:24.061 --> 01:10:26.095
You know how
to use that thing?

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:28.530
You want to find out?

01:10:30.234 --> 01:10:31.467
Put your hands up.

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.340
Give me the keys.

01:10:48.519 --> 01:10:50.019
Get down!

01:10:50.021 --> 01:10:51.687
Put your gun on him.

01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:59.161
Now it's my turn to talk.

01:10:59.163 --> 01:11:01.530
I didn't kill Alejandro,
Victor.

01:11:01.532 --> 01:11:03.832
I think the guy behind this
name is Keenan,

01:11:03.834 --> 01:11:05.668
and he's a cop.

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:08.270
How do I know you
weren't in on it?

01:11:08.272 --> 01:11:10.039
I've got nothing to hide.

01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:11.640
That's why I'm not
gonna kill you.

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:13.676
You're not gonna kill me
because if you do...

01:11:15.346 --> 01:11:17.513
this will never end.

01:11:17.515 --> 01:11:20.149
I'm gonna prove to you that
I had nothing to do with it.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:22.317
And then I'm gonna ask
for something in return.

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:24.053
Your word as a father

01:11:24.055 --> 01:11:27.222
that when you hear the truth,
that you leave Cate alone.

01:11:35.232 --> 01:11:38.133
I didn't kill Alejandro,
Victor.

01:11:42.973 --> 01:11:45.140
Go.

01:11:45.142 --> 01:11:47.142
Get down.

01:11:47.144 --> 01:11:48.877
Get down.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:54.883
Come on.

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:13.268
I told you this was
non-negotiable.

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:15.571
I just saved your life.
Okay?

01:12:15.573 --> 01:12:16.872
A thank you
would be nice.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.107
Well, don't do it again.

01:12:25.382 --> 01:12:27.750
I was trying to help you!
I don't need your help!

01:12:27.752 --> 01:12:29.184
Oh, you could
have fooled me.

01:12:29.186 --> 01:12:31.386
I can't do this if I
know you're in danger.

01:12:31.388 --> 01:12:33.789
And as long as you're with me...
You're starting to become...

01:12:33.791 --> 01:12:35.390
What? I'm starting
to become what?

01:12:35.392 --> 01:12:37.025
Too involved.
I want to be involved!

01:12:37.027 --> 01:12:38.861
What if you got hurt?
Everything I would have done

01:12:38.863 --> 01:12:41.530
would have meant nothing.
Everything you've done?

01:12:41.532 --> 01:12:43.932
Everything I've done
has been for you.

01:12:43.934 --> 01:12:45.734
The running!
The hiding!

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.803
All of it has been for you!
Damn it, Nick!

01:12:47.805 --> 01:12:49.538
I just want
to help you.

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.240
I don't need your help.

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:01.650
Cate. Open the... Cate!

01:13:04.822 --> 01:13:06.388
Cate!

01:13:16.734 --> 01:13:18.834
Run a print on this.

01:13:38.255 --> 01:13:40.823
Prints match the ones
that was taken off the keychain.

01:13:40.825 --> 01:13:43.091
She got busted with
a couple of friends.

01:13:43.093 --> 01:13:44.626
What did I tell you?

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:46.862
Who was arrested with her?
Who bailed her out?

01:13:46.864 --> 01:13:49.198
I want all the information.
All of it!

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.833
You got it, Cap.

01:14:18.295 --> 01:14:20.762
Becca, I'm at your place,
you need to call me.

01:14:43.254 --> 01:14:46.021
<i>This day could
not end soon enough.</i>

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:49.391
<i>I couldn't find Cate and my
window was closing with Victor.</i>

01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:54.429
<i>Matty's death just wasn't
sitting right with me.</i>

01:14:54.431 --> 01:14:56.531
<i>Would Keenan really
be desperate enough</i>

01:14:56.533 --> 01:14:59.201
<i>to kill his own men?
And if so, why?</i>

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:02.504
<i>I had Harper do some digging
into Matty's personal files.</i>

01:15:02.506 --> 01:15:05.841
<i>Turns out the guy was going
through a nasty divorce.</i>

01:15:07.344 --> 01:15:09.044
<i>But Miller was crafty.</i>

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:10.679
<i>He started a dummy corporation</i>

01:15:10.681 --> 01:15:12.814
<i>which had only one
hidden asset.</i>

01:15:13.918 --> 01:15:15.851
<i>A boat.</i>

01:15:15.853 --> 01:15:17.613
<i>Sounds like
a good place to start.</i>

01:15:54.758 --> 01:15:57.626
- Cate!
<i>- Not quite.</i>

01:15:57.628 --> 01:16:00.595
<i>Keenan.</i>
Very good, Nick.

01:16:00.597 --> 01:16:02.831
Let me talk to my daughter.

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:06.134
Nick, I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

01:16:06.136 --> 01:16:09.471
I'm gonna give you an address, and I
don't give a shit if you're in Timbuktu.

01:16:09.473 --> 01:16:11.506
You've got 15 minutes
to get there.

01:16:11.508 --> 01:16:14.776
Now you listen to me, you fuck.
If you harm her in any way

01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:16.345
<i>I promise, I'll...</i>
Nick, I need you to focus, okay?

01:16:16.347 --> 01:16:18.513
Otherwise you're not
gonna make it in time.

01:16:19.817 --> 01:16:22.417
I have your money.
What money?

01:16:22.419 --> 01:16:24.553
The money Matty Miller took.
I got it.

01:16:28.625 --> 01:16:31.994
Mechanicsville, south side
of the old brickworks.

01:16:31.996 --> 01:16:34.062
Come alone. No tricks.

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:19.975
Send her over, Keenan.

01:17:21.979 --> 01:17:23.812
And the money?

01:17:25.749 --> 01:17:28.050
Somewhere close.

01:17:28.052 --> 01:17:30.385
And that's where it stays
until I have my daughter.

01:17:30.387 --> 01:17:32.554
Then you've made
a critical error in judgment.

01:17:37.394 --> 01:17:39.127
Just like Matty Miller?

01:17:44.068 --> 01:17:46.001
What the fuck
is he talking about?

01:17:46.003 --> 01:17:47.836
He's talking shit.

01:17:47.838 --> 01:17:49.438
Only thing that
makes sense, Keenan.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.640
Internal affairs, right?

01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:58.180
Is that why you killed him?
He turned on you?

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:03.051
You killed Matty?

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:05.720
He was gonna give
the money over to I.A.

01:18:05.722 --> 01:18:08.723
He had you dead to rights.
He had all of you.

01:18:08.725 --> 01:18:10.425
You motherfucker!

01:18:10.427 --> 01:18:12.627
How does he know about
all this shit, Cap?

01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:14.429
Doesn't matter!

01:18:14.431 --> 01:18:16.698
If there's money floating
around, it's gonna take us down!

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.567
You gonna kill
everybody, Keenan?

01:18:18.569 --> 01:18:21.203
What the hell else you
ain't telling us, Cap? Nothing.

01:18:21.205 --> 01:18:23.872
I thought you said we were all
in the fucking clear, huh?

01:18:26.743 --> 01:18:28.944
Mosley!

01:18:43.794 --> 01:18:44.794
Ah!

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:47.796
Fuck!

01:19:05.782 --> 01:19:07.015
Fuck you, Keenan!

01:19:32.543 --> 01:19:34.075
This way.

01:19:58.368 --> 01:20:00.569
It's over now, right?

01:20:00.571 --> 01:20:02.304
Almost.

01:20:04.174 --> 01:20:05.574
Soon.

01:20:08.245 --> 01:20:10.078
You saved me.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.746
Yeah.

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:15.183
Well then, we're even.

01:20:21.091 --> 01:20:22.424
Now this could be tricky.

01:20:22.426 --> 01:20:24.492
And a lot more dangerous.

01:20:24.494 --> 01:20:26.027
We got the context.

01:20:26.029 --> 01:20:28.530
Keenan, Victor,
everyone we need.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:30.899
All right, here's the plan.

01:20:30.901 --> 01:20:32.267
We gotta spread
a little rumor...

01:20:32.269 --> 01:20:33.868
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:36.871
No. You do not
have any idea, okay?

01:20:36.873 --> 01:20:38.607
You are not getting
involved in this.

01:20:38.609 --> 01:20:40.275
Nick, you just
said it yourself...

01:20:40.277 --> 01:20:42.010
I am not getting in this
with you right now.

01:20:42.012 --> 01:20:44.512
We don't have a choice.
No way, Cate. No way.

01:20:46.683 --> 01:20:49.017
Now the next part of this can
get a little more difficult.

01:20:49.019 --> 01:20:51.519
We get through this
and the heat is off.

01:20:51.521 --> 01:20:53.421
Then you're done with this.
Clean slate.

01:20:59.529 --> 01:21:00.862
It's not about going
inside or outside.

01:21:00.864 --> 01:21:02.430
It's about being smart,

01:21:02.432 --> 01:21:04.799
not drawing attention
to yourself, blending in.

01:21:07.638 --> 01:21:10.205
You look.
You wait.

01:21:10.207 --> 01:21:11.606
You think.

01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:16.411
The sight lines are
the front of our target.

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:17.879
Then there's the exit plan.

01:21:17.881 --> 01:21:19.314
Are you walking out
or you driving out?

01:21:19.316 --> 01:21:20.882
Don't point the weapon
at anything

01:21:20.884 --> 01:21:22.684
unless you're
prepared to shoot.

01:22:44.968 --> 01:22:47.088
Detective Keenan!

01:22:50.307 --> 01:22:52.240
You gonna kill me?

01:22:52.242 --> 01:22:55.243
You know the best advice my
father ever gave me, Detective?

01:22:57.047 --> 01:23:00.682
Don't sell myself short.
Ever.

01:23:00.684 --> 01:23:03.518
Killing's the easy part.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.987
Getting away with it.
That's the trick.

01:23:05.989 --> 01:23:08.890
You have two neighbors.

01:23:08.892 --> 01:23:10.892
One is away for
another two weeks.

01:23:10.894 --> 01:23:12.560
The other couple is home.

01:23:12.562 --> 01:23:15.830
The lady's at least 75.
Her husband's older.

01:23:15.832 --> 01:23:18.833
It's now 10:20.
She's been asleep for two hours.

01:23:18.835 --> 01:23:22.237
He's parked in front of the TV
watching the Braves, hearing aid out.

01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:24.520
And then, of course,
there's this.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:26.574
You're a drinker.

01:23:26.576 --> 01:23:28.042
Now, it might take a lot,

01:23:28.044 --> 01:23:30.111
and you might hide it well,
but I know.

01:23:30.113 --> 01:23:33.548
How many times have you come out
here and waved your gun around?

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.984
Or yelled at some kids for
hitting a ball into your yard?

01:23:38.755 --> 01:23:41.122
I think I can
get away with it.

01:23:41.124 --> 01:23:43.358
You just made
a pretty good case

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.360
of why I could
kill you, too.

01:23:45.362 --> 01:23:47.295
Answer this.

01:23:47.297 --> 01:23:48.930
Why my dad?

01:23:48.932 --> 01:23:51.332
Your dad fills a lot
of holes, sweetheart.

01:23:52.803 --> 01:23:54.636
Gave Victor Vasquez
someone to blame

01:23:54.638 --> 01:23:57.539
for his son's murder so he
could move on with his life.

01:23:59.476 --> 01:24:01.609
You know, there was only one thing

01:24:01.611 --> 01:24:04.145
that could put me in jail,
and you saved me the trouble of having

01:24:04.147 --> 01:24:06.114
to go look for it
by bringing it right to me

01:24:06.116 --> 01:24:08.349
and putting it
in my refrigerator.

01:24:13.623 --> 01:24:15.457
Go home, kid.

01:24:32.442 --> 01:24:34.709
What was it you said,
Detective?

01:24:38.248 --> 01:24:42.984
I need to move on
with my life? Hm?

01:24:45.856 --> 01:24:48.089
Well, guess what?

01:24:48.091 --> 01:24:50.592
I'm not ready.

01:25:16.119 --> 01:25:18.887
What are you gonna
do to him?

01:25:18.889 --> 01:25:21.689
Nothing good.

01:25:30.367 --> 01:25:33.801
<i>"D.A. recovered stolen
evidence money.</i>

01:25:33.803 --> 01:25:35.670
<i>Detective Keenan's
still missing,</i>

01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:39.073
<i>wanted for multiple murders
within the Atlanta PD.</i>

01:25:39.075 --> 01:25:43.144
In light of these developments,
original suspect Nick Barrow

01:25:43.146 --> 01:25:46.814
has been exonerated
of all charges."

01:25:46.816 --> 01:25:49.717
Looks like I won't be
collecting that insurance money.

01:25:49.719 --> 01:25:53.588
No. I think you
got a better payout.

01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:55.857
You're right.
Appreciate it, Harp.

01:25:55.859 --> 01:25:57.659
Get out of here, kid.

01:25:57.661 --> 01:26:00.895
Well, it looks like
my plan worked out pretty well.

01:26:00.897 --> 01:26:04.432
Yeah. I was closer
than you think.

01:26:04.434 --> 01:26:06.534
Old habits die hard.

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:09.504
<i>Lucy and I finally spoke,</i>

01:26:09.506 --> 01:26:12.440
<i>and were able to agree
on one thing.</i>

01:26:12.442 --> 01:26:13.908
<i>Going forward,
it would be best for her</i>

01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:15.543
<i>to focus on getting better.</i>

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:19.080
<i>If she needed anything,
we'd be there for her.</i>

01:26:19.082 --> 01:26:21.583
<i>Lucy also thought that
the best thing for Cate</i>

01:26:21.585 --> 01:26:23.685
<i>was to live with me.</i>

01:26:23.687 --> 01:26:26.020
<i>I agreed.</i>

01:26:26.022 --> 01:26:28.690
<i>I guess maybe I was more ready
to be a dad than I realized.</i>

01:26:28.692 --> 01:26:30.091
Do you think...

01:26:30.093 --> 01:26:32.360
that when we're
back in town

01:26:32.362 --> 01:26:33.795
I'll be seeing
a lot of you?

01:26:35.265 --> 01:26:37.532
Will you be seeing
a lot of me?

01:26:37.534 --> 01:26:39.767
Well, let's see.

01:26:39.769 --> 01:26:42.937
I do live in
an apartment by myself.

01:26:42.939 --> 01:26:44.806
I was thinking about
getting a fish.

01:26:45.976 --> 01:26:48.943
Yeah, you'll be
seeing a lot of me.

01:26:48.945 --> 01:26:51.813
Okay, good, because there's
this place I do my recitals.

01:26:51.815 --> 01:26:53.381
And they're closed
every Sunday.

01:26:53.383 --> 01:26:55.149
What are you
talking about?

01:26:55.151 --> 01:26:57.418
Most people pay cash
so the cash register's

01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:00.321
gotta be completely full,
and I already have a good out.

01:27:00.323 --> 01:27:02.156
Okay, the place next to it?
Went out of business.

01:27:02.158 --> 01:27:03.825
They're completely vacant.
No one's in the area.

01:27:03.827 --> 01:27:05.593
I could get in and out
of there so quickly.

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:07.829
Okay, let's just take it one
step at a time here, please.

01:27:07.831 --> 01:27:09.897
Focus on graduating
high school.

01:27:09.899 --> 01:27:11.399
I'm just saying.

01:27:11.401 --> 01:27:12.834
Uh-huh.

01:27:12.836 --> 01:27:15.637
I have something
for you.

01:27:15.639 --> 01:27:17.372
What is it?

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:22.210
Well, I... I know you
have a bunch of just me.

01:27:23.913 --> 01:27:26.347
I thought maybe you'd
like one with both of us.

01:27:29.185 --> 01:27:32.520
I love it.
