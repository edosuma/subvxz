38:39.275 --> 38:41.903
He's the one I fell in love with.

38:42.529 --> 38:44.327
Fight for him.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.639
Does anyone else want to share?

39:07.262 --> 39:09.139
My name's Ryan, I'm an alcoholic.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.773
ALL:
Hi, Ryan.

39:10.932 --> 39:13.435
It's been a while since my last meeting.

39:13.601 --> 39:19.074
Uh, I had over 18 months of sobriety,
but I started drinking again.

39:20.817 --> 39:26.369
And I've hurt the people that I love, uh,
driven them away...

39:26.531 --> 39:32.789
...because I didn't think I deserved them.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.217
But I want to change.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.052
I need to change.

39:40.712 --> 39:45.809
And I wanna be the man
who deserves the woman in his life...

39:45.967 --> 39:50.393
...who deserves his family and his friends.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.068
I wanna be better.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.689
I will be better.

40:16.372 --> 40:18.090
So where did you park?

40:18.249 --> 40:19.751
Right here in this garage.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.511
I'll walk you.

40:22.003 --> 40:24.597
- You're such a gentleman.
- Ha, ha. Not really.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.100
I'm scared to walk alone.
I figure you'll protect me.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.384
[CHUCKLES]

40:30.803 --> 40:32.976
You remember the first time that we met?

40:33.139 --> 40:35.437
- When you threatened me?
- Ha, ha.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.853
Yeah, accused me of endangering Ryan?

40:38.019 --> 40:40.317
Yeah, that's the one.

40:41.731 --> 40:43.654
Know what I thought when I first saw you?

40:44.275 --> 40:46.198
That I was foxy?

40:46.611 --> 40:48.909
- Ha, ha.
- Clearly.

40:50.573 --> 40:53.918
That Ryan was lucky to have someone
that cared that much about him.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.663
Had his back, no matter what.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.836
Guess I wanted to inspire
that kind of passion.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.714
You did.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.088
You still do.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.300
I never should have left you, Max.

41:11.928 --> 41:14.056
You're the love of my life.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.892
Heh.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.625
So you wanna come over?

41:34.784 --> 41:36.707
- Yeah. Um...
- Yeah.

41:37.578 --> 41:38.670
I gotta get my car.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.082
Yeah.

41:41.249 --> 41:43.047
[CHUCKLES]

41:54.470 --> 41:56.393
Kiss me again.

42:06.149 --> 42:07.696
Mike!

42:08.151 --> 42:09.494
No!

42:09.902 --> 42:11.620
[BOTH GRUNTING AND MAX SCREAMING]

42:20.329 --> 42:22.457
[GUNSHOTS]

42:31.632 --> 42:33.805
Mike. Mike. Mike.

42:34.844 --> 42:36.562
Oh, God.

42:40.308 --> 42:41.810
Officer down. Officer down.

42:41.976 --> 42:46.072
I need an ambulance at the garage
at 58th and 10th. Oh, God.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.153
Hey. Hey, hang on. Hang on, hang on.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.450
Oh, my God.

42:50.860 --> 42:53.579
You're gonna be all right. Hang on, Mike.
