WEBVTT

00:11.888 --> 00:13.719
( laughing )

00:13.806 --> 00:15.467
Outstanding.

00:15.558 --> 00:19.016
Believe it or not, I'm actually
getting better at controlling
this thing.

00:19.103 --> 00:21.185
How'd you say you
figured this out?

00:21.272 --> 00:24.639
Well, much trial and
error, actually.

00:24.734 --> 00:26.270
Yeah, it's impressive.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.397
Well, I haven't had
much else to do.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.616
Takes time to learn to fly.
I know you've been
practicing on the ground...

00:32.700 --> 00:34.361
D'Argo:
No... what... hang on!

00:35.536 --> 00:37.401
( breathing heavily)

00:38.289 --> 00:39.529
D'Argo:
How many times?

00:39.624 --> 00:41.489
Crichton:
One. Once. Uno.

00:41.584 --> 00:43.415
You had to touch something!

00:43.502 --> 00:46.084
D'Argo, I didn't touch anything.
-How many times did I ask you?!

00:46.172 --> 00:49.335
I said, "Do not go
inside the ship!"
-I needed the presnot calibrator.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.632
I was using it!
-Quit acting like Yosemite Sam!

00:51.719 --> 00:53.584
| asked you just to stop!
-It came out of my module.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.260
Whoa, hey!
Yo, yo, yo, easy, man!

00:55.348 --> 00:57.054
Remember what the doctors
say about hyper-rage...

00:57.141 --> 00:59.223
John, l have nothing.
Nothing!

00:59.310 --> 01:03.519
I have no wife, no son,
no home, nothing!

01:03.606 --> 01:05.471
I have been forced to
manufacture...
-D'Argo...

01:05.566 --> 01:07.682
distractions in order to live!
- D'Argo, your ship...

01:07.777 --> 01:10.189
That ship is all l have!
-Look... No!

01:10.279 --> 01:14.238
It's your ship...
-You sabotaged my
frelling ship!

01:28.214 --> 01:30.296
(electronic whirring )

01:34.679 --> 01:37.216
(louder whirring)

01:48.276 --> 01:50.642
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

01:50.736 --> 01:54.445
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

01:54.532 --> 01:56.113
I'm trying to stay alive...

01:56.200 --> 01:58.065
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

01:58.160 --> 02:00.867
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.445
If you can hear me...
Beware.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.531
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

02:04.625 --> 02:07.332
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

02:07.420 --> 02:11.880
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.298
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

02:14.385 --> 02:16.842
Not show them...
You exist...

02:16.929 --> 02:20.638
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.995
Jool:
Pilot? Pilot?

02:53.090 --> 02:55.467
Pilot:
I'm sorry, Jool. As you can
understand, lam...

02:55.551 --> 02:57.462
Yeah, yeah, he's not good.

02:57.553 --> 03:00.169
There's some blood in his skull
and some swelling and he's
barely breathing.

03:00.264 --> 03:03.347
Did the power cell in Zhaan's
diagnostic scanner activate?

03:03.434 --> 03:05.720
Anything on its own power
source still works.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.347
Pilot, John's fever's way up.

03:07.438 --> 03:10.271
I can't control the temperature
there, nor much else.

03:10.358 --> 03:14.943
Then energy pulse seared all
Moya's active power conduits.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.190
We're fortunate Comms weren't
in use at the time.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.613
Is that krastic ship still
frelling with us?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.487
Yes. D'Argo feels Crichton's
interference

03:22.578 --> 03:25.490
must have triggered a security
self-destruct sequence.

03:25.581 --> 03:26.866
Can he stop it?

03:26.957 --> 03:30.666
When we last spoke, D'Argo
was rather agitated.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.709
Which part of "I don't know"
has you baffled?

03:32.797 --> 03:34.253
Can't flush the ship out.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.329
The hangar doors won't open.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.880
Can't escape in a
Transport Pod.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.834
The hangar doors won't open!
-Fix the hangar doors.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.294
Pilot has no control.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.925
You really frelled us this
time, didn't you?

03:43.015 --> 03:44.880
Me? It wasn't me!
It was Crichton!

03:44.975 --> 03:47.512
Oh, so you tried to kill him?
-I didn't try and kill him,
he slipped.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.345
You're pathetic, you really
are. And we're all gonna
die because of it.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.395
(yells)

04:01.325 --> 04:03.236
Pilot:
Ka D'Argo!

04:03.327 --> 04:05.613
Your Qualta Blade.

04:06.956 --> 04:08.366
That was mature.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.992
So when's his ship gonna blow?
-Unknown.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.794
Moya and l have no active
sensors in the Transport Hanger.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.293
Yeah, yeah, we get the idea.
What... what do we do?

04:18.384 --> 04:20.170
Reactivate the DRDs.

04:20.261 --> 04:24.721
They're the only ones who
can rewire Moya.
-Rewire?

04:24.807 --> 04:31.804
Your ship crippled every inton
of conduit and power
application running at the time.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.563
Then I'll cripple it.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.898
Chiana (on Comms ):
Hey, Princess?

04:39.989 --> 04:41.195
We're going to die, aren't we?

04:41.282 --> 04:44.069
Eventually. You got the mivonks
to push the date back?

04:44.160 --> 04:46.151
Help D'Argo in the
Transport Hangar.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.236
When he's sick of you, find me.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.500
Scorpius:
You know what's happening?

04:58.591 --> 05:00.001
Yeah.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.212
I'm dying.

05:02.303 --> 05:05.215
Let's see what's left
in the fuel tank.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.888
Go away and let me do
what I gotta do.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.476
Oh what, find a reason to live?

05:09.560 --> 05:11.721
I got plenty of reasons.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.640
Then give me...

05:14.732 --> 05:16.814
the Letterman list.

05:16.901 --> 05:19.734
Earth, Dad, pizza, sex,

05:19.820 --> 05:22.232
cold beer, fast cars, sex,

05:22.323 --> 05:24.279
Aeryn. Love.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.153
Well, we're both dead.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.326
Screw you.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.325
None of that crap will get
the job done, John.

05:32.416 --> 05:36.500
You die, you drag me with you.

05:36.587 --> 05:37.702
You want some advice?

05:37.796 --> 05:39.297
No.
-Revenge.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.667
Revenge?
-Yes.

05:41.759 --> 05:45.172
Love is transient. Vaporous.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.345
And guess who Aeryn loves
right now?

05:48.432 --> 05:49.547
He wins,

05:49.642 --> 05:51.178
youlose.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.348
Thank you for coming, go away.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.472
Revenge is the strongest
emotion, John.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.178
Go away.
-D'Argo put you here.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.265
Live to even the score.
-Goodbye, Scorpy. Bye-bye.

05:59.360 --> 06:04.775
Your mind is no longer strong
enough to control my comings
and goings.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.485
Is that a challenge?

06:12.665 --> 06:14.405
How did you...

06:14.500 --> 06:15.785
( groans )

06:15.876 --> 06:18.868
Ohhh, dear!

06:18.963 --> 06:20.749
Looney Tunes.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.416
Wasted energy, John.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.126
Now focus.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.963
Revenge is deep within
your psyche.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.469
A core vestige from your
earliest evolution.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.516
Unleash it now.

06:34.979 --> 06:36.389
No.

06:39.900 --> 06:45.190
This after school special
dissipates our chances of
survival, John.

06:45.281 --> 06:46.646
You really want revenge?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.401
Oh, yes.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.948
Okay.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.818
(descending whistle)

06:53.706 --> 06:55.242
(gasps )

06:59.378 --> 07:00.834
Revenge.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.912
But only for you.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.252
(gasps )

07:06.343 --> 07:08.379
( growls )

07:11.807 --> 07:13.763
Are you sure that noise means
we're going to explode?

07:13.851 --> 07:14.715
What if it's just a...

07:14.810 --> 07:16.220
Soft core overload.

07:16.312 --> 07:21.306
It's like it wants us to shut
it down, but I don't know how.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.311
But you did it before.

07:23.402 --> 07:28.362
Whatever Crichton did, he
disabled the sequence of
commands l was building up.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.781
I mean, what if it wasn't
Crichton? What if something's
just happened?

07:30.868 --> 07:33.860
I've been off the ground on
this thing four times.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.331
No problems.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.201
He did it.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.828
So dude, how you doin'?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.628
You're dying.

07:45.716 --> 07:48.253
Yeah, yeah, D'Argo tried
to kill me.

07:48.344 --> 07:51.336
Perhaps an overstatement.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.840
Well, same net result.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.922
Is he an enemy you
wish to harm?

07:55.017 --> 07:57.759
Oh man, I don't even know
why we're fighting.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.185
Then rise above his behavior.

08:00.272 --> 08:06.359
Moya and I find it advantageous
to avoid confrontation
by egressing.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.685
Run away?

08:07.780 --> 08:10.066
Aggression feeds on opportunity.

08:10.157 --> 08:15.618
Remove yourself as a target
and the pursuer will
eventually tire.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.949
You're very wise.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.749
I don't get out much,
so I read.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.334
Well thanks for the advice.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.663
You could try it now
if you like.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.248
Um...

08:29.343 --> 08:31.425
Oh, give me a break.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.226
Come on, D'Argo. We're friends.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.145
No more, human.

08:44.233 --> 08:47.270
You can run as much as you
like, but I'm gonna catch ya.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.317
Yee-haw!

09:04.420 --> 09:05.375
D'oh!

09:10.092 --> 09:11.172
(grunts)

09:11.260 --> 09:12.375
Yikes!

09:12.469 --> 09:15.085
Come on, man, chill, before
somebody gets hurt.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.671
Any guesses who, runt?

09:17.766 --> 09:18.755
Better look out.

09:18.851 --> 09:19.636
Right.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.343
Like I am gonna fall for that.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.973
(garbled Russian radio
transmission )

09:29.236 --> 09:31.727
God, I love science fiction.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.358
(honks)

09:44.793 --> 09:46.033
Beep, beep.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.952
Hmm.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.522
(sputtering )

10:40.390 --> 10:41.641
Ah!

10:44.937 --> 10:47.804
This is Farscape One,
I am free and flying.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.607
(humming)

10:54.321 --> 10:55.777
Oh-ho!

10:58.242 --> 10:59.698
Wormhole!

11:09.253 --> 11:10.959
(clank)

11:20.556 --> 11:23.263
(humming)

11:37.614 --> 11:40.105
Yo, Harvey! Front and
center, dude.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.117
Whoa!

11:41.201 --> 11:42.190
Oh.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.242
Pilot was right,
you were wrong.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.285
Pilot was right, you
were wrong.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.830
If I keep running,
nothing can hu...

11:50.252 --> 11:52.117
Nothing can hurt you?

11:52.212 --> 11:54.373
Is that what you're
trying to say?

11:56.466 --> 11:58.172
( screams )

11:58.635 --> 12:00.341
( screaming )

12:02.973 --> 12:06.591
You can only run for
so long, John.

12:06.685 --> 12:10.348
Even in the childlike safety
of your cartoon.

12:10.439 --> 12:13.931
My way will sustain you.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.232
Mother's milk.

12:15.861 --> 12:16.976
Brutal...

12:17.070 --> 12:18.105
(grunts)

12:18.196 --> 12:19.276
real...

12:19.364 --> 12:20.695
(grunts)

12:20.782 --> 12:22.283
revenge.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.903
(grunts)

12:26.371 --> 12:28.202
John!

12:28.290 --> 12:31.999
Take revenge, John!

12:32.085 --> 12:36.454
Chiana's efforts with the DRDs
have restored minimal
functioning.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.665
We now have a presence in
the Maintenance Bay

12:39.760 --> 12:44.220
and our analysis of that ship's
energy signature indicates

12:44.306 --> 12:47.890
it will explode in just
under an em.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.432
Under an em?

12:49.519 --> 12:52.682
An estimate only.

12:55.359 --> 12:56.644
Can you do something?

12:56.735 --> 13:01.525
We will not be able to
expel that ship.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.480
So we're all going to die?

13:03.575 --> 13:06.282
Moya and myself certainly.

13:06.370 --> 13:10.989
However, I may have a
way to save you.

13:11.083 --> 13:15.201
Take food, liquids and a
long-range frequency modulator

13:15.295 --> 13:19.254
to Tier Sixteen's Treblin side
pressure hatchway.

13:19.341 --> 13:23.710
You should be able to survive
a few solar days

13:23.804 --> 13:27.012
prior to hypothermia,
if I jettison it.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.340
(cries):
Oh, Pilot...

13:29.434 --> 13:30.844
Go.

13:30.936 --> 13:33.427
We can't just leave you.

13:33.689 --> 13:36.305
Go!

13:36.400 --> 13:39.312
Gotcha, Princess. Treblin side
hatch, Tier Sixteen.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.314
I'm gonna try something then
I'll meet you in the
cold storage.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.645
We're not leaving
without Crichton.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.354
Jool:
But Pilot said...

13:44.449 --> 13:47.532
An arn! Load the supplies,
do what I tell you.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.659
Children.

13:51.415 --> 13:54.077
D'Argo:
Nothing works. I've failed.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.543
Move, D'Argo.
Let Mommy shoot it.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.583
No, no, no, no, no.
It won't let you.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.286
Well let's get out of here.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.297
I don't like to lose.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.921
Well then why'd you
let go of me?

14:05.012 --> 14:07.173
(speaking Luxan )

14:07.264 --> 14:10.506
(electronic whirring )

14:12.519 --> 14:14.020
What'd you say?

14:14.104 --> 14:16.516
Just something Luxan. My
grandfather used to say
it all the time.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.187
Hey! What are you doing?

14:18.275 --> 14:23.315
I'm not quite sure but I think
that is a Luxan symbol for
"spoken word."

14:23.405 --> 14:24.611
You can read that?

14:24.698 --> 14:26.154
A little bit.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.323
I'm not really up on
my ancient Luxan.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.493
( synthesized voice speaking )

14:32.205 --> 14:33.581
What?

14:34.416 --> 14:36.156
What's it saying?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.161
What?!

14:37.252 --> 14:38.082
I don't know!

14:38.170 --> 14:39.250
Well, is it Luxan?
-Yes.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.123
Well then how can you not know?

14:42.924 --> 14:44.175
I'm not ancient Luxan.

14:44.259 --> 14:48.218
I do not speak ancient Luxan and
I do not read ancient Luxan,

14:48.305 --> 14:50.466
because I am not ancient Luxan.

14:52.934 --> 14:56.768
And not likely to
become one, either.

14:56.855 --> 15:00.518
Moya's dead-language library
is incomplete.
-What about ancient war declarations?

15:00.609 --> 15:04.147
My access to it at this time
even more so. -Historical
fragments? Even the...

15:04.237 --> 15:06.148
transcription of speeches?
You can even try some...

15:06.239 --> 15:08.525
At best, I am finding
only words.
-anti-Luxan propaganda.

15:08.617 --> 15:09.823
Fragments of words.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.151
Pilot, that ship is trying
to kill us.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.281
I need to know why
it speaks Luxan.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.408
The DRDs can prepare a
supplemental...

15:16.500 --> 15:18.616
Translator Microbe
injection with...
-Good. Good. Do it.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.622
any data that I un... Ah!

15:21.713 --> 15:23.249
How can he not learn his
ancient tongue?

15:23.340 --> 15:25.171
What kind of civilization
doesn't pass on its culture?

15:25.258 --> 15:28.796
They're warriors. Most of them
didn't learn to read or write
until 300 cycles ago.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.252
It's ridiculous. It's savage.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.338
I'll wager there are no artists
or chefs there either.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.933
What is your problem?

15:35.102 --> 15:36.091
I did it.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.972
You usually do. What?

15:38.063 --> 15:39.519
l was in his ship.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.436
What?

15:40.524 --> 15:41.809
|didn't mean to. I...

15:41.900 --> 15:44.232
You need to die horribly.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.354
Oh, like you never screw up.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.310
You'd compare this
to anything I do?

15:47.405 --> 15:50.021
Don't you think I feel bad?

15:50.117 --> 15:51.277
because I think I can
trust you...
-do not go near his ship.

15:51.368 --> 15:55.532
and what do you do?
-So what do you do?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.362
Let's just be a nasty little
Nebari tramp!
-Only problem is, someone would have gotten your body parts

15:57.457 --> 15:59.368
Just shut up!
-Just shut up!

16:01.503 --> 16:02.492
All right.
-Okay.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.670
All right, you go.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.294
I didn't actually touch
anything in the ship.
-I think actually the best thing to do is just to calm down...

16:08.385 --> 16:12.253
Maybe it was something
that Crichton did,
-and figure this out.

16:12.347 --> 16:15.805
there's no reason D'Argo should
be mad at me, is there?
-So I think the best thing to do is...

16:15.892 --> 16:17.473
I just don't know how can
I make my point...
-get ready in case Pilot's gotta blow Moya apart to save us.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.142
when you will not...
-Oh, skelnick, would you...

16:19.229 --> 16:21.265
Both:
...stop talking!

16:22.440 --> 16:23.816
Okay.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.274
My personal, growing hatred for
you will be set aside...
-and if you'll just back me, I'll never ask for

16:30.365 --> 16:32.276
Girls!
-Would you just let me speak!

16:32.367 --> 16:35.404
What are you doing?! Huh?!

16:36.371 --> 16:37.577
Jool:
Uhhh...

16:40.292 --> 16:41.748
Having a conversation.
-Yeah.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.790
Having a conversation?

16:42.878 --> 16:44.118
Obviously very interesting.

16:44.212 --> 16:48.376
Listen, this is my only chance
with these Translator Microbes.

16:48.466 --> 16:51.924
If it doesn't work, be here,
ready, okay?

16:52.012 --> 16:53.297
Yeah.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.548
Now, you listen to me.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.470
D'Argo has a lot on his
mind at the moment.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.298
If we survive, you tell him
anything you like.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.850
ljust need to...
-No! Do not...

17:00.937 --> 17:02.768
do not tell him.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.312
Crichton:
Isn't she great?

17:08.403 --> 17:10.735
Yeah, I'm thrilled with
our relationship.

17:10.822 --> 17:14.610
Well, D'Argo and l aren't
gettin' along too good
these days, either.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.032
Yeah.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.734
He put you in a coma.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.241
I gotta figure out what
to do about that.

17:20.332 --> 17:21.742
How hard's that?

17:21.833 --> 17:23.573
You're gonna die.

17:23.668 --> 17:27.832
Well, Scorpy thinks I should
get revenge.

17:27.923 --> 17:31.165
Pilot wanted me to run,
but that didn't work.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.250
You got any ideas?

17:33.345 --> 17:36.132
You once said to me that our
species might be related.

17:36.223 --> 17:40.842
If that's true, you have to
have a measure of intelligence
about you,

17:40.936 --> 17:42.176
which means you can reason.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.761
Be honest. Talk to him.
Work out the problem.

17:45.941 --> 17:48.432
Conflict's for barbarians.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.363
Jool:
D'Argo.

17:56.451 --> 18:00.945
( synthesized voice speaking )

18:19.432 --> 18:22.174
I think it may have been me.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.260
l was in here earlier.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.185
|didn't touch anything,
I was just here.

18:26.273 --> 18:29.515
I found this in the control.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.895
Your hair!

18:34.197 --> 18:35.357
Are you gonna to kill me?

18:35.448 --> 18:38.064
I've already hurt
Crichton today.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.195
That's enough.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.073
|didn't mean to
cause any of...

18:42.163 --> 18:43.494
Well what did you mean?

18:43.581 --> 18:46.118
I mean, what were you
doing in here?!

18:51.506 --> 18:56.500
I know that I can be difficult.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.336
That no one wants to
spend time with me.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.222
You're someone who...

19:04.686 --> 19:06.267
I like.

19:08.565 --> 19:13.104
And I know that since the
problems with your son
and Chiana,

19:14.362 --> 19:17.069
that you've preferred
to be alone.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.609
In here.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.159
| just thought,

19:23.246 --> 19:27.831
if this is so important to you,

19:27.917 --> 19:30.124
then maybe...

19:30.211 --> 19:34.454
maybe if I learn a
little about it,

19:34.549 --> 19:38.667
we might have something
to talk about.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.217
Oh.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.193
Thanks for making the effort.

20:00.075 --> 20:01.656
Crichton:
D'Argo, we're friends, right?

20:01.743 --> 20:04.450
And friends don't let
friends drive drunk.
It's just kind of...

20:04.537 --> 20:06.448
(clearing throat)

20:11.753 --> 20:13.539
Wow.

20:13.630 --> 20:14.790
You look great.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.998
Ha. Is this the best
you could do?

20:18.093 --> 20:20.926
I, uh... I miss you.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.252
Obviously.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.712
Where are my clothes?

20:23.807 --> 20:26.298
On Talyn. You and
that other guy.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.724
The other me. You're not, uh...

20:27.811 --> 20:30.518
Mm, don't do it to
yourself, John.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.398
Right.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.722
Oh, no, no, no.

20:33.817 --> 20:35.899
Before you go, you fix this.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.241
(rubbing)

20:55.130 --> 20:56.961
Mm-hmm...

20:57.048 --> 21:01.087
I get it. "I'm not bad.
I'm just drawn that way."

21:02.011 --> 21:03.547
Oh, please!

21:03.638 --> 21:06.050
At least use some imagination.

21:07.976 --> 21:14.472
Happy birthday,
Mr. Astronaut...

21:14.566 --> 21:17.399
"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore
art thou Romeo?"

21:17.485 --> 21:20.693
Honey, that's the
wrong Shakespeare.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.362
( heels clicking )
There's no place like home.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.869
Hey, Johnny. Like a virgin?

21:26.953 --> 21:30.366
I'll like... rescue you.

21:30.457 --> 21:34.166
Can you do that Sharon Stone
thing? Basic Instinct?

21:34.252 --> 21:35.662
Johnny, just say...

21:35.753 --> 21:36.663
No!

21:36.754 --> 21:38.415
There's a good boy.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.009
Thank you.

21:42.093 --> 21:44.300
Now, what are you gonna
do about D'Argo?

21:44.387 --> 21:46.878
I don't know. I'm supposed
to talk to him.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.929
Not really sure what to say.
Any advice?

21:49.017 --> 21:50.177
Help?

21:50.268 --> 21:52.884
D'Argo.

21:52.979 --> 21:56.767
D'Argo, could you just leave
young Johnny alone, please?

21:56.858 --> 21:58.974
Um...

21:59.068 --> 22:00.399
No.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.987
Run, Forrest! Run!

22:09.204 --> 22:11.160
Ah!

22:11.247 --> 22:12.703
( Crichton whistling )

22:14.250 --> 22:16.161
(evil chuckling)

22:18.213 --> 22:19.419
(humming)

22:22.008 --> 22:24.841
Come on, D, let... let's
talk this out.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.377
Ha, ha! Never!

22:27.472 --> 22:29.258
Ladies, coming through.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.548
Grr...

22:42.320 --> 22:43.400
(grunts)

22:45.281 --> 22:48.239
( Scottish accent ):
Captain, we hit something with
the front of the ship.

22:48.326 --> 22:49.816
( screeching )

22:56.084 --> 22:57.574
D'Argo!

22:57.669 --> 22:59.159
We're friends, big man.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.212
How about a little rock, paper,
scissors to work through your...

23:02.590 --> 23:03.750
anger?

23:03.841 --> 23:05.923
Idon't think so, John.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.342
You'd really shoot me?

23:08.429 --> 23:10.260
We could get counseling.
I know a guy.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.842
Dr. Chuck Jones, wrote the...

23:17.272 --> 23:20.355
Dr. Chuck Jones wrote the book
on these situations.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.605
( screams )

23:31.244 --> 23:33.735
Jool, babe, you were right...

23:33.830 --> 23:34.819
You think so?

23:34.914 --> 23:36.996
You think you could
reason with me?

23:38.376 --> 23:40.037
( screaming )
-Clear!

23:40.837 --> 23:42.043
Clear!

23:43.214 --> 23:44.499
( frustrated grunt )

23:57.979 --> 24:01.267
You feel the life ebbing
from both of us, John?

24:01.357 --> 24:04.019
The creep of cadaverous cold?
Achilles, I believe.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.819
Your strength as weakness.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.987
Your stubbornness has served
you well in the past,

24:10.074 --> 24:12.941
but now it is killing you, John.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.448
These cartoons are a crutch,

24:15.538 --> 24:19.907
attempting to shield yourself
instead of doing what
is called for.

24:20.418 --> 24:22.909
Revenge.

24:23.004 --> 24:27.088
D'Argo, the DRD should be
there any microt.

24:27.175 --> 24:29.837
All I could do was piece
together fragments of language,

24:29.927 --> 24:32.714
an incomplete vocabulary,
at best.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.343
That's all anyone
could ask, Pilot.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.674
Let's give it a shot.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.976
Pilot:
The DRD will inject you.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.393
Ow.

24:44.359 --> 24:48.898
( synthesized voice speaking
ancient Luxan )

24:49.405 --> 24:50.485
What's it say?

24:50.573 --> 24:52.029
Shh.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.153
D'Argo, you have to tell me.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.623
( synthesized voice speaking )

24:59.707 --> 25:04.246
Active self-destruct code
can be voided...

25:04.337 --> 25:06.373
with one of three...

25:06.464 --> 25:13.427
ah, predetermined artifacts,
singular to Luxan heritage.

25:14.806 --> 25:19.345
Ancient freedom text.
It's very rare.

25:19.435 --> 25:23.223
An Orican's prayer amulet.
This is hopeless.

25:23.314 --> 25:26.147
( synthesized voice continues )

25:26.234 --> 25:28.316
Synthesized voice:
...Qualta Blade.

25:30.613 --> 25:31.944
What?

25:33.449 --> 25:34.985
What? What does it want?

25:38.037 --> 25:40.198
What?

25:40.289 --> 25:43.827
Synthesized voice:
...Qualta Blade.

25:43.918 --> 25:47.285
With so little time left,
I suggest you all start
to prepare...

25:47.380 --> 25:48.916
Begin searching immediately.

25:49.006 --> 25:51.497
Now, I threw it over in
this direction here.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.547
Why would you do that?

25:52.635 --> 25:54.421
Short version? 'Cause of you.

25:54.512 --> 25:59.347
Now, I heard it falling so it
could be on one of those
tiers down there or,

25:59.434 --> 26:02.096
ah, it could've fallen all the
way down to the neural cluster.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.016
So we split up and search.

26:03.104 --> 26:04.969
Pilot:
A caution.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.727
The DRDs use this empty cavern
to deposit construction
and repair refuse.

26:08.818 --> 26:10.399
It's a reasonable risk.
-Some of the

26:10.486 --> 26:11.862
Start searching.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.314
Hey, Pip. You got a sec?

26:16.409 --> 26:17.364
Sure.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.026
You up on everything
that's going on?

26:20.121 --> 26:21.952
Yeah. You're dying.
-Yeah.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.654
Scorpius wants you
to get revenge.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.789
Pilot says run like a...
a scalded kepnitz.
-Yeah.

26:27.879 --> 26:31.292
And Jool would talk
D'Argo's ear off till
he committed suicide.

26:33.176 --> 26:35.883
So, uh, what do you think?

26:35.970 --> 26:37.835
Well, revenge is sweet.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.511
It's always worth the effort.

26:39.599 --> 26:42.341
Ooh!

26:42.435 --> 26:45.802
Why do I get the cellar and
you guys get the catwalk?

26:48.733 --> 26:50.223
This place smells horrible.

26:50.318 --> 26:52.309
Chiana:
Guaranteed by your arrival.

26:52.403 --> 26:53.233
Sugnu

26:53.321 --> 26:55.232
( scolding ):
Chiana.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.689
What do you want, D'Argo?
What, I should bottle it up
and become a Luxan?

26:57.784 --> 27:00.446
Showing a little bit of self
restraint wouldn't hurt.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.446
Any luck?

27:01.537 --> 27:04.244
Just crap. And dren.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.163
Hey Princess, watch out.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.627
Jool:
Watch out for what?

27:08.711 --> 27:11.077
Chunks of metal. Don't get hit.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.754
There's no metal down here,
there's just muck.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.001
Do you have muck?

27:15.092 --> 27:17.424
Oh, yeah. Up to my
crutch in it.

27:17.512 --> 27:19.719
Aah! Chiana, Jool, watch out!

27:19.806 --> 27:21.012
For what?!

27:21.098 --> 27:22.599
( screams )

27:25.561 --> 27:27.222
You little slut.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.271
No, no. It wasn't Chiana,
it was me.

27:30.358 --> 27:33.270
Then how did she know?

27:33.361 --> 27:34.897
I don't know.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.194
Just made sense.

27:38.449 --> 27:42.943
No revenge, no talking,
no running.

27:43.037 --> 27:45.779
Come on, baby. You're the
sultana of survival.

27:45.873 --> 27:47.488
What's left?

27:49.836 --> 27:51.667
Be smarter.

27:51.754 --> 27:55.167
They always make it more
complicated than what
they need to.

27:55.258 --> 27:57.169
Use it against 'em.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.876
Screw 'em at their own game.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.091
That's good.

28:41.012 --> 28:42.343
(stifled giggling )

28:45.224 --> 28:47.135
( sizzling )

28:47.226 --> 28:48.762
( sizzling )

28:56.569 --> 28:58.309
( rattling )

28:59.697 --> 29:00.652
Pilot?

29:00.740 --> 29:02.480
Yes, Joolushko.

29:02.575 --> 29:07.786
Are there... other things
living in Moya with us?

29:07.872 --> 29:12.992
A panoply of harmless
parasites, many serving
symbiotic functions.

29:13.085 --> 29:16.919
Perhaps you're hearing the
Hodian trill-bat swarm.

29:17.006 --> 29:18.166
(animal chittering )

29:18.257 --> 29:22.216
Do these Hodian bat things...

29:22.303 --> 29:23.759
leave droppings?

29:23.846 --> 29:25.802
Extensively.

29:25.890 --> 29:30.304
Their effluvium spreads along
Moya's inner hull and helps
seal microscopic cracks.

29:30.394 --> 29:31.349
Bat dren.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.938
You're walking through it.

29:33.022 --> 29:37.732
( piercing scream )

29:52.041 --> 29:53.406
Missed me. Ha.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.540
(laughing)

30:02.426 --> 30:04.212
( groans )

30:06.430 --> 30:08.591
Yo, D'Argo.

30:08.683 --> 30:10.548
Look down.

30:10.643 --> 30:11.974
( screams )

30:41.173 --> 30:42.424
(bang)

31:02.528 --> 31:04.484
(birds chirping)

31:07.616 --> 31:09.231
( sizzling )

31:11.037 --> 31:12.823
( screams )

31:20.337 --> 31:21.326
Ah!

31:24.467 --> 31:25.832
(honks)

31:45.404 --> 31:47.144
Don't you get it, D'Argo?

31:47.239 --> 31:50.902
Chiana was right.
I can always outsmart you.

31:50.993 --> 31:55.657
You got to admit it.
My wormhole looks a lot
better than yours.

31:55.748 --> 31:59.286
You... did not...
paint... a wormhole!

31:59.376 --> 32:01.628
You forgot to make yours swirl.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.091
Buh-bye.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.336
Well, this little spaceman's
going home.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.794
Lock up the women and
hide the fried chicken!

32:14.391 --> 32:16.302
( groans )

32:21.190 --> 32:23.727
I think I broke my leg.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.280
Did you think you could
make up all the rules?

32:33.619 --> 32:36.656
Keep hiding behind a
cartoon forever?

32:38.415 --> 32:39.951
No!

32:42.878 --> 32:45.540
( long beep )

32:49.927 --> 32:53.294
( long beep )

32:53.389 --> 32:56.472
Scorpius:
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today to pay our final respects

32:56.559 --> 33:02.179
and to say farewell to our dear
friend Commander John Crichton,

33:02.273 --> 33:04.855
a schmuck.

33:04.942 --> 33:11.313
Mule headed, reckless and
probably brain dead before
I met him.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.991
Alas, his death...

33:17.413 --> 33:19.620
is mine also.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.455
(sighs)

33:27.673 --> 33:30.085
Even I don't know if
it's too late.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.880
We could already be gone.

33:33.971 --> 33:35.802
I love Aeryn.

33:35.890 --> 33:37.380
That should be enough.

33:37.474 --> 33:41.342
Oh, soft emotion won't
get the job done.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.765
Revenge?

33:47.860 --> 33:50.192
Crichton to D'Argo.
Man to beast.

33:50.279 --> 33:53.567
Destroy the bastard, John.

33:53.657 --> 33:56.034
If only in your own mind.

33:57.620 --> 34:02.284
Marty Goldstein stole my
bike when l was seven.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.992
I went over to his house and
I gave him a bloody nose.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.169
Powerful emotion, revenge.

34:10.341 --> 34:12.127
I coulda just taken
the bike back.

34:12.218 --> 34:16.177
Yes. But can you just take
your life back, John?

34:17.264 --> 34:19.801
I don't wanna be
like other people.

34:19.892 --> 34:22.508
I don't wanna be like you.

34:22.603 --> 34:23.934
I don't wanna stoop that low.

34:24.021 --> 34:25.227
Kirk wouldn't stoop that low.

34:25.314 --> 34:28.306
Oh, that was a television
show, John.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.813
And he made Priceline
commercials.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.233
But if you insist.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.610
Then look to Kirk the
way he really was.

34:37.701 --> 34:40.113
Savage when he had to be.
(thunder rumbles)

34:40.204 --> 34:43.196
He's a fiction, Harv.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.622
I know the difference.

34:45.709 --> 34:47.791
I'm real. I have to live
with what I do.

34:47.878 --> 34:51.211
You can no more deny your
biologic heritage

34:51.298 --> 34:55.758
than to change your
grandparents' birthplace.

34:55.844 --> 34:59.177
These primitive animal urges
you think you must resist,

34:59.265 --> 35:01.256
they're not relics from
an uncivilized time.

35:01.350 --> 35:03.682
They are in you for a reason.

35:05.646 --> 35:07.932
Because you need them.

35:10.526 --> 35:13.768
No cartoons, John.
You can take him.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.443
(grunts)

35:21.287 --> 35:23.619
(clang)

35:23.706 --> 35:25.367
(grunts)

35:31.588 --> 35:33.203
(yells)

35:37.052 --> 35:38.883
(clank)

35:41.724 --> 35:43.430
( screams )

35:45.436 --> 35:46.596
(grunts)

35:56.405 --> 35:59.613
(snap )
(yells )

36:25.809 --> 36:28.391
(mimicking Bugs Bunny):
Eh, what's up, D'Argo?

36:28.479 --> 36:30.390
I'll tell you what's up.

36:30.481 --> 36:32.346
I'm going to kill you!

36:32.441 --> 36:34.397
Idon't think so.

36:39.365 --> 36:40.571
(yells)

36:40.657 --> 36:43.399
(shrieking)

36:43.494 --> 36:45.325
Frell.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.115
Chiana.

36:48.207 --> 36:50.163
Still nothing.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.330
Pilot?

36:51.418 --> 36:52.919
(shrieking)

36:53.003 --> 36:57.337
I will again suggest you
head immediately for the
escape hatchway.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.210
At least save yourselves.

36:59.301 --> 37:01.883
Good idea. About time!

37:01.970 --> 37:04.256
(shrieks)

37:11.980 --> 37:13.231
Princess?

37:22.408 --> 37:25.320
(laughing)

37:40.926 --> 37:42.166
I have the Qualta Blade!

37:42.261 --> 37:45.094
(speaking Luxan )
I have the Qualta Blade!

37:45.180 --> 37:47.592
( synthesized voice speaking
ancient Luxan )

37:47.683 --> 37:49.219
I have the Qualta Blade!

37:50.436 --> 37:52.597
I have the Qualta Blade!

37:57.568 --> 37:58.899
( synthesized voice stops )

38:07.286 --> 38:10.403
This is kinda like the sound
you hear before you die.

38:11.373 --> 38:13.238
Or after.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.515
Okay, you frellnik, it's
your turn to die.

38:35.606 --> 38:37.938
( sizzling )

38:46.909 --> 38:49.275
On with the show, this is it!

38:49.369 --> 38:51.405
No cartoons, no crushes.
Revenge.

38:51.497 --> 38:56.287
I'd like to thank the Academy
( kiss ) for this beautiful
Oscar. ( kiss )

38:56.376 --> 38:58.537
Oh, shut up, John.
It's not presentation night.

38:58.629 --> 38:59.914
You ought to be thanking me.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.085
For what?

39:01.173 --> 39:03.630
For saving your life.

39:06.470 --> 39:10.429
Sorry, Harv. No joy.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.632
I gave it a shot. You could
have been right.

39:12.726 --> 39:14.307
You were wrong.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.180
I don't understand.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.522
'Course you don't understand.

39:17.606 --> 39:19.562
You live in the country but you
do not speak the language.

39:19.650 --> 39:23.643
Just don't... don't touch
anything in here.
You... You're clueless.

39:23.737 --> 39:26.399
No, John. Revenge.

39:29.201 --> 39:32.785
For you, it's a way of life.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.328
For me, it's not the answer.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.872
Then we're dead.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.700
(thunder crashing)

39:39.795 --> 39:42.662
Crichton:
Don't ever distract me from
what I really feel.

39:44.883 --> 39:51.300
Harv, I... love... Aeryn.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.493
I appreciate your help, though.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.450
That's all, folks.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.211
(grunts)

40:32.347 --> 40:34.338
( gruff synthesized voice ):
Identify yourself.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.214
Hey.

40:38.979 --> 40:41.311
I'm Ka D'Argo

40:41.398 --> 40:47.769
Son of Laytun, grandson
of Reska,

40:47.863 --> 40:53.733
and I am the great-grandson
of Ka D'Argo Treytal.

40:53.827 --> 40:57.536
Power systems at your
command, Ka D'Argo.

40:57.623 --> 41:00.114
Telemetry functions
at your command.

41:00.208 --> 41:02.950
Deception Shroud
at your command.

41:03.045 --> 41:05.582
Sonic Accelerator
at your command.

41:05.672 --> 41:09.164
Particalization Field
at your command.

41:09.259 --> 41:11.375
Weapons Cascade
at your command.

41:11.470 --> 41:14.132
Communications Array
at your command.

41:14.222 --> 41:16.599
( laughs )
Eyes clear.

41:20.771 --> 41:22.227
( laughs )

41:22.314 --> 41:23.975
You did it!

41:26.943 --> 41:28.399
I did it.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.356
I did it.

41:30.447 --> 41:31.937
( laughs )

41:32.032 --> 41:34.114
(groggily )1
Hey, guys.

41:35.285 --> 41:37.446
The lights are all out.

41:38.455 --> 41:41.288
Maybe we should call someone.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.252
Jool:
This stuff will not come off.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.170
Chiana:
Lucky for you it doesn't smell.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.918
It smells terrible.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.169
Right.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.797
I mean, lucky for me we
don't share quarters.

41:56.306 --> 41:59.890
You know, I think you should
just show a little more respect.

41:59.976 --> 42:01.591
Without my sacrifice
you would...

42:01.687 --> 42:03.894
We would have all perished.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.266
Moya and I thank you, Jool.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.394
You're welcome, Pilot.

42:08.485 --> 42:10.476
Oh, if I were you, I'd clean
out that lower level

42:10.570 --> 42:13.357
if you ever expect me to
go down there again.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.359
Yes, of course.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.111
Well, you won't have to go
down there again

42:17.202 --> 42:19.693
if you stopped frelling around
with other people's stuff.

42:24.292 --> 42:26.783
Excuse me.

42:26.878 --> 42:30.291
D'Argo and I have already
sorted all that.

42:30.382 --> 42:32.919
I'm gonna take the first
ride on his ship when he
figures it all out.

42:33.009 --> 42:34.260
Oh?

42:36.304 --> 42:37.965
Kids.

42:41.184 --> 42:42.560
D'Argo:
Crichton, I know you're
out there.

42:42.644 --> 42:47.308
If you won't talk to me, can
you at least just listen?

42:49.943 --> 42:53.731
Somehow saying I'm sorry
seems so inadequate.

42:53.822 --> 42:56.188
Ah, we'll get through it.

42:56.283 --> 42:58.524
I've so much rage inside.

42:58.618 --> 43:00.483
So many things.

43:02.497 --> 43:05.079
Sometimes, I...

43:08.003 --> 43:10.790
I just need to control
it better.

43:10.881 --> 43:12.746
Well, now would be a good
time to learn.

43:12.841 --> 43:15.127
You got a baby ship to feed.

43:15.218 --> 43:17.675
It's a curse, John.

43:17.763 --> 43:23.224
A warrior heritage,
my instincts.

43:23.310 --> 43:26.177
You just gotta know when
to control 'em, bro.

43:30.233 --> 43:33.350
We have a code.

43:33.445 --> 43:36.983
Aggression against an ally
entitles retribution.

43:38.992 --> 43:41.904
D'Argo, look at me.

43:45.248 --> 43:50.117
There's nothing that would ever
make me take revenge on you.

43:56.301 --> 43:58.132
Thank you.

44:02.432 --> 44:05.344
When you were dead,

44:05.435 --> 44:08.302
did you know you were dead?

44:08.814 --> 44:10.679
I mean... No.

44:11.650 --> 44:13.891
What went through your mind?

44:15.111 --> 44:17.272
What did you see?

44:21.409 --> 44:26.369
Buddy, that would be impossible
for me to explain to you.

44:40.428 --> 44:41.929
(craft whooshing )

44:43.348 --> 44:44.884
( craft whirring )
