underemployed, mostly...

04:04.845 --> 04:08.046
What's the word I'm looking for?
Not alcoholic-- 'cause we don't

And for the first time ever,

didn't make nothin' happen,

05:43.477 --> 05:46.812

just an amazing stroke of luck.

What you need is some help.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.700
Maybe I should go call Jesus.

06:08.702 --> 06:12.637
You don't need Jesus. You need
what they call representation.

06:12.639 --> 06:15.974
And that's why I'm gonna
step up, be your manager.

06:15.976 --> 06:20.379
Whatever. I'm gonna get drunk

have accepted Jesus in my life.

06:41.335 --> 06:43.835
I'm a follower
and a humble servant.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.338
Okay, that's cool. But like
I said, what's this nigga

06:46.340 --> 06:50.342

Well, I invited Jesus so
he could give us divine support.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.403
And when the alcohol is
pouring down on the shoes,

Hey, Vic.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.222
I see you over there lookin'
BHL, blessed and highly favored.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.057
What's so funny?

18:13.059 --> 18:16.194
(laughing loudly)

18:16.196 --> 18:17.361
Hey, Vic!

18:17.363 --> 18:18.930
(laughs)
Yeah.
Hey!

18:18.932 --> 18:22.533
What's up, Lloyd?
If it ain't the Darby Man.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.869
Heard about you
on TMZ, nigga.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.405
Jesus, you should've told me the
paparazzi was out there waiting

18:27.407 --> 18:28.272
to ambush me!

18:28.274 --> 18:29.373
You know, you two niggas

18:29.375 --> 18:30.575
deserve each other.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.243
'Cause you're both frauds.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.545
LLOYD:
Oh, Vic, come on.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.047
I let fame go to my head,
and I forgot

18:36.049 --> 18:38.249
about the important things
in life, like...

18:38.251 --> 18:40.084
our friendship and hating Jesus.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.252
Don't you forgive me,

18:41.254 --> 18:42.386
Vic? Don't you forgive me?

18:42.388 --> 18:44.889
No, I don't.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.058
Come on, Vic.
Keep it one fow-wow.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.759
You wasn't a little bit envious
of this dude?

18:48.761 --> 18:52.396
Envious? Heh. Of a nigga
that smell like week-old piss?

18:52.398 --> 18:54.232
Come on, brah.
So you weren't

18:54.234 --> 18:57.602
coveting this dude's new money
and fame, not even a little bit,

18:57.604 --> 18:59.303
hatin' on his get-down?
And you know

18:59.305 --> 19:01.272
you was out of line for
forcing yourself as a manager

19:01.274 --> 19:03.741
on this dude, knowing
you ain't got no experience.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.477
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I'm not apologizing
for that.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.279
I was trying to help.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.082
Oh, were you really? Or were you
just trying to lock him down

19:11.084 --> 19:14.285
'cause you didn't want
to lose his friendship, Victor?

19:14.287 --> 19:15.486
Oh, is that true, Vic?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.921
You was
tryin' to lock down

19:16.923 --> 19:18.990
so you could keep me
as your friend?

19:18.992 --> 19:23.294
Oh, yeah, yeah. I missed the
smelly-ass nigga on my couch.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.130
Let me make it up, Vic.
See, they had to pay me out

19:26.132 --> 19:27.598
of my contract. See?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.267
So I could be known

19:29.269 --> 19:30.835
as a rent-paying roommate.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.470
You're paying rent?

19:32.472 --> 19:34.939
Come on in, Lloyd. Come on in.
Get your... Get all your stuff.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.440
Get all your bags.
Get everything. Let me help you

19:36.442 --> 19:38.109
with your stuff. Let me help you
with this right here.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.111
I got... I got this. Oh,
yeah, I got this, too.

19:40.113 --> 19:43.014
Let me get your back here.
Man, you get back, nigga.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.850
LLOYD:
Once again,

19:45.852 --> 19:47.952
faith and love in you
ain't shit.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.620
VIC:
That's right, Lloyd.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.289
He's a con man.
Con man!

19:51.291 --> 19:55.126
Yeah. See, now you can hang
out with your real friends.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.861
JESUS:
It's all good though,

19:56.863 --> 19:58.196
'cause I love the love.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.330
Con man!

19:59.332 --> 20:00.531
Hey, Lloyd!

20:00.533 --> 20:04.035
You forgot your shit, dawg!

20:04.803 --> 20:06.637
Thank you, Jesus!

20:06.639 --> 20:08.906
You welcome!
