WEBVTT

00:00.035 --> 00:01.127
Forget it, Spellman.

00:01.203 --> 00:04.366
From crazed hockey fan
to arm candy in the same outfit?

00:04.540 --> 00:06.201
Ain't gonna happen.

00:06.375 --> 00:08.468
Why don't they make a dress
that's low-cut in the back

00:08.644 --> 00:09.770
with numbers on the front?

00:09.945 --> 00:11.242
You're on your own.

00:11.413 --> 00:12.710
Well, I've got to find something.

00:12.881 --> 00:14.371
These are important clients
of Aaron's,

00:14.550 --> 00:16.381
and I promised Harvey
I'd make it to his game.

00:16.552 --> 00:18.247
I'm not the kind of girl
who ditches her friends

00:18.420 --> 00:20.012
the minute she gets a boyfriend.

00:20.189 --> 00:22.248
How long are you gonna keep
throwing that in my face?

00:23.125 --> 00:24.820
Well, here's your chance
to redeem yourself.

00:24.994 --> 00:27.326
- That's Aaron, go entertain him.
- No problem.

00:27.496 --> 00:28.520
And not by playing

00:28.698 --> 00:30.563
Have You Ever Dated Two
Roommates At The Same Time.

00:30.733 --> 00:33.201
Oh. Well, I'll come up with something.

00:35.971 --> 00:38.997
Oh, I wish I had picked up
my black pants from the dry cleaner.

00:39.175 --> 00:41.268
Just spitballing,
but maybe you could work out

00:41.444 --> 00:44.777
this seemingly unsolvable conundrum
by using a little magic.

00:44.947 --> 00:48.144
Ooh, it seems someone's
14-hour power nap paid off.

00:52.488 --> 00:53.512
Excellent.

00:53.689 --> 00:56.522
Uh, nice try. Pants are 7 bucks.

00:56.692 --> 00:58.956
Oh, it says here they do fur.

00:59.128 --> 01:00.425
Fur? Ha, ha.

01:00.596 --> 01:02.826
Oh, no, come on. Oh, hey.

01:02.998 --> 01:05.899
Not funny. Oh, please, no, no, no.

01:06.068 --> 01:09.799
No! Light starch, please.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.144 --> 01:50.476
Oh, my friends are gonna kill me.

01:50.646 --> 01:52.341
I missed the game,
I missed the pizza party.

01:52.515 --> 01:54.244
And you're about to miss a kiss.

01:54.417 --> 01:56.578
Oh, well, I have my priorities.

01:56.752 --> 01:59.653
Mm. And I'm sure your friends
will understand.

01:59.822 --> 02:01.483
You're right.
I mean, these things happen.

02:01.657 --> 02:03.090
It's not like it was anyone's fault.

02:03.626 --> 02:05.287
It was Aaron's fault.

02:05.461 --> 02:07.554
Hi, Aaron Jacobs. Scapegoat.

02:07.730 --> 02:09.390
An escaped goat?

02:09.565 --> 02:10.622
Oh, come on, Sabrina.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.098
You can come up
with a better excuse than that.

02:13.269 --> 02:14.634
Sadly, no.

02:14.804 --> 02:16.135
Look, I'm really sorry, you guys.

02:17.139 --> 02:19.937
Don't worry, it was no biggie,
saving two seats in the front row.

02:20.109 --> 02:22.168
You know how sweet
and understanding hockey fans are.

02:22.344 --> 02:24.278
No, look, Sabrina's right.
It really was my fault.

02:24.447 --> 02:26.506
We got stuck at this dumb
boring work thing.

02:26.682 --> 02:28.547
Yeah, we had to meet people
at the Four Seasons,

02:28.717 --> 02:30.651
and it turned out
Adam Sandler was staying there,

02:30.820 --> 02:33.550
so we got to go up to his suite
and he was really funny.

02:34.924 --> 02:38.519
- In a dumb boring sort of way.
- Smooth.

02:38.694 --> 02:40.423
Look, you're not really mad,
are you, Kinkle?

02:40.596 --> 02:42.427
What do you play?
Like 80 games in a season?

02:42.598 --> 02:44.691
Oh, I'm cool.
I've got another one tomorrow.

02:44.867 --> 02:47.631
And I'm sure I can score
the winning goal two games in a row.

02:47.803 --> 02:49.634
We'll be there.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

02:49.805 --> 02:52.000
Uh, the world, no,
but a world premiere, yes.

02:52.174 --> 02:54.734
I was gonna surprise you with tickets
to the Boston Film Festival.

02:54.910 --> 02:57.105
Oh, I always wanted to...
How about Wednesday?

02:57.279 --> 03:00.077
Uh, Wednesday, you promised
to help me do my hair.

03:00.249 --> 03:01.773
- Can't Roxie help you?
- I'd love to.

03:01.951 --> 03:04.442
Except I already made plans with you
to try that new yoga place.

03:04.620 --> 03:06.144
And Harvey's coming with.

03:06.322 --> 03:08.415
Ooh, Wednesday, you know,
we gotta go to that thing...

03:08.591 --> 03:10.650
Yeah, I'll be there.
And there, and there.

03:10.826 --> 03:13.488
- What about me?
- And there, so there.

03:13.662 --> 03:16.563
Oh, let's say good night out there.

03:18.434 --> 03:20.902
Okay, Morgan on Tuesday,
I'm with Roxie Friday.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.901
Oh, Harvey's hockey game.

03:23.072 --> 03:25.632
I'll convince him to take up baseball.
I'm wide open in June.

03:25.808 --> 03:27.639
You know,
if you're having trouble scheduling,

03:27.810 --> 03:29.072
I make a great gal Friday.

03:29.245 --> 03:30.837
But I will need Fridays off.

03:31.013 --> 03:32.708
I've got everything
perfectly under control.

03:32.882 --> 03:35.407
I just need to do a little juggling.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.787
Then you have come
to the right place.

03:41.624 --> 03:44.593
Look, okay, I've always dreamed
of running off and joining the circus,

03:44.760 --> 03:47.957
but I never thought that the circus
would run off and join me.

03:48.130 --> 03:51.031
Mind telling me what you're doing here
and why I'm dressed like a skater?

03:51.200 --> 03:53.828
I've nothing but your interests
at heart, mademoiselle.

03:54.003 --> 03:57.404
I pitch my tent wherever
and whenever I find a witch

03:57.573 --> 04:00.269
whose life is seriously...

04:01.443 --> 04:02.876
...out of balance.

04:03.045 --> 04:05.036
Usually I'm the first
to beat a metaphor to death

04:05.214 --> 04:07.205
but, uh, my life is totally balanced.

04:07.383 --> 04:09.908
Something tells me otherwise.

04:10.085 --> 04:11.848
The only thing I'm trying
to balance right now

04:12.021 --> 04:13.386
are my friends
and my new boyfriend.

04:13.556 --> 04:14.716
I gave up on my checkbook.

04:14.890 --> 04:17.415
Well, then if your life is
as in balance as you say,

04:17.593 --> 04:21.051
you should have no trouble crossing
the tightrope while you juggle these.

04:21.230 --> 04:23.061
<i>The movies, Sabrina.</i>

04:24.600 --> 04:25.760
<i>My hair.</i>

04:27.269 --> 04:29.430
<i>Sabrina, yoga tomorrow.</i>

04:32.174 --> 04:34.233
<i>Hockey game.
- All right, jeez, I get it.</i>

04:34.410 --> 04:36.537
Obviously, the French
aren't masters of subtlety.

04:36.712 --> 04:38.680
You're crazy if you think
I'm going up on that tightrope.

04:41.016 --> 04:44.611
Unless I should happen to find myself
50 feet in the air with no way down.

04:45.554 --> 04:48.455
Maybe I am right,
maybe I am wrong.

04:48.624 --> 04:50.854
There is only one way to see.

04:51.560 --> 04:55.018
Great. A foreign double-talking
huckster with bad eyes.

04:55.197 --> 04:57.358
Well, I'll show you
my life's in balance.

04:57.533 --> 04:59.262
Prepare to be dazzled.

05:03.806 --> 05:04.830
Okay, not too bad.

05:07.409 --> 05:08.774
Hey, I'm actually pretty good at...

05:12.047 --> 05:13.742
Falling.

05:19.622 --> 05:21.954
You know, in my defense,
those balls were a little slippery.

05:22.124 --> 05:23.648
I mean,
Morgan uses tons of moisturizer.

05:23.826 --> 05:26.795
I do not think your slippery friend
is the problem.

05:27.363 --> 05:30.059
Okay, you know, maybe my life
is a little bit out of balance.

05:30.232 --> 05:31.790
But it shouldn't be too hard to fix.

05:31.967 --> 05:34.663
I hope not, because until you make it
to the far platform,

05:34.837 --> 05:37.397
Cirque du Sabrina is here to stay.

05:40.409 --> 05:42.900
Okay, nobody likes a show-off.

05:45.147 --> 05:48.446
Roxie, Morgan, get out here now.
House meeting.

05:48.617 --> 05:50.608
Oh, what's going on?

05:50.786 --> 05:52.777
I was just having that dream
where you're at school

05:52.955 --> 05:54.855
and you have to take a test
and you realize

05:55.024 --> 05:56.616
that you haven't dated the professor.

05:57.359 --> 05:59.327
Okay, look,
I can't keep juggling everyone.

05:59.495 --> 06:02.191
Morgan, you're gonna have to find
someone to help you with your hair.

06:02.364 --> 06:03.854
And Roxie,
I can't make yoga this week.

06:04.466 --> 06:06.730
I know it sounds harsh,
but it had to be said.

06:06.902 --> 06:09.803
You couldn't have waited
until the morning to say it?

06:09.972 --> 06:12.907
Well, I thought I might get
a better night's sleep if I said it now.

06:13.075 --> 06:15.202
Oh, as long as you get
a good night's sleep.

06:16.512 --> 06:17.570
Are we done here?

06:17.746 --> 06:20.010
Yeah, yeah. Meeting adjourned.

06:20.716 --> 06:24.049
If I have bags under my eyes
in the morning, she is so dead.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.720
Well, that was easy.

06:29.024 --> 06:31.891
Nothing is ever that easy.

06:36.331 --> 06:39.459
I wonder if you can fumigate
for circus folk.

06:40.903 --> 06:42.996
I can't believe I had to spend the night
on the couch

06:43.172 --> 06:44.662
just because the circus came to town.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.035
Juggling Jacques insists
that my life is out of balance

06:47.209 --> 06:48.471
when everything seems perfect.

06:48.644 --> 06:49.668
Mm-hm.

06:49.845 --> 06:52.473
What about Aaron,
the jealous boyfriend?

06:52.648 --> 06:54.741
What?
Aaron has nothing to be jealous of.

06:54.917 --> 06:57.477
What about your ex-boyfriend
always hanging around here?

06:57.653 --> 07:00.121
Harvey? That's ridiculous.
He's not always hanging around here.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.813
Hey, Sabrina. I'm out of coffee.

07:01.990 --> 07:03.150
You guys got any fresh?

07:03.325 --> 07:04.349
Huh.

07:04.526 --> 07:05.925
What? We make good coffee.

07:06.095 --> 07:09.030
No guy wants his girlfriend
hanging around with her ex.

07:09.198 --> 07:10.529
Trust me, I know these things.

07:10.699 --> 07:14.965
I'm a man, turned into a cat,
turned into a clown.

07:15.137 --> 07:16.161
Oh, kill me now.

07:17.940 --> 07:19.305
You guys got any half and half?

07:19.475 --> 07:20.635
Nope, just chocolate milk.

07:20.809 --> 07:23.369
- Even better.
- Oh, my...

07:25.080 --> 07:27.048
That's just what Harvey said.
"Oh, my... "

07:28.417 --> 07:30.248
Sabrina,
tell Morgan how great her hair looks.

07:30.419 --> 07:33.445
I mean, once I add the relaxer,
the toner, the neutralizer.

07:33.622 --> 07:34.646
The hat.

07:34.823 --> 07:37.951
Which you'll never need again
with such beautiful hair.

07:38.127 --> 07:42.393
Well, caffeine and chocolate beverage
craving satisfied, I'm out of here.

07:42.564 --> 07:44.031
See you, Sabrina.

07:44.199 --> 07:45.757
Bye, Roxie, Morgan.

07:45.934 --> 07:47.834
You're in my prayers.

07:48.003 --> 07:49.436
He is so sweet.

07:49.605 --> 07:51.266
Yeah, listen,
let me ask you something.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.431
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

07:53.609 --> 07:55.372
but do you think
there's any chance that Aaron

07:55.544 --> 07:57.102
might be slightly jealous of Harvey?

07:57.279 --> 08:00.737
- Uh, yeah.
- Even the cat could have told you that.

08:00.916 --> 08:02.713
Yeah, but I'm not gonna
take his word for it.

08:02.885 --> 08:06.548
I mean, uh, Aaron has never been
anything but nice to Harvey.

08:06.722 --> 08:09.054
Don't you ever notice whenever
Harvey comes up with a plan,

08:09.224 --> 08:11.158
Aaron immediately comes up
with a counter-plan?

08:11.326 --> 08:12.884
"Sabrina, I got you a surprise.

08:13.061 --> 08:14.289
Film festival tickets. "

08:14.463 --> 08:15.555
Not too obvious.

08:15.731 --> 08:18.256
Face it, you've got yourself
a jealous boyfriend.

08:18.433 --> 08:19.900
And unfortunately,

08:20.068 --> 08:22.536
jealousy is the worst quality
a boyfriend can have.

08:22.704 --> 08:23.898
Aside from poverty.

08:24.506 --> 08:28.135
Come on, there is no way Aaron
is even remotely jealous of Harvey.

08:28.777 --> 08:31.109
Of course I'm jealous of Harvey.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.407
Hey, give me a blue on four, Perry.

08:33.582 --> 08:36.210
But Harvey's my oldest friend.
I've known him for years.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.909
Yeah, and he was your boyfriend
for four of them.

08:39.087 --> 08:41.145
I mean, what would you say
if I kept dragging you off

08:41.323 --> 08:42.414
to one of my ex's hockey games?

08:42.591 --> 08:44.582
I'd say, is there something
you wanna tell me?

08:45.494 --> 08:49.021
Look, Harvey is so far past
being an ex, he's a Y.

08:49.198 --> 08:52.133
Look, say what you want.
I just don't like having him around.

08:52.301 --> 08:54.394
Hey, Perry, give me a red
on the three panel.

08:55.304 --> 08:58.330
Relationships are about compromise,
but this isn't one of those times.

08:58.507 --> 08:59.531
Harvey is my friend,

08:59.708 --> 09:01.300
and I don't think
I wanna be with someone

09:01.476 --> 09:03.239
who's gonna dictate
who I see and who I don't.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.970
You can't just order me around.

09:05.147 --> 09:07.138
- Oh, stand over there, will you?
- All right, sure.

09:07.316 --> 09:09.011
No. Listen.

09:09.184 --> 09:11.049
There is nothing going on
between me and Harvey.

09:11.220 --> 09:14.280
If you can't believe and get over it,
then I don't know what else I can say.

09:17.693 --> 09:19.126
I don't know how to get out of here.

09:20.028 --> 09:21.996
Thanks, Perry.

09:24.867 --> 09:26.960
Turns out
my problem isn't scheduling.

09:27.135 --> 09:29.535
My life is out of balance
because I have a jealous boyfriend.

09:29.705 --> 09:30.763
Ah, jealousy.

09:30.939 --> 09:34.102
It brings nothing but sorrow
and bad country-western songs.

09:34.576 --> 09:36.476
Anyway, I've taken care of it.
So I'm ready to...

09:37.679 --> 09:40.580
Would a little warning
be too much to ask?

09:43.652 --> 09:46.052
Hey, Ma, look at me.
I'm tightrope walking.

09:47.856 --> 09:49.756
Hey, Sabrina.
- Aaron.

09:49.925 --> 09:51.893
What?
I thought we already settled this.

09:52.060 --> 09:54.221
Hi, Sabrina.
- Harvey?

09:55.631 --> 09:57.292
Wait. Aah!

10:06.408 --> 10:07.932
What the heck was that all about?

10:08.110 --> 10:10.772
I do not think the jealous boyfriend
is your problem.

10:10.946 --> 10:12.106
Well, then what is?

10:13.482 --> 10:14.540
Me.

10:14.716 --> 10:16.445
I'm still in love with you, Sabrina.

10:25.894 --> 10:28.362
Why couldn't I have just gotten
a circus with some cotton candy

10:28.530 --> 10:30.020
and the occasional
rampaging elephant?

10:30.432 --> 10:31.729
Sabrina, what's wrong?

10:31.900 --> 10:33.492
Oh, Harvey's still in love with me.

10:33.669 --> 10:35.136
That's fantastic.

10:35.304 --> 10:36.430
What? No, it's not.

10:36.605 --> 10:40.166
Yes, it is. This kind of gossip
will keep Morgan distracted for hours.

10:40.342 --> 10:41.536
Come on, walk and talk.

10:41.710 --> 10:44.235
Roxie, this is a serious problem.

10:44.846 --> 10:46.780
Okay, I guess having your own
personal troll doll

10:46.949 --> 10:48.416
also qualifies as a problem, but...

10:48.884 --> 10:50.977
I know you said that I have to wait
until you're done,

10:51.153 --> 10:52.177
but I have got to look.

10:52.354 --> 10:53.946
Harvey's still in love with Sabrina.

10:54.456 --> 10:56.151
What? Get out.

10:56.325 --> 10:58.816
That's unbelievable.

10:58.994 --> 11:00.018
What was I just gonna do?

11:01.396 --> 11:03.296
I can't believe
I accused Aaron of being consumed

11:03.465 --> 11:05.797
by the green-eyed monster
when he was just being perceptive.

11:05.968 --> 11:07.230
Hello? Aaron.

11:07.402 --> 11:08.630
Wow, you really are perceptive.

11:08.804 --> 11:10.271
Listen, Sabrina,

11:10.439 --> 11:12.703
I'm really sorry
about this whole Harvey thing.

11:12.874 --> 11:14.705
You were completely right
about everything.

11:14.876 --> 11:17.709
Just my luck. I finally find a guy
who actually listens to me.

11:17.879 --> 11:19.870
And as proof of my sincerity,

11:20.048 --> 11:22.812
I just called Harvey and asked him
to join us at the club tonight.

11:22.985 --> 11:24.145
He loved the idea.

11:24.319 --> 11:25.809
Color me shocked.

11:25.988 --> 11:29.515
Anyway, I just wanted you to know
that I heard what you were saying

11:29.691 --> 11:30.715
and I'm sorry.

11:31.326 --> 11:34.454
Oh, you are
the greatest boyfriend ever.

11:34.629 --> 11:36.324
And I am the worst girlfriend ever.

11:36.498 --> 11:39.126
Sabrina, why are you getting
so worked up about this?

11:39.301 --> 11:40.563
This is Harvey's problem.

11:40.736 --> 11:43.000
It's not your fault
that he's not over you.

11:43.805 --> 11:45.898
Odd, but not your fault.

11:46.074 --> 11:47.098
Good point, Morgan.

11:47.275 --> 11:49.709
I mean, is anything
every really anyone's fault?

11:50.345 --> 11:53.781
You guys broke up years ago.
You can't control someone's feelings.

11:53.949 --> 11:55.280
You know, you're absolutely right.

11:55.450 --> 11:57.213
I have never been anything
but completely open

11:57.386 --> 11:58.410
and honest with Harvey.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.111
I've definitely never led him on.

12:00.288 --> 12:02.188
This isn't my problem.
This is Harvey's problem.

12:02.357 --> 12:03.654
The circus should be in his room.

12:05.293 --> 12:06.954
As the old saying goes.

12:08.630 --> 12:10.598
Oh, wait, now I remember
what I was going to do.

12:10.766 --> 12:13.633
You were gonna come with me
to find out Harvey's side of the story.

12:13.802 --> 12:15.736
While I work on mine.

12:17.639 --> 12:19.106
So you see, there's nothing I can do.

12:19.274 --> 12:21.299
I can't stop Harvey
from having feelings for me.

12:21.476 --> 12:23.774
You know, unless of course
I get Roxie to do my hair.

12:23.945 --> 12:26.004
Would you stop doing that?

12:27.416 --> 12:29.884
You say he cannot change
his feelings.

12:30.052 --> 12:32.316
But what if he never had
these feelings at all?

12:32.487 --> 12:34.478
Oh, that's just crazy circus talk.

12:34.656 --> 12:37.591
No, it's not.
That's exactly what I need to do.

12:37.759 --> 12:38.851
How exactly would I do that?

12:39.027 --> 12:43.794
The feelings that upset you today
are connected to those from yesterday.

12:43.965 --> 12:47.833
And the day before that,
and the day before that.

12:48.003 --> 12:50.938
Look,
I'm not still in love with Sabrina.

12:51.106 --> 12:52.130
She's a good friend.

12:52.307 --> 12:54.741
I care about her a lot,
but that's as far as it goes.

12:55.444 --> 12:56.570
So, what's the damage?

12:56.745 --> 12:59.475
Damage? There's no damage.
Morgan just felt like wearing a scarf.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.208
No, what do we owe?

13:03.318 --> 13:04.478
Ah!

13:04.653 --> 13:09.420
And it seems our Kinkle
truly doth protest too much.

13:09.591 --> 13:10.888
Just good friends, huh?

13:11.059 --> 13:13.186
Do you carry around pictures
of all your friends?

13:13.361 --> 13:14.794
No, it's just...

13:16.465 --> 13:18.524
The last photo of me
with all my real teeth.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.565
You catch the puck with your face
a dozen times,

13:20.735 --> 13:22.760
you start remembering
to wear your mouthguard.

13:23.371 --> 13:24.599
Harvey.

13:24.773 --> 13:27.537
Okay.
It was our first Valentine's Day.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.802
We were young and at the mall.

13:29.978 --> 13:31.775
I had a pocket full of quarters.

13:31.947 --> 13:34.643
- Give me that.
- Ha-ha-ha.

13:37.652 --> 13:41.144
And the day before that,
and the day before that...

13:41.323 --> 13:43.223
Good thing I didn't meet Harvey
in grade school.

13:43.892 --> 13:46.326
All leading back to the day

13:46.495 --> 13:49.862
when that first spark of love
was ignited.

13:56.872 --> 14:00.535
Oh, that was my first day at school
and the first time I ever saw Harvey.

14:00.709 --> 14:01.903
Could I get that on DVD?

14:02.077 --> 14:04.637
The director is still recording
his commentary.

14:04.813 --> 14:08.715
The question is,
what shall we do with this moment?

14:08.884 --> 14:10.408
Well, I'd like to keep it.

14:10.585 --> 14:12.177
If that's throwing my life
out of balance,

14:12.354 --> 14:13.912
I can imagine
what it's doing to Harvey.

14:14.089 --> 14:17.889
Are you positive you want
Harvey's feelings for you to disappear?

14:18.059 --> 14:19.321
I don't have any other choice.

14:22.664 --> 14:24.928
Voilà. Impressive, no?

14:25.100 --> 14:27.694
Uh, not really.
I'm a witch, remember?

14:29.437 --> 14:32.031
Sabrina, wait. Ha.
You gotta see this.

14:32.207 --> 14:33.731
Ah, squeeze my nose.

14:33.909 --> 14:36.104
Does this end any differently
than "pull my tail"?

14:36.278 --> 14:38.007
Oh, you've heard it.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.943
But what you haven't heard
is that yours truly

14:40.115 --> 14:42.606
scored a date
with one of the contortionists.

14:42.784 --> 14:44.843
Oh, just like you
to turn my personal tragedy

14:45.020 --> 14:46.419
into your romantic opportunity.

14:46.588 --> 14:48.715
Yup. Everybody wins.

14:50.091 --> 14:53.583
I won't know if I've won until I find out
if Harvey's still love struck.

14:53.995 --> 14:56.327
Hey, Sabrina, I thought I'd swing by
on the way to the club.

14:56.498 --> 14:58.898
Great.
Harvey's gonna be there, right?

15:00.368 --> 15:02.529
He's gotta be here somewhere.
You did invite him, right?

15:02.704 --> 15:05.298
Oh, yeah,
and barring a disfiguring accident,

15:05.473 --> 15:06.633
he should be here.

15:06.808 --> 15:09.709
Hey, Aaron,
thanks for putting me on the list.

15:09.878 --> 15:11.368
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

15:11.546 --> 15:15.380
Hey, why would I go anywhere
when Harvey's here?

15:15.550 --> 15:17.211
Hey, Harvey.

15:17.619 --> 15:19.610
Oh, hey, Spellman.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.688
So how you've been?

15:22.123 --> 15:24.148
Uh, fine, I guess.

15:24.326 --> 15:26.590
Okay, well, I just wanted to do
a little check, you know.

15:26.761 --> 15:29.286
See how you're doing,
see how you're feeling about us.

15:29.464 --> 15:33.127
I didn't realize there was anything
between us to feel anything about.

15:33.301 --> 15:34.461
Nice chatting.

15:35.136 --> 15:36.398
All right, mission accomplished.

15:36.571 --> 15:39.369
No one's ever gonna accuse you
of being love struck.

15:39.708 --> 15:42.040
Or polite. I guess I'll see you
at your game tomorrow.

15:42.577 --> 15:44.977
Wait, you're coming to my game?

15:45.513 --> 15:47.242
Of course, I always do.

15:47.415 --> 15:49.042
Wait a minute.
We're still friends, right?

15:49.584 --> 15:50.744
Still?

15:50.919 --> 15:52.113
I didn't think we ever were.

15:52.287 --> 15:55.916
In fact, I don't think we ever said
two words to each other in high school.

15:56.424 --> 15:58.051
Harvey, quit playing around.

15:58.226 --> 16:00.820
I don't think
I'm the one who's playing.

16:03.665 --> 16:06.793
What did she do?
Slip this in my wallet?

16:06.968 --> 16:08.697
Psycho.

16:14.876 --> 16:17.538
And it was like this photo
meant nothing to him.

16:17.712 --> 16:18.906
<i>Je suis confused.</i>

16:19.080 --> 16:25.178
I thought you wanted Harvey's feelings
for you to be snuffed out.

16:25.453 --> 16:27.182
Well, I wanted
his romantic feelings snuffed.

16:27.355 --> 16:29.289
I didn't want to snuff out
our entire friendship.

16:29.457 --> 16:31.049
I can't imagine my life
without Harvey.

16:31.226 --> 16:33.285
<i>And you are telling me this
pourquoi?</i>

16:33.461 --> 16:35.554
Uh, because I need to know
how to do your hankie trick

16:35.730 --> 16:37.789
<i>to put Harvey's feelings back,
that's pourquoi.</i>

16:37.966 --> 16:39.194
I'm a witch, remember?

16:39.367 --> 16:41.426
You know, if you undo this spell,

16:41.603 --> 16:43.901
your life will be out of balance again.

16:44.072 --> 16:46.472
I thought the circus was
supposed to put a smile on your face.

16:46.641 --> 16:48.905
You are confusing us with a carnival.
I spit on the carnival.

16:50.712 --> 16:52.976
And my shoes.

17:01.923 --> 17:03.754
- Ta-da.
- Nice.

17:04.326 --> 17:05.953
It's a little Vegas for you, isn't it?

17:06.127 --> 17:07.753
Vegas, but hopefully effective.

17:08.663 --> 17:10.756
Hey, are you coming
to my game tomorrow?

17:10.932 --> 17:14.367
Jackpot. Yeah, uh, well, you know,
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

17:15.537 --> 17:18.904
Oh, Harvey, I found this.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.299
Hey, I keep the same one
in my wallet.

17:21.476 --> 17:23.068
I know. It's yours.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.576
Because it's my best haircut.

17:25.747 --> 17:27.578
I show it to barbers all the time.

17:27.749 --> 17:30.343
Oh, it's okay. That was one
of the best days of my life.

17:30.518 --> 17:32.816
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

17:32.987 --> 17:34.784
But that was a long time ago.

17:35.523 --> 17:37.081
I know.

17:37.325 --> 17:39.190
Look, I know we broke up
a while ago,

17:39.361 --> 17:43.889
but, to be honest, my feelings for you
never really changed.

17:44.466 --> 17:46.400
I know, but you have to let
those feelings evolve.

17:46.568 --> 17:48.399
Otherwise, we'll never be able
to move forward.

17:48.570 --> 17:50.902
And I might never be able
to move across my bedroom again.

17:51.506 --> 17:53.599
Easier said than done.

17:53.775 --> 17:56.505
But why now?
And why is this happening with Aaron?

17:56.678 --> 17:58.043
I've dated other guys.

17:58.213 --> 18:00.078
Yeah, I know.

18:00.248 --> 18:03.217
But, you never seemed
this serious before.

18:03.385 --> 18:06.354
Yeah, you're right.
It is different with Aaron.

18:06.521 --> 18:08.489
Well, I wish
I could be happy for you,

18:08.656 --> 18:11.147
but I don't know
if I'm that good of a sport.

18:11.726 --> 18:13.353
Harvey, what are you saying?

18:13.528 --> 18:16.622
I'm saying, I don't think I can do this.

18:16.798 --> 18:18.629
Well, Harvey, wait.

18:20.769 --> 18:23.465
I guess he won't mind if I keep this.

18:24.806 --> 18:26.671
Oh, you know, just once
I'd love to come in here

18:26.841 --> 18:28.365
and find your head in a lion's mouth.

18:28.543 --> 18:30.477
Anyway,
I finally got my life in balance.

18:30.645 --> 18:33.011
So you put down those balls
and watch me zip across the rope

18:33.181 --> 18:35.172
to the far platform
so I can send you packing.

18:35.350 --> 18:38.945
I'm sensing more bitterness than
usual in your sweet, bossy nature.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.486
Well, good.
I was afraid I was being too subtle.

18:41.656 --> 18:43.920
You know, I didn't realize
that putting my life in balance

18:44.092 --> 18:45.491
would mean losing Harvey forever.

18:45.660 --> 18:48.026
I'm sorry to hear that, mademoiselle.

18:48.196 --> 18:49.220
Thanks.

18:49.397 --> 18:51.888
You know,
it's really kind of hard to imagine...

18:52.267 --> 18:54.827
Could I please
just finish a sentence?

18:55.003 --> 18:56.095
Hey, where's the net?

18:56.838 --> 19:00.899
If your life truly is in balance,
you won't need the net.

19:01.075 --> 19:02.770
Oh, easy to say from the floor.

19:04.879 --> 19:07.245
Okay, I can do this.

19:07.649 --> 19:08.843
Don't look down.

19:10.852 --> 19:12.786
Remember to breathe.

19:12.954 --> 19:14.717
No, don't breathe.

19:14.889 --> 19:16.481
More steps.

19:19.594 --> 19:21.152
Harvey?

19:21.629 --> 19:22.891
What are you doing here?

19:25.233 --> 19:27.201
You didn't think I'd let you fall,
did you?

19:27.368 --> 19:28.926
I don't know. I guess I...

19:31.739 --> 19:32.933
Well, I'll say one thing.

19:33.107 --> 19:35.837
Nobody retreats faster
than the French.

19:36.010 --> 19:38.069
I am just saying,
I think a lot of people would watch

19:38.246 --> 19:40.976
an action-adventure movie
where a circus gets blown up.

19:41.149 --> 19:42.514
Repeatedly.

19:42.684 --> 19:45.312
I'm definitely picking the videos
from now on.

19:45.487 --> 19:46.886
So you talk to Harvey lately?

19:47.055 --> 19:48.079
No, not really.

19:48.256 --> 19:51.089
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Kind of.

19:51.259 --> 19:53.819
No, I have had it up to here
with your excuses.

19:53.995 --> 19:56.190
"Don't look at it.
The sun might melt it.

19:56.364 --> 19:57.388
Water might break it. "

19:57.565 --> 19:59.590
And now,
we accidentally find ourselves

19:59.767 --> 20:01.257
at a Hair Club for Men meeting?

20:01.436 --> 20:03.836
Forget it. I am looking.

20:04.038 --> 20:07.269
In my defense,
I had no idea what I was doing.

20:08.376 --> 20:11.277
See? I've already found the two clowns
to star in my circus movie.

20:12.580 --> 20:14.138
I love it.

20:14.549 --> 20:16.073
- You do?
- Yes.

20:16.251 --> 20:20.347
And it's only fair
that I return the favor and do yours.

20:20.522 --> 20:23.423
- Oh, that's really not necessary.
- Oh, yes it is.

20:25.159 --> 20:27.787
The only way that could end
is in tears.

20:31.065 --> 20:32.794
- Harvey.
- Hey.

20:32.967 --> 20:36.027
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for walking off yesterday.

20:36.204 --> 20:38.138
That's all right. I understand.

20:38.573 --> 20:40.973
I don't know if my feelings
will ever evolve like you said,

20:41.142 --> 20:44.168
but regardless I want you to know
that I'll always be there for you

20:44.345 --> 20:45.437
if you need me.

20:45.813 --> 20:47.940
Thanks. That means a lot to me.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.516
Well, you wanna come in?
Aaron and I are about to watch a movie.

20:50.685 --> 20:52.653
Get away from me!

20:52.820 --> 20:54.378
Or a murder.

20:54.989 --> 20:56.388
Hey, Harvey.

20:56.558 --> 20:57.752
Hey.

20:57.926 --> 20:59.826
You know, maybe another time.

20:59.994 --> 21:01.552
I'll catch you later.

21:02.830 --> 21:05.025
And I know you always will.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.398
But maybe next time
I won't be wearing sequins.

21:11.239 --> 21:13.173
Little help?

21:13.341 --> 21:14.501
- Oh.
- Whoa.

21:16.210 --> 21:17.939
Bad date
with the contortionist, huh?

21:18.112 --> 21:20.808
Are you kidding?
Best date of my life.

21:21.382 --> 21:22.940
Well, you always were
a little twisted.

21:25.186 --> 21:26.778
- Oh, boy.
- Ha, ha.
