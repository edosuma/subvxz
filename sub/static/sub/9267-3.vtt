Let's talk about
what happens in your body

11:51.501 --> 11:53.102
when you consume alcohol.

11:53.136 --> 11:55.805
One or two drinks

11:55.839 --> 11:58.641
can impair your reasoning
and emotions,

11:58.676 --> 12:02.446
which means you can decide
to do some dumb things

12:02.480 --> 12:03.980

As more alcohol
is consumed in the body,

12:07.184 --> 12:09.786
your vision and speech
are impaired,

12:09.820 --> 12:12.789
as well as your reflexes
and balance.

12:12.823 --> 12:15.458

21:55.579 --> 21:58.781
"Caesar was everyone...
every woman's man..."

21:58.816 --> 22:01.284
"And every man's woman."
Yes, you've used that quote

22:01.318 --> 22:03.719
five times in the past week,
every time we go out.

22:03.754 --> 22:05.488
Well, no wonder
you stole my line.

22:05.523 --> 22:06.823
I did not steal your line.

22:06.857 --> 22:09.225
Unless you are the 17th century
Earl of Oxford.

22:09.259 --> 22:10.860
Oh, de vere?
Oh, please.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.896
He is such a poser.
13th folio?

22:13.930 --> 22:16.365
Maybe in his dreams.

22:16.399 --> 22:19.100
[Overlapping chatter,
dinner music]

22:20.369 --> 22:23.871
Anyway, I just adore Alison.

22:23.906 --> 22:26.074
I hear she's doing
such wonderful work

22:26.108 --> 22:28.309
on her sabbatical in Boston.

22:28.344 --> 22:30.912
- Yes, she is.
- You must be so proud

22:30.946 --> 22:33.348
so have such a distinguished
wife, yeah?

22:35.351 --> 22:37.286
There's Professor Nevins.

22:37.320 --> 22:39.389
I'm gonna tell him about...
[Voice fades]

22:39.423 --> 22:42.158
[Overlapping chatter]

22:45.997 --> 22:48.331
You're gonna want to get
real familiar with bleach,

22:48.366 --> 22:50.066
'cause that's the one thing
that's gonna keep these

22:50.101 --> 22:51.668
- staph infections from going...
- Hey, Foxy Brown.

22:51.702 --> 22:53.937
Keep it in your pants, Tinker!

22:53.971 --> 22:56.339
There's staph infections
in here?

22:56.373 --> 22:58.842
Yeah. It's a locker room.
Okay. All right.

22:58.876 --> 23:01.878
Hey, everybody listen up!
This is Jess...

23:01.912 --> 23:03.079
Merriweather.

23:03.113 --> 23:04.947
Jess Merriweather, all right?

23:04.981 --> 23:06.916
She's the new equipment
manager with us.

23:06.951 --> 23:09.185
I expect y'all to treat her
with the same respect

23:09.220 --> 23:11.188
that you do me, all right?

23:11.222 --> 23:13.290
What's that?
Hey, you mean none?

23:13.324 --> 23:15.158
[Laughter]

23:15.192 --> 23:17.994
Shut your face, Moreno!

23:18.029 --> 23:19.862
You're good.

23:19.897 --> 23:21.330
Thanks.

23:21.365 --> 23:24.433
So this is you
on the team, Laundry?

23:24.468 --> 23:26.968
Well, yeah, because
I'm the equipment manager.

23:27.003 --> 23:28.870
This is the equipment
that I manage.

23:28.904 --> 23:30.438
Thanks!

23:30.473 --> 23:33.141
Hey, focus, focus.
This isn't gonna work.

23:33.175 --> 23:34.775
I just... I just don't...
I don't see this...

23:34.810 --> 23:37.478
I get to wear
a uniform and hats

23:37.512 --> 23:39.379
and, like, stuff like y'all...
Isn't that cool?

23:39.414 --> 23:41.448
Mm-hmm. You can't wait
till everybody leaves?

23:41.482 --> 23:43.551
Can you take those off too

23:43.585 --> 23:45.119
so I can get your uniform
going, baby?

23:45.153 --> 23:47.455
But I'm gonna start on this,
because I gotta lot of stuff...

23:47.489 --> 23:48.789
I don't know about this, Jess.

23:48.824 --> 23:51.359
Okay, mwah, babe.
I'll see you later.

23:51.393 --> 23:52.827
Later, babe.
[Kissing sounds]

23:59.002 --> 24:01.737
[Girl giggling]

24:01.772 --> 24:03.272
Excuse me.

24:03.306 --> 24:05.640
Oh, God!
[Laughing]

24:05.675 --> 24:07.576
- Good lord.
- Oh, man!

24:07.610 --> 24:09.877
[Laughing]

24:11.780 --> 24:13.614
Fancy meeting you here.

24:15.350 --> 24:17.384
Hi!
[Laughing]

24:18.853 --> 24:20.486
Let me just give you
a little perspective

24:20.521 --> 24:21.554
about something.

24:21.589 --> 24:23.923
You were in a supply closet.

24:23.958 --> 24:25.792
That's where they keep mops

24:25.826 --> 24:28.795
and brooms
and computer paper and...

24:28.829 --> 24:30.764
There's some rats in there.

24:30.799 --> 24:33.667
Isn't that romantic?

24:33.702 --> 24:37.506
This is gonna get around
now, too.

24:37.540 --> 24:38.807
And before you know it,

24:38.841 --> 24:40.776
you're gonna have yourself
quite a reputation.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.845
Is that what you want?

24:42.879 --> 24:44.580
'Cause I happen to know
you're smart

24:44.614 --> 24:47.883
and I can see
that you're beautiful,

24:47.918 --> 24:49.218
and this is a time right now

24:49.252 --> 24:51.788
for you to choose
what your future is.

24:51.822 --> 24:53.022
And it's not just gonna be

24:53.056 --> 24:54.590
people around this school
talking

24:54.624 --> 24:56.625
and your friends talking.

24:56.659 --> 24:58.460
It's gonna be parents talking.

24:58.495 --> 25:01.463
It's gonna be college
admissions officers talking.

25:01.498 --> 25:04.867
So really think about
what you want, all right?

25:19.749 --> 25:22.084
- What's happening?
- Where'd you get the car?

25:22.119 --> 25:24.086
Friend of mine.

25:24.121 --> 25:27.157
Gotta get it back
by midnight, you know.

25:27.191 --> 25:28.758
'Fore it turn into
a paddy wagon.

25:28.792 --> 25:30.326
[Chuckling]

25:30.361 --> 25:32.929
I must have
just missed you earlier.

25:32.963 --> 25:34.197
You know, I went down

25:34.231 --> 25:36.299
to get some tickets
for your game on Friday.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.334
- You went to my school?
- Yeah, man.

25:38.369 --> 25:40.670
Don't be going down there
lookin' for me.

25:40.704 --> 25:42.105
Hey, hey, come on, now.

25:42.139 --> 25:44.307
Your mama said you were
like superman out there.

25:44.341 --> 25:47.944
I want to see you play, son.

25:47.979 --> 25:50.080
I'll be a'ight.

25:50.114 --> 25:52.182
Hey, hey, come on.
Hop in, hop in.

25:52.216 --> 25:53.816
We'll go get your mama at work,

25:53.851 --> 25:57.253
we'll get something to eat,
some ray's barbecue.

25:57.287 --> 25:59.722
Come on, man.

25:59.757 --> 26:02.291
Y'all go ahead and enjoy that.

26:02.326 --> 26:04.027
Come on, son.
You gotta eat, right?

26:04.061 --> 26:06.529
I'll be a'ight.

26:06.563 --> 26:08.765
You know,
I'm in this position where

26:08.799 --> 26:10.767
everyone thinks
that I'm married,

26:10.801 --> 26:13.369
but I don't feel like I am.

26:13.404 --> 26:15.705
Is that why you don't
wear a wedding ring?

26:17.841 --> 26:19.175
I'm sorry.
You know what?

26:19.210 --> 26:20.944
This is none of my business.

26:20.978 --> 26:23.947
- This is none of my business.
- No, you know what, it's okay.

26:23.981 --> 26:26.516
It's kind of liberating
to talk about it,

26:26.550 --> 26:29.152
to hear it out loud.

26:29.186 --> 26:30.854
You know what,
we have some issues.

26:30.888 --> 26:33.223
Everyone in my life thinks
that we're happily married

26:33.257 --> 26:34.658
and that everything's great,

26:34.692 --> 26:37.260
but she's been gone
for six months on sabbatical,

26:37.295 --> 26:39.329
and how are we supposed
to work on our issues

26:39.363 --> 26:42.132
if we're not even together?

26:42.166 --> 26:43.933
I probably shouldn't
have said any of that.

26:43.968 --> 26:46.002
I've had too much to drink.

26:46.036 --> 26:47.270
It's okay.

26:47.304 --> 26:51.674
I promise that
I will not tell a soul.

26:53.977 --> 26:56.179
You're an awesome girl,
Julie Taylor.

26:56.213 --> 27:01.083
In a different world,
different time...

27:03.520 --> 27:04.687
Suffice it to say,

27:04.721 --> 27:06.888
I feel very comfortable
around you.

27:06.923 --> 27:09.591
I hope it's okay
that I said that.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.828
Yeah, it's...
It's flattering.

27:13.862 --> 27:16.496
[Laughs]

27:16.531 --> 27:17.965
Good.

27:23.137 --> 27:25.039
Okay.

27:25.073 --> 27:27.542
Good night

27:27.576 --> 27:29.911
to you.

27:31.915 --> 27:33.916
Good night.

27:33.950 --> 27:35.251
I'm gonna try that again

27:35.285 --> 27:37.120
and see if I can get
my legs to work.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.890
[Giggles]

27:39.925 --> 27:42.627
It's been a lovely evening.

27:42.661 --> 27:47.065
You know what you said about...

27:47.099 --> 27:49.100
Taking chances?

27:49.135 --> 27:50.835
Yeah.

29:04.143 --> 29:07.145
The short part of your tie's
a little long, man.

29:07.180 --> 29:10.815
You learn about ties
in the joint?

29:10.850 --> 29:13.786
Uh-huh. You must have
took a tie class.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.755
That's where your ass been
the last few years. Ha.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.557
Don't worry about
where I learned it.

29:18.591 --> 29:19.858
I learned it.

29:19.893 --> 29:21.826
- I don't care.
- That's enough, Vince.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.495
No, no, no.

29:23.529 --> 29:26.330
It's okay.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.665
Come on.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.367
Say what you need to say.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.302
You don't get it, do you?

29:31.337 --> 29:33.404
We been doing just fine
without you.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.073
And you come in here
and you expect us

29:35.107 --> 29:37.709
to act like everything's cool,
but it's not.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.244
You ain't been here for us.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.845
And if I had anything
to say about it,

29:40.880 --> 29:42.647
your ass wouldn't even
be in this house.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.582
Hold up.
You gonna drop bombs?

29:44.616 --> 29:46.417
- Oh!
- I got this.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.487
You gonna drop bombs
and run like a little kid?

29:49.522 --> 29:53.025
Your house?

29:53.059 --> 29:55.794
You want to talk like a man,
we can do that.

29:58.031 --> 30:02.168
A man don't leave his family.

30:02.202 --> 30:06.106
Is that talkin' like a man?

30:06.140 --> 30:08.008
And don't come
to my game tonight.

30:18.921 --> 30:21.423
Vince, wait.

30:21.458 --> 30:23.859
Vince, wait.

30:23.893 --> 30:25.694
Wait!

30:25.728 --> 30:27.863
Give him a chance.

30:27.897 --> 30:29.597
Okay, we give it a chance.
Then what?

30:29.631 --> 30:31.565
He starts robbing.
He starts stealing.

30:31.599 --> 30:33.067
He'll end up
right back in prison.

30:33.101 --> 30:36.236
Okay, then do it for me.

30:36.270 --> 30:40.706
Give him a chance for me.

30:40.741 --> 30:41.841
Okay?

30:43.844 --> 30:45.612
Let's be a family.

30:47.448 --> 30:49.349

31:32.663 --> 31:34.330
- For what?
- I don't know.

31:34.364 --> 31:36.965
Didn't say.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.033
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

31:46.742 --> 31:48.209
What's up?

31:48.243 --> 31:52.146
You left the grocery store
early. Why?

31:52.181 --> 31:53.681
Why not?

31:56.218 --> 31:58.719
Go ahead, say it.
Say what's on your mind.

31:58.754 --> 31:59.987
Well, first of all,
you didn't ask me

32:00.021 --> 32:02.123
how I felt
about Jess bein' on the team.

32:02.157 --> 32:03.357
Being in the locker room.

32:03.391 --> 32:04.959
I don't run personnel
decisions by you.

32:04.994 --> 32:06.661
And all these new rules.
They're stupid.

32:06.696 --> 32:08.797
This shirt, this tie,
and whatever high standards

32:08.831 --> 32:10.532
you're lookin' for,
this ain't it.

32:10.567 --> 32:12.568
Close that door.

32:12.603 --> 32:13.936
Close that door.

32:26.551 --> 32:29.353
When I first met you,

32:29.388 --> 32:32.390
you were climbing out of
a police car.

32:32.424 --> 32:34.792
People said you were a punk

32:34.827 --> 32:36.360
and you'd never last
on the field.

32:36.395 --> 32:38.096
You know
they still believe that?

32:38.131 --> 32:39.364
Screw them.

32:39.399 --> 32:41.900
I work hard
for everything I've done.

32:41.934 --> 32:44.168
I know you do, and you
oughta be damn proud about that.

32:44.203 --> 32:46.604
I am.

32:46.639 --> 32:48.072
I'm proud of you.

32:48.107 --> 32:50.908
Your teammates are proud of you.

32:53.778 --> 32:57.546
It's about character.

32:57.581 --> 33:01.950
It's about striving to be better
than everybody else.

33:06.989 --> 33:10.525
Coach, my dad
just got out of prison.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.261
He's staying with me
at my house.

33:13.296 --> 33:16.465
And I can't stand him.

33:16.499 --> 33:20.168
My mom,
she asked me to forgive him.

33:20.203 --> 33:22.338
To be better.

33:22.372 --> 33:26.075
And you're asking me
to be better.

33:26.109 --> 33:29.479
I don't know how to be better
'cause he never taught me how!

33:29.514 --> 33:32.049
He never taught me
how to be better!

33:32.083 --> 33:34.452
- He's not around!
- Hey, coach, we're going out.

33:34.486 --> 33:36.121
- Ten minutes.
- Fine, coach.

33:36.155 --> 33:38.824
- I'm supposed to be better!
- Close that door.

33:43.663 --> 33:45.097
Listen to me.

33:45.131 --> 33:48.600
I've said you need to strive

33:48.635 --> 33:51.736
to be better
than everyone else.

33:51.771 --> 33:54.406
I didn't say
you needed to be better

33:54.440 --> 33:57.208
than everyone else.

33:57.242 --> 33:59.443
But you gotta try.

33:59.477 --> 34:02.312
And that's what character is.

34:02.346 --> 34:05.616
It's in the trying.

34:11.222 --> 34:13.824
I'm gonna give you a few minutes
to gather yourself up here.

34:32.846 --> 34:34.214
47 tiger x tracer fade.
Hastings beat it.

34:34.248 --> 34:35.315
I'm gonna hit you
on the second window.

34:35.349 --> 34:36.650
It's coming in hot.
Be ready.

34:36.684 --> 34:38.585
Let's do this, a'ight?
On one. Ready?

34:38.620 --> 34:40.154
All: Break.

34:40.188 --> 34:42.956
Late in the fourth quarter,
the Lions down by a touchdown.

34:42.991 --> 34:45.458
But they are still
in this game, folks.

34:45.493 --> 34:48.195
Howard to the line, looking
to get something started.

34:51.632 --> 34:54.167
Vince Howard
is taking no prisoners

34:54.201 --> 34:57.036
and finding Hastings
for another Lions first down.

34:58.872 --> 35:00.940
- Hike!
- Howard takes the snap.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.374
Looking for a receiver.

35:02.409 --> 35:04.577
Oh, he's gonna
keep it on a scramble.

35:04.611 --> 35:06.345
- Take him out!
- Right there!

35:06.379 --> 35:09.448
Breaks the tackle.

35:09.482 --> 35:12.284
Gain of 12, and the Lions
are knockin' on the door.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.052
Howard drops.

35:14.086 --> 35:15.820
He throws.
He's got Russell.

35:15.854 --> 35:18.823
Touchdown!
An unbelievable pass!

35:18.857 --> 35:21.993
It's the Vince Howard show,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:22.027 --> 35:23.227
With a minute and a half to go,

35:23.262 --> 35:24.696
the Lions
have tied this ball game.

35:24.730 --> 35:26.331
Defense!

35:26.366 --> 35:28.299
Defense!

35:28.334 --> 35:32.038
[Chanting]
Defense! Defense!

35:32.072 --> 35:34.741
Comin' down to it, folks.
Dillon needs a stop.

35:34.775 --> 35:37.944
There's the snap.
Dragons are back.

35:37.979 --> 35:40.380
Cafferty's got a lane.
Big lick... boom!

35:40.415 --> 35:42.916
Ball is out.
Fumble!

35:42.950 --> 35:44.284
Yeah!

35:44.318 --> 35:45.619
The ball is loose.
I don't know who's on it.

35:45.653 --> 35:47.721
Looks like Tinker fell on it.

35:47.755 --> 35:50.323
[Blows whistle]

35:50.358 --> 35:54.660
It's official, folks.
Lion's ball!

35:54.694 --> 35:57.496
Under a minute to go, folks,
and there is life!

35:57.530 --> 35:59.765
There is life in East Dillon.

36:02.268 --> 36:04.302
Okay, watch him, watch him.
Let's go, guys.

36:10.143 --> 36:11.643
Ready!

36:14.213 --> 36:16.047
Set!

36:18.050 --> 36:19.885
Hut!

36:19.919 --> 36:22.420
Howard in the pocket.

36:22.454 --> 36:25.122
He's got 88, Ruckle,
open over the middle.

36:25.157 --> 36:26.857
Complete.

36:26.891 --> 36:28.624
That is in bounds.
Time's still winding.

36:28.659 --> 36:31.860
The Lions are gonna
have to hurry.

36:31.895 --> 36:34.296
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

36:34.330 --> 36:36.431
Here we go, on the 20.
40 seconds left,

36:36.465 --> 36:38.198
and Vince Howard has been

36:38.233 --> 36:40.033
carrying this team
on his shoulders all night.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.468
He's got one last shot.

36:42.503 --> 36:43.969
Let's go!
Pick it up!

36:44.004 --> 36:46.572
Ready. Set.

36:46.606 --> 36:47.573
Hut!

36:47.608 --> 36:50.176
Pick it up!

37:02.790 --> 37:04.424
Touchdown, Lions!

37:04.458 --> 37:06.659
Lions win!

37:06.693 --> 37:09.128
Vince "get the hell
outta my way" Howard

37:09.162 --> 37:10.763
has lit up this field tonight.

37:10.797 --> 37:13.066
What a show by this young man.

37:13.100 --> 37:16.002
The Lions are 3 and 0.
What do you know?

37:16.036 --> 37:19.439
They call that
the Tinker shuffle.

37:19.473 --> 37:21.741
Gets 'em a flag
for excessive celebration,

37:21.776 --> 37:23.410
but you can't really
blame these kids.

37:23.444 --> 37:25.679
Another big night.

37:25.713 --> 37:28.982
Another big win
for these East Dillon Lions.

37:29.016 --> 37:30.984
Hey.

37:31.018 --> 37:33.119
That was a hell of an effort.

37:33.154 --> 37:34.854
Hell of an effort.

37:34.888 --> 37:36.456
I ain't got nothing left,
coach.

37:36.490 --> 37:37.557
That's character, Vince.

37:43.664 --> 37:45.465
3 and 0!
3 and 0, man!

37:45.499 --> 37:47.034
3 and 0!

37:47.068 --> 37:49.269
We got it!
Let's go!

37:49.303 --> 37:52.072
[Cheering]

37:52.106 --> 37:53.507
East side, baby!

37:53.541 --> 37:55.876
East side!

37:55.910 --> 37:58.045
Give it up.
Give it up.

37:58.079 --> 38:01.381
You see it?
There it is.

38:02.683 --> 38:05.352
[All chanting]
3 and 0, East side!

38:05.386 --> 38:07.154
3 and 0, East side!

38:07.188 --> 38:10.224
3 and 0, East side!

38:10.258 --> 38:12.826
3 and 0, East side.

38:12.861 --> 38:15.195
3 and 0, East side.

38:15.229 --> 38:18.031
3 and 0, East side.

38:18.065 --> 38:21.435
[Telephone rings]

38:26.241 --> 38:28.775
- Hello?
- Pam.

38:28.810 --> 38:30.243
Yeah.

38:30.278 --> 38:33.513
This is what I've decided.

38:33.548 --> 38:35.515
Send Buddy junior
home to Dillon.

38:35.549 --> 38:38.185
He needs his father.

38:38.219 --> 38:39.887
Are you sure?

38:39.921 --> 38:43.724
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

38:43.759 --> 38:47.228
Send my son home, Pam.

38:47.262 --> 38:50.197
Thank you.

38:58.541 --> 39:00.542
Hey.

39:00.576 --> 39:02.444
Hey.

39:02.479 --> 39:03.779
You okay?

39:03.814 --> 39:07.050
Yeah. Feelin' good.

39:07.084 --> 39:10.487
I'm really sorry.

39:10.521 --> 39:11.922
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

39:11.956 --> 39:13.290
No, no, there is.

39:13.324 --> 39:15.559
I mean, I shouldn't
have let that happen.

39:15.594 --> 39:17.695
I'm a teacher.
You're a student.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.631
It wasn't a good idea.

39:19.665 --> 39:23.535
Right. No, I-I-I
totally agree with you.

39:25.237 --> 39:27.171
So we're good then.

39:27.206 --> 39:28.839
Yeah.

39:28.874 --> 39:30.740
Okay.

39:30.775 --> 39:33.877
See you in class.

39:54.033 --> 39:56.634
I went to your game.

39:56.669 --> 40:00.438
I know you didn't want me to.

40:00.472 --> 40:02.574
But I did.

40:04.443 --> 40:06.711
Look here.

40:06.746 --> 40:09.915
I-I want you to know, um...

40:12.619 --> 40:16.856
I know how much
of your life I missed.

40:16.890 --> 40:19.225
I really...

40:19.259 --> 40:21.761
I did some bad stuff.

40:21.795 --> 40:24.531
And I was gone.

40:27.101 --> 40:29.837
Time I'll never get back.

40:33.176 --> 40:35.778
Look at you.

40:35.812 --> 40:39.949
You only 17 years old.

40:39.984 --> 40:43.186
And you already better
than I ever was.

40:46.623 --> 40:48.458
And you were right.

40:50.594 --> 40:52.061
It's your house now.

40:52.095 --> 40:54.663
And you the man here.

40:54.698 --> 40:57.933
I didn't ask
if I could stay here.

40:57.967 --> 41:02.470
That was wrong.
Sorry.

41:08.343 --> 41:11.579
[Chuckles] Tonight...

41:13.349 --> 41:17.652
For the first time
in my life...

41:17.686 --> 41:20.721
I knew what pride felt like.

41:23.391 --> 41:26.327
Ha. I mean, boy, you...

41:26.362 --> 41:29.096
That was crazy out there.
[Laughs]

41:29.131 --> 41:31.999
You... you the man for real.

41:32.034 --> 41:35.904
Leaping over players
in a single bound, boy.

41:35.938 --> 41:37.872
[Chuckling]

41:53.955 --> 41:57.157
I'm proud of you, Vincent.

42:10.905 --> 42:12.773
[Door opens and closes]

42:16.644 --> 42:20.580
Hey, so, uh,
so where you gonna be?

42:20.615 --> 42:23.384
I'll be around.
