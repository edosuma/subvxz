00:01.929 --> 00:03.399
Previously on Angel:

00:03.649 --> 00:05.019
Landok? Is that you?

00:05.450 --> 00:07.129
- The two of you are--
- Cousins.

00:07.849 --> 00:10.060
Fred disappeared
and was never found.

00:10.849 --> 00:15.419
The vision. This book. We can send
him back. The portal works both ways.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.120
Cordelia!

00:17.449 --> 00:19.870
Cordy's in the Host's dimension now.

00:20.449 --> 00:23.539
They have no music there.
She's in a bad place.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.070
They use you as a slave
till you give.

00:27.649 --> 00:28.910
- Fugitive!
- No!

00:34.850 --> 00:37.520
- I'm not on fire?
- It is another dimension.

00:37.850 --> 00:39.079
My cow is cursed!

00:39.649 --> 00:43.090
I don't know about any curse.
I just have these visions.

00:43.850 --> 00:45.359
She has the Sight.

00:45.649 --> 00:46.909
For your crime...

00:47.450 --> 00:50.780
...you'll be jailed until our
Royal Highness sentences you.

00:51.049 --> 00:52.490
One...

00:54.049 --> 00:55.350
...two...

00:55.850 --> 00:56.789
...three!

01:05.049 --> 01:06.060
Hi, guys.

01:10.450 --> 01:11.459
Cordelia?

01:11.650 --> 01:12.950
No way!

01:13.450 --> 01:15.939
You're safe.

01:16.450 --> 01:19.120
A little bit.
They made me ruler.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.620
- But this is fantastic!
- Well...

01:25.450 --> 01:28.329
...my throne could use a
few extra cushions.

01:29.049 --> 01:31.819
But I'm really not going to complain.

01:32.049 --> 01:34.150
You can order them to release us.

01:34.450 --> 01:36.939
- I can.
- Shall we gut them now, so you...

01:38.049 --> 01:39.799
...can eat them, Most High?

01:40.450 --> 01:42.450
You're most high for thinking that.

01:42.849 --> 01:46.260
Besides, shouldn't there be
some groveling first?

01:47.049 --> 01:48.379
Cordelia.

01:49.450 --> 01:51.799
Okay.
Off with their heads!

01:54.849 --> 01:55.829
Kidding!

02:50.650 --> 02:52.789
Your Majesty, I must protest.

02:53.650 --> 02:56.250
Freeing criminals in your presence?

02:56.650 --> 02:59.740
You're gonna make me use
my important voice, aren't you?

03:00.849 --> 03:02.219
Leave us!

03:12.250 --> 03:13.439
- Thank God!
- Yes!

03:14.050 --> 03:16.750
Food! I thought we'd
never see food again.

03:20.050 --> 03:21.560
What happened?

03:22.449 --> 03:25.500
They jabbed me with
hot pokers for a while...

03:26.050 --> 03:27.800
...then made me princess!

03:29.050 --> 03:30.590
It doesn't make sense.

03:30.849 --> 03:34.889
In a world where humans are slaves,
why would they make one monarch?

03:35.650 --> 03:38.389
- You had a vision, didn't you?
- Yeah.

03:39.250 --> 03:42.199
Can I just say: visions,
not getting any easier.

03:42.849 --> 03:44.219
I'm still vibrating.

03:44.650 --> 03:47.139
- That could be from the pokers.
- See?

03:47.650 --> 03:50.389
- A vision. That explains it.
- It does?

03:51.250 --> 03:54.129
- Well, see, there's this prophecy.
- Great.

03:54.849 --> 03:56.740
Those always go well.

03:57.250 --> 04:00.900
The priests that have been in charge,
the Covenant of Trombli--

04:01.449 --> 04:04.189
Anyway, they teach
of a coming messiah:

04:05.650 --> 04:09.020
The Cursed One.
A being with the Pure Sight...

04:09.849 --> 04:12.020
...who will restore the monarchy.

04:12.849 --> 04:16.110
- Pure sight?
- A direct link to The Powers That Be.

04:16.449 --> 04:17.750
I mean her.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.990
- She's the messiah?
- It could happen.

04:24.250 --> 04:27.060
It has.
That's what the Trombli believe.

04:27.850 --> 04:32.269
We might stand a chance of surviving
long enough to find a way out.

04:32.649 --> 04:35.459
- How did you get in?
- Via portal, with the book.

04:36.850 --> 04:38.639
We seem to have misplaced it.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.600
- The portal or the book?
- Both.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.459
They've got books here.

04:44.649 --> 04:48.339
Those Trombonal guys,
they used some when they swore me in.

04:49.449 --> 04:51.199
I've got to see those.

04:51.850 --> 04:54.970
To get back to the "Cordelia
isn't a princess" dimension?

04:55.449 --> 04:58.930
Don't we still need an
inter-dimensional hot spot?

04:59.649 --> 05:01.370
Yes, that's true.

05:02.050 --> 05:03.449
Angel....

05:06.250 --> 05:07.930
He's reflecting!

05:09.250 --> 05:13.149
The metaphysical laws which govern
our world don't apply here.

05:13.449 --> 05:16.329
- He can walk in the sun too.
- Okay.

05:17.649 --> 05:22.220
- This is from entering the portal?
- No. It always looks like that.

05:23.050 --> 05:26.810
Angel, while we find the proper
incantation, go with the Host.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.199
See if you can document
any portal activity.

05:30.850 --> 05:33.410
- I don't get it.
- Well, we need to ascertain--

05:33.850 --> 05:36.899
No, I mean why didn't anybody
tell me about this?

05:38.050 --> 05:39.939
You look good.

05:42.250 --> 05:46.040
- You're not just saying that?
- Angel, please. Go with the Host.

05:47.649 --> 05:50.250
Track down Landok.
Speak to his family--

05:50.649 --> 05:52.370
Back up. Back up.

05:53.050 --> 05:55.819
You want me to talk to my family?
On purpose?

05:57.850 --> 06:02.519
It's that, or face never returning
to our own dimension again.

06:03.850 --> 06:06.970
Come. Stare at yourself
in my grandmother's glass eye.

06:08.050 --> 06:12.470
Call me Lorne. In Pylea, a "host"
is one more thing to lay your eggs in.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.879
Yeah, fine.
Hey, can we get my coat?

06:15.850 --> 06:17.920
The books. Can we get access?

06:18.250 --> 06:20.040
Am I not the princess?

06:20.490 --> 06:23.160
Letting her wear the crown
is a sacrilege.

06:24.089 --> 06:27.110
She is cursed. She has the Sight.
We all agree.

06:27.689 --> 06:31.939
Not all. Why would The Powers
choose this craven beast?

06:32.490 --> 06:33.610
It doesn't matter.

06:34.290 --> 06:40.160
She's our sovereign and must not be
harmed. Not until after the com-shuk.

06:40.889 --> 06:43.170
If the princess survives
the com-shuk...

06:43.889 --> 06:48.139
...then you may have
her head, Barshon. But not before.

06:55.290 --> 06:59.259
Boy, I'd give my left horn
to not have to do this.

07:04.889 --> 07:06.430
Hi-dee-ho!

07:09.689 --> 07:10.879
Guess who's back.

07:12.089 --> 07:14.509
Krevlornswath?

07:16.889 --> 07:18.610
Can it be true?

07:19.889 --> 07:22.519
I've prayed that I might
see you aga;n.

07:22.889 --> 07:24.360
You're in luck then.

07:27.089 --> 07:31.230
- You've shamed and betrayed our clan.
- Thanks, Mom.

07:31.889 --> 07:36.310
Each morning before I feed, I go out
into the hills where it's parched...

07:37.290 --> 07:41.149
...beat my breast and curse the birth
of such a cretinous boy!

07:42.089 --> 07:43.420
My mother!

07:43.889 --> 07:46.769
Your father was right.
We ate the wrong son.

07:47.490 --> 07:51.180
Enough of this reminiscing.
A few questions, then I'll go.

07:51.689 --> 07:54.500
Remember five years ago,
when I disappeared?

07:55.290 --> 07:57.110
Did you notice anything odd?

07:57.089 --> 07:58.839
Feasting and celebration.

07:59.490 --> 08:02.089
Your brother Numfar
did the Dance of Joy.

08:02.490 --> 08:05.470
Numfar! Do the Dance of Joy.

08:06.089 --> 08:09.350
Actually, what I meant was
more like strange flashing...

08:10.290 --> 08:12.079
...kind of a weird pulsating--

08:12.689 --> 08:17.009
They don't have music here. I wish
it was the same for dancing.

08:17.490 --> 08:21.180
Lights. You couldn't have missed it.
Big, bendy, swirly--

08:22.290 --> 08:24.540
Stop doing the Dance of Joy, Numfar!

08:24.689 --> 08:26.199
Nothing like that at all?

08:26.490 --> 08:28.839
Take your cow and get off my lawn.

08:30.089 --> 08:31.139
That's no cow.

08:31.889 --> 08:34.139
My friend.
It's good to see you again.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.909
I'd have died in your world,
were it not for you.

08:38.490 --> 08:40.490
You know Krevlornswath's cow?

08:40.889 --> 08:43.799
- He's Angel, the brave Drokken killer.
- Just Angel....

08:44.490 --> 08:47.120
He's a valiant and courageous warrior.

08:47.490 --> 08:49.519
We shall welcome and honor him.

08:49.889 --> 08:53.190
- Numfar, do the Dance of Honor!
- Landok, hi...

08:54.090 --> 08:57.110
...we have a few portal queries,
and then we'll--

08:57.690 --> 08:59.720
We shall adorn him like a warrior...

09:00.090 --> 09:03.809
- ...so all may know of his valor.
- No wire hanger. That's leather!

09:04.889 --> 09:08.080
Guys. You know, this really isn't....

09:08.490 --> 09:09.360
Nice!

09:09.690 --> 09:12.179
You'll be guest of honor at the feast.

09:12.690 --> 09:16.940
There, you'll tell of your bravery
against the vicious Drokken.

09:18.090 --> 09:21.779
Now, about the hair.
Do you think that...?

09:25.889 --> 09:29.190
Why, it's the homecoming
I always dreamed of.

09:34.649 --> 09:36.720
Can you actually read this stuff?

09:37.649 --> 09:40.700
It resembles some
demonic languages with which I'm...

09:41.850 --> 09:43.149
...familiar, but...

09:43.649 --> 09:45.649
...whole passages are missing.

09:48.450 --> 09:51.049
Fascinating. A hart.

09:53.850 --> 09:57.990
It's not a heart, it's Bambi.
We expect him to read this tiny print?

09:59.250 --> 10:04.029
No, not H-E-A-R-T, H-A-R-T.
A male red deer or staggard...

10:04.649 --> 10:06.539
...often linked with mysticism.

10:07.049 --> 10:10.629
They all got animals on them.
Probably demon bedtime stories.

10:11.850 --> 10:15.149
Of course! The holy books
are written in trionic.

10:16.049 --> 10:16.850
What?

10:17.250 --> 10:20.940
No one volume is complete
without the other two.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.980
It's one book broken up
into three pieces.

10:25.049 --> 10:26.730
- Like a trilogy.
- No.

10:26.850 --> 10:29.799
Much more complex than that.
See this passage?

10:30.450 --> 10:32.799
It continues in this volume, here...

10:33.450 --> 10:35.799
...then concludes in this one.

10:36.450 --> 10:40.100
The sentence structure indicates
when to go from book to book.

10:40.649 --> 10:41.659
Any portals?

10:41.850 --> 10:44.169
I'm not sure.
It takes time to decipher.

10:44.850 --> 10:47.620
Starting to bore the princess.

10:48.450 --> 10:51.570
But I am finding references
to The Cursed One.

10:52.049 --> 10:55.559
Really?
There's stuff about Messiah Me?

10:56.850 --> 10:58.500
"Com-shuk"....

10:58.649 --> 10:59.519
Huh?

11:00.450 --> 11:02.379
Contextually, a verb.

11:02.850 --> 11:06.919
- Something I'm going to do?
- With a Groosalugg.

11:07.649 --> 11:09.929
- What does that mean?
- I have no idea.

11:10.649 --> 11:12.679
- Sounds dirty.
- Nobody asked you.

11:13.049 --> 11:15.299
Let's just ask somebody
what it means.

11:16.049 --> 11:17.240
Like who?

11:17.250 --> 11:19.919
One of them priests.
These belong to them.

11:20.850 --> 11:21.690
Yeah.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.940
Look, you're the princess.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.429
- Can't you make them translate it?
- I guess I could.

11:28.049 --> 11:30.440
Yeah! Why not?

11:30.450 --> 11:32.940
Princess not taking a vote, is she?

11:34.049 --> 11:36.190
I'll make a decree.

11:38.250 --> 11:39.860
Wolf.

11:40.649 --> 11:42.190
Ram.

11:45.450 --> 11:46.610
And Hart.

11:49.049 --> 11:51.440
I'm not sure the priests
can be trusted.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.990
--the scroll was just tipping
from his fingertips.

11:55.850 --> 11:58.970
And his eyes--
The fighting was fierce!

11:59.450 --> 12:04.019
I chopped off the evil
lawyer-beast's hand, and he screamed...

12:04.850 --> 12:06.809
...and then I left.

12:19.850 --> 12:23.110
You're a regular
Hans Christian Tarantino.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.549
We should get back to the palace.

12:29.450 --> 12:32.259
I hate to disappoint the kids.
They enjoy it.

12:32.450 --> 12:36.350
Nice to be a hero without the
moral ambiguities like back home?

12:37.250 --> 12:39.639
Yeah. Maybe it is, a little.

12:40.250 --> 12:43.059
You start to see yourself
the way they do.

12:43.850 --> 12:48.029
You become that image. I get it.
I know how they see me. Can we go?

12:48.649 --> 12:49.519
Just one more--

12:49.850 --> 12:53.679
Tell us again of the sorcerer
who could remove his limbs at will.

12:54.049 --> 12:56.190
Right, because that's a good one.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.460
It is time for the Bach-nal.

13:01.250 --> 13:05.009
- Angel, you shall swing the crebbil.
- Yeah? Okay.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.500
The crebbil?
Angel, Angel, Angel....

13:10.730 --> 13:14.980
- Cordelia, you must listen to me.
- No, I think I've heard enough.

13:15.529 --> 13:19.179
You want me to go back where
we'd be slaves? Sorry, not good.

13:19.730 --> 13:21.980
There are forces at work here.

13:22.730 --> 13:26.210
You don't know who these priests are
or what they serve.

13:26.929 --> 13:28.049
Look, you can go.

13:28.129 --> 13:30.620
But I must stay here
and be a princess.

13:31.129 --> 13:35.269
- And com-shuk with a Groosalugg.
- Better than shoveling horse poo.

13:36.529 --> 13:38.210
Majesty.

13:41.330 --> 13:42.450
You all right?

13:43.129 --> 13:44.070
- Yeah.
- No.

13:44.330 --> 13:47.070
Priesty, what's with this Groosalugg?

13:47.929 --> 13:50.840
- What's that about?
- You had a vision, Majesty?

13:52.129 --> 13:53.500
Yes.

13:55.129 --> 13:57.409
Yes, she has had a vision.

13:57.529 --> 14:00.059
So you may as well
be candid with her...

14:01.730 --> 14:03.129
...or she'll know.

14:03.529 --> 14:05.279
No lying to the messiah.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.389
Clearly, Majesty has seen
the Groosalugg.

14:08.929 --> 14:11.179
It was summoned from the Scum Pits.

14:11.929 --> 14:13.259
Scum Pits?

14:13.129 --> 14:17.129
- It'll arrive before nightfall.
- So the really close Scum Pits.

14:17.929 --> 14:21.720
Everyone is very anxious
for Her Majesty to com-shuk with it.

14:22.730 --> 14:25.149
Of course.
Why wouldn't they be?

14:25.730 --> 14:29.730
These two, they didn't know what
the com-shuk was. You tell them.

14:31.730 --> 14:33.940
The com-shuk is a mating ritual.

14:34.730 --> 14:36.269
I told you it was dirty.

14:36.529 --> 14:37.720
Yes!

14:38.330 --> 14:42.470
Exactly. The mating ritual.
Which is great.

14:43.730 --> 14:48.049
It's been a really long time
since I've had a good com-shuk.

14:49.129 --> 14:50.500
So, um....

14:50.929 --> 14:53.350
I'm just gonna run out
for a minute...

14:53.929 --> 14:56.950
...because I wanted to get it a gift.
And you know...

14:57.529 --> 15:01.990
...Groosaluggs are hard to buy for.
So I should hurry.

15:02.929 --> 15:05.350
You mustn't leave
the palace, Majesty.

15:06.529 --> 15:09.019
The rebels are out.
There are rumblings.

15:09.529 --> 15:11.389
Rebel rumblings?

15:11.330 --> 15:13.889
- We've doubled the palace guard.
- Doubled?

15:15.529 --> 15:19.360
- Tell me when the Groosalugg is here.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

15:20.330 --> 15:23.950
Okay. Well, then you can go.

15:24.529 --> 15:26.779
Thank you, Your Majesty.

15:32.929 --> 15:34.649
Let's get the hell out of here.

15:41.929 --> 15:45.340
- Swing the crebbil!
- Swing the crebbil!

15:46.730 --> 15:47.960
Swing the crebbil!

15:48.529 --> 15:49.399
Angel....

15:49.730 --> 15:51.340
Angel!

16:03.529 --> 16:05.629
Swing the crebbil!

16:06.529 --> 16:08.919
Swing the crebbil!

16:10.129 --> 16:12.620
Strike quickly and true.
Then we can eat.

16:22.009 --> 16:23.240
Swing the crebbil!

16:25.009 --> 16:27.710
- You expect me to--
- Sever the cow's head!

16:28.610 --> 16:31.519
Make it quick, make it quick,
make it quick.

16:32.210 --> 16:34.909
It is a great honor
to swing the crebbil.

16:38.210 --> 16:39.539
What is he doing?

16:40.009 --> 16:42.990
- You want me to kill her?
- The cow's a runaway!

16:43.610 --> 16:46.559
It sneaks down and plunders
our food stores.

16:47.210 --> 16:50.399
- She was probably hungry.
- You won't swing the crebbil?

16:53.809 --> 16:55.669
Only if you force me to.

16:56.210 --> 16:57.679
Here we go.

16:58.610 --> 17:01.799
We'll back up slowly,
and these good folks are gonna...

17:01.970 --> 17:03.340
- Stop them!
- ...kill us!

17:07.970 --> 17:08.910
Stop...

17:09.170 --> 17:11.630
...in the name of love

17:13.210 --> 17:15.910
Before you break my heart

17:18.608 --> 17:20.259
For, baby, I'm aware

17:20.410 --> 17:22.269
What strange sorcery is this?

17:23.410 --> 17:27.519
Each time you leave my door

17:28.809 --> 17:31.759
It burns! It burns!

17:32.410 --> 17:34.480
Knowing you're all the love
You'll meet

17:37.809 --> 17:38.970
Come on!

17:46.250 --> 17:48.039
Think it--
Oh, shit!

17:48.650 --> 17:50.160
Okay.

17:51.049 --> 17:52.769
Hurry up!

17:53.450 --> 17:55.309
If we ever get out of here...

17:55.849 --> 17:59.500
...find me a dimension where demons
don't want to impregnate me.

18:00.049 --> 18:02.720
Is it too much to ask?
What is it about me?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.930
Do I put out a com-shuk-me vibe?

18:06.049 --> 18:07.869
I mean, you'd tell me, right?

18:11.450 --> 18:14.640
Okay, smells like I'll be mating
with the Groosalugg.

18:15.410 --> 18:16.710
You can do this.

18:17.210 --> 18:19.980
The sewage system
is our only sure bet.

18:20.210 --> 18:23.720
- Just hold your breath.
- Why can't we use the front door?

18:24.410 --> 18:26.869
- Your booty getting through the door?
- Hey.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.160
- That booty.
- Oh.

18:30.410 --> 18:35.190
I wanted something to remember
my reign by. Is that so wrong?

18:38.210 --> 18:40.349
- Oh, God.
- Here you go.

18:41.210 --> 18:42.400
You first.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.960
We've been looking for Your Majesty.

18:59.210 --> 19:02.190
The servants must have left
that door open.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.390
Yeah.

19:04.609 --> 19:06.710
It's kind of whiffy in here.

19:13.009 --> 19:16.130
I just thought I would have
this stuff appraised.

19:16.609 --> 19:19.000
Your Majesty,
the Groosalugg approaches.

19:20.809 --> 19:22.740
Oh, good.

19:31.609 --> 19:34.309
- She didn't make it.
- Now what?

19:35.210 --> 19:36.369
We find Angel.

19:47.690 --> 19:50.150
I don't think we've been followed.

19:51.289 --> 19:55.430
We should probably stay on foot,
in case they try to track us down.

20:00.289 --> 20:01.369
You okay?

20:04.490 --> 20:08.390
Handsome man saved me
from the monsters.

20:11.089 --> 20:12.950
Bye.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.339
Hey! Wait a minute!

20:53.690 --> 20:55.019
Hello?

21:05.690 --> 21:07.130
Great place.

21:09.890 --> 21:12.420
You don't have to
be afraid of me, really.

21:12.890 --> 21:15.660
You know I'd never...

21:17.690 --> 21:19.440
...hurt you.

21:24.289 --> 21:25.829
So....

21:26.690 --> 21:30.619
- So you don't want to talk to me?
- Yeah.

21:32.089 --> 21:33.809
Why won't you?

21:33.890 --> 21:34.759
Because...

21:35.089 --> 21:39.410
...you're not real. Or I'm not real.

21:40.490 --> 21:43.230
Somebody here isn't real.
I think it's you.

21:43.490 --> 21:47.910
If you're not real, then it means
my head was chopped off. I'm dead now.

21:49.490 --> 21:52.720
Dead. And with me being dead
and you being not real...

21:53.089 --> 21:55.829
...I can't have
a conversation with you.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.549
It's just too much, all right?

21:59.089 --> 22:01.119
Okay.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.680
What's that you're doing?

22:09.289 --> 22:11.779
I think I saw it in a dream.

22:13.490 --> 22:15.380
You've been here a long time.

22:15.890 --> 22:18.519
Always.... Not always.

22:20.690 --> 22:23.430
I had a dream that I had a name.

22:24.289 --> 22:26.180
"Winifred."

22:30.890 --> 22:33.240
- You're the girl in Cordy's vision.
- What?

22:33.890 --> 22:34.869
"Fred."

22:35.089 --> 22:38.599
- You were studying to be a physicist.
- That's my dream.

22:39.289 --> 22:41.569
You vanished in Los Angeles
5 years ago.

22:42.289 --> 22:43.339
Stop it.

22:44.089 --> 22:45.839
- It's not a dream.
- It's not?

22:46.490 --> 22:47.359
No.

22:47.690 --> 22:51.380
- And my head's still on?
- Yeah.

22:51.890 --> 22:52.970
You're real?

22:56.089 --> 22:56.960
No.

22:57.289 --> 22:59.710
- No, I don't want you to be real.
- Why?

23:00.289 --> 23:03.619
Because you're nice and
you saved me.

23:04.490 --> 23:07.680
Bad things will happen to you here.
They always do.

23:08.089 --> 23:10.650
No, nothing bad will happen.
It'll be okay.

23:11.089 --> 23:12.910
- We'll take you out of here.
- We?

23:13.490 --> 23:17.769
- Me and my friends are going back.
- No, can't get back. There's no back.

23:18.890 --> 23:20.079
We'll open a portal--

23:20.089 --> 23:22.339
- The portal. She fell through it.
- Who?

23:23.089 --> 23:25.259
That other girl.
I couldn't save her.

23:25.490 --> 23:28.259
- They've got her. She'll die!
- Cordy?

23:29.089 --> 23:32.500
- She's fine. They made her princess.
- They--

23:33.289 --> 23:34.759
Really?

23:38.690 --> 23:42.339
When I got here, they--
They didn't do that.

23:45.890 --> 23:49.579
Well, that's nice for her.

23:50.569 --> 23:52.390
I'm wearing this for a first date?

23:52.970 --> 23:57.359
I don't want to seem too easy.
I was thinking a nice tailored suit...

23:58.369 --> 23:59.599
...of armor.

24:00.170 --> 24:04.670
I figured we'd start slow. A few
dinners, some light conversation...

24:05.569 --> 24:09.750
...then, in three or four years,
if we're still hitting it off--

24:10.369 --> 24:11.839
- Your Majesty.
- Yeah?

24:12.170 --> 24:13.569
The Groosalugg.

24:15.170 --> 24:19.740
You think it would add some feminine
mystery if I were to not be here?

24:25.970 --> 24:27.019
Kill me now.

24:33.170 --> 24:35.130
Just put those anywhere.

24:43.970 --> 24:45.829
Majesty.

24:48.769 --> 24:50.839
I've never been to the palace.

24:51.769 --> 24:55.180
I've seen it up there,
on that hill, watching me.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.930
We've just got to find my friends.

25:02.569 --> 25:03.509
Get down!

25:08.569 --> 25:11.480
You may see something scary,
but I'm your friend.

25:44.650 --> 25:47.250
Bad things always happen here.

26:13.730 --> 26:15.619
An animal...

26:16.130 --> 26:19.539
...a beast. To my people,
I was nothing more than this.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.009
Why?

26:23.930 --> 26:28.069
- Can you not see why?
- Not exactly. You seem good to me.

26:28.730 --> 26:32.099
You are truly beneficent.
Such compassion...

26:33.529 --> 26:36.970
...to ignore the flaws
of my polluted birth.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.470
Well-- Huh?

26:44.490 --> 26:47.440
The strange curve of my mouth.

26:48.089 --> 26:51.420
The odd bulging of my limbs.

26:52.289 --> 26:56.430
The heart beating in the wrong place.

26:58.289 --> 27:01.769
As I matured, these defects
became more apparent.

27:02.490 --> 27:05.819
The Covenant soon determined
there could be no mistake.

27:06.690 --> 27:08.829
There was cow's blood in my veins.

27:10.289 --> 27:11.200
So?

27:11.490 --> 27:13.950
Heck, I'm all cow-- Human.

27:14.490 --> 27:18.490
No, no, no. You are beyond
cow or god. You...

27:19.289 --> 27:21.319
...you are the transcendent one.

27:21.690 --> 27:22.740
I am?

27:22.890 --> 27:24.680
You're cursed by The Powers.

27:25.289 --> 27:27.539
- Tell me about it.
- For my people...

27:28.289 --> 27:31.839
...to be part cow is to be less.
I couldn't prove my worth.

27:32.490 --> 27:36.700
I was incapable even
of performing husbandly duties...

27:37.289 --> 27:38.940
...with my tribe's females.

27:39.690 --> 27:42.460
- You're--
- Equipped to mate only with a human.

27:42.690 --> 27:45.359
- Good to know.
- I was cast from my village...

27:45.690 --> 27:49.240
...cut off from my life-givers,
forced to make it on my own.

27:51.089 --> 27:54.809
My parents were busted for tax fraud.
My trust fund dried up.

27:55.890 --> 27:58.240
I sought to end my suffering.

27:58.890 --> 28:00.609
Get out.

28:04.890 --> 28:07.309
No. Wait!

28:10.289 --> 28:11.480
He can stay.

28:15.089 --> 28:16.069
Go on.

28:16.289 --> 28:18.819
You sought to end your suffering.

28:19.289 --> 28:21.819
I entered every contest
of skill and daring...

28:22.289 --> 28:25.519
...in an attempt to snuff out
my pathetic life.

28:26.490 --> 28:28.349
But, even at this, I failed.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.450
You did?

28:30.089 --> 28:33.250
I won every match.
I vanquished every Flame Beast.

28:33.690 --> 28:36.950
I defeated every Drokken.

28:39.089 --> 28:40.740
Nothing could stop me.

28:41.490 --> 28:46.019
The Covenant had no choice but to
bestow upon me the name Groosalugg...

28:47.490 --> 28:49.740
...the brave and undefeated.

28:50.490 --> 28:52.240
Wow!

28:55.289 --> 28:57.890
- Majesty.
- What?

28:58.890 --> 29:00.920
There was trouble
at the Bach-nal.

29:01.289 --> 29:04.549
The prisoner is ready
for your cruel punishment.

29:04.890 --> 29:07.519
Handle it, will you?
I'm busy.

29:08.490 --> 29:10.559
Execute the prisoner.

29:12.089 --> 29:13.099
Wait!

29:14.490 --> 29:16.099
Hang on!

29:16.289 --> 29:18.039
Pardon him! I pardon him!

29:19.289 --> 29:20.369
Pardon him.

29:21.089 --> 29:22.420
Release him now!

29:22.890 --> 29:24.680
Oh, baby.

29:25.289 --> 29:26.970
Are you okay?

29:28.289 --> 29:31.130
Not as good as you, obviously.

29:31.890 --> 29:34.420
Do you want to borrow their cuffs?

29:35.490 --> 29:38.440
Listen, I'll get right back to you.

29:39.089 --> 29:40.559
You're pardoned. Shoo!

29:40.890 --> 29:44.650
- Where's Wesley and Gunn?
- I'm sure they're fine.

29:46.970 --> 29:48.579
- We're lost.
- Nonsense.

29:48.769 --> 29:51.609
Follow the sun. We'll head
towards the village.

29:52.369 --> 29:54.119
- Which one?
- Which village?

29:54.769 --> 29:58.980
Which sun? There are two of them.
Alternate dimension. We're lost.

29:59.569 --> 30:02.829
You having a Blair Witch moment?

30:03.769 --> 30:05.519
Something's hunting us.

30:06.170 --> 30:08.940
- Palace guards?
- I don't know.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.150
What the hell is it?

30:27.769 --> 30:29.140
Move! Move!

30:29.569 --> 30:30.579
Move!

30:31.970 --> 30:32.839
It's Angel!

30:36.769 --> 30:38.450
Angel! Can you hear me?

30:39.769 --> 30:40.680
Angel?

31:21.769 --> 31:22.779
You're hurt.

31:24.170 --> 31:25.819
What just happened?

31:25.970 --> 31:28.849
That strange wild girl
saved us from Angel.

31:29.569 --> 31:32.519
Something very freaky
is going on here.

31:33.170 --> 31:34.470
I may know what.

31:35.569 --> 31:40.140
Angel's vampire self has been
sublimated somehow by this dimension.

31:40.970 --> 31:42.579
It's okay.

31:43.970 --> 31:47.089
- Only his human side has surfaced.
- Being in the sun...

31:47.569 --> 31:49.529
- ...seeing his reflection.
- Yes.

31:49.970 --> 31:52.430
Now somehow he's accessed
his demon...

31:52.970 --> 31:55.359
...but he can't find the balance.

31:55.970 --> 31:58.599
His demon self has overcome
his human side.

31:59.569 --> 32:02.690
That's what the thing inside
of him looks like?

32:03.170 --> 32:04.819
In its purest form.

32:04.970 --> 32:06.930
It's nasty.

32:07.970 --> 32:09.859
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

32:10.369 --> 32:12.019
We've got to help him.

32:17.569 --> 32:18.690
- All right?
- Yeah.

32:31.369 --> 32:33.470
Oh, good. More fun.

34:18.050 --> 34:21.239
And that, my princess,
is my story in full.

34:21.650 --> 34:26.219
When they summoned me, I was killing
a beast in the Scum Pit of Ur.

34:29.449 --> 34:33.800
It's a great story.
And you're a great Groosalugg.

34:34.849 --> 34:35.760
But...

34:36.650 --> 34:38.329
...I'm not your princess.

34:40.250 --> 34:44.150
The truth is,
I'm not anybody's princess.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.250
- Have you not the Curse?
- The visions?

34:48.650 --> 34:51.559
Yeah, I've got visions
coming out of my ears.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.710
But that doesn't make me a princess.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.739
That just makes me kind of weird.

34:58.849 --> 35:00.429
I do not understand.

35:02.449 --> 35:06.519
Where I come from,
who I really am...

35:07.250 --> 35:11.219
...is so far from being a princess.
You have no idea.

35:14.449 --> 35:16.409
I'm an actress.

35:16.849 --> 35:19.269
- I do not know this word.
- Actress?

35:19.849 --> 35:22.800
It means when I'm lucky enough
to get the gig...

35:23.449 --> 35:27.840
...people tell me what to do, where
to stand, how to move, what to say--

35:28.849 --> 35:31.099
You're the concubine of your village.

35:31.849 --> 35:33.989
Felt like one sometimes.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.599
Last job, I wore this horrible outfit.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.809
It was this tiny,
skimpy, exploitative--

35:40.849 --> 35:42.389
Nothing like this.

35:44.449 --> 35:48.070
- Have they no eyes in this village?
- What do you mean?

35:49.250 --> 35:53.289
Can they not just look upon you
and see that you are a princess?

35:55.849 --> 35:57.710
I'm not.

35:58.250 --> 36:01.800
Well, pardon my impudence, Majesty,
but you're wrong.

36:02.449 --> 36:04.659
The Covenant has declared it so.

36:06.050 --> 36:08.679
It doesn't matter what they say.

36:10.250 --> 36:11.789
Then you declare it so.

36:12.650 --> 36:16.300
You declare it with your bearing
and with your beauty...

36:16.849 --> 36:19.969
...and the mercy you bestowed
upon your subject today.

36:20.449 --> 36:22.170
He was a friend of mine.

36:22.849 --> 36:27.130
If you treat all of your subjects
this way, you will do much good.

36:30.050 --> 36:31.769
It's a beautiful dream.

36:33.050 --> 36:34.869
Really, it is.

36:36.050 --> 36:38.610
But it's not real.

36:40.250 --> 36:42.110
Why not?

36:48.369 --> 36:51.849
Parchment. She's asked for parchment.

36:52.570 --> 36:55.170
- Some strange cow-mating ritual?
- No.

36:56.170 --> 36:59.360
- She wants to make proclamations.
- Proclamations?

36:59.769 --> 37:02.090
She's decided she can do some good.

37:02.769 --> 37:04.909
Then the com-shuk hasn't happened.

37:05.769 --> 37:08.400
It's time to send
our princess a message.

37:08.769 --> 37:12.809
I know how we send a message
to the princess. We storm the palace.

37:13.570 --> 37:17.050
It'd be suicide.
We'd be wiped out in minutes.

37:17.769 --> 37:21.070
- Yeah, but it'd be a message.
- Excuse me.

37:21.969 --> 37:24.389
- I couldn't help overhearing.
- Wesley!

37:24.969 --> 37:27.639
It's all right. We can help
these brave men.

37:27.969 --> 37:29.789
Shut up, reconnaissance scum.

37:30.369 --> 37:33.559
I've told you already,
we're not reconnaissance cows.

37:33.969 --> 37:37.409
We tracked you coming
from the palace. Don't lie.

37:38.170 --> 37:41.289
I'm not lying. If you want
to send a message to her...

37:41.769 --> 37:44.539
- ...then I know we can help.
- Shut up, Wesley.

37:45.369 --> 37:46.559
How?

37:47.170 --> 37:51.099
We just happen to be close
personal friends with the princess.

37:51.969 --> 37:52.840
They know her!

37:53.170 --> 37:55.380
- Close friends?
- I can prove it!

37:56.170 --> 37:57.889
In my wallet--

37:59.170 --> 38:03.670
The leather holder in the back
of my leg coverings.

38:05.769 --> 38:06.820
That's it.

38:10.570 --> 38:12.639
It's true.
They know the princess.

38:12.969 --> 38:15.429
If you'd draw up a list of demands...

38:15.969 --> 38:19.059
...we'll be happy to present it
to Her Majesty.

38:19.570 --> 38:22.659
- Let's do it. Write a list of demands.
- You see?

38:23.769 --> 38:26.190
Put the list
and their severed heads...

38:26.769 --> 38:29.510
...on display outside
the princess's window.

38:30.369 --> 38:33.110
I'm glad I left
my people behind in L.A...

38:33.969 --> 38:36.039
...so I can come here to die.

39:08.690 --> 39:11.289
Are you feeling any better?

39:16.489 --> 39:20.210
It's okay. You don't have to talk.

39:20.690 --> 39:22.340
I'm used to it.

39:27.889 --> 39:30.699
They saw it. They looked right at it.

39:34.489 --> 39:35.929
Saw what?

39:36.889 --> 39:41.309
The monster.
They saw what I really am.

39:43.489 --> 39:45.139
I can't go back.

39:45.289 --> 39:47.539
Not now. I can never go back.

39:48.289 --> 39:49.449
Never.

39:49.489 --> 39:51.590
It's okay.

39:54.289 --> 39:55.340
You....

39:58.489 --> 40:00.769
You could stay here.

40:15.889 --> 40:18.840
This will free the slaves
and outlaw polyester.

40:20.090 --> 40:22.340
It hasn't been invented here yet...

40:23.090 --> 40:25.369
...but I'm a forward-thinking monarch.

40:27.289 --> 40:28.800
We didn't order anything.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.769
Get out, cow.

40:35.690 --> 40:37.690
You can't call him that.

40:38.090 --> 40:40.690
He is Groosalugg,
the brave and undefeated.

40:41.090 --> 40:45.659
- He is that only because I say he is.
- Groo! Where are you...?

40:48.889 --> 40:50.849
He just left.

40:51.889 --> 40:54.730
He understands the way of things.

40:55.489 --> 40:59.599
Yeah? Well, "the way of things"
is going to change around here.

41:00.289 --> 41:01.340
Is that right?

41:02.090 --> 41:04.119
Way.

41:05.090 --> 41:07.340
I've got proclamations.

41:08.090 --> 41:11.460
- Foolish girl.
- Who's wearing the tiara here, pal?

41:12.289 --> 41:14.989
The Powers have placed
their gift in you.

41:15.889 --> 41:18.590
- Got that right.
- But let us be clear...

41:18.889 --> 41:21.380
- ...you have no authority.
- I'm the princess.

41:21.889 --> 41:25.300
You, like the Groosalugg,
are a tool of the Covenant.

41:26.090 --> 41:27.909
You will do what we tell you.

41:28.489 --> 41:30.840
If we tell you to mate,
you shall mate.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.960
You can't force us to--

41:33.289 --> 41:36.380
If we tell you "silence,"
YOU shut your cow mouth!

41:38.690 --> 41:39.670
Pardon me?

41:39.889 --> 41:41.920
Pardon, Your Majesty?

41:42.889 --> 41:45.940
Don't you feel you've done
enough pardoning...

41:48.289 --> 41:50.179
...for one day?

42:32.690 --> 42:33.599
Thank you.
