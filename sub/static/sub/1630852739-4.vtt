00:10.635 --> 00:13.847
<i>I am karma and I'm a bitch.</i>

00:20.937 --> 00:22.605
<i>Can you play Hi8?</i>

00:23.982 --> 00:27.110
I want in. I can really help you
go big with this thing.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.612
<i>You do want to go big
with this thing, right?</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:30.739
Yes, I do.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.283
<i>You just worry about
getting the tapes out.</i>

00:33.283 --> 00:35.118
<i>All right? Leave the rest up to me.</i>

00:35.410 --> 00:37.328
My monologue... It's cut?

00:37.746 --> 00:40.331
Just thought it was stronger.
Wordless.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.208
Drop more wedgie, please, Katie.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.376
That's great.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.047
Bless us with the body and soul
of a child.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.133
<i>I don't care how big his dick is.</i>

00:50.300 --> 00:53.011
I can't show it to anybody
without releases. Fuck off!

00:53.178 --> 00:56.765
Nobody is ever getting rich
off a celebrity sex tape. Okay?

00:56.765 --> 00:59.726
What if we sold it somewhere
that nobody could ever find us?

00:59.851 --> 01:01.728
- A what site?
- A website.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.481
<i>It's this thing on the computer.
People will go to it.</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:06.733
<i>They will order the tape
directly from us.</i>

03:14.152 --> 03:16.070
That's the gestational sac.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.530
That's the yolk sac.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.909
- What's that?
- That? That's the embryo.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.243
That's your baby.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.411
Dude.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.582
Oh, my God!

03:27.582 --> 03:32.587
Hey, little peanut. It's me, Mommy.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.548
My God. That's in... That is in here!

03:35.632 --> 03:37.926
- Nice to meet you.
- This is...

03:38.176 --> 03:39.344
See that flicker?

03:42.305 --> 03:44.557
- No way.
- Is that...

03:44.682 --> 03:46.017
The heartbeat.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.562
That's a nice, steady beat.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.482
- Is it healthy? It sounds healthy.
- It's perfect.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.610
It's like a little 4/4.
The kicks are my heart.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.780
It is perfect.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.034
Guess what, fuckers?
I'm going to be a dad!

04:03.493 --> 04:04.702
On purpose!

04:34.565 --> 04:36.484
Excuse me. Is Erica around?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.695
Well, I don't know. Kitchen, maybe.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.375
Erica around here?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.876
Yeah, she's out there.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.438
That the new one?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.025
What are you doing here?

05:17.608 --> 05:20.445
I actually came here looking for you.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.614
What is that?

05:24.073 --> 05:25.742
The 400 bucks I owe you.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.368
For what?

05:27.493 --> 05:31.539
For Thanksgiving '91. Carving knife,
remember? The Urgent Care visit?

05:31.664 --> 05:33.875
Oh. Shit. Yes. Wow.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.210
Right. You don't have to do that.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.297
I know, but I can. So, I did.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.966
You can! You can?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.426
Yeah.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.846
You remember the thing I was alluding to
at dinner the other night?

05:46.971 --> 05:48.097
I do.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.265
It's going well.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.433
That's great, Rand.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.602
- Like, very well.
- That's great.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.441
So does that mean that we can finally
get divorced?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.318
No.

06:01.235 --> 06:05.365
I don't have enough for that yet.
I have $400, not 8,000.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.870
You enjoying it so far?

06:10.995 --> 06:12.538
- Mmm?
- The book.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.541
Oh! I'm only like 30 pages in.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.086
- Second favorite after <i>Lestat.
- Body Thief.</i>

06:18.086 --> 06:20.421
<i>Body Thief, Queen of the Damned,</i>
close second.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.548
<i>Damned,</i> I'll give you.
<i>Damned</i> is up there.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.176
You know, I have you to blame
for this obsession.

06:25.176 --> 06:28.054
Do you remember that day

06:28.471 --> 06:31.307
- you showed up with that huge stack?
- Yeah.

06:31.724 --> 06:32.934
All of them.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.812
How could I forget?

06:37.313 --> 06:39.023
Well, I should go.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.234
- Yeah.
- Thank you for this.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.402
No problem.

06:46.864 --> 06:50.159
I'm down here in the Valley for
a few days on a little scouting trip.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.078
Crystal, let me ask you something.

06:52.286 --> 06:56.457
How would you like to do porn, and not
have to fuck disgusting, sweaty men?

06:56.582 --> 07:00.336
How would you like to do porn and
and not have to fuck anyone at all?

07:02.505 --> 07:05.425
- There's my card.
- "Internet Entertainment Group?"

07:05.716 --> 07:08.136
- We're technology, slash...
- Excuse me.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.222
Did I hear you just mention
the Internet?

07:12.473 --> 07:13.474
I did.

07:13.558 --> 07:17.145
- Rand Gauthier.
- Seth Warshavsky.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.190
Seattle. Let me guess. Web cams.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.276
Very good. Yes.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.861
They say it's the future of porn.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.780
- And I would agree with them.
- Yeah, personally, I'm not a believer.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.657
- No?
- No, the image quality is awful.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.617
They take forever to load.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.411
Well, I see.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.955
Yeah. If I'm a guy
looking to rub one out,

07:35.955 --> 07:39.542
am I going to wait a half an hour
for some choppy, grainy video to load

07:39.542 --> 07:42.837
when I can just pop <i>Backseat Bangers 5,</i>
which is a classic in the VCR.

07:42.837 --> 07:46.674
I'm going to jack off in seconds.
Also, if they ever actually

07:46.674 --> 07:51.262
invent these 56k modems they keep
talking about, the image quality,

07:51.262 --> 07:54.182
it's not going to be nearly as good
as a good old-fashioned VHS.

07:54.182 --> 07:57.059
Well, you clearly know a lot
about this stuff, so.

07:57.143 --> 08:00.771
Yeah. You know, as a technophile
and former porn star,

08:00.855 --> 08:04.108
I am uniquely positioned
to talk about this.

08:04.233 --> 08:07.737
Well, I'm sorry to hear you think
cyberporn's bullshit.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.072
No, see, I don't. I actually think

08:10.156 --> 08:12.450
technology has the power
to revolutionize porn,

08:12.450 --> 08:14.494
but I think
you have to be smart about it.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.705
Look, I can't get into specifics,

08:17.705 --> 08:22.752
but I am currently harnessing
the power of the Web

08:22.919 --> 08:24.879
in a way
that has never been done before.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.841
Wow. Good for you, Dan.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.510
Rand.

08:30.801 --> 08:35.765
Good luck with your brilliant,
world changing idea.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.104
Dick.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.817
Breakfast time!

08:47.318 --> 08:49.487
Baby, it smells amazing.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.948
Follow the smell.

08:55.576 --> 08:56.744
You ready?

08:57.870 --> 08:59.580
Can you tell what that is?

09:00.623 --> 09:01.999
Fucking Mickey Mouse!

09:03.584 --> 09:04.919
Cop a squat.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.338
All right. I used a special
whole grain batter,

09:07.338 --> 09:09.632
a little extra nutrition for the peanut.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.051
- Baby.
- I'll get you some OJ.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.972
- Delicious!
- You're premium, baby, only the finest!

09:19.809 --> 09:21.060
Shit!

09:25.982 --> 09:27.525
You know what?

09:28.359 --> 09:30.403
This is way too precious to leave out.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.073
- I'll be back.
- Wait, where are you going?

09:49.880 --> 09:51.090
The fuck?

10:02.393 --> 10:06.188
An AK-47 FNC assault rifle,

10:06.272 --> 10:09.275
nickel plated Colt Commander .45
mother-of-pearl grips,

10:09.275 --> 10:13.195
a Rolex, a Cartier watch,

10:13.404 --> 10:14.989
a pair of gold cufflinks

10:14.989 --> 10:20.036
and this, like, big ass ruby
and diamond cross.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.204
What else?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.415
A wedding bikini.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.377
Yeah. White. God damn it!

10:28.461 --> 10:29.462
A wedding bikini?

10:30.671 --> 10:33.257
- White.
- Anything else?

10:34.216 --> 10:35.217
Tommy.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.180
Hold on a second.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.015
We'll be right outside.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.184
What's up?

10:43.476 --> 10:44.560
The tape.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.187
What tape?

10:47.355 --> 10:50.191
You know, the tape.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.903
- Oh.
- Wait, wasn't in there?

10:54.654 --> 10:58.115
Yes. Yes, I told you I was nervous

10:58.199 --> 11:00.660
and then you said
you put it in the safe.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.745
Shit.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.748
I think it was.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.752
It was.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.214
Oh, God.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.634
You know what?
Don't worry about it, baby.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.429
- They're gonna get it all back.
- Yeah.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.683
They're gonna get it all back. Guys!

11:28.229 --> 11:30.147
Actually, there was
this one other thing.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.399
Yeah?

11:31.941 --> 11:34.193
- Like a tape.
- A tape?

11:34.652 --> 11:36.153
Like a videotape.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.321
Like a movie?

11:37.405 --> 11:40.991
- Kind of. Home movies.
- Okay.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.535
Yeah.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.744
I...

11:45.246 --> 11:47.415
I trust that this is going to be

11:47.415 --> 11:50.835
a top priority case for you guys.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.422
We'll keep our ears open
if anything pops up,

11:54.547 --> 11:56.716
but burglaries don't get solved
that often.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.635
Wait. So what you're saying is

11:59.719 --> 12:01.929
you're not even gonna try
to get our stuff back?

12:01.929 --> 12:04.557
Sir, we're just trying
to manage your expectations.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.975
Somebody broke into our home

12:05.975 --> 12:08.310
and took our shit,
our own personal private shit.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.230
The number of burglaries per day,
it's up there.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.898
- I don't care about other robberies!
- Mr. Lee.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.068
I care about mine.
I pay more fucking taxes

12:16.152 --> 12:18.738
that I could own your fucking precinct!

12:18.738 --> 12:20.364
Mr. Lee, we're done here.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.576
- Let you know if we find anything.
- Really, dude?

12:24.952 --> 12:26.370
Whatever.

12:26.704 --> 12:31.459
Babe, there's
fucking guns in there, jewelry.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.587
I mean, who's going to bother
with some stupid, unmarked tape?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.673
I know, but if somebody
plays that thing, Tommy.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.924
Nobody's going to play it.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.136
And they couldn't even if they wanted.
its Hi8.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.763
Who the fuck has Hi8?

12:44.764 --> 12:45.890
Yeah.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.392
God, I feel...

12:49.977 --> 12:51.520
violated.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.358
Don't you?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.070
Violated?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.156
Yeah, you don't?

13:03.991 --> 13:07.620
I mean, I feel more... pissed.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.709
We'll get it back.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.296
- Hey.
- Yeah.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.714
I promise.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.343
- We're gonna get it, all right?
- Mm-hmm.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.261
Fuck the police.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.431
Fuck the police!

13:27.848 --> 13:29.642
Fuck the police!

13:29.642 --> 13:30.893
We'll get our own guy.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.520
Wait. What do you mean?

13:32.520 --> 13:34.146
What? Like a...

13:34.230 --> 13:36.315
We get like a private investigator.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.027
A PI. Exactly.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.821
Yes, that's great. Who?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.575
There's only two reasons
to steal a safe.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.707
Money and revenge.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.502
Money. That's tough,
that could be anybody.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.338
So let's start with revenge.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.466
Anybody you had beef with lately?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.135
- Beef?
- Anybody who hates you?

14:05.219 --> 14:06.971
Maybe had a reason to get back at you?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.265
No.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.183
No, I don't think so.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.810
What about you, Tommy?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.144
Who's got beef with me?

14:17.606 --> 14:18.941
Bret Michaels.

14:20.442 --> 14:21.944
Axl Rose.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.071
Blackie Lawless.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.823
Lou Adler. Gene Simmons.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.074
Fucking David Geffen.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.951
- Okay.
- Mickey Rourke.

14:28.951 --> 14:32.746
Yeah, Richie Sambora.
Jann Wenner, Bob Rock.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.957
- Got it.
- CC DeVille, John Stamos.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.419
- John Stamos?
- Fucking asshole.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.296
Wow.

14:41.297 --> 14:46.135
The police report says
the surveillance footage was destroyed.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.930
Anybody who had access
to your security system where it is?

14:50.598 --> 14:51.599
Just us.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.642
- Just me and Pamela.
- Right.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.185
Who installed it?

14:56.353 --> 15:00.858
Some dude.
This fucking dipshit carpenter.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.318
Dipshit carpenter?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.987
Yes. He was working on our house.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.739
Yeah, I canned his ass.

15:06.947 --> 15:07.948
For what reason?

15:08.032 --> 15:10.910
For the reason he was doing
a shitty ass job,

15:10.910 --> 15:12.661
so shitty I didn't even pay him.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.205
What? You never paid him?

15:15.289 --> 15:16.415
No.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.209
When was the last time
you saw this guy?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.503
Couple of days after I fired him.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.006
And what were the circumstances?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.300
He showed up
trying to get his tools back.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.093
Did you give them back?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.261
Of course.

15:29.345 --> 15:33.182
After coming into my house
without permission? Fuck, no.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.558
I almost smoked his ass.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.643
What?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.019
Smoked his ass?

15:37.019 --> 15:40.814
Yeah. I put a shottie in his face and
said, "Get the fuck off my property."

15:42.900 --> 15:44.068
Okay.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.112
Let me do some digging here.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.491
<i>The rusted chains of prison moons</i>

15:50.491 --> 15:54.244
<i>Are shattered by the sun</i>

15:54.453 --> 15:58.040
<i>I walk a road, horizons change</i>

15:58.040 --> 16:01.835
<i>The tournament's begun</i>

16:05.464 --> 16:08.592
<i>...softly sings</i>

16:11.011 --> 16:12.179
- Hello?
- Hi.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.350
Where is the tape?

16:16.892 --> 16:17.893
What?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.853
- Where the fuck is the tape?
- What tape?

16:23.774 --> 16:25.442
You know what fucking tape.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.444
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.905
Just tell me where it is,
it'll make this a lot easier.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.783
Am I getting warm? Am I warm? Am I warm?

16:32.783 --> 16:34.118
I don't know, man!

16:34.118 --> 16:35.619
Am I near?

16:37.496 --> 16:38.706
What the fuck is this shit?

16:39.331 --> 16:40.582
It's King Crimson, man.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.211
It's a first pressing!

16:45.921 --> 16:48.048
What I did to that record

16:48.132 --> 16:51.051
I will do to your fat, stupid face.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.178
No, dude, please. Please!

16:53.721 --> 16:57.391
I'm not gonna ask you again.
I'm gonna call the cops!

16:57.391 --> 17:00.561
I'll do it, Rand,
I'm calling the cops right now!

17:01.687 --> 17:03.063
Good, call 'em! Fuck you!

17:03.147 --> 17:05.149
- Shut your fucking...
- Okay, I'm gonna call now!

17:08.402 --> 17:12.781
I'll be back.
And you better have that fucking tape.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.579
Fuck.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.751
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hey. Miltie, thank God you picked up.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.419
<i>I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

17:25.419 --> 17:27.671
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

17:27.755 --> 17:29.757
Look, are you there?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.133
Are you there, man?

17:31.508 --> 17:32.968
<i>Are you there?</i>

17:33.052 --> 17:34.511
<i>If you're there, pick up, dude.</i>

17:35.012 --> 17:38.057
<i>Please. I need to talk to you, man.</i>

17:39.141 --> 17:40.267
<i>Fuck!</i>

18:08.879 --> 18:10.339
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.465
How's it going?

18:11.465 --> 18:13.425
- Good and you?
- Good.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.386
- Two hundred of them there?
- Your first.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.976
Fuck, I got that shit.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.228
You do?

18:24.228 --> 18:27.147
Well, I ain't got the nice packaging,
it's just the tape.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.484
It showed up in the mail
without the box?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.194
I didn't get it mailed.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.822
How did you get it?

18:36.073 --> 18:37.825
No refunds, pal. No refunds.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.244
Hey, check out the tape
right here, everybody.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.996
Pamela Anderson, right here. Triple X.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.793
I got you. See you next time, huh?

18:48.752 --> 18:50.254
That's what's up.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.466
Hey. You.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.343
Hey, what up, homie?

18:56.343 --> 18:58.220
How much these puppies for?

18:58.220 --> 19:01.640
Hey, for you, one for $30, two for $50.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.271
Mind if I check them out?

19:07.271 --> 19:08.647
Yeah, go ahead, bro.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.399
It's nice, huh?

19:10.524 --> 19:11.733
Good stocking stuffer.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.986
What you're doing is wrong.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.113
Excuse me?

19:16.363 --> 19:17.948
These do not belong to you.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.867
- All right, look, dude...
- No, no.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.244
You look, dude, you have no right
to be selling these.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.121
You are profiting off of somebody else's

19:24.121 --> 19:28.208
considerable risk and labor,
which is probably illegal,

19:28.292 --> 19:29.877
but it's definitely unethical.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.379
So unless you want
a major problem on your hands,

19:32.379 --> 19:34.173
you're gonna pack up your bootleg shit

19:34.173 --> 19:36.842
and you're gonna get out
of the Tower Records parking lot.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.762
Shit.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.723
You're fucking with me, right?

19:42.723 --> 19:45.309
Ah, fuck. What are you, the porn police?

19:45.309 --> 19:47.477
- Maybe I am.
- Mr. Ethical.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.688
Get the fuck out of here, dawg.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.901
Enjoy it while it lasts. This whole
operation's getting shut down, man.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.444
Fuck your mom, sir.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.695
Have a good day.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.533
Fuck!

20:05.662 --> 20:07.372
It's him. Without a doubt.

20:07.456 --> 20:08.749
- Fucking knew it.
- Oh, my God.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.334
Are you sure? How do you know?

20:10.876 --> 20:12.461
One can tell these things.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.463
My God. You're gonna get it back, right?

20:14.922 --> 20:15.964
I'll pop in tomorrow.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.925
You'll probably have it back
by the weekend.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.844
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much, Mr. Pelcano.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.472
We really fucking appreciate it,
you have no idea.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.057
It's fun.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.559
Come here, baby.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.604
Yeah! Yeah!

20:31.355 --> 20:32.564
What did I tell you?

20:32.648 --> 20:34.524
- I know. Yes.
- Yes.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.487
I got to go.
I got a session with the boys.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.905
I'll be back home around 8:00.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.115
Yeah, but I'm shooting late tonight.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.368
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.620
I'm gonna miss you.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.456
Oh, my God.
Not as much as I'll miss you.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.042
Eskimo kiss.

21:10.477 --> 21:11.812
They're ready for you!

21:15.190 --> 21:16.525
Coming.

21:19.820 --> 21:23.365
- Let's do this. Hey, Evander.
- Hey.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.200
- How's it going?
- Everything's good.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.702
- Good weekend?
- Yes, ma'am.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.663
- Yeah? How are those kids of yours?
- Putting them up for adoption.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.707
Yeah, well, give them to me.
Give them to me.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.875
<i>I love you, Pamela!</i>

21:35.043 --> 21:37.504
<i>I love you, Tommy!</i>

21:38.922 --> 21:41.300
<i>Fuck, you are so fine.</i>

21:43.343 --> 21:46.763
<i>Tommy, when you gonna get me preggo?</i>

21:49.850 --> 21:52.769
<i>Look at my beautiful fucking husband!</i>

21:52.853 --> 21:54.855
<i>You're so fucking hot.</i>

22:03.697 --> 22:05.907
<i>Baby, get it in.
- Fuck!</i>

22:06.908 --> 22:08.660
<i>I love you so much.</i>

22:19.671 --> 22:21.631
Right on the drop,
that's where you come in.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.015
Fuck.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.362
Sorry, guys. Could you just
give us a second?

22:43.362 --> 22:44.571
Yeah, come on.

22:48.408 --> 22:49.826
- Now, please.
- Sorry.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.038
Hey, what's up?

22:54.331 --> 22:55.540
He's selling it.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.626
Huh?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.712
He's fucking selling it, Tommy.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.006
One second.

23:03.548 --> 23:04.674
It's our tape.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.554
What the fuck?

23:09.846 --> 23:10.972
Where'd you get this?

23:11.056 --> 23:12.891
They were watching it on set.

23:13.141 --> 23:15.477
I saw a bunch of camera guys

23:15.477 --> 23:17.312
sitting around watching us have sex.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.231
Holy shit.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.191
Jesus.

23:23.151 --> 23:26.780
Do you have any idea
how humiliating it was?

23:27.572 --> 23:28.907
Motherfucker.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.869
I mean, how many copies
of this are out there?

23:33.286 --> 23:35.330
I mean, there could be dozens, hundreds.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.082
What is this?

23:37.916 --> 23:41.586
- What is what?
- This. HTTP...

23:41.670 --> 23:44.423
That's a website, they're making
one for <i>Barb Wire.</i>

23:44.589 --> 23:46.174
This is how he's selling this?

23:46.258 --> 23:48.135
I don't know. I really don't get it.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.263
Do we have a computer?

23:52.222 --> 23:54.057
We have a computer.
It's in the downstairs den,

23:54.182 --> 23:55.434
but we don't have the Web.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.103
It's this thing
you plug your phone into.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.604
Okay, so who has it?

23:59.688 --> 24:00.897
Where do we get the Web?

24:07.404 --> 24:09.781
Sex tape...
Oh, my God.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.701
Then period com.

24:13.702 --> 24:18.498
"O" "M," enter.

24:32.971 --> 24:33.972
What the...

24:36.600 --> 24:37.851
What the hell is this?

24:40.437 --> 24:42.105
- I've no fucking idea.
- Oh, my God.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.940
- Shit.
- Come on, come on.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.025
What are you doing?

24:45.150 --> 24:46.735
I wanna see if there's a phone number.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.529
There's not. I can't see any.
There is no way to reach them.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.824
Wait, look. Purchase.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.743
Shall we click on it?

24:55.702 --> 24:56.870
Enter.

24:57.412 --> 24:58.747
Fuck.

25:00.749 --> 25:01.875
Jesus.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.713
Canada. What?

25:06.713 --> 25:09.466
- He's in LA.
- Yeah.

25:09.966 --> 25:14.596
Well, maybe he's running it
through Canada to avoid getting caught.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.266
It's a co-operation.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.143
It really is.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.938
There's no way
this guy's doing it by himself.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.940
Dumbass couldn't mastermind
ordering a pizza.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.608
So who's helping him, then?

25:26.608 --> 25:27.692
Milton Ingley.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.070
Little local porn producer
out of Van Nuys.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.364
Rand did some features for him
back in the day.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.616
- Anal specialist.
- Jesus.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.911
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:38.328 --> 25:39.704
How did you find this out?

25:39.788 --> 25:41.164
I asked around.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.458
Apparently they pitched it
to half the Valley.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.297
- Hey.
- Oh, my fucking God.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.262
Jesus Christ!

26:00.642 --> 26:02.769
Where the fuck do I find this guy?

26:04.563 --> 26:05.647
The phone book.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.485
Right up here.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.530
Who the fuck is that?

26:20.829 --> 26:22.289
Hey, Tommy.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.682
Miltie.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.810
Miltie, where the fuck are you, man?

26:43.810 --> 26:46.271
Miltie!
He just left.

26:46.646 --> 26:47.689
Where did he go?

26:48.815 --> 26:50.066
I don't know, man.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.156
What are you doing?

26:56.990 --> 26:58.908
Miltie asked me to help out.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.786
You fucking... You know?

27:03.246 --> 27:05.081
- About the tape?
- Yeah.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.958
Totally.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.461
He said not to tell anybody.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.755
I don't know, man.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.301
Could you please get the door for me?
Thank you.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.053
Miltie.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.765
Rand.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.479
- Yo, what...
- Motherfucker. Grab him.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.190
- Yo.
- Let's go have a little chat.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.524
Fuck.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.486
Take a seat.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.121
- Tiny, is this him?
- Nice to meet you, Rand.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.667
Rand? No, that's not me. Rand just...

27:48.667 --> 27:50.001
Shut up!

28:17.654 --> 28:20.031
Come on. Come on.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.077
- Hey, Miltie.
- Rand.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.662
- Thank God.
- What the fuck?

28:25.662 --> 28:29.541
- Where the fuck have you been, dude?
- Well, I've been working from home.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.000
What's up?

28:31.126 --> 28:32.711
Well, there's a lot up.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.630
Okay, Tommy Lee? He's on to us, man.

28:35.714 --> 28:36.756
Some fucking goomba PI

28:36.840 --> 28:39.008
just showed up, he showed up
at my apartment.

28:39.092 --> 28:42.554
He beat the fuck out of me. He told me
that if I didn't give him the tape

28:42.554 --> 28:43.888
he's gonna fucking kill me.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.559
And then a biker gang shows up
at the studio

28:47.559 --> 28:49.477
looking for us, man. And I get away,

28:49.561 --> 28:51.479
but while I'm there,
there's a guy at the studio,

28:51.563 --> 28:54.232
he's working on the operation.
You hired him. You didn't tell me.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.651
You told me not to...
Not to fucking tell anyone, man

28:57.277 --> 28:59.612
And there's a guy

28:59.696 --> 29:02.240
selling the fucking tape
in the Tower Records parking lot.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.867
Two for 50 bucks, man.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.660
It's a good fucking deal!

29:06.953 --> 29:08.329
That's it!

29:11.458 --> 29:12.584
Us.

29:13.501 --> 29:16.087
- What?
- You said Looking for us.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.213
Yeah.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.176
Did you fucking rat me out, Rand?

29:21.176 --> 29:23.219
No, no, of course not, dude, no!

29:23.303 --> 29:24.304
But they mentioned me?

29:24.304 --> 29:25.930
- Did they say my name?
- Of course.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.933
- They showed up at your studio, dude.
- Do you think they followed you?

29:29.017 --> 29:30.727
I don't fucking know. Can I come inside?

29:30.727 --> 29:32.979
No, no, it's very messy.
I really rather you not.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.857
- My place is gross, I don't care.
- How do they know I'm involved?

29:35.857 --> 29:37.275
I have no idea. I don't know.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.860
I don't know anything. I don't know.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.779
Let's just...
Rand, why don't you chill out.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.322
Okay, okay.

29:42.322 --> 29:46.534
Take it easy. Take it easy. I'm gonna
need you to go back to the studio.

29:46.826 --> 29:47.869
What?

29:50.955 --> 29:52.749
The location is compromised.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.626
Okay, baby?

29:54.793 --> 29:55.835
What?

29:56.419 --> 29:58.671
You're gonna need
to clean everything out.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.217
Clean out every last copy
of that movie tape.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.386
Why me?

30:06.805 --> 30:08.139
You're Operations.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.895
Everything's Operations.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.251
He's gone!

30:40.630 --> 30:43.925
Bunnies, come to the bunny patch.

30:45.885 --> 30:47.387
I'm so sorry. Where were we?

30:48.930 --> 30:50.557
I am not your bunny.

30:55.645 --> 30:56.729
What's up?

30:56.813 --> 30:58.940
He's not here. Don't worry.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.900
<i>He'll turn up eventually.</i>
Tommy.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.235
Baby, is that him?

31:02.235 --> 31:03.486
He's not there.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.863
That's not good enough.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.739
Let me talk to him, put him on speaker.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.200
- He's on it. Relax.
- No. I will not relax.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.828
Mr. Pelcano. Hi. This is Pamela. <i>- Hi, Pamela.</i>

31:11.828 --> 31:14.914
Yeah. You need to stop this guy
from selling the tape now.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.000
- This is urgent.
- Hey, you're being crazy.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.837
What? I'm not being crazy,
you're being chill.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.130
You're being way too chill.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.132
Every second that passes,
this tape could be spreading.

31:24.132 --> 31:27.135
Baby, we will get it back, all right?
Every last copy,

31:27.260 --> 31:29.304
it's mail order, they know
who they shipped to.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.723
What about the people that they shipped
it to made copies?

31:31.848 --> 31:33.516
- Come on.
- Just...

31:33.892 --> 31:35.310
I got this, okay?

31:35.310 --> 31:36.603
Let me handle it.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.354
Yeah.

31:39.230 --> 31:42.150
Okay, but you don't seem to understand
what a big deal this is to me.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.527
Like it's not a big deal to me?

31:44.611 --> 31:46.362
I'm on that tape just the same as you.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.906
But this is worse for me.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.908
I mean, this is way worse.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.701
How is this worse for you? Why?

31:51.701 --> 31:54.162
'Cause of your big career?
It's so much bigger than mine?

31:54.162 --> 31:56.623
What? Tommy,
it's not because of my big career,

31:56.623 --> 31:58.207
it's because I'm a woman!

31:59.876 --> 32:02.170
<i>I'm gonna let you guys talk...</i>

32:06.424 --> 32:07.592
Fuck.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.597
Listen to me, okay?

32:13.306 --> 32:15.808
People are going to think you're cool
for this, all right?

32:15.892 --> 32:17.727
They'll be high-fiving you
in the street.

32:17.727 --> 32:20.229
Me, I'm going to get looked
at like a slut by the whole world.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.649
- That's ridiculous.
- It's not. It's true.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.233
You don't know. You have no idea.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.945
You never have to fucking
deal with this stuff. You don't.

32:26.945 --> 32:30.365
I'm on your side. I want to get rid
of the tape just as much as you do.

32:30.365 --> 32:33.117
And we will end this whole thing
I'm telling you,

32:33.284 --> 32:34.786
this will all be fine.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.915
Besides, it's not like they're seeing
anything they haven't seen before.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.085
What did you say?

32:45.171 --> 32:47.799
- I just...
- What the fuck did you just say?

32:47.799 --> 32:49.759
I'm sorry. That came out wrong.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.844
- Oh, my God. Leave.
- What?

32:51.928 --> 32:54.555
- Leave this fucking room right now.
- Pamela.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.849
- Leave this fucking room right now!
- Come on, Pamela.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.434
Get the fuck out!

33:45.356 --> 33:46.607
Fuck.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.615
Fuck. Oh, man.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.507
Hey, Tommy.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.550
Yeah, I feel fine now, Tommy.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.969
You wanna check it out,
you know, just make sure.

34:57.053 --> 35:00.223
I'm telling you I'm good. I'm fine.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.143
- Shit.
- We're gonna be sure, okay?

35:05.394 --> 35:06.562
Yeah, I know.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.649
Fine, everything's fucking fine.

35:13.402 --> 35:14.570
Yep, yep, yep.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.057
You did the right thing by coming in.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.518
I feel much better now.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.020
I'm sure it's nothing.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.106
- Yeah.
- Most likely everything's fine.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.315
Should we call my mom?

36:32.315 --> 36:34.358
I'm going to as soon as we get home.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.278
Hey, man, fuck off.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.828
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on, get the fuck out.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.663
Hey, fuck off!

36:56.923 --> 36:58.299
<i>Hi, this is Rand Gauthier.</i>

36:58.299 --> 37:01.010
<i>Please leave your number,
I'll call you back. Thank you.</i>

37:02.303 --> 37:06.224
<i>Hi, Rand. It's me. Miltie.</i>

37:06.766 --> 37:09.477
<i>Listen, I just wanted to let you know</i>

37:09.477 --> 37:13.022
<i>I'm going to pop on over to Amsterdam</i>

37:13.022 --> 37:15.149
<i>for a few days.</i>

37:15.233 --> 37:16.525
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

37:16.609 --> 37:20.488
<i>Just want to make a few tweaks
to the banking.</i>

37:20.488 --> 37:23.783
<i>Keep the IR,
you know what, off the scent.</i>

37:23.908 --> 37:24.909
Smart.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.828
<i>Anyway, I have no doubt
you will hold down the fort</i>

37:27.912 --> 37:30.873
<i>in my absence.
Great job clearing out the studio.</i>

37:30.957 --> 37:32.208
<i>All right, anyway...</i>

37:54.605 --> 37:57.233
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.526
Fuck. He's not here.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.907
Would you like to see the cocktail menu?

38:05.491 --> 38:06.867
I would love to.

38:20.089 --> 38:21.799
Hey, can I come in?

38:23.217 --> 38:25.136
- Yeah.
- Okay. Thank you.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.407
Hey, Tommy! Give me a smile!

38:46.824 --> 38:48.409
God-fucking-damn it!

38:48.534 --> 38:51.871
You want a fucking picture?
I'll give you a fucking picture!

38:52.913 --> 38:56.834
Fucking...

39:02.048 --> 39:04.717
You fuck!
