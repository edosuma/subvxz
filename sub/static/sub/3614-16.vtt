00:07.969 --> 00:10.085
Everything is shot on
digital now, you know.

00:10.249 --> 00:11.318
Yeah, I'm equipped.

00:11.529 --> 00:12.678
Nice stuff.

00:15.169 --> 00:17.000
Oh, I like this one.

00:17.169 --> 00:19.478
- What lens did you use?
- Twenty-four F8.

00:19.649 --> 00:22.322
- What shutter speed?
- One twenty-five.

00:22.489 --> 00:25.720
Okay, lose the kicker.
Let the shadow play there.

00:31.169 --> 00:34.286
- Impressive.
- So does that mean I got the job?

00:34.769 --> 00:37.124
Based on your portfolio, yes.

00:38.729 --> 00:41.527
Based on your résumé, no.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.881
Took a detour from
shutterbugging, did you?

00:44.049 --> 00:46.961
Mr. Corso, I've changed careers,
I'm not hiding that.

00:47.169 --> 00:49.967
But with all due respect, if you like
my work that should be enough.

00:50.129 --> 00:52.802
I mean you're hiring me,
not my résumé.

00:54.529 --> 00:56.247
You want a shot?

00:57.889 --> 00:59.845
Get me a better one
of Maggie Murphy.

01:00.049 --> 01:02.563
She's gonna be featured
in our St. Patty's Day issue.

01:02.769 --> 01:05.158
Something about being the
unluckiest woman in San Francisco.

01:05.328 --> 01:06.318
And she's Irish.

01:06.489 --> 01:08.764
Down where they do the writing,
they call that irony.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.199
Address is on the back.
Up until three months ago,

01:11.369 --> 01:15.078
she was like a saint, helping the
homeless, volunteering, charity.

01:15.289 --> 01:18.964
Then, like, overnight,
everything started going bad for her.

01:19.169 --> 01:20.158
Real bad.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.682
I want what you have in here, Prue.

01:24.889 --> 01:27.608
Artistic, soulful, poignant.

01:27.809 --> 01:30.243
I want to see the inner Maggie
in your photograph.

01:30.449 --> 01:32.360
And I want to see it by 5:00 today.

01:34.889 --> 01:36.959
Or don't bother coming back.

01:38.209 --> 01:39.961
Thank you.

02:04.489 --> 02:06.605
What am I doing?
This isn't me, this...

02:06.769 --> 02:09.157
Yes, it is. It's all my fault.

02:10.128 --> 02:11.960
The car accident.

02:12.129 --> 02:14.484
The fire. My brother's death.

02:14.689 --> 02:16.998
I hurt the ones I love.

02:17.169 --> 02:18.841
I hurt the ones I love.

02:19.009 --> 02:20.124
I have to stop it.

02:20.889 --> 02:23.039
Has to stop.

02:26.049 --> 02:27.402
I don't deserve to live.

02:27.569 --> 02:29.605
This is who I really am.

02:29.849 --> 02:30.884
Cursed.

02:31.569 --> 02:33.161
I'm cursed.

02:33.609 --> 02:34.758
Hey, look up there!

02:40.649 --> 02:42.958
Oh, my God, she's gonna jump!

03:03.089 --> 03:04.727
Maggie?

03:06.569 --> 03:08.207
Maggie, no!

03:09.769 --> 03:10.997
Maggie.

03:11.809 --> 03:12.798
Wait, don't.

03:12.969 --> 03:14.687
Where did you come from?
How do you know me?

03:15.089 --> 03:17.649
It doesn't matter. Just step away
from the ledge and take my hand.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.726
Stay away from me.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.207
Maggie, please, I can help you.

03:23.569 --> 03:25.082
Nobody can help me.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.563
Maggie, this isn't the answer.

03:27.569 --> 03:30.527
All I wanted to do is help people.

03:31.449 --> 03:33.280
Now all I do is hurt them.

03:36.529 --> 03:38.121
Maggie!

03:44.489 --> 03:46.844
Let me go. Please.

03:47.049 --> 03:49.438
I can't hold on much longer.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.961
No.

04:09.329 --> 04:10.364
Bring it over here.

04:10.569 --> 04:13.083
Wait. Wait.

04:18.048 --> 04:21.007
Well, of all the luck.

04:21.209 --> 04:22.437
Just stay still, ma'am.

05:48.409 --> 05:49.603
Hey.

05:49.809 --> 05:51.800
I thought you had inventory
at the club.

05:51.969 --> 05:53.038
I do.

05:53.209 --> 05:54.801
So then what are you doing here?

05:55.329 --> 05:57.889
Trying to figure out what to tell Dan.

05:58.049 --> 05:59.607
About what, honey?

05:59.809 --> 06:00.798
Leo.

06:01.009 --> 06:03.921
Oh, that. You're not actually writing
him a Dear John letter, are you?

06:04.129 --> 06:08.759
No, of course not. He deserves
more than that, a lot more. But...

06:08.929 --> 06:11.238
It's just hard.
I mean, I don't want to hurt him.

06:11.849 --> 06:14.079
Dan's a great guy,
and he's been really good to me.

06:14.289 --> 06:17.122
And we've never really had
any huge problems.

06:17.289 --> 06:20.201
No, I mean, the only huge problem
is that you really love Leo,

06:20.409 --> 06:22.286
and he loves you,

06:22.449 --> 06:24.041
and he gave up immortality for you.

06:24.289 --> 06:29.443
I know, which is obviously good for us.
But lately, he seems a bit restless.

06:29.649 --> 06:31.128
You're thinking too much again.

06:31.329 --> 06:35.083
Stop trying to predict the future,
all right? That's my job.

06:35.249 --> 06:38.047
Just follow your heart, honey.
Good things will happen.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.719
What would I do without you?

06:41.929 --> 06:43.408
Oh, suffer endlessly, no doubt.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.402
Thank you.
All right, I'm going to the club.

06:47.289 --> 06:50.565
- Love you.
- I love you too.

06:56.409 --> 06:59.242
- Miss Murphy?
- I can't go in there.

07:00.089 --> 07:01.408
You don't really have a choice.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.642
Am I being arrested?

07:04.409 --> 07:07.128
No, but there's some paperwork
we have to get started.

07:09.169 --> 07:10.238
Are there guns in there?

07:14.449 --> 07:16.121
It's a police station.

07:16.289 --> 07:18.849
They might go off.
Things like that happen around me,

07:19.009 --> 07:21.284
and I don't want anybody
to get hurt.

07:22.649 --> 07:24.799
I'm more concerned
about you hurting yourself.

07:26.409 --> 07:27.888
Come on.

07:28.089 --> 07:30.808
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- You don't understand.

07:31.489 --> 07:34.128
Trust me.
We're only here to help you.

07:34.289 --> 07:36.359
You can't help me.

07:36.529 --> 07:38.201
Nobody can.

07:41.609 --> 07:44.169
We're gonna find
somebody who can.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.688
First, you have to answer a few
questions about what happened today.

07:47.849 --> 07:49.123
I don't know what happened.

07:49.409 --> 07:51.604
It was like a bad dream,
only it wasn't.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.198
Voices in my head...

07:54.369 --> 07:56.166
...and everything spinning.

07:56.849 --> 07:59.443
Is there somebody you wanna call?
Family, friends?

07:59.609 --> 08:02.567
No, no, no. Keep them away from me.
They're safer there.

08:02.769 --> 08:04.327
I shouldn't even be here.

08:04.729 --> 08:07.197
I shouldn't be alive, and if it
hadn't been for that angel...

08:08.809 --> 08:12.518
- Excuse me?
- She just appeared.

08:12.689 --> 08:14.998
Out of thin air
when I was on the rooftop.

08:15.489 --> 08:18.959
She reached out her hand, and then
when I was falling, it was like...

08:19.129 --> 08:22.519
Something slowed me down,
like she guided me to that awning.

08:22.689 --> 08:24.884
- The angel?
- Yes, she saved me.

08:29.889 --> 08:31.038
Help me out here.

08:31.369 --> 08:34.884
What exactly
did this woman look like?

08:40.929 --> 08:41.998
So how'd it go?

08:42.208 --> 08:44.484
- What?
- The interview. Did you get the job?

08:44.689 --> 08:46.122
Yeah, I did.

08:46.689 --> 08:49.328
- Prue, are you okay?
- The woman that I am supposed

08:49.489 --> 08:51.127
to photograph,
when I got to her apartment,

08:51.289 --> 08:52.881
she was on the roof, ready to jump.

08:54.129 --> 08:57.405
- Oh, my God. She didn't...
- Yeah, actually she did.

08:57.609 --> 09:01.397
Luckily, I was able to break her fall
with my powers, but just barely.

09:03.329 --> 09:05.081
So lucky you got there in time.

09:05.809 --> 09:06.878
Yeah, but I keep thinking

09:07.049 --> 09:09.279
if I had been a minute later,
it would have been too late.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.804
But you weren't. You were
supposed to be there in time.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.608
You were supposed to save
that girl's life, I believe that.

09:18.129 --> 09:20.120
- Hello?
- Hi, Prue.

09:20.329 --> 09:24.242
You weren't outside 413 N. Fergis Ave
this morning, were you?

09:24.409 --> 09:25.558
Why?

09:25.769 --> 09:27.248
I got a Maggie Murphy here.

09:27.449 --> 09:30.407
She claims that she was saved
by some angel this morning.

09:30.609 --> 09:33.601
An angel that, by her description,
bears no resemblance to Della Reese.

09:33.809 --> 09:35.925
- But does resemble me.
- Yeah, bingo.

09:36.129 --> 09:39.246
Everybody around here thinks she's
nuts. Wish I could tell them otherwise.

09:39.409 --> 09:41.127
Hey, what's on this roll?

09:41.329 --> 09:42.398
Just some old photographs.

09:44.249 --> 09:46.809
- Darryl, is Maggie all right?
- It's not for me to say.

09:47.009 --> 09:50.399
We have to send her over to Psych
for a mandatory 72-hour stay.

09:50.969 --> 09:52.721
I'm so sorry.

09:53.809 --> 09:56.198
Poor woman. It's like she's
snakebit or something.

09:56.409 --> 09:58.559
Listen, Prue,
you'd better steer clear of here

09:58.729 --> 10:02.483
so she doesn't ID you.
I'll keep you posted, okay? Bye.

10:06.009 --> 10:08.079
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go see Maggie.

10:08.249 --> 10:11.161
Something tells me that I may have
stopped her, but I didn't save her.

10:11.329 --> 10:14.366
I'll come with you. Maybe something
from my psych class could be of use.

10:14.529 --> 10:16.281
Cool, thanks.

10:20.009 --> 10:22.125
That can't be right.
How many swizzle sticks?

10:22.769 --> 10:23.758
Who's counting?

10:25.849 --> 10:27.362
I don't know. A lot.

10:27.569 --> 10:29.002
You think you might
have over-ordered?

10:29.169 --> 10:32.479
- No, they over-shipped.
- Here.

10:36.769 --> 10:37.918
It's my fault.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.848
- What?
- Nothing.

10:49.729 --> 10:50.957
Piper, are you mad at me?

10:52.689 --> 10:54.839
No, don't be ridiculous.
Why would I be mad at you?

10:55.009 --> 10:57.079
I don't know, that's why I'm asking.

10:58.009 --> 10:59.442
What is it?

10:59.849 --> 11:01.965
It's just...

11:02.289 --> 11:03.722
It's Dan.

11:07.009 --> 11:08.965
Never mind, sorry I asked.

11:09.969 --> 11:13.723
And he's going to be...

11:14.689 --> 11:20.002
He's going to be very upset
when he finds out...

11:22.569 --> 11:25.003
...you're the one that I really love.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.197
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:37.809 --> 11:40.960
- No, wait, we can't do this.
- But you just said that...

11:41.129 --> 11:46.203
I know, but I really need
to talk to Dan first.

11:48.169 --> 11:49.238
So count.

11:50.089 --> 11:52.478
- Count.
- Count.

11:54.329 --> 11:55.318
Count.

12:35.769 --> 12:37.805
Brought you some coffee.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.324
- Thanks.
- I'll take it from here. Thanks.

12:40.929 --> 12:42.567
Okay.

12:47.569 --> 12:49.480
I saw her, you know?

12:50.849 --> 12:52.328
The angel, she saved me.

12:55.009 --> 12:57.921
I believe you, Maggie. Really, I do.

12:58.849 --> 13:00.680
- Here.
- Thanks.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.844
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm okay.

13:05.609 --> 13:07.565
I'm just gonna wipe this off.

13:08.849 --> 13:10.407
Maybe you should
just stay away from me.

13:12.649 --> 13:14.162
People get hurt.

13:26.609 --> 13:29.123
All right, that's her.

13:29.329 --> 13:31.968
Any idea what you're gonna say
to her about the whole angel thing?

13:32.129 --> 13:34.359
I'm not really worried about that.
I'm worried about her.

13:35.209 --> 13:37.165
I've been thinking
maybe I can write a spell.

13:37.369 --> 13:40.008
- A spell for what?
- Help put good luck back in her life.

13:40.169 --> 13:43.241
That's sweet, but you know you can't
keep using your powers to save her.

13:43.449 --> 13:45.326
I know. Maybe it'll help her
turn things around,

13:45.489 --> 13:47.241
make her see that life's worth living.

13:57.209 --> 13:58.324
Thanks a lot.

14:00.009 --> 14:01.328
Okay, you see?

14:03.809 --> 14:05.765
All right, I'll need your help.
How do I do this?

14:05.969 --> 14:07.721
You don't need my help.
It's your connection.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.845
It just has to come from the heart.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.087
All right. Here it goes.

14:12.649 --> 14:15.641
From this moment on
Your pain is erased

14:15.809 --> 14:17.959
Your bad luck as well

14:18.129 --> 14:22.361
Enjoy your good luck, Maggie
You're free from this hell

14:45.729 --> 14:47.128
Thanks.

14:47.449 --> 14:50.088
Did I just do that? I mean, help you?

14:50.249 --> 14:52.319
Looks like
her luck's changing already.

14:52.529 --> 14:54.406
Yeah. Have a seat.

14:56.809 --> 14:59.926
- You okay?
- Yeah.

15:00.129 --> 15:01.608
Let's get out of here.

15:04.409 --> 15:06.365
Not so fast.

15:08.849 --> 15:12.524
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, just a chill.

15:17.089 --> 15:20.240
I gotta tell you, for your first spell,
you packed quite a punch.

15:20.409 --> 15:24.641
Well, you told me to speak
from the heart. I did.

15:24.809 --> 15:28.722
Still, it took me a few times
before my first spell actually worked.

15:28.889 --> 15:30.004
Really?

15:30.169 --> 15:32.637
Well, must be my lucky day.

15:42.289 --> 15:45.326
Phoebe? Phoebe.

15:47.969 --> 15:51.041
Your turn to be cursed, witch.

15:58.689 --> 16:00.281
Piper, I'm going crazy here.

16:00.689 --> 16:02.281
- We're almost done.
- That's not what I mean.

16:02.489 --> 16:05.287
Look, you can't come in here
and tell me what you told me

16:05.449 --> 16:07.121
and expect me to act
like nothing's changed.

16:07.329 --> 16:09.399
- Everything's changed.
- I know. Believe me, I know.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.605
But Dan is out of town,
and until he comes back...

16:11.809 --> 16:13.561
When? When is he coming back?

16:14.129 --> 16:15.687
Next Thursday.

16:15.889 --> 16:18.483
A week? Oh, God.
Can you call him or something?

16:19.489 --> 16:20.808
Never mind, that's not right.

16:22.169 --> 16:26.128
It's just... You know, I've been waiting
for this, for us, for so long.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.642
And I just...

16:27.809 --> 16:29.447
I don't wanna wait any longer.

16:31.049 --> 16:33.847
- Piper, you there?
- Prue?

16:34.369 --> 16:36.519
What...? What happened?

16:36.689 --> 16:38.327
We got in a car accident.
I wasn't looking.

16:38.489 --> 16:39.763
- You guys okay?
- We're fine.

16:39.929 --> 16:41.567
- Phoebe's got a concussion.
- A mild one.

16:41.969 --> 16:44.005
Still, the doctor said that,
you know, you should...

16:44.169 --> 16:46.125
The doctor? You went
to the hospital? Phoebe, you...

16:46.289 --> 16:48.120
I'm fine, really.
I just have a little headache.

16:48.329 --> 16:50.160
We've got some aspirin
around here somewhere.

16:50.369 --> 16:53.088
- Phoebe, I'm so sorry.
- Prue, it's okay, it was an accident.

16:53.249 --> 16:54.364
It wasn't your fault.

16:54.569 --> 16:57.606
Yeah, but you know what, I should
have been looking. I always look first.

16:59.129 --> 17:01.689
At least I didn't put you
in the hospital this time.

17:02.169 --> 17:03.841
Your lipstick's smeared.

17:04.569 --> 17:06.161
It is?

17:15.368 --> 17:18.645
- Don't worry about it, I got it. I got it.
- Okay. I am such a klutz.

17:18.809 --> 17:20.925
I can't seem to do anything
right all of a sudden.

17:21.089 --> 17:23.125
Do you think that that spell
backfired on me?

17:23.289 --> 17:26.326
- Not possible, no personal gain.
- What spell?

17:29.529 --> 17:31.247
Hello.

17:31.449 --> 17:34.202
Yeah, Mr. Corso, there was a
problem with the photograph.

17:34.409 --> 17:37.401
Prue got this gig photographing
this girl named Maggie Murphy.

17:37.569 --> 17:39.127
The unlucky Maggie Murphy?

17:39.289 --> 17:42.326
- I'm sorry. Is there anything...?
- I saw a piece on her on TV.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.406
Well, she's not unlucky anymore.

17:44.609 --> 17:46.839
Prue cast a spell
to turn her luck around

17:47.009 --> 17:49.204
after she saved her
from jumping off a roof.

17:49.849 --> 17:51.760
- What?
- Yeah, pretty scary, huh?

17:51.969 --> 17:53.766
- That's more than scary.
- I understand.

17:53.929 --> 17:57.126
- It got to Prue too. Big time.
- Okay. Goodbye.

17:58.489 --> 18:01.162
All right, Mr. Corso said if I don't
get that photograph of Maggie,

18:01.329 --> 18:04.366
I can kiss my career goodbye.
Like that's what I wanna do right now.

18:04.569 --> 18:06.525
Well, it's a good excuse
to go check up on her.

18:06.689 --> 18:09.761
Yeah, I'm just gonna stop by
the house, pick up my things...

18:10.969 --> 18:12.084
It's okay.

18:12.289 --> 18:15.247
I'll drive because you didn't
get collision on the rental.

18:15.409 --> 18:16.842
- Here, you want the keys?
- Yes.

18:17.049 --> 18:18.562
Here.

18:18.729 --> 18:19.718
Thank you.

18:23.929 --> 18:25.157
What? I'll clean it up.

18:25.369 --> 18:29.157
No, it's not that. I was just thinking
about Maggie Murphy.

18:29.729 --> 18:31.048
What about her?

18:31.249 --> 18:33.717
It's just that she was doing all
these good things in her life,

18:33.889 --> 18:36.164
and then, all of a sudden,
her own life goes to hell.

18:36.729 --> 18:38.685
- So what?
- I don't know.

18:38.849 --> 18:43.764
What if, you know, all these accidents
in her life weren't actually accidents?

18:43.969 --> 18:46.642
I mean, what if something
was trying to make her jump?

18:46.809 --> 18:48.128
Something like...?

18:48.649 --> 18:50.287
Like a darklighter, maybe.

18:54.609 --> 18:56.201
It's okay, Mrs. Sidelman.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.927
Let's just get you out
into the sunlight

18:58.089 --> 19:00.478
and let you see
what's going on in the world, okay?

19:00.649 --> 19:02.401
That's it. You're doing fine.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.998
Maggie has made
a remarkable turnaround.

19:05.169 --> 19:06.727
Severely depressed this morning,

19:06.889 --> 19:10.768
now, suddenly, she's smiling,
laughing, helping others.

19:10.929 --> 19:15.320
However, I'm afraid her recovery
is only temporary.

19:15.489 --> 19:17.366
Why do you say that?

19:17.609 --> 19:20.328
Once you've been on that ledge,
Miss Halliwell,

19:20.529 --> 19:22.645
you can never forget it.

19:22.809 --> 19:25.767
That deep, dark place
never goes away.

19:25.969 --> 19:28.608
It haunts you, beckons you back.

19:28.889 --> 19:31.847
- That's not true.
- Oh, are you a psychiatrist?

19:32.049 --> 19:34.199
No, but I still don't think
that that's true.

19:34.689 --> 19:36.600
Lots of people
recover from depression.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.369
Not people in Maggie's
rather unique situation.

19:39.569 --> 19:43.801
She still feels responsible for all
of the tragedies in her family's life.

19:44.009 --> 19:45.965
That pain doesn't just...

19:46.129 --> 19:47.801
...magically go away.

19:51.289 --> 19:53.962
- May we see her?
- Of course.

20:11.729 --> 20:13.765
- You're doing great.
- Thank you.

20:15.329 --> 20:16.557
I'll be right back, okay?

20:16.769 --> 20:19.329
- You'll be fine.
- Okay.

20:20.529 --> 20:22.724
I hoped you'd come
so I could thank you.

20:22.929 --> 20:24.681
And ask you...

20:24.849 --> 20:26.123
I have so many questions.

20:27.289 --> 20:30.361
Maggie, I think that you may have
the wrong idea about me.

20:30.569 --> 20:31.638
You saved my life.

20:31.849 --> 20:34.488
There was so much going on this
morning. It was really confusing,

20:34.649 --> 20:37.322
- there were so many people.
- That doesn't change what you did.

20:38.769 --> 20:39.838
Who are you?

20:40.529 --> 20:42.485
My name is Prue.

20:42.889 --> 20:45.357
- This is my sister Phoebe.
- Hi, Maggie.

20:45.689 --> 20:48.965
- Two angels.
- Oh, no, I'm just a student.

20:49.129 --> 20:51.165
Maggie, how are you feeling?
Better, I hope.

20:51.369 --> 20:53.280
Honestly?

20:53.609 --> 20:55.884
I feel great. I couldn't be happier.

20:56.169 --> 20:58.967
- Even though you're here?
- I'm alive.

20:59.129 --> 21:01.768
And more importantly,
I feel alive again.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.721
I'm able to give.
I'm able to help people.

21:04.769 --> 21:06.964
I haven't been able
to do that for a while.

21:07.169 --> 21:08.488
That's really sweet.

21:10.649 --> 21:11.764
Are you a photographer?

21:13.329 --> 21:14.842
Yeah. Sort of...

21:15.049 --> 21:17.802
Yes, she is.
She's working for 415 Magazine.

21:17.969 --> 21:21.518
Oh, yeah,
they're doing an article on me.

21:21.729 --> 21:25.278
Is that why you were at my place
this morning, to take my picture?

21:25.449 --> 21:28.009
Yeah. But believe me,
that was the last thing on my mind.

21:28.169 --> 21:31.127
No, no, no. It's fine.
Maybe the article will help others.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.564
Help them realize
not to give up either.

21:35.529 --> 21:37.008
Where do you want me?

21:38.729 --> 21:41.926
I guess here is fine.

21:43.329 --> 21:44.842
Here you go.

21:45.849 --> 21:48.727
I just can't get over how
everything's changed suddenly.

21:48.929 --> 21:51.568
I mean, I know I'm stuck here
for a while,

21:51.729 --> 21:54.448
but I feel like a 1000-pound weight's
been lifted off me.

21:54.889 --> 21:57.278
I feel like my old self again.

21:58.289 --> 22:00.962
Maggie, I'm taking
a psychology class in school,

22:01.129 --> 22:03.279
and I was wondering
if I could ask you a question.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.127
Sure, anything.

22:05.289 --> 22:07.200
I was wondering why you...

22:09.209 --> 22:10.324
How...?

22:10.489 --> 22:13.287
- How did I get on the ledge?
- Yeah.

22:13.489 --> 22:16.162
I really don't know, actually.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.360
All I know is
I just wanted it all to stop.

22:18.569 --> 22:19.968
You wanted what to stop?

22:21.569 --> 22:24.766
The voice in my head that kept
telling me I was hurting people,

22:24.969 --> 22:29.679
not helping them. That I was causing
pain and trouble wherever I went.

22:30.609 --> 22:32.247
That it was all my fault.

22:38.369 --> 22:39.518
It's like...

22:40.049 --> 22:41.721
...I was...

22:42.129 --> 22:43.198
...cursed.

22:44.369 --> 22:45.688
Maybe you were cursed.

22:45.889 --> 22:47.561
I'm sorry, what was...?

22:48.609 --> 22:50.088
Prue?

22:51.089 --> 22:53.000
I have to go get these
to the magazine right away.

22:53.169 --> 22:56.366
- Did you just hear what she said?
- Yeah, look, can you take a cab

22:56.529 --> 22:58.440
- and take that home for me?
- Why don't I drive you?

22:58.609 --> 23:00.327
No, it's fine.

23:00.769 --> 23:02.760
- Bye, Maggie.
- Bye.

23:08.249 --> 23:11.639
There's a whole section in here
on darklighters somewhere.

23:11.809 --> 23:13.481
Somebody should
really index this thing.

23:13.649 --> 23:14.764
Are you sure about this?

23:14.969 --> 23:16.880
Piper, I've been a whitelighter
for over 50 years.

23:17.049 --> 23:18.368
Okay.

23:18.609 --> 23:20.918
It's just Prue's in trouble.

23:22.209 --> 23:24.245
Maybe that's her.

23:26.529 --> 23:29.441
- Hello, Prue?
- No, it's me, Dan.

23:30.609 --> 23:33.169
- Dan. Hi.
- You miss me?

23:34.449 --> 23:36.041
- No.
- Really?

23:37.729 --> 23:39.082
I was talking to the cat.

23:39.689 --> 23:40.678
Are you in New York?

23:40.849 --> 23:44.478
Yeah, I'm in my hotel room.
So, what are you doing?

23:45.009 --> 23:46.488
Just reading.

23:46.689 --> 23:49.078
- How was your flight?
- It was fine.

23:50.489 --> 23:53.845
Hey, listen, maybe it's
just my imagination,

23:54.049 --> 23:56.279
but I sensed a little...

23:57.689 --> 23:59.008
...something going on.

23:59.169 --> 24:01.524
Or not going on at all,
if that makes any sense.

24:02.409 --> 24:03.603
Everything's fine.

24:03.769 --> 24:07.239
So that feeling that you had
something important to tell me

24:07.449 --> 24:10.282
but didn't want to ruin my trip,
that's just all in my head?

24:10.969 --> 24:12.482
Piper?

24:13.289 --> 24:16.804
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm a little distracted here.

24:17.009 --> 24:18.283
Can we talk when you get home?

24:18.449 --> 24:20.485
Right. Hey, listen, you know what,

24:20.649 --> 24:22.924
you don't have to worry about
picking me up at the airport.

24:23.089 --> 24:25.842
I'll just catch a cab back to my place,
maybe we can go out to dinner.

24:27.209 --> 24:28.358
Great.

24:28.849 --> 24:31.079
Okay. I'll see you soon.

24:31.529 --> 24:32.518
Okay, bye.

24:33.329 --> 24:34.364
Bye.

24:39.369 --> 24:41.564
I'm sorry. It's difficult.

24:42.009 --> 24:46.207
I am going to break up with him, but I
can't do it when he's 3000 miles away.

24:46.369 --> 24:47.688
I have to be fair to him.

24:48.129 --> 24:51.360
I understand that totally. I really do.

24:52.049 --> 24:54.279
You know, I'm glad
that you're the kind of person

24:54.449 --> 24:56.758
that would give him
that kind of respect.

24:57.689 --> 24:58.758
Thank you.

25:00.129 --> 25:02.359
Now, here's what I'm
really worried about.

25:03.329 --> 25:04.523
Read this.

25:07.609 --> 25:09.406
You've got to be kidding.

25:11.409 --> 25:14.924
I don't understand. I checked it
in my camera myself. It was fine.

25:15.409 --> 25:17.798
What am I supposed to print
with the article?

25:17.969 --> 25:20.324
What am I supposed to do, huh?

25:20.529 --> 25:22.008
I'm sorry.

25:22.809 --> 25:24.481
You're sorry?

25:25.169 --> 25:27.637
I gave you a chance.
I believed in you.

25:27.809 --> 25:28.878
And this is what I get?

25:29.089 --> 25:31.284
- You're a fraud.
- Wait a second, look...

25:31.489 --> 25:33.445
No, you look. Lady, you're fired.

25:33.649 --> 25:37.039
No, you're worse than fired. I will
make sure nobody hires you again.

25:38.529 --> 25:40.997
Now, go on, get out.
Go screw up somebody else's life.

25:48.489 --> 25:54.041
Wait. I can handle this.
Everything's gonna be fine.

25:57.209 --> 26:00.087
No, it's not. He's right.

26:00.249 --> 26:02.126
I'm a fraud.

26:02.289 --> 26:04.564
- I only hurt people.
- No.

26:05.609 --> 26:09.488
It's all my fault. I'm responsible.

26:18.809 --> 26:21.448
- Hi.
- Phoebe, where's Prue?

26:21.609 --> 26:24.760
- Probably at the magazine, why?
- There may be a darklighter after her.

26:24.929 --> 26:26.806
- We need to find her fast.
- What?

26:26.969 --> 26:29.563
Was the car wreck right after
Prue cast the spell on Maggie?

26:29.729 --> 26:31.367
- Yeah, why?
- A darklighter

26:31.529 --> 26:34.043
- must have seen her cast it.
- Why isn't this going through?

26:34.249 --> 26:36.524
- Maggie thought that she was cursed.
- She probably was,

26:36.729 --> 26:38.242
until Prue turned her luck around.

26:38.449 --> 26:40.565
See, there's a certain
type of darklighter

26:40.769 --> 26:42.839
that drives future whitelighters
to commit suicide.

26:43.049 --> 26:44.641
- What do you mean?
- The only way to keep

26:44.809 --> 26:47.528
a whitelighter from becoming one
is to have them take their own life.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.247
To lose their souls forever.

26:49.449 --> 26:52.407
They curse them. They bring
their victims self-doubt,

26:52.569 --> 26:54.799
bad luck, the kind
that hurts other people.

26:55.009 --> 26:57.079
Then reinforce that by
preying on their thoughts,

26:57.249 --> 26:59.240
make them think they're
responsible for all the pain

26:59.409 --> 27:00.398
when they're actually not.

27:00.609 --> 27:03.840
- That's not suicide, that's murder.
- Well, not technically.

27:04.049 --> 27:07.962
They never actually push their victims,
they just always compel them to jump.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.808
So Prue didn't save Maggie from
herself, Prue saved Maggie from him.

27:11.289 --> 27:12.768
What is wrong with her phone?

27:12.929 --> 27:14.806
And that's why the darklighter
is after Prue.

27:15.089 --> 27:17.398
If he destroys Prue,
he destroys the good-luck spell

27:17.569 --> 27:19.161
and leaves Maggie unprotected.

27:19.889 --> 27:21.607
Well, he's not gonna get to Prue.

27:21.769 --> 27:24.727
- I don't care what he tries.
- Phoebe, he knows her thoughts.

27:24.929 --> 27:26.760
He can make her think
anything he wants her to.

27:27.089 --> 27:30.126
Piper, this is Prue that we're
talking about, okay? She is so...

27:31.969 --> 27:33.482
She wouldn't even think of...

27:41.729 --> 27:44.289
- What?
- You guys are right.

27:44.449 --> 27:45.518
We have to get to Prue.

27:53.329 --> 27:56.446
The cellular subscriber you are trying
to reach is not in the calling area.

27:56.609 --> 28:00.158
The cellular subscriber is too
in the calling area. Damn it.

28:00.329 --> 28:01.523
Try calling the magazine.

28:01.689 --> 28:03.964
I already did. They said
she left a half an hour ago.

28:04.129 --> 28:05.642
Okay, then. Keep trying her cell.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.369
Are you sure your vision
was of the past and not the future?

28:08.529 --> 28:10.838
- Positive.
- Could you tell how old she was?

28:11.009 --> 28:13.204
Around 20.

28:13.369 --> 28:15.803
It was the same time
that we had that other accident.

28:16.689 --> 28:18.042
What happened?

28:18.249 --> 28:21.480
Prue was driving,
and she ran a red light.

28:21.689 --> 28:24.647
- We didn't hear the other car honk.
- Phoebe was the only one hurt.

28:24.809 --> 28:27.801
She was in the hospital for over a
week. It scared the hell out of us.

28:28.009 --> 28:30.762
- And Prue never forgave herself.
- It was a really rough time for her.

28:30.929 --> 28:33.568
- For all of us, actually.
- Why?

28:33.769 --> 28:35.168
Well, Phoebe and I
were teenagers

28:35.329 --> 28:37.604
and Grams was
extremely overprotective.

28:37.769 --> 28:39.122
But she was hardest on Prue.

28:39.569 --> 28:43.323
She made Prue take care of us.
She didn't let Prue go away to school.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.799
She wanted to go back East
to be a photojournalist.

28:46.969 --> 28:48.960
But Grams knew that we were
going to become witches,

28:49.129 --> 28:51.518
and she wasn't gonna let
anything jeopardize that.

28:51.729 --> 28:54.801
Still, you know what, I don't
care what was happening,

28:54.969 --> 28:58.279
- Prue would never even consider...
- I know, but you saw her.

28:58.449 --> 29:01.521
Okay, what I saw
was Prue taking a picture,

29:01.689 --> 29:03.486
and she was very sad,
but that doesn't mean

29:03.649 --> 29:05.048
that she was actually gonna jump.

29:05.249 --> 29:08.366
Yeah, but the darklighter will make
her think that she was going to.

29:08.529 --> 29:12.238
He'll mess with her head and try and
take her back to that same dark place.

29:12.729 --> 29:14.082
Then he'll say whatever he has to

29:14.249 --> 29:16.604
and make her do something
she would never otherwise do.

29:17.649 --> 29:20.561
Okay, so if we can't find Prue,
how do we find the darklighter?

29:20.769 --> 29:22.646
You can't without a whitelighter.

29:23.369 --> 29:24.722
They sense each other.

29:27.929 --> 29:30.523
- Prue?
- Hey, Pheebs.

29:30.729 --> 29:32.082
- Is it her?
- Yeah.

29:32.249 --> 29:34.638
- Where are you?
- I don't really know,

29:34.809 --> 29:40.759
but I can't start my car,
and this day just really sucks.

29:40.969 --> 29:43.688
None of what's happened today
has anything to do with...

29:43.889 --> 29:46.801
- Hello?
- Prue, can you hear me?

29:47.009 --> 29:48.727
Barely.

29:48.889 --> 29:53.405
Look, I lost my job, and can you guys
just please come and get me?

29:53.609 --> 29:56.646
- Tell her about the darklighter.
- I'm trying. Prue?

29:56.809 --> 29:59.482
Phoebe, I can't hear you.

30:02.769 --> 30:04.441
Hello?

30:05.089 --> 30:06.647
Damn it.

30:07.769 --> 30:08.838
I lost her.

30:23.849 --> 30:25.441
Okay, what do we do?
We have to find her.

30:25.609 --> 30:29.079
- Well, where do we start?
- We start at the magazine.

30:29.249 --> 30:31.399
Backtrack from the magazine.
That's where she was last.

30:31.969 --> 30:33.448
She could be anywhere.

30:33.649 --> 30:35.799
How about the Book of Shadows?
You could try scrying.

30:36.009 --> 30:37.647
I don't think
we have the time for that.

30:37.849 --> 30:40.522
Well, maybe we need a little luck.
A little good luck.

30:41.449 --> 30:43.724
- Maggie?
- We need a map.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.123
Okay, I'll meet you at the car.

30:45.289 --> 30:47.849
- All right, I'm going with you.
- No, somebody has to stay here

30:48.009 --> 30:49.886
- in case she comes back.
- Piper...

30:50.049 --> 30:52.165
If we find her,
the darklighter will be there too.

30:52.329 --> 30:53.478
And if he recognizes you...

30:53.689 --> 30:57.398
Piper, I hate this, all right. I hate
not being able to look after you guys.

30:58.129 --> 30:59.767
I know.

31:00.169 --> 31:01.522
I'm sorry. I know.

31:08.129 --> 31:10.962
What's happening to me?
What's the matter with me?

31:11.169 --> 31:13.444
I gotta keep moving. Keep walking.

31:13.649 --> 31:16.288
I've been in this dark place before.
I remember.

31:16.489 --> 31:18.798
No one can help me. I'm all alone.

31:19.249 --> 31:22.207
Keep walking. Yes, keep walking.

31:22.409 --> 31:26.118
Okay, Prue, keep it together.

31:26.289 --> 31:29.247
This isn't me. I'm a good person.

31:29.649 --> 31:31.446
I do good things.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.842
Are you okay?

31:52.289 --> 31:53.768
Oh, God.

31:54.649 --> 31:56.844
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- My leg.

31:58.409 --> 32:02.322
I almost got him killed. Just like
how I almost got Phoebe killed.

32:05.129 --> 32:06.847
Run. Run.

32:12.529 --> 32:15.327
Gin. That's great, Mrs. Sidelman.

32:15.649 --> 32:19.278
- Maggie. Hi. Remember me?
- Of course.

32:19.489 --> 32:21.047
We need your help finding Prue.

32:21.529 --> 32:23.520
- Prue?
- Your angel.

32:23.689 --> 32:26.283
She's in trouble. Big trouble.

32:31.969 --> 32:35.518
- The kind of trouble you can relate to.
- What can I do?

32:35.689 --> 32:38.249
We need you to point anywhere
on this map.

32:38.409 --> 32:39.967
We need a little of your luck.

32:40.129 --> 32:43.917
- But I don't understand how that...
- Please. It'll help, trust me.

32:48.489 --> 32:50.081
Here.

32:53.929 --> 32:55.442
It's close by.

32:56.409 --> 32:57.842
Thank you.

33:28.649 --> 33:30.640
It's okay.

33:30.809 --> 33:33.118
No need to be afraid.

33:33.609 --> 33:36.169
I know what needs to be done.

33:36.809 --> 33:39.004
It's the best thing.

33:39.169 --> 33:41.683
The best thing for everyone.

33:43.529 --> 33:47.442
It's something I should have done
a long time ago.

33:49.849 --> 33:50.964
Jump.

34:06.889 --> 34:09.119
That's it.

34:09.329 --> 34:13.083
That's right. That's the only way.

34:13.289 --> 34:15.849
That's the only way
to save the ones I love.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.922
I should have done it before.

34:22.489 --> 34:23.967
Eight years ago.

34:24.529 --> 34:25.563
But I didn't want to.

34:25.728 --> 34:29.085
But if I had, loved ones
would still be alive today.

34:29.969 --> 34:32.119
Like Andy.

34:32.329 --> 34:34.239
I'm responsible for Andy.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.205
Andy.

34:39.449 --> 34:41.643
It's all my fault.

34:44.009 --> 34:45.647
Jump.

34:46.728 --> 34:48.400
Jump.

34:59.849 --> 35:02.158
There's gotta be something in here.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.125
Damn it.

35:06.929 --> 35:09.284
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

35:09.449 --> 35:10.438
Think, think.

35:18.649 --> 35:20.605
Give me my powers back.

35:21.169 --> 35:23.683
I want my powers back.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.881
I want my powers back!
I want them back now!

35:28.369 --> 35:29.927
God...

35:30.809 --> 35:34.643
I can't keep being mortal
if this is the cost.

35:34.849 --> 35:37.568
No, I don't want to lose Piper.

35:38.529 --> 35:41.441
But not at the expense
of losing one of her sisters.

35:42.809 --> 35:45.004
Now, this is my calling.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.924
You have to let me help.

35:53.849 --> 35:56.761
You have to give me my wings back.

36:11.409 --> 36:14.879
- Are you sure this is right?
- This is where Maggie pointed to.

36:16.969 --> 36:20.598
- But she's not here.
- She's gotta be here somewhere.

36:20.769 --> 36:23.044
Oh, my God. Phoebe.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.568
Prue!

36:25.689 --> 36:28.761
- Wait, we can drive there.
- No, there's no time. Come on.

36:28.969 --> 36:31.961
Prue. Get away from the railing!

36:33.409 --> 36:35.240
- Prue!
- Prue!

36:35.409 --> 36:38.719
Prue, this isn't you.
A darklighter is making you do this!

36:40.209 --> 36:42.484
- I'm all alone.
- Alone.

36:42.649 --> 36:45.004
He tried to kill Maggie,
and he's trying to kill you.

36:45.209 --> 36:47.803
He put a spell on you,
just like he did with Maggie.

36:47.969 --> 36:51.484
There is no darklighter. It's only me.

36:51.649 --> 36:53.605
- Just me.
- I have to do this.

36:53.809 --> 36:56.721
- Prue!
- Prue! You're stronger than he is.

36:56.889 --> 36:58.083
Jump, damn it.

36:59.249 --> 37:01.683
- Hurry up.
- I'm stronger.

37:01.889 --> 37:03.641
End it before I hurt them again.

37:03.849 --> 37:05.248
Prue. You have to believe us.

37:05.409 --> 37:07.798
- He's there, Prue.
- Turn around, Prue!

37:10.449 --> 37:12.440
- It's true.
- How did you...?

37:12.649 --> 37:14.844
You bastard.
How dare you hurt people this way.

37:19.689 --> 37:20.963
It's a gift.

37:21.169 --> 37:23.205
You'll jump for me, sooner or later.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.400
I haven't lost anyone yet.

37:27.409 --> 37:29.320
- You lost two today.
- Perhaps.

37:29.489 --> 37:32.799
But remember, you can't stop me.

37:39.449 --> 37:41.087
Leo?

37:41.249 --> 37:43.888
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

37:49.289 --> 37:52.406
I gotta go. Now.

38:00.809 --> 38:03.243
Well, the bridge
hasn't changed much, has it?

38:03.409 --> 38:07.766
- But you sure have.
- Well, we all have, for the better.

38:08.809 --> 38:11.642
Prue, Phoebe
and I were wondering...

38:12.049 --> 38:13.607
What?

38:13.809 --> 38:16.960
Why I was on this bridge eight years
ago? Why I took this picture?

38:17.409 --> 38:18.888
- Well, yeah.
- I don't know.

38:19.049 --> 38:23.327
I guess I was
just in a really bad place then.

38:23.489 --> 38:27.562
Anyway, I was out scouting for a shot,
and I found myself on that bridge.

38:27.769 --> 38:30.681
And I just wanted to take a picture
of it to remind myself

38:30.889 --> 38:33.084
of that particular moment
and how I was feeling.

38:33.289 --> 38:35.928
- But you weren't gonna...?
- No.

38:36.609 --> 38:38.520
No, I would never, ever do that.

38:39.289 --> 38:41.757
But why didn't you develop it?
I mean, until now?

38:41.929 --> 38:44.284
I guess I just wasn't ready
to relive that pain.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.525
But now I am.

38:46.689 --> 38:48.884
Especially since a demon
tried to take advantage of it.

38:49.369 --> 38:52.964
But that was then.

39:01.849 --> 39:03.248
And...

39:04.729 --> 39:06.242
...this.

39:06.729 --> 39:09.038
This is now.

39:09.209 --> 39:10.324
What's this?

39:10.529 --> 39:12.997
Hi, it's me. I'm a
professional photographer. Look.

39:18.809 --> 39:20.128
- I'll get it.
- Wait.

39:20.289 --> 39:22.484
What if it's Dan?
What if he's back from his trip early?

39:22.689 --> 39:24.520
Well, then I have to tell him the truth.

39:24.689 --> 39:28.318
Just because Leo has his wings back
doesn't change anything.

39:32.049 --> 39:33.607
- Honey, that's awesome.
- I know.

39:33.769 --> 39:35.566
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

39:39.849 --> 39:41.362
Leo? You rang the bell?

39:41.529 --> 39:45.522
Yeah, I wasn't sure how you'd feel
about me orbing in.

39:48.209 --> 39:49.437
I'd feel okay.

39:49.649 --> 39:53.437
But I just wanted to let you know
that this wasn't their idea.

39:54.809 --> 39:59.519
It was mine. And it's not something
that I wanted to do, it's just...

39:59.689 --> 40:01.202
Leo.

40:02.609 --> 40:08.161
I meant what I said,
and I've thought about this a lot.

40:08.329 --> 40:11.401
Whitelighter or not, we can
find a way to make this work.

40:11.889 --> 40:14.722
- Somehow, some way.
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.603
You do that.
