00:16.061 --> 00:18.061
Tell me about your morning.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.741
Start from the beginning.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.957
I woke up.

00:28.661 --> 00:29.918
How did you sleep?

00:31.819 --> 00:33.619
I didn't. I don't.

00:34.621 --> 00:36.181
You just said you woke up.

00:37.581 --> 00:39.061
I stopped lying down.

00:41.101 --> 00:42.461
Alone?

00:47.461 --> 00:49.340
Of course alone.

00:49.341 --> 00:53.180
I meant Rosie. Your daughter.

00:53.181 --> 00:55.519
- Er, she's with friends.
- Why?

00:57.141 --> 00:58.501
Can't always cope.

01:00.141 --> 01:03.722
And, er, last night wasn't good.

01:05.701 --> 01:07.180
That's understandable.

01:07.181 --> 01:10.700
Is it? Why? Why is it understandable?

01:10.701 --> 01:13.220
Why does everything have
to be understandable?

01:13.221 --> 01:17.461
Why can't some things be
unacceptable and we just say that?

01:19.369 --> 01:21.728
I only mean it's OK.

01:21.729 --> 01:25.088
I'm letting my daughter down,
how the hell is that OK?

01:25.089 --> 01:26.768
You just lost your wife.

01:26.769 --> 01:28.569
And Rosie just lost her mother.

01:33.649 --> 01:38.048
You are holding yourself to
an unreasonable standard.

01:38.049 --> 01:40.458
No, I'm failing to.

01:41.889 --> 01:46.008
So there is no-one
you talk to? Confide in?

01:46.009 --> 01:48.008
No-one.

01:48.009 --> 01:50.808
Oh, I'm picking up Rosie this afternoon,

01:50.809 --> 01:52.248
after I've seen my therapist.

01:52.249 --> 01:55.408
Got a new one, seeing her today.

01:55.409 --> 01:57.408
Are you going to tell her about me?

01:57.409 --> 01:58.449
No.

01:59.969 --> 02:01.328
Why not?

02:01.329 --> 02:03.288
- Because I can't.
- Why not?

02:03.289 --> 02:05.808
Because I can't. You know I can't.
She thinks you're dead.

02:05.809 --> 02:08.489
John, you've got to remember,
it's important.

02:09.489 --> 02:10.809
I am dead.

02:12.209 --> 02:17.288
Please, for your own sake
and for Rosie's, this isn't real.

02:17.289 --> 02:20.928
- I'm dead. John, look at me.
- Hmm.

02:20.929 --> 02:22.528
I'm not here.

02:22.529 --> 02:25.569
You know that, don't you?

02:27.249 --> 02:28.569
OK, I'll see you later.

02:30.849 --> 02:33.329
Is there anything you're not telling me?

02:36.209 --> 02:37.809
No.

02:40.609 --> 02:42.488
What are you looking at?

02:42.489 --> 02:44.048
Nothing.

02:44.049 --> 02:47.088
You keep glancing to my left.

02:47.089 --> 02:50.368
Oh, I suppose I was just looking away.

02:50.369 --> 02:54.928
There is a difference between
looking away and looking to.

02:54.929 --> 02:58.048
- I tend to notice these things.
- I'm sure.

02:58.049 --> 03:02.368
Now, I am reminding you
of your friend, I think.

03:02.369 --> 03:04.329
That's not necessarily a good thing.

03:05.369 --> 03:07.689
Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?

03:07.714 --> 03:10.087
I haven't seen him. No-one's seen him.

03:10.088 --> 03:12.168
He's locked himself away in his flat.
God knows what he's up to.

03:12.169 --> 03:13.968
Do you blame him?

03:13.969 --> 03:16.048
I don't blame... I don't think about him.

03:16.049 --> 03:18.389
Has he attempted to
make contact with you?

03:18.414 --> 03:19.168
No.

03:19.169 --> 03:21.528
How can you be sure? He might have tried.

03:21.529 --> 03:23.368
No, if Sherlock Holmes
wants to get in touch,

03:23.369 --> 03:25.248
that's not something
you can fail to notice.

03:46.409 --> 03:50.263
Well, now, won't you introduce me?

03:53.907 --> 04:00.897

04:39.649 --> 04:42.369
Mr Smith, will you
say something about your property...

04:46.489 --> 04:47.769
Hello.

04:50.129 --> 04:53.929
Mr Smith? Whenever you are ready.

04:54.769 --> 04:56.288
The charity fund...

04:56.289 --> 04:57.848
Now, please.

04:57.849 --> 04:59.609
Bring them through.

05:01.326 --> 05:04.802
_

05:07.569 --> 05:12.168
It's difficult, having such good friends.

05:12.169 --> 05:15.489
Friends are people you want to share with.

05:16.849 --> 05:20.049
Friends and family.

05:22.929 --> 05:28.883
What's the very worst thing you
can do to your very best friends?

05:31.449 --> 05:32.889
Something on your mind?

05:34.529 --> 05:36.168
Yes, Ivan.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.594
Oh, yes.

05:39.449 --> 05:41.928
Whatever you tell us stays in this room.

05:41.929 --> 05:43.336
I think I speak for everyone.

05:46.525 --> 05:49.165
Well, what is the
worst thing you could do?

05:51.089 --> 05:53.289
Tell them your darkest secret.

05:54.649 --> 06:01.248
Because if you tell them and they
decide they'd rather not know,

06:01.249 --> 06:03.368
you can't take it back.

06:03.369 --> 06:06.102
You can't unsay it.

06:07.995 --> 06:12.475
Once you've opened your heart,
you can't close it again.

06:19.369 --> 06:20.969
I'm kidding!

06:22.729 --> 06:24.329
Of course you can.

06:26.369 --> 06:29.928
Well, everyone,
please roll up your right sleeves.

06:29.929 --> 06:33.088
Roll up your right sleeves. Come on.

06:33.089 --> 06:34.888
Oh, it's, er...

06:34.889 --> 06:36.968
It's a bit of insurance.

06:36.969 --> 06:38.929
I don't understand. What is that?

06:40.316 --> 06:41.556
TD 12.

06:42.729 --> 06:43.928
One of ours.

06:43.929 --> 06:44.968
One of yours?

06:44.969 --> 06:47.808
We make it. My company, TD 12.

06:47.809 --> 06:50.688
Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals,

06:50.689 --> 06:52.649
for minor surgical procedures.

06:54.033 --> 06:55.193
Interferes with...

06:56.129 --> 06:57.568
...with the memory.

06:57.569 --> 06:59.609
The memory. Yes.

07:01.049 --> 07:05.328
I want to thank you, Ivan,
for allowing me to use it.

07:05.329 --> 07:08.808
I didn't exactly know who you
were going to be using it on.

07:08.809 --> 07:10.968
You mean you didn't ask?

07:10.969 --> 07:12.568
Is everyone ready?

07:12.569 --> 07:15.394
- No.
- Please, roll up your sleeves.

07:15.419 --> 07:16.913
Come on, roll up.

07:22.849 --> 07:25.008
This is obscene.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.087
All I'm doing, Faith, dear...

07:28.331 --> 07:33.411
...is getting something off my chest,
without getting it on yours.

07:34.409 --> 07:37.767
What you're about to hear me
say may horrify you, but...

07:38.809 --> 07:40.128
...you will forget it.

07:40.129 --> 07:41.408
If you think about it,

07:41.409 --> 07:47.122
civilisation has always depended
on a measure of elective ignorance.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.928
These drip feeds will keep
the drug in your bloodstreams

07:56.929 --> 07:58.648
at exactly the right levels.

07:58.649 --> 08:01.448
Nothing that is happening to
you now will stay with you

08:01.449 --> 08:04.128
for more than a few minutes.

08:04.129 --> 08:08.928
I'm afraid that some of the
memories you've had up to this point

08:08.929 --> 08:11.127
might also be...

08:13.889 --> 08:15.329
...corrupted.

08:16.609 --> 08:19.128
I'm going to share
something with you now,

08:19.129 --> 08:24.529
something personal and
of importance to me.

08:25.729 --> 08:32.009
I have a need to confess, but you,
I think, might have a need to forget.

08:33.289 --> 08:36.768
By the end of this, you'll be
free to go, and don't worry,

08:36.769 --> 08:39.967
by the time you're back
in the outside world,

08:39.969 --> 08:43.648
you will not remember
any of what you've heard.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.048
Ignorance is bliss.

08:45.049 --> 08:46.928
Well, what's wrong with bliss?

08:48.169 --> 08:51.209
Some of you know each other
and some of you don't.

08:53.529 --> 08:58.969
Please, be aware that one of you
is a high-ranking police officer.

09:01.199 --> 09:03.439
One of you is a member of the judiciary.

09:06.642 --> 09:12.494
One of you sits on the board
of a prominent broadcaster.

09:13.129 --> 09:14.848
Two of you work for me.

09:14.849 --> 09:19.209
And one of you, of course,
is my lovely daughter, Faith.

09:21.649 --> 09:24.689
You are the people I need to hear me.

09:25.729 --> 09:28.128
I have made millions.

09:28.129 --> 09:31.648
For myself, for the
people round this table,

09:31.649 --> 09:33.968
for millions of people
I've never even met.

09:35.329 --> 09:39.409
There are charities that I support
who wouldn't exist without me.

09:41.089 --> 09:44.008
If life is a balance sheet,
and I think it is,

09:44.009 --> 09:46.798
why, I believe I'm in credit!

09:50.769 --> 09:56.135
But I have a situation
that needs to be... managed.

09:57.804 --> 10:02.404
I have a problem and there is
only one way that I can solve it.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.545
And what's that?

10:10.929 --> 10:12.169
I'm terribly sorry.

10:18.929 --> 10:20.732
I need to kill someone.

10:21.050 --> 10:22.740
_

10:24.318 --> 10:25.398
Who?

10:33.329 --> 10:36.449
Were we in a meeting? Was there a meeting?

10:41.169 --> 10:42.768
Need to kill someone.

10:42.769 --> 10:43.849
Faith...

10:46.209 --> 10:48.925
- My dear, dear girl.
- I can't remember.

10:49.527 --> 10:51.367
Can't remember who
you were going to kill.

10:52.569 --> 10:58.355
Dear, in five minutes, you won't
even remember why you were crying.

10:59.929 --> 11:01.208
The others are all fine.

11:01.209 --> 11:03.528
You know they've gone down the pub.

11:03.529 --> 11:05.009
It's all on me!

11:09.449 --> 11:12.568
Oh, Faith, don't you
think I should take that?

11:12.569 --> 11:15.449
It's only going to upset you. Hmm?

11:19.609 --> 11:23.209
Three years ago, my father
told me he wanted to kill someone.

11:23.929 --> 11:27.689
One word, Mr Holmes,
and it changed my world forever.

11:29.141 --> 11:30.300
Just one word.

11:30.301 --> 11:31.941
What word?

11:32.937 --> 11:34.537
A name.

11:34.562 --> 11:36.202
What name?

11:39.461 --> 11:41.061
I can't remember.

11:42.141 --> 11:44.341
I can't remember who my
father wanted to kill.

11:45.947 --> 11:49.602
- And I don't know if he ever did it.
- Well, you've changed,

11:49.627 --> 11:51.740
you no longer top up your tan
and your roots are showing.

11:51.741 --> 11:53.220
Letting yourself go?

11:53.221 --> 11:56.260
Do you ever look in the mirror
and want to see someone else?

11:56.261 --> 11:58.780
- No, do you own an American car?
- I'm sorry?

11:58.781 --> 12:00.940
No, not American, left-hand drive,
that's what I mean.

12:00.941 --> 12:02.621
No. Why do you ask?

12:03.781 --> 12:06.421
Not sure, actually,
probably just noticed something.

12:06.754 --> 12:08.522
_

12:14.821 --> 12:16.380
Are you OK?

12:16.381 --> 12:18.900
Oh, of course you don't own a car,
you don't need one, do you,

12:18.901 --> 12:21.220
living in isolation,
no human contact, no visitors.

12:21.221 --> 12:23.940
- OK, how do you know that?
- Well, it's all here, isn't it? Look.

12:23.941 --> 12:25.700
Cost-cutting is clearly
a priority for you,

12:25.701 --> 12:27.460
look at the size of your
kitchen, teeny tiny.

12:27.461 --> 12:29.460
Must be a bit annoying when
you're such a keen cook.

12:29.461 --> 12:31.060
- I don't understand...
- Hang on a minute,

12:31.061 --> 12:33.100
I was looking out of the window,
why was I doing that?

12:33.101 --> 12:35.020
- I don't know.
- Me neither. Must have had a reason.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.604
It'll come back to me.

12:37.421 --> 12:40.220
Presumably you downsized when you...
when you left your job

12:40.221 --> 12:42.901
and maybe when you
ended your relationship.

12:43.821 --> 12:45.980
- You can't know that.
- Course I can.

12:45.981 --> 12:48.540
There wasn't anything physical
going on, was there?

12:48.541 --> 12:51.220
For quite some time, in fact.

12:51.221 --> 12:52.460
There, see? It's obvious.

12:52.461 --> 12:54.740
You can't tell things like
that from a piece of paper.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.300
I think I just did, didn't I?

12:56.301 --> 12:57.620
I'm sure that was me.

12:57.621 --> 12:58.780
How?

12:58.781 --> 13:01.140
Don't know. Just sort of happens really.

13:01.141 --> 13:04.381
It's like a reflex, I can't stop it.

13:07.761 --> 13:09.086
_

13:13.501 --> 13:15.460
Coat.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.940
I don't have a coat.

13:16.941 --> 13:19.180
Yes, what I just noticed. I wonder why.

13:19.181 --> 13:21.700
Who are you talking to?

13:21.701 --> 13:22.941
Piss off!

13:24.141 --> 13:25.500
So what do you think?

13:25.501 --> 13:27.260
- Of what?
- My case.

13:27.261 --> 13:29.700
Oh, it's way too weird for me.
Go to the police,

13:29.701 --> 13:32.940
they're really excellent at dealing
with this complicated sort of stuff.

13:32.941 --> 13:35.620
Tell them I sent you, that ought
to get a reaction. Night-night.

13:52.389 --> 13:55.700
Please... I have no-one else to turn to.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.660
Yes, well, I'm very busy at the moment,

13:57.661 --> 13:59.428
I have to drink a cup of tea.

14:02.221 --> 14:05.100
Is "cup of tea"...code?

14:05.101 --> 14:06.180
It's a cup of tea.

14:06.181 --> 14:09.781
Because you might prefer some "coffee".

14:11.901 --> 14:14.060
You're my last hope.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.341
Really? That's bad luck, isn't it?
Goodnight, go away.

14:17.741 --> 14:19.100
What's bad luck?

14:19.101 --> 14:22.340
Stop talking, it makes me
aware of your existence.

14:22.341 --> 14:25.260
I've always had bad luck.
It's congenital.

14:25.261 --> 14:26.380
Handbag!

14:26.381 --> 14:28.860
That's not rude. Congenital.
It just means...

14:28.861 --> 14:30.181
Handbag!

14:31.181 --> 14:34.460
Stop! Wait! Your life is not your own!

14:34.461 --> 14:35.940
Keep your hands off it, do you hear me?

14:35.941 --> 14:38.660
Off it. Off it.

14:38.661 --> 14:42.340
Sorry? What? What are you talking about?

14:42.341 --> 14:44.420
- Your skirt.
- My skirt?

14:44.421 --> 14:46.140
Look at the hem of it,
that's what I noticed.

14:46.141 --> 14:49.180
Sorry, I'm still catching up with
my brain. It's terribly fast.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.140
Those markings, you see them?

14:51.141 --> 14:53.660
You only get marks like that by
trapping the hem of your skirt

14:53.661 --> 14:55.660
in a car door, but they're
on the left-hand side,

14:55.661 --> 14:57.980
so you weren't driving,
you were in the passenger seat.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.180
I came in a taxi.

14:59.181 --> 15:01.060
There is no taxi waiting
in the street outside,

15:01.061 --> 15:03.180
that's what I checked
when I went to the window.

15:03.181 --> 15:04.700
And you've got all the way to the door

15:04.701 --> 15:06.300
and not made any move to phone for one.

15:06.301 --> 15:07.420
And look at you.

15:07.421 --> 15:09.380
You didn't even bring
a coat, in this rain?

15:09.381 --> 15:11.620
Now, all that might mean nothing,

15:11.621 --> 15:15.140
except with the angle of the
scars on your left forearm,

15:15.141 --> 15:17.220
you know, under that sleeve
you keep pulling down.

15:17.221 --> 15:18.980
You never saw them.

15:18.981 --> 15:21.620
No, I didn't, so thank you
for confirming my hypothesis.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.835
I don't really need to check

15:22.860 --> 15:24.265
that the angle is consistent

15:24.290 --> 15:25.860
- with self-harm, do I?
- No.

15:25.861 --> 15:27.940
Then you can keep your scars.

15:27.941 --> 15:29.660
I want to see your handbag.

15:29.661 --> 15:31.380
Why?

15:31.381 --> 15:33.060
It's too heavy.

15:33.061 --> 15:35.740
You said I was your last hope and
now you are going out into the night

15:35.741 --> 15:37.623
with no plan on how
you're getting home...

15:38.981 --> 15:40.181
...and a gun.

15:46.701 --> 15:48.741
- Chips.
- Chips?

15:48.766 --> 15:51.036
You're suicidal, you're allowed chips.

15:51.061 --> 15:53.061
Trust me, it's about the only perk.

15:58.981 --> 16:01.820
Sherlock? Are you going out?

16:01.821 --> 16:05.020
I think I remember the way,
it's through there, isn't it?

16:05.021 --> 16:07.340
But you're in no state, look at you!

16:07.341 --> 16:09.220
Yeah, well, I've got
a friend with me, so...

16:09.221 --> 16:10.860
What friend?

16:10.861 --> 16:11.901
Bye.

16:13.941 --> 16:14.981
Oh!

16:18.661 --> 16:19.940
Come on.

16:19.941 --> 16:24.503
I'm Culverton Smith, and this
election year, I'll be voting...

16:25.221 --> 16:28.140
For God's sake!
I was talking to the Prime Minister.

16:28.141 --> 16:32.580
I'm sorry, Mr Holmes, it's your
brother. He's left his flat.

16:32.581 --> 16:35.300
Was it on fire?

16:36.381 --> 16:40.261
'Even when I'm on the road,
I still like quality food.'

16:44.141 --> 16:46.100
You see the fold in the middle?

16:46.101 --> 16:49.660
For the first few months you kept
this hidden, folded inside a book.

16:49.661 --> 16:51.660
It must have been a tightly packed shelf,

16:51.661 --> 16:53.500
going by the severity of the crease.

16:53.501 --> 16:55.620
So obviously you were keeping it hidden

16:55.621 --> 16:58.020
from someone living in the same
house at a level of intimacy

16:58.021 --> 17:01.420
where privacy could not be assumed.
Conclusion, relationship.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.060
Not any more, though.

17:03.061 --> 17:05.140
There's a pinprick at
the top of the paper.

17:05.141 --> 17:08.020
For the past few months it's
been on open display on a wall.

17:08.021 --> 17:10.140
Conclusion? Relationship is over.

17:10.141 --> 17:12.940
The paper's been exposed to steam
in a variety of cooking smells,

17:12.941 --> 17:14.861
so it must have been on
display in the kitchen.

17:16.901 --> 17:19.420
A lot of different spices,
you're suicidal,

17:19.421 --> 17:23.660
alone and strapped for cash,
yet you're still cooking to impress.

17:23.661 --> 17:25.339
You're keen, then.

17:25.340 --> 17:28.580
The kitchen is the most
public room in any house.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.220
And since any visitor could
be expected to ask about

17:31.221 --> 17:34.181
a note like this, I have to
assume you don't have any.

17:35.181 --> 17:36.781
You've isolated yourself.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.333
Amazing.

17:39.358 --> 17:40.398
I know.

17:42.007 --> 17:43.287
I meant the chips.

17:48.221 --> 17:50.420
Hmm.

17:55.581 --> 17:57.581
Let's go for a walk.

18:05.861 --> 18:08.529
- You should answer it.
- It's Mycroft.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.381
Might be about Sherlock.

18:10.406 --> 18:12.980
Of course it's about Sherlock.
Everything's about Sherlock.

18:12.981 --> 18:14.580
'How did you know my kitchen was tiny?'

18:14.581 --> 18:17.100
Well, look, the fading pattern
on the paper, it's not much,

18:17.101 --> 18:19.380
but it's enough to know your
kitchen window faces east.

18:19.381 --> 18:21.701
Now, kitchen noticeboards.

18:23.061 --> 18:27.780
By instinct, you place them at eye level,
where there's natural light.

18:27.781 --> 18:31.620
Now look, the sun's only
struck the bottom two thirds,

18:31.621 --> 18:33.220
but the line is straight,

18:33.221 --> 18:36.861
so that means we know the
paper is facing the window.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.900
But, because the top
section is unaffected,

18:42.901 --> 18:46.900
we know the sunlight can only be
entering the room at a steep angle.

18:46.901 --> 18:50.420
If the sunlight was able
to penetrate the room

18:50.421 --> 18:52.140
when the sun was lower in the sky,

18:52.141 --> 18:56.060
then the paper would be equally
faded, top to bottom.

18:56.061 --> 18:58.420
But no. It only makes it
when the sun is at its zenith,

18:58.421 --> 19:03.781
so I'm betting that you live in a
narrow street on the ground floor.

19:05.901 --> 19:09.340
Now, if steeply angled sunlight
manages to hit eye level

19:09.341 --> 19:12.301
on the wall opposite the window,
then what do we know about the room?

19:19.181 --> 19:20.220
The room's small.

19:22.141 --> 19:24.352
Oh, Big Brother is watching you!

19:24.377 --> 19:25.417
Literally.

19:25.981 --> 19:29.300
We can keep tabs.
You didn't have to come in.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.860
I was talking to the Prime Minister.

19:31.861 --> 19:33.780
Oh, I see.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.700
What's he doing?

19:35.701 --> 19:38.060
Why is he just wandering
about like a fool?

19:38.061 --> 19:41.620
She died, Mycroft.
He's probably still in shock.

19:41.621 --> 19:43.220
Everybody dies.

19:43.221 --> 19:46.300
It's the one thing human beings
can be relied upon to do.

19:46.301 --> 19:48.500
How can it still come
as a surprise to people?

19:48.501 --> 19:50.701
You sound cross.

19:50.833 --> 19:53.832
Am I going to be taken
away by security again?

19:53.833 --> 19:56.912
I have, I think, apologised extensively.

19:56.913 --> 19:58.512
You haven't made it up to me.

19:58.513 --> 20:00.192
And how am I supposed to do that?

20:00.193 --> 20:01.712
- Sex.
- I'm sorry?

20:01.713 --> 20:07.552
Sex. How did you
know I wasn't getting any?

20:07.553 --> 20:08.632
It's all about the blood.

20:08.633 --> 20:10.432
This one comes from the very first night.

20:10.433 --> 20:12.232
You can see the pen marks over it.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.872
I think you discovered that
pain stimulated your memory,

20:14.873 --> 20:16.552
so you tried it again later.

20:16.553 --> 20:19.832
I'm no expert, but I assume that
since your lover failed to notice

20:19.833 --> 20:22.312
an increasing number of scars
over a period of months,

20:22.313 --> 20:24.872
that the relationship
was no longer intimate.

20:24.873 --> 20:26.472
How do you know he didn't notice?

20:26.473 --> 20:29.592
Oh, well, cos he would have done
something about it. Would he?

20:29.593 --> 20:31.832
- Wouldn't he?
- Isn't that what you people do?

20:31.833 --> 20:34.032
- Well, that's interesting.
- What is?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.356
The way you think.

20:35.381 --> 20:36.752
- Superbly?
- Sweetly.

20:36.753 --> 20:39.912
I'm not sweet, I'm just high. This way.

20:39.913 --> 20:42.912
- Well, we just came that way.
- I know, it's a plan.

20:42.913 --> 20:45.072
What plan?

20:45.073 --> 20:46.832
What is it? What... What now?

20:46.833 --> 20:49.473
Sorry, um, traced his route on the map.

20:51.425 --> 20:53.417
_

20:56.393 --> 20:57.712
Is he with someone?

20:57.713 --> 20:59.952
Not sure. We keep losing visual.

20:59.953 --> 21:01.912
Mostly we're tracking his phone.

21:01.913 --> 21:04.832
Don't call us, we'll call...

21:04.833 --> 21:07.152
I'm trying to sleep, can you
stop ringing my damn phone?

21:07.153 --> 21:09.872
'Sherlock has left his flat,
first time in a week.'

21:09.873 --> 21:11.592
- So I'm having him tracked.
- 'Nice.'

21:11.593 --> 21:14.152
It's very touching how you
can hijack the machinery

21:14.153 --> 21:16.192
of the state to look
after your own family.

21:16.193 --> 21:17.792
Can I go to sleep now?

21:17.793 --> 21:20.032
Sherlock gone rogue is a
legitimate security concern.

21:20.033 --> 21:22.952
The fact that I'm his brother
changes absolutely nothing.

21:22.953 --> 21:25.873
It didn't the last time,
and I assure you, it won't with...

21:29.239 --> 21:30.479
...with Sherlock.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.152
Sorry, what?

21:33.153 --> 21:35.553
'Please phone me if he gets
in contact, thank you.'

21:38.153 --> 21:40.552
Do you still speak to Sherrinford?

21:40.553 --> 21:43.072
I get regular updates.

21:43.073 --> 21:44.312
And?

21:44.313 --> 21:46.952
Sherrinford is secure.

21:46.953 --> 21:48.512
Are we going to walk all night?

21:48.513 --> 21:51.672
Possibly. It's a long word.

21:51.673 --> 21:53.192
What is?

21:53.193 --> 21:54.673
"Bollocks".

21:58.153 --> 22:00.832
Culverton Smith, all this charity work,

22:00.833 --> 22:03.072
what's in it for you?

22:03.073 --> 22:06.771
We must be careful not
to burn our bridges.

22:07.913 --> 22:10.952
Do you know why
I'm going to take your case?

22:10.953 --> 22:13.232
Because of the one
impossible thing you said.

22:13.233 --> 22:15.032
What impossible thing?

22:15.033 --> 22:17.352
You said your life turned on one word.

22:17.353 --> 22:21.472
Yes. The name of the person
my father wanted to kill.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.632
That's the impossible thing.
Just that, right there.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.032
What's impossible?

22:25.033 --> 22:27.792
Names are not one word.
They're always at least two.

22:27.793 --> 22:31.552
Sherlock Holmes. Faith Smith.
Santa Claus. Winston Churchill.

22:31.553 --> 22:35.152
Napoleon Bonaparte...
Actually, just Napoleon would do.

22:35.153 --> 22:36.232
Or Elvis.

22:36.233 --> 22:38.952
Well, I think we can rule
both of them out as targets.

22:38.953 --> 22:40.552
OK, I got it wrong, then.

22:40.553 --> 22:42.592
It wasn't on one word,
it can't have been.

22:42.593 --> 22:44.352
And you remember quite distinctly

22:44.353 --> 22:46.432
that your whole life turned on one word.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.472
So that happened, I don't doubt it,
but how can that word be a name?

22:49.473 --> 22:52.872
A name you instantly recognised
that tore your world apart?

22:52.873 --> 22:55.513
- OK, well, how?
- No idea... yet.

22:56.993 --> 22:58.873
But I don't work for free.

23:01.641 --> 23:04.535
- You take cash?
- Not cash, no.

23:22.753 --> 23:27.952
Taking your own life. Interesting
expression, taking it from who?

23:27.953 --> 23:32.792
Once it's over, it's
not you who'll miss it.

23:36.206 --> 23:39.992
Your own death is something
that happens to everybody else.

23:39.993 --> 23:43.393
Your life is not your own.
Keep your hands off it.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.673
You're not what I expected, you...

23:52.953 --> 23:55.592
- What? What am I?
- Nicer.

23:55.593 --> 23:58.312
Than who?

23:58.313 --> 24:00.353
Anyone.

24:09.593 --> 24:10.633
Sorry, I...

24:13.233 --> 24:14.273
Faith?

24:15.408 --> 24:16.753
Faith?

24:27.913 --> 24:30.312
'You said your
life turned on one word.

24:30.313 --> 24:32.272
A name can't be one word.

24:32.273 --> 24:34.752
If you were to come
round asking after him

24:34.753 --> 24:38.192
'that he'd rather have anyone
but you. Anyone.

24:38.193 --> 24:40.552
You're not what I expected.

24:40.553 --> 24:43.672
- What? What am I?
- Nicer.

24:43.673 --> 24:45.672
- Than who?
- Anyone.

24:45.673 --> 24:47.992
Don't think anyone else
is going to save him,

24:47.993 --> 24:49.512
because there isn't anyone.'

24:49.513 --> 24:52.073
- Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.
- Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.'

24:54.353 --> 24:57.797
I have a situation that
needs to be managed.

25:02.033 --> 25:04.992
There's only one way that I can solve it.

25:04.993 --> 25:07.233
And what's that?

25:10.433 --> 25:15.393
I need to kill someone. Who? Who?

25:17.435 --> 25:18.635
Anyone!

25:20.833 --> 25:25.552
Of course! He doesn't want to kill
one person, he wants to kill anyone.

25:25.553 --> 25:28.512
He's a serial killer.

25:28.513 --> 25:29.752
Anyone.

25:29.753 --> 25:32.392
- He could be!
- Anyone!

25:32.393 --> 25:35.713
Why not? Why shouldn't he be?

25:39.490 --> 25:41.152
Oi, you!

25:41.153 --> 25:43.832
What's the matter with you?!

25:43.833 --> 25:45.712
'Anyone!'

25:45.713 --> 25:48.472
Do you know where you are? Are you drunk?

25:48.473 --> 25:49.513
Shezzer.

25:50.052 --> 25:51.411
What are you doing here?

25:51.436 --> 25:54.112
What were you doing in the
middle of a bloody street?

25:54.113 --> 25:55.552
You should be at Baker Street.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.433
I am. So are you.

26:01.030 --> 26:04.192
They found your address,
they brought you here.

26:04.193 --> 26:08.553
You've had too much.
And that's me saying that!

26:10.233 --> 26:12.033
Kill.

26:14.797 --> 26:16.237
Kill.

26:23.233 --> 26:25.032
- Anyone.
- Anyone.

26:25.033 --> 26:28.888
They're always poor
and lonely and strange.

26:29.873 --> 26:32.072
But those are only the ones we catch.

26:32.073 --> 26:33.162
Who do we catch?

26:33.187 --> 26:34.227
Serial killers.

26:36.433 --> 26:38.112
What if you were rich and...

26:38.113 --> 26:40.072
powerful and necessary?

26:40.073 --> 26:41.673
Anyone.

26:42.873 --> 26:47.273
What if you had the compulsion
to kill and money? What then?!

27:34.713 --> 27:38.633
Well, now, won't you introduce me?

27:45.193 --> 27:48.192
Right, you there!
Stop right where you are!

27:48.193 --> 27:50.432
- What? Oh, John...
- Mrs Hudson...

27:50.433 --> 27:52.752
Do you have any idea what
speed you were going at?

27:52.753 --> 27:54.872
No, of course not! I was on the phone.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.832
- Oh, it's for you, by the way.
- For me?

27:56.833 --> 27:58.872
- It's the Government.
- The what?

27:58.873 --> 28:00.712
- What's going on? What's wrong?
- Hello?

28:00.713 --> 28:03.072
- Look at the state of you...
- 'My name is Mycroft Holmes.

28:03.073 --> 28:05.112
I am speaking to you
from the Cabinet Office.'

28:05.113 --> 28:07.872
- What's happened?
- It's Sherlock!

28:07.873 --> 28:10.272
You've no idea what I've been through!

28:10.273 --> 28:14.032
Argh! Right! Argh!

28:14.033 --> 28:16.352
Away!

28:16.353 --> 28:19.152
- I'm out of here! He's lost it.
- Where is it?!

28:19.153 --> 28:21.432
- He's totally gone!
- Aah!

28:21.433 --> 28:25.001
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends! Once more!

28:26.033 --> 28:28.752
Or close the wall up
with our English dead!

28:28.753 --> 28:31.632
Set the teeth and
stretch the nostril wide!

28:31.633 --> 28:36.472
Hold hard the breath and build up
every spirit to his full height! On!

28:36.473 --> 28:38.072
On, you noblest English

28:38.073 --> 28:40.832
whose blood is fet from
fathers of war-proof!

28:40.833 --> 28:42.032
And you, good yeoman,

28:42.033 --> 28:43.792
Whose limbs were made in England,

28:43.793 --> 28:45.152
show us here

28:45.153 --> 28:46.352
the mettle of your pasture.

28:46.353 --> 28:47.512
Which I doubt not

28:47.513 --> 28:49.792
for there is none of you
here so mean and base

28:49.793 --> 28:52.112
that hath not noble lustre in your eyes!

28:52.113 --> 28:55.352
I see you standing like
greyhounds in the slips,

28:55.353 --> 28:56.873
straining upon the start!

29:02.273 --> 29:03.473
The game's afoot.

29:06.233 --> 29:08.312
Oh, hello.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.626
Can I have a cup of tea?

29:10.651 --> 29:12.448
Did you call the police?

29:12.473 --> 29:15.512
Of course I didn't call the police,
I'm not a civilian!

29:15.513 --> 29:20.232
These pictures, they're that
man on the telly, aren't they?

29:20.233 --> 29:22.432
- What pictures?
- They're everywhere.

29:22.433 --> 29:25.546
Oh, these pictures?! Oh, you
can see them too? That's good.

29:33.233 --> 29:36.672
Culverton Smith. This, I think,
is relevant, from this morning.

29:36.673 --> 29:40.552
He's publicly accused Mr Smith
of being a serial killer.

29:40.553 --> 29:43.792
Christ! Sherlock on Twitter,
he really has lost it.

29:43.793 --> 29:46.192
Don't you dare make
jokes! Don't you dare!

29:46.193 --> 29:47.432
I was terrified!

29:47.433 --> 29:50.392
Cup of tea! Oh, for goodness' sakes!

29:50.393 --> 29:51.752
What's the matter with you?!

29:51.753 --> 29:54.153
Are you having an earthquake?!

30:00.313 --> 30:02.005
You need to see him, John,

30:02.030 --> 30:03.417
you need to help him!

30:03.442 --> 30:04.672
- No.
- He needs you!

30:04.673 --> 30:07.752
Somebody else! Not me, not now.

30:07.753 --> 30:10.072
Now, you just listen to me,
for once in your stupid life!

30:10.073 --> 30:12.952
I know Mary's dead and I
know your heart is broken,

30:12.953 --> 30:15.861
but if Sherlock Holmes dies too,
who will you have then?

30:15.886 --> 30:19.861
Because I'll tell you something,
John Watson, you will not have me!

30:38.141 --> 30:41.180
Have you spoken to Mycroft?
Molly? Anyone?

30:41.181 --> 30:46.780
They don't matter, you do. Would
you just see him? Please, John.

30:46.781 --> 30:49.260
Or just take a look at him as a doctor.

30:49.261 --> 30:52.020
I know you'd change your mind if you did.

30:52.021 --> 30:54.460
Yeah, look, OK, maybe, if I get a chance.

30:54.461 --> 30:55.980
Do you promise?

30:55.981 --> 30:57.892
I'll try, if I'm in the area.

30:57.917 --> 30:59.516
Promise me?

30:59.541 --> 31:01.341
- I promise.
- Thank you.

31:09.701 --> 31:14.061
Well, on you go. Examine him.

31:40.861 --> 31:44.740
Right then, mister!
Now, I need your handcuffs.

31:44.741 --> 31:47.860
I happen to know there's a
pair in the salad drawer.

31:47.861 --> 31:49.740
I've borrowed them before.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.941
Oh, get over yourself! You're not
my first smackhead, Sherlock Holmes!

31:55.741 --> 31:58.700
Woman's out of control!
I asked for a cup of tea!

31:58.701 --> 32:01.060
- How did you get him in the boot?
- The boys from the cafe.

32:01.061 --> 32:02.260
They dropped me! Twice!

32:02.261 --> 32:04.260
And do you know why
they dropped you, dear?

32:04.261 --> 32:05.501
Because they know you.

32:06.661 --> 32:08.860
Who's this one? Is this a new person?

32:08.861 --> 32:11.380
- I'm against new people.
- Excuse me for a moment.

32:11.381 --> 32:13.380
She's my therapist.

32:13.381 --> 32:15.340
Awesome! Do you do block bookings?

32:15.341 --> 32:17.220
- Whose car is that?
- That's my car.

32:17.221 --> 32:18.620
How can that be your car?!

32:18.621 --> 32:20.060
Oh, for God's sake!

32:20.061 --> 32:22.900
I'm the widow of a drug dealer,
I own property in central London,

32:22.901 --> 32:27.100
and for the last bloody time,
John, I'm not your housekeeper!

32:27.101 --> 32:30.300
I'm so sorry, I answered your
phone, you were busy.

32:30.301 --> 32:31.660
I think you'll want to take it.

32:31.661 --> 32:33.100
Yes, hello?

32:33.101 --> 32:34.660
Is this Dr John Watson?

32:34.661 --> 32:35.701
Yeah, who's this?

32:37.821 --> 32:40.660
Culverton Smith.
You've probably heard of me.

32:40.661 --> 32:42.020
Um, well, yes.

32:42.021 --> 32:44.780
Get me a fresh glass of water,
please, this one's filthy.

32:44.781 --> 32:48.141
'I mean, I'm aware of
this morning's developments.'

32:49.421 --> 32:51.940
Yes, I'm sure he was being hilarious.

32:51.941 --> 32:53.900
Sorry, did you say "all still meeting"?

32:53.901 --> 32:55.700
'You, me and Mr Holmes.'

32:55.701 --> 32:57.660
I've sent a car, should be outside.

32:57.661 --> 32:59.460
Mr Holmes gave me an address.

32:59.461 --> 33:01.303
Well, he couldn't have
given you this one...

33:05.981 --> 33:07.181
When you're ready.

33:12.376 --> 33:14.554
When did Sherlock give
you this address?

33:14.579 --> 33:16.420
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks?

33:16.421 --> 33:18.940
'Yes, two weeks.'

33:20.381 --> 33:22.180
How did you know where to find me?

33:22.181 --> 33:23.780
Oh, Sherlock told me.

33:23.781 --> 33:26.581
He's not so difficult when
you've got a gun on him.

33:29.461 --> 33:33.580
How did you know?! How? On Monday,
I decided to get a new therapist.

33:33.581 --> 33:35.260
Tuesday afternoon, I chose her.

33:35.261 --> 33:37.820
Wednesday morning, I
booked today's session.

33:37.821 --> 33:40.020
Now, today is Friday. So two weeks ago,

33:40.021 --> 33:42.380
two weeks before you
were abducted at gunpoint

33:42.381 --> 33:43.900
and brought here against your will,

33:43.901 --> 33:46.140
over a week before I even
thought of coming here,

33:46.141 --> 33:48.981
you knew exactly where you'd
need to be picked up for lunch?!

33:50.461 --> 33:52.860
Really? I correctly anticipated

33:52.861 --> 33:55.220
the responses of people I know
well to scenarios I devised.

33:55.221 --> 33:57.420
- Can't everyone do that?
- How?

33:57.421 --> 33:59.220
Except the boot. The boot was mean!

33:59.221 --> 34:01.180
Never mind how,
he's dying to tell us that.

34:01.181 --> 34:02.500
I want to know why?

34:02.501 --> 34:06.180
Because Mrs Hudson's
right. I'm burning up.

34:06.181 --> 34:10.163
I'm at the bottom of a
pit and I'm still falling,

34:10.188 --> 34:11.947
and I'm never climbing out.

34:13.541 --> 34:15.179
I need you to know, John.

34:15.181 --> 34:18.300
I need you to see that up here,
I've still got it.

34:18.301 --> 34:21.020
So, when I tell you that
this is the most dangerous,

34:21.021 --> 34:24.620
the most despicable human being
that I have ever encountered,

34:24.621 --> 34:27.540
when I tell you that this,
this monster must be ended,

34:27.541 --> 34:30.780
please remember where you are
standing, because you're standing

34:30.781 --> 34:33.141
exactly where I said you
would be two weeks ago.

34:34.701 --> 34:40.139
I'm a mess, I'm in hell,
but I am not wrong, not about him.

34:40.141 --> 34:42.900
So, what has all this got to do with me?

34:42.900 --> 34:45.139
That creature, that rotting thing

34:45.165 --> 34:48.396
is a living, breathing
coagulation of human evil.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.219
And if the only thing I ever do in
this world is drive him out of it,

34:51.221 --> 34:53.021
then my life will not have been wasted.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.140
Look at me!

34:58.141 --> 34:59.541
Can't do it, not now.

35:00.781 --> 35:01.861
Not alone.

35:04.021 --> 35:05.421
All right.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.940
Yeah, well, they're real enough, I suppose.

35:14.941 --> 35:16.900
- Why would I be faking?
- Because you're a liar!

35:16.901 --> 35:18.740
You lie all the time,
it's like your mission!

35:18.741 --> 35:21.940
I have been many things, John,
but when have I ever been a malingerer?!

35:21.941 --> 35:23.860
You pretended to be dead for two years!

35:23.861 --> 35:25.900
Apart from that!
Listen, before I do anything,

35:25.901 --> 35:27.460
I need to know what state you're in.

35:27.461 --> 35:28.940
Well, you're a doctor, examine me.

35:28.941 --> 35:30.700
No, I need a second opinion.

35:30.701 --> 35:34.060
Oh, John, calm down. When have
you ever managed two opinions?

35:34.061 --> 35:35.700
You'd fall over.

35:35.701 --> 35:36.820
I need the one person who,

35:36.821 --> 35:39.180
unlike me, learned to see
through your bullshit long ago.

35:39.181 --> 35:41.220
Who's that, then?
I'm sure I would have noticed.

35:41.221 --> 35:43.940
The last person you'd think of.

35:43.941 --> 35:46.220
I want you to be examined by Molly Hooper.

35:46.221 --> 35:49.060
Do you hear me? I said Molly Hooper.

35:49.061 --> 35:51.180
You're really not going to like this.

35:51.181 --> 35:53.581
Like what?

35:57.541 --> 36:02.300
Um, hello. Is, er...
I'm sorry, Sherlock asked me to come.

36:02.301 --> 36:04.780
- What, two weeks ago?
- Yeah, about two weeks.

36:04.781 --> 36:06.900
If you'd like to know how
I predict the future...

36:06.901 --> 36:09.180
- No, I don't care how!
- OK, a fully equipped ambulance,

36:09.181 --> 36:11.220
Molly can examine me on the way,
it'll save time.

36:11.221 --> 36:12.620
- Ready to go, Molly?
- Um, well...

36:12.621 --> 36:13.980
Just tell me when to cough.

36:13.981 --> 36:15.660
I hope you remembered my coat.

36:15.661 --> 36:18.740
I'm sorry, I didn't know that
you were going to be here.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.940
Absolutely no idea what's going on.

36:20.941 --> 36:22.820
Sherlock's using again.

36:22.821 --> 36:25.500
Oh, God! Um, are... are you sure?

36:25.501 --> 36:29.021
No, it's Sherlock, of course
I'm not sure! Check him out.

36:32.541 --> 36:35.380
Is Molly the right person
to be doing medicals?

36:35.381 --> 36:37.780
She's more used to dead people.

36:37.781 --> 36:40.300
It's bound to lower your standards.

36:40.301 --> 36:43.260
I don't know. Yeah, I don't
know anything any more.

36:43.261 --> 36:46.420
- Mrs Hudson, as ever, you are amazing.
- No.

36:46.421 --> 36:49.660
You're going to have to buck up a bit,
John, you know that, don't you?

36:49.661 --> 36:51.340
The game is on.

36:51.341 --> 36:52.500
I'll do my best.

36:52.501 --> 36:56.740
Anything you need, any time,
just ask, anything at all.

36:56.741 --> 36:57.821
Thank you.

37:03.341 --> 37:06.380
Er, sometimes, can I borrow your car?

37:06.381 --> 37:08.501
No. OK.

37:13.701 --> 37:16.420
He knew you'd get a new
therapist after I died,

37:16.421 --> 37:18.500
because you'd need to change everything.

37:18.501 --> 37:20.221
That's just what you're like.

37:24.581 --> 37:26.100
Thanks.

37:26.101 --> 37:27.500
You keep your weekends for Rosie,

37:27.501 --> 37:29.580
so you needed to see someone
during working hours.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.700
Because you're an idiot,

37:30.701 --> 37:33.260
you don't want anyone at the
surgery knowing you're in therapy,

37:33.261 --> 37:35.060
so that restricts you
to lunchtime sessions,

37:35.061 --> 37:37.260
with someone reasonably close.

37:37.261 --> 37:39.900
You found four men and one woman.

37:39.901 --> 37:44.020
And you are done with the world
being explained to you by a man.

37:44.021 --> 37:46.900
Well, who isn't? So all he needed to do

37:46.901 --> 37:49.180
was find the first available
lunchtime appointment

37:49.181 --> 37:52.060
with a female therapist within
cycling distance of your surgery.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.100
My God, he knows you!

37:53.101 --> 37:54.620
No, he doesn't.

37:54.621 --> 37:57.500
I'm in your head, John.
You're disagreeing with yourself.

37:57.501 --> 37:58.740
Are you ready, sir?

37:58.741 --> 37:59.980
Yes, I am.

37:59.981 --> 38:03.700
He is the cleverest man in the world,
but he's not a monster.

38:03.701 --> 38:06.450
- Yeah, he is.
- Yeah, OK, all right, he is.

38:06.475 --> 38:08.285
Agh! But he's our monster.

38:09.941 --> 38:11.501
I'm a killer.

38:15.501 --> 38:16.741
You know I'm a killer.

38:19.061 --> 38:21.460
But did you know I'm a s...

38:21.461 --> 38:23.780
Cut there! What was that?

38:23.781 --> 38:25.060
Was that a light?

38:25.061 --> 38:28.620
Er, was that me? Was I too good?

38:28.621 --> 38:30.501
- Huh?
- He's here.

38:41.301 --> 38:43.180
Well, how is he?

38:43.181 --> 38:44.380
Basically fine.

38:44.381 --> 38:46.860
I've seen healthier people on the slab.

38:46.861 --> 38:48.980
Yeah, but to be fair,
you work with murder victims.

38:48.981 --> 38:50.180
They tend to be quite young.

38:50.181 --> 38:51.155
Not funny.

38:51.180 --> 38:53.226
- A little bit funny.
- If you keep taking

38:53.251 --> 38:56.020
what you're taking at the rate
you're taking it, you've got weeks.

38:56.021 --> 38:59.020
Exactly, weeks!
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

38:59.021 --> 39:01.180
For Christ's sake,
Sherlock, it's not a game!

39:01.181 --> 39:03.300
I'm worried about you, Molly,
you seem very stressed.

39:03.301 --> 39:05.580
- I'm stressed, you're dying!
- Yeah, well, I'm ahead, then.

39:05.581 --> 39:08.020
Stress can ruin every day of your life.
Dying can only ruin one.

39:08.021 --> 39:09.780
So this is real? You've really lost it?

39:09.781 --> 39:12.540
- You're actually out of control?
- When have I ever been that?

39:12.541 --> 39:14.380
- Since the day I met you.
- Oh, clever boy.

39:14.381 --> 39:15.680
I've missed you bumbling round the place.

39:15.704 --> 39:17.305
- I thought this was some kind of...
- What?

39:17.329 --> 39:18.060
Trick.

39:18.085 --> 39:20.343
This is not a trick, it's a plan.

39:20.344 --> 39:21.384
Mr Holmes!

39:22.685 --> 39:26.084
30 feet and closing, the most
significant undetected serial killer

39:26.109 --> 39:28.289
in British criminal history.
Help me bring him down.

39:28.314 --> 39:29.780
What? What plan?

39:29.805 --> 39:30.710
I'm not telling you.

39:30.735 --> 39:31.845
- Why not?
- Because you won't like it.

39:31.869 --> 39:32.909
Mr Holmes.

39:36.165 --> 39:40.484
I don't do handshakes.
It'll have to be a hug.

39:40.485 --> 39:41.645
I know.

39:43.025 --> 39:44.425
Oh, Sherlock.

39:46.925 --> 39:49.364
Oh, Sherlock, what can I say?

39:49.365 --> 39:51.924
Thanks to you, we're, er...
we're everywhere!

39:51.925 --> 39:55.164
Mr Holmes, how did
Culverton talk you into this?

39:55.165 --> 39:58.884
Well, he's a detective.
Maybe I just confessed.

40:01.021 --> 40:02.780
Come on.

40:02.781 --> 40:06.700
Now, it's a... it's a new
kind of breakfast cereal.

40:06.701 --> 40:08.180
Mr Holmes, could you put on the hat?

40:08.181 --> 40:09.900
Yeah, he doesn't really wear the hat.

40:09.901 --> 40:12.060
Kids will be getting two
of their five-a-day

40:12.061 --> 40:13.741
before they've even left home.

40:15.141 --> 40:17.420
Sherlock's been amazing for us.

40:17.421 --> 40:19.380
Breakfast has got to be cool.

40:19.381 --> 40:20.700
We're beyond viral.

40:20.701 --> 40:22.700
And you know what makes
it cool when you're a kid?

40:22.701 --> 40:24.180
What, sorry, beyond what?

40:24.181 --> 40:25.221
Dangerous!

40:26.621 --> 40:27.980
And action!

40:27.981 --> 40:31.021
I'm a killer. You know I'm a killer.

40:34.428 --> 40:36.707
But did you know

40:36.732 --> 40:38.798
I'm a cereal killer?

40:41.901 --> 40:42.981
Mmm!

40:44.221 --> 40:46.301
And cut there, thank you.

40:52.301 --> 40:56.740
We should bag that up, sell it.
Make money for that on eBay.

40:56.741 --> 41:00.312
You can make more if you want,
any time you like.

41:02.621 --> 41:06.500
Has it occurred to you,
anywhere in your drug-addled brain,

41:06.501 --> 41:08.940
- that you've just been played?
- Oh, yes.

41:08.941 --> 41:10.329
For an ad campaign.

41:10.354 --> 41:12.740
- Brilliant, isn't it?
- Brilliant?

41:12.741 --> 41:14.511
The safest place to hide.

41:16.381 --> 41:17.740
Plain sight.

41:17.741 --> 41:19.100
Mr Holmes?

41:19.101 --> 41:22.540
Culverton wants to know if you're
OK going straight to the hospital?

41:22.541 --> 41:23.780
Hospital?

41:23.781 --> 41:28.100
Culverton's doing a visit.
The kids would love to meet you both.

41:28.101 --> 41:30.540
I think he sort of promised.

41:30.541 --> 41:31.861
Oh, OK.

41:33.461 --> 41:35.741
If you'd just like to come this way.

41:39.981 --> 41:43.940
So, what are we doing here?
What's the point?

41:43.941 --> 41:45.981
I needed a hug.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.820
What do you think, Mr Holmes?
Cereal killer?

41:53.821 --> 41:55.581
It's funny cos it's true!

41:56.794 --> 41:58.833
See you at the hospital.

41:58.858 --> 42:00.978
Oh, you can have this back now.

42:04.541 --> 42:06.461
- Have what back?
- Thanks for the hug.

42:07.462 --> 42:09.101
Oh, I sent and deleted a text.

42:09.126 --> 42:10.646
You might get a reply, but I doubt it.

42:12.261 --> 42:14.260
- It's password protected.
- Oh, please!

42:16.061 --> 42:19.820
We're going to have endless fun,
Mr Holmes, aren't we?

42:19.821 --> 42:23.061
Oh, no. No, not endless.

42:29.501 --> 42:31.220
Need another hit, do you?

42:31.221 --> 42:32.741
I can wait until the hospital.

42:41.621 --> 42:42.941
Are you involved much?

42:43.793 --> 42:45.140
Sorry?

42:45.141 --> 42:48.700
Um, with Mr Holmes,
Sherlock, in all his cases?

42:48.701 --> 42:50.220
Er, yeah, I'm John Watson.

42:50.221 --> 42:51.540
OK.

42:51.541 --> 42:53.020
Dr Watson.

42:53.021 --> 42:54.460
I love his blog, don't you?

42:54.461 --> 42:55.620
His blog?

42:55.621 --> 42:57.660
- Why, don't you read it?
- You mean my blog.

42:57.661 --> 43:00.700
Say what you like about addiction,
the day is full of highlights!

43:00.701 --> 43:03.260
- Oh, Mr Holmes, you're feeling better?
- Psychedelic!

43:03.261 --> 43:05.010
I was just saying, I love your blog.

43:05.035 --> 43:06.380
- Great, thanks.
- It's my blog.

43:06.381 --> 43:07.646
It is, he writes the blog.

43:07.671 --> 43:09.125
- It's yours?
- Yes.

43:10.061 --> 43:11.340
You write Sherlock's blog?

43:11.341 --> 43:12.381
Yes.

43:13.981 --> 43:16.900
It's gone downhill a bit, hasn't it?

43:16.901 --> 43:18.661
It's this way, then.

43:25.981 --> 43:28.940
- Oh, my God, I love your blog.
- You're welcome.

43:28.941 --> 43:32.060
Right, here he comes, the internet tec.

43:32.061 --> 43:33.781
You all know Sherlock Holmes.

43:38.421 --> 43:41.261
Oh, and Dr Watson, of course.

43:44.461 --> 43:48.900
Mr Holmes, I was wondering,
well, we all were, weren't we,

43:48.901 --> 43:52.220
maybe you could tell us
about some of your cases?

43:52.221 --> 43:55.300
No. Yes. Yes. Absolutely, yes.

43:55.301 --> 43:58.900
The main feature of interest in
the field of criminal investigation

43:58.901 --> 44:01.660
is not the sensational
aspects of the crime itself,

44:01.661 --> 44:04.660
but rather the iron chain of reasoning,

44:04.661 --> 44:09.260
from cause to effect, that reveals,
step by step, the solution.

44:09.261 --> 44:12.100
That's the only truly remarkable
aspect of the entire affair.

44:12.101 --> 44:15.820
Now, I will share with you the
facts and evidence as they were

44:15.821 --> 44:18.100
available to me, and in this very room,

44:18.101 --> 44:22.180
you will all attempt to solve the
case of Blessington The Poisoner.

44:22.181 --> 44:24.380
I think you slightly gave away the ending.

44:24.381 --> 44:26.980
There were five main suspects.
One of them called Blessington.

44:26.981 --> 44:28.371
But it's more about how he did it.

44:28.396 --> 44:29.396
- Poison?
- OK.

44:30.741 --> 44:35.380
Drearcliff House, remember that one,
John? One murder, ten suspects.

44:35.381 --> 44:36.656
- Ten, yeah.
- All of them

44:36.681 --> 44:37.700
- guilty.
- Sherlock.

44:37.701 --> 44:40.500
Now, what did you call that one, John?

44:40.501 --> 44:42.660
Um, something to do
with murder at the zoo.

44:42.661 --> 44:44.620
Yeah, I called it Murder At The Zoo.

44:44.621 --> 44:47.181
Or was it the case of
The Killer Orang-utan?

44:49.625 --> 44:53.341
You should be wearing the hat.
The kids would love the hat.

44:54.421 --> 44:56.660
So, any more questions?

44:56.661 --> 44:58.820
No. I don't think so. No?

44:58.821 --> 44:59.900
Mr Holmes?

44:59.901 --> 45:01.820
Good, then I'll...

45:01.821 --> 45:03.661
How do you catch a serial killer?

45:06.781 --> 45:09.060
Same way you catch any other killer.

45:09.061 --> 45:12.820
No. Most killers kill someone they know.

45:12.821 --> 45:15.860
You're looking for a murderer
in a tiny social grouping.

45:15.861 --> 45:18.220
Um, Mr Smith, I'm just wondering,

45:18.221 --> 45:21.020
maybe this isn't a suitable
subject for the children.

45:21.021 --> 45:24.580
Nurse Cornish, how long
have you been with us now?

45:24.581 --> 45:25.941
Seven years.

45:28.421 --> 45:29.861
Seven years.

45:31.621 --> 45:32.781
OK.

45:36.581 --> 45:39.300
Serial killers choose
their victims at random.

45:39.301 --> 45:41.621
Surely that must make it more difficult.

45:42.657 --> 45:44.057
Some of them advertise.

45:45.145 --> 45:46.464
Do they really?

45:46.465 --> 45:49.384
Serial killing is an expression
of power, ego,

45:49.385 --> 45:53.225
a signature in human destruction.

45:54.265 --> 45:59.784
Ultimately, for full satisfaction,
it requires plain sight.

45:59.785 --> 46:03.184
Additionally,
serial killers are easily profiled.

46:03.185 --> 46:06.544
They tend to be social outcasts,
educationally subnormal.

46:06.545 --> 46:08.504
No, no, no, no, no, no.

46:08.505 --> 46:11.744
You're just talking about the ones
you know. The ones you've caught.

46:11.745 --> 46:14.864
But hello, dummy,
you only catch the dumb ones.

46:14.865 --> 46:20.024
Now, imagine if the Queen
wanted to kill some people,

46:20.025 --> 46:21.544
what would happen then?

46:21.545 --> 46:23.744
All that power, all that money,

46:23.745 --> 46:26.864
sweet little government,
dancing attendants.

46:26.865 --> 46:31.265
A whole country just to
keep her warm and fat.

46:33.425 --> 46:37.304
Hmm. We all love the Queen, don't we?

46:37.305 --> 46:38.824
And I bet she'd love you lot.

46:38.825 --> 46:41.184
It's all right, everyone,
I can personally assure you

46:41.185 --> 46:43.544
that Sherlock Holmes is not
about to arrest the Queen.

46:43.545 --> 46:46.664
Well, of course not. Not Her Majesty.

46:46.665 --> 46:53.784
Money, power, fame, some
things make you untouchable.

46:53.785 --> 46:55.064
God save the Queen!

46:55.065 --> 46:57.024
She could open a slaughterhouse

46:57.025 --> 46:58.984
and we'd all probably pay the entrance fee.

46:58.985 --> 47:02.025
- No-one's untouchable.
- No-one?

47:05.665 --> 47:10.164
Look at you all, so gloomy.
Can't you take a joke?

47:11.625 --> 47:13.144
The Queen!

47:13.145 --> 47:17.864
If the Queen was a serial killer,
I'd be the first person she'd tell.

47:17.865 --> 47:19.544
We have that kind of friendship.

47:19.545 --> 47:25.144
A big round of applause for
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.

47:25.145 --> 47:27.825
Come on. Wonderful.

47:29.865 --> 47:32.145
Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.

47:33.625 --> 47:34.904
Where are we going now?

47:34.905 --> 47:37.744
I want to show you my favourite room.

47:37.745 --> 47:39.785
No, let's go in here.

47:42.385 --> 47:45.024
So you've had another one
of your little meetings?

47:45.025 --> 47:47.504
Oh, it's just a monthly top-up.

47:47.505 --> 47:51.704
Confession is good for the soul,
providing you can delete it.

47:51.705 --> 47:52.744
What's TD 12?

47:52.745 --> 47:54.504
It's a memory inhibitor.

47:54.505 --> 47:56.184
Bliss.

47:56.185 --> 47:57.704
Bliss?

47:57.705 --> 48:01.224
Opt-in ignorance.
It makes the world go round.

48:01.225 --> 48:03.104
Anyone ever opt to remember?

48:03.105 --> 48:05.384
Some people take the drip out, yes.

48:05.385 --> 48:07.784
Some people have the same urges.

48:07.785 --> 48:09.784
Now, come on, wasting time.

48:09.785 --> 48:12.505
Indeed, you have,
I estimate, 20 minutes left.

48:13.936 --> 48:14.873
Sorry?

48:14.898 --> 48:16.095
I sent a text from
your phone, remember?

48:16.105 --> 48:17.664
It was read almost immediately.

48:17.665 --> 48:20.024
Factoring in a degree of
shock and emotional decision,

48:20.025 --> 48:22.504
and a journey time based
on the associated address,

48:22.505 --> 48:25.944
I'd say that your life, as you know it,
has 20 minutes left to run.

48:25.945 --> 48:28.384
Well, no, 17½ to be precise,

48:28.385 --> 48:29.864
but I rounded up for dramatic effect.

48:29.865 --> 48:32.224
So, please do show
us your favourite room.

48:32.225 --> 48:36.224
It'll give you a chance to say goodbye.

48:38.025 --> 48:39.585
Come along.

48:44.705 --> 48:48.705
The game is on. Do you still miss me?

48:52.905 --> 48:55.944
Speaking of serial killers,
you know who's my favourite?

48:55.945 --> 48:57.625
Other than yourself?

48:58.905 --> 49:01.824
HH Holmes. Relative of yours?

49:01.825 --> 49:03.386
Not as far as I know.

49:04.305 --> 49:07.265
You should check. What an idiot.

49:09.425 --> 49:10.465
Everyone out.

49:12.905 --> 49:15.305
Mr Smith,
we're actually in the middle of something.

49:17.425 --> 49:18.745
Saheed, isn't it?

49:19.785 --> 49:21.744
Saheed, yes.

49:21.745 --> 49:23.904
How long have you been working here now?

49:23.905 --> 49:26.729
- Four years.
- Four years.

49:26.754 --> 49:29.713
Well, that's a long time, isn't it?

49:30.105 --> 49:31.750
Four years!

49:34.826 --> 49:36.106
OK, everyone.

49:37.705 --> 49:39.464
Five minutes?

49:39.489 --> 49:40.809
Come back in ten.

49:47.657 --> 49:50.744
Saheed...

49:50.745 --> 49:52.265
this time, knock.

49:57.533 --> 49:59.024
How can you do that?

49:59.025 --> 50:01.704
I mean, how are you even allowed in here?

50:01.705 --> 50:03.425
Oh, I can go anywhere I like.

50:04.465 --> 50:05.744
Anywhere at all.

50:05.745 --> 50:07.104
They gave you keys?

50:07.105 --> 50:10.024
They presented them to me.
There was a ceremony.

50:10.025 --> 50:14.184
You can watch that on YouTube.
Home Secretary was there.

50:14.185 --> 50:16.744
So, your favourite room, the mortuary?

50:16.745 --> 50:18.104
What do you think?

50:18.105 --> 50:19.145
Tough crowd.

50:20.905 --> 50:22.264
Oh, I don't know.

50:22.265 --> 50:26.304
I've always found them quite pliable.

50:26.305 --> 50:30.025
- Don't do that!
- She's fine. She's dead.

50:32.305 --> 50:34.544
HH Holmes loved the dead.

50:34.545 --> 50:36.064
He mass-produced them.

50:36.065 --> 50:38.464
Serial killer,
active during the Chicago Fair.

50:38.465 --> 50:39.664
Do you know what he did?

50:39.665 --> 50:43.744
He built a hotel,
a special hotel just to kill people.

50:43.745 --> 50:49.504
You know, with a hanging room,
gas chamber, specially adapted furnace.

50:49.505 --> 50:52.424
You know, like Sweeney Todd...

50:52.425 --> 50:53.985
"Without the pies!"

50:55.665 --> 50:58.825
Stupid. So stupid.

51:00.345 --> 51:02.024
Why stupid?

51:02.025 --> 51:04.144
Well, all that effort.

51:04.145 --> 51:07.104
You don't build a beach if
you want to hide a pebble.

51:07.105 --> 51:09.504
You just find a beach.

51:09.505 --> 51:11.264
And if you want to hide a murder,

51:11.265 --> 51:16.225
if you want to hide lots and
lots of murders, just find a...

51:17.665 --> 51:18.865
...hospital.

51:19.985 --> 51:22.664
Can we be clear? Are you confessing?

51:22.665 --> 51:24.424
To what?

51:24.425 --> 51:25.945
The way you're talking...

51:27.225 --> 51:30.184
Oh, sorry, yes.

51:30.185 --> 51:33.864
You mean, am I a serial killer?

51:33.865 --> 51:37.104
Or am I just trying to mess
with your funny little head?

51:37.105 --> 51:38.744
Well, it's true.

51:38.745 --> 51:42.424
I do like to mess with people,
and, yes, I am a bit creepy.

51:42.425 --> 51:44.744
But that's just my USP.

51:44.745 --> 51:46.984
I use it to sell breakfast cereal.

51:46.985 --> 51:49.304
But am I what he says I am?

51:49.305 --> 51:51.064
Is that what you're asking?

51:51.065 --> 51:52.664
Yes.

51:52.665 --> 51:59.464
Hmm. Well, let me ask you this...
are you really a doctor?

51:59.465 --> 52:00.784
Yeah, of course I am.

52:00.785 --> 52:03.184
Oh, no, a medical doctor?

52:03.185 --> 52:07.264
You know, not just feet or
media studies or something?

52:07.265 --> 52:08.305
I'm a doctor.

52:10.345 --> 52:11.784
Are you serious?

52:11.785 --> 52:15.305
No, really, are you?

52:17.105 --> 52:18.224
Are you...

52:18.225 --> 52:21.225
are you actually serious?

52:22.225 --> 52:25.904
I've played along with this joke,
it's not funny any more.

52:25.905 --> 52:28.104
Look at him!

52:28.105 --> 52:31.064
Go ahead, look at him, Dr Watson!

52:31.065 --> 52:33.704
Oh, no, I'll lay it out for you.

52:33.705 --> 52:36.624
There are two possible explanations
for what's going on here.

52:36.625 --> 52:39.064
Either I'm a serial killer,

52:39.065 --> 52:43.104
or Sherlock Holmes is
off his tits on drugs!

52:43.105 --> 52:47.944
Hmm? Delusional paranoia
about a public personality.

52:47.945 --> 52:50.584
That's not so special, it's not even new.

52:50.585 --> 52:53.584
I think you need to tell
your faithful little friend

52:53.585 --> 52:55.304
how you're wasting his time,

52:55.305 --> 52:59.625
because you're too high to
know what's real any more.

53:05.145 --> 53:06.865
I apologise.

53:07.945 --> 53:09.945
I... I've miscalculated.

53:11.385 --> 53:14.024
I forgot to factor in the traffic.

53:14.025 --> 53:17.424
19½ minutes.

53:19.185 --> 53:22.224
Ah, the footsteps you're about to
hear will be very familiar to you,

53:22.225 --> 53:25.224
not least because there'll be
three impacts rather than two.

53:25.225 --> 53:27.824
The third, of course,
will be the end of a walking cane.

53:29.225 --> 53:31.824
Your daughter Faith's walking cane.

53:31.825 --> 53:33.784
And why would she be here?

53:33.785 --> 53:37.464
You invited her. You sent her a text.

53:37.465 --> 53:40.745
Or technically, I sent her a text,
but she's not to know.

53:42.425 --> 53:45.064
Now, let's see if I can recall.

53:45.065 --> 53:50.824
"Faith, I can stand it no longer,
I've confessed to my crimes.

53:50.825 --> 53:53.104
"Please forgive me."

53:53.105 --> 53:56.424
Why would that have any effect?
You don't know her.

53:56.425 --> 54:00.505
Oh, but I do. I spent
a whole evening with her.

54:01.625 --> 54:04.984
We had chips. I think she liked me.

54:04.985 --> 54:07.848
You don't know Faith. You simply do not.

54:07.873 --> 54:09.712
I know you care about her deeply.

54:10.345 --> 54:14.091
I know you invited her to one
of your special board meetings.

54:14.116 --> 54:16.196
You care what she thinks.

54:19.145 --> 54:21.665
You maintain an impressive facade.

54:23.345 --> 54:26.184
I think it's about to break.

54:26.185 --> 54:27.344
Did you know?

54:27.345 --> 54:28.864
She came to Baker Street.

54:28.865 --> 54:30.184
No, she didn't.

54:30.185 --> 54:31.344
Of course I didn't.

54:31.345 --> 54:35.984
She came to see me,
because she was scared of her daddy.

54:35.985 --> 54:41.264
Never happened. Is this another
one of your drug-fuelled fantasies?

54:41.265 --> 54:43.704
- You didn't see him take the scalpel?
- Nobody saw him.

54:43.705 --> 54:45.464
So you didn't know what
was about to happen?

54:45.465 --> 54:46.944
Of course I didn't know.

54:46.945 --> 54:48.104
Well, let's see, shall we?

54:48.105 --> 54:50.384
Faith, stop loitering at
the door and come in.

54:50.385 --> 54:52.733
This is your father's favourite room!

54:54.785 --> 54:56.864
Come and meet his best friends.

54:56.865 --> 55:01.064
Dad? What's happening?

55:01.065 --> 55:04.785
What was that text?
Are you having one of your jokes?

55:06.945 --> 55:08.425
Who are you?

55:26.705 --> 55:28.385
Who the hell are you?!

55:29.945 --> 55:32.384
It's Sherlock Holmes,
surely you recognise him?

55:32.385 --> 55:36.182
Oh, my God! Sherlock Holmes!

55:36.945 --> 55:39.024
I love your blog.

55:39.025 --> 55:41.584
You're not her, you're not the
woman who came to Baker Street.

55:41.585 --> 55:43.784
Um, well, no. Never been there.

55:43.785 --> 55:45.944
Well, there must have been some build-up,

55:45.945 --> 55:47.584
he didn't just suddenly do it.

55:47.585 --> 55:49.584
Look, I didn't know he
had the bloody scalpel!

55:49.585 --> 55:52.184
Sorry, I'm not sure I
completely understand.

55:52.185 --> 55:53.704
Understand what?

55:53.705 --> 55:56.824
Well, I thought you two were...
were old friends?

55:56.825 --> 55:58.944
No. We've never met.

55:58.945 --> 56:01.184
Oh, dear. Oh!

56:01.185 --> 56:02.704
Have we?

56:02.705 --> 56:04.465
Sherlock?

56:05.505 --> 56:07.544
So, who came to my flat?

56:07.545 --> 56:09.104
Well, it wasn't me.

56:09.105 --> 56:10.544
No!

56:12.745 --> 56:14.784
You look different.

56:14.785 --> 56:16.304
I wasn't there.

56:16.305 --> 56:18.584
'Who came to my flat?'

56:18.585 --> 56:20.704
I'm sorry, Mr Holmes,

56:20.705 --> 56:24.504
but I don't think I've ever
been anywhere near your flat.

56:24.505 --> 56:28.864
Oh, dear. Oh, no!

56:28.865 --> 56:30.264
Who are you talking to?

56:30.265 --> 56:32.144
What friend?

56:32.145 --> 56:33.384
Anyone.

56:33.385 --> 56:36.224
Oh, no. Oh, no!

56:39.865 --> 56:41.344
'Faith?

56:41.345 --> 56:43.065
Oh, God!'

56:47.905 --> 56:50.904
Oh, no. Oh, no!

56:55.265 --> 56:56.305
Sherlock?

56:57.425 --> 56:59.464
Sherlock, are you all right?
Sherlock, are you OK?

56:59.465 --> 57:01.584
- Watch him, he's got a knife.
- I've got a what?

57:01.585 --> 57:04.624
You've got a scalpel, you picked it
up from that table! I saw you take it.

57:04.625 --> 57:06.184
I certainly did not!

57:06.185 --> 57:07.624
Look behind his back!

57:07.625 --> 57:08.784
No...

57:08.785 --> 57:10.384
I saw you take it! I saw you!

57:10.385 --> 57:12.304
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

57:12.305 --> 57:14.304
Sherlock, do you want to put that down?

57:14.305 --> 57:16.505
Oh, my God!

57:17.505 --> 57:18.824
Stop laughing at me.

57:18.825 --> 57:20.904
- I'm not laughing.
- He's not laughing, Sherlock.

57:20.905 --> 57:22.705
- Stop laughing at me!
- Sherlock!

57:24.505 --> 57:31.144
Oh, Christ! I keep wondering if
we should have seen it coming.

57:31.145 --> 57:33.304
Not long ago he shot Charles
Magnussen in the face,

57:33.305 --> 57:34.464
we did see it coming.

57:34.465 --> 57:37.064
We always saw it coming. But it was fun.

57:38.425 --> 57:39.704
Come in.

57:39.705 --> 57:42.465
Sir, you probably want to see this.

57:45.625 --> 57:48.824
'Harold Chorley
reporting earlier today.

57:48.825 --> 57:52.224
'Mr Smith stated he had no
interest in bringing charges.'

57:52.225 --> 57:55.064
'I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes,
I'm a big fan.

57:55.065 --> 57:58.664
'I don't really know what happened
today. To be honest,

57:58.665 --> 58:03.064
'I don't think I'd be standing here
now if it wasn't for Dr Watson.'

58:03.065 --> 58:05.144
Stop laughing at me!

58:05.145 --> 58:06.584
Sherlock!

58:08.425 --> 58:11.024
Stop it! Stop it now!

58:11.025 --> 58:13.904
'Is it true he's
being treated in your hospital?'

58:13.905 --> 58:15.704
'It's not actually my hospital.'

58:15.705 --> 58:17.584
Well, it is a little bit my hospital.

58:17.585 --> 58:21.944
But I can promise you this,
he is going to get the best of care.

58:21.945 --> 58:24.584
I might even move him to my favourite room.

58:24.585 --> 58:27.625
'Culverton Smith,
earlier today. In Nottingham...'

58:33.105 --> 58:35.984
He's right, you know,
you probably saved his life.

58:35.985 --> 58:38.664
What are you doing?! Wake up!

58:38.665 --> 58:41.305
I really hit him, Greg. Hit him hard.

58:44.203 --> 58:48.265
Is this a game? Is it just a bloody game?

58:56.065 --> 59:01.584
Please! Please, please, please, no
violence. Thank you, Dr Watson.

59:01.585 --> 59:05.984
But I don't think he's a danger any more.

59:05.985 --> 59:07.344
Leave him be.

59:07.345 --> 59:09.345
No, it's OK.

59:12.265 --> 59:16.145
Let him do what he wants. He's entitled.

59:19.185 --> 59:20.545
I killed his wife.

59:23.145 --> 59:24.545
Yes, you did.

01:00:01.745 --> 01:00:03.225
Oh, hi.

01:00:06.305 --> 01:00:07.824
Just in to say hello?

01:00:07.825 --> 01:00:09.384
No. I'm just in to say goodbye.

01:00:09.385 --> 01:00:11.464
I'm sure he'll pull through.

01:00:11.465 --> 01:00:15.664
And yeah, he's made a terrible mess
of himself, but he's awfully strong.

01:00:15.665 --> 01:00:17.465
So, must look on the bright side.

01:00:20.945 --> 01:00:22.225
Hm.

01:00:25.545 --> 01:00:27.265
Well...

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:31.744
Parting gift. Ah, that's nice.

01:00:31.745 --> 01:00:33.144
A walking stick.

01:00:33.145 --> 01:00:35.585
Yeah, it was mine, from a long time ago.

01:00:38.465 --> 01:00:40.984
Hello? Ward 73.

01:00:40.985 --> 01:00:42.944
Oh, er, Dr Watson?

01:00:42.945 --> 01:00:44.104
Hm?

01:00:44.105 --> 01:00:45.545
It's for you.

01:00:46.625 --> 01:00:47.665
Oh.

01:00:50.385 --> 01:00:51.984
Hello, Mycroft.

01:00:51.985 --> 01:00:53.305
'There's a car downstairs.'

01:00:57.305 --> 01:01:00.384
You know, he should
definitely have worn the hat.

01:01:00.385 --> 01:01:01.864
Still thinking about Sherlock?

01:01:01.865 --> 01:01:03.184
No. You are.

01:01:03.185 --> 01:01:05.264
You've got your disapproving face on.

01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:07.144
Well, seeing as I'm inside your head,

01:01:07.145 --> 01:01:08.865
I think we can call that self-loathing.

01:01:59.665 --> 01:02:01.183
Where is she?
Where's Mrs Hudson?

01:02:01.208 --> 01:02:02.344
She'll be up in a moment.

01:02:02.345 --> 01:02:03.624
What are you doing?

01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:06.384
Have you noticed the kitchen?
It's practically a meth lab.

01:02:06.385 --> 01:02:09.344
I'm trying to establish exactly
what drove Sherlock off the rails.

01:02:09.345 --> 01:02:11.065
Any ideas? Are these spooks?

01:02:12.745 --> 01:02:15.744
Are you using spooks now
to look after your family?

01:02:15.745 --> 01:02:18.584
- Hang on, are they tidying?
- Sherlock is a security concern.

01:02:18.585 --> 01:02:20.544
The fact that I'm his
brother changes nothing.

01:02:20.545 --> 01:02:22.864
- Yeah, you've said that before.
- Ask him.

01:02:22.865 --> 01:02:25.744
Why fixate on Culverton Smith?

01:02:25.745 --> 01:02:27.944
He's had his obsessions before,
of course, but

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:30.744
this goes a bit further than setting
a man-trap for Father Christmas.

01:02:30.745 --> 01:02:32.224
Do it. Ask him.

01:02:32.225 --> 01:02:34.584
Spending all night talking to
a woman who wasn't even there.

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:35.744
Oh, shut up, you!

01:02:35.745 --> 01:02:38.464
- Mycroft, last time, when we were on the phone...
- No, no, no, no, stop.

01:02:38.465 --> 01:02:40.864
I detest conversation in the past tense.

01:02:40.865 --> 01:02:43.424
You said the fact that you were
his brother made no difference.

01:02:43.425 --> 01:02:44.904
It doesn't.

01:02:44.905 --> 01:02:47.424
You said it didn't the last time,
and it wouldn't with Sherlock.

01:02:47.425 --> 01:02:49.544
So who was it the last time?
Who were you talking about?

01:02:49.545 --> 01:02:50.704
Attaboy!

01:02:50.705 --> 01:02:54.224
Nobody. I... misspoke.

01:02:54.225 --> 01:02:55.944
He's lying. You're lying.

01:02:55.945 --> 01:02:58.105
I assure you, I'm not. He really is lying.

01:02:59.745 --> 01:03:01.385
Sherlock's not your only brother.

01:03:02.825 --> 01:03:04.824
There's another one, isn't there?

01:03:04.825 --> 01:03:07.784
- No...
- Jesus! A secret brother.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:11.184
What is he, locked up in a tower,
or something?

01:03:11.185 --> 01:03:12.584
Mycroft Holmes!

01:03:12.585 --> 01:03:15.464
What are all these dreadful
people doing in my house?!

01:03:15.465 --> 01:03:17.544
Mrs Hudson, I apologise
for the interruption.

01:03:17.545 --> 01:03:19.624
As you know, my brother has embarked on

01:03:19.625 --> 01:03:22.864
a programme of self-destruction
remarkable even by his standards,

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:25.424
and I am endeavouring to
find out what triggered it.

01:03:25.425 --> 01:03:27.824
- And that's what you're all looking for?
- Quite so.

01:03:27.825 --> 01:03:29.944
What's on his mind? So to speak.

01:03:29.945 --> 01:03:31.504
And you've had all this time?

01:03:31.505 --> 01:03:34.104
Time being something of which we
don't have an infinite supply,

01:03:34.105 --> 01:03:36.344
so if we could be about our business.

01:03:38.705 --> 01:03:41.064
You... you're so funny, you are!

01:03:41.065 --> 01:03:42.704
Mrs Hudson?

01:03:42.705 --> 01:03:46.744
He thinks you're clever, poor old
Sherlock. Always going on about you.

01:03:46.745 --> 01:03:48.264
I mean, he knows you're an idiot,

01:03:48.265 --> 01:03:50.424
but that's OK, cos you're a lovely doctor.

01:03:50.425 --> 01:03:53.584
But he has no idea what an idiot you are!

01:03:53.585 --> 01:03:55.744
Is this merely
stream-of-consciousness abuse,

01:03:55.745 --> 01:03:57.504
or are you attempting to make a point?

01:03:57.505 --> 01:03:59.424
You want to know what's bothering Sherlock?

01:03:59.425 --> 01:04:02.224
Easiest thing in the world,
anyone can do it.

01:04:02.225 --> 01:04:05.184
I know his thought processes
better than any other human being,

01:04:05.185 --> 01:04:06.664
so, please, try to understand.

01:04:06.665 --> 01:04:09.584
He's not about thinking. Not Sherlock.

01:04:09.585 --> 01:04:11.344
- Of course he is.
- No, no.

01:04:11.345 --> 01:04:13.424
He's more emotional, isn't he?

01:04:13.425 --> 01:04:16.864
Unsolved case, shoot
the wall! Boom, boom!

01:04:16.865 --> 01:04:19.344
Unmade breakfast, karate the fridge.

01:04:19.345 --> 01:04:20.584
Unanswered question...

01:04:20.585 --> 01:04:24.824
Well, what does he do with anything
he can't answer, John? Every time?

01:04:24.825 --> 01:04:26.384
He stabs it.

01:04:26.385 --> 01:04:31.344
Anything he can't find the
answer for, bang! It's up there.

01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:34.304
I keep telling him,
if he was any good as a detective,

01:04:34.305 --> 01:04:36.105
I wouldn't need a new mantel!

01:04:39.945 --> 01:04:44.384
'If you're watching this,
I'm... probably dead.'

01:04:44.385 --> 01:04:47.264
OK, no. Stop that now, please.

01:04:47.265 --> 01:04:49.384
Everybody out, now!

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.264
All of you!

01:04:51.265 --> 01:04:55.464
This is my house, this is my friend,
and that's his departed wife.

01:04:55.465 --> 01:04:58.584
Anyone who stays here a minute
longer is admitting to me personally

01:04:58.585 --> 01:05:01.465
they do not have a single
spark of human decency.

01:05:11.545 --> 01:05:14.745
Get out of my house, you reptile!

01:05:24.265 --> 01:05:26.424
You've been ages waking up.

01:05:26.425 --> 01:05:27.665
I watched you.

01:05:29.945 --> 01:05:31.745
It was quite lovely, in its way.

01:05:32.985 --> 01:05:35.664
Take it easy, it's OK.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:37.425
Don't want to rush this.

01:05:39.265 --> 01:05:41.464
You're Sherlock Holmes.

01:05:41.465 --> 01:05:44.024
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

01:05:44.025 --> 01:05:46.784
Might be the hardest case of your career.

01:05:46.785 --> 01:05:50.504
When I'm... gone,

01:05:50.505 --> 01:05:52.504
if I'm gone,

01:05:52.505 --> 01:05:54.505
I need you to do something for me.

01:05:56.292 --> 01:05:57.772
Save John Watson.

01:05:58.625 --> 01:06:01.144
Save him, Sherlock.'

01:06:01.145 --> 01:06:03.584
John, if you want to watch this later...

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:05.384
'Save him.

01:06:05.385 --> 01:06:07.504
Don't think anyone else
is going to save him,

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:08.944
because there isn't anyone.

01:06:08.945 --> 01:06:10.744
It's up to you.

01:06:10.745 --> 01:06:12.104
Save him.

01:06:12.105 --> 01:06:14.744
But I do think you're going to
need a little bit of help with that,

01:06:14.745 --> 01:06:16.664
because you're not
exactly good with people,

01:06:16.665 --> 01:06:20.544
so here's a few things you need
to know about the man we both love.

01:06:20.545 --> 01:06:23.585
And more importantly, what you're
going to need to do to save him.'

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:30.265
How did you... get in?

01:06:32.105 --> 01:06:33.425
Policeman outside, you mean?

01:06:34.465 --> 01:06:37.145
Come on, can't you guess?

01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:41.157
Secret door.

01:06:41.905 --> 01:06:43.545
I built this whole wing.

01:06:44.865 --> 01:06:47.304
I kept firing the architects and builders,

01:06:47.305 --> 01:06:51.344
so no-one knew quite how
it all fitted together.

01:06:51.345 --> 01:06:55.665
I can slip in and out,
anywhere I like, you know.

01:06:57.105 --> 01:06:58.544
When I get the urge.

01:06:58.545 --> 01:07:00.904
HH Holmes.

01:07:00.905 --> 01:07:03.925
Murder Castle. But done right.

01:07:05.065 --> 01:07:08.144
I have a question for you.
Why are you here?

01:07:08.145 --> 01:07:11.665
It's like you walked into my den
and laid down in front of me.

01:07:12.865 --> 01:07:13.985
Why?

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:17.224
You know why I'm here.

01:07:17.225 --> 01:07:19.185
I'd like to hear you say it.

01:07:20.625 --> 01:07:22.145
Say it for me, please.

01:07:24.985 --> 01:07:26.797
I want you to kill me.

01:07:31.745 --> 01:07:33.025
John?

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:36.705
My car.

01:07:41.465 --> 01:07:44.344
If you increased the
dosage four or five times,

01:07:44.345 --> 01:07:48.184
toxic shock should shut me
down within about an hour.

01:07:48.185 --> 01:07:50.664
Then I restore the settings.

01:07:50.665 --> 01:07:53.305
Everyone assumes it was a fault, or...

01:07:54.705 --> 01:07:57.465
- ...you just gave up the ghost.
- Yes.

01:07:59.065 --> 01:08:00.945
You're rather good at this.

01:08:03.265 --> 01:08:06.345
Before we start, tell me how you feel.

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:11.425
I... I feel scared.

01:08:13.025 --> 01:08:15.024
Be more specific.

01:08:15.025 --> 01:08:17.064
You only get to do this the once.

01:08:18.225 --> 01:08:19.585
I'm scared of dying.

01:08:20.944 --> 01:08:22.465
You wanted this, though.

01:08:25.104 --> 01:08:26.904
I have reasons.

01:08:26.904 --> 01:08:29.584
But you don't actually want to die.

01:08:29.585 --> 01:08:31.224
No.

01:08:31.225 --> 01:08:32.385
Good.

01:08:35.265 --> 01:08:36.747
Say that for me.

01:08:37.745 --> 01:08:39.665
- Say it.
- I don't want to die.

01:08:41.585 --> 01:08:42.904
And again.

01:08:42.904 --> 01:08:45.465
I don't... want to die.

01:08:49.185 --> 01:08:50.895
Once more, for luck.

01:08:51.984 --> 01:08:53.625
I don't want to die.

01:08:54.785 --> 01:08:56.584
I don't.

01:08:56.585 --> 01:08:58.064
I don't want to die.

01:08:59.825 --> 01:09:01.064
Lovely.

01:09:04.064 --> 01:09:05.385
Here it comes.

01:09:13.625 --> 01:09:15.304
Please, I don't think he's safe.

01:09:15.328 --> 01:09:16.964
'No, he's fine,
I've got a man on the door.'

01:09:16.988 --> 01:09:19.783
- 'What do you think's happened?'
- I don't know, something!

01:09:19.785 --> 01:09:21.743
- Mary left a message.
- What message?

01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:25.584
'John Watson never accepts help.

01:09:25.585 --> 01:09:27.783
Not from anyone, not ever.

01:09:27.785 --> 01:09:30.304
But here's the thing,
he never refuses it.

01:09:30.305 --> 01:09:32.665
So, here's what you are going to do.'

01:09:34.345 --> 01:09:36.863
So, tell me, why are we doing this?

01:09:36.865 --> 01:09:38.520
To what do I owe the pleasure?

01:09:39.545 --> 01:09:41.464
I wanted to hear your confession,

01:09:41.465 --> 01:09:43.944
needed to know I was right.

01:09:43.944 --> 01:09:46.264
But why do you need to die?

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.745
The mortuary, your favourite room.

01:09:51.865 --> 01:09:53.984
You talk to the dead.

01:09:53.984 --> 01:09:56.505
You make your confession to them.

01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:02.065
Sorry, sir, what? What do you mean?

01:10:03.785 --> 01:10:05.304
I think the door's jammed.

01:10:05.305 --> 01:10:07.624
Oh, has that door locked itself again?

01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:09.104
Yeah, it's always doing that.

01:10:09.105 --> 01:10:12.344
'You can't save John,
because he won't let you.

01:10:12.345 --> 01:10:14.665
He won't allow himself to be saved.

01:10:16.385 --> 01:10:20.584
The only way to save John
is to make him save you.'

01:10:20.585 --> 01:10:21.825
Why do you do it?

01:10:24.065 --> 01:10:25.105
Why do I kill?

01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:29.762
It's not about hatred, or... or revenge.

01:10:30.844 --> 01:10:32.604
I'm not a dark person.

01:10:33.425 --> 01:10:35.264
Killing human beings...

01:10:41.145 --> 01:10:46.145
...it just makes me...
oh, incredibly happy.

01:10:52.905 --> 01:10:57.304
You know, in films, when you see
dead people, pretending to be dead,

01:10:57.305 --> 01:11:00.225
and it's just living people lying down?

01:11:02.265 --> 01:11:04.904
Well, that's not what
dead people look like.

01:11:04.905 --> 01:11:08.945
Dead people... look like things.

01:11:10.225 --> 01:11:13.784
I like to make people into things,

01:11:13.785 --> 01:11:16.184
then you can own them.

01:11:16.185 --> 01:11:19.065
You know what?
I'm getting a little impatient.

01:11:34.825 --> 01:11:36.465
Take a big breath if you want.

01:11:37.705 --> 01:11:39.465
'Go to hell, Sherlock.

01:11:42.185 --> 01:11:45.744
Go right into hell and make
it look like you mean it.'

01:11:45.745 --> 01:11:48.824
Murder is a very difficult
addiction to manage.

01:11:48.825 --> 01:11:51.464
People don't realise how
much work goes into it.

01:11:51.465 --> 01:11:53.024
You have to be careful.

01:11:53.025 --> 01:11:57.064
But if you're rich or
famous and... loved,

01:11:57.065 --> 01:12:00.745
it's amazing what people
are prepared to ignore.

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:05.224
But there's always someone
desperate about to go missing,

01:12:05.225 --> 01:12:08.784
and no-one wants to suspect murder

01:12:08.785 --> 01:12:11.824
if it's easier to suspect something else.

01:12:11.825 --> 01:12:15.944
I just have to ration myself,
choose the right heart to stop.

01:12:15.945 --> 01:12:21.384
'Go and pick a fight with a bad guy,
put yourself in harm's way.'

01:12:21.385 --> 01:12:24.304
Please! Maintain eye contact.

01:12:24.305 --> 01:12:26.264
Maintain eye contact.

01:12:26.265 --> 01:12:28.424
Maintain eye contact!

01:12:28.449 --> 01:12:32.120
I like to watch it happen.

01:12:32.145 --> 01:12:34.665
'If he thinks you need him, I swear...'

01:12:40.305 --> 01:12:44.465
And off we... pop.

01:12:45.865 --> 01:12:47.584
'...he will be there.'

01:12:49.905 --> 01:12:52.584
Mr Holmes, are you OK?

01:12:52.585 --> 01:12:55.304
What were you doing to him?!
What were you doing?!

01:12:55.305 --> 01:12:58.344
- He's in distress, I'm helping him.
- Restrain him now. Do it.

01:12:58.345 --> 01:12:59.904
I was trying to help him!

01:12:59.905 --> 01:13:03.384
- Sherlock, what was he doing to you?
- Suffocating me, overdosing me.

01:13:03.385 --> 01:13:04.509
- On what?
- Saline.

01:13:04.534 --> 01:13:05.984
- Saline?
- Yes, saline.

01:13:05.985 --> 01:13:07.904
What do you mean, saline?

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:11.464
Well, obviously, I got Nurse
Cornish to switch the bags.

01:13:11.465 --> 01:13:14.304
She's a big fan, you know? Loves my blog.

01:13:14.305 --> 01:13:16.704
- You're OK?
- No, no, of course I'm not OK.

01:13:16.705 --> 01:13:18.384
Malnourished, double kidney failure,

01:13:18.385 --> 01:13:20.384
and frankly,
I've been off my tits for weeks.

01:13:20.385 --> 01:13:22.104
What kind of a doctor are you?

01:13:24.225 --> 01:13:25.904
I got my confession, though, didn't I?

01:13:25.905 --> 01:13:28.744
Well, I don't recall making any confession.

01:13:28.745 --> 01:13:31.544
- What would I be confessing to?
- You can listen to it later.

01:13:31.545 --> 01:13:33.824
Well, there is no confession to listen to.

01:13:33.825 --> 01:13:37.104
Oh, Mr Holmes, I don't
know if this is relevant, but...

01:13:37.105 --> 01:13:41.224
we found three potential recording
devices in the pockets of your coat.

01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:43.104
All your possessions were searched.

01:13:43.105 --> 01:13:44.305
Sorry!

01:13:47.225 --> 01:13:50.264
Must be something comforting
about the number three,

01:13:50.265 --> 01:13:53.065
people always give up after three.

01:13:56.985 --> 01:13:58.665
What? What is it? What?

01:14:03.745 --> 01:14:06.264
- You cock!
- Yeah.

01:14:06.265 --> 01:14:08.945
Utter, utter cock. Heard
you the first time.

01:14:14.385 --> 01:14:16.905
- So, how does it open?
- Screw the top.

01:14:24.065 --> 01:14:26.024
- Two weeks ago?
- Three.

01:14:26.025 --> 01:14:28.785
- I'm that predictable?
- No.

01:14:30.945 --> 01:14:32.265
I'm just a cock.

01:14:43.465 --> 01:14:45.544
It's funny.

01:14:45.545 --> 01:14:49.064
I never realised confessing
would be so enjoyable.

01:14:49.065 --> 01:14:50.985
I should have done it sooner.

01:14:52.865 --> 01:14:54.624
We'll carry on tomorrow.

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:57.944
Well, we could carry on now, I'm not tired.

01:14:57.945 --> 01:14:59.344
There's loads more.

01:14:59.345 --> 01:15:01.064
Tomorrow.

01:15:01.065 --> 01:15:04.544
You know, I am going to be so famous now.

01:15:04.545 --> 01:15:06.344
You're already famous.

01:15:06.345 --> 01:15:08.545
Yeah, but with this...

01:15:10.225 --> 01:15:11.825
...I can break America.

01:15:15.785 --> 01:15:18.824
I had, of course,
several other backup plans.

01:15:18.825 --> 01:15:21.584
Trouble is, I couldn't
remember what they were.

01:15:21.585 --> 01:15:24.384
And, of course, I hadn't really anticipated

01:15:24.385 --> 01:15:27.064
that I'd hallucinated meeting his daughter.

01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:29.784
Basically, he trashed himself
on drugs so that you'd help him,

01:15:29.785 --> 01:15:31.984
so that you'd have something to do,
something doctory.

01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:33.264
You get that now?

01:15:33.265 --> 01:15:35.464
Still a bit troubled by the daughter.

01:15:35.465 --> 01:15:37.184
It did seem very real.

01:15:37.185 --> 01:15:40.104
She gave me information I
couldn't have acquired elsewhere.

01:15:40.105 --> 01:15:42.184
But she wasn't ever here?

01:15:42.185 --> 01:15:43.424
Interesting, isn't it?

01:15:43.425 --> 01:15:45.744
I have theorised before that
if one could attenuate to

01:15:45.745 --> 01:15:48.064
every available data stream
in the world simultaneously,

01:15:48.065 --> 01:15:51.305
it would be possible to anticipate
and deduce almost anything.

01:15:52.745 --> 01:15:54.224
Hmm.

01:15:54.225 --> 01:15:57.304
So, you dreamed up a magic woman
who told you things you didn't know?

01:15:57.305 --> 01:16:01.104
Well, sounds about right to me.
Possibly, I'm biased.

01:16:01.105 --> 01:16:04.945
Perhaps the drugs opened
certain doors in my mind.

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.540
- I'm intrigued.
- I know you are.

01:16:10.425 --> 01:16:13.584
Which is why we're all taking it in
turns to keep you off the sweeties.

01:16:13.585 --> 01:16:15.305
I thought we were just hanging out.

01:16:18.345 --> 01:16:20.024
Molly will be here in 20 minutes.

01:16:20.025 --> 01:16:23.465
Oh, I do think I can last 20
minutes without supervision.

01:16:25.585 --> 01:16:27.624
Well, if you're sure.

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.505
Christ, John, stay, talk!

01:16:30.945 --> 01:16:33.704
Uh, sorry, it's just, um, you know, Rosie.

01:16:33.705 --> 01:16:35.264
Yes, of course, Rosie.

01:16:35.265 --> 01:16:38.384
Go and solve a crime together,
make him wear the hat.

01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:41.024
- You'll be OK for 20 minutes?
- Yes, yes.

01:16:41.025 --> 01:16:43.664
- Sorry, I... I wasn't thinking of Rosie.
- No problem.

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:46.305
I should, er, come and see her soon.

01:16:47.825 --> 01:16:50.544
Yes. Actually, he should wear the
hat as a special tribute to me.

01:16:50.545 --> 01:16:53.024
I'm dead, I would really appreciate it.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:56.184
Oh, by the way, the recordings
will probably be inadmissible.

01:16:56.185 --> 01:16:58.224
- Sorry, what?
- Well, technically, it's entrapment,

01:16:58.225 --> 01:17:00.104
so it might get thrown out as evidence.

01:17:00.105 --> 01:17:03.064
Not that that matters.
Apparently he can't stop confessing.

01:17:03.065 --> 01:17:04.705
- That's good.
- Yeah.

01:17:11.465 --> 01:17:13.704
Are you OK?

01:17:13.705 --> 01:17:15.384
What, am I...? No, no, I'm not OK.

01:17:15.385 --> 01:17:17.184
I'm never going to be OK.

01:17:17.185 --> 01:17:19.424
And we'll just have to accept that.

01:17:19.425 --> 01:17:20.704
It is what it is,

01:17:20.705 --> 01:17:23.304
and what it is is... shit.

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.345
John, do better.

01:17:27.785 --> 01:17:31.264
You didn't kill Mary.
Mary died saving your life.

01:17:31.265 --> 01:17:33.184
It was her choice, no-one made her do it.

01:17:33.185 --> 01:17:34.824
No-one could ever make her do anything.

01:17:34.825 --> 01:17:37.074
The point is, you did not kill her.

01:17:39.545 --> 01:17:42.145
In saving my life,
she conferred a value on it.

01:17:44.465 --> 01:17:46.785
It is a currency I do
not know how to spend.

01:17:51.145 --> 01:17:52.745
It is what it is.

01:17:56.585 --> 01:17:58.784
I'm tomorrow, six till ten.
I'll see you then.

01:17:58.785 --> 01:18:02.424
- Looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

01:18:05.945 --> 01:18:08.024
That noise, that's a text alert noise?

01:18:08.025 --> 01:18:09.185
What was that?

01:18:10.865 --> 01:18:12.424
Hmm? What was what?

01:18:12.425 --> 01:18:14.224
That's the text alert of Irene Adler.

01:18:14.225 --> 01:18:15.784
She's the scary mad one, right?

01:18:15.785 --> 01:18:18.384
- That noise?
- What noise?

01:18:18.385 --> 01:18:19.664
But she's dead.

01:18:19.665 --> 01:18:22.464
Ooh, I bet she isn't dead!

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:24.384
I bet he saved her.

01:18:24.385 --> 01:18:26.144
Oh, my God!

01:18:26.145 --> 01:18:28.864
Oh, the posh boy loves the dominatrix.

01:18:28.865 --> 01:18:31.544
He's never knowingly under-cliched, is he?

01:18:31.545 --> 01:18:33.384
John?

01:18:33.385 --> 01:18:36.144
- I'm going to make a deduction.
- Oh, OK, that's good.

01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:37.624
And if my deduction is right,

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:39.904
you're going to be
honest and tell me, OK?

01:18:39.929 --> 01:18:40.664
OK.

01:18:40.665 --> 01:18:43.464
Though I should mention that it is
possible for any given text alert

01:18:43.465 --> 01:18:46.425
- to become randomly attached to...
- Happy birthday.

01:18:49.745 --> 01:18:52.664
Thank you, John, that's...
very kind of you.

01:18:52.665 --> 01:18:54.664
Never knew when your birthday was.

01:18:54.665 --> 01:18:56.544
Well, now you do.

01:18:56.545 --> 01:18:57.958
Seriously, we're not going to

01:18:57.983 --> 01:18:59.664
- talk about this?
- Talk about what?

01:18:59.665 --> 01:19:01.744
I mean, how does it work?
How does what work?

01:19:01.745 --> 01:19:03.104
You and The Woman.

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:05.064
Do you go to a discreet
Harvester sometimes?

01:19:05.065 --> 01:19:07.984
Is there nights of passion in High Wycombe?

01:19:07.985 --> 01:19:10.904
Oh, for God's sakes, I don't text her back!

01:19:10.905 --> 01:19:12.344
Why not?

01:19:12.345 --> 01:19:14.824
You bloody moron!

01:19:14.825 --> 01:19:18.664
She's out there,
she likes you and she's alive!

01:19:18.665 --> 01:19:20.584
And do you have the first idea

01:19:20.585 --> 01:19:21.944
how lucky you are?!

01:19:21.945 --> 01:19:26.144
Yes, she's a lunatic, she's a criminal,
she's insanely dangerous.

01:19:26.145 --> 01:19:28.824
Trust you to fall for a sociopath!
Oh, married an assassin!

01:19:28.825 --> 01:19:30.265
But she's, you know...

01:19:31.825 --> 01:19:33.045
- What?
- Just text

01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:34.264
- her back.
- Why?

01:19:34.265 --> 01:19:35.984
Because High Wycombe is better than

01:19:35.985 --> 01:19:38.704
you are currently equipped to understand!

01:19:38.705 --> 01:19:40.944
I once caught a triple
poisoner in High Wycombe.

01:19:40.945 --> 01:19:42.744
That's only the beginning, mate.

01:19:42.745 --> 01:19:45.224
As I think I have explained
to you many times before,

01:19:45.225 --> 01:19:48.024
romantic entanglement,
while fulfilling for other people...

01:19:48.025 --> 01:19:50.744
- Would complete you as a human being.
- That doesn't even mean anything.

01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:51.944
Just text her, phone her,

01:19:51.945 --> 01:19:53.704
do something while
there's still a chance,

01:19:53.705 --> 01:19:55.464
because that chance doesn't last forever.

01:19:55.465 --> 01:19:57.744
Trust me, Sherlock,
it's gone before you know it.

01:19:57.745 --> 01:19:59.449
Before you know it!

01:20:06.345 --> 01:20:08.024
She was wrong about me.

01:20:08.025 --> 01:20:09.065
Mary? How so?

01:20:11.505 --> 01:20:13.704
She thought that if you
put yourself in harm's way,

01:20:13.705 --> 01:20:16.704
I'd... I'd rescue you, or something.

01:20:16.705 --> 01:20:18.865
But I didn't, not till she told me to.

01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:22.384
And that's how this works,
that's what you're missing.

01:20:22.385 --> 01:20:24.904
She taught me to be the man
she already thought I was.

01:20:24.905 --> 01:20:26.264
Get yourself a piece of that.

01:20:26.265 --> 01:20:28.384
Forgive me, but you are
doing yourself a disservice.

01:20:28.385 --> 01:20:30.864
I have known many people in this world,
but made few friends,

01:20:30.865 --> 01:20:32.945
and I can safely say... I cheated on her.

01:20:36.425 --> 01:20:37.704
No clever comeback?

01:20:37.705 --> 01:20:39.025
I cheated on you, Mary.

01:20:41.505 --> 01:20:43.264
There was a woman on the bus,

01:20:43.265 --> 01:20:45.264
and I had a plastic daisy in my hair,

01:20:45.265 --> 01:20:46.745
I'd been playing with Rosie.

01:20:49.425 --> 01:20:51.145
And this girl just smiled at me.

01:20:52.691 --> 01:20:54.331
That's all it was, it was a smile.

01:20:55.625 --> 01:20:57.504
We texted, constantly.

01:20:57.505 --> 01:20:58.664
You want to know when?

01:20:58.665 --> 01:21:00.704
Every time you left the room, that's when.

01:21:00.705 --> 01:21:02.504
When you were feeding our daughter.

01:21:02.505 --> 01:21:05.345
When you were stopping her
from crying, that's when.

01:21:09.705 --> 01:21:11.065
And that's all it was.

01:21:12.145 --> 01:21:13.665
Just texting.

01:21:14.865 --> 01:21:16.065
But I wanted more.

01:21:17.865 --> 01:21:20.385
And do you know something? I still do.

01:21:21.665 --> 01:21:24.224
I'm not the man you thought I was,
I'm not that guy.

01:21:24.225 --> 01:21:25.744
I never could be.

01:21:25.745 --> 01:21:27.065
But that's the point.

01:21:30.814 --> 01:21:32.854
That's the whole point.

01:21:36.505 --> 01:21:38.225
Who you thought I was...

01:21:40.425 --> 01:21:42.065
...is the man who I want to be.

01:21:45.379 --> 01:21:46.419
Well, then...

01:21:48.585 --> 01:21:50.185
...John Watson...

01:21:56.282 --> 01:21:57.882
...get the hell on with it.

01:22:16.345 --> 01:22:18.985
- It's OK.
- It's not OK.

01:22:21.167 --> 01:22:22.207
No...

01:22:24.225 --> 01:22:25.665
...but it is what it is.

01:22:33.606 --> 01:22:36.904
So, Molly's going to meet
us at this cake place.

01:22:36.905 --> 01:22:39.424
Well, it's your birthday.
Cake is obligatory.

01:22:39.425 --> 01:22:42.664
Oh, well, I suppose a sugar
high is some sort of substitute.

01:22:42.665 --> 01:22:44.064
Behave.

01:22:44.065 --> 01:22:46.904
Right then.
You know, it's not my place to say,

01:22:46.905 --> 01:22:49.785
but... it was just texting.

01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:56.184
People text. Even I text.
Her, I mean. Woman. Bad idea.

01:22:56.185 --> 01:22:58.265
Try not to, but, you know, sometimes...

01:22:59.665 --> 01:23:01.664
It's not a pleasant thought, John,

01:23:01.665 --> 01:23:03.984
but I have this terrible
feeling from time to time

01:23:03.985 --> 01:23:06.384
that we might all just be human.

01:23:06.385 --> 01:23:08.105
- Even you?
- No.

01:23:09.505 --> 01:23:10.585
Even you.

01:23:14.025 --> 01:23:17.824
- Cake?
- Cake! Oh, um...

01:23:17.825 --> 01:23:19.984
What? What is it?

01:23:19.985 --> 01:23:21.025
What's wrong?

01:23:23.305 --> 01:23:25.144
Seriously?

01:23:25.145 --> 01:23:26.945
I'm Sherlock Holmes, I wear the damn hat!

01:23:29.985 --> 01:23:31.425
Isn't that right, Mary?

01:23:41.705 --> 01:23:44.384
You seem so much better, John.

01:23:44.385 --> 01:23:47.544
Yeah, I... I am. I think I am.

01:23:47.545 --> 01:23:51.064
Not all day, not every
day, but, you know.

01:23:51.065 --> 01:23:53.248
- It is what it is?
- Yeah.

01:23:54.985 --> 01:23:56.304
And Rosie?

01:23:56.305 --> 01:23:57.784
Beautiful, perfect.

01:23:57.785 --> 01:24:01.064
Unprecedented in the history of children.

01:24:01.065 --> 01:24:03.944
That's not my bias,
that's scientific fact.

01:24:03.945 --> 01:24:06.824
- Good. And Sherlock Holmes?
- Back to normal.

01:24:06.825 --> 01:24:07.984
'Get out!'

01:24:07.985 --> 01:24:09.304
She's possessed by the devil!

01:24:09.305 --> 01:24:11.304
I swear, my wife is channelling Satan!

01:24:11.305 --> 01:24:13.024
Yes, boring, go away!

01:24:13.025 --> 01:24:14.864
I'm not channelling Satan!

01:24:14.865 --> 01:24:16.985
Why not, given your
immediately alternative?

01:24:25.865 --> 01:24:28.704
- What about his brother?
- Mycroft? He's fine.

01:24:28.705 --> 01:24:32.504
So, you're off now.
I won't see you for a week?

01:24:32.505 --> 01:24:36.745
Just spending it at home.
Unless she calls. The PM.

01:24:38.705 --> 01:24:40.744
Here. What's this?

01:24:40.745 --> 01:24:43.304
- My number.
- I already have your number.

01:24:43.305 --> 01:24:46.024
- My private number.
- Why would I need that?

01:24:46.025 --> 01:24:49.464
I don't know. Maybe
you'd like a drink sometime.

01:24:49.465 --> 01:24:53.464
- Of... what?
- Up to you.

01:24:53.465 --> 01:24:55.145
Call me.

01:25:06.905 --> 01:25:09.384
I mean, obviously, "normal" and "fine"

01:25:09.385 --> 01:25:12.064
are both relative terms when it
comes to Sherlock and Mycroft.

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:13.905
Obviously.

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:24.065
She was real.

01:25:31.105 --> 01:25:33.064
'But I didn't mean Mycroft.'

01:25:33.065 --> 01:25:35.264
I meant the other one.

01:25:35.265 --> 01:25:38.184
Which other one? You know, the secret one.

01:25:38.185 --> 01:25:40.904
Oh, that was just something I said.

01:25:40.905 --> 01:25:42.065
I'm sure there's...

01:25:46.065 --> 01:25:48.424
How did you know about that?
I didn't tell you that.

01:25:48.425 --> 01:25:50.584
- You must have done.
- I really didn't.

01:25:50.585 --> 01:25:53.304
Well, maybe Sherlock told me.

01:25:53.305 --> 01:25:57.304
But you've met Sherlock
exactly once, in this room,

01:25:57.305 --> 01:25:58.624
he was off his head.

01:25:58.625 --> 01:26:01.544
Oh, no, no, I met him before that.

01:26:01.545 --> 01:26:02.864
When?

01:26:02.865 --> 01:26:06.784
We spent a night together. It was lovely.

01:26:06.785 --> 01:26:08.585
We had chips.

01:26:14.425 --> 01:26:17.265
"You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes."

01:26:18.345 --> 01:26:22.048
"You're... nicer."

01:26:33.665 --> 01:26:36.944
Culverton gave me Faith's original note.

01:26:36.945 --> 01:26:39.622
A mutual friend put us in touch.

01:26:40.505 --> 01:26:43.904
Did Sherlock ever
tell you about the note?

01:26:43.905 --> 01:26:46.584
I added some deductions for Sherlock.

01:26:46.585 --> 01:26:49.043
He was quite good.

01:26:50.225 --> 01:26:53.730
But... he didn't get the big one.

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.816
_

01:27:05.705 --> 01:27:10.064
In fairness, though, he does
have excellent taste in chips.

01:27:10.065 --> 01:27:11.624
- What's that?
- What's what?

01:27:11.625 --> 01:27:13.624
The flower in your hair,
it's like I had on the bus.

01:27:13.625 --> 01:27:16.224
You looked very sweet.

01:27:16.225 --> 01:27:17.465
But then...

01:27:20.105 --> 01:27:22.904
"You have such nice eyes."

01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:26.224
Amazing the times a man doesn't
really look at your face.

01:27:26.225 --> 01:27:30.664
Oh, you can hide behind a
sexy smile or a walking cane,

01:27:30.665 --> 01:27:32.784
or just be a therapist,

01:27:32.785 --> 01:27:37.304
talking about you... all the time.

01:27:37.305 --> 01:27:38.824
Oh, please don't go anywhere,

01:27:38.825 --> 01:27:40.824
I'm sure the therapist
who actually lives here

01:27:40.825 --> 01:27:42.344
wouldn't want blood on the carpet.

01:27:42.345 --> 01:27:44.384
Oh, hang on, it's fine.

01:27:44.385 --> 01:27:46.144
She's in a sack in the airing cupboard.

01:27:46.145 --> 01:27:48.345
- Who are you?
- Isn't it obvious?

01:27:50.825 --> 01:27:52.544
Haven't you guessed?

01:27:52.545 --> 01:27:53.944
I'm Eurus.

01:27:53.945 --> 01:27:55.384
Eurus?

01:27:55.385 --> 01:27:59.984
Silly name, isn't it? Greek.
Means "the east wind".

01:27:59.985 --> 01:28:02.224
My parents loved silly names,

01:28:02.225 --> 01:28:04.744
like Eurus...

01:28:04.745 --> 01:28:06.984
or Mycroft...

01:28:06.985 --> 01:28:09.031
or Sherlock.

01:28:09.056 --> 01:28:10.824
Oh, look at him.

01:28:10.825 --> 01:28:12.984
Didn't it ever occur
to you, not even once,

01:28:12.985 --> 01:28:17.065
that Sherlock's secret brother might
just be Sherlock's secret sister?

01:28:18.745 --> 01:28:19.945
Huh?

01:28:21.065 --> 01:28:22.985
He's making a funny face.

01:28:25.065 --> 01:28:26.665
I think I'll put a hole in it.
