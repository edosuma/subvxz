00:00.080 --> 00:01.270
- Emmy, is it?
- Effy.

00:01.390 --> 00:02.160
You're a fucking assistant.

00:02.320 --> 00:03.950
Money, show me.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.800
- Do you have enough money to pay the rent?
- Potentially.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.320
I think I'm going to be
a stand-up comedian.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.440
Fucking dyke.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.320
You know something, don't you?

00:14.440 --> 00:16.800
I would like to buy 300,000 shares
in Grey Levenson.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.440
What the fuck are you doing?

00:18.600 --> 00:20.920
- How much did you make for us today?
- 1.2 million.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.230
I've got fucking cancer!

00:23.880 --> 00:27.618

00:28.240 --> 00:29.720
All...

00:29.840 --> 00:32.200
...the wonderful things
that London has to offer,

00:32.320 --> 00:34.400
and you all chose to come
to this shit-hole?

00:36.760 --> 00:39.840
But, look, we've all come
dressed in the same hipster uniform

00:39.960 --> 00:41.960
so as not to feel suicidally alone.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.880
You, man. You've got it down.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.680
Lovely trilby, lovely skinny jeans.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.005
I bet you're thinking,

00:50.125 --> 00:53.200
"My bollocks are fucking squashed,
yeah, but I feel cool."

00:53.320 --> 00:55.880
"I feel cool."

00:56.120 --> 00:57.600
See, you're all right as a bloke.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.480
If you put on the right clothes,
you're fine, you're golden, right?

01:01.600 --> 01:03.920
Not so much for us ladies.

01:04.040 --> 01:08.120
No, we've created a whole other set
of rules to judge each other by.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.280
See, now, I'm a feminist.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.040
I go full bush. Yeah?

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm against the hairless ideals
put upon us by the media

01:21.120 --> 01:24.040
and, um... porn.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.000
Um... but all that's
kind of changed recently,

01:29.120 --> 01:32.600
because, actually,
got a bit of the old cancer.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.440
Yes, I said cancer.
But don't worry, I'm fine.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.720
Cancer's not the point.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.840
The point is the targeted
radiotherapy...

01:43.560 --> 01:47.560
... which has actually made me
completely fucking bald...

01:49.320 --> 01:51.760
...you know, down, down in
dispatch.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.898
And I don't know if this is a massive
"fuck you" to my feminist values,

01:55.018 --> 01:55.960
but I'm just gonna say it.

01:56.080 --> 01:59.160
I feel really successful.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.480
I feel like Rihanna
but without the bruises.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.240
Um...

02:05.360 --> 02:07.680
I mean, it's like bald vag
equals opportunity.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.789
My snatch has just been offered,
you know,

02:09.910 --> 02:13.137
a three-album contract
and a perfume deal so...

02:29.960 --> 02:32.160
I can't keep sitting
through this comedy shit.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.440
I mean, it's great that she's doing
well,

02:34.560 --> 02:36.640
but she's not paid her rent
for three months now.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.400
Three fucking months.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.600
Are you allowed to ask someone who's
got cancer if they can pay the rent?

02:41.720 --> 02:44.600
Seriously, it would all
be fine if they just paid her.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.040
Why does no-one get paid?

02:46.160 --> 02:47.600
No!

02:47.720 --> 02:49.480
Listen to me. I'm angry.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.280
- Shut up...
- OK.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.120
..and come with me.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.720
- OK.
- Aah! Fuck!

02:55.840 --> 02:58.755
Right, that's it. You're getting it.
You're getting it.

02:58.875 --> 02:59.680
Ow!

03:00.480 --> 03:01.960
Rich?

03:02.080 --> 03:06.600
Yeah. Well, it's three in the
fucking morning. What do you expect?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.667
OK, but we said 500 at 90.

03:08.787 --> 03:10.240
<i>Well, no-one's going
to buy it at this price.</i>

03:10.360 --> 03:13.862
- There'll be buyers, trust me.
- <i>I can give you 400 tomorrow.</i>

03:13.982 --> 03:16.300
No, Rich, we said 500 and you know
it.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.061
<i>400 tomorrow.</i>

03:19.240 --> 03:22.240
- It needs to happen now.
- <i>I'll do my best.</i>

03:24.120 --> 03:25.920
- OK, look, can I call you back?
- <i>Cool.</i>

03:26.040 --> 03:28.320
Yeah, fine. Bye.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.920
Come back to bed.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.040
I've got to trade these fucking
piece-of-shit futures before the...

03:35.880 --> 03:38.760
Oh, it's just all day, you know,
I just can't seem to get ahead.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's putting me on edge.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.280
You need to come back to bed.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.520
OK.

03:49.640 --> 03:53.640
Mm.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.680
No, I haven't spoken to him yet.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.360
He told me he wasn't
moving till tomorrow.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.690
- Hey, do you know Tom Chittock's number?
- No, sorry.

04:08.810 --> 04:11.060
John, sorry, we just don't have it.

04:20.207 --> 04:22.120
What's up with you at the moment?

04:22.280 --> 04:23.720
Morning to you too, Mark.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.160
You've got half of last month's
trades in future strategy.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.880
It doesn't make any sense.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.120
Fuck. Sorry. I must have
got the folders confused.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.576
Yeah, so stop coasting. Sort it now.

05:36.040 --> 05:39.520
- Whoo!
- Oh, my God!

05:39.640 --> 05:41.280
- Emily.
- Hi.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.560
- What are you doing here?
- She didn't tell me either.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.880
Yeah, well, I got a few days off
and I thought I'd surprise you.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.720
- That's great. Did Naomi ring you or...?
- Oh, my God.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.880
You look like a sexy funeral
director or something.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.000
Thank you. It's just for work.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.720
Yeah, I wanna hear about it.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.520
You're gonna have to listen to me bang
on about New York. She's already bored.

06:01.540 --> 06:02.840
Let me get a drink first.

06:06.812 --> 06:09.360
These are really, really good.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.440
I'm actually very proud of you.

06:15.146 --> 06:18.089
- So, where does Emily think you are?
- Comedy workshop.

06:20.996 --> 06:23.080
You could use actual words, you know.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.600
Fine. This is fucked up.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.440
If she finds out now, she'll go
mental and drop out of her internship.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.800
She worked her tits off
to get it in the first place,

06:33.920 --> 06:36.280
and I'm not gonna be
the reason she loses it.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.457
She deserves to know what's going on.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.400
-Did you just hear what I said?
She will know.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.040
Just as soon as this is all over,
which it will be soon, OK?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.964
- Miss Campbell?
- Stay here.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.280
Do you want your friend
to come with you to the scan?

06:55.708 --> 06:58.080
If you could lie down
on the board now, Naomi.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.248
You can stand over there.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.622
You all right?

07:03.919 --> 07:05.906
I'm going to start it up now, Naomi.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.080
Nice and still, please.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.080
Put your hands in tight, please.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.800
Let go, Naomi. Naomi,
you need to let go of my hand.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.240
- Ef?
- It's fine. It's fine. You're OK.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.210
Don't speak, please.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.560
Surprise.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.040
What are you doing here?

08:04.160 --> 08:06.080
Well, you told me your friends
wanted to meet me.

08:06.200 --> 08:10.200
I didn't think you'd actually come.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.560
So, wait, they sent you
to boarding school at six?

08:20.720 --> 08:23.040
- Yep.
- Jesus.

08:23.160 --> 08:27.160
So, boarding school, to Oxbridge,
to a million pound bonus in the City.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.120
It's not always a million.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.780
- Oh, not always?
- Ah, good.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.559
Well, that's all right, then.
Keeping it real.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.061
So, just because
Jake doesn't lounge about all day,

08:38.181 --> 08:40.000
being an unemployed comedian,
not paying rent,

08:40.120 --> 08:44.120
means he doesn't live in the real
world?

08:44.840 --> 08:47.360
Well, you're such a shining example.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.693
I mean, we really look up to her,
don't we, Ems?

08:49.813 --> 08:51.920
- Oh, we idolise her.
- So you should.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.960
I'd like to propose a toast.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.080
To Effy, the most fucking together
person I've ever met.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.320
Cheers.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.880
Oh, yeah, she's always been
like that. Haven't you, Ef?

09:07.040 --> 09:09.520
Don't be mean.
She's a good girl now.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.760
Oh, Ef, don't be a fanny.
We're just playing.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.480
It's fine.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.800
You're just twatted. As per.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.000
I'm going to bed.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.760
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

09:34.968 --> 09:36.840
Is she all right?

09:36.960 --> 09:39.760
She's fine.
She's always stressed these days.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.760
Never get a job in the City.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.480
Sorry.

09:58.414 --> 10:00.024
It's a bit distracting.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.400
- Are they always like this?
- Every night.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.640
It's just a bit off-putting.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.000
It's not just them, though, is it?

10:14.120 --> 10:17.520
I can't remember
the figures ever being this low.

10:18.055 --> 10:20.680
I literally have nothing
to tell the investors.

10:21.529 --> 10:23.229
It's just the recession.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.560
I need another big win.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.800
I need an Effy special.

10:33.725 --> 10:36.680
It was just luck last time.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.040
Come on.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.120
You're brilliant.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.681
- No.
- Yes.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.114
- Yes.
- No, you don't get it.

10:48.661 --> 10:49.961
I had some help.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.824
OK.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.820
There's nothing wrong with that.

11:05.354 --> 11:09.417
Some more of that
would be good right now.

11:11.854 --> 11:13.560
Could you make that happen?

12:07.320 --> 12:09.520
Bye.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.593
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.600
Why are you doing this?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.000
Because I love her.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.570
Then why won't you tell her
the truth?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.840
Because she matters more to me
than the truth does.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.980
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.280
Angry man approaching.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.320
Mark, I'm coming.
I'm just making a coffee.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.716
The trading sheets you were supposed to redo
after your first fuck-up are still fucked.

13:00.836 --> 13:02.000
I looked through everything.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.920
You know, maybe if you took
the boss's dick out of your mouth

13:04.040 --> 13:05.840
for more than five minutes
of the day,

13:05.960 --> 13:08.120
you might have some time
to concentrate on your actual fucking job.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.680
- Fuck you, Mark.
- Oh, no, that wouldn't work, would it?

13:10.840 --> 13:12.400
Because if his dick wasn't in your
mouth,

13:12.520 --> 13:14.633
you wouldn't be in this job
in the first place, would you?

13:16.880 --> 13:19.640
That was so totally out of order.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.442
- Jane?
- Yeah?

13:21.562 --> 13:22.862
Please fuck off.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.112
No.

13:44.584 --> 13:45.584
OK.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.370
I really, really can't.

13:49.009 --> 13:50.259
I said OK, Dom.

13:51.536 --> 13:55.372
I mean, from where I'm sitting,
you seem to be doing pretty good as you are.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.480
Truth is, it's all gone tits up.
Really, really bad.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.709
Jake's cutting himself up about it.

14:03.472 --> 14:05.598
Oh, Jake's cut up, is he?

14:06.920 --> 14:07.920
Poor Jake.

14:08.369 --> 14:11.199
Yeah, he is. He's really worried.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.593
He asked me to help him.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.800
Why do you like him? Like,
seriously, why do you like him?

14:23.032 --> 14:25.532
He makes me feel like
I'm good at this.

14:27.964 --> 14:29.040
I'm such an idiot.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.960
I managed to convince myself
that you weren't shagging him.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.240
Dom, that's not the point.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.005
It is. It is, though, isn't it?
Obviously.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.200
Because I'm pathetically in love
with you.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.000
As you know.
It's just a crush, you twat.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.215
A crush? Oh, my God.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.280
OK, fine, cool. That's cool.
Yeah, crush. OK.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.800
I mean, that would have been lovely,

14:48.920 --> 14:51.400
if you would have completely ignored
me for a couple of years.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.800
I might have forgotten about it.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.520
But, no, you had to make friends
with me,

14:54.640 --> 14:56.840
get me addicted to fags,
this smoking spot.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.760
You asked me to break the law
for multi-million-pound scams.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.480
I... I think...
I think you should leave me alone.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.160
I really do, for a bit,

15:07.280 --> 15:09.840
and not come to this smoking spot
any more.

15:21.680 --> 15:25.680
I think you'll find
this is my smoking spot.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.880
Hey, I thought I was late.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.800
You are.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.520
Naomi? Come on.
Glad to see you.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
Yes. Good.

15:56.216 --> 16:00.280
It looks as though the radiotherapy
hasn't done what we wanted.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.240
It was a little speculative, in any
case, trying to shrink and...

16:03.360 --> 16:06.360
Well, great. Wonderful!

16:06.480 --> 16:08.960
What the fuck do we do next?

16:09.080 --> 16:10.960
We proceed to the chemotherapy.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.640
I think we did discuss this.

16:13.760 --> 16:18.240
No. No, you said it was a
possibility. A possibility!

16:18.400 --> 16:22.080
Well, yes, I think sometimes
we use words which are...

16:23.280 --> 16:26.320
... which are less exact, because it's
hard to take in everything at once.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.160
What the fuck?
You said it was a possibility!

16:29.280 --> 16:31.280
I'm sorry.
Now we have to go on to the chemo.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.800
It's a much more resolute treatment.
It can help you defeat this.

16:34.977 --> 16:36.720
I'm very optimistic.

16:40.584 --> 16:43.099
- When?
- Tomorrow, ideally.

16:43.932 --> 16:45.232
We should start.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.070
Come on, then.

16:48.070 --> 16:50.680
- What?
- This is where you will reassure me.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.520
- Fucking hell.
- It'll be fine. He's really good.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.000
Yeah, thanks. You've put my mind at
rest. Thank fuck!

16:56.120 --> 16:58.400
Naomi. Stop.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.720
We're going this way. Taking my car.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.390
You don't have a car.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.000
Hi. For you.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.360
- Ah, aren't you sweet?
- How were the results?

17:36.200 --> 17:39.640
- Chemo tomorrow.
- I'm so sorry.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.400
It'll be worth it. I know it doesn't
make it any less shit, but...

17:44.232 --> 17:46.182
See? That's how you do it.

17:50.080 --> 17:53.400
- What did you say to her?
- I'm doing my best, Dom.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.640
<i>We are talking about normal use.</i>

17:57.760 --> 18:01.760
<i>So, do you guys know what
normally will cause a condom to...</i>

18:02.400 --> 18:03.440
Eurgh!

18:03.880 --> 18:05.360
- <i>...malfunction?</i>
- I gotta go.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.840
<i>Friction?</i>

18:06.960 --> 18:10.640
Oh, well, feel free to come round
whenever you want.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.760
Right, er... yeah. Yeah, cheers.
I will. Yeah, cool.

18:21.261 --> 18:22.632
What's that?

18:24.444 --> 18:26.733
Something's happening tomorrow.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.800
See you.

18:28.920 --> 18:29.920
Cheerio.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.760
I thought with all the environmental
crazies protesting, it was a no-go.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.160
Shale gas is like
fucking reputation cancer.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.280
Which is why the company's share prices
have been dropping in the last few months.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.600
When is he making the announcement?

19:01.720 --> 19:04.840
Tomorrow.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.960
Well, then, we have to buy it.
We have to buy it all.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.120
- How large is your portfolio?
- Ten million.

19:12.240 --> 19:16.240
It's not enough.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.440
- Do you know Mark's password?
- They reset them last week.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.371
It'll be his surname.

19:29.087 --> 19:33.640
Bingo. Go, Effy!

19:38.880 --> 19:41.520
Ah, this is good.

19:41.640 --> 19:45.040
This is very, very good.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.040
Hello...

20:20.720 --> 20:21.970
Get on with it.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.200
We are here to celebrate

20:42.320 --> 20:46.240
a characteristically abysmal
performance this quarter.

20:46.360 --> 20:52.444
However, this week we dug ourselves
out of a hole

20:52.564 --> 20:54.880
and we made some fucking money!

21:56.920 --> 22:00.920
Keep your eyes closed.
Come this way a little bit.

22:01.440 --> 22:05.440
Walking, keep walking, keep walking.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.880
Wait there, wait there.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.080
OK, open.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.640
What the hell is this?

22:18.760 --> 22:20.280
Do you like it?

22:20.400 --> 22:22.280
Is this where Patrick Bateman lives?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.680
No, this is our new flat.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.552
The lease isn't up on ours yet.

22:26.672 --> 22:29.498
Yeah, I know. I'm just going to pay
for both for a while.

22:29.618 --> 22:30.360
Why?

22:30.520 --> 22:33.040
I don't know, Naomi.
Thought you might appreciate it.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.880
Thought it might be nice.

22:36.662 --> 22:39.127
- But I like our flat.
- Yeah, well...

22:39.720 --> 22:41.934
I've moved your stuff
into the big bedroom.

22:42.054 --> 22:44.838
Go turn your nose up at that.
It's that way. I'm going out.

22:45.304 --> 22:46.360
Effy...

22:56.297 --> 22:57.297
Great.

23:08.270 --> 23:09.182
Effy Stonem.

23:09.302 --> 23:10.437
<i>Elizabeth Stonem?</i>

23:10.557 --> 23:13.024
- Speaking.
- <i>Yes, good morning.</i>

23:13.144 --> 23:16.102
<i>I'm calling to check your
availability for a meeting tomorrow</i>

23:16.222 --> 23:17.080
<i>at the FSA.</i>

23:17.200 --> 23:18.854
A meeting with who, sorry?

23:18.974 --> 23:21.160
<i>The FSA.
The Financial Services Authority.</i>

23:22.473 --> 23:24.763
<i>We have some questions
we would like you to answer.</i>

23:24.883 --> 23:26.393
<i>I'm calling for your availability.</i>

23:27.865 --> 23:30.229
<i>Hello, Miss Stonem?
Miss Stonem, are you there?</i>

23:30.349 --> 23:32.080
Yes. Er... sorry.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.920
- Hey.
- What's up?

23:35.040 --> 23:39.863
I had a call from the FSA.
They want me to go in for a meeting.

23:39.983 --> 23:44.206
OK.
What exactly did they say?

23:44.326 --> 23:47.720
Nothing. They just told me
I need to go in tomorrow.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.440
Jake, I... I need you to tell me that
this isn't as bad as I think it is.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.640
Seriously, I need you
to tell me this is fine.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.720
It's fine. It's fine.
They have nothing.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.040
Well, they obviously have something
or they wouldn't be calling me in.

23:59.470 --> 24:01.923
No, you tell them nothing.

24:02.225 --> 24:03.760
Understand?

24:06.920 --> 24:08.400
Look.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.400
If I mean anything to you...

24:12.136 --> 24:17.240
OK? If we mean anything,
you'll do exactly as I say.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.720
You deny everything...

24:20.191 --> 24:21.839
... and everything goes on.

24:23.733 --> 24:24.640
OK?

24:24.760 --> 24:26.000
OK.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.240
OK.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.120
Naomi.

24:40.065 --> 24:41.537
It's just me.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.080
Naoms, where are you?

24:55.720 --> 24:57.000
Naoms?

24:57.120 --> 24:58.800
Ef?

24:58.920 --> 25:01.040
Can't stop puking.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.800
Oh, my God.

25:04.776 --> 25:06.203
Oh, my God. You're so hot.

25:06.323 --> 25:08.494
Fuck. Right, let's get you up, then.

25:08.614 --> 25:11.920
It's been like this all day.
I didn't know if you were coming.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.000
I'm sorry. Oh, my God, you're so hot.

25:16.957 --> 25:18.962
It won't fucking stop!

25:22.400 --> 25:24.000
OK.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.800
I didn't know who else to ring.
She won't let me take her into hospital.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.531
No, it's OK. It's good you called.

25:30.651 --> 25:33.204
- Hi.
- Sorry, Dom.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.000
No, shh. Don't worry.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.086
Ef, put the shower on.
Let's get you cooled down.

25:38.206 --> 25:40.040
One... one minute.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.550
OK, one, two, three.

25:42.670 --> 25:43.960
There we go.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.875
Ah, sluice the puke off me.
The romance.

25:47.995 --> 25:49.880
Would you like me to get naked too,
for solidarity?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.720
- Nah, you're all right, Dom.
- It's your loss.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.707
You got any drugs? Legal ones.

25:54.736 --> 25:58.080
- No.
- Go and fucking get some. Go.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.440
She's cooler.

26:12.560 --> 26:13.800
That's good.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.760
I'll sleep on the sofa and hang out
here tomorrow if you're working.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.120
They won't miss me.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.520
I've just got a meeting
in the morning.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.360
No problem.

26:24.744 --> 26:25.744
Thank you.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.464
Hope you know what you're doing
with that boy.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.920
Call her.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.840
No.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.310
Fucking call her.

26:51.760 --> 26:52.760
Not yet.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.560
Elizabeth Stonem?

28:05.680 --> 28:06.720
Yes.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.651
This way, please.

28:20.311 --> 28:21.971
Thank you, Clare.

28:24.520 --> 28:27.320
Effy. You look well.

28:27.760 --> 28:31.440
So do you, Victoria.
You've gone all gamekeeper.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.680
Yeah, it's quite funny.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.640
I think they like me to draw
on my experience with the poachers,

28:37.760 --> 28:39.000
like you.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.800
You know I'm just a trader.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.120
I think you're a little
more than that.

28:44.749 --> 28:46.240
You going to tell me
what this is about?

28:46.360 --> 28:47.800
We're getting around to it.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.800
Well, get around to it quicker.
You're boring me.

28:51.960 --> 28:56.200
I know what you've been doing, Effy.
I'm sure it was just to get ahead.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.331
I don't know what impression
you've got, but...

28:58.451 --> 29:00.243
Well, let's call it an impression
that you've been using

29:00.363 --> 29:03.015
illegally obtained information
to create trading profits.

29:03.135 --> 29:06.306
About 11 million pounds' worth,
to be precise.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.360
I don't know if this is some sort
of "putting me in my place" exercise,

29:12.480 --> 29:13.800
but it's a bit fucking extreme.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.360
We're all ambitious, Effy,

29:15.480 --> 29:17.440
but sometimes we have
to check in with ourselves

29:17.560 --> 29:19.080
to make sure that we're not
going over the line.

29:21.280 --> 29:24.360
It's not my fault he didn't want you.

29:26.159 --> 29:28.280
It's not a crime to sleep
with your boss.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.559
It's pretty fucking stupid,

29:30.679 --> 29:32.080
but we're both pathetic
when it comes to that.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.720
You're just trying to fuck him over.

29:34.880 --> 29:35.960
I don't need to.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.480
I didn't illegally create
11 million pounds of profits

29:38.640 --> 29:39.840
through insider trading.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.790
He's fucking himself over.
And you. Don't you get it?

29:45.040 --> 29:47.440
- We need to carry on.
- You carry on.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.058
- Give him up, Effy!
- Fuck you.

30:03.120 --> 30:06.000
<i>You have one new message.</i>

30:06.120 --> 30:08.560
<i>Ef, it's me.
Um... I'm going to take Naomi in.</i>

30:08.680 --> 30:10.360
<i>She's... she's OK.
She's still puking.</i>

30:10.480 --> 30:11.880
<i>I think she should be looked over.</i>

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
<i>We'll be at the Royal if you can
get away from work, OK? OK, bye.</i>

30:32.520 --> 30:33.520
Hi.

30:35.551 --> 30:37.960
- What's going on?
- It's not great news.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.880
But you feel better, right?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.480
No, the treatment's not working, Ef.

30:44.426 --> 30:46.320
Well, then, she needs another
treatment.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.628
No, that's not it.

30:53.724 --> 30:54.724
Naoms?

31:00.720 --> 31:04.720
You're supposed to make me comfortable.

31:09.603 --> 31:10.953
And it's snowing.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.120
I've got something to tell you.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.560
I had a meeting with the FSA today.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.720
They called me in because
they're investigating my profits.

31:45.670 --> 31:48.840
I think they might be coming
to you next.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.677
What the fuck is wrong with you?

31:52.287 --> 31:55.440
They know, Dom.
They know I've done something.

31:56.920 --> 32:00.089
She's alone in there, and all...

32:00.209 --> 32:02.160
You know what? Fuck it. Fuck this.

32:21.599 --> 32:22.599
Naomi?

32:32.895 --> 32:34.880
Naomi?

33:09.920 --> 33:11.880
What are you doing out here?

33:12.320 --> 33:13.920
It's fucking freezing.

33:17.120 --> 33:21.850
I promised Emily once that I would
never, ever hurt her again.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.080
Yeah, I know.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.240
And when the New York job came up,

33:28.079 --> 33:29.880
it didn't even seem like
that big a deal,

33:30.000 --> 33:33.572
because... we're Naomi and Emily.

33:35.109 --> 33:38.920
It didn't matter,
because we love each other.

33:40.792 --> 33:42.704
And now...

33:45.215 --> 33:52.208
...now I have to hurt her so much
that it might never be OK again.

33:56.388 --> 34:00.960
Stop talking like a dick.
It's not going to be like that.

34:03.370 --> 34:05.533
It's OK. I get it.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.103
But Emily...

34:08.928 --> 34:11.795
This isn't fair!

34:11.916 --> 34:12.916
Stop it.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.400
You've just been outside too long.

34:16.612 --> 34:19.862
Come on, let's get back inside.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.520
Dom?

35:02.640 --> 35:04.480
What are you doing here?

35:04.600 --> 35:08.600
I've been, er... walking around,
erm... trying not to come here.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.560
- Let me take your coat off...
- No, fuck off!

35:11.680 --> 35:13.281
Get off me. OK?

35:14.600 --> 35:17.942
You know, they took my computer.
They've taken it.

35:18.062 --> 35:20.760
Look, it... it's fine.
They can't prove you did anything.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.640
- You're working yourself up over nothing.
- No, I'm not.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.920
Because I am going to go
to prison, you bitch!

35:26.315 --> 35:28.600
Stop pretending
like this isn't happening.

35:28.839 --> 35:30.280
I'm sorry.
Do you know the worst thing?

35:30.624 --> 35:33.000
The worst thing is, is I deserve it.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.640
I do, because I was fine.

35:34.760 --> 35:38.760
Before you I was fine,
and now I'm fucking pathetic!

35:41.549 --> 35:44.120
- Dom, wait.
- No, fuck off! OK? Fuck off.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.000
I didn't mean for any of this
to happen!

35:46.120 --> 35:48.246
OK, that's it. That's it done.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

35:48.366 --> 35:49.976
That's it. Fuck you.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.880
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.840
It's fine, it's fine.
It was... it was me.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.120
No. I'm sorry.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.882
I'm really... Fuck! Fuck!

36:57.710 --> 37:00.377
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.720
Effy, this is Mr Jessup.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.964
Mr Jessup is head
of the Legal Department.

37:08.084 --> 37:10.680
He's here to talk to us
about the FSA investigation.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.830
Have a seat, Miss Stonem.

37:25.880 --> 37:26.880
Page five.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.006
The trades that occurred
between those two dates

37:32.126 --> 37:34.585
are the ones the FSA
seem to be most interested in.

37:35.680 --> 37:38.000
Do you recognise them, Miss Stonem?

37:39.688 --> 37:40.574
I don't know.

37:40.694 --> 37:43.764
Point being, their evidence
of insider trading is pretty strong.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.878
Looks like they've found a source.

37:45.998 --> 37:50.345
Now, my guess is that you acted
alone, Miss Stonem.

37:50.465 --> 37:53.689
You took a chance in order to improve your
reputation in the company, and it backfired.

37:53.809 --> 37:54.640
No.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.240
Mr Abassi? Do you believe
there to be any company involvement

37:57.360 --> 37:58.810
beyond Miss Stonem?

38:00.131 --> 38:00.880
No.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.040
There was no other involvement.

38:06.875 --> 38:09.826
In that case, I would recommend
Miss Stonem's immediate suspension

38:09.946 --> 38:13.234
whilst her portfolio and records
are prepared for the FSA.

38:13.354 --> 38:16.880
Miss Stonem, I would highly
recommend you find yourself

38:17.000 --> 38:18.200
a good lawyer.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.040
Morning, Jake.

38:25.750 --> 38:28.720
- Why are you doing this?
- Sorry. I have no choice.

38:28.880 --> 38:31.556
Look at me.
Turn around and look at me!

38:37.000 --> 38:39.604
I'm so, so sorry.

39:09.291 --> 39:10.291
Tell me.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.240
Tell you what?

39:14.597 --> 39:17.640
Something. What you're thinking.

39:21.158 --> 39:22.158
Nothing.

39:23.822 --> 39:25.440
I'm not thinking of anything.

39:26.212 --> 39:28.600
I'm fine.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.675
- Fuck off.
- Naomi!

39:30.795 --> 39:33.176
- Get off my bed.
- What have I done?

39:33.296 --> 39:37.794
Nothing. You've done nothing.
That's the whole point.

39:37.914 --> 39:39.800
I've been trying to hold it
all together.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.200
You've been hiding in a fantasy,

39:42.320 --> 39:44.520
and a really fucking lame one
at that.

39:45.034 --> 39:48.120
And I've been
sitting at home on my own,

39:48.240 --> 39:52.480
hoping that my best friend might
just come home and watch TV with me.

39:56.978 --> 40:00.922
Because, seriously, Ef,
what else have we got?

40:15.175 --> 40:17.225
Tell me what we're going to do.

40:20.079 --> 40:21.729
Well, I'm going to die.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.750
What are you going to do?

40:32.741 --> 40:34.720
? Ding, ding, ding, ding
Ding, ding, ding, ding

40:34.840 --> 40:38.360
? Dashing through the snow
in a one-horse open sleigh

40:38.480 --> 40:42.480
? O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

40:42.600 --> 40:46.400
? Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright

40:46.520 --> 40:50.440
? Oh, what fun it is to laugh and
sing a sleighing song tonight

40:50.560 --> 40:54.560
? Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

40:55.000 --> 40:58.160
? Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

40:58.280 --> 41:01.280
♪ Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells...♪

41:01.400 --> 41:03.360
Hey. How are you?

41:03.480 --> 41:06.120
? Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh...

41:06.240 --> 41:08.680
? Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding

41:08.800 --> 41:11.080
? Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding

41:11.200 --> 41:15.200
? Dashing through the snow
in a one-horse open sleigh

41:15.320 --> 41:17.680
? O'er the fields we go

41:17.800 --> 41:19.680
? Laughing all the way

41:19.800 --> 41:23.640
? Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright

41:23.760 --> 41:27.320
? Oh, what fun it is to laugh
and sing a sleighing song tonight

41:27.440 --> 41:31.440
♪ Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells... ♪

41:44.560 --> 41:46.200
Just stay where you are.

41:46.320 --> 41:50.320
Do you not think that you've already
taken enough away from me as it is?

41:50.640 --> 41:54.640
You... you didn't even
deserve this time with her.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.200
- You stole it from me.
- She wouldn't let me.

41:57.320 --> 42:01.320
I'll never forgive you for that.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.360
Canary Wharf, please.

42:46.280 --> 42:47.920
OK.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.160
I've got a condition.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.400
It's just me, all right?

42:52.800 --> 42:56.560
Please, please don't go after Dom.
He doesn't deserve this.

42:56.720 --> 43:00.000
Dominic's not the important one here.

43:02.720 --> 43:06.720
Look, Jake's a nice man,
but he's weak and he's greedy.

43:14.360 --> 43:17.120
I thought it was real.

43:17.240 --> 43:19.240
So, it was his fault?

43:19.360 --> 43:22.960
You were inexperienced
and he took advantage?

43:23.080 --> 43:27.080
That's shitty.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.600
All right.

43:35.720 --> 43:39.720
All right, you'll make a statement
naming Jake?

43:40.720 --> 43:43.440
Yeah.

43:43.560 --> 43:47.560
You know you'll still go to prison?

43:50.080 --> 43:54.080
I know.

44:07.120 --> 44:11.120
I can't go in.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
I just... I just need some more time.

44:16.880 --> 44:20.840
There isn't any more time, Emily.

44:20.960 --> 44:24.960
I'm so angry with her.

44:26.120 --> 44:30.120
She's dying, Emily.

44:32.760 --> 44:36.760
I know.

44:49.880 --> 44:53.720
Look at me.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.320
Be strong.

44:55.440 --> 44:59.480
You need to be strong for her,
like she was strong for you.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.240
You've just arrived in London,
haven't you?

47:54.360 --> 47:56.120
We should go for a drink.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.160
I didn't mean this to happen.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.200
It's you, isn't it?

48:00.320 --> 48:02.560
I don't know who took this.

48:02.680 --> 48:05.120
I think someone's following me.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.640
He's taking weird photos.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.439
It's here.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.352
This creep's got you.
