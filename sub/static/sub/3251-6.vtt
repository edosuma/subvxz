00:18.349 --> 00:22.189
Walter? Don't you want to go and
play with the other boys and girls?

00:22.190 --> 00:24.788
They're very nice.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.269
I don't need anyone else.

00:27.270 --> 00:30.349
He never talks to anyone.

00:30.350 --> 00:34.629
He's so alone. It's not right.

00:34.630 --> 00:37.630
It's not healthy.

00:43.350 --> 00:46.270
I don't want to talk to them.
They're silly.

00:46.271 --> 00:48.630
They're silly.

00:55.510 --> 00:59.390
Don't talk to them.
They're silly.

01:02.470 --> 01:06.230
Don't need anyone else.

01:11.350 --> 01:13.390
I can help you.

01:16.990 --> 01:17.910
How?

01:43.230 --> 01:46.110
The last of the arrivals
have been sampled.

01:46.111 --> 01:48.629
The great swarm is approaching.

01:48.630 --> 01:52.389
As humanity celebrates,
so shall it end.

01:52.390 --> 01:55.029
Will the final piece be ready?

01:55.030 --> 01:59.309
It's in hand. I serve you in this,
as in everything else.

01:59.310 --> 02:04.189
And do you keep my secrets,
those men who helped us tonight?

02:04.190 --> 02:05.430
It won't be a problem.

02:06.950 --> 02:09.150
I promised to feed them.

02:14.550 --> 02:16.469
Beg pardon, Dr Simeon...

02:16.470 --> 02:19.430
it's been a long day.
I don't see any food here.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.030
I do.

02:22.270 --> 02:25.670
What is this?

02:28.590 --> 02:30.749
I said I'd feed you.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.790
I didn't say who to.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.749
Did you make this snowman? No.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.548
Well, who did?
Cos it wasn't there a second ago.

03:14.549 --> 03:16.510
It just appeared, from nowhere.

03:32.190 --> 03:34.230
Maybe it's snow that fell before.

03:34.231 --> 03:36.989
Maybe it remembers how to make snowmen.

03:36.990 --> 03:39.828
What, snow that can remember?
That's silly.

03:39.829 --> 03:42.950
What's wrong with silly? Nothing.
Still talking to you, ain't I?

03:45.950 --> 03:47.149
What's your name?

03:47.150 --> 03:49.229
Clara.

03:49.230 --> 03:53.029
Nice name, Clara.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.710
You should definitely keep it.

03:56.190 --> 03:57.390
Goodbye!

03:59.790 --> 04:01.229
Oi!

04:01.230 --> 04:04.230
Where are you going? I thought
we were just getting acquainted.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.710
Those were the days.

04:26.670 --> 04:28.990
H'yah!

04:51.470 --> 04:55.630
'How refreshing to see you taking
an interest again. Was she nice?'

04:55.631 --> 04:57.229
I just spoke to her.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.310
'And made your usual impact,
no doubt.'

04:59.311 --> 05:02.709
No, no impact at all.
Those days are over.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.308
'You can't help yourself.'

05:04.309 --> 05:05.948
It's the same story, every time.

05:05.949 --> 05:09.028
And it always begins
with the same two words.

05:09.029 --> 05:12.070
She'll never be able to find me again,
she doesn't even have the name.

05:12.071 --> 05:15.589
Doctor - what two words?

05:15.590 --> 05:17.749
Doctor?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.390
Doctor who?

05:20.712 --> 05:28.712

06:10.550 --> 06:13.029
Good evening, sir.

06:13.030 --> 06:15.029
Pond's frozen over.

06:15.030 --> 06:16.990
Hasn't frozen since the night...

06:16.991 --> 06:21.309
Since the night your children's
governess died, a year ago.

06:21.310 --> 06:24.549
Dr Simeon, sir -
he insisted on waiting.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.748
She drowned in this very pond,
which then froze.

06:27.749 --> 06:31.508
You didn't find her till a month
later, when the ice finally melted.

06:31.509 --> 06:34.550
I recall the incident. It is
the sort of thing one remembers.

06:34.551 --> 06:36.149
The ice remembers too.

06:36.150 --> 06:37.590
Who are you? What do you want here?

06:41.150 --> 06:43.270
The pond is yours, Captain Latimer,

06:43.271 --> 06:48.349
but what is growing inside it,
when it is ready, is ours.

06:48.350 --> 06:49.750
Good evening.

07:02.270 --> 07:06.229
Well, Dr Simeon,
you're out very late tonight.

07:06.230 --> 07:08.548
Almost makes you wonder
what you've been up to.

07:08.549 --> 07:11.748
But then, I have often wondered
about the activities of

07:11.749 --> 07:15.030
Dr Simeon and his exceptionally
secretive Institute.

07:15.031 --> 07:17.789
Well, I am honoured this evening.

07:17.790 --> 07:21.509
The veiled detective
and her fatuous accomplice.

07:21.510 --> 07:22.470
At your service.

07:23.790 --> 07:26.548
You realise Dr Doyle
is almost certainly basing

07:26.549 --> 07:29.308
his fantastical tales
on your own exploits?

07:29.309 --> 07:31.828
With a few choice alterations,
of course.

07:31.829 --> 07:35.270
I doubt the readers of The Strand
magazine would accept

07:35.271 --> 07:39.390
that the great detective is,
in reality...

07:43.590 --> 07:44.789
a woman.

07:44.790 --> 07:47.749
And her suspiciously
intimate companion...

07:47.750 --> 07:50.510
I resent your implication
of impropriety!

07:50.511 --> 07:52.149
We are married.

07:52.150 --> 07:55.189
More than can be said for you,
eh, dear?

07:55.190 --> 08:01.349
Now then - this snow is interesting,
don't you think?

08:01.350 --> 08:05.509
The ice crystals seem to have
a low level telepathic field.

08:05.510 --> 08:08.788
Almost as if it can detect
and respond to the thoughts

08:08.789 --> 08:11.030
and memories of the people around it.

08:11.031 --> 08:14.349
Memory snow. Snow that learns.

08:14.350 --> 08:15.669
How fascinating.

08:15.670 --> 08:17.708
I hope it's listening
to the right people.

08:17.709 --> 08:22.070
It could be a terrible weapon
in the wrong hands, don't you think?

08:22.071 --> 08:24.229
I think winter is coming.

08:24.230 --> 08:27.549
Such a winter as this world
has never known.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.510
The last winter of humankind.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.750
Do you know why
I'm telling you all this?

08:32.751 --> 08:34.589
I am intrigued.

08:34.590 --> 08:38.188
Because there is not a single thing
you can do to stop it.

08:38.188 --> 08:40.668
Perhaps I can't,
but I know a man who can.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.510
I look forward to meeting him.

08:44.110 --> 08:45.949
Do you mean the Doctor?

08:45.950 --> 08:47.949
He won't help us,

08:47.950 --> 08:49.590
he never helps any more, you know that.

08:49.591 --> 08:52.829
Yes, my dear, I do,
so pray for a miracle

08:52.830 --> 08:55.030
because I think
we are going to need him.

09:01.510 --> 09:05.270
They've taken samples from snowmen
all over London.

09:06.470 --> 09:08.310
What do you suppose
they're doing in there?

09:08.311 --> 09:12.149
This snow is new. Possibly alien.

09:12.150 --> 09:14.828
When you find something
brand new in the world,

09:14.829 --> 09:18.870
something you've never seen before,
what's the next thing you look for?

09:20.470 --> 09:21.910
A grenade?

09:23.950 --> 09:25.350
A profit.

09:26.550 --> 09:28.789
That's Victorian values for you!

09:28.790 --> 09:31.110
I suggest a full frontal
assault with automated

09:31.111 --> 09:33.430
laser monkeys, scalpel mines and acid.

09:33.431 --> 09:34.789
Why?

09:34.790 --> 09:37.869
Couldn't we at least investigate?

09:37.870 --> 09:39.588
It's none of our business.

09:39.589 --> 09:43.228
Sir, permission to express my
opposition to your current apathy?

09:43.229 --> 09:44.430
Permission granted.

09:45.510 --> 09:48.669
Sir, I am opposed
to your current apathy.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.830
Let me out of here!
Thank you, Strax.

09:50.831 --> 09:55.389
And if ever I'm in need of advice
from a psychotic potato-dwarf,

09:55.390 --> 09:57.270
you'll certainly be the first to know.

09:57.271 --> 10:00.989
But if the snow is new and alien,

10:00.990 --> 10:03.550
shouldn't we be making
some attempt to destroy it?

10:03.551 --> 10:04.949
Be reasonable!

10:04.950 --> 10:07.149
Let me out!

10:07.150 --> 10:08.669
It is not our problem.

10:08.670 --> 10:12.150
Over a thousand years of saving
the universe, Strax,

10:12.151 --> 10:15.230
you know the one thing I learned?

10:16.550 --> 10:18.989
The universe doesn't care.

10:18.990 --> 10:21.029
Oi, Doctor! Let me out!

10:21.030 --> 10:24.310
Now, we have a problem of our own
to worry about...

10:24.311 --> 10:25.909
Let me out! Oi!

10:25.910 --> 10:28.308
Don't worry.
No-one's going to hurt you.

10:28.309 --> 10:30.388
What is that thing? Silence, boy!

10:30.389 --> 10:34.030
That's Strax and as you can see,
he's easily confused.

10:34.031 --> 10:36.749
Silence, girl. Sorry, lad.

10:36.750 --> 10:40.308
Sontaran. Clone warrior race - factory
produced, whole legions at a time.

10:40.309 --> 10:42.788
Two genders is a bit further
than he can count.

10:42.789 --> 10:45.429
Sir, do not discuss
my reproductive cycle

10:45.430 --> 10:48.068
in front of enemy girls!
It's embarrassing.

10:48.069 --> 10:50.068
Typical middle child of six million.

10:50.069 --> 10:51.908
Who are you? It doesn't matter

10:51.909 --> 10:54.510
because you're about to forget
that you and I ever met.

10:54.511 --> 10:56.789
We'll need the worm. Sir.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.588
You'll need the what? The worm?
What worm?

10:58.589 --> 11:00.830
Don't worry, it won't hurt,
but one touch on your bare

11:00.831 --> 11:03.070
skin and you'll lose the
last hour of your memory.

11:05.150 --> 11:06.629
Where is it?

11:06.630 --> 11:09.790
Where's what, sir?
I sent you to get the memory worm.

11:09.791 --> 11:13.029
Did you? When? Who's he?

11:13.030 --> 11:15.509
What are we doing here?

11:15.510 --> 11:17.709
Look, it's been snowing!

11:17.710 --> 11:20.148
You didn't use the gauntlets, did you?

11:20.149 --> 11:21.950
Why would I need the gauntlets?

11:23.590 --> 11:25.630
Do you want me to get the memory worm?

11:28.710 --> 11:32.190
Can you see it?
I think I can hear it.

11:33.750 --> 11:36.708
Oi, don't try to run away,
stay where you are.

11:36.709 --> 11:39.748
Why would I run? I know what's going
to happen next - and it's funny.

11:39.749 --> 11:41.529
What's funny? Your
little pal, for a start.

11:41.530 --> 11:43.308
Ugly little fella, isn't he?

11:43.309 --> 11:45.508
Maybe. He gave his life
for a friend of mine once.

11:45.509 --> 11:48.108
Then how come he's alive?
Another friend brought him back.

11:48.109 --> 11:52.230
I'm not sure all his brains made
the return trip! Neither am I.

11:52.231 --> 11:53.789
I can see it.

11:53.790 --> 11:56.430
Oooh! Can you reach it?
Have you got it?

11:58.470 --> 11:59.549
Got what, sir?

11:59.550 --> 12:02.628
Because these are the gauntlets,
aren't they?

12:02.629 --> 12:05.310
Sir! Emergency! I think I've been
run over by a cab!

12:07.470 --> 12:10.710
There you go. One touch and you lose
about an hour of your memory.

12:10.711 --> 12:14.030
Let it bite you
and you could lose decades.

12:18.350 --> 12:20.268
And you're still not trying to run.

12:20.269 --> 12:22.510
I don't understand how
the snowman built itself.

12:22.511 --> 12:24.749
I'll run once you've explained.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.349
Clara who? Doctor who?

12:26.350 --> 12:29.068
Oh, dangerous question.
What's wrong with dangerous?

12:29.069 --> 12:32.028
The snow emits a low level
telepathic field... My snowman...

12:32.029 --> 12:34.668
seems to reflect people's
thoughts and memories

12:34.669 --> 12:37.910
and because it's unusual, somehow it
carries a previous shape and...

12:37.911 --> 12:41.389
No, Doctor! My snowman!

12:41.390 --> 12:44.230
Ah! Interesting.
Well, were you thinking about it?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.670
Yes. Well, stop.

12:48.230 --> 12:51.149
Clara, stop thinking about the snowmen!

12:51.150 --> 12:53.309
Get down!

12:53.310 --> 12:57.289
Clara, listen to me, the snow is feeding
off your thoughts. I don't understand.

12:57.290 --> 12:59.250
You're caught in their
telepathic field, they're

12:59.251 --> 13:01.091
mirroring you. The more
you think about them,

13:01.092 --> 13:04.172
the more they appear. Imagine them
melting, picture it, picture them melted!

13:09.830 --> 13:12.670
Well, very good - very, very good!

13:13.670 --> 13:15.909
Is that going to happen again?

13:15.910 --> 13:18.150
If it does,
you know what to do about it.

13:19.350 --> 13:20.430
Unless I forget.

13:23.230 --> 13:26.108
Don't come looking for me -
forget about me. You understand?

13:26.109 --> 13:29.030
What about the snow?
Shouldn't we be warning people?

13:29.031 --> 13:30.549
Not my problem.

13:30.550 --> 13:32.149
Merry Christmas!

13:32.150 --> 13:34.190
Take her back
where we found her. Sir.

15:08.430 --> 15:09.870
Come on.

15:31.190 --> 15:32.950
Hello.

15:36.830 --> 15:38.270
Invisible.

15:47.150 --> 15:48.510
An invisible staircase.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.829
Hello?

17:26.990 --> 17:29.630
Hello?

17:36.150 --> 17:37.510
Hello?

18:00.910 --> 18:04.350
Tonight the thaw, tomorrow the snow
will fall again,

18:04.351 --> 18:07.229
yet stronger. The drowned woman

18:07.230 --> 18:11.229
and the dreaming child
will give us form at last.

18:11.230 --> 18:15.309
Tomorrow the snow will fall
and so shall mankind.

18:15.310 --> 18:17.030
She is coming.

18:40.310 --> 18:42.950
Look at that.
Must have thawed in the night.

18:44.430 --> 18:46.588
I'm begging you, Clara,
I'm on my knees.

18:46.589 --> 18:49.348
Elsie is back this afternoon -
I was only helping out.

18:49.349 --> 18:51.028
I've got my own work to get back to.

18:51.029 --> 18:53.150
What work?
Why won't you ever tell us?

18:54.990 --> 18:56.350
You'd never believe me!

19:17.950 --> 19:19.908
Alice, how smart you look today.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.868
The governess should
enter by the back door,

19:21.869 --> 19:23.350
unless accompanied by the children.

19:25.310 --> 19:28.030
And how are the children?
Excited about tomorrow?

19:28.031 --> 19:32.469
Francesca, same as ever.
Digby says he missed you every day.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.790
Captain Latimer wants to see you.
Of course.

19:39.430 --> 19:40.669
Every day?

19:40.670 --> 19:42.069
Twice on Saturdays.

19:42.070 --> 19:43.870
That's better.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.429
Captain Latimer.

19:53.430 --> 19:56.469
Ah. Miss Montague, you're back.

19:56.470 --> 19:58.349
In time for Christmas.

19:58.350 --> 20:00.890
Apologies for my brief
absence - family illness

20:00.891 --> 20:03.430
is so unpredictable.
You wanted to see me?

20:03.431 --> 20:06.029
Francesca has been having nightmares.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.228
Young girls often do.

20:07.229 --> 20:10.308
Every night this week, she says.
Won't tell me about them.

20:10.309 --> 20:13.950
Perhaps if you asked her in the right
way, there's no-one she'd rather tell.

20:13.951 --> 20:18.069
Children are not really
my area of expertise...

20:18.070 --> 20:21.109
They are, however, your children.

20:21.110 --> 20:24.510
You have, if I may say, a remarkable
amount of wisdom in these matters,

20:24.511 --> 20:28.390
for one so... very pretty,
Miss Montague.

20:29.910 --> 20:33.269
Young, I mean.

20:33.270 --> 20:34.870
I'll see to the children now.

20:43.390 --> 20:46.110
Miss Montague!
Miss Montague, you're back!

20:46.111 --> 20:47.269
Ah, ah, ah!

20:47.270 --> 20:49.908
Good morning, Miss Montague.
Good morning, Miss Montague.

20:49.909 --> 20:52.188
Good morning, Francesca.
Good morning, Digby.

20:52.189 --> 20:54.988
Christmas Eve is the most thrilling
day, don't you think?

20:54.989 --> 20:57.430
Now, what have you two been up to
while I've been away?

20:57.431 --> 20:58.989
I did seven drawings

20:58.990 --> 21:00.310
and we saw a dead cow.

21:01.870 --> 21:04.229
Well, how exciting!

21:04.230 --> 21:05.790
Do your secret voice!

21:09.390 --> 21:10.670
'Ello, mates!

21:13.670 --> 21:16.428
They're not exactly nightmares.
Just dreams.

21:16.429 --> 21:18.948
About our old governess -
the one who died.

21:18.949 --> 21:20.990
She's haunting
Frannie from beyond the grave!

21:22.790 --> 21:25.830
Haven't you spoken
to your father about this?

21:25.831 --> 21:29.109
You can't talk about things
like that to Daddy.

21:29.110 --> 21:30.749
You could try.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.350
Do you want to see where she died?

21:34.190 --> 21:36.989
She fell in there.

21:36.990 --> 21:41.270
And then it froze, she was
in the ice for days and days.

21:44.310 --> 21:46.189
I hated her.

21:46.190 --> 21:48.349
She was cross all the time.

21:48.350 --> 21:53.069
In Frannie's dream, she's still
down there, waiting to come back.

21:53.070 --> 21:55.630
Everything else has thawed,
but this pond...

21:57.150 --> 21:59.150
is still frozen.

22:01.990 --> 22:04.548
'The snow is feeding
off your thoughts...

22:04.549 --> 22:07.908
'the more you think about
the snowmen, the more they appear.'

22:07.909 --> 22:10.130
Frannie, this is important.
You dream about her.

22:10.131 --> 22:12.350
What do you dream?

22:12.351 --> 22:14.389
She's cross with me.

22:14.390 --> 22:16.910
She says I've been bad and she's
going to come out of the pond

22:16.911 --> 22:19.029
and punish me! When?

22:19.030 --> 22:22.709
She said she'd come back
for Christmas. Tonight.

22:22.710 --> 22:24.948
I think Frannie's gone mad, don't you?

22:24.949 --> 22:26.510
I think she needs a doctor.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.390
Doctor!

22:41.670 --> 22:44.029
Doctor!

22:44.030 --> 22:45.470
What's she looking at?

22:48.070 --> 22:49.710
She's asking for a doctor.

22:50.950 --> 22:52.670
Doctor!

22:53.830 --> 22:56.349
Now then, that's enough noise!

22:56.350 --> 22:58.868
We don't want to attract attention,
do we?

22:58.869 --> 23:01.510
I'm looking for the Doctor.
Do you know about him? The Doctor?

23:01.511 --> 23:03.350
Doctor who?

23:08.230 --> 23:11.270
Do not attempt to escape
or you will be obliterated!

23:11.271 --> 23:13.510
May I take your coat?

23:24.990 --> 23:26.070
Sit.

23:31.710 --> 23:35.750
There are two refreshments in
your world the colour of red wine.

23:35.751 --> 23:39.109
This is not red wine.

23:39.110 --> 23:41.308
Madame Vastra will ask you questions.

23:41.309 --> 23:44.390
You will confine yourself
to single word responses.

23:44.391 --> 23:47.390
One word only, do you understand?

23:48.670 --> 23:50.149
Why?

23:50.150 --> 23:54.150
Truth is singular -
lies are words, words, words.

23:55.590 --> 23:58.149
You met the Doctor, didn't you?
Yes.

23:58.150 --> 24:00.630
And now you've come
looking for him again. Why?

24:02.870 --> 24:06.190
Take your time. One word only.

24:07.710 --> 24:10.189
Curiosity. About? Snow.

24:10.190 --> 24:11.869
And about him? Yes.

24:11.870 --> 24:13.190
What do you want from him?

24:13.191 --> 24:16.069
Help. Why? Danger.

24:16.070 --> 24:17.510
Why would he help you?

24:19.710 --> 24:22.189
Kindness.

24:22.190 --> 24:24.189
The Doctor is not kind.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.709
No?

24:25.710 --> 24:28.070
No. The Doctor does not help people.

24:28.071 --> 24:31.189
Not anyone, not ever.

24:31.190 --> 24:33.949
He stands above this world

24:33.950 --> 24:36.788
and doesn't interfere
in the affairs of its inhabitants.

24:36.789 --> 24:39.790
He is not your salvation,
nor your protector.

24:41.030 --> 24:43.950
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

24:45.990 --> 24:46.950
Words.

24:49.870 --> 24:53.429
He was different once,

24:53.430 --> 24:54.470
a long time ago.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.670
Kind, yes.

24:59.150 --> 25:00.949
A hero, even,

25:00.950 --> 25:02.950
a saver of worlds.

25:05.190 --> 25:07.870
But he suffered losses which hurt him.

25:09.510 --> 25:13.150
Now he prefers isolation to
the possibility of pain's return.

25:16.550 --> 25:20.070
Kindly choose a word to indicate
your understanding of this.

25:24.550 --> 25:25.750
Man.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.869
We are the Doctor's friends.

25:33.870 --> 25:37.710
We assist him in his isolation but
that does not mean we approve of it.

25:38.750 --> 25:43.550
So... a test for you.

25:46.230 --> 25:48.388
Give me a message for the Doctor.

25:48.389 --> 25:51.550
Tell him all about the snow
and what fresh danger you believe

25:51.551 --> 25:56.310
it presents, and above all,
explain why he should help you.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.350
But do it in one word.

26:05.550 --> 26:08.388
You are thinking it is impossible
that such a word exists,

26:08.389 --> 26:10.030
or that you could even find it.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.910
Let's see if the gods are with you.

26:22.910 --> 26:25.829
Yes, what? I'm trying to read!

26:25.830 --> 26:28.308
'Miss Clara
and her concerns about the snow.'

26:28.309 --> 26:30.108
I gave her the one-word test.

26:30.109 --> 26:32.190
'Always pointless. What did she say?

26:33.950 --> 26:35.430
'Well? Well?'

26:37.430 --> 26:38.870
Pond.

26:44.950 --> 26:47.870
'Strax has already suggested
where to start investigating.'

26:54.110 --> 26:56.949
Danger. Danger.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.269
What's wrong?

26:58.270 --> 27:01.829
There is danger here.
An intelligence.

27:01.830 --> 27:05.270
An intelligence beyond anything
else in this time and place.

27:07.510 --> 27:10.628
Dr Simeon, sir, there's someone
demanding to see you.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.630
No callers, not in here, not ever.
Did he leave his name?

27:13.631 --> 27:16.230
Sir... it's Sherlock Holmes!

27:19.750 --> 27:23.828
Ooh, nice office. Big globey thing.
Now, shut up, don't tell me!

27:23.829 --> 27:25.669
I see from your collar
stud you have an apple

27:25.670 --> 27:27.428
tree and a wife with a limp. Am I right?

27:27.429 --> 27:29.469
No. But you've got a wife? No.

27:29.470 --> 27:32.509
Bit of a tree? Bit of a wife?
Some apples?

27:32.510 --> 27:33.708
Come on, work with me here.

27:33.709 --> 27:36.948
I enjoy The Strand magazine as much as
the next man but I am perfectly aware

27:36.949 --> 27:39.588
that Sherlock Holmes is
a fictional character. Get out!!

27:39.589 --> 27:41.830
Do you have a goldfish named Colin?

27:41.831 --> 27:43.270
No. Thought not.

27:44.870 --> 27:47.710
Now... Ooh! I see this is one
of your business cards...

27:47.711 --> 27:49.389
it says so on the front!

27:49.390 --> 27:51.430
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

27:53.070 --> 27:54.229
This.

27:54.230 --> 27:55.910
Wakey, wakey!

27:57.670 --> 28:02.469
That is highly valuable equipment,
you must step away now.

28:02.470 --> 28:04.669
We are the Intelligence.

28:04.670 --> 28:09.069
Oh! Talking snow. I love new things.

28:09.070 --> 28:10.788
You are not of this world.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.030
Takes one to SNOW one!

28:17.670 --> 28:19.109
Right, let's see.

28:19.110 --> 28:21.469
Multi-nucleate, crystalline
organism with the

28:21.470 --> 28:23.828
ability to mimic and
mirror what it finds.

28:23.829 --> 28:27.148
Looks like snow. Isn't snow.
You must leave here now!

28:27.149 --> 28:29.550
Shut up, I'm making deductions,
it's very exciting.

28:29.551 --> 28:31.350
Now, what are you, eh?

28:32.630 --> 28:36.669
A flock of space crystals? A swarm?

28:36.670 --> 28:39.988
The snowmen are foot soldiers,
mindless predators.

28:39.989 --> 28:41.989
But you - you're the clever one.
You're Moriarty.

28:41.990 --> 28:45.030
So you turn up on a planet,
you generate a telepathic field

28:45.031 --> 28:50.909
to learn what you can, and when
you've learnt enough, what do you do?

28:50.910 --> 28:53.350
You can't conquer the world
using snowmen.

28:53.351 --> 28:55.389
Snowmen are rubbish in July.

28:55.390 --> 28:58.670
You'll have to be better than that.
You'll have to evolve.

28:58.671 --> 29:00.749
Sir, it appears to be stuck!

29:00.750 --> 29:03.310
What have you done?
Have you locked the doors?

29:03.311 --> 29:08.309
You need to translate yourself
into something more, well, human.

29:08.310 --> 29:09.589
Kick it down!

29:09.590 --> 29:12.629
To do that you'd need a
perfect duplicate of

29:12.630 --> 29:15.668
human DNA in ice form -
where do you find that?

29:15.669 --> 29:18.470
Get in here! Quickly! I've got
a master key somewhere, sir.

29:18.471 --> 29:21.750
Let's see. Most opened file...
most viewed page.

29:21.751 --> 29:25.029
You really should delete your history!

29:25.030 --> 29:27.869
"Governess frozen in pond."

29:27.870 --> 29:29.309
Gotcha!

29:29.310 --> 29:31.109
Got it, sir!

29:31.110 --> 29:33.590
Get in here! Take him downstairs.

29:40.030 --> 29:45.349
Body frozen in a pond, the snow gets
a good long look at a human being,

29:45.350 --> 29:49.589
like a full body scan.
Everything they need to evolve.

29:49.590 --> 29:52.230
Pond. Good point, Clara.

29:55.710 --> 29:57.108
What are you doing here?

29:57.109 --> 29:59.870
Madame Vastra wondered
if you were needing any grenades?

29:59.871 --> 30:01.989
Grenades?

30:01.990 --> 30:04.629
She might have said help.

30:04.630 --> 30:07.469
Help for what?
Well, your investigation.

30:07.470 --> 30:10.268
Investigation?
Who says I'm investigating?

30:10.269 --> 30:12.948
Do you think I'm going to start
investigating

30:12.949 --> 30:16.390
just because some bird smiles at me?
Who do you think I am?

30:16.391 --> 30:18.270
Sherlock Holmes.

30:22.190 --> 30:25.989
Don't be clever, Strax,
it doesn't suit you.

30:25.990 --> 30:29.909
Sorry, sir. I'm the clever one,
you're the potato one.

30:29.910 --> 30:31.869
Yes, sir. Now go away.

30:31.870 --> 30:33.269
Yes...

30:33.270 --> 30:35.309
Mr Holmes.

30:35.310 --> 30:38.149
Oi! Shut up, you're not clever
or funny

30:38.150 --> 30:40.590
and you've got tiny little legs!

31:00.710 --> 31:03.430
OK, just tell her you're leaving,
you're not going up.

31:03.431 --> 31:05.190
Leaving, not going up.

31:08.430 --> 31:10.748
What was that all about -
five minutes,

31:10.749 --> 31:12.750
where did that come from?
You...

31:20.310 --> 31:23.670
It's the human male from the
Institute. What's he doing here?

31:26.230 --> 31:29.110
Suggest we melt his brain using
projectile acid fish,

31:29.111 --> 31:31.310
and then interrogate him.

31:32.990 --> 31:34.390
Other way round.

31:35.910 --> 31:38.110
Am I going to have
the nightmare tonight?

31:39.510 --> 31:41.510
Definitely not.
How do you know?

31:41.511 --> 31:44.309
Because someone's coming to help.

31:44.310 --> 31:46.589
Who?

31:46.590 --> 31:49.028
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

31:49.029 --> 31:52.108
Is it one of your stories?
Your definitely true ones?

31:52.109 --> 31:54.169
Huh! All my stories are true.
Like how you

31:54.170 --> 31:56.228
were born behind the
clock face of Big Ben?

31:56.229 --> 31:58.709
Accounting for my acute sense of time.
And you invented fish.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.990
Because I dislike swimming alone.

32:00.991 --> 32:02.430
So what's this one?

32:04.470 --> 32:06.710
There's a man called the Doctor.

32:07.750 --> 32:12.228
He lives on a cloud in the sky,
and all he does, all day every day,

32:12.229 --> 32:15.950
is to stop all the children
in the world ever having bad dreams.

32:15.951 --> 32:18.429
I've been having bad dreams.

32:18.430 --> 32:19.590
He's been on holiday.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.788
But I am confident
he has now returned to work.

32:23.789 --> 32:27.790
And as a matter of fact, he's right
here... Aren't you, Doctor?

32:30.510 --> 32:32.309
Bloomin' hell!

32:32.310 --> 32:34.348
The children have been very naughty!

32:34.349 --> 32:35.708
Get back, now, quickly.

32:35.709 --> 32:38.590
You're doing your other voice.
Yes, love, did you notice?

32:38.591 --> 32:41.229
Naughty, naughty children!!
RUN!

32:41.230 --> 32:44.509
What do we do?

32:44.510 --> 32:46.908
Frannie, Frannie, imagine her melting.

32:46.909 --> 32:48.710
What?! In your head, melt her.

32:48.711 --> 32:50.229
I can't!

32:50.230 --> 32:52.710
I'm getting impatient!

32:55.550 --> 32:58.509
You have been VERY naughty!

32:58.510 --> 33:01.348
What about the man? You said
the man was here, the cloud man.

33:01.349 --> 33:03.190
Well, he's not, is he?
Where's the Doctor?

33:03.191 --> 33:04.989
I don't know!

33:04.990 --> 33:08.189
Doctor?

33:08.190 --> 33:09.630
Doctor who?

33:17.390 --> 33:20.269
That's the way to do it!

33:20.270 --> 33:21.910
Oi, Ow!

33:40.550 --> 33:43.189
Where did she go?
Will she come back?

33:43.190 --> 33:47.028
No, don't worry. She's currently
draining through your carpet.

33:47.029 --> 33:50.388
New setting, anti-freeze,
and you're very welcome, by the way.

33:50.389 --> 33:52.148
I'm very grateful.
I knew you'd come.

33:52.149 --> 33:55.388
No, you didn't, because I don't.
Because this isn't the sort of thing

33:55.389 --> 33:58.430
I do any more. Next time you're in
trouble, don't expect me to...

34:02.310 --> 34:05.109
What is it? What's wrong?

34:05.110 --> 34:07.189
Sorry, it's just...

34:07.190 --> 34:08.750
Didn't know I'd put it on.

34:17.510 --> 34:19.268
Old habits...

34:19.270 --> 34:20.270
It's cooler.

34:25.070 --> 34:27.830
Yeah, it is, isn't it?
It is very cool.

34:29.310 --> 34:31.309
Bow ties are cool!

34:31.310 --> 34:34.188
No, the room.
The room is getting colder.

34:34.190 --> 34:38.190
She's coming back! What's she going
to do? Is she going to punish me?

34:38.190 --> 34:40.429
Uh... uh...

34:40.429 --> 34:41.708
She's learnt not to melt.

34:41.708 --> 34:45.148
Of course, she's not really
a governess, she's just a beast.

34:45.149 --> 34:46.590
She's going to eat you.

34:46.591 --> 34:48.829
Run.

34:48.830 --> 34:52.068
Children, what is exp...
Who the devil are you?!

34:52.069 --> 34:53.668
What are you doing in my house?

34:53.668 --> 34:56.628
It's OK! I am your governess'
gentleman friend,

34:56.629 --> 34:58.430
and we've just been upstairs...

34:58.431 --> 34:59.989
kissing!

34:59.990 --> 35:03.829
Captain Latimer, in the
garden, there's snowmen!

35:03.830 --> 35:08.470
And they're just growing, out of
nowhere, all by themselves - look!

35:10.070 --> 35:12.990
Good evening, I'm a lizard woman
from the dawn of time

35:12.991 --> 35:14.790
and this is my wife!

35:17.030 --> 35:20.310
This dwelling is under attack!
Remain calm, human scum!

35:25.030 --> 35:28.549
So! Any questions?

35:28.550 --> 35:31.270
You have a... gentleman friend?

35:33.270 --> 35:35.189
Vastra, what's happening?

35:35.190 --> 35:36.788
The snow is highly localised,

35:36.789 --> 35:39.548
and on this occasion
not naturally occurring.

35:39.549 --> 35:42.228
It's coming out of that cab
parked by the gates.

35:42.229 --> 35:45.628
Sir, one pulver grenade would blow
these snowmen to smithereens.

35:45.629 --> 35:49.148
They're made of snow, Strax,
they're already smithereens.

35:49.149 --> 35:50.948
See, Clara - our friends again.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.188
Clara? Who's Clara?

35:52.189 --> 35:54.489
Your current governess
is in reality a former

35:54.490 --> 35:56.788
barmaid called Clara.
That's the way to do it!

35:56.789 --> 36:00.028
Meanwhile your previous governess
is now a living ice sculpture

36:00.029 --> 36:02.550
impersonating Mr Punch.
Jenny, what have you got?

36:05.670 --> 36:07.189
Should hold it.

36:07.190 --> 36:10.630
Sir, this room - one observational
window on the line of attack

36:10.631 --> 36:12.909
and one defendable entrance.

36:12.910 --> 36:16.150
Right, everyone in there now,
move it. You - carry her.

36:18.230 --> 36:20.708
Nice to see you off your cloud
and engaging again.

36:20.709 --> 36:24.190
I'm not engaging again, I'm under
attack. You missed this, didn't you?

36:24.191 --> 36:26.069
Argh! Argh!

36:26.070 --> 36:28.349
Shut up!

36:28.350 --> 36:30.349
Strax, how long have we got?

36:30.350 --> 36:31.788
They're not going to attack.

36:31.789 --> 36:34.228
They made no attempt to conceal
their arrival.

36:34.229 --> 36:37.068
An attack force would never
abandon surprise so easily...

36:37.069 --> 36:39.308
and they're clearly
in a defence formation.

36:39.309 --> 36:41.470
Well done, Straxie, still got it!

36:42.790 --> 36:45.508
Sir, please do not noogie
me during combat prep.

36:45.509 --> 36:47.830
So there's something here they want.

36:47.831 --> 36:48.869
The Ice Woman.

36:48.870 --> 36:50.828
Exactly.
Why's she so important?

36:50.829 --> 36:54.588
Because she's a perfect duplication
of human DNA in ice crystal form.

36:54.589 --> 36:56.988
The ultimate fusion
of snow and humanity.

36:56.989 --> 37:00.228
To live here, the snow needs to
evolve - and she's the blueprint.

37:00.229 --> 37:01.870
She's what they need to become.

37:01.871 --> 37:05.909
When the snow melted last night,
did the pond? No.

37:05.910 --> 37:07.948
Living ice that will never melt.

37:07.949 --> 37:10.788
If the snow gets hold of that
creature on the stairs,

37:10.789 --> 37:14.230
it will learn to make more of them.
It will build an army of ice.

37:15.590 --> 37:18.590
And it will be the last day
of humanity on this planet.

37:24.110 --> 37:25.630
Stay here.

37:31.670 --> 37:33.148
Oi, I told you to stay in there.

37:33.149 --> 37:35.308
Oh, I didn't listen.
You do that a lot.

37:35.309 --> 37:37.550
It's why you like me.
Who said I like you?

37:37.551 --> 37:39.230
Argh!

37:44.630 --> 37:46.549
I think you just did.

37:46.550 --> 37:48.790
You kissed me.
You blushed. And we just...

37:48.791 --> 37:50.589
Shut up.

37:50.590 --> 37:52.510
Argh!

38:02.910 --> 38:04.789
Release her to us.

38:04.790 --> 38:06.430
You have five minutes.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.788
We need to get her out of here -
but keep her away from them.

38:16.789 --> 38:20.468
How? With this - do I always have to
state the obvious?

38:20.469 --> 38:22.708
Those creatures outside, what are they?

38:22.709 --> 38:25.909
No danger to you, as long as I get that
thing out of here! You, in there - now.

38:28.550 --> 38:29.628
What are you doing?

38:29.629 --> 38:31.988
Between you and me,
I can't wait to find out.

38:31.989 --> 38:34.630
Right, if you look after everyone
here, then I can...

38:34.631 --> 38:35.670
Clara! Doctor!

38:36.910 --> 38:38.948
That was stupid!
You were stupid, too!

38:38.949 --> 38:41.868
I'm allowed, I'm good at stupid!
That's the way to do it!

38:41.869 --> 38:43.769
Why does she keep saying that?
Mirroring,

38:43.770 --> 38:45.668
random mirroring. We
need to get on the roof.

38:45.669 --> 38:48.670
This way! I do the hand grabbing,
that's my job, that's always me!

38:48.671 --> 38:49.909
Come on, quickly!

38:49.910 --> 38:52.069
Agh! What are you doing?

38:52.070 --> 38:53.230
My bustle is stuck.

38:53.231 --> 38:55.189
Your bustle?!

38:55.190 --> 38:58.028
You're going to have to take those
clothes off!

38:58.029 --> 38:59.068
I didn't mean...

38:59.069 --> 39:01.708
I know. I understand, I do. Good.
What's the plan?

39:01.709 --> 39:03.789
Who said I've got a plan?
Course you've got a plan.

39:03.790 --> 39:05.150
You took that. Maybe I'm an idiot.

39:05.151 --> 39:08.589
You're not, you're clever.
Really clever.

39:08.590 --> 39:11.548
Are you? If I've got a plan,
what is it? You tell me.

39:11.549 --> 39:14.068
That's the way to do it!
Is this a test? Yes.

39:14.069 --> 39:15.308
What will it do to us?

39:15.309 --> 39:17.110
Kill us.
That's the way to do it!

39:19.790 --> 39:21.828
So, come on then - plan,
do I have one?

39:21.829 --> 39:23.909
I knew straight away. No, you didn't.
Course I did.

39:23.910 --> 39:25.268
Show me! Why should I?

39:25.269 --> 39:28.188
Because we'll be dead in under
30 seconds. Do I have a plan?

39:28.189 --> 39:31.228
If we'd been escaping,
we'd be climbing down the building.

39:31.229 --> 39:33.629
If we'd been hiding, we'd be
on the other side of the roof.

39:33.630 --> 39:34.830
But we're standing right here.

39:34.831 --> 39:36.669
So? So!

39:36.670 --> 39:38.469
After you. After you.

39:38.470 --> 39:40.590
After you, I'm wearing a dress.
Eyes front, soldier!

39:40.591 --> 39:42.310
My eyes are always front!

39:42.311 --> 39:44.030
Mine aren't.

39:46.390 --> 39:47.910
Stop it! No!

39:50.030 --> 39:52.468
I understand you're
the previous governess.

39:52.469 --> 39:55.590
I regret to inform you the position
is taken. Goodnight.

40:01.030 --> 40:04.469
So you can move your cloud?
You can control it.

40:04.470 --> 40:07.110
No, no-one can control clouds,
that would be silly.

40:07.111 --> 40:09.189
The wind, a little bit.

40:09.190 --> 40:13.030
She's following us! That's the idea.
Keep her away from the snow.

40:13.031 --> 40:16.029
So. Barmaid or governess,
which is it?

40:16.030 --> 40:18.668
That thing is after us,
and you want a chat?

40:18.669 --> 40:21.588
Well, we can't chat after we've been
horribly killed, can we?

40:21.589 --> 40:23.548
How did we get up so high so quick?

40:23.549 --> 40:25.988
Clever staircase,
it's taller on the inside!

40:25.989 --> 40:28.268
What am I standing on,
what's this made of?

40:28.269 --> 40:32.110
Super-dense water vapour. Should
keep her trapped, for the moment.

40:38.310 --> 40:40.828
So you actually live up here?
On a cloud, in a box?

40:40.829 --> 40:43.948
I have done, for a long time.
Blimey, you really know how to sulk.

40:43.949 --> 40:45.708
I'm not sulking! You live in a box!

40:45.709 --> 40:48.268
That's no more a box than
you are a governess.

40:48.269 --> 40:50.788
Oh, spoken like a man!
You're the same as all the rest.

40:50.789 --> 40:53.188
Sweet little Clara,
works at the Rose And Crown,

40:53.189 --> 40:55.588
ideas above her station!
For your information,

40:55.589 --> 40:58.190
I'm not sweet on the inside,
and I'm certainly not...

41:03.710 --> 41:05.390
little.

41:07.070 --> 41:12.110
It's called the TARDIS. It can
travel anywhere in time and space.

41:13.710 --> 41:15.509
And it's mine.

41:15.510 --> 41:17.349
But it's...

41:17.350 --> 41:20.029
Look at it, it's...

41:20.030 --> 41:22.670
Go on, say it, most people do.

41:34.830 --> 41:36.470
It's smaller on the outside!

41:38.110 --> 41:43.229
OK, that is a first.
Is it magic? Is it a machine?

41:43.230 --> 41:45.229
It's a ship. A ship?

41:45.230 --> 41:46.790
Best ship in the universe.

41:50.510 --> 41:52.309
Is there a kitchen?

41:52.310 --> 41:53.549
Another first.

41:53.550 --> 41:56.790
I don't know why I asked that, it's
just... I like making souffles.

42:01.670 --> 42:03.590
Souffles?!

42:05.110 --> 42:06.668
Why are you showing me all this?

42:06.669 --> 42:09.788
You followed me,
remember - I didn't invite you.

42:09.789 --> 42:11.950
You're nearly a foot taller than I am.

42:16.710 --> 42:21.150
You could've reached the ladder
without this - you took it for me.

42:21.151 --> 42:22.790
Why?

42:30.310 --> 42:32.709
I never know why.

42:32.710 --> 42:34.950
I only know who.

42:44.710 --> 42:46.029
What's this?

42:46.030 --> 42:47.909
Me.

42:47.910 --> 42:49.830
Giving in.

42:56.630 --> 42:58.350
I don't know why I'm crying...

42:58.351 --> 43:02.829
I do. Remember this -
this right now, remember all of it.

43:02.830 --> 43:05.829
Because this is the day,

43:05.830 --> 43:07.109
this is the day,

43:07.110 --> 43:10.110
this is the day everything begins.

43:17.030 --> 43:18.869
Clara! Get off of me!

43:18.870 --> 43:22.028
Water vapour doesn't stop ice,
I should've realised!

43:22.029 --> 43:23.908
Get off!
Let her go. Let her go now!

43:23.909 --> 43:25.150
NOW! Get off of me!

43:27.390 --> 43:28.670
Clara!

43:30.430 --> 43:31.669
Argh!

43:31.670 --> 43:33.470
Arr!

43:34.710 --> 43:36.510
No-o-o-o-o!

43:39.990 --> 43:41.830
What was that?

43:43.030 --> 43:44.869
It's Clara.

43:44.870 --> 43:45.869
Dear God.

43:45.870 --> 43:50.550
Oh, dear God, where did she fall from?

43:51.950 --> 43:53.390
We have to get her inside.

43:54.670 --> 43:56.870
Those things will kill you!
She's hurt.

43:56.871 --> 43:58.630
She's dead.

44:02.870 --> 44:05.590
What is that? What is happening?!

44:18.790 --> 44:20.190
He's bringing her in.

44:36.710 --> 44:39.788
That green woman said she was dead,
how can she be alive now?

44:39.789 --> 44:43.148
This technology has capacities
and abilities beyond anything

44:43.149 --> 44:45.830
your puny human mind could
possibly understand.

44:47.230 --> 44:48.630
Try not to worry.

45:05.710 --> 45:08.550
Isn't the creature still a danger?
It could reform.

45:08.551 --> 45:10.149
No, not in here.

45:10.150 --> 45:12.188
Then you should be with Miss Clara.

45:12.189 --> 45:15.350
She's going to be fine,
I know she is, she has to be.

45:16.470 --> 45:18.348
Doctor, her injuries are severe.

45:18.349 --> 45:21.870
That equipment will bring back
anyone for a while, but long term...

45:21.871 --> 45:22.989
It was my fault.

45:22.990 --> 45:26.270
I am responsible for what happened
to Clara, she was in my care!

45:28.270 --> 45:30.949
What is the point of blaming yourself?

45:30.950 --> 45:32.110
None.

45:34.510 --> 45:36.390
Because she's going to live.

46:00.830 --> 46:02.789
Hello.

46:02.790 --> 46:05.830
They all think I'm going to die,
don't they?

46:05.831 --> 46:08.270
And I know you're going to live.

46:09.270 --> 46:11.309
How?

46:11.310 --> 46:12.870
I never know how.

46:16.150 --> 46:19.070
I just know who.

46:24.190 --> 46:28.309
The green lady...

46:28.310 --> 46:31.350
she said you were
the saver of worlds once.

46:33.630 --> 46:35.270
Are you going to save this one?

46:36.710 --> 46:41.150
If I do, will you come away with me?

46:46.630 --> 46:47.670
Yes.

46:51.190 --> 46:52.710
Well then.

46:57.430 --> 46:59.190
Merry Christmas.

47:27.470 --> 47:30.710
I have in my hand
a piece of the Ice Lady.

47:32.470 --> 47:35.670
Everything you need to
know about how to make ice people.

47:37.670 --> 47:38.870
Is that what you want?

47:41.310 --> 47:42.510
See you at the office.

47:47.510 --> 47:50.428
So then, Doctor, saving the world
again? Might I ask why?

47:50.429 --> 47:52.708
Are you making a bargain
with the universe?

47:52.709 --> 47:54.788
You'll save the world to let her live?

47:54.789 --> 47:57.108
Yes! And don't you think,
after all this time

47:57.109 --> 47:59.548
and everything I've ever done,
I'm owed this one?

47:59.549 --> 48:01.708
I don't think the universe
makes bargains.

48:01.709 --> 48:02.630
It was my fault.

48:02.631 --> 48:03.590
Well then.

48:04.870 --> 48:06.550
Better save the world.

48:23.310 --> 48:26.188
You promised us something.
Have you brought it?

48:26.189 --> 48:29.428
Big fella here's been very quiet
while you've been out...

48:29.429 --> 48:32.510
which is only to be expected
considering who he really is.

48:35.430 --> 48:37.310
Know what this is, big fella?

48:37.311 --> 48:39.789
I do not understand these markings.

48:39.790 --> 48:45.269
A map of the London Underground,
1967 - key strategic weakness

48:45.270 --> 48:47.910
in metropolitan living, if you ask me,

48:47.911 --> 48:50.709
but then I have never liked a tunnel...

48:50.710 --> 48:52.029
Enough of this.

48:52.030 --> 48:55.430
We are powerful,
but on this planet we are limited.

48:55.431 --> 48:58.229
We need to learn to take human form.

48:58.230 --> 49:02.148
The Governess is our most perfect
replication of humanity...

49:02.149 --> 49:03.830
What's happening to its voice?

49:03.831 --> 49:06.869
Just stripping away the disguise.

49:06.870 --> 49:10.029
No, stop! Stop that, cease,
I command you!

49:10.030 --> 49:13.308
It sounds like a child. Of course it
sounds like a child, it IS a child.

49:13.309 --> 49:15.948
Simeon as a child,
the snow has no voice without him.

49:15.949 --> 49:18.310
Don't listen to him,
he's ruining everything!

49:18.311 --> 49:21.829
How long has the Intelligence
been talking to you?

49:21.830 --> 49:24.510
I was a little boy.
He was my snowman...

49:26.990 --> 49:28.629
He spoke to me.

49:28.630 --> 49:29.750
They're silly.

49:30.990 --> 49:34.028
But the snow doesn't talk,
does it - it's just a mirror.

49:34.029 --> 49:36.430
I don't want to talk to them,
they're silly.

49:36.431 --> 49:38.109
They're silly.

49:38.110 --> 49:42.269
It just reflects back everything
we think and feel and fear.

49:42.270 --> 49:44.589
I don't need anyone else.

49:44.590 --> 49:47.229
Don't need anyone else.

49:47.230 --> 49:49.510
You poured your darkest
dreams into a snowman...

49:49.511 --> 49:51.789
and look, look what it became!

49:51.790 --> 49:54.109
I don't understand.

49:54.110 --> 49:56.988
It's a parasite feeding
on the loneliness of a child

49:56.989 --> 49:58.870
and the sickness of an old man.

50:01.030 --> 50:04.870
Carnivorous snow meets
Victorian values...

50:07.070 --> 50:08.790
and something terrible is born.

50:09.950 --> 50:12.588
We can go on!
And do everything we planned.

50:12.589 --> 50:15.870
Oh, yes, and what a plan!
A world full of living ice people.

50:17.630 --> 50:22.389
Oh, dear me, how very Victorian of you.

50:22.390 --> 50:24.430
What's wrong with Victorian values?

50:26.630 --> 50:28.469
Are you sure?

50:28.470 --> 50:30.070
I have always been sure!

50:33.550 --> 50:35.590
Good.

50:38.630 --> 50:41.469
I'm glad you think so,

50:41.470 --> 50:45.149
since your entire adult life
is about to be erased.

50:45.150 --> 50:48.788
No parasite without a host,
without you, it will have no voice,

50:48.789 --> 50:51.150
without the governess,
it will have no form.

50:55.270 --> 50:58.710
What... What's happening, what's
happening, what did you do?

50:59.950 --> 51:03.589
You've got nothing left to mirror
any more.

51:03.590 --> 51:05.429
Goodbye.

51:05.430 --> 51:07.229
What did you... Did you...

51:07.230 --> 51:09.070
Did you...

51:10.310 --> 51:14.150
Did you really think
it would be so easy?

51:15.230 --> 51:17.869
That's not possible.

51:17.870 --> 51:20.349
How is that possible?

51:20.350 --> 51:21.470
Doctor!

51:39.030 --> 51:41.590
They're growing!
The snowmen are growing!

51:41.591 --> 51:44.429
What do we do?

51:44.430 --> 51:47.029
But you were just Dr Simeon.

51:47.030 --> 51:52.109
You're not real, he dreamed you,
how can you still exist?

51:52.110 --> 51:55.470
Now the dream outlives the dreamer
and can never die.

51:55.471 --> 51:58.229
Once I was the puppet.

51:58.230 --> 52:00.469
Now I pull the strings!

52:00.470 --> 52:05.749
I have tried
so long to take on human form.

52:05.750 --> 52:11.429
By erasing Simeon,
you made space for me.

52:11.430 --> 52:15.030
I fill him now.

52:18.590 --> 52:21.549
More than snow, more than Simeon...

52:21.550 --> 52:25.270
even this old body
is strong in my control.

52:27.950 --> 52:30.229
Argh!

52:30.230 --> 52:32.549
Do you feel it?

52:32.550 --> 52:35.349
Winter is coming!

52:35.350 --> 52:39.230
Argh! Winter is coming!

52:41.110 --> 52:42.629
No, you must fight!

52:42.630 --> 52:45.509
Hang on and fight, boy, you can do it!

52:45.510 --> 52:48.830
Captain Latimer...
your children...

52:50.990 --> 52:54.309
they are afraid.

52:54.310 --> 52:56.269
Hold them.

52:56.270 --> 52:59.909
It's not really my area.

52:59.910 --> 53:01.830
It is now.

53:19.550 --> 53:21.950
What's happening?

53:25.390 --> 53:27.668
Doctor! The globe.
It's turning to rain.

53:27.669 --> 53:29.430
All of it, the snow, look.

53:42.430 --> 53:46.109
He's dead. What happened?

53:46.110 --> 53:48.348
The snow mirrors, that's all it does.

53:48.349 --> 53:50.388
It's mirroring something else now.

53:50.389 --> 53:53.430
Something so strong,
it's drowning everything else.

54:06.070 --> 54:08.468
There was a critical
mass of snow at the house.

54:08.469 --> 54:10.270
If something happened there...

54:14.990 --> 54:17.030
Salty. Salt water rain.

54:18.030 --> 54:19.629
It's not raining.

54:19.630 --> 54:20.830
It's crying.

54:22.190 --> 54:24.908
The only force on Earth
that could drown the snow,

54:24.909 --> 54:27.550
a whole family crying on Christmas Eve.

54:43.990 --> 54:47.309
I'm sorry.
There was nothing to be done.

54:47.310 --> 54:49.870
She has moments only.

55:09.190 --> 55:13.669
We saved the world, Clara, you and me.

55:13.670 --> 55:15.470
We really, really did.

55:16.910 --> 55:19.750
Will you go back... to your cloud?

55:20.950 --> 55:22.790
No more cloud. Not now.

55:24.030 --> 55:25.190
Why not?

55:33.150 --> 55:34.350
It rained.

55:41.430 --> 55:43.949
Run.

55:43.950 --> 55:46.950
Run, you clever boy.

55:51.230 --> 55:52.150
And remember.

55:56.470 --> 55:59.149
It's Christmas.

55:59.150 --> 56:01.590
Christmas Day.

56:13.550 --> 56:17.068
And what about the Intelligence?
Melted with the snow?

56:17.069 --> 56:21.548
No, I shouldn't think so. It learned
to survive beyond physical form.

56:21.549 --> 56:24.748
Well, we can't be in much danger
from a disembodied Intelligence

56:24.749 --> 56:27.428
that thinks it can invade
the world with snowmen.

56:27.429 --> 56:30.630
Or that the London Underground
is a key strategic weakness.

56:36.110 --> 56:40.349
The Great Intelligence... rings
a bell...

56:40.350 --> 56:42.830
the Great Intelligence?

56:44.630 --> 56:46.270
Doctor?

56:57.670 --> 57:00.228
I never knew her name, her full name.

57:00.229 --> 57:03.948
Oswin Oswald, junior entertainment
manager, Starship Alaska.

57:03.949 --> 57:04.950
Souffle girl...

57:06.990 --> 57:10.669
Oswin - it was her.

57:10.670 --> 57:14.549
Run, you clever boy.

57:14.550 --> 57:18.589
And remember.

57:18.590 --> 57:20.390
It was souffle girl again.

57:22.230 --> 57:25.750
I never saw her face the first time
with the Daleks, but her voice,

57:25.751 --> 57:27.829
it was the same voice.

57:27.830 --> 57:32.588
Doctor?! The same woman, twice, and
she died both times, the same woman!

57:32.589 --> 57:34.628
Doctor, what are you talking about?

57:34.629 --> 57:38.308
Something's going on, something
impossible, something...

57:38.309 --> 57:42.188
Right, you two stay here, stay
right here, don't move an inch.

57:42.189 --> 57:44.028
Are you coming back?
Shouldn't think so!

57:44.029 --> 57:45.390
But where are you going?

57:45.391 --> 57:49.029
To find her, to find Clara.

57:49.030 --> 57:50.109
Ha-ha-ha!

57:50.110 --> 57:54.149
But Clara's dead. What's
he talking about, finding her?

57:54.150 --> 57:59.430
I don't know, but perhaps the
universe makes bargains after all.

58:03.270 --> 58:05.909
Where are you going?

58:05.910 --> 58:07.309
Short cut.

58:07.310 --> 58:10.990
Through there? I hate this place!
Don't you think it's creepy?

58:10.991 --> 58:14.630
No, I don't believe in ghosts.

58:18.270 --> 58:19.909
Clara!

58:19.910 --> 58:21.749
Oswin!

58:21.750 --> 58:23.590
Oswald!

58:26.030 --> 58:27.910
Watch me run!

58:28.413 --> 58:36.413

58:57.430 --> 58:59.149
Ha-ha! Miss me?

58:59.150 --> 59:00.188
Who the hell are you?

59:00.189 --> 59:03.588
I'm the Doctor. I'm an alien from
outer space. I'm 1,000 years old.

59:03.589 --> 59:04.628
I've got two hearts.

59:04.629 --> 59:06.068
And I can't fly a plane.

59:06.069 --> 59:09.668
You're running away with a space man in
a box, anything could happen to you.

59:09.669 --> 59:11.308
That's what I'm counting on.

59:11.309 --> 59:12.908
Where do you want to go, hey?

59:12.909 --> 59:14.150
What do you want to see?

59:16.190 --> 59:18.189
Rrr!

59:18.190 --> 59:19.110
Argh!

59:23.390 --> 59:25.109
Is that her?

59:25.110 --> 59:26.549
The woman twice dead.

59:26.550 --> 59:28.268
She's rather pretty, isn't she?

59:28.269 --> 59:29.230
She's not possible.

59:31.270 --> 59:32.830
Right then, Clara Oswald.

59:35.670 --> 59:37.910
Time to find out who you are.
