The note on the garage door
says he's here.

Don't worry about it, boss.
I'll find him.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.226
Um...

01:37.364 --> 01:39.389
Hey, uh... hey, kid,
are you the mechanic?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.092
Me? A mechanic?

01:41.235 --> 01:43.135
Do you see any grease
under those nails?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.432
(laughs)
Me a mechanic.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.631
Look, now, fellas, we really
don't have time for games.

01:47.775 --> 01:48.833
We're looking for the mechanic.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.535
He's probably looking
for Fonzie.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.545
Uh, if it's about your daughter,
we never heard of him.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.911
Hey, can the wisecracks,
will you, chicky?

01:57.051 --> 01:58.541
Do you know
who you're talking to?

01:58.686 --> 01:59.744
Uh, Hinstead, forget it.

01:59.887 --> 02:00.911
This happens to be one

02:01.055 --> 02:02.545
of the biggest talent scouts
in Hollywood.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.089
-(Potsie laughs)
- MAN: Hinstead!

02:04.224 --> 02:06.090
Hollywood talent scout
here in Milwaukee? (laughs)

02:06.226 --> 02:07.455
Right, and I'm Pinocchio.

02:07.594 --> 02:08.618
HINSTEAD:

02:10.931 --> 02:12.057
we have some auditions
in Chicago,

02:12.199 --> 02:13.394
and-and our car broke down.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.729
I mean, what's the difference?

02:14.868 --> 02:16.962
Just show us where we can find
this Fonzie guy, okay?

02:17.104 --> 02:18.594
Hey, Pots, get a load of this.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.764
"Jack Duvall, talent scout,
Paramount Pictures, Hollywood."

02:20.908 --> 02:22.239
This guy's on the level!

02:22.376 --> 02:23.810
- Hollywood?!
- All right, I do comedy.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.503
- Wait till you see this.
- You see?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.171
Here we go.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.941
Good evening, ladies and germs.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.573
How do you like me so far?

02:30.718 --> 02:32.550
- You're doing great, Malph.

Here. Here.
What can I get for you?

02:46.433 --> 02:48.094
Can you get rid
of these two clowns, please?

02:48.235 --> 02:49.600
Oh, no, no, no. I'm the clown.
He only sings.

03:11.391 --> 03:12.517
That's enough.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.684
I don't want to chap my lips.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.930
Hey, Alfredo, life is great.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.090

03:20.234 --> 03:21.326
That's Fonzie.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.936
Oh, no, no,
don't worry about it, chief.

Hey, uh, hey, kid,
where you been?

03:33.147 --> 03:35.047
Kid?

03:35.182 --> 03:36.809
Well, well,
whatever your name is.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.440
L-Look, you got
to fix our limousine.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.713
This kid is on a break.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.982
(slow ballad plays)

03:52.032 --> 03:53.363
Get a load of that kid.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.298
That hood's got some nerve.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.869
Yeah.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.563
Don't worry, boss.
I'll take care of him.

03:58.705 --> 03:59.968
- Sit down, Hinstead.
- Right, boss.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.666
Let me handle this.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.470
Excuse me, sir?

04:03.610 --> 04:05.305
Sir. That's very nice.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.470
What can I do for you?

04:07.614 --> 04:09.241
Well, look, I'm terribly sorry
to bother you,

04:09.383 --> 04:11.477
but, uh, do girls always
run to you like this?

04:11.618 --> 04:14.019
I got to tell you,
this crowd is, uh, slow.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.485
Usually, they jump.

04:15.622 --> 04:18.557
Well, I want to tell you
that, uh,

04:18.692 --> 04:20.023
I'm a Hollywood talent scout.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.286
Oh, no. Thanks very much,

04:21.428 --> 04:23.920
but I discovered all the talent
I need right here.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.361
Oh, no. (laughs)

04:25.499 --> 04:27.490
No. no. no, no.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.935
I, uh...

04:31.071 --> 04:32.334
I-I don't think you understand.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.031
You see, I've been combing
the country

04:34.174 --> 04:36.108
for America's new James Dean.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.041
James Dean.
Now, that's important.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.203
I'll have your limo ready
in an hour, Jack.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.644
Now, wait, wait.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.181
Now, I...
I've been watching you,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.285
and I think you've got a lot
of potential.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.183
I mean, you could be
the next James Dean,

04:47.321 --> 04:48.618
the hottest star
in this country.

04:48.755 --> 04:51.918
Couldn't we have this convo
when I finish my dance?

04:52.059 --> 04:54.050
I'm serious.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.958
No, look, I'm serious. I...

04:56.096 --> 04:57.291
Aren't you excited?

04:57.431 --> 04:58.592
Hey, look at this.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.326
Anybody's excited
with a few minutes with Daphne.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.636
This guy is really cool.

05:05.772 --> 05:08.207
I mean, did you see the way
the girls run up to him

05:08.342 --> 05:09.832
when he snaps his fingers?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.604
I mean, this guy has magic!

05:11.745 --> 05:14.180
Hey, good. He'll be able to fix
our limo like that.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.543
Forget the car.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.743
Hinstead, I think we've stumbled
onto a major new talent.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.615
HOWARD:
<i>I</i> don't see

05:20.754 --> 05:22.779
<i>why you don't want to go
to the convention.</i>

05:22.923 --> 05:26.689
Dad, I'm sorry, but this is
my last summer before college,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.295
and I've got to do
something big.

05:28.428 --> 05:29.759
I've got to do
something exciting,

05:29.897 --> 05:31.956
and that's why I can't go
to the Leopard Convention.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.067
What's wrong
with the Leopard Convention?

05:34.201 --> 05:36.829
Well, I'll tell you
what's wrong with it.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.837
Leopards, Leopards,
we are true.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.238
We won't change our spots
for you.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.343
Dad, that is not my idea
of exciting.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.350
Well, of course
it's not exciting!

05:52.486 --> 05:53.544
You forgot to growl.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.246
(growls)

05:55.389 --> 05:57.585
What are you trying
to do to me, anyway?

05:57.724 --> 05:59.419
It'll be a fun
family vacation.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.993
What-what vacation, Dad?

06:01.128 --> 06:02.186
It's here in Milwaukee.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.627
Oh. Marion. Mar... tell him.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.028
Tell him!

06:06.166 --> 06:07.361
Richie's right!

06:11.138 --> 06:14.005
Howard Cunningham,
I have something to say.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.165
Oh.

06:15.309 --> 06:17.641
We have scrimped and saved
all year!

06:17.778 --> 06:20.338
Now, we didn't do this
to go to downtown Milwaukee.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.504
- That's right, Dad.
- Yeah.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.377
How can I tell my mother
we went on vacation,

06:23.517 --> 06:25.212
and we spent 80 cents for gas?

06:26.420 --> 06:28.445
And that's if we take
the long way!

06:28.588 --> 06:30.249
-(overlapping chatter)
- I don't care, Marion.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.358
Every summer,
we go to the conven...

06:32.492 --> 06:34.483
Low.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.291
Now, you all know
my cousin Chachi.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.763
There's your little boyfriend.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.130
- Hold your breath.
-(Richie laughs)

06:43.170 --> 06:44.695
How you doing, blue eyes?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.636
What are you selling today,
shrimp?

06:46.773 --> 06:49.037
Oh, no. I sold all the shrimp
to Alfred.

06:49.176 --> 06:52.612
But for you,
I got no-smear lipstick.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.646
We can test it out later.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.772
Wah, wah, wah.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.014
Yeah. I-l beg
your indulgence, Mr. C.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.918
Uh, we're not here
to make you out.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.546
We're not here to sell.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.159
The reason
I brought Chachi along

07:06.293 --> 07:08.489
is 'cause he's got
some very hot info.

07:08.628 --> 07:09.720
Take it away.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.194
Oh, yeah, really hot.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.265
(loudly):
Ladies and gentlemen!

07:13.400 --> 07:14.868
Shy little fellow.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.403
My cousin,
the one and only Fonz...

07:17.537 --> 07:18.766
That's me.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.930
...got discovered
by a talent scout at Arnold's,

07:21.074 --> 07:22.803
and he's going to Hollywood!

07:22.943 --> 07:24.536
- Oh, that's amazing!
- Oh! Oh, goodness.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.305
- Wonderful!
- That's great!

07:26.446 --> 07:29.438
Kids, imagine,
I have cooked veggies

07:29.583 --> 07:32.109
for a Hollywood star.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.845
Well, this is all very exciting,

07:33.987 --> 07:36.081
but why is Chachi
telling us this?

07:36.223 --> 07:38.317
Modesty wouldn't allow me.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.552
Of course I'll be keeping an eye
on the garage

07:42.696 --> 07:43.754
while Fonzie's gone.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.730
Chach, this is my moment,
not yours.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.392
Hey, is it really true?

07:48.535 --> 07:50.401
Oh, yeah. He's not a star yet,

07:50.537 --> 07:53.404
but he will be after they make
a screen test in Hollywood.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.735
Ah, just a formality.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.375
CHACHI:
Have fun in Hollywood, Fonz.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.105
Catch you later, blue eyes.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.612
That'll be the day.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.716
Oh. Oh, Arthur.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.750
You don't need a screen test.

08:05.886 --> 08:09.584
You will be a star
the minute they see you.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.155
(doorbell rings)

08:13.293 --> 08:15.284
Come in.

08:23.437 --> 08:24.871
Oh, hi, Ralph. Hi, Potsie.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.996
They recognized us.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.901
Rich, you're not
gonna believe it.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.374
Pots and I here are going

08:31.511 --> 08:33.342
to Hollywood tomorrow
with the Fonz.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.142
D-Da-Dad,
they're going to Hollywood!

08:36.283 --> 08:37.250
RALPH:
You bet.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.078
Our last big fling, Rich.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.950
Da-Dad, our last big fling!

08:42.089 --> 08:44.615
Ralph, why are you carrying
an ironing board?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.157
I took off the legs.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.920
Now it's a surf board.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.529
Oh! Da-Dad, did you hear that?

08:49.663 --> 08:50.721
He's gonna be surfing.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.424
Hey, I just got a flash.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.696
Why don't the Cunningham brood
hop a ride

08:56.837 --> 09:00.330
on my trip to stardom?

09:00.474 --> 09:02.704
On behalf of the family,
I accept.

09:02.843 --> 09:06.336
(overlapping chatter
and exclamations)

09:06.480 --> 09:08.073
Now, wait a minute.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.410
- Wait a minute!
-(group quiets)

09:09.549 --> 09:11.017
Now, the convention starts
tomorrow,

09:11.151 --> 09:13.347
and I've already donated
the dust pans!

09:13.487 --> 09:15.683
Oh, Howard, come on now!

09:15.822 --> 09:17.381
Think about this!

09:17.524 --> 09:18.958
Now, we're a democratic family.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.184
We want to go!

09:20.327 --> 09:22.523
Marion, I'm going
to be the Exalted Keeper

09:22.662 --> 09:24.653
of the Leopard Lodge!

09:24.798 --> 09:26.129
Joanie, Joanie,
this is for Hollywood.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.064
Show your dimples.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.397
Don't you understand?

09:30.537 --> 09:33.302
That's the first step
to becoming the Grand Poobah.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.140
And a man has got to do
what he's got to do.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.143
And I'm gonna do
what I got to do.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.844
And we're gonna go
to California.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.917

indistinct chatter)

- Yeah. -Now, here's the script
for your screen test.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.292
Now, study it and learn
the lines by tomorrow.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.450
The test is at 8:00.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.618
Oh, he'll-he'll be ready.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.252
Uh, the limousine will be here
at 6:00.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.729
Hey, who am I making
a movie with, roosters?

10:32.866 --> 10:33.958
(chuckles)

10:34.100 --> 10:35.795
Come on, you'll need
some makeup.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.233
Makeup?
Hey, let me tell you something.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.338
I'm supposed to be the new
James Dean, not the new...

10:39.472 --> 10:40.530
(in high-pitched voice):
Natalie Wood.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.301
(chuckles)

10:42.442 --> 10:44.376
Well, she has to get up at 5:00.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.104
Now, the limo will be here
at 6:00.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.908
- Now, you got to be ready.
- HINSTEAD: Hey, boss?

10:49.049 --> 10:52.383
Hey, I'll tell you,
it ain't easy being a star.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.185
Well, what do you think
of it, huh?

10:56.323 --> 11:00.317
Oh, Mr. C, that is
a beauty of a shirt.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.087
- Yeah?
- What did you do, plug it in?

11:02.229 --> 11:03.458
(Richie chuckles)

11:03.597 --> 11:05.759
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I was just kidding.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.663
It's nice. It's nice, Dad.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.098
Yeah. Thanks.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.931
One out of two isn't bad.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.095
Nice shirt.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.832
Oh, thank you.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.137
Uh, look, I-I-I want to see
if I can find that, uh...

11:17.277 --> 11:18.438
that drugstore.

11:18.578 --> 11:21.070
You know, the one where
Lana Turner was discovered in?

11:21.214 --> 11:23.876
I, uh... I got to buy
some suntan lotion.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.990
Yeah, I see where it is.
Yeah.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.292
Say, uh, listen,
I read in <i>Life</i> magazine

11:39.432 --> 11:41.901
that most of the Hollywood stars
stay in those cottages

11:42.035 --> 11:43.594
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.535
Oh, that's not true,
Mr. Cunningham.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.107
No? Well, they wouldn't stay at
a place like this, would they?

11:48.241 --> 11:50.266
- Sure, they would.
- Why?

11:50.410 --> 11:51.673
Because this is better.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.609
Besides, it's near the beach.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.613
- Oh, yeah. Maybe you're right.
-(Duvall chuckles)

11:55.749 --> 11:56.910
Excuse me.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.109
Could you, uh, tell me
where I check in?

11:59.252 --> 12:00.981
Oh, yeah, the lobby
is right through that arch

12:01.121 --> 12:02.179
and to your right.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.585
Right through the arch
and to the right?

12:03.723 --> 12:04.918
Uh-huh.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.049
That's a beauty of a shirt.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.052
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.826
Hey, isn't that Lorne Greene?

12:13.967 --> 12:16.902
Lorne Greene?
At the Hollywood Palms?

12:17.037 --> 12:19.028
(laughs)

12:23.143 --> 12:24.941
Hi, Dad. Bye, Dad.
I'm going to the beach.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.512
Just a minute, young lady.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.239
I'd like to see
your bathing suit.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.816
- Can't I just tell you about it?
- Let's see it.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.653
Straps are nice.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.815
Now, you get back in there and
put on the rest of that suit.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.722
Uh, Mother said
it was all right.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.726
Marion!

12:42.862 --> 12:44.091
Mar...

12:45.198 --> 12:46.495
Now...

12:53.473 --> 12:57.103
Now, that's what I call
a decent bathing suit.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.268
Marion, did you see Joanie?

12:59.412 --> 13:01.642
She's got a figure.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.374
(Coughs)

13:03.516 --> 13:05.109
Fonz, what's the matter?
You got a cold?

13:05.251 --> 13:07.583
No, I'll tell you something--
the smog here is drastic.

13:07.721 --> 13:10.656
Oh, yeah, smog, yeah.
This is Hollywood.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.485
<i>II</i>

13:12.625 --> 13:16.084

13:16.229 --> 13:18.459
(squealing laughter)

13:20.266 --> 13:22.860
Heyyy. (chuckles)

13:23.002 --> 13:24.026
I tell you something,
Cunningham,

13:24.170 --> 13:27.265
this is fun in the sun.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.205
- Fonz?
- Yeah?

13:29.342 --> 13:32.039
Ha-Have you noticed that you're
the only person on the beach

13:32.178 --> 13:33.168
wearing a leather jacket?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.714
Course I noticed.
It brings me luck.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.049
Hi. I'm Wendy.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.119
I just love your leather jacket.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.120
Need I say more?

13:43.256 --> 13:44.746
I'm getting rid
of my rabbit's foot.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.451
Marion, I don't know why
you're wearing that outfit.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.062
Well, you know I burn so.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.822
Yeah, but it covers up
your bathing suit.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.557
And that suit cost me $20.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.565
The least you could do
is to carry it.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.726
Well, that's silly.
I'd get arrested.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.599
Well, this looks like
a good spot.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.206
Oh, it certainly does.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.739
Watch it, Howard.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.104
I am. I am.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.540
Oh, Howard!

14:04.677 --> 14:07.840
Oh... oh, I'm terribly sorry.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.346
Watch it, chowderhead.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.745
Ch-Chowderhead?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.648
Yeah. Chowderhead.

14:12.786 --> 14:14.652
You guys really lift weights?

14:14.788 --> 14:16.654
Well, why don't we
just show you?

14:16.790 --> 14:17.848
Come on, guys.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.153
- Yeah.
- Show me? Um...

14:20.293 --> 14:22.455
- One, two, three.
-(Joanie laughs)

14:22.595 --> 14:24.495
-(whooping)
- You okay up there?

14:24.631 --> 14:27.430
Uh, when you pick a girl up,
you really pick her up.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.092
Oh, I like a girl
I can look up to.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.329
-(laughing)
- Let's go. Hey.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.200
Aah!

14:33.339 --> 14:35.398
Look at this, Pots.
Look where we are.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.567
-(chuckles)
- I can't wait to hit the surf.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.303
On an ironing board?

14:39.446 --> 14:40.845
I think your tide's
gone out, Malph.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.177
It'll work. I can see the
headlines in Milwaukee now:

14:44.317 --> 14:46.513
"Malph hangs ten in Pacific."

14:47.720 --> 14:49.586
Hope you can get it
to stay this time, dear.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.190
I don't want to burn.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.758
(grunts)

14:52.892 --> 14:53.984
What's to burn?

14:54.127 --> 14:55.754
The only thing
you've got in the sun

14:55.895 --> 14:57.863
are your tongue
and your toenails.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.192
Ah.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.663
Oh! Howard, my hat.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.699
It's lovely, dear.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.462
No, it blew off.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.129
Oh, Jiminy Crickets, Marion.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.740
Hurry.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.672
Oh, Howard, sand.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.076
Oh!

15:15.215 --> 15:16.910
- Watch it.
- Look out.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.017
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.846
ALL:
Chowderhead!

15:19.986 --> 15:22.114
I know your father.

15:22.255 --> 15:26.123
(kiss) Oh, my soft angel, we got
to get you some suntan lotion.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.818
You're getting all red.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.225
Your drugstore or mine?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.354
FONZIE:
Heyyy.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.900
Uh, Fonz?

15:36.035 --> 15:38.470
We really do need
to memorize these lines.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.936
Hey, Rich?

15:40.073 --> 15:44.306
This is one part
I know by heart.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.969
Later.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.314
Later.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.473
(screaming, cheering)

15:50.617 --> 15:51.812
Look, Howard.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.419
They're tossing
that girl in the air.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.543
Isn't that fun?

15:54.687 --> 15:56.917
(whooping)

15:57.056 --> 15:59.047
That's not just
some girl, Marion.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.557
That's our daughter.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.627
Hey, Ralph, Potsie,
what's going on?

16:02.762 --> 16:05.094
Rich, some girl
down the beach lost her top!

16:05.231 --> 16:07.529
Come on, Rich, before some
weirdo gives her a towel.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.896
(Potsie whoops)

16:09.035 --> 16:11.026
Beach life.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.867
Oh. (grunts)

16:16.009 --> 16:18.444
Just thought I'd... drop in.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.807
No, actually, I didn't see you.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.812
Uh, are you all right?
Are you hurt?

16:21.948 --> 16:24.645
Uh, no, no, but you're
lying on my legs.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.582
Oh. Oh, right. I-I'm sorry.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.084
Excuse me.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.586
- It's all right.
-(g ru nts)

16:29.722 --> 16:31.986
Hi. I'm Nancy Croft.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.786
Oh, hi.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.520
I'm, uh...
I'm Richie Cunningham.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.421
Uh, you're carrying a script.
Are you an actor?

16:39.566 --> 16:42.433
No. No, I'm a... I'm a writer.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.128
Oh, did you write that script?

16:44.270 --> 16:45.999
(chuckles) Well-well, yeah, I...

16:46.139 --> 16:48.904
Sort of, you know.
I worked, uh...

16:49.042 --> 16:50.134
Well, actually, no.

16:50.276 --> 16:51.801
No, it belongs
to a friend of mine.

16:51.945 --> 16:54.437
Oh, but you do write
for movies or for TV, right?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.208
(laughs)

16:56.349 --> 16:58.113
I-I'm more of a journalist.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.480
Let's talk about you.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.281
Well, uh...
what do you want to know?

17:02.422 --> 17:05.050
Well, uh...

17:05.191 --> 17:08.387
could I rub some
suntan lotion on you?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.758
I don't have any.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.059
Oh.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.292
Your drugstore or mine?

17:15.435 --> 17:18.405
(short laugh)
What are you talking about?

17:18.538 --> 17:19.733
POTSIE:
Hey, wait a minute.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.237
Another girl's top fall off?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.967
Better. They caught a shark.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.373
A live shark.
They got it penned up out there

17:25.511 --> 17:27.569
until Marineland
can come and pick it up.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.744
Did you hear that, Malph?
Isn't that great?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.079
They caught a live shark.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.120
- Great.
- A live shark!

17:36.255 --> 17:39.316
Shark! Pots! A shark.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.553
Pots, come on! Help.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.685
Where is he? Where?

17:50.203 --> 17:52.194
Shark! Aah!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.701
Everybody switch.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.806
Checking galleys?

17:59.946 --> 18:01.380
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's very critical work.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.777
Oh, that's nice.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.906
Hey, Cunningham, you ready
to go over that script now?

18:05.051 --> 18:06.041
Oh, not now, Fonz.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.983
- Haven't got time.
- What?

18:08.121 --> 18:10.920
Oh, well, I-l met
a nice girl here.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.855
This is Nancy Croft.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.859
Hey, you met a beach bunny,
huh? (quick chuckle)

18:15.995 --> 18:18.157
I... I'm not a beach bunny.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.061
I'm an oceanography major
at UCLA.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.463
Yeah. Oceanography?

18:22.602 --> 18:23.865
Oh, that's study of the sea.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.994
I knew that. I knew that.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.470
Have you seen the shark yet?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.974
You telling me there's
a real shark out there?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.304
Yeah, I sure do. A man-eater.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.344
They caught him. They got him
in a cage underwater.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.538
You want to swim out
and take a look at him?

18:35.682 --> 18:37.548
Yeah, let's go swim out
and take a look at the shark.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.743
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold it,
hold it. Time out, here.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.684
You seen one man-eater,
you seen 'em all.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.654
MAN:
Hey, Nancy!

18:49.328 --> 18:51.854
(crowd gasps)

18:56.569 --> 18:57.968
(people whoop, applaud)

18:59.005 --> 19:00.700
Who is that guy?
Great skier.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.069
He's my cousin.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.142
They call him
the California Kid.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.507
His real name's Harold.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.550
Hey, hey, girls.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.850
-(kiss)
- All right. Yeah.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.389
Hi, Nance.

19:19.525 --> 19:20.617
Hey, girls.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.353
What'd you think
of my perfect landing?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.587
Great.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.129
Do you know that Fonzie...

19:25.264 --> 19:27.460
All right, girls,
you can drop the B-squad.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.090
The first team is here.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.567
Well, it looks like we got
a shutout here, you know?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.172
Home team, zip.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.741
Fonz, uh, one, two,
three, four, uh, five.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.274
(chuckles)

19:37.410 --> 19:39.742
Where'd you come from, paleface?

19:39.879 --> 19:42.143
Oh, uh...

19:42.281 --> 19:43.544
we're from Milwaukee.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.448
Oh. Couple farm boys, huh?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.577
Excuse me, ladies.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.557
You're very lucky
I ain't a farm boy.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.320
I'd have to rotate your crops.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.123
Uh, I-in actuality, see, uh...

19:58.264 --> 20:01.063
I'm a journalist and Fonzie here
is an ex-garage mechanic

20:01.200 --> 20:03.328
who is now going to be
the new James Dean.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.959
James Dean?

20:05.104 --> 20:06.697
A grease monkey?

20:06.839 --> 20:09.069
How'd you like me
to remove your clutch?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.370
Fonz, take it easy, because
he's Nancy's cousin, he...

20:11.511 --> 20:13.309
Well, actually,
we're only second cousins.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.847
- Nancy. -I'm kidding, guys.
You don't want to fight.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.713
Yeah, Nancy's right.
Fighting's kid stuff.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.580
Let's settle this
in a manly way.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.621
- Hey, you get a man,
I'll settle it. -(giggling)

20:23.756 --> 20:25.622
How about a little contest?

20:25.758 --> 20:28.750
You get some water skis,
and we'll run the slalom course.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.454
(clears throat) Fonz?

20:30.596 --> 20:31.859
Those patches on his shirt--

20:31.998 --> 20:34.126
those come from winning
water-ski contests.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.599
Rest easy, Cunningham.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.898
Okay, then. The slalom.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.528
Tomorrow afternoon.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.141
Be here at 1:00 sharp.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.677
My cousin's good.
Can your friend ski?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.283
(laughs) The Fonz?

20:50.416 --> 20:51.474
Can he water-ski?

20:51.617 --> 20:52.982
Ha!

20:53.119 --> 20:54.917
Can you water-ski?

20:55.054 --> 20:58.547
<i>FONZIE: You'll see, <i>Cunningham,
but first thing's first.</i></i>

21:01.027 --> 21:03.121
Hey, everybody, here's
the sticks for the hot dogs.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.457
Where'd you get those?

21:04.597 --> 21:05.792
They're what's left
of my surfboard.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.161
I finally caught a wave.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.324
(laughter)

21:08.467 --> 21:11.926
-(guitar strums)
- Here, pass them around.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.199
GIRL:
Hey, can I have one?

21:14.340 --> 21:16.240
- FONZIE: Little warm over here.
- MAN: Grab one.

21:16.375 --> 21:19.003
(guitar softly strumming)

21:22.114 --> 21:24.446
Oh, Howard,
isn't the beach wonderful?

21:24.584 --> 21:26.052
Mm-hmm.

21:26.185 --> 21:29.519
Especially since I don't have to
chase after your hat anymore.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.722
- Oh, Howard, you're so romantic.
- Mmm.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.487
I'll tell you something:

21:35.628 --> 21:38.757
I really love
this California life.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.265
You want a marshmallow?

21:41.400 --> 21:42.663
You mean you're staying?

21:42.802 --> 21:44.065
What, are you kidding?

21:44.203 --> 21:46.865
After tomorrow, when I take care
of this simple screen test,

21:47.006 --> 21:49.236
I'm gonna be here forever.
(chuckles)

21:49.375 --> 21:50.399
Really? That's terrific.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.840
You think that's terrific?

21:51.978 --> 21:54.345
I'll show you something
terrific-- around my lip area.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.606
-(9i9gles)
- Hey.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.810
Let's walk.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.250
I don't like crowds. Do you?

22:02.388 --> 22:03.685
Oh. Oh, no.
