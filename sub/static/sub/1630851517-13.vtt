onYoung Sheldon...

00:03.307 --> 00:05.092
Here we are.What is this?

00:05.135 --> 00:06.093
The dorm room.

00:06.136 --> 00:07.964
It's all yours.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.488
Now you can study, take naps,
do whatever you want.

00:10.532 --> 00:11.794
No one's living here?

00:11.837 --> 00:13.970
Well, we had
an Indian exchange student,

00:14.014 --> 00:15.798
but he developed a taste
for barbecue,

00:15.841 --> 00:18.279
so his parents made him go home.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.455
Wait, he has a room
here and at school?

00:20.498 --> 00:23.066
You have your own room.
I never had that growing up.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.982
And then I was in the barracks,
and then I married your mother.

00:26.026 --> 00:26.983
[chuckles]:Dang.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.289
Yeah, tell me about it.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.160
What happened to
appreciating what you have?

00:30.204 --> 00:31.901
Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah.

00:31.944 --> 00:34.295
Wait, you have a single?Uh-huh.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.731
And you don't
even sleep here?

00:35.774 --> 00:36.949
Well, sometimes
I take naps,

00:36.993 --> 00:39.039
but that mattress
is lumpy, lumpy.

00:40.214 --> 00:42.477
ADULT SHELDON:
I was learning to enjoy

00:42.520 --> 00:44.348
the perks of university life,

00:44.392 --> 00:47.047
including a dorm
to study and nap in.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.092
And since this was college,

00:49.136 --> 00:52.487
I was even allowed to have girls
in my room.

00:52.530 --> 00:54.402
Here we go. Nice and clean.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.665
Did you use
the unscented detergent?

00:56.708 --> 00:58.841
You've got a nose.
Sniff it yourself.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.323
ADULT SHELDON:
I even had my own bathroom,

01:02.366 --> 01:04.673
which gave me the perfect place
to store

01:04.716 --> 01:06.675
my impressive collection
of sunscreens

01:06.718 --> 01:08.111
and bug repellents.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.766
However, one thing
I would never get used to

01:10.809 --> 01:15.249
was college students' love
of blasting rock and roll music.

01:37.445 --> 01:38.794
Oh, you're that smart kid.

01:38.837 --> 01:39.882
Who is it?

01:39.925 --> 01:41.057
That smart kid.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.754
Tell him to come in.Want to come in?

01:42.798 --> 01:45.192
No, I'm here to complain.He's here to complain.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.063
Then don't let him in.You can't come in.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.935
I'm trying to study, and your
loud music is very distracting.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.807
You mean the game?"The game"?

01:51.850 --> 01:54.244
I'm not up
on today's one-named pop stars.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.593
No. It's a video game.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.291
You have video games?

01:57.334 --> 01:58.553
A bunch. You play?

01:58.596 --> 02:01.208
My meemaw and I
beat Quest of Adeera.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.644
Dude, this kid beat Adeera.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.776
Well, tell him to come in.Come in.

And they let you

02:21.619 --> 02:22.794

02:22.838 --> 02:24.666
That room's just for
during the day to study.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.276
Didn't I see some
lady in there?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.756
That must've been my mom.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.105
Dude, his mom is hot.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.673
What is wrong with you?
Don't listen to him.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.762
He thinks any female
with a pulse is hot.

02:33.805 --> 02:34.980
I don't think yourmom is hot.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.113
Congratulations,
you're more mature than him.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.594
Don't feel bad. I'm more
mature than most people.

09:03.325 --> 09:06.110
What in the hell
were you thinking

09:06.154 --> 09:08.765
punting with a minute 24
on the clock?

09:08.809 --> 09:10.332
That's a fair question.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.205
Sure is.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.294
That was a tough one.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.253
But our offense was
giving up 30 pounds

09:18.296 --> 09:19.820
to everyone across the line.

09:19.863 --> 09:24.346
And we had a quarterback who had
an uneasy relationship

09:24.389 --> 09:28.350
with... with holding onto
the ball.

09:29.394 --> 09:30.787
So you're blaming our kids?

09:30.831 --> 09:31.788
Well...
No.

09:31.832 --> 09:32.789
No?
No.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.051
No.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.487
Look, they're great kids.
A lot of heart.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.968
They were getting killed
out there.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.318
It's a coach's job
to know when to pull back.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.059
So your strategy is
to surrender.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.192
That's not what I'm saying.You know who don't surrender?

09:44.235 --> 09:46.150
That new coach they got
up at Carthage.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.588
You know he played
for the Packers.Mm-hmm.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.546
Oh, come on.
He played for two minutes

09:50.590 --> 09:52.504
and broke his collarbone,
and that was his career.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.028
Well, that's two minutes more
than you played.

09:54.071 --> 09:56.160
[laughter]

09:56.204 --> 09:57.205
Help me.

09:58.685 --> 10:01.383
Vince Lombardi never played
for the pros.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.211
So now this clown is
Vince Lombardi?

10:03.254 --> 10:06.170
[laughter]

10:06.214 --> 10:08.433
I'm not Lombardi, but I don't
need to put up with this crap.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.000
Wait, what I think
we're all seeing

10:10.044 --> 10:11.828
is the passion

10:11.872 --> 10:13.569
that Coach Cooper brings
to the field.No, what you're seeing

10:13.613 --> 10:15.832
is me running out of patience.
Meeting's over.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.529
Oh, there it is.

10:17.573 --> 10:20.184
The Cooper Surrender.[laughter]

10:20.228 --> 10:22.578
The Cooper Surrender!Bye-bye.

Everything.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.875
I was wearing
the new skirt,

10:58.919 --> 11:00.268
and I felt really good.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.052
Cute skirt.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.488
Thanks.

11:03.532 --> 11:06.274
Your legs are so hairy.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.756
Ew.Gross.

11:09.799 --> 11:13.107
Those bitches.
Thank you.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.762
Is that why you got on
sweat pants?

11:15.805 --> 11:18.068
It gets worse.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.070
Oh, boy.

11:20.114 --> 11:22.899
I came home, and I was
in the bathroom,

11:22.943 --> 11:24.901
and I saw Mom's leg razor.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.511
Oh, no. Please tell me

11:26.555 --> 11:28.078
you also saw shaving cream.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.254
I didn't.
Soap?

11:30.298 --> 11:33.431
Water? Lotion?

11:33.475 --> 11:34.998
Anything?

11:38.785 --> 11:40.003
[knock on door]

11:40.047 --> 11:42.614
Hey, it's Darren.

11:44.573 --> 11:45.748
Hello.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.837
Any chance you play
Dungeons and Dragons?

11:47.881 --> 11:50.187
And how. I once created
a campaign

11:50.231 --> 11:53.451
set in 1940s London where
Alan Turing was a character,

11:53.495 --> 11:55.453
and I had the mathematicians
be magic users

11:55.497 --> 11:57.107
with theorems instead of spells.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.500
The intelligence officers
were clerics...

11:58.543 --> 12:00.371
"Yes" works. We're playing
tonight and we're down

12:00.415 --> 12:01.764
a magic user.You in?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.374
When are you playing?

12:03.418 --> 12:04.767
We start at 7:00.
We'll go till whenever.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.204
My mom didn't let me stay
past 6:00 yesterday.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.816
She'll never let me stay
till "whenever."Bummer.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.861
Mm. you could play
at my house.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.124
No.Bummer.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.213
I've never said that before.
Did it sound cool?

12:16.257 --> 12:18.694
No.Bummer.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.702
Oh, before you open that,
could you pick up Sheldon

12:26.746 --> 12:29.052
so I can get dinner on?Do I have to?

12:29.096 --> 12:32.534
I'm sorry. I guess I'll do
all the parenting around here.

12:32.577 --> 12:35.667
I'm having a hell of a day.
Can I get five minutes' peace?

12:35.711 --> 12:37.844
When do I get
five minutes' peace?

12:37.887 --> 12:40.803
Honestly, can you just take
this one thing off my plate?

12:40.847 --> 12:42.979
[phone ringing]

12:45.634 --> 12:46.983
Hello?

12:47.027 --> 12:48.811
Dad, my friends are playing
Dungeons and Dragons.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.552
Can I please stay the night
in my dorm room?

12:50.595 --> 12:51.858
I promise it's safe.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.729
Fine with me.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.949
Thank you. Bye.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.994
That was easy.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.996
Who was that?
Sheldon.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.258
He's gonna stay the night
in his dorm.

13:01.302 --> 13:03.739
Why would you let him do that?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.349
One more thing
off your plate.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.618
You did not just
tell our son

13:13.662 --> 13:15.707
that he could stay the night
by himself.

13:15.751 --> 13:18.667
The campus is safe, and he's not
by himself, he's with friends.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.625
Friends that we don't know.

13:20.669 --> 13:21.975
What if there is alcohol?

13:22.018 --> 13:24.064
Then they're gonna get
a lot of fun facts

13:24.107 --> 13:25.848
about the history
of fermented beverages.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.676
I am serious.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.504
So am I.
How else would I know

13:29.547 --> 13:30.766
that monkeys get drunk
by eating rotten fruit

13:30.810 --> 13:32.028
off the jungle floor?

13:32.072 --> 13:35.031
He is not ready for
this kind of situation.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.772
Mary, he's a good kid.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.252
He's not gonna drink
anything he shouldn't.

13:38.295 --> 13:39.862
And if he cared
about peer pressure,

13:39.906 --> 13:41.081
he wouldn't wear a bow tie.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.694
I don't know.
I don't think I should.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.348
It's just root beer.

13:47.391 --> 13:50.090
This late in the evening,
my mother wouldn't approve.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.874
Okay.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.267
Then again, I didn't think
they'd let me stay,

13:53.310 --> 13:55.747
and they did,
so maybe it's fine.I know,

13:55.791 --> 13:58.838
why don't you roll for it?Ooh, good idea.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.189
Seventeen.
Guess I'll have it.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.454
We playing?

14:06.497 --> 14:08.064
Hold on.
Do you have a coaster?

14:08.108 --> 14:10.197
Yeah, it's in the china cabinet.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.026
And where would that be?

14:14.941 --> 14:17.247
You're good at Band-Aids.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.989
I've had practice
on Sheldon.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.209
He's a fragile boy.

14:22.252 --> 14:25.734
I don't want to go
back to school tomorrow.You have to!

14:25.777 --> 14:28.389
You can't let them win.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.912
But wear pants.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.305
This is hard to look at.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.915
I heard women in Europe
don't shave.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.482
Maybe I should move there.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.049
They also drink warm beer.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.833
They don't know
what they're doing.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.097
Will you show me how
to do it the right way?

14:41.141 --> 14:42.925
Shave? Yeah.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.232
Drink? Your dad's the expert.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.886
Boys have it so easy.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.583
They can be as hairy
as they want.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.541
Yeah, but they gotta
walk around being dumb

14:50.585 --> 14:51.542
and smelly all the time.

14:51.586 --> 14:52.935
Who wants that?

14:52.979 --> 14:54.415
So I have to shave forever,

14:54.458 --> 14:56.243
then marry someone
who's dumb and smelly?

14:56.286 --> 14:58.941
Not necessarily, but...

14:58.985 --> 15:00.595
there's a good chance.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.292
That's depressing.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.164
That's where the
drinking comes in.

15:07.602 --> 15:08.690
Where you going?

15:08.733 --> 15:10.648
To get our son.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.955
Mary, leave him alone.
He's fine.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.957
We have no idea
who he's with,

15:15.001 --> 15:16.480
and you don't even care.

15:16.524 --> 15:20.006
You're right.
Do whatever you want.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.659
What is your problem?

15:21.703 --> 15:23.139
Doesn't matter.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.012
Hey.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.448
[sighs]

15:27.491 --> 15:32.279
If something is
going on, tell me.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.282
[sighs]

15:35.325 --> 15:37.023
They're coming after me at work.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.807
Who?

15:38.850 --> 15:42.332
The boosters.
They want a new coach.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.467
Are you getting fired?

15:46.510 --> 15:50.601
I don't know. Maybe.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.044
Don't you have to go?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.359
I'm sorry.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.417
Thank you.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.772
"You open the gate of the crypt,

16:30.815 --> 16:32.730
and you see two identical
elven princesses."

16:32.774 --> 16:34.341
Sheldon, what do you do?

16:34.384 --> 16:37.213
I-I don't feel so good.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.301
What's going on?

16:38.345 --> 16:40.173
My stomach hurts.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.565
How much did you eat?

16:41.609 --> 16:43.306
Well...

16:49.051 --> 16:50.009
Dude.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.836
I need to lie down.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.360
[groans]

16:53.403 --> 16:54.839
Oh, I don't want to
throw up.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.276
We don't want you
to throw up.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.147
If he throws up, I throw up.Well, what should we do?

16:58.191 --> 16:59.540
I don't know.
Why are you asking me?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.063
You're the closest
to a mom here.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.499
I don't know.
Call his mom.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.892
Oh, no, don't call my mom.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.850
She'll never let me
do this again.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.504
[groaning]Get him something
to throw up in.

17:08.592 --> 17:09.898
No, not the Skittles.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.032
Here, here.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.468
Here.

17:14.511 --> 17:17.253
Next door there's an emergency
Alka-Seltzer tablet

17:17.297 --> 17:18.863
in my bathroom medicine chest.

17:18.907 --> 17:19.864
You have a bathroom?

17:19.908 --> 17:21.083
Why does he get a bathroom?

17:21.127 --> 17:22.389
Go throw up in
your own bathroom.

17:22.432 --> 17:25.392
I don't know if I can make it.
[groans]

17:27.220 --> 17:30.527
[Sheldon groaning]Get his door!

17:30.571 --> 17:31.702
It's locked.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.443
Key.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.054
I'm not gonna make it.Please make it.

17:35.097 --> 17:38.231
What is going on?
Sheldon, are you okay?

17:38.274 --> 17:39.580
My stomach hurts.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.408
He's gonna throw up.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.888
Did you give him beer?
Did they give you beer?!

17:43.932 --> 17:44.976
SHELDON:
Just root beer.

It's gonna be okay, baby.
