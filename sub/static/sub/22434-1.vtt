it's his mission in life

Can we do that again?

23:03.692 --> 23:04.452
No, thanks.

23:05.832 --> 23:09.422
The only difference between
a saint and a sinner

23:09.457 --> 23:13.150

young, didn't he?

24:12.658 --> 24:13.866
- That's right.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.833
He used to take on
kids from the home.

24:17.041 --> 24:18.767
Give us jobs when
no one else would.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.083
- Taught you
everything he knows.

24:27.535 --> 24:28.363
- I suppose so.

24:31.642 --> 24:33.299
- What did you do for him?

24:33.333 --> 24:34.231
- He found people.

24:36.026 --> 24:37.372
And he was very good at it.

24:39.788 --> 24:40.617
- Is that right?

24:41.894 --> 24:42.722
- Yeah.

24:46.346 --> 24:49.522
- Tell me, are you
sorry for what you did?

24:51.869 --> 24:52.698
- Yeah, I am.

24:55.632 --> 24:58.255
- Last week she left
and took her things.

24:59.463 --> 25:00.291
- Why?

25:02.259 --> 25:03.640
- She's troubled.

25:03.674 --> 25:04.744
She's 16.

25:06.574 --> 25:08.817
Police say she's an adult.

25:08.852 --> 25:10.992
- Can't send any of my
boys to look for her.

25:11.026 --> 25:14.823
If word gets out she's
attached me, bad all around.

25:14.858 --> 25:16.376
You they won't remember.

25:17.274 --> 25:18.758
- Any idea where she might be?

25:21.002 --> 25:23.142
- She has a boyfriend
called Alex.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.628
Don't know anything about him.

25:28.699 --> 25:29.976
Other than he's bad news.

25:43.300 --> 25:45.198
You think she's streetwise.

25:45.233 --> 25:47.718
Kids that age do, but she not.

25:48.892 --> 25:50.514
He thought we were
fools taking her on

25:50.549 --> 25:51.860
and she was a bad seed.

25:54.345 --> 25:55.864
At eight years old,
you've not had a chance

25:55.899 --> 25:57.072
to be good or bad.

25:59.212 --> 26:02.008
None of us are born bad, are we?

26:06.219 --> 26:08.877
[ominous music]

26:40.840 --> 26:41.669
- My brother.

26:43.912 --> 26:47.019
- What's really going on?
- He wants her back.

26:47.053 --> 26:50.263
- What's the story, to try
it on with her or something?

26:50.298 --> 26:52.093
- My brother's many things.

26:52.127 --> 26:53.957
A hypocrite in many ways, yes.

26:53.991 --> 26:56.822
Me and a few back unders, yes.

26:56.856 --> 26:57.685
But not that.

27:17.877 --> 27:18.947
- Not tonight, mate.

27:21.985 --> 27:23.503
How are you, brother?

27:23.538 --> 27:24.643
- Yeah, good, man,
how you doing?

27:24.677 --> 27:25.851
- Yeah, good to see you.

27:25.885 --> 27:28.232
How long you been out?
- A couple of weeks.

27:28.267 --> 27:29.855
- No kidding, you're
not missing much.

27:29.889 --> 27:31.442
- [Marley] Yeah, seems like it.

27:32.996 --> 27:33.790
- What's up, then?

27:33.824 --> 27:34.722
- Looking for someone.

27:34.756 --> 27:35.895
Kid called Alex.

27:35.930 --> 27:36.758
And the girl.

27:37.966 --> 27:39.416
- Alex.

27:39.450 --> 27:42.557
Could be Alex Gates,
AKA Honey Monster.

27:42.591 --> 27:43.420
Why?

27:44.732 --> 27:47.769
- I'll tell you
next time I see you.

27:47.804 --> 27:49.253
- You about working with
Brendan again, aren't you?

27:49.288 --> 27:50.772
- I'll tell you next time
I see you, all right?

27:50.807 --> 27:53.119
- What the fuck are
you doing that for?

27:55.639 --> 27:58.435
Alex hangs about with a nasty
bit of worker called Daws.

27:59.436 --> 28:00.575
- Where's this Daws hang about?

28:00.609 --> 28:03.026
- Strip joint called Extasia.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.199
- What about this Alex?

28:05.166 --> 28:06.063
Know where he lives?

28:06.098 --> 28:07.133
- Flat above the Derad Arms.

28:08.203 --> 28:09.895
- Is he a dealer?

28:09.929 --> 28:10.999
- Look for the shoes.

28:12.173 --> 28:14.382
- All right, thanks.

28:14.416 --> 28:15.659
- Listen, look after yourself.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.419
Give me a shout if
you need anything.

28:17.454 --> 28:18.973
- [Marley] Will do.

28:19.007 --> 28:21.769
[sirens blaring]

28:23.287 --> 28:25.462
[tapping]

28:30.639 --> 28:33.125
[tense music]

28:43.549 --> 28:44.757
[knocking]

28:44.792 --> 28:47.242
[baby crying]

28:47.277 --> 28:50.936
- Excuse me, what do
you think you're doing?

29:00.221 --> 29:02.119
- I met her in a
takeaway in Liddards.

29:03.569 --> 29:07.090
But she'd run away, like, she
was spooky but I liked her.

29:07.124 --> 29:08.298
- Spooky.

29:08.332 --> 29:10.714
- Yeah, you know, like
not quite with it.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.785
She was restless and that.

29:12.820 --> 29:14.062
She never slept.

29:14.097 --> 29:17.479
So I gave her some money
for some food and that.

29:17.514 --> 29:20.206
Said she could stay at
my place for a while.

29:20.241 --> 29:22.795
She'd run away from like a
foster home or something.

29:22.830 --> 29:24.486
She didn't want
to talk about it.

29:25.522 --> 29:26.316
- And where is she?

29:26.350 --> 29:27.179
- No idea.

29:28.974 --> 29:30.423
Why does anyone even care, man?

29:30.458 --> 29:32.598
She's just another fuck up
from a kid's home, ain't she?

29:34.013 --> 29:36.705
[grunting]

29:36.740 --> 29:37.776
Fucking hell.

29:47.751 --> 29:50.616
Do you know who Carl Daws is?

29:50.650 --> 29:52.307
- Yeah, I've heard of him.

29:52.342 --> 29:55.069
- All right, well I
deal for him, yeah.

29:55.103 --> 29:55.966
And I got robbed.

29:57.105 --> 29:58.831
He wasn't very
reasonable about it.

30:00.246 --> 30:02.179
He said he wanted security,
so I gave him Christina

30:02.214 --> 30:04.388
for a bit while I get
the cash together.

30:04.423 --> 30:06.528
- [Marley] How much
is Daws into you for?

30:06.563 --> 30:07.391
- 5G.

30:09.359 --> 30:10.705
- All right.

30:10.739 --> 30:12.707
And he's got her at Extasia.

30:12.741 --> 30:14.502
- Yeah, she's
upstairs locked up.

30:18.126 --> 30:19.369
- Got yourself
into some deep shit

30:19.403 --> 30:21.198
with someone very nasty.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.614
Much nastier than Daws,
do you understand that?

30:26.445 --> 30:30.207
But if you help me,
I can help you back.

30:31.346 --> 30:33.279
- What do I have to do?

30:34.556 --> 30:36.144
- For the time being,
keep your mouth shut.

30:37.387 --> 30:38.215
- OK.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.841
- Get out of the car.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.675
[engine starting]

30:55.267 --> 30:58.960
[banjo playing, dog barking]

[baby crying]

31:52.945 --> 31:55.396
[phone ringing]

31:55.430 --> 31:58.261
Hello?
- Listen, I've got news.

31:58.295 --> 32:01.091
They're gonna sell her.
- How much?

32:02.679 --> 32:03.956
- [Man] A grand.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.064
- Tell him you've got a buyer.
- OK.

32:08.098 --> 32:08.927
I'll take you tonight.

32:11.205 --> 32:13.862
[ethereal music]

32:28.947 --> 32:31.363
[chattering]

32:41.373 --> 32:42.961
- That's us, all of us.

32:44.652 --> 32:46.930
Dad was an evil old
bastard, right enough.

32:48.380 --> 32:49.208
This way.

32:51.486 --> 32:53.730
[coughing]

32:59.046 --> 33:01.910
- The tragedy of life is,

33:01.945 --> 33:03.567
it's not the
beautiful die young,

33:04.534 --> 33:06.570
but they get old and mean.

33:08.262 --> 33:10.264
Never get old, Marley,
it's not worth it.

33:13.681 --> 33:14.509
You have news.

33:15.441 --> 33:16.442
- Yeah, I found her.

33:18.548 --> 33:20.274
Alex is using her as
a marker with a code

33:20.308 --> 33:22.000
to Carl Daws who
he owes money to.

33:23.208 --> 33:26.004
- You know this Daws?
- I do.

33:26.038 --> 33:29.041
He's a tool rag.
- How much does he owe?

33:29.076 --> 33:29.938
- Five grand.

33:32.527 --> 33:34.736
- Do they know who she is?

33:36.221 --> 33:38.809
- No.
- Where is she?

33:40.777 --> 33:42.261
- Daws has got her
locked up at his club.

33:43.642 --> 33:45.023
I need a grand to get her back.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.231
- He's a pimp.

33:46.265 --> 33:48.026
He'll sell her to
the highest bidder.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.029
Can you trust him?

33:54.032 --> 33:55.171
- Yeah, I think so.

33:55.205 --> 33:57.897
- Just get her back to me.

34:11.428 --> 34:13.085
- How'd you find her?

34:13.982 --> 34:15.605
- Alex told me where she was.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.054
- Rough him up a bit, did ya?

34:18.918 --> 34:20.092
Jamie's dying, you know.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.994
He's a repentant old man,
slightly deluded, in my opinion,

34:26.029 --> 34:26.891
but there you go.

34:28.342 --> 34:30.998
You're fighting this good
fight, Marley, my son.

34:31.034 --> 34:33.967
If you have to kick a few
heads around to get her back,

34:34.002 --> 34:36.695
I'd say that's all in a good
cuntin' cause, wouldn't you?

34:39.663 --> 34:41.009
- See you later.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.565
[tense music]

35:33.752 --> 35:34.649
- Let's go.

36:18.072 --> 36:20.557
[tense music]

36:41.233 --> 36:43.960
[dramatic music]

37:08.087 --> 37:08.916
- Yeah.

37:12.471 --> 37:14.991
- This is the guy
I told you about.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.682
- Are you familiar?

37:16.717 --> 37:17.994
- No, I don't think so.

37:18.028 --> 37:19.340
- Sit down.

37:19.375 --> 37:20.307
Get yourself comfy.

37:22.861 --> 37:25.001
- Alex says you
got a girl for me.

37:25.035 --> 37:26.071
- Show me the cash.

37:37.324 --> 37:38.186
- One G.

37:40.534 --> 37:41.362
- Fetch her.

38:04.730 --> 38:05.524
She all right?

38:07.802 --> 38:08.631
- Yeah.

38:11.254 --> 38:12.082
10,000.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.084
- What?

38:15.293 --> 38:16.604
- 10,000 pounds.

38:17.916 --> 38:19.400
First was just a down payment.

38:23.370 --> 38:24.578
- You know who she is?

38:24.612 --> 38:26.269
- I do?

38:26.304 --> 38:27.477
I don't give a fuck, mate.

38:36.659 --> 38:37.625
- Silent.

38:37.660 --> 38:38.695
Put it down now, now.

38:41.974 --> 38:43.251
You've got your grand.

38:43.286 --> 38:44.114
I'm taking her.

38:48.464 --> 38:50.224
- You fucking muppet.

38:53.745 --> 38:58.232
- Stay there.

38:58.266 --> 38:59.785
Move.

38:59.820 --> 39:02.132
Fucking stay, move move move.

39:02.167 --> 39:02.995
Get in.

39:09.036 --> 39:11.210
[gasping]

39:22.014 --> 39:23.430
Jimmy sent me to pick you up.

39:25.570 --> 39:26.398
I'm taking you home.

39:31.610 --> 39:32.715
You cold or something?

39:35.269 --> 39:36.546
Do you want a cup of tea?

40:09.268 --> 40:10.200
Cup of tea.

40:19.175 --> 40:21.419
[grunting]

40:51.172 --> 40:53.968
[engine starting]

41:16.474 --> 41:17.302
Get up.

41:21.962 --> 41:22.790
Hey yo.

41:28.347 --> 41:30.142
- Not allowed to smoke
in there, apparently.

41:30.177 --> 41:31.834
Hello, Chrissie.

41:31.868 --> 41:33.145
She gave you trouble, eh?

41:34.906 --> 41:36.148
- Yeah.

41:36.183 --> 41:37.943
- You want to be careful.

41:37.978 --> 41:38.979
This man's get four.

41:42.327 --> 41:43.155
Come on.

41:50.646 --> 41:52.371
Come on, in you go.

41:53.407 --> 41:54.581
Here, take a seat.

41:55.582 --> 41:56.375
Come on, take a seat.

42:02.312 --> 42:04.729
- We've gone to a lot of
trouble to get you back.

42:07.110 --> 42:08.836
- Did you have any
trouble with Daws?

42:08.871 --> 42:09.665
- Not really.

42:11.598 --> 42:12.702
- Don't fucking move.

42:12.737 --> 42:14.911
- Are we sure about this now?

42:14.946 --> 42:16.154
- Positive.

42:16.188 --> 42:17.155
- Can we trust him?

42:22.609 --> 42:23.541
- She's got to go.

42:27.096 --> 42:28.649
- Jimmy.
- No, no, he's right.

42:28.684 --> 42:29.961
- She knows things.

42:32.273 --> 42:33.758
- She's just a fucking kid.

42:33.792 --> 42:36.277
- She's a proper pain in the
ass is what she fucking is.

42:38.659 --> 42:39.591
Here.

42:39.626 --> 42:41.213
In the heart, through the ribs.

42:41.248 --> 42:42.145
Keep it clean.

42:43.319 --> 42:45.079
Gaylord doesn't want
a mess on his rug.

42:49.359 --> 42:51.396
Stop lying to yourself.

42:51.430 --> 42:52.846
You're an evil bastard,
and that's nothing

42:52.880 --> 42:53.950
to be ashamed of.

42:57.022 --> 42:58.645
[tense music]

42:58.679 --> 42:59.784
You're my boy, Marley.

43:01.199 --> 43:02.027
Embrace it.

43:14.005 --> 43:15.593
- I'm not doing it.

43:23.497 --> 43:24.325
- Fine.

43:30.124 --> 43:32.161
Do you know who this
is, Chrissy, hmm?

43:33.472 --> 43:34.335
Remember him?

43:38.339 --> 43:40.618
That's the man that slit
your mommy's throat.

43:53.700 --> 43:55.391
[grunting]

43:55.425 --> 43:56.461
For fuck's sake.

43:56.495 --> 43:58.256
- No, no mess, nothing.

43:58.290 --> 44:00.776
- I know how to fucking do it.

44:01.708 --> 44:03.157
- Please, please.

44:05.056 --> 44:07.955
- Don't make it any harder
than it already is, sweetheart.

44:10.164 --> 44:12.719
[grunting]

44:12.753 --> 44:15.238
- That's enough.

44:15.273 --> 44:16.205
Let her go.

44:20.623 --> 44:21.555
- Come on.

44:21.589 --> 44:22.452
- Let her go.

44:27.250 --> 44:28.838
Cut her loose, now.

44:32.428 --> 44:33.256
Now.

44:34.948 --> 44:35.776
Put it down.

44:38.399 --> 44:39.607
You stay where you are.

44:45.406 --> 44:47.132
- You're making a
big mistake, pal.

44:48.651 --> 44:51.274
Good luck when I catch
up with you, yeah?

44:55.623 --> 44:57.108
Give me the knife,
give me the knife.

44:57.142 --> 44:58.385
Get in the car.

45:23.790 --> 45:24.652
I'm sorry.

45:27.621 --> 45:28.691
- Is that it?

45:34.076 --> 45:34.904
Why'd you do it?

45:38.425 --> 45:39.737
- I didn't mean to.

45:39.771 --> 45:40.910
- Yeah, so it was an accident.

45:48.849 --> 45:49.919
- I want to help you.

46:08.041 --> 46:08.869
Fuck.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.185
[tense music]

47:14.176 --> 47:16.661
[grunting]

47:16.695 --> 47:17.627
These meant for me?

47:19.595 --> 47:20.803
Put them on, you fucker.

47:33.920 --> 47:35.853
Now where's Alex,
and don't fuck about.

47:37.164 --> 47:37.993
- His place.

47:40.409 --> 47:42.135
- Where is he really?

47:55.942 --> 47:57.219
- For fuck's sake.

47:57.253 --> 47:59.462
- Tell Daws who Christina was?

47:59.497 --> 48:00.912
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

48:00.947 --> 48:01.775
Well done.

48:02.741 --> 48:04.295
- Well, does Brendan know?

48:04.329 --> 48:05.227
- What's she know?
- All right, there will be

48:05.261 --> 48:06.331
no need for that.

48:08.437 --> 48:09.921
Listen, Brendan gets a
cut of the club's earnings

48:09.956 --> 48:12.199
in return for
sorting the license.

48:12.234 --> 48:13.442
Daws hates that.

48:13.476 --> 48:15.444
It was my chance to
clear up the debt.

48:15.478 --> 48:16.824
- And why did they
want her dead?

48:16.859 --> 48:17.860
- Don't turn around.

48:21.346 --> 48:23.452
I'm tying up for Brendan.

48:23.486 --> 48:26.144
I've tidied up Daws and
now I'm tidying up him.

48:26.179 --> 48:28.388
- Oh, hang on a minute.
- Shut the fuck up.

48:29.976 --> 48:32.081
I told Brendan we want you dead.

48:33.669 --> 48:35.464
But you're a special
boy, aren't ya?

48:38.087 --> 48:40.503
You had enough time
convincing Jimmy, all right.

48:45.198 --> 48:46.613
Kill him.

48:46.647 --> 48:47.821
- Please, there are no issues.

48:47.855 --> 48:49.719
I'll show you, I'll
take you there.

48:49.754 --> 48:50.997
- No you don't.

48:54.552 --> 48:57.935
Come on, now, boy, he's an
annoying little shit anyway.

48:59.074 --> 49:00.799
What's he really got
to offer society?

49:02.318 --> 49:03.285
It's him or you.

49:05.114 --> 49:05.943
- Do it.

49:08.980 --> 49:10.326
Kill him.

49:10.361 --> 49:12.156
Kill the little shit now.

49:12.190 --> 49:13.812
Do it, kill him,
fucking kill him.

49:13.847 --> 49:14.710
Kill him now.

49:16.332 --> 49:18.956
[gun shooting]

49:22.580 --> 49:24.340
- Clean it up.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.894
Brendan needs to know
you're safe, understand?

49:28.482 --> 49:30.760
He needs reassurance
you're still his boy.

49:35.593 --> 49:37.698
[wiping]

49:46.673 --> 49:48.054
You're good at this, are ya?

49:51.643 --> 49:53.024
Hey.

49:53.059 --> 49:53.956
You missed a bit.

49:55.682 --> 49:57.684
There's a bit of eyeball
on some of the bollocks

49:57.718 --> 49:59.237
on the light switch over there.

50:03.862 --> 50:06.003
[whistling]

50:06.037 --> 50:09.558
You see him in that
position in prison?

50:09.592 --> 50:12.009
You probably learned it
in care homes, actually.

50:14.425 --> 50:16.013
I heard your mommy was a junkie.

50:17.911 --> 50:19.878
That why you got a thing
about women, is it?

50:21.535 --> 50:23.572
You find the little tart,
Brendan will let you live.

50:23.606 --> 50:24.711
You've got two days.

50:25.884 --> 50:27.369
I'll be looking
for her, as well.

50:28.991 --> 50:32.029
And I hope you find her
first now, don't you?

50:51.531 --> 50:54.154
[ominous music]

52:37.361 --> 52:41.054
[speaking foreign language]

53:38.284 --> 53:40.803
[oscillating]

53:42.702 --> 53:44.945
[grunting]

54:50.977 --> 54:51.978
- Christina.

54:53.635 --> 54:56.154
[tense music]

55:17.175 --> 55:20.075
[doorbell ringing]

55:27.531 --> 55:29.049
Hey there, is your mom in?

55:29.084 --> 55:29.947
- You mean Maura?

55:30.879 --> 55:31.707
- Yeah.

55:32.536 --> 55:33.364
- Maura.

55:37.368 --> 55:38.783
- Can I help you?

55:38.818 --> 55:40.923
- Yeah, I'm looking
for Christina Vedova.

55:40.958 --> 55:42.822
I think she may have been
in your care for a while.

55:42.856 --> 55:45.031
- Sorry, these are at risk kids.

55:45.065 --> 55:46.170
I can't discuss cases.

55:47.309 --> 55:48.759
- I'm her uncle.

55:49.898 --> 55:52.314
Please, look, her
grandmother's in bits.

55:53.729 --> 55:55.352
You know what the police are
like, they won't do anything.

55:57.457 --> 55:59.286
- She's out of my
hands, I'm afraid.

55:59.321 --> 56:01.565
Turn 16, and they're gone.

56:02.773 --> 56:05.223
- Any idea where she might be?

56:05.258 --> 56:06.949
She got any mates or?

56:06.984 --> 56:10.332
- She never settled here
really, to be honest with you.

56:10.367 --> 56:11.816
Bit of a loner, you know.

56:12.886 --> 56:15.130
Best you try social services.

56:15.164 --> 56:17.374
- Maura.
- All right.

56:17.408 --> 56:19.237
I'd like to help
you more, but sorry.

56:20.446 --> 56:21.274
- Thanks.

56:31.353 --> 56:33.838
[dog barking]

56:45.402 --> 56:47.887
[tense music]

56:59.174 --> 57:01.832
[paper tearing]

57:07.527 --> 57:08.425
- Found her yet?

57:11.117 --> 57:11.945
- Not yet.

57:18.607 --> 57:21.714
- Shamus here doesn't give a
fuck about anything or anyone.

57:23.301 --> 57:25.372
Frightens the Christ
out of me sometimes.

57:26.891 --> 57:27.685
But you.

57:31.724 --> 57:34.036
You're like Jimmy,
no stomach for it.

57:37.833 --> 57:38.662
Come here.

57:44.771 --> 57:47.360
This is your second chance,
there will be no third.

57:50.259 --> 57:51.468
Take your trousers down.

58:12.074 --> 58:12.903
You know.

58:14.698 --> 58:16.389
Your ma'am was gorgeous.

58:18.184 --> 58:20.186
Before she took to
the smack, that is.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.847
Last time I had to do
this, you were a kid, eh?

58:39.585 --> 58:41.414
You have one more day.

58:42.588 --> 58:43.416
Tomorrow.

58:44.762 --> 58:47.109
I'll be going up the middle.

58:49.767 --> 58:52.529
[ethereal music]

59:48.067 --> 59:50.034

[ominous music]

01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:26.726
- Come on, Judy.

01:00:27.693 --> 01:00:29.695
All right, Christine.

01:00:29.729 --> 01:00:30.937
Careful, bring your camera.

01:00:34.976 --> 01:00:36.909
You've been here a
while, haven't you?

01:00:36.943 --> 01:00:37.806
- Eight years.
- Blimey.

01:00:37.841 --> 01:00:39.636
That's a long time.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:43.053
What are you, 16?
- March, next year.

01:00:45.331 --> 01:00:48.023
- Look, seriously,
stop filming now.

01:00:48.058 --> 01:00:50.025
- Why?
- Just do it, yeah.

01:00:54.754 --> 01:00:56.722
- Where are you taking her?
- Well, you'll find out

01:00:56.756 --> 01:00:57.895
next year, won't you?

01:00:57.930 --> 01:00:59.207
Come on, we're late.

01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:00.484
You got your cake,
eat it in the car.

01:01:40.593 --> 01:01:41.732
Hello.

01:01:41.767 --> 01:01:43.182
It's OK.

01:01:43.216 --> 01:01:44.839
Just here to make sure
you're OK, all right, love?

01:01:49.015 --> 01:01:50.430
You all by yourself?

01:01:50.465 --> 01:01:51.293
- Yeah.

01:01:56.471 --> 01:01:58.093
- Have you run away?

01:02:01.856 --> 01:02:04.755
How old are you, love?
- 18.

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:07.240
- I'm not the police.

01:02:07.275 --> 01:02:08.069
- 16.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.728
- Look, I can take you
to an interim carer.

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:15.248
It's really nice there,
it's really safe, yeah?

01:02:18.079 --> 01:02:20.495
[chattering]

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:23.567
Come on.

01:02:24.913 --> 01:02:26.363
Just right there.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.711
[chattering]

01:02:35.303 --> 01:02:36.787
It's not that far.

01:02:37.823 --> 01:02:38.685
All right.

01:02:45.796 --> 01:02:47.487
Hey, Chrissie love.

01:02:47.522 --> 01:02:49.973
Maury says that you've gone

01:02:50.007 --> 01:02:51.837
and I was meant to take you

01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:53.252
to your new
accommodations today.

01:02:53.286 --> 01:02:54.667
Do you remember?

01:02:54.701 --> 01:02:56.842
Come on, you're 16 now.

01:02:56.876 --> 01:02:59.499
You know you can't live
at the home anymore.

01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:00.742
[beeping]

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:01.536
Come on, Christina,
this isn't funny.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.227
I'm really angry.

01:03:03.262 --> 01:03:05.195
Call me straight away and
tell me where you are.

01:03:05.229 --> 01:03:07.162
You're gonna be in a lot
of trouble if you don't.

01:03:08.267 --> 01:03:09.199
[beeping]

01:03:09.233 --> 01:03:10.441
Hey, Chrissie, it's me again.

01:03:10.476 --> 01:03:12.374
Look, we're all really
worried about you.

01:03:12.409 --> 01:03:13.859
Please call me.

01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:16.896
[beeping]

01:03:16.931 --> 01:03:19.726
Look, you stupid little
bitch, it's my fucking neck

01:03:19.761 --> 01:03:20.935
on the line.

01:03:20.969 --> 01:03:24.317
You better ring
me right now, OK?

01:03:24.352 --> 01:03:26.837
[tense music]

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.486

01:04:12.952 --> 01:04:15.817
[yelling]

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.336
- Get the fuck in.

01:04:46.296 --> 01:04:48.194
You supply kids to
Brendan, don't you?

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:52.095
And Christina was one of them.

01:04:54.545 --> 01:04:55.788
You told me Jimmy and
his wife adopted her

01:04:55.822 --> 01:04:58.032
when she was a kid, but
that's not true, is it?

01:04:59.171 --> 01:05:00.448
Is it?

01:05:00.482 --> 01:05:02.415
- No, it isn't.

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:03.278
It was me.

01:05:04.693 --> 01:05:06.937
- And where do the kids end up?

01:05:06.972 --> 01:05:09.629
- I don't know,
they don't tell me.

01:05:11.114 --> 01:05:11.942
- Tell me.

01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:16.257
- Jimmy's got people
in social services.

01:05:17.223 --> 01:05:19.398
The kids turn 16.

01:05:19.432 --> 01:05:20.813
Cases are closed.

01:05:20.847 --> 01:05:21.814
They disappear.

01:05:23.298 --> 01:05:25.542
Brendan's a supplier
for rich people.

01:05:27.095 --> 01:05:28.545
Perverts with cash.

01:05:28.579 --> 01:05:31.099
- There's some they keep
for themselves, don't they?

01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:33.101
- Yes.

01:05:33.136 --> 01:05:34.413
- Like Christina.

01:05:35.793 --> 01:05:36.622
- Jimmy.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.695
Wanted her from the start.

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:44.216
He used to come to the
home, give her presents.

01:05:46.011 --> 01:05:47.219
He watched her grow up.

01:05:48.047 --> 01:05:49.738
I'm sorry.

01:05:49.773 --> 01:05:51.361
Please.

01:05:51.395 --> 01:05:52.224
Please.

01:05:53.397 --> 01:05:55.468
[crying]

01:05:57.643 --> 01:05:58.471
Please.

01:06:00.094 --> 01:06:01.543
- Shut up.

01:06:01.578 --> 01:06:04.374
Shut up, be quiet, shut up.

01:06:06.479 --> 01:06:07.756
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:11.036
[shooting, grunting]

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:13.279
[shooting]

01:07:42.989 --> 01:07:46.027
- Too late, they've
already found her.

01:09:24.573 --> 01:09:26.817
[clinking]

01:10:10.896 --> 01:10:11.828
- Where is she?

01:10:45.379 --> 01:10:47.553
[beeping]

01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:10.266
[coughing]

01:11:19.102 --> 01:11:21.380
- She went peacefully.

01:11:21.415 --> 01:11:22.761
Most of them do.

01:11:26.351 --> 01:11:27.800
Most of the time.

01:11:29.802 --> 01:11:31.839
[coughing]

01:11:31.873 --> 01:11:33.323
That's where I keep them.

01:11:33.358 --> 01:11:36.982
Until I'm ready,
the killing part.

01:11:39.743 --> 01:11:41.676
I don't like looking
at their faces.

01:11:44.817 --> 01:11:45.646
Puts me off.

01:11:48.442 --> 01:11:51.099
They stay at the home
until they're of age.

01:11:51.134 --> 01:11:52.584
Have something of a life.

01:11:52.618 --> 01:11:53.516
- Where's Brendan?

01:11:55.863 --> 01:11:57.002
- He's waiting for you.

01:12:00.039 --> 01:12:00.868
- Where is he?

01:12:02.387 --> 01:12:04.630
- West Lake, it's
a children's home.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.771
