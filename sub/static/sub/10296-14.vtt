a horse and carriage *

00:24.801 --> 00:28.734
* This I tell ya, brother  *

00:28.734 --> 00:33.434
* You can't have one
Without the other *

00:33.434 --> 00:35.634
* Love and marriage *

00:35.634 --> 00:38.801
* Love and marriage *

00:38.801 --> 00:42.734
* It's an institute
You can't disparage *

00:42.734 --> 00:47.033
* Ask the local gentry *

00:47.033 --> 00:51.501
* And they will say
It's elementary *

00:51.501 --> 00:56.367
* Try, try, try
To separate them *

00:56.367 --> 01:00.100
* It's an illusion *

01:00.100 --> 01:06.767
* Try, try, try
And you will only come *

01:06.767 --> 01:08.634

What's the matter, Kel?

01:20.767 --> 01:23.133
Are the contractions
five minutes apart?

01:23.133 --> 01:24.801
What's the matter, Bud?

01:24.801 --> 01:27.501
Puberty five years away?

01:27.501 --> 01:29.501
Come on, Kel.
We're blood.

01:29.501 --> 01:31.501
If you've got a problem,
maybe I can help.

01:31.501 --> 01:34.334
Well, Mom and Dad are
at parent/teacher night,

01:34.334 --> 01:35.834
and I'm scared.

01:35.834 --> 01:39.601
You know, Mom and Dad
make me sick.

01:39.601 --> 01:42.267
When are they going to
realize you're stupid

01:42.267 --> 01:44.167
and leave you alone?

01:45.934 --> 01:48.934
Yuk it up, malignancy.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.934
No, I've got to
start doing better.

01:50.934 --> 01:52.434
I've got this
book report due,

01:52.434 --> 01:54.434
and I haven't even
read the book.

01:54.434 --> 01:56.100
 It's called
 <i>Robinson Crusoe.</i>

01:56.100 --> 01:57.634
Oh, I've read that.

01:57.634 --> 01:59.133
I can help you...

01:59.133 --> 02:01.400
For a small fee,
of course.

02:04.133 --> 02:05.634
Okay.

02:05.634 --> 02:09.133
Robinson Crusoe was
marooned on a desert island.

02:09.133 --> 02:12.968
The only people there
were him, Friday,

02:12.968 --> 02:18.133
The Professor,
Mary Ann, Ginger...

02:18.133 --> 02:19.667
And the rest.

02:19.667 --> 02:20.667
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

02:20.667 --> 02:21.667
Slow down. Slow down.

02:21.667 --> 02:22.868
The Professor...

02:25.300 --> 02:26.801
Right.

02:26.801 --> 02:28.667
Now, in the
first chapter,

02:28.667 --> 02:31.667
they had to get
around the island.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.167
So Gilligan--
I mean Robinson

02:33.167 --> 02:35.167
and The Professor
built a car

02:35.167 --> 02:36.434
that ran on coconuts.

02:36.434 --> 02:38.334
Oh, cool.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.033
You know,

02:44.033 --> 02:46.434
Robinson always sang
this little song

02:46.434 --> 02:47.934
around the island.

02:47.934 --> 02:52.434
You may want to do it
in front of the class.

02:52.434 --> 02:54.934
It shows
you read carefully.

02:54.934 --> 02:57.934
* Just sit right back
And you'll hear a tale *

02:57.934 --> 03:01.100
* A tale
Of a fateful trip *

03:01.100 --> 03:03.100
* That started
From this tropic port *

03:03.100 --> 03:06.968
* Aboard
This tiny ship *

03:06.968 --> 03:09.300
* The mate-- *
Now, that's Robinson--

03:09.300 --> 03:11.100
* Was a mighty
Sailing man *

03:11.100 --> 03:12.634
* The skipper
Brave and sure *

03:12.634 --> 03:14.801
* Five passengers
Set sail that day *

03:14.801 --> 03:16.501
* For a three-hour tour *

03:16.501 --> 03:19.300
* A three-hour tour **

03:19.300 --> 03:20.534
Twice?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.601
It's important.

[CAR APPROACHING]

03:27.400 --> 03:28.767
That's Mom and Dad.

03:28.767 --> 03:29.968
Come on,
we'll finish this later.

03:29.968 --> 03:31.567
Tell them that
I'm upstairs

03:31.567 --> 03:33.133
working really hard
on my report.

03:33.133 --> 03:35.601
I'm finally going to get an A!

03:37.033 --> 03:38.767
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

03:38.767 --> 03:39.801
Kelly said she's upstairs

03:39.801 --> 03:41.934
listening to the radio
and dancing.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.634
Ooh, you two
look pretty mad.

03:46.634 --> 03:47.934
But in Kelly's defense,

03:47.934 --> 03:49.767
wait till after she's turned in
her book report.

03:49.767 --> 03:51.267
We owe her that much.

03:51.267 --> 03:53.801
Kelly is not
the problem, Bud.

03:53.801 --> 03:58.133
She has moved up
to a good, solid D.

03:58.133 --> 04:00.133
Now, you're the one
who's in trouble.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.634
We went to your school and saw
your social studies report,

04:02.634 --> 04:06.801
you know, "Brazil, Land
of Rubber and Sunshine."

04:06.801 --> 04:08.734
Would you care to explain

04:08.734 --> 04:10.801
this picture of your sister
in a bikini?

04:13.968 --> 04:16.834
Well, it illustrates
the easy sex in Brazil.

04:16.834 --> 04:18.934
So how did I do?

04:18.934 --> 04:21.567
Like your father,
in life, you failed.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.400
Now, Bud,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.968
I want you to go upstairs,
and do not come back down

04:25.968 --> 04:29.334
until you figure out something
else to do with your time

04:29.334 --> 04:30.801
besides torturing
your sister.

04:30.801 --> 04:33.834
Why don't you just ask me
to stop breathing?

04:33.834 --> 04:36.834
It's what I am.
It's what I do.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.934
I tell you what, I'll help Kelly
with her homework.

04:38.934 --> 04:40.167
Good boy.

[HUMMING
 <i>GILLIGAN'S ISLAND</i> THEME]

04:45.200 --> 04:46.634
You know, Al,

04:46.634 --> 04:48.234
I think I know
what the problem is.

04:48.234 --> 04:49.634
He just has
too much free time.

04:49.634 --> 04:52.133
Now, what can we do
about that?

04:52.133 --> 04:56.601
Well, we could
get him a wife.

04:56.601 --> 04:58.801
I meant
like a hobby--

04:58.801 --> 05:00.300
you know,
a father/son thing,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.801
something he could
learn from you.

05:02.801 --> 05:06.968
Let's see.
You can't teach balding.

05:06.968 --> 05:09.467
He already knows how to go
to the bathroom,

05:09.467 --> 05:11.934
and he's too young
to drink.

05:11.934 --> 05:14.000
Gee, Peg, if you
wanted a hug,

05:14.000 --> 05:15.868
why didn't you
just ask for one?

[DOORBELL RINGS]

05:18.667 --> 05:21.667
It's us,
Steve and Marcie.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.200
Hurry!
It's important.

05:32.367 --> 05:34.868
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know these people?

05:36.367 --> 05:37.367
No.

05:37.367 --> 05:38.367
Al!

05:38.367 --> 05:39.434
Please.

05:39.434 --> 05:41.901
We picked them up
for soliciting

05:41.901 --> 05:43.400
at Joe's
cocktail lounge.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.901
I told you, officer,

05:44.901 --> 05:46.834
we were
just role-playing

05:46.834 --> 05:48.834
to spice up
our marriage.

05:48.834 --> 05:51.767
We lost our ID when we
were running from you.

05:51.767 --> 05:54.501
It's all a big mistake.
Tell him who we are, Al.

05:54.501 --> 05:58.534
Yeah, it's the neighbors--
the hooker and the sailor.

05:59.701 --> 06:01.033
I see.

06:01.033 --> 06:04.033
Just a little
yuppie game play, huh?

06:04.033 --> 06:08.534
Well, let me tell you
something about police.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.534
We don't like it
when you jerk us around.

06:10.534 --> 06:13.534
I could be out there
scaring kids

06:13.534 --> 06:16.033
or driving
with the siren on.

06:16.033 --> 06:19.534
So next time you want to put
some fun in your marriage,

06:19.534 --> 06:21.968
do what me and my wife do--

06:21.968 --> 06:23.501
cheat on each other.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.767
Oh, Marcie,
that's a nice outfit.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.267
Can I borrow it?

06:29.267 --> 06:31.501
I have a wedding to go to.

06:31.501 --> 06:33.734
May I use your phone?
I have to call a locksmith.

06:33.734 --> 06:36.000
I lost our keys
when Steve knocked me over

06:36.000 --> 06:38.868
running from
the squad car.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.200
So, what's new
with you guys?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.634
Well, we were just trying
to figure out a hobby for Bud,

06:45.634 --> 06:47.601
you know, to keep him
out of trouble...

06:47.601 --> 06:49.434
something
he could do with Al.

06:49.434 --> 06:50.667
Well, you guys

06:50.667 --> 06:52.434
could come over together
in the morning

06:52.434 --> 06:53.834
and steal my paper.

06:53.834 --> 06:56.234
No, my mornings
are for me.

06:56.234 --> 06:58.834
How about flying or polo?

06:58.834 --> 07:00.334
How about collecting
original Picassos?

07:00.334 --> 07:01.834
Hell, I make minimum wage.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.567
We can start with one
of his bad ones.

07:04.567 --> 07:07.133
They'll be over
in an hour.

07:07.133 --> 07:09.734
I'm sure
it will just fly by.

07:09.734 --> 07:10.767
You know, a hobby

07:10.767 --> 07:11.934
doesn't have
to be expensive.

07:11.934 --> 07:13.334
As a kid, I collected
baseball cards.

07:13.334 --> 07:14.467
You too?

07:14.467 --> 07:16.467
Yeah, I had
some great ones,

07:16.467 --> 07:18.968
but my mother
threw them all out.

07:18.968 --> 07:20.734
Yep. Mine too.

07:20.734 --> 07:21.701
Women.
Women.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.868
Greatest hobby in the world,
and women just don't get it.

07:25.868 --> 07:30.601
No, Al, what I just
don't get is sex.

07:30.601 --> 07:33.100
That's going to be
Bud's new hobby.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.667
Sex?

07:34.667 --> 07:36.167
No, baseball cards.

07:36.167 --> 07:37.934
Bud, come down here.

07:37.934 --> 07:40.934
Why don't you find Bud
something more cultural

07:40.934 --> 07:42.434
and intellectually
stimulating?

07:42.434 --> 07:43.934
Marcie, they're men.

07:43.934 --> 07:45.934
To them, something
intellectually stimulating

07:45.934 --> 07:48.868
is comparing
today's Elmer Fudd

07:48.868 --> 07:50.868
with the original,
fatter Fudd.

07:54.501 --> 07:55.968
Hey, he has lost weight,
hasn't he, Steve?

07:57.634 --> 08:00.033
It's like a totally
different Fudd, Al.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.968
Let's get some coffee,
Marce.

08:02.968 --> 08:05.200
What's up, Dad?

08:05.200 --> 08:08.300
Bud, I want to talk to you
about your new hobby.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.968
What's my new hobby, Dad?

08:09.968 --> 08:11.467
Collecting
baseball cards.

08:11.467 --> 08:14.467
How long have I had
this new hobby, Dad?

08:14.467 --> 08:15.968
About two
minutes, son.

08:15.968 --> 08:17.334
Do I like it?

08:18.868 --> 08:20.167
But you know
something, Bud?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.434
The players today
are kind of boring.

08:22.434 --> 08:25.434
When Al and I were young,
they were great.

08:25.434 --> 08:27.601
Yeah, and see, that's what
you're going to do, Bud.

08:27.601 --> 08:28.968
You're going to
collect cards

08:28.968 --> 08:30.534
from when we and Steve
were kids.

08:30.534 --> 08:32.100
You are going
to collect

08:32.100 --> 08:37.333
the all-time greatest
Cub team ever.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.200
Oh, man.

08:41.167 --> 08:45.501
Look at them over there.
Men are such idiots,

08:45.501 --> 08:49.367
and I married
their king.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.000
Baseball cards.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.968
I mean, what is
the big deal, anyway?

08:52.968 --> 08:55.534
It's just a bunch of guys
holding their bats.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.000
They ought to show
pictures of them

08:57.000 --> 08:58.334
the way they really are--

08:58.334 --> 09:00.667
Grabbing their privates,
spitting,

09:00.667 --> 09:02.501
and patting
each other on the butt

09:02.501 --> 09:03.801
for "good luck."

09:06.567 --> 09:08.200
I hate baseball.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.234
All the boys at school
loved baseball.

09:11.234 --> 09:13.234
I can still
hear them talking--

09:13.234 --> 09:14.734
"Baseball,
baseball, baseball.

09:14.734 --> 09:17.234
"Gee, there's Marcie.
Let's throw a rock at her.

09:17.234 --> 09:18.734
Baseball,
baseball, baseball."

09:18.734 --> 09:20.234
I hate men.

09:20.234 --> 09:21.734
They're stupid,
ignorant animals

09:21.734 --> 09:23.467
with stupid,
ignorant hobbies.

09:23.467 --> 09:24.968
They hated me...

09:24.968 --> 09:26.968
but I didn't
need them.

09:26.968 --> 09:28.334
I had Barbie.

09:30.934 --> 09:35.834
And I had a very special
bathtub toy.

09:39.634 --> 09:41.701
Who's Barbie?

09:41.701 --> 09:43.534
Who's Barbie?

09:43.534 --> 09:46.133
America's favorite
teenage fashion model,

09:46.133 --> 09:47.534
that's who.

09:47.534 --> 09:49.834
Oh, you mean
a Barbie doll.

09:49.834 --> 09:51.834
Yeah, I had one of those.

09:51.834 --> 09:54.334
I gave it
to my boyfriend Keith

09:54.334 --> 09:56.834
as a symbol
of our love.

09:56.834 --> 09:59.167
He was gay
as a debutante, you know?

09:59.167 --> 10:01.267
I still have
my Barbie.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.000
She's been wrapped up
safe and sound

10:03.000 --> 10:05.567
in her original box
for 20 years now,

10:05.567 --> 10:06.868
just waiting for the day

10:06.868 --> 10:08.901
when I can pass her on
to my little girl.

10:08.901 --> 10:11.267
Kelly had a bunch
of that Barbie stuff,

10:11.267 --> 10:13.267
but to tell you the truth,
I never understood

10:13.267 --> 10:14.801
the fascination
with Barbie.

10:14.801 --> 10:17.367
But I could sure
strip Ken with my teeth.

10:20.701 --> 10:23.634
Yes, I'm sure.

10:23.634 --> 10:25.367
But I loved Barbie.

10:25.367 --> 10:26.868
It was a way to escape.

10:26.868 --> 10:29.868
The whole idea was for
Barbie to live the life

10:29.868 --> 10:31.234
you wanted
for yourself.

10:38.934 --> 10:41.434
You know,
this really is fun.

10:41.434 --> 10:43.033
Hey, is there
such a thing

10:43.033 --> 10:44.434
as an old,
rich Ken doll

10:44.434 --> 10:47.067
that's about
to kick the bucket?

10:47.067 --> 10:50.567
That way my Barbie wouldn't
have to hide these Kens

10:50.567 --> 10:51.901
at 5:00

10:51.901 --> 10:54.634
when the Al doll comes
home from the shoe store.

10:54.634 --> 10:57.634
Barbie was meant to be
dressed beautifully

10:57.634 --> 10:59.133
and properly
accessorized,

10:59.133 --> 11:00.567
not to be lying around

11:00.567 --> 11:02.901
rubbed by a bunch
of horny Kens.

11:05.067 --> 11:07.067
Well, you've got
your accessories,

11:07.067 --> 11:10.501
and I've got mine.

11:10.501 --> 11:11.834
Hey, let's go downstairs

11:11.834 --> 11:14.501
and see what else of Kelly's
we can play with.

11:14.501 --> 11:15.601
Okay.

11:15.601 --> 11:17.501
And after we disinfect
your Barbie dream house,

11:17.501 --> 11:19.000
I'll get out my Barbie.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.868
I hope your Kens
can handle it.

11:22.901 --> 11:23.934
I can't believe it.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.868
Those old cards
are really expensive,

11:25.868 --> 11:27.701
but I sold everything
I could...

11:27.701 --> 11:29.868
but we got seven
of the nine all-time Cubs.

11:29.868 --> 11:31.868
What a great
store, huh?

11:31.868 --> 11:33.367
And a great
afternoon.

11:33.367 --> 11:35.601
Think we should have
taken Bud with us?

11:35.601 --> 11:38.200
Why? He'd only
get in the way.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.734
Yeah, you're right.

11:39.734 --> 11:43.701
Now, all he needs is
Ken Hubbs and Ernie Banks,

11:43.701 --> 11:45.200
and they're
pretty expensive.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.200
Great move, you selling
your wife's old doll.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.200
What, the old Barbie
in the basement?

11:50.200 --> 11:51.601
She'll never even
miss it.

11:56.901 --> 11:58.734
Bud, here's
the crowning jewel

11:58.734 --> 12:00.234
of your collection.

12:00.234 --> 12:01.501
I just got it.

12:01.501 --> 12:02.701
Don't touch it!

12:02.701 --> 12:05.067
Now, all you need
is Ernie Banks.

12:05.067 --> 12:07.067
I'm proud
of you, son.

12:07.067 --> 12:10.000
Well, I'm proud
of you too, Dad.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.033
You men
are such children.

12:12.033 --> 12:15.567
Now, where's
Barbie's pumps?

12:15.567 --> 12:18.868
I guess I'm the man
of the house now, eh, folks?

12:20.968 --> 12:24.634
Bud, I am going
to kill you.

12:24.634 --> 12:27.033
Oh, yeah, today
was book report day.

12:29.334 --> 12:30.601
How'd you do, Kel?

12:30.601 --> 12:32.133
How did I do?

12:32.133 --> 12:35.067
I had a meeting
with the principal,

12:35.067 --> 12:36.567
a three-hour meeting.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.234
A three-hour
meeting.

12:43.467 --> 12:46.467
You see, Bud,
you innocently mixed up

12:46.467 --> 12:49.467
 <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>
 and <i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

12:49.467 --> 12:50.968
I told them that,

12:50.968 --> 12:53.467
but the principal
didn't believe me.

12:53.467 --> 12:54.868
He just said,

12:54.868 --> 12:57.467
"Even you, Miss Bundy,
are not that stupid."

12:58.634 --> 13:02.968
But he was wrong,
wasn't he, Kel?

13:02.968 --> 13:05.634
Well, to make
a long story short,

13:05.634 --> 13:07.133
I'm a laughingstock,

13:07.133 --> 13:08.434
you are
going to die,

13:08.434 --> 13:11.000
and I'm suspended
until I do a report

13:11.000 --> 13:12.868
on all the work
of some guy named Poe.

13:12.868 --> 13:15.667
You mean like
"The Tell-tale Heart"?

13:15.667 --> 13:17.033
Yeah.

13:17.033 --> 13:19.501
You really
know that one?

13:19.501 --> 13:22.534
Well, sure.
It's the one with Cousin Itt.

13:24.634 --> 13:26.133
Really?

13:26.133 --> 13:27.667
Yeah, come on.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.801
I'll tell you
all about it.

13:29.801 --> 13:32.767
There really is
a song in this one.

13:32.767 --> 13:37.167
[SINGING <i>THE ADDAMS FAMILY</i>
THEME SONG]

13:39.033 --> 13:41.267
She may not graduate.
You know that, Peg?

13:42.734 --> 13:44.968
Steve, we've been robbed!

13:44.968 --> 13:46.901
They took my Barbie!

13:46.901 --> 13:48.868
Not the one you were saving
to give your daughter.

13:50.467 --> 13:53.133
And it was someone we know.
They went right for her.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.634
Steve, find them.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.834
Find them
and kill them.

13:56.834 --> 13:58.534
No, don't kill them.

13:58.534 --> 14:00.033
Bring them to me.

14:00.033 --> 14:02.167
I'll kill them.

14:02.167 --> 14:03.667
But not at first.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.667
First
I'll take a hammer

14:05.667 --> 14:08.667
and smash their toes,
little to big.

14:08.667 --> 14:13.033
Then, if it was a man--
and I know it was a man--

14:13.033 --> 14:17.000
I'll turn
the hammer around.

14:20.534 --> 14:21.701
Al...

14:24.067 --> 14:25.901
Steve, get the cops.

14:25.901 --> 14:27.167
Show them this.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.601
I dug up
this picture of her.

14:28.601 --> 14:32.734
It was taken the night
of her first date with Ken.

14:32.734 --> 14:35.167
Marcie, why don't you
come upstairs,

14:35.167 --> 14:38.167
lie down, and have a good cry
on my bed?

14:38.167 --> 14:42.067
God knows,
it's used to tears.

14:42.067 --> 14:44.667
Both sides, Peg.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.200
I'm in big trouble, Al.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.534
She'll never know
it was you.

14:52.534 --> 14:54.667
Steve,
they left a clue.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.167
I found a hair.

14:56.167 --> 14:58.167
It's just like
a fingerprint.

14:58.167 --> 14:59.667
No two are alike.

14:59.667 --> 15:01.167
We'll find him.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.667
We'll find him.

15:02.667 --> 15:03.834
Oh, yeah.

15:06.634 --> 15:09.534
I got to get
that doll back, Al.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.534
I'm going to call the guy
we sold it to.

15:12.534 --> 15:15.067
Remember, Kel--
"Quoth the raven...

15:15.067 --> 15:16.501
You rang?"

15:19.400 --> 15:21.667
Dad, you know, I haven't given
this baseball card thing

15:21.667 --> 15:23.133
a fair chance,

15:23.133 --> 15:25.534
so I'll have my friend Teddy
come over and check it out.

15:25.534 --> 15:27.033
Go ahead, Bud.
That's what they're here for.

15:29.501 --> 15:31.834
Like hell.
Get your own hobby.

15:31.834 --> 15:32.934
Al,

15:32.934 --> 15:35.067
The store was robbed.

15:35.067 --> 15:38.033
Barbie's gone,
and I'm a dead man.

15:38.033 --> 15:39.267
Oh, well.

15:39.267 --> 15:41.267
Here's a question
for you--

15:41.267 --> 15:45.534
In 1966, which Cub
had a 28-game hitting streak?

15:45.534 --> 15:46.968
Al, don't you understand?

15:46.968 --> 15:49.968
If I don't get
Marcie's doll back, I--

15:49.968 --> 15:51.300
28 games?

15:51.300 --> 15:52.467
'66?

15:52.467 --> 15:53.634
Billy Williams.

15:53.634 --> 15:54.868
Ron Santo.

15:54.868 --> 15:57.667
I was going to say
Ron Santo! Damn!

15:57.667 --> 15:59.234
Anyhow,

15:59.234 --> 16:01.467
the way I figure it,

16:01.467 --> 16:02.968
somebody
from the neighborhood

16:02.968 --> 16:04.467
broke into that store,

16:04.467 --> 16:08.467
which means that Barbie is
probably still in the area.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.534
Steve, you're not telling me

16:09.534 --> 16:10.667
that we're going to
comb the streets

16:10.667 --> 16:11.801
looking for a stupid
Barbie doll?

16:20.701 --> 16:23.200
[***]

18:15.267 --> 18:18.267
Well, some of
my teeth are loose,

18:18.267 --> 18:19.968
but we got her.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.667
Oh, Steve.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.567
That's not my Barbie.

18:26.567 --> 18:29.367
My Barbie has a little
crescent-shaped cut

18:29.367 --> 18:30.868
on heel
of her left foot.

18:30.868 --> 18:34.367
She got it jogging
on the beach with Ken.

18:34.367 --> 18:36.167
You don't love me!

18:40.033 --> 18:43.868
Al, those motorcycle
guys hurt me.

18:46.567 --> 18:48.033
I know they did.

18:51.067 --> 18:53.234
[***]

21:20.067 --> 21:22.601
Steve, you're the most
wonderful husband

21:22.601 --> 21:23.968
in the whole, wide world.

21:27.567 --> 21:28.901
Let's go home.

21:30.434 --> 21:33.601
Marcie, I think
I need a dentist.

21:33.601 --> 21:35.033
I'm seriously hurt here.

21:35.033 --> 21:37.033
Thank God
you're all right.

21:37.033 --> 21:38.200
What say tomorrow

21:38.200 --> 21:40.534
we dress you
in your red linen suit

21:40.534 --> 21:42.033
for the busy gal?

21:42.033 --> 21:43.534
Speaking of red,

21:43.534 --> 21:45.934
I'm bleeding
internally here.

21:45.934 --> 21:47.300
I'm so glad you're okay.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.234
I don't think they should
have children, Al.

21:55.033 --> 21:57.234
I don't think
anybody should.

22:01.067 --> 22:04.934
Mom, Dad, tomorrow
I'm turning in my report

22:04.934 --> 22:06.567
 on Poe's
"The Raven Family,"

22:06.567 --> 22:09.534
featuring Morticia,
Gomez, and Thing,

22:09.534 --> 22:12.534
but I've been working
really hard on this,

22:12.534 --> 22:16.767
so let's say that if I get an A,
can I get my own car?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.834
Any kind you want,
sweetheart.

22:42.167 --> 22:44.267
