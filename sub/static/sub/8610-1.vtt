03:38.885 --> 03:40.886
Oh, Mr. Beauregard.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.265
An answer for you from New Orleans.

03:44.641 --> 03:49.687
- What do they say?
- Sundowner sails the 21st. Stop.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.398
Destination: Europe. Stop.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.942
Reservation: confirmed.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.819
Stop.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.114
Request deposit $500. Stop.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.661
Hey! What about the $500?

04:05.912 --> 04:09.874
No hurry.
The important thing is there's a ship.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.196
Gee!

11:05.832 --> 11:07.332
$10!

11:08.501 --> 11:12.045
How'd he do it, Pa?
I only heard one shot.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.548
It's a question of speed, son.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.260
Ain't nobody faster on the draw
than him?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.305
Faster than him?

11:23.433 --> 11:24.391
Nobody.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.710
Red!

16:05.047 --> 16:06.923
Too late, amigo.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.628
Who did it?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.088
You did.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.176
When you first started looking for me.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.886
Where's Nevada?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.349
Holed up at Akema.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.810
He ain't about to move from there.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.568
What were you doing here?
Who shot you?

17:09.444 --> 17:11.279
- Go...
- Where?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.205
Go screw yourself.

17:21.624 --> 17:26.627
You alone are responsible to us
form a king the gold legal.

17:27.213 --> 17:31.967
Instead, Sullivan, you chase
After your own personal affairs.

17:32.218 --> 17:36.137
You're leaving a trail of dead bodies
Across the state.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.057
A trail that leads straight here.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.892
Jack Beauregard.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.602
Yeah!

17:43.396 --> 17:46.648
We pay you
'cause you're respectable.

17:48.818 --> 17:53.154
A gentleman with a worked-out mine
who discovered anew vein.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.908
Any suspicion that falls on you,
falls on the gold.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.910
What are you afraid of?

17:59.495 --> 18:03.081
You've got everyone
exactly where you want them.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.626
I could shout the truth
from the rooftops.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.422
I could bring the sheriff in here
and say, "Look. "

18:10.673 --> 18:13.925
If we didn't add
the stolen gold to the ore,

18:14.176 --> 18:17.053
this mine would only produce rock.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.848
I could even show them.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.517
And nobody would believe me.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.812
And they'd all be blind and deaf.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.231
But not dumb.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.609
There's talk going around.

18:30.860 --> 18:34.779
Talk gets into places
where there ain't no fear.

18:35.823 --> 18:41.578
The ore that comes out of this mine
has got to be refined legally.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.750
You keep your hands clean, Sullivan.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.839
If I don't kill

18:53.049 --> 18:54.674
Beauregard first,

18:54.884 --> 18:56.551
he'll kill me.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.679
That's right.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.730
Two things go to a man's heart.
Bullets and gold.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.941
You telling me

19:12.151 --> 19:14.319
to buy Jack Beauregard?

19:17.782 --> 19:19.240
Why not?

19:20.284 --> 19:22.118
We bought you.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.789
Buy him or kill him. But do it fast!

19:27.583 --> 19:29.626
You hear me? Fast!

19:45.059 --> 19:48.311
Hey!
Load up 20 of them horseshoes.

19:52.608 --> 19:56.486
- Is it going to take much longer?
- Nearly done.

19:57.530 --> 20:01.074
He's got nothing but junk here.
Look at this.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.535
Who's gonna buy this?

20:05.371 --> 20:06.830
And this.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.835
Even a broken shoe.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.607
Hey, you!

20:36.777 --> 20:39.529
Hey! Where'd he come from?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.537
What are you doing in there?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.165
- Sleeping.
- This ain't no hotel.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.253
- What are you looking for?
- A horse.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.519
Hey. Make him pay first.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.605
Why?

21:19.945 --> 21:23.156
You might not live long enough
to get credit.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.543
Where you going?

21:37.922 --> 21:42.175
The secret of along life
is to try not to shorten it.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.767
Hey!
Hold on there.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.895
- I can get you a horse.
- Honest?

21:54.313 --> 21:57.857
Sure. But first you got
to do me a little favor.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.276
Come here.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.158
Give me here.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.246
There's a pal of mine
over there in that saloon.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.498
You take him this basket.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.876
When you get back
I'll find you a horse.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.298
This pal of yours.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.801
It's Jack Beauregard, huh?

22:25.719 --> 22:27.720
A bargain's a bargain.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.435
- A horse, huh?
- Sure, son.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.938
The best.

23:12.641 --> 23:17.020
- I smell beans and bacon.
- For the three men out there.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.606
They won't be hungry much longer.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.288
Is the ship still there?

23:35.748 --> 23:38.583
Sailing date 16 days. Stop.

23:39.001 --> 23:42.545
Must have $500
to confirm reservation. Stop.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.059
What should I tell New Orleans?

23:56.268 --> 23:58.394
There are still 16 days.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.232
16 days ain't very long.
Even for you.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.736
If you go away, who will be left?

24:08.030 --> 24:11.783
- Nobody.
- But a man's got to quit some time.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.370
Some time.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.790
Someone like you
Has to go out with style.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.711
Come here just to tell me that?

24:25.464 --> 24:26.965
Oh, no.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.978
For me?

24:43.148 --> 24:45.483
What do you think's in it?

24:46.652 --> 24:48.611
I reckon it's a bomb.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.828
I reckon you're right.
Who sent it?

24:58.831 --> 25:01.582
Three fellas out there. Only three.

25:02.001 --> 25:05.336
- Only?
- Yeah. Like that time in El Paso.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.926
5th of March 1882.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.931
Billy Mason, John Murray,
Fred Carson.

25:19.935 --> 25:23.855
- '82 was one of your best...
- What did you bring this for?

25:24.106 --> 25:25.565
A horse.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.775
Like I was saying...

25:28.027 --> 25:31.070
In April '82 in Albuquerque, four.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.448
Jackson, Johnson...

25:33.699 --> 25:35.825
Murdoch and Champion.

25:37.703 --> 25:42.081
- How many horses to take it back?
- None. My pleasure.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.087
It was in the fall
that you really scored.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.465
September, Socorro.

25:51.133 --> 25:56.095
Five! Milton, Woolman,
Firestone, McDonald and Valence.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.932
How come you know so much about me?

26:00.642 --> 26:05.730
Everyone knows about Jack Beauregard.
The West's hope for law and order.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.942
Start admiring someone,
pretty soon you're envious.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.904
So you start showing off.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.865
You take chances
and before you know it

26:17.076 --> 26:18.743
you're dead.

26:19.328 --> 26:23.081
It ain't good for some folks
to live too long.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.922
How many did you get at Heeler Bend?

26:31.173 --> 26:33.466
Six. No, seven!

26:33.926 --> 26:36.969
One tried to gun you
Behind your back.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.100
He says he don't want it.

26:44.186 --> 26:47.021
But you never got 150 all at once.

26:50.359 --> 26:55.113
You know, since I was a boy
I always dreamed of you like that.

26:55.364 --> 26:58.199
An immense, open plain.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.954
150 pure-bred sons of bitches
on horseback.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.998
And you facing them. Alone.

27:08.377 --> 27:11.462
- Why only 150?
- The Wild Bunch.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.757
- They are only 150. That's why.
- Yeah.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.553
150 who shoot and ride
like there's thousands.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.972
Who are you, anyway?

27:21.890 --> 27:23.558
Who, me?

27:24.560 --> 27:26.894
- Nobody.
- Get to be somebody.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.063
Then we'll surround them.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.940
Yeah!

27:31.150 --> 27:35.945
No. You got to face them alone.
You on one side. Them on the other.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.285
You don't need to wash it this time.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.090
D'you want a hand?
Hey, Jack!

27:58.427 --> 28:00.970
Jack, I found a horse. Wait!

28:07.769 --> 28:09.520
Turn around, you!

28:21.783 --> 28:25.161
- We got to shoot it out?
- You're his friend.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.289
I wish I was.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.917
You know what they say?

28:32.544 --> 28:37.006
He can draw his gun three times
before the other guy reaches.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.883
Like this.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.187
Well.
If we got to shoot it out, I'm ready.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.356
Well, just a...

28:53.565 --> 28:56.234
Hey, he did deliver the basket.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.527
- Yeah.
- Sure.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.405
- The son of a...
- Beauregard didn't want it.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.075
You earned yourself a horse.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.370
Thanks, amigo. I'll take this one.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.095
I'll be...!

29:36.608 --> 29:40.278
Blessed is he
who shares his neighbor's burden.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.402
Seen a white man around here?

31:09.701 --> 31:12.536
I'm looking for a white man.
Seen him?

31:13.872 --> 31:16.082
Where is he?

31:17.376 --> 31:20.544
I won't hurt him. He's my brother.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.862
What are you doing here?

31:50.158 --> 31:52.159
Praying.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.995
- Good thing you are.
- Why?

31:56.164 --> 32:00.292
'Cause you're always following me
and I don't like it.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.712
I got a lot of friends here.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.259
Chief Broken Branch died yesterday.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.345
Priest arrived in time,
medicine man didn't.

32:12.180 --> 32:17.143
- What brings you among the Injuns?
- I'm looking for someone.

32:26.528 --> 32:27.987
Sam Peckinpah.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.782
That's a beautiful name in Navajo.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.204
- Friend or enemy?
- That's my business.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.626
Listen to this one.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.629
Eno Poknomah.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.967
What's his name?

32:50.385 --> 32:52.428
That's his business.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.763
Nevada Kid.

33:01.271 --> 33:05.357
- You know where he is?
- Must be down below.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.769
The best are always the first to go.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.481
So you ain't going nowhere.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.654
You're staying here
with your Injun friends for good.

34:22.310 --> 34:26.397
What's the matter?
You got to have a crowd watching?

34:28.483 --> 34:30.525
You said you was nobody.

34:30.902 --> 34:35.447
Here's your chance to make a name
For yourself on one of them.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.829
Turn around!

34:43.456 --> 34:45.248
Draw!

35:03.101 --> 35:06.604
Let's bring my personal history
up to date.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.609
Today. June 3rd, 1899.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.028
Nobody.

35:26.625 --> 35:31.378
You're the kind that needs
an audience so you can show off.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.381
Four shots. One hole.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.800
Like the good old days.

35:42.015 --> 35:45.100
There was never any good old days.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.646
Tell me. What's your game?

35:51.983 --> 35:55.944
As a kid I used to make believe
I was Jack Beauregard.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.412
And now that you're all growed up?

36:06.081 --> 36:08.082
I'm more cautious.

36:08.333 --> 36:12.586
Sometimes running a little risk
can bring big rewards.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.841
If the risk is little,

36:18.510 --> 36:20.678
the reward is little.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.977
First Nevada,

36:29.604 --> 36:31.188
then Red.

36:31.898 --> 36:35.275
- They tried to get me twice.
- They'll try again.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.906
What the hell are they up to?

36:41.449 --> 36:43.450
Oh, you'll find out.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.714
I see it clear as crystal.

39:03.091 --> 39:07.719
Jack Beauregard standing alone.
Facing the Wild Bunch.

39:16.938 --> 39:21.316
Just think of it.
You'll be in all the history books.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.737
You'll be down on Earth reading them

39:26.364 --> 39:29.449
while I'm up there playing on a harp.

39:49.971 --> 39:53.515
You shine
like the door of a whorehouse.

39:53.892 --> 39:57.936
- A blind man could spot you miles off.
- I like folks to see me.

39:58.855 --> 40:02.065
Maybe folks don't share
your pleasure.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.824
Thanks.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.954
But I prefer my own.
The air sharpens the wits.

40:20.919 --> 40:25.464
It's a matter of time
before someone shoots holes in yours.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.561
Out of the way, shorty!

40:39.771 --> 40:43.190
Or I'll crush you underfoot
like a flea.

40:47.028 --> 40:49.446
You look so small from up here

40:49.864 --> 40:51.907
I can hardly see you.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.868
You got the message?

41:15.974 --> 41:19.559
- See any better now?
- I wish I'd never seen you.

42:00.685 --> 42:04.521
Here's a dollar.
Anybody else want to try?

42:04.772 --> 42:06.356
I'll have a try.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.241
Have another try.

42:16.451 --> 42:20.162
Like a woman. Give her the glad eye,
you get a black eye.

42:20.455 --> 42:23.832
Offer her a steak,
she makes mincemeat out of you.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.584
Come on up!

42:25.793 --> 42:28.336
Come on now, folks.
Step right up.

43:01.079 --> 43:04.372
Hit his head,
you'll win an apple pie.

43:04.624 --> 43:08.376
Score twelve, you can have
the nigger for the night.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.587
Give them all you've got.

43:11.005 --> 43:14.382
Three hits, only 50 cents.
Apple pie, $1.

43:14.592 --> 43:18.929
And for the reduced price of $2,
six cantaloupes.

43:19.180 --> 43:24.101
Six ripe cantaloupes.
When I say ripe, I mean ripe.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.478
Let me try.

43:28.064 --> 43:30.440
Come on! Move your arm there!

43:31.692 --> 43:35.487
Come on, folks.
Give them all you've got.

43:35.905 --> 43:38.532
Come on! Move your arm there!

43:38.783 --> 43:40.867
What's your name? Come on.

43:41.119 --> 43:44.621
Give them all you've got.
The fun of the game...

44:00.763 --> 44:03.849
What did you say
the fun of the game is?

44:06.978 --> 44:08.436
Son of a bitch.

44:19.991 --> 44:24.870
I can stay as long as I like.
I've as much right as any to be here.

44:28.249 --> 44:33.003
- Sleep there, grandpa.
- You stinking, mangy polecats.

44:33.421 --> 44:37.132
One day the worm will turn
and nip you in the bud.

44:37.383 --> 44:39.885
Tell your stinking boss Sullivan.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.515
Who the hell are you?

44:52.190 --> 44:54.316
I'll take 3:1 on Squirrel.

44:54.483 --> 44:56.818
Another $10 on Squirrel.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.636
Come on, folks.

45:23.471 --> 45:25.347
3:1 on Squirrel.

45:37.818 --> 45:41.821
He's a great shot but he could miss.
Try your luck.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.051
Hi.

46:05.513 --> 46:07.013
Beer.

46:18.859 --> 46:22.028
- How'd you like to play with this?
- Like that?

46:27.535 --> 46:30.203
Hey, what's the game? Can I play?

46:30.371 --> 46:32.706
Sure. Anyone can play.

46:37.712 --> 46:39.754
If you can afford it.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.132
If you can shoot.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.676
And if you can drink.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.906
Okay. I'll have a go.

47:08.242 --> 47:10.201
Ten... twenty.

47:10.411 --> 47:14.539
Know the rules? Hit the glass
before it hits the floor.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.792
Come on, folks. Who'll take me on?

47:18.169 --> 47:20.962
Place your bets. 2:1 on the stranger.

47:21.172 --> 47:25.300
3:1. This is real special.
Any takers? Come on, folks.

47:29.597 --> 47:31.598
Hey, Marshall. Here.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.690
Can't I do it with milk?

47:42.026 --> 47:44.944
I'll take five. Come on, folks. 5:1.

47:45.196 --> 47:47.072
Who'll take me on?

47:48.115 --> 47:50.200
Here's six for me, Marshall.

48:14.308 --> 48:16.726
Lucky skunk!

49:17.204 --> 49:19.164
That one got away.

49:34.472 --> 49:35.972
Lucky bastard!

49:50.070 --> 49:52.113
Come on. Now it's 7:1.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.431
Lucky shit!

51:29.169 --> 51:30.670
Hold it!

51:33.424 --> 51:35.216
The game's over.

51:45.853 --> 51:48.271
- Lucky...
- ... he didn't aim at you.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.612
There you are. 200.

52:06.707 --> 52:10.209
Whisky.
These games make a man thirsty.

52:22.139 --> 52:25.308
That evens the score for glasses.

52:49.375 --> 52:51.501
Now let's try pistols.

53:00.678 --> 53:03.513
Your upside-down pistols worry me.

53:03.931 --> 53:07.517
Fell as that carry them like that
are bad medicine.

53:23.784 --> 53:25.284
Clown.

53:26.120 --> 53:29.080
- Now, we can't miss.
- Smart a leck.

53:53.480 --> 53:57.817
You fell as don't seem to catch on.
It's actually simple.

53:58.026 --> 53:59.527
Pay attention.

54:12.416 --> 54:13.374
How d'you do?

54:20.799 --> 54:23.968
We play for higher stakes up here.

54:25.721 --> 54:27.764
Scape's talking to you.

54:34.313 --> 54:36.856
Why don't you join us?

54:43.822 --> 54:47.074
It ain't nice
to shoot a man in the back.

55:24.363 --> 55:27.740
- This a game two can play?
- If you know the rules.

55:33.664 --> 55:36.457
For me every game has the same rule.

55:39.044 --> 55:42.880
- Play to win.
- The whole town has to see this game.

55:44.424 --> 55:46.801
Big audience, big take.

55:51.682 --> 55:53.724
Two thousand.

55:55.811 --> 56:00.106
- Who's gonna lose this hand?
He'll be here tomorrow.

56:00.315 --> 56:02.942
The name's Jack Beauregard.

56:08.782 --> 56:11.492
That's a name to reckon with.

56:15.622 --> 56:17.832
How much do you reckon?

56:25.966 --> 56:28.009
Five hundred?

56:31.346 --> 56:33.639
A thousand more, perhaps?

56:34.349 --> 56:38.102
I reckon I may never spend it.
Why Jack Beauregard?

56:41.607 --> 56:43.983
Will this do for an answer?

56:52.117 --> 56:56.495
You paid for a front row seat.
Don't miss the show.

56:57.039 --> 56:58.539
I won't.

58:54.865 --> 58:58.284
Only three shots.
You still got one to go.

59:04.541 --> 59:08.210
The next one might hit
a couple of inches lower.

59:19.639 --> 59:22.975
Your life's hanging by a thread,
Mr. Beauregard.

59:24.352 --> 59:29.231
Looks like you got your audience
so we can wind up this little story.

59:29.441 --> 59:31.400
It's an old story for you.

59:31.651 --> 59:33.861
January'86. Madison.

59:34.071 --> 59:39.116
- The same situation, remember?
- I faced three bastards that day.

59:39.534 --> 59:41.035
Exactly.

59:54.007 --> 59:57.760
Seems that hole was aching
For another bullet.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:15.861
When the spirit is willing
the flesh has the strength of ten.

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:30.996
- Can I send a telegram?
- Yes, sir. It costs 25 cents a word.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:37.419
Maritime Company, New Orleans.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:41.966
Request confirmation of reservation.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.969
Sundowner, sailing 12 days. Stop.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:49.056
$500 deposit follows. Stop.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:52.851
Signed Jack Beauregard.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.257
Look who's back.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:09.178
What are you holding that for?

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:14.975
Idiots.

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.980
You go catch those two.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:25.444
He's gone into the corner room.

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:29.281
Come on. Quiet.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.881
Up there. I guess he's asleep.

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:49.510
I heard him set his alarm clock.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:53.180
This will wake him quicker
than any alarm.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:58.435
He must be right up there.

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:01.605
I'll go.

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:28.715
- Get him?
- No.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.844
- He must be on the other side.
- I'm here.

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:45.315
- Breaking mirrors is bad luck.
- Give me a match.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.154
Light it.

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:06.587
- Well, it only lasts one minute.
- Light it.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.768
Don't you think I ought to get down?

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:26.648
People waste days and weeks and years

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:31.820
till all of a sudden
there's only 30 seconds to go.

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.412
It stopped.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.295
Happens to everyone.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.137
Don John, where are you?

01:06:58.097 --> 01:06:59.765
I'm here.

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:01.642
Me too.

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:09.650
Wham! Bam!

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:13.862
Thank you, ma'am.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:02.244
- That's real funny.
- Nothing funny about death.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:09.710
Shut up!

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.549
There are eight of them.
Look!

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.885
What a lot of Nobodys,
Reflections one and all.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:22.096
In truth there's only one.
Which is that son of a gun?

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:24.099
The third one.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:27.603
You really are slipping. Hold this.

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:29.438
Who? Me?

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.773
Yes. You.

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:45.621
- Well?
- Well.

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:50.292
Nevada.
And that other sneak thief Red.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:53.337
They bought me out.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.340
For$200!

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.468
Fine partners I had.

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:03.346
My share of the mine
For 200 measly, stinking dollars.

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.640
And now my bag's empty.

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:11.313
I got so mad it gave me asthma.

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:14.774
See how I live?
Have to breathe this shit.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:19.071
I don't want to talk about it.
Ain't no use persisting.

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:25.035
If you want to persist,
you'll have to persist harder.

01:09:43.054 --> 01:09:45.346
The man himself told me.

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:47.349
"Joe, old pal," he said.

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:51.478
"That ain't no mine.
It's just a hole in the ground.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:56.233
Nobody ain't never gonna find
no gold in there.

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:59.778
Now, that city slicker,
that Sullivan,

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:02.614
he wants to buy it for $600.

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:04.908
And that ain't hay, Joe.

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:09.329
Why, you could live
on your share of it for a year. "

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.958
That's what they told me.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.772
- Then what?
- The ore ran out.

01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:39.151
The money ran out
And the liquor ran out.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:52.622
This'll quench your thirst.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:56.251
Come to the point.
I got no more dough either.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:00.797
Tarnation!

01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:03.967
That mine began pouring out gold.

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:08.638
I say I deserve a share.
At least enough to keep me in liquor.

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:11.725
But what did Red and Nevada do?

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:15.687
They ran off somewhere.
The dirty coyotes.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:21.026
Red and Nevada are dead.
You can drink to their memory.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:29.576
Like I say, he who lives by the sword
will get nipped in the bud.

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:06.214
No, no! I surrender!

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:49.132
Next time, knock
before you come busting in.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.688
You playing games?

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:08.318
A lot of guys try to kill me
so they can brag about it.

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:11.363
You had your audience and target.

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:14.532
Opportunity don't knock twice.

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:17.994
Well, that depends
on your point of view.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.083
It's a dangerous game.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.793
Yeah.

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:31.758
It ain't easy to make balls spin.

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:40.058
Even if you do,

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:42.143
they wind up in the hole.

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:45.230
It's gone in! It's gone in! It's...

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:50.360
- Missed by a hair.
- Fact is, you saved my life today.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:55.240
I'd rather it was my fault I got shot
than yours I didn't.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.867
That's horse manure, son.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:01.830
It's better not to get shot
For nobody's fault.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:10.839
Why did you blow on these balls?
It don't count.

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:15.176
- I wanted to let out some air.
- While you do, tell me.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:19.806
- Why were you sitting in the street?
- I got tired of standing.

01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:27.564
You keep turning your back to me.
Seems like you trust me too much.

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:31.026
Maybe you trust yourself too much.

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:35.905
Hear the story about the birdie?
My grandpa told me.

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:39.826
When I was a boy
men didn't live to become grandpas.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:42.996
It weren't easy, but it could be done.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:52.714
There was this birdie
who couldn't fly yet.

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:54.966
One freezing cold night

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:59.304
he tumbles out of his nest
and lands on the ground.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:04.059
Well, he starts going,
"Peep! Peep! Peep!"

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:05.685
Like crazy

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:08.354
'cause he's nearly freezing.

01:16:08.856 --> 01:16:12.233
Lucky for him,
Along comes this cow.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:15.528
She sees him and feels sorry for him.

01:16:16.363 --> 01:16:17.864
So,

01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:20.825
she lifts her tail.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.079
And: splat!

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:28.041
Drops a steaming hot cow pie
right on him.

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:33.088
The birdie is warm but he ain't happy
and keeps going "Peep!

01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:36.591
Peep! Peep! Peep!", louder than ever.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:47.519
Mean old coyote hears someone,
comes a-running.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:51.731
He reaches out a paw,

01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:54.943
pulls him out of the cow pie.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.948
He brushes the dirt off, real nice.

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:01.950
And then...

01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:13.461
swallows him in one gulp.

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:19.050
Grandpa said there was amoral
but I had to figure it out myself.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.136
Bird?

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:23.805
Coyote? Cow pie?

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:27.934
It don't make no sense to me no how.

01:17:28.519 --> 01:17:31.521
You still believe in fairy tales.

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:34.607
Yep.

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:37.068
For example.

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:43.074
This is the good guy
who's got to avenge his brother.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.578
This is the bad guy

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:52.417
who's gonna get killed
because he shot the brother.

01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:57.463
- And this...
- Is my blue-eyed guardian angel.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.676
That's Nobody.

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:08.349
That leaves you and me face to face.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.020
Nope.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:19.485
That leaves you alone.

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:21.779
Against 150.

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:36.961
You're sure trying hard
to make a hero of me.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:42.342
You're that already. You just need
Something to make your name a legend.

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:48.806
What I don't understand
is what difference it makes to you.

01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:55.939
If a man is a man,
he needs someone to believe in.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.951
I've met all kinds in my life.

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:13.414
Thieves and killers.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.542
Pimps and prostitutes.

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:19.170
Con men and preachers.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.548
Even a few fellas
that told the truth.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:26.010
The kind you're talking about, never.

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:29.973
Maybe you've never met them.
Or hardly ever.

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:33.017
But they're the only ones who count.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.988
Reckon this fella's name is Sullivan.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.783
Reckon it is.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:53.579
Hey!

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:56.374
He's taken Sullivan away!

01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:01.963
But Sullivan's nothing.
It's the Wild Bunch behind him.

01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:04.716
We got to warn that young fella.

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:07.468
But if he kills Sullivan,

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.806
he'll have 150 bloodthirsty cutthroats
on his tail.

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:16.978
- He'll make trouble for his self.
- He'll make a name for himself.

01:20:20.774 --> 01:20:25.194
The way he's galloping,
he must be in a hurry to make it.

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:34.662
If you kill me, the Wild Bunch
will know you're onto them.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:46.632
They said, "Kill him or buy him. "

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:49.927
I wouldn't try
unless it was my last chance.

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:52.221
You know how Nevada was.

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:56.100
Him, Red and me had an agreement
For an extra share.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:21:00.813
You know even better than me
how he hated sharing anything.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.733
He deserved the bullet he got.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.569
Red did it.

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:09.781
But I kept his share.

01:21:10.991 --> 01:21:16.287
It's yours now. Take all you want.
Live like a king for 100 years.

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:21.542
I don't intend to get that old.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:50.029
I only need 500.

01:21:57.371 --> 01:22:00.415
Is there a telegraph office in town?

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:04.669
- How do I get to New Orleans?
- Go to Kimball.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:07.171
There's a train from there Fridays.

01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:42.540
Disappointed?

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:46.544
Yep.

01:22:47.421 --> 01:22:50.381
I counted on your brotherly feeling.

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:55.720
Beats me how kids like you think
'cause a man's older than you

01:22:55.929 --> 01:23:01.142
he has old-fashioned notions
like blood's thicker than water.

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:04.770
Sure, Nevada's my brother.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:08.691
But he's a grade-A skunk
who shot people in the back.

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:11.652
What's more, he stole $10,000 off me.

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:14.780
I ain't risking my life
to avenge him.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:18.326
How modern
the old folks are becoming.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:23.122
But a hero can't run away
from his destiny.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:29.420
My destiny is to get the hell out.
On a ship that's sailing for Europe.

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:35.092
Sometimes you run into your destiny
On the road you take to avoid it.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:39.096
If you mean the Wild Bunch,
forget it.

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.516
I ain't taking them on.

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:49.690
You will, Jack. You will.

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:45.741
Put it over there.

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:54.949
- Hold it!
- Where's it going?

01:30:55.158 --> 01:30:57.910
Use your eyes, man. It's shunting.

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:00.996
But...
Who's driving it?

01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:02.873
Who?

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:05.459
They've stolen the train!

01:33:07.665 --> 01:33:09.958
There's only150 of them.

01:33:10.168 --> 01:33:13.587
But they ride
like they were thousands.

01:35:04.782 --> 01:35:07.242
A man's got to quit some time.

01:35:09.495 --> 01:35:13.248
Someone like you has
to go out with style.

01:36:58.563 --> 01:37:00.522
Just think of it.

01:37:00.773 --> 01:37:05.485
150 pure-bred sons of bitches
on horseback.

01:37:06.112 --> 01:37:08.155
And you facing them.

01:37:08.406 --> 01:37:09.906
Alone.

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:15.620
You'll be in all the history books.

01:37:20.335 --> 01:37:23.754
You'll be down on Earth reading them

01:37:25.465 --> 01:37:28.342
while I'm under it, in my grave.

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:30.130
- Like the door of a whorehouse.
- I like folks to see me.

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:58.426
You'll end in history.

01:41:05.685 --> 01:41:07.519
You'll end in history.

01:41:13.025 --> 01:41:14.734
You'll end in history.

01:41:20.366 --> 01:41:22.033
You'll end in history.

01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:29.499
You've ended in history!

01:44:51.368 --> 01:44:52.869
Well.

01:44:54.038 --> 01:44:56.998
Now you got me in the history books.

01:44:57.666 --> 01:45:00.919
- How do I quit?
- There's only one way.

01:45:02.505 --> 01:45:04.547
How's that?

01:45:06.425 --> 01:45:08.510
You got to die.

01:45:23.609 --> 01:45:27.821
- Where?
- Where there's lots of people.

01:45:29.532 --> 01:45:32.492
They're gonna shoot each other!

01:48:09.483 --> 01:48:13.152
I told you
Your life was hanging by a thread.

01:48:38.012 --> 01:48:39.721
Dear Nobody,

01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:42.974
Dying isn't the worse thing
to happen.

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:48.312
I've been dead for three days now
and I've finally found my peace.

01:48:48.939 --> 01:48:52.608
You used to say my life
was hanging by a thread.

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:57.739
Maybe so, but it's your life
that's hanging by a thread now.

01:48:58.282 --> 01:49:00.283
Well, that's one.

01:49:02.327 --> 01:49:04.370
Let's get the other!

01:49:05.706 --> 01:49:09.792
Quite a few people
would like to cut that thread.

01:49:10.085 --> 01:49:13.838
Yeah, I guess it's your way
Of feeling alive.

01:49:14.590 --> 01:49:17.967
There's a difference
between you and me.

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:21.054
I tried to steer away from trouble.

01:49:21.263 --> 01:49:24.140
You seem to look for it all the time.

01:49:24.641 --> 01:49:28.770
But I must admit, you've been able
to solve your share.

01:49:28.979 --> 01:49:34.108
You like others to take the credit
so that you can remain a nobody.

01:49:34.526 --> 01:49:37.195
You got it all nicely figured out.

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:42.825
But now there's too many people
who know you're somebody after all.

01:49:43.035 --> 01:49:47.205
You won't have much time left
For playing your games.

01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:49.540
They'll make your life hard

01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:54.545
Until you too meet somebody
who wants to put you down in history.

01:49:54.755 --> 01:49:59.884
You'll find out that the only way
to become a nobody again is to die.

01:50:04.098 --> 01:50:07.141
From now on
you'll be walking in my boots.

01:50:07.351 --> 01:50:10.478
Maybe you won't laugh so loud anymore.

01:50:10.687 --> 01:50:13.147
But you can still do one thing.

01:50:13.357 --> 01:50:18.069
You can preserve the illusion
that made my generation tick.

01:50:18.278 --> 01:50:23.157
You'll do it in your own funny way
but we'll still be grateful.

01:50:24.535 --> 01:50:26.911
'Cause looking back

01:50:27.329 --> 01:50:30.832
it seems to me
we were a bunch of romantic fools.

01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:36.212
We believed a good pistol
and a showdown could solve everything.

01:50:37.172 --> 01:50:41.092
The West used to be open spaces
with elbowroom.

01:50:41.343 --> 01:50:44.720
You never ran
into the same person twice.

01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:47.682
By the time you came
it was changed.

01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:52.311
So small and crowded
you bumped into people all the time.

01:51:42.613 --> 01:51:47.491
You're able to run around the West,
peacefully catching flies

01:51:47.701 --> 01:51:50.995
because fellas like me
were there first.

01:51:51.246 --> 01:51:55.166
The same fellas you want
to see in history books.

01:51:55.417 --> 01:51:59.503
People need something to believe in,
like you say.

01:52:00.214 --> 01:52:03.633
You can't have it your own way
much longer.

01:52:03.884 --> 01:52:06.260
The country ain't the same.

01:52:06.511 --> 01:52:10.181
And I'm already
feeling a stranger myself.

01:52:10.682 --> 01:52:12.808
But, what's worse,

01:52:13.018 --> 01:52:15.478
violence has changed too.

01:52:15.729 --> 01:52:18.814
It's grown and got organized.

01:52:19.024 --> 01:52:22.944
A good pistol
don't mean a damn thing anymore.

01:52:23.612 --> 01:52:26.364
But I guess you must know all this.

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:30.159
'Cause it's your kind of times,
not mine.

01:52:30.786 --> 01:52:34.538
I figured out the moral
to your grandpa's story.

01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:38.876
The cow covered the bird
with cow pie to keep it warm

01:52:39.086 --> 01:52:42.088
and the coyote hauled it out
and ate it.

01:52:42.339 --> 01:52:45.549
It's the moral
of these new times of yours.

01:52:45.759 --> 01:52:49.929
Folks who throw dirt on you
don't always want to hurt you.

01:52:50.138 --> 01:52:54.517
Folks that pull you out of a jam
don't always want to help you.

01:52:54.726 --> 01:52:56.560
The main point is

01:52:56.770 --> 01:53:01.148
when you're up to your nose in shit,
keep your mouth shut.

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:16.080
This is why people like me got to go.

01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:21.252
And why you faked that gunfight
to get me out of the West clean.

01:53:22.129 --> 01:53:25.172
I was getting to be
one more oldtimer.

01:53:25.382 --> 01:53:28.634
The years don't make wisdom,
just old age.

01:53:28.885 --> 01:53:32.805
One can be young in years
and old in hours, like you.

01:53:33.015 --> 01:53:36.600
I'm talking like a preacher,
but it's your fault.

01:53:36.852 --> 01:53:40.187
What can you expect
of a national monument?

01:53:40.397 --> 01:53:42.773
Keep your mind and heart open.

01:53:42.983 --> 01:53:46.569
If you meet one of those men
you almost never meet

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:50.906
you can keep each other company
and you won't be lonely.

01:53:51.116 --> 01:53:54.702
They say
distance makes friendship stronger.

01:53:54.953 --> 01:53:59.165
Maybe so, after three days
without you dogging my tracks

01:53:59.374 --> 01:54:01.417
I kind of miss you.

01:54:06.256 --> 01:54:09.091
I really got to sign off now

01:54:09.301 --> 01:54:12.887
so, even if you've been
a nosy troublemaker,

01:54:13.138 --> 01:54:15.014
thanks for everything.

01:54:15.223 --> 01:54:18.809
P.S. One more piece of advice
from an oldtimer.

01:54:19.019 --> 01:54:23.773
If you get a shave, make sure
the right man's wearing the jacket.
