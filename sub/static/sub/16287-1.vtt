Good morning, Mr. Parker.

02:23.199 --> 02:24.666
Sorry to bother you in the morning ...

02:24.666 --> 02:27.335
But Mr. Goldstein requested that

02:54.585 --> 02:57.075
Brian, I'm glad I came early.

02:58.754 --> 03:02.553
The company has been going through
difficult in recent months.

03:03.423 --> 03:07.226
We have to make some cuts.
I'm sorry, Brian.

03:07.226 --> 03:11.160

Beware of Mr. Toad.

- And his father?

05:44.322 --> 05:49.525

06:01.966 --> 06:06.435

DIRECTOR OF SALES

06:15.608 --> 06:17.666
You can talk, honey.

06:19.744 --> 06:21.574
About the trip ...

06:22.612 --> 06:24.238
You will not.

06:24.847 --> 06:29.282
- It's not what I'm saying.
- How long is this plan?

06:29.349 --> 06:31.214
I know. For months.

06:32.318 --> 06:36.879
Sorry. I would also like
with you ...

06:37.054 --> 06:41.717
- But I have no choice, baby.
- You almost did not get Zack.

06:41.958 --> 06:44.426
He says he can not wait
You teach him to swim.

06:44.426 --> 06:45.858
What I would say to him?

06:50.729 --> 06:52.424
I do not know.

06:54.165 --> 06:55.995
- I do not know.
- True.

06:56.099 --> 06:59.802
Today's meeting is only for
Goldstein took our case.

06:59.802 --> 07:02.003
We lost two big clients
this month. He was very angry.

07:02.003 --> 07:05.272
Want to work two-fold.
I had no choice, baby.

07:05.272 --> 07:08.440
And his family, Brian?
You think of us?

07:08.440 --> 07:12.176
Leanne, this is not fair.
I did the best I can.

07:12.176 --> 07:15.167
But regardless
what is most important.

07:16.712 --> 07:20.615
Do not forget to make
a contribution of $ 25,000 ...

07:20.615 --> 07:23.310
to prom
Cancer Society.

07:25.284 --> 07:26.580
I know.

07:28.486 --> 07:31.282
Must go, honey.

07:33.389 --> 07:36.356
I'm very sorry.
I love you.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.118
I asked Zack to contact you
when we arrived.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.953
Right.

07:50.766 --> 07:52.528

09:08.914 --> 09:10.608
We went.

09:10.982 --> 09:12.243
Okay.

09:21.522 --> 09:22.886
It will be fine.

10:06.382 --> 10:07.906
Jesse?

10:09.017 --> 10:11.382
I do not believe that has not been arrested.

10:11.752 --> 10:13.310
Neither do I.

10:14.888 --> 10:16.286
Relax.

10:27.162 --> 10:31.864
My name is Mr. Parker. I called
because the job ...

10:31.864 --> 10:33.729
that appears in today's paper.

10:34.466 --> 10:35.933
It is, yes.

10:39.136 --> 10:42.626
Right. This is an annual?
Okay.

10:44.705 --> 10:46.229
Jesus.

10:48.241 --> 10:53.643
Hi, Julie. This is Brian.
Yes He?

10:54.812 --> 10:59.544
I know. Travel news.
Is he there?

11:03.217 --> 11:07.652
Tuesday? I'll call again in a week
who came. Tranquil. Great.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.784
Mr. Dunn, please.

11:36.437 --> 11:40.740
That's why I'm calling.
You are free now?

11:40.740 --> 11:44.139
We can arrange for lunch
or dinner in a few days.

11:47.511 --> 11:49.034
In one hour?

12:18.129 --> 12:21.599
You have a great reputation.
And very talented.

12:21.599 --> 12:24.467
I'm sure soon things
will improve for you.

12:24.467 --> 12:27.434
I have to get money for
My wife continued to make a donation.

12:27.735 --> 12:30.837
- Thank you.
- All right, man. I must go.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.099
Okay.

12:33.339 --> 12:35.373
- Good to see you again.
- Thank you for finding me.

12:35.373 --> 12:37.242
- Good luck with the new company.
- Thank you. Please be careful.

12:37.242 --> 12:38.299
Goodbye.

12:49.048 --> 12:51.917
This is rubbish.
I can not sell it.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.985
This is to stop it, man.

12:53.985 --> 12:57.521
This is to stop being
panic pansy.

12:57.521 --> 13:00.011
You call me that as a child.

13:04.391 --> 13:07.052
- Dan Brook?
- How is it?

13:07.760 --> 13:11.592
Did you know that she broke up with her boyfriend
and the market is back?

13:12.696 --> 13:16.687
We went. You Jesse McAllister.
Just put the pieces together.

13:18.433 --> 13:22.993
- Brooke sucks proud.
- Shallow and rude as well.

13:24.870 --> 13:28.236
- But this is beautiful.
- And you?

13:29.239 --> 13:32.208
When you go up the nerve
to call someone out?

13:32.208 --> 13:36.311
- The time will come.
- Would you wait if something does not change much.

13:36.311 --> 13:40.370
Take action.
You look like a chess player ...

13:41.114 --> 13:42.876
only thinner.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.643
Did you know that Bill Gates
Chess team, right?

13:47.251 --> 13:48.649
Whatever.

13:50.386 --> 13:52.520
This is to stop it, man.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.920
It's easy to say, Richie Rich Rico.
Why do you care?

13:59.759 --> 14:01.020
Here.

14:01.993 --> 14:03.516
Take it.

14:03.994 --> 14:08.122
They are $ 200. This is the maximum
who will get this nonsense.

14:10.464 --> 14:13.432
Please, Jesse.
Please accept.

14:15.101 --> 14:18.092
My parents have a lot of money,
I do not care.

14:25.675 --> 14:28.268
- Thank you.
- Okay.

14:33.112 --> 14:35.978
How are you, Ken? Thank you for
answered my call.

14:36.181 --> 14:37.579
Tranquil.

14:38.783 --> 14:41.483
The truth is I
problem, Ken.

14:41.483 --> 14:45.486
I have to jump in on
portfolio to pay the bills.

14:45.486 --> 14:48.288
Yes, yes. In this economy,
Apparently this rule.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.654
- It is.
- How much are we talking about, Brian?

14:52.724 --> 14:55.526
During the experiment, can
pay me $ 10,000 a month ...

14:55.526 --> 14:57.288
for three months.

14:57.694 --> 15:02.096
I have donated $ 25,000 to
Cancer Society at the end of the month.

15:02.096 --> 15:06.429
- You know Leanne.
- I know. So 50 000?

15:06.733 --> 15:12.136
I do not know. Maybe we can close
at 100 000, just in case.

15:12.136 --> 15:14.204
I'm looking at your portfolio ...

15:14.204 --> 15:16.706
and seemed to lose
most of the properties ...

15:16.706 --> 15:20.107
- When the Telecorp bombed.
- What? Who has been hurt so much?

15:20.107 --> 15:23.376
Yes I think to sell
the rest of nature ...

15:23.376 --> 15:27.045
below market value,
with $ 75,000 for you.

15:27.045 --> 15:30.014
- Drugs. Really?
- Can I save 10 000 tomorrow ...

15:30.014 --> 15:32.315
- But the rest ...
- Really? Four months?

15:32.315 --> 15:33.449
But I warn you, Brian.

15:33.449 --> 15:36.918
If you do, the bank will understand
which will go bankrupt ...

15:36.918 --> 15:40.720
- And can take all your assets.
- I know how this works, Ken.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.155
But thanks for the warning.
Go ahead with the deal.

15:44.289 --> 15:46.153
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

15:46.557 --> 15:49.855
Brian, try to relax
and come drink with me, man.

15:51.093 --> 15:52.685
Already there, Ken.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.171
McAllister?

16:20.745 --> 16:22.575
What are you, Gus?

16:23.113 --> 16:25.672
To pay the rent last month.

16:36.254 --> 16:38.721
The rest is for later this month.

16:40.823 --> 16:43.290
Tell your mom
I sent "" hi "."

16:55.699 --> 16:59.759
Wow! Hi, Jess. He came early.

17:00.202 --> 17:03.135
This is Chuck.
She was new in town.

17:15.377 --> 17:17.208
Teens ...

17:49.765 --> 17:51.460
Bring me another, please.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.299
It had a bad day too, right?

18:05.608 --> 18:08.043
- I know you.
- Really?

18:08.043 --> 18:10.510
Yes I have it here?

18:14.815 --> 18:16.372
Age

18:18.283 --> 18:20.978
- He lives at 5.
- Really?

18:21.385 --> 18:23.352
Where to study?

18:25.787 --> 18:29.457
For too long, man.
In Brown. Class of 1991.

18:29.457 --> 18:32.289
I think not.
Me too.

18:32.759 --> 18:34.419
- In the same year?
- Yes

18:37.261 --> 18:39.496
- Are you Jimmy, is not it?
- Yes

18:39.496 --> 18:41.030
- Jimmy Moretti?
- Yes

18:41.030 --> 18:44.165
- How you've changed!
- You Parker, right?

18:44.165 --> 18:45.633
Yes, I'm Brian.
This place is yours?

18:45.633 --> 18:47.725
- It's mine, yes.
- Law.

18:48.135 --> 18:49.863
What a small world, man.

18:52.771 --> 18:55.706
- How are you?
- Difficult day, a man.

18:55.706 --> 18:57.468
- Really?
- Yes

18:58.842 --> 19:00.365
What is it?

19:01.343 --> 19:03.333
Cash or a woman?

19:04.078 --> 19:09.513
I saw that did not drink.
So it is either:

19:09.714 --> 19:12.409
Cash or a woman.

19:18.653 --> 19:22.519
I got fired today.
Can you believe it?

19:23.923 --> 19:25.617
Me off.

19:27.259 --> 19:29.283
I'm sorry.

19:30.393 --> 19:32.361
He married?

19:34.930 --> 19:37.726
I saw the alliance. He was married.

19:41.167 --> 19:43.157
I'm married, yes.

19:45.270 --> 19:47.169
What did she think?

19:52.007 --> 19:54.270
I have not told him, Jimmy.

19:54.742 --> 19:57.437
- I have not told him.
- And a smart guy.

19:58.511 --> 20:00.445
It could be worse.

20:02.247 --> 20:05.613
It can be allergic to alcohol.

20:07.517 --> 20:09.108
Wow!

20:11.418 --> 20:13.942
- It is on my own.
- Health

20:23.460 --> 20:25.051
Is trying to steal
my wallet?

20:30.697 --> 20:33.062
He tried to steal
wallet, kid.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.390
No!

20:42.071 --> 20:43.503
Let me go!

20:43.672 --> 20:45.935
- No, no!
- Get off me!

20:46.941 --> 20:48.542
No! Stop! No!

20:48.542 --> 20:50.941
You're lucky I do not
call the police.

20:52.410 --> 20:53.968
Pathetic!

20:57.514 --> 20:58.639
Let me go!

21:26.331 --> 21:29.959
- The bills are paid, is not it?
- Is when I get paid!

21:34.469 --> 21:36.800
Jesse? Jesse!

21:41.107 --> 21:43.597
I must see my father's face ...

21:44.042 --> 21:48.842
when I showed him
my home in Lakeview.

21:49.478 --> 21:52.581
You have a home
in Lakeview? Class A,

21:52.581 --> 21:57.107
You are right. Not cheap, but I need
maintain timely payments.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.078
I think, Jimmy,
that in some ...

22:03.654 --> 22:05.553
three months ...

22:05.922 --> 22:09.220
all this will blow
in my face.

22:12.292 --> 22:14.522
I come from a broken home.

22:16.395 --> 22:19.522
That's not cool, man.
Not at all.

22:22.366 --> 22:25.231
It is difficult for everyone.
For my mother, for all of us.

22:25.367 --> 22:29.803
I can not make them go through it.
I can not tell them what happened.

22:31.805 --> 22:33.362
This is complicated.

22:35.274 --> 22:37.298
You see that side of town?

22:37.876 --> 22:40.775
There are some ugly houses
Nobody likes to see ...

22:41.277 --> 22:44.803
drug dealers,
old cyclist. Nothing more.

22:45.747 --> 22:50.516
But now, every day of children
methamphetamine addiction ...

22:50.516 --> 22:54.644
a bankrupt man, a girl
sell her body to buy drugs.

22:55.653 --> 22:59.321
It's like a man, cancer.
Growing and growing ...

22:59.321 --> 23:01.118
to take care of everything.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.893
The city is dying, man.
Do not want to be around ...

23:06.893 --> 23:08.588
to see his last breath.

23:09.961 --> 23:13.657
I do not know. I like it here.

23:14.497 --> 23:17.065
And why would not you?
His parents were wealthy.

23:17.065 --> 23:19.067
They will do anything to that between
into a good college ...

23:19.067 --> 23:22.235
- And get a good job.
- You go to college.

23:22.235 --> 23:26.338
- You really believe that?
- There are programs ...

23:26.338 --> 23:29.274
- For the poor, right?
- Not only for the poor.

23:29.274 --> 23:31.036
I had other plans.

23:36.878 --> 23:39.277
- He was on his way.
- Who?

23:39.613 --> 23:41.512
Tara Ingleford.

23:41.648 --> 23:45.650
What? Tara Ingleford
is the way to what?

23:45.650 --> 23:49.483
- You like that since grade two.
- I know it!

23:50.020 --> 23:53.087
- What will I tell him?
- Be nice.

23:53.087 --> 23:55.223
- I'm not cool.
- Calm down.

23:55.223 --> 23:56.689
Damn!

23:58.124 --> 23:59.358
- How am I?
- Okay.

23:59.358 --> 24:01.893
- Really? And breath?
- Not so good.

24:01.893 --> 24:03.951
God!
He was behind me?

24:08.064 --> 24:09.655
Hi, boys!

24:11.699 --> 24:12.666
Hi

24:12.800 --> 24:15.461
I will do the following:
I will help you.

24:18.237 --> 24:21.000
It has $ 500 in there?

24:23.040 --> 24:24.768
I said I went bankrupt.
What do you want money?

24:24.941 --> 24:28.432
Where's your wallet?
How much?

24:36.847 --> 24:39.815
I have 10, 40 ...

24:44.385 --> 24:48.115
- Three hundred dollars.
- You'll owe me.

24:48.355 --> 24:50.957
I draw $ 200
at the ATM.

24:50.957 --> 24:54.084
Yes Continue to look.

24:56.560 --> 24:59.585
Hi, Mickey. This is Jimmy.

25:01.863 --> 25:04.729
Jimmy Moretti. That's it. Listen.

25:05.098 --> 25:06.733
I bet $ 500
in Indiana.

25:06.733 --> 25:08.666
Win by eight points
the difference.

25:09.234 --> 25:12.464
Yes Five hundred by eight points
in Indiana.

25:14.438 --> 25:16.632
Got it? Beauty.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.932
- Can I ask you, Jimmy?
- Can.

25:22.343 --> 25:25.572
- You have to bet $ 500 I?
- No

25:26.845 --> 25:30.973
- But it feels.
- Play 500 in 5000, my friend.

25:32.082 --> 25:35.284
- How so?
- Need to know something about me, Brian.

25:35.284 --> 25:40.854
- I'm not behind in anything I do.
- I've heard it before. And ridiculous.

25:40.854 --> 25:45.724
It is not nonsense. Go home
Indiana and watch the game tomorrow.

25:45.724 --> 25:50.250
If it does not win Indiana 90-82,
I give you $ 500 in my pocket.

25:51.060 --> 25:52.924
- From Your Pocket?
- Yes

25:53.395 --> 25:56.624
I like the deal. I am inside.

25:57.697 --> 25:59.095
Health

27:05.039 --> 27:06.305
CANCER SOCIETY

27:06.305 --> 27:08.840
- Come on! Good!
- Morrison will rebound.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.171
Missing the first 5 seconds.

27:18.781 --> 27:21.748
- Morrison makes a move.
- One more. Come on.

27:21.748 --> 27:24.545
- This will make the last basket?
- One more.

27:27.619 --> 27:31.455
And he scored a goal!
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.

27:31.455 --> 27:34.479
- Yes!
- Pacers lost by eight points.

27:41.828 --> 27:44.129
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hi, Brian.

27:44.129 --> 27:45.823
- How are you.
- Okay.

27:47.031 --> 27:48.657
Right.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.062
- Really?
- Yes

27:57.171 --> 27:58.838
I think no more
go see my money.

27:58.838 --> 28:03.330
- It is better to tell.
- Four hundred, five hundred.

28:03.841 --> 28:05.240
Thank you.

28:06.743 --> 28:08.175
Thank you.

28:09.745 --> 28:13.213
- This will help you not?
- Surely, my friend.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.915
I do not want to, thank you. I have
meeting with the bank manager.

28:15.915 --> 28:17.483
- I must set things right.
- Are you sure?

28:17.483 --> 28:20.110
- Yes, I want a soda.
- Okay.

28:21.418 --> 28:23.647
I'm still reeling
last night.

28:25.188 --> 28:26.484
Here you are.

28:28.356 --> 28:32.916
- What will you do with the money?
- I know he will. Pay some bills.

28:33.159 --> 28:36.661
Pay some bills.
How much responsibility.

28:36.661 --> 28:41.430
I'm thinking of doing
fewer betting ...

28:41.430 --> 28:43.864
if you have more
something like this.

28:45.033 --> 28:48.729
More guesses? I do not know, Brian.

28:49.469 --> 28:51.170
Almost never have guess so.

28:51.170 --> 28:53.763
- I imagine.
- We shall see.

29:06.580 --> 29:09.207
- What are you doing?
- Multiple accounts.

29:11.850 --> 29:15.284
I have more money than I thought.
Will you help me for a while.

29:15.284 --> 29:17.184
- Really?
- Just so you know.

29:25.591 --> 29:31.494
I'm working
a business out of here.

29:33.496 --> 29:34.986
Really?

29:36.030 --> 29:38.098
I posed the question, Brian.
How do you feel ...

29:38.098 --> 29:40.334
when I turned her $ 500
at $ 5,000?

29:40.334 --> 29:41.698
That's very good, no?

29:42.335 --> 29:44.936
I'm working this business
there is a possibility ...

29:44.936 --> 29:49.098
$ 100,000 for the three
in less than a week.

29:50.440 --> 29:55.432
- Come on, man. At once?
- Yes In a single bet.

29:57.711 --> 30:01.873
We've got now.

30:03.748 --> 30:08.084
This money is all I have.
If you lose, I was devastated.

30:08.084 --> 30:09.251
- I would be nothing.
- What did I say?

30:09.251 --> 30:14.654
I've heard. You do not get
back at what he does.

30:14.654 --> 30:15.916
Exactly.

30:16.655 --> 30:20.658
I know you think this bar
no big deal, right?

30:20.658 --> 30:22.488
- I love it.
- Good.

30:23.627 --> 30:25.389
I bought with my money.

30:26.028 --> 30:29.497
When I won 350 000
I'm sure the last time.

30:29.497 --> 30:32.191
I do not have little by little.
And mine. Free of charge.

30:33.533 --> 30:35.966
- I'm impressed.
- It must be the same.

30:36.601 --> 30:39.569
But this business requires
large amounts of money.

30:41.971 --> 30:43.267
Right?

30:45.439 --> 30:48.608
How to take care of the bar,
I do not have time to get the money ...

30:48.608 --> 30:51.576
to bet again.
And then you enter.

30:53.044 --> 30:55.568
I know you're telling the truth,
but is that ...

30:59.115 --> 31:01.216
- True.
- I can not do that now.

31:01.216 --> 31:04.844
Okay.
We need 100 000.

31:05.119 --> 31:07.882
I'll get the money
and send it to the right person.

31:08.854 --> 31:11.522
I guarantee you'll win
three times a week.

31:11.522 --> 31:14.691
- Three times more than that.
- Businesses will now come with a warranty?

31:14.691 --> 31:17.860
Sit in it. This is the bar.
I offer half of the community ...

31:17.860 --> 31:20.919
if the business fails,
that will not happen.

31:21.528 --> 31:23.223
It will not.

31:24.730 --> 31:26.095
Right?

31:27.499 --> 31:31.298
Only the land is worth around 300 000.

31:37.305 --> 31:40.330
His family back in a week?

31:44.542 --> 31:46.476
What would you say to them?

32:11.426 --> 32:16.225
- What's the deal, Jimmy?
- This is it. Import and export.

32:16.429 --> 32:20.298
We accept submissions in one week
and send them back in other places.

32:20.298 --> 32:23.399
We sell products cheaper
and better than competitors.

32:23.399 --> 32:27.102
Something that will always be in demand.
We're still small.

32:27.102 --> 32:32.595
But if successful, will grow.
Let's do an experiment.

32:33.206 --> 32:36.037
Do not be a problem
use your money.

32:36.975 --> 32:40.239
Like I said.
Give me a week.

34:27.475 --> 34:29.168
Hi, Sammie.

34:29.543 --> 34:31.101
- Hi
- How are you?

34:32.178 --> 34:33.579
All.

34:33.579 --> 34:36.672
Was good last night, huh?

34:38.949 --> 34:40.813
How?

34:42.751 --> 34:45.775
- Good.
- My son!

34:50.022 --> 34:52.819
- Is that so?
- Yes

34:55.559 --> 34:57.356
What are you doing?

34:59.128 --> 35:01.425
Having the life you deserve.

35:01.530 --> 35:04.089
Not that this city has given me.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.431
- You have money? And ride?
- I have a few dollars.

35:21.842 --> 35:24.401
I'll see where he surrendered
to go by bus.

35:24.944 --> 35:27.343
This is not a plan, Jesse.

35:27.913 --> 35:30.039
This is the plan I need, man.

35:47.424 --> 35:49.983
Need Money
and up, right?

35:50.960 --> 35:54.829
We can arrange it, the last time.
In the sake of the past.

35:54.829 --> 35:58.064
I am trying to start over.
I want to clean up here.

35:58.064 --> 35:59.498
I do not think stealing a car
is a good way ...

35:59.498 --> 36:00.897
I do!

36:02.100 --> 36:07.468
- Okay, Sammie.
- Seriously, Jesse. Come on.

36:15.475 --> 36:18.602
- Take good care there.
- You're in good hands.

36:20.277 --> 36:22.006
I hope.

36:23.413 --> 36:25.846
- See you, Jimmy.
- Eat.

36:47.261 --> 36:51.525
I'm with investment funds
we have talked about.

36:52.698 --> 36:56.132
No, no.
You come to find me.

36:57.734 --> 37:03.193
I do not know? What about my car?
This is a black Dodge Dart 197 1.

37:04.371 --> 37:07.168
Okay. Sure.

37:08.641 --> 37:10.198
Wait.

37:23.150 --> 37:25.549
Right. Whether in the car.

37:25.985 --> 37:29.680
How can this be?
Where to take items?

37:42.461 --> 37:43.928
That's the one.

37:45.463 --> 37:48.124
- Really?
- Yes he is.

37:49.866 --> 37:51.264
Okay.

39:43.169 --> 39:46.102
- What do we do?
- We leave it here.

39:46.737 --> 39:51.174
- But we must return.
- What? It's you who want to steal it.

39:51.174 --> 39:54.876
- I know. But going back.
- Does not matter. Right?

39:54.876 --> 39:58.044
Let's leave here and forget
this subject. The police will come get him.

39:58.044 --> 40:01.613
No. Can we change a tire?
It will take only about five minutes.

40:01.613 --> 40:04.648
I will not dirty my hands and my
knee to change this shit.

40:04.648 --> 40:06.639
Not a big deal.

40:07.450 --> 40:10.885
No joke, Jesse!
I do not do these things!

40:11.486 --> 40:14.787
If you change a tire, I promise
Will take you anywhere.

40:14.787 --> 40:15.776
Right.

40:46.807 --> 40:48.535
Does not have a spare tire, Jesse.

40:53.745 --> 40:57.202
What's this? A bag?

41:06.052 --> 41:07.815
- Jesse!
- What?

41:25.231 --> 41:27.630
- AIO.
- Hi, friends.

41:28.733 --> 41:31.098
- Jimmy?
- Yes

41:32.201 --> 41:36.227
- What happened?
- I just want to know.

41:36.572 --> 41:41.598
When he left,
see something strange?

41:41.841 --> 41:44.310
- Why?
- For nothing.

41:44.310 --> 41:48.111
Just curious. I have
make sure everything, you know?

41:48.111 --> 41:51.380
- Like, "" believes "," Jimmy?
- Must be run.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.609
- We'll talk soon.
- Jimmy?

42:03.921 --> 42:05.547
Come on.

42:42.545 --> 42:44.102
Goldstein.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.677
You bastard!

43:12.097 --> 43:14.831
I can not answer now. If you
wanted to sell me something ...

43:14.831 --> 43:17.594
Forget it. For the others,
You know what to do.

43:17.699 --> 43:22.691
Hi, Jimmy. This is Brian. I called
to see how things go.

43:23.269 --> 43:26.839
Call me when you hear this message
or so you have time.

43:26.839 --> 43:29.807
One hundred thousand dollars!

43:31.441 --> 43:34.068
- And now?
- I do not know.

43:36.544 --> 43:38.943
This is incredible.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.411
Change people's lives.

43:45.283 --> 43:49.219
- Save. We will not spend it.
- Are not we?

43:49.219 --> 43:53.621
No. Who makes the 100 000
in an open car ...

43:53.621 --> 43:56.817
is the kind of people the same
who kills you to take the money.

43:59.258 --> 44:03.523
Come on, Jess. When the $ 100,000
fall in our laps?

44:03.761 --> 44:05.228
Not ever.

44:07.597 --> 44:10.690
Please, people.
We need it.

44:16.002 --> 44:18.868
- True. But let's spend just a little.
- Yes

44:19.337 --> 44:22.472
Stay tuned. If you hear something
about what happened ...

44:22.472 --> 44:24.530
we must get rid of it, right?

44:25.441 --> 44:26.998
- Yes
- True.

44:27.942 --> 44:29.568
Let us enjoy.

45:04.498 --> 45:06.294
Come on. Meet Jimmy.

45:11.202 --> 45:13.503
Hello? Here is Jimmy.
I can not answer now.

45:13.503 --> 45:14.868
If you want to
to sell something to me ...

45:29.547 --> 45:31.015
Screw that.

45:31.015 --> 45:32.481
We have enough money.

45:33.216 --> 45:36.412
Live there. Try to look tough.

45:39.052 --> 45:40.610
I said, "" difficult "."

45:45.824 --> 45:47.950
It is far better than other phones!

46:16.976 --> 46:18.806
Let me lay ahead.

46:36.354 --> 46:37.753
Thank you.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.960
Jesus, Brian!

47:00.569 --> 47:01.936
I was almost killed with fright.

47:01.936 --> 47:07.201
- Go to a place, Jimmy?
- No, I'll call you.

47:07.673 --> 47:10.903
I called several times.
I left some tasks.

47:11.777 --> 47:15.478
Really? Do you know how
these things, right?

47:15.478 --> 47:18.080
- I know. What happened to your face?
- What?

47:18.080 --> 47:19.411
His face.

47:21.549 --> 47:23.641
Falling off a ladder.

47:23.817 --> 47:26.410
This rubber soles
almost killed me.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.914
- Drinking?
- Yes

47:48.398 --> 47:50.195
There you go, buddy.

47:52.701 --> 47:56.726
- How is it?
- Okay.

47:59.338 --> 48:01.168
- How are you?
- Yes

48:03.474 --> 48:05.305
It's not going to drink?

48:07.143 --> 48:08.803
I will.

48:13.247 --> 48:15.578
You want to talk, Jimmy?
What happened?

48:19.551 --> 48:24.253
- No. We only have a problem.
- How so? What is the problem?

48:24.253 --> 48:28.746
Okay. It will be fine.
I'll take care of it. Relax.

48:31.659 --> 48:33.455
I have to pee.

49:02.511 --> 49:06.741
Going to Baltimore?
How is the current year?

49:07.047 --> 49:10.776
I know he will. It sucks.

49:11.950 --> 49:14.509
I have some business to IA.

49:27.526 --> 49:28.992
- Business?
- Yes

49:29.160 --> 49:31.423
- And our business?
- What do you have?

49:39.066 --> 49:41.260
Also, "" what is ""?

49:44.803 --> 49:47.404
Also, "" what is ""?
I have to pay the bills.

49:47.404 --> 49:50.406
My wife and my child back
a few days! Damn it, Jimmy!

49:50.406 --> 49:55.810
Sorry, Brian. You'll be fine.
I'll be back one day. Take it easy.

49:55.810 --> 49:59.246
You said to wait
a few days and I waited.

49:59.246 --> 50:00.713
- Where's my money?
- Get out my face.

50:00.713 --> 50:03.977
- Where is Jimmy?
- Stay away.

50:05.616 --> 50:08.345
Stand back.

50:12.453 --> 50:13.784
Right.

50:14.954 --> 50:18.223
That is not so, Brian.
It can not.

50:18.223 --> 50:20.486
That's all I got, Jimmy.

50:22.059 --> 50:24.227
- I got nothing.
- Brian ...

50:24.227 --> 50:27.196
- That's all I got.
- I do not know what to tell you, man.

50:27.196 --> 50:30.430
The money is gone. The plane!
I do not know what happened.

50:30.430 --> 50:33.499
They stole my car in front.
Contact me think that I set for him.

50:33.499 --> 50:36.334
I'll find out what's going on, Brian.
I'll know ...

50:36.334 --> 50:38.168
but you have to believe me.
You have to calm down.

50:38.168 --> 50:39.567
Okay.

50:41.404 --> 50:46.430
You will leave the city.
Will get out of here.

50:46.807 --> 50:51.868
Brian will be fine.

50:55.546 --> 50:59.081
I do not believe it, Jimmy.
I think not.

50:59.081 --> 51:02.117
What is there?
Is your stuff?

51:02.117 --> 51:04.985
- What is it?
- Brian, you do the same thing ...

51:04.985 --> 51:06.586
- If you were in my place.
- In its place?

51:06.586 --> 51:08.688
I do not know
what happened!

51:08.688 --> 51:11.489
- What happens is that people ...
- What happened?

51:11.489 --> 51:14.991
- They are serious, Brian.
- I ask you a question.

51:14.991 --> 51:18.427
How to give $ 100,000
for whom you do not know Jimmy?

51:18.427 --> 51:21.696
I do not know who took the money!
I do not know anything I say.

51:21.696 --> 51:24.864
This guy runs a large network
drug trafficking in South America

51:24.864 --> 51:27.799
I do not know his name.
Always hidden ...

51:27.799 --> 51:31.902
and do what you want.
This guy is serious, Brian.

51:31.902 --> 51:34.028
- He will kill me.
- Like, "" will kill you '"?

51:34.170 --> 51:35.796
I heard a rumor.

51:37.805 --> 51:39.466
He heard the rumors, right?

51:40.674 --> 51:43.437
What he heard, Jimmy?
What do you hear?

51:43.909 --> 51:47.878
The latter tried to pass it back
just want to hang myself.

51:47.878 --> 51:52.048
Do not give me that right now, Brian.
Do not know what happened!

51:52.048 --> 51:53.378
Do not know.

51:53.481 --> 51:55.142
Give it to me.

52:24.734 --> 52:26.200
Oh my God.

54:37.416 --> 54:41.214
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me.

54:42.052 --> 54:44.144
Stop looking at me.

56:42.692 --> 56:44.056
Right.

56:47.561 --> 56:49.187
Take it. Get out of here.

56:49.996 --> 56:51.395
Get out of here.

58:03.542 --> 58:06.135
- You are right, sir?
- Yes

58:07.210 --> 58:08.609
God?

58:10.045 --> 58:13.207
Turn off the car and go, please.

58:22.853 --> 58:24.649
Right. Live there.

58:28.290 --> 58:30.450
Come here, please.

58:34.460 --> 58:36.757
Let me guess. Riley.

58:38.396 --> 58:42.888
- What?
- Car Rental Riley, 4.

58:44.266 --> 58:46.130
Yes, Riley.

58:47.468 --> 58:51.337
We see them.
They hit the car rental ...

58:51.337 --> 58:54.567
and repair costs
who hires. How unfortunate.

58:55.706 --> 59:00.698
This is the rust.
Let not protect you.

59:01.643 --> 59:04.845
I will not.
Rent is cheap ...

59:04.845 --> 59:07.108
but thanks for telling me, officer.

59:08.180 --> 59:10.205
What are you doing here?

59:10.982 --> 59:14.151
My day difficult.
I just need a break.

59:14.151 --> 59:17.608
- Things will get better.
- I hope.

59:19.588 --> 59:22.249
- Be careful.
- I will.

59:22.990 --> 59:24.581
Thank you.

59:26.692 --> 59:28.023
God?

59:29.026 --> 59:33.189
- Do not get yourself in trouble.
- You are also police officers.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.787
Oh my God.

01:03:46.017 --> 01:03:49.314
What do you want?
What do you want?

01:04:24.441 --> 01:04:25.702
AIO?

01:04:26.442 --> 01:04:28.341
Hi, honey.

01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:31.434
Hi

01:04:32.845 --> 01:04:34.608
How are you?

01:04:36.248 --> 01:04:40.979
- I'm fine.
- Sorry for the way they act.

01:04:43.452 --> 01:04:47.080
- I'm sorry too.
- I love you.

01:04:48.188 --> 01:04:51.315
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:04:52.391 --> 01:04:55.916
- I love you truly.
- What is it?

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:02.230
I think I ...

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:06.358
- I miss you.
- Also we missed.

01:05:06.699 --> 01:05:11.135
Want to talk with his son a good night?
He talks about you all day.

01:05:11.903 --> 01:05:14.029
Put him in line, honey.

01:05:14.438 --> 01:05:18.941
- Say goodnight to Daddy.
- Good night, Daddy.

01:05:18.941 --> 01:05:23.103
- I love you.
- I love you, son.

01:05:23.744 --> 01:05:26.541
I love you. Come see us soon.
I promise.

01:05:27.846 --> 01:05:29.747
Let me talk
with Mom again, right?

01:05:29.747 --> 01:05:31.271
Right.

01:05:33.683 --> 01:05:35.309
What is beautiful.

01:05:36.218 --> 01:05:37.946
Breaks my heart.

01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:40.876
What's that noise?

01:05:43.355 --> 01:05:46.812
Noise that, honey?
Probably a bad signal.

01:05:47.325 --> 01:05:49.087
Do not worry.

01:05:51.661 --> 01:05:53.389
Yesterday, when I go to bed ...

01:05:55.496 --> 01:05:59.693
really want to be here
hug e. ..

01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:06.763
That person's phone?

01:06:07.804 --> 01:06:09.395
- Brian?
- Honey ...

01:06:09.872 --> 01:06:12.237
I must go.
I love you so much.

01:06:12.841 --> 01:06:15.400
- I love you.
- Good evening.

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:31.547
You called me
about the Dodge 197.

01:06:33.553 --> 01:06:36.385
- It has $ 100?
- I.

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:42.118
I hope so.

01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:51.859
I can see the documents?

01:06:58.935 --> 01:07:00.458
Nice try.

01:07:09.675 --> 01:07:11.376
- Dude!
- Wow!

01:07:11.376 --> 01:07:14.173
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

01:07:14.778 --> 01:07:16.438
Be careful with my stuff.

01:07:20.815 --> 01:07:23.908
We're rich!
We are very rich!

01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:27.084
Class A,

01:08:19.385 --> 01:08:22.051
- You will do?
- Doing what?

01:08:22.051 --> 01:08:24.488
Are you looking for
into the phone all day.

01:08:24.488 --> 01:08:27.622
If you will be connected, do it fast.
Let's see what happens.

01:08:27.622 --> 01:08:29.724
What if my phone in the car?

01:08:29.724 --> 01:08:32.714
Jesse, you're turning
sissy?

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.221
Damn it.

01:09:10.082 --> 01:09:11.377
Damn it.

01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:15.745
Oh my God.

01:09:34.863 --> 01:09:36.091
Who is speaking?

01:09:37.098 --> 01:09:38.725
Are you listening?

01:09:39.733 --> 01:09:43.064
- Someone picked up?
- Who is speaking?

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:50.098
- Who is speaking?
- Do you have something that belongs to me.

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.738
- What?
- Where's my money?

01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:57.734
- He knows.
- What? Turn off!

01:10:00.746 --> 01:10:04.841
- What do you want from us?
- All my money back.

01:10:05.248 --> 01:10:10.184
- Anyone who says it is with us?
- I said. Are you listening?

01:10:11.219 --> 01:10:13.880
We must get rid of
money. Now!

01:10:18.624 --> 01:10:20.182
Calm down, man.

01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:24.093
He did not know you.
He knows nothing about you.

01:10:24.294 --> 01:10:27.421
All he knows
is your phone number.

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:30.229
We just have to get rid of the phone.

01:10:41.504 --> 01:10:42.732
What is it?

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:46.841
No

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:48.142
I'll find them!

01:10:48.142 --> 01:10:50.041
Damn!

01:10:55.613 --> 01:10:58.206
Yes, I'm listening.

01:11:40.473 --> 01:11:41.997
Enter.

01:11:43.275 --> 01:11:44.867
It's here.

01:11:49.312 --> 01:11:51.211
Go to the kitchen.

01:12:13.728 --> 01:12:15.490
Where's the rest?

01:12:30.571 --> 01:12:33.164
$ 55,000 missing.

01:12:37.975 --> 01:12:42.501
In addition to the 40 000 cars
HE knows what else buy it?

01:12:43.512 --> 01:12:45.380
Some electronic devices
and new clothes.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.938
- And you?
- Also.

01:12:47.548 --> 01:12:49.413
Give it all back.

01:12:52.151 --> 01:12:53.742
Or what?

01:13:20.769 --> 01:13:22.599
They have a receipt?

01:13:29.006 --> 01:13:30.633
Right.

01:13:42.014 --> 01:13:44.675
Come over here. I have
say something.

01:13:46.017 --> 01:13:48.883
You cocky, kid.

01:13:53.355 --> 01:13:55.481
Do you have any receipts?

01:14:00.059 --> 01:14:03.261
- Yes I think I have some at home.
- Good. And you?

01:14:03.261 --> 01:14:07.320
- I have several. I can take them.
- So no problem.

01:14:09.665 --> 01:14:12.030
Take the box and come with me.

01:15:37.652 --> 01:15:39.176
AIO?

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:42.388
- So you have a child.
- AIO?

01:15:44.723 --> 01:15:45.723
AIO?

01:15:45.723 --> 01:15:48.088
It binds him here
when you fall apart?

01:16:13.508 --> 01:16:16.168
Right. What phone
Your Friend?

01:16:18.144 --> 01:16:20.043
I do not remember.

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:30.449
Sure, kid.
I want to do it again?

01:16:33.553 --> 01:16:37.544
This is my last warning.
What's his number?

01:16:43.492 --> 01:16:45.927
- AIO?
- What is it, boy?

01:16:45.927 --> 01:16:48.963
I tried to return the laptop,
but said they could not accept.

01:16:48.963 --> 01:16:50.930
Make them accept!
He creates a story.

01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:53.165
His mother was sick.
His father was unemployed.

01:16:53.165 --> 01:16:54.832
I do not care.
And the car?

01:16:54.832 --> 01:16:58.602
No! I must go to all places.
I'll be back to defend.

01:16:58.602 --> 01:17:02.137
Do it, girl!
Stop procrastinating.

01:17:02.137 --> 01:17:03.694
Right.

01:17:05.305 --> 01:17:06.363
Damn it.

01:17:17.113 --> 01:17:21.514
- Do you owe money to someone, right?
- No need to talk, right?

01:17:21.983 --> 01:17:23.850
I do not know you
and you do not know me.

01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:27.182
I want that to continue.
So shut up, right?

01:17:28.486 --> 01:17:31.420
I have a bad feeling
about it from the beginning.

01:17:31.755 --> 01:17:35.485
I knew something was wrong.
Like an idiot I am!

01:17:36.691 --> 01:17:39.181
Every time I get in trouble.

01:17:40.628 --> 01:17:42.788
Maybe I deserve.

01:18:17.549 --> 01:18:19.779
You do not look like one.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.110
- With who?
- With drug dealers.

01:18:33.393 --> 01:18:36.555
Do not know
what is involved, is not it?

01:18:45.767 --> 01:18:48.860
When you steal a car ...

01:18:50.404 --> 01:18:53.239
all drug trafficking scheme
I do not have to get involved ...

01:18:53.239 --> 01:18:54.865
fell through.

01:18:59.642 --> 01:19:03.270
Should be dead
within a few hours

01:19:05.947 --> 01:19:07.675
What are you doing?

01:19:09.315 --> 01:19:11.475
Damn it, kid.

01:19:12.917 --> 01:19:15.942
If I knew,
would not be here with you.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.448
But I do not know.

01:19:43.035 --> 01:19:44.332
So ...

01:19:46.771 --> 01:19:49.898
- You go to school?
- I've finished.

01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:53.508
Did you graduate?

01:19:57.278 --> 01:20:01.474
- I've finished.
- Is there a plan?

01:20:03.348 --> 01:20:05.145
Out of town.

01:20:05.849 --> 01:20:10.376
- This is your plan?
- I do not need a lot of planning.

01:20:10.986 --> 01:20:13.545
Maybe I get a job.
See how it goes.

01:20:17.056 --> 01:20:19.046
When I was a kid ...

01:20:21.993 --> 01:20:25.962
- My parents lost everything.
- This is one story ...

01:20:25.962 --> 01:20:28.497
You overcome the difficulties ...

01:20:28.497 --> 01:20:31.665
and be successful
slums ...

01:20:31.665 --> 01:20:35.122
- Anyone who owes money to someone?
- No

01:20:39.803 --> 01:20:43.072
I have been in place.
If they give me some advice ...

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:44.439
- What has been helpful.
- Really?

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:47.669
Been in my place. Like this?

01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:55.612
Also ran.
Cross-country ride.

01:20:56.347 --> 01:20:59.542
I went after what she thought
a new life.

01:21:03.018 --> 01:21:06.953
- Wow! How do I get screwed!
- What do you mean?

01:21:07.754 --> 01:21:09.355
What I am trying to say is ...

01:21:09.355 --> 01:21:13.119
do not think that life is things
You have, because it does not.

01:21:15.392 --> 01:21:18.292
It's about being happy.

01:21:21.696 --> 01:21:25.858
For more boring as it sounds,
what matters is doing the right thing.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.357
Which is true?

01:21:30.901 --> 01:21:33.669
As a teenager chain
in your child's room?

01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:35.296
Funny.

01:21:39.106 --> 01:21:41.335
Do you have any dreams?

01:21:47.945 --> 01:21:51.213
Quantities are limited.
I will not attend.

01:21:51.213 --> 01:21:54.147
For the sake of you,
I hope that answers your friend.

01:21:55.116 --> 01:21:56.208
Come on.

01:22:00.319 --> 01:22:01.853
- AIO?
- Why is he not?

01:22:01.853 --> 01:22:04.755
The Bergman Clothing
not accept the return. No!

01:22:04.755 --> 01:22:07.390
I do not care
clothing, kid! And the car?

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:10.659
They say that they need permission
to return a value so high.

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.393
They do not have much money
available!

01:22:12.393 --> 01:22:14.261
Take the car back,
get authorization ...

01:22:14.261 --> 01:22:16.354
take the money and come back here.

01:22:17.163 --> 01:22:18.425
Damn it.

01:22:25.601 --> 01:22:27.864
He could not
return the car, right?

01:22:37.276 --> 01:22:39.971
- I have my own business.
- What?

01:22:40.877 --> 01:22:43.212
You ask
if I was dreaming.

01:22:43.212 --> 01:22:47.341
My head is full.
It no longer interests me more.

01:22:53.351 --> 01:22:56.979
Banque hostage calm
and shut up.

01:23:15.799 --> 01:23:17.527
What do I do?

01:23:20.268 --> 01:23:22.064
What am I doing, honey?

01:23:25.839 --> 01:23:27.897
I miss you.

01:23:30.508 --> 01:23:32.338
I miss you.

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.077
Oh my God.

01:24:08.931 --> 01:24:10.761
I'm sorry.

01:24:12.634 --> 01:24:14.430
I'm an idiot.

01:24:24.207 --> 01:24:26.834
So, you want to own a business?
What is it?

01:24:27.042 --> 01:24:31.977
He told me about
his dream of opening a business.

01:24:33.113 --> 01:24:37.741
Want to have your own business.
Something fun.

01:24:38.316 --> 01:24:41.045
That was cool. It's a start, right?

01:24:42.352 --> 01:24:45.411
- What if I fail?
- If you fail?

01:24:45.787 --> 01:24:47.981
It's scary.

01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:53.417
If you work hard, you can
okay, son.

01:25:09.302 --> 01:25:10.700
Hear that?

01:25:52.395 --> 01:25:55.096
- What happened?
- We've got company.

01:25:55.096 --> 01:25:57.222
Get out! Get out!

01:25:59.732 --> 01:26:01.062
Damn it.

01:26:08.471 --> 01:26:10.802
Jesse? Door! Door!

01:26:12.974 --> 01:26:14.440
Come with me.

01:26:16.509 --> 01:26:18.807
Go! Go! Go!

01:26:20.445 --> 01:26:21.968
Damn!

01:26:23.447 --> 01:26:27.849
They are everywhere.
Right. Let's go to another port.

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:29.941
Enter the second door on the left.

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:32.478
Go!

01:26:41.792 --> 01:26:44.727
- How many garages do you have?
- It. More than I need.

01:26:44.727 --> 01:26:47.895
Right. Listen.
Climb the stairs and enter the door.

01:26:47.895 --> 01:26:50.196
Go down the stairs. From the outside,
see the page.

01:26:50.196 --> 01:26:52.498
Just follow it to be
safe, kid. Leave immediately.

01:26:52.498 --> 01:26:54.733
- And you?
- Go! Get out of here, Jesse!

01:26:54.733 --> 01:26:56.767
- I get it, Steve!
- No! You can run away!

01:26:56.767 --> 01:26:58.165
Go now!

01:27:15.412 --> 01:27:16.742
Right.

01:27:41.728 --> 01:27:42.717
Jesse!

01:27:50.233 --> 01:27:51.530
What happened?

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:56.963
Damn it.

01:28:01.707 --> 01:28:03.469
Damn it.

01:28:04.509 --> 01:28:07.999
- We have to call the police.
- Why? What happened?

01:28:09.078 --> 01:28:11.807
- Jesse?
- If we can not help ...

01:28:12.214 --> 01:28:14.815
- People will die.
- So what? He was one of them!

01:28:14.815 --> 01:28:17.248
It is not. Right?

01:28:29.124 --> 01:28:30.522
Come on.

01:28:38.796 --> 01:28:41.298
- Who are these people?
- Damn! They're after us!

01:28:41.298 --> 01:28:42.788
- Damn!
- Go!

01:28:48.136 --> 01:28:50.433
- Go! Go! Go!
- Where, Jesse?

01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:53.163
Turn right here! Right!

01:28:53.972 --> 01:28:55.564
Play!

01:28:57.841 --> 01:28:59.330
Right. Sleek.

01:29:04.478 --> 01:29:06.469
- And now?
- Drugs.

01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:10.405
- Give the defendant! Reverse!
- Go! Go! Go!

01:29:59.679 --> 01:30:01.407
Pick her up.

01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:07.949
Open the.

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:27.524
They do not exist
do with it. No one.

01:30:35.668 --> 01:30:39.796
It's my fault.
They do not know anything.

01:30:42.939 --> 01:30:44.997
It was all a mistake, right?

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:50.435
I gave them the goods
and has almost half the money.

01:30:50.677 --> 01:30:53.577
Please do not hurt
my family.

01:31:00.216 --> 01:31:02.945
I'm sick.
What do you want from me?

01:31:03.952 --> 01:31:06.720
They took me to the side,
take my picture in the middle of the night.

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.482
What do you want from me?

01:31:57.818 --> 01:32:00.081
What are they doing here?
They're just kids.

01:32:04.388 --> 01:32:06.413
- Are you okay?
- Yes

01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:10.823
- And you? Hurt you?
- No. We're fine.

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:17.763
- Your partner to contact me.
- My partner? Jimmy?

01:32:17.763 --> 01:32:23.222
His partner contacted me. He will
invest in one of my operation.

01:32:24.435 --> 01:32:28.437
- Why have not they?
- Please release the boy.

01:32:28.437 --> 01:32:30.471
They have nothing to do with it.

01:32:30.471 --> 01:32:36.237
Stealing money from a designated place
is to have something to do with it, yes.

01:32:36.909 --> 01:32:40.877
Getting around town shopping
My money in front of everyone ...

01:32:40.877 --> 01:32:45.744
including competitors,
is to have something to do with it!

01:32:46.548 --> 01:32:49.744
- They do not know who the money.
- Silence ...

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:53.649
or put a bullet in your face.

01:33:00.223 --> 01:33:05.249
We are in a beautiful
confusion, is not it?

01:33:08.028 --> 01:33:13.031
Right. As I said, I can get
rest of the money. I can get.

01:33:13.031 --> 01:33:17.557
I have $ 25,000 in your pocket.
Do you think you care for it?

01:33:18.935 --> 01:33:21.203
So for all this?
Taking the drug again.

01:33:21.203 --> 01:33:24.071
- This is roughly 50 000.
- Because of You set me up!

01:33:24.071 --> 01:33:28.540
- No one does that to me!
- All this is a mistake.

01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.598
Shut up!

01:33:31.509 --> 01:33:33.806
He thought he could fuck me.

01:33:35.444 --> 01:33:39.402
All you think.
They thought they would run away.

01:33:41.748 --> 01:33:43.874
How is my picture?

01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:52.688
This could bring them into the desert
and bury them with AI ...

01:33:52.688 --> 01:33:57.624
- Everything would be over.
- Sam, that's okay. Please.

01:33:58.925 --> 01:34:03.361
I Ihes say what will happen.
One of you is lost.

01:34:03.361 --> 01:34:06.625
Get out of here
and shut up.

01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:12.796
The second, will replace Jimmy.

01:34:15.503 --> 01:34:17.834
Will work for me.

01:34:18.904 --> 01:34:23.930
And third, would be an example.

01:34:27.643 --> 01:34:31.236
- Like, "" example ""?
- You are smart, Mr. Parker.

01:34:32.746 --> 01:34:37.875
I think you'll understand.
The plane took off in two minutes.

01:34:40.951 --> 01:34:43.544
Have time to decide
who does what.

01:35:09.868 --> 01:35:11.665
What do we do?

01:35:14.572 --> 01:35:17.165
There must be another way, right?

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.208
- Right?
- Sam, that's okay.

01:35:19.208 --> 01:35:22.074
Come here now.
Come over here.

01:35:22.443 --> 01:35:24.845
Listen. I promise you
that will be fine.

01:35:24.845 --> 01:35:27.711
Well, Sam? It will be fine.
Do not worry.

01:35:28.213 --> 01:35:30.447
It will be fine.
That's all right.

01:35:30.447 --> 01:35:32.438
And if we run away?

01:35:32.816 --> 01:35:35.717
You can not. Will find us.

01:35:35.717 --> 01:35:38.120
Even if we go to the people
You are here on the plane and out ... IA

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:41.713
will come after us and find us.
Will come to us and find us.

01:35:42.188 --> 01:35:44.451
- He says we have a choice.
- We do not have.

01:35:48.559 --> 01:35:52.128
We have no choice.
Sam will be fine.

01:35:52.128 --> 01:35:53.685
Stay calm.

01:36:03.935 --> 01:36:06.335
- Did you decide?
- JA.

01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:09.467
This child is lost.
Please?

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.301
Please?

01:36:16.443 --> 01:36:19.312
If you open the nozzle,
kill all his family.

01:36:19.312 --> 01:36:21.313
He will not do that.
It was a good boy.

01:36:21.313 --> 01:36:24.338
It will not do that. Well, Sam?

01:36:26.649 --> 01:36:29.481
- Please.
- Get out of here.

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:31.680
Get out of here, Sam. Vai.

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:34.820
- Go.
- Go, Sam.

01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:37.811
- What are you doing?
- Get out now, Sam. Walking.

01:36:39.791 --> 01:36:41.951
- I can not go.
- Get out of here, man!

01:36:42.326 --> 01:36:44.193
- Jesse!
- For God's sake, Sam!

01:36:44.193 --> 01:36:46.251
Get out of here!

01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:03.359
Thank you.

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:58.564
Lost ..
Please help

01:38:29.624 --> 01:38:31.250
SOLD

01:40:04.582 --> 01:40:06.276
