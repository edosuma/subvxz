'When a child is born, the
world is altered in a instant.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.560
'A new voice is heard.
New love comes into being.

MATURE JENNY: 'Years
later we pause and say,

00:47.080 --> 00:51.870
' "Yes, that's when it all began.
On that day, in that room.

'each one was as ordinary
and magical as the sunrise -

'as familiar and different

~ PHONE RINGS
~ Phone's ringing!

01:24.520 --> 01:27.720
She's in Beauregarde Street!
Do you want a lift?

01:31.480 --> 01:34.480
Very well. If it's
going to be quicker.

01:47.160 --> 01:52.240
MOANING

01:53.240 --> 01:55.830
~ Oh, Lord!
~ She's in the back! We're
on our way to the hospital!

01:55.880 --> 01:58.110
~ What name is it?
~ We thought Nicholas, if it's a boy.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.310
I meant your wife.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.270
Oh, it's you, Sarah!
CAR RADIO PLAYS LOUDLY

02:02.320 --> 02:04.510
I told you at clinic you
wouldn't be waiting long.

How did you get here?

02:07.160 --> 02:10.470
Magic Carpet Midwifery
Services at your disposal!

02:10.520 --> 02:14.470
Mind out. I've been sick on the seat.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.590
Nothing a bit of Flash won't cure.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.150
Now, let's see what baby's
getting up to, shall we?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.800
Bottoms up, sweetie.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.070
That's superb, Sarah! Keep it coming!

SARAH MOANS

02:31.840 --> 02:33.150
Baby's well on his way!

02:33.200 --> 02:34.950
Police, love. Can we
do anything for you?

02:35.000 --> 02:40.230
Yes! You can give us some privacy!
And turn that radio down!

02:40.280 --> 02:44.240
We don't want to be reminded of this
every time you hear Elvis Presley.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.670
Little pushes now, Sarah...

02:48.720 --> 02:50.070
and one last push, Sarah.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.200
SHE WAILS

02:55.280 --> 02:58.190
Just little, little pushes
now, Sarah, just little ones.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.270
That's it, that's it!

03:02.320 --> 03:04.060
There's a girl!

03:07.640 --> 03:11.550
There's a girl, there's a girl!

BABY CRIES

03:20.080 --> 03:22.190
Nicholas for a boy, was it?

03:22.240 --> 03:25.510
I think Nicola might
be closer to the mark!

03:25.560 --> 03:28.990
It's a girl? I had a girl?

03:29.040 --> 03:31.480
You certainly did!

03:51.280 --> 03:54.080
I reckon she's going to be a blondie.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.030
Like you.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.280
And blondes have more fun! They do.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.640
Ain't that right, nurse?

04:05.920 --> 04:07.460
Absolutely.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.110
What in the name of goodness
are you playing at?

04:11.160 --> 04:14.710
All we can hear out there is you crashing
and banging. It's like Tin Pan Alley!

04:14.760 --> 04:16.630
We anticipate a newcomer.

04:16.680 --> 04:21.310
And there is neither cake nor sweetmeats
with which to welcome her!

04:21.360 --> 04:23.110
Well, that may very
well be for a reason.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.590
We've all seen how you stuff
the raw recruits with cake.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.350
They're hard to come by. We don't
want you scaring 'em off!

04:30.400 --> 04:33.910
I should think that fibrous
pottage you call All Bran

04:33.960 --> 04:35.310
would repel them more.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.830
If Nurse Gilbert wants my
All Bran when she arrives,

04:37.880 --> 04:40.830
she is more than welcome to it.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.950
It's like trying to
digest a coconut mat.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.110
~ No cake!
~ Well done, Trixie!
~ Bravo, old thing!

04:49.160 --> 04:51.430
We saved you some streaky bacon.

04:51.480 --> 04:52.670
Oh, marvellous!

04:52.720 --> 04:54.350
Born in a car!

04:54.400 --> 04:57.870
I really do believe that was
a first for Nonnatus House.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.950
And very possibly a first for Poplar!

05:00.000 --> 05:02.310
I think we were called
to one born on a bus once.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.190
And one on a platform
down the Underground.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.950
It's all down to mismanagement, poor
advice, and hospital deliveries!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.310
We'll see more and more of this,

05:10.360 --> 05:13.110
unless we can persuade women
they're better off at home.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.270
Streaky bacon?

05:14.320 --> 05:16.080
Er, no.

05:19.840 --> 05:23.070
Whilst I'm officially acting Matron
at the Mother and Baby Home,

05:23.120 --> 05:25.990
I'd like to arrange some domiciliary
deliveries for the girls.

05:26.040 --> 05:29.310
~ It would be so much easier for them.
~ Nurse Noakes, you'll never find me

05:29.360 --> 05:31.950
condemning any girl who's started
her life on the wrong foot.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.110
But are you sure you're
doing the right thing,

05:34.160 --> 05:36.030
giving over months
of your life to them?

05:36.080 --> 05:37.910
There's a flat comes with the job,

05:37.960 --> 05:41.070
and it means Freddie can live
in the country for a while.

05:41.120 --> 05:45.350
He really has turned into quite
the Mr Chesty over the winter.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.430
It's not for ever! Just until the
council find a permanent Matron.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.590
I think you're being
compassionate, sensible,

05:51.640 --> 05:53.230
and bold in equal measures.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.030
There can be no better way
to start any enterprise.

05:56.080 --> 06:00.150
And it will be nice having Sergeant
Noakes to stay with us when he
does his weeks of night shift.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.470
I'm looking forward to it.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.470
Camilla. What are you trying
to do with the clutch?

06:19.520 --> 06:21.150
I'm trying to get the biting point!

06:21.200 --> 06:24.550
But it's bally elusive
when one's reversing out.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.190
~ Do you need me to drive you there?
~ No, I don't!

06:27.240 --> 06:30.750
Your shift starts in half an hour. I'm not
needed at Astor Lodge until lunch time.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.590
Well, just turn the key in the
ignition and say to yourself,
"Mirror, signal, manoeuvre".

06:34.640 --> 06:38.310
The more you repeat it, the more
you do it, the calmer you will be.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.630
Mirror. Signal. Manoeuvre.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.800
Hop over. I'll get you to the
far side of the Commercial Road.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.350
A bientot!

07:06.400 --> 07:08.070
Goodbye.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.910
~ God bless you.
~ Bye, Chummy!

07:10.960 --> 07:13.480
HORN BEEPS

07:25.400 --> 07:28.670
Sister Monica Joan, whatever
are you doing?

07:28.720 --> 07:32.350
You say that in a tone
of such surprise.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.630
As though you are not accustomed
to seeing me gainfully occupied.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.870
But you don't need to
carry out menial tasks.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.350
There are others that will do
that. You've earned your rest.

07:43.400 --> 07:49.110
I did not rest when I was young and
I was ridden all the stronger by it.

07:49.160 --> 07:52.630
The young will not be
tempered as we were.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.830
They have an electric carpet
sweeper in the Mother House.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.950
I fear what we will find in
the girl who comes to join us.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.510
Sister,

08:02.560 --> 08:08.070
I think perhaps you are confusing
the new midwife with Nurse Miller.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.590
She has gone to Chichester
as a postulant.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.190
But you said she would come back.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.190
And she will.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.830
Before I took the veil,

08:17.880 --> 08:24.440
my mama and I would on occasion
take tea at an hotel in London.

08:31.480 --> 08:36.030
The name escapes me now

08:36.080 --> 08:39.789
but perhaps that does not matter.

08:39.840 --> 08:44.950
It had a door... that revolved.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.230
And it seemed to me

08:47.280 --> 08:50.750
the whole world passed through it,

08:50.800 --> 08:56.080
no face the same, always spinning.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.600
Like figurines in a music box.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.920
The visages became quite blurred.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.470
It can be unsettling, to see
friends replaced by strangers.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.550
But everyone is welcome here,
and all must be cherished.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.270
Remember what St Benedict said?

09:27.320 --> 09:31.870
Do you think I have room enough in
my head for every utterance of his?

09:31.920 --> 09:33.830
No.

09:33.880 --> 09:37.560
But I don't doubt you know
his teachings in your heart.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.750
I say! I'm awfully sorry.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.950
Where have you come from, then,
Princess? Buckingham Palace?

09:55.000 --> 09:59.230
No. Liverpool. I was looking for
somewhere called Nonnatus House.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.110
You visiting the sisters?
Here you are.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.670
Give them these from me.

10:02.720 --> 10:07.870
Er, top of this street, turn
left, then left again.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.830
You're to be commended for the way you've
filed everything alphabetically,

10:11.880 --> 10:15.630
but we have some post-natal mothers
who require a double appointment -

10:15.680 --> 10:19.590
one for themselves and one
for, er, baby's vaccinations.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.190
A single list isn't enough.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.240
I think we're being
invaded, Mrs Turner.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.670
~ Gangway!
~ Just pop over and see

10:27.720 --> 10:30.430
if Nurse Mount needs any help
with the developmental records.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.790
I'm sorry, dear, but we don't
allow prams in the hall.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.830
We've had too many coming in
with dog dirt on their wheels.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.830
Well, whose is that pram over there?

10:38.880 --> 10:41.670
Mine. And its wheels are clean.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.870
So's these! Anyway, I've
got firewood on the bottom.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.950
Somebody might nick it.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.470
Well, just this once.

10:49.520 --> 10:50.710
Where's your mother?

10:50.760 --> 10:54.390
Working. I've come to get the
milk tokens and the orange juice

10:54.440 --> 10:55.950
for me baby sister.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.150
Aren't you lucky, having
such a kind big brother?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.230
What name, please?

11:00.280 --> 11:02.430
Gary Teeman.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.110
I meant your baby sister.

11:04.160 --> 11:08.030
Coral. C-O-R-A-L. Like
what you get in the sea.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.630
That's pretty!

11:09.680 --> 11:12.350
Me other sisters are called
Marcy and Jacquetta.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.910
Our mum says a pretty
name costs nothing.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.100
Your mum's quite right.

11:19.600 --> 11:25.150
CHILDREN CHATTER

11:25.200 --> 11:27.600
~ Oh, Sorry!
~ Careful, ladies!

11:28.280 --> 11:29.420
Oh!

11:34.440 --> 11:36.110
Oh, goodness.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.670
Hello. I'm Barbara Gilbert.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.830
~ There is no-one here to entertain
you. They are all abroad.
~ Abroad?

12:06.880 --> 12:11.110
They are like Ariel himself - they
divide and burn in many places.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.390
I was told to ask
for Sister Julienne.

12:13.440 --> 12:17.670
She is in attendance at the clinic,
for our tasks are too many

12:17.720 --> 12:20.430
and our pairs of hands too few.

12:20.480 --> 12:24.070
Do you suppose I'm expected
there? I'm the new midwife.

12:24.120 --> 12:28.030
You will not find cake there,
if that is what you seek.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.630
I venture to suggest that
you return at nightfall.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.270
I am not trusted to
entertain strangers.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.910
I trust you.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.470
I'm new.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.990
I spent all day on a train sitting
in the guard's van with my bike.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.740
And I arrived at Euston
late, and then I got lost.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.550
And now everything I own in the
world is lying on the pavement.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.390
I need your help.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.590
And some dogs are coming.

12:58.640 --> 13:04.110
Put down the bananas. They are
superfluous to the situation.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.880
DOG BARKS

13:07.960 --> 13:09.100
No!

13:10.400 --> 13:11.750
Stop it! Come back here.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.800
No, bad dog! Very bad dog!

13:15.800 --> 13:18.030
Very bad dog.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.990
Excuse me, excuse me.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.990
Excuse me.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.270
Bring it back.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.660
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:30.560 --> 13:33.310
CHILDREN LAUGH

13:33.360 --> 13:35.280
Thank you.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.310
I found the paperwork for baby Coral,

13:39.360 --> 13:41.390
though there's none for
the other children.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.710
Her mother hasn't brought
her to clinic for months -

13:43.760 --> 13:45.550
I checked the records.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.270
I also think Coral might
have a touch of impetigo,

13:48.320 --> 13:50.990
but it's time for me to give
my talk on feeding baby.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.780
You pop off. Leave these two to me.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.910
Right then, young man.

13:57.960 --> 14:02.070
Courtesy of the National Health,
one week's worth of milk tokens,

14:02.120 --> 14:05.430
and a lovely bottle of rosehip syrup.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.310
Haven't you got any orange juice?

14:07.360 --> 14:09.550
Rosehip syrup's lovely.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.550
There are just as many vitamins in
this as there are in the orange juice.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.550
~ They put them all in in the factory.
~ Fair enough.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.070
If I put these outside for the
milkman, would he just leave milk?

14:21.120 --> 14:22.750
That's the drill.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.990
We haven't got one of those baskets.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.430
The metal ones they put the milk in.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.350
If you put the tokens on the step,

14:29.400 --> 14:32.230
I'm sure the milkman
will get the message.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.110
Is all this free?

14:34.160 --> 14:37.710
Yes. Do take something home for
your mother, if you'd like.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.040
Thanks very much.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.950
Gary, would you mind waiting
here a little bit longer?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.270
I'd like doctor to
have a look at Coral.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.030
Is she sick?

14:51.080 --> 14:52.470
No.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.070
She's just got a little
rash next to her nose,

14:55.120 --> 14:59.350
which might be caused by
germs getting into the skin.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.800
You wait here until the
doctor calls your name.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.120
Okey dokey.

15:15.960 --> 15:20.000
Oh, here. Can you manage?
Let me help you.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.910
Nurse Gilbert? Welcome.
I'm Sister Julienne.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.150
And obviously you've
met Sister Monica Joan.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.670
You will take tea before
you start your tasks?

15:41.720 --> 15:43.430
I should like to say,

15:43.480 --> 15:48.990
"Please, assert your
preference. Indian or China?"

15:49.040 --> 15:51.550
But there is only Typhoo.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.030
Should I have come in uniform?

15:54.080 --> 15:59.950
I would have changed, but there was
a bit of trouble with my luggage.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.670
There's nothing left for you to
do today. Everything's in hand.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.750
As many of you may be
aware, some months ago

16:08.800 --> 16:11.600
Dr Turner and I adopted a baby girl.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.790
I was a midwife before I married

16:14.840 --> 16:17.350
and I'm here to share some
of my own experience

16:17.400 --> 16:22.590
with regard to mixing formula and
sterilising bottles and so forth.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.350
We would always encourage
you to breast feed,

16:25.400 --> 16:28.030
~ but in some cases it simply isn't possible.
~ Excuse me.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.790
I've been reading a book that
says breast milk should be

16:30.840 --> 16:32.950
a baby's only form of nourishment.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.390
Really? Who wrote that?

16:34.440 --> 16:35.910
An American called Dr Spock.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.190
Americans are foreign.
They do it all different!

16:38.240 --> 16:41.510
You probably can't even get Carnation
evaporated milk over there.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.190
I was reared on the stuff.
My baby's getting the same.

16:44.240 --> 16:47.070
I was actually going
to talk about Carnation.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.390
It makes a splendid
topping for dessert

16:49.440 --> 16:54.470
but these scientifically developed
formulas are much more suitable.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.470
But Dr Spock says it isn't
just about the milk.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.270
It... the act of feeding
is just as important.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.430
He says putting the baby to the breast
helps the mother to bond with it.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.480
~ Bond?
~ Well... love, I suppose.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.910
I'm sure nobody here feels they'll
love their baby any less just

17:11.960 --> 17:13.390
because it's fed by bottle.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.550
I'm just saying what he says.
And what Sister Evangelina says.

17:17.599 --> 17:19.270
She always says "Breast is best".

17:19.319 --> 17:23.910
She said it when I was pregnant with
my first and my second and my third.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.150
You're obviously very
experienced, Mrs...

17:26.200 --> 17:28.510
Wimbish. And I'm not. I...

17:28.560 --> 17:31.270
I lost all three. This one...

17:31.320 --> 17:36.230
This one's my big chance. And
it might be my only chance.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.220
And that's why I want
to get it right.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.800
BABY CRIES

17:46.920 --> 17:49.030
Where've you been?

17:49.080 --> 17:52.110
Doing this and that. You look nice!

17:52.160 --> 17:54.470
I have to dress smart for work.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.350
You fancy fishcakes when I come home?

17:57.400 --> 17:59.470
Coral don't like fishcakes.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.510
Well, she'll be asleep, won't she?

18:01.560 --> 18:06.270
You've earned a fishcake if you
want it, my little soldier.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.480
Our key's on the string. Just
reach in through the flap.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.590
I did take Mrs Wimbish to
one side after the class

18:21.640 --> 18:25.870
but she was still very anxious,
even after we'd had a chat.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.230
Timothy, I wish you'd use
the waste-paper basket.

18:28.280 --> 18:30.550
We don't want pencil shavings
in our rissoles.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.990
Fretting about feeding is as much
an outlet for her other worries

18:34.040 --> 18:35.190
as a genuine concern.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.110
Did she really lose three babies?

18:37.160 --> 18:39.430
Yes, all before six months.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.790
I'm letting her have weekly check-ups

18:41.840 --> 18:44.190
in the hope it'll put
her mind at rest.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.110
I'm not sure it isn't
causing more anxiety.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.990
She's fretting about everything.

18:49.040 --> 18:53.830
Even feeding - and all that Dr Spock
talk upset some other mothers.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.950
Breast-feeding isn't always easy.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.030
I've seen women in such
pain with mastitis,

18:59.080 --> 19:02.110
or struggling to keep up a routine
when they have other little ones.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.790
What about the risk of infection?

19:03.840 --> 19:05.550
That's why I was giving the class.

19:05.600 --> 19:09.150
Feeding a baby from an improperly
sterilised bottle is very risky.

19:09.200 --> 19:13.070
No, I meant what about the antibodies
that mothers pass on in their milk?

19:13.120 --> 19:16.750
Breast-fed babies have been found
to have significantly fewer

19:16.800 --> 19:20.390
bacterial colonisations
of the alimentary tract.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.950
How do you know that?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.200
I read it in The Lancet.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.590
Your room has been aired but
it was unoccupied for a while

19:31.640 --> 19:34.510
so it might smell a little damp.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.310
It smells just like home to me.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.950
We've got wet rot and
dry rot in our vicarage.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.710
Oh, of course. Your father
is a... a clergyman, isn't he?

19:43.760 --> 19:49.470
We might occasionally have a male
police sergeant lodging with us.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.350
So you might want to make sure
that you wear your dressing gown

19:52.400 --> 19:53.990
when you go to the bathroom,

19:54.040 --> 19:56.310
which is just along there.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.550
Are you sure this is allowed?

20:14.600 --> 20:18.390
Well, I'm allowing it. I am
Acting Sister every Tuesday.

20:18.440 --> 20:22.590
Besides, we can't possibly leave
you on your own on your first night.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.710
Gosh, Cinzano Bianco!

20:25.760 --> 20:27.310
We're branching out.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.470
And it won't be Bianco for very long

20:29.520 --> 20:32.070
because I'm putting some
rosehip syrup in it.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.150
Are you sure?

20:33.200 --> 20:36.630
Oh, Patsy! We can't give
it away at the clinic.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.430
You'd think people were
paying, they're so picky!

20:39.480 --> 20:40.990
Is it alcoholic?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.190
Bianco?

20:42.240 --> 20:46.590
Not really. It's more like
a sort of fortified wine.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.390
Oh. That'll be all right.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.710
I've had Sanatogen tonic
wine quite a few times.

20:50.760 --> 20:56.670
And this is just as good for you.
It's absolutely full of vitamins.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.190
Chin chin!

20:59.480 --> 21:07.000
BABY CRIES

21:12.960 --> 21:15.920
BABY CRIES

21:23.240 --> 21:25.640
Coming. I won't be a minute.

21:28.920 --> 21:32.020
Now then. I think we
need some more music.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.790
This one, Barbara,
is especially for you.

21:36.840 --> 21:40.150
This is Billy Fury and
he's from Liverpool.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.670
My boyfriend can't stand him.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.670
You got a boyfriend, Trixie?

21:44.720 --> 21:47.270
Yes, but he's a curate.

21:47.320 --> 21:51.710
Forever being distracted by
parishioners and good works.

21:51.760 --> 21:55.150
It's an occupational hazard.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.950
I'm sorry, Trixie, but I'm with
Tom on the topic of Billy Fury.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.390
He sounds as though he's singing
at the bottom of a well.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.510
How on earth is one supposed
to dance to it?

22:02.560 --> 22:06.880
Well, you do a sort of
slow foxtrot. Like this.

22:12.880 --> 22:16.070
Do you know, I haven't
seen Tom for five days?

22:16.120 --> 22:17.190
Strictly entre-nous,

22:17.240 --> 22:20.390
if he doesn't start putting a bit
more effort into this romance,

22:20.440 --> 22:24.510
it's all just going to fizzle out.
And I'll be left on the shelf.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.630
No! No, that won't happen.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.310
You're too nice.

22:29.360 --> 22:30.630
Just you wait and see.

22:30.680 --> 22:34.190
Meanwhile, poor Patsy hasn't
got a chap at all.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.950
BARBARA GROANS

22:36.000 --> 22:38.830
We'll be able to start the Ornament
Society For Girls On The Shelf,

22:38.880 --> 22:40.710
and be the president
and founder members.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.910
Fetch the wastepaper basket!
No, don't! It's made of wicker.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.990
Oh, my good giddy aunt!

22:46.040 --> 22:48.110
Bathroom's just there.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.670
Oh, dear.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.670
Oh. Oh, goodness.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.080
BARBARA MOANS

22:58.480 --> 23:00.390
There's only one way
this is going to end.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.430
I'd get a bit of shut-eye, if
I were you. I'll man the decks.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.440
~ BARBARA VOMITS
~ And the mop.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.910
Nurse Franklin? What are you up to?

23:21.960 --> 23:24.030
I'm looking for a milk crate.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.230
I could've sworn I'd
seen one in here.

23:26.280 --> 23:30.550
Come here. You'll get everything
in a right two and eight.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.030
And there's rats in here.

23:32.080 --> 23:37.030
You don't want them nibbling
at your nylons.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.120
Here. There you go.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.840
It's got a little dial
on it and everything.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.630
What do you mean, she ate
one of those green crisps?

23:47.680 --> 23:50.550
She had some potato crisps with her
sandwich on the train yesterday

23:50.600 --> 23:52.550
and said some of them
were quite discoloured.

23:52.600 --> 23:56.990
I've a good mind to write to
the manufacturer. The poor girl
was sick as a pup till 3.00am.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.230
I know! I heard. It would
put you off crisps for life.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.430
Let her rest for the morning.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.910
And give her some milk of magnesia.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.310
That one's empty.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.600
So it is.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.560
SHE GROANS

24:17.240 --> 24:18.380
Oh!

24:30.480 --> 24:32.590
~ Morning, darling.
~ Good morning.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.110
We meet again!

24:34.160 --> 24:35.590
Of course. How could I forget?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.790
Any special deliveries today?

24:37.840 --> 24:41.790
I do deliveries most days.
And they're always special.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.590
Do you know anything about
the family who live here?

24:44.640 --> 24:47.430
That flat's been empty about
three months, I reckon.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.630
Looks like an eviction,
the way it's boarded up.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.680
But they never ordered
milk in any case.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.750
Trixie!

25:02.800 --> 25:04.590
Tom!

25:04.640 --> 25:09.390
I don't want to make you late
but can I ask you something?

25:09.440 --> 25:16.870
♪ They tried to tell
us we're too young

25:16.920 --> 25:23.800
♪ Too young to really be in love

Lovely to see you. Bye.

26:07.840 --> 26:11.830
Afternoon. My mum sent
me for the milk tokens.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.790
The name's Teeman.

26:13.840 --> 26:17.510
Oh, yes. You're down
for two pints a day.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.670
Tell your mother to be sure
to put them out each morning.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.630
Thanks, Nurse.

26:23.680 --> 26:27.310
He leaves a bit of an aroma
in his wake, poor little tyke.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.310
Lucky that will soon
be a thing of the past,

26:29.360 --> 26:31.630
with the new housing
and indoor bathrooms.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.190
I didn't notice.

26:33.240 --> 26:36.790
I think the only indoor bathroom
in my father's parish was ours.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.150
Oh, well done.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.590
You managed to get rid of quite
a lot of rosehip syrup.

26:40.640 --> 26:45.630
I told them all I drink it
myself and really like it.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.550
When did Gary Teeman come in?

26:47.600 --> 26:49.750
A minute or two ago.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.670
I put a note on the list, Barbara!

26:51.720 --> 26:54.350
You were supposed to send
for me if he appeared.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.670
Oh...

27:04.520 --> 27:05.860
Trixie!

27:09.920 --> 27:12.230
Afternoon, Reverend!

27:12.280 --> 27:14.240
Afternoon.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.230
Please be advised I had every
intention of kissing you

27:20.280 --> 27:21.430
when we first met.

27:21.480 --> 27:24.480
And I had every intention
of letting you.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.430
Scotch egg?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.790
You're like a sort
of angel sometimes.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.960
SHE GIGGLES

27:35.240 --> 27:37.990
I've looked all over Poplar for
your little pram-pushing friend.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.550
Gary?

27:39.600 --> 27:43.030
There are no Teemans on the Cradle
Roll, and none at the school.

27:43.080 --> 27:46.670
~ It's as though they've vanished.
~ And we can't let them.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.550
He was putting on such
a brave face, Tom.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.840
I know what that looks like.
And I know what it feels like.

27:55.200 --> 27:59.110
I know, because I did it
when I was a child myself.

27:59.160 --> 28:02.560
Besides, the baby had
impetigo. I'm sure of it.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.160
BABY CRIES

28:19.840 --> 28:24.070
Marcy, don't worry. I'm
just getting the key.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.200
BABY CRIES

28:33.240 --> 28:36.040
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.920
Don't worry. I'll think of something.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.680
KNOCK ON DOOR

28:57.920 --> 28:59.790
Sit down, Sister.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.390
I've decided that erm,

29:03.440 --> 29:07.590
Nurse Gilbert will benefit from
a few days at the Maternity Home.

29:07.640 --> 29:12.150
The routine will remind her of
hospital, on a more intimate scale.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.990
They're meant to be trained
when they come here.

29:15.040 --> 29:20.430
She is trained, and qualified.
She just... lacks experience.

29:20.480 --> 29:23.750
Well, the Maternity Home can
have her with my compliments,

29:23.800 --> 29:26.030
keep her for as long as they like.

29:26.080 --> 29:30.070
And I've changed the roster
so that you can go there too,

29:30.120 --> 29:31.910
keep an eye on her.

29:31.960 --> 29:35.070
As long as our patients don't
suffer, I won't argue.

29:35.120 --> 29:38.790
It... it's not really the patients'
suffering that concerns me

29:38.840 --> 29:41.510
at the moment, Sister. It's yours.

29:42.960 --> 29:46.150
I'm not suffering. Whatever
gave you that impression?

29:46.200 --> 29:49.270
You push your food away
from you at mealtimes.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.590
You've been dosing yourself
with Milk of Magnesia.

29:51.640 --> 29:54.910
And today you put your hand
to your back in chapel

29:54.960 --> 29:57.710
when we stood to pray.

29:57.760 --> 30:01.270
It's a touch of lumbago. Not getting
any younger, no more than you are.

30:01.320 --> 30:05.150
There's age and there's
illness, Sister.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.430
I would like you to make
an appointment with Doctor.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.110
To set all our minds at rest.

30:11.160 --> 30:15.070
Have I ever failed
to fulfil my duties?

30:15.120 --> 30:20.670
Have I ever failed a mother in
delivery, or my Sisters in Christ?

30:20.720 --> 30:23.390
~ No, never.
~ In which case

30:23.440 --> 30:27.430
I suggest you find something else
to tie yourself in knots about!

30:27.480 --> 30:29.790
Like the state of this building.

30:29.840 --> 30:33.280
It's Nonnatus House that's
got dry rot, not me.

30:42.040 --> 30:45.310
Am I supposed to teach you
to use hand signals as well?

30:45.360 --> 30:46.950
Sorry, Sister.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.990
I wasn't best pleased with the
way your gabardine was flapping.

30:50.040 --> 30:53.040
You are a midwife not
a can-can dancer.

31:08.040 --> 31:14.520
BABY CRIES

31:19.160 --> 31:21.910
Morning, buddy. You're
up with the lark.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.990
~ What's a lark?
~ It's a type of bird.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.430
Do you get 'em in London?

31:26.480 --> 31:28.430
Well, maybe in parks.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.640
Larks in the parks, eh?

31:35.360 --> 31:37.190
Jacquetta!

31:37.240 --> 31:40.230
Jacquetta!

31:40.280 --> 31:42.910
Fetch a cup.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.760
Fetch a cup and bring it to the door.

31:54.240 --> 31:57.040
Hold it up, Jackie. Hold it right up.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.460
Hold it up, Jackie.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.620
Hold it up, Jackie.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.510
Mrs Wimbish? There's something wrong.
There's definitely something wrong.

32:14.560 --> 32:18.670
~ She's been awake since four o'clock this
morning. We think she's having contractions.
~ Sit down.

32:18.720 --> 32:22.160
~ I'm only seven months! I can't have it now!
~ I'll fetch Doctor.

32:23.320 --> 32:27.070
This is how the others
started, George.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.320
It's how they ended, too.

32:29.960 --> 32:31.900
They came too soon.

32:34.040 --> 32:38.550
Your contractions weren't regular
and they seem to have petered out.

32:38.600 --> 32:42.750
I think we should pop you into bed
here, keep you under observation,

32:42.800 --> 32:45.510
and then transfer you to the
London if things start moving.

32:45.560 --> 32:49.270
Will they start moving? Can't
you do anything to stop it?

32:49.320 --> 32:52.720
The most important thing
for you both is rest.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.190
~ And er...
~ Anything else?

33:13.240 --> 33:15.870
~ A box of the Dairy.
~ Dairy box?
~ Yep.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.510
~ Is that it?
~ That's it, thank you.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.760
Lovely, thanks very much.

33:23.590 --> 33:24.590
Thank you. Thank you.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.070
Oi! Oi! Come here! Come here, you!

33:27.120 --> 33:30.160
Oi! Come here, you
thieving....! Come here!

33:32.080 --> 33:33.550
Come here!

33:35.280 --> 33:37.020
Come here, you.

33:40.320 --> 33:43.070
~ Come here! Come here!
~ Get off me!

33:43.120 --> 33:45.870
Yes, so you can come back tomorrow
and rob me blind again, eh?

33:45.920 --> 33:48.430
Luncheon is served!

33:48.480 --> 33:50.110
Did you make that?

33:50.160 --> 33:54.630
No. But I'm supervising
the orderly. She's new.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.550
Aren't you lucky?

34:00.480 --> 34:03.390
~ I daren't tell you what I do for a living.
~ Oh?

34:03.440 --> 34:07.000
I'm a Domestic Science teacher.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.710
Stay calm, Colette. Stay calm.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.840
Have you been practising
your breathing exercises?

34:19.400 --> 34:21.270
Sister Evangelina!

34:22.989 --> 34:23.989
Get in there, you.

34:24.040 --> 34:27.389
Got one here, Sergeant
- wants teaching a lesson.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.190
And if you don't, I will!

34:29.239 --> 34:31.840
~ What's he done?
~ Robbed me shop.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.560
Rich Tea? You must
have been starving.

34:41.639 --> 34:43.110
Fully dilated.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.429
I called the Flying Squad.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.350
I told them a premature baby
at 33 weeks is expected

34:47.400 --> 34:48.590
and they're on their way.

34:48.639 --> 34:50.590
She might deliver before
they get here.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.510
And tell me where the
extra heaters are.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.960
Cupboard off the landing,
on the left. Quickly.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.430
It's all right, Colette.

34:58.480 --> 35:02.230
Baby's coming very fast,
which is never a picnic.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.870
But on your next contraction, you're
probably going to feel the need to push.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.720
~ No, no, no, I try to want
to keep him where it's safe.
~ That's it.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.550
Watch where you're walking, Nurse!

35:16.880 --> 35:18.820
That's it, Colette!

35:21.080 --> 35:22.950
Yes, come on!

35:23.000 --> 35:25.230
Ah, that's the girl, that's the girl!

35:25.280 --> 35:27.510
SHE GASPS

35:27.560 --> 35:28.710
How much longer?

35:28.760 --> 35:32.560
Well, the next contraction,
if you can keep this up.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.910
Come on, now, come on, now.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.830
Ah, this is it!

35:37.880 --> 35:39.820
Yes, yes - come on!

35:42.600 --> 35:43.800
Yes!

35:52.240 --> 35:54.990
SHE LAUGHS

35:55.040 --> 35:57.040
You have a daughter.

36:00.720 --> 36:05.560
SHE GASPS

36:23.320 --> 36:24.830
Mucus extractor.

36:24.880 --> 36:28.390
Is everything all right?

36:28.440 --> 36:30.070
~ Come on, young lady.
~ What's wrong?

36:30.120 --> 36:32.520
Wakey-wakey! Rise and shine.

36:50.520 --> 36:56.920
BABY CRIES

36:58.360 --> 37:00.030
Can I see her?

37:16.440 --> 37:17.910
Just here.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.510
Oh, my love.

37:21.560 --> 37:24.760
We couldn't wait a moment
longer, could we?

37:27.720 --> 37:31.990
Spontaneous vaginal delivery,
33 weeks gestation.

37:32.040 --> 37:35.070
Airways cleared and
breathing without help.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.750
Where are they taking her?

37:36.800 --> 37:40.710
You leave them to their job,
and we'll get on with ours.

37:40.760 --> 37:45.320
BABY CRIES

37:48.150 --> 37:49.150
Nurse.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.070
Nurse, you're not here to assist
them, you're here to assist me!

37:52.120 --> 37:56.240
Come here, stand here. Here! Stand
there! Give the mother some privacy!

37:59.320 --> 38:01.990
I thought you might fancy a cuppa.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.910
Seeing as how you brought
some biscuits with you.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.750
They weren't for me.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.110
Not even one of them?

38:08.160 --> 38:12.790
I don't get hungry. But
my baby sisters, they cry.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.990
They can't wait like I can wait.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.230
Wait for what, Gary?

38:17.280 --> 38:18.910
Mum.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.750
She'll bring us chips and
stuff, when she comes back.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.470
Back from where?

38:23.520 --> 38:25.190
She goes out.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.270
That's no good, is it?

38:28.320 --> 38:31.510
When she goes out, how
long is she gone for?

38:31.560 --> 38:35.560
Only a night. Or two sometimes.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.870
It's like she says,

38:37.920 --> 38:41.400
everybody has to have something
that makes them happy.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.670
~ Come here.
~ Don't come near me! Don't
you bloody come near!

38:46.720 --> 38:51.870
~ Why not, son?
~ Because I know how bad
I smell. And I'm ashamed.

38:51.920 --> 38:55.110
It's all right, son. It's all right.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.760
It isn't. And you wouldn't
say that, if you knew.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.000
Knew what, Gary?

39:03.960 --> 39:06.670
Why can't I go with her?

39:06.720 --> 39:09.150
Baby's going to need to
be very carefully nursed

39:09.200 --> 39:13.190
and kept warm in an incubator,
on the premature baby ward.

39:13.240 --> 39:17.070
I keep hearing that little cry.

39:17.120 --> 39:20.550
Keeps replaying in my head,
like the chorus of a song.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.670
Well, that's something, isn't it?

39:22.720 --> 39:24.510
It's all I've got.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.160
Get it open.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.320
~ What a stink.
~ FLIES BUZZ

39:41.560 --> 39:43.960
Let's get some light in here.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.190
It's all right, everything's
fine. It's OK. Shh, shh.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.990
~ What do we do, Sarge?
~ Get the WPC. And bring their brother in.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.710
Bring the boy.

40:19.200 --> 40:20.350
I'm hungry.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.670
I'm sorry.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.630
I'm hungry, Gary.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.350
Are you cold?

40:28.280 --> 40:29.550
Here.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.700
It'll all be all right now.

40:39.240 --> 40:44.440
BABY CRIES

40:45.880 --> 40:47.030
Hello, Coral.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.350
Take Gary back to the car.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.470
Come with me, luvvie.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.590
Take our baby sister.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.480
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.640
It's OK. Sh.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.630
When the woman who did this to
her children crawls back here,

41:09.680 --> 41:12.280
you're to arrest her for neglect.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.920
Let's get her downstairs.
Come on. This way.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.030
Would you let me see
what it is, Jacquetta?

41:36.080 --> 41:37.430
I won't take it from you.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.480
BABY CRIES

41:41.160 --> 41:44.710
She's severely dehydrated
and running a fever.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.150
There are bruises on
Jacquetta's shoulder.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.710
I think somebody has shaken her.

41:48.760 --> 41:52.600
They both have fleas. And there's
a cigarette burn on Marcy's foot.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.830
~ Oh, Jesus.
~ Do you need a clean nappy?

41:56.880 --> 42:00.270
No. We need an ambulance. She'll
need intravenous antibiotics

42:00.320 --> 42:02.520
and possibly skin grafts.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.990
Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking?

42:08.040 --> 42:09.190
'Nurse Franklin?'

42:09.240 --> 42:12.190
The doctor asks if you can send
two nurses on the district roster

42:12.240 --> 42:16.830
over to the surgery. We've had a
neglect and cruelty case brought in.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.430
'We're having to get the
cleansing station opened.'

42:19.480 --> 42:23.470
The cleansing station?
Is it really that bad?

42:23.520 --> 42:24.910
I shall accompany you.

42:24.960 --> 42:28.070
It's not necessary.

42:28.120 --> 42:32.350
Once the cleansing
stations never closed.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.190
We were there so often,

42:34.240 --> 42:38.230
ridding the most wretched of
whatever filth encrusted them.

42:38.280 --> 42:45.030
It was never pleasant work, but that
it was necessary was not in doubt.

42:45.080 --> 42:47.710
It will not shock me.

42:47.760 --> 42:50.280
And it is work that I can do.

43:05.400 --> 43:09.200
This young fellow needs to
be kissed and held also.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.430
But I do not think you can help him,

43:12.480 --> 43:17.630
unless you give me that package
you're taking such good care of.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.950
I've spoken to Social Services.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.510
They said there are no
emergency foster parents

43:22.560 --> 43:25.110
who can take all three tonight.

43:25.160 --> 43:28.360
I have retrieved the
item she has cherished.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.720
~ It appears to be some species of condiment.
~ Bisto.

43:41.520 --> 43:45.080
Sweetie. Have you been eating
the stuff in that packet?

43:46.080 --> 43:47.750
I was hungry.

43:52.080 --> 43:53.750
Well!

43:53.800 --> 43:57.640
It's not quite Vidal Sassoon, but
I'm sure we can make the best of it.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.270
What's Vidal Sassoon?

44:01.320 --> 44:04.560
It's an absolutely splendid
salon, all the way up west!

44:06.000 --> 44:10.630
There are mirrors from floor to
ceiling and golden chandeliers,

44:10.680 --> 44:16.680
and the minute you walk in, all you
can smell is shampoo and red roses.

44:19.040 --> 44:22.430
However, we're also rather famous
for our shampoo and sets

44:22.480 --> 44:24.350
at Maison Trixie.

44:25.320 --> 44:28.720
We run quite a good service
for young men too.

44:31.880 --> 44:34.960
~ Hello, Gary!
~ Is the water nice?

44:39.160 --> 44:42.350
We've got rid of the fleas,
but the nits are tenacious.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.800
Their scalps are best shaved.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.190
~ I am preparing the razor.
~ No! No!

44:49.160 --> 44:52.670
~ But if it's for the best...
~ People will think we're poor!

44:52.720 --> 44:56.470
~ People will feel sorry for us!
~ Gary's quite right.

44:56.520 --> 44:59.350
There's nothing the matter
with these children's heads

44:59.400 --> 45:02.390
that a bit of time and attention
to detail can't cure.

45:02.440 --> 45:04.980
We have plenty of the former...

45:06.560 --> 45:09.160
.. and the latter costs nothing.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.310
~ Don't turn the light off.
~ Don't worry.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.360
No-one needs to sleep
in the dark here.

45:20.280 --> 45:22.420
Sweet dreams, sweeties.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.750
~ There's no need for that.
~ You do it for me

45:56.800 --> 45:59.190
every time I get called out at night.

45:59.240 --> 46:03.520
~ There's so much love in
this house, isn't there?
~ So much.

46:04.520 --> 46:07.820
And sometimes so little
in the world outside.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.190
Can I tell you something, Patrick?

46:15.520 --> 46:16.870
You can tell me anything,

46:16.920 --> 46:20.350
and I hope you always will.

46:20.400 --> 46:23.200
I miss nursing and I miss midwifery.

46:24.400 --> 46:27.600
I think nursing and
midwifery miss you, too.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.470
Don't think I'm saying
I want to go back to work.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.390
I can't sign up for shifts,

46:34.440 --> 46:37.720
I can't go out in the middle
of the night to deliver babies.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.230
But I do yearn for...

46:43.840 --> 46:47.000
.. that sense of making
things better...

46:48.960 --> 46:51.150
.. of putting things to rights.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.600
So do I.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.580
You do a hard job, Patrick.

46:59.160 --> 47:01.030
A lonely one too.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.750
But it doesn't have to be.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.790
What are you doing now?

47:10.840 --> 47:13.470
There are rules about
you and the gas.

47:13.520 --> 47:16.670
You think me likely to
cause a conflagration?

47:16.720 --> 47:19.480
Yes. Or blow us all sky-high!

47:21.040 --> 47:23.110
You are in pain again.

47:24.040 --> 47:28.550
And water will not cure
it, be it cold or hot

47:28.600 --> 47:31.670
or sealed within a rubber bottle.

47:31.720 --> 47:35.230
Soon you will be
disqualified from work,

47:35.280 --> 47:38.070
just as I am by the
fractures of my mind.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.310
You seem sharp enough tonight,

47:40.360 --> 47:44.060
dishing out advice and toasting
your own crumpets.

47:50.760 --> 47:51.960
See?

47:53.080 --> 47:56.480
You are more necessary
than you might imagine.

47:58.520 --> 48:03.240
If you do not consult a doctor,
who is to say where it will end?

48:09.480 --> 48:13.390
Blood pressure and a check
of your stitches, Colette.

48:13.440 --> 48:16.510
If I can give another good
report to Sister Evangelina,

48:16.560 --> 48:21.260
you might be allowed to sit in
a chair for a bit this afternoon.

48:22.840 --> 48:25.510
My milk's come in!

48:25.560 --> 48:27.590
If it's not my waters
breaking, I'm crying.

48:27.640 --> 48:29.990
If I'm not crying, I'm leaking milk!

48:30.040 --> 48:33.040
If I lose any more liquid this
bed will start floating.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.910
We can give you Epsom salts
to stop you lactating.

48:37.960 --> 48:40.790
I don't want to dry it up,
this is my baby's milk.

48:40.840 --> 48:44.270
I don't even know what
they're feeding her on.

48:44.320 --> 48:45.910
Please let me try it, Sister.

48:45.960 --> 48:48.670
Colette can express her milk
manually every three hours

48:48.720 --> 48:51.590
and we can take it to the hospital
to be kept in the refrigerator

48:51.640 --> 48:52.910
and given to her baby.

48:52.960 --> 48:55.790
And how much time is that going
to take out of everybody's day?

48:55.840 --> 48:56.790
My day!

48:56.840 --> 48:59.830
I can get there and back, by bike,
in not more than half an hour.

48:59.880 --> 49:02.990
And I can take the milk in
batches, morning and evening.

49:03.040 --> 49:07.760
~ You always say breast milk is best.
~ Where do you get your energy from?

49:13.320 --> 49:15.320
Oh, what sad faces.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.910
I don't like to see sad faces.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.160
Oh, look! What's this?

49:25.640 --> 49:28.350
~ Shall I press it?
~ HORN HONKS

49:28.400 --> 49:30.190
THEY LAUGH

49:30.240 --> 49:32.440
That's better, isn't it?

49:34.520 --> 49:35.990
You have a go, that's it.

49:36.040 --> 49:40.510
Well done! That's a good noise!

49:40.560 --> 49:43.100
Oh! And you! Oh, I like that...

49:50.760 --> 49:54.510
We've found them an excellent
short-term foster home.

49:54.560 --> 49:57.990
The children will be kept together,
can even share a bedroom.

49:58.040 --> 50:01.430
I managed to find quite a few spare
pairs of knickers for Marcy.

50:01.480 --> 50:04.870
You'll have to tell whoever's
looking after her that she's

50:04.920 --> 50:07.470
not entirely reliable on
the toilet training front.

50:07.520 --> 50:10.320
Please come and say goodbye to them.

50:14.360 --> 50:15.950
No.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.740
I'd rather not.

50:18.800 --> 50:22.830
Trixie. We all meet with cases
that touch us more than others...

50:22.880 --> 50:25.230
Gary and his sisters
aren't a case, Tom!

50:25.280 --> 50:27.150
They're children!

50:28.440 --> 50:30.470
And Gary was playing
the cheeky chappy,

50:30.520 --> 50:32.630
just like I used to play
little Shirley Temple

50:32.680 --> 50:35.670
when I was a child

50:35.720 --> 50:38.320
and my father had his breakdowns.

50:46.240 --> 50:49.520
You don't forget what it's like
to be putting on a show...

50:51.440 --> 50:55.190
.. wishing all the time that somebody,
anybody who can help, will say,

50:55.240 --> 50:57.510
"Is something the matter?"

50:59.400 --> 51:01.630
And hoping all the
time that nobody does,

51:01.680 --> 51:04.280
because you have so much to hide.

51:06.680 --> 51:09.980
If I could rub all that
out for you, I would.

51:11.520 --> 51:14.190
If I could take every
scrap of unhappiness

51:14.240 --> 51:17.400
you've ever had away, I would.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.030
And you can't.

51:22.280 --> 51:25.150
But just standing here, with you,

51:25.200 --> 51:29.120
hearing you say that, reminds
me that I've survived it.

51:31.480 --> 51:34.680
And that others might
not if we don't help.

51:35.600 --> 51:39.240
Now. Don't forget to tell the foster
mother about the knickers.

52:11.400 --> 52:12.670
Good night.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.260
Good night.

52:42.680 --> 52:45.110
You can tell me where my
kids are any time you like.

52:45.160 --> 52:48.670
I think you'll find your kids are
no concern of yours any more.

52:48.720 --> 52:51.670
I'll have you know I was
out working to support them.

52:51.720 --> 52:55.350
Family allowance doesn't go
nowhere when a father legs it.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.670
Where exactly do you
work, Mrs Teeman?

52:57.720 --> 53:00.120
In a licensed establishment.

53:01.120 --> 53:04.220
It's in Notting Hill
so I have to commute.

53:06.520 --> 53:08.750
The hours are good if
you've got children.

53:08.800 --> 53:11.230
When I'm at home,
I'm at home all day.

53:11.280 --> 53:14.190
I'll take a statement
from you at the station.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.550
I shall be stating that
my water was cut off,

53:16.600 --> 53:18.790
which is why this place
stinks the way it does.

53:18.840 --> 53:22.430
I'm on a list to be rehoused but
the council have done nothing.

53:22.480 --> 53:24.830
Just like the doctor did
nothing when I went to him

53:24.880 --> 53:27.630
~ and asked to have my tubes tied.
~ You're under arrest, Mrs Teeman.

53:27.680 --> 53:30.150
You'll be allowed to speak
to a solicitor in due course.

53:30.200 --> 53:32.630
~ I didn't ask for any of this.
~ And neither did your children.

53:32.680 --> 53:34.480
We did our best.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.800
We all did our best.

53:38.440 --> 53:40.510
Is the baby all right?

53:42.600 --> 53:44.600
Take her to the car.

53:51.880 --> 53:53.950
~ What's this?
~ Open it.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.310
A meringue?

54:05.360 --> 54:07.310
With a cherry on,

54:07.360 --> 54:09.110
and some angelica,

54:09.160 --> 54:12.160
because I know those
are your favourite.

54:13.480 --> 54:16.680
~ Do you want me to eat it now?
~ Not just yet.

54:22.200 --> 54:26.760
Because what I really want
to give you is this.

54:28.920 --> 54:33.430
~ It was my grandmother's.
~ What a... surprise.

54:33.480 --> 54:35.310
Don't say that, Trixie,

54:35.360 --> 54:37.870
because if it really is, it
probably means you don't want

54:37.920 --> 54:40.990
to be my wife quite as much
as I want to be your husband.

54:41.040 --> 54:42.640
Oh, Tom...

54:48.200 --> 54:51.310
Every day I talk about love -

54:51.360 --> 54:53.430
the love of God,

54:53.480 --> 54:54.910
love divine,

54:54.960 --> 54:57.030
love thy neighbour...

54:57.680 --> 54:59.950
.. all love's excelling...

55:03.000 --> 55:07.100
.. but I don't think I ever
really knew what it meant...

55:08.800 --> 55:11.800
.. until I realised
how much you meant.

55:13.120 --> 55:14.590
And mean.

55:23.720 --> 55:25.560
Say yes.

55:29.120 --> 55:30.880
Please say yes.

55:36.560 --> 55:38.160
Yes.

55:57.520 --> 56:00.190
You're looking very
spruce, Mrs Turner.

56:00.240 --> 56:04.950
I'm officially taking on the
role of medical secretary.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.630
Dr Turner is busier than ever

56:06.680 --> 56:09.680
and the practice needs
proper management.

56:10.800 --> 56:14.720
Seems like a reasonable arrangement.
There's certainly work to do.

56:16.440 --> 56:19.070
I want you to make an
appointment with a doctor.

56:19.120 --> 56:23.480
But I don't mean Doctor Turner,
I need to see a female one.

56:29.080 --> 56:31.550
Do you have... women's
problems, Sister?

56:31.600 --> 56:33.640
Yes. Very much so.

56:48.880 --> 56:51.750
MATURE JENNY: 'It sometimes
happens that new beginnings

56:51.800 --> 56:54.750
'come not at once, but at last.

56:54.800 --> 56:59.670
'The wait is rewarded and the
fresh start can commence.

56:59.720 --> 57:03.510
'But we can never know how
the story will conclude,

57:03.560 --> 57:06.990
'and perhaps that's for the better.

57:07.040 --> 57:09.390
'Baby Coral was adopted

57:09.440 --> 57:12.870
'and her three elder siblings
were sent to Australia

57:12.920 --> 57:15.910
'under the child migrant programme.

57:15.960 --> 57:19.030
'They were promised a life
of sunshine, blue skies,

57:19.080 --> 57:20.950
'and endless opportunity.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.910
'The truth was otherwise.

57:23.960 --> 57:28.470
'And the only consolation is
that hope made them happy,

57:28.520 --> 57:30.560
'for a while.'

57:48.880 --> 57:54.150
'Joy is not felt less exquisitely
because the moment flies.

57:54.200 --> 57:59.200
'And if we can taste it,
we know that we are blessed.

58:04.360 --> 58:07.550
Phyllis Crane, SRN
SCM. I am expected.

58:07.600 --> 58:10.510
If Nurse Crane doesn't approve
of the way we run this ship,

58:10.560 --> 58:11.670
we will end up sinking!

58:11.720 --> 58:14.710
~ How many years has it been?
~ Not quite 30.

58:14.760 --> 58:17.830
Still the pale, sweet girl
with the wave in her fringe.

58:17.880 --> 58:20.270
You came to a decision, Louise.

58:20.320 --> 58:21.990
I need to see a doctor!

58:22.040 --> 58:23.910
Please don't cry.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.590
You are perturbed.

58:26.640 --> 58:29.200
You strive to hide it,
but you do not succeed.
