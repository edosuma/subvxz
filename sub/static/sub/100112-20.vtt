00:04.143 --> 00:05.677
Ooh, look at this apartment.

00:05.678 --> 00:08.045
I mean, they want $1,100,
but it's worth it.

00:08.047 --> 00:10.515
Are you kidding?
Look at the size of that fridge.

00:10.516 --> 00:11.683
It's tiny.

00:12.685 --> 00:14.686
That's a wine fridge, Elly May.

00:15.888 --> 00:17.122
Oh, hey, look.

00:17.123 --> 00:18.990
This place has got one of those,

00:18.991 --> 00:22.627
and it's got three bedrooms,
a bay window,

00:22.628 --> 00:24.796
a fireplace, hardwood floors,

00:24.797 --> 00:26.297
it's in our price range.

00:26.298 --> 00:27.832
Something's got to be wrong.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.200
Let me check.

00:29.201 --> 00:30.368
Oh, yep.

00:30.369 --> 00:33.037
Sex offender a block away.

00:33.038 --> 00:35.306
But he exposed himself in a library,

00:35.307 --> 00:36.775
so that doesn't really affect us.

00:37.943 --> 00:39.744
Hey, guys.

00:39.745 --> 00:40.845
I've got a surprise.

00:40.846 --> 00:43.281
We're going to Mexico!

00:43.282 --> 00:45.550
Thank you, Jackie.
I was about to tell them that.

00:45.551 --> 00:47.552
Oh, fine, well, you tell them

00:47.553 --> 00:50.155
how we're going to
the border bridge in El Paso

00:50.156 --> 00:52.023
so that Emilio can meet Beverly Rose

00:52.024 --> 00:53.625
for the very first time.

00:55.661 --> 00:57.228
Oh, damn it. I did it again.

00:58.297 --> 00:59.564
Well, this seems very sudden.

00:59.565 --> 01:01.399
Uh, who's gonna run the restaurant?

01:01.400 --> 01:03.802
Oh, well, uh,
Emilio had a couple days off,

01:03.803 --> 01:05.537
so it seemed like a good time,

01:05.538 --> 01:08.373
and DJ said that he would cover for us
until we got back.

01:08.374 --> 01:10.875
Uh, you're aware that DJ's gonna be

01:10.876 --> 01:13.211
doing magic tricks
for the customers, right?

01:13.212 --> 01:15.446
You know what's great for a restaurant?

01:15.447 --> 01:17.849
A filthy dove walking across your plate

01:17.850 --> 01:20.585
while you try to eat a tuna melt.

01:20.586 --> 01:21.986
Gotta go. Bye.

01:25.524 --> 01:27.559
- Hey, Becky.
- Yeah?

01:27.560 --> 01:29.194
How can you afford this trip?

01:29.195 --> 01:32.163
Emilio's tÃ­as are paying
for the gas and hotels.

01:32.164 --> 01:34.599
Hey, look, I know they're
putting pressure on you

01:34.600 --> 01:36.701
to marry him and make him legal,

01:36.702 --> 01:38.670
but you're not really thinking
of doing that, are you?

01:38.671 --> 01:40.371
Becky is not gonna fake some marriage

01:40.372 --> 01:42.407
just to get Emilio into the country.

01:42.408 --> 01:43.908
My God, it would make it impossible

01:43.909 --> 01:46.744
for her to meet
and date anybody for two years,

01:46.745 --> 01:48.680
which is the amount of time
they have to spend

01:48.681 --> 01:52.183
to pretend being married
to fool the government.

01:52.184 --> 01:54.185
Why are you so wired?

01:54.186 --> 01:57.722
I just finished off
122-hour energy drinks

01:57.723 --> 01:59.224
so that I'm, uh...

01:59.225 --> 02:01.759
I'm good to drive for... 24 hours.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.828
It doesn't really work that way.

02:03.829 --> 02:05.964
They don't kick in one after the other.

02:05.965 --> 02:07.065
It's all at the same time.

02:07.066 --> 02:08.265
So now you're just gonna be

02:08.267 --> 02:09.767
on the verge of having a heart attack

02:09.768 --> 02:10.801
for the next two hours.

02:10.803 --> 02:11.936
Oh, my God, you're right.

02:11.937 --> 02:13.905
That explains the thumping in my head.

02:13.906 --> 02:14.973
It's my heart.

02:14.974 --> 02:16.007
Let's get on the road.

02:17.963 --> 02:20.164
She's such a scatterbrain.

02:20.165 --> 02:22.900
I don't know how she makes it
from one day to the next.

02:28.841 --> 02:30.374
Baby.

02:33.078 --> 02:34.178
Thanks again

02:34.179 --> 02:36.314
for the ride from the grocery store.

02:36.315 --> 02:37.381
It would've been hard

02:37.382 --> 02:38.950
walking back with all this stuff.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.552
Well, I was driving down the street

02:41.553 --> 02:44.021
and I-I saw this sad old man

02:44.022 --> 02:45.923
struggling with a couple grocery bags.

02:47.659 --> 02:52.096
And I thought,
"Hey, there's my boyfriend...

02:52.097 --> 02:54.665
and his face isn't the right color."

02:54.666 --> 02:56.934
When I get my truck out of the shop,

02:56.935 --> 02:59.070
my face will be the right color
all the time.

03:00.372 --> 03:01.472
When are you getting it back?

03:01.473 --> 03:02.974
As soon as I give 'em

03:02.975 --> 03:05.209
all the money I have left in the bank.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.011
I may be at the point
of going to the mall

03:07.012 --> 03:09.914
and hurling myself down the escalator.

03:09.915 --> 03:12.150
Well, there's nobody in the mall.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.919
You'll lay there for days.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.788
Hey, uh, you wanna
catch a movie or somethin'?

03:17.789 --> 03:20.224
I can't. I got some stuff to do.

03:20.225 --> 03:21.526
Uh, I'll see you later.

03:23.128 --> 03:25.263
You don't have stuff.

03:25.264 --> 03:26.964
Why are you trying to get rid of me?

03:26.965 --> 03:29.934
It's embarrassing.

03:29.935 --> 03:31.102
I got to go to the bank.

03:31.103 --> 03:32.503
They're foreclosing on the house.

03:34.139 --> 03:35.273
Oh, my God.

03:35.274 --> 03:38.943
Well, why didn't you tell me?
We're a couple now.

03:38.944 --> 03:41.913
We're supposed to be there
for each other.

03:41.914 --> 03:42.914
You're right.

03:42.915 --> 03:44.115
Gimme $4,000.

03:45.951 --> 03:48.052
I don't have it.

03:48.053 --> 03:51.956
But I have cleavage,
and I know how to use it.

03:51.957 --> 03:54.058
Alright, let's go.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.127
Better to have 'em and not need 'em

03:56.128 --> 03:57.628
than need 'em and not have 'em.

The Conners - S02E20 - Season Finale
Bridge Over Troubled Conners

04:35.791 --> 04:39.453
<i>"The Conners" is recorded in
front of a live studio audience.</i>

04:39.459 --> 04:42.227
Well, thanks for coming with me
to look at apartments, guys.

04:42.228 --> 04:45.063
- Wow!
- Nice.

04:45.064 --> 04:48.034
It's even better than the pictures.

04:48.036 --> 04:49.871
Look at all the architectural details.

04:51.073 --> 04:52.907
You don't get this
in the newer buildings.

04:52.908 --> 04:54.008
Oh, I love it.

04:54.009 --> 04:56.711
I'm hungry.
How long's this gonna be?

04:56.712 --> 04:58.179
You said we were going somewhere to eat.

04:58.180 --> 04:59.714
We're here. Nobody's home.

04:59.715 --> 05:01.182
Go to the fridge
and get whatever you want.

05:01.183 --> 05:05.620
But before you go, um, Darlene...

05:05.621 --> 05:06.921
Yeah, I think this is it.

05:06.922 --> 05:08.222
Alright, let's do it.

05:08.223 --> 05:12.026
Guys, Ben and I are moving in together,

05:12.027 --> 05:14.395
and if we get this place,

05:14.396 --> 05:16.531
we're legally obligated
to bring you with us!

05:19.168 --> 05:20.501
Together.

05:21.870 --> 05:23.070
W-Why aren't you guys excited?

05:23.071 --> 05:25.039
Because we've been through this before.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.542
You said we were going
to move to Chicago with Ben,

05:27.543 --> 05:29.043
and that didn't happen.

05:29.044 --> 05:30.244
One of you is gonna sleep with Dad

05:30.245 --> 05:32.813
and screw this up.

05:33.949 --> 05:37.018
Well, it is kinda my turn.

05:37.019 --> 05:39.754
You know what,
that's not gonna happen this time.

05:39.755 --> 05:41.522
Go explore, have fun.

05:42.891 --> 05:44.592
Yeah.

05:44.593 --> 05:45.927
Guy. There's a guy.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.162
There's a guy in there.

05:48.163 --> 05:50.198
It's okay. I'm Cyril.

05:50.199 --> 05:51.399
I live here.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.969
So, feel free to, uh,
look around, but quietly.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.104
I just got the bird to sleep.

05:58.307 --> 06:00.741
Relationships, am I right?

06:02.277 --> 06:03.978
Oh, uh, you have a bird?

06:03.979 --> 06:07.114
I'm so tired of hearing that.

06:07.115 --> 06:09.650
No, I don't <i>have</i> a bird.

06:09.651 --> 06:11.118
I'm <i>with</i> a bird.

06:11.119 --> 06:13.120
We share the space.

06:13.121 --> 06:15.323
We're equals.

06:18.927 --> 06:22.763
So... Cyril, um...

06:22.764 --> 06:25.366
why are you leaving such a great place?

06:25.367 --> 06:27.969
Originally, there were three of us.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.671
Uh, but Pretty Bird passed,

06:30.672 --> 06:33.207
and now it's just me
and Mrs. Featherbottom.

06:34.543 --> 06:36.744
She just can't be around
all the memories.

06:38.113 --> 06:41.115
So, how soon will you
and Mrs. Featherbottom

06:41.116 --> 06:42.250
be leaving the apartment?

06:42.251 --> 06:43.584
Uh, I haven't broken it to her yet.

06:43.585 --> 06:45.119
She's been here
since this was my mom's place.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.120
Yeah.

06:46.121 --> 06:48.155
She still hasn't gotten over her death.

06:48.156 --> 06:50.157
Wake up, Mommy.

06:50.158 --> 06:51.392
Wake up, Mommy.

06:57.799 --> 07:00.167
He would be so perfect for Jackie.

07:06.875 --> 07:09.510
Wow. Wish I had a bank like this.

07:09.511 --> 07:11.912
I took a sandwich into my bank once,

07:11.913 --> 07:14.048
and they wouldn't even cash my check.

07:14.049 --> 07:16.651
'Course, I didn't have any money.

07:16.652 --> 07:19.053
This ham represents
40 years of friendship.

07:19.054 --> 07:21.122
Jim helped me buy that house.

07:21.123 --> 07:24.058
And the day we closed,
I brought him a ham.

07:24.059 --> 07:25.393
Now every time I have a problem,

07:25.394 --> 07:27.094
I bring him a ham, and he helps me out.

07:29.331 --> 07:30.731
- Hey, Jim!
- Hey, Dan.

07:30.732 --> 07:34.835
Oh, Mr. Potter!

07:34.836 --> 07:36.570
- Uh, this is Louise.
- Hi.

07:36.571 --> 07:39.640
And you remember ham.

07:39.641 --> 07:41.809
Of course.

07:41.810 --> 07:43.210
Ham was at my wedding.

07:43.211 --> 07:46.080
See, this is so great.

07:46.081 --> 07:48.516
Big business has gotten so faceless,

07:48.517 --> 07:51.686
but you guys are just,
"Hey neighbor, got a problem.

07:51.687 --> 07:53.954
Here's a ham."

07:53.955 --> 07:55.222
Well, you know why I'm here.

07:55.223 --> 07:56.290
I just... I need another month.

07:56.291 --> 07:57.658
Or two.

07:57.659 --> 07:59.193
Maybe three.

07:59.194 --> 08:02.096
But I won't take four unless you insist.

08:03.365 --> 08:06.033
Look, Dan, I'd love to help you out,

08:06.034 --> 08:07.368
but I can't this time.

08:07.369 --> 08:08.469
What?

08:09.771 --> 08:11.505
Come on, Jim. You're kidding, right?

08:11.506 --> 08:13.407
You know they're gonna take my house.

08:13.408 --> 08:15.309
Yeah, I know that, Dan.

08:15.310 --> 08:17.278
Y-You don't think I wanna help ya?

08:17.279 --> 08:19.280
Hey, Dan's good for the money.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.749
Tell Jim about
that big apartment complex

08:21.750 --> 08:24.418
you just bid on over on Spaulding.

08:24.419 --> 08:26.020
It's huge.

08:26.021 --> 08:28.255
And the apartments all have walls,

08:28.256 --> 08:30.257
which is great for a drywaller.

08:30.258 --> 08:32.592
Isn't that right, Dan?

08:32.594 --> 08:34.227
That is right, Louise.

08:34.229 --> 08:35.663
Thank you, girls.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.900
Look, i-i-it's not up to me anymore.

08:40.902 --> 08:42.236
You know, we got bought out,

08:42.236 --> 08:44.805
and I'm just trying to hang on myself.

08:44.806 --> 08:48.342
You know, they want somebody
cheaper and younger in my spot.

08:48.343 --> 08:50.878
So they tell me what to do, and I do it.

08:50.879 --> 08:52.747
Well, they told you to screw me over.

08:52.748 --> 08:56.283
No, they told me that
you're an unacceptable risk.

08:56.284 --> 08:57.551
They got an algorithm now.

08:57.552 --> 08:59.120
An algorithm.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.621
So I'm a number now.

09:00.622 --> 09:03.758
I got some machine telling me
get out of my damn house.

09:03.759 --> 09:05.159
My whole family's living there!

09:05.160 --> 09:07.828
Where are they supposed to...

09:11.666 --> 09:13.768
That's not your problem.

09:13.769 --> 09:15.569
Thanks anyway, Jim.

09:15.570 --> 09:17.438
I'm sorry. Hey, tell Gail I said hi.

09:29.979 --> 09:32.580
Look, it's your daddy!

09:32.581 --> 09:35.183
<i>Mi amor!</i>

09:35.184 --> 09:38.820
<i>Ay. Ay, que lindisima.</i>

09:38.821 --> 09:41.689
Oh.

09:41.690 --> 09:44.159
I can't believe
I'm actually holding her.

09:46.061 --> 09:47.662
She's so wonderful.

09:47.663 --> 09:48.963
You think that's good,

09:48.964 --> 09:50.231
you should change some diapers.

09:50.232 --> 09:52.000
It's transcendent.

09:52.001 --> 09:55.003
Thank you for driving all this way.

09:55.004 --> 09:56.271
Oh.

09:57.373 --> 09:59.541
Your tÃ­as were so helpful.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.910
They even gave us little medals
with saints on them

10:01.911 --> 10:03.711
to "take care of us."

10:03.712 --> 10:06.147
I used one to scratch off
a lottery ticket in Missouri.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.715
I won 10 bucks,

10:07.716 --> 10:10.418
so shout-out to St. Christopher.

10:10.419 --> 10:14.656
We are going to have a great day.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.691
I can't wait to show you Parque Central.

10:16.692 --> 10:21.129
Oh, my mother gave me her earrings

10:21.130 --> 10:22.897
for Beverly Rose.

10:22.898 --> 10:24.966
They're real gold with little diamonds.

10:24.967 --> 10:28.336
These are so nice.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.872
Uh, I'll just put them
in my ears for safe keeping

10:30.873 --> 10:32.707
'til she turns 18.

10:35.044 --> 10:36.945
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, baby.

10:36.946 --> 10:38.947
We're in Mexico.

10:43.319 --> 10:45.620
Hey. Is my dad around?

10:45.621 --> 10:48.056
We saw the greatest apartment yesterday,

10:48.057 --> 10:49.290
and it's super close by.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.992
We got to tell him.

10:50.993 --> 10:52.627
Yeah, I brought him some beer
to celebrate.

10:52.628 --> 10:54.796
You know, it's not every day
your little 43-year-old girl

10:54.797 --> 10:56.164
leaves the nest.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.367
Uh...

10:59.368 --> 11:00.735
That's great, you guys.

11:00.736 --> 11:03.271
Uh, look, before you tell your dad,

11:03.272 --> 11:05.206
I got to give you a heads-up.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.175
He's in trouble with the mortgage.

11:07.176 --> 11:09.010
The bank's gonna take the house.

11:09.011 --> 11:10.845
Well, he talked to Jim, right?

11:10.846 --> 11:12.847
He brought the ham?

11:12.848 --> 11:14.215
Yeah.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.583
Yeah, it didn't work.

11:15.584 --> 11:17.118
He owes four grand.

11:17.119 --> 11:19.120
Four grand?!

11:19.121 --> 11:21.256
How the hell did he get that far behind?

11:21.257 --> 11:22.991
I don't know.

11:22.992 --> 11:24.959
You know, work's been slow.

11:24.960 --> 11:28.196
Sometimes things just pile up on ya.

11:28.197 --> 11:29.264
He's too proud to tell you,

11:29.265 --> 11:30.898
but I thought you should know.

11:33.035 --> 11:35.003
Damn.

11:35.004 --> 11:37.572
Just never ends for you guys.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.375
One of your ancestors
mess with a witch or somethin'?

11:42.611 --> 11:45.146
I'm not gonna let my dad lose his house.

11:45.147 --> 11:46.581
I hear ya.

11:46.582 --> 11:48.016
Maybe we could, you know,

11:48.017 --> 11:49.284
sell some more ads for the magazine,

11:49.285 --> 11:50.685
put together a few bucks.

11:50.686 --> 11:55.556
Or... we use our deposit money
for the new apartment

11:55.557 --> 11:56.624
to bail him out.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.527
Where are <i>we</i> supposed to go?

11:59.528 --> 12:02.463
Well, we could live here...
I mean, just for a while...

12:02.464 --> 12:03.965
And help with the mortgage payments

12:03.966 --> 12:05.266
just until he gets back on his feet.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.736
Look, Darlene, I know you love your dad,

12:08.737 --> 12:10.138
and so do I,

12:10.139 --> 12:13.041
but it's not gonna be
for a little while.

12:13.042 --> 12:16.978
Um, he is a 65-year-old
construction guy,

12:16.979 --> 12:20.348
and he's not just gonna suddenly
start making more money.

12:20.349 --> 12:23.584
Look, I-I'm sorry. My dad needs me.

12:23.585 --> 12:25.153
Darlene.

12:25.154 --> 12:28.323
Look, I don't want to live here, okay?

12:28.324 --> 12:30.558
We finally agreed to move in together

12:30.559 --> 12:32.193
so we can start our own life.

12:32.194 --> 12:34.162
Now, what, you're gonna
make me the bad guy

12:34.163 --> 12:36.197
'cause I don't wanna
move into your childhood home?

12:36.198 --> 12:38.299
Look, we can't lose this house.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.168
It will kill my dad.

12:40.169 --> 12:42.670
And every memory I have is here.

12:42.671 --> 12:45.640
Staying up all night,
fighting with Becky in our room,

12:45.641 --> 12:47.742
teaching DJ how to sled down the stairs

12:47.743 --> 12:49.010
on a piece of cardboard.

12:50.079 --> 12:54.248
I mean, this is the last place
I saw my mom alive.

12:54.249 --> 12:56.250
I don't want some other family
moving in here

12:56.251 --> 12:57.685
and erasing all those memories.

12:57.686 --> 13:01.089
Hey, look, those memories are in you.

13:01.090 --> 13:03.358
They are not in this house.

13:03.359 --> 13:05.093
Now, I know that this is hard for you,

13:05.094 --> 13:08.262
but it is not the kids' job
to rescue the parents

13:08.263 --> 13:10.765
at the expense of their own lives.

13:10.766 --> 13:12.567
You can't save everybody.

13:12.568 --> 13:14.102
Yeah, of course you feel that way now,

13:14.103 --> 13:16.104
but eventually, your parents
will need help, too,

13:16.105 --> 13:18.106
and I will do whatever it takes.

13:18.107 --> 13:19.340
But you won't have to,

13:19.341 --> 13:21.109
because my parents
have paid off their house,

13:21.110 --> 13:23.277
they have a fat pension
and long-term health insurance.

13:25.447 --> 13:27.448
Well, tell those arrogant bastards

13:27.449 --> 13:29.717
to get over here, grab a
bucket, and start bailing,

13:29.718 --> 13:32.453
'cause the Conners are going down!

13:35.657 --> 13:37.558
That was really fun.

13:37.559 --> 13:39.227
The people here are so nice,

13:39.228 --> 13:41.195
and I noticed the tequila's so cheap!

13:41.196 --> 13:42.830
The people here are so nice

13:42.831 --> 13:45.199
because the tequila's so cheap.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.136
Well, I'm glad I didn't come here
when I was a drunk.

13:48.137 --> 13:49.604
I would've died.

13:49.605 --> 13:54.008
Hey, you being a drunk wasn't all bad.

13:54.009 --> 13:56.310
We made a beautiful baby.

13:56.311 --> 13:58.079
Yeah, we did.

14:00.749 --> 14:03.251
Uh, well, I guess we got to go.

14:06.155 --> 14:08.756
Goodbye, Beverly Rose.

14:12.795 --> 14:14.462
There you go.

14:14.463 --> 14:16.230
Yes.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.332
I might not be there
to watch you grow up...

14:19.601 --> 14:22.370
...but I promise to FaceTime you
as much as I can.

14:23.639 --> 14:25.273
<i>Te amo, mi amor.</i>

14:25.274 --> 14:28.342
<i>Que dios te bendiga.</i>

14:28.343 --> 14:30.812
This won't be the last time you see her.

14:30.813 --> 14:33.381
I'll come back, like, every few months.

14:33.382 --> 14:35.683
No, you won't.

14:35.684 --> 14:38.319
You can't afford to,
and I understand that.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.055
I will.

14:41.056 --> 14:43.124
You'll see.

14:48.397 --> 14:50.231
Bye, Emilio.

14:57.706 --> 15:00.208
So, do you wanna get married?

15:07.637 --> 15:12.231
If you're looking for all those weird
ice crystals, so I made the kids eat it.

15:15.709 --> 15:16.876
Holy crap.

15:16.877 --> 15:18.144
What happened?

15:18.145 --> 15:21.047
A guy owed me money for a drywall job,

15:21.048 --> 15:22.949
and he wouldn't pay me in full.

15:22.950 --> 15:24.717
We negotiated,

15:24.718 --> 15:26.820
and we thought the best way to settle it

15:26.821 --> 15:29.622
was to punch each other in the face.

15:29.623 --> 15:31.591
I got 200 bucks out of it, though.

15:31.592 --> 15:32.826
Whoa.

15:32.827 --> 15:34.160
What's the other guy look like?

15:34.161 --> 15:37.430
Oh, about 6'1", brown hair,

15:37.431 --> 15:41.167
pretty good-looking,
'til he had the broken nose.

15:41.168 --> 15:43.069
Dad, you can't go around
beating people up

15:43.070 --> 15:44.270
who owe you money

15:44.271 --> 15:46.139
just to keep the bank
from taking the house.

15:46.140 --> 15:48.274
Damn it, Louise shouldn't have
told you that.

15:48.275 --> 15:49.342
Well, I'm glad she did.

15:49.343 --> 15:50.410
I want to help you out.

15:50.411 --> 15:51.978
You already help me out!

15:51.979 --> 15:54.147
I don't see anybody else around here

15:54.148 --> 15:57.750
filling up old water bottles
with gas station hand soap.

15:57.751 --> 15:59.586
I'm talking about the mortgage.

15:59.587 --> 16:00.987
You don't have the money.

16:00.988 --> 16:04.090
Well, you know what,
I'll... I'll sell my car,

16:04.091 --> 16:05.091
and I'll take the bus.

16:05.092 --> 16:06.092
I'll get a second job.

16:06.093 --> 16:07.260
I'll go back to the casino.

16:07.261 --> 16:08.928
I will do whatever it takes

16:08.929 --> 16:10.029
so that we don't fall behind again.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.264
No, you're not doing that.

16:11.265 --> 16:13.566
Your dad's right.

16:13.567 --> 16:17.070
You're not doing that.

16:17.071 --> 16:19.973
<i>We're</i> doing that.

16:19.974 --> 16:22.842
Now, together, Darlene and I have enough

16:22.843 --> 16:24.777
to pull you out of the hole,

16:24.778 --> 16:27.280
and then, you know,
we'll take over the mortgage.

16:27.281 --> 16:28.715
No, you won't.

16:28.716 --> 16:30.149
Mark told me about the apartment.

16:30.150 --> 16:32.118
I'm not taking your deposit money.

16:32.119 --> 16:33.887
I will not be a burden on you kids.

16:33.888 --> 16:36.189
No, you're not a burden.

16:36.190 --> 16:37.323
I mean, you always figured out a way

16:37.324 --> 16:38.625
to keep this roof over our heads.

16:38.626 --> 16:39.792
It's our turn now.

16:39.793 --> 16:41.327
The bank's not taking my house.

16:41.328 --> 16:43.062
You're not taking my house.

16:43.063 --> 16:44.297
I will figure something out.

16:44.298 --> 16:46.366
Don't be so stubborn, Dan.

16:46.367 --> 16:48.835
Look, we're helping ya, and that's that.

16:48.836 --> 16:50.603
I already kicked a couple asses today.

16:50.604 --> 16:52.105
Don't make me kick yours. Boop!

16:58.078 --> 17:00.213
That was a hero moment

17:00.214 --> 17:02.582
that was super unsatisfying.

17:04.685 --> 17:06.185
Not to me.

17:06.185 --> 17:07.453
Thank you.

17:11.191 --> 17:14.093
Hey, you don't think he's crazy enough

17:14.094 --> 17:15.895
to let the bank come for the house

17:15.896 --> 17:18.131
instead of taking our help?

17:18.132 --> 17:19.332
Well, you know,

17:19.333 --> 17:21.067
we've got a little time to work on him

17:21.068 --> 17:22.569
before the eviction.

17:22.569 --> 17:24.704
He's probably got about six months

17:24.704 --> 17:26.138
before the house sells at auction.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.508
Now, that's when the sheriff comes
and grabs your dad,

17:28.509 --> 17:30.209
drags him out kicking and screaming.

17:30.210 --> 17:31.878
And, of course, if he has
any weapons in the house,

17:31.879 --> 17:33.746
it could end up being a SWAT situation.

17:33.747 --> 17:35.848
And as I understand it,
if the guy has a shot,

17:35.849 --> 17:37.917
he'll take the shot.

17:39.687 --> 17:42.255
Uh, your "everything
is gonna be alright" speech

17:42.256 --> 17:43.256
needs some work.

17:45.759 --> 17:48.494
<i>! Hola, mi familia!</i>

17:48.495 --> 17:51.230
- Hey!
- Oh!

17:51.231 --> 17:52.732
How was Mexico?

17:52.733 --> 17:54.400
It was good.

17:54.401 --> 17:56.235
I dropped Jackie off at home.

17:56.236 --> 17:57.870
God, that woman can talk.

17:58.739 --> 18:00.373
Oh, she was going on and on

18:00.374 --> 18:03.876
about how she used to date
Dr. Seuss back in the day,

18:03.877 --> 18:05.411
40 years ago,

18:05.412 --> 18:07.680
but he would never reveal
his true identity.

18:08.949 --> 18:10.617
She claims she did him on a plane.

18:10.618 --> 18:13.820
She swears she did him on a train.

18:13.821 --> 18:16.155
- Heeey!
- Hey. Hey, welcome back, Becky.

18:16.156 --> 18:17.156
Hey, Beck.

18:17.157 --> 18:19.125
- Hey!
- Mm.

18:19.126 --> 18:20.226
How was the trip?

18:20.227 --> 18:21.761
Yeah, how's Emilio doing?

18:21.762 --> 18:24.597
Uh, he's changed a little bit.

18:24.598 --> 18:26.399
Um, he's married now.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.334
Sorry, Becky.

18:28.335 --> 18:29.936
Don't be.

18:29.937 --> 18:31.170
He's married to me.

18:33.907 --> 18:35.608
What the hell are you talking about?

18:35.609 --> 18:38.378
Uh... I don't know.

18:38.379 --> 18:40.480
I saw Emilio with Beverly Rose,

18:40.481 --> 18:42.315
and I thought,

18:42.316 --> 18:44.751
how would I feel if I couldn't see her?

18:44.752 --> 18:46.319
And I then I said, "Don't look back,

18:46.320 --> 18:47.654
don't look back, don't look back."

18:47.655 --> 18:49.756
And then I did...

18:49.757 --> 18:51.524
and then I married him.

18:52.926 --> 18:55.028
Wow.

18:55.029 --> 18:56.129
So, he's moving in?

18:56.130 --> 18:57.463
Relax.

18:57.464 --> 18:59.465
He has to stay in Mexico for two years

18:59.466 --> 19:01.634
while we pretend
we're in a real marriage.

19:01.635 --> 19:03.636
Then he can get a waiver to come back.

19:03.637 --> 19:06.172
Oh, you better be damn careful.

19:06.173 --> 19:07.440
You're breaking the law.

19:07.441 --> 19:09.208
They could throw you in jail.

19:09.209 --> 19:11.911
Ooh, diamonds.

19:11.912 --> 19:13.479
If you go to jail,

19:13.480 --> 19:14.514
I can wear those earrings

19:14.515 --> 19:17.116
to keep 'em safe while you're gone.

19:26.794 --> 19:28.561
Hola, Becky.

19:30.464 --> 19:32.365
What are you doing here?

19:32.366 --> 19:34.033
Once I held Beverly Rose, I realized

19:34.034 --> 19:36.202
I didn't want to miss
any more of her life.

19:36.203 --> 19:39.405
Emilio, the point of us getting married

19:39.406 --> 19:41.274
was so you could come back legally

19:41.275 --> 19:43.843
and be part of Beverly Rose's life.

19:43.844 --> 19:46.646
If they catch you here,
you'll be banned forever.

19:46.647 --> 19:48.715
You're supposed to be in Mexico.

19:48.716 --> 19:50.450
Check it out. I am.

19:51.552 --> 19:53.219
Here is me in Juarez

19:53.220 --> 19:55.822
celebrating 2021
with my New Year's glasses.

19:57.191 --> 19:59.726
Here's me in Juarez
gaining a little weight

19:59.727 --> 20:01.794
in the winter 2021

20:01.795 --> 20:05.832
and then taking off the weight
in the summer.

20:05.833 --> 20:08.735
It's a good thing
you took off the weight,

20:08.736 --> 20:11.404
because you're gonna have
to run from immigration

20:11.405 --> 20:13.339
when they catch you here!

20:13.340 --> 20:14.340
Go now!

20:14.341 --> 20:15.708
It's late!

20:15.709 --> 20:17.844
There's no traffic!

20:17.845 --> 20:19.812
I'll be fine.

20:19.813 --> 20:21.180
I'll be staying with my tÃ­as.

20:21.181 --> 20:23.583
But right now, I really want
to see Beverly Rose.

20:25.352 --> 20:26.686
Okay.

20:26.687 --> 20:29.922
But you showing up here
without telling me is wrong.

20:31.225 --> 20:33.126
This lack of communication

20:33.127 --> 20:35.561
does not bode well
for our fake marriage.

20:40.783 --> 20:43.922
<i>Bienvenidos. Bien...</i>

20:43.924 --> 20:45.452
<i>Uh, uh, uh, uh, quick question.</i>

20:45.454 --> 20:46.988
Is this where you're teaching your kids

20:46.989 --> 20:49.291
how to appropriate
somebody else's culture?

20:49.292 --> 20:51.259
Yeah, I'll bet you can't wait
to get home,

20:51.260 --> 20:52.460
"talk in an accent,"

20:52.461 --> 20:54.396
put those sombreros down on the ground,

20:54.397 --> 20:57.432
dance around them while
your kids shake the maracas.

20:57.433 --> 20:59.267
You know who can't afford
those maracas...

20:59.268 --> 21:00.802
The kids that make the maracas.

21:00.803 --> 21:02.270
Yeah, keep walkin'.

21:02.271 --> 21:04.172
<i>Bienvenidos.</i>

21:05.174 --> 21:07.809
Oh, classic. PiÃ±atas.

21:07.810 --> 21:09.010
You gonna take those home

21:09.011 --> 21:11.179
to your little entitled
white-kid family?

21:11.180 --> 21:12.480
Alright, go ahead.

21:12.481 --> 21:15.317
Shout "Ay-yi-yi,"
beat the burro with a stick.

21:15.318 --> 21:17.719
Latinos come in all colors.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.621
We're Mexican, dumb-ass.

21:19.622 --> 21:21.790
Ohh.
