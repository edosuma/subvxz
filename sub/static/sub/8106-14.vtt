WEBVTT

00:03.087 --> 00:04.879
I'm okay. Let's just go home.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.381
You're getting checked out.

00:07.049 --> 00:10.635
I tripped on the ice. Eight other kids
tripped. This is embarrassing.

00:10.761 --> 00:13.012
You said you were just going to
hang with your friends.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.557
I turn around,
and you're out there on the ice.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.059
I'm fine.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.769
You don't know that.

00:19.895 --> 00:22.146
You fell awkwardly.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.523
No, I didn't.

00:23.649 --> 00:24.816
You don't know how to fall.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.068
I'm 16.
I've been falling a lot.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.154
I think I'm getting
the hang of it. And I checked.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.118
And now the doctors
are going to check.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.912
You don't think that
you're overreacting?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.914
I don't need you
to fix every booboo.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.457
Then stop getting them.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.960
I was just playing around
with my friends. I was having fun.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.253
You know you can't do that.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.671
Oh, I can't have fun.

00:46.797 --> 00:50.758
You know what I mean. I'm going to have
a talk with your friends.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.510
- No!
- They need to stop.

00:52.636 --> 00:55.179
No, I don't want you
freaking them out.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.976
Fine.
Fine, we'll go to the hospital,

01:00.102 --> 01:00.977
but they're going
to tell you that I'm fine,

01:01.103 --> 01:03.730
and they're going to tell you
that you don't need to worry about...

01:04.732 --> 01:06.065
Mom!

01:42.686 --> 01:46.647
Mom?

01:50.527 --> 01:51.903
Hello?

02:03.624 --> 02:08.503
Mom, you gotta wake up.
No one's coming. Mom!

02:17.179 --> 02:18.679
911,
what's your emergency?

02:19.014 --> 02:22.558
We got into an accident along the Canal
Road just outside Kingston.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.310
My mom's unconscious.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.521
Are you hurt?

02:28.857 --> 02:30.358
I'm fine.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.697
Mom? Mom?

03:18.574 --> 03:19.574
Where's Foreman?

03:19.700 --> 03:20.992
He's down here somewhere.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.578
"Somewhere." Very helpful.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.581
Do you have any idea
when he's getting out tonight?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.040
Sometime.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.500
I realize you can't predict.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.087
I just thought you might be
able to estimate. It's Valentine's Day.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.714
I've planned
a surprise getaway.

03:34.840 --> 03:42.305
Get away.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.686
Is my mom okay?

03:49.229 --> 03:50.479
She's gone to surgery.

03:54.192 --> 03:58.613
Foreman, your girlfriend wants to know
if you're available for Valentine's.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.199
Act surprised.
What are you doing down here?

04:02.326 --> 04:05.453
There's a snowstorm. ER's short-staffed.
We're all supposed to be here.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.706
You're supposed to be here.
You're an ass. Act surprised.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.627
This could sting a little.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.632
- Can we hurry this up?
- Make sure that...

04:17.758 --> 04:21.093
Take your time.
What's your name?

04:22.304 --> 04:24.430
Hannah Morganthal.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.516
You have CIPA,
Hannah Morganthal.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.185
No, I don't.

04:29.311 --> 04:32.480
We have to do x-rays to make sure
you don't have internal injuries,

04:32.606 --> 04:34.148
blood tests to make sure
no infections.

04:34.274 --> 04:39.779
EEG for neurological anomalies
and biopsy a spinal nerve.

04:40.364 --> 04:44.575
Congenital insensitivity to pain is one
of the rarest conditions on the planet.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.869
There's only been
about 60 documented cases.

04:46.995 --> 04:51.248
Yeah, and I have seven reasons
to think that she's one of them.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.583
She says she's not.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.502
And that's reason number one.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.003
She knew what it was
without us telling her.

04:56.755 --> 05:01.509
Two, she's still wet from the snow.
She's not shivering. That's odd,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.886
unless she can't sweat
or feel hot and cold.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.930
The ambulance was warm.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.098
I want to see my mother.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.058
Three, scarring around
the lips and tongue.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.353
When she was a baby, she chewed
on herself without feeling it.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.771
I fell through a window
when I was a kid.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.648
Four, when you cleaned
the wound,

05:15.774 --> 05:18.317
she flexed into the cleaner
instead of away from it.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.570
It's hard to fake pain
when you've never felt it.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.782
It takes an imaginative leap,
Ms. Morganthal.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.867
That's one of them Jew names.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.204
Ashkenazis are a
higher-risk group.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.540
On the other hand,
she says she doesn't have it,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.126
and she'd be dead by now
if she'd never been diagnosed.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.587
They killed our Lord.
You're going to trust them?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.425
She wants to see her mom.
She admits having CIPA,

05:42.551 --> 05:45.594
she knows we're not letting her go
anywhere without a battery of tests.

05:45.721 --> 05:46.971
You said you had
seven reasons.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.806
I pulled a number
out of the air.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.224
What, five isn't enough?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.184
Five lame reasons aren't.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.353
I'm taking her to
see her mom as soon as...

05:56.648 --> 05:59.108
I can hit her again
if six isn't enough.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.404
Do the tests.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.909
Need to bail on the ER.
I got a case.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.497
Why are you wearing perfume?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.124
Is this a real case

06:15.250 --> 06:18.085
or one of those imaginary cases
that happen when you're bored?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.837
CIPA.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.589
CIPA is a diagnosis.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.509
Diagnoses happen
at the end of cases.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.845
She's got no idea
what's going on in her body.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.180
There's bound to be
something wrong.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.973
In other words,
she could be perfectly healthy,

06:31.099 --> 06:33.768
but you're curious
about someone who can't feel pain

06:33.894 --> 06:36.729
because you always feel pain,
so you want to go exploring.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.440
She was in a car accident.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.777
She needs x-rays, blood tests, EEG,
nerve biopsy.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.363
I also note that, although snow is
coming down in sheets this morning,

06:46.490 --> 06:49.533
you left your hat at home,
and you used earmuffs.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.951
Do your tests,
except for the...

06:51.078 --> 06:53.245
So while everyone else
was just worrying about getting in,

06:53.371 --> 06:55.498
you were concerned
with hat head.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.086
Blind dates are
never a good idea.

07:00.545 --> 07:04.840
Only reason to wear a scarf like that is
as a beacon to identify you in a crowd.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.676
Do your tests,
except for the nerve biopsy.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.887
- I need the nerve biopsy.
- You'd risk paralyzing her.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.180
It's neurological.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.182
You have no evidence of that.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.934
She tripped.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.812
Do you have any evidence,
other than the fact

07:17.938 --> 07:21.065
that a typically clumsy CIPA patient
tripped on an icy day?

07:23.610 --> 07:26.904
If the EEG reveals a problem,
we can talk then.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.202
Could have left the scarf
at home and just told him

07:33.328 --> 07:35.204
you'd be wearing
a look of desperation.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.502
Spiking on leads C-3 and O-2.

07:41.628 --> 07:42.670
She could be going into
a seizure.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.089
Hello?
I think there's a simpler explanation.

07:45.215 --> 07:50.010
You're not going to find anything.
I'm fine! I want to see my mom!

07:50.929 --> 07:52.096
So sedate her.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.597
She won't consent.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.890
She's a teenager.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.892
No dad.
Mom's still in surgery.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.061
What do you want us to do?
Hold her down?

07:59.187 --> 08:02.064
Well, only until you inject her with a
sedative. Then you can let her go.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.399
We tried.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.525
Seriously?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.528
She's strong and doesn't care.
We'd have broken something

08:07.654 --> 08:09.530
before we can get her to sit
still enough to inject her.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.283
So break her arm.
She won't mind.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.161
- You're cranky.
- I'm in pain.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.873
Come on,
let's go break her arm.

08:21.626 --> 08:25.504
Nurse Shortie, your biznitch, how long
are you going to waste her time?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.298
I'm so glad
we're walking somewhere.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.133
Another 60 feet,
and this conversation is over.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.760
When you guys are out of this program,
Cameron will find somebody,

08:31.887 --> 08:35.472
Chase will find eight somebodies,
and you'll be alone.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.600
Thirty feet.
You'll date, and you'll date,

08:37.726 --> 08:40.436
but you're the ultimate Darwinian.
You have to fight for everything.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.479
- Anybody else would just slow you down.
- Yeah.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.564
I'm still with her, aren't I?

08:43.690 --> 08:44.773
Yeah.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.651
I can only imagine it's because she
hasn't given you an excuse to break up,

08:47.777 --> 08:51.238
and you don't have the guts
to recognize your own reality.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.575
I want to see my mother.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.701
Hi again.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.787
I'm sure I could say this
without being condescending,

08:58.914 --> 09:01.081
but then you'd get the false impression
that I respect you,

09:01.208 --> 09:05.711
so you're a kid, you're scared,
you're stalling, grow up.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.631
I'm not scared.
I'm never scared.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.217
See? How juvenile was that?

09:11.343 --> 09:14.386
You can't feel pain.
Nothing left but pleasure.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.305
Why don't you tell me
how wonderful that is?

09:16.431 --> 09:17.514
It sucks.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.016
Better than being
in pain all the time.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.726
Get in the chair.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.686
Every morning,
I have to check my eyes

09:22.812 --> 09:24.730
to make sure I didn't scratch a cornea
in my sleep.

09:24.856 --> 09:28.108
Oh, God, stop.
I'm in a pool of tears here.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.401
I can't cry.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.611
Neither can I.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.491
Every morning,
I check my eyes for jaundice

09:35.617 --> 09:37.660
in case the Vicodin's
finally shot my liver.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.496
I can't run anywhere
without examining all my toes

09:40.622 --> 09:42.581
- for swelling.
- I can't run.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.167
Boys can't hold me
for too long because I can overheat.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.003
Girls can't hold me for too long because
I only pay for an hour.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.299
I need an alarm on my watch
to remind me to go to the bathroom.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.843
Know how many humiliating
experiences before I thought of that?

09:54.970 --> 09:57.846
Bathroom is 50 feet
from my office. Every drink of water,

09:57.973 --> 09:59.223
I weigh the pros and cons.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.475
After everything I do,
I self-check.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.770
Mouth, tongue, gums for cuts, count
teeth, check temperature,

10:04.896 --> 10:07.815
fingers, toes and joints
for swelling, skin for bruises.

10:07.941 --> 10:08.816
I got shot.

10:14.572 --> 10:18.117
I sat on a stove when I was three.
Want to see the coil marks?

10:18.243 --> 10:19.743
- Yeah.
- You think I'm lying?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.662
You think I would just want to
check out your tuchus,

10:21.788 --> 10:23.664
as your people would say?

10:31.673 --> 10:37.219
Put her in the chair and run the test.
If she moves again, give her nitrous.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.722
You weren't shot because of leg pain.
You were shot because you're a jerk.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.308
Some think
the two are connected.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.442
He didn't have to do that.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.068
Yeah, he did.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.486
I'm sick?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.447
No, your EEG was normal.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.365
X-ray showed no break.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.409
Blood tests showed no infections.
Urine indicated no...

11:01.703 --> 11:02.619
Hannah?

11:04.497 --> 11:07.374
Call a code! Oh, God.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.877
Need ice packs
and cooling blankets.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.297
- Got saline in there?
- She's not flushed.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.631
She's not sweating.
You must be...

11:14.758 --> 11:15.966
She has a temperature of 105.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.402
Wow, she's actually sick.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.155
We got her temperature down below
boiling. It could be infection.

11:38.281 --> 11:41.533
No, LP showed normal proteins
and no white blood cells.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.911
High bilirubin.
Could be a liver problem.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.789
- Nope, transaminases were normal.
- Could be drugs.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.415
She's smoked pot
since she was 11.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.125
No again.
Tox screen was clean.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.543
We're doing
this case backwards.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.087
We do the tests,
and then she gets sick?

11:53.213 --> 11:56.173
Maybe we did something to her.
Maybe she got sick after the tests.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.092
We should rerun them.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.303
And biopsy a spinal nerve.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.349
You want to risk paralysis
because she's got a fever?

12:06.267 --> 12:09.478
I want to risk paralysis because I don't
know what's causing the fever.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.313
- If it's neurological...
- It's a fever.

12:11.439 --> 12:15.943
In a CIPA patient. Obviously things are
different in her upstairs wiring.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.070
And have been since
the day she was born.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.696
Yeah, it's much more likely

12:19.823 --> 12:22.408
that whatever it is was cleverly
waiting and hiding

12:22.534 --> 12:23.700
until you guys
were done testing.

12:24.077 --> 12:24.910
Where are you going?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.371
You're all against this,
right?

12:27.539 --> 12:31.500
And you're all going to stand on
principle and refuse to do it, right?

12:32.794 --> 12:35.337
I'm going to get
Cuddy's approval.

12:37.882 --> 12:41.260
How long are we going to keep
Hannah in the dark about her mother?

12:41.386 --> 12:42.886
Long as possible.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.305
Side airbags
should be standard.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.266
I'm sure she'll agree.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.061
She should know
her mother's situation.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.524
Breaking that news
is that surgeon's problem.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.693
Any word from House?

12:57.819 --> 12:58.902
No.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.239
Well, maybe Cuddy will say no.

13:02.782 --> 13:03.782
Cuddy never says no.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.117
That's not true.

13:05.243 --> 13:08.162
Nobody ever says no.
We don't say no.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.413
You don't say no.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.582
He'll come back.
He'll browbeat us.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.625
He'll give us seven reasons,
and eventually we'll fold.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.794
We all will, not just me.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.882
The only way we can avoid biopsying
this kid's spine

13:20.008 --> 13:21.508
is to find the answer
some other way.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.510
All the tests were negative.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.761
We need a better history.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.555
How much more paperwork
do you need?

13:26.681 --> 13:29.558
We've got pediatric records,
a few dozen ER records,

13:29.684 --> 13:31.810
our own admission
questionnaire.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.479
What's the first question?

13:33.605 --> 13:35.439
Insurance coverage.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.648
Okay, second question.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.567
Just make your point.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.653
"Where does it hurt?"

13:42.030 --> 13:43.906
If we knew where it hurt,
we could diagnose her.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.241
You do know CIPA means
she can't feel pain.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.119
No, CIPA means she's
insensitive to pain.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.538
She still has scattered nerve fibers
that could conduct pain,

13:51.664 --> 13:53.582
but the signals don't make
it to the brain.

13:54.209 --> 13:58.587
What if we give her more
pain signals, a lot more pain signals?

13:58.713 --> 14:00.255
Maybe some of them
will make it through.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.548
You want to torture her?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.467
No.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.428
Yes, we do this
to anybody else, it's torture.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.972
Doing it to her
is no different than pricking a finger.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.391
We keep poking sharp sticks
into her,

14:11.518 --> 14:16.355
eventually we'll find the part
that's already tender.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.902
So what does
a Dean of Medicine do?

14:22.028 --> 14:24.279
Oh, can we please
not talk about that?

14:24.405 --> 14:27.449
I will talk about anything else.
I'm just trying to get away from work.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.995
Metaphorically, because geographically,
the coffee place

14:32.121 --> 14:33.455
around the corner from the hospital

14:33.581 --> 14:35.249
probably isn't the furthest you could
get.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.625
Well, the snow!

14:36.751 --> 14:37.876
The roads are clearing,

14:38.920 --> 14:42.047
but it's a good place
to beat a retreat from.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.093
You usually expect
your dates to go wrong?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.387
Experience has taught me
to have an escape route.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.931
Well, low expectations,
that's in my favor.

14:59.274 --> 15:02.150
Whatever happens,
I need you to understand

15:02.277 --> 15:05.988
that there are certain aspects to my
life I'm not happy about.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.782
Need a nerve biopsy.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.994
And you had to come here
personally to tell me that?

15:12.120 --> 15:13.537
And how did you even know
I was here?

15:13.663 --> 15:14.621
I had to bring the file,

15:15.748 --> 15:19.668
and this was the most noncommittal
location in walking distance.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.338
You left your car keys
in your desk. Greg House.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.550
You two must have met online.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.343
Either that, or you've got a friend
who secretly hates you.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.431
Don Herrick.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.269
Yeah, we connected through
SingleBallroomDanceLovers.com.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.066
Why would he volunteer
that information?

15:43.526 --> 15:44.568
Why would I hide it?

15:44.694 --> 15:47.946
You didn't tell him that anything he
said would be held against you?

15:48.448 --> 15:49.573
So what line of work
are you in?

15:49.824 --> 15:52.909
Auto maintenance,
changing oil and filters.

15:53.703 --> 15:57.497
Great, 'cause my place overcharges.
Can't trust anything you guys say.

15:57.624 --> 15:58.624
Where are you located?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.835
In 14 states.
I own Eastern Lube.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.552
Most CIPA complications
are infection, and she's got a fever.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.554
LP? Urine?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.306
Clean. Normal.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.266
Same with
the white-blood-cell count.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.268
- Cancer?
- Nothing on the scan.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.479
I think it's her nerves
messing with the temperature control.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.898
Amyloid, sarcoid,
there's a lot of candidates.

16:23.441 --> 16:24.775
I want a biopsy.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.069
Fine, if that's what
you need, go get it.

16:31.741 --> 16:32.824
He seems a lot nicer

16:32.950 --> 16:36.203
than that one
from WiccaNeedsADaddyFigure.com.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.339
One of these is warm,

16:47.465 --> 16:50.384
and the other is very hot.

16:51.386 --> 16:56.181
Start here. Move to the hot one.
Just a few seconds, then back.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.517
We're going to monitor activity
in your brain while you do it.

16:59.644 --> 17:04.398
If you feel any response to the heat,
it could indicate a vascular problem.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.947
How's my mom doing?

17:12.073 --> 17:14.741
She's okay.
Do you feel anything?

17:15.368 --> 17:16.785
No.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.162
What does "okay" mean?

17:19.706 --> 17:20.914
She's still in surgery.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.332
They tell me it's going okay.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.209
Can you take your hand out?

17:24.335 --> 17:25.752
And you didn't
ask anything else?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.171
Take your hand
out of the water.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.757
What's going on
with my mother?

17:33.302 --> 17:34.261
Hannah!

17:36.472 --> 17:38.974
You just got
second-degree burns.

17:39.934 --> 17:43.895
I'll be fine. What's going on
with my mother? Is she going to die?

17:44.021 --> 17:46.440
They said she's okay.
Surgery this long

17:46.566 --> 17:48.859
is typical when there are
internal injuries.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.238
Naloxone and
kinase proteins in.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.449
And that's going to make
me feel pain?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.118
I didn't feel anything when you guys
screwed this thing into my head.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.663
It'll replace missing chemicals in your
nerves, heighten sensitivity.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.623
We're going to be drilling
directly into your skull.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.752
A response should
indicate sarcoma.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.420
What does it feel like?

18:08.546 --> 18:10.505
It hurts.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.800
I'm sorry.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.680
Bone pain is the worst
there is, so you need

18:18.806 --> 18:20.474
to let me know as soon
as you feel anything.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.684
She's ready.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.521
So, what, I just sit here
while you guys drill a hole in me?

18:29.192 --> 18:30.192
You wanna talk?

18:32.195 --> 18:35.697
Just you and your mom, huh?
You two must be pretty close.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.743
We were, until I got arrested.
Third time.

18:40.411 --> 18:41.912
- Drugs?
- Fights.

18:43.164 --> 18:43.997
You got an advantage.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.333
Not really.
Never know when to stop.

18:47.001 --> 18:51.046
You piss a lot of people off, or are you
just trying to piss off your mom?

18:51.172 --> 18:53.673
Those are pretty much
the only two choices you have.

18:58.471 --> 19:03.308
Hannah? You want us to stop?
Stop the drill! Stop the drill!

19:11.734 --> 19:13.902
It's okay. What did you feel?

19:15.279 --> 19:18.865
Where did you feel it? Hannah, I need to
know how it hurt.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.499
Hannah!

19:33.005 --> 19:35.966
I am so tired of this.
Did you know

19:36.092 --> 19:38.844
that the new nurse from Cardiology is
sleeping with that weird lawyer

19:38.970 --> 19:39.970
from the board?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.137
The guy with 11 fingers?

19:41.889 --> 19:43.056
He has 11 fingers?

19:43.975 --> 19:45.392
How do you not notice that?

19:47.228 --> 19:49.312
The nurse used to be a man.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.274
- She's not anymore?
- But we can't talk about that.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.192
- I thought we were.
- We were supposed to talk about that.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.863
I came here to talk about that, but on
the way up, I ran into Cameron.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.282
You've got a CIPA patient?

20:00.408 --> 20:02.325
Tranny nurse
is more interesting.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.662
Oh, it's way more interesting, but
instead I've got to be your conscience.

20:05.788 --> 20:08.331
I'm tired of being your conscience.
I don't enjoy being your conscience.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.000
- No one enjoys...
- You're studying her.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.251
She's actually sick.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.587
Which you found out
after you took her on.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.798
I was curious. Since I'm not a cat,
that's not dangerous.

20:16.924 --> 20:20.135
I don't think that metaphor was designed
to actually warn cats.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.387
You don't care about her illness.
You care about CIPA,

20:22.513 --> 20:25.807
which means your focus is going to be
on getting your answers, not hers.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.393
Thank you.
Forewarned is forearmed.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.228
What do you think
you're going to figure out?

20:30.354 --> 20:34.357
Do you think her lack of pain is
somehow the answer to your pain?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.943
I think if you'd stop
talking to Cameron,

20:37.069 --> 20:40.614
then right now we could be
ranking nurses in order of do-ability.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.033
- I need you.
- What did the nerve biopsy show?

20:43.159 --> 20:44.284
- Never did it.
- Well, then do it.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.785
- Can't.
- Why?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.537
She's gonna jump off
the lobby balcony.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.581
You think I can catch her?

20:54.378 --> 20:56.421
- Get away from me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

20:56.547 --> 20:59.257
Yes, you are.
You're just jealous I can do anything.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.301
Hannah, you're having
a paranoid delusion.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.302
I don't believe you.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.762
Did you think she would?

21:03.888 --> 21:07.265
This is real. You want me to be in pain.
You even said so.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.893
If we wanted to hurt you,
we'd let you jump.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.686
Just let me see my mother.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.439
Fine, we'll take you
to our OR observation room.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.441
- I don't believe you!
- Your mother is fine.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.652
- I just spoke to her surgeon.
- I don't believe you!

21:18.778 --> 21:22.405
Hannah, what do you
want from us? What do you want us to do?

21:23.950 --> 21:24.991
I can't feel my legs.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.327
You're trying to pull
the same stunt twice in 10 minutes.

21:27.453 --> 21:31.957
I'm not pretending. They don't hurt.
They're just... They're...

21:48.099 --> 21:50.433
Anything?
We're not looking for pain.

21:50.559 --> 21:51.851
Anything at all? Pressure?

21:51.978 --> 21:53.103
Nothing.

21:53.229 --> 21:56.815
You have six broken bones, a fever,
a concussion, erratic heart rhythms

21:56.941 --> 21:59.442
and a complete lack
of sensation below the waist.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.653
I feel fine.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.281
Is my mother
out of surgery yet?

22:05.408 --> 22:06.783
Not yet.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.120
This is excellent.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.163
The paranoia seems
to have dissipated,

22:12.289 --> 22:14.290
but her vitals keep getting worse.
She could be dead in hours.

22:14.709 --> 22:17.919
But if you're gonna die a miserable,
lingering death,

22:18.045 --> 22:20.130
pain-free is the way to do it.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.132
Are we sure the fall
didn't cause the paralysis?

22:22.258 --> 22:26.636
The paralysis caused the fall.
Spine's clean. No vertebral fractures

22:26.762 --> 22:27.804
or spinal cord compression.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.723
Even better.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.810
The nuttiness and paralysis mean there's
definitely a neurological component.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.103
Could be a nerve disease.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.981
Which is why we need to look at
the nerve that you didn't biopsy.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.315
There are other tests.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.026
HIV? Syphilis?

22:42.403 --> 22:46.197
She was negative for all STDs.
Vascular? No, ANA was negative.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.324
Cerebral clot? No, MRI was...

22:48.451 --> 22:49.743
Thyroid storm.

22:52.663 --> 22:56.958
Makes sense given her glucose reaction
was slow, and potassium's down.

22:58.085 --> 23:02.380
Yeah, I'll check with
an endocrinologist.

23:02.506 --> 23:03.381
Bennett's on call.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.050
Perfect.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.690
- No.
- Need a consult.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.901
I already okayed
your nerve biopsy.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.360
Need an endocrinologist.

23:24.487 --> 23:25.445
Bennett's on call.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.696
Won't pick up.

23:26.822 --> 23:27.739
His cell phone must be broken.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.240
Mine's working.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.159
Had to give you the file.

23:34.121 --> 23:38.374
I assume you're thinking thyroid storm.
Have you done a hormone panel?

23:38.501 --> 23:41.086
Normal.
TSH was on the low side.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.340
Is that a cheery fire
I hear crackling nearby?

23:45.466 --> 23:48.093
No, what about CPK enzymes?

23:48.219 --> 23:50.011
Elevated, 275.

23:51.055 --> 23:55.642
People light fires for themselves,
but then they don't deny it.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.103
He's here?

23:58.229 --> 23:59.521
CPK isn't high enough.

23:59.647 --> 24:03.191
Potassium's what you'd expect
because of the bronchodilators.

24:03.317 --> 24:06.111
Oh, my God!
You're not wearing a bra.

24:06.237 --> 24:07.695
It's not thyroid storm.

24:07.822 --> 24:08.655
You just met him.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.198
I like him,

24:10.324 --> 24:13.201
and I like sex. Do I need to stitch
a letter on my tops?

24:13.619 --> 24:17.163
No. Might be worth taking out
an ad in the local papers.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.920
Do you like me, House?

24:25.339 --> 24:29.092
I was on the phone with Bennett 15
minutes ago. His cell phone's working.

24:29.218 --> 24:32.303
Your MO is to avoid me
at all costs,

24:32.429 --> 24:36.432
and suddenly you need my input on every
move you make. I can only assume

24:36.559 --> 24:37.517
it's because I'm on a date.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.018
When we met, I noticed...

24:39.145 --> 24:41.729
You noticed he was a Shriner
because of the way he parted his hair.

24:41.856 --> 24:44.274
You noticed he was a mama's boy because
of the way he blinked his left eye.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.442
I'm not interested.
I'm not impressed.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.863
There are only two reasons anyone would
want to screw with me tonight.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.865
Either they're an
altruistic decent person

24:51.991 --> 24:56.953
who's worried about my well-being,
or they want me for themselves.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.583
You left out the third option.

25:01.709 --> 25:05.044
Evil bastard who just wants
to mess with other people's happiness.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.968
Good night, House.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.023
We won't be bothered again.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.403
It's late. I should go.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.905
Why?

25:33.324 --> 25:35.867
I part my hair on the left,
and I'm a Shriner?

25:35.993 --> 25:37.869
You heard the conversation?

25:38.662 --> 25:39.871
I'm not interested in him.

25:40.414 --> 25:41.623
I don't blame you.

25:41.749 --> 25:45.001
I only said those things
so that he wouldn't come back.

25:48.297 --> 25:51.591
I don't really care
about my job. I do it well.

25:51.717 --> 25:55.094
I provide a service, but my goal
was always to make enough money

25:55.221 --> 25:59.724
to do the things I really like.
Music, travel...

25:59.850 --> 26:02.018
I like those things, too.

26:02.144 --> 26:05.230
You like them, but they're not
really important to you.

26:05.898 --> 26:10.902
I don't know whether it's House, your
job, or if you just thrive on conflict,

26:11.028 --> 26:14.989
but you should hear yourself
when you're talking to him.

26:16.951 --> 26:23.122
Nothing else in the world's going on.
You're focused, confident, compelling.

26:26.168 --> 26:32.131
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'd like to go out with that woman.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.761
I can get her on the phone.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.567
Where did you go?
She's getting worse.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.529
It's not thyroid storm.
Give me a spinal nerve.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.072
There are still other tests.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.657
She just said
the girl is getting worse.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.742
You really want to wait?

27:07.209 --> 27:09.460
We'll be risking infection,
maybe make the paralysis worse.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.964
It is worse, and we're making it worse
than worse? Do the biopsy.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.425
We could paralyze her
and get no useful information.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.968
Do the biopsy.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.261
If you're thinking
peripheral neuropathy,

27:18.387 --> 27:20.054
we should take a nerve a little further
away from the spine.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.849
A little further from the truth.
We're talking paralysis.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.101
There's a good chance
the spine is relevant.

27:25.227 --> 27:28.146
If this thing is progressing,
it could kill her in hours.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.524
Give me back my papers.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.859
Is he asking
for a spinal nerve?

27:34.570 --> 27:35.903
How did you know?

27:36.030 --> 27:37.071
Give us a minute.

27:43.537 --> 27:47.332
Did you know they recently found a
protein that speeds up nerve growth?

27:47.458 --> 27:50.084
Fascinating stuff.
If you put that protein

27:50.210 --> 27:52.045
with the insulation
from a spinal nerve,

27:52.171 --> 27:54.964
you could grow your own little garden.
If that spinal nerve...

27:55.090 --> 27:58.092
Yeah, yeah, yeah, if it happened to come
from a person with CIPA,

27:58.218 --> 28:02.347
I can grow pain-free nerves and graft
them into my own leg. What an evil plan!

28:02.639 --> 28:04.974
You'd have to be
on immunosuppressors for life.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.893
Risk of infection,
shorter lifespan...

28:07.019 --> 28:08.728
Shorter but normal.

28:09.855 --> 28:14.442
Usually jealousy expresses itself by
trying to destroy what someone has.

28:14.568 --> 28:18.196
You're more ambitious. You actually
want to change medical fact

28:18.322 --> 28:19.405
to get this thing...

28:19.531 --> 28:21.032
Medical fact
changes all the time.

28:21.158 --> 28:22.533
You're risking
your patient's life.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.369
That's how medical fact
changes.

28:24.495 --> 28:25.495
A doctor risks...

28:25.621 --> 28:29.040
To serve their
patient's health, not their own.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.208
This is medically justified.

28:30.334 --> 28:35.963
Are you sure? Are you sure that you're
the right one to be making this call?

28:47.393 --> 28:51.104
Biopsy whatever nerve you figure you
could safely get at.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.606
God, Wilson's annoying.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.070
Past 3:00 a.m.
on Valentine's Day night.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.073
I assume you had
a date with Wendy.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.117
She'll survive.
She knows the deal.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.119
- You're lucky.
- I know.

29:06.954 --> 29:10.790
Someday, when there's time, I would like
to actually have a social life.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.042
Someday? Come on.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.962
If there's one thing a good-looking
woman can have whenever she wants,

29:16.088 --> 29:17.088
it's a social life.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.923
You mean a sex life.

29:19.049 --> 29:20.925
There's nothing wrong
with a little companionship

29:21.051 --> 29:22.427
until the real thing
comes along.

29:22.553 --> 29:23.803
I had the real thing.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.222
Forgive me
if I don't want to settle.

29:26.348 --> 29:29.016
- Right.
- What does that mean?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.560
Nothing.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.645
You think I didn't have
the real thing?

29:32.771 --> 29:35.148
I have no idea what you had.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.649
And yet you're judging it.

29:39.069 --> 29:41.487
It's late. I'm cranky. Sorry.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.030
I didn't have the real thing.

29:43.157 --> 29:44.407
How could you even know?

29:44.533 --> 29:46.409
You married a dying man.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.705
You thought, "Six months, a year,
it'll be tough,

29:50.831 --> 29:53.040
"but then I'll recover,
and I'll have the rest of my life."

29:53.250 --> 29:57.253
It's like willingly getting the flu or
joining the Peace Corps, short-term.

29:57.379 --> 30:01.841
Wow, you nailed it. It's basically like
a wasted weekend.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.051
The sacrifices you made were huge,

30:04.678 --> 30:07.096
but they were at the height of your love
for him.

30:07.514 --> 30:11.517
Commitment is only commitment
because it has no expiration date.

30:11.643 --> 30:16.189
You stand next to someone and watch them
floss for 30 years like my parents have,

30:16.315 --> 30:19.817
then ask for sacrifices. That's how you
know the real thing.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.955
Cameron, I wasn't
criticizing you.

30:34.625 --> 30:39.086
People who avoid commitment are people
who know what a big thing it is.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.638
This isn't right.

30:53.227 --> 30:55.311
CIPA can't cause
this much degeneration.

30:55.437 --> 30:58.689
A few nerve fibers we teased out of the
center have some insulation left,

30:58.815 --> 31:01.400
but the insulation around the bundles
has been stripped bare.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.528
Means the damage must be coming
from the outside in.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.571
Which means it's secondary
demyelination,

31:05.697 --> 31:07.532
which means
the source is somewhere else,

31:07.658 --> 31:09.200
which tells us it's not
a nerve disease.

31:09.326 --> 31:12.537
It's something systemic
that's affecting the nerves,

31:12.663 --> 31:15.373
which means that we need to...

31:15.499 --> 31:17.166
Where are you going?

31:17.292 --> 31:19.085
Kid's mom is
finally out of surgery.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.838
I'll be right back.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.385
So what?

31:27.511 --> 31:28.970
Hannah should see her.

31:29.096 --> 31:33.182
Yes, immediately after we're done
chatting about saving her life.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.643
Most likely causes
are metabolic.

31:35.769 --> 31:38.646
They found brain swelling. They're
prepping her mother for another surgery.

31:38.772 --> 31:42.525
Again, so what?
Get a nurse to take the kid.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.152
There are more than 60 different
metabolic conditions

31:45.279 --> 31:47.738
that could account for what she's got.
There's only three of you guys.

31:47.864 --> 31:50.241
- She's scared.
- She should be.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.243
She'll die if
we don't diagnose her.

31:52.369 --> 31:53.953
So diagnose her.

32:05.132 --> 32:06.257
Mom?

32:25.444 --> 32:29.530
How bad is it? Are you okay?

32:30.574 --> 32:32.533
I'm okay, Mom.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.911
I'll get better.
I always get better.

32:36.038 --> 32:39.123
Are you checking yourself,
your temperature?

32:41.293 --> 32:46.213
Mom, could you just let it go?
You shouldn't be worrying.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.051
Baby, I'm sorry.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.720
I should have seen
that car coming.

32:52.929 --> 32:57.058
No, Mom, I did this
to myself. I screwed up.

32:58.477 --> 33:02.271
You were right. You were right,
and I was wrong.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.066
No. No.

33:05.192 --> 33:10.321
I shouldn't have gone out on the ice.
I shouldn't have fallen down,

33:12.115 --> 33:14.158
and I shouldn't have made you
rush me to an ER

33:14.284 --> 33:15.826
for the 10th time this year.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.668
Mom?

33:27.631 --> 33:29.674
- Mom?
- You okay?

33:30.550 --> 33:32.176
They have to take her
back to surgery.

33:32.302 --> 33:35.930
Hannah, your BP is way up.
We need to get you some rest.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.351
My hand's wet.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.062
You're crying.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.355
I can't cry.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.406
My head's killing me.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.542
So what does the pain tell us?

34:04.668 --> 34:06.377
No tingling or itching,
so we can rule out...

34:06.503 --> 34:09.380
It tells us nothing. It wasn't physical
pain. It was emotional.

34:09.506 --> 34:12.758
Exactly. What were they doing
when she got the headache?

34:12.884 --> 34:13.926
Saying goodbye.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.594
You said they were arguing.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.555
They weren't really arguing.
She was just frustrated.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.223
What were they arguing about?

34:19.349 --> 34:20.766
Whose fault it was.

34:22.561 --> 34:26.897
Peripheral neuropathy, fever
and intermittent paranoia.

34:27.023 --> 34:29.608
Lots of metabolic conditions
can explain those things.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.485
What if we add guilt?

34:32.696 --> 34:35.197
Guilt? As a symptom?

34:35.323 --> 34:38.492
Alzheimer's can
cause euphoria, pain causes depression,

34:38.618 --> 34:42.997
and B12 deficiency causes guilt,
along with all that other stuff.

34:43.123 --> 34:46.041
If she felt guilty, she wouldn't be
making her mother's life miserable.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.918
She wouldn't be getting
in fights, getting arrested.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.254
Maybe she's fighting
because she feels guilty.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.715
She's showing her mom she can take
stupid risks and still be safe.

34:52.841 --> 34:53.883
Means mom can let go.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.301
Which is rational.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.428
If guilt is a symptom,
it's caused by the illness,

34:57.554 --> 34:59.722
not by a thought process,
and it would have to be new.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.390
Couple years ago,
she was a model student.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.392
This is pointless.
If the headache was caused by guilt,

35:03.518 --> 35:04.769
she has a B12 deficiency.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.854
If it's just because
she was sad, it's meaningless.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.272
How the hell do we
test for that?

35:08.398 --> 35:09.523
We don't.

35:09.649 --> 35:13.611
Give her a shot of B12.
When she gets better, I was right.

35:13.737 --> 35:17.615
We already did.
ER gave her B12 when she was admitted,

35:17.741 --> 35:22.578
part of a multivitamin
supplement. Apparently, she's just sad.

35:28.335 --> 35:30.085
Why are you still here?

35:30.212 --> 35:33.631
Trying to get a couple pages into a drug
trial. Paperwork's due tomorrow.

35:33.757 --> 35:34.840
Why are you here?

35:34.966 --> 35:36.884
Still haven't figured out why.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.428
No, I meant here,
in my office.

35:39.554 --> 35:44.058
Just dumped a cool B12 theory.
Moved on to leukemia.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.894
Very pedestrian.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.562
I'm not happy.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.524
Her white-blood-cell
count was low.

35:51.650 --> 35:55.611
The ones she's got,
it's just a lot of eosinophils.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.822
The immunoglobulin
E-level's borderline.

35:57.948 --> 36:00.574
If you want to be 100% sure,
check the bone marrow.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.077
The team's doing
a biopsy right now.

36:05.497 --> 36:09.083
It turns out the
weird lawyer knew

36:09.209 --> 36:10.543
that she used to be a man.

36:10.669 --> 36:11.877
And he's cool with that?

36:12.003 --> 36:15.714
Turns out that his previous girlfriend
also used to be a man.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.385
Yeah.

36:24.224 --> 36:27.434
Is it possible for you
to just watch me eat,

36:28.603 --> 36:32.231
or do you get some primeval thrill out
of beating the other hunters

36:32.357 --> 36:33.691
to the food?

36:42.409 --> 36:43.784
See you later.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.162
You still haven't figured out
that I don't need sedation?

36:47.789 --> 36:50.666
It's so you don't move
during the procedure.

36:50.959 --> 36:54.670
Is that nitrous?
What, are you trying to kill her?

36:55.380 --> 36:57.715
We gave her nitrous
during the EEG.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.049
That's what made this thing
rear its ugly...

36:59.175 --> 37:00.426
What thing?

37:00.552 --> 37:01.760
B12 deficiency.

37:01.887 --> 37:02.761
Are you having déjà vu?

37:02.888 --> 37:05.973
We've had this conversation. She was
given B12. She didn't get better.

37:06.099 --> 37:09.727
Because someone else ate it.
Get an abdominal MRI.

37:09.853 --> 37:13.981
What? What are you doing?
Don't touch me!

37:14.190 --> 37:15.858
- Don't touch me!
- See? There's she goes.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.193
- Don't touch me!
- Another paranoid delusion.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.823
At the rate she's going downhill, forget
the MRI. We need an OR.

37:22.949 --> 37:23.991
Leave me alone!

37:25.744 --> 37:26.619
Occupied!

37:26.745 --> 37:27.912
Her hernia can wait.

37:28.038 --> 37:29.663
Help! They're trying
to kill me!

37:29.789 --> 37:33.208
Okay, you can either believe
that we really are trying to kill her,

37:33.335 --> 37:35.836
or you can assume she's suffering from
a medical condition.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.672
Seeing as this is a hospital,
and we're all dressed like doctors,

37:38.798 --> 37:40.591
and there are easier ways
to kill somebody...

37:40.717 --> 37:42.760
- Bev, help them.
- I'm gonna need iodine,

37:42.886 --> 37:46.847
scalpel numbers 10 and 15,
forceps and a largish salad bowl.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.267
Okay, hold her down.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.938
Come on, weenie,
she's in a cast.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.190
Swab.

37:59.819 --> 38:00.653
Fifteen.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.363
You're not gonna
anesthetize her?

38:02.822 --> 38:05.115
Relax.
It's just a magic trick.

38:09.579 --> 38:12.748
She's faking it.
We're not falling for it this time.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.710
Okay, keep that retracted.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.634
Forceps.

38:37.607 --> 38:42.653
Lake fishing can be fun. It can bring
the generations together.

38:42.779 --> 38:46.156
But if you don't cook
that trout or perch well,

38:46.449 --> 38:49.451
you'll be giving
room and board to this fellow,

38:50.120 --> 38:53.330
and by "free board,"
I mean all the B12 you can take in.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.582
I could have a tapeworm in me?

38:55.709 --> 38:58.085
Not likely.
You'd be in a lot of pain.

39:05.802 --> 39:07.344
It's gotta be 25 feet long.

39:07.470 --> 39:10.389
Damn it.
World record's over 60.

39:19.274 --> 39:23.694
Hannah, wake up.
Somebody here to see you.

39:25.822 --> 39:28.699
She's got limited motion
on her left side.

39:29.284 --> 39:32.119
You might have
to take care of her for a while.

39:35.832 --> 39:39.501
You don't feel it, but you're about to
rip your stitches out.

39:39.627 --> 39:42.755
Take care of yourself.
Then you can take care of her.

39:53.767 --> 39:55.392
You haven't gone home.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.644
Sorry I screwed up
Valentine's day.

39:57.771 --> 40:03.192
I'm dating a doctor.
I'd be an idiot to expect anything else.

40:03.318 --> 40:07.404
I did get you a gift. MGH.

40:08.782 --> 40:11.116
Best teaching hospital
in Boston.

40:11.242 --> 40:15.079
You want to be a nurse practitioner?
That's as good as it gets.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.291
I made a few calls,
and you're in if you want in.

40:19.542 --> 40:23.587
This is why you've been helping me get
my surgical hours for accreditation.

40:23.713 --> 40:25.798
- I thought you wanted...
- Stupid.

40:29.636 --> 40:32.179
You've got 10 feet of
personal space around you.

40:32.347 --> 40:34.640
I step forward, you step back.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.642
I've shared
a lot of things with you.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.685
Which is why
you're breaking up with me.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.773
You can't stand to be close.

40:42.899 --> 40:46.485
Wendy, you think I'll stay with you
because you're angry with me?

40:46.611 --> 40:48.403
I'm upset

40:49.906 --> 40:51.782
because I care.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.953
Only you'd expect
an argument to be rational,

40:57.622 --> 40:59.665
you and that
ass boss of yours.

41:23.565 --> 41:26.817
Well, you could ask her
for the spinal nerve.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.528
She's got no reason
to give it.

41:29.654 --> 41:30.654
She owes you.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.408
The hospital will
send her a bill.

41:35.368 --> 41:39.413
I'm just saying, if you want to do it,
do it while her B12 is still low.

41:40.582 --> 41:42.624
Guilt can be your friend.

41:47.714 --> 41:49.715
Breakfast?

41:50.425 --> 41:52.176
Yeah.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.557
Happy Valentine's Day.

41:58.683 --> 42:01.268
Holiday that only applies
to people who are already paired up.

42:01.394 --> 42:03.395
For everyone else,
it's Wednesday.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.607
Wow, thank you for
that dash of cold water.

42:06.733 --> 42:09.067
Don't get me wrong. I still think true
love's out there.

42:09.194 --> 42:12.654
It's just very far away,
possibly in another galaxy.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.740
We may need to develop
faster-than-light travel

42:14.866 --> 42:16.950
before we can make contact.

42:19.078 --> 42:21.705
So I'm thinking
we should have sex.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.417
That makes sense.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.627
Despite the wisdom
of pop songs,

42:26.753 --> 42:29.713
there's no point putting our lives
on hold until love comes along.

42:29.839 --> 42:34.801
We're both healthy and busy people.
We work together so it's convenient.

42:34.928 --> 42:36.220
Like microwave pizza.

42:36.471 --> 42:37.638
And of all the people
I work with,

42:37.764 --> 42:40.474
you're the one I'm least likely
to fall in love with.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.809
Like microwave pizza.

42:42.936 --> 42:46.688
The point here is to make things
simpler, not more complicated.

42:46.814 --> 42:49.274
Someday, there'll be time
to get serious about someone.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.819
Meanwhile, we already had sex once
and didn't get weird about it, so...

42:52.946 --> 42:58.325
I get it. I get it. So what if
I'm offended by your judgment?

42:59.953 --> 43:02.704
Then you're not the man
I'm looking for.
