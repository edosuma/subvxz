00:20.148 --> 00:23.278
Your record here
has been good, Dennis.

00:23.347 --> 00:26.314
- Shouldn't have any trouble.
- Let's hope, Mr. Azenauer.

00:26.387 --> 00:29.484
As you know, I'll be
your case officer.

00:29.553 --> 00:32.106
Here's the phone number where
you'll check in with me every week.

00:32.177 --> 00:34.085
- Understand that?
- Yes, sir.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.007
It'll help if you also look on me
as your friend, Dennis.

00:38.031 --> 00:40.201
I'll do my best, Mr. Azenauer.

00:40.270 --> 00:42.157
Psychologists say
you're a bright guy.

00:42.221 --> 00:44.130
Your best should be good enough.

00:44.205 --> 00:46.147
Now, you know
where you report for your job?

00:47.340 --> 00:49.674
Yes. It's typed very neatly, sir.

00:49.740 --> 00:52.292
Lowell Lumber and Supply.

00:53.962 --> 00:55.871
What do they know about me?

00:55.946 --> 00:57.833
The truth, Dennis.

00:57.897 --> 01:00.001
They know you got in a jam
when you were younger.

01:00.072 --> 01:03.039
You've been taken care of for a while,
and now you're okay again. Period.

01:03.112 --> 01:05.150
This isn't a prison.

01:05.223 --> 01:07.556
No one's gonna treat you
like you've been in one. Understand?

01:07.622 --> 01:09.825
Sounds good, sir.

01:09.894 --> 01:12.162
It'll be what you
make it, Dennis-

01:12.228 --> 01:14.562
You and no one else.

01:15.748 --> 01:18.082
Well, good luck.
Any questions?

01:18.147 --> 01:20.056
No, sir.

01:23.426 --> 01:26.392
Although, I must tell you,
Mr. Azenauer-

01:26.464 --> 01:29.758
A lumber yard does seem
like a slight waste of my talents.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.678
Is that so?

01:31.743 --> 01:33.597
Yes, sir.

01:33.662 --> 01:36.149
I've been taking a secret course
in interplanetary navigation.

01:36.221 --> 01:39.352
I had hoped to be appointed
to the first Venus rocket.

01:39.421 --> 01:42.965
- Cut that out, Dennis.
- I was kidding, sir.

01:48.058 --> 01:50.229
These fantasies of yours
can be dangerous.

01:50.298 --> 01:53.592
- Now you lay off that stuff.
- Yes, sir.

01:53.656 --> 01:56.754
Well, I better not miss
my bus to the lumber yard.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.852
You'll be hearing from me.

01:59.926 --> 02:01.813
Dennis.

02:03.349 --> 02:05.356
Believe me, Dennis,
you're going out...

02:05.429 --> 02:08.875
into a very real
and very tough world.

02:08.947 --> 02:12.394
It's got no place at all
for fantasies.

02:17.074 --> 02:19.659
Forward, ha!
Hup, two, hup.

04:35.336 --> 04:37.702
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

04:41.254 --> 04:44.155
- Morning, Mr. Bronson.
- Hello, Dennis.

04:50.947 --> 04:52.856
Mrs. Bronson?

05:00.225 --> 05:03.355
- Hi, Mrs. B.
- Good morning, Dennis.

05:03.423 --> 05:05.528
Uh, do me a favor, will ya?
Drop this off for processing?

05:05.599 --> 05:07.507
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

05:09.437 --> 05:12.120
<i>Oh, uh, better leave it in your own name,
if you won't mind.</i>

05:12.189 --> 05:14.043
- Why?
- Thanks, Mrs. Bronson.

05:14.108 --> 05:16.017
- Dennis, aren't you having any breakfast?
- That's okay.

05:16.091 --> 05:18.709
I had a couple of high-energy biscuits.
See ya!

06:58.621 --> 07:00.628
About time, Pitt.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.772
Yes. Yes, sir.

07:03.739 --> 07:05.648
Yes, sir.

08:47.740 --> 08:50.161
- All right, Pitt, what happened?
- I don't know, sir.

08:50.235 --> 08:53.202
- All of a sudden it just went crazy.
- "All of a sudden," huh?

08:53.275 --> 08:55.184
That's-That's certainly
how it seemed, sir.

08:55.257 --> 08:57.493
Of course, as I don't have to tell you,
I didn't actually see it...

08:57.561 --> 08:59.895
because I was concentrating
on my scope.

09:01.688 --> 09:03.629
L-Look here, Mr. Munsch,
you don't doubt me, do you?

09:03.703 --> 09:05.557
Oh, no, Pitt.
I don't doubt you.

09:05.622 --> 09:08.142
I just wish I could prove
what I don't doubt about you.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.799
I'd- I'd-

09:13.589 --> 09:15.443
"Lascivious carriage".

09:15.508 --> 09:17.362
That's an interesting phrase.

09:17.428 --> 09:21.899
- Never heard it.
- Says here troopers arrested a fella, 43...

09:21.970 --> 09:24.457
and a girl, 39...

09:24.529 --> 09:26.438
for lascivious carriage.

09:26.513 --> 09:28.454
Means they were doing
things to each other.

09:28.528 --> 09:30.829
Oh, boy. Let's see.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.656
Ah. Fall Road. It figures.

09:35.725 --> 09:38.692
- Why?
- You must be new in town, kiddo.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.244
- Fairly.
- Fall Road-

09:42.316 --> 09:44.170
That's back in the woods.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.373
You go down Lane to where
there's some, uh, birch trees.

09:46.442 --> 09:48.776
You arrive at make-out alley.

09:48.842 --> 09:51.711
Oh. In other words,
a well-known local meeting place.

09:51.784 --> 09:53.639
- Oh.
- Clandestine.

09:53.704 --> 09:55.558
<i>Clan who?</i>

09:59.110 --> 10:01.182
One of those troopers was a rookie.

10:01.254 --> 10:04.602
Imagine-A 25-year-old cop
arresting a 43-year-old man...

10:04.677 --> 10:07.164
for something he'd give his right arm
to be doing himself.

10:07.236 --> 10:09.723
<i>Yeah. I bet before
they made the pinch...</i>

10:09.796 --> 10:12.664
<i>they spent 20 minutes watching.</i>

10:16.737 --> 10:18.591
Hi.

10:19.968 --> 10:22.651
- Anyone got change for a quarter?
- Sure.

10:24.735 --> 10:28.116
Say-You aren't playing hooky
from school, are you?

10:28.190 --> 10:30.197
With the grades you need
for college these days...

10:30.269 --> 10:32.178
you must be insane.

10:33.148 --> 10:35.057
<i>Merci.</i>

11:02.132 --> 11:05.033
Don't say a word. Act perfectly natural.
We're under surveillance.

11:05.107 --> 11:07.016
Rendezvous tonight.
Bring this object.

11:07.090 --> 11:09.839
Spring Street Movie House, 8:00 p.m.,
seventh row, balcony, left side.

11:09.906 --> 11:12.458
Got that? Make your phone call.
Don't look after me.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.918
What?

12:01.793 --> 12:04.792
You've been
of greater service than you know.

12:04.865 --> 12:07.253
Thank you. Good-bye.

12:37.463 --> 12:39.535
I said good night, didn't I?

12:51.411 --> 12:53.799
- Oh!
- You're a reckless kid.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.590
Hey-What's this all about?

12:56.657 --> 12:58.566
- Who are you?
- My name is Dennis Pitt.

12:58.641 --> 13:02.284
- That's already more than you should know.
- What was in that bottle?

13:02.352 --> 13:05.101
Tetra acetic-
Satisfied?

13:18.474 --> 13:20.329
All right, all right.

13:20.394 --> 13:24.102
I suppose I owe you some
sort of explanation. It's wrong.

13:24.169 --> 13:26.536
It's against every rule in the book,
but I had to use you.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.087
- It was the only way out of that jam.
- What jam?

13:29.160 --> 13:31.777
Now that you're in this-

13:31.847 --> 13:34.235
God, it's so utterly crazy
it just might work.

13:34.310 --> 13:36.960
What might work?

13:38.757 --> 13:40.993
We can't talk here.
Get your car.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.296
Go on.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.218
Okay.

13:48.002 --> 13:50.685
- Your full name?
- Sue Ann Stepanek.

13:50.753 --> 13:53.785
- Is that Russian?
- Polish.

13:53.856 --> 13:55.765
Why aren't you writing this down?

13:55.840 --> 13:57.749
Memory is part of our
training program.

13:57.823 --> 14:00.440
- All right, Sue Ann, where do you live?
- 14 Fresh Air Lane.

14:00.510 --> 14:02.681
- Age?
- Eighteen.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.920
- College?
- Yes.

14:04.988 --> 14:06.843
I'm disappointed, Sue Ann.

14:06.908 --> 14:10.354
You were observed drilling with
a certain patriotic high school outfit.

14:10.427 --> 14:13.394
- Oh, that.
- I agree with you. It's juvenile.

14:13.467 --> 14:16.281
However, it led us to believe
that you were reliable and truthful.

14:16.346 --> 14:19.792
Well, I'm a senior at Chubb High.
Almost 18.

14:19.864 --> 14:21.871
That's better.
The truth never hurts.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.983
- Why did you lie to me?
- Well, I-

14:24.055 --> 14:27.731
- I didn't want to seem too young.
- Foolish child.

14:27.798 --> 14:31.507
If you read the papers, you'd know we have
used younger. What does your father do?

14:31.573 --> 14:34.703
Oh, he's dead- Killed in Korea.

14:34.772 --> 14:38.699
- That's rough. I'm sorry.
- Well, that's life.

14:38.771 --> 14:41.137
Wrong, Sue Ann. It is death.

14:41.202 --> 14:44.550
<i>We never confuse the two in my business.
Tell me about your mother now.</i>

14:44.625 --> 14:48.202
Ah, yes. Well, she's a typist
in a law firm.

14:48.272 --> 14:53.322
- Mm-hmm.
- But she's really kind of a problem, Dennis.

14:53.390 --> 14:55.561
- Good.
- What?

14:55.630 --> 14:57.963
The way you used my name-
It sounded quite natural.

14:58.029 --> 15:00.068
- We have an obvious rapport.
- Oh.

15:00.141 --> 15:02.050
- Now this problem with you mother-
- Oh, yeah.

15:02.123 --> 15:05.668
Well, she never lets me
go out or anything.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.626
Oh, I see.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.544
That sounds stupid, doesn't it?

15:09.609 --> 15:11.464
No, it's not uncommon in E.M. cases.

15:11.529 --> 15:14.277
"Employment of Minors". We have
techniques to get around that.

15:14.344 --> 15:16.514
No kidding.
What kind of-

15:16.583 --> 15:18.557
Techniques.

15:18.631 --> 15:20.965
Next right. Turn.

15:28.196 --> 15:30.787
Pull over there
and cut your headlights.

15:41.344 --> 15:43.678
You know, this is a funny place
for this kind of talk.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.873
- Why?
- The kids call this "Make-out valley".

15:46.942 --> 15:49.113
I know that.
That's why I chose it.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.036
It's a perfect cover-

15:51.101 --> 15:53.206
Like my routine job
at the Sausenfeld plant...

15:53.277 --> 15:56.276
- which covers my real mission here.
- Oh. What's that?

15:56.348 --> 15:58.486
Sorry. That's classified.

16:01.977 --> 16:05.904
Dennis, you know, there's something
I ought to tell you about my mother.

16:05.976 --> 16:08.245
I think she's mixed up with someone.

16:08.312 --> 16:11.660
<i>- A man?
- Well, sure. She's not queer.</i>

16:11.735 --> 16:15.214
But he- But he could be subversive.

16:17.205 --> 16:19.114
I think you watch
too much TV, Sue Ann.

16:19.189 --> 16:21.839
Well, couldn't you
check him out with those-

16:21.908 --> 16:23.947
You know, those techniques of yours?

16:24.019 --> 16:25.873
Okay.

16:25.939 --> 16:28.556
We'll check this character out
tomorrow night, if he's around.

16:28.626 --> 16:30.797
Oh, he'll be around.

16:32.305 --> 16:34.159
I'm glad I met you, Dennis.

16:34.224 --> 16:37.518
Be careful. Emotions can be
fatal in things like this.

16:37.584 --> 16:39.438
Well, in things like what?

16:39.503 --> 16:41.990
You know, you still haven't told me
what you're doing here.

16:47.181 --> 16:49.035
I can only tell you...

16:49.100 --> 16:51.042
that a certain alien group...

16:51.115 --> 16:53.832
plans to introduce
a diabolical substance...

16:53.899 --> 16:56.713
into the entire northeastern
water supply.

16:56.778 --> 17:00.388
They have chosen
the Sausenfeld Chemical Plant...

17:00.457 --> 17:02.595
as their infiltration point.

17:04.135 --> 17:06.175
If they-

17:06.246 --> 17:08.547
Someone's coming.
Pretend we're lovers.

17:08.614 --> 17:11.101
- Mmm! Mmm! Wait!
- Shh.

17:11.173 --> 17:14.555
Dennis, the gear shift.
Mmm, mmm.

17:21.506 --> 17:23.839
All right.
It's okay to get up now.

17:23.905 --> 17:26.271
Whenever someone's coming,
it's an old trick to do that.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.223
- I'll bet.
- No, I mean really.

17:28.288 --> 17:30.393
One agent escaped death
because of that.

17:30.464 --> 17:33.430
Well, I'll have to be going now.

17:33.502 --> 17:35.770
Yes. Myself as well.

17:39.197 --> 17:41.106
We may have been seen.

17:41.180 --> 17:43.667
Better I return to my place
cross-country.

17:43.739 --> 17:45.594
Wait five minutes
before you drive out.

17:45.659 --> 17:47.666
- Okay.
- Instructions-

17:47.738 --> 17:50.225
Our standard meeting place:
the hot dog stand, noon.

17:50.297 --> 17:52.718
If unable to comply:
Same, 24 hours later.

17:52.793 --> 17:55.509
- No phone contact. Got that?
- Hot dog stand, noon.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.021
Looks so innocent.

18:04.341 --> 18:06.479
What a damn deceptive world.

18:11.731 --> 18:14.349
Are you a secret agent?

18:17.329 --> 18:19.184
Good night...

18:19.249 --> 18:21.582
Sue Ann Stepanek.

18:31.821 --> 18:33.675
- Dennis?
- Mmm?

18:33.740 --> 18:36.609
- I dropped your film off for you.
- Thanks, Mrs. Bronson.

18:36.684 --> 18:38.593
There's another one
there on the bureau.

18:38.666 --> 18:41.349
You might-
You might ask them to rush that.

18:45.896 --> 18:48.710
Oh, uh, you got
a phone call this afternoon.

18:48.775 --> 18:53.247
- What?
- Some man asking if you stayed here.

18:53.318 --> 18:57.757
<i>- Who?
- Uh, it was some foreign-sounding name.</i>

18:57.829 --> 19:01.211
<i>- Azenauer?
- Yes, I think that was it.</i>

19:03.075 --> 19:04.984
Oh.

19:05.059 --> 19:06.913
What did you tell him?

19:06.978 --> 19:10.239
Why, I told him you were at work.
What would I tell him?

19:14.208 --> 19:17.371
It's a bad game.
They never warn you there's no way out.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.722
I hope they burn him.

19:25.885 --> 19:28.372
Why? The accused person
could be innocent-

19:28.444 --> 19:30.680
What we term a victim
of circumstance.

19:30.747 --> 19:34.291
Are you kiddin'? He murdered
the broad, then he stole her car.

19:34.362 --> 19:37.809
Her girlfriend saw him go.
It says so.

19:37.881 --> 19:40.531
Of course it says so,
but study the girlfriend.

19:41.656 --> 19:44.175
<i>- What about her?
- She looks too innocent.</i>

19:44.247 --> 19:46.613
Could be a case of entrapment.

19:47.798 --> 19:50.001
- Hello. Haven't we met?
- I think we did somewhere.

19:50.070 --> 19:52.458
Oh, too bad. I'd love to chat,
but I have no time.

19:52.533 --> 19:54.441
<i>So long.</i>

20:21.004 --> 20:23.523
- Hi.
- Hi. Where's the kid?

20:23.595 --> 20:27.336
- Movies.
- Thank God for the movies.

20:27.402 --> 20:29.573
I've got some bourbon.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.610
Your mother's quite a handsome woman.

20:36.679 --> 20:39.395
I thought the idea
was to check out him.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.723
I tell you frankly, Sue Ann...

20:46.788 --> 20:50.049
this man does not visit your mother
for any subversive reasons.

20:50.115 --> 20:52.984
But how do you know
till you check him out?

20:54.914 --> 20:57.084
Okay. We'll get his picture.

20:57.154 --> 20:59.641
- It has to be a profile, though.
- Profile? Why?

20:59.712 --> 21:01.719
To show the ears.
They never change.

21:01.792 --> 21:04.028
Many a man has been unmasked
because of his ears...

21:04.095 --> 21:06.199
even after extensive plastic surgery.

21:06.270 --> 21:09.019
Well, I didn't know that.

21:09.085 --> 21:10.972
Luckily for us, not many people do.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.891
All right, instructions:

21:12.957 --> 21:14.866
Dash under cover to the car
and start the engine.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.795
- I'll be there right after the explosion.
- Explosion?

21:16.860 --> 21:18.714
You ask too many questions, Sue Ann.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.048
It's a habit you're
gonna have to break.

22:00.910 --> 22:02.851
Hey! Hey! Who is that? Hey!

22:04.525 --> 22:07.175
Photo will be checked tomorrow.
It was a stupid risk.

22:07.244 --> 22:09.415
- Move out.
- Okay.

22:11.978 --> 22:15.490
<i>It spreads
from the factory waste pipes...</i>

22:15.561 --> 22:18.528
<i>into the lakes,
into the reservoirs-</i>

22:18.601 --> 22:20.672
<i>Silent. Deadly.</i>

22:22.439 --> 22:25.602
You're crazy. It's just a stupid lake.

22:25.670 --> 22:28.866
I mean, don't agents
ever do anything exciting?

22:28.934 --> 22:30.908
You poor kid.

22:32.421 --> 22:35.322
It's that old
post-operational let-down.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.817
I'll give you something to fix that.

22:39.235 --> 22:41.689
- Are they drugs?
- They're not addictive.

22:41.762 --> 22:44.347
They're government issue.
They're called A.C.T.'s. Go ahead, take one.

22:44.417 --> 22:46.805
Are they like sniffing glue?

22:51.071 --> 22:54.844
Oh, boy. Sometimes you seem
very, very young, Sue Ann.

22:57.149 --> 22:59.483
Maybe you won't make a P.A.C.-N.S.

22:59.549 --> 23:01.490
What's a P.A.C.-N.S.?

23:01.564 --> 23:04.629
I'll explain that term
after you take a couple.

23:04.699 --> 23:06.608
Well, you take it first.

23:07.642 --> 23:09.551
Okay.

23:15.415 --> 23:17.270
Okay.

23:22.997 --> 23:26.062
Mmm.

23:26.132 --> 23:28.204
How long is it gonna take?

23:28.276 --> 23:30.796
Not long.
You'll know.

23:32.242 --> 23:34.925
I wonder what my mother
and that man are doing now.

23:34.994 --> 23:37.165
You know, when he came out,
he was barefoot.

23:37.233 --> 23:39.883
- I have no idea.
- I bet they were getting ready.

23:39.953 --> 23:42.057
Uh, Sue Ann, P.A.C.-N.S...

23:42.128 --> 23:45.739
stands for "Plausible Agentry
Contact, Non-Salaried".

23:45.807 --> 23:49.635
- You could qualify. - You know, when
grown-ups do it, it's kind of dirty.

23:49.709 --> 23:52.359
That's 'cause there's
no one to punish them.

23:52.429 --> 23:56.225
Uh, Sue Ann, I'll check all this
with my cutout from Springfield.

23:56.299 --> 23:58.754
He'll be coming here to Winslow soon.
His name is Azenauer.

23:58.827 --> 24:02.503
Don't be surprised if he
orders a change in my status.

24:04.297 --> 24:06.184
Sue Ann, all this is very important.

24:06.248 --> 24:08.615
Are you listening?

24:13.158 --> 24:15.613
The moon is acting very funny.

24:28.994 --> 24:30.848
Sue Ann.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.421
Sue Ann.

24:41.086 --> 24:42.995
Shazam.

24:48.251 --> 24:50.106
Mmm.

24:51.131 --> 24:53.137
Oh, I feel good, Dennis.

24:54.298 --> 24:57.461
I feel ripe.
Getting ready to bust.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.727
Winslow contacts you,
what shall I do?

25:03.799 --> 25:05.970
- What should you do?
- Uh-huh.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.241
Well, uh, what do you think?

25:08.309 --> 25:11.243
- I don't think.
- Well-

25:11.317 --> 25:14.000
Guess.

25:14.068 --> 25:15.922
Make out?

25:17.811 --> 25:19.665
More.

25:19.730 --> 25:21.617
Sleep together?

25:21.682 --> 25:23.591
No sleeping.

25:46.346 --> 25:48.451
Yeah, help me.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.119
- Sue Ann.
- Mmm.

26:20.608 --> 26:22.517
That was good.

26:23.871 --> 26:26.204
Yeah.

26:26.270 --> 26:29.303
Hey, Dennis, when do we
do something exciting?

26:32.508 --> 26:34.515
Soon.

26:34.588 --> 26:37.402
The pressures are closing in.

26:37.467 --> 26:39.800
I feel them everywhere.

26:41.306 --> 26:43.215
Don't you?

26:49.943 --> 26:51.852
I feel empty.

27:07.826 --> 27:10.029
Pitt. Wake up.

27:13.072 --> 27:15.919
There's a guy here to see you.
Name is Azenauer.

27:15.984 --> 27:19.496
<i>Morton Azenauer.
Mean anything to you?</i>

27:19.567 --> 27:24.300
Mmm. Probably some hack gumshoe
from the Bureau of Licenses.

27:24.365 --> 27:26.536
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

27:26.604 --> 27:30.694
I once did some
unlicensed tree surgery.

27:30.763 --> 27:34.307
I foolishly performed
an abortion on a peach tree.

27:34.378 --> 27:37.160
Get movin', wise guy.
You're on company time.

27:52.676 --> 27:55.392
- Hello. We meet again.
- Hello, Dennis.

27:57.156 --> 27:59.162
I'd like a last cigarette.

27:59.234 --> 28:01.405
I decline a blindfold.

28:01.474 --> 28:04.920
- You haven't changed much, Dennis.
- Who does?

28:04.992 --> 28:08.439
- I had a hell of a time finding you.
- Good.

28:08.512 --> 28:12.220
Come on. Let's walk around
somewhere we can talk.

28:14.462 --> 28:16.534
That's where the chemical waste
is discharged.

28:16.606 --> 28:18.842
- Oh, yeah?
- Over 70 million gallons a year.

28:18.909 --> 28:20.915
I've traced all the stream patterns.

28:20.988 --> 28:25.013
By next spring there may not be an
"unmonstrous" fish as far south as New York.

28:25.083 --> 28:27.221
Aw, it's a necessary evil.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.395
Yeah, I've heard that.

28:29.465 --> 28:32.279
Dennis, I'm here to talk about you.

28:32.345 --> 28:34.351
You broke your probation.

28:34.424 --> 28:36.431
It's over a year
you didn't check in.

28:36.504 --> 28:39.569
Well, I'm trying to be...
self-reliant, Mr. Azenauer.

28:39.639 --> 28:41.645
You're accountable to the state.

28:41.717 --> 28:44.946
You knew you weren't to change
address without permission.

28:45.013 --> 28:46.867
What are you gonna do?

28:46.932 --> 28:50.346
Drag me back to the barred
windows and the witch doctors?

28:50.419 --> 28:52.753
I guess I should, Dennis.

28:52.819 --> 28:56.134
Only it might not be
such a cozy place this time.

29:00.176 --> 29:02.728
I'm not going back, Mr. Azenauer.

29:05.614 --> 29:07.719
Believe me, I'm not.

29:15.148 --> 29:17.384
Mr. Azenauer...

29:17.451 --> 29:19.938
would you think it possible
if I told you...

29:20.010 --> 29:22.497
I'm in love?

29:22.570 --> 29:25.286
It's possible.

29:29.927 --> 29:32.098
Well, I am, Mr. Azenauer.

29:32.167 --> 29:34.501
I have the love
of a clean, true girl.

29:34.566 --> 29:37.053
She needs me.
I lend meaning to her life.

29:37.125 --> 29:39.612
In case you doubt
her character, I'll add...

29:39.685 --> 29:42.717
that she carries the state flag
for the Chubb High School drill team.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.553
You have a bad way
of gilding the lily, Dennis.

29:47.618 --> 29:51.392
Just when I wanna
believe you, I'm afraid.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.464
You're afraid I'll run away?

29:53.537 --> 29:55.675
I'll blow up cities? I'll rape and burn
and destroy property...

29:55.744 --> 29:57.653
- and get arrested for lascivious carriage?
- Now look-

29:57.727 --> 30:00.148
You're afraid that I can take care
of myself and don't need your services.

30:00.222 --> 30:02.131
You're afraid that in spite of you,
in spite of your doctors...

30:02.206 --> 30:04.474
- I'll rehabilitate myself.
- Dennis, for God's sakes.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.744
I've got 50 more cases
than I know what to do with.

30:06.813 --> 30:08.917
- Good. Then leave me alone.
- These are laws. Laws must be abided.

30:08.988 --> 30:10.897
Give me two weeks-
Two weeks to keep my nose clean, okay?

30:10.971 --> 30:12.825
- Dennis!
- We're talking about my life, Mr. Azenauer.

30:12.890 --> 30:15.507
We're talking about
my one and only life.

30:24.215 --> 30:26.069
Okay, Dennis.

30:26.134 --> 30:28.239
It's my neck if I'm wrong,
but I won't take you in...

30:28.310 --> 30:30.219
on condition
that you hold your job-

30:30.293 --> 30:32.529
that you phone in to me
every single day, you understand?

30:32.596 --> 30:34.505
- Yes.
- You can mail me your payroll stubs too...

30:34.580 --> 30:36.489
- just to be sure.
- Good idea. Thanks.

30:36.564 --> 30:39.432
Aw, don't thank me.
I'm probably being a fool.

30:43.153 --> 30:45.062
So long for now, Dennis.

30:46.096 --> 30:48.910
Mr. Azenauer?

30:48.976 --> 30:50.884
Really, thanks.

30:51.855 --> 30:53.742
Okay.

30:57.069 --> 31:00.298
- You're through, Pitt.
- What do you mean?

31:00.365 --> 31:03.233
You finish Friday and then
find yourself another job. And lots of luck.

31:03.307 --> 31:06.503
- You mean I'm fired?
- That's a good word for it.

31:06.571 --> 31:08.991
A chemical plant is no place
for a convicted arsonist...

31:09.065 --> 31:11.934
<i>and you're even lucky
I'm letting you finish out the week.</i>

31:12.009 --> 31:14.147
Well, I don't understand.

31:15.656 --> 31:18.097
Why did he tell you that?
I was 15 years old when that happened.

31:18.224 --> 31:19.882
So what? I'm meant to cry?

31:28.110 --> 31:30.979
Thanks, old buddy,
for getting me fired.

31:31.052 --> 31:33.954
What are you talking about?
Why were you fired?

31:34.028 --> 31:35.883
Why do you think?

31:35.948 --> 31:37.889
Because of what you told
your pal Munsch.

31:37.963 --> 31:40.548
Good Lord. He promised me
he wouldn't fire you.

31:40.618 --> 31:43.617
- I guess it was a necessary evil, huh?
- That's rotten.

31:43.689 --> 31:46.143
- What's his number? I'll call him back.
- No need, sir.

31:46.216 --> 31:48.321
I'm right this moment applying
for a better position elsewhere.

31:48.391 --> 31:50.246
My chances are excellent.

31:50.311 --> 31:52.318
I'm glad to hear that.
Have 'em call me.

31:52.390 --> 31:54.277
Uh, where are you applying?

31:54.341 --> 31:56.828
It's called Silver Mills.
Here in Winslow.

31:56.901 --> 31:59.039
Dennis, be honest
with 'em, won't you?

31:59.108 --> 32:01.180
I mean, tell 'em about your record.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.935
You may not believe it,
but it's always much the best way.

32:04.003 --> 32:05.857
You've been fired?

32:05.922 --> 32:08.605
Sue Ann, if you'll remember, I told you
there might be a change of status.

32:08.674 --> 32:11.007
- It's part of the plan.
- But why were you fired?

32:11.073 --> 32:13.439
Happens often.
Agents are deliberately discredited...

32:13.504 --> 32:15.391
to help them carry out
their missions.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.658
This sounds fishy to me, Dennis.
Like that man-

32:17.726 --> 32:21.370
He looked like he was
giving you a chewing.

32:21.438 --> 32:23.347
Okay.

32:28.283 --> 32:30.192
See this?

32:31.643 --> 32:33.649
Yeah. That's your work card.

32:33.722 --> 32:36.242
Yes, among other things it is.

32:36.313 --> 32:38.222
Now read it...

32:38.296 --> 32:40.205
through this.

32:43.575 --> 32:46.128
"Pitt. C.I.A., 3704-"

32:47.894 --> 32:50.991
- The C.I.A.? Oh, God!
- Ruthless devils.

32:51.060 --> 32:53.296
- They don't care who they use.
- What do you mean?

32:53.364 --> 32:55.819
It's not their fault.
They didn't make this world either.

32:55.892 --> 32:57.898
I mean, you've been
approved, Sue Ann.

32:57.971 --> 33:00.142
My orders have come through-
Raid Sausenfeld.

33:00.210 --> 33:03.373
And since it's too late to send in
a new man now, you and me are the team.

33:03.441 --> 33:06.091
- Oh, wow! Brief me.
- Where'll you be at 5:00?

33:06.161 --> 33:08.015
- Uh, drill practice.
- I'll pick you up right after.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.934
I'll need your help
to contact Azenauer.

33:13.518 --> 33:15.656
- Hello.
- "Good afternoon.

33:15.725 --> 33:18.539
"This is Miss Stepanek,
Mr. Barge's secretary...

33:18.604 --> 33:21.735
- at Silver Mills in Winslow".
- Yes, Miss Stepanek?

33:21.804 --> 33:25.512
"I'm calling you in connection
with our hiring Mr. Dennis Pitt.

33:25.578 --> 33:27.487
Oh, yes.
He mentioned that.

33:27.562 --> 33:31.173
"Yes, my supervisor
asked me to call you, Mr. Azenauer.

33:31.241 --> 33:33.280
His name is Barges".

33:33.352 --> 33:35.904
"Mr. Pitt told us
that he was on probation...

33:35.975 --> 33:39.586
"and we would like a letter
to the effect...

33:39.654 --> 33:41.824
- "that Mr. Pitt-
- Is or isn't trustworthy.

33:41.893 --> 33:45.024
"is or isn't trustworthy.

33:45.093 --> 33:48.703
Frankly, his frankness
impressed us quite a lot".

33:48.772 --> 33:51.673
Okay, I'll send that.
What's the address?

33:51.747 --> 33:54.113
- What's the address?
- 14 Fresh Air Lane, Winslow.

33:54.178 --> 33:57.177
- 14 Fresh Air Lane, Winslow.
- "Mr. Barges...

33:57.249 --> 33:59.419
- That's my address.
- 14 Fresh Air Lane, Winslow".

33:59.488 --> 34:01.659
- Never mind. Hang up.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

34:01.727 --> 34:04.214
He's sending it
to Mr. Barges at my address.

34:04.287 --> 34:06.174
Of course. You're my drop.
We'll intercept it.

34:06.238 --> 34:08.147
Briefing at 8:00 p.m.
tonight, my place.

34:08.222 --> 34:10.130
Trailer in front of Bronson's Garage.
Approach from the rear.

34:10.205 --> 34:12.440
- Don't let yourself be seen.
- Oh, wow. This is really exciting.

34:12.507 --> 34:14.612
More than you know, Sue Ann.
When he said he'd send the letter-

34:14.684 --> 34:16.625
That was the code signal
I've been waiting for.

34:16.699 --> 34:18.608
It means we make our raid tonight.

34:18.683 --> 34:21.878
Oh, wow!
Your place tonight.

34:43.059 --> 34:44.913
A phone call for you, Dennis.

34:44.978 --> 34:46.833
Some girl.

34:48.594 --> 34:50.862
Hi. It's me.

34:50.928 --> 34:52.967
I can't get out tonight.

34:53.041 --> 34:55.179
What do you-What do you mean,
you can't get out?

34:55.248 --> 34:59.883
I'm a prisoner, Dennis.
The old hag even took my car keys.

34:59.950 --> 35:03.015
But, Sue Ann, tonight-

35:03.085 --> 35:05.125
Well, you know
what there is tonight.

35:05.197 --> 35:08.294
I told you Mom was a problem.
Now maybe you'll believe me.

35:08.363 --> 35:11.679
Oh, well, this isn't happening.
I must be dreaming this.

35:13.482 --> 35:16.830
Didn't you say you had techniques
for dealing with hang-ups like this?

35:16.905 --> 35:18.814
Yes-Yes, I have techniques.

35:18.889 --> 35:21.605
I'm just no longer sure you're
worth using them on, Sue Ann.

35:23.239 --> 35:25.792
Well, I'm sad
you feel that way, Dennis.

35:25.863 --> 35:28.415
See, I remember at the lake.

35:29.445 --> 35:31.550
Yeah.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.419
She might be listening in.
I better go now.

35:35.491 --> 35:37.596
Dream of me, huh?

36:02.619 --> 36:05.401
Some agent.
You were really scared.

36:08.794 --> 36:11.095
Dennis, I wouldn't
blame you a bit...

36:11.161 --> 36:14.455
if you were just furious
about last night.

36:14.519 --> 36:17.747
I would as soon forget
about last night.

36:17.815 --> 36:19.669
I got through to my people.

36:19.734 --> 36:22.122
Operation's rescheduled
for tonight, same timetable.

36:22.197 --> 36:24.368
- See ya, Pete.
- Dennis.

36:25.332 --> 36:27.186
Listen.

36:27.252 --> 36:31.528
- Before we go out again, you have
to meet my mother. - What?

36:31.602 --> 36:33.838
- Yes.
- What do you think we're planning here?

36:33.906 --> 36:35.848
- Some kind of a Girl Scout outing?
- Dennis, you've got to.

36:35.922 --> 36:38.125
It's the only way. Now listen.
I worked it all out peachy.

36:38.193 --> 36:40.167
I told her that you were related...

36:40.240 --> 36:43.021
to one of her very best friends.

36:44.111 --> 36:46.696
<i>It's a good likeness, isn't it?</i>

36:52.237 --> 36:54.146
Of Margaret St. Ange.

36:54.219 --> 36:56.291
Sue Ann did say she was your aunt,
didn't she?

36:56.363 --> 36:59.657
Oh! Well, well, well.

37:00.650 --> 37:02.504
<i>She sure did,
but, uh-</i>

37:02.569 --> 37:06.823
But, uh, pardon me for preferring
to look at you, Mrs. Stepanek.

37:06.888 --> 37:09.092
Oh, my.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.614
<i>My.</i>

37:12.774 --> 37:15.010
I thought chivalry was dead.

37:15.078 --> 37:16.900
I don't know about that,
but it's surely plain...

37:16.965 --> 37:18.819
where Sue Ann gets her good looks.

37:18.884 --> 37:20.858
Oh, stop.

37:20.932 --> 37:22.819
We're very different, actually.

37:22.883 --> 37:25.021
Except that Sue Ann is stubborn...

37:25.090 --> 37:27.130
<i>but of course she knows
that I'm even more stubborn.</i>

37:27.202 --> 37:29.144
Oh, boy.
Fasten your seat belts.

37:29.218 --> 37:31.192
<i>- Don't whine, Sue Ann.
- Mother.</i>

37:31.265 --> 37:35.126
Oh, Sue Ann, I'm sure Mr. Pitt doesn't
like to see you acting like a brat.

37:35.199 --> 37:37.981
Uh, if we're gonna get
to the movies on time, I guess-

37:38.047 --> 37:39.934
<i>Your parents live
in Winslow, Dennis?</i>

37:39.998 --> 37:42.779
No, my folks died in a car crash
when I was two.

37:42.845 --> 37:45.016
Oh. How terrible.

37:45.084 --> 37:47.418
Yes. Uh, of course,
I don't remember it much.

37:48.923 --> 37:50.995
Strange that Margaret
never mentioned that tragedy.

37:52.026 --> 37:53.968
Oh-

37:54.042 --> 37:56.910
Uh, act-Actually, the St. Anges...

37:56.985 --> 37:59.734
are close friends of my aunt.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.094
They used to...
live together.

38:06.998 --> 38:09.965
You didn't tell me
quite right, did you?

38:10.037 --> 38:12.305
Well, what's the difference?

38:12.372 --> 38:14.543
In Holyoke, wasn't it?

38:14.612 --> 38:16.521
No, ma'am.
That was in Westfield-

38:16.595 --> 38:18.450
where they worked.

38:18.515 --> 38:21.002
- Really?
- What's the difference?

38:21.074 --> 38:23.244
Who cares about
all that family crud?

38:23.313 --> 38:24.714
Oh, that's too bad.

38:25.241 --> 38:28.877
- Mr. Pitt is gonna have to go to
the movies by himself. - What?

38:29.481 --> 38:32.717
I told the child the next time she used
an unladylike word like that...

38:32.782 --> 38:34.789
she'd have to go
right upstairs to bed.

38:34.862 --> 38:39.268
- Mother.
- Mr. Pitt is a grown man, dear. He understands.

38:39.340 --> 38:41.641
Excuse me. I'm gonna get
a glass of water in the kitchen.

38:41.707 --> 38:44.456
Ah, you see?
You've embarrassed Mr. Pitt.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.278
Dennis, have I embarrassed you?

38:46.347 --> 38:48.834
- No, I'm thirsty, that's all.
- Well, let's go then.

38:48.905 --> 38:51.076
- You go to your room.
- Make me.

38:54.343 --> 38:56.514
<i>Let's go, Dennis.</i>

38:59.142 --> 39:01.825
I really am very sorry.

39:01.894 --> 39:03.966
I said, let's go, Dennis.

39:05.541 --> 39:08.507
"Mr. Pitt's a grown man, dear.
He understands".

39:08.579 --> 39:11.644
Oh, what crud-
Playing you against me like that.

39:11.714 --> 39:13.568
Yeah.

39:13.634 --> 39:17.146
"Sue Ann, get away.
Play with kids your own age".

39:17.216 --> 39:19.125
Oh, boy.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.883
- What an old bag she is.
- Sue Ann, Sue Ann.

39:21.952 --> 39:23.991
Unwind yourself.

39:24.063 --> 39:27.924
Our mission needs ice-cold nerves.

40:27.948 --> 40:31.110
- Do you know how to use a wrench?
- Sure.

40:31.179 --> 40:33.633
The chute is sectioned
right above us.

40:33.706 --> 40:37.447
Our objective is to loosen the superstructure
supporting section number two.

40:37.513 --> 40:39.487
If we do it right,
the whole works will come down...

40:39.560 --> 40:41.632
on the first load they pipe through
in the morning.

40:41.704 --> 40:43.907
You take the bottom section.
I'll do the top.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.884
Counter-sabotage, huh?

40:45.959 --> 40:49.886
Remember, we're striking a blow
for every decent citizen in this area.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.152
Let's go.

41:54.257 --> 41:56.395
All right, come down.

41:57.425 --> 42:00.937
<i>You heard me, son.
Start climbin'.</i>

42:01.008 --> 42:03.658
And don't try anything.

42:03.727 --> 42:05.668
I got a gun-

42:23.113 --> 42:25.022
I hit him twice.

42:25.097 --> 42:26.983
You see, he started to go down...

42:27.048 --> 42:29.796
and then I bopped him
on the side of the head.

42:31.143 --> 42:33.793
Oh, he sure is bleeding, isn't he?

42:33.862 --> 42:35.770
Yeah.

42:38.820 --> 42:42.594
The C.I.A. does cover
this kind of stuff, doesn't it?

42:43.619 --> 42:45.506
Hmm?

42:46.498 --> 42:48.385
Uh-

42:48.450 --> 42:50.718
- Well?
- Yeah. S-S-Sometimes.

42:50.784 --> 42:52.693
Well-

42:52.768 --> 42:55.255
What should we do?

42:56.287 --> 42:58.141
You're sweating.

42:58.206 --> 43:00.060
You're cool.

43:00.126 --> 43:02.580
What should we do, Dennis?

43:02.653 --> 43:05.107
Well, that-

43:05.180 --> 43:07.067
That depends.

43:08.892 --> 43:10.866
You mean on how he is?

43:10.938 --> 43:13.393
Yeah.

43:13.466 --> 43:17.239
Just...
let me think a minute.

43:17.305 --> 43:20.271
- Does he know you?
- Yeah.

43:22.583 --> 43:24.590
His name is Sam.

43:25.686 --> 43:28.402
I bet with him on a...

43:28.469 --> 43:30.541
baseball game once.

43:34.484 --> 43:36.370
Duck!

44:27.844 --> 44:30.429
He was dead, Dennis.

44:30.499 --> 44:32.440
The chute's right over him, you see?

44:32.514 --> 44:34.423
<i>When it falls down in the morning...</i>

44:34.498 --> 44:37.344
<i>they'll figure that's
what killed him.</i>

44:49.214 --> 44:51.068
God, what a night.

44:51.133 --> 44:53.750
Let's get out of here, huh?

45:04.729 --> 45:07.663
- Let's make out.
- Sue Ann.

45:07.736 --> 45:09.645
- Sue Ann.
- Mmm. Let's make out.

45:09.719 --> 45:12.915
- Wait a second.
- Dennis- Make love to me.

45:12.982 --> 45:14.891
- No-
- Mmm.

45:14.966 --> 45:16.820
Sue Ann, listen.

45:16.885 --> 45:20.603
What's the matter?
Do you need a pill?

45:20.731 --> 45:23.185
Sue Ann-

45:27.449 --> 45:29.903
Okay, buster.
What's your name?

45:29.976 --> 45:32.147
Dennis Pitt.

45:32.216 --> 45:34.997
What was he trying to make
you do, honey? Something bad?

45:35.063 --> 45:37.910
Uh, no.
We were just kidding around.

45:37.974 --> 45:40.624
<i>Look,you don't have
to cover for him.</i>

45:40.693 --> 45:44.652
<i>- How old are you?
- Twenty-one.</i>

45:44.723 --> 45:47.886
Yeah? Let's see your license.

45:47.954 --> 45:50.856
- What kind of a country is this?
Can't two people sit- - Shut up.

45:50.930 --> 45:54.225
When somebody asks you,
that's when you talk.

45:54.289 --> 45:57.484
- Twenty-one, huh?
- You know there's a curfew around here.

45:59.248 --> 46:01.996
Haul tail, buster.
You ride with us.

46:02.062 --> 46:04.363
You lead the way home, honey.

46:29.446 --> 46:31.301
<i>...area of Main Street.</i>

46:31.366 --> 46:34.016
<i>609, accident, east side of town.</i>

46:38.436 --> 46:41.501
Well, I guess they were
just having a good time, Officer.

46:41.571 --> 46:45.344
I mean, they weren't, uh,
actually doing anything, were they?

46:45.410 --> 46:49.402
No, nothing you could
actually call "doing anything".

46:49.473 --> 46:53.083
Well, all's well that ends well,
I always say.

46:54.207 --> 46:56.573
I can't thank you enough, Officers.

46:58.365 --> 47:00.503
Good night, Mrs. Stepanek.

47:03.900 --> 47:06.550
You're one lucky kid, buster.

47:06.619 --> 47:10.196
If I were you, I'd get down on my knees
to this woman.

47:15.257 --> 47:17.427
You were going to the movies, huh?

47:17.496 --> 47:19.830
You dumb little slut.

47:19.895 --> 47:22.382
And as for you-
I talked to Margaret's parents.

47:22.455 --> 47:25.520
They never even heard of you.
Those lucky people.

47:25.589 --> 47:28.109
<i>Well?</i>

47:28.181 --> 47:30.089
What's the matter?

47:30.164 --> 47:32.552
Don't you have any
nice lies all ready?

47:32.627 --> 47:35.310
I'm sorry, ma'am.

47:35.379 --> 47:38.509
You know why I sent
those cops away, don't you?

47:39.537 --> 47:41.991
Sure. It was for Sue Ann's sake.

47:43.984 --> 47:47.911
You are so right,
Mr. Dennis Trash Pitt.

47:47.983 --> 47:49.837
<i>People stink.</i>

47:49.902 --> 47:52.618
<i>I have you copped, the whole town says,
"There's smoke, there's fire. "</i>

47:52.685 --> 47:55.913
<i>Sue Ann must have led you on.
Well, maybe she did. I don't give a damn.</i>

47:55.981 --> 47:58.631
But I'm gonna tell you something,
and I want you to get this straight.

47:58.700 --> 48:00.608
You so much as look
at my girl in the street again...

48:00.683 --> 48:02.886
and I'm gonna have you
put in jail without a key.

48:02.955 --> 48:04.841
<i>I work for
a very respected lawyer...</i>

48:04.906 --> 48:07.044
<i>and he'll take care of you.</i>

48:07.113 --> 48:09.763
I'm not bulling.
Now get out.

48:11.880 --> 48:14.879
If I could just speak
to Sue Ann for one minute.

48:14.950 --> 48:17.186
I said get out.

48:19.493 --> 48:22.242
Good night, Sue Ann.

48:27.555 --> 48:29.921
Why, you tramp!

49:19.188 --> 49:21.642
Funny. Sam hasn't clocked out yet.

49:21.714 --> 49:24.266
Better take a look for him.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.447
The exterior chute collapsed.
Damn thing fell on Sam Joyles.

51:26.519 --> 51:28.428
Killed him.

51:29.398 --> 51:31.634
Yes, sir.

51:31.701 --> 51:33.904
<i>Yes sir, will do.</i>

51:33.972 --> 51:36.906
Toot the whistle.
Boss says shut down.

51:36.980 --> 51:39.761
Yeah, this is Sausenfeld.
Gimme the police.

51:47.217 --> 51:51.077
<i>Bronson's Garage. Yes, he's here.</i>

51:52.239 --> 51:54.759
<i>Well, I'd be glad to, Mr.--</i>

51:54.830 --> 51:56.902
<i>Munsch.</i>

51:56.974 --> 51:59.493
<i>Good-bye.</i>

52:04.139 --> 52:07.968
Uh, Mr. Munsch over at the factory
would like to see you.

52:10.762 --> 52:13.859
<i>Dennis, he said he'd
like to see you right away.</i>

52:17.896 --> 52:20.197
What's the matter, Pitt? You so rich
you can afford to walk out...

52:20.263 --> 52:22.204
without pickin' up
your final paycheck?

52:26.117 --> 52:28.288
- Thanks.
- Pitt!

52:29.412 --> 52:31.932
Funny about that chute collapsing.

52:32.003 --> 52:33.890
It was inspected only last month.

52:35.075 --> 52:37.245
<i>Meinhardt said it'd be
good for another 50 years.</i>

52:37.313 --> 52:40.924
It was also funny about Sam Joyles
being right underneath it.

52:43.552 --> 52:46.551
I'm afraid I can't share your sense
of humor, Mr. Munsch.

52:47.551 --> 52:49.655
<i>- So long.
- Uh, Pitt.</i>

52:49.726 --> 52:52.376
<i>By the way, uh,
one other little thing.</i>

52:52.445 --> 52:55.793
These gents want to talk to ya.

52:55.868 --> 52:58.039
They're detectives.

53:00.635 --> 53:02.838
Mr. Munsch tells us
you're on probation, Pitt.

53:02.906 --> 53:04.913
I believe the offense was arson.

53:06.681 --> 53:09.298
- That's right.
- What did they do to you?

53:10.936 --> 53:13.750
Well, this was, uh, some time ago.

53:13.815 --> 53:16.781
I was confined for a while.

53:16.853 --> 53:20.049
They said I was a-
A disturbed juvenile.

53:20.117 --> 53:22.985
<i>They said?
You mean you weren't?</i>

53:23.060 --> 53:24.969
I didn't think so, sir.

53:25.043 --> 53:27.311
Beg pardon?
Say that again.

53:27.378 --> 53:30.509
- He says he thought he was normal.
- Oh.

53:30.578 --> 53:34.254
<i>Mr. Munsch says that you often say
things that he doesn't understand.</i>

53:35.441 --> 53:37.349
That's entirely possible, sir.

53:38.895 --> 53:41.545
You seem like a smart guy, Pitt.
What's your theory about the gun?

53:43.885 --> 53:46.186
- What gun?
- The watchman's gun.

53:46.252 --> 53:48.161
You see, it hasn't been found.

53:48.236 --> 53:51.432
Okay, what is this? What are
you trying to get me to say?

53:51.500 --> 53:53.354
Aren't you meant to tell me
I can call a lawyer?

53:53.419 --> 53:55.840
Gosh, Pitt!
We're not accusing you of anything.

53:55.914 --> 53:58.815
<i>You know any reason we should
accuse you of anything?</i>

54:01.224 --> 54:03.133
When's the autopsy on Joyles?

54:03.208 --> 54:05.989
- I figure tomorrow.
- You know, it could be very interesting.

54:06.055 --> 54:08.607
Water in the lungs and all that.

54:08.678 --> 54:12.157
But keep in touch, Pitt.
That'll be all for now.

54:13.605 --> 54:15.514
Good luck, Pitt.

55:58.917 --> 56:00.956
Sue Ann, are you crazy?
First rule of the C.I.A.:

56:01.028 --> 56:03.548
"Unless directed otherwise, never revisit
the scene of the sabotage".

56:03.620 --> 56:05.212
- Oh, Mickey Mouse.
- What?

56:05.283 --> 56:08.032
- That's Mickey Mouse!
- Sue Ann, this whole area reeks with cops.

56:08.098 --> 56:10.650
Dennis, why are they dragging
the edge of the river?

56:10.721 --> 56:13.949
- Must be for his gun. The old guy lost it.
- Oh!

56:14.016 --> 56:18.041
Sue Ann, put those glasses down.
They reflect the light.

56:18.111 --> 56:21.045
Dennis, listen.
We had a bad break.

56:21.118 --> 56:24.117
That letter came for Mr. Barges,
and the old hag opened it up...

56:24.190 --> 56:27.091
- and called Azenauer.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

56:27.165 --> 56:29.303
- So that's what he's doing up here.
- Yeah. They came and got me...

56:29.372 --> 56:31.859
out of class- asked me
all kinds of stupid questions-

56:31.931 --> 56:34.069
but don't worry,
I didn't tell 'em anything.

56:34.139 --> 56:36.342
Don't worry, huh?
They'll take me back for sure, now.

56:36.410 --> 56:38.264
They'll lock me up.
I'll never get out.

56:38.329 --> 56:42.005
- Your own C.I.A. contacts?
- Sue Ann, you don't understand.

56:42.072 --> 56:44.755
He's still gotta do
his job. W-W-We all do.

56:44.823 --> 56:48.532
He's-He's got to act as a probation
officer, and do what the law says he must.

56:48.598 --> 56:51.597
Anything to do with the C.I.A. is gratuitous.
He'd have to pretend he never heard of it.

56:51.670 --> 56:53.938
- Oh.
- He's gotta do his job, Sue Ann.

56:54.004 --> 56:56.622
That's even one of the reasons
he picked me, because-

56:56.692 --> 56:59.505
I'm an N.P.R.:
"Non-Possible Returnee".

56:59.571 --> 57:02.123
I've got a record.

57:02.194 --> 57:05.575
<i>- All the things in the letter were true?
- What? What? What?</i>

57:05.649 --> 57:09.576
What? Setting fire to your aunt's house,
and burning her up alive?

57:10.895 --> 57:13.928
- Is that true?
- Sue Ann, wait a second.

57:13.999 --> 57:16.845
I didn't know she was in that house.
I swear I didn't.

57:18.030 --> 57:20.134
See, I'd been playing
with some girl next door.

57:20.205 --> 57:23.019
Playing doctor or something.
Her name was Ursula.

57:23.084 --> 57:26.018
And my aunt caught us.

57:26.091 --> 57:28.905
It wasn't bad! It wasn't bad!

57:30.090 --> 57:33.122
And my aunt beat me
with a pile of sticks.

57:33.193 --> 57:37.283
So I took that pile of sticks into the cellar,
and I set fire to them, Sue Ann.

57:37.351 --> 57:40.067
But I thought my aunt was out.

57:40.135 --> 57:43.995
That poor fool. She sneaked back into
the house, after she told me she was going out.

57:44.069 --> 57:46.851
I guess she hoped to catch me committing
lascivious carriage or something, but...

57:46.917 --> 57:48.771
I didn't know it, Sue Ann-
I didn't know she was in the house.

57:48.836 --> 57:50.778
You see, it's-You see-

57:50.852 --> 57:53.469
Crazy. You're all sweaty,
when you were the one...

57:53.539 --> 57:55.807
with the experience
in killing people.

57:55.874 --> 57:58.721
Oh, God. Sue Ann,
you say such crazy things.

57:58.785 --> 58:01.305
- Maybe that's why I love ya.
- Cross your heart?

58:01.377 --> 58:03.929
Cross your heart!

58:04.000 --> 58:05.941
Boy.

58:07.614 --> 58:09.818
What a week.

58:11.070 --> 58:13.174
I met you on Monday.

58:13.245 --> 58:16.211
Fell in love with you on Tuesday.

58:16.283 --> 58:19.631
Wednesday, I was unfaithful.

58:19.707 --> 58:22.740
Thursday, we killed a guy together.

58:24.185 --> 58:27.251
How about that for
a crazy week, Sue Ann?

58:30.552 --> 58:33.420
"Unfaithful Wednesday"?

58:33.495 --> 58:36.112
I was just jokin', Sue Ann.

58:36.182 --> 58:38.549
That was in another country.
Forget it.

58:39.733 --> 58:42.666
I do, no kidding, love you.
I love you.

59:02.318 --> 59:04.903
Why don't we get married, Dennis?

59:08.588 --> 59:10.759
Yeah!

59:11.947 --> 59:14.401
Yeah. Why don't we?

59:14.474 --> 59:16.448
We could be
a husband-and-wife team...

59:16.522 --> 59:19.336
sent all over the world
on special missions.

59:19.401 --> 59:22.018
Take a rocket. Go to the moon, maybe.

59:22.088 --> 59:25.349
Think of making love on a rocket.
I mean, weightless and everything.

59:25.415 --> 59:27.487
What a make out.

59:28.838 --> 59:31.554
Hey, no kidding.
Why don't we?

59:31.621 --> 59:34.173
Because, Sue Ann, by tonight,
Azenauer's gonna have me in jail...

59:34.244 --> 59:38.683
- for busting my probation.
- Oh, not if we run.

59:38.755 --> 59:40.991
Run where?

59:44.033 --> 59:46.204
I love you.

59:46.273 --> 59:48.127
I never made it with
anyone before you, Dennis.

59:48.192 --> 59:51.061
Sue Ann, sweetheart, running away now
is like admitting we killed that watchman.

59:51.136 --> 59:53.743
Yes, but they'll never find us.
I know they won't. They can't catch us!

59:53.843 --> 59:55.548
They'll be watching for me.
Roadblocks everywhere.

59:55.614 --> 59:57.882
Well, that's today.
Not tomorrow.

59:57.950 --> 01:00:00.731
- W-What do you mean?
- Look, you hide out
in the woods till tomorrow...

01:00:00.796 --> 01:00:03.610
and they'll figure that you've already
given them the slip.

01:00:03.675 --> 01:00:06.130
Right?

01:00:07.707 --> 01:00:10.008
You-You're quite
a planner, Agent Stepanek.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:13.618
I'll get the money tonight, and then-
Then we'll drive, Dennis.

01:00:13.688 --> 01:00:16.175
We'll drive all the way
to the Bay of Mexico.

01:00:16.247 --> 01:00:20.240
Oh, Sue Ann. Why didn't
I meet you earlier in my stupid life?

01:00:20.311 --> 01:00:22.961
Oh, who cares?
It's happening now.

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:26.738
It happens every time
you touch me, Dennis.

01:00:26.804 --> 01:00:29.105
- Do you love me? Don't you want me always?
- Yes.

01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.639
- Oh, Sue Ann.
- Mm!

01:00:35.187 --> 01:00:37.325
It'll look funny
if I'm back late from lunch.

01:00:37.394 --> 01:00:39.303
<i>You see, I'm on the honor roll.</i>

01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:02.736
- You'll be okay?
- Yes.

01:01:02.836 --> 01:01:05.058
If you let anyone catch you,
I'll just kill you, Dennis.

01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:08.260
- No, no. I won't.
- I'll pick you up at exactly 10:00 tomorrow.

01:01:08.328 --> 01:01:10.782
- Okay.
- Dennis, kiss.

01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:15.394
God, how I love you, Sue Ann.

01:01:17.766 --> 01:01:20.034
Mm. My Hygiene class.

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.955
Oh.

01:01:25.155 --> 01:01:27.227
- Sue Ann?
- Yeah?

01:01:28.706 --> 01:01:32.480
We-We won't wear bathing suits
in the Bay of Mexico?

01:01:32.545 --> 01:01:35.032
<i>What a nut.
Hasta luego, nut.</i>

01:03:32.701 --> 01:03:34.740
Peepin' Tom, huh?

01:04:39.464 --> 01:04:42.780
Hey!

01:04:42.856 --> 01:04:44.960
Going someplace?

01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:48.064
You're lucky I'm early.
Where were you going?

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.883
Nowhere.

01:04:50.949 --> 01:04:53.250
What happened to your face?

01:04:54.436 --> 01:04:57.338
You are some character, Dennis.

01:04:57.411 --> 01:04:59.964
I'm surprised the C.I.A.
lets you out without a keeper.

01:05:00.035 --> 01:05:01.943
Come on. Get in.

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:05.271
Dennis, get in!

01:05:25.372 --> 01:05:27.258
Hmm. Now.

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:29.624
I wonder which looks best.
What do you think?

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:32.853
Sue Ann, will you hurry up with that suitcase?
You've spent 20 minutes on it already!

01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:36.913
<i>I want to look nice when we check into a motel.</i>

01:05:39.063 --> 01:05:40.918
Oh, no.
No, that's Mom!

01:05:40.983 --> 01:05:43.303
<i>- What is she doing here?
- What?</i>

01:05:45.639 --> 01:05:49.282
- You said she was gone for the weekend.
- I thought she was too.

01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:52.447
She must have snuck back
like that aunt of yours did.

01:05:52.517 --> 01:05:54.818
What are we gonna do?

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:58.112
Well, I've been thinking about this,
and I've decided...

01:05:58.178 --> 01:06:00.087
the best way
for everyone-

01:06:00.162 --> 01:06:02.878
you know, for you and me...

01:06:02.945 --> 01:06:06.043
for the C.I.A.,
for Mr. Azenauer-

01:06:08.095 --> 01:06:10.964
For all of us.

01:06:23.643 --> 01:06:27.024
<i>It's the night watchman's.</i>

01:06:27.098 --> 01:06:30.577
I took it just in case.

01:06:30.649 --> 01:06:33.965
Hey, so what's the sweat?

01:06:34.039 --> 01:06:36.275
Why, it's not such
a big deal for somebody...

01:06:36.343 --> 01:06:40.172
who's already burned up
his own aunt.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.766
<i>Sue Ann?
Are you still asleep up there?</i>

01:06:42.837 --> 01:06:45.935
Quick- Oh, Mother,
uh, uh, what time is it?

01:06:46.005 --> 01:06:48.492
- Is it, uh, late?
- You want some breakfast?

01:06:48.563 --> 01:06:51.530
Um, yes, how about, uh, pancakes?

01:06:51.603 --> 01:06:55.147
Okay, dearie.
It's your figure.

01:06:58.352 --> 01:07:01.068
Dennis, wake up!
It's the only way, don't you see?

01:07:01.136 --> 01:07:03.950
You've got to!

01:07:04.015 --> 01:07:08.356
Do you want to be locked up by that
nasty old Mr. Azenauer again?

01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:11.015
- No.
- No.

01:07:11.085 --> 01:07:13.124
So shoot her.

01:07:16.779 --> 01:07:20.127
They'll never find her.
We'll dump her in the lake.

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:23.943
And then we'll be a million miles away,
in the Bay of Mexico.

01:07:30.855 --> 01:07:32.894
She'll be in the kitchen
with her back turned.

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:34.908
It's a potshot.

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.354
- Who's that?
- Well, I don't know.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:43.386
Some sailor from
New London or somewhere.

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:45.563
Did he- Did he make out
with you, Sue Ann?

01:07:45.634 --> 01:07:49.016
I don't re- I don't remember. Maybe.

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:53.147
- You said you never did it with anyone but me.
- Well, what's the difference?

01:07:53.216 --> 01:07:55.125
Dennis, she's coming up the stairs!

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.109
<i>Come on!</i>

01:09:31.715 --> 01:09:35.456
Dennis, you know,
she wasn't frightened at all?

01:09:35.522 --> 01:09:37.560
She just looked a little surprised.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.974
I feel like we're married now,
don't you, Dennis?

01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:44.468
Like really married?

01:09:50.493 --> 01:09:52.826
Dennis?

01:09:54.044 --> 01:09:56.661
What do people do
as soon as they're married?

01:09:58.203 --> 01:10:00.341
Hmm?

01:10:02.138 --> 01:10:05.398
- Mm.
- Oh. I don't think I can.

01:10:10.199 --> 01:10:12.915
All right. Let's
get rid of her, then.

01:10:24.018 --> 01:10:26.538
Now.

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:28.780
Get my car and back it around
to the kitchen door.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:32.427
<i>Okay.</i>

01:10:44.045 --> 01:10:45.899
Mrs. Stepanek's residence.

01:10:45.964 --> 01:10:48.746
Sue Ann?
This is Morton Azenauer.

01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:50.851
You met me at school with your mother
yesterday. Remember?

01:10:50.923 --> 01:10:54.021
Oh-Oh, yes, Mr. Azenauer.

01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:58.496
<i>Now, listen, Sue Ann.
For your sake as well as his...</i>

01:10:58.568 --> 01:11:03.749
- where's Dennis Pitt? - I don't-
I don't have any idea. Really.

01:11:03.815 --> 01:11:05.855
I ju- Listen, I can't talk now.

01:11:05.926 --> 01:11:08.609
Well, let me speak to your mother.

01:11:08.677 --> 01:11:11.262
She's gone for the day, I'm afraid.

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:13.754
Well, where is she?

01:11:13.827 --> 01:11:16.958
Listen, I-I can't talk now.
I've got something on the stove...

01:11:17.027 --> 01:11:18.936
and, uh- I just can't talk now.

01:11:19.011 --> 01:11:21.912
I'm leaving Bronson's
for the police station.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:25.879
- Now, if you hear from Pitt-
- Mr. Azenauer, I cannot talk now.

01:11:25.952 --> 01:11:27.893
Get it straight, Miss Stepanek.

01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:30.519
If you're covering
for that bad apple...

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:33.175
you're in one hell of a jam.

01:12:02.261 --> 01:12:05.489
Okay. The coast is clear.
Give me a hand.

01:12:18.704 --> 01:12:20.908
Easy.

01:12:27.246 --> 01:12:29.547
- Why didn't you open the trunk?
- Wait.

01:12:37.899 --> 01:12:40.134
- No, wait. No, okay.
- No!

01:12:41.769 --> 01:12:43.841
Well, isn't that stupid!

01:12:48.039 --> 01:12:50.111
No, no, no, no.

01:12:51.495 --> 01:12:54.909
<i>- What's that?
- You should know.</i>

01:12:57.445 --> 01:13:01.022
Looks like-
It looks like chemical from the factory.

01:13:01.092 --> 01:13:04.506
Don't you remember?

01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:06.717
I don't.
It looks familiar, though.

01:13:06.786 --> 01:13:10.167
Dennis Pitt, you really are a case.

01:13:12.896 --> 01:13:14.750
Now, instructions.

01:13:14.815 --> 01:13:18.938
Throw the gun in deep, and then
wire up Mom with lots of rocks.

01:13:19.006 --> 01:13:21.045
- Uh-huh.
- The wire's back here.

01:13:21.117 --> 01:13:23.004
Now, throw her in,
drive back here...

01:13:23.069 --> 01:13:27.192
and I'll get all the blood cleaned up,
and then we can take off, okay?

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:30.107
- For the Bay of Mexico?
- Of course!

01:13:30.171 --> 01:13:32.243
Where else, silly?
Hurry up, now.

01:13:36.761 --> 01:13:41.429
Sue Ann, what would happen
if I... wasn't really a C.I.A. agent?

01:13:41.496 --> 01:13:44.756
What do you mean, what would happen?

01:13:44.823 --> 01:13:47.342
Would you stop loving me?

01:13:47.414 --> 01:13:51.090
Dennis, I'm hung up on you. I'll love you
forever no matter what happens.

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:58.510
I've noticed you do have
quite a capacity for loving.

01:15:29.335 --> 01:15:31.189
Police Department.

01:15:31.255 --> 01:15:34.123
Uh, can I speak to the chief?

01:15:34.198 --> 01:15:36.718
- Is this an emergency?
- Yup.

01:15:36.789 --> 01:15:38.828
Just one moment.

01:15:40.692 --> 01:15:42.633
Frank Hill here.

01:15:42.707 --> 01:15:45.673
- Are you the chief of police?
- Yeah.

01:15:45.746 --> 01:15:48.134
What do you want?

01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:52.550
I... want-
I want to report a murder.

01:15:52.624 --> 01:15:55.307
Okay.

01:15:55.375 --> 01:15:59.749
- What do you mean, "Okay"?
- Go ahead. What's the story?

01:15:59.822 --> 01:16:02.374
- About the murder?
- Yeah.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:07.115
Well, my name is Dennis Pitt.

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.187
And I'm at Kozak's gas station.

01:16:11.594 --> 01:16:14.179
- You know where that is?
- Yeah.

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:17.631
Are you the murderer?

01:16:17.704 --> 01:16:21.413
- Uh-huh.
- Who'd ya murder?

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.967
- Mrs. Stepanek.
- Uh-huh.

01:16:25.126 --> 01:16:27.809
Where's the body?

01:16:27.878 --> 01:16:29.819
In the trunk.

01:16:29.893 --> 01:16:32.674
What are your plans?

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.773
- My plans?
- That's right.

01:16:36.835 --> 01:16:39.104
My God, you're certainly
gabby, mister.

01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:41.722
Hill. Frank Hill.

01:16:41.793 --> 01:16:44.989
- Aren't you gonna arrest me?
- Keep talkin', son.

01:16:45.057 --> 01:16:47.063
We got plenty of time.

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:49.754
-Just tell me all about it.
- Well--

01:16:54.494 --> 01:16:56.882
- Come out of there, with your hands up.
- How did you get here so fast?

01:16:56.957 --> 01:16:59.061
Come out of here.
Come on, move! Move!

01:17:03.866 --> 01:17:05.775
You're under arrest, punk.
Let's go.

01:17:16.919 --> 01:17:18.828
Bastard!

01:17:18.903 --> 01:17:22.862
Rotten, dirty, crazy
murdering bastard!

01:17:22.997 --> 01:17:25.582
I couldn't talk to you
over the phone...

01:17:25.652 --> 01:17:28.139
because he had a pistol at my head.

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:35.018
He'd already killed
your poor mother?

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.883
Right in front of my eyes.

01:17:39.952 --> 01:17:42.056
It was horrible! It was horrible!

01:17:42.127 --> 01:17:44.134
<i>Easy, honey.</i>

01:17:44.207 --> 01:17:46.694
You don't have to talk about it now.

01:17:46.766 --> 01:17:49.099
Lay off the kid.
Lay off her, huh?

01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:50.954
I still can't figure
why he killed the old watchman.

01:17:51.081 --> 01:17:54.658
To get the gun, obviously. He'd planned
on killing Mrs. Stepanek from the beginning.

01:17:58.727 --> 01:18:01.825
Oh, I was such a fool, Mr. Azenauer.

01:18:01.894 --> 01:18:05.537
I let him go on even after
I knew he was crazy.

01:18:05.605 --> 01:18:08.190
<i>I- I just- I-</i>

01:18:23.296 --> 01:18:25.303
I'm sorry, Sue Ann.

01:18:25.375 --> 01:18:29.749
I believed him when
he told me he loved me.

01:18:29.822 --> 01:18:32.276
It's almost as if-

01:18:32.349 --> 01:18:35.795
I feel a little bit responsible
for Mom's death myself.

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:40.058
<i>But Mom saw through him.</i>

01:18:40.122 --> 01:18:42.838
<i>Oh, she tried to warn me too.</i>

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:47.794
I- I guess that's why he figured
he had to get rid of her.

01:18:52.279 --> 01:18:54.188
Please, can't you
take him somewhere?

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:56.783
I can't bear him
looking at me like that.

01:18:56.854 --> 01:18:58.762
Come on.

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:04.016
Sue Ann! I love you!

01:19:04.084 --> 01:19:05.992
Don't you know I love you?

01:19:06.067 --> 01:19:08.717
<i>I did love you.!</i>

01:19:19.567 --> 01:19:21.422
Here's your Pepsi, sweetheart.

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:26.659
You're all so good to me. Thanks.

01:19:36.393 --> 01:19:39.240
Look, Dennis.

01:19:39.305 --> 01:19:42.087
I've spent months on this.

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:44.061
Now, at last, they're willing...

01:19:44.135 --> 01:19:46.142
to give you a lie detector test,
and you won't take it-

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:49.891
- Why not?
- Mickey Mouse.

01:19:49.958 --> 01:19:52.543
You like it here, huh?

01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:54.522
You look forward to spending
the rest of your life here?

01:19:54.596 --> 01:19:56.505
Well, I've been in worse places.

01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:59.481
There are good, strong bars
to keep out the riffraff.

01:19:59.555 --> 01:20:01.976
You're a liar, Dennis.
A liar and a fool.

01:20:02.051 --> 01:20:03.992
But I simply do not
believe you're a killer.

01:20:04.066 --> 01:20:07.131
That's your problem, old pal.

01:20:07.201 --> 01:20:09.656
As you said to me
the first day we met...

01:20:09.728 --> 01:20:12.727
"The world has no place
at all for... fantasies".

01:20:15.038 --> 01:20:18.714
There's some reason behind it. You got
some crazy reason no one understands.

01:20:20.188 --> 01:20:22.097
Maybe.

01:20:24.379 --> 01:20:26.233
What?

01:20:26.299 --> 01:20:29.232
Come on, Dennis.
Tell me.

01:20:29.306 --> 01:20:31.826
Don't you see
I'm the only friend you have?

01:20:37.367 --> 01:20:40.662
There was some poison once.

01:20:40.727 --> 01:20:43.214
But no one recognized it.

01:20:43.286 --> 01:20:46.634
In fact, that poison
was even quite pretty-looking.

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:49.937
So the problem was,
what to do about it?

01:20:50.963 --> 01:20:52.818
It took me some time
to realize that...

01:20:52.883 --> 01:20:55.784
what to do about it was very simple.

01:20:55.858 --> 01:20:57.767
Nothing.

01:20:59.026 --> 01:21:01.480
- Nothing?
- Correct, Mr. Azenauer.

01:21:01.553 --> 01:21:04.334
Because who'd listen to me-
known to be no good?

01:21:04.399 --> 01:21:06.668
But if that poison
just stayed there...

01:21:06.735 --> 01:21:09.451
getting worse and worse,
like poison always does...

01:21:09.518 --> 01:21:12.681
spreading, until even
the blindest man could see...

01:21:12.749 --> 01:21:15.945
<i>- until he had to see-
- Go on.</i>

01:21:19.819 --> 01:21:22.022
Sorry.

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.945
I've learned that...

01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:26.824
people only pay attention to what
they discover for themselves.

01:21:31.144 --> 01:21:33.053
So long.

01:21:34.918 --> 01:21:37.503
If you're ever in Winslow...

01:21:37.573 --> 01:21:39.645
see what Sue Ann is up to, will ya?

01:21:47.747 --> 01:21:49.982
I'll keep an eye on her, Dennis.

01:21:52.001 --> 01:21:54.586
So long.

01:22:32.309 --> 01:22:35.026
Uh, pass the sugar, please?

01:22:35.093 --> 01:22:37.263
Oh, sure.

01:22:38.484 --> 01:22:41.450
- You live around here?
- Uh-huh.

01:22:41.522 --> 01:22:44.369
- With your folks, I guess, huh?
- No,just people.

01:22:47.505 --> 01:22:51.595
The pop died, and then last year,
my mom was murdered.

01:22:52.559 --> 01:22:55.079
Oh, good Lord.

01:22:55.151 --> 01:22:58.084
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:23:00.333 --> 01:23:02.950
Sure was rough
for a while, but-

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.874
Yeah, life has to go on, I guess.

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:07.110
Yeah.
Did they get the guy?

01:23:07.178 --> 01:23:10.079
Oh, sure. Psychopaths
always get caught.

01:23:10.154 --> 01:23:12.641
- They never know when to stop.
- He's a nut, huh?

01:23:12.713 --> 01:23:15.560
- Complete!
- Wow.

01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:18.689
Now, why do they let types like that
walk around loose, anyway?

01:23:20.262 --> 01:23:22.847
But you know, they're hard to tell.

01:23:22.918 --> 01:23:26.627
Some of'em act just
as normal as you and me.

01:23:26.693 --> 01:23:29.507
And then, all of a sudden-

01:23:31.747 --> 01:23:34.463
This one also killed
a watchman over at Sausenfeld.

01:23:34.531 --> 01:23:36.799
- He worked there for a while.
- You're kidding!

01:23:36.866 --> 01:23:39.516
That's where I work!

01:23:39.585 --> 01:23:41.951
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:45.311
- I bet you're new in Winslow, too.
- That's right. Yeah.

01:23:45.375 --> 01:23:47.316
- New and footloose.
- Yeah.

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:50.738
- How'd you know?
- Well, if I'd seen you before, I-

01:23:50.814 --> 01:23:54.010
Well, I'm sure I'd have remembered
if I'd seen you before, that's all.

01:23:57.787 --> 01:24:00.307
My name's HarryJackson.

01:24:00.379 --> 01:24:04.022
- Sue Ann.
- How about a movie tonight, Sue Ann?

01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:07.024
- Oh, I can't.
- Oh, come on!

01:24:07.097 --> 01:24:09.463
I'm not dangerous.

01:24:09.528 --> 01:24:12.015
No! It's these people
I live with, Harry.

01:24:12.087 --> 01:24:13.974
They're just-
They're so awful and square.

01:24:14.039 --> 01:24:16.013
They won't let me
go out or anything.

01:24:16.086 --> 01:24:18.387
Maybe we can figure a way
to pull the wool over them.

01:24:20.532 --> 01:24:24.012
That's interesting.
Maybe we could, you and me.

01:24:24.084 --> 01:24:27.149
What's that old saying?
"Where there's a will, there's a way".

01:24:27.219 --> 01:24:29.585
- That's the saying.
- How 'bout it?

01:24:32.785 --> 01:24:34.759
Well-

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.127
I can't promise you anything, Harry.

01:24:40.847 --> 01:24:42.853
But you could be very helpful to me.

01:24:45.006 --> 01:24:47.558
I'll walk you over the bridge
and we'll talk about it, okay?

01:24:48.524 --> 01:24:50.945
Oh, allow me.

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.408
<i>Thank you!</i>

01:24:55.786 --> 01:24:58.305
Now, about these people I live with.

01:25:00.617 --> 01:25:03.267
What we've got
to plan is-

01:25:04.305 --> 01:25:10.195
