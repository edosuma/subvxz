00:52.408 --> 00:54.474
See, this is me, Da Xia.

00:55.907 --> 00:57.574
Want to know what I'm doing?

00:57.608 --> 01:00.341
Hee, I'm preparing
a big yummy meal

01:00.374 --> 01:01.807
for my baby son.

01:22.907 --> 01:27.107
If I have a weak spot, it is
that I love my son too much.

01:28.242 --> 01:29.940
You let that thing go!

01:47.940 --> 01:49.041
Xi Ha?

01:49.074 --> 01:50.074
Son?

01:50.874 --> 01:53.141
I'm bringing you your
watermelon honey salad.

03:47.142 --> 03:47.974
It's dangerous!

03:48.007 --> 03:49.142
Get down here!

04:13.174 --> 04:14.907
Yee-ha!

04:14.940 --> 04:16.141
Daddy, make a wish.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.075
Hey big guy, you
trying to scare me?

04:18.108 --> 04:19.839
Come home with me.

04:23.007 --> 04:24.141
Hurry.

04:24.174 --> 04:26.042
Hey, Dad.

04:29.874 --> 04:31.341
You saw that too!

04:31.374 --> 04:33.874
Am I super or what?

04:33.907 --> 04:36.274
You little one, you have
no idea what you're doing.

04:36.308 --> 04:38.474
What if you fall off?

04:38.508 --> 04:40.341
What would I do?

04:40.374 --> 04:42.541
Today
is your birthday,

04:42.574 --> 04:45.075
and I just wanted
to surprise you.

04:45.874 --> 04:48.508
It's a surprise, but
please, no accidents.

04:51.341 --> 04:52.441
You know Dad's wish?

04:53.374 --> 04:54.974
I wish...

04:55.008 --> 04:58.008
You were like a bee
everday, just flying around!

04:58.042 --> 04:59.075
What, you,

04:59.107 --> 05:01.074
how can you say
something like that?

05:01.107 --> 05:03.374
Where did you get
all this stuff?

05:03.408 --> 05:05.141
If your mom was still
here, she would...

05:05.174 --> 05:06.608
She would?

05:06.641 --> 05:08.174
You said my mom would
come back when I grew up,

05:08.207 --> 05:09.408
where is she now?

05:09.441 --> 05:11.107
I'm going to find her!

05:12.042 --> 05:13.042
Where will you go?

05:13.074 --> 05:14.107
She's not coming back!

05:24.141 --> 05:25.141
You're a liar!

05:48.441 --> 05:52.408
Huh?

05:59.541 --> 06:01.241
Dad, over there!

06:05.241 --> 06:06.941
These woods are something.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.174
Come on, don't let 'em go.

06:23.274 --> 06:25.274
Dad, are you alright?

06:25.308 --> 06:26.308
Don't worry about me!

06:26.341 --> 06:28.241
- You just go! Did you hear me?
- No!

06:28.274 --> 06:32.007
I already lost my mom,
I'm not gonna lose my dad!

06:32.908 --> 06:34.441
You jerks, let me go!

06:37.074 --> 06:40.207
Son!

06:40.241 --> 06:41.441
Today is a good day.

06:41.474 --> 06:44.341
Let's go deliver this
one and get the cash.

06:49.974 --> 06:54.908
Let go of my son!

07:29.141 --> 07:30.608
Dad, dad, save me!

07:30.641 --> 07:32.574
Don't be afraid, son!

08:20.041 --> 08:20.874
Xi Ha.

08:24.374 --> 08:25.207
Xi Ha!

08:30.641 --> 08:34.274
Xi Ha!

09:15.308 --> 09:19.441
Let go of him.

09:41.107 --> 09:41.907
Ah!

09:50.107 --> 09:52.840
Come, Xi Ha, come here to Mama.

09:52.874 --> 09:53.474
Mommy?

09:53.508 --> 09:54.574
Mommy!

09:55.974 --> 09:57.174
Daddy lied to me.

09:57.207 --> 09:58.574
He said you wouldn't
come back to me.

09:58.608 --> 10:00.974
Xi Ha, Mom will
always be here for you.

10:02.408 --> 10:03.840
Mama!

10:11.508 --> 10:13.807
Let go of her!

10:28.508 --> 10:30.041
Da Xia!

10:30.074 --> 10:31.441
Take good care of our son!

10:36.007 --> 10:36.807
No!

10:38.474 --> 10:40.341
Don't leave me.

10:48.174 --> 10:48.974
Huh?

10:54.074 --> 10:55.308
Where is this place?

11:10.241 --> 11:11.541
What's that sound?

11:17.341 --> 11:18.341
What is this place?

11:18.374 --> 11:19.907
Even dogs can fly.

11:23.107 --> 11:25.007
That iron monster
took Xi Ha away!

11:43.074 --> 11:44.541
I can smell him!

11:44.574 --> 11:45.840
Xi Ha, dad is here!

12:19.174 --> 12:20.174
Thank you.

12:27.974 --> 12:29.508
Where am I?

12:33.609 --> 12:37.141
That was the guy who
held in those monsters.

12:37.174 --> 12:38.141
What does he want?

12:46.474 --> 12:47.474
Don't go!

12:54.907 --> 12:56.341
Hey,
what are you doing?

12:56.374 --> 13:01.174
What are you doing?

13:01.207 --> 13:03.441
Come on,
hurry, over there!

13:03.474 --> 13:04.508
Go
where you belong.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.542
Come on, get outta here.

13:17.174 --> 13:18.608
That monster.

13:18.641 --> 13:20.274
We have to be careful this time.

13:20.308 --> 13:21.940
Don't let him run away again.

13:23.874 --> 13:25.940
- Ooh!
- He's so big!

13:25.974 --> 13:29.074
I wanna go
up, I wanna go up!

13:32.608 --> 13:34.341
Looks like it's real!

13:49.408 --> 13:50.907
Over there, come on!

13:50.940 --> 13:52.542
That kid!

13:52.574 --> 13:54.840
Oh no!

13:54.874 --> 13:56.141
That's my grandson!

14:09.141 --> 14:10.874
Somebody save him!

14:10.907 --> 14:11.574
No!

14:32.907 --> 14:33.874
Wow!

14:33.907 --> 14:35.174
This bear looks real!

14:44.541 --> 14:45.574
Hey.

14:45.608 --> 14:46.874
Come with me.

15:03.608 --> 15:04.541
Pull over.

15:04.574 --> 15:05.574
Go check the van.

15:11.874 --> 15:12.940
All okay.

15:12.974 --> 15:17.974
Let's go.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.141
Uh, boss?

15:43.174 --> 15:46.574
Uh, we got everything;
well, almost everything.

15:54.907 --> 15:56.007
Hmm.

16:05.007 --> 16:05.840
Hmm.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.574
Boss, this
is very hard to get.

16:20.608 --> 16:21.408
Next time...

16:21.441 --> 16:22.874
Silence.

16:25.974 --> 16:27.840
There is no next
time in my world.

16:29.508 --> 16:31.907
We either get the panda,
or I'll put you in a cage

16:31.940 --> 16:34.207
and give you to the buyer.

16:34.241 --> 16:35.940
Yes, yes sir, of course, boss.

16:36.940 --> 16:39.375
- The Xu Wong Company.
- Right.

16:39.408 --> 16:40.940
Its cover is a
logistics company,

16:40.974 --> 16:44.107
but its actual business
is smuggling rare animals.

16:44.141 --> 16:46.241
Animals and agents
hate their guts.

16:46.274 --> 16:48.840
Their leader is called Xu Wong.

16:52.074 --> 16:53.342
The warehouse
you said earlier...

16:53.374 --> 16:56.274
Before delivery, they
hold all the animals

16:56.309 --> 16:57.241
in the warehouse.

16:58.408 --> 17:01.041
Nobody knows where it is.

17:01.074 --> 17:02.207
It's all kept secret.

17:03.608 --> 17:06.874
My owner and I tried raiding
this place several times

17:06.906 --> 17:08.275
and found nothing.

17:08.309 --> 17:10.940
Finally, we spotted the location
of the secret warehouse,

17:10.973 --> 17:12.906
so I know you're here
to save your son.

17:14.107 --> 17:18.007
But entering the
warehouse is very hard.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.407
Your son is definitely there.

17:19.441 --> 17:21.241
You're going to use your
enormously big strength

17:21.275 --> 17:23.508
to help me sneak
inside the warehouse.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.874
Only with my perfect
plan and my high-tech kit

17:25.906 --> 17:28.608
can we save your son
and the other animals.

17:28.641 --> 17:29.608
- But...
- But you have to pass

17:29.641 --> 17:30.840
my special training.

17:30.874 --> 17:31.940
Then you can join me.

17:33.874 --> 17:34.907
Are you done, little dude?

17:34.940 --> 17:36.408
Wanna hear my plan?

17:36.441 --> 17:37.374
Huh?

17:37.408 --> 17:39.007
You have a plan too?

17:39.041 --> 17:40.940
- Let's hear it.
- This is my plan.

17:40.974 --> 17:43.907
We get out of these stupid
woods, then pick up my son

17:43.940 --> 17:44.974
from the Xu Wong Company.

17:45.007 --> 17:46.141
If anyone gets in the way,

17:46.174 --> 17:47.608
he can try my claw!

17:50.207 --> 17:52.940
I see you've got a lot of
courage to save the animals,

17:52.974 --> 17:55.074
but who knows if, aside
from this brute force,

17:55.107 --> 17:57.041
you're only a rookie
bear, a newbie.

17:57.074 --> 17:57.907
Humph.

17:58.974 --> 18:01.041
With what you've got, you'll
just deliver your own death

18:01.074 --> 18:03.441
to them, and no coming back.

18:03.474 --> 18:05.141
Your problem is
obvious; take this,

18:05.174 --> 18:06.874
start training immediately.

18:09.007 --> 18:12.308
You have a problem as well:
you like to lecture people.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.041
I came all the way here not
to listen to your nagging.

18:15.074 --> 18:17.541
My son is still
in the snake nest.

18:17.574 --> 18:18.974
Goodbye.

18:19.007 --> 18:20.874
I guess you can't even
escape from the woods!

18:27.274 --> 18:29.840
What should we
do, Brother Xianxi?

18:29.874 --> 18:31.608
What should we do, huh?

18:31.641 --> 18:33.041
How about painting
black eyes on me

18:33.074 --> 18:34.840
and putting me in a cage?

18:34.874 --> 18:36.007
Oh, alright.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.474
My eyes!

18:37.508 --> 18:39.408
What do you think
you're doing, you idiot?

18:39.441 --> 18:42.341
I'm coloring
your eyes black!

18:42.374 --> 18:45.974
Okay, I was kidding!

18:46.007 --> 18:48.074
That's enough, I
was kidding; got it?

18:53.175 --> 18:55.974
Pull over, pull over, pull over!

18:57.175 --> 18:58.541
Hmm.

18:58.574 --> 19:00.074
This little bear.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.007
- Okay.
- Let's take care of this.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.508
Paint this bear to
look like a panda.

19:05.541 --> 19:07.175
Holy moly.

19:15.074 --> 19:17.274
You can't even get
down from here, humph.

19:17.308 --> 19:19.107
I chased you down
from the forest,

19:19.142 --> 19:21.175
how can I not get out
of these stupid woods?

19:21.208 --> 19:22.508
What's so hard about them?

19:27.907 --> 19:30.142
Do you think this little
trick can take me out?

19:30.175 --> 19:31.041
No way.

19:32.940 --> 19:34.142
Huh?

19:41.241 --> 19:42.974
I'm already out.

19:43.007 --> 19:44.374
If rolling out counts.

19:46.074 --> 19:49.175
Listen, I do need
your strong power,

19:49.207 --> 19:51.907
but you also need my
plan and my training.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.541
Otherwise, we can't
save our target.

19:56.940 --> 19:59.408
That is not how Xu
Wong treats his guests.

19:59.441 --> 20:01.174
I'm here to protect you.

20:01.207 --> 20:03.007
You have to pass my
special training.

20:03.041 --> 20:06.041
Only by working as a
team can we save Xi Ha.

20:07.341 --> 20:08.341
My name is Da Xia.

20:10.207 --> 20:11.574
I am Agent Hun To.

20:17.641 --> 20:18.907
High climbing, focus.

20:40.874 --> 20:42.174
You jerk!

20:42.207 --> 20:43.974
Leave my pigeons alone!

20:50.007 --> 20:52.075
Last one, save
the toy animals.

20:52.108 --> 20:52.874
Go, go, go!

21:04.940 --> 21:06.174
Wow.

21:06.207 --> 21:07.574
There's a giant bear!

21:11.207 --> 21:13.042
Oh, and a crazy dog?

21:18.341 --> 21:20.408
Look outside.

21:21.274 --> 21:22.107
Look!

21:27.107 --> 21:27.907
Oh, the puppy!

21:38.107 --> 21:39.508
Kids, is everything okay?

21:39.541 --> 21:41.042
I'm fine, I'm fine!

21:41.074 --> 21:43.441
You won't
believe what we saw!

21:43.474 --> 21:44.940
I screwed up again.

21:44.974 --> 21:46.508
But you saved those kids.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.174
Tonight, we are
going to save Xi Ha.

21:51.074 --> 21:52.008
Welcome aboard.

22:44.074 --> 22:44.907
Come on.

22:44.941 --> 22:46.174
Come on out here.

22:46.207 --> 22:47.308
Come on, little guy.

22:49.941 --> 22:52.174
Looks like we're going to
bring out the big gun here.

22:52.207 --> 22:53.141
Look.

22:53.174 --> 22:55.107
Here, yummy, yummy!

22:55.141 --> 22:56.274
Come and get it!

23:01.341 --> 23:03.174
Yeah, take that.

23:03.207 --> 23:04.241
Stay there.

23:17.107 --> 23:18.041
Oh my God!

23:18.074 --> 23:20.541
Don't come out!

23:35.541 --> 23:38.974
Upload the file,
tally the cargo,

23:39.007 --> 23:40.474
ship these before midnight.

23:41.441 --> 23:43.308
Yes sir, boss.

23:43.341 --> 23:44.174
Hmm.

23:45.207 --> 23:49.574
Tell everyone here: tonight,
no one can make any mistakes!

23:49.608 --> 23:50.408
Yes sir!

23:54.341 --> 23:56.007
The final battle is tonight.

23:56.041 --> 23:56.875
Are you ready?

23:57.940 --> 23:58.541
What are you doing?

23:58.574 --> 24:00.574
What am I wearing?

24:00.608 --> 24:02.608
My fur got stuck.

24:02.641 --> 24:05.408
You're on my team and you're
gonna act like an agent.

24:08.641 --> 24:11.107
It looks just like mine.

24:11.141 --> 24:14.141
This badge represents the
spirit of an animal agent,

24:14.174 --> 24:15.374
who never gives up.

24:18.608 --> 24:20.141
Save my son?

24:20.174 --> 24:21.241
Give up, never!

24:54.074 --> 24:55.308
Hm.

24:55.341 --> 24:56.808
Hey, the boy is at
the zoo, you know.

25:00.308 --> 25:01.341
Hi!

25:02.374 --> 25:03.207
Hi, panda!

25:13.641 --> 25:15.874
What is your name?

25:15.907 --> 25:17.041
I am Xi Ha.

25:18.174 --> 25:19.341
I am Yei Yei.

25:19.374 --> 25:20.907
You are very cool.

25:20.940 --> 25:23.274
Yei Yei, let's go
outside and have fun.

25:23.308 --> 25:27.041
Mm, I wish I could,
but the cage is locked.

25:30.374 --> 25:31.441
Oh.

25:31.474 --> 25:32.308
Uh.

25:37.007 --> 25:38.074
Just open it!

25:48.074 --> 25:49.441
If it
was easy to open,

25:49.474 --> 25:51.441
we would have already come out.

25:53.041 --> 25:54.074
Are you hungry?

25:54.107 --> 25:55.107
I have some food.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.274
Looks like he won't
be of much help.

26:01.308 --> 26:03.174
But he's outside the cage.

26:03.207 --> 26:04.041
Hmm.

26:12.274 --> 26:14.074
Look out!

26:20.007 --> 26:22.508
Look
at his stupid face!

26:31.308 --> 26:33.508
Mr. Tiger, thanks
for helping me out.

26:35.341 --> 26:36.474
Just call me Tai Hu.

26:37.641 --> 26:40.441
I am the leader of
these poor animals.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.907
I apologize for the
reckless behavior

26:42.940 --> 26:44.408
of Mongolia Wolf.

26:44.441 --> 26:45.408
That's fine.

26:45.441 --> 26:48.508
Mr. Tai Hu, I am Xi Ha.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.974
Da Xia's son; this little
thing won't get me.

26:54.541 --> 26:56.408
Uncle Rhino, are you hungry?

26:56.441 --> 26:57.508
Would you like some food?

26:59.107 --> 27:01.141
Thanks for your kindness.

27:01.174 --> 27:03.341
I would like to leave the
food to the little animals

27:03.374 --> 27:05.174
who need it most.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.508
Like your friend, Yei Yei.

27:09.341 --> 27:10.840
Huh?

27:10.874 --> 27:12.508
So we're friends!

27:14.508 --> 27:16.207
Cool!

27:16.241 --> 27:20.341
I have two awesome friends
that will teach my dad

27:20.374 --> 27:21.874
not to spank me.

27:27.541 --> 27:29.840
Xi Ha, we need your help.

27:34.074 --> 27:35.074
Let's go.

28:00.141 --> 28:00.974
Woo!

28:13.041 --> 28:14.207
Tonight is a big night.

28:14.241 --> 28:16.241
Something seems wrong.

28:16.274 --> 28:17.840
The terrible snake nest.

28:17.874 --> 28:19.374
Come on, follow me.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.107
What's going on?

28:46.174 --> 28:47.541
Incoming, hide.

28:58.241 --> 28:59.441
A monster!

28:59.474 --> 29:00.474
Stay away!

29:00.508 --> 29:02.007
Stay away from me!

29:09.274 --> 29:10.141
Put on his clothes.

29:10.174 --> 29:11.007
Let's go in.

29:12.508 --> 29:13.840
This is our plan.

29:17.874 --> 29:20.041
Is this for real?

29:20.074 --> 29:21.609
Will you help us?

29:33.874 --> 29:34.608
Sure.

29:34.641 --> 29:36.508
I will help you all.

29:39.174 --> 29:40.974
You have to be extra careful.

29:41.007 --> 29:43.474
If things go wrong,
just give up.

29:44.341 --> 29:45.508
Protect yourself.

29:45.542 --> 29:47.341
Mr. Tai Hu, don't worry.

29:48.542 --> 29:50.141
What a brave boy.

29:52.575 --> 29:53.408
Xi Ha.

29:57.007 --> 30:02.007
Hmm.

30:15.207 --> 30:16.174
There are two
people out front.

30:16.207 --> 30:17.840
Get there as fast as you can.

30:17.874 --> 30:18.509
Take them down

30:19.542 --> 30:20.840
if you're exposed.

30:22.542 --> 30:24.041
Meet me at the cargo elevator.

30:31.940 --> 30:32.874
Where do
you think you're going?

30:40.141 --> 30:41.241
I already won!

30:41.274 --> 30:42.074
Ha!

30:43.408 --> 30:45.341
- Let's go one more.
- You can't beat me.

30:50.274 --> 30:51.907
And I broke your record.

30:51.940 --> 30:53.608
I can't find you boys anywhere

30:53.641 --> 30:55.574
and you're in here?

30:55.608 --> 30:57.940
Playing games and
breaking records?

30:59.274 --> 31:01.374
Look at these temp workers,
getting hands dirty

31:01.408 --> 31:03.007
and working so hard!

31:03.041 --> 31:04.341
- And look at yourselves!
- We'll do better next time.

31:04.374 --> 31:05.974
- Two slackers!
- Don't hit me!

31:06.007 --> 31:07.141
Next time?

31:07.174 --> 31:08.374
Don't tell me about next time!

31:08.408 --> 31:10.241
Never tell me about next time!

31:10.274 --> 31:12.007
Brother, brother!

31:12.041 --> 31:12.608
Where's the panda?

31:12.641 --> 31:13.907
Did you lock up?

31:14.641 --> 31:16.442
- The panda!
- What?

31:16.475 --> 31:17.408
You are such an idiot!

31:21.241 --> 31:23.074
Nicely done.

31:23.107 --> 31:24.475
You look like a real agent.

31:26.174 --> 31:27.007
Huh?

31:30.408 --> 31:31.608
The tiger and the panda.

31:31.641 --> 31:35.007
Xu Wong is moving big time.

31:35.041 --> 31:36.308
Thank you.

31:36.341 --> 31:38.907
To save my son, you
risked your own life

31:38.940 --> 31:40.274
entering this horrible place.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.474
I really appreciate it.

31:45.907 --> 31:47.940
Xi Ha will really
like his cool uncle.

31:47.974 --> 31:48.807
Stop talking.

31:51.308 --> 31:52.174
Just stop talking.

31:53.374 --> 31:55.508
Let's just focus and
save the animals.

32:03.274 --> 32:04.308
You stupid moron!

32:04.341 --> 32:05.409
I can't believe you!

32:06.308 --> 32:08.508
Can't you do anything right?

32:08.541 --> 32:10.508
You can't even lock the cage.

32:10.541 --> 32:11.940
Didn't I teach you?

32:11.974 --> 32:13.508
Huh, huh, huh?

32:13.541 --> 32:14.409
No, no!

32:14.441 --> 32:15.375
You jackass!

32:16.641 --> 32:18.840
Take this, take that!

32:18.874 --> 32:19.508
What?

32:20.375 --> 32:22.007
Stop, stop!

32:22.041 --> 32:27.041
Stop!

32:42.541 --> 32:44.308
What did you do?

32:44.342 --> 32:45.907
What did you?

32:45.940 --> 32:47.041
What did you do?

32:47.974 --> 32:49.608
What did you do?

32:49.641 --> 32:51.840
What can
we tell the boss?

32:51.874 --> 32:54.207
What are we gonna do?

32:54.241 --> 32:55.274
We're doomed!

32:55.308 --> 32:56.408
We're doomed!

33:05.007 --> 33:08.375
Brother, take a look.

33:39.541 --> 33:40.874
Get out of the way!

33:40.907 --> 33:42.907
You almost ruined my big plan!

33:48.007 --> 33:51.374
You make me always have to do
everything myself.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.373
- Yeah!
- Yay, he found the card!

34:25.041 --> 34:27.940
Password decoding initiated.

34:27.974 --> 34:31.041
Damn!

34:31.074 --> 34:33.474
What happened?

34:33.507 --> 34:35.041
It's a virus, leave me alone!

34:35.074 --> 34:37.507
Check if you have the
door-entry card in your pocket!

34:40.574 --> 34:42.074
Permission denied.

34:42.107 --> 34:44.107
Permission denied.

34:44.141 --> 34:45.474
Permission denied.

34:59.974 --> 35:01.441
Don't
let him run away!

35:58.041 --> 35:59.474
Good job, Xi Ha.

35:59.508 --> 36:02.041
Once the door is opened,
we can all escape together.

36:04.641 --> 36:06.541
You were
itching so much.

36:06.574 --> 36:09.142
When was the last time
you took a shower?

36:09.175 --> 36:11.241
Password decoding
failed just now.

36:11.274 --> 36:13.341
The virus invaded the system,

36:13.374 --> 36:15.541
and the itchy bomb exploded it.

36:15.574 --> 36:18.940
It was an accident.

36:20.508 --> 36:22.207
A scratchy accident.

36:23.874 --> 36:25.074
Don't you wanna go in?

36:27.341 --> 36:29.207
How can we match
the right password?

36:31.041 --> 36:31.874
Oh, wait.

36:37.041 --> 36:39.041
You load the train first,
I'll check things out.

36:39.074 --> 36:40.374
Okay,
Brother Xianxi.

36:44.207 --> 36:46.174
We've been working
late all these days.

36:46.207 --> 36:47.608
When can we have a rest?

36:47.641 --> 36:48.474
Huh?

36:49.541 --> 36:50.374
Huh?

36:51.441 --> 36:52.508
Hey you!

36:52.541 --> 36:55.142
You, you, you, you, you!

36:55.174 --> 36:57.874
You were the tall guy who
carried the case just now, right?

36:59.142 --> 37:00.474
You performed well today.

37:02.207 --> 37:04.108
You lazy guys, get back to work!

37:04.142 --> 37:04.940
Hurry up!

37:04.974 --> 37:05.608
Come on!

37:05.641 --> 37:07.174
Hmm?

37:07.207 --> 37:08.041
Hmm?

37:19.007 --> 37:20.141
What is that?

37:20.174 --> 37:21.174
Ah, my eyes!

37:25.907 --> 37:27.907
Looks like he might
have a door card.

37:27.940 --> 37:28.807
Search him.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.474
Hun To!

37:59.508 --> 38:00.341
Hun To!

38:01.574 --> 38:02.408
Hun To!

38:09.374 --> 38:11.007
What is this place?

38:11.042 --> 38:12.574
Where did you hide my son?

38:14.274 --> 38:15.141
Give me back my son!

38:15.174 --> 38:16.940
Xu Wong!

39:04.241 --> 39:05.141
Hey, wait!

39:05.174 --> 39:06.308
Hurry!

39:40.074 --> 39:41.474
Catch that panda!

39:50.941 --> 39:52.041
Run, kiddo!

40:20.441 --> 40:23.007
He was the
guy in your photo.

40:23.041 --> 40:24.408
What's the situation now?

40:24.441 --> 40:26.341
What the hell is this place?

40:27.174 --> 40:30.007
He's
Agent 502, my owner.

40:31.174 --> 40:33.574
Several days ago, we
broke into the warehouse

40:33.608 --> 40:35.341
and almost saved
all those animals,

40:36.441 --> 40:37.974
but I was exposed.

40:38.007 --> 40:41.840
My owner saved me, but he
was captured instead, so.

40:41.875 --> 40:44.875
So, you
managed to break into

40:44.908 --> 40:46.174
this horrible place.

40:47.441 --> 40:49.908
Where on earth is my son?

40:49.940 --> 40:51.074
Huh?

40:51.107 --> 40:52.274
He's in the warehouse.

40:55.074 --> 40:56.940
Da Xia, let me explain!

40:58.341 --> 40:59.374
Da Xia!

41:01.241 --> 41:02.541
Stop your nonsense.

41:03.974 --> 41:04.875
Da Xia!

42:02.408 --> 42:04.141
Why haven't the
goods been delivered?

42:04.174 --> 42:05.274
Where is Xianxi?

42:18.341 --> 42:21.174
Close door one, two,
and three, immediately!

42:21.207 --> 42:22.007
Yes!

42:29.874 --> 42:31.574
You guys get ready
by the front door.

42:31.608 --> 42:32.441
The rest,

42:34.041 --> 42:36.308
make sure to block the
entrance to the back door.

42:36.341 --> 42:37.840
No one can get away.

42:37.874 --> 42:38.940
Yes boss!

43:01.874 --> 43:02.974
We're exposed!

43:03.007 --> 43:03.907
Let's move!

43:03.940 --> 43:05.141
You go first!

43:07.341 --> 43:09.907
I'm going
to look for my son!

43:12.041 --> 43:14.840
I command you to stop
this action right now!

43:35.608 --> 43:38.074
Is that you, Dad?

43:47.441 --> 43:48.474
What?

43:53.508 --> 43:54.308
No, Dad!

44:00.374 --> 44:01.374
That was close!

44:03.374 --> 44:05.007
Ah, what a tough guy!

44:05.874 --> 44:07.374
Da Xia!

44:10.207 --> 44:11.974
No!

44:12.007 --> 44:13.541
No!

44:13.574 --> 44:15.007
It was all your fault!

44:27.174 --> 44:30.441
If you are also captured,
there will be no hope for Xi Ha!

44:34.441 --> 44:35.608
Follow me.

44:35.642 --> 44:38.007
We could turn to
the agent for help.

44:38.041 --> 44:39.541
Then we can get the animals out,

44:39.574 --> 44:41.574
and catch all the bad guys!

44:41.608 --> 44:42.574
Forget about the agent!

44:42.608 --> 44:44.541
Forget about the plan!

44:44.574 --> 44:46.474
Today might be my last one,

44:46.508 --> 44:49.308
but I have to see my son!

44:49.341 --> 44:51.074
Da Xia!

44:53.574 --> 44:55.241
Da Xia, I...

44:55.274 --> 44:57.174
I shouldn't have trusted
you in the first place.

44:57.207 --> 44:59.840
Pet dogs are full of lies!

44:59.874 --> 45:01.274
Only know how to use friends.

45:01.308 --> 45:02.141
Da Xia.

45:06.207 --> 45:07.041
Da Xia.

45:08.574 --> 45:12.775
We need to find
them!

45:39.474 --> 45:42.007
This way, hurry!

45:52.874 --> 45:54.174
You've got nowhere to run!

45:54.207 --> 45:56.308
Shoot it!

45:56.341 --> 45:57.907
You guys,
come here, quick!

46:02.609 --> 46:03.609
Come on!

46:03.641 --> 46:04.874
Stop it!

47:14.541 --> 47:15.907
Boss!

47:15.940 --> 47:17.940
Boss, all the animals
are running away!

47:17.974 --> 47:18.940
Boss!

47:18.974 --> 47:21.408
It was a temporary
worker that took that dog

47:21.441 --> 47:24.007
and hurt many of our guys!

47:24.041 --> 47:25.174
What?

47:25.207 --> 47:27.509
Another undercover agent?

47:27.541 --> 47:28.974
Door three, copy.

47:36.608 --> 47:38.007
You.

47:38.041 --> 47:39.442
You go there with some men

47:39.475 --> 47:42.241
and tear the undercover
agent there to little pieces!

47:44.641 --> 47:45.574
Yes boss!

47:46.641 --> 47:50.207
Drug all the animals and
load them into the train.

47:50.241 --> 47:53.207
This time, I will
deliver them myself!

47:56.007 --> 47:57.241
Hey, watch out down there!

47:59.274 --> 48:01.241
I wanna get out.

48:01.274 --> 48:02.974
- Where are we going?
- I want to get out.

48:03.675 --> 48:06.874
Trapped forever.

48:08.074 --> 48:11.074
I didn't expect there would
be an invisible gate here.

48:12.241 --> 48:13.807
Our plan totally failed.

48:16.907 --> 48:19.274
I saw my dad behind there.

48:19.308 --> 48:20.207
What?

48:20.241 --> 48:21.274
He was captured here too?

48:24.241 --> 48:25.974
Dad!

48:26.007 --> 48:27.840
Dad!

48:27.874 --> 48:29.574
There must be some
way to get you out.

48:29.608 --> 48:30.840
Think, please.

48:30.874 --> 48:31.474
Dad!

48:31.508 --> 48:33.074
I must find my dad!

48:43.608 --> 48:45.541
Hey, there's a channel here.

48:48.074 --> 48:51.541
Huh?

48:51.574 --> 48:52.409
Huh?

48:53.874 --> 48:54.940
What time is it now?

48:54.974 --> 48:56.375
You actually
defecated a bit early.

48:57.508 --> 48:58.341
I didn't.

50:30.574 --> 50:33.041
Oh.

50:33.074 --> 50:35.107
Tie it and carry it away!

50:42.541 --> 50:43.940
Boss, it was this guy

50:43.974 --> 50:45.007
who has been tricking us!

51:08.174 --> 51:09.508
A bear
scares you like this?

51:09.541 --> 51:12.207
How can I do any
business with you clowns?

51:23.574 --> 51:25.974
You are so overconfident.

51:26.940 --> 51:28.441
Boss, how to deal with it?

51:31.341 --> 51:34.874
Xu Wong Company always knows
how to reward its customers.

51:34.907 --> 51:36.807
Yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

51:40.074 --> 51:41.242
Carry them together.

51:41.274 --> 51:43.508
It'll be a nice
present for the buyer.

51:43.541 --> 51:44.341
Yes.

51:44.374 --> 51:45.174
Load the train!

52:38.641 --> 52:39.541
Let's go.

53:06.874 --> 53:08.241
If we had not
planned to run away,

53:08.274 --> 53:10.974
life would be even
easier for us.

53:11.007 --> 53:13.175
Tai Hu, don't overthink this.

53:13.207 --> 53:14.541
I didn't mean it was your fault.

53:14.574 --> 53:16.840
My child hasn't
waken up 'til now.

53:16.874 --> 53:20.341
It's all because you
pressed us to run away.

53:20.374 --> 53:21.574
What to do now?

53:23.207 --> 53:26.108
My child!

53:26.142 --> 53:27.441
My...

53:27.474 --> 53:31.041
Xi Ha, sometimes we
don't have an explanation,

53:31.074 --> 53:33.874
but we can't lose
direction in our lives.

53:33.907 --> 53:38.574
Kid, if you do the best you
can, miracles will happen.

53:38.608 --> 53:43.108
Maybe your father is
trying to save us now.

53:44.874 --> 53:46.108
Wow.

53:46.142 --> 53:48.940
I believe my dad
will come to save us.

54:18.974 --> 54:19.574
Over there.

54:33.207 --> 54:34.207
Drop it.

55:05.374 --> 55:08.441
Yei Yei, are you
missing your mom and dad?

55:08.474 --> 55:10.308
Are you missing your family?

55:11.940 --> 55:16.508
We can't cry, because mom
and dad are missing us too.

55:16.541 --> 55:20.042
We have to be stronger,
for our loving families.

56:48.274 --> 56:49.107
Dad!

56:53.374 --> 56:54.908
- Dad!
- Xi Ha!

57:16.875 --> 57:18.207
Watch out!

57:18.241 --> 57:20.007
Dad!

57:26.107 --> 57:28.341
Son, who did this to you?

57:29.608 --> 57:30.974
Dad!

57:31.007 --> 57:32.341
I always knew you'd
come to save me!

57:32.374 --> 57:34.474
Son, hold on for a while.

57:36.274 --> 57:37.940
Boss, the goods are ready.

57:37.974 --> 57:39.908
The loading is almost finished.

57:39.940 --> 57:40.541
Oh no.

57:40.574 --> 57:41.940
We have some trouble.

57:41.974 --> 57:43.341
The bear has gone insane!

57:44.608 --> 57:47.441
Start the train
once I get on it.

57:47.474 --> 57:49.241
What a crazy bear.

57:49.274 --> 57:51.174
Don't make me see it any more.

57:51.207 --> 57:53.841
Yes!

57:55.940 --> 57:57.141
- What was that?
- What's going on?

57:57.174 --> 57:59.174
My father
is trying to save us.

58:08.341 --> 58:09.408
Come on, brothers!

58:09.441 --> 58:12.374
We can't let this bear mess
with our heads; get him!

58:12.408 --> 58:17.408
Get him!

58:24.974 --> 58:25.808
Shoot!

58:44.374 --> 58:45.541
No, Dad, no!

58:50.974 --> 58:52.474
Hey!

58:53.874 --> 58:54.840
Yay, Xianxi!

59:01.141 --> 59:02.241
Are you okay, brother?

59:02.274 --> 59:03.408
Why didn't you tell me
that the car hasn't stopped?

59:20.474 --> 59:22.007
Brother Xianxi!

59:29.174 --> 59:32.408
Brother Xianxi!

59:32.441 --> 59:35.207
That was a close
escape to death!

59:38.074 --> 59:39.574
Son!

59:39.608 --> 59:40.574
Hold on!

59:40.608 --> 59:41.940
I'm coming to save you!

59:44.441 --> 59:46.940
Get him, don't let
that bear get away!

59:46.974 --> 59:48.107
Move it, move it!

01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:05.940
And today, you will
find out who I am.

01:00:13.107 --> 01:00:14.141
Catch him.

01:00:14.174 --> 01:00:15.974
- Catch him, hurry!
- Yes.

01:00:48.574 --> 01:00:51.041
Here we go!

01:00:56.174 --> 01:00:57.007
Hey!

01:01:16.007 --> 01:01:16.840
Where is it?

01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:51.508
He told me he was
gonna get me out.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.441
My dad is a big liar.

01:01:55.574 --> 01:01:58.041
My dad is a big liar.

01:02:03.907 --> 01:02:06.274
My mom left me first
and now my dad too;

01:02:06.308 --> 01:02:08.474
I'm alone now, I
have nothing left.

01:02:08.508 --> 01:02:10.341
Who says you are alone?

01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:12.609
We are also your family, Xi Ha.

01:02:12.641 --> 01:02:14.107
I'm your family too!

01:02:14.141 --> 01:02:14.940
Me too.

01:02:14.974 --> 01:02:15.874
And me.

01:02:15.907 --> 01:02:16.940
We're all family!

01:02:16.974 --> 01:02:17.807
Really?

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.974
Could I be part of your family?

01:02:27.575 --> 01:02:28.508
Whoa!

01:02:31.907 --> 01:02:33.840
So why is everyone so happy?

01:02:33.874 --> 01:02:34.609
Count me in.

01:02:34.641 --> 01:02:36.041
Oh, Dad!

01:02:36.074 --> 01:02:37.907
Great, you're still alive!

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.542
What's everyone talking about?

01:02:45.641 --> 01:02:47.474
I heard everything just now.

01:02:47.508 --> 01:02:49.308
Thank you for what
you've done for Xi Ha.

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:00.608
Daddy!

01:03:00.641 --> 01:03:03.107
The fat guy painted me
like a panda, and luckily,

01:03:03.141 --> 01:03:06.374
Mr. Tai Hu saved me, and
I made a lot of friends.

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.508
Dad, I missed you so much!

01:03:12.241 --> 01:03:15.341
Daddy!

01:03:20.441 --> 01:03:22.574
It's so great that
you're still alive.

01:03:22.608 --> 01:03:26.074
There's still so many animals
locked in the compartment.

01:03:26.107 --> 01:03:27.408
Let's go save them!

01:03:35.274 --> 01:03:37.341
If you want to beat
Xu Wong, follow me!

01:04:02.641 --> 01:04:04.408
It's clear for now.

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.940
I will stay to protect
them and give you backup.

01:04:23.107 --> 01:04:24.608
Dad, look out!

01:04:34.374 --> 01:04:38.107
Don't be afraid!

01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:48.475
Huh?

01:05:01.974 --> 01:05:03.007
You idiot.

01:05:03.907 --> 01:05:05.974
You almost killed the panda.

01:06:24.974 --> 01:06:26.441
Dad, your arm.

01:06:26.474 --> 01:06:27.874
Huh?

01:06:27.907 --> 01:06:30.474
Just a little
sting by a small bee.

01:06:30.508 --> 01:06:33.974
Don't worry, I feel
nothing.

01:06:38.007 --> 01:06:40.007
Oh, is this for real?

01:06:41.907 --> 01:06:43.940
A bear saving a panda.

01:07:04.041 --> 01:07:05.342
Stay out of this.

01:07:06.508 --> 01:07:08.408
Today, I'll let
you see me shoot.

01:07:09.974 --> 01:07:13.141
Ooh, oh.

01:07:13.174 --> 01:07:15.174
I'm almost tearing up.

01:07:46.374 --> 01:07:47.207
Run!

01:07:51.907 --> 01:07:53.374
What bird is that?

01:07:56.242 --> 01:08:00.907
Hun To, I
knew you would come back!

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:05.207
Hun To, is that
the name of the dog bird?

01:08:08.207 --> 01:08:10.107
What'd you just say to me?

01:08:10.141 --> 01:08:11.541
I'm not a dog bird.

01:08:11.574 --> 01:08:13.141
You can call me Agent Hun To.

01:08:15.107 --> 01:08:17.308
Are you sure the
panda is your son?

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.541
Oh no!

01:08:22.573 --> 01:08:24.041
The train is losing control!

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:28.107
There's a bend ahead.

01:08:29.508 --> 01:08:30.308
Hurry!

01:08:30.341 --> 01:08:31.242
Let's help Hun To!

01:08:37.207 --> 01:08:38.939
Something's wrong
with the train.

01:08:38.974 --> 01:08:39.840
I'll have a look.

01:08:46.907 --> 01:08:48.274
Some men are coming towards us!

01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:23.874
Come down.

01:09:25.274 --> 01:09:27.474
The control room has
been destroyed by Xu Wong.

01:09:27.508 --> 01:09:29.107
We can't slow the train down.

01:09:29.142 --> 01:09:30.142
It's going to derail.

01:09:30.175 --> 01:09:31.241
All the animals may be doomed.

01:09:35.274 --> 01:09:36.408
This is the weakest link.

01:09:36.441 --> 01:09:38.041
I can only manage from here.

01:09:42.274 --> 01:09:44.939
None of the animals
could escape from me!

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:49.474
Leave this to me.

01:09:49.508 --> 01:09:52.207
Don't let this snake run away.

01:10:01.074 --> 01:10:03.207
It's too hard to pull out!

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.174
Dad, we're
running out of time!

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.408
Dad, look there!

01:10:55.441 --> 01:10:58.108
Xi Ha, you found
the key point.

01:10:58.141 --> 01:10:59.241
Pull out the lock pin.

01:10:59.274 --> 01:11:00.241
I'll handle this!

01:11:44.107 --> 01:11:45.308
Dad, come on!

01:12:09.641 --> 01:12:10.608
Dad!

01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:11.907
Dad, come up!

01:12:14.441 --> 01:12:15.241
Come up!

01:12:16.574 --> 01:12:18.308
Listen, son.

01:12:18.341 --> 01:12:20.141
Mama and Dad will
never leave you.

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:23.508
We'll love you forever.

01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:28.474
Take care of yourself!

01:12:28.508 --> 01:12:33.508
Dad!

01:13:22.641 --> 01:13:23.474
Da Xia!

01:13:25.374 --> 01:13:26.441
Where are you?

01:13:26.474 --> 01:13:27.308
Da Xia!

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:36.408
I promise you, I will
take care of myself.

01:13:39.974 --> 01:13:41.007
Good boy.

01:13:43.408 --> 01:13:44.341
Dad?

01:13:48.441 --> 01:13:49.274
Dad, Dad!

01:13:50.408 --> 01:13:51.241
Dad!

01:14:03.141 --> 01:14:05.374
Now, I am proud to
award the Wilderness Medal

01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:08.940
to Agent Hun To, and for
Agent 502, we award the title

01:14:08.974 --> 01:14:10.274
of Wilderness Guard.

01:14:10.308 --> 01:14:12.408
Given the special contributions
made by the animals

01:14:12.441 --> 01:14:14.974
in the field, we establish
the Animal Agent Team,

01:14:15.007 --> 01:14:16.974
with Agent Hun To
serving as leader.

01:14:20.007 --> 01:14:21.908
You can
select your team members.

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:41.974
So, am I good dad?

01:14:43.907 --> 01:14:45.541
You're the best one!

01:14:47.641 --> 01:14:51.408
The rabbit-style
massage feels so good.

01:14:52.441 --> 01:14:54.574
Ah, good!

01:14:54.608 --> 01:14:56.107
A little harder.

01:14:56.141 --> 01:14:56.974
Ah!

01:14:57.907 --> 01:14:59.874
- Huh?
- Friends!

01:14:59.907 --> 01:15:01.841
The Animal Agent Team needs you!

01:15:03.907 --> 01:15:04.874
Let's take off!

01:15:04.907 --> 01:15:05.541
Come on!

01:15:29.172 --> 01:15:34.172
