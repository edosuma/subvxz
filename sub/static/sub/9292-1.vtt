00:21.033 --> 00:22.567
Jack, this is hard for me.

00:22.634 --> 00:23.868
The Chinese have proof

00:23.934 --> 00:26.100
that you led the assault
on their consulate.

00:26.167 --> 00:28.067
And now the Chinese want me.

00:28.133 --> 00:29.300
That's right.

00:29.367 --> 00:31.033
Listen to me very carefully.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.067
The man they sent to take you
into custody

00:33.133 --> 00:34.133
has orders to kill you.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.934
Orders from who?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.801
Someone in Logan's camp.

00:37.868 --> 00:40.100
Bill Spaulding,
Secret Service.

00:40.167 --> 00:42.267
<i>I have orders to take</i>
<i>Jack Bauer into custody.</i>

00:42.334 --> 00:44.133
<i>I intend to execute</i>
<i>those orders.</i>

00:47.667 --> 00:48.501
Jack!

00:50.133 --> 00:51.868
He's dead.

00:51.934 --> 00:53.968
I'm sorry.

00:55.267 --> 00:57.100
Oh, Jack!

01:00.167 --> 01:01.634
Give me the epinephrine.

01:03.701 --> 01:05.767
CHLOE:
I hope it's not too late.
He really looks dead.

01:05.834 --> 01:07.334
Come on, Jack!

01:07.400 --> 01:09.901
Come on, Jack, damn it!

01:14.267 --> 01:15.567
Hey.

01:15.634 --> 01:17.000
All right, Chloe, I need you

01:17.067 --> 01:19.100
to run interference
with the local coroner.

01:19.167 --> 01:20.801
Make sure
their database

01:20.868 --> 01:22.434
synchs up with Jack's
information.

01:22.501 --> 01:24.501
That won't cover the autopsy.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.267
There's not going
to be an autopsy.

01:26.334 --> 01:27.934
They wanted Jack dead,
now he's dead.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.067
Mr. President,
you saved my life.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.667
PALMER:
I'm only sorry it came to this.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.801
I just wanted to let you know
that I was out.

01:33.868 --> 01:35.267
I'm glad.

01:35.334 --> 01:37.667
Jack, you do understand
that when you hang up,

01:37.734 --> 01:40.868
for all intents and purposes,

01:40.934 --> 01:42.267
<i>Jack Bauer is dead.</i>

01:42.334 --> 01:43.934
JACK:
<i>I understand that, sir.</i>

01:44.000 --> 01:47.367
<i>Mr. President,</i>
<i>it's been an honor.</i>

02:10.767 --> 02:14.801
Jim Nichols!
You're on pump number one.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.467
Sterling Rush, Patrick Priest.

02:17.534 --> 02:19.868
You're on pump
number four.

02:19.934 --> 02:22.868
Phil Stone,
Greg Nelson,

02:22.934 --> 02:25.000
you're on pump five.

02:25.067 --> 02:29.334
Sorry, guys, that's
all I got today.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.200
Hey, Frank?

02:36.267 --> 02:37.267
Look, I-I know
I promised

02:37.334 --> 02:38.300
you work today,
but...

02:38.367 --> 02:40.067
pump seven went
off-line last night.

02:40.133 --> 02:41.601
That's all right.
I'll try again tomorrow.

02:41.667 --> 02:43.801
Yeah, tomorrow'll
be much better.

02:43.868 --> 02:45.133
See you tomorrow.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.234
ANCHORMAN:
<i>The sun is shining,</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:57.968
but the air is cool
at President Logan's retreat,

02:58.033 --> 03:00.200
where Russian President
Yuri Suvarov

03:00.267 --> 03:02.300
is expected to arrive
later this morning.

03:02.367 --> 03:05.200
Everything worked for me,
up until the chapter

03:05.267 --> 03:06.601
on your first campaign.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.601
I'm sorry, but I think
it's a little long-winded,

03:08.667 --> 03:10.200
and I think that we can
cut that down by half.

03:17.934 --> 03:20.434
You didn't hear a word
I just said, did you?

03:21.501 --> 03:22.601
Yes, I was listening.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.100
No, you weren't.

03:25.234 --> 03:27.667
You're right.

03:27.734 --> 03:29.467
I'm sorry.

03:29.534 --> 03:30.901
Are you okay?

03:30.968 --> 03:33.300
I can use a break.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.634
What's going on?

03:38.701 --> 03:39.901
What do you mean?

03:39.968 --> 03:41.400
I mean you've
been distracted

03:41.467 --> 03:43.434
ever since you
got to Los Angeles.

03:43.501 --> 03:45.267
I don't know, it's...

03:45.334 --> 03:46.934
It's like you're
somewhere else.

03:48.601 --> 03:52.834
Writing my memoirs...

03:52.901 --> 03:55.801
maybe it's put me in
a melancholy mood.

03:55.868 --> 03:58.467
Is that all it is?

03:58.534 --> 04:00.968
Yeah.

04:03.567 --> 04:06.767
David... I'm
your brother.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.667
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

04:13.100 --> 04:16.100
It's all right, really.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.434
Okay.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.132
Well, then let's

04:20.200 --> 04:22.167
get back to work.

04:22.234 --> 04:24.400
One more chapter,
and we'll take a break.

04:24.467 --> 04:28.000
Why don't we jump down
to, um, Chapter Six?

04:28.067 --> 04:29.367
There's going to be
a lot of questions

04:29.434 --> 04:30.801
about your relationship
with Sherry.

04:36.701 --> 04:37.701
David!

04:39.234 --> 04:41.234
No, no, no, no, no...

04:41.300 --> 04:43.067
Get help!

04:43.133 --> 04:45.300
Stay with me.

04:45.367 --> 04:47.267
Stay with me!
<i>Get help!</i>

04:56.267 --> 04:58.033
Walt.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.067
My chair?

04:59.133 --> 05:00.167
Don't worry,
Mr. President.

05:00.234 --> 05:01.567
I had it adjusted.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.033
Good.
Adjusted?
Wait a minute.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.367
What are we talking
about here?

05:04.434 --> 05:05.934
Yuri Suvarov is
over six feet.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.601
Russian President can't be
looking down on the President

05:07.667 --> 05:09.434
of the United States
when the cameras roll.

05:09.501 --> 05:11.000
That's a risky
proposition, Walt.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.200
The press finds out
about it, and...

05:12.267 --> 05:14.033
They won't.

05:14.100 --> 05:17.434
Don't underestimate the power
of the image, Mike.

05:17.501 --> 05:19.133
Stalin and Churchill,
they both sat

05:19.200 --> 05:20.601
for FDR at Yalta.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.834
This is the defining moment
of my administration.

05:22.901 --> 05:24.501
We have to make sure
that the media

05:24.567 --> 05:25.968
presents it the right way.

05:26.033 --> 05:28.801
( <i>phone rings</i> )
I'll get it.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.534
Yeah, put
him through.

05:32.601 --> 05:34.400
Have you checked on my wife?

05:34.467 --> 05:36.133
Ah, she's still
getting ready.

05:37.367 --> 05:38.767
She'll be fine, sir.

05:38.834 --> 05:39.767
Hmm.

05:39.834 --> 05:42.267
I'm in contact with Dr. Hill.

05:42.334 --> 05:46.334
I'd feel better if you would
check on her yourself.

05:47.834 --> 05:49.567
She cannot have
one of her meltdowns today.

05:49.634 --> 05:52.467
Look...

05:52.534 --> 05:54.234
you're the only one
she listens to, Walt.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.300
Yes, sir.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.400
Thank you.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.567
Mike?

06:04.634 --> 06:06.901
Mike, what is it?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.334
David Palmer's
been assassinated.

06:13.334 --> 06:15.133
What?!

06:15.200 --> 06:16.901
It just happened.

06:16.968 --> 06:19.868
Oh, my God.

06:19.934 --> 06:21.267
Where?

06:21.334 --> 06:22.467
In L.A.

06:24.701 --> 06:26.868
I don't believe this.

06:28.567 --> 06:31.667
Mr. President, uh, CTU is
standing by

06:31.734 --> 06:33.934
to brief you directly.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.868
Whenever you're ready.

06:55.501 --> 06:57.701
Make sure LAPD sets up
a hard perimeter.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.100
They're sending everyone
they've got.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.634
Where are they
on witnesses?
Nowhere yet.

07:00.701 --> 07:01.801
Who's running search
and sweep?

07:01.868 --> 07:03.634
Secret Service, but
they're shorthanded.

07:03.701 --> 07:04.701
Narrow the search area.

07:04.767 --> 07:05.868
Make sure ballistics runs

07:05.934 --> 07:07.200
a line-of-fire
trajectory.

07:07.267 --> 07:09.300
Sir, President Logan's ready.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.501
I'll call ballistics.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.200
Put the President through.

07:19.334 --> 07:21.133
Mr. President.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.467
Bill... not to diminish

07:24.534 --> 07:25.968
the loss that we're all
feeling right now,

07:26.033 --> 07:28.934
but I'm expecting the Russian
President very soon, so...

07:29.000 --> 07:31.100
let's say what needs to be said.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.133
Of course, sir.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.868
Have you arrested
the person who did this?

07:34.934 --> 07:36.200
Not yet, sir.

07:36.267 --> 07:37.868
Then what do you have?

07:37.934 --> 07:39.434
Sir, the damage inflicted

07:39.501 --> 07:42.300
by the single shot indicates
that President Palmer was hit

07:42.367 --> 07:45.467
by a 308-caliber bullet
fired from an adjacent building.

07:45.534 --> 07:48.033
We've initiated an interagency
protocol, level five...

07:48.100 --> 07:51.200
Don't... don't give me
protocols, Bill.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.601
Give me results.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.634
Whoever did this, I want them
dead or in custody

07:54.701 --> 07:55.901
by the time
the Russians get here.

07:55.968 --> 07:57.367
Yes, Mr. President.

07:57.434 --> 07:57.601
But until we know more,
I would ask that you consider

08:00.300 --> 08:01.601
postponing the signing
of the treaty, sir.

08:01.667 --> 08:05.033
No. Absolutely not.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.834
Mr. President, we can't
discount the possibility

08:07.901 --> 08:10.067
that this attack
is somehow connected

08:10.133 --> 08:11.133
to the arms agreement.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.501
A former president

08:12.567 --> 08:14.434
was assassinated 15 miles
from where you are.

08:14.501 --> 08:16.267
And I'm sure
I don't need to explain

08:16.334 --> 08:17.834
the significance of this day.

08:17.901 --> 08:20.367
Do you realize what kind of
political and economic capital

08:20.434 --> 08:23.400
I've spent just to get
the Russians to the table?

08:23.467 --> 08:27.100
If we call this off,
they won't come back.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.634
Spencer?

08:40.534 --> 08:41.701
Spencer!

08:41.767 --> 08:43.299
What?

08:43.366 --> 08:45.100
Get out of my bed.

08:45.167 --> 08:47.133
Yeah.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.701
I had a good time
last night, too.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.400
I'm serious.
This was a mistake.

08:50.467 --> 08:52.534
Get out of here.

08:52.601 --> 08:54.067
What do you mean, a mistake?

08:54.133 --> 08:55.334
We had a great time.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.400
I don't get involved with people
who work for me.

08:59.467 --> 09:00.901
It's too late for that.

09:00.968 --> 09:02.968
I would appreciate it
if you didn't tell

09:03.033 --> 09:04.467
everybody at work about this.

09:04.534 --> 09:06.634
I don't want everyone thinking
I'm some kind of slut.

09:06.701 --> 09:10.300
Believe me, no one's ever going
to think that.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.167
What's that supposed to mean?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.434
You should lighten up, you know?

09:20.501 --> 09:22.501
You'll live longer.

09:25.367 --> 09:27.467
What are you doing?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.667
When you quit overanalyzing
the situation,

09:29.734 --> 09:31.334
I think you're
gonna find out

09:31.400 --> 09:33.367
that you and I are
pretty good together.

09:33.434 --> 09:36.334
So I'm telling you
advce, yes.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.501
Yes, what?

09:38.567 --> 09:41.033
I'll let you buy me dinner.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.767
Get me drunk.
Have your way with me.

09:42.834 --> 09:45.300
Anytime you want.

09:45.367 --> 09:48.033
You know, um, arrogance
doesn't turn me on.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.234
I've read that some
women respond to it,

09:50.300 --> 09:52.934
but I'm just letting
you know, I don't.

10:16.934 --> 10:18.133
What is it?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.300
President Palmer's been shot.

10:21.601 --> 10:24.467
He's dead.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.934
REPORTER:
While it remains unclear
how the assassination

10:31.000 --> 10:32.767
will impact today's
scheduled signing

10:32.834 --> 10:34.300
of the arms treaty with Russia,

10:34.367 --> 10:37.567
President Logan is expected
to make a statement shortly.

10:37.634 --> 10:40.534
Again, if you are
just joining us,

10:40.601 --> 10:44.100
former President David Palmer
has been assassinated.

10:44.167 --> 10:46.501
We're going to take
a few moments now to look

10:46.567 --> 10:49.000
at the former president's
great achievements.

11:01.367 --> 11:02.400
Who is it?

11:02.467 --> 11:04.701
WOMAN:
It's me, Frank.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.534
Hey.
Hey.

11:10.601 --> 11:11.801
I saw your truck outside.

11:11.868 --> 11:13.033
I thought you
were on today.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.634
Oh, Ned didn't
need me this morning.

11:14.701 --> 11:16.801
Hmm.

11:16.868 --> 11:19.167
It's so terrible,
what happened.

11:22.534 --> 11:25.200
Are you okay?

11:25.267 --> 11:27.667
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:27.734 --> 11:29.801
Come on, I'm
making breakfast.

11:29.868 --> 11:31.234
Okay.

11:39.801 --> 11:40.834
Frank's gonna
join us.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.868
Great.

11:42.934 --> 11:44.367
Derek, stop it.

11:48.734 --> 11:50.934
Morning.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.200
Morning.

11:52.267 --> 11:54.367
Use a glass, please.

11:57.434 --> 11:58.567
Here.

12:08.767 --> 12:09.934
Excuse me.

12:11.868 --> 12:13.167
Can I ask you something, Frank?

12:13.234 --> 12:15.434
Yeah, sure.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.567
That rig in Alaska you worked
on, what was that called again?

12:18.634 --> 12:21.167
The Albatross.

12:21.234 --> 12:23.767
And you were thereast year?

12:23.834 --> 12:26.334
Yeah, why?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.334
It's funny.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.667
My friend's got a brother

12:28.734 --> 12:30.501
who's been working
on that rig for five years

12:30.567 --> 12:32.234
and he's never heard
of any Frank Flynn.

12:33.501 --> 12:36.234
It's a big platform.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.133
Yeah, well, my friend's brother
says everyone knows everyone.

12:39.601 --> 12:40.834
What is this, an interrogation?

12:40.901 --> 12:43.501
I just don't like being lied to.

12:43.567 --> 12:44.467
Derek.

12:44.534 --> 12:46.501
No, it's all right.

12:46.567 --> 12:49.267
No one's lying to you, Derek.

12:51.767 --> 12:54.467
When you're out there, a lot
of the guys just use nicknames.

12:54.534 --> 12:56.367
DIANE:
Yeah.

12:56.434 --> 13:00.000
What's your friend's
brother's name?

13:02.501 --> 13:04.467
Eat your breakfast.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.033
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

13:13.934 --> 13:15.200
Sorry.

13:15.267 --> 13:17.200
He's just kind of
protective of me.

13:17.267 --> 13:18.567
But it's the best thing

13:18.634 --> 13:20.734
in the world for him
to have a man around here.

13:22.901 --> 13:24.901
Look, what he said about me
and Alaska...

13:24.968 --> 13:27.267
You don't owe me an explanation.

13:27.334 --> 13:30.133
I figure if you had wanted
l me about your past

13:30.200 --> 13:31.934
you would have
told me already.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.968
I trust my instincts.

13:34.033 --> 13:36.400
And I trust you.

13:39.167 --> 13:40.434
Former President David Palmer

13:40.501 --> 13:42.601
was killed
just a short while ago.

13:42.667 --> 13:43.868
Now, no information

13:43.934 --> 13:45.968
has been released to the public
athis time,

13:46.033 --> 13:47.567
but an independent source
has verified

13:47.634 --> 13:49.667
that Palmer was in Los Angeles

13:49.734 --> 13:51.501
visiting his brother
and former White...

13:51.567 --> 13:53.834
Bill will call if he
needs us, you know that.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.434
No, he won't.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.000
Authorities are remaining
very tightlipped

13:57.067 --> 13:59.868
as the LAPD and Secret Service
seal off the area,

13:59.934 --> 14:03.033
and there has been no word on
whether this was an accident...

14:03.100 --> 14:04.300
It's not our job.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.934
Not anymore.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.467
This is different.

14:07.534 --> 14:09.367
Come on, Michelle.

14:09.434 --> 14:10.734
I'm just as upset
as you are.

14:10.801 --> 14:12.300
David Palmer meant
a lot to me, too.

14:12.367 --> 14:14.567
But there are other people
at CTU who can handle this.

14:14.634 --> 14:15.667
No one who was active

14:15.734 --> 14:17.934
during the other attempts
onis life.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.767
Tony, you and I worked up
suspect profiles.

14:20.834 --> 14:21.901
We ran scenarios.

14:21.968 --> 14:23.667
And theyAneth
our records on file.

14:23.734 --> 14:25.434
They don't have
our experience.

14:27.067 --> 14:31.534
I never once regretted
our decision to leave CTU.

14:31.601 --> 14:33.334
But I don't want
to look back

14:33.400 --> 14:35.868
on today and realize
I could have helped.

14:42.968 --> 14:44.601
We're running a business here,
Michelle.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.701
Rick Rosen is expecting us
to make a presentation

14:46.767 --> 14:47.934
in less than an hour.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.767
You can handle the meeting
on your own.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.200
Michelle, don't do this.

15:15.968 --> 15:18.434
It's Rick.
Leave me a message.

15:18.501 --> 15:19.934
Yeah, Rick, it's Tony Almeida.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.701
Look, I just wanted to call you
and let you know

15:21.767 --> 15:23.934
that Michelle's not gonna be
able to make our meeting today.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.367
She had to go someplace.

15:26.434 --> 15:30.067
On second thought...

15:30.133 --> 15:31.501
I'm going with her.

16:12.034 --> 16:14.401
Did Jepson brief you
on what's happening?

16:14.468 --> 16:16.234
Said there was
a car bombing.

16:16.301 --> 16:17.800
Two former CTU agents were hit.

16:17.867 --> 16:20.401
Yeah, their names are Michelle
Dessler and Tony Almeida.

16:20.468 --> 16:22.533
You knew them?

16:22.600 --> 16:23.967
Yeah.

16:24.034 --> 16:26.167
We're data-mining
for a connection

16:26.234 --> 16:28.101
between them
and President Palmer.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.533
I sent the parameters
to your screen.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.434
I'll get on it.

16:39.101 --> 16:40.267
Yeah?

16:40.334 --> 16:41.800
It's Edgar. Are you coming in?

16:41.867 --> 16:44.001
, I just, I  paged
on a level five protocol,

16:44.067 --> 16:45.401
X
of crse I'm coming in.

16:45.468 --> 16:47.700
I wanted to give you aveeads up
before you got here.

16:47.767 --> 16:48.700
Heads up?

16:48.767 --> 16:50.567
It's bad, Chloe.

16:50.633 --> 16:52.267
Yeah, President Palmer
was gunned down.

16:52.334 --> 16:53.468
I'd say that's pretty bad.

16:53.533 --> 16:55.134
It's not just him.

16:55.201 --> 16:56.600
What are you talking about?

16:56.667 --> 17:00.633
Someone planted a bomb in
Michelle Dessler's car.

17:00.700 --> 17:03.034
What?

17:03.101 --> 17:04.834
Michelle's dead.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.633
He
Tony's not doing too good.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.834
Doesn't make any sense.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.434
They were retired.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.101
Buchanan thinks it's lind
to Palmer somehow.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.067
We're cross-referencing
everything we have on Palmer

17:14.134 --> 17:16.700
with Tony and Michelle, to see
if we can find a connection,

17:16.767 --> 17:20.934
anything they may
have had in common.

17:21.001 --> 17:23.800
Chloe?

17:23.867 --> 17:26.267
Go.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.800
Chloe?
I'll call you back.

17:28.867 --> 17:30.700
I'll call you back!
Why? Chloe?

18:25.667 --> 18:27.533
Since I don't have
to go to work today,

18:27.600 --> 18:30.101
I can take care of the fence
out back if you want.wa

18:30.167 --> 18:30.301
Oh, that'd be great.

18:31.167 --> 18:32.267
I can't thank you enough

18:32.334 --> 18:34.001
for all the work
you've down around here.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.368
It's t least
I could do.

18:35.434 --> 18:37.001
Excuse me.

18:38.067 --> 18:39.134
Yeah?

18:39.201 --> 18:40.867
Jack, I know
this isn't protocol.

18:40.934 --> 18:43.101
Please don't hang up on me.
I need your help.

18:43.167 --> 18:46.334
Uh, hold on,
I can barely hear you.

18:46.401 --> 18:48.368
I don't have a very
good signal.

18:48.434 --> 18:50.800
Excuse me.

18:56.334 --> 18:57.934
What is it?

18:58.001 --> 18:59.700
They got Tony and Michelle.
Michelle is dead.

18:59.767 --> 19:00.834
Tony is in critical
condition.

19:00.900 --> 19:01.967
Now they're gonna
kill me.

19:02.034 --> 19:03.234
What are you
talking about?

19:03.301 --> 19:04.867
There's four people
that know you're alive.

19:04.934 --> 19:06.900
Three of them are down.
Jack, I'm the only one left.

19:06.967 --> 19:08.334
This has to be about you.

19:08.401 --> 19:10.201
It's the only thing the four
of us have in common.

19:10.267 --> 19:12.101
What happened
to Tony tod Michelle.

19:12.167 --> 19:13.633
There was a car bomb.

19:13.700 --> 19:16.434
X
There was a guy outside my
apartment and he was chasing me.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.234
Oh, my God.

19:18.301 --> 19:19.401
Where is he now?

19:19.468 --> 19:20.633
I think I lost him.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.767
I'm at a pay phone.
I dumped my cell phone.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.267
I don't know
what to do now.

19:24.334 --> 19:26.101
Chloe, you need to go dark.

19:26.167 --> 19:28.900
That means zero contact
with anyone.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.001
Even CTU?

19:30.067 --> 19:31.334
Especially CTU.

19:31.401 --> 19:34.234
Whoever's behind this
is probably monitori them.

19:34.301 --> 19:37.201
Someone out ther
knows I'm still alive.
Who?

19:37.267 --> 19:40.001
I don't know, but that's
what we need to find out.

19:40.067 --> 19:43.001
Right now, I want you to head
north out of Los Angeles.

19:43.067 --> 19:45.334
There's  abandoned oil
refinery at Variel and Topanga.

19:45.368 --> 19:46.533
I want you to wait
for me there

19:46.600 --> 19:47.934
You can take cover

19:48.001 --> 19:50.267
by the large storage tanks
at the north end of the field.

19:50.334 --> 19:51.334
You're coming to L.A.?

19:51.401 --> 19:53.134
Give me about
a half an ho.

19:53.201 --> 19:55.301
Okay. Thanks.

20:12.967 --> 20:15.567
Tony Almeida
is being medevaced in.

20:15.633 --> 20:18.401
We have a trauma team standing
by to receive him in medical.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.700
You're bringing him
to CTU?

20:19.767 --> 20:21.600
If there's a second
attempt on his life,

20:21.667 --> 20:23.368
we can't protect him
in a hospital.

20:23.434 --> 20:24.900
This doesn't track.

20:24.967 --> 20:26.900
Michelle and Tony have been
inactive for over a year.

20:26.967 --> 20:27.900
Who'd want them dead?

20:27.967 --> 20:29.500
Whoever wanted Palmer dead.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.500
So we're assuming
they're connected.

20:31.567 --> 20:32.967
The timing
was too close

20:33.034 --> 20:34.633
to write it off
as a coincidence.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.234
There is a connection.

20:36.301 --> 20:38.468
Let's find it.

20:38.533 --> 20:40.567
Sir, the DOD liaison is here.

20:40.633 --> 20:41.934
I need to set her up

20:42.001 --> 20:43.734
with the security
protocols for the summit.

20:43.800 --> 20:44.967
I'll take care of it.

20:45.034 --> 20:46.134
You have your assignments.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.934
Send updates
directly to my screen.

20:48.001 --> 20:49.234
Where is she?

20:49.301 --> 20:50.767
She just cleared security.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.934
Thank you.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.368
Audrey.
Bill.

21:10.434 --> 21:12.533
Must be hard for you
to be back here.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.600
Thank you, Bill. I'm fine.

21:14.667 --> 21:18.667
I'm sorry
about Michelle.

21:20.234 --> 21:22.134
Walt Cummings briefed me
on the way over here.

21:22.201 --> 21:23.667
He said that you
wanted to postpone

21:23.734 --> 21:24.867
the signing of
the treaty.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.201
President Logan
is making a mistake.

21:26.267 --> 21:28.834
I don't disagree.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.234
Have you let him
know that?

21:30.301 --> 21:32.633
He's the President, Bill.
It's his call.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.001
That's what
I'm afraid of.

21:35.067 --> 21:36.600
He wants me to make sure

21:36.667 --> 21:39.101
that your top priority is still
security for the summit.

21:41.201 --> 21:42.867
Station Five is set up for you.

21:42.934 --> 21:45.334
When you're situated,
we'll go over the revised

21:45.401 --> 21:46.334
security protocol.

21:46.401 --> 21:47.600
Great.
Thank you, Bill.

21:51.468 --> 21:56.067
David Palmer was a man
of truth and of honor.

21:56.134 --> 21:59.301
And his influence will be felt
for generations to come.

21:59.368 --> 22:02.567
Our nation grieves
for its loss.

22:02.633 --> 22:06.001
Martha and I offer
our deepest sympathy.

22:09.967 --> 22:11.867
You look beautiful,
Mrs. Logan.

22:15.201 --> 22:19.434
I look like a wedding cake.

22:24.167 --> 22:26.368
Les start over.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.134
Oh, you can get that.

22:46.934 --> 22:48.533
Is Mrs. Logan ready?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.134
Not quite.

22:50.201 --> 22:52.500
You didn't tell her
about David Palmer?

22:52.567 --> 22:55.067
No.
Thank you.

22:55.134 --> 22:56.967
She'll take it hard
when she finds out.

22:57.034 --> 22:58.600
They've been friends
for a long time.

22:58.667 --> 23:02.201
You don't have to talk
about me like I'm not here.

23:02.267 --> 23:03.934
Excuse us, Evelyn.

23:13.301 --> 23:16.067
Martha...

23:16.134 --> 23:17.500
I... I'm sorry.

23:17.567 --> 23:19.468
Look, I know... I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.

23:19.533 --> 23:21.401
I just... I'm having
a bad hair day.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.134
Martha...

23:23.201 --> 23:26.034
I've got som
very bad news.

23:27.067 --> 23:29.700
But... it's not Charles,
is it?

23:29.767 --> 23:31.368
No. No, he's fine.

23:31.434 --> 23:35.134
He wanted to tell
you himself...

23:35.201 --> 23:36.500
Well... what?

23:37.533 --> 23:40.401
Walt, Walt...

23:40.468 --> 23:43.734
well, what... what is it?

23:47.401 --> 23:49.301
David Palmer
was assassinated.

23:52.734 --> 23:54.334
No...

24:02.434 --> 24:04.034
I'm sorry.

24:08.401 --> 24:10.101
I know how close
you were.

24:10.167 --> 24:11.734
When did this happen?

24:11.800 --> 24:13.900
Less than an hour ago.

24:13.967 --> 24:15.767
This morning?!

24:17.167 --> 24:19.001
I...

24:26.634 --> 24:30.834
I... I have to talk to Charles.

24:30.901 --> 24:32.767
He's doing damage control,
trying to keep this

24:32.834 --> 24:34.268
om pushing the treaty
off the front page.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.734
No, no, oh, no, I have
to talk to him now.

24:35.801 --> 24:37.134
No. He's doing a
press conference...
No!

24:37.201 --> 24:38.134
Martha!

24:38.201 --> 24:40.067
Martha!

24:41.067 --> 24:43.168
Agent North!

24:43.234 --> 24:45.134
Call John, tell him
not to let Mrs. Logan

24:45.201 --> 24:47.534
anywhere near the stage.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.201
Yeah, give me Dr. Hill.

24:49.268 --> 24:51.734
As I look back upon the deeds
of David Palmer--

24:51.801 --> 24:54.467
not only one of this country's
greatest leaders,

24:54.534 --> 24:56.801
but one of this world's
greatest men...

25:01.101 --> 25:03.034
Our nation grieves
for its loss...

25:03.101 --> 25:05.234
Mrs. Logan...
Let go of me.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.101
Let go of me! Let go!
I can't let you...

25:07.168 --> 25:08.867
...to President Palmer's
entire family.

away from me?

And to them, I also pledge
the full resources

25:14.034 --> 25:17.400

No, no, no.
Get aw from me.

I can't let you go out there.
Don't-don't touch me.

25:23.767 --> 25:24.700
Don't touch me.

25:24.767 --> 25:26.333
Get away from me
now, or I swear

25:26.400 --> 25:28.567
I will have your family
eating dog food out of a can.

25:28.634 --> 25:29.700
Martha, stop it!

25:29.767 --> 25:31.367
Mike, damn it, I
am the First Lady!

Tell your storm trooper
to stay away from me!

25:34.001 --> 25:34.934
CUMMINGS:
Certainly.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.567
I need to talk

25:37.634 --> 25:40.201
Martha, look... he's in the
middle of a press conference

25:40.268 --> 25:42.034
right now.

25:42.101 --> 25:43.367

What is it, Martha?

25:49.433 --> 25:51.567
What is so urgent?

LOGAN:
...I have decided to keep
my scheduled meeting

25:53.867 --> 25:55.534

Maybe I can help.

25:57.101 --> 25:58.300
LOGAN:
Yuri Suvarov and I will sign

25:58.367 --> 26:00.834
a comprehensive treaty
that promises

26:00.901 --> 26:02.333
a new level of cooperation

26:02.400 --> 26:07.201
between us and our Russian
friends in the war on terror.

26:07.268 --> 26:10.801
Tell Charles I want to
see him when he's done.

27:09.367 --> 27:10.868
Don't shoot me.

27:10.934 --> 27:12.434
What the hell
are you doing here?

27:12.501 --> 27:13.734
I'm sorry I followed you.

27:13.801 --> 27:16.200
I'm just... I'm just worried
about my mother.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.467
Get up.

27:19.534 --> 27:21.767
Get up. Get up!

27:21.834 --> 27:23.267
Damn it!

27:23.334 --> 27:24.934
Come here.
You're going with me.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
This is none
of my business.

27:26.067 --> 27:26.901
This is none of
my business.

27:26.968 --> 27:28.434
I won't tell anyone.

27:28.501 --> 27:30.167
Just let me go, okay?

27:31.234 --> 27:32.934
I really wish
I could, kid,

27:33.000 --> 27:34.067
but I can't.

27:34.133 --> 27:35.267
You're going with me.

27:35.334 --> 27:36.234
Now get in the helicopter.

27:36.300 --> 27:39.467
Frank, Frank,
come on, please.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.167
Get into the helicopter.
Move!

27:55.067 --> 27:57.067
BESSON:
Prep a sterile
cranial field.

27:57.133 --> 28:00.133
I need access to the
right hemisphere.

28:04.567 --> 28:05.801
I need to talk to Tony

28:05.868 --> 28:07.167
before he goes
into surgery.

28:07.234 --> 28:08.567
He's non-responsive.

28:08.634 --> 28:09.834
According to the paramedic

28:09.901 --> 28:11.501
on the chopper, he suffered
a closed head trauma

28:11.567 --> 28:12.868
that's affected
his speech.

28:12.934 --> 28:14.367
They're going to try
to insert a stint

28:14.434 --> 28:15.734
to relieve the pressure.

28:15.801 --> 28:17.000
Will he be able
to talk then?

28:17.067 --> 28:19.067
The doctor doesn't know.

28:19.133 --> 28:21.467
I want real time updates
on his progress.

28:22.567 --> 28:23.834
We need Tony to
explain this.

28:24.901 --> 28:25.834
What is it?

28:25.901 --> 28:26.834
I may have found
a connection

28:26.901 --> 28:28.300
between Tony and
David Palmer.

28:28.367 --> 28:29.300
Tony's phone records?

28:29.367 --> 28:30.534
One call in particular.

28:30.601 --> 28:32.200
The last time Tony spoke
to President Palmer

28:32.267 --> 28:33.667
was the day
that Jack Bauer was killed.

28:35.601 --> 28:37.267
Pull the transcripts?

28:37.334 --> 28:39.334
I tried, but the files
were corrupted.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.834
What's he hiding?

28:42.901 --> 28:45.000
Something about Jack's death.

28:48.834 --> 28:50.167
DEREK:
<i>Are you kidnapping me?</i>

28:50.234 --> 28:51.734
No!

28:51.801 --> 28:53.133
Then where are you taking me?

28:53.200 --> 28:54.667
Los Angeles.

28:54.734 --> 28:55.868
Why?

28:55.934 --> 28:57.834
Because I couldn't
leave you back there.

28:57.901 --> 29:00.067
You'd have gone to the police,
and I couldn't let that happen.

29:00.167 --> 29:01.601
But what is this about?

29:01.667 --> 29:02.934
Who are you?

29:03.000 --> 29:06.367
Someone who's not supposed
to still be alive.

29:06.434 --> 29:08.834
Like some kind
of witness relocation thg?

29:08.901 --> 29:10.567
Yeah, mething lith that.

29:10.634 --> 29:12.467
So you were a criminal.

29:12.534 --> 29:15.934
No. Listen, Dere the less
you know about me, the better.

29:17.167 --> 29:19.033
So what are you going
to do with me?

29:22.234 --> 29:23.167
DIANE:
Hello?

29:23.234 --> 29:24.867
Diane, it's me.

29:24.934 --> 29:26.367
Frank, I can
just barely hear you.

29:26.434 --> 29:27.367
What's that noise?

29:27.434 --> 29:29.167
I'm in a helicopter with Derek.

29:29.234 --> 29:30.201
Derek?

29:30.267 --> 29:31.334
Yeah. He's fine.

29:31.401 --> 29:32.600
Listen, Diane, I need you

29:32.667 --> 29:34.067
to pick him up
hiin Los Angeles for me.

29:34.134 --> 29:35.301
Why is he with you?

29:35.367 --> 29:37.201
I'll explain everything
as soon as I see you.

29:37.267 --> 29:39.700
Frank, Frank,
what are you doing with Derek?

29:39.767 --> 29:41.000
Diane, please
just do this for me.

29:41.067 --> 29:42.234
I need you to get in a car a

29:42.301 --> 29:43.501
and start driving now.

29:43.568 --> 29:44.934
You're scaring me.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.234
Heane, do you remember
this morning,

29:46.301 --> 29:47.867
when you said
that you trusted me?

29:47.934 --> 29:50.401
Right now, I need you
to trust me.

29:50.468 --> 29:52.733
Derek's going to be fine.
Just do what I say.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.034
I need you to get in a car

29:54.101 --> 29:55.568
and start driving
towards Los Angeles.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.101
Don't talk to anybody
about this.

29:57.167 --> 29:59.568
And I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

29:59.633 --> 30:01.334
Frank?

30:04.667 --> 30:05.967
I don't understand.

30:06.067 --> 30:08.134
You're just going to
hand me back to my mom?

30:08.201 --> 30:10.401
I thought you were worried
about me going to the police.

30:10.468 --> 30:12.167
I have something to do
in Los Angeles.

30:12.234 --> 30:14.367
Once it's done,
it doesn't matter.

30:32.367 --> 30:33.600
FO
How are you doing?

30:33.667 --> 30:35.733
I'm sorry, Charles.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.767
I didn't mean
to make a scene.

30:37.834 --> 30:39.067
I know that.

30:40.834 --> 30:42.934
Dr. Hill says you haven't
been taking your medication.

30:44.134 --> 30:46.568
I don't like the way
the pills make me feel.

30:46.633 --> 30:49.434
Martie...

30:49.501 --> 30:51.401
we just need to
get through today.

30:51.468 --> 30:53.401
Charles...

30:53.468 --> 30:55.867
the reason that I needed to...

30:55.934 --> 30:57.134
eded to talk to you...

30:57.201 --> 30:58.134
What is it, honey?

30:58.201 --> 31:00.167
Go ahead.

31:00.234 --> 31:03.367
I think...
that David was killed

31:03.434 --> 31:05.834
because of something
he was about to tell me.

31:11.934 --> 31:13.700
What are you talkiou aal?

31:13.767 --> 31:15.367
He called me
yesterday.

31:15.434 --> 31:17.633
He said he wanted
to meet with me.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.367
Meet with you about what?

31:19.434 --> 31:21.201
He said it concerned
national security,

31:21.267 --> 31:23.234
and that it involved you.

31:23.301 --> 31:25.367
Me?
Yes.

31:25.434 --> 31:26.900
What else did he say?

31:26.967 --> 31:29.534
Just that he would explain
when he saw me.

31:30.568 --> 31:32.700
If this was so important,

31:32.767 --> 31:34.733
why wouldn't he have
called me himself?

31:36.101 --> 31:38.534
Well, Charles, you shut him
out of this White House

31:38.600 --> 31:39.568
about 18 months ago.

31:39.633 --> 31:41.934
You know that.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.501
He had no real access.

31:44.633 --> 31:45.934
Except through you.

31:46.967 --> 31:48.000
You don't believe me.

31:48.067 --> 31:49.501
I didn't s that.

31:49.568 --> 31:51.667
You didn't need to.

31:51.733 --> 31:53.501
Martha...

31:53.568 --> 31:56.800
I am not
making this up.

31:56.867 --> 31:58.700
I am not crazy;
I am not a fool,

31:58.767 --> 32:00.167
Charles!
Martha...

32:00.234 --> 32:01.667
it's going to
be all right.

32:01.733 --> 32:05.867
I'm not making this up.

32:08.401 --> 32:10.267
All right.

32:10.334 --> 32:12.000
I'll have Walt look into it.

32:12.067 --> 32:13.600
You will?

32:13.667 --> 32:15.434
Yes.

32:15.501 --> 32:16.434
Thank you.

32:16.501 --> 32:19.267
But right now...

32:19.334 --> 32:22.401
President Suvarov and his wife
are arriving in one hour.

32:22.468 --> 32:26.201
I need you to be there.

32:26.267 --> 32:28.967
I need you by my side.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.834
I'm sorry.

32:42.067 --> 32:43.667
Thank you.

32:52.067 --> 32:53.700
Was she all right?

32:53.767 --> 32:55.167
No, Walt, she's
not all right.

32:55.234 --> 32:56.934
She's having another one
of her delusions.

32:58.201 --> 32:59.501
She thinks that David
Palmer was killed

32:59.568 --> 33:01.301
because of something he
was about to tell her.

33:01.367 --> 33:02.834
She's imagining

33:02.900 --> 33:05.401
she's in the middle of one
of her own conspiracy theories.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.733
Well, what should we do?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.234
Nothing.

33:27.101 --> 33:29.334
Spenser, have you talked
to Chloe this morning?

33:29.400 --> 33:30.800
No. Why?

33:30.867 --> 33:33.268
She left her apartment
about a half hour ago.

33:33.334 --> 33:35.034
She should've been here by now.

33:35.101 --> 33:36.567
It's probably traffic.

33:36.634 --> 33:37.934
She commutes
against traffic.

33:38.001 --> 33:39.600
And she's not answering
her cell phone.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.767
I wouldn't worry about it.

33:41.834 --> 33:43.634
She sounded strange
when I talked to her.

33:43.700 --> 33:46.234
She always sounds strange.

33:46.301 --> 33:49.301
I'm gonna call Adamson, have him
run a locate on her cell.

33:49.368 --> 33:51.600
Don't waste his time, Edgar.
She's fine.

33:51.667 --> 33:53.734
I'm sure of it.
What makes you so sure?

33:53.800 --> 33:55.600
It doesn't matter.
It does to me.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.901
I saw her, okay?

33:57.967 --> 34:00.001
Uh, about half an hour ago.

34:00.067 --> 34:01.001
But I thought you said...

34:01.067 --> 34:03.134
Forget what I said.

34:03.201 --> 34:05.700
Where did you see her?
Man...

34:05.767 --> 34:08.067
do you really need me
to spell it out for you?

34:11.368 --> 34:12.867
Don't worry about Chloe.

34:12.934 --> 34:14.533
She's fine, all right?

34:22.766 --> 34:24.333
You can just let me out here.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.667
There's nothing here.

34:25.734 --> 34:27.301
Just pull over, please.

34:37.034 --> 34:40.734

I still don't
understand what this
is all about, Frank.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.600
Will you please tell me
what's going on?

34:47.699 --> 34:50.134
Please?

34:50.201 --> 34:51.867
A friend of mine's
in trouble.

34:51.934 --> 34:53.934
I needed to pick her up
in a hurry.

34:54.001 --> 34:56.900
This is the only way
I could get to her quick enough.

Are you okay?
I'm fine!

35:49.734 --> 35:51.301
What's happening?
Why would anyone

35:51.368 --> 35:53.533
want to kill the people
who know you're alive?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.667
I don't know yet,
but we're gonna find out.

35:55.734 --> 35:58.533
Right now, I need to get access
to CTU's archives

35:58.600 --> 36:00.467
from a secure location--
can you help me do that?

36:00.533 --> 36:02.001
I can't do it
from my laptop.

36:02.067 --> 36:04.268
But there's a research
loft at Cal Tech.

36:04.334 --> 36:05.834
I can get us in.

36:05.901 --> 36:07.368
Who's that?

36:08.667 --> 36:10.600
I'll explain as soon
as we're in the car.

36:10.667 --> 36:12.533
I don't have a car.
I took a cab.

36:14.368 --> 36:17.034
Come on, get in
the helicopter.

36:59.268 --> 37:00.967
and stay by the side
of the helicopter!

37:21.167 --> 37:23.867
Here! Take him and go
into the refinery!

37:44.467 --> 37:46.534
Double back, cut him off.

37:48.034 --> 37:49.334
Go through the
smoke screen;
I'm going around.

39:26.034 --> 39:27.367
Hold your fire, Chloe!

39:40.667 --> 39:42.200
Jack, what are you doing?
Let's get out of here.

39:42.267 --> 39:44.034
Chloe, take Derek
and walk away.

39:44.100 --> 39:46.034
Walk away now!

39:58.901 --> 40:01.100
At the rate you're bleeding out,
you're not gonna make it

40:01.167 --> 40:02.534
unless you get
medical attention.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.001
You tell me
what I want to know,

40:04.068 --> 40:05.701
and I will get you
to a hospital,
you understand me?

40:07.300 --> 40:08.334
Do you understand me?

40:08.400 --> 40:09.834
Yeah.

40:09.901 --> 40:11.167
Four people knew I was alive.

40:11.233 --> 40:13.001
This morning,
you tried to take them out.

40:13.068 --> 40:14.734
Why are you
coming after me?

40:14.801 --> 40:17.534
Palmer was my...
primary target.

40:17.601 --> 40:19.434
They only cared
about Palmer.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.567
The others were just
a diversion...

40:21.634 --> 40:24.001
...to set you up,

40:24.068 --> 40:25.867
maket look
like you did it.

40:25.934 --> 40:28.001
Why'd they want
to kill Palmer?

40:28.068 --> 40:30.400
To keep him from talking.

40:30.467 --> 40:31.767
They had to
shut him up.

40:31.834 --> 40:32.968
What'd he know?

40:33.034 --> 40:35.334
HeI wasn't given
that information.

40:37.034 --> 40:39.834
Only hired...
to take out the principle.

40:43.667 --> 40:45.801
You're the one
that killed Palmer.

40:45.867 --> 40:48.034
Yeah.

41:05.567 --> 41:08.334
Who's behind this?

41:08.400 --> 41:10.100
Oh...

41:10.167 --> 41:13.367
I got my orders
through a code of silence.

41:13.434 --> 41:15.367
We never use names,
you know that.

41:15.434 --> 41:17.400
That's all I know.

41:17.467 --> 41:19.100
Take me to a hospital.

41:20.167 --> 41:22.367
Yeah.
