10:57.753 --> 10:59.153
our communication from the start,

10:59.155 --> 11:00.988
and they're using this old case
as their reference model.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.022
Why?

11:02.024 --> 11:04.458
Stall for time, keep us occupied.

11:04.460 --> 11:07.027
And to stop us from learning
what the kidnapper really wants.

11:07.029 --> 11:09.096
More pressing question is, who?

11:09.098 --> 11:11.098
Well, someone tech savvy enough
to be able to intercept

11:11.100 --> 11:13.334
Addison's e-mails in real time
without a trace.

11:13.336 --> 11:15.135
A hacker.

11:15.137 --> 11:17.739
With a lot invested in keeping a secret.

11:21.540 --> 11:24.378
So, if this is what we're seeing,

11:24.380 --> 11:25.679
what are they writing to the kidnapper?

11:25.681 --> 11:26.780
Exactly.

11:27.213 --> 11:28.749
We need to get
a direct line to them fast

11:28.751 --> 11:30.898
before Fraser gets caught
in the crossfire.

11:31.320 --> 11:35.289
Joe: I just got an answer back
from Voysec, and guess what?

11:35.291 --> 11:37.949
Addison Reid doesn't care about you.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.128
Read it.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.731
"We don't care. Go ahead and kill him.

11:43.733 --> 11:45.299
You can burn in hell!"

11:47.728 --> 11:49.503
Your life is worthless to her!

11:49.505 --> 11:50.604
[Tape rips]

11:50.606 --> 11:52.072
Just like mine was!

11:52.405 --> 11:54.842
No, Addison wouldn't write that.

11:55.446 --> 11:58.944
You still don't see her
for what she is, huh?

11:59.382 --> 12:00.814
No, please, don't.

12:00.816 --> 12:02.082
Look at me, Fraser.

12:02.084 --> 12:03.590
No.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.053
- Please.
- Look at me.

12:06.722 --> 12:08.555
Look at me.

12:16.917 --> 12:18.236
Joe.

12:28.971 --> 12:30.778
[Door closes]

12:44.226 --> 12:46.270
Who the hell are you?

12:49.770 --> 12:51.865
The door was open. I let myself in.

12:51.867 --> 12:53.701
I hope that's not a problem.

12:53.703 --> 12:56.036
You're Joe's roommate, right?

12:56.038 --> 12:57.938
My name's Rand Govender.

13:01.699 --> 13:03.510
Any idea where I might find him?

13:04.154 --> 13:06.213
You want to leave a number or something?

13:06.215 --> 13:09.116
Does he ever talk about Voysec Systems?

13:09.118 --> 13:12.186
How about Addison Reid? Ring a bell?

13:12.188 --> 13:13.387
No.

13:13.389 --> 13:15.188
Huh.

13:18.361 --> 13:20.027
Is this his room?

13:20.029 --> 13:22.630
Moved out in a hurry, did he?

13:22.632 --> 13:25.232
Looks like he's fallen
on some hard times.

13:26.636 --> 13:29.203
Was he working on
a little project in here?

13:31.207 --> 13:34.541
Meticulous researcher, our Joe.

13:36.787 --> 13:40.080
Hey, you're that guy Joe
was looking for, aren't you?

13:44.787 --> 13:48.402
I need to help Joe understand
that he's made a mistake.

13:49.187 --> 13:51.387
You're gonna tell me where he is.

14:01.488 --> 14:03.821
Voysec servers are state of the art.

14:03.823 --> 14:06.324
It wouldn't be easy hacking
Addison's e-mail.

14:06.326 --> 14:08.559
Unless you're someone
with high-level access.

14:08.561 --> 14:09.861
A CEO would have access.

14:09.863 --> 14:11.262
Why would Addison want to sabotage us

14:11.264 --> 14:12.664
from saving her number-one engineer?

14:12.666 --> 14:13.965
There's a good question.

14:13.967 --> 14:16.000
Come on. Addison's a visionary.

14:16.002 --> 14:18.603
Her tech saves over 20 lives per day.

14:18.605 --> 14:20.471
And those billionaire visionaries

14:20.473 --> 14:21.940
always play by the rules.

14:21.942 --> 14:23.942
Either way, we should assume
all her communications

14:23.944 --> 14:25.310
are compromised.

14:25.312 --> 14:29.814
The car used to kidnap Fraser is
registered to a Robin Grayson.

14:29.816 --> 14:32.050
She's 91, reported it stolen yesterday.

14:32.052 --> 14:33.484
Okay, go check it out.

14:33.486 --> 14:35.745
That could be our work around to
talk to the kidnapper directly.

14:36.389 --> 14:38.189
We need to show the CCTV

14:38.191 --> 14:40.325
of the car to Fraser's wife
and his co-worker.

14:40.327 --> 14:42.927
You don't really think they're
gonna recognize the car, do you?

14:42.929 --> 14:46.631
No, but it'll give us an excuse
to talk to them without Addison.

14:46.633 --> 14:49.634
[Ringing]

14:49.636 --> 14:51.286
Come on.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.778
Is that him? Is that who took Fraser?

14:56.182 --> 14:58.581
We believe so. Seen the car before?

14:58.583 --> 15:00.015
I don't think so.

15:00.017 --> 15:01.517
When the ransom video
came in this morning,

15:01.519 --> 15:03.076
what was the gossip?

15:04.222 --> 15:05.521
People must have been talking about it.

15:05.523 --> 15:08.090
Well, at... at first,
we thought it was a prank.

15:08.092 --> 15:09.736
Maya?

15:11.062 --> 15:13.762
Addison said it was corporate sabotage.

15:14.103 --> 15:15.264
Right,

15:15.598 --> 15:17.747
so she didn't give you
time to speculate?

15:19.036 --> 15:21.070
She didn't want us here, did she?

15:21.072 --> 15:23.339
You forwarded the video
to the insurance company,

15:23.341 --> 15:24.340
they called my team.

15:24.342 --> 15:26.335
Yeah, she said she'd handle it.

15:27.144 --> 15:29.046
Insurance company overruled her.

15:29.480 --> 15:33.143
That's why the kidnapper
sent it company-wide.

15:33.584 --> 15:36.318
He knew that Addison would
try to sweep it under the rug.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.220
Her whole thing about hiring the best,

15:38.222 --> 15:40.694
about sparing no expense.

15:42.079 --> 15:43.659
It was a lie.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.985
I'm sorry, Oliver.

15:51.469 --> 15:53.936
Your visionary
is sabotaging our negotiation.

15:53.938 --> 15:56.305
I can't believe Addison
would put Fraser in danger.

15:56.307 --> 15:59.241
She's definitely got something to hide.

15:59.243 --> 16:00.843
You think she's talking to that hacker

16:00.845 --> 16:02.645
that's intercepting our e-mails?

16:02.647 --> 16:03.646
I don't know.

16:03.648 --> 16:05.948
We need to get a better read on Addison.

16:05.950 --> 16:07.910
Show her some of our cards,

16:08.953 --> 16:11.086
see how she plays hers.

16:15.459 --> 16:16.558
Except for the video,

16:16.560 --> 16:18.127
we've had no contact with the kidnapper.

16:18.129 --> 16:20.095
Someone's been intercepting
our communication.

16:20.097 --> 16:21.597
Putting Fraser at huge risk.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.299
Why would anyone want to stop you

16:23.301 --> 16:24.900
from talking to the kidnappers?

16:24.902 --> 16:26.926
I thought you might be able to tell us.

16:27.925 --> 16:30.072
I have no idea.

16:30.074 --> 16:32.308
Unless it's our competitors stalling,

16:32.310 --> 16:35.110
trying to drag this out
past our launch deadline.

16:35.112 --> 16:37.146
Or somebody's afraid
a secret they're hiding

16:37.148 --> 16:39.682
will be exposed as part of the demands.

16:40.475 --> 16:41.817
What kind of secret?

16:43.667 --> 16:44.687
A shrug?

16:44.689 --> 16:48.028
A shrug doesn't help
get Fraser back, Mr. Beaumont.

16:49.445 --> 16:52.628
Find a direct line to the...
to the kidnapper.

16:52.947 --> 16:54.925
And do it quickly, please.

16:56.797 --> 16:59.168
Velocity, pitch, hesitation.

16:59.170 --> 17:02.538
All way in excess of
her normal speech pattern.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.117
Projecting anger.

17:05.214 --> 17:06.628
Classic bluff.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.750
Never meet your heroes.

17:10.114 --> 17:12.667
Oh, Zara and Maxine have got something.

you're standing there

17:25.730 --> 17:28.775

that his roommate was no help.

17:30.131 --> 17:33.102
Find me the GPS coordinates,
and I will find Joe.

17:33.104 --> 17:35.262
He'll slip up. When he does,
we've got him.

17:35.913 --> 17:38.874
Can we trust Addison
to keep her mouth shut?

17:38.876 --> 17:40.943
Yes, but not that hostage.

17:40.945 --> 17:43.579
Yeah, but she's counting on
getting him back, alive.

17:43.581 --> 17:44.913
You don't think she's gonna freak?

17:44.915 --> 17:47.249
We've got bigger problems than Addison.

17:47.251 --> 17:49.685
She said Beaumont knows the
e-mails are being intercepted.

17:49.687 --> 17:52.842
You seriously think I'm gonna
let them anywhere near us?

she reached full pension.

at Sing Sing, Damien Delaine...

18:04.435 --> 18:06.510
the guy that killed her mother
at Shiloh.

18:07.038 --> 18:08.570
What about the negotiator?

18:08.572 --> 18:10.172
Beaumont's non-existent online,

18:10.174 --> 18:13.375
but I found this on his psych expert.

18:13.377 --> 18:15.611
Seems like Mr. Yates has been making

18:15.613 --> 18:18.086
some illegal purchases on the Dark Web.

18:18.870 --> 18:20.249
By the time they clean up this mess,

18:20.251 --> 18:21.884
we'll have cleaned up ours.

18:26.822 --> 18:28.524
Maxine: The kidnapper
returned the stolen car

18:28.526 --> 18:29.591
without the owner seeing him,

18:29.593 --> 18:31.660
and he replaced the broken side mirror.

18:31.662 --> 18:33.395
Conscientious of him.

18:33.397 --> 18:35.564
We tracked down the salvage yard
that sold him the mirror.

18:35.566 --> 18:36.632
And he used a credit card?

18:36.634 --> 18:39.701
No, cash, but he did
the repair on the spot.

18:39.703 --> 18:42.071
We were able to pull a print
and hit the jackpot.

18:42.073 --> 18:44.973

18:44.975 --> 18:46.642
What's he in the system for?

18:46.644 --> 18:49.211
His wife took out
a restraining order against him.

18:49.644 --> 18:51.973
Why would she do a thing like that?

18:53.447 --> 18:56.585
I'm telling you, our life was good.

18:56.587 --> 18:58.157
Normal.

18:58.689 --> 19:01.090
Joe is a great husband and father,

19:01.092 --> 19:05.127
and then about a year ago,
it all began to fall apart.

19:05.129 --> 19:06.128
Joe changed?

19:06.130 --> 19:08.530
At first, it was little things.

19:08.532 --> 19:11.300
Uh, card declined at the grocery store,

19:13.571 --> 19:15.771
I mean, I wouldn't care really...

19:15.773 --> 19:17.940
But it was out of character?

19:17.942 --> 19:22.010
Yeah, and then he was accused
of embezzling money at work.

19:22.197 --> 19:24.012
I thought it had to be a mistake,

19:24.014 --> 19:26.849
but then when I put the pieces together,

19:26.851 --> 19:30.285
the picture of who my husband
was started to change.

19:30.645 --> 19:32.521
Secret gambling debts?

19:32.523 --> 19:35.357
He emptied his pension to pay them off.

19:35.359 --> 19:37.059
He mortgaged the house.

19:37.061 --> 19:39.161
Did Joe insist that none
of this was his doing?

19:39.163 --> 19:40.462
He did.

19:40.464 --> 19:42.664
He started to get crazy,

19:42.666 --> 19:44.633
saying the bank was lying,

19:44.635 --> 19:48.770
all these people
were conspiring to frame him.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.739
And when I wouldn't believe him,

19:50.741 --> 19:53.476
he became paranoid about safety,

19:54.446 --> 19:57.713
convinced something awful
was going to happen to Hayley.

auto company was out to get him.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.787
Voysec, yeah.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.523
He blamed them for everything.

20:07.525 --> 20:09.791
The entire basement wall was covered

20:09.793 --> 20:13.662
in newspaper clippings, e-mails, photos.

20:15.766 --> 20:17.065
What's going on?

20:17.067 --> 20:18.967
I don't think your husband was crazy,

20:18.969 --> 20:21.403
and now someone
really is out to get him.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.167
Joe is an investigator for
the Transportation Safety Board.

20:40.169 --> 20:41.268
Was.

20:41.270 --> 20:43.037
He was fired six months ago

20:43.039 --> 20:44.505
for embezzling funds.

20:44.507 --> 20:47.508
Since then, he's racked up
600 grand in personal debt.

20:47.510 --> 20:49.881
But, why would he take Fraser?

20:50.346 --> 20:53.047
Yeah, he's a straight arrow,
meticulous, ethical.

20:53.049 --> 20:54.448
You sure you got the right guy?

20:54.450 --> 20:55.583
So he needs money,

20:55.585 --> 20:58.452
and he knows how vital
Fraser is to the company.

20:58.975 --> 21:01.222
But he hasn't asked for money.

21:02.949 --> 21:04.658

21:04.660 --> 21:06.360
How do we find my husband?

21:06.362 --> 21:08.963
Zara and Oliver will check out
Mr. Morris's last known address,

to his wife's place
