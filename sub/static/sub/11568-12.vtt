00:08.308 --> 00:10.475
Good afternoon, Boss.
Can I hook you up
with a supreme...

00:10.510 --> 00:13.612
Bup-bup-bup.
You don't need to sell me
any of that supreme shit.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.680
I just need
the regular wash, okay?

00:15.715 --> 00:18.083
Just a regular wash,
the $9.99 one.

00:18.118 --> 00:20.652
Yeah, okay, boss.
No Armor All for the tires?

00:20.687 --> 00:23.422
Yeah, hit 'em
with the high-gloss
tire spray, man.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.323
Make them shine
like new money.

00:25.358 --> 00:29.094
I like that sexy, wet,
jet-black, high shine.

00:29.129 --> 00:32.931
Okay, how about a wax?
The supreme wash comes
with a wax for the paint

00:32.966 --> 00:35.367
that protects the car
from oxidation and corrosion.

00:35.402 --> 00:38.403
No, I just want
that regular wash
with the tire spray.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.439
So, you're not worried
about the oxidation?

00:40.474 --> 00:43.442
Oh, I'm worried about it.
This is an older vehicle.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.410
I'm also worried
about corrosion.

00:45.445 --> 00:46.845
Is that something
you talked about

00:46.880 --> 00:48.513
or was I just
thinking that out?

00:48.548 --> 00:49.981
I don't know, but either way

00:50.016 --> 00:52.184
the supreme wash will
take care of the corrosion

00:52.219 --> 00:53.718
and the oxidation.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.487
Plus you get
to pick your scent.

00:55.522 --> 00:57.522
I don't want any of that shit.
I just want shiny tires,

00:57.557 --> 00:59.758
a wax,
and an apple cinnamon smell.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.726
But no steam clean
today, Boss?

01:01.761 --> 01:03.862
Damn, fool, yes, steam clean!

01:08.268 --> 01:12.204

does it take for a regular,
basic car wash?

-Thank you.

Hmm? No,
I don't need that... Okay.

-I'm Marquess.
-Anne.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.518
Everything okay?

01:26.553 --> 01:29.354
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

01:29.389 --> 01:32.491
(SNIFFLES) No.
No, I'm not fine.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.359
I just found out I'm pregnant

01:34.394 --> 01:36.361
and when I told Adam,
he's my boyfriend,

01:36.396 --> 01:37.896
he just completely shut down.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.098
I mean, he didn't
say anything. Not a word.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.700
Just walked out the door.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.136
He's one of those nice guys
that never yells.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.104
We never argued. Never.

01:46.139 --> 01:49.341
But every once in a while,
Adam could say something
so heartless.

01:49.376 --> 01:52.377
I mean, I always said
he was missing
a sensitivity chip,

01:52.412 --> 01:54.513
but he was never
intentionally cruel, but...

01:54.548 --> 01:57.849
I don't know.
You find out your girlfriend
is pregnant and you just...

01:57.884 --> 01:59.317

(CRIES)

02:08.862 --> 02:10.962
I know he loves me,
I really do. I'm just...

02:10.997 --> 02:13.665
I'm so scared
to be alone right now.

02:23.176 --> 02:24.776
It was $93.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.179
Yeah, but I can smell
that cinnamon apple from here.

02:27.214 --> 02:30.649
So imagine how strong it is
when I get inside the van!

02:31.851 --> 02:34.085
Ooh, damn! I don't have
any cash for a tip.

02:34.120 --> 02:37.155

Hey, lady, you got a one?

02:37.190 --> 02:38.890
-Michael!
-What?

02:38.925 --> 02:41.426
I've paid by credit card.
You got one dollar?

02:41.461 --> 02:42.961
I only have a ten.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.363
That's fine. I'm a celeb
that should tip big anyway.

MARQUESS: Michael!
We have to help this woman!

02:49.202 --> 02:52.537
-What woman?
-The woman you
just took $10 from.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.706
She gave me $10, Marquess.

02:54.741 --> 02:57.409
In any event,
she is desperate for help

02:57.444 --> 02:59.144
and we should give it to her.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.845
Ask Pigeon what he thinks.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.981
-Where is he?
-MAN: Hey, man!

03:03.016 --> 03:03.982
Is this your bird?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.418
He got sucked up
when we were vacuuming.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.888
I don't know if he's dead
or what, but he messed up
our vacuum cleaner pretty bad.

I, uh... I kinda think
this is more of a job
for a couples' counselor.

03:23.970 --> 03:27.572
Okay, so that's
a "no" from Yung,
a "yes" from Marquess,

03:27.607 --> 03:29.341
and an "abstained"
from Pigeon.

I'm the swing vote, huh?

go in your car, lady,

just got cleaned.

if you're a dirty person

a lot more to the story.

have to do with me?

to be his girlfriend?

06:57.383 --> 06:59.617
We didn't choose you, he did.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.820
Adam is
a fully-autonomous being.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.488
That's the definition of A.I.

07:03.523 --> 07:06.157
By some measures,
he is as human
as you or I.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.760
Of course, he lacks
sensitivity and empathy.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.428

a washing machine.

was actually closer
to what he is.

jump down my throat
when I said it?

is uploading something

Ooh, I'm gonna make
you pay back slow.

10:16.516 --> 10:17.782
You're a (BLEEP) pigeon.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.317
You're gonna wish
you died in this bag

10:19.352 --> 10:21.152
with all the shit
I'm gonna make you do for me.

Wow! What an honor
to be invited into
the delivery room.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.731
