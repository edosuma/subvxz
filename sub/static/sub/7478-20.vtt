WEBVTT

00:30.739 --> 00:31.818
No.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.027
I said no.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.030
What's this guy doing?

00:37.537 --> 00:39.115
- Look out.
- Ah!

00:42.793 --> 00:45.248
- Stay here. No, stay here.
- No. Okay.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.633
Oh, son of a... God.

00:52.636 --> 00:55.756
Hey, what the hell, man?
What's wrong with...? Oh, man.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.400
Hey, open the door.

00:58.424 --> 01:01.411
Hey, open the door, man.
Wake up.

01:01.435 --> 01:04.248
Hey, come on, man.
Open the door. Wake up.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.231
Open the door.

01:07.526 --> 01:08.937
Get him out of the car.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.529
It's gonna go.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.273
- No.
- No.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.610
Know what young people say
they wanna be when they grow up?

01:41.634 --> 01:44.111
Probably not a Navy SEAL.

01:44.135 --> 01:48.120
Not a teacher, not an astronaut,
or anything that requires effort.

01:48.144 --> 01:50.119
All kids wanna be is famous.

01:50.143 --> 01:51.575
And girls just wanna have fun.

01:51.599 --> 01:53.628
Look, 15 minutes of fame
is nothing new.

01:53.652 --> 01:56.834
- Good morning, guys.
- Morning, Nate.

01:56.858 --> 01:58.041
- Good workout?
- Yeah.

01:58.065 --> 02:00.864
I maxed out the delts. I'm feeling that.
And my glutes.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.328
Keeping my glutes in shape.

02:03.749 --> 02:07.259
A guy carves a 10-foot-tall human
out of stone and buries it.

02:07.283 --> 02:10.330
Then he discovers a petrified giant.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.813
Media has a frenzy,
people come from all over.

02:12.837 --> 02:16.483
A story of instant celebrity from,
drum roll,

02:16.507 --> 02:18.528
1868.

02:18.552 --> 02:20.322
There's a sucker born every minute.

02:20.346 --> 02:23.362
Actually, Barnum never even
said the famous quotation.

02:23.386 --> 02:25.327
Barnum made a second stone giant.

02:25.351 --> 02:26.991
And the guy who owned the first one

02:27.015 --> 02:29.703
said people who saw Barnum's giant
were suckers.

02:29.727 --> 02:32.746
Yeah, so we celebrate Barnum
for a quote he never said

02:32.770 --> 02:36.527
about a phoney replica
of a crackpot hoax.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.631
Well, well.

02:42.655 --> 02:44.549
- Deeks.
- Callen.

02:44.573 --> 02:48.009
- Doc.
- Sorry, I'm a little sore in the delts.

02:48.033 --> 02:49.217
But the glutes are good?

02:49.241 --> 02:51.578
- You heard that?
- I did.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.392
- Sam?
- The desk is taken, Deeks.

02:54.416 --> 02:56.085
You can't sit there.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.594
Excuse me.

03:00.889 --> 03:05.385
Mr. Hanna,
I asked Detective Deeks to sit there.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.928
I did so politely.

03:08.605 --> 03:12.769
Detective Deeks has been appointed
our L.A.P.D. Liaison,

03:13.485 --> 03:18.917
filling a chair that, though taken,
has been vacant for some time.

03:18.941 --> 03:21.404
- Welcome aboard, Deeks.
- Thanks.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.862
So you're sort of a temp.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.264
Temp? Yeah, I like that.

03:26.288 --> 03:29.078
See, with cops, having a
negative nickname's a good thing.

03:29.835 --> 03:33.511
Okay. No time to waste.
We have a case.

03:33.535 --> 03:35.729
Deeks? Really?

03:35.753 --> 03:39.922
- Deeks. Really. L.A.P.D. Liaison.
- That's the best they could do?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.607
- Oh, hello, Deeks.
- Hey, Kensi.

03:42.631 --> 03:44.265
Oh, and, uh...

03:45.100 --> 03:46.140
It's the best they can do.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.820
- Sorry.
- Forgiven.

03:48.844 --> 03:50.645
What do you got, Eric?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.032
Lieutenant Brian Roth
sailed a car off Mulholland

03:54.056 --> 03:56.249
early this morning
with two bullets in him.

03:56.273 --> 03:58.912
Eyewitness says he was still alive
when he went over,

03:58.936 --> 04:02.423
but he's not anymore.

04:02.447 --> 04:03.969
The car wasn't his.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.592
- Whose was it?
- Belongs to Aubrey Darva.

04:06.616 --> 04:08.163
The Aubrey Darva?

04:10.876 --> 04:12.761
Aubrey's vying for the socialite tiara.

04:12.785 --> 04:16.519
Trying to out-Paris Paris Hilton
and out-Kim the Kardashians.

04:16.543 --> 04:20.024
Photo on the right taken
just last night. Posted on ZMZ.

04:20.048 --> 04:22.103
Famous for being famous.

04:22.127 --> 04:23.940
Welcome to Los Angeles.
The point is

04:23.964 --> 04:25.989
she wouldn't be hanging out
with a nobody sailor.

04:26.013 --> 04:28.116
More likely, this guy stole her car.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.325
- Was it reported stolen?
- No. Not yet.

04:30.349 --> 04:32.489
Ross was at the top of his class
at Annapolis

04:32.513 --> 04:35.037
with a flawless service record.
I wouldn't call him a nobody.

04:35.061 --> 04:37.166
To her he's a nobody.
Not my opinion, Sam.

04:37.190 --> 04:39.662
Let's get up there and tell the L.A.P.D.
We're interested.

04:39.686 --> 04:41.962
Oh, good thing we have a liaison.

04:41.986 --> 04:45.158
Yeah, good thing.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.725
Okay, Eric.

04:57.749 --> 05:00.105
As soon as you find out,
let me know.

05:00.129 --> 05:02.482
Time to do your liaison thing.

05:02.506 --> 05:04.800
Yeah, about that liaise thing.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.098
What's the wait?
The car's coming up.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.617
- He doesn't want to.
- He doesn't want to what?

05:11.641 --> 05:13.745
- Liaise.
- Is that even a word?

05:13.769 --> 05:16.750
Yes. A liaison liaises.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.934
Well, maybe you can demonstrate.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.894
Thanks.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.885
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

05:27.909 --> 05:31.162
I felt like a mom dropping off her kid
first day of school.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.872
- Hey, guys. How's it going?
- Beat it.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.927
Okay. Appreciate the help.

05:37.951 --> 05:40.561
Doesn't look like
a very warm reception.

05:40.585 --> 05:42.773
- Are we done?
- They told me...

05:42.797 --> 05:44.272
Actually, you don't need to know.

05:44.296 --> 05:47.221
- Is it our crime scene?
- Conversation never got that far.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.092
Leave it to me.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.904
You know how it is
with undercover cops.

05:51.928 --> 05:54.117
I've pissed off more than
my fair share of shields.

05:54.141 --> 05:55.699
Then why'd they choose you?

05:55.723 --> 05:57.937
- Hetty's request.
- Thank you.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.479
Our case. Our crime scene.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.793
You're okay, too, Deeks,
if you're with us.

06:06.817 --> 06:08.272
Let's go, temp.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.933
Okay, two gunshots.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.725
Shoulder, ribs.

06:16.749 --> 06:19.385
This guy would have bled out
even without the crash.

06:19.409 --> 06:21.710
There's blood on the door handle.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.100
Means he got shot
before he got in the car.

06:24.124 --> 06:26.092
Need to find that crime scene.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.357
There's a door stamp for Balm.

06:28.381 --> 06:31.282
- That's the hottest club in Hollywood.
- Okay, so Roth was there.

06:31.306 --> 06:34.321
Something happens that puts him in
Aubrey Darva's car and gets him shot.

06:34.345 --> 06:37.116
Balm isn't just socialite central
for the Aubrey Darvas of the world.

06:37.140 --> 06:38.997
There's a lot of bad guys
hanging out there.

06:39.021 --> 06:42.167
- Yo.
- Eric, a nightclub called Balm.

06:42.191 --> 06:44.329
- Need to see their security footage.
- I'm on it.

06:44.353 --> 06:46.569
- Nothing here.
- Guys?

06:48.491 --> 06:51.196
Shoes, clutch,

06:52.704 --> 06:55.301
cell phone.
Things a girl does not leave behind.

06:55.325 --> 06:57.384
And here. Pink fabric.

06:57.408 --> 07:00.122
Remember that photo taken last night
and posted on ZMZ?

07:00.712 --> 07:01.851
Aubrey Darva.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.170
- She wore a pink dress.
- Find her.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.266
Nice.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.078
Wow. So Aubrey's stepdad
is Ben Darva.

07:23.102 --> 07:24.830
Immigrated a penniless kid,

07:24.854 --> 07:26.249
won a full ride to Harvard,

07:26.273 --> 07:29.376
made billions in real estate and
married a socialite from Pasadena.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.123
Aubrey is her kid, not his.
Mother died a year ago.

07:32.147 --> 07:35.945
- You vacation with these people?
- Heh. No, I just remember things.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.343
Hi, we're looking for Aubrey Darva?

07:38.367 --> 07:40.084
Her father is by the pool.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.837
It must be nice to have your
morning latte next to your pool.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.440
Mr. Darva?
I'm Detective Deeks, L.A.P.D.

07:49.464 --> 07:51.260
This is Special Agent Kensi Blye.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.472
You're having
surveillance cameras installed?

07:55.975 --> 07:58.301
Yeah, because of all the break-ins

07:59.062 --> 08:01.019
in the neighbourhood
over the last year.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.059
No one is safe.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.624
I'm assuming that's why you're here.

08:06.648 --> 08:09.334
No, we're here because
of your stepdaughter, Aubrey.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.654
- Aubrey?
- Did she come home last night?

08:12.242 --> 08:14.697
Oh, yes. Yes, she always
comes home. It's part of our deal.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.411
- Could you check on her, please?
- Sure. This way.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.219
- Part of your deal?
- Yeah.

08:21.243 --> 08:25.261
Aubrey had a problem with drugs
after her mother died, but I trust her.

08:25.285 --> 08:26.637
She's bouncing back.

08:26.661 --> 08:30.232
We have certain rules,
it was her idea.

08:30.256 --> 08:32.964
Are you gonna tell me
what this is all about?

08:34.764 --> 08:37.278
Her car was found at the bottom
of a cliff this morning.

08:37.302 --> 08:38.756
So someone stole her car?

08:39.394 --> 08:40.971
That's what we're here to find out.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.313
Aubrey, there are people here
to see you.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.363
Aubrey?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.277
Aubrey?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.947
We have a deal. I don't understand.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.374
Okay, what is this?
What haven't you told me?

09:04.419 --> 09:07.503
I'm sorry, Mr. Darva, but the driver
of the car had been in a shooting.

09:08.339 --> 09:12.005
Oh, my God. Aubrey.

09:22.844 --> 09:24.101
BOLO's out on Aubrey Darva.

09:24.125 --> 09:27.115
Eric's checking a number she called
every day for the last six months.

09:27.139 --> 09:29.655
Okay, perfect. Thanks.
Got something.

09:29.679 --> 09:32.579
A police report on the break-ins
in the neighbourhood. I have ten.

09:32.603 --> 09:34.823
All high-end houses, all unsolved.

09:34.847 --> 09:37.669
Nine of those addresses
are in Aubrey's phone.

09:37.693 --> 09:38.998
She knows the victims.

09:39.022 --> 09:41.875
You think she's mixed up with a
break-in crew? Supplying them targets?

09:41.899 --> 09:43.791
She would know their habits,
their schedules,

09:43.815 --> 09:45.674
maybe even their security systems.

09:45.698 --> 09:48.002
How does this tie into
Midshipman Roth?

09:48.026 --> 09:50.635
Maybe Roth stumbles onto the ring,
tries to be a hero.

09:50.659 --> 09:53.511
Or he's part of the ring, and infighting
gets he and Aubrey popped.

09:53.535 --> 09:56.520
- Except Aubrey doesn't need money.
- That's not quite true.

09:56.544 --> 09:58.063
She's been in drug rehab

09:58.087 --> 10:00.936
and her stepfather has tied her
sizeable allowance to her recovery.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.359
So maybe she's relapsing,
needs cash to buy drugs.

10:04.383 --> 10:07.008
- You pulled her file?
- Sure, but I knew that already.

10:07.973 --> 10:10.950
What? I enjoy my juicy celebrity gossip
as much as the next guy.

10:10.974 --> 10:14.452
It's hard to believe a guy like Roth
would be tied up in a break-in crew.

10:14.476 --> 10:17.054
Well, if he was
his shipmates would know.

10:18.108 --> 10:19.686
Nice door stamp.

10:21.570 --> 10:23.170
I'm here because I went to a club?

10:23.194 --> 10:25.486
You're here because
your buddy didn't come home.

10:26.032 --> 10:27.195
Brian didn't come home?

10:27.784 --> 10:29.634
Maybe he's still with that girl.

10:29.658 --> 10:32.117
- Sorry.
- He's dead?

10:32.998 --> 10:34.622
I don't believe it.

10:36.001 --> 10:38.243
Roth was a guy
who was gonna live forever.

10:39.713 --> 10:40.934
Lieutenant Perfect.

10:40.958 --> 10:42.506
What did you do yesterday?

10:43.425 --> 10:45.808
We threw Brian a birthday bash.

10:45.832 --> 10:48.063
His birthday's not till June.

10:48.087 --> 10:50.812
L.A. Beats a port-call in Yemen
for fun, okay?

10:50.836 --> 10:53.068
We deploy in two weeks.
Roth's a card nut,

10:53.092 --> 10:56.031
so we spent the afternoon
playing poker.

10:56.055 --> 10:59.539
Then we go to Balm,
and Brian hooks up with this hot date.

10:59.563 --> 11:01.560
I mean Fantasy Island hot.

11:02.152 --> 11:03.243
And he leaves with her.

11:03.267 --> 11:05.793
- That piss you off?
- Are you kidding me?

11:05.817 --> 11:07.543
I'm waiting to hear his stories.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.756
I mean, ten months at sea,

11:09.780 --> 11:12.786
you want to hear tales like that
and know they're real.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.032
I can't believe he's gone.

11:17.083 --> 11:19.206
You see Fantasy Island in here?

11:21.546 --> 11:22.709
That's her.

11:23.298 --> 11:26.418
- Is she famous?
- Trying to be.

11:27.177 --> 11:28.505
And she's missing.

11:30.096 --> 11:32.766
- What do you know about that?
- Nothing.

11:33.308 --> 11:35.514
She and Roth left the club
about 11:30.

11:35.936 --> 11:38.640
- Hadley and I headed back to base.
- Right away?

11:41.775 --> 11:43.625
Yeah, see, that's funny.

11:43.649 --> 11:45.455
Because if that was true,

11:45.479 --> 11:47.753
you would have made it to Point Mugu
by 1 a.m.

11:47.777 --> 11:49.821
But you didn't check in until 4.

11:50.450 --> 11:52.407
We went for a swim
in Santa Monica.

11:53.245 --> 11:54.964
That Ferris wheel has great lights.

11:54.988 --> 11:56.539
Tell me, were they still on?

11:59.334 --> 12:01.243
Yeah, you kind of walked into that.

12:02.838 --> 12:04.771
Your buddy's dead,
his girl's missing,

12:04.795 --> 12:08.060
and this hole in your time line
does not look good.

12:08.084 --> 12:11.521
- Did you follow them from the club?
- No. No.

12:11.545 --> 12:14.319
- You ever robbed a house?
- What's that have to do with anything?

12:14.343 --> 12:16.864
- Where's Aubrey Darva?
- I told you, I don't know.

12:16.888 --> 12:18.435
So where'd you go after Balm?

12:23.191 --> 12:26.038
Hadley's scared like something went
down and Tyre told him to keep quiet.

12:26.062 --> 12:28.204
Well, Tyre is Roth's shipmate,
but not his friend.

12:28.228 --> 12:29.495
Never used his first name.

12:29.519 --> 12:30.919
All right. Thanks, Eric.

12:30.943 --> 12:34.508
The phone Aubrey calls every day
belongs to her rehab sponsor.

12:34.532 --> 12:35.865
I'll give him a call.

12:36.246 --> 12:37.965
- These aren't our shooters?
- I doubt it.

12:37.989 --> 12:40.738
They both seem genuinely surprised
Roth's dead.

12:41.209 --> 12:43.249
There's nothing
that doesn't belong here.

12:43.712 --> 12:46.439
No stolen watches, no jewellery.

12:46.463 --> 12:48.339
No thick wad of cash.

12:48.967 --> 12:52.585
You don't go to Annapolis to blow it all
by falling in with some break-in crew.

12:53.221 --> 12:55.024
What are these guys hiding?

12:55.048 --> 12:57.679
Maybe they know more about
what happened to Aubrey.

12:59.185 --> 13:02.554
The longer she's missing,
the less likely we find her alive.

13:03.064 --> 13:04.369
What do you have?

13:04.393 --> 13:07.543
This is the audio from the
SOS system in Aubrey's Mercedes.

13:07.567 --> 13:10.333
I picked up Roth
saying something over and over.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.819
His voice is super-weak
but here's what I got.

13:19.205 --> 13:20.973
Something, something "king."

13:20.997 --> 13:22.577
Definitely "king."

13:23.084 --> 13:25.516
You don't waste your dying words.
He's saying who shot him.

13:25.540 --> 13:28.179
Sounds like "club." It's a club king.

13:28.203 --> 13:30.421
"Club" could be Balm.

13:31.051 --> 13:33.731
- "King" could be a person.
- Or it could be kingpin.

13:33.755 --> 13:35.529
There's lots of those at Balm.

13:35.553 --> 13:38.403
And Roth left with Aubrey.
Maybe she was somebody else's girl.

13:38.427 --> 13:41.470
Making jealousy a possible motive
for shooting him.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.739
Let me see the security footage
from Balm.

13:43.763 --> 13:45.492
There is none.

13:45.516 --> 13:48.667
- They won't hand it over?
- None to hand over. No cameras.

13:48.691 --> 13:50.912
That's why it's so popular
with the rich and infamous.

13:50.936 --> 13:52.120
Nobody's watching.

13:52.144 --> 13:55.133
And you can forget about witnesses
because even if something did happen,

13:55.157 --> 13:58.468
- everybody's looking the other way.
- The clock's ticking for the girl.

13:58.492 --> 13:59.824
If she's still alive.

14:00.246 --> 14:01.954
Then we're going clubbing.

14:05.418 --> 14:07.434
If some kingpin at the club
had Roth shot,

14:07.458 --> 14:09.894
it supports Nate's theory
that his bunkmates didn't do it.

14:09.918 --> 14:13.020
They haven't told us where they went.
We're gonna have to stay on them.

14:13.044 --> 14:14.308
What do you say, Sam?

14:14.332 --> 14:16.111
Want to spend a swanky night
in a hot club

14:16.135 --> 14:18.985
or sweating Navy guys
in a cold room.

14:19.009 --> 14:22.776
All right, this is a fantastic plan, but
you don't just waltz into Balm, okay?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.946
I get in on the connection
I worked hard to develop.

14:24.970 --> 14:26.617
Maybe Kensi gets in
because she's hot.

14:26.641 --> 14:29.578
I'm just saying, don't make it weird.
But you? Only one way in for you.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.783
- Money.
- And a lot of it.

14:30.807 --> 14:32.456
You gotta be ready to pay.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.382
- How much are we talking?
- Guys drop 30 grand a night.

14:35.406 --> 14:37.008
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:37.032 --> 14:39.667
Tell you what, why don't you go
ask Hetty for that, temp?

14:39.691 --> 14:41.494
Yeah. I'll go do that.

14:46.167 --> 14:47.994
I'll go. I'll go ask her.

14:59.514 --> 15:02.005
What can I do for you, Mr. Deeks?

15:03.393 --> 15:06.239
I've been sent to ask for funds
to get into a nightclub undercover

15:06.263 --> 15:09.972
in an attempt to identify Roth
and possibly Aubrey Darva's killer.

15:12.152 --> 15:14.334
That's uncharacteristically
formal speech.

15:14.358 --> 15:17.198
You must be asking for
a lot of money.

15:24.831 --> 15:27.298
Listen, here's the deal, okay?

15:27.322 --> 15:30.477
The only way I get us all in
is if I sell Callen as a big spender.

15:30.501 --> 15:32.888
And that means he needs
to flash one of those credit cards

15:32.912 --> 15:34.998
with a no-questions-asked
kind of limit.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.217
How about this?

15:57.447 --> 15:59.629
Fifty-thousand-dollar limit.

15:59.653 --> 16:06.419
However, if more than $5,000
is charged to this card,

16:06.443 --> 16:09.006
I will come for you
with my letter opener.

16:09.030 --> 16:13.265
- Is that clear, Mr. Deeks?
- Got it.

16:13.289 --> 16:17.353
Wait. What?
You want me to sign this?

16:17.377 --> 16:20.895
Because it's Callen's card.

16:20.919 --> 16:23.135
And you're the guarantor.

16:24.182 --> 16:27.302
Mr. Callen, your credit card.

16:27.977 --> 16:30.195
Fifty-thousand-dollar limit.

16:30.219 --> 16:33.232
Backstopped in the name
of Ivan Kolvak.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.940
Wardrobe.

16:45.036 --> 16:46.554
There's a trick somewhere.

16:46.578 --> 16:49.866
- It's gotta be a trick.
- No trick. Just ask nicely.

16:52.252 --> 16:56.854
Deeks talked you into handing over
a card with a $50,000 limit.

16:56.878 --> 16:58.293
Really?

16:59.050 --> 17:00.437
Do you remember Rio?

17:00.461 --> 17:04.988
That vicuna suit you wore,
it cost 10 grand.

17:05.012 --> 17:07.174
The cops hate Deeks.

17:07.892 --> 17:13.823
In Miami you nearly scuttled
a Feretti yacht of an Omani prince.

17:13.847 --> 17:15.031
Ooh.

17:15.055 --> 17:17.605
He's a lousy liaison.

17:18.278 --> 17:20.744
And yet I get the sense
he isn't temporary.

17:20.769 --> 17:24.173
The repairs alone cost more than
the limit on that credit card.

17:24.196 --> 17:28.317
Hetty, I'm not complaining
that you gave him the money.

17:28.705 --> 17:31.908
How could you, Mr. Callen?
I gave you the card.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.576
You don't want him as a liaison.

17:36.045 --> 17:37.421
You want him as an agent.

17:38.756 --> 17:44.261
If they play Lady Gaga tonight,
dance one for me, would you?

18:06.117 --> 18:07.552
Ivan Kolvak and party.

18:07.576 --> 18:09.024
Back of the line.

18:09.829 --> 18:12.213
Heh. I'm sorry.
We were told that we were on the list.

18:12.237 --> 18:13.743
Not on the list.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.264
- Back of the line.
- No, it's okay, Jessie. They're with me.

18:17.288 --> 18:19.680
Well, you should have said so.

18:19.704 --> 18:21.316
- All right, brother.
- Thanks, man.

18:21.340 --> 18:23.251
- Yeah, come on in.
- Thanks.

18:34.103 --> 18:36.511
- Tim, baby.
- There she is.

18:37.398 --> 18:39.201
So this is your friend.

18:39.225 --> 18:43.374
Ivan Kolvak. His dad runs the
Russian oil business, you know?

18:43.398 --> 18:45.955
Oh, well, Ivan, I am Sapphire.

18:45.979 --> 18:47.758
If there's anything you need,
you ask me.

18:47.782 --> 18:51.093
I have you at the best table in
the house with a lot of lovely ladies

18:51.117 --> 18:54.050
- that are excited to meet you.
- That's great.

18:54.074 --> 18:55.529
Would you like to open a tab?

19:00.088 --> 19:03.457
- God, I love this job.
- I can see why.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.479
She looks like a high-class madam.

19:07.503 --> 19:10.062
Yeah, except for sex is optional.

19:10.086 --> 19:13.883
- It's the scene, what can I say?
- She called you Tim.

19:14.143 --> 19:15.827
- Been here before?
- Undercover.

19:15.851 --> 19:17.407
- Hers?
- Ha-ha-ha.

19:17.431 --> 19:19.704
God, you're like a bull
instead of a tiger.

19:19.728 --> 19:23.873
You just charge on in there.
Thank you, darling. Whoa.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.612
Ladies.

19:32.453 --> 19:33.461
I don't believe it.

19:33.485 --> 19:36.260
Callen, my 12 o'clock.

19:36.284 --> 19:39.292
Aubrey Darva. Alive.

19:44.257 --> 19:45.917
And well enough to party.

19:58.110 --> 20:00.436
Our victim just became our suspect.

20:01.739 --> 20:03.708
This place is a Who's Who.

20:03.732 --> 20:05.947
Of who's bad.

20:06.953 --> 20:09.170
Aubrey was speaking to that
scrawny guy over there.

20:09.194 --> 20:10.890
That's Mr. Blood Diamond himself.

20:10.914 --> 20:13.928
And now she's talking to
A.J. Madjan, the mad Armenian.

20:13.952 --> 20:16.060
A guy like that'll kill over an insult.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.878
Or a girl like Aubrey.

20:18.840 --> 20:22.422
Any one of them could have
passed as a club king to Roth.

20:23.302 --> 20:25.461
So the question is,
what does Aubrey know?

20:26.305 --> 20:27.681
Time to find out.

20:31.102 --> 20:33.747
- I'm gonna call you Fern, okay?
- Don't you dare call me Fern.

20:33.771 --> 20:36.370
Fern. Baby girl. Whoo.
It's been a long time.

20:36.394 --> 20:38.250
- Not interested.
- Come on. I got a special.

20:38.274 --> 20:40.577
- Excuse me.
- I got it all. I got E, I got all the coke

20:40.601 --> 20:43.447
- you could sink your pretty face into.
- I said no.

20:50.496 --> 20:52.655
I don't believe the jerks in this place.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.698
Sorry. I don't mean you. It's just...

20:56.252 --> 20:58.043
Haven't been here since l...

20:59.589 --> 21:02.340
You know, good job saying no.

21:04.886 --> 21:07.341
He was a friend. Used to be.

21:08.347 --> 21:10.316
You don't really need to know
all this stuff.

21:10.340 --> 21:11.737
It's okay.

21:11.761 --> 21:15.410
You have to dump friends
who don't get it

21:15.434 --> 21:17.681
and make new ones who do.

21:19.191 --> 21:25.905
I haven't made a friend sober
since I was pretty young.

21:30.453 --> 21:33.869
- I'm Fern.
- Aubrey.

21:35.541 --> 21:37.759
I thought I recognised you.

21:37.783 --> 21:42.005
L.A. Story, I guess. You go for a coffee
and there's Zoe Saldana.

21:43.049 --> 21:46.394
- Can you tell I'm from Iowa?
- No, no. No, I get it.

21:46.418 --> 21:48.728
I saw Jeremy Piven today.

21:48.752 --> 21:52.215
I don't know why, but that man just...

21:52.934 --> 21:54.344
Oh, he does it for me.

21:54.936 --> 21:57.118
Where? When?

21:57.142 --> 22:00.230
At the spa.
A friend took me for my six months.

22:00.816 --> 22:03.224
- Wow. Six months clean.
- Mm-mm.

22:03.611 --> 22:06.316
You'll make it, Fern. Hang in there.

22:08.991 --> 22:12.052
Fern. That was your doing, huh?

22:12.076 --> 22:14.284
Kensi is going to kill you.

22:14.789 --> 22:17.931
I'll tell you what. That Aubrey doesn't
look like she killed anybody last night.

22:17.955 --> 22:22.123
So either she doesn't know about
Roth or her car, or she is ice cold.

22:23.214 --> 22:25.919
Sapphire said this stuff
is a thousand dollars a bottle.

22:26.342 --> 22:27.753
Right.

22:31.222 --> 22:32.989
Hetty cut a side deal with you,
didn't she?

22:33.013 --> 22:37.203
- That's how you got the card.
- Yeah.

22:37.227 --> 22:39.518
So, what's your limit? Fifteen?

22:40.564 --> 22:42.107
Ten?

22:43.275 --> 22:45.233
Come on, five?

22:47.989 --> 22:51.879
I'm supposed to look like I can spend
50 and you're on the hook after 5?

22:51.903 --> 22:54.282
She threatened me
with a letter opener.

22:55.788 --> 22:58.030
I guess some people gotta learn
the hard way.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.076
Why? What are you...?

23:01.961 --> 23:03.894
- We'll take two more bottles.
- Okay.

23:03.918 --> 23:06.981
No, she's... Okay, see you.
Listen. Psst. Hey. No, no, no.

23:07.005 --> 23:08.431
We're good. We're done.

23:08.455 --> 23:11.552
He was... That was a joke.
He's funny.

23:13.389 --> 23:14.645
What do you have, Sam?

23:14.669 --> 23:17.150
Hadley and Tyre.
They're not our guys.

23:17.174 --> 23:19.735
Spent most of their money and time
with ladies on their laps.

23:19.759 --> 23:23.282
Then the club's head geisha
sent the girls to another table.

23:23.306 --> 23:26.269
Yeah, I'm looking at
the head geisha now.

23:26.819 --> 23:30.627
- Where'd they go after?
- A house of ill repute.

23:30.651 --> 23:33.468
- A cheap one.
- Hey, Callen? Interrupting here.

23:33.492 --> 23:35.509
- I got something.
- What is it, Eric?

23:35.533 --> 23:37.968
Aubrey isn't the only common factor
in the break-ins.

23:37.992 --> 23:41.473
The more recent victims
had credit card charges at Balm.

23:41.497 --> 23:43.102
Any activity on my card here?

23:43.126 --> 23:45.085
Yeah, they looked
at your credit limit.

23:46.088 --> 23:48.840
That's a great way to figure out
if someone's worth robbing.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.984
Find out just how close
they looked, Eric.

23:51.008 --> 23:52.968
Roger that.

23:53.554 --> 23:57.480
Sometimes I just get so over
being famous.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.901
Do you ever date normal guys?

23:59.925 --> 24:02.486
You know, I met this guy last night.

24:02.510 --> 24:05.013
- A Navy officer. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ah.

24:05.399 --> 24:07.000
He didn't even know who I was.

24:07.024 --> 24:09.565
- He liked you for who you are.
- Crazy, huh?

24:10.821 --> 24:12.671
- Can I talk to you?
- No, Chaz.

24:12.695 --> 24:14.632
I told you that I am not talking.

24:14.656 --> 24:18.989
- Hey, what's your problem?
- Not your damn business.

24:25.002 --> 24:26.009
Guys. Problem.

24:26.033 --> 24:27.931
Someone's grabbed Aubrey.

24:27.955 --> 24:31.215
Stay with her, Kens.
And don't break cover.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.883
You think just because
you're in rehab you can walk?

24:35.346 --> 24:36.353
You're in way too deep.

24:36.377 --> 24:39.011
If I had known for a second
what you were doing... Oh!

24:40.726 --> 24:42.362
- Hey. Leave her alone.
- Or what?

24:42.386 --> 24:44.554
- Smile for the cops.
- Take care of her.

24:49.527 --> 24:51.127
Stay down on the ground.

24:51.151 --> 24:52.862
Put your hands behind your head.
Now.

24:55.908 --> 24:58.636
Damn it. Callen, had to break cover.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.595
I've lost Aubrey.

25:00.619 --> 25:02.745
I got her, Kens.

25:05.876 --> 25:08.581
Deeks, south stairwell.

25:32.611 --> 25:33.691
Stay back.

25:38.242 --> 25:39.570
Drop the gun. Let her go.

25:44.081 --> 25:46.121
No way, man. I'll pop her.

25:46.792 --> 25:47.823
I've got it, Callen.

25:48.335 --> 25:50.293
I'm walking out of here. Now.

25:50.754 --> 25:52.581
Need you to move now, Deeks.

26:02.183 --> 26:04.756
Hey. Hey, you okay? You okay?

26:05.644 --> 26:07.613
- You're not from Iowa, are you?
- No.

26:07.637 --> 26:09.605
And my name is not Fern.

26:19.874 --> 26:23.848
Chaz used to be my dealer.

26:23.872 --> 26:28.292
- But the blond guy, he...?
- He's a cop.

26:29.134 --> 26:30.462
You were very convincing.

26:31.344 --> 26:33.633
He said you were in too deep.

26:34.472 --> 26:37.046
Too deep into what, Aubrey?

26:38.727 --> 26:42.747
Had to do with people getting robbed,
didn't it?

26:42.771 --> 26:44.682
People you know.

26:54.492 --> 26:57.090
Aubrey, if your rehab is for real,

26:57.114 --> 27:00.217
I'm sorry we had to use it
to get to you.

27:00.241 --> 27:04.163
It's one of the hardest parts
of my job. But this is serious.

27:10.008 --> 27:12.214
They asked me if I knew people.

27:13.219 --> 27:14.654
If I did,

27:14.678 --> 27:21.264
I'd tell them about their houses
and schedules, et cetera.

27:21.686 --> 27:24.865
So you were helping them rob
your friends in exchange for drugs?

27:24.889 --> 27:28.398
Chaz said that he sold the info
to paparazzi.

27:29.277 --> 27:33.986
I should've known better,
but I wanted the drugs.

27:34.824 --> 27:37.635
And one morning
I'm on the bathroom floor throwing up

27:37.659 --> 27:42.738
and I hear on the radio that
the Austins had been robbed, and I...

27:43.208 --> 27:45.200
I put it together.

27:47.420 --> 27:49.579
I'd hit rock bottom.

27:51.091 --> 27:53.984
I got in the car
and checked into rehab.

27:54.008 --> 27:57.712
And I have not used

27:58.306 --> 28:01.889
or told those guys a thing since.

28:02.393 --> 28:04.528
Aubrey was between
the suspect and Callen.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.116
He should have let me take the shot.

28:06.140 --> 28:08.995
Yeah? And your bullet goes
through him into her.

28:09.019 --> 28:11.576
Okay, but he only had like an inch
of the guy's head showing.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.447
Which he hit, now, didn't he, temp?

28:16.324 --> 28:18.542
The club used my credit card
to get personal information.

28:18.566 --> 28:21.293
Address, whether or not I made
payments on an alarm system.

28:21.317 --> 28:24.722
It's a whole bunch of stuff. It's actually
a pretty sophisticated search.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.644
Okay, so Aubrey goes sober,
stops providing intel.

28:27.668 --> 28:29.685
So he starts skimming info
off the credit cards.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.931
- Who ran the card?
- That would be your girlfriend.

28:31.955 --> 28:33.294
Sapphire.

28:34.676 --> 28:37.225
Not my girlfriend. It's actually
Tim's girlfriend. And sort of.

28:37.249 --> 28:40.548
So are we arresting her
or should I do my liaiser thing?

28:41.975 --> 28:43.860
We're solving Roth's murder,
Deeks.

28:43.884 --> 28:45.803
And that's definitely not a word.

28:49.816 --> 28:53.600
So you left the club
with Brian Roth. Then what?

28:54.320 --> 28:58.270
Drove to my house.
And we had sex.

29:00.451 --> 29:03.263
He lifted you out of the car.
Your dress got caught on the car door.

29:03.287 --> 29:04.486
Yeah.

29:05.665 --> 29:07.539
How did you know about that?

29:07.959 --> 29:09.157
What happened next?

29:10.628 --> 29:13.178
We fell asleep.

29:13.202 --> 29:16.050
He got up,
I thought to go to the bathroom.

29:16.342 --> 29:19.925
But he was gone when my friend woke
me up at 8, took me to the spa.

29:21.139 --> 29:22.609
I never even looked for the car.

29:22.633 --> 29:25.132
- Did he leave a note?
- No.

29:25.768 --> 29:27.560
I was bummed.

29:28.646 --> 29:32.264
I actually hoped that
he would be there.

29:35.862 --> 29:38.104
Can you take me home now?

29:39.490 --> 29:43.132
Aubrey puts Brian Roth at the
Darva mansion until about 1 a.m.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.973
Then he drives off the cliff at 2:15.

29:45.997 --> 29:47.492
With two bullets in him.

29:47.999 --> 29:50.371
So he took her car,
drove somewhere and got shot.

29:51.294 --> 29:52.753
How far could he have gone, Eric?

29:55.131 --> 29:57.349
Pretty far.
No traffic that time of night.

29:57.373 --> 30:00.041
Okay, so where did he go?

30:00.803 --> 30:03.864
What the hell is he mixed up in
that got him shot?

30:03.888 --> 30:05.278
Gambling debts?

30:05.302 --> 30:06.969
His buddies said he played poker.

30:08.353 --> 30:10.013
They did.

30:10.730 --> 30:11.761
I gotta check something.

30:30.875 --> 30:32.642
Hey, Aubrey,
do you have two cell phones?

30:32.666 --> 30:33.666
No.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.881
- Must be Brian's.
- Battery's dead.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.735
He didn't say anything to you?

30:40.759 --> 30:43.441
Say he'd be right back,
could he borrow your car?

30:43.465 --> 30:46.211
He just snuck out, leaving his phone
and took your Mercedes?

30:46.683 --> 30:49.174
Wait, wait, wait.
He did say something.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.387
He asked me
if he could raid the fridge.

30:51.896 --> 30:54.648
- The fridge?
- It's in the main house.

31:07.954 --> 31:10.077
Fresh paint.

31:13.751 --> 31:14.949
Still tacky.

31:16.087 --> 31:19.847
Okay, so if your blood
is under that paint,

31:19.871 --> 31:21.817
it means you were standing here.

31:21.841 --> 31:23.883
You got shot.

31:24.137 --> 31:25.144
Then what?

31:25.168 --> 31:27.992
Roth didn't say "club king,"
he said "King of Clubs."

31:28.016 --> 31:30.732
- Shot over a poker game?
- It's not a game, it's the deck.

31:30.756 --> 31:33.947
A special deck issued to all the sailors
and soldiers who went to Iraq.

31:33.971 --> 31:36.281
Iraq War Fugitive cards.
Always my lucky deck.

31:36.305 --> 31:39.649
Eric, King of Clubs.
Captured or killed or still at large?

31:41.029 --> 31:42.523
Let's see, Hassan Al-Jahiri.

31:43.031 --> 31:45.332
One of Saddam's top generals.
Still at large.

31:45.356 --> 31:47.193
He was there yesterday
at the house.

31:48.703 --> 31:51.170
Roth must have seen him
or recognised him.

31:51.194 --> 31:53.199
And got shot for it.

31:53.750 --> 31:55.849
In the car, he wasn't just telling us
who shot him.

31:55.873 --> 31:58.724
He was trying to warn us,
like a good soldier should.

31:58.748 --> 32:02.765
Hey, hey. It says here Jahiri's been
advising terrorists via the Internet.

32:02.789 --> 32:04.141
He's providing military tactics

32:04.165 --> 32:07.854
for dozens of attacks over the last
few years from London to Malaysia.

32:07.878 --> 32:09.763
This is one dangerous dude.

32:10.475 --> 32:14.307
Okay, shooter stands here.

32:16.481 --> 32:19.565
Let me see if you left me
any casings.

32:37.001 --> 32:39.138
Oh. Hi.

32:42.131 --> 32:43.246
Lost an earring.

32:56.019 --> 32:57.026
Ben Darva is Persian.

32:57.050 --> 32:59.328
An Iraqi general
is a strange house guest.

32:59.352 --> 33:01.290
Come on, Kensi. Pick up.

33:01.314 --> 33:04.080
My boyfriend jokes and he says
I shouldn't go out with two earrings

33:04.104 --> 33:05.855
because I always lose
one of them, right?

33:07.489 --> 33:10.798
Sorry. Oh. That's him. Hey, Ivan.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.546
Hey, Kensi. You've got company.

33:12.570 --> 33:14.179
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

33:14.203 --> 33:17.467
Listen, Roth was shot at the house.

33:17.491 --> 33:20.311
Oh, my God. I totally think so too.

33:20.335 --> 33:23.681
By Hassan Al-Jahiri,
a former Iraqi general.

33:23.705 --> 33:26.371
I'm gonna send you his photo
and information now.

33:33.473 --> 33:36.510
Oh, my God. That is hilarious.
He is so right in my face. Ha.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.277
Jahiri's in the room.

33:39.301 --> 33:43.892
- Kensi, sit tight.
- Okay, I love you.

33:46.153 --> 33:48.726
Notice how I didn't tell him anything
about losing an earring?

33:49.990 --> 33:52.481
- Do you have anything diet?
- Fridge.

34:02.377 --> 34:05.746
Nope. No diet.

34:08.007 --> 34:10.415
Eric, bring up Kensi's phone.

34:14.097 --> 34:15.484
They're looking right at her.

34:15.507 --> 34:18.196
- Tell me she hasn't been made, Sam.
- No.

34:18.219 --> 34:21.513
He's telling them to burn everything
with blood on it.

34:21.938 --> 34:23.907
Why hasn't she been made?
You were there yesterday.

34:23.931 --> 34:26.147
He must not have seen her.
Just me.

34:26.985 --> 34:27.992
Let's go.

34:28.016 --> 34:29.772
Eric, brief Hetty.

34:30.322 --> 34:31.840
Wait. Shouldn't we send in SWAT?

34:31.864 --> 34:33.799
We're 15 minutes out.
SWAT takes at least 20.

34:33.822 --> 34:36.376
Besides, we go in hot,
it lowers her survival chances.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.069
We've gotta get through that door
without a battering ram.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.675
Who are you?

34:43.699 --> 34:46.368
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Fern.
Nice to meet you.

34:47.339 --> 34:49.462
You still in the kitchen, Kensi?

34:51.342 --> 34:53.525
- Oh, hey, Uncle Steve.
- Hey.

34:53.549 --> 34:59.260
- Well, is it Fern or Kensi?
- It's Fern Kensi.

35:00.810 --> 35:04.452
Aubrey's my sponsor. Oh.
Oh, I wasn't supposed to say.

35:04.476 --> 35:07.375
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No. No, no. It's okay.

35:07.399 --> 35:09.560
- He knows about rehab.
- Oh.

35:11.613 --> 35:14.697
Well, I lost another earring.

35:17.369 --> 35:20.572
Pleasure to meet you. Bye.

35:26.419 --> 35:29.480
Both Darva and Jahiri
went to Harvard.

35:29.504 --> 35:31.807
- They were roommates.
- Look at this. Look at this.

35:31.831 --> 35:35.151
From 1982, Iran and Iraq
are at war with each other.

35:35.175 --> 35:40.660
Darva was attacked by some Iraqi
students and Jahiri saved his life.

35:40.684 --> 35:44.634
And now Darva's returning the favour
by giving him shelter.

35:45.647 --> 35:47.995
- What was that about?
- Uncle Steve?

35:48.019 --> 35:51.750
It's my dad's cousin or something.
He lives in the main house.

35:51.774 --> 35:54.044
You think that he shot Brian?

35:54.068 --> 35:56.338
Can you get off the property
without being seen?

35:56.362 --> 35:57.968
Then go and walk fast.

35:57.992 --> 36:01.326
- Yeah, but why?
- Aubrey, just go.

36:03.581 --> 36:05.373
Are you kidding?

36:07.460 --> 36:09.096
Give me a break.

36:09.120 --> 36:12.189
Guys, why is Kensi going back
into the lion's den?

36:12.213 --> 36:13.769
Because it's her job.

36:13.793 --> 36:16.813
She got Aubrey to safety.
Now she's gotta keep eyes on Jahiri.

36:16.837 --> 36:18.755
He's a high-level target.

36:24.436 --> 36:27.366
Oh, Agent Blye.
Have you found my daughter?

36:27.390 --> 36:29.141
Agent Blye?

36:29.816 --> 36:32.687
- Agent Blye?
- Aubrey's been missing, Hassan.

36:33.445 --> 36:35.733
Aubrey's in her room.

36:36.406 --> 36:41.531
And this woman is a liability.

36:45.582 --> 36:47.409
We've lost her.

36:47.917 --> 36:49.875
Where's Callen?

36:51.671 --> 36:53.711
Closing fast.

36:54.341 --> 36:55.348
What's this about?

36:55.372 --> 36:57.566
- You can't do this.
- It's too late.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.469
You know he's going to kill me.

37:00.555 --> 37:02.607
Just like he killed the man
who died in Aubrey's car.

37:02.631 --> 37:04.325
You've given him a safe place

37:04.349 --> 37:06.569
and in return he's been running
a terrorist operation.

37:06.593 --> 37:10.767
No. Jahiri saved my life.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.747
- I won't let them hurt you.
- Good luck with that.

37:13.771 --> 37:15.248
Hassan, please.

37:15.272 --> 37:18.208
Little League bombing in Guam.
His plan.

37:18.232 --> 37:21.467
The list of his military exploits
is on my phone. Go check.

37:21.491 --> 37:23.569
Pretty big body count.

37:28.041 --> 37:29.618
I owed you, Hassan.

37:30.335 --> 37:33.834
But this? I'm gonna call the police.

37:34.506 --> 37:36.083
Ben.

37:37.717 --> 37:39.876
Thank you for the hospitality.

37:46.142 --> 37:47.934
No. No. No.

37:53.149 --> 37:54.869
Deeks, around back.

37:54.893 --> 37:58.401
Get off me. Get off me.

38:12.961 --> 38:15.203
I need to talk to your boss.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.590
Ah! Callen.

38:31.062 --> 38:32.521
Turn over.

38:56.713 --> 38:58.789
Oh, come on. What?

38:59.174 --> 39:00.644
You had some
Superman double backflip

39:00.668 --> 39:02.193
where you can dodge bullets?

39:02.217 --> 39:04.710
I mean, you can't tell me
I shouldn't have taken that shot.

39:05.513 --> 39:08.348
No. I'm glad you did.

39:17.400 --> 39:20.983
- May I?
- Sure, temp. Just don't touch the doll.

39:22.071 --> 39:23.625
So Sapphire spilled her guts.

39:23.649 --> 39:25.543
The break-in ring involved
our dealer friends,

39:25.567 --> 39:27.129
a couple of ex-con B and E guys

39:27.153 --> 39:29.295
and Sapphire's club girls
that she would use

39:29.319 --> 39:31.879
to keep the target busy at Balm

39:31.903 --> 39:34.288
while the crew would break in
and rob their houses.

39:34.709 --> 39:37.258
That's pretty good PR for the P.D.
On that bust.

39:37.282 --> 39:39.086
Even got a compliment
from my boss.

39:39.589 --> 39:43.254
- That make you feel all gooey inside?
- Like a warm chocolate chip cookie.

39:43.843 --> 39:46.654
You one of those guys who needs
external validation and coddling?

39:46.678 --> 39:50.013
Only from you, Sam.
Wanna coddle me?

39:57.273 --> 40:00.440
Hey. How's your stepdad?

40:00.818 --> 40:02.704
Well, he just got out of surgery.

40:02.728 --> 40:06.296
He is still under from the anaesthesia,
but they think he's going to be okay.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.926
Good.

40:07.950 --> 40:11.344
- You guys are close?
- Not really.

40:11.368 --> 40:14.574
I kind of got dumped on him
after my mom died.

40:15.124 --> 40:16.500
What about your real dad?

40:18.461 --> 40:21.830
My mom said that she would tell me
one day.

40:23.049 --> 40:25.801
You know, when I first met
your stepfather,

40:27.178 --> 40:30.879
he worried about you like a real dad.

40:35.144 --> 40:38.763
I spent a lot of time
looking for my real dad.

40:43.570 --> 40:48.066
But Ben's sort of been that all along.

40:49.409 --> 40:50.440
Hasn't he?

40:54.080 --> 40:57.081
I'll bet you the first thing that he wants
to see when he wakes up is you.

40:57.584 --> 40:59.909
Just so he knows you're okay.

41:12.890 --> 41:17.054
I haven't seen the bill, but if it's over
5 grand, go easy on him.

41:18.021 --> 41:22.872
Why? The cops hate Deeks.
He's a lousy liaison.

41:22.896 --> 41:25.190
It's not what you wanted him for.

41:26.988 --> 41:29.360
You do your homework, don't you?

41:29.991 --> 41:31.402
In choosing agents.

41:33.494 --> 41:35.297
Deeks didn't end up in this building

41:35.321 --> 41:38.367
because we needed some
L.A.P.D. Liaison.

41:39.292 --> 41:41.035
You've been watching him
for a while.

41:42.295 --> 41:46.079
There is value in being patient.

41:47.050 --> 41:49.623
So how long did you watch me
before I joined NCIS?

41:50.053 --> 41:52.674
When did G. Callen
become a blip on your radar?

41:53.806 --> 41:55.550
Was it Kiev?

41:57.560 --> 41:59.185
Houston?

42:01.064 --> 42:02.724
Bogotá?

42:04.484 --> 42:07.626
God, don't tell me it was Jersey City.

42:07.650 --> 42:11.272
- Peking.
- You mean Beijing.

42:18.414 --> 42:20.905
Tea, Mr. Callen?

42:23.461 --> 42:25.786
It was Jersey City, wasn't it?

42:27.048 --> 42:28.648
The gulls are coming in.

42:28.672 --> 42:32.969
That means there is gonna be wicked
swell on the bay by the morning.

42:35.056 --> 42:36.764
- You're a surfer, huh?
- Yeah.

42:37.517 --> 42:39.569
Well, surf early.

42:39.593 --> 42:42.972
I'm sure Hetty told you
we start at 9:30.

42:44.440 --> 42:48.995
Though, after your liaising today,

42:49.019 --> 42:51.247
I'm not sure
why we'd have you back.

42:51.271 --> 42:53.321
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

42:55.785 --> 42:57.670
L.A.P.D. Op I've been trying to set up
for months.

42:57.694 --> 43:00.516
All the pieces finally came together
about an hour ago.

43:00.540 --> 43:02.865
Going undercover tonight.

43:03.876 --> 43:07.956
- For how long?
- Don't know. Cover's pretty deep.

43:11.843 --> 43:13.800
Don't worry, Fern.

43:14.470 --> 43:16.130
I'll be back.

43:21.227 --> 43:23.765
Yeah. Maybe.
