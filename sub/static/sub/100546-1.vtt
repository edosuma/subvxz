I'm Dr. Jackie Deluce.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.601
I'll be in charge of your
therapy from here on out.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.108
How long have you been
out of intensive care?

05:50.551 --> 05:52.217
- Nine days.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.287
- And how're you feeling?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.594
Well, I know one thing,
I know you gotta be sick

06:02.596 --> 06:04.996
of people asking you
questions, yeah?

06:07.234 --> 06:09.935
Sick of being held

06:11.772 --> 06:13.572
You're on clozapine.

- I know.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.312
- Are you feeling better?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.280
- Yes.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.116
- Are you hearing anything

06:24.118 --> 06:28.987
or seeing anything
out of the ordinary?

06:28.989 --> 06:31.289
Anything that
shouldn't be there.
- Nope.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.594
- So why are you here?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.516
You don't belong here?

06:40.517 --> 06:41.967
It's all some big mistake,

- Fuck you.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.906

I'm not the one

06:49.643 --> 06:51.810

06:52.279 --> 06:53.678

I need to be sure
you really are okay,

06:56.283 --> 07:00.085
no longer a threat to yourself
or anyone else, Sybil.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.589
May I call you Sybil?

07:04.591 --> 07:07.325
- Just how do you
determine that exactly?

07:07.327 --> 07:09.094
What sort of calculations
do you run

07:09.096 --> 07:11.997
to see whether I can
get out of here or not, hmm?

07:12.966 --> 07:16.001
What the fuck could you
possibly know about me?

07:18.038 --> 07:20.372

07:22.109 --> 07:24.142
You wanna talk about that?

07:27.648 --> 07:30.348
- I didn't lose my baby.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.823
My baby was taken.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.228
- Why don't you come
tell me about it?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.247
- [Sybil]<i> I was eight months</i>
<i> pregnant.</i>

08:05.085 --> 08:07.185
They drugged me.

08:09.022 --> 08:13.391
Took me to a room underground,
an operating room.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.696
Cut me open.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.398

08:22.903 --> 08:25.070
he wasn't in me anymore.

08:31.245 --> 08:33.979
- How long had you been off
your medications?

08:34.348 --> 08:37.015
- Two weeks, about that.
Don't do that.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.218
- I'm just eliminating
variables.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.821
One of those variables
is your medical history--
- Medical history

08:42.823 --> 08:44.923
of difficulty distinguishing
between what is real

08:44.925 --> 08:47.092
and what is imaginary.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.895
- Yes.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.197
- I was pregnant.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.434
I had to stop.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.373
- Did you get pregnant before
or after your mother died?

09:02.309 --> 09:04.042
- After.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.147
Katherine died
about a year ago.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.483

[bird chirps]

09:18.492 --> 09:21.126
When did Katherine adopt you?

09:21.128 --> 09:22.727
- When I was 16.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.396
It's all in the file,
I'm sure.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.498
- Well, I've read your file,

09:26.500 --> 09:29.401
I'd like to hear you
tell your own story.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.806
- Okay.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.475
[coughs]
Um...

09:38.345 --> 09:40.245
Katherine was a case manager

09:40.247 --> 09:43.148
for the Department of Health
and Human Services.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.286
Her office got a call,

09:48.288 --> 09:51.523
from this woman who said
her baby was in danger.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.761
I guess I wasn't on top
of the stack but, uh,

09:56.763 --> 09:59.864
eventually Katherine
was sent out to investigate.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.436
I had been alone
for three days, dehydrated,

10:04.438 --> 10:06.504

10:07.407 --> 10:09.808
There were no birth records.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.952
Early childhood trauma.
You should jot that down.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.497
She eventually adopted me.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.869
Katherine was always

10:56.256 --> 10:58.056
- Bad people?

10:58.358 --> 11:02.160
- Don't want bad men
to get me.

11:11.238 --> 11:14.973
- Did you know that
there's a special place?

11:14.975 --> 11:18.109
A place that's just for you

11:18.111 --> 11:20.178
that no bad people
can get you.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.915
A place where nobody
can get in or out

11:23.917 --> 11:25.450

11:28.522 --> 11:31.589

where that place is.

who took your baby?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.598

killed Katherine?

- You're dismissing.

12:18.472 --> 12:22.140
You're asking questions based
on a preconceived analysis.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.009
- Two events.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.911
Your pregnancy
and your mother's death

12:26.913 --> 12:29.080
both happening
at the same time.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.582
That's relevant.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.917

another therapist.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.252
- What'd you need?

12:37.624 --> 12:39.457
- I need to leave.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.291
- You think I can just tell the
administration to let you out.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.294
That's not how this works.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.397

present your case.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.668

That person is me.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.685

18:22.735 --> 18:24.569
You should write that down.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.771
- Or maybe he
brought you to life?

18:27.507 --> 18:29.040
You fell in love.

18:29.909 --> 18:33.377
- He was the first time
I remember not feeling alone.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.348
<i> Like...</i>

18:37.350 --> 18:39.016

18:45.692 --> 18:47.358
<i> Even then he was,</i>

<i> the possibility of family.</i>

- Your secret?

20:34.033 --> 20:36.434
- The voices,
the visions.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.738
They're real, you know.

20:42.675 --> 20:46.110
Suddenly awake and asleep
at the same time.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.981
Like a nightmare and I
can hear their thoughts.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.917
I have flashes
of what they want,

20:52.919 --> 20:54.585
what they need.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.787
And what they're scared of.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.123
- Is it like you see
their aura

20:59.125 --> 21:01.692
or their mood
or is it like empathy?

21:01.694 --> 21:03.527
- It's physical.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.063
It's very real.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.599
- Okay.

21:10.737 --> 21:15.773
Have you ever talked
to anybody about--
- I've seen multiply doctors.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.609
Starting at the age of three,
I've been...

21:20.046 --> 21:23.047
called bipolar,
schizophrenic, delusional.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.183
I've been prescribed a dozen
different medications

21:26.185 --> 21:28.719
and 50 different cocktails.

21:29.222 --> 21:31.689
Some of them work
better than others.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.558
Some of them drowned it out.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.769
I can hear people's thoughts.

21:45.705 --> 21:46.971
- What about me?

21:46.972 --> 21:48.238
Can you hear what
I'm thinking right now?

21:48.241 --> 21:50.107
Can you hear my thoughts?

21:51.044 --> 21:53.577
- No, I can't hear
your thoughts.

21:53.579 --> 21:54.945
Um...

21:54.947 --> 21:56.747
It's part of why I like you.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.649
- Try.
Read my mind.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.828
- I can't.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.197
Just every now and then,
it doesn't happen very often,

22:13.199 --> 22:17.735
but it's like
they're blocked or...

22:17.737 --> 22:19.670
foggy somehow.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.141
[chuckles]
It's-- It's rare.

22:24.143 --> 22:28.546
Everyone else, it's like
a pool filled with red water.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.549
And I just fall in.

22:32.251 --> 22:33.851
- Can you show me?

22:36.122 --> 22:38.089
[whimsical music]

22:38.091 --> 22:40.157
¶¶

22:55.274 --> 22:57.308
- Ten o'clock, the girl
in the purple coat.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.009
See if you can hear her.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.592
[faint echoes]

23:29.175 --> 23:30.207
- Pregnant.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.109
She just found out
she's pregnant.

23:38.885 --> 23:39.950
- Excuse me,

23:39.952 --> 23:41.619
I'm conducting
a research study

23:41.621 --> 23:43.721
on women right
around your age.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.356
Sorry to intrude.

23:45.792 --> 23:49.760
Any chance that you...
may be pregnant?

23:53.733 --> 23:55.733
- I can't help you.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.601
- I'm sorry.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.341
[sighs]
I don't know.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.810
I mean, maybe you have
good intuition

24:05.812 --> 24:07.495
but are you reading
her mind?

24:07.496 --> 24:09.179
I don't know.
- She's also going
to meet her fiancé

24:09.182 --> 24:10.681
but she wants
to get drunk first

24:10.683 --> 24:12.783
because she feels guilty
for sleeping with her boss

24:12.785 --> 24:14.885
and doesn't know
whose kid it is.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.124
Why don't you ask her
about that?

24:22.795 --> 24:25.362
- [Dr. Deluce]<i> And this ability</i>
<i> is related to your blood.</i>

24:25.364 --> 24:28.165
Very rare blood type.
Correct?

24:29.268 --> 24:31.635
- Look, I know that you're
not inclined to believe me

24:31.637 --> 24:34.405
and I understand that a history
of mental health issues

24:34.407 --> 24:36.040
is relevant.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.842
The fact that
I was diagnosed

24:37.844 --> 24:39.243
with schizophrenia
in the past

24:39.245 --> 24:40.845
does not negate the fact

24:40.847 --> 24:43.747
that my baby was taken
ten days ago.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.853
- Sybil,
where are we right now?

24:48.855 --> 24:50.187
Look around.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.423
I need you to consider
the possibility

24:52.425 --> 24:54.225
that there are
other explanations

24:54.227 --> 24:56.994
for the voices you hear
and the images you see.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.863
- Of course, I mean,

24:58.865 --> 25:03.267
one explanation is that I'm
completely fucking insane.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.336
- Can you hear
my thoughts right now?

25:06.439 --> 25:08.672
- Take me off the meds.

25:10.776 --> 25:13.110
- David was supportive, right?
He believed you.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.045
- Yeah, I thought so.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.717
But something was wrong.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.559
It was the baby
talking to me.

25:32.465 --> 25:35.833
I mean, I don't know how
but that's what it was.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.837
I could hear it
and see what it saw.

25:39.839 --> 25:43.841
Not just a feeling
but literally hear and see it.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.177
We were connected.

25:48.414 --> 25:50.314
- What do you think
it wanted?

25:58.324 --> 26:00.224
- To warn me.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.270
[ghostly echoes]

26:18.978 --> 26:20.744
- [Dr. Deluce]<i> Tell me</i>
<i> about the trip.</i>

26:22.481 --> 26:24.748
<i> Tell me about the incident.</i>

[whimsical music]

26:35.995 --> 26:38.362
¶¶

26:38.864 --> 26:41.265
- [Sybil]<i> He tried to keep</i>
<i> me from his family.</i>

26:41.267 --> 26:44.902
<i> He wouldn't talk about them,</i>
<i> always changing the subject.</i>

26:44.904 --> 26:48.105
<i> I'd say we should call them</i>
<i> and he refused.</i>

26:48.107 --> 26:50.541
[cellphone vibrating]
<i> I remember the day</i>
<i> I answered his phone.</i>

26:51.911 --> 26:53.177
- [Dr. Deluce]<i> You talked</i>
<i> to his parents?</i>

26:53.179 --> 26:54.345
- Hello?

26:54.346 --> 26:55.512
[Sybil]<i> They'd never</i>
<i> left the country.</i>

26:55.514 --> 26:57.181
<i> He'd been lying.</i>

26:57.183 --> 26:59.116
[over telephone]
-<i> Is this Sybil?</i>

26:59.118 --> 27:00.518
- Yes, it is.

27:00.519 --> 27:01.919
- [Dr. Deluce]<i> How did</i>
<i> you respond?</i>

27:01.921 --> 27:03.320
- [Sybil]<i> I was upset.</i>

27:03.322 --> 27:05.155
[unintelligible arguing]

27:05.157 --> 27:06.824
<i> And demanded</i>
<i> that he introduce me,</i>

27:06.826 --> 27:09.126
<i> that we were gonna have</i>
<i> a child, their grandchild.</i>

27:09.128 --> 27:11.362
[unintelligible arguing]

27:13.466 --> 27:18.335
<i> After our argument</i>
<i> David apologized.</i>

27:21.007 --> 27:23.440
<i> Said that he just wanted</i>
<i> to keep me to himself</i>

27:23.442 --> 27:25.476
<i> as long as possible.</i>

27:25.478 --> 27:27.578
<i> That he was afraid of</i>
<i> what I would think of him</i>

27:27.580 --> 27:30.080
<i> after I saw</i>
<i> where he came from,</i>

27:30.082 --> 27:31.949
<i> his family.</i>

27:33.953 --> 27:35.819
<i> Should have been</i>
<i> a red flag.</i>

27:36.822 --> 27:38.222
<i> But you let things</i>
<i> like that slide</i>

27:38.224 --> 27:40.924
<i> when you're afraid of losing</i>
<i> something you love.</i>

27:44.163 --> 27:46.430
<i> I insisted</i>
<i> that he introduce me.</i>

27:46.432 --> 27:49.266
<i> Tell me he'd drive to his</i>

[seat belts click]

28:19.432 --> 28:21.131
- Hello.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.067
Hi.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.535
- This is, uh,
this is Sybil.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.070
[laughs]

28:26.072 --> 28:28.539
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you, dear?

28:28.541 --> 28:29.573
- Good.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.208
- Hello, Father.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.279
- Sybil, my dear.
[chuckles]

28:36.348 --> 28:38.515
[Rose Holyfield laughs]

28:40.152 --> 28:42.886
You have made my son
a new man.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.022
And I can see why.
- [Rose] Yes.

28:45.024 --> 28:47.157
- You have a rare and
beautiful light in your eye.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.026
- Oh, just gorgeous.
- Just beautiful.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.061
And this.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.513
Oh.

28:52.514 --> 28:53.964
- Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.432
It's just active today.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.201
[Rose Holyfield laughs]

28:57.203 --> 29:00.070
- You have made us
so very happy, my child.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.272
So very, very happy.
- [Rose Holyfield laughs]

29:03.109 --> 29:04.341
- But I'm rambling.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.343
Let's get this
poor girl inside.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.313
- [Rose] How was the drive?

29:09.315 --> 29:11.448
- [Sybil] Oh, it was lovely...

29:23.496 --> 29:26.130
[speaking indistinctly]

29:28.234 --> 29:31.301
[family chattering
indistinctly]

29:32.371 --> 29:34.638
- The Creek Indians,
before the...

29:34.640 --> 29:36.440
I'm getting my Indians
mixed up here.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.176
The Creek are before
the Cherokees moved in.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.245
They wanted to hunt here
to take it over.
- I'm sorry.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.312
- No, it's fine.

29:42.314 --> 29:43.947
- The fighting was brutal.

29:43.949 --> 29:47.217
The rivers were said
to have, literally, run red.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.721
To this day they call
it Slaughter Gap

29:50.723 --> 29:52.723
and Blood Mountain
overlooks it.

29:52.725 --> 29:56.527
Our family were some of
the early English settlers.

29:56.529 --> 29:58.695
Always vying for position with
the Spanish and then the French

29:58.697 --> 30:04.101
but we kept our ground
and then we found gold.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.435
- Gold?

30:05.437 --> 30:07.371
- The mines are still here
right underneath us.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.640
- But, uh, what about
the Cherokee?

30:09.642 --> 30:12.309
- Well, they didn't
do so well.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.145
- Oh, the Trail of Tears,
I guess.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.381
- And that's enough of
the history lesson today.

30:17.383 --> 30:20.217
Sybil, please, tell me
about your pregnancy.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.585
How are you feeling?

30:21.587 --> 30:23.620
- Hot.
Some morning sickness,

30:23.622 --> 30:26.323
fainting spells
but nothing really--
- Wait.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.025
Fainting spells?

30:28.027 --> 30:30.027
- I mean, I guess
you could call them that.

30:30.029 --> 30:33.297
Blackouts, really,
but nothing serious.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.598
I just...

30:34.600 --> 30:37.067
need to pace myself
sometimes.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.270
Whoo.
- Are you okay?

30:40.272 --> 30:44.241
- Hmm, yeah, it's just
really moving around.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.410
Restless, I think.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.745
- She is special.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.380
You can tell.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.117
- I'm really not.

30:54.286 --> 30:57.054
- You have a gift,
my dear.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.792
[David sighs]

31:05.331 --> 31:06.797
- I told them.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.668
- Not sure that I understand--
- I told them about you.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.737
I told them about...
about...

31:15.040 --> 31:16.406
about you.

31:16.407 --> 31:17.773
- What did you tell them
about me, David?

31:17.776 --> 31:19.176
- I asked you
to be delicate.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.644
[David and Rose arguing]
- I was delicate.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.279
- It's the only thing I said

31:22.281 --> 31:23.480
but you're making her
uncomfortable.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.965
- No, I'm not.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.449
- Nothing to be ashamed of.
- Father, please,

31:26.452 --> 31:27.584
I don't want you to...

31:27.586 --> 31:29.620
- You don't want to what,
David?!

31:36.629 --> 31:39.196
Then why did you
come here at all, hmm?

31:45.638 --> 31:47.237
- It's okay.

31:47.373 --> 31:48.505
- No, Sybil.
- It's okay.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.174
I'm glad that you told them.
- You don't understand.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.709
- Really, it's fine.

31:53.646 --> 31:55.112
This is...

31:55.114 --> 31:56.713
This is awkward.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.552
I'm glad you told them,
David.

32:02.554 --> 32:05.222
Because we're gonna
be a family
- Mm-hmm.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.624
- and I don't want
any secrets.

32:08.761 --> 32:12.829
And I also don't want you
to think that I'm crazy

32:12.831 --> 32:15.432
or be frightened by me.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.701
- [Rose Holyfield laughs]
- Us? Frightened by you?

32:17.703 --> 32:19.603
- [Rose] Of course not.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.639
- But, may I ask,
are you sure?

32:22.641 --> 32:25.409
- Oh, God. Please.
- Are you sure it's real?

32:26.245 --> 32:28.478
- Yes, I'm sure.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.582
- Wonderful.
- Just incredible.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.819
- And can you...

32:35.821 --> 32:38.155
Can you see what
we're all thinking now?
- Stop.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.589
You don't have to answer
this question.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.291
- Are you hearing
something right now?

32:41.293 --> 32:43.727
- Don't make her
feel uncomfortable.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.462
No.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.731
- No, actually.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.766
You know...

32:49.768 --> 32:52.269
I can't read David either.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.421
That...

32:54.422 --> 32:56.572
Sometimes I wonder if it's
connected to a person's

32:56.575 --> 32:59.843
chemical make-up somehow,
like, maybe their genes.

32:59.845 --> 33:02.212
I mean,
I know how to use it.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.281
And I know it works
but that is not to say

33:04.283 --> 33:08.719
that I completely understand
exactly how it works.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.655
- Well, I think it's
fascinating, dear.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.690
And you needn't be
ashamed of it,

33:13.692 --> 33:15.559
at least not with us.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.261
It makes you, you.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.664
- Your parents are great.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.566
[all laugh]

33:24.336 --> 33:26.470
David was so nervous
to take me here.

33:26.472 --> 33:28.372
I have no idea why.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.507
[Rose and William laughing]
- Oh, goodness. Me either.

33:32.378 --> 33:34.611
- I can't believe that
you guys are-- are,

33:34.613 --> 33:35.879
are so wonderful.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.714
It's amazing.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.783
- [Rose] We're just glad
you're here.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.252
- You have to wonder if more
people were able to see

33:42.254 --> 33:43.820
what you see,

33:43.822 --> 33:47.190
it would make the thing
so much easier to understand.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.760
Stronger communications.
Deeper ties.

33:49.762 --> 33:51.495
It would change everything.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.298
- [Rose] What about the dangers
of such a power.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.604
- I don't want to do this.
- Let's not make a scene,
David.

34:00.606 --> 34:01.939
- I don't wanna do this.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.273
I mean it,
I don't wanna do this.

34:03.274 --> 34:04.607
- It was a mistake.
- David, just relax,
it's no big deal.

34:04.608 --> 34:05.941
We made a mistake coming here.
I made a mistake...

34:05.944 --> 34:07.878
- Darling, what are
you talking about?

34:07.880 --> 34:11.615

- Just have a glass of wine.

- And what do you remember?

36:15.807 --> 36:18.708
The sound of their voice?
The light?

36:19.545 --> 36:20.944
Their breath?

36:22.748 --> 36:26.116
- Yes, most of that,
I suppose.

36:27.119 --> 36:29.085
It's a strong memory.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.987
If that's what
you're getting at.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.826
It was raining.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.364
I remember the rain
tickling my face.

36:43.135 --> 36:45.135
- Do you have kids?

36:47.706 --> 36:49.839
What's it like?

36:49.841 --> 36:51.508
- What's that?

36:53.545 --> 36:56.046
- Holding your baby
for the first time.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.717
- I think we should
stick with your therapy.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.120
- What's it like?

37:07.593 --> 37:09.993
- It's indescribable.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.164
- What do you remember?

37:19.671 --> 37:21.805
- He smelled sweet.

37:22.975 --> 37:25.041
Like cookie dough.

37:28.847 --> 37:31.481
- It's always the smells.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.185
Smells are our
strongest memories,

37:35.187 --> 37:37.687
don't you think?

37:43.829 --> 37:45.795
You're lucky.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.035
To have such a memory.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.711
It's not real.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.849
- I'm sorry?

38:05.851 --> 38:08.918
- Your brain
recreates that moment.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.154
Every time you remember it.

38:11.156 --> 38:14.658
You mind, literally, rebuilds
it all over again every time.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.526
Did you know that?

38:17.095 --> 38:19.195
- I did know that, yes.

38:19.197 --> 38:21.498
- So, every time you
remember your first kiss

38:21.500 --> 38:25.001
or the first time that you
held your baby it changes.

38:25.003 --> 38:28.805
It's like a painter
repainting the same scene

38:28.807 --> 38:32.742

every time from scratch.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.046
- Okay, sure.

38:36.715 --> 38:40.483
- So, your first kiss
isn't really your first kiss.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.619
It's something else.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.855
It's your brain
rebuilding it.

38:45.857 --> 38:49.826
Every time just
a little less accurate.

38:52.597 --> 38:54.698
Maybe it was raining.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.268
Maybe it wasn't.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.806
Maybe your baby did
smell like cookie dough.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.377
Maybe it didn't even exist.

39:11.550 --> 39:15.752
If you think about it too much,
you'll stop trusting yourself.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.555
You won't believe any
of your memories anymore.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.190
Nothing.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.029
But what I am telling you.

It's the truth.

[thunder rumbling]

39:32.204 --> 39:34.237

you have experienced

39:37.542 --> 39:40.643
real trauma, Sybil.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.580
Nothing is clearer to me
but what I am suggesting

39:43.582 --> 39:45.749
is that perhaps we need
to find some scenario--
- Don't patronize me.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.784
I'm telling the truth!

39:50.822 --> 39:53.590
- I think maybe we
should stop for today.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.759
- No.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.560
I want you to hear it.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.094
All of it and then I want you
to look me in the eyes

39:59.097 --> 40:02.332
and tell me
that you think I am lying!

55:42.707 --> 55:43.939

55:43.941 --> 55:45.974
and tore the IVs
out of her arm.

55:46.944 --> 55:49.111

you gotta let her leave.

55:49.113 --> 55:50.713
Excuse me.

- I'm her physician.

55:53.584 --> 55:55.551

55:55.553 --> 55:58.087
- Has it been seven hours
between rotations?

55:58.089 --> 55:59.588
Is that some kind
of a joke?

55:59.590 --> 56:00.956

down the hall.

56:00.958 --> 56:02.925
- Who prescribed
the magnesium sulphate?

56:02.927 --> 56:04.443
- Dr. Bleacher. I--

56:04.444 --> 56:05.960
- Are you trying to kill
this patient,

56:05.963 --> 56:06.979
is that what's
going on here?

56:06.980 --> 56:07.996
Because I look
at these dosages

56:07.998 --> 56:09.231
and all I can think
to myself

56:09.233 --> 56:11.200
is that you're trying
to kill her, Nurse...?

56:11.202 --> 56:12.835
- Hudson.
- Okay.

56:12.837 --> 56:14.837
This woman is coming with me,
alright?

56:14.839 --> 56:16.305
- I'm the floor manager.
What's going on?

56:16.307 --> 56:18.540
- Oh, good.
I am this woman's physician

56:18.542 --> 56:20.042
and she is leaving with me.

56:20.044 --> 56:22.077
- No, sir, I'm so sorry,
that is not possible.

56:22.079 --> 56:24.146
- I'm not gonna let her
spend one more second

56:24.148 --> 56:25.848
under this inept care,
okay?

56:25.850 --> 56:27.783
I will file the paperwork
on my way out to transfer.

56:27.785 --> 56:29.585
- I need proof
that you're a doctor.

56:29.587 --> 56:31.186
- Am I your physician?
- Yes.

56:31.188 --> 56:32.755
- Do you want me
to take you

56:32.757 --> 56:34.323
out of this hospital
immediately?

56:34.325 --> 56:35.758
- Yes.
Yes, I do.

56:35.760 --> 56:36.425
Yes.

56:36.427 --> 56:37.826
- That is patient consent.

56:37.828 --> 56:40.896
Now this woman has a history
of schizophrenia
- That being said...

56:40.898 --> 56:44.666

in here for eight hours!

56:44.668 --> 56:47.336

Go, go, go.

56:48.005 --> 56:49.772

- It's this way.
Come on.

57:02.286 --> 57:04.853
- Where are we going?
We need to go to the police.

57:06.023 --> 57:07.990
- We're not going
to the police.

57:09.860 --> 57:11.994
There's something
that you need to hear.

57:34.685 --> 57:38.987
There is a corollary
between your blood type

57:38.989 --> 57:41.089
and your abilities.

57:42.259 --> 57:44.159
You weren't the only one.

57:45.896 --> 57:48.063
Right now, I believe,

57:48.065 --> 57:50.232
that there is
a group of people

57:50.234 --> 57:53.068
and they have an enormous
amount of resources

57:53.070 --> 57:54.303
and they are very,

57:54.305 --> 57:57.206
very interested
in your blood type

57:57.208 --> 57:58.907
and the abilities
that it carries.

57:58.909 --> 58:03.312
And they are willing to kill
and kidnap to get it.

58:03.314 --> 58:08.150
Alright, now,
Katherine Warren knew this,

58:08.152 --> 58:09.985
Okay?

58:09.987 --> 58:11.920
I showed her the evidence,
alright?

58:11.922 --> 58:14.423
That's why she moved you
around from place to place.

58:14.425 --> 58:16.825
She was protecting you.

58:16.827 --> 58:19.127
You must have
picked up on this.

58:19.396 --> 58:21.697
Her death
was not an accident.

58:21.699 --> 58:22.931
They got to her.

58:22.933 --> 58:24.199
Just like they got to you

58:24.201 --> 58:27.169
and they're gonna keep
coming until it's done.

58:27.972 --> 58:30.806
Several months ago,
when you started seeing David,

58:30.808 --> 58:32.207
I dug into his background.

58:32.209 --> 58:34.376
Searched the public records
for David Holyfield

58:34.378 --> 58:36.045
and his family

58:36.046 --> 58:37.713
and I didn't find anything,
Sybil.

58:37.715 --> 58:39.381
How is that possible?

58:40.751 --> 58:42.951
Unless his identity is false.

58:42.953 --> 58:45.888
A week later they asked me
to resign at the hospital.

58:45.890 --> 58:47.856
And when I said no,
they simply fired me

58:47.858 --> 58:50.692
and the medical board
revoked my license.

58:50.694 --> 58:52.794
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

58:53.430 --> 58:54.897
Look,

58:55.933 --> 58:59.368
none of this changes
the facts, alright?

59:00.271 --> 59:01.970
You have to run.

59:03.107 --> 59:05.040
- They have my son.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.493
- You have to hide.

59:07.494 --> 59:09.945
You have to go as far from
here as you possibly can.
- I'm not gonna run!

59:14.285 --> 59:16.084
- Okay. Okay.

59:17.121 --> 59:19.421
You're right.
Alright?

59:19.423 --> 59:21.456
We'll get your baby back.

59:22.059 --> 59:24.259
But not now,
not like this.

59:24.261 --> 59:27.229
You need time to heal,
alright?

59:28.132 --> 59:30.732
You need to come up
with a strategy.

59:30.734 --> 59:33.001
Come up with a plan,
get off the grid.

59:33.003 --> 59:35.170
You know,
get off their radar.

59:35.171 --> 59:37.338
Give yourself time to collect
your strength, your wits.

59:41.812 --> 59:43.779
- Where?

59:54.158 --> 59:55.524
- What happened next?

59:56.460 --> 59:57.859
- You know what.

59:58.462 --> 1:00:00.929

that's what.

down make rational plans.

1:00:23.087 --> 1:00:25.320

the grid now then?

1:00:34.465 --> 1:00:36.031
what happened?

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:39.401
- I called his cell phone,
not a working number.

1:00:39.970 --> 1:00:41.403
Called his house.

1:00:42.072 --> 1:00:44.072

But I know what happened.

1:01:04.228 --> 1:01:06.161
Okay, now I need
to know something.

1:01:06.163 --> 1:01:07.529
- What?

1:01:07.531 --> 1:01:09.398
- Are you gonna help me?

1:01:11.368 --> 1:01:13.568
Or are you gonna
keep me in this cage?

1:01:13.971 --> 1:01:16.405
- What would you do
if you were in my position?

1:01:17.141 --> 1:01:20.108
- I would help.
- Well, actually, it's my job.

1:01:20.110 --> 1:01:21.977

that her baby was taken
by an invisible cult

1:01:41.265 --> 1:01:42.864

[bird chirps]

1:01:49.106 --> 1:01:51.139
Did you know that most patients
suffering from schizophrenia

1:01:51.141 --> 1:01:52.541
were born in the winter?

1:01:52.543 --> 1:01:54.209
Do you know that?

1:01:55.045 --> 1:01:57.145
When I learned that
I couldn't make sense of it

1:01:57.147 --> 1:02:00.148
but turns out that there is
a reasonable correlation.

1:02:00.150 --> 1:02:03.251
See that's when most
in utero infections occur,

1:02:03.253 --> 1:02:06.955
which then increases the
chance of disease in infants.

1:02:06.957 --> 1:02:09.257
We get sick in the winter more
than any other time of year

1:02:09.259 --> 1:02:11.493
and the same happens
for pregnant women

1:02:11.495 --> 1:02:14.429
and then their babies
have problems later on in life.

1:02:14.431 --> 1:02:17.899
Nothing the babies did
wrong or right,

1:02:17.901 --> 1:02:19.501
for that matter.

1:02:19.502 --> 1:02:21.102
Their mothers were just
pregnant during the winter.

1:02:21.105 --> 1:02:22.471
Plain and simple.

1:02:23.006 --> 1:02:24.673
My point is, Sybil,
this is not something

1:02:24.675 --> 1:02:27.642
that you chose
or you caused.

1:02:28.378 --> 1:02:31.279
Genetics and environment

You're not gonna believe me

The only way out of here
is if I lie

Of course I don't.
