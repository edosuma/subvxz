22:23.910 --> 22:25.678

22:30.450 --> 22:32.952

TO BE A SALOON PROPRIETOR

22:36.523 --> 22:39.726
LOOKING FOR HOSTESSES TO HIRE.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.597

USUALLY MEANT PROSTITUTE,

22:44.631 --> 22:48.935
YOU THINK THAT
HE WAS SPECIFICALLY

-YES.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.077

YOU SHOULD BE AWARE

22:58.110 --> 23:01.714
THAT JACK THE RIPPER
WAS IN LONDON, NOT HERE.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.716
MM-HMM. YES,
OF COURSE I KNOW THAT.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.719

HE WAS NEVER FOUND,

23:06.753 --> 23:08.020
HE WAS NEVER IDENTIFIED.

HE JUST STOPPED KILLING
ALL OF THE SUDDEN.

23:10.222 --> 23:14.026

BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN OR--

23:14.060 --> 23:15.995
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT NOT
BE A PSYCH MAJOR,

23:16.028 --> 23:18.765
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT JACK THE RIPPER
JUST BECAME SANE?

23:18.798 --> 23:20.500
THAT HE WAS CURED
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

23:20.533 --> 23:22.502
THAT HE WAS JUST, LIKE,
"I THINK I'M GONNA STOP

23:22.535 --> 23:25.472

AND BECOME A NORMAL GUY?"

23:25.505 --> 23:27.940

NEVER STOPPED KILLING

23:55.835 --> 23:57.637

THEY DIDN'T CATCH HIM,

23:57.670 --> 23:59.005
BUT THEY CAME CLOSE.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.673
TOO CLOSE FOR HIS COMFORT.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.009
SO, HE MOVED.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.777
HE FLED TO THE U.S.,

24:04.811 --> 24:07.480

24:21.227 --> 24:24.030
WHY WOULD HE COME
ALL THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA?

24:24.063 --> 24:25.832
IT WAS THE WILD WEST

24:25.865 --> 24:28.200
