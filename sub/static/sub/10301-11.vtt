01:18.440 --> 01:21.671
She has no idea what she does to us.

01:21.880 --> 01:25.668
She's the hottest babe at this,
or any, bank.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.633
I seem to have a run
in my stocking.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.993
That's right, want me.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.510
Dream on, teller boys.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.355
If that's for me, baby,
put a little gravy on it...

01:57.560 --> 02:00.950
...and I'll take it home,
because it looks finger-licking good.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.792
This is a bank, Bud...

02:06.000 --> 02:08.354
...not a sex shop.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.717
<i>So besides saving you the cost
of renting Basic Instinct...</i>

02:16.000 --> 02:17.069
...what can I do for you?

02:17.280 --> 02:22.957
<i>Well, other than saving you the cost
of renting Lethal Weapon...</i>

02:24.920 --> 02:26.512
...you can cash this.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.320
Twenty-five thousand dollars?

02:30.520 --> 02:33.910
What could you possibly do
that would be worth $25,000?

02:39.280 --> 02:41.191
What's that on your chin?

02:41.400 --> 02:45.439
Have some of the stronger boys been
rubbing your face in the dirt again?

02:45.960 --> 02:47.871
It's called a beard.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.548
Surely you've seen one before
in the mirror.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.954
Anyhow, it's part of my new
Ivy League image.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.515
That cheque is a grant
from the Ridenaur Foundation.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.474
I'm going all the way, all expenses
paid, to Tremaine University.

03:05.680 --> 03:10.117
So because you've been a good girl,
I'll give you one final butt flex...

03:14.480 --> 03:18.314
...and you can cash that.
And make it snappy.

03:18.520 --> 03:23.071
- I've got cheques to write.
- Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.316
There are certain channels
we must go through.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.796
First we must process the cheque,
then there's a waiting period, and-

03:29.000 --> 03:32.072
Hey, baby.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.078
Just got done
with my hair appointment.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.909
Feel it, baby, feel it. Yeah.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.793
Hey, Bud. High-five me, buddy.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.037
Oh, wait. Nails aren't dry yet.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.110
Air high-five.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.954
Oh, you got a little dirt on your chin.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.837
Look, babe, I don't have a lot of time.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.429
I've only got about 20 minutes
till my massage.

04:00.640 --> 04:06.317
So should we pop into the vault and
do the deed on the deeds, if you will?

04:07.120 --> 04:11.716
Mrs. D'Arcy, before you perform
geriatric love gymnastics...

04:11.920 --> 04:14.275
...I'd like to talk to you
about clearing my cheque.

04:14.480 --> 04:18.995
All this business talk
is making me lose my edge, baby.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.589
It's cleared. Here.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.030
Here's a chequebook. Here's a pen.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.391
That's still not a beard. Goodbye.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.919
Hey, baby. Wanna go to lunch?

04:39.680 --> 04:42.558
Did someone rub your face
in the dirt?

04:43.720 --> 04:45.597
It's a beard.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.915
You like the way it goes
with my chequebook?

04:50.120 --> 04:53.271
Oh, sexy.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.233
Yeah, and I love you for your mind.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.792
Let's go.

05:03.880 --> 05:08.431
I'm sorry, sir, but you can visit
your wife's ashes in 20 minutes.

05:08.640 --> 05:12.599
Why don't you just keep her
under the mattress like normal people.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.469
They won't let me see my wife.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.592
Well, take a look at mine,
that ought to cure you.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.319
You know, Peg, I feel good. I do.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.318
I promised Bud I'd keep putting money
into his college fund...

05:29.520 --> 05:31.272
...and I'm keeping my word.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.829
I'd like to deposit this, thank you.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.998
Are you depositing
the entire quarter?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.868
Do I look Japanese?

05:43.080 --> 05:45.514
I want 5 cents back, please.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.076
And give it to me in ones.

05:49.280 --> 05:53.478
You see, it's allowance day,
and we are a family of five.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.036
You know, honey,
I am so proud of you.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.390
We opened this account
when Bud was a baby...

05:58.600 --> 06:04.152
...and now 20 years later,
with one deposit, you're doubling it.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.759
Here's your receipt and your cash.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.316
Would you like a bank guard
to escort us to the car?

06:12.520 --> 06:16.115
Nah, we tip him and the valet guy,
we walk out of here with 3 cents.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.193
Hey.

06:19.840 --> 06:23.150
"Twenty-five thousand dollars
and 50 cents"?

06:23.360 --> 06:26.352
Boy, that compound interest
really mounts up.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.718
Wait a minute, Al.
Don't you get it?

06:29.920 --> 06:34.675
The bank has made a mistake
in our favour.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.273
Shut up. Now, just look normal.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.350
All right, we have got to make
a withdrawal right away...

06:45.560 --> 06:48.597
...before they find out
about their mistake.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.109
Excuse me, please.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.758
- We'd like to make a little withdrawal.
- I wanna say the number.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.349
- I wanna say the number.
- Hush.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.599
We would like to withdraw
25,000 dollars and 25 cents.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.234
Yeah, and get that 25 cents
in pennies.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.556
Not everybody can change a nickel
these days.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.953
Ain't life grand?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.995
What if the bank finds out
they made a mistake...

07:51.200 --> 07:54.909
- ... and they want all their money back?
- That's why we bought perishables.

07:56.360 --> 07:59.750
They can get it back all right,
but do they really want it?

08:02.600 --> 08:06.195
Yeah, who'd want Daddy's tuxedo back
after it's been on his body?

08:12.920 --> 08:15.115
Come and get it.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.353
But what about
our shiny new appliances?

08:21.040 --> 08:22.678
Well...

08:28.760 --> 08:30.830
Not new anymore.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.232
Now it's ours.

08:55.280 --> 08:58.272
Now it's ours forever.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.672
And so are you, pumpkin.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.033
Gee, I wonder why Buck
would miss this meal.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.116
What's going on here?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.951
Park it, boy.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.991
Come, my dear.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.872
Gee, Bud, big news.

09:50.480 --> 09:54.393
Not as big as mine.
Family, I'm moving out.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.592
I'm going to Tremaine University
and I'm gonna live on campus.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.756
I got a $25,000 grant.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.598
Peg, this run of luck is unbelievable.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.472
He got $25,000 too.
What are the odds?

10:12.880 --> 10:14.598
- Al-
- No, not now, Peg.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.633
No, my boy just got into
a bigtime college...

10:17.840 --> 10:21.435
...and time for him and his dad
to have a little talk.

10:21.640 --> 10:24.279
Personally, though, I never
wanted to talk to my dad.

10:24.480 --> 10:29.759
Well, I'm not really like a dad,
more like a cool older friend.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.392
You know, son, I know you're
always proud of your old man.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.197
You bet, Dad.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.392
Nice mashed-potato stain.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.513
Anyhow, son, now I'm proud of you.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.554
Well, you were never
a great athlete in high school...

10:55.480 --> 10:58.631
God, it must have been cold
there in my shadow.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.838
But then I thought it'd give you
more time for the chicks.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.952
Then your personality killed that.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.117
Then you brought home
report cards with all A's.

11:10.320 --> 11:15.678
I didn't say anything at the time,
but then I was truly ashamed.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.079
A boy getting all A's, you know.

11:19.320 --> 11:23.029
Boy, did I hear about that
from the boys down at the barbershop.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.470
But now, son, you're going
to a bigtime college.

11:27.680 --> 11:31.036
And you're gonna get a chance to do
something that I've only dreamed of.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.468
Make business contacts?

11:32.680 --> 11:35.274
No, who wants to hang out
with a bunch of smart little...

11:35.480 --> 11:39.155
...sexually-deprived A students,
wouldn't know a breast from a football...

11:39.360 --> 11:41.271
...because they never
touched either?

11:45.520 --> 11:47.317
You know the type
I'm talking about, son.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.715
Yeah.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.029
Anyhow, the only reason
I ever wanted to go to college...

11:58.240 --> 12:01.550
...was to experience
one good panty raid.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.037
And now you're gonna
do that for me, son.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.915
<i>But son, heed your father's advice:</i>

12:08.120 --> 12:10.680
Stay away from the big panties.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.554
You'll see enough of those
on the shower rod after you're married.

12:17.440 --> 12:20.876
Go for the little ones, boy.
Go for the little ones.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.231
Because you don't want a girl
who wears big underpants.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.317
Because a girl who wears
big underpants...

12:26.520 --> 12:29.637
...has big stuff under her pants.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.628
Thanks, Dad.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.832
If it weren't for you, I'd probably
grab the first pair I saw.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.031
Probably would have been a big one.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.153
Well, folks, normally I'd ask
where all this stuff came from...

12:51.360 --> 12:53.669
...but since I'm moving out tonight...

12:53.880 --> 12:57.475
...let's just leave that little secret
between you and the sheriff's office.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.199
I'm gonna go pack.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.437
Honey, wash your face.
You have some dirt on your chin.

13:04.520 --> 13:08.308
It's a beard. Never mind,
I'll wash my chin.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.750
The important thing is,
I feel like a grownup.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.520
I wrote a cheque for a year's deposit
on my dorm room...

13:13.720 --> 13:15.472
...and I wrote a cheque for my tuition.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.319
I bought a new wardrobe
and a few things for my dorm.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.195
Now I'm gonna take my chequebook
and go buy me a nice little car.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.516
Guys...

13:24.720 --> 13:27.473
...this is the happiest day of my life.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.996
We're all proud of you, son!

13:39.240 --> 13:41.708
I think we stole his money, Peg.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.673
Now, we agreed we love Bud too much
to tell him what we did.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.677
His cheques are bouncing
all over town...

13:51.880 --> 13:56.078
<i>...and even if he didn't see himself
on America's Most Wanted, Kelly did.</i>

13:56.280 --> 14:00.273
So it's only a matter of time before she
realizes who he is and calls the feds.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.836
Well, we just have to convince him
to quit school and come home with us.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.759
Shouldn't be too hard.
The poor guy's probably homesick.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.952
Longing for his mommy and daddy.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.158
Who are you?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.558
It's us.

14:16.760 --> 14:21.151
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry I didn't call.
Get used to it.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.552
Come on in.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.676
Jumping Jehoshaphat, what a room.

14:31.880 --> 14:36.476
Yeah. We can't let you live like this.
You better come home with us...

14:36.680 --> 14:39.558
...where at least you'll have
someone to talk to.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.914
Hi, Bud.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.998
Hi, girls. I'm sorry,
I'm not properly dressed.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.077
Just give me one sec.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.668
Bud, are you gonna introduce us
to your little friends?

15:05.880 --> 15:08.110
Nope, don't think I am.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.352
What can I do for you lovely ladies?

15:10.560 --> 15:13.677
We just wanted to tell you
we'll be in the shower right next door.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.269
So no peeking, now.

15:22.960 --> 15:26.077
Your grandpa got lost.

15:26.280 --> 15:30.319
We'll see you later,
you cute old man.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.232
See that, Peg? They think I'm cute.

15:34.440 --> 15:39.389
Yes. Honey, they must think
you're that rapper, Ice Age.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.160
And, Bud, why do you have girls
in your dorm room?

15:42.360 --> 15:45.716
Just part of my new lucky streak.
See, all the guys' dorms were full...

15:45.920 --> 15:49.071
...so they put me
in the women's dorm.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.794
Luckily they knew I was
mature enough to handle it.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.831
Excuse me one moment.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.675
That's low, son.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.792
It's too low, you'll be looking
at kneecaps. Move it up, boy.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.752
Move it up.

16:14.160 --> 16:17.869
- Al, we are here to talk to Bud.
- I am talking to Bud.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.548
Come on, boy,
make a hole for Daddy.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.828
Well, perhaps this, as well as every
other task traditionally for the male...

16:28.040 --> 16:29.268
...is up to me.

16:29.480 --> 16:33.598
What your father would say, if his
tongue wasn't stuck in that peephole...

16:33.800 --> 16:36.951
...is that we think college
is too much pressure for you.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.594
We believe that you belong
in the Army.

16:42.680 --> 16:46.116
They'll pay you and prepare you
for a nice career driving tanks...

16:46.320 --> 16:48.788
...or shining shoes.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.434
Your father never went to college
and look at him.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.910
She dropped the soap.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.108
Pick it up, baby.

17:07.400 --> 17:11.551
Got soap in my eye. Peg.
Peg, I got soap in my eye.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.316
Perhaps your father
is a bad example.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.669
Of everything.

17:16.319 --> 17:20.393
Mom, Dad, it's been more of a thrill
than you know.

17:20.599 --> 17:24.194
Now, look, Bud, if you should decide
that you wanna come home...

17:24.400 --> 17:26.391
...or not necessarily want to,
but have to...

17:26.599 --> 17:29.592
...just remember
that our door is always open.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.074
I know you're in there!

17:36.560 --> 17:38.118
Let me in!

17:42.720 --> 17:45.518
Now aren't you glad
I made you change the locks?

17:45.720 --> 17:48.234
It was genius, Peg.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.715
By the way, when do I get my key?

17:53.400 --> 17:57.109
Open up! I want your hides!

17:58.200 --> 18:02.955
<i>We got the TV on real loud in here
and we can't hear you.</i>

18:05.200 --> 18:06.872
Free pizza delivery.

18:08.480 --> 18:12.712
- That's your son, you idiot.
- But, Peg, what if you're wrong?

18:12.920 --> 18:16.708
All right, stand back! I'm coming in!

18:25.000 --> 18:28.231
- Thanks, pal.
- No problem.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.113
But next time can we start
with the helmet on?

18:34.360 --> 18:36.715
Hey, Bud, what's shaking?

18:36.920 --> 18:40.117
Come here. I think we need to chat.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.911
We're busy over here now, Bud.
It's your mother and I's quality time.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.758
Come here now!

18:50.280 --> 18:52.748
Funny thing happened to me today.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.512
I was in my dorm room studying
when a bunch of babes came in...

18:57.720 --> 19:00.757
...and invited me to my first
college pyjama party.

19:01.280 --> 19:05.319
But not just any pyjama party.
A bottoms-only pyjama party.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.030
Save your pathetic high-five.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.354
Because just as I was about to see
some Midwestern, corn-fed boobies...

19:18.120 --> 19:20.714
...I was dragged away
by the campus police.

19:20.920 --> 19:25.152
It seems that every single cheque
I wrote to the college bounced.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.430
Do you have anything to tell me?

19:28.560 --> 19:32.553
Well, it was your mother's idea.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.192
- It was your father's.
- Your mother's.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.799
- Your father's.
- Your mother's!

19:37.000 --> 19:39.878
- It was your sister's.
- It was the girl's.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.155
So you see, Bud, there's no reason
why we can't be friends.

19:45.840 --> 19:49.116
Come on, Bud. We didn't mean
to do anything wrong.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.880
We just thought we were stealing
from a bank.

19:52.080 --> 19:57.074
Yeah, it was just one of those
madcap goofs that don't hurt nobody...

19:57.280 --> 19:59.111
...except you.

19:59.360 --> 20:03.478
Yeah. Well, I'm still gonna go
to Tremaine University.

20:03.680 --> 20:08.151
I'll just live at home
and work off my $25,000 debt.

20:08.360 --> 20:11.511
The good news is, after working
for 40 or 50 years...

20:11.720 --> 20:13.915
...everything I earn will be mine.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.316
Just like your father.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.879
You're a real male Bundy now, son.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.478
Come on, Bud. At least
you're getting an education.

20:25.680 --> 20:29.389
You won't be stuck in some low-paying
waitress job like your sister.

20:29.640 --> 20:33.792
Two hundred, 300, 400...

20:34.000 --> 20:35.797
A one.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.834
I am sure glad I didn't waste my time
in high school learning the three "arfs. "

20:40.040 --> 20:43.510
You know, something,
something and "arfrithmetic. "

20:43.720 --> 20:45.915
Well, I guess education works
for some people.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.271
This guy came into the diner
who just graduated from your college...

20:49.480 --> 20:51.755
...looking for a job as a busboy.
They said no.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.793
We already had one from Harvard.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.589
- Gee, honey, I'm really proud of you.
- You're not getting any.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.678
Well, you need somebody
to help you count it.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.233
That's true.

21:03.440 --> 21:07.149
You'll need to open a bank account,
and I'll help you write cheques.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.918
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.430
The first thing you need to know is
you need two names on the account...

21:12.640 --> 21:17.077
...of people that can write cheques.
In case you forget your name.

21:18.560 --> 21:23.759
Yeah. I don't want the same thing
to happen to me that happened to Bud.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.237
Come on.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.238
Yep.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.434
You're down, aren't you, son?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.195
Well, who could blame you?

21:41.400 --> 21:43.709
What a catastrophe.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.436
Yeah, there's no coming back
from this one.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.119
It...

21:49.880 --> 21:52.519
...was your mother's fault,
by the way.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.392
And even though it wasn't my fault-

21:54.600 --> 21:57.797
And always, always, please remember
it was your mother's.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.555
I'm gonna make up for it.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.713
I'm gonna make sure, son, that you
get the real college experience.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.032
Dad.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.275
Big underpants.
