Wait. Wait. Let me just-

01:24.151 --> 01:26.597
Let's get Daddy! Everybody get Daddy!

01:26.687 --> 01:28.166
Let's get your Daddy!

01:52.879 --> 01:55.291
It's not me. It's the camera.

01:55.349 --> 01:58.330
- It's networking.
- If the camera doesn't work well...

01:58.418 --> 02:00.523
then I'm gonna take it home with me.

02:00.621 --> 02:05.764
- Oh, look at you.
- Oh, my God. Ohh!

02:07.527 --> 02:11.168
Oh, my God. I can watch them all day long.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.076
Hi, Papa.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.307
What are you thinking?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.010
That I'm happy-

02:26.079 --> 02:27.820
<i>Michael, you're on the air.</i>

02:27.914 --> 02:30.827
<i>Yeah, my kid goes to
school in Staten Island-</i>

02:30.917 --> 02:34.228
<i>They got these new hockey masks
and they shatter on impact.</i>

02:39.226 --> 02:42.935
<i>You want to sue somebody.
You sue that Knucklehead.</i>

02:44.865 --> 02:48.870
<i> Michael, Michael, Michael. They're
flushing your tax dollars down the crapper.</i>

02:48.969 --> 02:50.061
<i>What's the
matter with you?</i>

02:50.074 --> 02:51.176
They shouldn't be
making things like that.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.514
<i>! took the kid to the doctor
and the doctor told me-</i>

02:58.945 --> 03:00.947
<i>As Henry Altmann waited in traffic...</i>

03:01.014 --> 03:02.960
<i>an the way to his doctor's appointment...</i>

03:03.016 --> 03:07.226
<i>he mentally added sub-woofers
in small cars to things he hated.</i>

03:08.955 --> 03:12.061
<i>On his short list was also
dog crap, car alarms...</i>

03:12.159 --> 03:15.003

03:59.106 --> 04:02.417
What the hell?
I ask you, what the hell?

04:02.476 --> 04:05.082
That was a red light you ran!
Can't you tell red from green?

04:05.178 --> 04:07.124
You took the test, right,
when you got your driver's license?

04:07.214 --> 04:09.751
Remember that? Multiple choice,
number two pencil, dirty walls?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.261
And what does red mean?
Does it mean "go"?

04:11.318 --> 04:13.320
Does it mean slam into my car,
is that what it means?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.764
- It-It was yellow.
- Oh, yellow!

04:15.856 --> 04:18.267
Oh, yellow like your cab
or yellow like a daffodil?

04:18.325 --> 04:19.861
Like a pretty little daffodil?

04:19.926 --> 04:22.338
Does daffodil mean step on the gas
and hit my car in your country?

04:22.429 --> 04:25.501
Is that it'? ls daffodil your excuse
to fuck up my life?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.078
Destroy my tranquility?

04:29.503 --> 04:31.949
No, I am gonna get your license revoked...

04:32.038 --> 04:34.951
and have you sent back
to wherever the fuck you're from!

04:35.041 --> 04:36.748
- Racist!
- Racist?

04:36.810 --> 04:38.949
How can I be a racist?
I don't know what race you are.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.786
- Uzbek.
- Uzbek? You're right.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.657
I hate Uzbeks.
I hate them all. But particularly you!

04:43.750 --> 04:44.922
You dead.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.589
What? What did you say?

04:49.322 --> 04:52.531
You too, mother-

05:00.901 --> 05:03.279
<i>As Sharon Gill stared at
the woman and her pet-</i>

05:04.604 --> 05:07.483
<i>She was consumed with grief
over her own cat, Harold.</i>

05:09.075 --> 05:12.147
<i>Three days ago,
Harold had jumped out the window.</i>

05:14.080 --> 05:17.152
<i>Afterward, she learned that
this was not uncommon with cats.</i>

05:17.250 --> 05:21.323
<i>The fact that Harold landed an his feet
10 floors below was of little consolation.</i>

05:21.388 --> 05:23.390
Oh!

05:28.795 --> 05:31.401
<i>Sharon understood that
Harold was a trigger.</i>

05:32.399 --> 05:35.471
<i>That she was emotionally exhausted.</i>

05:41.041 --> 05:43.021
Ohh.

05:43.109 --> 05:47.182
<i>Still, caring more for a dead
cat than her sick patients...</i>

05:47.280 --> 05:50.853
<i>was clearly a case
of clinical depersonalization.</i>

05:50.951 --> 05:52.760
Open.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.127
Wider.

05:57.390 --> 05:58.869
Wider.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.237
Wider.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.404
Excuse me.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.404
<i>No one had ever mentioned this reality...</i>

06:09.502 --> 06:11.709
<i>when she was a bright,
shiny medical student.</i>

06:11.771 --> 06:13.375
Uh, Doctor?

06:13.440 --> 06:16.546
<i>When she believed she was going
to save the world one patient at a time.</i>

06:16.610 --> 06:18.146
Doctor.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.885
<i>No one told her
that care does not equal need.</i>

06:20.981 --> 06:23.894
<i>Care being finite, need being endless.</i>

06:23.984 --> 06:26.225
Doctor! Move, man. Move.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.458
<i>What care equals...</i>

06:28.555 --> 06:32.059
<i>is 15 minutes per patient.</i>

06:32.158 --> 06:34.365
- Doctor, Mrs. Fine is in 4.
- Who?

06:34.427 --> 06:36.805
Mrs. Fine! She's one of
Dr. Fielding's patients...

06:36.897 --> 06:38.399
who you're covering, remember?

06:38.465 --> 06:40.570
And we got Wong in 3
and Peterson in 9.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.807
Okay, all right.
Listen, I just need a minute.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.645
- But she's been in there over an hour!
- Uh-huh.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.014
<i>Sharon wondered, not for the first time...</i>

06:50.076 --> 06:54.252
<i>if poor, dear Harold
hadn't made the right choice.</i>

07:29.316 --> 07:30.795
Yeah, it's me.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.387
<i>Aaron there?</i>

07:34.688 --> 07:36.224
Haven't seen him.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.825
<i>Did he leave me a message?</i>

07:37.924 --> 07:39.130
Nope.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.468
Just tell him I'll be a little late
for the meeting.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.803
Mr. Altmann.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.810
I don't know when!
When I get there!

07:46.866 --> 07:49.472
The doctor will be in to see you
as soon as she can.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.311
He. Dr. Fielding is a he.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.475
Yeah, well, Dr. Fielding has been
called away, unfortunately.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.520
So Dr. Gill will be covering
his patients today.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.815
- When?
- As soon as she can. She's very busy.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.413
Now, please, put that gown on!

07:59.479 --> 08:00.981
I don't need a gown!

08:01.081 --> 08:03.425
I'm just meeting him- Her.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.846
Oh.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.506
What the hell'?
I'm asking, what the hell?

08:49.562 --> 08:51.564
I've been waiting here for over two hours.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.905
I'm very sorry, Mr. Altmann.
It's just been a bit crazy.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.344
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Gill.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.383
I want Dr. Fielding.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.951
I understand,
but he was sent away on an emergency.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.715
Emergency. Bullshit! He just wanted
to get a jump on the weekend.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.586
Sir, I was able to look over your scan-

09:05.678 --> 09:07.351
Are you even old enough
to practice medicine?

09:07.414 --> 09:09.052
Has Dr. Fielding gone over
the results with you?

09:09.149 --> 09:10.423
No.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.792
No, as in he hasn't called?

09:14.888 --> 09:18.802
He thinks it's migraines.
I have headaches, bad ones.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.873
- When did he say that?
- When I was here last.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.703
That was before the scan?

09:23.763 --> 09:24.935
Yeah.

09:28.968 --> 09:30.914
What?

09:30.970 --> 09:33.246
- Can you please sit down?
- Why?

09:33.339 --> 09:35.182
- Because I would like for you to sit.
- Why does it matter?

09:35.241 --> 09:38.279
- Because I need you to sit down.
- I need to stand.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.880
Fine, stand.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.989
The results showed a brain aneurysm.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.192
Wow.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.374
Mr. Altmann...

09:59.466 --> 10:01.309
do you know what a brain aneurysm is?

10:02.402 --> 10:04.109
My uncle died of one.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.378
One minute he was brushing his teeth,
the next, he was dead.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.114
Didn't even have time to rinse.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.123
It's a ballooning-out
of an artery wall in the brain.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.558
- And when it pops?
- That would be a hemorrhagic stroke.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.254
And I'm dead.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.958
The seriousness depends on the size
and location of the aneurysm.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.931
How big is it?

10:25.391 --> 10:27.564
I'm an internist.
It's best if you speak to a specialist.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.334
- You have the scan right there! How big'?
- I understand.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.640
- But there's a specialist,
a neurologist at Brooklyn-

10:30.653 --> 10:31.875
- You know, right?

10:31.965 --> 10:34.309
Dr. Bernstein. I already called.
I made arrangements-

10:34.400 --> 10:36.141
What are you scared of'?
It's not your brain!

10:36.236 --> 10:37.840
Just look at the scan and tell me!

10:40.240 --> 10:42.186
It's big.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.050
And the location?

10:45.445 --> 10:47.425
Please, sir, I think it's best
that we talk to a neurologist.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.788
The location?

10:49.883 --> 10:51.590
By the brain stem.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.790
Untreatable?

10:58.591 --> 11:00.036
It's not for me to say.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.437
You already have.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.342
How long has it been there?
A long time, I'm betting.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.805
Why didn't they find it till now?

11:10.870 --> 11:13.646
Are you incompetent
or you just don't care?

11:13.706 --> 11:15.845
- That's it, you don't care, do you?
- No. No, no, no.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.082
- No what?
- No, I do care!

11:18.178 --> 11:21.216
Bullshit! You're thinking,
how inconvenient, how annoying...

11:21.314 --> 11:23.021
how difficult, how disagreeable.

11:23.082 --> 11:26.529
Poor little princess. Poor, poor you.
Well, excuse me for dying!

11:26.619 --> 11:28.895
Sir, I need you to stay calm.
It's bad for your blood pressure.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.661
- Please sit back down.
- How long do I have?

11:30.723 --> 11:32.703
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.016
No, I don't.

11:34.029 --> 11:35.296
It's all over your face
like a pinched lemon!

11:35.361 --> 11:37.864
The Lemon Princess.
You think you can hurt my feelings?

11:37.931 --> 11:41.674
You don't care, remember?
This is just a job! You don't feel this!

11:41.734 --> 11:43.873
Probably takes a diamond commercial
or a sick cat...

11:43.937 --> 11:45.780
to get some feelings out of you!

11:47.106 --> 11:49.552
Oh. Sick cats,
is that what makes you tick?

11:49.642 --> 11:52.020
That's what makes
the Lemon Princess get all wah-wah?

11:52.078 --> 11:54.388
Here I am, your sick and dying pet.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.892
Tell your fucking pet how long he has!

11:56.950 --> 11:58.327
- I don't know.
- How long?

11:58.384 --> 11:59.727
- I don't know!
- How long?

11:59.786 --> 12:01.663
- Oh. I can't breathe.
- Give me a number.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.598
A number.
Give me a number!

12:03.690 --> 12:05.670
A number, a number, a number, a number.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.535
I'm not leaving here
till I get a goddamn number!

12:08.595 --> 12:09.938
- Ninety!
- Ninety what?

12:10.029 --> 12:12.066
Minutes!

12:12.131 --> 12:15.078
- That's your professional opinion?
- Yeah.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.977
Well, fuck you!

12:17.070 --> 12:18.515
You asked.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.414
Ninety!

12:20.506 --> 12:23.043
Hey, see this watch? See it?

12:23.109 --> 12:25.589
It belonged to my father.
He lived to 90!

12:25.678 --> 12:27.157
Ninety years!

12:27.247 --> 12:29.249
You wanna know what happens
in 90 minutes?

12:29.349 --> 12:34.230
That's 6:22! 6:22 p.m.
I'm gonna be alive!

12:34.287 --> 12:36.733
I'm gonna be having a beer!
And I'm gonna be smiling!

12:36.789 --> 12:40.100
I'm gonna be smiling
because you will have been fired.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.537
That's right,
I'm calling the C.E.O. of this HMO...

12:42.595 --> 12:44.973
and getting your potty little ass canned!

12:45.965 --> 12:47.569
Dead prick!

12:47.634 --> 12:49.409
Doctor cunt!

13:18.798 --> 13:21.210
Oh, fuck me!

13:21.301 --> 13:22.473
Taxi!

13:23.870 --> 13:25.440
Yo, taxi!

13:31.144 --> 13:33.317
Downtown Brooklyn.

13:33.413 --> 13:37.156
<i>F Henry Narrating j Even though Henry
knew 90 minutes was illogical...</i>

13:37.216 --> 13:40.220
<i>the more he thought
about her prognosis, her curse...</i>

13:40.320 --> 13:42.857
<i>the more I! took on weight.</i>

13:42.955 --> 13:46.164
<i>What if? What if?</i>

13:46.225 --> 13:49.206
<i>He seemed to remember that
there were four or five stages to death.</i>

13:49.295 --> 13:51.138
What are you doing?
Drive on the sidewalk!

13:51.197 --> 13:53.006
I don't wanna die behind a cement truck!

13:53.066 --> 13:56.013
<i>Anger was certainly one of them.
Check that.</i>

13:56.069 --> 14:00.609
<i>Was not denial another?
What was he denying, the 90 minutes?</i>

14:00.673 --> 14:05.179
<i>What if he, Henry Altmann,
really was going to die at 6:22?</i>

14:05.244 --> 14:07.918
What the holy fuck should I be doing?

14:11.250 --> 14:13.196
Tell Mr. Altmann it's very important.

14:13.252 --> 14:16.495
Can you please just have him call me'?
Okay, thank you.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.929
- Is it true?
- What?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.699
- Is it true'?
- What true?

14:21.794 --> 14:24.570
Everybody's going around
saying you told some patient...

14:24.664 --> 14:27.076
that he has 90 hours to live.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.474
No!

14:28.534 --> 14:30.377
I didn't think so, 'cause that's crazy.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.574
That's-

14:32.638 --> 14:33.582
What?

14:33.673 --> 14:35.550
Nothing.

14:35.641 --> 14:37.552
- You did!
- No, I didn't!

14:37.643 --> 14:38.747
- I knew it!
- I didn't.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.223
- Everybody's saying you did!
- Jordan, be quiet!

14:41.280 --> 14:43.692
- Told a guy he had 90-
- Would you get in the room?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.571
I know! I know! He just kept yelling...

14:57.663 --> 14:59.665
Give me a number!
Give me a number! A number.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.736
And I couldn't breathe,
and I panicked and I totally lost it.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.075
Apparently.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.083
God, I- Ooh, I hated him.

15:06.139 --> 15:09.586
Well, that one I can't fault you on.
We all hate our patients.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.216
What's wrong with the guy anyway'?

15:13.279 --> 15:14.781
Cerebral aneurysm.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.752
And you let him walk out of here?

15:18.851 --> 15:21.263
- That wasn't the plan!
- Christ!

15:21.320 --> 15:23.561
I was trying to send him
to Bernstein, okay?

15:23.623 --> 15:25.296
Seriously, Christ, Sharon.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.928
I know, I know.
I'm horrible. I'm a horrible person.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.065
I have been trying to get a hold of him.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.700
I've called his cell, his home, his work,
and he just won't pick up.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.608
Why are you looking at me so funny'?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.078
What's up with your eyes right now?
Are you high?

15:37.136 --> 15:40.174
Not now. I'm serious.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.946
- For real'?
- Yeah, for real!

15:42.008 --> 15:44.147
Sharon, this is bad.
There's gonna be consequences.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.951
You could get suspended.
You could lose your license.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.890
He wasn't even my patient!

15:48.948 --> 15:51.451
He was Fielding's!
I was just covering for him!

15:51.551 --> 15:53.827
Oh, I wanna spend the weekend
with my family.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.922
I have kids. I have a life."

15:55.988 --> 15:58.298
Stupid, back-stabbing motherfucker!

15:58.357 --> 16:01.270
- I warned you.
- No, you didn't.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.136
Yes, I did.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.971
He said he was gonna get a divorce, okay'?

16:05.031 --> 16:06.908
He said that he loved me. He-

16:06.966 --> 16:08.809
Human emotion, I find it very off-putting.

16:08.901 --> 16:12.371
Let's focus on the logic.
Like the patient. What's the guy's name?

16:13.372 --> 16:15.978
Altmann. Henry Altmann.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.612
Okay, Henry Altmann.
That's a great name.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.147
That sounds like a very wholesome,
nice family man's name.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.319
I'm sure this is not the type of guy
who's gonna freak out...

16:23.382 --> 16:27.387
file complaints, just go totally nuts
on you, trying to ruin your career.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.329
Ohh.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.835
Okay, I'm getting the impression
maybe he is that type of guy.

16:32.925 --> 16:36.338
This is bad.
This is miscommunication, is what this is.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.467
I need to get him admitted
to a hospital today, for his own good...

16:39.532 --> 16:41.375
and then he's somebody else's problem.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.676
Then he's Bernstein's problem. Right?

16:45.771 --> 16:47.341
Can't hurt.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.250
I have to find Henry Altmann.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.102
A Dr. Gill has been calling for you.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.175
- Where's Aaron?
- She said it was extremely important.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.335
Where's Aaron?

17:13.398 --> 17:14.877
In the meeting.

17:16.234 --> 17:18.977
148 and 65 Charles Street.

17:19.038 --> 17:23.453
There is a six-month advance on the one
and a six-month delinquency on the other.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.215
My long-lost brother.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.656
What if you pick up
the pending violations on 148?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.215
- Garbage.
- And boiler.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.387
- I have a question.
- About the boiler'?

17:31.450 --> 17:33.930
No, I need some advice.

17:34.020 --> 17:38.400
A client, he just found out
he has 90 minutes to live.

17:38.457 --> 17:39.919
What should I
tell him to do'?

17:39.932 --> 17:41.404
Henry, we really need
to get back to this now.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.996
- I know what I would do.
- What'?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.132
Cry.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.732
For the first 20 minutes.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.903
Then I'd go to that Thai massage place
on York and get a blow-job.

17:49.001 --> 17:52.073
I'd go to Temple Israel, pray a little,
make a nice big donation.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.674
Can we get back to this now?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.583
- Me, I think I'd kill someone.
- Why?

17:56.676 --> 17:59.418
For the social good.
Some deeply evil schmuck.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.105
Like who?

18:01.118 --> 18:02.755
We live in Brooklyn.
How hard could ii be?

18:02.848 --> 18:04.418
I got a joke. Hang on a second.

18:04.483 --> 18:09.125
Man goes to see a doctor, and he's told
that he only has 10 hours to live.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.223
It's a terrible shock.
What's he gonna do?

18:11.290 --> 18:13.930
So he picks up the phone
and he calls his wife, and he says...

18:14.026 --> 18:18.338
Honey, I'm gonna take you to the Four
Seasons, the best restaurant in town...

18:18.431 --> 18:21.139
and we're gonna eat everything
on the menu.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.474
And then, we're gonna go
to the Rainbow Room...

18:23.569 --> 18:26.448
where we're gonna dance all hours,
like we were young again.

18:26.505 --> 18:31.250
And then, finally, home,
where we will make mad, passionate love...

18:31.310 --> 18:35.122
till all hours of the night,
until, at last, at dawn...

18:35.181 --> 18:37.127
I will die in your loving arms.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.890
What do you think of that?"

18:38.951 --> 18:40.760
And the wife says, easy for you.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.096
You don't have to get up in the morning."

18:47.159 --> 18:49.935
- Henry.
- What?

18:49.996 --> 18:55.070
Tell your client to go home, make love
to his wife one last time and be happy.

18:56.435 --> 18:58.642
In the end...

18:58.738 --> 19:00.615
all we have is family.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.314
Family?

19:05.378 --> 19:07.085
You're right.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.753
Family. Thanks.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.632
You're not gonna be billing us
for this crap, are you?

19:18.524 --> 19:21.334
Hey, hey, Henry, wait up!

19:21.394 --> 19:23.340
- Where you going?
- Home.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.307
You know, if you want out
of the meeting just say so...

19:25.364 --> 19:26.809
or don't show up like you always do...

19:26.866 --> 19:28.243
but this bullshit is really annoying.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.836
Is this gonna take a long time?

19:29.935 --> 19:32.040
You know, you're getting worse.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.845
You know that, right,
that you're getting worse?

19:33.939 --> 19:36.681
- I got a lotto do.
- In 90 minutes?

19:36.776 --> 19:37.948
Less.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.182
Family?

19:39.245 --> 19:40.781
Yeah, family.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.850
So, what, brothers don't count?
Because we got a lot of work to do.

19:43.949 --> 19:46.555
I'm thinking, you know, immediate family.
Like Bette, Tommy.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.189
What?

19:50.256 --> 19:54.363
Well, uh, come on, Henry.
Bette and Tommy?

19:54.427 --> 19:57.203
You and Bette have done nothing
but fight for two years. And Tommy?

19:57.263 --> 19:58.833
What do you know about family, Aaron?

19:58.898 --> 20:00.536
The only family you've got is a goldfish.

20:00.599 --> 20:04.240
I know your family, your immediate family.

20:04.336 --> 20:07.909
Reconciliation in 90 minutes?

20:11.243 --> 20:13.223
Take the Thai blowjobs.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.051
- Ah! Okay.
- Yeah.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.720
- I love you.
- Okay.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.462
- See you around.
- You're still crazy.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.590
On. Hey!

20:50.649 --> 20:52.492
Where are you?

20:52.585 --> 20:55.088
I'm trying to hail a cab.
I'm going to his office.

20:55.187 --> 20:58.100
Look, I pulled the guy's file.
He complains about everything.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.501
He's a complete crackpot,
limited credibility, to say the least.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.268
Now, do you want the big news?

21:04.330 --> 21:08.107
<i>- Yeah.
- I had Gary in Radiology
take a look at the scans.</i>

21:08.200 --> 21:12.478
Turns out, this guy's already
got bleeding through the wall.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.676
He actually could drop dead
at any second.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.049
<i>He could also live long enough to...</i>

21:18.110 --> 21:19.680
end your career, destroy your life...

21:19.779 --> 21:22.350
and enjoy a splendid holiday in Tuscany.

21:24.483 --> 21:26.053
Fabulous.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.156
I'm throwing a get-together
for the following people-

21:29.255 --> 21:32.236
Frieda Minkle, she was my first crush.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.635
Mrs. Haberstein, my third grade teacher.

21:34.693 --> 21:37.173
<i>Thomas Friel,
he was my law school mentor.</i>

21:37.263 --> 21:40.767
Bix Field, my oldest friend. I sent
you an e-mail with the complete list.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.313
Yeah, I got it. Twenty-five people?

21:43.369 --> 21:45.440
Is this some sort of post-midlife crisis?

21:45.504 --> 21:47.142
No, it's more like a pre-shiva.

21:47.239 --> 21:51.483
Just tell them it's extremely, extremely
important to meet me at Juniors in...

21:51.544 --> 21:52.818
30 minutes.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.358
<i>- You know that's insane?
- Just-Just gel it done.</i>

22:03.122 --> 22:04.465
Write obit.

22:05.724 --> 22:06.930
Get drunk.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.934
Tommy.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.840
Four years at Andover.
Four years at Penn.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.674
Three years at NYU.

22:15.734 --> 22:20.012
<i>$428,000 so you could fox-trot,
so you could mambo?</i>

22:20.105 --> 22:21.880
Yeah, and who taught me to love dancing?

22:21.974 --> 22:24.352
I love bagels! Doesn't mean
you should be a bagel maker!

22:24.410 --> 22:27.016
- So this is funny to you.
- No! And you know it isn't!

22:27.112 --> 22:30.059
What I know is
if I don't do this now, I never will.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.322
I had a thousand of these printed.

22:32.384 --> 22:34.830
Look, Altmann, Altmann and Altmann."

22:34.887 --> 22:36.867
Not Altmann, Altmann and Dancing Boy"!

22:36.956 --> 22:38.833
Not Altmann, Altmann and Twinkle Toes"!

22:38.891 --> 22:42.600
You printed those for Peter.
You didn't print them for me.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.508
I'm not Peter, Dad.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.222
Good luck ruining your life!

23:26.171 --> 23:28.742
<i>Brooklyn Dance Academy, dancing that
anyone can learn. Can you hold please?</i>

23:28.807 --> 23:31.754
Uh- Shit.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.492
<i>Brooklyn Dance Academy,
dancing that anyone can learn. Hold please.</i>

23:36.582 --> 23:39.188
<i>- Yeah- Goddamn it.
- If</i>

23:41.654 --> 23:44.032
Brooklyn Dance Academy, dancing that
anyone can learn. How can I help you?

23:44.089 --> 23:46.933
<i>- Yes! ls Thomas Altmann there?
- Who may I say is calling?</i>

23:47.026 --> 23:48.664
Henry Altmann.

24:11.917 --> 24:15.296
Tom, uh, Henry Altmann is on the phone.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.832
Shit. Sorry.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.467
God. From the kicks.

24:20.526 --> 24:22.096
What's he want?

24:22.161 --> 24:25.074
Probably wants me
to pay him back for law school.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.337
Aren't you curious?

24:27.433 --> 24:32.075
Whatever my father wants,
it can wait till we get back from Paris.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.777
- Tom.
- Take a message!

24:38.310 --> 24:39.618
Again.

24:56.895 --> 24:59.432
In 30 minutes or less.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.909
At Juniors.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.377
No, I don't know.

25:06.672 --> 25:10.347
If you could just pass on the message.
Thank you.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.513
Turn and push.

25:12.578 --> 25:14.148
Over there.

25:15.681 --> 25:19.026
Okay. Hi.
Um, I need to see Henry Altmann.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.825
And you are?

25:20.886 --> 25:22.524
Sharon Gill. Dr. Gill.

25:22.588 --> 25:25.296
Do you have an appointment?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.997
I don't I'm sorry, it's an emergency, so-

25:28.060 --> 25:30.836
- Sorry, but he's gone out.
- May I help you?

25:30.896 --> 25:33.604
Hi. Um, I don't know.
I need to see Henry Altmann.

25:33.699 --> 25:37.203
- I'm Henry's brother, Aaron Altmann.
- Oh. Hey.

25:37.302 --> 25:39.373
Um, I'm Dr. Gill.

25:39.471 --> 25:42.145
Pleasure. How can I be of service?

25:43.475 --> 25:45.580
Is there somewhere private we can talk?

25:47.780 --> 25:49.316
- Come on.
- Thank you.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.563
<i>Henry was fully committed...</i>

25:53.619 --> 25:56.566
<i>to make tender love
to his wife one last time.</i>

25:56.622 --> 25:58.192
<i>Bu! there were concerns.</i>

25:58.257 --> 26:01.204
<i>For one, he couldn't 't remember
the last time they'd done it.</i>

26:01.260 --> 26:03.934
<i>A year ago? Maybe more.</i>

26:04.029 --> 26:08.409
<i>Henry also wondered what was
the appropriate position for a last shtup?</i>

26:08.500 --> 26:11.037
<i>He assumed spooning must be in valved.</i>

26:11.103 --> 26:13.208
<i>Then again, he had read
that condemned prisoners...</i>

26:13.272 --> 26:16.742
<i>often asked for peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches as their last meal.</i>

26:16.809 --> 26:20.723
<i>Certainly, the missionary position
was the PB&J of sex.</i>

26:20.779 --> 26:23.817
<i>And, of course, there
was Henry's biggest concern.</i>

26:23.916 --> 26:26.260
<i>Would he be able to raise the flag at all?</i>

26:26.351 --> 26:30.390
<i>As Henry ran, he prayed,
not for a medical miracle,</i>

26:30.456 --> 26:33.437
<i>but for the sample ability to get 1? up.</i>

26:36.361 --> 26:38.136
I know I shouldn't be telling you this...

26:38.230 --> 26:40.767
and it's going against every protocol...

26:40.833 --> 26:42.779
but, um...

26:42.835 --> 26:47.409
your brother was diagnosed with a brain
aneurysm and is refusing treatment.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.986
Oh, God.

26:53.479 --> 26:54.822
Well, uh...

26:56.448 --> 26:59.019
- are you his doctor'?
- Yes.

26:59.118 --> 27:03.123
Well, no. I mean, I'm filling in
for his doctor, Dr. Fielding.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.930
And this diagnosis is definite?

27:05.991 --> 27:08.130
I'm afraid so.

27:10.829 --> 27:13.833
He- He was just here...

27:13.932 --> 27:15.468
and I was awful.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.137
You didn't know.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.614
I knew something was strange.

27:19.671 --> 27:22.481
But with Henry,
there's always something sort of strange.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.417
He had a son, Peter. Great kid.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.582
Died two years ago
in a hunting accident, of all things.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.489
Henry's never been the same since.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.322
We used to have lunch together every day.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.420
He would bring
a brown paper bag in and we-

27:34.486 --> 27:36.796
Two sandwiches.
One for him, one for me.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.836
We talked about everything.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.963
And now we don't talk
about anything anymore.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.604
Wait. Ninety minutes.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.305
How can you be sure it's only 90 minutes?

27:49.368 --> 27:51.006
That's a misunderstanding.

27:51.069 --> 27:53.071
How do you misunderstand that?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.516
The important thing is
we find your brother...

27:55.607 --> 27:58.816
and get him admitted
to a hospital immediately.

27:58.877 --> 28:00.914
He went home.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.992
Bette, it's Aaron.
I'm on my way to your apartment.

28:05.050 --> 28:08.031
Call me back on my cell.
It's an emergency. Any instructions?

28:08.086 --> 28:11.533
Oh, um. Make sure that he remains calm.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.159
Nothing that raises his blood pressure.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.465
- Like?
- Anger.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.063
And you've met my brother?

28:32.678 --> 28:34.885
Henry, I thought you were working late.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.518
Frank, hi. Get out.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.722
- What's going on?
- He needs to leave!

28:39.785 --> 28:41.389
He's our neighbor!

28:41.486 --> 28:44.126
No, no. I need you alone.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.531
Why?

28:45.591 --> 28:48.800
Because we have to have sex immediately
and then cuddle.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.396
What, are you nuts?

28:50.495 --> 28:53.806
No, no. I just wanna have a moment,
a husband and wife moment.

28:53.899 --> 28:58.075
<i>It'll be a good thing, a family thing.
I don't have a lot of time.</i>

28:58.136 --> 28:59.809
- I really think I should go.
- You stay.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.384
- Go!
- You're staying!

29:01.440 --> 29:05.547
Stop that! I don't care how crazy you are,
we are not having sex.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.613
Oh, but, Bette, listen...

29:07.713 --> 29:09.750
I know the last two years
have been tough...

29:09.815 --> 29:11.886
and I didn't deal well with, you know...

29:11.950 --> 29:14.089
and I've been erratic
and often pissed off at things.

29:14.152 --> 29:15.693
You think?

29:15.706 --> 29:17.258
But it doesn't mean I've stopped
loving you in my own way.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.769
And in the end, what is there?
Family. Our family.

29:20.826 --> 29:23.102
And this is our default position,
me and you.

29:23.161 --> 29:26.108
And making love to you is my way
of telling you I know what's important.

29:26.164 --> 29:28.007
We can do it in the kitchen, if you like.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.773
What the hell is the matter with you?

29:29.835 --> 29:31.439
- Can't I make love to my wife'?
- No.

29:31.536 --> 29:33.077
Why the hell not?

29:33.090 --> 29:34.642
Because sex isn't some
magic switch you pull...

29:34.740 --> 29:37.448
just because you're feeling
a momentary twinge of guilt.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.715
- Guilt? What guilt?
- About being horrible?

29:39.778 --> 29:43.282
- Who said I was horrible?
- Oh, I thought that part was obvious.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.328
- What's he still doing here?
- I-l really-

29:45.417 --> 29:49.092
You know what? Stay!
You always were a little bit of a jerk...

29:49.154 --> 29:50.963
but you were an amusing jerk.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.629
But since Peter, you're just a jerk!

29:53.725 --> 29:55.727
I lost a son, for Christ's sake!

29:55.794 --> 29:57.330
And I didn't?

29:57.429 --> 29:59.875
You just can't honor the son we lost...

29:59.965 --> 30:02.309
and you drove away the one
we do still have!

30:02.401 --> 30:03.812
Tommy doesn't deserve that!

30:03.869 --> 30:05.439
This has nothing to do with Tommy!

30:05.504 --> 30:07.484
You never accepted his life choices!

30:07.572 --> 30:09.609
Ballroom dancing is not a life choice...

30:09.675 --> 30:11.814
it's a Tuesday night on a Fiesta cruise!

30:11.877 --> 30:13.481
- Fuck you!
- Yeah.

30:13.578 --> 30:14.937
Oh. You still want that
husband and wife moment?

30:14.950 --> 30:16.320
Maybe.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.656
Do you even remember
the last time we had sex'?

30:18.750 --> 30:20.889
- Yeah! Um-
- Well, I don't!

30:20.986 --> 30:24.957
Because I have sex all the time,
just not with you!

30:27.459 --> 30:29.803
Frank?

30:29.861 --> 30:32.671
- No way!
- Why not Frank?

30:32.764 --> 30:33.834
Duh. Standards.

30:33.899 --> 30:35.344
What standards?

30:35.434 --> 30:37.675
He's not in your league!
He's not even playing the same sport!

30:37.769 --> 30:40.443
We love each other!

30:40.505 --> 30:43.008
Oh! Puke! Ohh!

30:43.075 --> 30:45.612
He is patient, kind and here!

30:45.677 --> 30:47.850
80's a spaniel! Get a pet!

30:47.913 --> 30:49.654
I wish you were dead!

30:49.715 --> 30:53.663
- Well, it's your lucky fucking day!
- Ohh! Ohh!

30:56.688 --> 30:58.190
Tompkins and Kane.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.827
There's a big tip in it if you can
get us there in under five minutes.

31:00.892 --> 31:01.927
Not possible.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.837
Of course it's possible.
Speed, run red lights.

31:04.896 --> 31:06.375
But, no, there's no need to speed, right?

31:06.465 --> 31:09.344
- It's a medical emergency.
- We don't wanna get into an accident.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.347
They have cameras at the lights.
I would receive tickets.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.404
- How much is a ticket?
- $50.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.541
- I'll give you $100.
- $400.

31:14.639 --> 31:16.118
- Does the seat belt work?
- $175.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.380
<i>' - $300.
- " No?</i>

31:17.476 --> 31:18.511
" $200.
" $400.

31:18.577 --> 31:19.851
It's not a race. This doesn't work.

31:19.911 --> 31:20.946
- $175
- $300.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.389
" $200.
" $250.

31:22.481 --> 31:23.470
I'm a doctor.

31:23.483 --> 31:24.483
All right, there's no
need for speed, right?

31:24.549 --> 31:26.028
- Oh, my God!
- Fast, but not stupid fast.

31:26.084 --> 31:27.563
<i>- $225.
- Done.</i>

31:27.652 --> 31:29.723
- Give me your money.
- What?

31:29.821 --> 31:32.131
- I left my wallet at work.
- $225.

31:32.224 --> 31:36.229
You'll be okay.
Just charge me for the minute, come on.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.035
Just give this to me.
You just take too long.

31:38.096 --> 31:40.235
- That's a lot more than-
- Here you go.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.312
Okay, so what did we just talk about?

31:43.402 --> 31:44.904
See, this is not what we discussed!

31:44.970 --> 31:47.211
This is an emergency!

31:47.272 --> 31:49.752
I know it's an emergency,
but my life's important too!

31:49.841 --> 31:52.549
- Just go faster!
- I don't wanna die!

31:56.214 --> 31:58.592
<i>Brooklyn Dance Academy, dancing that
anyone can learn. One minute, please.</i>

31:58.683 --> 32:00.720
No! Oh, fuck!

32:23.708 --> 32:25.881
I have to go get the door.

32:59.945 --> 33:03.051
<i>Brooklyn Dance Academy, dancing that
anyone can learn. How can I help you?</i>

33:03.148 --> 33:05.526
It's Henry Altmann again.
ls Tommy there?

33:05.617 --> 33:08.826
No, I'm sorry. It's his break
and he went to go get a slice of pizza.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.160
<i>- How long?
- Till he's back?</i>

33:10.222 --> 33:11.826
- Yes.
- Hard to say.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.163
.- I really couldn't.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.398
Try! Listen to me, ballerina boy!

33:15.494 --> 33:17.974
You find Tommy,
you tell him to call me right away...

33:18.029 --> 33:20.066
or I swear, I'm coming down there,
dead or alive...

33:20.165 --> 33:22.338
and shoving that Anybody can dance tutu
down your throat!

33:23.535 --> 33:25.879
Hello? Hello.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.673
Fuck!

33:28.773 --> 33:31.344
<i>He's got issues. Yeah.</i>

33:31.409 --> 33:35.186
Oh, my God! This is-

33:37.616 --> 33:38.788
Shit!

33:38.850 --> 33:43.230
Okay. Thank you. Oh.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.801
Are you always this passionate
about your work?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.111
- Hi, Bette.
- Oh, Aaron, thank God you're here.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.049
This is Dr. Gill. Dr. Gill, Bette.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.587
- Your fucking brother-
- Sharon.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.987
She's a pretty one. Come in.
I've gotta talk to you.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.581
Come in! Come in!

34:30.068 --> 34:31.877
Henry, call me back as
soon as you possibly can.

34:31.889 --> 34:33.708
I've just heard
the news.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.308
Why didn't you tell me?

34:35.407 --> 34:38.081
You just went on and on about sex,
for God's sake.

34:38.143 --> 34:41.022
You know Frank
doesn't mean anything to me.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.853
I love you!

34:42.914 --> 34:46.259
<i>Sharon took in the habitat
of her difficult patient.</i>

34:46.318 --> 34:49.264
<i>The photographs of Henry's family,
in particular...</i>

34:49.321 --> 34:51.391
<i>made her want m vomit.</i>

34:51.456 --> 34:54.164
<i>Look, they said, I am a family man.</i>

34:54.259 --> 34:57.034
<i>I am a man that is capable of love.</i>

34:58.330 --> 35:02.039
<i>She reminded herself
that Hitler was also capable of love.</i>

35:02.100 --> 35:04.102
<i>At least for his dog.</i>

35:04.169 --> 35:08.345
<i>Which reminded her of
her love for her cat, Harold.</i>

35:08.440 --> 35:11.785
<i>All in all, the family photos
had the decided effect</i>

35:11.876 --> 35:14.948
<i>of making her hate Henry even more.</i>

35:15.046 --> 35:17.185
Do you have family, Dr. Gill?

35:17.282 --> 35:20.058
No. Not really.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.497
Well, Mom and Dad in Wisconsin.

35:23.588 --> 35:26.125
But, you know, divorced, married.

35:26.191 --> 35:27.966
Thrice!

35:28.059 --> 35:30.300
Thanksgivings are a mess.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.340
Guess, uh-

35:33.431 --> 35:35.468
Guess I don't know "normal".

35:37.469 --> 35:41.542
The only normal people there are
are the ones you don't know very well.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.548
Yes, Jane.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.786
No, I'm looking for Henry.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.329
No way. Really?

35:54.953 --> 35:56.626
Okay. Thanks.

35:56.688 --> 35:57.666
What?

35:57.756 --> 36:00.362
He's throwing himself a party.

36:19.944 --> 36:22.857
Whoo-hoo!

36:31.189 --> 36:32.224
Henry!

36:33.258 --> 36:34.794
<i>Henry!
Eggs?</i>

36:34.859 --> 36:37.430
I know. I know, I know.
I put on a little weight.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.566
Yeah, you're a whale.

36:39.664 --> 36:42.543
Ah, you were always a charmer.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.273
- Where are the rest?
- Rest of what?

36:44.369 --> 36:46.042
The people who are supposed to be here.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.479
Well, traffic's terrible.
How many you expecting?

36:47.492 --> 36:48.845
Twenty-five.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.410
Oh, well, hey, I'm here.

36:51.509 --> 36:55.548
Two old warriors from P.S. 20.
Go Knights.

36:55.613 --> 36:57.854
- How long has it been, like 33 years?
- Forty-three.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.395
No! What prompted it?

36:59.451 --> 37:01.727
Not that you need a reason
to call an old buddy.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.265
Not that we do, you know, call.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.891
- I'm dying.
- Right. Long as you don't need any money.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.469
Because I am broke-o.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.232
No, no, just dying.

37:09.294 --> 37:11.001
Right. Who isn't?

37:12.163 --> 37:13.198
Soon.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.735
Oh.

37:16.835 --> 37:17.870
For real?

37:17.936 --> 37:19.847
For real.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.544
'Cause I thought you were talking
metaphorically, you know?

37:22.607 --> 37:24.712
'Cause I feel like
I've been dying for years now.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.882
Brain aneurysm.
I have a brain aneurysm and-

37:29.013 --> 37:30.424
Oh, Henry.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.861
Oh, Henry, I'm sorry.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.420
Oh, buddy, that sucks.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.625
Yeah.

37:36.721 --> 37:39.201
- How much time they give you?
- Hour and a half.

37:40.625 --> 37:41.603
That's it?

37:41.659 --> 37:44.105
Apparently.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.903
And you wanted to spend it with me?

37:47.899 --> 37:50.573
I'm touched. No, I'm touched.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.672
Because old bonds are the strongest, right?

37:52.771 --> 37:55.115
- Yeah.
- And I know what you're going through...

37:55.206 --> 37:56.810
because last year I had kidney stones...

37:56.908 --> 38:00.287
and before I passed them,
I felt like I was gonna die.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.450
You know,
they say it's worse than childbirth.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.118
- You got two kids, right?
- Had.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.287
Yeah, I got your Christmas card
like 12 years ago.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.298
Oh, you looked so happy.

38:09.354 --> 38:11.698
Me'? I never had kids.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.897
But I think it was for the best
because I got to explore my passions.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.908
I'm a gamer. I'm kind of a minor
celebrity if I say so myself.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.535
Dagon they call me.
Ever hear that name, Dagon?

38:22.634 --> 38:24.477
- No. Dagon, no.
- Yeah, that's what they call me.

38:24.536 --> 38:27.107
You remember that girlfriend
that you stole from me in high school?

38:27.172 --> 38:28.913
What?

38:28.973 --> 38:31.283
Gloria.
Remember you stole Gloria from me?

38:31.342 --> 38:32.946
Who?

38:33.011 --> 38:35.491
Gloria Cameron.
Remember? Redhead.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.720
- Beautiful skin like milk.
- No.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.625
Oh, come on!
You really don't remember her?

38:39.684 --> 38:41.664

- Love.

38:41.719 --> 38:43.630
Love! How you squashed it!

38:43.688 --> 38:46.396
I tell you I'm dying
and all you can talk about is you?

38:46.491 --> 38:49.165
You and some high school crush
from 40 years ago?

38:49.260 --> 38:52.104
- I wanted to get it off my chest!
- And you had to wait till now?

38:52.163 --> 38:55.167
Not my fault it's now or never!
You really don't remember her?

38:55.266 --> 38:59.373
This is insane! I'm sorry you turned
into some lonely, pathetic fuck, Dagon!

38:59.470 --> 39:01.950
But I have to go. Fuck you!

39:02.006 --> 39:03.007
Fuck you!

39:03.107 --> 39:05.280
- No, fuck you.
- Go fuck yourself!

Uh, so, I guess I'll head back
to the office, see if he's there.

41:56.014 --> 41:59.587
Maybe he went home.
I'll go see if he's at home.

Uh, yes, Dr. Fielding.

Perhaps you would like
to take a look at those viral slides'?

42:53.638 --> 42:55.515
Do you have plans for this weekend?

42:56.941 --> 42:58.420
No. Why?

42:58.509 --> 43:00.511
What about-
What about the Friday before?

43:01.446 --> 43:03.426
Uh, why?

43:03.514 --> 43:07.257
Felicitys parents are coming into town,
and it's our anniversary...

43:07.351 --> 43:10.195
so I was wondering
if you could cover for me on Friday!

43:10.254 --> 43:11.460
Oh, Shit!

43:11.556 --> 43:16.665
Oh!

43:16.761 --> 43:19.241
I just came just now.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.777
That was stupid!

43:53.097 --> 43:56.601
Anybody here know
how to work a video camera?

43:56.667 --> 43:59.580
I used to be a studio executive.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.810
- I know video.
- Really?

44:01.873 --> 44:03.819
You know how to work this kind of camera?

44:03.875 --> 44:05.877
I owned one like it.
You trying to sell it?

44:05.977 --> 44:08.958
No, no. I need you to record me. Here.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.131
Ready to roll, boss.

44:17.588 --> 44:21.195
Tommy, by the time you see this,
I'll be dead.

44:21.292 --> 44:22.464
- Cut!
- What?

44:22.527 --> 44:23.665
How do I turn it on?

44:23.728 --> 44:25.639
Press the fucking record button!

44:25.696 --> 44:28.734
Check. And action.

44:31.969 --> 44:35.314
Tommy, I'll make this as simple as I can.

44:37.008 --> 44:41.081
I love you. That's my rock bottom.
That's my immutable.

44:42.146 --> 44:44.183
My damned and naked soul.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.193
I loved you
from the moment you were born...

44:46.284 --> 44:48.389
all red and covered in mucousy stuff...

44:48.486 --> 44:50.329
until this moment right now.

44:51.489 --> 44:54.333
They say that love is pure and generous.

44:54.392 --> 44:55.871
It's not.

44:55.927 --> 44:58.669
It's small and selfish.

44:58.729 --> 45:01.209
You know, I wanted you at the office...

45:01.299 --> 45:05.509
because I couldn't envision anything finer
than having you next to me.

45:05.570 --> 45:08.312
Altmann, Altmann and Altmann.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.181
What a dream.

45:10.241 --> 45:14.690
What you wanted, what you dreamed,
I didn't want to hear it.

45:15.947 --> 45:17.893
I was wrong.

45:17.949 --> 45:20.122
I hope you can forgive me.

45:21.652 --> 45:23.757
I pray for your happiness.

45:25.489 --> 45:27.526
Whatever swanning around you wanna do...

45:27.592 --> 45:30.766
you have my love and my blessing.

45:30.861 --> 45:34.399
I'm sorry this only came clear to me
now that I'm dying, but...

45:34.498 --> 45:36.500
that's how life rolls out.

45:36.567 --> 45:41.346
The only people who don't look back
with regret are idiots and psychopaths.

45:41.405 --> 45:44.352
And I got a lifetime of regrets, boy.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.718
Taking that clerkship in Queens?

45:46.777 --> 45:49.383
What a fool
not telling my father to fuck off!

45:49.447 --> 45:51.586
Like the old man would ever love me!

45:51.682 --> 45:55.824
Pushing your mother away.
What a ball-less coward I am.

45:57.622 --> 45:59.795
And then there's your brother.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.265
Why?

46:04.762 --> 46:07.606
Lord, why?
I mean, what kind of God?

46:07.698 --> 46:09.803
What kind of world!

46:09.900 --> 46:12.574
It's a stinking con game!

46:12.637 --> 46:15.481
You grow up being told,
'Wait for the sweets and the roses.

46:15.573 --> 46:18.315
Then they hit you with a pickax in the ear!

46:18.409 --> 46:20.616
Grief, they say you pass through it.

46:20.711 --> 46:21.917
Bullshit!

46:21.979 --> 46:24.653
They say, "Don't get angry.
Let it go. It's killing you."

46:24.749 --> 46:27.491
I say, "Fuck that!"

46:27.585 --> 46:29.622
Anger's the only thing they left me!

46:29.720 --> 46:32.997
Anger is my refuge!
It's my shield!

46:33.090 --> 46:35.001
Anger is my birthright!

46:50.741 --> 46:52.311

Slow, quick, quick, slow-

47:39.156 --> 47:40.931
There's a Berle Altmann on the phone.

47:43.094 --> 47:45.040
Hey, Mom, what's up?

47:45.096 --> 47:47.076
<i>Have you seen your father?</i>

47:47.164 --> 47:50.043
About two years ago.
He hates me, remember?

47:50.101 --> 47:52.809
<i>- Oh, he doesn't hate you.
- Well, fooled me.</i>

47:53.871 --> 47:58.718
Tommy, he's sick.
He has a brain aneurysm.

47:58.809 --> 48:00.186
<i>What?</i>

48:00.244 --> 48:03.521
<i>- Where is he?
- I don? know He-He stormed out of here.</i>

48:03.581 --> 48:05.720
What do you mean
you don't know where he is?

48:05.816 --> 48:07.489
He's not at a hospital?

48:07.551 --> 48:10.054
We're trying to find him.

48:10.121 --> 48:12.567
<i>- Shit!
- What?</i>

48:13.424 --> 48:15.131
He called me earlier.

48:15.226 --> 48:16.967
What did he say?

48:19.830 --> 48:22.538
I didn't take the call.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.943
Shit.

48:24.034 --> 48:25.911
<i>All right. Listen, sweetie.</i>

48:25.970 --> 48:28.416
If he calls again,
you find out where he is...

48:28.506 --> 48:31.146
and you let me know
as soon as possible, you understand?

48:32.576 --> 48:34.886
Is he gonna be okay?

48:34.945 --> 48:37.755
<i>I don'! know. Just cal! me.</i>

48:53.597 --> 48:57.238
<i>When Henry regained consciousness,
he learned something.</i>

48:59.437 --> 49:01.940
<i>He learned he couldn't
even tell his son he loved him...</i>

49:02.006 --> 49:04.008
<i>without boiling into rage.</i>

49:20.124 --> 49:21.330
<i>Hello?</i>

49:21.425 --> 49:24.269
Hey, Mom.
Look, I am having the worst day of my-

49:28.966 --> 49:31.446
I told you.
I'm not licensed in Wisconsin.

49:31.502 --> 49:34.813
I can't- I can't write prescriptions.

49:34.905 --> 49:38.148
Mom, Mom, Mom, please,
I just need somebody to talk to.

49:39.910 --> 49:41.981
Mom, will you please just-

49:44.515 --> 49:46.119
Okay-

49:46.183 --> 49:50.029
Okay, fine, I'll-
I'll talk to you later.

49:50.120 --> 49:52.964
<i>Then they hit you with a pickax in the ear!</i>

49:54.124 --> 49:55.660
<i>Bullshit!</i>

49:55.759 --> 49:58.672
<i>They say, "Don't get angry.
Let it go. it's killing you  I say</i>

49:58.762 --> 50:01.800
Wait! Wait!

50:01.866 --> 50:03.402
Home.

50:04.502 --> 50:06.345
- Where is he?
- Who?

50:06.403 --> 50:08.679
The man in this video, where is he?

50:08.772 --> 50:10.979
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

50:11.041 --> 50:12.987
You're doing a great job on that guy.

50:13.043 --> 50:16.616
I am not his doctor, okay?
I was just covering for somebody-

50:18.782 --> 50:20.887
You know what?
No, I am his doctor'

50:20.985 --> 50:23.158
I am 100% responsible for this man.

50:23.220 --> 50:26.064
So please just tell me where he is.

50:26.156 --> 50:29.535
He had some kind of episode,
but then he got up, walked off.

50:29.627 --> 50:32.335
Listen, where did he go?
Come on, this is important.

50:32.396 --> 50:34.876
May or may not be important to him.

50:34.965 --> 50:36.808
Certainly ain't important to me.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.869
Uh, cash. I have cash for you.

50:38.969 --> 50:41.245
Does it look like I need money?

50:43.440 --> 50:45.818
Oh, come on!
I have more. I'll go get it.

50:45.876 --> 50:48.720
What kind of doctor doesn't have money?
This ain't Toronto.

50:48.812 --> 50:52.555
Pills. Pills.
I got pills. I have, uh-

50:52.650 --> 50:55.927
I, uh, have 0.C., fluff, muff,
whatever you call it.

50:58.656 --> 50:59.862
What?

50:59.924 --> 51:03.462
I know a pill popper
when I see one. Come on.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.407
That's everything.

51:10.467 --> 51:12.674
So it's important to you.

51:15.706 --> 51:17.413
Please.

51:17.474 --> 51:22.150
You know, more than a few people have
survived jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge.

51:23.147 --> 51:25.320
All depends on how you hit the water.

51:25.416 --> 51:27.089
Wait, wait, wait.
He went to the bridge?

Now I have to jump.

53:12.423 --> 53:13.868
I'm not even over the water!

53:13.957 --> 53:15.959
- Oh, God!
- Wait. Come back.

53:16.026 --> 53:18.973
- I lied about the 90 minutes!
- I don't have a brain aneurysm?

53:19.029 --> 53:21.236
No! No! Yes! No, you have that!

53:21.331 --> 53:24.710
About the minutes, I lied!
I exaggerated, okay?

53:24.802 --> 53:27.442
You started yelling at me!
You made fun of my cat!

53:27.538 --> 53:29.142
He died!
He jumped out of the window!

53:29.206 --> 53:30.276
What?

53:30.374 --> 53:32.411
You told me
I was gonna die in 90 minutes...

53:32.509 --> 53:34.511
because your cat jumped out a window'?

53:34.578 --> 53:38.549
Everybody has a bad day!
Please, this is- this is my bad day!

53:38.615 --> 53:40.720
Bullshit!

53:40.818 --> 53:42.525
Oh, God. Oh, God.

53:42.586 --> 53:44.156
Okay-

53:44.221 --> 53:46.064
I do pills. I do too many pills.

53:46.156 --> 53:47.829
Painkillers, they make me erratic.

53:49.460 --> 53:51.565
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

53:52.629 --> 53:54.165
Oh, my God!

53:55.933 --> 53:58.880
Okay, uh, I was having a stupid affair...

53:58.936 --> 54:01.917
with your doctor, Dr. Fielding, okay?

54:03.073 --> 54:05.053
The jerk left early for the weekend...

54:05.109 --> 54:07.919
dumping all of his patients on me!

54:08.011 --> 54:10.287
And I know I wasn't very empathetic.

54:10.380 --> 54:13.918
I am an emotional hedgehog, but-

54:14.017 --> 54:16.930
Fuck! I wasn't always like this!

54:17.020 --> 54:18.966
Okay'? I used to love my patients!

54:19.056 --> 54:21.935
That is why I went into medicine!

54:22.025 --> 54:24.562
Oh, God. No, no, please!

54:24.628 --> 54:25.868
Oh, God.

54:28.398 --> 54:30.275
It all comes down to this.

54:33.103 --> 54:34.639
If you jump...

54:35.672 --> 54:38.482
both of our lives are completely...

54:39.643 --> 54:41.919
irrevocably fucked!

54:52.489 --> 54:56.232
You gave me 90 minutes.
It's not up yet.

54:57.661 --> 54:59.163
Can I please...

55:00.898 --> 55:03.777
please just take you to the hospital now'?

55:03.834 --> 55:07.976
Ninety may not mean much to you,
but it means a lotto me.

55:08.071 --> 55:10.642
It's what? it's meaningless!

55:10.707 --> 55:12.687
It made me stop...

55:14.077 --> 55:15.556
see what I've become.

55:15.646 --> 55:19.321
It's how long you bake a turkey breast!

55:29.393 --> 55:33.466
You're right.
We're both irrevocably fucked.

55:37.868 --> 55:39.108
No!

56:03.961 --> 56:05.167
No.

56:32.990 --> 56:34.230
Henry!

56:35.993 --> 56:37.233
Henry!

56:42.432 --> 56:43.638
Henry!

56:47.037 --> 56:48.539
Oh, shit! Ohh.

56:55.245 --> 56:57.486
<i>When Henry Altmann fell from the bridge...</i>

56:57.581 --> 56:59.561
<i>time had slowed.</i>

56:59.616 --> 57:03.257
<i>And it occurred to Henry
that life didn't have to be a burden...</i>

57:03.353 --> 57:06.493
<i>that life was short and fragile and unique.</i>

57:06.590 --> 57:08.092
<i>And that each hour, each minute...</i>

57:08.191 --> 57:11.604
<i>each second could have something to offer.</i>

57:11.662 --> 57:14.404
<i>Something beautiful and astounding.</i>

57:15.732 --> 57:17.370
<i>The fact ma! {his only occurred to him...</i>

57:17.434 --> 57:19.914
<i>seconds before he would
hi! the water and die...</i>

57:19.970 --> 57:23.281
<i>made him very, very angry.</i>

57:25.509 --> 57:27.045
Come on.

57:27.110 --> 57:28.282
God!

57:28.378 --> 57:30.858
Would you just come on?

57:30.948 --> 57:32.950
Oh, God! Oh, God!

57:33.050 --> 57:35.792
Holy shit! Oh, my God!

57:36.987 --> 57:38.523
Will you help me, motherfucker!

57:38.622 --> 57:40.260
Okay! Okay!

57:43.260 --> 57:47.470
Ohh. Okay, you got it. You got it.

58:21.865 --> 58:22.866
Oh.

58:22.966 --> 58:26.209
Hey, hey. Follow my finger.

58:29.473 --> 58:30.975
Do you know your name?

58:31.041 --> 58:32.645
Henry.

58:32.709 --> 58:34.711
Do you know what day it is?

58:34.811 --> 58:37.018
I've wasted so many of them.

58:38.281 --> 58:39.658
No. Do-

58:39.716 --> 58:43.027
Do you know who the president
of the United States is?

58:43.120 --> 58:46.499
Are you trying to piss me off?
'Cause I'm having a goddamn moment here.

58:47.891 --> 58:49.598
okay

59:00.937 --> 59:02.382
What time is it?

59:02.472 --> 59:04.952
It's time to get you to the hospital.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.613
- What time is it?
- Now, please don't get angry.

59:07.711 --> 59:09.713
- I need you to remain calm.
- Uh-huh.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.350
- It's not good for you to get angry.
- I know.

59:11.415 --> 59:13.156
It's not good for your health,
for your blood pressure-

59:13.216 --> 59:15.526
Would you please
just tell me what time it is?

59:15.585 --> 59:17.326
Okay. Okay.

59:19.389 --> 59:20.595
6103.

59:21.625 --> 59:23.161
Thank you.

59:24.261 --> 59:26.366
That's 19 minutes.

59:26.430 --> 59:28.910
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

59:28.965 --> 59:30.740
Gotta go see my son, Tommy.

59:30.801 --> 59:33.247
Okay. We'll call.
He can meet us at the hospital.

59:33.336 --> 59:34.406
No.

59:34.504 --> 59:36.245
What do you mean, no?
Why, no?

59:36.339 --> 59:38.114
'Cause I have to see him first.

59:38.208 --> 59:39.710
Okay, where is he?

59:39.776 --> 59:41.915
Brooklyn Dance Academy, Williamsburg.

59:41.978 --> 59:43.457
- Williamsburg?
- Yeah.

59:43.547 --> 59:45.083
Henry, come on, you can barely walk.

59:45.182 --> 59:46.718
Does it mean that much to you?

59:46.783 --> 59:48.091
Yes.

59:48.185 --> 59:51.359
Okay. Okay.

59:51.421 --> 59:53.924
I will help you get to your son.

59:53.990 --> 59:57.597
But you have to promise me
to stay calm and to not get angry.

59:57.661 --> 01:00:01.404
And afterwards,
we go directly to the hospital.

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:04.571
No drama. No complaints.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:07.248
Okay?

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.912
Come on.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.856
I got you. Okay.

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:20.551
Right there.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:23.427
Excuse us. Excuse us. Sony.

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:25.831
- Move!
- Would you just be calm!

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:28.630
- Sorry. Mazel tov.
- Thank you.

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:32.634
Oh. Taxi! Taxi!

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:34.300
No, wait!
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.432
Hey!

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:37.035
Okay. Okay, walk.

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:45.414
We're going to Williamsburg.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.148
Kent, near Metropolitan.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:09.204
- Have a good one, man.
- Yeah, you too.

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:13.076
<i>Your call has been forwarded to an
automated voice messaging system.</i>

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.616

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:27.685
Excuse me.

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:30.288
We're in an enormous hurry,
so as fast as you can.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.355
- Do you have any cash? I'm flat broke.
- Yes, some I got.

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:33.900
We'll make it worth your while.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.095
And can you also please
turn the heat on back here?

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:42.201
Is it me or is it getting colder in here?

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:46.372
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
We're not getting much heat back here.

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:50.550
Why - Why are You going so slow?

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.176
It's green. The light is green.

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:54.654
- It was yellow.
- It's green!

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.315
No, yellow.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.751
Like daffodil, yes?

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:00.884
- We gotta get out.
- What?

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:02.794
No, no, no. Nobody going nowhere.

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.491
You made my life bad.

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:09.662
You threaten me, you threaten my license,
you threaten work, and now...

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.228
now you in my cab.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:13.899
- Do you guys know each other?
- We've met.

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:15.966
- Jew.
- Goat herder.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.568
- Racist!
- Ah, you-

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:20.671
All right, all right!
Calm, calm, calm. Everybody calm.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.512
We-We can talk about this.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.552
- Talk no. Kill yes.

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:27.088
- I will kill him. He dead meat.
- Oh, you don't have the balls!

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:28.383

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:30.118
- Calm this, motherfucker!
- I'm calm!

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:35.893
Motherfucker! Now, you dead!

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.932
No, now, you dead!

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:39.558
What ls happening?

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.603
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, let's dance!

01:02:42.726 --> 01:02:44.763
Yes, we go on, motherfucker.

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:48.105
I am a board certified
doctor of internal medicine...

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:51.373
and I really don't like it
when people don't listen to me!

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.641
When I say, stay calm...

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:56.843
I... mean... calm!

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.250
Is that so damn hard to understand?

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:02.119
- No, not at all.
- Then get in the damn car!

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.859
Are we stealing this cab?

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:07.121
Do you wanna see your son by 6:22?

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:09.663
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then get in the car.

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:19.807
You don't own a car, do you?

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:22.036
No. Why?

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:29.279
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:30.647
Relax. Relax.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.310
Relax, yeah. How?

01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:34.980
You're just as bad as your brother.

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:37.025
You drove Aaron?

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:39.491
He didn't approve of the way
the cab driver was driving.

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.323
Well, he can be a bit timid.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:43.989
He sure loved me.

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:46.830
I was so lucky to have
a younger brother like that.

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.426
It's a gift.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.528
That's why I wanted two kids.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:57.338
- Did your two boys love each other'?
- I think so.

01:03:57.434 --> 01:04:00.313
- In their own way.
- Yeah?

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.008
They were very different.

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.446
L-I was an only child.

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:09.918
It must've been lonely.

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:13.858
- I didn't think so.
- Really?

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:17.253
Now how do you feel?

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:22.170
You wonder who's gonna be there
when something happens.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:25.100
Like dying.

01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:27.700
Like dying.

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:34.080
Do you see this?

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:37.276
I see it.

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:40.346
Punch it.

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:49.358
Oh, yeah!

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:51.126
- Okay. Okay-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:53.394
Calm, calm, calm, calm!

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.664
Yeah!

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:01.431
<i>I Radio Dispatcher, indistinct]</i>

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:10.551
License and registration, please.

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:13.053
Officer, I'm Dr. Sharon Gill...

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:15.680
- and this is a medical emergency-
- License and registration.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:19.215
I understand.
This is my patient, Henry Altmann.

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.057
- He needs brain surgery.
- Do you have a license?

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:23.688
No, I don't. Not on me.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.059
This your cab?

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.863
No. Yes!

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.336
Well, it's my uncle's.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:33.900
No?

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:37.777
- Yeah, I got nothing.
- I got this.

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:40.279
- What are you gonna do'?
- Tell him the truth.

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:42.111
Oh, this ought to be interesting.

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:45.642
Officer, a little over an hour ago,
this cab hit my car.

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:49.121
Then I went to the hospital and Dr. Gill
told me that I had a brain aneurysm...

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:51.352
- and I had 90 minutes to live.
- From the car accident.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:54.088
No. Then I went to my office
and this guy was telling a joke...

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:56.562
about a man having sex with his wife
one last time, and I thought...

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:59.361
Hey, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll go home and try it with mine.â

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.129
I get there and there's my wife
sitting with my neighbor.

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:03.933
Turns out they've been shtupping
the whole time and I had no idea.

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:05.666
So I get out of there
and I go to Juniors...

01:06:05.762 --> 01:06:07.104
and I invited all
these people to say

01:06:07.117 --> 01:06:08.470
good-bye to them and
only one guy shows up...

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:10.374
and he's pissed off at me
for stealing his high school sweetheart...

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.743
- who I don't even remember!
- Calm. Calm.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:16.978
So I go across the street
to buy a video camera from this nice guy.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.701
A little bit- D-D-D-D-
But still a good guy.

01:06:18.714 --> 01:06:20.385
Not the fastest
salesman.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:23.287
And I give the video camera to a homeless
guy to videotape me talking to my son.

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:25.155
And I get a little upset
because after law school...

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:27.126
he decides to be a dance instructor
rather than a lawyer.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.026
- The homeless guy?
- No, my son.

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:31.155
I had all these business cards printed up.
But what can you do?

01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:32.791
I got upset and then I passed out.

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:34.767
And when I came 10,
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.633
That's when she shows up.
She jumps in the East River.

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:38.331
She fishes me out.
That's why we're wet.

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:40.396
Then we got picked up
by the same cabbie who hit me earlier.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.977
She maces him
and that's how we got this cab.

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:47.181
- Weird, huh?
- Yeah.

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:50.081
You weren't kidding
about him needing brain surgery.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.543
No, no, no, not at all!

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:55.850
- Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:58.016
Please step out of the vehicle.

01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:01.893
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Um... hold on. Okay.

01:07:01.985 --> 01:07:04.898
Please This, uh- This is-

01:07:04.988 --> 01:07:09.664
This is the hospital.
Just ask for Dr. Jordan Reed.

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:14.040
Dr. Jordan Reed.

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:18.001
This is N.Y.P.D.

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:21.071
You know a Dr. Gill and a Mr. Altmann?

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.355
Holy shit!

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:31.387
- What hospital?
- Maimonides.

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:32.687
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:34.888
- Try to keep up.
- I will try, sir. I will try.

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:37.464
Thank you so much, Officer.

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:41.830
- You're not gonna follow him, are you'?
- Oh, fuck, no.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.733
Yes! You go, girl!

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:48.138
Whoo!

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:56.280
- Did he call?
- No.

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.686
He might not try you here again.

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:04.384
- What if he dies before I talk to him?
- Don't go there.

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:06.017
Well, I didn't take the call.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.585
It's not your fault. He's-

01:08:10.954 --> 01:08:12.490
He wasn't always.

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:18.301
Like, when I was seven,
he taught me how to play gin rummy.

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:21.273
I hated it 'cause I could never beat him.

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:24.571
So he taught me how to cheat.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:29.707
He was so big and loud and fun.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:34.616
Then Peter died.

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.524
And I left.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.265
And everything changed.

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:49.603
He used to be so affectionate.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:52.435
He was like a major hugger.

01:08:57.367 --> 01:08:59.540
Hasn't done that in a while.

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:02.447
Sweetie.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:08.517
Maybe he's calling the apartment,
or going there.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.314
Think we should wait there?

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:35.011
Well, 6:18.

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.515
Yeah.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:38.879
Go on.

01:09:40.475 --> 01:09:43.514
I gotta wipe this car down, torch it.

01:09:43.578 --> 01:09:46.787
<i>- Really?
' I Laughs 1 No. No,</i>

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:49.261
But I'll probably park it
next to a fire hydrant.

01:09:56.893 --> 01:09:58.702
- Henry.
- Yeah.

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:01.538
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:23.292
- Sharon?
- Hey.

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:25.889
Can you call Bernstein
and have him prep a room for Henry Altmann?

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:28.229
Sure.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:30.293
<i>Is everything ail right?</i>

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:35.935

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:14.406
Hey, Dad.

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:15.972
Hey, Tommy.

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.116
How you feeling?

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.689
Uh... I've been better.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.123
For now, I'm okay.

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:30.991
Remember that time on the bridge
when I was a kid?

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:33.067
- What time?
- With this?

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:36.132
No.

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:40.367
Come on, you were humming,
singing it, and-

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.999
And what?

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:46.138
We started dancing.

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.112
- Did we?
- Yeah.

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.981
Show me.

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:21.581
You're good.

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:25.014
You should do this for a living.

01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:33.424
I missed this, kiddo.

01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:57.045
What time is it?

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.746
Uh, 7:02.

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:04.788
And you will notice...

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.055
you're still alive.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.187
That's nice.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.799
Yeah, it is.

01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:17.867
Would you wanna know
when you were gonna die?

01:13:21.264 --> 01:13:22.538
No.

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.244
But if you did...

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:29.248
what would you do
if you knew how long you had?

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:36.952
I would try and figure out
how to be happy.

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:43.093
Then why don't you?

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:48.492
Maybe I will.

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:02.838
If it's all right with you,
I'm gonna close my eyes now.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.837
