14:30.582 --> 14:33.672
I'm fascinated that there's
no form of currency exchange.

14:33.715 --> 14:36.326
Our currency is reputation.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.198
An individual's wealth
is determined

14:38.241 --> 14:41.810
by their personal achievements,
not their monetary value.

14:41.854 --> 14:44.334
We decided a long time ago
that forcing people

14:44.378 --> 14:47.686
to toil relentlessly in
the pursuit of material wealth

14:47.729 --> 14:49.688
was an unnatural state

14:49.731 --> 14:51.428
for our species to exist in.

14:51.472 --> 14:54.344
So, it really is a utopia.

14:54.388 --> 14:55.737
No societal burdens.

14:55.781 --> 14:58.000
I mean, we still have, like,
in-laws and things like that,

14:58.044 --> 15:00.002
but we've come a long way.

15:00.046 --> 15:02.831
We believe
that everyone deserves

15:02.875 --> 15:04.659
a fair chance at happiness.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.966
We all do better
when we all do better.

15:08.445 --> 15:10.186
Lieutenant Keyali.

15:10.230 --> 15:11.840
I understand that

15:11.884 --> 15:15.931
your species boasts some...
impressive abilities.

15:15.975 --> 15:19.718
Could I request a demonstration,
or would that be rude?

15:19.761 --> 15:22.416
You want me to balance a ball
on my nose, is that it?

15:22.459 --> 15:23.765
[laughter]

15:23.809 --> 15:25.724
Uh, okay. Um...

15:25.767 --> 15:28.161
Is this something
you're super attached to?

15:28.204 --> 15:29.771
Uh, no, not at all.

15:38.998 --> 15:41.827
-[all gasp]
-Oh, my...

15:41.870 --> 15:44.612
goodness.

15:44.656 --> 15:47.441
You know, I got to tell you,
it's my birthday next week,

15:47.484 --> 15:49.399
and a first contact

15:49.443 --> 15:52.838
like this is the best gift
I could've possibly asked for.

15:52.881 --> 15:54.622
What?

15:54.666 --> 15:56.406
My birthday. It's next week.

15:56.450 --> 15:59.061
Bortus's, too.

15:59.105 --> 16:01.890
We are having
separate celebrations.

16:01.934 --> 16:03.849
-Prefect.
-Take them!

16:03.892 --> 16:05.502
-What the hell?
-What is this?

16:05.546 --> 16:08.070
-On your feet. Let's go.
-What the hell is going on?

16:08.114 --> 16:09.768
-Get them out of here now!
-Prefect, what the hell
are you doing?

16:09.811 --> 16:11.639
-Move!
-Check the other three.

16:11.683 --> 16:14.207
-Move it.
-Send them to processing!

16:14.250 --> 16:15.861
-Move!
-Prefect, what is
the meaning of this?

16:15.904 --> 16:18.820
You claim to be an advanced
people, and yet you bring them

16:18.864 --> 16:21.214
into our midst?
At a state dinner, no less!

16:21.257 --> 16:23.303
What have they done?!

16:23.346 --> 16:25.871
If we have offended you in
some way, you need to tell us.

16:25.914 --> 16:27.524
Watch the one with the ears.

16:27.568 --> 16:29.875
If she tries anything,
shoot the others.

16:40.712 --> 16:42.322
[cell door clangs shut]

16:42.365 --> 16:45.455
[lock buzzes]

16:45.499 --> 16:48.110
Are all first contacts
like this?

16:48.154 --> 16:50.069
Claire, what do you make of it?

16:50.112 --> 16:52.767
Captain, I've noticed
something off about this planet

16:52.811 --> 16:54.247
ever since we arrived.

16:54.290 --> 16:56.684
That C-section
that we witnessed,

16:56.728 --> 16:59.121
it was completely unnecessary
and highly dangerous

16:59.165 --> 17:01.254
for both the infant
and the mother.

17:01.297 --> 17:02.864
-MAN: Open cell.
-MAN 2: Yes, sir.

17:02.908 --> 17:04.953
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

17:08.957 --> 17:10.480
What have you done
with Kelly and Bortus?

17:10.524 --> 17:11.699
Open your mouth.

17:14.963 --> 17:16.095
-Talla.
-Put him down.

17:19.620 --> 17:22.101
Today's your lucky day.

17:22.144 --> 17:24.669
[coughing]

17:26.975 --> 17:29.282
[clears throat]

17:29.325 --> 17:32.720
It's a small extraction.
It won't be painful.

17:46.342 --> 17:47.692
[drill whirring]

18:00.835 --> 18:03.142
Next.

18:15.676 --> 18:18.984
They've been processed.
Birthdates verified.

18:19.027 --> 18:23.118
One Panaji, one Corobahn,
one Valeigh.

18:23.162 --> 18:25.773
-No other Giliacs.
-ED: I want to know

18:25.817 --> 18:28.341
what the hell is happening here,
and I want to know now.

18:28.384 --> 18:29.908
What have you done
with Kelly and Bortus?

18:29.951 --> 18:32.345
You've got a lot of nerve.

18:32.388 --> 18:35.609
Coming in here, making demands
after what you've done.

18:35.652 --> 18:38.351
What have we done? Aside from
offering you our friendship?

18:38.394 --> 18:40.788
Friendship?

18:40.832 --> 18:43.573
You brought two Giliacs
into the State Hall

18:43.617 --> 18:45.358
where they could have done
who knows

18:45.401 --> 18:47.795
what kind of damage.
They could have killed someone.

18:47.839 --> 18:51.581
Giliac.
It's an astrological sign.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.932
-What?
-Captain,

18:53.975 --> 18:56.412
this planet is governed
by astrology.

18:56.456 --> 18:57.631
What's astrology?

18:57.674 --> 19:01.069
It's an ancient
belief system that...

19:01.113 --> 19:03.898
That's the reason for all
the premature C-sections.

19:03.942 --> 19:07.597
You arrested Kelly and Bortus

19:07.641 --> 19:09.208
because of their
astrological signs?

19:09.251 --> 19:12.951
The stars don't lie, Captain.

19:12.994 --> 19:15.954
Giliacs are violent,
unpredictable.

19:15.997 --> 19:18.913
Surely you know that as well as
we do, as advanced as you are.

19:18.957 --> 19:20.436
Where have you taken them?

19:20.480 --> 19:23.178
They'll be taken to the camps,
same as all Giliacs.

19:23.222 --> 19:24.484
And what about us?

19:24.527 --> 19:29.054
Well, the extractions
have confirmed your birthdates,

19:29.097 --> 19:32.840
so you can go back to your ship.
We don't want you here.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.237
[man shouting indistinctly]

19:54.557 --> 19:55.863
MAN:
Open the gate!

20:00.259 --> 20:01.826
WOMAN:
Let's go, let's go.

20:06.134 --> 20:08.093
[lock buzzes]

20:08.136 --> 20:10.008
[man speaks indistinctly]

20:11.487 --> 20:14.142
Commander, what is this?

20:14.186 --> 20:16.318
A bad birthday.

20:16.362 --> 20:17.537
Move.

20:41.126 --> 20:42.736
Well.

20:44.956 --> 20:47.045
They told me to be prepared.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.964
Look at you.

20:53.007 --> 20:55.053
People from another world.

20:55.096 --> 20:57.490
Why have you brought us here?

20:57.533 --> 21:00.493
But still Giliac trash,
no matter where you're from.

21:00.536 --> 21:03.322
And you'll learn to obey
the rules of this camp.

21:03.365 --> 21:05.324
Look, there's obviously been
some kind of mistake.

21:05.367 --> 21:08.066
If you could just tell us
what the hell a Giliac is,

21:08.109 --> 21:10.068
maybe we can figure out
where the screwup happened.

21:10.111 --> 21:12.113
No mistake.
The order comes straight

21:12.157 --> 21:13.941
from the office
of the First Prefect.

21:13.985 --> 21:15.769
And how long do you intend
to keep us here?

21:15.812 --> 21:17.727
This is now your home.

21:17.771 --> 21:19.381
I suggest you learn to like it.

21:19.425 --> 21:20.992
We are not your prisoners!

21:21.035 --> 21:21.993
[grunting]

21:28.347 --> 21:31.350
I am an understanding man,

21:31.393 --> 21:35.180
but you won't want
to try anything like that again,

21:35.223 --> 21:37.051
unless you're tired of living.

21:42.883 --> 21:44.450
Take them to the barracks.

21:53.024 --> 21:55.417
Captain,
I understand your frustration,

21:55.461 --> 21:58.116
but extraction by force in
the midst of a first contact--

21:58.159 --> 21:59.987
no matter what
the circumstances...

22:00.031 --> 22:01.597
There's just no way in hell

22:01.641 --> 22:03.599
the admiralty is gonna give
clearance for that.

22:03.643 --> 22:05.253
Admiral, these people are nuts.

22:05.297 --> 22:06.776
Okay, Bortus and Kelly
are locked away

22:06.820 --> 22:08.126
in some internment camp

22:08.169 --> 22:10.084
just because
they got the wrong birthday.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.130
The Regorians have even
developed the technology

22:12.173 --> 22:15.220
to calculate precise age
using tooth samples.

22:15.263 --> 22:17.222
-Claire, tell him what you saw.
-Sir,

22:17.265 --> 22:20.268
these people are performing
dangerous C-sections

22:20.312 --> 22:22.227
just to ensure the babies
are born

22:22.270 --> 22:24.620
under a positive
astrological sign.

22:24.664 --> 22:27.362
They are literally
pulling infants from the womb

22:27.406 --> 22:29.799
weeks, even months early.

22:29.843 --> 22:33.151
It's more complex than what
we see as right and wrong.

22:33.194 --> 22:35.153
We're on their turf,
with their laws.

22:35.196 --> 22:36.850
Think about the trial on Moclus.

22:36.893 --> 22:38.373
What if you'd gone in and taken

22:38.417 --> 22:40.593
Commander Bortus's infant
by force?

22:40.636 --> 22:42.812
Well, some people say
we should have.

22:42.856 --> 22:46.120
Look, I want those two officers
back safely as much as you do,

22:46.164 --> 22:47.817
but to go in guns blazing

22:47.861 --> 22:49.602
24 hours
after meeting these people...

22:49.645 --> 22:51.212
We're not the Krill.

22:51.256 --> 22:53.475
You're gonna have
to find another way to do this.

22:53.519 --> 22:55.477
Perry out.

22:58.089 --> 23:00.265
Well, now
what the hell do we do?

23:00.308 --> 23:04.269
I am unclear concerning
the astrological practice.

23:04.312 --> 23:06.184
What is the methodology?

23:06.227 --> 23:09.709
It's the idea that personality
traits, behavioral tendencies,

23:09.752 --> 23:11.711
even future events
can be determined

23:11.754 --> 23:14.931
by studying the movements
of celestial bodies.

23:14.975 --> 23:18.196
That would seem
scientifically unsound.

23:18.239 --> 23:21.068
However, it would explain
the satellites in orbit.

23:21.112 --> 23:23.853
-What do you mean?
-They appear to be configured

23:23.897 --> 23:27.248
solely for astrometry-- to
measure the positions of stars,

23:27.292 --> 23:29.903
but not their spectral type
or physical properties.

23:29.946 --> 23:32.210
And yet they're advanced enough
to send a message into space.

23:32.253 --> 23:34.125
I don't get it.

23:34.168 --> 23:36.779
I want to talk to the Prefect.

23:48.704 --> 23:50.924
Looks like we're gonna

23:50.967 --> 23:53.144
wind up having
that joint birthday after all.

23:53.187 --> 23:56.451
I would gladly share a birthday
celebration back on the ship.

23:56.495 --> 23:58.105
Wow. It only took
getting arrested

23:58.149 --> 23:59.759
for you to change your mind.

24:01.500 --> 24:06.331
Well, at least people
aren't staring as much.

24:06.374 --> 24:08.333
Commander,

24:08.376 --> 24:11.118
do you think the Orvillewill be
allowed to extract us?

24:11.162 --> 24:13.381
On a first contact? No way.

24:13.425 --> 24:16.515
If Ed can't negotiate his way
out of this, we're screwed.

24:16.558 --> 24:21.694
On Moclus, there are those
who believe in Da'klaya,

24:21.737 --> 24:24.349
that one's fate is determined
by the alignment of the stars

24:24.392 --> 24:26.133
on the day of his birth.

24:26.177 --> 24:27.917
I've been thinking
the same thing.

24:27.961 --> 24:29.354
This whole thing went to hell

24:29.397 --> 24:31.138
when I told them
it was my birthday.

24:31.182 --> 24:34.359
Some Da'klaya moons are
more desirable than others.

24:34.402 --> 24:37.753
This planet appears
to share such beliefs.

24:37.797 --> 24:40.930
"Born under a bad sign"
as official state policy.

24:40.974 --> 24:42.497
UKANIA:
Please don't. Please.

24:42.541 --> 24:44.804
We're saving it in case
they cut the food rations again.

24:44.847 --> 24:46.284
-Give it to me now.
-Can't you see she's pregnant?

24:46.327 --> 24:49.504
-We need the extra food!
-I'm not talking to you.

24:49.548 --> 24:51.376
Please, please, I'm begging you,
we need the extra...

24:51.419 --> 24:52.942
-Shut up!
-KELLY: Hey!

24:52.986 --> 24:54.814
Is there a problem here?

24:54.857 --> 24:57.382
You want to make one?

24:57.425 --> 24:58.513
Give her back the food.

24:58.557 --> 25:00.298
[laughs]
Get lost, girlie.

25:00.341 --> 25:03.127
Give it back.

25:16.227 --> 25:17.880
Go away.

25:22.494 --> 25:24.191
You okay?

25:24.235 --> 25:25.845
Yeah, thanks.

25:25.888 --> 25:27.455
Thank you so much.

25:27.499 --> 25:30.197
He is a coward.
He will not return.

25:30.241 --> 25:33.374
I'm Ukania.
This is my husband Rokal.

25:33.418 --> 25:34.984
I'm Kelly, and this is Bortus.

25:35.028 --> 25:38.336
You're the Giliacs
from the stars.

25:38.379 --> 25:40.425
Yeah. Listen, is there
anything you can tell us

25:40.468 --> 25:42.601
that might help us figure out
a way out of here?

25:42.644 --> 25:44.994
There is no way out.

25:45.038 --> 25:48.607
-Escape is always possible.
-No one's ever tried.

25:48.650 --> 25:51.218
Wait, you're telling us
no one's ever tried

25:51.262 --> 25:54.221
-to get out of this place?
-Why would they?

25:54.265 --> 25:56.092
Because it's a prison.

25:56.136 --> 25:59.487
But we belong here.

25:59.531 --> 26:01.097
-What?
-UKANIA: We were all born

26:01.141 --> 26:03.230
under the sign of Giliac.

26:03.274 --> 26:06.451
Our tendencies
are inherently violent.

26:06.494 --> 26:08.017
Criminal.

26:08.061 --> 26:09.671
We're here for the good
of society.

26:09.715 --> 26:11.804
To protect them from us.

26:11.847 --> 26:14.589
You do not appear to be violent.

26:14.633 --> 26:18.071
Murderous instincts reside
within every Giliac.

26:18.114 --> 26:21.292
Either deeply buried
or on the surface.

26:21.335 --> 26:23.381
The stars don't lie.

26:28.342 --> 26:33.260
On this day,
we enter the sign of the Giliac.

26:33.304 --> 26:36.307
As always, every effort
has been made to ensure

26:36.350 --> 26:41.050
that no births occur
during this dark time.

26:41.094 --> 26:43.357
But of course, we have yet

26:43.401 --> 26:47.056
to devise a perfect system
of prevention.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.450
Any infants born
during the next 30 days

26:49.494 --> 26:53.149
are to be immediately turned
over to the state

26:53.193 --> 26:55.500
for transport to the camps.

26:55.543 --> 26:58.285
You may do so at the nearest
service center.

26:58.329 --> 27:02.420
Failure to comply will result
in severe prosecution.
