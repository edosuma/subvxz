WEBVTT

00:02.484 --> 00:03.451
- Hey.
- You get the paper?

00:03.570 --> 00:04.702
No.

00:04.822 --> 00:05.772
(Knob rattles)

00:05.892 --> 00:09.357
(Sighs and grunts)

00:09.477 --> 00:12.173
Vanessa? Again?
(Keys jangle)

00:12.293 --> 00:14.128
How do you know they're mine?

00:14.248 --> 00:16.564
'Cause your key chain
says "geologists rock"

00:16.684 --> 00:18.466
and "don't take me for granite."

00:18.586 --> 00:20.251
(Kristin) Hey. Good morning.

00:20.371 --> 00:21.321
Hey.

00:21.441 --> 00:22.391
Did you hear there was a break-in

00:22.511 --> 00:23.461
in the neighborhood last night?

00:23.581 --> 00:24.589
A break-in?

00:24.709 --> 00:25.973
You mean one of the neighbors
was rude enough

00:26.093 --> 00:29.110
not to leave their keys
in the front door?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.812
It was the Bergen's house.

00:30.932 --> 00:32.353
- The Bergens?
- Mm-hmm.

00:32.473 --> 00:33.481
That's not right.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.016
Oh, I know.
They're such nice people.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.031
No, I mean we've got better stuff.

00:37.151 --> 00:39.354
Have you ever looked--have you
ever looked in their house?

00:39.474 --> 00:42.073
The TV's from the '70s. Just
look in their window sometime.

00:42.193 --> 00:45.059
Just pretend like you're jogging.

00:47.463 --> 00:50.169
You know, I think we need
some sort of security system.

00:50.289 --> 00:52.233
We have a great security system
at this house.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.535
I've got a cabinet
full of rifles in my den

00:54.655 --> 00:57.218
and these two big guns right here.

00:57.338 --> 01:00.875
As impressed as I am
with all your various guns,

01:00.995 --> 01:03.845
I still think we need to
organize a neighborhood watch.

01:03.965 --> 01:06.013
That's a waste of time.
It's like your book club.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.516
It started off as a good idea,
but it just turned into

01:08.636 --> 01:11.941
an hour of women complaining
about their husbands.

01:12.061 --> 01:13.985
And how do you know that?

01:14.105 --> 01:16.307
'Cause nobody brings any books.

01:17.393 --> 01:19.694
We may do a little catching up.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.062
Oh, speaking of book club--

01:21.182 --> 01:23.160
all right,
you guys cannot repeat this.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.432
Promise.

01:25.484 --> 01:27.665
Who am I gonna tell?

01:27.785 --> 01:29.871
You're the only one
in the neighborhood I talk to?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.336
Mom, the gossip?

01:32.456 --> 01:34.171
Okay.
You know my friend Angie?

01:34.291 --> 01:35.443
Yeah, uh-huh.

01:35.563 --> 01:39.260
I saw her hugging a guy in a car
who was not her husband.

01:39.380 --> 01:40.882
<i>Oh, mon dieu.</i>

01:42.617 --> 01:45.016
I'm gonna go to work.

01:45.136 --> 01:47.305
And he sure looked like he was
enjoying her new boob job.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.094
You know, it's--

01:53.214 --> 01:56.514
it's rude to walk out
in the middle of a story.

01:57.538 --> 01:59.846

02:05.274 --> 02:07.079
Hey, Mikey.
How's it going?

02:07.199 --> 02:09.205
Boning up for the sales meeting
next week, huh?

02:09.326 --> 02:10.845
No, actually, I'm looking
at home security systems.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.294
There was a break-in
in my neighborhood this week.

02:13.414 --> 02:15.379
What kind of system do you have?

02:15.499 --> 02:17.485
Well, right now I've just
got a big N.R.A. Sticker

02:17.605 --> 02:19.800
in my front window.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.988
That's--that's a solid start,

02:21.108 --> 02:22.657
but you can never be
too prepared, you know?

02:22.777 --> 02:25.222
I have boat radar on my roof.

02:25.342 --> 02:27.862
Boat radar?

02:27.982 --> 02:30.144
Are you concerned at all
about radiation?

02:30.264 --> 02:33.648
Hasn't affected me a bit.

02:33.768 --> 02:37.905
You had a full head of hair
a year ago.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.641
I don't know.
That--that "E" series--

02:40.761 --> 02:42.643
that's an idea,
but I don't want to go that far.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.363
Really? All right, let me
paint you a little picture.

02:45.483 --> 02:46.614
All right.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.954
You're family's at home
playing Parcheesi,

02:49.074 --> 02:51.786
and suddenly
masked intruders burst in

02:51.906 --> 02:54.835
shouting orders in a language
they don't recognize.

02:54.955 --> 02:56.921
God almighty, Ed.

02:57.041 --> 02:58.709
All right, I'm sorry, okay--
I-I got carried away there.

02:58.829 --> 03:01.718
All right. Anyway...
They grab the little one--

03:01.838 --> 03:02.527
Ed.

03:03.589 --> 03:05.466
Okay, all right,
I take this too seriously.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.535
Look, if you're not comfortable
leaving the family,

03:07.655 --> 03:09.270
I can handle the meeting alone.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.905
Oh, really? With Frank Lippe?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.573
You know, every time
that guy comes to town,

03:12.693 --> 03:13.724
he gets the better of you

03:13.844 --> 03:15.773
and he takes you
right out to the Woodshed.

03:15.893 --> 03:18.212
Well, what am I gonna do?
That's his favorite bar.

03:19.815 --> 03:21.987
Don't worry.
I can handle myself.

03:22.107 --> 03:23.551
You can negotiate
better than anybody I know,

03:23.671 --> 03:24.785
except with Lippe

03:24.905 --> 03:26.909
that guy seems to have
some weird hold on you.

03:27.029 --> 03:28.202
That's ridiculous.

03:28.322 --> 03:29.857
Really?
Do you remember last year?

03:29.977 --> 03:33.794
(Frank and Ed laugh)

03:35.364 --> 03:36.747
(Laughs)

03:36.867 --> 03:39.000
So what do I have to do to get
you to walk away from this table

03:39.120 --> 03:41.841
with a thousand
slightly irregular tents?

03:41.961 --> 03:43.471
Whoa, slightly irregular?

03:43.591 --> 03:44.772
They put the zippers
in the wrong spot.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.971
You'd have to tunnel your way in.

03:47.091 --> 03:48.342
I'll take 2,000.

03:49.978 --> 03:52.463
And one more for my friend.

03:52.583 --> 03:55.521
Fine, one wrong decision.

03:55.641 --> 03:56.684
One?

03:56.804 --> 03:59.024
Hunting hats with antlers, huh?

03:59.144 --> 04:00.688
(Laughs)

04:01.940 --> 04:03.758
I'll take 600.

04:05.027 --> 04:07.962
Ed, a lot of good people
are gonna get shot.

04:09.131 --> 04:10.865
Yeah, Mike has
a very good point. Yeah.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.246
No deal, Frank. No deal.

04:12.366 --> 04:14.535
<i>Hey.</i>

04:14.655 --> 04:16.971
Okay, I'll--I'll take the 600.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.875
I j--I-I just can't
stay mad at the guy. Look...

04:22.444 --> 04:25.384
All right, two times.
What's the big deal?

04:25.504 --> 04:27.048
The big deal--
we got three lawsuits pending,

04:27.168 --> 04:30.167
<i>and a lot of people got shot
in this store.</i>

04:31.620 --> 04:33.287
(Groans)

04:34.690 --> 04:37.258
All right, everybody listen up.
This is the major alarm.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.231
<i>This is very important-- Mandy!</i>

04:39.351 --> 04:42.318
For just a second,
can you focus on this?

04:42.438 --> 04:44.966
This little button here
is "empty house."

04:45.086 --> 04:46.367
You press that if you're leaving.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.303
"Full house," you press
if you want to meet John Stamos.

04:52.774 --> 04:56.177
Alarms, infrared sensors,
laser beams--

04:56.297 --> 04:58.542
isn't this still America?

04:58.662 --> 05:00.648
If I get your question,
the answer is yes,

05:00.768 --> 05:01.949
this will make it more difficult

05:02.069 --> 05:04.131
for you to sneak in after curfew.

05:04.251 --> 05:07.021
So in the even of an emergency,

05:07.141 --> 05:08.489
will you have a second-in-command?

05:08.609 --> 05:10.758
And if so, could that person be me?

05:10.878 --> 05:13.098
Sweetie, that'll be your mom, right?

05:13.218 --> 05:15.096
And if she's neutralized?

05:18.767 --> 05:22.149
Does anybody have a problem with
Eve being second-in-command?

05:22.269 --> 05:23.304
(Both) Yes.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.139
Okay, all right.
You're second-in-command.

05:25.259 --> 05:26.821
(Whispers) Yes!

05:26.941 --> 05:29.110
<i>(Mike's voice) The front door's open.</i>

05:30.362 --> 05:31.712
<i>The front door is secure.</i>

05:34.650 --> 05:36.567
When did our front door
get such a sexy voice?

05:36.687 --> 05:40.020
Listen, I've added my pipes
to the voice system

05:40.140 --> 05:42.211
to calm you guys
in case there's a crisis.

05:42.331 --> 05:43.908
I think this right here is a crisis,

05:44.028 --> 05:47.091
a time when our personal
liberties are being compromised.

05:47.211 --> 05:48.509
What's with her?

05:48.629 --> 05:49.930
Well, I think Paul Revere here's

05:50.050 --> 05:53.601
worried the alarm system might
cut into her midnight rides.

05:55.303 --> 05:56.804
Well, I like the new security system.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.102
You haven't seen
the best part of this yet.

05:58.222 --> 05:59.311
Everybody come down to the basement.

05:59.431 --> 06:00.381
I got something to show you.
Come on.

06:00.501 --> 06:03.107
Just take a minute.
Come on.

06:03.227 --> 06:07.481
All right. Let me introduce
you all to... the panic room.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.780
I thought you told us
this was the bomb shelter.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.068
Which became our storage room.

06:11.188 --> 06:13.158
And briefly Mandy's make-out room.

06:13.278 --> 06:15.035
You have a baby.

06:15.155 --> 06:17.408
And briefly my make-out room.

06:17.528 --> 06:19.410
All right,
used to be the bomb shelter,

06:19.530 --> 06:21.208
now it's the panic room.

06:21.328 --> 06:22.668
Now ideally, this should be
up near the master bedroom,

06:22.788 --> 06:24.898
but that space is now occupied

06:25.018 --> 06:26.182
by a...
(Singsongy) walk-in closet.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.235
Oh, I cannot believe
you are still mad about that.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.305
I'm not mad about it.

06:29.425 --> 06:30.621
I just wonder why a couple in Denver

06:30.741 --> 06:33.137
needs a whole wall of flip-flops.

06:33.257 --> 06:35.389
Eve, show us how it works.

06:35.509 --> 06:38.045
All right, listen up.

06:39.381 --> 06:43.134
If we hear the external alarm,
we make our way here.

06:43.254 --> 06:45.803
We lock the door and call the police.

06:45.923 --> 06:46.887
Response time?

06:47.007 --> 06:48.777
92 minutes.

06:48.897 --> 06:51.906
Excellent.
It's actually 11 minutes.

06:52.026 --> 06:53.574
Wait. So when are we gonna
vote on the alarm?

06:53.694 --> 06:55.479
We don't vote-- because
my vote is still "no."

06:55.599 --> 06:58.120
Mandy, it's only gonna be on
when we're asleep.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.484
<i>(Sighs) When you're asleep.</i>

07:00.604 --> 07:02.374
Hey, what's this?

07:02.494 --> 07:03.487
Oh, my God.

07:03.607 --> 07:05.239
That is the time capsule
I made when I was 8.

07:05.359 --> 07:07.671
Dad. I thought you said
you were gonna bury this for me.

07:07.791 --> 07:10.678
I'll bury it when I bury
your grandma. I'll do that then.

07:15.283 --> 07:16.917
There's nothing in there
but scrunchies

07:17.037 --> 07:19.892
and something called
"a letter to my future self."

07:20.012 --> 07:21.989
"Dear me, if you're reading this,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.924
"I'm guessing you're now
a pony doctor

07:24.044 --> 07:26.827
or an underpaid waitress."

07:28.396 --> 07:30.064
Wait. It says that?

07:30.184 --> 07:31.445
Oh, ha ha.

07:31.565 --> 07:32.696
Okay, all right.
All right.

07:32.816 --> 07:34.702
I'm just looking
for your undivided attention

07:34.822 --> 07:36.408
for two minutes.
Please, girls.

07:36.528 --> 07:38.077
(Gasps) Oh, hey, look, a box!

07:38.197 --> 07:39.453
(Groans)

07:39.573 --> 07:42.142
Oh, photos. Dad, is this you
with a BB gun?

07:42.262 --> 07:44.028
Let me see.
It's me or my brother.

07:44.148 --> 07:45.813
That's me--studly.
Look at that.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.148
4 years old, buck naked,
with a rifle--

07:48.268 --> 07:50.631
those were the days
boys could be boys.

07:50.751 --> 07:52.536
Okay, dad. Are we done here?

07:52.656 --> 07:54.538
I suppose so,
but you know where the alarm is?

07:54.658 --> 07:56.257
Yes, yes... You know how to get
the alarm and shut the door?

07:56.377 --> 07:59.139
Did you read-- remember this?

07:59.259 --> 08:01.695
You know, we should convert this
into a fitness center.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.430
Come on.
It's a piece of history.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.562
That's why we bought the house--
had a bomb shelter in it.

08:05.682 --> 08:09.483
Remember those days in the '50s?
The Russkies, the Cold War.

08:09.603 --> 08:11.355
Remember, in school
they had you duck and cover?

08:11.475 --> 08:13.779
Like that's--
like a desk is gonna help.

08:13.899 --> 08:16.573
Just get under your desk.

08:16.693 --> 08:18.579
Nuclear war can't get through a desk.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.898
"Look out! Aah!"

08:21.018 --> 08:23.717
Remember?
You were terrified 24/7.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.666
What a great time to be alive.

08:25.786 --> 08:29.378
This is why you don't want
a neighborhood watch.

08:29.498 --> 08:31.220
<i>What does that mean?</i>

08:31.340 --> 08:33.059
Because you literally
have a bunker mentality.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.176
It's circle the wagons,
us versus them.

08:36.296 --> 08:38.679
Listen, in time of crisis,
we can only depend on us.

08:38.799 --> 08:39.833
Honey, sometimes I think

08:39.953 --> 08:41.235
the only reason you wanted a family

08:41.355 --> 08:44.351
was so you wouldn't
have to talk to anybody else.

08:44.471 --> 08:46.353
Worked out pretty well, didn't it?

08:46.473 --> 08:47.942
Why can't we do

08:48.062 --> 08:49.940
what the Stapletons did
in their neighborhood?

08:50.060 --> 08:51.812
Trim our bushes to look like animals?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.564
No. No, no, no.

08:53.684 --> 08:56.405
We--we organize
a community crime watch

08:56.525 --> 08:58.485
and have the neighbors over
to discuss it.

08:58.605 --> 08:59.742
In our house?
Yeah.

08:59.862 --> 09:03.324
Great idea--Mrs. Wong
correcting our grammar,

09:03.444 --> 09:04.925
that--that chubby guy Christopher

09:05.045 --> 09:06.415
eating everything
we got in the house...

09:06.535 --> 09:08.662
Oh. And what is the guy
with the captain's hat?

09:08.782 --> 09:11.503
The skipper--what is--
who--what is that?

09:11.623 --> 09:16.008
Why do you wear a captain's hat?
I think he's bald.

09:16.128 --> 09:18.255
Come on.
It'll just be for an hour.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.074
An hour?
That's how it starts--an hour.

09:20.194 --> 09:21.258
You got strangers in your house

09:21.378 --> 09:22.843
going through your bedroom
and your closets,

09:22.963 --> 09:24.762
rummaging through
your medicine cabinet.

09:24.882 --> 09:25.893
And how do you know that?

09:26.013 --> 09:28.249
'Cause that's what I would do.

09:29.818 --> 09:31.018
Ugh. Ugh.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.686
So that's it?
It's not even a discussion?

09:32.806 --> 09:36.945
No discussion.
I'm serious. Case closed.

09:37.065 --> 09:40.761
I want to welcome you all to my home.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:49.387 --> 09:51.304
(Vanessa) Okay. I think
we're ready to get started.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.108
You know we're 2,000 miles
away from the ocean?

09:59.597 --> 10:00.797
Mike.

10:04.569 --> 10:06.002
All right, well,
first I would like to thank

10:06.122 --> 10:09.239
everyone who, uh, showed up
tonight on a school night.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.309
Oh, my God.

10:10.429 --> 10:11.808
What?
Never mind.

10:13.044 --> 10:17.030
(Whispers) I didn't go to school today.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.182
Mike, would you like
to say a few words?

10:19.302 --> 10:21.852
I did. I said, "let's do this quick."

10:21.972 --> 10:23.920
<i>Quickly.</i>

10:25.623 --> 10:26.923
What?

10:27.043 --> 10:29.759
<i>It should be
"let's get this over quickly."</i>

10:29.879 --> 10:32.629
(Forces laugh)

10:32.749 --> 10:36.349
Um, all right. Does everyone
have pie, coffee, uh...

10:36.469 --> 10:38.301
Please, just make yourselves at home.

10:38.421 --> 10:40.937
Except in the rooms
that I'm painting...

10:41.057 --> 10:44.107
Which is the kitchen,
this whole area here, my office,

10:44.227 --> 10:46.526
the entire upstairs,
and all of the bathrooms

10:46.646 --> 10:49.696
except the one
that's marked "you can use."

10:49.816 --> 10:53.283
(Chuckles) Uh, at this time,
I would like to introduce

10:53.403 --> 10:57.420
our new neighborhood security
coordinator, Marvin Slater.

10:57.540 --> 11:01.041
Oh. (Chuckles)

11:02.243 --> 11:03.627
Thank you.

11:03.747 --> 11:07.697
Uh, actually, I prefer to be
called, uh, officer Slater.

11:08.766 --> 11:11.468
But you're not a real cop.

11:11.588 --> 11:15.272
Ah, I'm basically a cop.

11:15.392 --> 11:17.941
Your badge has a peach on it.

11:19.777 --> 11:20.944
Oh, that's what that is.

11:21.064 --> 11:22.014
(Mike and Kristin laugh)

11:22.134 --> 11:24.564
Guys. Can you stop acting badly?

11:24.684 --> 11:25.634
(Mrs. Wong) Bad.

11:27.385 --> 11:28.935
Pardon?

11:29.055 --> 11:32.522
It's "acting bad" not "badly".

11:32.642 --> 11:35.725
(Under breath)
Can you believe this woman?

11:36.727 --> 11:38.394
Now you people, uh, can help yourselves

11:38.514 --> 11:42.699
by keeping your windows closed
and--and your doors, um...

11:42.819 --> 11:44.968
Uh, your doors, uh...

11:45.088 --> 11:46.586
Locked?

11:46.706 --> 11:49.439
Uh, no. No, it's not--
it's not that. Uh...

11:49.559 --> 11:50.774
Unlocked?

11:50.894 --> 11:53.426
Yes, locked. It's "locked."

11:53.546 --> 11:54.711
Sorry.

11:54.831 --> 11:56.880
So the point is that,
uh, you know, no intruder

11:57.000 --> 12:02.519
wants to rob a neighborhood...
That... is... um...

12:04.388 --> 12:06.156
(Sighs) Uh...

12:06.276 --> 12:09.092
It's, um...

12:09.212 --> 12:10.860
Well-lit

12:10.980 --> 12:12.796
um, no, no, no. It's, uh...

12:12.916 --> 12:14.497
Vigilant?
No.

12:14.617 --> 12:15.699
Secure?
No.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.834
Safe?
Well-lit.

12:19.737 --> 12:22.172
This is great pie.

12:22.292 --> 12:24.307
(Lowered voice) Well, this guy
couldn't find a burglar.

12:24.427 --> 12:28.244
He can't find the end of a sentence.

12:28.364 --> 12:30.814
(Normal voice)
Hey, uh, Marvin? Martin?

12:30.934 --> 12:31.884
Officer-- Marvin. How you doing?

12:32.004 --> 12:33.183
Good. Great.
You know, I think--

12:33.303 --> 12:35.085
I think we got the message.
Think it's been great.

12:35.205 --> 12:36.586
Everybody--great speech...
Oh.

12:36.706 --> 12:38.338
Informative, very motivational. Okay.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.589
How about a...
Okay.

12:39.709 --> 12:41.975
How about a round of applause
for our officer?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.893
Great job. Great job.
Thanks so much.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.562
Okay, stay safe. Okay.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.797
Okay. All right.

12:47.917 --> 12:51.985
What an idiot.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.438
Honest to God, folks. Come on.
Well, we gave it a shot.

12:55.558 --> 12:57.774
We tried, we got everybody here,
you had your pie.

12:57.894 --> 13:00.510
I say put your plates down,
don't make a mess, get out,

13:00.630 --> 13:02.912
and remember, mow your lawns.
It's for everybody.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.682
No, no, no, no, no, no,
he's kidding...

13:05.802 --> 13:06.983
I'm not kidding.
He's kidding.

13:07.103 --> 13:09.919
Yes, 'cause Marvin was
about to assign watch rotation,

13:10.039 --> 13:11.121
and now you need to do that.

13:11.241 --> 13:15.175
No way. Hey.
Let's be honest.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.826
How many in this room

13:16.946 --> 13:19.896
want to pair up and walk around
in the dark together?

13:20.016 --> 13:23.033
By a show of h-hands.

13:23.153 --> 13:27.504
Come on. Nobody?

13:27.624 --> 13:28.738
- (Mike) Hey, Ed.
- (Ed) Mm.

13:28.858 --> 13:30.106
Those jackals on the loading dock

13:30.226 --> 13:31.541
got to the sandwich cart first,

13:31.661 --> 13:34.394
but I did get you
the last turkey club.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.546
All right, thanks, Mikey.
Okay, what's the damage?

13:36.666 --> 13:37.981
5 beans, buddy.

13:38.101 --> 13:39.899
All right.
I'll give you 3.

13:41.185 --> 13:44.387
What are you talking about?
5 bucks, come on.

13:44.507 --> 13:47.257
I'll give you $2.25,
not a penny more.

13:47.377 --> 13:48.558
Hey, how about this?

13:48.678 --> 13:50.760
You owe me nothing,
and I'll eat the sandwich.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.130
You eat that sandwich,
you owe me $45.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.883
Ooh. Are you on those
muscle supplements again?

13:57.003 --> 13:59.002
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

13:59.122 --> 14:01.404
I just--I'm getting pumped up
for the big fight tonight.

14:01.524 --> 14:03.256
You know, me versus Frank Lippe,

14:03.376 --> 14:05.255
the war to settle the score.
That's all.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.060
I got, uh, Lippe in the fifth,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.646
and by fifth, I mean fifth of scotch.

14:09.766 --> 14:10.914
No. No, Michael.
Michael, no, no.

14:11.034 --> 14:12.315
Not this year, no.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.518
I've been reading a few books
on the art of negotiation,

14:15.638 --> 14:16.903
and they all say the same thing.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.988
"Don't be drunk."

14:27.364 --> 14:29.415
Okay, so this one,
you have to solve for "x."

14:29.535 --> 14:31.451
How about 5?

14:31.571 --> 14:34.087
No. No, no, no.
Don't just guess. Figure it out.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.605
(Groans)

14:35.725 --> 14:38.258
Okay, wait.
So "x" can be, like, any number?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.476
Yes, it can.

14:39.596 --> 14:41.644
So what's wrong with 5?

14:41.764 --> 14:44.781
Amanda, how have you
gotten through math so far?

14:44.901 --> 14:46.599
I try. I really do.

14:46.719 --> 14:51.421
I don't know, but then I just
start feeling overwhelmed and...

14:51.541 --> 14:54.190
(Voice breaking) And then--
and then I start to panic,

14:54.310 --> 14:57.060
and then... I don't know.
I just feel like,

14:57.180 --> 14:59.996
"God, I'm gonna grow up
to be such a loser."

15:00.116 --> 15:02.632
(Sighs) The answer's 7.

15:02.752 --> 15:06.803
<i>And that's how I've been
getting through math class!</i>

15:09.773 --> 15:11.124
<i>(Mandy's voice) Door's open,</i>

15:11.244 --> 15:12.775
<i>and this alarm system
is a waste of your money.</i>

15:12.895 --> 15:16.379
(Laughs) It's funny 'cause it's true.

15:17.965 --> 15:20.183
You put your voice
on my alarm system?

15:20.303 --> 15:21.253
Yeah.

15:21.373 --> 15:23.670
You can reprogram the alarm system,

15:23.790 --> 15:26.189
but you can't back the car
into the garage?

15:26.309 --> 15:28.174
Garage isn't stealing my rights.

15:29.593 --> 15:32.962
Honey? You're on night watch
tonight--you and Dr. Wong.

15:35.933 --> 15:38.668
Please, can you just...
behave yourself?

15:38.788 --> 15:40.136
(Sighs)

15:40.256 --> 15:41.738
- He's a man...
- Yeah.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.640
He's a doctor. He's bright...

15:44.760 --> 15:47.493
We'll figure out
something to talk about.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.563
(Crickets chirping)

15:48.683 --> 15:50.697
You like sports?

15:50.817 --> 15:53.199
No.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.450
Motorcycles?

15:54.570 --> 15:56.586
Don't see the point.

15:59.623 --> 16:01.207
(Exhales deeply)

16:01.327 --> 16:02.292
(Dog barking in distance)

16:02.412 --> 16:04.260
How long is our shift?

16:04.380 --> 16:05.330
Two hours.

16:05.450 --> 16:07.664
Two hours.
How long we been out here?

16:07.784 --> 16:10.800
12 minutes.

16:16.974 --> 16:20.777
Well, speaking of boobs...

16:20.897 --> 16:22.729
Guess who got a boob job?

16:22.849 --> 16:26.416
Angie Peters.
That was months ago.

16:26.536 --> 16:29.452
Yeah.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.204
What if I told you

16:31.324 --> 16:35.391
her husband wasn't the only one
enjoying those boobs?

16:35.511 --> 16:37.160
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.245
According to who?

16:39.365 --> 16:41.965
Well, I can't I.D.
the witness.

16:42.085 --> 16:46.052
(Whispers) Let's just say,
it's my wife.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.005
(Speaking indistinctly)

16:57.384 --> 16:58.651
(TV turns off)

16:58.771 --> 16:59.952
Ohh, I'm watching that.

17:00.072 --> 17:02.855
Guess who just phoned?
I'll give you three hints--

17:02.975 --> 17:06.858
my good friend Angie,
her boobs, and Dr. Wong.

17:06.979 --> 17:10.630
It seems the whole neighborhood
is talking about Angie's affair,

17:10.750 --> 17:13.799
and everyone thinks I am the one
who started the rumor.

17:13.919 --> 17:17.053
Well, in fairness, you did.

17:17.173 --> 17:20.406
Mike, I told you that
in confidence. How could you?

17:20.526 --> 17:23.809
Well, I'm walking around
with a guy I don't know,

17:23.929 --> 17:26.811
and in order to break the ice,
I started talking about boobs,

17:26.932 --> 17:28.247
and he already heard about her boobs,

17:28.367 --> 17:32.234
so I-I, you know,
had to give him something fresh.

17:32.354 --> 17:35.688
You are so concerned with
keeping us safe in this house.

17:35.808 --> 17:36.956
You want me to feel safe?

17:37.076 --> 17:39.992
Don't repeat the secrets I tell you.

17:40.112 --> 17:42.061
(Footsteps recede)

17:43.964 --> 17:46.916
So when Frank Lippe makes an offer,

17:47.036 --> 17:49.835
I'm gonna make a buzzer sound,
like... (Imitates buzzer)

17:49.955 --> 17:53.539
Yeah? And then say,
"the price is wrong."

17:54.608 --> 17:58.177
See? Like in a game show.
(Imitates buzzer)

17:58.297 --> 17:59.745
Yeah, I got it.

17:59.865 --> 18:01.814
Mikey, are you with me?

18:01.934 --> 18:03.182
A little distracted.

18:03.302 --> 18:06.986
When I left the house,
Vanessa was kind of mad at me.

18:07.106 --> 18:08.387
So call her.

18:08.507 --> 18:10.940
You know, I think she probably
needs some time, you know?

18:11.060 --> 18:12.325
So don't call her.

18:12.445 --> 18:13.826
But I can't stop thinking about it.

18:13.946 --> 18:16.762
This is starting to feel
like a lady conversation.

18:18.432 --> 18:19.932
Mr. Alzate?

18:20.052 --> 18:21.002
So...

18:22.402 --> 18:23.919
(Clears throat)

18:24.039 --> 18:26.706
Yes. Uh, forgive me.
Uh, who are you?

18:26.826 --> 18:28.574
Misty Cavanaugh.
Frank couldn't make it.

18:28.694 --> 18:30.576
He's caught up in Grand Junction.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.649
I will be your sales rep tonight.

18:36.769 --> 18:38.150
I'll take a thousand.

18:39.753 --> 18:41.153
Of what?

18:41.273 --> 18:43.622
Whatever you got.

18:43.742 --> 18:46.359
Lippe by a knockout.

18:46.479 --> 18:48.794
(Cell phone rings)

18:48.914 --> 18:52.131
Hello? Hi.

18:52.251 --> 18:55.034
Where are you?

18:55.154 --> 18:56.602
(Chuckles)

18:56.722 --> 18:59.472
Okay--all right,
I'll be right there. Yeah.

18:59.592 --> 19:02.107
(Cell phone clatters) (Chuckles)

19:08.949 --> 19:11.384
What's this?

19:11.504 --> 19:15.221
It's, uh, an apology
wrapped in a bomb shelter.

19:18.759 --> 19:21.560
Oh, wow.

19:23.346 --> 19:26.432
I was wrong.

19:26.552 --> 19:29.335
Which time?

19:29.455 --> 19:32.071
I-I'm kidding.

19:32.191 --> 19:33.873
Go on.

19:33.993 --> 19:35.474
You were wrong?

19:36.777 --> 19:38.677
I violated your trust,

19:38.797 --> 19:41.714
and I do want you
to feel safe in every way.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.582
Well, it's not all your fault.

19:43.702 --> 19:45.751
I mean, I did start the gossip

19:45.871 --> 19:49.455
and I did force you
to interact with our neighbors.

19:49.575 --> 19:50.790
(Exhales deeply)

19:50.910 --> 19:53.225
So unnatural.

19:55.128 --> 19:57.663
I wish we could live down here.
It'd be so simple.

19:57.783 --> 19:59.432
I know, honey.

19:59.552 --> 20:00.533
We got everything we need.

20:00.653 --> 20:02.301
You got canned stuff,
you got mattresses,

20:02.421 --> 20:03.669
you got peaches...

20:03.789 --> 20:05.771
(Mouth full) Mmm. Honey, this is
really good. What is this?

20:05.891 --> 20:07.339
Ooh.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.943
"Pork loaf."

20:13.213 --> 20:15.514
From the '50s?!

20:29.475 --> 20:31.093
(Knocks on window)

20:34.731 --> 20:36.081
(Chuckles)

20:36.201 --> 20:39.518
(Loudly) So how'd
the sales meeting go?

20:39.638 --> 20:40.769
(Chuckles)

20:40.889 --> 20:42.444
From what I remember,

20:42.564 --> 20:46.740
it's possible I'm not
the negotiator I thought I was.

20:46.860 --> 20:48.867
Well, what'd you buy
that I gotta sell?

20:48.987 --> 20:53.782
200 boxes of
big-n-wide hiking shorts.

20:55.101 --> 20:58.103
So we make little tents
out of 'em. What else?

20:58.223 --> 20:59.254
Ohh.

20:59.374 --> 21:02.674
40 boxes of fish jerky.

21:03.876 --> 21:05.444
Doesn't go bad...

21:05.564 --> 21:07.879
Starts out bad.

21:10.266 --> 21:11.349
That's it?

21:11.469 --> 21:15.387
I might have asked Missy
to move in with me.

21:15.507 --> 21:18.156
<i>Thought her name was Misty.</i>

21:18.276 --> 21:21.024
Could be, could be.

21:21.144 --> 21:24.629
That's one of the things
we can work out if she ever...

21:24.749 --> 21:26.465
brings my car back.

21:28.599 --> 21:31.410
