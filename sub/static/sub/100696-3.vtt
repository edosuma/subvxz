09:43.249 --> 09:44.208
Um...

09:44.292 --> 09:46.335
What-- what’s that you got there?

09:46.419 --> 09:49.880
We made the most annoying robot
in the entire world.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.132
-Check it out.
-Nice.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.341
-You made this?
-[Kam] Turn it on.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.676
-[Pops] Yeah.
-All right.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.178
-[Pops] Come on, Broadway.
-[Kam] Come on, turn it on.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.888
[Kam] What's the struggle? Turn it on.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.599
-[Kam] Come on, turn it on.
-[Pops] It's easy.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.642
-Okay, okay, okay, guys,
-[boys encouraging] 

10:01.726 --> 10:03.811
I think--
I think Uncle Broadway gets it.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.439
Here, take that back.
You made a really cool robot

10:06.522 --> 10:08.691
that's very annoying, as promised.

10:09.066 --> 10:12.653
Why don’t you guys do anything
other than be around here right now?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.405
[Pops] Okay, I love you, Dad.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.990
Lo-- love you too, buddy.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.662
-Jesus.
-Yeah, that was rough.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.498
Dude, did I drop the ball?

10:25.041 --> 10:25.916
Uh...

10:26.292 --> 10:28.961
I mean, you kind of put me
in a tough spot, dawg.

10:29.837 --> 10:30.838
You saw that.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.174
-Yeah.
-Are they okay?

10:36.469 --> 10:37.887
I mean, I thought they were.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.892
Who put them in Dothraki school? Like...

10:43.601 --> 10:46.437
-That's my money paying for that?
-Wizard school, bro?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.650
-This is their mom's fault.
-[bowl clinking]

10:51.108 --> 10:52.068
[crunching]

10:52.193 --> 10:55.237
I really should just handle everybody
on my own, or leave.

10:55.946 --> 10:59.075
-Dudes leave their family all the time.
-They do.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.036
And they seem like they have natural,
like, good times.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.579
I turned out cool, bro.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.874
[groans] Leaving’s not the answer.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.085
So, Mom,

11:09.877 --> 11:10.961
that thing with Izzy,

11:11.253 --> 11:12.713
what do you feel about that?

11:13.130 --> 11:14.548
Honestly, um...

11:14.840 --> 11:16.759
I'm still processing.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.011
I don't want to talk to her until I--

11:19.095 --> 11:21.639
I mean, silence, to me,
seems like a strange...

11:22.139 --> 11:24.266
impulse to an epic parental failure.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.102
-Drea-- Please--
-[Drea] You know what?

11:26.185 --> 11:28.104
I’m sorry, I’m editorializing.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.606
Why don’t you just walk me through
what you’re feeling?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.316
Probably some self-loathing?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.735
Disappointment? Really take me there.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.363
Well, I wasn't feeling
any of those things

11:37.446 --> 11:38.864
until you just said that.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.034
-Well, I'm glad I could help.
-Is that what you call it? "Help"?

11:42.118 --> 11:44.453
Hey, I don’t want to be an alarmist here,

11:44.537 --> 11:48.833
but the next 24 hours determines
whether or not Izzy lives or dies.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.335
Oh. [scoffs]

11:51.419 --> 11:53.796
Well, I'm glad
you're not being an alarmist.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.716
My mom pays for my subscription
to <i>The Atlantic.</i>

11:57.049 --> 11:58.884
I wish she read it once in a while.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.762
<i>Since she seemed so unconcerned</i>
<i>on the subject,</i>

12:02.263 --> 12:06.016
I had to explain that society
sees black girls as older than their age.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.936
That it’s not just a problem,
it’s an epidemic.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.605
That this idea has been around
ever since slavery.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.401
<i>How nothing is more convenient</i>
<i>than creating a narrative</i>

12:15.484 --> 12:18.863
<i>that little black girls</i>
<i>look and act older than their age</i>

12:18.946 --> 12:22.408
<i>to justify all the horrible shit</i>
<i>this country has asked of us.</i>

12:22.491 --> 12:25.786
And how now, 400 years later,
there's finally a name for it:

12:25.870 --> 12:27.329
adultification.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.875
I then pointed out the countless studies
done about adultification.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.252
<i>Like the one from Georgetown Law,</i>

12:33.669 --> 12:36.630
<i>which showed that 325 adults</i>

12:36.714 --> 12:39.133
<i>from different races and backgrounds</i>

12:39.216 --> 12:42.344
<i>all perceive black girls</i>
<i>as being more mature,</i>

12:42.428 --> 12:45.431
<i>more sexual and less in need of protection</i>

12:45.514 --> 12:47.141
<i>than white girls their age.</i>

12:47.224 --> 12:50.352
<i>And this perception affects</i>
<i>every aspect of our lives,</i>

12:50.436 --> 12:51.687
<i>whether it's in school,</i>

12:51.771 --> 12:53.981
<i>where black girls</i>
<i>are three times more likely</i>

12:54.064 --> 12:55.900
<i>to get disciplined than white girls.</i>

12:56.567 --> 12:57.902
Or the healthcare system,

12:57.985 --> 13:00.821
where black women
or two to six times more likely to die

13:00.905 --> 13:03.449
from complications of pregnancy
than white women.

13:03.741 --> 13:07.828
<i>And black infants die twice as often</i>
<i>as their white counterparts.</i>

13:07.912 --> 13:11.332
<i>And we're sure as hell less protected</i>
<i>than white girls from predators.</i>

13:11.415 --> 13:12.833
[crowd clamoring]

13:12.917 --> 13:14.460
[Drea] If all that's not bad enough,

13:14.543 --> 13:17.755
we’ve got social media to thank
for making it even easier

13:17.838 --> 13:21.300
for the messed-up way the world
looks at us to just flourish.

13:21.383 --> 13:25.596
<i>And since black girls as young as</i>
<i>five years old are subject to this crap,</i>

13:25.679 --> 13:29.308
<i>adultification means</i>
<i>that little black girls,</i> <i>like Izzy,</i>

13:29.391 --> 13:31.060
<i>don't get to have a childhood.</i>

13:31.268 --> 13:34.146
<i>So the way I looked at it,</i>
<i>my mom had two choices.</i>

13:34.230 --> 13:36.607
Either talk to Izzy now
or see her in a bikini

13:36.690 --> 13:38.859
on the Explore page
of Broadway's Instagram.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.279
Now,<i> </i>I'm going to ask you again.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.115
How are you feeling?

13:45.407 --> 13:49.578
First of all,
I am so proud of my little girl.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.623
You are so smart. I taught you so well.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.875
I probably would have added something
about Venus Hottentot

13:54.959 --> 13:57.711
and how she was paraded naked
all over Europe because of her big butt

13:57.795 --> 13:59.755
‘cause that would've added
a little bit of historical context--

13:59.839 --> 14:01.173
I'm talking about Izzy!

14:01.257 --> 14:03.300
How are you feeling about Izzy?

14:03.843 --> 14:04.802
Um...

14:07.555 --> 14:10.224
Like an epic parental failure.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.643
God, is she going to be okay?

14:14.937 --> 14:15.855
I blew it.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.898
[whispering] We got it.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.567
[Joya] Oh, my God, I blew it.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.986
She’s gonna be on the pole soon.

14:22.987 --> 14:27.283
It's a black gentrification,
origin story of black people.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.200
Like, if...

14:28.450 --> 14:30.995
if the radioactive spider bit blackness,

14:31.328 --> 14:34.874
this-- and made it move out--
like, okay. So, like,

14:35.332 --> 14:37.960
black… are you--
You don’t have to answer, but are you--

14:38.043 --> 14:40.880
anyway, gentrification is a part of…

14:41.088 --> 14:44.216
Bixby, remind me to call
the business manager ASAP.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.386
Sweetie, hi. I'm so happy to see you.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.263
I wanted to, um, talk to you.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.181
Yeah, I need to ask you...

14:51.265 --> 14:52.474
um, something.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.102
Oh, okay. Yeah, ask me anything.
What-- What do you need?

14:55.185 --> 14:58.856
Uh, can you just tell Caleb’s parents
that I’m not going to the sleepover?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.816
Yeah, that’s no problem. But honey...

15:00.900 --> 15:03.444
Stink, I just wanted to talk
about what happened earlier.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.361
[Kenya] Babe.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.572
I think there’s a lot of things
you don’t realize--

15:06.655 --> 15:08.532
What time is the liberation feast
gonna be ready?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.326
-Like, people need to be freed. Honestly.
-I know.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.202
But Izzy, I'm not done with you.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.871
-Babe, like, times?
-I'm not... [sighs] 

15:13.954 --> 15:16.749
Like, we need to know what time--
the freedom cake needs time to rise up.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.876
I was trying to have something
with my daughter.

15:18.959 --> 15:21.462
She needed something from me.
You ruined that. So, thank you.

15:21.545 --> 15:24.882
I'm sorry.
I'm worried about what time people--

15:24.965 --> 15:26.675
Your cake? Is that what you want?
Your cake? 

15:26.759 --> 15:28.594
It just needs time to rise up, I said.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.221
-You wanna rise up? Here.
-Oh, my God, you're so...

15:31.305 --> 15:32.723
Rise up. Rise up.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.392
-[Kenya] Does that sound risen to you?
-No.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.977
That sounds enslaved.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.145
<i>Of course she doesn't care.</i>

15:38.228 --> 15:41.148
She’s always doing some half-assed
Juneteenth celebration.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.733
Remember last year?

15:42.816 --> 15:46.111
She ordered a pizza and put on
the Fleetwood Mac station on Sonos.

15:46.570 --> 15:50.032
Fleetwood Mac for the ending of slavery.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.450
That's what she gave us.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.495
The pizza was not bad, to be fair.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.747
You don’t have to pick up their stuff.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.291
That’s not your job.
They should pick up their own stuff.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.461
I sometimes leave stuff around.
I’d like that picked up, though.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.797
And my wife
can pick up her own stuff, too.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.007
Um, I lost my Rolex.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.677
It’s like a watch like this.
If you see it,

16:10.344 --> 16:13.222
it can just go back
and I won't say anything. Okay?

16:13.305 --> 16:14.807
-Tickle attack!
-[Kenya] Ah!

16:14.932 --> 16:16.725
[Pops and Kam] Ah!

16:16.850 --> 16:18.686
Oh, my-- Hold on! What--

16:19.770 --> 16:21.188
What is that smell?

16:22.439 --> 16:23.649
[sniffing]

16:24.400 --> 16:26.443
Oh, my God, it’s the both of you!

16:27.152 --> 16:29.363
You smell
like two tiny little homeless men!

16:29.822 --> 16:32.074
This isn’t cool, man,
this is like a bumfight!

16:33.492 --> 16:35.452
When's the last time
you guys took a shower?

16:35.869 --> 16:37.079
I don't know.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.581
[suspenseful music playing]

16:41.792 --> 16:43.377
[Drea]<i> My dad has a pretty unique way</i>

16:43.460 --> 16:46.171
<i>of getting answers out of the boys</i>
<i>when he needs them.</i>

16:48.924 --> 16:51.135
Just look here, you stinking little hobos.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.680
I got some simple questions
and I'm expecting some simple answers.

16:54.763 --> 16:58.100
[Drea] <i>And by “unique,” I mean he stole it</i>
<i>from </i>Menace II Society.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.768
Now listen to me, you little bitch.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.770
I’m gonna ask you
some real simple questions

17:01.854 --> 17:03.647
and I want some real simple answers.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.899
[Drea] <i>The exact cadence, words,</i>

17:05.983 --> 17:09.111
<i>he even made my camera guy</i>
<i>shoot it the same way.</i>

17:09.361 --> 17:10.446
<i>So unoriginal.</i>

17:10.529 --> 17:12.156
[Kenya] So let's get this straight.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.991
When was the last time you showered?

17:14.074 --> 17:15.117
Saturday morning.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.913
[Kenya] So you showered on a Saturday...

17:19.997 --> 17:21.165
At 11:15?

17:21.623 --> 17:24.251
[Pops stammering]
Showered on Saturday morning.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.836
[Caine] Yeah, 11:15.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.381
Was that before or after the movies?

17:29.590 --> 17:31.759
[Kam] Before. It was before the movies.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.136
It was before the movies.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.388
Uh, yes, I think.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.098
If I recall correctly.

17:38.766 --> 17:39.600
Yes.

17:40.142 --> 17:43.437
[clears throat] So I’m gonna
ask you again. Last time you showered…

17:44.188 --> 17:45.189
was Friday?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.524
Yes, we definitely showered on Friday.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.902
Definitely.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.781
Now, you see, son.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.867
You see that date?
You know you done fucked up now, right?

17:56.950 --> 17:59.244
-You done fucked up. You know that?
-You done fucked up.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.955
You just said you showered on Friday.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.124
You didn’t go to the movies on Friday.

18:05.084 --> 18:09.129
Fine! It was Thursday morning.
We had school pictures!

18:09.213 --> 18:12.216
[Kenya]
So you guys haven't showered in four days?

18:12.633 --> 18:15.260
Four Earth days.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.305
It’s kind of time-management issues.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.308
Mom says we don’t have to shower
on the weekends

18:21.391 --> 18:23.102
as long as we go in the pool.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.561
-What?
-[Joya] <i>No.</i>

18:24.686 --> 18:26.188
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.856
[Kenya] Guys, listen.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.359
You’re getting too old for this.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.945
Seriously, this is real--
this is real stuff, man.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.240
People aren’t gonna wanna fool with you
if you stink, man.

18:37.032 --> 18:40.035
You know what I’m saying?
How you smell matters. It’s hygiene.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.287
We’re about to have dinner
in a second now.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.915
You guys need to go upstairs
and get in the shower,

18:44.998 --> 18:46.583
or I’m calling the dog groomer.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.087
No, that's not an option.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.422
Go shower! That wasn’t a real thing!

18:52.840 --> 18:54.007
And use soap.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.511
Real human soap.

18:57.594 --> 18:58.679
[Kam] Okay!

19:01.140 --> 19:04.393
I can't say shit.
I ain’t seen my kid in four months.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.644
[chuckles]

19:06.436 --> 19:09.690
Izzy! Oh, my God.
I saw your Instagram story.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.191
-You killed it.
-[Izzy] Thanks.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.027
So you could have bent your knees
a little bit on the booty pop,

19:14.111 --> 19:15.654
but we'll get you there.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.157
Izzy?

19:20.450 --> 19:23.162
Can you not encourage that, please?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.246
Dancing?

19:24.329 --> 19:28.208
So I shouldn’t encourage my little sister
to express herself joyfully to music?

19:28.292 --> 19:30.627
I mean, come on. You act like you never
danced with your friends before.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.462
I do dance with my friends,

19:32.546 --> 19:35.048
but I don't put it out there
for everybody to see.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.511
["Don't Walk Away" by Jade playing] 

19:45.142 --> 19:46.435
It's not the same thing.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.271
The Get Down Crew is a semi-professional,

19:49.354 --> 19:53.233
organized dance team
for stress relief and exercise.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.570
You told me it was a mandatory
team-building exercise

19:56.653 --> 19:58.989
-your law firm made you do.
-I love my dancing!

19:59.323 --> 20:00.532
It's all I have!

20:02.701 --> 20:05.037
It is all I have.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.292
Come on, Mom, Izzy’s just posting
like any other kid her age.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.376
And everyone twerks.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.504
It's like our version of the Twist
or whatever you did growing up.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.508
The Twist? What the hell--
How old do you think I am?

20:19.509 --> 20:22.095
I literally have no idea
how old Mom is.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.055
Do you?

20:23.764 --> 20:24.765
Wow.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.810
Now that I think about it, I have no idea.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.773
She’s gotta be, like,
early 50s, late… 20s?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.859
Sixty would be crazy. She’s not 60. No.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.822
Wow, my mom really might be 60 years old.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.116
No, 60’s crazy. She’s not 60.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.786
You know, honestly, it doesn't matter.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.955
-However old she is, she looks great.
-Yeah.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.332
She’s had work done, right?

20:50.832 --> 20:53.293
Definitely. But, like, the good work.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.545
-Like J. Lo or Keanu.
-Okay.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.922
Yeah, not like Dad.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.174
Wait, hold up. Dad’s had work done?

20:59.716 --> 21:01.551
Oh, yeah. A lot.

21:01.635 --> 21:05.013
He’s had, like, beard stuff,
a couple tummy tucks.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.099
-No way.
-You know, I heard Granny say one time

21:07.182 --> 21:09.268
that he almost died
getting eyelid surgery.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.603
What the fuck was he trying to do
to his eyelids?

21:11.687 --> 21:15.482
Hell, I don’t know.
But it didn’t work. Like, at all.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.860
-Looks like he’s never slept.
-Or drunk water.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.698
Damn. We should really figure out
how old our parents are.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.200
Yeah, we're not great.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.787
This is about adultification.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.373
There's a really insightful article
that I read--

21:31.456 --> 21:33.959
Oh, my God!
Have you been talking to Drea?

21:34.584 --> 21:36.420
Don't let her spin you out like this.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.965
You’ve had all of this great work done.
You don’t want frown lines.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.929
Look, I...
I can't just ignore this, Chlo.

21:46.013 --> 21:50.309
I want my girls to know that sexuality
isn't their only currency, you know?

21:50.392 --> 21:52.853
I mean, isn't that
the whole point of feminism?

21:52.936 --> 21:55.314
-Drea was actually saying--
-No, Drea is not a feminist.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.440
She's a bully.

21:56.523 --> 22:00.152
She's out here telling women
how to act and dress and think.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.529
She's like the Taliban but less fun.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.657
I mean, we gotta let Izzy get her life.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.410
This is the moment for girls to do
whatever they want.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.913
Yeah, sure. Unfortunately,
that does not apply to black girls.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.123
Hey, I know that, Mom.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.626
And it's exactly why she has to do
everything her white friends are doing.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.004
Aw. My baby.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.007
I just want to protect her.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.509
Okay, this is the culture now, Mom.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.179
You should be proud of her,
not slut-shaming her.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.222
Are you saying she's a slut?

22:29.806 --> 22:33.268
Oh, my God, my baby girl’s a slut.
Drea's right. I’m a total failure.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.563
My daughter is a slut and it's my fault.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.191
Dude, being a slut isn’t a bad thing.

22:39.274 --> 22:42.444
It is bad-bitch season,
and you have to get with the times!

22:42.527 --> 22:44.946
Instagram models
make more than neurosurgeons.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.323
And strippers are the shit.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.283
God, I hope Chloe is not stripping.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.869
And if she is, I hope she’s not doing it
at Spearmint Rhino

22:50.952 --> 22:54.039
‘cause I keep finding matchbooks
from there in your dad’s jeans.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.209
You know what? Fuck it.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.379
That might be the sobering moment
they both need.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.048
That might be the best thing
for both of them.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.384
Huh.

23:05.884 --> 23:06.843
Come on, Mom.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.679
Are you telling me you've never had
your bad-bitch moment?

23:10.347 --> 23:11.431
Um...

23:12.140 --> 23:15.477
Um, not that I--
Not that I can recall, no.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.606
<i>If you ever show anyone that photo,</i>

23:19.689 --> 23:22.234
I will have you killed
and I will still cry at your funeral.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.115
If you want to be a good mom, you're
gonna let Izzy dance with her friends

23:28.198 --> 23:29.783
like a normal 13-year-old girl.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.910
And I promise you, if you go up there

23:31.993 --> 23:34.121
and give some weirdo speech
about adultification,

23:34.204 --> 23:35.497
you're just gonna make things way worse,

23:35.580 --> 23:37.958
and she's not gonna want
to talk to you about anything. 

23:41.420 --> 23:44.923
You know what? Just throw everything
I said about gentrification out.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.675
Gentrification has nothing to do
with this.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.677
This box represents black culture.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.762
Right? That’s the blackness of the box.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.222
-[Danny] Right.
-This is black culture.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.433
And the white flecks are, like...

23:54.516 --> 23:56.852
the white people coming in and push--

23:56.977 --> 23:58.812
Okay, okay, that’s gentrification.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.522
-So don’t throw it all out,
-Oh, okay.

24:00.605 --> 24:04.693
because that’s something to do with this.
So the white diamond flecks represent…

24:06.403 --> 24:10.532
gentrifica-- represent white gentrifica--
you know, black gentr--

24:10.824 --> 24:12.826
You can't escape blackness, dude.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.287
It's a black box
that you can't get out of, man.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.621
You know what I'm saying?

24:16.788 --> 24:21.293
Uh, so should I just tell your urologist
you'll call him back or...

24:23.128 --> 24:26.173
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hey, guys.
Can you come here for a second?

24:26.882 --> 24:28.258
Yeah. What's up?

24:29.259 --> 24:30.969
Does this-- Does this feel right to you?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.472
I mean, my clothes are a little tight.

24:33.555 --> 24:36.683
-Clothes are a little tight?
-Mine feel pretty loose.

24:36.766 --> 24:37.893
Like, really loose?

24:37.976 --> 24:40.103
Almost like they could fit his body?

24:40.187 --> 24:43.106
And do yours feel
almost like they could fit his body?

24:43.773 --> 24:45.901
To be fair, it was an honest mistake.

24:46.359 --> 24:47.736
Having said that, though,

24:48.361 --> 24:49.905
I do not hate this.

24:50.363 --> 24:53.241
Me neither. I like the room.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.202
You know, I can be myself.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.539
I like to move.
But, you know, I’m-- I’m a casual guy.

24:59.623 --> 25:03.752
And I’m more into, like, a Euro fit.
I feel like I'm in my true form.

25:04.586 --> 25:08.381
And if our Dad spent more time with us,
I’m pretty sure he’d know that.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.967
Why would I want to spend more time
with them? They're idiots.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.761
I mean, they're small idiots.

25:14.387 --> 25:17.224
[sighs] I'm sorry, I don't mean that.
I mean...

25:17.307 --> 25:19.643
they are idiots, but maybe this

25:20.435 --> 25:21.811
is a little bit on me.

25:22.103 --> 25:25.815
I mean, I've been so busy trying to, like,
build a legacy around them,

25:26.441 --> 25:27.943
I guess I could have neglected

25:28.360 --> 25:31.363
who they are and what they're becoming.
I guess that's possible.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.367
No, fuck that.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.869
This is genetic. It's in their marrow.

25:38.161 --> 25:40.038
Joya’s little brothers are weirdos.

25:40.163 --> 25:42.791
They're gonna bottom out at Chico State
and get hooked on Lean.

25:42.874 --> 25:43.917
I can smell it.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.211
Bixby,

25:46.586 --> 25:48.505
remind me to change my will.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.882
Call lawyer immediately.

25:52.259 --> 25:55.887
Look at part with Joya.
May take her out, too.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.932
Genetic defects.

26:00.642 --> 26:01.810
I-- I'll take the call.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.687
He said to just come in.

26:04.312 --> 26:05.146
Fuck!

26:05.230 --> 26:07.357
I'm sure it's fine.
I'm sure it's good news.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.692
It's probably good news.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.114
You want one?

26:14.823 --> 26:15.865
You know I do.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.367
Take this one.

26:18.159 --> 26:19.786
[Joya sighs]

26:23.498 --> 26:26.543
Whoa. I was gonna tell you
I thought I messed up with the boys,

26:26.626 --> 26:27.961
but are you okay?

26:28.920 --> 26:29.879
I just...

26:30.088 --> 26:32.299
I don’t know what to do about Izzy.
I feel like…

26:33.174 --> 26:36.177
I need to press her, you know,
or I'm about to lose her,

26:36.261 --> 26:38.805
but if I press her, I could also lose her.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.099
Wanna talk about it, babe?

26:42.225 --> 26:43.143
Not really.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.186
You sure?

26:46.146 --> 26:48.898
It’s just, like, with Chloe.
It was so clear who she was.

26:48.982 --> 26:52.319
You know, she was like extroverted
and social and bubbly.

26:52.652 --> 26:55.780
And Drea was, like,
this introverted, cerebral--

26:55.864 --> 26:58.700
And at some point have to let go.
I mean, that’s something I do know.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.286
I just felt like
it wasn’t gonna be this soon, so...

27:01.369 --> 27:04.456
Normally, the double ask works.
Like, every time.

27:05.081 --> 27:06.750
But when it backfires,

27:06.833 --> 27:10.253
Jesus Christ, does it backfire!

27:10.337 --> 27:14.049
It’s like I-- like I knew
how to parent them, you know?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.135
‘Cause they were who they were,

27:17.218 --> 27:20.764
and I just kind of watched them
become the best versions of themselves.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.308
But with Izzy,
it’s like I don’t know who she is yet,

27:23.391 --> 27:24.934
-so I don't really know...
-[Kenya] Mm-hm.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.936
...what to say to her or how to help her.

27:27.020 --> 27:27.896
[Kenya grunts]

27:27.979 --> 27:29.731
-I'm sorry. Am I rambling?
-No.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.901
-I'm rambling.
-No, you're-- Go. Please continue.

27:32.984 --> 27:35.820
It’s just, like, I really thought
that I would have her for longer.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.156
Like, that’s my baby,
that’s my baby girl, you know?

27:38.239 --> 27:39.949
-Oh, my God.
-I feel like I'm losing her.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.160
My-- My nose is bleeding.

27:42.243 --> 27:45.747
I'll be-- Yeah. You can’t see the blood,
though, but it’s bleeding.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.790
I'll be right back.

27:46.873 --> 27:48.875
-You okay?
-Yea, I'm fine, babe.

27:48.958 --> 27:52.128
It’s bloodless.
Bloodless nosebleed. It happens.

27:52.796 --> 27:53.922
I love you.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.512
[knocking]

28:00.637 --> 28:01.513
Stink?

28:04.015 --> 28:04.974
Hi, Stink.

28:05.558 --> 28:06.893
Hi, you have a minute?

28:07.185 --> 28:08.186
[Izzy] No, not really.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.356
[Joya] Okay, well, um,
[clicks tongue] I just...

28:11.523 --> 28:13.274
I've been wanting to talk to you about--

28:13.400 --> 28:16.194
If you're here to talk
about the dancing video, don't worry.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.487
I-- I already took it down.

28:18.113 --> 28:18.947
You did?

28:19.030 --> 28:21.991
I take all my videos down,
like, an hour after I post it.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.452
Don't want my content getting stale.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.453
Oh.

28:25.745 --> 28:28.873
[chuckles] Okay.
Yeah, that's cool. Very cool.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.333
No-- No stale content.

28:30.709 --> 28:34.045
Did you tell Caleb’s parents
that I can’t make it to the sleepover?

28:35.255 --> 28:38.800
[sighs] You know what? I haven't,
I'm sorry. I'll do that.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.635
-I'm sorry.
-Great. Thanks, Mom.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.389
Honey, what...

28:44.472 --> 28:45.807
What's going on? You okay?

28:46.975 --> 28:48.935
Yeah, I’m fine. Everything’s great.

28:50.186 --> 28:51.062
Okay.

28:51.938 --> 28:54.107
I’ll leave you to refresh your content.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.359
Mom?

28:57.610 --> 29:02.115
Remember last week when the entire team
was at Caleb's house?

29:03.324 --> 29:04.284
Yeah.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.453
We were playing 2K like we always do,

29:06.536 --> 29:09.414
and then everyone decided
they wanted to play ball,

29:09.497 --> 29:11.040
so I switched up my clothes,

29:11.124 --> 29:13.793
and when I came out,
everyone was looking at me crazy.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.379
I didn't know why
until Caleb came up to me

29:16.463 --> 29:18.798
and whispered that
I should probably go put a bra on.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.175
No!

29:20.759 --> 29:21.676
Yeah.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.261
It's just...

29:23.678 --> 29:24.804
weird now.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.639
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

29:27.265 --> 29:30.143
That's why you don't want to go
tonight to his house.

29:30.852 --> 29:34.105
Yeah. It’s, like, overnight,
everything’s different.

he’s your friend, right?
For a long time? You gonna just...

29:45.408 --> 29:46.868
stop being friends with him?

29:46.951 --> 29:48.411
[scoffs] No, Caleb's my boy.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.372
I just think the sleepover days
might be over.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.042
It's fine.

29:55.376 --> 29:56.920
But he'll still be my friend.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.296
Okay.

It's a painting about the essence
of who we are.

31:21.629 --> 31:23.923
As black people,
we're so many different things;

31:24.007 --> 31:25.967
variations of so many different colors.

And it's the sum total
of all of these colors
