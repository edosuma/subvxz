00:01.880 --> 00:02.881
Previously...

00:02.960 --> 00:04.200
Since you've been home for 20 years,

00:04.280 --> 00:08.080
we have to establish that Jamie's
alive 20 years after Culloden.

00:08.160 --> 00:10.003
Part of me
doesn't want to find him either,

00:10.080 --> 00:12.082
because once we do,
you'll go back to Boston.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.449
I believe these belong to you.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.850
I never thought I'd see these again.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.241
Claire?

00:25.120 --> 00:26.281
It's the hospital in Boston.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.010
Hello, this is Dr Randall.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.923
I scheduled a surgery for next week.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.970
You can handle it, Joe.
Let me know how it goes.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.486
Freedom and whisky gang thegither!

00:35.560 --> 00:37.130
I used to quote that to Jamie.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.726
We will find him.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.280
This is exactly what
Mrs Graham warned me about.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.842
Spending my life chasing a ghost.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.485
It's time to go home.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.686
Sing me a song

00:50.760 --> 00:53.491
Of a lass that is gone

00:53.760 --> 00:56.411
Say, could that lass

00:56.480 --> 00:58.448
Be I?

00:59.400 --> 01:01.448
Merry of soul

01:01.520 --> 01:04.489
She sailed on a day

01:04.560 --> 01:06.642
Over the sea

01:06.720 --> 01:09.041
To Skye

01:09.880 --> 01:12.406
Billow and breeze

01:12.480 --> 01:14.926
Islands and seas

01:15.000 --> 01:19.528
Mountains of rain and sun

01:20.280 --> 01:22.681
All that was good

01:22.760 --> 01:25.206
All that was fair

01:25.480 --> 01:27.562
All that was me

01:27.640 --> 01:30.086
Is gone

01:30.560 --> 01:32.847
Sing me a song

01:32.920 --> 01:35.764
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.840 --> 01:38.081
Say, could that lass

01:38.280 --> 01:39.964
Be I?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.241
Merry of soul

01:43.320 --> 01:46.164
She sailed on a day

01:46.240 --> 01:49.767
Over the sea

01:50.480 --> 01:55.441
To Skye

01:56.600 --> 02:00.764
OUTLANDER

02:03.560 --> 02:05.847
FREEDOM AND WHISKY

02:21.920 --> 02:23.001
Sutures are in place.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.645
We're done here. Let's pack her.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.081
Hold on.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.807
I think I still see
some necrosis under here.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.160
More retraction.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.160
Systolic's dropped to 80.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.242
We need to control
the bleeding and start packing.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.402
We get the necrosis,
and then I will tie off the bleeder.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.001
Forceps.

02:42.920 --> 02:43.921
Down to 70.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.411
- Dr Randall.
- Two seconds.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.403
- We don't have two seconds.
- Then one.

02:51.480 --> 02:52.481
Scissors.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.281
That's it.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.121
Forceps.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.442
I found the bleeder. Clamp.

03:11.840 --> 03:12.887
Tie it off.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.690
Seventy-five and climbing.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.121
Scissors.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.249
All right. Let's pack her.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.321
"Listen, my children,

03:45.400 --> 03:49.405
"and you shall hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere."

03:50.320 --> 03:52.561
Well, we've all heard
Longfellow's immortal verse.

03:52.960 --> 03:57.010
That fateful night. April 18, 1775.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.090
"One if by land, two if by sea."

04:00.480 --> 04:03.165
And our hero, spreading the warning
of the British attack,

04:03.240 --> 04:06.847
and then, single-handedly saving the day.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.441
Except...

04:10.840 --> 04:11.841
It's a lie.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.081
Revere did ride that night,
but he had company.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.125
Two men, in fact.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.328
William Dawes and Samuel Prescott.

04:23.120 --> 04:27.011
Revere made it to Lexington,
but he was captured by the redcoats.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.645
It was Prescott who completed the mission.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.006
But his name is lost to history.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.161
Why?

04:39.040 --> 04:41.008
Revere had a better publicist.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.923
Okay. After the Christmas break,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.411
we'll continue to examine

04:46.480 --> 04:50.565
how fictional prose
can alter the perception of history.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.441
Have a great holiday.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.286
Miss Randall, a word?

05:02.120 --> 05:03.121
You're failing.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.010
This can't come as a surprise.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.846
I've spoken with your other professors,
and it's not just history.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.483
Maybe I'm just not as smart
as everyone thinks I am.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.722
You wouldn't be at Harvard
if that were the case.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.921
Your father was more
than just a colleague.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.047
He was my friend.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.361
So I've always felt a responsibility
to look out for you.

05:25.880 --> 05:28.121
Last semester,
your grades were outstanding.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.841
What's changed?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.731
You can talk to me.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.201
Everythings fine.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.124
You've got to tum this around, Brianna,

05:40.240 --> 05:42.129
or your future here is in jeopardy.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.406
You got that look.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.081
The same look you had
when you came back from Scotland.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.571
You ever gonna tell me
what really happened over there?

08:03.760 --> 08:05.125
There's nothing to tell, really.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.764
Did you meet a man, Lady Jane?

08:10.040 --> 08:11.041
Not exactly.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.047
Jesus. I can't believe you held out on me.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.961
Well?

08:21.040 --> 08:22.530
Well, there was someone.

08:23.960 --> 08:24.961
From my past.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.041
So he's Scottish?

08:29.120 --> 08:31.088
As Scottish as they come.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.640
Sounds serious.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.803
As serious as it comes.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.570
Hell, what happened?

08:42.200 --> 08:43.246
We...

08:44.440 --> 08:45.930
We went our separate ways.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.926
And I had hoped that we would
be able to find each other again,

08:52.040 --> 08:53.280
but fate had other ideas.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.121
Fuck fate.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.282
The post-surgical reports
you asked for, Doctor.

09:00.680 --> 09:01.681
I'm off the clock.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.765
See you tomorrow, Joe.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.205
To be continued.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.680
I've come this far.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.364
No turning back now.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.847
This is either the most
daft thing I've ever done,

09:36.920 --> 09:38.081
or the most brilliant.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.169
Yeah. $2.50, pal.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.726
Keep the change.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.971
Professor Brown told me...

10:03.080 --> 10:06.323
Brianna, if that is the issue,
then you do not go out.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.640
You buckle down.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.846
You're not listening.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.561
What?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.040
Happy Christmas.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.766
Look who's here.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.601
Roger.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.087
What a wonderful surprise.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.800
What are you doing in town?

10:42.880 --> 10:45.850
I should've sent word.
Clearly, I've come at a bad time.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.291
No, not at all.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.446
Brianna and I were just...

10:51.520 --> 10:52.646
Yelling.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.201
Well, Brianna has decided

10:56.800 --> 11:00.441
to withdraw from Harvard
and is moving out.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.043
Which is my decision to make.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.201
Well, I...

11:04.280 --> 11:06.931
Let me call Dean Tramble.
I'm sure he can have you reinstated.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.923
No! You're not listening!

11:09.880 --> 11:11.325
I need a break.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.762
You expect me to just
come back to Boston and he who I was?

11:19.120 --> 11:21.600
I tried, and it's not working.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.206
Look, I have to go.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.166
I'm sorry, Roger. It's good to see you.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.970
Let's hang out tomorrow, okay?

11:41.640 --> 11:44.211
I'm so sorry, Roger.
Let me take your coat.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.204
Thank you, but perhaps
it's best I check into my hotel.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.725
- I don't want to...
- Nonsense.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.325
No, you'll stay here.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.690
Have you been back to Inverness?

11:56.800 --> 11:57.801
No.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.411
With Father gone, well...

12:01.440 --> 12:03.886
There's nothing there for me
but books and dust.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.602
It's your first Christmas
without the Reverend.

12:07.880 --> 12:08.961
Aye.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.201
Aye, he...

12:13.080 --> 12:16.084
He always liked to bring toys
to the children's home.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.605
We were known to sing a rousing round

12:18.680 --> 12:20.921
of O Come All Ye Faithful
for the children

12:21.000 --> 12:23.367
and then eat Mrs Graham's plum pudding.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.327
So I suppose that's one of the reasons
why I took this trip.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.364
I'd like to try an American Christmas.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.128
Maybe make some new traditions of my own.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.364
We used to always read
A Christmas Cam! to Brianna every year.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.809
Till she grew out of it, I guess.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.409
Or maybe Frank and I did.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.090
You seem to be a magnet
for our family quarrels.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.961
You were quarrelling? I hadn't noticed.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.771
You didn't just come here
for an American Christmas, did you?

13:05.800 --> 13:06.961
Is it that obvious?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.484
Well, I'm glad you're here.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.524
Brianna needs someone to talk to,

13:12.600 --> 13:15.843
and you're the only one who understands
what she went through during the summer.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.443
Aye, she puts up a good facade.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.930
Well, I think it's finally hitting her.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.245
Can I pour you a whisky?

13:29.240 --> 13:30.241
Sure.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.361
I have some news...

13:37.720 --> 13:39.324
That might put a smile on your face.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.083
Well, I could do with some good news.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.925
I'm a historian.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.286
That's what I do.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.327
I pursue.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.485
I'm like a dog with a bone.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.965
What are you saying?

14:02.520 --> 14:03.521
I found him.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.443
Well, I found an article written in 1765

14:09.520 --> 14:10.851
in a journal called Forrester's.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.849
It advocates the repeal
on the restrictions

14:12.920 --> 14:15.287
of the import of spirits
to the Scottish Highlands.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.001
Look at this line.

14:24.120 --> 14:28.967
"For as has been known for ages past,
freedom and whisky gang thegither."

14:31.240 --> 14:35.245
At the hotel bar in Edinburgh,
you told me you quoted that line to Jamie.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.041
You think he wrote this?

14:41.320 --> 14:43.846
I do. Look.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.281
Even in the opening of the article,

14:47.680 --> 14:50.411
he quotes the poem again,
addressing the ruling classes,

14:50.480 --> 14:53.848
"Ye knights an' squires,
wha' represent our brughs and shires..."

14:57.000 --> 14:59.321
But this is a poem by Robert Burns.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.690
Anybody could have known this.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.684
Robert Burns was only
six years old in 1765.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.770
The poem wasn't written
until 21 years later.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.320
Only someone with knowledge of the future

15:11.400 --> 15:14.006
could have quoted lines
that hadn't been written yet.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.728
But it doesn't indicate an author.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.480
Have a look at the printers name.

15:23.120 --> 15:26.522
Alexander Malcolm.
Jamie's middle names, no?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.521
He was a printer?

15:39.040 --> 15:42.203
And living in Edinburgh in 1765.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.723
According to the parallel
timeline on our calendar...

15:47.880 --> 15:49.166
That's only a year ago.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.808
Now, I never asked you to do this.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.128
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Well, I don't.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.607
I'm sorry.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.131
I could've lived
the rest of my life not knowing.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.365
Twenty years ago...

16:24.440 --> 16:27.569
I shut the door on the past.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.803
And it was the hardest thing
I have ever done.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.926
And when you told me
he survived Culloden...

16:40.640 --> 16:42.051
I began to hope.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.730
I can't go through that again.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.404
But this isn't just hope.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.566
This is...

16:58.000 --> 17:00.241
This is real. You can go to Jamie.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.124
And leave Brianna?

17:04.880 --> 17:07.121
With everything
that she's going through now?

17:07.720 --> 17:08.721
How?

17:10.839 --> 17:12.523
How could I do that to her?

17:17.200 --> 17:19.123
I am her mother, and she needs me.

17:20.160 --> 17:23.003
And I cannot abandon my daughter.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.925
How can I help? What can I do?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.286
Just don't tell her.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.848
It will only confuse matters.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.680
I won't say a word.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.403
I know you meant well, Roger.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.570
Thank you for a lovely dinner.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.128
I think I'll retire now.
A bit of jet lag, I'm afraid.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.601
What's all this about?

18:32.680 --> 18:36.651
A friend of mine, Horace Thompson,
sent these over for a second opinion.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.166
Pretty lady.

18:43.320 --> 18:47.211
Full grown, mature, maybe late 40s.

19:02.360 --> 19:05.091
He sent you an over
150-year-old murder victim.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.604
You're only off by about 50 years.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.843
Horace is an anthropologist,

19:15.400 --> 19:18.483
and as he's looking for a cause of death,
what makes you think she was murdered?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.201
I don't know.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.969
She's from a cave in the Caribbean.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.810
There were artefacts found with her.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.764
Lookie here.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.441
You were right.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.886
Broken neck?

19:42.960 --> 19:44.007
More than that.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.885
Bone's not just cracked.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.608
Fracture plane's
right through the centrum.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.280
Somebody tried to cut
this lady's head clean off

19:53.120 --> 19:54.485
with a dull blade.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.481
How did you know?

20:00.600 --> 20:03.206
She just felt like it.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.411
Found in a cave, you said?

20:08.320 --> 20:10.721
A secret slave burial, they think.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.284
But this lady's no slave, no, sirree.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.131
She wasn't black. See her tibia?

20:18.080 --> 20:19.889
Short, relative to the femur.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.761
The crural index.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.441
This lady was white.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.726
Bones don't lie.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.086
They tell all.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.161
Now...

20:29.960 --> 20:32.691
What aren't you telling me
about your man in Scotland?

20:38.560 --> 20:39.641
He's...

20:47.840 --> 20:49.649
He's Bree's real father.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.331
And I told her when we were in Scotland.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.571
That's the reason she's
struggling so much at the moment.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.411
I'm glad you told me.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.366
Explains a lot.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.526
Do you still love him?

21:13.720 --> 21:15.085
I never stopped.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.566
No one thought you and Frank
were Ozzie and Harriet.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.768
I've watched you live
a half-life for 15 years.

21:29.360 --> 21:32.921
If you have a second chance at love,
you should take it.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.730
Brianna will come around.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.121
Thank you, Joe.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.641
She was desperate to be reunited with him,

21:47.720 --> 21:49.484
no matter what sacrifice she had to make.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.607
Even her life?

21:51.080 --> 21:52.764
Yes, Barnabas, even her life.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.888
She wanted to be with him that much.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.122
I know it's very dificult
for you to accept...

21:59.200 --> 22:01.487
You're kidding. Dark Shadows?

22:02.640 --> 22:04.688
Barnabas has just lost Victoria.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.083
Chris is worried
he'll change into a werewolf,

22:07.160 --> 22:10.926
and, Elizabeth,
she thinks she's gonna be buried alive.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.367
What would your posh
colleagues at Oxford say

22:13.440 --> 22:15.807
if they knew you
were rotting your brain on daytime TV?

22:16.200 --> 22:20.091
Those troglodytes wouldn't understand
the travails of the House of Collins.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.766
Sorry about yesterday.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.569
I shouldn't have dropped in unannounced.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.281
I'm glad you did.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.970
I came for an American Christmas,

22:36.000 --> 22:40.767
and lobster rolls and Boston cream pies,
of course.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.761
I might know someone
who can help you with that.

22:48.520 --> 22:52.161
There's this thing
for my father at Harvard later today.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.403
They're naming a fellowship after him.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.081
Maybe you could come.

22:56.680 --> 23:00.002
We could go early,
and I can show you the hallowed halls.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.561
I'd be honoured.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.041
We could watch
the rest of the episode first, of course.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.681
These are the Robinson cloisters,

23:17.760 --> 23:20.764
one of the only examples
of Gothic Revival on campus.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.483
I wonder how many people have
wandered through here over the years.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.848
The conversations that took place,

23:28.920 --> 23:32.163
the secrets etched
in its nooks and crannies.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.601
It's funny.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.806
I've been coming here since I was a kid.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.723
My dad used to bring me,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.763
and I never once thought about that.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.848
You never wondered whether John Adams

23:45.920 --> 23:51.370
or Teddy Roosevelt or John Kennedy
stood under these same arches?

23:52.120 --> 23:53.167
Nope.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.801
No, I was always fascinated
with how this was built...

23:58.360 --> 24:00.727
That every single piece of stone

24:00.800 --> 24:03.644
is held in place by the pressure
of the one next to it.

24:03.720 --> 24:08.442
It's based on measurements,
calculations, precision.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.690
There's a truth to this building.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.006
That doesn't sound
like the daughter of a historian.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.685
Well, I'm not, am I?

24:16.360 --> 24:19.125
I'm the daughter
of an 18th-century Highlander.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.924
I had few memories of my real father.

24:27.760 --> 24:31.048
There were boxes in the garage.
His letters, his things,

24:32.760 --> 24:36.685
but the Reverend told me a story
about what he was like as a child.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.165
How he made a martin house,

24:39.240 --> 24:42.005
but he made the hole too big,
and a cuckoo got in.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.804
It's a silly story, really,

24:47.160 --> 24:48.889
but he made my father real to me.

24:51.040 --> 24:55.409
And knowing my father
helped me know myself.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.842
Everybody needs a history.

25:01.720 --> 25:02.960
But how do you know it's true?

25:04.280 --> 25:06.442
What if he made it up
to make you feel better?

25:07.120 --> 25:08.121
Does it matter?

25:09.840 --> 25:11.080
But that's my point.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.530
What is history?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.240
It's just a story.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.644
It changes depending on who's telling it.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.126
Like Paul Revere's,
like Bonnie Prince Charlie's,

25:25.200 --> 25:28.170
like my parents', like my own.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.210
History can't be trusted.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.648
We should get going.
The ceremony is about to start.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.203
We're hereto honour
the exceptional work

25:46.520 --> 25:48.761
of the late Professor Frank Randall,

25:49.160 --> 25:52.607
who sewed this university
for nearly 20 years,

25:53.440 --> 25:55.044
and to announce the recipient

25:55.120 --> 25:57.566
of the newly-named
Frank W. Randall fellowship

25:57.640 --> 25:59.563
in the field of European studies.

26:00.240 --> 26:03.289
But first,
let's talk about Professor Randall

26:03.920 --> 26:05.524
and his groundbreaking research.

26:10.360 --> 26:14.604
Dean Tramble, ifs wonderful of you
to honour Frank this way.

26:14.680 --> 26:17.923
It's the least we could do
after all he did for the university.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.206
Thank you.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.805
Professor Travers.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.848
I'll need your grant proposal by Monday.

26:23.760 --> 26:27.162
The endowment board
waits for no man or woman.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.969
It'll be on your desk first thing, sir.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.569
I'm sorry. This is Sandy Travers,

26:34.640 --> 26:36.961
one of Professor Randall's
former students.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.520
This is his wife, Claire.

26:38.880 --> 26:39.881
Pleased to meet you.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.368
Professor Travers is undertaking research

26:42.440 --> 26:45.603
on the influence of colonial English
on autochthonous languages.

26:46.880 --> 26:47.881
That's fascinating.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.526
- Dean, can I have a word?
- Excuse me.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.769
Frank would've hated all this fuss.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.330
I think he would've rather liked it.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.565
He always told me,
"The work is the reward."

27:07.720 --> 27:08.960
If you'll excuse me.

27:10.520 --> 27:11.806
You should've let him go.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.081
I beg your pardon?

27:17.160 --> 27:21.768
All those years. You never wanted him,
but you wouldn't give him up.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.522
I don't see
how that's any of your business.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.604
He told me he stayed
with you for Brianna, but I knew.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.129
Apart of him was still in love with you

27:31.320 --> 27:32.731
and always would be,

27:33.120 --> 27:35.282
no matter how much you broke his heart.

27:36.480 --> 27:41.327
I had to live with that
because he was the love of my life.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.046
And I wanted him,

27:44.080 --> 27:46.447
even if it meant
I had to share him with you.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.489
I could've made him happy.

27:50.480 --> 27:53.086
But you were selfish. You wanted it all.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.601
So you lived a lie, and you made
Frank and Brianna live it too.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.321
You threw away 20 years with him.

28:02.600 --> 28:06.082
I would give anything
to have just one more day.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.449
That blonde woman at the ceremony...

28:24.800 --> 28:27.690
I recognised her. Who is she?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.561
She was a student of your father's.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.806
I remember her.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.202
We were at this bookstore once,
and Daddy stopped to talk to her.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.520
Something about it.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.371
The way he looked at her...

28:44.280 --> 28:46.601
It was the same way
he used to look at you.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.046
Back at the stones,
we said no more lies.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.489
Only the truth between us.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.611
Frank loved her.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.970
It went on for many years,
and he was planning on marrying her.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.048
You told me I looked like Jamie.

29:17.840 --> 29:21.083
All my life, Daddy had to look at me
and see another man.

29:21.640 --> 29:22.880
The man you really loved.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.165
He must have hated me.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.286
No, darling.

29:30.920 --> 29:31.921
No.

29:32.800 --> 29:36.930
You were the one thing
that was really important to Frank.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.445
Raising you,

29:39.760 --> 29:41.603
that was his life's work,

29:42.720 --> 29:44.165
his greatest joy.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.166
What about you?

29:49.920 --> 29:52.571
There must've been
a pan of you that resented me.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.883
I was the reason you lost Jamie.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.201
Never.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.441
What I resented
was that I had to leave Jamie.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.049
But the day you were born,

30:08.320 --> 30:11.403
and I held you in my arms

30:12.800 --> 30:14.723
and nursed you for the first time,

30:15.800 --> 30:17.370
and you looked up at me...

30:19.160 --> 30:21.527
I've never felt anything else like it.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.928
I love you for you, Brianna.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.002
Not for the man who fathered you.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.609
You must still think about him.

30:38.800 --> 30:39.801
I do.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.963
There's something else that I

30:49.440 --> 30:50.930
need to be honest about.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.130
"Alexander Malcolm."

31:00.480 --> 31:01.481
This...

31:02.720 --> 31:05.291
This is Jamie? You found him?

31:05.360 --> 31:06.850
Well, Roger did.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.925
Then you can go back.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.362
That's not why I'm telling you this.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.963
My life is here, with you.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.724
I'm all grown up, Mama.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.000
I can live on my own.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.884
I love you, but I don't need you.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.450
Not the way I did when I was little.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.891
I know.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.401
Come on.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.286
And God called the light "day, "

31:54.360 --> 31:56.362
<i>and the darkness, he sailed 'Knight. "</i>

31:56.440 --> 31:59.091
And the evening
and the morning were the first day.

31:59.160 --> 32:03.131
How do you take a trip like that
and come back to life as you knew it?

32:04.160 --> 32:06.891
And let it divide
the waters from the waters.

32:07.560 --> 32:11.281
And God made the firmament
and divided the waters...

32:11.360 --> 32:14.887
I had been, in many ways,
further than the moon,

32:15.360 --> 32:17.567
on an even more impossible journey.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.410
And the answer was "yes, "

32:20.840 --> 32:22.808
you can come back to your life,

32:23.480 --> 32:25.005
but it's never the same.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.091
But maybe it was enough to have gone once.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.608
How many people can say they had that?

32:32.720 --> 32:34.722
And from the crew of Apollo 8,

32:35.120 --> 32:40.286
we close with good night,
good luck, a Merry Christmas,

32:40.360 --> 32:44.331
and God bless all of you,
all of you on the good Earth.

32:46.560 --> 32:50.849
Apollo 8, Apollo 8,
this is Houston. Three minutes...

33:22.960 --> 33:24.689
Bree, have you thought this through?

33:27.240 --> 33:28.651
If I go...

33:29.200 --> 33:31.123
I may never be able to come back.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.281
It's not like an elevator,
where you can just jump on and off.

33:36.360 --> 33:37.407
You've done it before.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.330
But there are no guarantees.

33:42.480 --> 33:45.290
It's possible
we may never see each other again.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.131
Can you live with that?

33:50.560 --> 33:52.881
'Cause I don't know if I can.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.165
To not be there to...

33:59.080 --> 34:00.525
See you get married.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.284
Walk you down the aisle,

34:04.960 --> 34:06.962
or to watch you become a mother...

34:08.199 --> 34:09.725
Hold my first grandchild.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.081
I know.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.726
It won't be easy.

34:16.960 --> 34:17.960
But...

34:19.000 --> 34:23.847
I have been trying to figure out
if I was more Randall or Fraser.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.530
And what I realised is that I'm more you

34:30.239 --> 34:31.764
than I am either of my fathers.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.643
And if I can turn out
to be half the woman you are,

34:37.800 --> 34:39.210
then I'll be fine.

34:43.639 --> 34:46.085
But I'm the one
who knows you better than anyone.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.690
You know who doesn't know me?

34:49.480 --> 34:50.481
Jamie.

34:51.920 --> 34:55.208
You owe it to him to go back,
and I want you to go.

34:57.520 --> 34:58.851
And tell him everything.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.160
There's something else.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.684
What if he's forgotten me?

35:16.160 --> 35:17.207
Or...

35:18.640 --> 35:20.927
What if he doesn't love me any more?

35:23.240 --> 35:25.811
You told me what you felt for Jamie

35:26.160 --> 35:29.130
was the most powerful thing
you ever felt in your life.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.520
Has that changed?

35:34.920 --> 35:35.921
No.

35:36.880 --> 35:39.360
Then you have to trust
it's the same for him.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.084
You gave Jamie up for me.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.850
Now I have to give him back to you.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.763
Joe, I need a second opinion.

36:02.880 --> 36:03.881
What's the case?

36:04.680 --> 36:07.445
Well, actually,
what I need is an honest opinion...

36:10.760 --> 36:12.967
- From a friend.
- Okay.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.690
Am I attractive?

36:20.360 --> 36:21.361
Sexually?

36:22.960 --> 36:24.405
It's a trick question, right?

36:25.400 --> 36:27.926
No. I need a male point of view,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.606
and, well, you're the only man
I can have this conversation with.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.411
Is this about your man?

36:36.200 --> 36:37.964
I'm thinking of giving it a go.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.690
And you wanna look like you never left.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.886
Well, I haven't seen him in 20 years.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.725
Have I changed terribly
since I first met you?

36:47.600 --> 36:50.444
You're a skinny white broad
with too much hair, but a great ass.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.088
He'll be in heaven
when he sees you, Lady Jane.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.128
That's exactly what I needed to know.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.281
What?

37:09.840 --> 37:11.808
It's nothing. Just...

37:13.040 --> 37:14.326
Thank you, Joe.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.168
My pleasure. Merry Christmas.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.601
Merry Christmas.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.648
We found them in an antique store.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.001
These certainly
will be useful in Edinburgh.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.209
I wanted to get you a flashlight,

37:49.280 --> 37:51.601
but Roger said
you'd end up at another witch trial.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.488
Well, I figured this would come in handy.

38:05.720 --> 38:08.246
This would've been helpful
first time around.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.806
I've been thinking
a lot about what else I'll need.

38:14.280 --> 38:18.285
I borrowed some scalpels
and penicillin from the hospital.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.845
Clever.

38:19.920 --> 38:24.528
Well, I thought, "1766 Edinburgh
will need it more than 1968 Boston."

38:27.040 --> 38:29.646
Thank you both. It's incredibly generous.

38:29.720 --> 38:30.721
Wait.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.241
There's one more.

38:48.960 --> 38:49.961
Bree.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.970
It's beautiful.

38:56.880 --> 38:57.881
Topaz.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.487
It's your birthstone.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.488
You'll need it
when you go through the stones.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.211
Gillian mentioned in her notebook
that gemstones were necessary.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.524
I lost one both times
I went through before.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.410
First, my jewelled watch,

39:16.480 --> 39:19.211
and then,
the stone from Jamie's father's ring.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.282
How are you going to carry all of this?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.850
I suppose I have to make something.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.086
You're going to make it?

39:34.080 --> 39:37.527
After 15 years of making
your costumes and pageant outfits,

39:37.600 --> 39:39.648
I think I know
my way around a sewing machine,

39:39.720 --> 39:40.960
thank you very much.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.121
That's brilliant.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.641
You could have your very own utility belt,

39:45.120 --> 39:47.088
just like the caped crusader himself.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.089
You really do watch a lot of TV.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.201
Mama! You dyed your hair.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.691
Well, I just touched up the grey.

41:37.560 --> 41:40.245
- A little help from Miss Clairol.
- That looks very natural.

41:40.720 --> 41:43.371
You look beautiful,
with or without Miss Clairol.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.280
So is this it?

41:47.880 --> 41:48.881
The bat-suit.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.725
Yes, I...

41:52.680 --> 41:56.321
I put some secret pockets in
so I can bring everything that I need.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.725
You made it out of raincoats.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.927
Well, it rains a lot in Scotland,
no matter what century.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.281
The hem's a mess,

42:05.360 --> 42:07.362
and one arm is still longer
than the other, but...

42:07.440 --> 42:10.364
Mama, I promise you,
no one is going to care.

42:10.720 --> 42:11.960
Especially Jamie.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.850
- Is that my...
- Blouse.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.001
May I borrow it?

42:25.400 --> 42:26.686
It'll look perfect.

42:30.440 --> 42:31.885
Pardon me. I...

42:32.760 --> 42:34.762
I have to fetch one last-minute provision.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.841
He's a good one.

42:42.920 --> 42:43.921
I know.

42:51.640 --> 42:53.881
I want you to give this to Joe Abernathy.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.286
It's...

42:55.920 --> 42:57.331
My resignation letter.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.121
He'll know what to do with it.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.204
And this is the deed to the house.

43:03.640 --> 43:06.769
Your name's on it now,
along with all the bank accounts.

43:14.360 --> 43:17.170
I cant believe you're not
letting me come with you to Scotland.

43:19.400 --> 43:20.526
This is how I want to do it.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.643
First time I went through,

43:25.680 --> 43:27.045
I was terrified.

43:29.360 --> 43:32.489
Second time, heartbroken.

43:35.600 --> 43:38.729
This time, I want it to be peaceful.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.129
If I had to say goodbye to you there...

43:43.920 --> 43:45.445
I might never go.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.161
Well...

43:50.520 --> 43:51.885
That is not an option.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.530
My beautiful girl.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.603
I am gonna miss you so much.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.171
But I'll be fine.

44:04.960 --> 44:06.450
Find my father.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.211
And give him this.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.601
I have something I want to give you.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.121
Scottish pearls.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.091
Jamie gave these to me
on our wedding night.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.567
They were his mother's... Ellen...

44:46.360 --> 44:47.566
Your grandmother.

44:50.760 --> 44:52.888
You could wear them
on your wedding day, if you like.

44:57.680 --> 44:58.841
They're beautiful.

45:13.560 --> 45:14.800
Thank you, Roger...

45:15.720 --> 45:17.165
For being a dog with a bone.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.321
For everything.

45:24.680 --> 45:25.886
I'll miss you.

45:27.440 --> 45:28.601
One last thing...

45:30.920 --> 45:32.160
A wee nip for the road.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.128
To freedom and whisky.

45:54.680 --> 45:55.886
Freedom and whisky.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.161
Stay here a minute.

47:00.640 --> 47:01.641
Are you all right?

47:36.400 --> 47:38.801
Lobster roll and Boston cream pie?

47:39.560 --> 47:42.166
Maybe later we can watch
A Charlie Brown Christmas?

47:42.560 --> 47:43.561
What's that?

47:44.520 --> 47:46.841
Part of your new
American Christmas tradition.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.929
I have something for you too.

48:49.200 --> 48:51.521
"Marley was dead, to begin with.

48:51.760 --> 48:54.161
"There was no doubt whatever about that.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.324
"The register of his burial was signed

48:56.400 --> 48:59.051
"by the clergyman, the clerk,
the undertaker..."

49:02.640 --> 49:06.008
When I was small,
I never wanted to step in puddles.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.570
I couldn't bring myself to believe

49:08.640 --> 49:10.290
that the perfect, smooth expanse

49:10.360 --> 49:13.091
was no more than a thin film
of water over solid earth.

49:15.440 --> 49:18.762
I believed it was an opening
into some fathomless space

49:19.000 --> 49:22.925
and if I stepped in,
I would drop at once and keep on falling.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.965
Even now, when I see a puddle in my path,

49:28.040 --> 49:31.408
my mind half halts, though my feet do not,

49:31.480 --> 49:32.925
and I hurry on,

49:35.680 --> 49:38.604
with only the echo
of the thought left behind.

50:03.400 --> 50:06.290
Pardon. I'm looking for a printer.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.726
Mr Malcolm. Alexander Malcolm.

50:10.160 --> 50:13.209
Aye, just down the way and to the left.

50:13.560 --> 50:14.925
Carfax Close, madam.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.481
Thank you.

52:12.360 --> 52:13.964
That you, Geordie?

52:16.560 --> 52:17.925
It took you long enough.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.606
Where'd you go to get the ash?
All the way to Glasgow?

52:48.120 --> 52:49.281
It isn't Geordie.

52:54.440 --> 52:55.441
It's me...

52:59.760 --> 53:00.761
Claire.
