This morning?

Right after they put the motion sickness

-This one time in daycare,

06:43.778 --> 06:46.239
I held it so long,
they called in an ambulance,

the Jaws of Life to pry my mouth open,

11:13.047 --> 11:16.175
I heard there's a story on this plane.
What's going on?

11:16.258 --> 11:19.136
Something to do with the ridiculous number
of babies onboard?

11:19.220 --> 11:20.930
-Why so many?
-Reached for comment,

11:21.013 --> 11:23.182
the boy who smells like news said this...

11:23.265 --> 11:24.100
Uh... [gasps]

11:24.183 --> 11:26.727
What in the world am I seeing?

11:26.811 --> 11:28.562
[gasps] Staci!

11:28.646 --> 11:30.940
Nope, it's Stevefan. And let me guess,

11:31.023 --> 11:33.776
your name is,
"I don't have to listen to Stevefan

11:33.859 --> 11:36.320
because I don't know what's good for me."
[laughs]

11:36.404 --> 11:38.572
Can you confirm that is, in fact,
your name?

11:38.656 --> 11:39.615
March!

11:40.574 --> 11:43.619
Now, I don't want to scare you,
but I'm gonna scare you.

11:43.702 --> 11:47.164
When Junior Jet Rangers can't stay
in their own seats,

11:47.248 --> 11:51.877
it's my duty to strap them
into our special naughty boy jump seat.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.504
[Stevefan] Whoo!

11:53.587 --> 11:55.172
-[Stevefan laughing]
-[buckle clicks]

11:55.256 --> 11:58.050
[groans] I was just helping the babies.

11:58.134 --> 12:02.388
The babies are none of your concern.
So be good,

12:02.471 --> 12:07.268
sit still, and know that Stevefan
is watching you forever and always,

12:07.351 --> 12:09.395
even when you think I'm not.

12:09.478 --> 12:14.650
[drawing out syllables] Stevefan.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.987
You think he's Mega Fat's inside man?

12:18.070 --> 12:22.533
Duh. You need to go on offense.
Take that flight attendant down.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.952
[Staci] He's the key
to Mega Fat's whole evil plan.

12:25.035 --> 12:29.081
Stop the inside man, no more babies cry,
everybody has a nice flight,

12:29.165 --> 12:31.459
Marsha Krinkle goes home
without a bad baby news story,

12:31.542 --> 12:34.044
-and we all keep our jobs.
-I don't know.

12:34.128 --> 12:38.632
Everybody's really calm and sleeping now,
and I don't want to get into more trouble.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.718
[snorts] Typical timid Templeton.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.845
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Forget it.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.764
Let's just try to get through
the rest of this flight.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.434
[Tim growling]

12:48.684 --> 12:52.146
"No! I have a dinosaur wife and children."

12:52.229 --> 12:55.107
"You should've thought of that
before you were so delicious!"

12:55.191 --> 12:56.442
[growling]

12:56.525 --> 13:01.197
[slurring] I'm-a travel choo-choo
all the way to Grandmama's.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.740
[snoring]

13:03.407 --> 13:05.242
-Rarrr!
-[baby giggling]

13:05.326 --> 13:06.327
Huh?

13:06.744 --> 13:09.455
[Staci squeals]
They're all over the cabin!

13:12.124 --> 13:14.585
[babbling, laughing]

13:14.668 --> 13:18.130
That flight attendant must've taken them
all out of their baby seats.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.842
Marsha Krinkle and the guy who smells news
already spotted them.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.136
[Staci] Stay calm.
The babies are still happy.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.263
-[signal beeps]
-This is your captain speaking.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.099
-We are headed into some minor turbulence.
-[gasps]

13:29.183 --> 13:31.810
Please remain seated
with your safety belts securely fastened.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.271
And if you have little ones flying
with you today,

13:34.355 --> 13:37.107
ooh, boy, is everybody gonna hate you.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.776
-[rumbling]
-[cries]

13:39.109 --> 13:41.278
-[adults grumbling]
-[wailing]

13:41.362 --> 13:43.697
-Come on!
-Are you kidding me?

13:43.781 --> 13:44.782
[woman] Really?

13:44.865 --> 13:48.661
Flightmare: The Crying Baby-pocalypse.
That's our story.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.580
Roosevelt, camera.
This one's gonna go global.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.083
Hallelujah! We got news.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.085
Where's the inside man?

13:56.168 --> 13:57.378
[whimpering]

13:57.461 --> 13:58.837
He's busy with the beverage cart.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.257
I'll keep you out of his eyeline. Just go!

14:01.423 --> 14:03.717
Run past my row. You've got five seconds.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.974
[Staci] Duck left, row 21. Now!

14:12.893 --> 14:14.728
Two rows back. Now!

14:14.812 --> 14:16.772
-[grunts]
-Agh!

14:17.565 --> 14:19.066
[sobbing]

14:20.401 --> 14:21.652
Roosevelt, where's the camera?

14:21.735 --> 14:24.822
This baby is making news all over me.
What the--

14:28.951 --> 14:30.286
[scattered wailing]

14:32.621 --> 14:34.665
[Staci] He's coming. Bob and weave.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.917
-[grunts]
-[crying]

14:37.001 --> 14:37.835
Shh, shh!

14:37.918 --> 14:40.713
Shut 'em up faster.
He's headed right towards you.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.883
[crying continues]

14:45.801 --> 14:48.345
-[squeals]
-Shut it down!

14:48.429 --> 14:49.930
-[adults grumbling]
-Eh...?

14:50.014 --> 14:52.933
They're chain-reacting,
and I'm out of pacifiers.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.060
Improvise!

14:55.144 --> 14:56.604
[cart rumbles]

15:01.150 --> 15:02.234
[gasping, crying]

15:02.318 --> 15:03.777
I can't get to the last one.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.614
Grab the beverage cart
and pull it back six rows.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.740
What? Why?

15:07.823 --> 15:10.659
Oh, I don't know, because do it!

15:10.743 --> 15:11.994
There you go. Hey!

15:12.077 --> 15:13.329
Peel right.

15:15.789 --> 15:16.790
Huh?

15:16.874 --> 15:18.500
-[yelps]
-[clattering]

15:19.084 --> 15:19.919
[growls]

15:20.002 --> 15:24.548
No story this time, newslady.
You probably wanna clear out now.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.633
[gasps]

15:26.592 --> 15:30.054
-[woman] Oh! Oh, my goodness!
-[man] What are you-- Stop!

15:32.765 --> 15:33.766
[yawns]

15:35.768 --> 15:37.686
Gotcha! [groans]

15:38.062 --> 15:39.939
[Stevefan panting]

15:41.148 --> 15:42.942
May I have a ginger ale, please?

15:43.651 --> 15:44.777
[snarls]

15:46.195 --> 15:47.780
[soda can opens]

15:47.863 --> 15:48.822
[Stevefan growls]

15:49.698 --> 15:51.367
Do you have any straws?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.370
[paper rips]

15:56.246 --> 15:57.289
Thank you.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.041
[slurping]

16:01.919 --> 16:02.878
Ahhh!

16:02.962 --> 16:05.255
-[yelps]
-[Marsha] Top off my coffee, hon.

16:05.339 --> 16:09.426
Marsha Krinkle needs to be wired and ready
when those babies cut loose again.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.303
Right with you, ma'am.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.473
Try me, buckaroo.
I have got a "naughty boy jump seat"

16:14.556 --> 16:16.892
with your backside's name
written all over it!

16:19.895 --> 16:20.729
[groans]

16:25.859 --> 16:26.819
[yelps]

16:26.902 --> 16:29.530
He's onto me.
I think I should just lay low for--

16:29.697 --> 16:33.283
-[sighs] I knew this was coming.
-You knew what was coming?

16:33.367 --> 16:35.995
The part where you give up
because you're not really committed.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.123
What are you talking about?
I've been doing everything.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.250
But you're not gonna finish
what you started.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.836
I put my whole baby life into this,

16:43.919 --> 16:47.631
and then suddenly the boss joins a family
and gets a brother and,

16:47.715 --> 16:52.219
"Oohdy-doo, look at me. I'm Tim,
and I'm on the team, too. Whoo!"

16:52.302 --> 16:55.931
-I do not say, "Oohdy-doo."
-Do you even care about Baby Corp?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.725
-I--
-You know what? Forget it.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.935
-I can do this myself.
-Staci, wait!

17:00.019 --> 17:02.312
-Don't do anything stupid.
-Busted!

17:02.396 --> 17:03.772
[laughing]

17:04.690 --> 17:06.900
My pain is not funny.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.861
[laughs, snores]

17:10.029 --> 17:11.572
[Tim grunting]

17:13.615 --> 17:14.700
This isn't over.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.785
We're onto you, Steven.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.456
Stevefan!
Here's a trick to remember how to say it.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.334
I am wearing a name tag! [laughing]

17:25.127 --> 17:26.378
Okay? Bye-bye.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.464
[grunting]

17:30.132 --> 17:31.133
Staci?

17:31.216 --> 17:34.595
Okay, you were right.
I don't care about Baby Corp.

17:34.678 --> 17:38.182
Like the pie charts or who gets promoted.
[grunts]

17:38.265 --> 17:41.185
I just wanna help my brother.
We're on the same team.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.438
So, if you're out there, help me?

17:45.314 --> 17:46.190
[sighs]

17:47.816 --> 17:50.152
-[gasps]
-Baby like a shiny...

17:50.235 --> 17:54.448
-Like a shiny, shiny... gimme.
-You have to get back in your seat.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.367
If the inside man/flight attendant
sees you--

17:57.451 --> 18:00.704
Wait! Yes, get it, baby.
Get the shiny buckle.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.165
Yeah!

18:03.248 --> 18:04.958
-Thank you.
-[snoring]

18:05.042 --> 18:06.335
[murmuring]

18:06.418 --> 18:08.378
-[gasps]
-Staci!

18:09.129 --> 18:10.464
[crying]

18:13.675 --> 18:16.470
Okay, little missy.
Let's just stay in our--

18:16.553 --> 18:19.515
-[howls]
-[shrieks, screaming]

18:19.598 --> 18:20.766
[babbling]

18:20.849 --> 18:21.934
We won!

18:22.017 --> 18:23.102
It's over!

18:23.685 --> 18:26.271
-Why is your face like that?
-The flight attendant.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.691
As he was buckling me in,
he-- he gave me my bottle.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.402
What? I thought he wanted crying babies.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.948
-Unless...
-He wasn't the inside man.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.950
[faint rock music playing]

18:38.033 --> 18:40.661
What is your problem, kid?

18:40.744 --> 18:41.870
[yelps] You're not asleep?

18:42.454 --> 18:43.455
Norwegian metal.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.792
I've been awake the whole time,
trying to make babies cry.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.253
And you, gosh, you just keep interfering.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.672
But, you're a mom.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.717
Exactly.
I want what's best for my baby girl.

18:55.801 --> 19:00.556
So when some German guy calls and promises
to pay her future college tuition

19:00.639 --> 19:05.435
if this flight ends
with 13 screaming babies,

19:05.519 --> 19:10.023
well, then,
that's exactly what's gonna happen.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.318
-[gasps]
-[puffs]

19:13.402 --> 19:14.403
No!

19:14.486 --> 19:18.991
This is for you, Dakota.
You're going to Ohio State!

19:19.449 --> 19:20.534
-[pops]
-[gasps]

19:20.909 --> 19:22.619
[screams]

19:23.287 --> 19:25.539

-[adults protesting]

19:26.123 --> 19:28.083
[screaming]

19:30.002 --> 19:32.462
[grunts] I'm sorry. Chain-reacting.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.632
-I'm only so strong.
-Oh, no.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.135
[wails]

19:38.218 --> 19:39.845
[screaming]

19:42.514 --> 19:44.266
[gasping]

19:45.017 --> 19:46.101
Agh!

19:47.477 --> 19:50.898
Crying Baby-pocalypse! It's back on!

19:51.940 --> 19:55.694
It's news! [laughs] And it smells good!

19:56.403 --> 19:58.864
Get the camera. We roll in 30, 29...

19:58.947 --> 20:00.866
[cackling]

20:02.117 --> 20:03.327
[groaning]

20:04.036 --> 20:05.204
Whoa!

20:05.287 --> 20:06.121
Oof!

20:08.123 --> 20:09.041
[giggling]

20:09.124 --> 20:13.253
[gasps] I know how to fix this,
and it's gonna hurt.

20:13.337 --> 20:19.968
[Marsha] Twenty, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15...

20:20.052 --> 20:21.595
Attention, flight crew.

20:21.678 --> 20:24.806
I am out of my seat,
without a grown-up, again.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.768
You!

20:27.851 --> 20:30.437
I also took three bags of peanuts.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.439
[gasps] No!

20:32.522 --> 20:36.318
And I knew how to say "Stevefan"
all along.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.821
-I just said "Steven" to cheese you off.
-[squeals] No!

20:39.905 --> 20:41.698
Watch this, baby.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.283
[panting] Yah!

20:43.367 --> 20:44.409
Ugh!

20:44.660 --> 20:45.494
[giggles]

20:45.577 --> 20:48.664
That's right. My pain is funny.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.166
[voice trembling] Get back in your seat.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.252
-Never.
-[grunts]

20:53.585 --> 20:55.879
-Oof!
-[laughing]

20:56.380 --> 20:57.798
-Agh!
-[laughing]

20:58.173 --> 20:59.049
Ugh!

20:59.716 --> 21:00.717
-Uhn!
-[giggles]

21:00.801 --> 21:01.969
-Uh!
-[laughing]

21:02.052 --> 21:04.054
Three, two...

21:04.137 --> 21:05.514
[sobbing]

21:05.847 --> 21:07.808
-[babbling]
-Yay!

21:07.891 --> 21:10.560
One! Hi, Marsha Krinkle, Channel 8 News.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.645
Here with...

21:11.728 --> 21:12.604
[babies giggling]

21:12.688 --> 21:15.732
-[man] Aw, so sweet.
-[woman] Look how cute they are.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.526
Oh, dang!

21:17.609 --> 21:22.072
...the most adorable story
this news crew has ever witnessed.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.741
It's a Giggling Baby-pocalypse.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.951
[passengers gasping] Oh!

21:26.034 --> 21:27.536
But-- how did--?

21:27.619 --> 21:28.829
[Stevefan grunting]

21:30.205 --> 21:32.958
[whispers] I will never question
your commitment again.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.751
You're welcome. [grunts]

21:39.047 --> 21:43.677
[captain] Ladies and gentlemen,
bienvenue to Paris, France.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.679
[moans]

21:45.762 --> 21:47.556
[thumping]

21:47.848 --> 21:49.474
[grunting, thumping]

21:49.558 --> 21:52.269
