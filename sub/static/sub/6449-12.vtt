CHLOE:
No worries.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.470
Clark and l were just updating our
nonexistent Facebook pages in person.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.131
I don't know if you guys saw,
Watchtower just texted.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.972
I mean, Tess just texted
that Trotter and her men...

36:30.146 --> 36:32.888
...are enjoying a taste
of their own virtual venom.

36:33.399 --> 36:36.891
Since Trotter is off the military's grid,
we're not gonna have to worry...

36:37.111 --> 36:39.477
...about her spreading
her hero-hating vitriol...

36:39.655 --> 36:42.032
...or your secret anytime soon.

36:42.408 --> 36:43.523
Good.

36:43.701 --> 36:47.444
Hey, since we are, uh, all together
in the same room...

36:47.622 --> 36:49.658
...and the same plane of existence...

36:49.832 --> 36:52.744
...and with our lives
who knows how long that will be...

36:52.919 --> 36:55.535
...we wanted to ask you a question.

36:56.339 --> 36:59.251
I think what Lois is trying to say is,
do you—?

36:59.425 --> 37:01.131
Will you be my maid of honor?

37:23.491 --> 37:24.947
Oliver. They're beautiful.

37:27.370 --> 37:30.032
Yeah. Thought so.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.872
Think you might want
to, uh, put these in water.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.452
I'm sure they're real.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.581
I haven't been given ﬂowers like this
in a long time.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.548
I just stopped looking for you.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.846
I ﬁgured that's what you wanted.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.756
Rig ht?

37:58.109 --> 38:01.192
You have no idea how much it means
that you trusted me.

38:04.031 --> 38:06.317
You could've called me.

38:06.492 --> 38:10.030
You could've called me.
You could've said, uh....

38:10.871 --> 38:14.705
Yeah, I wanted to, but the Fate Helmet
warned me to stay away.

38:16.502 --> 38:20.711
Did the helmet, um, say anything
about how I'd be sitting alone...

38:20.881 --> 38:23.543
...listening to old voicemails
just to hear your voice?

38:23.718 --> 38:25.879
Anything like that, or, uh....

38:26.053 --> 38:29.386
Or that I'd be scanning every single
stranger's face on the subway...

38:29.557 --> 38:34.847
...just in hopes that I'd come across
your smile, never to ﬁnd it?

38:36.772 --> 38:41.141
No, it didn't tell me that.
I ﬁgured that out on my own.

38:43.738 --> 38:47.447
Oliver, I didn't reach out to you
because I didn't trust myself.

38:47.616 --> 38:51.609
I knew that if I looked into your eyes
or felt your breath on my cheek...

38:51.787 --> 38:55.405
...there is no way I would have
walked out that front door.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.748
There hasn't been a day
that's gone by...

38:58.919 --> 39:03.037
...that I haven't dreamed about the time
when I would walk through it again.

39:09.096 --> 39:11.428
You sticking around for a while?

39:14.685 --> 39:15.765
Yeah.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.776
Good.

[CH UCKLES]

40:07.071 --> 40:10.154
I ﬁnished picking out the ﬂowers
and the bridesmaids' dresses.

40:10.324 --> 40:12.736
You can come back in the house now.

40:13.369 --> 40:16.202
-ls that Carter's book?
-Yeah.

40:16.372 --> 40:19.330
I've been thinking a lot
about him lately.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.325
He would be proud of you, Clark.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.417
I've been thinking
about what you said.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.382
I should shut my eyes
and my ears to the outside world...

40:30.553 --> 40:32.714
...to ﬁgure out what's true.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.642
You made me believe...

40:40.896 --> 40:42.227
...and you got me to ﬂy...

40:44.775 --> 40:47.767
...even if it was just in cyberspace.

40:49.822 --> 40:50.902
Mm.

40:51.657 --> 40:54.649
Well, I have to say,
that soaring over the Daily Planet...

40:54.869 --> 40:58.782
...and the spires of Metropolis
was amazing.

40:59.915 --> 41:01.371
Well, who knows?

41:01.542 --> 41:04.375
Maybe one day we'll get to ﬂy
in the real world.

41:07.006 --> 41:10.089
I've always believed
that you can do the impossible.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.465
And one day, you will.

41:17.057 --> 41:22.177
And speaking of the real world, I have
a conference call with Perry at 7.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.428
See you.
