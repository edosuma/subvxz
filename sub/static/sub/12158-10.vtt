00:03.103 --> 00:04.169
<i>"Last Man Standing"</i>
<i>is recorded</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:05.704
<i>In front of a live</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

00:05.706 --> 00:07.973
Ah, thanks, Ryan.
That was an amazing dinner.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.675
It was amazing
you paid for it.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.176
I didn't realize
you had a wallet.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.013
We wanted
to pay you guys back

00:14.015 --> 00:15.948
For always helping out
so much with Boyd.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.017
That one dinner was payback
for five years

00:18.019 --> 00:20.319
Of watching your kid
and paying for everything?

00:20.321 --> 00:21.987
I should have ordered
the steak

00:21.989 --> 00:25.090
With a side
of gold doubloons.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.196
Dad, why are you watching
the wedding channel?

00:31.198 --> 00:32.798
You got seven remotes.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.567
I've been hitting buttons
for an hour.

00:35.569 --> 00:39.838
Well, that explains
why the garage door is open.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.373
How long
has he been out?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.643
Since right before taneesha
said yes to that dress.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.179
Did Boyd
behave himself?

00:47.181 --> 00:49.915
Oh, yes.
He was a very good boy.

00:49.917 --> 00:50.916
Oh, good.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.085
I just had to spank him
the one time.

00:55.188 --> 00:58.257
-- Captions by vitac --

01:02.028 --> 01:03.762
You spanked my son?

01:03.764 --> 01:06.532
Bud, I-I really don't think
you should have done that.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.567
Oh, it's all right.
My shoulder's fine.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.671
I-I just gave him
the one quick swat.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.106
What exactly happened,
bud?

01:14.108 --> 01:16.842
I told him to bring his plate
into the kitchen.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.510
He said, "make me."

01:18.512 --> 01:19.611
And I did.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.082
By the way,
the kid broke a plate.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.252
G-grandpa,
we never hit Boyd.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.089
That explains
why he looked so surprised.

01:30.091 --> 01:33.358
We don't control Boyd
with anger and fear, okay?

01:33.360 --> 01:35.928
We prefer
a-a reward-punishment system.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.596
They have a chart
with stickers.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.399
Nothing puts the fear of god
in a kid

01:40.401 --> 01:43.302
More than
a yellow frowny face.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.537
All right, well,
I inspected Boyd's behind.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.439
This incident
didn't leave any scars.

01:47.441 --> 01:51.810
Except the fact that his dad
inspected his behind.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.415
Boyd, sweetie, grandpa bud
made a big, big mistake, okay?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.917
And we promise that no one
will ever spank you again.

01:58.919 --> 01:59.952
All right,
enough with this.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.254
I'm not a big fan
of spanking, either, dad,

02:02.256 --> 02:04.389
But let's not throw all options
out the window

02:04.391 --> 02:05.791
Like obama
with the iranians.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.993
"no matter what you do,
we're not gonna bomb you.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.496
Go ahead."
oh, really, Mike?
There's a country out there

02:10.498 --> 02:12.664
That this drone-loving president
hasn't bombed yet?

02:12.666 --> 02:13.765
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.933
You can't attack him
from the left.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.335
That would mean
I've got to defend him.

02:17.937 --> 02:20.606
Okay, you know, maybe we should
just get Boyd home, yeah?

02:20.608 --> 02:21.773
I don't
want to go home!

02:21.775 --> 02:23.942
I want to watch tv
with grandpa bud!

02:23.944 --> 02:26.111
We were watching
this show about bras

02:26.113 --> 02:28.180
Till I pressed
the wrong button.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.750
And in case
anybody was worried,

02:31.752 --> 02:34.386
This one
seemed very interested.

02:35.421 --> 02:36.655
I want to stay!

02:36.657 --> 02:37.756
Boyd, if you cooperate,

02:37.758 --> 02:39.324
I promise we'll get you
some froyo.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.859
Froyo!
Froyo! Froyo!

02:40.861 --> 02:41.927
Look at that kid.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.096
I remember being excited
about things.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.797
Good night, you guys.
Thanks for dinner.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.933
Yeah, thanks for dinner.
Drive safe, all right?

02:47.935 --> 02:50.669
And that is the reason
Boyd has a discipline problem.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.038
Every time he acts up,
they just bribe him with sugar.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.606
You know,
I never bribed the girls

02:54.608 --> 02:56.008
Or used spanking
as punishment.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.676
You know,
that's just lazy parenting.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.677
I get it, michael.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.479
You don't want me
spanking the kid.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.114
No, I just don't think
it should be

03:02.116 --> 03:03.448
The only tool
in the toolbox,

03:03.450 --> 03:04.816
Like it was
with jimmy and me.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.818
You saying
that I'm a lousy father?

03:06.820 --> 03:09.121
I didn't say "lousy."
"lazy" is what I said.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.857
I never had to do that
with the girls.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.991
I just had to go with
the look.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.893
You get the, "oh..."

03:16.896 --> 03:19.198
Well, that might have worked
with the girls,

03:19.200 --> 03:21.900
But it wouldn't have slowed down
you and your brother.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.635
You two were hell-raisers.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.705
Uh, can I ask you something,
Vanessa?
Yes.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.141
Does Mike pick up his socks?
Yes.

03:29.143 --> 03:32.444
You're welcome.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.051
Honey, honey, you were
a little hard on your father.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.419
I think you hurt
his feelings.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.588
Dad doesn't have
any feelings.

03:42.590 --> 03:46.758
He's 99% gristle.
The rest is fake hip.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.061
Yeah, well, you called him
a lazy parent

03:49.063 --> 03:51.730
Because he -- he spanked
you and jimmy once or twice.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.398
More than once or twice.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.035
He's the reason I can't put
a wallet in my back pocket.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.037
So you think
bud crossed the line?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.339
No, it was the '60s.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.008
Minorities wanted their rights.
Women wanted their rights.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.611
Somebody
was gonna get smacked.

04:05.613 --> 04:09.114
You know, I occasionally spanked
when the girls were little.
I know.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.749
Does that make me
a lazy parent?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.718
I never said anything
about that at the time

04:12.720 --> 04:15.020
'cause I was afraid
that you'd come after me.
Oh!

04:24.530 --> 04:27.299
Now, you're probably gonna
run into a bear out there,

04:27.301 --> 04:28.533
And they're dangerous.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.602
So the most important thing
to remember

04:30.604 --> 04:32.204
Is to never, ever --

04:32.206 --> 04:33.538
Mandy: Hey, baby.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.640
Oh, there's my girlfriend.
Excuse me.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.110
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Hi.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.611
Well, I was shopping
at the mall,

04:39.613 --> 04:41.580
And I saw something
that made me think of you.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.383
Was it that guy at the kiosk
who sells cellphone cases?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.418
Because he looks
just like me.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.787
Except he's got
way more phone cases.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.456
No. It was this.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.258
This made you think
of me?

04:53.260 --> 04:55.994
Mm-hmm. 'cause you're gonna look
really good wearing it.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.296
How do you know?

04:57.298 --> 04:59.064
I got the phone-case guy
to try it on.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.265
Let me see.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.400
[ gasps ]

05:01.402 --> 05:02.968
Oh, my god!
Shut up!

05:05.104 --> 05:07.105
Hey, I got a question
for you.
Uh-huh.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.740
How do you feel
about spanking?

05:08.742 --> 05:12.544
Well, it can spice up
a relationship.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.248
A little advice, though.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.583
Write down your safe word.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.086
I'm talking about
spanking kids.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.588
Thanks
for that mental picture.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.091
See, I never spanked my kids,
but then again,

05:26.093 --> 05:28.293
I wasn't around much
when they were small.

05:28.295 --> 05:30.095
I mean,
it would be kind of weird

05:30.097 --> 05:32.431
Just to come in swinging,
you know.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.199
Never stopped bing crosby.

05:35.601 --> 05:37.336
My dad was watching Boyd
last night.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.537
Evidently
he spanked him.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.205
I said something
about it.

05:40.207 --> 05:43.275
And the wife thinks I might have
hurt my dad's feelings.

05:43.277 --> 05:44.710
What did you say?

05:44.712 --> 05:46.378
I said
it was lazy parenting.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.547
And you told him
he was a terrible father.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.782
No, I didn't say that.
That's what he heard.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.451
I think you're making
too much of this.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.319
You're saying
that I'm a doddering old fool,

05:54.321 --> 05:55.887
Doesn't know
what he's talking about.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.957
I didn't say that.
That's what <i>I</i> heard.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.128
Mike, sometimes you don't know
how you come off.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.564
I'll have a chat
with my dad.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.566
You don't want to leave
something like that
hanging in the air.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.068
You don't know how much longer
he's gonna be around.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.337
Hmm. So what you're saying
is if I wait long enough,

06:12.339 --> 06:14.806
The problem
will take care of itself.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.408
Tallahassee!
What?

06:16.410 --> 06:18.310
My safe word.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.147
Hold the phone, mikey.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.083
You want to see something
hilarious?

06:25.085 --> 06:28.587
Every time you say something's
hilarious, it never is.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.255
Until now.

06:32.258 --> 06:33.759
All right,
what's the play here, huh?

06:33.761 --> 06:36.094
Do we ignore
the stupid hat

06:36.096 --> 06:37.929
So we can laugh
every time we see it?

06:37.931 --> 06:39.398
Or do we mention the hat

06:39.400 --> 06:41.733
And run the risk
of him taking it off?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.902
Sophie's choice.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.071
Kyle,
come in here, please.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.572
You ready?

06:47.574 --> 06:48.740
Mm-hmm.
Here we go.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.075
Hey, Kyle.
Come on in.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.076
Sirs.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.110
[ chuckles ]

06:52.112 --> 06:54.112
Son, maybe you can help
Mike and me

06:54.114 --> 06:55.680
With
a marketing problem.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.748
Sure.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.950
Yes, w-we need
a research ambassador.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.187
We're having trouble reaching
the douchebag population.

07:04.223 --> 07:07.125
And if you're not too busy
making your special blue meth...

07:07.127 --> 07:09.428
I get it.
This is about my new ha--

07:09.430 --> 07:10.829
Hold on a second.
I'm not done yet.

07:12.698 --> 07:14.466
Old-timer,
you want to go down to the park

07:14.468 --> 07:16.401
And play some checkers?

07:16.403 --> 07:17.803
I've got a good one.

07:17.805 --> 07:21.106
Buster keaton called,
says he wants his hat back.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.140
[ chuckles ]

07:22.142 --> 07:23.942
Eh?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.311
Boy, there was
a fresh reference.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.713
Well,
I'm getting back to work.

07:28.715 --> 07:29.815
Ed.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.116
Kid rock.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.417
[ chuckles ]

07:32.419 --> 07:35.454
I knew you guys would give me
the business about my hat.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.656
Mandy's really excited
for me to wear it.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.558
Yeah, of course.
Of course she is.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.093
Yeah, she's planting her flag
on top of your head.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.895
If another woman
approaches you,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.764
The first thing
she's gonna ask is,

07:45.766 --> 07:47.332
"where did you get
the hat?"

07:47.334 --> 07:48.700
Oh, my girlfriend
gave it to me.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.336
Oh!

07:51.338 --> 07:53.004
That's what she's up to.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.740
Oh, yeah.
She's branded you like a cow.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.977
That hat
tells every woman on earth

07:58.979 --> 08:01.112
That this guy is taken.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.081
It's like she's got me
wrapped around her finger.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.349
That's right, kid.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.817
And I...Love it!

08:05.819 --> 08:06.885
[ chuckles ]

08:07.954 --> 08:09.588
I'll take it!

08:09.590 --> 08:10.622
Back off, girls.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.357
Property of Mandy
coming through.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.298
Hey, you two.
Staying for dinner?

08:20.300 --> 08:23.435
No, thanks.
I just had two candy bars.

08:23.437 --> 08:25.670
Wow. Two candy bars.
You know what?

08:25.672 --> 08:28.306
That's exactly
what I'm making for dinner.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.641
Boyd, sweetie, honey,

08:29.643 --> 08:31.710
Uh, why don't you run upstairs
and play, okay?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.546
Remember, mommy loves you
very, very, very much!

08:34.548 --> 08:36.715
I am
the worst mother ever.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.384
Oh, honey, stop.
Candy bars aren't so bad.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.621
Once for dinner, I fed you
a handful of breath mints.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.956
No, today
I-I-I lost my temper,

08:44.958 --> 08:46.725
And I-I did something --

08:46.727 --> 08:49.394
Something
I never thought that --

08:49.396 --> 08:52.397
Mom, I spanked Boyd.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.399
You spanked Boyd?

08:54.401 --> 08:56.234
What did he do?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.970
Gave me the most profound
look of betrayal

08:58.972 --> 09:01.006
I have ever seen
in my life.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.908
Why did you spank Boyd?

09:02.910 --> 09:04.876
W-we were in the parking lot
at whole foods...

09:04.878 --> 09:06.378
Mm-hmm.
...And I-I looked away
for one second,

09:06.380 --> 09:08.013
And -- and he ran out
in front of a car,

09:08.015 --> 09:09.915
So I grabbed him
and I smacked him on the butt.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.249
I-I don't know
what came over me.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.585
Maternal instinct --
that's what came over you.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.820
Honey, you were being
a very good mother.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.722
You protected your son
from death,

09:17.724 --> 09:20.692
And you bought him
overpriced organic produce.

09:20.694 --> 09:21.927
Hmm?

09:21.929 --> 09:23.828
Don't worry about it.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.864
I would have done
exactly the same thing.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.332
Yeah,
I know you would, mom.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.934
That's what makes it
even worse.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.702
What?

09:30.704 --> 09:31.937
Don't you understand?

09:31.939 --> 09:34.105
Okay, you -- you hit me.
I hit Boyd.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.775
We are perpetuating
a cycle of violence, okay?

09:36.777 --> 09:39.244
Someday, Boyd
will probably hit his kids.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.279
This family
will never know peace.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.616
So -- so you hitting Boyd
is somehow my fault?

09:44.618 --> 09:46.618
B-but you're a victim
as much as I am.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.420
Okay, I'm sure
your folks hit you.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.056
Kristin, I spanked you
maybe a total of twice,

09:51.058 --> 09:52.357
And that's not a cycle.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.458
That's restraint.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.761
Hey, mom.
What's for dinner?

09:56.763 --> 09:59.898
Apparently a legacy
of parental abuse.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.299
And salad.

10:01.301 --> 10:05.203
And if you're still hungry,
there's tic tacs in my purse.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.740
I don't really get
this new diet she's on.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.408
No, no.
Mom is just upset

10:10.410 --> 10:13.211
Because I confronted her
about what she did to us.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.245
Good.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.314
Somebody needs to call her
on her crap.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.483
What did she do to us?

10:18.485 --> 10:20.685
You know,
how she used to spank us.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.322
Spank us?
You mean at scrabble?

10:24.324 --> 10:26.157
She must have spanked me
in the head,

10:26.159 --> 10:27.959
'cause I don't remember
any of this.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.062
You're telling me
mom never swatted your butts?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.497
[ laughs ]
"butts."

10:32.499 --> 10:34.566
W-w-what about
all those times

10:34.568 --> 10:36.835
That she would drag you
into your room with a hairbrush?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.136
She was brushing my hair.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.904
You were screaming
and crying.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.440
Yeah,
'cause there were tangles.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.909
Was I the only one
mom ever spanked?

10:44.911 --> 10:47.512
She does high-five
really hard.
Yeah.

10:47.514 --> 10:50.782
Oh, I saw her swat muffin once
with a newspaper,

10:50.784 --> 10:53.952
So maybe you guys
could form a support group!

10:53.954 --> 10:55.654
[ sighs ]

10:55.656 --> 10:57.756
"hello, everyone,
my name is muffin,

10:57.758 --> 10:59.557
And I'm a victim
of spanking."

11:01.661 --> 11:02.827
Unbelievable.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.763
You know,
it -- I --

11:04.765 --> 11:06.164
Hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:06.166 --> 11:10.101
There was this one time
she, uh...

11:10.103 --> 11:12.037
No, that was a hug.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.439
[ laughs ]

11:21.514 --> 11:23.782
[ knock on door ]

11:23.784 --> 11:24.849
Hey, dad.

11:24.851 --> 11:25.850
Son.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.885
Knew it was you.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.787
You're the only one
that still knocks.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.854
We have a doorbell.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.356
Oh, forgive me
for trying to save you

11:31.358 --> 11:32.791
A couple of bucks
on electricity.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.228
I left my nicotine gum here
the other night.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.396
I really need it

11:38.398 --> 11:41.232
Since I switched
to those light cigarettes.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.001
So that's
what that is.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.303
I thought it was a chiclet
that had gone bad.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.439
Explains why I couldn't stop
chewing it.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.575
It's a pretty good game.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.877
Want to stick around
and watch?

11:52.879 --> 11:55.213
I guess.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.315
You know,
the other night,

11:57.317 --> 11:59.918
When I was talking
about spanking,

11:59.920 --> 12:02.654
I think you might have taken me
the wrong way.

12:02.656 --> 12:04.155
You were pretty clear.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.490
I hit you too much.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.925
Open that, would you?

12:06.927 --> 12:11.596
Look...You spanked us
and we knew why.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.398
You know, you never took it
too far, dad.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.901
Well, I wasn't giving you
my fastball.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.504
I'm just saying, it was nothing
we didn't deserve.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.073
Kids shouldn't be
throwing each other out windows,

12:22.075 --> 12:24.442
Lighting each other
on fire,

12:24.444 --> 12:26.344
Or stealing a car.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.079
You stole my car?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.682
That's how we got the dent
in the bonneville?

12:30.684 --> 12:32.584
No.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.918
That's where jimmy landed

12:33.920 --> 12:35.820
When I tossed him
out the window.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.924
You did a great job
raising us.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.392
Eh.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.528
I-I've been thinking
about it, too.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.097
I really did some damage
with that hitting.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.099
It's my fault
how you turned out.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.202
What, uh, smart, handsome,
and successful?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.773
No.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.242
You know...Sensitive.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.577
"sensitive"?
You mean insensitive.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.714
Vanessa's always complaining
about something.

13:02.716 --> 13:06.684
If I were sensitive,
I could tell you what it was.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.455
Son,
I was too rough on you,

13:10.457 --> 13:13.391
And as a result,
you can't spank your own kids.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.827
That's called
self-control, dad.

13:15.829 --> 13:16.828
I'm sorry.

13:16.830 --> 13:20.064
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.633
I know you got
a lot of them.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.134
What are you
talking about?

13:23.136 --> 13:26.571
I remember once, you wrote
this poem about a flower.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.840
What are you --

13:28.842 --> 13:31.810
It was a school project.
You had to write about a flower.

13:31.812 --> 13:35.980
But you didn't have to get
an "a."

13:37.750 --> 13:41.686
It's all right, son.
I love you just the way you are.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.121
Sensitive.

Ah!
Oh, there's my big guy.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.597
Hi, dude.
How was your day?

13:52.599 --> 13:53.765
We went to whole foods.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.834
Anything exciting
happen there?

13:55.836 --> 13:57.969
What? Why would anything happen
at whole foods?

13:57.971 --> 14:01.039
Uh, I don't know.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.041
You know, they're always doing
great new stuff with soy.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.010
Hey, do you think
your mom would mind

14:06.012 --> 14:07.779
If I made myself a little
sandwich before I leave?

14:07.781 --> 14:09.814
I think she'd be shocked
if you didn't.

14:09.816 --> 14:10.882
Boyd, hey, honey.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.116
Sweetie, come here
for a sec, okay?

14:12.118 --> 14:14.118
Listen,
I was thinking,

14:14.120 --> 14:15.887
And maybe
we shouldn't tell daddy

14:15.889 --> 14:17.889
About what happened today
at the store.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.624
You mean the two ladies
in man clothes

14:19.626 --> 14:20.625
That were kissing?

14:20.627 --> 14:23.194
Oh, no, no.
No, honey.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.064
T-that was beautiful, okay?
And natural.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.200
I-I mean -- I mean
how you ran away from me

14:29.202 --> 14:31.536
And I gave you
a little spank.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.972
You and daddy promised
you'd never do that.

But --
but talking about it

just upset daddy, so --

14:39.746 --> 14:41.145
Okay.
I won't tell him.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.081
Thank you!
Oh, you're the best.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.315
Can we get ice cream?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.484
No, honey.
It's too close to dinner.

14:46.486 --> 14:50.255
I think you should get me
some ice cream.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.258

14:55.228 --> 14:56.861
You said you wouldn't
say anything.

When he wants me
to do something.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.399
Unbelievable.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.102
Okay, I gave you two candy bars.
You said we were good.

15:04.104 --> 15:07.505
A-and this is what comes from
you constantly bribing our son.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.675
Now Boyd won't obey me
unless I give him ice cream.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.943
Okay.
All right.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.746
Boyd, if you promise to stop
asking for ice cream,

15:14.748 --> 15:16.447
Daddy will get you
sorbet.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.448

15:17.450 --> 15:20.618
Really? Sorbet?

15:20.620 --> 15:23.087
Well,
it's not ice cream.

from getting hit,
and then you hit him?

should be having this argument

No.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.981
Dad, was that
really necessary?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.749
Uh, actually,
I think it was.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.250
Listen, I'm only
gonna say this once.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.252
And you do not
want to upset him,

16:28.254 --> 16:29.988
Or he'll draw you
a flower.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.525
You're making too much
out of this spanking thing.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.327
I am not making
too much of this.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.863
People
keep spanking my son.

Mahatma gandhi once said --
shut up!

16:40.767 --> 16:42.266
Listen.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.102
You didn't do anything wrong
when you spanked Boyd

Or when you spanked Kris
or when you spanked me,

16:46.339 --> 16:48.840
And I didn't do anything wrong
when I didn't spank anybody.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.109
Nobody here
is a bad parent.

16:51.111 --> 16:51.943
Well, thank you, Mike.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.711
Except you.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.115
How do you discipline a kid
with ice cream?

16:57.117 --> 16:59.050
Our system works
for our family.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.618
But not in this family
right here.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.720

this house right now.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.389
Yeah,
dad is completely right.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.656
Of course he is.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.425
He feels things more deeply
than the rest of us.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.562
Look,
parenting is hard.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.165
We're all trying to figure
this stuff out as we go,

17:14.167 --> 17:16.467
And there's no book
to tell you how to do it.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.302
There are literally
thousands of books.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.372
What book
do you guys parent with --

17:21.374 --> 17:23.341
"how to raise a kid"
by ben and jerry?

17:23.343 --> 17:25.243
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.812
You know, I-I guess I just don't
like disappointing my son.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.248
I was out of his life
for three years,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.817
And that just makes me
want to spoil him.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.420
Well, that's not
what parenting's all about.

17:35.422 --> 17:39.023
That's what
grandparenting's about.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.224
You're not his friend.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.560
If your kid likes
how he's being disciplined,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.395
You're probably
doing it wrong.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.498
Okay. Fine.
No more bribing.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.067
But no more spanking,
either.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.068
Agreed.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.369
Okay, but when he does
something wrong,

17:51.371 --> 17:53.271
There has to be
some sort of consequence.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.106
And he's not gonna like
the consequence.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.909
You got to be all right
with that.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.678
You know what I like
about football?

18:00.680 --> 18:03.681
That you can bring it up
in the middle of a conversation

18:03.683 --> 18:05.750
That has nothing to do
with anything?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.685
There are clear rules

18:07.687 --> 18:09.387
And penalties
when you break them.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.255
Remember when the refs
went on strike?

18:11.257 --> 18:12.790
The scabs
didn't know the rules,

18:12.792 --> 18:14.092
There was chaos
on the field,

18:14.094 --> 18:17.829
And I lost $400
on that packers-seahawks game.

18:18.897 --> 18:19.931
Sorry. I'm --

18:19.933 --> 18:21.632
Yeah, I'm really new
to football, so...

18:21.634 --> 18:24.502
Son, you can't be afraid
to throw a flag.

18:26.972 --> 18:30.408
Boyd is looking at you
to enforce the rules.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.410
And when you do,
he'll be happy.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.245
You'll both be happy.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.246
Okay.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.814
Thank you both.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.118
Nice work.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.655
Not bad for my first try
at being sensitive.

18:54.566 --> 18:55.766
Hey!
Hey.

18:55.768 --> 18:56.901
[ gasps ]

18:56.903 --> 18:59.003
Ooh! I like
that you're wearing your hat.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.471
Of course I am.
I love it.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.073
In fact,
I got you a little

19:02.075 --> 19:03.908
"thank you for my present"
present.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.510
Oh, my god!
I-it's not a hat.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.078
I shouldn't ruin
the surprise.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.614
It might be a hat.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.948
It's not a hat.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.450
Oh, my god.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.918
You went out
and got me something

19:13.920 --> 19:15.253
Just 'cause
I got you something?

19:15.255 --> 19:16.787
Yeah,
I know I didn't have to.
No, no, no, no!

19:16.789 --> 19:20.291
Let's, like,
make this our thing, you know?

19:20.293 --> 19:21.926
[ squealing ]
I'm so excited!

19:21.928 --> 19:23.561
Oh, my god.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.098
Hmm.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.333
"Mandy & Kyle."

19:29.335 --> 19:31.202
Oh, you shouldn't have.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.603
Do you like it?

19:32.605 --> 19:34.772
No. That's why I said,
"you shouldn't have."

19:34.774 --> 19:38.042
I knew I should have sprung
for the real rhinestones.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.778
I-I got that for you

19:40.780 --> 19:42.713
For the same reason
you got me my hat.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.448
I'm marking you
as my property.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.120
I'm branding you --
like a cow.

19:50.956 --> 19:53.391
I didn't give you the hat
'cause I wanted to mark you.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.227
You weren't telling other girls
to back off?

19:56.229 --> 19:57.862
Well, no.
I mean, I got you that hat

19:57.864 --> 19:59.597
'cause I don't really like
your style.

20:01.233 --> 20:02.567
What's wrong
with my style?

20:02.569 --> 20:05.503
Okay, honey, the way
that you dress is like,

20:05.505 --> 20:07.004
Um...

20:07.006 --> 20:11.776
Like if a lumberjack
and a drifter had a baby.

20:13.545 --> 20:17.748
And then you asked for
fashion advice from that baby.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.917
So you're saying
I'm not good enough the way I am

20:19.919 --> 20:21.052
And you want to change me?

20:21.054 --> 20:22.486
Yes.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.889
All right!
[ chuckles ]

20:26.225 --> 20:28.526
You like me so much,
you want to change me!
Yeah.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.861
I always knew I wasn't good
enough, but now you can fix me.

20:30.863 --> 20:31.862
Yes!

20:31.864 --> 20:33.097
Yes!

20:33.099 --> 20:35.700
So the first thing
we're gonna do is return this

20:35.702 --> 20:38.436
And buy more stuff
to make you amazing!

20:38.438 --> 20:40.371
[ chuckles ]

20:40.373 --> 20:42.073
Hey, do I know you?

20:42.075 --> 20:43.941
Yeah. Susan.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.743
We live next door
to each other.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.944
Kyle.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.779
You kept throwing your garbage
through my window.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.248
You thought
it was a trash chute.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.415
Oh, yeah.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.451
Yeah, the guy that lives
down the trash chute.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.352
Yeah.
[ chuckles ]

20:55.587 --> 20:56.621
I really like your hat.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.955
Thanks.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.724
Well,
I'll see you around, Kyle.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.025
Stop by sometime.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.393
All right.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.928
[ chuckles ]

21:03.930 --> 21:05.263
She's pretty.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.566
I think she's
on a beer poster.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.234
All right,
should we get to the mall

21:10.236 --> 21:11.569
And turn me
into a dreamboat?

21:11.571 --> 21:14.572
Yeah, give me that hat.
We're not going to the mall.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.606
Why?

21:15.608 --> 21:16.607
Because!

21:16.609 --> 21:18.309
You need to save
your money

21:18.311 --> 21:21.112
So you can move out
of that apartment.

21:23.148 --> 21:25.116
Could this day
get any better?

21:25.118 --> 21:26.984
I'm getting
a new apartment,

21:26.986 --> 21:29.287
And I get to stop by
susan's later.
