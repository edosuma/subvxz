01:47.420 --> 01:49.490
Three women murdered inside
a gated community

01:49.500 --> 01:51.877
in southeastern New Mexico
in the last two months.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.495
All three inside.

01:54.710 --> 01:56.530
Marjorie West was strangled
in her home

01:56.540 --> 01:58.496
in the middle of the night
while her family was out of town.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.706
They found her the next morning.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.416
Jill Long was strangled
in the laundry room

02:02.420 --> 02:05.537
while her husband and sons
were camping in the backyard.

02:05.540 --> 02:08.577
And last night, Aubrey Jacobs
was killed in her home office

02:08.580 --> 02:11.208
while her daughter and husband
were asleep in the house.

02:11.210 --> 02:13.326
Occupied dwellings is
as high-risk as it gets.

02:13.330 --> 02:15.321
-l_-le_'s fearless.
-PrOXImIty, the chance

02:15.330 --> 02:17.821
he might get caught,
that could be part of it for him.

02:17.830 --> 02:20.162
You said gated community.
I'm assuming that means security?

02:20.170 --> 02:21.956
A small security staff
and perimeter cameras.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.497
Everything's recorded 24/7,
and no one has entered

02:24.500 --> 02:27.071
or left the compound since last night,
except residents.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.571
It looks like the UnSub
is part of the community.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.668
The local detective says that
demographics, general makeup,

02:32.670 --> 02:34.615
and socioeconomic status
of the resrdents

02:34.620 --> 02:35.871
is essentially the same.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.575
That's going to make a profile difficult.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.070
_ Unless we examine
a different set of parameters.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.288
-Different parameters?
-Rossi's working on that right now.

02:47.420 --> 02:48.990
What took you so long, cadet?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.570
What took you so long? Here you go.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.241
The mannequin is
your wounded partner.

02:52.250 --> 02:55.913
You and your wounded partner
must make it over that wall.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.535
Where's your head at, cadet

02:57.540 --> 02:59.167
Let's move! Let's move!

02:59.170 --> 03:00.956
Use the rope to get
your partner over the wall.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.325
Let's move!

03:05.420 --> 03:07.285
Use the rope to get your partner
over the wall, cadet.

03:07.290 --> 03:09.576
Are you paying attention Where's your head at?

03:10.250 --> 03:12.787
Get your partner over the wall.
Here we go.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.746
Move, cadet! Move, cadet!

03:14.750 --> 03:16.206
There you go! There you go!

03:16.210 --> 03:18.030
Watch her. That's how you do it!

03:18.040 --> 03:20.167
That's how you do it, cadet!

03:20.960 --> 03:23.110
There you go! Yes! Yes!

03:23.960 --> 03:27.578
That's about the_fastest I've ever seen
anyone fIgure that out.

03:27.580 --> 03:30.378
Is this the first time
she's ever done that?

03:30.380 --> 03:32.416
Change the task every day.

03:38.420 --> 03:40.069
-Agent Seaver.
-Sir.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.618
You remember SSA Rossi
from the Behavioral Analysis Unit?

03:44.210 --> 03:46.826
-Of course. _
-It's been qurte a long time.

03:47.790 --> 03:49.872
-Yes, sir.
-You weren't easy to find.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.871
You're supposed to be
working the reception desk

03:51.880 --> 03:53.666
at the Washington Field Office.

03:53.670 --> 03:55.615
I'm on my break.

03:55.620 --> 03:58.327
I was told that _I could run the course
In my free tIme If I wanted to.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.036
-My concussion...
-At ease.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.668
If this is how you want to spend
your free time, you have at it.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.706
I'm gonna let the two of you talk. Dave.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.496
-Thanks, Bill.
-Yeah.

04:11.620 --> 04:14.532
I know you're too busy to just visit.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.957
I want to show you something.

04:20.170 --> 04:22.821
Because of my impressive
Academy scores

04:23.250 --> 04:24.820
or my childhood?

04:26.920 --> 04:28.569
Let's take a ride.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.071
-You remember Agent Hotchner?
-Yes, of course.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.161
-Good to see you.
-Hi.

04:37.170 --> 04:38.785
-Glad to see you're doing so well.
-Thank you.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.200
-Have a seat.
-Yes, Sir.

04:41.830 --> 04:43.286
I told Ashley

04:43.620 --> 04:46.703
that she may be able
to help us with this case.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.072
We have an UnSub who manages
to live in close proximity to his victims

04:51.080 --> 04:52.741
without raising an alarm.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.741
That we've seen before.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.615
What's new here is _
what the local police are telling us

04:56.620 --> 04:58.576
about the community itself.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.617
Demographically,
everyone's basically the same.

05:01.620 --> 05:03.611
Most of the parameters
we would look for to build a profile

05:03.620 --> 05:05.030
seem to exist in most of the men.

05:05.710 --> 05:07.416
But we thought
if the UnSub has children,

05:08.250 --> 05:10.878
and the statistics tell us
that he probably does,

05:10.880 --> 05:13.997
would the children exhibit
certain specific behavior?

05:14.960 --> 05:17.281
So, this isn't about my academic scores.

05:18.670 --> 05:19.705
No.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.282
Great. Give me 15 minutes.
I have a change of clothes in the car.

05:24.290 --> 05:27.077
Agent, we're not
detailing you to the unit.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.741
We want to ask you some questions.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.036
Right. I see.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.206
Do you have some concerns?

05:37.830 --> 05:40.617
I want to help, and I know that I can.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.281
But I don't think
I can tell you what to look for

05:44.290 --> 05:46.611
without seeing the families myself.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.919
You understand you'd go only
as a consultant on this one case?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.615
-I understand.
-And you're to do nothing

05:54.620 --> 05:55.996
without another member
of the team present.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.069
Yes, sir.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.741
This won't be easy, Ashley.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.822
It may trigger
some extremely painful memories.

06:04.170 --> 06:06.377
I appreciate the concern,

06:06.380 --> 06:09.668
but when your father kills 25 women
before you're a teenager,

06:09.670 --> 06:12.377
painful memories don't need a trigger.

06:12.380 --> 06:13.870
They just are.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.871
"When we were children,
we used to think that when we grew up

06:50.880 --> 06:52.996
"we would no longer be vulnerable.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.162
"To be alive is to be vulnerable."

06:58.170 --> 07:00.161
Writer Madeleine L'Engle.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.917
I'ye notified _
the prImary detective

07:02.920 --> 07:05.662
and the Oak Tree Hills Security Office
of your requirements.

07:05.670 --> 07:07.035
You should know that,
that security office

07:07.040 --> 07:08.416
is particularly efficient.

07:08.420 --> 07:11.321
Except someone's killing people
right under their noses.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.036
Call me old-fashioned,
but that doesn't seem

07:13.040 --> 07:15.031
like efficient security.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.497
I'm running background checks
on all the male residents, too.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.207
Good. And check wider
in New Mexico for similar crimes,

07:20.210 --> 07:21.575
stranglings in occupied dwellings.

07:21.580 --> 07:22.956
Wish you, command me.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.871
I shall call you the moment
I have anything to contribute,

07:24.880 --> 07:27.417
or an overwhelming desire
to speak to my beautiful Derek Morgan,

07:27.420 --> 07:28.535
whichever comes ﬁrst.

07:28.540 --> 07:31.031
-Let me guess who'll win.
-And you'd be right.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.076
I bid you adieu and safe travels,mon ami.

07:34.920 --> 07:38.208
They called from downstairs.
Ashley's on her way up.

07:45.710 --> 07:49.874
Have you decided what to tell the team
about who she is?

07:49.880 --> 07:53.202
They're going to need to know.
But as far as how she wants to tell them,

07:53.210 --> 07:55.451
I thought we might play that by ear.

07:55.460 --> 07:56.950
I assume since she goes by Seaver

07:56.960 --> 07:58.496
that she doesn't want people
knowing who she is.

08:00.710 --> 08:02.325
There she is.

08:02.330 --> 08:04.662
Kind of makes you feel old, doesn't it?

08:04.670 --> 08:07.116
-No.
-Me, neither.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.069
Ashley.

08:12.170 --> 08:13.614
Agent Trainee Seaver,

08:13.620 --> 08:16.953
Supervisory Special Agents
Prentiss and Morgan.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.076
I've heard a lot about both of you.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.038
-Well, I hope it was all good.
-Very, sir.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.417
Anything specific?
I mean, about me in particular.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.160
Oh, please, don't encourage him.

08:26.170 --> 08:28.240
Agent Seaver is on loan to us
from the Academy

08:28.250 --> 08:30.241
while she's in remedial training
with an injury.

08:30.790 --> 08:33.281
Concussion. Hand-to-hand
got a little out of control.

08:33.290 --> 08:35.201
-How's the other guy?
-Don't ask.

08:35.790 --> 08:37.667
I was remediated in the Academy also.

08:37.670 --> 08:39.319
Agent Seaver, Dr. Reid.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.952
-Um, what was your issue

08:42.960 --> 08:46.498
Marksmanship, physical training,
obstacle course, Hogan's Alley,

08:46.500 --> 08:49.321
you know, pretty much everything
that wasn't technically book related.

08:49.330 --> 08:51.616
They ultimately had to make exceptions
to allow me into the field.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.781
Agent Seaver's going
to accompany us to New Mexico.

08:54.790 --> 08:56.451
-She is?
-As a consultant.

08:56.460 --> 08:59.202
-On?
-She has a unique perspective.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.530
-They don't know?
-Well, we weren't sure

09:02.540 --> 09:04.496
how you wanted to, um...

09:04.500 --> 09:08.493
Seaver's not my original last name.
It's my mother's maiden name.

09:08.830 --> 09:10.786
Mine used to be Beauchamp.

09:10.790 --> 09:12.371
My father is Charles Beauchamp.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.827
As in the Redmond Ripper
Charles Beauchamp?

09:16.790 --> 09:17.996
That's him.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.958
He killed 25 women over 10 years
in rural North Dakota.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.030
I think that you caught him,
right, Rossi?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.201
Hotch was on that team, too.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.701
Based on her life experience,
we were hoping that Agent Seaver

09:28.710 --> 09:30.996
might recognize something
in the family dynamics

09:31.000 --> 09:33.992
inside the community
that could be helpful.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.991
We have a plane waiting.

09:42.330 --> 09:44.537
Her father was a serial killer?

09:44.540 --> 09:46.371
That's definitely
a different set of parameters.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.610
I don't want her presence
to get us sidetracked.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.872
It's a long shot that
she's gonna see anything helpful.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.826
-We work it like any other case.
-You got it.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.821
LAS CRUCES, NEW MEXICO

09:59.830 --> 10:01.161
ID, please.

10:01.170 --> 10:02.956
Agent Hotchner, FBI.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.412
Harvey Brinkman,
Chief of Security for the development.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.035
Nice to meet you.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.577
Detective Ruiz is in the model home.

10:11.330 --> 10:13.912
-Park on the right.
-Thanks very much.

10:17.670 --> 10:20.036
Well, the fact of the matter is,
"Beam me up, Scotty,"

10:20.040 --> 10:21.200
was never actually said.

10:21.210 --> 10:22.996
The closest they ever got was
"Scotty, beam us up"

10:23.000 --> 10:25.321
in "The Gamesters of Triskelion"
and "The Savage Curtain" episode,

10:25.330 --> 10:27.912
-but interestingly enough...
-Reid. Reid, come on. Give it a rest.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.036
-Detective Ruiz?
-That's right.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.450
-I'm Agent Hotchner.
-Call me Felix.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.280
These are Agents Morgan and Prentiss,

10:33.290 --> 10:35.417
Dr. Reid, Agent Rossi,
and Agent Seaver.

10:35.420 --> 10:36.660
Thanks for coming.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.206
As your tech requested,
we moved everything

10:38.210 --> 10:39.700
from the station right here
into the model home.

10:39.710 --> 10:41.029
Thank you.
-Agent Prentiss and I would

10:41.040 --> 10:43.247
love to take a look around,
get a feel for the area.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.821
We'd like to see the latest
crime scene, too, if that's possible.

10:45.830 --> 10:47.377
_ Of course. _
Let me just get everybody Situated

10:47.380 --> 10:48.916
-and I'll walk you over there.
-Oh, we can find it.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.912
-You sure?
-Yeah. It's no problem.

10:55.170 --> 10:58.162
They sure aren't the "mind your own
business" types, are they?

10:58.170 --> 11:01.071
So how come none of them
have seen our UnSub?

11:04.620 --> 11:06.531
These are the evidence boards.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.576
As you can see,
we're still in the process of moving in.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.411
I didn't think the whole neighborhood
needed to see the photos.

11:12.420 --> 11:15.036
No, you're right.
It's a lot of work, Detective. Thank you.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.076
Color-coded and annotated.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.741
Yeah, well, I'm not just
the primary detective.

11:20.420 --> 11:23.036
-I also live in the community.
-Rea|ly?

11:23.830 --> 11:25.912
Three blocks right up on the left.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.286
My wife thought it would be
an excellent place to raise the kids.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.497
She's changed her opinion
in the last couple of months.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.241
Yeah, I guess so.
-You okay?

11:34.790 --> 11:36.701
Yeah. Let's get to work.

11:36.710 --> 11:40.532
I hope you don't mind,
but I also worked up a cursory profile.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.708
-You did?
-Yeah. I took an FBI seminar

11:43.710 --> 11:46.326
on serial crime in Albuquerque. Twice.

11:46.750 --> 11:49.071
Let's hear what you've got so far.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.287
All right. He's organized.

11:51.290 --> 11:53.576
He took everything to the scene,
he left nothing behind,

11:53.580 --> 11:56.663
which means he lives with a spouse
or some kind of long-term partner.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.490
Has a steady, skilled job.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.456
Physically, he presents himself
as non-threatening,

12:00.460 --> 12:02.530
but he craves power and control,

12:02.540 --> 12:05.282
so he may have a job or an activity
that gives him that.

12:06.250 --> 12:09.458
-Not bad.
- Unfortunately, I just described

12:09.460 --> 12:11.997
64 of the 71 men
who live in the subdivision.

12:32.420 --> 12:34.320
And that
is the whole kit and caboodle

12:34.330 --> 12:35.991
on each of your 64 suspects.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.161
Nothing really stands out.
They're all pretty plain.

12:38.170 --> 12:40.570
That's pretty much the main issue
we're going to have here.

12:40.580 --> 12:42.992
Yeah. Vanilla doesn't make
your job any eaSIer.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.117
-No, it does not.-So, um, how's it going

12:46.120 --> 12:49.328
with the agent whose father was a...

12:50.120 --> 12:52.281
-You know

12:52.290 --> 12:55.282
I might have looked into
someone's hidden background.

12:55.290 --> 12:57.281
What? I am not gonna
let some strange new person

12:57.290 --> 12:59.167
travel with my family
and not find out who they are.

12:59.170 --> 13:00.285
Well, she seems fine.

13:01.710 --> 13:03.871
-What is that in your voice

13:03.880 --> 13:05.529
Oh, my God, you think she's pretty.

13:05.540 --> 13:08.953
-What? I never said that.
-You totally do.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.246
- P.G. out,_lover boy.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.911
-What's all that?
-Our technical analyst

13:17.920 --> 13:20.206
ran background checks
on the suspects.

13:20.210 --> 13:21.370
Oh, I could have given you that.

13:21.380 --> 13:23.029
We typically gather
our own intelligence.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.612
Our federal databases tend
to have more detailed information.

13:26.620 --> 13:27.780
Well, how do you know
they're more detailed

13:27.790 --> 13:29.530
if you haven't seen ours?

13:29.920 --> 13:33.162
-It's nothing personal, Chief.
-It's just, you could have asked.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.207
Next time I will.

13:42.250 --> 13:45.037
-Has anyone vetted them?
-Garcia's doing a separate check

13:45.040 --> 13:47.247
on police and security staff.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.569
Why?

13:49.250 --> 13:50.990
Law enforcement and security

13:51.000 --> 13:53.742
are the kind of jobs
that would attract this UnSub.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.207
Dennis Rader, BTK,
was a compliance officer

13:56.210 --> 13:57.575
in Park City, Kansas. Kenneth Bianchi,

13:57.580 --> 13:59.662
one of the Hillside Stranglers,
worked as a security guard

13:59.670 --> 14:00.955
in California and Washington.

14:01.210 --> 14:04.828
Psychopaths love official jobs
and uniforms.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.746
Where were you
on the night of the 12th?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.956
Are you saying you think this was me?

14:11.960 --> 14:14.702
-Answer the question!
-Are you kidding me?

14:14.710 --> 14:16.780
You interviewed every adult male
in the community?

14:16.790 --> 14:18.917
More than once. They're all digitized.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.320
Were all the interviews
confrontational like this?

14:23.040 --> 14:24.450
Is that wrong?

14:24.460 --> 14:27.327
You didn't get much out of them,
did you?

14:27.330 --> 14:28.376
No.

14:29.210 --> 14:31.110
That's when I started thinking
maybe I needed some help.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.530
They don't have anything?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.496
HOME OF AUBREY & DREW JACOBS

14:35.500 --> 14:37.661
What... After the second woman was killed,
Detective Ruiz said they had evidence.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.706
The police are doing
everything they can.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.109
And now you're telling me
you have nothing?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.418
I don't understand how something
like this could happen

14:49.420 --> 14:51.786
and no one heard or saw anything.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.458
It's because the kind
of person who does this

14:55.960 --> 14:58.201
spends their life practicing.

14:59.290 --> 15:02.077
And what they're good at
is getting away with it.

15:03.830 --> 15:07.209
Yeah, well, Aubrey never
hurt anybody in her whole life.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.609
I wish I had answers for you.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.667
It's my daughter.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.957
I gotta get her out of here.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.570
Everywhere she looks...

15:24.580 --> 15:27.617
-Where_ is she now?
-She's in her room.

15:28.380 --> 15:31.372
-Do you need to talk to her?
-No. That's all right.

15:31.380 --> 15:34.611
Sir, the UnSub
came through the garage?

15:34.620 --> 15:37.783
Yeah. Detective Ruiz said
the remote openers

15:37.790 --> 15:40.418
in this compound only
have five unique codes.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.877
Well, you'd think they would
tell you that when you moved in, right?

15:42.880 --> 15:46.281
Anyone could just drive around
and open up a fifth of the garage doors.

15:47.540 --> 15:50.828
I usually make sure
all the inside doors are locked up,

15:51.500 --> 15:53.821
but Aubrey stayed up late and...

15:56.710 --> 15:58.701
We're very sorry for your loss.

15:58.710 --> 15:59.870
Daddy?

16:02.120 --> 16:04.782
It's my daughter. Can I...

16:05.250 --> 16:06.786
Yes, of course.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.074
Thanks.

16:13.540 --> 16:17.579
All that stuff you said about BTK
and the Hillside Strangler,

16:17.580 --> 16:19.241
it's all in your head?

16:19.250 --> 16:21.286
I have an eidetic memory.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.246
So you know everything
my dad did, then?

16:25.250 --> 16:28.287
I only know what I was told
and what was in the papers.

16:29.290 --> 16:32.418
-I don't have a lot of details.
-What sort of details?

16:32.420 --> 16:33.785
Agent Seaver.

16:33.790 --> 16:35.781
There's going to be
a community meeting tonight.

16:35.790 --> 16:38.418
We're going to all look for visual cues,
but I want you specifically

16:38.420 --> 16:40.615
-to concentrate on family interactions.
-Yes, sir.

16:40.620 --> 16:44.078
Chief, we need to have a place
to hold a town meeting.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.872
Well, there's a church
on the east side of the development.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.165
Will you have your men notify residents

16:48.170 --> 16:49.910
that there'll be a meeting there tonight?

16:49.920 --> 16:52.377
Stress that it's important,
but not compulsory.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.911
-We can do that.
-Thank you.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.911
00 pm.
-RUIZ: Agent Hotchner.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.876
-Sir?
-You should see this.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.825
This guy's Frank Morris.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.781
Ido

17:04.790 --> 17:06.997
I run the damn Neighborhood Watch.

17:07.380 --> 17:10.110
That means you're
walking around at night.

17:10.120 --> 17:11.610
Now, the profile could
include somebody

17:11.620 --> 17:12.746
in the Neighborhood Watch, right?

17:12.750 --> 17:15.071
It could. We'd have to know
more about his activities.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.662
-Exactly. I'll have him brought in.
-We're going to try something else.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.956
Can you make some officers available
to run a sign-in table

17:19.960 --> 17:21.609
at a community meeting tonight?

17:21.620 --> 17:23.247
One of the things
we're going to be examining

17:23.250 --> 17:25.457
is body language
in a group environment.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.280
-Bodylanguage?
-It's something that the UnSub

17:27.290 --> 17:29.918
won't be able to control,
even if he were to try to.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.160
Right. Right.

17:31.170 --> 17:32.785
I'll have some uniforms
detailed to the meeting.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.166
Will you also tell Brinkman
that the UnSub

17:34.170 --> 17:36.320
will display something
that he can't control?

17:36.330 --> 17:37.456
Okay.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.076
You think they'll be able
to keep that to themselves?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.825
Let's hope not.

17:43.210 --> 17:45.917
Looks like she was writing
a story or something.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.115
Yeah, her husband said
she was taking classes.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.452
She wanted to be a novelist.

17:50.460 --> 17:54.078
I want to get this over to Garcia
so she can do her thing.

17:54.830 --> 17:55.990
Man, this job.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.663
What we see. All these lives cut short.

18:00.670 --> 18:02.285
I know, Prentiss.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.326
I was just thinking about you.

18:05.330 --> 18:06.786
Baby girl, listen. We got a laptop here

18:06.790 --> 18:08.246
that was owned by the last victim.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.324
I'm gonna hook it up for you
over at the model home

18:10.330 --> 18:11.661
so you can work your magic, all right?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.706
-What kind of magic?-Well, she was a writer,

18:13.710 --> 18:14.995
so maybe she kept a journal?

18:15.330 --> 18:17.378
Maybe she noticed
somebody following her

18:17.380 --> 18:18.824
or just felt something weird,
I don't know.

18:18.830 --> 18:22.038
-So, fishing.
-Yep. Fish away.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.878
Okay. I just so happen to have
a pair of chartreuse waders

18:24.880 --> 18:26.416
-I never get to wear.-Oh, and, Garcia,

18:26.830 --> 18:27.990
of the suspects who are left,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.956
see if any of them
have a tech background,

18:29.960 --> 18:31.325
enough that they would know
how to modify

18:31.330 --> 18:33.378
a remote garage door opener.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.529
Done, love you, ciao.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.416
Modify a remote?

18:36.420 --> 18:38.115
Marjorie West's family was out of town.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.747
Jill Long was strangled
in her laundry room

18:39.750 --> 18:41.377
while her family was camping outside.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.206
And right here, the UnSub's
able to get through the entire house

18:44.210 --> 18:46.747
only to find a room
where somebody was awake?

18:46.750 --> 18:48.991
Does that sound like somebody
just randomly checking garage doors

18:49.000 --> 18:50.820
-to see if the fifth one will open?

18:50.830 --> 18:53.788
No. That sounds like someone
who can open the garage

18:53.790 --> 18:55.246
he specifically needs opened.

18:55.580 --> 18:56.877
Prentiss.

18:57.710 --> 19:00.281
We'll be right there.
Rossi wants us at the church.

19:00.290 --> 19:02.667
They're setting up a community meeting.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.416
Let's go.

19:07.330 --> 19:09.378
We just came from
the last victim's house.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.200
The UnSub used the garage as access.

19:11.210 --> 19:13.610
Maybe a remote door opener
made to be universal.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.076
The police are saying it's random,

19:15.080 --> 19:17.878
but how could you randomly find
a woman so vulnerable?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.666
Garcia's going over backgrounds again,

19:19.670 --> 19:22.286
trying to highlight anyone
with tech experience.

19:22.290 --> 19:25.077
She's also doing a full workup
on Brinkman and Ruiz.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.071
They had that kind of access.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.571
-Has anyone seen Ruiz?
-I saw him a while ago.

19:29.580 --> 19:31.992
He set up everyone filling out forms,
but I haven't seen him since.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.740
We need to ask for help
in a different way.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.280
Tell people that
we're looking for someone

19:35.290 --> 19:36.416
who might have seen something

19:36.420 --> 19:38.536
rather than someone
who did something.

19:38.540 --> 19:41.247
No one thinks that their friends
or neighbors are capable of this.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.569
We should get started.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.160
We're hoping that someone
may have seen something

20:14.170 --> 20:15.285
and not even realized it.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.611
Maybe you have a neighbor
who takes his trash out late,

20:19.120 --> 20:20.667
works on his car in his garage,

20:20.670 --> 20:24.458
anything that might put someone
outside at an odd hour

20:25.290 --> 20:27.781
and given them the opportunity
to see something.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.878
Is there anything
we can help you look for?

20:30.880 --> 20:32.529
It won't be overt.

20:32.830 --> 20:35.037
The kids probably
won't be afraid of dad.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.376
They won't?
These guys have explosive tempers,

20:37.380 --> 20:38.995
-don't they?
-Definitely.

20:46.170 --> 20:47.876
Anger wasn't
normal in my house.

20:48.460 --> 20:51.327
Usually when it happened,
when it exploded,

20:51.330 --> 20:53.491
it was an anomaly. A surprise.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.031
If anything,
my father was overly solicitous.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.700
Too nice.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.990
And if I wanted anything,

21:12.380 --> 21:14.075
bicycles, toys, dolls,

21:16.040 --> 21:18.031
all I had to do was ask.

21:24.670 --> 21:27.070
In groups, he always held my hand.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.529
Always.

21:29.540 --> 21:32.577
Sometimes so tight,
it almost cut off the circulation.

21:33.540 --> 21:37.533
But I can never remember him
putting me on his lap,

21:39.250 --> 21:41.115
holding me in any way.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.162
-Ashley?
-And

21:57.710 --> 22:00.281
he'd always have these talks with me.

22:00.830 --> 22:03.458
He was terrified
someone would take me.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.746
Because he knew what was out there.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.614
Yeah, men like him.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.786
You know, maybe this man

22:16.790 --> 22:19.111
recently bought gifts for his kids.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.872
My dad used to buy me
things all the time.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.075
-What kinds of gifts?
-Anything.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.378
Everything. I told you,
there was nothing...

22:32.580 --> 22:34.070
My whole life,

22:34.420 --> 22:37.787
there's only one thing I wanted
that I couldn't have.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.611
-Which was?
-A pet.

22:55.830 --> 22:56.956
What have we got?

22:56.960 --> 22:58.951
We're gonna start with
the people who didn't show.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.780
Cross-reference with families
With no pets.

23:01.460 --> 23:02.996
-No pets?
-I remembered I wasn't

23:03.000 --> 23:05.787
allowed to have a dog
or a pet of any kind.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.036
It was more than a rule.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.611
-It was a big problem for us.
-That could be something.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.872
I'm sorry I couldn't point him out.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.108
We don't expect you to point him out.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.452
We're hoping you can help us
once we have things narrowed down.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.327
Guys, of the 64 suspects,
18 of them didn't show up.

23:21.330 --> 23:24.072
Okay, Prentiss, take Ashley
back to the model home,

23:24.080 --> 23:26.492
go through the 18 names
and add the pet information.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.660
I got it.

23:27.670 --> 23:29.456
Garcia's working on
technical backgrounds?

23:29.460 --> 23:31.701
-Yes.
-Okay, let's get her the 18 names.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.575
And Ruiz never got here?

23:33.580 --> 23:35.320
No. Neither did the security chief.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.537
Okay, as far as I'm concerned,
we have 20 no-shows.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.492
That was good stuff back there,
what you said.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.030
-That was helpful.
-Was it?

23:45.040 --> 23:46.166
Yeah.

23:47.830 --> 23:49.707
Profiling is a process.

23:50.170 --> 23:51.876
It's about puzzle pieces,

23:51.880 --> 23:55.168
things that don't look like they fit
until they do.

23:56.750 --> 23:59.537
I still don't know how anything
I said will be helpful.

24:00.330 --> 24:04.369
Well, you never know.
If we have a subject in interrogation,

24:04.380 --> 24:06.371
knowing that he's a father

24:06.380 --> 24:08.701
who's a serial killer,
he might be overprotective.

24:08.710 --> 24:11.167
That could be the perfect way
to get him to talk.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.741
The truth is, I...

24:14.710 --> 24:18.202
I never actually thought about them
being fathers at all.

24:19.420 --> 24:21.456
I don't think anyone does.

24:24.580 --> 24:26.878
Is he still alive, your father?

24:28.330 --> 24:30.958
North Dakota does not
have the death penalty.

24:32.710 --> 24:35.873
And the answer_
to your next question is no,

24:35.880 --> 24:37.745
I have never been to see him.

24:37.750 --> 24:40.241
He writes from time to time, but...

24:41.540 --> 24:42.916
I haven't opened any of the letters.

24:44.420 --> 24:46.320
-Do you keep them?
-Yes.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.239
Is that wrong?

24:51.670 --> 24:55.037
I don't think there is any right or wrong
when it comes to that.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.576
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

25:04.540 --> 25:06.371
When you catch them,

25:07.580 --> 25:11.072
do they ever say why

25:14.540 --> 25:16.167
Never a good one.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.114
-Agent Hotchner?
-Yes, sir.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.168
Detective Ruiz would like you
to meet him at Main and Oak.

25:23.170 --> 25:25.286
There's been another murder.

25:27.290 --> 25:30.373
Okay, let's hope
the occupancy listings show pets.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.110
This is the pile of suspects
we need to weed the 18 from.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.168
-What are these?
-Victim information,

25:35.170 --> 25:37.661
the families of the three women
who were killed.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.785
Families?

25:38.790 --> 25:40.997
Yeah, families are
the hardest part about this job.

25:41.420 --> 25:43.877
Drew Jacobs.
We talked to him this afternoon.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.700
His wife Aubrey
was victim number three.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.247
She's never going
to have a mother around.

25:48.710 --> 25:49.745
No.

25:51.210 --> 25:52.609
That was her laptop.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.781
Garcia, our tech,
she ran a remote data sweep of it.

25:54.790 --> 25:56.030
We're gonna have
to take it back to the house.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.496
Meeting over?

25:58.120 --> 26:00.168
Relax. It's just me.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.611
-How'd the meeting go?
-We missed you there.

26:03.620 --> 26:05.997
Well, I thought it would be
a good time for a sweep, you know,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.707
while everyone was busy.
What are you girls looking for?

26:08.710 --> 26:10.666
Whether or not any of
the no-shows have pets.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.491
Pets? Those reports
aren't gonna show that.

26:13.750 --> 26:16.662
-No?
-But I can find out for you.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.412
G_ot all that information
in the security office

26:19.420 --> 26:21.615
at the gate on the south end.

26:22.580 --> 26:25.242
-I'll show you.
-I'll be back.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.990
I know, Mike. I'm sorry.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.207
We're doing everything we can.

26:43.830 --> 26:46.822
The UnSub's killed two nights in a row.
It's a major escalation.

26:46.830 --> 26:49.537
-We need to start over.
-What do you mean?

26:49.540 --> 26:50.825
I think we go back to the beginning.

26:50.830 --> 26:54.243
Local P.D. gave us a list
of 64 out of the 71 possible males.

26:54.250 --> 26:57.538
I think we throw that out
and start with the original 71.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.030
What about Ruiz?

26:59.040 --> 27:00.701
He's definitely on the list.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.610
Pets, pets, pets...

27:09.920 --> 27:11.706
I know they're in here somewhere.

27:11.710 --> 27:13.871
-Maybe I should take a look?
-Relax.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.324
Why you gotta be in such a hurry?

27:16.210 --> 27:19.373
-'Cause we're trying to catch a killer.
-Yeah.

27:19.380 --> 27:20.699
Here it is.

27:22.710 --> 27:23.779
Wait.

27:25.380 --> 27:26.415
Yes?

27:27.750 --> 27:31.117
How hard is the background check
to get into the FBI?

27:31.920 --> 27:34.241
I got arrested once.
It was supposed to be expunged,

27:34.250 --> 27:35.569
but it wasn't.

27:35.580 --> 27:38.242
It was really all just
a big misunderstanding.

27:38.250 --> 27:40.457
Oh, well, you know,
if it was a misunderstanding...

27:41.210 --> 27:42.279
Really?

27:42.960 --> 27:43.995
No.

27:50.330 --> 27:51.911
Hi. Mr. Jacobs?

27:53.670 --> 27:55.285
Go finish getting ready, Heather.
It's okay.

27:56.750 --> 27:59.662
My name is Agent Seaver.
I'm with the FBI.

27:59.670 --> 28:02.207
-Well, there were agents here already.
-I know.

28:02.210 --> 28:03.950
I brought your wife's computer back.

28:10.830 --> 28:13.242
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.954
Sir, the BAU is going
to find the man that hurt your wife.

28:20.290 --> 28:22.952
And when they do, you'll probably
learn that he has a family.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.827
-I'm sorry?
-A lot of craziness

28:27.250 --> 28:28.615
is gonna go on all at once,

28:28.620 --> 28:30.952
and the family won't be able to tell you.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.418
They'll be afraid.
They won't know how to approach you.

28:35.420 --> 28:36.910
But they'll be very sorry.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.167
They'll wish they could have
done something to stop him.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.497
They would do anything
for things to be different.

28:49.330 --> 28:51.787
I just want to apologize for them.

29:00.420 --> 29:03.321
-Would you like to come in?
-No, I should get back.

29:03.330 --> 29:04.877
It would just be for a minute.

29:04.880 --> 29:07.781
Heather, my daughter, she's afraid.

29:08.380 --> 29:11.497
It might make her feel better
knowing there's an FBI agent here.

29:12.670 --> 29:14.285
Okay. Just for a minute.

29:28.670 --> 29:29.819
Reid, where's the list of people

29:29.830 --> 29:31.912
-that didn't make the meeting?
-Right here.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.911
We need to look at all 71 files.

29:33.920 --> 29:37.117
We need to eliminate suspects our way,
not theirs.

29:37.380 --> 29:40.201
-Garcia, I got you?
-Fingers at the ready.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.701
What's up?
-There are only 67 files here.

29:42.710 --> 29:44.746
Where are the other four?

29:44.750 --> 29:46.069
Well, one of them is me.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.877
And the other three are
the victims' husbands.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.201
Why would
they automatically be cleared?

29:50.210 --> 29:52.075
Wouldn't they?
I mean, if you're gonna check them,

29:52.080 --> 29:54.617
-you might as well check me.
-We are.

29:54.620 --> 29:58.033
-Detective, where are the missing files?
-Uh, right over here.

29:58.040 --> 30:00.918
Garcia, we need you
to run a few more names.

30:01.710 --> 30:02.995
Phillip Long.

30:03.580 --> 30:06.242
Long has no suspicions
on his record, no arrests,

30:06.250 --> 30:07.660
and no technology either.

30:07.670 --> 30:08.819
Drew Jacobs.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.872
This is a really beautiful room.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.617
-I don't want to move again.
-I know.

30:19.580 --> 30:21.320
But I also know that your father

30:21.330 --> 30:23.571
is doing what he thinks is best for you.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.616
-Are you gonna shoot him

30:26.620 --> 30:29.327
The guy who hurt my mom...
Do you have a gun?

30:29.710 --> 30:31.780
-Heather...
-No, it's okay.

30:31.790 --> 30:34.076
-I'm sorry.
-It's not a problem.

30:34.420 --> 30:35.910
-Rea|ly.
-Here.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.071
Thank you,
but I really should be getting back.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.571
-Can I ask you something?
-Of course.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.662
How do you know
what the killer's family is thinking?

30:45.080 --> 30:47.571
You said they'll want to apologize?

30:48.080 --> 30:49.411
They will.

30:50.500 --> 30:55.073
They'll be embarrassed and ashamed...

30:57.330 --> 30:58.820
And really sorry.

30:59.710 --> 31:01.166
But how do you know that?

31:04.000 --> 31:07.663
Drew Jacobs has a couple of arrests
for assault when he was younger.

31:07.670 --> 31:09.456
I'll get you more details on that
in a sec.

31:10.460 --> 31:12.746
Is this the husband of the woman
whose computer I went through?

31:12.750 --> 31:15.116
-Yeah.-She was really unhappy with him.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.452
She said he was distant,
he left her alone at night...

31:17.460 --> 31:19.416
Yeah, wandering around outside.

31:19.420 --> 31:20.535
Outside?

31:20.540 --> 31:21.950
As a matter of fact,
before his wife was killed,

31:21.960 --> 31:23.370
he was my top suspect.

31:23.380 --> 31:24.415
How do you

31:26.040 --> 31:30.374
know how the killer's family will feel?

31:32.620 --> 31:34.781
We study it in the FBI.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.285
Behavior.

31:38.420 --> 31:40.490
We've conducted interviews.

31:41.830 --> 31:43.616
Of killers' families?

31:44.710 --> 31:47.998
-Sometimes.
-Why would you do that?

31:51.960 --> 31:55.111
Wait, wait. He's an IT expert
who travels around the world.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.378
He's a tech. All right, thanks, baby girl.

31:58.380 --> 32:00.530
-What's going on?
-There was another murder.

32:00.540 --> 32:02.110
_ -What? _
-During the meeting.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.667
Where's Seaver?

32:04.170 --> 32:06.616
I, uh... I really need to be
getting back out there.

32:06.620 --> 32:07.951
I know, I know. It's just...

32:08.960 --> 32:11.667
This is important to me.
How do you know?

32:14.330 --> 32:16.821
How do you know
what his family will think?

32:17.830 --> 32:19.206
- -Uh...

32:20.500 --> 32:22.536
-I have to get that. Yes, I...
-No.No!

32:22.540 --> 32:24.496
I have to, it's my team.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.452
-Agent Seaver.
-Ashley, where are you?

32:29.830 --> 32:32.412
-Without a doubt, sir.
-Where are you?

32:34.330 --> 32:36.878
-Yes, sir.-Can you get out of there?

32:38.960 --> 32:40.075
Ashley.

32:41.540 --> 32:44.532
I'm sorry, sir. I can't do that.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.821
Mr. Jacobs told me that
his daughter was frightened,

32:48.830 --> 32:53.324
and as soon as I can make
her feel better, I'll come back.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.076
Jacobs has her.
She has no gun. Let's go.

32:57.080 --> 32:58.616
Son of a bitch!

32:59.460 --> 33:01.280
That was my boss. He's kind of a pain.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.996
Hmm. What did he want?

33:06.920 --> 33:08.410
He's always checking up on me.

33:12.750 --> 33:15.708
-Daddy, no!
-Look, Mr. Jacobs, wait. No...

33:15.710 --> 33:18.577
-Shut up!
-Okay. Please...

33:19.960 --> 33:21.075
Please, don't make her watch.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.745
-What?
-Your daughter.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.491
You never let her see you angry, right?

33:28.670 --> 33:30.456
Please, don't let her see this.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.243
She will never forget it, Mr. Jacobs.

33:37.420 --> 33:39.285
If you let her see this,

33:40.330 --> 33:42.616
she will never forgive you.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.781
Heather, go downstairs.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.872
-I don't want to.
-It's time to go, Heather.

34:06.790 --> 34:08.496
You don't have to do this, Mr. Jacobs.

34:08.750 --> 34:11.162
I'm gonna ask you one more time,

34:11.920 --> 34:15.287
how do you know
what the families will think?

34:18.120 --> 34:19.997
My father was like you.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.877
-What?
-He killed a lot of women

34:23.880 --> 34:25.450
before I was a teenager.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.490
His name was Charles Beauchamp

34:28.500 --> 34:30.206
and they called him
the Redmond Ripper.

34:30.830 --> 34:33.742
-Your father?
-He was like you.

34:36.460 --> 34:37.950
He was a serial killer.

34:41.420 --> 34:44.162
Daddy? Daddy, please.

34:44.460 --> 34:46.451
I know how tired you are.

34:47.580 --> 34:50.071
I know how exhausting your life is.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.785
I watched him live it.

34:54.580 --> 34:56.491
I watched him fight it,

34:56.500 --> 34:59.412
and I saw how desperately
he wanted to be different.

35:05.750 --> 35:07.490
Prentiss and Morgan, take the back.
Make noise.

35:07.500 --> 35:10.788
Let him know he's caught.
It may be the only chance she's got.

35:11.380 --> 35:14.372
I watched him try so hard
to be a good father.

35:15.290 --> 35:18.874
But in the end,
he just couldn't stop the other thing.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.660
-FBI|
-FBI!

35:23.670 --> 35:26.161
Daddy, please, let's just leave!

35:26.170 --> 35:27.740
Go downstairs, Heather.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.320
Please, Daddy.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.160
FBI!

35:32.170 --> 35:33.205
FBI!

35:35.290 --> 35:37.281
My father once told me

35:41.960 --> 35:44.201
because he could finally stop.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.456
Do you hate him?

35:53.290 --> 35:55.611
Daddy!

35:56.580 --> 35:58.286
Daddy!

35:58.290 --> 36:01.077
I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.

38:16.380 --> 38:19.281
You were not supposed
to go off on your own.

38:19.620 --> 38:20.700
I know.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.037
-You could have been killed.
-I know that, too.

38:25.380 --> 38:27.701
Why, Ashley? You're smarter than that.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.032
I never got to apologize
to any of the victims.

38:35.330 --> 38:38.163
The families of the women
my father killed.

38:39.420 --> 38:42.287
I thought if I could just apologize
to one family

38:42.290 --> 38:44.531
that had been hurt that way...

38:47.000 --> 38:48.319
I'm sorry, that's not good enough.

38:51.540 --> 38:54.111
By making that choice,
you put everyone at risk.

38:55.170 --> 38:56.910
When you're in the field,
we are responsible

38:56.920 --> 38:59.411
to and for each other. We are a team.

39:02.170 --> 39:03.535
I won't do it again.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.700
No, you won't.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.911
What else is on your mind?

39:17.670 --> 39:18.819
A dog.

39:24.670 --> 39:26.570
When I was seven years old,
I found a puppy

39:26.580 --> 39:28.662
on my way home from school.

39:30.710 --> 39:33.611
I ran all the way home
with this little ball of fur.

39:33.620 --> 39:34.951
I was so excited.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.618
And when I got to the house,
my dad was the only one home.

39:42.120 --> 39:45.829
And I gave him the puppy to hold
while I got him some milk.

39:47.210 --> 39:49.496
We didn't have dog food,
but I thought, well,

39:49.500 --> 39:52.116
a puppy's like a baby, so milk, right?

39:54.170 --> 39:56.035
And when I got back,

39:56.710 --> 39:58.951
my dad was in the bathroom,

40:00.420 --> 40:03.492
and he turned and told me
to put the milk away.

40:05.210 --> 40:06.996
I didn't understand.

40:08.290 --> 40:10.952
And he told me we didn't need
the hassle of another mouth to feed,

40:10.960 --> 40:13.326
and I was never to do that again.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.707
And he tilted his head,

40:18.750 --> 40:22.914
and I started crying, and I could swear
he looked like he was having fun.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.661
He's a psychopath.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.748
Cruelty to animals is part of that.

40:28.750 --> 40:29.956
I know.

40:32.670 --> 40:34.911
But what I don't understand...

40:36.580 --> 40:40.038
Mr. Jacobs asked me a question
about my father, and...

40:41.290 --> 40:42.917
I don't hate him.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.206
I don't.

40:46.210 --> 40:48.166
I try, but I just don't.

40:50.210 --> 40:52.201
No matter what else he is,

40:53.710 --> 40:55.325
he's your father.

40:56.750 --> 41:00.322
Now, you're not responsible
for the things he did.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.872
But you can't change
the fact that to you,

41:08.210 --> 41:09.950
he's still your dad.

41:13.670 --> 41:17.709
I just feel like he's winning
ifI don't hate him.

41:18.210 --> 41:19.609
No, kiddo.

41:20.750 --> 41:22.536
There's no winning.

41:24.290 --> 41:26.576
There's just living.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.667
Moving forward.

41:31.420 --> 41:33.615
And if you keep doing that,

41:36.080 --> 41:37.160
you'll be all right.

41:40.580 --> 41:41.911
Is that true?

41:45.120 --> 41:46.530
It is for me.

41:51.330 --> 41:52.410
Thank you.
