A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:08.508 --> 00:09.968
BRIDGETON MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:10.051 --> 00:12.387
[Shame]  Whether they know it or not,

00:12.470 --> 00:14.764
people need shame.

00:15.223 --> 00:19.769
It protects them from
the sickening filth infesters within

00:19.978 --> 00:23.148
their humiliating inadequacies,

00:23.231 --> 00:25.900
self-destructive proclivities,

00:25.984 --> 00:28.236
stupid magic tricks,

00:28.570 --> 00:31.406
their fundamental otherness.

00:31.489 --> 00:35.160
And of course,
the uncontrollable urge to squirm,

00:35.243 --> 00:37.537
on a glowed worm.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.831
For you say,

00:39.914 --> 00:44.878
shame is the cone you place around
the head of your dim-witted dog

00:44.961 --> 00:48.173
to protect him
from naughting at his own genitals,

00:48.256 --> 00:51.342
because they will become infected.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.553
But I wanna naught so bad!

00:53.636 --> 00:55.180
Uh, uh, uh!

00:55.263 --> 00:56.222
-Oh.
-There we are.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.099
Oh, thank you.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.351
You're such a good master.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.770
-Bad boy!
-Hit me.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.188
What about my toochie?

01:03.271 --> 01:05.607
-Stop enjoying this!
-But I love it.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.192
[Tyler laughing]

01:38.848 --> 01:41.684
Oh, Wiggles, won't you please wake up?

01:41.768 --> 01:43.520
It's no use, Missy.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.815
You suffocated it with your greedy moans.

01:46.898 --> 01:51.319
-Hey, it's the floating grandpa!
-For the last time, you imbecile.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.321
-I'm the Shame Wizard. Uh!
-[Steve grunts]

01:53.404 --> 01:55.657
-What are you doing?
-Oh, there's the problem.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.700
-Oh, good Lord!
-[chuckles]

01:57.784 --> 01:59.077
LeBron James!

01:59.160 --> 02:00.203
[gasping]

02:00.286 --> 02:01.162
[Steve] Oh, man.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.915
I was going to ask you why your hands
were down your pants

02:03.998 --> 02:07.585
in front of all the children,
but now that seems besides the point.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.046
Pardon my French, but my pubbies

02:10.130 --> 02:13.091
were pulling my balls
into my butthole, so...

02:13.383 --> 02:14.676
Oh, you got one on your cheek.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.177
-Don't... touch me.
-Make a wish.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.596
Oh, then my wish didn't come true.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.142
-Your wish was to touch me?
-Yeah, you're my best friend!

02:22.225 --> 02:24.185
-But we've never met.
-Okay.

02:24.269 --> 02:28.148
-Hi, I'm Steve. I'm your best friend.
-Wait, I'm sorry...

02:28.231 --> 02:30.692
-Isn't Jay your best friend?
-Oh, yeah.

02:30.775 --> 02:34.028
Jay's my best friend
and Miss B's my best friend

02:34.112 --> 02:36.948
-and the Shame Lizard's my best friend.
-Wait.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.701
Do you think my name is Shane Lizard?

02:39.784 --> 02:41.202
Yeah, cool name.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.372
I drew a picture of all of us
in the bedroom.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.125
-You want to go see it, The Shane Lizard?
-[sighs]

02:47.208 --> 02:49.043
I do want to see this picture.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.795
All right! Best friends.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.464
-Hey, Gina.
-What do you want?

02:53.548 --> 02:56.092
I wanted to apologize.
I shouldn't have told anyone

02:56.176 --> 02:57.719
-about what we did.
-Okay.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.221
Even though, you know,
Jessi is the one who spread around

03:00.305 --> 03:02.015
-and it's ultimately her fault
-Nailed it!

03:02.098 --> 03:04.350
-So, are we good now?
-No, we are not good.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.269
But I apologized,
isn't that what you wanted?

03:06.352 --> 03:08.563
No, I wanted you to not tell your friends

03:08.646 --> 03:10.648
that you've squeezed my boob
in the first place.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.234
Unfortunately, Gina.
I think that ship has already sailed.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.777
-Good point!
-Look, we had a fight,

03:14.861 --> 03:16.613
-and I screwed up.
-Keep explaining.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.407
And then I said I was sorry,
so now we're making up

03:19.490 --> 03:21.659
and maybe it's time for
a little make up make out.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.077
Yeah! [kissing]

03:23.161 --> 03:24.245
And then.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.455
And then. [groans]

03:25.538 --> 03:26.915
-You know what you are?
-What?

03:26.998 --> 03:28.708
You're a little fucking prick.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.168
You're a little big boob bitch.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.295
-Get the fuck away from me.
-Wait, I'm sorry.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.172
-I thought we were just flirting.
-No! Argh!

03:34.255 --> 03:36.633
Can't believe I made out with you
in the first place,

03:36.716 --> 03:38.218
-but it won't happen again, so...
-But like--

03:38.301 --> 03:39.552
-Please leave my sleeping area.
-Never say never?

03:39.636 --> 03:40.678
Now!

03:40.762 --> 03:43.014
-Furious.
-Yeah, I see, Caleb.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.307
[Nick grunts]

03:44.390 --> 03:46.226
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.977
Ah, I feel bad about Gina.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.897
Why? She sucks. Everybody sucks.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.566
-Yeah, I gotta get out of here.
-Ooh!

03:53.650 --> 03:57.028
We going on a walkabout?
Let's hope there's no crocs out there!

03:57.111 --> 03:59.489
I really don't think there are
any crocodiles in the hallway.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.032
No, I mean crocs!

04:01.115 --> 04:03.910
Them dumb plastic shoes
with all those holes up in 'em.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.828
I don't wanna smell
your stinky ass kid feet.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.830
Well, it's been a good ride, Wiggles.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.334
From my baby crib to that
socialist Sleepaway Camp.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.337
I'm really gonna miss you, comrade.
Really going to miss you.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.255
-Missy?
-[screams]

04:15.338 --> 04:17.507
Oh, Andrew! What are you doing here?

04:17.590 --> 04:20.468
I just-- I saw you coming out here
and you looked so sad.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.428
-Are you okay?
-I can't even face you.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.346
It's just too much.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.474
-I'm the biggest perv in the world.
-What? That's impossible.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.726
You can't be
the biggest perv in the world.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.978
-Why not?
-Because,

04:30.061 --> 04:31.479
-you're looking at him. Me!
-What?

04:31.562 --> 04:33.273
I am him. I am me.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.942
Me is the biggest perv ever.
This guy, this two thumbs.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.945
I think I understand
what you're trying to do here, Andrew,

04:39.028 --> 04:41.197
and it's very generous,
but I'm a horny spaz

04:41.281 --> 04:43.741
and everyone knows it.
What could be worse than that?

04:43.825 --> 04:46.202
She's a horny spaz.
You should jazz on her.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.121
-Jazz?
-Jizz on her spaz. Jazz.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.206
-The one true American art form.
-Jesus Christ.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.834
Missy, I can't believe
I'm gonna tell you this but,

04:52.917 --> 04:54.794
when we danced together
at the fall dance...

04:54.877 --> 04:56.629
-A Night in Ancient Mesopotamia?
-Well,

04:56.713 --> 04:59.257
when we were dancing,
I kind of came in my pants.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.508
Yikes!

05:00.591 --> 05:02.969
-Oh God, I shouldn't have told you.
-No, Andrew.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.096
It was so brave of you to share with me

05:05.179 --> 05:07.849
and you know what, it actually does
make me feel better.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.684
She's into it! Thrust her.

05:09.767 --> 05:13.438
I feel better too, telling you that
and you not being grossed out

05:13.521 --> 05:16.607
or kicking me in the shins or something,
makes me feel less alone.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.694
I just can't believe
I drove you to climax, that's so adult!

05:20.111 --> 05:21.904
I love it when she talks dork dirty.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.782
If I were to speak from the heart,
it was the most I ever made.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.702
All right. Well, thank you.

05:27.785 --> 05:31.122
And I'm just gonna head back
to the scene of the crime.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.916
[chuckles softly]
Oh, well, Inspector Clouseau.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.669
The most you ever made? Please.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.590
Just for the runoff you blam-o
on my condo floors are warped.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.343
And now my credit score is warped too,

05:43.426 --> 05:46.429
'cause the condo's in my name!
[groans]

05:47.096 --> 05:48.222
-[door opens]
-Jay.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.183
Matthew. Nice pajamas.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.392
Nice jean shorts.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.604
Ha! Joke's on you, idiot.
These are my underwear.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.647
Oh. Jean shorts as underwear,

05:56.773 --> 05:58.358
and he didn't wash his hands.

05:58.608 --> 06:02.070
Oh, and he didn't flush,
and he's reading a magazine called...

06:02.153 --> 06:05.490
Jean Shorts Weekly?
Oh, an interview with Andre Agassi.

06:05.573 --> 06:06.491
Yes, please.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.825
[object clattering]

06:07.909 --> 06:10.119
-Like, hi.
-I have nothing to say to you.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.622
-But, we're like a seam.
-No, we're not.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.625
Oh my God, are you joking me right now?

06:15.708 --> 06:18.961
We both have the best boobs in the grade,
it's so obvious, right?

06:19.045 --> 06:22.131
And we were both like,
wronged by Nick and Andrew.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.300
[sighs]
I guess we did both kind of get used.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.887
We're like total victim sisters
in actuality.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.264
Oh, I don't like to see myself
as a victim.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.683
Okay, so we'll just be sisters.

06:32.767 --> 06:36.479
If mom dies, I get her Bon Jovi earrings.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.730
All right, I see.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.024
-So that one must be Jay.
-[Steve] Ah-ha.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.485
[Shame Wizard]
And why does Miss B have X's for eyes?

06:42.568 --> 06:46.447
She's asleep, 'cause I walloped her
in the head with a telescope.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.449
-That was a wiffle ball bat.
-All right.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.077
And I understand why I'm a lizard.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.955
But why are you drawn so big?

06:54.038 --> 06:56.833
'Cause that's how I feel
when I'm with all my best friends.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.960
None of these people are your friends.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.379
-How come they're in the photo?
-Because you drew them!

07:01.462 --> 07:03.172
-Because they're my best friends.
-You know,

07:03.256 --> 07:07.802
I'm positive there's a treasure trove
of shame somewhere deep inside you,

07:07.885 --> 07:11.472
if I could just drill down
through all the layers of stupidity.

07:11.556 --> 07:16.561
No drills! When I go to the dentist,
I have to be completely knocked out.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.438
'Cause I've been known to bite fingies.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.190
I'm shocked that
you've been to the dentist.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.277
Uh, technically it's a groomer
in the back of a Petco.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.863
You truly are an enigma.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.115
[whispering] You shouldn't say
that word anymore.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.034
[grunts] This things totally blows.
Gina broke up with me.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.911
I'm not sure
you two were really dating per se--

07:33.995 --> 07:35.872
-Thanks for clarifying that.
-Go ahead.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.000
The point is, we're in a gym with girls,
and they're wearing pajamas,

07:39.083 --> 07:41.294
and underneath their pajamas
is their bodies,

07:41.377 --> 07:43.212
and we're wasting this opportunity.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.591
I don't know, maybe we should just
sit here and not chew on our genitals.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.843
Who's suggesting
that we chew on our genitals?

07:48.926 --> 07:50.553
-Nobody.
-What are you wearing, man?

07:50.636 --> 07:52.722
-You look like a lamp.
-It's a special necklace

07:52.805 --> 07:54.932
-to help me be a good boy.
-Argh!

07:55.183 --> 07:56.767
I just wanna hook up with a girl.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.729
Whoa! You can't just hook up with a girl.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.356
First, you gotta be nervous
for like a year and then--

08:02.440 --> 08:04.609
We should be playing
one of those games, you know,

08:04.692 --> 08:07.445
where kids trick each other
into hooking up... [sighs]

08:07.528 --> 08:08.779
Like Spin the Bottle.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.406
Or Shoots and Splatters.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.033
What about Truth or Dare?

08:12.116 --> 08:15.161
I just shared something really
embarrassing with Missy and it felt great.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.412
I don't wanna play this game.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.457
What if someone dares me to like
get naked or streak or something?

08:19.540 --> 08:24.003
'Cause you have a sexy little dicky
and it's just for you.

08:24.086 --> 08:28.007
-How about Smooch or Share?
-What the hell is Smooch or Share?

08:28.090 --> 08:30.343
A fantastic game I just made up.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.387
The rules of Smooch or Share
are very simple.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.057
When it's your turn, you choose
Smooch or Share

08:36.140 --> 08:37.517
and then you spin the bottle.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.853
Nick, did you just invent this game
to kiss girls?

08:40.937 --> 08:44.899
Yeah, I have to assume that's why
you invited the Jansen twins.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.026
Would anybody like
a piece of salty licorice?

08:47.109 --> 08:50.571
Look, guys, I invited the Jansen twins
because they're new to the school,

08:50.655 --> 08:53.199
and yeah, they come from
a more sexually progressive culture.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.118
In the Netherlands, we play this game,
but with Gouda.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.996
-So you spin a wheel of cheese?
-How do you know who it lands on?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.207
Well, we don't, so everybody gets a kiss

09:01.290 --> 09:03.793
and a slice of cheese,
and this is what we call Kindergarten.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.212
Okay. Now I'm interested.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.131
Look, guys.
This game is about getting crazy, y'all.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.884
Crazy, y'all. Yes, yes, y'all.
I should have jumped on that.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.095
-I'll play if Andrew's playing.
-Oh, enchanté.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.137
-I'm in.
-I'm open to it.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.472
Yeah, let's do this.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.725
Okay, folks.
It's time to Smooch or Share,

09:19.809 --> 09:21.602
or Shake Your Booty.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.312
-What's this third option?
-Nothing.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.398
I choose smooch. Gouda, gouda!

09:25.481 --> 09:26.566
-Gouda, gouda!
-Yes, no!

09:26.649 --> 09:28.484
No. no! Me, me! Yes, yes.

09:29.485 --> 09:33.489
No! [crying] Not Missy!

09:33.573 --> 09:36.951
-We wanted one of those Chinese girls.
-You think those girls are Chinese?

09:37.034 --> 09:39.245
Oh God, I'm sorry, are they Korean?

09:39.328 --> 09:41.163
Oh, Missy.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.290
-Is that okay?
-Well, I--

09:42.373 --> 09:44.083
Don't look at him, it's the rules!

09:44.166 --> 09:47.086
And if you don't do it,
we get to burn you with teacher coffee.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.130
Uh... Well, it is the rules.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.590
-Okay.
-I consent.

09:51.507 --> 09:52.341
Muah!

09:52.425 --> 09:55.428
-Wonderful, that was very appropriate.
-You are a gentleman, sir.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.762
I choose share.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.432
Hey, guys, I just want to say
I'm having a blast

09:59.515 --> 10:01.017
and I also wanna make a mental note

10:01.100 --> 10:02.852
to recycle this bottle
once we're finished.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.646
When this sharpie dries out,

10:05.730 --> 10:08.566
we should flush a bunch of golf balls
down the toilet.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.276
[sighs] No.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.821
-What's that picture?
-I was the captain of the debate team.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.281
[Hormone]
What you doing with your face?

10:15.573 --> 10:17.783
-I'm smiling.
-Oh, yeah.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.870
-I miss that.
-I smiled a lot more before you showed up.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.456
Oh! Well, I'm so sorry.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.250
I guess you don't want
the present I got for you now.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.961
-What is it?
-It's a bucket of used golf balls, duh.

10:29.045 --> 10:29.879
Argh!

10:29.962 --> 10:32.715
Honestly, when Nick and I hooked up,
it was fun.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.843
But then it just made me feel like,
so shitty.

10:35.926 --> 10:39.180
Touching boobs and rubbing fronts
doesn't make you feel all shitty.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.140
Mean jerks make you feel shitty,

10:41.223 --> 10:43.309
if there weren't any mean jerks,
it'd be fine.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.686
You know what?
That's kind of a good point.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.482
We should just like feed
all the mean jerks into a wood chipper

10:49.565 --> 10:52.568
and then spread their body chunks
all over the playground

10:52.652 --> 10:54.570
so kids don't get hurt because like,

10:54.654 --> 10:57.615
ultimately we're like
very good samaritans.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.117
Let's just cut off
right before that last part.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.037
Yeah, we'll just put them
in a wood chipper, guys suck.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.330
But what about girls, though?

11:04.413 --> 11:06.957
Devin looked me dead in the eye
and called me a slut.

11:07.041 --> 11:11.629
She let you look her in the eyes?
Oh, my God! Lucky Lola.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.839
Oh, Lola. Devin is so mean to you.

11:13.923 --> 11:14.799
No!

11:14.882 --> 11:17.468
-Why are you even friends with her?
-'Cause like, she said,

11:17.551 --> 11:19.512
like, she's like a beautiful speedboat

11:19.595 --> 11:22.848
and I'm like a lumpy barnacle
that's stuck on her hull.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.267
Oh, Lola.
You don't have to be Devin's Barnacle.

11:25.351 --> 11:29.271
Oh, my God. Are you proposing
that I become like, your barnacle?

11:29.355 --> 11:32.983
-Oh, not exactly--
-'Cause I'll like ruin your paint job,

11:33.067 --> 11:34.944
-but like, ultimately...
-Oh, we're hugging.

11:35.027 --> 11:38.114
...become very good company to you.

11:38.906 --> 11:43.077
Well, Jay, I suppose if I had
to let any magician butt fudge me,

11:43.160 --> 11:46.664
I guess it would be Teller,
because he's small and he seems gentle.

11:46.747 --> 11:51.293
Wrong answer! It's Chris Angel
because his name sounds like anal.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.796
Now, here's how it's done. Smooch.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.881
Come on.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.550
Yes, yes, yes.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.634
No, no, no, no!

11:59.218 --> 12:00.970
-And there it is.
-Shit.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.888
-[laughs] You gotta kiss him.
-Argh!

12:02.972 --> 12:05.933
-[Andrew] But it's the rules.
-Singe his skin with the teacher coffee.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.893
I know how to play Smooch or Share, okay?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.562
But Matthew isn't even playing!

12:09.645 --> 12:11.647
No, I'll play, but there's no way

12:11.731 --> 12:14.066
Jay wants to seem gay by kissing a boy.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.069
No, if I didn't want to kiss you
it'd be because you'd hurt my feelings.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.362
Umm. That's even gayer.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.448
Fuck! Fine, I'll do it.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.532
And when I win this game,

12:21.615 --> 12:24.702
you guys are going to
smooch and share my asshole.

12:24.785 --> 12:29.039
This kid is a goddamn prodigy.
I think he's his own Hormone Monster.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.959
[kissing]

12:32.042 --> 12:34.295
-Well, then.
-In your face, Matthew.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.921
Whoa! Ah-ha!

12:36.005 --> 12:39.258
Jay, Jay. Jay! Am I right?
Here we go. Jay, Jay...

12:40.259 --> 12:41.093
[sighs]

12:41.177 --> 12:43.596
I really should be getting back
to those children,

12:43.679 --> 12:45.765
but I can't leave until
I'm finished with you.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.434
-Why?
-Well, once I begin a task

12:48.517 --> 12:51.395
I feel I must complete it
before I can move on.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.440
-Why?
-It's just this need inside of me.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.567
I crave order, you see.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.029
I suppose that's why mommy
called me Mr. Bookshelf.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.114
-Why?
-I don't know why!

13:02.198 --> 13:05.743
She was the one who told me to organize
the books and I organized them.

13:05.826 --> 13:09.330
And then she made me feel strange
about how I organized.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.831
-Who?
-Mommy!

13:10.915 --> 13:13.918
-Oh, you mean Mrs. Bookshelf.
-No, I mean...

13:14.001 --> 13:16.712
Well, yeah, I suppose so.
Though truth be told,

13:16.796 --> 13:18.339
she never married my father.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.840
-What was he like?
-Father...

13:20.132 --> 13:24.303
He was a tune whistled
by a Cape Town whore.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.722
Oh, yeah. Cape Town,
over by the airport.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.434
-No, South Africa!
-Oh, South Africa...

13:30.643 --> 13:32.061
over by the airport.

13:32.144 --> 13:32.978
[smooching]

13:33.062 --> 13:34.814
All right!

13:34.980 --> 13:36.899
-Danke.
-Kissing with you is like

13:36.982 --> 13:38.067
for me to kiss my uncle.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.278
These girls are hot, but they smell like
herring and dark bread.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.532
Okay, I guess it's my turn
and I pick share.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.325
What? You got to kiss somebody else

13:46.408 --> 13:48.369
to get the dark bread taste
out of your mouth.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.622
-No, let's keep sharing, it feels good.
-A good call in the share.

13:51.705 --> 13:55.167
Ooh! Ask him what's the naughtiest
ickiest thing he's ever done.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.837
All right, buddy. What's the grossest
thing you've ever done?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.338
[chuckles] Oh, wow.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.716
Uh... That's like asking a Beatle
his favorite Beatles song.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.926
Uh, there's so many.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.553
-Okay, this one's good.
-Okay.

14:05.636 --> 14:06.595
-You'll like this.
-Waiting.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.848
-It's gross, but it's good.
-Great, that's the question.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.391
-At your pool house...
-Sure.

14:10.474 --> 14:13.060
Your parents are making lunch,
I go to the bathroom,

14:13.143 --> 14:16.981
I see Leah's bathing suit there, right,
so I get hard

14:17.064 --> 14:18.566
-and I start masturbating to it.
-What?

14:18.649 --> 14:21.068
And then Leah.... Leah walks in on me.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.987
Bah, bah, bah!

14:23.070 --> 14:25.114
So you jerked off to my sister?

14:25.197 --> 14:28.534
Well, to her bathing suit, but yes,
I guess it was... she had been in it.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.618
So I was imagining her.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.330
Ew! We don't want to think of Leah
that way, Andrew's bad.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.958
-The hell, Andrew?
-She's hot. What are we supposed to do?

14:36.041 --> 14:37.459
But you can take it as a compliment.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.670
-What's the compliment?
-You do have the same bone structure.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.338
So it's like you're jerking off to me?

14:41.422 --> 14:43.799
This dirty turtle jerked off
in your house!

14:43.883 --> 14:46.343
-I bet he does it all the time!
-What the fuck are you doing?

14:46.427 --> 14:48.095
Have you masturbated
in my house before?

14:48.178 --> 14:51.849
No, never! When you're in the room...
unless you're sleeping.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.768
Whoa! You jerk off next to him
while he's asleep?

14:54.852 --> 14:56.312
He really is like Uncle Bram.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.939
I wasn't thinking about you, okay? Jerk.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.108
-I was looking at your cat clock.
-My cat clock?

15:01.191 --> 15:03.402
-My grandmother gave me that clock.
-I know.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.322
-Oh, that also turned you on?
-Looking at this in realistic way,

15:06.405 --> 15:07.823
all my thinking was pretty abstract.

15:07.907 --> 15:12.328
-You're like a compulsive masturbator.
-I hate Andrew, I hate his spermy dick.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.747
-He's jealous 'cause he can't jack it.
-Oh, yeah?

15:14.830 --> 15:18.584
Well, Nick, you're just jealous 'cause
you couldn't jerk off if I paid you to.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.878
He wants to pay the boy to masturbate.

15:20.961 --> 15:21.795
[both] Uncle Bram.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.881
[growls]

15:24.757 --> 15:26.634
You're a gigantic jizz creep.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.510
Well, you're a dickless little dwarf.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.637
Guys, stop it.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.598
-I hate you!
-That's convenient, 'cause I hate you too!

15:33.641 --> 15:34.516
I'm outta here.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.061
What kind of hormone monster are you, man?

15:37.144 --> 15:41.148
Making your kid feel bad for jacking off?
That's against the Jizzocratic Oath.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.651
Which you signed in blood and semen.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.487
I remember, it looked like
a cream cheese and jelly sandwich,

15:46.570 --> 15:49.698
and I ate the whole thing.
Yum, yum, yummy.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.700
Great, thanks a lot, now I'm starving.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.119
[Jessi] Where is it? I know it's here.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.746
There! See?

15:55.829 --> 15:59.083
That's who I used to be.
A person interested in social justice,

15:59.166 --> 16:02.127
the kind of female warrior
who empowered other women.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.504
Wait, where are you going?

16:03.587 --> 16:05.089
To be that person again.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.883
That's too vague.
Hold up. You know what?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.718
What I'm gonna do is just follow you.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.638
Oh, shit. My golf balls!

16:12.972 --> 16:13.806
Dammit!

16:14.056 --> 16:15.641
Oh, yeah, I jerked off to your sister.

16:15.724 --> 16:18.185
God, I thought people were gonna
laugh and applaud.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.938
What's wrong with me? Nick and I
are never going to be friends again.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.106
You know what I think?

16:22.189 --> 16:23.315
-Jay.
-What?

16:23.399 --> 16:25.526
I like Jay, he has pubes.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.486
He seems to have sex with everything

16:27.569 --> 16:29.822
and he's got a subscription
to  Jean Shorts Weekly.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.074
-Wait, what?
-Jay is your new best friend.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.868
The fuck? No, no. Nick's my best friend.

16:34.952 --> 16:38.163
-He called you a gigantic jizz creep.
-Well, maybe he's right, maybe I am.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.374
-I mean, look at me.
-Hey, man, you look great.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.084
Women are into soggy guys.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.878
Says so right here in  Soggy Guy Monthly.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.757
-God, that magazine is really--
-Soggy. Yeah, comes in a wet bag.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.094
Andrew's right, I'm a dickless dwarf.

16:52.177 --> 16:55.305
And I only said those terrible things
to him because I feel bad about myself.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.932
-But that's good!
-Excuse me?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.434
You're supposed to feel that way.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.394
-That's what the ghost says.
-The ghost?

17:00.477 --> 17:02.271
The floating guy
with the Harry Potter accent.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.690
Hold on, are you talking about
the Shame Wizard?

17:04.773 --> 17:09.278
Oopsie doopsie. I wasn't supposed to
say anything. [giggling]

17:09.361 --> 17:12.281
No, no, no. This isn't cute or funny.
What did he say to you?

17:12.364 --> 17:13.574
Ga, ga, gu, gu...

17:13.657 --> 17:16.326
Stop it! Have you been working
for the Shame Wizard?

17:16.410 --> 17:19.204
Ah! I'm in cahoots.
Didn't you want me to be in cahoots?

17:19.288 --> 17:22.750
No! No cahoots. The Shame Wizard sucks,
he makes you feel shitty.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.211
You need to feel shitty,
or else you'll do things you'll regret.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.006
The only thing I regret is being mean
to my best friend!

17:29.089 --> 17:32.342
-What about messing things up with Gina?
-Yeah, and that's your fault too.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.054
And what about when I made you
call your dad a pussy?

17:35.137 --> 17:38.348
Yeah, all those things,
you're a shitty Hormone Monster.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.641
Wait, Nick!

17:39.725 --> 17:42.144
I'm not done listing all my failures.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.980
Hey Gina, I just wanted to say I am--

17:45.272 --> 17:46.940
Gina, like, doesn't wanna talk to you.

17:47.024 --> 17:50.944
Yeah, look, I totally understand
why you're upset with me.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.280
It was never my intention
to slut shame you,

17:53.363 --> 17:56.617
but that's not who I am
and I'm really sorry.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.161
Wow, you and Nick are a real pair.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.079
What do you mean?

18:00.162 --> 18:03.457
Your whole friend group. You can't just do
something awful and then say you're sorry,

18:03.540 --> 18:06.502
and then just expect like,
make up make outs.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.379
-What?
-If Gina's gonna make out with anybody

18:09.463 --> 18:10.589
it's going to be me.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.675
So say goodbye to these,
and while you're at it,

18:13.759 --> 18:15.094
say goodbye to these.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.847
They're real and they're basically
two different colors.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.476
-Wait, why?
-I sleep on my side in the tanning bed.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.312
Jessi, I put some golf balls
in this pillowcase.

18:25.395 --> 18:29.316
We're going to turn Lola's organs
into cottage cheese.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.318
Okay, let's all calm down.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.737
I'm just trying to keep
sisterhood alive, you guys.

18:33.821 --> 18:37.741
-Sisterhood? Are you kidding?
-Yeah, you're basically Bill Cosby.

18:37.866 --> 18:41.203
You tell all of us young black men
to pull up our pants

18:41.286 --> 18:43.497
and then you like, rape everybody.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.958
-No, wait--
-You like, snooze everyone down,

18:46.041 --> 18:47.459
and then you like, go to town.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.878
I think Lola is saying
that you're a total hypocrite.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.505
Let's fuck them both up!

18:51.588 --> 18:55.676
No, stop it, they're right.
Even Lola's right.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.386
I am Bill Cosby.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.471
-Oh!
-[sighs]

19:00.639 --> 19:02.307
Goddamn golf balls.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.310
Then everybody at work said
they weren't doing anything.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.062
-Okay.
-But it was clear they were all

19:07.146 --> 19:09.231
-going bowling together.
-Wow.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.775
-And how did that make you feel?
-Abandoned.

19:11.859 --> 19:12.860
-Abandan?
-Sorry?

19:12.943 --> 19:13.777
Abandan?

19:14.236 --> 19:15.988
Are you trying to say "abandoned"?

19:16.071 --> 19:17.281
-Abandan.
-Yes.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.740
-Abandan.
-Yes!

19:18.824 --> 19:21.451
Just like how my father "abandan" me.

19:21.535 --> 19:22.870
-Adandan.
-[crying]

19:22.953 --> 19:24.580
There, I got it, now I got it.

19:25.914 --> 19:26.999
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.668
Um... I just wanted to let you know that

19:29.751 --> 19:31.962
-you're my best friend.
-You're my best friend too.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.006
Now I don't have to be
best friends with Jay.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.799
-Wait, what?
-But Nick, why did we say

19:35.883 --> 19:39.136
-all these terrible things to each other?
-I don't know. I'm sorry.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.888
Tyler is driving me crazy.

19:40.971 --> 19:44.266
No Maury was the driving force behind
the holy a-jerk-off debacle,

19:44.349 --> 19:46.226
I don't even know if I like
doing it standing up.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.853
-Please, no details.
-My butt cramps.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.230
-That sounds hard.
-There's a hard ball in the arch of my--

19:50.314 --> 19:51.648
Just, please, okay?

19:51.732 --> 19:55.235
Tyler is in cahoots with
this floating demon with a scar.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.695
Wait a second. The Shame Wizard?

19:56.778 --> 19:58.322
You know about the Shame Wizard too?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.157
I thought only I could see him!

20:00.240 --> 20:01.992
I thought only I could see him!

20:02.075 --> 20:04.620
We thought we were the only ones
who saw him,

20:04.703 --> 20:07.456
but in the Netherlands
we call him Father Shame.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.917
-Oh, he's the worst.
-Shame Wizard? I've seen him.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.001
I saw him too!

20:11.210 --> 20:12.044
What was that?

20:12.127 --> 20:16.089
Oh, when you were talking,
I spiked a can of soda on the floor.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.509
No, you imbecile! The children!

20:20.010 --> 20:21.845
I'm right behind you, best friend.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.139
[laughs]

20:24.223 --> 20:25.974
There's tiny Epcot Center's on the ground.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.518
What are they doing here? [laughs]
Bye, Roo!

20:28.810 --> 20:31.438
-He comes out of the shadows.
-Yeah, he has like a British accent.

20:31.521 --> 20:34.650
And his face is burned
and he has fingernail knives.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.320
I think that might be Freddy Krueger,
Caleb, but, the rest of us

20:38.403 --> 20:40.530
we're all definitely seeing the same guy.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.783
He told me I was a horny spaz.

20:42.866 --> 20:47.454
He told me I should feel bad about my mom
still wiping me, like yeah, right.

20:47.537 --> 20:52.084
He told me I was a slut, in fact,
all of you told me that I was a slut.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.919
So he was right about at least one thing.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.754
Oh, hi, you want me to
kick your ass again?

20:55.837 --> 20:58.048
-[door slams open]
-[kids screaming]

20:58.131 --> 21:01.093
[Shame Wizard]  I hate you.
Dick in the wall.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.386
You're a slut.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.887
Nickie dickboy.

21:03.971 --> 21:04.805
Filthy perv.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.808
-He's back, oh, God!
- [Shame Wizard]  You're geriatric.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.059
Horny spaz.

21:09.142 --> 21:10.519
Your mother wipes you.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.436
Oh, no!

21:11.520 --> 21:13.355
[Jay] Oh, fuck! No!

21:13.438 --> 21:14.564
Brighton!

21:15.065 --> 21:18.277
Don't listen to him, he's just trying
to make us feel alone and terrible.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.197
That's because you are alone and terrible.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.324
I'm telling you the truth.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.744
Unlike this perverted masturbator.

21:27.828 --> 21:28.787
Oh, big wow.

21:28.870 --> 21:32.416
I already told them about the masturbating
and it was liberating, sir.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.626
So, why don't you just leave us alone?

21:34.710 --> 21:37.546
You truly believe you'd be better off
without me?

21:37.629 --> 21:40.799
-We know we'd be better off without you.
-[gasps]

21:40.882 --> 21:44.511
And now, as my mom says when
I'm not getting in the car fast enough,

21:44.594 --> 21:46.722
"Vamos your caboose, mister."

21:46.805 --> 21:47.889
-Yeah!
-You suck!

21:47.973 --> 21:49.891
Freeze your piss like a popsicle
and eat it!

21:49.975 --> 21:52.311
Yeah! If someone wants to chew
on their genitals

21:52.394 --> 21:55.105
they should be allowed
to make their own mistakes!

21:55.188 --> 21:57.274
See that? Nobody wants you around.

21:57.357 --> 22:02.529
You... You're just a room full of daddies
trying to "adandan" me.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.365
Well, you can't, because I "abandan" you.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.827
-What?
-I "abandan" you!

22:10.120 --> 22:11.163
Um...

22:11.288 --> 22:13.290
-Did he just actually leave?
-I think he did.

22:13.373 --> 22:16.418
That means we're free,
we can do whatever we want.

22:16.501 --> 22:20.714
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to a world without shame, baby.

22:20.797 --> 22:23.050
[Wiggles screams]

22:23.133 --> 22:25.260
Wiggles, you're back!

22:25.344 --> 22:27.346
I missed you so much.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.431
Let's dance, Missy.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.974
-No.
-Oh.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.726
Let's masturbate!

22:32.809 --> 22:34.811
[cheering]

22:35.228 --> 22:36.271
Make it faint, girl.

22:38.231 --> 22:39.566
[moaning]

22:39.649 --> 22:41.151
I'd let you wipe me.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.571
Now people know.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.198
[Tyler imitating bike noises]

22:46.281 --> 22:48.742
Okay, so under here
is coach Steve's office.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.577
Now, this is a great place to jerk off

22:50.660 --> 22:53.038
when coach Steve gets himself stuck
in the volleyball net.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.207
Well, well, well,
what are we up to here, bud?

22:55.290 --> 22:57.584
Hey, just giving a tour
of all the places in the school

22:57.667 --> 22:59.127
where I've totally whacked it.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.755
-You?
-I'm showing up my sweet, little Dicky.

23:01.838 --> 23:05.133
Hi, everybody! I'm Nick's pubic hair.
Y'all have a lovely school.

23:05.217 --> 23:08.637
Nick, you have a small penis,
but your confidence is so appealing.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.640
Thank you, one of the Jansen Twins,
and don't worry, ladies,

23:11.723 --> 23:14.434
someday it'll be totally average.

23:14.518 --> 23:15.977
No shame!

23:16.061 --> 23:18.355
You know, back in the Teachers Lounge,

23:18.438 --> 23:20.065
that was actually my first kiss.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.442
It was my first guy-kiss.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.903
-What did you think?
-Hey, man, a mouth's a mouth.

23:24.986 --> 23:28.448
-Stop quoting your dad's law commercials.
-Why don't you make me?

23:28.532 --> 23:30.534
[both moaning]

23:30.909 --> 23:31.910
Oh, it tickles.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.995
[giggling]

23:35.080 --> 23:37.958
You know what, Devin?
I liked getting my boobs felt,

23:38.041 --> 23:41.294
and if that makes me a slut, well,
then that's your problem.

23:41.378 --> 23:45.006
Lola, quit humping your new boyfriend
and kick her ass for me.

23:45.090 --> 23:49.261
Devin! You like, full on broke my heart.

23:49.344 --> 23:52.681
Bacio della morte,  you fucking bitch.

23:52.764 --> 23:53.932
[kisses]

23:54.015 --> 23:55.058
-Lola.
-Unfriend.

23:55.142 --> 23:55.976
-What...
-Unfollow.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.060
-Do you think--
-Blocked.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.603
-You're doing?
-Unsubscribe.

23:58.687 --> 23:59.855
From my makeup tutorials?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.940
I hate how you say "Hey, guys!"

24:02.023 --> 24:04.901
when you know I'm the only one
watching your stupid makeup tutorials.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.654
-Oh my God!
-You should just say, "Hey, Lola".

24:07.737 --> 24:09.823
And cat eyes are so over.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.409
You don't know
what you're saying right now.

24:12.492 --> 24:15.370
Do you even read  Teen Vogue?
It's political now.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.663
[crying] Oh, God!

24:16.746 --> 24:19.833
[groans]
His dimpled eggs are really tricky.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.918

24:23.003 --> 24:24.921

24:25.005 --> 24:26.298
Pretty ponytail!

24:26.673 --> 24:27.883
[Steve laughing]

24:31.052 --> 24:32.471
Shake your booty, Missy!

24:32.554 --> 24:36.433
It's more of a scoop then a shake,
but thanks!

24:36.516 --> 24:40.520
Come on, baby. Don't you wanna join in?
The Shame Wizard's gone.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.231
No. I just wanna be left alone.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.902
Oh, come on. You want to take a tinkle
on the principal's desk?

24:46.985 --> 24:48.778
Or take a tinkle on the vending machine?

24:48.862 --> 24:50.155
-No!
-What? You don't have to go?

24:50.238 --> 24:52.866
Stop! You keep making me do shitty things.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.784
I don't like who I am when I'm with you.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.203
I see. Well.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.788
[sighs] Maybe we should just take a break.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.333
-Good. Yes, go.
-All right, good.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.544
-We still going to watch  Riverdale  or...
-Stop!

25:04.628 --> 25:07.005
Should I save it?
'Cause I'm like, three ahead.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.215
Get out of my life!

25:08.298 --> 25:10.926
Well... I guess I'll see you later, baby.
