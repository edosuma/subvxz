00:01.879 --> 00:03.398
<i>Previously on</i> Madam Secretary...

00:03.784 --> 00:06.662
You will sign this deal,
or my government will bury you.

00:06.663 --> 00:08.092
We know that you have a spy

00:08.093 --> 00:10.276
<i>in my inner circle. If you tell us</i>

00:10.277 --> 00:12.445
who that is, we will have a deal.

00:12.446 --> 00:15.565
I promise I will do everything
in my power to keep you safe.

00:15.566 --> 00:16.738
<i>- There he is.</i>
- Abort!

00:16.739 --> 00:17.568
- Abort!
- What?

00:17.569 --> 00:18.584
Did we just give him up?

00:18.585 --> 00:20.704
I have to put national security first.

00:20.705 --> 00:21.784
Why couldn't you talk him out of it?

00:21.785 --> 00:23.914
He's an old spy, for God's sake!

00:23.915 --> 00:25.824
This is what happens when you try

00:25.825 --> 00:27.704
<i>to make a deal with the devil.</i>

00:27.705 --> 00:29.515
<i>You will both regret this.</i>

00:31.535 --> 00:33.244
(whooshing)

00:33.245 --> 00:35.345
(explosion booms)

00:38.665 --> 00:40.664

MAN: Falcon secured.
Repeat, Falcon secured.

01:00.762 --> 01:02.681
Initiate Evac Protocol Zion.

01:02.682 --> 01:04.090
What the hell just happened?

01:04.092 --> 01:05.841
That was Maria Ostrov's car.

01:05.842 --> 01:07.974
- Son of a bitch. - We've initiated
emergency evacuation protocol, sir.

01:07.975 --> 01:10.471
Air Force One will be
wheels up in nine minutes.

01:10.472 --> 01:12.551
Copy that. They're trying to pull Ostrov

01:12.552 --> 01:13.554
- from the wreck.
- Is she alive?

01:13.555 --> 01:14.732
Unknown, sir.

01:16.842 --> 01:18.841
I want to stay behind in Geneva,

01:18.842 --> 01:21.632
- see if I can liaise with the Russians.
- Negative, ma'am.

01:21.633 --> 01:23.131
The attackers might have other targets.

01:23.132 --> 01:24.841
If Maria Ostrov dies,

01:24.842 --> 01:26.551
this peace deal likely dies with her.

01:26.552 --> 01:29.471
With respect, sir...

01:29.472 --> 01:31.572
Do it.

01:32.802 --> 01:35.631
(sirens wailing)

01:35.632 --> 01:38.631
We've set up a meeting place
for you and General Doroshevich.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.512
Come this way.

01:39.513 --> 01:40.391
Okay. Thanks.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.432
More bad news.

01:41.433 --> 01:42.471
Of course there is.

01:42.472 --> 01:44.801
A radical Ukrainian nationalist
group called Knights of Kiev

01:44.802 --> 01:46.801
took credit for the
attack on Maria Ostrov.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.221
(sighs)

01:48.222 --> 01:49.841
God, are the Russians
losing their minds?

01:49.842 --> 01:51.511
What do you think?

01:51.512 --> 01:54.011
This is the group's
leader, Olek Zelinski.

01:54.012 --> 01:56.011
He made a statement saying
that the peace deal

01:56.012 --> 01:58.011
was a capitulation to Russia
and any further attempts

01:58.012 --> 02:01.402
to change Ukraine's border
will be met with more violence.

02:02.682 --> 02:05.261
Do they have any ties to
the Ukrainian government

02:05.262 --> 02:08.133
- or Bozek? - CIA's best guess
is no, but it's not definitive.

02:08.134 --> 02:12.221
Okay, um, reach out
to the Swiss. Ask them

02:12.222 --> 02:14.471
if they'll ground Melnik's plane
until I can talk to him.

02:14.472 --> 02:16.474
- Tell 'em the ask is coming from
the White House. - (phone ringing)

02:16.475 --> 02:18.094
- I...
- Ma'am, uh, I'm just...

02:18.095 --> 02:20.591
I'm glad that you're still with us.

02:20.592 --> 02:22.591
You, too. I-I got to take this.

02:22.592 --> 02:24.591
Yeah, yeah.

02:24.592 --> 02:25.979
ELIZABETH: <i>Henry?</i>

02:25.980 --> 02:27.149
Thank God you're okay.

02:27.150 --> 02:28.729
I-I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:28.730 --> 02:31.529
I... Blake called the kids,
so don't worry.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.529
He said you weren't home.
Where are you?

02:33.530 --> 02:35.979
I can't say.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.269
Listen, about what happened...

02:38.270 --> 02:39.939
I can't really talk
about that right now.

02:39.940 --> 02:42.149
I don't... I don't mean
right now. I was thinking

02:42.150 --> 02:44.149
when we get home.

02:44.150 --> 02:45.830
I don't know when that will be.

02:46.770 --> 02:48.870
Okay.

02:50.110 --> 02:52.189
I understand that, but...

02:52.190 --> 02:53.399
I love you.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.479
I love you, too.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.460
I've got to go.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.500
(beep)

03:03.440 --> 03:05.540
(indistinct chatter)

03:12.480 --> 03:13.979
She didn't make it.

03:13.980 --> 03:16.080
(exhales)

03:21.440 --> 03:23.439
FELLOWS: <i> Look, you got
burnt by the higher-ups.</i>

03:23.440 --> 03:25.189
<i>It's part of the job... believe me.</i>

03:25.190 --> 03:26.319
I didn't get burned.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.979
Dmitri did.

03:27.980 --> 03:30.399
Wherever the Russians have him,
he's paying for it now.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.399
Well, he did it to save his sister.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.319
And that's what we're
here to do, Henry.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.269
We have to get to Talia
before the Russians do.

03:36.270 --> 03:38.479
Because they will leverage
her to get more information.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.609
What about Dmitri? Is there any news?

03:40.610 --> 03:42.269
The fact that they're on
the hunt for his sister

03:42.270 --> 03:43.479
means he's still alive.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.479
And if he's still alive, there's hope.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.689
One good thing about the
Maria Ostrov situation is

03:47.690 --> 03:49.769
it throws a lot of cards up in the air.

03:49.770 --> 03:51.819
Dmitri could be one of 'em.

03:51.820 --> 03:53.830
Let's go.

03:54.940 --> 03:57.729
I appreciate your condolences,
Madam Secretary.

03:57.730 --> 03:59.717
But they won't bring
back President Ostrova,

03:59.718 --> 04:01.729
nor will they alter
the fact that Ukraine

04:01.730 --> 04:04.479
abrogated the ceasefire
by assassinating her.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.439
President Ostrova wanted peace.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.769
She didn't.

04:07.770 --> 04:10.029
I still don't know what you

04:10.030 --> 04:13.359
and your president said to her
in that room to get her to sign.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.609
In any event, she signed the treaty.

04:15.610 --> 04:17.939
I think we should honor her legacy

04:17.940 --> 04:20.899
by preserving her last
and greatest act.

04:20.899 --> 04:24.069
Prime Minister Salnikov
has just been sworn in

04:24.070 --> 04:25.569
as acting president.

04:25.570 --> 04:28.149
He has declared an
official mourning period.

04:28.150 --> 04:31.149
But in three days' time, believe me,

04:31.150 --> 04:34.319
the Ukrainians will be made to pay

04:34.320 --> 04:35.479
for this treachery.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.529
General, I...

04:37.530 --> 04:39.769
I understand your outrage.

04:39.770 --> 04:41.029
And I share it.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.318
But I must warn you,

04:42.319 --> 04:44.318
should you resume hostilities,

04:44.319 --> 04:46.318
the United States reserves the right

04:46.319 --> 04:48.158
to use all means

04:48.159 --> 04:51.419
to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.658
All means, General.

04:54.659 --> 04:56.618
Well,

04:56.619 --> 05:00.158
we have said what we needed to say.

05:00.159 --> 05:03.839
Good day, Madam Secretary.

05:07.069 --> 05:09.169
(sighs)

05:13.359 --> 05:15.358
HENRY: <i>When I told Dmitri</i>

05:15.359 --> 05:17.278
I was coming here for a conference,

05:17.279 --> 05:19.488
he asked me to come talk to you.

05:19.489 --> 05:22.158
So you just show up
and tell me I must go

05:22.159 --> 05:23.818
to the United States,

05:23.819 --> 05:26.618
on the very day that
President Ostrova is murdered?

05:26.619 --> 05:28.618
I think Dmitri was worried

05:28.619 --> 05:33.198
that this conflict could
get out of control.

05:33.199 --> 05:37.198
He wants you to go somewhere
where he knows you'll be safe.

05:37.199 --> 05:40.158
And he turned to you because
your wife is Secretary of State.

05:40.159 --> 05:42.568
Well, as I said, we became
friendly at the War College.

05:42.569 --> 05:43.738
But, yeah, I think

05:43.739 --> 05:45.738
my wife might have played a part in it.

05:45.739 --> 05:47.408
Wouldn't that make him a traitor?

05:47.409 --> 05:51.618
I think his first loyalty is
and always will be you.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.278
You should have seen him when
he heard about the drug trial.

05:54.279 --> 05:57.799
He would not stop badgering
them until they let you in.

05:59.029 --> 06:00.778
Yes. (chuckles)

06:00.779 --> 06:03.959
He saved my life.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.158
Professor McCord,

06:08.159 --> 06:10.158
I want to trust you.

06:10.159 --> 06:13.169
I'm going to ask you
to be honest with me.

06:14.739 --> 06:17.379
Tell me where my brother is.

06:19.119 --> 06:21.118
I don't know.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.238
Then I can't trust you.

06:22.239 --> 06:23.238
That's the truth.

06:23.239 --> 06:25.219
It's not good enough.

06:26.159 --> 06:27.908
Talia, listen to me.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.358
If agents from your government

06:30.359 --> 06:32.948
come and demand that you
go with them, don't do it.

06:32.949 --> 06:34.028
Run.

06:34.029 --> 06:35.278
Do you understand me?

06:35.279 --> 06:37.278
What good would that do?

06:37.279 --> 06:38.858
They always catch you.

06:38.859 --> 06:41.658
Besides, I should have
been dead months ago.

06:41.659 --> 06:46.068
I was resurrected in Stockholm,
thanks to my brother.

06:46.069 --> 06:51.169
So I'm going to wait right here,
where he can find me.

06:52.819 --> 06:55.448
ELIZABETH: <i>Minister Melnik.</i>

06:55.449 --> 06:57.618
Why on earth would we kill
the Russian president

06:57.619 --> 07:00.448
less than a day after she
agreed to end the war?

07:00.449 --> 07:03.118
And yet President Bozek
hid out in Ukraine

07:03.119 --> 07:05.068
instead of coming to the peace talks.

07:05.069 --> 07:07.419
Sure looks like he knew to stay away.

07:11.619 --> 07:14.719
Matt, Frank, can I
have the room, please?

07:21.029 --> 07:23.858
He was crazy enough
to hack Air Force One.

07:23.859 --> 07:27.618
Why should I believe he wouldn't
order a hit on Maria Ostrov?

07:27.619 --> 07:30.198
What do you want from me?
Should I pretend to be sad

07:30.199 --> 07:32.988
for the insane Russian dictator
who invaded my country?

07:32.989 --> 07:35.158
Well, I won't.

07:35.159 --> 07:37.705
The bitch got what she deserved,
Madam Secretary,

07:37.706 --> 07:38.994
and you know it.

07:38.995 --> 07:42.545
You're not exactly
helping your case here.

07:43.575 --> 07:48.925
Did you or your president give
the green light to Zelinski?

07:49.565 --> 07:52.354
Must be so nice to be American.

07:52.355 --> 07:54.774
To play God all the time.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.144
Speaking of playing God,

07:57.145 --> 08:00.144
you're aware we have
an extradition treaty

08:00.145 --> 08:01.234
with Switzerland.

08:01.235 --> 08:02.644
By this time tomorrow,

08:02.645 --> 08:05.404
you could be in federal
court, being arraigned

08:05.405 --> 08:07.984
on terrorism charges for
attacking Air Force One.

08:07.985 --> 08:10.644
I know that you were up
to your neck in that,

08:10.645 --> 08:12.854
right there with Bozek.

08:12.855 --> 08:15.354
So you and I need to get real clear

08:15.355 --> 08:17.274
on a few things right now.
Do you understand?

08:17.275 --> 08:20.024
Nothing you can do to me will be
worse than what will happen

08:20.025 --> 08:22.234
to my people if the
Russians resume their war.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.444
And that's gonna happen
in three days' time,

08:25.445 --> 08:27.104
unless your government

08:27.105 --> 08:29.524
gives them Zelinski.

08:29.525 --> 08:31.524
I have no idea where he is.

08:31.525 --> 08:34.943
Well, you better find him.
Or help us do it.

08:34.945 --> 08:37.443
Because if the Russians
get him before we do,

08:37.445 --> 08:39.443
we don't have any cards to play.

08:39.445 --> 08:40.813
And they <i> are</i> out for blood.

08:40.815 --> 08:43.313
President Bozek didn't order the hit.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.404
And he certainly doesn't condone it.

08:46.405 --> 08:51.404
Zelinski is a psychopath
masquerading as a patriot.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.404
Oh, see,

08:53.405 --> 08:56.404
that sounds like an excellent
start to the speech

08:56.405 --> 08:58.604
you're about to give.

08:58.605 --> 09:02.205
That is, if you want to go home.

09:04.606 --> 09:06.765
BLAKE: Yeah, so it's just that, and
then if you'd just sign the ones

09:06.766 --> 09:08.185
on top, that'd be great. Thanks.

09:08.186 --> 09:10.765
I've been away for, like, two days.

09:10.766 --> 09:13.395
What, did I buy another
house while I was gone?

09:13.396 --> 09:14.895
Uh, also, you are scheduled

09:14.896 --> 09:17.435
to update POTUS on developments
with Russia tomorrow morning

09:17.436 --> 09:18.436
at 9:00 a.m.

09:18.437 --> 09:19.435
Oh, speaking of which...

09:19.436 --> 09:20.081
Hi, Mommy.

09:20.082 --> 09:20.725
Hi, baby.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.265
Any word on their reaction

09:22.266 --> 09:23.331
to Melnik's speech?

09:23.332 --> 09:24.395
They remain unmoved.

09:24.396 --> 09:27.555
Oh. Well, on that cheery note,

09:27.556 --> 09:29.055
unless there's anything else,

09:29.056 --> 09:31.395
this is, I believe,
where we call it a night.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.935
Um...

09:33.936 --> 09:36.315
What?

09:36.316 --> 09:37.975
You know what,
it is hardly worth mentioning

09:37.976 --> 09:39.026
at such a perilous time.

09:39.027 --> 09:40.865
And yet...

09:40.866 --> 09:42.405
I'm going to get kicked out of school.

09:42.406 --> 09:43.655
What?

09:43.656 --> 09:44.656
(chuckles) Kids.

09:44.657 --> 09:45.655
Wait, what?

09:45.656 --> 09:48.865
Okay. So, while strictly
speaking that is true,

09:48.866 --> 09:50.325
um, what you should know is...

09:50.326 --> 09:51.988
- Well, here's what I know.
- Why don't you start?

09:51.989 --> 09:52.617
Yep.

09:52.618 --> 09:54.406
Okay. You know how you
and Dad are supposed

09:54.407 --> 09:55.525
to do mandatory volunteer hours

09:55.526 --> 09:56.736
at my school?

09:56.737 --> 09:57.945
Let's just whistle by

09:57.946 --> 10:00.865
that oxymoron and say yes, I'm aware.

10:00.866 --> 10:03.115
Well, you guys have
done zero this year.

10:03.116 --> 10:05.735
Well, I-I've been a little busy.

10:05.736 --> 10:08.325
So has Dr. McCord. Which I have
explained to the dean's office

10:08.326 --> 10:11.405
numerous times in our
many, many e-mails

10:11.406 --> 10:12.991
back and forth.

10:12.992 --> 10:14.575
But they remain unmoved?

10:14.576 --> 10:16.615
Unless you and your husband

10:16.616 --> 10:19.825
volunteer at least three
hours this semester,

10:19.826 --> 10:22.735
they reserve the right to... disinvite

10:22.736 --> 10:23.841
Alison next year.

10:23.842 --> 10:24.945
Oh.

10:24.946 --> 10:27.945
Well, you got to hand
it to the Quakers.

10:27.946 --> 10:29.695
They use nonthreatening language

10:29.696 --> 10:31.945
even when they're threatening you.

10:31.946 --> 10:34.735
So you and Dad have to work
a booth at the Winter Carnival

10:34.736 --> 10:35.841
on Wednesday or else.

10:35.842 --> 10:36.945
(sighs)

10:36.946 --> 10:38.365
You tell those Quakers

10:38.366 --> 10:40.485
they drive a harder bargain
than the Russians.

10:40.486 --> 10:42.075
And the McCords

10:42.076 --> 10:43.825
will represent.

10:43.826 --> 10:45.655
On that note,

10:45.656 --> 10:46.825
I'm going to bed. Love you.

10:46.826 --> 10:47.826
Love you.

10:47.827 --> 10:48.825
Love you.

10:48.826 --> 10:50.235
That was awkward.

10:50.236 --> 10:51.716
Right.

10:52.696 --> 10:54.136
DALTON: <i> All right,
so where is Zelinski?</i>

10:54.137 --> 10:56.765
Gone to ground, sir.
However, intel indicates

10:56.766 --> 10:59.265
he may be hiding out with
his followers in the forest

10:59.266 --> 11:00.845
somewhere in Western Ukraine.

11:00.846 --> 11:03.135
Not exactly pinpoint accuracy, Admiral.

11:03.136 --> 11:05.135
We're working the problem, sir.
But, Mr. President,

11:05.136 --> 11:07.055
I must tell you, he and his group

11:07.056 --> 11:08.925
are heavily armed
and expecting a fight.

11:08.926 --> 11:10.975
If we can find Zelinski
in two days' time,

11:10.976 --> 11:12.805
taking him alive won't be easy.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.345
There will be casualties, sir.

11:14.346 --> 11:16.555
The idea of doing any more dirty work

11:16.556 --> 11:18.515
for that bastard Bozek makes me sick.

11:18.516 --> 11:21.175
What we need right now is leverage,

11:21.176 --> 11:23.425
and it is in short supply.

11:23.426 --> 11:27.015
Zelinski is our best shot
to keep the Russians

11:27.016 --> 11:29.305
from breaking the treaty
and relaunching the war.

11:29.306 --> 11:31.175
But if that happens,
there's no telling how long

11:31.176 --> 11:32.975
we can contain the
battle space to Ukraine.

11:32.976 --> 11:35.215
The conflict could become global.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.215
Find Zelinski, Admiral.

11:37.216 --> 11:39.116
Yes, sir.

11:42.266 --> 11:49.268

11:55.614 --> 11:56.299
(knocking)

11:56.300 --> 11:57.485
So, hi.

11:57.486 --> 12:00.866
Hi. Those were some
pretty urgent texts.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.116
What's up?

12:02.117 --> 12:03.446
You know that I would never

12:03.447 --> 12:04.786
trade on our personal relationship

12:04.787 --> 12:06.696
unless it was an emergency, right?

12:06.697 --> 12:09.076
Glenn, we don't exactly have

12:09.077 --> 12:11.156
a personal relationship anymore.

12:11.157 --> 12:13.536
I know. No, we had three lovely months,

12:13.537 --> 12:15.156
followed by a sudden, painful lunch.

12:15.157 --> 12:16.326
Oh.

12:16.327 --> 12:18.366
You know I was
coming out of a very long

12:18.367 --> 12:19.746
and very difficult relationship.

12:19.747 --> 12:22.406
Look, I'm sorry, it's not
important right now.

12:22.407 --> 12:24.866
If I told you I needed
the secretary's help,

12:24.867 --> 12:26.746
could you get me some time with her?

12:26.747 --> 12:28.196
Like, today?

12:28.197 --> 12:31.986
Well, given she's Secretary of State,

12:31.987 --> 12:33.946
not space...

12:33.947 --> 12:35.076
what exactly are you hoping

12:35.077 --> 12:36.696
she can help you with?

12:36.697 --> 12:39.286
Saving the lives of six astronauts.

12:39.287 --> 12:40.446
<i>Approximately four hours ago,</i>

12:40.447 --> 12:43.246
the North Koreans launched a satellite,

12:43.247 --> 12:45.406
uh, without proper preclearance

12:45.407 --> 12:48.076
from NASA or other
relevant space agencies.

12:48.077 --> 12:49.406
Isn't that the third time

12:49.407 --> 12:50.826
they've done that this year?

12:50.827 --> 12:52.536
The fourth, actually.

12:52.537 --> 12:56.156
The North Koreans are
sometimes less than helpful.

12:56.157 --> 12:59.576
Uh, their satellite
exploded in low orbit,

12:59.577 --> 13:02.326
100 kilometers below the
International Space Station.

13:02.327 --> 13:05.786
The force of that explosion
propelled debris

13:05.787 --> 13:08.366
into the ISS, which has sustained

13:08.367 --> 13:10.446
significant damage.

13:10.447 --> 13:13.246
The lives of all six astronauts
aboard are in peril,

13:13.247 --> 13:14.826
but particularly those

13:14.827 --> 13:18.196
of the three trapped here, two
Americans and one from Japan.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.246
They are without their E.M.U.'s.

13:20.247 --> 13:23.906
Oh, sorry... their
extravehicular mobility units.

13:23.907 --> 13:25.116
Their-their space suits.

13:25.117 --> 13:27.076
And two of the modules

13:27.077 --> 13:28.906
between them and the
nearest escape capsule

13:28.907 --> 13:30.246
are depressurized.

13:30.247 --> 13:32.036
What about the three
Russian cosmonauts?

13:32.037 --> 13:33.406
The escape capsule

13:33.407 --> 13:35.286
nearest them has been
compromised by debris,

13:35.287 --> 13:39.156
so they're also trapped on
the station, but they have

13:39.157 --> 13:40.246
taken shelter in this module

13:40.247 --> 13:42.446
on the opposite side of the station.

13:42.447 --> 13:46.406
Which remains pressurized, so
they're safe for the time being.

13:46.407 --> 13:48.366
Sorry, not an astrophysicist,

13:48.367 --> 13:50.406
but can't the Russians just

13:50.407 --> 13:52.656
bring the Americans extra space suits?

13:52.657 --> 13:54.326
Uh, well, yes and no.

13:54.327 --> 13:55.986
But... but mostly no.

13:55.987 --> 13:57.986
That would require a space walk

13:57.987 --> 13:59.286
outside the station,

13:59.287 --> 14:01.616
to then pass E.M.U.'s
through an air lock

14:01.617 --> 14:03.196
to our guys, and,

14:03.197 --> 14:05.196
unfortunately, the suits are too bulky

14:05.197 --> 14:07.196
to be placed in the air lock.

14:07.197 --> 14:09.246
This is where the secretary comes in.

14:09.247 --> 14:11.286
The Russians, in their wisdom,

14:11.287 --> 14:14.036
are planning to send up an unmanned

14:14.037 --> 14:15.906
Soyuz rescue capsule.

14:15.907 --> 14:18.246
They've been developing a new

14:18.247 --> 14:20.326
modular E.M.U. suit.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.286
Yeah, these are suits
that could be taken apart

14:23.287 --> 14:25.036
and then handed piece by piece

14:25.037 --> 14:27.616
through the air lock here
at the end of Kibo Lab.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.656
Let me guess: Russians don't
actually have the suits yet.

14:30.657 --> 14:33.116
A tragically excellent guess.

14:33.117 --> 14:34.866
Uh, but the good news

14:34.867 --> 14:37.446
is the Chinese just might have
some that are ready to go.

14:37.447 --> 14:40.246
You won't be surprised
to learn that China

14:40.247 --> 14:42.826
has been covertly
cribbing Russian technology

14:42.827 --> 14:45.406
as well as our own to develop

14:45.407 --> 14:46.677
their own space program.

14:46.678 --> 14:47.946
Okay, so in order

14:47.947 --> 14:49.326
to save the astronauts,

14:49.327 --> 14:51.486
the secretary has to strike a deal

14:51.487 --> 14:54.696
with two of the most prideful
nations on Earth, one of which

14:54.697 --> 14:56.116
we're currently fighting in a war?

14:56.117 --> 14:57.616
When does the Soyuz lift off?

14:57.617 --> 14:59.576
In 14 hours.

14:59.577 --> 15:01.486
They either need to repair

15:01.487 --> 15:04.446
vital systems on the
station or get off of it.

15:04.447 --> 15:08.076
In order to do either,
they need the suits.

15:08.077 --> 15:10.446
Or they'll die.

15:10.447 --> 15:12.076
HENRY: <i>So what's your plan...</i>

15:12.077 --> 15:14.406
just let her get picked
up by the Russians?

15:14.407 --> 15:15.986
I told you, we have people stationed

15:15.987 --> 15:17.536
all around that hospital. That's not

15:17.537 --> 15:19.159
- gonna happen.
- But you can't leave a team

15:19.160 --> 15:20.486
in Stockholm forever.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.576
Oh, you got that right.

15:21.577 --> 15:23.406
Upstairs is already sweating me.

15:23.407 --> 15:26.746
What did they say
about reading Talia in?

15:26.747 --> 15:28.036
It's under consideration.

15:28.037 --> 15:29.576
Look, the only way

15:29.577 --> 15:31.906
to get her to trust us
is if I can tell her

15:31.907 --> 15:33.366
what my real connection to Dmitri is.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.616
Look, I understand your
frustration, Henry.

15:34.617 --> 15:36.196
I don't think you do.

15:36.197 --> 15:38.948
- The least we can do for Dmitri
at this point - (phone buzzes)

15:38.949 --> 15:40.527
is to guarantee his
sister's protection.

15:40.528 --> 15:42.197
We need to get her into our custody.

15:42.198 --> 15:44.157
So, what, you just want to
grab her up off the street?

15:44.158 --> 15:46.236
Yes. For her sake and Dmitri's,

15:46.237 --> 15:47.217
yes, absolutely.

15:47.218 --> 15:48.196
(phone buzzes)

15:48.197 --> 15:50.337
(sighs)

15:51.697 --> 15:53.127
What is it?

15:54.947 --> 15:56.566
Our sources indicate that the Russians

15:56.567 --> 15:58.797
are standing down on
trying to find Talia.

16:03.277 --> 16:05.467
Because they don't need her anymore.

16:08.237 --> 16:10.167
I'm sorry, Henry.

16:16.117 --> 16:18.217
He was 24 years old.

16:21.827 --> 16:23.297
24.

16:27.197 --> 16:29.087
Where are you going?

16:30.027 --> 16:32.276
To give Talia the news.

16:32.277 --> 16:34.377
I owe her brother that much.

16:48.202 --> 16:49.784
ELIZABETH: <i>So we've blocked China</i>

16:49.785 --> 16:52.865
from participation on the
International Space Station,

16:52.866 --> 16:55.575
and now we need their help to save it?

16:55.576 --> 16:58.155
Oh, they are gonna love this.

16:58.156 --> 17:00.075
I mean, this is going
to make their day.

17:00.076 --> 17:03.075
To be fair, China was
banned by Congress

17:03.076 --> 17:05.865
over concerns about
intellectual property theft.

17:05.866 --> 17:08.115
Which have since been
borne out, obviously.

17:08.116 --> 17:09.522
Yes, well, guess who's about to lose

17:09.523 --> 17:11.413
a whole lot of leverage
in that argument.

17:12.893 --> 17:16.602
But these modular space suits...
if the Chinese

17:16.603 --> 17:18.732
admit that they have them
and the Russians allow us

17:18.733 --> 17:20.392
to send them up,

17:20.393 --> 17:22.123
they can save our astronauts?

17:23.193 --> 17:24.652
Well, we can't say for sure,

17:24.653 --> 17:27.163
but they are the best chance we've got.

17:28.693 --> 17:31.982
Well, just so you know,
this call is going to entail

17:31.983 --> 17:34.361
what we in diplomatic circles

17:34.362 --> 17:37.212
refer to as me eating
a big plate of crap.

17:38.152 --> 17:40.271
Roger that, ma'am.

17:40.272 --> 17:43.481
I'm sorry, I can't help
but smile at the irony.

17:43.482 --> 17:44.981
Yes, I-I wish

17:44.982 --> 17:48.811
we could savor it all day,
but we're running out of time.

17:48.812 --> 17:50.731
The Soyuz is set to lift off

17:50.732 --> 17:52.441
from Kazakhstan in ten hours.

17:52.442 --> 17:54.231
Would China be willing to send

17:54.232 --> 17:55.811
the space suits or not?

17:55.812 --> 17:58.481
If we had such suits...
what were they called again?

17:58.482 --> 17:59.861
Modular extravehicular

17:59.862 --> 18:01.941
mobility units.

18:01.942 --> 18:04.571
You see, the nomenclature eludes me.

18:04.572 --> 18:06.481
But if we had such suits to offer,

18:06.482 --> 18:08.521
we would want something in return.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.861
Beyond the opportunity
to save six astronauts?

18:11.862 --> 18:15.271
From a crisis not of our
making, on a space station

18:15.272 --> 18:17.611
from which we have been
humiliatingly blocked.

18:17.612 --> 18:21.441
You turned a blind eye to your
client state North Korea's

18:21.442 --> 18:24.941
reckless satellite launches,
which precipitated said event.

18:24.942 --> 18:26.941
So "not of our making"

18:26.942 --> 18:29.651
is debatable, to say the least.

18:29.652 --> 18:31.651
You have a peculiar way of asking

18:31.652 --> 18:33.731
for a favor, Madam Secretary.

18:33.732 --> 18:35.571
Our president is prepared

18:35.572 --> 18:37.571
to lobby Congress to lift

18:37.572 --> 18:39.901
the NASA exclusion policy

18:39.902 --> 18:43.021
and unblock China's
participation on the ISS.

18:43.022 --> 18:46.361
I'll convey your request and get
back to you with an answer.

18:46.362 --> 18:49.372
Quickly, please.

18:50.312 --> 18:51.811
I have POTUS on the phone.

18:51.812 --> 18:53.752
Oh.

18:55.112 --> 18:56.691
Mr. President.

18:56.692 --> 19:01.441
Bess, I wanted to tell you that
I received a report from DIA.

19:01.442 --> 19:03.571
It confirms that Captain Dmitri Petrov

19:03.572 --> 19:05.042
has died in Russia.

19:06.732 --> 19:08.832
I see.

19:11.112 --> 19:13.771
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. President.

19:13.772 --> 19:15.912
I just thought you should know.

19:16.862 --> 19:18.872
Thank you, sir.

19:31.772 --> 19:33.872
Hi.

19:36.072 --> 19:37.787
Hey.

19:39.572 --> 19:41.611
I'm so glad you're all right.

19:41.612 --> 19:43.481
I'm all right, I'm fine.
Are you all right?

19:43.482 --> 19:45.151
I'm just really tired. I'll go to bed.

19:45.152 --> 19:46.691

19:46.692 --> 19:48.731
Well, maybe you could take the day off.

19:48.732 --> 19:50.731
No. (sighs)

19:50.732 --> 19:52.981
Oh, I got the e-mail about
Alison's school thing.

19:52.982 --> 19:54.401
I'll be there.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.172
Good. I-I heard about Dmitri.

19:58.192 --> 20:00.611
I'm so sorry, Henry.

20:00.612 --> 20:02.691
Aren't we all?

20:02.692 --> 20:04.901
It was the right call.
I know you understand that.

20:04.902 --> 20:06.271
Intellectually, yeah.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.071
But we were right there.

20:08.072 --> 20:09.481
He was a couple yards away.

20:09.482 --> 20:11.571
All we had to do was open the van door.

20:11.572 --> 20:14.212
When I think about
how he must have died...

20:15.862 --> 20:18.901
Look, I love you, but I can't
talk about this right now.

20:18.902 --> 20:21.111
I'm afraid I might say something
that I can't take back.

20:21.112 --> 20:22.672
So can we do it later?

20:23.902 --> 20:25.941
Yeah.

20:25.942 --> 20:27.691
Okay, um...

20:27.692 --> 20:29.792

20:36.552 --> 20:38.631
So China's in?

20:38.632 --> 20:39.711
Ugh, not yet.

20:39.712 --> 20:41.051
They have conditions.

20:41.052 --> 20:42.591
Shocker.

20:42.592 --> 20:44.341
They want recognition
as a space partner...

20:44.342 --> 20:46.921
technology sharing, inclusion
on the space station.

20:46.922 --> 20:48.671
That's gonna take an act of Congress,

20:48.672 --> 20:50.801
which is not going to happen

20:50.802 --> 20:53.881
in the few hours before the launch.

20:53.882 --> 20:57.671
But we need 'em, so
promise them the moon.

20:57.672 --> 21:00.352
Well, not the actual moon.
That would be crazy.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.801
I'm a little tired.

21:02.802 --> 21:05.341
Bold language, vague specifics.
Understood.

21:05.342 --> 21:07.751
Until we can get Russia
to agree to take their help,

21:07.752 --> 21:09.711
which is a big if.

21:09.712 --> 21:11.751
You'll need to tread carefully.

No, I mean,

21:15.382 --> 21:16.991
the Russians are proud
of their space program.

21:16.992 --> 21:18.871
Like, really proud.

21:18.872 --> 21:20.451
They would rather let our guys die

21:20.452 --> 21:21.781
than be publicly caught

General Doroshevich right away.

located Zelinski

21:29.662 --> 21:31.215
at his hideout in Ukraine.

21:31.216 --> 21:32.295
An operation is getting underway,

21:32.296 --> 21:34.566
so you're wanted at

Chinese have modular

21:40.336 --> 21:42.585
extravehicular mobility suits

21:42.586 --> 21:44.465
developed on our prototype.

21:44.466 --> 21:46.175
Oh. I see.

21:46.176 --> 21:49.625
If the Chinese can deliver them
prior to our launch time,

21:49.626 --> 21:51.545
we are willing to put
them on the Soyuz.

21:51.546 --> 21:54.965
ELIZABETH: Well, that is very
gracious of you, General.

21:54.966 --> 21:57.545
Yes, we Russians choose kindness,

21:57.546 --> 21:59.335
even in our grief.

21:59.336 --> 22:02.375
The suits are Russian
in design and therefore

22:02.376 --> 22:04.375
will be described as such.

22:04.376 --> 22:06.755
If the Chinese are
mentioned, we will deny it.

22:06.756 --> 22:08.045
If a rescue is effected,

22:08.046 --> 22:10.294
Russia will receive sole credit.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.373
But given the debris
around the station,

22:12.374 --> 22:14.452
most likely such an attempt
will be unadvised.

22:14.453 --> 22:18.252
And, of course, the capsule
can only carry three persons.

22:18.253 --> 22:21.712

ordered to depart with it.

22:21.713 --> 22:24.252
Of course. I understand completely.

29:48.206 --> 29:50.325
She was then murdered
by our adversaries,

29:50.326 --> 29:52.165
which nullifies the peace treaty

29:52.166 --> 29:54.915
and any belief in Ukraine's good faith.

29:54.916 --> 29:56.875
General, I'm gonna be blunt.

29:56.876 --> 29:59.115
You weren't winning the war.

29:59.116 --> 30:01.915
What makes you think this
time will be any different?

30:01.916 --> 30:04.745
The people are with us now,
and so is the winter.

30:04.746 --> 30:07.325
When your handful of
advisors begin dying

30:07.326 --> 30:09.165
in the snow halfway around the world,

30:09.166 --> 30:10.285
how long do you think

30:10.286 --> 30:12.245
the American public will stand for it?

30:12.246 --> 30:14.676
You don't want to find out.

30:16.576 --> 30:19.325
Take Zelinski, General.

30:19.326 --> 30:20.875
Take the deal.

30:20.876 --> 30:22.705
We end our period of mourning

30:22.706 --> 30:25.415
for our late president in a few hours.

30:25.416 --> 30:30.596
And then we will see how
strong your resolve is.

30:33.286 --> 30:36.176
Ma'am, you're gonna want to see this.

30:37.666 --> 30:40.205
We're patched into the Russian feed.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.705
(man speaking Russian)

30:41.706 --> 30:44.415
WOMAN (translating):
Station, this is Flight.

30:44.416 --> 30:48.205
Positive latching of
the vehicle confirmed.

30:48.206 --> 30:49.575
We have a good dock.

30:49.576 --> 30:51.705
(man speaking Russian)

30:51.706 --> 30:53.705
Station, this is Flight.

30:53.706 --> 30:57.285
The debris environment
is too hazardous.

30:57.286 --> 31:00.375
You are a no-go for
extravehicular activity.

31:00.376 --> 31:02.375
Begin station evacuation operations.

31:02.376 --> 31:05.115
Damn it. What good are the suits
if our guys can't get them?

31:05.116 --> 31:06.955
WOMAN (translating):
Negative, Mission Control.

31:06.956 --> 31:10.995
We will attempt a rescue of
our colleagues in Kibo Lab.

31:10.996 --> 31:14.825
(man speaking Russian)

31:14.826 --> 31:17.995
Negative, Station.
You are no-go for E.V.A.

31:17.996 --> 31:19.621
Shut up, dude.

31:19.622 --> 31:21.245
Repeat, you are a no-go for E.V.A.

31:21.246 --> 31:22.995
(speaking Russian)

31:22.996 --> 31:24.285
WOMAN (translating): Negative, Flight.

31:24.286 --> 31:25.915
Beginning preparations for E.V.A.

31:25.916 --> 31:28.245
ASTRONAUT:
Lev, this is Station Commander.

31:28.246 --> 31:29.575
I concur with your ground controller.

31:29.576 --> 31:31.375
You are no-go for E.V.A.

31:31.376 --> 31:33.995
Don't risk your lives for us, buddy.

31:33.996 --> 31:36.285
Proceed to the Soyuz
capsule and depart.

31:36.286 --> 31:37.955
Negative, Station Commander.

31:37.956 --> 31:40.915
Prepare the air lock to
receive the modular E.M.U.'s.

31:40.916 --> 31:43.035
We are coming for you, James.

31:43.036 --> 31:45.096
Well, how about that.

31:59.356 --> 32:01.456
ELIZABETH: Mr. President?

32:05.316 --> 32:08.985
So the war's back on in a few hours.

32:08.986 --> 32:13.275
Well, barring any
last-minute breakthroughs,

32:13.276 --> 32:17.485
that's the message Doroshevich
is sending, yes, sir.

32:17.486 --> 32:20.815
What do we know about
Acting President Salnikov?

32:20.816 --> 32:24.275
He was in Pavel Ostrov's
circle for many years.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.735
Other than that, not much.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.775
Which is probably why

32:27.776 --> 32:30.565
Maria Ostrov chose him
to be her prime minister.

32:30.566 --> 32:32.626
Hmm.

32:34.446 --> 32:37.445
If only those cosmonauts were
running the show over there.

32:37.446 --> 32:40.586
That would help.

32:45.356 --> 32:46.956
You okay, Bess?

32:48.236 --> 32:51.506
Me? Yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm fine.

32:56.776 --> 32:58.775
I was just thinking

32:58.776 --> 33:02.405
about all the lives that
we've lost trying to make

33:02.406 --> 33:04.405
this peace deal work.

33:04.406 --> 33:08.695
Anton Gorev, the Delta Force team.

33:08.696 --> 33:11.565
Yeah, Henry's asset.

33:11.566 --> 33:13.485
I just feel like

33:13.486 --> 33:16.235
I'm-I'm moving all these lives around

33:16.236 --> 33:18.315
on this chessboard.

33:18.316 --> 33:20.546
And for what?

33:23.446 --> 33:25.695
I'm sorry, sir.

33:25.696 --> 33:27.315
That's not... it...

33:27.316 --> 33:30.735
it's not productive and...

33:30.736 --> 33:34.115
No, like I said, you know, I am...

33:34.116 --> 33:36.336
I'm fine.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.695
My, uh...

33:39.696 --> 33:43.336
my first engagement with
the enemy in Vietnam...

33:45.316 --> 33:48.716
...I'd been in country about a week.

33:51.656 --> 33:53.815
It was early May,

33:53.816 --> 33:56.735
just before the wet season.

33:56.736 --> 34:01.195
Took command of a platoon
at 50% strength,

34:01.196 --> 34:03.025
whose last platoon leader

34:03.026 --> 34:06.716
stepped on a land mine the week before.

34:08.735 --> 34:13.565
We were in a valley
near the Laotian border,

34:13.565 --> 34:16.295
taking fire from a ridgeline.

34:18.190 --> 34:21.150
Couldn't just sit there
and get all shot to hell

34:21.150 --> 34:26.270
waiting for the air support, so...

34:26.271 --> 34:30.610
I sent a squad up to flank 'em,

34:30.610 --> 34:34.751
even though I knew they were
probably ready for that.

34:35.690 --> 34:38.020
They were.

34:38.021 --> 34:40.070
Somehow or other,

34:40.071 --> 34:42.770
we took the damn ridge,

34:42.771 --> 34:46.270
not that it mattered much in the end.

34:46.271 --> 34:50.230
I lost three men that day.

34:50.231 --> 34:53.310
Kids, really, looking back on it.

34:53.311 --> 34:56.371
Hell, so was I.

34:57.481 --> 34:59.480
Afterwards, we were
waiting for the Hueys,

34:59.481 --> 35:03.520
and I was standing next to the bodies,

35:03.521 --> 35:08.150
wrapped in their ponchos in the mud.

35:08.151 --> 35:11.150
And all of a sudden,

35:11.151 --> 35:16.440
the sky just split open
and it started to rain.

35:16.441 --> 35:19.730
Hardest rain I'd ever seen.

35:19.731 --> 35:23.270
And I remember thinking,

35:23.271 --> 35:25.980
I'm going to have to find a dry place

35:25.981 --> 35:28.871
to write these boys' parents.

35:31.401 --> 35:33.940
Later on, our company commander

35:33.941 --> 35:35.610
put me up for a medal.

35:35.611 --> 35:39.360
And I said, "Sir, I don't
believe I deserve one."

35:39.361 --> 35:42.190
And he said, "Son...

35:42.191 --> 35:45.440
"the medal isn't for what you did.

35:45.441 --> 35:47.961
It's for living with it."

35:50.311 --> 35:52.900
That's all we can do, Bess.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.110
Lead as wisely as we can,

35:55.111 --> 35:56.650
and then...

35:56.651 --> 35:59.331
carry the weight of it as best we can.

36:16.571 --> 36:19.371
I-I wonder...

36:21.271 --> 36:23.570
...if that's how
General Doroshevich feels

36:23.571 --> 36:25.310
about his medals.

36:25.311 --> 36:28.190
I think it's worth trying to find out.

36:28.191 --> 36:30.690
DALTON: <i>Mr. President, General.</i>

36:30.691 --> 36:33.520
As we speak, your heroic cosmonauts

36:33.521 --> 36:36.610
are engaging in a record
number of space walks

36:36.611 --> 36:38.360
to provide their American comrades

36:38.361 --> 36:41.400
with the space suits they
need to save their lives.

36:41.401 --> 36:46.440
Their heroism is an inspiration
to the entire world.

36:46.441 --> 36:48.810
Can we not follow their example

36:48.811 --> 36:50.424
and put aside our differences

36:50.425 --> 36:51.883
for the greater good?

36:51.884 --> 36:53.269
ELIZABETH: We want to urge you

36:53.270 --> 36:55.928
to reconsider our offer, Mr. President,

36:55.929 --> 36:57.348
and preserve the peace

36:57.349 --> 36:59.768
that so many have lost
their lives trying to secure,

36:59.769 --> 37:02.268
including President Ostrova...

37:02.269 --> 37:04.968
Your words are most inspirational.

37:04.969 --> 37:08.058
Regrettably they will not bring
back our murdered president.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.348
We have nothing further to discuss.

37:10.349 --> 37:13.018
General, Mr. President.

37:13.019 --> 37:15.728
While we have no wish
for further conflict,

37:15.729 --> 37:18.018
we are prepared for it if necessary.

37:18.019 --> 37:22.308
But I'm getting tired of sending
good people to their deaths.

37:22.309 --> 37:24.098
Aren't you?

37:24.099 --> 37:26.228
I fail to see...

37:26.229 --> 37:28.199
Indeed I am, Mr. President.

37:29.599 --> 37:32.468
And so are my people.

37:32.469 --> 37:35.369
Then let's talk peace.

37:36.679 --> 37:38.239
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

37:42.139 --> 37:44.098
Hey. I got your text.

37:44.099 --> 37:45.678
What's up?

37:45.679 --> 37:48.058
Well, thought you should know,
uh, we're just getting word now

37:48.059 --> 37:50.199
that the peace deal is
going to stick after all.

37:51.179 --> 37:52.518
(sighs)

37:52.519 --> 37:53.768
That's good news.

37:53.769 --> 37:55.058
It's great news.

37:55.059 --> 37:56.348
What are you drinking, Professor?

37:56.349 --> 37:58.058
Uh, no, I'm okay. Thanks.

37:58.059 --> 37:59.348
PERRY: Come on, man, loosen up.

37:59.349 --> 38:00.901
The four of us in this
room had as much to do

38:00.902 --> 38:03.021
with the Russians throwing
in the towel as anyone.

38:03.022 --> 38:05.461
Anyone except the kid who's not here.

38:06.376 --> 38:08.230
FELLOWS: You flew combat
sorties in the Gulf War.

38:08.231 --> 38:10.443
- This can't all be new to you.
- The difference is

38:10.444 --> 38:11.980
I never looked anybody in the eye

38:11.981 --> 38:13.020
and promised them they'd be okay,

38:13.021 --> 38:14.671
and then dropped a bomb on them.

38:16.191 --> 38:18.291
It was a very unusual circumstance.

38:20.021 --> 38:22.110
So everybody keeps telling me.

38:22.111 --> 38:24.921
Look, you're a really
great handler, Henry.

38:24.922 --> 38:28.041
We could not have done it without you.

38:28.042 --> 38:31.211
But now that it is done...

38:31.212 --> 38:32.921
so am I.

38:32.922 --> 38:34.791
I quit.

38:34.792 --> 38:36.131
(wry chuckle)

38:36.132 --> 38:38.207
Yeah, it's a little more
complicated than that.

38:38.208 --> 38:40.617
Actually, it's not.
It's amazingly simple.

38:40.618 --> 38:43.657
But hey, if you want
to drink, let's drink.

38:43.658 --> 38:47.367
Here's to Captain Dmitri Petrov.

38:47.368 --> 38:50.037
And to paraphrase
our greatest president,

38:50.038 --> 38:52.997
"The world will little
note nor long remember

38:52.998 --> 38:56.308
what we say here, but it can
never forget what he did here."

38:59.248 --> 39:01.308
May he rest in peace.

39:06.538 --> 39:08.868
NEWSWOMAN: Russian cosmonauts
undertook an amazing

39:08.869 --> 39:10.741
nine consecutive space walks

39:10.742 --> 39:13.288
to save their American
and Japanese colleagues

39:13.289 --> 39:15.127
aboard the International Space Station.

39:15.128 --> 39:16.258
We did it.

39:16.259 --> 39:18.244
Well, actually, the secretary did it.

39:18.245 --> 39:19.265
No, they did it.

39:19.266 --> 39:20.284
No, I mean...

39:20.285 --> 39:21.914
we all did it.

39:21.915 --> 39:24.994
Russia, China and the U.S.?

39:24.995 --> 39:26.704
I mean, how often does that happen?

39:26.705 --> 39:28.074
Cheers.

39:28.075 --> 39:28.745
Cheers.

39:28.746 --> 39:29.414
Cheers.

39:29.415 --> 39:30.664
GLENN: <i>You got to admit,</i>

39:30.665 --> 39:33.574
we make a pretty good team.

39:33.575 --> 39:35.475
We do.

39:36.455 --> 39:38.414
So... lunch?

39:38.415 --> 39:40.874
(sighs)

39:40.875 --> 39:43.200
The rescue reportedly
required a great deal

39:43.201 --> 39:44.914
- Hey, girls.
- of high-level diplomacy here on Earth,

39:44.915 --> 39:47.374
as American and Russian
officials struggled

39:47.375 --> 39:48.784
to find a way forward

39:48.785 --> 39:51.204
against the backdrop of
the conflict in Ukraine.

39:51.205 --> 39:54.244
There's good news tonight
on that front as well.

39:54.245 --> 39:55.954
With a statement from the White House

39:55.955 --> 39:57.664
asserting that the broad outlines

39:57.665 --> 39:59.954
of a cease-fire have been...

39:59.955 --> 40:01.287
- (turns off TV)
- The White House called.

40:01.288 --> 40:03.954
They're of the opinion we
shouldn't pursue Bozek,

40:03.955 --> 40:06.914
Melnik or any of their
cohorts further for the hack

40:06.915 --> 40:08.204
of Air Force One.

40:08.205 --> 40:10.454
They feel Ukraine will fracture

40:10.455 --> 40:12.494
without Bozek and his
government in power,

40:12.495 --> 40:15.784
which would be dangerous
for the peace deal.

40:15.785 --> 40:17.515
They want to know if you agree.

40:19.495 --> 40:21.935
Sure. Why not?

40:23.665 --> 40:25.074
In Russia...

40:25.075 --> 40:26.624
(sighs)

40:26.625 --> 40:29.164
...they're selling this peace deal

40:29.165 --> 40:33.595
like it was Maria
Ostrov's greatest wish.

40:35.495 --> 40:40.244
Like she was the Mother
Teresa of Moscow.

40:40.245 --> 40:41.784
Can you believe that?

40:41.785 --> 40:43.914
(sighs heavily)

40:43.915 --> 40:47.164
Peace is a beautiful thing, Blake.

40:47.165 --> 40:49.534
Making peace...

40:49.535 --> 40:51.385
not so much.

40:52.665 --> 40:54.494
Night.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.345
Good night, ma'am.

This space station stuff

It's like a miracle.

Okay, no, the miracle was Dad

staying an extra two hours
at the Winter Carnival.

41:16.495 --> 41:19.074

Wow. Really?

41:21.205 --> 41:22.914
I'm pretty sure I'm a student for life.

41:22.915 --> 41:24.417
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Which, for the record,

41:24.418 --> 41:26.034
means more volunteering, guys.

41:26.035 --> 41:27.874
Well, I love it, so...

41:27.875 --> 41:28.580
Hey.

41:28.581 --> 41:29.385
Ah.

41:30.375 --> 41:32.305
You want to go for a walk?

41:34.165 --> 41:36.624
So, how was your day?

41:36.625 --> 41:39.454
Eh, uneventful.

41:39.455 --> 41:42.164
The good news is, I
think we finally have

41:42.165 --> 41:44.994
someone in Russia that
we can do business with.

41:44.995 --> 41:48.124
So that's worth something.

41:48.125 --> 41:50.385
That's worth a lot.

41:55.375 --> 41:58.204
I quit my job today.

41:58.205 --> 41:59.994
Not my-my job job.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.494
My other job.

42:01.495 --> 42:03.454
I guess I just needed some time

42:03.455 --> 42:07.624
to process... well, everything.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.994
If that's what you want, good.

42:09.995 --> 42:12.244
And just to be 100% clear,

42:12.245 --> 42:15.074
we do not need to be
talking to lawyers.

42:15.075 --> 42:17.555
You're not getting rid of me that easy.

42:19.705 --> 42:21.244
You're a good person, Elizabeth.

42:21.245 --> 42:22.954
I know you tried your best.

42:22.955 --> 42:24.334
So did I.

42:24.335 --> 42:27.074
But people still got hurt.

42:27.075 --> 42:29.175
Yeah.

42:31.875 --> 42:34.414
Maybe that should be my epitaph.

42:34.415 --> 42:36.414
"She tried her best,

42:36.415 --> 42:39.414
but people still got hurt."

42:39.415 --> 42:43.534
Not "She liked eating popcorn
at really weird times"?

42:43.535 --> 42:46.334
Okay, if I die first, I
want to make it that.

42:46.335 --> 42:48.845
Be... make sure that it's that.

42:51.575 --> 42:54.413
So now what?

42:54.414 --> 42:57.223
We just keep trying our best.
