WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.898
Previously on "Rescue Me"...

00:03.018 --> 00:05.496
You're going to eat your way right out
that door, Lou. Probably feet first.

00:05.616 --> 00:07.888
I just pray it happens before another
one of us ends up in a chair.

00:07.955 --> 00:08.889
Hey!

00:08.958 --> 00:11.391
That is your lieutenant
you are speaking to.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.786
- I earned my rank.
- You gotta keep earning it.

00:13.906 --> 00:16.565
I'm finished with my treatment.
They do some scans

00:16.633 --> 00:19.494
to find out if you're, you know,
free and clear.

00:19.614 --> 00:24.154
And I'm waiting for the results.
If they are not good, I have to start chemo

00:24.274 --> 00:26.448
all over again, which would suck.

00:26.735 --> 00:30.879
I want you to be the
godfather to my new kid.

00:30.948 --> 00:33.648
- I don't know what to say.
- Just say you'll go on a diet.

00:33.717 --> 00:35.950
If you won't do it for
yourself, do it for me.

00:36.019 --> 00:37.451
Can I have one last cupcake?

00:37.520 --> 00:42.154
I thought it would go great with this
double-tiered veil and these heels.

00:42.223 --> 00:45.324
Would you maybe want to help us
plan the rest of the wedding?

00:45.392 --> 00:47.160
- Uh, yeah.
- Really?!

00:47.228 --> 00:47.961
I'd be honored.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.931
Why don't you go
talk to her, dude?

00:50.999 --> 00:52.432
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:52.501 --> 00:53.100
How you doing?

00:53.168 --> 00:54.434
Can I help you with something?

00:54.503 --> 00:57.504
It's the new piece they're doing on Jimmy.
Relax. It's OK. This is a good thing.

00:57.573 --> 00:58.439
Get out!

00:58.507 --> 00:59.574
Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

00:59.643 --> 01:00.842
Hey, asshole!

01:00.911 --> 01:01.777
I'm the asshole?

01:01.845 --> 01:03.278
We should shoot this.

01:03.347 --> 01:06.414
They're doing like a 9/11 10th
anniversary special thing. Ok.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.216
Oh really?
What's their angle, huh, Franco?

01:08.285 --> 01:09.984
It is a hero piece.

01:10.053 --> 01:11.119
Just stick to the story.

01:11.187 --> 01:14.289
Jimmy was a hero. Jimmy. Jimmy--
I got it.

01:14.358 --> 01:19.160
So, you and Jimmy Keefe-- What
would have been a happy ending?

01:20.398 --> 01:22.169
There are no happy endings.

01:24.883 --> 01:29.695
Each one of these men gave their
lives in the line of duty that day.

01:29.815 --> 01:32.674
A day often referred
to as the single biggest

01:32.743 --> 01:35.443
enemy attack ever on American soil.

01:36.148 --> 01:38.979
But that's not how firefighter
Tommy Gavin sees it.

01:39.624 --> 01:47.856
You know, almost 3,000 people
died that day, including 343 of our guys.

01:48.794 --> 01:52.551
But it's also the
greatest rescue in the history

01:53.217 --> 01:55.811
the New York City Fire Department.

01:57.143 --> 02:00.971
Who knows how many lives we saved that day?

02:01.244 --> 02:06.016
15,000? 20--25,000? I mean, that morning
when it was happening,

02:06.652 --> 02:10.096
the first news reports we saying that
15,000 people working in there.

02:10.216 --> 02:14.008
So, I think, nobody
talks about that.

02:14.919 --> 02:19.453
Jimmy Keefe... according to all the
available evidence

02:20.452 --> 02:25.182
not only ran into the first tower to help,
but he escaped that building

02:25.984 --> 02:30.332
and ran into the second tower from
which he never returned.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.334
That's right.

02:33.213 --> 02:39.084
And, you know, that's why he's a
hero and that's why all those guys.

02:39.204 --> 02:44.314
They'll always be heroes to me. I mean,
biggest heroes in the history of this city.

02:45.361 --> 02:47.373
I mean, I'll always have
that--

02:48.417 --> 02:51.583
knowing that his last act on this earth was

02:52.975 --> 02:55.381
involved with
helping other people

02:56.834 --> 03:02.458
in a war really--in a war zone--
on the front line.

03:03.165 --> 03:06.448
There's another victim of 9/11
whose name is not on this wall...

03:06.516 --> 03:08.625
Well, so far so good.

03:08.745 --> 03:11.686
Yeah. Looks like she may
keep her word after all.

03:12.992 --> 03:17.759
...People who walk amongst us
and some who may never walk again.

03:18.001 --> 03:22.597
Young Damien Keefe followed his
father into the F.D.N.Y.

03:22.666 --> 03:26.576
coached by and ultimately assigned
to the same firehouse

03:26.696 --> 03:30.018
as his godfather and uncle Tommy Gavin.

03:30.442 --> 03:32.550
Do you blame yourself for
what happened to him?

03:34.578 --> 03:35.849
Yes, I do.

03:36.182 --> 03:40.825
Do you blame yourself for what happened
to his father, your cousin, Jimmy?

03:40.945 --> 03:42.550
No, I don't.

03:43.534 --> 03:46.888
What would you change about that day?

03:47.781 --> 03:54.691
If we could go back in time, what would be
a happy ending to that story?

03:55.997 --> 04:00.275
Well, we don't really spend a lot
of time

04:01.319 --> 04:04.728
thinking about it in those terms.
It was what it was.

04:04.848 --> 04:09.439
So, you know. Look, everybody dies.

04:10.845 --> 04:14.180
Some people die quick and easy,
some people die long and hard.

04:14.815 --> 04:19.968
Those guys died quick and hard,
which is not a great way to go. So...

04:23.766 --> 04:26.518
If you could change
what happened after that,

04:27.880 --> 04:30.770
after those
buildings came roaring down,

04:31.784 --> 04:36.799
after America and the world finally
came to see firefighters--

04:36.919 --> 04:39.606
and New York City fire
fighters in particular--

04:39.675 --> 04:47.381
as heroic, shining figures who leap to help
complete strangers in a time of need?

04:52.226 --> 04:54.996
What are you asking me? What?

04:57.529 --> 04:59.148
What?

04:59.285 --> 05:00.480
Sorry.

05:00.889 --> 05:02.074
You agreed to--

05:02.194 --> 05:05.070
I know. I know. I agreed
to talk about my cousin.

05:06.124 --> 05:08.666
I'm just asking you how you
feel about the attention--

05:08.786 --> 05:13.191
I know. I know. We appreciate the attention.
But, you know, we don't--

05:13.766 --> 05:16.202
We just want to do our job.
That's what we did that day.

05:16.322 --> 05:19.127
You know what I mean?
We don't need no spotlight.

05:19.247 --> 05:24.614
We just--we're not heroes.
We're just doing our job just like we were

05:25.567 --> 05:27.387
the day before 9/11.
You know what I mean.

05:27.456 --> 05:31.989
You know, the day before 9/11
we got paid...

05:32.109 --> 05:34.117
And here we go.
...And we get the same now.

05:34.237 --> 05:35.662
So, whatever.
You know, what I mean?

05:35.731 --> 05:38.085
You seem upset about that.

05:39.528 --> 05:42.047
I'm not upset about it.
You just asked me a question.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.890
I'm just answering the question. You know
what I mean?

05:44.010 --> 05:47.098
Just back off a little bit. That's all.

05:47.892 --> 05:51.844
We do what we do.
If there's a disaster, we respond.

05:51.913 --> 05:56.679
Let me ask you this. There's been
a lot of controversy since 9/11

05:57.012 --> 05:58.864
involving the F.D.N.Y.--

06:00.074 --> 06:02.660
- alcohol and drug abuse.
- Uh-huh.

06:03.417 --> 06:06.788
Allegations of racism in the
department's hiring practices,

06:06.831 --> 06:09.862
allegations of sexism.
That the department is nothing

06:09.931 --> 06:11.731
but a big boys club run amuck.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.264
OK. You know what?
As far as the racism thing goes, I really...

06:15.869 --> 06:17.670
That's not what I agreed
to talk about here.

06:17.739 --> 06:22.739
But you know, as long as you bring it up--
this is not--that's no racism here.

06:22.859 --> 06:25.845
I--you know, we got
a black guy on our crew.

06:25.913 --> 06:29.639
You got a Puerto Rican guy in our crew.
Nobody gives a [bleep] about--

06:29.759 --> 06:31.317
you know, as long as they can do
the job--

06:31.386 --> 06:34.520
you think Jimmy Keefe and those guys
pulled up the morning of 9/11

06:34.589 --> 06:38.312
and ran into the lobby and said,
"Which floors are the white people on?" No!

06:38.432 --> 06:40.960
We don't know, but if you check,
I'm sure you can find out.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.062
Out of the 3,000 that died,
how many were black?

06:43.130 --> 06:46.094
They didn't give a
who was black or not.

06:46.214 --> 06:48.167
They just went in and
did the [bleep] job.

06:48.287 --> 06:51.498
Let's stay on target here.

06:51.618 --> 07:00.204
I am just trying to explain to you.
You know-- you gotta black president now.

07:00.324 --> 07:03.205
Everybody did a big happy dance
when he got elected.

07:03.325 --> 07:06.154
I'm just going to tell you the truth. If
Barack Obama wanted to become a firefighter

07:06.274 --> 07:08.091
he's gotta take
the same [bleep] test

07:08.211 --> 07:10.361
that I took, that all these guys took. OK?

07:10.382 --> 07:13.285
Nobody gives a [bleep] what color they are
as long as they're made out of steel!

07:13.334 --> 07:16.931
That's the truth. And I'll tell you something
else, I'm sick and tired of hearing

07:17.051 --> 07:19.848
people talk
about us like we're glorified garbage men.

07:19.968 --> 07:20.524
But you know what?

07:20.644 --> 07:23.635
Next time your house catches on
fire or somebody in your family

07:23.755 --> 07:25.557
gets hurt or whatever, you know what?
Instead of calling us,

07:25.677 --> 07:29.383
call the the [bleep] garbage truck.
I'm done! [Bleep] you!

07:29.503 --> 07:31.945
you! [Bleep] you!

07:32.726 --> 07:35.828
So, it seems the pain of 9/11
still runs deep.

07:36.852 --> 07:41.368
Perhaps it's men like firefighter Thomas
Gavin who need more than ever

07:41.488 --> 07:45.667
the psychological help many men
in the department refuse seek.

07:46.651 --> 07:49.862
Reporting from ground
zero, I'm Pam Kepler.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.049
Jesus Christ, Lou, I thought
you said you had a friend down

07:54.117 --> 07:56.619
at the TV station who was going to put
all that bad shit Tommy said to bed?

07:56.739 --> 07:58.737
Yeah. I talked to her and she
said she would do what she could.

07:58.857 --> 08:00.911
She would--that was her doing
what she could do?!

08:01.031 --> 08:02.523
Well, whoopedy do! Great job, Lou!

08:02.825 --> 08:05.943
And it doesn't even matter if it's
true, Tommy. It's bullshit! OK.

08:06.063 --> 08:08.151
Just when the spotlight gets
taken off this house!

08:08.271 --> 08:10.681
You know that spotlight that always seems
to be pointed in our general direction

08:10.801 --> 08:13.644
for all the wrong reasons.
Usually because of your stupid ass antics!

08:13.764 --> 08:15.939
Here we go again!
Great job, man!

08:16.007 --> 08:17.107
All right, just calm down!

08:17.175 --> 08:19.309
No! No! No! You calm down, chief!
You're the one who pulled the news chick aside

08:19.377 --> 08:20.378
after Tommy went nuts.

08:20.498 --> 08:23.346
Said you were going to charm here into
not including that part of the interview.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.681
I'm gonna turn on my Guinea charm.
I mean,

08:25.750 --> 08:27.617
where the hell do you keep this
Guinea charm you keep talking about?

08:27.685 --> 08:30.153
- Up you're Guinea ass?
- Hey! Hey!

08:30.222 --> 08:31.754
Aah!

08:31.823 --> 08:32.989
Hey! Hey!

08:33.057 --> 08:35.291
Goddamnit!

08:35.360 --> 08:37.493
Shut your goddamn mouth!

08:37.562 --> 08:38.327
Hey!

08:38.395 --> 08:40.363
Who's phone is that? Jesus Christ.

08:41.558 --> 08:43.366
Answer it.

08:43.434 --> 08:44.434
Hey.

08:44.884 --> 08:47.638
Yeah. We just saw it. I gotta run.
I can't talk right now.

08:47.758 --> 08:50.498
What the hell's going on?
The phone's ringing off the hook out front.

08:50.740 --> 08:51.964
Headquarters wants
to talk to you, chief.

08:52.084 --> 08:53.023
I will be right there.

08:53.143 --> 08:56.947
Your bullshit stops now. Here and now.
You talk about the shit you see.

08:57.015 --> 08:59.331
There's a lot of shit
you don't see, you don't know,

08:59.451 --> 09:01.985
and you don't do. You talk the talk
and you don't walk the walk.

09:02.053 --> 09:04.472
And it ends now!
You understand me, pretty boy?

09:04.592 --> 09:05.486
Chief, phone.

09:05.606 --> 09:07.589
Shut your mouth!
You understand me?!

09:07.709 --> 09:08.909
Yes, sir.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.994
Walk it off.

09:12.114 --> 09:14.630
Jesus Christ.

09:14.699 --> 09:16.332
Thanks a shitload, Tommy G.

09:16.401 --> 09:17.553
Yeah, I did it. I did it.

09:17.673 --> 09:19.802
You just got me in a fist fight
with a commanding officer.

09:19.871 --> 09:21.504
Appreciate that, brother.

09:21.573 --> 09:23.006
- All my fault.
- Yeah. It is all your fault.

09:23.074 --> 09:24.874
You know, I'll tell you what guys.
You think that's the last

09:24.943 --> 09:26.776
we're going to see of that news
footage, you got something else coming.

09:26.845 --> 09:28.650
That's going to be on
every major news network.

09:28.770 --> 09:31.247
It's going to be on the Internet.
All over the goddamn planet in minutes.

09:31.316 --> 09:32.649
Probably already is.

09:32.717 --> 09:34.387
So, what's the countdown, huh Tommy?
Huh?

09:34.507 --> 09:36.253
How long before the rest of the world
descends on this house

09:36.373 --> 09:38.160
like a pack of flies and starts digging
for more shit?!

09:38.280 --> 09:39.719
What are you worried
about, Franco?

09:39.839 --> 09:41.272
What kind of shit am I worried about?
You know what?

09:41.392 --> 09:43.996
That's a good goddamn question, Tom.
Where should we start? Huh?

09:44.116 --> 09:46.600
Maybe the banging your dead
hero cousin's wife shit?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.332
That's always a good jumping off point.

09:48.401 --> 09:50.077
The drug shit? The booze shit?

09:50.197 --> 09:54.004
Go ahead. Go on national TV,
shit all over us! All over all of us!

09:54.073 --> 09:56.173
Yeah, just like you
shit on the 343.

09:56.242 --> 09:56.874
What?!

09:56.943 --> 09:57.845
Is that what you're worried about?
That they're going to find out

09:57.895 --> 10:00.207
about you're little conspiracy--
Oh, Jesus Christ!

10:00.327 --> 10:02.428
No, no, no. Let me guess.
I think I got it. You're worried

10:02.548 --> 10:04.511
that they're going to find out
that you tried to bang my wife.

10:08.254 --> 10:10.488
Hey! Come on guys! Come on!

10:10.557 --> 10:12.090
Get off me, man!

10:12.159 --> 10:13.091
Break it up!

10:13.160 --> 10:16.461
Get off me!

10:16.581 --> 10:18.496
I'm good! I'm good!

10:18.565 --> 10:20.547
You know what, asshole?
I am done!

10:20.667 --> 10:21.334
Tommy!

10:21.454 --> 10:25.303
Done! You guys want to hitch your careers
and your reputations to Tommy's rebel

10:25.372 --> 10:28.678
asshole parade, by all means, be my guest.
I got bigger things in mind.

10:28.798 --> 10:32.059
And I'll tell you what, Lou, if I had a white
or a blue shirt on with stripes on my arm,

10:32.179 --> 10:34.700
I bet you I could do a better job of keeping
something like this under the carpet.

10:34.973 --> 10:36.943
Keeping some loose canon prick in line.

10:37.063 --> 10:38.320
Yeah, right.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.514
Yeah, right.

Why don't you get that, Tom?

it's probably for you.

Hey, what you doing?

11:44.146 --> 11:46.654
I'm reading a couple of cookbooks.

11:46.685 --> 11:50.855
Figure in case you and I both get fired
because of this latest incident,

11:50.889 --> 11:54.579
I can get work as a sous-chef.
And by sous I mean I'm willing

11:54.648 --> 11:57.783
to fry scallops or work in a casino.

Hey.

What a thick bitch!

12:09.997 --> 12:11.062
So, you guys saw it?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.564
Yeah. Did you see how
much make up she had on?

12:13.633 --> 12:14.365
Right?

12:14.434 --> 12:17.167
I really want to kick
her in the goddamn box.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.302
Listen, I'm sorry.

12:18.370 --> 12:21.138
No. Don't say sorry.
Listen, I was the one that

12:21.206 --> 12:24.207
wanted everyone to remember Jimmy.
And well, guess what?

12:24.276 --> 12:26.447
- They're all going to remember him now.
- I know.

12:26.567 --> 12:27.712
Hey. Did the kids see it?

12:27.780 --> 12:30.348
Yeah. You were great, dad.
It was so exciting.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.814
Geez. How many phones you
guys got in that place?

12:32.934 --> 12:33.585
3.

12:33.654 --> 12:35.954
4. Dad, what you said was right.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.890
I thought that you
were watching Wyatt?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.058
No, I'm watching Wyatt.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.114
Yeah? What did he think?

He pissed himself.

12:42.716 --> 12:43.596
Katy?!

12:43.664 --> 12:44.696
Well, he did.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.962
Listen, Tommy, can you pick up a
few things on your way over here?

12:48.082 --> 12:49.100
What do you need?

12:49.168 --> 12:50.701
Do you have a pen and a
really big piece of paper?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.938
Ahh. You know, somebody else is calling.

12:54.058 --> 12:56.479
Call back and leave
a list on my voicemail, OK?

12:56.888 --> 12:58.194
OK.

12:59.711 --> 13:00.810
Kelly, what's up?

13:00.879 --> 13:03.513
You were really cute on TV.

13:03.581 --> 13:07.417
I don't think cute is the word they people
down at headquarters are going to be using.

13:07.485 --> 13:10.220
That chick was supposed
to run all, you know,

13:10.288 --> 13:13.355
positive stuff I said about Jimmy.
She wasn't supposed

13:13.475 --> 13:15.091
to run the stuff where I blew up, you
know what I mean?

13:15.160 --> 13:16.559
Well, you're my hero.

13:16.628 --> 13:17.494
Why?

13:17.562 --> 13:19.930
Because you gave the finger
on television

13:19.999 --> 13:24.481
in front of Pam Kepler. That moron makes
Sarah Palin look like Madeleine Albright.

13:24.601 --> 13:27.004
- Hey, how did your thing go?
- Still waiting.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.207
So, do you want me to come over?

13:29.276 --> 13:31.509
Yeah. I want you to come over.

13:31.578 --> 13:36.351
I can't do it right now. I--
I was being sarcastic.

13:37.819 --> 13:39.878
But you should definitely
call me later.

13:41.990 --> 13:44.190
Does that mean I shouldn't
call you later?

13:44.687 --> 13:48.762
You should really,
actually call me later.

13:49.717 --> 13:51.497
OK.

13:51.566 --> 13:54.000
She's so funny.

13:54.069 --> 13:58.438
Would that be Kelly with the
filthy mouth and the beautiful

13:58.507 --> 14:00.273
smile from last year.

14:00.342 --> 14:05.545
OK. It's not what you think, first of all.
OK. And second of all, it's not

14:05.833 --> 14:08.527
even what you think
it was when you thought it was

14:08.647 --> 14:12.083
- whatever you thought it was--
- I'll tell you what I think.

14:12.152 --> 14:16.579
Your wife has a vagina.
Sheila has a vagina.

14:16.699 --> 14:20.457
Kelly has a vagina.
Your daughters have vaginas.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.693
Tommy, you're surrounded
by vaginas on all sides, which is

14:23.762 --> 14:25.529
probably the reason why I
believe you've grown

14:25.598 --> 14:28.333
one all your own. Because you're no
longer thinking with your cock.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.801
You're thinking with your vag.

14:29.870 --> 14:33.172
It's the only reason that makes sense.
Because otherwise

14:33.240 --> 14:36.075
you'd be banging beautiful Ms. Kelly
instead of heading into

14:36.144 --> 14:38.878
another one of these emotional affairs
with her just like last year.

14:38.947 --> 14:41.481
She has cancer.

14:42.218 --> 14:46.364
She has cancer. You have kids
with another kid on the way.

14:48.389 --> 14:52.154
Jesus Christ. The "Celery Bible", Tom.

14:52.245 --> 14:54.479
"Yogurt and appreciation."

14:54.599 --> 14:59.890
I am trying to
uphold my half of the godfather bargain.

15:00.698 --> 15:02.632
You should do the same.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.230
Don't ever go against the family, Tom.

15:08.145 --> 15:09.122
And one more thing.

15:10.343 --> 15:14.942
Tatalia's a pimp.
I never knew until just now.

15:16.153 --> 15:18.275
It was Barzini all along.

15:19.118 --> 15:25.121
240, 260, 280, 300.

15:26.427 --> 15:29.558
I'll get you a copy of the contract.
You're going to have

15:29.627 --> 15:35.355
such a lovely ceremony.
And your fiancee will be very happy.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.704
You know, Mike, I hope you're
right about this thing, man.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.473
I mean, 300 bones, non-refundable?

15:42.542 --> 15:43.808
That ain't chump change, son.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.476
Trust me, bro.
She's going to love it.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.844
She doesn't like--
Hey!

15:46.913 --> 15:48.346
Shh!

15:48.415 --> 15:51.349
Hey. Nice digs.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.621
This is gorgeous.

15:53.985 --> 15:55.620
You really like it?

15:55.689 --> 15:56.588
I love it.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.538
Ha ha!

15:59.658 --> 16:00.959
Aah!

16:01.028 --> 16:02.928
So, where are we going
to put the pipers?

16:02.997 --> 16:05.931
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No pipers, all right.
We're going to do a DJ thing.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.201
No, no, no. I was thinking
more of a string quartet.

16:09.270 --> 16:10.970
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

16:11.039 --> 16:13.472
Look. Do whatever you want as
long as there's some bagpipers

16:13.541 --> 16:15.441
playing "Here Comes the Bride."

16:15.510 --> 16:18.010
It's a Gavin family tradition.
No pipers, no wedding.

16:18.079 --> 16:21.114
- Here's your copy.
- Thank you.

16:21.182 --> 16:22.848
Well, aren't you a lovely girl?

16:22.968 --> 16:24.183
Thank you, you're so sweet.

16:24.252 --> 16:26.919
Babe, this is Ms. Martha.
This is her place.

16:26.988 --> 16:30.290
Your place is beautiful.
I'm Colleen, the bride-to-be.

16:30.359 --> 16:33.893
Ohh. Did I hear someone
mention bagpipes?

16:33.962 --> 16:35.595
Yes, you most certainly did!

16:35.664 --> 16:37.687
So, you're Scottish, I presume?

16:37.807 --> 16:40.099
No, baby.
We're Irish head to toe.

16:40.168 --> 16:44.305
Oh, Irish is it. That's nice.
Very nice.

16:44.373 --> 16:45.372
You gotta go.

16:45.441 --> 16:47.581
- What?
- Get out. Out. Everybody out!

16:47.701 --> 16:48.977
- Why?
- Out!

16:49.045 --> 16:50.812
What a minute?
What are you talking about?

16:50.880 --> 16:51.646
You come here.

16:51.715 --> 16:54.349
- I am ashamed of you!
- Excuse me?

16:54.418 --> 16:57.504
There's no way you are marrying
this girl in my place.

16:58.820 --> 17:00.156
You're not serious.

17:00.225 --> 17:01.858
I'm Malcolm X serious.

17:01.926 --> 17:03.659
This is discrimination, lady.

17:03.728 --> 17:05.228
You can't kick us out
because we're white.

17:05.297 --> 17:06.575
I ain't kicking you out
because you're white.

17:06.694 --> 17:10.132
I'm kicking you out because you're
green as in the emerald isle.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.133
Hey, that's reverse racism.

17:12.202 --> 17:14.102
No. That's forwards racism.

17:14.171 --> 17:16.471
And I'm steering it
straight at you.

17:16.539 --> 17:17.872
You watch that stuff, lady.

17:17.941 --> 17:21.137
My people have been suffering
this shit for far too long.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.210
You more than anyone should
understand that.

17:23.278 --> 17:26.025
You better get out of my face, fat ass.

17:26.145 --> 17:30.383
This place means too much to me to have
another McGuire incident.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.788
You're not talking about the
Michael McGuire wedding, are you?

17:34.857 --> 17:36.890
You bet your big pink face I am.

17:36.959 --> 17:39.757
Oh, boy. I heard about that one.

17:39.877 --> 17:42.749
I think my Uncle Denny was
actually there. Lost a finger.

17:42.869 --> 17:44.456
Who are the McGuires?

17:45.500 --> 17:49.403
Real shanty Irish.
Make the Gavins look like Amish people.

17:49.471 --> 17:53.073
Drink like fish.
Marlin size fish!

17:53.786 --> 17:58.077
Ms. Martha, I apologize.

17:58.146 --> 18:00.246
Let's go guys.

18:00.315 --> 18:05.151
Hey, wait a minute. This is not fair.
What about my deposit?

18:05.220 --> 18:07.821
- How much did you pay her?
- 300 bucks.

18:07.889 --> 18:11.225
Oh, come on. What are you doing?

18:11.293 --> 18:13.661
Here's 4. Reparations, kid.

18:13.730 --> 18:15.964
Reparations!

18:23.101 --> 18:25.173
- So, that went well.
- Better than well.

18:25.242 --> 18:27.008
- Yeah, it did, right?
- Totally.

18:27.077 --> 18:29.640
Good. I'm not just drunk.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.455
No. We're both pretty drunk.

18:31.575 --> 18:34.748
But you're still right.
It still went well.

18:34.817 --> 18:37.117
Good. Usually I'm a little
bit of a mess

18:37.185 --> 18:39.686
in these situations. But tonight I
felt a little, I don't know.

18:39.754 --> 18:40.720
Easy.

18:40.789 --> 18:44.892
Yeah. Easy, right. Easy rider easy.
Easy bake oven easy.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.795
You know? Easy...I'm blowing it.

18:47.864 --> 18:49.397
We're fine.

18:49.466 --> 18:51.066
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:51.134 --> 18:53.202
So, it's OK that I'm
psyched about this?

18:53.270 --> 18:54.603
Yeah.

18:54.672 --> 18:56.406
I'm psyched you're psyched.

18:56.474 --> 18:59.409
I'm definitely psyched.

19:11.924 --> 19:14.892
Yes! All right, we're
definitely doing this again.

19:14.961 --> 19:16.061
Yeah. No argument there.

19:16.129 --> 19:17.095
Let's get you a taxi.

19:21.501 --> 19:23.001
Thank you.

19:25.705 --> 19:31.157
All right, so I'm going to call you. OK?

19:31.277 --> 19:36.045
So we can--
9th and A, step on it.

20:47.148 --> 20:48.449
Hey, where are you?

20:48.569 --> 20:49.636
I'm home.

20:49.756 --> 20:51.171
Oh, can you not talk?

20:51.286 --> 20:53.454
Yeah. I can talk. There's nobody here.
They're all over at

20:53.523 --> 20:57.196
Sheila's. So, what's going on?

20:57.853 --> 21:00.862
It's good. I'm all done.

21:00.930 --> 21:01.962
Seriously?

21:02.031 --> 21:04.531
Yeah, seriously. What do you think?
I'm busting your balls?

21:04.600 --> 21:06.367
Are you kidding me? I'm done.

21:06.436 --> 21:07.635
Shit. Wow.

21:07.703 --> 21:08.536
Why don't you come over?

21:08.604 --> 21:11.198
Oh all right. You need anything?

21:11.318 --> 21:15.041
Yes. Some milk and some
butter and some eggs.

21:15.110 --> 21:16.742
That's funny.

21:16.811 --> 21:19.178
Milk, butter, eggs. Goodbye.

21:20.169 --> 21:24.316
Jesus.
You never know with that broad.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.613
Hey! What's up, bro?

21:55.682 --> 21:57.048
Yo.
How you doing?

21:57.117 --> 21:58.416
All right.
Thanks for meeting me here.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.888
Hey, I'll have what he's having.

22:00.008 --> 22:02.520
Thanks.
All right, I got problems.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.956
Better not be your
cock again, dude.

22:05.025 --> 22:07.052
No. It's not my cock.
Oh, Jesus I hope it's not.

22:07.172 --> 22:08.660
All right, well spit it out.

22:08.729 --> 22:12.106
All right, remember Emily from
the dress shop? Super hot chick?

22:12.226 --> 22:14.734
We had the most amazing
date ever last night.

22:14.803 --> 22:15.468
And?

22:15.537 --> 22:18.371
And we get back to her place,
and I'm telling you, bro,

22:18.440 --> 22:22.137
I had the best sex I've ever
had in my entire life. OK.

22:22.257 --> 22:26.246
I mean, it was like intergalactic,
Avatar-caliber sex. OK. I mean,

22:26.315 --> 22:28.548
I blew fireworks all over the wall.
Practically burned the

22:28.617 --> 22:30.254
place down. It was that good.

22:31.510 --> 22:32.885
And?

22:33.005 --> 22:35.755
And, all right. Afterwards,
we're just laying there

22:35.824 --> 22:38.245
basking in the afterglow or whatever.

22:38.365 --> 22:43.288
When out of nowhere, all of a
sudden the entire place reeks.

22:43.408 --> 22:45.048
Bro, I'm telling you it reeks.

22:45.168 --> 22:48.503
It reeks like a sewer in a bad
neighborhood where people

22:48.572 --> 22:51.789
only eat Indian food. That's how bad it was.
I mean, I can still taste it.

22:52.609 --> 22:53.775
Now we're talking.

22:53.843 --> 22:54.976
See what I'm saying?

22:55.045 --> 22:57.787
- All right...
- What do you got?

22:57.907 --> 23:02.953
Well, there can only be a few
possible explanations for this.

23:04.755 --> 23:08.724
And the first thing that comes
to my mind is her vagina.

23:08.844 --> 23:11.359
- Was it like rank, dude?
- No.

23:11.428 --> 23:12.811
No, no, no. Because that
happens to chicks, bro.

23:12.931 --> 23:14.596
That's why they invented the
douche, you know?

23:14.665 --> 23:16.559
I thought they invented that so
we'd have something to call you.

23:16.679 --> 23:19.501
Ha, very funny.
Then figure it out yourself.

23:19.570 --> 23:21.136
No, I'm sorry. I'm just kidding.
It's not her vagina, alright?

23:21.205 --> 23:23.146
I got plenty of
experience with rank vagina, OK.

23:23.266 --> 23:24.173
Hi.

23:24.242 --> 23:25.808
Oh that's right.
You were married to Maggie.

23:25.877 --> 23:27.643
Yeah, no surprisingly that
wasn't one of her issues

23:27.712 --> 23:29.286
actually. But could you stop
bringing it up, please?

23:29.406 --> 23:30.446
How many times I gotta ask you?

23:30.515 --> 23:32.515
- Sore subject?
- Yeah.

23:32.583 --> 23:33.747
That's exactly why I
brought it up, dude.

23:33.867 --> 23:36.085
OK. Hardy har har. Touche.

23:36.153 --> 23:38.254
Or should I say, douche.

23:38.322 --> 23:41.059
Hey, don't say it to me. Say it
to your girlfriend and her stink box, bro.

23:41.179 --> 23:43.902
Hey, bro, I'm telling you.
It is not her vagina. OK.

23:44.022 --> 23:51.003
This odor has more of like an ass essence
to it, you know. An assence if you will.

23:52.804 --> 23:53.769
Was it you?

23:53.838 --> 23:56.873
No, bro. No way. Not a chance.
First, I never fart

23:56.941 --> 23:59.356
with a new chick until like the
4th date--3rd date maybe.

23:59.476 --> 24:02.678
Second off, I have never in my life
farted the smell of

24:02.747 --> 24:05.080
a rotting corpse, bro. I'm telling you I
would have to eat

24:05.149 --> 24:09.150
a dead guy who just ate Indian food and
then shit his pants in order to fart

24:09.219 --> 24:11.214
a smell that bad.
That's how bad it was.

24:12.355 --> 24:18.158
Whoa. Uh, OK.
Um, does she have a dog?

24:18.227 --> 24:21.595
Yeah. Little dog.
He watched the whole-- the dog!

24:21.663 --> 24:24.097
Yes. Mystery solved.

24:24.166 --> 24:26.601
He's just tiny though. They're this big.
There's no way he could create a stink

24:26.669 --> 24:27.936
that colossal. I'm telling you, bro.

24:28.004 --> 24:28.937
It wouldn't work.

24:29.006 --> 24:31.228
No, no, no. Dude.
It was definitely the dog.

24:31.334 --> 24:34.243
Listen, from the way you described the sex,
it sounds like you traumatized

24:34.312 --> 24:36.713
the crap out of that little son
of a bitch, bro.

24:36.940 --> 24:39.749
Listen, don't sweat it. You're just waiting
for the other shoe

24:39.818 --> 24:44.722
to drop because you guys hit it off so well.
Just enjoy yourself. You know?

24:44.791 --> 24:46.924
- Yeah. Maybe it was the dog.
- Yeah.

24:46.993 --> 24:48.192
Yeah, it was totally the dog.

24:48.261 --> 24:50.595
- Come on, dude.
- Thanks, bro.

24:50.664 --> 24:51.329
No problem, bro.

24:51.398 --> 24:53.865
All right, drinks are on this guy.
OK? See ya.

24:53.933 --> 24:55.433
What?

25:03.986 --> 25:05.020
Hello?

25:05.089 --> 25:06.526
I'm in the kitchen.

25:06.646 --> 25:08.336
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:08.405 --> 25:09.371
What's going on?

25:09.440 --> 25:11.095
Nothing.

25:12.490 --> 25:18.547
What-- I thought you only used a
stove as a place to hide stuff in.

25:18.616 --> 25:22.584
Yeah. And as a giant cigarette lighter.
Perfect.

25:22.653 --> 25:25.620
I used up all my friends' stuff,
so I wanted to make sure I

25:25.688 --> 25:27.455
replaced it. Are you hungry?

25:27.523 --> 25:28.689
I could eat.

25:28.758 --> 25:30.357
Well, you don't want to
eat what I'm cooking.

25:30.426 --> 25:32.559
- What are you cooking?
- Brownies.

25:32.628 --> 25:34.661
Huge brownie fan.

25:34.729 --> 25:36.796
You don't want to eat these
brownies I'm cooking.

25:36.864 --> 25:38.326
Why? What are you cooking?

25:38.446 --> 25:40.600
They have about an ounce of weed in them.
I'm leaving 'em

25:40.668 --> 25:42.668
for my friend as a thank you for
letting me stay here. But I

25:42.737 --> 25:44.363
could make you a ham
and vicadin sandwich.

25:47.709 --> 25:48.808
Tommy.

25:48.876 --> 25:51.944
I don't know--do I say
"congratulations?"

25:52.013 --> 25:56.917
Yeah. You won. That's what my doctor told me.
Let me get a vase.

25:57.871 --> 26:00.125
That's...great.

26:00.245 --> 26:01.086
I know.

26:01.155 --> 26:03.922
I'm really happy.

26:04.732 --> 26:07.199
I don't know. "Happy" is like a dumbass word.
I'm not happy.

26:07.319 --> 26:10.628
But I am happy.
But I don't know what I am.

26:10.697 --> 26:12.858
Relieved.

26:12.978 --> 26:17.875
Yes. I'm relieved. How are you?

26:18.471 --> 26:20.972
I'm, you know, fine.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.074
Which means?

26:23.143 --> 26:25.343
I suck.

26:25.412 --> 26:27.413
Oh. Suck how bad?

26:27.482 --> 26:30.547
Surrounded by estrogen bad.
My daughter's getting married,

26:30.577 --> 26:32.121
so you can imagine.

26:32.241 --> 26:34.542
Oh, suck city. To who?

26:34.662 --> 26:36.064
To this guy I work with.

26:36.184 --> 26:38.358
Ooh, boy. Which one?

26:38.427 --> 26:40.961
The little black guy.
I don't know if you remember him.

26:41.029 --> 26:42.316
Yeah. He's cute.
Do you like him?

26:44.233 --> 26:47.500
He's having sex with my daughter.

26:48.170 --> 26:51.237
Yeah, but not for much longer.
They're getting married.

26:52.117 --> 26:54.307
I mean, they'll pump out a
couple of mullato babies and

26:54.375 --> 26:57.195
pretty soon sex will just be something
each of them wants to do with somebody else.

26:58.613 --> 27:04.551
I never thought of it that way.
I feel way less sucky.

27:05.467 --> 27:07.238
And you don't have cancer.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.558
And neither do I anymore.

27:11.328 --> 27:12.727
- Shit!
- What?

27:14.829 --> 27:18.190
I'm so relieved for you.

27:18.310 --> 27:21.269
- Shit! Goddamnit!
- What?

27:21.338 --> 27:22.938
Goddamnit! Son of a bitch!

27:24.551 --> 27:28.744
Jesus! Hey! What the hell!

27:28.813 --> 27:31.013
Burned the brownies!

27:31.082 --> 27:35.718
OK. I mean, do you got
more brownie stuff?

27:35.786 --> 27:39.188
It's not about the
brownies you asshole!

27:39.256 --> 27:42.324
Well...What?

27:42.392 --> 27:44.493
I don't know!

27:44.562 --> 27:50.708
Well, OK. Uh, your doctor said--

27:50.828 --> 27:53.034
I know what the goddamn doctor said.

27:53.154 --> 27:57.331
The doctor said, "you won."
But I don't feel like I won anything!

28:01.513 --> 28:03.212
All right, just go ahead.
Get it all out.

28:03.281 --> 28:04.014
Shut up!

28:04.082 --> 28:06.884
Just shut up!

28:06.952 --> 28:08.219
Shut up!

28:11.018 --> 28:13.391
I'm sorry!

28:17.764 --> 28:24.508
I'm sorry. I was going to be this kick
ass cancer patient, you know.

28:24.628 --> 28:25.919
And I was.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.872
I believe you.

28:28.601 --> 28:31.627
And I did everything they told me to do.
Everyday

28:32.308 --> 28:35.229
you sort of focus one inch in front of you.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.814
And I lived that way for months.

28:38.934 --> 28:43.429
And I lost my hair and
my eyebrows and my eyelashes and my looks.

28:43.549 --> 28:47.927
And then this
guy--this doctor--says, "all right

28:48.047 --> 28:51.503
you're good to go. You're all set."
What am I supposed to do?!

28:51.790 --> 28:57.329
Find the secret of life?
Go to India? Find Jesus? I just--

29:10.199 --> 29:12.030
Hello?

29:12.953 --> 29:15.055
Kel?

29:21.330 --> 29:22.964
Hey.

29:23.033 --> 29:26.195
I wish I had a real
boyfriend to do this with.

29:26.846 --> 29:30.573
Um, you OK?

29:30.642 --> 29:31.808
Don't touch me.

29:31.876 --> 29:34.244
OK. Got it.

29:45.424 --> 29:46.824
OK. Now you can touch me.

29:46.892 --> 29:48.759
OK.

29:51.764 --> 29:53.930
Here you go.

29:58.003 --> 29:59.770
You all right?

30:10.415 --> 30:11.931
OK.

30:13.581 --> 30:15.885
I'm just--I don't know.
I mean...

30:18.435 --> 30:19.572
What?

30:19.692 --> 30:22.125
What if I'm still just...

30:25.431 --> 30:27.297
Shallow?

30:31.837 --> 30:36.774
I'll tell you something.
This whole time you were you know

30:36.842 --> 30:43.414
talking about your eyebrows and your
hair and you know, I'll tell you

30:43.483 --> 30:45.882
what I was doing--
what I was thinking about.

30:46.972 --> 30:51.814
About not getting hit with a plate.

30:51.934 --> 31:00.419
But also, you know, your
eyes and your ass.

31:25.647 --> 31:28.125
Did that make you feel better?

31:32.297 --> 31:34.130
No.

31:34.199 --> 31:38.202
I mean, a little bit.
But I mean, do you think your kisses

31:38.271 --> 31:40.404
work some sort of magic on women?

31:40.473 --> 31:42.508
It was nice.

31:44.143 --> 31:49.022
Not like George Clooney waltzed in here.

31:49.306 --> 31:51.929
But it was good.

31:54.052 --> 31:56.334
This is good. It helped me...

32:00.662 --> 32:01.827
focus.

32:03.982 --> 32:05.134
It helped me focus.

32:05.254 --> 32:07.131
Because I don't want to spend
the next 10 years

32:07.200 --> 32:11.335
just twisting in the wind trying to
figure out all of this,

32:11.404 --> 32:13.604
you know, anger or grief.

32:13.672 --> 32:15.971
I don't want to be you.

32:18.059 --> 32:19.103
What?

32:19.223 --> 32:21.698
All this stuff you're talking about.
I mean,

32:21.818 --> 32:25.951
all this stuff about God and ghosts and
all of it--it doesn't make a difference.

32:26.020 --> 32:29.623
The women and the booze.
You just have to go home

32:31.192 --> 32:32.659
and kiss your wife the way you kiss me.

32:33.400 --> 32:38.257
That might work a little magic.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.437
So, you want me to leave?

32:44.641 --> 32:45.973
Yeah.

32:47.062 --> 32:51.610
All right. Got it. OK.

32:55.949 --> 32:57.128
Bye.

33:18.429 --> 33:19.747
Hey, chief.

33:19.867 --> 33:20.828
Rivera, hey.

33:20.897 --> 33:22.312
Thanks for meeting me off campus.
I appreciate it.

33:22.432 --> 33:23.367
It's all right.

33:23.487 --> 33:25.099
So, what's the story?

33:25.167 --> 33:29.036
Well, chief, to be honest, I was
hoping for a little guidance.

33:29.104 --> 33:31.571
You know what happened the last time
I tried to coach one of you guys?

33:31.640 --> 33:33.774
Well, yeah. But this ain't about Damien.
And I'm not cashing out.

33:33.843 --> 33:36.364
Don't worry about that.
But listen, chief, I've been thinking.

33:37.594 --> 33:40.415
I want to be a leader.
I want to be a lieutenant.

33:40.484 --> 33:42.051
You have my full support.

33:42.936 --> 33:47.824
Well, you know, I appreciate that.
I was kind of hoping for

33:47.893 --> 33:50.193
maybe a little something extra,
if you know what I mean.

33:50.262 --> 33:56.348
Tell you what I'll do. You ace that test.
I'll call downtown make sure

33:56.468 --> 33:59.569
you're assigned to a top house in the city.
No problem.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.772
Chief, that's just what I was hoping for.
Thank you so much.

34:02.840 --> 34:03.572
No problem.

34:03.641 --> 34:06.138
Keep your nose clean and your
mouth shut till it happens.

34:06.258 --> 34:07.721
Hey, nose clean, mouth shut.

34:07.841 --> 34:09.416
No problem. Right. Yes!

34:48.605 --> 34:49.922
That was amazing.

34:50.042 --> 34:52.792
Yeah. God, totally. Mmm.

35:04.606 --> 35:05.772
Where's your dog?

35:05.841 --> 35:08.942
My sister took him so we could
have some alone time.

35:09.011 --> 35:12.246
I think we traumatized
him last night.

35:12.314 --> 35:18.185
Ha. That's-- Hey, do you think we could light
like one or two hundred more candles?

35:18.253 --> 35:20.100
You're funny.

35:20.220 --> 35:24.341
Yeah. It's--

35:26.946 --> 35:28.015
You're kidding?!

35:28.135 --> 35:28.761
What?

35:28.881 --> 35:29.862
She's a farter.

35:29.931 --> 35:32.497
Chief, no! She's not a farter.

35:32.566 --> 35:33.699
OK. All right. I'm sorry.

35:33.767 --> 35:35.525
This only happens
after sex, right?

35:35.645 --> 35:37.736
Yes. That's the only
time I ever smell it.

35:37.805 --> 35:39.199
You sure know how
to pick 'em, pal.

35:39.319 --> 35:40.683
Chief, I'm telling you.
You gotta see this woman.

35:40.803 --> 35:42.150
She's the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.144
She's the hottest chick
I've ever slept with in my life.

35:44.212 --> 35:45.852
Well, there you go.
What are you bitching about?

35:45.972 --> 35:48.033
You are sleeping with the hottest woman
you've ever seen.

35:48.153 --> 35:50.938
Count yourself lucky.
Could be sleeping with Uncle Ralph.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.255
You want to talk about farts.
He killed a plant once.

35:54.323 --> 35:55.122
Really?

35:55.191 --> 35:56.390
Outside.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.291
Oh, my God.

36:14.408 --> 36:17.415
All right, Franco, up the
ladder, vent the windows.

36:17.535 --> 36:19.021
The rest of you guys start on 4.

36:19.141 --> 36:22.648
Work your way down.
Let's move, gentlemen.

36:30.872 --> 36:36.063
Hey, Mikey, the clovers on Colleen's
dress was a really sweet touch, man.

36:36.132 --> 36:39.567
Yeah. You like that? It's very Irish
but still elegant I think, you know.

36:39.635 --> 36:42.680
Hey, Bridezilla, I hate to interrupt you.
Knock that door down, please.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.506
Don't break yo
heel while you're doing it.

36:44.575 --> 36:46.208
I got it. I got it. I got it.

36:46.277 --> 36:47.176
No, no. I'll do it.

36:47.244 --> 36:48.944
No, no. I got it. Forget it, twinkle toes.
Last thing I need

36:49.013 --> 36:51.094
is you getting hurt in a fire
and me having to explain

36:51.214 --> 36:54.450
to my daughter why she doesn't have
a dress with clovers on it.

36:54.519 --> 36:56.594
Make sure you don't
bust a hip, grandpa.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.954
If this is your way of trying
to tell me that Colleen's pregnant,

36:59.023 --> 37:00.601
I swear to God,
I'm going to kill you.

37:00.721 --> 37:03.098
Yeah, well if you kill me,
she's gonna kill you.

37:03.694 --> 37:06.266
Yeah, like I'm afraid
of my own daughter.

37:07.310 --> 37:08.945
Yeah, you are.

37:10.503 --> 37:12.636
Move all that shit over there.
I got the door.

37:12.756 --> 37:14.755
Clean this out of here.

37:24.540 --> 37:26.447
What happened?

37:27.720 --> 37:31.055
I think I just shit
my bunker pants.

37:31.124 --> 37:33.324
Why don't you try some
adult diapers, old man?

37:33.393 --> 37:38.893
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you guys take a look.

37:39.999 --> 37:41.992
- Hey, I don't like this, Garrity.
- Yeah.

37:42.112 --> 37:44.201
Do me a favor. Go see what's on
the other side of that wall.

37:44.270 --> 37:46.332
What do you mean?
Like, with the ladder?

37:47.540 --> 37:50.484
All right, I'll get the ladder.
Hey, Bobby, we need that ladder over here.

37:54.146 --> 37:56.369
Holy shit!

37:58.284 --> 37:59.953
Who needs the adult
diapers now assholes?

38:00.073 --> 38:01.862
- There's no goddamn floor.
- Or ceiling.

38:04.191 --> 38:06.124
Aww, shit, chief.
We got a problem!

38:09.964 --> 38:11.595
The whole building is
held up by bracing.

38:11.715 --> 38:13.599
Holy shit! Mayday! Mayday!

38:13.668 --> 38:17.696
The only thing holding this shitbox up
is bracing. Get your asses out now!

38:21.208 --> 38:23.042
Franco! Franco! Mayday!

38:23.110 --> 38:25.629
Mayday! Mayday! Frankie!

38:25.896 --> 38:27.122
Oh, shit!

38:27.242 --> 38:28.480
Frankie, just wait there!

38:28.549 --> 38:29.781
Ahh!

38:29.850 --> 38:32.205
Hold tight, Frankie!
We're right here Frankie! All right?

38:32.325 --> 38:33.933
We're coming for you.
Just relax.

38:34.053 --> 38:36.020
Oh shit!

38:36.089 --> 38:36.721

38:36.789 --> 38:37.421
Shit!

38:37.490 --> 38:39.278
Shit!

38:39.398 --> 38:40.472
Get that ladder right there.

38:40.592 --> 38:42.392
Damnit, get the ladder guys.

38:42.461 --> 38:44.060
- Come on!
- Hang on, Franco.

38:44.129 --> 38:46.195
Just hold tight.
We're coming for ya. Hold on!

38:46.264 --> 38:48.531
Hold on!

38:48.651 --> 38:50.333
Oh, I can't hold on!

38:50.401 --> 38:51.400
We're coming with a ladder!

38:51.469 --> 38:52.435
Put it up!

38:52.503 --> 38:57.296
Shit! Shit!

38:57.609 --> 38:59.031
I can't hold on!

38:59.151 --> 39:02.444
Shit! Shit!

39:02.513 --> 39:04.146
Take it easy.
All right, I got it.

39:04.215 --> 39:05.781
Hurry up man!

39:05.850 --> 39:07.516
- We're coming, Frank!
- Just hang tight.

39:07.585 --> 39:09.952
Hang tight. Don't panic.

39:10.021 --> 39:10.919
Easy, Tommy.

39:10.988 --> 39:13.923
All right, Frankie. Hold on.

39:13.991 --> 39:17.059
I'm trying! Come on!

39:17.128 --> 39:18.327
Easy, Tom!

39:22.266 --> 39:25.035
That's it. Good, Tom.

39:25.155 --> 39:26.711
I got it.

39:26.831 --> 39:29.163
That's it. That's it.

39:29.283 --> 39:30.273
All right, Frank.

39:30.342 --> 39:32.041
Easy!

39:32.110 --> 39:34.344
That's it. Hold him now.

39:34.412 --> 39:35.679
Come on down.

39:35.747 --> 39:37.314
Oh shit!

39:37.382 --> 39:38.315
Ugh!

39:38.384 --> 39:39.149
Jesus!

39:39.218 --> 39:42.785
I got ya. All right. All right.

39:42.854 --> 39:44.353
Holy shit!

39:44.422 --> 39:46.321
Go ahead. Go first.
Go right around.

39:46.390 --> 39:49.257
Easy guys. Easy! Easy, Frank!

39:49.326 --> 39:51.326
Hey! Hey! Hey!

39:54.398 --> 39:56.532
Come on, Frank.

39:56.601 --> 39:58.534
All right, good stuff, Frank.

39:58.603 --> 39:59.569
Come on, bud.

39:59.638 --> 40:00.637
Come on, Frank. You got it.

40:00.705 --> 40:01.571
You got it, Frank.

40:01.640 --> 40:05.710
There you go. There you go.
All right, come on, Tom. I got ya.

40:05.778 --> 40:10.270
Ugh. Unh.

40:10.390 --> 40:12.417
Lou, what the hell's
going on in there?!

40:12.486 --> 40:14.294
- We got him.
- Get the hell out of there.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.694
*** is gonna soak this bitch.

40:16.814 --> 40:19.024
All right, everybody out.
Everybody out.

40:26.522 --> 40:28.365
Hey, yo, T.

40:28.433 --> 40:29.699
What's up?

40:29.768 --> 40:33.282
I, uh...I just wanted to say,
you know--

40:34.932 --> 40:37.340
Well, you know what you did.
I just wanted to say thanks.

40:37.409 --> 40:40.243
Well, I didn't do it alone.

40:40.312 --> 40:46.250
Yeah, well you know.
All the same. Give me some.

40:49.198 --> 40:50.983
Just part of the job, pal.

40:51.103 --> 40:52.354
Yeah.

40:52.423 --> 40:55.802
And this doesn't change shit between
us on that other thing, though. Right?

40:55.922 --> 40:57.493
OK.

40:57.561 --> 41:00.051
Now which thing is that?
Is that the

41:00.171 --> 41:02.795
one where you walk around with
the holier than thou asshole attitude?

41:02.915 --> 41:05.595
Or is it the one where you try
to bang my wife?

41:05.715 --> 41:07.259
Well, actually I was referring
to the one where you,

41:07.379 --> 41:10.449
Lou, and Needles are crashing this crew
into the goddamn ground. That thing.

41:10.569 --> 41:13.082
Ah, OK. That thing.
I'm gonna forget about my next thing,

41:13.202 --> 41:17.620
which was basically very quickly beginning
to regret having saved your ass.

41:23.554 --> 41:24.956
Dick.
