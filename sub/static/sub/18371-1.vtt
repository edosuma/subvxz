00:16.000 --> 00:21.439
The two most beautiful words
in the world of comedy:

00:22.440 --> 00:23.760
Richard Pryor.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.114
(audience cheering)

00:30.480 --> 00:34.997
Good evening. Wait for the people
to get from the bathroom.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.834
People in there pissing are like,
"Wait, the shit's done started."

00:39.680 --> 00:43.117
Dave Chappelle: Richard Pryor,
undisputed champion of the world.

00:43.280 --> 00:47.957
The greatest of all times. Case
closed. Period. Exclamation point.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.440
This is the fun part for me
when the white people come back

00:50.600 --> 00:53.559
after intermission and find out
niggers have stolen their seats.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.553
(laughter)

00:55.960 --> 00:57.801
(imitating)
"We were sitting here, weren't we?"

00:57.880 --> 00:59.473
(imitating)
"Yes, we were sitting right there."

00:59.640 --> 01:01.120
(laughter)

01:02.016 --> 01:04.456
(imitating) "Well, you ain't
sitting there now, motherfucker!"

01:04.480 --> 01:06.199
It's amazing to see him live.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.272
It's like saying that
you saw Coltrane play.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.878
What you taking my picture for?

01:12.320 --> 01:14.551
You know you ain't got no film
in the camera.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.990
(laughter)

01:16.160 --> 01:19.471
Ain't nothing flashing.
Sit your ugly ass down.

01:20.240 --> 01:24.234
Most of us saw Richard
and thought, he's free flying.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.834
I want to free fly.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.674
I love when
white dudes get mad and cuss.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.830
'Cause you're all some funny
motherfuckers when you cuss.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.398
They be saying shit like,
"Yeah, come on, pecker-head!"

01:35.560 --> 01:37.756
(laughter)

01:39.680 --> 01:42.559
"Come on, you fucking jerk-off.
Come on!

01:43.040 --> 01:45.555
Yeah.
You're fuckin'-A right, buddy."

01:47.520 --> 01:49.512
Niggers be talkin' bout,
"Buddy this."

01:50.560 --> 01:54.190
Cecil: Always talked about making
them brave enough to see themselves.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.513
And the demons that he wanted
to exorcise in the audience

01:57.720 --> 02:01.509
became demons that he found hard
to exorcise in himself.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.961
(humming "Close Encounters of
the Third Kind" theme tune)

02:14.640 --> 02:16.791
Reporter: Richard Pryor,
the comedian and writer,

02:17.080 --> 02:21.313
was badly burned in an accident
at his home in California last night.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.110
Authorities say Richard Pryor
either walked or ran

02:25.280 --> 02:27.875
nearly a mile and a half
from his house to this location,

02:28.080 --> 02:30.040
- where an ambulance rescued him.
- (siren chirps)

02:30.656 --> 02:32.096
Interviewer: There was an indication

02:32.120 --> 02:34.112
that a butane lighter
exploded on Mr. Pryor.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.555
What can you tell us
about that?

02:35.720 --> 02:38.918
Right now, I'm not going to say
anything about cause or determination

02:39.080 --> 02:40.360
until we know anything for sure.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.119
Reporter: Is there any indication
that there might have been

02:42.280 --> 02:44.078
some manufacturing
of drugs on the premises?

02:44.240 --> 02:46.391
I can't say that either at this time.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.597
Reporter: Pryor's attorney talked
with reporters

02:48.760 --> 02:53.755
and disputed the LAPD theory that
Pryor was using freebase cocaine.

02:53.920 --> 02:58.517
He had a glass of rum in his hand.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.639
He was lighting a cigarette
when-- Boom!

03:01.800 --> 03:04.110
- No cocaine?
- No cocaine.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.034
If anyone is monitoring
the intercom, let me inform you

03:07.200 --> 03:11.080
that we have the right to check
the premises for flammables.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.039
We intend to make entry by force
if necessary.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.317
We have a verbal search warrant.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.640
Reporter:
Fire and police investigators

03:18.760 --> 03:19.876
obtained a search warrant

03:20.040 --> 03:23.317
and forcibly entered Pryor's home
to look for clues this morning.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.279
But police said someone had already
cleaned up the scene of the fire

03:26.440 --> 03:28.318
and they could find no evidence.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.721
Sheila Frazier: Everybody had this
sense that something was ultimately

03:31.800 --> 03:34.269
going to happen and it finally did.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.473
This is it.
He's finally killed himself.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.593
Presenter: For the first time
on television, Richard Pryor.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.271
- (applause)
- (saxophone music plays)

04:01.920 --> 04:04.071
Uh, I'm going to tell you
a few things about myself,

04:04.240 --> 04:07.039
because a lot of you probably
don't know me. I'm not a New Yorker.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.669
My home's in Peoria, Illinois.
And, uh--

04:09.840 --> 04:12.036
- (laughter)
- (clapping)

04:12.200 --> 04:13.429
Thank you.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.637
I'm from an average size family.
Eleven kids.

04:15.760 --> 04:16.875
(laughter)

04:16.959 --> 04:18.757
No mother and father, just kids.

04:19.079 --> 04:22.357
Sandy Gallin: I was roaming
around Greenwich Village

04:22.560 --> 04:27.032
and I wandered
into the Cafe au Go Go.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.513
And I saw this guy do a set

04:34.680 --> 04:39.197
and I was completely mesmerized.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.876
I thought this guy

04:43.040 --> 04:46.750
is going to be a major star,

04:46.920 --> 04:50.436
if I can get him to be able to put
two sentences together

04:50.640 --> 04:54.554
without "fuck, motherfucker, cunt".

04:54.720 --> 04:56.881
The next party you go to,
everybody'll be dancing away,

04:56.920 --> 04:58.115
having a heck of a time.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.441
One guy in the corner by himself,
checking himself out.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.557
Everybody else will be dancing.
One guy in the corner...

05:02.720 --> 05:04.757
(humming)

05:06.240 --> 05:10.393
Sandy: Richard and I would have to go
through the material,

05:11.240 --> 05:13.357
rehearsing and preparing.

05:14.240 --> 05:18.553
And it was never to make it funny.
It was to make it cleaner.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.240
Budd Friedman: I went to
the opening night

05:23.360 --> 05:25.511
at his first legitimate gig

05:25.720 --> 05:29.077
at The Living Room,
which was a chic East Side boîte.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.960
And it was very crowded.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.589
The maître d' said,
"Could Nipsey Russell join you?"

05:33.760 --> 05:35.399
"Sure. Of course. Nipsey sit down."

05:35.920 --> 05:38.799
And all during the show,
Nipsey's going... (tutting)

05:39.080 --> 05:40.275
I said,
"What's wrong with you, Nipsey?"

05:40.480 --> 05:41.755
At the end of the show.
"What was wrong?"

05:41.920 --> 05:43.513
He said, "He's doing Bill Cosby."

05:44.480 --> 05:47.200
Paul Mooney: Bill Cosby did what
they called the crossover.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.636
You know, he'd gotten
white people to like him.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.111
I think Richard thought
he had to imitate Bill

05:53.280 --> 05:57.752
to get over to become part of the
circus or whatever it was.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.520
- All the success came within a year?
- Yes.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.680
How is it up here?

06:01.880 --> 06:03.439
- Oh, wow!
- How does it come out?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.432
- Oh, hostile.
- Really?

06:05.600 --> 06:07.956
Oh, yes. I go out.
I don't know. I go crazy.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.430
Tell us the big things
that are going to happen to you.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.790
Well, a big thing
that's going to happen is,

06:11.960 --> 06:13.076
I'm going to Las Vegas.

06:21.560 --> 06:25.554
Scott Saul: He plays Vegas in 1966.
He's a huge success.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.633
That world
that he so aspired to join,

06:28.800 --> 06:30.473
wanted to impress everybody,

06:30.640 --> 06:33.838
wanted to be a big star
with his name in lights.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.151
Suddenly, there's a hollowness
to that price.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.799
Presenter: Richard Pryor.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.276
(applause)

06:41.656 --> 06:44.456
Richard Pryor: I want to really tell
you, it's really "wow" being here.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.995
My home's in Midwest, Illinois.
Peoria.

06:47.496 --> 06:49.456
- Audience member: Peoria, where?
- Richard: Yeah.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.234
Peoria where? Peoria, Illinois.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.437
Cecil Brown: When he was
in Las Vegas performing,

06:54.640 --> 06:57.519
he looked out in the audience
and saw some white people.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.354
Dean Martin was in the audience
and he was looking at him.

07:00.560 --> 07:05.351
And Richard said, "I looked
at Dean Martin through his own eyes

07:05.520 --> 07:08.877
and saw me looking
like a damn fool."

07:09.840 --> 07:11.280
Bob Newhart:
It was like an epiphany.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.193
I don't want to do it
that way anymore.

07:13.360 --> 07:17.195
I want to do it the way I hear it.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.036
That was probably when Richard Pryor
decided to become Richard Pryor.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.511
Sandy: In the middle of the night,
I got a call.

07:30.240 --> 07:34.917
"You'd better get out here, because
Richard Pryor has just gone nuts

07:35.080 --> 07:40.109
and he's literally hanging
from the chandeliers in the lobby.

07:40.280 --> 07:45.753
I want him out of the hotel,
and he is finished."

07:47.560 --> 07:50.871
No "Nice talking to you."
You know?

07:56.720 --> 08:00.714
Bob: It was all over town:
"You heard what happened last night?"

08:02.080 --> 08:04.072
And I think he was fired
the next day.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.519
Ron: It was so public, he had a Vegas gig.
That's what every comic wants.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.955
And you blew it?

08:15.960 --> 08:17.189
And I guess everybody thought,

08:17.360 --> 08:18.999
"Well, that's the end
of Richard Pryor."

08:23.240 --> 08:25.311
Sandy: I did not hear from him.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.956
I did not know where he was.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.436
Richard was gone.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.150
David Banks:
Don't try to find no logic.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.637
A lot of this in here,
logic is omitted.

08:46.760 --> 08:51.312
And sometimes, to understand Richard,
you had to first omit logic.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.834
And then you come close.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.520
Because,
what you think it ought to be,

08:55.720 --> 08:57.200
it ain't going to be nothing like it.

08:57.360 --> 09:01.434
♪ Talking, talking to the people ♪

09:16.480 --> 09:18.836
Paul: Richard is a superstar
all over again.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.840
He had a new name.

09:21.080 --> 09:24.710
It was... Edward or Edwin,
or something stupid.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.441
"This is what
I'm going to call myself."

09:26.560 --> 09:28.233
He says,
"I'm going to come and pretend

09:28.400 --> 09:30.278
like I have nothing and see how--

09:30.480 --> 09:33.040
Get to know these people here,
the hippies.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.395
I'm going to be one of them."

09:38.696 --> 09:40.456
Patricia von Heitmann:
He gave up everything.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.871
He gave up his driver's license,
his bank account.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.680
He gave up any kind of ID.

09:47.160 --> 09:50.517
He lived in this horrible little
clapboard boarding house.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.675
He invited me
to go to an after party.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.834
And, um, we weren't apart
for like six years.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.311
- I am.
- Crowd: I am.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.516
A revolutionary.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.717
Ishmael Reed: There was a lot of
feverish things going on.

10:03.880 --> 10:07.430
People asserting their rights.
Demonstrations.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.110
There was just a lot
of ferment in the Bay Area.

10:11.160 --> 10:15.040
Something different was happening
with African-American culture.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.078
It had come into its own.

10:17.240 --> 10:21.029
Richard showed up.
And gave it new life.

10:21.536 --> 10:23.176
There used to be
some beautiful black man,

10:23.200 --> 10:24.190
would come through
the neighborhood,

10:24.360 --> 10:26.875
dressed in African shit.
Really nice shit, you know.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.635
They'd be,
"Peace, love, black is beautiful.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.750
Remember the essence of life.
We are people of the universe.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.919
Life is beautiful."
My parents go, "That nigger crazy."

10:37.080 --> 10:38.150
(laughter)

10:38.440 --> 10:41.592
No one had heard him using
the N-word the way he does.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.798
He was just starting to do that.
He was tiptoeing into it.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.120
In comedy, you'd just never heard
anything like this.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.151
Cecil: So Richard would nudge
this audience to some kind of feeling

10:52.320 --> 10:55.916
about who they really were.
So, he's telling the joke.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.352
And, er, white guy in the back says,

10:59.520 --> 11:02.957
"You ought to be glad
I've got a sense of humor."

11:03.120 --> 11:05.760
And Richard said, "Yeah, I am glad
you've got a sense of humor,

11:05.920 --> 11:08.071
because I know
what you do to us niggers."

11:08.240 --> 11:13.474
He was acutely aware
of the dynamics of political,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.791
- racial segregation.
- I'd hate to be white...

11:15.960 --> 11:18.794
David Steinberg: This audience that
he was playing to was as hip

11:19.360 --> 11:21.192
an audience as you could get.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.799
And they weren't sure
they were going to go along.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.316
That's how radical Richie was.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.275
(rapping and screaming)

11:30.440 --> 11:32.750
Paul: I think he was very conscious
of what he was doing.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.191
Richard knew how to drop
atomic bomb words.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.113
He knew that words were powerful.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.318
They accidentally shoot more niggers
out here than any place in the world.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.516
Every time you pick up a paper:

11:41.720 --> 11:43.234
"Nigger accidentally shot
in the ass."

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
(laughter)

11:44.560 --> 11:47.951
How do you accidentally shoot
a nigger six times in the chest?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.240
(imitating) "Well, my gun fell
and just went crazy."

11:51.160 --> 11:53.755
David: He was fully blown
as Richie Pryor.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.520
It was astonishing.

11:56.840 --> 12:01.551
His point of view, his attack
on the culture from every version.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.509
No holds barred.
Not thinking about a career.

12:05.680 --> 12:09.310
Not thinking about what you have
to do to be right and wrong.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.161
Walter Mosley:
He wasn't a civil rights leader,

12:12.240 --> 12:14.835
like you would say Huey Newton
or Martin Luther King,

12:15.040 --> 12:17.316
but he was somebody who

12:17.480 --> 12:22.157
inculcated the spirit
of the movement.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.516
Cecil Brown:
Richard, in Berkeley, was,

12:27.720 --> 12:28.836
you know, a lovable person.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.753
But Berkeley's not the world.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.436
You had to meet the monster.
You had to go through Hollywood.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.952
Ron De Blasio:
I met Richard Pryor in 1972.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.672
At an upscale garden party
in Beverly Hills.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.272
I asked him what he was doing,
and he said, "Nothing."

13:05.520 --> 13:07.000
I said, "I know you're doing nothing,

13:07.120 --> 13:08.634
but, I mean,
what are you working at?"

13:08.800 --> 13:10.961
He said, "I'm not working
at anything. I'm unemployed."

13:11.040 --> 13:12.394
I said, "How long have you been
unemployed?"

13:12.600 --> 13:13.875
He said, "A long time."

13:14.040 --> 13:16.714
I said, "Really? Who's managing you?"
"Nobody."

13:16.880 --> 13:18.473
"Who is agenting you?"
"Nobody."

13:19.640 --> 13:22.200
He didn't really have any place
to go at that time,

13:22.400 --> 13:26.713
so he took a job,
doing punch-up lines for Redd Foxx.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.596
I thought, "This is not right."

13:29.760 --> 13:31.911
So, I said to Richie,
"Let's record an album."

13:34.400 --> 13:36.710
Richard: Don't ever marry
a white woman in California.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.074
A lot of you sisters are probably,

13:39.240 --> 13:41.277
"Don't marry a white woman anyway,
nigger."

13:41.440 --> 13:43.397
(cheering)

13:43.560 --> 13:45.233
"Why should you be happy?"

13:45.560 --> 13:47.836
(laughter)

13:50.080 --> 13:51.912
Sisters look at you
like you killed your mama

13:52.080 --> 13:53.833
when you're out with a white woman.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.113
You can't laugh that shit off either.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.720
(imitating) "She's not with me."

13:58.920 --> 14:00.912
(laughter)

14:01.240 --> 14:05.951
Richard said, "Look, I know that you
like it and I know that I like it.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.639
Black people don't like this."

14:08.960 --> 14:11.156
I said, "Richard,
I can't answer that. I don't know."

14:11.520 --> 14:15.116
He said, "Let's hope so.
If not, we're both out of business."

14:15.280 --> 14:17.795
I don't know how you feel
about the title of your album,

14:18.000 --> 14:19.832
- but I find it difficult to say.
- You do.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.350
Most white people,
it's hard to say "crazy".

14:22.520 --> 14:24.000
(laughter)

14:24.200 --> 14:25.839
No, the title. You tell them the
title of the album.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.030
I can't say that.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.800
The title of the album is
"That Nigger's Crazy."

14:29.960 --> 14:31.189
(laughter)

14:31.360 --> 14:34.353
See now, you can just say that.
If I said that, won't you get mad?

14:34.560 --> 14:36.279
I'd punch you out.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.318
(laughter and applause)

14:43.840 --> 14:47.038
Michael Schultz:
While I was in my college years,

14:47.280 --> 14:51.832
we'd get together
and play Richard Pryor LPs

14:52.000 --> 14:53.798
and have listening parties.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.680
My father when he ate was fun.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.720
(imitating father)
"Hey, bitch, where the food?"

14:58.320 --> 15:01.836
"Goddamn mother, come on.
Oh, you motherfucker!"

15:02.040 --> 15:03.076
(laughter)

15:03.240 --> 15:05.630
Budd: Saying "fuck" in those days
was unheard of.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.832
They had blue laws,
for crying out loud.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.280
Mike Epps: It was just a secret.

15:09.520 --> 15:14.879
It was like learning how to say,
"Motherfucker. Bitch, kiss my ass."

15:16.240 --> 15:20.029
Ron: The people that had it first,
I don't know why,

15:20.240 --> 15:22.675
they were pimps and hoes.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.992
Mike: This is the only guy
really touching on some shit like,

15:26.160 --> 15:29.392
Oh, taboo to other people. Like,
"Don't go there."

15:30.320 --> 15:32.516
He was the Messiah, the messenger,

15:32.840 --> 15:34.672
for the real niggers in the streets

15:35.040 --> 15:37.509
that wanted to express
themselves but couldn't.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.681
Ron: The album
was a Grammy award winner.

15:40.760 --> 15:45.232
Number one on the R&B charts
in 1974 for five weeks,

15:45.400 --> 15:48.677
which is unheard of for
a comedy album in the R&B charts.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.198
Thom Mount: This was a time when
Richard was moving up very quickly.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.477
It was rather like
being fired out of a cannon.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.793
Alan Farley: We hardly ever went
to two gigs in sequence.

15:59.960 --> 16:04.751
From LA, to Washington, back to LA,
to New York, back to LA.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.393
You use the term, "Nigger".

16:07.560 --> 16:10.792
Now, does the black community get
on you for using that on a show?

16:10.960 --> 16:14.158
- How do you answer that?
- I say, "Nigger, get out of my face!"

16:14.320 --> 16:15.390
(laughter)

16:16.695 --> 16:19.336
Paul: People were fascinated with
Richard, especially white people.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.080
They never heard anybody talk
like that. They were fascinated.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.631
How could this young, black person
have this kind of power?

16:25.960 --> 16:27.394
That's power.

16:32.615 --> 16:35.376
George Lopez: When he would drive
down and perform, word would spread.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.154
Everybody got on the phone and said,
"Richard's at The Comedy Store."

16:38.400 --> 16:39.914
The word got out so quickly

16:40.080 --> 16:41.753
that Richard was backstage
at The Comedy Store,

16:41.920 --> 16:46.073
but by the time he got on,
there wasn't a comedian in town

16:46.240 --> 16:47.754
who wasn't in the audience.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.360
Richard: I took some acid once, too.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.432
A white dude gave me some.
At a party.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.478
Dude said, "This is far out."

16:54.600 --> 16:56.671
Get the fuck out of my face!

16:56.840 --> 16:58.957
About 20 minutes later,
I was at the party, you know,

16:59.160 --> 17:01.117
"I can't breathe!

17:01.280 --> 17:03.237
I don't remember how to breathe!"

17:04.960 --> 17:07.077
(imitating)
"I told you it was far out."

17:07.240 --> 17:08.469
(laughter and applause)

17:08.640 --> 17:13.839
Alan: When he performed, he would
sometimes make a couple of notes

17:14.000 --> 17:16.560
on the back of an envelope
of some of the things he might do.

17:16.760 --> 17:22.279
He never worked out in advance what
his... It wasn't really a routine.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.477
Skip Brittenham: Every night,
you see something different

17:24.640 --> 17:25.835
that you hadn't seen before.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.630
He would do a riff here and a riff
there. Just spontaneously.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.519
What kind of shit
are you handing me?

17:31.720 --> 17:35.475
What the fuck is it? I don't know
what you're handing me to sign.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.199
What the fuck does it say on it?

17:37.640 --> 17:41.111
Champagne! Listen, I ain't signing
for no goddamn champagne.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.841
Alan: He was always
doing something new.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.714
All of a sudden, "Oh, my God,
look what he's doing now!"

17:45.880 --> 17:48.315
He wasn't just telling jokes,
he was telling stories.

17:49.400 --> 17:54.236
And stories that were so vivid
and so funny

17:54.400 --> 17:56.153
that you had to stay with him.

17:56.320 --> 17:59.677
And you think, "OK, that's amazing."

17:59.840 --> 18:02.594
Lily Tomlin: I mean, he just had
that laser-like wit.

18:02.760 --> 18:07.277
Bringing so much tenderness to it.
And do the wino on the street.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.992
I'm going to help you, boy,
because I think you've got potential.

18:11.815 --> 18:13.976
That's right. You can be
somebody because you're sharp.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.356
You know what I mean?
Try some of that.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.196
Don't you drop it, nigger.
Put it safe.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.759
Bob: You're watching a world that,

18:21.920 --> 18:25.834
at least in my case, I would never
have known but for Richard Pryor.

18:26.200 --> 18:30.353
What a colorful world it is
that he paints.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.032
Thom: He'd go out and he'd do two
minutes, three minutes, sometimes,

18:34.200 --> 18:36.920
if the wind was right,
he'd do four or five minutes.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.551
Eventually, there'd
be about 40 minutes of material.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.917
And when there was
40 minutes of material,

18:43.360 --> 18:46.956
he knew then he could get
from there to a concert.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.876
I discovered masturbating
by accident.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.879
I'm not lying.
I was about ten. I was in the tub.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.395
And that's when you used to hold
your dick with two fingers.

18:59.560 --> 19:00.914
(laughter)

19:01.360 --> 19:02.760
Hey!

19:06.240 --> 19:08.118
I'm on to something here.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.269
I bet Dad don't know about this.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.797
He understood how to excavate
the human soul on stage

19:15.960 --> 19:18.919
in front of 600 people,
without blinking.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.232
First time I came to ejaculate,
it scared the fuck out of me.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.072
I thought something was wrong.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.358
I was with this woman. I said, "Look,
what the fuck you done did!"

19:30.400 --> 19:33.757
About an hour later, I was back.
"Can you do it again?"

19:34.920 --> 19:37.594
Dave: I think if comedy was a woman
I'm in love with,

19:37.760 --> 19:40.992
I know Richard Pryor
would just fuck the shit out of her.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.920
He'd fuck her in every orifice
of her body.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.319
Can I...? Is there anywhere this guy
didn't fucking put his prints on?

19:50.960 --> 19:54.431
Lonette McKee: Richard had become big
in the live concert,

19:54.600 --> 19:57.513
doing his brand of risqué humor.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.195
These large audiences
were fascinated with Richard.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.431
He had not crossed into film.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.313
Patricia:
Somehow, Berry Gordy tracked him down

20:09.680 --> 20:13.959
and wanted him to audition
for the role of Piano Man

20:14.120 --> 20:16.954
in the film he was about to do
of Billie Holiday,

20:17.120 --> 20:19.316
which was going to star
Diana Ross.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.635
Paul: Lady Sings The Blues,
when Richard auditioned,

20:22.800 --> 20:24.154
they let him do improv.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.880
You can't let Richard to improv,
he'll steal the show.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.560
Which he did. The rest is history.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.791
Everybody got
a room full of girls at home.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.440
You're just going to be another one.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.000
Billie, you've got too much going.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.040
Come on. You don't need
this gutter-pusher shit.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.152
Stan Shaw:
He was huge in Lady Sings The Blues.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.915
It sealed it for him
in terms of his performance

20:42.080 --> 20:44.311
and having the audience crave
to see more of him.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.877
- (knocking)
- We're coming.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.676
Paul: That part got bigger
and bigger and bigger.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.911
By the time they finished
cutting that movie,

20:54.080 --> 20:55.912
Richard was co-star in that movie.

21:01.840 --> 21:04.196
Mel Brooks: I met him in '72.

21:04.360 --> 21:08.240
He wasn't that famous,
but the word was out.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.954
I said to him, "Why don't you meet me
for breakfast?"

21:14.120 --> 21:18.273
He said, "Breakfast. OK. I'll meet
you at four." I said, "Four?"

21:19.520 --> 21:22.911
I told him about
a black sheriff in 1874.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.754
He loved the idea. He just loved it.

21:25.920 --> 21:29.516
I said, "I'm going to fight for you
to be the lead in Blazing Saddles."

21:29.760 --> 21:32.320
I said, "Look, I'm going to write it
like a gang comedy.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.319
Anybody got a good idea, it's in.
We're all going to be equal.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.240
I will be a little more equal
than anybody else,

21:38.640 --> 21:42.316
but we're all going to be equal
and we're all going to have fun.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.319
I want you to be
one of the writers."

21:47.240 --> 21:48.674
Ron: He called me up.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.912
And said, "Listen, I would like
to be the star of that film,

21:52.120 --> 21:53.998
Blazing Saddles.
That would be terrific."

21:54.160 --> 21:55.640
This is going to be something big.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.074
Mel: I wrote most of the black jokes,

21:58.240 --> 22:00.118
and Richard wrote
most of the Mongo jokes.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.079
He was like this big, tough baby.

22:03.240 --> 22:07.314
Richard wrote lines like,
"Mongo only pawn in game of life."

22:07.480 --> 22:08.550
...game of life.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.229
He wrote these meshuggener,
wacky lines.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.916
The next day, he showed up
in my apartment with cigars

22:15.080 --> 22:19.757
and a very expensive Dunhill
lighter, and I said, "What's this?"

22:19.920 --> 22:22.230
He said, "We're going to be signing
a lot of contracts."

22:27.320 --> 22:29.789
Mel: Somebody higher up
at Warner Brothers had heard

22:29.960 --> 22:33.840
that Richard was doing drugs
and Richard was unreliable

22:34.040 --> 22:35.076
and I was fighting.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.635
He said, "We appreciate
his contribution as a writer.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.836
We know how funny he is.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.555
It's the starring role.
We won't star him in the picture."

22:42.000 --> 22:45.596
It got to the fucking board
of Warner Brothers,

22:46.200 --> 22:49.591
where he lost on some vote,
and that was it. You know.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.961
Scott: He wished that he got
the starring role.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.955
That was a disappointment,
a major disappointment.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.835
Patricia: Just put him over the edge
when they said that.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.880
And he became high,
so high and out of control.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.760
So he decided to shoot up the house.

23:12.280 --> 23:16.194
We had a huge saltwater fish tank,
it was like 150 gallons.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.510
I mean it was huge.

23:17.680 --> 23:22.800
And, of course, it killed
all the fish and buckled the floor

23:23.000 --> 23:27.313
and shot the Charlie Parker painting
that was hanging above the fireplace.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.597
A huge Charlie Parker painting.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.029
He shot him in the heart.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.995
Cecil: It's really hard
to live in Hollywood.

23:39.320 --> 23:41.198
It's so controlled by white men.

23:41.880 --> 23:46.432
Very hard to do anything, because
they're so greedy and so insecure.

23:47.040 --> 23:51.193
Patricia: He decided he was going to
fire everyone and start all over.

23:51.360 --> 23:55.354
New lawyers, new agent, new manager.

23:55.520 --> 23:59.230
He called Ron
and just said it was over.

23:59.400 --> 24:03.440
I mean, it was a pretty harsh,
cold moment.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.636
Ron: "So, what became
of the change of heart?"

24:07.400 --> 24:09.232
He said,
"I don't know, man. Just did."

24:09.760 --> 24:13.879
I puzzled over that for many,
many years.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.358
Richard: I don't like movies when
they don't have no niggers in them.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.671
(laughter)

24:23.560 --> 24:25.870
I went to see Logan's Run, right.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.390
They had a movie of the future
called Logan's Run,

24:28.560 --> 24:30.074
and there ain't no niggers in it.

24:30.280 --> 24:33.273
I said, "Well, white folks
ain't planning for us to be here."

24:37.040 --> 24:38.759
That's why we've got to make movies.

24:45.080 --> 24:49.871
Lonette: David was a very powerful
black manager, based out of Atlanta.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.555
Very militant. Very pro-black.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.560
Very, very smart.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.393
A gift for making huge deals
and huge money.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.197
And Hollywood loved David.

25:02.200 --> 25:07.798
Cecil: David Franklin was a pudgy,
brilliant, black man, who stuttered.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.920
And Richard loved that.

25:10.080 --> 25:15.280
He said, "Because he st-st-utters,
he can ge-get sympathy."

25:15.600 --> 25:17.592
So, David went on to manage Richard,

25:17.760 --> 25:20.912
be his agent and act as his lawyer.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.550
Lonette: Other than Richard's
pure talent,

25:23.720 --> 25:28.351
David was absolutely responsible for
Richard becoming really big in film.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.591
Thom: We did nine or ten
pictures together.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.111
The first of them, The Bingo Long
Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings,

25:36.280 --> 25:37.953
about the Negro National Leagues.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.080
Richard: Like batting averages.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.675
See, you take the number of times
a man been in bat

25:42.840 --> 25:45.833
and you divide that by the number
of times a man got a hit.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.199
Like me, I've been in bat 100 times.
I've got 25 hits. That's simple.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.198
Twenty-five goes into 100 four times.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.959
It gives me a batting average
of four.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.318
That's wrong.
That ain't no way to do that.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.312
Thom: The second film was Car Wash.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.720
I wasn't going to make
that movie without Richard.

26:01.800 --> 26:07.194
Believe in the Lord and, most of
all, believe in that federal green.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.035
Lonette: I remember the day

26:10.200 --> 26:12.840
that David came back
from a meeting with Richard,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.595
driving a brand-new Rolls-Royce.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.998
He must have been doing something
that was making Richard pretty happy

26:19.160 --> 26:21.720
for Richard to give him
a brand-new Rolls-Royce as a gift.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.317
Right at that moment,
the notion that he could hold

26:25.520 --> 26:29.719
the lead in a picture
was a totally unproven notion.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.230
Richard: Take this radio.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.359
When you step out, you got
to step out of here like king shit.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.432
Right, you bad.
Put that radio to your ear.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.875
That's going to help cover
your face, all right.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.872
- Move with the rhythm of the music.
- (music plays through radio)

26:41.040 --> 26:42.235
Move your body
with the rhythm of the music.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.074
That's all you've got to remember.
Let me see you try.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.197
Step to the music.
Step to the music. Yeah.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.511
Step to the music.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.750
Stop.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.199
How come you whities
got such a tight ass, man? Do it.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.794
Can't you feel it? The tempo...

27:01.560 --> 27:04.837
Scott: He basically launched
a new genre of comedy:

27:05.200 --> 27:06.714
Interracial buddy comedy.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.716
This was a new kind of formula
for comedy in Hollywood.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.031
He broke the glass ceiling.

27:13.600 --> 27:17.150
Lonette: He made earning a certain
amount of money for black people

27:17.360 --> 27:19.875
that was not possible at that time,
possible.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.874
One of the films I did with him,
called Which Way Is Up?,

27:23.040 --> 27:27.034
I designed the film
around his stand-up routine.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.396
Come on, Pop,
get your old ass out here.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.398
Michael: Richard played himself.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.552
He played his father.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.070
Fuck you!

27:36.240 --> 27:38.880
I heard that. Fuck you too, boy!

27:39.040 --> 27:41.032
And he played a bootleg preacher.

27:41.200 --> 27:45.752
What kind of lowlife dog, scoundrel,
snake in the grass...

27:45.920 --> 27:50.073
Michael: I think it was the first black
film that ever did multiple characters.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.913
Cecil: Richard would come and say,
"Hey, Cecil, come to watch this."

27:54.400 --> 27:56.756
I come upstairs and he said, "Look!"

27:57.600 --> 28:01.071
I look out the window,
and by the swimming pool,

28:01.280 --> 28:06.674
would be sitting famous
white people, famous producers,

28:07.280 --> 28:10.432
dying to be allowed
to come up the stairs,

28:10.600 --> 28:12.398
up to the place where we were.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.233
- Do you ever go home?
- Yes, I do.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.756
- I'm not allowed in Peoria any more.
- I didn't know that.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.794
When you make some money, niggers
don't want you in town no more.

28:19.960 --> 28:24.796
Paul Schrader: He desired to be
the biggest star in entertainment.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.635
As big as Cosby, as big as Poitier.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.551
He also wanted
to be the blackest star.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.076
You know. As black as Malcolm X.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.632
- Bird head.
- Cracker.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.673
- Spear chucker.
- White trash.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.911
- Jungle bunny.
- Honky.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.159
Bob: His appearances
on Saturday Night Live were

28:48.320 --> 28:51.996
very instrumental in walking
the very thin line between

28:52.160 --> 28:55.437
what was acceptable on television
and his mind.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.117
- Nigger.
- Dead honky.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.793
My grandmother would walk
by the living room and she'd say,

29:02.960 --> 29:04.400
"Are you watching that Negro again?"

29:04.480 --> 29:06.870
It was the only black person my
grandmother would allow in the house

29:07.040 --> 29:08.360
was Richard Pryor.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.830
The audiences absolutely loved it.
The network loved it.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.151
That's why the network
went after him

29:15.320 --> 29:19.360
and said, "We want you to do
a television show."

29:23.400 --> 29:25.551
Rocco Urbisci: We had the best time.

29:25.720 --> 29:30.476
When you have the support of someone
who carries that much weight,

29:30.640 --> 29:34.156
it trickles down to everybody
to be courageous and crazy.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.033
- Mr. President, Mr. President.
- Yes.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.795
Mr. President,
since you've become President,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.196
you've been courting
an awful lot of white women.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.033
Will this continue?

29:43.440 --> 29:45.557
(laughter)

29:48.240 --> 29:50.311
As long as I can keep it up.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.071
Rocco: I actually hired
a court stenographer,

29:53.240 --> 29:54.879
- because the ideas were...
- (clicking)

29:55.040 --> 29:56.720
One day he walked
into the conference room,

29:56.880 --> 30:00.191
he jumped on the table and said,
"Let Bojaws handle it."

30:00.440 --> 30:02.033
We didn't know who Bojaws was.

30:02.520 --> 30:03.670
What do you say?

30:03.840 --> 30:04.876
(shouting)

30:05.040 --> 30:06.040
Are you crippled?

30:07.200 --> 30:09.032
Let Bojaws handle it.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.879
Bojaws was this weird medicine man
that lived in the Louisiana bayou.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.240
Healing people.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.719
Mr. Bojaws, I've got a bad arm.
I can't move it.

30:19.920 --> 30:24.073
He's got a bad arm
and he can't move it.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.392
- (crowd gasping)
- (crunching)

30:28.400 --> 30:30.357
Let Bojaws handle it.

30:30.520 --> 30:34.036
It was ground-breaking
within the rules

30:34.200 --> 30:36.954
of how mundane
television was at the time.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.918
There's a lot of things
written about me.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.958
People wondering
if I'm going to have a show,

30:41.120 --> 30:44.238
if I'm not going to have a show.
Well, I'm having a show.

30:44.560 --> 30:48.600
People say, "How can you have
a show? You've got to compromise.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.434
You've got to give up everything."

30:51.600 --> 30:53.114
Is that a joke or what?

30:53.640 --> 30:56.439
Well, look at me!
I'm standing here naked.

30:58.760 --> 31:02.151
I've given up absolutely nothing.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.679
(laughing and cheering)

31:06.960 --> 31:09.680
So, enjoy the show.

31:11.016 --> 31:13.136
Robin Williams: It was pretty crazy.
It was wonderful.

31:13.160 --> 31:16.790
He was always pushing the envelope.
That's when I went, wow!

31:17.320 --> 31:20.438
That was the best thing, the start
of the season. It was like, wow!

31:20.695 --> 31:22.496
Lily Tomlin:
He was always between two worlds.

31:22.520 --> 31:26.639
He was between that acceptable,
sort of mainstream white world,

31:26.800 --> 31:31.113
and, of course, a much stronger,
harder, knowing street place.

31:31.600 --> 31:35.355
But the networks were so leery
of him, so scared of him.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.437
Rocco: The show was supposed
to air that night.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.320
NBC censored the opening.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.671
I called Richard at home and said,

31:43.880 --> 31:46.349
"You know we're going to edit out
the naked opening."

31:46.520 --> 31:49.638
It caused a shit storm. He quit.

31:53.695 --> 31:55.496
Robin: The first thing
is you start off going,

31:55.520 --> 31:57.477
"This is my attempt
to make a statement.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.514
If they don't air that,
that really sets the rules. OK.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.080
You're not going to let me do
what I'm going to do."

32:07.640 --> 32:10.553
John Moffitt: Richard came back and,
after pleasantries, Richard said,

32:10.720 --> 32:14.509
"Television chews you up and
spits you out, and I don't want that

32:14.680 --> 32:18.310
to happen to me, so
I've decided not to do the series."

32:20.000 --> 32:23.914
He went to NBC and, of course,
they said Richard had to do the show.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.878
They weren't going to let him
off the hook.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.839
From the looks of things,
I'll be seeing you next time.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.994
NBC made sure of that.
I'm not going anywhere.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.671
They kept saying,
you've got to be more mainstream.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.832
He was going:
"No, fuck you. No, we can't."

32:41.000 --> 32:42.719
If it wasn't real, fuck it.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.600
You know what I mean?
He wasn't compromising.

32:46.080 --> 32:49.073
Rocco is the token
white person on the show.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.720
John: He wanted a lot
of changes made.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.714
He wanted more black people
involved in the production staff.

32:53.880 --> 32:57.351
He only wanted
three "whities" to come back.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.557
Rocco: We're in a rehearsal hall
one day,

32:59.720 --> 33:01.359
and a guy walks in

33:01.520 --> 33:06.037
with an African cap,
a dashiki and a stick.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.436
I said, "Richard, who is that guy?"

33:09.880 --> 33:11.758
He said,
"His name is Prophet Jennings.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.036
He's a nigger expert."

33:13.600 --> 33:16.080
John: He was the one to judge
whether Richard was black enough.

33:16.240 --> 33:20.553
Richard looked at him, and he'd
either go like this or like that.

33:20.720 --> 33:24.555
I love American people.
I want to say, I had two for lunch.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.951
(laughing)

33:27.440 --> 33:30.194
In the end,
they demanded that he do stand-up,

33:30.400 --> 33:32.960
which didn't sit well with him,
anybody making demands on him.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.555
So they recorded 45 minutes
of him doing stand-up.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.279
They had ten seconds they could use.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.432
A lot of people here
might be offended.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.593
So you should leave, because
I'm going to say fuck and suck.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.274
And shit and doo-doo.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.316
It's amazing that he got things
on that he got on,

33:50.480 --> 33:53.393
but it's only because 90 percent
of what he wanted to get on

33:53.560 --> 33:56.439
he didn't get on, that ten percent
of it actually got through them,

33:56.600 --> 33:59.752
because they couldn't fight
with him that much.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.240
Those bells again!

34:01.960 --> 34:04.111
That was it.
He went out swinging.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.116
Well, good night.
See you next week.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.398
(laughter)

34:20.800 --> 34:23.952
And we're delighted to have with us
two of the very best friends I have

34:24.159 --> 34:27.835
who dropped by:
Miss Pam Grier and Mr. Richard Pryor.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.032
(applause)

34:33.639 --> 34:35.552
Rocco: Richard was dating Pam Grier.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.597
You know, she was crazy
about that guy.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.871
We bumped into each other on the set
of Greased Lightning, in which

34:42.040 --> 34:46.193
we were both starring in, which
will be released sometime in April.

34:46.360 --> 34:49.114
- You say you bumped into each other.
- Yes, we bumped.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.272
That must have been
quite a collision.

34:53.496 --> 34:55.576
Jennifer Lee Pryor: I know that
Richard's grandmother

34:55.600 --> 34:57.671
wanted Richard to marry Pam.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.991
She thought she was certainly
an accomplished actress.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.795
She was black
and she was a healthy girl.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.189
She wasn't a party girl.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.511
I'll be jogging in the morning,
police.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.514
Me and Rashon, two black men,
will be jogging.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.512
We're not robbing anything.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.352
John: Richard was completely sober.

35:14.560 --> 35:17.394
He played tennis
every morning at seven o'clock.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.916
It was a Richard that I had not seen.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.752
Rocco: Richard came into my office
and said,

35:22.920 --> 35:25.674
"I'm getting married tomorrow.
I'll be late."

35:26.760 --> 35:30.879
I said, "Wow! Congratulations!
That's fucking great."

35:39.280 --> 35:41.078
I had a cake this big.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.719
"Congratulations, Richard and Pam."

35:50.240 --> 35:52.516
My phone rings and Pam says:

35:52.680 --> 35:55.320
"You tell the son of a bitch
I'm coming down I'm gonna kill him."

35:59.200 --> 36:01.078
Richard Pryor had married a girl...

36:02.240 --> 36:05.039
...that he got pregnant.
And he walks in.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.033
I start moving the cake out.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.920
He looks at the cake and realizes
that it's Pam on there

36:10.080 --> 36:11.720
and there's Richard
with this other woman.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.594
There was a prop cart,
and it had plastic flowers on.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.431
I shoved it
in the middle of the cake,

36:18.760 --> 36:20.592
to blur out "Pam and Richard".

36:22.215 --> 36:23.776
Jennifer: A lot of people
were surprised

36:23.800 --> 36:24.960
that Richard married Deborah,

36:25.120 --> 36:27.760
because it did come out of,
sort of come out of nowhere.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.669
There were many women
in Richard's life.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.397
I recognized and he told me this,

36:33.720 --> 36:35.393
that they wouldn't
be around that long.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.000
Richard: This is about the...
time I'd been married,

36:38.280 --> 36:42.433
and it was really exciting
because I really am trying,

36:42.600 --> 36:44.910
I really am trying.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.795
I'm telling you I'm fucking trying,
OK?

36:50.120 --> 36:54.637
But it's hard to wake up and see
the same person all the fucking time.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.956
David: Richard had--
I done forgotten now.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.954
Eight, nine, 12 wives. I don't know.

37:01.120 --> 37:06.593
But I know that all of them was
what they was to him when they was.

37:08.600 --> 37:09.954
Was once was.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.757
Paul: Richard had a pimp's mentality.

37:12.920 --> 37:16.152
He pretends like he's controllable.
He's like a spider.

37:16.320 --> 37:19.154
That's to lure you in till you get
caught in the web.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.358
Richard had a compulsion
to be married,

37:22.480 --> 37:24.039
because he didn't want to be alone.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.836
But once he would marry,
the magic would be off.

37:28.200 --> 37:31.113
It would be gone because he won.

37:31.320 --> 37:34.154
If he wanted you, you had that power.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.950
And usually that would
just about last until he got you.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.396
And then it would be time to go
after another woman.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.994
And that was the game with Richard.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.560
Then the whole fun of the game was,

37:44.720 --> 37:46.439
"How do I get this bitch
out of my house?"

37:47.000 --> 37:51.870
Skip: I was the best man at a wedding
with Jennifer in Hana, Maui.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.391
And the next morning after
the wedding, I was in my room,

37:55.560 --> 37:58.553
and about seven in the morning,
there is a knock on the door.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.350
I go and open the door,
and there's Richard Pryor.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.993
I said, "Richard, what are you doing
here at seven in the morning?"

38:06.520 --> 38:09.115
And he says, "I want a divorce."

38:09.360 --> 38:12.239
No, I'd like to die
like my father died.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.358
Right, my father died fucking.

38:15.520 --> 38:20.356
He did. My father was 57 when
he died, right. The woman was 18.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.958
My father came and went
at the same time.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.112
(laughter)

38:29.360 --> 38:31.040
Would you like to introduce
our next guest?

38:31.120 --> 38:32.759
- Yes, who?
- Your grandmother.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.195
Oh, man, don't do that.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.358
(applause)

38:39.960 --> 38:41.553
(cheering)

38:43.080 --> 38:45.879
- I'm told that you run a pool hall.
- Yes, I do.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.111
Did Richard spend much
time in the pool hall?

38:48.280 --> 38:50.920
Yes, he used to come down there
and shoot pool after school.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.590
They used to cuss in the pool
room before she took over.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.036
Now the language is, "Why you..."

38:57.040 --> 38:58.440
I keep them in their place.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.115
See, I'm an old lady
and I stay in old ladies' place

39:01.280 --> 39:03.112
and I respect them young men,

39:03.280 --> 39:05.078
and they must respect me,
isn't that right?

39:05.280 --> 39:06.280
That's exactly right.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.635
(applause)

39:09.960 --> 39:11.952
Rashon Khan:
I remember meeting Marie Carter.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.960
She's a grandmother
that you see in books.

39:15.560 --> 39:19.395
She had the long white hair
and she was dressed very smart.

39:20.160 --> 39:25.952
I bow to her. And this old bitch
hit me in my chest so hard.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.315
Boom!

39:27.960 --> 39:32.796
And I felt the breath leave out
and before I let her hit me again,

39:32.960 --> 39:34.679
I rushed and started choking her.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.911
And she started laughing at me.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.993
She'd laugh like it was
the funniest shit she had seen.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.637
And Richard stood to the left and he
said, "That's my grandmother, man."

39:47.680 --> 39:51.435
Richard: I was born Richard Franklin
Lennox Thomas Pryor Ill.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.754
I got names from pimps
and gangsters.

39:55.920 --> 40:01.632
Grew up seeing my mother
go into rooms with men

40:01.800 --> 40:03.996
and my aunties
go into rooms with men.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.152
I remember tricks used to come
through our neighborhood.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.834
That's where
I first met white people.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.640
They come down through our
neighborhood to help the economy.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.360
Man, but I met nice white men.

40:13.520 --> 40:14.874
(imitating) "Hello, little boy,
is your mother home?

40:15.040 --> 40:16.156
I'd like a blowjob."

40:18.000 --> 40:21.789
When he told us about it, we laughed.
"Get the fuck out of here."

40:21.960 --> 40:26.398
"Your mother sucked dick?"
We didn't really grasp it.

40:26.560 --> 40:30.110
And when you realize it really
happened. It wasn't jokes.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.680
It makes us, if you didn't have that
experience go, "What is that like?"

40:34.840 --> 40:36.559
And how do you maintain love?

40:37.320 --> 40:39.312
His uncle and his daddy were pimps.

40:40.640 --> 40:45.032
I'm talking about not no play pimps,
real pimps.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.193
Them guys would pimp a Barbie doll.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.352
"Bitch, go out and get the money."

40:50.680 --> 40:54.151
Scott: The grandmother was the madam
in chief of the whole operation.

40:54.840 --> 40:57.912
Basically, keep the girls in line.
Keep the Johns in line.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.877
Rashon:
That's when I realized who she was.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.511
In terms of this is the whole house,
she runs everything.

41:05.015 --> 41:06.856
You know, she lived
in the south side in Peoria

41:06.880 --> 41:09.156
and she could sleep
with the door unlocked.

41:09.600 --> 41:13.071
People knew you're not coming
up in this house.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.397
You know if you do come up
in the house,

41:15.560 --> 41:17.233
you know what's going to happen.

41:18.120 --> 41:22.034
Jennifer: The grandmother was
the matriarch of the family,

41:22.200 --> 41:25.113
upon whom everybody else's
survival depended.

41:25.280 --> 41:29.035
She was Richard's nurturer,

41:29.200 --> 41:31.396
the punisher, the disciplinarian.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.960
Everything rolled into one.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.077
My grandmother would wake my ass up,
you know.

41:35.240 --> 41:38.312
(imitating grandmother)
"Get your ass, put your hand--

41:38.480 --> 41:40.119
"Get your ass, put your hand--
Don't you run from me."

41:40.360 --> 41:42.920
"Don't you run... from... me."

41:44.080 --> 41:47.437
You were 15 years old
when your first child was born?

41:47.600 --> 41:49.557
Yeah. Yeah.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.799
- How could you...?
- It was fun.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.280
And then after she was born?

41:55.440 --> 41:57.750
I didn't know my father
was making love to her too.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.594
And I was standing
in the dining room, and I was crying.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.956
My mother said,
"What's wrong with the boy, Bucky?"

42:03.160 --> 42:04.480
My father said,
"Ain't nothing wrong with him.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.233
"He got some girl pregnant."

42:08.240 --> 42:11.836
Michael: I think, when you grow up
around a bordello,

42:12.000 --> 42:16.791
you see people at their very core,
in a way.

42:16.960 --> 42:21.477
There's no facade,
there's no masks on.

42:23.120 --> 42:26.636
Richard: I don't know what it was
that made me that way,

42:27.800 --> 42:29.792
that could laugh at anything.

42:30.840 --> 42:36.677
Nothing was too sad, some humor
could not be found in it.

42:38.920 --> 42:43.153
Michael: His sensitivity made him
so brilliant as a comedian.

42:43.320 --> 42:48.793
But some things were so painful
that he wanted to be somewhere else.

42:49.120 --> 42:54.036
I think if you are
a sensitive type that it...

42:55.200 --> 42:56.793
That you self-medicate.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.033
It's easier to self-medicate.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.711
Richard: I snorted cocaine
for about 15 years.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.953
I must have snorted up Peru.

43:09.800 --> 43:13.157
He'd do a line and drink
some Courvoisier. That's lunch.

43:13.360 --> 43:16.159
I'm going to have some lunch,
get high. Go back to work.

43:16.360 --> 43:20.195
Watching Dad doing drugs, you know,
snorting some lines or smoking...

43:20.520 --> 43:23.194
those were things
that you didn't really question.

43:23.640 --> 43:27.680
Richard: Listen, I was doing so much,
I embarrassed cocaine dealers.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.235
They would say,
"Richard, man, God damn."

43:33.200 --> 43:35.351
"Well, how much do you want?"
"Kilo...

43:37.520 --> 43:39.000
Just for the weekend."

43:40.720 --> 43:43.918
Patricia: A lot of people came
to the house to play cards, hang out.

43:44.080 --> 43:47.391
For the drugs, of course,
because he bought coke by the key.

43:47.600 --> 43:51.833
Low-lifes, drug dealers,
card people, hookers.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.719
I don't like cocaine, I love it.

43:53.880 --> 43:55.553
That's why
I have to stay away from it.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.559
I enjoyed it for a long time.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.518
Maybe you want
to change your whole life

43:59.680 --> 44:02.400
and you swear tomorrow
I'll never do this again.

44:02.560 --> 44:03.755
Stan Shaw:
Success doesn't change you.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.754
It only magnifies
who you've been all your life.

44:06.920 --> 44:10.231
And success magnified
the kid from Peoria with Richard.

44:10.400 --> 44:14.713
But now he had endless money,
endless fame.

44:14.920 --> 44:18.516
Thom: When he would betray himself,
which he did with some frequency,

44:18.680 --> 44:23.038
he thought that that betrayal
belonged to everyone else.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.078
If he was
in a particularly good mood

44:25.240 --> 44:27.391
and he was being nice to everybody,
he could charm

44:27.600 --> 44:31.116
anyone on the set and then
he would go home that night and stew

44:31.280 --> 44:35.433
and say, "What kind of Tom am I?
I'm everybody's black pal."

44:35.760 --> 44:38.036
And the next day, he would be mean.

44:38.200 --> 44:42.592
David: Richard was about
13 different personalities.

44:42.760 --> 44:45.753
Nine of them you could deal with.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.913
But the other four
could be a motherfucker now.

44:49.120 --> 44:52.591
Richard was very intense...

44:53.960 --> 44:58.113
about his personal pride.
And he didn't care where it took him.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.960
Michael: There was a huge benefit

45:02.120 --> 45:05.909
for gay pride at the Hollywood Bowl.

45:06.640 --> 45:10.998
A lot of performers
were at the Hollywood Bowl

45:11.160 --> 45:12.640
to lend their support,

45:12.920 --> 45:14.115
Richard being one of them.

45:14.640 --> 45:18.634
David: Richie came on,
and the audience was waiting for him.

45:18.800 --> 45:19.950
Great applause, and he said,

45:20.120 --> 45:23.670
"You know, I've sucked
some cock myself."

45:23.840 --> 45:26.071
That was the first thing
that he said.

45:26.280 --> 45:30.354
I thought, "Uh-oh. Here we go." But
the audience, of course, cheered.

45:30.520 --> 45:34.116
And then he went on
to just really go a little nuts.

45:34.840 --> 45:36.160
(Richard speaking)

45:52.160 --> 45:54.197
They wanted to shock,
because it was the truth.

45:54.360 --> 45:57.319
And the truth defends itself.
And it was quiet.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.673
It was quiet. You could hear a rat
pissing on cotton in Georgia.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.354
I mean, it was real quiet.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.797
(Richard speaking)

46:15.640 --> 46:19.429
Michael: "You all can just kiss
my rich, black ass."

46:19.800 --> 46:23.999
And walked off. So...

46:24.160 --> 46:26.595
Center stage. Hello, everybody.

46:26.880 --> 46:27.880
I'm terribly embarrassed

46:28.040 --> 46:30.760
and I don't know what to say
about what just happened.

46:30.920 --> 46:32.832
But I do think...

46:33.000 --> 46:34.070
(audience chattering)

46:34.240 --> 46:36.880
May I please finish talking?

46:37.040 --> 46:38.190
David: They stood up.

46:38.360 --> 46:42.400
Booing, hissing,
throwing some chairs.

46:42.560 --> 46:46.873
It was the scariest event
that I've ever been at.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.997
Everyone in show business was there.

46:50.200 --> 46:52.669
I thought, "We're never going
to hear from him again."

46:56.080 --> 46:57.594
I got a call from David Franklin,

46:57.760 --> 47:01.231
and he said, "Ce-Ce-Cecil,"
'cause he stuttered.

47:01.440 --> 47:04.911
He said,
"R-Richard fucked up I-last night."

47:05.600 --> 47:08.399
So I drove over to Richard's house,
and nobody was in the house.

47:08.560 --> 47:11.029
I went out, and he was
sitting by a swimming pool.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.874
He was smoking a cigarette,
and he had a scotch

47:14.040 --> 47:16.396
and an orange juice
and vodka was his drink.

47:16.600 --> 47:20.230
And I said, "Man, what happened?"
He said, "Man, fuck it, man."

47:20.440 --> 47:23.911
He said, "I just told them
to kiss my ass." "Man, but why?"

47:24.080 --> 47:26.436
He said,
"If that's the way they want me,

47:26.600 --> 47:28.910
I don't have a career
any damn way."

47:31.640 --> 47:34.917
David: It wasn't Hollywood
that beat him in any way.

47:35.120 --> 47:38.716
He defeated himself
with what his bad habits were.

47:41.936 --> 47:43.096
Reporter: Pryor went to court

47:43.120 --> 47:45.316
because of an incident at home
on New Year's Day.

47:45.600 --> 47:49.071
He's been charged with two counts
of assault with a deadly weapon

47:49.240 --> 47:52.233
and one count of felony
malicious mischief.

47:52.400 --> 47:56.110
I don't want to never see
no more police in my life.

47:56.280 --> 47:57.430
(laughter)

47:57.640 --> 47:58.960
At my house.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.118
Taking my ass to jail.

48:04.440 --> 48:05.635
For killing my car.

48:07.320 --> 48:09.960
I shot the motor. The motor
fell out of the motherfucker.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.679
The motor say, "Fuck it."

48:13.440 --> 48:14.954
Then the police came.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.317
I went into the house.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.513
'Cause they got Magnums too.

48:21.320 --> 48:25.519
And they don't kill cars...
they kill nigg-ah.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.160
(cheering and applause)

48:27.360 --> 48:29.317
Walter: You know, Richard Pryor
was always in the news.

48:29.480 --> 48:31.597
Richard Pryor shoots his car.

48:31.880 --> 48:34.349
Richard Pryor has a heart attack.

48:34.680 --> 48:37.434
He ran into these tragedies
one after another.

48:37.640 --> 48:40.314
But you also knew
that three months would go by

48:40.520 --> 48:42.830
or six months or a year
would go by, and then

48:43.000 --> 48:45.674
he was going to bring
this experience back to you.

48:45.840 --> 48:49.038
Anyone here ever had a heart attack?
Them motherfuckers hurt.

48:50.040 --> 48:53.192
I'm not bullshitting, man.
I was walking in the front yard.

48:53.360 --> 48:56.478
I was just walking along,
and something said, "Don't breathe."

48:58.680 --> 49:00.512
I said, "Huh?"
"You heard me, motherfucker."

49:00.680 --> 49:02.353
I said, 'Don't breathe.' "

49:02.520 --> 49:05.718
"OK, I won't breathe."
"Then shut the fuck up, then."

49:05.920 --> 49:07.354
"OK.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.034
"Don't kill me."

49:09.200 --> 49:12.318
"Get on one knee and prove it."
"I'm on one knee."

49:12.480 --> 49:14.392
"Thinking about dying now,
ain't you?"

49:14.560 --> 49:16.517
"Yeah, I'm thinking
about dying."

49:16.720 --> 49:19.758
"You didn't think about it
when you was eating all that pork."

49:19.920 --> 49:21.320
(laughter)

49:39.280 --> 49:42.876
Rashon: We was on the road
and seen Marie Carter

49:43.080 --> 49:45.231
every day while she was dying.

49:45.400 --> 49:48.074
We'd do the shows,
go check on his grandmother.

49:48.680 --> 49:51.070
She said, "You watch out for my boy."

49:51.240 --> 49:53.118
Jennifer: She was dying,
and basically,

49:53.280 --> 49:54.760
they said,
"You have to get here now."

49:54.880 --> 49:56.439
So we rushed there.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.557
We went into her hospital room.

49:58.760 --> 50:02.390
I remember she touched
his camel-hair coat.

50:02.600 --> 50:05.035
And said, "That's blue azure.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.559
Is it warm enough?"

50:08.400 --> 50:11.074
And he said,
"Yes, Mom, it's warm enough."

50:12.240 --> 50:16.757
We went back to the hotel,
and she died a few hours later.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.799
Richard:
My grandmother Marie used to say:

50:39.280 --> 50:41.431
"They can kill you,
but they can't eat you."

50:43.440 --> 50:44.794
I love you, Grandmother.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.275
Wherever you are.

50:47.640 --> 50:52.112
Jennifer: She was his conduit
to reality, to the world.

50:52.760 --> 50:56.993
To everything that tethered him
to Earth.

50:57.160 --> 51:01.120
And I really think that that's
when he started to come apart.

51:05.920 --> 51:09.038
Rashon: Dr. Al Canning came
and told Richard, he said,

51:09.200 --> 51:10.998
"When you finish going
through this...

51:12.520 --> 51:15.479
...go to Africa. You need to find
out something about yourself."

51:33.840 --> 51:35.433
Richard: I went home
to the motherland.

51:35.600 --> 51:37.398
I was going to find my roots.

51:37.640 --> 51:39.996
700 million black people.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.272
Not one of them motherfuckers
knew me.

51:42.440 --> 51:43.590
(laughter)

51:43.720 --> 51:46.394
I looked in every
phone book in Africa.

51:46.960 --> 51:49.475
I didn't find one goddamn Pryor.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.959
Jennifer:
What he saw was black people

51:52.120 --> 51:53.190
who were walking around.

51:53.360 --> 51:57.354
Everybody was professional, everybody
had their own lives and purpose.

51:57.520 --> 52:00.194
And he felt really at home
on that land.

52:01.200 --> 52:04.193
Richard: I was sitting in the hotel,
and a voice said to me, he said,

52:04.360 --> 52:08.036
"Look around," he said,
"Do you see any niggers?"

52:09.200 --> 52:13.080
I said, "No." "You know why?
'Cause there aren't any."

52:13.760 --> 52:16.832
And it made me think,
"Oh, my God. I've been wrong."

52:17.000 --> 52:21.074
I said, "I ain't going to never
call another black man 'nigger'."

52:21.400 --> 52:23.710
(applause)

52:24.680 --> 52:27.275
He really had this epiphany that

52:27.440 --> 52:29.477
he was never going to use
the word again.

52:30.720 --> 52:35.078
Walter: When he came back, he said,
"I'm not going to use that no more."

52:35.240 --> 52:37.357
And he stuck with it.

52:37.520 --> 52:41.230
When he went to Africa,
the word had no meaning.

52:42.800 --> 52:46.430
But on the streets of Detroit,
it might be something else.

52:46.800 --> 52:49.440
He'd tell the same joke,
just take "nigger" out.

52:49.640 --> 52:51.597
"Oh, he's not funny no more."

52:52.240 --> 52:55.278
So, the punch line
was "nigger" for you all?

52:56.240 --> 52:59.199
And that bothered him that
some people just wouldn't elevate.

53:00.600 --> 53:03.069
Jennifer: He was at such a point
of a growth spurt.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.113
And he didn't want the job.

53:06.920 --> 53:11.199
You know: "I'm a fucking artist. I do
what I do. Leave me the fuck alone."

53:11.600 --> 53:14.593
And shortly thereafter
freebase was introduced.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.390
Kathy: At the time,
everybody was doing cocaine.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.280
We were snorting cocaine.

53:23.080 --> 53:27.757
A lot changed when everybody
switched from snorting cocaine

53:27.920 --> 53:29.639
to freebasing cocaine.

53:30.640 --> 53:34.634
Somehow, everybody knew
that this was a really bad thing,

53:34.800 --> 53:36.519
that turned dark.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.679
Jennifer: And he found freebase.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.950
And after two weeks of watching him
really get addicted to this stuff,

53:44.120 --> 53:46.589
I moved out, because it was clear

53:46.760 --> 53:51.437
the drug had moved in and it had
become his lover, his everything.

53:52.200 --> 53:56.319
And I didn't exist anymore.

53:56.640 --> 54:00.759
Patricia: Richard wasn't an addict.
He was a flat-out, full-blown junkie.

54:00.960 --> 54:05.000
I mean, he might be clean for
four days but be drinking booze.

54:05.480 --> 54:09.440
Be clean for a week
but just snorting a little coke.

54:09.840 --> 54:12.560
So he was not honest with himself.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.989
Patricia: June 9th, 1980.

54:18.560 --> 54:22.839
Richard had walked off the set
of Stir Crazy a few days earlier.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.797
The freebase had been escalating.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.353
He was not able to stop.

54:28.840 --> 54:32.197
Richard was so coked out
that he began

54:32.360 --> 54:35.512
withdrawing large sums of money
out of the bank.

54:35.680 --> 54:41.039
And I'm talking like $500,000,
$100,000, another $250,000.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.039
He was hiding it at his house.

54:44.040 --> 54:45.520
Kathy: Rashon had called.

54:45.680 --> 54:48.718
He was calling and recruiting several
people that he felt were close

54:48.880 --> 54:51.031
enough to Richard
to come to the house.

54:51.320 --> 54:55.075
To rescue Richard,
to try to get Richard to stop.

54:55.360 --> 54:58.000
Richard was in a very scary place.

54:58.160 --> 55:00.834
Richard didn't just have
a couple of ounces of cocaine.

55:01.000 --> 55:05.438
I'm talking about a mound
of cocaine on his bed.

55:05.600 --> 55:06.875
On the bed.

55:07.040 --> 55:11.671
And he had the pipe and the torch,
and he wasn't going to put it down.

55:11.840 --> 55:15.516
You could see that
he was absolutely manic.

55:15.920 --> 55:18.754
When I saw him,
I didn't know him anymore.

55:18.960 --> 55:23.193
He looked like something
had been taken from him.

55:23.920 --> 55:27.596
You know, some spirit
had been ripped out of him.

55:30.040 --> 55:32.157
Rashon: He was high.

55:32.800 --> 55:35.918
We were watching the Vietnam special.

55:36.240 --> 55:41.440
Where they were showing
the monks' protest to the war.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.910
And this particular monk
took gasoline

55:44.080 --> 55:46.311
and poured it on himself
and he lit it.

55:46.480 --> 55:49.791
I said to Richard,
"Look at this man's commitment."

55:49.960 --> 55:52.555
And Richard looked at me and said,

55:53.320 --> 55:56.279
"Fuck his commitment,
he didn't even flinch."

55:57.480 --> 56:00.598
He laughed.
And I went up to go to the kitchen.

56:01.440 --> 56:06.560
On my way back to the room,
a ball of fire is running towards me.

56:07.600 --> 56:09.432
And I just jumped out of the way.

56:09.600 --> 56:12.434
I see it run past me,
and I got up against the wall,

56:12.600 --> 56:14.159
and it run down this long hallway

56:14.320 --> 56:16.994
and then outside,
and then I see it outside, running.

56:17.160 --> 56:18.640
Ball of fire.

56:23.080 --> 56:28.155
In Richard's room before I leave,
there was a fifth of 151 rum.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.792
Three fourths of the bottle was gone.

56:32.280 --> 56:34.670
Thom: I got a call saying
that Richard was

56:34.840 --> 56:37.912
in an ambulance on the way
to the Grossman Burn Center.

56:38.920 --> 56:44.040
I called Dr. Grossman, who I knew.
I said, "This guy is my friend.

56:44.800 --> 56:46.314
Make sure he lives."

56:56.280 --> 57:00.638
Richard: This is my impression
of a heart talking to a brain.

57:01.520 --> 57:05.150
(heart beating)

57:06.000 --> 57:07.673
(as heart) Brain.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.919
(laughter)

57:10.640 --> 57:12.393
Brain.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.153
(as brain) What do you want?

57:19.640 --> 57:21.836
- (heart beating)
- (as heart) You've been naughty.

57:22.080 --> 57:23.434
(laughter)

57:23.680 --> 57:24.909
(brain) Go to hell.

57:27.640 --> 57:30.519
(as heart)
Don't make me angry, brain.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.514
(as brain) Drop dead.

57:37.760 --> 57:40.355
(laughter)

57:55.880 --> 57:58.440
The police had just brought in
a burn victim

57:58.600 --> 58:00.432
who had been running down the street.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.439
And he was awake.

58:02.920 --> 58:08.712
He had burns of his face, neck,
chest, abdomen, back and arms.

58:08.920 --> 58:11.276
That was like 35-40 percent
of his body burnt.

58:11.960 --> 58:16.034
Thom: Dr. Grossman told me that based
on the severe extent of those burns,

58:16.200 --> 58:18.510
there was almost no chance
he would live.

58:19.920 --> 58:24.437
Patricia: I flew back to Los Angeles
and went the Sherman Oaks Burn Center

58:24.640 --> 58:29.112
where everyone else was having
a vigil about Richard.

58:29.280 --> 58:30.760
Kathy: The word kept coming out.

58:30.920 --> 58:32.957
Everybody kept saying
that Richard had died.

58:33.120 --> 58:36.272
David: When he got burned, all
of them showed up at the hospital.

58:36.480 --> 58:39.040
And I had to turn
to a security guard.

58:39.600 --> 58:42.434
I said, "Them bitches
was about to kill people

58:42.600 --> 58:45.115
if you couldn't let them
go to the burn center."

58:48.080 --> 58:49.434
Jennifer: I told the doctors,

58:49.600 --> 58:53.992
"He's on Courvoisier,
he's on vodka, he's on cocaine."

58:54.160 --> 58:58.279
'Cause I knew, you give him morphine,
you could overdose him.

58:58.440 --> 59:00.238
(monitor bleeping)

59:01.280 --> 59:03.112
Thom: On my desk at the studio,

59:03.280 --> 59:05.954
I had a phone that Mr. Wasserman,
the chairman of the company,

59:06.120 --> 59:08.589
used to call me on, and nobody
else used that phone.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.956
- (soft beeping)
- It rang at ten o'clock one morning.

59:11.920 --> 59:15.596
And I said, "Hello,"
and I heard a voice say...

59:16.480 --> 59:18.472
(in a hoarse whispering voice)
Thom.

59:19.320 --> 59:20.754
And I said, "Who's this?"

59:20.920 --> 59:22.798
(in a hoarse whispering voice)
Thom.

59:23.520 --> 59:25.273
And I realized it's Richard.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.589
And he said...

59:28.640 --> 59:30.677
"Am I going to die?"

59:31.720 --> 59:33.951
And I said, "No, Richard,
you're not going to die."

59:34.120 --> 59:35.440
And then he hung up.

59:35.600 --> 59:37.114
And I called Dr. Grossman and said,

59:37.280 --> 59:41.115
"There's a fucking phone
in Richard's room next to his bed."

59:41.720 --> 59:42.720
And he said, "What?"

59:42.880 --> 59:46.112
Comedian Richard Pryor,
critically burned Monday night,

59:46.280 --> 59:48.636
was sitting up
in his hospital bed today

59:48.800 --> 59:50.996
and eating Cream of Wheat
and talking to his doctors.

59:51.160 --> 59:54.995
They said his chance of recovery
was still only about one in three,

59:55.160 --> 59:58.119
but they were more optimistic
than they were yesterday.

59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.314
Interviewer: All day long, I've been
hearing that he's improving.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.039
Is there still a chance he would die?

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.960
I want you to understand
that you have a man who still has

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.231
a 50 percent burns
of third-degree nature...

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.840
...who's very, very sick.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.871
And until all of that burn tissue
is taken off of his body...

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.038
...and covered with grafts, which
will require a number of operations,

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.520
he's going to be that sick.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.715
David: A burn, you know,

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.715
you got to let it form
a scab first before,

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.872
then you got to brush that out.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.880
He was crying like a baby,
rightly so.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.518
And when that guy hit that brush
and did all this here,

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.755
I could see not the pain at that time
but the pain in his life.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.550
That come back.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.518
'Cause he starts talking.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.353
"Mom, I didn't mean to do it.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.751
Mama, I didn't want to do it."

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.709
Skip: Everybody had said
it was freebase. It was an accident.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.230
He said,
"No, no, I did it on purpose.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.713
I poured the rum on myself
and lit myself on fire."

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.632
Now, keep in mind he was high,
so whether it was...

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.438
...an unconscious suicide attempt

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.472
or a conscious suicide attempt,
who knows?

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.871
But he definitely deliberately
set himself on fire.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.638
I just think he was
in a pain at that moment.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.080
And like this monk...

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.474
Committed. But to what,
he don't know.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.311
Whoopi: Junkies are just dumb.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.910
They do dumb shit.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.271
They set themselves on fire.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:37.435
But then I'm sure he went, "What's
that smell? Hey, I think that's me.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.480
"Aargh!" And that's what
he basically says he did.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.400
It's almost like jumping
off a building.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.669
And then you lived.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.274
You fucked up.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.794
But you lived.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.792
I tried to commit suicide.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.275
Interviewer: Intentionally?

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.439
That's all I want to say.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.911
- Next question.
- (interviewer chuckles)

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.275
Interviewer: It didn't work.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.350
Yes, it did.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.037
Interviewer:
You killed the old Richard Pryor?

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.829
Yeah, that person's dead.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.480
He was a horrible man.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.680
Skip: An executive from one
of the studios called me

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.674
and asked me to go see him,
because he needed help.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:37.835
So I flew over to Hana, Maui,
and he came out to greet me.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.477
I could see the burns all over him.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.679
And I was kind of taken aback.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.558
And I remember he looked down,
he said, "Don't worry, my junk is OK.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.995
I still got my junk."

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.513
I thought, "OK!" And I shook
his hand, and we started talking.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.193
And I learned that he was dead
broke, owed money to the IRS.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.794
And he thought his career was over.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.630
What we discovered was there
were a lot of inconsistencies,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.559
financial inconsistencies.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.993
Richard suspected
that David Franklin

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.674
and his lawyers were cheating him.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.114
Jennifer: People came in

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.715
and they uncovered
a lot of these business dealings

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.314
that were crooked.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.877
Richard sued David Franklin.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.917
And got a million dollars back,
but the most important thing

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.710
to Richard was getting
David to apologize to him.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.430
That was more important to Richard
than the million dollars.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.270
Skip: I had to figure out
where he was financially,

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.750
he owed a lot of money
to a lot of people,

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.436
and I came up with an idea
for him to do a concert movie.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.232
Jennifer:
He was really needing to heal.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.360
And the lawyer said to him, "You got
to get back on that horse now,

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.796
it's your time. If you don't do
it now, you're never going to do it.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.713
They're going to forget you."

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.354
The worst thing Richard
could have done was come back.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.995
He wanted to go back to work.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.233
You got to understand something,

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.909
you don't make
Richard Pryor do anything.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.039
Richard Pryor has to want
to do whatever he's doing.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.437
I'm going to see Richard Pryor!

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.280
Yeah!

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.272
He better be funny!

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.434
Tell Richard he better be funny.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.553
Rashon: The who's who of Hollywood,

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.554
they filled the theatre up
at the Palladium.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.951
Then Richard got on stage.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.760
And it was the worst show
I've ever seen him do.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.793
Where was I?

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.317
I was here - what's the date?

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.834
This camera's looking at me.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.400
Audience member: You're doing fine!

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.789
Thank you, brother,
I needed to hear that.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.360
(applause)

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.955
He started doing his act backwards.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.513
And he got confused.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.352
It was rough, and you just knew
it wasn't going to be OK.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.355
(laughter)

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.034
That mother...

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.837
The Lord doesn't want me
to smoke it.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.949
- Audience member: Burn it up.
- Burn it up.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.715
Tough group.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.360
Richard didn't feel
it was a perfect fit.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.038
The audience didn't think it was.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.551
Let me say this to you, this
is honest, this shit didn't work.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.200
For me, I mean...

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.034
I know y'all laugh
at something... I feel...

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.876
I wanted it to be something else
that it's not, it's just not there.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:48.073
It's just there right at this moment
in time and space, for me.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.476
And I hope that nobody feels
cheated or nothing, 'cause at least

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.075
you're getting to see
a motherfucker crucify himself.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.872
He was supposed to do 90 minutes,
he did about an hour.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.360
And walked out.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.392
(audience murmurs)

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.750
(scattered applause)

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.440
I thought
there was going to be a riot.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.554
(audience murmurs)

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.000
He disappeared.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.359
Of course I was concerned,
but I also know Richard.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.831
And I knew how resilient he was.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.751
And I knew that he'd come back.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.431
The next day, same show, same place.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.592
(cheering and applause)

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.799
He was so upset and
he told all the people that,

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.838
"I'm going to
do it all over for you again,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.321
cause I messed the first one up."

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.070
Rev. Jesse Jackson:
He was going back on stage again.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.591
He would be accepted or rejected.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.280
Embraced or pushed aside.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.116
There was something within him
that said, "Go forward."

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.594
The show was flawless.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.798
All my friends know this to be true,
'cause everybody knows me,

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:04.079
I usually, before I go to bed,
I have milk and cookies.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.279
And one night,
I had some low-fat milk...

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.910
...and some pasteurized,
and I mixed them together...

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.914
and I dipped my cookie,
and the shit blew up.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.072
(laughter)

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.234
Paul: The audience went nuts.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.831
I mean, I think the laughter
was at least 15 minutes.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.473
I'll tell you one thing,
when that fire hits your ass...

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.800
that will sober your ass up quick.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.799
(laughter)

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:41.638
I mean, I was standing there on fire
and someone said,

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.315
"Why that's a pretty blue.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:50.279
You know what?
That looks like...Fire!"

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.278
And you know something I found out?

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.592
When you're on fire and running
down the street,

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.474
people will get out of your way.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.190
Except for one old drunk
who's going,

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.317
"Hey, buddy, can I get a light?"

01:08:07.496 --> 01:08:08.976
Johnny Carson:
His latest performance,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.150
Live On The Sunset Strip,

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.880
it had runaway
with the top box office spot.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.713
Made eight million dollars
in three days.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.553
Would you welcome Richard Pryor?

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.948
(applause)

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.680
Reporter: Pryor's firm, headed
by long-time friend Jim Brown,

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.559
entered into a 40 million dollar

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.871
five-year deal
with Columbia Pictures.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.600
Thom: Richard wanted very badly

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.317
to elevate the status
of African-Americans.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.674
Shelia: Indigo was going to
be the first time that a black person

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.517
had a 40 million deal
with a major studio.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.191
And so we were going to do films,
we were going to do this,

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.192
we were going to change the industry.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:56.754
This was going to be it.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.760
Rocco: The phone rang, and he said,
"Rocco, it's Richard.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:02.715
What are you doing?"

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.037
I said, "I'm about
to go to the bathroom."

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.956
He said, "After you take a shit,
come over to Columbia."

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.160
Reporter: Richard Pryor
is getting ready to prepare

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:12.038
for his role in Jo Jo Dancer.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.839
It's a movie written by himself,

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.953
based loosely on incidents
from his own life.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.511
He was an actor and
a producer, and a director,

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:24.115
so Richard became a role model.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:30.760
Michael: He hired Jim Brown
to run the company for him.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.073
I think he made a decision
to have somebody tough,

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.392
but not somebody who really knew
the film business side of it.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.640
Skip: I brought him
the Prince movie, Purple Rain.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.274
And he said, "Great." And then Jim
Brown didn't want to do the movie,

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:53.752
because there wasn't
an all-black crew.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.677
They kind of let a lot
of mistakes happen.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.600
Think that was part of the
reason why that company

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.995
didn't take off.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.279
It was a huge disappointment
for black filmmakers.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.797
He really wanted to be who he was.
He wanted to be an artist.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.112
And it was too much pressure.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.197
Cecil: Richard began this tragic role
where whites came in

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.317
and just gave him white scripts.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.880
And that's what did him in.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.474
Ishmael: I think he appeared in
a movie where he was this kid's toy.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.792
His career, as far as
we were concerned, went downhill.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.595
Richard: I'm doing a film called
Moving for Warner Brothers.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.959
- Interviewer: What's it about?
- About two hours too long.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.870
Skip: Eddie wrote, produced,
was directing Harlem Nights.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.320
But Richard thought he
should have first credit, not Eddie,

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.354
and Eddie was a much bigger
star at that time than Richard.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.834
It was finished then.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.678
The whole thing had been untethered
so long and it never got back.

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.314
Stan: Went to The Comedy Store.
Richard wasn't there.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.196
So I looked at everybody and said,
"Where's Richard?"

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.760
I ran upstairs.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.673
And this comedian...

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.234
had Richard against a wall
with the cocaine...

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.349
...spoon, holding it
to Richard's nose.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.231
I went fucking berserk.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.871
And I put him up against the wall,
and his feet were off the floor.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.869
And I'm choking him
and yelling at Richard,

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.157
"Da fuck is wrong with you?!"

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.911
I went to see him,
and he was back on drugs.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.753
And I could see he was high.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.679
And I said, "Richard...

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.881
...this doesn't work for me.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.516
I'm not going to stand by like
everybody did with John Belushi,

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.830
let you do drugs."

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.398
So I said, "You and I are done
unless you go into rehab."

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.800
Then he sent me a letter firing me
and accusing me of this and this,

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.758
saying I hadn't done this,
hadn't done that,

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.752
all which was a bunch of nonsense.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.113
And he was going back...

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.239
...to a dark place that he couldn't--
I didn't think would come back from.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.314
He kind of tried drying out
for a while and he said...

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.917
He said he was too afraid to go
on stage, he was too vulnerable.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.080
He was really raw.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.680
Rashon: It looked like...

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.753
unlike the fire,
this time he gave up.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.438
You just watched him begin
to deteriorate in front of you.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.760
I felt really bad...

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.752
that, uh...

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.314
That he was going down

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.679
to where I basically tried to help
take him out of. I mean...

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.792
I wanted him to have a good life.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.755
I felt...I felt bad for him.
Not for me.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.961
I think it was very self-destructive
on Richard's part.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.151
I think that was a real
meaningful relationship.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.955
A relationship of substance,
I should say.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.593
That had real connection
and real affection.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.272
And somebody really was
watching out for him.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.880
There weren't a lot of those people.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.759
And sometimes...

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.440
your best isn't good enough.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.354
And you can't...

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.079
save them from themselves.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.629
Paul: I remember I hadn't seen him
for a while.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.516
And I went to some
premiere of something.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.512
And he walked up on me

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.117
and he had lost so much weight
that I really didn't recognize him.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.789
And then it hit me. I said,
"My God, that's Richard."

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.710
I lost 20 pounds to do a film
and I kept losing,

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.519
I couldn't get it back, you know?

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.200
I got real scared, Johnny,
you know, 'cause I was losing weight,

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.673
and my pants were falling down,
and I said, "Something's wrong."

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.511
I said, "All these diseases
around, Richard,

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.239
finally it's caught up with you.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.472
And you have one of them.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.911
And you're going to die."

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.232
So I was very calm about it,
you know, but I'm going to die.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.751
Richard: A few months ago,
I was on The Tonight Show

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.920
talking to Johnny Carson.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.198
And then the next day,
this lady from the newspaper

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.073
called one of my ex-wives and said,

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.390
"What do you think's
wrong with Richard?"

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.756
- She said, "I think he has AIDS."
- (laughter)

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.913
Guaranteeing that I would not get
no pussy until the year 2025.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.555
(laughter)

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.879
Dr. Grossman: One day, he called.
I said, "What's the matter?"

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.079
He said, "I got something wrong
with my eyes, I can't see straight."

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.392
I said, "Come over to the hospital,
I'll get my ophthalmologist."

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.880
They look at him.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.709
The intensivist doctor, neurologist.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.236
And both of them said,
"He may have MS."

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.041
Rashon: When we was doing
Harlem Nights,

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.440
I remember saying to Richie,

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.478
he was getting ready
to go do a scene,

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.838
he had a Bic lighter in his hand.
And I said to him,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.437
"This is a period piece,
they didn't have Bics back then."

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.590
Said he keeps a lighter in his hand
to disguise his fist balling up

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.433
and what was going on with him.

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.512
And that's when he let me
know he had the MS.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.111
Yeah, back in those days, we never
thought it would turn out like that.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.636
Richard: People that have it
know what I mean.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.110
The shit fucks
with your nervous system.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.797
When the doctor tells you you've got
it, and then you go, "Oh, I got it?

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.314
"What is it?"

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.630
"Uh..."

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.153
I'd never heard
a doctor say "Uh," before.

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.318
Richard: It's a blessing, though.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.794
When you can't walk

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.795
and then you have to depend
on others to help you...

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.310
...you have to learn to trust them.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.676
Which is very hard for me.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.869
Very hard.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.232
Patricia: Jennifer came out to handle
his affairs

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.831
when he was unable,
with the MS,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.674
to do that much for himself.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.038
I came back in '94.
The party was over.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.680
No more piles of cocaine.
That craziness was all gone.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.357
Let's put it behind us and make
some lemonade out of the lemons.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.515
Rashon: The drug part of it was over.
He was clean from that point on.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.232
He had really learned whatever
it was to be learned from the MS.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:09.550
Sandy: It was difficult
to visit Richard when he was sick,

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:15.997
after knowing him
as such a wiry, vital,

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:22.552
athletic type, you know,
moving around and never being,

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.760
you know, to all of a sudden
seeing him in a wheelchair.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.434
My dick is dead.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.230
No, it died in my hand.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.435
I had it in my hand,
would beat it...

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.235
and the dick looked at me
like I was crazy.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.551
(laughter)

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.918
(as penis)
"What the fuck's wrong with you?"

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.914
"It's not me, it's you,
motherfucker."

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.912
Jennifer: Even when he got sick,

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.198
I mean, him wanting to be on stage

01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.116
in his declining years, was,

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.120
to me, so heroic.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.040
Warren Beatty's limousine
would show up.

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.717
This make me cry thinking about it.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.270
And he'd be sitting there
looking out at Richard

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.716
and he'd be crying, because...

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.476
because he knew
what a great genius Richard was.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.316
(applause)

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:28.119
Richard Pryor defined the game
of stand-up comedy and comedy itself.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.431
(applause)

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.116
And if you haven't stole
from Richard,

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.953
then you're probably not that funny.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.113
And I wanted to tell him that
I wanted to be just like him,

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.471
except for the drug habit
and failed marriages

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.472
and the temper and the guns.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.195
(applause)

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.314
Mike: As much as people
felt bad for him,

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.996
that man probably had some nights
and some days...

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.790
I mean, it'd take a lifetime
to top that motherfucker's week.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.275
Alan: The last time I saw him,
he was...

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.674
wheelchair-bound and unable to speak.
Jennifer took me to see him.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.158
He couldn't talk. All I could do was,

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.198
you know,
give him a kiss and tell him:

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.113
"I still love you, Richard."

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.830
Richard Pryor died
this afternoon of a heart attack

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.720
at his home in California.
He was 65.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.832
(applause)

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.631
So... what I'm saying, what
the point I'm trying to make is,

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.031
that there is no point to be made.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.635
That's all there is.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.032
There ain't no point to it, 'cause
you didn't ask to come to this,

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.477
motherfucker, and you sure
can't choose how to leave.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.911
'Cause you don't know
when you're going to go.

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.992
Don't take this shit serious.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.870
You better have some fun
and plenty of it.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:57.310
'Cause when the shit over and you
ask for a recharge, it's too late.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.920
So all I can say is keep
some sunshine on your face.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.153
(applause)

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:19.076
David: Even till the end, Richard
never did know how good he was.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.391
Most people did not understand that.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.558
I never heard him said,
"I knocked them off their ass tonight."

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.598
He always said,
"I'll get them tomorrow."

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.597
Jesse: As the song says, we get back
up again because of boundless mercy.

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:37.070
And that you are a champion,
Richard, you are a champion.

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.879
And the ground's no
place for a champion.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.238
So we rise, get up,
go back and do your work.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.918
They've always been
there for Richard.

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.119
He's always there for them.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.713
Richard belongs to us.

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.069
What do you want to be
remembered for?

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.153
I'd like for people...

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.960
to see my picture and laugh.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:04.111
- Just see your picture?
- Yeah.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.593
And laugh
and have stories and tell...

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.433
tell some lies on me.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.390
"He made me laugh."
"I was there, you know?"

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.917
"I was there Wednesday when he drove
up in the..." You know, whatever.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.790
Like that. Like... bring joy.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.952
That's how I'd like to be remembered.
