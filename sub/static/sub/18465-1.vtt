<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

00:30.220 --> 00:33.100
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

00:33.181 --> 00:36.101
<i>'Tis the season to be jolly</i>

00:36.184 --> 00:39.190
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

00:39.270 --> 00:42.150
<i>Don we now our gay apparel</i>

00:42.232 --> 00:45.162
<i>Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la</i>

00:45.235 --> 00:48.105
<i>Troll the ancient Yuletide carol</i>

00:48.196 --> 00:52.026
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

00:52.117 --> 00:54.197
Whoa!

00:56.371 --> 00:59.371
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

00:59.457 --> 01:02.337
Ha-ha. There must be much, much more holly.

01:02.419 --> 01:04.419
<i>'Tis the season to be...</i>

01:04.504 --> 01:05.842
What's this? There's too much holly.

01:05.922 --> 01:08.382
Whoa! Slow down, lad.

01:08.466 --> 01:11.426
<i>Don we now our gay apparel</i>

01:11.511 --> 01:14.141
No, no, no, no more mistletoe.

01:18.768 --> 01:21.958
Chip, away from those presents, dear.

01:22.981 --> 01:26.071
Mama, I found one for me!

01:26.151 --> 01:28.031
Can I open it, Mama? Can I?

01:28.111 --> 01:31.321
- Well, just one.
- Oh, boy!

01:31.614 --> 01:34.750
It's good to see the boy
having a proper Christmas.

01:34.826 --> 01:36.826
Not like last year.

01:36.995 --> 01:40.325
Yes. This is much more agreeable.

01:40.415 --> 01:43.245
Well, I thought last year was quite nice.

01:43.334 --> 01:47.592
Yes, well, I suppose I...
I did manage to save Christmas.

01:47.672 --> 01:50.052
- You?
- Yes, me.

01:50.117 --> 01:53.507
If not for my skillful
and decisive leadership,

01:53.595 --> 01:54.795
all would've been lost.

01:54.888 --> 01:58.728
Leadership? Ha!
You could not lead a horse to water.

01:58.808 --> 02:02.604
What are you yammering about?
It was all my idea.

02:02.687 --> 02:05.607
Your idea? Everyone knows it was mine.

02:05.690 --> 02:10.110
Heavens. How many times are
we going to have to go over this story?

02:10.195 --> 02:14.525
- Story?
- Until someone gets his facts straight.

02:14.616 --> 02:17.446
- Why don't you tell it, Mama?
- Capital idea.

02:17.535 --> 02:19.655
Well, I don't know.

02:19.746 --> 02:21.286
Come now, Mrs. Potts.

02:21.372 --> 02:24.332
Surely you recall how I saved Christmas.

02:25.335 --> 02:26.585
Tut-tut-tut-tut. No leading the witness.

02:26.669 --> 02:29.129
Please, Mama, tell the story.

02:29.214 --> 02:31.469
Oh, all right.

02:31.549 --> 02:35.598
Ah! Now we will hear what really happened.

02:35.678 --> 02:37.758
Well, let's see.

02:37.847 --> 02:40.927
Belle, terrified by the master's anger,

02:41.017 --> 02:42.637
ran away from the castle

02:42.727 --> 02:46.307
straight into a pack of wolves.

02:46.397 --> 02:48.977
But the master saved her.

02:49.067 --> 02:51.027
<i>They began to be friends.</i>

02:51.110 --> 02:52.400
<i>Ah-ah-ah.</i>

02:52.487 --> 02:54.907
<i>That's where I came in.</i>

02:56.407 --> 02:59.487
- Where could he be?
- Goodness knows.

02:59.577 --> 03:02.117
We've searched every last corner.

03:02.205 --> 03:05.705
I'm beginning to think
he's not in the castle at all.

03:07.836 --> 03:10.046
<i>Voilà!</i> There he is!

03:10.129 --> 03:12.919
- Wonderful!
- No time to waste.

03:13.007 --> 03:14.877
We must find a way to get them together.

03:14.968 --> 03:17.798
Let's go! Love will not wait.

03:17.887 --> 03:21.267
You really think she's the one?
Will she break the spell?

03:21.349 --> 03:23.849
I knew it from the moment
I set eyes on her.

03:23.935 --> 03:28.475
If anyone can reach the master,
Belle can. Such a kind soul.

03:29.065 --> 03:31.415
And her looks don't hurt either.

03:31.484 --> 03:33.284
Wait for me!

03:41.661 --> 03:44.501
- Hi, Belle.
- Oh, hello.

03:45.039 --> 03:47.289
Chip, do you know what day it is?

03:47.375 --> 03:50.915
Well, it's not Tuesday...

03:51.004 --> 03:54.719
No, silly. Today is December 24th.

03:54.799 --> 03:58.969
- The day before Christmas.
- And what a beautiful day it is.

03:59.053 --> 04:01.851
A wonderful day for a morning stroll.

04:01.931 --> 04:05.980
Yes, yes. Nothing starts the day
like a brisk walk around the grounds.

04:06.060 --> 04:08.608
Yeah! Or you could go ice-skating.

04:08.688 --> 04:11.578
- Ha-ha. Wahoo!
- Yes, fresh air, exercise. Ha-ha.

04:11.665 --> 04:13.525
In moderation, of course.

04:13.794 --> 04:17.408
Come along, Belle, dear.
The great outdoors awaits.

04:17.488 --> 04:19.447
Yeah, let's go!

04:28.541 --> 04:30.251
Oh. Good morning.

04:30.335 --> 04:32.845
Huh? Whoa...

04:34.839 --> 04:37.509
Oh, dear. Are you all right?

04:38.301 --> 04:40.391
Uh... Uh...

04:42.138 --> 04:47.268
I fell and I landed on my...
On... On the ice.

04:47.352 --> 04:49.352
It's pretty slippery.

04:49.771 --> 04:52.611
Yes, it's slippery.

04:53.524 --> 04:56.034
This is a perfect day for skating.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.071
Come on.

04:59.697 --> 05:00.947
Hmm?

05:01.866 --> 05:03.486
Come on.

05:03.576 --> 05:04.946
No.

05:06.788 --> 05:11.078
- Go on, Master. It might be fun.
- Go for it!

05:11.167 --> 05:13.127
Hmm. Hmm?

05:15.546 --> 05:17.216
- Come on!
- Not so fast.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.880
Ooo-ooo la-la.

05:20.051 --> 05:22.891
Come on. Why don't you try it like this?

05:22.971 --> 05:27.731
One, two, three. One, two, three.
See? It's easy.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.150
One, two, three.

05:32.230 --> 05:35.360
One, two, three.

05:35.566 --> 05:36.606
Ho-ho-ho.

05:36.693 --> 05:39.282
Yes, I think this may work.

06:03.553 --> 06:07.183
Bravo! Bravo! Encore!

06:09.142 --> 06:12.022
Fife, you approve?

06:12.103 --> 06:15.063
Oh, Maestro, it's magnificent!

06:15.148 --> 06:18.398
Oh, come along. It's merely an opera

06:20.695 --> 06:24.525
to bring the house down.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.700
Is there a part for a piccolo?

06:29.787 --> 06:31.947
Absolutely.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.510
Solo for Fife in B-flat.

06:41.591 --> 06:45.641
- Ooh. I'd do anything for a solo.
- Yes.

06:46.637 --> 06:50.097
I know. Now, Fifey,

06:50.183 --> 06:52.353
in the midst of my crescendo,

06:52.435 --> 06:56.015
I thought I heard merriment
outside the window.

06:56.105 --> 06:58.565
Have a little look-see, will you?

07:00.818 --> 07:03.738
Wow! Would you look at that?

07:03.821 --> 07:07.531
Well, I think I might.
I'll just pick myself up and...

07:07.617 --> 07:08.617
Oh!

07:08.701 --> 07:11.331
What's this? Heavens, look.

07:11.412 --> 07:14.018
I'm bolted to the wall!

07:14.098 --> 07:15.988
Oh, right.

07:17.460 --> 07:20.420
Um, the master is skating.

07:20.505 --> 07:24.085
Skating? Why on earth
would he do a thing like that?

07:24.175 --> 07:27.255
Probably because that
pretty girl is holding his hand.

07:27.345 --> 07:29.805
- What? Belle?
- Hey.

07:30.389 --> 07:34.139
Maybe if she falls in love with him,
the spell will be broken,

07:34.227 --> 07:36.397
and we'll be human again!

07:38.356 --> 07:40.266
Trust me, Fife.

07:40.358 --> 07:43.858
Humanity is entirely overrated.

07:43.945 --> 07:46.775
Before the enchantment, there was no need

07:46.864 --> 07:50.544
for my particular brand of genius.

07:51.035 --> 07:54.285
But now the master needs my melodies

07:54.372 --> 07:57.132
to feed his tormented soul.

07:57.708 --> 08:00.248
I am his confidant

08:00.878 --> 08:02.878
and his best friend.

08:03.756 --> 08:08.896
And I won't let some peasant girl
ruin it for me!

08:08.986 --> 08:13.136
Fife, see to it that this blossoming love

08:13.224 --> 08:15.524
withers on the vine.

08:16.061 --> 08:18.061
Yes, Maestro Forte.

08:19.397 --> 08:21.517
One, two, three.

08:21.607 --> 08:24.737
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

08:24.819 --> 08:26.739
I think I've got it!

08:32.493 --> 08:34.749
Hey, down in front. I wanna see.

08:34.828 --> 08:37.249
Let me see. I wanna see, too!

08:40.960 --> 08:44.169
Quiet. Oh, this is very promising.

08:44.255 --> 08:46.755
Ah, yes, there is something in the air.

08:47.341 --> 08:49.138
Could it be love?

08:49.218 --> 08:51.178
Love? Oh, oh, oh, ooh.

08:51.262 --> 08:52.932
Uh. Oh. Oh.

08:53.014 --> 08:54.644
I've got to stop them.

08:54.724 --> 08:55.734
Oh!

08:58.102 --> 09:00.522
Help!

09:00.938 --> 09:03.608
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

09:03.858 --> 09:06.028
What's that little toot up to?

09:06.110 --> 09:07.610
Whoa!

09:13.326 --> 09:15.366
Mmm-mmm.

09:17.455 --> 09:19.235
Stop!

09:38.226 --> 09:41.016
It's a Christmas angel, see?

09:46.317 --> 09:48.357
This is no angel.

09:48.819 --> 09:52.059
It's the shadow of a monster.

09:59.413 --> 10:02.673
Oh, Forte is going to be so proud of me.

10:06.963 --> 10:09.263
I don't know why I bother.

10:11.008 --> 10:13.088
Now he's worse than ever.

10:13.594 --> 10:15.854
Don't lose heart, dearest.

10:29.986 --> 10:32.837
I hate Christmas.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.710
The music helps?

10:45.793 --> 10:50.009
Your music is the only thing
that helps me forget.

10:50.089 --> 10:52.629
Don't worry, old friend.

10:52.717 --> 10:55.007
I'm here for you,

10:55.094 --> 10:57.433
just as I have been,

10:57.513 --> 11:00.223
just as I always will be.

11:01.892 --> 11:03.981
Why is the beast such a grump?

11:04.061 --> 11:06.651
I don't know. He's always like that.

11:07.398 --> 11:09.728
- Even at Christmas?
- Yep.

11:10.651 --> 11:13.321
Belle, what's Christmas?

11:13.404 --> 11:15.824
Oh, Chip, you must know about Christmas.

11:15.906 --> 11:19.326
Stockings in front of the fire? Tree?

11:19.410 --> 11:21.790
Tinsel? Presents?

11:21.871 --> 11:23.911
Presents? Do I get one?

11:24.540 --> 11:27.500
Of course. Everyone gets
a present on Christmas.

11:27.585 --> 11:31.005
- Oh, even the master?
- Yes, even the master.

11:31.088 --> 11:34.338
- What are you gonna get him?
- I don't really know him well enough

11:34.425 --> 11:36.505
to know what he would want.

11:36.594 --> 11:40.810
- What would you want?
- Well, what I love most

11:40.890 --> 11:44.600
in the world are my books, my stories.

11:44.685 --> 11:47.185
Why don't you get the master a story?

11:47.271 --> 11:50.611
You're right, Chip. A story.

11:52.943 --> 11:55.950
<i>When I get to know him</i>

11:56.030 --> 11:59.410
<i>We'll find more things to say</i>

11:59.492 --> 12:02.540
<i>One day I will reach him</i>

12:02.620 --> 12:06.040
<i>There has to be a way</i>

12:06.123 --> 12:09.003
<i>Everyone needs someone</i>

12:09.085 --> 12:12.415
<i>He must need someone, too</i>

12:12.505 --> 12:15.755
<i>When I get to know him better</i>

12:17.426 --> 12:19.386
<i>Here's what I will do</i>

12:20.554 --> 12:23.352
<i>I'll read him stories</i>

12:23.432 --> 12:26.812
<i>From picture books all filled with wonder</i>

12:26.894 --> 12:29.859
<i>Magic worlds where the impossible</i>

12:29.939 --> 12:33.109
<i>Becomes the everyday</i>

12:33.192 --> 12:36.362
<i>We'll find a mountaintop</i>

12:36.445 --> 12:39.565
<i>And some moonbeams to sit under</i>

12:39.657 --> 12:45.867
<i>I'll lead because I know the way</i>

12:45.955 --> 12:49.075
<i>So much to discover</i>

12:49.166 --> 12:52.456
<i>I do it all the time</i>

12:52.545 --> 12:55.585
<i>I could live inside bright pages</i>

12:55.673 --> 12:58.633
<i>Where the words all rhyme</i>

12:58.717 --> 13:01.467
<i>We will slay the dragons</i>

13:01.554 --> 13:04.762
<i>That still follow him around</i>

13:04.849 --> 13:08.269
<i>And he'll smile, yes, he'll smile</i>

13:08.352 --> 13:11.522
<i>As his dreams leave the ground</i>

13:11.605 --> 13:14.475
<i>Stories and stories</i>

13:14.567 --> 13:18.027
<i>About mermaids, kings and sunken treasure</i>

13:18.112 --> 13:21.160
<i>Magic worlds where the impossible</i>

13:21.240 --> 13:24.700
<i>Becomes the everyday</i>

13:24.785 --> 13:27.955
<i>I know a tiny place</i>

13:28.038 --> 13:31.288
<i>Just a dot too small to measure</i>

13:31.375 --> 13:33.335
<i>I'll take him there</i>

13:33.419 --> 13:37.629
<i>I know the way</i>

13:37.715 --> 13:40.885
<i>Stories about heroes</i>

13:40.968 --> 13:44.638
<i>Who overcame their deepest sorrow</i>

13:44.722 --> 13:47.770
<i>They'll put hope into his heart again</i>

13:47.850 --> 13:51.270
<i>He'll cherish every day</i>

13:51.353 --> 13:54.652
<i>He'll find a better world</i>

13:54.732 --> 13:58.072
<i>And the strength to face tomorrow</i>

13:58.152 --> 14:04.161
<i>I'm sure that when he knows the way</i>

14:04.241 --> 14:06.451
<i>He'll want</i>

14:06.535 --> 14:12.915
<i>To stay</i>

14:18.881 --> 14:21.841
Do you think the master
will like his gift?

14:21.926 --> 14:23.006
I do.

14:23.093 --> 14:26.123
So does this mean
we're gonna have a Christmas?

14:26.204 --> 14:28.144
Uh-huh. Absolutely.

14:28.307 --> 14:30.477
Absolutely not.

14:30.559 --> 14:32.519
Why not?

14:32.603 --> 14:36.861
Out of the question. Not a chance.
Dream on. An impossibility. Forget it.

14:38.441 --> 14:40.651
Come on!

14:40.736 --> 14:42.146
Suck in that gut.

14:42.238 --> 14:46.448
<i>Mon ami</i>. Get with the spirit. Unwind.

14:46.534 --> 14:49.498
- Oh, dear.
- Come on, love. Have a heart.

14:49.578 --> 14:52.868
Yeah. Come on.

14:52.957 --> 14:57.287
- No, no, and... Let me think...
- Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

14:57.378 --> 14:58.958
No!

14:59.046 --> 15:01.836
This is where I put my foot down.

15:02.216 --> 15:04.336
Wait. Get out of...

15:04.802 --> 15:08.262
The master has forbidden Christmas!

15:08.347 --> 15:09.717
Oh, dear.

15:09.807 --> 15:11.557
Forbid Christmas?

15:11.642 --> 15:13.892
No one can forbid Christmas.

15:13.978 --> 15:16.148
He doesn't wish
to be reminded of his past,

15:16.230 --> 15:19.820
and Christmas is
a most painful reminder of it.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.740
I, for one, do not wish to torture him.

15:22.820 --> 15:26.070
I, for one, think a little Christmas
cheer would do him some good.

15:26.156 --> 15:27.776
- Yeah.
- Oh? Hmm.

15:28.325 --> 15:32.245
The girl is right.
It is up to us to do something.

15:32.329 --> 15:35.499
Gosh! It's not our place to get involved.

15:35.583 --> 15:39.590
No, no, no, no! We just can't
mind our own beeswax, can we?

15:39.670 --> 15:43.550
Just have to stick our wick
where it doesn't belong.

15:55.728 --> 15:58.898
- Oh, humiliating.
- Pish posh.

15:58.981 --> 16:01.151
I think it's a wonderful idea.

16:01.233 --> 16:05.741
But the master doesn't want it.
His castle, his rules.

16:05.821 --> 16:07.781
It's not fair.

16:07.865 --> 16:11.945
He's right. It's not fair!

16:12.036 --> 16:14.406
Don't whine, glasses.

16:14.496 --> 16:17.036
Sorry.

16:17.124 --> 16:20.589
Look at us, squabbling and bickering.

16:20.669 --> 16:23.299
Breaks my heart to see it, it does.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.300
And we used to be at our very best
at Christmas.

16:26.383 --> 16:30.641
Why, we used to prepare
a feast for the entire castle.

16:30.721 --> 16:34.061
Ah! You could have some stuffed turkey.

16:34.141 --> 16:36.771
- Cranberry sauce.
- Shortbread cookies.

16:36.852 --> 16:38.899
- Mince pies.
- Potatoes.

16:38.979 --> 16:41.149
- Gravy.
- And Christmas pudding!

16:41.231 --> 16:44.691
Uh, pudding? With... With custard?

16:44.777 --> 16:48.987
What do you think we are, barbarians?
Of course with custard.

16:49.073 --> 16:51.743
And raisins and brandy,

16:51.825 --> 16:54.405
and all those things you like.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.955
- All right.
- Yes!

17:02.044 --> 17:05.384
But if the master finds out about this,
he will be furious,

17:05.464 --> 17:08.344
so, everybody, keep quiet.

17:08.425 --> 17:11.464
Come on!
What are we waiting for, Christmas?

17:11.553 --> 17:14.101
Good heavens, we don't have
much time. It's Christmas Eve!

17:14.181 --> 17:17.911
- I'll see to the dinner.
- I'll get some mistletoe.

17:18.076 --> 17:19.846
We need to brighten this place up.

17:19.936 --> 17:22.227
Belle, I know someone who will help.

17:22.314 --> 17:26.243
Now, now, wait for me.
I'm in charge here. I'm in charge.

17:27.944 --> 17:29.945
Wait for me!

17:31.323 --> 17:34.743
One-thousand one, one-thousand two,

17:34.827 --> 17:36.697
one-thousand three...

17:36.787 --> 17:40.287
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

17:40.374 --> 17:43.464
Oh, boy, there sure
are a lot of stairs here.

17:43.544 --> 17:46.342
One-thousand seven, one-thousand eight,

17:46.422 --> 17:49.452
one-thousand nine, one-thousand ten...

17:57.766 --> 17:59.136
Hello?

17:59.852 --> 18:01.192
Hello?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.730
Do not be afraid, <i>mes amis.</i>

18:05.816 --> 18:09.986
It is I, Lumiere.
We have come to pay you a little visit.

18:14.491 --> 18:17.581
- Lumiere?
- Angelique.

18:18.162 --> 18:21.460
Ah, Lumiere, finally.

18:21.540 --> 18:24.840
I thought we were to be locked away
in this dusty attic forever.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.670
Ah, Angelique, <i>mon amour.</i>

18:29.089 --> 18:33.259
Your eyes are still so lovely
after all these years.

18:33.343 --> 18:35.263
Lumiere, please!

18:35.345 --> 18:37.635
You'll tarnish the halo.

18:38.849 --> 18:42.139
Oh, yes. This is Belle, our guest.

18:42.227 --> 18:46.017
- Pleased to meet you.
- And this is Angelique.

18:46.106 --> 18:48.066
She is the castle decorator.

18:48.150 --> 18:50.780
You mean was the castle decorator.

18:50.861 --> 18:54.451
I am not responsible
for this baroque atrocity.

18:54.531 --> 18:56.578
When I was in charge,

18:56.658 --> 19:00.578
the castle was full of light and beauty.

19:00.662 --> 19:03.832
But, <i>chérie,</i> that is why we have come.

19:03.916 --> 19:06.536
Gather around, <i>mes enfants.</i>

19:06.627 --> 19:12.469
We are planning the greatest
Christmas celebration ever.

19:20.808 --> 19:22.638
No, stop!

19:23.726 --> 19:24.806
What is it, <i>chérie?</i>

19:24.895 --> 19:27.015
Why do you raise my hopes...

19:27.105 --> 19:31.815
I... I mean, their hopes...
Only to have them dashed?

19:31.902 --> 19:34.072
Well, no more.

19:35.531 --> 19:37.031
But it's Christmas Eve.

19:37.115 --> 19:40.075
Without you, we'll never get
the castle decorated in time.

19:40.160 --> 19:44.750
Ha! Christmas? Hmph!
I refuse to hope for it anymore.

19:44.832 --> 19:46.962
I will not be disappointed again.

19:47.042 --> 19:50.132
But this is to be
the greatest celebration ever.

19:50.212 --> 19:52.342
We cannot do it without you.

19:52.422 --> 19:56.052
Well, but of course you cannot.

19:56.134 --> 19:59.099
Christmas takes planning and organization.

19:59.179 --> 20:04.059
No. No, I won't do it.
It won't change anything.

20:04.142 --> 20:06.192
I believe it will.

20:06.937 --> 20:09.897
<i>There is more to</i>

20:09.982 --> 20:12.732
<i>This time of year</i>

20:12.818 --> 20:16.448
<i>Than sleigh bells and holly</i>

20:16.530 --> 20:19.828
<i>Mistletoe and snow</i>

20:19.908 --> 20:22.788
<i>Those things come and go</i>

20:22.870 --> 20:26.040
<i>Much deeper than snow</i>

20:26.123 --> 20:31.840
<i>Stronger than the strongest love
we'll know</i>

20:31.920 --> 20:35.818
<i>We'll ever know</i>

20:40.888 --> 20:45.178
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

20:45.267 --> 20:49.397
<i>I truly believe</i>

20:49.479 --> 20:53.689
<i>That hope is the greatest</i>

20:53.775 --> 20:58.195
<i>Of the gifts we'll receive</i>

20:58.280 --> 21:02.410
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

21:02.492 --> 21:06.542
<i>We'll all be just fine</i>

21:06.622 --> 21:10.502
<i>A star shines above us</i>

21:10.584 --> 21:14.844
<i>Lighting your way and mine</i>

21:17.007 --> 21:21.177
<i>Just as long as there's Christmas
there will be Christmas pud</i>

21:21.595 --> 21:22.595
<i>Tons of turkey</i>

21:22.679 --> 21:25.269
<i>And cranberry sauce and mince pies
if we're good</i>

21:25.349 --> 21:29.479
<i>- Lots of logs on the fire
- Lots of gifts on the tree</i>

21:29.561 --> 21:31.771
<i>All wrapped up in red ribbons</i>

21:31.855 --> 21:33.815
<i>Wonder if there's one for me</i>

21:33.899 --> 21:37.989
<i>We're due for a party
Where on earth do we start</i>

21:38.070 --> 21:42.119
<i>I may wear my tiara
you bought me in Montmartre</i>

21:42.199 --> 21:44.369
<i>All the silver will sparkle</i>

21:44.451 --> 21:46.451
<i>And the china will gleam</i>

21:46.536 --> 21:50.786
<i>And we'll be as shiny
as a brand-new centime</i>

21:50.874 --> 21:54.923
<i>- After dinner we'll play games
- Till the morning breaks through</i>

21:55.003 --> 21:56.800
<i>Then we'll meet in the garden</i>

21:56.880 --> 21:59.760
<i>- This is what we shall do</i>
- <i>We will build</i>

21:59.841 --> 22:03.301
<i>We will build a snowman
that'll reach to the sky</i>

22:03.387 --> 22:07.847
<i>It will stay up until July</i>

22:17.776 --> 22:20.236
What are you doing? Stop, stop, stop.

22:20.320 --> 22:24.119
Put me down. Put me down.
This is ridiculous.

22:24.199 --> 22:27.369
Everyone knows that
the lights go on first.

22:29.579 --> 22:32.789
I don't want to go
all the way up there on the top.

22:32.874 --> 22:36.714
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

22:36.795 --> 22:40.665
<i>I truly believe</i>

22:40.757 --> 22:44.797
<i>That hope is the greatest</i>

22:44.886 --> 22:48.766
<i>Of the gifts we'll receive</i>

22:48.849 --> 22:52.809
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

22:52.894 --> 22:56.818
<i>We'll all be just fine</i>

22:56.898 --> 23:03.608
<i>There'll always be Christmas</i>

23:03.947 --> 23:08.987
<i>So there always will be a time</i>

23:09.077 --> 23:11.157
<i>When the world</i>

23:11.246 --> 23:14.366
<i>Is filled with peace</i>

23:14.458 --> 23:20.088
<i>And warmth</i>

23:21.840 --> 23:24.470
We're gonna have
the greatest Christmas ever.

23:24.551 --> 23:26.971
Oh, I hope so, Chip.

23:29.639 --> 23:32.099
You on the left,
you on the right, follow me.

23:32.184 --> 23:34.439
There is decorating to be done.

23:34.519 --> 23:38.979
Yes, yes, yes, yes. But keep in mind,
the master mustn't find out.

23:40.650 --> 23:43.280
Ooh, yes.

23:44.696 --> 23:48.156
Christmas? She's planning Christmas?

23:48.408 --> 23:51.908
Yes. Awful, isn't it?

24:00.253 --> 24:02.923
Perhaps she doesn't know
how I feel about Christmas.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.046
- But she does know.
- Hmm?

24:05.133 --> 24:08.973
She just doesn't care like I do.

24:11.139 --> 24:13.679
She's actually trying to bring
Christmas back to the castle.

24:13.767 --> 24:18.147
And you know how much
we despise Christmas.

24:18.230 --> 24:20.690
The day my life ended.

24:23.026 --> 24:26.946
- Bring me my presents!
- Your Highness,

24:27.030 --> 24:30.910
please accept this humble gift
as a token of our appreciation.

24:30.992 --> 24:33.248
I know I speak for everyone when...

24:33.328 --> 24:35.458
Ah, just give it to me!

24:36.748 --> 24:40.458
A storybook? You call this a present?

24:40.544 --> 24:43.592
I hope you have something
better for me, Forte.

24:43.672 --> 24:46.682
Yes, sir. Of course, master.

24:51.513 --> 24:53.183
What is that?

24:53.265 --> 24:57.305
Um, a small piece in your honor, master.

24:57.644 --> 25:01.474
Ew! I hate it.
Forte, that stuff is gloomy.

25:04.734 --> 25:07.244
Who disturbs my Christmas?

25:08.989 --> 25:11.279
Please, take this rose

25:11.366 --> 25:15.696
in exchange for shelter
from the bitter cold.

25:17.346 --> 25:21.069
I don't need a rose.
Go away, you wretched old hag!

25:24.254 --> 25:28.844
You have been deceived
by your own cold heart.

25:28.925 --> 25:32.385
A curse upon your house and all within it.

25:33.597 --> 25:37.597
Until you have found one
to love you as you are,

25:37.684 --> 25:41.774
you shall remain forever a beast.

25:50.864 --> 25:53.744
But we've come so far since then.

25:53.825 --> 25:57.535
We've risen above the tragedy.

25:57.621 --> 26:00.210
Where is she?

26:00.290 --> 26:03.670
I believe she's gone to the boiler room,

26:03.752 --> 26:06.922
or so, a little birdie told me.

26:08.230 --> 26:10.900
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

26:32.572 --> 26:34.492
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Get out of the way.

26:34.574 --> 26:36.454
We're workin' here.

26:37.035 --> 26:40.535
- Excuse me.
- Let's go. Let's go.

26:40.622 --> 26:43.670
All right, you guys.
Now, get back to work.

26:43.750 --> 26:46.490
The castle doesn't heat itself, you know.

26:47.587 --> 26:50.087
So, what can I do you for, lady?

26:50.173 --> 26:53.430
- I'm looking for a log.
- All right. Logs we got.

26:53.510 --> 26:56.600
What do you want? Hard wood?
Soft wood? We got it all.

26:56.680 --> 26:59.220
We got birch, maple, pine, oak...

27:00.107 --> 27:04.019
Concrete. My head. Don't worry. It'll pass.

27:04.104 --> 27:06.274
So, make up your mind already.

27:06.356 --> 27:09.106
Is it all right if I just browse?

27:09.192 --> 27:12.492
Suit yourself. Take your time.
Me, I got work to do.

27:30.505 --> 27:33.005
Hey, what am I payin' you for,
being boring?

27:33.091 --> 27:36.221
Do that on your own time. Get out of here!

27:37.971 --> 27:39.351
Yes.

27:50.817 --> 27:52.737
What are you hiding?

28:00.410 --> 28:02.700
It's a Yule log.

28:02.912 --> 28:04.000
Huh?

28:04.080 --> 28:05.750
A... A Yule log.

28:06.666 --> 28:09.036
It's a wonderful tradition.

28:09.127 --> 28:12.417
One log is chosen and everyone
in the house touches it

28:12.505 --> 28:14.665
and makes a Christmas wish.

28:15.091 --> 28:17.431
Mmm, wishes are stupid.

28:19.304 --> 28:22.519
You made a Christmas wish last year.

28:22.599 --> 28:25.949
Is this what you wished for?

28:29.773 --> 28:30.983
No.

28:33.151 --> 28:35.281
But I will keep wishing.

28:35.695 --> 28:37.655
And when the log is burned
on Christmas morning...

28:37.739 --> 28:39.619
There will be no Christmas.

28:39.699 --> 28:44.369
- But...
- No! I am the master here.

28:44.454 --> 28:47.168
How can you be so selfish?

28:47.248 --> 28:50.338
You cannot possibly understand.

28:50.418 --> 28:53.668
You have no idea
what it's like to lose everything,

28:53.755 --> 28:55.915
to be trapped in your own castle,

28:56.007 --> 28:58.297
to be a... A... A...

28:58.385 --> 28:59.795
Prisoner?

29:01.596 --> 29:05.056
The only one holding us prisoner here
is you.

29:05.141 --> 29:07.231
Well, I'm not giving up.

29:12.482 --> 29:14.152
Prisoner.

29:33.670 --> 29:36.420
Hiya, Belle. You should see the ballroom.

29:36.506 --> 29:39.086
It's all decorated and pretty
and there's garlands everywhere.

29:39.175 --> 29:41.085
I think the master's gonna
be really excited

29:41.177 --> 29:43.257
when he finds out about Christmas.

29:43.346 --> 29:46.426
Well, he... He already knows.

29:46.516 --> 29:49.266
Really? Was he excited?

29:49.352 --> 29:52.522
Actually, Chip, he's forbidden it.

29:53.565 --> 29:57.355
But I thought
he couldn't forbid Christmas.

29:58.695 --> 30:01.445
You know, Chip, he can't.

30:01.531 --> 30:03.870
We'll have Christmas with or without him.

30:03.950 --> 30:09.080
Hurray! Can we get a tree now, Belle?
It's the only thing we're missing.

30:09.164 --> 30:12.134
All right, then. Let's go get a tree.

30:12.625 --> 30:14.205
But first...

30:15.211 --> 30:16.381
Shh.

30:26.848 --> 30:30.308
Psst, Belle. The master. Hurry.

30:51.498 --> 30:53.418
What about this one?

31:03.092 --> 31:07.152
Nah, too skinny. Come on.

31:19.484 --> 31:20.904
Ooo la-la.

31:22.362 --> 31:26.322
- Ohh, Lumiere.
- She's beautiful, no?

31:26.407 --> 31:29.037
Yes, and I'm hideous.

31:29.118 --> 31:31.408
Not to mention ill-tempered.

31:31.496 --> 31:34.806
What? What is that?

31:34.891 --> 31:37.871
Ooh, it looks like a Christmas present.

31:45.802 --> 31:48.302
Oh-ho-ho. It's for you, master.

31:48.388 --> 31:50.968
It's from a girl.

31:53.142 --> 31:56.312
- Mrs. Potts?
- No. From Belle.

31:57.981 --> 31:59.321
Belle?

32:02.777 --> 32:05.237
Uh-uh-uh. Master, you can't open it.

32:05.321 --> 32:07.701
Well, why not? It's for me, isn't it?

32:07.782 --> 32:10.079
Because it's not yet Christmas.

32:11.661 --> 32:16.371
Master, we all understand
how you feel about Christmas.

32:16.457 --> 32:21.247
But when a woman gives a man a gift,
she's saying, "I care about you."

32:21.379 --> 32:22.549
Hmm.

32:22.630 --> 32:24.590
But I don't have a gift for her.

32:24.674 --> 32:26.729
It is not too late.

32:28.469 --> 32:32.139
Well, I guess I could
get her a little something.

32:37.103 --> 32:39.442
Forte, stop the noise!

32:39.522 --> 32:42.192
Noise? Noise?

32:42.734 --> 32:44.714
This is my masterpiece.

32:45.862 --> 32:47.452
Master.

32:48.573 --> 32:50.620
I... I want you to compose a song.

32:50.700 --> 32:54.040
- It's a present for Belle.
- What? Belle?

32:55.204 --> 32:57.834
And make it happy!

32:57.915 --> 33:01.875
Oh, but happiness is so depressing.

33:02.503 --> 33:05.633
What's next? Love songs?

33:07.508 --> 33:09.718
Wedding marches?

33:11.638 --> 33:15.138
It's all that girl's fault.

33:17.518 --> 33:19.308
What about this one?

33:19.395 --> 33:24.275
- Hmm, too wiggly.
- Too wiggly.

33:24.359 --> 33:25.488
Fife!

33:28.446 --> 33:29.606
Pay attention.

33:29.697 --> 33:34.407
I need you to pace when I think.
The girl is evil, I tell you.

33:34.494 --> 33:36.624
She pulls him from my grasp.

33:36.704 --> 33:39.334
She fills his head with dreams of love

33:39.415 --> 33:42.125
and hope and Christmas!

33:42.210 --> 33:45.800
Well, what you gonna do?
You can't stop Christmas.

33:45.880 --> 33:50.890
No, but I can stop the girl.

33:54.889 --> 33:58.429
Chip, this is the last one.

33:58.518 --> 34:02.398
That's not it. That's just a weed
wishing it was a tree.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.860
Chip, we've looked
at every tree on the grounds.

34:05.942 --> 34:08.697
But it's more this way than that.

34:08.777 --> 34:10.658
It will have to do.

34:13.574 --> 34:16.454
- What a headache I have.
- I'm sorry.

34:16.536 --> 34:18.326
I... I'll get a saw.

34:18.413 --> 34:21.460
No, that's fine.
I don't want I should put you out.

34:21.541 --> 34:23.251
Oh, all right.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.551
Do you have some oil?
I just thought a little massage...

34:28.630 --> 34:31.551
But if it's no, it's no. Go on.
What are you waiting for?

34:31.634 --> 34:33.764
Knock yourself out.

34:34.721 --> 34:36.931
You never get headaches, I guess.
Lucky you.

34:37.014 --> 34:40.313
- Really, I can get a saw.
- Who wants a saw?

34:40.393 --> 34:43.733
I said go ahead with the whacking
and the hitting. Who's stopping you?

34:45.690 --> 34:47.480
What is that?

34:54.322 --> 34:55.493
Ohh.

34:56.409 --> 34:58.449
It's beautiful.

35:02.165 --> 35:06.175
And now for a little Fife.

35:13.301 --> 35:15.011
Sultan, wait!

35:16.512 --> 35:20.772
Don't worry yourself about me.
I'll just sit here. Snow is fine.

35:21.225 --> 35:23.435
A little wet, but who's complaining?

35:23.728 --> 35:28.318
Yes, my dear. Come to me.

35:28.691 --> 35:31.361
Come here, boy. Come here.

35:39.994 --> 35:43.374
Good doggy. Nice doggy.

35:44.540 --> 35:47.040
- Sultan?
- Back off, doggy.

35:49.879 --> 35:51.419
Hello?

35:53.382 --> 35:54.762
Hello?

35:54.842 --> 35:57.512
Well, maybe there's nobody here.

35:58.221 --> 36:01.018
Maybe we should go.

36:02.308 --> 36:04.518
What's the matter, Sultan?

36:07.939 --> 36:12.069
Oh, hello. I don't believe we've met.
I... I'm Belle.

36:12.401 --> 36:15.241
- And you are?
- Fife.

36:16.171 --> 36:20.791
Down, boy, down.
We heard the most beautiful music.

36:21.244 --> 36:23.583
- Was it you?
- Me?

36:23.663 --> 36:27.003
You thought that was me?

36:30.920 --> 36:32.830
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> please.

36:33.798 --> 36:36.928
I am Maestro Forte,

36:37.009 --> 36:41.389
court composer
and your most humble servant.

36:41.472 --> 36:44.682
Pleased to meet you, <i>Monsieur</i> Forte.
I'm Belle.

36:44.767 --> 36:49.147
Yes. The entire castle is talking
about you, child.

36:49.230 --> 36:54.030
They say you're planning
a Christmas gala. Marvelous idea.

36:54.110 --> 36:59.280
The very thing to shatter
the master's dark and gloomy past.

36:59.365 --> 37:03.575
But you must make this
the grandest celebration ever.

37:03.661 --> 37:05.081
- Have you gifts?
- Yep.

37:05.162 --> 37:06.162
- Food?
- Yep.

37:06.247 --> 37:08.367
- Garlands, ribbons, wreaths?
- Check.

37:08.457 --> 37:10.627
Spangles and "fandangles"?

37:10.710 --> 37:13.549
The trinkets, the trimmings,
the trappings?

37:13.629 --> 37:17.219
- Yep, we got 'em all.
- A tree?

37:19.343 --> 37:21.763
See, Belle? I told you.

37:21.846 --> 37:23.466
Well, we found one.

37:23.556 --> 37:26.726
But it was on the piddlin' side of puny.

37:28.519 --> 37:31.899
But did you look in the Black Forest?

37:32.440 --> 37:34.900
There you will find a tree

37:34.984 --> 37:38.282
better than any you can dream of.

37:38.362 --> 37:40.822
Better? We gotta go, Belle!

37:42.658 --> 37:45.368
- We gotta!
- Chip, we can't.

37:46.203 --> 37:50.083
I... I promised your master
I wouldn't leave the castle grounds.

37:50.166 --> 37:51.326
I gave my word.

37:51.417 --> 37:55.167
Chin up, son.
There's a profound lesson here.

37:55.880 --> 38:01.680
Keeping your word is much more
important than bringing joy to another.

38:01.761 --> 38:03.891
You're twisting what I said.

38:03.971 --> 38:06.931
Not at all. I agree with you.

38:07.016 --> 38:11.146
Look after yourself.
Let the master do the same.

38:11.228 --> 38:13.108
Never mind that the tree

38:13.189 --> 38:17.488
was always his favorite part of Christmas.

38:17.568 --> 38:21.358
Please, Belle? Please?

38:22.865 --> 38:24.775
It looks dangerous.

38:25.567 --> 38:28.957
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> you are in more danger

38:29.038 --> 38:32.458
in this very room, I assure you.

38:33.876 --> 38:34.916
All right.

38:35.002 --> 38:36.799
- Yes!
- We'll take Phillippe.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.968
If we hurry, we can be back by nightfall.

38:39.048 --> 38:42.548
- Hurray!
<i>- Au revoir, Monsieur</i> Forte.

38:43.052 --> 38:45.852
You'll keep my secret, won't you?

38:46.555 --> 38:48.805
Of course, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

38:48.891 --> 38:52.271
The master will remain
completely in the dark.

38:52.353 --> 38:54.153
<i>Au revoir,</i> Fife.

38:56.524 --> 38:59.494
Fife! I want you to follow her.

38:59.819 --> 39:03.659
Make sure they don't come back.

39:03.739 --> 39:07.119
Oh, yeah, but, Maestro, she's so nice.

39:07.201 --> 39:09.661
When you're finished fawning, Fife,

39:09.745 --> 39:14.625
perhaps you can recommend
someone else to play your solo.

39:14.709 --> 39:17.089
No! I'm going. I'm going.

39:27.722 --> 39:31.772
- Cogsworth!
- Oh, dear. Yes. Coming. Coming.

39:32.309 --> 39:34.649
Cogsworth!

39:34.729 --> 39:38.979
Running, running. Almost there.
You bellowed, sir?

39:39.066 --> 39:42.066
Find Belle. I... Uh...

39:42.153 --> 39:46.369
Well, I... She has to hear a song.

39:46.449 --> 39:49.119
Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Uh, yes.

39:49.618 --> 39:52.868
Splendid. Yes, well... Splendid.

39:52.955 --> 39:53.995
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

39:55.541 --> 39:58.001
Belle. Belle?

39:58.085 --> 40:00.245
Where is she? Belle?

40:01.338 --> 40:03.378
Careful, careful.

40:03.466 --> 40:06.546
Too fast! Get out of the way! Stop!

40:07.261 --> 40:08.261
Huh!

40:08.345 --> 40:09.635
Amateurs.

40:10.097 --> 40:14.187
Belle? Here... Excuse me. Hello?

40:14.268 --> 40:17.608
Has anyone seen Belle?
I can't find her anywhere.

40:17.688 --> 40:19.818
And the master is demanding
to see her now.

40:19.899 --> 40:22.399
He's got a song he wants her to hear.

40:23.694 --> 40:28.661
Last I saw of her, she was going
with Chip to look for a Christmas tree.

40:30.576 --> 40:33.326
Right. We must conduct
a search of the grounds.

40:33.412 --> 40:38.671
- Lumiere, you're with me.
- Cogsworth! I'm waiting!

40:38.751 --> 40:41.881
Oh, dear. Running, running, running.
I'm almost there, sir.

40:42.838 --> 40:45.468
Mrs. Potts, stall the master.
All right, Lumiere, we're...

40:45.549 --> 40:48.219
Lumiere? Wait, I'm leading.

40:48.302 --> 40:50.472
Me first, you second.

40:52.473 --> 40:56.353
Belle! Belle! Where is she?

40:56.435 --> 40:59.105
Belle? Belle?

40:59.188 --> 41:00.608
Belle, where are you?

41:00.689 --> 41:02.939
Lumiere, wait.

41:10.157 --> 41:12.367
The Black Forest!

41:13.119 --> 41:15.079
Come along. Hurry now!

41:16.080 --> 41:19.460
Oh, no. This is catastrophic!

41:20.376 --> 41:22.746
Cogsworth, quit dawdling.

41:22.837 --> 41:24.957
I'm not dawdling. I'm waddling.

41:25.047 --> 41:29.717
Well, don't waddle then.
We're in a hurry, you lazy old clock.

41:45.734 --> 41:48.404
Why am I still waiting?

41:48.904 --> 41:52.204
- Mrs. Potts!
- Coming, sir! Coming!

41:52.658 --> 41:54.618
What a brisk day!

41:54.702 --> 41:58.292
Why, you look positively chilled
to the bone.

41:58.873 --> 42:00.503
Where's Belle?

42:00.583 --> 42:04.503
How about a nice cup of tea, sir?
Just a spot.

42:04.879 --> 42:06.049
Hmm.

42:07.089 --> 42:09.589
Forte, play Belle's song!

42:12.511 --> 42:13.931
Hot.

42:15.472 --> 42:17.272
You're not singing!

42:19.310 --> 42:24.440
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

42:24.523 --> 42:28.280
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

42:28.360 --> 42:29.650
Louder!

42:30.487 --> 42:32.487
<i>'Tis the season</i>

42:32.573 --> 42:35.871
A bit more tea, sir?
Good for the heart, you know.

42:35.951 --> 42:37.039
No, thank you.

42:37.119 --> 42:39.119
- Just a spot?
- No more.

42:39.205 --> 42:42.285
- Well, there's always room for tea, love.
- I said, "No more."

42:42.374 --> 42:44.713
- Oh, dearie me!
- Mrs. Potts,

42:44.793 --> 42:47.800
are you trying to distract me?

42:47.880 --> 42:50.970
Goodness, no, sir.

42:51.050 --> 42:53.889
Heavens. Is that a yellow-bellied,
double-breasted sapsucker?

42:53.969 --> 42:57.139
- Rare this time of year.
- Enough! Where's Cogsworth?

42:57.223 --> 42:59.353
- Where's Belle?
- Belle?

42:59.433 --> 43:03.063
We can't find her, sir.

43:03.145 --> 43:04.555
What?

43:04.647 --> 43:06.017
Leave me!

43:08.692 --> 43:10.692
Show me the girl.

43:16.325 --> 43:18.695
- I will bring her back!
- No!

43:18.911 --> 43:21.161
Um, she's abandoned you.

43:21.447 --> 43:24.247
Listen to your old friend, won't you?

43:24.333 --> 43:27.543
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Led you astray?

43:27.628 --> 43:30.458
No. But the girl...

43:31.006 --> 43:35.176
<i>The quickest way to break your heart</i>

43:35.261 --> 43:38.931
<i>Make you depressed and ill</i>

43:39.014 --> 43:43.144
<i>Is to get tangled up inside</i>

43:43.227 --> 43:46.977
<i>The side effects could kill</i>

43:47.064 --> 43:51.154
<i>All passion is a waste of time</i>

43:51.235 --> 43:53.855
<i>A deadly game</i> pour vous

43:55.064 --> 43:59.330
<i>I am your friend, your</i> cher ami

43:59.410 --> 44:04.040
<i>I wouldn't lie to you</i>

44:05.165 --> 44:08.495
<i>If you must love someone may I suggest</i>

44:08.585 --> 44:11.875
<i>You love yourself, just think it through</i>

44:11.964 --> 44:15.384
<i>You'll never leave
and you will find you'll get more rest</i>

44:15.467 --> 44:18.797
<i>You'll always feel as good as new</i>

44:18.887 --> 44:22.017
<i>Your freedom is the most
important thing, my friend</i>

44:22.099 --> 44:25.389
<i>You must be strong, you mustn't bend</i>

44:25.477 --> 44:27.477
<i>Don't talk for hours, don't send flowers</i>

44:27.563 --> 44:29.568
<i>Don't write poems
Don't sing songs and dance</i>

44:29.648 --> 44:32.398
<i>Beneath the stars that shine above</i>

44:32.484 --> 44:35.404
<i>Don't fall in love</i>

44:35.988 --> 44:39.278
Oh, don't do it.

44:41.035 --> 44:45.245
<i>As soon as your heart rules your head</i>

44:45.331 --> 44:48.831
<i>Your life is not your own</i>

44:48.917 --> 44:52.797
<i>It's hell when someone's always there</i>

44:52.880 --> 44:56.800
<i>It's bliss to be alone</i>

44:56.884 --> 45:00.804
<i>And love of any kind is bad</i>

45:00.888 --> 45:04.388
<i>A dog, a child, a cat</i>

45:04.475 --> 45:08.975
<i>They take up so much precious time</i>

45:09.063 --> 45:13.533
<i>Now, where's the sense in that</i>

45:15.527 --> 45:18.947
<i>Love takes the wildest heart
and makes it tame</i>

45:19.031 --> 45:22.281
<i>If you're turned on then just turn off</i>

45:22.368 --> 45:25.868
<i>Emotions are a thing
all great men overcame</i>

45:25.954 --> 45:29.124
<i>Please, don't make this</i> grande catastrophe

45:29.208 --> 45:32.628
<i>Don't get attached to anyone or anything</i>

45:32.711 --> 45:36.010
<i>There's nothing worse
than things that cling</i>

45:36.090 --> 45:37.800
<i>You'll go to pot, you'll turn to drink</i>

45:37.883 --> 45:39.513
<i>You'll never rest, you'll end up mad</i>

45:39.593 --> 45:43.263
<i>And looking like some poor demented dove</i>

45:43.347 --> 45:48.887
<i>Don't fall in love</i>

45:48.977 --> 45:52.147
<i>Don't fall in love!</i>

45:56.527 --> 45:59.317
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45:59.405 --> 46:02.565
They cannot mix bells with holly.

46:02.658 --> 46:06.288
Still, I have to admit,
not bad for amateurs.

46:22.553 --> 46:25.353
I knew this was hopeless.

46:56.879 --> 46:59.209
There. That's it! That's it!

47:02.217 --> 47:04.757
Oh, Chip, it's perfect.

47:11.602 --> 47:15.982
- Do you see her?
- Not yet. Now, come along. Hurry!

47:19.485 --> 47:22.315
You go on. I'll never make it.

47:25.741 --> 47:27.281
Save yourself.

47:28.744 --> 47:31.458
Ah, it will be summer
before we reach them.

47:31.538 --> 47:33.288
What the... Whoa!

47:34.541 --> 47:35.631
Oh, dear!

47:40.204 --> 47:43.971
Faster! Faster!
I think we finally found a use for you.

47:44.051 --> 47:46.681
Clock boarding! No, snow clocking!

47:47.513 --> 47:48.973
Whatever!

47:59.942 --> 48:04.032
- It's the best tree ever!
- Chip, you're right.

48:04.112 --> 48:08.282
Merry Christmas! And a happy Hanukkah!

48:08.951 --> 48:12.081
We better hurry. It's getting very stormy.

48:15.123 --> 48:17.213
Again with the chopping.

48:17.960 --> 48:21.890
Oh, I gotta do something.
Forte's counting on me.

48:27.636 --> 48:30.096
Timber!

48:38.146 --> 48:40.146
Take it away, Phillippe!

48:52.244 --> 48:53.584
Oh, no!

49:06.842 --> 49:08.092
Fife?

49:08.876 --> 49:12.354
Uh, hi, Belle. Nice tree.

49:12.889 --> 49:14.769
What are you doing way out here?

49:14.850 --> 49:17.770
Uh, nothin'. I just was walkin'.

49:17.853 --> 49:21.163
I mean, I love the bitter cold. I mean...

49:27.195 --> 49:28.735
Phillippe!

49:33.243 --> 49:34.703
Oh, no!

49:38.541 --> 49:41.630
The tree, Belle!
We're gonna lose the tree!

49:41.710 --> 49:43.250
Whoa!

49:44.087 --> 49:46.087
Chip! Oh!

49:47.174 --> 49:48.634
Where is he?

49:48.717 --> 49:51.047
Whoa! Whoa!

50:16.828 --> 50:20.668
- Hold on, <i>chérie</i>. I will save you!
- Oh, dear!

50:21.249 --> 50:24.749
Oh, no. Oh, gosh. Oh, no.
Oh, gosh. Oh, no. Oh, gosh.

50:25.170 --> 50:26.510
Oh, no!

50:37.599 --> 50:42.059
- Oh, Chip, thank goodness you're safe.
- I wasn't scared.

50:46.191 --> 50:47.821
Oh, no! No!

51:13.260 --> 51:14.640
Belle!

51:26.148 --> 51:29.068
Oh, no, what have I done?

51:29.985 --> 51:31.735
It's all my fault.

51:31.820 --> 51:37.240
We all share some blame, <i>mon ami,</i>
for daring to hope for a Christmas.

51:59.347 --> 52:01.807
You said you'd never leave.

52:06.104 --> 52:08.444
I wasn't trying to leave.

52:10.275 --> 52:12.985
I just wanted to make you happy.

52:15.447 --> 52:18.577
You broke your word.

52:18.658 --> 52:24.118
And for that, you will rot
in this dungeon forever.

52:25.999 --> 52:30.549
I should have known
you'd never be anything but a beast.

52:36.218 --> 52:38.048
Midnight.

52:38.136 --> 52:40.596
Merry Christmas, Cogsworth.

52:41.014 --> 52:42.974
If only it were.

52:45.560 --> 52:51.150
Oh, my dear old friend,
I told you not to feel for her.

52:51.775 --> 52:56.395
Things were so much simpler
before she came along,

52:56.488 --> 53:00.488
before we dared to hope.

53:01.159 --> 53:05.369
Oh, I thought she was the one.

53:07.541 --> 53:08.841
Belle?

53:09.709 --> 53:11.629
There she is.

53:11.711 --> 53:16.131
- Merry Christmas.
- Doesn't look so special to me.

53:16.758 --> 53:21.008
Oh, Chip, I'm sorry.

53:21.680 --> 53:23.390
Nothing's changed.

53:23.473 --> 53:26.143
I told you nothing would change.

53:26.226 --> 53:28.186
I told you the master
would not allow this.

53:28.270 --> 53:31.770
I told you Christmas was a hopeless folly!

53:32.774 --> 53:34.114
But

53:35.443 --> 53:36.993
I was wrong.

53:40.323 --> 53:44.331
<i>When I felt lost</i>

53:44.411 --> 53:47.459
<i>And lonely</i>

53:47.539 --> 53:52.879
<i>Not a dream in my head</i>

53:54.170 --> 53:59.050
<i>Your words lifted my spirits</i>

53:59.134 --> 54:01.264
<i>High</i>

54:01.344 --> 54:04.224
<i>Remember what</i>

54:04.306 --> 54:06.726
<i>You said</i>

54:08.393 --> 54:14.611
<i>As long as there's Christmas</i>

54:14.691 --> 54:19.651
<i>I truly believe</i>

54:20.655 --> 54:26.365
<i>That hope is the greatest</i>

54:26.453 --> 54:32.543
<i>Of the gifts we'll receive</i>

54:33.376 --> 54:36.246
<i>- As long as
- As long as</i>

54:36.338 --> 54:40.588
<i>Our guiding star</i>

54:40.675 --> 54:45.305
<i>Shines above</i>

54:45.388 --> 54:49.018
<i>There'll always be</i>

54:49.100 --> 54:55.400
<i>Christmas</i>

54:55.482 --> 54:58.780
<i>So there always</i>

54:58.860 --> 55:02.070
<i>Will be a time</i>

55:02.155 --> 55:07.945
<i>When the world is filled with peace</i>

55:08.662 --> 55:15.342
<i>And love</i>

55:21.132 --> 55:26.302
Ah, it tears me up
to see you this way, master.

55:26.388 --> 55:28.558
Why do you torment yourself?

55:28.640 --> 55:31.640
There's the symbol of your curse.

55:31.726 --> 55:35.436
Destroy it, and end
these adolescent notions

55:35.522 --> 55:38.862
of love and redemption.

55:38.942 --> 55:42.742
End your pain forever.

55:45.073 --> 55:48.453
Yes! Do it!

55:48.618 --> 55:51.038
Smash it!

55:58.920 --> 56:00.510
Belle?

56:03.633 --> 56:06.013
What are you doing? What is it?

56:11.057 --> 56:14.307
Oh, a storybook.

56:14.394 --> 56:17.801
Does this one have pretty pictures
you can color?

56:18.481 --> 56:21.029
Utterly dreadful, master.

56:21.109 --> 56:25.989
No! This one's different. It's from Belle.

56:26.072 --> 56:29.579
Well, that would account
for the creative wrapping.

56:29.659 --> 56:31.169
Quiet!

56:33.538 --> 56:35.078
I want to read.

56:40.503 --> 56:44.593
<i>"Once upon a time,
there was an enchanted castle.</i>

56:44.674 --> 56:49.140
<i>"Its master seemed as cold as winter.
Deep inside his heart...</i>

56:49.220 --> 56:52.350
<i>"His cries of anger echoed through
the stone wall of the castle.</i>

56:52.432 --> 56:56.898
<i>"Though surrounded by servants,
he was all alone.</i>

56:56.978 --> 56:59.938
<i>"And in that simple act of kindness,</i>

57:00.023 --> 57:02.570
<i>"he knew someone cared.</i>

57:02.650 --> 57:06.530
<i>"Christmas that year was spent
exchanging humble gifts.</i>

57:06.613 --> 57:09.911
<i>"But the greatest gift
that anyone received</i>

57:09.991 --> 57:12.831
<i>"was the gift of hope."</i>

57:17.665 --> 57:18.995
Hope.

57:26.758 --> 57:28.928
No, master! Come back!

57:29.010 --> 57:31.930
She'll only prolong your torment!

57:32.388 --> 57:37.348
You know what, Belle? I don't need
a tree to celebrate Christmas.

57:37.435 --> 57:40.225
And I can do without mistletoe.

57:41.314 --> 57:44.194
- Well, I don't need tinsel.
- Oh, I don't need holly.

57:44.275 --> 57:46.605
- And I don't need a wreath.
- I don't need ornaments!

57:46.694 --> 57:49.614
- And I don't need turkey!
- I don't need stuffing!

57:49.697 --> 57:52.827
I don't need pudding!

57:52.909 --> 57:56.149
<i>To each his own, my friend
You know how to get me stressed</i>

57:56.221 --> 57:58.791
<i>But when it comes to
making Christmas special...</i>

57:58.873 --> 58:00.462
<i>I'm a cut above the rest</i>

58:00.542 --> 58:03.798
<i>If you could see things clearly
you would say that I've been blessed</i>

58:03.878 --> 58:06.628
<i>You can't hold a candle to my timing</i>

58:06.714 --> 58:09.179
<i>I'm a cut above the rest</i>

58:09.259 --> 58:12.889
<i>You belong side by side
You should never be apart</i>

58:12.971 --> 58:17.228
<i>'Cause when you're both together
you're really twice as smart</i>

58:17.308 --> 58:20.308
"Twice as smart." She does have a point.

58:20.395 --> 58:23.645
Yes, well, two heads are better than one.

58:23.731 --> 58:26.941
<i>They say that as a team
we have got to be the best</i>

58:27.026 --> 58:29.526
<i>Now we found something we both agree on</i>

58:29.612 --> 58:31.159
<i>We're a cut above the rest</i>

58:31.239 --> 58:34.739
<i>There's no doubt that as a team
we two are the very best</i>

58:34.826 --> 58:37.196
<i>Everyone who knows us must agree</i>

58:37.287 --> 58:38.907
<i>We're a cut above the rest</i>

58:38.997 --> 58:42.327
<i>There's no doubt that as a team
you two are the very best</i>

58:42.417 --> 58:44.997
<i>Everyone who knows you must agree</i>

58:45.086 --> 58:47.376
<i>- We're a cut
- A cut above</i>

58:47.463 --> 58:49.133
<i>Above the rest</i>

58:51.759 --> 58:53.889
Uh-oh! It's the master!

58:54.762 --> 58:57.392
Uh, Belle...

59:07.984 --> 59:10.154
Can you forgive me?

59:17.202 --> 59:20.542
Of course. Merry Christmas.

59:21.039 --> 59:22.289
All right!

59:22.665 --> 59:26.085
Let's give Belle the Christmas
she's always wanted.

59:26.961 --> 59:29.341
So, Beast gets girl,

59:29.422 --> 59:32.552
and it's a happy ending for everyone.

59:33.176 --> 59:35.636
Enchantment lifted,

59:36.304 --> 59:39.724
and Forte fades into the background.

59:40.225 --> 59:45.145
No longer important. No longer needed.

59:45.813 --> 59:47.903
I think not!

59:58.284 --> 01:00:01.082
What is it, Mama? What's happening?

01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:08.126
Watch out!

01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:11.416
Forte!

01:00:14.676 --> 01:00:16.756
- Whoa!
- Hurry, now. Hurry.

01:00:18.513 --> 01:00:21.683
Can you believe I never took a lesson?

01:00:25.186 --> 01:00:26.516
Belle!

01:00:27.397 --> 01:00:28.607
- Oh, no!
- Belle!

01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:29.860
Help!

01:00:41.077 --> 01:00:42.117
Oh, no.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.040
Maestro! Stop!

01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:52.963
- What do you think you're doing?
- Don't you see, Fife?

01:00:53.047 --> 01:00:56.337
They can't fall in love if they're dead.

01:00:56.426 --> 01:01:00.506
I'll tell you what I see.
A big, old windbag!

01:01:01.806 --> 01:01:04.426
You could've joined me, Fife,

01:01:04.517 --> 01:01:08.397
but I see my triumph is a solo act.

01:01:10.231 --> 01:01:12.691
My solo... It's blank!

01:01:13.943 --> 01:01:15.653
So naive.

01:01:15.737 --> 01:01:18.317
- No! No, no!
- You're second fiddle, Fife,

01:01:18.406 --> 01:01:21.326
and that's all you'll ever be.

01:01:21.409 --> 01:01:23.409
Forte!

01:01:27.081 --> 01:01:30.251
We can remain as we are forever and ever!

01:01:37.759 --> 01:01:39.759
Forte!

01:01:45.767 --> 01:01:47.637
Enough!

01:01:47.727 --> 01:01:49.767
Heavens! Master.

01:01:51.272 --> 01:01:53.572
You're not singing.

01:02:04.035 --> 01:02:05.405
Careful.

01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:15.341
Oh, no, the bell jar!

01:02:15.421 --> 01:02:19.051
- Whoa! Got it. Got it.
- Oh, careful.

01:02:19.133 --> 01:02:22.140
Is this happy enough for you, master?

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:26.640
I know I'm downright giddy!

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.850
Master, the keyboard.

01:02:56.462 --> 01:02:58.592
- You got it?
- Got it. Got it.

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:00.300
Whoa!

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.020
Help!

01:03:13.354 --> 01:03:17.154
No!

01:03:25.992 --> 01:03:27.372
Forte.

01:03:34.459 --> 01:03:37.419
Oh, yes, it is lovely.

01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:39.923
And you said it was impossible.

01:03:40.047 --> 01:03:41.587
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

01:03:41.883 --> 01:03:46.103
I said it was impossible without me.

01:03:46.512 --> 01:03:49.642
- Everyone, shh-shh! Here they come.
- Wow!

01:03:52.143 --> 01:03:54.193
The setting is perfect.

01:03:54.729 --> 01:03:57.059
Oh, aren't they beautiful?

01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:04.279
It's wonderful!

01:04:04.363 --> 01:04:06.119
Hurray!

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.660
And what a wonderful Christmas it was.

01:04:11.746 --> 01:04:17.166
I suppose if anyone saved Christmas,
it was Belle.

01:04:17.251 --> 01:04:19.590
Merry Christmas, one and all!

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.670
- Merry Christmas.
- And merry Christmas to you, sir.

01:04:22.757 --> 01:04:25.427
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:29.220
I believe we have
a little something for you, Chip.

01:04:29.305 --> 01:04:32.345
A present? Oh, boy! Thank you.

01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:34.021
Open it!

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.360
Look, Mama! A storybook!
Would you read it to me?

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.070
- I'd love to, son.
- Oh, boy!

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:48.027
Maestro?

01:04:50.201 --> 01:04:53.661
- Yes, master?
- Would you do us the honor, old friend?

01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:56.380
I'd be delighted.
