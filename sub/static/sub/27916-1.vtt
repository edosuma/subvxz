00:20.890 --> 00:23.043
See that pretty face of yours.

00:24.216 --> 00:25.359
Mmmm.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.260
I used to have a pretty face too.

00:28.261 --> 00:30.090
Then I met this girl named Mary.

00:33.177 --> 00:34.010
You know how that goes.

00:34.011 --> 00:35.120
Please.

00:35.121 --> 00:35.954
Yeah.

00:35.954 --> 00:36.787
No.

00:36.787 --> 00:37.620
Women!

04:21.069 --> 04:21.902
Hello?

04:34.771 --> 04:35.604
Who is it?

05:32.927 --> 05:34.073
Hello?

05:47.967 --> 05:48.967
Boo!

05:56.111 --> 05:58.185
Oh.
Holy shit.

05:58.186 --> 06:00.226
You fucking scared the shit out of me.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.877
You should have seen your face.

06:03.390 --> 06:05.113
Oh man up, we've got one to drink.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.833
Thanks.

06:07.670 --> 06:10.020
Bravo, you're fucking
giving me a heart attack.

06:11.570 --> 06:13.129
When did you get back?

06:13.130 --> 06:14.199
Like an hour ago.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.641
Thought I'd stop by and see
my favorite gimpy friend.

06:17.642 --> 06:18.475
Is that okay?

06:20.250 --> 06:22.853

06:52.400 --> 06:54.159

06:54.160 --> 06:56.823
Okay, I'm taking them
off, I'm taking them off.

07:00.370 --> 07:02.213
So how was the flight?

07:03.800 --> 07:04.899
Awful.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.609
Oh and I was sitting
next to this little brat

07:06.610 --> 07:08.969
who coughed and shit on me the whole time.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.809
I swear I'm gonna get sick.

Oh, what is this?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.480
What's what?

07:15.481 --> 07:17.859
You have something right here.

07:17.860 --> 07:20.139
It looks like herbies.

07:20.140 --> 07:20.973
Herbies?

07:22.540 --> 07:23.926
No it doesn't.

07:23.927 --> 07:24.760
Cold sore.

07:24.761 --> 07:26.153
It does not look like, you're a brat.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.149
It does not look like herpes.

07:38.150 --> 07:39.173
You're a jerk.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.979
Where'd you get this?

07:42.980 --> 07:45.969
Well one of my classmate
took me to the Rose Bowl

07:45.970 --> 07:48.947
and an old lady literally begged me

07:48.948 --> 07:50.093
to take it with me home.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.270
And it's kind of cool.

07:55.966 --> 07:56.973
Mhmm, sure is.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.170
What?

08:01.050 --> 08:02.409
Smells like old people.

08:02.410 --> 08:04.369
I hate that.

08:04.370 --> 08:05.639
It freaks me out.

08:05.640 --> 08:09.399
Okay, and what's worse,
old people or brats?

08:09.400 --> 08:10.233
Both.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.153
Touche.

08:14.610 --> 08:17.053
So how'd you get around the Rose Bowl?

08:18.270 --> 08:21.879
Well, she made me use a wheelchair.

08:21.880 --> 08:22.713
No.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.849
Oh yeah.

08:24.850 --> 08:26.493
It was actually kind of awesome.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.269
It was, move bitches, skip the line,

08:31.270 --> 08:33.873
just me rolling around.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.679
Well.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.369
Lines suck, so,

08:39.370 --> 08:40.403
I guess that's okay.

08:41.567 --> 08:43.323
Hey, you should be
resting your leg anyway.

08:45.342 --> 08:46.175
I'll do that.

08:46.175 --> 08:47.008
Thank you.

09:00.610 --> 09:01.889
So?

09:01.890 --> 09:03.373
How was your trip?

09:05.580 --> 09:06.829
I know you.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.499
I know how you get.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.809
So we don't have to talk about it.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.839
Spill the beans.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.299
Come on, just because I'm miserable

09:15.300 --> 09:16.950
doesn't mean that you have to be.

09:17.853 --> 09:19.113
Hah, no kidding.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.433
Okay, we'll wait till later.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.289
You need a top off?

09:41.290 --> 09:42.123
Hold on.

09:50.130 --> 09:52.893
And the award for the
best actress goes to,

09:53.970 --> 09:55.773
Shut up, it really hurts.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.819
Mom, dad, Steven.

10:02.820 --> 10:06.749
I just really wanna say thank you so much

10:06.750 --> 10:08.649

10:08.650 --> 10:09.553

10:10.880 --> 10:15.529
I just, yes, feel,

an awards show before?

10:18.665 --> 10:19.935

Okay, that is exceptionally creepy.

11:15.733 --> 11:17.316
I know.

11:18.943 --> 11:20.809
God, I mean don't get me wrong, Picasso.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.843
It is creepy but that is
amazing at the same time.

11:24.898 --> 11:26.306
God, look at that eyeball.

11:26.307 --> 11:27.140
The class is gonna go nuts for this.

11:27.140 --> 11:27.973
Look at that detail.

11:27.974 --> 11:30.833
It's just so unrealized.

11:32.106 --> 11:35.212
Unrealized, who says that?

11:35.213 --> 11:40.213
I just did.
It's stupid.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.563
I can't do anything right lately.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.409
So you're just gonna
go destroy your artwork,

12:08.410 --> 12:09.443
throw a hissy fit?

12:10.343 --> 12:12.309
It's garbage.

12:12.310 --> 12:15.719
Most great artists,
like really great artists

12:15.720 --> 12:17.113
are tortured souls.

12:20.935 --> 12:22.559
I am not a tortured soul.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.913
That was really dumb,
especially for you.

12:26.670 --> 12:29.599
I just feel that
everything I paint lately

12:29.600 --> 12:31.489
is very depressing.

12:31.490 --> 12:35.169
Because life is sunshine
and rainbows all the time.

12:35.170 --> 12:38.399

Lisa Frank in the fifth grade.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.023
Shut up.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.253
You shut up!

12:51.494 --> 12:52.327
Ow, fuck!

12:54.772 --> 12:56.355
You're a bitch, oh.

Ow.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.488
I'm not always mean.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.933
So when can you run again?

13:15.615 --> 13:16.515
Not soon enough.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.719
And, I could really use
some cheap ass therapy.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.679
That's why I don't run.

13:24.680 --> 13:25.719
Too dangerous.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.548
No, you're just lazy.

13:28.549 --> 13:30.359
I am not lazy.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.429

13:38.322 --> 13:40.523
Yeah, me too, ooh.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.939
Gonna start a team, then you do tris.

13:47.940 --> 13:48.773
Oh yeah.

13:50.792 --> 13:53.062
I learned this from Jillian Michaels.

13:54.110 --> 13:54.963
We're losers.

13:59.570 --> 14:00.809
Just be happy it wasn't worse.

14:00.810 --> 14:02.260
It could have been way worse.

14:03.690 --> 14:05.099
Yeah.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.423
How awesome.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.860
This has been the worst month of all time.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.009
I can't believe I blow my knee out

14:14.010 --> 14:16.169

14:16.170 --> 14:17.023
I'm sorry.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.253
And on top of that,

14:22.520 --> 14:23.879
I get dumped too.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.680
He was a fucking asshole, Mallory.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.489
I feel like the ultimate loser.

14:33.490 --> 14:34.843
Seriously, stop that.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.469
He was such a loser.

14:40.470 --> 14:41.659
You deserve so much better.

14:41.660 --> 14:42.739
You're gonna go out and you're gonna find

14:42.740 --> 14:44.879
somebody who treats you like gold.

14:44.880 --> 14:49.009
'Cause he, Chuck, is

I love dogs.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.089
The fact that you're dwelling over him

14:56.090 --> 14:58.269
is seriously unacceptable.

14:58.270 --> 15:00.479
You dodged a major bullet with that one.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.320
Okay.

15:01.321 --> 15:05.039
Seriously now, you get free rein

15:05.040 --> 15:06.289
like the easy way out.

15:06.290 --> 15:08.799
You could go about doing
your artwork still.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.819
Be single, be fabulous

15:11.820 --> 15:13.739
without having to worry about him

15:13.740 --> 15:17.079
and his shenanigans.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.080
I didn't want out.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.549
Mal, he was such a dick.

15:22.550 --> 15:24.919
You're not helping right now.

Okay?

Please.

15:32.860 --> 15:33.899
Fine.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.739
I'm not the one that brought it up.

15:35.740 --> 15:37.740
Yeah and you're not helping right now.

15:45.220 --> 15:46.820
This has nothing to do with you.

15:48.620 --> 15:53.620

about everything.

15:59.940 --> 16:01.023
I know.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.570
Did you tell your mom yet?

16:06.481 --> 16:07.314
Nah.

16:08.350 --> 16:09.819
Nah.

16:09.820 --> 16:12.999
She has way too many troubles on her own.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.550
Don't tell me, what happened?

16:15.390 --> 16:18.243
Let's just say that men are pigs.

gonna send you some money?

17:05.390 --> 17:06.729
Nope.

17:06.730 --> 17:09.839
And I can't get another job
because of my student visa.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.959
And eventually I'm gonna run out of money

17:12.960 --> 17:15.963

17:17.060 --> 17:18.460

behind the counter.

the weirdest look.

he like crosses himself like this

18:49.410 --> 18:51.889
and he walked away real slowly.

18:51.890 --> 18:54.529
Just eyes glued to me the whole time.

18:54.530 --> 18:56.769
And then, he walked behind a curtain,

18:56.770 --> 18:59.689
this big black curtain
and just disappeared.

18:59.690 --> 19:04.060
So I bolted out of there,
just like "Nope, out."

19:05.950 --> 19:07.339
So then I went to straw market,

19:07.340 --> 19:09.679
and there's a place where
you get like, souvenirs

19:09.680 --> 19:13.559
and knockoff handbags,
and like shoes and stuff.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.910
Like Chinatown.

19:16.409 --> 19:17.549
Like Chinatown.

19:17.550 --> 19:21.149
I went to this like frogwire
thing right next to Chinatown.

19:21.150 --> 19:23.239
There's the cutest bartender in this place

19:23.240 --> 19:24.469
called like Frog Bar or something.

19:24.470 --> 19:27.450
He was just pouring me like
Jaeger bombs like it was,

19:27.451 --> 19:28.284
Gwen, focus.

19:28.285 --> 19:29.369
I'm sorry.

19:29.370 --> 19:30.203
Okay.

19:30.204 --> 19:31.238
Okay.

19:31.239 --> 19:34.549
So I was walking through the
straw market Chinatown place

19:34.550 --> 19:36.216
and there were a bunch of
women yelling at me like

19:36.217 --> 19:37.436
"Pretty hair, get your hair,

19:37.437 --> 19:39.446
"pretty lady get your hair braided.

19:39.447 --> 19:40.649
"Come get your hair braided."

19:40.650 --> 19:42.429
Ooh, and they got you.

19:42.430 --> 19:43.666
They're really cute.

19:43.667 --> 19:44.668
They're really cute.

19:44.669 --> 19:45.758
They're like so cute, right?

19:45.759 --> 19:46.900
They're really cute.

19:46.901 --> 19:48.356
They're so cute.

19:48.357 --> 19:50.147
They're like so cute.

19:50.148 --> 19:50.981
So cute.

19:50.981 --> 19:51.860
You know, you like
them because they're like

19:51.861 --> 19:53.404
so cute, right?

19:53.405 --> 19:54.719
They're really cute, I like it.

19:56.243 --> 19:58.326
Oh my god, we need to call Patrick.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.699
Oh, oh my god I miss him.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.610
I miss him too.

20:01.611 --> 20:03.489
Is he still together with Daniel?

20:03.490 --> 20:04.768
No, they broke up.

20:04.769 --> 20:06.124
What?

20:06.125 --> 20:06.958
Mhmm.

20:06.959 --> 20:08.689
It was mutual, though.

20:08.690 --> 20:10.673
They were so good together.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.089
Focus, back to my
story, back to my story.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.609
Okay, please, yes.

20:16.610 --> 20:18.069
So then I like sit down with this lady

20:18.070 --> 20:18.903
and she's braiding my hair

20:18.904 --> 20:22.149
and I decided to tell her
my story about the shop.

20:22.150 --> 20:23.589
So soon as I tell her, she starts getting

20:23.590 --> 20:25.642
super serious on me, and,

20:25.643 --> 20:28.549
like grabs her bag, starts
fumbling around in it

20:28.550 --> 20:32.463
and mumbling something and
pulls out that necklace

20:32.464 --> 20:34.119
and puts it in my hand.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.540
No way.

20:35.541 --> 20:36.374
Mhmm.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.859
Get this, she leans in really close.

20:38.860 --> 20:40.909
Our noses are like almost touching, right?

20:40.910 --> 20:43.039
She looks me dead in the eyes and says

20:43.040 --> 20:46.769
you must wear this necklace
for protection, pretty girl.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.983
This necklace, it will protect you.

20:51.830 --> 20:53.130
And that's pretty much it.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.588
That is so fucking crazy.

20:55.589 --> 20:56.809
I know.

20:56.810 --> 21:00.389
Besides, you need the protection
more than me right now.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.709
And you like that hippy stuff.

21:02.710 --> 21:03.610
You're the best!

21:12.570 --> 21:13.403
It's perfect.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.323
What an amazing story too.

21:22.120 --> 21:22.953
Thank you.

21:24.810 --> 21:26.903
I don't know what I would do
without a friend like you.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.649
I kind of feel like I
was there a little too.

21:30.650 --> 21:31.483
Good.

21:33.061 --> 21:34.579
And you're not so bad yourself.

21:34.580 --> 21:35.750
You're ridiculous.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.380
Can't get it yourself, princess?

21:51.350 --> 21:52.183
What was that?

21:56.720 --> 21:59.229
You must have some really kinky neighbors.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.469
I don't have any neighbors.

22:00.470 --> 22:02.203
They moved out like two weeks ago.

22:05.150 --> 22:07.309
Okay, well, I'm sure it's just

22:07.310 --> 22:09.160
some animal on the roof or something.

22:10.910 --> 22:12.079
Don't freak out.

22:12.080 --> 22:12.943
Yeah.

22:17.460 --> 22:20.543
Anyhoo, I'ma go take care of these.

22:22.003 --> 22:23.420
For your majesty.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.803
It smells like rotten ass in there.

23:52.780 --> 23:54.658
It's probably your smelly ass.

23:54.659 --> 23:56.503
Please, it's not.

23:58.040 --> 23:58.873
You open it.

24:01.380 --> 24:03.633
Come on, wine's for the gods.

24:09.810 --> 24:12.369
Seriously, what the fuck was that?

24:12.370 --> 24:14.463
I am officially spooked now.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.119
I'm sure it's just
the wind or something.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.723
It's not that windy outside.

24:28.110 --> 24:30.603
Yeah well, I'll check anyway.

24:34.620 --> 24:36.769
You're fucking freaking me out.

24:36.770 --> 24:38.353
I'm gonna go check the bedroom.

24:41.720 --> 24:42.570
Okay.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.313
Be careful.

25:14.518 --> 25:15.351
Gwen?

25:19.453 --> 25:20.286
Gwen?

25:25.156 --> 25:26.153
Gwen?

25:26.153 --> 25:26.986
AAA, I'm gonna get you!

25:28.263 --> 25:30.594
Aaaa!

25:30.595 --> 25:35.312
Ow, ow!

25:39.300 --> 25:40.603
I hate you.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.942
You should have seen your face.

25:46.385 --> 25:48.109
Show me your balls, you big baby.

25:48.110 --> 25:48.980
Jesus!

25:48.981 --> 25:50.329
It wasn't funny the first time.

25:50.330 --> 25:51.486
Uh huh.

25:51.487 --> 25:53.769
I just gotta keep you on your toes, girl.

25:53.770 --> 25:56.256
I'm gonna get you really hard.

25:56.257 --> 25:57.257
High five.

25:59.334 --> 26:00.167
Loser.

26:03.038 --> 26:03.871
Gwen.

26:06.490 --> 26:08.253
You brat, that hurt.

26:09.630 --> 26:10.930
What's your wifi password?

26:12.490 --> 26:13.940
It's not working right now.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.754
What do you mean it's not working?

26:18.755 --> 26:21.105
I mean I can't get the
thingamajingy to work.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.410
Thingamajing, how long has it been?

26:28.140 --> 26:28.973
Two weeks?

26:30.700 --> 26:31.763
Two weeks?

26:32.680 --> 26:34.453
How do you live?

26:35.540 --> 26:36.373
I would die.

26:37.290 --> 26:38.369
I would literally die.

26:38.370 --> 26:40.329
Chuck used to take care
of these kind of things

26:40.330 --> 26:41.809
and I don't know how it works,

26:41.810 --> 26:44.119
these kind of high tech things.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.749
You sound like my grandma.

26:45.750 --> 26:46.949
I talked to her on the phone yesterday,

26:46.950 --> 26:49.907
she said I can't work
these high techie stuff.

26:49.908 --> 26:52.363
You will forever be a dinosaur.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.357
You're a grandma, aw.

26:58.125 --> 26:58.958
Dinosaur.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.577
You've gotta pee?

27:15.810 --> 27:18.996
I was just wondering
where that sound came from.

27:18.997 --> 27:20.747
Are you still really freaked out?

27:22.360 --> 27:23.343
I could spend the night if you want.

27:23.344 --> 27:25.643
I could sleep on the couch,
it's like a marshmallow.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.473
I'm fine, I just,

27:30.600 --> 27:32.679
I'm not used to being alone.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.376
And I'll get over it.

27:34.377 --> 27:35.899
Are you sure?

27:35.900 --> 27:36.733
I'm good.

27:40.513 --> 27:41.613
Whatever, your loss.

27:47.150 --> 27:51.283
And on that note, I better be going.

28:00.310 --> 28:01.143
Help me.

28:03.844 --> 28:05.224
Help me.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.259
Help me, Gwen.

28:06.260 --> 28:07.133
Save me.

28:13.031 --> 28:13.960
Use your muscles.

28:13.960 --> 28:14.793
Nope, over.

28:14.794 --> 28:15.941
Okay, okay.
There we go.

28:15.942 --> 28:17.599
Use your muscles, strong lady.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.343
Ugh, use your good leg, Shamu, Jesus.

28:21.620 --> 28:24.420
You're like a million pounds
for such a skinny creature.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.300
Do you need anything else before I leave?

28:36.180 --> 28:38.149
A man?

28:38.150 --> 28:39.800
Preaching to the choir, sister.

29:06.222 --> 29:08.555
What are you doing tomorrow?

29:09.920 --> 29:11.223
I have class at six.

29:13.390 --> 29:15.579
Well if you don't get out too late,

29:15.580 --> 29:17.169
do you wanna hang out?

29:17.170 --> 29:18.003
Yeah.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.113
Okay.

29:24.270 --> 29:25.322
I like your shoes.

29:25.323 --> 29:27.192
Oh, thank you.

29:27.193 --> 29:28.180
What size are they?

29:28.181 --> 29:29.769
Size not yours.

29:29.770 --> 29:30.603
Hahaha.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.353
Small feet.

29:43.820 --> 29:45.120
Thank you for coming over.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.353
Of course.

29:51.487 --> 29:52.563
No, thank you.

29:55.720 --> 29:56.553
Well.

29:58.063 --> 29:58.896
I love you too.

29:59.890 --> 30:00.723
Call me manana?

30:00.723 --> 30:01.556
Manana?

30:03.430 --> 30:05.309

30:05.310 --> 30:06.849
Okay.
Okay.

30:06.850 --> 30:08.313
Call me when you get home.

30:09.221 --> 30:10.054
Call you when I get home.

30:10.055 --> 30:12.569
Call me if you need anything.

30:12.570 --> 30:13.939

30:13.940 --> 30:15.290

01:06:56.464 --> 01:06:57.729
Who are you?

01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:00.267
Why are you doing this to me?

01:07:02.063 --> 01:07:04.677

01:21:34.064 --> 01:21:36.231
What about the necklace?

01:21:41.144 --> 01:21:41.977
It's cursed.

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.263

I made up that stupid bullshit story

01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:14.303
just to make you feel better.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.779
Fucking blame everything on other people.

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:18.930
Get your shit together!

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:24.763
Do you hear me?

01:22:27.266 --> 01:22:28.099
And I'm sorry I lied to you

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.529
but I picked up that necklace at LAX

01:22:29.530 --> 01:22:31.430
'cause I forgot to get you a souvenir.

01:22:35.808 --> 01:22:36.641
No.

01:22:36.641 --> 01:22:37.474
Get out of my face,

01:22:37.475 --> 01:22:38.909
I swear to fucking god, Mal.

01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:41.863
It's from the airport, it's not cursed.

01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:45.219
Quit blaming shit on me.

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:46.053
Fuck you.

01:22:47.187 --> 01:22:49.347
You know what, he said
that right before he,

01:22:58.355 --> 01:23:00.105
Get out of my face.

01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:11.068
You got it from the airport?

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.763
I'm trying to cheer you up, calm down.

01:23:20.735 --> 01:23:22.735
I'll get you some water.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:48.010
This is why you didn't call me?

01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:52.423
Fucking works now, so.

01:24:05.010 --> 01:24:08.123
Open it, put it up to your lips, drink.

01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:11.767
That's what you're supposed to do.

01:24:19.787 --> 01:24:22.037
How much easier do I
have to make it for you?

01:24:24.722 --> 01:24:26.679
You know what Mal, nobody comes in my room

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.759
and gets me out of bed in the morning.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.469
When I'm having a bad day,
nobody gets in my face

01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:33.409
and tells me to get over it

01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:35.569
or that it's gonna be okay.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:39.233
I have to get up and I
have to do that by myself.

01:24:49.402 --> 01:24:53.043
When's someone gonna go take care of me?

01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:59.593
I'm always there for you.

01:25:01.237 --> 01:25:02.487
I'm always there for you.

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:07.428
Is it 'cause I'm the strong one,

01:25:07.429 --> 01:25:10.809
I can handle my shit so nobody
gets to be there for me?

01:25:10.810 --> 01:25:14.279
They're always gotta be there
for other people like you.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.539
My family's not here.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:18.859
My family's not here so I have you.

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.613
And I take care of you.

01:25:21.978 --> 01:25:23.859
You get all of my energy.

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.879
When I'm sick, who brings me chicken soup?

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.380
Nobody brings me chicken soup!

01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:32.900
For once I would just like you

01:25:35.711 --> 01:25:38.544
to not blame me for your problems.

01:25:41.614 --> 01:25:43.463
You should ask me how I'm doing!

01:25:45.061 --> 01:25:47.978
Why can't you ask me how I'm doing?

01:25:49.463 --> 01:25:52.522
Instead you had to pile your stuff on me

01:25:52.523 --> 01:25:54.680
because I can handle it!

01:25:58.123 --> 01:25:59.682
I don't wanna handle it anymore.

01:25:59.683 --> 01:26:01.449
You get your shit together.

01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:03.409
You get it together, I'm out of here,

01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:04.953
and I'm not coming back!

01:26:06.971 --> 01:26:09.949
I'm not coming back and
you're not gonna have anybody

01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:12.169
to tell you that Chuck is a dick

01:26:12.170 --> 01:26:14.469
or that you deserve better
because you won't deserve better

01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:17.189
'cause you'll have lost the one person

01:26:17.190 --> 01:26:18.987
who cares about you the most.

01:26:24.052 --> 01:26:26.469
And I can't even look at you.

01:26:27.845 --> 01:26:28.678
I can't.

01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:52.273
I love you.

01:27:56.914 --> 01:27:58.007
Mal.

01:31:08.582 --> 01:31:10.332
Give me what is mine!
