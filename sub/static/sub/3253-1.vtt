00:33.891 --> 00:36.227
I know you.

00:36.435 --> 00:39.772
You had your own patch of the
playground by the chemistry labs,

00:39.980 --> 00:42.023
selling off bent dinner tickets.

00:43.691 --> 00:45.443
Expelled, weren't you?

00:45.652 --> 00:50.281
Something about an air rifle
and three female third-years?

00:50.490 --> 00:53.325
Hello?

00:54.326 --> 00:56.703
Silly fuck.

00:56.912 --> 00:59.373
Getting caught, I mean.

00:59.581 --> 01:02.459
If you're going to be a naughty boy,
you've got to be careful,

01:02.668 --> 01:04.961
or you'll end up here.

01:05.169 --> 01:08.047
Then I'll have to deal with you.

01:09.090 --> 01:13.844
You know me. Yes, you do.

01:14.053 --> 01:15.638
Honest John.

01:16.514 --> 01:19.641
Milk monitor, prefect...

01:21.351 --> 01:23.728
Would've made Head Boy if I'd stayed on.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.858
Old man put his foot down.

01:29.066 --> 01:32.403
Got to go out in the world, earn a crust.

01:35.531 --> 01:37.741
I don't give a toss
that you did some dodgy perfume

01:37.950 --> 01:40.828
and I'll turn a blind eye to the blow.

01:41.036 --> 01:45.790
But you have to admit the sheltered
accommodation was well out of order.

01:45.999 --> 01:49.085
Don't even start to think of denying it.

01:50.044 --> 01:54.089
I know you did the job.
You know you did the job.

01:54.298 --> 01:57.342
Even my grandma's goldfish knows it.

02:03.849 --> 02:06.434
It's a bit warm, isn't it?

02:06.642 --> 02:10.604
Another tropical September afternoon
in London's East End.

02:10.812 --> 02:14.358
Tell me you did it
and I'll send out for some lollies.

02:19.154 --> 02:21.990
Much better you cough.

02:22.199 --> 02:27.829
Give me a video, a stereo,
two bracelets and a telly.

02:28.038 --> 02:32.333
Fillin the necessaries and in
Half an hour you can be in the boozer

02:32.541 --> 02:35.502
bragging of how
you gave the Bill the run-around.

02:36.253 --> 02:38.505
Do us both a favour, eh?

02:38.714 --> 02:41.425
I need a clear-up and you need a break.

02:41.634 --> 02:45.720
You'll get six months suspended.
You'll be laughing.

02:48.514 --> 02:52.852
You know me. My name is John.

02:54.354 --> 03:00.150
I can be very nice, and
I can be very nasty.

03:01.735 --> 03:05.989
Either way I'm having a
statement out of you.

03:06.198 --> 03:07.949
Your choice.

03:08.991 --> 03:10.952
JOHN: Yes!

03:13.496 --> 03:16.290
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

03:16.499 --> 03:18.626
Looking for DC Brandon...

03:20.460 --> 03:21.795
Schofield's asked to see you.

03:22.003 --> 03:23.755
Chief Super reckons you're ripe for a job.

03:23.964 --> 03:27.384
I was beginning to think
he had it in for me.

03:29.135 --> 03:31.720
Wait 'til you hear what the job is.

03:33.013 --> 03:37.768
TV: Shadwell Town. 6.9.88, 4:07 pm.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.315
Targets 7 and 8 are named. 20.9.88.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.201
SCHOFIELD: All the
scenes have been recorded

03:45.214 --> 03:46.651
at The Kennel over
the past six months.

03:47.735 --> 03:50.864
- Kennel?
- Shadwell fans call their ground that.

03:51.072 --> 03:55.535
- Their nickname's "The Dogs".
- Their bite is worse than their bark.

03:56.285 --> 03:57.995
...6.07 pm.

03:58.203 --> 04:01.123
SCHOFIELD: We want you
in there with them. By the book.

04:01.331 --> 04:04.001
Day-to- day wack. Dates,
times, places, faces.

04:04.209 --> 04:07.296
- I thought we had a squad at Shadwell.
- Word went out on them.

04:07.504 --> 04:11.340
- Our targets will be suss of new faces.
- Your targets will be different.

04:11.549 --> 04:15.469
Someone is organising this lot.
We want generals, not foot soldiers.

04:19.807 --> 04:25.353
David Daley, motor mechanic.
Done 18 months of 4 years for GBH.

04:30.817 --> 04:33.485
Paul Funnell. Done six for manslaughter.

04:33.694 --> 04:38.282
Strangled a bloke with a Union Jack.
Said he did it as a joke.

04:41.869 --> 04:46.164
Wynton Mbula. Got his finger
everywhere - nothing sticks.

04:47.999 --> 04:52.462
Daley, Funnell, Mbula. My money says
it's them pushing the flags on the map.

04:52.670 --> 04:54.923
Why can't we do them
on what you've got there?

04:55.131 --> 04:56.841
They'd be out before the season end.

04:57.050 --> 04:59.801
We want their sentences
in years, not months.

05:00.010 --> 05:02.804
We want them on conspiracy.
We want their goolies

05:03.013 --> 05:07.726
pickled on a plate
for the Home Secretary. Got it?

05:08.435 --> 05:10.478
We've got a meeting with the previous team.

05:10.686 --> 05:14.524
- Detective Sergeant in six months.
- Don't got too excited.

05:14.732 --> 05:17.276
One minute you're flying
and the next you're grounded.

05:17.485 --> 05:21.447
I'm no plod. If I don't make Inspector
in five years, I'll try some other game.

05:21.656 --> 05:23.657
Last week I was in court on an arson,

05:23.865 --> 05:26.777
the week before I was
looking for a lost arm

05:26.790 --> 05:29.454
in a car crash. This
week it's football.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.708
Stone me! What did you walk into?

05:34.917 --> 05:36.293
Gold and black one.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.880
They sussed me.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.091
How come? You look the part.

05:42.299 --> 05:45.386
We don't look like
a bunch of tarts like you, anyhow.

05:45.594 --> 05:49.639
Some bloke I was at Hendon with
was on duty at The Kennel,

05:49.848 --> 05:53.226
and he gave me "How many stripes
have you got?" before I shut him up.

05:53.434 --> 05:55.186
- Arsehole.
- What did your target say?

05:55.395 --> 05:58.314
Nothing. They were as good as gold
All afternoon.

05:58.522 --> 06:00.357
'Til we got down to The Rock.

06:00.566 --> 06:04.319
Yeah, 'til after the game
and we got down to The Rock.

06:04.528 --> 06:06.864
- Then they had us out the back.
- Where's The Rock?

06:07.072 --> 06:10.409
- You'll find it, don't worry.
- Stay clear of The Rock.

06:10.617 --> 06:14.412
Bob, the landlord. He can sniff Bill as
soon as it walks through the door.

06:14.620 --> 06:16.747
He'll chew your bones for breakfast, son.

06:17.915 --> 06:19.792
CHARLIE: How did you
make contact with your targets?

06:20.001 --> 06:22.253
DANNY: Go to all the matches.
Hang around the boozers.

06:22.461 --> 06:26.631
Go on a pub crawl around Shadwell.
You'll soon come across them.

06:29.134 --> 06:31.928
You take the pubs on the right,
we take those on the left.

06:32.137 --> 06:37.725
At the end of the evening we'll meet
back at the nick and compare notes.

06:42.605 --> 06:44.481
DANNY: You'llsee enough to stuffthem,

06:44.690 --> 06:48.818
and what you don't see, you can guess.
Do you know what I mean?

06:51.404 --> 06:53.948
- What are you having?
- Half a stout.

06:55.950 --> 07:01.288
- I don't like drinking, John.
- Neither do I, but make an effort.

07:21.307 --> 07:25.393
CHARLIE: What's the matter
with you two? Can't take a drink?

07:34.611 --> 07:36.820
I'm alright, I'm alright.

07:41.408 --> 07:43.702
Jackpot!

07:45.913 --> 07:47.540
Have you sobered up?

07:47.748 --> 07:50.667
And me. Let's go to work.

07:54.963 --> 07:57.006
Two pints of lager, please.

08:07.850 --> 08:10.936
- Over in the corner. Nutters.
- Can it, Trevor.

08:31.204 --> 08:33.498
John. John!

08:36.168 --> 08:38.460
- What the fuck are you staring at?
- Nothing, mate.

08:38.669 --> 08:42.673
- Calm down. Have a drink.
- Tell your mate to fuck off.

08:42.881 --> 08:45.259
- I don't like being stared at.
- Fucking right!

08:45.467 --> 08:48.804
Don't give us hassle.
We're Shadwell like you, alright?

08:49.013 --> 08:51.222
You reckon? Who are we playing tomorrow?

08:52.515 --> 08:55.560
- Pentland, away.
- I'm not asking you!

08:55.768 --> 08:59.439
- When's our next home game?
- JOHN: Wednesday, mate. Grimsby.

08:59.647 --> 09:03.108
- Let him answer.
- Who did we sell to Wimbledon?

09:04.902 --> 09:06.403
- Carera.
- You!

09:06.612 --> 09:09.656
- Carera.
- Well done, Brain of Britain!

09:09.865 --> 09:12.534
- Bloody good riddance.
- Trev...

09:12.743 --> 09:14.744
He's the best player we over had!

09:14.952 --> 09:17.580
Fuck off, mate. If he'd gone
any slower, he'd have grown roots.

09:17.788 --> 09:20.583
- JOHN: Trev...
- Hang on, he's got a point.

09:22.585 --> 09:25.505
You've got to admit.
He did have some flair, though.

09:25.713 --> 09:27.589
Oh, yeah. I wouldn't deny that, no.

09:27.797 --> 09:30.091
For a white bloke he was pretty skilful.

09:30.759 --> 09:34.888
- For a whitey, yeah. You're right.
- You prat!

09:48.734 --> 09:53.446
I know they're fucking Neanderthals,
But we've got to face them.

10:00.245 --> 10:02.121
I thought we might bump into you lot.

10:04.289 --> 10:05.916
So you're really Shadwell?

10:06.124 --> 10:08.961
Of course. Ignore him,
he's new to the game.

10:11.171 --> 10:15.259
One Josh Carera! There's
only one Josh Carera!

10:16.175 --> 10:18.219
- Do you fancy a game?
- Yeah, I'm on.

10:18.427 --> 10:20.680
Five cards, two changes, no trumps.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.015
Tell your mate he can play.

10:23.224 --> 10:27.019
- I hope he's got some cash on him.
- Yeah. Cut him in, deal him out.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.313
When do I over lose?

10:33.775 --> 10:36.528
TRAIN DRIVER: We'll shortly be
arriving at Pentland...

10:36.736 --> 10:38.780
ALL: Yeah!

10:48.289 --> 10:51.458
You lucky fucker! We're playing
All the way back, you know.

10:51.667 --> 10:55.170
Sorry, boys. Must've hit a lucky streak.

11:50.095 --> 11:54.349
At least there's no Pentland.
I reckon they've bottled.

11:54.557 --> 11:56.309
You don't know your arse, son.

11:56.518 --> 12:00.563
You'll have had enough of Pentland
before the day's out.

12:51.152 --> 12:55.155
ALL: # Shadwell never, never, never
shall lose face

12:57.782 --> 13:00.577
There it is, the ground.

13:00.785 --> 13:03.454
I don't give a fuck, John,
to be quite honest.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.794
Had some of your lot in lockup.

13:11.962 --> 13:15.841
- My lot?
- Wapping fans, trashed a nightclub.

13:16.049 --> 13:18.218
They aren't my lot. My lot are Shadwell.

13:18.427 --> 13:21.721
- They're all the same, though.
- That's what they say about us.

13:21.929 --> 13:25.266
- You are enjoying your meal, I hope.
- Yes. Thank you, Giuseppe.

13:25.475 --> 13:29.228
- The scallops are marvellous.
- I have a special dessert for you.

13:29.437 --> 13:32.272
- Could we have another of these?
- I don't want any more.

13:32.481 --> 13:36.234
- I do, though. Another half-bottle.
- Certainly.

13:37.903 --> 13:39.738
What did you do all day?

13:41.156 --> 13:43.658
JOHN: Look at me!

13:45.326 --> 13:47.828
Tell me what you see.

13:48.037 --> 13:53.459
EDDIE: It's you, ain't it? John. A bloke.

13:53.667 --> 13:57.504
- No.
- An ordinary everyday bloke.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.927
- Now what do you see?
- Me.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.179
- It's Eddie.
- It's Eddie, John.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.639
- A geezer.
- You're looking, but not seeing.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.475
Not a bloke, not a geezer,
not one of the lads.

14:11.683 --> 14:15.521
Know what I see? Bill.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.898
- It's what we are.
- No, Trevor, it's not.

14:18.106 --> 14:22.068
He's got a point, Sarge.
We are supposed to be Shadwell.

14:22.276 --> 14:25.947
Then it's bobble hats and rattles
All round then, isn't it?

14:26.155 --> 14:28.199
Who's this?

14:28.407 --> 14:30.743
It's a dead ringer for Mr Magoo.

14:38.333 --> 14:41.628
JOHN: Who scored the own goal
that ended our chances of promotion?

14:41.837 --> 14:43.588
- TREVOR: Dempsey.
- EDDIE: A right corker.

14:43.797 --> 14:47.842
He flights it back to the goalkeeper,
to Clark in goal, but he's in the sun.

14:48.050 --> 14:51.345
Clark sees fuck all. The ball bounces
once over his head and into the goal.

14:51.554 --> 14:53.889
Nolan sticks Dempsey
straight on the transfer list.

14:54.098 --> 14:57.017
Bournemouth had him. No, Portsmouth.
50,000.

14:57.226 --> 14:59.936
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

15:00.145 --> 15:03.690
Next season we draw Portsmouth
in the Zenith Cup. No, Simod.

15:03.898 --> 15:06.609
- And who scores against us?
- Bobby fucking Dempsey!

15:06.818 --> 15:11.113
Brilliant ruck with Pompey. They
jumped in the river rather than face us.

15:11.321 --> 15:15.159
I've got one. What's the biggest
post-war attendance at The Kennel?

15:15.367 --> 15:18.203
- Man U, League Cup quarterfinal. 27,000.
- No.

15:18.412 --> 15:21.707
- It's a trick question, then.
- Rod Stewart, Now Year's Eve, 1980.

15:21.914 --> 15:24.834
- More than 30,000 paying customers.
- Smart-arse!

15:25.042 --> 15:27.795
- Anyone know where we're going?
- This is John's patch.

15:28.004 --> 15:30.673
- Never said you were Shadwell.
- Was milked here.

15:30.882 --> 15:32.633
My gran lived here.

15:32.842 --> 15:36.011
If you visited her on Saturdays,
you could hear the Shadwell roar.

15:36.219 --> 15:38.430
- Closest I've come.
- Here's one.

15:38.638 --> 15:42.350
Which team knocked Arsenal out of
the FA Cup 1974-75?

15:42.559 --> 15:44.686
- Having a laugh, ain't you?
- Bolger in goal.

15:44.895 --> 15:47.771
- Tell him Trevor.
- Dobson, Boniface, Fisk, Hirst,

15:47.980 --> 15:52.193
Austin, Stonebridge, Whitfield, Kurtz.

15:52.401 --> 15:55.988
Hyde and Royston up front,
Matheson sub, unused.

15:56.197 --> 15:59.616
- Is he right?
- How should I know?

16:02.118 --> 16:05.288
Welcome to The Kennel, lads.

16:32.021 --> 16:35.774
Come on, you Shadwell,
got those northern nonces.

16:36.650 --> 16:40.362
CROWD: You're gonna got
your fucking heads kicked in!

16:40.570 --> 16:44.116
You're gonna got your
fucking heads kicked in!

16:44.324 --> 16:47.743
You're gonna got your
fucking heads kicked in!

16:47.952 --> 16:51.747
You're gonna got your
fucking heads kicked in!

16:58.921 --> 17:03.216
Not a lot to show. Bit of blow on
the terraces, a few coins chucked.

17:03.424 --> 17:07.804
- Are you finished John?
- What about the guy with the hip-flask?

17:08.012 --> 17:10.181
Do us a favour!

17:10.390 --> 17:13.474
Come on, John. It's a team effort.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.980
- John?
- Do you know what we've got to do?

17:18.188 --> 17:21.817
- We've got to got in at The Rock.
- Leave it out!

17:22.025 --> 17:25.236
- The Rock's a minefield for Bill.
- Exactly.

17:25.819 --> 17:29.282
It's a safe house for the top boys.
They won't be in the sweetshop.

17:29.490 --> 17:32.410
- You saw what happened to the others.
- They ain't us.

17:32.618 --> 17:36.414
- What about the landlord?
- We ease ourselves in.

17:37.664 --> 17:42.335
Me and Trev can use our cover.
We're painter-decorators, right?

17:43.670 --> 17:47.048
JOHN: We'll go there lunch-times at
first, say we're working in the area.

17:47.257 --> 17:49.800
Get our faces known.

18:00.978 --> 18:02.937
What can I do you for?

18:04.647 --> 18:07.525
JOHN: Get on first-name terms
with the bar staff..

18:07.734 --> 18:11.863
Give them some chat. Have them
Pour our drinks before we've ordered.

18:13.906 --> 18:16.325
Soon it's John and Trev,
the painter-decorators.

18:16.533 --> 18:18.410
"Pint of the usual, love,
and a steak and kidney.

18:18.619 --> 18:21.455
"-A few more chips than yesterday.
- Cheeky so-and-so.

18:21.663 --> 18:23.373
"Another round, lads?"

18:24.625 --> 18:29.295
Once they know us,
we'll pop in early on a Friday night.

18:29.504 --> 18:31.964
Just for a quick one.

19:09.207 --> 19:11.376
The usual, lads?

19:14.254 --> 19:16.338
Are you two Dogs, then?

19:36.399 --> 19:40.152
Edwards, you geriatric retard.
Where's your fucking walking stick?

19:40.360 --> 19:44.739
- You want to paint it white, you nonce!
- Help him out, for fuck's sake!

19:44.948 --> 19:48.785
- Help him out the fucking front gate!
- Make sure you lock it after!

19:48.994 --> 19:52.246
Pick a decent side, Nolan. You
couldn't pick your own fucking nose.

19:52.455 --> 19:55.833
- Not even if it was in front of your face.
- Better than up the Chairman's arse!

19:56.041 --> 19:59.462
- That's not where he keeps his money.
- Not where everyone could got at it!

19:59.670 --> 20:04.841
The ball, Edwards! Kicking up
the pitch is the groundsman's work!

20:05.049 --> 20:09.471
Best pass he's made.
Only trouble was it was a lump of turf.

20:09.679 --> 20:12.265
We've had enough sods on the pitch
without his help.

20:12.474 --> 20:16.935
You're playing on drugs,
and I don't mean speed!

20:20.981 --> 20:24.151
- Tripped over his laces.
- Won us a free kick, though.

20:24.359 --> 20:26.111
Only thing we'll win this season.

20:26.320 --> 20:30.239
- Oh, no! Who lines up to take it?
- Gerry fucking Edwards.

20:30.448 --> 20:32.825
He couldn't score in a fucking brothel!

20:34.619 --> 20:36.913
YEAH!

20:38.539 --> 20:42.542
CROWD: One Gerry Edwards1
There's only one Gerry Edwards!

20:42.751 --> 20:48.048
One Gerry Edwards!
There's only one Gerry Edwards!

20:48.256 --> 20:52.219
One Gerry Edwards!
There's only one Gerry Edwards!

20:52.427 --> 20:57.348
One Gerry Edwards!
There's only one Gerry Edwards!

20:57.556 --> 21:00.935
Shadwell, Shadwell!

21:01.143 --> 21:03.813
Wankers! Fuck off!

21:04.021 --> 21:07.774
- Have I seen you before somewhere?
- The Rock's our local.

21:07.982 --> 21:10.610
- Must be it, then?
- How long've you been going here?

21:10.819 --> 21:14.989
- A couple of years. And you?
- Born and bred, since schooldays.

21:15.198 --> 21:18.700
- Wouldn't put up with them otherwise.
- You fucking Arsenal scum!

21:18.909 --> 21:23.205
You go up for a pint
and end up with a load of Gooners.

21:23.413 --> 21:25.415
Nick, mate. Duck...

21:31.963 --> 21:34.799
- Gumbo, is it your round or what?
- It's my shout.

21:35.007 --> 21:36.884
No, let Ponce-Bonce get them.

21:37.093 --> 21:40.596
- It's alright, I got paid today.
- NIK: Yeah? Makes a fucking change.

21:40.805 --> 21:43.890
MARTIN: Mind the table, Gumbo.

21:44.099 --> 21:49.312
90 nicker a week he makes.
Packing jars of gherkins into boxes.

21:49.521 --> 21:52.023
He's fucking useless.

21:52.232 --> 21:55.317
Last year his old girl pops her clogs.
He falls apart.

21:55.526 --> 21:59.029
Can't boil an egg, fries himself
changing a light bulb.

21:59.238 --> 22:03.617
He's a silly runt. Every time he gets
into a ruck he loses another tooth.

22:03.826 --> 22:07.078
We're running a book
as to when he loses his last one.

22:07.287 --> 22:10.206
I'm down for September,
so I'm looking after him 'til then.

22:14.711 --> 22:17.255
Gumbo!

22:17.464 --> 22:21.884
- We fucking love you, Gumbo.
- About fucking time.

22:34.979 --> 22:39.942
- That's it, you're nicked!
- You heard nothing, alright?

22:40.777 --> 22:44.362
- What's the matter with you?
- Sorry, John.

22:48.325 --> 22:52.204
ALL:# Shadwell never, never, never
shall lose face

22:52.412 --> 22:55.956
# Though you hate us we
couldn't give a toss

22:56.165 --> 22:59.919
Shadwell always, always,
always are the boss

23:57.263 --> 23:59.014
MARIE: Are you alright, love?

23:59.223 --> 24:03.519
I would be alright if there was something
fucking edible left out for me to eat.

24:04.895 --> 24:10.150
Don't you over, ever,
speak to me like that again.

24:10.358 --> 24:13.403
I'm sorry. I'm being a prat.

24:14.612 --> 24:17.574
- What do you look like?
- I had to have a drink.

24:17.782 --> 24:20.993
- It's how you got in with them.
- I hope it was worth it.

24:21.201 --> 24:23.996
It went like a dream. Flying I am, Marie.

24:24.204 --> 24:27.332
I'm on Drugs or Vice
after this, I tell you.

24:28.500 --> 24:32.171
How does "DS Brandon" sound?

24:32.379 --> 24:35.757
A lot better than "where's my effing tea!"

24:41.763 --> 24:46.266
It's so bloody lovely to come home to you.

24:49.811 --> 24:52.189
Fucking day it was...

25:03.032 --> 25:05.242
- The usual, boys?
- Lynda.

25:05.451 --> 25:09.038
What's been happening
in my own boozer? I'm a stranger.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.790
Sorry, Bob. You don't know
John and Trev, do you?

25:11.998 --> 25:14.876
- No, I don't.
- They do up houses.

25:15.085 --> 25:18.963
- Bob's been on holiday.
- Bollocks, I've been inside.

25:19.172 --> 25:23.175
What houses? Here they
knock them down, not do them up.

25:23.383 --> 25:26.011
Down the docks. Being tarted up a treat.

25:32.309 --> 25:34.685
Uncle Bob's a big softie
when you got to know him.

25:34.894 --> 25:38.022
Uncle Bob? Stone me, Lynda,
there's not much family resemblance.

25:38.231 --> 25:41.651
I'm heiress to a pub, mate.
You watch yourself.

25:41.859 --> 25:44.278
He's got a wobbler on.

25:44.487 --> 25:48.782
First day out, he invests in
some chairs and tables for outside

25:48.990 --> 25:50.867
and someone's had them off.

25:51.076 --> 25:54.371
What's he like when it's something serious?

25:59.375 --> 26:03.462
MARIE: There's nothing wrong with
large families, if that's what you want.

26:03.671 --> 26:06.841
I'd like another two. We need
a bigger place, don't we, Eddie?

26:07.049 --> 26:09.677
- It's not the time to look for houses.
- When is?

26:09.885 --> 26:12.554
Either the house is too small
Or the mortgage is too big.

26:12.762 --> 26:15.682
- I'm happy where I am.
- Yeah.

26:15.890 --> 26:17.581
Charlie's still paying
for his ex's place.

26:17.594 --> 26:19.144
STEF: She's got
her head screwed on.

26:19.352 --> 26:23.188
- And her feet under the table.
- Don't sulk.

26:23.397 --> 26:27.526
Trevor said he'd live in a tent
as long as I was with him.

26:27.735 --> 26:30.279
ALL: Aaah!

26:30.487 --> 26:32.906
I'm not thinking of kids
until I got to Inspector.

26:33.115 --> 26:36.492
- Eh?
- Charlie wishes he'd waited.

26:36.701 --> 26:39.704
- Excuse me a moment.
- Are you checking it's still there?

26:39.912 --> 26:42.540
Won't be long.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.919
- Sorry.
- Contagious, is it?

26:53.383 --> 26:55.677
Sorry.

27:05.561 --> 27:08.981
- CHARLIE: Midchester tomorrow.
- JOHN: We'll stuff them.

27:09.190 --> 27:12.109
CHARLIE: 5-0 at least.
Their goalie's crap.

27:12.317 --> 27:14.527
JOHN: Come on, you Shadwell!

27:17.822 --> 27:21.159
EDDIE: Come on, you Dogs!

27:23.161 --> 27:25.079
TREVOR: Murder them we will.

27:25.287 --> 27:29.041
ALL: # We are Shadwell
The Kennel is our place

27:29.249 --> 27:33.128
# Shadwell never, never, never
shall lose face

27:37.757 --> 27:40.802
Fucking grow up, for fuck's sake!

27:46.349 --> 27:49.226
Mind your backs, boys.

27:50.852 --> 27:53.814
Bob says word is the Brummies
Want to take out a pub.

27:54.022 --> 27:56.441
I hope they pick us. Here you are, Gumbo.

27:56.650 --> 27:59.236
Trev's just been telling
us about your kid, John.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.987
Oh, has he?

28:02.196 --> 28:06.325
- Never said you were a dad, John.
- It's not something you shout about.

28:06.534 --> 28:10.204
- What's his name, then?
- Didn't Trev tell you?

28:11.580 --> 28:13.915
James Wilson Hibbin Chatfield
Edwards Hutcheson Clark

28:14.124 --> 28:17.001
Edmonds Ball Cox Cummins.

28:18.002 --> 28:20.088
Fucking brilliant, naming your sprog after

28:20.296 --> 28:22.424
the side that got promoted
to the Second Division.

28:22.632 --> 28:24.759
You want to bring him down to The Kennel.

28:24.968 --> 28:28.679
Yeah, bring him down here, John.
Your missus wouldn't mind.

28:31.974 --> 28:34.643
Brummie bastards!

28:36.687 --> 28:41.482
- It ain't The Rock they're after.
- I'm finding out where they do go.

28:41.691 --> 28:43.985
Hang on, John.

30:02.391 --> 30:05.226
Bob says tonight you don't
Put your hand in your pocket.

30:05.434 --> 30:09.939
- Cheers, Lynda.
- When are you going to ask me out?

30:10.147 --> 30:12.650
Don't say nothing. Wait 'til you're sober.

30:12.858 --> 30:15.611
Set up weeks ago this meet.
Good ruck before the game.

30:15.820 --> 30:18.154
Only trouble, the Brummies
couldn't got off the coach.

30:18.363 --> 30:23.493
Some prat leads a charge.
John, do you know who that might he?

30:27.747 --> 30:29.331
I love you!

30:30.332 --> 30:34.294
# Though you hate us we
couldn't give a toss

30:34.503 --> 30:36.171
Oi!

30:37.715 --> 30:40.259
You think you're the cream
on top of a bottle of piss,

30:40.466 --> 30:42.260
but any more row and you're on report.

30:42.468 --> 30:45.388
- Sorry, Sergeant.
- My lot in lockup are better behaved.

30:45.972 --> 30:48.474
Sorry, Sergeant.
We've had a very stressful night.

30:48.683 --> 30:51.728
Yeah. It won't happen again, Sarge.

30:55.188 --> 30:58.150
You've got to draw the line somewhere.

31:01.403 --> 31:04.740
This is no good, coming back
to the nick after a day's work.

31:04.947 --> 31:09.493
- We need a proper office.
- And proper backup. We're winging it.

31:09.702 --> 31:12.621
- Fucking right.
- JOHN: Down to you, Trev.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.291
You're the sergeant.

31:19.044 --> 31:22.881
- What's the word on the meet today?
- You've not seen Bob?

31:23.089 --> 31:26.301
Half-one, Lumber's Arms, city centre.

31:26.509 --> 31:30.304
I'd have thought
Bob would've put you in the picture.

31:32.556 --> 31:37.019
Oi, Gumbo! Get your tools out.
Get your tools out.

31:37.227 --> 31:40.439
# Get your tools out! Get your tools out!

31:40.647 --> 31:43.149
# Get your tools out for the lads!

31:43.357 --> 31:47.153
# Get your tools out for the lads!

31:48.571 --> 31:51.574
Gumbo, you're fucking nicked, my son!

31:57.412 --> 31:59.289
Oi, look!

32:02.000 --> 32:04.711
Football Intelligence?

32:06.004 --> 32:08.422
DS Jones Shadwell District.

32:25.105 --> 32:28.108
We've been done over.
Half of Midlands' Bill to greet us.

32:28.316 --> 32:31.860
I've been grassed by some fucker.
He's dead when I sniff him.

32:32.069 --> 32:36.281
It's a bloody shame.
I was looking forward to a good ruck.

32:42.454 --> 32:44.414
Are you sure?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.628
Another large one.

32:57.634 --> 33:01.179
- Alright, Bob?
- Fucking no, we're talking.

33:01.722 --> 33:03.181
Sorry, mate.

33:03.390 --> 33:06.268
I'm sick of setting up meets
only for Old Bill to show.

33:06.476 --> 33:11.147
And me! Bob, I swear on my mother's life
I wouldn't grass anyone.

33:11.355 --> 33:12.815
Shut the fuck up!

33:13.023 --> 33:16.402
- We know it ain't you, Gumbo.
- Some fucker, though, innit?

33:16.610 --> 33:18.654
I thought we'd had off all the Bill here.

33:18.863 --> 33:21.698
- NIK: They're like maggots.
- I'm sick of this.

33:21.906 --> 33:23.867
Three mates were set up last time.

33:24.075 --> 33:27.871
We'll crucify them in court, though.
Their evidence is bollocks, innit?

33:28.079 --> 33:30.206
Geoff Marshall is getting
married one Saturday.

33:30.415 --> 33:32.708
They've got him involved
in a knifing in Bristol.

33:32.916 --> 33:36.045
He's got a video of the wedding!

33:36.253 --> 33:39.214
Dave Armstrong was set up for a burglary.

33:39.423 --> 33:42.176
He was in police custody at the time!

33:42.384 --> 33:45.636
All the same,
there's Bill or grass or snouts here.

33:45.845 --> 33:49.140
Our job is to smoke them
out and snuff them.

33:49.348 --> 33:52.477
- Fucking rip their faces off!
- Yeah, Bob!

33:53.686 --> 33:58.065
ALL: # We are Shadwell
The Kennel is our place

33:58.398 --> 34:02.736
#Shadwell never, never, never
shall lose face

34:02.944 --> 34:07.282
# Though you hate us
we couldn't give a toss

34:07.491 --> 34:11.994
#Shadwell always, always, always
are the boss

34:18.208 --> 34:20.418
Alright, boys?

34:21.960 --> 34:25.507
Alright? Alright?

34:27.467 --> 34:29.761
Alright?

34:33.972 --> 34:38.310
- Who scored the most goals last year?
- It wasn't you, was it?

34:44.565 --> 34:46.442
Shadwell Army!

34:46.650 --> 34:50.071
- He's got to sort it out.
- We're going down now, aren't we?

34:50.279 --> 34:51.697
NIK: We need a new striker.

34:51.906 --> 34:58.787
Reckon you're Shadwell? Name
every goalkeeper since World War I.

34:58.995 --> 35:01.289
I can.

35:03.834 --> 35:06.628
Alright, I'll give you something easier.

35:06.837 --> 35:11.590
TREVOR: What Shadwell player has
the highest number of international caps?

35:14.427 --> 35:18.597
Sorry. Shit-for-brains has had too
Much juice. Won't bother you again.

35:18.806 --> 35:21.976
- What the fuck are you on?
- Alright, Trev?

35:22.183 --> 35:24.936
- Getting a bit boozed up.
- Can't handle his juice.

35:26.938 --> 35:28.273
Ow!

35:30.066 --> 35:32.318
I'll fucking kill him!

35:38.657 --> 35:40.200
Yellow card, John!

35:42.077 --> 35:46.248
I was in there. She fancies me,
Lynda. She's always looking over.

35:46.457 --> 35:49.375
Get in the fucking motor
before you do more damage!

35:49.584 --> 35:52.795
- I'm doing my job!
- Well, don't!

35:58.509 --> 36:01.970
You forget who's in charge.
It's me you take orders from.

36:02.179 --> 36:05.557
Bollocks! You're incapable.

36:09.770 --> 36:14.690
Try looking at yourself in a mirror!
You're a fucking hooligan, John!

36:18.194 --> 36:20.071
You don't scare me, John.

36:35.126 --> 36:39.880
You're off the squad, if for no other
reason than your dangerous driving!

36:40.089 --> 36:42.508
I'll have you in uniform by Monday!

36:42.716 --> 36:45.219
Morning, Trevor.
What's the matter with you two?

36:45.427 --> 36:47.471
JOHN: I'm fine. It's him.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.723
He grasses on me,
throws his weight around in the pub,

36:50.932 --> 36:55.061
blows our cred with Bob and tries
to act the caveman with Lynda!

36:55.269 --> 36:58.940
- What's this about John leaving?
- He's not leaving, I'm sacking him!

36:59.148 --> 37:02.192
- So help me, you...
- You can't do it, Trev.

37:02.401 --> 37:05.654
I can do what I like! I'm the Sergeant!

37:05.862 --> 37:09.533
You can't hack it. Fuck
off onto Traffic Control!

37:10.909 --> 37:14.745
Well, that's that, then.
It's out of my hands.

37:14.954 --> 37:17.998
I think I'll take a holiday.

37:47.026 --> 37:50.987
- Are you alright?
- How's Trev?

37:51.195 --> 37:54.198
His glasses are broken. He'll live.

37:55.366 --> 37:58.077
Better come out and face it, mate.

38:21.891 --> 38:23.768
I'm sorry, Jonesy.

38:26.644 --> 38:28.521
I'm sorry as well, John.

38:28.730 --> 38:32.192
- I was out of order.
- So was I.

38:34.444 --> 38:38.989
- I don't want you off the squad.
- I realise you have to carry the can.

38:39.198 --> 38:41.575
Trev, you can't pull rank
when you're undercover.

38:41.784 --> 38:46.789
- You're painter-decorators.
- Trevor and John, mates

38:46.997 --> 38:49.875
Mates, like they say.

38:50.667 --> 38:52.669
Right. That's that, then.

38:52.877 --> 38:56.464
Back to civilisation. I need some kip.

38:57.757 --> 39:00.385
- TREVOR: Tell you what, though, John.
- Trev?

39:00.593 --> 39:04.888
If you hadn't run off,
I would've kicked your head in.

40:31.926 --> 40:35.180
Right, who the fucking hell are you?

40:35.388 --> 40:40.434
- I'm John, and this is Trevor.
- John and Trevor, bollocks!

40:40.642 --> 40:43.645
You're fucking Old Bill, mate.

40:49.485 --> 40:51.320
Say that again.

40:52.488 --> 40:55.740
Gumbo let drop that when we
clumped them Gooners,

40:55.948 --> 40:58.159
your mate gave it the
old Starsky and Hutch.

40:58.368 --> 41:01.120
- I said it was a joke.
- Shut up, Gumbo.

41:01.329 --> 41:04.540
Gumbo's right, you nonce.
He was putting the wind up them.

41:04.749 --> 41:09.378
And who's seen making phone calls
on the way to Westley?

41:09.586 --> 41:11.797
Your mate Trevor.

41:12.005 --> 41:16.885
And when we got there,
we got a reception from fucking plod.

41:17.094 --> 41:19.011
He was phoning his mum.

41:19.220 --> 41:21.806
- My mum.
- This house...

41:22.014 --> 41:25.059
This house in Catford
you're supposed to be decorating.

41:25.267 --> 41:28.396
Me and Nick popped round
to take you out for a pint.

41:28.604 --> 41:33.274
- Where the hell were you?
- Doing up the house before.

41:33.483 --> 41:37.654
- That's what I said.
- No, this ain't fucking right.

41:37.862 --> 41:40.532
You turn up out of nowhere.
No one's heard of you.

41:40.740 --> 41:43.242
You got all friendly with everyone

41:43.450 --> 41:47.663
and suddenly there's Bill in the way
every time we arrange a ruck.

41:47.871 --> 41:49.289
What are you saying?

41:49.498 --> 41:52.418
I'm fucking saying, you two-bob wanker,

41:52.626 --> 41:56.004
that you and you are fucking Old Bill!

41:56.212 --> 42:00.967
I don't take that from any runt.
You and me, outside. Now!

42:05.847 --> 42:08.932
I can smell Old Bill.
Smell it here, I don't.

42:09.141 --> 42:11.435
He doesn't come over like old Bill, Mark.

42:11.643 --> 42:18.482
- He would have shat himself by now.
- You utter fucking wanker.

42:37.584 --> 42:42.797
John, mate. I'm sorry. I'm just
a bit uptight with the trial coming up.

42:43.005 --> 42:47.801
- What trial?
- You know, my mates the Bill set up.

42:48.010 --> 42:51.347
Bob sorted me out, though.

42:53.682 --> 42:56.434
Can I buy you a pint?

43:05.777 --> 43:10.614
- Ain't my fucking round.
- Come on, Gumbo!

43:10.822 --> 43:13.116
Give it a press, Gum.

43:20.414 --> 43:22.625
- He fucking guessed it!
- No, I know it.

43:22.833 --> 43:27.630
- John! It's your go, mate.
- John, mate. Have a go.

43:40.141 --> 43:43.979
- Go on, mate.
- Go on, John.

43:52.194 --> 43:54.989
Go on, have a guess.

43:59.909 --> 44:04.163
- Oi, that's brand new!
- What's wrong? It's only a game.

44:04.372 --> 44:06.624
- You've told them, you fucking runt!
- No, I ain't.

44:06.833 --> 44:09.042
- Everyone's laughing!
- I'm not laughing.

44:09.251 --> 44:12.421
- TREVOR: John, I ain't said nothing.
- Ain't my fault.

44:12.629 --> 44:14.715
Loads of people can't read or write.

44:14.923 --> 44:18.135
- I don't expect you to take the piss.
- I ain't, John. Honest.

44:18.343 --> 44:21.637
- TREVOR: What do you mean?
- He wasn't taking the piss.

44:21.887 --> 44:25.141
Can't read or write? How do you manage?

44:25.349 --> 44:29.103
He does it for me. He reads for me,
I slap people for him. No more though!

44:29.312 --> 44:33.024
That's you and me finished!

44:33.231 --> 44:37.110
Sorry, mate. We'll back you up
when he's chilled out a bit.

44:37.319 --> 44:39.446
Stone me. The poor fucker
can't read or write

44:39.654 --> 44:41.990
and here's you accusing
him of being Old Bill!

44:43.033 --> 44:44.367
For fuck's sake!

44:51.040 --> 44:54.001
The man done well! I'm impressed.

45:00.465 --> 45:04.385
SCHOFIELD: Used to be a paint
factory before the firm went bankrupt.

45:04.594 --> 45:08.139
We're going to use it as a filing centre
when you are through.

45:08.348 --> 45:11.725
- This is what I call an office.
- Look what they've left behind.

45:11.933 --> 45:16.104
John and Trev, painter-decorators,
are in business at last.

45:17.022 --> 45:21.401
You'll find your requests for stationery,
ID and the rest on your desks

45:21.610 --> 45:23.778
- Pagers?
- Very funny.

45:23.986 --> 45:26.572
Driving licences, medical
cards, UB40s, the lot.

45:26.781 --> 45:29.950
Look, John. Your criminal record.

45:33.454 --> 45:36.790
Truancy, theft, juvenile court,

45:36.998 --> 45:40.961
detention centre, do a runner,
two housebreakings,

45:41.169 --> 45:43.838
assault and affray, then
assault on a copper,

45:44.047 --> 45:46.091
suspended sentence, heavy fine.

45:46.299 --> 45:47.675
Don't mess with him.

45:49.051 --> 45:51.512
Fucking right.

46:18.870 --> 46:20.288
Yeah!

46:47.355 --> 46:50.065
Oh, fuck it!

46:54.862 --> 46:56.196
What?

47:07.457 --> 47:09.667
I said "what?"

47:15.505 --> 47:16.840
Fat pig.

47:20.135 --> 47:21.970
If you've got something to fucking say...

47:22.179 --> 47:26.974
"Fuck, fuck, fuck!"
That's all I ever hear from you!

47:28.517 --> 47:33.522
The more you say it, the less able
you are to do it. Now, why is that?

47:38.401 --> 47:40.654
Don't look at me like that. You scare me.

47:48.828 --> 47:51.330
What are you going to do? Beat me up?

47:51.538 --> 47:53.624
What?

48:07.136 --> 48:10.390
Alright, then. Alright.

49:00.102 --> 49:02.521
I can't look at you.

49:03.730 --> 49:07.108
I don't know what's happening to us.

49:09.235 --> 49:11.696
It's not right.

49:12.905 --> 49:19.828
What's got you so upset?
What's wrong with being happy?

49:55.361 --> 49:57.947
We can go up, I tell you.

49:58.155 --> 50:00.741
Nolan wants to buy a
couple of decent players.

50:00.950 --> 50:03.786
He can't afford the bus fares,
let alone the players.

50:03.993 --> 50:07.747
No, no, no! You go bargaining
in the lower divisions,

50:07.956 --> 50:10.500
got a couple of likely lads off the YTS.

50:10.708 --> 50:14.212
- I mean, look at Carera.
- Best player we over had.

50:15.713 --> 50:20.050
Think about it, though.
The Dogs in the First Division.

50:20.258 --> 50:24.262
Playing at Anfield, Old
Trafford, Highbury...

50:24.471 --> 50:27.224
- In your dreams.
- Fuck off, Charlie Bowers.

50:27.432 --> 50:31.143
- I'm not some creeping wallflower.
- No, you're more like poison ivy.

50:31.352 --> 50:35.898
Get away from this bar, or it's
the Fred Flintstone's for you tonight.

50:36.107 --> 50:41.444
Isn't she lovely? And she's mine. All mine.

50:41.653 --> 50:44.281
The Fred Flintstone's, Ed?

50:45.407 --> 50:48.076
Wilma!

50:55.207 --> 50:58.252
- Having another, John?
- What'll it be, boys?

50:58.460 --> 51:01.005
You should know,
you've been serving us all night.

51:01.213 --> 51:04.508
Whisky, mate. Doubles. Have one yourself.

51:06.342 --> 51:10.430
- There's no need for it, John.
- Of course not, Trev.

51:15.184 --> 51:16.853
Ta.

51:18.478 --> 51:20.814
Here's to it.

51:31.490 --> 51:34.201
Marie's looking nice tonight.

51:43.501 --> 51:46.546
Did I tell you Moira's left me?

51:50.383 --> 51:53.178
We should never have sold Carera.

51:53.386 --> 51:56.305
What do you reckon?
A couple more here for appearance's sake,

51:56.513 --> 51:59.016
then I'll drop off Marie
and we'll go down The Rock.

51:59.224 --> 52:01.894
It's Christmas Eve!
Shouldn't you and Marie...

52:02.102 --> 52:03.437
Are you up for it?

52:06.773 --> 52:09.859
#Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way

52:10.068 --> 52:13.821
# Oh, what fun it is to stay
when Shadwell's on their way

52:14.030 --> 52:17.700
#Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way

52:17.909 --> 52:22.079
# Oh, what fun it is to stay
when Shadwell's on their way

52:34.632 --> 52:37.593
Who did the decorations, then? You?

52:55.609 --> 52:58.070
You're not like the rest.

53:02.908 --> 53:05.327
You can walk me home, if you want.

53:05.536 --> 53:10.748
Lynda. You're lovely, you're
really lovely, but...

53:10.957 --> 53:14.544
See what's in your Christmas stocking.

53:14.752 --> 53:18.506
I can't. How can I?

53:20.299 --> 53:22.884
Off you go, then.
Don't waste any more of my time.

53:23.093 --> 53:27.931
This ain't me. I ain't like this.

53:28.932 --> 53:31.393
Are you coming back or what?

53:33.144 --> 53:34.854
Sorry.

53:53.872 --> 53:56.082
Merry Christmas, John.

54:57.846 --> 55:00.933
TREVOR: Good Christmas, John?

55:01.141 --> 55:03.477
JOHN: Will you fuck off!

55:06.272 --> 55:09.066
CHARLIE: You don't think
Bob's Mr Fix-it, do you?

55:09.275 --> 55:12.944
EDDIE: Mr Know-it, yeah.
Everyone talks to Bob,

55:13.152 --> 55:18.074
but he couldn't organise his shit
into the pan without someone's help.

55:18.283 --> 55:22.619
My money's on Wynton.
He's always jabbering into his mobile.

55:25.330 --> 55:27.416
What do you think, John?

55:27.624 --> 55:31.461
I think with all this bunny
we're going to miss the cup draw.

55:34.505 --> 55:35.881
About Wynton.

55:39.260 --> 55:43.180
He's deep into something, but there's
nothing that pins the rucks on him.

55:43.389 --> 55:45.558
- He's always on the scene.
- So are we.

55:48.101 --> 55:50.895
What? What did I say?

55:52.772 --> 55:55.483
Pompey vs. Arsenal. Should be tasty.

55:57.068 --> 55:58.653
We've got to got more specific.

55:58.862 --> 56:02.323
We're up to our tits in circumstantial, But
there's nothing to put our targets away.

56:02.531 --> 56:06.827
"Targets", bollocks! These
people are our mates.

56:09.204 --> 56:12.457
Of course they are our mates.

56:12.707 --> 56:14.542
I'm having the time of my life.

56:14.751 --> 56:18.254
I don't believe I'm hearing this!

56:20.673 --> 56:23.384
For fuck's sake, we're cops!

56:23.592 --> 56:25.761
RADIO: ...Shadwell Town.

56:25.969 --> 56:31.224
- Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes!

57:29.695 --> 57:31.822
Come on, you Dogs!

57:34.241 --> 57:37.034
You Wapping wankers!

57:39.537 --> 57:45.626
- Come on, Wapping. Where are you?
- Fucking shitting themselves.

58:10.399 --> 58:12.526
TREVOR: Stop, stop!

58:18.031 --> 58:21.200
You bloody hooligan!

58:23.703 --> 58:26.872
- EDDIE: In the chemist!
- JOHN: You're fucking joking!

58:35.631 --> 58:37.841
MARTIN: Shut up!

58:38.050 --> 58:39.550
Shut up, you!

58:40.176 --> 58:42.511
John, John! Billy!

58:43.471 --> 58:45.973
Nik! Pass!

59:01.696 --> 59:04.031
Can I help you, gentlemen?

59:04.240 --> 59:07.868
Perhaps your friends have gone away now?

59:13.123 --> 59:16.125
Here you are, mate. Sorry
to be of any trouble.

59:16.334 --> 59:18.836
- Sorry, mate.
- Sorry, mate.

59:19.045 --> 59:21.965
- Sorry, mate.
- The lid's over there, mate.

59:22.173 --> 59:23.675
Cheers, mate.

59:32.683 --> 59:34.518
Bottled it!

59:39.605 --> 59:43.359
ALL: Shadwell Army! Shadwell Army!

01:00:08.966 --> 01:00:12.595
What were you going to do
had they come in? Offer them a perm?

01:00:12.803 --> 01:00:15.556
Trev, look. Trevor.

01:00:15.764 --> 01:00:18.600
Look, Trevor.

01:00:22.395 --> 01:00:25.815
- MARTIN: What happened, Trev?
- I took on a busload of Wappers.

01:00:26.024 --> 01:00:29.401
- You never!
- That's right, you fucking never.

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:34.072
Alright? State of you
looks like the fun has already started.

01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:37.618
Boys and me are off to the home end
to kick some heads in. You on for it?

01:00:37.826 --> 01:00:40.786
- Just you lot?
- You're out of your bin.

01:00:40.995 --> 01:00:43.873
Last time we went down there,
one got his throat cut.

01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:46.792
- If you ain't got the bottle, fine by me.
- I'll come with you.

01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:51.005
- Anyone else?
- Trev. You've been fighting all morning.

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:55.008
Thank fuck some Dogs still have teeth.

01:01:28.039 --> 01:01:31.083
Us against this lot? We
must be fucking mad.

01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:33.710
You'll be alright, mate. Stand by me.

01:01:33.919 --> 01:01:36.129
This'll show some fucking Wappers.

01:01:44.971 --> 01:01:48.891
# We are Shadwell
The Kennel is our place

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:52.812
# Shadwell never, never, never
shall lose face.

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.648
# Though you hate us
we couldn't give a toss.

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.349
Let's go, son!

01:03:42.538 --> 01:03:46.207
Shadwell Army, Shadwell
Army, Shadwell Army!

01:04:02.222 --> 01:04:04.558
ALL: Yeah!

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.912
Where were you this afternoon?

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.831
I'm sorry, John, mate. I lost my bottle.

01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:05.877
It just went.

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.756
Couldn't control myself.

01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:13.717
I wouldn't have been any use, anyway.

01:06:15.302 --> 01:06:18.305
- Sorry.
- Alright.

01:06:22.852 --> 01:06:25.478
- Were you up our end?
- Bloody mess.

01:06:25.687 --> 01:06:28.314
I could've had 20 officers
for aggravated assault.

01:06:28.523 --> 01:06:31.484
- You putting it in your report?
- Yes, I fucking am.

01:06:31.693 --> 01:06:35.363
We've done ours. The full gory details.

01:06:36.154 --> 01:06:42.369
- You want to go to casualty.
- Nah, I'd rather have the scars.

01:06:42.578 --> 01:06:45.539
CHARLIE: I've got some good stuff from
the surveillance camera at Wapping.

01:06:45.747 --> 01:06:49.208
EDDIE: We reckon we've pinned
one of their top boys.

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:51.002
- Who is it?
- We don't know him.

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:56.215
We thought you might be able to
put a name to the face.

01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:02.888
EDDIE: Who is that runt, John?

01:07:03.513 --> 01:07:05.724
No one I know.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.290
"January 28. Wapping."

01:07:32.498 --> 01:07:35.752
Everything we've described,
we've seen with our own eyes, sir.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.836
You'd better have.

01:07:38.045 --> 01:07:41.673
We've had two undercover
London operations fall apart in court,

01:07:41.882 --> 01:07:46.720
and we've had to withdraw prosecutions
in Pentland due to unsafe evidence.

01:07:50.765 --> 01:07:53.684
DC Brandon, any problems with your work?

01:07:53.893 --> 01:07:55.645
Only those the Old Bill give us.

01:07:55.853 --> 01:07:58.231
- I don't quite...
- TREVOR: John's work has been brilliant.

01:07:58.439 --> 01:08:02.943
He dealt with the suspicions of the
targets by telling them he's illiterate.

01:08:04.861 --> 01:08:07.155
How did you got through training school?

01:08:09.199 --> 01:08:10.700
I don't quite follow.

01:08:10.909 --> 01:08:14.286
If you can't read or write,
how did you become a policeman?

01:08:14.954 --> 01:08:19.207
Sir, he can read and write.
It's part of his cover.

01:08:19.416 --> 01:08:23.837
- I made it up.
- I see.

01:08:24.046 --> 01:08:28.006
- I thought we had an illiterate policeman.
- JOHN: There's a thought...

01:08:28.216 --> 01:08:31.845
We were all wondering...
With all the court cases collapsing

01:08:32.053 --> 01:08:36.474
and other forces pulling
their covert squads out,

01:08:36.683 --> 01:08:39.768
are we to continue with our work, sir?

01:08:43.313 --> 01:08:46.149
- ALL: Yes!
- Autumn, lovely.

01:08:46.358 --> 01:08:47.943
Could be up with the cream then.

01:08:48.151 --> 01:08:50.279
Pan this one out,
and we can stay on another season.

01:08:50.487 --> 01:08:53.406
CHARLIE: Brighton away next bank
holiday. Well make a weekend of it.

01:08:53.613 --> 01:08:56.993
Can't fucking go, can I?
Marie's made other plans.

01:08:57.201 --> 01:09:00.746
Tell Mart and them. Tell
them the kid's sick.

01:09:14.593 --> 01:09:18.845
They wouldn't mind if you
asked for a transfer.

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:21.974
You've given them blood and sweat.

01:09:24.475 --> 01:09:27.520
You could go back into uniform,
they'd make you a sergeant.

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:30.106
Yes!

01:09:34.736 --> 01:09:38.113
I have not travelled all this way
to hear about Shadwell Town.

01:09:38.323 --> 01:09:40.365
Of course you ain't.

01:09:40.573 --> 01:09:42.910
You wouldn't cross the road for me.

01:09:43.118 --> 01:09:46.747
What's all this football
got to do with you?

01:09:47.956 --> 01:09:49.291
John.

01:09:51.376 --> 01:09:54.378
- My John.
- Your John?

01:09:55.463 --> 01:09:58.508
I ain't your fucking John.

01:09:59.467 --> 01:10:01.594
You don't know me at all.

01:10:01.802 --> 01:10:08.183
Mend the fuses, fix the car,
Mow the lawn, it's fucking boring.

01:10:08.391 --> 01:10:13.230
Do you think that's me? It's all bollocks.

01:10:13.438 --> 01:10:17.942
Fucking house, fucking babies. Shit.

01:10:21.237 --> 01:10:25.366
- Is that what you really think?
- I'm my John. Me.

01:10:25.574 --> 01:10:29.661
- I'm different.
- You don't look different to me, John.

01:10:29.869 --> 01:10:32.330
I see it every Saturday night.

01:10:32.539 --> 01:10:35.458
Millions of you. Men on the march,
beating each other up.

01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:39.712
Show us your tits or a fist in your face.
Is that you?

01:10:40.463 --> 01:10:44.591
If there was a war on,
they'd put you in the Army.

01:10:45.843 --> 01:10:49.137
There isn't a war, though, John.

01:10:50.097 --> 01:10:52.516
What's the matter with you?

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.811
When was the last time
you looked at my bum?

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:59.063
What?

01:10:59.272 --> 01:11:02.108
You don't like me any more do you?

01:11:02.316 --> 01:11:05.902
My body... It's what you want.

01:11:07.279 --> 01:11:11.575
You don't know my body.
You don't know my mind.

01:11:11.783 --> 01:11:14.369
You don't know me.

01:11:14.578 --> 01:11:18.497
Every fucking night I sleep with you,
and you know nothing.

01:11:19.248 --> 01:11:23.335
Look at me. Six weeks
since I've had that done,

01:11:23.544 --> 01:11:26.213
and you ain't fucking noticed.

01:11:26.422 --> 01:11:29.675
- Where are you going?
- For a fucking drink.

01:11:29.883 --> 01:11:33.136
If you don't stop right now, we're through.

01:11:33.344 --> 01:11:35.180
I mean it!

01:11:36.514 --> 01:11:41.269
When's the last time
you looked at my bum, John?

01:11:59.327 --> 01:12:02.538
LYNDA: We're open again
in six hours. Go home!

01:12:06.541 --> 01:12:08.960
- Where did you crawl out from?
- Lynda.

01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:12.923
- Have you seen yourself?
- I'm lonely, Lynda.

01:12:44.451 --> 01:12:46.870
CROWD: Shadwell Army, Shadwell Army!

01:12:47.079 --> 01:12:50.332
Shadwell Army, Shadwell Army!

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:40.420
Come on!

01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:52.431
I don't don't give a fuck
what anyone says. This is living.

01:13:52.639 --> 01:13:55.767
I could be artexing a ceiling,
Martin could be fixing motors,

01:13:55.976 --> 01:13:59.228
- and Gumbo could be packing pickles!
- Gherkins.

01:13:59.437 --> 01:14:02.440
What are we doing instead?
We go to the football!

01:14:02.648 --> 01:14:06.694
Lovely jubbly! John, North-East's that way.

01:14:06.903 --> 01:14:09.821
No, you don't know, man. It's the next one.

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:14.201
- NIK: No, John, it's this way.
- No, it's that one back there.

01:14:14.409 --> 01:14:20.040
- You fucking turkey!
- Can't you read or something?

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:25.294
Gumbo, if you've farted again
I'll deck you, I swear.

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:28.088
- Never!
- You stink, you arse!

01:14:49.483 --> 01:14:52.152
What are you fucking grinning at?

01:15:12.295 --> 01:15:14.923
There's no turning back now, lads.

01:15:31.605 --> 01:15:33.941
Fuck me, what is this?

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:04.135
Fucking wanking foreigners. Fucking nobs.

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.216
Come round this side,
we'll see how brave you are!

01:16:46.508 --> 01:16:48.383
Aargh!

01:16:55.432 --> 01:16:57.851
Bastards!

01:17:17.327 --> 01:17:20.372
Right, that's it!

01:17:27.128 --> 01:17:30.673
What are you doing to stop this?
My mate's nearly had his eye taken out.

01:17:30.881 --> 01:17:34.009
Just shut it. Get back
in the cage with the other animals.

01:17:34.218 --> 01:17:37.054
They're throwing fucking darts, you twat!

01:17:37.262 --> 01:17:40.223
I couldn't give a monkey's fart.
Now fuck off!

01:17:40.431 --> 01:17:44.561
What's your divisional number and
to what station are you attached?

01:17:44.769 --> 01:17:49.232
If you don't fuck off in five seconds,
I'm nicking you.

01:17:49.439 --> 01:17:51.150
- You...
- Come on, leave it!

01:17:51.358 --> 01:17:54.862
- I'll fucking kill him!
- It's not worth it, he's one of us.

01:17:55.070 --> 01:18:01.076
- Belt him and your job's down the pan.
- I don't care. They can shove their job.

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:07.748
- Are you alright, mate?
- Yeah, it was only my head.

01:18:07.957 --> 01:18:10.877
- Not worth it, is it, football?
- It's worth it to me.

01:18:11.085 --> 01:18:14.921
Shadwell's my life.
Without them I'm nothing, mate.

01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:18.383
- Fuck off, you thick runt.
- I'm sorry, John.

01:18:32.688 --> 01:18:35.983
FAN: Come on, you wankers!
I'll have the lot ofyou!

01:20:41.973 --> 01:20:43.975
There's fucking loads of them, Martin.

01:20:47.061 --> 01:20:48.938
Come on, Shadwell! Stand and fight!

01:20:49.147 --> 01:20:53.026
I ain't going fucking nowhere John.

01:20:54.067 --> 01:20:55.861
Well?

01:20:57.946 --> 01:20:59.865
Shadwell!

01:21:13.127 --> 01:21:14.712
John, John!

01:21:14.921 --> 01:21:17.881
I'm cut. Somebody stabbed me. I'm bleeding!

01:21:18.089 --> 01:21:20.133
Come on, we've got to disappear!

01:21:27.057 --> 01:21:30.518
Where am I cut? I can't see anything.

01:21:30.726 --> 01:21:35.397
- I can't see a thing.
- I'm alright, I'm not hurt.

01:21:35.606 --> 01:21:39.485
- Not a scratch on you.
- Fucking Geordies, I piss on them.

01:21:44.572 --> 01:21:48.368
- JOHN: Fucking yes!
- MARTIN: Yes!

01:21:48.576 --> 01:21:52.622
- MARTIN: Shadwell!
- JOHN: Wankers!

01:22:03.048 --> 01:22:06.218
- Fucking hell, John! No!
- It's alright, Lynda.

01:22:06.426 --> 01:22:09.095
It's someone else's blood.

01:22:11.848 --> 01:22:15.935
Look at you.
Covered in bruises, like a bad spud.

01:22:16.144 --> 01:22:19.563
When Mart pulled me out and I saw
the blood, I thought I was a goner.

01:22:19.771 --> 01:22:23.483
I thought: "Fuck me, what a wanky waste!"

01:22:23.692 --> 01:22:28.155
We ain't got time. I want a life,
I want kids. Make something.

01:22:29.823 --> 01:22:33.909
- Turns out I wasn't even scratched.
- Well, some poor sod was.

01:22:34.118 --> 01:22:36.620
Yeah. Goes with the territory, doesn't it?

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:43.751
You said you've got a kid, John. John...

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:07.524
Alright, what?

01:23:08.691 --> 01:23:10.109
What?!

01:23:12.195 --> 01:23:14.864
Don't shout at us.

01:23:15.072 --> 01:23:18.951
I walk in, and it's like
I've got some fucking disease.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.454
What, am I a Gooner, some leper?

01:23:23.455 --> 01:23:26.249
What the fuck is it? What's wrong with me?

01:23:26.458 --> 01:23:28.710
We have been wondering...

01:23:32.421 --> 01:23:34.215
Trevor?

01:23:38.844 --> 01:23:40.846
You've gone too far.

01:23:43.307 --> 01:23:44.641
What?

01:23:44.849 --> 01:23:48.436
Saturday. You know what I'm saying,
you overstepped the mark.

01:23:48.645 --> 01:23:51.481
You know where the fucking mark is, do you?

01:23:51.689 --> 01:23:53.525
Yeah, I do.

01:23:53.733 --> 01:23:56.027
Show me. Here, fucking show me.

01:23:56.236 --> 01:23:59.029
- Leave it, John.
- You, shut it!

01:24:01.532 --> 01:24:05.869
Give me my marker.
Let me know where I stop.

01:24:06.078 --> 01:24:08.622
Is this the place?

01:24:11.165 --> 01:24:13.376
Or here?

01:24:16.712 --> 01:24:21.217
Surely, this is it. The edge isn't it?
Surely.

01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:31.518
Tell me when I've touched the bone.

01:24:31.726 --> 01:24:34.895
There were video cameras
at Tyneburn Market.

01:24:39.275 --> 01:24:44.738
- Who's seen them?
- Trev drove up on Sunday night.

01:24:44.947 --> 01:24:49.033
Flashed a false warrant,
greased a few palms.

01:24:49.242 --> 01:24:51.035
Who's seen them?

01:24:53.913 --> 01:24:56.458
Some little runt.
Didn't know what he was looking at.

01:24:56.666 --> 01:24:59.209
- And us.
- Give.

01:24:59.418 --> 01:25:02.087
- Trashed it.
- No.

01:25:02.296 --> 01:25:04.506
You wouldn't without me seeing it first.

01:25:04.715 --> 01:25:07.718
You can live without it.

01:25:08.552 --> 01:25:12.513
I can't remember anything. I swear.

01:25:19.479 --> 01:25:22.190
I'm still a fucking human being.

01:25:35.409 --> 01:25:37.495
Thanks, Trev.

01:25:37.703 --> 01:25:42.583
That's alright, John. You've helped me
out of a few scrapes.

01:25:43.876 --> 01:25:47.587
Can't you look at me?

01:26:00.432 --> 01:26:02.851
Alright, John, how are you doing?

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:06.480
- John.
- Hey, Mart.

01:26:06.688 --> 01:26:08.440
Alright, Trev?

01:26:08.649 --> 01:26:13.361
Listen, mate. Word's gone round.
We're top fucking boys, mate.

01:26:13.569 --> 01:26:17.698
Oi, Wynton wants a word with you.

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:44.348
Just a few sweeties. Don't mean shit.

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:49.144
Anything you ever want,
I'm the man you ask.

01:27:14.834 --> 01:27:19.297
This football lark,
the wallop has dropped out of it.

01:27:19.505 --> 01:27:21.716
It's never been my scene, really.

01:27:22.467 --> 01:27:26.261
England likes a bit of anarchy,
give it a good kick up the arse.

01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:29.222
And no one's having any fun any more.

01:27:29.431 --> 01:27:32.809
It's all over, all over.

01:27:34.227 --> 01:27:38.355
The bootboys'll go back to lurking in
the shit and slime with the BNP.

01:27:38.564 --> 01:27:44.320
Everyone else will get fat and bald,
bring their kiddies to the match.

01:27:44.528 --> 01:27:47.615
You, though. There's a career for you.

01:27:47.823 --> 01:27:49.616
I've got a career.

01:27:51.201 --> 01:27:54.079
I don't mean pay the mortgage and die.

01:27:55.121 --> 01:27:57.874
Some place where you can use your talents.

01:27:59.334 --> 01:28:01.377
You've got something to offer.

01:28:01.586 --> 01:28:04.338
I've been watching you a while.

01:28:05.339 --> 01:28:09.635
You really want to be a had boy, don't you?

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:16.349
People I know have been
hearing your name, asking about you.

01:28:18.684 --> 01:28:21.187
What do you say we go and meet my friends?

01:28:21.395 --> 01:28:23.981
I don't see why not.

01:28:53.299 --> 01:28:55.468
TREVOR: No!

01:28:55.677 --> 01:29:00.974
So some other crew's fucked up.
Why have we got to carry the can?

01:29:01.182 --> 01:29:03.350
Yes, I bloody am!

01:29:05.727 --> 01:29:07.896
What's that got to do with us?

01:29:09.481 --> 01:29:11.942
What do you expect?

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.570
The Wapping squad's been
blown out of court.

01:29:15.778 --> 01:29:17.655
The Yard want to look at our evidence.

01:29:17.864 --> 01:29:19.282
They can't!

01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:23.494
I just spent a night in a room with
five of the country's most wanted!

01:29:23.703 --> 01:29:26.998
Same as the last Shadwell squad.
They made the whole thing up.

01:29:27.206 --> 01:29:29.291
The football's nothing. Don't you see?

01:29:29.499 --> 01:29:31.376
Same as Southsea, Mid City...

01:29:31.585 --> 01:29:34.254
I'm getting Armalites in one ear
and crack in the other.

01:29:34.463 --> 01:29:35.881
Fucking wankers.

01:29:36.089 --> 01:29:40.134
We've been blind. Rucks are just
a sideshow. There's no conspiracy.

01:29:40.342 --> 01:29:43.429
They're handing everything over
to the Police Complaints Authority.

01:29:43.637 --> 01:29:46.599
- That's fucking private!
- If it's in here, they own it.

01:29:46.807 --> 01:29:50.770
- Can't help you, John.
- This ain't the Rock crowd, it's villains!

01:29:50.978 --> 01:29:54.564
The criminals
the taxpayers are paying us to catch!

01:29:54.773 --> 01:29:58.318
Speaking of the taxpayers, you've got
to hand in your expenses today.

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:00.987
Then everything's null and void.

01:30:01.196 --> 01:30:02.697
Be fucking careful!

01:30:02.906 --> 01:30:05.699
What's wrong with this?
We'll soon be back in business.

01:30:05.908 --> 01:30:08.243
- Everything we've written is kosher!
- TREVOR: Yeah.

01:30:08.452 --> 01:30:10.871
And half of what we've written
is against the Bill.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.082
It'll go down a treat
in the current climate.

01:30:14.124 --> 01:30:16.001
Have you got your expenses?

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:20.505
The Police Complaints Authority have
sifted your evidence with a toothcomb,

01:30:20.713 --> 01:30:25.218
and don't have a single serious query
about your work.

01:30:25.426 --> 01:30:27.929
You are all to be commended.

01:30:28.137 --> 01:30:32.391
Whether the work achieves
its original goals is another question.

01:30:32.599 --> 01:30:36.686
A question which
some have raised rather loudly.

01:30:36.895 --> 01:30:39.398
The operation is being
terminated forthwith.

01:30:39.606 --> 01:30:42.274
No arrests or charges will be made.

01:30:42.483 --> 01:30:47.571
I've got tickets for the Oldham game.
If we win, we'll get promoted.

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:50.991
You are never to set foot
in Shadwell Town Football Club again.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:54.494
You are not to frequent the pubs
you've been using,

01:30:54.702 --> 01:30:59.124
and you will not make contact
with your targets for any purpose.

01:31:00.458 --> 01:31:03.586
You will receive two weeks' paid leave.

01:31:03.795 --> 01:31:08.298
When you report back for duty, you
Will each do a stint of community beat

01:31:08.507 --> 01:31:10.300
in your respective divisions.

01:31:10.509 --> 01:31:13.095
But, sir. Mine and John's
division is Shadwell.

01:31:13.303 --> 01:31:18.057
If any of our targets see us in uniform,
we're fucking dead. Sir.

01:31:18.266 --> 01:31:21.978
I know. This is a terrible shock for you,

01:31:22.186 --> 01:31:25.022
but I expect you to behave like policemen.

01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:28.943
If we did that, we'd be booting in
Your fucking head by now.

01:31:29.152 --> 01:31:34.114
Bollocks! Fucking arsehole!
What are you looking at?

01:31:35.282 --> 01:31:37.784
- How are you doing, Charlie?
- Have you got a month?

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:39.995
Your evidence went down a
treat with our fellas.

01:31:40.203 --> 01:31:43.372
What's the Licensing Department
doing with our evidence?

01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:45.624
We've been after The Rock for years.

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:50.588
Late hours, illegal gaming,
dangerous weapons, drugs,..

01:31:50.796 --> 01:31:52.840
Lovely work, lads.

01:31:56.968 --> 01:31:59.054
No more Rock!

01:32:03.725 --> 01:32:06.144
JOHN: No more Bob.

01:32:08.854 --> 01:32:12.399
No more Nik and Martin.

01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:18.072
No more Gumbo.

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.449
Fucking love you, Gumbo.

01:32:24.619 --> 01:32:27.413
No more Shadwell.

01:32:27.622 --> 01:32:30.875
That's it, mate. Gone.

01:32:32.834 --> 01:32:38.215
CHARLIE: It might be gone,
but at least we had it.

01:32:40.008 --> 01:32:42.219
The Dogs,

01:32:43.011 --> 01:32:45.221
- EDDIE: The Dogs,
- TREVOR: The Dogs,

01:32:55.688 --> 01:32:59.818
Come on, John. Help us see the office off.

01:33:02.612 --> 01:33:08.075
That tape of me at Tyneburn. What happened?

01:33:09.451 --> 01:33:15.499
John, this is history.
You've got to let it go.

01:33:19.169 --> 01:33:21.921
I was a top boy, Charlie.

01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:25.508
I am fucking sick of this.

01:33:27.385 --> 01:33:31.013
John, you're not a top boy.

01:33:33.098 --> 01:33:37.060
You're fucking Bill, that's all.
You're nothing.

01:33:39.479 --> 01:33:44.234
Don't look at me like that.
I know that look.

01:33:44.443 --> 01:33:47.611
It's how you look
when you're about to deck some runt.

01:33:49.572 --> 01:33:51.574
- Come on, then.
- Don't be silly, Trev.

01:33:51.782 --> 01:33:57.495
No. Fucking come on.
I've had enough of this sulky runt.

01:33:58.747 --> 01:34:02.625
Do you want to slap me? So, fucking hit me.

01:34:04.127 --> 01:34:07.630
There. Go on.

01:34:07.839 --> 01:34:10.340
Just there.

01:34:10.549 --> 01:34:12.509
Learn something, did you?

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.519
CHARLIE: Come on, you tosser!

01:34:23.728 --> 01:34:26.773
JOHN: I don't know none of you.

01:34:49.835 --> 01:34:52.296
Darling, it's so good to see you.

01:34:53.339 --> 01:34:57.676
You fucker! Bastard! You fucking bastard!

01:34:57.885 --> 01:35:02.389
You fucker! You bastard!

01:35:03.139 --> 01:35:04.891
What have I done?

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:09.062
You know what you've done!
You closed down The Rock!

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:12.815
- I don't got it!
- You fucking arsehole plod.

01:35:13.023 --> 01:35:15.401
I should turn you over to Bob.

01:35:29.997 --> 01:35:32.917
I didn't know you smoked.

01:35:34.918 --> 01:35:39.715
- How long have you known?
- You fig tosser!

01:35:39.923 --> 01:35:43.510
I clocked you the first time
you walked through the door.

01:35:43.719 --> 01:35:45.929
Does Bob know?

01:35:46.138 --> 01:35:48.639
He can't see further than
the end of his nose.

01:35:48.848 --> 01:35:51.642
It's me that gives him the nod
when you lot are around.

01:35:51.851 --> 01:35:54.311
I nearly did when Trevor was mauling me.

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:57.064
Bob would have killed him.

01:36:00.608 --> 01:36:03.528
What now? With us?

01:36:04.946 --> 01:36:08.199
You're joking. Look at the state of you.
You're not much of a catch.

01:36:10.952 --> 01:36:16.165
I got off on the danger.
Can't you see that?

01:36:18.625 --> 01:36:21.336
Crystal.

01:36:21.545 --> 01:36:25.339
Now do me a favour and
fuck off out of my life.

01:36:25.548 --> 01:36:27.717
Don't slam the door after.

01:36:55.951 --> 01:36:58.537
- You've got to be joking!
- Is she in?

01:36:58.746 --> 01:37:01.706
- Go before you got hurt.
- I just want to talk to her!

01:37:01.915 --> 01:37:03.666
- I'm counting to three.
- MARIE: Dad?

01:37:03.875 --> 01:37:05.960
It's alright, darling. Leave it to us.

01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:07.712
JOHN: Marie! Marie!

01:37:07.921 --> 01:37:09.714
You've been warned. I'm getting the dogs.

01:37:09.923 --> 01:37:13.384
- I just want to talk to you!
- John, you're making it worse.

01:37:13.592 --> 01:37:17.096
You transferred without telling me.
What am I supposed to do?

01:37:17.304 --> 01:37:20.182
Please don't do this to me, John.

01:37:24.144 --> 01:37:26.479
JOHN: Fuck off, then!

01:37:26.688 --> 01:37:30.858
See if I give a fuck.
Your fucking house... Fuck it!

01:37:31.067 --> 01:37:37.572
You know what you are, don't you?
The worst fucking fuck I ever had.

01:37:37.781 --> 01:37:41.952
Find some posh fuck who can't got it up!

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.039
Marry him and have dopey fucking kids!

01:37:46.248 --> 01:37:52.962
Here's a promise. When I have kids,
I'll teach them to hate you.

01:37:53.170 --> 01:37:56.006
All of you!

01:37:56.215 --> 01:38:02.512
My kids will fucking come round here
and eat yours!

01:38:06.933 --> 01:38:09.519
I do love you, though.

01:38:11.021 --> 01:38:13.023
Honest.

01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:19.902
RADIO: Shadwell Town are promoted
to the First Division for the first time.

01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:24.198
The players are engulfed in
emotional scenes that six weeks ago

01:41:24.406 --> 01:41:25.824
hardly seemed possible.

01:41:26.033 --> 01:41:30.286
Everyone at the club is stunned by
that fatal stabbing at Tyneburn,

01:41:30.495 --> 01:41:34.916
but that's all forgotten now on
a historic day for the East London club.

01:41:35.124 --> 01:41:39.045
The goal that made it all possible came
15 minutes into a tense second half.

01:41:39.253 --> 01:41:41.839
Inevitably, it was Gerry Edwards
who did the damage,

01:41:42.048 --> 01:41:44.633
bundling home after good work
on the left by Walton.

01:41:44.841 --> 01:41:46.176
Not a great game...

01:41:48.011 --> 01:41:51.473
The boy's a bit backward. He's
pleading not guilty against my advice.

01:41:51.682 --> 01:41:54.142
Perhaps a little token interrogation
Will change his mind.

01:41:54.351 --> 01:41:56.519
I don't know anything about this case.

01:41:56.727 --> 01:42:00.147
- I've been sent here as a cover.
- I know. CID thinks it's below them.

01:42:00.356 --> 01:42:04.777
Oh, terrific! I'm cleaning
the toilets out next.

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:07.737
I'm supposed to be a sergeant.

01:42:07.946 --> 01:42:11.449
Five minutes, I'll see what I can do.
What's he done, anyhow?

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:15.662
He's stolen a jar of pickles
from the factory where he works.

01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:23.002
Oh, fuck me! No!

01:42:23.210 --> 01:42:25.796
Trev, what are you doing here?

01:42:30.759 --> 01:42:33.553
Hello, Gumbo. How are you doing?

01:42:33.761 --> 01:42:36.514
Trev, I don't get it. What's going on?

01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:43.520
- I'm a policeman, Gumbo.
- No, you fucking hate Old Bill.

01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:47.774
- Gumbo, I am Old Bill.
- Fuck me, no!

01:42:52.279 --> 01:42:55.407
You wait 'til John hears about this.
He'll go fucking spare.

01:43:00.661 --> 01:43:04.457
THUGS: White, white, white is right
kick 'em out and fight, fight, fight

01:43:04.665 --> 01:43:08.710
White, white, white is right
kick 'em out and fight, fight, fight

01:43:08.918 --> 01:43:12.464
White, white, white is right
kick 'em out and fight, fight, fight

01:43:12.672 --> 01:43:16.718
White, white, white is right
kick 'em out and fight, fight, fight

01:43:16.926 --> 01:43:20.971
White, white, white is right
kick 'em out and fight, fight, fight

01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:25.642
White, white, white is right
kick 'em out and fight, fight, fight

01:43:34.859 --> 01:43:36.944
John, you arsehole!

01:43:37.862 --> 01:43:40.281
What the fuck are you doing, John?!

01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:45.744
You twat! You never learn. I'm on the job.

01:43:45.952 --> 01:43:49.414
Now fuck off before you got me killed!

01:44:04.679 --> 01:44:08.349
Sieg heil, sieg heil, sieg heil...

01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:13.311
Sieg heil, sieg heil, sieg heil,

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.064
sieg heil, sieg heil, sieg heil,

01:44:16.272 --> 01:44:19.109
sieg heil, sieg heil, sieg heil...
