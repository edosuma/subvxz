00:10.427 --> 00:11.636
Big announcement.

00:11.636 --> 00:14.472
I've decided to make
a major change
in the camp's menu.

00:14.472 --> 00:17.517
If it's from inedible
to edible, I'm down.

00:19.102 --> 00:22.731
From now on,
we will all be
enjoying meat-free meals.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.149
BOTH: Ew!

00:25.984 --> 00:28.361
What choice do I have, people?
The average blood pressure
at this camp

00:28.361 --> 00:31.364
is higher than the most
from bacon and butter
chugging society.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.035
Their motto is
if you fry it,
we'll try it.

00:36.953 --> 00:37.829
So, what do you
have in mind?

00:39.789 --> 00:43.334
I have purchased a low-salt,
low-fat, high protein product
called 'Almost Meat'.

00:45.503 --> 00:48.298
It says here it's delicious
right out of the box.
Try some.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.805
I'd rather
eat the box!

00:57.807 --> 01:00.769
This tastes like you
took rotten cheese,
dipped it in toe jam,

01:00.769 --> 01:02.353
then baked it
in a dirty diaper.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.483
That is odd.
It's supposed
to be teriyaki.

Thanks again for loaning me
your metal detector to find
my missing ring.

01:32.008 --> 01:36.012
Don't thank me yet. So far,
all we've found is a bottle
cap and two pennies.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.931
Don't forget
the slightly
used retainer.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.768
Huh. I guess the owner
was chewing gum
when he lost it.

01:42.852 --> 01:43.853
Ooh, spearmint!

01:45.188 --> 01:46.731
We're never gonna
find your ring.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.191
Come on,
let's go.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.153
But I had to eat
four boxes of cereal
to find that plastic ring!

01:52.654 --> 01:55.323
There is one in every box,
but somehow I kept
swallowing them.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.076
It's a plastic ring?

01:58.576 --> 02:01.371
Why would you think
a metal detector
would find plastic?

02:01.913 --> 02:05.041
Sorry. I get it.
I'm not as smart
as you.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.918
We can't all get
straight E's in school.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.130

give those?

Or cavity-free check ups.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.598
Hey, what's that
on the dirt?

02:21.516 --> 02:23.434
Are those bones?

02:24.102 --> 02:26.020
There might be more.
Help me dig.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.023
You want me to dig up
bones with my bare hands?

02:29.023 --> 02:30.942
I'd rather wear
that filthy retainer.

I'm telling you, this
looks like some kind
of animal skeleton.

No way.

Name one creature
that has the face
of a duck,

02:46.749 --> 02:49.544
the body of a cow,
and the thighs
of a pig.

surgery?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.759
Okay. Name
two creatures.

02:57.886 --> 03:01.014
I think this might
be the skeleton
of some brand-new species!

03:01.389 --> 03:06.102
That's crazy. This is
what happens when you
eat old retainer gum.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.067
Hey guys.
What are you
working on?

03:13.067 --> 03:15.403
Our cabin scrapbook
got torched in the fire
last year, .

03:16.029 --> 03:17.822
so Emma reprinted
the pictures.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.991
I also did some
retouching to erase
bad hair days.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.953
You put a hat
on me in
every picture.

our fish fry.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.924
See, Lou?
I put you
in a chef's hat.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.011
That day was a real
canoe tipper,
am I right?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.806
What does
canoe tipper
mean?

03:43.806 --> 03:46.184
Oh, it's a long story.

there was
a salute.

Oh, sorry.
We were going
to teach it to you,

04:01.491 --> 04:03.284
but then we got hit
with that rodent
infestation.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.328
It's hard to get back
into the normal routine

04:05.328 --> 04:06.871
once you find
a possum
in your toilet.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.918

to show you
something.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.753
It's about that
new species
in the woods.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.089
We didn't discover
a new species.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.841
You're right.
I discovered it.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.135
You were just out there,
bathing in hand sanitizer.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.096

Hey, where
did you get
Ravi's tablet?

04:26.599 --> 04:27.892
In the owner's office.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.144
But isn't
the office
always locked?

04:30.520 --> 04:31.604
What are you,
a cop?

04:33.147 --> 04:35.733
So, I uploaded
a picture of the bones
we found,

04:36.109 --> 04:38.528
and created an image
of what the skeleton
would look like.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.949
Then I add the fur,
and hooves,
and voila!

04:43.366 --> 04:44.367
MATTEO: Wow.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.036
I can't believe
you did all this.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.330
You don't have
to sound
so surprised.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.165
I can be
pretty smart
sometimes.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.960
If I wasn't,
could I make it
do this?

and make it
do the na-na.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.430
I'll prove that
this creature
exists.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.348

into the woods,

05:07.348 --> 05:08.933
and find the rest
of that skeleton.

Look, I love that
you're excited
about science,

05:12.478 --> 05:14.480
but I just don't think
you're right about this.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.026
I bet if Ravi
told you he
found a new species,

05:18.026 --> 05:19.235
you'd believe him.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.195
Yes. Because
he's good at science.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.614
And he never tried
to convince me

05:23.614 --> 05:25.450
that a ghost
broke my microscope.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.618
That negative
attitude is why

05:27.618 --> 05:30.121
the ghost broke
your microscope
in the first place.

were food,

to know

like coming back up.

I cannot, please
do not kill me.

Woodchuck world?

06:25.301 --> 06:26.928
Is that a theme park
I don't know about?

06:26.928 --> 06:30.098
Because if so,
I'm going there
on the honeymoon.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.476
No, I'm talking
about this book

the camp
library.

The Great Book
of Woodchuck.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.399
Oh, that?
It was written
a long time ago.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.984
It's a little
outdated.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.402
No kidding.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.905
It says tuition
can be paid in
wooden nickels or goats.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.368
It also says
that every
new woodchuck

06:50.368 --> 06:51.911
has to be initiated
by midnight

06:51.911 --> 06:53.162
on the first
full moon
of summer.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.082
I looked it up,
and that's tonight!

06:56.457 --> 06:57.708
Oh, no, it's
not a big deal.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.169
We didn't do
the initiation,
and we're Woodchucks.

07:00.461 --> 07:04.340
Unless you consider
poison ivy on my butt
as an initiation.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.594
But, I won't feel
like a real Woodchuck
until I do this.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.097
Well, it would
make her happy.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.267
Which is why
I guess kids
go to camp.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.439
Okay, Destiny,
looks like
you're getting

07:19.439 --> 07:21.774
a good old-fashioned
Woodchuck initiation.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.318
Minus the
moose tipping.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.195
Looks like they
had to stop
doing that.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.698
The moose started
tipping back.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.413
Okay, if we are
going to prove
your theory,

07:35.413 --> 07:38.583
we need to search
the site for more
specimens to analyze.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.377
Great! While you do that,
I'm gonna start digging
some dirt

07:41.377 --> 07:42.920

need to be
methodical.

contaminating the site
with your boogers.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.400
Okay. Maybe
a tad less honest.

We discovered
a new species
in the woods.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.448

better from you.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.574
What about me?

08:53.574 --> 08:55.284
Well, for you,
this is about right.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.790
Okay, Destiny,
time to begin

09:00.790 --> 09:02.583
the Woodchuck
Initiation ritual.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.460
Once you've completed
these requirements,

09:04.460 --> 09:06.546
you will be
an official,
bonafide Woodchuck.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.798
With no reason
whatsoever
to feel left out

09:08.798 --> 09:10.174
or write
a complaint letter
to your dad.

09:11.592 --> 09:12.635
Sorry, I'm late.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.220
Where have you been?

09:14.220 --> 09:17.265
Uh, there was a backup
on the hiking trail.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.016
Overturned turtle.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.311
(SUSPICIOUSLY)
Okay!

09:23.604 --> 09:25.815
Now that we're
at full chuck,
you must answer

09:25.815 --> 09:27.984
a question from
The Great Book.
Are you ready?

09:28.526 --> 09:30.778
Yep! I am
the queen
of Q and A.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.113
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:33.406 --> 09:36.492
How much wood
would a woodchuck
chuck

09:37.076 --> 09:39.453
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?

09:43.082 --> 09:46.294
None. Woodchucks
can't chuck wood.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.170
(GASPS) Lou,
set her straight.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.009
It's true.
Although delightful
and cute,

09:53.009 --> 09:55.344
woodchucks are useless
at chucking wood.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.557
So our cabin name
is based on a lie?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.978
Look, it's a part
of our cabin's history
we're not proud of,

10:03.978 --> 10:05.855
so let's just give
Destiny credit
and move on.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.196
Okay, when the creature
triggers the motion sensor,

10:14.196 --> 10:16.073
an alarm will
notify us in
the cabin.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.993
Then hopefully,
it will get trapped
in our cage.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.580
I could protect us,
or listen to your
yakkity-yak.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.664
I can't do both.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.502
Thanks again for standing
guard with a bow and...
foam arrow?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.506
Yeah. Ever since
the archery incident,

10:32.506 --> 10:34.050
They won't give me
the pointy ones.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.594
They said, "Target."
I thought they said
"Margaret."

10:36.594 --> 10:37.678
It was all
very confusing.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.222
You need help.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.059
That's exactly what
Margaret said.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.811
Followed closely by,
"Call an ambulance!"

10:49.690 --> 10:51.609
How much longer
is it gonna
take Destiny

10:51.609 --> 10:53.069
to finish
the task?

10:53.444 --> 10:54.654
I wish I had put
a time limit on it.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.948
I agree. I'm tired,
and I haven't had
a decent meal

10:57.948 --> 11:00.368
since Ravi started
his meat moratorium.

11:00.618 --> 11:04.872
I just want to hit the sack
and dream of a double cheese
burger, with bacon,

11:05.414 --> 11:06.540
stuffed into
a turkey.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.919
I did it!
I got that
snake skin.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.587
What happened
to you?

11:11.587 --> 11:14.006
Well, the snake
wasn't happy
about giving it up.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.510
You were supposed to get
some skin that the snake
already shed.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.012
Well, it would have
been nice if you had
mentioned that before.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.972
For me,
and the snake.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.142
Whatever.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.313
Destiny, you are now
ready for your final
initiation task.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.818
This is the most
significant challenging
portion of the ta...

11:33.818 --> 11:34.902
Just get to the task!

11:35.194 --> 11:36.946
I have to complete
this by midnight!

11:37.696 --> 11:38.697
Okay.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.492
Too bad being snippy
isn't one of the tasks.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.080
To be a true
woodchuck,

11:46.080 --> 11:48.374
you must help
a woodchuck
in need.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.667
Okay, Sass?

11:51.335 --> 11:54.088
Help a woodchuck
in need? What does
that even mean?

11:54.588 --> 11:57.091
I don't know,
but what do
you guys need?

11:57.383 --> 11:59.969
For no other campers
to ever find that book.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.348
Wait a minute.
(SNIFFS) Do you guys
smell Chinese food?

12:04.348 --> 12:05.349
No.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.437
Lou, I know
we're all hungry,

12:09.437 --> 12:10.896
but I'm running
out of time.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.691
Why would there be
Chinese food in
the middle of the woods?

12:13.941 --> 12:15.401
That makes no sense.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.612
I think we should
just call it this done
and head home.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.656
No way. I've gotta
go meet that meat.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.327
No! I only have
10 minutes left.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.539
I'm telling you guys
there's nothing
to smell here!

12:29.123 --> 12:30.916
Your noses are
hallucinating!

12:32.918 --> 12:34.587
(ALARM BUZZING)
(GASPS)

12:35.087 --> 12:37.131
The beast triggered
the motion alarm!

12:37.631 --> 12:39.884
What beast?
What alarm?
What is happening?

12:39.884 --> 12:42.928
It must be near
the trap. Let's go!
No, sir!

12:42.928 --> 12:46.557
I will not let my campers
go into the dark woods
unsupervised!

12:46.807 --> 12:50.227
There's no exception
to this rule, and I'm
unwavering on this point.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.271
We understand.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.565
See ya!

12:56.775 --> 12:59.278
Why do they
never listen to me?
I hear myself talking.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.200
(SNIFFING)
I think we're close.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.911
My wonton sensor
is spiking.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.415
Can we please
get back to my
Woodchuck initiation?

13:11.415 --> 13:12.541
It's almost midnight!

13:14.627 --> 13:16.754
Oh! Ah-ha!
I knew it!

13:17.630 --> 13:19.632
Someone ordered Chinese
food in the middle
of the woods?

13:20.132 --> 13:21.342
That's crazy.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.721
Why would anyone leave
an order of soup, spare ribs
and Peking Duck

13:25.721 --> 13:26.722
in the middle
of the woods?

13:27.681 --> 13:28.766
Wait a minute.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.935
How did you know
exactly what's
in this bag?

13:31.602 --> 13:33.395
Uh, lucky guess?

13:34.772 --> 13:36.941
Zuri, if you don't
explain where this
food came from,

13:36.941 --> 13:39.276
so help me, I will
drink all this soup
right now.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.694
Drop that egg drop.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.155
Okay, okay.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.991
I've been having
Chinese food
delivered because

13:45.991 --> 13:48.410
I can't stand
Ravi's 'Almost Meat'.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.372
It tastes like
a gym sock that
gave up on life.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.667
But you're the one
who's been defending
Ravi's food.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.335
And this whole time
you were sneaking off

13:56.335 --> 13:58.879
and eating juicy,
meaty Chinese food
all by yourself?

13:58.879 --> 14:00.047
Can you
blame me?

14:00.047 --> 14:02.258
No, but you
could have
at least shared.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.428
It's mine!
Back off,
you savages!

14:06.428 --> 14:08.389
Zuri, give me a rib,
or you'll be sorry.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.307
Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

14:10.307 --> 14:12.434
Because I'm about
to sink my teeth
into something,

14:12.434 --> 14:14.186
and I think
you'd rather
it be the rib.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.439
(TWIG BREAKS)
(ALL GASPING AND SCREAMING)

14:18.357 --> 14:19.608
(GASPING)
What just
happened?

14:20.192 --> 14:21.402
We're trapped!

14:21.402 --> 14:23.821
It's probably just
a bear trap.
I can lift it.

14:23.821 --> 14:24.864
Nobody panic.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.116
(GRUNTS)

14:27.366 --> 14:29.827
I can't lift it.
Everybody panic!

14:31.579 --> 14:34.874
What if this trap was set
by some psycho who's
coming to kill us?

14:34.874 --> 14:38.711
Then he'll have to pry
these ribs out of my
cold, dead hands.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.260
Whoever set this trap
could be back
any minute.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.678
Hey psycho!

14:47.928 --> 14:49.805
Don't bother
coming after
my egg rolls,

14:49.805 --> 14:51.640
because I already
licked them all!

14:53.893 --> 14:55.895
I can't believe
this stupid cage

14:55.895 --> 14:57.396
is going to
prevent me
from completing

14:57.396 --> 14:58.814
my Woodchuck
initiation.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.943
Destiny, we're trapped
like rats, and you're still
thinking about that ritual?

15:02.943 --> 15:05.404
Yeah, I always thought
that nobody took this
Woodchuck stuff

15:05.404 --> 15:06.947
more seriously
than I did, but,

15:07.197 --> 15:08.991
you're acting
a little
cray-cray.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.202
Destiny, why is this
so important to you?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.747
I think it was
the fish fry.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.249
The what?
The fish fry.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.878
You know, how you guys
said it was a canoe-tipper?

15:20.878 --> 15:22.254
And I had no idea
what that meant?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.673
You say stuff
like that
all the time.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.927
And when you mention
some memory I wasn't
there for,

15:28.218 --> 15:29.595
I feel like
I don't belong.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.222
Mmm.
We're sorry, Destiny.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.892
We never meant
to make you feel
that way.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.645
The last thing we ever wanted
was for you to feel left out.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.647
I just wanted
to be one of you.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.649
A real Woodchuck.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.817
But you are
a real Woodchuck.

15:44.485 --> 15:48.280
And we're creating
great new memories
together all the time.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.823
Like what?

15:49.823 --> 15:51.700
Like, remember the time
you stripped that snake
naked?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.869
Yeah.

15:53.869 --> 15:56.121
And remember the time
we went to the woods
to initiate you

15:56.121 --> 15:58.832
and we all ended up
in a trap, about to die?

15:59.750 --> 16:00.834
Good times.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.797
And remember the time
I pretended Ravi's food
was delicious

16:04.797 --> 16:06.382
and told everyone
they should eat it

16:06.674 --> 16:08.884
while secretly sneaking
Chinese food
for myself?

16:10.344 --> 16:11.345
Too soon?

16:11.887 --> 16:12.888
ALL: Yes!

16:13.681 --> 16:15.683
If we make contact
with the creature,

16:15.683 --> 16:16.725
I'll do the talking.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.020
How? What does a part-cow,
part-pig, part-duck
sound like?

16:20.020 --> 16:22.898
Moo-oink-quack-quack,
moo-oink!

16:24.858 --> 16:26.193
You speak
pig-duck-cow?

16:26.485 --> 16:27.945
What did
you say?

16:27.945 --> 16:31.031
Loosely translated,
"Please creature,
eat the tall one."

16:32.324 --> 16:33.659
I am the tall one.
(CHUCKLES)

16:34.159 --> 16:35.160
Hey!

16:36.537 --> 16:38.998
When we see it,
I'll take his picture,
and then, bam.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.792
I'll be the smart guy
who discovered
a new species.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.254
Wait, how did you get
my tablet? The office
is locked.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.798
Is everyone
at this camp
a cop?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.677
(SHUSHES)
Did you
hear that?

16:51.969 --> 16:53.262
The psycho
is coming
for us.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.056
I'm so sorry
my stupid
Chinese food

16:56.056 --> 16:57.224
got us
into this mess.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.976
It's okay.
We accept
your apology.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.686
Really?
No!

17:00.894 --> 17:02.563
But I don't want
the last thing I say
to be rude.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.609
We're out.

17:09.069 --> 17:09.820
Destiny!

17:10.154 --> 17:11.613
You picked
the lock
on the door?

17:11.905 --> 17:14.074
Yeah. Being
an escape artist

17:14.074 --> 17:16.410
got me first place
in the Miss Houdini
pageant.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.372
The girl who got
sawed in half
took second. A third.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.042
Hide!

17:26.837 --> 17:28.422
Are you ready
to see your creature

17:28.422 --> 17:30.883
and be immortalized
as a brilliant scientist?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.052
I am. Thanks
for believing
in me.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.012
You're welcome.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.556
And I'm sorry I ever
made you feel like
you're not smart.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.059
In your defense,
once it took me
six hours

17:40.059 --> 17:41.852
to get through
a revolving door.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.857
The psycho killer
is coming towards us.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.818
It's not here.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.361
Must have escaped.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.322
I've got this.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.365
Eat brick,
psycho!

17:55.699 --> 17:56.909
(GRUNTS)
Whoa! Stop!

17:56.909 --> 17:58.660
It's Ravi.
There's been
a mistake.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.120
There's been
no mistake!

18:00.120 --> 18:01.789
I never
trusted him!

18:01.789 --> 18:02.998
No, no.
Okay.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.793
We all want to see
Ravi get hit
with a branch,

18:06.043 --> 18:08.796
but we have more
important things
to worry about right now.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.923
The beast
got out
of its cage!

18:10.923 --> 18:12.508
What are you
talking about?

18:12.508 --> 18:13.842
We were
in the cage!

18:14.426 --> 18:16.303
Wait, are you
calling us beasts?

18:16.678 --> 18:18.847
Zuri, give me
that branch!
No!

18:19.348 --> 18:23.102
It's a new species
that has the bones
of a duck, cow and pig!

18:23.102 --> 18:25.479
And it escaped!
ALL: What?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.398
Oh, I see what's
going on, now.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.652
There's a perfectly
logical explanation
for all this.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.072
So, your perfectly legal,
logical explanation is,

18:35.072 --> 18:38.283
you've been eating
take-out, then burying
the bones to hide the fact

18:38.283 --> 18:39.827
that you hate
my food?
Hey!

18:40.160 --> 18:42.955
I said it was logical.
I didn't say you'd
like it.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.000
But then, why did you
support my 'Almost Meat;
cooking initiative?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.544
'Cause I was never
gonna eat it.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.673
But Ravi, there has to be
a creature out here.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.174
We saw the
blood splatter.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.761
And I heard the vicious
growling with my own
two hearing holes.

18:57.761 --> 18:58.929
(GROWLING)

19:01.598 --> 19:03.725
What? Y'all
want in on this?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.227
Well, tough tooties.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.981
For shame! I cannot
believe you'd lie
to me for...

19:10.440 --> 19:14.153
...Mmm. The most flavorful
morsel that has ever danced
upon my taste buds.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.698
Ravi, slow down.
I think you just
ate the bone.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.117
Hey, what about
the 'Almost Meat'?

19:20.117 --> 19:21.785
I thought you
loved that stuff.

19:21.785 --> 19:24.663
No way. It tasted like
broccoli cooked inside
a corpse that's colic.

19:26.081 --> 19:29.084
Well, that image is going
to run around my brain
a while.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.839
Okay, from now on
I will serve lean
real meat.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.049
Now, hook me up
with some sweet
and sour sauce.

19:38.969 --> 19:42.598
Oh, well, I can't believe
I didn't discover
a new species.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.809
I'm sorry, buddy.
I know that was
important to you.

19:46.101 --> 19:49.479
It wasn't only that.
I also wanted you
to think I was smart.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.150
Finn, you are,
and you're
a scientist now.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.277
You had a theory,
and you tested it.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.237
But I was proven wrong.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.281
All scientists
hit roadblocks.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.242
You just have
to keep trying.
You'll get there.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.829
So you think I still
might find a new
creature out here?

20:05.829 --> 20:07.706
Maybe, but remember,

20:07.956 --> 20:10.292
if you find a bunch
of old bones
and a used wet wipe,

20:10.667 --> 20:12.044
it's probably
just barbecue.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.173
Come on guys,
let's go home.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.843
Destiny, what's
the matter?

20:21.470 --> 20:24.473
It's past midnight,
and I didn't complete
the final task.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.808
So I'm not
an official
Woodchuck.

20:27.184 --> 20:30.062
At least we're not stuck
in a cage, about to be
killed by a psycho.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.396
So, cheer up.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.068
Wow, the bar for happiness
is really low around here.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.115
Wait a second.
The final task was to help
a Woodchuck in need.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.117
You freed us
from that cage.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.621
And we Woodchucks
really needed to get
out of there.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.417
You're right! That means
I completed the final
task. I did it!

20:52.709 --> 20:54.211
I'm a real
Woodchuck!

20:54.211 --> 20:55.254
Yay!

20:58.465 --> 21:00.717
DESTINY:
Don't you love this year's
official Woodchuck portrait?

21:01.134 --> 21:02.344
It's the best ever.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.097
And look, you didn't
even put a hat on me.

21:05.597 --> 21:09.226
No, I didn't have to.
Turns out, sweet and sour
sauce makes a great hair gel.

21:10.644 --> 21:15.190
Well, we finally have
four full-fledged
official Woodchucks.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.486
Actually, just one.
You guys still haven't done
the initiation ritual.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.158
Don't worry. I know
we can find a snake
who's itching for a rematch.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.415
Thanks for coming with me
to look for my toy car.

21:31.915 --> 21:35.627
No problem. And you
promise it's not
plastic this time?

21:35.919 --> 21:38.213
Of course not.
It's wood.

21:39.631 --> 21:43.051
What is so confusing
about a metal detector?

21:44.011 --> 21:47.639
Oh! I thought it was
a detector made
out of metal.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.350
(ANIMAL GRUNTING)

21:52.686 --> 21:53.729
Did you
hear that?

21:54.271 --> 21:55.480
Is that what
I think it is?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.691
No, it can't be.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.359
(ANIMAL GRUNTING)

22:01.445 --> 22:07.075
(MAKING ANIMAL NOISES)

22:07.909 --> 22:09.119
What did you
just say to it?

22:09.911 --> 22:10.912
Nothing.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.873
Did you just
tell it
to eat me?

22:13.332 --> 22:18.754
No, but, just in case
something was lost
in translation, run!
