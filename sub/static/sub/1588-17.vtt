(THUNDER CLAPPING)

00:49.183 --> 00:54.183
I don't think
it's made of cheese, do you?

00:54.422 --> 00:57.558
And if it was,
probably wouldn't taste good.

00:57.624 --> 01:00.293
Ever had gray cheese?

01:00.360 --> 01:02.629
So, I got a problem here.

01:02.696 --> 01:06.296
I haven't slept in days.

01:18.980 --> 01:22.616
It's gonna take a lot more
than milk and a binky
to help me sleep.

01:22.683 --> 01:27.487
See, my house, it's haunted.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.992
You don't believe me, do you?

01:32.059 --> 01:33.861
You think I'm being
a little kid.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.863
But I hear a moan at night.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.065
And sometimes
he even talks to me.

01:38.132 --> 01:41.902
(IMITATING GHOST) Beware,
I'm coming for you.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.738
Get this, I've seen him
with my own eyes.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.339
You will, too.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.742
(THUNDER CLAPPING)

02:15.769 --> 02:18.172
<i>Judging by Tuffy's
</i> <i>disappearing act,</i>

02:18.239 --> 02:20.474

</i> <i>of lightning, too.</i>

02:20.540 --> 02:24.890

03:21.368 --> 03:24.639
Come on, follow me.

03:24.706 --> 03:29.706
(WHISPERS) I usually
hear the ghost

03:53.867 --> 03:57.271

03:57.338 --> 04:02.338
It's a lot roomier in here
than you think.

04:02.977 --> 04:05.012
Let me show you around.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.347
And if you hear someone
moaning,

04:06.414 --> 04:08.882
don't be scared,
it's just a ghost.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.551
This is usually

I hear the chains every...

04:44.051 --> 04:46.386

get till the weekend.

Sorry, Mr. Cat.

It's dark in here.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.219

ghosts liked the dark.

You look just like a rat.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.330
I am.

08:16.397 --> 08:19.133
-A ghost rat?
-A rat rat.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.535
I didn't mean anybody no harm.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.972
I just needed a place for me
and my family to live.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.688
That's all.

08:30.277 --> 08:33.013
I figured the easiest way
to get rid of you

08:33.080 --> 08:36.380
was to scare you away.

sharing the place,
if you don't.

to feed, right?

I can't wait to meet

10:13.982 --> 10:17.152
Yeah, yeah,
it's gonna be great, kid.

10:17.218 --> 10:20.521
But maybe
you shouldn't do that
walking through walls thing

10:20.588 --> 10:23.157
till everyone
gets to know you.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.659

it's Milfred.
