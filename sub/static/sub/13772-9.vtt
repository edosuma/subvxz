trying to sneak out?

00:11.881 --> 00:13.361
No. I'm trying to get
comfortable

00:13.448 --> 00:15.189
in this crappy bed,
if you don't mind.

00:15.276 --> 00:18.409
Fine. Then you won't mind if I
stand right out here in the hall

Fascinating timeline, Reese.

01:20.732 --> 01:21.646
So let's see.

01:21.733 --> 01:22.691
It was the moon landing,

01:22.778 --> 01:25.520
the War of 1812,

01:25.607 --> 01:27.478
then the Lincoln-Kennedy
shoot-out.

01:27.565 --> 01:29.785
[laughter]

01:29.872 --> 01:32.744
It's embarrassing enough having
Reese in my class this year.

01:32.831 --> 01:35.965
What's worse is Herkabe's made
him his personal whipping boy.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.662
Reese, I'm just looking
through my notes here,

01:37.749 --> 01:40.622
and it appears that that was
your 20th wrong answer in a row.

01:40.709 --> 01:43.364
And you know what
that means, don't you?

01:45.453 --> 01:47.846
-Monkey dance?
-Your first right answer.

Well, let's not leave

Hey, come on in.

Hi, sweetie.

02:16.962 --> 02:19.008
Claire, you are a godsend.

02:19.095 --> 02:21.271
Thank you for taking him
on such short notice.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.707
Is this schedule
gonna work for you?

02:22.794 --> 02:24.056
Oh, good Lord, Lois.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.536
Any schedule works for me.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.408
What have I got
to do with my time?

Poke around a big, empty house,

We both know that's
not gonna happen.

Boy, you know, you raise them,
you put the through college,

02:34.850 --> 02:36.895
and loan them money to buy
a house, and suddenly,

02:36.982 --> 02:38.070
they don't need you anymore.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.376
God forbid you
should express

02:39.463 --> 02:40.421
a need to them. No.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.074
I could tell you stories...

-Bet you could.
-Yeah.

02:43.337 --> 02:45.165
Well, again, thank you.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.123
I'm glad to do it, honestly.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.125
Takes my mind off my shingles.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.083
Good Lord,
you've never felt pain

02:51.171 --> 02:52.607
like that in all
your waking days.

02:52.694 --> 02:53.912
It's just dreadful.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.479
Did I tell you about the pain?

02:55.566 --> 02:57.133
I think you did this morning.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.700
It's worse than my arthritis,
which is crippling.

02:58.787 --> 03:01.137
It feels like someone's
stabbing you all over

03:01.224 --> 03:02.878
with tiny, razor-sharp knives.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.010
-Oh, pray God you never
get it, Lois.
-Mmm.

Well, like I said,
I have a million things to do.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.631
You know, so do I, so do I.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.807
I have laundry stacked up

03:18.894 --> 03:20.243
just waiting for me.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.505
And I have so neglected
my scrapbooking

03:21.592 --> 03:22.637
that it's a scandal.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.421
Do you scrapbook, Lois?

03:24.508 --> 03:25.901
They've got
these really cute kits.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.424
It's a lot of fun.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.209
My niece Terri-- well,
she prefers Teresa,

03:29.296 --> 03:30.862
but she's a Terri--

03:30.949 --> 03:32.473
anyway, she got me
started on it.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.039
Well, what else is she
gonna do with herself?

03:34.126 --> 03:35.563
She's barren, poor thing.

You're still
mad at me?

You threw at my head, Dad.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.046
It was a brushback
pitch, Dewey.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.483
I got to protect the plate

me downtown all day.

-Hi.

03:48.532 --> 03:49.620
Did you do your vocab?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.361
Yeah. Wasn't so bad.

-Yeah, it was pretty easy.
-Yeah.

So I'll see you in school?

Talk to you later.

What was that about?

04:01.632 --> 04:03.330
That's Gina.
She's from my class.

I don't know.

I guess so.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.945
Well, you played
it cool, son.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.775
Maybe too cool.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.125
Feel this shoulder, Lois.

04:17.213 --> 04:18.822
It's like a sack
of burning jelly in there.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.390
Go ahead, give it a squeeze.

Uh, this is Claire,
Jamie's new babysitter.

Franklin's old house.

04:31.445 --> 04:32.489
Hey, that's a nice place.

04:32.576 --> 04:33.621
It is, it is on the outside.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.100
Of course it's full of dry rot.

the guy 50 times...

-Well, heck...

and have dinner with us?

special diet, Lois.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.898
It's been a bit
of an adjustment

04:49.985 --> 04:52.901
after the doctors took
out six feet of my colon.

I call it now?

I could sleep.

all night.

No, wait, no.

I start on my back.

I don't know.

I can't think anymore.

You're nothing but a bully
and a sadist, you know that?!

05:49.827 --> 05:51.133
How could you possibly take

05:51.220 --> 05:53.091
any satisfaction
in humiliating Reese?!

05:53.178 --> 05:54.354
It's Reese!

You have to stop this now!

-Well, well, well,
that took you long enough.
-What?

05:59.141 --> 06:01.012
I've been trying
to get your attention
since the semester began.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.753
I'm surprised you didn't
say something last week,

06:02.840 --> 06:05.060
when Reese was curled up
in a fetal ball under my desk.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.975
What do you want
from me?

06:07.062 --> 06:08.150
Come with me.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.110
I won it my senior year.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.982
The football trophy?

06:14.069 --> 06:15.853
Behind that.

06:15.940 --> 06:16.898
The soccer trophy?

06:16.985 --> 06:19.291
Behind that.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.815
There's just a bunch
of crappy ribbons.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.339
Behind
the spelling bee award.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.123
That thing that looks like
it broke off that other trophy?

06:25.210 --> 06:27.038
I cannot be responsible
for the myopic value

06:27.125 --> 06:30.564
this sports-obsessed
administration places
on academic achievement.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.741
But that little plaque
represents the highest GPA
in the history of the school,

06:33.828 --> 06:36.352
and it is mine,
Malcolm, all mine.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.310
-So what?
-So wha...

06:38.398 --> 06:40.835
I had to work hard
for that plaque.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.924
I had to score higher
than Edna Fornby,

06:43.011 --> 06:44.795
who'd held the title
for 38 years.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.884
A towering intellect,
blind since birth,

06:46.971 --> 06:48.625
went on to be a Rhodes scholar.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.714
Really classy lady.

06:50.801 --> 06:53.891
Cried like a baby

[inhales sharply]

06:55.066 --> 06:56.459
What a night.

06:56.546 --> 06:59.636
And now, you are on track
to take it from me.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.769
-What's your point?
-I can't let that happen.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.336
And if you don't want to see me
destroy your brother

07:04.424 --> 07:07.470
every day for the rest
of the year,

07:07.557 --> 07:09.167
you won't let it happen.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.561
-Are you serious?
-As a heart attack.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.955
Now, I can't just
give you a "B."

07:14.042 --> 07:15.478
People are watching.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.741
For some reason,
I rub people the wrong way.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.090
But that doesn't stop you

07:19.177 --> 07:20.657
from tanking the course
on your own.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.398
Are you really
that shallow and petty?

07:22.485 --> 07:24.966
You have no idea.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.141
So, you know,

07:26.228 --> 07:28.709
take a few days, think it over.

07:28.796 --> 07:31.189
It'll give me more time to think
up some challenges for Reese.

07:31.276 --> 07:35.063
Do you think hot coals would
set off the sprinkler system?

07:37.152 --> 07:39.284
Lois, I was just
gonna bring Jamie home.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.634
Thought I'd save you the trip.

-Come on, Jamie.
-[gasps]

07:41.852 --> 07:42.810
Thanks, Claire.
See you tomorrow.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.376
Won't you come in?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.335
I'd love to, but I have
such a busy schedule.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.555
I understand.

07:49.904 --> 07:51.340
Busy, busy, busy.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.211
No one has any time anymore.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.736
Oh, my goodness, I walked you
all the way home.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.389
You get out of those
work clothes,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.783
and I'll make some tea.

08:01.829 --> 08:04.614
Hey, Dewey, look at this.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.355
[beeping]

08:06.442 --> 08:08.183
I got the microwave to work
without closing the door.

08:08.270 --> 08:09.663
That's great, Dad.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.928
So, did you, uh, talk to Gina?

08:14.015 --> 08:16.321
-No.
-Oh.

08:16.408 --> 08:19.194
It's just that you said you
would talk to her later,

08:19.281 --> 08:22.676
and, I mean, if I
remember, she remembers.

08:22.763 --> 08:23.677
Maybe I'll talk to her
tomorrow.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.417
Tomorrow?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.942
Gee, Dewey, if I'm Gina, I
don't know what's going on.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.291
It's no big deal, Dad.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.814
Dewey!

08:30.901 --> 08:33.513
[sighs]
Get-- come here.

08:33.600 --> 08:37.429
Look... I know it's not easy
figuring this stuff out.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.128
You want to be with her, but you
just don't know what to say,

08:40.215 --> 08:42.130
and you feel like
such a doofus.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.523
I know.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.915
So here's what
you're gonna do:

08:45.002 --> 08:46.308
You're gonna go in
the house right now

08:46.395 --> 08:48.528
-and call her.
-Right now?

08:48.615 --> 08:51.182
Or you could wait till you're
old, toothless, alone,

08:51.269 --> 08:53.576
living in a welfare hotel,
hoping the couple

08:53.663 --> 08:56.274
screaming next door invites
you over to dinner sometime.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.711
It's up to you.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.279
It's called "leaky gut."

09:02.890 --> 09:04.152
Hal.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.806
Why don't we go out to dinner?

09:05.893 --> 09:07.329
Doesn't that sound good?

09:07.416 --> 09:08.809
Well, I'm helping Dewey
with a project, hon.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.375
Why don't you go
with Claire?

09:10.462 --> 09:12.900
When it's quiet, you
can hear it dripping.

09:15.990 --> 09:16.991
Hear that?

09:18.253 --> 09:19.254
You ready?

09:19.341 --> 09:20.255
No, wait.

09:20.342 --> 09:21.648
I need more time.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.388
Believe me,
I have been through it.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.956
You just want to run away,
hide under the covers and cry.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.262
But you know what?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.264
That's how you know
you're a man.

09:29.351 --> 09:30.918
[line ringing]

09:33.616 --> 09:34.791
GINA: Hello?

09:38.795 --> 09:40.449
GINA: Hello?

09:41.885 --> 09:42.973
Hello.

09:43.060 --> 09:46.498
Gina. Hi, this is Dewey's dad.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.109
[chuckles]
He just called

09:48.196 --> 09:51.634
to say that he
was thinking of you.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.375
Oh, and-and he thinks
that homework is dumb.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.551
[chuckles]
Really?

09:55.638 --> 09:57.597
She thinks homework
is dumb, too.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.989
Wow!

10:06.736 --> 10:09.043
Reese.
I think it's terrible

10:09.130 --> 10:12.133
what Herkabe's been
putting you through in class.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.309
I really feel bad
about the way he's treating you.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.355
I'll bet I could
make you feel worse!

10:19.009 --> 10:21.055
[sighs]
I thought it over.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.491
What happened to your lip?

10:22.578 --> 10:25.146
-Reese.
-He's a troubled young man.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.538
God knows I've tried
my best with him,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.976
but you can't let
that fact poison...

10:29.063 --> 10:30.368
Relax, I'm gonna do it.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.848
-You will?
-Reese can't help who he is.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.284
And you can't
help being a jerk.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.809
I'm the only one who has
a choice over what I do.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.419
So, yeah, I'll take
your sick little deal

10:37.506 --> 10:40.596
so you can keep your pathetic,
meaningless plaque.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.120
Thank you, Malcolm.
I know that you think
that this compromised victory

10:43.207 --> 10:45.122
will taste like ashes
in my mouth,

10:45.209 --> 10:48.169
but there's something
I learned a long time ago.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.824
Ashes don't taste that bad.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.608
[bell ringing]

10:52.695 --> 10:55.785
Okay, class, we'll start
this morning with an oral quiz.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.048
Who was the victor

10:58.135 --> 11:01.486
in the disputed presidential
election of 1896?

11:01.573 --> 11:02.879
Um...

11:05.490 --> 11:06.883
Malcolm?

11:08.232 --> 11:10.017
Surely you know this.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.107
[sighs and mumbles]
Tilden.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.978
-What was that?
-Tilden!

11:15.065 --> 11:17.285
That's incorrect.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.461
[class muttering]

11:19.548 --> 11:21.289
What an idiot!

11:21.376 --> 11:23.639
Monkey dance! Monkey dance!

11:23.726 --> 11:25.510
Monkey dance!
Monkey dance!

11:25.597 --> 11:27.861
Monkey dance! Monkey dance!

11:36.870 --> 11:39.220
-We have a problem.
-What?

11:39.307 --> 11:41.875
Some wavy-haired blond boy
was chatting up Gina

11:41.962 --> 11:43.398
at the bike racks after school.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.269
Don't you work, Dad?

11:45.356 --> 11:47.184
Never mind that. The point is,
you should have been there.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.490
It was probably Stephan.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.100
He's no threat.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.101
I saw him, Dewey.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.929
He's an Adonis!

11:53.016 --> 11:56.106
Okay, what you need here is
some sort of romantic gesture.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.673
-What do you mean?
-Just off the top

11:57.760 --> 11:58.805
of my head, you could send her

11:58.892 --> 12:00.545
a nice box
of expensive chocolates.

12:00.632 --> 12:01.851
Not sure.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.157
Too late. You already did.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.419
You just dropped
off a big box

12:04.506 --> 12:05.681
on her front doorstep,

12:05.768 --> 12:07.117
rang the bell
and ran like hell.

12:07.204 --> 12:08.728
You also trampled
some of her rosebushes.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.120
Congratulations, son.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.253
You're in the game.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.604
Hal, I have to
do something
about Claire.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.649
She is driving
me crazy.

12:19.086 --> 12:22.393
Oh, Hal, that
is so sweet.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.917
It's not for you.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.180
[sighs]

12:26.267 --> 12:28.573
Didn't you learn your
lesson with Francis?

12:28.660 --> 12:30.445
That Jenny Thompson
was a stuck-up snot.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.316
Hal, I have
bigger problems.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.797
I cannot stand
that woman.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.407
Which normally
isn't an issue,

12:36.494 --> 12:38.322
except I can't afford to
tell her off and lose her.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.847
She's good with Jamie.
She's right down the street.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.587
She's incredibly cheap.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.546
She'd be perfect if she
weren't the most annoying person

12:44.633 --> 12:46.200
on the face
of the planet.

12:46.287 --> 12:47.723
I feel like the top of my head
is going to explode

12:47.810 --> 12:49.290
if I hear her
say another word.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.552
What rhymes with dreamy?

12:50.639 --> 12:52.423
Hal, for God's sake.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.425
I heard what you said, Lois.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.906
Look, you just have to
completely disengage with her.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.691
Take Jamie when she drops
him off, nod pleasantly--

12:59.779 --> 13:02.390
you can even smile-- and then,
slam the door in her face.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.000
And don't beat yourself up
over it.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.655
Some people are just crazy.

13:06.742 --> 13:09.049
Do we have any fun stickers?

13:16.230 --> 13:17.753
-STUDENT: Whoa.
-B-minus! Ha!

13:17.840 --> 13:19.624
I did better than you.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.583
For the first time...

13:21.670 --> 13:22.758
Wait.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.326
[whispers]
A, B, C, D...

13:25.413 --> 13:26.457
Never mind.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.896
Buck up, Malc.
Only 12 more weeks,

13:29.983 --> 13:31.462
and then I'll back off

13:31.549 --> 13:33.247
and let you pick the course
you want to tank.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.075
Hey, we're not in your stupid
class anymore, all right?

13:35.162 --> 13:36.424
Will you just
leave me alone?

13:36.511 --> 13:37.512
Oh, a sullen rebuke.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.209
What a bonus.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.733
You know, I might make them
get me a bigger plaque

13:41.821 --> 13:43.692
when I beat you, Malcolm.

13:43.779 --> 13:47.478
Ugh! How can they let it
get so dingy? Hey, Slick!

13:47.565 --> 13:49.524
Instead of pushing
dust around over there,

13:49.611 --> 13:50.830
why don't you polish up
these trophies?

13:50.917 --> 13:52.048
It's disgraceful.

13:53.528 --> 13:54.746
[sighs]
You know, I'll admit,

13:54.834 --> 13:56.357
it wasn't easy
beating old Fornby.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.967
Of course she had
the added advantage

13:58.054 --> 13:59.839
of being blind and club-footed,
no distractions,

13:59.926 --> 14:02.406
but still, I had to bust my hump
that last semester.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.234
Did you know, instead
of seventh period gym,

14:04.321 --> 14:06.193
I created my own AP class?

14:06.280 --> 14:08.499
While those Cro-Magnons
were chasing balls

14:08.586 --> 14:09.936
and sweating like swine,

14:10.023 --> 14:11.589
I was sitting
in an air-conditioned room

14:11.676 --> 14:14.505
with my tie unloosed,
discussing Renaissance poetry.

14:14.592 --> 14:15.724
You wore a suit to school?

14:15.811 --> 14:17.378
And a silk handkerchief.

14:17.465 --> 14:21.208
They hated me because
I made them look ridiculous.

14:22.252 --> 14:25.995
Okay, Dewey, you set the table
with the box of candy.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.563
Now it's time to reap
your reward.

14:28.650 --> 14:31.522
She's not going to feel like
I'm trying to buy her, is she?

14:31.609 --> 14:34.221
Let me teach you a valuable
lesson about women, Dewey.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.527
They think they deserve
everything you give them.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.399
They all like to think
they're special,

14:38.486 --> 14:39.879
even the ones that aren't.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.489
Now go.

14:41.576 --> 14:42.751
[doorbell rings]

14:43.795 --> 14:45.667
You can do it, son!

14:49.018 --> 14:49.976
Yes?

14:50.063 --> 14:51.934
Um...

14:52.021 --> 14:54.023
is Gina home?

14:54.110 --> 14:55.590
Are you the kid that
sent her that candy?

14:55.677 --> 14:58.506
Um... maybe.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.029
Don't you know she's
allergic to nuts?

15:02.727 --> 15:04.468
[gasps]

15:04.555 --> 15:05.948
Oh, God.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.515
[tires squealing]

15:11.345 --> 15:12.563
Hello, Lois.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.217
Hi, sweetie.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.871
I made you a snack
in the kitchen.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.699
What a day.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.832
Jamie was fine, but I got that
horrible ringing in my ear.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.138
It was just dreadful.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.661
Do you ever get that?

15:23.748 --> 15:25.402
Well, you're blessed
if you don't.

15:25.489 --> 15:26.882
I never noticed those
cushions before.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.231
They're darling.

15:28.318 --> 15:29.667
What did you
pay for them?

15:29.754 --> 15:31.713
They look so comfortable.
Mind if I try 'em out?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.149
I'd like you to go now, Claire.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.064
Oh, good, because I have
a ton of things to do.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.849
You know how it is, though,
something always comes up.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.504
What I would like is for you
to be in your own house now.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.115
Boy, so would I.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.812
I really have to clean
my bathroom tile grout.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.248
It's disgusting.

15:45.335 --> 15:48.643
Get your fat butt
out of my house!

15:49.644 --> 15:51.559
[laughs]
Oh, Lois, you're so funny.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.517
Although, I could lose
a little weight here...

15:53.604 --> 15:55.476
Get out! Get out! Get out!

15:55.563 --> 15:56.694
Get out! Get out!

15:56.781 --> 15:58.696
[shouting]
Get out!

15:58.783 --> 16:00.307
Wow. Where did that come from?

16:00.394 --> 16:01.786
I have put up with this

16:01.873 --> 16:03.658
this long because I
needed you for Jamie,

16:03.745 --> 16:05.138
but I've had it, lady.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.227
I'll send you a check
for the money I owe you,

16:07.314 --> 16:09.055
and after that, I never want
to see your face again.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.665
Well, now, I...

16:18.455 --> 16:21.893
Okay, I'm glad we finally
got all that out in the open,

16:21.981 --> 16:23.417
'cause now that we know
we have issues,

16:23.504 --> 16:25.027
we can talk about them.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.032
You can't do this.
Just because I missed

16:30.119 --> 16:31.860
one stupid gym class!

16:34.080 --> 16:35.951
Oh.

16:36.038 --> 16:39.215
It is a dark day
for North High,

16:39.302 --> 16:42.653
but given recent information
that has come to our attention

16:42.740 --> 16:44.307
regarding the previous GPA

16:44.394 --> 16:46.179
record holder and his failure

16:46.266 --> 16:48.181
to meet the physical
education requirement,

16:48.268 --> 16:49.704
I have no choice.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.446
I take no pleasure...

16:52.533 --> 16:54.404
in the pain
this unfortunate incident

16:54.491 --> 16:55.710
has caused, but rules

16:55.797 --> 16:57.755
are rules.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.106
So! I am directing

17:00.193 --> 17:04.066
that this plaque be returned
to Edna Fornby,

17:04.153 --> 17:07.200
who though blind and crippled,
managed to pass gym.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.595
Tough break, Mr. Herkabe.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.684
I know it was you, Malcolm.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.685
And I wouldn't be
so quick to gloat.
I'm not defeated yet.

17:15.772 --> 17:18.733
I am like Napoleon
at St. Helena,
plotting my return.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.647
You mean Elba.
He died on St. Helena.

17:20.734 --> 17:22.563
Oh, shut up!

17:22.650 --> 17:25.479
I have to call Mother before
she hears it from someone else.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.481
[door shuts]

17:27.568 --> 17:29.396
Hey, honey.
[sighs]

17:29.483 --> 17:31.398
Hal, it's terrible.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.747
Oh, what happened?

17:32.834 --> 17:34.531
Claire died.

17:34.618 --> 17:37.186
-What?
-Her sister just called.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.101
I guess no one
really saw it coming.

17:39.188 --> 17:41.234
I feel so bad.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.757
[sniffs]

17:42.844 --> 17:44.324
Are you baking cookies?

17:44.411 --> 17:46.282
Snickerdoodles.

17:46.369 --> 17:49.285
Boy, life is so precarious,
isn't it?

17:49.372 --> 17:50.721
You know, just yesterday,

17:50.808 --> 17:53.333
she was sitting right
here, and then...

17:53.420 --> 17:54.856
Hal, you know
what I just thought of?

17:54.943 --> 17:56.423
We never go dancing.

17:56.510 --> 17:57.989
Why don't we go dancing tonight?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.253
Doesn't that sound like fun?

18:00.340 --> 18:02.429
Yeah, sure.
[chuckles weakly]

18:02.516 --> 18:03.430
I guess.

18:03.517 --> 18:04.692
[door shuts]

18:06.433 --> 18:07.477
Excuse me, honey.

18:07.564 --> 18:08.565
[door slams]

18:11.568 --> 18:12.743
You okay?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.833
Oh...

18:18.358 --> 18:20.142
Ah.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.144
You know, I've been thinking.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.799
Maybe she's not
the right girl for you.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.193
She sure has made this
hard on us.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.455
There's no "us," Dad.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.152
It's you.

18:30.239 --> 18:33.286
Every idea you have
about girls is wrong.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.157
How was I ever born?

18:35.244 --> 18:36.854
Well, by that time,
your mother was pretty much

18:36.941 --> 18:38.900
stuck in the relationship,
and...

18:38.987 --> 18:40.728
Thanks a lot, Dad.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.121
I liked Gina.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.513
I really did.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.124
I'm sorry, Dewey.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.560
I feel terrible.

18:46.647 --> 18:47.996
Maybe there's some way
I can help you...

18:48.083 --> 18:49.476
-No!
-Okay, right.

18:49.563 --> 18:52.000
I will stay out of it.

18:52.087 --> 18:54.263
I can make this right.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.525
I have better candy.

18:55.612 --> 18:58.049
You'll like this candy.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.486
It's really good.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.357
Come on, just hop in the car.

19:01.444 --> 19:04.969
Oh! Come on, give me a break.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.928
Don't you remember
your first love?

19:07.015 --> 19:08.451
[grunts]

19:10.018 --> 19:12.673
[silly rhythmic breathing]

19:12.760 --> 19:13.978
What are you doing here?

19:14.065 --> 19:14.979
Reclaiming what is
rightfully mine.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.111
Once I complete this course,

19:16.198 --> 19:17.765
they'll be forced
to reinstate me.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.723
You can't take a class
20 years later.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.116
Who is being petty,
now, Malcolm?

19:21.203 --> 19:22.552
No, no, no.
You will soon discover

19:22.639 --> 19:24.380
what my cable
guy learned the hard way:

19:24.467 --> 19:27.601
you can't defeat Lionel Herkabe.
You see, Malcolm...

19:27.688 --> 19:29.342
BOY: Oh!

19:29.429 --> 19:31.213
Hey, Mr. Herkabe.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.562
-[grunts]
-How do you like dodgeball?

19:32.649 --> 19:33.868
Oh, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

19:33.955 --> 19:35.304
[loud, wheezy groan]

19:35.391 --> 19:36.392
You are just making yourself

19:36.479 --> 19:39.134
look weak and foolish!

19:39.221 --> 19:41.180
I might stop hitting you
if you dance like a monkey.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.791
Like...

19:43.878 --> 19:45.358
like this?

19:45.445 --> 19:48.187
You call that a monkey dance?

19:48.274 --> 19:50.406
[grunts]
[class laughing, jeering]

19:50.493 --> 19:52.278
HERKABE:
God, that really burns!

19:52.365 --> 19:54.497
Some things
you don't do for trophies.

19:54.584 --> 19:58.153
You treasure them here
where it counts the most.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.763
HERKABE:
Oh, you think that hurt?

19:59.850 --> 20:00.895
This didn't hurt.

20:00.982 --> 20:04.333
Oh, God, make it stop!

20:04.420 --> 20:06.161
No one can take that away.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.423
Oh!

20:19.305 --> 20:20.219
Hi.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.698
Hi.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.921
Your dad's really weird.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.532
You have no idea.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.056
You want to eat lunch
together tomorrow?

20:32.143 --> 20:33.580
Okay.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.625
Bye.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.627
Bye.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.849
Sorry to bother you.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.677
I'm Claire's sister, Donna.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.548
Oh, hi. Hi.

20:45.635 --> 20:46.723
Come on in.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.508
I don't want to impose.

20:48.595 --> 20:51.293
I just want to thank you
for being so nice to my sister.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.990
She often spoke of you.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.601
Oh. Well, you know, I
thought the world of her.

20:54.688 --> 20:55.732
Come on now, Lois.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.386
I think we both know

20:57.473 --> 20:59.083
that Claire required
a certain amount of patience.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.607
Am I right?

21:00.694 --> 21:03.000
[both laugh]

21:03.087 --> 21:05.655
Anyway, you wouldn't believe
the flight I took coming here.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.962
First, they grounded the plane,
which, you know, you think,

21:08.049 --> 21:10.312
better they do that
than trying to fly it
with something wrong.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.532
Then they said they're going
to fix it, and I'm thinking,

21:12.619 --> 21:14.055
-"Oh!"
-You know, Donna, I'm sorry,

21:14.142 --> 21:16.057
but you happened to catch
me at a really busy time.

21:16.144 --> 21:17.624
Oh, you think you're busy.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.103
Try planning a funeral.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.670
Not that I'm complaining...
