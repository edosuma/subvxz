Black Widow!

00:32.232 --> 00:34.833
Argh, how do you
stand this noise?

00:34.835 --> 00:36.068
(GRUNTING)

00:36.070 --> 00:37.569
What's wrong, Hulk?

00:37.571 --> 00:39.705
I thought music was supposed
to soothe the savage...

00:39.707 --> 00:41.407
You know, you.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.211
I only like music
I can smash to.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.247
Something heavy.
(GRUNTING)

00:48.249 --> 00:49.615
And metal. (GRUNTING)

00:55.889 --> 00:58.390
(GRUNTING)

00:58.392 --> 01:01.994

It's fine. My workout
was done anyway.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.270
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

01:11.272 --> 01:14.206
THOR: Inhumans.
Secretive superhuman people.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.375
Keepers of the Terrigen Mist.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.177
Terrigen transforms them.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.079
Sometimes,
with monstrous results.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.547
(GROWLING)

01:21.549 --> 01:23.682
Terrigen Mist has
no effect on humans.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.585
And yet somehow it turned
a human kid into Inferno.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.420
Maybe the kid wasn't human?

01:28.422 --> 01:31.523
What if Inferno was really
an Inhuman and didn't know it?

01:31.525 --> 01:33.258
IRON MAN:
If Inferno was Inhuman,

01:33.260 --> 01:35.727
how'd he wind up in
upstate New York?

01:35.729 --> 01:37.129
It doesn't make any sense.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.297
Scary.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.132
Living a normal
human existence,

01:40.134 --> 01:43.202
then in a random moment
it's taken away from
you forever.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.104
Changed into something else.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.239
(SIGHING)
Welcome to my world.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.041
HAWKEYE: You know
what else is weird?

01:49.043 --> 01:51.543
We make all friendly with
Black Bolt and the Inhumans

01:51.545 --> 01:53.712
but since Inferno went
to go live with them,

01:53.714 --> 01:54.980
we haven't heard a thing.

01:56.316 --> 01:57.649
HAWKEYE: And right on cue.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.457
Uh-oh.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.330
HAWKEYE: Oh.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.831
Since I can't ask the dog,

02:12.833 --> 02:15.400
anybody know where
he teleported us to?

02:15.402 --> 02:18.804
Aye, Hawkeye. This appears
to be the Inhuman homeland.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.706
Attilan.

02:23.776 --> 02:24.877
(GROWLING)

02:25.178 --> 02:26.845

02:38.825 --> 02:40.893
(THEME MUSIC PLAYS)

02:47.300 --> 02:49.134
FALCON: So, this is
what Attilan is like.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.335
It's not what I pictured.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.470
It's still nice though.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.338
Other than the killer robots.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.177
Avengers, hit 'em
up the middle!

(WHIRRING)

03:13.893 --> 03:15.194
(GRUNTING)

03:15.196 --> 03:16.862
Is this really Inhuman tech?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.297
The design looks familiar.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.233
HULK: Who cares?
Just keep smashing!

03:21.235 --> 03:22.467
There are too many of them!

03:22.469 --> 03:24.236
FALCON:
We're gonna be overrun!

03:32.412 --> 03:34.546
Captain America.

03:34.548 --> 03:38.183
His Royal Highness Black Bolt
beckons you Avengers to
retreat into the palace.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.052
You heard The Seeker.
Fall back!

03:58.338 --> 04:02.407
Okay, Black Bolt, tell us
what's happening here.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.711
Without actually telling us
what's happening here.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.779
THE SEEKER: These robots,

04:07.781 --> 04:10.515
since taking over Attilan,
they've hunted and captured
Inhumans.

04:10.517 --> 04:14.620
Including the new citizen
Inferno and nearly all
of the royal family.

04:14.622 --> 04:17.122
Thus, Black Bolt sent
Lockjaw for you.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.524
No one else is left to defend
Attilan from the robots

04:19.526 --> 04:21.326
and their ruthless leader.

04:29.369 --> 04:30.402
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Ultron!

04:30.404 --> 04:32.437
The Avengers.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.539
Your presence here
is unexpected.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.476
And ultimately insignificant.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.544
IRON MAN: Ultron is
back in one piece.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.213
Let's remedy that.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.452
Bravado in the face of
certain annihilation.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.955
The Inhumans felt
the same way.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.456
Before I conquered them.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.326

04:58.564 --> 05:00.532

05:02.068 --> 05:04.436
Such chaos and disorder.

05:04.438 --> 05:07.339
Is there any question
why you must be eliminated...

05:10.910 --> 05:12.010
Whoa!

05:13.946 --> 05:16.148
It feels like this every time
we tangle with Ultron,

05:16.150 --> 05:18.050
but he's even more
kick-butt than the last time.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.494
Lockjaw, teleport
us away, now.
(GROANING)

05:33.433 --> 05:34.733
(YELLING)

05:39.439 --> 05:40.605
(YELLING)

05:44.043 --> 05:45.110
Where did they...

05:45.478 --> 05:46.545
Huh?

05:51.951 --> 05:54.286
HULK: Just when the
fight was getting good.

05:54.288 --> 05:56.154
FALCON: Hulk, you think
all fights are good.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.889
What is this place?

05:57.891 --> 06:00.826
A secret lab built in
the ancient catacombs
beneath Attilan.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.861
It has served as a
safe base of operations

06:02.863 --> 06:05.697
in our struggles against
Ultron and his robots.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.233
IRON MAN: Ultron doesn't do
anything without a reason.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.369
So, what is it he wants
with the Inhumans?

06:12.238 --> 06:14.539
Where's he going?
Hmm?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.575
FALCON: Maybe Ultron wants
something from Attilan?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.510
A resource or something?

06:18.512 --> 06:19.845
A strategic base?

06:19.847 --> 06:23.548
And it appears we
lost our interpreter.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.517
BLACK WIDOW:
Nice setup you have here.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.487
Ultron seizing Attilan
has slowed my research,

06:28.489 --> 06:31.757
but I have still managed
a breakthrough.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.593
My experiments have revealed
conclusively that Inferno

06:34.595 --> 06:37.529
was actually a latent Inhuman.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.897
And he didn't know?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.432
How is that possible?

06:40.434 --> 06:43.402
Humans and Inhumans must have
lived together in the past.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.437
Their descendants
possess Inhuman DNA.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.439
Descendants like Inferno.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.175
Who knows how many of my
kind are living among humans

06:50.177 --> 06:52.577
and don't even know
that they're one of us.

06:52.579 --> 06:56.681
Imagine if the Terrigen
accident that created
Inferno had been bigger...

06:56.683 --> 07:00.352
That is one big crystal
of Terrigen Mist.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.187
This is only a prototype

07:02.189 --> 07:05.290
but a device like this
could awaken a new
generation of Inhumans

07:05.292 --> 07:07.793
with unimaginable powers.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.429
You can't just expose
people to the Mist.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.431
What if they don't
want powers?

07:12.433 --> 07:14.433
You'd be making the
decision for them.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.601
Yeah, but then again,

07:16.603 --> 07:19.337
we don't always get
to choose our destiny.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.606
THE SEEKER: Indeed.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.475
(GROANING)

07:24.577 --> 07:25.977

07:27.447 --> 07:28.547
Seeker!

07:28.549 --> 07:29.781
(LAUGHING)

07:29.783 --> 07:31.316
What are you doing?

07:31.318 --> 07:33.485
ULTRON: Exactly...

07:33.487 --> 07:35.454
What he was told.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.890
Something's wrong.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.460
FALCON: Ultron's found us.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.963
(WHIRRING)

07:44.965 --> 07:47.499
(STRAINING)
THE SEEKER: This is only
a small-scale version

07:47.501 --> 07:49.935
of my Terrigen
dispersal device.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.837
Terrigen dispersal?

07:51.839 --> 07:54.739
You want to help
The Seeker find more Inhumans?

07:54.741 --> 07:57.309
I care nothing for Inhumans.

07:57.311 --> 08:00.412
But I needed this device
for my own purposes.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.581
Tricking The Seeker
into designing it for me...

08:02.583 --> 08:04.983
What?
And betraying his own people,

08:04.985 --> 08:06.585
was most simple.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.686
But we had a deal!

08:07.688 --> 08:10.555
And without the crystal,
the device will only...

08:11.524 --> 08:13.758
(SCREAMING)
(CLINKS)

08:14.961 --> 08:16.528
Disappointing.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.798
The prototype merely
phase-shifted The Seeker away.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.267
I'll have to
increase its power.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.169
After I get rid of you.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.408
BLACK WIDOW:
Hulk, can you smash?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.477
(STRUGGLING)

08:32.479 --> 08:34.044
Can't smash the net,

08:34.047 --> 08:36.248
but I can smash the wall.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.582
(GRUNTING)

08:39.118 --> 08:42.287
Huh. You're only delaying
the inevitable.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.634
(GRUNTS)
(YELLS)

08:58.538 --> 09:00.705
Ultron's got some new toys.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.275

we get to break 'em.

Lockjaw! Ultron,

09:51.525 --> 09:53.959
when I'm done with you,
you're gonna need a mechanic.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.193
(GRUNTING)

09:58.598 --> 10:03.001
It is more efficient to
destroy you with the rest
of your pathetic species.

10:07.807 --> 10:08.640
(BEEPING)

10:09.742 --> 10:10.809
Huh?

10:13.312 --> 10:15.447
Your actions serve no purpose.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.716
I have your family
and I have your city.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.818
And soon, I will have you.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.455
Temper, temper.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.791
Black Bolt, wait!

10:26.793 --> 10:28.560
Falcon, Hawkeye, with me.

10:35.001 --> 10:36.801
Fire in the hole!

10:42.942 --> 10:46.111
CAPTAIN AMERICA: <i> Avengers,</i>
<i>comlink signal's weak</i>
<i>but if you can hear me,</i>

10:46.113 --> 10:49.280
<i>use this transmission</i>

10:49.282 --> 10:53.351
<i>We're after Ultron. It looks like he's</i>
<i>trying to escape out</i> <i>the bottom of Attilan.</i>

10:54.120 --> 10:55.787
Bottom of Attilan?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.622
Seeker mentioned old tunnels.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.457
We can use them to
make our way down.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.993
(GRUNTING) You go
ahead, I'll catch up.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.833
I wish Black Bolt could
tell us more about what
he's thinking.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.202
He can't talk because his
voice could level a city.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.772
Must be frustrating not
to be able to communicate.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.775
I think what Black Bolt wants
now, is for us to shut up.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.677
HAWKEYE: Oh, how can you tell?

11:20.813 --> 11:21.880
Call it a hunch.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.989
Humans and Inhumans.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.657
So similar.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.894
Your predictability dooms
you both as a species.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.763
Now, just hold still.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.491

12:15.367 --> 12:17.936
I'm sorry, did you
say something?

12:22.708 --> 12:26.010
Well, at least now we
know what Black Bolt's
voice sounds like.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.612
And it ain't pleasant.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.282
It's not over yet.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.551
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
The royal family and Inferno.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.121
Everyone... except Black Bolt.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.795
Tony, take Hulk and Widow.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.430
Find Ultron and Black Bolt.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.999
The rest of us will
get the Inhumans out
then catch up.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.536
Inferno.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.371
You never should
have been here.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.474
You should be home
with your family.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.143
He never got a choice.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.944
He didn't ask to
become Inferno.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.613
You didn't ask to become Hulk.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.615
I didn't ask to become
the Black Widow.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.818
Like I said, people don't
always get to choose.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.620
But they should.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.756
No little kid should
have been forced to be
a KGB sleeper agent.

13:11.758 --> 13:14.826
And no little kid
should be forced to be
changed into an Inhuman.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.829
Terrigen or Gamma,
ballerina or superhero.

13:17.831 --> 13:18.930
It don't matter.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.832
It's all on the outside.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.502
Doesn't change who
you are on the inside.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.639
Lockjaw, are you strong
enough to teleport your
family somewhere safe?

13:27.641 --> 13:28.840
(GROWLING)

13:28.842 --> 13:30.675
I'll take that as a yes.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.310
I promise we'll get
Black Bolt back.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.045
(BARKING)
Aww. Ugh!

13:35.648 --> 13:37.248
Ugh, it smells.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.097
(WHIRRING)

14:03.042 --> 14:04.642
It's The Seeker's weapon.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.477
Only Ultron's
built one bigger.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.047
Ultron, let Black Bolt go.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.882
It's us you want.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.151
Don't flatter yourselves.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.887
ULTRON: I want to use
Attilan as my base

14:15.889 --> 14:19.657
to completely wipe humanity
off the face of the earth.

14:19.659 --> 14:23.361
And to use Black Bolt to
power the weapon to do it.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.367
If the pain gets too much,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.569
feel free to speak up,
Your Highness.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.805
In fact, I'm counting on it.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.178

14:43.048 --> 14:43.915
No!

14:47.653 --> 14:48.887
(GRUNTING)

14:50.389 --> 14:52.090
(GRUNTING)
You can't hold me.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.925
You gotta let me go!

14:53.927 --> 14:56.327
(GRUNTING)
You should know by now,

14:56.329 --> 14:58.062
I never let go

14:58.064 --> 14:59.397
of anything.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.336
Natasha, no!

15:06.505 --> 15:08.006
(BOTH GRUNT)

15:08.574 --> 15:10.108
I have you.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.250
Uh, little help?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.185
HAWKEYE: Iron Man
asking for help?

15:21.187 --> 15:23.021
I'm gonna remember this day.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.260
Hold, Black Bolt!

15:29.262 --> 15:31.095
I will free you.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.132
You will do no such thing.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.834
(SCREAMING)

15:37.903 --> 15:40.104
You should have let me go!

15:40.106 --> 15:41.372
But thanks.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.642
(YELLING)

15:46.445 --> 15:47.845
(ECHOING MOAN)

15:49.882 --> 15:51.916
That weapon's gonna
amplify his scream

15:51.918 --> 15:53.284
straight down
into the Earth.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.720
No one could survive a
blast of that magnitude.

15:55.722 --> 15:56.955
HAWKEYE: Okay, new rule...

15:56.957 --> 15:58.389
Silence is golden.

15:59.558 --> 16:00.858
(WHIRRING)

16:00.860 --> 16:02.493
Activate Redwing,
auto-fire!

16:05.431 --> 16:08.466
We have to get Black
Bolt out of that thing
before it fries him.

16:09.935 --> 16:11.936
FALCON: Stop!

16:11.938 --> 16:14.238
Ultron's designed this
with some kind of
pain feedback loop.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.108
The more we mess with it
the more it zaps Black Bolt.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.277
ULTRON: It's over, Avengers.

16:19.279 --> 16:22.814
The weapon cannot be
stopped from firing.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.649
(THOR GRUNTING)

16:24.651 --> 16:26.517
He's right.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.086

16:29.254 --> 16:31.022
BLACK WIDOW: Hulk, with me!

16:32.024 --> 16:33.524
IRON MAN: I have an idea,

16:33.526 --> 16:36.160
but I need everyone
to keep Ultron and his
robots distracted.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.097
Roger that.
One distraction coming up.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.865
Redwing engage!

16:43.202 --> 16:44.769
(GRUNTING)

16:51.210 --> 16:54.012
Do you think a mere flash
arrow will do anything to...

(GRUNTING)

16:59.018 --> 17:00.651
(GRUNTING)

17:00.653 --> 17:02.387
It has to be around
here somewhere.

17:10.162 --> 17:13.231
Argh! Okay, new plan.

17:21.173 --> 17:24.642
There, at this distance
without an amplifier,

17:24.644 --> 17:27.211
his voice won't give Earth
much more than an earache.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.378
ULTRON: You are correct.

17:30.582 --> 17:32.817
(GRUNTING)

17:32.819 --> 17:36.054
Fortunately you have provided
me with a backup amplifier.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.724
Your arc reactor.

can't hold out much longer.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.278
(ROARING)

18:01.947 --> 18:04.282
What are you gonna do with
that Terrigen crystal?

18:04.284 --> 18:05.550
Ultron was right.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.919
We can't stop the
weapon from firing

18:07.921 --> 18:09.087
but neither can he.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.422
So, you're changing
Ultron's death ray?

18:11.424 --> 18:14.258
Back into a Terrigen
dispersal device.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.527
For most of Earth,
it'll be harmless.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.564
HULK: The people with any
Inhuman DNA are gonna
suddenly get powers.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.365
What about what you said?

18:21.367 --> 18:23.134
About destiny and choice?

18:23.136 --> 18:26.037
Ultron means to destroy
everyone on Earth.

18:26.039 --> 18:28.272
We're not giving
people a choice,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.308
but we're giving
them a chance.

I think Lockjaw is
saying thanks.

'Tis folly to think we've
seen the last of Ultron.

here on Earth,

Black Bolt and his people are
gonna have to open up more.

want to protect the new
generation of Inhumans.

a bunch of folks are
gonna have new powers.

are gonna behave.
