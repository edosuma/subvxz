You better shut
your damn mouth.

39:48.971 --> 39:51.004
Now he dead,
and that's 'cause of what

39:51.006 --> 39:52.839
you did to my brother.

39:52.841 --> 39:54.875
You know it, too,
don't you?

39:54.877 --> 39:56.276
Quita.
Yeah. You know it.

39:57.780 --> 40:01.782
Your son shot dead off
in the damn bathroom.

40:03.152 --> 40:05.051
At least with me
he was alive.

40:06.755 --> 40:07.821
I'm telling you --

40:07.823 --> 40:14.261
[ cheering ]

40:16.331 --> 40:17.798
<i> Next on "the haves</i>
<i> and the have nots"...</i>

40:17.800 --> 40:19.666
Ms. young.
What?

40:19.668 --> 40:21.301
I want to talk to you
about Quincy Maxwell.

40:21.303 --> 40:22.803
You don't have
a very good poker face.

40:22.805 --> 40:24.204
What do you mean?

40:24.206 --> 40:25.472
He'll know that you're
in love with him.

40:25.474 --> 40:28.275
What are you doing?
I'm taking off your shoes, sir.

40:28.277 --> 40:29.209
I got them.

40:29.211 --> 40:30.043
Quita Maxwell?

40:30.045 --> 40:31.344
Who the hell is you?

40:31.346 --> 40:32.379
You have something
that I need.

40:32.381 --> 40:33.880
You spoke to me back
in napricia port.

40:33.882 --> 40:35.415
About the ATM issue.

40:35.417 --> 40:37.117
I might give you
another grand.

40:37.119 --> 40:39.319
Oh, and let me get
your cellphone.

40:39.321 --> 40:41.354
Where's my money?

40:41.356 --> 40:43.490
I want to do it now.

40:43.492 --> 40:44.991
Where is Veronica?

40:44.993 --> 40:46.426
I'll show you.
