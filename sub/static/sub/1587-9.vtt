lt's over.

44:19.741 --> 44:20.741
Let it end.

44:21.576 --> 44:22.909
This is how a man ends.

(GROANS)

44:31.419 --> 44:32.419
Put him in chains.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.464
We'll question him later.

44:38.551 --> 44:40.886
l should have thrown you

44:40.970 --> 44:44.014
from the top of the Wall, boy!

44:44.098 --> 44:45.474
Aye.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.435
You should have.

JON: For one night.

45:22.261 --> 45:24.596
This is a great victory.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.723
A great victory?

45:28.434 --> 45:32.396
Mance was testing our defences.
He almost made it through.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.190
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

45:35.274 --> 45:37.859
He has 1 ,000 times as many men.

45:41.364 --> 45:44.032
They'll hit us again tonight.

45:44.117 --> 45:47.869
Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two,
but we'll never beat them.

45:49.038 --> 45:50.414
Where are we going?

45:50.498 --> 45:52.249
Going to find Mance.

45:53.543 --> 45:54.835
You can't do that.

45:55.002 --> 45:56.753
No one gave you any orders.

45:58.339 --> 45:59.756
Who's left to give orders?

46:00.967 --> 46:03.593
The wildling army's only an army
because of Mance.

46:04.345 --> 46:06.763
He united 1 00 warring tribes.

46:06.848 --> 46:08.390
Without Mance, they lose their leader.

46:08.933 --> 46:11.309
They lose their purpose.
They go back to fighting each other.

46:11.394 --> 46:12.894
Scatter back to their homes.

46:13.396 --> 46:15.522
Without Mance?

46:15.606 --> 46:16.606
You're going to kill him?

46:16.691 --> 46:17.858
l'm gonna try.

46:17.942 --> 46:20.110
They'll never let you within 1 00 yards of him.

46:20.194 --> 46:22.237
And even if they did,
even if you managed to kill him...

46:22.321 --> 46:24.698
They'll kill me?
lf l don't go, they'll kill me anyway.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.324
They'll kill the rest of us, too.

46:26.409 --> 46:28.034
SAMWELL: They won't just kill you.

46:28.786 --> 46:32.038
They'll boil you, flay you, make it last days.

46:35.084 --> 46:38.336
You're right. lt's a bad plan.

46:40.882 --> 46:42.591
What's your plan?

47:26.177 --> 47:28.261
They held the gate.

47:37.563 --> 47:39.940
Get some brothers down here to help you.

47:42.193 --> 47:44.069
We need to burn the bodies.

48:05.550 --> 48:07.467
Raise the outer gate.

48:08.177 --> 48:10.595
Then lower it again as soon as l'm out.
