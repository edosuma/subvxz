WEBVTT

00:15.933 --> 00:16.975
Oh, no!

00:18.519 --> 00:20.270
Were you just barking?

00:20.771 --> 00:21.772
No.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.191
How long was I out?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.734
I don't know.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.945
You were in the zone, so I left.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.405
I figured one of us
should get decent sleep.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.448
Well, at least you brought me breakfast.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.077
This is mine. It's prescription.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.329
A prescription bagel?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.831
Legally, you're actually not allowed
to ask me about it.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.543
Whatever. I fixed the white noise bug.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.211
I'm gonna go home and take a shower.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.421
I have a lunch today,
and I can't go like this.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.048
You've got a lunch?

00:48.549 --> 00:51.426
Yes, Michelle, I can have a lunch.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.386
Hey, Poppy?

00:52.970 --> 00:53.971
Yeah, what's up?

00:54.638 --> 00:55.806
You...

00:56.557 --> 00:57.933
Zachariah.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.310
-Zachariah?
-It's Paul.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.105
What's up, Paul?

01:04.188 --> 01:05.774
I think we've got a problem.

01:06.316 --> 01:10.195
-Is it important?
-Yeah, actually, it's the Masked Man.

01:10.279 --> 01:14.950
So, he's handing out thousands of dollars
of free loot every minute.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.911
So far we've lost about $300,000.

01:19.538 --> 01:20.831
Is that bad?

01:22.040 --> 01:24.668
Yeah. That's bad, Zach.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.836
Sorry. It's Paul.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.045
I don't care.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.767
So...

01:40.851 --> 01:42.060
this is bad?

01:42.144 --> 01:44.521
Yes, this is bad.
How does nobody know this is bad?

01:44.605 --> 01:47.774
It's bad.
He's spewing up loot like a busted ATM.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.277
He just gave away a horse.
Those are expensive.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.403
Okay, this is bad.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.487
I'll go loop in Ian.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.489
No, no, no, you don't need to tell Ian.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.409
He'll just freak out and hold it
over my head for the rest of forever.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.204
-All right. Fine. I'll loop in Brad.
-No! Don't tell him either.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.497
This is a closed loop.
You don't need to call a meeting

02:02.581 --> 02:04.625
and get the entire company
involved in every decision.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.585
But I rule by committee.
That's my strength.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.752
No, David, that's your weakness.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.964
No. My weakness is my shoulders.
You know this.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.842
Can you please let go of my arms?
I can't escape your grasp.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.511
You know what a strong leader does?

02:15.594 --> 02:18.305
He puts out the small fires
before anyone even knows about them.

02:18.388 --> 02:22.267
He doesn't call in the entire fire
department because a trash can is burning.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.145
Well, if you had a trash can fire, you're
gonna want the entire fire department--

02:25.229 --> 02:27.272
Let's just keep it simple.
I'm gonna fix the bug,

02:27.356 --> 02:29.441
you stop the Masked Man
from giving away any more loot.

02:29.525 --> 02:30.984
Me? What do I do?

02:31.068 --> 02:34.696
I figured out that he can't give away
loot if you're hitting him. So, sit here,

02:34.780 --> 02:37.074
follow him around,
and bash him until I can fix it.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.619
It's that button. Trust me, we got this.
It's no big deal.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.455
If it's no big deal, then why is your neck
covered in stress hives?

02:43.539 --> 02:46.458
These? No, I get these all the time.
They could be from anything.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.418
No. That's from stress.
Absolutely. I know.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.672
I was covered in them during my
divorce proceedings. It wasn't my fault.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.549
-I mean, my wife, she's--
-David.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.469
Fine. Look. I won't loop in Ian on this,
but he's gonna find out.

02:57.553 --> 03:01.265
-The second he sits down at his computer.
-Don't worry about Ian. I got a plan.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.020
-Morning, gentlemen.
-Morning, Ian.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.106
-Hey. How you doing?
-Good morning.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.399
Good to see you, everybody.

03:11.024 --> 03:11.984
All right.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.111
-Maria!
-Ian.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.988
-Hola.
-Hola. ¿Cómo estás?

03:16.071 --> 03:17.239
Muy bien. ¿Y usted?

03:17.322 --> 03:20.200
-Muy bien, gracias. ¿Qué me cuentas?
-Tengo café.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.077
-Okay. Qué bueno. Me alegro mucho.
-Okay.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.787
-Okay. Chao, chao.
-Okay.

03:23.871 --> 03:24.872
Hey, Ian.

03:24.955 --> 03:28.542
-Hey, Pop. I was just talking to Maria.
-Cool.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.836
Yeah. In Spanish.
I don't know if you caught that.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.129
-What?
-I speak Spanish.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.548
-Yeah, great. I--
-Ah, g'day.

03:35.591 --> 03:36.592
Okay.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.302
That's Australian.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.513
Sure. There's someone
I want you to meet, just over here.

03:41.597 --> 03:44.683
This is Paul, our new gameplay programmer.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.477
-Paul, this is Ian.
-Hello, Paul. Welcome to the team.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.772
Hello. It's such a pleasure to be here.

03:55.611 --> 03:56.612
Yeah.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.488
Cool. Great.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.324
Nice to meet you. Welcome...

04:01.366 --> 04:04.661
Welcome. You can go ahead and sit down.
Let's get back to work, everyone.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.456
I have a surprise for you, Paul.
I heard that you have a bad back,

04:07.539 --> 04:09.082
-so I got you a standing desk.
-Wow.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.628
Thank you. That's great.
It's really exciting to be here, you know.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.463
I'm a huge fan of your work, Ian.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.882
I used to go on your blog a lot
back in the old days.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.551
You know, to gain a bit
of inspiration and just a big fan...

04:23.639 --> 04:25.307
-He's a big fan.
-Yeah.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.392
It's a pleasure to have you.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.438
"Big fan." Okay, great.

04:32.523 --> 04:33.565
Back to work.

04:33.649 --> 04:36.026
-Back to work, everybody. Yeah.
-Okay.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.694
-Great job, Paul.
-Thanks.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.779
Great.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.740
Great, great, great.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.075
Great, great, great.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.409
Great.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.138
Oh, my God!

05:06.223 --> 05:07.516
Wyld_D.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.977
Yo, what up, y'all?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.896
This is Wyld_Danimal coming at ya.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.024
I'm a streaming noob,
but I'm an OG gamer,

05:16.108 --> 05:19.570
so subscribe
for all of the red-hot MQ action.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.323
C.W.'s in the shot.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.034
Well, I don't know where the camera is.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.911
How can you not see it?
It's right here.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.831
-Does it pick up this?
-Oh, God.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.333
And that's a cut.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.794
Thank you for that, C.W.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.214
Come on, we talked about this, buddy.
You gotta be quiet, okay?

05:39.298 --> 05:40.883
And, Dana, maybe be less quiet.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.718
This is supposed to get people excited
about your channel,

05:42.801 --> 05:45.304
so maybe don't act
like you're in a basement in Kabul.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.388
Give me a giggle.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.348
-I don't really giggle.
-Try it out.

05:48.432 --> 05:49.933
C.W., let's go. Zip it up.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.061
Find somewhere else
to peddle your digital smut.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.189
Hey.
We gotta keep this operation under wraps.

05:55.731 --> 05:59.943
I refuse to write another word
until this office is restored.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.157
That's too bad because I was just about
to ask you to join the stream team.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.535
Maybe write Dana a little backstory.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.289
"Backstory"?

06:13.999 --> 06:15.334
-Go on.
-Yeah.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.753
That'd be great.
I love your cutscenes, C.W.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.129
No.

06:20.047 --> 06:24.426
Your flattery is nothing more
than a siren song...

06:24.843 --> 06:29.556
meant to lure me in
and then dash me upon the rocks.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.685
I shall not listen, lest I fall prey
to your beautiful poison tongue.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.440
I don't really like
when he talks about my tongue.

06:38.524 --> 06:39.900
Yeah. It's not great.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.453
Close the door.
Can't see with the glare on the screen.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.580
Sorry, who are you?

06:53.872 --> 06:56.500
I'm Lou. They brought me up
from the third-floor tester pool.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.961
Replaced some chick
who quit or died or something.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.256
Her name is Dana,
and you can't replace her.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.175
Sure she was a saint, God rest her soul.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.886
Anyway, upshot is I'm up here from now on.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.596
Okay...

07:12.599 --> 07:15.561
You know what? Let's maybe not
talk for the rest of the day.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.689
I'm kinda chomping at the bit
to test out these new maps.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.399
So...

07:21.483 --> 07:22.651
It's actually "champing."

07:23.777 --> 07:24.778
Sorry, what?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.655
You said "chomping at the bit."

07:26.738 --> 07:28.657
It's actually "champing at the bit."

07:29.950 --> 07:31.827
Don't worry about it.
It's a common mistake.

07:32.995 --> 07:33.996
Okay. Thanks, Lou.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.086
Let it be known,

07:41.712 --> 07:44.965
if you take my office,
I will occupy yours in kind.

07:45.674 --> 07:49.970
In the '70s, I participated
in my fair share of sit-ins.

07:51.263 --> 07:54.183
I was once forcibly removed
from Jane Fonda's house.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.435
Sorry, what?

07:56.810 --> 08:00.022
Hey, C.W., man, Brad's not here,
so you're just bothering me.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.524
Okay? I'm trying to do my work,
so just let me focus.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.027
Why are you harming
the creation I helped define?

08:05.110 --> 08:07.112
I'm not harming him.
The Masked Man is an NPC.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.614
He's an automated character.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.532
He does what we program him to do.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.117
So, just let me do my work.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.745
Sitting in my chair, huh?

08:15.454 --> 08:17.497
What? You have taken my office, Brad.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.083
In retaliation, I have taken yours.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.294
It's a power move. I like that. Kudos.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.087
No hard feelings. I found a new writer.

08:29.927 --> 08:30.928
What the hell is that?

08:31.553 --> 08:32.679
This thing?

08:32.763 --> 08:36.350
It's an AI server that can spit out
a brand-new backstory for Dana.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.437
That's preposterous.
A computer cannot write a story, dear boy.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.481
It can. And you know what? It already has.

08:44.107 --> 08:47.569
See? Just took about three seconds.
You want to read it?

08:48.111 --> 08:49.446
Please,

08:49.530 --> 08:52.324
that monstrosity
isn't able to generate a story

08:52.407 --> 08:55.827
with the emotional resonance
of a Nebula Award-winning writer.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.539
David, this matter needs
your immediate attention.

08:58.622 --> 08:59.915
What? You guys, come on.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.377
I'm working over here.
Just you two figure it out yourselves.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.797
Sometimes a fireman has to grab a hose
and put out the fire alone.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.468
Okay, I'm gonna go give this backstory
to Dana while David plays with his hose.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.779
He's mocking you.

09:30.863 --> 09:33.657
His very presence emasculates you
in front of your entire staff.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.909
Do you see how they look at him?

09:35.993 --> 09:38.161
Jo, he's no threat to me.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.872
Sure, he's big, but...

09:39.955 --> 09:41.957
the big ones are always dumb.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.084
Trust me. Here, check this out.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.631
Hey, Paul, what's the last book you read?

09:49.715 --> 09:53.510
Eso sería Cien años de soledad
en su lengua materna.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.182
A Hundred Years of Solitude.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.267
Sorry,
I'm reading it in the original Spanish.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.144
I thought I heard you
talking to Maria earlier,

10:02.227 --> 10:03.687
-so I thought you--
-Cool.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.442
-I thought you spoke Spanish.
-I do speak Spanish. That wasn't Spanish.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.527
I'm pretty sure that was Spanish.

10:11.195 --> 10:13.197
If it was,
it was some kind of weird dialect.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.034
They have a lot of indigenous tribes,
and I think the locals...

10:17.117 --> 10:18.827
-Should I be taking notes?
-No.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.413
Don't write any of that down, Jo.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.790
Not a big deal, okay? Let's just move on.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.169
Ian, you must reclaim your alpha status.

10:27.503 --> 10:28.921
Fight him. Hand-to-hand.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.298
"Fight him"? Jo, please.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.718
I mean, yes, in my younger days
I would've fought him.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.886
And yes, I would've won,

10:35.969 --> 10:40.432
but this is a professional workplace
and we are adults, okay?

10:40.891 --> 10:42.100
I'm a modern man.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.393
"A modern man"?

10:43.477 --> 10:48.649
Ian, don't let Rachel and her
liberal agenda cloud your judgment.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.527
I'm not letting the liberal agenda
do anything.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.946
I don't even know who the fuck Rachel is.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.823
Now, if you will allow me,
I need to get back to work

10:56.907 --> 10:58.200
because I have a game to run

10:58.700 --> 11:01.078
and a culture to impact.

11:01.787 --> 11:02.788
Okay.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.323
Hey, what's up?

11:38.782 --> 11:42.286
Poppy, hey.
Whoa, your hives have gotten way worse.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.704
Really? Shit.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.164
Well, the Masked Man's
acting normal again.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.833
Your fix worked. See?

11:47.916 --> 11:49.126
Business as usual.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.919
What? No, no, that can't be right.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.839
I'm still working on the bug.
I haven't pushed anything live yet.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.258
Well, maybe the bug fixed itself.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.844
Bugs don't just fix themselves, David.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.804
You haven't told anyone yet, have you?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.432
No, I mean, C.W.'s here,
but I've got him sequestered. See?

12:04.349 --> 12:05.350
What?

12:06.268 --> 12:09.021
Nothing. He's squatting in my office.
It's a whole thing.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.022
Poppy?

12:10.105 --> 12:12.149
I have to go.
I just got to the lunch restaurant.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.233
"Lunch restaurant"?

12:14.193 --> 12:16.069
-Hi.
-Welcome.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.073
I'm excited to show you our studio
and perhaps your new home.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.034
-Awesome.
-All right.

12:29.291 --> 12:33.545
Well, think I'm gonna get some more
of those awesome snacks.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.339
Damn, you guys got it good up here.

12:38.217 --> 12:39.593
Yeah, we have it great,

12:39.927 --> 12:42.387
except that our higher-ups
never listen to us

12:42.471 --> 12:44.598
and everyone generally
treats us like shit.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.892
I guess when you're
coming from the third floor,

12:46.975 --> 12:48.894
it's a little easier
to check your privilege.

12:50.521 --> 12:51.897
My "privilege"?

12:52.356 --> 12:54.983
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to be a woman in gaming?

12:56.902 --> 12:58.195
You know what? Never mind.

12:59.321 --> 13:00.322
All right.

13:00.739 --> 13:01.823
Look...

13:01.907 --> 13:05.869
there's clearly a lot of tension
between us here,

13:05.953 --> 13:07.829
and we're working in close quarters, so...

13:08.830 --> 13:11.583
Why don't we just address this right now?

13:12.334 --> 13:14.711
-I don't want to have sex with you.
-What?

13:15.170 --> 13:17.673
I don't want to have sex with you, man.
I'm gay.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.425
No shit? Bet I could turn you.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.511
Fucking-- You know what, Lou? I'm done.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.889
I am done. You are obnoxious.
You are rude.

13:26.515 --> 13:27.474
I don't even--

13:27.558 --> 13:29.977
I could care less
what you have to say about anything.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.730
You couldn't care less. If you could
care less, then you do care a little.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.774
You motherfucking--

13:40.696 --> 13:43.991
All of our tech leads
and specialists are here.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.034
They work collaboratively,

13:46.702 --> 13:49.413
driving our technical agenda
for the next five years,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.331
you know, bleeding edge stuff.

13:51.415 --> 13:54.668
Not too shabby, Dan Williams.
But I'm gonna have to hold out judgment

13:54.751 --> 13:56.795
until I see
the creative director's office.

13:56.879 --> 14:00.549
That's right here.
We have an open office space plan here.

14:00.632 --> 14:01.800
-That desk?
-Yeah.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.635
Seems a little low.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.555
Shouldn't it be kind of higher up,
you know?

14:06.638 --> 14:09.391
So that the creative director
can lord over everyone else

14:09.474 --> 14:12.269
in, like, an unspoken display of power.

14:12.853 --> 14:13.937
Who would do that?

14:14.438 --> 14:16.356
Ian does that. Is that not a thing?

14:16.815 --> 14:17.774
No.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.029
Interesting.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.198
Hey! Pootie.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.658
How's this little piece of shit
treating you?

14:26.742 --> 14:29.661
Great. We love Pootie.
He helps promote our game.

14:30.329 --> 14:31.622
Why would you call him that?

14:31.955 --> 14:32.956
I don't know.

14:33.248 --> 14:36.293
That's just what we call him
at our studio.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.004
It does seem kind of weird
now out of context.

14:39.630 --> 14:40.881
Maybe because he's a child.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.258
Yeah, yeah. That's probably it.

14:43.926 --> 14:47.221
MQ sounds like an
interesting place to work.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.932
No, no, no, it's not all bad.

14:50.599 --> 14:54.811
You know, to be honest, when I called you,
I was feeling a little underappreciated.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.813
Look. Here's my quick pitch.

14:57.648 --> 15:02.027
We don't rely on egomaniacs
making risky moves.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.196
All of our creative decisions
are cross-checked

15:04.279 --> 15:06.907
with behavioral player simulation
to ensure success.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.117
We protect our creative here.

15:09.660 --> 15:10.869
If you join us,

15:10.953 --> 15:13.413
the only ego you'll have to contend with
is your own.

15:13.497 --> 15:14.540
Not Ian's.

15:14.623 --> 15:15.666
What?

15:16.458 --> 15:19.211
-Yeah, I know.
-You saved the best for last.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.214
-Let me walk you out.
-Cool.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.218
Not bad.

15:29.847 --> 15:32.558
Not bad at all.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.355
Jesus! Twit.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.191
Okay. It's been, like, 30 minutes.
I think we're in the clear.

15:41.275 --> 15:44.778
How can you sit there frittering away
your life while the machine...

15:45.445 --> 15:47.364
robs us of our livelihoods?

15:48.323 --> 15:51.285
You hear that, you mechanized abomination?

15:51.368 --> 15:52.703
I know your game.

15:52.786 --> 15:56.164
C.W.,
Brad showed me the backstory you wrote.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.419
I knew you were a good writer,
but this is incredible.

16:00.711 --> 16:03.505
That shit made me cry, man. Really.

16:03.589 --> 16:04.590
I didn't--

16:06.508 --> 16:07.885
You've already said enough.

16:12.723 --> 16:13.724
Is it true?

16:15.142 --> 16:17.769
Has a cold, calculating machine

16:17.853 --> 16:22.983
produced a story that can
stir the human spirit to such a degree?

16:23.901 --> 16:26.153
C.W., don't let Brad get in your head.
You know?

16:26.236 --> 16:27.696
You just gotta--

16:28.947 --> 16:30.115
I've been obliterated.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.200
As have I.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.746
No, C.W., the Masked Man killed me.
Something is very wrong.

16:35.829 --> 16:41.084
-It's not supposed to be able to do that.
-Maybe it's not an "it" anymore.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.505
We in the science-fiction milieu

16:44.588 --> 16:47.174
have been writing about events like this
for decades.

16:47.758 --> 16:51.512
We may be witnessing
the dawn of the machine revolution.

16:52.095 --> 16:55.057
Perhaps the Masked Man has come to life.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.476
No, it's a bug.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.394
Yeah, it's a really big bug,

16:59.478 --> 17:00.938
but Poppy will fix it, okay?

17:01.021 --> 17:01.980
David, David.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.316
It's the beginning
of the enslavement of mankind

17:04.397 --> 17:06.902
at the hands of our own technology!

17:10.989 --> 17:12.324
Jack Daniel's?

17:13.325 --> 17:14.451
Wild Turkey.

17:14.535 --> 17:17.246
Right. Yeah.
I'm just gonna give Poppy a quick jingle

17:17.329 --> 17:19.498
and see if we can sort this all out, okay?

17:23.335 --> 17:25.127
Crap! Straight to voice mail.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.798
How long does it take to eat
a tuna fish sandwich in a bathroom stall?

17:27.881 --> 17:29.800
See, this is exactly why
we need committees.

17:40.435 --> 17:44.481
Eight, nine... ten.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.066
Yes.

17:46.358 --> 17:48.652
Yes! That felt great. I mean...

17:49.403 --> 17:52.948
It really feels great to get a nice sweat,
you know, and that...

17:53.031 --> 17:55.993
really quiets those insecure voices,
you know? I feel better.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.494
I needed that too.

17:57.578 --> 18:00.539
What about you, Stretch? You wanna
get down here and do a couple of reps?

18:00.622 --> 18:02.332
No, you're all right.

18:02.416 --> 18:03.876
Gym's not really my scene.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.003
I'm not sure how we ended up in here.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.921
I thought you were gonna
give me a tour of the whole building.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.798
This is an integral part of the building.

18:09.882 --> 18:11.508
I try to encourage all the employees

18:11.592 --> 18:13.302
to make exercise
a daily part of their routine.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.012
It's good for creativity.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.806
Might be good for you too.
I mean, with that bad back of yours.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.892
You see, Paul, as you grow older--

18:19.975 --> 18:22.811
I actually injured my back when I was 21.

18:22.895 --> 18:25.314
Twenty-one? Must have
fallen down after your first beer?

18:26.481 --> 18:27.482
I'm just joshin' ya.

18:27.566 --> 18:32.154
No, an RPG hit our
armored personnel carrier outside Basra.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.991
Yeah. Punched a fist-sized
chunk of shrapnel into my spine.

18:37.326 --> 18:38.660
Fist size, you say?

18:38.744 --> 18:40.329
Ian also has a back injury.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.081
Yes, actually, I did...

18:43.165 --> 18:46.835
injure my back in a motorcycle accident.
I have a motorcycle.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.754
-Motorcycle. That's cool.
-Yeah.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.130
It tipped over at a stoplight.

18:50.214 --> 18:52.382
He doesn't need the specifics, Jo,
thank you.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.467
Thank you.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.052
How did it tip over?

18:55.552 --> 18:57.721
-Yeah--
-It has three wheels, so it's extra heavy.

18:58.597 --> 19:01.266
Yes, it's a trike, technically.

19:01.350 --> 19:04.436
-Not a motorcycle, but...
-Yeah. That's cool too.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.854
Ian looks like Criss Angel.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.441
-That's not what I'm going for, Jo.
-Really?

19:09.733 --> 19:12.027
-That is who it is.
-Yes, really.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.906
Well, look. Listen.
If your back's giving you trouble,

19:15.989 --> 19:18.575
I can still remember a few tips
from the old rehab days.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.702
-No, my back is...
-His back is fine.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.538
-It's fine. It's just a little bit...
-Here we go.

19:22.621 --> 19:24.122
-No, I think I'm good.
-Just hold your arms.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.207
Nah, he's good!

19:25.290 --> 19:27.125
All right, I've got you. Here we go,
you're all right. I've got you.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.711
-Nah!
-You're safe. There we go. Okay.

19:29.795 --> 19:30.671
He's good!

19:30.754 --> 19:33.257
You're all right. I've got you.
And... You feel anything?

19:33.841 --> 19:36.426
Yeah. There we go. All right.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.846
Now, how's that? Did that work?

19:40.180 --> 19:41.181
Yes.

19:41.807 --> 19:43.559
-That worked.
-Great!

19:46.186 --> 19:47.187
Cool.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.275
Yeah. Let's keep the tour going.

19:51.900 --> 19:52.901
Great.

20:04.538 --> 20:05.539
Brad?

20:06.123 --> 20:07.958
-Brad?
-Weird.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.461
-I have returned.
-What are you doing, bud?

20:11.545 --> 20:14.548
I'm showing our new writer to his office--
to his half-office.

20:14.631 --> 20:19.136
After all, if he's gonna replace me,
might as well have my office as well.

20:19.761 --> 20:24.266
It is a "he", isn't it?
Please, God, tell me it's a "he."

20:24.600 --> 20:25.601
No.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.188
It's an air conditioner.

20:34.276 --> 20:37.613
But it-- It wrote such beautiful prose.

20:38.447 --> 20:41.158
No. The story that I gave Dana
was some of your old writing.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.577
I took it from one of these books
over here.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.290
Yeah. Inside the Caves of Beneroth.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.210
You wrote this in the '80s.
How could you not remember this?

20:51.293 --> 20:55.506
Admittedly, the...
the '80s were also a bit of a blur.

20:55.589 --> 20:59.510
Okay. Whatever. Either way, you wrote it.

20:59.593 --> 21:04.473
So, the machine is undone!

21:05.015 --> 21:07.518
Man lives to fight another day!

21:09.353 --> 21:11.980
Yeah. Okay, so are you gonna join
the stream team or what?

21:12.064 --> 21:14.233
Because I'm not gonna be able
to pull this off without you.

21:14.316 --> 21:19.154
Yes, indeed. My prose shall flow
from her beautiful tongue.

21:19.863 --> 21:22.824
Okay. You gotta stop talking
about people's tongues.

21:22.908 --> 21:24.576
Loosen up, man.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.537
Yeah, whatever. Have fun writing.

21:27.246 --> 21:28.247
Okay.

21:30.707 --> 21:31.708
Watch this.

21:40.676 --> 21:42.636
Son of a bitch!

21:53.605 --> 21:57.943
Ian! Ian! Ian! Ian!

22:01.280 --> 22:02.531
What is happening?

22:03.448 --> 22:05.868
Hey, Pop.
We're just taking out a little aggression.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.703
Everything's under control.

22:07.786 --> 22:10.038
Come on, Ian! Yeah!

22:10.956 --> 22:12.457
David, what the hell is going on?

22:13.584 --> 22:17.588
Well, Brad tricked C.W. into believing
an air conditioner was an AI server,

22:17.671 --> 22:20.632
so now he's just taking out
his pent-up frustration on the AC unit.

22:22.342 --> 22:25.929
Ian was unable to emasculate
the giant programmer guy,

22:26.013 --> 22:28.557
so I guess he just decided
to pick a fight he could win.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.975
How could you let this happen?

22:30.058 --> 22:32.269
Look. It doesn't matter.
The problem got solved anyway, okay?

22:32.352 --> 22:35.355
Because about ten minutes ago,
the Masked Man disappeared.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.941
-Disappeared? What do you mean he--
-Yeah. I mean, poof. He's gone.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.860
Yeah.
I can't find him on any of the servers.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.820
No. That's impossible.

22:41.904 --> 22:44.448
Well, it's not ideal, but I think
it's a pretty good short-term solution.

22:44.531 --> 22:49.369
Of course you do!
Because this entire office is insane!

22:49.953 --> 22:53.957
This is supposed to be
a professional workplace full of adults!

22:54.041 --> 22:56.376
Okay, yes. Today is a little bit abnormal.

22:56.460 --> 22:59.880
Except it's not, is it?
This is just another Tuesday for us.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.841
You know, it was your idea
to distract Ian with Tall Paul.

23:02.925 --> 23:05.886
Yeah! I've gone insane too
because, up until today,

23:05.969 --> 23:08.388
I thought that this was normal!

23:09.264 --> 23:11.975
But it's not.
I have to grow up and be the adult

23:12.059 --> 23:14.811
and figure out what the hell is happening
with the Masked Man!

23:16.063 --> 23:18.065
-Hey, your hives are getting worse.
-You think?

23:18.774 --> 23:22.027
If the Masked Man has disappeared
from the game, then this isn't a glitch.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.612
Someone's messing with him.

23:23.695 --> 23:25.489
I'm just gonna go through the code logs.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.409
Wait a minute.

23:30.244 --> 23:33.038
This looks like the changes
didn't come from a verified log-in.

23:34.248 --> 23:35.290
Shit.

23:35.374 --> 23:36.750
They're external.

23:37.334 --> 23:38.460
What does that mean?

23:39.419 --> 23:41.171
It means we've been hacked.

23:43.549 --> 23:44.550
Oh, my God.

23:47.678 --> 23:50.097
-So what do I do?
-Fucking nothing, David! Nothing!

23:50.180 --> 23:53.183
I will deal with it. Okay? You do nothing.

23:53.892 --> 23:54.893
Jesus.

24:07.322 --> 24:08.323
Boop!

24:08.407 --> 24:10.075
Hey, Paul. How you doing?

24:10.576 --> 24:12.953
Don't know. Depends.
Are you going to try and fight me?

24:14.079 --> 24:15.247
I deserve that.

24:15.330 --> 24:18.458
No. I came to apologize, actually.

24:18.542 --> 24:19.543
Walk with me.

24:22.379 --> 24:26.258
Look, man. I try to think of myself
as an evolved human, but...

24:27.050 --> 24:32.055
I find myself in these patterns
of toxic masculinity and...

24:32.848 --> 24:34.224
honestly, it's just not cool.

24:34.308 --> 24:38.145
It's not your fault that I'm insecure
about your physicality...

24:39.271 --> 24:40.814
or that I'm threatened by...

24:40.898 --> 24:43.358
your war record, or, quite frankly,

24:43.442 --> 24:46.486
all of the things that make you
such an amazing man. So...

24:47.112 --> 24:48.113
I'm sorry.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.909
Wow, Ian, that's very noble of you.

24:51.992 --> 24:55.454
I really appreciate the gesture
and the apology. Thank you.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.624
The truth is,
I've been so impressed with you

24:58.707 --> 25:01.168
that I have given you a promotion.

25:02.002 --> 25:05.297
Wow. Thank you, Ian.
What does that mean?

25:05.756 --> 25:09.134
It means you get a new office.

25:09.218 --> 25:14.056
Yes. Down next to Sue,
our community manager.

25:14.139 --> 25:15.265
There's your new key card.

25:15.349 --> 25:18.101
Wow, Ian. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate this.

25:18.185 --> 25:20.312
Careful with that card.
It is a little bit finicky.

25:20.395 --> 25:23.982
But it will get you down to the basement
and keep you there forever.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.734
Sorry? Keep me there? I'm not sure--

25:27.903 --> 25:29.947
"Toxic masculinity," my ass.

25:30.364 --> 25:32.074
Fuck you, you big bitch.
