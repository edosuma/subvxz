[Japanese pop song
playing loudly over speakers]

01:36.166 --> 01:38.958
[man] You sure you don't wanna use
the variable scope for this?

01:39.041 --> 01:40.875
No. I've got a lock
on vector and trajectory.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.791
You ever hear that saying,
"Listen to your elders"?

01:45.875 --> 01:48.541
Big phrase, especially here in Japan.

01:48.625 --> 01:50.041
So you're an elder now?

01:50.916 --> 01:54.875
"Elder" doesn't necessarily mean old.
It just means older.

01:54.958 --> 01:56.500
As in smarter, wiser.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.125
But hey, I'm serious.
We blow this chance, it's seven years--

02:01.208 --> 02:03.625
Seven years of hard work down the drain.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.916
Ah, so you do listen to me.

02:08.666 --> 02:09.666
V…

02:10.750 --> 02:12.791
I haven't missed once in 12 years.

02:13.541 --> 02:14.583
Not gonna miss.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.500
All right. Let's dance.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.625
Oh, one last thing.

02:29.125 --> 02:32.416
See? And you say
I only think about the work.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.375
[bottle fizzes]

02:59.791 --> 03:01.000
[Kate] Hi, uh…

03:01.791 --> 03:04.583
[speaking Japanese]

03:09.500 --> 03:10.541
[in English] No.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.125
[speaking Japanese]

03:15.125 --> 03:16.416
[in English] Well, never mind, then.

03:17.208 --> 03:18.833
-Here, catch!

[woman over radio] Target visible.

04:00.083 --> 04:01.708
Seasonal, the window is open.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.000
You're green.

04:11.666 --> 04:12.958
I've got a protocol breach.

04:13.041 --> 04:14.291
[woman] I repeat, you are green.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.291
Code five on-site. Code five.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.000
[woman] Overridden. Take the shot.

04:19.083 --> 04:21.250
Hold on. There's a kid here.

04:22.166 --> 04:25.416
[woman] The window is closing.
I repeat, take the shot, Seasonal.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.333
Please reconfirm.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.083
[woman] I repeat, take the shot.

[music continues faintly over headphones]

06:16.208 --> 06:18.625
[indistinct conversation]

06:23.291 --> 06:25.125
[Kate] I've thought
about this a long time.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.041
I wanna talk retirement.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.875
[Varrick] What happened in Osaka
shouldn't have.

06:35.416 --> 06:36.583
It was wrong.

06:37.541 --> 06:39.458
-[thunder rumbles]
-[rain pattering]

06:39.541 --> 06:41.250
Nobody knew she'd be there.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.333
We had one rule, V.

06:45.166 --> 06:46.916
One simple rule. No kids.

06:47.000 --> 06:47.916
I know.

06:52.166 --> 06:53.750
I mean, this ain't your first rodeo.

06:53.833 --> 06:56.458
You know there's collateral damage.
You know that.

06:57.541 --> 06:58.708
I can't shake it.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.708
Trust me, I've tried.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.791
Almost to the head of the snake.

07:08.875 --> 07:11.291
Look, I promised
I'd finish the job, and I will.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.541
And then I'm out.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.458
I want a life, V.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.791
You know, I never had one.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.166
A real, regular life.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.458
What does that mean?

07:31.541 --> 07:33.625
I mean, what… Family? Kids?

07:34.250 --> 07:37.208
-Picket fence? Dogs? Suburbs?
-I don't know.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.541
Something like that.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.458
Two trips to Walmart, you'll be back.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.458
[crowd chattering indistinctly]

08:43.041 --> 08:44.458
[man] It must be killing you.

08:45.208 --> 08:47.083
You haven't even touched your Merlot.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.333
It's Margaux.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.125
I'm sorry, that was a total pick-up line.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.750
Fuck it. I mean, listen.

08:55.833 --> 08:58.416
The worst way
to start a conversation is a "Hey."

08:59.083 --> 09:01.791
It's boring, it's dull. It's for horses.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.916
So anything but that.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.166
I'm Stephen.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.333
-Hey.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.625
[Kate] Seasonal, on-site.

Stage mark. Northwest corner.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.833

11:10.041 --> 11:12.541
[woman] Main entrance, two black sedans.
Single.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.291

11:38.958 --> 11:40.000
Seasonal, report.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.458

Seasonal, report.

11:55.791 --> 11:57.625

13:23.666 --> 13:25.541
[rock music continues]

14:02.958 --> 14:05.208
[Varrick] Now you start
the rest of your life

14:06.500 --> 14:08.875
-What's your name?
-Kate.

14:08.958 --> 14:10.666
Kate. I'm Varrick.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.333
I'm your handler now.

14:13.416 --> 14:17.333
That makes me your mother,
your father, your best friend,

14:18.041 --> 14:19.125
and your therapist.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.875

Good.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.583
[footsteps echoing]

14:49.375 --> 14:50.958
[doctor] It's good. You're awake.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.083
You've been out almost a day.

14:54.708 --> 14:55.833
[whispers in Japanese]

14:58.500 --> 15:03.166
[in English] Have you had any recent
exposure to radioactive materials?

15:03.250 --> 15:04.166
No.

15:04.250 --> 15:09.958
The reason I ask is you appear to be
suffering from accelerated ARS.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.208
Acute radiation syndrome.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.291
Lethal.

15:15.375 --> 15:18.416
Caused by subjection
to potent radiation in…

15:19.291 --> 15:21.250
extremely short amount of time.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.458
Which substance?

15:24.541 --> 15:26.000
We looked for the usuals.

15:27.333 --> 15:30.458
Iodine-131, thallium, but uh…

15:32.041 --> 15:34.708
it appears to be more specific.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.041
Polonium-210?

15:39.208 --> 15:40.291
204.

15:46.208 --> 15:47.166
[inhales sharply]

15:47.250 --> 15:48.833
We'll take the Margaux to go.

15:54.958 --> 15:56.416
Please do not try to…

16:04.000 --> 16:05.500
How much time do I have?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.166
A day, maybe.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.416
-But we will make it painless for you.
-[scoffs]

16:12.916 --> 16:14.041
Shit.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.041
It's possible that--

16:22.333 --> 16:23.458
[doctor] I'll get a nurse.

Five liters of blood in the body,
heart pumps two a minute.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.625
Gun's on your femoral. You do the math.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.958
I need something to keep me going.

17:27.125 --> 17:28.708
I want stimulants.

17:28.791 --> 17:31.166
These. Load them in the shots, go.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.000
Give me five.

17:36.458 --> 17:37.750
-Come on.
-Okay.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.500
I don't have all the time in the world.

17:43.541 --> 17:44.666
What are you trying to do?

17:53.833 --> 17:55.833
[woman speaking Japanese on radio]

17:56.875 --> 18:00.666
[whispering] Shibuya-ku Sendagaya.
Shibuya-ku Sendagaya.

[Stephen speaking indistinctly]

18:07.291 --> 18:10.166
-[woman] …take a shower.
-[Stephen] We should just have fun!

18:10.666 --> 18:12.666
-[Stephen] It's the last night. Come on!
-I know.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.208
But I still have stuff to do.

18:16.916 --> 18:18.916
-Oh, my God! [gasps]
-[Stephen groaning]

18:19.791 --> 18:20.958
[speaking Japanese]

18:22.791 --> 18:24.041
[in English] Why'd you poison me?

18:25.166 --> 18:26.916
What are you talking about? Poison?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.833
[hesitates] I didn't know it was…

18:28.916 --> 18:32.291
They told me it was just a roofie,
so they could lift the room.

18:32.375 --> 18:33.458
Who? Who told you?

18:34.416 --> 18:36.416
Even if I knew, I'd be dead if I tell you.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.541
-Aw, she'll be dead if you don't.
-Wait.

18:40.458 --> 18:41.500
Don't.

18:42.166 --> 18:43.000
[Stephen sighs]

18:44.458 --> 18:45.708
Sato.

18:47.166 --> 18:50.041
Kazuo Sato. He manages a Yakuza club.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.125
Which clan?

18:51.708 --> 18:52.583
Kijima.

18:53.708 --> 18:56.250
Fuck, it's a Kijima clan.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.583
[woman] They've owned us for years.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.875
Sato said that
if he did this one last thing,

19:00.958 --> 19:02.291
that he would set us free.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.958
We could actually start over now.

19:06.166 --> 19:07.333
A different life.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Please.

19:33.083 --> 19:35.208
[spits, coughs]

19:49.500 --> 19:50.791
These might fit you.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.041
Can I get you something?

19:56.291 --> 19:57.500
Anything?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.208
Boom Boom Lemon?

20:07.208 --> 20:08.458
You got any?

20:10.750 --> 20:11.750
Oh, um…

20:12.500 --> 20:14.291
No, sorry.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.041
I'm Kanako.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.958
And it seems we're the same.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.333
Collateral damage.

20:36.583 --> 20:37.666
I'm Kate.

20:39.916 --> 20:41.625
And they're gonna know I was here.

20:42.708 --> 20:43.833
Who?

20:46.500 --> 20:47.708
Everyone.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.666
[tense music playing]

20:58.291 --> 20:59.500
Poisoned by who?

20:59.583 --> 21:01.500
[Kate] That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

21:04.708 --> 21:06.708
There must be some antidote.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.375
For polonium-204?

21:28.458 --> 21:29.958
Who was the mark, V?

21:31.833 --> 21:33.291
Kate, you know, uh…

21:35.916 --> 21:36.916
V?

21:38.291 --> 21:39.416
Who was the mark?

21:48.041 --> 21:50.666
You won't get any more
questions from me after today.

21:55.708 --> 21:57.333
A man named Kijima.

21:58.458 --> 22:00.000
I recognized him from Osaka.

22:01.166 --> 22:02.083
Who is he?

22:02.166 --> 22:05.583
Grand honcho
of the biggest family in Tokyo.

22:06.375 --> 22:10.375
Your mark in Osaka
was Kijima's younger brother, Kentaro.

22:12.625 --> 22:13.583
-[gunshot]
-[blood splatters]

22:14.458 --> 22:19.333
[sighs] I won't lie, it's been a shitshow
for us as it's been for you, and…

22:20.208 --> 22:24.458
[clears throat] Kijima, apparently,
who hasn't been able to let it go.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.375
This was revenge for Osaka?

22:27.458 --> 22:31.416
Some people have this extraordinary
attachment to their siblings,

22:31.500 --> 22:35.125
as if genetics make a family and…

22:38.666 --> 22:43.416
Anyway, all that honor shit,
Kijima's been on a tear against the…

22:44.208 --> 22:45.333
[Kate sniffles]

22:46.500 --> 22:47.375
How do I get to him?

I lost someone that I love a lot.

1:10:34.666 --> 1:10:35.666
And you know her.

1:10:39.208 --> 1:10:40.208
Kate?

1:10:43.083 --> 1:10:44.500
Maybe my best friend.

1:10:45.416 --> 1:10:46.416
And, uh…

1:10:49.958 --> 1:10:51.875
I'm very worried about her.

1:10:51.958 --> 1:10:53.458
[scoffs] "Friends."

1:10:54.291 --> 1:10:56.625
I didn't know Kate had any stupid friends.

1:10:57.208 --> 1:10:58.875
Well, she's got you, doesn't she?

1:11:00.458 --> 1:11:02.500
But you're right.

1:11:02.583 --> 1:11:06.583
She and I
aren't really friends, more family.

1:11:08.875 --> 1:11:09.833
[Kijima speaking Japanese]

1:11:25.666 --> 1:11:27.416

1:11:48.583 --> 1:11:51.041
[Kate gasps and chokes]

1:12:05.416 --> 1:12:11.666
[in English] Have you ever wondered
about Kate's obsession with your family?

1:12:12.791 --> 1:12:14.666
You mean my uncle?

1:12:16.208 --> 1:12:18.125
Yeah, sure. Him, too.

1:12:20.416 --> 1:12:21.416
Sorry.

1:12:23.166 --> 1:12:26.375
I know you've been through a lot.

1:12:27.875 --> 1:12:29.000
What do you mean?

1:12:30.708 --> 1:12:37.666
Kate ever share with you what she did
in Osaka when she first met you?

1:12:39.958 --> 1:12:40.916
[speaking Japanese]

1:13:01.916 --> 1:13:04.250
[gagging and struggling to breathe]

1:13:09.083 --> 1:13:10.458
[in English] I have to finish this.

1:13:12.416 --> 1:13:15.416
I'm dying. I have to finish…
I have to finish something.

1:13:18.166 --> 1:13:21.791
[in English]
Death is the time for the beginnings.

[in English] No, no, no.

1:14:17.291 --> 1:14:19.125
No, Ani. Ani, no…

1:14:19.208 --> 1:14:21.083
[Ani] You lied to me!

1:14:21.166 --> 1:14:23.708
[stammering] I killed someone for you.

1:14:24.875 --> 1:14:27.375
-Ani--
-You killed my whole family.

1:14:28.333 --> 1:14:29.833
You… You bitch!

1:14:29.916 --> 1:14:31.166
No, please.

1:14:31.250 --> 1:14:33.875
Shoot me if you want,
but don't get in that car, okay?

1:14:34.458 --> 1:14:36.208
Look at me. I'm begging you.

1:14:38.166 --> 1:14:41.125
You're stronger than I am.
You don't have to end up here--

1:14:41.208 --> 1:14:44.791
Shut the fuck up!
I have nothing left, okay?

1:14:45.875 --> 1:14:48.458
It's what they do.
You and me, we're collateral--

[ominous music playing]

1:15:37.291 --> 1:15:39.166
[Varrick] You start the rest of your life.

1:15:40.458 --> 1:15:43.916
I know how much you must be
hurting right now, losing your parents.

1:15:45.375 --> 1:15:46.625
But it's gonna be okay.

I know.

1:15:57.833 --> 1:16:00.875
Shoot 'em in the stomach,
they die slow, in agony.

1:16:00.958 --> 1:16:03.333
And they know it's personal.

-Breathe.

1:16:07.333 --> 1:16:08.250
Breathe.

1:16:08.333 --> 1:16:10.833
[Varrick] Are you gonna
let that pain overwhelm you?

1:16:13.833 --> 1:16:15.625
-Control you?
-[groans]

1:16:16.583 --> 1:16:18.041
[Ani] This is so cool.

1:16:20.458 --> 1:16:22.208
Maybe you can embrace it.

1:16:23.416 --> 1:16:25.583

1:17:32.416 --> 1:17:33.333
Renji?

1:17:33.416 --> 1:17:35.333
[in English] What is she doing here?

1:17:36.625 --> 1:17:39.166
She's the future. Mine at least.

1:17:40.083 --> 1:17:41.083
Ani, sit.

1:17:49.166 --> 1:17:52.958
You went after my girl
without my permission.

1:17:53.750 --> 1:17:56.083
I could fucking kill you right now.

1:17:58.416 --> 1:18:00.625
And destroy your own operation?

1:18:00.708 --> 1:18:03.916
My issue is not with my operation.

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.916
It's with you taking it on yourself.

1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.125
You ordered her termination.

1:18:09.875 --> 1:18:12.666
"If she's leaving, I will terminate her."

1:18:12.750 --> 1:18:15.125
Your words exactly.

1:18:19.208 --> 1:18:20.208
"If."

1:18:20.916 --> 1:18:21.958
I said "if."

[Renji] Your girl had to die.

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:59.416
That was always the deal, Varrick-san.

1:19:00.083 --> 1:19:03.125
After Kentaro's death,
all eyes were on me.

1:19:03.708 --> 1:19:07.541

I moved too quickly, and I'm sorry.

Maybe we do our best
to put this behind us.

1:19:37.500 --> 1:19:39.333
In the name of being human.

1:19:40.583 --> 1:19:42.083
I prefer self-interest.

1:19:43.041 --> 1:19:44.458
I trust it more.

1:19:48.875 --> 1:19:51.750

we'll hole up in there. Move!

I'd take it all back. I'm so sorry.

who we are now.

And you know, Kate, that we are…

Well, I was gonna say
"indispensable parts of a system."

That you created and controlled.

1:31:25.208 --> 1:31:27.208

Don't do this, Varrick.
