00:13.391 --> 00:15.859
US military escort CDC Team

00:15.893 --> 00:19.129
requesting permission
to enter Egyptian airspace.

00:19.163 --> 00:21.465
Permission granted.

00:21.499 --> 00:24.001
Dr. Scott, on to the right.
Take a look.

00:24.035 --> 00:25.469
He's on approach.

00:25.503 --> 00:28.905
Visibility-- good.
Time to target-- three minutes.

00:28.940 --> 00:30.107
Roger that. 2-2-0.

00:30.141 --> 00:31.408
Roger that. I see it.

00:31.476 --> 00:33.543
Status-- green.

00:33.578 --> 00:37.247
Dr. Scott,
prepare for landing.

00:37.315 --> 00:39.249
Putting down close to...

00:39.283 --> 00:41.184
20 feet.

00:41.219 --> 00:43.653
10 feet.

00:43.721 --> 00:46.523
And we're down.

00:46.557 --> 00:48.158
Doctor,
you've got five minutes.

00:54.699 --> 00:56.166
This way.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.536
There are 6,000 quarantined
in this camp.

00:59.570 --> 01:00.904
We have 387 dead.

01:00.938 --> 01:02.406
My staff is down to six!

01:02.440 --> 01:04.373
I thought you were bringing
more doctors with you.

01:10.415 --> 01:13.216
These are the latest
to come down with the virus.

01:13.251 --> 01:15.986
Once the spots come,
they die in two days.

01:44.515 --> 01:46.183
I'm sorry.

01:59.564 --> 02:03.812
_

02:11.375 --> 02:14.044
Make sure those snowmobiles
go to starboard Hangar F!

02:14.078 --> 02:17.214
Chief Spurling, Chief Lewis, we
are getting under way at 1300.

02:17.248 --> 02:18.715
Let's pick up the pace, okay?!

02:18.783 --> 02:21.351
Yeah, I know all about
the Naval Mountain Warfare Unit,

02:21.385 --> 02:24.254
but I've never heard of a dog
setting foot on a destroyer.

02:24.288 --> 02:26.523
This isn't just a dog.
This is Admiral Halsey.

02:26.557 --> 02:27.991
And he's a mean operator.

02:28.025 --> 02:29.426
Yeah?
Well, so is the Captain.

02:46.310 --> 02:48.478
You can just
put that down over there.

02:50.314 --> 02:53.717
Be careful.
That's delicate equipment.

02:53.751 --> 02:56.153
I take it
you're my new houseguest.

02:56.187 --> 02:58.522
I'm Commander Chandler,
ship's Captain.

02:58.556 --> 03:00.323
Rachel Scott.

03:00.358 --> 03:02.159
I'm sorry we had to take over
your helicopter bay,

03:02.193 --> 03:04.494
but it was the only space large
enough to accommodate our lab.

03:06.397 --> 03:09.065
I got 217 men and women
on this ship.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.501
Anything
I should be concerned about?

03:11.536 --> 03:13.170
Oh, this?

03:13.237 --> 03:15.705
Um, this is just so
we don't contaminate the work...

03:15.740 --> 03:19.142
Not the other way around.

03:19.177 --> 03:22.045
What exactly are you gonna
be studying up there?

03:22.079 --> 03:23.013
Birds.

03:23.047 --> 03:24.447
Birds?

03:24.482 --> 03:27.184
We are virologists--

03:27.218 --> 03:30.320
tracking obscure microbes
in hard-to-get-to places.

03:30.354 --> 03:32.622
Pretty boring stuff, actually.

03:32.657 --> 03:36.726
We really do appreciate your
assistance, Captain Chandler.

03:36.761 --> 03:39.129
We're here to serve.

03:40.531 --> 03:41.798
Welcome aboard, Doctor.

03:57.765 --> 04:00.595
_

04:01.341 --> 04:05.305
_

04:12.530 --> 04:14.331
Roger that. Red Deck.

04:14.365 --> 04:17.100
Bird's chocked and chained,
heading to the barn.

04:17.134 --> 04:19.236
Damn, it's cold.
I can't feel my face.

04:19.269 --> 04:20.803
Lieutenant Granderson,
tell me--

04:20.870 --> 04:22.172
do I still have my face?

04:22.206 --> 04:23.673
Yes, sir, though it looks like

04:23.708 --> 04:25.508
you could use some lip balm,
sir.

04:25.543 --> 04:27.510
Should've taken
that desk job in Miami.

04:27.545 --> 04:29.646
It is cold!

04:45.830 --> 04:47.664
Captain's on the bridge!

04:47.698 --> 04:49.666
XO Slattery,

04:49.700 --> 04:52.769
let's see if we can get
your frozen ass back to Norfolk.

04:54.505 --> 04:56.273
- TAO, Bridge.
- Bridge, TAO.

04:56.340 --> 04:59.142
Our Helo just dropped a target
for our final missile test.

04:59.176 --> 05:01.511
Target's five feet long,
two feet wide,

05:01.545 --> 05:04.381
and in the icy water
has no heat signature.

05:04.415 --> 05:06.082
Let's find it and kill it.

05:06.117 --> 05:07.751
Scanning for target.

05:07.785 --> 05:08.785
Scanning zone.

05:08.819 --> 05:10.620
Kill track 5205.

05:10.655 --> 05:12.689
- Target acquired.
- Target acquired. Break.

05:12.723 --> 05:15.191
Kill track 0845, aye.

05:15.226 --> 05:17.227
MSS, kill track 0845.

05:17.261 --> 05:18.561
Missile ready to fire.

05:20.698 --> 05:22.399
- Missile clear.
- 2-2-0, 30.

05:22.466 --> 05:24.434
30,000.

05:32.576 --> 05:33.576
_

05:33.577 --> 05:36.780
- Boom.
- Target confirmed kill.

05:36.814 --> 05:40.450
Good afternoon,<i> Nathan James.</i>
This is the Captain.

05:40.484 --> 05:43.553
After four very challenging
months at the top of the world,

05:43.587 --> 05:45.722
we have just passed
our final test,

05:45.756 --> 05:47.924
and I'm proud to say
you did it with flying colors.

05:47.958 --> 05:50.860
I'm asking the Pentagon if
we can break radio silence today

05:50.895 --> 05:53.430
and make calls and e-mail.

05:53.464 --> 05:55.699
Bravo Zulu
to each and every one of you.

05:55.766 --> 05:58.735
Enjoy your success,
'cause we're going home.

06:07.345 --> 06:10.547
Gonna drop to 50 below.
Get them off the ice.

06:10.581 --> 06:11.915
Aye, sir.

06:11.949 --> 06:14.818
Dr. Scott, come in.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.519
Dr. Scott, are you there?

06:16.587 --> 06:17.854
Please respond.

06:17.888 --> 06:19.689
Dr. Scott, come in.

06:26.931 --> 06:28.665
You have got to be kidding me.

06:30.668 --> 06:32.535
We're so close.
We need to make sure

06:32.570 --> 06:35.338
the isolate isn't contaminated.
We need more samples.

06:35.406 --> 06:37.607
It's all right, Rachel.
We can come back tomorrow.

06:39.810 --> 06:42.278
Ma'am, we've been
trying to reach you.

06:42.346 --> 06:44.447
CO wants you back on the ship.

06:44.482 --> 06:47.851
You can tell the Captain
that I'll return when I'm ready.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.753
It wasn't an invitation, ma'am.

06:49.787 --> 06:53.590
Right now.
Captain's orders.

06:53.624 --> 06:56.726
Landing check is complete.
Gear down and locked.

06:56.794 --> 06:58.828
20 feet.

06:58.863 --> 07:01.364
10 feet.

07:01.399 --> 07:02.766
Wheels down.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.841
We haul ass from here, we can
make it back for the Series.

07:11.876 --> 07:13.843
You don't really think
The Cubs are still in it.

07:13.878 --> 07:15.879
It's the weakest division
in baseball.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.714
We were six games up
when we left.

07:17.748 --> 07:19.749
Yeah, that was June.
And they're The Cubs.

07:19.817 --> 07:24.487
Captain Chandler, you had no
right to pull me from my work.

07:24.522 --> 07:26.489
I'm gonna go check on the,
uh... Yeah.

07:26.524 --> 07:28.858
Those men are here
to support me.

07:28.893 --> 07:32.295
- You don't send them to bring me in.
- Those men are sailors in the US Navy

07:32.329 --> 07:33.963
- and report directly to me.
- I say when I am done and ready.

07:33.998 --> 07:35.565
My work is vital here,
and I have finally found

07:35.599 --> 07:36.933
- what I'm looking for!
- Doctor!

07:38.702 --> 07:40.837
First of all,
thanks for checking in.

07:40.871 --> 07:43.640
Think this is the first time
you said more than three words

07:43.674 --> 07:45.442
to me since we left Norfolk.

07:45.476 --> 07:47.744
Well, I am sorry that
I haven't had you over for tea.

07:47.812 --> 07:49.546
You know, your attitude
was mildly charming

07:49.613 --> 07:52.782
back in June in Virginia,
but up here, at 50 below,

07:52.817 --> 07:56.419
when none of us have talked
to our families in four months,

07:56.454 --> 07:57.720
not so charming.

07:57.755 --> 07:59.022
Yeah, well, charm
wasn't exactly my prio--

07:59.056 --> 08:00.824
Still talking.

08:00.858 --> 08:03.393
Now, I think I've been
more than a gracious host--

08:03.427 --> 08:05.595
taxied you and your assistant
around the islands here

08:05.629 --> 08:07.263
so you could chase after
your ducks.

08:07.298 --> 08:09.399
- Arctic terns.
- You need to wrap it up.

08:09.433 --> 08:11.401
Our mission's done,
and we'll be heading back.

08:13.571 --> 08:15.605
I'll take a rain check
on the tea.

08:22.546 --> 08:23.746
Benzo, eat some fruit.

08:23.814 --> 08:25.582
Oh!

08:25.649 --> 08:27.517
Come on, Mr. Chung. It's our
last night at the North Pole.

08:27.551 --> 08:28.952
Look, I know
you've got big plans,

08:28.986 --> 08:30.820
but don't you ever get your head
out of that book?

08:30.855 --> 08:31.721
Nope.

08:32.756 --> 08:33.722
Okay.

08:37.628 --> 08:38.660
Lieutenant.

08:38.696 --> 08:39.895
Lieutenant.

08:49.707 --> 08:51.441
Danny, whoa.

08:52.676 --> 08:54.511
Don't do that.

08:54.545 --> 08:55.845
Do what?

08:55.880 --> 08:57.647
You know
what that smile does to me.

08:57.681 --> 08:59.015
All's fair in love and war.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.818
Yeah.

09:01.852 --> 09:02.819
Kara...

09:02.853 --> 09:05.021
We'll be home soon enough.

09:21.972 --> 09:23.573
Hello.
Are you reading me?

09:23.607 --> 09:25.542
Come in.

09:25.609 --> 09:27.043
No, I cannot wait.

09:27.077 --> 09:29.479
This is Dr. Rachel Scott.

09:29.513 --> 09:32.382
I need to speak to the National
Security Adviser right away.

09:32.416 --> 09:34.851
<i>You</i> don't understand.
My mission is being compromised.

09:34.919 --> 09:37.420
And I need more time
to collect samples.

09:37.488 --> 09:39.022
We have a noisy channel.
I repeat.

09:39.056 --> 09:42.759
Mission objectives achieved.
We are ready to come home. Over.

09:43.961 --> 09:45.795
That's a negative, Commander.

09:45.829 --> 09:47.764
The mission has been extended.
Over.

09:47.798 --> 09:49.766
Extended? Why?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.434
Maintain radio silence
and current position

09:51.468 --> 09:53.570
until you receive
further instructions.

09:53.604 --> 09:56.706
Transmission terminated, sir.

10:03.492 --> 10:06.588
_

10:18.562 --> 10:20.563
The hell is that woman doing?

10:37.214 --> 10:38.481
Quincy...

10:38.516 --> 10:39.816
I think we've got it.

10:45.656 --> 10:47.257
Sorry, man.
Did I wake you?

10:48.592 --> 10:50.527
Doc told me
to keep my distance.

10:50.561 --> 10:52.729
The Admiral's
scaring off the birds.

10:52.763 --> 10:54.531
Sure it was the dog
and not your breath?

10:54.565 --> 10:55.965
Whatever.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.802
Man, we should've been
out of here days ago.

11:06.610 --> 11:07.711
What the...

11:07.745 --> 11:08.812
Aircraft in position

11:08.846 --> 11:11.548
seven six
decimal three five North,

11:11.582 --> 11:13.683
zero five nine
decimal five eight East...

11:13.718 --> 11:16.486
Captain, I have three--
make that five unknown aircraft

11:16.520 --> 11:18.922
approaching, range 24 nautical
miles, approximately 80 knots.

11:35.005 --> 11:37.374
Those are not ours, man.

11:37.441 --> 11:39.576
No.
They're Russian.

11:56.660 --> 11:57.827
Come on!

11:57.862 --> 11:59.929
Quincy,
we have to save the samples!

11:59.964 --> 12:01.464
- Help me!
- Leave the box! Let's go!

12:01.499 --> 12:04.267
Rachel, leave the box!

12:33.030 --> 12:34.864
Let's go! Right now!

12:38.502 --> 12:40.904
Let's go! Come on!

12:44.775 --> 12:46.943
Quincy!

13:08.032 --> 13:09.466
Drop.

13:10.768 --> 13:11.801
Aah!

13:20.644 --> 13:23.346
- Set General Quarters.
- General Quarters, General Quarters.

13:23.380 --> 13:24.614
All hands,
man your battle stations.

13:24.648 --> 13:26.082
Transit up and forward
starboard side,

13:26.116 --> 13:27.050
down and aft portside.

13:27.117 --> 13:29.419
Unknown aircraft...

13:29.487 --> 13:31.888
TAO, Air.
New air contact 80234

13:31.922 --> 13:34.424

Inbound...

13:34.458 --> 13:35.892
TAO, Surface manned and ready.

13:35.926 --> 13:37.794
Deploy scat.
CIWS to AAW Auto.

13:37.828 --> 13:39.662
Hold fire on.

13:46.704 --> 13:47.704
Aah!

13:57.181 --> 13:58.982
Take him alive!

14:01.118 --> 14:03.753
- All engines ahead flank! - Hard left
rudder! All engines ahead flank, aye!

14:07.625 --> 14:09.592
...United States naval warship.

14:09.627 --> 14:11.728
Identify yourself
and alter your course,

14:11.762 --> 14:14.597
or you will be subject
to defensive actions. Over.

14:14.665 --> 14:15.932
Evaluate as inbound missile.

14:15.966 --> 14:17.934
Recommend launch chaff.
Brace for shock!

14:17.968 --> 14:19.502
All hands, brace for shock.

14:34.485 --> 14:37.020
Take 'em out.

14:47.831 --> 14:48.998
Go to the 5 inch!

14:49.033 --> 14:50.867
Surface, TAO, kill track 5024.

14:50.901 --> 14:53.603
Surface, aye.
Guns, kill track 5024.

14:53.637 --> 14:54.904
Guns, aye.

15:06.450 --> 15:08.084
You okay?!

15:08.118 --> 15:10.453
Clear!
Come on.

15:18.862 --> 15:20.163
Where's Dr. Scott?!

15:20.197 --> 15:21.598
She's banged up pretty good.

15:21.632 --> 15:23.199
Doc's looking at her
in Hangar Two.

15:28.514 --> 15:29.938

15:32.610 --> 15:35.511
What'd he say?

15:35.546 --> 15:37.180
"The cure."

15:38.949 --> 15:40.984
He wants the cure.

Sync and corrections by n17t01

Get me Fleet Forces.
They don't answer, get me NMCC.

15:53.270 --> 15:54.804
They don't answer,
get me SecDef.

15:54.838 --> 15:57.039
- Supposed to be radio silent.
- Not anymore.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.210
I told you I'm fine.
Just hurry up.

16:01.245 --> 16:02.879
Where's Quincy?
I need my samples.

16:02.913 --> 16:04.180
You don't get your samples

16:04.214 --> 16:06.983
until you tell me
what's going on here.

16:07.017 --> 16:09.185
- You have no authority over me--
- Everybody out!

16:09.253 --> 16:12.188
You need to hand that case
over to me right now.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.923
We may have just gone to war
with Russia,

16:13.957 --> 16:15.524
and they were clearly
after you.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.560
No more secrets.

16:17.594 --> 16:18.794
Tell me about the cure!

16:18.829 --> 16:21.063
I can't say anything

16:21.131 --> 16:23.165
- until I speak to the National Security--
- I swear to God, I will throw this overboard!

16:23.200 --> 16:24.267
I want answers!

16:25.903 --> 16:27.803
You want answers?

16:31.975 --> 16:35.111
Seven months ago, outside Cairo,
there was an outbreak--

16:35.145 --> 16:37.713
a virus of unknown origin.

16:37.781 --> 16:38.981
Its genetic structure

16:39.049 --> 16:40.883
was like nothing any of us
had ever seen.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.885
It swept throughout
the village,

16:42.920 --> 16:46.055
killing everyone
that it infected.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.924
Egyptian officials claimed
the outbreak was contained,

16:47.958 --> 16:49.191
but it wasn't.

16:49.226 --> 16:51.961
Instead, it continued
to mutate and spread.

16:52.029 --> 16:56.232
The CDC and the WHO
wanted to sample the virus

16:56.266 --> 16:58.801
from the victims
to create a vaccine.

16:58.835 --> 17:01.237
But nothing worked.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.674
It was my belief that we needed
to find the primordial strain

17:04.708 --> 17:05.808
here in the Arctic.

17:05.842 --> 17:07.944
The birds.

17:07.978 --> 17:10.680
They're just the carriers.

17:10.714 --> 17:13.148
They pick up the virus
from the melting permafrost.

17:13.183 --> 17:15.184
We finally found
their feeding ground.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.118
So you have what you need
to stop this thing?

17:17.154 --> 17:19.288
I won't know until we get it
back to the lab.

17:19.323 --> 17:21.290
We're running out of time.

17:21.325 --> 17:22.992
The virus back home
is moving quicker

17:23.026 --> 17:24.627
than any of us
could've imagined.

17:24.661 --> 17:26.061
How would you know that?

17:26.096 --> 17:28.263
We've been radio silent
since we left Norfolk.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.900
Because I have
my own sat phone.

17:30.968 --> 17:34.870
We were at EMCON so no one
would know our position!

17:34.905 --> 17:37.974
We were at EMCON
to protect <i> my</i> mission...

17:38.008 --> 17:40.009
Not yours.

17:40.043 --> 17:42.144
Orders came
from the White House.

17:42.179 --> 17:44.680
Well, you led the Russians
right to us

17:44.715 --> 17:46.248
and endangered my entire crew.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.684
It was imperative
that I stay in contact

17:48.719 --> 17:50.653
with the labs back home
to keep them informed

17:50.721 --> 17:52.188
of my progress.

17:52.222 --> 17:54.423
I don't think you understand
what we're talking about here.

17:54.458 --> 17:55.891
Enlighten me.

17:55.926 --> 17:56.993
When we left Norfolk,

17:57.027 --> 18:00.429
the virus was at Phase Two,

18:00.464 --> 18:05.201
limited to small clusters
in Asia and Africa.

18:05.235 --> 18:08.371
We are now at Phase Six--

18:08.438 --> 18:10.806
global pandemic.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.144
80% of the world's population
is infected.

18:17.114 --> 18:21.817
The world is sick,
Captain Chandler...

18:21.852 --> 18:23.185
Very sick.

18:23.253 --> 18:25.321
Are you telling me
the whole world is dying,

18:25.355 --> 18:27.189
and they send two people
to save it?

18:28.992 --> 18:32.294
It took weeks to convince the
government to even send me here.

18:34.231 --> 18:36.132
Most of my colleagues
think that I'm insane.

18:36.166 --> 18:37.199
Are you?

18:37.234 --> 18:40.736
I told you...

18:40.804 --> 18:43.239
that what's in that case...

18:43.273 --> 18:45.307
might be the only hope
that we have.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.476
Captain, we have the
President of the United States

18:47.544 --> 18:49.512
on the vidcom.

18:53.050 --> 18:55.985
I'm sorry
you had to find out this way.

19:00.457 --> 19:02.958
Can I have my samples now?

19:09.933 --> 19:11.967
Stand by for the President.

19:12.035 --> 19:15.004
Morning, Commander.

19:15.038 --> 19:16.472
Ma'am?

19:16.506 --> 19:18.874
I know. The last you heard,
I was Speaker of the House.

19:18.909 --> 19:21.444
The President
died two months ago,

19:21.478 --> 19:24.146
the Vice President
a week later.

19:24.181 --> 19:26.115
What's left
of the federal government

19:26.149 --> 19:28.217
is holed up
200 feet below the White House,

19:28.251 --> 19:30.986
and communication
is getting spotty.

19:31.054 --> 19:33.989
So we need to know now...

19:34.024 --> 19:37.359
Does Dr. Scott have what
she needs to make a vaccine?

19:37.394 --> 19:38.794
She thinks so, ma'am.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.429
We are sending you
the coordinates

19:40.464 --> 19:44.300
to a secure bio-lab
on the coast of North Carolina.

19:44.334 --> 19:47.203
Ma'am, we were just attacked
by the Russians.

19:47.237 --> 19:50.172
Russia no longer has
a functioning government.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.807
From what we're hearing,

19:51.842 --> 19:55.077
a breakaway force is operating
on its own authority.

19:55.112 --> 19:57.813
We're trying to ascertain
all the facts.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.850
Ma'am, our families--
How do we find out if...

20:00.884 --> 20:03.085
I wish I could tell you,
Captain.

20:03.120 --> 20:07.089
Most of our population,
al-- with our armed forces,

20:07.124 --> 20:08.457
is dying or dead.

20:08.525 --> 20:10.926
We have no allies.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.495
We have no enemies.

20:12.562 --> 20:15.898
Just a world of sick,
desperate people.

20:15.932 --> 20:18.634
Your ship was fortunate enough
to be out of the hot zone

20:18.668 --> 20:20.102
these past months.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.838
If Dr. Scott
has the makings of a cure,

20:22.873 --> 20:25.474
you have to come home... now.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.284
<i>Supply chains</i>
<i>are completely broken.</i>

20:35.318 --> 20:37.052
<i>Food is in short supply.</i>
<i>Hospitals--</i>

20:37.087 --> 20:38.454
<i>...Chinese government</i>

20:38.522 --> 20:40.256
<i>have detonated the bomb</i>
<i>on its own people</i>

20:40.323 --> 20:42.158
<i>to stop the spread</i>
<i>of the deadly virus.</i>

20:42.192 --> 20:44.160
<i>With possibly</i>
<i>half the world's population</i>

20:44.194 --> 20:47.029
<i>dead or dying, rumors that</i>
<i>the US is hoarding a vaccine</i>

20:47.097 --> 20:48.864
<i>continue to swirl.</i>

20:48.932 --> 20:50.432
<i>Urban services</i>
<i>are completely overwhelmed.</i>

20:50.467 --> 20:52.935
<i>In most cities,</i>
<i>entire power grids are down,</i>

20:52.969 --> 20:54.904
<i>making communication</i>
<i>next to impossible.</i>

20:54.971 --> 20:57.206
<i>People are asking,</i>
<i>"Where is the government?"</i>

20:57.240 --> 21:00.309
<i>The virus has no treatment,</i>
<i>no vaccine.</i>

21:00.343 --> 21:03.913
- So this whole weapons test--
- It was all just a cover.

21:07.450 --> 21:09.285
And EMCON Alpha--

21:09.319 --> 21:11.587
Keep us in the dark about
what was going on at home.

21:13.256 --> 21:16.258
There's an unmanned refueling
station off the coast of France.

21:16.293 --> 21:18.994
If we operate at trail shaft,
we should just make it.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.930
How do we know
they have enough fuel

21:20.964 --> 21:22.431
to get us across the Atlantic?

21:22.465 --> 21:23.899
We don't.

21:26.436 --> 21:28.470
What do we tell the crew?

21:28.505 --> 21:30.339
Everything.

21:32.242 --> 21:34.677
We tell them everything.

21:43.119 --> 21:43.986
Captain?

21:45.121 --> 21:46.355
Crew's assembled.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.463
Ship's company, attention!

22:08.979 --> 22:12.081
I have news...

22:12.115 --> 22:13.182
from home.

22:30.255 --> 22:31.688
Any station this net,

22:31.723 --> 22:33.724
this is <i> Nathan James</i>
transmitting in the blind

22:33.758 --> 22:36.627
on FleetSat One, Two, and Three,
over.

22:36.661 --> 22:37.694
Is anybody out there?

22:37.695 --> 22:38.695
_

22:43.635 --> 22:45.536
<i>Due to widespread</i>
<i>system failure,</i>

22:45.570 --> 22:47.804
<i>the number you are calling</i>
<i>cannot be reached.</i>

22:47.839 --> 22:49.640
<i>This message</i>
<i>will not be updated.</i>

22:52.844 --> 22:54.311
Daddy!

22:54.345 --> 22:55.846
I can't believe
I'm gonna go that long

22:55.880 --> 22:57.281
without hearing your voice.

22:59.918 --> 23:01.451
We miss you, daddy.

23:13.631 --> 23:15.532
Captain's on the bridge!

23:17.635 --> 23:20.270
Sir, we're 50 miles
off the coast of Europe

23:20.305 --> 23:22.873
and still no contact
with French Naval Command.

23:22.907 --> 23:25.776
We've got extra watch
and guns at the ready.

23:25.810 --> 23:27.844
Were you able to reach home?

23:27.879 --> 23:29.813
No, sir.

23:29.847 --> 23:33.283
I think only four people
got through to anyone.

23:33.318 --> 23:36.420
And the news wasn't good.

23:36.454 --> 23:38.922
Last time we made port
in France,

23:38.957 --> 23:40.691
I promised my girlfriend

23:40.758 --> 23:43.660
we'd come back
and see Paris together.

23:45.730 --> 23:50.867
With everything, that's all
I keep thinking about.

23:50.902 --> 23:53.704
Well, that's the stuff
that matters.

23:57.075 --> 23:59.476
XO's on the bridge.

24:01.980 --> 24:04.014
I got through to home.

24:04.048 --> 24:07.718
My boy's gone.

24:07.785 --> 24:09.653
Oh, Mike.

24:09.687 --> 24:13.957
Christine is up in Deer Park,
some sort of safe zone for now.

24:14.025 --> 24:15.726
Girls are with her.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.794
- Why don't you take a break? I-I got it.
- No, no.

24:17.862 --> 24:20.831
I'm not gonna sit around
my cabin staring at the walls.

24:20.865 --> 24:22.599
This is where I need to be.

24:22.634 --> 24:23.934
Sir, we have a fire order.

24:23.968 --> 24:25.702
It came across all channels,
but it's garbled.

24:25.737 --> 24:27.738
They cannot authenticate.

24:30.508 --> 24:32.876
- Lieutenant? - Confirmed fire order,
sir, but the target's unclear.

24:32.910 --> 24:34.478
Vampire, Vampire, Vampire!

24:34.512 --> 24:35.979
Missile incoming high and fast.

24:36.014 --> 24:38.348
Spin four Tomahawks.
Hold for a target location.

24:38.383 --> 24:39.950
These coordinates
don't make any sense.

24:39.984 --> 24:41.718
- No response from command.
- ECO, aye. Break.

24:41.786 --> 24:43.120
MM1, align four Echo missiles

24:43.154 --> 24:44.721
and place them
in the reload pool.

24:44.756 --> 24:48.025
- Do we have a target ID?
- Now five-one and trail.

24:48.059 --> 24:50.661
Missile fired from a surface ship
in the North Atlantic.

24:50.695 --> 24:54.464
Ballistic missile traveling
at 9,700 miles per hour.

24:54.499 --> 24:55.932
Confirmed. We have
a nuclear burn in the air.

24:55.967 --> 24:57.934
We have no chance to intercept.

24:57.969 --> 24:59.169
Batten down.

24:59.203 --> 25:01.438
Officer at the one,
seal the ship.

25:01.472 --> 25:03.306
Prepare for nuclear detonation.

25:03.374 --> 25:04.708
This is no drill.

25:04.742 --> 25:06.877
Sir, the missile overshot us.
Headed for land.

25:11.649 --> 25:13.617
Detonation in 12 seconds.

25:18.556 --> 25:19.923
Bridge, shield your eyes.

25:22.427 --> 25:24.061
God help us.

25:41.446 --> 25:45.649
Give me a status report on
the switchboard and generators.

25:45.683 --> 25:47.651
- Who's that?
- Chung, sir.

25:47.685 --> 25:48.985
- Anyone hurt?
- No, sir.

25:49.053 --> 25:50.721
What's our engine status?

25:50.755 --> 25:52.923
Sir, the, uh, electromagnetic
pulse from the bomb

25:52.957 --> 25:54.124
blew our grid.

25:54.192 --> 25:56.226
Engines won't spin.
No propulsion.

25:56.260 --> 25:58.095
Emergency lights operating
on battery power.

25:58.129 --> 25:59.129
Captain!

25:59.163 --> 26:00.764
That you, Master Chief?

26:00.798 --> 26:02.499
Commo says the radios are down.

26:02.533 --> 26:04.401
No way to get messages
in or out.

26:04.435 --> 26:06.737
We need to move this ship
away from the blast zone.

26:06.804 --> 26:09.740
Lieutenant, let's get
those engines back online.

26:09.774 --> 26:10.874
Yes, sir.

26:12.543 --> 26:14.010
What temperature are we at?

26:14.045 --> 26:16.046
41 degrees, and we've lost
negative pressure.

26:16.114 --> 26:17.781
Damn it.
We're gonna lose everything.

26:17.815 --> 26:18.715
Okay, get the ice.

26:20.785 --> 26:22.052
Fuses in.

26:22.086 --> 26:24.087
Open valves three, four,
and five.

26:24.155 --> 26:26.823
Shut valve to auxiliary engines
and emergency air.

26:26.891 --> 26:28.058
Fuel lever on start.

26:28.092 --> 26:29.659
All right.
Give it a kick start.

26:31.696 --> 26:34.231
Sir, we only have
one more fuse.

26:34.265 --> 26:37.000
The jet stream's pushing
everything North-Northeast.

26:37.034 --> 26:40.070
We got a cloud of radiation
about to drop right on us.

26:40.104 --> 26:41.505
Give it to me.

26:42.006 --> 26:43.473
- Sir, it won't hold.
- It'll hold.

26:44.208 --> 26:46.810
- Captain, let somebody else do this.
- Rip it.

26:46.844 --> 26:48.145
- Get your hand out of there.
- You heard me.

26:48.179 --> 26:49.980
- Captain, don't.
- I said rip it!

27:03.728 --> 27:06.129
Badass, Captain.

27:06.197 --> 27:09.499
Badass.

27:11.602 --> 27:13.570
All engines ahead full.
Left full rudder.

27:13.604 --> 27:14.971
Steady on new course 270.

27:15.006 --> 27:16.139
What's our fuel percentage?

27:16.174 --> 27:17.707
11%, sir.

27:17.742 --> 27:20.710
Even at max conserve,
we'll run dry in six hours.

27:20.745 --> 27:22.145
Any contacts on surface search?

27:22.180 --> 27:23.847
No, sir.
30-mile range.

27:23.915 --> 27:26.183
- What is that in the radar shadow?
- Change range scale.

27:26.217 --> 27:28.585
Looks like a ship.

27:28.619 --> 27:30.554
Calculate a course
to intercept.

27:50.007 --> 27:52.642
Markings indicate
the ship is Italian.

27:52.677 --> 27:55.111
Bridge to Bridge Operational?

27:55.179 --> 27:56.713
I think so, sir.

27:58.950 --> 28:02.485
Vessel in vicinity 48 degrees
North, 15 degrees West,

28:02.520 --> 28:05.856
this is US Navy Warship 151
on your starboard bow.

28:05.890 --> 28:08.058
Acknowledge
and identify yourself. Over.

28:23.028 --> 28:25.829
Smith, Rowler, Benz, Green,
you're on provisions.

28:25.864 --> 28:28.766
Master Chief, you'll assist
Chung with the unrep.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.802
We get as much food and fuel
as we can and we get out.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.704
Let's move.

28:33.738 --> 28:36.941
Remember, if the ship
has been impacted by the virus,

28:36.975 --> 28:40.077
it's airborne
and highly, highly contagious,

28:40.111 --> 28:43.414
even from
a recently deceased corpse.

28:43.448 --> 28:46.817
You must keep your helmets on
at all times.

28:46.851 --> 28:50.187
You trained for this.
You can do it.

28:51.923 --> 28:54.024
Lieutenant, send
naval warfare to the kitchen.

28:54.092 --> 28:55.759
Get as much food and supplies
as you can.

28:55.794 --> 28:56.961
We got the stock rooms.

28:57.028 --> 28:58.595
Benzo and I will take
the starboard side,

28:58.663 --> 29:00.064
make our way to the galley.

29:00.131 --> 29:01.665
Master Chief, get that fuel line
across and pump it.

29:01.700 --> 29:02.766
Sending the pull line.

29:08.406 --> 29:11.041
Sending over the hose.

29:11.109 --> 29:13.177
Feed the line.

29:13.211 --> 29:14.645
Engineering, Bridge.

29:14.679 --> 29:17.681
Engage fueling.

29:17.716 --> 29:19.817
System online!
Commence fueling!

29:42.841 --> 29:44.108
Ship's clear.

29:44.175 --> 29:45.843
No one alive,
Commander Chandler. Over.

30:37.262 --> 30:40.731
Help me.

30:40.765 --> 30:42.032
Help me.

30:42.067 --> 30:43.267
Dr. Scott!

30:44.903 --> 30:48.005
Help me.

31:02.287 --> 31:04.188
Help me.

31:04.255 --> 31:05.823
He wants help.

31:05.890 --> 31:08.092
The only thing that can
help him now is morphine.

31:14.766 --> 31:16.133
Let go.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.135
Let go.

31:35.019 --> 31:37.087
Oh, shit!

31:37.155 --> 31:38.088
Frankie!

31:40.208 --> 31:42.578
Oh, fu--
Oh, damn!

31:42.760 --> 31:44.228
Put your mask on!

31:44.295 --> 31:45.395
No! It's off!

31:47.665 --> 31:49.266
Oh, shit.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.943
Frankie. Hey.

32:00.011 --> 32:03.814
Frankie!
It's all right!

32:03.882 --> 32:05.716
Look! Get up!

32:05.750 --> 32:08.085
Get away, man.
Get away!

32:10.088 --> 32:12.122
Master Chief,
we're running dry here.

32:12.157 --> 32:13.891
Engineering, Bridge.
Disengage.

32:13.925 --> 32:15.826
Yes, sir.
They've got it, Mr. Chung.

32:15.894 --> 32:17.728
- Let's get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

32:17.762 --> 32:19.630
- You're gonna be fine!
- Get away!

32:19.664 --> 32:22.232
- Just take the food and
go get the hell out of here. - No!

32:22.300 --> 32:24.868
- I'm not leaving you, Frankie!
- I'm a dead man.

32:24.903 --> 32:26.203
Just get out of here.

32:26.237 --> 32:28.272
No, man.
I'm not leaving you!

32:28.339 --> 32:30.240
You tell him.

32:32.377 --> 32:33.810
He's been exposed.

32:33.845 --> 32:35.112
We put him back in his suit

32:35.146 --> 32:37.114
and we quarantine him
on the ship!

32:37.148 --> 32:40.250
You can't risk it, sir.
Mission comes first.

32:40.285 --> 32:43.187
I'm not all too interested
in dying like these people.

32:43.221 --> 32:44.688
Give me the gun, Sailor.

32:44.722 --> 32:47.291
Frankie, don't be stupid.

32:47.358 --> 32:49.793
I am giving you a direct order!

32:49.827 --> 32:51.094
Put down that weapon!

32:51.129 --> 32:52.362
Frankie, no!

33:10.752 --> 33:14.055
Lord God,
by the power of your word,

33:14.122 --> 33:17.825
you stilled the chaos
of the primeval seas,

33:17.859 --> 33:20.895
made the raging waters
of the flood subside,

33:20.929 --> 33:23.831
and calmed the storm
on the Sea of Galilee.

33:23.865 --> 33:28.302
As we commit our brother
Franklin Edward Benz to the sea,

33:28.370 --> 33:31.572
grant him peace and tranquility

33:31.606 --> 33:35.576
until that day when Franklin
and all those who believe in you

33:35.610 --> 33:38.746
will be raised
to the glory of new life

33:38.814 --> 33:41.615
promised in the waters
of baptism.

33:41.650 --> 33:42.683
Amen.

33:59.935 --> 34:02.636
Left face!

34:02.671 --> 34:05.740
Present arms!

34:05.774 --> 34:06.774
Ready.

34:06.808 --> 34:08.309
Aim.

34:09.344 --> 34:11.779
Fire!

34:12.981 --> 34:14.315
Fire!

34:14.349 --> 34:15.382
Ready.

34:17.219 --> 34:19.386
Fire!

34:33.134 --> 34:35.601
These people depend on me.

34:35.637 --> 34:39.440
I'm in uncharted
territory here.

34:39.474 --> 34:41.175
We all are.

34:41.242 --> 34:44.378
Not you.
You saw this coming.

34:44.411 --> 34:46.080
I never thought
it would spread so fast.

34:48.583 --> 34:50.650
But now I know why it did.

34:50.685 --> 34:54.054
I compared the blood
that we took from the Italian

34:54.089 --> 34:56.489
to some samples I took
before we left.

34:56.524 --> 34:58.425
The virus
has an extra gene now,

34:58.460 --> 35:01.428
which could have only been added
with human intervention.

35:01.463 --> 35:03.263
So it was weaponized.

35:03.298 --> 35:04.631
Maybe.

35:04.666 --> 35:08.001
Or maybe it escaped
from a lab somehow.

35:08.036 --> 35:10.204
But I think I know
how to stop it.

35:10.238 --> 35:13.307
All the virus cares about
is replicating.

35:13.341 --> 35:16.543
The engineered version
lets it do that unchecked.

35:16.578 --> 35:18.779
So it no longer
needs to mutate,

35:18.813 --> 35:23.517
which makes it stable and easier
to defeat with a vaccine.

35:23.551 --> 35:25.686
Then why hasn't anybody
done that yet?

35:25.720 --> 35:29.256
Because they didn't have
the primordial sample.

35:30.892 --> 35:32.193
We do.

35:41.036 --> 35:42.770
_

35:45.207 --> 35:47.141
Bridge, Commo,
get me the Captain.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.747
Sir, we finally
got the comms up.

35:53.782 --> 35:55.049
This came through.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.418
- A message from POTUS.
- This is five days old.

35:57.452 --> 35:59.186
Yes, sir. It was transmitted
while the radios were down.

35:59.221 --> 36:01.121
We need to confirm these orders.
Get me the Pentagon.

36:01.189 --> 36:02.890
Sir, I've-- I've been trying,
but there's no answer.

36:02.924 --> 36:06.727
I'll try the lab.
Get me the Presidential bunker.

36:08.129 --> 36:09.496
North Carolina's not safe.

36:09.531 --> 36:11.198
President wants us
to change course for Mayport.

36:11.266 --> 36:13.267
There's a lab in Jacksonville
that's supposed to be secure.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.135
There's no answer there
or the Pentagon.

36:15.170 --> 36:18.105
Sir, nothing from the bunker.

36:18.139 --> 36:19.473
Maybe our signal's
not getting out.

36:19.507 --> 36:21.108
We check the transmit side?

36:21.142 --> 36:23.010
That's not the problem.
Their phones are ringing.

36:23.044 --> 36:25.546
Sir, I have another message
coming through!

36:27.349 --> 36:29.049
It was transmitted
at the same time as POTUS'.

36:29.084 --> 36:30.351
It looks like
a much bigger file.

36:32.454 --> 36:34.455
- It's an mpeg, sir.
- Play it.

36:38.593 --> 36:39.994
<i>Tom.</i>

36:42.430 --> 36:44.031
<i>We're at your father's cabin.</i>

36:44.065 --> 36:45.466
<i>He thinks he has a way</i>
<i>to get this message out</i>

36:45.500 --> 36:49.169
<i>through his contacts</i>
<i>at the Pentagon.</i>

36:49.204 --> 36:52.306
<i>I have no idea when you</i>
<i>might be seeing this</i>

36:52.374 --> 36:56.076
<i>or where you are.</i>

36:56.111 --> 36:58.212
<i>We're all healthy.</i>

36:58.246 --> 37:01.081
<i>We managed to get out early</i>

37:01.149 --> 37:03.350
<i>and have been up here</i>
<i>for a couple months already.</i>

37:03.385 --> 37:09.056
<i>We haven't heard anything</i>
<i>from your brother or sister</i>

37:09.090 --> 37:10.324
<i>for a while.</i>

37:10.358 --> 37:12.326
<i>My, um...</i>

37:14.496 --> 37:16.330
<i>My sister didn't make it.</i>

37:16.364 --> 37:20.935
<i>But, honey, we're fine.</i>

37:20.969 --> 37:23.437
<i>We really are.</i>

37:23.471 --> 37:28.208
<i>And I really hope</i>
<i>that you are, too.</i>

37:28.243 --> 37:30.411
<i>Kids!</i>

37:30.445 --> 37:32.046
<i>Come on out here.</i>

37:32.080 --> 37:33.580
<i>It's a tape for dad.</i>

37:33.615 --> 37:36.317
<i>Come on. Come.</i>
<i>Come say hi.</i>

37:40.322 --> 37:42.957
<i>Daddy, where are you?</i>

37:43.024 --> 37:44.892
<i>We miss you.</i>

37:44.926 --> 37:47.528
<i>We love you, daddy.</i>

37:47.595 --> 37:51.231
<i>Just get here if you can.</i>

37:51.266 --> 37:54.234
<i>We love you so much.</i>

37:54.269 --> 37:57.271
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

37:57.305 --> 37:59.473
<i>Let's turn it off.</i>

38:08.710 --> 38:12.535
_

38:15.590 --> 38:17.424
Hey.

38:19.327 --> 38:22.829
I don't know
what we're going home to.

38:29.470 --> 38:33.273
No radiation detected
within a 100-mile radius, sir.

38:33.308 --> 38:37.244
If America was nuked,
it wasn't here.

38:37.278 --> 38:39.913
We're home.

38:59.467 --> 39:02.469
You said you have what it takes
to make the vaccine.

39:02.503 --> 39:04.838
If you had to, could you do it
here on the ship?

39:04.872 --> 39:08.575
The lab wasn't built for that.

39:08.609 --> 39:10.577
It's for collecting data.

39:10.611 --> 39:11.878
But if you had to, could you?

39:16.884 --> 39:18.785
The expeditionary team
will forward deploy

39:18.820 --> 39:20.721
and secure the area
for the next group.

39:20.755 --> 39:22.456
Hopefully we'll find support.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.491
Got to be prepared
for anything.

39:24.559 --> 39:27.527
Everyone carries
their own biohazard suit.

39:27.562 --> 39:30.430
We do not engage
unless we are engaged.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.969
Prepare your people
and await further orders.

39:36.003 --> 39:37.971
Dismissed.

39:47.415 --> 39:49.316
There's still no answer
from POTUS

39:49.350 --> 39:51.351
and nothing from Mayport
or the lab.

39:51.386 --> 39:53.387
We can't even get
an FM radio signal.

39:53.421 --> 39:55.622
If the power grid's down,
that means everything's down.

39:55.657 --> 39:58.625
We'll know more when
we get boots on the ground.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.661
Mike, we're not going home.

40:00.695 --> 40:03.497
What are you talking about?

40:03.565 --> 40:06.133
The lab's 200 miles inland.

40:06.167 --> 40:08.135
You saw the news footage.

40:08.169 --> 40:09.670
We'll fight our way in there
if we have to.

40:09.704 --> 40:11.138
And then what?

40:11.172 --> 40:13.140
Generators run out
in a couple weeks,

40:13.174 --> 40:15.542
maybe the civilian population
tries to overrun it.

40:15.577 --> 40:17.044
There's too many variables.

40:17.112 --> 40:18.679
So, what do we do?
We stay on the ship?

40:18.746 --> 40:21.048
- Dr. Scott says she has
what she needs right here. - Dr. Scott.

40:21.082 --> 40:22.349
We have standing orders

40:22.417 --> 40:24.051
from the President
of the United States.

40:24.085 --> 40:25.552
From five days ago.

40:25.587 --> 40:27.588
In the absence
of a command structure,

40:27.622 --> 40:30.324
I decide what's in the best
interest of our mission.

40:30.358 --> 40:33.060
And we have enough food here
to last us what, a week?

40:33.094 --> 40:34.161
How much fuel?

40:34.195 --> 40:35.395
We'll find what we need.

40:35.430 --> 40:37.464
- We'll die out there.
- No. We will not.

40:37.499 --> 40:39.066
Tom, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.135
But it's not gonna work.
People want to get home.

40:41.169 --> 40:44.571
And who exactly gets to go home

40:44.606 --> 40:49.676
when we have 80 biohazard suits
for 216 people?

40:52.580 --> 40:53.780
We draw lots.

40:53.848 --> 40:56.650
I can't think like that, Mike.

40:56.684 --> 40:58.285
It'll at least
give people a chance

40:58.319 --> 41:00.187
to get back to their families,
to say goodbye.

41:00.255 --> 41:02.656
I'm not letting anybody
on this ship give up.

41:02.690 --> 41:04.024
That's not your call.
You don't get to play God.

41:04.092 --> 41:06.827
I'm still the Captain
of this ship.

41:06.861 --> 41:09.229
Now, I've laid out our mission.

41:09.264 --> 41:12.666
I expect you to fall in line.

41:22.644 --> 41:24.745
Captain's on the bridge.

41:36.424 --> 41:39.092
Left full rudder.
All engines ahead flank.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.360
Sir?

41:42.530 --> 41:44.364
Left full rudder.

41:44.399 --> 41:46.400
All engines ahead flank.

41:47.835 --> 41:50.370
Aye, aye.
Left full rudder.

41:50.405 --> 41:51.772
All engines ahead flank.

41:51.806 --> 41:53.640
Left full rudder.
All engines ahead flank, aye.

42:13.394 --> 42:15.562
This is the Captain speaking.

42:15.597 --> 42:18.532
<i>We have no contact with home,</i>

42:18.566 --> 42:20.400
<i>and I have good reason</i>
<i>to believe</i>

42:20.435 --> 42:23.270
<i>that the American government</i>
<i>is no longer functioning.</i>

42:23.304 --> 42:26.707
The country we all hoped we were
coming back to no longer exists.

42:26.741 --> 42:29.243
<i>We left these shores</i>
<i>four months ago</i>

42:29.277 --> 42:31.545
<i>as members</i>
<i>of the United States Navy.</i>

42:31.579 --> 42:34.281
<i>But now we are more than that.</i>

42:34.315 --> 42:36.950
<i>Now our duty</i>
<i>is to the entire world.</i>

42:36.985 --> 42:41.755
On board this ship
is the hope...

42:41.789 --> 42:45.192
for our futures,
for our families,

42:45.226 --> 42:47.427
and for all of humanity,

42:47.462 --> 42:49.796
because in that lab
in our helo bay

42:49.831 --> 42:52.532
<i>are the ingredients for a cure.</i>

42:52.567 --> 42:54.901
And this is the safest place
on Earth

42:54.936 --> 42:57.471
for our scientists
to do their work--

42:57.505 --> 42:59.873
<i>on a $3 billion</i>
<i>piece of machinery</i>

42:59.907 --> 43:03.677
<i>protected by 216 sailors</i>
<i>in the US Navy.</i>

43:03.711 --> 43:06.780
Our mission now is simple.

43:06.814 --> 43:09.549
We do whatever it takes
to stay alive at sea

43:09.584 --> 43:11.285
until they find that cure.

43:11.319 --> 43:13.720
<i>There's an unmanned</i>
<i>food and fuel station</i>

43:13.755 --> 43:15.255
<i>outside Guantanamo Bay.</i>

43:15.323 --> 43:17.724
<i>For the moment,</i>
<i>that is our destination.</i>

43:21.729 --> 43:26.199
We've lost so much already.

43:26.234 --> 43:29.269
But this is the most courageous
and resilient crew

43:29.304 --> 43:32.205
with whom I have ever
been privileged to serve.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.742
<i>We will come through this</i>
<i>together,</i>

43:35.810 --> 43:39.279
<i>and we will prevail.</i>

43:40.815 --> 43:42.416
Carry on.

43:57.965 --> 43:59.766
Attention on deck.

44:04.772 --> 44:06.740
Lieutenant Granderson,

44:06.774 --> 44:08.742
permission to salute
the Captain.

44:08.776 --> 44:11.645
Permission granted.

44:13.581 --> 44:15.015
Hand salute!
