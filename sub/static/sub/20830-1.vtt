WEBVTT

01:52.029 --> 01:54.657
- Kilian, time to go.
- Coming.

02:04.542 --> 02:09.003
Always remember me as I am now.
I shall do the same with you.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.721
Good luck.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.808
My luck runs out here and now.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.519
Goodbye.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.356
Farewell.

02:38.576 --> 02:44.790
Eternal rest grant
unto Jacobo de Rabaltué, O Lord

02:44.874 --> 02:48.669
And let perpetual light
shine upon him.

02:48.752 --> 02:53.007
May his soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed,

02:53.090 --> 02:57.845
through the mercy of God,
rest in peace.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.310
Come on, it's a bit quieter in here.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.064
We had so many things left to say.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.276
Dad...
I should have come earlier.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.196
How's your father?

03:15.279 --> 03:18.449
He has good days
when he seems to be alright...

03:18.532 --> 03:20.034
and others when he isn't.

03:20.117 --> 03:23.245
He seems to lose it,
saying things I don't understand

03:23.329 --> 03:25.497
about Bioko, the plantation...

03:25.581 --> 03:28.459
It's as if the past
is more real than the present.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.045
Sometimes he looks at me
like he doesn't even know me.

03:32.630 --> 03:36.091
And sometimes I'm not sure
I know him either.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.386
I know exactly what you mean.

03:39.470 --> 03:43.515
Last week the lawyers from the ski
resort were here again.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.978
They want to finalise the purchase
of our land as soon as possible

03:48.062 --> 03:50.022
so they can start building in the
spring.

03:50.105 --> 03:53.525
And, well, we need your signature
to finalise the sale.

03:53.651 --> 03:56.195
I think I put the contract
over here.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.949
Clarence,
I know this isn't the best time,

04:00.032 --> 04:02.534
but the sooner we get this
over with, the better.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.203
Here...

04:04.286 --> 04:07.998
- What's this?
- My father's diary.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.000
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.544
- Daniela.
- What?

04:12.628 --> 04:13.963
Kilian.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.422
Coming.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.486
Dad, hey. Hi.

04:38.779 --> 04:42.574
Again?
My daughter, I'm so sorry.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.494
I'm sorry.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.997
- Could you help me, Clarence?
- Yes.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.086
OK, done.

05:22.072 --> 05:26.201
I don't understand you, Dad...
but it sounds very pretty.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.915
Daniela, stay with me.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.044
Yes, Dad.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.448
Julia.

06:06.492 --> 06:08.744
- You really didn't have to.
- It's no bother.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.372
Would you like a cup of hot
chocolate?

06:11.538 --> 06:14.666
The day I say no to that
is the day you can start worrying!

06:15.292 --> 06:18.003
While I was sorting through some
papers in the office...

06:19.421 --> 06:27.421
I found part of a letter that looks
like it was sent from Africa.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.235
Forgive me.

06:41.318 --> 06:44.071
An old woman's sentimental nonsense.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.241
It's my husband's handwriting.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.660
Do you know who he's talking about?

06:49.743 --> 06:53.705
He mentions a woman and some children
they used to send money to...

06:53.789 --> 06:55.416
I can read, Clarence.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.877
I had a look at the accounts...

06:59.002 --> 07:03.132
and it looks like regular payments
were sent from here.

07:03.340 --> 07:07.845
- Maybe you should ask your uncle.
- He's in no condition to talk.

07:08.887 --> 07:12.099
I wouldn't want anyone important
to be forgotten about.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.477
Julia, what's wrong?

07:16.437 --> 07:19.857
If we hadn't had to leave
the way we did...

07:21.191 --> 07:24.528
I don't think
I would've moved back to Pasolobino.

07:28.031 --> 07:31.827
And my father? Would he
have liked to have stayed too?

07:31.910 --> 07:34.830
Your father was never one
to show his feelings.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.750
I know that better than anyone.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.378
Well, perhaps my mother,

07:41.462 --> 07:44.631
but she didn't seem to be
a particularly happy woman.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.177
I've decided to go to Bioko.

07:49.887 --> 07:53.098
It's been almost forty years
since we left.

07:53.182 --> 07:55.267
You won't like what you find.

07:55.392 --> 07:59.104
- It doesn't matter.
- The Fernando Poo we knew is gone.

08:00.147 --> 08:04.359
Also, it's a very dangerous trip
for a woman travelling on her own.

08:06.028 --> 08:09.198
There's no way I'm going to be able
to talk you out of it, is there?

08:11.408 --> 08:13.327
You know, Clarence,

08:13.410 --> 08:18.415
to the Bubis, nothing is as important
as honoring your ancestors.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.584
Remember that.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.670
When you get to Sampaka
ask for Simón.

08:23.754 --> 08:26.798
He was Kilian's houseboy for all
those years

08:26.882 --> 08:29.301
and he was also Manuel's contact
for the money

08:29.384 --> 08:31.762
that was being sent to Guinea
this whole time.

08:39.477 --> 08:45.275
He might put you in touch with
someone just a little older than you

08:45.359 --> 08:47.486
called Fernando.

08:48.237 --> 08:53.408
It shouldn't be too hard,
that place is as small as this valley.

08:58.914 --> 09:01.542
I will make sure she gets your money.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.629
She and her children
are fine thanks to what you send.

09:38.120 --> 09:42.040
January 18th, 1954.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.168
Dear Catalina...

09:45.252 --> 09:51.550
I stared at our house's façade as if
I was trying to memorise every detail.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.719
Kilian! Hurry up!

09:54.678 --> 09:56.346
You've still got time.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.557
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.517
Come on.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.235
There are no men left in our house.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.946
If only it wasn't so far away.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.408
Six thousand kilometers is nothing,
Mum.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.917
We should continue on skis.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.295
We'd better say goodbye now.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.006
Just in case you get hungry.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.718
I'm really going to miss you.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.554
Write in this when you think of me.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.849
That way I can read everything
when you get back.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.309
Thank you.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.273
- Take care of your brother.
- Yes.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.028
Come back soon.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.363
Goodbye, Mum.

11:16.927 --> 11:20.514
I don't understand why this language is
written one way and pronounced another.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.685
You won't have to write
to the Nigerians.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.938
I've underlined
everything you need to know.

11:29.064 --> 11:32.484
Jacobo, what do you know
about life in this country?

11:32.567 --> 11:33.694
Nothing.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.284
I can't wait to see the sea.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.674
February 2, 1954.

11:56.633 --> 12:01.221
Dear Catalina, there's not long left
until we reach Guinea.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.142
We ran into Manuel Ruiz on board.

12:05.809 --> 12:09.396
I already knew him
from Santa Isabel Hospital.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.440
He's going to be
the new doctor on the estate.

12:12.274 --> 12:17.571
I can't wait to get to my birthplace
and discover indigenous Guinea.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.406
The real Guinea.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.283
If anything is left of it.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.719
What do you think?

12:41.887 --> 12:43.180
He's speechless!

12:44.806 --> 12:47.601
See all those black people?
They're all the same.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.561
Just like sheep,
you won't be able

12:49.644 --> 12:52.105
to tell them apart
until a few months from now.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.920
Father.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.129
Jacobo.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.554
- Welcome to your birthplace, Son.
- Thank you.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.348
How are you?

13:27.557 --> 13:29.059
Are you alright?

13:29.142 --> 13:33.563
Yes, I'm fine. This last campaign
was harder than we expected.

13:33.647 --> 13:37.025
This suitcase is full of things
Mum packed for you.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.069
I am sure you'll be feeling better
in no time.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.037
Good afternoon.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.458
This is my son Kilian and that's
Manuel, the estate's new doctor.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.753
Welcome.
And thank you for the package.

13:57.796 --> 14:01.925
First lesson, Kilian,
you have to keep the guards happy.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.469
Every now and again
give them cigarettes,

14:04.553 --> 14:06.054
whisky, eggs, whatever.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.931
The happier you keep them,

14:08.181 --> 14:09.861
the faster they'll come
when you need them.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.269
Enough lessons.
And let Osë drive.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.314
I don't think the boss
would like to see you driving his car.

14:16.398 --> 14:19.067
Garuz won't know, will he, Osë?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.321
Come on.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.076
Everything appears to be in order.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.830
How is it that a young man
with a promising future like you

15:13.914 --> 15:16.541
prefers the colony to Madrid?
Thank you.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.752
Well, my second vocation is Botany.

15:18.835 --> 15:23.298
I'd like to study the local plant
species and their medical applications.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.592
I'm not sure you'll have time for that.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.802
And you, young man?

15:27.886 --> 15:31.097
We need energetic
and decisive people around here.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.601
You'll spend the first two weeks
focussed on learning.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.354
Observe your colleagues,
do as they do.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.982
You'll be going
to Obsay with Gregorio.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.318
But won't he with me at Yacato?

15:45.820 --> 15:50.241
Obsay is not working as well as it
should. A new person will be good.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.409
Yes, sir.

15:51.493 --> 15:54.913
Treat the workers
with authority but also justice.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.641
If you don't resolve issues
properly, you'll lose their respect.

15:58.249 --> 15:59.459
Thank you, Mr Lorenzo.

16:02.253 --> 16:05.256
- Antón, who is his houseboy?
- Simón, the new one.

16:05.382 --> 16:09.803
Don't let him get away with anything
or he will come and go as he wishes.

16:10.345 --> 16:11.388
That will be all.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.432
- Good morning.
- Thank you very much.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.648
Obey.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.275
I order you.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.611
Come here.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.239
I am the boss.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.907
I am the boss.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.994
Work.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.412
You get to work!

16:41.334 --> 16:44.796
- Massa the drum is sounding, wake up.
- I'm coming. One moment.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.801
I'm coming! One moment!

16:53.513 --> 16:55.015
Simón, Massa. At your service.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.725
It's still night time.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.686
When the work starts
it will be daytime.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.772
In 10 minutes everybody
will have to be standing outside.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.316
- I'll help you get dressed.
- Thanks, I can do it alone.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.153
- I'll help.
- I'll do it! Give me that.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.791
Come on. Another minute
and you won't get paid.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.421
- Good luck.
- That man who's coming with dad...

17:26.503 --> 17:28.548
- is Gregorio.
- Good morning.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.425
You'd better behave with my boy.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.762
Another Rabaltué.
The whole family will be here soon.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.639
Let's go, father. Bye.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.641
20 men per brigade.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.977
Start counting.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.231
I am sick, Massa.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.902
Every day the same old story!

18:04.125 --> 18:05.293
Get to work.

18:08.755 --> 18:13.927
Lies. They always lie. Come on.
Excuses and superstitions.

18:14.219 --> 18:17.138
What do you think your brother is
carrying around that melongo rod for?

18:17.305 --> 18:21.726
The owner wants his profits and it's
our job to see that he gets them.

18:21.810 --> 18:24.854
You're in charge of those...
What the...?

18:24.938 --> 18:27.190
- Snake! Snake!
- What's the hell's wrong?

18:27.273 --> 18:28.316
Snake!

18:36.991 --> 18:38.701
Get up there and kill it.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.748
Get up there!

19:08.022 --> 19:10.066
Is this what you're afraid of?

19:11.151 --> 19:12.360
This?

19:22.620 --> 19:26.749
Send the injured to hospital.
The rest go back to work.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.797
Come on, work harder!

20:16.966 --> 20:18.343
How is your first day going?

20:19.260 --> 20:20.929
What are these songs about?

20:21.012 --> 20:22.472
About work.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.307
Working and not thinking.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.894
What's wrong?
You like watching?

22:33.061 --> 22:34.312
I'm sorry.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.772
You left me halfway.

22:36.898 --> 22:38.816
None of that.
This time doesn't count.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.370
Don't veer off the path.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.373
You wouldn't last more than
a couple of hours in the jungle.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.437
Kilian!

23:21.984 --> 23:23.444
Don't you remember me?

23:25.613 --> 23:27.198
- Julia.
- Yes.

23:29.367 --> 23:32.578
Forgive me, you look so...

23:32.662 --> 23:35.832
- You've grown a lot too. We were...
- I don't know.

23:35.998 --> 23:36.916
Ten years old?

23:36.999 --> 23:39.419
Has it been that long
since we last saw each other?

23:39.585 --> 23:41.170
- How are you?
- Very well, come in.

23:41.254 --> 23:44.006
- How are your parents?
- They're doing really well.

23:44.549 --> 23:47.093
I keep promising myself
I'll go back to Pasolobino,

23:47.176 --> 23:49.554
but for one reason or another
I end up not going.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.766
I always ask Jacobo
about the mountains.

23:55.726 --> 23:58.438
- By the way, is he back?
- Yes, but...

23:59.397 --> 24:00.815
Here he is.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.775
Hi, Julia. How are you?

24:02.859 --> 24:04.735
How are you doing?

24:04.819 --> 24:06.237
- Very well, you?
- Very good.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.531
- Did you enjoy your vacations?
- Fantastic.

24:08.614 --> 24:11.033
Didn't you miss us even a little?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.291
Well, we're in a big hurry today.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.671
Let me see...

24:25.673 --> 24:29.510
My parents are organizing a farewell
dinner for Dámaso, the doctor.

24:29.594 --> 24:32.221
You could come over too,
it's going to be fun.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.850
Kilian looks like he needs
a break from the forest.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.226
We'd be happy to.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.605
You idiot.

24:40.688 --> 24:41.731
Marvelous.

24:42.273 --> 24:43.774
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

24:44.442 --> 24:47.195
I'm going to put this in too
for the mosquito bites.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.238
- OK.
- It works wonders.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.698
- Thank you.
- Let me see.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.330
Jacobo.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.875
Look at how happy they are.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.171
Just dying to spend their wages
in Santa Isabel.

25:05.922 --> 25:06.923
Look.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.051
And we have to go to a stupid dinner
because you can't say "no".

25:10.134 --> 25:13.429
- Julia is a charming girl.
- They're all charming, Kilian.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.014
Until they tie you down.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.099
Come on, cheer up.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.103
Father!

25:48.965 --> 25:51.425
Wow... Are we late?

25:51.509 --> 25:55.429
No, no. I was on the balcony
and when I saw you I came down.

25:56.973 --> 25:59.225
- You look great.
- Thank you.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.309
Well...

26:05.398 --> 26:07.942
You've chosen
a good time to leave, Dámaso.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.571
New found independence
from Kenya to Belgian Congo

26:11.654 --> 26:13.406
won't take long to reach Guinea.

26:14.282 --> 26:16.909
You're getting to know this country
in troubling times.

26:16.993 --> 26:19.161
I read on the boat
about the Mau Mau movement.

26:19.287 --> 26:22.665
Can you leave the conversation
of politics for another day, please?

26:24.750 --> 26:27.461
Tell me, Kilian,
how are Mariana and Catalina?

26:27.545 --> 26:29.755
- They miss us.
- Sure.

26:29.839 --> 26:32.717
I need you to help me convince
my father to take a holiday.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.385
Listen to your son, Antón.

26:34.468 --> 26:37.597
I can't even think how lonely
they must feel on their own.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.683
When the season is over.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.519
Stop making excuses
and decide on a date.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.521
You are a father
and a husband to them.

26:45.605 --> 26:48.024
It's not only
about sending money home.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.529
Looks like the food is
going down well, Jacobo.

26:54.322 --> 26:57.408
- Congratulations to the cook.
- Don't look at me.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.535
You've got her sitting in front of you.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.080
Julia.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.500
Excuse me for a second.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.588
Well...

27:10.671 --> 27:11.881
Excuse me.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.925
Julita.

27:15.468 --> 27:18.679
Mr Dámaso,
have you said goodbye to everyone?

27:19.680 --> 27:20.806
I believe so.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.559
But to everyone though?

27:23.643 --> 27:26.312
Because I know someone
who'll be very sad tonight.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.814
Like the rest of them will be too.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.234
You leave a footprint
wherever you tread.

27:32.318 --> 27:36.530
They mean Regina,
a friend of Dámaso's for many years.

27:37.448 --> 27:39.659
Doesn't he have
a wife and children in Spain?

27:39.742 --> 27:41.202
Spain is very far away.

27:42.036 --> 27:45.831
Let the man who is free of sin
cast the first stone, right, Father?

27:46.332 --> 27:48.668
If you stayed away
from women and drink,

27:48.793 --> 27:50.961
your health and wallet
would appreciate it.

27:51.045 --> 27:55.049
Not to mention your spirits. Mind
whose company you keep, young man.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.222
Thanks, Julia.

28:03.391 --> 28:05.511
If we haven't known each other
since we were children,

28:05.559 --> 28:07.687
I might think
I was making you nervous.

28:09.563 --> 28:12.858
No, it's my father.
I think he feels a bit down.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.319
Yes, I think so too.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.698
Massa Jacobo.
Massa Jacobo.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.533
What happens?

28:20.741 --> 28:23.536
Some men were having a party
in the barrack huts

28:23.661 --> 28:26.539
and suddenly a fight broke out
with machetes and all.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.749
We need someone
to handle the situation.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.627
There are injured people.
As it's Saturday

28:31.711 --> 28:35.297
there are no white people to put
things in order, not even the doctor.

28:35.381 --> 28:38.592
Damn! Mr. Emilio, Generosa...
Come on, Kilian. I'm really sorry.

28:38.676 --> 28:41.053
- We were having a great night.
- First things first.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.638
There will be other occasions.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.932
- Of course. Come on, Kilian.
- Hurry up.

28:45.015 --> 28:50.020
- Emilio will drive your father.
- Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

28:50.104 --> 28:52.356
- You take care.
- Take care, please.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.817
Wait. Thank you!
Good evening! Come on, Kilian.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.658
- Good job, Nelson.
- You're shameless.

29:03.534 --> 29:07.455
Welcome to Santa Isabel's nights.
We're on our way, Anita Guau!

29:13.794 --> 29:15.963
- Good evening, Jacobo!
- Hey!

29:16.046 --> 29:18.924
- Hello!
- Well look who's here.

29:19.008 --> 29:21.635
- We've missed you, Jacobo.
- Me too, darling.

29:21.719 --> 29:24.680
- This is my brother Kilian.
- Welcome. Enjoy!

29:24.764 --> 29:27.266
That's what we came for!
You already drunk?

29:27.349 --> 29:28.768
Look, look.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.562
Black label. The best whisky
and cheaper than beer.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.815
Advantages of being a free port.
The rest is nonsense.

29:34.899 --> 29:36.108
Come on, follow me.

29:59.048 --> 30:02.426
- Jacobo
- Anita Guau!

30:03.552 --> 30:05.262
Kilian, come on.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.770
Where are they from?

30:12.853 --> 30:18.150
Corisquenians, Nigerians, Fang
and Ndowé from the Muni river.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.985
- A bit of everything.
- And Bubis?

30:20.069 --> 30:23.280
Bubis no way. If they lose
their virginity they're punished.

30:23.364 --> 30:24.615
You mean...?

30:27.284 --> 30:29.537
Look, look, who's coming our way.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.998
Oba, Sade. Come sit at our table.

30:33.082 --> 30:34.667
Hello, guys!

30:38.587 --> 30:42.007
Where have you been?
I was missing you.

30:47.096 --> 30:49.849
Today we were told that some natives
have eaten a bishop.

30:49.932 --> 30:51.976
A sect or something.
Did you hear anything?

30:52.059 --> 30:55.062
You whites are so scared
of being eaten by us.

30:55.145 --> 30:58.315
But then you come here
to spend your money.

30:59.817 --> 31:01.235
The bishop is a monkey.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.366
Pao, any luck?

31:07.575 --> 31:09.368
She went off someone younger.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.163
I give up.
I'll just have to have another drink.

31:13.247 --> 31:14.874
Drink with us.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.266
Let's dance.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.138
Look at them.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.559
Don't mind them.
Just go with the flow.

32:47.591 --> 32:51.261
What's wrong?
Are you afraid that I'll eat you up?

33:19.540 --> 33:21.875
You want to join us?

33:38.517 --> 33:41.103
<i>April 24, 1954.</i>

33:42.062 --> 33:46.150
<i>Mother, Catalina,
we are working from dusk till dawn.</i>

33:46.275 --> 33:49.778
<i>The land here is so fertile that
we have to weed the fields every day</i>

33:49.862 --> 33:52.197
<i>so that the vegetation
doesn't invade the cocoa.</i>

33:53.574 --> 33:55.409
<i>Manuel always comes over
when he has some free time</i>

33:55.492 --> 33:56.952
<i>to study the local plant life.</i>

33:58.746 --> 34:00.205
<i>And on our days off,</i>

34:00.372 --> 34:03.834
<i>we tend to escape to Santa Isabel
with Dick and Pau, Jacobo's friends.</i>

34:08.714 --> 34:11.216
<i>I still haven't been able to make
friends with the natives.</i>

34:12.467 --> 34:13.969
<i>Even though I was born here,</i>

34:14.219 --> 34:16.513
<i>I feel that they see me
as just another outsider.</i>

34:17.806 --> 34:20.934
<i>Maybe this could change in time.</i>

34:21.851 --> 34:26.273
<i>Your son and brother who misses you,
Kilian de Rabaltué.</i>

35:44.143 --> 35:46.103
- Emilio.
- Kilian, how are you?

35:46.270 --> 35:47.271
- Gustavo?
- Kilian?

35:48.230 --> 35:50.816
Would you excuse me a second?
Sorry.

35:52.276 --> 35:53.277
Thank you.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.113
Are you expecting someone?

35:58.866 --> 36:00.033
Actually, I am.

36:00.951 --> 36:02.870
- Nelson.
- Nelson?

36:03.412 --> 36:07.166
I suppose he won't be long in
rescuing you from this boring party.

36:10.043 --> 36:12.421
What you're talking about?

36:12.963 --> 36:15.465
There was no fight at the estate.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.468
I can imagine where you
went off to in such a hurry.

36:21.013 --> 36:24.266
As far as I know, you're not my
girlfriend, you can't control me.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.191
Julia.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.359
Let's dance.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.925
Forgive me
for what happened the other day

36:58.008 --> 36:59.718
and for stepping on your toes.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.847
Don't worry. I'm not
the most gifted dancer either.

37:05.182 --> 37:09.061
And not as skilled as the miningas,
at least this dance is free.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.939
Julia, don't compare yourself with them.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.988
You guys can do as you please
and no one dares to judge you.

37:20.072 --> 37:23.116
We girls have to wait
until you get tired of flings

37:23.200 --> 37:27.704
and come back to get a good, loyal
wife, at home, locked up.

37:28.330 --> 37:31.333
Because you have a name for
women who behave as you do, right?

37:32.668 --> 37:34.086
All this is new to me.

37:34.586 --> 37:35.837
What would you think of me

37:35.921 --> 37:38.382
if I gave myself to anyone
I felt like every weekend?

37:38.465 --> 37:40.217
This conversation is
not appropriate for...

37:40.384 --> 37:41.426
For a woman.

37:46.807 --> 37:47.808
Julia.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.727
Wait a second, please.

37:51.812 --> 37:53.021
- Manuel.
- Yes?

37:54.606 --> 37:56.358
He's the estate's doctor.

37:56.692 --> 37:58.568
Julia is the daughter
of my parents' friends.

37:58.819 --> 37:59.819
A pleasure.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.863
Have we seen each other before?

38:03.282 --> 38:06.660
I often come here to swim
and on Sundays I'll play cards.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.540
That must be it, I usually come too.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.126
Do you want something to drink?

38:16.086 --> 38:17.546
- Thanks.
- No, thanks.

38:23.468 --> 38:27.014
I wasn't expecting this, Gustavo!
Enough!

38:27.097 --> 38:28.348
Emilio!

38:28.640 --> 38:31.393
I've sacrificed my whole life
on this land

38:31.685 --> 38:33.937
so that my family
could have a better life.

38:34.021 --> 38:36.273
I won't put up with being threatened!

38:36.356 --> 38:39.776
You've exploited us long enough!
Sooner or later you'll have to go!

38:39.860 --> 38:42.321
- Enough, Dad.
- Ungrateful, that's what you are!

38:42.404 --> 38:44.406
Enough!
Look at me. Enough.

38:45.115 --> 38:46.158
Please.

38:48.785 --> 38:52.539
Gustavo, forgive him.
He loves this island so much

38:52.622 --> 38:55.292
that he gets very upset
when they call him a foreigner.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.960
I hope you can see that.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.004
Forgive him, please.

39:01.340 --> 39:05.177
Dad, don't allow politics to damage
so many years of friendship.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.178
Come on.

39:08.597 --> 39:09.973
Listen to her.

39:10.057 --> 39:11.183
Please.

39:25.655 --> 39:28.033
Let's go home. Come on.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.326
Come on, Emilio.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.161
Dad, let's go home.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.622
She's a special girl.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.182
Not now, Simón.

39:55.102 --> 39:57.896
- Come on, wake up.
- What's wrong, Dad?

39:57.979 --> 39:59.523
The casino, Santa Isabel...

39:59.606 --> 40:02.818
You've been here for more than a
month and that's all you've seen.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.821
I won't let you waste your time
as your brother does. Get up.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.198
Come on, get up.
Osë is waiting for us.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.787
- Too much party last night?
- Not really.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.873
It's just...
I feel out of place.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.209
I miss my home.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.921
This is your home, Massa Kilian.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.808
It looks like we have arrived in time.

40:50.407 --> 40:51.491
It's a male.

40:52.284 --> 40:55.537
Once it leaves for the sea, it will never
again set foot on land.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.331
When the times comes, the female
turtles come back to this beach

40:58.498 --> 41:02.169
- to lay their eggs.
- How do they find their way back?

41:03.170 --> 41:05.213
One never forgets where one was born.

41:45.253 --> 41:48.507
Massa Antón, Massa Antón,
we want sweets!

41:48.632 --> 41:50.133
I don't have any.

42:00.769 --> 42:02.812
Hi, hi.

42:10.987 --> 42:14.491
Your father comes here from
time to time for our special oils.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.118
They're good for exhaustion.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.288
Come, I'll introduce you to my friends.

43:05.875 --> 43:09.713
I have a message for Massa Jacobo,
I have a message for Massa Jacobo.

43:10.422 --> 43:12.382
I have a message for Massa Jacobo.

43:13.049 --> 43:15.635
Hello,
I have a message for Massa Jacobo.

43:19.472 --> 43:22.684
- Can I help you, miss?
- Yes, I have a message...

43:24.769 --> 43:26.396
Why is everything so dark?

43:26.521 --> 43:29.566
An electricity problem.
Park just before you reach the house.

43:29.649 --> 43:32.193
The Nigerians
have filled the main courtyard.

43:32.277 --> 43:33.612
Thank you.

43:47.542 --> 43:50.045
- Remember the other day when...
- Wait. Marcial.

43:52.922 --> 43:53.923
Julia.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.510
Manuel, what's all this about?

43:57.594 --> 44:00.680
The laborers
have organized a forest rat hunt.

44:00.764 --> 44:04.684
- Hunting grompis? In the dark?
- There's a party in the courtyards.

44:04.809 --> 44:08.730
The jungle at night is full of
mystery. Do you want to have a look?

44:08.813 --> 44:09.898
Well, well.

44:11.024 --> 44:12.734
What are you doing here this late?

44:13.693 --> 44:15.737
I was going to the cinema and...

44:15.820 --> 44:16.821
To the cinema?

44:19.866 --> 44:21.785
You took a pretty big detour then?

44:21.951 --> 44:25.789
Yes, but I remembered on my way that
Manuel had invited me to the hunt.

44:28.541 --> 44:29.542
Shall we?

44:38.093 --> 44:40.720
- You want some?
- Thank you.

44:44.432 --> 44:46.518
- Cheers, Father.
- Hello.

44:48.728 --> 44:49.854
Kilian.

44:49.938 --> 44:51.481
Be careful!

44:58.571 --> 44:59.864
It's delicious.

45:02.701 --> 45:04.244
This is no place for a woman.

45:05.412 --> 45:07.580
Oh, Jacobo,
don't be so old-fashioned.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.542
You remind me
of Mariana when she was young.

45:14.421 --> 45:17.757
How's my daughter doing at hospital?
Does she give you much trouble?

45:17.841 --> 45:19.676
No, no!
She's a fast learner.

45:19.759 --> 45:22.262
I think it'll be easy
to persuade Garuz to hire her.

47:07.534 --> 47:09.661
How did this get into my bedroom?

47:10.787 --> 47:12.539
Who paid you to do it?

47:13.373 --> 47:14.499
Tell me!

47:15.250 --> 47:17.168
Who paid you, Simón?

47:18.294 --> 47:20.171
- I'm talking to you.
- Umaru!

47:20.839 --> 47:23.675
I saw Umaru coming down the stairs.
That's why I came to see you.

47:23.842 --> 47:25.677
Clean my bedroom! Now!

47:32.058 --> 47:34.227
Jacobo, Jacobo!

47:35.228 --> 47:36.646
- Umaru?
- He's there.

47:37.272 --> 47:39.524
Don't let him move!

47:42.235 --> 47:43.361
Don't move.

47:48.783 --> 47:50.285
What were you doing in my room?

47:51.911 --> 47:52.911
What is he saying?

47:53.872 --> 47:55.039
What is he saying?

47:55.123 --> 47:58.084
He says he's been at the party
the whole time.

48:04.173 --> 48:05.258
Bring me the rod.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.302
Bring me the rod!

48:07.385 --> 48:09.596
Father, let him do it.

48:10.805 --> 48:11.931
Hold him.

48:12.473 --> 48:13.516
You too, hold him.

48:14.183 --> 48:15.310
Hold him!

48:18.021 --> 48:19.105
Turn him around.

48:53.973 --> 48:57.810
That's enough, Massa. Stop.
The boy will tell you everything.

49:22.043 --> 49:25.254
He found a nest of bitis
in the cocoa trees.

49:25.380 --> 49:29.050
He called Massa Gregor so that
he could kill it but Massa Gregor...

49:31.803 --> 49:35.014
Congratulations.
You're now almost like me.

49:35.765 --> 49:37.392
You'll do well on the island.

50:02.125 --> 50:03.209
Kilian.

50:03.793 --> 50:05.169
Kilian. Father!

50:05.253 --> 50:08.631
Look at me. Look at me. Manuel!
Open your eyes, Kilian!

50:40.997 --> 50:41.998
Where am I?

50:43.624 --> 50:46.711
- Kilian, I didn't think you'd make it.
- What happened?

50:48.212 --> 50:50.757
What could it be?
The bitis bit you.

50:51.549 --> 50:54.093
But if you're awake
that means you're out of danger.

50:55.386 --> 50:56.804
You really scared us.

51:04.353 --> 51:05.855
Come on, men! Come on!

51:09.484 --> 51:14.781
<i>Mother, Catalina, I can't believe it,
but my first season has ended.</i>

51:17.825 --> 51:20.953
<i>Apparently it's one of the best
harvests they've had in years.</i>

51:25.500 --> 51:29.003
<i>Julia has become very good friends
with Manuel, the estate's doctor.</i>

51:30.046 --> 51:33.091
<i>I wouldn't be surprised
if we hear wedding bells any day now.</i>

51:34.801 --> 51:38.346
<i>By the way, Osë is taking father and
I to his daughter's wedding.</i>

51:39.305 --> 51:42.100
<i>I'll try to convince father
to take some vacation</i>

51:42.266 --> 51:44.519
<i>because I know
he really misses you two.</i>

51:46.687 --> 51:49.440
- What's your son-in-law called, Osë?
- Mosi.

51:50.066 --> 51:51.275
How did they fall in love?

51:54.445 --> 51:55.446
What did I say?

52:57.133 --> 53:00.094
He's telling her she must always
be faithful to her husband,

53:00.178 --> 53:03.472
like sand on the beach
that may only be washed by one sea.

53:04.807 --> 53:09.478
He wishes them happiness and strength
on their new journey.

53:14.025 --> 53:16.485
She's asking Mosi
to never abandon his wife

53:16.569 --> 53:19.071
in spite of the many other wives
he may have.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.325
How can you understand
their language, Father?

53:23.701 --> 53:25.578
I spend a lot of time with them.

53:25.786 --> 53:27.788
I've witnessed
many weddings like this one.

53:44.055 --> 53:47.850
May the spirits bless your marriage

53:47.934 --> 53:50.603
with many children.

53:50.728 --> 53:52.730
- What should I say?
- Whatever you want.

53:52.813 --> 53:55.942
Something sweet. She's been very kind
to me, and to you.

53:59.028 --> 54:01.364
I hope you'll both be very happy.

54:12.333 --> 54:13.918
Let's go.

54:33.938 --> 54:34.981
Massa Kilian!

54:39.360 --> 54:41.862
What's wrong?
What's wrong, Simón?

54:44.031 --> 54:45.116
It's Massa Antón.

54:57.169 --> 55:01.507
They found him passed out
in the office. He's sedated now.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.843
I've given him
a higher dose of morphine.

55:05.303 --> 55:06.304
Higher?

55:08.973 --> 55:12.184
For months now he's been taking
morphine to ease the pain.

55:14.061 --> 55:17.940
Kilian, your dad
has an illness that can't be cured.

55:19.025 --> 55:20.192
We can't operate.

55:22.737 --> 55:24.071
He only has a matter of days.

55:25.573 --> 55:26.574
I'm sorry.

55:29.076 --> 55:30.369
Did you know about this?

55:32.830 --> 55:33.873
Osë.

55:35.333 --> 55:37.460
He made me swear not to say anything.

55:40.046 --> 55:41.881
It's in God's hands now.

55:43.049 --> 55:44.759
God does not send the illness.

55:45.885 --> 55:48.637
God is the creator
of beautiful things.

55:49.138 --> 55:53.434
Illness is sent
by the spirits of our ancestors

55:53.517 --> 55:55.353
when we don't honor them
as we should.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.855
I don't know what the hell
you're doing in a hospital

55:58.064 --> 56:00.191
instead of in the jungle
invoking your spirits.

56:00.316 --> 56:01.359
Jacobo.

56:03.027 --> 56:05.613
What cannot be avoided,
cannot be avoided.

56:07.656 --> 56:10.242
Here, at least we can
help him with the pain.

57:01.877 --> 57:03.003
I feel useless.

57:03.462 --> 57:06.966
You take care of my father
in a way that I've never been taught.

57:07.508 --> 57:08.801
I don't even dare touch him.

57:11.220 --> 57:14.014
If it were your father on that bed,
what would you do?

57:18.769 --> 57:23.023
I'd let the doctor who has always
taken care of him come and visit him.

57:51.010 --> 57:52.011
Father.

57:54.305 --> 57:55.389
It's Kilian.

57:57.099 --> 58:00.102
I was walking in the snow
with my father.

58:01.729 --> 58:04.023
Soon I'll be back with my loved ones.

58:11.280 --> 58:13.115
If you were so ill,
why didn't you go home?

58:13.824 --> 58:16.660
- Do you remember the turtles?
- Yes.

58:16.744 --> 58:21.457
Once they leave for the sea,
they never again set foot on land.

58:22.958 --> 58:25.211
I have also chosen where I want to die.

58:27.129 --> 58:28.129
But mother...

58:29.298 --> 58:31.842
I didn't want her to see
my lifeless body.

58:32.593 --> 58:35.054
God has chosen me to go first.

58:37.056 --> 58:38.557
And I'm grateful.

58:40.684 --> 58:42.478
Is there anything
you want me to tell her?

58:44.980 --> 58:47.733
There's nothing
she doesn't already know.

58:48.817 --> 58:53.989
Well, yes. Tell her I'll be waiting
for her in the place where I'm going.

58:56.492 --> 58:58.869
I've seen that place
in my dreams, Kilian.

59:01.205 --> 59:03.749
That witch doctor opened my eyes.

59:10.589 --> 59:12.508
Life is a tornado.

59:14.176 --> 59:17.304
Peace, fury...

59:17.972 --> 59:19.932
and then peace again.

59:21.684 --> 59:22.851
Father.

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.181
Jacobo.

01:00:44.058 --> 01:00:45.059
Jacobo.

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:52.232
Jacobo, I know...

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.986
I know nothing I say
could ever console you,

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:59.073
but I want you to know
that I'm here if you need anything.

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:23.389
Don't you ever do that again!

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:26.475
I'm engaged to Manuel.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:28.894
But you don't love him.

01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:33.190
I spent half my life chasing you down

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:36.527
and you had to wait until Manuel
showed up to realise that I was here.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.447
You're going to ruin your life, Julia.

01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:42.282
I waited so long for you, Jacobo.

01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:45.619
It's time I started living.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:51.792
And you should do the same.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.341
Julia!

01:03:58.252 --> 01:03:59.753
I'm afraid I can't help you.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:03.549
My uncle has Alzheimer's and he's
no longer able to manage by himself.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.261
And my father passed away
a few days ago.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:08.345
I don't know...

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:11.431
If someone important
to them were having problems,

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.183
I couldn't forgive myself.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:19.606
If you could put me in contact with
Simón, I might be able to find them.

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:24.653
He was my uncle's houseboy
and the contact between my family...

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.282
And the woman mentioned
in the letter.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:32.160
Concerning the dates you mentioned,
I don't think he works here anymore.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:38.000
If you have a look at the files
that my father kept

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:40.377
you might find
what you're looking for.

01:05:27.716 --> 01:05:29.927
- Are you the new secretary?
- No.

01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:36.391
I'm looking for documents
from when my father worked here.

01:05:36.475 --> 01:05:38.310
You're the daughter of a colonist.

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:40.979
Employee of the estate,
it's not the same thing.

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:46.526
I see you haven't wasted any time.
Did you find anything interesting?

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.237
Not much really.

01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:53.659
I have to close up now, but if you
can come back another day.

01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:57.412
Iniko can take you
back to the hotel, right?

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:15.764
I'd always imagined this place
under a blazing sun.

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:18.642
That is because you know
nothing about this land.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:20.686
And the little I've heard is all lies.

01:06:20.769 --> 01:06:23.730
I heard Bubis were charming

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:25.232
and hospitable people.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:33.615
My hotel is that way.

01:06:33.824 --> 01:06:36.159
I have to pick someone up
from the airport.

01:06:36.243 --> 01:06:38.870
I'm late. I'll leave you
at the hotel afterwards.

01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:45.335
- Hi.
- Man, what's up?

01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:47.713
- How are you?
- Good.

01:06:47.796 --> 01:06:49.214
Good?

01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:51.925
- How's everything?
- Good.

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:03.437
- Hi, I'm Laha.
- Clarence.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.646
Nice to meet you.

01:07:05.439 --> 01:07:06.732
Do you want me to sit in the back?

01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:09.359
Don't worry, I'll go sit there.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:24.291
What are you doing in Malabo?
Let me guess...

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.793
- Volunteer for some NGO?
- No.

01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:30.881
- UN envoy sent to write up a report?
- No.

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:35.469
Businesswoman, engineer...
Iniko, give me a hint.

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:36.678
Researcher.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:39.264
No, I'm a professor of Linguistics.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:43.310
I'm here to look at the level
of Spanish spoken in Guinea.

01:07:43.894 --> 01:07:45.270
And how is it?

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:48.231
I don't know yet, I've just arrived.

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:52.611
- Are you on holiday?
- Yes and no.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.446
Let's see.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:56.448
I study Engineering in Madrid.

01:07:56.531 --> 01:08:00.577
We have a lot of oil and gas here but
it is extracted by foreign companies.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.660
Yeah.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:04.206
If more people
had the same opportunities as me...

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.088
Excuse my brother's manners.

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:12.923
Is he your brother?

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.509
- Didn't he tell you?
- No.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:18.720
He's not a big conversationalist.
Right, Iniko?

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.057
What are you up to tonight?

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:23.683
Nothing.

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:27.854
Would you accept some Bubi
hospitality to welcome you to Malabo?

01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:31.441
I'd be happy to.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.206
Well...

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.502
- You'll see, you're going to have fun.
- OK.

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.170
You're going to like it.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:54.548
I'm sorry.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.676
- Is there a problem?
- No.

01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.010
- No, I'm sorry.
- What?

01:08:59.094 --> 01:09:00.178
Let's go, Clarence.

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:09.062
You remind me of somebody.

01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:12.691
Someone I knew a long time ago.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:21.491
Be careful, you might find
what you have come here for.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.420
Who's that woman?

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.130
Mama Sade.

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:36.756
The man with her is her son.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.508
They say his father is a white man

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.844
she fell in love with,
and then he left her.

01:09:43.555 --> 01:09:46.850
- What is his son's name?
- What are you, a gossip?

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:50.060
They're dangerous people.
Don't get in trouble with them.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:54.316
Let's go.

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:58.945
Come on!
We will have a good time anyway.

01:10:58.255 --> 01:11:01.758
- Are you OK?
- Yes, thanks.

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.680
No, really.

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.015
Come on.

01:11:25.115 --> 01:11:27.242
This is better
than being in the hotel room.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:31.204
- Thanks for inviting me.
- I didn't invite you.

01:11:49.723 --> 01:11:51.808
Don't look so much. Listen.

01:11:52.434 --> 01:11:54.686
Feel the music...

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.146
here.

01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:00.483
Here.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.446
And here.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:24.341
See? It's not that difficult.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.250
What are you doing, Clarence?

01:13:35.662 --> 01:13:37.122
What are you thinking about?

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:40.667
I'm running out of time
and I haven't made any progress.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.253
Why did you come here?
Tell me the truth.

01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:46.256
My dad passed away a few days ago.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.175
I think he kept in touch
with someone here.

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:51.344
My grandfather died here.

01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:53.847
I visited his grave
and there were fresh flowers.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:56.516
Do you know a man called Simón

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:59.894
- who is now around 65 years old?
- No.

01:14:00.687 --> 01:14:02.730
Do you know his African name?

01:14:02.814 --> 01:14:03.898
No.

01:14:09.529 --> 01:14:10.905
Is that the Basile Peak?

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:13.950
It's actually a volcano.

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:17.287
In Bubi it's called Owässa.

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:21.875
The Nigerian called it Big Pico and
the British called it Clarence Peak.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:27.630
Did you know you were named
after an African volcano?

01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:29.340
An extinguished volcano.

01:14:29.424 --> 01:14:30.717
It's dormant.

01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:33.887
Only it knows how alive it is inside.

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:47.525
Where are we going?

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:50.653
It's a surprise.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.675
What are you waiting for?
Get out.

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:23.603
Come, it's this way.

01:15:39.494 --> 01:15:40.662
What do you think?

01:15:50.755 --> 01:15:56.052
Every December thousands of sea
turtles cross the Ocean Atlantic

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:59.389
to come here and lay their eggs,
the place where they were born.

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:00.557
Look.

01:16:14.821 --> 01:16:17.115
That is the guardian of the island.

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:20.243
It looks after the inhabitants of Ureka.

01:16:25.957 --> 01:16:27.792
An offering for the guardian.

01:17:05.163 --> 01:17:06.581
Come over here!

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:37.380
I was in prison, Black Beach.

01:18:40.258 --> 01:18:41.342
What got you arrested?

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:43.094
Being Bubi.

01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:46.305
They arrested hundreds.

01:18:47.432 --> 01:18:49.976
I was lucky
and was released from prison.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.103
Others didn't survive.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:56.858
There are still so many things
I don't understand about this place...

01:19:07.869 --> 01:19:10.663
My dad and uncle
probably saw these palm trees grow.

01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:19.088
One day there'll be nobody to tell
stories of palm trees in the snow.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.271
Look.

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:38.190
Hold this.

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:42.945
- You're not allowed to take photos.
- Garuz told me I can.

01:19:43.029 --> 01:19:44.614
Just a second.

01:19:47.867 --> 01:19:49.619
Taking pictures is forbidden!

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.037
We're leaving now.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:52.955
We're leaving now.

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:01.798
Put the camera away.

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.384
Let's leave before we get
into trouble.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.887
That man saw you
taking pictures. See?

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:11.182
- Maybe one of them knows Simón.
- Enough questions for today.

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:13.059
I should have started there.

01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:16.521
- Wait.
- Let me...

01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:20.733
Excuse me.
Excuse me, I'll put it away.

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:24.237
- I just want to ask something.
- White girl!

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.114
Go back to your country,
we don't want white people here.

01:20:27.198 --> 01:20:28.658
Keep walking.

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:29.826
Keep walking.

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:33.162
- Now you have foreigner friends?
- Fuck!

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:37.166
Come on.

01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:41.253
Enough.

01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:51.556
Let me talk to him.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:15.830
He says you have the eyes
of the people of your land.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.251
Everything is fine!
Everything is fine!

01:21:23.838 --> 01:21:25.172
Let me deal with them.

01:21:33.264 --> 01:21:34.264
Who is he?

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.353
He worked at the estate
when this was a Spanish colony.

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:42.899
Ask him if he's Simón.

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:49.530
Do you understand me?

01:21:51.324 --> 01:21:52.783
You speak my language.

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:56.037
He swore to never speak
your language again,

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.872
but yes, he understands you.

01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:00.791
Sometimes I'd prefer not to, though.

01:22:00.875 --> 01:22:01.875
What's he saying?

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:05.963
He's asking, what brings you here.

01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:13.846
My grandfather Antón, my father
Jacobo and my uncle Kilian

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:17.141
worked on this land for many years.

01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.186
My dad passed away a few days ago

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:23.898
and I came to visit my grandfather's
grave, Antón de Rabaltué.

01:22:26.025 --> 01:22:27.693
Did you know him?

01:22:35.952 --> 01:22:39.080
He says my grandfather
and yours were good friends.

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:53.302
He asks you to send
his regards to Massa Kilian

01:22:53.386 --> 01:22:55.554
and to tell him
that life hasn't been as cruel

01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:57.974
as it could have been,
in spite of everything.

01:22:59.976 --> 01:23:02.812
He says he will be glad to hear it.

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:05.982
Yes, he will be glad to hear it.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:14.323
What blood divided, blood will unite.

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:16.742
- Simón...
- Let's go.

01:23:16.826 --> 01:23:18.828
- I need to find Fernando.
- Let's go now!

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.121
I need...

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:31.674
Who's that Fernando
you're looking for?

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:36.512
My dad or my uncle used to send money
to a woman here in Bioko for years.

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:38.973
One of them had a son with her.

01:23:39.724 --> 01:23:41.392
I just know he is called Fernando.

01:23:45.563 --> 01:23:49.650
In those days, children were baptized with
a Spanish name and an African name.

01:23:49.734 --> 01:23:53.362
Fernando is a very common name,
but it's Laha's second name.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:02.204
Look.

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:13.299
- Where did you get that picture?
- I found it among my uncle's letters.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:15.259
That woman is my mother.

01:24:45.331 --> 01:24:47.666
I knew this day would come.

01:24:50.628 --> 01:24:51.754
Kilian...

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:57.635
We lived really hard times.

01:24:57.927 --> 01:25:01.013
Thanks to him, we could get by.

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:03.390
Surely, we wouldn't be here

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:05.184
without his help.

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:07.144
Mum.

01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:10.439
Kilian is my father?

01:25:14.068 --> 01:25:16.779
The spirits have decided
that the time has come

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:19.115
for my sons to know their story.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:21.742
The... The spirits?

01:25:21.826 --> 01:25:24.453
Didn't you heard their voice,
Clarence?

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:29.500
Why, if not, have you come to Bioko?

01:25:40.136 --> 01:25:45.015
My uncle stopped writing...
as soon as my grandfather passed.

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:47.852
This is my story, too.

01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:49.395
Please.

01:25:52.106 --> 01:25:55.609
Kilian went home and stayed there

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:57.153
for almost three years.

01:25:58.362 --> 01:26:00.990
In that time, many things changed.

01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:05.244
The gods blessed me with a child

01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:07.830
<i>and my life with Mosi became easier</i>

01:26:08.622 --> 01:26:10.416
<i>thanks to that gift.</i>

01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:23.012
I missed you, Grandfather.

01:26:26.599 --> 01:26:28.309
Come meet him.

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.853
Look!

01:26:33.022 --> 01:26:35.107
<i>But when Kilian came back</i>

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:38.694
<i>and we saw each other again...</i>

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:41.363
<i>it was like all that time</i>

01:26:41.447 --> 01:26:43.115
<i>that we had been apart...</i>

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.283
Congratulations.

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:45.910
<i>Had never existed.</i>

01:26:46.577 --> 01:26:48.120
What's his name?

01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:49.371
Iniko.

01:26:49.455 --> 01:26:53.083
Where you come from it means
"born in difficult times".

01:26:55.336 --> 01:26:56.462
May I?

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:02.426
I don't know your name yet.

01:27:04.845 --> 01:27:06.555
My name is Daniela Bisila.

01:27:07.932 --> 01:27:09.475
Congratulations, Mosi.

01:27:10.434 --> 01:27:11.727
Kilian!

01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:21.403
And to think
that I have the son of a Bubi chief

01:27:21.487 --> 01:27:24.281
- as my houseboy. Don't I, Simón?
- We'll see for how long.

01:27:24.365 --> 01:27:25.658
And what do you say, Osë?

01:27:25.741 --> 01:27:28.994
Do you want independence as well,
like Simón and Gustavo?

01:27:29.078 --> 01:27:32.248
When two elephants fight,
the one that suffers is the grass.

01:27:33.082 --> 01:27:35.417
That is all I know about politics.

01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:37.753
Let's go?

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:39.338
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Simón.

01:27:54.812 --> 01:27:57.815
What's wrong?
Aren't you happy to see me?

01:27:57.940 --> 01:27:59.316
Where is my brother?

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:03.237
Your brother is around, looking.
He likes all of them.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.073
On the other hand,
you are a one-woman man.

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:09.576
I've shared you with other men;
I owe you nothing.

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:13.080
That I make a living the way I do

01:28:13.163 --> 01:28:16.333
doesn't mean I don't have feelings.

01:28:21.255 --> 01:28:23.924
Oi! Show some respect!

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.722
Another round on me, damn it.

01:28:29.847 --> 01:28:32.141
Another round, my treat.
Money's not a problem.

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:36.145
Kilian.

01:28:39.732 --> 01:28:41.650
What are you doing here?
What's wrong?

01:28:41.734 --> 01:28:43.110
Catalina?

01:28:44.445 --> 01:28:45.529
Mother?

01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:48.490
No, they're good.
They send their love.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.162
Aren't you going to give me a hug?

01:28:54.038 --> 01:28:55.831
Of course I bloody will.

01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:02.880
Hey, I'm all right, yeah?

01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:05.090
I'm all right,
it's just that this season

01:29:05.174 --> 01:29:07.718
is turning out to be
a bit harder than expected.

01:29:12.348 --> 01:29:13.432
Stay where you are!

01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:16.435
Anybody gets close,
I'm gonna blow his brains out!

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:22.316
You better put the gun down.

01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:25.903
Put it down.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:28.655
Since when do we argue
over a woman here?

01:29:28.781 --> 01:29:30.157
Don't you understand

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.200
that you're not going
to decide for us ever again?

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:36.497
This is the real face of Whites!

01:29:37.331 --> 01:29:40.250
As long as you obey,
everything will be all right.

01:29:40.334 --> 01:29:41.794
Stand up!

01:29:46.382 --> 01:29:49.134
You don't have enough bullets
for everybody.

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:51.303
There's a lot more of us.

01:29:52.763 --> 01:29:54.181
Gregorio.

01:29:54.598 --> 01:29:56.600
Gregorio, put the gun down.

01:29:57.434 --> 01:29:59.395
Put the gun down.

01:29:59.478 --> 01:30:03.023
We'll let you go.
Nobody wants this to end badly.

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:12.825
Hand it over.

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:44.148
No ships come on Fridays.

01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:46.817
I came by plane at midday.

01:30:49.403 --> 01:30:51.572
And why didn't I see you?

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:56.952
When I got here, I was told
you were still at the cocoa fields.

01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:58.745
So I went to pay Osë a visit.

01:30:58.829 --> 01:31:02.124
When I came back, you had
already gone and they told me...

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:11.383
I've talked to Garuz.

01:31:11.508 --> 01:31:14.178
Now that I'm back, you'll be able
to go home for a few months.

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:19.224
It won't hurt you to get a bit
of rest and fresh air, Jacobo.

01:31:21.852 --> 01:31:24.396
I'm glad to see you too, Kilian.

01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:28.859
Very glad.

01:31:49.546 --> 01:31:52.466
That's it. They're leaving us
on our own. On our own!

01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.510
I was starting to think you
weren't around any more.

01:31:54.593 --> 01:31:55.260
No, dear.

01:31:55.427 --> 01:31:58.722
With things the way they are, I
thought you have left with Jacobo.

01:31:58.805 --> 01:32:00.474
He doesn't care about us.

01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:03.352
He's been in Pasolobino
almost nine months.

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:05.479
Isn't he coming back?

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:06.939
I don't know.

01:32:07.856 --> 01:32:09.608
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:11.026
- Hey, ma'am!
- Well!

01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:13.195
Not a single article about
what is happening here.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.197
Nobody cares about the colonies
back in Spain?

01:32:15.322 --> 01:32:16.323
To tell you the truth,
I don't think they do.

01:32:16.406 --> 01:32:18.867
Dad, France and England
have freed their colonies;

01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:20.554
Spain wasn't going to be
any different.

01:32:20.661 --> 01:32:22.579
Nobody knows their place any more.

01:32:26.625 --> 01:32:27.793
Here, give it to me.

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:29.670
Thank you, Generosa.

01:32:29.753 --> 01:32:31.088
And Manuel, how is he doing?

01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:33.757
- Good, he's really doing well.
- Yeah?

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.927
When he finishes at the plantation,
he goes to visit the villages,

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:39.555
so we don't get to relax.
But he's good.

01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:48.939
Julia? Julia!

01:32:50.232 --> 01:32:51.233
Julia.

01:32:51.358 --> 01:32:52.651
What's wrong?

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:54.653
It's Father Rafael.

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:57.406
He called the hospital;
he was really nervous.

01:32:57.489 --> 01:33:00.033
He says that a badly injured man
came to the church,

01:33:00.117 --> 01:33:02.995
says he's a friend of yours.
His name is Gustavo.

01:33:03.078 --> 01:33:05.038
Gustavo?

01:33:05.998 --> 01:33:08.709
But he was arrested months ago.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:13.797
We need to help him.
But Garuz can't find out.

01:33:14.548 --> 01:33:16.633
Kilian, could you take us?

01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:19.428
Let's go.

01:33:40.866 --> 01:33:42.117
Good afternoon.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.994
Where are you coming from?

01:33:44.077 --> 01:33:46.538
We were visiting Father Rafael.

01:33:46.622 --> 01:33:49.291
We're headed to Sampaka.
Is there a problem?

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:51.501
And her?

01:33:53.587 --> 01:33:57.090
She is the farm nurse. There's
a very ill man who we think will die.

01:33:57.174 --> 01:33:59.134
That's why we went
to tell Father Rafael,

01:33:59.259 --> 01:34:00.939
to see if he could give him
his last rites.

01:34:51.561 --> 01:34:54.231
It'd be best
if you didn't leave Sampaka.

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:08.745
Who did this to him?

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:12.374
Truth is, could have been anyone.

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:17.045
Spanish soldiers looking
to set an example or...

01:35:17.129 --> 01:35:20.841
Or some local leader who considers
him a dangerous opponent.

01:35:21.091 --> 01:35:22.551
Nobody is safe here any more.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:35.564
More bandages, please.

01:35:40.902 --> 01:35:42.404
What did you say to him?

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:46.366
That he looks so ugly the spirits
won't want to take him like this.

01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:48.952
When I'm finished with him,
he will be the one to decide

01:35:49.035 --> 01:35:50.370
if he wants to go or not.

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:03.341
Julia, go back home.

01:36:03.425 --> 01:36:05.260
I'll stay, don't worry.

01:36:05.844 --> 01:36:07.262
Are you sure?

01:36:09.181 --> 01:36:10.515
I'll be awake.

01:36:10.599 --> 01:36:13.351
Let me know when Bisila
has finished, please.

01:36:20.484 --> 01:36:21.902
Kilian.

01:36:38.835 --> 01:36:40.837
He will be safer here.

01:36:43.673 --> 01:36:45.217
You did a good job.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.928
Thank you. You helped, too.

01:36:48.053 --> 01:36:49.554
Anybody would have done the same.

01:36:49.846 --> 01:36:51.056
No.

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:53.183
Not anybody.

01:36:54.059 --> 01:36:55.519
Come.

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:26.967
You should get back.

01:37:30.512 --> 01:37:32.639
It is probably Manuel.

01:37:49.239 --> 01:37:50.615
It's late.

01:38:08.508 --> 01:38:09.801
Good evening.

01:38:09.926 --> 01:38:12.554
I'm sorry you had to take care
of this. How is he?

01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:14.973
Fine, he is resting now.

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.726
Well, you can go then,
I'll take it from here.

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:19.895
Thank very much, Bisila.

01:39:14.199 --> 01:39:17.077
I knew it the very first time
I heard your voice.

01:39:17.577 --> 01:39:22.832
As if you talked to a part of me I
didn't know it existed. Like a spell.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:25.293
What have you done to me, Bisila?

01:39:46.648 --> 01:39:48.733
My body is not untouched.

01:39:50.735 --> 01:39:52.529
But my heart is.

01:39:54.948 --> 01:39:56.616
I give it to you.

01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:31.002
What is that song about?

01:41:31.628 --> 01:41:33.421
The one you were singing
by the river.

01:41:35.507 --> 01:41:38.259
About springs that emerge
from the earth unexpectedly

01:41:38.384 --> 01:41:40.178
to become rivers.

01:41:41.471 --> 01:41:45.058
About streams
that split to rejoin again.

01:41:46.518 --> 01:41:50.688
About the sea that,
in the end, welcomes us all.

01:41:53.024 --> 01:41:55.318
It talks about life's path.

01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:57.862
About destiny.

01:41:58.905 --> 01:42:00.490
Why where you crying, then?

01:42:00.949 --> 01:42:01.949
Well...

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.953
Because I couldn't choose mine.

01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:12.085
As a child,
they told me horrific stories

01:42:12.335 --> 01:42:15.171
about punishing
adulterous women.

01:42:16.339 --> 01:42:21.010
They were strung up on trees,
stones tied to their feet.

01:42:21.094 --> 01:42:23.847
Or they were buried up
to their necks

01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:26.141
for the vermin to devour.

01:42:27.392 --> 01:42:29.561
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

01:42:38.987 --> 01:42:41.322
We will have to be very careful,
Kilian.

01:42:46.327 --> 01:42:47.954
It will be our secret.

01:42:50.415 --> 01:42:52.167
We can't hope for anything more.

01:42:54.085 --> 01:42:57.380
I will always be with you. Always.

01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:25.551
See you later!

01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:43.653
I'm running out of excuses to come.

01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:47.490
Yesterday, Simón asked me rudely
what was hurting me this time.

01:44:47.573 --> 01:44:49.033
Oh, yeah?

01:44:50.034 --> 01:44:52.662
And what did you tell him
was hurting you?

01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:04.549
It's not there that hurts.

01:45:04.757 --> 01:45:06.676
- No?
- No.

01:45:24.652 --> 01:45:26.112
You said it really well.

01:45:26.195 --> 01:45:27.655
- Really?
- Yes.

01:45:29.949 --> 01:45:31.868
Now it's my turn.

01:46:01.731 --> 01:46:04.150
Not even half as bad as I can be.

01:46:20.792 --> 01:46:23.211
Yeah, Fernando Poo
voted against independence,

01:46:23.294 --> 01:46:26.589
but it's a minimal margin.
It's just a matter of time, Kilian.

01:46:26.672 --> 01:46:28.508
Sooner or later, we'll need to
leave.

01:46:28.591 --> 01:46:31.052
Manuel, don't be a pessimist,
please.

01:46:31.219 --> 01:46:34.180
With Gustavo in the council,
we have a friend in the new party.

01:46:34.263 --> 01:46:36.766
- Don't we?
- I wouldn't be so sure about that.

01:46:36.849 --> 01:46:38.267
What do you think, Kilian?

01:46:39.143 --> 01:46:41.187
I don't care who's in power.

01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:43.606
I only hope things stay as they are.

01:46:44.816 --> 01:46:46.526
Right, Ismael? Aren't we OK here?

01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:48.069
Massa Kilian.

01:46:50.029 --> 01:46:51.656
What's the matter, Simón?

01:46:51.781 --> 01:46:53.825
A telegram arrived.

01:46:54.367 --> 01:46:56.160
It's not good news.

01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:04.001
What's wrong, Kilian? Is it Jacobo?

01:47:05.586 --> 01:47:07.171
It's Catalina.

01:47:08.089 --> 01:47:10.967
She's very ill.
They don't think she'll get better.

01:47:14.137 --> 01:47:17.306
They are asking me to go home,
to say goodbye.

01:48:44.227 --> 01:48:46.312
Dear Catalina...

01:48:48.439 --> 01:48:53.402
I stared at our house as if I
was trying to memorise every detail.

01:48:53.736 --> 01:48:57.865
Amá came close to me
and strongly grabbed my arm.

01:48:57.949 --> 01:49:00.284
<i>We struggled to walk forward,
arm-in-arm,</i>

01:49:00.368 --> 01:49:02.453
<i>with our suitcase and skies.</i>

01:49:03.538 --> 01:49:05.373
<i>The snow was up to our knees.</i>

01:49:05.998 --> 01:49:08.292
<i>It didn't take us long to reach
Jacobo.</i>

01:49:09.710 --> 01:49:11.170
<i>You were very cold.</i>

01:49:11.921 --> 01:49:13.381
<i>I warmed you up.</i>

01:49:13.839 --> 01:49:16.175
<i>We walked along the snowy streets.</i>

01:49:16.926 --> 01:49:19.136
<i>The mountain was full of snow.</i>

01:49:19.428 --> 01:49:21.389
<i>You were very sad.</i>

01:49:23.933 --> 01:49:28.771
<i>We were all fighting to hold back
our tears and control our emotions.</i>

01:49:30.314 --> 01:49:33.401
<i>It was then
that you gave me this diary.</i>

01:49:55.298 --> 01:49:57.091
Kilian!

01:49:57.258 --> 01:50:00.303
You have mail! From Africa!

01:50:28.164 --> 01:50:30.333
Have you gone crazy?

01:50:31.125 --> 01:50:32.251
This is a hospital!

01:50:32.376 --> 01:50:34.629
A hospital for workers of this
plantation!

01:50:36.047 --> 01:50:38.047
Don't stick your nose
into other people's business!

01:50:40.009 --> 01:50:42.428
- What happened?
- This was a warning!

01:50:52.647 --> 01:50:54.774
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:51:05.868 --> 01:51:07.286
How is your mother?

01:51:09.163 --> 01:51:11.415
I won't tell you that she's fine,
to be honest.

01:51:11.499 --> 01:51:15.461
But, since they saw it coming, she
had time to come to terms with it.

01:51:16.379 --> 01:51:18.923
At least Kilian is going to stay
with her for a while.

01:51:19.006 --> 01:51:20.508
And when will he come back?

01:51:23.010 --> 01:51:25.096
What, aren't you happy to see me?

01:51:26.931 --> 01:51:29.433
Don't be silly, Jacobo,
of course I'm happy.

01:51:31.977 --> 01:51:33.521
What?

01:51:34.063 --> 01:51:35.773
Nothing, it's just...

01:51:35.898 --> 01:51:40.152
It's just that it doesn't seem like
you to let others see you...

01:51:40.236 --> 01:51:41.904
vulnerable.

01:51:44.448 --> 01:51:46.367
I might be changing.

01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:53.499
You can't fool me, Jacobo.
I'm sorry, but you can't fool me.

01:51:54.458 --> 01:51:56.460
You will never change.

01:52:00.464 --> 01:52:02.425
I've met someone special.

01:52:04.802 --> 01:52:06.512
Her name is Carmen.

01:52:07.388 --> 01:52:09.765
You don't know her,
she's not from Pasolobino.

01:52:11.308 --> 01:52:13.853
Then I'm very happy for you. Truly.

01:52:15.104 --> 01:52:17.481
Although I can't say
the same for her, huh?

01:52:17.690 --> 01:52:19.942
She's got a lot in store for her,
poor girl.

01:52:25.406 --> 01:52:27.366
And how is it going with Manuel?

01:52:28.617 --> 01:52:30.578
Really well. He is a good husband.

01:52:30.661 --> 01:52:32.913
And look at me now,
with two little ones.

01:52:33.038 --> 01:52:35.624
Who would have said that
a couple of years ago, huh?

01:52:39.086 --> 01:52:40.963
I am very happy.

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:50.973
It's OK, it's OK.

01:52:51.265 --> 01:52:52.767
It's OK, it's OK.

01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:54.351
It's OK, baby.

01:52:54.435 --> 01:52:57.188
Well, I'd better leave you alone.

01:52:58.105 --> 01:52:59.857
It seems like the
little one is hungry.

01:53:11.118 --> 01:53:12.995
You can't fool me either, Julia.

01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:15.372
Leave.

01:54:50.843 --> 01:54:53.679
A young lady alone at this time?

01:54:53.762 --> 01:54:55.389
She's looking for something.

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.061
Let me pass. I'm a nurse, they're
waiting for me at the hospital.

01:56:35.447 --> 01:56:37.992
Stop, please.

01:56:40.619 --> 01:56:43.414
I'm sorry, I...

01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:45.708
It's not your fault, Clarence.

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:48.752
Nothing of what
happened is your fault.

01:56:50.546 --> 01:56:52.756
No one helped you?

01:57:02.641 --> 01:57:04.143
Bisila.

01:57:12.026 --> 01:57:15.946
Nobody can know.

01:57:16.030 --> 01:57:19.324
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

01:57:20.284 --> 01:57:22.786
It can't come to light.

01:57:23.412 --> 01:57:24.872
A strong tug.

01:57:24.955 --> 01:57:27.166
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

01:57:27.291 --> 01:57:30.669
Don't be afraid. You'll do it right.

01:58:09.792 --> 01:58:11.627
Stop, stop, stop.

01:58:26.892 --> 01:58:28.352
Kilian.

01:58:29.603 --> 01:58:30.729
Jacobo!

01:58:35.567 --> 01:58:36.985
Syphilis.

01:58:37.111 --> 01:58:39.696
How could he have caught syphilis,
Manuel?

01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:41.740
He will stay with us for three weeks,

01:58:41.824 --> 01:58:44.660
that's if he responds well
to the treatment.

01:58:44.743 --> 01:58:48.455
But he will need to be on medication
for at least three months.

01:58:50.916 --> 01:58:54.795
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have more things to do.

01:59:10.686 --> 01:59:11.812
Come on! Quick!

01:59:18.068 --> 01:59:20.362
Come on! Quick.
We don't have all day.

01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:43.385
What happened to you?

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.639
I was mowed down by a pick-up truck.

01:59:51.643 --> 01:59:53.854
My brother is very ill,
you've got to help him.

01:59:57.024 --> 01:59:59.443
I know perfectly well
what your brother has.

02:00:00.903 --> 02:00:02.821
I hope he dies.

02:00:02.905 --> 02:00:04.907
Bisila...

02:00:28.931 --> 02:00:30.807
Do you know them?

02:00:30.891 --> 02:00:33.936
Two white men murdered
the old-fashioned way.

02:00:34.519 --> 02:00:38.440
Now they'll say that it's the spirits
who don't want whites on the island.

02:00:38.523 --> 02:00:41.526
As if things weren't chaotic enough.

02:00:42.319 --> 02:00:43.779
Kilian.

02:00:43.862 --> 02:00:45.822
Tell your brother to be very careful.

02:01:18.105 --> 02:01:20.357
Is anybody going to tell me
what's going on?

02:01:27.447 --> 02:01:29.032
Simón.

02:01:30.951 --> 02:01:33.036
I thought we were friends.

02:01:34.997 --> 02:01:36.498
I don't understand anything.

02:01:36.665 --> 02:01:39.710
Truly. I know something happened
when I was in Pasolobino.

02:01:41.128 --> 02:01:43.380
Something that has to do
with Dick and Pao.

02:01:50.929 --> 02:01:52.389
My brother?

02:01:58.395 --> 02:01:59.771
Bisila...?

02:02:04.526 --> 02:02:06.486
Osë, tell me it's not true.

02:02:15.704 --> 02:02:16.872
Mosi knows.

02:02:17.914 --> 02:02:21.043
I told him I saw Dick,
Pao and Jacobo

02:02:21.209 --> 02:02:22.669
hanging around that night.

02:02:25.088 --> 02:02:27.382
Let Mosi do what he has to do.

02:02:27.507 --> 02:02:30.427
If you try to stop him,
he'll know about you and Bisila.

02:02:30.552 --> 02:02:33.889
And then you both will end up
hanging from a tree, too.

02:02:35.932 --> 02:02:38.518
If you really love her,
stay out of it.

02:02:59.581 --> 02:03:01.041
Well then!

02:03:07.464 --> 02:03:08.715
How are you doing?

02:03:13.178 --> 02:03:15.639
It's not contagious,
give me a hug, man.

02:03:15.722 --> 02:03:17.641
Haven't you heard?

02:03:19.184 --> 02:03:20.685
Dick and Pao.

02:03:20.852 --> 02:03:22.896
What, they caught
the same thing I did?

02:03:23.605 --> 02:03:25.941
They were found hanging from a tree.

02:03:27.567 --> 02:03:29.611
Because of something they did.

02:03:30.487 --> 02:03:32.406
Because of something you did, too.

02:03:35.992 --> 02:03:38.703
I drank so much I don't even know
how I woke up in my bed.

02:03:42.082 --> 02:03:44.501
Well, maybe I went too far
with the iboga as well...

02:03:44.793 --> 02:03:46.962
- What happened the other night?
- I'm trying to tell you,

02:03:47.045 --> 02:03:49.840
I can't remember, Kilian.
And it's none of your business.

02:03:49.923 --> 02:03:51.800
Do you even know who she was?

02:03:51.883 --> 02:03:53.593
What does it matter
which one she was?

02:03:53.677 --> 02:03:56.179
What's the problem,
that I left without paying?

02:04:50.525 --> 02:04:52.277
You raped a woman.

02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:53.945
You raped her!

02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:57.282
Osë's daughter, my woman.

02:04:57.365 --> 02:04:58.825
Jacobo, my woman!

02:05:04.998 --> 02:05:06.416
I should kill you myself.

02:05:06.541 --> 02:05:09.669
It'd be much less painful
than what Mosi can do to you.

02:05:10.962 --> 02:05:12.088
Kilian!

02:05:14.508 --> 02:05:15.759
Kilian!

02:05:35.028 --> 02:05:36.530
I need to speak to your father.

02:05:44.996 --> 02:05:48.542
What were you thinking, crossing
the forest at night on your own?

02:05:48.667 --> 02:05:51.670
You're my only friend here,
you need to help me.

02:05:54.214 --> 02:05:55.757
What is this?

02:05:56.758 --> 02:05:58.718
It's something I need to say.

02:06:19.364 --> 02:06:22.409
I know everything.

02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:25.579
I'm sorry.

02:06:28.331 --> 02:06:30.792
I'm asking you for forgiveness

02:06:31.835 --> 02:06:33.587
and from your ancestors

02:06:34.004 --> 02:06:35.922
in the name of my brother

02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:39.175
and my ancestors.

02:06:41.636 --> 02:06:43.305
I'm asking for forgiveness
from all women

02:06:46.099 --> 02:06:47.892
who have been humiliated

02:06:48.935 --> 02:06:50.520
by men such as myself.

02:06:52.272 --> 02:06:54.232
I promised

02:06:56.401 --> 02:06:58.778
to never abandon you.

02:07:00.989 --> 02:07:05.201
And I won't

02:07:05.952 --> 02:07:07.203
unless you

02:07:08.204 --> 02:07:10.123
ask me to.

02:07:16.254 --> 02:07:18.298
I need time, Kilian.

02:07:19.049 --> 02:07:20.508
We don't have it.

02:07:22.844 --> 02:07:23.928
Bisila.

02:07:26.681 --> 02:07:28.433
Tomorrow is Friday.

02:07:29.142 --> 02:07:31.811
Everybody will be
at Santa Isabel at night.

02:07:37.525 --> 02:07:39.569
This place will be empty.

02:08:08.348 --> 02:08:10.308
Want to go to Santa Isabel later?

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:14.896
Well, well, well,
what's with this banger?

02:08:16.564 --> 02:08:18.024
Stop, pull over there.

02:08:24.072 --> 02:08:25.490
What's wrong?

02:08:25.573 --> 02:08:27.409
I don't know anything about engines.

02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:38.586
Tell Maximiliano to send Waldo;
tell him to hurry up, come on.

02:08:39.587 --> 02:08:41.089
Let's go!

02:08:46.302 --> 02:08:47.512
Come on.

02:10:47.257 --> 02:10:48.716
Jacobo, it's me, Kilian.

02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:50.885
- Kilian!
- Calm down.

02:10:50.969 --> 02:10:53.137
Mosi is here, Kilian. Mosi...

02:10:58.601 --> 02:11:00.144
Kilian...

02:11:01.229 --> 02:11:02.897
Kilian.

02:11:11.364 --> 02:11:14.200
Whose is that? The gun.

02:11:14.284 --> 02:11:15.743
Gregorio.

02:11:51.487 --> 02:11:53.323
Get off my island.

02:12:03.458 --> 02:12:05.084
Hurry up.

02:12:11.633 --> 02:12:13.259
You're not going to come with me?

02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:15.595
Go.

02:12:16.930 --> 02:12:18.014
Hurry up.

02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:28.274
Kilian, look at me.

02:12:28.983 --> 02:12:30.777
Go back home.

02:12:31.486 --> 02:12:33.488
You've still got time
to start your life anew.

02:13:36.926 --> 02:13:38.302
Your hair.

02:13:41.139 --> 02:13:44.475
I've still got the images
in my mind, Kilian.

02:13:45.601 --> 02:13:47.353
I can't erase them.

02:13:51.482 --> 02:13:54.277
Mosi didn't have a family.

02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:56.070
Nobody's going to claim Iniko.

02:13:56.154 --> 02:13:57.780
I'm going to leave him
with my mother

02:13:57.864 --> 02:14:00.616
and I'll move to a cabin
in the outskirts of town.

02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:03.536
I'll need to be unseen for a while.

02:14:04.495 --> 02:14:06.122
Then I'll be able to come out

02:14:06.289 --> 02:14:09.167
and I'll be free to go
and do whatever I want to.

02:14:10.501 --> 02:14:13.421
I need you to promise
that you won't try to see me.

02:14:20.011 --> 02:14:21.512
How long?

02:14:22.805 --> 02:14:24.640
A year.

02:14:25.516 --> 02:14:28.227
The time it takes
a cocoa tree to bloom.

02:14:29.312 --> 02:14:32.356
We don't have that much time,
you know that as well as I do.

02:14:34.692 --> 02:14:36.319
Kilian...

02:14:37.278 --> 02:14:39.322
I've said this once and
I say it again.

02:14:41.282 --> 02:14:43.409
I will always be by your side.

02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:50.958
Even though you can't see me,
I'll be there.

02:15:39.173 --> 02:15:42.051
<i>A low shot that just sneaks
by the post.</i>

02:15:46.889 --> 02:15:51.686
<i>Coming up next, the president
gives his first speech to the people.</i>

02:15:51.769 --> 02:15:57.024
<i>I declare formally constituted
the Republic of Equatorial Guinea</i>

02:15:57.108 --> 02:16:00.111
<i>of which I become
its first constitutional president.</i>

02:16:01.070 --> 02:16:04.866
<i>- Long live the Republic of Equatorial Guinea!
- Long live the Republic!</i>

02:17:07.969 --> 02:17:09.388
Kilian, any news on Gregorio?

02:17:09.555 --> 02:17:10.555
No.

02:17:10.848 --> 02:17:12.516
I thought maybe he'd gone back to
Spain without saying anything,

02:17:12.642 --> 02:17:14.894
but all of his things
are still in his bedroom.

02:17:15.519 --> 02:17:17.188
Including his passport.

02:17:18.147 --> 02:17:19.565
I don't know anything about him.

02:17:20.316 --> 02:17:23.152
I don't have the power
to protect the Spaniards any more.

02:17:29.116 --> 02:17:30.368
Be careful, Kilian.

02:17:45.549 --> 02:17:47.009
Hey, friend!

02:17:47.093 --> 02:17:50.388
You look tired,
why don't you hop in?

02:17:51.222 --> 02:17:52.807
I prefer walking.

02:18:02.066 --> 02:18:03.066
Get in.

02:18:08.698 --> 02:18:12.075
I think that will be enough.
You can rest now.

02:18:13.119 --> 02:18:15.705
That grave should be for your
brother.

02:18:15.788 --> 02:18:18.833
So you're going to pay for him.

02:18:20.209 --> 02:18:22.670
Why didn't you leave as well?

02:18:23.879 --> 02:18:25.589
I should return this to you.

02:18:26.841 --> 02:18:29.302
You white people
are nothing without them.

02:18:46.943 --> 02:18:48.529
Have you all gone crazy?

02:18:51.281 --> 02:18:53.200
This man is innocent.

02:18:53.367 --> 02:18:56.329
He didn't respect our laws.

02:18:56.412 --> 02:18:57.746
That's not true.

02:18:57.871 --> 02:18:59.415
You know he didn't rape Bisila.

02:18:59.498 --> 02:19:01.375
She loves him.

02:19:02.209 --> 02:19:04.378
She is mourning

02:19:04.462 --> 02:19:06.922
to be able to reunite with him.

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:09.924
Jacobo snatched Bisila's
"ribalá rèötö".

02:19:10.009 --> 02:19:12.178
And now you will take

02:19:12.261 --> 02:19:14.555
his "ribalá rè rihólè"?

02:19:23.439 --> 02:19:26.025
I'll give you time until Bisila's
has finished mourning.

02:19:26.233 --> 02:19:27.985
Then, you both will have to leave.

02:19:28.361 --> 02:19:30.487
If not, you know what to expect.

02:19:41.499 --> 02:19:43.501
Simón, please,
fetch me that paper over there.

02:19:49.048 --> 02:19:51.258
You know what that is?

02:19:51.342 --> 02:19:52.551
It's an "elëbó".

02:19:54.595 --> 02:19:56.764
It keeps bad spirits away.

02:19:58.224 --> 02:20:00.726
Bisila sent it to me when
I was away.

02:20:05.606 --> 02:20:07.358
I'd like to ask you a favour.

02:20:44.562 --> 02:20:47.106
There's no need for you
to do the natives' work.

02:20:47.982 --> 02:20:49.483
I sleep better if I'm tired.

02:20:55.698 --> 02:20:57.908
First time
I saw you at the cocoa plantations

02:20:58.033 --> 02:21:00.578
you looked lost,
not really knowing what to do.

02:21:01.662 --> 02:21:05.291
You asked: "What are the songs
about?", and I told you...

02:21:05.374 --> 02:21:06.792
"About work".

02:21:06.876 --> 02:21:09.587
Work to keep you from thinking.
Now I understand.

02:21:11.130 --> 02:21:13.674
Some of these men spend years
without seeing their wives.

02:21:14.925 --> 02:21:16.802
Now I'm just one more among them.

02:21:34.612 --> 02:21:36.947
I was just a girl when
I arrived here.

02:21:38.365 --> 02:21:39.450
This is my home.

02:21:41.285 --> 02:21:43.496
It's the only one I've ever known.

02:21:43.746 --> 02:21:46.874
If you don't see me cry, it's because
Iran out of tears a long time ago.

02:21:47.708 --> 02:21:50.503
On the other hand... I understand
why you don't want to come back,

02:21:50.669 --> 02:21:52.296
but it's dangerous here.

02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:56.175
Father Rafael is leaving too.

02:21:56.258 --> 02:22:00.429
Even Nelson and Oba have realised
that this isn't a safe place to live.

02:22:00.763 --> 02:22:02.556
You're not going to change my mind.

02:22:03.015 --> 02:22:04.725
I made a promise, Julia.

02:22:09.563 --> 02:22:13.692
I know, I know... Honestly,
I didn't call you to persuade you.

02:22:16.195 --> 02:22:17.988
I called to ask you a question.

02:22:19.198 --> 02:22:22.451
Would you change your mind if she
would be willing to come with us?

02:22:25.287 --> 02:22:26.287
Ma'am.

02:22:26.747 --> 02:22:27.831
They are here.

02:22:35.256 --> 02:22:36.507
Wait a minute.

02:22:55.401 --> 02:22:56.402
Iniko!

02:23:14.628 --> 02:23:16.046
He's precious.

02:23:37.151 --> 02:23:39.361
Hello, Bisila.

02:23:42.781 --> 02:23:44.241
How are you?

02:23:48.537 --> 02:23:50.914
His name is Fernando Laha.

02:23:52.958 --> 02:23:54.543
May I?

02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:05.054
It'll be our secret.

02:24:07.389 --> 02:24:10.851
His future siblings
won't notice the difference.

02:24:11.852 --> 02:24:14.605
I won't be able to have more
children.

02:24:17.107 --> 02:24:18.859
Two is enough.

02:24:20.069 --> 02:24:22.988
If you want, nothing can stop us
from being a family.

02:24:23.989 --> 02:24:25.449
I want that.

02:24:59.775 --> 02:25:01.068
Wait a moment.

02:25:02.653 --> 02:25:04.822
Sorry.

02:25:07.825 --> 02:25:10.035
Sorry. Excuse me.

02:25:10.119 --> 02:25:11.620
Bisila.

02:25:11.787 --> 02:25:13.664
Julia!

02:25:14.289 --> 02:25:15.874
Kilian.

02:25:17.918 --> 02:25:19.336
I'll see you in a minute.

02:25:29.722 --> 02:25:31.432
Thank you very much.

02:25:32.891 --> 02:25:34.393
What's the matter?

02:25:34.476 --> 02:25:36.145
You are Guinean, you cannot leave.

02:25:38.856 --> 02:25:40.441
This woman is my wife.

02:25:40.524 --> 02:25:42.234
- Show me the papers.
- Father!

02:25:42.317 --> 02:25:43.777
The papers.

02:25:43.861 --> 02:25:46.029
I'm Father Rafael,
the priest of St. Isabel.

02:25:46.196 --> 02:25:48.949
Their papers were lost in a fire
during the riots.

02:25:49.116 --> 02:25:52.161
I married them,
she's as Spanish as we are.

02:25:52.244 --> 02:25:57.416
Children of a Spaniard and a Guinean
are Guinean, not Spanish.

02:25:59.418 --> 02:26:00.919
They cannot travel.

02:26:01.003 --> 02:26:03.088
This woman is Spanish, not Guinean.

02:26:03.255 --> 02:26:06.133
She's free to go aboard,
but this child is Guinean,

02:26:06.216 --> 02:26:07.593
and so is the mulatto.

02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:11.096
They don't leave. You decide
whether you leave or you stay.

02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:12.598
You'd better get on the ship.

02:26:12.765 --> 02:26:15.100
When we get to Spain,
we'll fix it at the embassy.

02:26:15.184 --> 02:26:17.644
They're my family,
I'm not leaving without them.

02:26:17.728 --> 02:26:21.106
Then clear the way!
Get out of here! Get out!

02:26:22.399 --> 02:26:23.942
You, pass.

02:26:24.610 --> 02:26:26.069
Go, come on!

02:26:26.153 --> 02:26:28.197
Get up, get up. Are you OK?

02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:29.406
Bisila, are you OK?

02:26:29.573 --> 02:26:30.824
Don't move!
Get back!

02:26:31.575 --> 02:26:33.285
- Close the doors.
- Let's go!

02:26:33.952 --> 02:26:35.412
- Come on, let's go!
- Close!

02:26:35.913 --> 02:26:36.914
Get back!

02:26:39.458 --> 02:26:40.584
Get back!

02:26:46.215 --> 02:26:47.341
Come on! Come on!

02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:56.850
Go, go, go, go!

02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:04.024
Kilian!

02:27:16.537 --> 02:27:18.789
Kilian! Kilian!

02:27:18.872 --> 02:27:20.833
- Kilian!
- Sit down!

02:27:21.250 --> 02:27:23.126
Oba! Kilian!

02:27:32.678 --> 02:27:33.846
Nelson... Help!

02:27:34.805 --> 02:27:36.056
Please!

02:27:36.390 --> 02:27:38.058
Nelson!

02:27:45.232 --> 02:27:46.733
Let's go.

02:27:48.735 --> 02:27:51.864
Kilian! Kilian!

02:27:57.578 --> 02:27:59.997
Sooner or later,
they'll come back for us.

02:28:02.207 --> 02:28:04.751
They won't allow us to live
together.

02:28:06.879 --> 02:28:09.339
Maybe they won't let us live
together...

02:28:09.965 --> 02:28:12.926
But they won't be able
to separate us, either.

02:29:14.029 --> 02:29:15.489
Can I now?

02:29:15.572 --> 02:29:17.199
No, not yet.

02:29:21.828 --> 02:29:23.664
Now you can.

02:29:34.049 --> 02:29:36.635
Your turn, undress yourself.

02:29:53.694 --> 02:29:57.572
We have two kinds of marriage.

02:29:58.824 --> 02:30:03.453
"Ribalá rèötö", the kind
that buys virginity.

02:30:04.121 --> 02:30:06.623
It's the one that bonded me to Mosi.

02:30:07.541 --> 02:30:11.920
But we also have "ribalá rè rihólè".

02:30:13.755 --> 02:30:15.549
Marriage based on love.

02:30:17.634 --> 02:30:19.469
It's not valid before the law.

02:30:21.304 --> 02:30:23.598
But it is between us.

02:30:28.854 --> 02:30:33.734
We don't have a priestess, but the
keeper of island can be our witness.

02:30:36.778 --> 02:30:38.864
If that's what you want.

02:30:43.118 --> 02:30:44.828
It's what I want.

02:30:52.210 --> 02:30:54.671
Then I must talk first.

02:30:58.925 --> 02:31:00.635
I promise

02:31:01.678 --> 02:31:05.098
that I will always be faithful to you

02:31:07.684 --> 02:31:10.020
in my heart.

02:31:14.274 --> 02:31:16.234
What should I say?

02:31:16.318 --> 02:31:20.655
You need to say
that you won't abandon this wife.

02:31:20.739 --> 02:31:23.617
Despite the many others
that you may have.

02:31:26.036 --> 02:31:28.330
I won't leave you, no matter what.

02:31:34.044 --> 02:31:36.463
In my heart, at least.

02:31:42.719 --> 02:31:47.474
All around us,
the world was falling apart...

02:31:47.557 --> 02:31:52.229
But in Bisappoo,
we could finally live our love freely.

02:31:54.064 --> 02:31:57.067
And that was
the only thing that mattered.

02:31:58.819 --> 02:32:03.365
We didn't know
how long happiness could last.

02:32:04.658 --> 02:32:06.409
It wasn't long.

02:32:07.869 --> 02:32:10.497
Bisappoo would burn soon.

02:32:11.206 --> 02:32:14.501
All the Spaniards
had to leave the island...

02:32:14.584 --> 02:32:16.419
due to Macías' decree

02:32:18.755 --> 02:32:20.465
and not be able to return.

02:32:22.092 --> 02:32:27.013
Nevertheless, those were
the happiest days of my life.

02:32:27.389 --> 02:32:30.308
Enough to give meaning

02:32:31.935 --> 02:32:33.603
to an entire lifetime.

02:33:02.632 --> 02:33:04.134
Bisila...

02:33:07.971 --> 02:33:11.766
She gave me another present for you,
Uncle Kilian.

02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:14.436
I hope I can do it right.

02:33:15.896 --> 02:33:18.398
I learnt it just like she taught me.
