WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:06.240
THANK GOD. WHAT HAPPENED?

00:06.240 --> 00:07.875
A KID IN HIS CLASS
BROUGHT A GUN TO SCHOOL

00:07.875 --> 00:09.009
AND STARTED SHOOTING.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.478
ONE KID WAS GRAZED
ON THE ARM

00:10.478 --> 00:12.580
AND THEN SECURITY TACKLED
THE KID WITH THE GUN.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.014
MAX!

00:14.014 --> 00:15.449
THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS

00:15.449 --> 00:17.518
I DON'T LIKE
ABOUT THIS COUNTRY--

00:17.518 --> 00:21.222
YOU SETTLE YOUR PROBLEMS
WITH GUNS.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.056
I MEAN, I REMEMBER
GROWING UP IN CUBA--

00:22.056 --> 00:23.357
NOT NOW, VIC.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.359
IF WE HAD A PROBLEM
WITH A BOY AT SCHOOL,

00:25.359 --> 00:28.062
WE WOULD CHASE HIM AROUND
WITH A STICK.

00:28.062 --> 00:32.333
WEEKS LATER, HE WOULD SHOW UP
ENRAGED WITH HIS OWN STICK,

00:32.333 --> 00:36.070
BUT WE JUST HELD HIM DOWN
AND, UM, BEAT HIM AGAIN.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.640
WISH I HAD A STICK
RIGHT NOW.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.710
YOU OKAY?

00:42.710 --> 00:43.911
YEAH, I'M COOL.

00:43.911 --> 00:46.080
DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.615
I HEARD A COUPLE OF POPS

00:47.615 --> 00:49.483
AND THEN THIS ONE KID
GRABBED HIS ARM.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.552
OH, GOD. YOU MUST
HAVE BEEN TERRIFIED.

00:51.552 --> 00:55.089
NAH, I SEEN WORSE WHEN I PLAY
MY VIDEO GAME "CARJACKER 3."

00:55.089 --> 00:57.458
YESTERDAY, THIS SOCCER MOM
GOT BLOWN AWAY

00:57.458 --> 00:59.527
'CAUSE SHE WOULDN'T GIVE UP
HER S.U.V.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.495
WHAT?!

01:01.495 --> 01:04.232
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT,
BUT I NEEDED THE POINTS.

01:07.034 --> 01:10.003
HONEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
HIDE IT.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.739
IT'S OKAY TO BE SCARED.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.808
I'M NOT SCARED.
I'M GONNA GO DO MY HOMEWORK.

01:19.547 --> 01:23.651
OKAY, OUR SON
IS COMPLETELY DESENSITIZED.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.653
IT'S LIKE THE SHOOTING
DIDN'T EVEN AFFECT HIM.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.054
ARE YOU CRAZY?!

01:27.054 --> 01:29.690
WHAT, WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE HIM
ALL SHAKING AND CRYING?!

01:29.690 --> 01:33.394
HE'S DEALING WITH THINGS
THE LOPEZ WAY.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.529
AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.398
BY NOT DEALING WITH IT.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.033
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.869
HEY, THAT'S HOW I HANDLED THINGS
WHEN I WAS A KID, ANGIE.

01:41.869 --> 01:46.073
WHEN SOMETHING WAS TOO HORRIBLE,
I BLOCKED IT OUT.

01:46.073 --> 01:47.308
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 3,

01:47.308 --> 01:49.643
I WALKED INTO
MY MOM'S BEDROOM...

01:49.643 --> 01:51.078
THEN I REMEMBER MEETING YOU
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

01:51.078 --> 01:52.213
NOTHING IN BETWEEN.

01:54.148 --> 01:57.485
THE RIGHT WAY
TO DEAL WITH THIS

01:57.485 --> 01:59.420
IS TO PROCESS
YOUR OWN EMOTIONS.

01:59.420 --> 02:04.358
THAT WAY, YOU CONTROL THEM
AND THEY DON'T CONTROL YOU.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.796
GEORGE?

02:11.265 --> 02:13.734
OH, I'M SORRY.
I BLOCKED IT OUT.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.741
WELL, I THINK IF OUR SON DOESN'T
REACT TO A SCHOOL SHOOTING,

02:20.741 --> 02:23.444
WE HAVE GOT A PROBLEM
ON OUR HANDS.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.447
WELL, I DON'T SEE IT, BUT I'LL
STAY HERE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

02:26.447 --> 02:28.316
TO MAKE SURE MAX IS OKAY.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.883
WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT LIVING HERE?

02:29.883 --> 02:31.452
I'VE BEEN STAYIN' AT ERNIE'S

02:31.452 --> 02:35.556
BECAUSE I CAN'T LIVE
IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER!

02:35.556 --> 02:38.292
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE WAS EMASCULATING YOU.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.832
HOW COULD I EMASCULATE HIM?

02:44.832 --> 02:48.736
CAN'T PICK BERRIES
IF THERE'S NOTHING ON THE VINE.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.874
I GOT BERRIES!

02:53.874 --> 02:56.577
WHY'D YOU RUN AWAY
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL THEN?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.178
I DIDN'T RUN AWAY.
I TOOK A STAND,

02:58.178 --> 03:02.516
AND AS SOON AS I KNOW MAX IS
ALL RIGHT, I'M OUTTA HERE.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.923
OUR SON JUST WITNESSED
A SHOOTING.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.626
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
HE MIGHT BE IN SHOCK.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.229
CAN YOU TWO PLEASE PUT
YOUR PETTY DIFFERENCES ASIDE

03:15.229 --> 03:16.930
AND BEHAVE LIKE ADULTS?

03:16.930 --> 03:20.133
WELL, I CAN DO THAT FOR MY SON,
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.935
I CAN DO IT BETTER
THAN YOU CAN!

03:21.935 --> 03:23.904
YOU ALWAYS THINK YOU CAN DO
THINGS BETTER THAN ME!
AND I CAN!

03:23.904 --> 03:28.509
WHAT ABOUT YOU?! YOU CAN'T
EVEN PUT ON YOUR EYELINER!

03:30.278 --> 03:31.879
I THINK WE GOT THIS.

03:36.450 --> 03:41.555
MAN, ANGIE, IT'S NICE
TO BE BACK IN MY OWN BED.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.923
YOU KNOW,
THAT SCHOOL SHOOTING TODAY

03:42.923 --> 03:44.625
MADE ME THINK ABOUT
HOW PRECIOUS LIFE IS

03:44.625 --> 03:46.594
AND HOW WE ONLY HAVE
EACH OTHER.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.496
NO SEX.

03:48.496 --> 03:51.031
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

03:51.031 --> 03:54.101
YOU THINK I'M THAT SHALLOW?
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.069
I'M SORRY.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.705
THAT'S OKAY.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.239
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO MAKE IT UP TO ME--

03:59.239 --> 04:01.942
YOU SMELL SO GOOD!
NO!

04:01.942 --> 04:05.513
I'M WORRIED ABOUT MAX.
HE'S NOT GONNA HEAR ANYTHING!

04:05.513 --> 04:08.048
THAT GUNSHOT'S
STILL RINGING IN HIS HEAD!

04:08.048 --> 04:10.718
I TALKED TO SOME
OF THE OTHER PARENTS.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.587
THE SCHOOL IS BRINGING IN
A TRAUMA COUNSELOR.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.623
ANGIE, MAX DOESN'T NEED
A TRAUMA COUNSELOR.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.257
I NEVER WENT TO COUNSELING,

04:17.257 --> 04:20.227
AND I SAW MY MOM
STAB A REPO MAN.

04:20.227 --> 04:23.964
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON MAX.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.466
HE'S FINE. HE'S SLEEPING.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.234
I JUST HAVE TO SEE.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.303
AFTER THAT, WILL YOU COME
BACK TO BED AND RELAX?

04:29.303 --> 04:30.971
YES.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.960
MAX HAD A NIGHTMARE
AND HE WET THE BED.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.829
WE ARE TAKING HIM
TO COUNSELING TOMORROW.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.865
OKAY.

04:57.865 --> 05:01.635
HE NEEDS US RIGHT NOW.
COME ON.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.672
OKAY.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.275
ARE YOU NAKED UNDER THERE?

05:08.275 --> 05:09.610
NO!

05:09.610 --> 05:11.211
WHY ARE YOUR PAJAMAS
ON THE FLOOR?

05:11.211 --> 05:13.213
WHY ARE KIDS SHOOTING KIDS?!

05:13.213 --> 05:15.549
NOTHING
MAKES ANY SENSE ANYMORE!

05:15.549 --> 05:18.786
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

05:22.356 --> 05:25.058
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:25.058 --> 05:26.427
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

05:38.972 --> 05:41.642
ALL RIGHT, THERE ARE SHEETS
WITH PEE ON THEM

05:41.642 --> 05:43.611
IN THE WASHING MACHINE.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.946
WHY CAN'T GRANDMA
DO HER OWN LAUNDRY?

05:48.782 --> 05:51.519
SHOOT. I FORGOT TO START
THE MACHINE LAST NIGHT.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.622
CARMEN, THOSE AREN'T
GRANDMA'S SHEETS.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.956
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING,

05:55.956 --> 05:58.158
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE FUN OF YOUR BROTHER.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.728
HE WET THE BED?

06:00.728 --> 06:03.831
YOU DO NOT SAY A WORD TO HIM
ABOUT THIS.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.599
MOM, I'M NOT GOING TO
SAY ANYTHING,

06:05.599 --> 06:08.135
BUT SOMEONE'S GETTING DIAPERS
FOR CHRISTMAS.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.740
YOU KNOW, I WENT THROUGH
THE SAME THING WITH GEORGE.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.544
HEY, GEORGE, REMEMBER
WHEN YOU USED TO WET THE BED?

06:16.544 --> 06:20.013
IT WAS THE ONLY HOT WATER
WE HAD.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.752
JEEZ, THE DAY I BROUGHT
YOU HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL,

06:24.752 --> 06:27.588
YOU STARTED CRYING
AND YOU HAVEN'T STOPPED!

06:27.588 --> 06:30.724
WELL, YOU'D BE CRYING, TOO,
IF YOU WERE SNUCK OUT

06:30.724 --> 06:34.762
IN YOUR MOM'S PURSE BECAUSE
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO PAY THE BILL.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.697
I WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD
CHARGE ME MORE

06:36.697 --> 06:39.833
BECAUSE YOUR HEAD
WAS THE SIZE OF TWO BABIES!

06:39.833 --> 06:43.270
STOP IT!

06:43.270 --> 06:44.872
THAT'S ENOUGH.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.641
WELL, I STILL SAY
I'M BAD AT MATH

06:47.641 --> 06:50.744
BECAUSE YOUR LIPSTICK
POKED ME IN MY SOFT SPOT.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.749
MAX, HOW DO YOU FEEL?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.685
I COULDN'T GET BACK
TO SLEEP.

06:57.685 --> 07:01.121
WELL, THE SHOOTING
AFFECTED YOU IN WAYS

07:01.121 --> 07:02.823
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.157
I THINK IF YOU TALKED
TO THE COUNSELOR AT SCHOOL,

07:04.157 --> 07:05.659
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.961
OH, MAN, I DON'T WANNA
GO SEE THE COUNSELOR.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.599
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
TELL HIM I... WET THE BED.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.233
YOU DON'T HAVE TO, HONEY.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.970
I ALREADY TOLD HIM ON THE PHONE.
HE'S ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.775
I DON'T WANT TO GO, DAD.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.512
MAX, THIS MIGHT BE
GOOD FOR YOU.

07:24.512 --> 07:27.047
WILL YOU GO WITH ME?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.248
WE CAN ALL GO.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.951
NO, JUST DAD.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.319
ARE YOU SURE?

07:32.319 --> 07:37.725
BECAUSE YOUR MOM REALLY WANTS TO
TAKE ONE OF US TO THERAPY.

07:37.725 --> 07:43.063
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE
HER OLYMPICS.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.167
I'D RATHER JUST GO
WITH YOU.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.905
THAT'S FINE, THAT'S OKAY.
AS LONG AS YOU GET HELP,

07:51.905 --> 07:54.407
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO YOU GO WITH,

07:54.407 --> 07:58.846
BUT CAN YOU TELL ME WHY?
WHY DAD? I NEED TO KNOW WHY.

07:58.846 --> 08:02.616
THAT'S KIND OF WHY, MOM.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.655
I'LL TAKE YOU, MAX, OKAY?
GET YOUR STUFF.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.359
WHAT CAN I SAY?

08:12.359 --> 08:15.195
HE WANTS TO GO WITH ME.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.030
I UNDERSTAND.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.566
YOU DO LOTS OF STUFF
WITH HIM.

08:18.566 --> 08:22.035
I KNOW, I KNOW.

08:22.035 --> 08:22.870
YOU OKAY?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.872
YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE WAITED

08:24.872 --> 08:28.008
TO TAKE SOMEONE
IN THIS FAMILY TO THERAPY?

08:31.712 --> 08:35.115
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU COULD GO
TO THERAPY BY YOURSELF.

08:38.185 --> 08:43.924
MAYBE TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT
YOUR "KNOW-IT-ALL" SYNDROME.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.727
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS "KNOW-IT-ALL" SYNDROME.

08:46.727 --> 08:50.731
WELL, I GUESS YOU WOULD KNOW.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.006
THANK GOD THIS SCHOOL
BROUGHT IN ALL THESE COUNSELORS.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.308
MY KID'S FREAKED OUT,
PROBABLY WORSE THAN ANYONE.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.744
HE CAN'T EVEN WATCH
THE NEWS ANYMORE.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.145
WELL, MY LINDA WON'T EAT,

09:05.145 --> 09:07.314
AND SHE MADE ME WALK HER
TO SCHOOL TODAY.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.216
THAT'S NOTHIN'.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.984
MY SON'S HAVING NIGHTMARES.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.520
HE WET THE BED
AND HE'S SO DYSLEXIC,

09:13.520 --> 09:16.957
THAT WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED,
HE DIDN'T RUN TOWARD THE EXIT,

09:16.957 --> 09:18.959
'CAUSE HE THOUGHT IT SAID
"TAXI."

09:18.959 --> 09:23.063
MR. LOPEZ, CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.867
I GUESS THIS IS WORSE
THAN I THOUGHT.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.042
SO I'VE BEEN TALKING
WITH MAX,

09:35.042 --> 09:37.878
AND HE SEEMS TO BE COPING WELL
WITH THE SHOOTING.

09:37.878 --> 09:38.846
MAN, ONE SESSION
AND HE'S FIXED?

09:38.846 --> 09:40.347
IF I THROW IN 50 BUCKS,

09:40.347 --> 09:43.917
CAN YOU FIND OUT WHY HE WON'T
LET HIS GREEN BEANS

09:43.917 --> 09:45.352
TOUCH HIS MASHED POTATOES?

09:45.352 --> 09:48.121
'CAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON THERE.

09:48.121 --> 09:51.825
YOU KNOW, MAX WET HIS BED
BECAUSE HE HAD A NIGHTMARE

09:51.825 --> 09:54.394
THAT HE WAS CHASED
BY A KILLER THROUGH THE HOUSE,

09:54.394 --> 09:56.830
AND HE COULDN'T FIND YOU.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.300
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
FLY AWAY?

10:02.269 --> 10:03.671
IT'S A DREAM, MAX.

10:03.671 --> 10:06.907
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
WORK WITHIN YOUR OWN MIND.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.144
LAST NIGHT, I HAD A DREAM
I WAS IN THE DESERT.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.147
I TURNED A CACTUS
INTO SELMA HAYEK

10:15.783 --> 10:17.951
HURT LIKE HELL,
BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.754
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.090
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
THAT MAX'S PROBLEM

10:23.090 --> 10:25.726
IS NOT
WITH THE SCHOOL SHOOTING.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.560
HIS PROBLEM IS WITH YOU.

10:27.560 --> 10:31.064
ME?! WHAT DID I DO?!

10:31.064 --> 10:33.967
HE'S DEFENSIVE.
DID I CALL IT OR WHAT, HUH?

10:35.102 --> 10:37.204
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:37.204 --> 10:39.206
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL YOUR DAD?

10:39.206 --> 10:43.476
I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU STAY AT ERNIE'S.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.845
I WANT YOU TO COME HOME.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.347
MAX, I AM HOME.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.182
ARE YOU GONNA LEAVE AGAIN?

10:49.182 --> 10:53.286
NO. OKAY, LOOK, I'M NEVER,
EVER GONNA LEAVE AGAIN.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.722
BUT GRANDMA'S
STILL LIVING THERE,

10:54.722 --> 11:00.593
AND YOU GUYS
ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING.

11:00.593 --> 11:03.430
I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.431
THANKS.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.099
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT, RAT.

11:07.667 --> 11:14.742
SO WHAT MAX SEEMS TO SAY IS
THAT YOU'VE HAD SOME ISSUES

11:14.742 --> 11:16.376
WITH, UH, YOUR MOTHER?

11:16.376 --> 11:19.212
THAT'S WHERE YOU GUYS
ALWAYS GO, ISN'T IT?

11:19.212 --> 11:20.748
WELL, IT'S A NATURAL
STARTING POINT.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.149
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

11:22.149 --> 11:25.285
MY OWN MOTHER WAS
CONTROLLING AND HEARTLESS,

11:25.285 --> 11:28.121
BUT WE FINALLY HAD
A BREAKTHROUGH--

11:28.121 --> 11:31.925
SHE DIED.

11:31.925 --> 11:35.328
LOOK, DOCTOR, EVEN IF
I DID WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT,

11:35.328 --> 11:37.430
AND MY MOM WAS
DRIVING ME CRAZY, I'M CHICANO.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.400
WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THERAPY.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.236
YOU WERE TREATED POORLY
AS A CHILD, WEREN'T YOU?

11:43.236 --> 11:46.974
YEAH, SO WHAT? LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DOCTOR,

11:46.974 --> 11:48.641
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK,
OKAY?

11:48.641 --> 11:50.610
YOU CAN DIG AND DIG AND DIG,

11:50.610 --> 11:52.612
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ANYTHING,

11:52.612 --> 11:54.748
SO MY FATHER ABANDONED ME?
SO WHAT?

11:57.050 --> 12:02.322
MAYBE HE WOULD HAVE STAYED
IF I HAD BEEN A GOOD BOY.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.892
MY MOM SAYS
I WAS ALWAYS CRYING AND...

12:04.892 --> 12:07.260
BUT WHAT DOES SHE KNOW?

12:07.260 --> 12:10.163
MY GOD, IT'S MY FAULT.
I'M UNLOVABLE.

12:11.498 --> 12:15.035
ARE YOU GETTING THIS DOWN?
I DON'T SEE WRITING.

12:25.979 --> 12:30.617
SHE SAID THAT MY CHICKEN POX
WAS GOD PUNISHING ME

12:30.617 --> 12:33.353
FOR NOT MAKING IT
TO THE POTTY.

12:35.388 --> 12:39.292
MR. LOPEZ...

12:39.292 --> 12:43.263
SCHOOL'S OVER.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.798
I HAVE TO GO.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.433
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.402
WANT TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY FIRST DOG LARRY?

12:49.402 --> 12:51.905
OH, GOD, NO, NO, NO.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.941
I'M BORDERLINE DEPRESSIVE
AS IT IS.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.909
I JUST WANT TO TAKE
MY MEDICATION,

12:55.909 --> 12:59.179
PUT ON AN EYE MASK
AND LIE DOWN.

12:59.179 --> 13:03.650
I CAN WAIT.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.486
NO, NO, NO.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.489
MR. LOPEZ, I WAS HIRED TO DEAL
WITH THE SCHOOL SHOOTING, OKAY,

13:09.489 --> 13:12.860
NOT THE DEMON PARADE YOU HAVE
RUNNING AROUND IN THERE,

13:12.860 --> 13:14.294
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
LOOK, IF YOU WANT

13:14.294 --> 13:16.796
TO SEE ME AGAIN,
YOU CAN MEET ME IN MY OFFICE.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.365
WOULD I HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT?

13:18.365 --> 13:21.401
YES, IT'S A PRIVATE PRACTICE.
$150 A HOUR.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.904
OKAY, WELL, I DON'T NEED
ANY MORE THERAPY,

13:23.904 --> 13:25.405
BUT WHY DON'T WE
JUST STAY FRIENDS

13:25.405 --> 13:28.942
AND WE CAN HAVE LUNCH
IN YOUR OFFICE ONCE A WEEK?

13:28.942 --> 13:30.643
I'LL BRING CHICKEN.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.445
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.681
WE COULD E-MAIL
EACH OTHER.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.649
NO.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.952
I.M. BUDDIES?

13:42.022 --> 13:44.091
(door opens)

13:44.091 --> 13:46.226
SO WHAT HAPPENED
IN COUNSELING?

13:46.226 --> 13:48.795
TURNS OUT THE SHOOTING
ISN'T WHAT BOTHERED MAX.

13:48.795 --> 13:51.899
HIS NIGHTMARE HAS TO DO
WITH ME BEING OUT OF THE HOUSE,

13:51.899 --> 13:53.533
BUT THAT'S OVER NOW.

13:53.533 --> 13:57.804
DAD SPENT, LIKE, THREE HOURS
WITH THE THERAPIST BY HIMSELF.

13:57.804 --> 14:00.440
YOU'RE KIDDING.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.675
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN THERAPY.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.843
I KNOW.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.280
BUT SOMEHOW PHILLIP
GOT ME TO OPEN UP.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.784
THAT'S MY THERAPIST, ANGIE--
PHILLIP. HE LISTENS.

14:11.784 --> 14:16.589
SO YOU OPENED UP?

14:16.589 --> 14:19.526
YOU ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT
REAL EMOTIONAL ISSUES?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.228
ANGIE, I SPILLED MY GUTS.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.264
I SAID THINGS I THOUGHT
I WOULD NEVER SAY SOBER.

14:25.632 --> 14:29.202
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU
TO DO THAT FOR YEARS.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.472
I KNOW, BUT IT'S...
DIFFERENT WITH PHILLIP.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.308
YOU KNOW, I FEEL...

14:35.308 --> 14:36.776
SAFE.

14:36.776 --> 14:41.614
OKAY, WELL,
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

14:41.614 --> 14:43.050
SORRY. IT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.085
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

14:45.085 --> 14:47.087
SEE, RIGHT THERE,
WHEN YOU YELL AT ME,

14:47.087 --> 14:49.957
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
IT CAUSES ME TO SHUT DOWN.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.194
WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT
YOUR CONTROL ISSUES.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.762
I DON'T KNOW, GEORGE.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.298
I DON'T THINK THIS THERAPIST
KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.668
HE SAID YOU'D SAY THAT.

15:01.668 --> 15:05.939
OKAY, IF YOU'RE GONNA
MOVE BACK INTO THE HOUSE,

15:05.939 --> 15:08.441
THEN WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT YOUR MOM?

15:08.441 --> 15:10.743
I'M GONNA TALK TO HER.
WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH THIS,

15:10.743 --> 15:13.646
BECAUSE THIS IS THE STUFF
THAT'S AFFECTING MY KIDS

15:13.646 --> 15:14.948
AND MY MARRIAGE.

15:14.948 --> 15:18.018
PHILLIP IS RIGHT!
YOU GO, PHILLIP!

15:18.018 --> 15:22.122
I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT
FOR 19 YEARS.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.491
WELL, DID YOU SAY IT
OR DID YOU YELL IT?

15:24.491 --> 15:28.328
BECAUSE PHILLIP SAYS
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.070
MOM, FEEL LIKE A DRINK?

15:37.070 --> 15:40.107
I FOUND A GOOD BOTTLE
OF TEQUILA.

15:40.107 --> 15:43.710
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DO FEEL LIKE HAVING A DRINK.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.114
THIS'LL BE A GOOD TIME.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.384
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.754
WHERE YOU GOING? I THOUGHT
WE COULD DRINK IT TOGETHER.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.556
GOOD-BYE, GOOD TIME.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.326
HAVE A SEAT.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.328
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.097
WHAT'S WITH THE TISSUES?

16:04.097 --> 16:06.399
LOOK, I'M NOT LEAVING
THE HOUSE AGAIN,

16:06.399 --> 16:08.401
AND YOU'RE AFRAID
TO LIVE ALONE,

16:08.401 --> 16:09.736
SO IF WE'RE GONNA BE
STUCK TOGETHER,

16:09.736 --> 16:11.838
WE GOT SOME THINGS
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH,

16:11.838 --> 16:13.140
AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT

16:13.140 --> 16:15.108
IS TO FINALLY BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.110
GEORGE, PEOPLE SAY
THEY WANT HONESTY,

16:17.110 --> 16:19.112
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.880
WELL, I DO.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.815
OKAY, WELL, LET'S START.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.851
I LIED TO YOU ABOUT YOUR AGE

16:24.851 --> 16:27.987
SO YOU COULD START KINDERGARTEN
A YEAR LATER.

16:27.987 --> 16:32.025
WHAT? I'M A YEAR OLDER
THAN I THOUGHT I WAS?

16:32.025 --> 16:35.095
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

16:37.597 --> 16:41.000
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOUR REAL NAME IS?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.503
"GEORGE" IS MY REAL NAME.

16:43.503 --> 16:47.040
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED
TO BELIEVE, FERNANDO.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.942
MOM... YOU GOTTA DO THIS.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.578
NO. I DON'T.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.513
DON'T DO IT FOR ME.
DO IT FOR MAX.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.716
HE'S HAVING TROUBLE 'CAUSE
I'M NOT LIVING HERE, OKAY?

16:56.716 --> 16:58.718
DO IT FOR HIM.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.189
COME ON, POPEYE.
I GOT YOUR SPINACH RIGHT HERE.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.260
CAN I AT LEAST TURN IT
INTO A DRINKING GAME?

17:07.260 --> 17:11.064
EVERY TIME YOU ANNOY ME,
I GET TO TAKE A SHOT.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.166
THIS ISN'T A GAME, MOM.
I'M SERIOUS.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.868
HERE WE GO.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.038
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING. JUST LISTEN.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.674
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.177
SOMETIMES I BLAME YOU
FOR MY FAILURES,

17:24.177 --> 17:25.912
AND I'M SORRY, OKAY?

17:25.912 --> 17:28.181
I KNOW I NEED TO CHANGE
MY WAYS.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.782
LIKE, WHEN YOU SAY
MEAN THINGS TO ME,

17:29.782 --> 17:31.284
INSTEAD OF SLAMMING YOU BACK,

17:31.284 --> 17:34.354
I PROBABLY SHOULD JUST TELL YOU
HOW MUCH IT HURTS ME.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.524
I JUST WISH WE COULD GET TO
A PLACE WHERE I COULD TELL YOU

17:37.524 --> 17:41.861
THAT YOU'RE MY MOM
AND I LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.731
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.367
WOW.

17:47.367 --> 17:52.139
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE
GONNA BE SO VULNERABLE.

17:52.139 --> 17:55.074
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

17:55.074 --> 17:57.344
LIKE...

17:57.344 --> 18:00.447
I WOULD RATHER LIVE ALONE

18:00.447 --> 18:03.350
THAN TURN INTO A GIANT WEENIE
LIKE YOU.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.124
HOW DID IT GO?

18:11.124 --> 18:13.059
SOME GOOD, SOME BAD.
SHE'S MOVING OUT,

18:13.059 --> 18:16.829
OH, YEAH, AND YOU'RE MARRIED
TO AN OLDER GUY NAMED FERNANDO.

18:26.373 --> 18:29.642
BENNY, DO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE
RIGHT THIS MINUTE?

18:29.642 --> 18:31.344
WHY DON'T YOU STAY
FOR DINNER?

18:31.344 --> 18:34.314
NO, I ALREADY CALLED GINA.
SHE'S PICKING ME UP.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.083
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING
BECAUSE OF ME, ARE YOU?

18:37.083 --> 18:42.422
WHAT? NO.
HEY, DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.557
I CAN'T STAND
ANY OF YOU ANYMORE.

18:44.557 --> 18:48.161
YOU'RE ALL
GETTING ON MY NERVES.

18:48.161 --> 18:51.764
YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN'T TAKE
ANOTHER NIGHT OF YOUR COOKING.

18:51.764 --> 18:55.335
IF THERE'S ANY JUSTICE
IN THE WORLD,

18:55.335 --> 18:58.371
A CHICKEN WILL COME BACK
FROM THE DEAD

18:58.371 --> 19:00.673
AND MAKE YOU FLAVORLESS.

19:00.673 --> 19:04.511
AND YOU, I CAN'T EVEN
GET INTO THE BATHROOM

19:04.511 --> 19:07.680
WHEN YOU'RE HOME, CLOWN FACE.

19:09.582 --> 19:14.221
I'VE SEEN DRAG QUEENS
PUT ON THEIR MAKEUP FASTER.

19:14.221 --> 19:18.458
A-AND YOU, MIJO, YOU'RE 14.

19:18.458 --> 19:23.062
YOUR PITS ARE UP AND RUNNING!

19:23.062 --> 19:25.765
SAY THE BIG WORD
WITH GRANDMA--

19:25.765 --> 19:27.634
"DEODORANT."

19:29.736 --> 19:31.037
HEY!

19:31.037 --> 19:35.508
OH, AND YOU, GOD GAVE YOU
THOSE BIG EARS FOR A REASON.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.478
HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO REPRODUCE.

19:38.478 --> 19:42.649
GOLLY, WHAT DID I DO?

19:42.649 --> 19:47.620
THANKS, MOM. THAT WAS NICE
WHAT YOU DID IN THERE.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.657
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
MY GOOD-BYE TO YOU.

19:50.657 --> 19:55.762
OKAY, I'M READY.
HIT ME WITH YOUR BEST SHOT.

19:55.762 --> 20:00.300
THANKS FOR LETTING ME STAY HERE
TILL I GOT BACK ON MY FEET.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.008
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

20:09.008 --> 20:11.143
NO. WHAT DID SHE SAY?

20:11.143 --> 20:13.680
ANGIE, SHE SAID "THANK YOU."

20:13.680 --> 20:16.849
SHE ACTUALLY SHOWED ME
GRATITUDE.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.118
HONEY, THIS IS SO GREAT!

20:19.118 --> 20:22.889
I KNOW. I CAN'T WAIT TO GO
CALL PHILLIP AND TELL HIM!

20:28.928 --> 20:32.365
SO I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM
IS THAT MY HUSBAND

20:32.365 --> 20:34.367
HAS INTIMACY ISSUES
BECAUSE HIS MOTHER

20:34.367 --> 20:36.903
COULDN'T FACE
HER OWN EMOTIONS.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.471
WHAT DOES THAT SOUND LIKE
TO YOU, DOCTOR?

20:38.471 --> 20:40.106
I THINK GEORGE IS FINE,

20:40.106 --> 20:45.111
BUT I THINK THAT YOU'RE
SUFFERING FROM WHAT WE CALL

20:45.111 --> 20:46.846
"KNOW-IT-ALL-SYNDROME."

20:46.846 --> 20:48.415
WHAT?!

20:52.385 --> 20:56.188
THAT'S NOT A REAL DISEASE.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.024
HEY, ONE OF THE SIGNS IS

20:58.024 --> 21:00.627
ASSUMING THAT YOU KNOW MORE
THAN DOCTORS.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.934
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON THE KIDS.

21:11.504 --> 21:14.541
(laughs) THANKS, MAN.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.376
I-I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.

21:16.376 --> 21:20.747
IT WAS WRONG,
AND IT WAS UNETHICAL...

21:20.747 --> 21:28.455
BUT SHE JUST KEPT TALKING
AND TALKING AND TALKING.
