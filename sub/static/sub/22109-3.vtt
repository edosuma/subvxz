00:16.617 --> 00:18.619

(plays jazz melody)

D'oh!

00:48.882 --> 00:50.451

01:01.729 --> 01:03.497
(Marge grumbling)

01:05.299 --> 01:06.967
-Homer.
-Hey.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.569
-Homer.
-Huh? What?

01:08.602 --> 01:09.770
I'll be right home.

01:09.803 --> 01:10.938
You are home.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.606
(whoops, snores)

01:12.640 --> 01:13.807
Homer.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.276
Homer, wake up, please.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.610
I can't sleep.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.746
I'm having friends
over tomorrow.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.215
-Luann Van Houten.
-Back-stabber.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.251
-Bernice Hibbert.
-Snob.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.918
And Helen Lovejoy.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.120
Okay, she's pretty hot.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.588
I mean, hot for
a reverend's wife,

01:27.621 --> 01:29.056
but so judgmental.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.591
(sighs)

01:30.624 --> 01:33.093
I was going to ask you
if you could watch Maggie.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.228
Oh, yeah, of course.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.130
What do you suspect?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.432
-(gulps)
-(sucks)

01:38.466 --> 01:39.967
Isn't this great?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.769
Daddy-baby alone time.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.104
Where's Daddy?
Peek-a-boo.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.274
(squeals and laughs)

01:46.307 --> 01:48.742
-Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.
-(sighs)

01:48.776 --> 01:50.911
-Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.
-Meh.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.113
-Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.
-(blows raspberry)

01:53.147 --> 01:55.283
Where's Daddy?
Peek-a-boo.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.950
Oh, you're sick of it already?

01:56.984 --> 01:59.086
I was gonna do different people.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.622
Peek-a-boo-ooh!

02:01.655 --> 02:03.457
(with British accent):
I'm afraid, Master Wayne,

02:03.491 --> 02:05.593
it's time for peek-a-boo.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.094
Ah, come on. Nothing?

02:07.127 --> 02:09.797
Babies love Michael Caine.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.132
What to do? What to do?

02:12.166 --> 02:14.768
What to... do.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.339
What... to... do.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.941
Mags, I'll level with you.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.310
I love you, kiddo,

02:22.343 --> 02:25.112
but we are in two
completely different worlds.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.147
-(gulps)
-(sucks)

02:31.084 --> 02:32.486
More lemonade, ladies?

02:32.520 --> 02:34.054
No, thank you.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.990
I've had better lemonade
at Ralph Wiggum's stand.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.992
And he stirs it
with his finger.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.629
(laughing)

02:41.662 --> 02:45.299
So we've been asked to
redecorate the school room

02:45.333 --> 02:47.535
where the kids wait
when their ride is late.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.136
I have some ideas.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.672
Marge, you have many
wonderful talents,

02:51.705 --> 02:53.674
but your sense
of style is, uh...

02:53.707 --> 02:56.076
-One of them?
-I'm afraid not.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.011
Purple and orange cupboards,

02:58.045 --> 02:59.480
oh, corncob curtains,

02:59.513 --> 03:01.515
rabbit ears on the TV.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.884
It's like we're visiting
the Flintstones.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.853
(laughing)

03:05.886 --> 03:07.688
Well, since you don't like
my style,

03:07.721 --> 03:09.657
maybe I should
show you the door.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.726
You mean the brown door
next to the hot pink walls.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.662
Just like at the circus.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.030
Well, an elephant
does live here.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.532
An elephant?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.868
You're calling my husband
an elephant?

03:20.901 --> 03:23.170
HOMER:
Marge, we got any more peanuts?

03:23.203 --> 03:25.205
(groaning):
Oh, Homer.

03:26.740 --> 03:27.908
Hmm.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.943
No.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.546
(whistling)

03:32.580 --> 03:33.714
What the... ?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.383
(whistling)

03:35.416 --> 03:37.050
Is it that bird?

03:37.084 --> 03:40.220
(whistling)

03:40.254 --> 03:42.756
-Marge! Are you making tea?
-MARGE: Yes.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.725
-Whew.
-MARGE: Iced tea.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.360
(whimpering):
What the hell?

03:46.394 --> 03:47.695
(whistling continues)

03:47.728 --> 03:49.363
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
This is WHIS.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.365
Whistling at you
all day and night.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.901
WHIS, The Whistle.

03:53.934 --> 03:57.538
Ah. Whistling format radio.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.040
-(whistling continues)
-Huh?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.776
Where is that whistling
coming from?

04:04.111 --> 04:06.547
-(whistles)
-Maggie?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.081
(whistles)

04:09.783 --> 04:11.084
(whistles)

04:11.118 --> 04:12.586
It is you!

04:12.620 --> 04:15.623
It's so odd--
I'm a terrible whistler.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.891
-Always have been.
-(sad whistle)

04:17.925 --> 04:20.394
There must be a reason
you were given this gift.

04:20.428 --> 04:24.665
(gasps) It's to make people
think I can whistle!

04:24.698 --> 04:26.767
(whistling "1812 Overture")

04:28.035 --> 04:30.571
AUDIENCE (chanting):
Homer! Homer! Homer!

04:30.604 --> 04:32.473
And now I will perform

04:32.506 --> 04:36.109
"Flight of the Bumblebee."

04:36.143 --> 04:38.145
(whistling "Flight
of the Bumblebee")

04:49.823 --> 04:51.792
Who was that president?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.327
He looked pretty generic.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.764
(grumbles)

04:56.797 --> 04:59.467
I do too have taste.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.835
-I'm afraid not.
-(growls)

05:01.869 --> 05:04.004
Corncob curtains.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.639
Mom, what's wrong?

05:05.673 --> 05:07.475
Why aren't you answering me?

05:07.508 --> 05:08.842
I'm right here.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.144
Honey, I'm just
feeling sorry for myself,

05:11.178 --> 05:12.946
but I'll show them.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.450
I'll make a late pickup room
like that school has never seen.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.519
That'll be easy,
there's never been one.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.856
*

05:46.113 --> 05:48.115
(brakes squeal)

05:51.952 --> 05:54.388
*

05:54.422 --> 05:57.691
Well, what do you think
of my late pickup room?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.493
It's wonderful.
Hard to believe

05:59.527 --> 06:02.062
it's the same room they found
all those dead rats in.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.997
(laughs)

06:04.031 --> 06:06.233
Well, maybe you can
fool the Hibberts,

06:06.266 --> 06:07.868
but to me, this is
the work of a...

06:07.901 --> 06:08.936
Genius.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.672
Salud.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.007
(giggles)
Well, gee.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.043
Guess who got a job today.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.210
-You?
-Nope.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.079
The guy who went in after me.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.348
I-I totally set him up.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.885
Listen, I recently purchased
the old post office to renovate.

06:24.918 --> 06:29.056
Would you like to be
my interior decorator?

06:29.089 --> 06:31.058
Well, ladies.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.360
Looks like someone
appreciates me--

06:33.393 --> 06:36.229
the one man in town
who trims his nails.

06:36.263 --> 06:38.766
Is one of them
giving you trouble?

06:38.799 --> 06:40.701
There's no room
in the trunk, boss.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.202
-Bodies?
-No.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.937
Bottled water
and toilet paper, remember?

06:43.971 --> 06:46.239
We made that Costco run.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.576
(beautifully whistling
"Old MacDonald Had a Farm")

06:48.609 --> 06:50.077
Now do it backwards.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.912
(whistling same tune backwards)

06:51.945 --> 06:53.213
Now sideways.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.748
Hey, come on.
She's just a baby.

06:54.782 --> 06:55.916
Who is?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.050
Uh, my talent.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.285
Makes sense.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.253
Well, well, well.

07:00.287 --> 07:03.624
Seems like my no-talent son
can suddenly whistle.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.927
Tell me, Homer,
how'd you trill that high "C"

07:06.960 --> 07:09.262
with your lips
in second position?

07:09.296 --> 07:11.298
(whistling)

07:13.667 --> 07:17.437
Oh, it's amazing.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.944
She's got my whistling gene,
all right.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.446
Which, unfortunately,
skips a generation.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.416
I hope it works out better
for you than it did for me.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.319
I was booked on the top
whistling show on radio,

07:32.352 --> 07:35.956
Your Blow of Blows,
with Sid Wheezer.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.558
(applause)

07:38.692 --> 07:40.794
Good evening, folks.
Sid Wheezer here,

07:40.828 --> 07:43.363
sipping a delicious Buzz Cola.

07:43.396 --> 07:46.534
(fizzing, liquid pouring,
cymbal crashes)

07:46.567 --> 07:47.968
Ah, refreshing.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.671
Keep polio at bay,
the Buzz Cola way.

07:50.704 --> 07:51.772
(laughter)

07:51.805 --> 07:52.973
Oh, thanks a lot.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.141
Our next act is a swell kid

07:54.174 --> 07:55.676
from right here in Springfield.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.145
His hobby is straightening
elbow macaroni.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.848
(chuckles) Let's hear it for
Little Abraham Simpson.

08:00.881 --> 08:01.849
(applause)

08:01.882 --> 08:04.685
(whistles a tune)

08:04.718 --> 08:06.353
GRAMPA:
Then I got cocky.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.322
Tried a little stunt called
the Triple Windy.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.358
(whistling "Heart and Soul"
in harmony)

08:17.497 --> 08:20.467
-(ripping)
-(gasping)

08:20.500 --> 08:22.836
GRAMPA: Blew out the ligaments
in my lips.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.838
Had to hire guys to kiss
my girlfriend.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.339
It was a good deal.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.708
I'd pay for five minutes,

08:27.741 --> 08:29.643
but it would go on for hours.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.011
*

08:31.044 --> 08:32.345
When the time was right,

08:32.379 --> 08:33.981
I'd make my move.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.016
*

08:38.619 --> 08:41.354
But this little magpie,
she's got my gift.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.523
And now she's going
into showbiz.

08:43.557 --> 08:44.725
Mwah.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.193
Couldn't showbiz screw her up?

08:46.226 --> 08:47.695
You know,
like it did Ron Howard?

08:47.728 --> 08:50.664
He hasn't won an Oscar
since 2002.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.500
Oh, please, son,
do this for me.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.369
Dad, you should not live your
life through your granddaughter.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.405
(whistling "Heart and Soul"
in harmony)

09:06.947 --> 09:09.216
You poor guy.
She'll do it.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.955
(birds chirping, squawking)

09:18.258 --> 09:20.928
Okay, Maggie.
Time to learn a happy tune

09:20.961 --> 09:23.230
from these imprisoned birds.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.698
(whistles)

09:24.732 --> 09:26.767
(whistles same tune)

09:26.800 --> 09:29.036
Man, Maggie's talented,
Lisa's talented.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.270
What am I good at?

09:30.303 --> 09:31.705
The birds love ya.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.573
Well, yeah, but they
also love Grampa.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.746
Go ahead, but my blood's
turned to bile

09:38.779 --> 09:41.615
from watching Fox News.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.550
(shrieks, thud)

09:43.583 --> 09:45.318
(laughs)

09:45.352 --> 09:47.454
This is my new property,

09:47.487 --> 09:50.290
the original
Springfield Post Office,

09:50.323 --> 09:53.326
jewel of the implosion district.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.262
(rumbling)

09:56.129 --> 09:58.065
You'll get used to that.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.935
We'll definitely want to try
to keep the original facade.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.103
Yes, indeed.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.773
I'm all about keeping up
facades.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.975
Is it okay if I take some
foundation measurements?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.476
Of course.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.611
In case she sees something
she shouldn't,

10:11.645 --> 10:13.346
have a hood ready.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.582
(gun hammers click)

10:15.615 --> 10:17.350
-(gunshot)
-(gasps)

10:17.384 --> 10:19.787
Idiota! You whack
who you shouldn't,

10:19.820 --> 10:21.789
and you don't whack
who you should.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.624
(sighs) Is this about
your brother again?

10:24.658 --> 10:26.960
(upbeat showbiz music playing)

10:33.166 --> 10:35.002
You're gonna love this baby!

10:35.035 --> 10:37.304
-She whistles!
-This I gotta hear--

10:37.337 --> 10:39.439
not because I am
looking forward to it,

10:39.472 --> 10:41.508
but because it is my job.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.548
-(whistles circus music)
-Fantastic talent!

10:48.581 --> 10:51.151
Now, move along--
I have a heart attack at 4:00.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.686
And... here it comes.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.688
Ooh! Oy vey!

10:56.589 --> 10:58.658
("The Simpsons Theme" plays)

10:59.659 --> 11:01.628
You sit on it,
you bought it.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.863
Due!

11:04.531 --> 11:06.834
Can you picture
this water feature

11:06.867 --> 11:09.336
at the back wall
of the foyer?

11:09.369 --> 11:12.005
My sainted mother
shared your gift.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.474
Where others saw only
an empty Chianti bottle,

11:14.507 --> 11:16.877
she saw a candleholder.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.512
We would have to rip out
some walls.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.315
-Done. -You won't be seeing
those walls no more.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.152
Why do these guys come with us
for everything?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.187
Have you noticed
how we are not dead?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.556
That is mostly due to them.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.825
Give the wall job
to the Palermo brothers.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.494
Tell them to make it
look like an accident.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.364
We'll make that wall
dig its own grave.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.666
(someone whistling arpeggios)

11:39.699 --> 11:43.203
(whistled arpeggios continue)

11:43.236 --> 11:45.338
What's that whistling?

11:45.372 --> 11:47.207
You know what they say--
in a marriage,

11:47.240 --> 11:49.910
don't ask a question
you don't know the answer to.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.013
-That's what they say
to defense attorneys. -Marge,

11:53.046 --> 11:56.016
how would you feel
if I kept a big secret from you?

11:56.049 --> 11:59.119
How would you feel
if I kept a big secret from you?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.222
-Good night.
-Good night.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.230

12:10.263 --> 12:11.932
Maggie, you can whistle?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.600
(whistles arpeggio)

12:13.633 --> 12:16.036
(gasps)
You're gifted, too!

12:16.069 --> 12:18.105
Maybe more gifted!

12:18.138 --> 12:20.740
No, no, I will not
get caught in that trap

12:20.774 --> 12:22.776
that only one of us is good.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.412
We could both be good,
like the South Park guys.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.580
Except Trey does everything.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.282
Trey does everything!

12:29.316 --> 12:31.618
(panting)

12:32.652 --> 12:34.721
(Maggie whistles arpeggio)

12:34.754 --> 12:36.123
Diva.

12:36.857 --> 12:37.825
This little piggy

12:37.858 --> 12:38.959
went to Broadway.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.228
This little piggy
worked with Stallone.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.331
This little piggy
got a Showtime special!

12:44.364 --> 12:46.599
-(laughing)
-(squealing happily)

12:46.633 --> 12:48.601
I'm a great father.

ANNOUNCER: Tonight
on Hollywood Nightmares,

12:51.304 --> 12:53.440
-What?!
-...child stars, prison bars.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.342
-(prison bars clack)
-Ooh!

12:55.375 --> 12:58.778
At three months old, Skyler
Green could already patty-cake.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.447
By age one,
she was the opening act

13:00.480 --> 13:02.816
for Frank Sinatra Jr. Jr. III.

13:05.152 --> 13:08.121
But after a disastrous
Super Bowl halftime show

13:08.155 --> 13:11.258
that left Jacksonville's
EverBank Field in ruins,

13:11.291 --> 13:14.161
Skyler's life
would spin out of control.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.929
She began a downward spiral,

13:15.963 --> 13:17.998
woke up too many mornings
with stuffed animals

13:18.031 --> 13:19.867
whose names she didn't know,

13:19.900 --> 13:21.969
and she was arrested twice
for former cuteness,

13:22.002 --> 13:23.670
under the Scott Baio Law.

13:23.703 --> 13:26.006
Patty-cake, patty-cake,
baker's man,

13:26.039 --> 13:29.943
bake me a train wreck
just as fast as you can.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.012
Oh, my God.
Am I doing this for you,

13:32.045 --> 13:34.181
or because it
makes me feel good?

13:36.716 --> 13:38.485
A showbiz kiss!

13:38.518 --> 13:41.554
There's nothing more sincere
than that. We'll do it!

13:43.023 --> 13:44.691
(ominous music plays)

13:51.231 --> 13:53.366
Marge, I love what
you've done here.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.202
It's as much "Mwah!"

13:55.235 --> 13:57.637
as it is "Ey! Whoa!"

13:57.670 --> 14:00.640
It certainly was a challenge--
so many bedrooms.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.410
You must be expecting
a lot of sleepover guests.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.979
Is she, er, uh,
one of the, uh...?

14:06.013 --> 14:08.148
No, no.
She's the decorator.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.217
But I can get one like her.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.385
Add it to my
customer profile.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.254
Er, uh, yes.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.323
Dim lighting,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.025
honky-tonk piano...

14:18.058 --> 14:19.726
Anthony D'Amico,

14:19.759 --> 14:22.229
what is the repute
of this house?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.663
Ill.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.366
Our top story--
you didn't see me.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.834
This is...

14:27.867 --> 14:30.070
John Doe saying "Good night."

14:36.576 --> 14:39.212
Why is everyone being so weird?
Did the principal call?

14:39.246 --> 14:41.014
'Cause he's got nothing
to call about.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.215
(phone buzzes)

14:42.249 --> 14:44.051
(animal growling)

14:44.084 --> 14:47.054
I can't keep this mountain lion
in my bedroom forever, Bart.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.755
Just four more days.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.457
(mountain lion yowls)

14:50.490 --> 14:53.626
So listen, uh, I'm gonna take
Maggie out for a walk.

14:56.930 --> 15:00.067
These spray-on boas
are such a time-saver.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.437
(spray can hisses)

15:04.471 --> 15:06.139
HOMER:
Oh, God, that's good.

15:06.173 --> 15:10.643
Seems like everybody's got
a secret but us, huh, guys?

15:14.114 --> 15:15.582
*

15:15.615 --> 15:17.884
ANNOUNCER:
Tonight, see Maggie Simpson,

15:17.917 --> 15:19.052
the Unborn Comic,

15:19.086 --> 15:20.920
The Umbilical Chords

15:20.954 --> 15:22.255
and the Pixie Chicks.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.590
And now your host,

15:23.623 --> 15:26.059
Sedgwick the Personality!

15:26.093 --> 15:28.428
Welcome to whatever this is.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.430
Now, let's meet our judges.

15:30.463 --> 15:34.067
NBA star
and host of Flip That Igloo,

15:34.101 --> 15:36.603
Muk Mu!

15:36.636 --> 15:37.770
Peace.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.739
Former Hot Tots champion,

15:39.772 --> 15:42.275
Baby Dimples Riskind!

15:42.309 --> 15:46.279
And robotic-themed DJ
Der Zip-Zorp!

15:46.313 --> 15:47.647
(beeping)

15:50.817 --> 15:54.354
You had lunch, didn't you?

15:54.387 --> 15:56.789
I gave you a 2:00 a.m.
curfew for a reason!

15:56.823 --> 15:58.025
Shut up!

15:58.058 --> 16:00.527
(groans)
Where's denial when you need it?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.295
Maggie, this is
no place for you.

16:02.329 --> 16:05.832
I'm taking you where you
can be a kid again-- Moe's.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.840
Oh, I've created a monster!

16:13.873 --> 16:15.875
I've placated a monster!

16:17.477 --> 16:18.478
Oh...

16:18.511 --> 16:21.614
Marge Simpson,
are the rumors true?

16:21.648 --> 16:24.017
Did you corncob a cathouse?

16:24.051 --> 16:25.985
It's not that.

16:26.019 --> 16:30.223
I sure love that
new whorehouse smell.

16:30.257 --> 16:33.160
Marge, I never thought someone
could sink this town lower,

16:33.193 --> 16:34.894
but you have.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.896
You lied to me!

16:36.929 --> 16:38.665
You may scare these guys,

16:38.698 --> 16:41.368
but to me, you're
just a big fat liar!

16:41.401 --> 16:43.803
Whoa. Nobody calls
Fat Tony fat!

16:43.836 --> 16:45.004
Nobody!

16:45.038 --> 16:46.373
In the old country,

16:46.406 --> 16:49.176
only two were allowed to
speak truth to the Don--

16:49.209 --> 16:52.512
his capo and his
interior decorator.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.414
You are lucky.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.815
Now, please leave.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.517
The launch party is tonight.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.253
The Grey Goose people are
bringing a big ice thing.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.856
Well, Anthony, not knowing
what I was designing for,

17:03.890 --> 17:06.059
there's something
I didn't tell you.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.828
Your mother had
a post office box

17:08.861 --> 17:10.697
at this office.

17:10.730 --> 17:14.234
I don't know whether
to believe you.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.074
Oh, looks like a letter
from the pope.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.549
You have surrounded
a blessed letter to your mother

17:29.582 --> 17:31.718
with a bordello!

17:31.751 --> 17:33.720
That's it! Shut it down!

17:33.753 --> 17:36.623
Apologize to our dear
friends at Grey Goose.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.693
So, what are you going
to do with my work?

17:40.727 --> 17:43.230
A little "Italian lightning"
for insurance purposes.

17:43.263 --> 17:47.300
And that is the last question
of yours we will ever answer.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.736
Good-bye, Mrs. Simpson.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.539
Can't you at least wait
until I'm out of the building?

17:52.572 --> 17:55.041
I'm sorry, I get nervous,
I do dumb things.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.110
Maybe it's because
I'm wearing a wire.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.278
Uh-oh.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.415
Now, put your hands together
for the one who's going to win.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.317
Whoops. That's supposed
to be a secret.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.219
Nothing I can do--
in one moment,

18:06.253 --> 18:09.556
Maggie will stop being my little
baby and belong to the world.

18:09.589 --> 18:13.092
I remember her when she
was just a bit of bad news.

18:13.126 --> 18:16.763
Time for the greatest glory
there is... reflected.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.331
AUDIENCE:
Aw...

18:18.365 --> 18:20.267
(sputtering, tuneless blowing)

18:20.300 --> 18:22.001
(blows, grunts)

18:22.034 --> 18:24.771
(indistinct chatter)

18:24.804 --> 18:28.107
Oh, come on, I'm cheating
on my wife to see this?

18:28.141 --> 18:30.177
(blowing raspberries, wheezing)

18:30.210 --> 18:32.345
Look! She's got a
tooth coming in!

18:32.379 --> 18:34.247
That's the kiss of death
for a whistler.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.015
Give me a string
and a doorknob!

18:36.048 --> 18:39.352
That baby is naught
but an overly dramatic,

18:39.386 --> 18:41.521
boring windbag!

18:41.554 --> 18:44.524
A windbag that yields
no succor!

18:44.557 --> 18:47.427
In sum, a nothing!

18:47.460 --> 18:48.961
(beeping)

18:48.995 --> 18:51.030
(audience booing loudly)

18:51.063 --> 18:53.266
What? They're booing my Maggie?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.802
This is the sweetest
little girl in the world.

18:55.835 --> 18:59.071
Nice try,
but no hook can fit me.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.943
This little angel
never makes a fuss.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.778
She always shares her baby food,

19:05.812 --> 19:09.349
and she makes even a despicable
show like this seem sweet!

19:09.382 --> 19:11.618
Hey, pal, this is
a talent show for babies.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.019
We ain't goin' for sweet.

19:16.856 --> 19:20.059
The only thing that's been
worth it about this experience

19:20.092 --> 19:23.630
is that I got to spend time
with this little girl.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.200
And that's the tooth!

19:27.234 --> 19:29.302
HOMER:
Good night, my little star.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.137
And if you have
another amazing talent,

19:31.170 --> 19:34.173
for the love of God,
don't tell anybody.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.042
Nighty-night.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.517
Okay, so I'll never enter Maggie
into another contest

19:44.551 --> 19:47.153
without telling you,
and you'll never design

19:47.186 --> 19:49.589
another sex palace for the mob.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.024
Agreed. No more secrets
from each other.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.926
(yawns)

19:53.960 --> 19:56.162
No more secrets.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.565
(snoring)

19:58.598 --> 20:00.367
(mumbles)

20:00.400 --> 20:02.835
Are you letting out
my pants?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.036
I'm afraid so.

20:04.070 --> 20:07.206
I'm not really a size 32?!
