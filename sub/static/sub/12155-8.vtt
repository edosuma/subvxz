WEBVTT

00:01.513 --> 00:02.686
My fiancee's
family is against me,

00:02.747 --> 00:04.145
<i>so I need you
to take a letter to her.</i>

00:04.213 --> 00:06.245
- It's a matter of the heart.
- I need your help.

00:06.313 --> 00:09.545
- Hide under the table!
- So Hee is a he, but also a she?

00:09.613 --> 00:12.612
- Yes. -Your urine
tested off the charts

00:12.682 --> 00:14.245
for T.H.C.

00:14.312 --> 00:17.668
I've been smoking marijuana
but for medicinal purposes.

00:17.713 --> 00:20.113
A sociopath sent me
three hate letters this week.

00:20.180 --> 00:23.846
I'd like to be a blonde femme
fatale in one of your stories.

00:23.914 --> 00:25.546
I got the money!

00:27.014 --> 00:28.547
I started going to this dungeon

00:28.634 --> 00:31.314
and I need to clear my name
off of their computer.

00:31.382 --> 00:32.982
I'll call you tomorrow, Leah!

00:33.049 --> 00:35.147
Shut up. God.

01:26.664 --> 01:29.129
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:30.364 --> 01:32.331
( Sighs )

01:32.365 --> 01:34.332
So what do you
have to do today?

01:34.366 --> 01:36.166
You want to spend it in bed?

01:36.201 --> 01:37.801
I'd love to, but I can't.

01:37.835 --> 01:39.835
I've got my Midwood
college interview.

01:39.870 --> 01:42.437
- I'm nervous about it.
- I'll hire you.

01:42.471 --> 01:45.906
I think you were
a great teacher.

01:50.843 --> 01:53.110
I've got to say, Nina,
last night was incredible.

01:53.144 --> 01:55.078
- It was an amazing first date.
- I know.

01:55.112 --> 01:57.646
When I get going
I'm like a bee's nest.

01:57.647 --> 02:00.815
So you think I should move in?

02:00.849 --> 02:04.417
- What? - Well, I'm going
to be kicked out of my room

02:04.451 --> 02:08.628
in Bushwick in a few days
and, um, I lost my job.

02:08.654 --> 02:11.988
I might have to go back to
Portland and be with my parents.

02:12.023 --> 02:13.522
You'd leave New York?

02:13.565 --> 02:15.424
But we just met.
We had such a great night.

02:15.458 --> 02:18.459
I know. That's why I
think I should move in.

02:18.493 --> 02:22.228
I already know I want to
be with you every night.

02:22.263 --> 02:24.930
Also, I'm going to be homeless.

02:24.965 --> 02:27.899
God, Nina, this is so sudden.
Um...

02:27.934 --> 02:30.768
Do I have a little time to think
about this... your moving in?

02:30.802 --> 02:32.702
Sure.

02:32.737 --> 02:35.270
Is two days enough time?

02:35.305 --> 02:36.705
I guess.

02:36.739 --> 02:41.108
<i>- ( Cell phone rings )
- Sorry. One second.</i>

02:41.142 --> 02:43.243
- Hello? - You gotta get
over here right now.

02:43.277 --> 02:45.644
I'm having a crisis
and an emergency.

02:45.679 --> 02:48.112
Right now? I'm sort of in
the middle of someone...

02:48.147 --> 02:50.681
<i>- Uh, something.
- Yes, right now.</i>

02:50.715 --> 02:51.948
I need you, okay?

02:51.983 --> 02:54.917
I'll be over there in
five minutes, 10, 15...

02:54.951 --> 02:56.484
Hello?
God damn it.

02:56.518 --> 02:58.085
He always hangs up on me.

02:58.119 --> 03:01.954
<i>As you know, George, we're all
very happy you don't have cancer.</i>

03:01.988 --> 03:04.890
It's just wonderful.
I'm so relieved.

03:04.924 --> 03:07.691
- Thank you.
- But since it was a false alarm,

03:07.726 --> 03:10.427
we do need to do something
about that failed drug test.

03:10.462 --> 03:13.230
But that marijuana
was for my cancer.

03:13.264 --> 03:16.099
The cancer that
you didn't have, George.

03:16.133 --> 03:18.869
Yes, but I didn't
know that at the time.

03:18.903 --> 03:20.336
George, ease.

03:20.371 --> 03:22.371
We're going
to have you evaluated

03:22.406 --> 03:24.340
by our substance abuse expert.

03:24.374 --> 03:26.708
- Oh! - He will determine
a course of treatment.

03:26.743 --> 03:28.843
It'll either be
rehab in Arizona

03:28.878 --> 03:31.179
or an out-patient treatment
here in New York.

03:31.213 --> 03:33.080
Katherine, this is ridiculous.

03:33.115 --> 03:36.649
Rehab?
What about a... a... a sanitarium?

03:36.684 --> 03:37.884
I would do that.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.719
You know, it's more romantic.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.120
It's more Zelda Fitzgerald.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.321
But rehab?

03:43.355 --> 03:45.790
Going to rehab
is company protocol.

03:45.824 --> 03:47.725
We can't make exceptions.

03:47.759 --> 03:49.692
All right, all right, all right.

03:49.727 --> 03:54.296
What if I promised that I would
just quit, go cold turkey?

03:54.331 --> 03:56.165
I wouldn't believe you.

04:00.403 --> 04:03.905
My stalker sent me 12 emails
last night, all of them rude.

04:03.939 --> 04:07.741
And this was left downstairs
in the vestibule this morning!

04:07.775 --> 04:10.443
Oh man, this is really creepy.

04:10.477 --> 04:13.780
There's some sort of a blade
sticking out of your shoulder.

04:13.814 --> 04:15.448
It is a nib
of an x-acto knife.

04:15.482 --> 04:17.283
A nib?
I like that word.

04:17.317 --> 04:18.817
- Nib. Nib. Nib.
- Jonathan!

04:18.851 --> 04:21.253
This is serious!
This is some kind of sick voodoo doll.

04:21.288 --> 04:22.755
We gotta confront this guy.

04:22.789 --> 04:25.224
- He was right here in my building.
- Oh shit.

04:25.258 --> 04:29.027
- What? - He gave Super
Ray a beautiful vagina.

04:29.061 --> 04:33.098
Your stalker is a really talented
seamstress... but no anus.

04:33.132 --> 04:36.668
Give me this!
( Growls )

04:39.574 --> 04:41.739
I'm really sorry
about this, Ray.

04:41.773 --> 04:43.842
Who do you think it could be?

04:46.379 --> 04:48.981
I don't know.
Kevin bacon?

04:49.015 --> 04:51.216
He was weird when I met him.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.185
No, I don't think a celebrity
would do such a thing.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.988
Maybe there's a clue
in the emails.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.491
- What's this?
- That's my Super Ray outfit.

05:01.528 --> 05:03.561
I was going to wear it tonight
at the Brooklyn comic con.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.097
- I thought my fans would like it.
- God, it's strange

05:06.131 --> 05:08.099
that you should make
a Super Ray outfit

05:08.133 --> 05:10.335
and your stalker
should make a Super Ray doll.

05:10.369 --> 05:12.470
It's like when there were
two Truman Capote movies.

05:12.504 --> 05:14.973
This is nothing like that!

05:15.007 --> 05:19.010
We have to find this guy.
Will you concentrate on that, please?

05:19.044 --> 05:21.980
I think we need outside help.

05:22.014 --> 05:24.015
I have a source who owes me.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.184
It's time I collected.

05:28.788 --> 05:31.122
So...

05:31.156 --> 05:33.291
This was left on your door

05:33.325 --> 05:36.160
- at your house?
- Yes.

05:36.195 --> 05:38.463
And there was a nib of an
x-acto knife in the shoulder,

05:38.497 --> 05:39.864
but it fell out
when I threw the thing.

05:39.898 --> 05:41.999
- A nib?
- You can see why we're concerned.

05:42.034 --> 05:43.434
Yes yes.

05:45.904 --> 05:48.306
Do you think that this guy
could make me one?

05:49.975 --> 05:52.210
Okay, it's a doll
with a police uniform...

05:52.244 --> 05:54.145
One of these underneath,

05:54.179 --> 05:56.147
you know, all secret?

05:56.181 --> 06:00.284
This isn't some friend of ours
that custom-makes voodoo dolls!

06:00.319 --> 06:02.119
This is a deranged stalker!

06:02.153 --> 06:04.121
Officer Drake, please!
We need you to focus.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.190
I'm so sorry, fellas.
I really am.

06:06.224 --> 06:09.604
You know I have issues.
I just... Sorry.

06:09.627 --> 06:12.262
Is there any way you can track
down who sent these emails?

06:12.297 --> 06:14.299
Ll, I mean, anybody can open up

06:14.332 --> 06:16.667
a hotmail account.
It's very easy.

06:16.701 --> 06:19.870
But there is, uh, the same unique
IP address on all of these.

06:19.904 --> 06:21.305
You could run a trace

06:21.339 --> 06:23.508
and then you can get a
location on the computer.

06:23.553 --> 06:25.108
Great. That's what we need.
Thank you!

06:25.142 --> 06:28.278
Whoa! Hey! I... I can't
help you, Jonathan.

06:28.312 --> 06:30.346
I would love to,
but I could lose my job.

06:30.381 --> 06:33.149
- I can't do that.
- Office Drake, there were complications

06:33.184 --> 06:35.385
involved in your case
that I never told you about.

06:35.419 --> 06:38.321
But I went to great lengths
for you, as did Ray.

06:38.355 --> 06:40.256
Yeah, it's because of you
I got shot in the head,

06:40.291 --> 06:43.259
then I had to go New Jersey and have
breakfast with Jonathan's parents.

06:43.294 --> 06:46.396
- Oh God. That's awful.
- There's also the matter of my fee.

06:46.431 --> 06:48.398
Oh, I really...
I keep meaning to pay you.

06:48.433 --> 06:50.967
- It's just that every
time I... - Do this for me

06:51.002 --> 06:54.271
and your debt will be canceled.

06:54.305 --> 06:55.939
And you can keep the doll.

06:57.308 --> 06:59.676
- Really?
- Yes.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.378
All right.

07:01.412 --> 07:03.046
Wait here.
Ll be right back.

07:07.919 --> 07:09.953
Cops.
Unbelievable.

07:14.593 --> 07:17.028
If he sticks a pencil
up my twat

07:17.062 --> 07:20.830
and I feel I
I'm gonna regret this.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.208
I knew officer Drake
would come through for us.

07:33.243 --> 07:34.743
This must be it.

07:34.778 --> 07:36.679
Great, it's a public computer.
Anybody could have used it.

07:36.713 --> 07:39.748
I don't think so. Look...
"For patrons only."

07:39.783 --> 07:42.117
- He must be a patron.
- Oh yeah, you're right.

07:42.152 --> 07:44.285
Nobody disobeys
a handwritten sign.

07:48.256 --> 07:51.124
- How much money do you have on you?
- A lot.

07:51.158 --> 07:52.959
The comic book's
selling like crazy.

07:52.993 --> 07:55.295
Good.

08:01.168 --> 08:04.104
We just need to rewind this tape to
the time the last email was sent

08:04.138 --> 08:06.524
and we should be able to get
a good look at our guy.

08:11.645 --> 08:13.746
1:12 A.M.
And look, there he is!

08:13.780 --> 08:16.648
<i>Damn.
We can't see his face.</i>

08:16.683 --> 08:19.251
- Do you recognize this guy?
- I recognize his hat.

08:19.285 --> 08:22.588
He wears it all the time.
He's a guest here.

08:25.625 --> 08:29.595
What's his name
and what room is he in?

08:29.629 --> 08:31.897
- Make it 40?
- Don't push it, clerk.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.168
John Doe-Smith,
are you in there?

08:36.202 --> 08:38.804
- I can't believe he has
such a weak alias. - I know.

08:38.839 --> 08:41.140
The voodoo puppet showed
a lot of creativity,

08:41.174 --> 08:43.442
but his fake name is
definitely lacking.

08:43.477 --> 08:46.412
Though hyphenating Doe-Smith
is sort of interesting.

08:50.283 --> 08:52.217
Anybody home?

08:52.252 --> 08:54.653
Any stalkers?

08:59.025 --> 09:03.062
Oh my God, he's practically
wallpapered this place

09:03.096 --> 09:04.764
with "Super Ray" comics.

09:04.798 --> 09:06.800
He must have bought 0 copies.

09:08.603 --> 09:10.804
It's like you have
your own serial killer.

09:10.839 --> 09:13.006
At least he helped the sales.

09:13.041 --> 09:15.942
You know, Ray, I do have my
Midwood college interview at 5:00,

09:15.976 --> 09:18.578
but we could probably stake this
place out for a little while,

09:18.613 --> 09:20.581
wait and see if he shows up
and then confront him.

09:20.633 --> 09:22.115
Okay.

09:22.150 --> 09:24.184
Do you think it's safe
to eat my stalker's food?

09:24.219 --> 09:27.421
Is it open? If it's open I don't think
we want contact with his germs.

09:27.455 --> 09:29.656
It's not open.
And it's organic.

09:29.691 --> 09:31.492
Then it's probably safe.

09:37.198 --> 09:41.547
So before I begin the evaluation, Mr.
Christopher,

09:41.568 --> 09:43.966
I just want you to know
I'm a big fan.

09:44.001 --> 09:47.536
I read your "by George"
column for years.

09:47.570 --> 09:49.871
Really?
Well, thank you.

09:49.905 --> 09:52.374
Anyway, um,

09:52.408 --> 09:54.810
from your test results,
Mr. Christopher,

09:54.844 --> 09:58.413
it appears your drug
of choice is marijuana.

09:58.447 --> 10:01.316
- Is that correct?
- It's my first choice, yes.

10:01.350 --> 10:04.786
So what does
marijuana give you?

10:04.820 --> 10:09.591
Well, I become more aware of
how beautiful everything is.

10:09.625 --> 10:14.128
And what does marijuana take
away from you, Mr. Christopher?

10:14.163 --> 10:19.367
Off the top of my head, I'd say
boredom, loneliness, pain.

10:19.401 --> 10:22.546
And are you in pain
because you feel unlovable,

10:22.572 --> 10:25.579
unknowable
and shrouded in secrets?

10:31.113 --> 10:36.951
I... I mean I put on a brave
front, and all that,

10:36.985 --> 10:40.021
but you know, inside I
tear at myself with claws.

10:40.055 --> 10:41.789
How do you feel here
at the workplace?

10:41.823 --> 10:43.457
Likeoby-dick.

10:43.492 --> 10:48.228
They stick me
with dozens of harpoons.

10:48.262 --> 10:50.263
So you're clawed on the inside

10:50.298 --> 10:52.432
and harpooned on the outside.

10:52.467 --> 10:56.488
- Yeah.
- That's how I feel.

10:56.504 --> 10:58.238
I suppress a lot of anger.

10:58.272 --> 11:00.073
Secretly,
I'm like a tea kettle,

11:00.107 --> 11:03.076
always ready
to scream out in agony.

11:03.110 --> 11:04.711
What do you do about it?

11:04.745 --> 11:07.480
I pray and I try
to help others,

11:07.514 --> 11:09.381
and I wear a mouth guard
at night.

11:09.416 --> 11:11.384
Oh right right.

11:11.418 --> 11:15.354
Well, I've made my diagnosis.

11:15.388 --> 11:17.256
You're a marijuana addict

11:17.290 --> 11:19.825
with narcissistic
personality disorder.

11:19.859 --> 11:21.541
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

11:21.579 --> 11:23.629
Why the narcissistic part?

11:25.331 --> 11:27.198
Oh, no no.

11:27.233 --> 11:29.233
No, that was a gift.

11:29.268 --> 11:31.369
So I'm recommending
to your superior

11:31.403 --> 11:33.938
that you do two months
of rehab in Arizona.

11:33.972 --> 11:35.772
What? Two months!
Oh no.

11:35.807 --> 11:37.474
That's n possible!

11:37.526 --> 11:39.243
You said you were a fan!

11:39.277 --> 11:41.211
Come on, cut me a deal!

11:41.246 --> 11:43.180
- A deal?
- Well...

11:43.215 --> 11:46.151
Mr. Christopher,
I'm making my prescription

11:46.185 --> 11:48.019
<i>because I'm a fan.</i>

11:50.190 --> 11:52.558
I don't want you to be
in pain anymore.

11:52.604 --> 11:55.160
<i>- ( Door opens )
- Excuse me, Mr. Christopher,</i>

11:55.194 --> 11:57.028
there's something
I really need to show you.

11:57.063 --> 11:59.064
I don't tolerate interruptions

11:59.099 --> 12:01.933
- during therapeutic evaluations!
- What is your name?

12:01.968 --> 12:04.302
What is your name?

12:04.336 --> 12:06.238
It's Steven,
Mr. Christopher.

12:06.272 --> 12:08.207
- With a "v" or a "ph"?
- A "v."

12:08.241 --> 12:09.675
Close your mouth.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.744
Do you think it's crazy
to let Nina move in?

12:11.778 --> 12:14.780
- Yes.
- But the sex was incredible.

12:14.814 --> 12:16.522
It actually felt meaningful.

12:18.051 --> 12:20.186
Then definitely
don't let her move in.

12:20.220 --> 12:22.288
I had meaningful sex
with Leah once a month,

12:22.322 --> 12:25.224
- look what happened to me.
- Right.

12:25.258 --> 12:28.060
- Shit, I better leave soon
for my interview. - Shh shh.

12:28.094 --> 12:30.963
<i>- ( Keys jangle )
- ( Lock clicks )</i>

12:30.997 --> 12:35.067
<i>- ( Cell phone ringing ) - Jonathan:
Oh, he's making a run for it!</i>

12:38.337 --> 12:40.806
- He's heading for the roof!
- Get him!

12:46.044 --> 12:47.845
He killed himself.

12:49.781 --> 12:51.415
Holy shit.
He knows parkour.

12:51.449 --> 12:54.984
That's right. Run, you asshole!
I can find you now!

12:55.019 --> 12:57.988
You hear me, you seamstress?
Seamstress.

12:59.890 --> 13:03.225
- What are you doing?
- Anything your stalker can do, I can do!

13:04.493 --> 13:06.426
Stop! No no no no no.
Oh God God.

13:08.295 --> 13:09.628
Ahh!

13:10.697 --> 13:12.131
Jonathan, are you all right?

13:12.165 --> 13:15.334
I twisted my ankle!
He got away.

13:15.368 --> 13:17.635
I'm sorry I let you down!

13:17.670 --> 13:19.303
You're an idiot.

13:20.972 --> 13:22.739
Thanks for understanding.

13:22.773 --> 13:24.440
Ow!

13:24.475 --> 13:27.143
I can't believe this.

13:27.177 --> 13:29.478
I feel a profound revulsion

13:29.512 --> 13:31.313
in my spine,

13:31.347 --> 13:33.214
in my... in my liver,
in my kidneys,

13:33.249 --> 13:35.950
my gallbladder,
in my... Uh...

13:35.984 --> 13:38.718
What are some other organs?
I'm so upset, I'm blanking.

13:38.753 --> 13:40.188
Is... is the stomach
an organ?

13:40.222 --> 13:42.659
- I-I think so.
- Right, of course, of course it is.

13:42.693 --> 13:47.130
I'm... I'm horrified.

13:47.164 --> 13:49.132
I feel the same way,
Mr. Christopher.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.801
Good boy, good boy.

13:51.835 --> 13:54.303
You know something?
They've been neutering me

13:54.338 --> 13:57.106
for months around here and I'm
not going to take it anymore.

13:57.141 --> 13:58.808
<i>I'm gonna fight back.</i>

13:58.842 --> 14:01.811
Do I, uh...
do I look okay?

14:01.846 --> 14:03.713
Trim and elegant.

14:03.747 --> 14:05.782
Thank you, Walter.
Thank you.

14:21.030 --> 14:23.463
Hello.
I'm Jonathan Ames.

14:23.498 --> 14:25.465
I have an appointment
with Dean Saunders.

14:25.499 --> 14:27.200
You're late.
Have a seat.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.069
- Hello, Jonathan.
- Oh no.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.304
You saw my winning story
in "The New Yorker"?

14:33.339 --> 14:36.073
Oh, you're limping.
That makes me happy.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.566
<i>I'm glad something
makes you happy.</i>

14:38.577 --> 14:41.812
You're not interviewing for the
creative writing job, are you?

14:41.846 --> 14:43.557
Of course I am.
Dean Saunders is a friend.

14:43.596 --> 14:46.782
It seems impossible to fathom,
but is that why you're here?

14:46.817 --> 14:48.417
Yes, Louis, I'm also applying.

14:48.451 --> 14:51.586
Your proclivity for self-destruction
is morbidly fascinating,

14:51.621 --> 14:54.631
but why do you set yourself up
for failure time and time again?

14:54.656 --> 14:56.290
Shut up, Louis.
Don't talk to me

14:56.324 --> 14:58.659
ooh, such anger!
You know, for people like yourself,

14:58.693 --> 15:01.508
there have been amazing
advancements in brain surgery.

15:01.547 --> 15:04.297
A lobotomy is not the mark
of shame it once was.

15:04.331 --> 15:05.698
Snip snip.

15:09.936 --> 15:12.337
- How dare you? Pick it up.
- No, you pick it up.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.372
I will not pick up, for you
will be picking it up.

15:14.406 --> 15:15.707
- No I won't.
- Yes you will.

15:15.741 --> 15:17.408
- No I won't. No I won't.
- Yes you will.

15:17.442 --> 15:19.409
Ow!

15:26.683 --> 15:29.384
Ew! Your breath smells
like cat food again.

15:29.419 --> 15:32.086
It's pate,
you stoner philistine.

15:34.356 --> 15:36.323
We'll be in touch.

15:36.358 --> 15:38.725
Gentlemen.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.194
- Dean Saunders.
- De Saunders.

15:41.228 --> 15:43.763
Louis Greene is next, Dean.
He was on time.

15:45.933 --> 15:47.734
- Come in, Louis.
- Sure. Good to see you.

15:47.768 --> 15:49.936
Thank you.
Snip snip.

15:49.970 --> 15:51.478
, this is wonderful.

15:57.044 --> 15:59.646
Katherine,

15:59.681 --> 16:02.483
I've reached my limit.
This is too much.

16:02.536 --> 16:04.818
It's the final harpoon!

16:04.853 --> 16:07.388
- What? Harpoon? - Never mind.
It doesn't matter.

16:07.422 --> 16:09.423
Look, I just want you
to get on the phone,

16:09.457 --> 16:11.091
call your bosses in Dallas,

16:11.126 --> 16:14.562
and tell them to retract
this garbage immediately!

16:14.596 --> 16:15.830
I can't do that, George.

16:15.864 --> 16:18.534
This... this cover is
important to them.

16:18.572 --> 16:20.200
They won't bend.
I know it.

16:20.235 --> 16:23.070
They want the magazine
to be more on the right.

16:23.104 --> 16:25.839
The right? But the right
doesn't know what to do!

16:25.874 --> 16:29.209
Nobody in American politics
knows what to do.

16:29.244 --> 16:33.047
Well, that's a very pessimistic
viewpoint, George.

16:33.081 --> 16:35.216
No, it's an intelligent
viewpoint:

16:35.250 --> 16:36.684
'Re all idiots.

16:36.719 --> 16:40.456
Now let's just stick with
the opera issue as planned

16:40.498 --> 16:43.693
and just drop this
political bullshit, please.

16:43.728 --> 16:46.029
The cover is staying, George.

16:46.064 --> 16:48.332
Fine.
I will call Dallas myself.

16:48.366 --> 16:52.204
Fine. You can if you want
to, but they'll ignore you.

16:58.112 --> 17:00.313
Wow. Um...

17:00.348 --> 17:02.749
Then I quit.

17:04.053 --> 17:06.054
The magazine doesn't
need me anymore

17:06.089 --> 17:08.691
and frankly I don't need it.

17:08.724 --> 17:13.363
It's a love affair
that's come to an end.

17:16.401 --> 17:19.036
And I'm going to drink
as much booze

17:19.069 --> 17:20.871
and as as much pot as I want.

17:20.905 --> 17:23.172
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

17:24.510 --> 17:26.108
- George...
- No, Katherine.

17:26.143 --> 17:28.077
There's no changing my mind.

17:28.111 --> 17:32.014
- I am sorry.
- No no no, I don't want you to.

17:32.048 --> 17:34.050
I think you're doing
the right thing.

17:34.084 --> 17:37.420
You're not happy he
and I don't blame you.

17:37.454 --> 17:38.788
Right.

17:38.822 --> 17:40.956
So if you'd like,

17:40.991 --> 17:43.628
maybe we could have
dinner sometime.

17:43.660 --> 17:45.360
Now that you're not working her

17:45.394 --> 17:50.164
I'd love to get to know you
outside of the office.

18:11.181 --> 18:14.717
Louis: There, that's his
illegal ad on craigslist

18:14.751 --> 18:17.184
offering his services
as a private detective.

18:17.218 --> 18:20.285
You know, it wouldn't surprise me if
he was also on there as a prostitute.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.386
<i>Saunders:
This is very unusual, Louis.</i>

18:22.421 --> 18:24.086
It's just the tip
of the iceberg.

18:24.121 --> 18:26.454
I once saw him inhale
an entire bag of cocaine.

18:26.488 --> 18:28.187
- Really?
- That's not true.

18:28.221 --> 18:31.221
Also, if you look at him closely
his forehead is very narrow.

18:31.255 --> 18:34.756
Phrenology... skull assessment...
has long been a hobby of mine.

18:38.891 --> 18:41.924
In fact, Dean, your skull has perfect symmetry.
Did you know that?

18:41.958 --> 18:44.497
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't listen to Greene!

18:44.535 --> 18:46.659
- He hates me! - This is what I'm
talking about. He's unstable.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.530
- I'm not unstable. - Obviously there
was some kind of birth trauma.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.896
Oh, and his novel was
full of typos.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.797
I'm going to kill you, Louis!

18:55.000 --> 18:56.801
- Stay away from me, you subnormal.
- Security.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.704
- Stop! - Don't point
your pointy head at me.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.771
My head is normal, u jerk.

19:01.806 --> 19:04.006
Look at yourself!
You're a carnival freak.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.308
Stay away.

19:08.344 --> 19:11.946
Well, I didn't get the job but it was
one of the best interviews I ever had.

19:11.980 --> 19:14.014
One of the security guards
slapped Greene

19:14.048 --> 19:16.149
and I felt joy.

19:16.183 --> 19:17.717
I'm happy for you.

19:17.751 --> 19:22.755
Besides, as a writer and
detective, I'm my own boss.

19:22.789 --> 19:25.924
No one can we're both our own bosses now.
O, you know, without "edition,"

19:25.959 --> 19:28.293
I can do anything I want.
Can open a restaurant.

19:28.327 --> 19:30.795
I can start
an Internet magazine.

19:30.830 --> 19:34.432
I mean, hell, I could finally go
to Tangiers and smoke hashish.

19:34.466 --> 19:36.233
You can come too if you like.

19:36.267 --> 19:37.901
I'd love to.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.337
Am I overdressed?

19:50.611 --> 19:53.012
<i>George:
I am so proud of our Ray.</i>

19:53.046 --> 19:54.446
Yeah, it's incredible.

19:54.489 --> 19:56.913
I think people are responding
so strongly to the comic

19:56.948 --> 19:58.881
because it's all about
his love for Leah

19:58.915 --> 20:00.715
- and wanting to win her back.
- I agree.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.917
It has a beautiful message.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.651
I just want you to know that
your comic really helped me.

20:05.686 --> 20:07.319
So thank you.

20:07.353 --> 20:08.854
You're welcome.

20:11.156 --> 20:13.456
George, you remember
that girl from my class?

20:13.502 --> 20:16.126
- Nina?
- Yes, the cute blonde.

20:16.160 --> 20:20.129
Yeah well, we've started dating and
she already wants to live with me.

20:20.163 --> 20:22.197
Have you ever
let someone move in

20:22.232 --> 20:23.832
right after sleeping with them?

20:23.867 --> 20:27.201
Yes, three times.
Always disastrous.

20:27.236 --> 20:30.268
- So I shouldn't do it?
- Oh no, you should definitely do it.

20:30.303 --> 20:33.803
It could be fun until it,
you know, falls apart.

20:33.837 --> 20:37.337
There's always a slight chance it
could work, so you know, why not?

20:37.371 --> 20:39.771
Oh my God, look at her.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.373
<i>Whoa.
What a costume.</i>

20:42.407 --> 20:44.274
Yeah, I-I have
to go talk to her.

20:44.309 --> 20:47.276
I've always had this thing
for wonder woman.

20:47.311 --> 20:50.612
But I thought you were
into vampires and armpits.

20:53.548 --> 20:58.050
Did you rely put your cock on the
third rail to get your super powers?

20:58.085 --> 20:59.885
Of course I did.

20:59.919 --> 21:01.352
Should I try it?

21:01.387 --> 21:04.555
Yes, but, uh,
wait until you're 21.

21:04.589 --> 21:05.756
All right.
Thank you.

21:15.865 --> 21:18.666
Oh no!
An x-acto knife.

21:22.004 --> 21:24.273
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Hey, watch it!

21:24.308 --> 21:26.375
Hey!

21:47.931 --> 21:50.834
Ray!
Ray!

21:50.868 --> 21:53.570
Ray!
The x-acto knife!

21:56.842 --> 21:59.211
George! George!
The x-acto knife!

21:59.245 --> 22:01.046
<i>Stop talking
to wonder woman!</i>

22:02.381 --> 22:05.951
Ray, I'm coming!
Excuse me. I'm coming, Ray!

22:08.754 --> 22:11.522
It's an x-acto knife!
It's an x-acto knife!

22:11.557 --> 22:13.057
Ow!

22:14.660 --> 22:15.928
Shit!

22:17.732 --> 22:20.169
<i>Woman:
Nice job, man!</i>

22:20.203 --> 22:22.105
- Good job.
- Thank you.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.776
I'll apply pressure
with my handkerchief!

22:24.810 --> 22:27.548
Irwin?
Why did you do that?

22:27.582 --> 22:29.651
Because of you,
I spent two months at Rikers

22:29.685 --> 22:32.222
and I lost my
rent-controlled apartment!

22:34.560 --> 22:36.595
- How bad is that wound?
- Well, it's a...

22:36.629 --> 22:38.999
oh, Ray, that's a lot of blood.

22:39.033 --> 22:40.569
Oh, boy.

22:40.603 --> 22:42.540
Call an ambulance!

22:44.710 --> 22:47.411
I was going to tell you guys,
but it was too embarrassing.

22:47.445 --> 22:49.780
I found Irwin

22:49.814 --> 22:51.748
in bed with Leah.

22:51.783 --> 22:53.317
I chased him out of the house,

22:53.351 --> 22:55.185
but I don't know
how he ended up at Rikers.

22:55.219 --> 22:56.753
Well, the guy
must have cracked;

22:56.787 --> 22:59.355
rent-controlled apartments
are hard to come by.

22:59.390 --> 23:01.484
I had a beautiful one
in the West Village

23:01.498 --> 23:05.162
on Jane Street for years...
it was like $300 a month.

23:05.196 --> 23:08.065
Nobody gives a shit about your
rent-controlled apartment right now, George.

23:08.099 --> 23:09.599
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

23:09.634 --> 23:12.135
Jonathan.

23:13.505 --> 23:15.072
I want to thank you.

23:15.106 --> 23:17.674
If that guy had sta't me
again, I wouldn't be here.

23:20.111 --> 23:22.112
God! Oh my God!
Ray!

23:22.146 --> 23:23.880
Are you all right?

23:25.149 --> 23:26.750
I'm okay.

23:26.784 --> 23:30.253
I'm okay. I've lost a lot of blood.
I got two stitches, but it's nothing.

23:30.288 --> 23:31.888
No no, it was a lot of blood.

23:31.922 --> 23:33.523
God!
This is all my fault!

23:33.557 --> 23:36.865
Irwin was arrested that night in
park slope for indecent exposure.

23:37.294 --> 23:39.629
I never should have
slept with him.

23:39.663 --> 23:41.398
I'm so, Ray.

23:41.432 --> 23:43.266
It's okay.

23:43.301 --> 23:45.001
E I could forgive you anything, Leah.

23:45.035 --> 23:48.204
- Ow! Ow ow ow.
- Sorry sorry!

24:01.553 --> 24:03.721
I love you, Ray.

24:03.755 --> 24:05.389
I love you.

24:12.797 --> 24:15.665
( Bed humming )

24:18.067 --> 24:21.035
George, do you really want
to go to Tangiers together?

24:21.069 --> 24:22.937
Yes, I'd like to.

24:22.971 --> 24:25.972
Or we could go to Azil,
go up the Amazon.

24:26.007 --> 24:29.110
They have plants you can eat
there, that give you visions.

24:29.145 --> 24:32.715
- I'd like a vision.
- Yeah, me too.

24:32.749 --> 24:34.751
I'd like a really good vision.

24:34.785 --> 24:36.620
But what do you
wanna do tonight?

24:36.655 --> 24:41.025
Well, let's get stoned

24:41.060 --> 24:43.027
and get something
to eat in Brooklyn.

24:43.061 --> 24:46.097
It's not the Amazon,
but we can make it lively.
