Good night. Thank you.

03:03.731 --> 03:05.596
Thank you...

03:05.733 --> 03:07.894
Something good?

03:14.175 --> 03:16.109
Thank you.

03:25.786 --> 03:28.653

03:34.061 --> 03:35.926
Thank you.
Have a nice stay with us.

03:36.063 --> 03:37.997
This way.

03:39.100 --> 03:40.965
Mr. Harris,
welcome to Park Hyatt Tokyo.

03:41.102 --> 03:42.967
Thank you.
Enjoy your stay with us.

03:43.104 --> 03:45.038
Thank you very much.

04:16.904 --> 04:21.966
I'm in your arms

04:22.108 --> 04:27.741
And you are kissing me

04:27.882 --> 04:31.477
But there seems to be

04:33.621 --> 04:37.148
Finish this drink, then
we'll go to a jazz club. Yeah.

04:37.291 --> 04:39.555
You see that guy?
Yeah.

04:39.694 --> 04:42.060
You know who that is?
It's not him.

04:42.196 --> 04:44.562
It looks like him,
but it's not him.

04:44.699 --> 04:47.566
Can you believe it?
Okay, maybe it is.

04:47.702 --> 04:50.569
He's here with us. I'm gonna go talk to him.
Shut up. Shut up.

04:50.705 --> 04:53.572
Bob? Bob Harris?
You're awesome, man!

04:53.708 --> 04:55.573
Sunset Odds.
Loved it.

04:55.710 --> 04:58.076
Man, that car chase...
I couldn't believe it.

04:58.212 --> 05:01.079
Four buses... And he took that thing
and everything exploded.

05:01.215 --> 05:05.015
I heard he did his own driving.
Did you do your own driving?

05:05.152 --> 05:07.017
I did.
Cool.

05:07.154 --> 05:10.021
So, what are you doing here?
Yeah.

05:10.157 --> 05:12.022
Um, seeing friends.
Seeing friends.

05:12.159 --> 05:14.024
Yeah? Great.

05:14.161 --> 05:16.026
We're here on business.

05:16.163 --> 05:18.028
I can see it in your eyes
Later.

05:18.165 --> 05:20.099
See you, Bob.
Keep it up.

06:22.163 --> 06:24.097
Are you awake?

06:27.835 --> 06:29.769
John.

06:32.340 --> 06:34.205
Go to sleep.

07:17.151 --> 07:19.085
Aah.

07:37.571 --> 07:40.836
Moshi moshi.

07:40.975 --> 07:43.842
All ri...
Yeah, I'm coming down.

07:43.978 --> 07:45.843
Okay.

07:45.980 --> 07:49.245
I gotta go to work.
Okay.

07:49.383 --> 07:52.250
I love you. I'll see you later.
Okay. Bye.

08:55.015 --> 08:57.210
Mr. Bob-san.

09:03.524 --> 09:06.789
Suntory whiskey.

09:18.005 --> 09:19.870
Casablanca. Bogie.

09:20.007 --> 09:22.942
Suntory time.

09:23.077 --> 09:26.740
Um, he want you to turn,
look in camera.

09:26.881 --> 09:29.406
Okay?

09:29.550 --> 09:31.814
That's all he said?
Yes.

09:31.952 --> 09:33.886
Turn to camera.

09:36.357 --> 09:39.520
All right, does he want me
to... to... turn from the right,

09:39.660 --> 09:41.958
or... turn from the left?

10:06.720 --> 10:09.712
Passionate. Camera. Passion.

10:09.857 --> 10:12.883
Right side,
and, uh, with intensity.

10:13.027 --> 10:14.892
Okay?

10:15.029 --> 10:17.998
Is that everything? I mean, it seemed
like he said quite a bit more than that.

10:20.134 --> 10:21.999
Whiskey.

10:26.206 --> 10:28.265
Gently.

10:29.410 --> 10:31.401
Tension.

10:31.545 --> 10:34.139
Like an old friend,
and into the camera.

10:35.416 --> 10:37.281
Okay.

10:37.418 --> 10:39.682
Whiskey.

10:39.820 --> 10:42.653
It's Suntory time! Okay?

10:42.790 --> 10:46.157
- Okay.
- Okay?

10:48.495 --> 10:50.986
- Hey, come on!
Come on, come on, come on.

10:58.772 --> 11:01.536
For relaxing times,

11:01.675 --> 11:03.540
make it Suntory time.

11:04.645 --> 11:07.341
Cut-o!
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

11:17.191 --> 11:19.352
Uh, could you do it slower...

11:19.493 --> 11:23.122
and with more... intensity?

11:27.334 --> 11:29.268
Suntory time.

11:45.452 --> 11:47.682
For relaxing times,

11:49.556 --> 11:51.717
make it Suntory time.

11:55.696 --> 11:58.164
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

13:14.074 --> 13:15.939
Hello?

13:16.076 --> 13:17.941
Lauren?

13:18.078 --> 13:19.943
Charlotte! Hey!

13:20.080 --> 13:21.945
Hey.
Oh, my God. How's Tokyo?

13:22.082 --> 13:24.516
It's great here.
It's really great.

13:24.651 --> 13:28.280
Um, I don't know...
I went to this shrine today.

13:28.422 --> 13:30.583
And, um,

13:30.724 --> 13:33.591
there were these monks
and they were chanting.

13:33.727 --> 13:37.663
And I didn't feel anything.
You know?

13:37.798 --> 13:40.289
And, um, I don't know...

13:40.434 --> 13:44.996
I even tried ikebana,
and John is using these hair products.

13:45.139 --> 13:48.631
I just... I don't know who I married.
Look, can you wait a second?

13:48.776 --> 13:51.210
Just hold on. I'll be right back.
Okay, sure.

13:52.279 --> 13:54.144
Sorry.
What were you saying?

13:54.281 --> 13:56.647
Nothing. It's okay.
I'll call you later. Okay?

13:56.784 --> 13:59.651
Okay. Have the best time.
Just call me when you get back.

13:59.787 --> 14:01.721
Bye.
Love you. bBye.

15:09.289 --> 15:11.154
God!

15:16.096 --> 15:18.462
At the fitting today,
they had all these...

15:18.599 --> 15:20.464
rock and roll clothes,

15:20.601 --> 15:22.967
but the band
wasn't tough at all.

15:23.103 --> 15:25.970
The label guy just kept saying,
"More lock and loll,"

15:26.106 --> 15:29.473
but it's just so much better if they're just
skinny and nerdy like they came in, you know.

15:29.610 --> 15:33.068
They're making them wear all these
Keith Richards clothes, and it's just ridiculous.

15:33.213 --> 15:36.080
They should let them be who they are.
Don't you think?

15:36.216 --> 15:38.047
Yeah.

15:38.185 --> 15:40.085
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying.

15:40.220 --> 15:42.711
But then you try to...
I mean, you know...

15:42.856 --> 15:44.721
That's what I think.

15:44.858 --> 15:46.792
Do you think this is done?

15:49.096 --> 15:51.963
I don't know. I don't know.

15:54.268 --> 15:57.829
Would you... Would you
please stop smoking?

15:57.971 --> 16:00.269
I like to.
I don't really smoke that much.

16:00.407 --> 16:02.637
It's just so bad for you,
though.

16:02.776 --> 16:04.710
Well, I'll stop later.

16:17.291 --> 16:20.158
Welcome back, Mr. Harris.
Yes, Mr. Harris.

16:20.294 --> 16:22.626
Please. Thank you.

17:03.804 --> 17:05.328
Mr. Harris?
Yes?

17:05.472 --> 17:07.337
Mr. Kazu sent me.
Oh?

17:07.473 --> 17:09.407
May I enter?

17:10.810 --> 17:12.744
Thank you.

17:12.878 --> 17:15.074
Do you like massage?

17:15.214 --> 17:19.015
I don't think
I... I like massage anymore.

17:19.152 --> 17:22.952
Mr. Kazu sends
premium fantasy.

17:23.089 --> 17:26.719
My stockings... "lip" them.

17:28.261 --> 17:32.197
"Lip" my stockings.

17:33.433 --> 17:35.298
Yes, please.

17:35.435 --> 17:37.426
"Lip" them.

17:37.571 --> 17:39.436
What?

17:39.573 --> 17:41.507
"Lip" them.

17:43.210 --> 17:45.075
Hey! "Lip" my stocking!

17:45.212 --> 17:48.238
Hey! "Lip" them?
"Lip" them? What?

17:48.382 --> 17:51.044
"Lip" them. Like this.
"Lip" them.

17:51.184 --> 17:53.049
Rip them?
"Lip," yes.

17:53.186 --> 17:56.053
You want me
to rip your stockings?
Yes, "lip" my stockings, please.

17:56.189 --> 17:59.556
Rip your stockings. You want me to rip
your stockings. Yes. Please? Please? Please?

17:59.693 --> 18:03.595
All right, I'm gonna rip your stockings,
and you tell Mr. Kazu we had a blast.

18:03.730 --> 18:06.221
Oh, no! Mr. Harris!
Oh, my God!

18:06.366 --> 18:08.231
Don't touch me!

18:08.368 --> 18:11.565
Mr. Bob Harris,
don't touch me!

18:11.705 --> 18:13.570
Just "lip" my stocking!

18:13.707 --> 18:16.437
Oh, no, Mr. Harris!

18:16.576 --> 18:20.137
Oh, no! Help! Help!
Yeah... Yeah.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.145
Help, please! Help, please!
Okay.

18:22.282 --> 18:24.648
Mr. Harris, help, please.
Careful with those.

18:24.785 --> 18:27.447
Oh! Help, please! Help, please!
Come on. Come on.

18:27.587 --> 18:30.249
Let me go, Mr. Harris!

18:30.390 --> 18:32.585
Oh, no! Let me go!
Come on. Come on.

18:32.726 --> 18:36.321
Ohh! Let me go! Let me go.
Oh, crap.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.055
Please let me go.
With pleasure.

18:38.198 --> 18:41.998
Oh, no, Mr. Bob Harris,
don't let me go! No!

18:42.135 --> 18:46.003
No! Oh, no,
Mr. Bob Harris!

18:46.139 --> 18:48.539
Ohh! Oh, please.

18:48.675 --> 18:50.609
Let me go, please!

19:36.256 --> 19:39.384
Mr. Harris! Good morning.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.016
Hi.

19:41.161 --> 19:45.029
We just got a request from Tanabe Mori.
He is the Johnny Carson of Japan.

19:45.165 --> 19:48.862
It is a big honor
to be invited to his show.

19:49.002 --> 19:50.731
Can you stay here
until Friday?

19:50.871 --> 19:54.637
Uh, I'm surprised and honored, but I think
I need to check with my agent.

19:54.774 --> 19:57.641
Okay, I believe I may have
a previous commitment.

19:57.777 --> 19:59.642
Sure.
I understand.

19:59.779 --> 20:01.713
Shall we go?
Yes.

20:23.336 --> 20:26.430
I think you should do it.
No, hear this, Fred.

20:26.573 --> 20:29.269
I gotta be on a plane
Thursday night.

20:29.409 --> 20:31.274
We're looking into it, Bob.

20:31.411 --> 20:34.278
They really want you to stay
and do that talk show.

20:34.414 --> 20:36.279
Apparently,
he's a really big deal...

20:36.416 --> 20:39.078
Johnny Carson of Japan.
Yeah.

20:39.219 --> 20:42.586
Bob, these people
are paying you a lot.
Would you please consider it?

20:42.722 --> 20:45.589
I already have.
I-I gotta get out of here.

20:45.725 --> 20:47.590
As soon as I can.

20:47.727 --> 20:51.595
All right, you're scheduled to leave Friday,
but we'll hold it for you Saturday.

20:51.731 --> 20:55.258
You're breaking up, Fred.
There's no reception in this studio.

20:55.402 --> 20:57.336
Forget it.
Call me back.

21:05.178 --> 21:08.409
So, can you put your hand
close your face, please?

21:08.548 --> 21:10.140
I'm sorry, Naka. What?

21:10.283 --> 21:14.879
Can you put your hand
close your face?

21:18.258 --> 21:20.658
I don't get that close to the glass
until I'm on the floor.

21:20.794 --> 21:22.659
How's this?

21:22.796 --> 21:25.162
Yes.
You want a whiskey?

21:27.901 --> 21:31.393
This is not whiskey. This is iced tea.
If you gave me real whiskey...

21:31.538 --> 21:33.403
I need mysterious face.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.770
Can you show mysterious?
Mysterious.

21:35.909 --> 21:38.605
I think I know what you want.
You want this, right?

21:38.745 --> 21:40.940
I need more mysterious and, uh...

21:41.081 --> 21:45.518
More mysterious. Yeah. I'll just try to think,
"Where the hell's the whiskey?"

21:48.455 --> 21:51.185
You are a movie star, yes?

21:51.324 --> 21:55.192
Yes, I should be doing movies, yes, but...
And "Lat Pack. "

21:55.328 --> 21:57.853
"Lat Pack. "
You know "Lat Pack"?

21:57.998 --> 21:59.863
Rat P... Rat Pack?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.264
Rat Pack. Yes, please.
Oh, right, right.

22:07.607 --> 22:10.474
I need more tension, please.

22:10.610 --> 22:12.544
More t...

22:15.682 --> 22:18.048
You so gentleman, yes?

22:18.184 --> 22:20.118
A-ring-a-ding-ding.
Yeah.

22:21.121 --> 22:23.453
"Sinatora. "
You know "Sinatora"?

22:25.025 --> 22:26.890
Old Blue Eyes.
Yeah.

22:27.027 --> 22:28.858
That's good.
Yeah.

22:28.995 --> 22:32.522
That's more of Dino. That's Dino.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:32.666 --> 22:34.531
Great.

22:34.668 --> 22:37.228
Joey Bishop would you like?
Yes. Just change film.

22:42.876 --> 22:44.639
Are you drinking?
No?

22:44.778 --> 22:46.643
Am I drinking?
As soon as I'm done.

22:46.780 --> 22:48.975
Okay, close your hand,
please.

22:49.115 --> 22:50.980
Close your hand.
Yeah... Close it?

22:51.117 --> 22:52.982
Yes.
Close your face, please.

22:53.119 --> 22:55.246
Close my...
Yes. Sorry.

22:55.388 --> 22:58.380
And, uh, 007?

22:58.525 --> 23:01.688
He drinks martinis, but okay, I got it.
007, yeah.

23:01.828 --> 23:03.295
"Loger" Moore?

23:03.430 --> 23:05.159
"Loger"Moore?
"Loger" Moore.

23:05.298 --> 23:07.630
You know "Loger" Moore?
Roger Moore?

23:07.767 --> 23:10.167
Yeah.
Okay. I... I...

23:10.303 --> 23:12.567
- I always think of Sean Connery. Seriously.
- No, no.

23:12.706 --> 23:16.164
Didn't you get the Sean Connery one over here?
No. "Loger" Moore.

23:16.309 --> 23:18.174
Yes.

23:18.311 --> 23:20.302
"Loger" Moore?
No...

23:20.447 --> 23:22.711
Yeah. Okay.

23:22.849 --> 23:25.443
Yeah, okay. Good.

23:25.585 --> 23:27.553
More. Please.

23:27.687 --> 23:30.383
You mean "more," or "Roger Moore"again?
Yeah. Yeah.

23:30.523 --> 23:33.390
Good.

23:33.526 --> 23:35.460
And sexy!

23:41.468 --> 23:44.960
Are you going

23:46.039 --> 23:49.475
To Scarborough Fair

23:53.747 --> 23:56.910
Parsley, sage

23:57.050 --> 23:59.883
Rosemary

24:00.019 --> 24:03.318
And thyme

24:03.456 --> 24:05.447
He's really sad.

24:10.296 --> 24:12.764
Thank you.
We're glad to be here.

24:12.899 --> 24:14.833
We're Sausalito.

24:28.381 --> 24:32.181
They're beautiful. They're beautiful, yeah.
You know?

24:32.318 --> 24:35.776
Send these over
to that table over there.

24:35.922 --> 24:37.787
Old temple?
An old temple?

24:37.924 --> 24:39.789
Yeah.
Oh, beautiful, man.

24:39.926 --> 24:43.293
Excuse me, sir.
From the woman over there.

24:43.430 --> 24:45.660
Oh! Oh, th-they are?
Really?

24:45.799 --> 24:47.664
Yeah, yeah.
Wh-What's... What's...

24:47.801 --> 24:50.133
Is Japan...
Is it mainly Buddhism here?

24:50.270 --> 24:53.364
Yeah, it's Buddhism.

24:53.506 --> 24:55.371
CD or...

24:55.508 --> 24:57.373
Yeah, CD.
Playing her...

24:57.510 --> 25:00.536
Oh, she plays... guitar?
Guitar. Guitar.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.012
That's a beautiful job.

25:36.316 --> 25:38.181
Help!

26:01.641 --> 26:03.438
Good morning.
Good morning.

26:03.576 --> 26:05.441
Good morning.
Good morning.

26:05.578 --> 26:07.512
Are you okay?
Yeah. Fine.

26:08.815 --> 26:10.908
Car is outside.
Shall we go?

26:14.888 --> 26:16.753
That's what I told him.

26:18.892 --> 26:21.258
He never listens.
Yeah.

26:23.563 --> 26:25.121
John?

26:25.265 --> 26:28.530
Oh, my God! John!
What are you doing here?

26:28.668 --> 26:32.695
Uh, oh, w-well, you know, uh, w...
I'm just here, uh, shooting a band.

26:32.839 --> 26:35.364
What about you?
I'm here promoting that action movie I did.

26:35.508 --> 26:39.137
Hyah! You know!
I'm doing 20 million interviews a day.

26:39.279 --> 26:41.144
It's crazy.

26:41.281 --> 26:43.476
God, it is so good to see you!
Yeah. Yeah.

26:43.616 --> 26:47.052
So, how long are you gonna be here?
We're here for a week.

26:47.186 --> 26:49.051
I'm gonna go shoot
in Fukawaka.

26:49.188 --> 26:51.053
Oh, it's amazing!

26:51.190 --> 26:53.090
Yeah. Oh. Oh, yeah.
It's amazing.

26:56.429 --> 26:59.421
You know... Oh, this is...
this is my wife, Charlotte.

26:59.566 --> 27:02.364
Hi! It's really nice to meet you!
Hi. Nice to meet you.

27:02.502 --> 27:04.561
Hello!
Yeah!

27:04.704 --> 27:06.797
Wife?
Yeah. Yeah.

27:06.940 --> 27:09.135
John. John.

27:09.275 --> 27:11.140
You are
my favorite photographer.

27:11.277 --> 27:14.246
Oh, come on!
No, you are. I only want you to shoot me.

27:16.382 --> 27:18.247
It's true!

27:18.384 --> 27:20.852
I have the worst B.O. Right now.
I'm so sorry.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.581
No, no, no.
But, listen, um...

27:23.723 --> 27:26.453
- Let's all go out for a drink sometime.
- Yeah.

27:26.593 --> 27:29.460
You know? Call me. Okay?
Yeah. Okay.

27:29.596 --> 27:31.461
Listen,
I'm under Evelyn Waugh.

27:31.598 --> 27:33.463
Shh. Okay?

27:33.600 --> 27:35.124
Okay. Yeah.

27:35.268 --> 27:37.099
Okay, arigato, arigato.

27:37.236 --> 27:39.704
Moshi moshi!

27:39.839 --> 27:41.704
Evelyn Waugh?

27:41.841 --> 27:44.036
What?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.

27:44.177 --> 27:46.111
Oh, come on.
She's nice.

27:47.347 --> 27:50.612
What? You know...
You know, not everybody went to Yale.

27:51.751 --> 27:54.276
It was just a pseudonym,
for Christ's sake.

27:54.420 --> 27:56.285
Why do you
have to defend her?

27:56.422 --> 27:59.789
Well, why do you have to point out
how stupid everybody is all the time?

27:59.926 --> 28:02.053
I thought it was funny.
Forget it.

28:02.195 --> 28:04.060
Well...

28:04.197 --> 28:07.564
Hey, John, we gotta go.
Oh. Yeah.

28:07.700 --> 28:09.634
Bye.

28:11.971 --> 28:15.202
Did you ever wonder
what your purpose in life is?

28:15.341 --> 28:18.868
This book is about finding
your soul's purpose or destiny.

28:19.012 --> 28:22.743
Every soul has its path,
but sometimes that path is not clear.

28:22.882 --> 28:27.546
The Inner Map Theory is an example
of how each soul begins with an imprint,

28:27.687 --> 28:31.088
all compacted into a pattern
that has been selected by your soul...

28:31.224 --> 28:33.522
before you've even gotten here.

28:37.664 --> 28:41.691
You know, I guess the reason
why I like Japan the best...

28:41.834 --> 28:43.699
out of all Asian countries...

28:43.836 --> 28:48.500
is because I really feel
close to, um, Buddhism.

28:48.641 --> 28:50.836
I really feel...
I really believe in reincarnation.

28:50.977 --> 28:53.844
That's part of what drew me
to Midnight Velocity as well,

28:53.980 --> 28:57.472
because although Keanu dies,

28:57.617 --> 28:59.482
he eventually
gets reincarnated.

28:59.619 --> 29:03.180
So there's hope...
There's hope in reincarnation, I think.

29:03.322 --> 29:06.189
What was it like working
with Keanu Reeves?

29:06.325 --> 29:09.726
He was always so...
He was always, you know, giving me ideas...

29:09.862 --> 29:11.727
and, you know, really helpful.

29:11.864 --> 29:13.729
He made me feel
really comfortable, so...

29:13.866 --> 29:17.529
And we both have two dogs,
and we both live in L.A.,

29:17.670 --> 29:20.798
so we have all these
different things in common.

29:20.940 --> 29:23.807
So, you know, we both
really like Mexican food...

29:23.943 --> 29:26.104
and yoga and...

29:26.245 --> 29:28.110
karate!

29:28.247 --> 29:32.149
Mexican food. Yoga.

29:49.502 --> 29:52.198
Konnichi wa.
Hello. Hi.

29:55.641 --> 29:58.166
okay.

30:05.918 --> 30:07.852
Okay.

30:11.257 --> 30:13.191
Okay.

30:18.965 --> 30:22.992
Hai. Okay. Hai. Hai.
Okay.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.737
He got married
a couple of times...

31:37.877 --> 31:39.742
To some nice women.

31:39.879 --> 31:43.246
Beautiful women too. I mean, you and I
would be crazy for these women.

31:43.382 --> 31:45.748
But there were
always rumors.

31:45.885 --> 31:47.750
I never liked his acting,

31:47.887 --> 31:50.754
so I never gave a damn
whether he was straight or not.

31:50.890 --> 31:53.757
Thank you... Hi.
Thanks.

31:53.893 --> 31:55.758
What can I get you?

31:55.895 --> 31:58.455
Um, I'm not sure.

32:00.967 --> 32:03.527
For relaxing times,
make it...

32:03.669 --> 32:05.603
Suntory time.

32:07.340 --> 32:10.036
Um, I'll have a vodka tonic.

32:10.176 --> 32:12.110
Thanks.

32:17.516 --> 32:19.450
So, what are you
doing here?

32:20.620 --> 32:22.986
Uh, a couple of things.

32:23.122 --> 32:26.751
Taking a break from my wife,
forgetting my son's birthday,

32:26.893 --> 32:29.157
and, uh, getting paid
$2 million...

32:29.295 --> 32:31.786
to endorse a whiskey...

32:31.931 --> 32:34.866
when I could be doing
a play somewhere.

32:36.135 --> 32:38.365
Oh.

32:38.504 --> 32:40.870
But the good news is,
the whiskey works.

32:48.381 --> 32:50.747
What are you doing?

32:50.883 --> 32:53.408
Um, my husband's
a photographer,

32:53.552 --> 32:56.419
so he's here working and, uh,

32:56.555 --> 32:58.921
I wasn't doing anything,
so I came along.

32:59.058 --> 33:02.926
And we have some friends that live here.
How long have you been married?

33:03.062 --> 33:04.927
Oh, thank you.

33:05.064 --> 33:07.862
Two years.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.865
Twenty-five long ones.

33:12.405 --> 33:15.272
You're probably just
having a midlife crisis.

33:15.408 --> 33:17.342
Did you buy a Porsche yet?

33:18.744 --> 33:21.474
You know, I was thinking
about buying a Porsche.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.216
Twenty-five years.

33:27.353 --> 33:30.220
That's a...
Well, it's impressive.

33:33.626 --> 33:37.153
Well, you figure you sleep
one-third of your life.

33:37.296 --> 33:39.958
That knocks off eight years
of marriage right there.

33:40.099 --> 33:41.964
So you're down
to 16 and change.

33:42.101 --> 33:43.966
You're just a teenager
at marriage.

33:44.103 --> 33:47.402
You can drive it, but there's
still the occasional accident.

33:47.540 --> 33:50.065
Yeah.

33:50.209 --> 33:52.143
What do you do?

33:56.382 --> 33:58.247
I'm not sure yet,
actually.

33:58.384 --> 34:01.080
I just graduated
last spring.

34:01.220 --> 34:03.017
What did you study?

34:03.155 --> 34:05.020
Philosophy.

34:05.157 --> 34:08.592
Yeah, there's a good buck in that racket.
Yeah.

34:09.695 --> 34:12.219
Well, so far
it's pro bono.

34:14.367 --> 34:17.460
Well, I'm sure you'll figure out the angles.
Yeah.

34:19.871 --> 34:22.966
I hope your Porsche works out.

34:23.109 --> 34:25.873
Cheers to that, huh?
Cheers to that.

34:26.012 --> 34:27.946
Kanpai.

34:37.523 --> 34:39.456
Wish I could sleep.

34:39.592 --> 34:41.525
Me too.

34:48.900 --> 34:52.496
One, two, three,
and okay.

34:53.572 --> 34:55.505
All right.

35:03.249 --> 35:06.514
One, two, three, four.

35:06.652 --> 35:10.144
And one, two, three, four.

35:10.289 --> 35:12.154
And one, two...

36:26.165 --> 36:28.690
Wait! Take me with you!

36:46.485 --> 36:48.851
How'd it go, huh?

36:48.988 --> 36:52.185
Oh, it was good, you know.
I'm tired.

36:52.324 --> 36:55.191
Yeah, I-I-I gotta go downstairs
and meet Kelly for some drinks.

36:55.327 --> 36:59.696
She wants to talk about some photo thing.
Maybe I'll go downstairs with you.

36:59.832 --> 37:01.697
Oh, you wanna come?

37:01.834 --> 37:03.631
Yeah, sure.

37:03.769 --> 37:05.862
Okay. Yeah.

37:07.973 --> 37:10.134
You

37:10.276 --> 37:14.235
Stepped out
of a dream

37:14.380 --> 37:17.907
Everybody is always, like,
"Kelly, you are anorexic. "

37:18.050 --> 37:21.918
And I'm, like, "No, I'm not. "I eat
so much junk food, you wouldn't believe it.

37:22.054 --> 37:23.919
Just because I have
a high metabolism.

37:24.056 --> 37:25.921
Because I thought
you were anorexic too.

37:26.058 --> 37:29.619
Everybody does. Everybody thinks that.
Yeah, 'cause you look so...

37:29.762 --> 37:31.627
Thank you!
I know, but it's...

37:31.764 --> 37:34.062
I mean, I eat whatever.
I have a really high metabolism.

37:34.200 --> 37:37.101
Yeah.
But, um...

37:38.871 --> 37:42.068
My dad
was an anorexic.

37:42.208 --> 37:44.699
Really?
Oh, really?

37:44.843 --> 37:46.708
Yeah.

37:46.845 --> 37:50.713
He, um, fought on the American side
of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.

37:50.849 --> 37:55.047
He was taken prisoner, and the whole time
he was there they tortured him about food.

37:55.187 --> 37:59.283
Every day they told him
they put poison in the food.

37:59.425 --> 38:02.087
So they would always make themselves
throw up after every meal.

38:02.228 --> 38:05.095
That's horrible.
That's terrible.

38:05.231 --> 38:07.222
That's some crazy shit.

38:07.366 --> 38:09.334
You don't think he sounds kinda goofy?
No!

38:09.468 --> 38:13.097
You know that break beat, right?
Well, I been takin' it to some next level shit.

38:13.239 --> 38:16.106
Like, I'll take that and put
a delay on it, so it's like...

38:18.744 --> 38:21.235
So it's, like, evolving,
the beat.

38:21.380 --> 38:25.180
So it, like, sounds hella large
on the track. You know what I'm sayin'?

38:25.317 --> 38:27.182
No.
No?

38:27.319 --> 38:29.150
You don't listen to hip-hop?

38:29.288 --> 38:31.654
Oh, my God!
You guys gotta listen.

38:31.790 --> 38:34.623
I tried this power cleanse.
It's so amazing.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.524
Okay, promise me you'll try it.
Will you try this power cleanse?

38:37.663 --> 38:40.029
I did it last week, and it's amazing.
I'll be right back.

38:40.165 --> 38:42.463
It's so good to get
the toxins out of your body.

38:42.601 --> 38:45.934
With all, like, the pollution,
all, like, the...

38:50.542 --> 38:52.407
Hello.
Hello.

38:52.544 --> 38:55.536
You ever switch seats?

38:55.681 --> 38:58.946
Uh, I like this one.
If I fall, someone will notice.

38:59.084 --> 39:02.019
Yeah.

39:02.154 --> 39:04.281
So, you having a nice time?

39:04.423 --> 39:06.288
Can you keep a secret?

39:06.425 --> 39:09.019
I'm trying to organize
a prison break.

39:09.161 --> 39:12.062
I'm looking for, like,
an accomplice.

39:12.197 --> 39:15.530
We'd have to, first,
get out of this bar.

39:15.668 --> 39:19.536
Then the hotel, then the city,
and then the country.

39:19.672 --> 39:22.539
Are you in, or are you out?
I'm in.

39:22.675 --> 39:24.540
Good.
I'll go pack my stuff.

39:24.677 --> 39:27.407
Get your coat.
See ya.

39:27.546 --> 39:30.743
I hope you've had enough to drink.
It's gonna take courage.

39:36.889 --> 39:40.882
Oh, look.
The label got me these.

39:41.026 --> 39:44.086
Mmm, I love Cristal.
You wanna have some?

39:44.229 --> 39:49.064
Well, I'm...
I gotta go. I mean, I...

39:50.536 --> 39:53.403
Y-You know,
you don't have to stay.

39:53.539 --> 39:56.167
I mean...
You don't have to go, do you?

39:56.308 --> 39:58.173
Well, I...

39:58.310 --> 40:00.676
I know. You're gonna be
working the whole time.

40:00.813 --> 40:05.147
I'll have a much better time here. I'll call
Charlie and those guys. - Yeah! Call those guys.

40:05.284 --> 40:08.651
And I'm gonna be back
on Sunday, and I...

40:08.787 --> 40:10.721
I love you, you know.

40:14.493 --> 40:16.586
Okay?
I love you.

40:20.366 --> 40:22.891
I'll see you. Okay? Yeah, it's just gonna be
a couple of... a couple of days.

40:23.035 --> 40:24.900
Bye.

40:25.037 --> 40:26.971
I love you.

41:31.303 --> 41:32.827
Hello.

41:32.971 --> 41:34.461
Hello.
How are you?

41:34.606 --> 41:36.801
Good. How are you?

41:41.113 --> 41:44.378
It's a cool pool, isn't it?
Yeah, it's nice.

41:45.651 --> 41:47.516
Get any sleep?

41:47.653 --> 41:50.213
Not yet.
How about you?

41:50.355 --> 41:52.220
No. Not yet.

41:52.357 --> 41:54.825
How long you staying for?

41:54.960 --> 41:59.056
I'll be in the bar
for the rest of the week.

41:59.198 --> 42:02.065
Well, that's good.

42:02.201 --> 42:06.001
Um, I'm going out with some friends later,
if you wanna come.

42:07.239 --> 42:10.766
Sure.
Okay. I'll see you later.

42:10.909 --> 42:12.843
Okay.
See ya.

42:16.515 --> 42:18.449
Oop...

42:26.325 --> 42:28.953
"Bob, which one do you want
for your study?

42:29.094 --> 42:31.028
I like the burgundy,
but whatever you want. "

42:43.141 --> 42:45.006
Which one is burgundy?

42:47.479 --> 42:49.344
Hold on!

42:49.481 --> 42:51.415
Hold on.

42:52.651 --> 42:57.384
You really are
having a midlife crisis, huh?

42:57.523 --> 43:00.390
Really?
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

43:00.526 --> 43:05.327
I kept telling myself that I just wanted
to be ready in case we go to war tonight.

43:08.967 --> 43:11.401
My bathroom
is messier than yours.

43:16.341 --> 43:18.206
And it's not like
you're not tryin'.

43:18.343 --> 43:21.278
Here, will you cut the tag out for me?
Sure.

43:23.549 --> 43:26.347
You're too tall.

43:26.485 --> 43:30.945
Uh, anybody ever tell you
you may be too small?

43:31.089 --> 43:34.991
Whose is this? "A Soul's Search:
Finding Your True Calling. "

43:35.127 --> 43:37.618
I don't know.

43:37.763 --> 43:41.255
I have that.
Did it work out
for you, then?

43:41.400 --> 43:43.834
Obviously.

43:45.571 --> 43:47.937
Okay.
Okay.

43:50.075 --> 43:52.168
Where's your shoes?
They're over here.

43:52.311 --> 43:54.643
- Where's your room key?
- It's in my bag.

43:54.780 --> 43:57.647
- And where's your bag?
- It's right here.

43:57.783 --> 43:59.648
Let's go.
Wait!

43:59.785 --> 44:01.946
There's the elevator.
I gotta go.

44:05.324 --> 44:07.189
Hi! How are you?
Hi, Charlie!

44:10.329 --> 44:12.297
Um, Bob,
this is Charlie Brown.

44:12.431 --> 44:15.594
Hi. Nice to meet you.
How are you? Nice to meet you.

44:15.734 --> 44:17.326
- This is Bambi.
- How are you, Bambi?

44:17.469 --> 44:20.802
His real name's Hayashi, but...
Why do they call you Charlie Brown?

44:20.939 --> 44:24.431
Everybody say, "He looks like Charlie Brown."
You know, Snoopy, man.

44:24.576 --> 44:26.806
Oh, I'll be right back.

44:26.945 --> 44:31.279
Bob, over here. These are my friends.
Very beautiful.

44:31.416 --> 44:35.284
She's "B," and she's Rico,
and she's Myumi.

44:35.420 --> 44:37.684
- Myumi. How are you? I'm Bob.
- Oh! Bob.

44:37.823 --> 44:39.723
Bob from
United States, man.

44:39.858 --> 44:42.691
Ahh!
Hi, Bob.

44:42.828 --> 44:45.194
Maybe you'd like to
sing backup for me.

44:45.330 --> 44:47.525
This is my surfing teacher.
- He's your surfing teacher?

44:47.666 --> 44:49.793
Sometime, sometime.
You're a surfer?

45:26.004 --> 45:28.404
Oh, oui, oui.
The emperor's house? Cool.

45:31.943 --> 45:34.776
Yeah?
Yeah.

45:34.913 --> 45:36.778
Oui.

45:36.915 --> 45:40.248
Cool!
Right.

45:40.385 --> 45:42.751
You don't have anything...
Do you have anything b...

45:42.888 --> 45:44.549
Hey.
Hey. How you doin'?

45:44.690 --> 45:47.022
- Good. How are you?
- My Japanese is getting better.

45:47.159 --> 45:49.024
We started speaking English.

45:54.332 --> 45:56.197
Charlie.

46:01.773 --> 46:04.071
Ooh! Get out, guys!

46:04.209 --> 46:07.576
- I'm leaving!
They'll sting!

46:09.081 --> 46:10.981
Whoo!

46:14.786 --> 46:19.223
Who are these guys, anyway?

46:22.060 --> 46:24.824
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

46:26.064 --> 46:27.929
Oh, no.

46:50.155 --> 46:52.020
Hi.

46:52.157 --> 46:54.182
Come on!

46:54.326 --> 46:56.191
Hey, guys! Over here!

46:56.328 --> 46:58.193
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up!

46:58.330 --> 46:59.763
Wait!
Our tour guide!

46:59.898 --> 47:01.832
Hurry up!

47:10.242 --> 47:11.869
Yeah?
Gorgeous.

47:12.010 --> 47:13.773
Gorgeous?
Blonde and black.

47:16.982 --> 47:19.678
Well, it's a feelin'I get

47:19.818 --> 47:22.685
- Cheese. Cheese-o!
- Cheese!

47:25.423 --> 47:27.288
Yeah, yeah... Hi.
It's a feelin'I get

47:27.425 --> 47:29.859
Hi, I'm Hans.
Nice to meet you.

47:29.995 --> 47:31.394
I'm Charlotte.
Nice to meet you.

47:31.530 --> 47:33.395
Hi.
Hi.

47:37.836 --> 47:41.135
Last weekend, I went surfing.
Right.

47:41.273 --> 47:44.765
About seven people, you know.
Some friends.

47:44.910 --> 47:48.971
And we camp over there
on the beach.

47:49.114 --> 47:53.244
In fact, we made a kind of...

47:53.385 --> 47:56.081
Wait. What kind of weed is it?
I don't know.

47:56.221 --> 48:00.749
Baby, when I saw you turnin'
at the end of the street

48:03.028 --> 48:05.189
I knew our time was gone

48:05.330 --> 48:08.163
Into blank pages

48:08.300 --> 48:13.397
Just understand I was afraid
to be a simple guy

48:13.538 --> 48:15.972
I tried my best to smile

48:16.107 --> 48:18.837
But deep inside my heart

48:18.977 --> 48:22.208
I felt like the shell
that a crab comes in

48:22.347 --> 48:25.043
I guess I couldn't
live without things

48:28.153 --> 48:31.054
A fascist regime

48:31.189 --> 48:34.022
It made you a moron

48:34.159 --> 48:36.354
A potential H-bomb

48:37.829 --> 48:39.262
God save the queen

48:40.699 --> 48:42.496
She ain't no human being

48:43.768 --> 48:46.931
There's no future

48:47.072 --> 48:50.633
In England's dreaming

48:53.245 --> 48:56.442
As I walk through

48:56.581 --> 48:59.243
This wicked world

49:00.418 --> 49:03.785
Searchin' for light
in the darkness

49:03.922 --> 49:06.914
Of insanity

49:07.058 --> 49:09.049
I ask myself

49:10.195 --> 49:13.596
Is all hope lost

49:13.732 --> 49:16.257
Is there only pain

49:16.401 --> 49:17.766
And hatred

49:17.903 --> 49:19.894
And misery

49:21.139 --> 49:25.132
And each time
I feel like this inside

49:25.277 --> 49:28.769
There's one thing
I want to know

49:28.914 --> 49:33.715
What's so funny 'bout
peace, love and understanding

49:35.487 --> 49:42.359
What's so funny 'bout
peace, love and understanding

49:43.728 --> 49:46.060
I'm winkin' at ya

49:46.197 --> 49:50.497
Gonna make you, make you
make you notice

49:51.770 --> 49:53.294
Gonna use my arms

49:54.439 --> 49:55.929
Gonna use my legs

49:56.074 --> 49:58.372
Gonna use my style

49:58.510 --> 50:01.775
Gonna use my sidestep

50:01.913 --> 50:04.108
Gonna use my fingers

50:04.249 --> 50:06.979
Gonna use my, my, my
My, my, my

50:07.118 --> 50:09.586
Imagination

50:09.721 --> 50:11.655
'Cause I'm

50:11.790 --> 50:13.883
Gonna make you see

50:14.025 --> 50:17.552
Nobody else here
No one like me

50:19.531 --> 50:21.931
— I'm special
- Special

50:22.067 --> 50:24.194
So special
Special?

50:24.336 --> 50:26.861
I gotta have some of your

50:27.005 --> 50:29.872
Attention
Give it to me

50:30.008 --> 50:32.670
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bob Harris.

50:34.279 --> 50:36.247
Thanks. This is hard.

50:36.381 --> 50:38.315
Oh, Jesus.

50:44.356 --> 50:48.452
I could feel at the time

50:48.593 --> 50:52.051
There was no way of knowing

50:52.197 --> 50:55.928
Fallen leaves in the night

50:56.067 --> 50:59.969
Who can say
where they're blowin'

51:00.105 --> 51:02.869
As free as the wind

51:04.542 --> 51:06.976
Hopefully learnin'

51:07.112 --> 51:11.344
Why the sea on the tide

51:11.483 --> 51:14.816
Has no way of turnin'

51:18.123 --> 51:20.455
More than this

51:21.526 --> 51:26.088
You know there's nothing

51:26.231 --> 51:28.131
More than this

51:29.601 --> 51:33.002
Tell me one thing

51:33.138 --> 51:36.869
More than this

51:37.008 --> 51:41.638
Ooh, there's nothing

52:38.103 --> 52:41.834
Close my eyes

52:41.973 --> 52:45.500
Feel me now

52:45.643 --> 52:47.668
I don't know

52:47.812 --> 52:51.475
How you could
not love me now

52:53.118 --> 52:55.416
You will know

52:55.553 --> 52:59.011
With her feet down to the ground

53:00.592 --> 53:02.457
Over there

53:02.594 --> 53:06.724
And I want you, love, to know

53:07.966 --> 53:10.867
You can't hide

53:11.002 --> 53:13.368
Oh, no

53:13.505 --> 53:16.633
From the way I feel

55:21.699 --> 55:25.260
Hello.
Hey.

55:25.403 --> 55:27.268
Hello, Bob.

55:27.405 --> 55:31.364
Hey, you know, those carpet samples...
you were right about the burgundy.

55:31.509 --> 55:33.500
It wasn't even close.

55:33.645 --> 55:36.614
Blows the others away.
I'm glad you like it.

55:38.449 --> 55:42.943
I saw a great house tonight
that you would've loved, and...

55:43.087 --> 55:46.420
that burgundy would've been good
in this house, really. - Really?

55:46.557 --> 55:49.788
A guy designed his own house
and built it.

55:49.927 --> 55:51.792
Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it.

55:53.798 --> 55:58.030
He's a fashion guy.
All these fashion people were there.

55:58.169 --> 56:01.002
And, uh, there were
Japanese surfers there,

56:01.139 --> 56:05.974
and the guy was playing
really, really, really great music.

56:06.110 --> 56:08.237
I should've found out what it was
and brought some...

56:08.379 --> 56:10.244
I'll bring some back.
I'll try to find out.

56:10.381 --> 56:13.111
That sounds great.
Can you hold on?

56:16.220 --> 56:18.085
You have to have something
for breakfast.

56:18.222 --> 56:21.521
Do you want some cereal?
Tell her I said she's gotta eat something.

56:21.659 --> 56:23.684
I'm just trying to get her
to eat something.

56:23.828 --> 56:26.422
Yeah. Tell her I said
she has to eat something.

56:26.564 --> 56:29.158
Your dad says eat something.
No.

56:29.300 --> 56:34.397
Eat. Tell her I said so.
She won't eat anything. Forget it.

56:34.539 --> 56:36.404
Look, I'm glad you're having fun.

56:37.909 --> 56:41.811
It's not fun. It's just...
It's just very, very different.

56:41.946 --> 56:44.039
Maybe that's good.

56:44.182 --> 56:46.742
Um, I have to get
the kids off for school, okay?

56:46.884 --> 56:48.749
So, can I call you in a while?

56:50.388 --> 56:53.380
I might not be up.
It's-It's, like, 4:00.

56:54.959 --> 56:57.757
Well, you better get some sleep.
You have work in the morning.

56:57.895 --> 56:59.795
No, actually,
they gave me tomorrow off.

57:01.332 --> 57:03.664
That must be nice.

57:06.204 --> 57:09.037
All right. Well, thanks
for checking in. I gotta go.

57:09.173 --> 57:11.698
All right. Have a great, great night.
All right.

57:11.843 --> 57:14.903
I mean, I guess have a great morning, huh?

57:15.046 --> 57:18.038
Good night, Bob.
Good night.

57:18.182 --> 57:21.174
I love you.

57:23.855 --> 57:26.255
That was a stupid idea.

58:36.894 --> 58:39.226
I was feeling tight,
you know?

58:39.363 --> 58:41.263
Shoulders and neck.

58:41.399 --> 58:45.062
So I called down
and, and had a, uh,

58:45.203 --> 58:47.899
shiatsu massage in my room.
Mmm, that's nice.

58:48.039 --> 58:51.668
And the tightness has
completely, uh, disappeared...

58:51.809 --> 58:54.175
And been replaced by...

58:54.312 --> 58:56.177
unbelievable pain.

58:57.815 --> 59:00.545
Just staggering, unbearable pain.
Ooh, that's too bad.

59:00.685 --> 59:02.550
Yeah.
I'm in pain.

59:02.687 --> 59:07.090
I got my foot banged up, and...
Wanna see it?

59:07.225 --> 59:09.659
How do you say no?

59:09.794 --> 59:12.092
Oh, my gosh.
I know.

59:12.230 --> 59:14.698
That's... How...
When did you do this?

59:14.832 --> 59:17.096
I did it the other day.
It hurts, you know?

59:17.235 --> 59:20.363
Didn't you feel any pain? Your...
Yeah, it really hurt.

59:20.505 --> 59:22.735
It was...
Yeah. That toe is almost dead.

59:24.342 --> 59:27.436
I gotta take you to a doctor. You can't
just put that back in the shoe.

59:27.578 --> 59:29.443
No. I don't think so.

59:29.580 --> 59:31.775
Well, you either go to a doctor,
or you leave it here.

59:33.918 --> 59:36.853
He's smiling.
You like that idea?

59:36.988 --> 59:38.853
See, they love black toe
over in this country.

59:38.990 --> 59:41.390
You got a sharp knife?

59:41.526 --> 59:45.360
Gotta be, you know, in this country...
somebody's gotta prefer a black toe.

59:45.496 --> 59:48.090
Uh, "brack" toe.

59:48.232 --> 59:51.099
Or we should probably hang around
until someone orders it.

59:51.235 --> 59:53.260
Hey, what's with the straight face?

59:53.871 --> 59:55.532
Hospital regulations.
Get in there.

59:55.673 --> 59:58.540
All right. Thank you.
All right.

01:00:01.145 --> 01:00:03.807
Careful, okay?
No, don't!

01:00:03.948 --> 01:00:06.883
No!
Hey, use the horn, fella.

01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:14.053
Let's try "mixed internal. "

01:00:14.191 --> 01:00:16.591
Yeah. Switched to beer, huh?
Go.

01:00:16.727 --> 01:00:18.627
Go. Go.
You might want to switch to sake.

01:00:18.763 --> 01:00:20.628
Stop.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.100
Hi.

01:00:25.236 --> 01:00:27.101
Hi.
Hi.

01:00:27.238 --> 01:00:29.570
Yeah. We need a doctor.
Hai.

01:00:29.707 --> 01:00:31.868
For, uh, her...
emergency room.

01:00:32.009 --> 01:00:34.136
It's not an emergency.
I just hurt my foot.

01:00:41.819 --> 01:00:44.754
Okay, do we fill this out?
We go over there?

01:00:44.889 --> 01:00:46.754
Which number?

01:00:52.129 --> 01:00:54.859
We're not going to another hospital,
so whatever you say is okay.

01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:56.864
Okay.

01:00:57.001 --> 01:01:00.368
Could you put that back
in the garage for us?

01:01:29.634 --> 01:01:33.001
Irun desuka.

01:01:34.338 --> 01:01:38.001
"In desuka"?
Irun desuka.

01:01:43.648 --> 01:01:46.276
Nihon ni.

01:01:46.417 --> 01:01:48.351
Japan.

01:01:48.486 --> 01:01:51.114
Japan.
"Appuh. "

01:01:51.255 --> 01:01:53.189
Japan "appuh. "
Japan...

01:01:53.324 --> 01:01:55.884
"Appuh. " "Appuh. "
After?

01:01:56.027 --> 01:01:58.325
Japan...
"Appuh. " Nannen.

01:02:01.499 --> 01:02:03.933
"Nannen. "

01:02:07.438 --> 01:02:12.239
Ahh-ah, so.

01:02:22.486 --> 01:02:24.351
How's that song go?

01:02:37.068 --> 01:02:39.628
Is that for me?

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.635
Yeah, it can be for you.

01:03:14.705 --> 01:03:16.570
Hey, Bob, it's Charlotte.

01:03:16.707 --> 01:03:20.768
Um, I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys
at this place called Orange around 10:00,

01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:23.573
so I'll fax you a map
on how to get there.

01:03:23.714 --> 01:03:26.945
I hope you can come
and meet us. Bye.

01:03:35.426 --> 01:03:37.826
Suckin'on my titties
like you wanted me

01:03:37.962 --> 01:03:40.430
Callin'me all the time
like Blondie

01:03:40.564 --> 01:03:43.328
Check out my Chrissie be-Hynde
It's fine all of the time

01:03:43.467 --> 01:03:45.332
Like sex on the beach is

01:03:45.469 --> 01:03:48.029
What else is in the Teaches of Peaches

01:03:48.172 --> 01:03:50.197
Huh, what

01:03:57.381 --> 01:03:59.747
Suckin'on my titties
like you wanted me

01:03:59.884 --> 01:04:02.546
Callin'me all the time like Blondie

01:04:02.686 --> 01:04:06.918
How long have you been here?
I couldn't say.

01:04:07.057 --> 01:04:09.150
Where's Charlie and those guys?

01:04:09.293 --> 01:04:13.127
Um, they're takin' a dance class.

01:04:13.264 --> 01:04:16.722
Why, what

01:04:21.105 --> 01:04:24.597
What, right

01:04:31.148 --> 01:04:33.173
Can I get you a couple drinks?
Let's go.

01:04:33.317 --> 01:04:35.308
Okay.
Okay.

01:04:35.452 --> 01:04:38.546
Like you wanted me
Callin'me all the time like Blondie
Thank you.

01:04:40.858 --> 01:04:43.088
He's got blockers.

01:04:44.161 --> 01:04:46.356
They've got room to run.

01:04:46.497 --> 01:04:49.057
He's cutting back.
He cut back.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.065
He's dancin'. He's dancin'.
Where'd he go?

01:04:55.072 --> 01:04:57.404
There you are.

01:04:59.677 --> 01:05:01.838
Say "Hi. "

01:05:04.982 --> 01:05:06.847
Hi. You ready?

01:05:08.219 --> 01:05:10.585
Come on.

01:05:10.721 --> 01:05:13.451
Thank you, Tokyo!

01:05:13.591 --> 01:05:18.358
Nobody does it better

01:05:20.731 --> 01:05:25.191
Makes me feel sad for the rest

01:05:28.405 --> 01:05:30.873
Nobody does it

01:05:31.008 --> 01:05:33.772
Half as good as you

01:05:33.911 --> 01:05:37.608
Baby, you're

01:05:37.748 --> 01:05:40.376
The best
You two.

01:05:40.517 --> 01:05:42.781
Both of you.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.252
I wasn't lookin'

01:05:45.389 --> 01:05:49.883
But somehow you found me

01:05:50.027 --> 01:05:55.522
I tried to hide
from your love, yeah

01:07:27.624 --> 01:07:29.922
No, no. Not here.

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.893
It must be over there.

01:07:47.444 --> 01:07:51.244
You know, the first time I saw you,
you were wearing a tuxedo at the bar.

01:07:51.382 --> 01:07:53.646
You were very dashing.

01:07:53.784 --> 01:07:55.752
I liked the mascara.

01:08:01.725 --> 01:08:04.091
But the first time I saw you
was in the elevator.

01:08:04.228 --> 01:08:06.856
Really?
You don't remember?

01:08:09.933 --> 01:08:14.029
I guess you do kind of blend in, huh?

01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:16.298
Did I scowl at you?

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:19.807
No, you smiled.
I did?

01:08:19.943 --> 01:08:23.242
Yes, it was a complete accident.
A freak. I haven't seen it since.

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.109
Just that one time.
Like that, but bigger.

01:08:27.785 --> 01:08:30.549
Bigger. Yeah, big... big...

01:08:30.687 --> 01:08:33.417
Well, not that big.

01:08:33.557 --> 01:08:35.991
My goodness.

01:08:42.099 --> 01:08:45.694
Marcello, come here.
Hurry up.

01:08:49.573 --> 01:08:53.202
Why do they switch
the "R"s and the "L"s here?

01:08:53.343 --> 01:08:57.279
Oh, for yuks.
You know, just to mix it up.

01:08:57.413 --> 01:09:00.281
They have to amuse themselves.
'Cause we're not makin' 'em laugh.

01:09:04.054 --> 01:09:08.081
Let's never come here again,
'cause it would never be as much fun.

01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:13.290
Whatever you say.
You're the boss.

01:09:18.602 --> 01:09:20.968
I'm stuck.

01:09:23.807 --> 01:09:25.968
Does it get easier?

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:28.135
No.

01:09:29.246 --> 01:09:31.372
Yes.

01:09:31.515 --> 01:09:33.608
It gets easier.

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.615
Oh, yeah?

01:09:35.752 --> 01:09:37.720
Look at you.

01:09:38.856 --> 01:09:40.756
Thanks.

01:09:42.225 --> 01:09:44.353
The more you know
who you are,

01:09:44.495 --> 01:09:46.587
and what you want,

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:49.493
the less you let...

01:09:49.633 --> 01:09:51.760
things upset you.

01:09:52.836 --> 01:09:54.701
Yeah.

01:09:55.873 --> 01:09:58.239
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to be.

01:09:59.309 --> 01:10:01.243
You know?

01:10:01.378 --> 01:10:03.243
I tried being a writer, but...

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.245
I hate what I write.

01:10:05.382 --> 01:10:09.182
And I tried taking pictures,

01:10:09.319 --> 01:10:12.550
but they're so mediocre,
you know.

01:10:12.689 --> 01:10:16.523
Every girl goes through
a photography phase.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.220
You know, like horses?

01:10:19.363 --> 01:10:23.265
You know?
Take, uh, dumb pictures of your feet.

01:10:25.936 --> 01:10:29.133
You'll figure that out.

01:10:29.273 --> 01:10:31.798
I'm not worried about you.

01:10:34.444 --> 01:10:36.309
Keep writing.

01:10:41.051 --> 01:10:43.349
But I'm so mean.

01:10:44.688 --> 01:10:47.623
Mean's okay.
Yeah?

01:10:53.797 --> 01:10:56.129
What about marriage?
Does that get easier?

01:11:03.373 --> 01:11:05.568
That's hard.

01:11:10.614 --> 01:11:12.878
We used to have
a lot of fun.

01:11:13.984 --> 01:11:16.976
Lydia would come with me
when I made the movies,

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.112
and we would laugh
about it all.

01:11:22.259 --> 01:11:24.659
Now she doesn't want
to leave the kids, and...

01:11:24.795 --> 01:11:27.593
she doesn't...

01:11:27.731 --> 01:11:30.791
need me to be there.

01:11:30.934 --> 01:11:34.165
The kids miss me,
but they're fine.

01:11:36.907 --> 01:11:40.934
It gets a whole lot more complicated
when you have kids.

01:11:41.078 --> 01:11:43.069
Yeah. It's scary.

01:11:46.516 --> 01:11:49.952
It's the most terrifying day of your life
the day the first one is born.

01:11:51.154 --> 01:11:53.782
Yeah. Nobody ever tells you that.

01:11:55.192 --> 01:11:57.285
Your life,

01:11:57.427 --> 01:11:59.292
as you know it,

01:11:59.429 --> 01:12:01.954
is gone.

01:12:02.099 --> 01:12:03.964
Never to return.

01:12:06.003 --> 01:12:08.836
But they learn how to walk,
and they learn how to talk, and...

01:12:10.407 --> 01:12:13.467
and you want to be with them.

01:12:14.544 --> 01:12:16.910
And they turn out to be the most...

01:12:17.047 --> 01:12:19.174
delightful people...

01:12:19.316 --> 01:12:21.181
you will ever meet in your life.

01:12:21.318 --> 01:12:23.548
Hmm, that's nice.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.665
Where'd you grow up?

01:12:39.936 --> 01:12:42.837
Um, I grew up in New York,

01:12:42.973 --> 01:12:45.942
and I moved to Los Angeles
when John and I got married.

01:12:46.076 --> 01:12:49.944
But it's so different there.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.548
Yeah, I know.

01:12:53.884 --> 01:12:56.250
John thinks I'm so snotty.

01:13:01.158 --> 01:13:03.023
Hmm.

01:13:16.606 --> 01:13:18.471
You're not hopeless.

01:16:43.613 --> 01:16:45.478
Hello?

01:16:45.615 --> 01:16:47.947
Mr. Harris? A fax for you.
Yes.

01:16:48.084 --> 01:16:50.348
Okay.
Can you send it up?

01:16:50.487 --> 01:16:53.945
Do you think you can kick it under
the door, slide it under the door, please?

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:57.253
Do you want I send it to your room?
Just slide it under the door, please.

01:16:57.394 --> 01:17:00.795
Thank you. Okay. All right, bye.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

01:17:35.599 --> 01:17:39.467
Hey, Ms. Kawasaki.
It's Bob Harris.

01:17:39.603 --> 01:17:43.334
Yes, I would love
to do his talk show.

01:17:43.473 --> 01:17:45.338
I would.

01:17:45.475 --> 01:17:48.205
I would love
to change my plans and stay.

01:18:05.996 --> 01:18:07.861
American movie star.

01:18:14.604 --> 01:18:16.697
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.934
Mr. Bob Harris!

01:18:20.076 --> 01:18:23.045
Come on!
Da de da de, da de da dah.

01:18:23.179 --> 01:18:27.309
Da de da dah!
Whoo!

01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:29.315
Come on, Bob.
Come on, Bob.

01:18:29.452 --> 01:18:31.647
Bobby, come on!
Bobby, come on!

01:18:31.788 --> 01:18:34.382
Whoo! Nice to meet you.

01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:40.355
He said you guys are
e-mailing together.

01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:49.834
Ah. He wants to
show you his dance.

01:18:49.973 --> 01:18:52.237
Japanese dance step.
Uh... Uh... Japanese dance.

01:18:52.375 --> 01:18:54.240
Do I... Do I have to
dance with him?

01:18:54.377 --> 01:18:56.572
To-tung a-tung. To-tung a-tung.

01:18:56.713 --> 01:18:59.273
To-tung a-tung. To-tung a-tung

01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:02.249
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby...

01:19:03.319 --> 01:19:06.777
Welcome, Bob. He was saying, "Welcome, Bob."
What?

01:19:46.429 --> 01:19:48.294
Hello?
Bob?

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.628
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?

01:19:54.738 --> 01:19:57.104
No, it's always a good time.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.232
Look, um, your burgundy carpet
isn't in stock.

01:20:00.376 --> 01:20:03.777
It's gonna take 12 weeks.
Did you like any of the other colors?

01:20:07.717 --> 01:20:11.244
Whatever you like.
I-I'm completely lost.

01:20:11.387 --> 01:20:13.252
It's just carpet.

01:20:14.691 --> 01:20:17.922
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?

01:20:20.797 --> 01:20:23.391
I don't know.
I just want to get healthy.

01:20:23.533 --> 01:20:26.263
You know, I want to take
better care of myself.

01:20:26.402 --> 01:20:29.337
I would like to start
eating healthier.

01:20:29.472 --> 01:20:31.599
I don't want all that pasta.

01:20:31.741 --> 01:20:33.606
What?

01:20:33.743 --> 01:20:36.644
I would like to start eating,
like, Japanese food.

01:20:38.014 --> 01:20:40.949
Well, why don't you just stay there,
and you can have it every day?

01:20:46.489 --> 01:20:49.049
How are the kids doin'?

01:20:49.192 --> 01:20:51.752
They're fine.
They miss their father.

01:20:51.895 --> 01:20:54.955
But they're getting used to
you not being here.

01:20:55.098 --> 01:20:57.089
Do I need to worry
about you, Bob?

01:20:59.169 --> 01:21:01.034
Only if you want to.

01:21:02.539 --> 01:21:05.269
Bob, I got things to do.

01:21:05.408 --> 01:21:07.706
I gotta go.
Okay.

01:21:09.512 --> 01:21:11.673
I'll see you...
I mean, I'll talk to you later.

01:21:11.815 --> 01:21:15.478
Okay.
Okay, bye.

01:21:15.618 --> 01:21:17.483
Bye.

01:21:56.693 --> 01:22:00.151
Matthew Smellick!

01:22:00.296 --> 01:22:04.198
Matthew "Snellick. "

01:22:10.573 --> 01:22:12.370
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:22:12.508 --> 01:22:15.136
We'll take a really short break,
and we'll see you in a minute.

01:22:21.784 --> 01:22:24.981
Hi. Uh, champagne.
Thanks.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.625
Hi.

01:22:49.379 --> 01:22:52.507
Midnight at the oasis

01:22:52.649 --> 01:22:55.083
Send your camel to bed

01:22:55.218 --> 01:22:58.779
Shadows paintin'our faces

01:22:58.922 --> 01:23:04.053
Traces of romance in our heads

01:23:04.193 --> 01:23:07.651
Heaven's holding a half moon

01:23:11.968 --> 01:23:13.833
I got it.

01:23:16.339 --> 01:23:18.466
Have a rough night?

01:23:21.144 --> 01:23:24.045
Um, I'm going to that place,
that sushi place in Daikanyama.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.808
You wanna come?
Yeah, but I can't right now.

01:23:28.952 --> 01:23:31.819
Midnight at the oasis

01:23:31.955 --> 01:23:34.515
Send your camel to bed
Yeah, I guess you're busy, huh?

01:23:34.657 --> 01:23:38.354
Shadows paintin'our faces

01:23:38.494 --> 01:23:41.657
Traces of romance in our heads

01:23:47.737 --> 01:23:50.934
Hello?
Hello? Bob, it's me.

01:23:51.074 --> 01:23:54.407
Hello?
It's Lydia, your wife.

01:23:54.544 --> 01:23:56.842
Oh, I'm...
I couldn't hear ya.

01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:00.279
Hey, you want to talk to Zoe?
Yeah.

01:24:00.416 --> 01:24:02.350
Zoe, come say hello
to your father.

01:24:02.485 --> 01:24:04.817
No. Uh, she just ran into
the other room.

01:24:04.954 --> 01:24:07.354
It's okay. It's okay.

01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:10.857
Okay, um, her ballet recital
is Sunday. Don't forget.

01:24:10.994 --> 01:24:12.859
I didn't forget.

01:24:12.996 --> 01:24:15.624
Well, travel safely.
I'll see you soon.

01:24:15.765 --> 01:24:18.256
Mommy!
Okay.

01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:20.733
Okay. Bye.

01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:22.861
Bye.

01:24:33.182 --> 01:24:36.242
Well, she is closer
to your age.

01:24:37.754 --> 01:24:39.949
You could talk about things
you have in common,

01:24:40.089 --> 01:24:41.954
like, um,

01:24:42.091 --> 01:24:43.956
growing up in the '50s.

01:24:44.093 --> 01:24:47.358
Maybe she liked the movies
you were making in the '70s,

01:24:47.497 --> 01:24:50.057
when you still were making movies.

01:24:50.199 --> 01:24:53.532
Wasn't there anyone else there
to lavish you with attention?

01:25:02.278 --> 01:25:04.678
I'm switchin' to beer.
Okay?

01:25:04.814 --> 01:25:06.679
Biru?

01:25:09.786 --> 01:25:12.186
I can't tell the difference.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.094
We'll have
two of these, okay?

01:26:12.315 --> 01:26:15.113
To your nearest exit...

01:26:15.251 --> 01:26:18.379
and leave the building.

01:26:18.521 --> 01:26:21.957
Await instructions
from the authorities.

01:26:43.346 --> 01:26:45.871
That was the worst lunch.

01:26:46.015 --> 01:26:48.279
So bad.

01:26:48.417 --> 01:26:51.147
What kind of restaurant
makes you cook your own food?

01:26:57.793 --> 01:26:59.920
When are you leaving?

01:27:02.665 --> 01:27:04.565
Tomorrow.

01:27:08.671 --> 01:27:10.536
I'll miss you.

01:27:23.519 --> 01:27:27.046
I'm so into you

01:27:37.466 --> 01:27:40.594
When you walked into the room

01:27:41.737 --> 01:27:44.638
There was voodoo in the vibes

01:27:48.878 --> 01:27:51.676
I was captured by your style

01:27:52.848 --> 01:27:56.045
But I could not
catch your eyes

01:28:01.557 --> 01:28:04.549
I don't want to leave.

01:28:04.694 --> 01:28:06.992
So don't.
Stay here with me.

01:28:08.965 --> 01:28:10.990
We'll start a jazz band.

01:28:15.805 --> 01:28:19.241
I am so into you, baby

01:28:40.963 --> 01:28:42.828
Good night.
Good night. Okay.

01:28:42.965 --> 01:28:45.160
Good night.

01:28:53.576 --> 01:28:55.601
Okay.

01:28:55.745 --> 01:28:57.610
Okay. Good night.
Good night.

01:29:31.514 --> 01:29:34.381
Good morning, Mr. Harris. Have a nice flight.
Thank you.

01:29:34.517 --> 01:29:36.382
Thank you.
Good-bye

01:29:37.687 --> 01:29:39.552
I'll be one minute.

01:29:49.899 --> 01:29:53.630
Charlotte, I'm down in the lobby,
and I'm leaving now.

01:29:53.769 --> 01:29:56.237
Um, I was calling...

01:29:56.372 --> 01:29:58.237
to see if you still
have my jacket.

01:29:58.374 --> 01:30:00.672
If you could you bring it down,
but you're not there,

01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:04.906
so this is good-bye,
and, uh...

01:30:06.782 --> 01:30:09.250
So,

01:30:09.385 --> 01:30:12.946
I guess, good-bye and enjoy
my jacket which you stole...

01:30:13.089 --> 01:30:14.954
from me.

01:30:21.764 --> 01:30:23.789
Hello.
Hello.

01:30:23.933 --> 01:30:26.561
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

01:30:26.702 --> 01:30:28.567
Mr. Harris...

01:30:28.704 --> 01:30:32.401
Thank you for coming. Enjoy your, your trip?
I had a great time.

01:30:32.541 --> 01:30:34.406
I had a very good time.

01:30:36.479 --> 01:30:38.709
Excuse me. Ar-Aren't you Bob Harris?
Yes, I am.

01:30:38.848 --> 01:30:42.545
I'm such a big fan. So nice to meet you.
Thank you very much. Nice to meet you.

01:30:42.685 --> 01:30:45.848
What are you doing here in Japan?
I have to go right now. Excuse me one second.

01:30:45.988 --> 01:30:48.047
Oh, okay. Well...

01:30:48.190 --> 01:30:50.317
Hi. Thank you.
Hi.

01:30:50.459 --> 01:30:53.189
You're welcome.
Thought I'd missed you.

01:30:59.969 --> 01:31:02.699
Are you going right now?
Yeah. And my bodyguards are in here.

01:31:10.479 --> 01:31:14.745
All right. Aren't you gonna wish me
"Have a good 'fright,"' or something?

01:31:14.884 --> 01:31:17.444
Yeah, right.

01:31:22.425 --> 01:31:24.518
Okay. Well, bye.
All right.

01:31:26.962 --> 01:31:29.897
- Can I take one more picture?
- Sure.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.295
Hai.

01:31:35.504 --> 01:31:37.734
Hai.

01:32:24.687 --> 01:32:28.316
Hey, hold on here. Let me out.
Thank you.

01:32:49.912 --> 01:32:51.777
Hey, you.

01:33:22.177 --> 01:33:24.042
Okay?
Okay.

01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:49.494
Bye.
Bye.

01:33:49.638 --> 01:33:52.004
Bye.

01:34:08.490 --> 01:34:11.425
Listen to the girl

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:15.690
As she takes on half the world

01:34:15.831 --> 01:34:19.733
Moving up and so alive

01:34:19.868 --> 01:34:23.634
In her honey dripping

01:34:23.772 --> 01:34:25.672
Beehive

01:34:27.676 --> 01:34:31.442
Beehive
It's good, so good

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.311
All right.

01:34:35.451 --> 01:34:37.885
So good

01:34:40.356 --> 01:34:42.950
Walking back to you

01:34:43.092 --> 01:34:46.152
Is the hardest thing that

01:34:47.229 --> 01:34:50.995
I can do

01:34:51.133 --> 01:34:54.967
That I can do for you

01:34:55.104 --> 01:34:58.335
For you

01:34:58.474 --> 01:35:00.908
I'll be your plastic toy

01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:04.975
I'll be your plastic toy

01:35:06.782 --> 01:35:09.478
For you

01:35:11.687 --> 01:35:14.622
Eating up the scum

01:35:14.757 --> 01:35:17.419
Is the hardest thing for

01:35:17.559 --> 01:35:20.153
Me to do

01:35:42.685 --> 01:35:46.451
