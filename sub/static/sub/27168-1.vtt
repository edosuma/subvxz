There are a few seconds

00:34.026 --> 00:36.256
between this life and the next.

00:37.930 --> 00:41.001
Where something
extraordinary can happen.

00:43.591 --> 00:45.265
Where there are no lies.

00:47.664 --> 00:51.174
But in this life
there are so many lies.

00:53.529 --> 00:56.732
The biggest lie we ever buy into

00:57.329 --> 00:59.413
is that we are in control.

01:01.299 --> 01:03.873
I was never in control.

01:04.854 --> 01:06.462
I just thought I was.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.725
Control is an illusion.

was always powerless.

Once I understood that,

01:37.335 --> 01:38.508
there was no way back.

01:40.614 --> 01:43.172
I built my ivory
tower in the sky,

01:43.272 --> 01:45.860
I built it as high as I could.

01:47.897 --> 01:48.897
I had it all.

01:51.314 --> 01:52.315
I was invincible.

01:55.905 --> 01:58.528
But then I was
dragged back down.

Our own demons.

02:54.032 --> 02:55.067
They never went away.

02:57.069 --> 02:58.069
They just sat there.

a piece missing.

20:44.860 --> 20:45.589
- To a great weekend.
[glasses clinking]

20:45.689 --> 20:47.038
- To a great weekend.

20:47.138 --> 20:49.386
[laughing]

20:49.486 --> 20:52.420
- And your mother, she just
doesn't start sometimes.

20:53.662 --> 20:55.699
- [Claudia] Don't listen to him.

20:58.356 --> 21:00.051
- Oh that wine really is lovely.

21:00.151 --> 21:01.501
Can I have some more Claudia?

21:01.601 --> 21:05.333
- Is that a please or?
- It's a definite please.

21:05.433 --> 21:06.161
Wow.

21:06.261 --> 21:09.195
[thunder rumbling]

21:10.127 --> 21:13.855
[house rumbling and shaking]

21:19.861 --> 21:21.794
What the hell was that?

21:23.589 --> 21:24.589
- What is it?

21:26.523 --> 21:27.523
- It's nothing.

21:29.146 --> 21:33.430
Just let me take
a look, it's fine.

21:33.530 --> 21:37.054
[thunder rumbling]

[suspenseful music]

21:49.925 --> 21:52.790
[thunder rumbling]

21:54.033 --> 21:56.104
- Jesus Christ, what is that?

21:58.624 --> 21:59.659
- It's a storm.

22:01.143 --> 22:02.044
[laughs]

22:02.144 --> 22:03.144
- Are you fucking kidding me?

22:04.077 --> 22:05.078
That's an explosion.

22:09.117 --> 22:10.117
What do we do?

22:12.051 --> 22:13.262
- If it were an explosion

22:13.362 --> 22:15.368
we wouldn't be stood
here talking about it,

22:15.468 --> 22:17.301
we'd be dead already.

22:17.401 --> 22:18.401
- Then what is it?

22:19.437 --> 22:21.750
- I told you, it's just
a storm, it'll pass.

22:27.653 --> 22:29.071
Go and see Anna.

22:29.171 --> 22:31.277
Tell her the Russians
are still in Russia.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.338
- It is just a storm, honey.

22:54.438 --> 22:55.438
It'll be gone soon.

22:59.201 --> 23:00.617
Gonna check the weather, okay?

23:23.605 --> 23:26.888
[suspenseful music]

23:26.988 --> 23:28.265
- What is this?

23:35.928 --> 23:37.485
- Daddy!

23:37.585 --> 23:40.280
Daddy, you have to come in!

23:40.380 --> 23:43.111
- It's just a storm,
honey, go inside.

23:43.211 --> 23:45.562
- You have to come
in, it's Mummy.

23:45.662 --> 23:50.080
Something's wrong with her,
she's in the dining room.

23:57.674 --> 23:59.058
[sobbing]

23:59.158 --> 24:00.128
- What's wrong?

24:00.228 --> 24:02.544
[intense music]

24:02.644 --> 24:04.957
[screaming]

24:07.407 --> 24:08.654
Hey, tell me, what's--

24:08.754 --> 24:10.172
[sobs]

24:10.272 --> 24:11.001
What is it?

24:11.101 --> 24:12.101
Hey, shh.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.103
What?

24:15.139 --> 24:18.180
- We just have to
get through this.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.009
- Get through what, darling?

24:19.109 --> 24:19.941
- Whatever happens.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.943
- Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.600
Just shh, shh, shh.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.218
- I don't know what comes next.

24:26.634 --> 24:28.221
I don't know what happens to us!

24:30.223 --> 24:33.264
- I don't know what you're
talking about, come on, hey.

24:33.364 --> 24:34.364
Hey.

24:35.194 --> 24:37.061
- No!
- Come on.

24:37.161 --> 24:40.061
- We can't just keep pretending
that this isn't happening!

24:43.064 --> 24:45.307
- Shh, it's okay.

24:46.723 --> 24:47.723
- I'm fine.

24:51.900 --> 24:52.629
I'm fine.

24:52.729 --> 24:54.320
I'm fine.

24:54.420 --> 24:57.285
Just give me a minute.

25:00.391 --> 25:01.391
- Mummy.

25:10.194 --> 25:12.338
- It's alright, eh.

25:12.438 --> 25:13.511
Come Anna.

25:13.611 --> 25:14.611
It's okay darling.

25:15.683 --> 25:17.205
It's alright.

25:17.305 --> 25:22.037
Mummy's just had a bad day.

25:22.137 --> 25:23.137
- I made her cry.

25:25.658 --> 25:26.386
- What?

25:26.486 --> 25:27.318
What do you mean?

25:27.418 --> 25:29.148
Why did you make her cry?

25:29.248 --> 25:30.698
- You know why, Daddy.

25:34.632 --> 25:39.054
- I love you.

25:39.154 --> 25:42.261
[light bulb fizzles]

25:43.365 --> 25:44.365
Let's get a torch.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.821
Should we get a torch?

25:46.921 --> 25:49.237
Come on, let's get a torch.

25:49.337 --> 25:51.822
[eerie music]

26:07.010 --> 26:08.010
Those are all fine.

26:10.358 --> 26:13.261
Let's find Mum.

26:13.361 --> 26:16.295
[thunder rumbling]

26:26.581 --> 26:27.893
Are you alright?

26:32.483 --> 26:36.487
What did you mean before, you
don't know what comes next?

26:38.282 --> 26:39.490
- You know what I meant.

26:42.804 --> 26:46.984
What's wrong with you?

26:47.084 --> 26:48.879
You know exactly what I meant.

27:00.235 --> 27:03.135
[thunder rumbling]

27:05.827 --> 27:08.485
[door creaking]

27:11.350 --> 27:12.903
- Anna, close the door.

27:20.359 --> 27:21.359
Anna.

27:37.721 --> 27:38.721
Everything's died.

28:04.921 --> 28:06.754
You go through to the
lounge, wait there.

28:06.854 --> 28:08.203
We'll be through in a minute.

28:08.303 --> 28:09.857
- I don't want to.
- Just go.

28:14.206 --> 28:15.207
I have to call someone.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.351
Oh shit.

28:23.077 --> 28:23.840
Have you got your phone?

28:23.940 --> 28:25.289
- It's in the kitchen.

28:25.389 --> 28:26.739
Who are you calling?

28:26.839 --> 28:29.328
- I don't know,
the fucking police?

28:29.428 --> 28:31.119
You go through and
see she's okay.

28:54.039 --> 28:56.113
[phone ringing]

28:56.213 --> 28:58.733
[eerie music]

29:00.769 --> 29:01.670
Hello?

29:01.770 --> 29:04.121
Hello?
[static buzzing]

29:04.221 --> 29:06.572
- [Man] You know
what this is about.

29:06.672 --> 29:07.672
- I'm sorry?

29:09.502 --> 29:11.888
- [Man] There isn't
long left now.

29:11.988 --> 29:13.265
Only a short time to go.

29:15.474 --> 29:17.855
You know where you are
and what you have to do.

29:18.995 --> 29:21.483
You have to listen to me.

29:21.583 --> 29:25.591
You have to listen to her.

29:25.691 --> 29:26.691
- Hello?

29:30.661 --> 29:31.493
Hello?

29:31.593 --> 29:36.326
Fuck.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.426
Anna.

29:38.531 --> 29:42.435
Oh for fuck's sake.

29:42.535 --> 29:44.675
Anna, Anna.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.269
Anna.

29:48.369 --> 29:51.306
[suspenseful music]

29:51.406 --> 29:52.614
You have to come inside.

29:55.238 --> 29:56.791
- Something's out there, Daddy.

29:59.069 --> 30:00.381
Under those clouds.

30:04.454 --> 30:05.869
I know you can't see it yet.

30:07.629 --> 30:08.630
It's not your fault.

30:10.667 --> 30:12.186
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:14.326 --> 30:18.019
- It's out there.

30:19.089 --> 30:20.089
It won't go.

30:23.335 --> 30:25.306
[shivers]

30:25.406 --> 30:26.407
I'm so cold.

30:27.615 --> 30:29.272
- Come on darling,
let's go, please.

30:31.619 --> 30:33.828
I said let's go back
inside the house.

30:35.864 --> 30:37.073
Anna, go, now!

30:38.005 --> 30:39.005
Now!

30:40.076 --> 30:41.076
Go.

30:47.255 --> 30:48.255
What have they done?

31:00.165 --> 31:01.963
We need to stay inside.

31:02.063 --> 31:03.896
Are all the doors
and windows closed?

31:03.996 --> 31:04.996
- Yeah.

31:07.896 --> 31:09.829
- I think there's
something in the air.

31:14.248 --> 31:16.598
Should we brighten
this place up a bit?

31:16.698 --> 31:18.807
Should we light some candles?

31:18.907 --> 31:20.395
Yeah.

31:20.495 --> 31:21.495
Come on then.

31:22.635 --> 31:23.912
- I'll be in the kitchen.

31:25.190 --> 31:26.191
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:30.402 --> 31:33.857
[lighter clicking]

31:33.957 --> 31:35.786
- [Anna] She knows
why the tree died.

31:39.790 --> 31:40.790
- What do you mean?

31:41.930 --> 31:43.518
- Can't you see
what's happening?

31:46.314 --> 31:47.314
Out there?

31:48.454 --> 31:50.077
- It's just a storm, darling.

32:05.471 --> 32:07.546
Ice cream, what a good idea.

32:07.646 --> 32:09.513
- Of course, want some?

32:09.613 --> 32:10.342
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

32:10.442 --> 32:11.895
- Not you.

32:11.995 --> 32:13.721
I'm just gonna talk
to Dad for a minute.

32:16.931 --> 32:18.243
What did the police say?

32:19.416 --> 32:21.453
- The phones are down,
I couldn't get through.

32:22.902 --> 32:25.046
There's no internet,
there's nothing.

32:25.146 --> 32:26.768
- I heard you
talking to someone.

32:28.391 --> 32:29.292
- No.

32:29.392 --> 32:30.392
That was nothing.

32:32.153 --> 32:33.503
- Then we have to
try and get help.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.332
- We can't go out there yet.

32:35.432 --> 32:36.432
You've seen it.

32:37.572 --> 32:39.402
I think something's
poisoned the air.

32:41.162 --> 32:42.167
We have to wait.

32:42.267 --> 32:43.202
- Wait for what?

32:43.302 --> 32:44.648
It'll get into the house.

32:49.274 --> 32:50.482
- You alright sweetheart?

32:51.655 --> 32:52.655
- I'm cold.

32:55.349 --> 32:57.320
- Well then the
ice cream probably

32:57.420 --> 32:58.938
wasn't a good idea then, was it?

33:00.112 --> 33:01.769
Shall I get you
a warmer sweater?

33:04.116 --> 33:06.291
- Where is Mummy?
- I'm here, sweetheart.

33:11.710 --> 33:12.710
Is that good?

33:14.747 --> 33:16.649
- I'm cold though.

33:16.749 --> 33:17.754
- Ah.

33:17.854 --> 33:19.373
- I'll go and get her a sweater.

33:20.926 --> 33:23.273
- [Anna] You were never
there when I needed you.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.520
- What?

33:30.901 --> 33:31.901
What did you say?

33:35.389 --> 33:37.394
- I didn't say anything.

33:37.494 --> 33:38.494
- She didn't speak.

33:48.919 --> 33:49.855
- [Anna] Daddy, it hurts!

33:49.955 --> 33:52.444
[intense music]
- Anna?

33:52.544 --> 33:54.170
- [Anna] Daddy I need you here!

33:54.270 --> 33:56.172
- Anna!

33:56.272 --> 33:57.276
Anna!

33:57.376 --> 33:58.860
- [Anna] Daddy, it hurts!

34:01.035 --> 34:01.936
- What?

34:02.036 --> 34:03.213
Why are you shouting?

34:03.313 --> 34:04.313
She's here.

34:05.488 --> 34:06.903
- I just heard her up there.

34:08.629 --> 34:11.014
[intense music]

34:11.114 --> 34:12.049
- Daddy.

34:12.149 --> 34:13.703
- No--
- It hurts so much.

34:17.672 --> 34:18.672
What's wrong, Daddy?

34:22.815 --> 34:27.203
- Alex, what is it?

34:27.303 --> 34:28.580
- I'm sorry.

34:33.757 --> 34:34.757
I'm not feeling well.

34:35.449 --> 34:36.657
- That's how it started.

34:38.279 --> 34:39.279
- What?

34:41.524 --> 34:42.908
How what started?

34:43.007 --> 34:45.496
- I love you.

34:45.597 --> 34:47.875
I always will.

35:12.624 --> 35:15.872
- Mummy?
[suspenseful music]

35:15.972 --> 35:18.285
[screaming]

35:20.356 --> 35:22.565
[shouting]

35:25.982 --> 35:27.328
What's Mummy doing now?

35:30.227 --> 35:32.368
[sobbing]

35:33.369 --> 35:36.786
- You stay in here, do not move.

35:52.319 --> 35:55.222
Claudia, what the
hell are you doing?

35:55.322 --> 35:56.844
- The fucking tree!

35:56.944 --> 35:59.295
That's why all
this is happening.

35:59.395 --> 36:00.572
I don't want this

36:00.672 --> 36:03.951
fucking piece of shit
in my garden anymore!

36:05.401 --> 36:06.129
Ah!

36:06.229 --> 36:07.334
- Stop, stop!

36:08.300 --> 36:09.132
Stop!

36:09.232 --> 36:11.479
- It was supposed to protect us!

36:11.579 --> 36:13.136
- Stop!
[screaming]

36:13.236 --> 36:14.724
Stop!

36:14.824 --> 36:17.554
I didn't come back here
to see you like this!

36:17.654 --> 36:18.654
- Come back?

36:21.969 --> 36:23.077
What do you mean?

36:23.177 --> 36:24.454
- I don't know what
I fucking mean!

36:25.869 --> 36:28.565
We can't be out here,
we have to be inside!

36:28.665 --> 36:30.222
Anna's there!

36:30.322 --> 36:31.875
- She's not in the house!

36:33.152 --> 36:34.502
- What?

36:34.602 --> 36:37.156
- Did you not hear what they
said to us in that room?

36:38.330 --> 36:42.023
Did you not hear
what has to happen?

36:44.923 --> 36:48.344
- I don't know what the
fuck you are talking about!

36:48.444 --> 36:49.586
What room?

36:49.686 --> 36:51.174
What fucking room?

36:51.274 --> 36:53.310
- You can't pretend
this isn't happening.

36:54.553 --> 36:55.834
You have to face it.

36:55.934 --> 36:57.629
[thunder rumbling]

36:57.729 --> 36:59.765
[crying]

37:15.402 --> 37:16.472
- Anna, Anna?

37:24.928 --> 37:27.275
[cork pops]

37:50.264 --> 37:51.545
I need to look for Anna.

37:51.645 --> 37:54.924
- She's not here
you fucking idiot!

37:57.513 --> 37:59.342
If you won't go with
me, that's fine.

38:00.619 --> 38:01.619
But I have to go.

38:03.519 --> 38:05.282
- Go with you where?

38:05.382 --> 38:06.767
I don't know what you mean!

38:06.867 --> 38:10.564
- For fuck's sake, Alex!
- What's happening to you?

38:10.664 --> 38:12.669
You can't go out there!

38:12.769 --> 38:13.769
I've told you!

38:18.913 --> 38:20.294
- There's nothing I can do.

38:21.709 --> 38:23.193
But I still have to be there.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.645
[tense music]

38:41.246 --> 38:43.559
[car beeps]

39:01.369 --> 39:03.237
- [Alex] Where are you going?

39:03.337 --> 39:06.309
- I can't look after
both of you right now.

39:06.409 --> 39:07.583
I can't do this anymore.

39:09.274 --> 39:10.274
I have to be there.

39:12.311 --> 39:13.520
- We've done this before.

39:14.762 --> 39:16.281
You've said this to me before.

39:17.282 --> 39:18.283
Where are you going?

39:46.276 --> 39:48.696
I didn't come back here
to see you like this!

39:48.796 --> 39:50.560
- [Claudia] Come back,
what do you mean?

39:50.660 --> 39:52.766
- [Alex] I don't know
what I fucking mean!

40:08.436 --> 40:09.576
- Why did she leave us?

40:12.164 --> 40:14.028
- She's gone to get
help, I told you.

40:14.891 --> 40:16.931
- Why didn't we go with her?

40:17.031 --> 40:19.033
- Because it's better
that we stay here.

40:22.865 --> 40:23.865
- Why?

40:27.352 --> 40:30.010
[intense music]

40:34.773 --> 40:35.773
- Anna.

40:37.707 --> 40:38.777
Come and hold my hand.

40:39.813 --> 40:42.229
- Why?
- Just do it, now.

40:49.892 --> 40:50.620
[screaming]

40:50.720 --> 40:55.691
- It's him!

40:57.658 --> 40:59.039
- Wait here, hold that.

40:59.971 --> 41:01.351
- Don't go near him, Daddy!

41:05.217 --> 41:06.217
Daddy!

41:07.461 --> 41:10.395
[thunder rumbling]

41:12.397 --> 41:14.054
- Not here, come on.

41:15.400 --> 41:19.131
Down into the cellar.
- I hate it down there!

41:19.231 --> 41:21.406
- [Alex] Quickly, quickly.

41:22.407 --> 41:23.515
- I don't wanna go down there.

41:23.615 --> 41:25.928
- [Alex] Please go down
quick, do as I say.

41:37.318 --> 41:38.595
- I'm freezing.

41:39.631 --> 41:40.770
- You're gonna be fine.

41:49.606 --> 41:51.405
- He's gonna come
down here, Daddy.

41:51.505 --> 41:54.684
- No, we're safe here.

41:54.784 --> 41:57.166
[whimpering]

41:58.788 --> 41:59.788
It's okay.

42:00.825 --> 42:02.865
It's okay, darling.

42:02.965 --> 42:06.316
[banging]
[intense music]

42:06.416 --> 42:07.935
- The ax won't hurt him, Daddy.

42:18.049 --> 42:19.291
- I know what this is.

42:24.020 --> 42:24.956
Look at me.

42:25.056 --> 42:27.993
- Dad.
- Look at me.

42:28.093 --> 42:29.093
Look at me.

42:29.785 --> 42:31.479
Concentrate, keep looking at me.

42:31.579 --> 42:34.206
We can make this go away,
we can make this go away.

42:34.306 --> 42:36.036
We can make him go away.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.658
If you just keep looking at me.

42:37.758 --> 42:38.897
Look at me, look at me.

42:40.209 --> 42:42.387
We can make this
go away, we can.

42:42.487 --> 42:44.006
Just keep looking at me.

42:45.593 --> 42:46.593
You see?

42:47.803 --> 42:48.803
Okay?

42:56.432 --> 42:57.432
- He's gone.

42:58.606 --> 43:00.474
But he's going to come back.

43:00.574 --> 43:02.718
- No he's not.

43:02.818 --> 43:03.788
I promise.

43:03.888 --> 43:07.067
Let me have a look, okay?

43:07.167 --> 43:12.172
Okay?
- Okay.

43:30.086 --> 43:31.086
- Anna.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.400
Anna?

43:36.334 --> 43:37.338
Anna?

43:37.438 --> 43:39.924
It's okay darling, he's gone.

43:41.753 --> 43:42.753
Anna?

43:44.376 --> 43:45.726
Anna!

43:45.826 --> 43:48.484
[intense music]

43:49.416 --> 43:50.317
Anna!

43:50.417 --> 43:52.043
Anna!

43:52.143 --> 43:53.143
Anna!

43:57.217 --> 43:58.252
Sweetheart, Anna?

43:59.495 --> 44:00.495
Sweetheart?

44:09.022 --> 44:10.022
Anna?

44:21.379 --> 44:22.379
That's beautiful.

44:26.522 --> 44:27.522
Who's that?

44:28.869 --> 44:29.869
- A stranger.

44:31.907 --> 44:33.498
- [Alex] What stranger?

44:33.598 --> 44:35.569
[suspenseful music]

44:35.669 --> 44:39.815
- I don't know, but
I don't like him.

44:39.915 --> 44:42.438
- Then why did you draw him?

44:42.538 --> 44:44.371
- [Anna] I'm drawing
it how it is.

44:44.471 --> 44:47.512
The clouds come
first, then he comes.

44:47.612 --> 44:49.479
- What does he want?

44:49.579 --> 44:52.448
- You know what he wants.

44:52.548 --> 44:57.553
You know what he wants.

45:59.580 --> 46:03.381
Daddy!

46:03.481 --> 46:08.486
Daddy!

46:12.386 --> 46:15.044
[door creaking]

46:45.005 --> 46:48.736
[intense music]
- Anna?

46:48.836 --> 46:49.836
Anna?

46:50.666 --> 46:51.666
Anna!

46:54.014 --> 46:55.014
Anna!

46:55.740 --> 46:56.740
Baby.

46:59.088 --> 47:00.088
Are you okay?

47:00.814 --> 47:01.814
Can you speak?

47:02.954 --> 47:04.335
- It hurts so much.

47:05.439 --> 47:07.269
- What hurts,
darling, what is it?

47:09.236 --> 47:10.236
- My tummy.

47:10.927 --> 47:11.927
- Your tummy?

47:13.413 --> 47:14.521
Can...

47:14.621 --> 47:16.450
Well let's get you
out of here, shall we?

47:17.555 --> 47:19.039
Come on darling, can you move?

47:20.316 --> 47:22.356
Come on darling, here we go.

47:22.456 --> 47:24.462
Put your arms 'round
me, there you go.

47:24.562 --> 47:25.632
Come on, up you go.

47:27.703 --> 47:30.399
Okay.

47:30.499 --> 47:32.953
- [Anna] I heard a
voice whispering.

47:33.053 --> 47:34.368
- You did?

47:34.468 --> 47:37.782
- [Anna] He told me I
didn't belong here anymore.

47:40.095 --> 47:44.616
He didn't take me, he
just, just left me.

47:45.859 --> 47:47.002
[thunder rumbling]

47:47.102 --> 47:48.620
- Well that's because
you belong with me.

47:51.071 --> 47:53.970
And I'll never, ever let you go.

47:55.248 --> 47:56.248
Okay?

47:57.836 --> 47:59.873
[crying]

48:01.668 --> 48:03.984
Come on, that's it, you're okay.

48:04.084 --> 48:05.158
You're okay darling.

48:05.258 --> 48:06.849
Just lie there a second.

48:06.949 --> 48:08.057
Okay?

48:08.157 --> 48:09.300
That's it.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.716
Just stay there for a
second, you're okay.

48:11.816 --> 48:12.817
Okay darling.

48:13.749 --> 48:16.407
[phone ringing]

48:23.655 --> 48:24.556
Hello?

48:24.656 --> 48:25.902
- [Claudia] Alex.

48:26.002 --> 48:27.728
- Hello?
- Alex.

48:28.971 --> 48:30.076
- Claudia?
- Yeah.

48:31.905 --> 48:36.706
I'm here, I just saw
her, she's sleeping.

48:36.806 --> 48:37.984
- Who?

48:38.084 --> 48:39.882
- [Claudia] Anna,
who do you think?

48:39.982 --> 48:41.090
- Well Anna's here with me!

48:41.190 --> 48:42.574
- [Claudia] What are
you talking about?

48:42.674 --> 48:43.674
- She's sick!

48:44.711 --> 48:46.130
I have to get her out of here!

48:46.230 --> 48:47.230
We can't stay here.

48:51.994 --> 48:53.068
Come on.

48:53.168 --> 48:54.552
Come on baby.

48:54.652 --> 48:58.832
That's it, up you go, come
on, that's it, let's go.

48:58.932 --> 49:00.834
[thunder rumbling]
[suspenseful music]

49:00.934 --> 49:03.354
Alright darling, you'll be fine.

49:03.454 --> 49:05.045
Let's get you in here.

49:05.145 --> 49:06.736
Okay darling.

49:06.836 --> 49:08.359
You're gonna be fine.

49:08.459 --> 49:10.119
You're gonna be fine, okay?

49:10.219 --> 49:15.224
There you go.

49:18.124 --> 49:20.954
[engine rumbling]

49:29.997 --> 49:32.759
[haunting music]

49:59.095 --> 50:00.095
What is this?

50:04.549 --> 50:05.549
The road.

50:08.070 --> 50:09.175
There's only one road.

50:11.798 --> 50:13.455
All the other roads have gone.

50:39.170 --> 50:41.590
- You need to go back
to the house, Daddy.

50:41.690 --> 50:42.898
- We can't go back there.

50:46.695 --> 50:47.695
- Not me.

50:48.973 --> 50:49.973
You.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.320
You need to go back.

50:56.049 --> 50:58.948
[suspenseful music]

51:19.521 --> 51:21.971
Not we, you.

51:25.492 --> 51:28.426
[thunder rumbling]

52:29.245 --> 52:32.252
- Come on darling, it's okay.

52:32.352 --> 52:34.354
Come on sweetheart.

52:43.605 --> 52:45.503
- [Anna] What is
this place, Daddy?

52:46.401 --> 52:48.268
- I don't know, sweetheart,

52:48.368 --> 52:50.995
but we have to find some help.

52:51.095 --> 52:52.095
Hello?

52:53.200 --> 52:54.792
Is there anyone there?

52:54.892 --> 52:56.134
Can someone help me?

52:57.204 --> 52:58.204
Hello?

53:06.144 --> 53:07.145
Here we are.

53:08.561 --> 53:09.669
There you go.

53:09.769 --> 53:11.774
It's alright, sweetheart.

53:11.874 --> 53:12.874
Just sleep.

53:15.222 --> 53:18.778
[footsteps tapping softly]

53:27.131 --> 53:28.339
Excuse me, sorry.

53:35.760 --> 53:36.760
Hello?

53:37.624 --> 53:39.077
- Yes sir, how can I help you?

53:39.177 --> 53:41.632
- Is this a hospital?

53:41.732 --> 53:42.805
- Of course, sir.

53:42.905 --> 53:43.737
How can I help?

53:43.837 --> 53:45.360
- My daughter, she's sick.

53:45.460 --> 53:47.983
- Yes sir, she's
with the doctors now.

53:48.083 --> 53:49.916
- No I'm sorry, I don't
think you understand,

53:50.016 --> 53:51.435
we've just come in.

53:51.535 --> 53:53.502
My daughter is here,
we need your help.

53:54.572 --> 53:55.572
Please, listen.

54:02.235 --> 54:03.235
Anna?

54:04.099 --> 54:05.311
My daughter was just there.

54:05.411 --> 54:06.446
Where is my daughter?

54:07.827 --> 54:09.207
Where has my daughter gone?

54:11.037 --> 54:12.870
- The doctors are
with her now, sir.

54:12.970 --> 54:14.872
Just take a seat and the
doctors will be along

54:14.972 --> 54:15.973
to talk to you soon.

54:17.146 --> 54:20.533
- I said where have
they taken her?

54:20.633 --> 54:22.638
- She'll have gone to
the sixth floor, sir.

54:22.738 --> 54:24.913
I'm sure the doctors
will talk to you soon.

54:25.845 --> 54:28.848
[suspenseful music]

54:57.566 --> 54:59.019
[intense music]

54:59.119 --> 55:00.642
[shouting]

55:00.742 --> 55:02.364
- Get the fuck off!

55:08.404 --> 55:09.404
Anna!

55:10.337 --> 55:12.205
Anna, where are you?

55:12.305 --> 55:13.305
Get down!

55:15.895 --> 55:17.590
- Alex, keep calm.

55:17.690 --> 55:18.694
It'll all be over soon.

55:18.794 --> 55:22.526
- No!

55:22.626 --> 55:24.148
- [Anna] Daddy!

55:24.248 --> 55:26.806
Get them off me!

55:26.906 --> 55:29.291
Stop them, Daddy!

55:29.391 --> 55:32.190
They're hurting me!

55:32.290 --> 55:34.814
Daddy, Daddy!

55:34.914 --> 55:38.089
[breathing shallowly]

56:05.738 --> 56:07.981
[clanking]

56:11.640 --> 56:13.918
[grunting]

56:19.337 --> 56:21.995
[intense music]

56:23.479 --> 56:25.240
- Get me out of this!

56:26.413 --> 56:28.692
Get me fucking out of this!

56:37.459 --> 56:38.459
Claudia?

56:40.704 --> 56:41.704
Claudia?

56:43.983 --> 56:44.983
Claudia?

56:47.918 --> 56:48.918
Is that you?

56:50.921 --> 56:52.339
Claudia.

56:52.439 --> 56:55.822
Claudia, for god's sake,
come, get me out of this.

57:03.036 --> 57:04.036
Claudia.

57:06.315 --> 57:07.869
- You have to let them do this.

57:09.215 --> 57:10.803
We can't save her, but they can.

57:12.321 --> 57:13.357
- Have you seen them?

57:15.255 --> 57:17.464
Do you know what they're
going to do to her?

57:18.673 --> 57:21.610
For god's sake, help
me, get me out of this.

57:21.710 --> 57:22.710
- I can't do that.

57:24.126 --> 57:25.994
They need you to stay calm.

57:26.094 --> 57:27.616
There's nothing we can do.

57:27.716 --> 57:29.515
- For fuck's sake!

57:29.615 --> 57:30.926
- She's been here for days.

57:34.861 --> 57:36.242
We've been waiting for you.

57:38.624 --> 57:39.625
They're with her now.

57:40.936 --> 57:42.317
There's nothing you can do.

57:45.182 --> 57:49.638
- If you can just
get me out of this,

57:49.738 --> 57:52.396
they're hurting me.

57:54.260 --> 57:58.785
And I will sit with
you and we will wait

57:58.885 --> 58:03.027
for the doctors to
come so we can see her.

58:10.690 --> 58:13.348
- [Claudia] You have to be calm.

58:15.039 --> 58:16.039
- I promise.

58:18.249 --> 58:19.941
Not like the last time.

58:46.277 --> 58:47.900
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

58:49.142 --> 58:50.043
We have to find her,

58:50.143 --> 58:51.320
we have to get her out of here,

58:51.420 --> 58:52.559
we have to get her out!

58:53.491 --> 58:55.079
- She's not really here anymore.

58:56.425 --> 58:57.775
You know that.

58:57.875 --> 59:01.330
- She is here and
I have to find her.

59:01.430 --> 59:02.500
I brought her here!

59:05.711 --> 59:07.920
[rumbling]

59:09.231 --> 59:11.889
[intense music]

59:21.036 --> 59:23.076
Claudia, come to me.

59:23.176 --> 59:24.176
Claudia.

59:32.289 --> 59:33.531
Come to me now.

59:37.397 --> 59:39.814
[gun firing]

59:41.160 --> 59:42.924
You're not gonna take her, you!

59:43.024 --> 59:45.374
You're not gonna
fucking take her!

59:45.474 --> 59:47.891
[gun firing]

59:49.340 --> 59:52.412
[empty gun clicking]

59:56.037 --> 59:57.486
Claudia, Claudia!

59:58.487 --> 59:59.487
Claudia!

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:01.696
Claudia!

01:00:19.508 --> 01:00:21.683
[banging]

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:32.970
- [Anna] Daddy!

01:00:34.144 --> 01:00:36.322
They're hurting me.

01:00:36.422 --> 01:00:38.217
Please don't let them.

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:42.462
[groaning]

01:01:03.967 --> 01:01:04.967
- Can you help me?

01:01:07.902 --> 01:01:09.179
They just left me in here.

01:01:14.149 --> 01:01:16.327
I don't know if I'm thirsty

01:01:16.427 --> 01:01:19.016
but I haven't had anything
to drink for days.

01:01:21.398 --> 01:01:22.778
They just left me in here.

01:01:25.712 --> 01:01:27.404
There's a jug of
water over there.

01:01:30.752 --> 01:01:32.896
Ask one of the nurses to come.

01:01:32.996 --> 01:01:34.998
They haven't been
in here for weeks.

01:01:38.346 --> 01:01:41.176
Why would they just
leave me here like this?

01:01:44.766 --> 01:01:46.599
I can't feel my legs.

01:01:46.699 --> 01:01:47.769
Something's not right.

01:01:54.603 --> 01:01:57.848
I don't think you're
allowed to do that.

01:02:02.611 --> 01:02:03.889
Look what they did to me.

01:02:06.788 --> 01:02:08.548
That's what they do.

01:02:13.968 --> 01:02:16.180
That's what they're
going to do with her.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280
- Who?

01:02:19.594 --> 01:02:20.594
- Anna.

01:02:21.976 --> 01:02:24.081
This is what they're
going to do with her.

01:02:24.979 --> 01:02:25.979
Your little girl.

01:02:28.948 --> 01:02:30.674
- You have to tell
me where she is.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.370
[laughing]

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:35.579
- You can't stop it.

01:02:35.679 --> 01:02:36.891
[intense music]

01:02:36.991 --> 01:02:38.582
You can't get her back now.

01:02:38.682 --> 01:02:43.687
Nothing you can do!

01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:58.150
[crying]

01:03:21.276 --> 01:03:23.865

[suspenseful music]

01:04:03.077 --> 01:04:04.077
- Anna!

01:04:08.082 --> 01:04:09.082
Anna!

01:05:52.427 --> 01:05:54.878
I can't find you, sweetheart.

01:06:11.929 --> 01:06:14.932
[suspenseful music]

01:07:13.267 --> 01:07:14.475
Don't take her.

01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:17.270
Take me.

01:07:52.996 --> 01:07:55.481
[eerie music]

01:08:08.943 --> 01:08:10.255
- [Doctor] Alex?

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.224
Alex, can you hear me?

01:08:16.053 --> 01:08:17.296
- My arms hurt.

01:08:18.884 --> 01:08:21.886
- Alex, I need you
to come this way.

01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:29.066
Just keep moving towards me.

01:08:30.551 --> 01:08:31.551
Good.

01:08:36.073 --> 01:08:37.453
Just keep coming.

01:08:39.353 --> 01:08:40.353
Think of Anna.

01:08:41.872 --> 01:08:43.390
And just keep coming.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.020
Take my hand.

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:15.423
[breathing shallowly]

01:09:31.921 --> 01:09:33.578
How are you feeling?

01:09:36.341 --> 01:09:37.341
- I don't know.

01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:44.071
Where am I?

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:47.729
- Can you stand?

01:10:20.246 --> 01:10:21.246
- Anna.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.180
Where is she?

01:10:27.668 --> 01:10:29.877
My wife, Claudia?

01:10:33.156 --> 01:10:34.640
- Anna was on the ward here.

01:10:36.401 --> 01:10:37.401
- Was?

01:10:39.921 --> 01:10:40.921
Where is she?

01:10:42.545 --> 01:10:44.309
What are you doing to her?

01:10:44.409 --> 01:10:45.409
- Sit down.

01:10:49.690 --> 01:10:52.037
Your daughter passed away, Alex.

01:10:54.039 --> 01:10:56.697
You were there with her,
both you and your wife.

01:10:57.491 --> 01:10:58.288
[haunting music]

01:10:58.388 --> 01:10:59.424
Do you remember that?

01:11:04.118 --> 01:11:07.811
- But she was just here with me.

01:11:09.019 --> 01:11:10.055
She was just here.

01:11:18.408 --> 01:11:21.173
Where's my wife, Claudia?

01:11:21.273 --> 01:11:22.657
- She's waiting for you at home.

01:11:22.757 --> 01:11:23.757
- No!

01:11:26.278 --> 01:11:28.245
She was here in the
corridor waiting.

01:11:29.108 --> 01:11:30.631
Why would she be home?

01:11:30.731 --> 01:11:34.324
- She's cooking
dinner at home, Alex.

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:37.738
She never left the house.

01:11:38.911 --> 01:11:40.813
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:11:40.913 --> 01:11:43.916
- Your daughter died
of cancer, Alex.

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:46.090
You know that.

01:11:48.093 --> 01:11:49.512
There was nothing more
we could do for her,

01:11:49.612 --> 01:11:54.202
she died three months ago,
here, in this hospital.

01:11:58.413 --> 01:12:00.315
- But she was just with me.

01:12:00.415 --> 01:12:02.766
[voice breaking]

01:12:02.866 --> 01:12:03.871
[crying]

01:12:03.971 --> 01:12:04.971
I brought her here.

01:12:07.319 --> 01:12:08.596
- [Doctor] I'm very sorry.

01:12:24.888 --> 01:12:25.888
- I know.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:29.514
I know she's gone.

01:12:33.276 --> 01:12:34.760
But she was just here.

01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:44.187
- You can still speak to her.

01:12:44.287 --> 01:12:45.287
Anna.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.947
She's in there, waiting for you.

01:12:53.607 --> 01:12:54.746
But you have to go now.

01:12:57.611 --> 01:12:58.888
Before it's too late.

01:13:00.061 --> 01:13:01.722
There's very little time.

01:13:01.822 --> 01:13:03.133
- I told you she was here.

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:06.515
I told you.

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:27.986
[suspenseful music]

01:14:25.284 --> 01:14:27.773
- It's alright, Daddy.

01:14:27.873 --> 01:14:28.873
It's okay.

01:14:34.777 --> 01:14:36.019
- I'm so sorry.

01:14:38.573 --> 01:14:39.989
- It's not your fault, Daddy.

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:47.341
Everyone's been so kind to me.

01:14:48.722 --> 01:14:53.278
The doctors looked after me.

01:14:54.141 --> 01:14:55.487
- I'm sorry I wasn't there.

01:14:58.973 --> 01:15:02.463
- You were there.

01:15:02.563 --> 01:15:03.909
It's not your fault, Daddy.

01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:08.258
You didn't make me sick,

01:15:09.363 --> 01:15:10.471
you couldn't do
anything to stop this.

01:15:10.571 --> 01:15:13.060
- I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.782
- We both know
you can't do that.

01:15:17.302 --> 01:15:18.683
You think you are a bad dad,

01:15:20.477 --> 01:15:21.477
that's why all
this is happening,

01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:25.003
that's why you're seeing
all these strange things.

01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:26.103
But you weren't.

01:15:28.554 --> 01:15:30.522
And you know why you
weren't a bad dad?

01:15:33.767 --> 01:15:36.770
'Cause every day I
knew that you loved me.

01:15:44.916 --> 01:15:46.676
- I love you so much.

01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:49.298
- I know.

01:15:51.612 --> 01:15:52.993
And I always did.

01:15:55.789 --> 01:15:57.273
And I love you too.

01:15:59.551 --> 01:16:01.795

them take you away.

[eerie music]

01:16:04.142 --> 01:16:08.802
- Daddy, I need you
to listen to me.

01:16:09.803 --> 01:16:10.873
There isn't much time.

01:16:13.082 --> 01:16:14.704
He's not here for me, Daddy.

01:16:16.844 --> 01:16:19.847
He's here for you.

01:16:21.849 --> 01:16:23.026
- What?

01:16:23.126 --> 01:16:26.474
- It's not me that's in
danger, Daddy, it's you.

01:16:27.648 --> 01:16:29.719
- I don't understand, baby.

01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:32.860

our favorite place?

01:16:34.068 --> 01:16:36.795
[haunting music]

01:17:02.683 --> 01:17:06.345
You need to go back to our
summer house, down by the lake.

01:17:06.445 --> 01:17:09.176
- I can't leave
you here like this.

01:17:09.276 --> 01:17:11.278
- Yes, you can.

01:17:12.797 --> 01:17:14.250
And you have to.

01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:15.627
I have to do this.

01:17:18.457 --> 01:17:19.457
- Anna.

01:17:20.632 --> 01:17:21.632
Anna.

01:17:26.017 --> 01:17:27.432
- He can't hurt me, Daddy.

01:17:29.227 --> 01:17:30.366
But he can hurt you.

01:17:32.471 --> 01:17:33.471
He's here for you.

01:17:34.577 --> 01:17:35.858
You need to go back
to the summer house

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:37.894
where you hurt yourself.

01:17:37.994 --> 01:17:39.030
- I don't understand.

01:17:40.514 --> 01:17:42.757
- Remember what happened
at the summer house.

All the things you've seen

01:18:32.946 --> 01:18:35.120
have happened in the few moments
since you hurt your arms.

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:41.125
It's close now.

01:18:42.748 --> 01:18:43.853
You haven't got long.

01:18:52.827 --> 01:18:54.243
You have to let me go, Daddy.

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:56.901
You have to let me go.

01:18:58.109 --> 01:18:59.109
- No.

01:19:01.181 --> 01:19:02.181
- Go back.

I love you.

You didn't make me sick.

Daddy, but he can hurt you.

- Claudia.
