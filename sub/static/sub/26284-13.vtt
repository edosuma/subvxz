00:02.169 --> 00:03.838
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:03.921 --> 00:06.424
- Veronica.
- I'm here for your mom's Bible study.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.758
I'm glad you could join us.

00:07.842 --> 00:10.261
- What are you doing?
- Come here for Bible study.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.655
If you want to be
a good Christian,

00:11.679 --> 00:13.556
maybe you should stop
lying through your teeth.

00:13.639 --> 00:16.851
Hey, Mom, just a heads-up.
I'm gettin' baptized tomorrow.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.439
We did it.
I'm so happy.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.732
I love you.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.322
<i>There are certain phrases</i>

00:30.406 --> 00:32.950
<i>that are used by dads
around the world.</i>

00:44.253 --> 00:46.797
<i>♪ Well, it's all right... ♪</i>

00:48.049 --> 00:49.300
Close the fridge.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.885
You're wastin' money.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.512
I'm having trouble deciding
between pudding and Jell-O.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.849
Well, decide what you want,
and then open it.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.559
But I need the visual input.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.352
Does the pudding have a skin?

01:00.436 --> 01:03.105
Plus, it's good fun
jiggling the Jell-O.

01:03.189 --> 01:05.250
- Do you have any idea what our electric bill is?
- Yes.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.484
I do our taxes.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.110
And it's higher
than it should be.

01:08.194 --> 01:09.862
And why do you think that is?

01:09.945 --> 01:11.530
Well, I don't want
to point any fingers,

01:11.614 --> 01:14.116
but Missy sleeps
with a night-light.

01:14.784 --> 01:17.036
Make a choice
and close the door.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.914
Okay. There's only one
logical way to settle this.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.248
Eenie-meenie...

01:21.332 --> 01:23.209
Close the door!

01:23.292 --> 01:25.836

01:51.987 --> 01:52.988
Hey.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.699
What do you want?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.660
I just wanted to
apologize again.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.370
My behavior was crazy.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.163
I blame hormones.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.207
Really?
'Cause I blame you.

02:03.290 --> 02:06.418
Is there any way
you can forgive me?

02:07.002 --> 02:08.044
Please?

02:11.423 --> 02:13.551
Fine. I forgive you.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.570
You're not just saying it
'cause you're trying to be

02:15.594 --> 02:17.763
a good Christian and
you're afraid of going to Hell?

02:17.847 --> 02:19.473
Do you want me
to forgive you or not?

02:19.557 --> 02:21.100
Very much.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.435
Then stop talking
and let's move on.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.104
So... so we're friends again?

02:26.063 --> 02:27.106
Sure.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.483
Just as friends,
would you wanna hang out

02:29.567 --> 02:30.985
on Saturday night?

02:31.068 --> 02:34.405
In a no-kissing and no-punching-in-
the-face kind of way?

02:34.488 --> 02:36.740
I can't. My boyfriend's
taking me to dinner.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.701
<i>Boyfriend, boyfriend,
boyfriend...</i>

02:38.784 --> 02:40.369
You know,
I got to run.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.621
I'm glad we're friends again.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.338
- Your brother looks upset.
- Really?

02:51.422 --> 02:52.882
I would have guessed hungry.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.675
See you later.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.431
Mr. Givens,
a moment of your time?

03:02.641 --> 03:04.768
I'm curious about
more cost-effective methods

03:04.852 --> 03:06.562
of generating electricity.

03:07.563 --> 03:08.731
And?

03:08.814 --> 03:10.608
And I came to you. Go.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.653
Well, there's fossil fuels,
like oil and coal.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.572
- Too dirty.
- Oh. Hydro?

03:16.655 --> 03:18.157
- Too wet.
- Solar?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.409
With this fair skin? Next.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.328
Wind?

03:22.411 --> 03:25.206
You know what the problem
with wind is.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.707
It's too reliant on wind.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.790
I think I'm looking

03:27.833 --> 03:29.919
for something
a little more indoors.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.420
How about nuclear power?

03:31.503 --> 03:33.714
It's clean and efficient
and very safe,

03:33.797 --> 03:36.008
until something goes
horribly wrong.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.928
That could work.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.930
Oh. Goody.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.097
Are we done?

03:42.181 --> 03:45.517
Almost. I have one last question
about nuclear reactors.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.061
What?

03:47.144 --> 03:49.480
How do I build one? Go.

03:50.564 --> 03:54.151
<i>Spoiler alert: He didn't know.</i>

03:54.235 --> 03:55.861
Hello?

03:55.945 --> 03:58.322
Hello, my little vicuña.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.158
Well, hello to you, too.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.495
And more importantly,
what is a vicuña?

04:04.578 --> 04:09.208
Only what I feel is the cutest
camelid on the planet.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.627
Well, I suppose I could ask you
what a camelid is,

04:11.710 --> 04:14.213
but you're just gonna say
more words that I don't know.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.297
<i>What's up?</i>

04:15.381 --> 04:17.298
There's an upcoming event
at the university,

04:17.382 --> 04:19.802
and I'd like you to be
my plus-one.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.887
Oh. Well, I'd love to go.

04:21.971 --> 04:25.307
- Wonderful! It's a date. Bye.
- Wait, wait.

04:25.391 --> 04:27.535
<i>Hang on there, partner.
I need a little more information.</i>

04:27.559 --> 04:28.686
When is this event?

04:28.769 --> 04:29.979
This Friday night.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.063
Oh. What time?

04:31.146 --> 04:32.356
I'm not sure.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.857
Well, will there be food?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.067
I have no idea.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.568
What's the dress code?

04:36.652 --> 04:37.653
Not a clue.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.363
Well, what do you know?

04:39.446 --> 04:40.948
You're my plus-one.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.493
Well, you go do a little more
research and get back to me.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.704
- You got it!
- Bye.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.289
- Wait.
- What?

04:48.372 --> 04:51.542
- Love you!
- Love you, too.

04:54.545 --> 04:58.340
Hello. Is this the studio that
makes the <i>Professor Proton</i> show?

04:58.424 --> 04:59.717
Excellent.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.011
May I speak to him, please?

05:02.678 --> 05:04.805
Well, then I'd like
to leave him a message.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.890
My name is Sheldon Cooper,
and I'm trying to build

05:06.974 --> 05:10.019
a nuclear reactor,
and I could use his help.

05:10.102 --> 05:14.315
My number is 409-356-6049.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.900
Thank you.
I'm gonna hang up now,

05:16.984 --> 05:18.277
because this is long-distance,

05:18.360 --> 05:20.237
and my father
doesn't make much money.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.488
Good-bye.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.826
Georgie, question:

05:26.535 --> 05:30.080
In the hallway earlier today,
were you upset or hungry?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.249
Shut up.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.004
That's hungry.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.922
<i>Connie, I believe</i>

05:39.006 --> 05:41.008
I have answers
to all your questions.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.384
Lay it on me.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.970
Time: The event begins
at 6:00 p.m.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.973
The dress code
is business attire.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.267
Dinner will be served,
but it's been suggested

05:50.351 --> 05:53.187
that we eat first,
because the food is dreadful.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.563
Good to know.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.981
And last but not least,

05:56.065 --> 05:59.151
a camelid is any member
of the camelidae family,

05:59.234 --> 06:02.154
such as llamas,
alpacas or vicuñas.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.573
You didn't ask that one,

06:04.656 --> 06:07.868
but, uh, it seemed like
something you should know.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.328
John...

06:09.411 --> 06:12.331
is everybody at this party
gonna be a scientist like you?

06:12.414 --> 06:14.291
Not everybody.
You'll be there.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.793
That's kind of
what I'm gettin' at.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.211
Is there a problem?

06:17.294 --> 06:18.796
Well...

06:19.380 --> 06:20.964
yeah.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.175
I didn't go to college.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.260
I was a total screwup
in high school.

06:25.344 --> 06:26.804
I might not fit in at all.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.640
Don't be silly.
Everyone's gonna love you!

06:29.723 --> 06:32.810
And I'm excited
to show you off.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.397
The general consensus among
the faculty is you don't exist.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.273
Well, I don't know
how I feel about that.

06:38.357 --> 06:41.693
Oh, don't worry. It says more
about me than it does about you.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.864
I'll get it.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.700
It's like dating
the Encyclopedia Britannica.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.620
Oh, hello, Sheldon.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.455
Good evening.
Do you have any idea

06:53.539 --> 06:55.916
where I could obtain
radioactive material?

06:55.999 --> 06:58.794
That's an interesting question.
What do you need it for?

06:58.877 --> 07:00.963
I'm trying to build
a small nuclear reactor

07:01.046 --> 07:03.132
to provide electricity
for my house.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.633
And possibly
the whole neighborhood,

07:04.716 --> 07:05.968
if they're nice to me.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.970
- Fun.
- The problem is, I don't know

07:08.053 --> 07:10.597
where to get the necessary
radioactive material.

07:10.681 --> 07:14.226
Oh. Do you happen to have
any unexploded atomic bombs?

07:14.977 --> 07:16.019
Not a one.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.104
Shoot.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.314
What about an X-ray machine?

07:19.398 --> 07:20.732
Nope.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.527
That makes sense.
You're just a kid.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.446
Oh! I know!

07:25.529 --> 07:28.198
Smoke detectors
contain trace amounts

07:28.282 --> 07:30.492
of americium-241.

07:30.576 --> 07:31.743
Interesting.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.954
But I'd need a lot of them,
and they're expensive.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.622
True.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.375
Hey, I bet if you
call a few companies

07:38.459 --> 07:40.502
and say it's for
a school project,

07:40.586 --> 07:42.087
you could get them for free.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.006
That's a great idea. Thanks.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.717
You're very welcome.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.595
What a cute kid.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.015
Who was that at the door?

07:53.098 --> 07:54.766
- Sheldon.
- What did he want?

07:54.850 --> 07:56.977
Oh, nothing.
He just had a science query.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.937
Ooh, biscuits.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.361
Where's Georgie?

08:06.445 --> 08:08.864
I don't know.
I called him ten minutes ago.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.407
He's probably
curled up in a ball,

08:10.491 --> 08:11.909
crying about Veronica.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.202
Why do you say that?

08:13.285 --> 08:14.365
It's just what I'm hearing.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.121
From who?

08:16.205 --> 08:18.332
I'm kinda plugged
into this town.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.417
I'll go check on him.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.214
Where exactly are you getting
all this info?

08:25.297 --> 08:27.299
There's a lot of kid
sisters out there.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.550
We talk.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.677
Honey?

08:30.761 --> 08:31.887
Can I come in?

08:31.970 --> 08:33.514
<i>No.</i>

08:37.017 --> 08:39.561
Aw, baby,
everything all right?

08:39.645 --> 08:41.480
I don't want to talk about it.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.983
You might feel
better if you do.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.735
Is it about a girl?

08:47.653 --> 08:48.862
How do you know?

08:50.405 --> 08:52.574
Sometimes a mother
can sense these things.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.452
Veronica has a boyfriend.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.662
You mean Dustin?

08:56.745 --> 08:57.829
You know him?

08:58.372 --> 09:00.249
Well, yeah, she met him
through the church.

09:00.332 --> 09:01.792
Lovely young man.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.085
You like him?

09:03.168 --> 09:06.505
Oh. Well, um...

09:06.588 --> 09:10.425
the Lord teaches us
to like everybody.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.095
I just can't stop thinking
about her with another guy,

09:13.178 --> 09:14.805
and it's making me crazy.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.057
Aw. Why don't you come eat
something?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.350
You'll feel better.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.726
I can't.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.812
I feel like I got punched
in the stomach.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.189
Trust me,

09:24.273 --> 09:26.316
this'll pass.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.069
You will meet other girls.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.572
They won't be Veronica.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.158
Is he taller than me?

09:36.326 --> 09:37.327
It doesn't matter.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.705
It's what's inside a person
that counts.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.707
How much taller?

09:41.790 --> 09:43.208
A lot.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.504
Mrs. Sparks' credit card
got declined at Payless.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.839
No kidding.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.007
She went nuts.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.383
But you didn't hear it from me.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.425
Mm.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.012
Poor baby is just crushed.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.096
Oh, man.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.931
I've been through that.
Brutal.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.225
When did I break your heart?

10:00.309 --> 10:01.977
Oh, it wasn't you.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.813
Then who was it?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.898
Oh, doesn't matter.
It was a long time ago.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.692
But who?

10:09.860 --> 10:11.486
Dad, I don't want
to get ahead of myself,

10:11.570 --> 10:13.947
but I think I solved
our electricity problem.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.533
- Not now, Sheldon.
- I wouldn't mind hearing it.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.784
Who?

10:18.827 --> 10:21.204
If you want,
I'll ask around.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.123
<i>For many children,</i>

10:23.206 --> 10:25.584
<i>their happiest memory
is the day they learned</i>

10:25.667 --> 10:27.502
<i>to ride a bike.</i>

10:27.586 --> 10:30.714
<i>For others, it's when they got
their first puppy.</i>

10:31.340 --> 10:32.966
<i>For me, it was the day</i>

10:33.050 --> 10:35.052
<i>I received a box
of 57 defective</i>

10:35.135 --> 10:38.055
<i>smoke detectors
loaded with americium-241.</i>

10:38.138 --> 10:39.765
Yes!

10:41.224 --> 10:43.435
<i>"My dearest Veronica..." No.</i>

10:46.980 --> 10:49.650
<i>"My beloved Veronica..."</i>

10:49.733 --> 10:51.777
Better. It's got "love" in it.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.780
<i>"Every minute I'm away from you
is an eternity.</i>

10:54.863 --> 10:56.698
<i>But it feels longer than that.</i>

10:56.782 --> 11:00.077
<i>I can't eat, I can't sleep,</i>

11:00.160 --> 11:01.828
<i>it's like there's a hole
in my heart</i>

11:01.912 --> 11:04.331
<i>that only your love can fill."</i>

11:04.414 --> 11:05.666
So true.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.584
<i>"And yes, I know about Dustin,</i>

11:07.668 --> 11:09.961
<i>but he can't love you
the way I do.</i>

11:10.045 --> 11:12.964
<i>Because my love
is the kind of love</i>

11:13.048 --> 11:15.425
<i>that is true love.</i>

11:15.509 --> 11:17.594
<i>The kind that lovers feel</i>

11:17.678 --> 11:19.805
<i>when they're in love."</i>

11:19.888 --> 11:21.264
Beautiful.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.767
<i>"So in conclusion, I hope,</i>

11:23.850 --> 11:25.102
<i>no, I pray,</i>

11:25.185 --> 11:26.728
<i>I hope and pray</i>

11:26.812 --> 11:28.397
<i>that you'll give me the chance</i>

11:28.480 --> 11:30.148
<i>to be the boyfriend
you deserve.</i>

11:30.232 --> 11:31.775
<i>And when the time is right,</i>

11:31.858 --> 11:34.861
<i>I'm able to shower you
with diamonds, houses,</i>

11:34.945 --> 11:36.071
<i>boats, and cars,</i>

11:36.154 --> 11:37.572
<i>the husband of your dreams.</i>

11:37.656 --> 11:40.617
<i>Loving you with my heart,
my soul,</i>

11:40.701 --> 11:42.244
<i>and my lips,</i>

11:42.327 --> 11:43.995
<i>Georgie Cooper."</i>

11:44.830 --> 11:46.498
Just tell me her name.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.750
It's not important.
It was a long time ago.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.794
Then how come I don't know
about it?

11:50.877 --> 11:52.921
Because I married you,
and no one else matters.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.297
If that's so,

11:54.381 --> 11:56.299
why'd this mystery woman
break your heart?

11:56.383 --> 11:57.551
Come on, Mare.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.094
We were young.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.679
We were kids.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.180
Leave it alone.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.477
Just tell me her name,
and I'll drop it forever.

12:10.439 --> 12:11.440
You swear?

12:11.523 --> 12:12.524
You know I don't swear.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.775
You promise?

12:13.859 --> 12:15.360
Absolutely.

12:17.446 --> 12:19.489
- Kathryn Dempsey.
- Kathryn Dempsey?!

12:19.573 --> 12:21.384
You watched me make cupcakes
for her daughter's birthday,

12:21.408 --> 12:23.702
and you never told me
you were in love with her?!

12:23.785 --> 12:25.203
I was 15 years old,

12:25.287 --> 12:27.080
and she didn't love me back.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.373
If she did,

12:28.457 --> 12:30.083
would you have married
her instead of me?

12:30.167 --> 12:31.168
But she didn't!

12:31.251 --> 12:32.711
Okay!

12:32.794 --> 12:34.212
Now I have my answer.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.798
Kathryn Dempsey?!

12:37.424 --> 12:39.009
I was 15!

12:44.139 --> 12:45.599
Hey, Sheldon.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.058
Hello, Billy.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.895
- What you doing?
- Building a nuclear reactor.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.814
Cool. I'm having Lucky Charms
for dinner.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.212
What are you gonna do with it
when you're done?

12:58.236 --> 13:01.239
Stand in front of the
refrigerator as long as I want.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.949
Cool.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.285
Why are you eating
cereal for dinner?

13:05.368 --> 13:06.369
I was hungry,

13:06.453 --> 13:08.330
and my parents
are in their bedroom kissing.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.582
<i>♪ Two, three, four ♪</i>

13:21.760 --> 13:25.639

13:40.779 --> 13:42.656
What's this, a love note?

13:42.739 --> 13:44.699
- Give that back!
- Oh, I don't think so.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.327
"To my beloved Veronica,

13:47.410 --> 13:50.038
Every minute I'm away
from you is an eternity.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.666
But it feels longer than that.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.126
"I can't eat,
I can't sleep,

13:55.210 --> 13:57.921
it feels like there's a hole
in my heart that only you

13:58.004 --> 14:00.048
can fill..."♪♪

14:11.017 --> 14:12.435
Champagne?

14:13.311 --> 14:14.729
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.857
These are for me.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.441
Are... are you all right?

14:18.525 --> 14:20.360
No, I'm very nervous.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.820
That's interesting.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.780
Normally, I'm the one
who's unsure of himself

14:23.864 --> 14:25.115
in a social situation,

14:25.198 --> 14:26.700
but tonight, it's you.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.827
Yeah.
Frickin' fascinating.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.745
Dr. Sturgis,
good to see you.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.414
Dr. Linkletter.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.457
Please meet my girlfriend,

14:34.541 --> 14:35.876
Connie Tucker.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.377
Nice to meet you, Dr. Tucker.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.795
I'm not a doctor.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.255
But I would like
to point out,

14:40.338 --> 14:41.464
she's quite real.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.633
- I can see that.
- And our relationship

14:43.717 --> 14:45.051
is more

14:45.135 --> 14:47.137
- than just friends.
- That's enough.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.388
In fact,

14:48.471 --> 14:50.056
it's flat-out erotic.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.975
Change the subject, John.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.311
You got it, girlfriend.

14:54.394 --> 14:58.231
Dr. Linkletter is working
on an intriguing theory

14:58.315 --> 15:00.525
of quantum gravity.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.402
- Is that so?
- He can explain it

15:02.485 --> 15:04.571
much better than I can.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.198
Are you familiar at all
with string theory?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.075
Remind me.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.178
Well, basically, it's a string
theoretic interpretation

15:11.202 --> 15:12.495
of the graviton.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.498
Every force is an exchange
of particles.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.084
Gravity is the exchange
of gravitons.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.253
Meemaw, are you even listening?

15:20.337 --> 15:21.338
What?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.715
The graviton
is a massless string.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.634
The graviton is
a massless string.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.553
- Wow!
- Well, yes, it is.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.513
When did you learn that?

15:30.597 --> 15:32.766
I get around.

15:33.308 --> 15:34.768
In fact,
I would go so far as to say

15:34.851 --> 15:36.770
that every force is an exchange
of particles,

15:36.853 --> 15:39.564
and gravity
is an exchange of gravitons.

15:39.648 --> 15:40.606
Correct!

15:40.607 --> 15:42.233
Yes!

15:42.317 --> 15:43.985
John, where have you
been hiding her?

15:44.069 --> 15:45.070
I haven't.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.696
I've talked about her
quite a bit,

15:46.780 --> 15:49.240
but you all said she was
a figment of my imagination.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.701
She's dynamite.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.830
Hello. I'd like to speak
to Arthur Jeffries.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.999
He plays Professor Proton.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.542
But you probably know that,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.503
since you answer the phone
at the station

16:01.586 --> 16:04.714
that makes the show,
you lucky duck.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.634
Then I'd like to leave him
another message.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.844
Please tell him Sheldon Cooper
called again

16:09.928 --> 16:11.280
and that
I've successfully obtained

16:11.304 --> 16:14.099
the radioactive material
that I'm looking for.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.768
Yes, americium-241.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.770
I have lots of it.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.856
I live at 5501 Grant Avenue,

16:21.940 --> 16:23.400
Medford, Texas.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.203
If you're sending me
an autographed picture,

16:25.276 --> 16:26.611
I already have one.

16:26.695 --> 16:29.447
Ooh, how about one
of his bow ties?

16:29.531 --> 16:31.074
And then Bryan Larkin
read the letter

16:31.157 --> 16:33.827
- out loud in the hall.
- No.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.162
Georgie used the word "love,"
like, 30 times.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.580
It was pathetic.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.790
That hurts to hear.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.376
Really? I think it's hilarious.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.713
Also, my math teacher's
pregnant.

16:44.796 --> 16:45.922
Well, that's nice.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.925
It might not be her husband's.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.178
Whose do you think it is?

16:58.309 --> 16:59.310
Hey.

16:59.394 --> 17:00.395
Hey.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.604
Going somewhere?

17:02.147 --> 17:04.607
Alaska.
Gonna work on the pipeline.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.942
Alaska, huh?

17:06.026 --> 17:07.527
That... that's pretty far.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.529
Not far enough,
but it'll have to do.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.906
Look, Georgie,

17:12.699 --> 17:15.076
I know it feels bad
right now, but...

17:15.160 --> 17:16.661
I promise it'll get better.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.538
How's it gonna get better?

17:18.621 --> 17:19.914
Veronica thinks I'm a jerk,

17:19.998 --> 17:22.333
and everyone in the school's
calling me Lovey Cooper.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.252
Oof, that is not a good name.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.775
It doesn't matter, 'cause I'm
never going back to that school.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.965
Listen to me.
Hey.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.846
You're a good-looking kid,
and you got a big heart.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.308
Once we get you
on a daily shower schedule,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.060
the girls
are gonna be lining up.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.603
I don't want girls.

17:41.686 --> 17:42.812
I want Veronica.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.981
Yeah, maybe you'll get her
and maybe you won't.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.733
But someday,
you'll find the woman

17:46.816 --> 17:48.443
who was really meant for you.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.361
You mean like
Kathryn Dempsey?

17:50.445 --> 17:51.529
Alaska's beautiful.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.989
How 'bout I go with you?

17:53.782 --> 17:55.200
Who's Kathryn Dempsey?

17:55.283 --> 17:56.659
I was 15 years...

17:56.743 --> 17:59.120
I was 15 years old!

18:01.706 --> 18:03.958
Connie, tell me,
did you grow up in Texas?

18:04.042 --> 18:06.795
Took my first bath
in a ten-gallon hat.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.755
That's wonderful.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.257
My goodness, you're as funny
as you are beautiful.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.468
That's a nice thing to say

18:13.551 --> 18:14.886
to your friend's
girlfriend.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.639
Actually, I don't think
it is so nice.

18:17.722 --> 18:18.890
If I didn't know any better,

18:18.973 --> 18:22.143
I'd say you were sweet-talking
my date right in front of me.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.395
You're a pretty smart man, John.
Trust your gut.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.648
Oh, look!

18:26.731 --> 18:28.566
Shrimp cocktail.
Let's get some.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.444
Now, hang on.
Hey. Take your hand off her,

18:31.528 --> 18:33.404
or there are gonna be
some severe consequences.

18:33.488 --> 18:34.989
Whoa, John, calm down.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.324
What do you see in this guy?

18:36.407 --> 18:37.407
All right, that's it!

18:39.077 --> 18:40.745
Oh, boy,
you shouldn't have done that.

18:40.829 --> 18:41.913
Oh!

18:41.996 --> 18:44.791
That's enough! Both of you,
just cool your jets.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.418
This isn't over,
Dr. Linkletter!

18:47.502 --> 18:50.380
Anytime, anyplace,
Dr. Sturgis.

18:50.463 --> 18:55.468
And your graviton research
is mediocre at best!

18:55.552 --> 18:58.138
Keep moving.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.181
- Are you angry with me?
- More turned on.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.100
Ooh. Great. Let's go.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.483
Good morning, Mary.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.568
Hmm.

19:14.904 --> 19:15.989
What's that about?

19:16.865 --> 19:18.867
- I'm punishing him.
- What for?

19:18.950 --> 19:19.951
Nothing, really,

19:20.034 --> 19:21.870
but once I got started,
I couldn't stop.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.290
<i>I'll get it!</i>
