Reporter on TV: <i>After successful
visits to Jordan and Egypt,</i>

00:07.408 --> 00:09.341
<i>President Meyer's
Middle East peace tour</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:10.642
<i>continues with her trip
to Israel.</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:13.078
You lose your job, you're
radioactive for a while.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.113
That's just how it works.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.682
Yes, I am taking care
of myself, Mother.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.417
No, I didn't send her
a get-well card

00:18.419 --> 00:22.521
'cause you don't get a get-well
card when you have plastic surgery.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.722
I've got to go.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.725
'Cause I'm...
I'm going for a run.

00:26.727 --> 00:27.493
Okay, bye.

00:27.495 --> 00:30.162
I've extended my stay
in Israel for another day.

00:30.164 --> 00:33.399
So I may need to borrow
some toothpaste.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.601
( laughs )

00:35.603 --> 00:37.069
<i>( TV turns off )</i>

00:37.071 --> 00:40.706
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

00:48.482 --> 00:51.683
President Meyer has ended
her 10-day world tour

00:51.685 --> 00:54.219
with a surprise visit to Iran.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.054
Her historic meeting

00:55.056 --> 00:57.656
could signal an end
to decades of mistrust.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.292
See that tour?
I set that up.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.694
See that shelf?
I made that.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.564
Reporter: <i>It's believed President
Meyer may also secure the release</i>

01:05.566 --> 01:08.667
of detained American
reporter Leon West.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.303
Mike: <i>This trip is
like a miracle.</i>

01:11.305 --> 01:12.805
Where's the woman
who changed world politics?

01:12.807 --> 01:14.840
- She's taking a piss.
- She's freshening up.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.242
I'm so tired,
I could sleep a horse.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.444
Or whatever that word thing is.

01:18.446 --> 01:22.081
Wait, Ben, is this Ambien? How
many of these have you taken?

01:22.083 --> 01:22.781
Look, I need to sleep.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.317
I got all jacked up
on licorice last night

01:25.319 --> 01:27.119
and I was belly dancing
till dawn.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.588
- Is it time to get Leon yet?
- Oh, checking.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.290
Imagine being detained
for two weeks

01:31.292 --> 01:33.725
just 'cause you're a
journalist and a shithead.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.660
Yeah.
( chuckles )

01:34.662 --> 01:36.862
It's a good job we had nothing
to do with his being detained.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.431
- Yeah, wouldn't that be terrible?
- Mm-hmm.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.667
Wait, did we have
something to do with...?

01:41.669 --> 01:44.136
¶ Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
you better cheer ¶

01:44.138 --> 01:46.271
¶ For the president
of the year. ¶

01:46.273 --> 01:47.606
- Yeah!
- ( laughing )

01:47.608 --> 01:49.374
- Hey, you know what you are?
- What?

01:49.376 --> 01:51.243
- You're an amazing man.
- Thank you.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.112
- And you know what amazing men get?
- What?

01:53.114 --> 01:54.513
- Two-day weekend.
- This weekend?

01:54.515 --> 01:57.883
- Yeah.
- I'm going to the cottage with Wendy!

01:57.885 --> 01:58.817
( laughing )

01:58.819 --> 02:02.221
- ( phone pings ) - Oh, they're
detaining Leon for one more hour.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.624
Oh, God. I have to wait here another
hour before we can fly out?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.326
You have to get a photo
with Leon West, ma'am.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.596
- Yeah. - It's the one and only
time anyone's ever gonna say that.

02:10.598 --> 02:11.864
Let's use the hour, then, okay?

02:11.866 --> 02:14.800
Let's cure diabetes
or learn Italian.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.235
Why don't you take a nap?

02:16.237 --> 02:17.803
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna sleep again.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.638
I gotta run around
like a Labrador

02:19.640 --> 02:21.306
or a guy on fire
or something like that.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.143
Iran. Iran!
Isn't that amazing?

02:24.145 --> 02:26.512
Ooh, I've got to go to the bathroom again.
I'll be right back.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.248
- Gary: Wow, she's excited.
- She's fucking nuts.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.251
How are the folks
on the press plane?

02:32.253 --> 02:32.818
Sober.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.487
They got the shakes so bad, I
think I see the plane rattling.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.589
Well, you've got to tell them
we got to stay another hour.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.691
An hour? These guys could
be drinking jet fuel.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.426
- ( Mike laughs )
- Whoa, out of my way!

02:41.428 --> 02:42.895
It was a false alarm.
I don't know why.

02:42.897 --> 02:45.364
Hey, ma'am, why don't I give you
a shoulder massage or something?

02:45.366 --> 02:47.299
- It'll kind of help you unwind, defocus.
- <i>No!</i>

02:47.301 --> 02:49.168
I don't want to defocus.
I'm all focus.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.371
I could, like, bang a nail
into that wall with my gaze.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.872
Do you know what I mean?
You having fun?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.307
- Yes.
- Are you having fun?

02:55.309 --> 02:57.276
- So much fun.
- What kind of wood is this table?

02:57.278 --> 02:59.311
- I don't know. Let me check.
- I think it's ash.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.879
- Gary: Uh-uh.
- I'm gonna redo my kitchen.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.215
<i>Ma'am, you think you want to
think about this right now?</i>

03:03.217 --> 03:04.550
Yeah, sure.
I mean, we've got time.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.884
- We've got an hour.
- <i>Do we? Okay.</i>

03:05.886 --> 03:07.352
I'm gonna get all new cabinets.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.454
And I want to match this except
I don't like these knots.

03:09.456 --> 03:12.524
Bill: <i>Now that the president's
tour has been extended by a day,</i>

03:12.526 --> 03:16.228
the vice president will be picking
up part of the president's schedule

03:16.230 --> 03:18.430
starting with
the Rainbow Jersey event

03:18.432 --> 03:21.266
<i>supporting
all sexualities in sports</i>

03:21.268 --> 03:23.802
with NBA star
Freddy Wallace. Yes?

03:23.804 --> 03:26.371
How do you respond to
Senator O'Brien's comment...

03:26.373 --> 03:29.575
That the American people need a
president, not a Meyertollah?

03:29.577 --> 03:31.443
It's a cheap pun,
so absolutely expect...

03:31.445 --> 03:34.413
- That finishing sentences thing is...
- Irritating? Very.

03:34.415 --> 03:38.717
But sometimes necessary when
people are being slow or dull.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.919
- Yes?
- When's Mike back?

03:40.921 --> 03:42.921
Hilarious.
Well done.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.756
No people skills.
Like a robot.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.458
- Hmm.
- Reporter: <i>on the background</i>

03:46.460 --> 03:48.393
<i>of the detained
US journalist Leon West?</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:49.928
( chatter, laughter )

03:49.930 --> 03:52.631
Guys. Guys.
Sorry about the delay.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.300
Turns out the Iranians need
everything in triplicate.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.436
Maybe that's 'cause
they invented numbers, huh?

03:57.438 --> 03:58.837
- How's Leon doing?
- <i>He's fine.</i>

03:58.839 --> 04:00.539
<i>They're releasing him
any minute.</i>

04:00.541 --> 04:03.809
Let's face it, he's probably gonna
get a book deal out of this.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.645
See that?
Catlike reflexes.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.481
Oh, and maybe
don't start drinking...

04:09.483 --> 04:11.650
- Man: Heads up! - ...till
you're up in the air

04:11.652 --> 04:12.951
out of courtesy
to our host nation.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.320
- Man ♪2: Catch!
- Man ♪3: <i> Just open the bar!</i>

04:15.322 --> 04:18.724
- ( journalists laughing )
- Great chatting.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.692
Wow, Freddy Wallace.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.263
Hall of Famer.
Mr. Gay NBA.

04:24.265 --> 04:27.466
In my family,
basketball is a religion.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.600
Also Catholicism.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.768
That's actually the main one.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.470
Oh, hey, guys. Can you
get Freddy's autograph?

04:31.472 --> 04:34.039
- It's for my friend's son.
- Who should he make it out to?

04:34.041 --> 04:37.476
- Sue Wilson. He's named after me.
- Oh.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.678
- Is this the speech?
- Yes, sir.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.513
- Any snags?
- No, all good.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.950
Sir, Freddy Wallace
may use the term LGBT.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.786
I remember it this way... L is
for ladies who play tennis,

04:47.788 --> 04:49.054
G is for guys who do other guys,

04:49.056 --> 04:52.858
B is for bisexual... I couldn't
think of one to go for that...

04:52.860 --> 04:56.595
- and T... - Is for tucking
it in or tacking it on.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.830
- ( laughs ) - It's
transgender, actually.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.767
Thanks for killing my joke
and then mutilating it.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.503
Well, as my grandfather
never said,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.004
let's go be inclusive.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.806
Have you seen Kent's polling?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.074
I could not be more likable

05:09.076 --> 05:12.844
if I had given both of my
kidneys to some sick kid.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.079
- ( laughs )
- God Almighty!

05:14.081 --> 05:15.480
Gary, I want some champagne.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.684
- Mm-hmm.
- Ma'am, we're in a tea totalitarian state.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.385
Look at these numbers.
I keep staring at them.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.055
I'm gonna make this, like, a screensaver.
Wonder how you do that.

05:23.057 --> 05:27.659
The Rainbow Jersey shows that
there's no place for discrimination

05:27.661 --> 05:29.494
either on or off the court.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.831
And I'm proud to have
the president...

05:32.833 --> 05:35.067
I'm sorry, the vice president...

05:35.069 --> 05:38.103
- ( chuckles )
- on my team.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.572
- Sparkling water.
- Thank you.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.107
I put the champagne
in the water bottles.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.776
- You don't have to explain. I
can tell what you did. - Yeah.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.078
Selina:
<i>Oh, look at Doyle.</i>

05:46.080 --> 05:48.347
<i>- Did he have his teeth capped?</i>
- Ben: <i> Oh, my God.</i>

05:48.349 --> 05:51.116
The last surviving Golden Girl.

05:51.118 --> 05:51.850
( laughs )

05:51.852 --> 05:55.354
Almost put him in the
penalty box for that,

05:55.356 --> 05:56.955
but that's hockey, so...

05:56.957 --> 05:58.423
I'm gonna say
a little something.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.959
Wasn't this originally
written for POTUS?

06:00.961 --> 06:02.127
A speech is a speech.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.463
Phonemes connecting
to produce meanings.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.866
Sports can bring us together,

06:07.868 --> 06:11.403
help end homophobia.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.039
When I was a... boy,

06:14.041 --> 06:16.575
it was my gay friends

06:16.577 --> 06:19.511
who taught me how to be tolerant

06:19.513 --> 06:23.548
and how to be true to yourself

06:23.550 --> 06:26.051
and how to dance to Madonna.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.986
- Gary: Madonna?
- Selina: What?

06:27.988 --> 06:30.422
- ( Ben snickers ) - Was
I supposed to say that?

06:30.424 --> 06:32.924
You know, back in college, my...

06:32.926 --> 06:37.162
girlfriends would...
Boyfriends... my friends...

06:37.164 --> 06:39.164
Perhaps it did need
some reworking.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.167
Thank you so much
for your assistance, Abbas.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.035
They're bringing
the journalist out.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.638
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Leon? Oh, God, no.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.807
He is the asshole
of an asshole's asshole.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.109
I feel bad for the guys
who had to guard him.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.011
- Mike.
- Leon.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.780
A face I never thought
I'd want to kiss.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.481
- I still don't.
- Nice hotel?

06:56.483 --> 06:58.550
Yeah, I'll have something to
say about it on TripAdvisor.

06:58.552 --> 07:02.020
- Worst minibar ever.
- Amongst other things, yeah.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.189
Oh, this is Abbas, our liaison.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.491
- Leon West.
- Apologies, Mr. West.

07:06.493 --> 07:09.094
Both countries had
to deny the visit,

07:09.096 --> 07:10.862
but now we confirm.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.930
Wait, both countries?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.598
Uh, his English isn't very good.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.733
Leon:
<i>It sounded fine to me.</i>

07:14.735 --> 07:17.702
And you, sir, get to fly
home on Air Force One.

07:17.704 --> 07:18.804
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.739
I'm shallow enough
for that to be exciting.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.974
Did you know it can survive
a nuclear blast?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.009
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.777
Not that you guys
are planning one.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.613
I... ignore me. I don't
know why I said that.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.949
His English isn't very good.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.784
( laughs )
Well, let's get you going.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.687
The president has a big-ass
scotch on the rocks for you.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.924
- Yeah.
- Which is iced tea. It's iced tea.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.793
- Thank you, Abbas.
- Mike.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.495
Thank you.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.634
- Safe trip.
- Safe stay.

07:49.636 --> 07:54.706
So let's celebrate
all things L and GBT.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.842
- Huh?
- ( applause )

07:56.844 --> 08:01.880
Though these days we use
the more inclusive LGBTQ.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.015
We do!

08:04.017 --> 08:07.252
Um, and I...

08:07.254 --> 08:11.656
respect all people's
rights to be a Q.

08:11.658 --> 08:15.026
<i>Or rather just Q.</i>

08:15.028 --> 08:16.027
Yeah, just Q.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.497
Sounds like he's learning
a sex alphabet.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.966
I've seen a salmon
in a grizzly's mouth

08:20.968 --> 08:23.668
- look less panicky than that.
- ( laughs )

08:23.670 --> 08:26.805
Everybody knows that Q
means questioning.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.708
( laughing )

08:30.844 --> 08:32.077
Ironically, the straight guy

08:32.078 --> 08:34.578
- is very stiff around the gay guy.
- ( stifled laugh )

08:34.581 --> 08:37.682
Our polling said that
he was widely perceived

08:37.683 --> 08:39.518
as quite wooden.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.885
Why were you polling him?

08:40.888 --> 08:43.188
I was polling him against other
potential running mates.

08:43.190 --> 08:47.526
- Amy: Just move!
- I'm not a backwards walker, Amy.

08:47.528 --> 08:50.095
The president promised Doyle
he'd be on the ticket

08:50.097 --> 08:54.533
and she wouldn't poll other
possible running mates.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.534
No one told me that.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.270
Yet again, the left hand has no
idea what the right hand is doing

08:58.272 --> 09:02.307
and the freakish middle hand is
punching me repeatedly in the tits.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.643
- Well, that was an education.
- ( groans )

09:04.645 --> 09:06.578
I mean, what I really want
to do is get into lobbying.

09:06.580 --> 09:10.849
But it's only been, like, six weeks and
three days, so I'm not sweating it.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.084
Oh, hold on.
I got another call.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.288
Sidney, hey!
It's so funny.

09:16.290 --> 09:19.658
I was literally just commenting
to a friend about lobb...

09:19.660 --> 09:22.661
Yeah, you're right,
that's not interesting.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.763
Yes, I would love to come in.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.065
Dan:
<i>So this is PKM.</i>

09:27.067 --> 09:28.633
<i>This place is huge.</i>

09:28.635 --> 09:30.268
Yep. Wait till you see
the dolphinarium.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.770
It's right near
the Latin Quarter.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.572
And he's got
the red-light district.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.006
God, this place is so awesome.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.575
I kind of feel
like hitting on it.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.343
Well, there's women here you
can do that to if you wanted.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.012
- I noticed. Oh.
- So, Dan, here's my pitch.

09:41.014 --> 09:45.917
I can make you so rich, you can pay
Bill Gates to give you a lap dance.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.985
Let me hear your pitch.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.287
Well, I'm smart,
well-connected...

09:49.289 --> 09:51.590
And fired.
Yeah, don't forget fired.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.657
- Fired up...
- Oh, okay.

09:52.659 --> 09:55.360
To put my contacts
to work for your clients.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.895
Well, that's music to my wallet.

09:56.897 --> 10:01.032
But are you ready to take a dump
on Mike McLintock's doorstep?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.934
Like an initiation
kind of thing?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.203
No, I mean, can you
take on clients

10:05.205 --> 10:08.139
who are best served by you
shitting on the Meyer agenda?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.941
Oh, well, let me
think about that.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.076
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.211
We'll get to that doorstep
thing later, though.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.879
Yeah, I'll still do that.
I'm into it.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.949
Mike: <i>Ma'am, may I present
the hero of the hour</i>

10:17.951 --> 10:18.984
<i>along with yourself.</i>

10:18.986 --> 10:20.318
Welcome aboard Air Force One.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.821
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, gosh. Oh.

10:22.823 --> 10:23.989
<i>( camera clicking )</i>

10:23.991 --> 10:26.157
Okay, are we still doing it?

10:27.027 --> 10:29.227
Okay.
Great, yeah.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.630
- He needs deodorant.
- Uh-huh.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.699
Well, I am so happy
to see you, Leon.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.035
We really did work
tirelessly for your release.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.038
Well, thank you, Madam President.
I haven't slept very much.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.073
Well, I'm sure food is the
last thing on your mind.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.742
I know it's the last
thing on my mind.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.343
- I wonder if you're hungry, though.
- Yes, I am.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.078
Because I'll tell you
something, the adrenaline

10:47.080 --> 10:50.749
on this Mideast trip has just
kept me from eating anything.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.651
Did you just say you do
want something to eat?

10:52.653 --> 10:53.818
- Yes, thank you.
- You do?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.820
- Oh, is that food?
- No.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.857
It's a...
It's deodorant.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.793
Huh. Uh...

11:02.262 --> 11:03.161
Uh, all right.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.663
What would you like to eat?

11:04.665 --> 11:06.831
Anything that's not chickpeas.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.266
( both laugh )

11:08.268 --> 11:13.271
Hey! Why are those lovely long
legs walking away from me?

11:13.273 --> 11:14.406
Probably means you.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.141
Yeah, it's okay.
I got... I got this.

11:16.143 --> 11:19.144
I am not in the blame game,
but that rainbow-colored

11:19.146 --> 11:20.979
clusterfuck in there
was entirely your fault.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.715
Whoa, okay, no. Kent Davison
polled other candidates for veep.

11:23.717 --> 11:27.285
What the fuck? Did you just throw Kent
into the blender to save your own ass?

11:27.287 --> 11:30.121
Not fully into the blender. Maybe just
a little bit. Just the toe, 'cause...

11:30.123 --> 11:33.692
That is the Jonah I've been trying to
wake up since the day you got here.

11:33.694 --> 11:37.796
And Kent Davison is
a disloyal fucking prick.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.797
I fucking hate Kent.

11:38.799 --> 11:42.233
I want to wipe that neutral
expression off his face.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.902
- Here's how we're gonna do it.
- Okay.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.771
We're gonna leak
that the VP is dissatisfied

11:46.773 --> 11:48.006
and that he's thinking
of walking.

11:48.008 --> 11:51.042
We're gonna force
POTUS to back Doyle.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.110
I will not let you down.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.280
All right, so what kind of
media contacts do you have?

11:55.282 --> 11:57.382
- Liz Kerrigan.
- Liz?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.417
- Liz.
- How hard can you work this Liz?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.986
Oh, my God. I can ride her
hard, hang her up wet.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.321
I like what I'm seeing,
all right?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.856
- Show me more.
- Thank you, I will.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.424
- Give 'em both barrels. - Oh!

12:06.426 --> 12:07.425
Fucking nightmare.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.094
Selina: <i>It's just been
such a magical time.</i>

12:09.096 --> 12:11.996
And I wish I could have visited
every country in the whole world.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.264
You know?
Even New Zealand.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.867
People are now comparing me
to Nixon, I heard, right?

12:15.869 --> 12:18.503
- They didn't mean your looks.
- No, no, no, I don't mean that.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.105
But, I mean, I'll take
the comparison.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.473
So where would you
like to begin?

12:21.475 --> 12:23.274
Well, I don't really know
what's happened lately

12:23.276 --> 12:27.011
because I've been locked in a hotel room
without access to the outside world.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.313
Of course. You know
what we need to do?

12:28.315 --> 12:29.914
We need to get Leon
some of the press clippings.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.282
I think he'd like
to see some of those.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.984
- Should I check on his food first?
- Yes.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.753
- No, no, get him the press clippings.
- Yeah.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.856
First of all, the talks
in Israel went so well

12:37.858 --> 12:39.958
that I was delayed a day
getting here.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.927
And then the talks here
were just amazing.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.997
So, just to clarify,
you were delayed by a day.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.134
- Yeah.
- My release was delayed by a day.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.802
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.337
Here's those press clippings.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.939
What I would like you to do
is check on Leon's food.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.041
- 'Cause I know you're hungry.
- Yeah.

12:57.043 --> 13:01.146
- Ben, wake up. - Gary, why are
you giving me all that Ambien?

13:01.148 --> 13:03.214
- Mike. Mike. It's Mike.
- Mike. Mike.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.016
Mike: <i>We got a problem
with the vice president.</i>

13:05.018 --> 13:06.451
Okay, um, hang...
I'll be right back.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.319
- I don't know what this is all about.
- Sure.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.888
- What's going on?
- Ma'am, Liz Kerrigan

13:09.890 --> 13:11.289
is running a story
that Doyle is unhappy.

13:11.291 --> 13:15.193
Should I go and see if there's any
chatter about this on the press plane?

13:15.195 --> 13:17.328
Christ, it's that data fuck.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.530
No. I don't know.
Yes.

13:18.532 --> 13:19.964
Let's just go with I don't know.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.466
Okay, please nobody look,
but Leon's watching.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.434
Selina: <i>Okay, so just go
in there and distract him.</i>

13:23.436 --> 13:25.470
Give him a handjob
if you have to,

13:25.472 --> 13:27.438
just get it done, okay?

13:27.440 --> 13:31.242
Wow, two weeks detained.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.110
That is hard.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.445
- I was in a hotel, so it wasn't that bad.
- Oh, no.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.882
Leon is starting to think that
his release was delayed by a day

13:37.884 --> 13:39.551
because my arrival here
was delayed by a day.

13:39.553 --> 13:42.453
He's gonna figure out that we
didn't okay his release till now

13:42.455 --> 13:44.322
and then he'll write
something bad about that.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.557
- That could be bad.
- Yeah.

13:45.559 --> 13:46.925
- That is bad.
- It is bad.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.593
And Leon wanting to say it's bad

13:48.595 --> 13:49.828
is really bad.
It's worse.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.830
Okay, look, in seven seconds,
you come in there, Ben,

13:51.832 --> 13:56.000
you grab me by the hair and you drag
me out, okay? Are you listening?

13:56.002 --> 13:56.935
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.538
We got to find out where this
Doyle story is coming from.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.440
I'll check out the press plane.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.508
You must be very tired.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.510
Would you like to put a
pin in this for a moment?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.979
Some people might think
that the American government

14:07.981 --> 14:09.447
detaining an American journalist

14:09.449 --> 14:12.250
so that you can have
a photo op might look bad.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.351
<i>Can you see that?</i>

14:13.353 --> 14:16.988
- Leon, I respect you so much
as a journalist. - Thank you.

14:16.990 --> 14:21.526
And when Ben and I were first
discussing the peace talks,

14:21.528 --> 14:24.128
I said to Ben,
I said, "Ben. Ben, I..."

14:24.130 --> 14:25.396
Ma'am, State Department.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.867
- This I've got to take. Excuse me. Hello?
- Leon: Never stops, does it?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.335
- Leon, you need to rest.
- Mm-hmm.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.238
I just had one second
of sleep and I feel great.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.442
Okay, maybe the guys in the press
plane would like me to go over there

14:37.444 --> 14:42.046
and tell them about the US government
imprisoning a guy in Iran.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.082
Go get Mike
from the press plane.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.617
- Fucking idiots.
- Selina: <i> Yeah.</i>

14:45.619 --> 14:47.185
We've got to hold him
hostage here.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.053
Do you understand?
We've got to take off now.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.421
Mike and Gary are off the plane.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.090
We have a pilot
on the plane, right?

14:52.092 --> 14:54.058
Okay, so let's go.
We've got to go.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.260
Leon, you've got to sit down.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.996
I'm a bad flier and I might
need somebody to hold me.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.365
Are you seriously
detaining me again?

15:00.367 --> 15:01.466
Am I being rendered?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.401
No, you're being friendered.

15:03.403 --> 15:08.673
So just please accept
our compulsory hospitality.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.309
Oh, Jesus, that suit.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.077
My gosh, you look like
a middle-school teacher.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.581
Okay, that's Erica. She's gonna take
you out and buy you some real suits.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.483
Not these government-issued
rags you're wearing.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.252
She's not exactly
government-issue herself, is she?

15:21.254 --> 15:25.089
- Yeah. Hey, don't even look at her.
- Oh.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.125
I'm kidding.
Or am I?

15:27.127 --> 15:29.594
Huh? No, seriously, I'm
just fucking with you, Dan.

15:29.596 --> 15:34.933
So listen, tonight we're gonna put you
on TV as a political commentator.

15:34.935 --> 15:35.566
- Yes!
- Yeah?

15:35.568 --> 15:38.002
Finally, something good
to watch on the idiot box.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.672
We've just started lobbying
for glacé cherries,

15:40.674 --> 15:42.140
so mention glacé cherries.

15:42.142 --> 15:45.476
Well, how do I work in glacé cherries
into a political roundtable?

15:45.478 --> 15:48.146
You'll figure it out. Listen,
you give me glacé cherries,

15:48.148 --> 15:51.582
and I'll give you a bed of money
with pussy on the nightstand.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.985
Maybe Erica.
But not her.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.620
- No.
- But maybe.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.422
( laughs )
We'll just let that hang.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.357
- Yeah, yeah. I know.
- Stay on your toes, buddy.

15:59.359 --> 16:04.195
It's gonna be like that the
entire time you're here.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.468
Hey, that's Air Force One.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.971
Oh, my God. What the
hell is happening?

16:12.973 --> 16:15.173
- Why are they leaving us?
- Are we at war?

16:15.175 --> 16:17.475
- Is it here? Sweet Jesus.
- No, it can't be. It can't be.

16:17.477 --> 16:21.245
- Oh, sweet Jesus.
- Stop saying Jesus. Stop it!

16:21.247 --> 16:22.647
Leon:
<i>This is how I see it.</i>

16:22.649 --> 16:24.716
I say the US is planning
a secret trip.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.552
The Iranians ask you
to confirm the secret trip.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.655
You say there's no secret
trip because it's a secret.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.258
They think I'm James Bond
and detain me.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.562
Leon, you're no
fucking James Bond.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.730
Journalism is storytelling.

16:38.732 --> 16:43.134
You tell your story about
your bravery, your integrity

16:43.136 --> 16:45.536
and how we rescued you
and gave you warm nuts.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.172
The Iranians detained me
because of you.

16:48.174 --> 16:48.740
That's my story.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.476
They detained me
an extra day because of you.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.477
That's my other story.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.513
Now, you want to be rescued
or not, you ungrateful shit?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.448
My release was delayed
because the president

16:57.450 --> 17:00.251
wanted to grab the headlines
for freeing an American,

17:00.253 --> 17:03.621
an American she deliberately
did not de-detain.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.590
Jonah, either get
Leon's mom to the air base

17:06.593 --> 17:09.193
or buy yourself
a very convincing wig.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.795
- Where's Kent?
- I don't know.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.530
Maybe he's bitten off
his tracking device.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.298
He should be here by now.
This is not okay.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.434
- Mike.
- Break out the yellow ribbon, Sue.

17:16.435 --> 17:20.405
- We are stranded in Iran.
- I'm really scared, Sue.

17:20.406 --> 17:23.107
Man up, Gary.
Or at least lady down a bit.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.242
Gary and Mike have been
left behind in Iran.

17:25.244 --> 17:27.478
Wonderful. It's "Black Hawk
Down" with Laurel and Hardy.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.448
Amy, if anyone asks, no one's
been left behind in Iran.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.550
There you are.
Where have you been?

17:32.552 --> 17:33.618
I grew a small beard here.

17:33.620 --> 17:37.221
Bill, of my various walking paces,
I selected moderate to fast.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.390
The press are saying that the VP
is unhappy with the president.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.492
- That doesn't make me happy.
- Because of the secret polling?

17:41.494 --> 17:45.129
Or because he's heard that someone has
hacked the data of dead children?

17:45.131 --> 17:47.532
Or a third reason which
is even worse than those?

17:47.534 --> 17:49.801
We've got to get inside Doyle's
head, find out what he knows.

17:49.803 --> 17:53.237
- Get out.
- No, come in. You get out.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.672
Mike, why exactly
are you calling me?

17:54.674 --> 17:58.176
- What do we do, Sue?
- <i>There's a backup plane.</i>

17:58.178 --> 18:00.711
<i>Find the backup plane.</i>

18:00.713 --> 18:02.814
- Mike: Come on!
- Gary: Oh, my God. Where is it?

18:02.816 --> 18:04.515
- Mike: I don't know!
- Gary: Oh, shit!

18:04.517 --> 18:08.319
- Mike: Pardonne. Pardonne.
- Gary: That's French!

18:08.788 --> 18:11.656
Ooh, am I in the wrong place?

18:11.658 --> 18:13.424
- Is this QVC?
- Amy.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.594
Hmm. Hear you're lobbying
with Sidney Purcell now.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.396
The man whose dream
vacation is hunting

18:18.398 --> 18:20.731
the street kids of Rio
on a human safari.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.533
Not lobbying.
No, that'd be illegal.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.502
I'm a consultant. And I
gotta say, I like the guy

18:24.504 --> 18:27.371
a hell of a lot more ever since
he told me how rich I'm gonna be.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.707
Sorry you got fired. You were
almost good at your job,

18:29.709 --> 18:31.542
which really made you stand out.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.543
Right back at you.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.346
Can't be this nice to each
other on air, you know.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.615
Oh, I know.
May the best man win.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.485
- And that'll be me.
- Which will be me.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.488
Mike! Mike!

18:43.490 --> 18:45.623
I found the backup plane.
Come on.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.457
Thank God.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.126
I've never had strong
feelings for a plane,

18:48.128 --> 18:50.828
but right now I would cheat
on Wendy with that thing.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.264
Jonah, we need to talk.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.600
We are just in the car
with Leon West's mother.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.901
Do you need anything, ma'am?

18:56.903 --> 18:58.903
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

18:58.905 --> 18:59.737
Great.

18:59.739 --> 19:03.341
Jonah, I know something's
happening at the VP's office.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.809
Oh.
Okay, you do.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.512
Bill: <i>I need you to tell
me what's going on.</i>

19:07.514 --> 19:10.481
And, uh, do I have to
tell you that right now?

19:10.483 --> 19:11.149
Yes, you do.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.284
I was thinking we could
stop for a coffee.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.253
Uh, Teddy's been touching me.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.587
Richard:
<i>Or tea.</i>

19:16.589 --> 19:18.723
Uh, just processing that.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.690
Wait, Mr. Davison?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.559
<i>Shit, am I on speakerphone?</i>

19:21.561 --> 19:24.462
Sorry, Jonah,
what happened exactly?

19:26.833 --> 19:29.767
Um, well, he...

19:29.769 --> 19:32.937
He... he cupped
my testicles.

19:32.939 --> 19:36.607
<i>On another occasion, he patted</i>

19:36.609 --> 19:39.744
or tapped on my testicles.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.712
And then on another occasion,

19:41.714 --> 19:44.749
<i>he held my testicles for
a significantly long time.</i>

19:44.751 --> 19:46.851
Guess what.
I just got engaged.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.520
Are you fucking kidding me?
Catherine's there, too?

19:49.522 --> 19:52.523
Hi, Jonah. Jason
proposed and I said yes.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.958
Well, shit, congratulations.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.594
- Marriage is good.
- It's a fine institution.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.830
Don't tell my mom.
I want to surprise her.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.500
Jonah, is there anything
else you want to tell us?

20:02.502 --> 20:04.769
I don't know. Is there
anybody else in the room?

20:04.771 --> 20:06.270
Just myself and Bill again.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.539
- And I'm here taking notes.
- <i>Sue's there?! Fuck!</i>

20:08.541 --> 20:10.908
Okay, well, no. There's nothing
else that I have to say.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.478
I'm pretty sure that I'm the only one
that Teddy's been touching, okay?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.414
- <i>Thanks, guys. Great talk.</i>
- ( phone beeps )

20:16.416 --> 20:19.283
Okay, we got nothing out
of that but a funny story.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.652
Gary: <i>Plane's broken.
We can't take off.</i>

20:21.654 --> 20:23.921
They said it's gonna be a week
until they get the part.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.556
Jesus Christ,
the Chinese can 3-D print

20:25.558 --> 20:26.991
- a hundred houses in that time.
- <i>Fuck!</i>

20:26.993 --> 20:29.360
Why isn't there a backup plane
for the backup plane, Mike?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.861
We need to get
on the press plane.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.330
The press hates us,
especially you.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.699
- They can't stand you.
- We have booze, Gary.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.235
And they have
a crippling dependency.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.903
- What, is this gonna work?
- In a dry country,

20:38.905 --> 20:42.406
the man with all the booze
holds the cards.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.708
- <i>( knock at door )</i>
- Yeah?

20:43.710 --> 20:46.277
Ma'am, you actually
do have a phone call.

20:46.279 --> 20:49.380
- <i>Oh.</i>
- It's Kent and Bill on speaker.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.615
Hey, guys, what's up?

20:50.617 --> 20:53.417
Ma'am, we're worried that Doyle
knows about the polling.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.986
- What polling?
- Kent.

20:54.988 --> 20:58.522
I thought it might be useful to see
how Doyle is performing as veep.

20:58.524 --> 21:02.793
I specifically promised Doyle
that I would not do that, Kent.

21:02.795 --> 21:06.364
I apologize. But it did throw up
some very interesting results.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.900
But I will run those by you
at a less angry time.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.670
We have what we think is a
very smart plan of action.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.372
- It's brilliant.
- Quite brilliant.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.740
We tell Doyle that your campaign

21:15.742 --> 21:18.409
used stolen data
to target bereaved parents.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.612
Why in the name
of pixelated fuck

21:21.614 --> 21:22.913
would you do that?
My God!

21:22.915 --> 21:25.916
And can you please use code
when we're talking about this?

21:25.918 --> 21:29.720
Use the word, I don't know,
cupcake instead of data

21:29.722 --> 21:33.791
<i>and use happy instead of
bereaved or something.</i>

21:33.793 --> 21:35.059
It binds him to us.
Infects him.

21:35.061 --> 21:38.863
And elements of his office were cc'd
on e-mails mentioning the breach.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.565
Exactly, he will be as
involved as the rest of us

21:41.567 --> 21:45.636
in targeting happy parents
after stealing cupcakes

21:45.638 --> 21:47.405
about their dead children.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.439
( scoffs )
Fine.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.509
Inject him with the happy
cupcake virus, all right?

21:51.511 --> 21:53.377
I hope he swells up and dies.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.780
That's not code, by the way.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.349
Wow. Ben, why don't I know
what's going on here?

21:58.351 --> 22:01.752
- I don't know. - I'm supposed
to have my finger on the button.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.554
But for all I know,
it's been rewired

22:03.556 --> 22:07.658
and I'm just operating some sort
of light in a closet somewhere.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.327
<i>And what are we gonna
do about Leon?</i>

22:09.329 --> 22:11.729
I'm gonna treat him like
my own brother, ahem,

22:11.731 --> 22:14.832
who I had murdered back in '86.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.868
The president is charming
the Middle East.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.838
But apparently her own VP
is unhappy with her?

22:20.840 --> 22:23.374
Not true.
And we're discussing rumors?

22:23.376 --> 22:24.842
Is this a news channel
or a dorm room?

22:24.844 --> 22:28.512
You could say that
the president's Iran visit

22:28.514 --> 22:33.017
puts a delicious glacé cherry on
the cake of Selina Meyer's tour.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.553
Well, welcome back
from the wasteland.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.456
Here's to us. To a job
well done on your part.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.891
- You were great.
- Yeah, I know.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.728
You know, we could
still be great.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.663
We could?

22:45.665 --> 22:47.665
Oh, yeah.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.801
- Can I ask you something?
- Uh-oh.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.404
Am I that transparent?
Really?

22:53.406 --> 22:56.474
Dan, you kind of are.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.975
Well, Amy,

22:57.977 --> 23:01.946
I would love it
if you would give me

23:01.948 --> 23:05.549
access to the White House.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.084
Oh.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.453
What?

23:09.455 --> 23:11.689
You think I was gonna
ask you something else?

23:11.691 --> 23:14.925
- No.
- Okay.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.528
( phone chimes )

23:17.530 --> 23:19.397
- Yeah?
- Sue: <i> Amy, bad news.</i>

23:19.399 --> 23:22.032
Ericsson told Doyle
that the campaign used

23:22.034 --> 23:24.802
dead kids' data to target
recently bereaved parents.

23:24.804 --> 23:28.105
God, that is some elaborate
self-sabotage right there.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.741
That is Cirque du Soleil
suicide bombing.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.445
Go back in time
and stop that from happening.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.046
You okay?

23:36.048 --> 23:37.915
I feel like I'm on
a life-support machine

23:37.917 --> 23:41.852
and they keep pulling the
plug to charge their phones.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.788
- Tequila?
- Yeah.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.090
- My God, this is so scary.
- Quiet down, Gary.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.725
- It's just really scary.
- Hurry up and be quiet...

23:47.727 --> 23:49.493
- ( gasps ) Oh, my God.
- Oh, you're kidding.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.128
- Jesus. Oh, my God.
- Pick them up!

23:51.130 --> 23:52.830
I don't want to go
to jail over here.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.966
We've got about 10 seconds
to drink everything

23:55.968 --> 23:57.768
and then eat the bottles.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.670
<i>( knocking )</i>

23:59.672 --> 24:01.572
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

24:01.574 --> 24:03.207
Oh, did I wake you up?

24:03.209 --> 24:04.708
Um, no.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.076
Come in.
Come in, come in.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.711
You don't look good, man.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.647
You look like
the cabin depressurized

24:09.649 --> 24:11.081
and you fell into
a coma or something.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.651
- No, I'm... I'm fine.
- Sit. Sit.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.986
( groans )
So...

24:15.988 --> 24:17.021
what's up, ma'am?

24:17.023 --> 24:18.889
I'm not in control, Ben.
I'm really not.

24:18.891 --> 24:22.226
- Well, we have pilots for that.
- <i>You know what I mean.</i>

24:22.228 --> 24:24.595
Leon, Kent's polling,

24:24.597 --> 24:26.096
dead kids baked in the cupcakes.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.899
<i>So all of this
has confirmed for me</i>

24:28.901 --> 24:30.468
that I made the right decision

24:30.470 --> 24:32.703
when I decided
to bring in somebody else.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.806
That's great.
More minds the merrier.

24:35.808 --> 24:36.874
That's a saying, I think.

24:36.876 --> 24:40.077
No, I don't think it is.
Her name is Karen Collins.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.813
Okay? You might remember her
from my old lawyering days.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.815
- No. -<i> I mean, seriously, Ben,</i>

24:44.817 --> 24:46.150
she's everything
that I'm missing.

24:46.152 --> 24:50.721
She's smart, she's
capable, she's organized.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.824
She sounds like the...

24:53.826 --> 24:54.925
complete package.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.661
Oh, no, no. But, I mean, you
know, don't misunderstand me.

24:57.663 --> 25:01.131
Because, I mean, obviously
I so respect you, Ben,

25:01.133 --> 25:04.268
and I think you're
incredibly capable.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.905
- And I also think that
you... -<i> ( snoring )</i>

25:10.776 --> 25:12.743
Ben?

25:13.513 --> 25:16.013
I need to see the president
for a debrief and a prebrief.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.816
Back off, Cary Grant, okay?
Vice president is first up.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.918
- No... - I need to tell my
mom that I got engaged.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.821
- Oh, also I got engaged.
- Yeah, so did I.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.990
To her.
That's obvious.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.925
Okay, congrats.
And... listen... listen up.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.794
The first thing that's gonna
happen once the president lands

25:30.796 --> 25:32.630
- is a debrief and then
we're... - ( chatter )

25:32.632 --> 25:35.099
Why does it feel like
nobody is listening to me?

25:35.101 --> 25:36.200
This is tough for you, huh?

25:36.202 --> 25:39.303
Looks like someone needs to
learn some management skills.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.804
I'm sorry, who the fuck are you?

25:40.806 --> 25:44.041
Oh, I'm Karen Collins, the
president's new senior advisor.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.243
My specialty...
Common sense.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.645
I need to talk to my mom.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.847
Oh, my God, Catherine,
look at you.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.715
Do you remember me?

25:51.717 --> 25:53.183
Of course.
Yeah.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.718
I really need to talk to my mom.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.121
Oh, let's handle it, then.
Dive in. Let's dive in.

25:57.123 --> 26:02.326
Um, so I obviously
knew about this Karen.

26:02.328 --> 26:03.661
Were you told?

26:03.663 --> 26:05.296
Senior advisor, yes.

26:05.298 --> 26:07.731
- Oh, sure. Of course. - Yeah.

26:07.733 --> 26:08.899
- Amy, hey.
- Yeah, what?

26:08.901 --> 26:14.238
Um, we have Leon West's mom,
and she just looks, um...

26:14.240 --> 26:15.673
just very terrible.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.809
I... talk to this...
Talk to Karen.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.878
Um, her specialty
is common sense.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.079
That's right.
Good memory.

26:22.081 --> 26:25.149
- I'm Jonah Ryan.
- Pleasure to meet you. I'm Karen.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.951
Sue, if anybody asks for me,

26:26.953 --> 26:30.688
I've gone outside
to scream into the night.

26:30.690 --> 26:31.922
Okay.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.223
Have one for me, too.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.259
Selina:
<i>Did you rest?</i>

26:35.261 --> 26:37.094
I slept like a drugged log.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.029
Good.
How do I look?

26:39.031 --> 26:40.164
Very tired.

26:40.166 --> 26:43.033
You know, Gary usually
sugarcoats that.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.301
Tired?

26:44.303 --> 26:46.370
God.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.639
Did my eye just twitch?

26:48.641 --> 26:50.741
No.

26:51.911 --> 26:54.912
Hey, Catherine, about earlier.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.715
- The molesting.
- What?

26:57.717 --> 26:58.983
Hmm?

26:58.985 --> 27:00.284
Wait, what?

27:00.286 --> 27:03.754
Hey, look, there's your mom.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.656
This isn't just about me.

27:05.658 --> 27:10.894
This is about the strength
of these two...

27:10.896 --> 27:13.230
beautiful people.

27:13.232 --> 27:18.636
I am most humbled to have
played my small part

27:18.638 --> 27:19.937
in human history.

27:19.939 --> 27:23.707
I'm not gonna make it
to the cottage, Wendy.

27:23.709 --> 27:24.642
I'm in Iran.

27:24.644 --> 27:28.946
Turns out you can't buy a boarding pass
with tiny bottles of Jack Daniels.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.681
- Ben: <i> Wow, that was great.</i>
- Wasn't it?

27:30.683 --> 27:33.417
- A lot of people need to talk to you.
- Okay, that's fine.

27:33.419 --> 27:34.818
- Mom.
- Catherine!

27:34.820 --> 27:37.121
- We're engaged.
- No, you're not.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.790
- Yes, we are.
- But we are.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.358
I'm 48.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.394
Put your hand down.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.896
- Amy: Well, it's nice to
have you back, ma'am. - Yeah.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.197
- And so...
- Selina: <i> Karen!</i>

27:47.199 --> 27:49.099
- I'm here.
- I'm gonna give you a hug.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.300
All right.
Great to see you.

27:50.302 --> 27:53.170
- I'm so glad to see you.
- ( both laugh )

27:53.172 --> 27:55.039
- You guys met?
- Yes.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.674
- Great. Great.
- Besties.

27:56.676 --> 27:57.908
Let's get off the tarmac.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.844
I'm not snacking.
I'm on my diet.

28:00.846 --> 28:04.214
It's a celery stick.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.416
All right, it's a cookie.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.418
I've had dates every day.

28:07.420 --> 28:10.854
You know dates are a dessert?
