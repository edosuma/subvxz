02:17.137 --> 02:21.432
When guys like you can't use your powers,
you become useless pieces of shit.

02:25.728 --> 02:26.729
You know it's pointless.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.899
As an ex-inmate of Supermax,
you should know that.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.154
Hey!

02:39.868 --> 02:41.327
Oh, I was just…

02:41.995 --> 02:44.706
Tell the pilot that I'll be riding along.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.250
I was returning to HQ anyway,
so it's perfect timing.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.002
Roger. Come aboard.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.504
No. I already have a place to sit.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.744
You sure do have bad luck,

03:22.827 --> 03:26.789
getting caught like that by a superhero
who happened to be vacationing in Florida.

03:27.415 --> 03:32.253
And he's the most powerful dude
in The Union of Justice, Gladiator.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.847
Oh, this must be the reception.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.058
I've reserved a Cessna.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.900
It's the Cessna at the very back.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.404
It's still early,
so wait here until the boss arrives.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.615
If you're free now,
why not ride with me in my Cessna?

04:42.699 --> 04:43.741
Hey!

04:43.825 --> 04:45.326
Something terrible has happened!

04:45.410 --> 04:46.911
The Cessna at the very back

04:46.995 --> 04:49.664
suddenly started
and someone got caught in the propeller!

04:49.747 --> 04:52.417
-They're all calling for you!
-What?

04:53.001 --> 04:56.254
The engine started?
That's impossible! How could that happen?

05:00.550 --> 05:02.427
-How did this happen?
-This guy's fucked up.

05:03.845 --> 05:07.515
For god's sake! I was just about
to hit it off with her too.

05:07.598 --> 05:10.018
Didn't look that way to me.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.730
It's my style
to warm up those icy cold types.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.315
Oh, gramps…

05:19.527 --> 05:21.946
Hello, sexy baby.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.575
Thank you.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.202
You're making me blush.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.291
This guy was the only one on the plane.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.918
Okay, move him outside.

05:39.797 --> 05:40.840
Quit movin' around!

05:40.923 --> 05:44.177
I can't help it
until I grow my parts back!

05:45.136 --> 05:46.512
Hey there!

05:46.596 --> 05:47.597
There!

05:50.433 --> 05:52.060
Mission commenced!

05:52.643 --> 05:54.812
Is electric boy's work done?

05:54.896 --> 05:56.314
No, it ain't.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.067
Yeah! Charge my phone for me, would ya?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.446
I like that!

06:03.529 --> 06:05.198
Thunder fuck you!

06:06.699 --> 06:08.159
Yo!

06:10.286 --> 06:13.998
My arm!

06:18.002 --> 06:20.296
It's grown back.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.173
I'm gonna puke.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.301
That's how beautiful life works, man!

06:35.436 --> 06:38.481
Nice! Being in the cockpit sure is fine!

06:38.564 --> 06:41.484
You're cleared for takeoff
from runway nine.

06:42.026 --> 06:45.279
Cleared for takeoff
from runway nine. Copy.

06:48.449 --> 06:52.411
Don't be nervous, boy. Just follow
my directions and all will go well.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.914
Nervous? Not in the least.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.458
No matter how long
a pilot has been flying,

06:57.542 --> 07:01.838
there are times where you'll lose track
of where the sky and the land are.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.214
To keep that from happening,

07:03.297 --> 07:07.051
I always calmly observe everything
and check the instruments.

07:07.718 --> 07:08.594
Oh, really?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.055
That's my style.

07:11.722 --> 07:12.557
Here.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.394
That's the wiring plan
for the other airplane. Study it well.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.354
Yeah.

07:20.231 --> 07:23.734
Don't compare your powers
with other people's powers, Johnny.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.447
What's important is
to find your own style.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.532
Don't you worry, Carmine.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.910
I was born with nothing but style.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.412
Carmine?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.831
I am The Heat.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.918
Welcome aboard, Super Crooks!

07:41.586 --> 07:46.048
You good-for-nothing scum!
Don't you dare fasten those seatbelts!

07:46.132 --> 07:48.134
-All right!
-All right!

07:59.687 --> 08:01.898
Kasey, we've just taken off.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.499
Static electricity?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.670
Looks like this will be a smooth flight.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.838
We'll see.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.257
A bird just might
smash into the windshield.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.177
There was an accident like that once.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.845
Roger! Watching out for birds.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.812
We're within range.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.482
Can you deactivate
the restraint device TK's in?

08:44.565 --> 08:48.319
No can do. The device itself
renders all powers useless.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.364
Roger. Okay, you bums,
we're going with plan B.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.365
Roger!

08:52.949 --> 08:54.075
Plan B. Okay!

08:55.576 --> 08:57.245
They're way too relaxed about this.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.832
Four hours until arrival at Supermax.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.793
We're conveying one supervillain.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.294
Provide security on landing.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.966
Supermax. Security on landing. Copy.
What is the supervillain's numb…

09:10.925 --> 09:12.218
What?

09:14.512 --> 09:15.846
What happened?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.308
Talking time is over!

09:20.017 --> 09:22.311
Gramps, I've shut down
their communications.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.441
Boys, time to get this party started!

09:30.611 --> 09:33.030
Don't you guys have villain suits?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.574
What? A suit?

09:34.657 --> 09:37.285
Even a million of those
wouldn't be enough!

09:37.368 --> 09:39.537
They'll see your face
if you don't have a mask.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.331
Don't you like my face, pal?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.501
Josh, have you ever thought about
how it feels to be a person with a face

09:45.585 --> 09:48.170
that no amount
of plastic surgery can change?

09:54.552 --> 09:57.221
When we're on a mission,
my name's The Ghost.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.932
I don't want to be around you anyway!

10:00.808 --> 10:03.811
I hate your guts, Ghost!

10:27.668 --> 10:29.253
Hello there!

10:53.361 --> 10:56.030
Ghost! I got rid of the troublemaker!

11:17.343 --> 11:18.344
What?

11:19.428 --> 11:20.554
It's a ghost.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.604
Sammy, see you in heaven.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.625
You're pretty good at hiding.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.253
Who the heck are you?

12:13.941 --> 12:15.192
Dammit!

12:15.276 --> 12:18.571
That's some brutal treatment
for someone you've just met.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.948
I'm actually quite shy, you know.

12:22.032 --> 12:25.744
Your kind of power
is the kind I hate most of all!

12:52.938 --> 12:55.274
TK, right? I'm with The Heat.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.862
Communication is out!

13:00.362 --> 13:01.906
It's gotten quiet in the back.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.450
You think they all got taken out?

13:07.369 --> 13:08.871
You guys don't have guns, right?

13:15.794 --> 13:17.671
You think Gladiator got taken out too?

13:18.339 --> 13:19.298
I don't know.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.675
If he's all right,
he should be able to save us.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.762
Hitting a bird
is the least of our worries.

13:34.063 --> 13:34.897
Hurry!

13:35.397 --> 13:37.066
Let's get as close as we can to Supermax.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.484
Yes, sir!

13:40.903 --> 13:43.822
They're speeding up.
Can you slow them down, Johnny?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.200
That's a silly question.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.330
Damn!

13:51.413 --> 13:53.707
For some reason, it's not speeding up!

13:53.791 --> 13:54.667
You're kidding!

13:56.752 --> 13:59.797
We're done for! They'll take us out too!

14:01.549 --> 14:03.050
Hurry it up, boys!

14:03.133 --> 14:05.344
Johnny can't keep this up forever.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.681
This is a piece of cake, gramps.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.058
I'll show you what my style is like.

14:32.454 --> 14:36.166
Scum like you with nothing
but your powers are a plague on society!

14:36.250 --> 14:37.960
That sure is mean.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.671
How dare you
judge someone just by their looks?

14:45.009 --> 14:46.927
Roddy! How are things on your end?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.181
Ghost, hurry up and free TK!

14:51.265 --> 14:53.392
How can he without the code?

14:53.475 --> 14:56.020
The Ghost is a notorious safecracker.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.856
If anyone
can deactivate that lock, Josh can.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.443
You'll never deactivate it.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.861
Give it up.

15:03.944 --> 15:08.115
Once we arrive
at Supermax, you're through!

15:17.791 --> 15:20.085
Not more bad luck!

15:20.169 --> 15:21.962
No, this is good luck.

15:22.046 --> 15:22.880
What?

15:44.693 --> 15:48.739
The problem with you villains
is how you use your powers.

15:49.323 --> 15:53.661
Scum like you who resort to easy crimes
without making any effort or determination

15:53.744 --> 15:55.704
don't deserve to breathe
the air of this world!

16:07.800 --> 16:09.301
That got in my mouth!

16:31.240 --> 16:33.492
I'll crush your skull.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.525
Don't think you've won!

17:06.608 --> 17:08.193
Even if I fall from this height,
I won't die!

17:10.112 --> 17:14.825
All you ever do is talk about yourself.
I bet you've got no friends!

17:15.492 --> 17:17.786
I've got lots of friends!

17:43.854 --> 17:47.399
At last! He's here!
Mommy! Daddy! It's a hero!

17:47.483 --> 17:49.234
My goodness! How wonderful!

17:49.318 --> 17:51.361
At last, this day has arrived!

17:51.445 --> 17:52.738
Everyone!

17:53.947 --> 17:57.743
Oh, great Gladiator,
won't you please save our kingdom?

17:58.452 --> 18:00.829
Ever since that day

18:00.913 --> 18:03.332
Everything

18:03.415 --> 18:07.878
Changed

18:08.587 --> 18:12.883
To our ocean, darkness--

18:12.966 --> 18:14.134
Enough!

18:31.193 --> 18:32.402
Fine.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.448
I'll save your kingdom. Take me there.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.710
It will be a difficult fight.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.920
Are you prepared for it?

18:50.587 --> 18:52.548
I've trained for this a long time!

19:12.651 --> 19:15.112
Roddy! Get me one of those beers!

19:16.655 --> 19:17.489
Where's the hero?

19:23.245 --> 19:26.248
That overly self-conscious defender
of justice idiot got what he deserves!

19:26.832 --> 19:29.501
Kasey, what kind of dream is he having?

19:29.585 --> 19:32.212
He's dreaming of becoming
the hero of a mermaid kingdom.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.757
Heat, everything here is going fine.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.178
Heat?

19:45.475 --> 19:46.560
We're almost there!

19:46.643 --> 19:47.769
Dear God!

19:50.898 --> 19:52.399
Ghost! Hurry it up!

19:56.486 --> 19:57.529
Hey!

19:58.071 --> 19:58.906
What?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.657
Tell me the deactivation code!

20:00.741 --> 20:02.743
No way!

20:05.537 --> 20:07.873
It's no good! I can't deactivate it!

20:07.956 --> 20:10.667
The guards won't tell me either.
Why would they?

20:10.751 --> 20:14.588
When we get to Supermax, you're through.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.299
Heat! We've failed!

20:17.382 --> 20:20.385
We can't fly this thing
and if we'll get caught anyway,

20:20.469 --> 20:22.221
let's not hurt these guys anymore so--

20:22.304 --> 20:23.805
Then go to plan C!

20:27.851 --> 20:29.102
Plan C?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.357
There's no plan C!

20:36.360 --> 20:37.778
Hey!

20:37.861 --> 20:39.238
Get closer!

20:39.321 --> 20:41.031
What? What are you doing?

20:41.531 --> 20:43.158
This is plan C!

20:43.242 --> 20:46.119
Don't do it, Johnny!
We'll crash into them!

22:38.273 --> 22:43.278
