WEBVTT

00:17.784 --> 00:19.651
(chuckles)
How do I look? What
do you guys think?

00:19.653 --> 00:21.320
Not bad, Winston.
I'll tell you what, man.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.654
You look like the funny guy
from<i> Police Academy</i>

00:22.656 --> 00:24.523
who does the-the voices,

00:24.525 --> 00:26.025
and different sounds.
(imitates radio beeping
and siren wailing)

00:26.027 --> 00:27.860
God, I wish marketers
had a uniform.

00:27.862 --> 00:29.128
(construction clatter
begins outside)
To Winston Bishop,

00:29.130 --> 00:30.329
owner of cats,

00:30.331 --> 00:32.464
taker of baths,
graduate of the LAPD.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.999
We are so...

00:34.001 --> 00:35.667
(workman shouts, clatter
and banging continue outside)

00:35.669 --> 00:37.870
I'm so proud of you!

00:37.872 --> 00:39.671
What?
I'm so proud of you.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.006
You're proud of me?
- Oh!

00:41.008 --> 00:43.976
When is this night
construction gonna stop?

00:43.978 --> 00:45.210
I actually don't mind it.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.512
Gets me ready
for all the loud action

00:46.514 --> 00:47.679
on the job,
you know what I mean?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.481
Something has got to change.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.717
(mechanical whirring)

00:55.321 --> 00:56.588
(whirring stops)

00:59.559 --> 01:01.427
(whirring resumes)

01:05.565 --> 01:07.833
Well, don't worry, 'cause
I have called the city's

01:07.835 --> 01:10.169
automated help desk
and I've also sent out an e-mail

01:10.171 --> 01:13.539
to information@losangeles.gov,
so action has been taken.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.374
Jess, don't you know
how democracy works?

01:15.376 --> 01:17.576
We need to get out there and
grease palms, blackmail people.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.012
We need to send them an envelope
filled with fake blood

01:20.014 --> 01:22.347
and-and a note that says...

01:22.349 --> 01:24.850
"I know."
- What?
- (Winston clears throat)

01:24.852 --> 01:27.419
As if... as if we know
what's really going on.
Schmidt, you do

01:27.421 --> 01:29.521
realize you're saying this
in front of a police officer.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.856
I'm so sorry.
A little respect.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.024
Can I try on your uniform?

01:32.026 --> 01:33.358
No. This uniform is

01:33.360 --> 01:35.961
for official police business.

01:38.531 --> 01:39.531
(whoops)
- (laughs)

01:39.533 --> 01:40.866
Looking good, man.
- Yeah.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.534
We got a code Jewish,
code Jewish.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.036
You're under "ch'arrest."

01:44.038 --> 01:46.071
I can't believe
Winston's gonna be a cop.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.707
I mean, he's the gentlest
person I know.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.042
He once broke his arm
wrapping presents.

01:50.044 --> 01:52.111
Remember when
he made this?

01:52.113 --> 01:53.612
He's the sweetest guy
in the world, man.

01:53.614 --> 01:57.449
He's just so nice
and... vulnerable.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.283
Yeah.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.385
Although...

02:00.387 --> 02:02.054
don't know what this is for.

02:02.056 --> 02:03.956
WINSTON: Hey.
What are you guys doing?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.091
Uh, n-nothing, man.

02:06.093 --> 02:07.092
Look, I'm a little

02:07.094 --> 02:08.727
worried about you, okay?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.262
And so is Coach.
(chuckles)

02:10.264 --> 02:11.296
Kind of worried about you, man.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.298
Guys, calm down.
I understand,

02:13.300 --> 02:15.400
I get it, and I'm...
and I'm flattered that you're

02:15.402 --> 02:17.402
concerned about me, but
I signed up for this, remember?

02:17.404 --> 02:19.238
Also, my training officer
is gonna be with me

02:19.240 --> 02:20.639
the entire time.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.274
He's got a partner.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.442
I forgot about the partner.
That's huge.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.810
We're silly. Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.112
It's supposed to be
a real bad-ass, too.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.781
Was in a biker gang
for three years, undercover.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.950
Can't go back
to Arizona no more.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.486
Is that<i> True Detective?</i>
Apparently eats bullets
as a party trick.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.655
Great, that's really good.
That makes sense,
what are you, uh...

02:36.657 --> 02:39.091
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
What's that?

02:39.093 --> 02:40.926
What the...?
- WINSTON: Uh...

02:40.928 --> 02:42.427
which... Oh, that?

02:42.429 --> 02:45.664
It's a, uh...
it's a project.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.100
I've had a report of people

02:48.102 --> 02:49.668
acting lame back here.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.836
SCHMIDT:
Ow, Jess!

02:50.838 --> 02:52.771
Also, I tazed Schmidt.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.606
WINSTON:
All right, seriously,

02:54.608 --> 02:56.275
no more playing
with the uniform.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.444
Officer Leslie Biggins.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.280
Okay, Biggins. So Bishop's
gonna be next, okay? Come on.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.447
All right, here we go.

03:02.449 --> 03:03.949
Officer Hank Bishop.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.517
Eh...
- Oh, that one.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.021
Officer Win...

03:09.023 --> 03:10.856
...field Bishop.
- Ooh.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.692
Well that's gonna cause a lot of
mix-ups over at the station.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.527
Officer Winston Bishop.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.262
(loud cheering, whooping)

03:20.466 --> 03:23.035
Winston!
ALL (chanting):
Winston! Winston!

03:23.037 --> 03:25.337
Winston! Winston! Winston!

03:25.339 --> 03:27.339
Winston! Winston!
COACH: Yes!

03:27.341 --> 03:29.041
Winnie!
- (horn blares loudly)

03:30.677 --> 03:32.211
(groans)
- Sorry.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.319
Wow, a lot of city
officials around here.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.688
Maybe somebody can help us
with our noise problem.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.822
Okay, enough of this
by-the-book nonsense.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.157
It's time to play hardball.

03:45.159 --> 03:47.025
Be a shark, Jess. Not a dolphin.
Right.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.727
So I shouldn't be the
smartest and friendliest

03:48.729 --> 03:51.363
creature in the ocean?
That makes sense, bro.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.031
Sharks eat whatever they want.
Dolphins-- they jump

03:53.033 --> 03:54.833
through hoops, so, yeah,
I think it does make sense.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.001
No, it's awesome, bro.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.736
Okay, stop mockingly
saying "bro."

03:57.738 --> 03:59.571
My uncle was arrested for
having sex with a dolphin.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.806
What?
- What?

04:02.542 --> 04:04.209
Carry on.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.411
I'm having a lot of difficulty
nailing you down, Ryan.

04:06.413 --> 04:10.182
Oh, there's councilwoman
Fawn Moscato.

04:10.184 --> 04:11.516
She's from our district.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.518
Yummo.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.520
Where do I place my ballot?
She better get ready,

04:15.522 --> 04:18.257
'cause she's about to have a
very friendly conversation

04:18.259 --> 04:21.059
with a concerned
citizen... bro.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.262
Okay, Jess, it's not
gonna do anything.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.030
Won't make a difference.
Like what I did there

04:25.032 --> 04:26.865
with the ballot thing?
It was a good joke, right?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.367
Didn't get
the reaction I thought

04:28.369 --> 04:29.935
it was gonna get from you guys.
No, we got it.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.770
We got it, bro.
- Oh, I get it.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.605
You know what,
I've seen the Bollywood movies,

04:33.607 --> 04:34.940
I've seen the UK<i> Office.</i>

04:34.942 --> 04:36.908
Not a fan, not a fan.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.277
Congratulations.
These are from all of us,

04:38.279 --> 04:39.878
but I'm the one
that got them for you.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.380
Wow, they're big.
- So, Winnie,

04:41.382 --> 04:42.881
where's your
bad-ass training officer?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.217
Oh, guys, I would like
for you to meet the person

04:45.219 --> 04:47.619
who will be training me
as I brave the mean

04:47.621 --> 04:49.921
streets of L.A.:
Officer Aly Nelson.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.256
She's so small.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.058
What?
- Excuse me?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.426
You're so small, you're...

04:54.428 --> 04:55.627
What is happening, Bishop?
I think what he was

04:55.629 --> 04:57.629
trying to say was that, um...
Yeah?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.464
We were expecting
someone who looks

04:59.466 --> 05:01.433
a little more like a cop
in the traditional sense.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.801
That's what I meant.
No, no, no.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.269
Wow.
- I'm not trying to

05:04.271 --> 05:06.238
offend you, we were just
expecting, like, uh,

05:06.240 --> 05:08.073
either a really strong man
or kind of like a guy

05:08.075 --> 05:08.974
with, like, a mustache.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.442
Got it. And flowers are a...

05:10.444 --> 05:12.811
that's a normal thing
to give to a grown man?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.579
Or are they trees?

05:14.581 --> 05:16.748
I can't tell, I'm so small.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.917
Cool friends, Bishop.
No, wait.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.252
Officer Nelson, just...

05:20.254 --> 05:22.921
Thank you.
Thank you very much, you guys.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.424
Oh, also, thank you
for the flowers.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.794
And just so we're clear, the
first thank you was sarcastic,

05:28.796 --> 05:32.130
because you embarrassed me,
but the second thank you

05:32.132 --> 05:35.434
was sincere as hell, because
these flowers are glorious!

05:35.436 --> 05:37.302
You're welcome.

05:37.304 --> 05:38.437
I'm sorry about
the construction noise.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.805
It's an issue
close to my heart.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.507
I do charity work
with deaf children.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.775
Of course, they would
welcome the noise,

05:43.777 --> 05:45.644
because it would mean
they could hear.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.113
Let me let you in
on a little secret.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.782
Just go to the
public works Web site

05:50.784 --> 05:53.452
and download this form.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.854
You're a dear, Fawn.
(laughs)

05:55.856 --> 05:58.357
I made a pun and
I didn't know it.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.624
You're too much.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.026
Oh.
- Hi.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.527
JESS:
Schmidt,

06:02.529 --> 06:03.862
this is Fawn Moscato.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.797
She was just giving me
a shortcut to file

06:05.799 --> 06:08.333
some complaints
about the noise.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.868
(whispers): Looks like
someone brought a shark

06:09.870 --> 06:11.670
to the dolphin show.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.139
(squeaks)

06:14.141 --> 06:15.807
That's a dolphin noise.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.342
Ah. Very good.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.344
Councilwoman Moscato,
excuse my trembling,

06:19.346 --> 06:20.645
but it's an honor.

06:20.647 --> 06:23.048
Your head is enormous.
Why, thank you.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.516
JESS:
<i>So you're taking her</i>

06:24.518 --> 06:26.551
out to dinner? That's your plan?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.687
I'm intoxicating a single,
overworked public official

06:28.689 --> 06:30.322
with the pleasure
of my company.

06:30.324 --> 06:31.656
Which I will then parlay

06:31.658 --> 06:33.725
into getting her
to fix our problem.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.727
Are my sleeves even?
This is ridiculous.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.829
You know, my new tailor
sews like an army medic.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.998
I'm not being overdramatic
when I say that I would rather

06:40.000 --> 06:41.833
sit naked on a hot grill

06:41.835 --> 06:43.335
than wear something
off the rack.

06:43.337 --> 06:45.070
Schmidt, just don't
screw this up.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.738
She's a decent woman.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.340
Oh, excuse me.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.409
At some point in the evening,
can you let me know

06:50.411 --> 06:52.511
that I have a call
from Karl Lagerfeld?

06:52.513 --> 06:54.079
Schmidt.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.580
Bob, how are you?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.382
Tony, love you in a chino.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.418
Guillermo, fire up that grill.
Fawn's hungry.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.652
GUILLERMO:
<i>Sí, señora.</i>

07:01.521 --> 07:03.522
I'm Fawn Moscato.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.424
And I approve this scotch.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.459
Oh, goodness.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.565
Okay, so I'm almost finished
with form 7D42,

07:13.567 --> 07:16.668
but I'm not sure what to put
down for landlord's birth city.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.770
Hey.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.439
Ooh. What you doing, hot shot?

07:20.441 --> 07:23.708
I was feeling saucy.
I've had a glass of red wine.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.444
Red wine makes you
bonkers horny.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.711
I'll make you a deal.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.213
When I finish a form,

07:28.215 --> 07:30.549
you can take off an article
of clothing, and that way,

07:30.551 --> 07:33.218
when I'm done, then we can
just go nuts on each other.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.420
Deal.
- Hey, I'm not
finished yet.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.388
(sighs)

07:36.390 --> 07:37.923
Oh!

07:37.925 --> 07:40.225
This is America! Wear pants!
JESS:
Red wine. Sorry!

07:40.227 --> 07:43.061
Sorry. Sorry.<i> Very</i> sorry.
Sorry. Sorry. Geez. Yeah.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.729
COACH: So, tomorrow's
your first shift, huh?

07:44.731 --> 07:46.465
You gonna play
the name game,

07:46.467 --> 07:48.767
do something fun
and safe like that?
(phone chimes)

07:48.769 --> 07:51.303
Dude, I'm gonna be
in a patrol car the entire time.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.938
(laughs)

07:52.940 --> 07:55.240
I just got a text
from my buddy Reynolds.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.608
Working his first shift,

07:56.610 --> 07:58.910
he got stabbed in the
leg by a little girl.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.245
(laughs)

08:00.247 --> 08:02.481
I love Reynolds, man.
He makes me laugh.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.149
That's funny.
- You think
that's funny?

08:04.151 --> 08:06.485
To be stabbed by
a little kid, yeah.
On the job.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.487
Right. 'Cause you get paid.
That you're about to do.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.822
Right, 'cause it's a child,
and it's hilarious.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.123
You don't like
getting cut.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.658
You're very
physically sensitive.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.961
I am. Paper cuts
give me headaches.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.596
I can't wait
to meet him.
- Yeah.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.663
Maybe he'll stab me.
Guys, chill out, okay?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.465
I told you, I got my partner

08:20.467 --> 08:22.267
to protect me, remember?
The little one?

08:22.269 --> 08:24.169
The one would could take a nap
in a match box?

08:24.171 --> 08:26.671
Which reminds me-- I'm gonna
make her a sandwich tomorrow.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.440
I might even throw in
a crossword puzzle

08:28.442 --> 08:30.108
with Winston-related clues

08:30.110 --> 08:31.443
so she can get
to know me better.

08:31.445 --> 08:34.012
"Who likes cats?"
Winston, across.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.451
I don't like this.
- Mm-mm.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.620
His training officer
can't protect him!
- She's too tiny.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.121
She looks like
she won the silver medal

08:43.123 --> 08:44.656
in Athens for the balance beam.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.124
Girl could drown in a raindrop.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.526
I mean, that's girl's...

08:47.528 --> 08:49.628
I mean, she...

08:49.630 --> 08:51.630
I can't think of one 'cause
I'm so worried about Winston!

08:51.632 --> 08:53.865
I'm worried about him, too,
but I can still think of 'em.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.635
Uh, girl's so, uh... Ugh!

08:56.637 --> 08:58.136
She looks like
a Persian Webster.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.804
Ah...

08:59.806 --> 09:02.541
Girl's like a pepperoni.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.643
Why are you here?

09:04.645 --> 09:05.877
We brought you a gift.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.146
Assorted candies.
Please enjoy.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.814
They are delicious.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.816
Now, I'm sure you have
friends and family of officers

09:11.818 --> 09:14.019
coming in here all the
time to check on them.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.820
No. No, this would be a first.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.389
Really? This is the first?
What do you guys need?

09:17.391 --> 09:18.990
Well, we are here because, uh,

09:18.992 --> 09:21.226
Winston is our best friend,
as you know, and, um...

09:21.228 --> 09:22.994
(clears throat)
...we're worried about him.
Yeah.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.329
And I'm not saying
that you're bad

09:24.331 --> 09:25.897
at your job
as a training officer.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.033
But I'm not saying
you're good at your job.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.069
And that's why we're here-- to
kind of see where you're at,

09:31.071 --> 09:32.370
to see if you're ready

09:32.372 --> 09:34.239
to protect our asset,
our dear friend.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.874
Let's-let's be diplomatic.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.510
Did Bishop put you up to this?
Does he have some sort of

09:38.512 --> 09:40.845
problem with me being
his training officer?
Not at all.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.681
Oh, he is going to pay for this.
He is going to pay.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.848
He shouldn't pay for this.
This has nothing
to do with him.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.584
This is about us.
- Okay.

09:45.586 --> 09:46.918
First of all, you shouldn't
get mad at him. Get mad at us.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.520
Get out!
It's good to see you.

09:48.522 --> 09:51.656
Get out.
- Okay.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.863
Yo. Ry-guy.
(chuckles)

09:58.865 --> 10:00.065
I finished
printing out the forms.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.700
Let's get goofy.
- Mm.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.935
Come on!
- Aah. Mm-mm.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.370
You got a real
Dudley Moore thing

10:05.372 --> 10:08.039
going on right now,
and I like it.
- (groans)

10:08.041 --> 10:10.875
Jessica Day,
I think I'm in love.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.577
Sorry. Did you just say
you were in love?

10:12.579 --> 10:14.279
That woman is a dynamo.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.881
So let's talk about the whole
construction noise thing.

10:16.883 --> 10:21.052
Has anyone ever told you you
look like a Jewish Kennedy?

10:21.054 --> 10:23.955
I hope not, because
that would be offensive.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.459
(laughs)

10:27.461 --> 10:29.294
What? I thought you were
supposed to be some kind

10:29.296 --> 10:30.962
of big shark,
and you were playing her.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.964
About the noise.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.933
Given the many considerations--
traffic, budget...

10:34.935 --> 10:36.801
Okay, what is happening?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.403
What are you doing
with your thumb?

10:38.405 --> 10:40.972
We feel it best to proceed
with the given strategy.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.741
She played<i> you!</i>

10:42.743 --> 10:44.442
I know, and it was
wildly arousing!

10:44.444 --> 10:46.311
But let me tell you
something, Jess.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.646
She played you, too.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.280
No, she didn't.
No, she didn't.
- Mm-hmm.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.082
I filled out the form,
I submitted it.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.651
Here's the confirmation,
right here.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.285
"Thank you for your inquiry.

10:54.287 --> 10:57.989
We will respond
in 360 to 500 days"!
Isn't she great?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.091
She can't just walk all over
the people of the city

11:00.093 --> 11:01.426
like the Jolly Green Giant.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.994
Jolly Green Giant...

11:02.996 --> 11:04.596
He doesn't stomp on people.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.498
He encourages them to
eat their vegetables.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.134
You can't let her do this!
We have to keep fighting!

11:09.136 --> 11:11.002
She's taking me to a
ribbon-cutting ceremony

11:11.004 --> 11:12.437
at a<i> carniceria</i> tomorrow.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.005
You know, Jess, I really think

11:14.007 --> 11:16.641
that she may be grooming
me to be her arm candy.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.677
This could be a real Bill
and Hillary situation.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.179
You, sir, are no Bill Clinton.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.614
I know. I'm Hillary.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.149
Well, you're not Hillary,
either!

11:24.151 --> 11:25.617
I am, too, Hillary!

11:25.619 --> 11:28.319
Hey, man, can you be
the one to walk away?

11:28.321 --> 11:30.021
'Cause I just, like...

11:30.023 --> 11:32.457
My little sleeping British
bulldog here is gonna wake up,

11:32.459 --> 11:34.459
and he's gonna get
scared if I'm not there.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.227
Yeah, I got you.
- Yeah.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.499
JESS: A bunch of neighbors
have joined the fight.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.802
See, if you put out
an honest message,

11:43.804 --> 11:45.970
you get good, honest people
to help you.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.639
Per municipal code 2B,

11:47.641 --> 11:49.808
construction is prohibited
at night.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.510
However, this project's
been issued a waiver

11:52.512 --> 11:54.312
that we are trying
to revoke.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.214
Now, I'm going to mash a muffin
into the phone.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.651
You tell me
if it makes its way through.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.486
You're doing
a great job, Dave.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.655
It's important
to keep it positive.

12:03.657 --> 12:06.658
So, what happened
to Schmidt?
- I don't need him.
I got this on lockdown.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.893
Yes, it is banana-walnut.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.662
Now I'm gonna tell you the story

12:10.664 --> 12:12.731
of how my daddy spawned
with a pony

12:12.733 --> 12:15.667
and made the mud boy--
that's me.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.269
"Chapter One--
Mama's House."

12:19.872 --> 12:21.673
Make sure they're sharp.

12:21.675 --> 12:24.008
It's political suicide to not
cut the ribbon on the first try.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.577
Of course.
Look, if there's anyone

12:25.579 --> 12:27.212
who understands the
importance of a sharp knife,

12:27.214 --> 12:29.347
it's a Jewish man.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.349
Hey, listen, about the
construction issue...
We've discussed that.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.685
Look, changing that schedule's
a logistical nightmare,

12:33.687 --> 12:35.553
not to mention the people
it'll piss off.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.223
The sewage lobby's involved
in that project, and trust me,

12:38.225 --> 12:39.724
you don't want to cross them.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.526
Did they shoot poopy everywhere?

12:41.528 --> 12:44.696
How old are you?
No. No, they just...

12:44.698 --> 12:46.197
They contribute money
to my opponent.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.699
Of course. No, I-I knew that.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.534
They... Why would they shoot
poopy everywhere?

12:49.536 --> 12:50.702
Got it.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.370
Hey, listen, I wanted
to warn you.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.272
My roommates have recruited
a gang of derelicts

12:54.274 --> 12:57.375
to-to protest the
council meeting.

12:57.377 --> 13:01.212
If only there was someone
who could oppose them.

13:01.214 --> 13:04.716
Of course, I can't, because it's
technically a citizens' forum.

13:04.718 --> 13:07.886
Are you saying that I should?
I'm not saying anything.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.721
Okay.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.456
You're trying
to manipulate me again.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.559
You must think
that I'm a real shmendrick.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.227
Well, I love it.
When we're in public,

13:16.229 --> 13:18.062
Yeah.
- let's just tone down
the Jewish thing, okay?

13:18.064 --> 13:19.731
Let's tone down
the Jewish thing.
- Yeah.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.733
I can do that. 100%.
Let's tone down the Jewish...

13:21.735 --> 13:23.401
Hey, by the way, sir,

13:23.403 --> 13:25.570
thank you so much for keeping
the councilwoman safe.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.739
MAN:
Five stars for Arman!
He's an Uber driver.

13:27.741 --> 13:30.542
I'm a councilwoman,
not a senator.
Okay, I felt like that...

13:31.577 --> 13:32.811
(gags)

13:32.813 --> 13:35.146
(coughing)

13:36.148 --> 13:37.816
First day on the job.
Is this where

13:37.818 --> 13:40.084
you tell me to forget everything
I learned in training?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.419
N-No!

13:41.421 --> 13:43.154
Remember<i> everything.</i>

13:43.156 --> 13:44.455
Bishop, if you have a problem

13:44.457 --> 13:45.924
with me being
your training officer,

13:45.926 --> 13:47.425
put down your ice cream cone,

13:47.427 --> 13:49.093
take your frickin' thumbs
out of your mouth,

13:49.095 --> 13:50.495
and say it to my face!

13:50.497 --> 13:51.763
What?! I don't have
a problem with you.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.431
Did you or did you not

13:53.433 --> 13:54.833
tell your roommates
to come check up on me?

13:54.835 --> 13:57.268
What?! They did that?
- Yeah.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.471
Oh, my goodness,
I am so "furiated" right now!

14:00.473 --> 14:03.474
I am very lucky to have you
as my training officer.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.109
My roommates
don't speak for me.

14:05.111 --> 14:08.279
I promise you will never
have to see them again.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.215
They're right there.
They're literally right there.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.620
Oh, yeah, yeah,
they see.
- They got us.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.288
Hey.
- Yeah. Hey.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.990
(sighs)

14:18.992 --> 14:22.527
When you step to the badge,
the badge step back.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.331
Don't<i> ever</i> say that
in my car again.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.966
What the hell are
you two doing here?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.634
And why are you talking
to Aly behind my back?

14:29.636 --> 14:32.537
She said that you guys gave
her weird unwrapped candy

14:32.539 --> 14:34.973
and then you stole toilet paper
from the station bathroom.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.374
We need that
toilet paper.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.542
Because we're worried
about you!

14:37.544 --> 14:39.344
We're trying
to protect you.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.646
What?
- She's so small, Winston.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.348
You guys should
have faith in me.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.650
I got a badge, I got a diploma,
and I got a special

14:45.652 --> 14:47.318
plastic thing that goes
over my hat for when it rains.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.487
DISPATCHER: We got a 339
in progress at 62 Sage Brush.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.155
That sounds dangerous. Stop him!
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

14:51.157 --> 14:53.491
We can't let you do this!
We're trying to protect you!

14:53.493 --> 14:55.693
What the hell is your problem?
This is scary! We're not letting
you go on the street!

14:55.695 --> 14:58.830
This an obstruction of justice.
That is an obstruction of...
You won't die on my watch!

14:58.832 --> 15:02.233
Hey! Hey, Nick. Nick.
Oh! I can't give you these
'cause I care about you.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.902
Nick, give me the keys.
Don't give 'em back!

15:03.904 --> 15:05.503
We love you, man!
We love you!

15:05.505 --> 15:06.838
WINSTON: Coach, you know
I can't jump that high!

15:06.840 --> 15:08.072
Don't test me.
COACH: We're protecting you.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.041
Give me those
damn keys right...

15:10.043 --> 15:12.310
Ooh, no, no, no, no...!

15:13.512 --> 15:15.914
That's what you get!
(chuckles)

15:15.916 --> 15:17.048
Ow!
- Ow!

15:17.050 --> 15:18.249
I can't go to jail.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.684
I'm too sarcastic
for the white gangs.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.519
Yeah, man, I'll get passed
around in there like a bong.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.553
Shut up.
- Ow!

15:22.555 --> 15:25.023
You're not going
to prison.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.859
The dangers of noise
pollution are real.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.727
According to the World Wide Web,

15:29.729 --> 15:33.197
it can cause lack
of concentration, nervousness,

15:33.199 --> 15:34.699
and misunderstandings.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.434
(banging)

15:36.436 --> 15:39.404
Sir! Sir...

15:39.406 --> 15:41.372
clearly, manual labor
has sculpted

15:41.374 --> 15:44.409
your body perfectly,
but could you please be quiet?

15:44.411 --> 15:46.544
(New York accent): Sorry, lady,
I gotta work all night.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.280
But, sir, people live
and work here.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.450
Babies sleep,
dogs nap by the window.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.718
Immigrants share noodles

15:53.720 --> 15:56.120
and dance to records
with abandon.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.057
You're right! We should be
looking out for each other.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.792
You said it, handsome guy.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.094
But you know who else
should be looking out for us?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.363
The city.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.500
(crowd cheering)

16:11.570 --> 16:14.806
Would you stop clapping?
This is an abomination.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.641
By the way, he... the only
reason he got that role

16:16.643 --> 16:18.142
is because he's sleeping
with her.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.811
You want to get a
cheeseburger sandwich?

16:19.813 --> 16:21.446
My nights just freed up.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.147
Of course.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.750
That sounds great
now that I can hear you.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.919
Mm. Nothing.
What? What are you doing?

16:27.921 --> 16:30.154
The cuffs on your jacket
just look a little short.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.323
What?
- They just look
a little short.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.926
Why are you telling me this now?
I got a new tailor.

16:34.928 --> 16:36.260
I'm really insecure about it.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.162
My God.
I'm Jessica Day.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.164
Thank you for listening.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.934
(crowd cheering)

16:42.936 --> 16:45.403
MAN: Tone it down!
Stop the noise!

16:47.840 --> 16:49.340
(clears throat loudly)

16:49.342 --> 16:51.776
Ah. N-Noise.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.177
N... Noise.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.279
Where would...
where would we be without you?

16:55.281 --> 16:57.148
I don't know.
A tree falls,

16:57.150 --> 17:01.019
a cabin is made, uh...

17:03.188 --> 17:05.456
(Schmidt muttering)

17:05.458 --> 17:06.691
It just...

17:06.693 --> 17:08.526
This doesn't-doesn't look right.

17:09.461 --> 17:10.828
A woman screams,

17:10.830 --> 17:13.631
a b... a baby is b...
a baby is born.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.967
Maybe if the speaker would stop
fiddling with his jacket...

17:15.969 --> 17:17.802
It just doesn't feel
like these are...

17:17.804 --> 17:19.804
He's saying
all the right things.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.472
That son-of-a-bitch tailor
ruined my jacket.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.807
(sighs)
That-that baby

17:22.809 --> 17:24.876
that screamed becomes a man

17:24.878 --> 17:27.812
and that-that was the story
of Abra-Abraham Lincoln.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.380
How dare you evoke Lincoln!

17:29.382 --> 17:31.382
He was our quietest president!

17:33.318 --> 17:35.186
I feel... I'm just so...

17:35.188 --> 17:37.221
I'm so uncomfortable right now,
because of my sleeves.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.823
I feel like an idiot
up here in this jacket!

17:38.825 --> 17:40.158
Nobody's telling me my-my...

17:40.160 --> 17:41.826
the tailoring is off!
I'm going...

17:41.828 --> 17:43.194
I'm seeing... I'm seeing
a new tailor, everyone.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.328
Sir?

17:44.330 --> 17:45.396
My tailor's great.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.031
I'll give you his number: eight.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.500
I look like a freaking matador
in this thing!

17:49.502 --> 17:51.002
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

17:51.004 --> 17:52.236
Sir, we've heard enough.
(Schmidt jabbering)

17:52.238 --> 17:54.038
Stand down! You look weak!

17:54.040 --> 17:59.177
Considering the incoherent and,
frankly, disturbing argument

17:59.179 --> 18:02.080
from the pro-noise lobby,
I have no choice

18:02.082 --> 18:04.382
but to recommend a switch
to the day schedule,

18:04.384 --> 18:05.550
effective immediately.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.018
(crowd cheering)

18:07.020 --> 18:08.252
New York!

18:08.254 --> 18:09.687
What?

18:09.689 --> 18:13.057
I'm Fawn Moscato,
the people's warrior.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.525
You're welcome, Los Angeles!

18:14.527 --> 18:17.228
Tomorrow is a new America!
Good night!

18:17.230 --> 18:19.397
(crowd cheering)

18:19.399 --> 18:21.466
Hello again.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.769
I would like
to once more revisit

18:24.771 --> 18:28.372
the bottomless clause
of the public nudity ordinance.

18:28.374 --> 18:31.476
Oh, my God, I almost
hired that guy as a sub.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.949
So that was a huge failure.
I feel like a Democrat.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.884
Why'd you have to say that
about my jacket?

18:39.886 --> 18:42.053
All right.
Okay, look, Jess told me to.

18:42.055 --> 18:44.455
I mean, I thought your sleeves
were fine. And by "fine,"

18:44.457 --> 18:46.958
I mean I could not care less.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.394
Oh, hello, shark.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.896
I am woman,

18:51.898 --> 18:55.299
the smartest species
of them all.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.271
I didn't realize
I'd finished that.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.240
I've been waiting here a while.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.075
You underhanded pig woman.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.911
You know, there are certain
things that you don't do,

19:06.913 --> 19:09.413
and exploiting a man's love
of tailoring is one of them.

19:09.415 --> 19:13.751
Which makes what you did
all the more impressive.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.153
Well, I felt dirty.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.621
I felt like Evil Winston.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.990
Remember when Winston was evil
for that week?

19:18.992 --> 19:20.491
I can't believe
I blew it with Fawn.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.959
You know,
she said that we could have sex

19:21.961 --> 19:23.761
in the room
where O.J. tried on the glove.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.596
Schmidt, it doesn't matter
what happened at the meeting.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.431
She doesn't care about you.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.100
She's a power-hungry,

19:29.102 --> 19:31.802
self-obsessed woman
who just wants a man to shut up

19:31.804 --> 19:34.005
and look pretty.
That's not what you want,

19:34.007 --> 19:36.140
is it?

19:36.142 --> 19:37.642
Please take me back.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.443
Look, I was duped
by a doe-eyed pixie

19:39.445 --> 19:42.180
and her Indian henchwoman.
Forgive me.
- It's fine.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.615
It actually worked out.
You were such a jackass

19:44.617 --> 19:46.817
up there that no one
who supported the construction

19:46.819 --> 19:48.519
will be able to hold it
against me.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.454
Plus, I picked up
a ton of votes.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.990
Or as I like to call them...

19:52.992 --> 19:54.959
tiny orgasms.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.294
So let me get this straight.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.129
You let me humiliate myself,

19:58.131 --> 20:00.798
in public,
for your own political gain?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.900
Hmm.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.204
Yes.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.805
You're the sexiest woman
that I've ever met.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.173
Ah...
- Ms. Moscato,
wherever you're going,

20:09.175 --> 20:10.174
take me with you.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.642
Please.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.612
It's "Councilwoman."

20:19.051 --> 20:21.485
And I'll call you
when I need you.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.487
That is gonna be...

20:23.489 --> 20:25.389
so frustrating.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.991
But I love it.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.826
Why are we in a church?
I once saw a priest

20:28.828 --> 20:31.162
drop his keys and bend
over and pick it up,

20:31.164 --> 20:33.998
and it was just so human that
it ruined religion for me.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.534
It's a support group
for families.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.669
Pack it down.
And you pack it down.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.037
And now weird friends.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.206
...until one day,
what happens?

20:42.208 --> 20:46.210
And I know that his training
officer is scary strong.

20:46.212 --> 20:49.747
But, um, he's still my friend,

20:49.749 --> 20:51.549
and the bad guys
are still bad,

20:51.551 --> 20:54.919
and I just wish I could put him
in a giant envelope and just...

20:54.921 --> 20:58.356
just mail him away from all
the bad guys... (crying)

20:58.358 --> 20:59.690
There's no shame in this.

20:59.692 --> 21:00.891
Do not judge this man.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.194
We won't. This is
a support group.

21:03.196 --> 21:05.529
I know what you're thinking:
he looks like a little punk.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.897
He looks like a little boy.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.567
We-we try not
to call names here.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.369
NICK: Everybody look down.
Don't look at him!
Good first day, Bishop.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.238
NICK: You never look
at a man when he cries!
Thanks.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.375
NICK: Back me up, man.
You ever let your friends
try on your uniform?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.543
What? No.
- Oh, yeah. Me either.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.112
Don't do it. I'm serious.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.214
Don't do that.
- I won't. I won't.

21:23.216 --> 21:24.548
MAN:
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

21:24.550 --> 21:26.617
you gotta keep clear!
- What?

21:26.619 --> 21:29.453
I'm-I'm not driving you
to the E.R. this time!

21:29.455 --> 21:31.055
It's your problem!
Get out of the way!

21:31.057 --> 21:32.556
Don't look at me like that!

21:32.558 --> 21:33.791
MAN 2:
All right, all right!

21:33.793 --> 21:34.892
Morning, Jerry!

21:34.894 --> 21:35.893
Hey, how you doing?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.128
How are you doing?

21:37.130 --> 21:39.797
Eh, different day,
same bucket, right?

21:39.799 --> 21:41.599
Is that today's<i> Times?</i>

21:41.601 --> 21:43.267
Kristof's got a piece
on net neutrality.

21:43.269 --> 21:44.802
It's very complex.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.904
I don't know where I stand.
What kind of bagel

21:46.906 --> 21:48.572
you want this morning--
uh, poppy seed or sesame?

21:48.574 --> 21:49.974
I'm going sesame today.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.909
All right.
- Get me a little
schmear, would you?

21:51.911 --> 21:54.478
