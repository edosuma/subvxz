02:05.531 --> 02:07.500
Ever notice how in high school

02:07.566 --> 02:09.558
There's just something
about being first,

02:09.634 --> 02:12.434
Like that girl who's always
first to raise her hand

02:12.504 --> 02:15.906
Or that first kid to own every
new cutting-edge ithingy?

02:15.975 --> 02:20.845
There's so much pressure to
be a trend-setter, a pioneer.

02:20.913 --> 02:22.677
Well, not me.

02:22.748 --> 02:26.651
Tanner Daniels was just like any
other average comic-book geek,

02:26.719 --> 02:29.382
More than content to
fly under the radar

02:29.455 --> 02:31.651
And leave the trailblazing
to the others.

02:31.724 --> 02:34.888
After all, of the many firsts
my peers were vying for,

02:34.960 --> 02:37.862
One still remained
conspicuously up for grabs.

02:37.930 --> 02:40.593
Never in the history
of north gateway high

02:40.666 --> 02:42.726
Had any student admitted out loud

02:42.801 --> 02:46.499
To being an honest-to-goodness,
card-carrying, proud...

02:46.572 --> 02:49.406
Or even slightly modest...
homosexual,

02:49.475 --> 02:51.671
Including me and my
best friend, Brent.

02:51.744 --> 02:54.475
Explain this to me again.
How will being the first out kid

02:54.546 --> 02:56.708
In school make you
instantly popular?

02:56.782 --> 03:00.014
It's simple. All the teen
and tween rags agree...

03:00.286 --> 03:03.017
The hottest new trend
sweeping schools worldwide

03:03.289 --> 03:05.690
Is the G.B.F.

03:05.758 --> 03:07.954
G.B.F.?
Gay best friend.

03:08.027 --> 03:10.622
Every celeb has one, so
every teen girl needs one.

03:10.696 --> 03:13.393
And pretty soon, all three
prom-queen front-runners

03:13.465 --> 03:15.593
Will be battling it
out for my attention.

03:17.403 --> 03:19.463
<i>♪ H ♪</i>

03:19.538 --> 03:21.006
<i>♪ E ♪</i>

03:21.073 --> 03:23.599
<i>♪ R ♪</i>

03:23.676 --> 03:27.613
Three powerful cliques
controlled north gateway high,

03:27.680 --> 03:29.046
And the queen bitch from each

03:29.315 --> 03:31.716
Ruled our school from
nearly every direction.

03:31.784 --> 03:34.845
Caprice winters dominated

03:34.920 --> 03:37.515
As queen of drama,
all three kinds of choir,

03:37.589 --> 03:40.650
And our school's loose network
of minority students.

03:40.726 --> 03:44.356
Then there was 'Shley Osgoode,
short for "Ashley,"

03:44.430 --> 03:46.558
Which was about as edgy as she got.

03:46.632 --> 03:49.466
With her perpetually sunny
Mormon disposition,

03:49.535 --> 03:52.334
'Shley ruled all wearers
of shiny gold crosses

03:52.404 --> 03:54.430
And goody-two-shoes.

03:54.506 --> 03:58.773
But neither could hold a
candle to Fawcett Brooks.

03:58.844 --> 04:00.574
By far the hottest girl in school

04:00.646 --> 04:02.478
And empress of the rich and popular,

04:02.548 --> 04:05.780
Fawcett loved fads
and hated fatties.

04:05.851 --> 04:07.752
Her trademark golden tresses

04:07.820 --> 04:10.449
Had won her "best hair"
three years in a row,

04:10.522 --> 04:12.047
an unprecedented achievement

04:12.124 --> 04:16.060
because you're supposed
to be a senior to win.

04:16.128 --> 04:19.029
Like neighboring warlords
in a third-world country,

04:19.098 --> 04:22.330
They maintained an
uneasy balance of power,

04:22.401 --> 04:23.733
Friendly but always vigilant

04:23.802 --> 04:25.862
Of anything that could
upset the truce

04:25.938 --> 04:29.102
And create all-out social warfare.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.810
So, I'm thinking prom,
for maximum effect.

04:31.877 --> 04:33.709
That way, no matter who
wins king or queen,

04:33.779 --> 04:35.077
All anyone will remember is me.

04:35.147 --> 04:37.981
Why not send out a mass
text and be done with it?

04:38.050 --> 04:39.541
"F.Y.I., I like guys.

04:39.618 --> 04:41.416
Now let's never speak
of this again."

04:41.487 --> 04:43.820
Tanner, you cannot come out
via text. That is so gay.

04:43.889 --> 04:47.883
Well, you can count me out...
Er, in, I guess.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.080
Oh, how very early 2000s of you.
I'm so not surprised.

04:50.129 --> 04:52.496
Yeah, Glenn here is more likely
to come out than Tanner,

04:52.564 --> 04:54.897
And he is our token
vagina enthusiast.

04:54.967 --> 04:56.731
Damn straight.
Literally.

04:56.802 --> 05:00.534
Look, it's not a matter of if
I'm coming out. Of course I am.

05:00.606 --> 05:04.566
It's the "when"
I'm still working on.

05:04.643 --> 05:06.703
I just can't believe
that you'd be happy

05:06.779 --> 05:08.941
Being some vapid whore's
sexless accessory.

05:09.014 --> 05:10.812
And what makes you think
this plan will even work?

05:10.883 --> 05:13.682
Oh, you know I've been
doing my reconnaissance.

05:13.752 --> 05:15.152
Ready? Okay!

05:15.421 --> 05:17.720
Fawcett's the obvious
prom-queen front-runner,

05:17.790 --> 05:20.692
But since mega-hottie Hamilton
smith dumped her last week,

05:20.759 --> 05:23.126
She's vulnerable, and she'll
be looking for an edge...

05:23.195 --> 05:25.027
whoo!
...any edge.

05:25.097 --> 05:27.464
What the hell was that? You guys
were totally out of sync.

05:27.533 --> 05:29.525
It's that time of
the month, ladies.

05:29.601 --> 05:32.127
Please. Their "must-have"
list is so five minutes ago.

05:32.204 --> 05:34.867
Let's hear it.
This month's are...

05:34.940 --> 05:36.806
totally bedazzled vintage totes,

05:36.875 --> 05:38.639
Chunky cashmere ironic shrugs...

05:38.710 --> 05:39.973
been there, worn that.

05:40.045 --> 05:42.446
Distressed jeggings...
Cute!

05:42.514 --> 05:44.005
I practically invented them.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.778
Cold Langu.

05:45.851 --> 05:48.184
And a G.B.F.

05:48.454 --> 05:51.185
It... It stands for...
I know what it stands for.

05:52.958 --> 05:55.655
Well, I can't help it that the
school is devoid of the gay.

05:55.727 --> 05:57.855
I mean, if there were some,
they'd obvi worship me.

05:57.930 --> 06:00.422
I mean, look at this.

06:00.499 --> 06:01.899
No, no, totally.
They'd worship you.

06:01.934 --> 06:03.732
Like, look at you.
You're, like, beautiful, like...

06:03.802 --> 06:05.930
Okay, so, Fawcett
might fall for it,

06:06.004 --> 06:08.838
But what makes you think a
super-Chris like 'Shley Osgood

06:08.907 --> 06:10.034
Would ever want a G.B.F.?

06:10.108 --> 06:11.701
'Shley is Mormon.
Hey, Glenn.

06:11.777 --> 06:13.837
Their whole shtick is just
being relentlessly nice to you

06:13.912 --> 06:16.507
Until you give up and throw on a
pair of their magic underwear.

06:16.582 --> 06:18.608
Yeah, they smile to your face
and prop-8 you in the back.

06:18.684 --> 06:22.712
I can't believe our godless
peers read this blasphemy.

06:22.788 --> 06:25.223
They're trying to
make sin seem "in."

06:25.491 --> 06:27.050
I don't know.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.185
Don't you ever think it would
be kind of neat to meet one?

06:29.261 --> 06:31.890
Like a real, live gay?
What?

06:31.964 --> 06:33.990
You know, we could
bring him youth group

06:34.066 --> 06:36.467
Or take him out for
milkshakes or something.

06:36.535 --> 06:38.561
And then if we're all
super-duper nice to him,

06:38.637 --> 06:40.230
Maybe he'd realize
that the only person

06:40.506 --> 06:43.032
He should be gay for is Jesus.

06:43.108 --> 06:46.670
'Shley, you can't just
befriend these people.

06:46.745 --> 06:47.906
They're out to steal

06:47.980 --> 06:52.213
Our brothers, boyfriends,
our gerbils,

06:52.284 --> 06:54.617
All as part of a secret agenda

06:54.686 --> 06:56.287
To spread their gaybies
all over America.

06:56.522 --> 06:58.514
Aww.
Gay babies?

06:58.590 --> 07:01.492
No!
Like... like gay rabies.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.256
Bitch!

07:03.529 --> 07:06.556
'Shley will try to befriend
me and convert me,

07:06.632 --> 07:08.498
And that'll make Fawcett
want me even more.

07:08.567 --> 07:10.035
So, what about Caprice?
Please.

07:10.102 --> 07:13.504
Miss Caprice cannot stand not
being the center of attention.

07:13.572 --> 07:15.939
You all saw her mostly
plagiarized musical mash-up

07:16.008 --> 07:17.806
Of "mean girls" last spring.

07:17.876 --> 07:21.176
<i>♪ Mean girls ♪</i>

07:21.246 --> 07:24.216
<i>♪ Mean plastic girls ♪</i>

07:24.283 --> 07:28.118

07:28.186 --> 07:31.554

07:31.623 --> 07:32.921
That actually could have
been kind of brilliant.

07:32.991 --> 07:34.584
But it wasn't.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.060
Caprice needs a gay visionary

07:36.128 --> 07:39.621
To shepherd her career
towards iconic Diva-Dom.

07:39.698 --> 07:41.829
I just hope everything
goes according to plan.

07:41.900 --> 07:43.835
You won't forget us
when you're in a new

07:43.902 --> 07:46.064
Social stratosphere, will you?
No promises.

07:46.138 --> 07:47.697
Oh, my god!
Is that the new one?!

07:47.773 --> 07:49.105
Oh, sweet, dude!

07:49.174 --> 07:52.144
And I still carry the last
flip phone on the planet.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.577
We are so downloading guydar.

07:54.646 --> 07:56.979
What the hell is guydar?
Where have you been?

07:57.049 --> 08:00.645
It's the new app that lets
gay guys find other gay guys

08:00.719 --> 08:03.154
Through state-of-the-art,
globally positioned technology.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.156
She knows.
I only know about it

08:05.223 --> 08:07.590
Because Brent here tried to
download it onto my phone.

08:07.659 --> 08:10.652
Yeah, and hetero buzzkill
here totally cock-blocked me.

08:10.729 --> 08:12.630
I'm not soiling my pristine phone

08:12.698 --> 08:14.326
With some slutty gay hookup app.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.762
Tanner, we're not
gonna do anything.

08:16.835 --> 08:18.770
We're just gonna see if there are

08:18.837 --> 08:20.669
any other gay guys in this town

08:20.739 --> 08:23.140
and find out how many cubic
feet away they are from us.

08:23.208 --> 08:24.836
It's science.

08:24.910 --> 08:26.902
And it's about to change our lives.

08:26.979 --> 08:30.677
Which was actually true,
but not in the way we imagined.

08:30.749 --> 08:32.217
But it isn't fair, Ms. Hoegel.

08:32.284 --> 08:35.345
I'm sorry, Soledad, but the
school board was clear.

08:35.621 --> 08:38.090
Now, we can't have a
gay/straight alliance

08:38.155 --> 08:39.988
Without an actual gay member.

08:40.058 --> 08:41.754
Just because we're all straight

08:41.827 --> 08:44.353
Doesn't mean that there aren't
gay kids at this school.

08:44.630 --> 08:46.911
My future G.B.F. is just waiting
to come out of the closet

08:46.965 --> 08:48.957
And tell me how fierce I am.

08:49.034 --> 08:51.663
Please, Ms. "H,"
this club is all I have.

08:51.737 --> 08:56.198
Is this about helping queer and
questioning kids or yourself?

08:56.274 --> 08:58.004
It's all for the gays!

08:58.076 --> 09:01.638
They need to at least
know this group exists.

09:01.713 --> 09:03.944
What if Viola here
came out as a lesbian?

09:04.016 --> 09:06.747
Hey!
I'm strictly dickly, yo.

09:06.818 --> 09:08.616
Just take one for the team.

09:08.687 --> 09:11.657
Now, Soledad!
Or the fact that Braxton has two mommies...

09:11.723 --> 09:13.624
That has got to count
for something.

09:13.692 --> 09:15.991
And both Mrs. Cooper-Cullins
were so helpful

09:16.061 --> 09:18.053
In organizing last
month's Vegan bake sale.

09:18.130 --> 09:19.860
Moms say hi, by the way.

09:19.931 --> 09:21.866
Hi, moms.

09:21.933 --> 09:25.768
But it's simply not
enough, I'm afraid.

09:29.374 --> 09:31.900
Please, Ms. Hoegel, just
buy me a few more weeks.

09:31.977 --> 09:33.673
Like, I will find a real-life gay,

09:33.745 --> 09:35.737
Even if I have to drag
the little teen queen

09:35.814 --> 09:37.009
Out of the closet myself.

09:37.082 --> 09:38.778
Soledad, I don't
want you conducting

09:38.850 --> 09:40.250
Some sort of a gay witch-hunt.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.787
No, of course not, Ms. Hoegel.
Give it time.

09:42.854 --> 09:45.153
One day you will meet
the gay of your dreams,

09:45.223 --> 09:46.919
And it will be the happiest,

09:46.992 --> 09:48.858
Most fulfilling day of your life.

09:48.927 --> 09:52.261
Then it's all downhill from there.

09:57.903 --> 10:00.930
Hi, there, Soledad.
Or whatever.

10:01.006 --> 10:03.202
You're prez of the school's
currently gay-less

10:03.275 --> 10:05.744
G.S.A., Right?
Yeah, something like that.

10:05.811 --> 10:08.212
Couldn't help but
overhear your dilem.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.182
I might have an idea
that could help you out.

10:11.249 --> 10:15.084
Keep up.

10:15.153 --> 10:16.815
The Wi-Fi password is "Lilo."

10:16.888 --> 10:19.858
Oh, hey, guys. Where's the fire?
Oh! Hi, mom.

10:19.925 --> 10:23.089
Um, we just got this really
tough math assignment, so...

10:23.161 --> 10:24.789
Oh. Math.

10:24.863 --> 10:26.855
It's gonna be, like, a
really tough nut to bust.

10:26.932 --> 10:28.161
T-T-Y-L!

10:28.233 --> 10:29.895
Later, Mrs. Van Camp.

10:29.968 --> 10:34.269
Be safe!
W-with your math.

10:34.339 --> 10:37.935
Your mom totally knows and
also thinks we're doing it.

10:38.009 --> 10:40.001
Why don't you just tell her?

10:40.078 --> 10:42.206
Oh, she's so smug,
dropping her little hints.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.249
I'm not gonna give her
the satisfaction.

10:44.316 --> 10:46.285
Maybe when she gets
the balls to ask me.

10:46.351 --> 10:48.786
Maybe she's just
respecting your privacy.

10:48.854 --> 10:51.824
She wants to milk this for
all the drama it's worth.

10:51.890 --> 10:54.724
Trust.
I am her son, after all.

11:05.337 --> 11:09.502
Do we have to listen to this
heinous pop dance crap?

11:09.775 --> 11:11.175
Shut up.
You know you love it.

11:11.243 --> 11:14.145
<i>♪ Why should I be a
victim of this love? ♪</i>

11:14.212 --> 11:17.046
<i>♪ Why should I feel so ashamed? ♪</i>

11:17.115 --> 11:20.108
Knock, knock!

11:20.185 --> 11:21.744
What?!
What do you want?!

11:21.820 --> 11:23.083
Everybody decent?

11:23.155 --> 11:24.248
Yeah, mom.

11:24.322 --> 11:26.314
No, I'm serious.
Yes, we're decent!

11:26.391 --> 11:28.758
Oh, god. Okay, good.
Whew! Just checking.

11:28.827 --> 11:32.764
Oh, O-M-G!
This be my jam. Whoo!

11:32.831 --> 11:34.493
Hey, you boys have any poppers?

11:34.566 --> 11:36.831
A popper would really hit
the spot right about now.

11:36.902 --> 11:42.068
Mom, um, yeah, this, um, dance
party is invitation-only, so...

11:42.140 --> 11:44.939
I simply came up to tell you boys

11:45.010 --> 11:50.313
That I won't be back up here
for at least one hour or so.

11:50.382 --> 11:53.352
Relax. Do your thing.
Get crazy.

11:53.418 --> 11:54.977
Thanks.
I'm good with it.

11:55.053 --> 11:57.045
Thank you. All right. Bye!
Yeah. Great. All right.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.254
Now that we've banished the beast,

12:00.325 --> 12:02.556
Let's download that app
and find us some mens.

12:02.828 --> 12:04.820
What if we see someone
we know on there

12:04.896 --> 12:07.161
Or someone finds my phone?

12:07.232 --> 12:09.258
It's my ass on the line.

12:09.334 --> 12:11.132
Tan, please,

12:11.203 --> 12:13.283
If I don't at least get my
makeout on before college,

12:13.338 --> 12:15.102
I'll be playing sexual
catch-up for years.

12:15.173 --> 12:16.835
I just want to find
out if there are

12:16.908 --> 12:19.343
Any other gay guys there
that, you know, aren't you.

12:19.411 --> 12:21.175
You know, no offense.

12:23.548 --> 12:25.915
Okay, fine.

12:25.984 --> 12:27.919
But we're gonna need
a profile picture first.

12:27.986 --> 12:29.978
Say "cheese."
Cheddar!

12:31.156 --> 12:32.818
Let me see.

12:32.891 --> 12:34.951
No.

12:35.026 --> 12:36.995
Th... Hey!

12:37.062 --> 12:39.293
Relax. You'll just be
another headless torso

12:39.364 --> 12:40.992
In a sea of low self-esteem.

12:41.066 --> 12:43.160
P.S... Your abs ain't
too bad, Mr. Four-pack.

12:43.235 --> 12:45.033
Really?

12:45.103 --> 12:47.095
Hmm.

12:47.172 --> 12:49.971
Now let's see what the filthy gays
of north gateway think of them.

12:50.041 --> 12:52.033
You sure this is a good idea?

12:52.110 --> 12:55.410
Was Drake on "Degrassi"?
The answer is yes.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.142
Bad-ass rapper Drake

12:57.215 --> 12:59.912
Was on a wholesome Canadian
after-school soap opera.

12:59.985 --> 13:01.851
Never forget.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.388
We had little luck

13:03.455 --> 13:06.015
Chatting up dudes on
Guydar that night,

13:06.091 --> 13:08.219
But the next day,
Soledad and her swarm

13:08.293 --> 13:10.558
Of blossoming fruit
flies were preparing

13:10.629 --> 13:12.495
To put the app to much better use.

13:12.564 --> 13:14.931
Okay, ladies, somewhere
in this school,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.400
There's a sexually confused boy

13:16.468 --> 13:18.369
With no one to turn
to and nowhere to go.

13:18.436 --> 13:22.567
So we must hunt him down...
To help him, of course.

13:22.641 --> 13:24.542
According to a very
knowledgeable source

13:24.609 --> 13:26.373
On what's in style,
this guydar thing

13:26.444 --> 13:29.107
Is all the rage with the gays,
especially the closet cases.

13:29.180 --> 13:31.308
So, we all got our Faux-Mo
avatars ready, right?

13:31.383 --> 13:34.649
Yep. Mine's of Robert
Pattinson's air-brushed torso.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.582
That's what they like, right?
Totally.

13:36.655 --> 13:38.419
And you've got Zac Efron.
Perfect.

13:38.490 --> 13:40.425
And Persephone's
rocking Adam Lambert.

13:40.492 --> 13:42.927
Oh, great. I think we got
all our bases covered.

13:42.994 --> 13:45.429
Let the manhunt begin!

13:45.497 --> 13:46.497
Oh, shit!

13:46.498 --> 13:48.330
What was that?

13:48.400 --> 13:50.528
Oh, um, nothing.

13:50.602 --> 13:53.572
Just stating the obvious in here.

13:53.638 --> 13:55.937
Ew. Let's go.

13:56.007 --> 13:59.034
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

14:06.084 --> 14:08.212
Tanner! Hand it over.

14:08.286 --> 14:10.187
You'll get it back
at the end of the day.

14:10.255 --> 14:12.417
Shit.

14:12.490 --> 14:14.550
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Shit!

14:20.065 --> 14:22.360
Montag.

14:22.434 --> 14:25.136
Dienstag.

14:25.203 --> 14:27.667
Mittwoch.

14:27.739 --> 14:29.230
Donnerstag.

14:29.307 --> 14:30.935
What's up, bitch?

14:32.510 --> 14:33.671
Herr Brent.

14:33.745 --> 14:35.008
Ein moment, Frau Burkhardt.

14:41.586 --> 14:44.249
Oh, Scheisse.

14:45.557 --> 14:48.152
Ooh, I got one!
4packboy95.

14:48.226 --> 14:49.285
He's 400 feet away.

14:49.361 --> 14:51.592
I got him, too!
This way!

14:51.663 --> 14:54.326
Yeah!

14:54.399 --> 14:56.027
Give me your phone now!
Now!

14:56.101 --> 14:57.330
Oh, my god, Brent!

14:57.402 --> 14:59.633
You're obsessed
with that stupid app.

14:59.704 --> 15:02.697
You don't understand. Soledad
and her gaggle of junior hacks

15:02.774 --> 15:05.243
Are using guydar
to track gays at the school.

15:05.310 --> 15:08.280
Oh, my god. Slatsky took
my phone in third period.

15:08.346 --> 15:10.008
It's still signed on.

15:10.081 --> 15:12.516
I am not taking the fall for this!

15:12.584 --> 15:14.485
Time for the big, dramatic
coming-out you've always wanted.

15:14.552 --> 15:16.248
Wait. No, no, no, no!
This is not how I planned it.

15:16.321 --> 15:18.449
P-P-Prom is months away!

15:18.523 --> 15:19.582
It's coming from in here.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.216
We are here to help.
Come on, guys.

15:21.292 --> 15:23.488
What do you think you're doing?

15:23.561 --> 15:25.621
Who do these hairless
abs belong to?

15:32.103 --> 15:34.334
The signal's coming from
the front of the classroom...

15:34.406 --> 15:35.446
you have two seconds to...

15:35.507 --> 15:37.066
from right around...

15:37.142 --> 15:38.735
Mr. Slatsky's desk?!

15:38.810 --> 15:40.745
Mr. Slatsky?
Mr. Slatsky?

15:40.812 --> 15:42.542
You're married to a lady,

15:42.614 --> 15:45.448
And these are clearly not your abs.

15:45.517 --> 15:47.247
This is false advertising.

15:47.318 --> 15:49.150
What are you talking about?

15:49.220 --> 15:51.314
Wait!
It's not Mr. Slatsky's.

15:51.389 --> 15:53.153
Tanner, I don't think you should.

15:53.224 --> 15:54.658
This is your cellphone, correct?

15:57.462 --> 16:00.489
I-I guess it is.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.761
You're the secret gay.

16:04.836 --> 16:07.362
But you're not even that fabulous.

16:07.439 --> 16:10.307
I...

16:10.375 --> 16:12.207
guess I am...

16:12.277 --> 16:14.542
n-not fabulous, but gay.

16:14.612 --> 16:16.547
I'm gay, I guess.

16:18.516 --> 16:22.612
Oh, we've got one,
our very own homosexual!

16:24.823 --> 16:28.555
Tweet this right now.

16:28.626 --> 16:32.063
We did it!
I'm so excited!

16:38.670 --> 16:40.832
What are you looking at, fag-off?

16:41.106 --> 16:42.369
What, are you...

16:42.440 --> 16:45.239
What, are you checking out
my... balls?

16:45.310 --> 16:47.541
You trying to check out my balls?

16:47.612 --> 16:50.673
Tanner! Wait! Wait!
I'm your friend!

16:50.748 --> 16:53.197
Leave him alone, you
desperate psycho-bitch.

16:53.223 --> 16:53.834
Whoa.

16:53.885 --> 16:55.251
That was really mean.
Oh, really?

16:55.320 --> 16:57.118
Are you a psycho,
and are you a bitch?

16:57.188 --> 16:58.781
- I am his best friend.
- I couldn't believe it.

16:58.857 --> 17:00.587
I'd been so careful for 17 years.

17:00.658 --> 17:02.320
I mean, I learned how to clear

17:02.393 --> 17:04.191
The internet history when I was 11.

17:04.262 --> 17:07.561
One stupid slip-up
had cost me everything,

17:07.632 --> 17:09.863
And I had one person to blame.

17:14.539 --> 17:16.473
Hey, girl, hey.

17:16.540 --> 17:19.840
"Hey"?
That's all you have to say?

17:19.911 --> 17:23.176
I'm sorry. I-I freaked.
It happened so fast. I...

17:23.248 --> 17:25.273
You were the one
who wanted to come out!

17:25.349 --> 17:27.648
I can't believe
you let me take the fall!

17:27.719 --> 17:28.778
Shh. Please. Okay, look.

17:28.853 --> 17:30.378
Maybe you can turn this around,

17:30.455 --> 17:32.219
You know, like pretend
it was a joke.

17:32.290 --> 17:34.657
You can't "no homo" this, Brent.

17:34.726 --> 17:36.627
I'm basically a dead man,

17:36.694 --> 17:38.595
And what kills me
is you're the Queeny one.

17:38.663 --> 17:40.256
The least you can do is come out

17:40.331 --> 17:42.197
And take your share
of the daily beatings.

17:42.267 --> 17:44.793
I can't. I mean,
it would be, you know, pathetic,

17:44.869 --> 17:46.565
Like I'm copying you or something.

17:46.638 --> 17:48.732
You know what?
I blame myself.

17:48.806 --> 17:51.366
All I ever do is go
with the flow, your flow

17:51.442 --> 17:52.910
99% of the time.

17:53.178 --> 17:55.773
Oh, please, Tanner. We both know
you love being the sidekick.

17:55.847 --> 17:59.147
Oh. So, I'm the sidekick?
Wow.

17:59.217 --> 18:01.777
Well, at least now I realize
all you care about is yourself,

18:01.853 --> 18:04.254
You self-absorbed,
gutless little faggot!

18:04.322 --> 18:05.813
Tanner Daniels.

18:05.890 --> 18:08.860
Christ, Tanner.
I said I'm sorry.

18:08.927 --> 18:11.260
Sorry, Mrs. Van Camp,

18:11.329 --> 18:13.457
But I'm allowed to use that word,

18:13.531 --> 18:15.363
Seeing as how I am one...

18:16.634 --> 18:18.603
just like your son.

18:20.838 --> 18:23.672
Tanner, you had no right.

18:23.741 --> 18:27.303
Well, what do you care?
You know she knows.

18:27.378 --> 18:29.540
It was a total dick move,

18:29.614 --> 18:32.846
And I immediately regretted it,
but it was too late.

18:32.917 --> 18:36.820
Like Lex Luthor and Clark Kent
or professor X and Magneto,

18:36.888 --> 18:40.188
Brent and I went from
best friends to archenemies

18:40.258 --> 18:41.487
In a matter of seconds.

18:41.559 --> 18:43.653
Hey, Tanner.
How was school, honey?

18:43.728 --> 18:45.663
Uh, hey, Shannon, dad.

18:45.730 --> 18:50.293
It was uneventful, lacking events.

18:50.368 --> 18:52.496
Why? You didn't hear anything,
did you?

18:52.570 --> 18:57.270
No. What would we
have heard about, Tanner?

18:57.342 --> 19:01.905
Nothing, of course, because
of the whole nothing thing.

19:01.980 --> 19:03.778
Well, honey, that's great.
Are you hungry?

19:03.848 --> 19:07.216
'Cause I made my world-famous,
homemade, gluten-free popsicles.

19:07.285 --> 19:08.583
They are delicious.

19:08.653 --> 19:11.213
Oh, I hope you made them
extra thick and fruity,

19:11.289 --> 19:12.882
Just the way Tanner likes them.

19:12.957 --> 19:14.983
What?!
Uh, I mean, right.

19:15.260 --> 19:18.594
Uh, thanks for freezing juice
on a stick for me, Shannon,

19:18.663 --> 19:19.926
But I'm good.

19:19.998 --> 19:21.660
Maybe you'll have one later.

19:21.733 --> 19:23.827
Maybe I'll have one right now.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.301
Ooh.

19:25.370 --> 19:27.635
What flavor did you make?

19:27.705 --> 19:29.731
Cherry.
Ohh.

19:29.807 --> 19:33.437
The next day, I tried to keep
an even lower profile that usual,

19:33.511 --> 19:37.505
But my power to go unnoticed
had been completely neutralized.

19:37.582 --> 19:39.380
Hey. Remember me?

19:39.450 --> 19:42.579
Hey, Sophe. Sorry I haven't
texted/called you back.

19:42.654 --> 19:45.021
I'm just really overwhelmed
right now.

19:45.290 --> 19:47.486
Look, I know
you're pissed at Brent,

19:47.558 --> 19:49.527
And, honestly, I would be, too.

19:49.594 --> 19:51.995
But what he did was an accident.

19:52.063 --> 19:53.793
What you did with his mom was...
Wait.

19:53.865 --> 19:55.424
Really? Wow.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.800
Of all people, I never expected
you to take his side.

19:58.870 --> 20:01.704
He outed me to the entire school.

20:01.773 --> 20:04.402
And plus, his mom already knew.

20:04.475 --> 20:06.595
But it wasn't your job to
tell her, and you know that.

20:06.644 --> 20:08.977
You know what, Sophe?
I have bigger things

20:09.047 --> 20:11.812
To worry about than
Brent's psycho mama drama.

20:13.584 --> 20:15.650
Ohh!

20:15.720 --> 20:17.746
Well, hey, there, tan tan.

20:17.822 --> 20:20.758
You know, I used to think
you were a little fag.

20:20.825 --> 20:23.795
I didn't realize you were
actually a full-fledged homo!

20:23.861 --> 20:26.296
That doesn't even make sense.

20:26.364 --> 20:28.299
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?
You calling me stupid?

20:28.366 --> 20:30.767
You calling me stupid and gay?

20:30.835 --> 20:34.567
Hamilton, take your hands off him.

20:34.639 --> 20:36.437
Back off, babe.
We're history,

20:36.507 --> 20:38.999
Which means you don't tell
me what to do anymore.

20:39.077 --> 20:41.478
History... now,
that's an appropriate word

20:41.546 --> 20:43.845
Because that's what
your sex life is gonna be

20:43.915 --> 20:45.474
If you don't leave him alone.

20:45.550 --> 20:47.644
After all, I know things...

20:47.719 --> 20:50.018
Tiny, little, pinky-sized details.

20:50.088 --> 20:52.387
Touch him again,
and you won't be able

20:52.457 --> 20:54.449
To get as much
as a half-ass handjob

20:54.525 --> 20:56.721
From some flag-twirling
color guard skank.

20:56.794 --> 20:58.956
Bitch, you wouldn't dare.

20:59.030 --> 21:00.760
Try me.

21:09.974 --> 21:11.465
You okay, babes?

21:11.542 --> 21:13.374
I'm... fine.

21:13.444 --> 21:14.912
I'm Fawcett.

21:14.979 --> 21:16.675
Yeah, I know.

21:16.748 --> 21:18.740
You doing anything after school?

21:18.816 --> 21:21.650
Want to go sip extra-large
low-fat iced coffees

21:21.719 --> 21:23.881
And talk shit about people?

21:23.955 --> 21:26.891
Hey, there, you.
I like coffee, too.

21:26.958 --> 21:28.085
I'll come with.

21:28.159 --> 21:30.060
Ooh!
I like decaf.

21:30.128 --> 21:32.120
How nice for you both.

21:32.397 --> 21:36.664
Well, uh, we could all go together?

21:36.734 --> 21:39.533
Fine. Whatevs.
Let's.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.709
So...

21:51.783 --> 21:54.116
so, you're a gay now.

21:54.185 --> 21:57.019
Uh, not now.
I mean, I've always been.

21:57.088 --> 21:59.057
Just now everybody knows.

21:59.123 --> 22:01.149
Are you gonna audition
for the spring musical?

22:01.426 --> 22:03.588
'Cause we're doing "The Wiz,"
and we're gonna need,

22:03.661 --> 22:05.459
Like, as many minorities
as we can get.

22:05.530 --> 22:08.056
I'm not much for
the whole singing or dancing

22:08.132 --> 22:10.465
Or being onstage thing.

22:10.535 --> 22:11.901
You sure you're a 'mo?

22:11.969 --> 22:13.995
What gay stuff do you, like, like?

22:14.071 --> 22:16.540
Um, I'm into comics.

22:16.607 --> 22:18.576
Like Kathy griffin?
She's Hilar.

22:18.643 --> 22:20.908
Uh, no, like comic books.

22:20.978 --> 22:23.948
That's not gay.
That's just lame.

22:24.015 --> 22:25.950
You don't even sound
like the ones on bravo.

22:26.017 --> 22:29.010
Say the word "fierce."
Ooh.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.419
Yeah, I don't really say that word.

22:31.489 --> 22:33.151
Oh, well, maybe it's like Caprice.

22:33.224 --> 22:35.420
I mean, she's black, but
she doesn't talk like them.

22:35.493 --> 22:38.429
Excuse me?
Well, not all the time.

22:38.496 --> 22:40.055
Yeah, Ashley, it's like
when we call you a "Mormon"

22:40.131 --> 22:41.997
But forget the second "M."

22:42.066 --> 22:44.763
Anyway, what about those other
losers you eat lunch with?

22:44.836 --> 22:46.429
They seem way gayer than you.

22:46.504 --> 22:49.531
Oh, no, no, no, no. I heard
Brent is like super hetero.

22:49.607 --> 22:51.200
That's why they're all fighting.

22:51.476 --> 22:54.036
That Glenn, though... Oh, he
is way too cute to be straight.

22:54.111 --> 22:56.103
Uh, Glenn is so not gay.
Trust me.

22:56.180 --> 22:59.150
I would know 'cause I've got
that gaydar thing, right?

22:59.217 --> 23:02.119
But even that Sophie girl...
She's always seemed like

23:02.186 --> 23:04.018
A mucho muncher supreme to me.

23:04.088 --> 23:06.717
I don't think so.
I mean, she hates all the guys

23:06.791 --> 23:09.158
At this school, but
she hates all the girls, too.

23:09.227 --> 23:11.924
Well, Tanner,
I just want you to know

23:11.996 --> 23:14.124
That I'm totally fine
with your homosexiness.

23:14.198 --> 23:15.791
I mean, it is a sin and all,

23:15.867 --> 23:17.836
But we Mormons pretty much think
everything's a sin,

23:17.902 --> 23:21.031
Including those caffeinated beverages
you guys are sucking down right now.

23:21.105 --> 23:23.185
So, if you're all gonna
burn in hell for an eternity,

23:23.207 --> 23:24.675
You may as well have a nice time

23:24.742 --> 23:26.540
Being all queer and stuff
while you're here.

23:26.611 --> 23:29.080
Well, that's at least consistent
of you, 'Shley.

23:29.146 --> 23:31.741
I have an amazeballs idea.

23:31.816 --> 23:34.183
This Saturday, why don't you
and me come back here,

23:34.252 --> 23:35.982
And we can totally gay you over?

23:36.053 --> 23:38.716
Oh, and I know all the stylists
at heroine salon.

23:38.789 --> 23:41.054
I'm sure they can give you
something butchy

23:41.125 --> 23:42.559
And Rihanna-esque.

23:42.627 --> 23:44.789
I think he just needs
a trim, sweetie,

23:44.862 --> 23:46.091
Not a full-blown weave.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.688
These are clips, boo.

23:47.765 --> 23:49.597
Um, I-I have a gift card

23:49.667 --> 23:51.602
To banana republic
that's half full.

23:51.669 --> 23:55.765
Well, perf. I guess
we'll see you both there.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.139
None of them wanted to share

23:58.209 --> 24:01.509
The school's newest
limited-edition status symbol,

24:01.579 --> 24:03.605
And if that meant pretending
to play nice with each other,

24:03.681 --> 24:05.013
Game on.

24:05.082 --> 24:07.642
That weekend, I quickly
discovered that if I was

24:07.718 --> 24:10.119
Going to accept the
protection of the "in" crowd,

24:10.187 --> 24:12.088
I had some Major catching-up to do.

24:12.156 --> 24:13.681
Where have you been?

24:13.758 --> 24:15.920
I thought we were meeting
at the food court.

24:15.993 --> 24:18.087
That was like four texts ago.
Come on!

24:18.162 --> 24:21.963
My texts-per-minute
average was extremely subpar.

24:22.033 --> 24:25.026
I had about 200 completely
unacceptable photos of myself

24:25.102 --> 24:26.570
Tagged on Facebook.

24:26.637 --> 24:28.230
Ooh. Fat face.
De-Tag.

24:28.306 --> 24:32.004
De-Tag. De-Tag.
De-Tag!

24:32.076 --> 24:35.308
Oh, my god. De-friend
whoever put that one up!

24:35.580 --> 24:37.208
And I was about three months behind

24:37.281 --> 24:38.715
On all of the latest abbreves.

24:38.783 --> 24:39.910
Incredsies.

24:39.984 --> 24:41.213
Ugh, fug, in the good way.

24:41.285 --> 24:43.811
Ohh! This one is tally
"feroshe"-balls.

24:43.888 --> 24:45.186
"Feroshe"-balls?

24:45.256 --> 24:47.191
That's what we're calling it.

24:47.258 --> 24:48.556
Here, sweetie.

24:48.626 --> 24:52.763
<i>♪ Since we found out ♪</i>

24:52.830 --> 24:55.061
One, two, three.

24:55.132 --> 24:58.795

24:58.869 --> 25:00.895
Oh, my god.

25:00.972 --> 25:02.133
Praising the leather god.

25:02.206 --> 25:06.276
<i>♪ Anything can happen ♪</i>

25:06.344 --> 25:08.176
<i>♪ Anything can ♪</i>

25:10.348 --> 25:13.318
How do we look together?

25:17.188 --> 25:19.919
I love it!

25:24.195 --> 25:27.825
It was a straight-up
makeover-Montage situation,

25:27.898 --> 25:29.298
And all I could think of
was how much Brent

25:29.367 --> 25:32.599
Would have lived
for every second of it.

25:36.340 --> 25:40.971
<i>♪ I guess we thought
that's just what humans do ♪</i>

25:41.045 --> 25:44.379
With Brent, Sophie, and Glenn,
it was always so easy.

25:44.649 --> 25:47.141
I never worked so hard
just to have friends.

25:47.218 --> 25:49.653
But without Fawcett
and the other clique queens

25:49.720 --> 25:53.714
Watching my back,
I was a sitting duck.

25:53.791 --> 25:55.851
<i>♪ But now I've seen it through ♪</i>

25:55.926 --> 25:57.827
Good morning, ladies.
Hey.

25:57.895 --> 25:59.158
So, you speak to traitor...

25:59.230 --> 26:01.131
Excuse me, I mean Tanner...
This weekend?

26:01.198 --> 26:02.826
Well, no, actually.

26:02.900 --> 26:06.302
I called him like 50 times,
and no responses.

26:06.370 --> 26:09.204
You two really need to work it
out. I mean, it's like...

26:09.273 --> 26:11.071
Uh, ladies...

26:11.142 --> 26:12.633

26:30.294 --> 26:32.763
He united them.
I can't believe this.

26:32.830 --> 26:36.426
I can't believe
how tight his pants are.

26:36.701 --> 26:38.761
And is he wearing bronzer?

26:38.836 --> 26:42.329
He's spray-Tanner now.

26:42.406 --> 26:44.170
Before,
I could move through this school

26:44.241 --> 26:45.869
Unnoticed, invisible.

26:45.943 --> 26:50.938
But as the G.B.F., Well,
I was kind of indestructible.

26:51.015 --> 26:54.179
The up-close view of 'topher,
'Shley's hot Mormon boyfriend,

26:54.251 --> 26:56.117
Wasn't bad, either.

26:56.187 --> 27:02.218
For once, I was actually
kind of enjoying the spotlight.

27:04.428 --> 27:07.091
What do you think
you're doing with that...

27:07.164 --> 27:08.962
That ho... Ho... Ho...

27:09.033 --> 27:11.434
Ho-ho?
This is a Twinkie.

27:11.502 --> 27:13.232
Homosexual.

27:13.304 --> 27:15.330
I'm talking
about that other Twinkie,

27:15.406 --> 27:17.841
Your new apparent B.F.F.

27:17.908 --> 27:19.706
Tanner?
He's super nice, actually.

27:19.777 --> 27:21.370
Like not pure evil at all, really.

27:21.445 --> 27:23.471
I mean, maybe we're wrong.

27:23.748 --> 27:27.014
'Shley, this is not god's plan.

27:27.084 --> 27:28.450
I think that means "time-out."

27:28.519 --> 27:30.852
This is part of the polygamists'
plot, isn't it?

27:30.921 --> 27:33.390
The pastor always said
it's a slippery slope.

27:33.457 --> 27:35.858
First come the gays.
Then next thing we know,

27:35.926 --> 27:38.486
You people will want multiple
sister-wife prom dates.

27:38.763 --> 27:40.732
Well, I'm taking a stand.

27:40.798 --> 27:43.358
Consider this my resignation
from the O-M-G club.

27:43.434 --> 27:45.164
I can't be a part of a group

27:45.236 --> 27:47.262
Whose leader is in league
with sodomites.

27:49.907 --> 27:51.341
What's a sodomite?

27:51.408 --> 27:55.243
I think it's like dust mite,
but with sod.

27:55.312 --> 27:56.940
Oh.

27:57.014 --> 28:00.979
In times of crisis, I turn to Lilo.

28:03.554 --> 28:07.150
I mean, I know he's angry at me,
but, like...

28:08.526 --> 28:11.018
how could he do this?

28:11.095 --> 28:12.461
Tanner's just doing his best

28:12.530 --> 28:14.294
Trying not to get his ass kicked.

28:14.365 --> 28:15.765
I mean, aren't we all?

28:15.833 --> 28:17.825
I'm not letting him off that easy.

28:17.902 --> 28:21.066
This literally could
not get any worse.

28:21.138 --> 28:24.939
Actually, it can.

28:27.211 --> 28:29.271
You know how the paper

28:29.346 --> 28:31.406
Has its prom-court
preview issue coming up?

28:31.482 --> 28:32.882
Yeah.

28:32.950 --> 28:36.045
I got a proof.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.021
Tanner is the undisputed
front-runner

28:38.088 --> 28:39.351
For prom king this year.

28:42.393 --> 28:44.953
And it's...
It's not even close, really.

28:45.029 --> 28:47.089
What offends me more than anything

28:47.164 --> 28:49.360
Is the hypocrisy
and sexism of it all.

28:49.433 --> 28:51.197
If I were to come out as a lesbian,

28:51.268 --> 28:53.362
Would I all of a sudden be
a top candidate for prom queen?

28:53.437 --> 28:54.564
I think not.

28:54.839 --> 28:57.331
Congratulations, your Majesty.

28:57.408 --> 28:59.877
This has got to be a joke.
Oh, it's no joke.

28:59.944 --> 29:01.105
You're pretty much a lock.

29:01.178 --> 29:02.806
Yeah, you've got all our votes.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.840
And the votes of our various
minions and mini-mes.

29:04.882 --> 29:07.215
As for queen, they've got us
in a three-way.

29:07.284 --> 29:10.186
Tie, that is.
Most kids are undecided.

29:10.254 --> 29:12.450
They're waiting for you
to tell them what to think.

29:12.523 --> 29:14.389
Me?!
Everyone knows that 'mos

29:14.458 --> 29:17.292
Are always way ahead of
what's hot and what's so not.

29:17.361 --> 29:19.330
Well, on a completely
unrelated topic,

29:19.396 --> 29:21.092
I made you a batch of my famous

29:21.165 --> 29:22.997
Brigham yum-yum double fudge
brownies last night.

29:23.067 --> 29:25.559
'Shley, are you special?
Gays don't do carbs.

29:25.636 --> 29:29.937
Yeah, a carb to a 'mo is
like sunlight to a vampire.

29:30.007 --> 29:34.138
Carbs make gay people sparkle?

29:34.211 --> 29:36.077
So, I'm thinking maybe
we should hang out

29:36.146 --> 29:38.206
Just the two of us tonight,
sans "C" and 'Shley.

29:38.282 --> 29:40.046
Will they be cool with that?

29:40.117 --> 29:43.178
Those bitches can suck it.
I'm so over sharing you.

29:44.455 --> 29:48.984
Psst. Um, psst. Hey.

29:49.059 --> 29:51.426
Soledad.
Remember me?

29:51.495 --> 29:52.895
How could I forget?

29:52.963 --> 29:54.864
This is an "a" and gay
conversation,

29:54.932 --> 29:57.026
So kindly see your next
Tuesday out of it.

29:57.101 --> 30:01.232
Um, well, Tanner,
I just wanted to let you know

30:01.305 --> 30:03.365
That there's a G.S.A. Meeting
after school, so I thought...

30:03.440 --> 30:06.035
He doesn't want to join your
little fag-hag training club.

30:06.110 --> 30:08.045
That is a highly inflammatory term.

30:08.112 --> 30:10.877
I mean, Soledad, you did out
me to the entire school.

30:10.948 --> 30:12.917
Think of all the other
gay kids at this school

30:12.983 --> 30:14.584
That are still languishing
in the closet.

30:14.652 --> 30:17.588
You could be a real
role model for them.

30:19.957 --> 30:22.586
That's not my problem.

30:26.063 --> 30:28.623
Hey, so, we heard a vicious rumor

30:28.699 --> 30:31.191
That Fawcett's snagged you
all to herself after school?

30:31.268 --> 30:32.600
Word travels fast.

30:32.670 --> 30:34.332
Well, if that's how
we're gonna play it,

30:34.405 --> 30:35.805
I'm calling you after school Friday

30:35.940 --> 30:37.203
For one-on-one audition prep.

30:37.274 --> 30:39.140
We're gonna turn the shiz
out of "The Wiz."

30:39.209 --> 30:40.507
And Thursday you're all mine.

30:40.577 --> 30:42.341
'Topher and I are
gonna cook you din-din.

30:42.413 --> 30:45.042
Fawcett had made her move,
but it looked like

30:45.115 --> 30:47.482
The other queens weren't
going down without a fight.

30:47.551 --> 30:49.520
And then Friday night
is Cameron woods' party.

30:49.586 --> 30:52.215
We'll all be there, including
'Shley for some reason.

30:52.289 --> 30:55.453
I'm bringing enough diet,
caffeine-free ginger ale for everybody.

30:55.526 --> 30:59.019
Wow. Well, I guess my week's
planned out, then.

30:59.096 --> 31:02.123
Mm-hmm. We've so got you
booked, bitch. Boom.

31:05.469 --> 31:08.337
Wow.
This really works.

31:08.405 --> 31:09.685
Or did you prefer the other one?

31:09.740 --> 31:11.936
I'm really not very good at this.

31:12.009 --> 31:14.672
Tanner, I don't actually think

31:14.745 --> 31:16.611
That gays have a heightened
sense of fashion.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.478
I'm just asking you
to look at two options

31:18.549 --> 31:19.983
And choose the one you prefer.

31:20.050 --> 31:22.281
I like the one from before.

31:22.353 --> 31:24.584
Those kind of give you
'90s mom ass.

31:24.655 --> 31:26.521
Ah, thank you!
That is just the kind

31:26.590 --> 31:28.525
Of bitchy gay insight
I'm looking for.

31:28.592 --> 31:30.959
So, the bitchier I am,
the more you'll like me?

31:31.028 --> 31:33.725
Exactly.
But don't push it.

31:36.133 --> 31:38.125
You sure have a lot of stuff.

31:38.202 --> 31:39.727
I know.
Don't you love?

31:40.004 --> 31:42.439
I kind of have a thing
for labels...

31:42.506 --> 31:44.737
Chanel, Versace,

31:45.009 --> 31:47.672
Gay, fiercely fabulous.

31:47.745 --> 31:49.714
That's kind of like
your new comic strips.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.646
Books.
Whatevs.

31:51.715 --> 31:54.150
I'd much rather say hello
to a new handbag

31:54.218 --> 31:56.278
Than a friend or boyfriend.

31:56.353 --> 31:58.345
And they're much easier to return.

31:58.422 --> 32:00.584
Is that why you and Hamilton
broke up?

32:00.657 --> 32:03.286
Now, he is someone

32:03.360 --> 32:06.262
Who doesn't understand
the value of a label.

32:06.330 --> 32:08.526
Somehow me being
his "girlfriend" meant

32:08.599 --> 32:11.194
The whole cheerleading squad
suddenly became

32:11.268 --> 32:13.100
His own personal hookup harem.

32:13.170 --> 32:15.264
Gross.

32:15.339 --> 32:17.467
But now I've got you, bitch.

32:18.809 --> 32:20.607
Seriously, though.

32:20.677 --> 32:23.511
I feel like I can be myself
around you, you know?

32:23.580 --> 32:26.049
You're not trying to
screw me like a guy

32:26.116 --> 32:28.676
Or threatened by me like
every other girl in school.

32:28.752 --> 32:32.689
I guess that's the appeal
of this whole G.B.F. Thing.

32:32.756 --> 32:35.191
Not sure what I get out of it.

32:35.259 --> 32:38.127
Duh... you get to hang out with me.

32:41.465 --> 32:45.163
Okay, um...

32:45.235 --> 32:47.036
I could help you with
your chemistry homework.

32:47.071 --> 32:49.370
You're getting a "C," right?

32:49.440 --> 32:51.204
Mm.

32:51.275 --> 32:53.335
I'm actually kind of brills when
it comes to science-y stuff.

32:53.410 --> 32:55.072
Really?

32:56.580 --> 32:57.741
Can you keep a secret?

33:00.217 --> 33:04.655
Okay, my hair
is only 99.9% flawless.

33:04.721 --> 33:08.488
I mix all of my own hair serums
and conditioners in here.

33:08.559 --> 33:10.619
I'll have my own hair-care
line one day

33:10.694 --> 33:14.654
On, like, QVC or something,
finally make it big.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.131
That's when I realized

33:16.200 --> 33:18.362
Fawcett was more than just popular.

33:18.435 --> 33:20.427
She was actually kind of cool.

33:20.504 --> 33:24.339
Conversions.
This is easy.

33:26.143 --> 33:28.078
I know you and Tanner
had a falling out,

33:28.145 --> 33:30.341
But you're taking it
kind of literally.

33:30.414 --> 33:33.248
Yeah, well, my life is over.
So, thanks.

33:33.317 --> 33:36.651
Oh, come on, man. I mean,
you still got the two of us.

33:36.720 --> 33:41.454
For about 10 minutes. I never
RSVP to a nonstop pity party.

33:41.525 --> 33:44.586
So, I'm bound to eternity in
Loserland with you two. Great.

33:44.661 --> 33:46.323
That's a little harsh.

33:46.396 --> 33:48.763
And here I thought we were
all doing pretty okay,

33:48.832 --> 33:50.733
But I guess
we aren't sparkly enough

33:50.801 --> 33:53.396
Or have enough synthetic
hair extensions for you.

33:53.470 --> 33:55.110
Oh, my god, Sophie.
You know what I meant.

33:55.139 --> 33:56.334
No. You know what?

33:56.406 --> 33:58.375
Why don't we take a few days apart,

33:58.442 --> 34:01.241
Maybe without a couple losers
like us hanging around?

34:01.311 --> 34:03.871
You'll ascend to your
proper social station.

34:04.148 --> 34:06.640
Just be careful, though,
because we might not be here

34:06.717 --> 34:08.652
To bandage you up
next time you fall.

34:08.719 --> 34:10.119
Come on, Glenn.

34:10.187 --> 34:11.485
Sophie!

34:11.554 --> 34:14.889
Um, yeah.
Take it easy, bro.

34:15.159 --> 34:18.721
Glenn. Come on.
We were gonna watch "the voice."

34:22.366 --> 34:23.891
As the wheels
seemed to be coming off

34:24.168 --> 34:26.262
My old friend group, the next day,

34:26.335 --> 34:28.828
I was third-wheeling it,
Mormon-style.

34:28.906 --> 34:31.670
Wow. This is a whole lot
of meat, 'Shley.

34:31.742 --> 34:35.543
Well, that's what you like,
isn't it? Meat.

34:35.612 --> 34:37.274
Huh?

34:37.347 --> 34:39.543
No carbs.
I remembered.

34:39.616 --> 34:43.917
Oh, right.
Uh, mmm, meats with...

34:44.188 --> 34:48.353
sides of meats.

34:48.425 --> 34:52.328
Um, may I use the restroom?

34:58.735 --> 35:00.601
Whoa!
What are you doing?!

35:00.671 --> 35:03.266
Girl-talk time.
So, what do you think?

35:03.340 --> 35:05.639
Think about what?
'Topher.

35:05.709 --> 35:07.575
Do you think he's bored
with our relationship?

35:07.644 --> 35:08.737
I feel like he's bored.

35:08.812 --> 35:10.405
Um, I don't know.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.814
I'm worried because
we don't, you know...

35:13.884 --> 35:16.513
so I need some tips.
Tips?

35:16.587 --> 35:19.284
You gays are supposed to be experts
in man pleasing. So, spill.

35:19.356 --> 35:21.655
Uh...
do you think I should give him a B.J.?

35:21.725 --> 35:23.523
A what?!
Or an H.J.?

35:23.594 --> 35:24.755
Or how about an R.J.?

35:24.828 --> 35:27.559
Uh... I don't even know

35:27.631 --> 35:29.361
What an R.J. Could possibly be.

35:29.433 --> 35:32.767
Ugh. Me neither.
I was hoping you would.

35:32.836 --> 35:34.862
Are Mormons even allowed to...
What about backdoor?

35:34.938 --> 35:36.873
Oh, my god!
Tanner, honey.

35:36.940 --> 35:39.273
Please do not take the lord's
name in vain in my house.

35:39.343 --> 35:41.869
I'm sorry.
I actually did have to pee.

35:41.945 --> 35:44.676
Could we, uh, talk later?

35:44.748 --> 35:48.879
Fine, but you owe me girl-talk
time, mister, okay?

35:54.391 --> 35:56.917
Oh, Tanner, I am so, so sorry.

35:56.994 --> 35:58.462
'Topher just reminded me I have

35:58.528 --> 36:00.258
A junior republicans meeting
in like 20 minutes.

36:00.330 --> 36:01.696
Do you mind if 'tophie
takes you home?

36:01.765 --> 36:05.861
Um, s-sure, I guess.

36:18.515 --> 36:21.007
'Topher, this isn't my house.

36:21.285 --> 36:24.585
I know.
I just wanted to talk. Okay.

36:24.655 --> 36:26.351
You know, I've caught
you checking me out.

36:26.423 --> 36:28.823
Please don't beat me up! I'm so
sorry! It won't happen again!

36:28.859 --> 36:30.885
Whoa, dude.
Whew! Relax.

36:30.961 --> 36:34.591
I find it kind of flattering.

36:34.665 --> 36:38.363
So, what do you like
most about me, huh?

36:38.435 --> 36:42.497
What's my sexiest quality?

36:42.572 --> 36:44.768
Oh, I get it. You're one
of those straight guys

36:44.841 --> 36:47.538
Who likes to flirt with gay
guys for your own amusement.

36:47.611 --> 36:49.580
No, Tanner, that's actually not...
You know what?

36:49.646 --> 36:51.342
Contrary to what you might believe,

36:51.415 --> 36:54.510
We homos don't all sit around
pining for straight boys, okay?

36:54.584 --> 36:56.485
Some of us like the idea of a guy

36:56.553 --> 36:58.749
Actually being turned on by us.

36:58.822 --> 37:02.987
Does this feel straight to you?

37:03.060 --> 37:05.894
Um, it does, actually.

37:07.064 --> 37:09.533
You Mormons are a horny,
repressed people!

37:09.599 --> 37:10.897
You have no idea.

37:10.967 --> 37:13.835
Mnh! Wait! This is wrong.
You're with 'Shley.

37:13.904 --> 37:16.874
Dude, in two years,
I'm gonna go on my mission.

37:16.940 --> 37:18.909
In four years,
I'll probably be married

37:18.975 --> 37:21.501
With a bunch of redheaded
Rugrats running around.

37:21.578 --> 37:24.412
So, why don't you just sit back...

37:24.481 --> 37:27.849
relax...

37:27.918 --> 37:30.717
and let me get this
out of my system?

37:34.725 --> 37:36.694
Ooh.

37:36.760 --> 37:37.784
You okay?

37:37.861 --> 37:40.092
Uh, t-thanks.
I'll walk.

38:06.089 --> 38:08.456
So, I have some news for you.

38:08.525 --> 38:10.391
It's pretty Maj.
What?

38:10.460 --> 38:12.429
I may have snatched you
a prom date.

38:12.496 --> 38:14.089
His name is Christian.

38:14.164 --> 38:16.429
He went to theater camp
with me last summer.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.935
He's a tenor, a college boy,
and he's British.

38:19.002 --> 38:20.664
Love it?

38:20.737 --> 38:22.569
He sounds great.

38:22.639 --> 38:25.803
I'm just not sure if this
whole prom thing is for me.

38:25.876 --> 38:29.506
Okay. You're losing yourself.
Come with mama.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.744
Take a look, Tanner.

38:33.817 --> 38:37.413
This is every prom king
and queen since 1983.

38:37.487 --> 38:39.046
You notice anything?

38:39.122 --> 38:41.387
Not the most diverse selection.

38:41.458 --> 38:43.950
Huh.
All white, all straight,

38:44.027 --> 38:46.792
All jocks and pom-pom wranglers.

38:46.863 --> 38:50.027
Tanner, we could be the
ones to change all that.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.695
You could be the first
openly gay prom king

38:52.769 --> 38:54.670
And enjoy a hot date to boot,

38:54.738 --> 38:56.570
And I can be the first queen

38:56.640 --> 38:59.075
Who's actually deserving
of any notoriety.

38:59.142 --> 39:01.771
So, what do you say?

39:01.845 --> 39:03.643
I get you laid.
You get me crowned.

39:03.713 --> 39:05.079
You can lose that virginity

39:05.148 --> 39:06.912
Before you snatch up that diploma.

39:06.983 --> 39:08.884
Caprice, just because you
know another gay guy

39:08.952 --> 39:10.545
Doesn't mean I...

39:10.620 --> 39:13.886
Whoa! He's...
very attractive.

39:13.957 --> 39:15.619
Those lips.

39:15.692 --> 39:18.890
Mm-hmm. That's what we call
some high-speed DSLs.

39:18.962 --> 39:21.693
So?

39:21.765 --> 39:24.166
I'll... think about it.
Perf!

39:24.234 --> 39:26.100
I'm gonna invite him
to Cameron's tonight

39:26.169 --> 39:27.933
So you two can get
to know each other.

39:28.004 --> 39:29.597
Crap. I forgot that was tonight.

39:29.673 --> 39:31.733
Oh, relax.
It's gonna be "V" low-key.

39:35.579 --> 39:37.639
Everyone can relax.

39:37.714 --> 39:40.707
The people who matter have arrived.

39:43.553 --> 39:45.021
I'm gonna go see
if Christian's here.

39:45.088 --> 39:46.886
Ooh.
There are Christians here?

39:46.957 --> 39:49.620
Get your gay game face on.

39:49.693 --> 39:51.894
After tonight, you'll have
the prom date of your dreams.

39:51.895 --> 39:53.727
Oh.

39:53.797 --> 39:56.699
So, Caprice reeled you
in some Mangina, huh?

39:56.766 --> 39:58.792
Well played.
I guess.

39:58.869 --> 40:01.634
I mean, I don't even know
if he'll like me.

40:01.705 --> 40:03.901
Sounds like you need
some liquid courage.

40:03.974 --> 40:05.135
Follow me.

40:05.208 --> 40:07.768
Oh. Come on.

40:07.844 --> 40:11.144
You call this an ensemble?
Get it together, girl.

40:11.214 --> 40:13.809
Do not call me that.

40:13.884 --> 40:16.877
Wh-why? I meant, like,
"gurl" with a "u."

40:16.953 --> 40:18.785
Gurl!

40:18.855 --> 40:22.087
Not like you're a...
Oh, okay.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.127
Um, so, hey,
why don't we dust this off

40:24.194 --> 40:27.062
And you take me to the mall
and pick me out some eye shadow,

40:27.130 --> 40:28.689
Just like the old days, huh?

40:28.765 --> 40:30.563
You're so good with color.

40:30.634 --> 40:32.865
Yeah, I don't think
I'm leaving the house

40:32.936 --> 40:34.598
Till college, but, thanks.

40:34.671 --> 40:37.539
Oh, "b" boo.

40:37.607 --> 40:39.735
Listen. I get it.
I really do.

40:39.809 --> 40:43.246
With what happened with Tanner,
I know that you didn't

40:43.313 --> 40:46.772
Get to come out to me in the
way that you wanted to.

40:46.850 --> 40:49.718
We didn't get to have
our extra-special

40:49.786 --> 40:52.187
Mother/son lifetime movie moment.

40:52.255 --> 40:54.281
I know that.

40:54.558 --> 40:56.720
You don't want to go out
tonight, right?

40:56.793 --> 40:59.661
I got a plan "b"!

40:59.729 --> 41:02.597
Did you know that WebFlix

41:02.666 --> 41:05.067
Has an entire
gay and lesbian section?

41:05.135 --> 41:06.728
Blew my mind.

41:06.803 --> 41:09.932
Okay, "milk." I got "milk."
It's about a gay mayor.

41:10.006 --> 41:12.874
"Boys don't cry"...Now, this is
girl that wants to be a boy.

41:12.943 --> 41:14.844
That's a tricky one.

41:14.911 --> 41:17.210
"Brokeback Mountain"...
That's the cowboys.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.647
And something called "shortballs"...

41:19.716 --> 41:22.015
Oh, "shortbus."
"Shortbus."

41:22.085 --> 41:24.987
So, which one do you want
to pop in first, huh?

41:25.055 --> 41:28.048
Probably the cowboys, right?
That one's safe.

41:28.124 --> 41:31.253
Someone drank all my ginger ales.

41:31.328 --> 41:33.763
Hey, do you know
if there's caffeine/alcohol

41:33.830 --> 41:35.594
In a chica loca?

41:35.665 --> 41:37.634
No, 'Shley, of course not.

41:37.701 --> 41:39.294
Chug away.

41:41.171 --> 41:43.163
This was a bad idea.

41:43.239 --> 41:45.174
There is no getting cold feet now.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.971
We have got to rescue Tanner

41:47.043 --> 41:49.171
From those gay-snatching
fashion Nazis.

41:49.245 --> 41:53.012
Divide and conquer.

41:53.083 --> 41:55.609
Hey, sexy.

41:55.685 --> 41:58.849
Don't think me presumptuous
when I say "bottoms up."

42:00.724 --> 42:03.819
Ugh.
This tastes like ass.

42:03.893 --> 42:05.225
Mm-hmm.
Perfect for you.

42:05.295 --> 42:06.627
Funny.

42:06.696 --> 42:08.358
Loosen up.
I hear that's helpful.

42:08.632 --> 42:09.998
There you go.

42:10.066 --> 42:11.659
Look, don't let Caprice
pressure you.

42:11.735 --> 42:13.655
If you're really that nervous,
then just blow off

42:13.670 --> 42:16.731
Blowing what's his name and
come to prom as my arm candy.

42:16.806 --> 42:18.638
It might be kind of cool to, like,

42:18.708 --> 42:20.609
Actually go on a date or something.

42:20.677 --> 42:26.082
P.S... This one can
has over 600 calories.

42:26.149 --> 42:28.744
I thought carbs were like
gay kryptonite or something.

42:28.818 --> 42:30.946
Alcohol is the one exception. Duh.

42:31.021 --> 42:32.751
Now down it, bitch.

42:32.822 --> 42:34.882
Whoo!

42:34.958 --> 42:37.325
Well, it's just
freezing cold out there.

42:37.394 --> 42:39.829
Heath!
Don't stand on your pride.

42:39.896 --> 42:43.298
Get in the tent with Jake!
For crying out loud.

42:43.366 --> 42:45.392
Good. Get in there.
Snuggle up.

42:45.669 --> 42:47.900
Snuggle up for warmth.
There you go.

42:47.971 --> 42:50.304
Oh. Looks like
they're waking back up.

42:50.373 --> 42:54.868
Uh-oh.
Here we go. Game on.

42:54.944 --> 42:57.345
You know, I do sense
an affection there.

42:57.414 --> 43:00.384
I mean, you really do feel
they care about one another.

43:00.450 --> 43:03.420
Oh, my. Well, yeah.

43:03.687 --> 43:07.021
I guess necessity
is the mother of invention.

43:07.090 --> 43:09.389
I mean...

43:09.459 --> 43:11.121
you know, it's funny.
I guess back then

43:11.194 --> 43:13.163
They didn't even need to use
protection, really, right?

43:13.229 --> 43:15.095
You know, I'm gonna get a drink.

43:15.165 --> 43:17.657
They could have made
something out of like a...

43:17.734 --> 43:19.669
Some kind of lamb skin
or something,

43:19.736 --> 43:22.137
But there probably
wasn't time for that.

43:22.205 --> 43:24.800
A few hours and a lot
of drinks later,

43:24.874 --> 43:28.106
I was getting all the
frequently asked questions.

43:28.178 --> 43:32.115
So, with straight guys,
there's ass men and tit men,

43:32.182 --> 43:34.151
But what's the gay equivalent?

43:34.217 --> 43:36.015
Like, ball men?

43:36.086 --> 43:38.351
When you're getting gay with a guy,

43:38.421 --> 43:42.153
How do you decide who's the girl
and who's the boy?

43:42.225 --> 43:45.684
Not an expert, but I think
you're both the boy.

43:45.762 --> 43:47.856
That's kind of the point.

43:47.931 --> 43:49.297
Just Wiki that shit, freak.

43:49.365 --> 43:50.856
Leave him alone.

43:50.934 --> 43:52.835
Come on, slut.
You owe me a dance.

43:54.738 --> 43:57.207
<i>♪ You do your body work ♪</i>

43:57.273 --> 44:00.004
<i>♪ I feel my pulse
working overtime ♪</i>

44:00.076 --> 44:01.942
Oh, my god!
Sorry.

44:02.011 --> 44:03.309
<i>♪ You do your body work ♪</i>

44:04.881 --> 44:07.077
Oh. Sorry.

44:07.150 --> 44:09.278
Oh, you guys, I found you!

44:09.352 --> 44:11.014
Hi!

44:11.087 --> 44:13.113
'Shley.
Hi.

44:13.189 --> 44:14.189
Hi.
Hi.

44:14.257 --> 44:17.489
Hi and bye.

44:17.761 --> 44:21.027
Is it just me, or is she,
like, the worst Mormon ever?

44:21.097 --> 44:23.862
It's so not just you.
She's cray-cray.

44:23.933 --> 44:27.802
Hey! You!
Gaysian boy, come here.

44:27.871 --> 44:30.136
Ew. Get out.

44:30.206 --> 44:32.072
We're having
gay-guy/girl gab time.

44:32.142 --> 44:34.407
Seriously?
Oh, my god.

44:34.477 --> 44:36.912
There's a bean bag
in the other... Let's go.

44:36.980 --> 44:38.278
Sorry about this.
I can't wait.

44:38.348 --> 44:40.010
Really sorry.
God. Bitch.

44:40.083 --> 44:43.952
So, your friend Tanner won't
tell me anything about the J's.

44:44.020 --> 44:45.147
The... The who?

44:45.221 --> 44:47.156
The... The H.J.s
and the B.J.s,

44:47.223 --> 44:49.055
Pretty much any of the J's.

44:49.125 --> 44:51.924
But I've got an idea.

44:51.995 --> 44:53.964
You are gonna show me how.

44:54.030 --> 44:57.330
And it's not gonna count because
you're like supes gay-mosexual.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.336
Uh, yeah, right.
Shh!

45:00.403 --> 45:03.999
Just pretend I'm, like,
some super-hot guy,

45:04.073 --> 45:06.941
Like David Archuleta.

45:07.010 --> 45:08.808
Oh, David Archuleta?
David, don't you worry.

45:08.878 --> 45:11.905
I'm gonna teach you all about
the H.J.s and the B.J.s

45:11.981 --> 45:14.314
And the Jay-Zs and the J.J. Abrams.

45:14.384 --> 45:16.853
No, wait. Hold on.

45:16.920 --> 45:19.355
You're drunk, plus, you're Mormon,

45:19.422 --> 45:21.516
Which, like, totally exacerbates
the whole being drunk thing.

45:21.591 --> 45:23.492
"Exasturbates."

45:23.560 --> 45:25.324
That's a funny word.

45:25.395 --> 45:27.296
Yeah.

45:27.363 --> 45:29.559
Yeah, anyway,
I'm... I'm not even...

45:29.833 --> 45:30.926
What?

45:31.000 --> 45:32.093
Gay.

45:32.168 --> 45:33.898
Prove it, Gaysian.

45:39.108 --> 45:40.974
Look who I found!

45:41.044 --> 45:44.173
Sorry. Oh, hi.

45:44.247 --> 45:45.909
You must be...

45:45.982 --> 45:47.974
Christian. Hello, Tanner.

45:48.051 --> 45:49.451
Even better in real life, right?

45:49.519 --> 45:51.420
Even better with beer goggles,
she means.

45:51.487 --> 45:53.319
Don't touch me.

45:53.389 --> 45:55.290
Damn, you are pretty.

45:55.358 --> 45:58.089
I mean handsome.
I mean pretty handsome.

45:58.161 --> 46:02.326
'Sup, bro?

46:02.398 --> 46:05.334
He's usually less special.

46:05.401 --> 46:07.961
Do you maybe want a glass
of water or something, mate?

46:08.037 --> 46:10.973
Oh, hi, there. I hate
to break up this little...

46:11.040 --> 46:13.134
whatever this is,
but I need to talk to Tanner.

46:13.209 --> 46:15.041
Tanner can't talk right now,
and he and Christian

46:15.111 --> 46:16.579
Were about to have
a private moment alone.

46:16.646 --> 46:18.726
Caprice, I really think
we got off on the wrong foot.

46:18.882 --> 46:20.373
Yo, 'topher, welcome to the casa.

46:20.450 --> 46:22.544
Thank you. Hey, is Tanner here?
I mean 'Shley.

46:22.619 --> 46:24.952
Is 'Shley here?
She's my girlfriend. Love her.

46:25.021 --> 46:26.182
Yeah.
She's in the back.

46:26.256 --> 46:27.884
Okay. Thank you.
All right.

46:31.294 --> 46:32.853
Hey, Glenn.

46:32.929 --> 46:35.091
Oh, my god.
Ew, 'Shley.

46:35.164 --> 46:37.190
Glenn, you really are straight?

46:37.267 --> 46:41.398
No, no, he's totes not.
So it doesn't count. Right?

46:41.471 --> 46:42.939
Oh, Jesus Christ.

46:43.006 --> 46:44.975
Caprice, watch your mouth, please.

46:45.041 --> 46:46.509
I could say the same for you,
"whore-mon."

46:46.576 --> 46:48.169
I think I have to barf.

46:48.244 --> 46:50.179
I'll hold your hair.

46:51.581 --> 46:54.244
Hey, "T." Remember me?

47:00.290 --> 47:02.987
I just ripped it off.
I just had to because...

47:03.059 --> 47:07.622
Tan-pon, I heard you bulimed
cuisine all over a Mormon.

47:07.697 --> 47:09.495
I thought I told you

47:09.565 --> 47:11.557
To always drink
on an empty stomach.

47:11.634 --> 47:13.603
I'm gonna go.

47:13.670 --> 47:16.606
I'm kind of over
being the party's gay mascot

47:16.673 --> 47:19.108
And of publicly humiliating myself

47:19.175 --> 47:21.303
In front of potential dates.

47:21.377 --> 47:23.312
You want Mindie to drive you?

47:23.379 --> 47:25.371
Don't worry.
I'm totally sober.

47:27.250 --> 47:30.084
No, thanks.
I'll walk.

47:30.153 --> 47:33.021
Okay. Call me tomorrow.
Kisses. Mwah!

47:33.089 --> 47:36.059
Oh, my god, you totally made out
with your gay Bestie.

47:36.125 --> 47:38.458
No!

47:45.134 --> 47:48.036
Oh, um...

47:48.104 --> 47:51.632
I... am... drunk.

47:51.708 --> 47:54.177
Me too.

48:01.551 --> 48:04.350
What are you doing
in front of my house?

48:04.420 --> 48:06.548
I have no clue.

48:08.424 --> 48:10.689
Since I basically
have no friends left,

48:10.760 --> 48:14.595
My mom decided to have
a queer-movie marathon.

48:14.664 --> 48:17.691
But when we got to heath
and Jake grunting in a tent,

48:17.767 --> 48:19.531
I started drinking heavily.

48:23.439 --> 48:26.034
You walked all the way over here?

48:26.109 --> 48:27.737
Mm-hmm.

48:28.011 --> 48:31.038
I had this idea that I'd make
this grand entrance at the party

48:31.114 --> 48:34.175
And make a huge scene,
but this is as far as I got.

48:34.250 --> 48:36.014
Oops. Yeah.
I see.

48:36.085 --> 48:38.145
It's not fair!

48:38.221 --> 48:40.417
You get to be belle of the ball,

48:40.490 --> 48:43.460
And I'm stuck home
with mommy dearest.

48:43.526 --> 48:46.325
I'd trade places with you
in a second.

48:46.396 --> 48:48.388
Just...
Just do me a favor.

48:48.464 --> 48:50.057
Hmm?

48:50.133 --> 48:55.128
When you win prom king,
you'll make a big speech

48:55.204 --> 48:57.264
About, you know,
everything that you've learned,

48:57.340 --> 48:59.434
You know, very Lohan.

48:59.509 --> 49:03.674
Not really my style,
but... we'll see.

49:08.484 --> 49:10.316
Sorry.
Still picturing you

49:10.386 --> 49:13.379
Watching "brokeback" with your mom.

49:13.456 --> 49:14.788
It's not funny!

49:15.058 --> 49:17.118
I'm gonna have to emancipate
or something.

49:17.193 --> 49:18.354
She's driving me crazy.

49:18.428 --> 49:21.557
She's just being supportive.

49:21.631 --> 49:25.693
Maybe everyone secretly wants
a G.B.F.,

49:25.768 --> 49:28.169
Even moms.

49:31.474 --> 49:36.412
Right now I would just
settle for, like, a B.F.

49:39.115 --> 49:44.782
You mean like a best friend
or, like, boyfriend?

49:47.857 --> 49:50.258
Either/or...

49:50.326 --> 49:52.625
or both.

50:20.189 --> 50:22.715
Wait. What?

50:22.792 --> 50:24.522
Oh, my god, no, no.

50:24.594 --> 50:27.393
Did we...?
We didn't, right?

50:27.463 --> 50:29.261
You don't know?
Do you?

50:29.332 --> 50:31.267
No, no, no, no,
we... We... We came in,

50:31.334 --> 50:32.802
And we... We just...
We were drunk.

50:32.869 --> 50:34.235
We passed out, I think.

50:34.303 --> 50:36.238
Right. That sounds right.
Yeah.

50:36.305 --> 50:38.399
Closet! Now!

50:38.474 --> 50:39.567
Seriously? Oh!
Gah!

50:45.348 --> 50:46.839
Honey, what was that?

50:46.916 --> 50:49.715
Nothing.
I'm just cleaning up in here.

50:49.785 --> 50:52.721
Yeah, it does smell
kind of musky in here.

50:52.788 --> 50:56.384
So, I've got bubbling cinnabons
in the microwave

50:56.459 --> 50:57.825
And some chocolate milk for you.

50:57.894 --> 50:59.453
Super.
I'll be right there.

50:59.529 --> 51:01.293
Come on.

51:04.200 --> 51:05.566
Thanks for that.

51:05.635 --> 51:08.195
I'm sorry.
I'm just not ready.

51:08.271 --> 51:12.231
I don't even know what
I'm doing here. Ugh, god.

51:12.308 --> 51:14.504
Wait!
What?

51:14.577 --> 51:18.673
Could you, uh, just go that way?

51:18.748 --> 51:20.842
So, first you want
to put me back in the closet,

51:20.917 --> 51:22.909
And now you want me
to jump out your window?

51:23.186 --> 51:25.382
Yes.
Real nice, Tanner.

51:25.454 --> 51:26.922
I'll make it up to you.
I swear.

51:27.190 --> 51:28.783
Yeah, whatever.
It's fine. I get it.

Amazing news.

52:04.493 --> 52:07.361
Christian's willing to forget
about your projectile vomit

52:07.430 --> 52:09.456
And general Schwastedness
this weekend.

52:09.532 --> 52:11.398
He's still willing to go
to the prom with you.

52:11.467 --> 52:13.936
Really? Still?
Believe it, bitch.

52:14.003 --> 52:15.972
Apparently, you being
the only decent-looking,

52:16.239 --> 52:17.935
Age-appropriate gay guy
in a 20-mile radius

52:18.007 --> 52:20.772
Has given him a convenient case
of boner-induced amnesia.

52:20.843 --> 52:24.439
He really thinks
I'm decent-looking?

52:24.513 --> 52:25.640
Yeah.

52:25.715 --> 52:27.240
Just one condition...

52:27.316 --> 52:30.343
Lay off the cosmo-tini-ritas
on prom night, okay?

52:30.419 --> 52:32.285
That definitely won't be a problem.

52:32.355 --> 52:36.656
Yay! This is gonna be
so homo-doralbe!

52:36.726 --> 52:39.628
Come on, Tan-Tut.

52:39.695 --> 52:43.393
Thank you so much.

52:43.466 --> 52:46.300
I'd like to get
two tickets to prom.

52:46.369 --> 52:47.860
Oh, okay, then.

52:47.937 --> 52:50.634
Just write down
the name of your date here

52:50.706 --> 52:53.369
And also her school if she...
"He."

52:53.442 --> 52:54.842
Um, excuse me?

52:54.910 --> 52:57.345
He. He.
Something funny?

52:57.413 --> 52:58.779
No, "he,"as in "him,"

52:58.848 --> 53:02.717
Pronouns that describe my date,
who is a dude.

53:02.785 --> 53:04.981
Yikes. Sorry.
To get the couple's special,

53:05.054 --> 53:07.614
You need to be a traditional
boy/girl pairing.

53:07.690 --> 53:08.885
You want me to fight
this bitch, Tanner?

53:08.958 --> 53:10.722
Sorry, but that's just the policy.

53:10.793 --> 53:13.456
Tanner, I just want you to know
that I share your outrage.

53:13.529 --> 53:15.623
Now, what are we gonna do about this?
"We"?

53:15.698 --> 53:17.530
I just thought you could use
the G.S.A.'s help

53:17.600 --> 53:19.040
To right this
blatant discrimination.

53:19.068 --> 53:20.627
That's why our group exists.

53:20.703 --> 53:22.695
Please come to our meeting
after school.

53:22.772 --> 53:25.571
Thanks, "sole-hag," but
we can fight out own battles.

53:25.641 --> 53:27.371
This isn't over.

53:29.078 --> 53:33.448
It's just outrageous.
I mean, what is this... 2008?

53:33.516 --> 53:34.916
Okay, that's 20.
Give me 20 more.

53:34.984 --> 53:37.681
You want to stay a four-pack
queer forever? Let's go!

53:37.753 --> 53:38.914
McKenzie has a different take

53:38.988 --> 53:40.650
On the whole
"love thy neighbor" thing.

53:40.723 --> 53:42.487
Yeah, and apparently
you can't get enough

53:42.558 --> 53:44.424
Of that neighbor lovin'.

53:44.493 --> 53:46.826
McKenzie price is deceased,
socially, at this school.

53:46.896 --> 53:48.956
I've already got
the Facebook post composed.

53:49.031 --> 53:51.762
But that defeats the purpose.

53:51.834 --> 53:53.530
I think I'm gonna go

53:53.602 --> 53:55.503
To the G.S.A. Meeting after school.

53:56.739 --> 53:59.334
No. Soledad and her little group...

53:59.408 --> 54:01.400
It'll totally downgrade your rep.

54:01.477 --> 54:02.911
Plus, those busted bitches
were the ones

54:02.978 --> 54:04.469
That dragged you out of the closet.

54:04.547 --> 54:06.675
Remember?
You want my advices?

54:06.749 --> 54:08.615
Just buy the stag tickets
and get the "F" over it.

54:08.684 --> 54:10.983
Please don't tell me you're
seriously considering this.

54:11.053 --> 54:13.852
What have I got to lose?
I mean, they outed me,

54:13.923 --> 54:17.860
But at least their intentions
were kind of noble, I guess.

54:17.927 --> 54:20.954
And let me just say...
If you guys really claim to be my friends,

54:21.030 --> 54:22.555
You could focus a little less

54:22.631 --> 54:24.964
On how much I match your outfit
on any given day

54:25.034 --> 54:27.765
And show some concern
for my freaking equal rights!

54:27.837 --> 54:31.831
<i>♪ A-amazing, a-a-amazing ♪</i>

54:31.907 --> 54:35.036
P.S... Are my arms looking
Michelle Obama toned

54:35.111 --> 54:36.909
Or Madonna scary?

54:36.979 --> 54:39.975
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Have you heard about Tanner?

54:40.049 --> 54:42.985
What? What did... I didn't...
What did you hear?

54:43.052 --> 54:45.078
Well, apparently
he totally threw down

54:45.154 --> 54:46.918
With McKenzie price over prom.

54:46.989 --> 54:48.981
Yeah, he was all like, "I'm
gonna take a dude as my date,"

54:49.058 --> 54:50.778
And she was all like,
"oh, not on my watch,"

54:50.793 --> 54:52.386
And then he was all like,
"oh, yeah,

54:52.461 --> 54:53.827
We'll see about that,
you c-word-face mofo ho."

54:53.896 --> 54:58.061
Hold that, Wonton. Tanner
wants to ask a guy to prom?

54:58.134 --> 55:00.535
Yeah.
I have no idea who, though.

55:00.603 --> 55:02.731
Hey, maybe he met someone.

55:05.074 --> 55:07.509
No one I can think of.

55:07.576 --> 55:09.408
Me neither.

55:09.478 --> 55:10.844
See ya.

55:10.913 --> 55:12.973
First order of business,
G.S.A.'Ers...

55:13.048 --> 55:16.416
I'd like to introduce
our first actually gay member,

55:16.485 --> 55:18.647
Tanner Daniels!
Whoo!

55:18.721 --> 55:20.690
Welcome, bro dude.

55:20.756 --> 55:23.658
Good to have another member
with a member representin'.

55:23.726 --> 55:25.126
Uh, right. Well, I'm just here

55:25.194 --> 55:27.561
Because I was trying
to buy prom tickets, and...

55:27.630 --> 55:30.794
And he couldn't because
of our school's unjust,

55:30.866 --> 55:32.858
Totally outdated
prom-date policies.

55:32.935 --> 55:35.029
So, what are we
gonna do about this?

55:35.104 --> 55:36.504
"We"?

55:36.572 --> 55:38.939
Yeah.
I am joining the G.S.A.

55:39.008 --> 55:42.968
To support my G.B.F.
Move.

55:43.045 --> 55:44.741
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

55:44.814 --> 55:48.615
Um, Fawcett, thank you,
but, um, we're at capacity.

55:48.684 --> 55:50.414
So we don't really...

55:50.486 --> 55:54.048
Soledad, the G.S.A. Is open
to anyone who wants to join.

55:54.123 --> 55:57.116
But, Ms. Hoegel,
this is my thing, you know?

55:57.193 --> 55:59.594
She has things, lots of things,

55:59.662 --> 56:03.064
And she's trying to take
my... My, uh...

56:03.132 --> 56:04.794
she's...
Are you quite done?

56:06.101 --> 56:08.832
So, can we please just...
Just one moment, Fawcett.

56:08.904 --> 56:12.068
I've noticed some disturbing trends

56:12.141 --> 56:14.542
In this school as of late.

56:14.610 --> 56:17.739
It seems that many of you girls
are treating Tanner

56:17.813 --> 56:21.944
As more of a prize to be won
than an actual person.

56:22.017 --> 56:24.009
Ms. Hoegel, that's ridiculous.

56:24.086 --> 56:26.453
Right, "T"?

56:26.522 --> 56:29.617
Listen, girls.
I get the appeal.

56:29.692 --> 56:33.185
Now, I myself had
a gay best friend once and...

56:33.262 --> 56:37.165
Oh, we were roommates
for many fruitful years.

56:37.233 --> 56:42.001
But now he's no longer with us.

56:43.839 --> 56:45.569
Oh.

56:45.641 --> 56:47.735
Oh, damn.

56:47.810 --> 56:49.506
What?
Where'd he go?

56:49.578 --> 56:51.911
He obvi died of the HIV, dumbass.

56:51.981 --> 56:53.973
Oh, god, no!

56:54.049 --> 56:56.609
He moved to San Diego
with a leather queen.

56:56.685 --> 57:01.680
I meant myself and my cat...
Anderson coo-purr.

57:03.959 --> 57:05.655
Oh, my god.

57:05.728 --> 57:10.666
We're very happy,
Mr. Coo-purr and I.

57:10.733 --> 57:12.668
What are we gonna do
about this prom situation?

57:12.735 --> 57:14.727
If you can't take your boy toy
to prom,

57:14.803 --> 57:16.635
I will lead a school-wide boycott,

57:16.705 --> 57:22.110
And if they don't meet my...
I mean our... Demands

57:22.177 --> 57:26.945
Then I will just host my own
cooler alterna-prom.

57:27.016 --> 57:28.985
Fawcett, you'd do that?

57:29.051 --> 57:32.920
I mean, prom's your night.
You're a shoe-in for prom queen.

57:32.988 --> 57:35.958
Come on. What's the point
of being queen

57:36.025 --> 57:38.688
When I don't have a fabulous
king to share it with?

57:38.761 --> 57:41.287
You know what, Soledad?

57:41.564 --> 57:43.692
You have done such a great job
with this group,

57:43.766 --> 57:45.962
But I think it's time
that some things

57:46.035 --> 57:47.697
Actually changed
around this school.

57:47.770 --> 57:51.229
Who's with me?
Whoo!

57:55.978 --> 57:57.640
Hey, Tanner, looking good.

57:57.713 --> 57:59.011
Hey. Thanks.

57:59.081 --> 58:00.572
Ugh!
W-T-F, "T"?

58:00.649 --> 58:02.880
I secure you a date
with the hottest teen homo

58:02.952 --> 58:05.148
In the Tri-State area,
and that Jizz-bin

58:05.220 --> 58:06.779
Still gets your endorsement?

58:06.855 --> 58:10.019
What?
But I didn't ever... What?

58:10.092 --> 58:12.994
"Tanner Daniels endorsed
Fawcett brooks yesterday

58:13.062 --> 58:14.553
"At the G.S.A. Meeting.

58:14.630 --> 58:16.861
The new power B.F.F.s known as..."

58:16.932 --> 58:19.561
G-Fawce.
Cute, isn't it?

58:19.635 --> 58:21.570
You really think
another bland blonde like her

58:21.637 --> 58:23.162
Deserves the crown, Tanner?

58:23.238 --> 58:26.174
Well, at least she stands up
for my... My rights or whatever.

58:26.241 --> 58:27.921
What? Please.
This hack-tivist doesn't give

58:27.977 --> 58:29.673
A flying fairy about gay rights.

58:29.745 --> 58:31.941
She just did it to gain
the advantage with you.

58:32.014 --> 58:34.210
Oh, you mean like what you did
with that male-bait, Christian?

58:34.283 --> 58:36.616
Whatever! At least I tried
to bribe him with sex.

58:36.685 --> 58:38.347
I treated him
like an actual human being

58:38.621 --> 58:40.783
And not some asexual,
neutered little purse puppy.

58:40.856 --> 58:42.119
Come on, tan.
I've had enough

58:42.191 --> 58:43.989
Bad-dinner-theater dramatics
for one day.

58:44.059 --> 58:46.028
We've got a revolution to plan.

58:46.095 --> 58:48.121
Do not come for my craft, bitch!

58:48.197 --> 58:50.063
Do not come for my bitch, bitch!

58:50.132 --> 58:53.000
Aah!

58:53.068 --> 58:55.128
Yeah, it sounds great.

58:55.204 --> 58:58.868
Right. Promise.
No drinks for me.

58:58.941 --> 59:01.877
See you then, dude.

59:03.646 --> 59:05.012
Hey.

59:05.080 --> 59:06.946
What's up?

59:07.016 --> 59:08.382
Not much.

59:08.651 --> 59:11.052
You're making
quite the stank over prom,

59:11.120 --> 59:14.056
Joining the G.S.A.,
Endorsing your new Bestie.

59:14.123 --> 59:18.652
I didn't endorse anyone.
I just... It's not fair.

59:18.727 --> 59:20.787
We should be treated
like everyone else.

59:20.863 --> 59:25.665
"We"? I mean,
you got to ask me first.

59:25.734 --> 59:27.794
What are you talking about?

59:27.870 --> 59:30.863
You and me. Prom.

59:30.939 --> 59:33.306
Uh...

59:33.375 --> 59:37.142
Caprice set up this thing
with her friend. I just...

59:37.212 --> 59:39.078
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who said anything

59:39.148 --> 59:40.428
About us going to prom together?

59:40.683 --> 59:42.879
Just that...
No, no, I was saying,

59:42.951 --> 59:46.410
Like, if you wanted
a friend to go with,

59:46.689 --> 59:50.057
But, like, obviously you got
that, you know, taken care of,

59:50.125 --> 59:53.425
So, you know, I hope
your prince charming

59:53.696 --> 59:56.723
Gives you everything you want...

59:56.799 --> 59:57.960
and also crabs.

01:00:10.145 --> 01:00:12.808
I got your Facebook message.

01:00:12.881 --> 01:00:15.817
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

01:00:17.786 --> 01:00:20.221
Does your vocal coach
know you smoke?

01:00:23.192 --> 01:00:25.320
Look, we all know you're gayer

01:00:25.394 --> 01:00:28.057
Than a very special episode
of "glee."

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.224
I am not!

01:00:30.299 --> 01:00:32.234
What's your point?

01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:35.931
Well, I need a minion,
and you need a diva to worship.

01:00:36.004 --> 01:00:39.236
With Tanner and Fawcett
heading up this fey prom,

01:00:39.308 --> 01:00:40.776
That leaves an opportunity

01:00:40.843 --> 01:00:42.436
For me to be the queen
of the real one.

01:00:42.511 --> 01:00:46.346
So, how would you like to be
my date, maybe even my king?

01:00:48.784 --> 01:00:50.184
All right, if you still
need convincing,

01:00:50.252 --> 01:00:53.154
Check out a pic
of Tanner's prom date.

01:00:53.222 --> 01:00:55.191
He can do better, but I'm in.

01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:00.954
Hi, there.
Caprice, you said

01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:03.157
You had something
you wanted to talk about?

01:01:03.232 --> 01:01:05.360
I do.

01:01:08.437 --> 01:01:10.133
Love your cloak.

01:01:10.205 --> 01:01:11.434
Thanks.

01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:16.938
Support traditional
prom-going values.

01:01:17.012 --> 01:01:21.006
Buy tickets to the official,
school-sanctioned prom.

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:24.884
Attend the prom by students,
for all students.

01:01:26.855 --> 01:01:28.323
Can I have one, please?

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:30.188
No.
Um, sorry.

01:01:30.259 --> 01:01:32.389
You're not on our list
of approved students.

01:01:32.415 --> 01:01:32.947
What?

01:01:32.995 --> 01:01:35.863
This being an Indie operation,
we've got very limited space,

01:01:35.931 --> 01:01:38.196
But I'm sure Caprice's
old-fashioned loser dance

01:01:38.267 --> 01:01:40.896
Has plenty of tickets
available. Thank you.

01:01:42.104 --> 01:01:44.005
Fawcett, what the hell was that?!

01:01:44.072 --> 01:01:47.509
Tan, if we want to pull off this
whole gay-inclusive-prom thing,

01:01:47.576 --> 01:01:51.035
We're gonna have to
keep it kind of... exclusive.

01:01:51.113 --> 01:01:53.014
Look, I didn't make up these rules,

01:01:53.081 --> 01:01:54.913
But a fugly prom is a failed prom.

01:01:56.585 --> 01:01:58.520
So wrong.

01:01:58.587 --> 01:02:01.284
You smell great.

01:02:02.591 --> 01:02:04.423
Thank you.

01:02:04.493 --> 01:02:06.086
I told you.
This is crazy.

01:02:06.161 --> 01:02:08.562
It's like freaking
high-school "game of thrones"

01:02:08.831 --> 01:02:10.891
Out here or something.

01:02:10.966 --> 01:02:13.492
Sorry, Ellen Jr.,
But you can't take

01:02:13.569 --> 01:02:15.265
Your poor man's Portia
to this dance.

01:02:15.337 --> 01:02:17.169
Try the pro-sodomy prom.

01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:19.572
You do know that oral
counts as sodomy, right?

01:02:19.842 --> 01:02:23.006
So, with the amount of going
down that goes down at prom,

01:02:23.078 --> 01:02:26.207
You might want to rethink
the concept. Right, Brent?

01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:29.217
By the way, did they change
the official prom song

01:02:29.284 --> 01:02:31.583
To "trapped in the closet"
just for you?

01:02:31.854 --> 01:02:34.016
Nice try, lies-bian,
but I know for a fact

01:02:34.089 --> 01:02:36.422
That my boo Brent
is as straight as they come.

01:02:36.491 --> 01:02:40.053
Like Kanye or Diddy or Tyler Perry.

01:02:40.128 --> 01:02:42.222
Whatev.

01:02:42.297 --> 01:02:44.926
Er. Whatever.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.368
The full word.
I said it all.

01:02:49.872 --> 01:02:52.967
'tophie, I want to go to cool prom.

01:02:53.041 --> 01:02:55.476
Hey, 'Shley,
you know Caprice calls you

01:02:55.544 --> 01:02:57.570
A Ginger-snatch
behind your back, right?

01:02:57.646 --> 01:02:59.080
She does?

01:02:59.147 --> 01:03:01.173
Well, Fawcett said your religion

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:04.049
Is just scientology without
birth control or famous people.

01:03:04.119 --> 01:03:07.089
Well, you know what?

01:03:07.155 --> 01:03:09.317
"F" you both.

01:03:09.391 --> 01:03:11.189
She'll be fine.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:15.493
And we'll take two tickets to
the 100% totally un-gay prom.

01:03:15.564 --> 01:03:17.192
Thank you.

01:03:18.634 --> 01:03:20.933
Mm. Cute shorts.

01:03:21.003 --> 01:03:22.904
And you.

01:03:22.971 --> 01:03:25.634
I hear you and spigot here
are denying

01:03:25.908 --> 01:03:28.002
Certain less-than-favorable
people tickets.

01:03:28.076 --> 01:03:29.544
Relax, "so-fat."

01:03:29.611 --> 01:03:31.978
You and "memoirs of a gay nerd"
are allowed to come.

01:03:32.047 --> 01:03:35.313
I'm giving you a temporary pass
to the cool kids' table.

01:03:35.384 --> 01:03:37.649
We wouldn't come
if you paid us, Fawcett.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.185
Or should I say "fascist"?

01:03:40.255 --> 01:03:42.247
It's your social funeral, sweetie.

01:03:42.324 --> 01:03:45.089
I'll start mourning now.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.360
So-fat! I mean, Sophie...
Damn it... Wait!

01:03:50.432 --> 01:03:52.594
You know what?

01:03:52.668 --> 01:03:56.298
You both have become so much more

01:03:56.371 --> 01:04:00.240
Than these bitches'
sexless accessories.

01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:03.609
You've become full-blown tools,

01:04:03.679 --> 01:04:06.114
In every sense of the word.

01:04:07.616 --> 01:04:09.141
Oh.

01:04:14.256 --> 01:04:17.283
Tanner. Tanner.

01:04:17.359 --> 01:04:20.454
Tanner! Tanner!

01:04:20.529 --> 01:04:23.465
Tanner!

01:04:23.532 --> 01:04:25.091
What is your deal?

01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:27.329
I can't do this anymore!
Excuse me?

01:04:27.402 --> 01:04:29.701
The last I checked,
this was all for you.

01:04:29.972 --> 01:04:31.531
Is it?

01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:34.440
You know I actually started to
believe that you were my friend?

01:04:34.509 --> 01:04:37.479
But what is this, really?
Am I just some tool to you,

01:04:37.546 --> 01:04:41.176
A wrench so that you can screw
over Caprice and 'Shley?

01:04:41.249 --> 01:04:44.378
Wrenches don't screw things.
God, you are gay.

01:04:44.453 --> 01:04:46.649
But you're right.

01:04:46.722 --> 01:04:50.181
Look, at first I just wanted
to keep you to myself.

01:04:50.258 --> 01:04:56.289
After Hamilton dumped me...
Yeah, it's true, he dumped me...

01:04:56.365 --> 01:04:59.028
I thought I needed you
by my side to win.

01:04:59.101 --> 01:05:01.161
But it's different now.

01:05:01.236 --> 01:05:03.569
I really like hanging
out with you...

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:05.436
for real.

01:05:05.507 --> 01:05:07.476
Then why create a separate prom?

01:05:07.542 --> 01:05:09.636
I mean, you're gonna win
queen no matter what.

01:05:09.711 --> 01:05:12.738
Don't be so sure.

01:05:13.015 --> 01:05:15.610
I took a peek at the polling data.

01:05:15.684 --> 01:05:17.243
I rule with the popular kids,

01:05:17.319 --> 01:05:19.311
But the other 90%,
the rest of the school,

01:05:19.388 --> 01:05:22.187
Just think I'm a soulless bitch.

01:05:22.257 --> 01:05:24.351
I mean, they'd rather
vote for 'Shley.

01:05:24.426 --> 01:05:26.588
At least she's nice.

01:05:26.661 --> 01:05:31.224
Caprice...
She's got talent.

01:05:31.299 --> 01:05:32.631
What have I got?

01:05:36.438 --> 01:05:39.340
You have me.

01:05:39.408 --> 01:05:41.104
Really?

01:05:43.145 --> 01:05:45.614
You're more than what people
see on the surface, Fawcett,

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.615
And you're the only one
who stood up for me

01:05:47.682 --> 01:05:51.642
When it really mattered,
so let's make a compromise.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:54.053
You let everyone come
to the alterna-prom,

01:05:54.122 --> 01:05:56.182
And I'll make sure that
you get that crown.

01:05:56.258 --> 01:05:57.453
Deal?

01:05:57.526 --> 01:06:00.325
Yeah.

01:06:04.099 --> 01:06:08.799
Thanks, all of you, for helping
to keep our prom gayness-free.

01:06:09.071 --> 01:06:14.567
So, I'm thinking, activity-wise,
how about a promise-ring booth?

01:06:14.643 --> 01:06:16.202
So charming.
Love it.

01:06:16.278 --> 01:06:19.112
Promise rings for prom.
Cute.

01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:21.309
I've got a little bit of a
different plan, all right?

01:06:21.383 --> 01:06:24.217
Listen up, ladies.
Tanner and Fawcett are poaching

01:06:24.286 --> 01:06:26.255
All the cool kids for
their little pansy prom.

01:06:26.321 --> 01:06:28.415
If we don't act quick, we
won't have enough people

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:30.083
For a halfway-decent hokey pokey.

01:06:30.158 --> 01:06:35.461
What we need to do is
start "Prom-oting" prom.

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.055
You feel me?

01:06:37.132 --> 01:06:40.796
Amazing.
Whoo! Yeah!

01:06:42.504 --> 01:06:46.669
Hmm. Don't you think this might
be a bit over-the-top, Brent?

01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:51.736
I'm just fighting
flamers with flame.

01:06:51.813 --> 01:06:55.272
<i>♪ A la, a la la,
would you be kind? ♪</i>

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:58.548
<i>♪ Gimme one little more,
and I'll be superfine ♪</i>

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.384
<i>♪ A la la, a la la ♪</i>

01:07:00.455 --> 01:07:02.447
Hey.
Oh, my god!

01:07:02.524 --> 01:07:04.152
Relax, dude.

01:07:04.226 --> 01:07:07.560
I just wanted to tell you how
much I admire your passion.

01:07:07.629 --> 01:07:11.293
You're really... organized.

01:07:11.366 --> 01:07:13.207
I mean, when I heard about
Tanner going to prom

01:07:13.268 --> 01:07:16.432
With that other dude, I was
totally grossed out, too.

01:07:16.505 --> 01:07:20.340
Right, bro? I mean, like,
two dudes, like...

01:07:20.408 --> 01:07:23.401
Ugh! Ugh. Ick.
Blah. Yeah.

01:07:23.478 --> 01:07:28.849
So, um, do you want to
feel how straight I am?

01:07:30.519 --> 01:07:32.283
Come again.

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:37.555
Whoa. Is this actually
happening, or is this a dream?

01:07:37.626 --> 01:07:39.595
Because I just changed
my sheets yesterday.

01:07:39.661 --> 01:07:41.357
No, it's real, bro.
Oh, my god.

01:07:41.429 --> 01:07:42.727
Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:07:42.797 --> 01:07:45.824
How did you know?
I mean, did Tanner tell you?

01:07:45.901 --> 01:07:47.597
No, dude, I figured it out myself.

01:07:47.669 --> 01:07:49.865
Tanner won't even look at me
since I tried to get with him.

01:07:49.938 --> 01:07:52.305
Mmm. Mmm.
Wait. What am I doing?

01:07:52.374 --> 01:07:53.672
No, no way, no.

01:07:53.742 --> 01:07:56.234
I cannot have Tanner's
rejected sloppy seconds.

01:07:56.311 --> 01:07:57.745
I have too much self-respect.

01:07:57.812 --> 01:08:00.281
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some anti-gay

01:08:00.348 --> 01:08:02.340
Prom posters to finish.

01:08:02.417 --> 01:08:04.443
Mmm.

01:08:06.555 --> 01:08:10.458
So close. God damn it!

01:08:11.693 --> 01:08:14.162
I am so sorry.

01:08:14.229 --> 01:08:16.357
<i>♪ You got me shrunk like a... ♪</i>

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:19.629
"Prom is short for
promenade, not prom-n-aids."

01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:22.398
No one but Brent could
come up with a pun

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:24.904
That simultaneously
lame and offensive.

01:08:24.973 --> 01:08:28.171
I told you...
He has officially lost it.

01:08:28.243 --> 01:08:30.178
What the shit were you thinking?!

01:08:30.245 --> 01:08:31.837
This language is unacceptable!

01:08:31.912 --> 01:08:33.676
Principal Crowe, as
a devout Mormon,

01:08:33.747 --> 01:08:37.276
I think the signs are all
totally true and appropriate.

01:08:37.352 --> 01:08:40.880
Oh, in what universe would
"boutonnieres, not butt sex!"

01:08:40.956 --> 01:08:43.515
Be appropriate for a prom slogan?

01:08:43.591 --> 01:08:45.457
Yeah, and "no tossing salads"?

01:08:45.527 --> 01:08:47.792
I got the cafeteria
ladies coming in here

01:08:47.862 --> 01:08:49.796
Asking me if I changed the menu!

01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:52.299
I've got news
organizations calling me,

01:08:52.367 --> 01:08:54.359
Not to mention the ACLU.

01:08:54.435 --> 01:08:55.698
Facebook!

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:56.930
People are tweeting about this!

01:08:57.005 --> 01:08:59.372
We... We weren't thinking.

01:08:59.441 --> 01:09:00.932
Well, I'm particularly disappointed

01:09:01.009 --> 01:09:02.636
In you, Mr. Van Camp.

01:09:02.711 --> 01:09:04.542
I expected more of you.

01:09:04.613 --> 01:09:06.411
I was thinking about
suspending you all.

01:09:07.816 --> 01:09:10.216
But instead I'm just
gonna cancel prom.

01:09:10.285 --> 01:09:12.481
Oh, wait, no!
You can't do that!

01:09:12.554 --> 01:09:14.819
Wait a minute. That'll turn
us into social pariahs.

01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:17.323
Yeah, that's not fair. You're
not canceling their prom, too.

01:09:17.392 --> 01:09:19.417
That prom is out of principal
Crowe's jurisdiction,

01:09:19.493 --> 01:09:21.895
And its organizers haven't
been promoting a hate.

01:09:21.962 --> 01:09:24.694
Now get out of here before I change
my mind about the suspensions.

01:09:27.301 --> 01:09:28.736
That was terrific restraint.

01:09:28.803 --> 01:09:30.828
Thank you.

01:09:36.778 --> 01:09:40.010
Well, Tanner, looks like we've
now got the only game in town.

01:09:40.282 --> 01:09:42.877
Though, Brent, I have
to give you some props.

01:09:42.951 --> 01:09:45.819
Those signs were pretty Hilar.
Later, later.

01:09:45.886 --> 01:09:47.651
Sorry.

01:09:48.823 --> 01:09:50.416
Onward, Christian soldiers.

01:09:50.492 --> 01:09:51.892
They want to cancel our prom?

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.553
Then we will organize a protest

01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:55.927
Of their deviant
dance of debauchery.

01:09:55.997 --> 01:09:57.522
She's right, "b."

01:09:57.599 --> 01:10:00.034
The whole "me being prom
queen" ship has sailed.

01:10:00.302 --> 01:10:03.466
But take it from an actress...
If we can't be in the spotlight,

01:10:03.538 --> 01:10:06.007
We can sure make one
hell of a scene.

01:10:06.074 --> 01:10:10.846
Family values!

01:10:10.912 --> 01:10:13.643
Family values! Family...

01:10:13.715 --> 01:10:14.978
'tophie, how could you?

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.713
Those signs that you made
were just so, so mean.

01:10:17.786 --> 01:10:20.312
Babe, I was just trying to
protect our relationship.

01:10:20.388 --> 01:10:22.755
Oh, well, congratulations.
You just did the opposite.

01:10:22.824 --> 01:10:24.793
We are so done-zo.

01:10:27.829 --> 01:10:30.298
Hmm.

01:10:30.365 --> 01:10:31.731
How's it going, guys?

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.735
Oh, fantastic.

01:10:33.802 --> 01:10:35.737
We've devised a genius
way to take "tan lines"

01:10:35.804 --> 01:10:37.295
Down a few notches.

01:10:37.372 --> 01:10:39.068
And knock "fawce-slut"
off her horse high.

01:10:39.341 --> 01:10:40.866
Okay, so, while you
crazy Christians

01:10:40.942 --> 01:10:42.843
Are outside protesting,
Caprice and I will

01:10:42.911 --> 01:10:44.777
Infiltrate the prom
in killer ensembles.

01:10:44.846 --> 01:10:46.075
James bond. Hello.

01:10:46.348 --> 01:10:47.828
And the moment that
Tanner and Fawcett

01:10:47.882 --> 01:10:51.649
Are crowned king and queen,
we douse them with this.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.621
It'll be very Stephen
king's "Carrie"

01:10:53.688 --> 01:10:55.384
Meets Mariah Carey's "glitter."

01:10:55.457 --> 01:10:57.016
Tanner will hate it.

01:10:57.092 --> 01:10:59.084
This one time, in, like, the
fourth grade, I accidentally,

01:10:59.361 --> 01:11:00.852
Like spilled glitter on
him in arts and crafts.

01:11:00.929 --> 01:11:02.693
He didn't talk to me
for like a month.

01:11:02.764 --> 01:11:04.630
It's like the longest he and I
have ever gone without speaking,

01:11:04.699 --> 01:11:06.930
You know, up until now.

01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:08.492
And Fawcett will be picking it

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:10.869
Out of her prized
Goldilocks for months.

01:11:10.939 --> 01:11:13.465
With any luck, she'll have to
shave it back like Britney.

01:11:13.541 --> 01:11:15.601
Yeah!
I love it!

01:11:15.677 --> 01:11:17.373
Great scheming, guys.

01:11:17.445 --> 01:11:19.914
I'm just so glad we're
friends now, Caprice.

01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:22.007
I've always wanted
an S.B.F.

01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:23.551
An S.B.F.?

01:11:23.618 --> 01:11:25.553
- Sassy black friend.
- Duh.

01:11:28.656 --> 01:11:31.558
As Brent and Caprice plotted,

01:11:31.626 --> 01:11:32.958
I realized I had my own

01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:35.724
Unfinished business
to take care of.

01:11:35.797 --> 01:11:36.958
Hey.

01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:39.523
I-I mean, hey.

01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:42.070
I've got something to say.

01:11:42.137 --> 01:11:45.596
Tanner, honey, what is it?
You need a snack.

01:11:45.673 --> 01:11:47.665
No, Shannon, I'm not hungry.

01:11:47.742 --> 01:11:49.370
I, um...

01:11:49.444 --> 01:11:51.106
I've got something
to tell you both,

01:11:51.179 --> 01:11:53.375
And I don't care if
you like it or not.

01:11:54.816 --> 01:11:56.148
Tanner?

01:11:56.418 --> 01:11:58.080
Honey, what is it?

01:12:00.088 --> 01:12:01.750
I, um...

01:12:01.823 --> 01:12:03.951
so, I'm... I'm not
actually going to the prom

01:12:04.025 --> 01:12:05.653
With Fawcett tomorrow.

01:12:05.727 --> 01:12:09.823
I mean, she's driving me,
but I've got another date...

01:12:09.898 --> 01:12:11.161
A boy.

01:12:11.433 --> 01:12:13.163
I like boys.

01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:17.070
Well, I mean, not boys,
like... Gross.

01:12:17.138 --> 01:12:19.937
Men. Men.
Like men my own age.

01:12:20.008 --> 01:12:23.638
And so did Abraham Lincoln.
I read that somewhere.

01:12:23.711 --> 01:12:26.613
And he was, like,
the best republican ever,

01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:29.082
So you should probably
say something

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:31.745
Before I keep saying more things.

01:12:34.722 --> 01:12:36.418
Tanner...

01:12:36.491 --> 01:12:37.982
we know.

01:12:40.528 --> 01:12:42.019
Y-You what?

01:12:42.096 --> 01:12:44.088
We know.

01:12:44.165 --> 01:12:45.963
And it's okay.

01:12:46.034 --> 01:12:49.630
Although your claims
about Abraham Lincoln

01:12:49.704 --> 01:12:51.935
I don't think are
entirely substantiated.

01:12:52.006 --> 01:12:53.440
Tanner, sweetie.

01:12:53.508 --> 01:12:55.909
I mean, you haven't been
completely consistent

01:12:55.977 --> 01:12:57.741
In clearing the internet history.

01:12:57.812 --> 01:13:00.680
We've seen some stuff.

01:13:00.748 --> 01:13:02.717
Word.
We have seen some stuff.

01:13:02.784 --> 01:13:04.685
I mean, who knew that that even...
Oh, my god.

01:13:04.752 --> 01:13:07.517
Anyway, so, you're 100%

01:13:07.589 --> 01:13:10.115
Completely allergic
to the lady parts.

01:13:10.191 --> 01:13:13.184
That's fine!
Who cares? It's okay.

01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:15.856
I- I-I could be Bi.

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:17.865
Yeah, right!

01:13:17.932 --> 01:13:19.833
Of course you can.

01:13:19.901 --> 01:13:23.838
Okay, well, um...

01:13:23.905 --> 01:13:26.170
so, good, I guess, then.

01:13:26.241 --> 01:13:29.507
I'm... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go.

01:13:29.577 --> 01:13:31.011
Tanner, honey, do you need a snack?

01:13:31.079 --> 01:13:33.048
You're skinny.

01:13:33.114 --> 01:13:35.140
He could be bi.

01:13:35.216 --> 01:13:36.684
Coastal.

01:13:38.953 --> 01:13:40.888
Oh, prom! Let's do this!

01:13:42.857 --> 01:13:44.519
Oh, that's cute.

01:13:44.592 --> 01:13:48.029
Oh, that's so prom.
Yes.

Hey, girl.

01:14:04.078 --> 01:14:06.638
I was talking to my son.

01:14:06.714 --> 01:14:08.774

Darling, can I just...
Just want...

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.323
Listen, I just wanted to say
that I don't know what,

01:14:55.597 --> 01:14:57.623
You know, all this
is and I don't...

01:14:57.699 --> 01:15:00.328
Whatever... Whatever
you want to call yourself.

01:15:00.602 --> 01:15:07.602
I mean, the bottom line is
your mom loves you very much,

01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:10.640
Like crazy a lot, like to the point

01:15:10.712 --> 01:15:13.147
Where it's really
kind of ridiculous.

01:15:13.214 --> 01:15:15.706
It's almost embarrassing.
A lot.

01:15:15.783 --> 01:15:19.220
So, please just know that, darling.

01:15:19.287 --> 01:15:22.655
Thanks.
I love you, too.

01:15:22.724 --> 01:15:24.283
Oh, gosh, honey.
Thank you so much.

01:15:24.359 --> 01:15:27.193
Here, I don't want to... I don't
want to smudge your makeup.

01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:29.321
Shall surely be put to death!

01:15:30.832 --> 01:15:34.769
Prepare ye...
for the infidels.

01:15:36.137 --> 01:15:37.867
Finally.
Where have you been?

01:15:37.939 --> 01:15:40.773
And why are you wearing that?

01:15:40.842 --> 01:15:44.142
You're bailing on me to go
after that latter-day skank.

01:15:44.212 --> 01:15:45.703
'Shley dumped 'topher

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.045
And needs a G.B.F.
To escort her to prom.

01:15:48.116 --> 01:15:50.381
She still seems to
think that I'm gay,

01:15:50.652 --> 01:15:53.053
Despite our little
dry-humping session.

01:15:53.121 --> 01:15:56.091
The indignities and humiliations
a guy will go through

01:15:56.157 --> 01:15:58.058
Just for some Mormon ginge-muff.

01:15:58.126 --> 01:16:01.790
You really are a
flaming heterosexual.

01:16:01.863 --> 01:16:03.195
Guilty.

01:16:03.264 --> 01:16:05.256
Seriously, Sophe, can
you do me a huge favor

01:16:05.333 --> 01:16:06.858
And cover prom for the gazette?

01:16:06.934 --> 01:16:09.028
No.
Come on! Please.

01:16:09.103 --> 01:16:10.401
You, of all people, know

01:16:10.672 --> 01:16:12.402
That this insanity needs
to be documented.

01:16:12.674 --> 01:16:16.839
And, uh, well, I might
have my hands full.

01:16:16.911 --> 01:16:18.311
I am not paying aqua-valve one cent

01:16:18.379 --> 01:16:20.109
To get into her sham of a dance.

01:16:20.181 --> 01:16:22.878
Comped press passes.

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:26.682
Fine, but I'm only going
if there are appetizers.

01:16:26.754 --> 01:16:28.416
Yes!

01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:30.784
Don't hug me.
Come on.

01:16:35.763 --> 01:16:37.425
Aww!

01:16:37.699 --> 01:16:38.894
You're doing it again.

01:16:38.966 --> 01:16:40.400
What?

01:16:40.468 --> 01:16:42.960
That noise girls make when they
see two gay guys together.

01:16:43.037 --> 01:16:45.404
Yeah, it's the same
annoying sound people make

01:16:45.473 --> 01:16:48.102
When they see cute animals
dressed in human clothes.

01:16:48.176 --> 01:16:51.237
Ew, gross. Barf.
Is that better?

01:16:51.312 --> 01:16:54.282
Much.

01:16:54.348 --> 01:16:55.714
You're all gonna burn!

01:16:55.783 --> 01:16:57.718
Think of your soul you're defiling!

01:16:57.785 --> 01:16:59.151
Ever read the bible?!

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.246
"Do not lie with a man as
one lies with a woman!

01:17:01.322 --> 01:17:03.154
It is an abomination!"

01:17:03.224 --> 01:17:05.352
Abomination!

01:17:05.426 --> 01:17:07.156
You're all going to hell!

01:17:11.733 --> 01:17:13.429
That's right, bitches.

01:17:13.501 --> 01:17:15.367
I'm upstaging you all
with double the 'mo.

01:17:15.436 --> 01:17:18.201
And this one's imported.

01:17:44.932 --> 01:17:46.958
Take my picture!
Please, please take my picture!

01:18:20.301 --> 01:18:21.826
Caprice.

01:18:21.903 --> 01:18:23.337
Brent.

01:18:23.404 --> 01:18:25.373
Funny seeing you here.

01:18:25.439 --> 01:18:27.237
Welcome.

01:18:27.308 --> 01:18:29.072
We've seen the error of our ways.

01:18:29.143 --> 01:18:30.839
We just can't wait to
see you both crowned.

01:18:30.912 --> 01:18:33.973
You guys really deserve it.
Truly.

01:18:34.048 --> 01:18:36.017
See, you guys?
It all worked out.

01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:37.779
We all have our very own G.B.F.

01:18:37.852 --> 01:18:40.447
Actually, we're not all G.B.F.'s.

01:18:40.521 --> 01:18:42.922
Right... Brent's 100%,
grade-"A" hetero.

01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:45.425
Sure he is.

Well, hey, there, prom date.

01:19:00.241 --> 01:19:01.470
Hey.

01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:03.807
So, is this not the
lamest thing ever?

01:19:03.878 --> 01:19:05.403
I didn't know we were gonna be

01:19:05.479 --> 01:19:07.448
Your girlfriend's
matching corsages.

01:19:07.515 --> 01:19:10.542
I know, right?
Sorry about that.

01:19:10.618 --> 01:19:12.883
You want to get out of here?

01:19:12.954 --> 01:19:16.447
I know a place where we could...
get to know each other.

01:19:16.524 --> 01:19:19.858
Yeah, that sounds awesome.
I just feel like I should

01:19:19.927 --> 01:19:22.021
Really stay here for Fawcett's
sake, you know, 'cause...

01:19:22.096 --> 01:19:23.291
Tanner.
...she's like...

01:19:23.364 --> 01:19:24.889
Tanner.
...really fragile...

01:19:24.966 --> 01:19:26.992
Tanner.
...and... Hmm?

01:19:27.068 --> 01:19:31.062
I get it.
You're not there yet.

01:19:31.138 --> 01:19:34.870
So, if you don't mind,
I'm... I'm gonna bounce.

01:19:36.177 --> 01:19:37.338
Okay.

01:19:40.014 --> 01:19:41.846
Night.

01:19:41.916 --> 01:19:43.544
Sure.

01:19:53.527 --> 01:19:55.359
These ways, for this
is how the nations

01:19:55.429 --> 01:19:57.421
I am driving out before
you became defiled.

01:19:57.498 --> 01:19:58.051
Nice!

01:19:58.077 --> 01:20:00.288
As the land was defiled,
I came to punish it,

01:20:00.334 --> 01:20:02.132
And it has vomited
out its inhabitants.

01:20:02.203 --> 01:20:04.263
You shall keep my promises...
See ya.

01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:11.072
What are you doing?

01:20:11.145 --> 01:20:14.411
I feel a monster
stress zit coming on.

01:20:14.482 --> 01:20:16.041
You know when you
can feel it coming

01:20:16.117 --> 01:20:17.608
And there's nothing you
can do to stop it?

01:20:17.685 --> 01:20:19.017
Let me look.

01:20:20.221 --> 01:20:22.315
Okay, well, I do see it.

01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:25.189
The good news is it won't
surface for a few hours.

01:20:25.259 --> 01:20:26.591
Thanks.

01:20:26.661 --> 01:20:29.153
But if things run late
with posh spice,

01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:31.893
He might have to learn
to love you, zits and all.

01:20:31.966 --> 01:20:35.903
Not gonna happen.
He bailed.

01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:38.496
I guess I spent all this
time being a G.B.F.

01:20:38.572 --> 01:20:42.270
And never actually learned
how to be a real, live gay.

01:20:42.343 --> 01:20:47.145
Well, it sounds to me like
he doesn't deserve you.

01:20:48.983 --> 01:20:53.444
I just miss you guys so much.

01:20:53.521 --> 01:20:55.581
I can't believe I ditched you.

01:20:55.656 --> 01:20:58.057
I don't know what happened to me.

01:20:58.125 --> 01:21:01.493
I just...
Just got s-scared.

01:21:01.562 --> 01:21:03.394
Not to mention blinded by the flash

01:21:03.464 --> 01:21:05.456
Of bleached teeth and hair?

01:21:05.533 --> 01:21:08.435
Tanner?

01:21:08.502 --> 01:21:11.438
Our crowning moment
is only minutes away.

01:21:16.544 --> 01:21:18.708
Great tunes, great tunes.

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:21.279
Okay, hello there,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:21.349 --> 01:21:23.443
And, uh, everything in between.

01:21:23.517 --> 01:21:26.009
This is it, babes.
This is our moment.

01:21:26.087 --> 01:21:28.386
T-Fawce is gonna dominate.

01:21:31.392 --> 01:21:36.421
This is it, our moment.
T-Fawce is gonna eat it.

01:21:36.497 --> 01:21:38.557
We make a good team, "b."

01:21:38.632 --> 01:21:41.534
It is my pleasure to
announce this year's,

01:21:41.602 --> 01:21:44.572
Uh, prom king and queen
of north gateway's first

01:21:44.638 --> 01:21:48.632
"L-G-B-T-Q-A

01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:51.679
And every other letter you can
think of"- Inclusive prom.

01:21:51.746 --> 01:21:55.342
So, without further ado...

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:02.256
our trailblazing couple is...

01:22:03.491 --> 01:22:04.720
T-Fawce!

01:22:07.061 --> 01:22:08.757
Tanner and Fawcett!

01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:11.397
Wow.

01:22:16.604 --> 01:22:19.574
Congratulations.
Well deserved.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:22.007
Let me know when you think
they're in position.

01:22:22.076 --> 01:22:23.203
Congratulations.

01:22:23.277 --> 01:22:24.370
We love you, Tanner.

01:22:24.445 --> 01:22:25.606
Thank you.

01:22:25.679 --> 01:22:28.012
Oh, my goodness.
This is such a surprise.

01:22:28.082 --> 01:22:29.710
Fawcett, I want to say something.

01:22:29.784 --> 01:22:31.685
Okay.

01:22:31.752 --> 01:22:33.721
You're fierce!

01:22:33.788 --> 01:22:36.519
This is for you.

01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:38.582
Wait. Give him a second.

01:22:38.659 --> 01:22:41.219
We love you, T-Fawce!

01:22:41.295 --> 01:22:42.729
Look, uh, thanks, everyone,

01:22:42.797 --> 01:22:47.326
For making me king
of this gay prom.

01:22:47.401 --> 01:22:50.394
Oh, my god, he's doing it.
He's going full Lohan.

01:22:50.471 --> 01:22:55.068
I don't want to be
king of the gay prom

01:22:55.142 --> 01:23:01.548
Or be a gay best friend
or get gay-married.

01:23:01.615 --> 01:23:04.278
I just want to go to prom,

01:23:04.351 --> 01:23:09.346
Be a friend, and get
married, maybe.

01:23:09.423 --> 01:23:14.225
You all see me more as
an object or a symbol.

01:23:14.295 --> 01:23:17.356
I guess I've been
guilty of that myself.

01:23:17.431 --> 01:23:21.664
I used my friends as
shields to hide behind.

01:23:24.205 --> 01:23:27.334
I had friends who cared about me,

01:23:27.408 --> 01:23:31.140
Whether I was gay or whatever.

01:23:33.848 --> 01:23:39.412
And I had a best friend who
I shared everything with.

01:23:39.487 --> 01:23:43.754
And all I want is...
I mean, I'd give anything

01:23:43.824 --> 01:23:47.591
To just be his loyal
sidekick again.

01:23:52.266 --> 01:23:53.791
Thank you very much.

01:23:58.139 --> 01:24:01.166
Well, that's just sweeter
than a pug in a sundress.

01:24:01.242 --> 01:24:02.335
Oh, no!

01:24:08.449 --> 01:24:10.350
Oh, my god.

01:24:20.928 --> 01:24:23.295
Mnh.

01:24:23.364 --> 01:24:26.459
Brent! Jesus.
Are you okay?

01:24:26.534 --> 01:24:27.866
Thought you could upstage me

01:24:27.935 --> 01:24:29.836
With a classic
"what I learned" speech?

01:24:29.904 --> 01:24:33.170
Amateur.

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.141
So, Brent burst out of the closet

01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:38.338
In an explosion of glitter,
just like he always wanted,

01:24:38.412 --> 01:24:39.903
And I got my best friend back.

01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:41.740
Caprice, mission accomplished?

01:24:41.815 --> 01:24:43.613
Uh, not yet.

01:24:43.684 --> 01:24:46.381
Okay, y'all made your point.

01:24:46.453 --> 01:24:49.617
I made mine.
Now we all have a choice.

01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:51.522
You can stay out here,
bored out of your minds

01:24:51.592 --> 01:24:53.552
And freezing your asses off
with this crazy bitch.

01:24:53.594 --> 01:24:56.428
Or you can come inside
and dance your asses off

01:24:56.497 --> 01:24:58.432
With this crazy bitch.

01:24:58.499 --> 01:25:00.019
I mean, do you really
want to go heaven

01:25:00.201 --> 01:25:02.121
If it's filled with nothing
but psychos like her?

01:25:05.439 --> 01:25:06.566
That's what I thought.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.370
Let's go.

01:25:08.442 --> 01:25:11.207
Suit yourselves!
Run toward damnation!

01:25:11.278 --> 01:25:13.338
I'll see you all in hell!

01:25:13.414 --> 01:25:16.213
I mean, I won't see you
'cause I won't be there,

01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:18.752
But there's probably, like,
a window or something

01:25:18.819 --> 01:25:21.721
Where people in heaven can
look down to people in hell!

01:25:21.789 --> 01:25:26.750
And I'll see you through
that hell window... thing!

01:25:26.827 --> 01:25:29.387
That sucks, man.

01:25:29.463 --> 01:25:32.627

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.328

01:25:54.288 --> 01:25:55.881
So, I went down in history

01:25:55.956 --> 01:25:58.448
As the first kid in our
school to come out,

01:25:58.525 --> 01:26:01.620
But I definitely wasn't the last
because, as it turns out,

01:26:01.695 --> 01:26:04.927
The closet and high school
are kind of the same thing.

01:26:04.999 --> 01:26:07.366
They're both something
you can't wait to escape

01:26:07.434 --> 01:26:09.767
But are scared to death
of what lies beyond.

01:26:09.837 --> 01:26:11.999
They both make you kind of insane,

01:26:12.273 --> 01:26:14.606
Cause you to take on
a secret identity,

01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:17.474
Or make you confused...

01:26:17.544 --> 01:26:21.447
or mean...

01:26:21.515 --> 01:26:22.983
or crazy horny, even.

01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:24.985
Sweet Joseph smith, you are sexy.

01:26:25.052 --> 01:26:27.817
You too.

01:26:27.888 --> 01:26:29.720
You're out, right?

01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:31.759
For a face like yours,
I'll out myself

01:26:31.825 --> 01:26:34.920
To the entire Mormon
tabernacle choi...

01:26:34.995 --> 01:26:37.362
When you're in, every little thing

01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:38.956
Just seems like the hugest deal,

01:26:39.033 --> 01:26:40.501
But once you're out, well,

01:26:40.567 --> 01:26:42.729
You wonder why you
ever made such a fuss.

01:26:42.803 --> 01:26:45.967
And while things still suck
every once in a while,

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.602
When you finally leave both
the closet and high school,

01:26:49.677 --> 01:26:51.873
Everything just kind of...

01:26:51.945 --> 01:26:53.880
sucks less.

01:26:53.947 --> 01:26:55.779
So, now that you're out...

01:26:55.849 --> 01:26:57.374
I am?

01:26:57.451 --> 01:27:00.387
What about us?

01:27:00.454 --> 01:27:01.854
Us?

01:27:01.922 --> 01:27:03.618
Mm-hmm.

01:27:03.691 --> 01:27:06.024
Well, I just...
I was... Huh?

01:27:06.093 --> 01:27:09.063
What? No, you go first.

01:27:09.330 --> 01:27:10.764
I was thinking...

01:27:10.831 --> 01:27:12.026
mm-hmm.

01:27:12.099 --> 01:27:14.295
You know, if we ended
up together...

01:27:14.368 --> 01:27:15.563
Which we totally would

01:27:15.636 --> 01:27:18.071
If this were a classic
high-school movie.

01:27:18.339 --> 01:27:19.602
Right, and, you know,

01:27:19.673 --> 01:27:21.505
But we don't get to kiss
as the credits roll.

01:27:21.575 --> 01:27:23.544
Well, we got to,
you know, keep going.

01:27:23.610 --> 01:27:26.774
Maybe we'd last a few months...

01:27:26.847 --> 01:27:28.076
Right.
...A year.

01:27:28.349 --> 01:27:30.375
And then what?
Then we go to college

01:27:30.451 --> 01:27:32.647
And then I cheat on
you and it's awkward

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.586
And I lose you forever.

01:27:34.655 --> 01:27:37.420
So, what you're saying is,

01:27:37.491 --> 01:27:41.952
Instead of satisfying our
teenage horniness...

01:27:42.029 --> 01:27:47.798
instead of risking
having you as my B.F.,

01:27:47.868 --> 01:27:51.737
I'd rather keep you
forever as my B.F.F.

01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.736
Go "f" yourself.

01:27:57.845 --> 01:28:00.974
<i>♪ But now I've come back again ♪</i>

01:28:01.048 --> 01:28:04.917
So, after Brent had made
his gayness official,

01:28:04.985 --> 01:28:06.544
'Shley and Glenn won cutest couple

01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:09.351
When he came out as
irrefutably straight

01:28:09.423 --> 01:28:11.688
And she came out as
a total rice queen.

01:28:11.759 --> 01:28:14.490
But it took us a bit longer to
convince Fawcett to come out

01:28:14.561 --> 01:28:18.020
As a chemistry nerd with
a secret nice streak.

01:28:18.098 --> 01:28:19.589
Oh, my god!

01:28:19.666 --> 01:28:21.897
Sophie won a scholarship
to Sarah Lawrence

01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:23.961
After she published a
well-regarded analysis

01:28:24.037 --> 01:28:25.437
Of the adolescent propensity

01:28:25.506 --> 01:28:27.600
For self-perpetuated
objectification.

01:28:27.674 --> 01:28:31.441
And Brent and Caprice
were voted most dramatic,

01:28:31.512 --> 01:28:33.606
Which... Let's face it...
Is basically short-hand

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.411
For "gayest"and "bitchiest."

01:28:36.483 --> 01:28:40.443
As for me, I didn't win
any senior superlatives.

01:28:40.521 --> 01:28:42.422
With all the new outings going on,

01:28:42.489 --> 01:28:44.458
My sex life...
Or lack thereof...

01:28:44.525 --> 01:28:47.552
Was once again the least
interesting thing about me.

01:28:47.628 --> 01:28:51.121
I wasn't an accessory
or a sidekick.

01:28:51.198 --> 01:28:52.894
I was just me.

01:28:52.966 --> 01:28:54.935
And I couldn't have
been gayer about it.

01:28:55.002 --> 01:28:57.164
And I mean that in the
old-timey, happy way,

01:28:57.438 --> 01:28:58.963
Not the gay way, but...

01:28:59.039 --> 01:29:01.668

Who the hell wants that?

01:31:02.763 --> 01:31:04.527
