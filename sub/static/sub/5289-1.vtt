- You all right? Huh?
- Oh. Terrific.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.246
- I'm serious, now. You all right?
- I invented that stunt.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.873

- TONY: Okay, let's have the first team!

05:17.192 --> 05:20.887

- HOOPER: Two nipples for a dime.

- Sonny, that was terrific.
- No, that's terrific.

- Teach me to do that gag sometime.
- CULLY: Ha, ha.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.021
He wants to learn how to do that.
What, are you crazy?

05:30.121 --> 05:31.857

- Yes.
- That good, huh?

05:59.526 --> 06:02.262
- ROGER: Yeah.
- Would you go so far as to say perfect?

06:02.362 --> 06:05.515
Well, that's what he's supposed
to be, isn't he? Ha-ha-ha.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.975
Tony!

06:07.075 --> 06:09.436
I hate it when directors
slobber all over me.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.940
When your last picture made over $100 million,
you don't have to slobber over anybody.

- Yeah, here.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.194
If you're hurting that bad,
want me to go get the kit?

- Never felt better and had less.

- Listen, you can be replaced.
- Ha, ha.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.333
- The bike gag was terrific.
- HOOPER: Would've killed your ordinary man.

- Mm. Cully, you taking care of my boy?
- Well, I'm trying to, Mr. Berns.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.175
Well, make sure you don't give him
any more of those goddamn pills.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.341
Uh...

MAX: By the way, Sonny,
there's a new kid in town.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.015
Everyone says he's a young Sonny Hooper.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.392
- Would you like to check him out?
- I'm full up.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.020

- Thanks.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.824
has gotta try
and make a name for himself?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.993
- Do Gregory Peck for the doctor.
- (IN NORMAL VOICE) I don't want to see him.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.704
- Gotta go to get some x-rays.
- I've seen my x-rays.

07:09.804 --> 07:13.248
- They look like a map of L.A.
- Maybe you've built another off-ramp.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.292
Wait a minute.

07:15.393 --> 07:19.088
The Percodan is starting to work.
I feel the pain is vanishing.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.843

I think she can turn. I think she can whirl.

- Perfect companion.
- Me or Dancer?

I wouldn't kick either one of you
out of the hay.

GWEN: Hey, you never feed me
a can of beer like that.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.561
- You don't shake it up and down like that.
- Oh, that's very true.

(GWEN LAUGHS)

08:17.372 --> 08:21.401
- How'd it go today? Okay? No problems?
- Okay. No.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.194
You fill all those little minds
at school with knowledge?

08:24.295 --> 08:26.031
- I did my very best.
- Ah.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.784
- Cully called. How's your back?
- Oh, yeah? He's got a big mouth.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.451
GWEN: Oh, come on, how's your back?

08:31.553 --> 08:34.371
HOOPER: A lot better than his butt's
gonna be after I kick it.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.791
What the hell's the matter with Cully,
calling you up all the time?

08:37.892 --> 08:40.294
- Sonny. Your eyes are dilated.
- What?

08:40.395 --> 08:43.298
- Oh, don't start.
- How many pain pills did you take?

08:43.398 --> 08:46.927
I had two, for crying out loud.
I don't take dope. I don't take cocaine.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.263
I don't smoke pot. I take pain pills.
I got pain, for chrissake.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.599
Look at my socks.
What are they doing...?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.601
- Those are your socks.
- I know they are.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.729
Why are they on the phone?
My pants are on the chandelier.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.647
- You threw them there last week.
- I was in a horny mood.

09:00.749 --> 09:03.693
GWEN: It's all over the place.
It's like a beer-can collection.

09:03.793 --> 09:07.530
- It's not a big deal. You don't work that hard.
- I thought of putting it away.

09:07.630 --> 09:11.409
Well, why don't you put it away?
Why don't you take the stuff, put it in...?

09:11.509 --> 09:13.076
Sit down, will you?

09:17.849 --> 09:21.127
Now, do you want to hear
my thinking on this?

09:21.227 --> 09:25.547
If I just let things pile up long enough,
we won't be able to find each other.

09:25.648 --> 09:29.260
And if you can't find me,
you can't have me.

- Yes.

Sonny...

09:35.492 --> 09:38.310
I'm not asking for miracles.

09:38.411 --> 09:42.481
If you could just get the beer cans,
say, 25 feet from...

09:42.582 --> 09:45.526
Ten feet from the trash can. Ten feet.

- Is your back okay, really?
- It's fine.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.723
- Did you want to walk on it?
- No, I want you to crawl under it.

10:14.531 --> 10:18.059
TONY: All right, we're ready down here.
Could we clear the area, please?

10:18.159 --> 10:20.977
- Don't stand in front of the cameras.
- ADAM: You're a brave doggy.

- Right here?
- Put your hand right through there.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.358

- MAN 1: Working on it.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.611

- I love danger.
- TONY: Okay, we're ready down here.

- MAN 5: A camera mark.
- MAN 6: B camera mark.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.455
Okay. Action!

10:41.516 --> 10:44.753
Cut, cut! Sensational, Adam!

10:44.853 --> 10:46.713
Rest for a minute.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.715
- Good job there, Adam.
- ADAM: Was I all right?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.301
TONY: Help Mr. West down the steps.

10:51.401 --> 10:55.721
All right, now, let's get set up
for this stunt. Let's move it. Move it!

10:55.822 --> 10:57.932
- Good morning.
- Hey, Sonny, how are you?

10:58.032 --> 11:00.643
- Morning, dwarf.
- Clever. You ready?

11:00.743 --> 11:04.230
- Where's "Mr. Movie"? Oh, good morning.
- Right here. Good morning.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.816
Now, as I was telling you
the other day, Hooper...

11:06.916 --> 11:09.985
in this scene you'll be escaping
across the roof with the dog.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.697
HOOPER: The dog? Why do I have a dog?

11:12.797 --> 11:17.160
Just do the stunts like I tell you.
Let me worry about the creativity, okay?

11:17.260 --> 11:19.996
Now, about halfway through,
the sling will break...

11:20.096 --> 11:22.749
and down you will come, dog and all.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.627
And I'll pick up Adam falling off
the awning. It's simple.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.213
If it's so simple,
why don't we have the actor do it?

11:28.313 --> 11:30.799
- I'd like that in one take, Hooper.
- I hope so.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.966
- Okay, people, let's go.
- BIDWELL: Just a minute.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.885
Sonny, do you remember me?

11:35.987 --> 11:38.389
- Bidwell from the Humane Society.
- HOOPER: Oh, hi.

11:38.489 --> 11:42.727
- No dog is gonna fall from that.
- No, sir. We have a dummy dog.

11:42.827 --> 11:47.315
The sequence is King riding
with Sonny here, and then we cut...

11:47.415 --> 11:50.108
and substitute the dummy dog
for the actual fall.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.403
I don't know.
I don't like the whole setup.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.947
I don't like it either.
I'm the one that's got to do the falling.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.991
But you made that decision for yourself.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.079
- The poor dog can't make that decision.
- Don't worry, sir.

12:01.179 --> 12:05.667
The company is very eager to comply
with all Humane Society regulations.

12:05.767 --> 12:09.462
- So we really must be going now.
- Good to see you again, George.

12:10.021 --> 12:13.215
As you can see,
the dummy dog wouldn't fool anybody.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.385
- It wouldn't fool me.
- The realie will take the fall with you.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.929
- Oh, for chrissake.
- ADAM: There's my man.

12:19.030 --> 12:22.016
- Make me look great, Sonny.
- I'll make you look great, Adam.

12:22.116 --> 12:26.146
You can't use a real dog, Tony,
for chrissake. He can't hit an airbag.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.231
Maybe you can teach him on the way down.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.441
- Do me a favor, will you?
- Yeah, what is it?

12:30.541 --> 12:33.528
- Bring me a stepladder about this high.
- Yeah, what for?

12:33.628 --> 12:36.321
I want you to climb up
on it and kiss my ass.

57:35.285 --> 57:38.272
- A rocket car could make it.
- Well, I don't like it.

57:38.372 --> 57:40.314
What if you don't make it?

57:40.415 --> 57:42.901
- Cliff?
- They could make it, couldn't they?

57:43.001 --> 57:45.319
Sure, they could make it!

57:45.921 --> 57:47.238
Cliff...

57:47.339 --> 57:49.992
what's the longest jump
a rocket car's ever made?

57:50.092 --> 57:52.578
CLIFF: Buddy Joe took one 187 feet once.

57:52.678 --> 57:56.206
- How far is this?
- CLIFF: Three hundred and twenty-five feet.

57:56.306 --> 57:58.792
Could you beef up the suspension?

57:58.892 --> 58:03.963
Build a cage strong enough to protect Ski
and I when we landed on the other side?

58:04.064 --> 58:07.258
I could build a car like that,
but I can't tell how it would land.

58:07.359 --> 58:11.429
- That's 325 feet, Sonny.
- I know how far it is, Cliff.

58:13.240 --> 58:17.269
- Hell. It'd be a new world record.
- Wouldn't do my reputation any harm.

58:17.369 --> 58:19.229
Sonny, think of the risk.

58:19.329 --> 58:23.149
Forget about the risk, Max.
Just bring your checkbook.

58:23.250 --> 58:24.902
- Hooper?
- HOOPER: Huh?

58:25.002 --> 58:27.240
What's your fee for a gag like that?

58:28.588 --> 58:30.246
A hundred thousand dollars.

58:31.425 --> 58:33.993
Fifty thousand dollars for Ski...

58:34.094 --> 58:35.954
$50,000 for me.

58:36.054 --> 58:38.668
It's the world's biggest stunt.

58:39.558 --> 58:42.342
It ought to have
the world's biggest paycheck.

58:44.062 --> 58:48.216
Look, will you boys wait over there for
a minute? I want to discuss this with Roger.

58:48.316 --> 58:50.052
Of course, of course.

58:50.152 --> 58:51.428
You can do it, Cliff.

58:51.528 --> 58:55.348
Build a strong enough cage
so when we land on the other side...

58:55.449 --> 58:57.100
Roger...

58:57.200 --> 58:59.937
you know how much
over the budget we are.

59:00.037 --> 59:03.231
I want it, Max.
It's right, and I want it.

59:03.331 --> 59:05.945
It's a stunt that's never been done.

59:06.835 --> 59:09.571
And what if they don't make it, Roger?

59:09.671 --> 59:13.240
- Are you gonna be responsible for it?
- I don't care. I want it.

59:13.341 --> 59:16.078
It's the ending I want.
It's the statement I want to make.

59:16.178 --> 59:19.292
Cut something else if you have to.
I want that stunt.

59:20.223 --> 59:22.040
All right, Roger.

59:23.643 --> 59:26.755
I'll talk to Sonny,
see if I can't get his price down.

59:26.855 --> 59:30.133
No offense, Max,
but I don't think you could.

59:30.233 --> 59:32.386
Hooper knows you too well.

59:32.486 --> 59:35.805
Tony will get him down. Won't you, Tony?

59:35.906 --> 59:37.848
It'll be a pleasure.

MAN: I drove this sucker the other day
and it hauls ass. What'd you do to it?

59:41.828 --> 59:45.691
I put a 428 police interceptor in it.
Balanced and blueprinted.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.902
- It's plenty hot.
- If it's that hot, I could use it Friday night.

59:49.002 --> 59:51.363
- Listen up, listen up. Lead heads!
- What?

59:51.463 --> 59:54.281
- Any of you guys seen Hooper?
- Down here, short legs.

59:54.382 --> 59:55.699
- Hooper.
- Yeah?

59:55.801 --> 59:59.587
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- HOOPER: Step in my office.

Look, that gag you guys came up
with this morning...

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:06.919
100,000 is way out of line.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.588
Mm-hm. Well, that's my price.
It's not negotiable.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.801
Heh. Everything is negotiable, Hooper.

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:17.431
I know you're making big noises
just to jack up your fee, but here it is.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.808
Twenty grand for the jump.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:25.188
Because when you get right down to it,
that's all this is: just another car jump.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.354

I'm just thinking over your offer.
I think better when I'm driving.

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:46.879
Hooper, don't get excited.
Maybe we can compromise.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:52.090
I never compromise.

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:55.805
Life is too short. So are you.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:04.276
- Maybe we got off on the wrong foot, Hooper.
- I don't think so.

- Oh, Jesus!
- It's just another car jump.

- No. No.

When the earthquake hits,
we collapse the building.

you'll force one of those cars
