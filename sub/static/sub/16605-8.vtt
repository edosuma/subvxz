♪♪

00:10.276 --> 00:12.444
Now, everybody,
just try to keep
an open mind

00:12.446 --> 00:14.046
about this, okay?

00:14.048 --> 00:16.849
Is there something you're
not telling us about
this job with Hondo?

00:16.851 --> 00:18.684
Come on. When have
I asked you to trust me

00:18.686 --> 00:20.119
and it hasn't
worked out?

00:20.121 --> 00:21.453
Like half the time.

00:23.890 --> 00:26.658
My friends, my friends!
(CHUCKLES)

00:26.660 --> 00:28.527
It is I, Hondo!

00:28.529 --> 00:30.529
(SIGHS)

00:30.531 --> 00:33.132
I can't tell you
how much your welcome

00:33.134 --> 00:35.634
warms this old
pirate's heart.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.136
You are too gracious.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.737
I agree.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.073
Especially since
the last time we saw you,

00:41.075 --> 00:44.243
you abandoned us
on that doomed
Imperial station!

00:44.245 --> 00:46.645
But it all worked out
in the end, right?

00:46.647 --> 00:50.482
Of course it did,
because Hondo
always delivers.

00:50.484 --> 00:55.020
Just wait until you
see what my new partner
and I have cooked up.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.656
Wait. What new partner?

00:57.658 --> 01:01.360
Now, remember, guys?
Okay? Open mind.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.530
AZMORIGAN:
Have you recruited these
two-bit smugglers yet?

01:04.532 --> 01:06.331
We need to get moving!

01:06.333 --> 01:07.666
Azmorigan?

01:07.668 --> 01:10.602
What makes you think we'd even
consider working with him?

01:10.604 --> 01:13.705
Yes, I... I know that
the two of you have had

01:13.707 --> 01:16.675
your past conflagrations,

01:16.677 --> 01:19.845
but when Hondo profits,
so do you.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.781
And believe me, with
what we have to offer,

01:22.783 --> 01:27.453
the profit for your rebellion
will be great indeed.

01:34.727 --> 01:36.295
I don't care what
you have to offer.

01:36.297 --> 01:39.098
I'm not allowing
that on my ship.

01:39.100 --> 01:43.035
Oh, I remember now.
The feisty one.

01:43.037 --> 01:44.703
She hit me with a tray.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.872
Hera, take it easy.
Easy?

01:46.874 --> 01:50.576
This sack of bantha fodder
tried to buy me from
that sleemo Calrissian

01:50.578 --> 01:51.710
and make me his servant.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.146
I paid a fair price.

01:54.148 --> 01:57.683
Technically,
I still own you.
(CHUCKLES)

01:59.219 --> 02:03.288
Now, now, don't be
blind to this amazing
business opportun...

02:03.290 --> 02:05.324
Oh, sorry, sorry.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.460
Actually, I'm interested
in what you have to offer.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.795
Oh, wise one.

02:09.797 --> 02:13.098
I knew that you would
see things my way.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.134
Ooh, sorry again.

02:15.136 --> 02:18.570
Well, I'm not moving my
ship until I know exactly
what you're "offering."

02:18.572 --> 02:19.738
Weapons.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.775
I am promising you all
the weapons you can carry,

02:23.777 --> 02:27.646
unguarded and simply
yours for the taking.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.981
Not good enough.

02:28.983 --> 02:32.351
Even if they are proton bombs?

02:32.353 --> 02:35.621
According to our
mutual friend Ezra here,

02:35.623 --> 02:39.191
you've been trying
to acquire them
for quite some time.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.659
(NERVOUS GIGGLE)
Show us.

02:46.766 --> 02:48.667
The planet Wynkahthu.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.603
As I happened to
pass it on my travels,

02:51.605 --> 02:55.474
I detected an Imperial
freighter adrift in
the upper atmosphere.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.844
Escape pods jettisoned,
completely abandoned.

03:00.313 --> 03:01.847
Huh. Must've flown
too close.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.449
It's stuck in one of
those atmospheric storms.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.318
It's slowly
being pulled in.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.188
And its cargo
will soon be lost.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.823
I have the manifest
right here.

03:11.825 --> 03:16.728
Its hold is loaded
with a large supply
of proton bombs.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.231
Hmm. So what's
in it for you two?

03:19.233 --> 03:22.734
Well, there is also
some cargo you would
not be interested in.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.537
Uh, you know, there is,
um, precious metals,

03:25.539 --> 03:27.973
rare artifacts,
riches untold.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.308
That sort of thing.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.710
All probably stolen,
huh, Hondo?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.246
From the worlds
the Empire took over.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.315
So, we'll split
the treasure?

03:36.317 --> 03:39.585
(LAUGHING)

03:39.587 --> 03:42.321
"Split the treasure."
Oh, that's a classic.

03:42.323 --> 03:46.725
No, no, no, no, no, no,
my big, purple friend.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.360
You get the bombs.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.195
And you get the treasure.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.898
So what do you need us for?
Why not use your own crew?

03:52.900 --> 03:56.501
Now trust me, that is
a long, boring story.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.937
No, no, no, my friends,

03:58.939 --> 04:00.839
you are the guys
for this job.

04:00.841 --> 04:04.243
If the Empire couldn't
salvage the ship,
what hope do we have?

04:04.245 --> 04:08.347
A-ha! Because we have
something in our favor

04:08.349 --> 04:10.782
that the Empire does not,

04:10.784 --> 04:13.752
for we are desperate!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.887
Ugh! For once,
he's right.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.757
The Empire would
abandon this ship
without a second thought.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.860
But we can't afford to
pass up an opportunity
like this.

04:21.862 --> 04:22.861
Well said.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.529
Then we have a deal?

04:24.531 --> 04:28.567
I think we have a deal.
We... We have a deal!

04:28.569 --> 04:31.303
There'll be no way
to dock with that ship
in the storm.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.639
We'll need another way
to off-load the cargo.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.908
AP, you know the specs
for this type of freighter?
Of course.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.746
I was serving on a class four
container transport
when Chopper found me.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.982
Just get to work with
Zeb on a plan for this
salvage operation.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.985
Whoa. Wait.
You're putting Zeb in charge?

04:46.987 --> 04:49.321
Sorry, pal.
I got this one.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.959
No. I found this job.
This should be my mission.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.661
I thought you trusted me.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.928
Oh, I do.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.664
Just not when Hondo's around.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.466
Every time we work with him,
we come out on top.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.970
And that's why we're doing
this, with Zeb in charge.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.339
(SCOFFS) Yeah,
to keep an eye on me.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.945
I know what you're doing,
but Ezra's got to learn
for himself

05:13.947 --> 05:15.847
Hondo's not the friend
he appears to be.

05:23.022 --> 05:24.756
Engage the stabilizers.

05:29.028 --> 05:31.029
I'll hold her as
steady as I can.

05:31.031 --> 05:35.934
Estimating chance of
mission success at 38.5%.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.704
38.5%?
This is your plan!

05:38.706 --> 05:42.841
I have factored that in.
Without me, your chances
are almost zero.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.010
All right, salvage team.
We're on the clock.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.046
That cargo ship is sitting
above the storm's vortex
for now,

05:48.048 --> 05:49.348
but it's sinking fast.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.516
<i>Once it's pulled under,</i>
<i>it'll be ripped apart.</i>

05:51.518 --> 05:53.118
<i>So make sure you're not on it.</i>

05:53.120 --> 05:55.220
Don't worry.
We'll be in and out.

05:55.222 --> 05:59.324
Ezra, you good to go?
Yes, sir, Captain Orrelios.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.526
You got a problem
with me in charge,

06:01.528 --> 06:03.362
talk to Hera
when we get back.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.897
AZMORIGAN: Stop!
Wait for me, huh?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.966
(WHIMPERING)

06:07.968 --> 06:10.369
Ugh. You have got
to be kidding.

06:10.371 --> 06:14.806
Azmorigan, this is
dangerous work,
my frail friend.

06:14.808 --> 06:18.243
Perhaps you, with your
lovely singing voice,
should stay here.

06:18.245 --> 06:21.346
(LAUGHING)
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

06:21.348 --> 06:24.316
Me stuck here
while you claim
the best treasure.

06:24.318 --> 06:26.752
Hey, hey, hey, forget it!

06:26.754 --> 06:31.823
This job is half mine,
and I've got the manifest.

06:31.825 --> 06:36.094
I go with you, or we
don't go at all. Hear?

06:36.096 --> 06:37.996
Yeah, yeah.
I'll keep an eye on him.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.766
You better.
Sabine, let's do this.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.769
All right, boys.
Good luck! I'll be here
waiting for the cargo.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.919
ZEB: All clear. Come on!

07:06.893 --> 07:09.461
We're going to need
to restore power
to the cargo hold.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.097
Chopper, get to the bridge
and see what you can do.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.965
(GROANING)

07:13.967 --> 07:16.101
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

07:16.103 --> 07:18.870
Are you sure splitting up
is a good idea?

07:18.872 --> 07:21.606
It's a good order.
Here's another one.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.942
This way. Come on.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

07:34.153 --> 07:35.487
(CLANGING)
AZMORIGAN: What was that?

07:35.489 --> 07:36.988
It's nothing.
Some loose cargo.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.057
AZMORIGAN: I saw
something move! There!

07:40.660 --> 07:42.060
Wait a second.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.062
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

07:44.064 --> 07:45.664
AZMORIGAN: Look out!
(GRUNTING)

07:45.666 --> 07:47.532
Aah! I am attacked!

07:48.401 --> 07:49.968
What is that?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.604
I got him. I got him.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.440
Wait a minute. Isn't
this one of the guys
from your crew?

07:55.442 --> 07:56.675
(SNORTS)

07:56.677 --> 07:59.010
(SIGHS) Hello, Melch.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.179
Well, like I said,
it's a long,
boring story.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.347
We should get moving.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.584
Hold it. I think we have
time to hear this.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.152
(SPEAKING UGNAUGHT)

08:07.154 --> 08:10.121
Azmorigan came to me
with a flight plan
he'd acquired,

08:10.123 --> 08:14.459
an Imperial freighter
with a fat cargo
and no escort.

08:14.461 --> 08:17.262
So, it sounded like
an easy score.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.865
You attacked
an Imperial ship?

08:19.867 --> 08:21.132
We do it all the time.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.534
Exact... Really?

08:22.536 --> 08:24.302
Anyway, you should
be giving us a medal.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.038
Oh, if you'd
only seen it.
It was glorious.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.709
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Just skip to the part
where it all went wrong.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.512
We disabled the ship
with ion mines,

08:33.514 --> 08:35.814
but it drifted into
this maelstrom.

08:35.816 --> 08:39.117
But of course, my brave
little Ugnaughts...

08:39.119 --> 08:43.154
Look at him.
He insisted on trying
to board it anyway,

08:43.156 --> 08:46.191
but tragically...
(SHOUTING IN UGNAUGHT)

08:46.193 --> 08:48.226
Left you to die?

08:48.228 --> 08:51.496
I would never abandon
any of my crew.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.132
You are like family!

08:54.134 --> 08:55.834
Short... (SNIFFS)

08:55.836 --> 08:57.369
Fragrant family.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.070
All right,

08:59.072 --> 09:01.806
instead of the 1%
you were promised,

09:01.808 --> 09:03.975
I will give you two.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.212
(EXCLAIMS)

09:07.214 --> 09:08.680
You're welcome.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.850
So you brought us in
only after you'd lost
your entire crew

09:11.852 --> 09:13.184
trying it yourself.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.854
You lied to us.
What a surprise.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.923
Well, he didn't
exactly lie.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.025
He just didn't tell us
the whole truth.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.393
Well said!

09:21.395 --> 09:23.228
And some of the truth
is better than none
of the truth,

09:23.230 --> 09:24.896
which is what you used to get.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.098
So, don't try and tell me
that I have not grown.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.167
Oh, I don't have
any time for this.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.236
Cargo hold, now!

09:31.238 --> 09:34.039
I can pull
your limbs off later.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.441
He's always kidding.
(LAUGHING)

09:36.443 --> 09:37.842
He's kidding, right?

Chopper, we need power
on the cargo deck.

is over there.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.500
All right.
Let's get started.

We don't have much time.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.270
Looks like Hondo
came through, huh?

I'll believe it
when we're all safely
back on the <i> Ghost.</i>

EZRA: Come on. We made it
aboard, found the loot.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.444
What's gonna go wrong now?

HONDO: Stop kissing
my treasure!

10:53.152 --> 10:55.520
HONDO: It's mine
because I saw it first!

10:55.522 --> 10:58.189
No! I saw this
ship first,

10:58.191 --> 11:00.325
so I get first claim
on anything in it!

11:00.327 --> 11:01.760
First claim?
First claim?
What is that?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.161
What kind of
a criminal are you?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.163
ZEB: Both of you shut up!

11:05.165 --> 11:08.433
I'm not arguing with
this washed-up chuba!

11:08.435 --> 11:11.169
I saw better stuff
in the back anyway.
(CHUCKLES)

11:11.171 --> 11:12.871
Don't hurry back!

(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

11:16.476 --> 11:19.010
Hold on.
It's about to get windy.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.358
Well, it's about time!

11:33.360 --> 11:36.461
Crosswinds are too strong
to use the magnetic hoist.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.363
Copy that. Powering the winch.

11:47.673 --> 11:48.907
Now!

11:50.576 --> 11:52.744
Cables secured.
Good shot!

12:04.190 --> 12:07.392
All right, Sabine,
first load of proton
bombs coming out.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.328
Better watch yourself,
'cause if they get knocked
about too much...

12:10.330 --> 12:11.563
SABINE: <i> I'll be careful.</i>

12:24.043 --> 12:25.543
I got it! One down.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.246
Ezra, hook me up another one.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.249
Ezra? Ezra!
What are you doing?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.283
I'm helping Hondo.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.286
Un-attach that treasure
and start sending bombs!

12:35.288 --> 12:38.223
Whoa. Now wait a minute.

12:38.225 --> 12:41.292
Our ship, my operation.
Bombs first.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.429
Hey, we're all supposed
to be a team.

12:45.631 --> 12:48.233
Wait. Speaking of our team,
where's Azmorigan?

12:48.235 --> 12:49.534
He's been gone a while.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.771
Not our problem.
Sabine, another one
coming out!

12:52.773 --> 12:54.405
Azmorigan,
where are you?

12:54.407 --> 12:57.442
Oh, he's fine.
Don't worry.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.245
All right.
Now I'm worried.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.380
Azmorigan, this is Zeb.
Come in.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.149
I got this.
I'll find him.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.452
No, you get on the winch.
Keep the cargo going out.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.320
And remember, bombs first.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.823
And you just remember
we're on the clock here,
Captain.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.492
The sooner we finish
with this, the sooner
we're out of here.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.062

13:52.465 --> 13:54.966
Hera, Chop's lost
the stabilizers.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.835
This ship's gonna
go down fast now.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.503
And it'll take you
down with it!

13:58.505 --> 14:00.471
Get everyone off that tug now!

<i>problem with that.</i>

14:02.509 --> 14:04.509
We lost Azmorigan.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.344

but they haven't come back.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.646

<i>We're running out</i>

14:08.648 --> 14:10.448
Hondo, come on.
I need your help.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.650
Kind of busy
right now, Ezra.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.452
But isn't Azmorigan
your friend?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.820
Az... Oh.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.055
My partner.

14:17.057 --> 14:20.158
That means occasional
business acquaintance.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.528
It also means more treasure
for you if he doesn't
make it back, right?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.697
Well, I never
thought of it that way,

14:25.699 --> 14:28.733
but, uh, you never
disappoint me, Ezra.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.035
Yeah, wish I could
say the same.

We're in jail, you idiot!

14:41.348 --> 14:44.649
What happened?
I remember some kind of droid.

<i>I'm patching in Hera.</i>

14:48.989 --> 14:50.421
Looks like we're in the brig.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.990
Azmorigan's here too.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.992
We got knocked out
by some kind of droid.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.827
I thought this ship
was abandoned.

<i>that in my planning.</i>

14:59.432 --> 15:01.399

The sentry droids
the Empire utilizes
on its cargo ships.

It must have reactivated
