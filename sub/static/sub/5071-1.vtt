00:43.280 --> 00:47.639
For the sin we have
committed by gluttony.

00:47.640 --> 00:51.162
And for the sin we have committed
by succumbing to despair.

00:51.440 --> 00:55.201
For the sin we have
committed by stubbornness.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.891
And for the sin we have committed
by rashly judging others.

01:02.560 --> 01:06.519
Sweetheart, do you see
that guy in the corner

01:06.520 --> 01:08.959
with the dark hair and
the blue yarmulke?

01:08.960 --> 01:14.079
Absolutely gorgeous. That's Ben
Feldman, M&A, J.P. Morgan.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.362
- He has no chin!
- Mother, be quiet.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.319
- Shh!
- He recently separated from his wife.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.199
Some shikseh from Idaho.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.959
She could do better. She could!

01:23.960 --> 01:25.959
- You could do better.
- Mother.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.919
Mother, would you stop
feeding her perfectionism?

01:27.920 --> 01:29.439
You did the same thing with Larry.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.159
- I didn't like him either.
- What's not to like? The man was a prince.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.919
- I didn't care for him.
- What do you mean?

01:33.920 --> 01:35.999
- He wasn't the one, okay?
- Oy, the one.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.599
He had no sex appeal.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.770
Mother, sha! He's right over there.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.799
Marriage is the
hardest thing we do.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.359
She is 28 years old.
She hasn't dated in a year.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.519
I'm afraid she'll
be alone forever...

01:48.520 --> 01:50.160
Mom, would you shut up?
I'm atoning!

02:02.640 --> 02:04.842
<i>Gray clouds are gonna clear up</i>

02:06.040 --> 02:08.559
<i>Put on a happy face</i>

02:08.560 --> 02:11.719
<i>Brush off the clouds and cheer up</i>

02:11.720 --> 02:14.599
<i>Put on a happy face</i>

02:14.600 --> 02:17.959
<i>Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy</i>

02:17.960 --> 02:20.719
<i>It's not your style</i>

02:20.720 --> 02:23.239
<i>You look so good
that you'll be glad</i>

02:23.240 --> 02:26.679
<i>You decided to smile</i>

02:26.680 --> 02:29.079
<i>Pick out a pleasant outlook</i>

02:29.080 --> 02:32.079
<i>Stick out that noble chin</i>

02:32.080 --> 02:35.639

02:35.640 --> 02:38.719
<i>Slap on a happy grin</i>

02:38.720 --> 02:41.079
<i>And spread sunshine</i>

02:41.080 --> 02:43.851

03:06.720 --> 03:08.919

03:08.920 --> 03:12.599

03:12.600 --> 03:16.168
<i>Just put on a happy face</i>

03:24.720 --> 03:27.359
<i>Gray clouds are gonna clear up</i>

03:27.360 --> 03:29.999
<i>With sunshine all over the place</i>

03:30.000 --> 03:32.279
<i>If you'll put on</i>

03:32.280 --> 03:37.122
<i>A happy face</i>

03:42.560 --> 03:45.199
<i>Gray clouds are gonna clear up</i>

03:45.200 --> 03:47.799
<i>With sunshine all over the place</i>

03:47.800 --> 03:50.199
<i>If you'll put on</i>

03:50.200 --> 03:55.611
<i>A happy face</i>

03:57.320 --> 03:59.359
Peter, I'm telling you,
trust me on this one.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.999
- It means "speechless, without words."
- I think "unimpressed."

04:02.000 --> 04:04.319
- No, "speechless, perplexed."
- Are you sure on this?

04:04.320 --> 04:06.439
- I'm sure. Everybody gets this wrong.
- I'm almost positive here.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.439
- Howard, define "nonplussed."
- "Speechless, perplexed."

04:09.440 --> 04:11.279
Thank you, Howard.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.239
- And Howard, that cellist with the thing?
- Two umlauts. Both "U"s.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.639
Right, right, right.
Oh, my God! Hi!

04:18.640 --> 04:20.678
- Hi. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.999
- Okay, you're glowing. Are you thrilled?
- Let's see.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.399
I can't drink, smoke or eat
sushi for nine months.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.839
- Honestly, I'm panicked.
- Oh, my God.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.199
Did you guys celebrate last night?

04:28.200 --> 04:30.359
- It's so exciting.
- Yeah. Oh, God. Matthew's so excited.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.639
- Meyers, I gotta talk to you.
- Hey, Stein. Chuck, did you get my E-mail?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.599
- Yeah. "Deep-seeded." Who knew?
- Right.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.799
It has nothing to do with seeds.
Refers to how deeply something is set.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.559
- Sorry about that, Josh.
- Oh, shit!

04:41.560 --> 04:43.559
- No problem. Don't worry about it.
- What is this?

04:43.560 --> 04:46.799
- What did you do to this?
- What is what?

04:46.800 --> 04:49.079
This profile. You gutted it.
You totally gutted it.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.039
It was sappy and long-winded.
You practically went down on the guy.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.319
Went down on the guy? Okay,
you know what, Meyers?

04:54.320 --> 04:56.319
This is one of the great
directors of our time.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.879
I think he merits a little
praise in the lead.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.359
- It's an article, Stein, not a puff piece.
- It's a tribute.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.561
This is an artist. We can't
afford an adjective for him?

05:05.120 --> 05:07.239
Not one? I think it was a really
good piece. It was well written,

05:07.240 --> 05:08.919
- it was clear, it had heart...
- Stein?

05:08.920 --> 05:12.079
- Stein? Your phone is ringing.
- Yeah? What?

05:14.080 --> 05:17.204
Your phone is ringing.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.079
- Jessica Stein.
- Hey, Jessie!

05:21.080 --> 05:23.399
Oh! Hey, Danny. I'm sorry.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.759
- I got some news.
- Are you okay?

05:25.760 --> 05:27.759
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just...

05:27.760 --> 05:29.759
You can't tell Mom
and Dad yet, okay?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.759
- Yeah, okay.
- Are you sitting down?

05:31.760 --> 05:33.200
Uh-huh.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.850
I proposed to Rach!
I'm getting married!

05:40.920 --> 05:43.519
Wow!

05:43.520 --> 05:46.291
Wow.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.479
"It is not inertia alone

05:59.480 --> 06:02.759
"that is responsible for human
relationships repeating themselves

06:02.760 --> 06:04.759
"from case to case,

06:04.760 --> 06:08.567
"indescribably monotonous
and unrenewed.

06:09.520 --> 06:14.359
"It is shyness before any sort
of new, unforeseeable experience

06:14.360 --> 06:18.119
"with which one does not
think oneself able to cope.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.479
"But only someone who is
ready for everything,

06:21.480 --> 06:23.959
"who excludes nothing,

06:23.960 --> 06:26.479
"not even the most unenigmatical,

06:26.480 --> 06:31.083
"will live the relation to
another as something alive."

06:39.240 --> 06:41.799
God, this is great. This is great.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.039
I am so glad that you
asked me to do this.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.766
I mean, it was so bold of you
to come up to me at the gym.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.479
I mean, I thought I'd
finally give it a shot.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.439
Sometimes, you seem so
focused on your workout,

06:52.440 --> 06:55.359
- I wasn't sure if you'd talk to me.
- Oh, no.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.119
That's just the whole
gestalt of the gym thing.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.039
I mean, it's so
narcissistic and shallow.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.719
I think we all try to maintain a
certain anonymity while we're there.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.399
No, I have to disagree
with you there.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.399
I really love working out.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.399
I mean, granted, it is a little
narcissistic, as you say,

07:11.400 --> 07:14.159
but I really get a high, you know,

07:14.160 --> 07:17.011
from all those "endorphmins"
pumping and all.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.719
So, um, you're a writer.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.446
That's... That's amazing.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.999
- Hi. Hi.
- Hey! Hey!

07:26.000 --> 07:29.119
- I'm sorry I'm so late.
- No, you're right on time.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.519
- What? I'm an hour late.
- No, no.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.279
You are right on time.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.239
Hey, "tarbender,"
the lady'll have a...

07:37.240 --> 07:41.279
I will have a frozen strawberry
margarita with salt, please.

07:41.280 --> 07:45.399
Well, I see great
minds think alike.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.839
Uh, we split the salad. But I think,
as I recall, you ate a little bit more,

07:49.840 --> 07:54.719
including more of the arugula, which
is one of the more expensive greens.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.479
I didn't have any of the
goat cheese. I'm allergic.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.879
No dessert. Easy enough.

07:59.880 --> 08:05.079
That leaves your portion at
$42.73, and mine at $18.14.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.879
Beautiful. Perfect.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.605
You have exact change?

08:09.680 --> 08:11.919
It's so funny, Jessica.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.726
But I go out with a
lot of girls. A lot.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.799
And I just... I don't know.
I just feel so...

08:17.800 --> 08:21.439
So comfortable with you, so at
home, so free to be myself.

08:21.440 --> 08:25.239
Normally, I'm a pretty
"self-defecating" guy.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.439
Let me tell you something.
You're "phat."

08:27.440 --> 08:29.239
I'd love to see you
twirl in that dress.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.279
- With a P-H.
- Twirl.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.239
Oh, okay.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.599
- As it were, per se.
- I like the way your hair...

08:35.600 --> 08:36.759
Uh...

08:36.760 --> 08:38.239
goes around your head like that.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.558
- You know what I mean?
- You know? You know?

08:40.559 --> 08:43.279
- Whoops! I spilled some.
- What's not to get?

08:43.280 --> 08:46.719
I think we're connecting, and
I'd like to represent you

08:46.720 --> 08:48.879
as your accountant
and your boyfriend,

08:48.880 --> 08:52.323
if that's... That's
at all possible.

08:58.320 --> 09:02.279
Okay, the New Yorker loves us.
The reviewer is creaming in her pants.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.959
- So exhale, please. Okay?
- Okay.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.159
His back has been like
solid concrete all night.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.159
Your boyfriend has on his
serial killer face again.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.199
He's scaring some of the guests.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.399
He's been a little needy lately.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.639
I'll talk to him.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.879
Oh, hon. You are late.

09:17.880 --> 09:22.130
I'm sorry. My cab driver was
Ukrainian, and my Slav is only so-so.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.999
So you wanna do something later?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.719
- I'm gonna be at the library later...
- Oh, yeah?

09:27.720 --> 09:31.319
- ...In the 16th century archive, nude...
- Mm-hmm.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.879
With a bookmark dangling
precariously off of my dick.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.162
So I'll be waiting for you.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.159
Should I bring anything?

09:39.160 --> 09:41.279
Just your unbelievable body,

09:41.280 --> 09:44.643
and a photo I.D.
and a library card.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.207
- Pickup.
- Oh, yeah. It's right this way, please.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.799
<i>You're so ready now</i>

09:56.800 --> 10:00.049
<i>The fruit is ripe for takin'</i>

10:02.080 --> 10:04.399
Oh, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all day.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.399
They got me mad busy today.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.889
- Martin, where's Helen?
- Delivery.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.039
Wait. I'm still working.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.839
Sorry, sweetie. Line one.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.281
Jesus Christ. Okay. Got it.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.159
Helen Cooper.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.999
Why are you always doing these
things to destroy this relationship?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.239
We're not in a relationship.
We're in a situation.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.919
You have to stop right now.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.479
Yes, and I'm sure your
wife feels the same way.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.679
Listen, I gotta baby-sit this show.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.679
What are you doing later?
How's 11:00 for you?

10:36.680 --> 10:39.486
How's right now for you?

10:42.240 --> 10:45.479
Thanks very much.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.479
How does this art make you feel?

10:47.480 --> 10:50.759
Does it turn you on?
Does it make you hot?

10:50.760 --> 10:54.760
Does it scare you? Does
it minimize you as a man?

11:13.760 --> 11:16.199
- You're really gonna do this?
- I've decided.

11:16.200 --> 11:20.719
You've decided, or was it that article
in New York Magazine last month?

11:20.720 --> 11:22.759
- I've decided.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.159
I just think it's time, you know?

11:25.160 --> 11:28.719
- It's the one thing I haven't experienced.
- Of course it's time, sweetie.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.239
You go on with your frisky self,

11:30.240 --> 11:32.559
and don't let Mr. Fuddy-Duddy
piss on your parade.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.683
- Thank you.
- Mar?

11:35.120 --> 11:37.799
What is the problem?
She is trying new things.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.399
Sure. Today, sexual preference.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.079
- Tomorrow, Henna tattoos.
- Okay.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.599
So, let's see. Oscar
Wilde is too flip.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.725
Emily Dickinson is too trite.
It has to be just so.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.599
Maybe George Eliot.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.279
- Why do I have to have a quote again?
- Well, let's see.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.959
If it's brainy enough, it'll weed
out the real unwashed masses.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.759
And if it's well chosen,
you come across as someone

12:00.760 --> 12:03.519
who understands the plight
of your prospective partner,

12:03.520 --> 12:05.159
the plight of humanity.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.599
And by couching that understanding
in the words of a great writer,

12:07.600 --> 12:11.159
you appear sophisticated,
but earnest.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.119
- Grounded, but hopeful.
- Oh, my God!

12:13.120 --> 12:16.479
Sweetie, you're gonna have more pussy
than you know what to do with.

12:16.480 --> 12:19.599
- Here, take a look.
- Rilke?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.559
Rilke's very profound. Here.

12:21.560 --> 12:25.560
So the first thing you wanna do
is say, "For friendship or more."

12:26.320 --> 12:27.839
Wait. Why?

12:27.840 --> 12:30.640
Because then you have access to
all the bi-curious straight girls.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.119
Straight girls? But Bas...

12:33.120 --> 12:36.319
Trust me. Virgin flesh? Mangia.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.519
Bring that. Let's go.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.999
"Professional E-E, U-W-S,

12:41.000 --> 12:46.279
"V-G-L, N-S, D-W-M, seeking same."

12:46.280 --> 12:47.479
What could that mean?

12:47.480 --> 12:51.526
I'm not really versed in
single scene acronyms, so...

12:51.920 --> 12:55.319
- Listen to this one. This guy used a quote.
- That is so cheesy.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.359
"It is not inertia alone
that is responsible

12:57.360 --> 13:00.519
"for human relationships
repeating themselves.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.519
"It is shyness before..."
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.039
- This one stinks.
- Actually, I think it's Freud.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.719
Rilke. Uh, one of those, I think.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.879
Sorry. Guess I should read on.
"But only someone..."

13:13.880 --> 13:16.799
Does he describe himself?

13:16.800 --> 13:19.239
Esoteric quote man? Let's see.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.639
Oh, that's women seeking women.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.919
You know what, guys? Um, I
really have a lot of work to do.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.799
- Would you mind terribly...
- No. No, no, no.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.163
Thanks. Sorry.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.919
- Jess? Charles can make it tonight after all.
- Yeah.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.199
- So you're gonna get to meet him.
- Oh, good.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.199
That would be great. Thanks.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.959
Hey, Joan, is it okay if
I bring a date tonight?

13:49.960 --> 13:54.051
- Sure. The more, the merrier.
- Great. I'll see you tonight.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.208
You invited Josh? Ew!

14:12.480 --> 14:14.879
Hey, it's Hel.
Leave it at the beep.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.079
Hi. My name's Nan, and I'm
calling about your ad.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.199
I'm looking for someone with
a big heart, an open mind,

14:21.200 --> 14:22.839
and an adventurous spirit.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.039
Also, in the long term, I'm looking for
someone to mother a child with me.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.999
Would you be into that?

14:29.840 --> 14:32.399
- Be quiet. You get it.
- Come on. It'll be adorable.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.839
It's not adorable. You are
totally loving this, aren't you?

14:35.840 --> 14:38.759
Please. I'm 160 pounds
and I wake up vomiting.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.639
I have to live through someone.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.799
- Go. He's looking.
- This is embarrassing.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.606
- Okay. Be quiet.
- He's staring. It's gonna be weird.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.839
- Hi. I'm Charles.
- Hi.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.088
Jessica.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.559
Hey, it's Hel.
Leave it at the beep.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.759
Hi, Helen. I'm calling
about your ad.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.479
I would really like to meet
you as soon as possible,

15:02.480 --> 15:04.479
because you sound really special.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.599
And to tell you the truth,
I'm hangin' on by a thread here,

15:07.600 --> 15:09.879
and I could really
use someone special.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.367
So just call me, okay?

15:16.960 --> 15:20.239
<i>Sky's blue</i>

15:20.240 --> 15:24.570
<i>You know what I'm feeling
You know</i>

15:25.600 --> 15:30.442
<i>The very sweet sound
of your laughter</i>

15:33.200 --> 15:35.639
Oh, my God. Whatever. I'm so happy

15:35.640 --> 15:38.366
to be eating a meal with intelligent
people, you have no idea.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.639
That's us?

15:40.640 --> 15:43.639
I know, right? So thank you all
for not being freaks or morons

15:43.640 --> 15:45.679
or using words incorrectly.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.882
Bless you all.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.839
Tell me about it. Most
people I meet at the salon

15:50.840 --> 15:53.202
are totally "malcompetent."

15:55.200 --> 15:58.279
So, Charles, what about you?

15:58.280 --> 16:01.839
Have you had a horrible
time out there too?

16:01.840 --> 16:03.199
Oh, uh...

16:03.200 --> 16:05.639
- I don't know. I do okay.
- Yeah?

16:05.640 --> 16:07.968
Actually, I just met
somebody pretty special.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.559
Her name's Michelle.
And it's early, but...

16:14.560 --> 16:17.239
- I don't know. It feels right.
- Charles.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.603
I thought you were single.
Didn't you tell me that, honey?

16:22.840 --> 16:23.999
Uh, I thought so.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.999
I'm sorry. Is this
supposed to be a setup?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.879
No, no. No way. Not a setup.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.159
Just a friendly dinner.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.839
- Absolutely. Just a group of friends.
- Yes.

16:33.840 --> 16:37.119
Matthew and I just like to have
our friends know each other.

16:37.120 --> 16:40.119
Well, you know, Jessica, don't
worry about it. I mean, it's...

16:40.120 --> 16:42.199
We've all been through it.
It's just a jungle out there.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.279
Yeah, especially for Stein. I mean,

16:44.280 --> 16:47.759
she always has trouble meeting
people who are good enough for her.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.839
Yeah. God, I wish I
had your luck, Josh.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.919
I see you have no trouble
meeting people of your caliber.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.919
You know, Stein, why don't
you cut yourself a break?

16:55.920 --> 16:58.159
It's obviously not the time
to be meeting someone anyway.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.599
- Really? What? Not the season?
- No.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.326
It's just because you're
clearly not open to it.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.358
Excuse me? I'm sorry.
How would you know?

17:07.359 --> 17:09.959
Well, I do have a little
history to draw from.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.959
But even if I didn't,
you've known Charles here

17:12.960 --> 17:14.959
for about an hour,
and in that time,

17:14.960 --> 17:17.319
you've insulted and
dismissed a panoply of men

17:17.319 --> 17:20.039
based on factors as reductive
as a linguistic misstep,

17:20.040 --> 17:24.319
a different view from yours on going Dutch,
a kind reaction to your legendary lateness,

17:24.319 --> 17:26.959
and a genuine interest in yoga.

17:26.960 --> 17:31.319
You know, I think it was
Anais Nin who said,

17:31.320 --> 17:33.759
"We don't see things as they are.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.759
"We see things as we are."

17:35.760 --> 17:38.599
Generally, I'm not
much of a Nin fan,

17:38.600 --> 17:42.319
but I do feel that bit
sums you up to a Stein.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.799
So I don't think the problem's
with these poor men,

17:44.800 --> 17:46.359
these freaks and
morons, as you put it.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.722
I think the problem is with you.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.723
Jessica?

18:26.360 --> 18:27.959
Jessica? I...

18:27.960 --> 18:30.999
- Hi. I was just looking for you.
- Hi.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.319
- Helen. Hi.
- Right. Hi.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.679
- Good to meet you.
- I'm sorry I'm so late.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.879
- I'm always late.
- Don't worry about it. Come sit.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.879
I hope you didn't wait long.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.879
No. Well, I was just
starting to get worried

18:41.880 --> 18:47.479
- that maybe you weren't gonna show at all.
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:47.480 --> 18:48.806
Um...

18:49.080 --> 18:51.123
Helen, right?

18:51.640 --> 18:53.759
You know, gosh. I should've
said this on the phone

18:53.760 --> 18:55.999
and I didn't, and...

18:56.000 --> 18:58.328
I'm sorry that I didn't, but

18:58.920 --> 19:03.489
you should really know
that this isn't me.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.370
- It isn't?
- Not at all.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.888
I'm sorry.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.119
Taxi!

19:22.080 --> 19:24.399
- Shit!
- Which part of it isn't you?

19:24.400 --> 19:26.599
Oh, uh, all of it.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.399
So why did you...

19:28.400 --> 19:30.399
Yeah, you know what? The truth is,

19:30.400 --> 19:33.079
I've been trying to be a little less
me lately, and that's why this.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.009
But, really, I'm still me, see?

19:35.240 --> 19:37.279
I see. Well, look.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.159
We don't have to do a whole big...
We could just get a drink.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.079
- Yeah, I don't think so. Taxi!
- Oh, come on.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.279
You don't wanna go to
your dinner so frazzled.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.719
My... Oh, my dinner. Right. Right.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.279
Yeah, I think a little red wine
would really help to, you know...

19:51.280 --> 19:53.399
Look, you seem really nice.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.159
I just... I made a mistake.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.328
I have to go.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.919
Oh! Oh, my...

20:06.920 --> 20:09.839
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.799
- Oh, God. I... You know what?
- Don't be silly.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.799
- I...
- Let me help you.

20:14.800 --> 20:20.159
I missed my yoga class this morning,
and I'm not my usual centered self.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.479
Do you do... Do you
do yoga regularly?

20:22.480 --> 20:25.359
- Is that something...
- Yeah, yeah. Every day, actually.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.319
I find it keeps me really
strong and energized,

20:28.320 --> 20:30.319
and usually graceful.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.319
Right. I've heard that.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.639
- Have you never tried it?
- Oh, no, no, no.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.319
I don't think I could sit
still and breathe for long.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.319
- I'd panic.
- So what do you like to do for exercise?

20:40.320 --> 20:43.719
Oh, um, I like basic exercise.

20:43.720 --> 20:46.999
I like to run or walk. Just
keep moving, you know?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.479
I feel like as long as
I'm moving, I'm safe.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.399
- What do you do when you're sleeping?
- I'm a terrible insomniac.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.439
I'm so sorry. Since when?

20:54.440 --> 20:56.839
I don't know. Birth.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.639
Well, listen, if you ever change
your mind and wanna try a class,

20:59.640 --> 21:01.679
- I'd be happy to...
- Yeah, I don't think so.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.319
Well, don't decide right now.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.046
Just let it marinate for a while.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.486
Um...

21:09.680 --> 21:10.919
Okay.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.600
I will let it "marinate."

21:17.040 --> 21:19.208
I am never gonna get a cab.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.519
Maybe just one drink.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.406
Okay, just... I have,
like, 20 minutes.

21:28.520 --> 21:32.039
Well, wait, wait. This Larry,
that must've been pretty serious,

21:32.040 --> 21:35.239
- if he proposed?
- No, no. I mean... No, it was.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.239
- It was.
- Well, what happened?

21:37.240 --> 21:39.519
I... it wasn't right.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.559
He just wasn't funny, you know?

21:41.560 --> 21:44.039
- Bummer.
- I think that's been my big thing.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.926
Not smart or not funny, or
not smart and not funny.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.559
Or smart,

21:50.560 --> 21:53.759
but funny in a totally
unappealing way.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.879
You know? Just like
funny/stupid, or funny/dopey,

21:55.880 --> 21:59.719
but not funny/witty or funny/ironic
or funny/goofy, you know?

21:59.720 --> 22:03.879
Or they seem smart, and then you
realize that they aren't at all.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.448
And that's funny, but funny/tragic.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.641
Hmm.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.439
So anyway, if you're
then lucky enough

22:13.440 --> 22:16.399
to find someone who's the good kind
of smart and the good kind of funny,

22:16.400 --> 22:18.967
then generally they're
just kind of...

22:19.440 --> 22:22.399
- Ugly.
- Ugly.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.839
Ugly. I'm sorry.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.439
- Yes, a little. Is that... That's awful, right?
- No.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.439
Ugly doesn't do it
for you. That's okay.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.119
- Me, I'm kind of into ugly.
- What?

22:31.120 --> 22:33.279
As long as it's sexy-ugly.

22:33.280 --> 22:36.319
Sexy-ugly? I... Define.

22:36.320 --> 22:40.491
Well, you can't. It just is,
you know? Sexy-ugly.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.599
Okay, well,

22:42.600 --> 22:45.639
could you... Could you
give me a celebrity

22:45.640 --> 22:48.039
- who would fall into the category?
- Yeah.

22:48.040 --> 22:51.926
Hold on a second. I'll get you one.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.039
Angelica Huston?

22:54.040 --> 22:57.359
- Is that kind of the right idea?
- Yeah, I guess.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.279
I was gonna say Mick Jagger.
He's the big one.

23:00.280 --> 23:05.202
Lyle Lovett, James
Woods, Harvey Keitel.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.119
Very sexy-ugly.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.199
- Oh.
- Yeah.

23:09.200 --> 23:13.007
So, uh... So you're not...

23:13.960 --> 23:18.688
I mean, you've-you've tried...

23:19.280 --> 23:21.528
You've dated men.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.479
- Of course.
- Oh, good!

23:24.480 --> 23:26.599
- What?
- Good. I'm... No, I'm relieved.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.964
I just... I assumed that you had...

23:32.440 --> 23:35.405
Oh, I have, also.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.759
Yeah, I...

23:37.760 --> 23:40.361
I just find a lot of
different things sexy.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.839
Oh.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.883
I don't.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.719
So, should we settle the tab?

23:47.720 --> 23:51.208
- What?
- Yeah, it's 8:10. Don't you have a...

23:51.520 --> 23:53.199
- Oh, uh, no.
- You don't?

23:53.200 --> 23:55.926
- No. I lied.
- But I thought...

23:59.280 --> 24:01.289
I know a great Indian place.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.199
- Helen? Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah?

24:06.200 --> 24:09.006
- Sure.
- What color lipstick are you wearing?

24:09.040 --> 24:12.403
Well, it's three different
kinds. I blend.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.199
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.359
- Really? Wow.
- Would you like to know the...

24:17.360 --> 24:18.919
Would you feel comfortable?

24:18.920 --> 24:20.519
- No, of course.
- Is that something...

24:20.520 --> 24:24.159
I'd love to share. I start
with Mac Viva Glam Ill,

24:24.160 --> 24:25.679
- which is a great base.
- Right.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.359
And then I add Prescriptive's
Poodle on top.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.679
I love Prescriptive's.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.279
- Isn't it the best?
- It has the best texture.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.879
The moisture and the spray.

24:31.880 --> 24:37.039
And then I finish with Philosophy
Supernatural Nude, which is more of a...

24:37.040 --> 24:39.759
- Of a glossy kind of thing?
- Exactly. For the shine.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.239
Right. Right. Wow.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.759
- That's it.
- Wow.

24:44.760 --> 24:48.239
Well, it looks just
beautiful on you.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.839
Oh, thank you. Hey, you
should try it yourself.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.079
It would look gorgeous
on your complexion.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.519
Oh, thank you. But...

24:55.520 --> 25:00.799
Yeah, the blending thing is a little
labor-intensive for me, you know?

25:00.800 --> 25:03.199
I'm kind of looking for that one.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.519
Well, you'll never find it.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.848
I'm telling you, blend.

25:09.440 --> 25:12.959
- All right, so tell me again.
- Okay.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.639
- Roland, Steven and Craig...
- Greg.

25:15.640 --> 25:21.131
Greg. Right, okay. And...
Do you have a favorite?

25:22.440 --> 25:24.961
No, not particularly.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.959
Well, does one of them get
more time than everyone else?

25:29.960 --> 25:32.401
- Or, you know, a favorite one?
- No.

25:33.920 --> 25:37.679
I mean, basically, I call
Roland when I'm hungry,

25:37.680 --> 25:41.009
Steven when I'm bored,
and Greg when I'm horny.

25:41.120 --> 25:45.006
- Who do you call when you're sick?
- I don't get sick.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.119
Good system.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.799
That's crazy!
Who doesn't do E-mail?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.999
I hate computers. I object to them.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.119
- But you must use them at the office.
- Yes.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.879
At work I'm forced to,
but never at home.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.959
I mean, even at the office I don't
send E-mails. I just receive them.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.639
But... But...

26:03.640 --> 26:04.759
What?

26:04.760 --> 26:06.799
Have you discussed this
with your therapist?

26:06.800 --> 26:08.799
Oh, no.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.839
- There's too much on the agenda already.
- Like what?

26:11.840 --> 26:14.479
Um, just the usual.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.759
Older, nothing to show for it, no kids
or anything, why am I on the planet?

26:17.760 --> 26:20.400
Like that. God, they're so crazy.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.604
- No more so than anyone else.
- What?

26:24.680 --> 26:26.119
A little more so, I'd say.

26:26.120 --> 26:29.559
- I don't think so.
- But they are, objectively.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.559
I think they're, you know,
just doing their thing.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.079
They don't do anything.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.519
They play the tambourine all
day and ask people for money.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.722
- They have no goals.
- I think they have a pretty lofty goal.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.239
Really? What? New robes?

26:40.240 --> 26:42.519
- Spiritual enlightenment, happiness.
- Come on.

26:42.520 --> 26:45.279
- They're weird. Look at them.
- They're happy.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.599
- They're happy.
- What?

26:46.600 --> 26:50.319
Some people smoke pot. Some people
bungee jump. Some people chant.

26:50.320 --> 26:55.799
- What do you do to be happy?
- Nothing. I'm not. Wait, wait, wait.

26:55.800 --> 26:59.359
I have a job. I mean, I'm
accomplishing something in the world.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.119
Oh, really? What are
you accomplishing?

27:01.120 --> 27:03.319
I'm bringing the news to people.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.239
You know, information?
I'm being a grown-up.

27:05.240 --> 27:08.039
I'm not just out for me and my
enlightenment. What they do is selfish.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.439
Selfish? They are dealing
with their stuff

27:10.440 --> 27:12.039
and the energy they put
out to the universe.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.239
That's a lot more valuable than
being miserable all the time.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.759
Wait a second. I'm sorry.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.879
Are you saying that
my life has no value?

27:19.880 --> 27:23.399
No! I am saying that maybe
underneath all the neurosis,

27:23.400 --> 27:27.319
you have a profound capacity for happiness
that you're not allowing to exist.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.119
- How do you know? You just met me.
- You can't possibly know

27:30.120 --> 27:32.399
who you are or how you'll respond
to something until you try it.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.919
I happen to disagree. I happen to
think if you know yourself well,

27:34.920 --> 27:36.799
you can gauge how you're
gonna react to something.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.079
And I can pretty much assure you
that I will never be made happy

27:39.080 --> 27:41.159
by chanting for spiritual
enlightenment.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.039
- Or maybe you would. You can't know.
- Trust me. I know.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.039
- You know?
- Yeah, I know.

27:46.040 --> 27:49.369
- You know how you'll react to everything?
- Pretty much, yes.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.239
I guess you're right.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.488
You seem to know
yourself pretty well.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.959
Come on. Since when does she
care about what I think?

28:12.960 --> 28:16.959
Josh, she left before dessert.
I think she was a little upset.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.319
Well, did you talk to
her over the weekend?

28:18.320 --> 28:19.519
I left her three messages.

28:19.520 --> 28:22.519
She didn't return any of my calls.
I think she's devastated.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.519
Hey, you guys!

28:24.520 --> 28:27.199
I brought doughnuts.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.879
Look, Stein, you know, I just wanna
apologize for what I said on Friday night.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.999
Oh, hey, no problem. You had an
opinion and you expressed it.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.363
- Maybe you were right.
- No, I mean, really. I mean, who am I to...

28:52.080 --> 28:53.319
What did you say?

28:53.320 --> 28:55.602
I said, maybe you were right.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.959
Right. Glad there are
no hard feelings.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.999
- Yeah. Hey, Josh?
- Yeah.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.319
Do you ever use
"marinate" as a verb?

29:04.320 --> 29:08.286
I mean, no, not as a verb. As a verb
in other arenas than food preparation?

29:08.480 --> 29:10.679
- What do you mean? Like, "To sit with"?
- Right, right, right.

29:10.680 --> 29:14.248
To sit with something.
To let something marinate.

29:14.360 --> 29:17.211
- No.
- Oh. I love it.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.965
You know what?

29:46.200 --> 29:47.890
Don't worry about it.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.679
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.679
- Hi. Come in, please.
- Hi.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.879
- Thank you.
- Hi.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.599
- Hi.
- Wow.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.359
- You look great.
- No, thank you.

30:07.360 --> 30:10.559
No. You-You do.
I'm a mess, actually.

30:10.560 --> 30:13.559
- Those shoes are gorgeous.
- Oh, thanks for noticing.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.559
- Are they Nine West?
- No, Kenneth Cole.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.959
- You're kidding!
- No.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.559
Well, they're very sexy.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.919
They suit you.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.559
Uh, can we cut to the
chase for a sec?

30:25.560 --> 30:28.159
Just get the hard
topics out of the way.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.567
Sure. What's on your mind?

30:31.040 --> 30:33.079
Well,

30:33.080 --> 30:35.079
it's just that

30:35.080 --> 30:39.159
whenever I've thought about
lesbianism in the past,

30:39.160 --> 30:41.159
I've always said, "Ew," you know?

30:41.160 --> 30:44.239
Just, "Ew. Can't go there.
Can't get excited."

30:44.240 --> 30:47.279
- I mean, what would we do? You know?
- Right, right.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.999
- I mean, this is your big issue.
- Right, right.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.399
But I had such a wonderful
time with you the other night.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.679
- Me too.
- I really did.

30:55.680 --> 30:59.719
And I've been marinating on things.

30:59.720 --> 31:03.481
And, um... Anyway...

31:03.920 --> 31:07.759
I have taken the liberty of getting some
informational materials on the topic,

31:07.760 --> 31:10.399
- and I wondered if I might...
- Of course.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.959
Okay, okay. Well...

31:12.960 --> 31:16.119
This one leaflet was
particularly intriguing to me,

31:16.120 --> 31:17.639
Lesbian Sex: Hot, Safe and Sane.

31:17.640 --> 31:21.559
- Do you know it?
- Uh, no. But please, share.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.559
- I'd love to see it.
- Okay.

31:23.560 --> 31:27.359
Well, I was surprised to learn
that lesbians accessorize.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.039
I didn't know that.
So, for example,

31:30.040 --> 31:32.839
on page 11, I dogeared it,

31:32.840 --> 31:38.763
they show some of the higher-tech
lesbian accoutrement.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.199
Wow.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.439
- Wow.
- Yeah.

31:45.440 --> 31:50.319
So, gosh, how would this work?

31:50.320 --> 31:53.959
Well, I think I would
just strap that on and...

31:53.960 --> 31:55.519
Oh, no, no, no. That's not fair.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.039
We should certainly trade
off and share the load

31:58.040 --> 32:00.599
in terms of giving and receiving.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.679
But that doesn't address the actual
gross-out factor, if you will.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.439
No offense. No offense.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.159
- No, none taken.
- Okay, 'cause, I mean, look at you.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.519
Who wouldn't wanna have
sex with you, right?

32:10.520 --> 32:13.039
I mean, do you. But...

32:13.040 --> 32:15.839
Look, Jess, let's not put the
cart before the horse here

32:15.840 --> 32:19.999
with all the high-tech stuff, you know,
'cause we don't need any of that.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.804
We don't?

32:23.720 --> 32:25.799
I myself have always preferred

32:25.800 --> 32:29.279
the standard, organic,
old-fashioned way.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.086
Right. You're right.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.679
So that'd be just...

32:34.680 --> 32:37.719
- Thank you.
- Well, it's basically the same as with a man,

32:37.720 --> 32:40.639
except minus one thing, you know?

32:40.640 --> 32:42.839
Right, right. Yes, well, right.

32:42.840 --> 32:46.039
And let's face it, it's the other stuff
that works for women anyway, right?

32:46.040 --> 32:49.767
Yes, well, that is, um...
That is true.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.965
Cheers.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.319
Nice place.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.679
Thanks.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.719
<i>It feels so good</i>

32:57.720 --> 33:01.003
- Is that Barry White?
- No.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.408
<i>Oh, what a groove</i>

33:09.600 --> 33:12.079
- I'm gonna have to go slow, okay?
- Oh, okay.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.599
- Whatever you need.
- Okay, great.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.639
- Okay. It's okay.
- Sorry.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.161
<i>My hands just won't keep still</i>

33:23.400 --> 33:25.599
<i>I love you, baby</i>

33:25.600 --> 33:27.919
- Is this with tongue?
- Uh...

33:27.920 --> 33:30.359
I think we should
just play it by ear.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.919
- Just see how it goes.
- Okay.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.439
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.119
Great.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.641
<i>You got a blue eye</i>

33:40.720 --> 33:43.399
<i>It's deeper than any blue</i>

33:43.400 --> 33:46.001
<i>As for the green one</i>

33:46.520 --> 33:47.959
- Is that too much?
- Sorry.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.199
- Just a bit. Sorry.
- Okay, sorry.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.006
- But it was good up until then, right?
- Yeah.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.599
- Oh, my God! Please don't do that.
- That was just your stomach.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.519
I know. I can't do
that ever, really.

34:00.520 --> 34:03.239
- Even with a man.
- Oh.

34:03.240 --> 34:06.279
Wow. Okay. Okay.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.880
- Maybe let's just...
- Okay.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.958
That was really good!

34:18.960 --> 34:20.799
I thought that was, you
know, the best one ever.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.199
Me too. Definitely.

34:22.199 --> 34:25.210
Oh, those crazy eyes

34:26.639 --> 34:29.319
So, I figure if we
keep going like this,

34:29.320 --> 34:32.319
we'll get there in,
like, two weeks or so.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.759
Yeah, sure.

34:34.760 --> 34:36.839
- There's no real rush.
- Are you sure?

34:36.840 --> 34:39.079
- Yeah, sure. Not at all.
- But you'd really...

34:39.080 --> 34:40.958
- How about ten days?
- Ten days is better.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.083
Okay, good.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.159
What does your therapist
say about all this?

34:46.159 --> 34:48.359
- I could never tell my therapist.
- Why not?

34:48.360 --> 34:50.688
Because it's private.

34:51.639 --> 34:52.799
It's not working out.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.319
- I thought you said you really liked her.
- I did.

34:55.320 --> 34:58.479
- I do. It's just not working out.
- Why not?

34:58.480 --> 35:00.559
- Because she's a cock tease!
- Oh, my.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.879
I mean, a tease.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.879
- A poon tease.
- Right. Right.

35:05.880 --> 35:09.399
And she's nervous and
neurotic and straight

35:09.400 --> 35:11.679
and not that into it,
and I don't have time.

35:11.680 --> 35:14.839
I took out an ad, for Christ's sake, and
I end up with the Jewish Sandra Dee.

35:14.840 --> 35:18.159
What are the odds? Who do you have to
blow to get some pussy around here?

35:18.160 --> 35:20.839
- You know, enough is enough.
- On to the next.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.759
- Onwards and upwards.
- Right, right.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.639
Plus, she doesn't even get it.
She thinks it's going great.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.599
Schuller Gallery. Hi.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.959
Hi. How are you?

35:32.960 --> 35:35.719
Yeah... No, that's fine.

35:35.720 --> 35:40.599
Why would I mind?
No, 8:00 is perfect.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.359
Okay, I'll see you there.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.599
Bye.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.041
Is she 12?

35:50.880 --> 35:52.119
You a little jumpy today, Stein?

35:52.120 --> 35:53.999
- No.
- You got a hot date.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.879
- No.
- Yeah. Who's the guy?

35:56.880 --> 35:59.919
- There is no guy.
- Come on. You're a terrible, terrible liar.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.599
Trust me. There is no guy.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.959
<i>When the special girlfriend</i>

36:04.960 --> 36:07.639
<i>Meets a special girlfriend</i>

36:07.640 --> 36:08.919
<i>For a little shopping</i>

36:08.920 --> 36:12.239
<i>Shop-to-shop they're hopping
Shopping without stopping</i>

36:12.240 --> 36:14.759
<i>There's no greater pleasure</i>

36:14.760 --> 36:17.039
<i>Than to shop together</i>

36:17.040 --> 36:19.439
<i>And the special girlfriend
tells the special girlfriend</i>

36:19.440 --> 36:21.679
<i>You're my special girlfriend</i>

36:21.680 --> 36:23.799
<i>Oh, you're my favorite girlfriend</i>

36:23.800 --> 36:26.439
<i>My sweet and pretty girlfriend</i>

36:26.440 --> 36:29.439
<i>I trust you, my girlfriend</i>

36:29.440 --> 36:31.679
<i>To keep our secrets girlfriend</i>

36:31.680 --> 36:33.919
<i>When the special girlfriend</i>

36:33.920 --> 36:36.239
<i>Meets a special girlfriend</i>

36:36.240 --> 36:38.799
<i>With great tenderness she'll
tell her friend she's special</i>

36:38.800 --> 36:43.519
<i>Oh, my special
Oh, my special girlfriend</i>

36:43.520 --> 36:46.759
<i>So, what does my special
girlfriend say about that?</i>

36:46.760 --> 36:48.919
<i>Well, I can only tell you one thing</i>

36:48.920 --> 36:51.799
<i>If I didn't have you,
we'd get on so well</i>

36:51.800 --> 36:55.163
<i>- We'd get on so awfully well
- How well we'd get on together</i>

36:57.440 --> 36:58.639
Sorry.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.279
Please take me with you.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.639
I'm strong. I can stand
anything you can.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.759
It's too much for a woman.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.679
Too much for a woman?

37:07.680 --> 37:10.042
Put your arms around me, Tom.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.639
We should've seen Gimmie Shelter.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.999
I know, I know.
What were we thinking?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.519
Look, are you sure you don't mind?
My office is really close.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.079
It'll only take a second. What?

37:22.080 --> 37:24.203
Guy on stoop.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.999
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.319
Wow. I get it.

37:33.320 --> 37:36.524
- Sexy-ugly.
- I still could never.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.404
It's part of my reading series.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.370
- Shit. Shit. What is he doing here?
- Who?

37:44.840 --> 37:47.679
Nobody. My boss. Come on. Shh.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.199
Right over here.

37:50.200 --> 37:53.079
Hey, Stein. I just can't
keep you out of here, can I?

37:54.480 --> 37:55.799
Hi.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.919
- I'm Josh Meyers.
- Helen Cooper. We're just...

37:57.920 --> 38:00.248
Friends from the gym.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.679
Stein has the pleasure
of working for me.

38:02.680 --> 38:06.399
So you must be that "complete
asshole" she's always talking about?

38:08.040 --> 38:09.679
Don't mind her.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.599
She's just working out some
residual anger from college.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.199
- You guys went to college together?
- No.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.439
He went with my brother. I was a
freshman when they were seniors.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.919
- We dated for a year.
- Really?

38:19.920 --> 38:21.119
Mm-hmm.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.039
So, what happened?

38:23.040 --> 38:25.479
Well, she didn't think I was
living up to my potential.

38:25.480 --> 38:26.679
Which was what?

38:26.680 --> 38:28.359
She thought I was gonna
be the next Hemingway.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.359
Whatever. He was an
extremely talented writer.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.239
Now he's a professional "I" dotter
and "T" crosser. Let's just get...

38:33.240 --> 38:35.439
We thought Stein was gonna
be the next Georgia O'Keefe,

38:35.440 --> 38:38.279
but she's actually turned out to be
a pretty good "T" crosser herself.

38:38.280 --> 38:41.519
- Okay, a pleasure as always, Josh.
- You paint? I had no idea.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.959
I'm really a hack. I don't at all. We
can go. I just gotta get this one thing.

38:44.960 --> 38:47.039
Listen, can I just
use the bathroom?

38:47.040 --> 38:49.766
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. It's,

38:50.040 --> 38:53.559
through that door, and it's right at the
elevator, left at the water fountain.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.808
It's left at the water fountain.

39:06.840 --> 39:10.079
But it's not... There's no...
It's not, "You will be wise.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.119
"You will gain great wisdom through
some life-altering event."

39:13.120 --> 39:16.759
It's simply, "You are..."
What does yours say?

39:16.760 --> 39:19.719
- "Home is where the heart lies."
- Okay, you got an adage.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.719
- Well, so what? I like adages.
- You got an adage.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.039
The whole notion of the
fortune cookie is a sham.

39:24.040 --> 39:27.359
I mean, when does
anyone... Excuse me?

39:27.360 --> 39:28.559
When does anyone get a fortune?

39:28.560 --> 39:29.799
- I'd like to know.
- It's all right.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.199
I'm sorry. There are no
fortunes being dispensed here.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.639
- I mean, it's a misnomer...
- Hey, hey.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.683
Sorry to interrupt
this big debate here,

39:36.880 --> 39:40.879
but me and my friends over at the
bar have a little pool going.

39:40.880 --> 39:44.999
Basically, we wanna determine which
one of you is more beautiful.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.639
- Oh, right.
- Who won?

39:46.640 --> 39:49.319
You see, that's the thing. We're sittin'
over there scratching our heads,

39:49.320 --> 39:51.039
- 'cause it's close, you know?
- Right.

39:51.040 --> 39:54.919
We thought we'd come over here and buy
you some drinks, do some research.

39:54.920 --> 39:58.799
- I think we're fine, thanks.
- No, please join us. We would love that.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.399
What?

40:00.400 --> 40:02.799
Because we were just trying
to settle an argument too.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.919
- Really? What about?
- Well...

40:05.920 --> 40:08.639
- No, it's kind of weird.
- Come on. Tell us.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.639
Okay. We were just wondering

40:10.640 --> 40:13.159
whether a woman who's
only been with men

40:13.160 --> 40:16.045
could ever be sexually
attracted to a woman?

40:17.160 --> 40:19.519
What do you think?
Do you think she could?

40:19.520 --> 40:21.559
Well, hey, I think she
could. Definitely.

40:21.560 --> 40:25.479
- If she couldn't, she should.
- God!

40:25.480 --> 40:27.039
- What is that about?
- What?

40:27.040 --> 40:30.239
What is that male obsession with
lesbian sex about? I don't get it.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.479
You know what? You don't
have to answer that.

40:31.480 --> 40:32.639
Oh, come on!

40:32.640 --> 40:35.439
- It's just sexy, right?
- Yeah.

40:35.440 --> 40:38.759
It's kind of hard to describe. I mean,
a woman alone is sexy, God bless.

40:38.760 --> 40:41.719
But two women together
is like... It's like...

40:41.720 --> 40:43.639
- Double sexy.
- Right.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.639
- Double sexy? Wow.
- Yeah.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.839
Wow. That's nicely put.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.679
Yeah, that, really is nicely put.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.039
But tell us exactly,

40:53.040 --> 40:55.799
exactly what is it about
two women together

40:55.800 --> 40:57.999
- that you find so exciting?
- Yeah.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.719
Come on. You know, their whole...

41:00.720 --> 41:03.924
Their whole thing, you know?
Like, the way they touch.

41:04.240 --> 41:07.284
Really? How do they touch?

41:08.040 --> 41:11.879
You know, when they... Well, a woman
is soft, so when they touch each other,

41:11.880 --> 41:13.999
it's, like, they're soft.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.319
Women really know how to touch.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.679
But what would they do, I wonder?

41:19.680 --> 41:21.439
Who cares what they'd do!

41:21.440 --> 41:24.166
Just two women's bodies
together is just hot!

41:24.360 --> 41:28.559
Their hips, their legs, their belly
buttons. I mean, it's all good.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.239
And obviously, two women
together would know how to...

41:31.240 --> 41:33.719
They know how everything
works in there.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.399
Like how what works?

41:35.400 --> 41:38.479
- Jess, what's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing.

41:38.480 --> 41:41.604
It's just I have a
slight leg cramp.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.919
You really should
get that looked at.

41:43.920 --> 41:47.719
- Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for the concern.
- No problem.

41:47.720 --> 41:51.919
You know what, guys? I think we
really, really have to get going.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.039
- Oh, no!
- Can't we get you a drink or something?

41:54.040 --> 41:56.799
No, no. You know what? I'm a little
worried about Jessica's leg.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.480
- Yeah.
- And I really think I should get her into bed.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.159
Well, it was nice meeting you.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.559
- Take care.
- Bye.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.359
You see? That's the
thing about women.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.479
They really know how to
take care of each other.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.519
Oh!

42:26.520 --> 42:27.919
Come on!

42:27.920 --> 42:31.039
Shit! Oh, my God. Are
you expecting somebody?

42:31.040 --> 42:33.163
- No!
- Fuck.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.799
Greg! Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

42:39.800 --> 42:41.319
I know you ain't been trying
to avoid me and shit.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.559
No, no.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.525
Hi. Hi. I'm Jessica.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.999
I'm Greg. How you doin'?
I'm sorry. I didn't...

42:48.000 --> 42:49.999
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.
I was just going.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.999
- No, wait! No, you're not.
- Yes, yes, yes, I was.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.799
We just saw a movie, Greg, and I was
just gonna use Helen's bathroom

42:54.800 --> 42:56.399
because the line in the
theater was so long.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.599
But I just did, so I'm good.

42:57.600 --> 43:00.719
And now I'm gonna get going,
so you guys should carry on.

43:00.720 --> 43:04.199
Wait, wait. Jess, you, um, forgot
that juicer you wanted to borrow.

43:04.200 --> 43:07.999
- So I'll just get it for you. Excuse us.
- What? No, no, I...

43:08.000 --> 43:09.639
What are you doing? We were
finally getting somewhere.

43:09.640 --> 43:12.479
I know. I felt it too. But what
if I couldn't get that back?

43:12.480 --> 43:13.599
What?

43:13.600 --> 43:15.679
Look, maybe we bit off more
than we can chew here.

43:15.680 --> 43:18.611
- No.
- I mean, you have needs. I get it.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.799
He's really hot. I think you should go
for it. I think you should just...

43:21.800 --> 43:24.519
No, no. Stop talking. Stop talking.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.439
I want him to leave and I
want you to stay, okay?

43:27.440 --> 43:29.319
- So I'm gonna go get rid of him right now.
- No, no, no.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.919
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, what if he leaves

43:31.920 --> 43:33.679
and then I chicken out again,

43:33.680 --> 43:35.679
and you don't get any and
I'm wracked with guilt?

43:35.680 --> 43:38.799
Helen, he's a sure thing
and I'm not, okay?

43:38.800 --> 43:42.049
So just have fun. I adore you.
We'll try again tomorrow.

43:43.640 --> 43:46.605
- Really nice to meet you, Greg. Bye.
- Yeah.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.481
<i>Love makes me treat you</i>

43:57.600 --> 44:01.239
<i>In the way that I do</i>

44:01.240 --> 44:04.808
<i>And gee, baby
Ain't I good to you</i>

44:07.520 --> 44:10.999
<i>There's nothing in this
world too good for a girl</i>

44:11.000 --> 44:13.519
<i>So good and true</i>

44:13.520 --> 44:17.122
<i>Gee, baby
Ain't I good to you</i>

44:19.600 --> 44:23.079
<i>Bought you a fur coat for Christmas</i>

44:23.080 --> 44:25.601
<i>A diamond ring</i>

44:26.000 --> 44:29.039
<i>A big Cadillac car</i>

44:29.040 --> 44:31.759
<i>And everything</i>

44:31.760 --> 44:34.039
<i>What makes me treat you</i>

44:34.040 --> 44:36.759
<i>The way that I do</i>

44:36.760 --> 44:38.883
How's the patient?

44:38.920 --> 44:40.884
This is so humiliating.

44:41.360 --> 44:43.599
It's best not to talk. Don't talk.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.719
Okay.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.879
You'll talk more for a change.

44:47.880 --> 44:50.279
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.

44:50.280 --> 44:52.439
You're getting funny. That must
mean you're feeling better.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.719
- Jesus. What's all this?
- Oh, options.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.843
I'm a big medicator.

45:11.960 --> 45:15.679
- Oh, my God. That's the best thing ever.
- Yeah.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.599
Jewish penicillin.

45:17.600 --> 45:18.847
Mmm.

45:19.320 --> 45:21.479
You have to give me the recipe.

45:21.480 --> 45:24.684
But you don't need it.
You don't get sick.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.999
No. A queen-size bed is perfect.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.999
No, nothing else. Wait a second.
There is something else.

45:43.000 --> 45:48.366
I need a lock and a "Do not
disturb" sign. Yeah, that's it.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.559
Stein, can I just talk
to you for a second?

45:50.560 --> 45:53.119
- No, I can't talk to you. I'm late.
- No, really.

45:53.120 --> 45:55.999
- I gotta go. I gotta go. Sorry.
- Okay.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.999
I just wanted to talk for a second.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.919
- Have a good weekend, sweetie.
- You too, sweetie.

46:00.920 --> 46:02.999
She is so seeing somebody.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.199
- Jessica Stein's desk.
- Yes, hello.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.399
I'm looking for my daughter.
Excuse me. To whom am I speaking?

46:11.400 --> 46:13.879
- This is Josh Meyers, Judy. How are you?
- Joshie!

46:13.880 --> 46:16.999
Joshie! I haven't
spoken to you in ages.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.039
Yeah, I know. It's been a
long time. How are you?

46:19.040 --> 46:23.245
How am I? I'm fantastic. I'm just,
you know, excited about the wedding.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.799
- The what?
- The wedding.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.923
Didn't Jessie tell you?

46:29.200 --> 46:30.561
Uh...

46:31.040 --> 46:33.208
No. No, she didn't.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.845
Daniel is getting married.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.559
Oh.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.967
Danny. Well, that's wonderful.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.199
Mazeltov.

46:41.200 --> 46:43.767
Thank you. I can't believe
that Jessie didn't tell you.

46:44.040 --> 46:46.479
You're invited, of course.
Not to worry.

46:46.480 --> 46:49.039
That's sweet of you,
Judy. You know...

46:49.040 --> 46:52.519
How is Danny? I haven't really
talked to him in a while.

46:52.520 --> 46:56.039
Dan is floating on air.
That's how he is.

46:56.040 --> 46:58.239
As a matter of fact, he's gonna
be here in a few minutes.

46:58.240 --> 47:00.199
He's flying in for...
Wait a minute.

47:00.200 --> 47:02.879
Wait a minute. You'll join
us for Shabbat dinner.

47:02.880 --> 47:04.570
You have plans?

47:12.200 --> 47:14.879
- Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
- Hi. Coming to get you.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.399
- What?
- Day ten. I got a hotel.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.599
Yeah. I... You know what?

47:19.600 --> 47:22.519
I can't. I have a train to catch.
Shabbat dinner in Scarsdale.

47:22.520 --> 47:25.559
- Cancel. Cancel.
- I can't. My brother's in town.

47:25.560 --> 47:27.683
Yes or no, lady?
I don't got all day.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.566
I gotta get out of here.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.799
Okay. You know what? You know what?

47:32.800 --> 47:35.119
Let's just... We'll talk
in here. I can't think.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.719
- But the hotel's right around the...
- We'll figure it out.

47:37.720 --> 47:39.719
I will get my act sorted out.

47:39.720 --> 47:42.599
What are those pants?
I'm so borrowing... Mom?

47:42.600 --> 47:44.439
Jessie, I just got off the phone...

47:44.440 --> 47:47.319
- I can't come. Something's come up.
- What?

47:47.320 --> 47:48.599
- No, no.
- Don't be silly.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.919
My new friend, Helen, the
one I've told you about,

47:50.920 --> 47:54.479
she just got last-minute
house seats to Cabaret.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.919
And you know I've been dying to
go, so what I'm thinking is,

47:56.920 --> 48:00.479
- I will come up first thing in the morning...
- No, no.

48:00.480 --> 48:04.959
You are coming tonight, and I will get
you tickets for Cabaret next week.

48:04.960 --> 48:07.079
No, Mom, that's impossible.
The run's sold out.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.319
What is she saying?

48:08.320 --> 48:10.639
- Is your friend right there? Put her on.
- Yes, she's right...

48:10.640 --> 48:12.959
- No. Mom... No, no, no.
- Jessica...

48:12.960 --> 48:14.639
- What?
- Just for a minute.

48:14.640 --> 48:17.366
Sweetheart, put her on
just for a minute, okay?

48:17.520 --> 48:19.239
- She wants to talk to you.
- Yeah.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.522
- You swear? You swear?
- Yes. Give it here.

48:21.800 --> 48:23.559
- Hello?
- Helen, darling.

48:23.560 --> 48:28.561
- It is so wonderful to finally talk to you.
- Yes, hello.

48:28.680 --> 48:32.159
I just happen to have a neighbor who's got
a son who was a swing in the production,

48:32.160 --> 48:35.839
and I know that I can get you the most
fantastic seats for Cabaret next week,

48:35.840 --> 48:37.839
which would be my pleasure.

48:37.840 --> 48:40.159
Not to mention the fact that the
lead, who is this really big deal,

48:40.160 --> 48:42.119
is out all this week. Can you
believe that? Because he's got

48:42.120 --> 48:44.759
these soft nodules
on his vocal chords.

48:44.760 --> 48:48.519
So it would be... it would be a
damn shame for you to go tonight.

48:48.520 --> 48:53.199
You know what you're gonna do? You are
gonna join us for Shabbat dinner.

48:53.200 --> 48:58.008
And we can finally meet. So I am
setting a place for you at this table

48:58.200 --> 48:59.559
as we speak.

48:59.560 --> 49:03.159
And my husband Sidney is gonna
pick you up at the train in an hour.

49:03.160 --> 49:07.410
- Okay, darling?
- Um, okay.

49:09.240 --> 49:11.079
What happened?

49:11.080 --> 49:13.726
Shabbat dinner in Scarsdale.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.965
Shit.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.839
Daniel, darling, you're
in your usual seat.

49:23.840 --> 49:26.999
Sidney, Stanley, if you would
sit here. Okay, sweetheart?

49:27.000 --> 49:28.679
That's right, Helen. Right there.

49:28.680 --> 49:31.440
Oh, and Jess? Would you sit here,
please, between Stanley and me?

49:32.280 --> 49:33.879
Okay, Mom.

49:33.880 --> 49:36.079
Stanley, it's just
lovely to have you here.

49:36.080 --> 49:38.719
- It's lovely to be here. Thank you.
- The pleasure is ours.

49:38.720 --> 49:42.479
And, of course, Helen. Oh, my God.
Jessie has told us so much about you.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.839
And it's wonderful that
you could make it.

49:44.840 --> 49:46.839
Thank you. It's lovely to be here.

49:47.960 --> 49:50.766
- Wait. Who could that be?
- Why don't you answer it?

49:51.520 --> 49:53.559
Meyers! What the hell
are you doing here?

49:53.560 --> 49:55.959
- I was invited to Shabbat dinner.
- By whom?

49:55.960 --> 49:57.525
By Judy.

50:00.240 --> 50:02.919
There he is! There he is!

50:02.920 --> 50:05.719
- How was traffic? I figured, I figured.
- It was bad.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.919
- How do you like that?
- How are you, buddy?

50:07.920 --> 50:09.759
- Good, man.
- Good to see you.

50:09.760 --> 50:10.919
Good to see you too.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.719
I think you know everyone
here except Stanley.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.559
- Stanley, this is Josh Meyers.
- Josh.

50:14.560 --> 50:16.599
- I didn't get your last name.
- Schoenberg.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.519
You don't know Helen,
Josh. This is Helen.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.359
Oh, yeah, hi. We met
the other night.

50:20.360 --> 50:21.919
- How are you doing, Helen?
- Good.

50:21.920 --> 50:26.439
So, Helen was just telling us
that this is her first Shabbat.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.919
It's okay. We can raise
the kids interfaith.

50:28.920 --> 50:30.599
I'm willing to bend.

50:30.600 --> 50:33.439
Well, I did go to a seder once.

50:33.440 --> 50:36.279
But that's about the extent
of my Jewish education.

50:36.280 --> 50:38.960
Well, we'll do our best to
represent all Jews everywhere.

50:38.961 --> 50:42.767
- Jessie, kiddush.
- Oh, yes. Okay.

50:44.280 --> 50:45.925
Sing, my love. Sing.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.363
- Amen!
- Good Shabbat!

51:01.560 --> 51:03.479
- And another one.
- Good Shabbat.

51:03.480 --> 51:05.479
- Good Shabbat.
- Good Shabbat.

51:05.480 --> 51:06.639
Good Shabbat.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.479
It does me such good to have
all of you at this table,

51:09.480 --> 51:11.399
especially my children,

51:11.400 --> 51:15.399
my beautiful son, who's
a fancy lawyer now,

51:15.400 --> 51:18.799
and then my daughter, who's the
big deal at the New York Tribune.

51:18.800 --> 51:20.919
- I'm a copy editor.
- It's a big deal to me.

51:20.920 --> 51:23.679
Is she not gorgeous, Stan? Look at
that punam. Look at that punam.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.291
- She is beautiful.
- Please!

51:25.800 --> 51:29.288
So Helen, Jessica tells us
you own an art gallery?

51:29.760 --> 51:31.679
Jessica leans toward hyperbole.

51:31.680 --> 51:34.679
I'm the assistant director at the
Schuller Gallery in Chelsea.

51:34.680 --> 51:37.879
- What kind of work do you show there?
- Contemporary abstracts, right?

51:37.880 --> 51:38.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

51:39.000 --> 51:40.850
I saw Diana Tompkins'
exhibit last month.

51:41.520 --> 51:44.639
And Stanley is the vice president
of new software development

51:44.640 --> 51:45.839
- for I.B.M.
- Yeah.

51:45.840 --> 51:50.199
So if you need a great deal on a new
P.C., just let me know. I'm your man.

51:50.200 --> 51:52.050
Jessica hates computers.

51:52.960 --> 51:54.039
Oh.

51:54.040 --> 51:56.679
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. That's okay.

51:56.680 --> 51:58.479
That's fine. I just, um...

51:58.480 --> 52:02.039
I just feel like they're numbing and
obscuring our humanity, you know.

52:02.040 --> 52:05.039
Angel, could you help me
in the kitchen, please?

52:05.040 --> 52:08.050
- Sure, Mom.
- Thanks.

52:08.800 --> 52:10.119
We'll be right back.

52:10.120 --> 52:13.051
- She likes to provoke.
- Oh, no. I understand. I like that.

52:14.040 --> 52:16.559
He's adorable, he is
bright, and what's more,

52:16.560 --> 52:18.999
he is your father's partner's
nephew, so you be nice.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.079
I don't wanna...
I don't wanna be nice.

52:21.080 --> 52:23.599
And for the record, all of your
setups have been disastrous.

52:23.600 --> 52:24.879
- Disastrous?
- Yes, they have.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.239
How was I to know Eric
Birnbaum was in rehab?

52:27.240 --> 52:29.399
God. Wan, pale, track marks?
I don't know.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.159
- I thought he had diabetes.
- Jesus Christ.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.919
- Can I help with anything?
- Yes, you can make my daughter

52:32.920 --> 52:35.600
a little less stubborn
and a lot less picky!

52:35.960 --> 52:37.919
- Tall order.
- Thanks.

52:37.920 --> 52:42.399
Let me ask you something,
Helen. Isn't Stanley gorgeous?

52:42.400 --> 52:45.479
Oh, yeah. He's a
handsome guy, Jess.

52:45.480 --> 52:48.119
Wouldn't he make a great match? He
would be a great match, wouldn't he?

52:48.120 --> 52:49.679
I think it's a very good match.

52:49.680 --> 52:51.919
And you know what?
I think Jess really likes him.

52:51.920 --> 52:54.805
Yes, yes, clearly. I'm smitten.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.599
Great. It's not happening.

52:58.600 --> 53:00.879
It's not happening, Mom.

53:00.880 --> 53:04.846
Breathe, Judy, breathe.
What about you, Helen?

53:06.280 --> 53:08.084
How do you like Josh?

53:08.920 --> 53:10.399
Oh, um...

53:10.400 --> 53:11.719
He's great,

53:11.720 --> 53:13.959
- but my plate's a little full right now.
- I can imagine.

53:13.960 --> 53:17.439
Beautiful girl like you, you probably have
men falling all over you left and right.

53:17.440 --> 53:18.559
I do okay.

53:18.560 --> 53:22.519
I just wish that Jessie
would meet somebody.

53:22.520 --> 53:27.119
It's been ages since she's met anybody
worthwhile. Is she dating at all?

53:27.120 --> 53:29.999
I think so. You know,
now and again.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.726
But no one special?

53:32.960 --> 53:34.764
You know, I just don't know.

53:34.800 --> 53:36.479
Keep me posted, will you?

53:36.480 --> 53:39.639
Sometimes, Jessie is
so secretive with me.

53:39.640 --> 53:41.719
- Would you do that for me?
- You know, I'm sure

53:41.720 --> 53:45.239
if it's someone really
special, she'll tell you.

53:45.240 --> 53:49.319
And our platform is compatible
with the new camera software.

53:49.320 --> 53:51.919
So soon, your local photo shop
will be a thing of the past.

53:51.920 --> 53:55.567
Judy, you hear this? They're putting
photocopiers in the computers now.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.479
- This technology's unbelievable.
- I know.

53:58.480 --> 54:01.639
- Stanley's a genius.
- Well, I didn't actually invent the thing...

54:01.640 --> 54:03.639
You're a genius. Potatoes?

54:03.640 --> 54:07.439
So, Helen, what groundbreaking
project is on your docket next?

54:07.440 --> 54:11.319
Well, actually, I'm curating a
show this summer for new artists.

54:11.320 --> 54:14.359
New artists? Well, Jessie's
work should be in that.

54:14.360 --> 54:15.519
- Mom...
- Have you seen her stuff?

54:15.520 --> 54:17.759
I haven't. Isn't that funny?

54:17.760 --> 54:18.999
- She is marvelous.
- Mom...

54:19.000 --> 54:20.999
That's her painting over there.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.599
She was the rage at Brown.

54:22.600 --> 54:25.441
- Jess, that's really good.
- Yeah, don't bother. She won't listen.

54:31.880 --> 54:35.839
All right, it's settled. No one's
leaving. The rain's terrible.

54:35.840 --> 54:39.567
We've got warm beds. Everyone
stays. Genug. Enough said.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.879
I hope you girls
don't mind sharing.

54:41.880 --> 54:44.199
No problem. We'll be okay.

54:44.200 --> 54:48.086
- Right, Jess?
- Yes. Um, yeah. We'll be fine, Mom.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.562
You sure it's big enough?

54:51.520 --> 54:55.327
- I think we'll just fit. Good night.
- Good night.

54:58.200 --> 54:59.919
- Stop it!
- You stop.

54:59.920 --> 55:03.681
- Kids. Good night, Stanley.
- Good night.

55:05.400 --> 55:09.082
Poor Stanley. Didn't know what
he was getting into, huh?

55:11.440 --> 55:14.079
- Those Stein women are tough to please.
- Yeah.

55:14.080 --> 55:16.567
It'd take a better man
than me, clearly.

55:17.880 --> 55:20.119
Well... So how's
your writing coming?

55:20.120 --> 55:22.599
Oh, you know. Not.

55:22.600 --> 55:24.959
What do you mean?

55:24.960 --> 55:27.959
I decided that I didn't really
wanna be a writer anymore.

55:27.960 --> 55:30.239
I'm much happier tearing down
the work of other writers

55:30.240 --> 55:33.799
who are not as talented as I
am, but also not as paralyzed.

55:33.800 --> 55:37.447
Any artistic frustration I have
now I just take out on them.

55:39.080 --> 55:42.079
Damn, man. You got dark.

55:43.160 --> 55:44.805
I know.

55:48.440 --> 55:51.211
This is so weird.

55:52.080 --> 55:54.647
In a month of such normalcy.

55:56.880 --> 55:59.651
Shh. We must be very quiet.

56:03.800 --> 56:07.368
Jesus Christ. I feel like we're
gonna be grounded or something.

56:23.520 --> 56:27.079
- Wait, Jess. What are you...
- Stop talking.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.521
It's day ten.

56:36.160 --> 56:38.799
Fuck. There's nothin' fucking on.

56:45.360 --> 56:48.370
Jesus. I was supposed to call Rach.

56:50.160 --> 56:52.359
- You okay down here, man?
- Yeah.

56:52.360 --> 56:54.359
Your mom left sheets.

56:54.360 --> 56:57.359
Okay. All right. Good night.

56:57.360 --> 57:00.006
Yeah, good night.

57:24.200 --> 57:27.643
- Jesus.
- Can I get some fries with that shake?

57:36.640 --> 57:39.799
Okay, enough is enough. You
never write. You never call.

57:39.800 --> 57:41.039
I don't know you anymore.

57:41.040 --> 57:43.159
Are we breaking up or are you
gonna tell me about him?

57:43.160 --> 57:46.799
- Oh, sweetie, no. I...
- Okay, we're breaking up.

57:46.800 --> 57:50.607
No, no, no, no. No, um, I...

57:51.600 --> 57:54.559
Okay. Yes, I've been
seeing someone.

57:54.560 --> 57:56.250
Duh.

57:56.840 --> 57:59.479
I just don't wanna jinx it...
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:59.480 --> 58:02.879
- I don't wanna jinx it by talking about it.
- You know what? Just jinx it.

58:02.880 --> 58:04.879
Yeah. Okay, just jinx it.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.079
When do we get to meet him?

58:06.080 --> 58:09.329
How about brunch on Sunday
if my water doesn't break?

58:09.400 --> 58:12.999
The thing is, we're kind of laying
low this weekend, he and I.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.044
But... But maybe next week.

58:16.200 --> 58:20.928
- Not maybe, definitely.
- Okay. Definitely.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.362
Knock, knock.

58:27.600 --> 58:29.370
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.719
Is everything okay?

58:34.720 --> 58:36.759
Yeah, why?

58:36.760 --> 58:40.279
You just... You don't seem
like yourself lately.

58:40.280 --> 58:43.802
Yeah, well, you know.
You don't either.

58:44.200 --> 58:45.279
Oh.

58:45.280 --> 58:47.642
Okay.

58:48.080 --> 58:50.199
Okay.

58:50.200 --> 58:53.324
- Hey. Did you get the wedding invite?
- Yeah.

58:54.520 --> 58:56.484
- They're beautiful, right?
- Yeah.

58:57.360 --> 58:59.959
- Yeah. It's great for Danny.
- Yeah.

58:59.960 --> 59:03.439
- We're excited.
- Well, you should be.

59:03.440 --> 59:06.291
Okay. Well...

59:11.400 --> 59:12.799
Why can't you be happy for me?

59:12.800 --> 59:14.879
Because you are an affront
to gay people everywhere,

59:14.880 --> 59:16.399
and I am a gay people.

59:16.400 --> 59:18.479
- Is it so hard to believe that I like her?
- Yes.

59:18.480 --> 59:20.479
- Why?
- Because you like the penis.

59:20.480 --> 59:22.679
Because you have had
more cock than I have,

59:22.680 --> 59:24.639
and I was a big whore in the '80s.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.639
I'm sorry, ma'am.

59:26.640 --> 59:27.959
Come on, come on.

59:27.960 --> 59:31.399
This is not something that you can
just try on and see if it fits.

59:31.400 --> 59:34.639
I can't just put black shoe polish
on my face and join a gospel choir

59:34.640 --> 59:37.039
because, I don't know, I
don't feel so white no more.

59:37.040 --> 59:40.039
- Come on. That's a terrible analogy.
- Why? Why is that?

59:40.040 --> 59:42.679
- Because you're born black.
- Exactly my point.

59:42.680 --> 59:47.204
Okay, so what do you think?
It's genius, right?

59:49.320 --> 59:50.519
Who died?

59:50.520 --> 59:53.159
Apparently, I'm an affront
to the gay community.

59:53.160 --> 59:55.319
Not this again, Martin.

59:55.320 --> 59:59.399
- Martin, why do you care who I'm with?
- Yes. Why do you care?

59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.799
- She likes this girl.
- Straight girl.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.839
Straight girl, gay girl.
What's the difference?

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.999
An orgasm is an orgasm.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.799
If you were blindfolded
and I blew you,

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.839
and then Helen blew you, would
you even know the difference?

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.879
I don't know. That depends. Does Helen
get tired and stop halfway through?

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.919
Okay, too much information. Guys...

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:20.119
That happened once, and you were so
drunk that you could hardly even...

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.879
Okay. You know what?

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:27.399
Look. The point is, this person
Helen's with seems lovely and smart.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.919
And a very talented artist
who's gonna be in our show.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.565
- Have you met her?
- Well, no.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.250
Why haven't we met her?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.079
How come you never make noise?

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.204
- What?
- When we're having sex.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.085
- What?
- Is it not good?

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.039
What? No, it's fine. It's... Yeah.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.079
'Cause I can never tell.
You're so quiet.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.079
And, you know, I make noise,
so you know what's working.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.359
Whatever you want
me to do, I'll do.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:11.007
- So if something's not working...
- You know, it's all fine. It's all just fine.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.599
Like sometimes when I'm going down
on you, it seems like you like it.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.839
But then sometimes it seems
like you're annoyed.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.959
Look, Helen...

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.799
You know what? It's not really the
right time to talk about things.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.759
But it's never the right time, especially
at the time, which strikes me as

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.639
- exactly the right time.
- My God, Jess, what are you doing here?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.799
- Oh, my God, Joan. Hi. Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.879
- What are you doing here?
- Shopping, of course.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.279
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.519
Hi. Joan, this is Helen,
a friend of mine.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.519
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.519
This is Joan, a friend of mine.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.279
What are you doing below 14th street?
I thought you were laying low.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.759
Yes, I was. I... We were.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.799
And then my friend Helen here

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.839
actually volunteers for
this homeless thing.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.319
And, she... I had promised to
help her make brownies today.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.923
And so we're getting ingredients
to make the brownies.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.599
You must make a
pretty good brownie.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.799
Lesbians?

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.079
Jesus Christ, I couldn't
think of one thing to say.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.319
- I couldn't think of anything else.
- I don't believe this.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.159
I know, I know, I know.
It's crazy, right?

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.319
It's like this surreal episode.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.839
Are you horrified? Are you?
Do you find me disgusting?

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.839
No, no, no, sweetie, no. God.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.839
- Are you sure?
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.559
- I'm impressed.
- You are?

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.159
I can't even get Matthew
to use the sex toys I buy.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.319
Oh, my God.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.759
And you're so conservative.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.759
Fuck you, I know. I know.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.359
- Does anyone else know?
- No. No! Are you crazy?

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.359
- Don't tell Josh.
- Yuck, no. No, I won't.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.759
No matter what you do, don't ever.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.199
- Okay? Shit.
- God, this is huge.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.679
It's so

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.719
- radical.
- I know.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.279
God. Tell me everything.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.927
How did you meet this person?
What... How did this...

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.639
Don't tell me.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:07.119
- You answered that ad! I don't believe it!
- No, no, no, no.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.519
- Oh, my God!
- I know, I know. I'm a liar and a hypocrite.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.959
- Jessica Stein!
- I know, I know. It was a whim.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.199
You know what? It was just a whim.
It was this wacky, nutty whim.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.399
I mean, you know that
I'm a Rilke fan.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.719
And I read that ad and I thought it would
be nice to meet someone, just as a friend.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.839
Oh, my God. It's all wrong.
It's all wrong. It's not me.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.679
I'm a Jew from Scarsdale.
This has got to stop.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.399
I gotta call her on the
phone and I gotta stop it.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.839
We have to pretend that it never...
Any... Nothing.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.681
- Stop. Shh. You're hysterical!
- No, I'm not.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.683
Breathe.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.239
What's she like?

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.439
She's great.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.567
She's kind and witty and

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.959
quirky and nurturing and
involved and all that crap.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.039
But she's a girl, you know?
She's thin.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.719
She has thin arms and she's soft
and attentive and it's all wrong.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.959
- How's the sex?
- It's good.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.839
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:13.559
- Does she make you laugh?
- Yeah, yeah, a lot. We laugh a lot.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.401
- Is she as smart as you?
- Yeah, definitely.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.359
- She gets you?
- She does.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.959
She really does. I mean,

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.926
I think the thing is
we just really click.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.599
- You know?
- Mmm.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.929
Sounds like you definitely
need to put a stop to this.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.399
Am I wearing this? This is so bad.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.399
For Rachel. You are
wearing this, my love.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.399
- All right. You look beautiful.
- I look beautiful?

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.399
Yeah, you totally look beautiful.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.799
- I look like a heifer in her fifth month.
- Oh, God.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.199
- You wanna eat?
- Yes, I'm starving. Let's get out of here.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.279
Good. I made a reservation just next
door. And I left a message for Helen.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.279
- What?
- There she is.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.479
What?

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.239
I left a message for Helen in
case she wants to join us.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.488
- Hi, dear. How are you?
- Hi.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.130
What's all this?

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.127
- Very funny.
- No, really, what's going on?

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.359
These are our dresses, sweetheart.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.610
For the wedding.
For Daniel's wedding.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.208
Didn't I tell you? My
brother's getting married.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.919
- No, you didn't.
- You didn't tell her?

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.442
- No, I did. I was sure that I had.
- When?

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.999
- When did I tell you?
- No, when is he getting married?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.409
Next weekend.
Didn't you get the invitation?

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.359
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God. Jessie.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.679
- I'm sorry.
- Jessie, what did I say? What happened?

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.479
Nothing, nothing at all. It's...

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:56.359
- Her brother died at his wedding...
- He died?

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.759
Yeah. I'm off. I'll
explain later, okay?

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.406
Her brother died at a wedding?

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.559
Please wait.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.119
Your brother's getting married
and you didn't tell me?

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.239
I was sure I told you.
I thought I told you.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.319
Stop saying you told me.
You're a terrible liar.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.799
It's one of your best qualities.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.719
- All right, please don't do this.
- Look. I am so tired of this.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.399
I am so tired of being left
out of half of your life.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.159
- We're in a...
- Shh.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.839
We're in a relationship whether
you like it or... Wait a minute.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.759
- Why am I whispering? This is the point.
- Okay, listen.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.079
We have been through this. I have never,
ever considered anything like this.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.719
But here we are. It's happening, and
it's good, and I'm not ashamed of it.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.127
And if you are, then
we have a problem.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.407
She hates that dress.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.439
Let's not get crazy, you know.
It is good. It's great.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.439
But I'm just not ready to deal
with the complexities of...

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.759
- God, you can't even say it.
- Say what?

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.479
I have never, ever imagined
doing anything like this.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.679
Well, you are doing something like this.
This didn't just happen to you.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.239
It did. I mean, it feels
like it did, you know?

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.719
I'm sorry. I can't just...

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.759
I can't be with you and
be intimate with you

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.439
and share wonderful
things with you,

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.639
and then get shut out of the
most basic things in your life.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.959
What is so terrible about
having privacy in this,

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.959
in taking our time to
see if it makes sense?

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.239
Because when you don't acknowledge
who I am to people that matter to you,

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.599
it makes me feel like
you're ashamed of me.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.079
I'm not ashamed of you.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.319
- Well, that's how it feels.
- God, what do you want from me?

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.364
I want you to take me to
your brother's wedding.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.089
I can't.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.847
I'm sorry. I just can't.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.446
Fine. I can't either.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.159
Hey, it's Jess. Leave me a message.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.359
Okay, we did it.
Hannah Claire Levine.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.919
Eight pounds, six ounces.
I'm sorry we didn't call sooner.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.039
It was 3:00 a.m. and it went
sort of fast, thank God.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:13.399
Because it's the worst pain one
will ever know. You can't imagine.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.999
I'm in room 325 at Sinai.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.038
Oh, my God. Can you believe?

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.207
Come by soon. Where are you?

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.719
The only woman that loved me
not just in spite of my faults,

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.968
but because of them somehow.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.879
I love you, Rachel.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.402
I'm gonna go get some air.

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:19.879
- Helen, hey.
- Josh. Hi...

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.241
Um...

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:24.238
God, you know, I'm flattered,
but it's really not a good time.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.238
They're for Jessica.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.487
Oh.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.604
Sorry.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.799
Well, I heard the opening was tonight
and wanted to wish her well. That's all.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:38.004
That's sweet, but,
um, she's not here.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.799
- You're kidding. Why not?
- Oh, she's got a lot going on.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.038
You know, wedding stuff,
rehearsal dinner.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.450
I am so stupid. Well, will
I see you there tomorrow?

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.884
No, you won't.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.168
Is that hers?

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.608
Yeah.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.243
Wow.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.919
That's a pretty powerful piece.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:15.968
Yeah. It's amazing that someone like
Jessica takes such risks in her work, huh?

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.964
She certainly doesn't
anywhere else.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.519
Beautiful toast.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.882
Yeah, it was.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.648
You okay?

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.006
Um...

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.881
I don't know. No.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.282
What is it, Jess?

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:27.930
It's just sometimes I think
I'm gonna be alone forever.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.447
You can jump in any time.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.759
You're my love, you know that?

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.008
My beloved.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.879
But sometimes I worry for you.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.606
I worry for me too.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.366
Sweetheart.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.399
I will never forget,

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.479
when you were in the fifth grade,

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.399
and you were so excited when
you got the lead in the play.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.239
Do you remember that?

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.523
- Really Rosie.
- Really Rosie, yeah. I remember.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.919
And you came home after the
first day of rehearsal,

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.919
and you turned to me
and you said, "Mommy,

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.439
"I'm not gonna do it. I quit."

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.399
Just like that.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.039
I turned to you and I said,
"Jessie. Jessie, my love, why?"

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.439
And you said, "Because my
costar isn't good enough."

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.519
"And if my costar
isn't good enough,

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.519
"then the play won't
be good enough.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:51.119
"And I don't wanna be part of any
play that isn't good enough."

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.005
And I thought to myself,

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:58.128
"Oy.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.159
"This Child will suffer.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.204
"How this child will suffer."

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.719
And then they gave it to the
mieskeit with the glasses.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.399
- Tess Greenblatt.
- Right.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.082
- God, she was terrible.
- Right. And you would have been great.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.319
And you didn't get to do it.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.079
You had to sit there and
watch terrible Tess do it

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.679
with that guy you thought
wasn't good enough,

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.399
who was actually quite
excellent, wasn't he?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.479
He was. He was very good.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.359
And you know?

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:34.839
I always think that you would have
been so much happier doing that play,

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.319
even if it was just okay.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.319
Even if it was great,

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.807
just not the best ever.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.883
And maybe,

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.559
just maybe,

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.639
it would have been the best ever.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.763
You never know.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.608
Jessie.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.848
Yeah?

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.643
I think...

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.124
I think she's a very nice girl.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.599
Hey, it's Jess. Leave me a message.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:10.319
Jessica. Hi, it's Josh Meyers.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.764
And, uh, I just wanted to...

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.639
God, I wish you were home.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.210
I'm wearing this. Do you have
any interest in this one?

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.805
Mazeltov.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:42.363
Aren't they great? Aren't they
gorgeous? Hello, darling.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.839
Hey, how's it going?

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.879
Are you the lesbian?

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.319
Helen, darling. We just
want you to know again

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.639
how welcome you are in our family.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.279
Right, Sid?

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.319
- I told her welcome three times already.
- Jesus.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.559
I've been hearing about "the one" for,
I don't know, like 20 years.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.959
And I thought it would be a guy.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.399
Right. I know, I know. But look,
I don't even believe that anymore.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.319
I don't believe there's
just one person.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.841
I think there are, like, seven.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.679
Fuck! Fuck, fuck!

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.639
- Are you okay? Is it horrible?
- I'm fine.

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.519
- Are you sure? Are you having any fun?
- Yeah, I am.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.121
The dress looks good.
I'm gonna be right back.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.159
- I don't know what she sees in her.
- Mother.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.279
- She's flat-chested.
- Jesus, mother.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.239
But at least you're
Jewish, right, dear?

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.839
- Uh, no, but I've been to a seder.
- Well, that's nice.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.679
Hey, guys, congratulations.
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.848
Congratulations.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.159
- Hey.
- Hey, Meyers.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.279
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Oh, why?

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:54.039
Well, just to, uh...
Did you get my...

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.759
- What?
- Nothing.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.519
- What, what, what?
- Nothing. It doesn't matter.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.639
Helen, dear, have you thought
about the kids issue?

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.119
I mean, you could of course each
try artificial inseminating.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.199
Could you excuse me for a minute?
I really have to pee.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.159
- Did you see the view?
- No. I haven't had a chance actually.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.091
Why don't we just go look at it?

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.124
- Hi, Helen.
- Oh, my God.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.684
Joan, hi.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.523
- Hi, sorry. I was just, um...
- I know. Do you smoke?

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.561
- No, I don't.
- Good. Neither do I.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.279
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.319
It's so beautiful.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.727
Yeah.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.239
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm fine.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.839
- Here. Why don't you take my jacket?
- No, really. I'm fine.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:56.639
Jessica. What?

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.399
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.119
I just...

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.244
I haven't heard you say my
first name in, like, a decade.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.960
Oh. Right. Sorry.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.650
- Stein, just take my coat.
- Okay, thanks.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.439
- It's just like kissing a guy.
- No, it's not.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.279
No, it's not.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.999
How's it different?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.282
Well,

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.399
the lips are softer and
the body's softer.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:32.640
And there's this nonthreatening
but very exciting...

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.199
It's kind of hard to describe.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.483
Wow. Wow.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.406
It's pretty fuckin'
awesome actually.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.443
Whoa.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.919
- Like, a year, right? And that's it.
- Who knows? An hour.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.319
And then you've impacted
the entire world.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.599
This is exactly...

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:05.159
I feel like I've always had this
theory along the same lines.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.679
It's really stupid, but I've
always felt if you could be

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.119
the guy or gal to come up
with a really good quote.

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.159
Right.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:16.159
But good, like a good one.
A good little nugget.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.439
Like, "Nothing to fear
but fear itself."

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.639
- That's a good one.
- Or, "Ask not what your country..."

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.999
And then you're done.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.959
I mean, that's like immortality
in one kind of lightbulb moment.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:31.119
You just go off to some Caribbean island
and drink all day and read and...

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.279
- What are you doing?
- Um, I just...

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.279
Hey, hey, hey, Meyers.
Take it easy.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:39.039
- We got plenty, you know. It's an open bar.
- Yeah. I just...

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.319
I know. I needed that
unfortunately badly because...

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.729
I have to tell you something
and it's just gonna be hard.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.081
Oh.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.039
Oh, my God. Are you firing me?

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.079
Is that why you brought up
the quitting and everything?

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.679
No, no. I'm not firing you.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.119
I went to see your show last night.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.199
And I brought you flowers because
I knew you were really sad.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.199
But, you know, the truth is that
you've been really happy lately.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.479
I've noticed. I mean, so happy.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.206
And that's made me really sad.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.999
Inexplicably, deeply sad.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.879
You know? I mean, different than my
general snarky, bitter, tortured thing.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:25.279
And... So anyway, I went to see
your show, not knowing exactly why,

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.448
and I saw your piece.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.480
And I stared.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.879
And then I had to get out
of there. I ran home.

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:39.599
And I started writing. I...

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.679
Just writing, all night.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.039
Then I wrote all night
and into today.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.319
I mean, that's why I
was late. I was writing.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.439
And you know what?

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.239
I was happy doing it.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:55.119
I was really happy for the
first time in a long time.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.919
And as soon as I felt
this happy thing, I...

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.407
I wanted to be with you.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.319
You were the first person
I wanted to be with.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.479
I mean, then it hit me, and
this was around 6:00 a.m.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.842
You know, it hit me that

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:15.159
the reason that I was so
sad when you got so happy,

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.439
and I was happier
when you got so sad,

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.449
was not because I didn't
want you to be happy.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:26.203
It was just because I wanted to be
part of the reason you were happy.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.967
I wanna make you happy.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:59.919
So, um, what I'm wondering
right about now is...

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:04.159
I mean, if you have any
reaction to what I just said.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.921
Or more specifically, do you wanna
have dinner with me tomorrow night?

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.129
Maybe?

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.679
If you'll excuse me, I
definitely need another drink.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.719
No, wait.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.079
I would have dinner
with you, but I can't.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.959
I can't have dinner.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.279
What, not the season?

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:40.519
No, um, I can't have
dinner with you

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.769
because I'm with Helen.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.559
You're gonna have
dinner with Helen?

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.759
No.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.359
I'm, um,

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.609

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:03.890
- As in with-with?
- Right. with-with.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.159
Wow.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.519
I don't know what to say.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.609
- I don't either.
- Jess?

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.959
Yeah. Hey.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.448
- Hey, they're serving the first course.
- Great. Um...

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:23.241
- Here, your jacket.
- Right. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:28.451
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, Helen.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.159
How are you?

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.806
I'm good, thanks.

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.288
That's good.

Thanks.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.279
That must be a pretty good book.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.926
It is. It's amazing actually.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.559
- That's enough reading for one night.
- Sweetie, stop it.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.969
I just want to finish this chapter.
It's really interesting.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.362
Sorry.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:48.199

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.439
What?

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.959
No. I just forgot to pick
up my dry cleaning again.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.439
I got it.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.166
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:12.959
Can't we talk about this?

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.799
No, sweetie we've talked.
We talk all the time.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.079
- I know, I know. Isn't it great?
- Of course it's great.

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.439
Our talks are great.

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.159
So good communication is the key
to a successful relationship.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.319
- We never have sex.
- What? Yes, we do. What do you mean?

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.679
- We don't.
- Yes, we do.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.928
When was the last time, sweetie?

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.039
- I gotta think about it for a...
- A month ago.

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.999
Okay, okay. But it was good, right?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.319
It was... It was good.
Wasn't it good?

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.519
- You drank a bottle of wine.
- No, I didn't. That's not true.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.719
That's not true. I had
maybe two and a half...

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.839
- Jess, what we have is a friendship.
- What do you mean?

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.559
- We're best friends.
- I know. Isn't it great?

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.239
Of course it's great.
It just isn't enough.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.799
How can you say that? I love you.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.679
I love you too.
That isn't the issue.

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.599
Well, what is the issue?
What is the issue?

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.599
- I wanna be with someone who wants me.
- I want you.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.359
- I wanna be with someone who craves me.
- Well, I crave you.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.006
Someone who wants to
rip my clothes off.

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.199
Why, why, Why?

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.879
Why can't it just be great
and loving and tender?

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.359
Why is that not enough for you?
I don't understand.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:24.039
I mean, don't you think maybe you place
a little too much emphasis on sex?

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.919
Have you ever thought that it's just one
component of a much larger package?

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.919
- Jesus Christ, I want the whole package!
- I do too.

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:34.250
- I think we have it. We live together.
- We're roommates.

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.799
How can you say that to me?

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:46.879
- Hi, it's Jessica and Helen.
- We're not home now.

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:50.079
But if you leave us a message, we
will definitely call you back.

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.199
Hello, my darlings. It's Mom.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.483
Daddy got reservations for us
at Nobu, and not at 5:30.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.679
Um, can I just stick
this on the board?

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.326
- Yeah, right. Sure.
- Is that fine?

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.079
- You're an artist?
- Oh, yeah. Trying to be.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:59.479
- Thanks.
- I actually might know somebody.

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:01.399
You know someone who
might be interested?

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.479
Yeah. Could be.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.679
Really? Well, maybe...
Should I leave you one?

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.962
- Yeah.
- Maybe I'll leave you three.

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:10.599
Okay. Well, I would
really be grateful.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:13.199
So thanks for the...

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.479
- Jessica?
- Oh, my God.

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.479
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.479
How are you?

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.959
I'm good. I'm great. How are you?

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.319
- Good, I'm good.
- Good. God, it's been a really long time.

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:30.359
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. So how's...
- So how's...

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:33.679
- I'm sorry. I... You... What...
- Oh, no. I was just gonna say...

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:35.599
I'm sorry. You go ahead.
Go ahead, speak.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.167
- How's your writing coming?
- It's good.

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:41.759
- It's, you know, glamorous.
- Yeah, right. I can see that.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.399
- How's the paper?
- Oh, um...

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.599
- I quit actually.
- Really?

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.279
- Yeah, I left a few months after you did.
- Wow.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.643
- Really? That's great.
- Yeah, it was great. It was really great.

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:55.799
- So you're painting?
- Um, yes.

01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:58.039
I mean, you know, not
for cash, but yeah.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.519
- Right, well, who needs cash?
- Who needs cash? I do.

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.119
- Right. Right. Yeah.
- So...

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.402
- How's Helen?
- Oh, um...

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.970
She's good. She's great.

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:12.359
- We're not together anymore.
- I'm sorry.

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.559
- Thanks, yeah.
- What happened?

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.679
Um...

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.689
She dumped me.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.399
- Wow.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.399
- That's bad. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, it was bad. Thank you.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.719
That's okay. What are you gonna do?

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.999
She wanted to be with
somebody a little more...

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.639
A little more?

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:36.244
A little more gay,
I guess, was the thing.

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:39.399
- Right. Wow.
- So what are you gonna do, right?

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.602
Yeah. What are you gonna do?

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.599
So... But we're friends now.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.199
- Well, that's good. That's very good.
- So it's good.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.199
- Yeah, it's very good.
- Yeah. Friends are good.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.243
Friends are good.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.279
Sweetie.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:00.079
Will you please turn that off?

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.159
No, you turn it off.

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.679
You set it. You gotta get up.

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:07.279
I do have to get up.

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:09.439
But I turned it last time.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.399
- You do it.
- All right. I'll make the coffee.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.439
- All right. I'll turn it off.
- Oh, my God.

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:16.484
You slept on my arm
the entire night.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.479
Oh, wait. I feel really tired.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.879
- It's really good to see you too.
- It's good to see you too.

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.959
- It's nice to run into you.
- The same. The same.

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.128
- Okay. Take care.
- Okay.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.639
- I wanted to get your...
- You know, I'd love to...

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.919
- I don't have your new number.
- New number, yeah.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.599
You know what?
It's all on this flier.

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:42.919
My new number and actually,
my E-mail is best these days.

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:45.399
- E-mail?
- Yeah.

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.319
- I succumbed. E-mail is best.
- You succumbed. Yeah.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.999
Wow, E-mail. Okay. Thanks.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.199
- Okay, I'll see you later. Yeah, you too.
- Take care of yourself.

She's not here yet.

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:10.999
She ran into Josh Meyers.
Just now, that's why she's late.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.999
I know, I know.
I'll get the whole story.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.999
- Hey, sweetie.
- Oh, my God.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.319
- Hi. Jessica just got here. I gotta go.
- Hi.

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.239
Okay. Yeah, I will. Bye.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:22.719
- Laurie sends her love.
- Thank you.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.639
So, what did he say?

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:28.599
Um... Well, first of all,
I got really nervous.

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.759
- Oh, my God. That's such a surprise.
- I know, I know.

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.479
<i>That you and I could never be</i>
