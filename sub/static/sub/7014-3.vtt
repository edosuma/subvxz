Eric Forman's Basement

00:04.267 --> 00:05.594
Midnight

00:05.911 --> 00:07.354
Eric's 18th Birthday

00:07.689 --> 00:10.575
And... midnight.

00:11.117 --> 00:13.828
So long 17, in the words of Alice Cooper

00:14.248 --> 00:15.737
I'm 18 and I like it.

00:17.480 --> 00:18.584
Happy birthday, Man.

00:18.584 --> 00:19.795
Let's give him his present.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.649
It's a case of 23 beers.

00:28.431 --> 00:31.085
- Kelso?
- I deserved one, I carried it.

00:35.324 --> 00:36.191
Yeah...

00:37.521 --> 00:38.906
that tastes like 18.

00:41.436 --> 00:44.148
Whoa, check out the new stereo.

00:45.105 --> 00:48.566
Oh it plays records and 8 tracks, this thing's like right out of the future.

00:50.534 --> 00:52.322
Yeah Donna gave it to me.

00:52.457 --> 00:55.226
I think she feels bad that she's going to college
without me.

00:55.318 --> 00:58.155
So on the one hand I'm losing the girl that
I've been in love with since I was 5

00:58.155 --> 01:00.981
but on the other hand I get a crappy stereo.

01:01.949 --> 01:02.977
Score!

01:04.432 --> 01:08.586
What? I mean she's going to dump you eventually.
Rock and roll never dies.

01:14.337 --> 01:16.893
Kelso, Donna and I are fine, okay?

01:17.442 --> 01:20.149
I mean, she's waiting until the very last bus to go to school tomorrow,

01:20.149 --> 01:24.092
so we can spend every minute of my birthday together.
We're just gonna make this work.

01:24.092 --> 01:28.361
Eric, long distance relationships don't work.
Just ask my girlfriend back home.

01:28.361 --> 01:29.648
Fez, you have a girlfriend back home?

01:29.648 --> 01:32.349
No, don't you listen?
Long distance relationships don't work.

01:35.294 --> 01:39.218
You guys, Donna and I are not gonna let a couple of miles
come between us, okay?

01:39.359 --> 01:40.746
This isn't the end of the world.

01:44.673 --> 01:46.404
My world is over, man.

01:48.238 --> 01:53.473
Forman, I know what you're thinking. Donna's gonna go to school,
meet a whole bunch of people way cooler than you

01:53.473 --> 01:55.262
and probably fall in love with someone else.

01:57.419 --> 02:00.188
-And you don't think she will?
- Oh, I know she will.

02:03.012 --> 02:04.743
My advice to you is drink up.

02:06.661 --> 02:11.849
I can't believe she's just leaving, y'know?
Hasn't she heard of a little something called sacrifice?

02:13.363 --> 02:17.825
Y'know, she sacrifices an education, or a career,
or a future of any kind, and in exchange

02:19.444 --> 02:20.550
she gets me.

02:22.846 --> 02:24.981
You don't offer much in the way of excitement,

02:25.635 --> 02:31.117
but if it's the same old same old a girls after, look out.

02:34.513 --> 02:36.084
I never deserved her anyway

02:36.084 --> 02:39.326
Well we're here for ya.
Here ya go, dry your eyes.

02:41.422 --> 02:44.884
Thanks you guys, I feel better.

02:51.396 --> 02:53.415
I think we all do.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.407
Alright buddy, come on let's get you to bed.

02:57.269 --> 02:59.116
Big boy lets tuck you in.

03:07.298 --> 03:08.170
Alright, sleep tight buddy.

04:10.697 --> 04:12.852
Okay Red, remember

04:14.217 --> 04:19.523
don't tire yourself out today,
because tonight is a special night in the bedroom.

04:22.253 --> 04:24.158
Bob Newhart's on Carson?

04:25.812 --> 04:28.812
No silly, it's been a month since your heart attack.

04:29.130 --> 04:31.379
Tonight's the night the doctor gave us the okay.

04:34.019 --> 04:36.616
Y'know the okay.

04:39.137 --> 04:41.444
Kitty I don't like clues, just say it.

04:42.895 --> 04:45.697
- The okay to make love.
- Don't say that.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.494
Well tonight is my only night off this week.

04:49.494 --> 04:52.033
Let's not talk about it in front of the boy.

04:53.238 --> 04:55.200
Or girl, or whatever he is today.

04:56.965 --> 04:58.810
Let's not talk about what in front of the boy?

05:03.226 --> 05:05.823
Ohhh, you guys are planning a surprise party for me tonight, aren't you?

05:06.467 --> 05:08.485
Well first of all, thank you.

05:08.923 --> 05:13.655
Second of all let me just say, 18 years old,
not too old for ice-cream cake, okay.

05:15.341 --> 05:18.168
So where's my special birthday breakfast?

05:18.396 --> 05:22.259
Oh my goodness, I've been so busy this morning
I forgot all about your breakfast.

05:22.892 --> 05:26.673
Okay I'll play along.

05:30.145 --> 05:37.701
La de da, here I am, completely unaware that I'm about to get
my super birthday breakfast with 4 pieces of bacon.

05:39.637 --> 05:43.559
- Honey, there is no breakfast.
- Mom gags over, gimmie the bacon.

05:45.005 --> 05:46.678
Are you sure you want bacon?

05:47.112 --> 05:47.691
It's fattening.

05:48.786 --> 05:50.920
You barely fit into your best dress as it is.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.388
Eric honey, let me make it up to you.

05:58.532 --> 06:02.570
How about tonight instead of hanging out
around here you just...

06:03.423 --> 06:04.865
you take the night off.

06:07.439 --> 06:10.429
Oh, because there's 'no party'. I'm with ya.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.701
I'm with you.

06:20.782 --> 06:23.378
Steven I am so glad we're back together.

06:23.588 --> 06:26.300
I thought I'd lost my little Puddin' Pop forever.

06:27.091 --> 06:31.358
Wanna hear something sick?
I actually missed you calling me Puddin' Pop.

06:35.752 --> 06:38.232
How many times have I told you guys not to make out on my bed?

06:39.832 --> 06:42.831
You guys are like cats, you don't even listen.
Down!

06:45.128 --> 06:48.762
Donna! Donna you know what?
You're leaving tonight so technically this isn't your bed anymore.

06:48.899 --> 06:52.245
Besides, I just can't keep my hands off my Puddin' Pop.

06:54.263 --> 06:55.293
- Puddin' Pop?
- Puddin' Pop?

06:57.218 --> 06:58.488
Is that supposed to be me?

06:59.325 --> 07:01.229
I've never heard that name before in my life.

07:06.644 --> 07:07.104
Donna,

07:08.388 --> 07:09.253
you're amazing.

07:09.718 --> 07:13.294
Taking the midnight bus tonight, just so you can
spend my whole birthday with me that...

07:13.782 --> 07:16.436
I swear that is right up there with not wearing a bra in public.

07:17.574 --> 07:18.385
Wow

07:18.969 --> 07:20.410
you're taking this really well.

07:20.557 --> 07:24.135
Yeah well, I know I have a history of ruining these things.

07:24.626 --> 07:29.240
Birthdays, holidays, that perm that made you look like a poodle.

07:30.795 --> 07:32.700
But I'm not gonna do that okay?

07:33.114 --> 07:35.133
I'm not gonna ruin our last day together.

07:37.406 --> 07:38.789
Oh, so

07:39.075 --> 07:40.345
you're taking the toaster?

07:41.510 --> 07:42.021
What?

07:42.711 --> 07:47.787
Ah, it's just y'know we bought it together,
so I guess I kinda though it was like our toaster.

07:49.276 --> 07:52.047
What do I know, it's not like I'm the one going to college right?

07:52.244 --> 07:54.264
You are - with my toaster.

07:55.304 --> 07:59.747
- Okay Eric if it's a problem...
- Oh, it's a problem.
You thought you could just sneak it out of town without telling me

07:59.832 --> 08:01.622
cause you knew it was wrong, didn't ya lady?

08:03.477 --> 08:07.400
Okay Eric, I don't know what your deal is,
but you're ruining our last day together.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.910
I wouldn't be me if I didn't ruin it!

08:12.013 --> 08:15.760
You know what?
Enjoy your toast, I hope it burns!

08:23.758 --> 08:29.327
Oh man, Casablanca. This is the part where
Humphrey Bogart tells Ingrid Bergman

08:29.492 --> 08:31.455
they'll always have Paris.

08:31.806 --> 08:34.054
What's his problem?
The guy owns a bar, man.

08:35.284 --> 08:38.053
he'd be beating those French sluts off with a stick.

08:40.097 --> 08:41.251
How'd it go with Donna?

08:41.967 --> 08:43.238
I ruined it.

08:44.499 --> 08:47.555
And I knew I was ruining it, while I was ruining it.

08:48.647 --> 08:50.436
I just kept on ruining it.

08:51.785 --> 08:52.939
Now Bogey y'know...

08:54.254 --> 08:55.986
that guy knows how to let a woman go.

08:56.398 --> 08:58.076
"Here's lookin' at you Kid."

08:59.129 --> 09:00.340
I threw a toaster.

09:03.105 --> 09:06.164
Hey if you wanna be like Bogey you gotta let her go.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.015
Only Bogey'll get another hot girl.

09:11.059 --> 09:14.057
You, I see Star Wars conventions and fat chicks.

09:15.298 --> 09:18.988
Hey, Bogey and I have more in common than you think.

09:23.616 --> 09:27.596
Of all the teenage burger hangouts,
in all the towns, in all the world,

09:28.117 --> 09:32.385
she walks into mine, only to walk right back out again.

09:41.696 --> 09:42.678
Play it Fez.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.457
It'll cost you a Baby Ruth.

10:23.321 --> 10:24.984
Now I want a Baby Ruth.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.860
Hey, let's go to the Hub.

10:28.913 --> 10:31.105
- Uh, I can't.
- Let me see that.

10:32.754 --> 10:37.772
Forman, I think there's a rule that when you turn 18 you can't
let Scooby tell you the time anymore.

10:39.987 --> 10:43.852
Shows what you know Hyde, that's Deputy Dawg.

10:48.539 --> 10:51.745
I can't wait until all of Donna's giant clothes are out of the closet.

10:51.745 --> 10:58.090
I don't even go in there now. I'm afraid I'll fall into one of her big shoes,
and never be heard from again.

10:58.994 --> 11:04.613
Well I guess I must be Eric's best friend, 'cause I'm the only one
took the trouble of getting him a birthday cake.

11:06.996 --> 11:07.976
It's good too.

11:09.536 --> 11:13.689
Maybe we should think about getting him something else.
What do you think, Puddin Pop?

11:16.792 --> 11:23.054
Why does everybody keep calling me that? My name's not
Puddin' Pop, I've never heard that name before in my life.

11:24.340 --> 11:25.900
Forman's dead.

11:26.944 --> 11:30.577
Hey if you guys think that's funny, you should hear what Steven calls me.
He calls me his...

11:33.164 --> 11:35.761
Hey!
Oh hey, that's some good cake.

11:38.041 --> 11:39.830
So I heard Eric threw a toaster.

11:41.704 --> 11:44.415
It's almost as bad as the time he called you a poodle head.

11:45.181 --> 11:47.204
Which he brought up again today.

11:47.204 --> 11:48.473
He's not good.

11:49.721 --> 11:52.720
Well I'm just surprised Eric was able to lift the toaster.

11:56.039 --> 12:03.479
Donna I've been looking all over for you. I'm so sorry
I was such a jerk earlier. It's your last day, and it's my birthday

12:04.902 --> 12:08.709
- I just... I wanna spend it together.
- Eric it's okay, I know you don't care about the toaster.

12:09.419 --> 12:12.245
You're sad I'm leaving and I'm sad too.

12:13.095 --> 12:15.807
Hey don't take him back, he threw a toaster.

12:20.089 --> 12:23.931
Hey, shouldn't my surprise party have started already?

12:23.931 --> 12:27.390
We keep telling you there's no party man, it's like you're deaf.

12:28.268 --> 12:32.076
Eric there is NO party.

12:39.696 --> 12:43.733
No, no, no, why are you here?
You can't be here.

12:45.180 --> 12:50.142
Oh right, I'll go outside, then I'll come back,
and you guys yell 'surprise!' and I'll yell 'you got me!'

12:50.293 --> 12:53.119
Eric honey, there's no party.

12:53.677 --> 12:54.603
What?

12:56.313 --> 13:02.402
How can there not be a party? Mom, what is
more important than your only son's 18th birthday?

13:12.713 --> 13:13.924
Okay fine.

13:15.358 --> 13:19.626
For the first time since his heart attack
your father and I are having intercourse.

13:26.537 --> 13:27.576
Sexy

13:31.458 --> 13:33.883
Okay let's get this over with.

13:37.757 --> 13:39.315
Happy birthday.

13:47.288 --> 13:52.535
I can't friggin' believe my Mom didn't plan a friggin' party
on my 18th friggin' birthday.

13:54.158 --> 13:58.170
The only party going on in this house is in their bedroom,
and that's all ugh!

14:00.346 --> 14:04.039
Forman, you hate it when your Mom does stuff for your birthday.
Remember 2 years ago?

14:10.437 --> 14:12.465
I'm 16.

14:14.059 --> 14:19.253
Hey, your mother worked very hard on this party,
now you be nice to her or we're cancelling the puppet show.

14:21.126 --> 14:24.357
Oh sit on the tiny horse, so I can take a picture.

14:26.536 --> 14:27.633
I can't Mom

14:28.178 --> 14:29.159
I'll kill it

14:33.286 --> 14:34.670
Yeah okay, fine

14:35.618 --> 14:37.234
but she should have done something for me.

14:37.367 --> 14:38.863
Well we're here for ya.

14:38.863 --> 14:42.672
We scraped together a few bucks
and got you something you can actually use.

14:44.164 --> 14:44.857
What is it?

14:45.053 --> 14:47.130
It's a knob for your new stereo.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.580
Wait, did you guys just take this off while I wasn't looking?

14:54.087 --> 14:58.643
Eric, there's an old saying.
'Don't look a gift horse in the knob'.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.482
And what happened to my Led Zeppelin 8 track?

15:06.482 --> 15:08.155
You mean gift number 2.

15:16.953 --> 15:18.971
Well hello handsome.

15:21.030 --> 15:22.763
Boy am I tired.

15:24.134 --> 15:25.845
I think I'll just go to bed.

15:25.845 --> 15:28.093
Red Forman what has gotten into you?

15:28.270 --> 15:32.367
I just think that there are more appropriate ways for us to spend our time.

15:32.896 --> 15:35.028
Like you knit and I'll whittle.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.731
That's a nice life.

15:38.519 --> 15:40.307
Red, I know what this is about.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.948
You're afraid of getting physical so soon after your heart attack.

15:45.461 --> 15:52.038
Kitty, you know I love what we do.
Am I willing to die for it?

15:55.234 --> 16:00.194
Now you just relax, nurse Kitty is here to take care of you.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.566
Well, big paw's on the 11

16:15.209 --> 16:17.230
so it's almost time to take Donna to the bus station.

16:18.248 --> 16:21.306
This is it you guys, she's really going away.

16:21.626 --> 16:24.165
Forman, we have just the thing to make you feel better.
Psst.

16:28.715 --> 16:30.677
Another case of beer!

16:33.125 --> 16:35.953
Oh, I'm just not really in the mood to put on a dress.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.264
But thanks anyway Puddin' Pop.

16:43.634 --> 16:46.404
Aw! Look man, if you want her to stay,
can't you just ask her to stay?

16:46.717 --> 16:50.120
You have no idea how badly I wanna do that but I just,

16:52.976 --> 16:55.910
- I don't think it'd be fair to her.
- Fair to her?

16:57.955 --> 17:00.551
Who cares what the woman thinks?
This is America.

17:02.865 --> 17:08.342
Y'know what? I already screwed this up once today,
I am not gonna screw this up again.

17:08.674 --> 17:12.597
I'm gonna fight every bad instinct I have, and I'm just gonna let her go.

17:13.383 --> 17:15.806
Like Bogey did in Casablanca.

17:16.008 --> 17:19.123
Wait so that's it?
Nobody's gonna drink beer and put on a dress?

17:22.147 --> 17:23.766
Hey Fez, you wanna beer?

17:25.250 --> 17:26.001
Sure

17:30.172 --> 17:34.613
Jackie! What did you do to my room?

17:35.191 --> 17:38.192
Your room? Uh, read the wall Donna.

17:39.129 --> 17:44.089
Jackie, this is still my room until I leave, so will you get out
and give me and Eric a few minutes alone?

17:44.305 --> 17:46.902
But I still have to paint the heart over the 'I'

17:47.565 --> 17:50.564
- Out, shoo.
- Oh God, alright Donna!

17:52.826 --> 17:54.904
Okay you're all packed.

17:55.693 --> 17:57.599
I can't believe my baby's leaving.

17:58.698 --> 18:00.356
Well hey, I'll still be around, sir.

18:00.356 --> 18:03.935
Why would I wanna pal around with you?
All you did was dirty her up.

18:21.854 --> 18:23.181
You should probably get going.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.148
Happy birthday, Eric.

18:33.888 --> 18:34.583
Donna

18:36.676 --> 18:39.659
this is the nicest thing anyone's done for me all day.

18:40.694 --> 18:41.677
Make a wish.

18:48.659 --> 18:51.129
Oh boy, do I smell cupcakes?

19:01.941 --> 19:02.808
So...

19:05.452 --> 19:06.894
I'm really gonna miss you.

19:07.419 --> 19:08.574
Yeah me too.

19:10.064 --> 19:13.236
Donna I'm really happy for you.

19:21.109 --> 19:23.934
Well, bye I guess.

19:30.135 --> 19:31.808
Donna wait!

19:36.163 --> 19:40.142
- Donna you have to stay.
- Stay? You're supposed to tell me to go.

19:40.453 --> 19:45.068
No if you leave you'll regret it. Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but in a couple of weeks or...

19:46.111 --> 19:48.072
at least by Christmas.

19:48.903 --> 19:50.634
Oh my God, you're such a loser.

19:51.298 --> 19:54.353
- Donna
- Here's looking at you, dork.

19:59.476 --> 20:00.688
What did you wanna tell me?

20:02.120 --> 20:03.388
Have a safe trip.

20:06.359 --> 20:06.995
Thanks

20:22.896 --> 20:24.338
Donna, what?

20:24.929 --> 20:26.027
I couldn't do it.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.180
I couldn't do it.

20:28.767 --> 20:33.093
This whole time I was thinking I was supposed to leave,
and then when the time came to get on the bus, I couldn't do it.

20:33.842 --> 20:37.364
I'll figure college out later, all I know is I wanna stay here with you.

20:39.409 --> 20:40.851
Oh my God, Donna.

20:42.143 --> 20:43.643
that's what I wished for.

21:01.254 --> 21:03.619
Donna we didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

21:04.703 --> 21:06.724
Did you guys get him drunk and make him wear a dress?

21:07.420 --> 21:10.131
Yes, but I've been wanting to do this for sometime.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.851
To tired?

21:23.871 --> 21:25.486
Yeah that was pretty silly.

21:27.006 --> 21:28.621
Knit and Whittle?

21:30.982 --> 21:32.828
Yeah I hate to whittle.

21:38.754 --> 21:40.543
Where's the aspirin?

21:42.530 --> 21:45.415
Oh like you've never woken up in a dress before?
