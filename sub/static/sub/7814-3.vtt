13:35.834 --> 13:37.667
Sounds like we
have a deal.

13:37.667 --> 13:40.542
But if you do so much
as one little stunt,

13:40.542 --> 13:42.041
you’re going to be signed up

13:42.041 --> 13:44.583
for a full year of discipline,

13:44.583 --> 13:45.792
regimentation,

13:45.792 --> 13:47.125
and crew cuts!

13:47.125 --> 13:49.083
Deal.
If anybody needs me,

13:49.083 --> 13:50.458
I’ll be in my room--

13:50.458 --> 13:52.625
in control,
not doing stunts.

13:57.583 --> 13:58.583
[clears throat]

13:58.583 --> 13:59.792
Starting now.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.583
Okay. 24 hours begins...

14:03.583 --> 14:05.583
now.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.208
[bell tolls]

14:07.208 --> 14:10.166
Eight minutes, and you’re
doing so awesome, Kick.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.250
Kick?

14:11.250 --> 14:12.375
[moaning]

14:21.125 --> 14:24.125
Maybe I can’t do this, Gunther.
Maybe it’s too much temptation.

14:24.125 --> 14:25.542
Maybe?

14:25.542 --> 14:27.375
Get rid of it, Gunther,
all of it.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.375
Now!

14:32.542 --> 14:36.667
Once you fail, I’m going turn
your room into Muscle Beach.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.917
It’s gonna be perfect.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.792
[yawns]

14:42.792 --> 14:45.500
So strong.
So handsome.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.750
So Brad.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.792
Must be the Spandex.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.041
[kissing sounds]

14:52.041 --> 14:54.166
No way.
Kick will never crack.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.000
He’s too strong.
He’s too focused.

14:56.000 --> 14:56.667
[rummaging]
He’s--

15:00.000 --> 15:02.375
[gasps]
No! Bad Kick!

15:02.375 --> 15:03.917
No!

15:03.917 --> 15:04.834
[growling]

15:07.625 --> 15:08.875
[snarls]

15:08.875 --> 15:10.625
Hand it over.

15:10.625 --> 15:13.500
[groans]

15:13.500 --> 15:14.750
All of it.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.417
[whistles]

15:18.125 --> 15:20.375
[bell tolls]

15:20.375 --> 15:23.834
Well, this
ought to keep you
out of trouble.

15:23.834 --> 15:27.166
Nothing’s getting in.
Nothing’s getting out.

15:27.166 --> 15:28.959
Now we just wait it out,

15:28.959 --> 15:31.166
and I can still enjoy the view.

15:31.166 --> 15:34.083
Maybe we ought to keep you
away from the edge.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.500
What’s the matter?
Still think I’m out of control?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.458
No way, Kick. I was
just thinking why tempt--

15:38.458 --> 15:39.792
[ropes groan]
Kick!

15:39.792 --> 15:40.959
Stop! Don’t do it!

15:40.959 --> 15:42.583
[giggles]

15:46.542 --> 15:47.792
The adrenaline feels so good!

15:49.375 --> 15:50.709
You’re all mine now, Buttowski.

15:50.709 --> 15:52.250
Hope you like crew cuts.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.166
No!

15:55.166 --> 15:57.834
Quick. Get me out of here.

15:57.834 --> 15:58.834
Perfect.

16:01.709 --> 16:03.750
[bells tolls]

16:03.750 --> 16:07.041
[Gunther]
My parents use this to get me
to stop smelling my fingers.

16:07.041 --> 16:09.625
It’s not my fault
they smell delicious.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.500
[sniffs]

16:11.500 --> 16:13.208
[groans]

16:13.208 --> 16:14.333
Test it.

16:17.208 --> 16:18.917
[electricity snaps]

16:18.917 --> 16:20.375
Good work, Gunther.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.583
With this thing,
I’ll definitely be able

16:21.583 --> 16:22.709
to stay away from stunts.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.041
[Brad]
You surprise me, dillweed.

16:24.041 --> 16:25.834
I thought you would
have cracked by now.

16:25.834 --> 16:27.750
Cracking is for the weak.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.333
Or maybe you just haven’t
been tempted enough.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.417
Reeh!

16:31.417 --> 16:33.000
Is that a--

16:33.000 --> 16:35.458
A nitro-burning
"hyper-septubulous" skate?

16:35.458 --> 16:36.458
Yes.

16:36.458 --> 16:37.917
Yes, it is.

16:37.917 --> 16:41.166
Not going to work, Brad.
I’m still in control.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.917
That’s too bad, because
the Department of Public Works

16:43.917 --> 16:46.667
has left this perfectly good
sinkhole unattended.

16:46.667 --> 16:50.041
Can’t hold out much longer.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.333
Kick, you got to resist,

16:51.333 --> 16:53.291
or they’re going to send you
to reform school

16:53.291 --> 16:55.125
and we’ll never get
to hang out again.

16:55.125 --> 16:58.166
You can’t resist.
Feel the adrenaline.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.291
Sweet, sweet adrenaline.

17:00.291 --> 17:01.375
No adrenaline, Kick!

17:01.375 --> 17:02.417
No!

17:02.417 --> 17:04.166
You know you want to.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.000
Must resist.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.208
[struggles]

17:10.375 --> 17:11.750
Rats.

17:11.750 --> 17:14.375
You’re gonna have to do
better than that.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.041
[sizzles]

17:16.041 --> 17:17.375
Come on.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.083
The kid’s getting close.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.000
Look at the time.
He’s almost halfway there.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.166
You promised us.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.291
You said you would
handle this, Brad.

17:24.291 --> 17:25.291
Don’t worry.

17:25.291 --> 17:27.291
I got one more trick
up my sleeve.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.458
[panting]
Finally.

17:30.458 --> 17:34.083
No Brad, no stunts,
no nothing. We’re safe.

17:34.083 --> 17:35.417
Kick,

17:35.417 --> 17:37.333
why are you looking
at me like that.

17:37.333 --> 17:38.542
Like what, Blue?

17:38.542 --> 17:39.542
What did you call me?

17:42.208 --> 17:43.750
Blue.

17:45.458 --> 17:47.709
I think it’s time
to get some help.

17:51.750 --> 17:54.583
Must not do stunts.

17:54.583 --> 17:57.917
Need help coming down.

17:57.917 --> 18:00.083
Worry not because I’m gonna
teach you...

18:02.125 --> 18:03.667
Lesson 1--

18:03.667 --> 18:06.375
let nature be your ride.

18:06.375 --> 18:09.333
Partake.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.709
[both sniff]

18:12.250 --> 18:13.875
Ah.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.542
Lesson number 2--

18:15.542 --> 18:18.583
when some tries
to harsh your mellow,

18:18.583 --> 18:22.000
you just let it go
and roll like the dog.

18:24.792 --> 18:28.000
And now our final lesson,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.959
and I can’t stress this enough.

18:30.959 --> 18:34.417
You got to know
when it’s time to kick back.

18:42.542 --> 18:44.709
[bell tolls]

18:44.709 --> 18:45.875
[bike bell rings]

18:52.709 --> 18:54.208
Well!

18:54.208 --> 18:55.750
If it isn’t Mr. Buttowski.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.458
I just happen to have

18:58.458 --> 19:00.667
these shiny new skates.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.291
Want to give them a try?

19:02.291 --> 19:04.333
Maybe later, chickadee.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.542
But right now
I’m just gonna let it go.

19:06.542 --> 19:08.291
and roll like the dog.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.417
[growls, whines]

19:12.417 --> 19:13.667
[tires screech]
Hey, Kick.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.208
You want to drag?

19:17.208 --> 19:18.792
Go on. You know you want to.

19:18.792 --> 19:19.792
[revs engine]

19:19.792 --> 19:22.291
Thanks all the same.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.333
[sniffs]

19:23.333 --> 19:24.792
Nature’s my ride.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.750
Hey, dillweed.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.333
You think you’ve got this
in the bag?

19:31.333 --> 19:33.792
You failed, Brad, as usual.

19:33.792 --> 19:36.166
I still have three minutes.

19:36.166 --> 19:38.542
What could you possibly
do in three minutes?

19:38.542 --> 19:39.875
[engine revs]

19:39.875 --> 19:41.250
Hey, Brad, where did you get

19:41.250 --> 19:43.792
this awesome
armored personnel carrier?

19:43.792 --> 19:46.917
Now where did I park my awesome
armored personnel carrier?

19:48.500 --> 19:49.500
[ticking]

19:49.500 --> 19:51.834
Must not weaken.

19:51.834 --> 19:53.083
Go on, Kick.

19:53.083 --> 19:54.125
Why don’t you
take a closer look?

19:55.750 --> 19:57.917
Can’t you just feel the power?

19:57.917 --> 19:59.667
I jammed
the accelerator open,

19:59.667 --> 20:02.834
so all you have to do
is just release
the parking brake.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.083
[laughs]

20:06.542 --> 20:08.375
Ha ha ha ha ha!

20:08.375 --> 20:10.208
Don’t do it, Kick.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.750
It’s not worth it!

20:11.750 --> 20:14.417
This is a pretty sweet truck.
It might be worth it.

20:14.417 --> 20:16.917
I’ve had just about
enough from you, Gunther.

20:16.917 --> 20:18.417
I’m not gonna let you
stand in the way

20:18.417 --> 20:20.458
of my ultimate
muscle beach hangout.

20:20.458 --> 20:23.208
I’m not about to let you
break up an awesome friendship!

20:23.208 --> 20:24.375
[engine revs]

20:24.375 --> 20:25.709
[tires screech]

20:25.709 --> 20:26.875
Yes.
No!

20:28.709 --> 20:30.834
Well, I better get
my biceps oiled up

20:30.834 --> 20:32.625
and invite the ladies over.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.417
Oh, Kick, no!

20:34.417 --> 20:37.208
[sobs]

20:37.208 --> 20:38.667
Why so glum, chum?

20:38.667 --> 20:39.709
Kick!

20:39.709 --> 20:42.166
[bell tolls]

20:42.166 --> 20:45.125
You did it, Kick.
How did you resist?

20:45.125 --> 20:48.750
Sometimes you got to know
when it’s time to kick back.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.375
That’s awesome.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.625
We are so proud.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.875
No reform school for you, son.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.417
No way.
He totally cheated.

20:55.417 --> 20:56.875
It took a lot of work

20:56.875 --> 20:59.208
to grab that truck
and soup it up and--

20:59.208 --> 21:01.125
Are you the one
who stole my vehicle?

21:01.125 --> 21:03.417
Uh, no, sir.
I just borrowed it
for a little bit.

21:03.417 --> 21:05.583
Better come with me, son.
You’re out of control.

21:05.583 --> 21:06.917
Bye, Brad.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.375
Hope you like crew cuts.

21:09.375 --> 21:12.291
Well, I’ve got some
unfinished business
to take care of.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.208
[cat yowls]

21:24.792 --> 21:27.458
[sniffs]
Ah, oh, yeah.

21:27.458 --> 21:29.375
[sniffs]

21:29.375 --> 21:31.166
Mmm.
