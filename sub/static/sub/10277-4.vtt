00:05.113 --> 00:06.432
Previously on E.R...

00:06.433 --> 00:08.952
Under no circumstances is that man
to go into that operating room.

00:09.153 --> 00:11.829
Call security if you have to,
and enjoy your first solo surgery.

00:11.830 --> 00:16.140
I don't need you to feel sorry
or tender or anything.

00:16.542 --> 00:18.127
I just need you to go away.

00:18.128 --> 00:19.587
Paula Trancoso, Chicago Gazette.

00:19.622 --> 00:21.864
Elizabeth Corday, my associate
Head of Surgery.

00:27.324 --> 00:29.323
I want you to meet Gabe Lawrence,
our new Attending.

00:29.324 --> 00:30.766
Gabe, this is Dr. Mark Green.

00:30.767 --> 00:33.836
Gabe is coming over from New Werstern
as our new attending.

00:33.937 --> 00:35.612
As our new attending?

00:36.077 --> 00:37.297
6x04 "SINS OF THE FATHERS"

00:37.388 --> 00:42.433
I said the lap-chole at 11,
the gastric bypass at 3.

00:44.542 --> 00:46.415
Have you seen my earring?

00:46.626 --> 00:50.956
Why don't you try to get hold
of him and then call me back?

00:51.174 --> 00:52.253
Already dressed?

00:52.425 --> 00:55.794
My schedule's all jumbled up.
I need to get in.

00:56.096 --> 00:59.713
Besides, Romano's got me
buried in paperwork.

01:01.058 --> 01:02.850
Oh, there they are.

01:04.269 --> 01:06.097
Oh, come on.

01:08.650 --> 01:12.694
You're going to cover me
in shaving cream.

01:13.362 --> 01:15.106
Hi. Did you get him?

01:16.448 --> 01:18.110
Yes, hello.

01:18.326 --> 01:19.655
Yes.

01:19.869 --> 01:21.992
He's right here, actually.

01:22.205 --> 01:24.411
It's your father. I'm sorry.

01:24.624 --> 01:26.082
Hi, Dad.

01:27.335 --> 01:28.829
Calm down. What?

01:29.128 --> 01:32.000
What happened?
Was anyone hurt?

01:32.215 --> 01:35.133
- Is everything all right?
- That's good.

01:37.304 --> 01:39.131
So this was last night?

01:41.766 --> 01:44.341
- You need me to stay?
- Catch you later.

01:46.313 --> 01:48.105
So, Dad? Okay, all right.

01:48.315 --> 01:51.020
Look, it's just a fender.

01:51.234 --> 01:53.725
Okay, a fender and a cypress tree.

01:54.238 --> 01:55.316
You know what?

01:55.488 --> 01:58.775
Just corn flakes and a small
orange juice, please.

01:58.951 --> 01:59.982
That's it?

02:00.203 --> 02:03.653
- No room left for food.
- I'm eating like a horse.

02:03.830 --> 02:06.068
Well, twins. They are squishing my stomach.

02:06.141 --> 02:08.000
I just got one. Is squishing more than that.

02:08.210 --> 02:12.338
- Meg, I can't read this. What's it say?
- Two over medium.

02:12.548 --> 02:14.421
Large coffee to go, please.

02:14.633 --> 02:17.171
- Morning, Carol.
- Hi.

02:18.678 --> 02:19.794
What?

02:20.347 --> 02:22.921
You have shaving cream on your ear.

02:23.976 --> 02:25.175
Thank you.

02:25.603 --> 02:26.848
How is Mark?

02:27.063 --> 02:28.722
Clean-shaven.

02:29.148 --> 02:31.982
- That's twice in one morning.
- I'm sorry.

02:32.193 --> 02:35.194
Clean it up. And get this guy
another order.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.856
- How do you manage without coffee?
- It's not so bad.

02:39.033 --> 02:42.532
It's growing out of my maternity wear
that worries me.

02:43.037 --> 02:47.366
Not to worry. You'll drop a couple
of pounds breast-feeding.

02:47.541 --> 02:48.871
See you later.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.541
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.671
- Not easy, is it?
- No.

02:54.882 --> 02:56.959
- Know what you're having?
- No.

02:57.176 --> 03:00.130
- Nothing on the ultrasound?
- Haven't had one.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.965
You should. It's important
for the baby. Who's your OB?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.509
- I've got an order.
- You do have an OB?

03:07.103 --> 03:09.345
My boss is gonna yell at me.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.019
Can I borrow your pencil and pad?

03:12.234 --> 03:15.401
I'm a nurse at County.
I'm gonna write down my name.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.528
You should come by after your shift.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.022
We'll examine you and check out the baby.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.862
I don't know. I don't have insurance.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.366
It's OK. Where I work, you don't need it.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.087
- Morning.
- Hey, the celebrity herself!

03:32.296 --> 03:33.410
Beg your pardon?

03:33.588 --> 03:37.040
- Dr. Corday, right?
- What are you talking about?

03:37.258 --> 03:42.135
"Prescription for Danger: Are You Safe
at County General?" Good picture.

03:44.809 --> 03:45.839
Oh, my God!

03:47.000 --> 03:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:36.653 --> 04:39.607
Stop it! Get that thing away from me!

04:39.822 --> 04:41.862
Leave me alone! Let go!

04:42.074 --> 04:44.565
- Robin, calm down.
- It's not so bad.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.779
- I hate you!
- Yosh?

04:47.664 --> 04:50.748
- Do you like koala bears, Robin?
- Why?

04:50.959 --> 04:54.458
I have a bear that wants
to meet you, Mr. Koala Bear.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.624
- I hate bears!
- Robin, stop it.

04:58.175 --> 05:00.167
Can you hold her, Mrs. Bourke?

05:00.344 --> 05:02.585
If you're good,
I'll take you to the toy store.

05:02.805 --> 05:05.971
- When did she start vomiting?
- This morning, after she drank her juice.

05:06.182 --> 05:07.427
Mommy, make him stop!

05:07.642 --> 05:09.515
We had takeout last night.

05:09.685 --> 05:10.801
I hate you!

05:11.647 --> 05:14.102
- Any diarrhea?
- A little.

05:14.316 --> 05:16.723
- Childhood illnesses?
- Just a few colds.

05:16.944 --> 05:18.944
Prescription medicines,
you keep those out of reach?

05:19.031 --> 05:21.130
Yes, our home is childproof.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.227
Probably food poisoning.
I'll give her...

05:24.257 --> 05:27.028
...Compazine for the nausea.

05:27.046 --> 05:29.452
And observe her for a few hours.

05:29.465 --> 05:32.500
Honey, did you hear that. We're gonna
stay here so they can take care of you.

05:32.709 --> 05:36.043
- I hate it here!
- Wait- Okay.

05:36.254 --> 05:38.627
- Looking for me?
- Yo, Dr. Pete.

05:38.841 --> 05:41.166
I've got one seriously hot appy for you.

05:41.385 --> 05:43.176
- Hot appy?
- Ready to be sliced and diced.

05:43.387 --> 05:45.179
Why don't you call for a surgical consult?

05:45.348 --> 05:46.634
- I told you.
- Thought you'd want it.

05:46.669 --> 05:49.136
- He can't do general surgery.
- I don't do general surgery.

05:49.351 --> 05:50.541
- Told you.
- Thanks, Connie.

05:50.542 --> 05:51.842
You're welcome Doctor Dave.

05:51.854 --> 05:56.273
I don't blame you. Hernias, appys-
Boring, right?

05:56.308 --> 05:58.232
You're like me.
You like the guts, the glory,

05:58.294 --> 06:00.508
the bright lights, the big city.
We're cut from the same cloth.

06:00.543 --> 06:02.742
You know what means
"to be skating on thin ice"?

06:02.758 --> 06:04.438
Ok. This is me backing off.

06:05.868 --> 06:09.569
That's good. Stay up there
as long as you can. You're doing great.

06:10.498 --> 06:12.787
- Kerry, hi.
- Morning, Gabe.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.910
How much longer?

06:15.127 --> 06:18.912
The expulsion of flatus marches
to its own drummer, Mr. Rineberry.

06:19.132 --> 06:21.706
The more I fart the better I'll feel?

06:23.178 --> 06:26.463
To put it somewhat indelicately, yes.
I'll be back. Stay with him.

06:27.056 --> 06:28.087
Keep your eye on him, okay?

06:28.308 --> 06:31.013
- I was just gonna grab a cup of coffee.
- Great, I'll join you.

06:31.228 --> 06:34.561
So, you're starting your day with
a little splenic flexure syndrome?

06:34.773 --> 06:37.524
The guy, he didn't want to stand on his
head till I reminded him...

06:37.692 --> 06:39.021
gas rises.

06:39.235 --> 06:41.607
It seems like you're settling in well?

06:41.780 --> 06:43.523
- Everybody's been terrific.
- Good. Great.

06:43.698 --> 06:45.706
Mark Green is still pissing on trees-

06:45.785 --> 06:47.316
Do you want me to say something to him?

06:47.535 --> 06:48.994
- Dr. Lawrence?
- Yeah, Lily?

06:49.204 --> 06:51.279
- It's Lucy.
- Lucy. Sorry.

06:51.498 --> 06:54.369
Did you want to order Oxacillin
for the cellulitis in Four?

06:54.584 --> 06:56.275
Cellulatis in four.
Yeah, he should have some.

06:56.354 --> 06:58.748
You just didn't sign for it.

06:58.964 --> 07:00.506
Easily fixed.

07:01.050 --> 07:03.291
- Here you go. Thanks.
- Sure.

07:05.011 --> 07:08.477
Is it me, or are medical students
younger than they used to be?

07:08.512 --> 07:10.141
It's definitely the students.

07:10.176 --> 07:13.552
I haven't felt this old since
your class graduated from med school.

07:13.771 --> 07:15.051
My class?

07:15.230 --> 07:17.865
I remember your mom came by to me
and she was thanking me for...

07:17.933 --> 07:20.688
you know, for inspiring you to go
into emergency medicine.

07:20.903 --> 07:24.090
And the whole time she's talking
to me all I can think is: "My God,

07:24.125 --> 07:25.793
We're practically the same age."

07:25.878 --> 07:28.070
Oh, no. She had a year or two on you anyway.

07:28.285 --> 07:31.571
- How is she. How is she doing?
- She passed away a couple of years ago.

07:31.747 --> 07:35.995
- Oh, I'm sorry. That's rough.
- Yeah, it is.

07:36.210 --> 07:37.788
How is your family doing?

07:38.003 --> 07:41.289
All my ex-wives are alive
and living well.

07:41.507 --> 07:44.377
And your son was going into medicine too,
wasn't he?

07:44.594 --> 07:47.844
That was my dream, not his,
as he would say.

07:48.056 --> 07:51.222
Of course, he doesn't say much
of anything to me anymore.

07:51.434 --> 07:53.426
Families, huh? Go figure.

07:53.645 --> 07:55.436
Get away from me!

07:55.646 --> 07:56.975
Get away from me!

07:57.189 --> 08:00.938
- Get away from me!
- Sorry. Excuse us.

08:02.028 --> 08:04.021
- Think I'll have more cream.
- Sure

08:04.239 --> 08:07.358
I certainly never meant to convey
any deficiency at County.

08:07.575 --> 08:10.944
I could hardly anticipate a shootout. And
not everything in the account is negative.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.938
You're right and I particularly enjoyed
the description of Dr. Carter...

08:13.973 --> 08:16.827
clamping off his first aortic rupture
in an 8 years old.

08:17.043 --> 08:19.617
Yeah, which as the account clearly states,
was successful.

08:19.838 --> 08:21.914
Do you remember, Lizzie,
the point of this article?

08:22.089 --> 08:23.385
To toot County's horn.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.213
Actually, it was to toot my horn.

08:25.385 --> 08:29.489
Which is why you'd understand
that I'm disturbed that, not only...

08:29.524 --> 08:32.303
at getting heat on this from upstairs,
but at finding my picture in a sidebar...

08:32.517 --> 08:33.698
next to the obituaries.

08:33.777 --> 08:36.349
I'd gladly give up the front page.

08:39.191 --> 08:42.607
Lizzie, when I appointed you
Associate Chief it was for two reasons:

08:42.820 --> 08:45.489
One, to serve; Two to protect
my needs, my interests.

08:45.656 --> 08:47.363
But I've sensed some reluctance.

08:47.574 --> 08:49.816
- To what?
- Corralling Benton for one.

08:50.034 --> 08:52.074
- We settled that.
- Oh, have we?

08:53.497 --> 08:55.904
So, I haven't made a mistake
in appointing you?

08:56.083 --> 08:57.115
No, you haven't made a mistake.

08:57.334 --> 09:02.148
Good. By the way, there’s been some slop-over
from the Anspaugh administration.

09:02.183 --> 09:05.966
It seems Donald's still scheduling his own
surgeries. Speak to him about it, would you?

09:06.177 --> 09:07.802
You can't be serious.

09:08.012 --> 09:11.261
It's interfering with my schedule.
I'm completely serious.

09:13.225 --> 09:14.849
- Dr. Corday.
- Carter.

09:15.060 --> 09:17.182
Is Elaine Nichols' path report back yet?

09:17.355 --> 09:18.934
You'll need to speak to her about that.

09:19.149 --> 09:22.185
Right, of course, I will when she comes in
to have her sutures out, which...

09:22.401 --> 09:24.509
generally is about a week after
the operation, right?

09:24.544 --> 09:25.352
Generally.

09:25.387 --> 09:28.606
And in Elaine's case, that could be
some time today. This morning maybe.

09:28.824 --> 09:30.817
- Carter.
- This afternoon?

09:31.034 --> 09:33.277
- Carter.
- Yes?

09:34.914 --> 09:38.497
There's some chance it'll be
this afternoon, say around 3:00.

09:38.709 --> 09:41.711
Thank you. By the way,
loved the article.

09:44.967 --> 09:45.897
Tommy Stevens.

09:45.976 --> 09:49.545
- Attempted suicide by hanging.
- Yeah that makes one nasty rope burn, huh?

09:49.720 --> 09:52.638
- What?
- Finish up, Dumar. Vital signs.

09:52.849 --> 09:54.973
Shallow resp.

09:55.008 --> 09:57.096
I didn't want to intubate in the field
in case he broke his neck.

09:57.313 --> 09:59.186
Nice and easy. On my count:

09:59.398 --> 10:01.604
One, two, three.

10:02.442 --> 10:04.234
He's getting dusky. We need to tube him.

10:04.344 --> 10:06.478
- Will be a tricky intubation.
- Tricky is my middle name.

10:06.513 --> 10:09.358
- And potentially dangerous.
- Like I said, danger's my middle name.

10:09.573 --> 10:12.279
- Pulse ox down to 84.
- Let's get in.

10:12.495 --> 10:16.539
Whatever you do,
do not extend the neck.

10:16.749 --> 10:20.248
I'm as gentle as a kitten, sir.

10:20.586 --> 10:21.747
BP's still 80.

10:21.962 --> 10:24.038
Run another liter of saline.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.210
I can't see the cords.
We need to crike him.

10:27.426 --> 10:28.671
Hold on. Bag him.

10:28.886 --> 10:31.458
We need a fiberoptic laryngoscope.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.139
I'll get it.

10:33.682 --> 10:35.010
Fiberoptics. That is cool.

10:35.767 --> 10:37.725
- You ever done one?
- I've certainly seen them.

10:38.521 --> 10:41.475
- So, that's a no, huh?
- But, you Dr. Green could change all that.

10:41.690 --> 10:44.395
Ok, I'll give you one shot. Then it's mine.

10:44.609 --> 10:48.109
It doesn't look too bad.
Not very deep.

10:48.279 --> 10:50.523
Probably it just needs a couple of stitches.

10:52.284 --> 10:54.443
Did the paramedics bring you in?

10:55.913 --> 11:00.409
Would you get us some more
four-by-fours? We're running low.

11:00.625 --> 11:04.755
So your parents weren't with you
when this happened, huh?

11:04.964 --> 11:06.127
No.

11:06.340 --> 11:08.796
This may sting a little, Becky.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.297
How did it happen?

11:13.513 --> 11:15.471
He wasn't outside.

11:16.101 --> 11:20.264
- Who wasn't outside?
- Tommy. My boyfriend.

11:22.189 --> 11:23.352
Did he cut you?

11:24.150 --> 11:26.771
I didn't know they had a basement.

11:27.569 --> 11:32.232
I saw a light bulb hanging.
And there he was, right next to it.

11:32.867 --> 11:36.034
- In the basement?
- He tied a rope around a pipe.

11:36.745 --> 11:39.744
So I ran back up to the kitchen
and got a knife.

11:42.711 --> 11:44.611
And you used the knife to cut the rope?

11:44.703 --> 11:46.036
He just fell down.

11:47.423 --> 11:49.048
I couldn't hold him.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.547
- The knife slipped.
- And you cut yourself.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.214
Will he be okay?

11:56.433 --> 11:58.210
Did the paramedics bring him?

11:58.257 --> 12:00.680
They wouldn't let me come with him.
I came in a different ambulance.

12:00.895 --> 12:03.387
If you wait here, I'll go check
and see what I can find out.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.692
- Tell me when you're at the cords.
- About to make contact.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.690
- I'm there.
- Advance into the trachea...

12:11.865 --> 12:13.560
and slide down the tube.

12:13.675 --> 12:15.532
Yeah. The eagle has landed. Let's bag him.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.786
Okay. Let's get X-ray down here.

12:19.498 --> 12:21.242
Good breath sounds on both sides. Nice work.

12:21.417 --> 12:22.448
Thanks, boss.

12:22.668 --> 12:24.826
Pulse ox up to 91.

12:25.129 --> 12:26.955
This the suicide? Tommy?

12:27.173 --> 12:28.500
- How is he doing?
- Great.

12:28.716 --> 12:31.800
Neck is swollen up.
Couldn't even see the cords.

12:31.819 --> 12:34.841
Dr. Greene let me do a fiberoptic.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.722
It was like threading a needle.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.383
- How's he doing?
- He's pinking up.

12:39.601 --> 12:42.970
But with the prolonged oxygen deprivation
I'm not sure about his neuro status.

12:43.188 --> 12:44.848
Come one, he was blue for too long.

12:45.024 --> 12:46.898
You might be looking at veggie burger.

12:47.202 --> 12:48.647
Dr. Greene.

12:49.279 --> 12:50.821
Oh, God!

12:51.239 --> 12:52.402
- Tommy!
- Haleh.

12:52.574 --> 12:53.771
Come on.

12:53.991 --> 12:57.739
- Let's get you outside.
- Tommy! Is he all right?

12:57.954 --> 13:01.121
What does he mean?
Is he gonna be all right?

13:01.374 --> 13:02.868
- You a resident?
- Yeah.

13:03.084 --> 13:05.909
Well, you still need to learn
that every patient in here...

13:05.944 --> 13:10.541
...is somebody's boyfriend,
father, mother, son.

13:10.758 --> 13:13.250
They don't exist simply for you to learn
new and interesting procedures.

13:13.428 --> 13:16.428
- I didn't see her standing there.
- Well, next time open your eyes...

13:16.640 --> 13:18.548
before you open your mouth.

13:23.438 --> 13:24.718
What's with the new guy?

13:24.898 --> 13:26.368
Which new guy would that be, Malucci?

13:26.469 --> 13:28.344
Dr. Lawrence or you?

13:35.283 --> 13:37.904
Never said anything about
killing himself.

13:38.019 --> 13:40.061
It's not your fault, Becky.

13:40.481 --> 13:42.656
You should be thankful you found him.
He's got a good chance.

13:42.875 --> 13:47.252
I almost didn't go back inside.
I was gonna be late for school.

13:47.462 --> 13:49.122
But I don't know, I just did.

13:50.048 --> 13:52.884
- Were his parents there?
- No. At work.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.548
His dad. His mom lives in Florida.

13:55.763 --> 13:57.554
You know where does his father work?

13:57.764 --> 13:59.887
Some kind of construction.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.673
I don't really know him.
He's not around much.

14:04.439 --> 14:06.893
Are you sick? You don't look good.

14:07.108 --> 14:09.680
She's just a little tired.
Who do you belong to?

14:09.902 --> 14:12.274
Here, I'll make you better. Say "ah."

14:12.488 --> 14:14.610
Thank you, but this patient
already has a doctor.

14:14.782 --> 14:16.442
Let go of me!

14:16.658 --> 14:18.034
Robin!

14:18.245 --> 14:20.118
Wait one second. One second.

14:21.692 --> 14:24.789
- Your mommy is right over here.
- No! Let me go!

14:25.001 --> 14:26.890
I'm so sorry, Dr. Lawrence.

14:26.893 --> 14:29.164
No, that's quite all right.
I have that effect on women.

14:29.379 --> 14:32.251
May I have my stethoscope
back, please?

14:38.055 --> 14:39.135
When?

14:39.348 --> 14:41.840
20 minutes ago. He started
triggering the vent on his own.

14:42.059 --> 14:46.556
Tommy, my name's Dr. Greene.
You're in the hospital.

14:46.731 --> 14:51.192
Your girlfriend found you and cut you down.
The paramedics brought you in.

14:51.611 --> 14:52.642
What's his PO-2?

14:52.820 --> 14:55.691
98 percent on an FIO-2 of 21.

14:56.115 --> 14:59.402
Tommy, we have this tube down
your throat to help you breathe.

14:59.477 --> 15:01.285
But we can take it out, okay?

15:01.496 --> 15:05.079
- You extubating him?
- He's got good tidal volume.

15:05.291 --> 15:07.082
You gave us a scare, Tommy.

15:07.251 --> 15:09.161
I got it. Thanks.

15:09.379 --> 15:12.582
So, Tommy, what I want you to do...

15:12.758 --> 15:17.549
is take a deep breath and blow
out when I pull out the tube.

15:17.763 --> 15:18.960
Take a deep breath.

15:19.806 --> 15:22.131
All the way in. Good, good.

15:22.810 --> 15:24.767
And blow.

15:25.979 --> 15:27.354
Good job.

15:28.774 --> 15:30.601
It's gonna be a little tender.

15:32.735 --> 15:34.443
Don't try and speak right away.

15:34.654 --> 15:37.692
- Where's Becky?
- Becky's here. She's fine.

15:37.908 --> 15:39.486
She's worried about you of course.

15:39.660 --> 15:42.329
Says your mom's in Florida,
so we'll call your dad.

15:42.954 --> 15:45.077
You know his number at work?

15:45.665 --> 15:47.824
I could talk to him for you if you want.

15:48.126 --> 15:49.586
Pager number?

15:50.713 --> 15:54.046
Here. Look, why don't you write it?

15:56.051 --> 15:57.297
Okay. All right.

15:57.969 --> 15:59.380
When you're ready.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.977
- Dr. Lawrence, you have a second?
- Sure.

16:04.185 --> 16:05.928
Tommy, I'll be right back.

16:07.272 --> 16:08.599
What are you doing?

16:08.815 --> 16:09.936
Getting his father in here.

16:10.565 --> 16:12.314
We're working on it.
Chicago PD's working on it.

16:12.526 --> 16:15.148
Don't pimp the kid. He's suicidal.

16:15.321 --> 16:16.601
Calling a psych consult?

16:16.823 --> 16:18.482
- Yes.
- Good.

16:21.577 --> 16:23.819
Think I should find out the sex?

16:23.996 --> 16:27.662
Well, everyone is different.
Some people like to know, some don't.

16:27.876 --> 16:29.833
- What about you?
- I don't know.

16:30.629 --> 16:32.834
Oh, come on. You know.

16:33.715 --> 16:35.258
- You're a nurse.
- So?

16:36.267 --> 16:38.009
Seems like you'd know, that's all.

16:38.219 --> 16:42.846
Well, I figure there are few really
true surprises in life.

16:43.016 --> 16:45.638
- This is for your scrapbook.
- Thanks.

16:47.187 --> 16:48.350
Everything okay?

16:48.463 --> 16:50.970
Fine. Little small for 32 weeks.

16:51.191 --> 16:54.891
- We'll put you on prenatal vitamins.
- It's not too late?

17:00.116 --> 17:02.786
- Meg, are you smoking?
- No.

17:04.244 --> 17:05.574
I mean...

17:07.124 --> 17:08.286
not a lot.

17:09.001 --> 17:10.743
It's really bad for the baby.

17:10.919 --> 17:13.873
It can cause prematurity, low birth weight.

17:14.047 --> 17:16.336
I know. I know. I'm just-

17:16.549 --> 17:19.919
I'm just really stressed.
You know, I lost that stupid job.

17:20.137 --> 17:23.723
- At Doc Magoo's?
- I didn't move fast enough.

17:23.933 --> 17:26.684
Excuse me, you know,
I'm seven months pregnant!

17:28.854 --> 17:33.481
Well, you know, I could call a social worker,
see if they could get you some aid.

17:34.193 --> 17:37.562
How about here?
Do they need people here?

17:38.406 --> 17:39.899
Maybe the cafeteria?

17:41.366 --> 17:43.692
I don't know. I could check.

17:44.453 --> 17:46.826
That would be great. Thanks.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.908
If you promise to stop smoking.

17:51.585 --> 17:52.617
Deal.

17:52.837 --> 17:56.502
Dad, just have the insurance guy
call me here.

17:56.715 --> 17:59.254
Mark, we got a double trauma coming in.
Can you take it?

17:59.469 --> 18:02.223
Because Romano's called this emergency
meeting for spin control-

18:02.396 --> 18:04.755
- Dad, if you want to handle it why...
- Where's Benton?

18:04.974 --> 18:07.548
- He took up some MVA.
- Page Corday then.

18:07.768 --> 18:11.388
You can't catch me!
You can't catch me!

18:11.565 --> 18:12.596
No running.

18:12.774 --> 18:17.187
Hey, no running! Stop!
And that stuff is expensive!

18:17.403 --> 18:20.689
- I don't care! Daddy's rich!
- I'm calling Security.

18:20.906 --> 18:23.149
- Brat.
- Dad, I'll call you back.

18:23.367 --> 18:27.069
- What's up?
- My dad got his insurance canceled.

18:27.289 --> 18:28.319
Can you take it?

18:28.498 --> 18:31.748
Because all the department heads have to go
to this public relations meeting.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.210
This newspaper thing is a disaster.
I don't know what Elisabeth was doing.

18:35.421 --> 18:37.481
- What newspaper thing?
- Here.

18:37.499 --> 18:39.980
Seen Lawrence? I've got the neighbor
of the suicide kid.

18:40.015 --> 18:41.285
Says he's got the dad's number.

18:41.302 --> 18:42.762
- For Lawrence?
- Yes.

18:42.971 --> 18:44.465
I'll take it.

18:45.556 --> 18:46.933
Dr. Greene here.

18:47.142 --> 18:48.978
31-year-old male
in parachute accident.

18:49.058 --> 18:51.604
Bilateral tip fractures. Good vitals.

18:51.814 --> 18:55.514
- Your chute didn't open?
- My lines got tangled.

18:55.534 --> 18:58.707
- Four dead on scene.
- What about Larry?

18:58.787 --> 19:01.571
- Head trauma.
- What do you mean head trauma?

19:03.493 --> 19:05.650
51-year-old male, head and chest trauma.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.596
Intubated for agonal respirations.

19:07.671 --> 19:10.327
Blown pupil.
Dropped his BP to 90 over 60.

19:10.499 --> 19:13.120
Flip you for it. Come on,
the other guy just has leg fractures.

19:13.335 --> 19:15.908
- That's too bad.
- Come on, call it. It's your lucky day.

19:15.929 --> 19:17.968
Set up 0-neg on the rapid infuser.

19:18.041 --> 19:19.872
Look at you. I think lucky. You can't lose.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.334
- I'm not calling it, Dave.
- Pulse ox is dropping to 90.

19:22.511 --> 19:24.800
You're the man. It's your world.
I just live in it. Come on, call it.

19:25.013 --> 19:26.212
Heads.

19:26.974 --> 19:29.355
Ouch, hell! Sorry, buddy.
Stay away from blackjack tables.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.583
Give me a portable C spine, just the pelvis.

19:31.598 --> 19:34.137
Send off a trauma panel. Type cross by four.

19:34.315 --> 19:35.346
On my count.

19:35.525 --> 19:37.351
One. Two. Three.

19:37.526 --> 19:38.689
Talk to me, Carter.

19:38.861 --> 19:41.566
Fall from high.
Hypertense with severe head injury.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.015
Regular rate and rhythm.

19:43.052 --> 19:45.435
Traqueal shift to the left, survey says.

19:45.510 --> 19:48.320
Chest tube. 10-blade.
32 French. Let's go.

19:48.537 --> 19:51.574
Dave's your man.
I got the leg fractures.

19:51.874 --> 19:55.838
- Pressure is 80. Non-responsive.
- Pupils fixed and dilated.

19:55.855 --> 19:57.928
GCS, five.

19:58.715 --> 20:02.249
- Brave son of bitch for an old guy.
- He's 51.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.977
He was probably trying a canopy.

20:04.046 --> 20:05.922
It's a thing of beauty
when is done well, actually.

20:06.139 --> 20:08.096
- I'm in. Thoraseal.
- Need me?

20:08.308 --> 20:12.602
- We're okay. Horizontal mattress, Dave.
- Yeah, I know.

20:12.813 --> 20:15.101
- Where's Peter?
- He took up a hernia.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.346
A hernia?

20:16.424 --> 20:18.449
Don't worry, Evel Knievel is in good hands.

20:18.693 --> 20:19.772
Excuse me.

20:19.986 --> 20:24.695
- How about I throw in a subclavian?
- I don't think so. We have good access.

20:24.708 --> 20:27.464
- Art line?
- How about a thoracotomy, while you're at it?

20:27.577 --> 20:29.057
- Really?
- Dave.

20:31.164 --> 20:34.082
Chest is clear. He'll need a tetanus.

20:34.251 --> 20:37.336
Apply traction with dorsiflexion,
to disengage the talus.

20:37.546 --> 20:39.040
- Like this?
- Good.

20:39.256 --> 20:42.589
Now I apply anterior pressure
to the posterior calf.

20:42.801 --> 20:44.509
- I felt a pop.
- Good.

20:44.719 --> 20:46.178
- You guys okay in here?
- Got it covered.

20:46.388 --> 20:50.221
- Pedal pulse is stronger.
- Good. Nurse, call X-ray.

20:50.393 --> 20:51.423
You got it.

20:51.602 --> 20:53.808
- Ever do the Wick-catheter technique?
- No.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.825
- Today you're gonna try it.
- Good, can I help?

20:57.008 --> 20:58.435
Get a pressure monitor.

20:58.608 --> 21:01.016
Dave, I you to take this guy to CT.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.591
Can't you get a nurse to do that?

21:02.626 --> 21:04.729
He's got a critical head injury.
I need a doctor stay with him.

21:04.949 --> 21:07.321
- I was gonna help this guys out.
- I think we got it covered, Dave.

21:07.535 --> 21:12.113
I want a neuro check every five minutes.
And tell me if his pressure drops.

21:12.289 --> 21:14.448
- You won him fair and square, Dave!
- Oh, Gabe...

21:14.625 --> 21:16.851
my patient, the kid?
The neighbor called...

21:16.927 --> 21:19.500
and I got the dad's number. Okay, thanks.

21:19.714 --> 21:20.838
I'll get the transducer.

21:20.873 --> 21:23.247
Urine dip is four plus positive for blood.

21:23.258 --> 21:26.711
Get a cystogram. And let's get
X- ray in here for a post reduction film.

21:26.929 --> 21:29.551
- I heard you the first time.
- Right.

21:33.477 --> 21:35.517
- Where was I?
- Wick-catheter technique.

21:35.730 --> 21:39.348
Oh, right. Grab two pieces
of aught Dexon...

21:39.568 --> 21:41.227
All right.

21:41.486 --> 21:43.812
I've opened the peritoneal sac.

21:45.323 --> 21:48.277
- Can you see the fascial ring?
- Almost.

21:48.492 --> 21:50.545
I'm glad our schedules
synced up, Peter.

21:50.554 --> 21:53.617
It's been a long time
since we operated together.

21:55.458 --> 21:58.080
No adhesions to the anterior wall.

21:59.171 --> 22:02.005
Oh, there's another defect.

22:02.215 --> 22:04.042
We'd better do a Gortex repair.

22:04.217 --> 22:05.449
Metz.

22:05.844 --> 22:06.924
Hey, Elizabeth.

22:08.013 --> 22:10.683
Interesting article
in the paper this morning.

22:10.849 --> 22:14.549
Excuse me, Donald.
Peter, will you please step out?

22:14.770 --> 22:16.014
I'm in the middle of operating here.

22:16.187 --> 22:19.141
I'm sure Dr. Anspaugh can handle it.
Please step out.

22:19.176 --> 22:19.991
What's going on?

22:20.026 --> 22:22.349
Peter's a trauma fellow
and he should be down in the ER,

22:22.384 --> 22:24.278
not up here covering elective hernias.

22:24.488 --> 22:26.162
Right, but this patient needed surgery.

22:26.232 --> 22:28.655
And I was called down to cover
your multi-victim trauma.

22:28.750 --> 22:29.845
I was down there all morning.

22:29.919 --> 22:33.811
As you should be. Now for third time,
please, step out.

22:41.181 --> 22:44.162
Dr. Anspaugh, would you take over?

22:59.274 --> 23:01.729
- Hey, I saw you touch that.
- Barely.

23:01.943 --> 23:04.315
- Can't you make up your mind?
- Nothing looks good.

23:04.528 --> 23:06.651
How about a grilled cheese sandwich?
It looks less than a day old.

23:06.864 --> 23:10.150
- Mark, please.
- Here, this. It's on me.

23:10.368 --> 23:12.325
- I'm not gonna eat that.
- You've gotta eat something.

23:12.537 --> 23:15.656
I have a mother, thank you.
She calls every Sunday.

23:15.873 --> 23:19.040
That's nothing.
My dad called four times this morning...

23:19.252 --> 23:22.122
obsessing about this cypress tree
that he crashed into last night.

23:22.338 --> 23:24.627
- Is he okay?
- His pride's a little wounded.

23:24.842 --> 23:28.390
Front fender is extremely wounded.
And aparently the neighbor's...

23:28.403 --> 23:31.638
100-year-old cypress tree
is circling the drain.

23:31.848 --> 23:33.342
How about Jell-O?

23:33.558 --> 23:35.764
Everybody has room for Jell-O.

23:36.478 --> 23:38.554
- Got your employed discount card?
- Yeah.

23:38.772 --> 23:42.105
And I need to speak to the manager.
Is someone around?

23:42.317 --> 23:45.900
Viola Simpson. Acting like
she be the big boss right there.

23:46.112 --> 23:48.127
- Great.
- I saw you eating that carrot.

23:48.262 --> 23:49.968
Gotta pay for it.

23:51.076 --> 23:52.321
Okay.

23:53.746 --> 23:57.245
She's kept down the juice I gave her
and doesn't have any abdominal pain.

23:57.416 --> 23:59.068
She should be fine at home. Just...

23:59.153 --> 24:02.124
give her some fluids and come
back for vomiting or fever.

24:02.337 --> 24:04.496
Thank you, Dr. Finch. And you too, Yosh.

24:04.715 --> 24:08.976
You're welcome. She's been
a completely fascinating patient.

24:09.845 --> 24:11.562
Robin, Robin, we're going home.

24:11.597 --> 24:14.005
You wanna thank the nice
doctor and nurse?

24:14.015 --> 24:16.355
- No!
- Okay. Then hold my hand.

24:16.402 --> 24:18.394
- I don't want to hold your hand!
- Thanks again!

24:18.604 --> 24:21.605
Wait! Robin! No, no!
Don't go outside!

24:22.066 --> 24:26.941
- Okay, Mr. Raybush. Safe and sound.
- How was the CT?

24:27.112 --> 24:29.632
It looks like somebody scrambled
his brain with an egg beater.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.240
- A subdural?
- Wanna look?

24:31.450 --> 24:34.866
No. Mostly diffuse swelling,
microhemorrages. Nothing we can fix.

24:35.079 --> 24:38.080
- Have you seen Dr. Lawrence?
- In the lounge.

24:38.290 --> 24:41.660
All right, hyperventilate him.
Call Neurosurgery. Get an ICP monitor.

24:41.878 --> 24:43.621
Ok I think I'll check the board
and see what else is in, right?

24:43.797 --> 24:46.916
You track down his family. He's wearing
a wedding ring. He must have a wife.

24:47.133 --> 24:50.133
- Shouldn't a nurse do that?
- Only if you fail.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.014
Elaine?

25:06.944 --> 25:08.177
John.

25:09.823 --> 25:12.740
- How are you feeling?
- Lighter.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.616
Sorry. That's a stupid joke.

25:18.206 --> 25:19.581
May I sit down?

25:25.130 --> 25:26.789
I tried calling you.

25:27.507 --> 25:29.578
Dr. Corday said the tests are clear.

25:29.661 --> 25:32.133
My cancer hasn't spread.

25:32.345 --> 25:34.671
That's great news.

25:34.849 --> 25:38.217
- Yeah, so everyone says.
- But you don't feel that way?

25:40.353 --> 25:43.971
- I don't know what I feel.
- I think that's...

25:44.190 --> 25:45.768
probably normal.

25:45.983 --> 25:48.356
- I think most people probably-
- John.

25:48.988 --> 25:52.356
Sorry. I'll spare you the platitudes.

25:56.662 --> 26:00.529
- You waiting for Dr. Corday?
- Yeah, I'm...

26:00.750 --> 26:01.828
early.

26:02.710 --> 26:04.667
Maybe we can get together later.

26:06.213 --> 26:09.878
Go for a walk, get a drink or talk.

26:10.050 --> 26:12.042
- Talk?
- About anything except...

26:12.262 --> 26:15.179
...your surgery and
my miserable life here.

26:15.389 --> 26:18.509
- And what would that leave?
- Sports.

26:18.725 --> 26:22.309
Or music, or art, or the Y2K thing.

26:22.521 --> 26:24.977
Oh, yeah. The Y2K thing.

26:25.567 --> 26:29.149
- I'm grasping at straws here.
- Yeah.

26:29.162 --> 26:30.637
I see that.

26:31.639 --> 26:33.530
But I'm not giving up.

26:40.707 --> 26:41.952
Well...

26:43.084 --> 26:44.578
I guess I'm...

26:46.129 --> 26:48.038
probably free at 7.

26:51.050 --> 26:54.862
Mrs. Raybush, the parachute accident
was extremely serious...

26:55.030 --> 26:57.090
and he's in a coma.

26:58.933 --> 27:01.768
I think you need to get here
as soon as you can.

27:01.978 --> 27:03.437
You're in Dallas.

27:03.604 --> 27:06.939
Dallas. Right, of course.
Three-hour flight.

27:07.151 --> 27:08.462
I need to be honest with you.

27:08.552 --> 27:12.611
There is a good chance he won't be able
to hold out that long. I'm very sorry.

27:14.282 --> 27:15.693
Excuse me?

27:16.701 --> 27:21.363
You want to dictate a message and
have it read to him? I don't think-

27:21.582 --> 27:22.696
Do it.

27:23.792 --> 27:25.583
Of course I can do that.

27:26.461 --> 27:27.706
Yes, I have a pen.

27:27.721 --> 27:29.748
Dr. Greene, it's your dad.

27:30.841 --> 27:33.795
- Hey, Dad. What is it?
- Go ahead.

27:34.386 --> 27:38.051
He wants a replacement cypress.
Seems reasonable.

27:38.265 --> 27:42.476
How much? Well, I know it's a
100-year-old tree, but-

27:43.938 --> 27:45.974
Connie, who's that talking to Dr. Lawrence?

27:46.140 --> 27:48.599
It's the father of the kid, Tommy Stevens.

27:48.717 --> 27:51.735
Listen, dad, I gotta go.
You'll see we'll work something out.

27:51.945 --> 27:53.404
No, I'll call you later.

27:53.614 --> 27:56.865
- Yeah, I will. I'll call you later. Bye.
- I'm working two jobs.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.862
That's a hell of a lousy excuse.

27:58.897 --> 28:01.235
I had to take on extra projects.
We need the money.

28:01.270 --> 28:03.033
What? More than you need your son?

28:03.249 --> 28:05.324
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene. Can I be of some help?

28:05.543 --> 28:08.496
Yeah, you can get this guy out of my face.
He hasn't even let me see my son yet.

28:08.670 --> 28:11.023
Tommy is in a very fragile
state right now, Mr. Stevens.

28:11.058 --> 28:13.091
I'm not sure that it's good
for him to see you.

28:13.126 --> 28:17.423
- What the hell?! I'm his father!
- You mean like for an hour a day?

28:17.458 --> 28:19.727
Dr. Lawrence, just a minute.

28:19.762 --> 28:23.014
Mr. Stevens, you do have a right
to see your son.

28:23.228 --> 28:26.312
Can you take Mr. Stevens
down to Curtain Area 3?

28:26.481 --> 28:27.513
This way, Sir.

28:27.732 --> 28:30.188
- What was that about?
- He expects-

28:30.360 --> 28:32.684
- He's his father.
- Somebody needs to give this guy a talking-to!

28:32.862 --> 28:34.735
- That's not your job.
- The hell it isn't, man!

28:34.947 --> 28:37.902
- You don't know the details.
- I know enough!

28:39.911 --> 28:41.738
And what did you say her name was?

28:41.955 --> 28:44.813
Viola Simpson. She said she was
glad you have food experience.

28:44.874 --> 28:46.618
Was she glad to hear I was pregnant?

28:46.834 --> 28:49.752
Not glad is an overstatement,
but she didn't seem to care.

28:49.964 --> 28:52.419
- Your appointment is at 5:30.
- That gives me plenty of time.

28:52.633 --> 28:57.009
I can pick up my stuff at Magoo's
and still get home and change.

28:57.220 --> 29:00.224
- Thanks, Mrs. Hathaway.
- Carol. You're welcome.

29:00.340 --> 29:03.844
Let me know how it goes.
And stay off the cigarettes!

29:03.861 --> 29:05.472
Scout's honor.

29:06.062 --> 29:10.772
No. Not a retraction really,
just simply the other side of the story.

29:10.984 --> 29:13.190
Yeah. Well, think about it.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.729
- You wanted to talk?
- Please.

29:15.906 --> 29:17.484
Yes, thank you.

29:18.534 --> 29:19.732
Is it a bad time?

29:19.910 --> 29:21.886
No. Not if you don't mind my scrubbing.

29:21.962 --> 29:23.194
Not at all.

29:28.252 --> 29:30.161
Was this mirror always here?

29:30.380 --> 29:33.297
I believe it's a recent
Rocket addition.

29:33.507 --> 29:34.918
Whatever for?

29:35.092 --> 29:36.883
One can only imagine.

29:37.094 --> 29:41.259
God, I hate these caps.
I look like a Yorkshire pudding.

29:41.474 --> 29:44.261
- Elizabeth?
- Yes...

29:44.769 --> 29:48.601
I do need to talk to you, Donald.
I'm sorry to even have to mention it.

29:48.773 --> 29:51.857
Don apologize. Someone has to do
the devil's work.

29:52.026 --> 29:53.686
I'm relieved you see it that way.

29:53.904 --> 29:57.770
- And it's not easy managing colleagues.
- Yeah, I'm beginning to realize that.

29:57.991 --> 30:02.284
When I was doing my rotten job,
much of which you've recently taken on,

30:02.453 --> 30:04.492
I always tried to get
to the core of the issue.

30:04.997 --> 30:06.242
Right.

30:07.292 --> 30:11.124
Ask yourself this: Do you believe
Peter Benton is a good surgeon?

30:12.546 --> 30:14.006
Peter Benton?

30:14.215 --> 30:16.391
Yes, of course, he's an excellent surgeon.

30:16.467 --> 30:17.499
Ah, even better.

30:17.718 --> 30:21.551
Now, ask yourself this: Should County have
excellent surgeons on its staff?

30:21.765 --> 30:22.963
Absolutely.

30:23.559 --> 30:26.110
Then don't you think we
should all want Peter...

30:26.119 --> 30:29.010
to practice surgery
whenever he can?

30:31.107 --> 30:32.139
Yes.

30:32.359 --> 30:36.273
I do, actually.
I don't agree with Dr. Romano.

30:37.406 --> 30:40.904
One thing to keep in mind
in your new position:

30:41.118 --> 30:45.579
If you don't agree with
the dirty work, don't do it.

30:51.962 --> 30:55.496
Malooch. I've got a gnarly
split kneecap in Exam Two.

30:55.673 --> 30:58.878
- You're teasing.
- No. It's a disgusting mess. Your kind of case.

30:59.094 --> 31:02.760
- I got some reading to catch up on.
- Sure you do.

31:07.645 --> 31:09.186
What happened?

31:09.396 --> 31:11.473
- He coded.
- Dr. Benton called it.

31:11.691 --> 31:12.806
You called it?

31:12.983 --> 31:16.020
That's usually what I do when a patient dies.

31:18.197 --> 31:20.105
Oh, man.

31:20.490 --> 31:22.696
What the hell do I do with this?

31:23.702 --> 31:26.538
- The 4-year-old?
- She was here this morning.

31:26.748 --> 31:29.702
- I remember.
- I couldn't wake her up.

31:29.917 --> 31:33.333
Found her in V-fib,
unresponsive to defibrillation.

31:33.546 --> 31:34.874
Connie, get Cleo.

31:35.965 --> 31:38.088
- She's been down at least 30 minutes.
- Do something!

31:38.301 --> 31:41.005
We will, Mrs. Bourke,
everything we can.

31:41.221 --> 31:44.138
On my count: One, two, three. Gently.

31:45.141 --> 31:46.157
What happened?

31:46.192 --> 31:47.173
Cardiac arrest.

31:47.394 --> 31:50.079
- See anything earlier?
- Thought it was gastroenteritis.

31:50.173 --> 31:52.429
- Hold compresions. Check the rhythm.
- She's still in V-fib.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.354
- Paddles. Charge to 30.
- Is she gonna be all right?

31:55.568 --> 31:56.731
- Clear!
- Clear.

31:58.070 --> 31:59.102
Oh, my God!

31:59.906 --> 32:03.239
- Procainamide, 17 per kilo.
- Did she ingest anything?

32:03.410 --> 32:05.735
Just the Chinese food.
I already told Dr. Finch that.

32:05.912 --> 32:08.154
What about drugs, antidepressants,
toxics, insecticides?

32:08.332 --> 32:09.362
No.

32:09.582 --> 32:12.749
- Gas, bleach-
- Cleo, are you running this?

32:12.918 --> 32:17.539
Yes. Charge to 50. Think,
Mrs. Bourke. Iron tablets, detergents-

32:17.574 --> 32:20.210
We keep vitamins on the kitchen table.

32:20.427 --> 32:21.969
- Vitamins with iron?
- Yes.

32:22.471 --> 32:23.964
It's iron poisoning. Clear!

32:24.306 --> 32:25.681
- Clear.
- Oh, God!

32:25.891 --> 32:29.426
- She's asystole.
- Pupils are fixed and dilated.

32:30.396 --> 32:31.558
High-dose epi!

32:35.901 --> 32:39.436
- Connie, move her out.
- No, no. I want to stay.

32:39.613 --> 32:40.644
I want to stay.

32:42.115 --> 32:44.109
Oh, my God! I want to stay!

32:58.007 --> 33:00.165
Dr. Finch, you want atropine?

33:00.927 --> 33:03.215
Do you want atropine, Dr. Finch?

33:08.351 --> 33:09.549
No.

33:20.404 --> 33:22.398
We got a case number
from the Coroner's office.

33:22.574 --> 33:26.618
Why don't you see if you can track down
the family pediatrician?

33:31.916 --> 33:33.410
The nurses can do that.

33:35.503 --> 33:37.081
I wanna do it.

33:40.050 --> 33:41.758
I'm sorry.

33:41.968 --> 33:45.159
You know there'll be an M and M.
And there could also be...

33:45.194 --> 33:47.764
medical-legal issues.
Do you mind if I look over your notes?

33:47.933 --> 33:49.926
Chart's on the counter.

33:52.771 --> 33:55.261
What was your discharge impression?

33:56.024 --> 33:59.439
Food poisoning. Or a mild case
of gastroenteritis.

33:59.610 --> 34:01.719
You asked about household poisons?

34:01.797 --> 34:04.273
The mom said the house was childproofed.

34:04.291 --> 34:06.348
- Prescription meds?
- Out of reach.

34:06.418 --> 34:08.277
Did you ask about iron?

34:08.578 --> 34:09.610
No.

34:10.413 --> 34:12.620
I'm not sure I would have either.

34:14.668 --> 34:16.245
The chart looks good.

34:16.262 --> 34:18.270
Everything you did was
within the standard of care.

34:18.347 --> 34:20.353
Risk Management won't have a problem.

34:21.675 --> 34:23.103
Is that it?

34:25.469 --> 34:29.800
Cleo, you saw the child in the
second phase of the overdose.

34:29.975 --> 34:34.471
She looked and felt completely normal.
You did what anyone of us would have done.

34:34.688 --> 34:36.811
I should have asked.
Iron is on the differential.

34:36.981 --> 34:40.317
- So are 200 other things.
- I should've asked.

34:40.777 --> 34:42.771
You did everything you could.

34:43.697 --> 34:45.938
No, I didn't. She's dead.

34:46.617 --> 34:50.282
Malucci, did you call Public Health
about that bat bite?

34:50.496 --> 34:53.496
That guy in Exam Three
needs a rabies series.

34:53.565 --> 34:56.952
He died on me. The parachute guy.

34:57.169 --> 35:00.005
Massive head injuries.
Didn't stand much of a chance.

35:00.756 --> 35:03.111
I wrote what his wife wanted
to tell him on the spot.

35:03.112 --> 35:05.466
But he died before I had time to read it.

35:06.262 --> 35:08.884
You took the message
more for her than for him.

35:09.098 --> 35:12.633
I guess. It just feels weird
throwing it away now.

35:13.395 --> 35:17.261
She said some really nice things.
Private things.

35:17.482 --> 35:19.190
I've got a bad nosebleed.
Can someone take it?

35:19.359 --> 35:20.390
If we had a bed.

35:20.610 --> 35:24.524
- Why is that rhinitis still in Four?
- I don't know. Ask Dr. Lawrence.

35:24.697 --> 35:27.698
Let me. I think I know where he is.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.204
I used to work all the time.

35:34.708 --> 35:37.709
Even volunteered for
the shift at Christmas.

35:37.919 --> 35:40.410
Didn't mean I didn't love my kids.
Dads are like that.

35:40.630 --> 35:41.744
How you feeling, Tommy?

35:43.007 --> 35:44.238
Okay.

35:44.885 --> 35:47.127
His blood gas is back. Good PO-2.

35:47.304 --> 35:48.335
Good. Thanks.

35:48.555 --> 35:51.093
Tommy's father had to leave.

35:51.808 --> 35:54.560
- Back to work.
- There was a problem at the site.

35:56.479 --> 35:59.434
- Were you able to talk to Dr. DeRaad?
- The shrink?

35:59.650 --> 36:02.568
It's hard talking to somebody
you don't know.

36:02.736 --> 36:04.279
They're here to listen.

36:04.488 --> 36:07.405
- I'm not crazy.
- I didn't say that.

36:07.574 --> 36:12.533
I just- I know you think
it's stupid. But I love her.

36:13.122 --> 36:16.621
- I mean, I really love her.
- Who? Your girlfriend?

36:17.125 --> 36:20.541
And she loved me.
And then suddenly she didn't.

36:21.296 --> 36:24.748
How can somebody love you so much,
then just stop?

36:24.926 --> 36:29.718
- When did she tell you?
- I didn't believe her till today.

36:38.940 --> 36:41.098
Lizzie. You talk to Anspaugh?

36:41.276 --> 36:43.233
- Yes.
- How did he take it?

36:43.444 --> 36:45.401
I didn't discuss it with him.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.398
Didn't get around to it?

36:47.615 --> 36:49.639
I hope you offered me
this position you did it...

36:49.710 --> 36:52.566
because my surgical skills aside,
you trust my judgment.

36:52.601 --> 36:53.434
Naturally.

36:53.454 --> 36:55.882
Now if I'm here to protect your interests
I have to tell you...

36:55.917 --> 36:58.533
it's in your best interest
to keep Donald Anspaugh happy.

36:58.752 --> 37:01.953
Not only is he a great asset
to the surgical staff and to you...

37:01.988 --> 37:04.418
but he is also on special consideration.

37:04.633 --> 37:07.468
Now if this interferes with your tennis
lessons in any way then I'm sorry-

37:07.636 --> 37:09.378
I don't play tennis.

37:09.596 --> 37:13.261
Whatever. The point is, if you want to push
Donald out, you'll have to do it yourself-

37:13.474 --> 37:17.223
Who said anything about
pushing him out?

37:17.438 --> 37:19.810
Well, I assume this is the first step.

37:21.983 --> 37:26.312
Lizzie, when you "assume,"
you make an "ass" of "u" and "me. "

37:28.114 --> 37:31.318
- What?
- Look, I just wanted Fridays off.

37:31.785 --> 37:34.111
I thought you could talk
to Donald about the schedule.

37:34.287 --> 37:36.493
But If you're not comfortable
doing it, I understand.

37:38.124 --> 37:39.784
Yeah, that's all right.

37:45.633 --> 37:47.459
You're feeding it wrong.

37:47.577 --> 37:49.216
Try folding it longways.

37:49.228 --> 37:53.380
And then flip up the corners
and fold it flat.

37:53.598 --> 37:56.636
Or you can just tell me
to mind my own business.

37:56.652 --> 37:59.290
- Go ahead.
- I'm kidding.

37:59.604 --> 38:02.274
I use quarters myself.
What do you want?

38:02.309 --> 38:03.362
Coke.

38:03.775 --> 38:07.359
Caffeine, the ER doc's best friend.

38:07.530 --> 38:11.693
Tommy went up to Medicine.
DeRaad put him on a hold.

38:12.034 --> 38:13.908
You don't have to fill me in.

38:14.454 --> 38:17.656
I jumped to conclusions with his dad.
I wanted to help.

38:17.873 --> 38:20.031
- Wanna sit down?
- Sure. Thanks.

38:20.208 --> 38:22.701
Well, the kid's in trouble.

38:22.878 --> 38:25.832
You know, you go to the parents first.

38:26.049 --> 38:29.084
Dad was still an ass
for going back to work.

38:30.761 --> 38:33.763
- You have a family?
- A daughter.

38:34.683 --> 38:35.845
You divorced?

38:38.686 --> 38:40.264
Get to see her a lot?

38:40.813 --> 38:42.687
She lives in St. Louis.

38:45.025 --> 38:47.600
You know, when I was about your age...

38:50.031 --> 38:52.948
my son was brought into the ER.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.235
He'd fallen out of a tree.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.528
They patched him up, good as new.

39:00.084 --> 39:03.702
Later I realized he had
jumped from the tree.

39:05.964 --> 39:07.921
He wanted to come see me.

39:09.508 --> 39:11.667
- That was then-
- Dr. Lawrence?

39:11.886 --> 39:13.796
Mr. Henderson's going to the O.R.

39:13.973 --> 39:15.301
I just need you to you sign his chart?

39:15.516 --> 39:16.796
I can do that.

39:16.817 --> 39:18.642
- Thanks for the Coke.
- You bet.

39:18.852 --> 39:23.064
- Did you check a second crit?
-38, and the EKG was normal.

39:23.273 --> 39:26.975
I reviewed the films with
Radiology. And you were right.

39:27.194 --> 39:31.654
- The cystogram was normal.
- Why did you get a cystogram?

39:32.324 --> 39:35.075
You ordered it when the urine
tested positive for blood.

39:35.285 --> 39:38.785
He had microscopic hematuria.
I ordered an IVP.

39:38.956 --> 39:39.987
No, you said cystogram.

39:40.166 --> 39:42.242
I wouldn't order one for 30 red cells.

39:42.260 --> 39:43.788
You did.

39:44.003 --> 39:48.498
Lucy, I've treating trauma patients
for 30 years. I think I know what I ordered.

39:49.132 --> 39:51.803
- Get an IVP before he goes up.
- He's already on his way.

39:52.095 --> 39:54.420
Catch him and get him to Radiology.

39:54.597 --> 39:56.969
He's not going to surgery without an IVP.

40:02.187 --> 40:04.194
Sutured the scalp lac. Bye.

40:04.265 --> 40:05.597
Sign out your patients?

40:05.817 --> 40:08.522
Hold on. You forgot this.

40:13.916 --> 40:15.824
Hey, Dad. It's Mark.

40:15.893 --> 40:18.977
Nothing. I'm just calling to see
how you're doing.

40:19.789 --> 40:22.362
- I'm sure it's a mistake.
- See you, Mark.

40:22.542 --> 40:23.573
You're taking off?

40:23.793 --> 40:27.292
I gotta go home soak my feet,
and the rest of my body.

40:27.504 --> 40:29.711
- Carol?
- Meg, how did it go?

40:29.924 --> 40:31.633
- I screwed up.
- What happened?

40:31.843 --> 40:34.142
I missed the interview.
I thought you said 6:30...

40:34.213 --> 40:37.020
but it was 5:30. I blew it.

40:38.350 --> 40:40.223
It's not true.

40:40.894 --> 40:44.145
- I couldn't go through with it.
- Why not?

40:45.524 --> 40:49.059
No one wants to hire a pregnant woman.

40:49.277 --> 40:52.812
And I can't blame them.
Why should I waste their time?

40:52.831 --> 40:55.604
I'm gonna have to quit in a month anyway.

40:55.825 --> 40:57.236
Meg, stop.

40:57.453 --> 41:01.070
We're gonna go together
and work something out, okay?

41:01.290 --> 41:04.160
- Coming in!
- Six years old. Fever-

41:04.376 --> 41:06.784
- Carter!
- I'm off in 15 minutes.

41:07.004 --> 41:09.673
- I got it.
- Pulse 140. BP 60.

41:09.882 --> 41:11.376
- What is it?
- No IV.

41:11.550 --> 41:13.210
- Cleo, you don't have to-
- What is it?

41:13.427 --> 41:16.262
Altered with fever. Maybe meningitis.

41:17.264 --> 41:19.838
On my count: One, two, three, lift.

41:20.058 --> 41:22.728
CBC, blood cultures, chem panel.

41:24.271 --> 41:26.062
Let's get a line in.

41:26.231 --> 41:29.683
- Dry as a bone.
- No response to painful stimuli.

41:29.901 --> 41:33.152
- No veins. Can't get a draw.
- Call Surgery.

41:33.363 --> 41:36.863
- I'll try a central line.
- His veins are collapsed.

41:37.077 --> 41:39.199
If I can't do it, call Surgery.

41:39.412 --> 41:41.618
Systolic's down to 50. Pulse 145.

41:42.081 --> 41:43.112
Okay, do it.

41:43.332 --> 41:44.443
Cutdown tray now.

41:44.517 --> 41:48.084
Two liters of saline,
one at the ankle, one at the head.

41:48.295 --> 41:50.585
- Pulse ox 92.
- Here's the blood.

41:50.799 --> 41:52.957
- Get a crit.
- I want a bolus...

41:53.175 --> 41:55.927
...of 20 per kilo, about 400 cc's.

41:56.095 --> 41:59.262
Run in a gram of ceftriaxone
and catch a urine.

41:59.432 --> 42:00.511
I'm in. Let's go.

42:00.724 --> 42:04.972
Dr. Weaver, I have Robin Bourke's
pediatrician on line two.

42:05.188 --> 42:07.940
- Cleo, you got this?
- Yeah, I got this.

42:08.149 --> 42:10.936
Send up a UA and culture.
I'll do an LP.

42:11.611 --> 42:13.686
- Carter, you have a second?
- Not really.

42:13.705 --> 42:17.405
Did you hear Dr. Lawrence
order that cystogram for Mr. Henderson?

42:17.617 --> 42:19.657
- Gross hematuria?
- No, just microscopic.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.008
- You don't need one.
- That's what I thought...

42:21.143 --> 42:22.408
but he told me to order it.

42:22.422 --> 42:24.947
- You must have heard him wrong.
- No, he said cystogram.

42:25.166 --> 42:28.666
Dr Lawrence wouldn't order a cystogram
for microscopic hematuria.

42:28.879 --> 42:31.411
It seemed strange to me but I figured
he knew what he was doing.

42:31.446 --> 42:34.873
He does know what he's doing.
You ran the wrong test. See you tomorrow.

42:49.358 --> 42:52.857
"I love you Larry, the girls love you,
you've been the best husband and father...

42:53.069 --> 42:56.024
the love of our lives,
our true north.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.067
You could never leave us...

42:59.284 --> 43:01.573
you'll be with us and in us.

43:01.786 --> 43:03.447
We'll love you always."

43:09.337 --> 43:13.417
- What did you tell him?
- That I spoke to the adjuster and agreed...

43:13.632 --> 43:15.874
...to accept a late payment.

43:15.893 --> 43:18.880
- Except they canceled his policy.
- Right.

43:19.095 --> 43:23.176
- So who pays for the cypress tree?
- You're looking at him.

43:25.103 --> 43:28.554
- The dutiful son.
- Well, duty comes at a price.

43:28.773 --> 43:31.180
- You're gonna have to buy me dinner.
- Okay. Whatever you want.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.070
- Good, cause I'm hungry.
- What have you got?

43:34.278 --> 43:37.196
What have you got? Mark!

43:37.365 --> 43:38.693
Quit grabbing!

43:38.866 --> 43:42.734
- I'm gonna grab.
- I got it framed for your office.

43:42.953 --> 43:45.242
You've just lost dinner, mister.

43:45.457 --> 43:47.864
- Hey, Dr. Lawrence.
- It's Gabe.

43:49.127 --> 43:50.704
- You off?
- Almost.

43:50.921 --> 43:52.580
We are getting something to eat.
You care to join us?

43:52.797 --> 43:55.584
No, thanks, I still have
some dictations.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.004
We'll be at Doc Magoo's
if you change your mind.

43:59.179 --> 44:00.210
Right, thanks.

44:00.430 --> 44:02.885
- Have a good night.
- Yeah, You too. Good night.

44:04.862 --> 44:08.555
Not everybody gets to be
on the front page of a newspaper.
