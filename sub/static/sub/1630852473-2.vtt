ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.462 --> 00:06.631
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:07.424 --> 00:09.426
(lively music)

00:11.594 --> 00:12.679
(elephants trumpeting)

00:18.977 --> 00:20.186
MAN: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.562 --> 00:21.896
(moans)

00:21.980 --> 00:23.356
(screaming)

00:32.115 --> 00:33.616
MAN 2: <i>KU-6908.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:36.828
-PAUL: <i>Well, then, let's do this.</i>
-MAN 3: <i>Yeah.</i>

00:36.911 --> 00:38.496
PAUL: <i>You want me to do it
very breathy like that?</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:39.706
-MAN 3: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
-PAUL: <i>All right.</i>

00:40.081 --> 00:45.879
PAUL: <i>Whenever candle lights flicker,
where the air is deathly still,</i>

00:46.421 --> 00:50.467
<i>that is the time when ghosts are present,</i>

00:50.550 --> 00:54.763
<i>practicing their terror
with ghoulish delight.</i>

00:54.846 --> 00:56.097
(thunder rumbles)

00:56.181 --> 00:59.100
<i>Welcome, foolish mortal...</i>

01:00.226 --> 01:02.020
<i>to The Haunted Mansion.</i>

01:02.103 --> 01:03.688
(screams)

01:03.772 --> 01:05.315
NARRATOR: <i>The Haunted Mansion.</i>

01:05.398 --> 01:08.276
<i>One of the world's most beloved
theme park attractions.</i>

01:08.359 --> 01:09.903
Now can I go see The Haunted Mansion?

01:09.986 --> 01:12.864
<i>Packed to the rafters
with world-class illusions,</i>

01:12.947 --> 01:16.284
<i>this house of horrors
has become a timeless classic.</i>

01:16.367 --> 01:18.703
I remember it as a child.
I don't want it to change.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.163
The Haunted Mansion
has changed over the years.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.206
Don't change it.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.876
NARRATOR: <i>Reincarnated at Disney Parks
all around the world.</i>

01:24.959 --> 01:26.169
-In Tokyo...
-Paris.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.629
-Hong Kong.
-NARRATOR: <i>Known as...</i>

01:27.712 --> 01:28.671
-Mystic Manor.
<i>-Or...</i>

01:28.755 --> 01:29.631
Phantom Manor.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.258
NARRATOR: <i>This iconic attraction
has been scaring </i>

01:32.342 --> 01:33.760
<i>the daylights out of guests...</i>

01:33.843 --> 01:34.719
(shrieks)

01:34.803 --> 01:36.096
<i>...for over 50 years!</i>

01:36.179 --> 01:38.264
-They're all just hilarious.
-NARRATOR: <i>Hilarious?</i>

01:38.348 --> 01:40.308
That's not
what the mansion's supposed to be.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.185
-The mansion's supposed to be...
-(screams)

01:42.268 --> 01:44.479
-Scary.
-It could be scary. It could just be...

01:44.562 --> 01:45.855
-Foreboding...
-But also...

01:45.939 --> 01:46.981
Fantastical, but...

01:47.065 --> 01:48.608
-It's really quite...
-Comical.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.527
-NARRATOR: <i>Even... </i>
-Dare we say it... Funny.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.986
<i>-Funny?</i>
-Really not all that funny.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.863
(laughs)

01:55.073 --> 01:58.952
NARRATOR: <i>But the real story
of the darkest of Disney's dark rides,</i>

01:59.035 --> 02:01.830
<i>well, the truth
about that might scare you!</i>

02:01.913 --> 02:03.790
(laughs)

02:03.873 --> 02:07.585
<i>And if not the truth?
Then Walt's earlier work probably will.</i>

02:07.669 --> 02:09.671
(laughs)

02:10.213 --> 02:13.341
Walt did mention one day,
he said, "People like to be scared."

02:13.424 --> 02:16.469
NARRATOR: <i>In fact,
much of Walt's work had a dark side.</i>

02:17.011 --> 02:20.515
<i>Even back to "The Skeleton Dance" in 1929.</i>

02:20.598 --> 02:22.725
Well, it was all very crude and primitive.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.145
NARRATOR: <i>Look at 1940's</i> Fantasia.

02:26.062 --> 02:31.067
<i>So when the idea of a theme park came
to Walt, it only made sense that...</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:32.652
He always wanted a haunted mansion.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.864
It was in his ideas
from the very beginning.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.533
NARRATOR: <i>But these early ideas,
conceptually at least,</i>

02:38.616 --> 02:42.120
<i>are a pretty long walk
from where The Haunted Mansion ended up.</i>

02:42.203 --> 02:45.832
This was gonna be a walking attraction
in which people would be walking through

02:45.915 --> 02:46.958
the rooms and experiencing it.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.293
NARRATOR: <i>Whatever it was...</i>

02:48.376 --> 02:52.338
They couldn't quite get a grip
on what to do with The Haunted Mansion.

02:52.422 --> 02:56.009
So Walt has the animators just do sketches

02:56.092 --> 02:58.386
of what... what a haunted mansion
should have in it.

02:58.469 --> 02:59.971
NARRATOR: <i>And it was soon revealed...</i>

03:00.054 --> 03:02.015
They were really basically
little cartoons.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.018
That's not what
the mansion's supposed to be.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.477
The mansion's supposed to be scary.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.229
NARRATOR: <i>Well, yeah, didn't Walt say...</i>

03:08.313 --> 03:09.480
"People like to be scared."

03:11.399 --> 03:12.817
NARRATOR: <i>But on the other hand,</i>

03:12.901 --> 03:16.821
<i>Walt did admit to one of his
most trusted Imagineers, John Hench...</i>

03:16.905 --> 03:19.199
You could have a friendly feeling
about ghosts

03:19.282 --> 03:23.077
<i>if we made such that they were
like retired actors from the stage.</i>

03:23.578 --> 03:24.954
They loved an audience.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.790
NARRATOR: <i>Well, this slight indecision
wouldn't stop them,</i>

03:27.874 --> 03:32.045
<i>because when Disneyland opened
on July 17th, 1955...</i>

03:32.128 --> 03:33.004
Welcome.

03:33.087 --> 03:37.342
<i>...it wasn't funny or scary,
because there was no Haunted Mansion.</i>

03:38.176 --> 03:43.056
<i>And so, Walt dispatched lead
scary character designer Ken Anderson.</i>

03:46.142 --> 03:48.978
Ken Anderson actually designed some

03:49.062 --> 03:50.897
of the... the early concepts
for the attraction.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.565
NARRATOR: <i>Starting with the outside.</i>

03:52.649 --> 03:56.402
<i>Using these Southern
architectural designs as inspiration,</i>

03:56.486 --> 03:58.446
<i>all Ken had to do was just...</i>

03:58.529 --> 04:00.490
<i>add a few cobwebs, some broken windows,</i>

04:00.573 --> 04:04.118
<i>a few spiders,
and, just generally, haunted things.</i>

04:04.202 --> 04:06.746
We wanted this haunted house
to be kind of ruined.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.164
JOHN: <i>Shutters would be crooked.</i>

04:08.248 --> 04:10.833
It would be some
kind of house disintegrating.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.168
NARRATOR: <i>But...</i>

04:12.252 --> 04:13.461
Walt said, "No."

04:13.544 --> 04:16.589
NARRATOR: <i>Because for as much
as Walt wanted a haunted house...</i>

04:16.673 --> 04:19.759
He really wanted The Haunted Mansion
to be as clean

04:19.842 --> 04:21.636
<i>and well-kept as the rest of his park.</i>

04:21.719 --> 04:25.556
NARRATOR: <i>So, instead of the grimy
ghost trains of 1960s carnivals...</i>

04:25.640 --> 04:27.141
Walt's vision was that he wanted

04:27.225 --> 04:29.185
the exterior of the mansion
to be pristine,

04:29.602 --> 04:32.063
and the interior
is what would be dilapidated.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.857
And he said, you know,
"We'll take care of the outside

04:34.941 --> 04:36.859
and we'll let the ghosts
take care of the inside."

04:36.943 --> 04:38.736
NARRATOR:
<i>That's all well and good. However...</i>

04:38.820 --> 04:41.197
Nothing had been designed
to be inside of it.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.865
<i>So, dusting off the cobwebs,</i>

04:42.949 --> 04:46.202
<i>Walt turned to another Imagineer
for his take.</i>

04:46.286 --> 04:48.871
DANIEL: <i>Yale Gracey worked
at Walt Disney Animation.</i>

04:48.955 --> 04:53.001
And eventually, he was a member
of the Magic Castle in Hollywood,

04:53.084 --> 04:57.714
so he did stage performance magic,
but had never done theme park magic.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.216
-NARRATOR: <i>Who had?</i>
-Nobody had ever done theme park magic.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.761
NARRATOR: <i>Well, there's no hiding
Daniel Joseph's admiration</i>

05:03.845 --> 05:05.471
<i>for this master magician.</i>

05:05.555 --> 05:08.516
Yale Gracey, for me,
was my Michael Jordan.

05:08.599 --> 05:12.812
I mean, I had pictures of Yale Gracey
on the wall,

05:12.895 --> 05:16.065
growing up in my little
bedroom in Delaware.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.235
NARRATOR: <i>But this pinup heartthrob
was already taken.</i>

05:19.777 --> 05:21.779
He was partnered up with Rolly Crump.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.948
NARRATOR: <i>Who has a few fans of his own.</i>

05:24.032 --> 05:25.992
I love Rolly Crump. He's such a great guy.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.578
VANESSA: <i>He designed
the Tower of the Four Winds</i>

05:28.661 --> 05:32.081
<i>at the 1964-'65 New York World's Fair.</i>

05:32.165 --> 05:34.709
-How tall is the real tower, Rolly?
-It's 120 feet.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.712
NARRATOR: <i>But this was a job Rolly knew
he was destined for</i>

05:37.795 --> 05:40.048
<i>ever since he wasn't very tall at all.</i>

05:40.131 --> 05:43.217
I always wanted to work for Disney
from the time I was three,

05:43.301 --> 05:45.803
'cause the first film I saw
was the <i>Three Little Pigs.</i>

05:46.054 --> 05:48.514
ROLLY: <i>I told my mom at the time,
"I wanna work for Disney."</i>

05:48.598 --> 05:50.641
She said, "Well, someday maybe you will."

05:50.725 --> 05:53.061
NARRATOR:
<i>Like most mothers, she wasn't wrong.</i>

05:53.144 --> 05:57.190
My first film was <i>Peter Pan</i>
and then the <i>Lady and the Tramp.</i>

05:57.607 --> 06:00.318
ROLLY: <i>So, that's what I did.
I just worked in animation.</i>

06:00.401 --> 06:03.154
NARRATOR: <i>Rolly did rack up
an impressive credits list,</i>

06:03.237 --> 06:07.950
<i>along with a bit of a reputation
that followed him his whole career.</i>

06:08.034 --> 06:13.039
Rolly, ended up becoming my boss.
He was wild. I mean, he was a wild guy.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.584
NARRATOR: <i>And so, for the wild Rolly
and magical Yale,</i>

06:16.667 --> 06:18.211
<i>Walt's instructions were simple.</i>

06:18.294 --> 06:21.089
Walt just wanted a lot of good ideas.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.673
NARRATOR: <i>And so, the two got to work,</i>

06:22.757 --> 06:25.760
<i>conjuring up things
for Walt's Haunted Mansion.</i>

06:25.843 --> 06:29.764
Yale and I had this big room
filled with weird, scary stuff.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.517
Well, we got a call
from Personnel one day,

06:32.600 --> 06:33.768
and they said, um...

06:34.310 --> 06:38.815
ROLLY: <i>"The janitors would like to have
you leave the lights on in that room."</i>

06:39.315 --> 06:40.983
Maybe 'cause when
we turned the lights out,

06:41.067 --> 06:43.778
it was pretty spooky,
'cause a lot of stuff was lit

06:43.861 --> 06:45.321
<i>-with black light.</i>
-(woman shrieks)

06:45.405 --> 06:46.989
<i>Which meant it glowed in the dark.</i>

06:47.073 --> 06:48.074
And so, Yale and I said,

06:48.157 --> 06:52.120
"Oh, okay, uh, if that's the case,
uh, we'll do a little something here."

06:52.578 --> 06:55.081
We rigged the whole room.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.376
And we had the whole thing
on a little timer.

06:58.459 --> 07:01.504
<i>We triggered everything
to take off during the night.</i>

07:04.006 --> 07:06.050
-(bell dings)
-(disembodied voices)

07:06.509 --> 07:08.136
We came back the next day.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.472
Personnel called us the next day and said,
"They're never coming back.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.266
You're gonna have to clean up
your room yourself."

07:13.349 --> 07:16.477
NARRATOR: <i>Flying in the face
of Walt's one clear instruction...</i>

07:16.561 --> 07:20.273
The Haunted Mansion should be as clean
and well-kept as the rest of his park.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.693
NARRATOR: <i>Rolly and Yale continued
to develop ideas amidst</i>

07:23.776 --> 07:26.571
<i>the squalor of youthful creativity.</i>

07:26.654 --> 07:27.822
And we were having a great time.

07:27.905 --> 07:28.906
(applause)

07:28.990 --> 07:32.326
NARRATOR: <i>And so was the entire
Disney staff from the looks of it,</i>

07:32.410 --> 07:33.828
<i>because construction work</i>

07:33.911 --> 07:38.583
<i>finally began on Walt's long-sought-after
house of ghosts.</i>

07:38.666 --> 07:40.543
And then the World's Fair came along.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.462
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, yes, the World's Fair.</i>

07:42.545 --> 07:45.590
<i>An immensely important phase
in Disneyland's development,</i>

07:45.673 --> 07:50.052
<i>but also one that would absorb years
of Walt and the Imagineers' time.</i>

07:50.136 --> 07:54.056
<i>As a result, work on The Haunted Mansion
project... expired.</i>

07:54.140 --> 07:57.351
For many years, The...
The Haunted Mansion, lay dormant here.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.519
(laughs)

07:58.603 --> 07:59.562
The gates were closed.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.148
Guests were wondering,
"Why can't we go in?"

08:02.231 --> 08:03.983
And so, a sign was placed out front.

08:04.066 --> 08:08.529
NARRATOR: <i>A sign of what was to come
for the story of this apparitious abode.</i>

08:08.905 --> 08:11.991
Walt talked about wanting
to build a retirement home

08:12.074 --> 08:15.661
for all these 999 happy ghosts and haunts.

08:15.745 --> 08:20.208
GARY: <i>And so, of course, Disney legend
Marty Sklar had taken his cue from Walt</i>

08:20.291 --> 08:25.338
and written a plaque that spoke to it
being a retirement home

08:25.421 --> 08:29.509
<i>and that guests could apply
to Ghost Relations in order to stay there.</i>

08:29.592 --> 08:31.719
NARRATOR:
<i>There weren't too many takers for that.</i>

08:31.802 --> 08:35.848
<i>But what Disney failed to gain
in ghostly reservations in Anaheim</i>

08:35.932 --> 08:39.769
<i>was more than made up for
for the experience gleaned in New York.</i>

08:39.852 --> 08:43.439
We learned so much at the World's Fair
in terms of new means

08:43.523 --> 08:45.483
<i>of entertaining our guests
through Audio-Animatronics</i>

08:45.566 --> 08:48.277
and the ride systems that came out
of the research and development

08:48.361 --> 08:49.320
<i>of the World's Fair.</i>

08:49.403 --> 08:50.947
NARRATOR: <i>And with this new knowledge,</i>

08:51.030 --> 08:55.868
<i>work began in earnest on a brand-new area
of Disneyland called...</i>

08:55.952 --> 08:57.286
WALT: <i>New Orleans Square.</i>

08:57.370 --> 08:59.163
New Orleans Square is not a square.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.665
NARRATOR: <i>Right. But still!</i>

09:00.748 --> 09:03.626
<i>The flagship attraction
for this New Orleans...</i>

09:03.709 --> 09:05.378
It... it's sort of a trapezoid.

09:05.461 --> 09:09.840
<i>...would finally be
the Pirates of the Caribbean?</i>

09:09.924 --> 09:10.883
(laughs)

09:10.967 --> 09:12.260
We moved ahead with the pirates.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.971
Everyone was really
all hepped-up on doing that.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.432
NARRATOR: <i>As well as being
a treasure chest of World's Fair wizardry</i>

09:18.516 --> 09:22.395
<i>unlike Haunted Mansion,
Pirates had a clear artistic direction.</i>

09:22.478 --> 09:24.730
We've always been partial
to pirate stories.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.274
NARRATOR: <i>They still didn't even know</i>

09:26.357 --> 09:29.360
<i>if The Haunted Mansion
was meant to be funny or scary.</i>

09:29.443 --> 09:33.155
The show never was to a point
where I think he was comfortable

09:33.239 --> 09:34.991
with... with going ahead with it.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.034
NARRATOR: <i>So for Walt,
Pirates of the Caribbean </i>

09:37.118 --> 09:38.244
<i>became the priority.</i>

09:38.327 --> 09:41.622
<i>And for the empty Haunted Mansion,
that ship had sailed.</i>

09:41.706 --> 09:45.710
<i>Or, you know, ran on a shallow track.
But not for long,</i>

09:45.793 --> 09:49.964
<i>because that empty house over there
was getting a little awkward.</i>

09:50.047 --> 09:53.384
I grew up in the '60s,
so I was one of those kids drooling

09:53.467 --> 09:55.970
at the gate like, "When are... when are
they gonna open this thing up?"

09:56.053 --> 09:58.389
And then all the rumors.
"A lady fell in a pit."

09:58.472 --> 09:59.932
"There was a snake pit." Blah, blah, blah.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.267
NARRATOR: <i>Blah, blah, nah.</i>

10:01.350 --> 10:02.518
I always wondered about that.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.854
NARRATOR: <i>But there was
really nothing mysterious afoot.</i>

10:04.937 --> 10:08.858
<i>Rather, Walt wanted to make sure Pirates
was well on its way</i>

10:08.941 --> 10:10.943
<i>before focusing efforts on The Mansion.</i>

10:11.027 --> 10:13.946
<i>And once it became clear
that the Pirates project</i>

10:14.030 --> 10:15.740
<i>was coming to a... head...</i>

10:15.823 --> 10:19.076
<i>Walt was ready to plunge headlong
into The Mansion.</i>

10:19.660 --> 10:22.622
<i>By plundering legendary
Imagineer Marc Davis</i>

10:22.705 --> 10:25.416
<i>away from working
on Pirates of the Caribbean,</i>

10:25.916 --> 10:28.044
<i>which he lovingly referred to as...</i>

10:28.127 --> 10:32.006
The, uh, pirate ride,
which came along there somewhere.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.634
NARRATOR: <i>Well, that was
a pretty clear signal from Walt</i>

10:34.717 --> 10:38.763
<i>that he was leaning more toward taking
The Mansion in a humorous direction,</i>

10:38.846 --> 10:41.057
<i>because while Marc had made
a name for himself</i>

10:41.140 --> 10:44.727
<i>as a master animator
on many of Disney's classic films,</i>

10:44.810 --> 10:49.482
<i>he particularly excelled
at one specific aspect of his craft.</i>

10:49.565 --> 10:52.234
He was known
as the great gag man within animation.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.779
NARRATOR: <i>And they could use the help,
because...</i>

10:54.862 --> 10:57.114
We didn't know whether you were
gonna ride through this thing,

10:57.198 --> 10:58.741
walk through it, or what.

10:58.824 --> 11:02.286
<i>...with the confidence and proven
track record of Marc Davis...</i>

11:02.370 --> 11:05.414
And we did some paintings,
and they were quite fantastic.

11:05.498 --> 11:09.251
<i>...now things should be easy,
except for the fact that there were now...</i>

11:09.335 --> 11:11.003
Two art directors on Haunted Mansion.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.004
(laughs)

11:12.088 --> 11:13.589
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, one small detail.</i>

11:13.673 --> 11:17.635
<i>It would appear Walt hired Marc's
fellow Imagineer Claude Coats</i>

11:17.718 --> 11:21.639
<i>to share the art director post
on Haunted Mansion, because...</i>

11:21.722 --> 11:27.812
Walt knew he mainly got his best results
when he put opposites together.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.649
Claude Coats was more of a theatrical
set designer, if you will.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.193
Claude Coats was a straight arrow.
Straight arrow.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.529
NARRATOR: <i>So, kind of like
the opposite of Marc, then.</i>

11:36.862 --> 11:39.782
<i>But from an equally
prestigious background and reputation.</i>

11:40.408 --> 11:44.495
Claude was a beautiful background artist.
If you look at <i>Pinocchio</i>

11:44.578 --> 11:46.122
<i>and the beautiful street scenes...</i>

11:46.205 --> 11:47.206
He was amazing.

11:47.289 --> 11:51.711
Good architect, good designer.
Walt would use him... In my eyes...

11:52.253 --> 11:56.632
when he saw one of his attractions
starting to fall behind.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.510
NARRATOR: <i>While The Mansion
wasn't quite running behind just yet...</i>

11:59.593 --> 12:00.886
"When are they gonna open this thing up?"

12:01.345 --> 12:03.723
<i>...it hadn't exactly
hit its stride, either.</i>

12:03.806 --> 12:06.434
So, we have on one side Marc Davis saying,

12:06.517 --> 12:09.353
"I want this funny,
gag-driven haunted house.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.356
These are happy haunts that live here."

12:12.440 --> 12:15.192
DANIEL: <i>And then on the other side,
you have Claude Coats who's saying,</i>

12:15.276 --> 12:18.154
"You should go in and feel
the hot and cold running chills...

12:18.529 --> 12:20.698
-(thunder rumbles)
<i>-...as you go through this mansion."</i>

12:20.781 --> 12:24.535
So with that, as in any
creative organization, there's tension.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.954
NARRATOR:
<i>Thankfully, there was nothing but harmony.</i>

12:27.079 --> 12:31.417
<i>And mischief shared
between Yale Gracey and Rolly Crump.</i>

12:31.500 --> 12:35.254
And so, I had started
doing sketches of all my scary stuff.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.590
NARRATOR: <i>Because after all,
Walt had said...</i>

12:37.673 --> 12:38.966
"People like to be scared."

12:39.049 --> 12:40.176
NARRATOR: <i>But he had also said...</i>

12:40.259 --> 12:41.469
He wanted it to go funny.

12:41.552 --> 12:45.097
NARRATOR: <i>So what did Walt want?
It was time to find out.</i>

12:45.181 --> 12:46.974
"Okay, we're gonna have
a meeting with Walt.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.518
Everybody bring their sketches down
and their models."

12:49.602 --> 12:53.606
Then everybody didn't like the idea
that I was doing things that were scary.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.525
In fact, they didn't like that what...
anything I was doing.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.611
NARRATOR: <i>So much so that Rolly's stuff</i>

12:58.694 --> 13:02.198
<i>was strategically placed
behind Walt for the meeting.</i>

13:02.281 --> 13:04.575
And they did it on purpose
so he wouldn't see it.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.660
And all of a sudden, he says,
"What is that stuff?"

13:06.744 --> 13:08.496
And they said,
"Well, that's some stuff Rolly did."

13:08.579 --> 13:10.498
And he says,
"Well, what is it that Rolly did?"

13:10.581 --> 13:14.126
And I said, "Well, I just feel
that we need some scary stuff in there."

13:14.210 --> 13:16.212
NARRATOR: <i>The janitors probably disagree.</i>

13:16.295 --> 13:19.715
And so the next morning,
I came to work at seven o'clock.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.592
Walt's sitting in my chair.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.552
And the first thing he said to me was,

13:23.636 --> 13:24.678
-"You son of a..."
-(woman shrieks)

13:24.762 --> 13:25.971
And I thought, "Oh, my God."

13:26.055 --> 13:28.641
He says, "I didn't get an ounce
of sleep last night

13:28.724 --> 13:32.144
because what you showed me yesterday
kept me up all night long."

13:32.228 --> 13:34.688
And I said, "Oh, God, I'm sorry."
He says, "No, no.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.524
I know what you're gonna do
with your art. "

13:36.607 --> 13:38.400
I says, "You do?" He says, "Yeah."

13:38.484 --> 13:40.319
He said, "We're gonna do
a Museum of the Weird.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.822
<i>And you can do
all the weirdest stuff you wanna do</i>

13:42.905 --> 13:44.281
<i>and put it in the museum."</i>

13:44.365 --> 13:46.784
Oh, I said, "Oh, God, that was easy."

13:46.867 --> 13:49.703
NARRATOR: <i>But things were about
to get a little bit harder.</i>

13:49.787 --> 13:52.706
Walt Disney never lived
to see The Hunted Mansion completed.

13:53.624 --> 13:57.002
NARRATOR: <i>The impact of losing
their leader was vast,</i>

13:57.086 --> 14:01.006
<i>and the reality of a Walt-less Disneyland
was upon them.</i>

14:01.090 --> 14:03.342
They had lost their leader,
they were a bit directionless,

14:03.425 --> 14:05.803
but they still had to buck up
and get these things done.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.597
NARRATOR: <i>That, they could agree on.
But that was about it.</i>

14:08.681 --> 14:12.476
It didn't really have its final direction
when he passed away.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.729
So that's where it kind of
accelerate this...

14:16.397 --> 14:18.274
kind of pitched battle, if you will,

14:18.357 --> 14:21.151
between the forces
of fun and lighthearted...

14:21.610 --> 14:23.779
-NARRATOR: <i>...or...</i>
-...dark and sinister.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.741
NARRATOR: <i>So with two teams tasked
with making one attraction...</i>

14:27.825 --> 14:29.702
These guys are fighting amongst themselves

14:29.785 --> 14:32.162
and trying to figure out, you know,
what direction it should go in.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.790
NARRATOR:<i>Well, with the opening day
fast approaching,</i>

14:34.874 --> 14:37.501
<i>the gates of Walt Disney's Haunted Mansion</i>

14:37.585 --> 14:42.256
<i>would finally swing open,
revealing more than ten years of work</i>

14:42.339 --> 14:44.675
<i>by dozens of Imagineers,</i>

14:44.758 --> 14:50.806
<i>promising 999 ghosts,
with just a few outstanding questions.</i>

14:50.890 --> 14:54.935
<i>Did Claude make it scary?
Or did Marc make it funny?</i>

14:55.019 --> 14:57.396
<i>Did Rolly contribute enough weirdness?</i>

14:57.479 --> 14:58.522
What's inside that mansion?

14:58.606 --> 14:59.732
NARRATOR: <i>Let's find out, shall we?</i>

14:59.815 --> 15:02.526
1969, The Haunted Mansion
finally opened its gates.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.529
TOM: <i>It was one of Disneyland's
highest attendance days ever.</i>

15:05.613 --> 15:07.531
Obviously, with all those years
of waiting...

15:07.615 --> 15:09.283
Now can I go see The Haunted Mansion?

15:09.366 --> 15:10.534
NARRATOR: <i>By all means, Donny!</i>

15:10.618 --> 15:11.744
KURT: Come on, the line's moving.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.495
NARRATOR:
<i>And whether you were visiting alongside</i>

15:13.579 --> 15:17.166
<i>The Osmonds and Kurt Russell
in this 1970 TV special,</i>

15:17.249 --> 15:20.544
<i>or visiting today,
as you enter the mansion,</i>

15:20.628 --> 15:25.090
<i>your mood will change
as you stand inside a holding room</i>

15:25.174 --> 15:26.842
<i>and hear the immortal words...</i>

15:26.926 --> 15:31.680
PAUL: <i>Welcome, foolish mortals,
to The Haunted Mansion.</i>

15:31.764 --> 15:35.601
NARRATOR: <i>Words uttered
by legendary voice actor, Paul Frees,</i>

15:35.684 --> 15:38.520
<i>also known as the voice
of Ludwig Von Drake.</i>

15:38.604 --> 15:40.814
You don't know.
(screams)

15:40.898 --> 15:46.236
-NARRATOR: <i>But now...</i>
-PAUL: <i>I am your host. Your ghost-host.</i>

15:46.320 --> 15:48.030
-Oh, it's wild!
-(ghost laughs)

15:48.113 --> 15:49.740
It's like, okay, everybody's in.

15:49.823 --> 15:53.035
PAUL: <i>There's no turning back now.</i>

15:53.118 --> 15:58.082
NARRATOR: <i>Which is about when you realize
that you're not in a holding room at all.</i>

15:58.165 --> 16:00.042
Suddenly, the room starts stretching.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.502
Oh, the picture's moving!

16:01.585 --> 16:03.963
NARRATOR: <i>Stretching, but also sinking</i>

16:04.046 --> 16:07.174
<i>because you're actually standing
in one of two lifts</i>

16:07.257 --> 16:09.927
<i>designed to take guests six feet under.</i>

16:10.010 --> 16:11.929
<i>Or, you know, maybe it's further.</i>

16:12.012 --> 16:15.808
<i>And to distract you from the fact
that you're just going down an elevator,</i>

16:15.891 --> 16:19.561
<i>this optical illusion sprang
from the brilliance of Rolly and Yale,</i>

16:19.645 --> 16:22.481
<i>then adapted by Marc Davis.
You know, the funny one.</i>

16:22.982 --> 16:24.483
Tell her about this thing here,
will you, Marc?

16:24.566 --> 16:27.820
Oh, this is our, uh, elongating,
stretching room,

16:28.278 --> 16:30.447
and also some stretching portraits.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.908
NARRATOR: <i>So, thanks to those portraits
and the ghost-host,</i>

16:32.992 --> 16:35.285
<i>it's probably one point for funny, right?</i>

16:35.369 --> 16:38.330
(laughs)
We finally displayed the ghost-host...

16:39.081 --> 16:40.374
hanging by his neck.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.376
NARRATOR: <i>Ugh! Well, maybe not.</i>

16:42.459 --> 16:44.336
Lights go out with thunder,
and everybody screams.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.673
That whole introductory experience
totally puts you in the mood for,

16:47.756 --> 16:49.174
"What is the show is gonna be about?"

16:49.258 --> 16:51.135
NARRATOR: <i>Well, perhaps
what's at the bottom of that elevator </i>

16:51.218 --> 16:53.095
<i>might offer further clues</i>

16:53.178 --> 16:56.765
<i>as you walk down quite the moody hallway.</i>

16:56.849 --> 16:58.183
(thunder rumbles)

16:58.267 --> 17:00.477
Hey, look at the picture of the man
on the horse.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.939
NARRATOR:
<i>Now, speaking of pictures on the wall,</i>

17:04.023 --> 17:07.276
<i>the next mind-blowing moment
that'll have you asking...</i>

17:07.359 --> 17:08.610
What is going on here?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.613
<i>Came from Daniel Joseph's favorite,
Yale Gracey.</i>

17:11.697 --> 17:12.865
A special effects designer

17:12.948 --> 17:14.908
like Yale Gracey
would have all these heads,

17:14.992 --> 17:16.952
these busts sitting around the lab.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.581
DANIEL: <i>And one day,
one of them was sitting in reverse,</i>

17:20.664 --> 17:25.586
and he walks past it
and notices, "That face is following me."

17:25.961 --> 17:27.087
EJ: How do they do that?

17:27.171 --> 17:29.506
And that's a perfect happenstance effect.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.507
(ghost wails)

17:30.591 --> 17:35.012
NARRATOR: <i>Finally escaping the gaze
of Yale Gracey's accidental creations,</i>

17:35.095 --> 17:39.475
<i>you realize that the ride part
of the attraction hasn't even begun.</i>

17:39.558 --> 17:41.685
<i>Turns out you've just been in the line.</i>

17:41.769 --> 17:44.354
Haunted Mansion's experience in the queue

17:44.438 --> 17:47.816
gives you that sense
of foreboding and anxiety

17:47.900 --> 17:50.069
and anticipation for what
you're gonna experience on the ride.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.445
NARRATOR: <i>Speaking of which...</i>

17:51.528 --> 17:53.280
Realizing the number of people

17:53.363 --> 17:55.324
that would want to see
The Haunted Mansion...

17:55.407 --> 17:58.702
they decided to go
with a spectral carriage, so to speak.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.997
NARRATOR: <i>But guests won't be taking
the reins of this carriage.</i>

18:02.081 --> 18:05.709
PAUL: <i>Do not pull down
on the safety bar, please.</i>

18:05.793 --> 18:08.295
<i>I will lower it for you.</i>

18:08.378 --> 18:12.174
You're used to being the one in control.
Now the doom buggy's in control.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.510
NARRATOR:
<i>That's right, doom buggy, with an "M".</i>

18:14.593 --> 18:16.386
Affectionately known as "doom buggies".

18:16.470 --> 18:17.679
NARRATOR: <i>Well, affections aside,</i>

18:17.763 --> 18:20.933
<i>these doom buggies
are engineering marvels.</i>

18:21.016 --> 18:24.520
You have multiple rails, designing the
different rotation of all the vehicles,

18:24.603 --> 18:26.688
<i>a lot of vehicles
that are all strung together...</i>

18:26.772 --> 18:28.482
You have to drive all the vehicles

18:28.565 --> 18:31.485
through a very large layout,
up and down hills.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.987
NARRATOR: <i>Up and down hills?
What sort of house had they built?</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:35.948
So it was extremely complicated.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.242
NARRATOR: <i>Well, in the same way
that New Orleans Square</i>

18:38.325 --> 18:39.660
<i>isn't actually a square,</i>

18:39.743 --> 18:44.164
<i>it turns out that The Haunted Mansion
isn't actually a mansion, either.</i>

18:44.248 --> 18:47.251
<i>In fact, it's really
more of a haunted facade.</i>

18:47.334 --> 18:50.712
<i>Because, aside from the stretching room
where the tour begins,</i>

18:50.796 --> 18:53.757
<i>the attraction
isn't even inside this building.</i>

18:53.841 --> 18:56.426
<i>You're actually travelling
through a tunnel</i>

18:56.510 --> 18:59.721
<i>dug under the house,
under the railroad tracks,</i>

18:59.805 --> 19:01.390
<i>outside of the park border,</i>

19:01.473 --> 19:04.643
<i>and finally,
up into a massively, monstrous...</i>

19:04.726 --> 19:06.395
<i>mega-mansion!</i>

19:06.478 --> 19:07.688
<i>And this is where...</i>

19:07.771 --> 19:10.065
You head off into the mansion itself.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.485
NARRATOR: <i>Riding your doom buggy
deeper into the mansion,</i>

19:13.569 --> 19:17.322
<i>it's worth noting that
for all the promises of ghosts,</i>

19:17.406 --> 19:19.658
<i>at this point,
we haven't actually seen one.</i>

19:19.741 --> 19:22.828
<i>So to conjure up
what we came for, we enter...</i>

19:22.911 --> 19:23.996
The Séance Room.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.123
LEOTA:
<i>Awaken the spirits with your tambourine.</i>

19:26.206 --> 19:29.334
And in this crystal ball,
a lady's head appears.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.963
Send us a message from somewhere beyond.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.924
NARRATOR:
<i>Not just any lady. This is Madame Leota.</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:40.929
Madame Leota is our resident medium
here at The Haunted Mansion.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.557
NARRATOR: <i>But also
a resident Imagineer named...</i>

19:43.640 --> 19:48.270
Leota Toombs, a very important
designer here at The Mansion.

19:48.353 --> 19:52.065
Goblins and ghoulies
from last Halloween...

19:52.149 --> 19:54.026
We had problems with filming it

19:54.109 --> 19:56.653
<i>because the head had
to be held very still.</i>

19:56.737 --> 19:58.780
XAVIER: <i>And we finally fixed up
a brace for her.</i>

19:58.864 --> 20:01.575
In fact, we nailed her down
so she couldn't do anything

20:01.658 --> 20:03.535
but do her incantations.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.246
NARRATOR: <i>But Leota Toombs
wasn't just an Imagineer</i>

20:06.330 --> 20:07.873
<i>or a floating head.</i>

20:07.956 --> 20:11.418
<i>She was also a mother
who raised another Imagineer.</i>

20:11.501 --> 20:13.837
When I go through there,
when my kids were little

20:13.921 --> 20:16.548
and I'd say,
"There's Grandma. Wave to Grandma."

20:16.632 --> 20:18.675
(Kim chuckles)
<i>I'd hear people behind me go,</i>

20:18.759 --> 20:22.346
"What a weirdo, telling her kids
that Grandma's in The Haunted Mansion."

20:22.429 --> 20:24.348
NARRATOR:
<i>But Grandma was working overtime.</i>

20:24.431 --> 20:25.807
She's summoning the spirits.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.643
NARRATOR: <i>And you can't help but think...</i>

20:27.726 --> 20:29.311
Oh, this makes me feel creepy all over!

20:29.394 --> 20:31.230
<i>...that Walt's original vision...</i>

20:31.313 --> 20:32.397
People like to be scared.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.150
<i>...had won out, especially because...</i>

20:35.234 --> 20:37.736
This is where we see
the ghosts for the first time.

20:37.819 --> 20:42.199
NARRATOR: <i>But not just one or two.
This is the grand ballroom,</i>

20:42.282 --> 20:43.825
<i>home to a dozen ghosts!</i>

20:43.909 --> 20:48.830
Seeing real ghosts dancing
in the ballroom scene blew my mind.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.166
NARRATOR: <i>This incredible scene utilized</i>

20:51.250 --> 20:55.003
<i>every state-of-the-art trick Disney
had at their disposal,</i>

20:55.087 --> 20:57.297
<i>as well as a really old one.</i>

20:57.381 --> 21:00.217
Well, that was an old magician's technique
called "Pepper's Ghost."

21:00.300 --> 21:02.177
-What do you see?
-An organ.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.303
-WALT: Yes.
-JULIE: A ghost.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.930
A ghost is playing, sure.

21:05.013 --> 21:09.017
It was invented by a guy named Pepper
back in the 1800s.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.311
NARRATOR:
<i>And what John Henry Pepper invented</i>

21:11.395 --> 21:12.688
<i>was a clever technique</i>

21:12.771 --> 21:16.566
<i>to conjure spooks and specters
to the stage for live audiences.</i>

21:16.650 --> 21:18.277
If you've ever looked out of a window

21:18.360 --> 21:20.779
<i>and think you've seen something
outside the window</i>

21:20.862 --> 21:22.864
<i>but it's actually a reflection
from the window</i>

21:22.948 --> 21:24.574
<i>of something in the house,</i>

21:24.658 --> 21:26.576
that's how Pepper's Ghost can work.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.955
So in The Haunted Mansion,
when you see those ghosts,

21:30.038 --> 21:34.042
<i>you're actually seeing a reflection
of real Animatronic dancers.</i>

21:34.126 --> 21:37.462
NARRATOR: <i>A deceptively simple,
yet effective illusion.</i>

21:38.255 --> 21:39.923
<i>But they wouldn't all be so easy.</i>

21:40.007 --> 21:42.301
<i>As Yale Gracey would soon discover</i>

21:42.384 --> 21:46.013
<i>while building the mansion
attic spotlight spook known as...</i>

21:46.096 --> 21:48.140
-(laughs)
<i>-...the Hatbox Ghost,</i>

21:48.223 --> 21:51.393
<i>who was brought to life
by an equally simple optical illusion.</i>

21:51.893 --> 21:52.978
<i>At least, in theory.</i>

21:53.061 --> 21:56.231
When the light was turned off the face,
it would disappear.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.566
And at the same time,

21:57.649 --> 22:00.736
a light would shine on the inside
of this translucent hatbox.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.280
VICTORIA: <i>And it was, "Ooh, spooky ghost.</i>

22:03.363 --> 22:05.991
His face is on his head,
and then his face is in this box."

22:06.450 --> 22:08.327
-NARRATOR: <i>But...</i>
-It never quite worked.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.078
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, to be fair, it did at first.</i>

22:10.162 --> 22:11.872
The lighting conditions were different

22:11.955 --> 22:14.916
between where they had tested it
and where it was installed.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.295
And that difference in lighting condition
ruined the effect.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.547
VICTORIA: <i>You could see
both faces simultaneously.</i>

22:20.630 --> 22:24.092
NARRATOR:
<i>And Imagineers were forced to face facts.</i>

22:24.176 --> 22:28.055
The perfectionist Yale Gracey was,
he really lobbied to have that taken out

22:28.138 --> 22:29.681
because it didn't live up to his vision.

22:29.765 --> 22:34.019
NARRATOR: <i>And so, the Hatbox Ghost
was boxed up after less than a week.</i>

22:34.895 --> 22:37.022
And that adds to the mystery immensely.

22:37.105 --> 22:41.526
NARRATOR: <i>But had this beheaded boogeyman
truly been cast out for good?</i>

22:41.610 --> 22:42.778
(laughs)

22:42.861 --> 22:44.863
NARRATOR: <i>Only time will tell.</i>

22:45.530 --> 22:48.450
<i>But before you can be cast out
of the attic space,</i>

22:48.533 --> 22:51.828
<i>you'll come face to face
with the chilling bride.</i>

22:51.912 --> 22:54.081
Who is a black widow bride,

22:54.164 --> 22:57.542
and we're trying to piece together
all these different husbands

22:57.626 --> 23:00.796
<i>who seem to be somehow losing their heads
in the portraits.</i>

23:00.879 --> 23:05.217
NARRATOR: <i>And you might lose your head
when you learn that this betrothed banshee</i>

23:05.300 --> 23:08.261
<i>is a remnant of a discarded mansion story</i>

23:08.345 --> 23:11.181
<i>from the attraction's early days
of development.</i>

23:11.264 --> 23:17.729
And the story had to do with a bride
who, on her wedding day, was abandoned.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.607
And became a ghost as a result of...

23:20.690 --> 23:22.734
NARRATOR:
<i>Something too heinous to speak of!</i>

23:22.818 --> 23:23.944
(female ghost laughs)

23:24.027 --> 23:27.280
NARRATOR: <i>But lest this attic space
become too macabre,</i>

23:27.364 --> 23:28.740
<i>it's at this point that...</i>

23:28.824 --> 23:31.785
You leave the mansion and head outside.

23:31.868 --> 23:34.704
NARRATOR: <i>And that's when you get
the biggest shock of all...</i>

23:34.788 --> 23:36.164
(screams)

23:36.248 --> 23:40.168
<i>...as you're confronted
by a vast cemetery full of fun!</i>

23:40.252 --> 23:43.547
You'll see them all singing and dancing,
playing musical instruments,

23:43.630 --> 23:46.174
engaging in games, riding on bikes.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.635
NARRATOR: <i>As the song
that's been spookily guiding us</i>

23:48.718 --> 23:49.719
<i>through the attraction</i>

23:49.803 --> 23:53.515
<i>cleverly morphs into one
of the catchiest tunes at Disneyland!</i>

23:53.598 --> 23:56.810
The musical score is a sweeping
version of "Grim Grinning Ghost"

23:56.893 --> 23:58.895
that's orchestrated
in many different ways.

23:58.979 --> 24:02.524
NARRATOR: <i>An old-school Imagineer,
Xavier Atencio...</i>

24:02.607 --> 24:05.735
Was the best Mickey Mouse artist
that ever worked for Disney Studios.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.238
<i>...was relatively new to writing lyrics.</i>

24:08.321 --> 24:10.615
NARRATOR:
<i>But after his successful sea shanty work</i>

24:10.699 --> 24:12.200
<i>on Pirates of the Caribbean,</i>

24:12.284 --> 24:14.453
<i>it was a songwriter's life for him!</i>

24:14.536 --> 24:16.746
<i>Walt assigned him, late in the game,</i>

24:16.830 --> 24:19.416
<i>to pen the words and lyrics
to accompany the music</i>

24:19.499 --> 24:23.378
<i>of famed Disney composer Buddy Baker
for The Haunted Mansion theme.</i>

24:23.462 --> 24:26.465
Writing songs for rides like this,
you can't have a beginning and end.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.592
Each stanza has to have its own meaning.

24:28.675 --> 24:30.886
NARRATOR: <i>And the meaning
of this part of the attraction,</i>

24:30.969 --> 24:32.053
<i>well, that's pretty clear.</i>

24:32.137 --> 24:34.055
It is a full-fledged jamboree.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.099
<i>♪ When the crypt doors creak
And the tombstones quake ♪</i>

24:36.183 --> 24:38.977
And there's these marble busts,
but they're singing to me.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.605
NARRATOR: <i>Another one
of Yale Gracey's special tricks...</i>

24:41.688 --> 24:43.398
And they're certainly fan favorites.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.443
<i>...the singing busts utilize
clever projection.</i>

24:48.320 --> 24:50.489
<i>♪ As the moon climbs high
o'er the dead oak tree ♪</i>

24:50.572 --> 24:54.075
NARRATOR: <i>And as you stare
into the morbid face of a marble bust,</i>

24:54.534 --> 24:56.286
<i>happily singing about death...</i>

24:56.369 --> 24:59.456
<i>♪ Grim grinning ghosts
come out to socialize ♪</i>

24:59.539 --> 25:03.126
<i>...it becomes clear that your ride
is about to come to an end.</i>

25:03.210 --> 25:05.086
But before you can get off
your doom buggy,

25:05.170 --> 25:08.590
<i>you look and you see a ghost hitchhike
a ride with you along the way.</i>

25:08.673 --> 25:11.968
I think that made a very nice finish
for that attraction.

25:12.052 --> 25:15.096
There was a ghost sitting on my lap.
I'm like, that is the funniest thing ever.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.516
NARRATOR: <i>It's about then you realize...</i>

25:17.599 --> 25:19.476
The Haunted Mansion
has, like, two different vibes.

25:19.559 --> 25:20.894
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, they just did both.</i>

25:20.977 --> 25:21.937
TOM: <i>Claude had the first half.</i>

25:22.020 --> 25:24.606
NARRATOR:
<i>Yeah, the scary half, and, yeah...</i>

25:24.689 --> 25:25.774
TOM: <i>Marc had the second half.</i>

25:25.857 --> 25:27.359
-NARRATOR: <i>The funny half!</i>
-(ghost laughs)

25:27.442 --> 25:30.445
But they made
a beautiful attraction together.

25:30.529 --> 25:35.283
That has helped make The Haunted Mansion
the classic attraction that it is today.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.618
I wanna go again.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.412
NARRATOR:
<i>Word quickly spread about the pristine,</i>

25:39.496 --> 25:41.331
<i>white-columned house in Anaheim.</i>

25:41.915 --> 25:47.045
<i>And it meant that Disney was now firmly
in The Haunted Mansion building business.</i>

25:48.171 --> 25:52.509
<i>And this ghoulish construction venture
quickly expanded eastward,</i>

25:52.592 --> 25:55.762
<i>as Walt Disney World in Florida
planned to open its gates,</i>

25:55.845 --> 25:59.766
<i>along with its own Haunted Mansion,
just two years after Anaheim.</i>

25:59.849 --> 26:02.269
Even though it opened
in 1969 here at Disneyland,

26:02.352 --> 26:06.398
it was about to open in 1971
at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World.

26:06.481 --> 26:08.858
So Imagineers actually
built two of everything.

26:08.942 --> 26:12.320
<i>♪ Grim grinning ghosts
come out to socialize ♪</i>

26:12.404 --> 26:15.448
NARRATOR: <i>In an almost Pepper's Ghost
reflection of itself...</i>

26:15.532 --> 26:17.367
They built duplicates
of all the showpieces

26:17.450 --> 26:19.953
as they were going through the shops
and stored in a warehouse.

26:20.036 --> 26:23.957
<i>...this clever planning ensured
that the Florida ghosts could take up</i>

26:24.040 --> 26:27.210
<i>residence inside their mansion
as soon as it was ready.</i>

26:27.294 --> 26:28.920
NARRATOR: <i>But when it came to the outside?</i>

26:29.004 --> 26:31.965
<i>Well, that's where the Imagineers
stopped seeing double.</i>

26:32.048 --> 26:34.092
'Cause we didn't have
a New Orleans Square.

26:34.175 --> 26:35.510
We had Liberty Square.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.096
NARRATOR:
<i>So, to better reflect the location...</i>

26:38.179 --> 26:40.849
We were solidly placed
on the Eastern Seaboard.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.018
<i>...and time period, they went with...</i>

26:43.101 --> 26:46.521
Hudson River Dutch Gothic mansion
sitting up on the hill,

26:46.855 --> 26:51.359
playing into all the ghost stories
that that thing provided for us.

26:51.443 --> 26:55.155
NARRATOR: <i>And they had plans to take
this Haunted Mansion to the next level,</i>

26:55.238 --> 26:57.240
<i>from a practical point of view at least.</i>

26:57.324 --> 27:00.160
Because of the water table here
in Florida,

27:00.243 --> 27:02.454
everything is sitting up higher.

27:02.537 --> 27:04.664
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, well, no Stretch Room required.</i>

27:04.748 --> 27:08.335
The Stretch Room was so popular out there,
they wanted to replicate that here, so...

27:08.752 --> 27:11.504
hence, we still have a Stretch Room,
but it stretches up,

27:11.588 --> 27:13.173
instead of pulling us down.

27:13.256 --> 27:16.217
NARRATOR: <i>Along with several other
relatively subtle differences,</i>

27:16.301 --> 27:20.764
<i>The Haunted Mansion in Walt Disney World
was also a screaming success.</i>

27:20.847 --> 27:23.975
<i>And throughout the '70s,
the attraction was becoming...</i>

27:24.059 --> 27:27.103
It was one of those sacred shows,
you just don't change it that much.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.481
NARRATOR: <i>Well, the same can't be said
for the decades.</i>

27:29.981 --> 27:33.860
<i>In the early '80s,
plans for Tokyo Disneyland emerged.</i>

27:34.444 --> 27:39.699
<i>And with it, new opportunities
to update Haunted Mansion... or not.</i>

27:39.783 --> 27:42.118
The Haunted Mansion in Tokyo

27:42.202 --> 27:46.081
<i>is a lift of Walt Disney World's
Haunted Mansion.</i>

27:46.164 --> 27:51.252
The only difference is that
it's in a different land.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.797
-NARRATOR: <i>Which is understandable.</i>
-(screams)

27:53.880 --> 27:57.884
<i>With Tokyo Disneyland not having
a New Orleans Square like Anaheim</i>

27:57.967 --> 28:00.220
<i>or a Liberty Square like Florida,</i>

28:00.303 --> 28:03.473
<i>it made perfect sense
to put their Haunted Mansion in...</i>

28:03.556 --> 28:04.683
Fantasyland.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.686
Right next to Small World.
(laughs)

28:07.769 --> 28:09.896
DANIEL JUE:
<i>And right in the front of Dumbo.</i>

28:10.647 --> 28:13.858
<i>So it fit well in that location</i>

28:13.942 --> 28:17.654
is the only reason
why I think it would go there.

28:17.737 --> 28:18.947
DAVE: Each one is different.

28:19.030 --> 28:23.410
You have to think about where it's going
and how it needs to be tweaked.

28:23.493 --> 28:29.541
NARRATOR: <i>Well, when Disneyland Paris
opened as Eurodisney Resort in 1992,</i>

28:29.624 --> 28:33.044
<i>even more tweaking was necessary.
But this time...</i>

28:33.461 --> 28:35.922
The French and the Europeans, you know,

28:36.005 --> 28:37.882
they're used to walking around Paris

28:37.966 --> 28:41.636
<i>and seeing all those rich, rich, rich
detail and history.</i>

28:41.720 --> 28:45.473
NARRATOR: <i>And let's be honest,
it's hard to compete with the catacombs.</i>

28:45.557 --> 28:49.602
<i>That's a wall made out of human bones,
in case you're wondering.</i>

28:49.686 --> 28:52.814
<i>Which Disneyland Paris cast member
Pascale Kaced</i>

28:52.897 --> 28:55.275
<i>doesn't find shocking in the least,
because...</i>

28:55.400 --> 28:58.278
(in French)

28:58.361 --> 28:59.696
NARRATOR: <i>Ah! Rolly was right!</i>

28:59.779 --> 29:01.239
People like to be scared.

29:01.322 --> 29:02.532
NARRATOR: <i>Especially the French, it seems!</i>

29:02.615 --> 29:03.616
(woman shrieks)

29:03.700 --> 29:06.911
NARRATOR: <i>And clearly,
The Mansion's funny-slash-scary combo</i>

29:06.995 --> 29:08.455
<i>wasn't going to cut it this time.</i>

29:08.538 --> 29:11.082
<i>But, in a surprising twist...</i>

29:11.166 --> 29:12.459
-Hey...
-GREG: <i>We certainly thought that</i>

29:12.542 --> 29:15.003
the French audience
would really appreciate

29:15.086 --> 29:18.798
experiencing the Wild West environment
that they really don't get exposed to.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.759
So they put it in Frontierland.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.094
NARRATOR:
<i>Frontierland? Well, that might work.</i>

29:23.178 --> 29:25.722
All of Frontierland is a gold rush town.

29:25.805 --> 29:29.476
GARY: <i>And so, the mansion
is the estate of the gold baron</i>

29:29.559 --> 29:31.686
that has fallen into disrepair.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.687
NARRATOR: <i>Disrepair?</i>

29:32.771 --> 29:35.523
Our Haunted Mansion is the
only one that looks abandoned.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.733
NARRATOR: <i>But what would Walt say?</i>

29:36.816 --> 29:38.568
MAN: <i>It should be neat and clean.</i>

29:38.651 --> 29:42.489
Well, because we're in Frontierland,
it could be abandoned

29:42.572 --> 29:44.741
because that went really well
with the story.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.409
NARRATOR: <i>All right. Fair enough.</i>

29:46.493 --> 29:48.745
It's really a terrific twist.

29:48.828 --> 29:51.164
There was this great earthquake
that happened.

29:51.247 --> 29:52.749
GREG: <i>And in the earthquake,</i>

29:52.832 --> 29:55.668
<i>both the proprietor
and his wife passed away.</i>

29:55.752 --> 29:58.463
NARRATOR:
<i>And did a fresh take on an old favorite</i>

29:58.546 --> 30:00.507
<i>from both Anaheim and Florida.</i>

30:00.590 --> 30:03.927
The daughter who was going to
become married soon was left

30:04.010 --> 30:07.639
<i>to roam the halls of the manor,
bemoaning the loss of her parents.</i>

30:07.722 --> 30:09.766
She, too, eventually passes away

30:09.849 --> 30:12.727
and continues to haunt the home
to this day.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.355
NARRATOR:
<i>Sounds potentially terrifying! Is it?</i>

30:15.438 --> 30:18.191
(in French)

30:36.292 --> 30:38.753
NARRATOR:
<i>And that is how the West was won!</i>

30:38.837 --> 30:40.213
<i>Western Europe anyway.</i>

30:40.296 --> 30:43.716
LANNY: <i>A lot of our work as Imagineers
is to keep the legends,</i>

30:44.175 --> 30:50.223
don't destroy the lore, but make it
better in many ways, clearer, brighter.

30:50.306 --> 30:53.184
NARRATOR: <i>And, obviously,
relevant for the specific park.</i>

30:53.268 --> 30:54.978
And that... that's a challenge.

30:55.061 --> 30:58.106
NARRATOR:
<i>A challenge they faced yet again in 2010</i>

30:58.189 --> 31:00.942
<i>when construction began
on a haunted attraction</i>

31:01.025 --> 31:02.527
<i>for Hong Kong Disneyland.</i>

31:02.610 --> 31:06.739
The Western notion of ghosts
and how they're portrayed is different.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.534
So a completely different storyline
was written.

31:09.617 --> 31:12.704
NARRATOR:
<i>About a haunted manor with no ghosts.</i>

31:13.288 --> 31:14.998
<i>This is Mystic Manor.</i>

31:15.081 --> 31:19.544
We have the storyline of Lord Mystic,
who's created this manor house,

31:19.627 --> 31:23.172
um, to house his collection of artifacts.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.465
Hello, there.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.718
NARRATOR:
<i>But mostly, it's about a cheeky monkey.</i>

31:26.801 --> 31:29.512
ERIC: <i>We have been warned
not to touch Pandora's box.</i>

31:29.596 --> 31:32.557
And of course, Albert the monkey
opens the box

31:32.640 --> 31:34.976
and that's really
where the attraction, uh, takes off.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.896
NARRATOR: <i>But you're not taking off
in a doom buggy this time.</i>

31:37.979 --> 31:40.356
GREG:
<i>That ride system is a free-range vehicle.</i>

31:40.440 --> 31:44.152
And you're in a scene, moving around
in ways that you don't even know

31:44.235 --> 31:45.695
<i>which direction you're gonna go next.</i>

31:45.778 --> 31:47.030
ALEX: <i>With the trackless system,</i>

31:47.113 --> 31:49.741
it gives the design team
lots of flexibility.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.118
NARRATOR:
<i>Now, as for that design team, well,</i>

31:52.201 --> 31:55.121
<i>they faced many challenges
for this new attraction.</i>

31:55.204 --> 31:56.456
<i>The trickiest among them...</i>

31:56.539 --> 31:58.541
-The music dust.
-NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, music dust...</i>

31:58.625 --> 32:01.753
Comes out of the box and it starts
affecting everything that it touches

32:01.836 --> 32:03.421
as you travel through the museum.

32:03.504 --> 32:05.548
NARRATOR: <i>Gee, that sounds complicated.</i>

32:05.632 --> 32:07.050
That is a tough ask.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.303
And we worked for about a year
to figure out a way

32:10.386 --> 32:14.307
<i>to do magical floating dust
that flies around a room.</i>

32:14.390 --> 32:17.435
I think what we came up with,
and what the team came up with,

32:17.518 --> 32:18.853
is... is pretty amazing.

32:19.354 --> 32:22.732
NARRATOR: <i>So that's the "dust" part
of "musical dust" figured out.</i>

32:22.815 --> 32:24.359
<i>As for the "music" part?</i>

32:24.442 --> 32:27.362
<i>They went to someone
whose talents are renowned</i>

32:27.445 --> 32:28.738
-<i>far and wide.</i>
-...far and wide.

32:28.821 --> 32:31.783
NARRATOR: <i>Danny Elfman
who, among many other things,</i>

32:31.866 --> 32:33.159
<i>wrote the music and lyrics</i>

32:33.242 --> 32:36.079
<i>for Tim Burton's</i>
The Nightmare Before Christmas.

32:36.162 --> 32:39.082
Going to Disneyland, The Haunted Mansion
was my favorite ride.

32:39.165 --> 32:43.378
So being asked to participate
in something like this that could become,

32:43.461 --> 32:46.422
uh, iconic for several generations,

32:46.506 --> 32:48.800
I couldn't imagine not wanting to do it.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.885
Hearing that Danny Elfman
was going to do the soundtrack,

32:50.969 --> 32:52.345
uh, I was very excited about that.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.263
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, if you're excited about that...</i>

32:55.306 --> 32:58.601
<i>you should see how both Anaheim
and Tokyo Haunted Mansions</i>

32:58.685 --> 33:01.187
<i>celebrate the magic of the holiday season.</i>

33:01.270 --> 33:03.481
"The Nightmare Before Christmas" overlay,

33:03.564 --> 33:06.234
<i>it's really one of the most
popular attractions that we do.</i>

33:06.317 --> 33:09.529
GREG: <i>We had to put FastPass machines
in Japan for Haunted Mansion</i>

33:09.612 --> 33:12.991
because they were having waits
of up to four hours long

33:13.074 --> 33:15.201
<i>because of this enhancement
that we would do</i>

33:15.284 --> 33:17.161
during the Halloween
and Christmas seasons.

33:17.662 --> 33:21.040
NARRATOR: <i>The Haunted Mansion
is an iconic Disneyland attraction,</i>

33:21.124 --> 33:25.003
<i>and "The Nightmare Before Christmas"
overlay is incredibly popular.</i>

33:26.212 --> 33:29.465
<i>But there’s an understanding, and that is,</i>

33:29.549 --> 33:33.219
<i>come January, the Christmas decorations
go back in the cupboard...</i>

33:33.302 --> 33:35.346
<i>and random storage boxes.</i>

33:35.430 --> 33:36.597
MAN 4: Out! Let me out of here!

33:36.681 --> 33:40.268
NARRATOR: <i>And the house is returned
to normal for another year because...</i>

33:40.351 --> 33:45.106
If they're classic and still effective,
there's no reason at all to update it.

33:45.189 --> 33:49.986
NARRATOR: <i>An idea that, in many ways,
goes against the very promise Walt made</i>

33:50.069 --> 33:51.529
<i>when Disneyland first opened.</i>

33:51.612 --> 33:53.865
There will always be something
new and unusual.

33:53.948 --> 33:56.909
NARRATOR:
<i>And it left today's Imagineers wondering,</i>

33:56.993 --> 33:58.870
<i>what would the greats have done?</i>

33:58.953 --> 34:03.124
<i>How would Yale Gracey update
his illusions for today?</i>

34:03.207 --> 34:04.959
Or, as Walt would say, "Plussed it up."

34:05.043 --> 34:08.379
NARRATOR: <i>Would he improve things?
Create new things?</i>

34:08.463 --> 34:11.758
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if a disembodied Madame Leota

34:12.133 --> 34:17.013
<i>could fly around the Séance Room
in ways that just baffle guests?</i>

34:17.096 --> 34:20.600
You come into the scene,
you go all the way around her.

34:20.683 --> 34:22.268
DANIEL: <i>There's no chance for you to say,</i>

34:22.351 --> 34:24.979
<i>"Well, obviously, they did it this way,
'cause this was hidden."</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:27.982
No, we show you every single thing
that's up our sleeve.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.693
NARRATOR: <i>Or perhaps, finally fix things</i>

34:30.777 --> 34:33.071
<i>that never really quite worked
in the first place.</i>

34:33.154 --> 34:34.781
I kind of had the eureka moment.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.492
NARRATOR:
<i>Daniel Joseph's golden idea was...</i>

34:37.575 --> 34:41.329
Bringing back the Hatbox Ghost
to The Haunted Mansion in Anaheim.

34:41.412 --> 34:42.497
NARRATOR: <i>Good idea!</i>

34:42.580 --> 34:47.210
The Hatbox Ghost was something
that I loved since I was, like, ten.

34:47.293 --> 34:51.172
NARRATOR: <i>It was a project Daniel Joseph
seemed destined to complete,</i>

34:51.255 --> 34:54.926
<i>and the funny thing was, he already had...
in his spare time!</i>

34:55.009 --> 34:58.763
I built a mock-up prototype
of this thing in my garage.

34:58.846 --> 35:00.014
NARRATOR: <i>Just for fun.</i>

35:00.098 --> 35:02.725
I do it after work.
Sometimes I do it at lunch.

35:02.809 --> 35:06.187
NARRATOR: <i>With the utmost respect
for his idol, Yale Gracey,</i>

35:06.270 --> 35:08.022
<i>Daniel Joseph tinkered.</i>

35:08.106 --> 35:12.401
I took his original design
and concept of how to do it

35:12.485 --> 35:15.905
and pitched it to people
in the office up in Imagineering.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.240
NARRATOR: <i>And so, with...</i>

35:17.323 --> 35:18.741
Utmost secrecy...

35:18.825 --> 35:21.661
We got moved to this very dark room.

35:21.744 --> 35:24.831
NARRATOR: <i>And under the expert eye
of Daniel Joseph...</i>

35:24.914 --> 35:26.165
"Now, watch this."

35:29.293 --> 35:33.131
VICTORIA: <i>Even though I knew
how the mechanism was supposed to work...</i>

35:34.340 --> 35:35.508
(laughs)

35:35.591 --> 35:36.759
...it completely blew me away.

35:36.843 --> 35:40.596
NARRATOR: <i>Thanks to the admiration
and dedication of Daniel Joseph...</i>

35:40.680 --> 35:42.640
Daniel Joseph is a wizard.

35:42.723 --> 35:46.185
<i>...the Hatbox Ghost's status
as the great, unfinished work</i>

35:46.269 --> 35:50.606
<i>of the master Imagineer Yale Gracey
was now complete.</i>

35:50.690 --> 35:53.025
Daniel understands
the simplicity of things

35:53.109 --> 35:54.610
and how simple effects are created,

35:54.694 --> 35:59.448
and I know his mentor/idol, Yale Gracey
was of the same meld.

35:59.532 --> 36:03.578
NARRATOR: <i>In a passing of the torch,
or perhaps moving of the head...</i>

36:04.036 --> 36:09.292
<i>Daniel Joseph now continues the work
of the great, enigmatic man.</i>

36:09.375 --> 36:12.628
DANIEL: <i>Yale Gracey, I feel like,
is as much of a myth</i>

36:12.712 --> 36:15.047
within the Walt Disney Company,
almost, as the Hatbox Ghost

36:15.131 --> 36:17.425
because he was a man of few words,

36:17.508 --> 36:21.554
<i>uh, extremely humble and passed away
at a very young age.</i>

36:21.637 --> 36:24.390
NARRATOR: <i>We'll never know
what Yale himself would've thought, but...</i>

36:24.473 --> 36:28.227
I think Yale, I'd like to say,
he would dig it.

36:28.769 --> 36:32.023
NARRATOR: <i>Well, Daniel Joseph,
hats off to you.</i>

36:32.106 --> 36:36.569
<i>And to all the Imagineers
who played their part in coming together</i>

36:36.652 --> 36:41.282
<i>to create one of the greatest
theme park attractions of all time.</i>

36:41.365 --> 36:46.204
The Haunted Mansion... is amazing
for the attraction that it is,

36:46.287 --> 36:48.539
given the number of hands
that were competing

36:48.623 --> 36:50.041
for creative leadership on it.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.292
NARRATOR: <i>Yale Gracey...</i>

36:51.375 --> 36:54.629
If you take all the illusions
out of The Haunted Mansion

36:54.712 --> 36:58.007
that Yale designed,
it'd be dead as a post.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.550
NARRATOR: <i>Xavier Atencio...</i>

36:59.634 --> 37:02.303
All the credit for the success
of the Haunted Mansion,

37:02.386 --> 37:04.055
story-wise, should go to X.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.181
NARRATOR: <i>Marc Davis...</i>

37:05.264 --> 37:08.684
So many of his amazing gags
are seen throughout The Mansion.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.520
<i>...and his creative opposite,
Claude Coats.</i>

37:11.604 --> 37:13.981
ORLANDO: <i>Claude was a great artist.
He was very opinionated.</i>

37:14.065 --> 37:17.026
He knew what he had to do,
but he would always listen.

37:17.109 --> 37:18.152
He was amazing.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.405
NARRATOR: <i>And of course,
the prankster himself, Rolly Crump.</i>

37:21.489 --> 37:23.991
Rolly Crump is definitely a fan favorite.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.034
Roland.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.745
He gave us that twisted vibe
for The Haunted Mansion.

37:27.828 --> 37:31.582
When you see a Rolly Crump drawing,
you know that it's a Rolly Crump drawing.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.627
We're gonna have man-eating plants
and we're gonna have a coffin clock here

37:34.710 --> 37:36.212
that we're working on right now.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.713
Museum of the Weird.

37:37.797 --> 37:42.176
NARRATOR: <i>And although Rolly's Museum
of the Weird never actually happened...</i>

37:42.260 --> 37:44.804
His style was able
to contribute to that...

37:44.887 --> 37:46.597
that weird vibe of The Haunted Mansion.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.516
YOUNG ROLLY: These are just things
I collected from all over the world.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.184
Just the weirdest things we could find.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.645
He was Tim Burton before Tim Burton,
if you will.

37:52.728 --> 37:55.690
NARRATOR: <i>Rolly's unique perspective
led to a long career</i>

37:55.773 --> 37:59.610
<i>as one of the premiere theme park
attraction artists in the world.</i>

37:59.694 --> 38:01.529
DORIS: <i>He was such a great boss,</i>

38:01.612 --> 38:06.325
because if I would be off track,
he wouldn't say, "Well, that was dumb."

38:06.409 --> 38:09.036
He would just say, "Oh, okay,
I didn't think of it that way."

38:09.120 --> 38:14.333
Because I think Walt did that for him,
so he kind of passed that on.

38:15.668 --> 38:20.381
We were a family. And after Walt
had passed away, his brother, Roy,

38:20.464 --> 38:22.550
who I had never met,
came up to me, he said,

38:22.633 --> 38:24.468
"Are you Rolly Crump?"
And I said, "Yes, I am."

38:24.552 --> 38:27.471
He said, "I want you to know
my brother used to talk about you."

38:31.976 --> 38:35.062
That's a part... you know. It's hard.
(whimpers)

38:37.023 --> 38:40.776
That's what kind of a guy he was.
He was a sweetheart.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.362
We're also collecting real ghosts
to bring in here.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.572
You believe in ghosts, don't you, Julie?

38:44.655 --> 38:47.575
NARRATOR: <i>As one of the first
major attractions completed </i>

38:47.658 --> 38:48.868
<i>after Walt's death,</i>

38:48.951 --> 38:54.123
<i>the success that these Imagineers
had proved that Disneyland could endure</i>

38:54.206 --> 38:56.125
<i>with Walt's vision at its heart,</i>

38:56.751 --> 38:58.169
-<i>whether it was...
</i>-Funny.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.295
<i>-...or...</i>
-Scary.

38:59.378 --> 39:01.297
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

39:01.380 --> 39:02.673
(screams)

39:02.757 --> 39:04.133
(laughs)

39:04.216 --> 39:07.261
NARRATOR: <i>Whatever word best describes
Haunted Mansion for you...</i>

39:07.345 --> 39:08.429
Dark and sinister.

39:08.512 --> 39:09.597
The funniest thing ever.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.349
NARRATOR: <i>Yep, all those things!</i>

39:11.432 --> 39:14.852
<i>There is no doubt that,
either through sheer luck</i>

39:14.935 --> 39:18.439
<i>or a team of individuals
at the top of their game...</i>

39:18.522 --> 39:22.693
It's pretty hard to look at an old movie
from 50 years ago and say,

39:22.777 --> 39:24.320
<i>"I don't know how they did that."</i>

39:24.403 --> 39:26.864
DANIEL: <i>That's what The Mansion
is still doing today.</i>

39:26.947 --> 39:29.075
NARRATOR:
<i>And this Imagineering masterpiece</i>

39:29.158 --> 39:31.744
<i>has been not just a fan favorite,</i>

39:31.827 --> 39:35.915
<i>but an inspiration to all those
who know what's behind the curtain.</i>

39:35.998 --> 39:39.085
And when I'm down at any of our parks,
if I have a break,

39:39.168 --> 39:41.087
I wanna go to Haunted Mansion
and ride Haunted Mansion.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.129
I still love it.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.925
It's still just as magical
as the first time I rode it. I love it.

39:46.008 --> 39:49.762
NARRATOR: <i>Be it the original
or any of the mansions around the world,</i>

39:49.845 --> 39:53.015
<i>The Haunted Mansion is,
without question...</i>

39:53.099 --> 39:54.266
It's magic.

39:54.350 --> 39:58.729
GHOST: <i>Beware of hitchhiking ghosts.</i>
(laughs)

39:58.813 --> 40:05.319
NARRATOR: <i>And maybe magic is exactly
how Walt wanted it in the first place.</i>

40:05.820 --> 40:07.822
(laughs)

40:09.615 --> 40:11.617
(spooky music)
