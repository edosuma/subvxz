08:26.901 --> 08:29.767
YOU COULDN'T JUST LET IT GO!
YOU HAD TO KNOW, HUH?!

08:29.834 --> 08:33.033
KNOW, KNOW, KNOW --
NOSY, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE!

08:33.100 --> 08:34.900
YOU'RE NOSY! YOU'RE NOSY!

08:34.967 --> 08:37.634
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
THE REST OF YOUR FACE!

08:37.701 --> 08:40.267
SAID THE STOMACH
WITH FEET.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.234
OH...OH,
THAT'S VERY FUNNY, CHERYL.

08:42.299 --> 08:44.868
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
BECAUSE NOW THE PARTY'S OVER.

08:44.934 --> 08:46.634
IT'S BLOWN,
IT'S CANCELED.

08:46.701 --> 08:48.067
NO, NO, HONEY,
HONEY, HONEY.
NO!

08:48.133 --> 08:49.934
HONEY, I CAN ACT
SURPRISED! LOOK!

08:50.000 --> 08:52.200
OHH!
OH, THAT'S AWFUL!

08:52.267 --> 08:53.367
AWFUL!

08:53.434 --> 08:54.434
HEY, HONEY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

08:54.501 --> 08:55.667
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
FIND OUT ANYWAY,

08:55.734 --> 08:56.767
I MIGHT AS WELL TELL YOU.

08:56.834 --> 08:58.267
I'M GOING TO THE KITCHEN.

08:58.334 --> 09:00.734
HONEY, HONEY.
OH, SWEETHEART,
COME HERE.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.067
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

09:02.133 --> 09:04.834
I WANNA DO
SOMETHING.
WHAT CAN I DO?

09:04.901 --> 09:06.968
IT'S TOO LATE.
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

09:07.033 --> 09:08.901
OH, COME ON.
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:08.968 --> 09:10.534
WE'LL HAVE A PARTY
JUST FOR US.

09:10.601 --> 09:12.267
I'LL DO EVERYTHING.
I'LL MAKE YOU A CAKE.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.701
OHH, I DON'T KNOW.

09:14.767 --> 09:17.200
WHAT KIND OF CAKE
DO YOU WANT?

09:17.267 --> 09:19.133
I DON'T KNOW.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.167
HOW ABOUT A CAKE LIKE THE ONE
WE HAD AT OUR WEDDING?

09:22.234 --> 09:24.601
A WEDDING CAKE?

09:24.667 --> 09:27.033
HONEY, THAT'S GOT,
LIKE, SIX TIERS!

09:27.100 --> 09:28.200
I'D HAVE TO
START BAKING NOW.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.667
WELL, CHERYL,
YOU REALLY MESSED UP.

09:30.734 --> 09:32.367
FINE.

09:32.434 --> 09:33.567
AND A MOON BOUNCE.

09:33.634 --> 09:35.334
YEAH, RIGHT,
YOU'RE GONNA
BOUNCE UP AND DOWN

09:35.400 --> 09:36.501
IN A MOON BOUNCE.

09:36.567 --> 09:38.534
NO...

09:38.601 --> 09:39.868
 YOU ARE.

09:42.467 --> 09:44.033
OKAY, CHERYL,
MAYBE I WAS WRONG

09:44.100 --> 09:46.334
ABOUT THAT SURPRISE FACE
YOU DID.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.434
DO IT AGAIN.

09:47.501 --> 09:49.467
OKAY. AHHHH!

09:50.601 --> 09:52.734
THAT IS REALLY AWFUL.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.234
ONLY JIM WOULD MISS
HIS OWN WIFE'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.067
YOU SURE HE KNOWS
THE ADDRESS?

10:07.133 --> 10:09.067
DANA, HE HAD
A PLUMBING EMERGENCY.

10:09.133 --> 10:11.167
THIS IS WHAT IT'S
LIKE BEING MARRIED
TO A CONTRACTOR.

10:11.234 --> 10:12.801
YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE BEING
MARRIED TO A DOCTOR.

10:12.868 --> 10:16.167
YEAH, A DOCTOR
WHO CAN BURP THE ALPHABET.

10:16.234 --> 10:17.334
HOW'S YOUR HUSBAND?

10:19.601 --> 10:23.834
OH, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
OH, THE KIDS
ARE ASLEEP.

10:23.901 --> 10:26.701
I'M SO SORRY
I'M LATE.

10:26.767 --> 10:27.834
IT'S OKAY.
YOUR DINNER'S IN THE OVEN.

10:27.901 --> 10:28.968
GREAT.

10:29.033 --> 10:31.400
SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH WARMING IT UP?

10:31.467 --> 10:33.267
YOU TURN ON THE OVEN.

10:33.334 --> 10:34.767
GREAT!

10:34.834 --> 10:37.467
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.
I'LL DO IT.

10:39.067 --> 10:40.200
HERE, CHERYL.

10:40.267 --> 10:42.934
OHH!
IT'S A VEGGIE
SHOOTER-PLUS.

10:43.000 --> 10:43.934
WOW!

10:44.000 --> 10:45.801
IT'S LIKE A GUN
THAT SHOOTS COLESLAW.

10:45.868 --> 10:48.901
OH! THANK YOU.
WHOA.

10:48.968 --> 10:51.801
WHOA! WHY DO YOU
SMELL LIKE BEER
AND CIGARS?

10:54.667 --> 10:57.734
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
BOWLING SHOES?

10:57.801 --> 10:59.934
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

11:00.000 --> 11:01.300
THIS THING...

11:01.367 --> 11:03.300
THIS THING IS SO TOUGH,
YEAH.

11:03.367 --> 11:04.367
IN THE INFOMERCIAL,

11:04.434 --> 11:07.634
ROBERT URICH DRIVES
A JEEP OVER IT.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.567
WHERE DID YOU GUYS
GO, ANDY?

11:09.634 --> 11:11.234
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

11:11.300 --> 11:13.634
[PREPARES TO SPIT]
OKAY, OKAY!

11:13.701 --> 11:16.033
WE WENT BOWLING
WITH THE BEARS.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.100
WHAT?!
YEAH!

11:17.167 --> 11:18.400
BRIAN URLACHER
WAS THERE.

11:18.467 --> 11:19.701
LOOK, HE SIGNED ME.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.100
THE WHOLE TEAM
COULD'VE SIGNED THAT.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.634
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU BLEW OFF MY BIRTHDAY.

11:28.701 --> 11:31.200
HE'S GOT ONE, TOO!
HE'S GOT ONE, TOO!

11:31.267 --> 11:34.133
ANDY, I WAS ONLY GONE
FOR 30 SECONDS!

11:41.501 --> 11:43.834
YOU WANNA SEE HIM DANCE?

11:54.834 --> 11:56.501
DANA, WOULD YOU PLEASE
TAKE THE GIRLS UP

11:56.567 --> 11:57.901
AND GIVE THEM THEIR BATH
AND PUT THEM TO BED?

11:57.968 --> 11:59.100
YEAH, SURE.
THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

11:59.167 --> 12:01.200
BUT WE WANT CAKE.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.300
OH, THAT IS SO CUTE.

12:03.367 --> 12:06.434
HONEY,
CAN YOU DO THAT AGAIN?

12:06.501 --> 12:08.667
BUT WE WANT CAKE.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.834
H-H-H-HEY.
HERE. HAVE IT
IN THE TUB.

12:12.901 --> 12:15.667
YAY.

12:15.734 --> 12:19.734
SO, UH, WE CAN EAT
IN THE TUB AGAIN?

12:19.801 --> 12:21.934
THAT WAS THE MOST
INCONSIDERATE,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.868
THOUGHTLESS,
SELF-CENTERED THING
YOU HAVE EVER DONE!

12:24.934 --> 12:26.167
OHH!

12:26.234 --> 12:29.667
Video alone cannot
convey the tension
in this room.

12:29.734 --> 12:31.033
WILL YOU TURN
THAT THING OFF?!

12:31.100 --> 12:32.868
NO, NO, I WANT YOU
TO KEEP IT ON,

12:32.934 --> 12:35.501
BECAUSE I WANT HER
TO SEE THAT SHE
REALLY DOES DO THIS!

12:35.567 --> 12:37.367
OH!
CHERYL, COME ON.

12:37.434 --> 12:40.334
THIS THING TONIGHT WAS
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME CHANCE--

12:40.400 --> 12:41.901
BOWLING WITH THE BEARS!

12:41.968 --> 12:43.467
I MEAN,
IT WAS FOR CHARITY.

12:43.534 --> 12:45.767
DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT
HELPING THOSE PEOPLE?

12:45.834 --> 12:47.300
WHICH PEOPLE, JIM?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.968
THOSE PEOPLE...

12:49.033 --> 12:52.334
THAT GOT THAT PROBLEM.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.601
YOU KNOW, THEIR INSIDES
AND STUFF--WHATEVER IT IS.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.601
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

12:56.667 --> 12:57.834
NO! THIS WAS
MY BIRTHDAY!

12:57.901 --> 12:59.100
IT WAS IMPORTANT
TO ME!

12:59.167 --> 13:00.167
YEAH?!
YEAH!

13:00.234 --> 13:01.234
WELL, IF IT WASN'T
FOR YOUR IDIOT BROTHER

13:01.300 --> 13:03.300
NOT BEING ABLE TO
KEEP HIS YAP SHUT --

13:03.367 --> 13:05.367
HEY, HEY, HEY!
HE IS NOT AN IDIOT!

13:05.434 --> 13:06.400
NO?
HE'S SPINELESS!

13:06.467 --> 13:09.067
Ouch.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.467
AND HOW ABOUT YOUR SISTER?

13:11.534 --> 13:12.934
YOUR SISTER
CAN'T KEEP A SECRET!

13:13.000 --> 13:15.067
IF SHE COULD'VE KEPT
THE SECRET, YOU KNOW,

13:15.133 --> 13:17.367
YOU COULD BE ENJOYING
A SURPRISE PARTY TONIGHT

13:17.434 --> 13:19.801
IN-IN-IN PARIS!

13:19.868 --> 13:21.534
WE WERE NOT GOING
TO PARIS!

13:21.601 --> 13:23.467
WELL, YOU'LL NEVER FIND
THAT OUT NOW, WILL YOU?

13:23.534 --> 13:25.934
HEY, HEY, HEY!
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
THIS MY FAULT?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.033
WHY NOT?
I'M THE ONE

13:27.100 --> 13:28.534
WHOSE SURPRISE PARTY
GOT RUINED!
OH, YOU?!

13:28.601 --> 13:30.634
I'M THE ONE WHO HAD TO MAKE
MY OWN BIRTHDAY DINNER!

13:30.701 --> 13:33.400
OH, FINE! FINE!
FINE!

13:33.467 --> 13:37.033
I WILL NEVER, EVER
THROW ANOTHER PARTY,

13:37.100 --> 13:38.467
PLAN ANOTHER PARTY,

13:38.534 --> 13:40.767
GO TO ANOTHER
PARTY AGAIN

13:40.834 --> 13:43.067
WITH YOU, FOR YOU!

13:43.133 --> 13:44.834
WELL, THANK YOU!

13:44.901 --> 13:46.033
YOU'RE WELCOME!

13:46.100 --> 13:48.133
MAYBE I'LL ACTUALLY HAVE
A GOOD TIME ON MY BIRTHDAY!

13:48.200 --> 13:49.534
FINE!
FINE!

13:49.601 --> 13:50.567
OH, YEAH?!
YEAH.

13:50.634 --> 13:52.100
SH-UUUHH!

13:56.367 --> 13:58.734
COULD SOMEONE STORM OUT?
WE'RE DYING HERE.

13:58.801 --> 14:00.467
WITH PLEASURE!

14:02.334 --> 14:04.334
OH!

14:04.400 --> 14:06.901
OKAY, CUT. THAT'S A WRAP.
NICE WORK, PEOPLE.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.534
MOMMY?
HMM?

14:14.601 --> 14:16.167
CAN WE GO WITH YOU?

14:16.234 --> 14:17.634
OH, NO, SWEETIE.

14:17.701 --> 14:19.534
THIS IS A GROWN-UP PARTY
FOR AUNT DANA.

14:19.601 --> 14:21.300
SO I WANT YOU GIRLS
TO BE REALLY GOOD

14:21.367 --> 14:24.300
AND LISTEN TO MRS. BISHOP
WHEN SHE'S HERE, OKAY?

14:24.367 --> 14:25.467
OKAY?

14:25.534 --> 14:26.501
WE DON'T LIKE HER.

14:26.567 --> 14:29.968
SHE SMELLS
LIKE CORN.

14:30.033 --> 14:33.334
YEAH. WELL, YOUR DADDY ONLY
WANTS TO PAY $3 AN HOUR
FOR BABYSITTING.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.367
GOOD-SMELLING
BABYSITTERS COST MORE.

14:36.434 --> 14:38.667
ALL RIGHT, NOW I WANT YOU GIRLS
TO GO GET YOUR SNACK,

14:38.734 --> 14:41.501
AND I'LL PUT IN YOUR VIDEO,
OKAY? EXCELLENT.

14:41.567 --> 14:42.801
Jim: HEY, GIRLS.

14:42.868 --> 14:44.634
Both: HI, DADDY!
HOW ARE YOU, BABY?

14:44.701 --> 14:46.601
JIM, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GETTING
DRESSED.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.567
THE SITTER'S
GONNA BE HERE
IN 10 MINUTES.

14:48.634 --> 14:50.234
I'M NOT GONNA GO
TO THAT DANA THING.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.501
WHAT? WHY NOT?

14:51.567 --> 14:55.000
IT'S SUNDAY.
"ALIAS" IS ON.

14:55.067 --> 14:56.334
YOU CAN TAPE IT.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.834
AH, IT'S NOT THE SAME.

14:57.901 --> 15:01.467
I LIKE TO ENJOY IT
WITH THE REST
OF THE COUNTRY.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.434
OKAY, JIM, COME ON.

15:03.501 --> 15:05.000
DON'T--DON'T
DO THIS, PLEASE.

15:05.067 --> 15:06.367
I KNOW, I KNOW,
HONEY,

15:06.434 --> 15:08.167
WE'RE IN A LITTLE BIT
OF A THING RIGHT NOW,

15:08.234 --> 15:11.167
BUT-BUT...
BUT WE CAN'T CANCEL.

15:11.234 --> 15:13.400
DANA IS FAMILY,
AND WE PROMISED
WE'D GO.

15:13.467 --> 15:14.934
NO, HONEY, YOU PROMISED.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.167
SHE'S YOUR FAMILY.

15:17.234 --> 15:19.534
OH, COME ON.

15:19.601 --> 15:21.934
OH, COME ON, CHERYL.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.267
DANA DOESN'T CARE
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

15:24.334 --> 15:26.901
YOU KNOW, WHY SHOULD I CARE
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO HER?

15:26.968 --> 15:30.734
BECAUSE IT'S
IMPORTANT TO ME,
AND I'M YOUR WIFE.

15:33.234 --> 15:35.400
I'M NOT MAKING
THE CONNECTION.

15:37.634 --> 15:38.868
FINE.

15:38.934 --> 15:41.300
CANCEL THE SITTER
AND STAY HOME
WITH THE KIDS.

15:41.367 --> 15:43.334
WELL, I LOVE STAYING HOME
WITH THE KIDS,

15:43.400 --> 15:45.734
BUT WHY CANCEL THE SITTER?

15:45.801 --> 15:49.000
OKAY. YOU KNOW,
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU DO.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.934
I AM GONNA GO OUT
AND HAVE FUN.

15:51.033 --> 15:55.534
I AM GOING TO EAT
AND DRINK AND PARTY
AND FLIRT

15:55.601 --> 15:56.834
BECAUSE
I JUST TURNED 25,

15:56.901 --> 15:59.434
AND I AM GONNA ACT
LIKE IT.

15:59.501 --> 16:03.267
HEY, I GOT WEDDING CAKE,
"ALIAS," AND MRS. BISHOP.

16:03.334 --> 16:05.767
THE NIGHT BELONGS
TO ME, BABY.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.234
UH, EXCUSE ME.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.367
YEAH?

16:20.434 --> 16:22.400
UM, I'M SUPPOSED
TO MEET A BIG GROUP HERE

16:22.467 --> 16:24.000
FOR A PARTY FOR MY SISTER.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.767
IS THIS ORIGINAL EDDIE'S
STEAK HOUSE?

16:25.834 --> 16:27.834
YES, BUT IT'S THE OTHER
ORIGINAL EDDIE'S.

16:27.901 --> 16:29.701
THE ORIGINAL
ORIGINAL EDDIE'S--

16:29.767 --> 16:31.501
WAY OVER
ON THE WEST SIDE.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.601
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

16:33.667 --> 16:34.767
IS THE KITCHEN STILL OPEN?

16:34.834 --> 16:36.701
YES, IT IS.
ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME A SCOTCH.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.033
OHH.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.934
"DEAR CHERYL,
TOOK YOUR LAST $20.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.968
"NEEDED LOTTERY TICKETS.
FEELING LUCKY.

16:47.033 --> 16:48.901
LOVE, JIM."

16:48.968 --> 16:50.601
THAT IS SO GREAT.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.467
I DON'T EVEN HAVE CASH
TO PAY FOR MY DRINK.

16:52.534 --> 16:53.634
I'M IN THE WRONG PLACE.

16:53.701 --> 16:56.868
YOU KNOW, I HAVE JUST
MESSED EVERYTHING UP.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.701
I'M FIGHTING
WITH MY HUSBAND.

16:58.767 --> 17:02.267
I ALMOST SPIT
ON MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER.

17:02.334 --> 17:04.666
AND I ATE, LIKE,
HALF A WEDDING CAKE.

17:04.733 --> 17:08.767
I MEAN, THIS HAS JUST BEEN
A HORRIBLE BIRTHDAY WEEKEND.

17:08.834 --> 17:11.000
I HOPE 26 IS BETTER.

17:11.067 --> 17:12.501
YEAH.

17:12.567 --> 17:14.767
YOU'RE 25?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.133
YES, SHE IS.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.400
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!

17:21.901 --> 17:24.099
GOTCHA. GOTCHA, BABY.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.267
GOTCHA, GOTCHA, GOTCHA.
I'M THE MASTER!

17:26.334 --> 17:28.000
OH, MY GOD!
A SURPRISE PARTY?

17:28.067 --> 17:29.334
Jim: UH-HUH.
OHH...

17:29.400 --> 17:31.934
I WAS SO MAD!

17:32.033 --> 17:33.334
YEAH?

17:33.400 --> 17:36.267
[CRYING]
AND NOW I'M SO HAPPY!

17:36.334 --> 17:38.501
AND YOU!
I HATED YOU!

17:38.567 --> 17:40.200

17:49.667 --> 17:51.501
WE FOOLED MOMMY.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.434
YES, YOU DID.

17:55.734 --> 17:58.767
WAIT, SO ALL THIS HORRIBLE,
SELFISH BEHAVIOR

17:58.834 --> 18:00.467
WAS JUST AN ACT?

18:00.534 --> 18:01.701
YEAH, YEAH,
THE WHOLE THING--

18:01.767 --> 18:02.834
THE ARGUMENT
WITH DANA,

18:02.901 --> 18:04.901
AND ANDY
SPILLING THE BEANS.
THE WHOLE THING.

18:04.968 --> 18:06.567
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR PROMOTION?

18:06.634 --> 18:08.834
FAKE. I'M TERRIBLE AT MY JOB.
ISN'T IT GREAT?

18:08.901 --> 18:10.767
OHH, HONEY!

18:10.834 --> 18:12.901
SEE, CHERYL,
YOU'RE WAY
TOO SMART.

18:12.968 --> 18:15.334
SO IN ORDER TO KEEP
YOU OFF BALANCE,

18:15.400 --> 18:17.334
I HAD TO CONSTANTLY
ANNOY YOU.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.801
YOU'VE BEEN PLANNING
THIS SINCE THE DAY
WE GOT MARRIED?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.734
HEY, WHAT ABOUT BOWLING
WITH THE BEARS?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.767
OH, THAT WAS ALL
PART OF THE PLAN,

18:28.834 --> 18:30.367
RIGHT, MR. URLACHER?

18:30.434 --> 18:31.868
HELLO.

18:31.934 --> 18:33.033
HI.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.367
IT'S TRUE.
THE WHOLE RUSE WAS

18:34.434 --> 18:36.567
A DELICIOUS EXERCISE
IN DECEPTION.

18:38.267 --> 18:40.868
NOW, WHERE'S THE SICK KID
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET?

18:40.934 --> 18:43.367
UH, ANDY, THE--
THE SICK KID...

18:43.434 --> 18:46.334

LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

HEY.

19:01.534 --> 19:02.901
I WANT YOU

19:02.968 --> 19:05.133

19:05.200 --> 19:06.767

BEING SELFISH

19:06.834 --> 19:08.601
OR DUMB
OR ANNOYING...

19:08.667 --> 19:09.767
TAKE A MOMENT
TO THINK,

19:09.834 --> 19:12.300
"IS JIM DOING
THIS FOR ME?"

19:12.367 --> 19:14.567
HERE, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

19:14.634 --> 19:16.367

PAID FOR THIS, RIGHT?

19:40.100 --> 19:43.367
