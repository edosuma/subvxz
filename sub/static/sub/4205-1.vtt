04:06.800 --> 04:09.715
Wildfire, you either walk
into that other corral,

04:09.800 --> 04:13.213
or I'm gonna shoot ya
and drag your carcass in there.

04:13.300 --> 04:16.832
Come on, Wildfire.
Come on, boy.

04:16.925 --> 04:20.041
Let's go meet Susie now.
You'll like her.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.041
You two
gotta get together.

04:24.842 --> 04:27.591
Gotcha!
Whoa, whoa!

04:27.676 --> 04:31.373
Whoa, boy, whoa!
Whoa!

04:31.468 --> 04:33.375
Damn it.

04:41.218 --> 04:46.006
You and Susie are gonna make
some little birds, or I'm gonna
take some barbecue sauce to ya!

05:12.678 --> 05:15.001
Earl Basset, right?

05:15.094 --> 05:18.176
<i>I told you</i>
<i>that's the other one.</i>

05:31.095 --> 05:34.010
Señor Basset.

05:36.387 --> 05:40.546
<i>This is beautiful country,</i>
<i>but very isolated.</i>

05:40.637 --> 05:44.050
<i>I had great difficulty</i>
<i>finding you,</i>
<i>but I'm glad I did.</i>

05:44.137 --> 05:48.178
<i>You see, we have had to</i>
<i>close down one of Mexico's</i>
<i>biggest oil fields.</i>

05:48.262 --> 05:51.095
<i>Several workers</i>
<i>have been killed.</i>

05:51.179 --> 05:54.379
Ah, we have
now determined that...

05:54.471 --> 05:56.711
the men were killed by...

05:56.804 --> 06:00.668
certain large
underground animals.

06:04.305 --> 06:06.212
Graboids.

06:06.305 --> 06:10.512
Ah! I told you that's
what they named 'em.
Excuse me.

06:12.055 --> 06:14.804
You mean...
there's more of them?

06:14.888 --> 06:18.752
Yes. The company is facing
very expensive delays.

06:18.847 --> 06:22.757
<i>But more importantly,</i>
<i>there are many isolated people</i>
<i>who live in the region.</i>

06:22.847 --> 06:24.754
Many lives are in danger.

06:24.847 --> 06:29.172
<i>We need someone, an expert,</i>
<i>to eliminate these creatures.</i>

06:31.764 --> 06:36.386
- You want somebody
to go graboid hunting?
<i>- Sí.</i>

06:40.389 --> 06:43.636
Ah, señor,
please, please!

06:43.723 --> 06:46.390
<i>We've already spoken</i>
<i>to your partner, Señor McKee.</i>

06:46.473 --> 06:48.380
H-He is unwilling
to help us.

06:48.473 --> 06:51.755
Sure, Val married a good woman.
Why would he want to die?

06:51.848 --> 06:55.759
Of course,
we are willing to pay.
They're willing to pay!

07:04.515 --> 07:06.423
'Kay.

07:06.515 --> 07:09.632
$50,000.

07:09.724 --> 07:12.473
Go... away.

07:12.557 --> 07:17.298
No, no, no. He wants to pay you
$50,000 for each graboid.

07:17.391 --> 07:19.346
Look.

07:20.558 --> 07:23.425
No way. Not for
any amount of money.

07:23.516 --> 07:26.300
But for you, getting those worms
would be a piece of cake.

07:26.391 --> 07:29.176
Who are you?
And why are you so dumb?

07:29.266 --> 07:31.387
Oh, Grady. Grady.

07:31.475 --> 07:35.551
<i>Grady Hoover. It's an honor</i>
<i>to meet you, Mr. Basset, sir.</i>
<i>I'm probably your biggest fan.</i>

07:35.641 --> 07:39.635
That Reebok commercial
with you guys runnin' through
the desert... so very cool.

07:39.725 --> 07:42.676
- You like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

07:45.059 --> 07:48.507
Listen, could I come in?
I mean, just for a second.

07:51.809 --> 07:53.716
Great.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.050
Thanks.

07:58.142 --> 08:01.674
<i>The</i> Earl Basset.
Ohh!

08:01.768 --> 08:05.098
Yep. I've read
every one of these.

08:05.184 --> 08:09.095
I got two copies of this one.
I keep one wrapped in plastic.

08:09.184 --> 08:13.095
<i>Oh, my God, you got</i>
<i>your own one of these!</i>

08:13.185 --> 08:17.676
Oh, I bet you made a fortune
off this. Quarter, quarter,
quarter, quarter.

08:17.768 --> 08:20.683
Well, somebody did.
It sure wasn't me.

08:22.143 --> 08:26.386
Well, you musta got
a percentage.

08:26.477 --> 08:28.384
I shoulda got
a lawyer.

08:28.477 --> 08:32.423
Wow. That sucks.

08:35.519 --> 08:37.924
Did he really say
$50,000?

08:38.019 --> 08:40.768
Stack of Bibles.

08:43.186 --> 08:45.141
Forget it.

08:48.769 --> 08:51.436
You boys don't know
how mean these things are.

08:51.519 --> 08:55.015
<i>Well, okay...</i>
<i>okay, but...</i>
That was my big chance.

08:55.103 --> 09:00.223
<i>Yeah, but M-Mr. Basset...</i>
You only get one of those
in life, and I blew it...

09:00.311 --> 09:03.558
on goddam Big Bird
and his scrawny girlfriend!

09:05.687 --> 09:09.052
Yeah, but <i>50,000.</i>

09:09.145 --> 09:11.053
That's what
she's doin' there.

09:11.145 --> 09:13.053
Who?

09:13.145 --> 09:17.767
Ooh.
"Miss October, 1974"?

09:17.854 --> 09:23.435
<i>Yeah, she's there to remind me</i>
<i>not to keep chasin' after things</i>
<i>I'm never gonna get.</i>

09:23.521 --> 09:25.642
But why wouldn't
you get this?

09:25.729 --> 09:29.640
Earl... Mr. Basset,
you're the expert. You guys
kicked ass with those things.

09:29.729 --> 09:32.644
And this time, you'll be
a step ahead of them.

09:32.729 --> 09:36.142
The Mexican army is willin'
to give you whatever you want.

09:36.230 --> 09:40.058
Dynamite.
Shh, whoo, wa-bam! 50 Gs!

09:47.605 --> 09:50.769
Maybe this is your
big second chance.

10:07.522 --> 10:10.437
Señor Ortega,
you've got a deal.

10:10.523 --> 10:13.141
Bravo, bravo!
And I'm
goin' with him.

10:13.231 --> 10:16.762
<i>¡Ah, muy bien, muy bien!</i>
Um, if you'll excuse me?

10:18.856 --> 10:22.304
What? Why do you think
I drove all this way?

10:22.398 --> 10:25.349
When he said he was looking
for <i>the</i> Earl Basset,

10:25.440 --> 10:28.354
I knew Opportunity
was knockin', and I was home.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.395
I don't even know you.

10:30.482 --> 10:35.269
I drive a taxi;
I live in a crappy apartment;
I watch too much TV; et cetera.

10:35.357 --> 10:40.061
Look, you're going to need
a partner. How many people
would want to do this?

10:40.149 --> 10:45.055
<i>I'll do anything you want:</i>
<i>Carry luggage, make coffee,</i>

10:45.149 --> 10:47.056
light fuses.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.804
Maybe you will
come in handy.

10:52.899 --> 10:56.845
Ha!
When they're eating you, it'll
give me a chance to get away.

11:34.609 --> 11:36.517
Uh-oh.

11:37.568 --> 11:40.898
Who gets the last soda?
One, two...

11:40.984 --> 11:44.066
What?
Scissors,
rock, paper.

11:44.151 --> 11:46.818
One, two, three!
What's this?

11:46.901 --> 11:50.267
Scissors cuts paper.
I win.

12:20.694 --> 12:22.602
Buenos días, señores.

12:22.694 --> 12:26.854
<i>¿Ustedes dos son los americanos</i>
<i>cazadores de monstruos?</i>
Um...

12:26.945 --> 12:30.689
Um... <i>Quién es...</i> uh...

12:30.778 --> 12:33.480
No, no, no, no.
<i>"¿Dónde está..."</i>
<i>Señor Ortega?</i>

12:33.570 --> 12:37.101
<i>¿Ortega? Oh, Ortega,</i>
<i>venga acá. Están aquí.</i>

12:37.195 --> 12:40.561
Welcome.
Welcome, gentlemen.
You made good time.

12:40.653 --> 12:43.224
The sooner we get here,
the sooner we can leave.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.733
- This is Pedro, the company's
chief engineer.
<i>- Mucho gusto.</i>

12:46.820 --> 12:49.522
Uh, <i>buenos días.</i>
<i>Ysu nuevo compañero,</i>
<i>el Sr. Hoover.</i>

12:49.612 --> 12:53.902
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>
<i>Buena suerte y que los monstruos</i>
<i>no los coman a ustedes.</i>

12:53.987 --> 12:57.069
Pedro.

12:57.154 --> 13:01.195
Um, I have all your
equipment over here.

13:01.279 --> 13:04.112
Oh, by the way,
I have some good news.

13:04.196 --> 13:08.521
We offer you double the price
if you are able to capture
one of the animals alive.

13:08.613 --> 13:12.310
Double?
Alive? Have you ever seen
one of these things?

13:12.405 --> 13:17.441
It is only a suggestion...
if it was possible
to capture one of them.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.942
No, you never know.
Earl, you never know.
Yes, I do.

13:21.030 --> 13:23.435
Never should have
come down here.

13:27.780 --> 13:30.695
The army has sent
everything you requested.

13:30.780 --> 13:33.186
You have asked for some...

13:33.280 --> 13:35.188
Unusual things.

13:42.156 --> 13:44.526
Earl, please
check this out.

13:44.614 --> 13:47.529
Look, this isn't
some kind of party.

13:47.614 --> 13:49.522
I know that.

13:49.614 --> 13:53.027
I just think we should show
a little enthusiasm here.

14:04.948 --> 14:07.863
Let me introduce you
to Kate Riley.
Hi.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.863
<i>She's the geologist</i>
<i>for the oil company.</i>
<i>And these are the men...</i>

14:10.949 --> 14:15.440
I know, I know.
The monster hunters. I saw you
on <i>Good Morning, America...</i>

14:15.532 --> 14:17.937
or, uh, one of those.

14:18.032 --> 14:22.108
<i>Yeah, this is, uh,</i>
the <i>Earl Basset,</i>
<i>the one and only.</i>

14:22.199 --> 14:25.814
Uh, that's right.
Nice to meet ya.

14:25.908 --> 14:29.439
- Really nice to meet you.
<i>- I'm Grady Hoover,</i>
<i>the new guy.</i>

14:29.533 --> 14:31.440
<i>Nice... hat.</i>
Thanks.

14:31.533 --> 14:33.903
I hope to hear
good news soon.

14:33.991 --> 14:38.281
<i>Miss Riley will stay in contact</i>
<i>with me. Let us know</i>
<i>anything else you need.</i>

14:38.366 --> 14:40.274
And, uh...

14:40.366 --> 14:43.151
Well, best of luck
to you, huh?

14:43.242 --> 14:45.197
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

14:47.283 --> 14:51.941
<i>So this is the place.</i>
<i>I'll show you around.</i>
<i>You thirsty or anything?</i>

14:52.034 --> 14:55.613
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I am.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.615
<i>Anyway, we've been</i>
<i>pretty nervous down here.</i>

14:58.700 --> 15:01.615
<i>Glad you guys were willin'</i>
<i>to come all this way.</i>

15:01.701 --> 15:04.533
<i>It sure is in the middle</i>
<i>of nowhere.</i>

15:04.617 --> 15:08.528
Well, of course.
Stuff like this only happens
in the middle of nowhere.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.149
- Hey, Julio.
- Hey, Kate.

15:12.243 --> 15:15.157
So?
It's all done.
They're all working.

15:15.243 --> 15:19.947
Yes, yes! Guys, this is Julio.
He's been setting up
the seismographs. Earl, Grady.

15:20.035 --> 15:22.949
Yes, I've seen you
in the magazines.

15:23.035 --> 15:25.949
Actually, I'm not
the original guy.

15:26.035 --> 15:31.320
You know, you musta made a lot
of money, huh? The royalties
on that video game alone! Ooh.

15:31.410 --> 15:35.321
<i>Julio, we should be able to get</i>
<i>an accurate count now, right?</i>

15:35.410 --> 15:38.492
<i>Yes, yes. I have a friend</i>
<i>who invested in that company.</i>

15:49.744 --> 15:51.651
Hey.

15:51.744 --> 15:54.944
Hi. Come on in.

15:55.036 --> 15:59.693
So, uh, we were gonna
look over some maps?

15:59.786 --> 16:03.117
Right. Um, coffee?

16:03.203 --> 16:05.608
Yeah, black.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.784
How were those
burritos, anyway?

16:08.870 --> 16:10.944
Um, good. Good.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.703
Yeah, sorry about that.

16:13.787 --> 16:17.199
Pretty bad, I know.
But with Cook gone,
that's best we've got.

16:19.912 --> 16:23.278
So, um... how many of you
are still workin' out here?

16:23.370 --> 16:27.281
Only the three of us.
They had to shut the whole
operation down.

16:27.371 --> 16:29.278
Six people got killed...

16:29.371 --> 16:31.278
people I knew.

16:31.371 --> 16:36.361
Hmm. Well, uh,
how come you stayed on?
Well...

16:36.454 --> 16:40.235
You're not scared?
Shit, yeah, I'm scared.

16:40.329 --> 16:42.652
But...
I'm also fascinated.

16:42.746 --> 16:44.654
It's, uh...

16:44.746 --> 16:47.780
With me, "fascinated"
usually wins.

16:47.871 --> 16:50.325
Maps.

16:50.413 --> 16:52.700
I'll get these cores out
of the way. Come on, baby.

17:09.622 --> 17:14.444
So, uh,
have the graboids come
near the refinery yet?

17:14.539 --> 17:17.786
No, they've left us alone.
They stay about 20 miles north.

17:17.873 --> 17:20.278
That's where the workers
were killed.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.778
Who named them
graboids, anyway?

17:22.873 --> 17:27.446
A... friend of ours,
Walter Chang.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.491
He named them,
then they ate him.

17:30.581 --> 17:34.492
<i>Hey, guys,</i>
<i>look what I made.</i>

17:40.165 --> 17:43.613
Just, you know,
drag it behind the truck.

17:45.957 --> 17:50.117
Make, you know,
make more noise.

17:52.207 --> 17:56.331
You see, uh,
graboids hunt by sound.

17:56.416 --> 17:59.330
I'll probably just go hook that
to the back of the truck.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.792
"Moonstros."
<i>Ah, sí.</i>

18:24.875 --> 18:27.280
<i>Mr. Hoover, come here please.</i>

18:27.375 --> 18:29.615
<i>I have the monitor working.</i>

18:29.709 --> 18:31.616
Okay.

18:31.709 --> 18:36.994
We've set up radio seismographs
all over, so the monitor will
show you where the graboids are.

18:37.084 --> 18:39.952
Cool.

18:40.042 --> 18:44.913
You know, this is none of my
business, I guess, but you guys
are going out there alone?

18:45.001 --> 18:49.954
You don't want to take with you
the whole army of Mexico?
<i>Let me explain, Julio.</i>

18:50.043 --> 18:53.206
Graboids, they got no eyes.
They hunt by sound.

18:53.293 --> 18:56.125
<i>You make a noise;</i>
<i>They're gonna come after you.</i>

18:56.210 --> 18:59.706
If we get a bunch of people
runnin' around...

18:59.793 --> 19:03.917
Graboids gonna spread out
all over the place. No,
we want 'em all to come to us.

19:05.377 --> 19:08.956
So you guys are what?
You guys are the bait?

19:10.460 --> 19:12.368
That's the plan.

19:24.794 --> 19:27.247
Okay, so, uh...

19:29.919 --> 19:32.040
<i>That's us.</i>
<i>That's our truck.</i>

19:34.378 --> 19:37.660
<i>Seems like everything's</i>
<i>workin' okay.</i>

19:37.753 --> 19:41.960
Well, sure it is, Earl.
This is a high-tech,
professional operation here.

19:42.045 --> 19:46.453
Hey, we got a good plan goin'.
Fifty thousand apiece, baby.

19:46.545 --> 19:50.870
Ho! You know, me,
I'm gonna get mine all at once,

19:50.962 --> 19:52.869
just stacked!

19:52.962 --> 19:57.086
Well, if I make any money
this time, I'll invest it...
conservatively.

19:58.879 --> 20:00.786
Hey, you shaved.

20:00.879 --> 20:06.081
What?
No, I just... I just noticed
you... you know, shaved.

20:08.046 --> 20:11.376
So what?
A man can shave, can't he?

20:13.754 --> 20:16.918
No, you're right.
She's a babe.

20:45.631 --> 20:48.119
Well,

20:48.214 --> 20:50.963
here's where they're
supposed to be.

20:51.048 --> 20:53.832
Man, look at that
country, huh?

20:53.923 --> 20:57.668
Yeah. Not a lot of rocks
and boulders out there.

20:57.756 --> 21:01.204
Not much to climb on if we
don't want to get slurped.

21:04.548 --> 21:07.215
There's mountains around.
You said they can't
get through mountains.

21:07.298 --> 21:09.917
I said they can't
go through rock.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.914
<i>These hills are alluvial.</i>

21:12.007 --> 21:15.123
Oh, "alluvial."

21:15.215 --> 21:19.339
Wait a minute, that's the little
dingleberry in the back
of your throat, right?

21:19.424 --> 21:22.338
You want to hunt graboids;
you better know geology.

21:22.424 --> 21:27.544
<i>Here, you drive. I'm keepin'</i>
<i>my eye on this... seismo-jigger.</i>

21:27.632 --> 21:29.540
Oh, good call.

21:35.133 --> 21:38.131
No offence, Earl, but you're
nervous as a chihuahua.

21:38.216 --> 21:40.420
I'm not nervous.
I'm alert.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.415
Whatever.

22:04.884 --> 22:07.668
<i>Those worms have to be deaf</i>
<i>if they don't hear us.</i>

22:07.759 --> 22:11.290
Hey, take it easy, huh?

22:14.301 --> 22:16.208
<i>Jesus, Grady.</i>
<i>We got one!</i>

22:16.301 --> 22:19.631
- It's spotted us!
It's comin' right toward us!
- Well, that's the idea.

22:19.718 --> 22:23.130
Doesn't mean I have to like it.
Now stop. Stop already!

22:32.051 --> 22:34.421
Okay, time
for the secret weapon.

22:35.760 --> 22:39.706
<i>Careful with that detonator.</i>
<i>Set it like I showed you.</i>

22:39.802 --> 22:44.258
- How dumb do you think I am?
- Catch me later on that one.

23:13.553 --> 23:17.084
- He's comin' in.
I think he's followin' it.

23:17.178 --> 23:20.093
Of course he is.

23:23.762 --> 23:28.254
I can't see it, Earl.
Earl, I can't see it!

23:28.345 --> 23:31.427
<i>Left. Left.</i>
<i>Left!</i>

23:31.512 --> 23:34.795
- Okay, okay.
<i>- Wait. Wait, there.</i>

23:41.179 --> 23:44.462
He did it. He took it.
O-Okay. Hit it! Get him!

23:44.554 --> 23:47.718
Oh, shit.
Earl, what are you doin'?
Hit it, hit it!

23:47.804 --> 23:49.878
Hit it!
Hit it, Earl!

23:52.888 --> 23:56.799
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>
<i>50 Gs, baby, 50 Gs!</i>

23:56.888 --> 24:00.585
Oh, shit!

24:00.680 --> 24:03.797
Told ya.

24:03.888 --> 24:05.844
I forgot.

24:15.514 --> 24:19.010
Yeah!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

25:03.307 --> 25:05.677
Man, this stuff
really stinks.

25:05.766 --> 25:09.262
Yeah, don't forget
to get that antenna too.

25:13.349 --> 25:17.592
<i>Uno de los mejores éxitos</i>
<i>de Travis Tritt.</i>

25:17.683 --> 25:23.052
Vamos a continuar con una media hora
de música sin interrupción.

25:35.309 --> 25:38.390
You left the radio
on the ground?

25:38.475 --> 25:40.549
Sorry, I forgot.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.726
Is that a coyote?

26:03.810 --> 26:06.345
Yep.

26:06.435 --> 26:09.386
Man, he better keep quiet.

26:09.477 --> 26:12.558
Yep.

26:23.519 --> 26:26.766
He took it.
Hey, it's my turn.

26:26.852 --> 26:29.767
Oh, c-come on, Earl.
Let me get one more.

26:29.852 --> 26:31.760
Shit.

26:33.061 --> 26:36.012
Rock breaks scissors.
I win.

26:36.103 --> 26:38.970
It does?

26:44.145 --> 26:46.598
I told you one stick
would be enough.

26:46.686 --> 26:49.056
<i>You're right.</i>

26:49.145 --> 26:53.055
That makes $300,000.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.052
Apiece.

26:55.145 --> 26:58.641
I'm feelin'
light-headed, Earl.

26:58.729 --> 27:01.561
And whatcha gonna do
with all your money?

27:01.645 --> 27:04.560
Invest it.
Well, yeah, of course,
invest it, but...

27:04.645 --> 27:07.395
Even at five percent,
I'll be doin' pretty good.

27:07.479 --> 27:12.681
Five percent?
You're talkin', um, mutual funds
or C.D. S or somethin', huh?

27:12.771 --> 27:16.717
That's right.
That's small, Earl.
You're thinkin' small.

27:16.813 --> 27:20.013
See, I'm thinkin'
<i>big,</i> okay?

27:20.104 --> 27:22.474
I'm thinkin' <i>theme park.</i>

27:22.563 --> 27:27.304
Now, now.
"Grady Hoover's World
of Natural Wonders."

27:27.396 --> 27:31.769
Whoa! Or, you know,
maybe somethin' simple,

27:31.855 --> 27:35.765
like "Monster World,"
or "Monsterland"...

27:35.855 --> 27:37.762
or "Worm World."

27:37.855 --> 27:41.434
How 'bout "Looney World"?
Seems to fit.
Get off the ground!

27:41.522 --> 27:43.429
It's vision, Earl.

27:43.522 --> 27:47.350
Vision is what separates
the average...

27:55.731 --> 27:58.302
I know that song.

28:01.273 --> 28:04.685
<i>Jesus! Get off the ground,</i>
<i>Grady! Get off the ground!</i>

28:04.773 --> 28:09.181
Whoa!

28:09.273 --> 28:13.349
Jesus, man,
those things are huge!

28:13.440 --> 28:15.928
Shh! Be quiet!
Did you see that mouth?

28:23.107 --> 28:25.560
Oh, no.

28:25.649 --> 28:27.723
<i>It snagged the chain.</i>

28:35.732 --> 28:38.766
Can it do that?

28:44.649 --> 28:46.770
It can't be that strong.

28:54.108 --> 28:56.597
Son of a bitch!

29:01.692 --> 29:04.358
- Hit the brakes!
- I am! I did!

29:04.442 --> 29:06.397
It doesn't work!

29:12.817 --> 29:16.100
Earl!
What do I do?

29:16.192 --> 29:18.894
<i>- I don't know.</i>
<i>Do anything!</i>
- Ooh!

29:39.235 --> 29:42.766
- Cliff!
- Oh, no.

29:53.569 --> 29:57.645
He stopped. He stopped.

30:02.694 --> 30:06.818
Oh, shit.

30:14.570 --> 30:16.477
Oh, come on.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.399
Rock!

30:31.487 --> 30:35.232
<i>Rock!</i>
He's going under it!

30:35.320 --> 30:38.069
Turn! Turn the wheel!

30:38.154 --> 30:41.068
- Turn!
- I'm trying; I'm trying!

30:41.154 --> 30:43.903
Oh, God, oh, God!

30:47.779 --> 30:49.687
<i>Yee-ha!</i>

30:54.696 --> 30:57.232
All right.

30:57.321 --> 30:59.229
You all right?

30:59.321 --> 31:02.236
Wow, chain broke
right off.

31:02.321 --> 31:04.229
Jesus, we're lucky.

31:08.238 --> 31:11.153
Well, truck seems
to be all right.

31:11.238 --> 31:15.067
Earl, that's gonna be the first
ride in my theme park.

31:15.155 --> 31:18.023
Doesn't anything
ever get you down?

31:18.114 --> 31:21.028
Well, I'm blessed
with a sunny disposition.

31:21.114 --> 31:23.685
Most people
seem to like it.

31:25.906 --> 31:29.354
Oh, yeah? What does this
do for your disposition?

31:34.781 --> 31:37.483
I think we're gonna
need some help.

31:37.573 --> 31:40.985
Help? Who'd be crazy enough
to help us with this mess?

31:50.490 --> 31:55.527
<i>The big guns pounded enemy</i>
<i>positions for 72 straight hours.</i>

31:55.615 --> 31:59.312
<i>It was the deadliest</i>
<i>bombardment of the siege.</i>

31:59.407 --> 32:01.279
Yeah?

32:01.365 --> 32:04.980
Hey, Burt, it's Earl.
How ya doin'?

32:05.074 --> 32:06.981
Listen, um,

32:07.074 --> 32:09.989
If this sounds kinda funny, it's
'cause I'm on a radio phone.

32:10.074 --> 32:13.025
It's the only way we
can call out of this place.

32:13.116 --> 32:18.781
Earl? Oh... Earl.
Haven't seen you in a while.

32:20.574 --> 32:24.438
<i>Well, I haven't seen you.</i>
<i>Guess you've been layin'</i>
<i>kinda low, huh?</i>

32:24.533 --> 32:27.022
Layin' low?
No. Negative.

32:27.116 --> 32:30.482
I've been real busy...
lots of projects.

32:30.575 --> 32:33.822
So, uh, how
you and Heather doing?

32:33.908 --> 32:38.779
Well, she, uh...
She's still visiting her sister.

32:38.867 --> 32:41.190
Yeah?

32:41.284 --> 32:44.116
You know, she actually...

32:44.200 --> 32:47.613
blames our problems on the
collapse of the Soviet Union?

32:47.701 --> 32:50.533
Well, you did take that
kinda hard, Burt.

32:50.617 --> 32:56.484
Said I was hard to live with.
Said I couldn't handle life
without the threat of war.

32:56.576 --> 33:01.613
What kind of thing
is that to say to a man?
Well, I don't know, Burt...

33:01.701 --> 33:05.197
Anyway, it takes more
than that to get me down.

33:05.285 --> 33:08.199
I been running around so much,
it's lucky you caught me home.

33:08.285 --> 33:13.238
Well, in that case, I don't know
if you'd be interested in this.

33:13.327 --> 33:17.237
I'm down in Mexico,
see, and I find myself
in a sort of situation.

33:17.327 --> 33:19.780
What kind of situation?

33:22.660 --> 33:25.231
A graboid
kind of situation.

33:39.994 --> 33:42.992
Hey, you keepin'
an eye on that monitor?

33:43.078 --> 33:46.325
Uh, yeah, I'm watchin' it.
They're just stayin' up north.

33:54.661 --> 33:57.613
- Oh, my God!
What?

33:57.703 --> 34:00.405
Sorry. Come here.
Come here. Look at this.

34:03.870 --> 34:08.777
I've been staring
at this fossil for over a month,
and I just realized what it is.

34:08.870 --> 34:12.781
Hey, Earl, that looks like one
of those spikes on their sides.

34:12.871 --> 34:14.777
<i>Okay, it resembles one.</i>

34:14.871 --> 34:19.112
<i>I really think it is</i>
<i>a fossil fragment of a graboid.</i>

34:19.204 --> 34:21.609
<i>It's gonna take</i>
<i>months to prove...</i>

34:21.704 --> 34:23.659
No, this is important,
isn't it?

34:23.746 --> 34:26.413
Science has never
determined their origin.

34:26.496 --> 34:29.032
I read that in <i>People.</i>

34:29.121 --> 34:34.620
And that's true. But that's not
the only thing. You guys,
this is Precambrian rock.

34:36.621 --> 34:38.577
Precambrian.

34:41.163 --> 34:44.327
Precambrian. That means
that this is the oldest
life form on the planet.

34:44.413 --> 34:47.328
<i>I mean other than one-celled</i>
<i>things. But look at that.</i>

34:47.414 --> 34:51.489
- Wait a minute.
Older than dinosaurs?
<i>- Way.</i>

34:51.580 --> 34:54.495
So they're from earth,
right? Damn.
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:54.580 --> 34:57.199
I always thought
they were from outer space.

34:57.289 --> 35:00.370
<i>Doesn't look like it.</i>

35:00.456 --> 35:03.619
<i>¡Mira, mira!</i>
<i>¡El monstruo más grande...</i>
<i>viene acá!</i>

35:03.706 --> 35:05.910
Look! Look at
the seismograph! Look!

35:05.998 --> 35:08.747
<i>¡El monstruo viene!</i>
<i>¡Es grande!</i>

35:21.998 --> 35:24.321
It ain't no graboid.

35:24.415 --> 35:26.655
It's somethin'
more dangerous.

35:40.749 --> 35:42.656
Monster H.Q., I presume.

35:42.749 --> 35:45.320
Hey, Burt,
good to see you.
Earl, good to see you.

35:45.416 --> 35:49.457
Uh, this is Kate,
uh, Pedro,
Hey, what's up?

35:49.541 --> 35:52.954
Julio, and, uh...
The pleasure is mine.

35:53.041 --> 35:56.205
Grady, Grady Hoover.
Yeah, I read all about you,
Mr... Mr. Gummer.

35:56.291 --> 35:59.242
- Yeah, it's a real...
real honor.
- Yes.

35:59.333 --> 36:03.493
Man, you think you got
a big enough truck here?
He the new guy?

36:03.583 --> 36:06.617
<i>So, did you get me one</i>
<i>of those seismo-monitors?</i>

36:06.708 --> 36:09.908
<i>Hey, no problem.</i>
What you got in this thing?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.240
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

36:12.334 --> 36:15.083
Don't touch.
Don't touch. Easy.

36:15.167 --> 36:17.572
Mexican army gave me
this truck...

36:20.292 --> 36:23.243
And a few little items
on my wish list.

36:26.751 --> 36:31.076
Ho!

36:32.793 --> 36:35.826
It's, uh, a bit much,
don't you think?

36:42.001 --> 36:45.284
Maybe I'm wrong.

36:45.376 --> 36:47.284
Hope I'm right.

36:53.293 --> 36:56.327
Makes my home-made stuff
look like cherry bombs.

36:56.419 --> 37:01.953
Thermite, C-4, TNT,
high-explosive... H.E.

37:02.044 --> 37:04.711
Is there such thing
as "low-explosive"?

37:07.877 --> 37:10.034
Well, y-yes,
son, there is.

37:10.127 --> 37:15.034
I mean, the <i>federales</i> offer
you anything you want, and you
guys take <i>one</i> case of dynamite?

37:15.128 --> 37:17.616
What the hell
is this thing for?

37:17.711 --> 37:21.871
That, uh, might end up
in my collection.

37:21.961 --> 37:24.912
Hey, got some, uh, new equipment
for you, gentlemen.

37:27.003 --> 37:29.918
Your backup weapons.
Can you handle a firearm?

37:30.003 --> 37:32.788
I'll check him out.

37:32.878 --> 37:34.786
Shotguns?

37:34.878 --> 37:37.793
We're not huntin'
rabbits down here, Burt.

37:37.879 --> 37:41.209
Not shotguns.
Double rifles. Elephant guns.

37:41.295 --> 37:46.451
Wesley-Richards 480,
375 H&H Mag.

37:46.546 --> 37:50.243
Knockdown power
up the yin-yang.
Treat them well.

37:50.337 --> 37:54.663
But hold 'em good 'n tight
to your shoulder, or they'll
break your collarbone.

37:54.754 --> 37:58.120
So where's, uh, Mrs. Gummer?
She didn't want to come?

37:58.213 --> 38:02.289
<i>Uh, why don't you get this,</i>
<i>uh, stuff in our truck?</i>

38:04.505 --> 38:06.412
Sure, no problem.

38:11.130 --> 38:15.455
Look, man, I... really want
to thank you for comin' down.

38:17.088 --> 38:18.996
We're in pretty deep here.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.162
Oh, forget it, Earl.

38:21.255 --> 38:27.122
To tell you the truth, if I
didn't get out of that house,
I was gonna go crazy.

38:29.214 --> 38:31.205
Heather's not comin' back.

38:31.297 --> 38:33.418
No?

38:33.506 --> 38:37.167
She called me and told me
to send her the H.K. -91.

38:37.256 --> 38:39.377
Whew. Ouch.

38:39.464 --> 38:41.420
Yep.

38:42.673 --> 38:44.580
So.

38:46.048 --> 38:50.587
Anyway, it'll be good to get
into somethin' constructive.

38:53.923 --> 38:56.459
Oh, my.
What is this?

38:56.548 --> 38:59.795
Grizzly single-shot
50-calibre B.M. G...

38:59.882 --> 39:02.714
based on a World War I
antitank cartridge.

39:02.798 --> 39:07.255
- Antitank?
- Had the bullets custom cast
from solid bronze.

39:07.340 --> 39:11.500
Man, Burt, you put a whole new
shine on the word "overkill."

39:11.591 --> 39:15.335
When you need it
and don't have it,
you sing a different tune.

39:47.217 --> 39:50.832
Well, this is it, Burt.
Okay.

39:50.925 --> 39:54.089
I'll patrol east.
You take the west.

39:57.551 --> 40:00.465
You know, those are
terrible for you.

40:00.551 --> 40:04.461
<i>You need complex carbohydrates.</i>
<i>Lower those L.D.L.s.</i>

40:04.551 --> 40:07.300
I gave up smoking, Burt.
What more do you want?

40:07.384 --> 40:11.793
- Have an M.R.E.
- A what?

40:11.885 --> 40:13.792
Meals Ready to Eat.

40:13.885 --> 40:15.792
Freeze-dried, foil sealed.

40:15.885 --> 40:19.665
It's got to be foil. Plastic
is <i>not</i> an oxygen barrier.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.877
Includes entrée,
cracker pack, cheese spread,

40:22.968 --> 40:25.966
mixed fruit, beverage powder,
spoon, coffee,

40:26.052 --> 40:30.626
cream substitute, candy, salt,
matches, toilet tissue.

40:30.719 --> 40:33.385
Shelf life of ten years.

40:33.469 --> 40:36.799
Here, take a few.

40:36.886 --> 40:39.800
Buy 'em all the time.
Saves trips to the supermarket.

40:39.886 --> 40:41.923
<i>Oh, no, Burt.</i>

40:42.011 --> 40:44.499
We don't want to use up
all your food.
<i>No problem.</i>

40:44.594 --> 40:47.047
Brought 120 pounds of it.

40:47.136 --> 40:49.091
Good luck, <i>compadres.</i>

40:58.511 --> 41:02.920
<i>Oh, man, this stuff</i>
<i>tastes like toilet paper.</i>

41:03.012 --> 41:07.088
<i>Earl, that</i> is
<i>the toilet paper.</i>

41:21.679 --> 41:24.961
14 May.

41:25.054 --> 41:28.005
1500 hours.

41:28.096 --> 41:32.670
I have a confirmed
graboid reading.

41:32.763 --> 41:36.045
I'm now employing the technique
pioneered by Earl Basset...

41:36.138 --> 41:39.966
to make my first kill.

41:46.555 --> 41:48.546
Subject has taken
the bait.

41:48.638 --> 41:50.546
Preparing to fire.

41:50.638 --> 41:52.594
Yes!

42:11.389 --> 42:13.676
Memo:

42:13.764 --> 42:17.260
Four pounds of C-4
may be a little...

42:20.431 --> 42:22.339
excessive.

42:27.765 --> 42:31.426
<i>Yo, Grady and Earl.</i>
<i>I got one. Over.</i>

42:33.223 --> 42:36.589
Yeah, we know, Burt.
We heard it clear over here.

42:36.682 --> 42:40.592
Damnedest thing. It had a big
chain hangin' out of its mouth.

42:40.682 --> 42:44.427
Damn it. Burt, you skunk,
that one was ours.

42:44.515 --> 42:48.924
<i>Oh, yeah, son? I didn't see</i>
<i>your name on it. Over and out.</i>

42:49.016 --> 42:51.504
Why did we
invite him, anyway?

42:51.599 --> 42:53.590
Hey, pay attention.

42:53.683 --> 42:57.344
Whoa.
We got one.

42:57.433 --> 42:59.507
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

42:59.599 --> 43:02.135
It's movin' away from us.

43:02.225 --> 43:06.716
It must be
somethin' else.

43:06.808 --> 43:08.715
Like what,
a giant prairie dog?

43:08.808 --> 43:12.423
Well, shit, I don't know, Earl.
It's movin' away from us.

43:15.017 --> 43:17.766
Should we follow it?

43:27.976 --> 43:30.890
<i>What the hell is</i>
<i>the matter with him?</i>

43:30.976 --> 43:34.223
We're makin'
plenty of noise.

43:34.309 --> 43:38.517
I don't like it, Grady.
They're gettin' smarter.
That's what they do.

43:38.601 --> 43:41.516
They got some kinda
plan goin' here.

43:41.601 --> 43:46.223
I tell ya, these boys
are up to somethin' new.

43:47.768 --> 43:50.932
They're diggin'
a trap for us, or...

43:51.018 --> 43:52.925
playin' possum,

43:53.018 --> 43:55.423
Or somethin'.

44:01.768 --> 44:04.339
Holy Mother!

44:04.435 --> 44:07.303
Oh, man, oh, man!

44:13.519 --> 44:15.806
Shit! Shit, how
could I do that?

44:15.894 --> 44:17.801
I gotta get
to Burt's gun!

44:19.478 --> 44:21.433
Whoa.

44:24.728 --> 44:27.477
- Where is he?
Should be all over us.
- I don't know.

44:30.436 --> 44:34.430
- What is that?
Can they do that?
- Shh.

44:36.395 --> 44:38.599
That's a new one on me.

44:44.729 --> 44:47.643
Jesus, Grady, what are you
doin'? Get off the ground!

44:47.729 --> 44:52.351
I know, I know.
I got an idea. Trust me.

44:58.146 --> 45:00.634
Damn it, Grady,
come on back.

45:09.604 --> 45:11.679
He's still there.

45:17.688 --> 45:21.729
What the hell's
it doing?

45:21.813 --> 45:24.219
I have no idea.

46:04.857 --> 46:07.345
Something's wrong
with him.

46:07.440 --> 46:09.347
Must be sick.

46:09.440 --> 46:12.355
Probably ate somebody
that didn't agree with it.

46:23.732 --> 46:25.640
Jesus, Grady!

46:35.274 --> 46:37.182
It's okay, Earl.

46:37.275 --> 46:41.185
He's not goin' anywhere.

46:41.275 --> 46:43.182
Hey!

46:44.275 --> 46:48.399
We just caught ourselves
a live one.

46:48.483 --> 46:51.600
That's $100,000, Earl.

46:51.692 --> 46:53.599
Oh, yes!

46:53.692 --> 46:56.607
Oh, yeah?
What're you gonna do,
carry him back?

46:56.692 --> 46:58.599
We just wrecked
the truck.

47:00.650 --> 47:03.139
Oh, yeah.

47:09.609 --> 47:12.098
Hello, this is Earl
to anybody.

47:12.193 --> 47:14.681
<i>Anybody there?</i>

47:14.776 --> 47:18.272
Hey, Earl, it's Kate.
How're you guys doin'?
Well, uh...

47:19.610 --> 47:22.228
we kinda wrecked our truck
a little bit.
What?

47:22.318 --> 47:24.225
A-Are you okay?

47:24.318 --> 47:27.233
We're fine. We're gonna need
somebody to come fetch us.

47:27.318 --> 47:32.189
Let me talk to her.
Would you tell Pedro to bring
that big truck of his out here?

47:32.277 --> 47:35.524
It's got a crane on it,
doesn't it?
Yeah.

47:35.610 --> 47:37.601
<i>It's going to</i>
<i>take him hours.</i>

47:37.694 --> 47:40.147
Tell him to bring it
because...

47:40.235 --> 47:45.900
- We're gonna winch that slinky
off to Monster World.
- Get off the damn ground!

47:45.986 --> 47:48.190
I'm off; I'm off.

48:03.445 --> 48:06.229
Jesus!

48:06.320 --> 48:09.234
Damn it, he got
himself another one.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.987
The man never sleeps.

48:14.945 --> 48:19.401
<i>Guys, Burt here, doin'</i>
<i>a little night fishing.</i>

48:19.487 --> 48:24.393
<i>Got three of 'em</i>
<i>on a cluster charge. I'd say</i>
<i>we're about even now. Over.</i>

48:24.487 --> 48:28.018
Come on, Burt.
This isn't a competition.
Who's competing?

48:28.112 --> 48:31.027
I'm just saying the score's
tied, that's all. Over.

48:31.112 --> 48:34.774
Well, <i>son,</i> no it isn't,
'cause we just caught
ourselves a live one.

48:34.862 --> 48:39.188
A live one? How in the...
That's a trade secret.
Happy huntin', Burt.

48:41.654 --> 48:44.652
I'll bet that burned
his skinny ass.

48:47.530 --> 48:51.109
God Almighty!

48:55.280 --> 48:57.685
Somethin's wrong
with our worm, Earl.

48:58.822 --> 49:01.606
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

49:11.114 --> 49:14.645
Maybe somethin's tryin'
to eat it out there...
coyotes or somethin'.

49:14.739 --> 49:16.895
They'll have plenty to eat.

49:16.989 --> 49:20.355
Come on, Earl. We have got
to protect our investment.
We can't just sit here.

49:23.031 --> 49:25.271
Jesus, listen to it!

49:25.364 --> 49:29.310
Poor thing. I mean,
don't you just feel
a little sorry for him?

49:29.406 --> 49:32.819
No.

49:32.906 --> 49:34.814
That's cold, Earl.

49:39.282 --> 49:42.445
Where's that Pedro
and that damn truck?

50:25.533 --> 50:28.734
Something ate it!

50:28.825 --> 50:31.396
In two minutes?

50:31.492 --> 50:34.940
<i> Well, somethin'</i>
<i>happened to it, 'cause</i>
<i>there is nothin' left inside.</i>

50:41.201 --> 50:45.408
Something came out of it.
What do you mean,
something came out of it?

50:45.493 --> 50:48.905
It did that thing that things do
when they change, you know...

50:48.993 --> 50:50.900
there's a word
for it, uh...

50:50.993 --> 50:55.152
It turned into something else
like a caterpillar does.

50:55.243 --> 50:59.023
Only I bet that
whatever came out wasn't
no sweet little butterfly.

51:06.118 --> 51:09.033
Damn worms never
cut you any slack.

51:11.869 --> 51:14.618
<i>I said you all ought to</i>
<i>head out to Rioverde.</i>

51:14.702 --> 51:18.566
Clear out 'til we know
what's going on. Over.

51:22.744 --> 51:25.742
Kate, did you
get any of that? Over.

51:29.203 --> 51:31.442
Shit! Now, what?

51:31.536 --> 51:34.736
The radio's out.
How could that be?
I was just talking to her.

51:38.411 --> 51:41.196
Man! You know
what that is, don't you?

51:41.286 --> 51:43.989
Yeah. Another one's
doing it.

51:47.787 --> 51:49.742
There! There's Pedro!

51:53.745 --> 51:57.241
'Bout damn time.

52:03.162 --> 52:05.781
- He stopped.
- He stopped?

52:05.871 --> 52:08.620
Maybe he's taking a leak?

52:15.204 --> 52:17.775
That's a long leak.

52:18.913 --> 52:21.697
Hey, Pedro! Pedro!

52:30.288 --> 52:33.784
Well,

52:33.872 --> 52:36.953
maybe we should go over
and see what's wrong.

52:37.039 --> 52:41.198
Go over? You mean, walk a mile
across open country?

52:42.539 --> 52:46.663
I'm not going six feet
from that seismo.

52:46.747 --> 52:50.243
<i>Come on. There's no graboids</i>
<i>anywhere near us right now.</i>

52:52.581 --> 52:55.781
Now, I say we go
while the going's good.

53:02.165 --> 53:05.246
You know, you could
carry some of this stuff.

53:06.540 --> 53:08.447
I got what I want.

53:15.082 --> 53:18.530
Well, I can't say
this looks good.

53:23.915 --> 53:25.871
Pedro?

53:27.124 --> 53:29.079
Hey, Pedro!

53:30.957 --> 53:33.446
Man!

53:33.541 --> 53:35.994
This brings
back memories.

53:49.083 --> 53:53.408
<i>Jesus! Looks like somebody</i>
<i>took a can opener to the thing.</i>

53:55.083 --> 53:56.991
Oh, man!
Look at that engine.

53:57.083 --> 53:58.991
It's torn to pieces.

54:03.167 --> 54:05.738
Pedro!

54:05.834 --> 54:08.748
Damn it!
Where are you?

54:14.751 --> 54:16.706
<i>Hey! There he is!</i>

54:18.959 --> 54:21.329
<i>Pedro?</i>

54:21.418 --> 54:23.325
Oh, God!

54:23.418 --> 54:25.539
Oh, God!

54:27.501 --> 54:30.369
Whoa! It's a whole
new ball game.

54:30.460 --> 54:32.450
A whole new
goddam ball game.

54:32.543 --> 54:35.114
Well... Well, you know
what to do, right?

54:35.210 --> 54:38.125
Right?
I don't know shit!

54:40.585 --> 54:43.156
<i>Okay! Okay!</i>

54:43.252 --> 54:46.203
We can hike over
to that radio tower.

54:46.294 --> 54:50.832
Th-Th-They've gotta
have a radio that's working.
We can, uh... We can call direct.

55:03.253 --> 55:07.163
14 May. 1900 hours.

55:07.253 --> 55:10.583
I've been out of radio contact
for several hours,

55:10.670 --> 55:14.912
unable to reach Grady and Earl
or anybody at H.Q.

55:18.462 --> 55:21.413
The situation dictates
that I return to base.

55:45.838 --> 55:47.793
A further mystery:

55:47.879 --> 55:51.210
<i>I've not had a single</i>
<i>seismic reading in hours,</i>

55:51.296 --> 55:54.911
yet I tracked one
of the sightless brutes
right into this valley.

55:56.296 --> 55:59.627
Where the hell did he go?

55:59.713 --> 56:01.621
They do get smarter.

56:01.713 --> 56:03.621
Is it possible he learned...

56:03.713 --> 56:09.295
to avoid the unique sound
of my deuce-and-half's
mil-spec engine?

56:09.380 --> 56:13.077
I do not have the answer
at this time.

56:20.881 --> 56:24.163
<i>Oh, no, no, no. Don't tell me</i>
<i>that's the radio stuff.</i>

56:24.256 --> 56:27.207
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

56:29.714 --> 56:34.870
Oh, man!
Can't we ever
get a goddam break?

56:34.965 --> 56:37.500
If we get outta here alive,
I'll count that as a break.

56:37.590 --> 56:40.374
I mean, there wasn't
even any people here to eat.

56:40.465 --> 56:44.459
<i>They're doing this</i>
<i>on purpose, man.</i>

56:44.548 --> 56:47.333
They're cuttin' us off
on purpose!

56:47.423 --> 56:51.500
Shh! Shh!
Quiet! Quiet!

56:51.590 --> 56:54.423
I told you
they get smarter.

56:59.757 --> 57:02.080
Hey, look.

57:03.882 --> 57:06.715
Oh, yes! Yes!

57:06.799 --> 57:08.873
It's not gonna have a key.

57:08.966 --> 57:12.794
So I'll hot-wire
the damn thing.
I like that.

57:26.467 --> 57:28.623
<i>Grady! Grady!</i>

57:28.717 --> 57:31.964
What is that?
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>but it's comin' this way.</i>

57:46.926 --> 57:50.587
<i>Jesus! How big is this thing?</i>

58:06.718 --> 58:08.626
What the hell is that?

58:15.052 --> 58:17.457
Is that it?

58:17.552 --> 58:20.301
Sure ain't no damn ostrich.

58:20.385 --> 58:25.292
How does a 30-foot worm
turn into that little thing?
Shh! Might hear us.

58:37.428 --> 58:40.047
Shit! It heard us.

58:47.095 --> 58:49.002
Wait.

58:50.470 --> 58:52.425
We got it!

58:53.678 --> 58:55.586
We got it!

59:06.929 --> 59:08.836
Ugly little toad.

59:10.637 --> 59:12.545
No eyes.

59:12.637 --> 59:15.422
Wow!
Just like the big ones.

59:16.596 --> 59:21.170
Earl, man. We oughta
take this one with us.

59:21.263 --> 59:23.502
You crazy?
What?

59:27.805 --> 59:30.756
Sounds like a bunch of them!

59:33.013 --> 59:35.502
<i>Come on, man!</i>
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

59:35.597 --> 59:38.002
- I'm tryin'! I'm tryin'!
- Let's go!

01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:33.631
<i>Pedro. Can you hear me?</i>

01:00:33.724 --> 01:00:35.845
<i>Earl, come on!</i>
<i>Talk to me.</i>

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:39.968
Burt? Anybody?

01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:42.972
God! What the hell
is going on?

01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:49.507
Oh, man!
Hey!

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.380
Julio, man, you
scared me half to death!
Sorry.

01:00:53.475 --> 01:00:56.675
Oh, shit.
You know the radios...
They're out?

01:00:56.766 --> 01:00:59.006
I know.
That's what I've
been doin' here.

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.505
I think the repeater towers
are down.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.384
How can that be?
I don't know.

01:01:04.475 --> 01:01:06.382
Something
coming our way?

01:01:06.475 --> 01:01:11.049
No! The creatures have
completely disappeared
off the screen. It's weird.

01:01:11.142 --> 01:01:14.757
With the radios all out,
shouldn't everybody come back?

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.553
Yeah, everybody should have
been here a long time ago.

01:01:17.642 --> 01:01:20.475
I don't like this.
This is not good.

01:01:20.559 --> 01:01:22.964
Okay, stay here
with the seismos.

01:01:23.059 --> 01:01:25.382
I'm going to go look for them
right now.

01:01:25.476 --> 01:01:28.427
Okay, but...

01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:32.090
Oh, my God!

01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:40.509
Oh, no!

01:01:42.518 --> 01:01:44.888
No! No!

01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:12.177
<i>Get him!</i>

01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:15.184
<i>Get him!</i>

01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:18.969
<i>Bastards!</i>

01:02:21.853 --> 01:02:25.053
Kate!
What are they?

01:02:25.145 --> 01:02:28.013
We don't know.
The worms change somehow.

01:02:28.103 --> 01:02:32.844
Now we've got these things.
Julio! Julio!
They... They...

01:02:32.937 --> 01:02:36.184
- I know. I know.
<i>- We got them, though.</i>
<i>We just blew 'em away!</i>

01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:38.391
Pedro! Did Pedro find you?

01:02:38.479 --> 01:02:41.809
No. They jumped his truck.
He's dead too.

01:02:46.104 --> 01:02:48.640
Have you seen Burt?
Did he get back?

01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:54.394
No. I tried to call him.
I tried you. The radio...
<i>Uh, excuse me.</i>

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:57.726
But I think
we should get goin'.

01:02:57.813 --> 01:03:00.480
You okay?
Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:03:08.063 --> 01:03:10.730
- Oh, no!
- Not again!

01:03:22.647 --> 01:03:27.849
They wrecked our car,
Pedro's truck, the radio tower.
How can they be so smart?

01:03:27.939 --> 01:03:30.143
Let's get
our butts inside.

01:03:32.439 --> 01:03:34.347
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>we gonna do?</i>

01:03:34.439 --> 01:03:38.515
Get these windows shut!
It's like they got
the whole thing planned.

01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:42.682
Grady! Grady! Come on!
All right. How many
do you think there are?

01:03:42.773 --> 01:03:44.680
All right,
I remember. I remember.

01:03:44.773 --> 01:03:48.637
There was three big sacks,
or bags, in that one
we saw split open.

01:03:48.732 --> 01:03:52.772
<i>Huh, Earl? Can't be more</i>
<i>than three of those things</i>
<i>in each worm.</i>

01:03:52.857 --> 01:03:55.143
Yeah, I... I...
That's right, I guess.

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:57.981
Kate, how many big worms
were left out there?

01:03:58.065 --> 01:04:01.348
You killed all but eight
graboids. I was watching.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.269
So if all eight of them changed,
that would make, uh...

01:04:05.357 --> 01:04:07.395
Twenty-four!
Twenty-four
of those things left!

01:04:07.482 --> 01:04:10.231
How many have you killed?
Well, let's see...

01:04:10.316 --> 01:04:13.895
We, uh... We killed
one on the radio tower
and... and one out there...

01:04:13.982 --> 01:04:16.732
and, um, on top of the car.

01:04:16.816 --> 01:04:20.312
That's it?
Well, I'm sorry.

01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:23.931
No. It's just that I mean...

01:04:24.025 --> 01:04:25.932
Oh, man!
Now what?

01:04:28.441 --> 01:04:30.811
Thank God, it's Burt.

01:04:33.275 --> 01:04:35.680
Yes!
They didn't get him.

01:04:50.609 --> 01:04:52.516
I think they did get him.

01:05:07.443 --> 01:05:09.398
<i>Burt!</i>

01:05:11.318 --> 01:05:13.273
Burt, you okay?

01:05:15.277 --> 01:05:17.184
<i>Burt?</i>

01:05:18.568 --> 01:05:21.934
I feel I was denied...

01:05:22.027 --> 01:05:27.478
critical, need-to-know
information.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.768
Well, we're sorry, Burt.

01:05:32.486 --> 01:05:34.891
They just changed
all of a sudden, man.

01:05:34.986 --> 01:05:39.275
<i>We would have warned you,</i>
<i>but they knocked out</i>
<i>the radio tower.</i>

01:05:40.778 --> 01:05:42.685
Come on, Burt!
What happened?

01:05:42.778 --> 01:05:46.475
Well, when the radios
went out,

01:05:46.569 --> 01:05:49.058
I decided to return
to the refinery.

01:05:49.153 --> 01:05:54.438
<i>But en route, I find</i>
<i>I'm in an ambush situation.</i>

01:05:54.528 --> 01:05:57.147
Must have been a couple
of dozen of these things!

01:05:57.237 --> 01:06:02.854
I dropped the first wave
with semi auto fire,
but they just kept coming.

01:06:02.945 --> 01:06:07.852
Most were in front of the truck,
so I popped it in six-wheel
and ran 'em down.

01:06:07.945 --> 01:06:10.979
The ones that got on board,
I handled with a combination...

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:14.401
of small arms fire
and hand-to-hand techniques.

01:06:18.112 --> 01:06:22.023
I am completely out of ammo.

01:06:27.404 --> 01:06:29.312
That's never
happened to me before.

01:06:29.404 --> 01:06:32.356
<i>Well, shit!</i>
<i>Who cares, Burt?</i>

01:06:32.446 --> 01:06:35.017
Sounds like you
killed 'em all, huh?

01:06:35.113 --> 01:06:38.526
I hope not.
These creatures
are very important.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:43.979
You know,
I mean scientifically.

01:06:44.072 --> 01:06:46.311
That fact was
not lost on me.

01:06:46.405 --> 01:06:50.481
When it was all over,
I saw one of the little
S.O.B. S was just stunned.

01:06:52.614 --> 01:06:54.688
So I detained him.

01:07:27.157 --> 01:07:29.610
Oh, man,
it's drooling.

01:07:33.074 --> 01:07:35.029
<i>Don't let him spook ya.</i>

01:07:35.115 --> 01:07:38.481
<i>That line</i>
<i>is 1,000-pound test.</i>

01:07:44.116 --> 01:07:46.687
<i>Go on.</i>
<i>Haul him out of there.</i>

01:07:50.574 --> 01:07:52.482
Hold on to that
son of a bitch!

01:07:52.574 --> 01:07:54.482
I'll get the door.

01:09:12.368 --> 01:09:15.486
I knew it.
Infrared.

01:09:15.578 --> 01:09:18.444
It doesn't hear us;
it doesn't actually see us;

01:09:18.536 --> 01:09:21.617
it senses the heat
of our bodies.

01:09:21.703 --> 01:09:25.649
See that?
The thing that rises up
must be the heat sensor.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:40.651
You feel that?

01:09:40.745 --> 01:09:43.696
Gives off a lot of heat
when it screams.

01:09:49.912 --> 01:09:52.910
That's it.

01:09:52.996 --> 01:09:56.361
I bet that's the way
they communicate.

01:09:56.454 --> 01:09:58.528
The sound doesn't matter.

01:09:58.621 --> 01:10:02.567
<i>They make noise,</i>
<i>but they signal each other</i>
<i>with their body heat.</i>

01:10:02.663 --> 01:10:06.526
It only sees heat?
Yes, that's not so weird.

01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:09.027
A rattlesnake
strikes at body heat.

01:10:10.621 --> 01:10:14.402
That's why
they tore up the cars...
because the engines were hot.

01:10:14.497 --> 01:10:17.032
<i>They thought it was food.</i>

01:10:17.122 --> 01:10:19.527
<i>And the same thing</i>
<i>with the radio tower.</i>

01:10:19.622 --> 01:10:22.241
That electronic gear
puts off all kinds of heat.

01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:25.032
So basically, they bite
anything that's warm.

01:10:25.122 --> 01:10:27.824
They been actin' so smart
'cause they're so stupid?

01:10:41.331 --> 01:10:44.163
Now, that's not warm.
How does he know to eat that?

01:10:44.248 --> 01:10:46.701
Well, it tastes it
with its tongue.

01:10:46.789 --> 01:10:50.072
See how he's draggin'
his tongue all over.

01:10:50.165 --> 01:10:52.155
<i>Touches anything</i>
<i>he likes, uh,</i>

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.116
he eats it.

01:10:55.206 --> 01:10:57.695
How much can he eat?
Those M.R.E. S aren't cheap,
you know.

01:11:04.165 --> 01:11:06.037
Looks like he's had enough.

01:11:06.124 --> 01:11:09.205
<i>You're feeding it too much!</i>
<i>You made it sick.</i>

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:12.454
Give me a break.
Probably your nasty food
made it sick.

01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:36.954
Oh, good God!

01:12:00.959 --> 01:12:02.866
Hermaphrodites.

01:12:10.043 --> 01:12:12.792
They reproduce
without having sex.

01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:17.581
I claim the little one.
Hey, it was my food!

01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:21.911
Whenever one of them gets
enough food, they just bla-a-ah,
and there's another one.

01:12:22.002 --> 01:12:25.000
Then one makes two,
two makes four,

01:12:25.085 --> 01:12:27.206
four makes eight...
It's exponential.

01:12:27.293 --> 01:12:32.034
Well, uh, hell.
That gives 'em quite an edge.

01:12:32.127 --> 01:12:34.794
You never see this
in higher animals. Ever!

01:12:34.877 --> 01:12:36.784
It's astounding.

01:12:36.877 --> 01:12:38.784
Don't you guys get it?

01:12:38.877 --> 01:12:41.413
Oh, we get it.
We just don't want it.

01:12:41.877 --> 01:12:43.418
<i>The little one's</i>
<i>getting big already.</i>

01:12:43.502 --> 01:12:45.410
<i>Uh, I think we better</i>
<i>think about leaving.</i>

01:12:45.502 --> 01:12:49.331
These guys have taken
a completely different
evolutionary path.

01:12:59.003 --> 01:13:03.044
They got into your damn
super-food, Burt!

01:13:03.128 --> 01:13:05.036
Go! Go!

01:13:05.128 --> 01:13:07.747
Yeah! Yeah!

01:13:07.837 --> 01:13:10.503
The warehouse! We
gotta close the warehouse!

01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:12.957
Oh! Oh!

01:13:14.129 --> 01:13:16.831
This way!
Grady! No!

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.918
<i>No! Not that way!</i>
<i>Grady!</i>

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:23.535
Grady, damn it!

01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:26.911
All right! All right!
This isn't gonna work.

01:13:27.004 --> 01:13:29.540
Shit!

01:13:42.796 --> 01:13:44.704
They stopped.

01:13:44.796 --> 01:13:48.079
They're just milling around.

01:13:48.172 --> 01:13:50.956
Looks like they
lost track of us.
That's not gonna last.

01:13:52.588 --> 01:13:55.670
We're like
sittin' ducks here!

01:13:55.755 --> 01:13:58.208
Well, it looked like
a goddam building!

01:13:58.297 --> 01:14:02.871
Why didn't you listen to me?
These little snappers
are blind and deaf.

01:14:02.964 --> 01:14:05.001
We've gotta
be able to beat them.

01:14:31.298 --> 01:14:34.711
I told ya,
they can't see us.

01:14:34.798 --> 01:14:37.915
Great, now what?
Now, move with me.

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:40.211
Move?

01:14:40.299 --> 01:14:43.581
It's gonna work, damn it.
Now move! And step, and step,

01:14:43.674 --> 01:14:48.461
and step and step...
I don't know how you
come up with this shit.

01:14:48.549 --> 01:14:51.038
I think on my feet.

01:14:51.132 --> 01:14:53.040
Come on! It's working.

01:14:53.132 --> 01:14:57.173
Comin' at ya.
Okay. All right.

01:14:57.258 --> 01:14:59.627
And down.

01:15:10.216 --> 01:15:13.380
So...

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:16.169
where are we going?

01:15:17.633 --> 01:15:19.541
Are there
any more cars left?

01:15:19.633 --> 01:15:21.708
Um, uh, yeah.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.841
One. Julio's.
It's by the storage tank.

01:15:25.925 --> 01:15:29.089
- Which way?
- Left. Move left.

01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:33.465
<i>Okay. Ready and moving left,</i>

01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:38.208
and step, and step, and step,

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:41.003
<i>and step and step.</i>

01:15:46.343 --> 01:15:48.298
Okay, it's
not much further.

01:15:50.135 --> 01:15:52.291
Oh!

01:15:54.301 --> 01:15:56.458
There's one
of them out there!

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.466
Oh, shit!
Did it see you?

01:15:59.552 --> 01:16:03.676
Well, if it had, I think
we'd be hearing about it by now.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.668
How far is it?

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.296
Uh, uh, 100 yards about.

01:16:08.385 --> 01:16:11.253
<i>That's a heck of a shot.</i>

01:16:11.344 --> 01:16:13.548
Uh-huh.

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:16.717
Whoa! You got
only one shot?
Then you gotta hit it...

01:16:16.802 --> 01:16:21.377
<i>before it sends one of those</i>
<i>heat signals to the others.</i>

01:16:21.469 --> 01:16:23.626
I know.

01:16:30.761 --> 01:16:32.669
Cover your ears.

01:16:45.512 --> 01:16:47.467
Oh, Jesus.

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.425
Jesus!

01:16:51.512 --> 01:16:54.925
<i>God! You smoked his ass.</i>

01:16:55.012 --> 01:16:58.259
Doin' what I can
with what I got.
Good.

01:17:08.513 --> 01:17:10.468
Oh, shit, partner.

01:17:14.555 --> 01:17:16.510
Oh, no! Pop the hood.

01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:19.760
<i>I got it, I got it.</i>

01:17:19.847 --> 01:17:21.802
Damn!

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.592
We're dead.

01:17:29.722 --> 01:17:31.796
What?

01:17:31.889 --> 01:17:34.175
I didn't know.
How could I've known?

01:17:36.305 --> 01:17:40.382
We're supposed to be
up against graboids!
I wanted maximum penetration.

01:17:40.472 --> 01:17:42.712
- Well, you've got it.
<i>- Now what?</i>

01:17:42.806 --> 01:17:45.969
<i>We can't stay here.</i>
<i>We've got to get inside.</i>

01:17:47.014 --> 01:17:49.005
Uh,

01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:51.005
Cantina!

01:18:08.473 --> 01:18:10.298
Damn!

01:18:31.266 --> 01:18:35.260
Burt?

01:18:35.349 --> 01:18:37.257
Uh-oh!

01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:39.424
Burt!

01:18:43.475 --> 01:18:45.430
Oh, no, Burt!

01:19:21.018 --> 01:19:25.557
<i>Burt, it's working;</i>
<i>They can't find you.</i>
<i>Don't move.</i>

01:19:25.643 --> 01:19:30.016
Good! Good idea.

01:19:36.519 --> 01:19:38.474
This is pathetic!

01:19:39.977 --> 01:19:42.928
Wait a minute!
I've got a plan,
I think!

01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:48.176
<i>Earl! Earl!</i>

01:19:48.269 --> 01:19:51.184
Yeah, I know! I know.
I just need another second.

01:20:10.937 --> 01:20:13.851
Ow! Ow!
Shit! Ouch!

01:20:15.187 --> 01:20:19.761
<i>That's great!</i>
<i>Uh, here. Here.</i>

01:20:21.562 --> 01:20:23.469
Get ready to run.

01:20:23.562 --> 01:20:26.051
We're gonna head
for those oil towers
and climb.

01:20:41.479 --> 01:20:44.312
Yes! Earl,
you're a genius.

01:20:46.938 --> 01:20:49.557
Come on!
It's clear. Hurry.

01:20:53.313 --> 01:20:55.683
You're okay.
They can't climb.

01:20:55.772 --> 01:20:58.095
Watch your shin.
Oh, man!

01:20:58.188 --> 01:21:01.601
They can't climb.
Pretty slick, my man.

01:21:01.688 --> 01:21:03.928
Slick?
That was brilliant.

01:21:04.022 --> 01:21:06.226
You really do think
on your feet, don't you?

01:21:06.314 --> 01:21:08.221
Yeah, well.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.388
Hey, where's Burt?

01:21:11.481 --> 01:21:15.521
Oh, over here.
And don't worry, they can't
even find him in there.

01:21:15.606 --> 01:21:18.557
Oh, man.
I think he's gonna
be okay for now.

01:21:24.106 --> 01:21:26.773
Oh, I'm just dandy!

01:21:26.856 --> 01:21:29.179
So what do we do now?

01:21:32.606 --> 01:21:34.893
Hey, Burt!

01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:38.975
Are you sure you don't
have any more bullets?
Did you check all your pockets?

01:21:41.065 --> 01:21:46.730
You know, as I lie here,
I can't help but comment:

01:21:46.815 --> 01:21:51.769
The reason I am out
of nine millimeter rounds
is I was not properly briefed.

01:21:51.857 --> 01:21:56.349
<i>And the reason</i>
<i>for that is this mission</i>
<i>was not properly researched.</i>

01:21:56.441 --> 01:22:00.304
If certain people had bothered
to gather intelligence
on the creatures...

01:22:00.399 --> 01:22:02.722
before bumbling
into the situation...

01:22:02.816 --> 01:22:06.016
Knock it off, Burt!
Nobody made you come.

01:22:06.108 --> 01:22:10.979
When we should be packing
full-auto, preferably belt-fed!

01:22:11.066 --> 01:22:14.017
Shut up!

01:22:14.108 --> 01:22:19.689
<i>They're Precambrian life forms.</i>
<i>How's anybody supposed to</i>
<i>research Precambrian life?</i>

01:22:19.775 --> 01:22:22.228
What difference
does it make now?

01:22:22.317 --> 01:22:26.180
We're stuck on a goddam roof
with a bunch of whatsits
trying to eat us.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:29.060
I've done this before,
and I did not like it.

01:22:29.150 --> 01:22:33.772
Okay. It's all my fault!
So things didn't work out
exactly the way we planned.

01:22:33.859 --> 01:22:36.015
If I had the right tools,
I'd finish the job!

01:22:36.109 --> 01:22:39.605
Jeez! Would you
just all relax?

01:22:39.692 --> 01:22:44.729
<i>Now, look. Nobody's</i>
<i>heard from us since last night,</i>

01:22:44.818 --> 01:22:49.558
<i>which means pretty soon</i>
<i>they're going to be up here</i>
<i>looking for us, right?</i>

01:22:49.651 --> 01:22:54.985
So all we have to do
is sit and wait. Okay?

01:22:58.735 --> 01:23:00.690
Burt?

01:23:03.902 --> 01:23:05.809
Okay.

01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:37.729
So I figured I wanted to learn
some Spanish, and six months in
Mexico would be an adventure.

01:23:42.653 --> 01:23:45.651
So, uh...

01:23:46.737 --> 01:23:48.644
Seeing anybody?

01:23:54.445 --> 01:23:57.609
Not since
the monsters arrived.

01:23:57.695 --> 01:24:02.021
Well, you know, you...

01:24:02.112 --> 01:24:05.727
spend a couple of days
almost getting killed,
you start, uh,

01:24:05.821 --> 01:24:08.025
thinking about your future
and...

01:24:08.112 --> 01:24:10.945
Thinking you
should date more?

01:24:11.029 --> 01:24:13.648
Well, uh,
yeah, actually.

01:24:15.738 --> 01:24:18.570
Uh, look, uh,

01:24:18.655 --> 01:24:22.565
I just don't meet that many
women who can keep their cool...

01:24:22.655 --> 01:24:24.692
in a situation like this.

01:24:26.530 --> 01:24:31.602
What I mean is that, uh...
What matters to me is that
a woman can handle herself.

01:24:31.697 --> 01:24:33.687
It's much more important
than what she looks like.

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:37.644
Thanks a lot.
Aw, come on!
You look great.

01:24:38.989 --> 01:24:42.568
Enough guys
have told you that.
Yeah, well.

01:24:42.655 --> 01:24:45.570
Believe it or not,
I made my living
as a model once upon a time.

01:24:45.656 --> 01:24:47.563
I put myself
through college.

01:24:47.656 --> 01:24:49.730
I believe it.
I was a...

01:24:49.822 --> 01:24:53.603
I was even a Playmate once.

01:24:53.698 --> 01:24:57.526
About gave my dad
a heart attack.

01:24:59.989 --> 01:25:03.734
What?
October '74?

01:25:03.823 --> 01:25:07.105
Shit!

01:25:13.615 --> 01:25:15.902
Yup!

01:25:16.615 --> 01:25:19.696
<i>Uh, guys. Guys!</i>

01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:23.858
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

01:25:30.324 --> 01:25:33.571
Goddam little...
heat seekers.

01:25:33.657 --> 01:25:36.739
<i>What do we do, Earl?</i>
<i>You gotta stop asking me!</i>

01:25:36.824 --> 01:25:40.356
<i>I don't know!</i>
What's goin' on?

01:25:40.449 --> 01:25:42.357
What's happening?

01:25:52.825 --> 01:25:54.732
Uh-oh.

01:25:56.783 --> 01:25:59.698
Smart little bastards.

01:25:59.783 --> 01:26:01.691
Whoa! Oh!

01:26:14.659 --> 01:26:17.361
Come get me, you suckers!
You hungry?

01:26:17.451 --> 01:26:20.402
<i>- A hundred and eighty-five</i>
<i>pounds of lean meat.</i>
- Burt, what are you doing?

01:26:20.493 --> 01:26:22.400
You know you want it!

01:26:24.493 --> 01:26:27.112
Burt!
Burt!

01:26:29.326 --> 01:26:32.277
What is wrong
with him?
Has he got a plan?

01:26:32.368 --> 01:26:35.864
Burt's always
got a plan...
usually.

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.568
Yes!

01:26:53.494 --> 01:26:55.401
Problem solved.

01:26:55.494 --> 01:26:58.860
You maniac!

01:26:58.952 --> 01:27:01.073
Who-oo!
<i>Oh, Burt,</i>
<i>you did it!</i>

01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:03.484
You tricked
the little plug uglies!

01:27:03.578 --> 01:27:06.943
How's it feel
to be so stupid?

01:27:08.995 --> 01:27:11.151
Who-oo!

01:27:13.828 --> 01:27:17.869
Oh, Christ!
Did they find something to eat?

01:27:17.953 --> 01:27:22.741
- Uh, what's in there, Kate?
- I don't know...
boxes, supplies.

01:27:22.828 --> 01:27:26.075
<i>Golosinas...</i>
<i>Dulce.</i>

01:27:26.162 --> 01:27:29.243
Hell, uh...
<i>Dulce. Dulce.</i>

01:27:29.329 --> 01:27:32.860
Sweet! <i>Golosinas...</i>
I know this one. Snack.

01:27:32.954 --> 01:27:36.485
Sweet snack food?

01:27:36.579 --> 01:27:38.700
Rice flour.

01:27:39.079 --> 01:27:42.445
I didn't know!
How could I've had known?

01:27:42.537 --> 01:27:45.073
God! Don't they
ever get tired of eating?
There'll be 100 of ‘em.

01:27:45.163 --> 01:27:47.865
Okay, we're gonna
run for it!
What?

01:27:47.954 --> 01:27:49.992
Where?
We're not gonna make it!

01:27:50.079 --> 01:27:53.575
<i>Look! Earl, I'm sorry.</i>

01:27:53.663 --> 01:27:56.412
I'm sorry I got you
all into this.
<i>Come on, Grady.</i>

01:27:56.496 --> 01:27:59.448
We ain't dead yet.

01:28:02.038 --> 01:28:04.705
Okay! Come on!

01:28:04.788 --> 01:28:06.862
Okay, what, what,
what, what, okay?

01:28:06.955 --> 01:28:09.360
Uh, I've got a plan!
Sorta.

01:28:12.955 --> 01:28:14.993
You're gonna
squirt me with this.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.114
- That's great! CO2...
It'll make you cold.
- Right. They won't see me.

01:28:18.206 --> 01:28:21.038
Says who?
No, they're right;
it oughta work.

01:28:21.122 --> 01:28:23.279
For how long?
Well, we gotta
try something!

01:28:23.372 --> 01:28:28.610
- But what is the point?
- If I can just get to your
truck, I can grab some bombs.

01:28:28.706 --> 01:28:32.368
- This is nuts!
- Well, yeah, and...

01:28:32.456 --> 01:28:34.779
Let me do it!
It was my idea!

01:28:34.873 --> 01:28:38.914
No, I got you all into this.
It's my fault.
I'm going in. Spray me!

01:28:38.998 --> 01:28:42.695
We gotta do it
before they break out.
Now, blast me!

01:28:44.123 --> 01:28:47.157
Oh, Jesus!

01:28:47.248 --> 01:28:50.163
- Yes!
- No! Rock rips through paper.

01:28:50.248 --> 01:28:54.159
Huh!
I go! Give me that shirt.
I need the gloves too.

01:28:55.957 --> 01:28:58.955
You ready?
Here goes.

01:29:16.541 --> 01:29:18.745
Man, this stuff is cold!

01:29:18.833 --> 01:29:20.788
Okay, here goes.

01:29:20.875 --> 01:29:23.707
Lock this door behind me.
Lock it?

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:27.951
<i>Yeah. I'll get the bombs</i>
<i>and go out the other door.</i>

01:29:28.042 --> 01:29:30.079
All right.

01:30:07.876 --> 01:30:10.199
Sounds like it's working.

01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:17.031
I can't see anything.
Over here.

01:30:30.044 --> 01:30:31.999
Here!

01:30:33.211 --> 01:30:35.913
Holy tamole!
There's dozens of ‘em.

01:30:36.003 --> 01:30:37.910
Good Lord.

01:30:38.003 --> 01:30:43.336
Wait a minute!
Paper wraps rock, doesn't it?

01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:46.620
Paper <i>always</i> wraps rock.

01:30:46.711 --> 01:30:48.868
Damn!

01:30:57.670 --> 01:31:00.834
He's startin' to melt!
<i>Earl, you're melting!</i>

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:04.784
Step on it!
Come on! Go, go, go!

01:31:18.171 --> 01:31:20.292
Damn! They see him.

01:31:22.046 --> 01:31:25.874
Uh... rope!
We need rope or something.

01:31:25.963 --> 01:31:29.127
Hang on, Earl!
A hose! There's a hose
down by the fire hydrant.

01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:48.537
<i>Here you go.</i>

01:31:52.672 --> 01:31:55.243
Ah! It's too short!

01:32:04.839 --> 01:32:07.542
<i>Did you hear me?</i>
<i>The hose is too short.</i>

01:32:07.631 --> 01:32:09.871
Burt, hurry!

01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:22.378
Oh!

01:32:25.049 --> 01:32:29.338
- Heads up, Earl!
Grab it! Come on!

01:32:41.257 --> 01:32:44.588
Go! Run!
Run! Go!
I set a bomb.

01:32:44.674 --> 01:32:48.005
What?
It's the only thing
I could think of.

01:32:57.508 --> 01:33:00.589
Kate, what did he do?
Grady?
Come on!

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:04.585
Where the hell are the bombs?
I didn't have time.
I just threw one in your truck.

01:33:04.675 --> 01:33:06.879
You what?

01:33:06.967 --> 01:33:10.000
That's two-and-a-half tons
of high explosives!

01:33:10.092 --> 01:33:13.256
You sayin' that's not enough?
God, Burt! Don't tell me
it's not enough!

01:33:13.342 --> 01:33:16.044
Not enough! Never mind.
Never mind. Just run!

01:33:16.134 --> 01:33:18.041
Faster!

01:33:21.592 --> 01:33:24.341
No, no, no! Keep going.
It's gonna be big.

01:33:24.426 --> 01:33:26.914
<i>Big!</i>
Is he serious?

01:33:27.009 --> 01:33:29.758
Uh, Burt knows his bombs.
How big can it be?

01:33:31.634 --> 01:33:33.839
How long did you set it for?

01:33:33.926 --> 01:33:36.759
I don't know;
I just pushed it.

01:33:36.843 --> 01:33:39.627
God, it's going to be big.
Big!

01:33:49.802 --> 01:33:55.420
All right, this will have to do.
Get down; stay down; cover
your ears. It's gonna be <i>big!</i>

01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:59.339
- Is it gonna be today?
- Grady, get your ass down!

01:34:07.553 --> 01:34:09.508
Oh!

01:34:36.012 --> 01:34:39.425
Hey, Grady. Grady.
Grady, you all right, man?

01:34:41.387 --> 01:34:43.295
You okay?

01:34:43.387 --> 01:34:46.835
Yeah. Thanks.

01:34:46.929 --> 01:34:50.425
Oh!
Watch yourselves.

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.635
Whew!

01:35:21.597 --> 01:35:24.086
Wow!

01:35:24.181 --> 01:35:26.550
Wow!

01:35:26.639 --> 01:35:31.711
You know, Grady.
Some people think
I'm overprepared.

01:35:31.806 --> 01:35:34.129
Paranoid.

01:35:34.223 --> 01:35:37.174
Maybe even
a little crazy.

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:41.128
But they never met any
Precambrian life forms,
did they?

01:35:46.265 --> 01:35:51.171
Uh, look, uh...
I don't mind hangin'
around down here for awhile.

01:35:51.265 --> 01:35:53.172
Gonna have any free time?

01:35:53.265 --> 01:35:57.969
<i>Well, spend a couple days</i>
<i>almost gettin' killed,</i>

01:35:58.057 --> 01:36:01.008
you start
thinkin' about your future.

01:36:02.682 --> 01:36:05.597
Thinkin' you
should date more?

01:36:05.682 --> 01:36:08.799
Well, yeah, actually.

01:36:08.891 --> 01:36:13.429
<i>Hey, Earl, I just realized</i>
<i>they owe us for 28 worms, man.</i>

01:36:14.516 --> 01:36:17.051
Hey, that's right.
We didn't die.

01:36:18.849 --> 01:36:21.551
Although, we did kinda
blow up their refinery.

01:36:21.641 --> 01:36:24.722
Hey, that's just
part of the job.

01:36:24.808 --> 01:36:27.640
In fact, we oughta charge them
for all those little ones too.

01:36:27.725 --> 01:36:32.299
Oh, yeah. We'll have enough
to start our own theme park...

01:36:32.391 --> 01:36:34.512
Grady and Earl's
Monster World.

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.507
Hey, no way!

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:40.013
Come on, Earl. This could
be like your big, third chance.
