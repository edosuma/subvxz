01:58.410 --> 01:59.911
Zoe.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.705
Zoe.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.957
Come on. Wake up.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.294
Someone went to bed too late, last night.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.428
- You eat them one by one? -Yes.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.722
Does they taste better?

02:20.890 --> 02:24.310
- We are late. -Are you going to pick up the pomegranate for me?

02:24.561 --> 02:26.104
You're with daddy tonight.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.149
Oh, come on, the shoes. Little feet.

02:29.315 --> 02:32.569
Oh là, là, what's going with you, they're growing every day.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.112
Come on, let's go.

02:43.288 --> 02:47.125
How is she? -She's great, she's at school.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.295
- You pick up her today, is that wright? - Of coarse, my day.

02:50.462 --> 02:53.381
- I know. - And I have her on Saturday as well.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.884
On my weekend?

02:56.051 --> 02:59.804
I have her every Saturday until the holidays because of football.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.389
Read the schedule.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.933
I did. I read wrong again.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.187
So confusing, this back and forth.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.607
That's why we have a detailed schedule in writing.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.694
- Can we talk about this next month? - What is that supposed to know?

03:14.861 --> 03:19.282
We can twist a couple of days because they
are sending me on a convention again.

03:19.449 --> 03:23.453
I don't want to discuss this on the phone.
We'll meet at the mediator next week.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.082
- But I'm gonna miss...
- We gonna finalize the custody agreement in 3 months, anyway.

03:27.248 --> 03:30.543
- I'm gonna miss days with her. - We'll talk later.

03:36.841 --> 03:40.679
Yesterday's results. Check last week.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.514
- OK. -I don't know.

03:42.681 --> 03:46.726
He has said something that the results haven't been accurate.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.437
Really? Has he read the report?

03:58.279 --> 03:59.906
Everything all right?

04:01.950 --> 04:04.828
Like I'm missing half her life.

04:22.220 --> 04:26.683
Did you quit the New York Center for Immunology yourself?

04:26.850 --> 04:29.644
- Yes. -Your results have been excellent.

04:29.811 --> 04:34.315
My husband is British.
After the birth of my daughter, we moved to London.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.359
And your American visa?

04:36.526 --> 04:39.779
I have the French and American passports.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.950
- You are not planning to move again? -We love Berlin.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.995
We moved here about 2 years ago and we intend to stay.

04:47.162 --> 04:51.041
O.k., good. You still have to speak to Prof. Wolf.

04:51.207 --> 04:54.169
He is the one making the final decision, he will be back on Tuesday.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.920
- Perfect. -Thank you.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.589
Thank you.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.844
Mom, do you know what's the best Bang?

05:03.011 --> 05:05.889
- Where do you hear the Big Bang? -At school.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.309
Yes, I love you more than the Big Bang.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.644
What's before the Big Bang, mom?

05:11.811 --> 05:13.897
Hach ... Maybe nothing.

05:14.147 --> 05:18.485
The Big Bang created time, space, matter, gravity, everything.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.321
But maybe nothing is everything.

05:21.571 --> 05:25.867
If nothing is everything, everything could be nothing.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.535
True!

05:35.168 --> 05:36.670
Sweet dreams.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.172
- Your mother loves you. -My mother loves me.

05:43.218 --> 05:46.054
Can you stay here a little more?

05:46.221 --> 05:48.807
- I'm afraid. -Afraid of what?

05:49.057 --> 05:50.892
Hairy monsters.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.353
Hairy monsters?

05:53.603 --> 05:55.230
Oh, is that one?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.899
Ooh, that is a scary one.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.069
I like to tickle you.

06:01.778 --> 06:05.490
Why did time pass so quickly when we are together?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.367
Time is relative.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.162
Einstein discovered this, but he didn't mean it that way.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.790
What he meant was ... I don't know.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.876
Time flies when we have fun.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.888
She gets another fly. It's a cat.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.933
A cat in a tuxedo with a bow tie. Here. À toi.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.601
- Cat. -Cat.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.770
- Oh ...

06:37.439 --> 06:39.774
Hey, how's my princess?

06:40.650 --> 06:42.819
- I missed you. - I missed you too daddy.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.905
- We'll have fun today. -What do we do?

06:46.072 --> 06:48.825
I thought a schedule go to snorkeling in the water park.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.119
- Oh yeah. -Yes. But before...

06:51.286 --> 06:54.247
- Where's your bag? -In your room, Zoe.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.210
Can you pick her up from school on Tuesday?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.212
Magda has a class there.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.924
- I can get it from you around 7. -Why can't you?

07:05.175 --> 07:08.219
Um ... I have an interview.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.888
In immunology.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.266
- Yah, I probably can. -Thanks.

07:13.516 --> 07:17.604
Listen, I think we should start looking for someone more reliable.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.065
Yes, I know, but Zoe likes her.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.152
Not so stormy, number 9.

07:24.319 --> 07:27.322
- What you up to? -I want to see her play.

07:27.489 --> 07:30.742
- It's my day. - From half past eleven it is only half past ten.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.952
I have read the new plan.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.706
Fine, but can you please leave at 11:30 without a drama?

07:36.873 --> 07:38.875
I can do that, I think.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.921
Good, Zoe! Come on, go on!

07:43.171 --> 07:45.256
Come on, Emily!

07:47.509 --> 07:49.010
Made super good.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.596
1, 2, 3, the.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.973
go, go, go!

08:04.442 --> 08:08.279
"How was it swimming? How's she doing? Was she having fun?"

08:15.912 --> 08:17.747
"Is everything okay?"

08:30.010 --> 08:31.511
Call James.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.433
Here is James. Please behind ...

08:39.308 --> 08:43.313
Berlin, water park, accidents today.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.942
Not a suitable event.

08:46.109 --> 08:50.155
Wasserwelt Berlin. Swim with fish ...

08:52.657 --> 08:55.326
- "Yes."

09:07.339 --> 09:08.965
- Hey. -Morning.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.343
- Where is she? -On the terrace.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.095
She has a bruise on her arm. From where?

09:14.262 --> 09:18.391
I don't know, probably from football or school.

09:18.641 --> 09:22.479
- Do you think I hurt her? -It was just a question.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.064
Oh god.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.775
- Hello, Magda. -Hey.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.401
- How are you? -Good.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.028
My kitty.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.157
We have to go. Get ready, honey.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.829
- Why is Magda here? -I have a meeting with a client.

09:39.996 --> 09:44.125
On Sunday? You should have called me instead of the babysitter.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.128
As if you weren't going to order Magda.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.339
- Not on weekends. -Sure, of course.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.550
She had a nightmare. Something with the big bang.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.637
- That was an issue at school. -OK.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.932
How was it swimming?

09:59.182 --> 10:03.269
There was a little yellow fish, Jerry, who followed me.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.814
- He was in love with her. -What else.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.858
Magda, you know, I'll pick her up tomorrow.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.360
Yes. Have a good day.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.778
Thank you, too.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.655
Oh god, she sneezes.

10:13.822 --> 10:17.742
- Did you blow dry her hair? -It was 25 degrees. Relax yourself.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.495
- I'll miss you so much. -You me too.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.997
Okay. Let’s go. We are going to be late.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.208
What are you doing today?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.211
- We are going to the zoo. -Oh yes? With who?

10:28.461 --> 10:31.089
- Uh ... only we 2. -A lot of fun.

10:31.256 --> 10:34.175
- I want to swim with Jerry. -You were just there.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.721
- I want to anyway. -Hey, don't tug on the bag.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.348
- You're nasty. -But that hurts.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.600
Come on now, march.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.937
We'll be swimming with Jerry soon, I promise.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.776
Sorry for being late.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.319
Hi.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.031
Zoe, this is Akil, an old friend.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.949
Hello, Zoe. How are you?

10:58.116 --> 11:00.118
- Good. And you? -Good.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.501
We'll try again.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.629
Look at that.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.215
- Over there. -Yes.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.552
Bonjour. Maybe they speak French.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.055
There, a Frenchman. What do we call him?

11:20.221 --> 11:21.973
- Jean Pierre. -Hey. Yesterday.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.482
Oh ...

11:30.648 --> 11:33.401
It's so cute. - That's right.

11:33.651 --> 11:36.446
They are still there, you see.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.656
What is he doing?

11:38.823 --> 11:40.367
He's looking at us.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.328
He is thinking. - Yes.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.468
Wow, the jungle.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.513
- Atchoo. -Ooh, no.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.808
I have a headache. I want some medicine

12:05.767 --> 12:09.646
Ou, ou, you don't have a fever. I know when you are better because ...

12:09.813 --> 12:12.273
- Strawberry tastes great. -Exactly. Allez, au dodo.

12:13.775 --> 12:17.737
You know my love, you should not be scared because of the big bang.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.282
- It happened 13 billion years ago. -I'm not scared.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.619
- You had a nightmare? -No, I didn't.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.037
- You sure? -Yes.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.664
Okay.

12:28.832 --> 12:32.127
Can you sing me my song? - All right.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.322
Come on.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.061
- Later we go to the playground. -Yes.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.188
You smell so good.

13:33.355 --> 13:36.024
- Love you. -Love you. Have fun.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.985
Hey. - How is she?

13:39.235 --> 13:41.571
She is at school, fine. Just a slight cold.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.199
Listen the mediator meets us today.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.742
- Today? - Ya.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.702
- What time? - 4:30

13:47.869 --> 13:52.582
Doesn't go Wednesday or Thursday? I have the afternoon off for Zoe.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.043
No, she's busy all week.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.920
What a shit.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.964
O.K. fine. I call Magda to pick her up.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.550
- Okay, see you then. -OK.

14:09.599 --> 14:15.063
"Neither party can claim additional days for business travel."

14:15.313 --> 14:17.399
It will be added to the package.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.443
Well, my job requires traveling, not his.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.363
How long have you been away in the past few months?

14:23.613 --> 14:25.281
- 4, 5 days? -9.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.701
Exactly. I was in London for a week.

14:27.951 --> 14:32.247
You only mess up the plan if you change everything.

14:32.497 --> 14:35.583
I think the scheme is satisfactory.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.837
Are you find the sentence satisfactory?

14:41.423 --> 14:43.091
Yes, it is good.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.677
Then we are done.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.430
I will send you the papers.

14:48.596 --> 14:52.267
You sign and we'll forward it to the court.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.855
Thank you. - Thank you.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.318
Have we clarified that now?

15:02.485 --> 15:06.448
You don't rest until you curtail all my rights.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.951
Why don't you give me more time after a trip?

15:10.118 --> 15:13.038
We agreed to have joint custody.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.750
I hoped that we would get along better.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.753
You hoped to have more time for yourself.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.338
That is probably absurd.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.841
I thought that was the best but I realize she misses me.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.718
She never says anything about that.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.346
- But to me. -Then don't work that much.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.098
My work, is my only income.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.685
Can't he support you? Of course not.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.937
I hope at some point you will notice

15:38.104 --> 15:41.566
how lucky you were that I never asked for anything

15:41.733 --> 15:45.695
I just want to protect her. Persistence gives security.

15:45.862 --> 15:49.532
Does that mean that Zoe doesn't feel safe with me?

15:49.699 --> 15:53.119
You are an awful human being. Awful!

15:53.286 --> 15:54.996
Are you ready?

15:58.666 --> 16:01.169
Can I walk you to the car?

16:20.939 --> 16:24.150
- You really do it. -What?

16:26.903 --> 16:29.531
Can I hug you please?

16:30.281 --> 16:31.783
James...

16:37.455 --> 16:40.750
We were so happy when we were all together.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.295
No, we weren't. James, it wasn't me.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.549
- Why did you do that? -I didn't do anything.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.634
Please, I can't breathe.

16:52.595 --> 16:56.016
Do you think it will ever get better between us?

16:56.182 --> 16:59.144
Can't we be nicer to each other for them?

16:59.310 --> 17:01.312
I only want the best for you.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.314
All right.

17:05.191 --> 17:09.029
Will you pick them up tomorrow I have a job interview.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.945
No, I have plans.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.574
You said you can.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.577
It's not working. Can't you put it off?

17:15.827 --> 17:20.623
- He's only here on this one day. -Then she just gets confused.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.877
Is that why you don't jump in?

17:24.044 --> 17:28.423
With the job, I would no longer have to travel and earn more.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.009
You see, your work always comes first.

17:31.176 --> 17:34.679
What are you talking about? I gave up everything for London.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.973
You were released in New York.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.434
It is not true and you know that.

17:39.601 --> 17:42.771
We are in Berlin for your work.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.397
Please don't make a scene.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.984
I can no longer afford the private school.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.779
It's a fantastic school and Zoe loves it.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.739
What is wrong with you

18:01.414 --> 18:02.582
- Hi. -Hi.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.126
Sorry I'm late.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.920
Has she eaten yet?

18:07.170 --> 18:10.757
She wasn't very hungry. I think she has a cold,

18:10.924 --> 18:13.176
 but she has no fever. -Hm.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.763
Hey ...

18:17.681 --> 18:19.683
Are you sleeping?

18:19.933 --> 18:22.644
I just want to watch TV.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.146
Hm ... don't eat anything?

18:25.313 --> 18:28.900
- I don't like broccoli. -You don’t like broccoli.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.445
- I can make you some pasta. -No.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.114
Okay.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.825
All right.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.869
- She is a touch warm. - Yes, she was coughing a bit.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.205
I hope it's not flu.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.124
- Okay thanks. -Okay, bye.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.876
- Bye, bye.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.409
Love of my life.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.666
Thanks for coming by.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.631
I feel terrible and Zoe is sick now.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.175
What a day.

19:35.425 --> 19:38.636
But now you are done, with that agreement.

19:38.803 --> 19:43.099
Sure.
Then every time we disagree on a vacation plant we can go to court.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.437
You know...

19:47.604 --> 19:50.482
Yesterday when we were together in the zoo

19:51.441 --> 19:54.361
It was like we were a family.

19:58.531 --> 20:02.243
I never felt that with James, it was never happy.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.163
He never trusted me as a mother

20:05.330 --> 20:07.957
I was always doing it wrong.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.586
You are a wonderful mother.

20:11.753 --> 20:15.173
Well, I don't know, but it's nice that you say that.

21:05.015 --> 21:08.268
Ah ... wake up, love.

21:08.518 --> 21:11.104
You have to go, she'll wake up soon.

21:35.378 --> 21:36.880
 Sweetie?

21:41.509 --> 21:43.011
Hey ...

21:48.224 --> 21:49.726
Zoe.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.480
Zoe! Zoe!

21:54.230 --> 21:56.358
Zoe ... -

21:57.984 --> 22:00.403
Zoe ... she is not waking up.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.072
Does she have fever?

22:02.238 --> 22:05.033
I don't think so, but she threw up.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.534
Zoe. Zoe.

22:06.785 --> 22:09.871
Zoe, baby, can you hear me? Zoe can you hear me?

22:10.121 --> 22:12.499
We get to see a doctor, okay?

22:12.749 --> 22:16.002
- Do you hear me, my love?

22:16.169 --> 22:17.671
Oh my poor darling.

22:17.921 --> 22:21.299
- They are coming. How is she? -She is not waking up.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.760
Oh my darling my darling ...

22:24.010 --> 22:26.763
My poor darling, what happens to you?

22:28.556 --> 22:29.974
Mommy is here with you.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.477
Did she hit her head?

22:32.644 --> 22:34.145
Why? What is it?

22:35.063 --> 22:37.440
I'm not sure.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.202
Hello.

22:49.452 --> 22:52.455
- What's her name? How old? -Zoe Lewis. 7.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.290
- Are you the mother? -Yes.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.960
Zoe. Zoe, can you hear me?

22:57.919 --> 23:01.715
- Any history of illness? -Nothing serious. -Allergies? -No.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.842
How long has she unconscious?

23:04.009 --> 23:07.887
She was like this, this morning. She was kind of sleepy, last night.

23:08.138 --> 23:10.640
- Vital parameters unremarkable! Access? -Yes.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.727
- Has she ever unconscious in the past? -No.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.229
Have you any painkillers or sleeping pills around the house?

23:16.479 --> 23:17.772
Sleeping pills but they are locked up.

23:18.023 --> 23:20.984
- We have to go. Finished? -What's happening?

23:21.151 --> 23:24.779
- Who was with her yesterday?
Sir, were you with your daughter? -I'm not her father.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.531
- High. -Where are we going?

23:26.781 --> 23:28.825
We are going to the Uni-clinic.

23:30.076 --> 23:33.163
James? We need to go to the emergency room with Zoe.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.999
She is not well. I don't know! I... No one knows yet!

23:36.249 --> 23:40.378
We don't know anything yet. Please meet me at the uni-clinic. Yes.

23:45.467 --> 23:50.138
Magda, it is Isabelle. Please call me as soon as you get this. Thank you.

23:50.388 --> 23:52.432
Sir, meet us at the uni-clinic.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.142
- Please meet me there. -OK.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.811
Any block to the head yesterday?

23:56.978 --> 23:59.564
- No, I don't know, I wasn't with her all day!
-Was she feeling sick last night?

23:59.814 --> 24:02.442
She had a cold and was sneezing.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.528
She didn't have a fever, so I didn't give her medication.

24:05.779 --> 24:07.864
- Should I have given her anything? -No.

24:08.031 --> 24:09.783
OK. Wake up, Zoe.

24:12.994 --> 24:16.456
Rose, this is Isabelle. Zoe's mother, yes.

24:16.706 --> 24:19.501
No, she is not coming to school. She is...

24:19.668 --> 24:22.212
Can you please find out if she fell out of
the swing of the pirate boat yesterday?

24:22.462 --> 24:25.298
Can you ask her teacher I'm waiting.

24:25.548 --> 24:28.635
- Did you take sleeping pills? -Yes why?

24:28.802 --> 24:30.679
I only collect information.

24:30.929 --> 24:35.225
Could she have fallen out of bed without you noticing?

24:35.475 --> 24:37.727
No, she was lying in her bed today.

24:37.894 --> 24:40.146
Even if I did, I would have heard them.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.357
Yes? Are you sure?

24:42.524 --> 24:45.235
Okay, thanks, I'm calling you. Thank you.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.862
She didn't fall in school.

24:48.113 --> 24:51.032
- Is that your blood pressure?

24:51.199 --> 24:53.284
- Mhm. Oxygen? -It's low.

24:53.535 --> 24:56.454
- Is your breathing okay? -Yes, she breathes.

24:56.705 --> 24:59.374
- It's too low, for a child, isn't it? -A little slow.

24:59.624 --> 25:02.669
- Would you please say what's going on? -75.

25:02.919 --> 25:05.213
Now please say what's going on!

25:05.463 --> 25:08.258
- My darling ... -Rise again.

25:10.844 --> 25:13.346
- You are fine, right? -Hm...

25:18.560 --> 25:21.104
What do we have? -Patient, 7 years old.

25:21.354 --> 25:24.399
Airways free, normal breathing, stable circulation.

25:24.607 --> 25:27.902
Heart rate only dropped to 60, now over 90.

25:28.069 --> 25:30.697
BZ normal. Pupil difference and GCS 9.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.490
Bring them to the CT.

25:32.741 --> 25:36.327
- I am the mother. -Dr. Haas. Please wait here.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.496
We have to do a CT scan.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.514
I don't understand!

25:56.765 --> 26:00.143
She was tired, but she wasn't that bad, was she?

26:00.310 --> 26:03.355
She was asleep when I came.

26:03.521 --> 26:04.731
Of coarse!

26:06.900 --> 26:09.903
James is on his way. you should go, really.

26:10.070 --> 26:12.322
Call me when you know anything, please.

26:27.545 --> 26:30.090
She has intracranial bleeding.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.093
We need  to get her to surgery as soon as possible.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.761
What happened?

26:34.928 --> 26:38.973
Since there are no injuries, it could be an aneurysm.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.935
Dr. Winter is the best surgeon here.

26:42.102 --> 26:44.312
Please sign form.

27:10.422 --> 27:13.174
What's happening? Did she say where it hurts?

27:13.341 --> 27:15.260
She is unconscious.

27:16.261 --> 27:19.597
- Where is she now? -You have to have an emergency operation.

27:19.848 --> 27:23.143
- She has intracranial bleeding. -What? What happened t her?

27:23.309 --> 27:26.354
I don't know! She didn't wake up this morning.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.275
Hye, I am the father of Zoe Lewis. She is sent to the surgery

27:30.442 --> 27:33.153
but I need to speak to the doctor in charge.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.321
Okay. Just a minute.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.117
There she is. Dr. Haas?

27:39.284 --> 27:41.995
I am the father of Zoe Lewis. Where is she?

27:42.162 --> 27:44.414
- She is already set for surgery. -Can I see her please?

27:44.581 --> 27:48.168
- The sooner we relieve the pressure is better. -I need to see her!

27:48.335 --> 27:53.048
Okay, I can understand that this is terrible difficult,
but all you can do is "wait".

27:53.214 --> 27:55.967
Okay? She is in very good hands.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.605
It's over an hour.

28:08.772 --> 28:11.858
- Can they tell us anything? -No idea.

28:12.108 --> 28:14.194
- It is Magda.

28:16.780 --> 28:17.822
Hi.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.949
No, she is not well.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.785
We are in the hospital.

28:21.951 --> 28:26.247
Did Zoe hurt in the playground yesterday? Has she...

28:29.959 --> 28:31.795
What do you mean?

28:34.005 --> 28:35.340
Okay.

28:36.341 --> 28:38.343
No no no. No Please.

28:38.510 --> 28:41.930
I'll let you know when something's happening. Bye.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.101
- What is? -I do not know either.

28:46.267 --> 28:49.479
Zoe hit her back on a bicycle, which

28:49.646 --> 28:51.022
was on the bottom of a slide.

28:51.189 --> 28:53.483
- Where on the back? -I do not know exactly.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.820
Magda didn't say anything because Zoe was fine, she didn't get cry.

28:56.986 --> 28:59.197
Why you trust Magda, she is never right.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.741
Zoe has no visible injuries,

29:01.991 --> 29:04.077
so it's probably an aneurysm.

29:04.327 --> 29:08.164
Why didn't you want a real nanny? You never listen to me!

29:08.415 --> 29:12.669
If you hadn't ask for mediation we wouldn't be
talking that because I would have been with Zoe.

29:12.919 --> 29:16.631
If you didn't want to separate it wouldn't
be any mediation in the first place.

29:25.974 --> 29:28.143
Every couple has difficult times.

29:28.309 --> 29:30.061
They work it out especially when they got a kid.

29:30.311 --> 29:34.482
Well, I offered you to go to someone to help
us and you ignored me until it was too late.

29:34.649 --> 29:37.485
And by the way not everyone goes through that anger ...

29:37.652 --> 29:38.695
Tell me about ...

29:38.945 --> 29:41.614
In 3 years there was no intimacy ...

29:41.781 --> 29:43.491
Sex? 

29:43.658 --> 29:46.286
What is wrong with you.

29:46.453 --> 29:49.831
- It matters in a relationship. -I agree.

29:50.081 --> 29:54.294
- You are the one who pushed me away.
-Do you want to do this again now? This is the proper time?

29:54.544 --> 29:59.007
It was my fault that I lost my look since the pregnancy.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.509
Do you realize how ridiculous that question is?

30:01.760 --> 30:04.596
Because you can't handle a little bit of truth?

30:04.846 --> 30:05.889
Truth?

30:06.056 --> 30:10.018
James, the way I look after Zoe was born
has nothing to do with you not touch ...

30:10.268 --> 30:12.896
You are wright, it has nothing to do but the way you look made

30:13.063 --> 30:15.231
you bitter and angry.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.692
Nothing is more unattractive.

30:17.942 --> 30:21.404
I wasn't bitter or angry, I was miserable.

30:21.571 --> 30:24.449
I had to loose my father in the same month.

30:24.616 --> 30:28.286
And when I visited him, I was a bad mother.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.372
It wasn't like that.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.332
Do you remember,

30:32.499 --> 30:36.336
what you did to me when I cried after his death?

30:36.586 --> 30:38.922
You didn't cry, you were hysterical.

30:39.172 --> 30:42.008
You were next to you, I wanted to calm you down.

30:42.175 --> 30:44.177
You wanted to calm me down?

30:44.344 --> 30:46.805
That's what you mean, Mr. Good Guy.

30:48.848 --> 30:51.851
Mr. Perfect, who is always in good shape.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.770
Hm?

31:02.070 --> 31:05.281
I realized something terrible about you

31:05.448 --> 31:07.450
after she was born.

31:07.701 --> 31:10.286
You subordinate everything to your needs.

31:10.453 --> 31:13.540
Because I wanted to work a year after giving birth?

31:13.707 --> 31:15.750
- Six months. -And if so.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.753
Should I always be dependent on you?

31:19.004 --> 31:22.424
- I was worried about Zoe. -What worries?

31:27.303 --> 31:31.766
You can't stand your partner outperforming you.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.394
- You're crazy. -You would have died sooner.

31:34.644 --> 31:35.979
Exactly, that's what I mean.

31:36.146 --> 31:40.358
I'm talking about Zoe and you about a job that doesn't go anywhere.

31:40.608 --> 31:43.445
And that I'm in the way of your career ...

31:43.611 --> 31:46.781
You were never good at anything, that's your problem.

31:47.032 --> 31:50.785
Do you know why I've been with you so long

31:51.036 --> 31:53.872
no matter how unbearable it was?

31:54.039 --> 31:56.249
Just because I love her so much.

31:56.416 --> 32:00.170
And because you ruined my confidence.

32:00.420 --> 32:03.340
But to cheat, that was enough.

32:11.222 --> 32:13.058
You are so gullible.

32:13.683 --> 32:15.268
How do you mean?

32:15.435 --> 32:16.936
He uses you.

32:17.187 --> 32:20.523
- What should he want from me? -No idea. Money.

32:20.690 --> 32:22.067
What money, please?

32:22.317 --> 32:25.779
Did he need any papers, an EU visa?

32:29.991 --> 32:34.287
I don't know, but the way he fucks me he can use me too.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.835
You are so vulgar

32:45.006 --> 32:48.927
The truth is that you've always had problems.

32:49.094 --> 32:50.929
- Oh really? -Mhm.

32:51.096 --> 32:52.972
Obviously only with you.

32:54.557 --> 32:57.477
Maybe you're just unattractive.

33:01.981 --> 33:05.694
And because of all this, Zoe is sick now, seriously ill.

33:05.860 --> 33:08.488
It has nothing to do with it.

33:10.240 --> 33:13.076
Good day. I am Dr. Winter, the surgeon.

33:13.243 --> 33:14.994
How are you?

33:15.161 --> 33:16.579
It is stable.

33:16.746 --> 33:20.500
We removed the clot and stopped the bleeding

33:20.667 --> 33:23.878
but a region of the brain has suffered increased pressure.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.297
And what exactly does that mean?

33:26.548 --> 33:31.261
That there is a possibility of permanent brain damage.

33:31.511 --> 33:35.598
The next 24 hours decide whether there will be an improvement.

33:35.765 --> 33:37.350
And whether she survives.

33:53.241 --> 33:57.495
I'm sorry, but no one is allowed to see her in the next 24 hours.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.985
In the meantime, brain pressure has dropped ...

34:29.152 --> 34:30.527
How is she doing?

34:30.779 --> 34:32.864
Your vital functions look good.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.533
- That means she gets through? -Yes.

34:37.202 --> 34:41.121
Yes, she is a healthy girl, of course that helps.

34:41.706 --> 34:43.541
Yes that's her.

34:44.167 --> 34:47.837
The only question is what life awaits you.

34:48.004 --> 34:49.964
What do you mean?

34:50.215 --> 34:54.219
The swelling was particularly massive in the motor region.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.638
She is currently in a coma.

34:56.804 --> 35:00.767
She ... will be healthy when she wakes up?

35:00.934 --> 35:03.228
You can't say that yet.

35:03.395 --> 35:07.315
Nor do we know if she will wake up soon.

35:07.565 --> 35:09.609
Or whether it still takes weeks.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.778
You have to be patient.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.474
- The work? -Yes.

35:42.392 --> 35:44.310
Just go, I'll stay with her.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.730
I'll be back at 6 p.m.

35:46.896 --> 35:49.190
Maybe you will get something to eat first.

35:52.610 --> 35:55.071
- Do you want something too? -No.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.866
You don't go before I'm back, right?

35:58.033 --> 35:59.868
Of course not.

36:54.881 --> 36:58.885
This is the worst thing you can imagine.

36:59.052 --> 37:02.305
Everything will be fine, for sure.

37:04.891 --> 37:06.976
At least she'll live.

37:18.863 --> 37:20.824
You don't have to sit around here.

37:21.074 --> 37:23.868
Of course I want to be here with you.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.997
Ah ... my mother.

37:32.168 --> 37:33.670
Hi, Mom.

37:36.381 --> 37:39.009
Should I book a hotel for you or ...

37:46.766 --> 37:50.603
Drive home and sleep a little, I'll stay here the night.

37:50.770 --> 37:53.565
No thanks, I'd rather be here.

37:53.732 --> 37:55.775
I would like to be alone with her.

37:57.402 --> 38:01.656
- You know it's my right ... -It's not about rights.

38:04.492 --> 38:06.953
I talked to the doctor again.

38:08.747 --> 38:12.792
He says the bleeding occurred mostly at night.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.461
I know.

38:18.256 --> 38:19.758
Was he with you?

38:22.677 --> 38:24.471
Don't start now.

38:25.221 --> 38:28.350
Were you too busy noticing what's going on?

38:31.436 --> 38:33.688
Maybe something happened

38:34.481 --> 38:36.608
while you slept

39:13.770 --> 39:14.854
Thank you.

39:17.732 --> 39:20.110
- How is she? -Nothing new.

39:21.194 --> 39:23.738
Can I do something for you, my dear?

39:25.949 --> 39:27.158
I'm sorry.

39:31.246 --> 39:32.872
Is okay.

39:37.544 --> 39:40.171
Where have you been in the middle of the night

39:42.090 --> 39:43.591
I was here.

39:44.759 --> 39:47.012
No, I mean Monday night.

39:47.804 --> 39:49.556
I was with you.

39:49.806 --> 39:53.268
You left our bed at night. Where have you been?

39:57.647 --> 40:01.735
Something happened to her head, nobody knows what.

40:12.495 --> 40:13.997
Please excuse me.

41:00.210 --> 41:02.420
She opened her eyes briefly.

41:02.587 --> 41:05.799
She tried to talk and pressed my hand.

41:05.965 --> 41:08.510
- Darling ... - Diazepam, one milligram.

41:10.762 --> 41:13.473
Hold on tight, it's getting a little stronger now.

41:13.723 --> 41:16.101
- What about her? -A seizure.

41:16.267 --> 41:18.603
She is still in a coma.

41:18.853 --> 41:20.855
Pay attention to her neck.

41:26.945 --> 41:31.074
Some patients have seizures, they appear in clusters.

41:31.241 --> 41:33.576
This indicates damage.

41:35.995 --> 41:39.082
Sign up if you have any questions, yes?

41:39.249 --> 41:40.750
Thank you.

41:56.433 --> 41:59.561
By the way, this has arrived for you today.

42:00.562 --> 42:02.188
Probably the ...

42:02.355 --> 42:05.400
Custody agreement to sign.

42:19.164 --> 42:22.250
You should go home and rest.

42:22.417 --> 42:24.419
I hold the position here.

42:26.713 --> 42:28.214
James?

43:19.224 --> 43:22.769
- Hello, Magda. What is it? -I am Anna, her mother.

43:23.937 --> 43:25.438
Hi.

43:26.356 --> 43:28.108
How is zoe

43:28.858 --> 43:32.404
You read the message yes, she is not well.

43:32.570 --> 43:34.406
Tell her.

43:35.949 --> 43:38.159
Will she get better?

43:40.495 --> 43:42.622
We do not know that.

43:45.417 --> 43:46.918
Tell her.

43:48.378 --> 43:50.171
I'm sorry, you ...

43:53.091 --> 43:56.928
Zo ... Zoe hit his head on the slide.

43:58.555 --> 44:00.223
She was a little dizzy

44:00.390 --> 44:03.560
but I didn’t think she did anything.

44:06.730 --> 44:09.274
I'm really sincerely sorry.

44:36.801 --> 44:38.762
Maybe you can bring them to justice.

44:38.928 --> 44:43.141
At best, you can forbid her to work with children again.

44:43.308 --> 44:45.852
I would be to the hospital with her immediately.

44:46.019 --> 44:49.022
How could you escape that she was missing something?

44:49.189 --> 44:51.358
I thought she had the flu.

44:51.524 --> 44:54.736
It's my fault. I should have protected her.

44:54.903 --> 44:57.822
No, it's up to me. It's just my fault!

44:57.989 --> 45:01.242
I would have picked her up from school on Monday!

45:19.135 --> 45:24.557
Unfortunately, the new CT shows that a rare complication has occurred.

45:24.724 --> 45:27.310
Cerebral sinus vein thrombosis.

45:27.560 --> 45:30.563
- What is that supposed to be? An infection? -No.

45:30.814 --> 45:33.483
It has nothing to do with infection.

45:33.733 --> 45:37.946
We'll dissolve your blood clot with medication, but ...

45:38.905 --> 45:40.824
the EEG does not look good.

45:41.991 --> 45:43.493
Can you see it,

45:43.660 --> 45:46.955
after the hemorrhage has this new complication

45:47.122 --> 45:49.749
led to even deeper damage.

45:50.500 --> 45:54.212
There is very little brain activity at the moment.

45:57.716 --> 45:59.551
Could that change?

46:01.094 --> 46:04.055
That is, uh ... unlikely.

46:06.391 --> 46:08.309
I am sincerely sorry.

46:16.317 --> 46:18.737
- Lord Lewis?

46:20.363 --> 46:21.865
Mr. Lewis?

46:38.590 --> 46:41.426
Should I bring you something from below?

46:41.593 --> 46:43.303
Just a water. Thank you.

46:50.435 --> 46:54.731
I promise we'll go visit Jerry the fish again.

46:56.649 --> 46:59.152
- It's so pretty, isn't it? -Yes.

47:01.112 --> 47:04.783
I like her hair color so much, the freckles.

47:04.949 --> 47:08.912
And it's so funny, the way it sees the world.

47:09.704 --> 47:12.290
Look at her face, so cute.

47:19.047 --> 47:21.883
- Everything OK? -Excuse me.

47:36.690 --> 47:38.149
Mom.

47:47.617 --> 47:49.327
Little angel.

47:55.166 --> 47:59.879
The latest investigations unfortunately confirmed my suspicions.

48:00.046 --> 48:02.173
There is no brain activity.

48:04.968 --> 48:06.845
We can keep them here

48:07.721 --> 48:12.392
for a while, but eventually her condition will deteriorate ...

48:15.854 --> 48:18.023
I know it's not easy.

48:19.441 --> 48:23.778
And there is no good time to raise the issue.

48:23.945 --> 48:24.988
But...

48:26.031 --> 48:29.868
I want you both ... to think about something.

48:33.246 --> 48:37.417
Take your time, please, as much time as you need.

48:39.044 --> 48:43.715
We have a team here that can assist you with any questions.

48:50.680 --> 48:53.183
We have a lot of little children here

48:53.600 --> 48:55.185
in Zoes Alter,

48:56.728 --> 48:58.229
they are waiting.

48:59.356 --> 49:02.400
Without knowing if they will survive the year

49:02.567 --> 49:05.528
because they need a heart or a kidney.

49:06.363 --> 49:07.864
Or...

49:19.167 --> 49:21.961
- What did he say? -He wants her kidneys.

49:25.507 --> 49:28.093
I'll clean it up.

49:29.260 --> 49:32.555
- What are you doing? -The bag fell off.

49:32.806 --> 49:34.891
- I'll clean it up. - She's freezing.

49:35.058 --> 49:37.143
- It doesn't freeze. -Why not?

49:37.936 --> 49:39.688
It is ... It is not ...

49:39.854 --> 49:41.815
Cover them up!

49:48.113 --> 49:50.532
My poor darling ...

50:06.756 --> 50:09.175
- What can we do? -Nothing at all.

50:09.426 --> 50:11.886
You know some of the best doctors, don't you?

50:12.053 --> 50:15.890
I talked to neurologists in Paris, New York, London.

50:16.641 --> 50:18.309
She is brain dead.

50:18.560 --> 50:21.146
I should never have listened to the doctors

50:21.396 --> 50:23.982
who said Bertrand could not be saved.

50:24.232 --> 50:27.277
Mom, the therapies were torture for Dad.

50:27.444 --> 50:30.405
It would have been exactly the same elsewhere.

50:30.572 --> 50:32.574
But you always said

50:32.741 --> 50:36.578
if there is no hope left, you have to keep going.

50:38.079 --> 50:40.331
- I wouldn't give up. -Mom

50:40.999 --> 50:43.084
Think an Marie Curie.

50:43.335 --> 50:47.130
She fought even when her life was at stake.

50:47.297 --> 50:49.924
But it's not about Marie Curie.

50:50.675 --> 50:53.261
This is about Zoe and she's dead.

50:54.095 --> 50:55.347
She is dead.

50:55.597 --> 50:58.058
Listen to your heart, Isabelle.

51:00.643 --> 51:02.228
Keep your mouth shut!

51:03.104 --> 51:05.690
It's not about listening to your heart

51:05.857 --> 51:08.485
or karma nonsense, it's about neurology.

51:08.735 --> 51:11.404
It was wrong to raise you in France.

51:11.571 --> 51:14.991
- Like your father, you don't believe in anything. -Yes.

51:15.992 --> 51:17.952
I'm sorry, sorry.

51:18.119 --> 51:22.123
I'll take you to your hotel, I can't do that now.

52:29.733 --> 52:33.862
I cannot sign the consent to donate organs.

52:57.719 --> 52:59.721
My princess.

55:25.200 --> 55:28.495
"Dr. Fischer's research goes too far for the EU."

56:05.532 --> 56:08.785
Hey ... you don't answer the phone.

56:09.828 --> 56:11.579
I know your mother ...

56:11.830 --> 56:14.999
Everyone is panicking, telling miracle stories,

56:15.166 --> 56:17.127
I can not handle this.

56:17.293 --> 56:21.131
I didn't see you in the hospital, where were you?

56:21.381 --> 56:23.008
- Can I ... -No.

56:26.469 --> 56:27.971
Is he there?

56:31.933 --> 56:34.519
Not even that stops you.

56:34.686 --> 56:36.021
Worth...

56:36.187 --> 56:40.275
Do you think signing the statement was easy for me?

56:45.155 --> 56:49.284
When I was in the hospital, her blood tests came.

56:50.827 --> 56:52.662
Your kidneys are not ...

56:54.414 --> 56:57.709
In any case, they can no longer be donated.

56:57.876 --> 57:00.378
But if you sign now

57:00.545 --> 57:04.132
then at least part of her will be able to live on.

57:04.299 --> 57:06.926
Sorry, I know it sounds ...

57:08.178 --> 57:10.180
I will sign tomorrow.

57:40.377 --> 57:42.796
I will be traveling for a few days.

57:42.962 --> 57:44.464
Where?

57:46.049 --> 57:49.469
In case it takes longer, will you wait?

57:52.055 --> 57:53.723
I'm here.

57:54.849 --> 57:58.478
I love you and everything that goes with it.

58:01.648 --> 58:03.316
I love you too.

58:22.877 --> 58:26.423
Can I be alone with her one last time, please?

58:27.257 --> 58:29.175
Naturally.

01:00:28.294 --> 01:00:30.088
Love of my life.

01:00:41.016 --> 01:00:44.227
Isabelle, you're doing the right thing.

01:00:44.394 --> 01:00:45.895
I know.

01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:04.831
Isabelle?

01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:15.800
The doctor says she fell asleep peacefully.

01:01:15.967 --> 01:01:18.261
Can i see her room Sorry?

01:01:34.903 --> 01:01:36.654
Are you planning to leave?

01:01:37.572 --> 01:01:40.742
- Only a day away from the city. -Really?

01:01:40.992 --> 01:01:43.244
I'll be back in 24 hours.

01:01:43.411 --> 01:01:47.332
Nobody can understand what a beautiful child she was.

01:01:47.499 --> 01:01:50.460
What a terrible loss that is.

01:01:52.962 --> 01:01:55.298
We need each other, Isabelle.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.474
- Why are you leaving? -What professional.

01:02:04.724 --> 01:02:07.310
What? Do you just move on to the agenda?

01:02:10.939 --> 01:02:13.358
Ms. Perrault? Cryo shipping.

01:02:13.525 --> 01:02:16.403
Can you wait 10 minutes for the papers?

01:02:16.569 --> 01:02:18.071
- No problem. -Thank you.

01:02:18.321 --> 01:02:21.991
I have to work and you make it complicated.

01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:25.537
I'm not in the way of your idiotic career.

01:02:25.787 --> 01:02:29.082
I just thought we would help each other to let them go.

01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:31.251
I will never let go of her.

01:02:35.797 --> 01:02:37.507
What do you think of?

01:02:37.757 --> 01:02:40.051
If you don't go away immediately ...

01:02:40.218 --> 01:02:42.429
- What's this? -I'm calling the police.

01:02:42.679 --> 01:02:44.431
- These are samples. -What's this?

01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:46.683
- What is it? -These are your cells!

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:48.685
Don't open that!

01:02:57.736 --> 01:02:59.738
I’m sorry, Isabelle.

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:38.443
Hi.

01:03:41.571 --> 01:03:43.281
To Moscow Plaza please.

01:04:16.731 --> 01:04:20.985
- Have the samples arrived? -Yes, they arrived this morning.

01:04:21.152 --> 01:04:22.487
- Good. -Dr. Perrault?

01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:24.531
Dr. Fischer, nice to see you again.

01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:26.449
Come. Where have we met?

01:04:26.616 --> 01:04:30.120
From Berlin. The conference for stem cells and immunology.

01:04:30.286 --> 01:04:31.371
Ah yes, that's right.

01:04:31.621 --> 01:04:33.331
- Thank you. -Where do you live?

01:04:33.498 --> 01:04:35.792
In the Moscow Plaza, very close.

01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:39.129
- Courageous to come to the land of evil. -By you too.

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:41.673
Science demands a price.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.677
Women should have a choice about when they want to become mothers.

01:04:45.927 --> 01:04:50.223
- Then you're a feminist. - I've never looked at it like this.

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:52.350
So what can I do for you?

01:04:52.517 --> 01:04:56.229
The Pasteur Institute asks you to clone a rhesus monkey.

01:04:56.396 --> 01:04:59.607
He had complete immunity to the H5N1 virus.

01:04:59.774 --> 01:05:01.401
- Do you know the cost? -Yes.

01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:05.071
You want to know beforehand whether the cells are intact.

01:05:05.321 --> 01:05:07.449
Is the monkey not available?

01:05:07.615 --> 01:05:10.618
A breakdown. The animal died and was burned.

01:05:10.869 --> 01:05:15.123
You came to the result after studying your files.

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.208
There is only one biopsy.

01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:19.169
Damn damage.

01:05:19.419 --> 01:05:23.757
- We are so close to a vaccine. -Okay. I will call you tomorrow.

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:28.762
The institute should know today whether the cells could be cloned.

01:05:28.928 --> 01:05:33.600
Understand. Then I would have to go to the laboratory now.
It will take a while.

01:05:34.392 --> 01:05:36.102
Thank you.

01:05:55.997 --> 01:05:57.999
Thank you very much.

01:06:14.974 --> 01:06:18.395
Dr. Perrault? Dr. Fischer would like to see you.

01:06:26.695 --> 01:06:29.948
The first rhesus monkey with 23 pairs of chromosomes.

01:06:31.741 --> 01:06:34.369
Take that and go.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:38.289
Who should I clone and why?

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:42.168
- Are the cells intact? -Yes, but I want an answer.

01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:45.005
- Who sends you here? -Nobody.

01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:48.425
It's about my daughter.

01:06:48.591 --> 01:06:51.803
She died of a brain injury two days ago.

01:06:55.015 --> 01:06:57.017
I am truly sorry.

01:06:57.642 --> 01:07:01.312
But human cloning is illegal and unethical.

01:07:01.563 --> 01:07:04.232
What you read about me is not true.

01:07:04.482 --> 01:07:09.154
They clone embryos for in vitro fertilization and come with ethics.

01:07:09.404 --> 01:07:13.324
It's something else, it's about embryonic reproduction.

01:07:13.575 --> 01:07:17.203
They're not copies of dead people, they're twins.

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:21.041
Do you see the difference and how wrong is your concern?

01:07:21.207 --> 01:07:24.002
It may seem wrong to clone a dead child

01:07:24.169 --> 01:07:26.463
but it's not an abnormal experiment.

01:07:26.713 --> 01:07:29.341
There is something abnormal in its nature.

01:07:29.507 --> 01:07:34.012
It is hardly feasible, endless complications can arise.

01:07:34.262 --> 01:07:37.182
Cloning has been practiced for over a decade.

01:07:37.432 --> 01:07:40.602
Single cells, no implantable embryo.

01:07:42.896 --> 01:07:46.608
I cloned this dog. He was only one month old.

01:07:46.858 --> 01:07:50.653
A tumor destroyed his skull. Do you want that for your daughter?

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:53.615
What was the cause of death of the first dog?

01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:55.200
A cancer.

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:57.827
His cells were cancerous.

01:07:57.994 --> 01:08:01.414
My Zoe was very healthy. She would have been very old.

01:08:01.664 --> 01:08:04.209
You know it's not that easy.

01:08:04.376 --> 01:08:07.962
I know all the risks, but I know we have gotten better.

01:08:08.129 --> 01:08:10.757
It's just not done, officially

01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:13.009
for fear of law enforcement.

01:08:13.259 --> 01:08:16.763
Or just nobody knows how to make a profit from it?

01:08:17.013 --> 01:08:19.265
How do you want to afford it?

01:08:19.432 --> 01:08:21.393
I will find a way.

01:08:21.643 --> 01:08:25.145
You want me to fulfill your wealthy fantasy.

01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:28.649
There are countless orphans who need a mother.

01:08:28.817 --> 01:08:32.862
War and natural disasters give you free choice.

01:08:33.113 --> 01:08:36.241
I hadn't expected so much cynicism from you.

01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:40.662
You have First World Syndrome when you see children as goods.

01:08:40.828 --> 01:08:42.412
Children die everywhere.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:47.627
Is that why mothers come here and ask me to clone their children?

01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:52.549
A mother who loses her child against the world's misery ...

01:08:52.716 --> 01:08:55.301
I don't feel guilt, just pain.

01:08:55.468 --> 01:08:57.761
Where I come from doesn't matter.

01:08:57.929 --> 01:09:02.142
Or maybe it is, and that's unfair. I can have this dream.

01:09:02.392 --> 01:09:05.478
I also know that it is not impossible.

01:09:05.645 --> 01:09:07.814
Even if the chances are slim,

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:11.901
I won't give up until I've tried everything

01:09:13.361 --> 01:09:16.197
I'm sorry, I ... I can't do it.

01:09:16.363 --> 01:09:19.408
It violates my ethical principles.

01:09:19.576 --> 01:09:21.286
It's also too risky.

01:09:21.536 --> 01:09:24.747
- No one knows about it except us. -No.

01:09:24.997 --> 01:09:27.709
Many employees would be involved.

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:29.711
I could lose everything.

01:09:29.877 --> 01:09:31.921
You wouldn't lose everything.

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:36.051
Losing everything is different.

01:09:37.469 --> 01:09:39.804
Incidentally, it does not exist in any culture

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:43.350
a word for a parent who has lost a child.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.354
There are orphans, widows, but if you lose your child, not a word.

01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:54.944
I wish I was never born.

01:09:56.905 --> 01:09:58.990
I wish there was no air

01:09:59.157 --> 01:10:03.244
no ocean, no trees, no light.

01:10:17.676 --> 01:10:20.303
We were in Paris 2 years ago.

01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:33.108
I cannot bring the dead back.

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.487
When we met, it seemed

01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:41.783
They wanted more than money through in vitro fertilization for women

01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:44.869
of tyrants and corrupt business people.

01:10:45.036 --> 01:10:47.247
I am sincerely sorry.

01:10:48.289 --> 01:10:52.127
It must be insanely difficult for you, I understand you well.

01:10:52.293 --> 01:10:55.380
I can help you have another child.

01:10:55.547 --> 01:10:57.590
How old are you 45?

01:10:58.299 --> 01:11:02.846
It would be easy to do. Gen editing corrects all errors.

01:11:03.013 --> 01:11:04.556
I know.

01:11:05.682 --> 01:11:08.309
But I don't want another child.

01:11:16.818 --> 01:11:18.319
Stop it.

01:11:18.903 --> 01:11:20.613
Stop, I said!

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.282
What is wrong with you?

01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:29.914
- God, why are you so irritable? -There's something stuck.

01:11:33.626 --> 01:11:36.338
What's so funny here?

01:11:36.588 --> 01:11:38.506
- Come on, tell me. -No.

01:11:38.757 --> 01:11:41.343
Why not? Is it a secret?

01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:45.722
You can tell me. - Better not. No.

01:11:47.057 --> 01:11:49.225
Don't you wanna say what's going on?

01:11:49.392 --> 01:11:51.311
- Ah, nothing at all. -Really?

01:11:51.561 --> 01:11:53.313
I won't buy you.

01:11:55.023 --> 01:11:56.232
Also?

01:11:56.483 --> 01:12:00.653
I met an immunologist I know from a conference.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.365
It wasn't a monkey she wanted to clone.

01:12:03.531 --> 01:12:05.950
Oh my goodness. What did she want?

01:12:06.201 --> 01:12:07.660
An army of your own?

01:12:07.827 --> 01:12:11.081
She wanted to clone the child she just lost.

01:12:11.247 --> 01:12:12.791
That's crazy.

01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:14.876
People are really crazy.

01:12:15.126 --> 01:12:17.962
- At the same time, she is a scientist. -Exactly.

01:12:18.129 --> 01:12:19.964
You should know better.

01:12:28.765 --> 01:12:29.808
Hi?

01:12:29.974 --> 01:12:31.685
- Here is Dr. Fisherman. -Yes?

01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:34.604
I still have your daughter's photo here.

01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:38.608
- Yes ... the photo. - Can you come over?

01:12:38.858 --> 01:12:42.070
- Well, I'm waiting for you in the foyer. -Is good. See you.

01:12:46.658 --> 01:12:48.410
Please don't look at me like that.

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.454
I'm just trying to read your mind

01:12:51.621 --> 01:12:53.164
This is not possible.

01:13:09.222 --> 01:13:12.142
I didn't want you to leave without that.

01:13:12.308 --> 01:13:14.227
- Thank you. -Is it going to Berlin?

01:13:14.894 --> 01:13:16.730
No, first somewhere else.

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:20.233
Find an unscrupulous doctor to do it?

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.443
And.

01:13:22.819 --> 01:13:25.363
Please take our cryo shipping.

01:13:25.613 --> 01:13:29.159
Thanks, I have one. It would also be too risky for you.

01:13:29.325 --> 01:13:31.911
Not as long as we don't clone anything.

01:13:33.371 --> 01:13:35.206
Good luck.

01:13:35.457 --> 01:13:38.918
Incidentally, you were wrong, I checked.

01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:42.213
There's a Hebrew word for a parent

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:45.216
that his child loses. Probably because of the age of the language.

01:13:45.467 --> 01:13:48.762
Losing a child was normal at the time.

01:13:50.722 --> 01:13:53.683
It won't work, you know that.

01:13:53.933 --> 01:13:58.646
10,000.

01:13:58.897 --> 01:14:02.734
Then it is still unlikely that you can discharge it.

01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:05.487
They would have nothing but grief and suffering.

01:14:05.737 --> 01:14:08.406
I'm not afraid of that.

01:14:09.115 --> 01:14:11.284
You will not have enough money.

01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:14.746
Then I look for something where I can do it myself.

01:14:14.913 --> 01:14:17.123
Is that really your wish?

01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:19.959
Clone your own daughter?

01:14:20.126 --> 01:14:22.879
Do you have any moral concerns?

01:14:23.963 --> 01:14:25.006
No.

01:14:25.256 --> 01:14:28.093
You make yourself an experiment.

01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:34.224
Nobody knows who or what arises from it and could be terrible.

01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:35.684
I know.

01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:40.980
- see you again - see you again

01:15:07.465 --> 01:15:10.844
It would be absolutely insane if you were successful.

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:18.518
You will be admitted as an IVF patient.

01:15:18.768 --> 01:15:20.854
The hormone treatment starts tomorrow.

01:15:21.104 --> 01:15:23.356
And we need other eggs, many.

01:15:23.606 --> 01:15:28.153
That would be expensive, but I will probably think of something.

01:15:32.657 --> 01:15:34.284
Plan a lot of time.

01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:24.542
Multiple follicles. They respond well to treatment.

01:17:01.705 --> 01:17:04.833
Embryos developed from 2 of the 62 egg cells.

01:17:04.999 --> 01:17:07.919
One is good, the other satisfactory.

01:17:08.169 --> 01:17:11.506
Interestingly, these eggs were your own.

01:17:11.673 --> 01:17:14.342
Has the donor egg become nothing?

01:17:14.509 --> 01:17:15.552
No.

01:17:15.719 --> 01:17:20.473
Your uterine lining is too thin, so keep taking hormones.

01:17:21.349 --> 01:17:24.602
Next week we will use the embryo.

01:17:24.853 --> 01:17:29.190
Everything looks good. Stay there for half an hour.

01:17:29.357 --> 01:17:32.944
We'll keep you here to monitor implantation.

01:17:33.111 --> 01:17:35.822
Since it's not a regular pregnancy,

01:17:35.989 --> 01:17:39.784
mutations and anomalies can always occur.

01:17:39.951 --> 01:17:41.995
It is just an attempt.

01:17:53.256 --> 01:17:54.758
Hey.

01:17:55.592 --> 01:17:57.761
It looks beautiful.

01:17:57.927 --> 01:18:00.388
I spoke to Anton.

01:18:01.556 --> 01:18:02.599
And?

01:18:02.766 --> 01:18:05.226
You promised never to do anything like that.

01:18:05.393 --> 01:18:07.270
Anton shouldn't have said anything.

01:18:07.437 --> 01:18:09.773
He worries what could threaten you.

01:18:09.939 --> 01:18:11.858
If he unpacks, I'm done.

01:18:11.983 --> 01:18:14.569
Only 4 people know it, now 5.

01:18:14.736 --> 01:18:16.613
It is too late to stop.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.239
- Is she already ... -Yes.

01:18:18.406 --> 01:18:21.409
Why are you doing this? You said it was wrong.

01:18:21.659 --> 01:18:25.497
Each case stands for itself. Who are we to decide that?

01:18:25.747 --> 01:18:28.666
- But you made your decision. -Looks like.

01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:32.587
I think it is justified in this particular case.

01:18:35.465 --> 01:18:37.050
Do you love me laura

01:18:37.676 --> 01:18:40.595
No, not enough for a life on the run

01:18:40.762 --> 01:18:44.057
just because you have to be the first in everything.

01:18:44.307 --> 01:18:48.144
- You should get to know them. -You speculate on pity.

01:18:48.311 --> 01:18:50.730
If you go on like this, I'll leave you.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:53.191
We already had to move here.

01:18:53.358 --> 01:18:55.276
Where do we want to go now?

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:59.614
- Mars? -That's not funny.

01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:14.170
Do you know what that is?

01:19:15.213 --> 01:19:16.631
Your heart.

01:19:16.798 --> 01:19:19.634
Just a couple of cells, but it is already beating.

01:19:22.554 --> 01:19:25.515
- Moment. Can i see her again -Naturally.

01:19:34.858 --> 01:19:37.694
Hello, my name is Isabelle. Am i early

01:19:37.986 --> 01:19:40.238
No, Thomas is too late, as always.

01:19:40.405 --> 01:19:42.157
- Come in. -For her.

01:19:42.407 --> 01:19:44.951
Get it, you have to be hungry.

01:19:45.118 --> 01:19:48.621
All the time. I'm hungry for everything Russian.

01:19:48.872 --> 01:19:51.416
Pickled cucumbers, herring, cabbage soup.

01:19:53.084 --> 01:19:56.129
Dr. Fischer, I mean Thomas, he told me

01:19:56.296 --> 01:19:58.381
Do you illustrate children's books?

01:19:58.548 --> 01:20:00.342
- Yes. -That is wonderful.

01:20:01.676 --> 01:20:03.470
Are you here with your husband?

01:20:03.636 --> 01:20:06.222
No, Zoe's father and I live separately.

01:20:06.389 --> 01:20:09.267
I met a wonderful man

01:20:09.434 --> 01:20:12.771
but I decided to do this on my own.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:16.900
Frankly, I am not enthusiastic about it.

01:20:17.025 --> 01:20:18.860
I know.

01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:21.112
That's why I'm here.

01:20:23.448 --> 01:20:25.116
- You have sons? -2.

01:20:25.367 --> 01:20:27.660
- And how old? -7 and 6.

01:20:27.827 --> 01:20:29.621
You are with friends.

01:20:29.788 --> 01:20:32.957
I thought it would be inappropriate if they were here.

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:35.794
No, I understand that, it's clear.

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:38.004
I...

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.757
I can see Zoe's face.

01:20:40.924 --> 01:20:43.426
I still remember her voice

01:20:43.593 --> 01:20:45.804
how your skin feels.

01:20:47.764 --> 01:20:49.891
No longer because of their smell.

01:20:52.435 --> 01:20:54.020
It is completely gone.

01:20:54.646 --> 01:20:58.274
If I smelled her little head

01:20:58.525 --> 01:21:03.113
while I was telling or reading something, I forgot everything else.

01:21:03.279 --> 01:21:05.323
It was so easy and wonderful.

01:21:06.449 --> 01:21:10.495
But even if it works, it still wouldn't be them.

01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:17.293
Her hair color, her smile,

01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:20.088
even their likes and dislikes,

01:21:20.255 --> 01:21:23.049
that's all set in our cells.

01:21:23.299 --> 01:21:27.178
It is confirmed again and again the more research is done about it.

01:21:27.345 --> 01:21:31.850
I just want to ... smell her little head again.

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.936
women talk?

01:21:36.187 --> 01:21:37.814
And.

01:21:53.496 --> 01:21:56.750
The backbone is well formed, everything is there.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.337
2 hands, 2 feet, one head.

01:22:03.048 --> 01:22:06.426
By the way, we have now managed 12 weeks.

01:22:06.676 --> 01:22:08.219
12 weeks and 2 days.

01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:13.558
Nice that you called, it's very lonely.

01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:16.686
It wasn't easy after we moved here.

01:22:16.936 --> 01:22:19.898
This language ... But I have the boys.

01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:23.109
- They keep you busy. -That's an understatement.

01:22:23.276 --> 01:22:25.862
- They are very sweet. -Yes, if you want.

01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:30.742
But usually they just argue. You don't give me a quiet minute.

01:22:30.909 --> 01:22:32.619
It was never silent with Zoe.

01:22:32.869 --> 01:22:35.622
She always called, talked, sang.

01:22:35.789 --> 01:22:38.416
And when she sleeps, she snores loudly.

01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:40.251
This is funny.

01:22:41.586 --> 01:22:45.882
Do you also love kissing their little heads when they sleep?

01:22:46.132 --> 01:22:49.427
They can only be kissed when they are sick.

01:22:49.594 --> 01:22:50.804
The same with Zoe.

01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:54.557
I like it when she has a cold, then she wants to cuddle.

01:22:54.808 --> 01:22:57.519
Boys are very attached to their mother, right?

01:22:57.769 --> 01:22:59.145
And.

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:03.858
I think it's great with a girl, she is full of energy and focused.

01:23:04.025 --> 01:23:07.987
She can spend hours on something, building things.

01:23:08.154 --> 01:23:11.074
Definitely from her father. He is an architect.

01:23:12.158 --> 01:23:13.910
That sounds good.

01:23:14.744 --> 01:23:18.665
You can call at any time if you need to.

01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:21.501
Thank you.

01:23:25.672 --> 01:23:27.716
You seem to get along.

01:23:27.882 --> 01:23:29.759
- That's up to you. -What.

01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:36.224
Isabelle...

01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:42.981
- How are you? -Good.

01:23:44.024 --> 01:23:45.608
May I come inside?

01:23:47.152 --> 01:23:50.238
I don't want to argue, I'm not angry ...

01:23:50.488 --> 01:23:52.407
I know what you are going through.

01:23:53.533 --> 01:23:56.036
Maybe my behavior was wrong.

01:23:56.202 --> 01:23:58.455
- I've changed. -What do you want?

01:23:59.789 --> 01:24:03.251
What you are doing here does not suit you.

01:24:05.503 --> 01:24:09.299
You are a different person from the death of your father.

01:24:09.549 --> 01:24:14.095
I wanted to help, but you pushed me away and I got angry.

01:24:14.346 --> 01:24:18.183
- Then was it my fault? -I haven't done anything wrong.

01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:21.853
Who of us thinks we can control everything?

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:24.731
What you're up to is crazy and pointless.

01:24:24.981 --> 01:24:27.233
You tell me I'm crazy?

01:24:27.484 --> 01:24:30.445
I just want to tell you that I'm sorry.

01:24:32.989 --> 01:24:35.700
It was not my intention to hurt you.

01:24:37.952 --> 01:24:40.705
I wish you could forgive me.

01:24:40.872 --> 01:24:43.792
I am partly responsible for all of this.

01:24:43.958 --> 01:24:48.338
But I was so angry and wanted to hurt you,
as a woman and as a mother.

01:24:51.007 --> 01:24:52.634
I have to go.

01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:55.261
You can't just forget about Zoe.

01:24:55.428 --> 01:24:57.681
You live in a fantasy world.

01:24:58.306 --> 01:25:00.934
We have to deal with it together.

01:25:01.184 --> 01:25:03.311
- Are you ready? -Come to Berlin.

01:25:03.561 --> 01:25:05.438
- I can not. -You're welcome.

01:25:11.986 --> 01:25:13.947
You have to stop it.

01:25:14.114 --> 01:25:15.824
I can not.

01:25:16.449 --> 01:25:19.911
You have no right to do that. She was also my child.

01:25:26.042 --> 01:25:28.294
You must not! Do you hear?

01:26:39.574 --> 01:26:41.242
We try again?

01:26:41.493 --> 01:26:42.952
Isabelle...

01:26:43.203 --> 01:26:46.289
You still have the other embryo.

01:26:46.539 --> 01:26:49.709
Well, we're starting in a couple of weeks.

01:26:49.959 --> 01:26:53.046
- You need to recover first. -Yes.

01:26:58.134 --> 01:27:00.762
- How many embryos are left? -One.

01:27:01.763 --> 01:27:03.890
Thomas...

01:27:04.766 --> 01:27:07.686
2, but one from a donor egg.

01:27:07.852 --> 01:27:11.815
Do you want to save one of their eggs for an experiment?

01:27:12.816 --> 01:27:16.820
You realize that every day the likelihood increases

01:27:16.986 --> 01:27:18.655
that you end up in prison?

01:27:18.822 --> 01:27:20.907
We all end up in prison.

01:27:21.074 --> 01:27:24.077
Maybe you should think about it.

01:27:35.755 --> 01:27:38.466
You should stay at least 6 months

01:27:38.633 --> 01:27:40.927
if you can set that up.

01:27:41.094 --> 01:27:44.556
- I can set it up. -I think that makes sense.

01:27:44.723 --> 01:27:46.933
Yes. -Okay.

01:28:09.664 --> 01:28:11.916
I hope you know what you are doing.

01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:53.833
We're going to do another blood test

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.379
but I'm afraid you lost it again.

01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:04.344
Can't you clone which of the somatic cells?

01:29:04.594 --> 01:29:06.096
That does not work.

01:29:06.346 --> 01:29:10.266
What about the cells of the dead embryo?

01:29:11.184 --> 01:29:12.977
I can't do anything else.

01:29:19.275 --> 01:29:20.777
I'm sorry.

01:29:49.305 --> 01:29:50.807
How is she doing?

01:29:51.057 --> 01:29:53.184
Not that good, I'm afraid.

01:29:53.351 --> 01:29:57.272
- I told you leave it. -I know everyone said that.

01:29:58.857 --> 01:30:01.526
I don't think it was the embryos.

01:30:01.693 --> 01:30:06.156
I have managed to create healthy, implantable embryos.

01:30:06.322 --> 01:30:09.117
- Quite an achievement. -Good for you.

01:30:09.284 --> 01:30:10.869
Excuse me.

01:30:11.036 --> 01:30:14.330
What I wanted to say was that we were so close.

01:30:16.958 --> 01:30:19.294
I have to find another way.

01:30:19.544 --> 01:30:21.546
You cannot repeat it.

01:30:21.713 --> 01:30:23.798
- One is left. -An embryo?

01:30:25.508 --> 01:30:28.636
Please stop it. You can't do that to her.

01:30:28.887 --> 01:30:32.432
She would not go through another pregnancy.

01:30:32.599 --> 01:30:35.310
It only works with a surrogate mother.

01:30:35.477 --> 01:30:37.771
You really never give up.

01:30:37.937 --> 01:30:40.815
Do you realize how much I suffer from it?

01:30:40.982 --> 01:30:44.694
I look at the boys every day and think of Isabelle and Zoe.

01:30:44.944 --> 01:30:46.654
I'm not saying anything anymore

01:30:46.905 --> 01:30:49.324
I let myself dance around on my nose.

01:30:49.574 --> 01:30:53.244
Because I constantly imagine that something happens to them.

01:30:53.411 --> 01:30:56.122
You can't raise children like that.

01:31:03.963 --> 01:31:07.550
Would the surrogate mother know what she's carrying?

01:31:07.717 --> 01:31:08.968
Of course not.

01:31:09.219 --> 01:31:11.680
You would just pay a woman

01:31:11.846 --> 01:31:15.016
who has no idea what she's involved in.

01:31:15.725 --> 01:31:20.063
You don't do all this out of kindness, I know you.

01:31:27.445 --> 01:31:29.823
If I don’t tell Isabelle about it,

01:31:30.407 --> 01:31:32.826
she has no hopes either.

01:31:33.076 --> 01:31:36.496
Are you sure you are making the right decision?

01:31:36.746 --> 01:31:37.914
No.

01:31:38.164 --> 01:31:42.127
Hire any surrogate mother to carry Zoe.

01:31:56.016 --> 01:31:58.560
- Yes please?

01:32:04.858 --> 01:32:06.860
Are you going home?

01:32:08.069 --> 01:32:10.530
Yes ... home.

01:32:12.574 --> 01:32:15.118
Please keep me informed.

01:32:16.494 --> 01:32:18.329
Yes I do.

01:32:18.997 --> 01:32:21.166
- Goodbye. - see you again

01:32:32.469 --> 01:32:35.305
It is important to me to know where you are.

01:34:22.746 --> 01:34:25.206
- Do you speak Russian? -A little.

01:34:30.086 --> 01:34:33.298
- How is London? -London just.

01:34:34.549 --> 01:34:36.593
Nice to be at home.

01:34:38.428 --> 01:34:42.015
And you, don't you want to go back to Paris?

01:34:45.643 --> 01:34:47.437
As you know, this is not possible.

01:34:47.604 --> 01:34:51.900
We are now at home here, we ... we feel comfortable.

01:34:56.279 --> 01:34:58.490
And how old is your son now?

01:34:58.656 --> 01:35:00.408
He just turned 5.

01:35:05.288 --> 01:35:07.290
It's nice to see you.

01:35:08.291 --> 01:35:09.834
Yes it's the same for me.

01:36:12.564 --> 01:36:13.606
Ah.

01:36:22.782 --> 01:36:24.284
Who is it

01:36:24.451 --> 01:36:26.536
A friend from England. London.

01:36:26.703 --> 01:36:27.954
Hi.

01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:31.082
- Hi. -What is your name?

01:36:32.083 --> 01:36:34.252
James. And what is your name?

01:36:34.502 --> 01:36:36.212
Zoe.

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.174
Hello, Zoe.

01:36:44.763 --> 01:36:46.765
Are we shy?

01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:49.976
Are you visiting here?

01:36:50.226 --> 01:36:52.228
Yes, a few days.
