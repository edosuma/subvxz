01:06.232 --> 01:08.901
I'm so happy our parents
said we could have
a sleepover, Sofia.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.335
Me too!

01:10.337 --> 01:11.570
A sleepover?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.772
A sleepover with
my bestest bunny friend!

01:13.774 --> 01:16.208
Oh, we're going
to have so much fun!

01:16.210 --> 01:18.343
I can make a campfire...

01:18.345 --> 01:20.779
Crackle, I may be
light and fluffy,

01:20.781 --> 01:22.881
but I am not
a marshmallow.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.416
Sorry. Sorry.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.618
We can play music,
make Freezenberg braids,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.755
and have squishberries
as a midnight snack.
They're my favorites.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.689
I can't wait.

01:30.691 --> 01:31.723
Then we don't have to.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.425
Let's have some now.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.960
They're especially good
warmed-up.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.730
Crackle!

01:38.732 --> 01:40.766
Oh, I'm on.
Check this out!

01:44.237 --> 01:45.471
( giggling ) Perfect.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.639
( laughs )
Thank you.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.441
Mmm!

01:49.443 --> 01:50.809
( munching )

01:50.811 --> 01:52.277
Yummy!

01:52.279 --> 01:54.413
Squishberries are
Crackle's favorite, too.

01:54.415 --> 01:57.382
Ahem! Uh,
food is my favorite.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.383
Here you go, Clover.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.818
( cooing sound )

01:59.820 --> 02:01.653
What was that?
Did you
hear something?

02:01.655 --> 02:04.890
( cooing )

02:04.892 --> 02:08.961
( cooing and babbling )

02:08.963 --> 02:12.931
( gasps )
That is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

02:12.933 --> 02:16.468
Clover, Crackle,
come see this little guy.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.903
Aw!
Aw!

02:17.905 --> 02:19.671
Cuchi-cuchi-cuchi-coo!

02:19.673 --> 02:20.772
Ah!

02:20.774 --> 02:21.773
( giggling )

02:21.775 --> 02:22.908
( sighs sadly )

02:22.910 --> 02:24.676
Oh, poor little thing.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.280
It looks like
he's all alone.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.481
What should we do?

02:29.483 --> 02:30.916
I don't know,

02:30.918 --> 02:32.784
but I don't think we
can just leave him here.

02:32.786 --> 02:33.952
Ahh!

02:33.954 --> 02:35.821
Aw, look at that.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.756
I think he wants
to come home with us.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.258
( happy cooing )

02:39.260 --> 02:41.660
Maybe, my parents
will let me keep him.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.264
( gasps ) I've always wanted
a baby dragon I didn't have
to take care of.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.766
Oh! Hmm.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.968
Do you like
the shiny necklace?

02:49.970 --> 02:51.870
( cooing )

02:57.377 --> 02:59.478
Come on.
Let's get him home.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.880
Okay.

03:01.882 --> 03:05.384
Crackle, you're a little bit
too big for this basket.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.452
Oh, what
a cute little guy.

03:07.454 --> 03:08.787
VIVIAN:
He's adorable!

03:08.789 --> 03:10.656
SOFIA:
Look, he smiled!

03:10.658 --> 03:12.891

( baby dragon cooing )

03:16.496 --> 03:17.796
( bell chimes )

03:17.798 --> 03:19.364
VIVIAN: Mom, Dad,
we're home!

03:19.366 --> 03:20.699
Hello, girls.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.301
How was the
berry-picking?

03:22.303 --> 03:25.037
We got
tons of berries.
Great.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.905
I'll take those
to the kitchen.

03:26.907 --> 03:30.042
Chef Pietro can
make berry pie
for dessert tonight.

03:30.044 --> 03:33.245
Mom, we also got
a little something extra.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.880
A baby dragon.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.315
( coos )

03:36.317 --> 03:38.550
Isn't he just
the cutest thing ever?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.985
Where did
you find it?

03:39.987 --> 03:42.354
In the woods.
He was all alone.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.022
Can I keep him?
Please?

03:44.024 --> 03:47.426
Oh, I don't know, Vivian.
A baby dragon?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.428
They're so...messy.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.263
Please, please,
please, Dad.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.265
( cooing )

03:53.267 --> 03:55.067
He's too tiny
to make a mess.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.703
Oh, all right.
You can keep him.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.937
Oh, thank you, Daddy!

03:58.939 --> 04:01.006
He certainly is cute.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.975
Yes, he is.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.679
All right already.
We get it. He's cute.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.114
KING MARCUS:
( laughing )

04:09.116 --> 04:11.783
We'll take the berries
to the kitchen.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.386
( cooing )

04:14.388 --> 04:15.454
What are you
going to name him?

04:15.456 --> 04:17.122
Hmm...

04:17.124 --> 04:22.461
I need a name as sweet and cute
and lovable as he is.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.962

06:30.257 --> 06:33.558
Oh, look, Crispy's tired.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.194
Aw. I bet
he needs a nap.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.763
Let's get you a blankie.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.898
( gasps )
What blankie?!

06:46.672 --> 06:49.207
My blankie? No!

06:49.209 --> 06:50.909
Uh, Crackle, Crackle...

06:50.911 --> 06:53.178
use your inside fire.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.514
Oh, I can play you
a lullaby.

06:55.516 --> 06:59.050
( strumming softly )

06:59.052 --> 07:00.919
That's beautiful, Vivian.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.621
Thank you.
I just got it.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.624
It's a one-of-a-kind mandolin
made just for me.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.794
And this lullaby is
just for you, Crispy.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.529
Oh, puh-lease.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.265
( strumming )

07:13.267 --> 07:14.733
It's wasted on him.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.301
Babies can't
appreciate good music.

07:17.303 --> 07:20.272
( yawning )

07:24.210 --> 07:25.644
I think it's working.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.978
Aww!

07:26.980 --> 07:28.146
Aww!

07:28.148 --> 07:29.581
Come on.
Let's let him sleep.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.817
Okay, we'll check
on him after dinner.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.319
Ow!
VIVIAN:
Oops, sorry, Crackle.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.654
I didn't see you there.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.822
Come on. Let's go.

07:38.257 --> 07:39.391
No.

07:41.761 --> 07:42.994
Ugh!

07:45.665 --> 07:48.233
Did you see that, Clover?
She didn't even notice me.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.801
What are
you talkin' about?

07:49.803 --> 07:52.137
Vivian. Now that she's
got a new dragon,

07:52.139 --> 07:53.905
it's like she's
forgotten all about me.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.107
Oh, come on.
You're just jealous.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.809
That's not true!
Aah!

07:57.811 --> 07:59.511
Oh, maybe it's
a little true.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.179
But she gave him my blankie.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.315
( gasps ) Crackle!

08:03.317 --> 08:05.016
You took a blankie

08:05.018 --> 08:08.453
from a tiny,
helpless little baby?

08:08.455 --> 08:10.822
You are a grown dragon!

08:10.824 --> 08:13.458
But it's my blankie!

08:13.460 --> 08:15.360
Come on.
Give the little guy a break.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.829
He's probably cold,
shivering,

08:17.831 --> 08:21.800
wishing he had
something soft
and warm to cling to.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.337
Oh, all right. All right.

08:25.339 --> 08:29.007
( sinister
deep-voiced laughter )

08:29.009 --> 08:30.542
Finally!

08:30.544 --> 08:32.878
I thought that kid would
never leave me alone.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.780
Now, I can
get this caper started.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.616
What?!
Hold it right there!

08:37.618 --> 08:39.317
Um... Goo-goo...

08:39.319 --> 08:41.353
You're no baby.
You can talk.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.354
Admit it.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.890
Uh...goo-goo ga-ga?

08:44.892 --> 08:47.993
Don't you
goo-goo ga-ga me!
You're a phony!

08:47.995 --> 08:49.528
All right.
You found me out.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.463
I am really
a grown-up dragon

08:51.465 --> 08:53.031
who just happens to have

08:53.033 --> 08:55.634
( baby voice )
an adorable baby face!

08:55.636 --> 08:57.402
( adult voice ) So now you know
my little secret.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.204
What say I
cut you in on the job?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.472
Job? What are you
talking about?

09:00.474 --> 09:02.407
I got a heist
to pull off, see?

09:02.409 --> 09:05.176
There's a jewel room
in this castle, and
I'm going to rob it.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.546
I'll, uh, split the take
with you if you keep quiet.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.114
What do you say, pal?

09:10.583 --> 09:14.152
I say, no way,
you phony baby crook!

09:14.154 --> 09:15.854
Yeah, yeah,
have it your way then.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.857
But if you're not with me,
then I'm against you.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.426
I'm not gonna let some silly
pet dragon get in my way!

09:21.428 --> 09:23.061
I'm gonna use
this adorable face

09:23.063 --> 09:25.697
to make myself
Vivian's number one, see?

09:25.699 --> 09:28.333
Yeah. I'll be in.
You'll be out.

09:28.335 --> 09:32.270
( sinister laughter )

09:33.506 --> 09:34.806
Hmm!

09:37.209 --> 09:39.210
Clover!

09:39.212 --> 09:41.413
Listen.
Crispy is not a baby.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.915
He's a mean, sneaky,
grown-up dragon crook!

09:43.917 --> 09:46.685
Little Crispy-Wispy?
Ah, not possible.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.687
Totally possible.

09:48.689 --> 09:52.090
He's just pretending
to be a baby so he can
steal our castle jewels.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.225
Now, that's just ridiculous!

09:54.227 --> 09:56.194
I think you're getting
a little carried away
with the jealousy.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.030
It's true. And,
he told me he was going to--

09:59.032 --> 10:01.099
( gulp )
get rid of me.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.536
Crackle, how's he gonna--
( gulp ) get rid of you?

10:04.538 --> 10:07.138
He's just a tiny baby
with tiny paws.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.841
CHEF PIETRO:
( gasps )
My pies! My pies!

10:11.377 --> 10:14.312
Someone ate all
the squishberry pies!

10:14.314 --> 10:15.714
What?!

10:15.716 --> 10:19.384
They're gone. All gone.
Just crumbs...

10:19.386 --> 10:21.286
and scorch marks.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.821
Scorch marks?

10:22.823 --> 10:25.290
Oh, Crackle,
how could you?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.758
Me?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.994
I'm so sorry,
Chef Pietro.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.329
She's never done
anything like this before.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.831
It's really not like her.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.933
Yeah.
Because I didn't do it.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.435
( gasps )
It must've been Crispy.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.803
He's trying to make it
look like I did it.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.739
( gasps ) He's trying
to frame me.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.342
Ohh! I guess
I'll make cookies.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.679
Crackle, there will be
no squishberries for you
for the rest of the week.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.814
( whimpering )

10:49.816 --> 10:52.183
I'm sorry, but
you should know better.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.185
Let's get back
to dinner.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.854
Sofia, wait!

10:55.856 --> 10:58.356
It wasn't me
who ate the pies.
Honest.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.291
It was Crispy.
I know it.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.762
Crispy? But he's
just a baby, Crackle.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.196
He can't even fly.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.765
How would he
even get up there?

11:06.767 --> 11:10.101
Yeah. She's having
kind of a jealousy issue.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.770
Ohh!

11:11.772 --> 11:13.371
No, I'm not!

11:13.373 --> 11:16.374
I'm having kind of
a Crispy-is-a-huge-
phony issue.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.676
And he's a crook.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.644
Sure! ( chuckles )
Told you.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.379
I'm going to
catch up with Vivian.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.882
But, we can talk
about it later, okay?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.984
I'm telling you.
It was Crispy.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.720
He's trying to
get rid of me by turning
Vivian against me.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.823
You're my
best friend, Clover.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.224
You believe me,
don't you?

11:33.226 --> 11:35.126
Ehh...

11:35.128 --> 11:36.828
( gasps ) Look!

11:36.830 --> 11:38.196
Follow that trail

11:38.198 --> 11:40.331
and I promise you
it will lead to...

11:40.333 --> 11:42.000
Pies?
Crispy.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.835
Crispy pies?

11:43.837 --> 11:44.903
( sighs )

11:51.477 --> 11:53.244
CRISPY: Ahh! Ha ha!

11:53.246 --> 11:55.246
( slurping )

11:55.248 --> 11:58.216
( burps ) Ahh!

11:58.218 --> 12:00.819
Huh?
See, Clover.
I told you.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.988
Okay, so? He likes pie.
I give you that.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.091
But it doesn't make him
a hardened criminal

12:06.093 --> 12:07.926
who's out to get you.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.030
Ah ha ha ha ha!

12:12.032 --> 12:14.399
And look,
he can fly, too!

12:14.401 --> 12:16.768
Come on.
We're following him.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.737
CRISPY: ( laughing )

12:18.739 --> 12:19.871
Here it is.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.106
The jewel room, see?

12:21.108 --> 12:23.942
Piles of gold, silver,
gems...

12:23.944 --> 12:25.443
right behind this door.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.079
Come to Papa.
I mean...baby.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.748
( laughing )

12:29.750 --> 12:32.183
Yo! He is a grown-up!
Yeah.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.952
You? I thought for sure

12:33.954 --> 12:35.854
you'd be kicked out
of the house by now.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.088
Well, I'm not!

12:37.090 --> 12:38.456
Now do you believe he's
trying to get rid of me

12:38.458 --> 12:40.291
and steal
the castle jewels?

12:40.293 --> 12:43.962
I do. Listen, you,
no one messes
with my dragon,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.897
or my pies!

12:45.899 --> 12:47.932
We're going to run
you outta this joint
you big phony!

12:47.934 --> 12:49.267
Yeah!

12:49.269 --> 12:50.902
I don't think so,
sweethearts,

12:50.904 --> 12:53.404
'cause to do that,
you'd have to catch me!

12:53.406 --> 12:56.541
( laughing )

12:59.245 --> 13:01.946
Oh, no!
Get that crook!

13:01.948 --> 13:03.081
CRISPY: ( laughing )

13:03.083 --> 13:04.582
Eat my dust, see?

13:04.584 --> 13:06.284
I'm makin' a clean getaway!

13:08.254 --> 13:10.488
What's the matter, kid?
Too slow?

13:12.491 --> 13:13.491
( gasps )

13:13.493 --> 13:15.059
Was that...
Crackle?

13:15.061 --> 13:15.927
And Clover?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.295
SOFIA:
Clover, stop!

13:23.102 --> 13:25.470
Got you now,
you flying phony!

13:25.472 --> 13:27.238
No, I got you.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.474
And I can't wait to see
how you explain this.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.909
Yeah!

13:33.846 --> 13:34.913
( strings twang )

13:34.915 --> 13:36.981
( gasps ) No!

13:36.983 --> 13:39.184
Ah ha ha ha ha!

13:39.186 --> 13:40.318
( growls )

13:40.320 --> 13:42.153
VIVIAN:
My new mandolin?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.355
Crackle, why would
you do that?

13:44.357 --> 13:46.357
I don't even know
what to say.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.960
I never thought
you could do
something like this.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.162
It was Crispy.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.498
Sofe, it <i> was </i> Crispy.
She's telling the truth.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.066
What?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.435
( cooing )

13:57.437 --> 14:00.138
Oh, no. Crispy.
Did Crackle hurt you?

14:00.140 --> 14:01.039
( gasps )

14:01.041 --> 14:02.507
Crackle, I--

14:02.509 --> 14:04.976
I just don't know
what's gotten into you.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.277
I'm sorry, but you
are staying outside

14:06.279 --> 14:07.879
in your dragon house
tonight.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.414
( sighs )

14:12.384 --> 14:14.919
Out, Crackle. Now.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.295
Poor Crispy.
Come on, boy.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.930
Let's go find you a treat.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.201
( huffs )

14:30.203 --> 14:32.003
I'll be right back, Sofia.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.471
Sofe,
Crackle's right.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.506
I saw Crispy
eating the pies.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.976
And then we caught him
trying to sneak into
the jewel room.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.078
He's a phony.
A huge, tiny phony.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.046
You've gotta
tell Vivian.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.082
Okay. I'll be back.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.087
Crackle,
what are you doing?

14:49.089 --> 14:52.390
Leaving.
I know when I'm not wanted.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.092
You don't have to leave.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.060
I told Sofia
all about Crispy.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.930
She's gonna
fix everything,
I promise.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.865
No. Vivian
won't believe her.

15:00.867 --> 15:04.068
She's got her
new baby dragon now.
( sniffs )

15:04.070 --> 15:06.871
Crackle. Crackle.
Wait! Come back!

15:06.873 --> 15:09.007
Crackle! Crackle!

15:09.009 --> 15:11.109
Crackle.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.444
Sofia, stop!

15:13.446 --> 15:17.015
Crackle...
Crackle... ( panting )

15:17.017 --> 15:18.383
Crackle what?

15:18.385 --> 15:19.951
She ran away.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.953
Oh, no.
Vivian!

15:21.955 --> 15:25.256
Vivian! I need
to talk to you. Now.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.357
What's wrong?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.192
SOFIA:
Crackle's run away.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.928
VIVIAN: Wait. What?
Ha ha!

15:29.930 --> 15:33.131
Oh, no...
Maybe I was
too hard on her.

15:33.133 --> 15:36.134
Was I too hard on her?
I never meant
for her to leave.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.535
I gotta go find her.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.904
( cooing )

15:39.906 --> 15:42.540
Uh, Sofia,
will you keep an eye
on Crispy for me?

15:42.542 --> 15:44.208
SOFIA:
Uh, about Crispy...

15:44.210 --> 15:47.345
Tell me later.
I've got to go find Crackle.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.582
Oh! All right, Crispy.
The jig is up.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.151
I know the truth.
What?

15:53.153 --> 15:55.253
Where'd he go?

15:55.255 --> 15:56.554
( gasps ) The jewel room.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.057
Right. Hurry!

15:59.059 --> 16:01.526
Ah ha ha ha ha!

16:07.566 --> 16:09.167
I think we found him.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.403
( coins clattering )

16:12.405 --> 16:14.172
( gasps ) Crispy!

16:14.174 --> 16:15.974
What? You!

16:15.976 --> 16:17.442
So, you brought
your little human.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.277
Think you can
get the drop on me, eh?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.245
Huh! Fat chance.

16:21.247 --> 16:24.148
I wouldn't be so sure
about that, Crispy.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.951
What? Double take!
A human who can
understand animals?

16:26.953 --> 16:31.189
So that's your play.
Well, it's still not
gonna stop me, see?

16:31.191 --> 16:33.458
Aah! You are really
not a baby.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.994
And there's nothing
adorable about you.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.929
Yeah,
you got that right.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.330
Aah!

16:39.332 --> 16:40.365
( straining )

16:40.367 --> 16:41.199
Oh!

16:44.036 --> 16:45.203
Oh, no!

16:45.205 --> 16:47.105
Oh, yeah, doll-face.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.007
It's bye-bye,
baby, see?

16:49.009 --> 16:50.008
Ah ha ha ha ha!

16:50.010 --> 16:51.209
Aah! Sofia!

16:51.211 --> 16:52.543
Clover, go after him!

16:52.545 --> 16:54.345
I can't leave you here!

16:54.347 --> 16:55.880
I'm gonna get you out!

16:55.882 --> 16:57.348
( grunting )

16:59.151 --> 17:02.020
SOFIA:
Clover? Clover.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.325
( panting )

17:07.327 --> 17:10.328
Crackle. Crackle!
Stop!

17:10.330 --> 17:11.295
( gasps ) Vivian?

17:11.297 --> 17:13.297
Vivian!

17:13.299 --> 17:16.367
Oh, Crackle.
I'm so glad I found you.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.470
I don't know what
I would do if I hadn't.

17:19.472 --> 17:23.174
Listen, I know I got angry,
but I never, ever,

17:23.176 --> 17:24.909
ever wanted you to leave.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.244
( sighs )

17:26.246 --> 17:29.247
So...let's go home, okay?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.049
( panting happily )

17:31.051 --> 17:33.284
I know you and Crispy will
find a way to get along.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.357
( grunting )

17:39.359 --> 17:42.193
It's no use. Maybe
you should go get help.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.562
How? No one
understands me but you.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.433
I know. Can you use
your amulet to summon
a princess to help?

17:48.435 --> 17:51.102
( gasps ) My amulet.
That's it.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.371
It can make me
small enough to fit
through the keyhole.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.074
CLOVER:
Ah! I knew
I'd think of something.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.109
I wish to be small.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.477
Whoa!

18:03.115 --> 18:04.482
Oh...

18:04.484 --> 18:06.684
I wish to be really small.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.320
Ah, perfect.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.457
Yes!

18:15.561 --> 18:17.128
( groans )

18:17.130 --> 18:19.297
Now, <i> you </i> are tiny
and adorable.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.032
I wish to be big.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.101
Aah!

18:23.103 --> 18:24.469
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

18:26.538 --> 18:29.440
( straining )

18:29.442 --> 18:31.109
Aah!
( thud )

18:35.547 --> 18:38.282
Crispy!
Drop those jewels.
( thud )

18:38.284 --> 18:39.951
How'd you bust
out of the hoosegow?

18:39.953 --> 18:43.554
Doesn't matter. You can't
stop me now, see?

18:43.556 --> 18:45.623
Yes, we can, Crispy.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.958
CLOVER: Aah!

18:46.960 --> 18:48.126
Yah!

18:48.128 --> 18:49.994
Yeah! Take that.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.497
No! Take this!

18:54.600 --> 18:55.500
CLOVER: Aah!

18:57.102 --> 18:59.670
CRISPY: ( laughing )

18:59.672 --> 19:02.240
( straining )

19:02.242 --> 19:04.442
You're not gonna
get away with this!

19:04.444 --> 19:06.077
What's that, doll?

19:06.079 --> 19:07.278
I couldn't hear you
through my victory laugh.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.446
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

19:08.448 --> 19:10.715
( both grunting )

19:13.085 --> 19:14.252
( gasps )

19:14.254 --> 19:16.587
Crispy?
You're flying?

19:16.589 --> 19:18.523
What are you doing?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.324
CRACKLE:
Get back here, you crook!

19:20.326 --> 19:21.659
Vivian, stop him!

19:21.661 --> 19:23.661
What's going on?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.497
Crispy's a thief.
He's stealing
your castle jewels.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.498
What?!

19:27.500 --> 19:29.367
Back off, pally!

19:29.369 --> 19:31.602
I got a smoking-hot snout,
and I'm not afraid
to use it, see?

19:31.604 --> 19:33.171
Ow!

19:34.106 --> 19:36.174
Oh, my goodness.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.508
Go, Crackle!

19:37.510 --> 19:40.044
All right, flatfoot,
you asked for it!

19:41.680 --> 19:42.680
( grunting )

19:42.682 --> 19:43.681
Aah!

19:43.683 --> 19:45.983
My salad! My lettuce!
My simoleons!

19:45.985 --> 19:47.218
My dough! My moola!
My bacon!

19:47.220 --> 19:48.686
My bread! My cabbage!

19:48.688 --> 19:50.488
Hey, what is this?
What's going on?

19:50.490 --> 19:54.058
I'm getting rid
of you for good!

19:54.060 --> 19:56.627
( grunting )
Let me outta here, see?

19:56.629 --> 19:58.529
If you know
what's good for you!

19:58.531 --> 20:00.631
Let me outta here!
There.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.633
I'm gonna sue you
for wrongful imprisonment!

20:02.635 --> 20:04.669
Crackle, that was amazing!

20:04.671 --> 20:06.704
Cute little Crispy
is a thief?

20:06.706 --> 20:09.207
He is. He just wanted
to get into the castle

20:09.209 --> 20:10.708
so he could steal
your jewels.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.310
I can't believe it.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.045
And he's not even a baby.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.746
He's a grown-up.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.583
He's a complete faker
and a crook.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.251
Oh, Crackle,

20:20.253 --> 20:22.687
I blamed you
for everything today,

20:22.689 --> 20:25.489
and you didn't do
any of it, did you?

20:25.491 --> 20:27.258
Crispy took the pies?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.328
And crushed my mandolin?

20:31.496 --> 20:32.997
Oh, I...

20:32.999 --> 20:35.499
I never should have
doubted you, Crackle.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.501
I'm so sorry.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.669
Can you forgive me?

20:43.842 --> 20:46.677
Royal families
everywhere will be
sleeping well tonight,

20:46.679 --> 20:48.446
thanks to you.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.115
CRACKLE: Whoa!

20:51.117 --> 20:52.683
Huh! It's Crispy.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.286
He's wanted
all the way from
here to Corinthia.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.754
Ah, phooey!

20:56.756 --> 20:59.390
Yes, and we've got
a cozy little fireproof cell

20:59.392 --> 21:00.625
waiting just for you.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.093
( knock knock )

21:02.095 --> 21:03.294
( horses neighing )

21:03.296 --> 21:05.763
( crying )

21:05.765 --> 21:09.267
I want my binky, see?
I want my binky!

21:09.269 --> 21:11.736
( crying )

21:11.738 --> 21:13.904
Girls, thank you

21:13.906 --> 21:15.740
for saving
our royal treasure.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.209
It wasn't us, Dad.
It was Crackle.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.710
She's the one
who stopped Crispy.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.414
Aw...she's such
a good dragon.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.082
She's the best dragon.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.118
Whoo-hoo!

21:28.053 --> 21:29.720
( all gasping )

21:29.722 --> 21:32.189
Sorry!
