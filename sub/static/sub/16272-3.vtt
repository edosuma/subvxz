some kind of ruckus?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.540
Hootenanny? A brouhaha?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.208
You let me know next time
there's a fight,

08:30.210 --> 08:32.277
I want to see it.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.511
Swimming.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.779
A lot of people

08:34.780 --> 08:36.681
don't take swimming seriously.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.518
Well, those people
are dead now.

08:41.455 --> 08:44.656
The hot sauce is located
in the far northeast corner.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.526
Your job is to stay here,
keep watch...

08:47.528 --> 08:49.394
And reset the router
if the wi-fi goes down.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.062
Got it.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.532
Just so you know, jakton,
I might not make it back.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.867
Hell, we all might die today.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.237
Really?
But in this battle, they can
never actually win.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.140
Because you can't
defeat an idea.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.177
Just an old man
passing through...

09:06.179 --> 09:09.080
Don't mind me, just...
Passing through,

09:09.082 --> 09:12.684
making my way to the breakroom
to get some hard candy.

09:12.686 --> 09:16.254
Just an old man,
standing right here behind you.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.390
Nothing to look at.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.658
Ah-ha!

09:19.660 --> 09:22.193
The hot sauce is ours!

09:22.195 --> 09:23.662
Hiya!

09:25.766 --> 09:28.567
(coughing)

09:28.569 --> 09:30.168
(door closes)

09:30.170 --> 09:31.903
did everyone see that?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.171
I mean, I'm not... I'm not gay.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.873
But that guy was naked.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.075
(laughing):
And they cheered for their hero,

09:37.077 --> 09:40.445
for they knew their burritos
would be bland no longer.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.013
Why'd you have to be naked?

09:42.015 --> 09:43.949
Trust me,
there was no other way.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.851
<i>Speaking</i> of a war that'll
never end until one man dies,

09:46.853 --> 09:49.120
your mom tells me
you're being teased.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.789
Are you serious?
Because a good friend of mine

09:50.791 --> 09:52.057
wrote "swamp butt"
on my backpack?

09:52.059 --> 09:53.692
No, that's a cool thing.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.027
That's, like, a compliment.
That's a swampliment.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.529
Hey, look. The only way
to deal with a bully

09:57.531 --> 09:58.930
is to stand up to him.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.632
Like I did, for years,
with vulchazor.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.534
And more recently at work,
with the hot sauce fella.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.169
Dad, there's nothing
going on here, at all.

10:06.940 --> 10:07.939
(sighs)

10:07.941 --> 10:09.541
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

10:09.543 --> 10:12.077
So I suppose "nothing"
gave you that black eye?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.712
(crickets chirping, dog barking)

10:13.714 --> 10:15.080
can't I just...
Stay away from warren

10:15.082 --> 10:16.481
until I graduate?
Or I could, you know,

10:16.483 --> 10:18.483
drop out and move to a cabin
and do, like...

10:18.485 --> 10:20.151
I don't know, online sales.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.120
Hey, alangulon.
I know you think you're weak.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.989
But real talk, here: Sometimes,
your greatest weakness

10:23.991 --> 10:26.491
can turn out to be
your greatest strength.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.994
Now, prepare to die!
Edie: Zorn, no!

10:28.996 --> 10:30.595
Stop the fighting, or I'll kick

10:30.597 --> 10:32.831
both your asses.
Give me that.
Craig: Guys,

10:32.833 --> 10:34.399
please watch it
with your swords.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.434
The wood here is made
from reclaimed boats.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.937
Ah, come on. I'm showing the kid
how to take someone's life.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.572
I'm not showing him pornography.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.807
Alan is in high school.
Not a warzone.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.142
(gasps)

10:44.144 --> 10:46.778
did someone hit you?
I'm fine, mom, okay?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.179
Edie:
Oh, my god,
did this happen at school?

10:48.181 --> 10:50.815
Alan, you have
to tell me everything.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.084
Yeah, it's a kid
in my gym class,

10:53.086 --> 10:55.020
and we were by
the swimming pool,

10:55.022 --> 10:56.521
and just, like
things happened, whatever.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.789
There's nothing I can
do about it, okay?

10:57.791 --> 10:59.024
It is what it is.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.592
Look I don't want to butt in,

11:00.594 --> 11:03.428
but sometimes the best defense
is <i> defense.</i>

11:03.430 --> 11:04.963
I myself developed

11:04.965 --> 11:06.931
a pretty useful maneuver
back in the day.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.768
(groans)
okay, it's technically
not karate,

11:09.770 --> 11:11.302
but it's cool.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.872
Now, imagine that a bully
just pushed you in the mud,

11:13.874 --> 11:15.974
and she's coming back
to kick you.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.942
All you have to do
is get down

11:17.944 --> 11:20.545
on the floor
and do a little maneuver

11:20.547 --> 11:24.382
that I like to call
"the frightened turtle."

11:24.384 --> 11:25.784
craig, that's the dumbest
thing I've ever seen.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.118
See, I can't hear you, zorn,

11:27.120 --> 11:28.353
'cause I'm in my
turtle shell.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.688
Of course you can
hear me.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.156
No, I didn't
hear that either.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.024
No, you're lying because
there's no actual shell,

11:33.026 --> 11:34.559
so I know you can't
<i>not</i> hear me.

11:34.561 --> 11:35.827
You're a liar.
Okay.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.462
I don't condone fighting,

11:37.464 --> 11:39.064
but if you're gonna do it,
let your mommy teach you.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.331
I have a lot
of experience

11:40.333 --> 11:41.800
with bullying.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.835
Mostly on the other end,
but it still applies.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.337
Okay, come at me.
Try to punch me.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.339
What? No. Okay,
this is really weird.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.674
Alangulon, you listen
to your mother.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.209
You punch her in the face!

11:51.211 --> 11:52.410
Alan, I'm not gonna
hurt you, I just want

11:52.412 --> 11:53.545
to show you a move--
come on!

11:53.547 --> 11:55.046
Alan: Craig, you want
to step in here?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.182
I'd actually like to see
where this is going.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.717
Okay, come at me.
Try to punch me.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.852
Just try to punch me.
You can't punch me?

12:00.854 --> 12:03.054
Oh, come on, just
try to punch me, just try.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.156
You can't do it.
Hyah!

12:05.158 --> 12:07.492
(alan cries out)

12:07.494 --> 12:09.094
don't kill him!
Edie, that was so hot!

12:09.096 --> 12:11.062
Oh!

12:11.064 --> 12:12.530
Oh, my god.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.232
I'm so sorry.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.533
(groaning)
my instincts
just took over.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.035
It was muscle memory.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.504
How did your muscles
remember something like that?

12:19.506 --> 12:21.873
I... Your dad
taught me that move.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.775
The five strike
zephyrian death attack.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.344
Well, four strikes of it.
Where was that move
when I was

12:26.346 --> 12:28.346
getting charged extra for cookie
crumbles at mr. Yogurt?

12:28.348 --> 12:29.748
Hmm.
Look, I don't want
to kill anyone

12:29.750 --> 12:31.516
by accident,
all right?

12:31.518 --> 12:33.685
Don't want to kill anyone
on purpose either!

12:33.687 --> 12:35.086
And, craig, I'm not
gonna do that stupid

12:35.088 --> 12:36.087
upside-down
turtle thing.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.056
Okay, I'm not a warrior.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.524
I don't want
to fight anyone.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.558
Just...

12:40.560 --> 12:42.560
Oh, alan, I'm sorry!

12:42.562 --> 12:44.629
I'd hug you right now,
but one more touch from me

12:44.631 --> 12:46.131
and your head
will explode.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.700
Well, we <i> should</i> explode
your head, alangulon!

12:48.702 --> 12:51.970
'cause it's full of
wrong ideas about battling!

12:58.378 --> 13:00.078
What?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.513
(screams)

13:04.718 --> 13:07.652
(horn blares)
(whimpering)

13:11.958 --> 13:14.025
(war drums, vocals)

13:15.629 --> 13:17.562
zoooorn!

13:22.135 --> 13:23.134
Linda:
<i>I don't want to see you</i>

13:23.136 --> 13:24.903
within ten feet
of the breakroom

13:24.905 --> 13:26.171
or any bottle of hot sauce

13:26.173 --> 13:27.605
of any condiment of any kind,

13:27.607 --> 13:29.407
or any person or office.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.642
Yes, sir.
I understand.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.677
This is your
last chance, zorn.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.145
I swear to god
I'll face

13:34.147 --> 13:36.080
another discrimination
suit if I have to.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.517
I beat it before
and I'll beat it again.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.019
(sighs)

13:44.791 --> 13:46.224
(whispering):
Zorn!

13:47.494 --> 13:49.661
Zorn, it's me.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.162
No, jakton, please,

13:51.164 --> 13:52.463
I don't want you to have
to see me like this.

13:52.465 --> 13:53.998
Cast from the bullpen

13:54.000 --> 13:55.466
into this lonely hallway,

13:55.468 --> 13:56.701
all by myself.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.203
Which is, actually,

13:58.205 --> 13:59.470
like my own office.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.105
Huh. That's pretty sweet.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.440
No, no, this is important.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.775
That guy from
the other office--

14:03.777 --> 14:05.176
things have gotten worse.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.212
It's not just
the hot sauce anymore.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.847
He ransacked
the yogurts

14:08.849 --> 14:10.481
and those little tiny
packets of soy sauce!

14:10.483 --> 14:13.184
He even started taking
the cranberry cocktails.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.820
Well, now, hold on,
he took our cranberry cocktails?

14:15.822 --> 14:18.323
Well, the battle resumes.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.859
Also, I'm battling a uti,
so I kind of need those.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.295
(knock on door)

14:24.297 --> 14:27.298
come in.
(door opens)

14:28.802 --> 14:30.869
listen, I'm sorry
about last night.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.371
I guess I sort of had
a flashback to my past.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.039
It was kind of
a rush, though.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.908
Remember, I was, like,
(exhales sharply)

14:36.910 --> 14:38.076
with my arm,
and then you freaked out,

14:38.078 --> 14:39.344
and you were, like, "aah!"

14:39.346 --> 14:40.879
yeah. Mom...

14:40.881 --> 14:43.882
Sorry. Anyway...

14:43.884 --> 14:45.817
I totally get that
you don't want to fight.

14:45.819 --> 14:48.052
What's this?
It's a note
to your gym teacher.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.754
It says you're
allergic to chlorine.

14:49.756 --> 14:52.757
So that should buy you a few
weeks away from this kid.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.629
Yeah, uh, thanks.

14:58.832 --> 14:59.764
No! Death strike!

14:59.766 --> 15:02.233
(gasps) honestly...

15:02.235 --> 15:03.768
I don't know if I'm ever gonna
be able to touch you again.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.270
Want me to
look it up online?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.105
That would be great.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.806
(exhales)

15:13.113 --> 15:15.680
oh! Ugh!

15:15.682 --> 15:18.249
Is that blood?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.084
Dude, I just drank blood!

15:20.086 --> 15:21.920
Where is he? Huh?

15:21.922 --> 15:24.088
Where's the guy
who put the blood

15:24.090 --> 15:25.390
in my cran-pom?

15:25.392 --> 15:27.725
Huh?

15:27.727 --> 15:28.960
Because I'm gonna
fill <i> his</i> mouth with blood.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.128
<i>His</i> blood!

15:30.130 --> 15:32.030
Looking for me?

15:34.701 --> 15:35.934
(grunts)

15:35.936 --> 15:38.569
I am gonna beat
your ass, bitch!

15:38.571 --> 15:40.305
Let's just get
to the point.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.106
What, was that supposed
to be a joke or something?

15:42.108 --> 15:44.876
What's wrong, you don't
appreciate my sharp wit?

15:44.878 --> 15:47.445
Dude, you're not
even funny-- shut up!
Linda: Hey!

15:47.447 --> 15:48.713
Hey! Seriously?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.548
Is...Is this about
the hot sauce?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.717
'cause there's literally three
other bottles in the pantry.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.552
Aw, come on, linda!
Everyone knows you don't

15:54.554 --> 15:56.287
open a new bottle till
the old bottle's finished.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.423
Derek whitford!
Damn!

15:58.425 --> 16:01.092
What in god's name
is the meaning of this?

16:01.094 --> 16:03.561
Stephen, it seems
as though our employees

16:03.563 --> 16:06.297
are having a disagreement over
something completely idiotic.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.298
No, it's not!

16:07.300 --> 16:09.901
I...I'm sorry, derek,

16:09.903 --> 16:11.836
apologize to these people.
What?

16:11.838 --> 16:13.404
No, no, please don't.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.672
Aw, fine!

16:14.674 --> 16:16.407
What are you doing?
No, don't do this.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.575
Don't walk over here,

16:17.577 --> 16:18.810
don't look at me, don't...

16:18.812 --> 16:20.345
Sorry I took
your stupid snacks.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.113
What was that?
Stop. Stop.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.315
I'm begging you, don't do it.
Let's just fight.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.617
I said I'm sorry I took
your stupid snacks!

16:26.619 --> 16:29.120
No... Come on!

16:29.122 --> 16:30.955
Stephan: We're going back
to the office right now.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.290
You haven't tweeted
from the corporate account

16:32.292 --> 16:33.524
in two hours.
(scoffs)

16:33.526 --> 16:35.326
please don't take
the high road.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.694
Let's just fight it out.
I need this fight to happen.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.162
I miss it so much.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.464
Come on back.
Come on, come on, fight me.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.099
We can switch weapons.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.034
I'll use the coat rack,
and you can use my sword.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.874
(bell rings)
(sighs)

16:49.876 --> 16:52.944
I gotta say I'm pretty
skeptical about this.

16:52.946 --> 16:55.113
But the last time
I doubted a kid's note,

16:55.115 --> 16:56.681
turns out he was
being kidnapped.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.851
Anyway, go, uh,
run a few laps,

16:59.853 --> 17:01.886
then, uh, I don't know,

17:01.888 --> 17:04.454
jump over a cone
or something.

(chuckles)

17:15.969 --> 17:18.169
(fake gasp)
oh, my god!

17:18.171 --> 17:20.371
Look at your legs.
You're a total freak.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.507
Okay, you know what, warren?
It's genetic.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.008
All right?
I'm half zephyrian.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.577
Whatever you are, I can't
wait to tell everyone.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.512
Dude, does your sweat
run upwards

17:28.515 --> 17:30.415
to avoid your weird-ass legs?

17:30.417 --> 17:31.749
When you came out
of your mom,

17:31.751 --> 17:33.751
was she, like,
"god, what is that?"

17:33.753 --> 17:36.154
whatever, I can't understand you
'cause I don't speak whale.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.223
What?

17:39.225 --> 17:42.226
I said, I wish I could
understand you,

17:42.228 --> 17:45.730
but I don't speak
whale language.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.165
(grunts)

17:49.502 --> 17:50.701
ah!

17:50.703 --> 17:52.103
(chuckles)

17:52.105 --> 17:54.238
what are you,
my five-year-old brother?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.040
I can't hear you.
I'm in my shell.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.742
I'm in my shell!

17:57.744 --> 18:01.746
(chuckles) dude, just let
this beatdown happen.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.481
(alan grunts)

18:07.287 --> 18:09.787
(warren groaning)
what the hell?

18:14.961 --> 18:17.462
Dude, uh, I don't...
I'm sorry.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.332
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

18:29.476 --> 18:31.375
I've dishonored
myself in battle.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.744
Here, take my sword.
(sword clangs)

18:33.746 --> 18:35.913
just do it fast, and
make it a clean cut.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.282
And please, if you will,
see to it that my head

18:38.284 --> 18:40.251
is wearing a skull bandana
at my funeral.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.620
Do you want me
to decapitate you right now?

18:42.622 --> 18:44.622
Yes, I would like that
very much.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.890
I'm not gonna do that.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.158
Aw, linda, you suck.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.426
It's like you have
this obsession

18:48.428 --> 18:49.560
where you have to turn
every little thing

18:49.562 --> 18:50.795
into a battle.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.597
I know, it's a real problem.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.665
But what you don't realize is...

18:54.667 --> 18:57.902
There's a high-stakes battle
going on all around you.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.271
All right, fine!
I'll hear you out.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.006
But then, seriously,
after that,

19:02.008 --> 19:04.175
you got to cut off my head.
You are a warrior

19:04.177 --> 19:07.145
for the kingdom
of sanitation solutions.

19:07.147 --> 19:10.982
And the theater of war
is mall bathrooms,

19:10.984 --> 19:13.251
restaurant chain bathrooms,

19:13.253 --> 19:15.786
convention center bathrooms.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.954
Airport bathrooms?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.456
I think you're getting it.
Dogs.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.324
No.
Right. Right, right, right.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.793
Strong-arming clients,
scrapping for your bonus,

19:22.795 --> 19:24.629
suppressing reports
that say our foam

19:24.631 --> 19:26.164
might be carcinogenic.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.432
These are the thrills
of combat.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.967
Okay, hold on.
So now, you're saying

19:29.969 --> 19:31.802
if I start doing well at my job,

19:31.804 --> 19:33.838
I'll have the, um,
same satisfaction

19:33.840 --> 19:36.874
as, like, killing off
an entire race of crab people?

19:36.876 --> 19:38.976
Exactly.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.746
That's exactly what I'm saying.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.216
Hey, there he is!
The killer!

19:45.218 --> 19:48.486
The victor! Alangulon
the brutalizer!

19:48.488 --> 19:49.887
I knew you had it in you, son.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.322
Come on, tell
the story, alangulon.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.124
Dad, I've told it, like,
a million times already.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.792
All right, do you want
to hear it again? Probably not.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.360
Yeah, 'cause it's
an amazing story!

19:56.362 --> 19:58.196
I, uh, I kicked a fat kid.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.397
You're welcome.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.665
Well, fortunately for you,

20:00.667 --> 20:01.899
I've taken it upon myself

20:01.901 --> 20:03.534
to ensure that
future generations

20:03.536 --> 20:05.736
will know the story
of alangulon,

20:05.738 --> 20:07.705
kicker of fat kids,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.407
haver of sadistic rage

20:09.409 --> 20:11.209
underneath his
effeminate exterior!

20:11.211 --> 20:12.243
Boy that we're all
very proud of.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.312
Future castrator of craig!

20:14.314 --> 20:18.182
(laughs)
oh, zorn...

20:18.184 --> 20:19.217
