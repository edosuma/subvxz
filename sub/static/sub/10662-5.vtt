WEBVTT

00:00.004 --> 00:03.101
The Carmichael Show is recorded
in front of a live studio audience.

00:03.102 --> 00:04.501
Wow, Nekeisha.

00:04.502 --> 00:05.669
This place looks a lot different

00:05.670 --> 00:06.937
from when Bobby used to live here.

00:06.938 --> 00:10.140
Yes, hot pink and animal print.

00:10.141 --> 00:14.645
Oh, you're making a lot
of bold choices in here.

00:14.646 --> 00:16.347
This looks like the front room

00:16.347 --> 00:18.882
where you pay to get in the strip club.

00:18.883 --> 00:20.684
Joe!

00:20.685 --> 00:23.721
I need to explain something;
I've been to strip clubs.

00:23.722 --> 00:26.924
Man, I am excited about
moving back in here.

00:26.925 --> 00:28.759
You know, giving our
relationship another shot.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.729
But-but this time, it's not
a real relationship at all.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.631
It's just two platonic friends,

00:33.632 --> 00:37.434
uh, sharing the rent and a bathroom

00:37.435 --> 00:39.603
and sexual tension.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.772
There will be no sexual tension, Bobby.

00:41.773 --> 00:44.842
See, there it is.

00:44.843 --> 00:48.112
Okay, Joe, so how many strip
clubs are we talking about?

00:49.514 --> 00:51.215
I can't believe I...

00:51.216 --> 00:52.716
remember something trivial like that.

00:52.717 --> 00:54.118
That's like me asking you

00:54.119 --> 00:56.519
how many Burlington Coat
Factories you been to.

00:58.122 --> 00:59.456
Seven.

00:59.457 --> 01:02.391
I've been to seven Burlington
Coat Factories, Joe.

01:03.694 --> 01:05.728
Thirty-two.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.635
Look at you. You're moving
out of Mom and Dad's,

01:11.636 --> 01:12.936
and that's amazing.

01:12.937 --> 01:14.571
And you're moving back
in with your ex-wife,

01:14.572 --> 01:16.173
and that's...

01:16.174 --> 01:17.607
amazing.

01:18.709 --> 01:19.877
Uh, Nekeisha, is this ottoman

01:19.878 --> 01:21.612
- okay to sit on?
- Uh, that's not a ottoman.

01:21.613 --> 01:23.981
That is just one of my sweaters
thrown over some shoeboxes,

01:23.982 --> 01:25.816
but you can sit on it.

01:25.817 --> 01:27.116
Oh.

01:28.152 --> 01:30.788
I'll just stand.

01:30.789 --> 01:32.790
Thank you so much for having us.

01:33.958 --> 01:35.492
Nekeisha, you expecting somebody?

01:35.493 --> 01:36.794
Nekeisha Williams.

01:36.795 --> 01:38.028
I know you're home.

01:38.029 --> 01:39.630
- Shh. Everybody shut up.
- Open up.

01:39.631 --> 01:41.498
Are we in danger?

01:42.500 --> 01:43.801
Nekeisha, who's at the door?

01:43.802 --> 01:45.936
- No one.
- Who wants to play a game?

01:45.937 --> 01:47.037
Ooh, ooh, I got a game.

01:47.038 --> 01:48.105
It's called, uh,

01:48.106 --> 01:50.374
who the hell is at the door, Nekeisha?

01:51.643 --> 01:52.943
I got a game.

01:52.944 --> 01:54.111
Let's play Follow the Leader.

01:54.112 --> 01:56.046
Out the window, down the fire escape.

01:56.047 --> 01:57.681
Line up fastest to slowest.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.083
Well, how do we know who's fastest?

01:59.084 --> 02:01.384
See you in the car, Joe!

02:02.286 --> 02:03.687
What is going on here, Nekeisha?

02:03.688 --> 02:05.322
Open the door or I'm coming in.

02:05.323 --> 02:07.658
Nekeisha, I need you
to be honest with me.

02:07.659 --> 02:10.092
Do you have cocaine in this apartment?

02:11.595 --> 02:13.734
You cannot come in here.
That is illegal to come

02:13.735 --> 02:15.461
into somebody's apartment
without their permission.

02:15.462 --> 02:18.089
No, it's illegal for you not to
pay your rent for three months.

02:18.090 --> 02:20.637
We've already given you
your final eviction notice.

02:20.638 --> 02:22.172
We've been through this before.

02:22.173 --> 02:24.174
Don't act surprised.

02:24.175 --> 02:26.009
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Evicted?

02:26.010 --> 02:29.179
I just moved all my stuff in here.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.581
Then you can act surprised.

02:32.449 --> 02:35.051
And I told you, no pets.

02:53.362 --> 02:54.874
Can you believe that guy?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.944
Kicking me out of my own home.

02:57.062 --> 02:58.778
Shoot, you? He kicked both of us out.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.847
Look, Nekeisha, of
course he kicked you out.

03:02.848 --> 03:04.749
He said you hadn't paid
your rent in three months.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.417
I mean, what did you expect to happen?

03:06.418 --> 03:08.719
I thought he had to hand me
the eviction notice in person,

03:08.720 --> 03:11.421
so I just kept trying to avoid him.

03:12.289 --> 03:14.191
How did you get so far behind?

03:14.192 --> 03:15.559
They kept doubling my rent.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.195
Ever since that Whole Foods
moved in around the corner,

03:18.196 --> 03:19.358
I don't know what it is,

03:19.359 --> 03:20.931
but there's something
about cold-pressed juice

03:20.932 --> 03:23.033
that make people feel safe.

03:24.403 --> 03:25.970
It's been a rough day.

03:25.971 --> 03:28.406
I'm just gonna unbutton
my pants and lay down.

03:28.407 --> 03:31.008
Excuse me.

03:31.009 --> 03:33.344
You know, there's a term for
what's going on with Nekeisha.

03:33.345 --> 03:34.512
Poverty?

03:34.513 --> 03:37.148
Or a bad attitude?

03:37.149 --> 03:38.616
You know, she's kind of

03:38.617 --> 03:42.520
like if a TSA agent and a
postal worker had a baby.

03:42.521 --> 03:44.155
What? No, no.

03:44.156 --> 03:46.424
You know, it's no coincidence
that a Whole Foods moved in

03:46.425 --> 03:48.292
and Nekeisha is getting pushed out.

03:48.293 --> 03:51.028
It's called gentrification,
and she's a victim.

03:51.029 --> 03:52.363
She's a victim?

03:52.364 --> 03:54.131
She's unbuttoning her
pants in our bed right now.

03:54.132 --> 03:55.733
I think we're the victims.

03:55.734 --> 03:58.769
Gentrification. I've heard
Spike Lee say that word

03:58.770 --> 04:01.539
on CNN every 25 minutes.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.007
Yeah, that's one of those long words

04:03.008 --> 04:04.542
I was told to be afraid of.

04:04.543 --> 04:06.644
Gentrification, hypertension,

04:06.645 --> 04:09.547
refinance...

04:09.548 --> 04:11.782
I know I'm missing a word,
but y'all get the point.

04:11.783 --> 04:12.983
Yeah.

04:12.984 --> 04:15.352
Well, Dad, let me explain
what gentrification is.

04:15.353 --> 04:17.721
You see, gentrification is
a beautiful thing where...

04:17.721 --> 04:19.789
Mesothelioma!

04:23.928 --> 04:25.830
I knew I was missing a word.

04:25.831 --> 04:27.431
Carry on.

04:27.432 --> 04:30.367
Well, gentrification is essentially

04:30.368 --> 04:32.269
when developers look at
a neighborhood the way

04:32.270 --> 04:34.271
Richard Gere looked at Julia
Roberts in Pretty Woman.

04:34.272 --> 04:37.308
You know, you see past
all the flaws of the past.

04:37.309 --> 04:39.677
You see a perfect spot for a Starbucks

04:39.678 --> 04:43.981
or an Ethiopian restaurant
run by non-Ethiopians.

04:43.982 --> 04:47.685
So you're saying gentrification
is like when rich people

04:47.686 --> 04:49.820
say to a neighborhood,
"I can change you."

04:49.821 --> 04:52.823
And the neighborhood is like,
"Good, because I want to leave

04:52.824 --> 04:55.459
this dirty prostitution life behind."

04:55.460 --> 04:57.194
And-and the rich people

04:57.195 --> 04:59.463
are like, "Well, I'm gonna
give you a bunch of money.

04:59.464 --> 05:01.432
"Go clean yourself up
so you don't embarrass me

05:01.433 --> 05:02.733
in front of my classy friends."

05:02.734 --> 05:04.034
Yes, yes.

05:04.035 --> 05:05.436
That's exactly what it is, Ma.

05:05.437 --> 05:07.838
It's when really nice rich people

05:07.839 --> 05:09.874
give a bad neighborhood a new beginning.

05:09.875 --> 05:13.043
What? That is such a glorified
view of gentrification.

05:13.044 --> 05:14.778
Well, what is it, then?

05:14.779 --> 05:18.415
And can you use a movie example?

05:18.416 --> 05:20.351
Well, I don't have a movie example,

05:20.352 --> 05:22.253
but I can just tell you what it means,

05:22.254 --> 05:24.021
- if that works.
- Well, I suppose,

05:24.022 --> 05:26.357
but just know I'm gonna be
thinking of a movie example

05:26.358 --> 05:28.759
the whole time.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.128
Look, gentrification
is when developers see

05:31.129 --> 05:32.763
an opportunity to make money

05:32.764 --> 05:34.365
off of a low-income community.

05:34.366 --> 05:36.367
You know, they buy up a
bunch of property for cheap,

05:36.368 --> 05:38.802
and then they build
high-end apartment complexes

05:38.803 --> 05:40.704
and restaurants and stores,

05:40.705 --> 05:42.706
and that attracts wealthy new residents,

05:42.707 --> 05:45.142
and then that drives property values up

05:45.143 --> 05:46.603
until people are forced out.

05:46.604 --> 05:48.579
Now, I know you're trying
to say something negative,

05:48.580 --> 05:51.515
but everything you saying
so far sounds good to me.

05:51.516 --> 05:52.983
I mean,

05:52.984 --> 05:56.287
you're basically just describing
how to win at Monopoly.

05:56.288 --> 05:57.855
Look here.

05:57.856 --> 06:00.991
Those people you pushing out got
names, like Nekeisha and Bobby.

06:00.992 --> 06:02.293
And those buildings you're talking about

06:02.294 --> 06:03.627
is like this one right here.

06:03.628 --> 06:04.995
Bobby's got a point.

06:04.996 --> 06:07.798
You and Jerrod are living in
this newly-renovated apartment

06:07.799 --> 06:09.366
just minutes from Nekeisha's.

06:09.367 --> 06:12.036
And just the other day,
you all were going on and on

06:12.037 --> 06:13.871
about the fancy ice cream parlor

06:13.872 --> 06:15.973
that just moved into your neighborhood.

06:15.974 --> 06:18.976
It's actually a
Japanese shaved ice shop.

06:18.977 --> 06:21.878
You're not helping your case, Maxine.

06:23.147 --> 06:25.849
It sounds to me like the two
of you are the gentrifiers.

06:25.850 --> 06:27.117
What? No, no.

06:27.118 --> 06:28.786
Jerrod and I are not those people.

06:28.787 --> 06:30.521
Well, of course we are, Maxine.

06:30.522 --> 06:32.089
I mean, think about it.

06:32.090 --> 06:34.758
Our street's shut down every
Sunday for a farmer's market.

06:34.759 --> 06:37.227
You know your spin
class instructor by name.

06:37.228 --> 06:39.292
Sometimes we take jogs
around the neighborhood

06:39.293 --> 06:41.131
just to appreciate all
the murals around here.

06:41.132 --> 06:42.933
You know, a mural on
the side of a warehouse

06:42.934 --> 06:45.102
is the official flag of gentrification.

06:45.103 --> 06:47.404
Yeah, but I have a social conscience.

06:47.405 --> 06:49.306
I mean, I support local business.

06:49.307 --> 06:51.542
I give my leftovers to homeless people,

06:51.543 --> 06:55.279
even if I know I'm
gonna want them later.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.047
Well, a lot of those
people are friends of mine

06:57.048 --> 06:59.883
that's being pushed out for
you and your farmer's markets.

06:59.884 --> 07:03.287
How come everything around
here got avocado in it now?

07:03.288 --> 07:05.889
Bobby, please.

07:05.890 --> 07:08.058
Quit acting like this
neighborhood used to be amazing.

07:08.059 --> 07:09.960
I mean, when you first moved in,

07:09.961 --> 07:11.395
you were afraid to go out at night.

07:11.396 --> 07:14.031
I mean, buildings were falling
apart, drugs were everywhere.

07:14.032 --> 07:15.633
If anything, I'd say people like me

07:15.634 --> 07:17.267
made this neighborhood better.

07:17.268 --> 07:18.268
How?

07:18.269 --> 07:20.170
By kicking people like me out of it?

07:20.171 --> 07:22.139
You sound real arrogant right now, man.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.707
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, you guys, come on.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.377
- I mean, this is complicated.
- No, no, it's simple, Maxine.

07:26.378 --> 07:27.978
Jerrod gentrified me and Nekeisha

07:27.979 --> 07:30.113
out our own neighborhood.

07:31.382 --> 07:33.350
And now I got to move
back in with Mom and Dad.

07:33.351 --> 07:35.019
You're blaming me for this, Bobby?

07:35.020 --> 07:36.687
You were living with
Mom and Dad this morning.

07:36.688 --> 07:38.888
It's really not that big of a move, man.

07:40.357 --> 07:43.993
I can't believe you gentrified
a member of your own family.

07:45.062 --> 07:46.830
You two are brothers!

07:46.831 --> 07:48.132
Now, listen.

07:48.133 --> 07:50.267
I always did get a Cain and Abel vibe

07:50.268 --> 07:52.202
from you two boys.

07:52.203 --> 07:54.471
But I was never sure which one was Cain.

07:54.472 --> 07:56.173
But now it's obvious.

07:56.174 --> 07:57.708
Bobby, watch your back,

07:57.709 --> 08:01.679
because Cain was the skinny
one in the Bible, too.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.048
Ma, you have no idea
what Cain looked like;

08:04.049 --> 08:06.115
he was literally the
third person on Earth.

08:07.017 --> 08:08.851
I can make a guesstimate.

08:10.688 --> 08:11.771
I don't know why

08:11.772 --> 08:13.924
I'm the one that has to
defend themselves here.

08:13.925 --> 08:15.585
Aren't you supposed
to be proud of the son

08:15.586 --> 08:17.790
who has a nice place to
live, who has a good job

08:17.791 --> 08:19.163
and a hot girlfriend to come home to?

08:19.164 --> 08:20.364
I also realize you're smart,

08:20.365 --> 08:23.333
but I'm making a point here, Maxine.

08:23.334 --> 08:26.737
Okay, wait. So I'm the loser
son they should be ashamed of?

08:26.738 --> 08:30.039
Wait a minute, you calling me
the Jeb Bush of this family?

08:30.908 --> 08:33.143
No, Jeb Bush was a governor, Bobby.

08:33.144 --> 08:34.712
You got fired from Arby's.

08:34.712 --> 08:37.414
That was a conspiracy.

08:37.414 --> 08:40.116
I saw a lot of things I
wasn't supposed to see.

08:40.118 --> 08:42.152
Look at you. You're
always making excuses, man.

08:42.153 --> 08:43.520
Excuses?

08:43.520 --> 08:45.923
Oh, you mean like, uh, lack
of jobs, lack of opportunity,

08:45.924 --> 08:47.357
a system that's set up

08:47.358 --> 08:48.358
to keep us down?

08:48.359 --> 08:49.760
Those are real.

08:49.761 --> 08:50.961
You used to know that.

08:50.962 --> 08:52.896
But I guess you forgot
where you came from.

08:52.897 --> 08:54.932
How in the hell could I
forget where I came from

08:54.933 --> 08:57.668
when everybody I grew up with
is in my apartment right now?

08:57.669 --> 08:58.802
Bobby,

08:58.803 --> 09:00.738
people get knocked down all the time,

09:00.739 --> 09:02.840
but they get back up and
they dust themselves off.

09:02.841 --> 09:04.108
But no, not you.

09:04.109 --> 09:05.476
You just lie there on the ground

09:05.477 --> 09:06.944
and complain about how bumpy it is.

09:06.945 --> 09:08.912
Wow.

09:08.913 --> 09:11.148
That's what you really think of me?

09:11.149 --> 09:12.516
You know something, man?

09:12.517 --> 09:14.984
Let me get out of here, man,
go lay on the lumpy ground.

09:16.653 --> 09:19.189
Jerrod, you apologize right now.

09:19.190 --> 09:21.958
Before he actually go out there
and lay down on the ground!

09:23.927 --> 09:27.931
I'm not going to apologize
because I didn't do anything.

09:27.932 --> 09:31.034
It's hard to get any rest
with all this arguing going on.

09:31.035 --> 09:32.202
But I guess it's for the best,

09:32.203 --> 09:33.871
'cause I got to find a
place to stay tonight.

09:33.872 --> 09:34.872
You can stay here.

09:34.873 --> 09:36.673
Maxine, what are you doing?

09:36.674 --> 09:39.877
Well, look, I need to help her, Jerrod.

09:39.878 --> 09:42.980
Last week, I had shaved
ice with my spin instructor.

09:42.981 --> 09:44.780
I'm in too deep.

09:46.517 --> 09:48.986
Nekeisha, you are welcome to
stay here as long as you need,

09:48.987 --> 09:50.154
until you figure things out.

09:50.155 --> 09:52.389
Seriously? That is so nice of you.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.291
Uh, but just a heads-up.

09:54.292 --> 09:56.727
I like to start my morning
off with a hit of weed,

09:56.728 --> 09:59.396
so how sensitive are
your smoke detectors?

09:59.397 --> 10:00.864
Very.

10:00.865 --> 10:03.399
Cool. I'll take the
batteries out before I smoke.

10:09.598 --> 10:11.559
What are you doing up so early?

10:11.560 --> 10:12.377
Couldn't sleep.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.818
I was up all night texting Bobby,

10:13.819 --> 10:14.988
but he won't text me back.

10:15.321 --> 10:17.420
Well, maybe because it
was the middle of the night

10:17.421 --> 10:18.688
and he hasn't gotten them yet.

10:18.689 --> 10:19.922
Oh, no, he got them.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.424
I keep seeing those three dots,

10:21.425 --> 10:23.693
like he's gonna say
something, but then he doesn't.

10:23.694 --> 10:25.428
And it happened, like, ten times.

10:25.429 --> 10:27.230
And look.

10:27.231 --> 10:29.098
He posted this on Instagram.

10:29.099 --> 10:31.501
Aw, he looks so sad.

10:31.502 --> 10:33.169
"That moment you realize

10:33.170 --> 10:35.872
when you're all alone in this world."

10:35.873 --> 10:38.307
He needs to stop acting like a victim.

10:38.308 --> 10:40.143
He needs to stop letting
life happen to him

10:40.144 --> 10:41.244
and start living it.

10:41.245 --> 10:42.530
You know, I just want him to know

10:42.531 --> 10:43.743
that I think he could do anything

10:43.744 --> 10:45.047
if he just believed in himself.

10:45.048 --> 10:46.749
But why didn't you just tell him that?

10:47.818 --> 10:50.653
Say something nice to my brother?

10:50.654 --> 10:52.588
You're such an only child, Maxine.

10:53.724 --> 10:54.791
My bad!

10:54.792 --> 10:57.059
Ooh, I hope that didn't wake you up!

10:58.028 --> 10:59.395
I promise you,

10:59.396 --> 11:01.898
letting Nekeisha stay here
is gonna get old really soon.

11:01.899 --> 11:03.733
You're better off just
feeling guilty, Maxine.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.435
No, it's too much.

11:05.436 --> 11:07.804
Last night, I dreamt that
some poor mother and her kids

11:07.805 --> 11:10.072
got kicked out of this place
just so we could move in.

11:10.073 --> 11:11.374
Oh, we got nothing to worry about.

11:11.375 --> 11:13.276
No families lived in this
place before we moved in.

11:13.277 --> 11:14.610
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

11:14.611 --> 11:15.788
This building used to be a nursing home

11:15.789 --> 11:17.067
for people on Medicaid.

11:18.281 --> 11:19.819
Yeah, if those people had families,

11:19.820 --> 11:21.828
they wouldn't have been stuck here.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.620
Girl!

11:24.621 --> 11:27.063
Does she have people over
this early in the morning?

11:27.064 --> 11:28.105
Really?

11:28.106 --> 11:30.693
You're surprised Nekeisha
isn't an amazing houseguest?

11:30.694 --> 11:31.961
Shh.

11:31.962 --> 11:33.563
Girl, don't tell me
you feeling the pressure

11:33.564 --> 11:35.198
from the establishment
to vote your gender.

11:35.199 --> 11:37.547
Look, in theory, my policies do align

11:37.548 --> 11:39.168
with the Democratic Socialist Party.

11:39.169 --> 11:42.438
- Mm-hmm.
- And I do want to "Feel the Bern."

11:42.439 --> 11:44.907
But I have to hold
it down for my ladies.

11:44.908 --> 11:47.743
What is this, The Tavis Smiley Show?

11:47.744 --> 11:49.745
Who are you?

11:49.746 --> 11:52.014
Who am I? I'm the person
who owns this place.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.316
Oh, okay.

11:53.317 --> 11:55.818
Well, then, I'll make
sure to get the grand tour.

11:55.819 --> 11:59.054
Is it just this room and another
little room in the back? Done.

12:00.890 --> 12:03.226
Did I do something to you?

12:03.227 --> 12:04.660
Vanessa,

12:04.661 --> 12:06.429
that's Jerrod and Maxine.

12:06.430 --> 12:08.464
Maxine, Jerrod, this is my girl Vanessa.

12:08.465 --> 12:09.398
Hi.

12:09.399 --> 12:10.833
So what are you guys doing?

12:10.834 --> 12:12.335
Braiding hair.

12:12.336 --> 12:13.636
Huh.

12:13.637 --> 12:15.003
Cool, cool.

12:18.241 --> 12:20.076
Um, about how long is that gonna take?

12:20.077 --> 12:22.777
Shouldn't be more than six hours or so.

12:23.946 --> 12:26.349
Cool, cool.

12:26.350 --> 12:27.984
Um, you know what, Maxine?

12:27.985 --> 12:29.784
I'm just gonna go back to bed.

12:38.227 --> 12:39.762
Um...

12:39.763 --> 12:41.864
does anybody else see a
little girl standing here,

12:41.865 --> 12:43.599
or is it just me?

12:43.600 --> 12:45.234
That's Susie.

12:45.235 --> 12:46.502
Okay, well...

12:46.503 --> 12:48.170
Hey, little Susie.

12:48.171 --> 12:49.272
How are you feeling?

12:49.273 --> 12:50.373
She don't talk.

12:50.374 --> 12:52.340
Not since the fire.

12:55.411 --> 12:57.213
Uh...

12:57.214 --> 12:58.880
did you start the fire?

13:07.023 --> 13:10.326
Well, tell her to stop staring at me.

13:10.327 --> 13:13.329
Jerrod, one of the rules
while you living with me

13:13.330 --> 13:16.165
is that you have to respect my guests,

13:16.166 --> 13:18.868
'cause they are an
extension of Nekeisha.

13:18.869 --> 13:21.737
Oh, my God, why is there a pile
of hair on my cutting board?

13:21.738 --> 13:25.407
Oh, that is also an
extension of Nekeisha.

13:29.412 --> 13:30.880
Is Bobby here?

13:30.881 --> 13:32.481
Well, if it isn't Cain

13:32.482 --> 13:34.549
checking on his dead brother Abel.

13:36.218 --> 13:39.121
Did you see your brother's Instagram?

13:39.122 --> 13:41.824
It's dark, Jerrod.

13:41.825 --> 13:43.559
Yeah, he's being very dramatic.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.595
I just wanted to tell him
that he could do anything

13:45.596 --> 13:47.196
if he just put his mind to it.

13:47.197 --> 13:48.831
Well, why didn't you just say that?

13:48.832 --> 13:49.799
I did say that.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.660
Just more aggressive,

13:50.661 --> 13:52.168
'cause I was trying to prove a point.

13:52.169 --> 13:53.536
And, you know, the
way you two coddle him

13:53.537 --> 13:54.470
may not be helping.

13:54.471 --> 13:55.471
Lower your voice.

13:55.472 --> 13:57.839
You know, Bobby's still sleeping.

13:58.774 --> 14:00.276
It's 11:30, Ma.

14:00.277 --> 14:02.578
You ever think that maybe
removing his safety net

14:02.579 --> 14:04.046
may inspire him to do more?

14:04.047 --> 14:06.082
Well, everybody doesn't
respond to tough love.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.084
I yell at you, you rise to the occasion.

14:08.085 --> 14:11.253
I yell at Bobby, he
dies to the occasion.

14:11.254 --> 14:13.656
That's not your first time
saying that, is it, Dad?

14:13.657 --> 14:15.825
Well, I been tossing it around.

14:15.826 --> 14:18.661
You know, when you were little

14:18.662 --> 14:20.296
and I tried to coddle you,

14:20.297 --> 14:23.165
you said, "Affection is for the weak."

14:23.166 --> 14:26.167
That was your first complete sentence.

14:27.703 --> 14:29.438
Just because Bobby
doesn't have your strength,

14:29.439 --> 14:31.807
that doesn't mean he doesn't
have any strengths at all.

14:31.808 --> 14:33.275
He keeps his room tidy.

14:33.276 --> 14:35.411
He folds up all of his
clothes very neatly.

14:35.412 --> 14:37.913
I told him if he keeps working hard,

14:37.914 --> 14:40.381
he can get a job at Old Navy.

14:42.685 --> 14:44.754
He was dealt a bad hand in life.

14:44.755 --> 14:46.188
How were we dealt different hands?

14:46.189 --> 14:47.990
His room was, like, ten
feet across from mine.

14:47.991 --> 14:49.691
But your room had a heating vent.

14:51.427 --> 14:54.597
And I stopped smoking
right before you were born.

14:54.598 --> 14:58.100
That makes a difference, I hear.

14:58.101 --> 14:59.769
Have you thought about it like this?

14:59.770 --> 15:01.270
What if you removed his crutch?

15:01.271 --> 15:03.673
Like, what would happen if you
kicked Bobby out of the house?

15:03.674 --> 15:05.642
Kick me out?

15:06.109 --> 15:07.843
Jerrod, you already got me
kicked out of one neighborhood.

15:07.844 --> 15:09.612
Now you're trying to get
me kicked out another one?

15:09.613 --> 15:11.781
- Bobby?
- Bobby?

15:11.782 --> 15:13.115
Bobby? Bobby!

15:13.116 --> 15:14.617
Man, save it! You're not
better than me, Jerrod.

15:14.618 --> 15:16.085
I never said I was, man.

15:16.086 --> 15:17.853
Look, no one needs to worry
about Bobby Carmichael,

15:17.854 --> 15:19.922
'cause Bobby Carmichael about
to set the world on fire.

15:19.923 --> 15:21.656
But no thanks to any of you.

15:24.060 --> 15:25.795
Well, except Mom and Dad.

15:25.796 --> 15:26.962
Go get 'em, son!

15:26.963 --> 15:29.799
We love you!

15:29.800 --> 15:31.933
There's bees outside. I
got to leave out the back.

15:34.637 --> 15:38.074
♪ And I don't want the
world to see me ♪

15:38.075 --> 15:41.544
♪ 'Cause I don't think
that they'd understand ♪

15:41.545 --> 15:44.714
♪ When everything's
made to be broken... ♪

15:44.715 --> 15:46.916
Okay, this has gone on long enough.

15:46.917 --> 15:48.784
Okay, good. I'm gonna
go kick Nekeisha out.

15:48.785 --> 15:50.419
No, no, no, Jerrod. Let me handle this.

15:50.420 --> 15:52.822
I want her to know that she
can do more with her life, too,

15:52.823 --> 15:55.624
but I want to present it
in a more inspirational way.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.593
- Oh, inspirational.
- Cool, it'll be fun.

15:57.594 --> 16:00.062
It's like watching
Dangerous Minds, but look.

16:00.063 --> 16:01.030
Here's a tip.

16:01.031 --> 16:02.331
If she starts pulling your hair,

16:02.332 --> 16:04.499
just go limp until it's all over.

16:05.868 --> 16:07.670
Damn, I like the acoustics in there.

16:07.671 --> 16:09.939
Everything about this
apartment is perfect.

16:09.940 --> 16:12.708
It used to be.

16:12.709 --> 16:15.678
So, have you started looking
for a new place to live yet?

16:15.679 --> 16:17.713
I searched on Craigslist,
but everything in the area

16:17.714 --> 16:19.148
is just out of my price range.

16:19.149 --> 16:21.717
Have you been on there
lately? It got creepy.

16:21.718 --> 16:24.386
It's nothing but guys
looking to bang other guys

16:24.387 --> 16:27.089
while their wives are at work.

16:27.090 --> 16:29.658
You know, if you want a
nice place of your own,

16:29.659 --> 16:32.228
you can have one; you
just need to have a plan.

16:32.229 --> 16:34.163
Okay, well, what's my plan?

16:34.164 --> 16:37.433
Well, that's the part that
you are supposed to figure out.

16:37.434 --> 16:39.568
Um, what...

16:39.569 --> 16:41.337
What do you want to do in life?

16:41.338 --> 16:42.904
Live in an apartment.

16:44.907 --> 16:47.910
Uh, okay, more specifically,
what are you good at?

16:47.911 --> 16:51.447
I can tell when a conversation
is organically over.

16:51.448 --> 16:52.915
How you feeling about this one?

16:52.916 --> 16:55.584
It's close.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.620
Look, you are really
great at doing hair.

16:57.621 --> 16:58.988
That's a great career.

16:58.989 --> 17:00.723
Oh, no, see, Vanessa
doesn't pay me for that.

17:00.724 --> 17:02.558
I just hooked her up
'cause she's my girl.

17:02.559 --> 17:04.292
But you know you can
get good money for that.

17:04.294 --> 17:05.961
All you have to do is
take a cosmetology course,

17:05.962 --> 17:07.061
and you get your license.

17:07.063 --> 17:08.230
And how much does that cost?

17:08.231 --> 17:09.198
Uh, I don't know.

17:09.199 --> 17:10.332
Like, a few thousand dollars.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.467
"A few thousand dollars"?

17:11.468 --> 17:12.968
I thought I was trying to make money.

17:12.969 --> 17:15.938
That sounds counterintuitive.

17:15.939 --> 17:17.873
Well, you can take out a loan.

17:17.874 --> 17:20.409
You know, you think of it
as an investment in yourself.

17:20.410 --> 17:21.977
So, Maxine, you want me to borrow money

17:21.978 --> 17:24.613
to pay somebody to teach
me what I'm already good at,

17:24.614 --> 17:27.749
so I can find a job to pay
back the money with interest?

17:30.119 --> 17:33.154
You've got a week on our
couch, and then you're out.

17:34.919 --> 17:36.425
I got us an apartment!

17:36.426 --> 17:37.660
- Ooh, you did?
- Thank God!

17:37.661 --> 17:39.158
Because Maxine is trying to get me

17:39.159 --> 17:42.444
to start meeting my potential,
and it sounded exhausting.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.267
That's great, Bobby. Where?

17:45.268 --> 17:46.468
Same place we was at before.

17:46.469 --> 17:47.703
You got our apartment back?

17:47.704 --> 17:49.472
I marched back into
that landlord's office

17:49.473 --> 17:51.169
and accused him of being a slumlord,

17:51.170 --> 17:53.076
and I said he was doing
discriminatory practices.

17:53.077 --> 17:55.110
And then I threatened to take
it to the housing authority.

17:55.111 --> 17:57.313
- And that worked?
- No, it did not.

17:57.314 --> 18:00.049
But as I was leaving, I saw some
police tape on the door, right?

18:00.050 --> 18:01.617
And I'm like, "Uh,
what happened in there?"

18:01.618 --> 18:03.018
He was like, "A murder."

18:03.019 --> 18:04.920
I said, "What? You'll never
be able to rent that place out.

18:04.921 --> 18:06.355
I'll take it."

18:06.356 --> 18:09.024
So, what, you got cheaper rent
because there was a murder?

18:09.025 --> 18:11.060
Even better, it's free.

18:11.061 --> 18:12.447
Look, I was willing

18:12.448 --> 18:14.230
to clean up the aftermath,
which come to find out

18:14.231 --> 18:15.431
is the job of the building super.

18:15.432 --> 18:16.732
The landlord was like, "Man, I'm tired

18:16.733 --> 18:17.967
of cleaning up crime scenes."

18:17.968 --> 18:20.101
I was like, "Not me."

18:23.172 --> 18:25.808
So now I got a job.

18:25.809 --> 18:29.410
Dang, Bobby, you living
the American dream.

18:30.913 --> 18:33.482
Nah, baby, we both living the dream.

18:33.483 --> 18:36.552
See, Jerrod, it took you
years to get a nice place,

18:36.553 --> 18:39.021
a good job and a girl to come home to.

18:39.022 --> 18:42.157
Took me all of 20 minutes.

18:42.158 --> 18:44.026
That's right.

18:44.027 --> 18:45.995
Bobby's on the rise,
and I'm coming for you.

18:45.996 --> 18:47.463
And soon as you know it,

18:47.464 --> 18:50.431
I'm gonna be gentrifying
your ass up out of here!

18:52.001 --> 18:54.036
Now, Nekeisha, let's storm out.

18:54.037 --> 18:57.271
Oh, storming out is the only
way I know how to leave a room.

19:04.713 --> 19:07.049
Well, that was a little aggressive.

19:07.050 --> 19:08.284
No, are you kidding me?

19:08.285 --> 19:09.979
I've actually never
been more proud of him.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.787
Actually I've never
been more proud of me.

19:11.788 --> 19:13.355
I hurt my brother's feelings so bad,

19:13.356 --> 19:15.491
it inspired him to make his life better.

19:15.492 --> 19:16.958
I'm a hero.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.762
Hey, you want to go make love to a hero?

19:25.942 --> 19:27.458
You're messing my torque up.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.760
Bobby, there's no torque
involved; we're lifting a couch.

19:29.761 --> 19:31.138
You're throwing off my equilibrium.

19:31.139 --> 19:33.130
Okay, now you're just
using physics words.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.466
Damn, y'all wouldn't last
a second in the workforce.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.359
I mean, the real workforce.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.494
Not none of that white
collar stuff you do.

19:39.495 --> 19:42.063
I like to live by the motto
"Work smarter, not harder."

19:45.968 --> 19:47.802
Well, good luck with that.

19:47.803 --> 19:50.272
We gonna see how that
serves you once they invade.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.307
What-what are you talking
about? Once who invades?

19:52.308 --> 19:53.608
Oh, you'll see.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.610
You'll see once they arrive.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.612
But by then, it's gonna be too late.

19:58.714 --> 20:00.448
You know, he keeps
saying stuff like that,

20:00.449 --> 20:02.250
and I'm starting to
think he knows something.

20:02.251 --> 20:04.352
Well, look at this place.

20:04.353 --> 20:06.354
Just look at it.

20:06.355 --> 20:08.356
Look at this!

20:08.357 --> 20:10.458
Will you just look?

20:12.428 --> 20:15.397
I'm sorry, this looks just like
the last place y'all lived in.

20:15.398 --> 20:16.665
Nasty.

20:16.666 --> 20:18.967
Just nasty!

20:18.968 --> 20:20.835
Are these bullet holes?

20:20.836 --> 20:22.470
If I put a frame around it,

20:22.471 --> 20:24.172
actually it'll be a modern art piece

20:24.173 --> 20:27.375
with a powerful message about Ferguson.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.148
What's up?

20:33.149 --> 20:35.016
Yep, I'm the new super.

20:36.519 --> 20:38.987
Well, can you describe the rat?

20:38.988 --> 20:41.056
Okay, how big is it?

20:41.057 --> 20:43.792
Like a golf-ball big
or a basketball big?

20:43.793 --> 20:45.727
Ooh.

20:45.728 --> 20:47.295
You got a bucket and some string?

20:47.296 --> 20:48.897
Perfect, I'll be right up.

20:48.898 --> 20:51.601
