00:04.352 --> 00:06.919
- I noticed your brother Leon
was in the Kings.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.138
- Proud to say he broke out
of that life.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.661
- Maybe Leon could help us.

00:09.705 --> 00:11.881
Our best shot is to put someone
on the inside.

00:13.622 --> 00:16.233
- Leon!
- It ain't my blood; I'm okay!

00:18.192 --> 00:20.629
- CFD's next commissioner,
Carl Grissom.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.326
- I look forward
to scrutinizing

00:22.370 --> 00:24.894
every aspect of the CFD.

00:24.937 --> 00:27.070
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.985
I'm just going through a lot.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.727
- You are gonna wish you hadn't
stabbed me in the back.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.514
- Ooh!

00:37.907 --> 00:40.692
Sorry.
- No problem.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.434
- I was--nothing I've haven't
seen before, though, you know?

00:43.478 --> 00:45.871
This is--no need to cover up.

00:45.915 --> 00:49.005
- I'm not covering up, just
putting on my station gear.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.747
- Totally, I know--

00:52.704 --> 00:54.750
- Um, I was thinking
about throwing Kyle

00:54.793 --> 00:56.012
a birthday party at Molly's.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.535
- Hey, great, you know what?

00:57.579 --> 00:59.581
Get enough people and I'll get
you the Club Mix for free.

00:59.624 --> 01:02.366
Hey, how long have
you two been together now?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.716
- Three months.
- Wow.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.545
- Isn't the Club Mix
always gratis?

01:07.589 --> 01:09.808
- Hey, Levantini,

01:09.852 --> 01:12.376
you left your wet towel
in front of my locker again.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.031
Clean up after yourself,
please.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.163
- What are you, my wife?

01:17.642 --> 01:19.905
- Squad 3, Ambo 61, Truck 81,

01:19.949 --> 01:21.820
Engine 51, Battalion,
structure fire...

01:21.864 --> 01:22.995
- "All units,"
that's us right?

01:23.039 --> 01:24.388
- Yes.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.347
- Uh-uh, that's our call.
Second shift's on duty.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.218
- Oh, except we're
not changed yet, so--

01:28.262 --> 01:30.133
- So come on, second shift,
let's move.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.224
- Herrmann, try to aim the
water at the fire this time.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.139
- Don't be a sore loser,
Levantini!

01:57.334 --> 01:59.771
- Hey, where's the fire?

01:59.815 --> 02:01.599
- I think it's one
of the first floor units.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.253
Uh, the hallway's real smoky!

02:03.297 --> 02:06.082
- Okay,
anybody know which unit?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.824
Okay, people, back behind me
on the other sidewalk.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.434
Come on, let's go.

02:10.478 --> 02:11.914
- Hey, uh, we got one
of those lockboxes,

02:11.957 --> 02:13.872
so please don't start
busting down doors, huh?

02:13.916 --> 02:15.265
- Yeah, I see it.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.180
- Hey Chief,, smoke's coming
from everywhere.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.443
- Yeah, looks like it's
coming out of the H Vac system.

02:19.487 --> 02:22.142
Squad, do a primary search
on the first floor hallway.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.795
Casey,
lockbox right there.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.493
- Got it.
Truck and Squad.

02:25.536 --> 02:28.757
- 51, be ready with
the hose line.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.150
- Copy!

02:38.419 --> 02:40.290
- Fire department,
evacuate the building!

02:42.553 --> 02:45.817
Fire department, call out!

02:45.861 --> 02:47.645
It's not this one.

02:47.689 --> 02:48.690
Down here!

02:51.040 --> 02:53.999
- Casey, fire's in unit 106!

02:54.043 --> 02:55.479
- On our way.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.265
- Fire department, call out!

02:58.308 --> 02:59.570
- Help, please!

02:59.614 --> 03:01.920
- Someone's in there.
Stand back!

03:15.369 --> 03:17.588
This thing is Fort Knox!

03:17.632 --> 03:20.330
- Hey, Casey, we can't
breach the door!

03:20.374 --> 03:22.071
We need those lock keys!

03:25.901 --> 03:28.208
- I don't have them.
Box is empty.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.600
Repeat,
there's no building keys.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.364
- Hey, Cruz!

04:06.942 --> 04:08.204
- Hey!

04:08.248 --> 04:09.727
Fire department, call out!

04:09.771 --> 04:11.947
- Help!
- Call out!

04:11.990 --> 04:14.428
- I'm in here!

04:14.471 --> 04:17.300
- Fan out!

04:19.737 --> 04:22.174
Fire department, call out!

04:23.393 --> 04:25.613
- Fire department!

04:27.963 --> 04:30.966
- Fire's in the master bedroom!

04:31.009 --> 04:33.795
- In here!
I'm in here!

04:35.797 --> 04:37.973
- I got him!

04:41.672 --> 04:43.326
You gotta get me out of here!

04:45.372 --> 04:46.721
- You okay?

04:46.764 --> 04:48.636
- Yeah, I was in the shower
when the alarm went off!

04:48.679 --> 04:50.725
It got so hot so fast
out there!

04:50.768 --> 04:52.248
- We got to move.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.207
All right,
I'm gonna walk you out there.

04:55.251 --> 04:58.385
- We're going out there?
- Yeah.

04:58.428 --> 05:01.431
Don't worry, I'm gonna stand
between you and the fire.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.696
- Just get ready and stay low.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.004
Okay, put that over your face.

05:10.919 --> 05:13.965
51, we're coming out
of the bathroom!

05:14.009 --> 05:15.663
Can you cover us?

05:15.706 --> 05:17.665
- Yeah, ready when you are!

05:17.708 --> 05:19.057
- All right.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.321
- Ready? On my count!

05:21.364 --> 05:23.584
One, two, three!

05:26.064 --> 05:27.892
- This way!
Come on!

05:35.987 --> 05:38.642
- See?
Nothing to worry about.

05:41.515 --> 05:44.779
- Hey, Chief,
the fire's out in 106,

05:44.822 --> 05:46.694
but we better check
that unit above.

05:46.737 --> 05:49.087
It looks like there was
an electrical fire in the wall.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.524
- Okay, check all the units.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.569
I don't care how many doors
you have to break down.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.832
- All right.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.008
- Hey, Chief,
are we too late?

05:57.052 --> 05:59.968
- No, you can help
with the overhaul.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.448
- Ah, it figures.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.101
First good fire
in our district in weeks

06:03.145 --> 06:05.234
and we're tied up with
a heart attack ten blocks away.

06:05.277 --> 06:08.411
- Lieutenant, any idea why
the lockbox would be empty?

06:08.455 --> 06:09.717
- What are you talking about?

06:09.760 --> 06:11.414
- No building keys.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.809
- Hey, Tedesco, when did
we inspect this lockbox?

06:14.852 --> 06:16.027
- Last month, wasn't it?

06:16.071 --> 06:18.465
- Last month,
the keys were there.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.857
- We better report this.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.817
- There's a cop on scene.
Go give him a statement.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.997
Okay, get to it.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.922
- Stella Kidd, right?
- Yeah.

06:40.965 --> 06:43.533
- I'm Keith,
from the fire this morning.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.579
- Oh, yeah, sure, I remember.
How you doing?

06:45.622 --> 06:47.668
- Great, thanks to you.

06:47.711 --> 06:50.584
I'm sure people bring you guys
stuff all the time,

06:50.627 --> 06:52.673
so I tried to be creative.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.283
- Beer!

06:54.326 --> 06:56.111
Man,
that's really sweet of you.

06:56.154 --> 06:59.767
- I make it at home.
- Wow, thank you!

06:59.810 --> 07:00.985
See you around, Keith.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.596
- Wait, Stella?

07:02.639 --> 07:04.511
- Mm-hmm.

07:04.554 --> 07:07.601
- Any chance I could
take you out some time?

07:07.644 --> 07:10.299
Dinner or a drink?

07:11.126 --> 07:14.477
- Um, no.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.741
This is a classic thing,

07:17.785 --> 07:20.483
you know, asking a firefighter
out after a save.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.398
There--there's even
a name for it.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.836
It's called a rescue crush,
but it will pass, trust me.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.491
- Just curious.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.624
How many days in a row would
I have to show up

07:30.667 --> 07:33.148
to prove that it's not
just a "rescue crush,"

07:33.191 --> 07:35.193
and that I actually think
we'd have fun together?

07:35.237 --> 07:37.500
- Uh, I don't know.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.328
- Ten, maybe 20?

07:39.371 --> 07:42.026
Um...

07:42.070 --> 07:47.902
I, uh, I work at Molly's, uh,
on Wolcott tomorrow night.

07:47.945 --> 07:52.123
If you wanna swing by,
I'll have a drink with you.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.561
- I will be there.

07:54.604 --> 07:57.172
- Okay.

07:57.215 --> 08:00.697
- Enjoy the beer.
- Thank you, Keith.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.661
- Hey, hey,

08:07.704 --> 08:09.967
I'm gonna need your schedule
for inspecting all

08:10.011 --> 08:11.795
the lockboxes in the district.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.144
Considering this morning,

08:13.188 --> 08:14.319
it might be a good idea
to make sure

08:14.363 --> 08:16.887
that they're all
in good shape.

08:19.803 --> 08:22.153
- The hell's this?

08:28.856 --> 08:30.640
- What could we do for you,
Commissioner?

08:32.816 --> 08:34.557
- Chief Boden.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.822
Time to repay the favor.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.438
- So what's this favor
you think I owe you?

08:46.482 --> 08:48.005
- You've already forgotten
your troubles

08:48.049 --> 08:51.226
with the
Assistant Deputy Commissioner?

08:51.269 --> 08:53.402
I'm the one,
per his father's request,

08:53.445 --> 08:54.795
got Gorsch off your back.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.666
- You're the one who
put Gorsch on his back!

08:56.710 --> 08:58.233
- If you're still confused

08:58.276 --> 09:00.148
why I needed someone
keeping an eye on 51,

09:00.191 --> 09:02.063
I'm happy to have
that conversation.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.717
- Let's just talk about
why you're here.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.328
- The police commissioner's
office reached out to me

09:06.371 --> 09:09.374
and requested a little
"inter-departmental synergy."

09:09.418 --> 09:11.420
Apparently there's some cop
on the intelligence unit

09:11.463 --> 09:13.553
that's trying to tarnish
CFD's image

09:13.596 --> 09:16.381
and I need you to make sure
it doesn't stick.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.427
- Is it Hank Voight?

09:18.470 --> 09:21.082
- How'd you know?
- 'Cause he just walked in.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.088
- In here.
- Thank you.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.437
- Hey.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.092
Commissioner,
Sergeant Hank Voight,

09:31.135 --> 09:33.398
Detective Halstead, Upton.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.749
- Sir, who--
what's this all about?

09:35.792 --> 09:37.446
- We've had a spate
of break-ins

09:37.489 --> 09:39.448
over the past few weeks,
pretty bold crew.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.754
I mean,
they'll hit day or night,

09:40.797 --> 09:43.800
any type of location,
business, residential,

09:43.844 --> 09:47.238
and there doesn't seem to be
a lot that can stop these guys.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.632
We had no idea
how they were getting in

09:49.676 --> 09:52.417
till you guys reported
the empty lockbox.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.071
- Every place that's been hit
has a lockbox.

09:54.115 --> 09:56.683
When we check them out,
building keys are still inside.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.728
- So you think somehow somebody
got keys to the building

09:58.772 --> 10:00.295
from the lockbox,
steal what they can,

10:00.338 --> 10:01.818
then replace the keys
to cover their tracks?

10:01.862 --> 10:03.559
- Exactly, until today,
they started a fire

10:03.603 --> 10:05.387
and they had to leave in
a hurry.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.084
- Sergeant, can you skip
to the part where you try

10:07.128 --> 10:09.696
and convince me that there's
a firefighter behind all this?

10:09.739 --> 10:13.308
- Well, firefighters know which
buildings have lockboxes

10:13.351 --> 10:15.658
and they're the only ones
who have access to them.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.573
I mean, building owner
doesn't even have a key.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.488
- There's only one key
per company

10:19.531 --> 10:20.837
and they're all accounted for.

10:20.881 --> 10:23.797
- All right, look, there's been
a robbery

10:23.840 --> 10:25.668
roughly every 72 hours,

10:25.712 --> 10:29.106
and it's always been during
CFD's second shift.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.499
- So you're saying

10:30.542 --> 10:32.370
some firefighter from
the second shift

10:32.414 --> 10:34.416
is swiping the key
from his company's rig

10:34.459 --> 10:36.897
and using it to commit
a robbery while on shift?

10:36.940 --> 10:38.942
- Well, more likely, they're
passing the key off

10:38.986 --> 10:41.292
to an accomplice who's then
carrying out the robbery.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.860
- Even then, you'd have
to return the key to the rig

10:43.904 --> 10:45.514
before anyone noticed.

10:45.557 --> 10:47.472
- Well, it helps that
every robbery has taken place

10:47.516 --> 10:49.779
within five minutes
of Engine 66.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.609
- The ones that roll up late
to the fire.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.306
- Yeah.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.004
- What do you need from us?

10:57.047 --> 11:00.790
- We want to embed a friendly
firefighter inside 66

11:00.834 --> 11:02.270
to help us sniff out
the bad guy.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.751
- An informant.

11:08.058 --> 11:10.278
- Okay.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.845
Well, it's better than
a few dozen cops

11:11.888 --> 11:13.368
storming the place
with a warrant

11:13.411 --> 11:14.978
and start jamming up
my firefighters.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.981
Gives us a little control
over the situation.

11:22.986 --> 11:26.163
- Do you have someone in mind?

11:26.207 --> 11:28.383
- Joe Cruz.
- No.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.124
Never gonna happen.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.039
- Joe Cruz is not
your biggest fan,

11:32.082 --> 11:33.867
not after what you put
his brother through.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.999
- Well, I don't need Joe Cruz
to like me.

11:36.043 --> 11:40.395
The point is I trust him and
I know he can handle himself.

11:40.438 --> 11:41.701
- Then Joe Cruz it is.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.224
- Whoa,
he's one of my best guys.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.573
You're not gonna use him
as a pawn

11:44.616 --> 11:46.401
in whatever pissing match
you got into

11:46.444 --> 11:48.882
with the police commissioner.
- Severide!

11:57.151 --> 11:59.457
- I don't know,
I can't imagine a firefighter

11:59.501 --> 12:01.285
being involved
in something like that.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.331
- I feel the same, but
we've had bad apples before.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.549
It happens.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.856
- If it's true,
we need to find out, right?

12:06.900 --> 12:10.251
- Yeah, but why do I have
to be the snitch?

12:10.294 --> 12:11.643
- You don't.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.254
No one can force you
to do this, Cruz.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.211
It's your call.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.778
To hell with
Voight and Grissom.

12:17.301 --> 12:19.434
Do you want to talk
to Voight first,

12:19.477 --> 12:23.394
before you decide?
Lay out some ground rules?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.486
Look, all I need to know is...

12:28.530 --> 12:30.750
do you want me to do this?

12:36.581 --> 12:38.975
- I think it's the right thing
to do.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.373
Done.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.302
- Why are they sending you
to another house?

13:01.345 --> 13:02.999
- For how long?
- Which house?

13:03.043 --> 13:04.871
Listen, you guys,

13:04.914 --> 13:06.437
I lost a piece of equipment
last week,

13:06.481 --> 13:08.875
so Chief is pulling me off
Squad and he's making me work

13:08.918 --> 13:10.746
a couple shifts
on the engine company.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.401
- What'd you lose?
- Guys,

13:13.444 --> 13:16.143
Cruz left a thermal camera
behind on a call,

13:16.186 --> 13:18.493
so Chief is sending him to work
on an engine company

13:18.536 --> 13:20.974
as a disciplinary measure,
standard procedure.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.585
- Period, end of discussion.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.071
You got this.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.516
- All right, let's move in.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.523
- Does this kind of stuff
happen often?

13:48.566 --> 13:50.873
Getting shifted
to another house?

13:50.917 --> 13:52.875
- Once in a while.

13:52.919 --> 13:56.705
- Yeah, Severide
wasn't happy about it.

13:59.664 --> 14:02.015
Look who actually came.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.583
- Of course he did.
He's smitten.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.938
- And very adorable.

14:11.981 --> 14:14.114
- I'll be back.
- Bye.

14:20.772 --> 14:24.385
- Is that the guy
from the fire?

14:24.428 --> 14:27.083
- Yeah.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.873
- If you're still carrying
a torch,

14:33.916 --> 14:36.266
you might want to
talk to her.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.661
- Nah, it's all good.

14:40.662 --> 14:44.927
This business with Grissom,
it feels somehow personal.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.930
He takes my best man off squad.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.976
If Cruz isn't back
after next shift,

14:50.019 --> 14:51.586
we're gonna have a problem.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.980
- It sounds like Voight's the
one who came up with the plan,

14:54.023 --> 14:56.243
not Grissom.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.940
You don't like the guy.
I don't blame you.

14:57.984 --> 15:01.465
But this situation...

15:01.509 --> 15:05.426
seems to me Grissom's trying
to do right by the CFD.

15:05.469 --> 15:08.081
- Or he's trying to cover
his political hide.

15:15.131 --> 15:17.742
- Anyway, I--I can't say
much more about it

15:17.786 --> 15:21.007
but I just wanted you to know
I'm working with him.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.791
I don't want you
to find out later.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.575
- Damn, Joe.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.186
Hank Voight?

15:26.229 --> 15:27.709
- Look, I know.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.667
He's not forcing my hand.
It's strictly voluntary.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.974
- Look, you can keep me in
the dark about it if you want,

15:32.018 --> 15:33.802
but the fact that Voight's
working the case,

15:33.845 --> 15:35.282
it's gotta be something ugly.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.632
- Yeah, but I'm
just gathering information.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.416
I'm not doing anything
like you did for him.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.115
I'm not infiltrating a gang.
I'm not even wearing a wire.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.812
- The danger's
only part of it, Joe,

15:43.855 --> 15:46.119
and that ain't even
the worst part.

15:46.162 --> 15:49.470
- What's worse than danger?
- Living a lie.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.951
- I--I'm not gonna live a lie.
- You said undercover.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.039
- As--as in I have
a cover story.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.823
- Also known as a lie.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.651
Come on, Leon--

15:56.694 --> 15:58.870
- Listen to me!

15:58.914 --> 16:00.307
I know what I'm talking about.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.657
Whenever Hank Voight
asks you to lie for him,

16:02.700 --> 16:04.398
that ain't no small thing.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.661
Now y-you gotta maintain
that lie.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.663
You gotta believe it yourself.

16:09.881 --> 16:12.232
- Leon,

16:12.275 --> 16:14.277
I'm just trying to do
a good thing here

16:14.321 --> 16:15.975
like you did back then.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.280
- All right, yo, good,

16:17.324 --> 16:19.152
and, like, I hope you do,

16:19.195 --> 16:21.154
but just know that there will
be other consequences

16:21.197 --> 16:22.894
that you won't see coming.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.548
You can count on that.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.018
Uh, hi, I'm Joe Cruz.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.542
- What can I do for you,
Joe Cruz?

17:01.585 --> 17:03.196
- Guess I'm floating here
for a while.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.198
- Oh, right, new guy.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.895
Megan Tedesco.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.767
- Tedesco, you see this note
from first shift?

17:09.811 --> 17:11.726
Charlie said the brakes
are getting touchy.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.293
- Charlie's a dumbass.

17:13.336 --> 17:14.729
He doesn't know how
to feather the pedal.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.209
- How's it going?
You riding with us?

17:16.252 --> 17:17.471
- Uh, yeah, yeah,
I'm Joe Cruz.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.908
- Suggs.
Welcome aboard 66.

17:19.951 --> 17:23.085
She ain't much,
but she's ours.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.960
- Ugh, oh wow,
look at this d-bag.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.962
- That's Kehoe.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.747
- This is a firefighter?
- Uh-huh.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.401
- Morning, morning!

17:34.444 --> 17:36.664
- Jeez, Kehoe, do you have
to be so loud first thing?

17:36.707 --> 17:38.883
- Shut up.
What's up, man?

17:40.537 --> 17:43.062
- This is Joe Cruz.
He's riding with us today.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.194
- Oh, what's up, Joe?
- Hey.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.978
- Where you coming from?

17:47.022 --> 17:50.199
- Oh, I'm uh, based out of
Squad 3 over on Firehouse 51.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.767
Love the car.
Z51 package, am I right?

17:52.810 --> 17:55.683
- And you know it.
Worth every nickel.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.207
- Damn.

17:59.991 --> 18:02.255
- Tell me something.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.039
How bad does a Squad hot shot

18:04.083 --> 18:07.129
have to screw up to land
himself on a lowly engine?

18:07.173 --> 18:09.175
Uh,

18:09.218 --> 18:11.307
I left a thermal camera behind
in an incident,

18:11.351 --> 18:14.136
so my chief's got me carrying
my sheets for a while.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.139
- Better not lose
any of my gear.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.141
What are you all standing
around for?

18:19.185 --> 18:20.795
Get those regulators inspected.

18:20.838 --> 18:23.406
- Uh, hey, uh, Lieutenant,
I'm Joe Cruz.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.017
- You too, Cruz, let's go.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.458
- Don't sweat Pierson.

18:31.501 --> 18:34.809
As lieutenants go, he's
actually a pretty good guy.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.183
- Grissom's motorcade.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.446
- He must be here to see
Chief Boden again.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.754
- You gonna join him?
- Not if I can help it.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.367
- How'd things go with him
last shift?

19:12.325 --> 19:14.196
- Can't really talk about
the details.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.895
- Forget the details,
I just mean, like...

19:19.854 --> 19:22.857
It must be tricky seeing him.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.775
Emotionally, you know, after
all that went on with you two

19:27.818 --> 19:28.950
and your dad.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.169
- Wasn't an issue.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.475
The conversation
was all business.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.695
- Hmm.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.611
Okay.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.743
Good.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.013
- Any word yet from your guy?

19:49.057 --> 19:51.146
- No, Voight wants him
to maintain radio silence

19:51.190 --> 19:53.366
until he's got
some hard intel to share.

19:53.409 --> 19:56.195
He's just a few hours
into his first shift at 66.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.109
- His first and last, you mean.

19:58.153 --> 19:59.763
- Well, Voight says
this operation

19:59.807 --> 20:01.200
may take a while
to play out.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.245
- He also said that this crew
is pulling a robbery

20:03.289 --> 20:04.420
every shift cycle.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.335
So if your guy doesn't see
that lockbox key

20:06.379 --> 20:09.164
wander off before daybreak,
then Voight's theory is shot.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.253
We pull the plug,
having held up our end,

20:11.297 --> 20:14.125
and cleared the CFD
of wrongdoing.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.999
- We on the same page?

20:18.042 --> 20:21.263
- Uh, no, we're not.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.873
With all due respect,
Commissioner,

20:22.917 --> 20:24.440
you're going to have
to be more patient.

20:24.484 --> 20:26.355
You promised Voight
that we'd help him

20:26.399 --> 20:28.705
get to the bottom of this and
that's what we're going to do.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.359
We're not just gonna
pay lip service.

20:30.403 --> 20:31.795
We're gonna get answers

20:31.839 --> 20:33.188
even if we don't like
what we find out.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.103
- Look, I'm not gonna
let these guys use us--

20:35.146 --> 20:38.846
- I have got a man with
his neck on the line,

20:38.889 --> 20:42.284
so we're gonna do this my way.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.243
The right way.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.250
- I expect to be notified

20:51.293 --> 20:53.643
the moment you hear anything
from 66.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.177
- All right, man.
See you later, all right?

21:06.221 --> 21:08.441
Let's go.

21:09.442 --> 21:12.053
- Seems like you got
a pretty tight crew here.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.576
- Yeah, you know,
we get along.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.579
Tedesco's a real ball buster,
but she's earned it.

21:16.623 --> 21:17.885
Hell of a firefighter.

21:17.928 --> 21:20.148
- Cool, cool.

21:20.191 --> 21:23.107
Yeah, the guys at 51
are pretty awesome too.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.022
You, uh, you meet any of them

21:25.066 --> 21:26.981
at that Cortland fire
the other day?

21:27.024 --> 21:28.765
- Missed that one.
Wasn't here last shift.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.289
- Oh, so you weren't on duty.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.726
-  No, I had to have
a buddy swap with me

21:32.769 --> 21:34.336
so I can get a crown put in.

21:34.380 --> 21:37.513
- Huh.
Okay, good.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.341
- Good that I needed a crown?

21:39.385 --> 21:41.300
- Uh, oh no, I, um...

21:41.343 --> 21:42.997
good that you got it
taken care of.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.520
It's, uh, easy for that
kind of thing

21:44.564 --> 21:46.827
to fall through the cracks on
a firefighter's schedule.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.481
Man, true enough.

21:51.266 --> 21:55.836
- Hey, uh, I brought
you guys some shirts.

21:55.879 --> 21:59.143
- Oh, damn.
You're the Slamigan guy!

21:59.187 --> 22:00.362
- Yeah, yeah.
That's my side hustle.

22:00.406 --> 22:03.974
- That's cool! Thanks.
- Yeah.

22:04.018 --> 22:07.630
- Hey, um,
speaking of side hustle,

22:07.674 --> 22:08.979
what's the deal with Kehoe?

22:09.023 --> 22:10.372
- What do you mean?

22:10.416 --> 22:12.374
- He win the Powerball
or something?

22:12.418 --> 22:14.115
How much overtime's
a guy gotta work

22:14.158 --> 22:15.899
to roll up in that Corvette?

22:15.943 --> 22:18.685
- Do you work for the CFD
or the IRS?

22:18.728 --> 22:19.990
- Hey, Lieutenant.

22:20.034 --> 22:22.428
- Why are you prying
into Kehoe's finances?

22:23.994 --> 22:25.822
Mind your own business.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.522
Yes, sir.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.267
Kehoe and his brothers

22:36.311 --> 22:39.183
inherited a big dairy farm
down in Watseka.

22:39.227 --> 22:42.012
Guy's a legit millionaire,
swear to God.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.536
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.668
- Well, what's he still
doing crawling hallways?

22:45.712 --> 22:47.017
- He just loves firefighting.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.715
You can't tear him away.
He'd do it for free.

22:48.758 --> 22:51.108
- Huh.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.241
- Hey, I don't know
why the lieutenant

22:53.284 --> 22:54.851
came down on you like that.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.593
He's just...

22:57.637 --> 22:59.073
just been a little off lately.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.397
- There's no food.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.355
- Ah, damn it!

23:20.399 --> 23:22.096
Today was Cruz's turn
to make the lunch

23:22.139 --> 23:24.315
and we forgot
to reassign it.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.450
- Ramen's for lunch.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.234
It was Cruz's day.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.367
- Damn it.

23:35.239 --> 23:38.155
- So are you gonna see
our friend Keith again?

23:38.199 --> 23:41.811
- Uh, I don't think so.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.334
- Why not?

23:43.378 --> 23:47.338
- Well, uh,
there's the rescue crush thing.

23:47.382 --> 23:50.951
Plus he runs a fitness center
that has gyms all over,

23:50.994 --> 23:53.214
so he is traveling all
the time.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.564
And how is a guy
that cute single?

23:55.608 --> 23:58.306
There has to be something wrong
with him, you know?

24:02.615 --> 24:04.268
- What?

24:04.312 --> 24:06.096
- That's a lot of excuses.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.446
- Not to mention you haven't
had a date

24:07.489 --> 24:10.318
since the whole
Severide break up.

24:12.494 --> 24:13.974
Come on.

24:14.017 --> 24:17.151
Give adorable Keith a chance.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.589
- He is pretty adorable.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.722
- Yes.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.332
He is!

24:24.375 --> 24:28.075
- Ambulance 61, Squad 3,
Truck 81.

24:28.118 --> 24:30.947
Person trapped,
8817 West Ohio.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.313
- Calm down, calm down!

24:49.357 --> 24:51.315
- Stop!

24:51.359 --> 24:53.230
Theresa, come on, stop!
Stop!

24:53.274 --> 24:55.276
- Hey, everybody, calm down!

24:55.319 --> 24:56.799
- That bastard deserves it!

24:56.843 --> 24:58.018
- Yo, you're all right?

24:58.061 --> 24:59.498
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!

24:59.541 --> 25:02.152
- We didn't call 911 for me.
We called it for her.

25:02.196 --> 25:04.067
- Just breathe.

25:08.724 --> 25:10.465
Help me!

25:19.169 --> 25:20.910
- Help me!
I can't hold on!

25:20.954 --> 25:23.870
- Brett, grab a blanket.
- Got it.

25:23.913 --> 25:27.090
- This is all your fault.
He was in bed with her!

25:27.134 --> 25:28.570
- Okay, all right!

25:28.614 --> 25:29.919
All right, easy, easy.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.355
- Faye and I were together.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.096
When we heard Theresa
come home, Faye panicked.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.924
She thought she could hide
on the windowsill.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.013
I told her there was not enough
room, but she just bolted out!

25:37.057 --> 25:39.015
- If she dies,
it's on you, Henry!

25:39.059 --> 25:40.626
- Hey, hey, hey!
Just get back here!

25:40.669 --> 25:42.018
Come on, come on.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.805
Help me!

25:45.848 --> 25:48.198
- Hang on!

25:52.594 --> 25:53.769
- I can't move.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.162
- All right,
I won't let you fall.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.642
Just hold onto the pipe.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.339
- My hands are stuck!

26:01.690 --> 26:04.388
- Hey, Casey,
hold off on the basket,

26:04.432 --> 26:06.216
her hands are frozen
to the pipe.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.304
- Try a blow torch,

26:07.348 --> 26:08.784
heat up the metal.

26:08.828 --> 26:10.481
- It might be safer
to take some of the pipe.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.571
Hey, Cruz, grab me a sawzall!

26:12.614 --> 26:14.529
- Cruz isn't here, Lieutenant,
I got it!

26:14.573 --> 26:16.400
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

26:16.444 --> 26:18.402
- I got ya.
- Okay.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.195
- Battery's dead, Lieutenant!

26:28.238 --> 26:31.198
- Damn it, Cruz would've
checked that first thing!

26:32.765 --> 26:35.594
Hey! Hey, yo, you!

26:35.637 --> 26:37.247
What's in the mug?

26:37.291 --> 26:38.727
- Me?
Coffee.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.729
- Tony, get that mug up here!

26:56.092 --> 26:57.485
- All right.
- Uh-huh.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.277
- Please.

27:07.321 --> 27:08.801
- Oh, we got it.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.281
- We're good.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.678
- He's got it.

27:16.722 --> 27:20.508
- There.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.474
- Faye, you okay?

27:30.518 --> 27:31.475
- I'm sorry.
- You're okay.

27:31.519 --> 27:32.825
- I--I panicked.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.522
- You're okay.
That's what matters, okay?

27:36.785 --> 27:39.788
- Sorry about that, Lieutenant.
- That can't happen again!

27:42.051 --> 27:44.445
To hell with Grissom.
Cruz should be here.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.027
- All right.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.943
- Man, that's the third
stove fire this week.

28:03.986 --> 28:05.814
I'm tempted to let
the next one burn.

28:05.858 --> 28:07.337
- Man, we get a lot
of those around here.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.165
Old folks in the neighborhood
who live alone,

28:09.209 --> 28:10.993
but insist on cooking.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.995
What you gonna do?

28:13.039 --> 28:15.389
- Let's get some lunch.

28:17.434 --> 28:21.134
- Hey, uh, hey, 51's
a much busier house, I bet.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.745
- Uh, yeah, yeah, uh,
we--we get some crazy ones.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.878
- Man, what I'd give...

28:25.921 --> 28:28.750
- Uh, damn,
left my phone in the cab.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.839
I'll catch up to you guys.

29:31.639 --> 29:35.599
- Hey, Kelly.

29:35.643 --> 29:36.949
- If you're looking for Voight,

29:36.992 --> 29:38.602
he just went into
Chief Boden's office.

29:38.646 --> 29:39.908
- Not looking for Voight
or Boden.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.302
Came to see you.

29:42.345 --> 29:45.131
How you been?

29:45.871 --> 29:48.003
- So you came
to make small talk?

29:49.265 --> 29:51.441
- Just wanted to know
how you are, that's all.

29:54.836 --> 29:57.099
Been a rough stretch.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.629
I can't tell you how many times

30:05.673 --> 30:07.196
I've been in some meeting
or other

30:07.240 --> 30:10.896
and still think to myself...

30:10.939 --> 30:13.115
better call Benny,

30:13.159 --> 30:15.944
see what his take is on it.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.384
- Well, I'm fine.

30:21.428 --> 30:23.517
If that's what
you want to know.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.346
- I know things
have been tense between us

30:26.389 --> 30:30.219
and, uh, your Chief and I
aren't always on the same page,

30:30.263 --> 30:33.005
which doesn't make it
any easier.

30:34.484 --> 30:40.012
But if there's anything
you need, say the word.

30:41.535 --> 30:45.147
Benny would expect me
to look out for you.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.937
And that's what I plan to do.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.694
- Cruz, Cruz!
It's the best part coming up.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.653
Where they tear the vault out
of the police station

31:12.696 --> 31:14.611
and drag it through
the streets of Rio!

31:14.655 --> 31:16.309
- You know, I'm not
a scientist or anything,

31:16.352 --> 31:18.093
but I feel like the physics
in these movies

31:18.137 --> 31:19.878
aren't exactly 100% accurate.

31:19.921 --> 31:24.621
- Tedesco, I've seen you drive.
You defy physics every day.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.929
- Okay, shut up!

31:29.757 --> 31:31.193
- Okay, hey, Cruz,

31:31.237 --> 31:34.327
give us a definitive ranking
of the whole series.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.242
- Of the "Fast and the Furious"
movies?

31:36.285 --> 31:37.373
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah!

31:37.417 --> 31:39.158
And you better get it right.

31:42.552 --> 31:46.817
- Um, is, uh, is "Tokyo Drift"
considered part of the canon?

31:46.861 --> 31:48.602
- Yes.
- Hell yes, it is.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.562
You know what? I'm gonna--

31:52.606 --> 31:54.564
I'm gonna mull that over
while I hit the head.

31:54.608 --> 31:56.349
- All right, cool.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.338
- Damn it,
I don't understand.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.645
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

32:31.688 --> 32:34.953
I feel like they weren't
straight with us.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.128
You're right.

32:36.171 --> 32:37.956
You're right.
It doesn't matter now.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.088
All right, look, uh,

32:40.132 --> 32:43.222
I'll be there right
after my shift.

32:43.265 --> 32:45.398
We'll figure this out.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.617
I promise.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.664
Cruz!

32:50.707 --> 32:51.970
What the hell are you doing?

32:52.013 --> 32:53.319
- I'm so sorry, I...

32:53.362 --> 32:55.190
- That was
a private conversation!

32:55.234 --> 32:57.062
What are you
sneaking around for?

32:57.105 --> 32:58.585
You wanna know my business?

33:02.023 --> 33:04.069
My wife's cancer is back!

33:05.984 --> 33:08.987
We thought she beat it but
the tests came back positive.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.122
It's in her blood now!

33:20.085 --> 33:23.784
There, you're up to speed.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.799
- It's Cruz.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.583
Hey, Joe.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.020
- Hey, Chief.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.804
- Sergeant Voight is here too.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.110
- Hey, Joe, safe to talk?

33:45.153 --> 33:46.807
- Uh, yeah, yeah,
for--for a minute anyway.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.201
- All right, what's happening
over there at 66?

33:49.244 --> 33:52.117
- Not a lot.
Good house, good people.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.814
These guys
are born firefighters.

33:53.857 --> 33:56.077
- You don't think any of them
could be a suspect?

33:56.121 --> 33:57.861
- I don't think so.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.472
One guy wasn't even on shift
during the condo break-in,

33:59.515 --> 34:01.343
so he couldn't
have passed the key.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.345
For a minute, I thought it
might've been the lieutenant

34:03.389 --> 34:06.087
but just turned out to be
some heavy personal stuff.

34:06.131 --> 34:09.134
- All right, listen, Joe, you
got to remain objective, okay?

34:09.177 --> 34:11.136
Just get them
to open up to you.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.007
- Sergeant, this is
a total wash, all right?

34:13.051 --> 34:15.923
I-I'm betraying
good people here.

34:17.055 --> 34:20.188
- Hey, don't push him.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.757
- Look, just hang tight
till the end of the shift.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.237
We'll talk about it
on the other end.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.890
Can you do that?

34:26.934 --> 34:28.718
- Yeah, I can do that.

34:28.762 --> 34:32.070
- All right.
- Okay, Joe, get some rest.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.986
Sup, Suggs?

36:03.030 --> 36:04.727
- What you doing out here,
Cruz?

36:07.252 --> 36:09.167
- Nothing.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.391
- Come on.

36:20.874 --> 36:22.919
Let's get back to the movie.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.359
- Yeah.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.308
- What's up?

37:04.613 --> 37:08.748
- Nothing, I'm, uh,
just gonna stretch my legs,

37:08.791 --> 37:10.228
maybe get some fresh air.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.273
- Pretty cold out there.

37:20.194 --> 37:21.674
- Getting late, huh?

37:21.717 --> 37:24.285
- Yeah.

37:24.329 --> 37:27.157
- I think I'm gonna
just hit the sack.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.029
- Yeah.

37:29.072 --> 37:31.292
That's a good idea, yeah.

37:31.336 --> 37:32.859
Me too.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.447
- Hey, Stella.

37:57.884 --> 38:01.583
I just wanted
to say you were right

38:01.627 --> 38:03.281
about the Grissom situation.

38:04.804 --> 38:07.415
Hit harder than I thought,
you know?

38:07.459 --> 38:10.679
- Yeah, of course.

38:10.723 --> 38:13.116
- Um, made me think.

38:21.386 --> 38:25.172
- Um, we're road-tripping it
out to Wilmot today,

38:25.215 --> 38:27.000
do some down-market
snowboarding.

38:27.043 --> 38:31.309
You know, hopefully I don't,
uh, break my arm.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.354
- That sounds fun.

38:34.224 --> 38:37.532
Uh, thanks again for
checking in about Grissom.

38:37.576 --> 38:41.884
Like I said, it made me think.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.060
- I'm glad.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.019
I'll see you next shift.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.289
- You okay?

38:56.856 --> 38:58.858
- Yeah.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.382
I'll be a hell of a lot better
once Cruz gets back.

39:11.392 --> 39:14.787
- Hey, you, uh, you joining us
again next shift, Cruz?

39:14.830 --> 39:16.702
- Oh, uh, I don't know.

39:16.745 --> 39:20.575
Um, I don't know what they
got in store for me after this.

39:20.619 --> 39:23.709
- Well, if you do come back,
you gotta bring the Slamigan.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.406
I need to see that thing
in action.

39:25.450 --> 39:28.191
- Yeah, yeah, sure thing.
You'll love it.

39:32.152 --> 39:35.024
Uh, check you guys later.

39:35.068 --> 39:38.027
- Stay out of trouble.
- See you around, Cruz.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.956
- Hey, what are you doing?
What is that?

39:54.000 --> 39:55.958
What you got there?

39:56.002 --> 39:58.178
The hell's your phone
doing out here?

40:03.183 --> 40:05.185
- What happened, Suggs?

40:06.186 --> 40:07.796
- What happened with what?

40:07.840 --> 40:09.755
- That key's been gone
all night.

40:09.798 --> 40:11.452
- What are you talking about?

40:11.496 --> 40:12.845
- I saw you, Suggs.

40:12.888 --> 40:16.152
I watched you pass that
lockbox key to someone.

40:16.196 --> 40:17.632
But it should be back
by now, right?

40:17.676 --> 40:19.025
Third shift
might need that key.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.244
- You didn't see a damn thing.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.204
- You know,
I totally discounted you

40:24.247 --> 40:27.468
because you weren't even on
shift during the last robbery.

40:27.512 --> 40:30.732
But you just worked
first shift instead, right?

40:31.516 --> 40:33.343
Passed that key off
the night before the robbery?

40:33.387 --> 40:35.084
- Cruz, I don't know what
you think you saw--

40:35.128 --> 40:36.912
- I know what I saw.

40:39.524 --> 40:42.701
I wish I hadn't.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.529
- Did you record me?

40:48.837 --> 40:50.970
Cruz, you can't do this to me.

40:51.013 --> 40:53.407
I'm not a bad guy.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.669
- Sorry.
