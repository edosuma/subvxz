WEBVTT

02:07.961 --> 02:13.257
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things

02:13.425 --> 02:18.262
Dreams of me and you

02:18.430 --> 02:19.514
Nice.

02:19.681 --> 02:24.852
It seems, it seems
That l can't shake those memories

02:25.020 --> 02:28.898
l wonder if you feel the same way too

02:29.066 --> 02:30.775
Girl, l do

02:32.736 --> 02:36.113
Oh, shit, it's work.
Wait, turn it down. Turn it down.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.657
Hello?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.450
- Jesse.
- What?

02:39.618 --> 02:43.830
I have to give a sound bite for
the L.A. Times, so no noise for a minute.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.750
I might actually get a call too,
so if it's noisy, l'll be on a call.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.794
Okay. Ready?

02:49.962 --> 02:53.840
All right. This year, all trends
will head toward simplicity and comfort.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.175
Things like Roku, Vudu...

02:56.343 --> 03:00.429
cookbooks and casual wear
will see a spike in the market.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.639
Can l have a drag?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.059
Yeah.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.979
- That's perfect. Thanks.
- What'd you do?

03:08.146 --> 03:10.982
Seriously, can you not sit still
for like two minutes?

03:11.149 --> 03:13.526
We talked about this.
No more smoking.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.028
- Hey, Disney Hall.
- Yeah. l'm not doing it.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.155
- Not doing what?
- L am not doing that.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.158
- Lt's just a building.
- Lt's not trending.

03:21.994 --> 03:25.496
Wanna go titty for titty? My arms
are longer. My boobs are smaller.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.790
- Focus on driving.
- L am focused on dri...

03:29.209 --> 03:32.211
- Great.
- Jess, that place is amazing.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.213
I'm on a really important call.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.591
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. l don't know what to say.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.302
- Thank you for calling.
- Ls that about the job?

03:39.469 --> 03:41.345
Awesome. Thank you so much, man.

03:41.513 --> 03:44.348
Thank you, yeah. Talk soon.
Okay, bye.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.893
- Was that about the magazine job?
- No.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.062
But, Celeste,
a swell came in last night.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.397
Northwest.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.233
Apparently, it is overhead
and it is glassy.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.861
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Malibu.

03:57.029 --> 04:00.698
- The waves are crushing right now.
- Are you talking about surfing?

04:00.866 --> 04:02.700
Yeah. Why are you not more excited?

04:02.868 --> 04:05.703
I'm so psyched.
I just thought that was about that job.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.956
- The illustration job.
- Right. They haven't called me back.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.750
I'm not dying to work there.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.294
Doesn't seem
like you're dying to work at all.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.255
I'm putting together a show.
You know it takes time.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.925
- L know.
- Okay. Can l drop you off at home now?

04:19.091 --> 04:21.636
- L just missed a wave.
- At some point, l feel...

04:21.803 --> 04:23.346
- Missed another.
- All right.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.014
- Two more just went by.
- Okay.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.224
- L could be on those.
- Take me home.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.994
- Be back by 6 so you can shower?
- Why shower?

04:47.162 --> 04:49.372
- Beth and Tucker, dinner.
- Right. Yep.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.708
- Have fun shredding your glassy peel.
- Oh, so wrong.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.251
- Love you.
- Love you.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.214
Thank you.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.841
Did you guys end up
seeing that band last week?

05:01.009 --> 05:02.259
Oh, yeah. Fuck Your Mom?

05:02.427 --> 05:04.178
- They were for reals, dude.
- Yeah.

05:04.346 --> 05:08.391
Get them as your wedding band.
They're loud but probably pretty cheap.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.644
Or the band that opened,
Please Us, Christ. They were good.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.105
- They shredded.
- Lt's done. l told you.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.940
We got the greatest swing band.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.943
- Sugarfoot and the Swingin' Scrod.
- We actually didn't.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.404
We talked about this.
Swing is so late '90s.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.573
We're not gonna do that.
We're not doing it. We're not....

05:24.741 --> 05:27.118
l'm gonna eat your face,
l love you so much.

05:27.285 --> 05:30.621
- We'll talk about it later.
- And so now we turn to the menu.

05:30.789 --> 05:35.501
Yes, l think the best idea
is to get enchiladas and tacos...

05:35.669 --> 05:37.795
and then we split the two, ja?

05:37.963 --> 05:41.632
This is a clinical choice,
but l must object to your strategy...

05:41.800 --> 05:44.552
for l wish to enjoy the tacos alone.

05:44.720 --> 05:49.140
No, but that is not fair.
As long as l can have some bites, ja?

05:49.307 --> 05:51.642
- But we know about your bites, don't we?
- No.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.894
You take one and then you take many.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.647
- Ja, this is true.
- Ja, you do.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.983
This is true.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.406
We can't do this anymore.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.160
Oh, God.

06:09.327 --> 06:13.748
Honey, weddings are so stressful,
but l promise you, we know.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.708
- You guys will be fine.
- Just fine.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.003
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, we are fine.
- No, we're good.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.465
What the fuck are you two doing?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.301
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.678
What do l mean?
You two are not together.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.014
It's not normal, okay?

06:30.182 --> 06:32.683
You guys have been separated
for six months.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.102
You're getting divorced, all right?

06:35.270 --> 06:39.315
And you spend every day together
hanging out as if, like, it's no big deal.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.485
- Guess what. lt's fucking weird.
- L don't think this is...

06:42.652 --> 06:46.781
- Tell them what you think.
- Let's not play charades. lt's weird.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.700
- There's no charades being played here.
- No charades.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.327
- No charading.
- No.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.914
We are separated, and we're friends.
You guys should be happy.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.208
We fought all the time.
We don't anymore.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.377
You don't have to choose sides.
It's the perfect breakup.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.712
Yeah, everyone's cool.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.714
- Everyone is not cool.
- Not cool.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.966
No one is cool here.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.011
I'm sorry.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.722
I can't do this anymore. l'm sorry.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.183
- Baby.
- Beth.

07:16.561 --> 07:21.398
- Beth is so angry.
- Ja, she is Ã¼ber angry.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.110
This is too weird.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.749
Hey, C.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.379
- Can you help me with something?
- What?

07:48.260 --> 07:50.386
Don't wanna pressure you
into anything...

07:50.554 --> 07:53.222
but this gentleman is awfully lonely
and just...

07:53.390 --> 07:55.683
Here, l'll show you how it works. Just...

07:55.851 --> 07:57.059
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.395
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.980
Oh, he likes that.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.023
Wait, be quiet.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.943
My roommate's next door.
Don't make any sound.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.028
- All right. Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.365
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.244
- Dude.
- That was a big one.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.662
Yeah.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.589
- Beth and Tucker are crazy.
- Crazy.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.882
- Right?
- Yes.

08:28.049 --> 08:32.720
I mean, it is not weird
that we hang out all the time.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.722
Do you think it's weird?

08:34.890 --> 08:38.558
- No. You're my best friend.
- Yeah. You're my best friend too.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.437
Last time we didn't speak
for more than a week was in 1 0th grade...

08:41.605 --> 08:43.188
when you went
to Space Camp Canada.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.024
That was a brutal five weeks.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.986
The antigravity training was crazy,
though.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.281
But l missed you.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.866
Me too.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.120
Look who's back.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.040
- His recovery time is insane.
- Oh, no.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.375
He's a college boy
and he's ready to rock.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.419
Here we go.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.424
- L'm exhausted.
- Yeah, me too.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.636
- Dessert was good, right?
- Oh, so good.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.013
- Night.
- Night.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.476
Hey, it's kind of chilly tonight.
How's your heat in there?

09:21.061 --> 09:24.438
- Lt's fine. l'm fine.
- Okay. Good.

09:24.606 --> 09:28.984
Hey, sorry l'm still living back here.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.528
Stay as long as you want.
It's your studio.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.199
- Also, it's really nice having you here.
- For me too.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.701
- Night.
- Night. Love you.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.453
Love you too.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.194
- Are you gonna...? No.
- Here's your chai latte.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.490
- Can l get a large coffee to go?
- Soy cappuccino for David.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.786
Excuse me, sir? Sir.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.496
Sir. Yeah, you. Sorry.

10:22.664 --> 10:26.875
You do realize that you just cut
in front of a bunch of people, right?

10:27.043 --> 10:29.545
- L'm so sorry. l didn't know.
- Did you not know?

10:29.713 --> 10:32.381
- L'm just in a big rush, so....
- So you did know.

10:32.549 --> 10:36.635
- And l'm sure everyone here is in a rush.
- Okay, is this really happening?

10:36.803 --> 10:40.014
She was looking at the pastries,
so l just... I thought....

10:40.181 --> 10:42.641
lt's not just her.
It's everyone behind her.

10:42.809 --> 10:47.855
If you wanna ask every single person
if it's okay that you cut, be my guest.

10:48.023 --> 10:51.025
Don't assume your time
is more important than others'.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.903
Thank you for the lecture.
Have a great day, everybody. Not you.

10:57.991 --> 11:02.453
American culture is dying, and there's
an unrelenting appetite in this country...

11:02.620 --> 11:07.333
for reality shows,
talentless pop stars like Riley Banks...

11:07.500 --> 11:09.752
recycled, bloated movie franchises.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.421
The more we consume crap,
the more we want crap.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.714
You are what you eat.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.717
It sounds utterly hopeless.
Is there an upshot?

11:16.885 --> 11:20.220
I think there will be a groundswell
movement toward simplicity.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.849
People will crave spiritual,
mental and physical nourishment.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.602
- Lt'll be back to basics.
- A lot to chew on.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.355
For more on this gloomy
but interesting subject...

11:29.522 --> 11:32.441
look out for Celeste Martin's
new book, Shitegeist...

11:32.609 --> 11:34.360
on bookshelves Monday.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.987
- L had dinner with the drama club.
- Who's that?

11:37.155 --> 11:40.115
Beth and Tucker.
They left in the middle of dinner...

11:40.283 --> 11:43.369
because they don't approve
of me and Jesse hanging out.

11:43.536 --> 11:47.956
It is so judgy. We're fine. lf we were gay,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

11:48.124 --> 11:52.169
- We'd just be friends.
- You are not ready to let go of each other.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.881
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- There's nothing wrong with it.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.676
- L mean, what do you think?
- Well, to be honest...

11:59.844 --> 12:01.887
Oh, my God.
We're signing Riley Banks?

12:02.055 --> 12:06.058
What the fuck, Scott?
I just trashed her on TV.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.144
That's why l wanted you to come in.
It's a huge account.

12:09.312 --> 12:13.190
We built this company so we didn't
have to sign accounts like Riley Banks.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.735
You and l may not have a company
if we don't take Riley Banks.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.655
I don't understand.
She's like a vagina and a hairdo.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.156
She's releasing a new CD.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.992
She wants us to do the branding
and merchandising.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.665
Fine. l'm gonna go eat my feelings.

12:29.833 --> 12:33.001
If you want my opinion,
l do think you should start dating.

12:33.169 --> 12:37.089
Scott, l'm fine.
I have so much time. l'm not worried.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.634
Do me a favor and get your fuck on
before you meet the next guy.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.595
What is that? What are you doing?

12:43.763 --> 12:47.599
Sorry. l was trying to be
your saucy gay friend.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.311
- Didn't feel good.
- No. Don't.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.523
The economic climate
is real bad, man.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.443
I think my business
is taking the hardest hit of all.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.612
It's brutal. ls it just me or
is nobody talking about it?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.073
- You sell weed, Skillz.
- Not for long, dude.

13:03.241 --> 13:06.326
You seen those weed pharmacies
on every fucking corner?

13:06.494 --> 13:07.870
They're killing me.

13:08.037 --> 13:12.499
I mean, l think l gotta branch out,
start working in methamphetamines.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.168
Or teach preschool, you know?

13:14.335 --> 13:17.671
I love kids, and l just, l don't know,
always wanted to do that.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.548
Sorry, dude.

13:19.716 --> 13:23.844
I know this is serious talky time,
but look at the fucking seat on that girl.

13:24.012 --> 13:27.848
- That is a party.
- L don't think it's over.

13:28.016 --> 13:31.477
- What? Her butt? No, it goes on forever.
- No, man. Me and Celeste.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.189
She's overwhelmed and confused,
but l think she's gonna come around.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.648
Oh, no. Really, pal?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.817
I mean, it's been a while, you know...

13:38.985 --> 13:41.695
but l think it's time to accept that
and move on.

13:41.863 --> 13:45.157
- Call that dime Veronica.
- No, dude. That was a one-time thing.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.910
Celeste does not know about it,
so don't tell her.

13:48.077 --> 13:52.247
I didn't know that was a hit-and-run.
It's not like you really liked her, so....

13:52.415 --> 13:54.333
She was cool, but she's not Celeste.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.960
Okay, but remember,
you can't reheat a soufflÃ©.

13:57.128 --> 14:00.214
- What does that mean?
- Lt's L.A. There's bettys everywhere.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.217
It's good to remind Celeste
you can pull a little wool.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.344
- Make her sweat a bit.
- Yeah, l guess.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.553
- How are you?
- Good.

14:06.721 --> 14:10.265
- So, what do you want, man?
- Maybe l just don't wanna start over.

14:10.433 --> 14:14.228
No, l meant, like, what do you want?
Do you want yogurt?

14:14.395 --> 14:18.899
Can l have a goji-berry-and-green-tea swirl
with yogurt chips and Cap'n Crunch?

14:19.067 --> 14:21.318
- Would you go out with my friend ever?
- No.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.488
Where's your wife?
You guys are here every day together.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.783
- We're actually separated.
- Oh, cool.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.577
I mean, bummer or whatever,
but, okay, l'll go.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.538
Just like that.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.914
Cool.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.667
You want it swirled or side by side?

14:44.467 --> 14:46.176
- What?
- L need to say one thing.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.679
Then l'm not gonna say
another word about it.

14:48.846 --> 14:53.141
I'm sorry l wigged on you at dinner. But
l think it's stupid you're not together.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.978
I do. You guys are best friends.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.438
That's the hard part.
Nothing else matters.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.232
Beth, l love Jesse dearly...

15:00.400 --> 15:03.527
but he doesn't have a checking account
or dress shoes.

15:03.695 --> 15:07.406
The father of my children will have a car.
You know?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.866
Jesse will always be my best friend.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.827
Okay. l said what l had to say.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.871
Not gonna say another word.
I just needed to say that.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.085
It's a huge mistake
that he's living in that guesthouse.

15:20.253 --> 15:25.465
- You are breaking his heart, slowly.
- Jesse is fine.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.301
He's fine.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.644
Hey.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.605
You're not working?

15:41.274 --> 15:44.192
You're watching
the Beijing Olympics again?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.695
And you're crying again.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.740
Matthias' wife died
in a car accident last year.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.952
Hey, did you finish that artwork
for the Pop Form website yet?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.705
No, it's not done yet.
I'm still working on it.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.875
- L think you're gonna like it.
- Can you finish it tonight?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.546
No. Actually....

16:04.714 --> 16:08.342
Sit down for one second.
I wanna tell you something important.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.635
Okay.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.721
Does it have something to do
with the work you owe me...

16:12.889 --> 16:15.432
that's late
that we were just talking about?

16:15.600 --> 16:20.646
Tonight l am going on a date.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.608
And l'm gonna date people.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.861
That's great.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.322
- Lt is?
- Yeah.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.700
No, Jess. Please don't cry again.
Good for you.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.207
- Doesn't bother you?
- No.

16:40.375 --> 16:44.211
Okay. Yeah, it's yogurt girl
from Yogurt Yurt.

16:44.379 --> 16:47.839
Yogurt girl. Yeah, she's cute.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.842
- She's really young, right?
- Super young, yeah.

16:51.010 --> 16:55.138
- But her body is, like, all-time.
- Okay, there's no need for that, but...

16:55.306 --> 16:57.349
Wow, that's great. That's really great.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.935
This is good.
You gotta crawl before you walk.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.896
She's not gonna be wifey number two,
but whatever.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.147
No. lt's just a date.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.068
Hey. Big move.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.319
I'm proud of you.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.406
- Thank you.
- Can l get up now?

17:13.574 --> 17:14.700
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.953
You're gonna be great. Call me after.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.413
No.

17:19.579 --> 17:23.083
I was in school, but l dropped out
because l wanna work in fashion.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.711
But it's really hard
to find a paid internship.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.797
So l went back to school,
and now l work at Yogurt Yurt.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.508
I'm looking to make money
doing something l love.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.468
I'm sure the universe has my back.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.804
The right thing will come along,
you know?

17:35.972 --> 17:40.308
- L mean, you get it, obviously, right?
- Totally.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.440
Oh, my God.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.446
Oh, my God, Jesse.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.099
"Do lt on My Face"?

18:21.934 --> 18:24.811
This song is about being who you are.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.647
Unless who you are sucks.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.941
Everybody shut up.

18:46.083 --> 18:50.045
They said it would be in new releases.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.673
Where is it?

18:56.719 --> 18:58.345
No.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.396
Now, that's what l call placement.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.570
You shouldn't steal it,
even if it is your book.

19:15.738 --> 19:18.073
I'm just rearranging some things.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.537
- There.
- You can't do that.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.872
- Yes, l can.
- An employee didn't pick you.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.457
Doesn't matter.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.293
Hey. Employee picks.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.587
- Congrats. That's awesome.
- Thanks.

19:32.755 --> 19:35.674
- What happened?
- Employee picks.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.719
Jesse?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.514
- Hey.
- Veronica.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.723
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.433
- How's it going?
- Good.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.102
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.312
- How you been?
- L've been good.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.398
- How have you been?
- Good.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.900
- You look great.
- Thanks. You too.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.611
What are you doing here?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.739
Checking out books.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.284
- Same.
- Yep.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.287
How's your clothespin collage going?

20:06.414 --> 20:07.956
You remember that.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.542
It's good. lt's good. Slow but good.

20:10.710 --> 20:14.421
Well, don't give it up,
because it's really unique and beautiful.

20:15.548 --> 20:19.050
- L hope that didn't sound too...
- No, no. That's really sweet and...

20:19.218 --> 20:21.386
- Good.
- Yeah, that means a lot. Thank you.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.680
You're welcome.

20:23.848 --> 20:27.142
I had so much fun with you that night.
I'm sorry l didn't call.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.561
I had a lot of fun too.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.605
Cool.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.440
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:33.608 --> 20:35.775
I have to find more places
to put my book.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.611
Veronica, these are my friends.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.820
- Celeste.
- Hi.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.196
- Beth and Tucker.
- Hi.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.489
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.618
- How are you? Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

20:44.785 --> 20:45.952
You wrote that book.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.080
I just read an excerpt online.
It's really compelling.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.043
- Thank you. That's very nice.
- You're welcome.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.546
Well, nice to meet you.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.340
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.549
- Bye.
- See you later.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.217
Bye.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.386
- Bye.
- What was that?

21:03.554 --> 21:04.638
Veronica.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.056
- Story?
- No story.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.391
Just a girl l met a little while ago.

21:08.559 --> 21:12.187
She's pretty.
She looks like a young me.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.939
Excuse me. Hi.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.942
Do you have any more copies
of this book Shitegeist...

21:17.109 --> 21:20.445
for me to give to my friends?
Because l heard it's excellent.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.043
- No, no.
- Just one second. Hey.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.212
- Just got out of the show.
- How was it?

21:37.380 --> 21:39.506
- Fucking dope.
- Hey, are you busy now?

21:39.674 --> 21:42.509
- No, l'm not busy.
- Can you help me build this dresser?

21:42.677 --> 21:44.094
- Okay.
- L can't do it alone.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.013
- All right, all right. Okay, bye.
- Jesse, l need you.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.223
I gotta go home.

21:48.391 --> 21:50.350
After the show, it's the after-party.

21:50.518 --> 21:54.270
I know, but she's got an lKEA dresser
she needs me to help her "build."

21:54.438 --> 21:55.522
Oh, it's like that?

21:55.690 --> 21:58.608
I told you, man,
she just needed a little bit more time.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.986
- L got this.
- Oh, she's about to get it.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.406
I'm in here. Fuck Sweden.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.784
What up?

22:07.952 --> 22:12.998
- Lt's easier to build the Brooklyn Bridge.
- We got this. lt's just a dresser.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.333
Fucking fuck. Fuck me!

22:17.253 --> 22:21.506
What, do they make a piece of furniture
that's impossible to build on purpose...

22:21.674 --> 22:23.800
just to fuck with you?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.011
Thank you.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.223
Wait.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.600
L've got it.

22:36.022 --> 22:39.816
- Perfect.
- Fucking layup.

22:40.985 --> 22:46.614
It's like Koons meets Basquiat meets....

22:46.782 --> 22:50.326
Serra meets...

22:51.245 --> 22:53.872
Corky from Life Goes On.

22:56.834 --> 23:01.046
- He's a vegan, you know.
- Oh, cherish.

23:01.213 --> 23:05.383
- That is so cute.
- You're cute.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.303
You're cute.

23:50.721 --> 23:54.015
Hey. What are you doing?

23:54.183 --> 23:56.142
I love you.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.478
Okay.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.159
That was a bad idea. So sorry.

24:13.327 --> 24:16.871
No, don't be sorry. lt was nice.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.791
Jess.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.417
Come on.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.838
Drinking and the dresser and....

24:25.005 --> 24:27.882
l think, you know....
We're seeing other people.

24:28.676 --> 24:31.302
Well, yeah, but just because....

24:37.977 --> 24:40.311
Oh, God.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.064
I'm an idiot.

24:43.566 --> 24:46.109
- L just thought...
- You thought what?

24:46.277 --> 24:50.113
Well, l wasn't clearly thinking,
or else l wouldn't have let that happen.

24:50.281 --> 24:52.949
You didn't think
we were getting back together.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.243
It's not like....

24:56.579 --> 25:00.206
You know, there's a guy
you can call at lKEA.

25:00.374 --> 25:03.835
He'll build your dresser for you.
You should call him.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.378
Probably fuck you too.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.213
- Oh, Jess.
- L'm a fucking idiot.

25:07.381 --> 25:10.675
Oh, Jess, come on. Jesse.

25:23.898 --> 25:31.898
Jess?

25:45.920 --> 25:48.630
Hey, Jess, it's me.

25:48.797 --> 25:53.593
I'm on my way to the airport,
but l wanted to talk to you.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.137
I don't know what happened last night.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.390
I hope you're okay.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.643
Okay, bye. Call me.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.410
Hey, you've reached Jesse.
Leave me a message.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.889
Hey, it's me again.

26:40.057 --> 26:43.601
I'm in San Francisco.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.436
And l miss you.

26:47.856 --> 26:51.025
Call me. Okay. Bye.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.488
I'm sorry.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.662
Of course.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.917
Stupid.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.796
Hey, you're back. l wanna talk to you.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.631
I know. l wanna talk to you too.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.175
Where have you been?
It's been like two weeks.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.844
There's so much to lay down.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.513
Pay-per-view porn is available
in Cantonese now.

27:20.681 --> 27:21.723
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:21.890 --> 27:25.768
I'm really near your house.
Can l just come by? lt's kind of important.

27:25.936 --> 27:29.564
There's 68 colleges in Boston.
Why were the kids in my group so dumb?

27:29.732 --> 27:32.567
I mean, they were, like,
barely making sense.

27:32.735 --> 27:37.572
- They were not speaking English.
- Hey. l really gotta tell you something.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.033
Actually, me too.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.826
Wait. Are you gay?

27:41.994 --> 27:44.370
Please tell me you're gay.
That'd be so funny.

27:44.538 --> 27:49.459
No. Not gay.
This is going to be hard to believe...

27:49.626 --> 27:52.962
- But you went on another date.
- L'm having a baby.

27:55.758 --> 27:58.885
- L'm having a baby.
- What do you mean?

27:59.845 --> 28:04.015
I'm having a child.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.393
With another person?

28:07.561 --> 28:09.187
Yes, with another person.

28:10.481 --> 28:12.482
Wait, what?

28:12.649 --> 28:14.859
Sorry. What...?

28:15.027 --> 28:18.112
What the fuck? With who?

28:18.280 --> 28:22.742
You met her, actually,
the other day at the bookstore.

28:23.994 --> 28:28.581
But that's not even physically possible.
That was two weeks ago.

28:28.749 --> 28:30.333
Yeah.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.588
Truth is,
l slept with her like three months ago.

28:38.342 --> 28:39.675
Shit. Okay.

28:39.843 --> 28:44.847
Well, l didn't know about that,
but that's not important right now. Okay.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.892
What do you need me to do?

28:48.602 --> 28:50.645
Oh, no. You don't have to do anything.

28:52.523 --> 28:55.149
I really wanna make it work with her.

28:57.611 --> 28:58.986
Excuse me one second.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.519
Hello.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.898
- What?
- L said, hello.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.608
Hi.

29:41.864 --> 29:46.784
- How's your practice?
- How's my practice?

29:46.952 --> 29:49.036
- Lt's fine.
- L'll get that mat for you.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.081
- Thanks.
- L see you here a lot.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.041
You've got a great Warrior 2.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.586
Your Chaturanga is,
like, incredibly balanced.

29:58.130 --> 30:02.467
I'm still working that position, but....
Are you single?

30:03.552 --> 30:06.804
Are you really doing this right now?
You're really doing this.

30:06.972 --> 30:11.476
I know. l'm gonna go for it. l don't do
this. lt's just happening. l'm gonna....

30:11.643 --> 30:13.936
- Gonna jump right in there.
- L'm jumping in.

30:14.104 --> 30:15.938
Captain Conversation.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.275
Do you...? Hey, l'm Paul. Put it there.

30:19.443 --> 30:20.735
- Celeste.
- Celeste.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.904
That's a great name.
So here's my card.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.823
That's my number, e-mail.
If you need to fax me...

30:25.991 --> 30:27.700
You bring cards to yoga?

30:28.243 --> 30:29.869
Hi. How are you? Come on in.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.413
Great flow today.

30:32.581 --> 30:37.293
- L'm not good at this. Little help?
- Financial analyst. Cool.

30:37.461 --> 30:40.296
Not really. lt's not that cool.
It's all right.

30:40.464 --> 30:44.592
- Did you tell me what you did for a living?
- No, l didn't.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.511
Well, will you? l'd love to know.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.888
I'm a trend forecaster. l forecast trends.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.933
Trend forecaster. Yeah.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.229
You serious?
I thought you were fucking with me.

30:56.396 --> 31:00.942
You traded in your Porsche for an Audi
because you're afraid you'll lose your job.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.779
You bought a Droid because
it makes you seem business-oriented...

31:04.947 --> 31:07.156
unlike the iPhone,
for teenage girls.

31:07.324 --> 31:10.409
You go to yoga because
you went to a sub-lvy League school.

31:10.577 --> 31:13.037
You spent the last 1 0 years
working long hours.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.790
You thought it was time
to do something spiritual.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.626
It was nice to meet you, Paul.

31:31.807 --> 31:32.848
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:33.016 --> 31:36.978
- Where were you on the New York call?
- L figured you could handle it.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.855
Yeah. Well, anyway,
the artwork came in from Berlin.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.983
- Lt's good, but it...
- Breaking news.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.027
Jesse is having a baby with some girl.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.157
Did you even know
he was seeing someone?

31:50.325 --> 31:52.827
No, it's somebody he slept with once
months ago.

31:52.995 --> 31:56.455
Now he's gonna try to "make it work."
Plane crash.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.666
I don't even know what to say.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.960
I'm so sorry, Celeste. Are you okay?

32:01.128 --> 32:03.713
Scott, l'm totally fine. Yes.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.464
- Are you?
- Yes.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.551
I wasn't gonna have his baby,
so good for him.

32:08.719 --> 32:11.470
I'm not in love with him anymore.
It makes it easier.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.140
- L have a date tonight, actually.
- That's great.

32:14.308 --> 32:17.476
Feel like it might be nice to go out
and be admired.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.354
I agree. Go be admired.

32:20.522 --> 32:24.150
Who knows? You may actually
simulate human emotion.

32:32.576 --> 32:33.909
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:34.077 --> 32:35.578
My foot actually pronates...

32:35.746 --> 32:38.748
so my lT band is strained
when l run, which is painful.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.584
The foot specialist
made me these orthotics.

32:41.752 --> 32:44.795
They shape around my foot.
They make it so much better.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.964
I cannot explain how amazing it feels.

32:47.132 --> 32:51.093
- L'm one of those people who...
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. My ex is here.

32:51.261 --> 32:52.553
Oh, we made eye contact.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.806
- Maybe he didn't see me.
- L think it's... lt's okay.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.017
- Nope, he saw me. He saw me.
- Lt's okay.

32:58.185 --> 33:01.020
He's coming over here now.
Know what? You should leave.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.688
- What?
- Yeah, you should go.

33:02.856 --> 33:05.024
- L'm not gonna leave.
- Lt would be better.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.735
It's too late because
he's here now. Hey.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.320
- Hey. How's it going?
- Good.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.156
- Thought l'd say hi. l'm Jesse.
- That's Mac.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.908
- Lt's Max.
- Matt.

33:14.076 --> 33:17.203
- Nope, Max.
- Nice. Cool.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.958
We're just eating. l'm on a date.
We're on a date. l'm dating.

33:23.126 --> 33:25.878
Oh, cool.
The puttanesca special is the bomb here.

33:26.046 --> 33:29.256
- Oh, good news. That's what l ordered.
- Nice. Cool.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.591
Who are you here with?

33:30.759 --> 33:33.469
Oh, l'm just rolling solo,
watching the Lakers game.

33:33.637 --> 33:35.262
- Lt's Kobe-LeBron, right?
- Yes.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.348
- So psyched.
- Yeah, man, epic.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.850
- TiVo'd it.
- Nice. Cool.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.228
- Well, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

33:42.396 --> 33:45.356
C, good to see you. Have fun.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.442
He's cool.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.738
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:54.491 --> 33:57.410
- Are you okay?
- What? Oh, nothing.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.833
Do you like bread?

34:06.336 --> 34:08.420
That was great.
Should we do it again?

34:08.588 --> 34:10.505
Wednesday? Sushi?

34:10.674 --> 34:13.801
- L don't think we should.
- Because of the mercury poisoning?

34:13.969 --> 34:17.054
- My acupuncturist said that's a myth.
- No. l think that....

34:17.222 --> 34:20.766
l think you could use a little more time
to get over your divorce.

34:20.934 --> 34:25.146
I mean, look, it took me a long time
to start dating after mine. l get it.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.649
I appreciate your concern, but l'm fine.

34:28.817 --> 34:32.027
I guess you're just
not a match for me, so....

34:33.655 --> 34:34.864
Yeah. Well....

34:36.533 --> 34:38.284
Have a good night.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.704
- Thanks. Okay.
- And good luck.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.126
Whatever.

35:12.402 --> 35:16.906
- Hi, honey. Beth.
- Hi. Hi.

35:17.073 --> 35:20.743
Wow, you're really out of breath.
I'm sorry, did you fucking run here?

35:20.911 --> 35:22.703
- Yeah.
- From your house?

35:22.871 --> 35:26.457
- L started running. lt's really fun.
- Okay, you're sopping in sweat.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.293
- Lsn't that like 12 miles?
- Thirteen-point-six.

35:29.461 --> 35:33.255
But it's good because it just, like,
really gets my endorphins up.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.591
It helps me clear my head.

35:36.301 --> 35:39.678
The Riley account is a handful.
I have been so swamped.

35:39.846 --> 35:43.265
Good. l'm glad you've been so busy.
Have you spoken to Jesse?

35:43.433 --> 35:47.394
I actually ran into him,
and l thought he was looking a little fat.

35:47.562 --> 35:51.190
Really? l feel like when l saw him,
he was looking kind of fit.

35:51.358 --> 35:54.985
- So you saw Jesse?
- Yeah. Yeah, l have. l've seen him.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.947
And you've hung out
with what's-her-name?

35:58.114 --> 35:59.490
Veronica? Yes, l have.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.869
- Can l get a rush delivery on that?
- She's dumb, right?

36:04.037 --> 36:07.540
No, she's not dumb. She's....
She's simple.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.167
Does 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
work as a window for you?

36:10.335 --> 36:11.794
Simple means dumb, though.

36:11.962 --> 36:15.548
No, actually.
Simple in a really elegant way.

36:15.715 --> 36:17.299
Elegant.

36:17.467 --> 36:20.594
- L think we're done here.
- Yeah, that window is fine.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.765
- L thought you would be happy for Jesse.
- Oh, no, l totally am.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.643
I just didn't realize
that Monica was elegant.

36:27.811 --> 36:32.273
You know her name's Veronica.
And honestly, honey, you'd really like her.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.150
Okay, don't do that.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.488
Are you having regrets about Jesse?

36:39.656 --> 36:42.658
What? No. Not one.

36:42.826 --> 36:45.744
Will you let me drive you home?
I'm afraid you'll drown.

36:45.912 --> 36:49.874
Okay. l actually have a date tonight.
I should probably shower, right?

36:50.041 --> 36:52.167
Yeah, l would. Yes, shower.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.795
- Who's the date?
- Rupert Bates.

36:54.963 --> 36:58.424
Rupert Bates. The Gap model?

36:58.592 --> 37:02.845
Oh, my God. He's so hot.
But he's like 1 1 years old.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.138
He's actually 22.

37:04.306 --> 37:06.807
Skillz set me up with him.
He's gonna be a star.

37:06.975 --> 37:10.769
He's filming 20,000 BC right now,
which is the prequel to 10,000 BC.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.938
- Oh, fuck, l love that movie.
- L know.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.441
A star fell from the sky

37:15.609 --> 37:17.401
Look at you and l realize

37:19.070 --> 37:22.615
It's the way your body moves

37:24.951 --> 37:27.119
First time that l saw your face

37:27.287 --> 37:30.706
You're like a little alien from outer space

37:31.333 --> 37:35.502
l'm gonna follow you to the moon

37:37.881 --> 37:40.049
That was so good.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.426
- L wrote it for my mom.
- Lucky lady.

37:42.594 --> 37:46.096
Why do you wanna follow your mom
to the moon?

37:46.264 --> 37:49.266
- She's the best. You'd love her.
- Yeah. l bet.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.436
So how do you know Skillz?

37:52.604 --> 37:55.606
Skillz provides me
with the happy smoky green treats.

37:56.316 --> 38:00.778
- Awesome.
- L'm sorry, but you are just....

38:01.655 --> 38:04.281
Hello, special one.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.410
No.

38:09.579 --> 38:14.625
This is crazy, but l just totally forgot
l left a candle burning at my house.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.293
- L have to go.
- No, of course.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.629
I'm so sorry.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.548
L'll send you a copy of the song
when it's done.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.396
My hair is so dry. lt looks like straw.

38:35.563 --> 38:39.483
- Here, do you want an Adderall?
- No, that shit makes me feel like a robot.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.027
Speaking of robot,
who designed this place?

38:42.195 --> 38:44.863
I feel like Spock
is about to walk around the corner.

38:45.031 --> 38:48.200
Hi, Riley. l'm Celeste.
I'm a partner at Pop Form.

38:48.368 --> 38:51.120
I just wanted to introduce myself.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.914
You're kind of pretty.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.042
Thank you.
I'm just gonna sneak in here.

38:57.210 --> 39:01.547
- Why am l breaking out?
- Too much sugar, coffee, alcohol.

39:02.465 --> 39:05.217
I think it's my new skin regime. Yeah.

39:05.385 --> 39:08.220
It's "regimen."

39:08.388 --> 39:10.014
What?

39:10.181 --> 39:15.269
A regime is a system of government.
The word is... The word's "regimen."

39:16.938 --> 39:20.399
Thanks, Scrabble.
It was really nice to meet you.

39:20.567 --> 39:24.611
In thinking about your brand, we wanted
a sense of where you currently exist.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.739
We set up a number of focus groups.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.201
You test really high in the Midwest,
which is wonderful.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.121
We'll be rolling those out
to a few different cities.

39:34.289 --> 39:38.959
Celeste has come up with a number of
ideas for logos, which are looking great.

39:39.753 --> 39:43.088
- Celeste, you wanna...?
- Yes. Yes. Here.

39:43.256 --> 39:45.340
Our first round is based heavily...

39:45.508 --> 39:50.304
on a kind of hip-hop,
retro, throwback, industrial flair.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.973
The one l was talking
to my girl Savannah about.

39:53.141 --> 39:56.727
Really trying to get the urban flavor
in there for the tweens.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.812
Do you guys have any snacks?

40:00.315 --> 40:01.648
Like sushi?

40:07.238 --> 40:08.906
Hello, special one.

40:10.200 --> 40:13.243
- Sounds so awful.
- Lt was so awful.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.705
I mean, where are the guys
who don't wear makeup for a living?

40:16.873 --> 40:20.000
How about a little intellect?
Intellect never hurt anybody.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.920
- Wait. You never met Nick, right?
- Nick?

40:23.088 --> 40:24.880
- Nick Moran.
- The photographer?

40:25.048 --> 40:27.883
- No. You know him?
- Yeah, we went to school together.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.345
This could be perfect.

40:31.513 --> 40:36.517
I'm uncomfortable with dating,
and l don't really like any of it.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.936
Trust me, you will like him.

40:39.104 --> 40:43.273
And also, l love cock.

40:45.235 --> 40:48.570
You gotta work a little harder
to integrate the gayness, Scott.

40:48.738 --> 40:49.988
Yeah.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.824
- Good night.
- Night.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.867
- L'll hook that up tomorrow.
- Great.

40:56.871 --> 40:59.832
Nailed it. Way to go, Becky.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.167
- Go, team, right?
- Yeah!

41:03.044 --> 41:07.881
- What the fuck is a BabyBjÃ¶rn?
- Lt's a very, very tiny Swedish man.

41:08.049 --> 41:11.385
A child carrier that allows the baby
to benefit from intimacy...

41:11.553 --> 41:13.720
without the confinement of a stroller.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.681
- How do you know that?
- Beth.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.100
Yeah, we go to a lot of baby showers.

41:18.268 --> 41:20.185
I put a lot of babies in the ladies.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.979
- How's Celeste?
- Who?

41:22.147 --> 41:23.522
- Celeste.
- She's all right.

41:23.690 --> 41:27.860
I'm kind of fine-tuning her cannabis levels
right now, but she's okay.

41:28.027 --> 41:31.238
- She doesn't smoke weed.
- She does now. She loves that shit.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.699
Fucking Snoop Dogg.

41:34.617 --> 41:39.872
Birthing towel, breast pump,
Diaper Genie? Fuck.

41:40.039 --> 41:44.668
- L'm seriously having a baby.
- You'll do great, man.

41:44.836 --> 41:48.172
Hey, Skillz. Who's your buddy?

41:49.883 --> 41:51.508
I thought he was your friend.

41:51.676 --> 41:52.801
- Not with me.
- Really?

41:52.969 --> 41:54.178
I don't know him.

41:57.765 --> 42:01.560
I waited like 21 hours,
three of them soaked in my own pee.

42:01.728 --> 42:05.314
- Oh, my God.
- But l finally got the shot of Gaddafi.

42:05.481 --> 42:07.316
My God, l've totally seen this one.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.026
- You've seen it?
- Yeah.

42:09.194 --> 42:13.238
- L'm such a big fan. That's so cool.
- Thank you.

42:13.406 --> 42:15.991
- L feel like he's kind of smiling.
- He is.

42:16.159 --> 42:21.413
I mean, l think the piss stain
running down my jeans made him laugh.

42:21.581 --> 42:22.831
Seriously, l was soaked.

42:22.999 --> 42:27.044
The world will think you're brilliant.
L'll be the only one who knows.

42:27.212 --> 42:28.462
What?

42:28.630 --> 42:31.048
- We missed our reservation for 8:30.
- Oh, no.

42:31.216 --> 42:34.134
You want me to call down,
see if they can still take us?

42:34.302 --> 42:35.928
Should l just, like...?

42:36.095 --> 42:38.764
You guys still take us for like 9, 9:1 5?

42:38.932 --> 42:41.934
- L don't think anybody...
- Ls that cool?

42:42.101 --> 42:43.769
- You can't do that?
- You can.

42:43.937 --> 42:46.104
I just don't think anybody will hear you.

42:46.272 --> 42:49.733
You know what?
I actually would be cool...

42:49.901 --> 42:51.652
Let's just get room service.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.403
- Room service?
- Yeah.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.155
Okay. l could do room service.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.532
- Cool.
- That sounds good. l like that.

42:57.700 --> 43:01.620
I'm so happy this worked out.
It's so nice to meet you.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.757
Can't remember the last time
l felt like this.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.927
Yes.

43:26.813 --> 43:29.648
- What are you doing?
- What do you think l'm doing?

43:30.441 --> 43:34.903
No, no, no. Don't do that.
Things were going so well.

43:35.071 --> 43:37.447
- L want you to watch me.
- There's no watching.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.575
- L'm almost there.
- Where? Don't. No. l can't...

43:40.743 --> 43:42.744
Almost there.

43:42.912 --> 43:45.831
Yeah, come on. That's it.

43:45.999 --> 43:49.543
- Move.
- Yeah, it's coming.

43:50.545 --> 43:53.255
Here it comes. Here it comes.

44:04.851 --> 44:06.768
Hey. So l'm glad we can meet up.

44:06.936 --> 44:11.273
There's this place by me, Vegan Vittles
on Elysian Way. Call me if you get lost.

44:12.275 --> 44:14.818
What the fuck is a vegan vittle?

44:19.782 --> 44:21.658
Just tell her to be here tomorrow.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.076
- Hey.
- Sorry, one second.

44:23.244 --> 44:25.787
Just have to send this e-mail.

44:26.664 --> 44:27.914
There. Hi.

44:28.082 --> 44:30.334
- Hi. What's up?
- A lot.

44:30.877 --> 44:34.880
- Can l get some coffee, please?
- We have yerba matÃ©.

44:35.048 --> 44:37.174
- Green tea?
- We have decaf green tea.

44:37.342 --> 44:40.093
- L'll just get some water.
- Okay. Anything for you?

44:40.261 --> 44:42.471
- L'd like the veganchilada, please.
- Sure.

44:42.638 --> 44:45.223
- Cashew-cheese sauce on the side.
- Yeah.

44:45.391 --> 44:47.726
L'd like to take a look
at your seaweed menu.

44:47.894 --> 44:50.312
Yeah. There you go.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.065
- No, l'm good, thanks.
- Awesome. Baltic kelp.

44:53.232 --> 44:55.484
- Yep.
- L'll have that. Thank you.

44:58.738 --> 45:01.281
- You look good.
- Thanks. You look good too.

45:02.075 --> 45:03.825
L've been doing a lot of Pilates.

45:03.993 --> 45:06.161
- Really?
- Yeah. Veronica's a dancer.

45:06.329 --> 45:11.583
She has all this equipment at her house,
so l've just been getting into it.

45:13.711 --> 45:17.464
Well, l know all this
has been really weird.

45:17.632 --> 45:20.092
It's only weird if you think it's weird.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.386
Okay.

45:22.553 --> 45:26.973
There's apparently a holdup
on the divorce papers on your end...

45:27.892 --> 45:30.602
and Veronica's actually
not a citizen, so...

45:30.770 --> 45:34.231
- What? Where's she from?
- Belgium.

45:34.399 --> 45:35.649
Belgium. Elegant.

45:35.817 --> 45:37.401
- What?
- Nothing.

45:37.568 --> 45:40.570
Point is, we need to get married...

45:40.738 --> 45:45.200
and l'm really sorry to bug you, but l
really need you to sign those papers.

45:48.371 --> 45:49.413
Okay, Jesse.

45:49.580 --> 45:53.708
Well, l've been busy with work,
because some of us work for a living...

45:53.876 --> 45:58.463
so l'm sorry l haven't had time to focus
on helping you get on with your new life.

45:58.631 --> 46:00.132
I know. l'm sorry.

46:01.426 --> 46:05.387
What makes you think you're suitable
to be a dad, even?

46:05.596 --> 46:09.015
- We never talked about kids.
- You had reservations about kids.

46:09.183 --> 46:12.310
- L had reservations about kids with you.
- Yeah, well, ditto.

46:12.478 --> 46:15.105
I think Veronica's
gonna be an amazing mother.

46:15.857 --> 46:17.732
Low blow.

46:19.235 --> 46:20.861
L'll sign the papers.

46:21.028 --> 46:23.321
You're ridiculous.
This place is ridiculous.

46:23.489 --> 46:26.199
Fucking cashew-vegan-kelp bullshit.

46:30.204 --> 46:32.414
Jesse's a fucking vegan?

46:32.582 --> 46:34.624
Yeah, a vegan whose work
is being shown.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.710
- At the Gagosian.
- At the Gagos...?

46:36.878 --> 46:37.919
- What?
- Yep.

46:38.087 --> 46:40.297
How does anybody even know
about his art...?

46:40.465 --> 46:42.883
Know what?
I don't wanna know anything.

46:43.050 --> 46:45.177
My God, he's on fire right now.

46:45.344 --> 46:48.013
Breaking up with me
was the best thing he ever did.

46:48.181 --> 46:50.140
- L should break up with me.
- Oh, stop.

46:50.308 --> 46:52.893
Somebody else's success
does not mean your demise.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.352
Except for Jesse's.

46:54.520 --> 46:57.230
- What are you guys dressed as again?
- Bieber.

46:57.398 --> 47:00.025
- He just got a buzz cut.
- What? Fuck!

47:00.193 --> 47:01.443
- Shut up.
- When?

47:01.611 --> 47:03.528
Like two hours ago. lt was on Perez.

47:03.696 --> 47:05.655
- Goddamn it.
- His hair was everything.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.365
He's really talented.

47:07.575 --> 47:11.786
What's with the costume parties
in the middle of the summer? Hot.

47:16.250 --> 47:17.501
I need to fucking drink.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.212
- Car bombs in the fucking kitchen.
- Yes.

47:20.379 --> 47:22.339
- No.
- Yes, l'm doing that. Yes.

47:22.507 --> 47:25.050
You wanna wait a little bit?

47:25.218 --> 47:27.761
- L say "car," you say "bomb." Car!
- Bomb!

47:27.929 --> 47:29.554
Three, two, one, drink!

47:29.764 --> 47:31.765
- Three, two, one. She lost.
- Come on.

47:31.933 --> 47:33.767
- She lost.
- That's pretty good for...

47:33.935 --> 47:36.478
No, don't be nice. Hey.

47:36.646 --> 47:39.064
What even are you supposed to be?

47:39.232 --> 47:41.691
- Yeah.
- What? Oh, white trash.

47:41.859 --> 47:43.693
- What is that?
- White trash.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.987
- White "shrash"? Shrash?
- White trash.

47:46.155 --> 47:47.614
It's white trash.

47:47.782 --> 47:50.825
- Celeste.
- Yoga.

47:50.993 --> 47:54.955
- L haven't seen you there in a while.
- L know. l've been running a lot.

47:55.122 --> 47:59.584
- Lt really helps you keep in better shape.
- L can see that's important to you.

48:01.754 --> 48:03.838
How's your practice?

48:04.006 --> 48:06.424
That's funny. White trash?

48:08.135 --> 48:11.137
- What are you?
- L'm a cereal killer, obviously.

48:12.682 --> 48:14.266
Hey, you were right.

48:14.433 --> 48:17.102
- What do you mean?
- You were right about me.

48:17.270 --> 48:20.313
The car, the phone...

48:20.481 --> 48:21.523
the yoga.

48:21.691 --> 48:24.693
Except l went to an lvy League school.
I went to Cornell.

48:24.860 --> 48:27.279
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

48:27.446 --> 48:29.072
- That's barely an lvy.
- L know.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.199
Barely.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.994
- Do you smoke?
- At parties.

48:34.161 --> 48:35.370
Let's go. Me too.

48:37.999 --> 48:42.961
I'm sorry for that day at the studio.
I just feel really open after yoga.

48:43.462 --> 48:46.089
Don't say "open." No.

48:46.257 --> 48:48.717
Your costume is so great.
You're gonna ruin it.

48:48.884 --> 48:51.511
I'm kidding.
You know why l go to yoga?

48:51.679 --> 48:54.431
I go to yoga to meet girls.

48:55.016 --> 48:56.266
- L believe that.
- You do?

48:56.434 --> 48:57.809
Yeah.

49:00.396 --> 49:03.857
Speaking of, what's the deal
with you and me? l mean, are we...?

49:04.609 --> 49:08.737
Is it happening or what?

49:08.904 --> 49:10.655
Well, the deal with you and me...

49:10.823 --> 49:13.825
is that my husband of six years
wants a divorce...

49:13.993 --> 49:18.580
because he wants to marry the woman
who's carrying his child.

49:18.748 --> 49:21.416
That's the deal with you and me.

49:21.751 --> 49:23.418
Sounds tough.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.754
He barely knows her.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.798
He's just lost...

49:28.966 --> 49:34.721
and he's just going about everything
so wrong.

49:35.473 --> 49:37.349
And you're right.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.934
Now what?

49:41.979 --> 49:43.855
What does that mean?

49:44.023 --> 49:46.941
I mean, do you wanna be right,
or do you wanna be happy?

49:47.109 --> 49:51.279
Okay, listen, Yoga, l don't wanna be right.
I know l'm right, okay?

49:51.447 --> 49:55.617
People will let you down.
I have accepted that fact.

49:55.785 --> 49:58.244
But knowing that...

49:58.412 --> 50:02.123
makes it impossible to be happy.

50:02.291 --> 50:03.958
But at least it's fucking real.

50:05.711 --> 50:08.630
No one has ever given
a more self-righteous monologue...

50:08.798 --> 50:11.341
- wearing a trash bag.
- Shut up.

50:12.593 --> 50:14.219
Okay, drunkie, let's go home.

50:14.387 --> 50:15.720
- Paul.
- Justin Bieber.

50:15.888 --> 50:17.138
Justin Bieber. Hi.

50:17.306 --> 50:18.431
- Justin Bieber too.
- Hi.

50:18.599 --> 50:19.683
Just kidding. Beth.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.351
- You want another drink?
- Two.

50:21.519 --> 50:23.269
- One drink.
- One drink.

51:01.684 --> 51:05.103
Hey, you've reached Jesse.
Leave me a message.

51:05.271 --> 51:10.316
Hey, l still have a bunch of your shit.
I'm just gonna drop it off. Okay.

51:39.346 --> 51:42.056
You're gonna be a really good dad.

51:42.224 --> 51:44.476
What made you say that?

51:45.436 --> 51:49.063
I don't know. l just know it.

51:56.655 --> 52:02.160
Well, that's an extravagant purchase for
a freelance artist and his Belgian bride.

52:10.085 --> 52:11.753
Shit.

52:11.921 --> 52:14.005
Shit, shit, shit.

52:17.218 --> 52:20.470
I just realized
l don't know your middle name.

52:21.555 --> 52:25.391
- Lt's Godelieve.
- Goldleaf?

52:25.559 --> 52:29.938
No, Godelieve.
It means "loved by the gods."

52:30.105 --> 52:31.898
lt's Dutch.

52:33.859 --> 52:35.985
- Pretty.
- Thanks.

52:36.153 --> 52:39.239
- What's yours?
- Mordechai.

52:39.949 --> 52:42.408
Okay. What does it mean?

52:42.576 --> 52:46.162
It means l'm very, very Jewish.

52:46.664 --> 52:48.289
Right.

52:59.301 --> 53:01.219
Celeste?

53:03.389 --> 53:05.181
Hey.

53:05.391 --> 53:07.851
Hey. What are you doing here?

53:09.353 --> 53:12.063
I just was dropping off
some of your stuff.

53:12.231 --> 53:14.440
Why were you in the trash can?

53:14.608 --> 53:15.817
I lost something.

53:15.985 --> 53:17.110
- Ln the trash?
- Yeah.

53:17.278 --> 53:20.488
It was my bracelet, but l got it back.
So it's... l'm fine.

53:22.199 --> 53:23.616
Oh, you remember Veronica.

53:23.784 --> 53:27.120
Yes. Hi. Wow, you're so pregnant.
Oh, my God.

53:27.288 --> 53:29.414
- Yeah.
- L love your sweater.

53:29.582 --> 53:31.374
- Oh, thank you.
- Good compliment.

53:31.542 --> 53:34.210
I'm gonna go,
because l'm late for something, so...

53:34.378 --> 53:36.462
Sure you don't wanna come in for tea?

53:36.630 --> 53:40.300
No, no, you guys have a good afternight.
I'm gonna...

53:40.467 --> 53:41.593
Is that mine?

53:42.803 --> 53:45.388
What? Yeah, l don't know how l got...

53:45.556 --> 53:48.892
- L'm so glad we did this. Bye, you guys.
- Okay.

53:51.854 --> 53:55.481
Step out of the shadows, girl,
and into the light.

53:55.649 --> 53:59.152
Chips are gonna fall, you know?
No need to trip.

53:59.320 --> 54:02.238
- What are they like together?
- Who?

54:03.449 --> 54:05.450
- Oh, Jesse and Veronica?
- Yeah.

54:06.201 --> 54:08.328
They're okay, you know?

54:08.495 --> 54:12.832
He's trying, but it's not all rainbows
and unicorns over there, you know?

54:13.000 --> 54:15.376
- So they're not happy?
- No, l didn't say that.

54:15.961 --> 54:17.795
Listen, he's my friend, you know...

54:17.963 --> 54:21.507
and l love him,
but you're my friend too, you know?

54:21.675 --> 54:25.887
And if you ever need, like,
any kind of special friendship...

54:26.055 --> 54:29.349
you know, like, just someone
to be with you and hold you...

54:29.516 --> 54:34.062
and caress you and be good to you
in ways that maybe guys aren't...

54:34.980 --> 54:36.648
l think l could be that guy.

54:36.815 --> 54:39.525
- No.
- Good. Good, good.

54:40.736 --> 54:42.862
So where do you live?

54:43.030 --> 54:45.239
I'm in Westwood, in a condo.

54:45.407 --> 54:47.825
- Cool.
- You're gonna love this place.

54:47.993 --> 54:50.453
Never been so relaxed in your life.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.330
There you go.

54:52.498 --> 54:54.999
This is a very unique place
to take a date.

54:55.167 --> 54:56.876
Yeah, l take all my dates here.

54:57.044 --> 54:59.462
- Oh, l feel so special.
- You are.

54:59.630 --> 55:00.672
Right, Nana?

55:00.839 --> 55:02.840
They all are.

55:03.008 --> 55:05.009
How's being right going for you?

55:05.177 --> 55:09.430
Oh, you know, not that well, really.

55:09.598 --> 55:12.767
I was on a real winning streak.
That's why l called you.

55:12.935 --> 55:15.061
You know what? l'm happy you did.

55:15.229 --> 55:18.982
Why would you take me to a place
where Asian people beat you up?

55:19.149 --> 55:23.444
- But how do you feel?
- L feel.... l feel really good, actually.

55:23.612 --> 55:25.780
So shut up, then.

55:25.948 --> 55:28.950
- What are we doing now?
- Don't try to control everything.

55:29.118 --> 55:32.453
You need to let go.
In yoga, we call it vairagya.

55:32.621 --> 55:34.914
Don't with the yoga.

55:35.082 --> 55:36.124
- Yo.
- What's up.

55:36.291 --> 55:37.959
- What's going on?
- How you doing?

55:38.127 --> 55:41.337
- Hey, this is Celeste.
- Celeste, what's up? Matt.

55:42.089 --> 55:45.466
Is Louis here? Yeah? Good crowd?

55:45.634 --> 55:49.429
Good crowd? Like your grandma?
Where are we?

55:49.596 --> 55:51.264
What is this?

55:51.432 --> 55:53.808
This is her first time here.

55:53.976 --> 55:55.601
Check it out.

56:00.107 --> 56:02.275
Oh, my God.

56:06.030 --> 56:09.365
- This place is really cool.
- You sound surprised.

56:09.533 --> 56:12.326
I am surprised. You live in Westwood.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.374
- What do you want to drink?
- Beer?

56:18.542 --> 56:19.876
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

56:21.545 --> 56:23.546
How you doing, man?

56:23.714 --> 56:26.674
Hi, sweetheart. Can l get two beers?

56:28.427 --> 56:31.012
Don't burn yourself. Jesus.

56:31.889 --> 56:33.806
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

56:33.974 --> 56:36.184
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

56:38.520 --> 56:41.272
This is quite a spot.

56:44.443 --> 56:46.611
Oh, no.

56:48.363 --> 56:51.574
- You like to dance?
- Yeah. Guess you do too.

56:51.742 --> 56:54.285
- You're good.
- Oh, you're good.

57:15.140 --> 57:16.307
What was that for?

57:16.475 --> 57:20.770
Vairagya, bro.
Don't try to control everything.

57:31.490 --> 57:34.909
- L really like the logo.
- Oh, good. Yeah, l think it's perfect.

57:35.077 --> 57:37.578
Yeah, the Keith Haring influence
is pretty cool.

57:37.746 --> 57:40.081
Yeah, there is a little bit
of that going on.

57:40.249 --> 57:42.542
- Are you mocking me?
- No, l just...

57:42.709 --> 57:45.503
I'm impressed that you know about art.

57:45.671 --> 57:48.673
Why? Because l'm a pop star
or because l was homeschooled?

57:48.841 --> 57:51.634
Whatever.
Do you know what your problem is?

57:51.802 --> 57:55.805
- Contempt prior to investigation.
- L'm sorry?

57:55.973 --> 58:01.102
You think you're smarter than everybody,
and that is your dark little prison.

58:01.270 --> 58:02.436
Nice shoes.

58:05.941 --> 58:08.317
Dark little prison?

58:09.153 --> 58:11.320
You don't know my life.
You don't know me.

58:11.488 --> 58:15.616
You know what's a dark little prison
is having to wear midriffs for a living.

58:15.784 --> 58:18.411
That's a dark little prison.
Give me a break.

58:18.579 --> 58:20.538
That's what l'm talking about.

58:22.749 --> 58:24.625
What the fuck?

58:34.344 --> 58:37.305
- L started smoking again.
- Yeah, l can see that.

58:40.893 --> 58:44.812
I don't know what the rules are,
and l'm sure l'm breaking them...

58:44.980 --> 58:48.441
but l really miss you.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.740
Do you wanna come in?

58:55.908 --> 58:59.952
Veronica's actually pretty good friends
with the assistant gallerist there...

59:00.120 --> 59:02.371
and he really liked my stuff, so....

59:02.539 --> 59:06.125
- l don't know, we'll see.
- Jess, that's so great.

59:06.293 --> 59:09.295
- L'm so happy for you.
- Yeah.

59:09.463 --> 59:12.840
Yeah, it's great.

59:21.308 --> 59:23.935
- L should probably get home.
- Yeah.

59:24.811 --> 59:27.021
It's really nice to see you.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:10.022
You should go.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.406
Can't we just lie here a little bit?

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:47.143
Can't believe l'm having a baby
and it's not with you.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:06.996
Yeah?

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:09.915
Hey, we have a massive problem
on our hands.

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.461
I don't... l don't see anything.

01:01:16.465 --> 01:01:18.883
It's a penis and a butt.

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:22.595
Really? No, l don't... l don't see it.

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:26.724
There's a penis,
and there's the penis going into the butt.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.772
Oh, my God.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:37.902
Oh, my God, it's a cock...
It's a cock... lt's a cock in a butt.

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:40.112
Oh, my Go...

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.449
Oh, my God. That's really bad.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.159
This isn't a joke, Celeste.

01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:48.371
There's homosexual butt sex
in the logo.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:52.875
Does Riley think we're stupid?
I mean, who are these sick people?

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.920
Neither Riley nor a representative
from Pop Form...

01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:59.131
the marketing company responsible,
could be reached...

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.287
There you go.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.957
- Let me know if you need anything else.
- Thanks.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:44.218
Thanks for meeting me here.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:46.137
I don't know what l'm wearing.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:49.557
- You kind of look like a crazy cat lady.
- Yeah.

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:53.686
I just can't buy anything nice,
because they'll just ruin it, you know?

01:02:56.606 --> 01:03:00.109
- Look, Celeste...
- No, let me just say something, okay?

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:03.362
I don't know what's going on
in your other situation...

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:07.491
but for the record, l fucked up.

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:12.288
I was cavalier with you,
and l took us for granted.

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:17.084
And l know this sounds crazy,
but l would be remiss if l didn't just...

01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:22.006
If you were open to it,
l feel like l could do better...

01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:25.217
with you, with us.

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:29.472
And if there is still a chance,
l'd love to know.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.939
Jesse.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:41.275
I'm sorry.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:43.986
I can't.

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.538
Hey.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.959
Hey. Why'd you come over last night?

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:02.254
- L don't know.
- No, l think you do know.

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:06.300
- Lt was a mistake. l shouldn't have come.
- You fucking coward.

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.177
I'm having a baby.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:11.347
I need to figure out a way
to make it work with Veronica.

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:14.642
- L'm trying to change.
- Why didn't you change for me?

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:17.353
I don't think you really wanted me to.

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:21.774
All l did was wait for you to grow up.

01:04:21.942 --> 01:04:24.610
I rooted for you.
I fucking paid for everything.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:27.947
- L did everything for you.
- Yeah, and l was never your equal.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.907
I think you preferred it that way.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:33.786
Wait. Wait. l know that my success
was never okay for you.

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:38.415
- What do you want?
- L want you to admit that you're wrong.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:39.917
Wrong about what?

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:43.462
What did you expect me to do,
wait for you to meet someone first?

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.589
Is that how you saw it happening?

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:48.759
Look, l didn't expect to meet someone
so fast, but l did.

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:52.096
I have a real chance of being happy.
I don't wanna blow that.

01:04:52.264 --> 01:04:56.392
Well, you know what, Jesse?
You definitely will blow it.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.855
You know, l feel sorry for you.

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:05.150
You might actually be alone
your whole life.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:10.030
- Don't ever call me.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:28.507
No, no, no.

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:29.842
No, no.

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:32.970
Okay.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:37.766
Thank you.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.816
- He's so sad.
- Totally.

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:47.860
Wait.

01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:52.448
No. He's painting little rabbits.
He's so happy.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:56.452
He's so sad. l know. l went to art camp.

01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:00.456
Oh, word?

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.000
Fuck.

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:05.085
All right.

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:09.131
If that's how it's going down,
that's how it's going down right now.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.509
Hit it. Go get it.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:21.644
That's the best thing
that's happened to me in months.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.854
Shit will get better.

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:26.065
Will it? You don't know that.

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:33.238
- L can't believe he did this to me.
- Who? J?

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:36.700
He didn't do nothing.
You wanted a divorce.

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:38.869
Yeah, but l didn't want it like this.

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:42.498
When we're no longer able
to change a situation...

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.542
we're challenged
to change ourselves.

01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:48.420
Viktor Frankl.

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:51.590
Or Biggie Smalls.
It might be Biggie Smalls.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:54.218
I don't know. l don't remember.

01:06:54.386 --> 01:06:56.887
Fuck, man. l am fucking high.
Are you high?

01:06:57.305 --> 01:07:00.265
I'm so high. All right, l gotta go.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.142
- Can l come?
- No.

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:04.561
- Can you get me some Del Taco?
- No.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:07.189
Do you think the Obamas
really love each other?

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.733
Yeah. Yeah, l really do.

01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:12.277
No more questions.

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:16.615
Take it easy on that shit.
It is not for kids.

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:42.599
Hey.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:44.643
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:47.521
- You remember Eileen.
- You have more ranch dressing?

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:49.857
- Lt's the fucking bomb.
- Did you finish...?

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:51.942
Beth is getting married.

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:56.029
I was married once. You remember?
These guys are in for a fucking dogfight.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.157
- Let's go get you a soda.
- A dogfight.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:07:59.533
You're a dogfight.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:01.744
I don't wanna be alone forever.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:05.080
Oh, honey.
You're not gonna be alone forever.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.708
You're just in a time-out
till you sober up.

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:10.753
I'm gonna sit here.
I'm not gonna embarrass you, okay?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.129
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:30.147
We should get Nick Nolte
out of here, huh?

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.194
Hey, Riley. l am calling to talk to you...

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:39.656
about the error in your logo.

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:41.658
I'm so, so sorry.

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:45.996
And l just wanna let you know
that l am on top of it.

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:48.165
Please call me back. Thank you.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:52.419
Do you feel like the dress l'm wearing
reads more like eggshell or rose petal?

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:56.089
Rose petal's okay. Eggshell is too whitish
to do two days in a row.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:58.425
- You look great.
- Honey, l need your help.

01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:01.011
I have like an hour, and you owe me...

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:03.221
because you humped
my nana yesterday.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:05.182
The fuck does Riley Banks know?

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.060
Nothing. She's a tart.

01:09:08.228 --> 01:09:11.104
Yes, she's a tart.
She's got a cute little hot bod.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.149
- She's moderately talented.
- Not even.

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:17.444
- Five years and it's a wrap on that face.
- Lf. Three, four.

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:19.947
Why is she telling me anything
about my life?

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:21.782
She's a stupid litt...

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:28.580
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What?

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:31.416
I never hung up.
I didn't hang up the call.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.381
Crap.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.011
You gotta get it.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.557
Hey, Riley, what's up?

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:51.270
Hi.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:54.523
Listen, l... This is a really nice place.

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:57.943
The thing is, l've been having a hard time
in my own life.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:01.488
So when you said that thing
about contempt and investigation...

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:04.700
Can you just shut up for a minute?

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:10.581
I just found out
that my boyfriend cheated on me.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.713
Oh, God, l'm so sorry.
I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.090
Yeah, exactly. Nobody knew.

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:24.344
He didn't want anyone to know, because
it would be bad for his image and....

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:26.305
He's just such a fucking asshole.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:30.726
Now my career might be over because
you decided to put a penis in my logo.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:36.523
- Thank you for that.
- L know. l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:40.694
Come here.

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:44.156
- Why?
- Come here. Just come here. lt's okay.

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:45.991
It's okay. lt's okay.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:51.204
I'm just so sad. And tired.

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:53.790
And now l'm gonna be alone like you.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:57.669
Okay, you don't know
what you're saying right now. lt's okay.

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:19.024
Are you crying about sports?

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:23.320
Just reminds me of someone.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.322
Is this about a girl?

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:30.744
- L'm not gay.
- No, l know. l meant a boy.

01:11:32.664 --> 01:11:33.705
Yeah.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:36.792
Do you miss him?

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:39.461
Yeah, l do.

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:42.255
They all fucking suck.

01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:45.133
Kind of.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:50.222
It really never gets better?
Like, not even when you're old?

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.393
No.

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:59.106
But you do.

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:05.237
- Can we hug again?
- Yeah.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:11.827
I won't, no. Crap.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:14.871
No, no, no. l'm at the airport.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:16.957
Beth, l'm sitting at the gate.

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:18.834
Of course l have my dress.

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:25.173
Hi, sir. l'm so sorry to bother you,
but is there any way l could cut in line?

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:28.885
I'm the maid of honor at this wedding.
Hi. l'm sorry to bother you.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:33.223
Maybe you heard me talking to the last
gentleman, but l need to get my dress.

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:54.304
She pursued her love
Of Spanish men

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:57.808
But missed her Tucker
More than just a friend

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.854
Our princess returned home
To her loving prince

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:06.191
And they've been together
Ever since

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:08.610
We love you, Bethy.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.658
Now we're gonna turn it over
to Celeste...

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:18.120
Beth's best friend in the world.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.799
That... Thanks, girls.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:35.345
That was....
There are no words for what that was.

01:14:37.849 --> 01:14:40.517
How do you get a nun pregnant?
You fuck her.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:46.022
Thank you, Reverend.
Appreciate it a lot.

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:50.902
It is not easy to get to Rhode lsland
from Los Angeles.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:57.534
There was a cab to a plane
to a cab to a train to a rental car.

01:14:57.702 --> 01:15:01.163
There was maybe a rickshaw
in there somewhere.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.831
Maybe a donkey.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:05.750
But the truth is...

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:10.297
l would go anywhere for Beth...

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:14.176
because she's my best friend
and l love her so much...

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.511
and l'm so happy for her.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:20.682
When we were in college,
senior year we had this tradition.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:24.519
Beth and Tucker
and me and Jesse would meet...

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:28.190
come rain or shine,
every Sunday at the Bishop.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.693
And there was always something there
with these two...

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.987
even though they were just friends.

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:39.201
Just, like, an ease that they had
with each other.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:42.329
They are perfect.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:46.750
At last, love wins.

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:56.718
Beth and Tucker...

01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:01.223
you guys are lucky,
so lucky to be best friends.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.226
Work hard at that.

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:07.187
And respect that.

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:13.026
Be patient.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:16.321
And...

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.950
you don't always have to be right.

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:24.579
Even if you are...

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.749
doesn't fucking matter anyway.

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:32.671
Fight for it every day.

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:36.424
I wish l had.

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:39.010
Cheers.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:11.418
This might not be the best time
to talk about it...

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:15.714
but at some point we're gonna
have to address Tucker's dance moves.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:25.765
He's so special.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:29.644
So your speech was...

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.563
beautiful?

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:36.776
Thank you.

01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:39.612
I meant it.

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:43.074
I know.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:49.247
You know what else is beautiful?

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:53.460
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:55.628
- Do we dare?
- We do.

01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:58.214
- Here, in front of everyone?
- Of course.

01:17:58.382 --> 01:18:00.508
- All right, maybe just once.
- Oh, my God.

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:03.261
- Talk to me. Oh, yeah.
- Oh, God.

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:05.347
Pointy tip, thick stem.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:07.515
- You're a bad boy.
- You're a grower.

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:10.268
You have graduated
and moved on to an adult life.

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:12.354
- Oh, God. Oh, no.
- Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:15.148
- L'm a baby corn. l'm not a big corn.
- Oh, my God.

01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:17.359
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:21.154
Oh, dude, it's so rotten.

01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:22.989
Hey.

01:18:23.157 --> 01:18:25.909
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing?

01:18:26.077 --> 01:18:29.204
- Oh, nothing. Just....
- lt's this thing that Jesse and l do.

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:33.708
We take this thing that resembles,
like, a tiny little penis...

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:36.127
and then we, like:

01:18:38.756 --> 01:18:41.674
- l don't really get it.
- Lt's stupid.

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:44.427
- Lt's stupid.
- They're about to serve dinner.

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:45.762
- Okay.
- Wanna sit down?

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.514
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:50.225
- See you on the dance floor, Celeste?
- Yeah.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:52.519
Do it, do it, do it.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:57.482
- L love you, baby.
- L love you, baby.

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:24.986
It sounds like the most
embarrassing speech ever.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:27.155
How are you gonna
show your face again?

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:31.451
Yeah, well, weirdly, l'm happy that
l did it. l feel better somehow.

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:33.369
This song is my bitch! Yeah!

01:20:36.207 --> 01:20:40.376
- The gays really know how to party, huh?
- What do you mean?

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:42.086
This is a gay club.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:45.131
It's opening night.
It doesn't know what it is yet.

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:49.385
- Riley, the club is called Swallow.
- L totally dated that guy.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:56.935
Excuse me. Could you tell your friend
Riley that we worship her?

01:20:57.102 --> 01:20:58.311
She's so pretty.

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:00.813
Sure. l'll tell her
when she's done dancing.

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:06.861
- You are aware that the logo is a...?
- A dick in a butt? Yeah.

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:12.951
All of our friends are, like, rocking it.
It's kind of become like gay lzod.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.578
It's amazing.

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:23.336
- Yo.
- The tweens don't want her anymore...

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.088
Scott, but the gays do.

01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:28.633
You're gay. Start thinking gay.
Ten percent of Americans are gay.

01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:30.593
Gay lzod. lt's great.

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.846
She could be Lady Gaga
by this time next year. Huge market.

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:37.559
You might have turned
the cock in the butt around.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.602
Cock in the butt is gonna be huge.

01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:43.648
Hi.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:48.194
Thirty-eight points for me,
plus 50 points for using all my tiles.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:50.863
- Wait, wait, wait. "Zooecia"?
- Yeah.

01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:53.866
No, that's not a word.
That's my hoochie cousin's name.

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:06.045
So l was at this club the other night,
and there was a tranny dressed like me.

01:22:06.213 --> 01:22:08.172
- Oh, my God, that's so sweet.
- L know.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.800
- That's a huge compliment.
- He was so hot too.

01:22:10.968 --> 01:22:13.428
- L mean, it was still me.
- That is so sweet.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.597
- Celeste.
- Rupert.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.348
You never called me back.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:20.476
You know, l think l lost my....

01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:25.106
- Do you know Riley? This is Rupert.
- Hi. l'm actually a big fan.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:26.316
Likewise.

01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:29.193
Get in there. Get in there.

01:22:35.326 --> 01:22:37.076
Very gentle.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:41.789
Help me out here.

01:23:08.359 --> 01:23:09.859
All right, both of us.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:12.028
I can't do it.

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.697
This. l'm sorry.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:21.663
What do you mean?
Are you serious? Why?

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.414
L....

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:27.168
l think l need to be alone.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:31.089
- L'm getting a divorce.
- L know you're getting divorced.

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:35.551
I know,
but l think l have to do that alone.

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:38.888
Yeah.

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:42.141
I respect that.

01:23:42.309 --> 01:23:45.311
You're not ready till you're ready.
Don't force it.

01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:48.523
That's some yoga shit.

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:52.318
But l like you.

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:58.491
So when you're ready,
if you're ready, you call me.

01:23:58.659 --> 01:23:59.701
Okay?

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:10.628
And sign here and here.

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:13.715
There? Yeah.

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.676
And initial here, sign here.

01:24:18.429 --> 01:24:19.554
And....

01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:24.809
- Here, sign, and here.
- L like that tie.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.729
Oh, thanks.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:31.816
Is it made out of organic mung beans?

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:37.238
No, actually,
l found it digging through your trash.

01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:53.337
Well, we're divorced.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:55.256
Yep.

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.133
We did it.

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:00.928
We nailed that divorce.

01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:05.266
What are you doing right now?

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.903
Cantonese voices. No respect
for when their mouths are actually open.

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:19.447
Oh, my God.
I don't think l could focus on it.

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:23.367
You couldn't.
It's not sexy, but it's damn funny.

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:27.747
It's beautiful.

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:31.250
I thought you hated it.

01:25:31.418 --> 01:25:33.628
Never seen it at night.

01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:44.847
Hey.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:50.144
I know we just got divorced,
but nobody died, right?

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:54.023
I don't know. lt's just....

01:25:55.692 --> 01:25:58.027
l was just thinking about how...

01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:01.280
you were right.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.910
I don't know what l'm doing.

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:21.592
Do you love her?

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.603
Then it's worth fighting for.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:41.028
Okay.

01:26:42.281 --> 01:26:44.574
Now l know why you fucking cry
all the time.

01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:47.910
- This shit's emotional.
- L've been trying to tell you.

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:56.127
You deserve to be happy.

01:26:57.296 --> 01:27:01.215
And l want that for you. Always.

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:04.343
Me too.

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:10.641
I love you.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.657
I love you too.

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:35.917
- Lt's late. l'm gonna walk you to your car.
- You probably should.

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:39.962
I should. l don't want you to get mugged
by someone from the philharmonic.

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:41.589
Good idea.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.219
Hey, you've reached Paul.
Leave a message.

01:27:47.387 --> 01:27:48.804
Hey.

01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:53.184
You're probably giving your card
to some girl in yoga right now...

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:55.895
but if that doesn't work out for you...

01:27:56.063 --> 01:27:59.148
l think l'm ready...

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:01.984
to beat you in Scrabble.

01:28:02.653 --> 01:28:04.195
Okay.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:14.288
Hi.

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:19.669
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:23.381
Never mind.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:27.635
I'm so sorry for cutting.

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:31.180
My dog's in the car and he's
really thirsty, so thanks.

01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:32.974
No problem.

01:28:33.725 --> 01:28:34.767
Hi.
