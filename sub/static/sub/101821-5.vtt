Jesus, can't a guy get

00:08.508 --> 00:11.052
five minutes of privacy
around here?

00:11.094 --> 00:12.262
What, you can't remember
what happened

00:12.303 --> 00:14.973
last week on  Shameless?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.307
That's actually
kind of pathetic.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.809
I feel sorry for you.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.144
Can you just get out of here?

00:19.185 --> 00:20.437
All right?
Go.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.981
Thank you.
Fucking pervert.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.900
Our community
has been infiltrated

00:25.942 --> 00:27.152
by undesirables.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.403
[Kev]
The Milkoviches.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.863
Terry's been banging
the lady who owns this place

00:29.904 --> 00:30.739
for a couple years.

00:30.780 --> 00:31.823
Mrs. McCurdy?

00:31.865 --> 00:32.991
She's, like, 90.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.284
[Lip]
Milton's coming by later.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.535
The place looks fantastic.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.287
How much did all this cost you?

00:37.328 --> 00:38.288
Six grand, maybe.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.497
-Why don't I split it with you?
-Yeah?

00:39.539 --> 00:41.124
You did the work.
Might as well.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.542
The South Side
doesn't really feel

00:42.584 --> 00:44.711
-like the South Side no more.
-[Jenkins]  I could use you.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.796
Democratic Party of Chicago
could use you.

00:46.838 --> 00:47.922
Someone with your passion,

00:47.964 --> 00:49.674
with your gift
for persuasive speech...

00:49.716 --> 00:50.592
you've got talent.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.511
We are cops.
We stop crime, period.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.263
And it is my job to train you.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.182
We bust heads.
We arrest people.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.558
That is our job.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.477
[over loudspeaker]
Fucking move your ass!

01:00.518 --> 01:02.103
I catch you selling
out here again,

01:02.145 --> 01:04.189
I'm busting your ass,
and I'm taking you in.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.482
Fuck the police!

-[Leesie] Strip.
-Leesie.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.027
[Leesie] No, she gonna learn.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.320
Come on, now.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.279
What if I offer you a job?

01:11.321 --> 01:12.447
I get to transport drugs

01:12.489 --> 01:13.865
and money legally.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.492
[Ian]  Weed might be legal,

01:15.533 --> 01:16.868
but carrying a gun
as a convicted felon

01:16.910 --> 01:18.411
is about as illegal as it gets.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.913
You think you're better
than me?

01:19.954 --> 01:20.663
Yes.

01:20.705 --> 01:21.790
The only thing
you're better than

01:21.831 --> 01:22.624
is the blacks.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.043
-[barking]
-Jesus. Easy, easy, easy.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.628
Even their dog is racist.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.464
We have to move
away from the racists.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.814

the luck you got

01:45.855 --> 01:49.275
Know that
it's not for naught

01:49.317 --> 01:52.320
You were beaming
once before

01:52.362 --> 01:56.991
But it's not like that
anymore

01:57.033 --> 02:00.286
What is this downside

02:00.328 --> 02:03.581
That you speak of?

02:03.623 --> 02:05.625
What is this feeling

02:05.667 --> 02:10.797
You're so sure of?

02:16.886 --> 02:20.640
Round up
the friends you got

02:20.682 --> 02:23.643
Know that
they're not for naught

02:23.685 --> 02:26.688
You were willing
once before

02:26.729 --> 02:31.442
But it's not like that
anymore

02:31.484 --> 02:34.571
What is this downside

02:34.612 --> 02:38.074
That you speak of?

02:38.116 --> 02:40.243
What is this feeling

02:40.285 --> 02:44.497
You're so sure of?

[sniffs]

[Tami] What's going on?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.823
-Yo!
-What's up?

04:00.865 --> 04:02.659
This is my yard.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.327
Twenty-one thirty-two
South Gate, right?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.204
Yeah, but the house
isn't for sale.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.622
I just put the signs
where they tell me to.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.540
All right, well,
they told you wrong, so...

04:09.582 --> 04:11.084
take care of it, please.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.460
Hey!

04:12.502 --> 04:14.170
Wait, what's going on?

04:14.212 --> 04:15.296
Ah, don't worry, don't worry.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.631
I'm calling Milton right now.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.174
Is he selling the place?

-[voice mail]  Hey, it's Milton.
-It's voice mail.

-[voice mail]  Leave a message.
-[beep]

Yo, Milton, it's Lip.
Just call me back

04:24.347 --> 04:25.765
as soon as you get this,
all right?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.392
Wondering why there's, uh,
some guy

04:27.433 --> 04:29.352
putting a real estate sign
in my yard.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.229
Thanks.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.231
[Tami] Shit.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.527
Whoop.
Big day for Franny and I.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.653
We're going to the playground,

04:38.695 --> 04:40.280
then we're gonna get some lunch
at White Castle,

04:40.321 --> 04:42.156
and then we're gonna go
and meet

04:42.198 --> 04:44.575
Her Royal Highness
Queen Justice.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.078
Wait, isn't that
the WWE lady?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.329
Uh, the lady?

04:48.371 --> 04:49.539
Don't you mean the queen?

04:49.580 --> 04:51.958
-Y'all been served!
-[Debbie laughs]

04:52.000 --> 04:52.959
What?

04:53.001 --> 04:54.210
Yeah.
[laughs]

04:54.252 --> 04:55.378
That's her catchphrase.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.587
Franny is obsessed with her.

[both chuckle]

04:59.215 --> 05:00.258
And you get to meet her?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.343
Yeah, she's gonna be
at Kevlar Comics all day.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.845
I paid ten bucks
to get a parent pass

05:03.886 --> 05:06.055
so we could get a photo
with her.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.266
Wow.
Queen Justice.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.559
[Debbie] So?

05:09.600 --> 05:11.936
You wanna come?
It'll be super fun.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.855
Uh, no, I can't.

05:13.896 --> 05:14.689
Why?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.524
I just got stuff to do.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.318
Like what?

05:19.235 --> 05:20.653
Stuff.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.363
Okay.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.284
-[Debbie] Hey.
-[Sandy] Ooh, cargo pants.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.493
Don't mess with this white guy.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.578
Yeah, I feel
like most weed dealers

05:28.619 --> 05:30.163
just wear sweatpants
and slides, but...

05:30.204 --> 05:31.831
Not a weed dealer.
Mickey!

05:31.873 --> 05:34.208
Shut the fuck up.
I'm coming.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.421
-The fuck you doing?
-Coffee.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.423
-We gotta go. We're late.
-[Mickey] Okay.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.549
We'll get coffee on the way.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.426
Oh, my G--stop nagging me!

05:43.468 --> 05:44.802
-How am I nagging you?
-You're talking.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.596
-Definitely married.
-Shut the fuck up.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.723
-You shut the fuck up too.
-[laughs]

05:48.765 --> 05:51.142
Hey, I gotta do some laundry.
You want anything washed?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.352
No, I'm good.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.437
Mm, how about these?

05:54.479 --> 05:56.189
Uh, yeah, sure.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.775
When you take your photo
with Queen Justice,

05:58.816 --> 05:59.692
will you give it to me?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.361
-[Franny] No!
-[Sandy] No?

06:01.402 --> 06:02.737
But I really want it.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.197
[Franny laughs] No!

06:04.238 --> 06:05.239
No?
Please.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.492
Hey, are these yours?

06:07.533 --> 06:10.703
Uh, yeah, thanks.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.664
Do you own a car?

06:13.706 --> 06:14.916
Yeah.
Why?

06:14.957 --> 06:17.460
I don't know. You've never
mentioned it before.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.129
[sighs]
I own a car.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.006
Where is it?

06:22.840 --> 06:25.259
It's parked on the street.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.929
Okay.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.807
Would you like to see it?

06:30.848 --> 06:32.475
No, I don't need to see it.
I just think it's weird

06:32.517 --> 06:35.144
that you've never mentioned it
before.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.729
It's really not.

rock music

06:49.492 --> 06:50.660
[sighs]

06:50.701 --> 06:52.078
[Sandy] And here's another one.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.498
Damn if the boys in this family
don't love wearing costumes.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.083
Can I just shoot her already?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.293
[Sandy] Well, you better
make sure it's fatal.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.753
Come at the king,
you'd best not miss.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.754
Yeah, don't you worry.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.381
Two to the chest,
one to the head,

07:03.423 --> 07:04.715
just like they taught us
in the academy.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.426
[Sandy scoffs] All right.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.261
Well, I gotta run.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.804
You guys have fun today.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.098
-You too.
-[Sandy] Bye, Franny.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.307
Y'all been served!

07:13.349 --> 07:14.767
Oh!

07:15.893 --> 07:18.479
The Milkoviches
are killing me.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.064
Jeez, you look terrible.
You even sleep?

07:20.106 --> 07:22.567
I can't sleep. They throw shit
at my window all night.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.235
Ugh.
I'm sorry.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.736
And that stupid racist dog.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.530
They trained it to bark
my name.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.906
He's not barking your name.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.491
[Debbie] Don't worry about it.
You'll have the whole house

07:30.533 --> 07:31.993
to yourself today.
Just take a nap.

07:32.034 --> 07:32.785
Wait.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.953
You're leaving me here
by myself?

07:33.995 --> 07:35.663
Sorry, dude.
I gotta work.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.748
You'll be fine.
Just go back to sleep.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.918
Okay, come on, Franny.
Let's go.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.545
Let's put you
in your Queen Justice costume.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.755
Y'all been served!

07:49.427 --> 07:50.511
[sighs]

07:50.553 --> 07:53.639
[dogs snarling, barking]

07:54.098 --> 07:58.144
Barkeep, a beer and a glass
of tomato juice, please.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.729
[Kev] Ha-ha! Hungover?

07:59.770 --> 08:02.064
[Frank] Of course,
but that's not why.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.650
I tried to ignore
the Milkovich hot spot,

08:04.692 --> 08:07.278
but yet again,
science wins.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.781
Pretending a virus isn't real
doesn't make it harmless.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.825
Here's an idea.
Why don't you talk to them?

08:12.867 --> 08:15.369
-[Kev] We tried.
-No, you tried to trick them.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.662
I'm saying talk to them.

08:16.704 --> 08:17.830
Listen to their concerns.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.915
Express your concerns.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.458
Have an actual conversation.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.960
V, you act like these
are human beings.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.338
Well, nothing else has worked.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.506
It's worth a shot.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.342
Oh, Jesus, I don't know
what's more toxic,

08:29.383 --> 08:30.968
their filth
or your optimism.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.929
What's up
with the fancy outfit?

08:32.970 --> 08:34.305
-Parole hearing?
-No.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.433
I like to look nice for men
who have nothing better to do

08:37.475 --> 08:39.685
than sit in a bar all day.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.145
Alderman sent over
a list of people

08:41.187 --> 08:43.397
who didn't vote
in the last election,

08:43.439 --> 08:44.815
so I am going door-to-door

08:44.857 --> 08:46.442
to get them to the polls.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.819
You can skip my house.
I'll be here.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.821
Black people.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.823
We need to get
this rent control bill passed

08:52.865 --> 08:55.993
so Black people can afford
to stay in the neighborhood.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.620
Tell them to stop paying rent.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.080
That's what the Milkoviches do.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.415
Where do people like that
come from in the first place?

09:01.457 --> 09:02.625
[Veronica] The South.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.626
Once they realized

09:03.668 --> 09:05.419
they had to start
picking the cotton,

09:05.461 --> 09:07.004
they migrated to the Midwest

09:07.046 --> 09:09.549
to take part
in our industrial economy.

09:09.590 --> 09:13.010
No, the Milkovich clan
came here from Poland

09:13.052 --> 09:15.555
after the Polish-Russian War.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.557
For some reason,
when white people lose a war,

09:17.598 --> 09:19.433
they all move to Chicago.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.435
[Kev] All right, Frank.
You ready?

09:21.936 --> 09:22.812
[Frank] Can't you do it?

09:22.853 --> 09:24.522
No.
Come on, we're a team.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.732
-Who've never won a game.
-[Kev] Exactly.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.651
That's why the Milkoviches
will listen to us.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.903
We're relatable.
We're not Jordan and Pippen.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.114
We're Tommy and Kermit.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.783
I'm surprised
they didn't ask you

09:35.825 --> 09:37.368
to coach the Bulls.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.412
-Come on.
-[Frank] Fine.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.247
Let's get this over with.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.462
Yo!

09:49.422 --> 09:51.924
[Milton]
Oh, shit, shit. Shit.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.634
I told them not to put it up
before ten.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.678
I'm sorry you had to find out
like this, man.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.888
I was definitely gonna tell you
before the sign went up.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.099
-What, so this is for real?
-[door opens]

10:00.141 --> 10:01.892
[Milton] Oh, hey, Tami.
How's it going?

10:01.934 --> 10:03.769
You know, I got a letter
in the mail last week

10:03.811 --> 10:05.021
from this guy, uh, Larry.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.606
I called him back,
and he told me,

10:06.647 --> 10:08.733
you know, what he thought
I'd get for the house.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.109
You know how it is these days.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.527
You gotta scrape together
whatever you can, man.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.737
That doesn't mean
you can kick people

10:12.778 --> 10:14.030
out of their fucking houses.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.573
I know, look,
you put a lot of work

10:15.615 --> 10:16.657
-in the place.
-Yeah.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.742
And I told you
I'll reimburse you,

10:17.783 --> 10:18.868
you know, for the repairs
and the labor.

10:18.909 --> 10:19.994
Damn right, you will,
but now we got

10:20.036 --> 10:21.746
-a bigger problem.
-[Tami] Yeah.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.664
Like where we're gonna live.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.665
If it sells, you'll have
plenty of time

10:24.707 --> 10:26.000
to find another place.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.420
The guy said it'll be in escrow
for, like, 60 to 90 days.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.422
Either way, man,
it's a dick move.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.967
I know, man.
I'm sorry.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.469
I needed the money.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.388
Hey, you mind if I go inside?

10:39.430 --> 10:40.681
I told Larry here
I'd take some pictures,

10:40.723 --> 10:42.224
you know, for the website.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.268
Yeah, we mind.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.645
[Lip] No, no, no.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.647
It's all right.
Just go ahead.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.273
Man, I'm sorry, Lip.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.691
[Lip] Yeah, yeah.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.532
[Tami] Shit.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.077
Fuck.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.079
[Tami] I don't care
if that bitch owns the house.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.121
He can't just kick us out.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.207
I mean, what's it say
in the lease?

11:07.375 --> 11:08.084
Lease?

11:08.125 --> 11:09.210
[Tami] Yeah.
We should look at it,

11:09.251 --> 11:10.628
see how much notice
he has to give us.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.254
Yeah, no, I mean,
there-there's not a lease.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.923
You know, it was more
of a, uh...

11:13.964 --> 11:16.467
handshake kind of agreement.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.802
You're kidding.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.595
Nope.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.097
Jesus, Lip.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.182
A handshake?
Oh, my God.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.393
Fucking South Siders.
I...

11:25.434 --> 11:28.062
So Milton can just kick us out
tomorrow if he feels like it?

11:28.104 --> 11:29.730
But he-he won't, okay?

11:29.772 --> 11:32.858
Uh, he just put
a "For Sale" sign

11:32.900 --> 11:34.068
in the yard, so...

11:34.110 --> 11:35.403
Look, I will talk to him,
all right?

11:35.444 --> 11:37.738
If he still wants to sell,
we will find another place,

11:37.780 --> 11:38.864
or...

11:38.906 --> 11:40.908
I mean, we could even maybe buy
our own place.

11:40.950 --> 11:41.992
With what?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.619
Ah, the money I'm gonna get
from the bike,

11:43.661 --> 11:45.788
whatever Milton gives us
for the repairs,

11:45.830 --> 11:46.956
and then, you know,
what you bring in

11:46.997 --> 11:48.082
from the salon,
that could be enough

11:48.124 --> 11:49.750
for a down payment.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.669
Hey, come on.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.088
You know,
we'll go look at some places.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.383
I don't know.
Could be fun.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.678
[sighs]

12:00.720 --> 12:02.388
-Yeah.
-Oh.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.725
[Kev] Hey, neighbors.

12:07.768 --> 12:08.894
What you got there?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.730
Found a deer last night
on the side of the road.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.441
After I, uh, hit it
with my truck.

12:13.482 --> 12:14.233
Jackpot.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.026
[Kev] So you're gonna...
cook it?

12:16.068 --> 12:17.778
[Sammy]
That's the plan.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.904
Can't let it go to waste.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.533
Course not.
Fresh roadkill, you kidding?

12:23.492 --> 12:26.871
So Frank and I were thinking,
now that we're neighbors,

12:26.912 --> 12:28.789
uh, it might be a good time
to have a chat.

12:28.831 --> 12:29.957
About what?

12:29.999 --> 12:32.752
[Kev] Just, you know,
how to be a good neighbor.

12:32.793 --> 12:33.794
What could we do better?

12:33.836 --> 12:36.380
Maybe there are things
that you can do better

12:36.422 --> 12:38.215
or-or just not do.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.800
W-what Kev's trying to say is,

12:39.842 --> 12:41.218
we're gonna do things
that bother you,

12:41.260 --> 12:43.554
and you'll do things
that bother us.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.930
That's America.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.641
Freedom and boundaries
don't mix.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.809
I get it.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.394
But if we know

12:50.436 --> 12:53.105
the things that bother
our neighbors,

12:53.147 --> 12:55.983
maybe we don't do them...

12:56.025 --> 12:57.109
anymore.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.652
Everybody wins.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.196
Yeah, okay, I get it.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.990
-Sammy?
-Makes sense.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.492
Ready?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.161
Yeah, do it.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.122
rock music

13:16.545 --> 13:19.590
[screaming]

13:23.969 --> 13:25.638
God!

13:25.679 --> 13:27.097
Yeah!

13:27.139 --> 13:28.849
[Sammy] Yeah!

13:28.891 --> 13:31.644
[laughing]

13:31.685 --> 13:33.062
-Yeah!
-Cool.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.730
Well, I think
that about covers it.

13:34.772 --> 13:35.940
Frank, anything?

13:35.981 --> 13:38.192
No, I feel like
we're on the same page.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.152
[Kev] Okay, great.
You guys take care.

13:40.194 --> 13:43.489
[grunts, sighs]

13:43.531 --> 13:44.156
Huh?

13:49.119 --> 13:51.372
Hey, this one looks
pretty good.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.084
That is, uh, Milton's house.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.627
We live there.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.505
Oh.
Shit.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.592
$299,000?
[laughs]

14:03.634 --> 14:04.593
What?
No.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.719
No, no one's gonna pay that.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.429
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.140
$300,000 for a house
on the South Side?

14:10.182 --> 14:12.351
Please, like,
who has that kind of money?

14:12.393 --> 14:14.895
Actually, there are already
multiple offers.

14:14.937 --> 14:15.729
What?

14:15.771 --> 14:17.356
All at or above list.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.359
There's gonna be a bidding war,
sight unseen.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.486
A bidding war
on the South Side?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.364
[Tami]
$300,000, yeah.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.449
So much for talking Milton
out of selling.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.200
Yeah, no shit.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.911
Looking to buy a house?

14:30.953 --> 14:31.912
Uh, doubt it.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.706
I mean, I didn't realize
the South Side

14:33.747 --> 14:35.165
was a seller's market.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.835
What about this one?
It's only $110,000.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.087
bluesy rock music

14:40.129 --> 14:41.046
Yeah, it's not bad.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.965
Can we check this one out?

14:43.007 --> 14:45.968
Uh, of course.
[chuckles] Anytime.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.682
[Lip] Oh.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.850
What?

14:54.810 --> 14:56.562
[Lip] Nothing.
Uh...

14:56.604 --> 14:57.813
yeah, no, I just, uh--

14:57.855 --> 14:59.273
I gotta go to BornFree, um,

14:59.315 --> 15:01.609
but, you know,
we can check it out at lunch.

15:01.650 --> 15:02.985
-That work?
-Yeah.

15:03.027 --> 15:03.903
-Meet you there.
-[Lip] Cool.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.738
You want to come in?
Okay.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.634
This tracker says Sandy's at
some random apartment building.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.011
Is that where she lives?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.387
Mama, out!

15:30.429 --> 15:33.849
low rock music

15:33.891 --> 15:36.101
Sorry, Franny.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.733
I don't even know
where she lives.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.904
[Mickey] All right,
where's the next cash pickup?

15:46.946 --> 15:50.240
[Ian]
Uh, Green Gate, then over to...

15:50.282 --> 15:51.283
Herbal Care.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.326
[Mickey] Herbal Care?

15:52.368 --> 15:54.328
That's a new one.
Where's it at?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.830
Yo, could you
not ignore me, please?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.207
-Hello!
-What?

15:58.248 --> 16:00.292
-Where's Herbal Care?
-It's, uh--

16:00.334 --> 16:02.127
I-I don't know.
I think we're being followed.

16:02.169 --> 16:05.255
We're not being followed, man.
It's called traffic.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.299
No, this guy's been behind us
since we left the grow house.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.551
"Oh, I think we're being
followed, man!" [laughs]

16:09.593 --> 16:11.178
Yeah, and I'm the one
who fucking nags, right?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.138
Oh, come on.
I'm just giving you shit.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.849
[tires screeching]

16:15.891 --> 16:17.267
-Fuck!
-Shit.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.352
-Shit.
-Fuck!

16:18.394 --> 16:19.979
I fucking told you.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.105
Well, congratulations.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.022
You were right.
You happy?

16:22.064 --> 16:23.023
We gotta run.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.692
Out, now.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.986
Shit.

16:27.027 --> 16:27.778
Now!

16:27.820 --> 16:29.947
All right.
God damn it.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.991
bass guitar music

16:32.032 --> 16:33.200
-Oh.
-Move!

16:33.242 --> 16:34.284
Fuck!

16:34.326 --> 16:36.370
[robber]
Calm down, tough guy.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.665
I will shoot you in the nuts!

16:41.583 --> 16:43.377
Lou?

16:43.419 --> 16:45.087
-You know this guy?
-[Lou] Shut up.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.505
Ain't nobody here named Lou.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.966
I can see the fucking tattoo
on your hand says Lou.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.680
Shit.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.641
-What's up, Mickey?
-[Mickey] You're an idiot.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.600
That's what's up.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.102
Can we go now?
I got shit to do, man.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.311
Afraid not.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.688
I'm your cousin, asshole.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.606
Give me my bags.
Get the fuck out of the way.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.400
Sorry, man.
We got a job to do.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.068
Oh, you got a job?
I do too, bitch.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.696
[robber]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.284
Is that an airsoft pistol?

17:17.619 --> 17:18.746
No.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.957
That's an airsoft gun.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.208
I can see where you painted

17:23.250 --> 17:24.626
over the orange tip
of the barrel.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.837
[laughter]

17:27.546 --> 17:29.214
Can you not afford a real gun?

17:29.256 --> 17:32.468
No, I-I have a real gun.
It's just...

17:32.509 --> 17:35.304
if I get caught with it,
I go to prison, and some people

17:35.345 --> 17:36.346
are very uncomfortable
with that.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.932
We're on parole!
We're on parole.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.017
[sighs]

17:40.059 --> 17:41.727
Well, now I feel bad.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.896
Tell you what.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.481
Since you're family,

17:45.522 --> 17:48.317
we're only gonna take, uh,

17:48.358 --> 17:49.777
1,000 bucks.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.445
All right?

17:51.487 --> 17:52.946
Can't leave empty-handed,
you know.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.490
We got mouths to feed.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.242
No, uh, yeah, thank you
for being so fucking generous.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.911
[Lou] You're welcome.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.245
Hey. I'll see you
at Thanksgiving.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.456
Yeah, okay.
Fuck you.

18:02.498 --> 18:06.168
[engine turning over]

18:06.210 --> 18:09.046
[tires squealing]

18:10.881 --> 18:12.257
Unbelievable.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.344
There goes our profit
for the week.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.137
Don't make this shit
like it's my fault.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.597
I'm not blaming you.
I'm just saying.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.265
You're just saying
that we should've had

18:20.307 --> 18:21.683
-a real fucking gun...
-I'm just saying...

18:21.725 --> 18:23.268
-...like I've been saying...
-...it's your inbred...

18:23.310 --> 18:24.937
-...from the fucking beginning!
-...Polack fucking family.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.563
We are--

18:27.022 --> 18:28.232
[shopkeeper]
Thank you for coming.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.149
Damn shoplifters

18:29.191 --> 18:30.234
-took a bunch of stuff.
-Mm.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.443
That's one of them right there.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.320
-The others ran away.
-Mm.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.154
How'd you catch him?

18:34.196 --> 18:35.572
[shopkeeper] Pepper spray.

18:35.614 --> 18:39.701
[Leesie] Okay, and then you
tied him to a rack

18:39.743 --> 18:41.662
using belts.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.455
Exactly.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.457
I like your style.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.168
[sighs]
What's your name?

18:48.210 --> 18:50.129
-Saquon.
-[Leesie] Mm.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.630
-Pepper spray burn, don't it?
-No.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.216
No?
Oh, you a tough guy.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.176
Okay.
All right.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.971
Well, just so you know...

19:00.264 --> 19:01.640
...it only gets worse
from here.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.559
-Ow, you're hurting me.
-Move your ass.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.144
-Come on, Gallagher.
-Come on, lady.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.228
[Leesie]
Instead of shoplifting,

19:06.270 --> 19:08.188
how about you lift
some damn weights?

19:08.230 --> 19:11.525
One thing
you ain't gotta steal: food.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.989
Hey.
Look, it's cute.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.077
So you know this house?

19:22.119 --> 19:23.162
Of course.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.705
Then you know
why it's so cheap.

19:24.746 --> 19:25.831
Yeah.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.124
But, uh, she doesn't.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.417
I'd like to keep it that way.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.252
Not gonna get
an argument from me.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.796
Thing's been
on the market for years.

19:33.797 --> 19:34.923
You coming?

19:34.965 --> 19:37.217
Yep.
See what we got.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.971
Officer Gallagher,
can you do me a favor?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.389
[sighs]
Yes, ma'am.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.183
In the trunk,
there's a machete.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.059
You mind bringing it
to me, please?

19:46.101 --> 19:47.769
A machete?

19:47.811 --> 19:49.062
Yeah, my machete.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.572
-See it?
-[Carl] Uh, yeah.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.704
[breathing heavily]

20:05.746 --> 20:08.332
You ever been
to Iraq, Saquon?

20:08.373 --> 20:09.666
-No.
-No?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.627
Ooh, I loved it over there.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.921
I did not wanna come home.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.547
Now, in Iraq,

20:15.589 --> 20:18.008
you steal,
you don't go to jail.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.385
Nah, they cut off your hand.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.596
Punishment fits the crime, see?

20:22.638 --> 20:23.639
-Leesie...
-Gallagher,

20:23.680 --> 20:25.349
don't just stand there.
Come here.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.683
Keep this bitch from squirming.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.644
It's gonna take a couple hacks
for this hand to come off.

20:28.685 --> 20:31.980
dramatic oud and drum
music

20:32.022 --> 20:33.774
Here we go.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.359
[screams]

20:35.400 --> 20:37.361
[panting]

20:37.402 --> 20:38.820
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:38.862 --> 20:40.072
Look at me.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.698
This was just a warning.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.951
I catch you stealing again,

20:43.992 --> 20:46.078
this hand's coming off.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.414
Go home.
Change your pants.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.504
Scared Straight
ain't got nothing on my shit.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.221
How'd it go?
Did you bury the hatchet?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.639
The virus has mutated.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.308
You okay, baby?
What's wrong?

21:08.350 --> 21:10.602
So much.
So much is wrong.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.895
[Frank] I don't know.
You think?

21:11.937 --> 21:15.190
I thought we got to a pretty
good place there at the end.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.316
What happened?

21:16.358 --> 21:17.776
[Kev] Well, one of them
was skinning a deer,

21:17.818 --> 21:20.112
and then the other one
was branding himself.

21:20.153 --> 21:20.862
What?

21:20.904 --> 21:22.197
[Kev]
Right in their front yard.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.573
-We have to move.
-We're not moving.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.827
It's like living next
to the Manson family, V.

21:26.868 --> 21:27.869
The blood?

21:27.911 --> 21:29.579
[Veronica] I gotta get back out
to finding Black folks.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.415
That's the only thing
that's gonna fix this.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.582
Get out the vote.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.501
This is our home, not theirs.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.336
If anyone's moving, it's them.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.757
Maybe this is it,

21:40.799 --> 21:44.094
the final stop
in Caucasian evolution:

21:44.136 --> 21:46.596
white trash.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.141
In the end,

21:49.182 --> 21:51.393
we'll all be Milkoviches.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.438
low bass music

21:57.941 --> 22:00.235
[liquid dripping]

22:00.277 --> 22:03.196
Six shots of vodka

22:03.238 --> 22:05.449
Three bottles of wine

22:05.490 --> 22:09.995
And I don't know
where I am

22:12.622 --> 22:15.459
Five seconds,
I need a moment

22:15.500 --> 22:18.170
When I stare
into space

22:18.211 --> 22:19.463
Let's roll

22:19.504 --> 22:23.592
Find common ground

22:23.633 --> 22:25.218
Yeah, yeah, yeah

22:25.260 --> 22:27.387
[screams]

22:28.221 --> 22:29.890
[screams]

22:34.061 --> 22:36.813
-Now she's at a restaurant.
-Y'all been served!

22:36.855 --> 22:38.690
A restaurant,
an apartment building.

22:38.732 --> 22:42.027
What's next, Sandy,
a truck stop bathroom?

22:42.069 --> 22:45.072
[realtor] Lots of closet space,
built-ins.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.574
Floors are in great shape.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.701
I love this bannister.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.244
[realtor]
Mm-hmm.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.413
Oh.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.421
Oh, there's
a great backyard too.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.839
There's even a tire swing!

23:02.881 --> 23:05.050
Oh, my God.
Fred would love that one day.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.343
[Lip] Oh, yeah.

23:07.427 --> 23:08.762
[Tami]
Hey, what's in this room?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.597
This room?
Oh, it's so weird.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.015
It's-it's locked.
Oh, well.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.767
They've been doing
some work in there.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.352
Fumes are real strong.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.187
-There you go.
-Hmm.

23:18.105 --> 23:21.191
Well, what do you think?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.193
Yeah, maybe.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.112
"Yeah, maybe"?

23:25.946 --> 23:29.408
It's only $110,000.
We could own a house.

23:29.449 --> 23:31.243
[realtor] The seller
would probably be willing

23:31.284 --> 23:32.661
to come down from that.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.746
You said come-come down
from $110,000?

23:34.788 --> 23:36.623
[realtor] And they're prepared
to finance

23:36.665 --> 23:39.084
with only five percent down.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.794
Why is it so cheap?

23:40.836 --> 23:42.796
It's been on the market
for a while.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.297
The electrical's
never been updated.

23:44.339 --> 23:47.467
The kitchen and bathrooms
need work.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.511
That's why.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.638
[Tami] Well, you could fix
that stuff,

23:51.680 --> 23:53.598
just like you did
at Milton's place.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.851
I'm not an electrician,
but, uh,

23:55.892 --> 23:57.602
we could ask Tommy
if he'd come take a look,

23:57.644 --> 24:00.188
see how much it might cost
to get updated.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.108
[faint crying]

24:03.150 --> 24:04.401
Is that a baby?

24:04.443 --> 24:05.569
Mm, no, no.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.155
I think that was
a-a cat outside, right?

24:08.196 --> 24:09.239
Well, we should get going.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.159
Unfortunately,
I have another appointment.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.410
[Lip] Yep.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.830
So, uh, let's go talk
to Tommy, huh?

24:16.872 --> 24:20.000
Yeah, uh, but don't you
have to get back to work?

24:20.041 --> 24:23.003
I'll call Brad.
He'll understand.

24:23.044 --> 24:23.920
Okay.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.797
cheerful music

24:25.839 --> 24:29.885
[muttering indistinctly]

24:29.926 --> 24:34.055
Miss Rose.
I love Miss Rose.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.641
[sighs]

24:41.730 --> 24:43.356
[doorbell rings]

24:46.610 --> 24:47.569
Da.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.696
What the hell?
You're not Miss Rose.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.281
Miss Rose moved to Glenwood.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.782
I bought the house from her.

24:52.824 --> 24:53.950
Guess I need
to update my list.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.578
Can I talk to you
about the upcoming election?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.205
-Sure.
-We need people

24:58.246 --> 25:00.624
to get out and vote
for the rent control bill.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.417
-Vote for it?
-Yes.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.711
I'm totally against it.

25:04.753 --> 25:05.962
Why?

25:06.004 --> 25:08.006
I own a couple
of apartment buildings here.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.177
When is the election again?

25:12.219 --> 25:14.304
I wouldn't wanna miss it.

25:18.808 --> 25:22.270
Mmm!
God, I love queso.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.523
You can't find this shit
in a real Mexican restaurant.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.566
You gotta go
to a Tex-Mex joint.

25:27.984 --> 25:30.862
You know, you were kind of hard
on that kid earlier.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.740
Oh, you mean the punk
that I let go free?

25:33.782 --> 25:36.326
I'm pretty sure he's never
gonna shoplift again.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.994
Look, you're not
from around here.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.704
That's not always how it works.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.790
That kid,
he was just acting tough.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.125
Now he's gonna grow up
hating cops.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.711
Let me ask you something,
Gallagher.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.213
What kind of cop
you wanna be?

25:48.255 --> 25:50.340
-I wanna be--
-Shut up! That was rhetorical.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.717
I'ma tell you exactly what kind
of cop you gonna be.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.094
The true-blue kind,

25:54.135 --> 25:55.971
the kind who has my back,
no matter what.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.597
You question the way
I police my neighborhood

25:57.639 --> 25:59.057
one more time,
you and me's gonna have words,

25:59.099 --> 26:01.768
and by "words," I mean
I will fuck you up.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.270
We clear?

26:04.646 --> 26:05.897
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.066
[cell phone rings]

26:10.151 --> 26:11.528
What's up?

26:11.570 --> 26:12.779
I need you to pick me up.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.905
[Carl]
What? No.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.448
I'm working, man.
I have a job.

26:15.490 --> 26:16.616
I'll ride with you
in the cop car.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.160
No, you can't ride around
with us in the cop car.

26:19.202 --> 26:21.371
-Who's that?
-It's my little brother.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.747
No, he can't ride around
with us.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.583
Yeah, I know.
Where are you?

26:24.624 --> 26:26.001
On the streets,
where it's safe.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.252
[Carl]
All right, go to The Alibi.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.170
I'll pick you up there later.
All right?

26:29.212 --> 26:30.463
Bye.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.217
[Debbie] Now it says
she's at some place

26:34.259 --> 26:35.719
called Ends Meet.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.178
What the hell is Ends Meet?

26:37.220 --> 26:38.722
[bystander]
That's a strip club.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.223
What?
It is?

26:40.265 --> 26:42.434
Why would Sandy
be at a strip club?

26:42.475 --> 26:44.102
-Is she a stripper?
-No.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.353
Uh...

26:45.395 --> 26:46.896
I don't know.
Maybe.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.648
[Franny] Mama.

26:48.690 --> 26:49.774
Mama.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.651
[bystander] Maybe she just
wanted a lap dance.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.153
Yeah, yeah, sure.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.988
[bystander] Hopefully
that's all she wanted.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.781
Ends Meet
is a full-service club,

26:56.823 --> 26:58.408
if you know what I mean.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.784
What, like they sell drugs?

26:59.826 --> 27:01.661
-[Franny] Mama.
-What, Franny?

27:01.703 --> 27:02.787
How much longer?

27:02.829 --> 27:03.997
I don't know, Franny.
Be patient.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.165
They sell everything.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.875
Place is
a straight-up ho house.

27:06.916 --> 27:07.834
How do you know?

27:07.876 --> 27:09.210
My daughter
used to work there.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.171
She's a ho.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.464
Shit.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.965
I fly

27:14.007 --> 27:16.009
bluesy rock music

27:16.051 --> 27:17.927
Till I close my eyes

27:20.388 --> 27:22.849
I just fly

27:22.891 --> 27:26.770
Oh, the sky

27:26.811 --> 27:29.522
I should've kept you

27:29.564 --> 27:31.816
In the sky...

27:31.858 --> 27:35.528
Oh!
Something on your mind?

27:35.570 --> 27:37.822
-Milkoviches.
-You too?

27:37.864 --> 27:38.948
What'd they do?

27:38.990 --> 27:40.075
It was a head,

27:40.116 --> 27:42.285
an animal's head, upstairs.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.662
Jesus Christ.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.664
That's it!

27:45.705 --> 27:48.124
No more conversation.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.877
No more good-neighbor charade.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.921
The only way to get through
to these people

27:52.962 --> 27:55.256
is to whack that bitch.

27:55.298 --> 27:55.924
What bitch?

27:55.965 --> 27:58.343
The host, Old Lady McCurdy.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.928
She's gotta go.

27:59.969 --> 28:00.887
Once she's dead,

28:00.929 --> 28:03.014
the house will go
to the next of kin,

28:03.056 --> 28:04.724
and they'll evict
the Milkoviches.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.685
Frank, you can't kill
Mrs. McCurdy.

28:06.726 --> 28:08.144
[Frank] We have to!

28:08.186 --> 28:09.688
We've got to kill the host.

28:09.729 --> 28:12.649
Otherwise, the Milkoviches
will live there forever.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.192
Are you in or not?

28:14.234 --> 28:16.569
Oh, I am most definitely
not in.

28:17.946 --> 28:21.408
I-I get you.
That's...that's smart.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.035
No, Frank, I'm not kidding.
I'm not in.

28:24.077 --> 28:26.037
No, I-I hear you.
You're "not in."

28:26.079 --> 28:27.539
Obviously,
you don't hear me,

28:27.580 --> 28:28.832
because you put "not in"
in quotes.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.417
[Frank] The problem is,
the Milkoviches

28:30.458 --> 28:32.919
aren't gonna let us
just walk in and kill her.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.880
We gotta find a way to get them
away from the house.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.507
Frank, there's no us.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.426
There's no we.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.927
I thought we were a team!

28:40.969 --> 28:43.555
Yeah, well, we were,
and now we're not.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.141
[Frank]
Unbelievable.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.768
Once again,
it is up to Frank Gallagher

28:48.810 --> 28:50.770
to save the damn neighborhood.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.480
V's actually saving
the neighborhood.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.898
Oh, really?
How?

28:53.940 --> 28:58.069
By going door-to-door
handing out flyers?

28:59.779 --> 29:01.448
Wait, that could work.

29:01.489 --> 29:02.699
What?

29:02.741 --> 29:03.658
Huh.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.830
Hello, gay relatives.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.167
[Kev] Weed's here.

29:12.208 --> 29:13.752
Hey, you're lucky
the guys who robbed us

29:13.793 --> 29:14.919
only wanted the cash.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.296
Can you--
no one's gonna hire us

29:16.337 --> 29:17.589
if everyone knows
we got robbed.

29:17.630 --> 29:18.590
You guys got robbed?

29:18.631 --> 29:19.466
I guess the word's out

29:19.507 --> 29:21.801
we're hauling large amounts
of cash.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.511
Yeah, sorry about that.

29:23.553 --> 29:24.512
Beer's on me.

29:24.554 --> 29:25.638
It's your fucking family, man.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.599
He's not my family, all right?
He's, like, my...

29:27.640 --> 29:28.558
third cousin or whatever.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.059
Yeah, well, we can't use
the SUV anymore

29:30.101 --> 29:32.520
'cause your third cousin knows
what it's being used for.

29:32.562 --> 29:33.772
He'll rob us every day.

29:33.813 --> 29:35.023
Not if we're carrying.

29:35.064 --> 29:36.858
What were you gonna do,
get in a gunfight

29:36.900 --> 29:38.443
-in the middle of Ashland?
-Yes, that sound great.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.153
I'll shoot the shit
out of that little fucker.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.490
No, what we're gonna need
is a new ride.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.576
Uh!

29:46.618 --> 29:48.828
With your bad self

29:48.870 --> 29:50.747
Say it loud

29:50.789 --> 29:52.832
I'm Black, and I'm proud

29:52.874 --> 29:54.501
Say it loud

29:54.542 --> 29:56.628
- I'm Black, and I'm proud
-[knocking]

29:56.669 --> 29:58.046
Look a-here

29:58.087 --> 29:59.839
Some people say
we got a lot of malice

29:59.881 --> 30:02.383
Some say
it's a lot of nerve

30:02.425 --> 30:03.968
But I say
we won't quit moving

30:04.010 --> 30:06.137
Until we get
what we deserve

30:06.179 --> 30:08.181
We've been 'buked

30:08.223 --> 30:10.183
And we've been scorned

30:10.225 --> 30:12.602
We've been treated bad,
talked about

30:12.644 --> 30:14.229
As sure as you born

30:14.270 --> 30:18.274
Just as sure as it take
two eyes to make a pair

30:18.316 --> 30:20.819
Brother, we can't quit

30:20.860 --> 30:23.154
Until we get our share

30:23.196 --> 30:24.322
Say it loud

30:24.364 --> 30:26.991
I'm Black, and I'm proud

30:27.033 --> 30:28.201
Say it loud

30:28.243 --> 30:29.828
I'm Black, and I'm proud

30:29.869 --> 30:32.288
One more time,
say it loud...

30:32.330 --> 30:35.500
[Veronica] Where are
all the Black people?

30:37.168 --> 30:39.879
-Can I get a bag for these?
-Sure thing.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.468
Guys, check it out.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.053
Unite the Right rally
up at Garfield Park.

30:47.095 --> 30:50.640
-[laughs] Oh, man.
-Hell yeah!

30:50.682 --> 30:52.433
There you go.

30:52.475 --> 30:53.852
Thank you.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.812
Thank you, brother.

30:58.481 --> 31:01.734
This neighborhood
is definitely going to shit.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.321
Hey.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.364
-[Tommy] Hey.
-There he is.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.907
So, uh, Tommy,
we were thinking

31:07.949 --> 31:09.534
of buying this house.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.577
Okay.

31:10.618 --> 31:11.494
And I was wondering

31:11.536 --> 31:12.996
if you would take a look
at the electrical.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.289
All right?
It's pretty ancient, you know?

31:14.330 --> 31:15.790
You might see
what needs to be done,

31:15.832 --> 31:17.292
help us bring down the price
a little.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.918
Happy to.
Where is it?

31:18.960 --> 31:19.878
-It's on Corbin.
-Yeah.

31:19.919 --> 31:22.672
It's, uh...927 Corbin.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.673
[Lip] Mm-hmm.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.133
Nine-two-seven Corbin?

31:25.174 --> 31:27.260
Hey, Tommy, think you can
do it right now?

31:27.302 --> 31:28.761
-Sure, I guess.
-Okay, let's go.

31:28.803 --> 31:29.846
-Wait a minute.
-[Lip] Huh?

31:29.888 --> 31:31.097
No, sorry, Kev.
We're in a rush, and--

31:31.139 --> 31:32.015
[Kev] That's the house.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.057
The house?
No, it's not.

31:33.099 --> 31:34.642
Yeah, the house
from the movie.

31:34.684 --> 31:35.727
What movie?

31:35.768 --> 31:36.978
Yeah, wow,
they shot a movie there?

31:37.020 --> 31:38.313
-That-that's cool.
-[Kev] No, no, no.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.148
The movie's about what happened
in real life at the house.

31:40.189 --> 31:41.941
Come on, Lip.
You know the story.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.776
-Kev...
-What story?

31:44.569 --> 31:47.196
Ten years ago,
a family lived there.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.115
One day, the father
comes back from work,

31:49.157 --> 31:51.326
finds his wife
and his three kids

31:51.367 --> 31:53.703
hanging from a bannister
in the hallway,

31:53.745 --> 31:55.747
gutted like pigs.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.124
Oh, my God.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.292
Mm-hmm.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.335
[Tami] That's awful.

32:00.376 --> 32:03.296
Wait. Lip, did you know this?

32:03.338 --> 32:04.839
How did you not know
about this?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.174
[Kev] The father moved
to Wisconsin

32:06.215 --> 32:08.343
to start a new life,
but he never sold the house.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.678
Finally came back
a couple years ago,

32:10.720 --> 32:11.804
hung himself

32:11.846 --> 32:13.932
from the big oak tree
in the backyard.

32:13.973 --> 32:16.017
-The one with the tire swing?
-[Kev] Yep.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.227
That house has been abandoned
ever since.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.228
It's haunted.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.230
[Lip] No, it's not haunted.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.231
Tami, come on.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.108
Look, it's got
a great backyard,

32:24.150 --> 32:25.276
and it's near a park.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.653
Creepiest thing...

32:26.694 --> 32:28.071
Oh, good, he's got more.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.489
...family was named Slaughter.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.324
They called it
the Slaughter house

32:31.366 --> 32:32.992
before the murders.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.827
[laughing] I mean...

32:36.120 --> 32:39.332
Tami, let's take
one more look at the house,

32:39.374 --> 32:41.584
and if it freaks us out,

32:41.626 --> 32:43.002
we'll walk away.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.719
It does have
a great backyard.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.180
Yes, yes, it does.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.723
Yeah.
Okay.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.933
Great.
All right.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.726
-[Tami] All right.
-[Lip claps hands]

32:58.768 --> 32:59.936
[softly] What the fuck?

33:02.063 --> 33:03.606
-[siren wailing]
-So, uh, what happened

33:03.648 --> 33:05.274
to the whole
"walk the straight and narrow,

33:05.316 --> 33:06.401
don't break the law" bullshit?

33:06.442 --> 33:07.902
Yeah, that was before
we got robbed.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.696
-Uh-huh.
-Here we go.

33:11.948 --> 33:14.033
Uh, hi, hi.
Oh, thank God.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.243
Uh, it's my grandma.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.203
She's having chest pains
and vertigo.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.788
Her blood pressure's
through the roof.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.081
Okay, okay.
Calm down.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.375
-Where is she right now?
-Uh, fifth floor.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.918
-Okay.
-But my cousin's up here.

33:23.960 --> 33:24.877
Thanks.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.796
Thank you.
Ah, but please hurry.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.132
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.176
upbeat rock music

33:35.930 --> 33:36.931
All right, move it.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.307
They're probably already
on the elevator.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.684
God, I'm good.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.784
Finally, a Black woman.

33:56.826 --> 33:57.535
-[laughs]
-Hi.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.996
I am so happy
to see you.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.289
My name is Veronica,

34:01.330 --> 34:02.790
and I'm going
around the neighborhood,

34:02.832 --> 34:04.000
talking to people like you,

34:04.042 --> 34:05.877
just reminding you
to get out and vote

34:05.918 --> 34:07.253
in the upcoming election.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.964
If every Black person
from the South Side voted,

34:10.006 --> 34:11.174
we could get
rent control passed

34:11.215 --> 34:14.135
and stop our Black families
from being forced to move.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.178
What election?

34:15.219 --> 34:16.596
[Veronica] The local election.

34:16.637 --> 34:19.182
The rent control bill
is on the ballot,

34:19.223 --> 34:20.600
and we could really use
your support.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.769
Russia decides
who wins elections.

34:22.810 --> 34:23.936
The whole thing's rigged.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.938
I don't think Russia
gets involved

34:25.980 --> 34:27.231
in the local elections.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.150
Your vote, my vote matter.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.903
To think it doesn't
gives other people the power

34:31.944 --> 34:33.237
to make decisions for us.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.405
Sometimes we have to--

34:34.447 --> 34:36.991
You know, the real enemy
is Obama.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.201
Excuse me?

34:38.242 --> 34:40.161
That damn presidential library
he's building

34:40.203 --> 34:43.289
is gonna make property taxes
go through the roof,

34:43.331 --> 34:44.957
get rid of affordable housing,

34:44.999 --> 34:46.584
1,000 acres' worth,

34:46.626 --> 34:49.170
and it's gonna cost taxpayers
$5 billion.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.255
The Obama Presidential Center

34:51.297 --> 34:53.257
is going to be
privately funded.

34:53.299 --> 34:55.009
By rich white people

34:55.051 --> 34:56.552
trying to make themselves
feel better

34:56.594 --> 34:58.638
about 400 years of oppression.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.515
It's how Obama got elected
in the first place.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.433
Where do you get
your news, woman?

35:02.475 --> 35:05.144
We need South Siders
like President Obama

35:05.186 --> 35:08.106
and his beautiful, badass
Nubian wife queen

35:08.147 --> 35:10.483
to move back
to the South Side.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.235
Obama's from Kenya.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.613
Okay.

35:15.655 --> 35:18.658
[Queen Justice] Here you go.
Thanks for coming out.

35:19.617 --> 35:22.537
-Hi there.
-Oh, my God, she's still there.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.455
I thought that she was too busy
to hang out with us today

35:24.497 --> 35:26.541
because she had stuff to do,
yet she spent the whole day

35:26.582 --> 35:27.792
at the damn strip club.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.085
-Mama?
-What?

35:29.127 --> 35:31.170
How much longer?

35:31.212 --> 35:32.588
What the hell
is taking so long?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.590
What are these people doing?

35:35.925 --> 35:38.928
rock music

35:46.644 --> 35:48.729
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry. Hi.

35:48.771 --> 35:50.064
[bouncer] Excuse me, miss.
You can't just--

35:50.106 --> 35:51.315
-Hi there. I'm so sorry.
-Hold on. Hold on.

35:51.357 --> 35:52.900
You see, my daughter...
she has stage IV cancer,

35:52.942 --> 35:55.528
and, uh, we applied
for the Make-A-Wish Foundation,

35:55.570 --> 35:56.654
but there's
a three-year wait list,

35:56.696 --> 35:58.489
and we just don't have
the time for that.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.741
-So yeah, this is Franny.
-Hi, Franny. How are you?

36:00.783 --> 36:03.327
There we go.
Do your line, Franny.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.829
-Y'all been served!
-You been served!

36:04.871 --> 36:06.289
We have to go
to a doctor's appointment now.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.167
-Thank you so much.
-All right, bye-bye.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.670
-[Frank] Hey, pal.
-Don't touch my gate, drunk.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.798
I'm surprised you're not
already up at the rally.

36:15.840 --> 36:16.841
What rally?

36:16.883 --> 36:20.261
Unite the Right rally
up in Garfield Park.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.013
If there was
a Unite the Right rally,

36:22.054 --> 36:23.306
I'd know about it.

36:23.347 --> 36:26.601
Some kids down the street
were passing these out.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.060
It looks like some sort

36:28.102 --> 36:30.646
of spontaneous protest.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.317
Let me see.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.360
Like a flash mob
for racists.

36:36.402 --> 36:38.571
[Terry] "Unite the Right rally,

36:38.613 --> 36:40.990
Garfield Park, 5 p.m.,

free American pizza, BYOT"?

36:44.285 --> 36:45.953
Torches?

36:45.995 --> 36:47.205
I'm in.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.207
Dust off
the tiki torches, boys.

36:49.248 --> 36:51.042
We got plans tonight.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.210
Ah.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.756
Whoo!

36:59.050 --> 37:00.760
God, I miss this.

37:02.929 --> 37:06.849
[siren wailing]

37:06.891 --> 37:08.142
[both laughing]

37:08.184 --> 37:09.185
Having fun, huh?

37:09.227 --> 37:10.853
-I am.
-Uh-huh.

37:10.895 --> 37:11.687
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

37:11.729 --> 37:12.855
You think that's a good idea,

37:12.897 --> 37:14.440
considering we just stole
this motherfucker?

37:14.482 --> 37:16.359
Turn that shit off.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.944
[wailing stops]

37:19.487 --> 37:22.406
I'm gonna call Debbie
and tell her we need her help

37:22.448 --> 37:24.200
making some modifications.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.911
Hey, does this mean I get
to carry a real gun now?

37:28.329 --> 37:29.580
Hell yeah,

37:29.622 --> 37:30.706
and I need one too,

37:30.748 --> 37:31.916
and not some pansy-ass handgun,
all right?

37:31.958 --> 37:33.876
If someone fucks with me,
I want them staring

37:33.918 --> 37:37.630
down the gaping maw
of a 12-gauge shotgun.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.674
Holy shit, I'm hard.

37:39.715 --> 37:43.094
That may be the hottest thing
I've ever heard you say.

37:43.135 --> 37:46.097
rock music

37:49.225 --> 37:51.102
Oh, hell yeah.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.895
Yup, yup.

38:01.612 --> 38:04.532
-Gonna have to be a quickie.
-Not a problem.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.167
-Oh!
-Oh, shit!

38:15.209 --> 38:16.794
Fuck.

38:19.171 --> 38:20.673
Alive?

38:20.715 --> 38:23.134
Yeah, I'd hope not.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.639
Probably taking him
to the morgue

38:28.681 --> 38:30.308
when they took our call.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.768
Wonder how he died.

38:32.810 --> 38:33.978
Who gives a shit?
What do we do with him?

38:34.020 --> 38:36.230
[Ian] Uh, can't take him
to the emergency room.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.315
It's too risky.

38:37.356 --> 38:38.983
Okay, so dumpster.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.694
Come on, man,
I took an oath.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.864
What oath says you can't dump
a body in a dumpster?

38:46.407 --> 38:48.826
Ah, shit.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.369
[Leesie]
Look at my eyes, Gallagher.

38:50.411 --> 38:53.164
Always scanning
like a damn Cylon.

38:53.205 --> 38:56.334
[imitates trilling]

38:57.918 --> 39:00.212
-Gallagher.

Suspect still on the premises.

39:03.591 --> 39:06.469
Juvenile African American,
age ten to 12.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.803
It's the clothing store again.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.722
Hmm, another little Black kid?

39:09.764 --> 39:11.098
Surely Saquon
ain't that stupid.

39:11.140 --> 39:15.728
If he is, I'm gonna rain down
on that little bastard.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.691
Get your ass in the truck.
Come on, let's go.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.693
Tommy, Timmy,
get in the truck.

39:22.735 --> 39:23.903
[Milkoviches whooping]

39:23.944 --> 39:25.363
Fucking Proud Boys
will get all the free pizza.

39:25.404 --> 39:27.031
-Come on, let's go, boy!
-Whoo!

39:27.073 --> 39:28.407
[engine turning over]

39:28.449 --> 39:30.326
[indistinct shouting]

39:30.368 --> 39:32.078
Yeah! Whoo!

39:32.119 --> 39:33.371
Let's do this.

39:33.412 --> 39:35.122
All right!

39:54.475 --> 39:55.684
[shopkeeper]
He's still in there.

39:55.726 --> 39:58.604
Same motherfucker as before,
and this time, he's got a gun.

39:58.646 --> 39:59.814
-Uh-huh.
-Should we call for backup?

39:59.855 --> 40:01.774
Oh, stop being
such a little bitch.

40:01.816 --> 40:02.817
Damn it, Gallagher.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.902
-You got my back or what?
-Yes, ma'am.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.570
Okay, so go round to the alley.

40:06.612 --> 40:08.572
Make sure that they don't
get out in the back.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.491
I'm going in the front.

40:10.533 --> 40:11.867
Coming for you, Saquon!

40:11.909 --> 40:14.453
I hope you don't like
playing guitar!

40:16.539 --> 40:18.666
[Leesie screams]

40:18.707 --> 40:21.710
energetic music

40:23.462 --> 40:25.923
Shit.
What the hell happened?

40:26.465 --> 40:28.342
[groans]

40:28.384 --> 40:30.386
Bitch pointed his gun at me,

40:30.428 --> 40:32.555
so I took cover,
and I fell on...

40:32.596 --> 40:34.682
fell on my machete.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.060
[clears throat]
Where'd he go?

40:38.102 --> 40:39.395
He ran out.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.313
All right.
Dispatch, 19.

40:41.355 --> 40:42.481
Officer needs
medical attention

40:42.523 --> 40:44.650
over at 44100 Western Ave,
over.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.360
Do not tell anyone
that I fell.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.487
You tell them that, um,

40:48.529 --> 40:51.615
I got attacked
by an 18-year-old with a blade.

40:51.657 --> 40:52.741
Goddamn.

40:52.783 --> 40:53.951
So you mean don't tell them

40:53.993 --> 40:55.828
you literally brought a knife
to a gunfight.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.997
Gallagher!
[yelps]

40:58.038 --> 41:00.875
Don't worry, Sergeant.
I got your back.

41:00.916 --> 41:04.336
[respirator hissing,
monitor beeping]

41:16.599 --> 41:18.476
[Frank] You poor woman.

41:20.686 --> 41:22.521
It'll all be over soon.

41:32.406 --> 41:34.742
Say hello to your husband
for me.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.285

42:11.570 --> 42:13.531
I'm back

42:13.572 --> 42:15.616
[gasping, straining]

42:17.117 --> 42:20.037
We're never gonna find
another place this cheap.

42:20.079 --> 42:23.249
Because no one wants
to live in a murder house.

42:23.290 --> 42:24.875
No, I do.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.505
You knew this whole time,
didn't you?

42:29.547 --> 42:30.923
Son of a bitch.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.592
Look, what other options
do we have, Tami, all right?

42:33.634 --> 42:36.178
If we wanna buy a house...

42:36.220 --> 42:37.346
this is it.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.433
Hey, can we see in this room?

42:51.694 --> 42:53.904
Hey, this is nice.

42:53.946 --> 42:56.448
This was the nursery.

42:58.659 --> 43:00.494
Hold up.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.788
One of the children
that was...

43:02.830 --> 43:04.290
Murdered.

43:05.541 --> 43:08.085
-...was a baby?
-[realtor] Yes.

43:08.669 --> 43:11.046
Hey, why do they keep
the, uh, door locked?

43:11.088 --> 43:13.340
Some people claim
when they're in here,

43:13.382 --> 43:15.968
they can hear a baby crying.

43:16.844 --> 43:20.222
[Lip] That's...ridiculous.

43:21.473 --> 43:22.933
[softly]
Can we have a minute?

43:27.104 --> 43:30.316
You...don't believe
in ghosts, do you?

43:30.357 --> 43:31.650
Yeah, of course not.

43:31.692 --> 43:33.235
Right.
Me neither.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.029
[faint crying]

43:35.070 --> 43:37.114
Wait, do you hear that?

43:41.702 --> 43:43.162
Hear what?

43:50.669 --> 43:52.963
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

43:53.881 --> 43:55.507
Yeah, okay.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.760
-So sad shit happened here.
-Yeah.

43:57.801 --> 43:59.261
But that was a long time ago.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.055
Hey, you know,
once the sellers find out

44:01.096 --> 44:02.139
that we know what happened,

44:02.181 --> 44:04.767
I mean, they'll lower the price
even more.

44:04.808 --> 44:07.603
And everybody's so terrified
of this house,

44:07.645 --> 44:08.771
you know, we'll never have
to worry

44:08.812 --> 44:10.064
about people trying
to break in, and...

44:10.105 --> 44:11.649
Yeah, we won't even have
to lock the doors.

44:11.690 --> 44:14.443
No, it's the safest house
in the neighborhood.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.445
You know, I...

44:16.487 --> 44:18.364
I think we can make it work.

44:23.410 --> 44:24.328
Fuck it.

44:24.370 --> 44:25.079
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.497
-Yeah.
-Let's do it.

44:26.538 --> 44:27.998
Hey.

44:33.545 --> 44:35.130
Thanks for picking me up.

44:35.172 --> 44:36.715
Pretty cool you get
to drive around

44:36.757 --> 44:37.925
in a police car all day.

44:37.966 --> 44:39.677
I don't normally drive,
but my partner

44:39.718 --> 44:41.011
had an accident today.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.971
All right, I gotta go,
but I'll see you later.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.682
Please don't leave me here
all alone.

44:44.723 --> 44:46.642
The Milkoviches
wanna kill me,

44:46.684 --> 44:48.686
and their dog barks my name,

44:48.727 --> 44:50.521
and he's now barking
the N-word.

44:50.562 --> 44:53.315
-Dogs can't bark-talk.
-[sighs]

44:53.357 --> 44:55.693
Guess I gotta go away
for a little while,

44:55.734 --> 44:57.403
till things settle down.

45:02.825 --> 45:03.867
[sighs]
All right.

45:03.909 --> 45:05.703
I got something for you.
Come on.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.631
[Debbie]
You put me down right now!

45:17.673 --> 45:19.216
Right now!
Put me down!

45:19.258 --> 45:21.552
[grunts]
I just wanna talk to her!

45:21.593 --> 45:22.594
[bouncer] She's not here!

45:22.636 --> 45:23.637
Get the hell out of here.

45:23.679 --> 45:25.889
God!
Fine, fine.

45:25.931 --> 45:28.934
[dance music playing]

45:30.436 --> 45:32.020
Damn it!
Ah!

45:32.062 --> 45:33.105
God fucking--

45:33.147 --> 45:34.690
You do not know
who you're fucking with.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.316
[Franny] Mama?

45:36.358 --> 45:38.652
[sighs] Hi, baby.

45:38.694 --> 45:39.862
Mama's so sorry.

45:39.903 --> 45:41.530
Let's go home, baby.

45:53.959 --> 45:56.420
Been saving this for you.

45:56.462 --> 45:57.212
Whoa.

45:57.254 --> 45:58.839
It's a good training wheel gun.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.966
I mean, you'll need to upgrade
by the time you're 13,

46:01.008 --> 46:02.384
but this'll do for now.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.011
So safety's here.

46:04.052 --> 46:05.971
Clip holds eight,
plus one in the chamber.

46:06.013 --> 46:07.765
Single-action blowback.

46:07.806 --> 46:09.224
Point and shoot,
just like  Call of Duty.

46:09.266 --> 46:11.018
Remember, you gotta keep this
locked up

46:11.059 --> 46:13.604
when you're not using it
so Franny doesn't play with it.

46:13.645 --> 46:15.439
Okay?

46:15.481 --> 46:16.690
I got something to do.

46:16.732 --> 46:17.733
I'll be back in a little bit.

46:17.775 --> 46:20.068
Oh, it's okay if you shoot
a Milkovich.

46:20.110 --> 46:21.653
No one cares.

46:40.923 --> 46:42.090
[Ian] Uh, give me your shirt.

46:42.132 --> 46:44.218
What? No.
I like this shirt.

46:44.259 --> 46:45.761
Ooga booga

46:45.803 --> 46:46.929
Fine.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.311
[Mickey] Uh...

46:55.562 --> 46:56.480
[Ian] Yeah.

46:56.522 --> 46:58.440
Good.

46:58.482 --> 47:00.692
Should we, um,

47:00.734 --> 47:02.611
-say a few words?
-Yeah, "bye."

47:02.653 --> 47:04.112
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

47:07.074 --> 47:09.785
Ooga booga

47:09.827 --> 47:11.328
[Saquon] Nice shoes.
Where'd you get those?

47:11.370 --> 47:12.663
Those are dope.
I like those.

47:12.704 --> 47:13.789
[Carl] Hey, Saquon.

47:13.831 --> 47:14.998
Let me talk to you
for a sec--

47:15.040 --> 47:16.667
[sighs]
Of course.

47:26.093 --> 47:27.344
Dumbass.

47:40.607 --> 47:41.692
[grunts]

47:41.733 --> 47:42.568
Dang.

47:42.609 --> 47:44.903
You are one predictable
little shit, aren't you?

47:44.945 --> 47:46.321
Hey, don't shoot me.

47:46.363 --> 47:50.075
Okay?
I'm actually doing you a favor.

47:50.117 --> 47:52.327
Come here.

47:52.369 --> 47:54.580
Yeah, I used to take
the same route too.

47:54.621 --> 47:57.082
Alley behind the school,
through the dry cleaner's,

47:57.124 --> 47:59.626
then the O'Neils' backyard,
over the St. Agnes wall,

47:59.668 --> 48:02.129
through the gate behind
the Family Dollar to freedom.

48:02.170 --> 48:03.672
Right out
of the South Side playbook.

48:03.714 --> 48:07.175
Now, who do you think took
the lock off this gate, huh?

48:07.217 --> 48:09.219
Am I going to jail?

48:09.261 --> 48:10.888
Look, I'm not
gonna bring you in.

48:10.929 --> 48:12.556
That shit with the machete
was way outta line.

48:12.598 --> 48:15.434
But you gotta get rid of that
gun and also do me a favor.

48:15.475 --> 48:16.310
Like what?

48:16.351 --> 48:17.978
-You know Miss June, right?
-Yeah.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.229
All right,
she's always selling squares

48:19.271 --> 48:21.106
over on Benson
in front of the liquor store.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.567
Make sure no one messes
with her or her friends,

48:23.609 --> 48:25.110
and I'll make sure
no one messes with you.

48:25.152 --> 48:26.445
Deal?

48:26.486 --> 48:27.446
All right.

48:27.487 --> 48:29.448
-[Patrick] Doesn't work?
-[Brad] Mm.

48:29.489 --> 48:30.741
[Patrick]
What about the cloud?

48:30.782 --> 48:32.242
Do you have, like, a cloud link
that you could send us?

48:32.284 --> 48:35.662
[Brad] No, we don't have
anything like that.

48:35.704 --> 48:37.289
Okay, um...

48:38.790 --> 48:40.292
[Lip] Yo!

48:40.334 --> 48:41.376
It's looking like, uh,

48:41.418 --> 48:43.545
Tami and I are buying a house.

48:45.797 --> 48:47.591
What?

48:48.050 --> 48:50.010
I wouldn't.

48:50.385 --> 48:52.137
What are you talking about?

48:52.179 --> 48:54.139
Our new owners, uh,

48:54.181 --> 48:55.557
Patrick and Dante...

48:55.599 --> 48:56.725
[Lip] Yeah.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.269
...are making some changes.

49:01.271 --> 49:03.065
What, uh-what kind of changes?

49:03.106 --> 49:04.900
They're reducing your hours,

49:04.942 --> 49:06.234
everybody's hours,

49:06.276 --> 49:08.070
and they're kicking everybody
down to minimum wage.

49:08.111 --> 49:09.279
Jesus Christ.

49:09.321 --> 49:10.405
This day keeps getting
better and better.

49:10.447 --> 49:12.366
W-what, they want us to quit,
or...

49:12.407 --> 49:14.451
They think they're doing us
a favor.

49:14.493 --> 49:16.119
Apparently
most of the new shops

49:16.161 --> 49:18.789
pay per project,
not by the hour.

49:22.876 --> 49:24.127
I'm gonna talk to them.

49:24.169 --> 49:25.379
Lip, I don't think you should--

49:25.420 --> 49:26.964
Hey, man,
I'm just gonna talk to them.

49:27.005 --> 49:28.674
It's all good.
It's all good.

49:30.008 --> 49:31.843
Hey.

49:31.885 --> 49:33.553
What's up?

49:33.595 --> 49:35.305
[Lip] You're, uh-
you're cutting my hours?

49:35.347 --> 49:38.308
Just a short-term thing till
we can pull in more revenue.

49:38.350 --> 49:40.102
Oh, uh, and you're making us
work for minimum wage, right?

49:40.143 --> 49:41.853
So how about one or the other,
right?

49:41.895 --> 49:44.022
Otherwise,
we're all kind of fucked.

49:44.064 --> 49:45.524
There are plenty of
really good builders out there

49:45.565 --> 49:47.401
who don't have jobs who'd take
that deal in a second.

49:47.442 --> 49:49.277
Oh, there are plenty
of really good builders here,

49:49.319 --> 49:51.196
you know, who've been here
a lot longer than you have,

49:51.238 --> 49:52.990
who work their asses off
every day.

49:53.031 --> 49:55.200
You know, if anything,
they deserve a raise.

49:55.242 --> 49:56.910
You work your ass off?

49:56.952 --> 49:58.203
You've been gone since lunch.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.330
Well, Brad knew where I was.

50:00.372 --> 50:02.124
I was gonna work tonight.

50:02.165 --> 50:03.667
Any other feedback?

50:06.753 --> 50:08.046
No.

50:09.339 --> 50:10.966
Cool, 'cause your ass is fired.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.634
-What the fuck?
-What?

50:12.676 --> 50:14.428
[Patrick] Last thing I need
is some blue-collar bad boy

50:14.469 --> 50:16.888
subjecting me to a bunch
of working-class jibber-jabber.

50:16.930 --> 50:18.765
[Lip] Hmm.

50:19.182 --> 50:20.726
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

50:20.767 --> 50:21.518
Oh, my God. Dude!

50:21.560 --> 50:23.520
-What the fuck, man?
-Fuck you!

50:23.562 --> 50:25.355
[Brad] He's not worth it.
He's not worth it.

50:25.397 --> 50:26.356
He's not worth it.

50:26.398 --> 50:28.025
[Patrick] Fuck!

50:28.775 --> 50:30.068
[Dante] Jesus.

50:31.153 --> 50:33.739
-You okay, man?
-[groans]

50:39.953 --> 50:42.039
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

50:42.080 --> 50:43.915
You went to Ends Meet?

50:43.957 --> 50:45.876
Are you a prostitute?

50:45.917 --> 50:47.544
[scoffs]

50:47.586 --> 50:49.463
-No.
-Are you a stripper?

50:49.504 --> 50:51.715
-No.
-A drug dealer?

50:51.757 --> 50:53.341
I-I mean, not anymore.

50:53.383 --> 50:54.384
What the fuck is this about?

50:54.426 --> 50:55.844
Why are you acting
so crazy?

50:55.886 --> 50:57.095
Why were you at a-a strip bar

50:57.137 --> 50:58.889
and-and a restaurant
and some random

50:58.930 --> 51:00.849
sketchy apartment, huh?

51:01.600 --> 51:03.685
Did you follow me around
all day?

51:03.727 --> 51:04.644
No.
I...

51:04.686 --> 51:06.772
I put Franny's tracker
in your bag.

51:06.813 --> 51:08.398
W...

51:08.440 --> 51:10.275
why would you
fucking do that?

51:10.317 --> 51:11.276
Because this morning

51:11.318 --> 51:12.486
when I found out
that you have a car,

51:12.527 --> 51:14.780
I realized that I don't know
anything about you.

51:14.821 --> 51:16.990
Oh, my fucking God.

51:17.032 --> 51:18.450
You are a psycho.

51:18.492 --> 51:19.993
I mean, what do you do
every day?

51:20.035 --> 51:21.161
Where do you live?

51:21.203 --> 51:22.162
I don't know shit.

51:22.204 --> 51:23.330
I bartend at Ends Meet,

51:23.371 --> 51:24.956
and I drive for Postmates.

51:24.998 --> 51:26.958
That's what I do all day.

51:29.419 --> 51:31.671
You wanna know where I live?

51:32.172 --> 51:34.424
I bounce around
and crash on people's couches,

51:34.466 --> 51:36.968
but I basically live in my car.

51:37.010 --> 51:38.345
Once the virus
shut the city down,

51:38.386 --> 51:39.763
there was no fucking work.

51:39.805 --> 51:40.972
Do you remember that?

51:41.014 --> 51:42.933
I couldn't pay rent.

51:45.352 --> 51:48.480
[sighs]
I-I didn't know.

51:49.481 --> 51:52.651
Yeah, that's 'cause
I didn't want you to know.

51:55.153 --> 51:56.822
I'm sorry.

52:00.700 --> 52:02.786
How are we supposed
to be in a relationship

52:02.828 --> 52:05.247
-if you don't trust me?
-[brakes squealing]

52:05.288 --> 52:07.290
Are we in a relationship?

52:07.332 --> 52:09.584
[person]  Sandy!

52:09.626 --> 52:11.294
-Who's that?
-Sandy!

52:11.336 --> 52:13.046
[sighs]
It's my fucking husband.

52:13.088 --> 52:14.047
Sandy, I know you're in there!

52:14.089 --> 52:15.173
Your what?

52:15.215 --> 52:16.174
-I gotta go.
-What?

52:16.216 --> 52:17.884
I'll-I'll explain
everything later.

52:17.926 --> 52:19.719
Go to fucking hell, Royal!

52:19.761 --> 52:21.179
Sandy,
you just can't run away!

52:21.221 --> 52:22.013
[Sandy] Fuck!

52:22.055 --> 52:25.100
rock music

52:28.103 --> 52:29.813
[Kev] Hey, baby.
How'd it go?

52:29.855 --> 52:31.273
It's damn depressing.

52:31.314 --> 52:32.774
Most of the Black people
are gone.

52:32.816 --> 52:35.152
The ones that are still there
are dumb shits.

52:35.193 --> 52:36.319
How am I supposed
to get out the vote

52:36.361 --> 52:39.239
when most of the vote
has gone to Yorkville?

52:42.367 --> 52:45.287
Hey.
So did you do it?

52:45.328 --> 52:47.998
Do what?

52:48.039 --> 52:49.457
It.

52:49.499 --> 52:51.459
What are you talking about?

52:51.501 --> 52:52.502
Mrs. McCurdy.

52:52.544 --> 52:55.130
You said you were
going to...you know.

52:55.172 --> 52:56.548
I never said that.

52:56.590 --> 52:58.133
What kind of a sick--

52:58.175 --> 53:00.093
...kill her.

53:00.135 --> 53:01.261
Oh, right.

53:01.303 --> 53:03.305
Yes.
Oh, I tried.

53:03.346 --> 53:05.182
-What happened?
-I pulled the plug,

53:05.223 --> 53:06.099
but she didn't die.

53:06.141 --> 53:07.225
In fact, I had to fight her.

53:07.267 --> 53:09.603
The woman
is full of surprises.

53:09.644 --> 53:11.563
Slight build
but Bruce Lee strong.

53:11.605 --> 53:13.440
So, what, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

53:13.481 --> 53:14.983
What do you want me to do,
stab her?

53:15.025 --> 53:16.276
I'm not a monster.

53:16.318 --> 53:17.777
[reporter]  We begin
with tonight's top story.

53:17.819 --> 53:19.905
An impromptu
Unite the Right rally

53:19.946 --> 53:22.574
in Garfield Park results
in dozens of arrests.

53:22.616 --> 53:25.368
[reporter]  When protesters
showed up to stop the rally,

53:25.410 --> 53:28.538
things escalated quickly,
leading to violence...

53:30.207 --> 53:33.293
I am poor...

53:33.335 --> 53:35.921
unemployed, and pretty soon,

53:35.962 --> 53:37.756
I'm gonna be homeless.

53:49.684 --> 53:51.853
How long you been sober for?

53:55.482 --> 53:58.026
About two and a half years.

53:58.068 --> 54:00.070
Almost six months for me.

54:02.489 --> 54:04.407
You know, in the old days,

54:04.449 --> 54:06.284
if that shit had happened,

54:06.326 --> 54:08.161
I'd be at BornFree right now,

54:08.203 --> 54:10.205
stealing everything in sight.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.459
Really?

54:14.501 --> 54:15.627
See, old Lip,

54:15.669 --> 54:17.379
he wasn't
the, uh, upstanding citizen

54:17.420 --> 54:19.089
that he is today.

54:22.300 --> 54:23.468
Well, that's a shame.

54:23.510 --> 54:25.136
You still got the keys?

54:28.974 --> 54:30.308
Yeah.

54:46.408 --> 54:49.327
[dogs barking]

54:57.460 --> 55:00.171
[Milkovich]
Get the fuck out of here!

55:00.213 --> 55:01.715
I'm gonna get you!

55:01.756 --> 55:04.092
-No!
-You hear me?

55:04.134 --> 55:06.011
[dogs barking]

55:06.052 --> 55:08.596
Not today, rednecks!

55:08.638 --> 55:10.598
hip-hop music

55:10.640 --> 55:11.891
They ask me,
"LV, where you been at?"

55:11.933 --> 55:13.518
I been runnin'
through the jungle

55:13.560 --> 55:14.853
It's not safe
to come and get that

55:14.894 --> 55:16.604
Selling trap hits
by the bundle

55:16.646 --> 55:17.897
I know trials
and convictions

55:17.939 --> 55:19.441
That's the lion
of the system

55:19.482 --> 55:20.775
If he lyin',
then we get him

55:20.817 --> 55:22.444
Sellin' classics
like a smuggle...

55:22.485 --> 55:25.405
[Terry groaning]

55:25.447 --> 55:26.823
-Oh!
-[bat clatters]

55:26.865 --> 55:29.075
I gotta piss
like a racehorse.

55:29.117 --> 55:30.660
Fuck your luck,
poppin' 'shrooms

55:30.702 --> 55:33.288
That's Cap'n Crunch
we eat for lunch...

55:33.330 --> 55:34.706
Oh.

55:36.249 --> 55:38.001
[groans]

55:41.713 --> 55:43.340
[bullet squelches]

55:45.759 --> 55:46.926
"LV, where you been at?"

55:46.968 --> 55:48.428
I been runnin'
through the jungle

55:48.470 --> 55:49.679
It's not safe
to come and get that

55:49.721 --> 55:51.014
Selling trap hits
by the bundle

55:51.056 --> 55:52.640
I know trials
and convictions

55:52.682 --> 55:54.476
That's the lion
of the system

55:54.517 --> 55:55.810
If he lyin',
then we get him

55:55.852 --> 55:57.437
Sellin' classics
like a smuggle

55:57.479 --> 55:58.897
They ask me to change,
I stay in my ways

55:58.938 --> 56:01.107
The jungle is searching,
purple is the rain...

56:01.149 --> 56:03.318
[wheezing]

56:03.360 --> 56:05.362
Help.

56:06.446 --> 56:07.655
Help.

56:07.697 --> 56:09.157
Niggas try run our sound

56:09.199 --> 56:10.492
- Hold up

56:10.533 --> 56:11.743
Hold up, nigga, get back

56:11.785 --> 56:13.078
You don't wanna

56:13.119 --> 56:14.788
This a mismatch,
write it in the dispatch

56:14.829 --> 56:16.164
Riding in a pitch-black,

56:16.206 --> 56:17.749
And I'm finna bring

56:23.838 --> 56:25.173
Who you know who got
the flow as me?

56:25.215 --> 56:26.674
Write it down
and scratch it out for me

56:29.594 --> 56:30.970
Popping shit

56:31.012 --> 56:32.472
Watch my wrist,
the time is on the dial

56:32.514 --> 56:33.932
Papa said,
"Don't ever go to trial"

56:33.973 --> 56:35.308
It's a lot of motherfuckers
who won't see me now

56:35.350 --> 56:36.726

Life is a bitch,
