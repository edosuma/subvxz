<i>Do you remember the first time
your husband saw you naked?</i>

01:07.640 --> 01:09.210
<i>Do you remember
what it felt like?</i>

01:10.560 --> 01:12.085
<i>Do you remember
what he felt like?</i>

01:12.160 --> 01:14.891
Holy motherfuckin' fuck!
Oh, my God!

01:14.960 --> 01:17.008
Holy fuck!
Oh, my God!

01:19.000 --> 01:21.002
Wow!

01:22.320 --> 01:24.129
Again?
Fuck, yeah.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.889
<i>Now, this might
be</i> a <i>little harder.</i>

01:26.960 --> 01:29.611
<i>Do you remember the second time
your husband saw you naked?</i>

01:31.000 --> 01:32.525
Annie, you coming?

01:32.800 --> 01:34.529
We're gonna be late.
Wake up, sleepyhead!

01:34.600 --> 01:36.250
Annie!
Shit.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.330
Hey, guys.
I, uh, totally overslept.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.281
- Um, okay. Well, you can meet us.
- Okay. That sounds...

01:50.880 --> 01:52.644
I saw your butt.
Just standin' there.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.881
Did you?

01:53.960 --> 01:55.883
I never seen
your butt before.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.530
I had no choice.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.248
<i>We accidentally
left the door open.</i>

02:00.720 --> 02:02.643
<i>I mean, can you even
imagine a world</i>

02:02.720 --> 02:04.722
<i>where you accidentally
leave the door open?</i>

02:16.400 --> 02:17.890
I love fucking you.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.849
I fucking love you.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.411
For Jay and I,

02:25.480 --> 02:26.720
<i>the next few months
were a blur</i>

02:26.800 --> 02:31.249
<i>of constant naked,
sweaty, ugly, amazing sex.</i>

02:35.240 --> 02:36.287
Okay. I got it.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.925
On, God!

02:38.360 --> 02:39.885
I'll probably be pretty
hungry after this.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.320
It's been a while
since I've eaten.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.805
I can make you
a sandwich.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.644
We could probably make a burrito
out of shit we have here.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.721
Okay-

02:48.920 --> 02:51.810
Oh, no!

02:51.880 --> 02:54.008
Holy Mary,
mother of...

02:54.080 --> 02:56.287
<i>And let's face it.</i>

02:56.560 --> 02:57.800
<i>The erections.</i>

02:57.880 --> 02:59.882
<i>Oh, God. Do you remember
the erections?</i>

02:59.960 --> 03:01.962
<i>Erections everywhere.</i>

03:02.440 --> 03:04.408
<i>If the Wind blew.</i>

03:06.360 --> 03:08.601
<i>If he ate certain foods.</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:13.767
<i>If he watched any movie.</i>

03:16.680 --> 03:18.682
<i>If he got sleepy.</i>

03:19.560 --> 03:20.971
<i>If he woke up.</i>

03:21.200 --> 03:22.201
Good morning.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.725
<i>Sometimes,
I swear his erection</i>

03:23.800 --> 03:26.041
<i>knew I was in the area
before Jay did.</i>

03:26.120 --> 03:27.121
Annie?

03:29.800 --> 03:32.280
<i>Everywhere we went,
everything we did,</i>

03:32.360 --> 03:34.761
<i>was another opportunity
to have sex.</i>

03:35.240 --> 03:37.208
Do you think we should be
doing this right here?

03:37.320 --> 03:39.800
Baby, honestly,
I don't think anyone

03:39.880 --> 03:41.291
can tell what's happening.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.964
<i>It's not that
it was just sex.</i>

03:45.040 --> 03:46.610
<i>But we knew that
there was always</i>

03:46.680 --> 03:48.489
<i>more sex just around
the corner.</i>

03:51.440 --> 03:53.442
<i>Then, it happened.</i>

03:55.160 --> 03:56.366
Dad.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.487
Mom.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.322
Jay and I
have some big news.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.520
We're in love. We're pregnant
and we're getting married.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.571
Come again?
Honey, wait. What?

04:06.320 --> 04:07.367
Are you sure?

04:07.440 --> 04:08.601
Yeah. I took the test
three times.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
No, honey. No, I mean,

04:09.720 --> 04:11.370
are you sure that now
is the right time?

04:12.040 --> 04:14.168
You're both very,
very young

04:14.240 --> 04:16.129
and who knows what
the future holds?

04:16.640 --> 04:18.130
Uh, Greg?

04:18.760 --> 04:20.046
Oh. Jay.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.845
Yeah. Where are you
from again?

04:23.800 --> 04:25.290
Mr. and Mrs. Grovner, uh,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.044
I know that we just met.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.761
But when I first met Annie,

04:29.840 --> 04:31.285
I knew that she was the one.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.761
And so I think,
once you get to know me,

04:33.840 --> 04:34.841
you're gonna feel

04:34.960 --> 04:38.203
a lot better about this
moment than you do right now

04:40.120 --> 04:41.610
because I really love
your daughter.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.727
I love you.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.324
Oh, boy.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.330
Well, goodbye, sex.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.726
Dad!
Walt.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.609
What?
What?

04:58.400 --> 04:59.640
They're not right,
are they?

04:59.720 --> 05:01.563
No, of course not.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.085
I don't think.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.401
We're not too young?

05:04.480 --> 05:06.323
Oh, we're young.
You know?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.562
But we definitely
know each other.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.726
Greg, right?

05:10.880 --> 05:12.405
Yes, I'm Greg.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.600
Look, here's what I think.

05:13.640 --> 05:14.721
They're right.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.167
We don't know
what the future holds.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.089
But I also think that whatever
the world throws at us,

05:22.080 --> 05:23.923
let's deal with it, right?

05:24.040 --> 05:25.041
Yeah.
You know?

05:25.120 --> 05:26.804
But what about the sex part?

05:26.880 --> 05:29.008
Are you still gonna
wanna have sex with me

05:29.080 --> 05:31.128
even when I am big
and fat and pregnant,

05:31.200 --> 05:33.009
and then later when
I'm somebody's mother?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.206
Yeah!

05:34.280 --> 05:35.645
Yeah.
Really?

05:35.720 --> 05:36.846
Babe, my dick
can see the future.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.280
That's why we call it
Nostracockus.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.369
What about you? Are you gonna
wanna have sex with me?

05:42.440 --> 05:43.960
Yes, I'm gonna wanna
have sex with you.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.001
Yeah?
Yes!

05:45.080 --> 05:47.040
Do you know why I'm gonna
wanna have sex with you?

05:47.520 --> 05:49.761
My butt?
Because of your butt, babe.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.762
<i>We promised ourselves
nothing would change.</i>

05:53.840 --> 05:55.285
<i>That we wouldn't let it.</i>

05:55.600 --> 05:57.204
<i>And even though
it was awkward sometimes,</i>

05:57.280 --> 05:58.770
<i>we made it work.</i>

05:58.840 --> 05:59.966
If you could just turn
a little bit more

06:00.080 --> 06:01.161
Yep.
To the right.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.730
I think we're good.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.567
That's... I'm maxed out.
My stomach's in the way.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.846
You know what?
I'm gonna grab boob.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.046
Yeah, just be careful.
They're really sensitive.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.281
And not in a good way.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.407
Got it. Very gently
grabbin' boob.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.480
Okay, gently.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.046
And here comes the penis.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.327
That's gonna be
the name of my album.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.210
<i>We were determined.
And often, successful.</i>

06:19.280 --> 06:21.806
<i>Then came the event.</i>

06:21.880 --> 06:24.121
Motherfucker!

06:24.200 --> 06:26.487
You're doing an amazing job, babe.
You're doing great!

06:26.560 --> 06:27.686
Tell her
she's doing great!

06:27.760 --> 06:29.160
He's crowning,
if you'd like to see.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.486
Yeah.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.320
Wow!

06:36.800 --> 06:41.089
That is one
incredibly versatile hole.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.850
You're tellin' me.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.651
<i>From that moment on,
everything was completely different.</i>

06:46.760 --> 06:47.921
<i>No two ways about it.</i>

06:49.840 --> 06:51.001
Oh, I'll be back.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.650
<i>Not that
we didn't try.</i>

06:54.840 --> 06:56.046
Got it.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.963
<i>And if one
made it difficult,</i>

06:58.040 --> 06:59.929
<i>two made it
almost impossible.</i>

07:00.520 --> 07:01.806
Honey,

07:02.080 --> 07:04.526
let's try to have
sex next weekend

07:04.600 --> 07:07.729
when my mom comes
over for lunch, okay?

07:07.840 --> 07:10.366
I'm gonna do you
like a fucking...

07:14.440 --> 07:17.364
<i>Now, do you
remember the last time</i>

07:17.440 --> 07:19.169
<i>your husband saw you naked?</i>

07:19.240 --> 07:20.765
- Jay.
- Yeah.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.160
I need a little help here.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.611
I may be late for my thing
if I don't get in here

07:23.680 --> 07:25.680
and take a shower right away.
Can we switch places?

07:31.360 --> 07:33.044
<i>You know,
don't even think about it.</i>

07:33.120 --> 07:37.648
<i>The big question is, how the
hell do you get it back?</i>

07:47.680 --> 07:49.603
All right, guys!
Let's get goin'!

07:49.680 --> 07:51.762
Clive, if you wanna wear your
uniform, you gotta get changed, bud.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.808
Uh, one minute.
This is really important.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.120
What are you workin' on?

07:55.200 --> 07:56.770
It's my video
yearbook presentation

07:56.840 --> 07:58.330
for graduation on Monday.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.084
That is super
impressive, man.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.961
Where'd you learn how to do that?
It's really easy, Dad.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.040
Hey, save it as something

08:04.080 --> 08:05.570
other than "Video 1"
for me, will ya?

08:05.640 --> 08:07.529
It's fine. It's Video 1.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.284
Hey, Clive. I asked you
to do something, right?

08:09.400 --> 08:10.640
Don't condescend to me.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.800
It's time to go to school.
I'll meet you in the car.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.766
Nell, are you ready?

08:16.320 --> 08:17.321
Later.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.001
All right, gang!
Let's go!

08:19.080 --> 08:20.127
Wait, honey. Hold on!

08:20.600 --> 08:21.761
I'm going!

08:21.840 --> 08:23.365
I'm going, too!

08:23.480 --> 08:26.484
Mommy packed me two kinds of sandwiches.
Jelly and peanut butter.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.244
Oh, yes, honey.
Wow.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.681
Bye, honey. Good
luck with your game.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.808
Good luck at work!
Thanks, baby.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.245
Clive, buckle up
your sister, will ya?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.203
Honey, did you pack all of her stuff?
Yeah, yeah, of course.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.725
Don't forget to
stop by and grab...

08:37.799 --> 08:40.485
Light bulbs.
I am on top of it. Hey.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.126
It's gonna go great.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.531
God, is this actually
happening?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.443
Am I gonna sell the blog for money?
Like, real money?

08:46.560 --> 08:47.561
Is that possible?

08:47.640 --> 08:49.040
It would be amazing.
For everything.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.809
Dad,
I can't be late again!

08:50.880 --> 08:52.882
- Yes! I'll be right there, guys!
- Let's go!

08:52.960 --> 08:54.803
Yes, Clive! I heard...

08:55.800 --> 08:58.451
Is it just me or is the big
one becoming kind of a dick?

08:58.840 --> 09:00.171
Don't say that.
Seriously, babe.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.368
No, I'm just sayin'
he's acting like a dick.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.566
Don't say that.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.564
Hey, we should have
sex sometime soon.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.569
Oh, I would love that.
Yeah, me, too.

09:07.800 --> 09:08.800
Maybe Thursday.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.842
Fantastic. 'Cause it feels
like it's been a long time.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.126
- It has, right?
- Yeah.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.961
The last time was when we got those
towels from Bed Bath & Beyond.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.809
Oh, that's right. That was a while ago.
Yeah, the linen sale.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.480
Look, we can't talk
about this right now,

09:18.520 --> 09:19.726
because we both
have someplace to be.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.200
Not the right time.
Gotta get goin'.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.890
It's just been so hard to find
the moment with the kids.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.769
At the end of the day, we're
just both so exhausted.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.240
You know? Oh, just
tell me about it.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.770
Maybe one of these nights,
we'll have sex

09:27.840 --> 09:29.365
<i>instead of watching
Project Runway.</i>

09:29.480 --> 09:31.005
We'll TiVo <i>Project Runway.</i>

09:31.160 --> 09:32.605
That's probably why
they invented TiVo.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.011
So people could have sex.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.120
Daddy?
I still don't get it.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.931
Why do we keep having
all of these days?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.321
And then,
going to bed at night?

09:43.400 --> 09:46.085
And then, having
all of these days?

09:46.160 --> 09:48.322
And then, going to bed
at night?

09:48.920 --> 09:51.844
Well, uh, that's
sort of what life is.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.969
When will it end?

09:55.280 --> 09:56.281
It won't.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.606
Well, it'll end
when we die.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.806
Don't do that, buddy.
Okay?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.368
Won't I get bored
of doing this stuff

10:01.440 --> 10:03.920
again and again and again?

10:04.040 --> 10:05.121
No.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.690
But you and Mommy
are bored.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.202
Well, that's what
happens with marriage.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.281
Who are you?

10:14.640 --> 10:17.291
Dad,
Nell's doing it again.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.728
Hey. Nell, get your finger
out of your butt.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.203
Is anyone gonna
clean her finger?

10:24.720 --> 10:26.290
Hey! Stop! No!

10:26.360 --> 10:27.600
- Nell!
- No. stop.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.847
Do you mind if I join you?

10:28.920 --> 10:29.921
I don't mind!

10:30.000 --> 10:31.729
No! Stop. Stop!

10:32.200 --> 10:34.567
As you know, Piper Brothers
is the world's number one

10:34.640 --> 10:36.404
toy and child
product brand

10:36.480 --> 10:37.970
in the zero-to-four
age range

10:38.040 --> 10:39.644
for over 50 years.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.961
We're looking to bring Piper
Brothers into the future.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.769
And a big part of
that is developing

10:43.840 --> 10:45.604
the Piper Brothers
online community

10:45.680 --> 10:48.081
in a way that's befitting
of the Piper Brothers name.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.571
But also in a way that says,

10:49.640 --> 10:51.520
"This is not your grandfather's
Piper Brothers."

10:51.920 --> 10:54.082
But in order for us
to do that, we need content.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.242
Hey, everybody! Annie!

10:56.520 --> 10:57.646
Hi.
Hank Rosenbaum.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.762
Such a pleasure.
Thank you so much.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.683
I've heard so much
about you.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.171
Please, sit down.
Thank you.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.004
Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Finger sandwich?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.804
Sliced pineapple?

11:07.280 --> 11:09.282
No, no. I'm fine with just water.
Thanks.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.491
Oh, well, I just wanna stick
my head in and say hi

11:12.560 --> 11:14.562
and to tell you that I'm a
big fan of what you do.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.688
Thanks. That's really
nice to hear.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.091
We think you have
brand potential.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.565
The model
Piper Brothers mother.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.840
We really
believe in you.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.365
And I always say
that belief

11:22.440 --> 11:23.680
is the only metric
that matters.

11:24.440 --> 11:27.205
We didn't bring you here to wow
you with incredible numbers

11:27.280 --> 11:29.044
because numbers
are really just

11:29.120 --> 11:31.600
an algorithm for
passion and values.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.648
It's like I was
telling my wife, Schlomit,

11:33.720 --> 11:37.247
I think I found the voice
of Piper Brothers' values.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.408
Yeesh!

11:40.880 --> 11:41.881
Thanks!

11:42.040 --> 11:43.166
Are you sure
we can't get you

11:43.240 --> 11:44.890
a finger sandwich
or a slice of pineapple?

11:47.560 --> 11:48.800
I'm okay.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.804
There are certain content
guidelines we'd like to discuss.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.804
Oh, how do you mean?
Little things.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.484
"Do you remember
the first time

11:55.560 --> 11:57.085
"your husband
saw you naked?"

11:57.160 --> 11:58.207
Right, um...

11:58.320 --> 12:01.005
"The erections? Do you
remember the erections?"

12:01.160 --> 12:02.571
No, I remember that part.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.801
"Erections everywhere."

12:04.000 --> 12:05.570
That's an unusual
post for me.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.563
It's a great post.
I enjoyed it.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.608
But what we're looking
for from you

12:09.720 --> 12:12.803
is your authentic,
wholesome voice.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.211
It's the kind of content
that Piper Brothers

12:14.280 --> 12:15.486
mothers are so hungry for.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.722
Look, I love
being a mother.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.524
And I love writing
about it.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.368
Well, we will make you
a meaningful proposal.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.771
And we're very excited.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.326
Should we have
some pineapple?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.687
We can have someone
get you some pineapple.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.207
<i>Band's coming to the
Los Angeles area tomorrow.</i>

12:33.280 --> 12:35.965
<i>Meantime, here's the new single.
It's called Spank Me.</i>

12:36.160 --> 12:38.128
I swear to you, man.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.964
I think I am in love
with this girl.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.605
Max, that's big news.
Yeah.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.091
It's, like, we...

12:43.160 --> 12:44.889
I don't know.
We just connect.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.530
Like, we have these
really long, like,

12:46.600 --> 12:49.444
super intense
conversations. You know?

12:49.520 --> 12:52.683
About religion,
and snowboarding.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.247
And then, like,
out of nowhere,

12:55.320 --> 12:57.721
she'll just text me
her boobs.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.360
She just texted you a picture
of her boobs out of the blue?

13:01.720 --> 13:03.324
Oh, buddy. Good for you.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.608
Enjoy this time.
Thank you, dude.

13:05.720 --> 13:06.846
That's amazing.
Yeah.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.763
I once sent Annie
a picture of my dick.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.411
She was at a PTA meeting.
It was horrible.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Did you go full dick?

13:13.040 --> 13:14.166
Yeah. I...

13:14.360 --> 13:15.361
Oh.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.000
For a man, I feel like
it's dick or...

13:17.040 --> 13:18.485
That's kind of
your only option.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.641
Yeah, I avoid my dick.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.449
I usually just do, like,

13:21.520 --> 13:22.885
you know, the sexier
parts of me.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.843
Um, like, part bag,
part leg.

13:25.920 --> 13:26.967
You know?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.849
I'll go undercarriage.
So...

13:28.960 --> 13:30.166
I'll have my friend,
Doug, come over

13:30.240 --> 13:31.571
and we'll just
knock it out real fast.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.484
Your friend comes over and
takes a picture of your balls?

13:34.560 --> 13:36.085
Yeah. Yeah.
You know Doug, right?

13:36.200 --> 13:37.690
Your neighbor?
Yeah.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.489
He's actually a really
good photographer.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.607
He works from home.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.681
- And, so...
- Hey, guys.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.250
Hey, Rosie.
Hello, Rosie.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.407
New iPads are here.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.767
Ah, thank you. I have
been waiting for these.

13:46.840 --> 13:47.921
How many of those
things do you have?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.001
Two at a time.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.003
One for new music.
One for back catalogue.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.731
I have this complicated syncing
system, but it works out.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.400
Well, what do you do with the old ones?
I just give 'em as gifts.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.048
Hey, babe. How'd it go?
They wanna buy it!

14:01.120 --> 14:03.566
That's amazing! What did they say?
Did they make an offer?

14:03.640 --> 14:04.687
They're going to.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.001
They said it would be "meaningful."
Whatever that means.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.208
I think that means
a lot of money.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.725
<i>- Right?</i>
- <i>I</i> know!

14:10.800 --> 14:12.086
Well, we have to celebrate.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.840
Slow down. They haven't
made the offer yet.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.048
They're going to. And
that's reason to celebrate.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.849
I can get Sam to cover me tonight.
What do you wanna do?

14:17.960 --> 14:20.042
I don't know. Should we take
the kids somewhere fun?

14:20.120 --> 14:21.800
Like pizza and roller
skating or something?

14:23.400 --> 14:24.811
Totally! I can't wait.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.450
I'll see you
in a couple hours.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.762
Okay, hon. Love you.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.122
- Hello?
<i>- Hey,</i> Mom.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.486
What's wrong, honey?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.404
Nothing's wrong.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.324
What are you
doing tonight?

14:50.800 --> 14:52.040
All right,

14:52.160 --> 14:54.481
who's ready for some
roller skating?

14:55.320 --> 14:56.560
Annie?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.482
Clive? Nelly?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.925
Annie, you here?

15:06.320 --> 15:08.084
All right.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.165
Hello.

15:16.960 --> 15:17.961
Hey-

15:18.120 --> 15:19.167
Hey, babe.
Hi.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.480
Where are the kids?

15:20.520 --> 15:21.851
They're at my mom's.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.763
Oh, they are? I thought that we
were gonna go down to the...

15:23.840 --> 15:26.161
Whoa, holy shit! Wow!

15:26.680 --> 15:28.682
Hi.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.241
Wow. Look at you.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.443
Too much?
No, it's great.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.686
I was thinking...

15:33.840 --> 15:36.002
Yeah! Yes!

15:36.480 --> 15:37.970
The kids, um,
how long are they...

15:38.080 --> 15:39.127
They're sleepin' over.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.201
Yes!

15:40.840 --> 15:42.604
'Cause I was thinking that...
Whoa.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.209
Maybe we could celebrate,
just the two of us.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.681
I get it.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.484
That's a great idea.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.961
This is, like, the best
idea you've ever had.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.724
You look amazing.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.803
Do you own these underwear?
Mm-hmm.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.450
'Cause I've never
seen those before.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.560
Come on.

15:59.600 --> 16:03.002
This is so exciting.
I'm so excited right now.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.481
And now you're
on the bed.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.722
This is great.
I love where this is headed.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.849
Your narrating,
it's so hot.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.570
She said, encouragingly.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.730
Get over here and take these
roller skates off of me.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.161
I love it when you talk that
way about your roller skates.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.881
Double knot.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.920
Okay-

16:39.240 --> 16:40.240
Here, maybe...

16:40.280 --> 16:41.645
No, no, no, I got it.
Okay.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.442
Ooh.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.848
Okay, that should do it.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.528
And a-one...
Uh-huh.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.964
Ow!

16:58.040 --> 16:59.246
Fuck! Ow.
Ow!

17:02.400 --> 17:04.971
That got a lot less hot
real quick, didn't it?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.281
Mmm.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.810
Mm-hmm?
Mm-hmm.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.088
Mm-hmm.
Should we continue?

17:22.160 --> 17:23.400
Yes.
Mm.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.040
Mm! Oop...

17:27.119 --> 17:28.724
Babe. That was like...
Toothy.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.848
Okay, just relax.
Do I not seem relaxed?

17:30.920 --> 17:32.445
No, I mean both of us.
What I'm talking about.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.721
Oh. We'll both relax.
We'll just relax.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.926
If we both relaxed,
it'd be good.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.331
Just...

17:49.760 --> 17:51.330
Sorry. I'm sorry.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.408
What is happening with us right now?
I don't know.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.891
I just got
in my head a little bit.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.729
It was just weird for a second.
I'm sorry. Okay, it's fine.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.325
Here's what we're gonna do.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.765
All right.
Here we go.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.490
Let's do this thing.
It's on.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.841
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

18:08.920 --> 18:09.921
Oh.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.843
What?
We have hit boob.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.162
We've got
a man on second base.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.523
It's a baseball term but it
also means touching your boob.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.762
I know what it means.
Why don't we go to third.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.521
Whoa.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.207
What?
Hmm?

18:29.680 --> 18:30.681
What?

18:31.040 --> 18:32.690
Too much in my own head.

18:32.880 --> 18:33.880
I think I've been
dreaming

18:33.960 --> 18:35.086
about this moment
for so long Mm-hmm.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.362
When we could, like,
drop everything Yeah.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.006
And just properly schtup.
Right, right.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.162
Instead of when
you're like, half conscious

18:42.240 --> 18:43.685
and can't resist,
you know?

18:43.760 --> 18:45.125
You think I wanna resist?

18:45.200 --> 18:47.123
Of course I know
that you wanna have sex.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.283
Sometimes I just wonder if you
wanna have sex that much.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.045
I do. I do wanna
have sex that much.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.884
But sometimes
I just feel like

18:54.960 --> 18:56.962
you know, you're tired
or you're stressed out.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.041
And maybe...
Me?

18:58.120 --> 18:59.121
I don't know,
I wonder sometimes

18:59.240 --> 19:00.810
if you're still, you know,
attracted to me.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.167
Are you kidding?
You're a fuckin' sexpot.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.486
You think I'm a sexpot?

19:04.560 --> 19:05.721
Instant boner.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.165
That's what I always
say about you.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.166
My wife, instant
boner-giver.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.329
Tell me more about
this boner of yours.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.562
He's a good guy.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.642
Proud. Strong.
Ooh.

19:18.760 --> 19:19.807
Great sense
of humor.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.170
Let's go fuck on
the kitchen floor.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.600
There he is.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.761
You comin'?

19:41.120 --> 19:43.009
I'm so glad
that I mopped yesterday.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.206
Yeah, totally.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.762
Honey?
Babe, babe, honey.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.640
Do you wanna go
somewhere else?

19:50.680 --> 19:52.967
Oh, my God, thank God
you said something.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.570
My knees hurt, like, really bad.
Oh, God.

19:54.640 --> 19:55.721
They really hurt.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.365
I know. My tailbone
is killing me

19:57.440 --> 19:58.726
and I can see
my to-do list.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.290
Should we try the couch?
Yeah.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.200
- Sex on the couch, of course, yeah.
- Let's go.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.241
Let's go.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.089
It'll just be a minute.
Okay.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.124
<i>Oh .</i>

20:23.640 --> 20:25.165
No.
No?

20:31.080 --> 20:32.127
Do you have allergies?

20:32.280 --> 20:34.248
Yeah, all week. I've had
allergies all week.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.806
It's 'cause of the pressure change.
Oh, is that what it is?

20:40.400 --> 20:41.401
Mmm.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.688
This used to totally work, remember?
Totally work.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.881
This was like my move.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.530
You loved this.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.770
Shit, man!

21:02.840 --> 21:04.330
What is happening?
It's okay.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.765
Is it possible that
we have somehow

21:05.840 --> 21:06.966
forgotten how to have sex?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.207
Do not say that. Because we
used to be great at this.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.611
Yeah, we were. We were.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.330
I was like Shaquille O'Neal
in the sack.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.526
I had that kind of game.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.648
What? Shaquille O'Neal's
a weird comparison.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.843
I'm just trying to say that I was
a dominant player. Yeah, I know.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.962
I would've gone with Derek Fisher for you.
Derek Fisher?

21:22.080 --> 21:23.969
What? He's a great player. Okay.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.889
I feel like we're tryin' to
say the same thing. Okay.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.042
You were like LeBron James.
Oh, thanks, honey.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.408
We were like Derek Fisher
and LeBron James having sex.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.846
I'm saying we were
world-class.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.684
And now,
what is happening?

21:37.080 --> 21:40.050
I don't know.
I mean, we're older.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.481
We're parents.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.925
Yeah, but we're not dead!

21:44.240 --> 21:46.288
I still think about
sex all the time.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.880
I know.
I use your computer.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.083
Oh, the porn.
Yeah.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.562
You and I used to watch
porn together all the time.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.404
I still watch porn
every once in a while.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.806
You do?
Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.480
But the quality of writing
has really gone downhill.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.246
I like it best when it feels
like they're really in love.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.448
Yeah, I feel like we're getting
different things out of porn.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.520
Maybe.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.961
I just watch it for the
naked women having sex.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.121
And the porn guys

22:09.200 --> 22:10.645
don't get in the way
or anything?

22:11.160 --> 22:12.685
Don't even see 'em.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.728
They're completely
invisible to me.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.090
Should we watch
some porn?

22:17.640 --> 22:18.766
Eh.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.484
Just feels
kind of depressing.

22:21.560 --> 22:22.607
Yeah.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.684
Do we have any
of that tequila left?

22:26.040 --> 22:29.010
That's a good idea. That's a
really good idea. JAY: Right.

22:29.080 --> 22:30.366
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.647
We are gonna drink some tequila.
Whoo!

22:32.720 --> 22:33.767
We're gonna
pull ourselves

22:33.840 --> 22:35.171
out of this
sad little moment

22:35.240 --> 22:36.685
that we're having
and after that...

22:36.760 --> 22:40.446
We're gonna be Derek Fisher
and LeBron fucking James.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.885
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.325
I'm gonna call my mom
and make sure

22:43.400 --> 22:44.970
the kids went to sleep okay.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.562

Hey-

22:57.800 --> 22:58.801
Hey-

22:59.280 --> 23:00.964
Oh, yeah.
I just got that today.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.405
I'm super excited about it.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.562
It's got a higher-resolution
display,

23:04.640 --> 23:05.721
which means more pixels,

23:06.080 --> 23:07.764
and they upgraded the camera.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.963
What?
I just had this idea.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.969
Oh, all right.
Let's hear it.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.325
Let's make a porn.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.321
Excuse me?

23:19.720 --> 23:23.008
Let's video ourselves
having sex.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.401
Absolutely. Yeah, totally.
Really?

23:30.560 --> 23:33.564
Yeah. The more I think about
it, yes, that's a great idea.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.284
I think it's kind
of hot, right?

23:35.360 --> 23:37.681
Babe, I think that
is a great idea.

23:37.760 --> 23:38.841
Here, cheers.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.251
Look at us.
Annie and Jay.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.446
Send the kids off
to Grandma's house,

23:41.520 --> 23:43.204
make a little porn.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.770
 Mazel tov.
To porn.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.921
Chug it.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.001
I mean, drink to that.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.006
Oh, yeah.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.407
We don't even have to watch
it if we don't want to.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.130
Or we could.
Either way.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.045
Okay, honey,

24:02.120 --> 24:03.406
what's our storyline?

24:03.480 --> 24:04.527
Story?
Yeah.

24:04.560 --> 24:05.766
I'm not sure the story's
that important. Yeah.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.961
Oh, come on.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.365
I have another idea.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.764
Well, I would like
to hear that idea.

24:11.840 --> 24:12.966
Because you're clearly
in the zone.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.087
This is it.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.889
This is what
we're gonna do.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.291
<i>The Joy of Sex.</i>

24:17.360 --> 24:18.361
We still have that.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.090
Every position, right now.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.242
Oh, I like that.
I like that a lot.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.321
Every single one?

24:23.440 --> 24:24.726
Yep. We're not
gonna skip one.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.130
<i>Even, uh...
Yeah. Even that.</i>

24:27.200 --> 24:28.929
Yes!
But also...

24:29.640 --> 24:31.244
Totally. It's in the book.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.402
Yay! And we'll video
the whole thing.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.562
You're a genius.
No, I married a genius.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.565
I need
another drink.

24:37.640 --> 24:38.880
I need to be drunker.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.565
Okay-

24:40.640 --> 24:42.085
- Here I go.
- Get here. Okay.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.920
Action.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.481
Hello.
Hi.

24:52.640 --> 24:56.042
And welcome to
Annie and Jay's,

24:56.160 --> 24:57.844
<i>A Night With
Annie and Jay.</i>

24:57.920 --> 25:00.161
I'm Jay and this is
my lovely wife, Annie.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.240
And tonight,

25:01.280 --> 25:03.931
we intend to demonstrate
every position

25:04.600 --> 25:05.840
<i>in The Joy of Sex.</i>

25:06.000 --> 25:07.923
Are you speaking
to our students, honey?

25:08.120 --> 25:10.088
Why, yes, l am, Annie.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.210
And this is our dojo.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.600
Our sex dojo.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.170
Our sex dojo.
That's right.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.924
Annie, the book, please.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.770
Here you go, Professor.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.126
Thank you, Annie.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.167
Well.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.529
Wow. Wow. Okay.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.125
Look at that bush.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.201
Well, look at his bush.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.566
I'm talking about his bush.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.244
Is that still his bush?

25:32.800 --> 25:36.009
I can't tell where her
bush ends and his begins.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.242
People were furrier
in the '70s.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.121
Oh.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.127
"Matrimonial." Mm-hmm.
That's right. Wow. Hmm.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.645
Matrimonial.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.201
Can we start with something
other than missionary?

25:48.280 --> 25:51.648
Absolutely. We can loop
back around to missionary.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.524
Right. It's not goin' anywhere.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.001
Okay, close your eyes,
my dear.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.482
Say "stop" when I...
Stop!

26:00.560 --> 26:01.641
"Flanquette."

26:01.880 --> 26:03.484
Flanquette!
Oh.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.609
That is what
I'm talkin' about.

26:05.720 --> 26:06.801
I feel good about this one.
Me, too.

26:06.880 --> 26:07.927
Okay. So you see
what's happening?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.240
That's my leg.
Yeah, okay.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.209
But that's your leg.
Okay.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.281
So, it's like...

26:12.360 --> 26:13.360
Yep. All right.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.090
Let's do this. Let's do it.
Let's do it.

26:20.800 --> 26:21.801
<i>What?</i>

26:22.240 --> 26:24.607
- Come here. Come here.
<i>- Okay,</i> here we go.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.925
<i>Hi.
Hi.</i>

26:30.160 --> 26:31.605
<i>Okay, ready? Okay.
Yeah.</i>

26:31.680 --> 26:32.681
<i>Go.
Go.</i>

26:40.000 --> 26:41.764
You're amazing at that.

26:41.840 --> 26:42.841
Really?

26:42.920 --> 26:44.445
Oh, my gosh.
Still?

26:44.520 --> 26:45.726
Are you kidding me?

26:45.800 --> 26:47.848
You were like a machine.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.202
Like a battering ram.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.681
Thank you.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.204
Honey?
Yeah?

26:54.360 --> 26:56.647
Erase that video, okay?

26:57.480 --> 26:58.480
Yeah.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.807
I don't want the kids to ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever...

27:00.880 --> 27:02.450
No, I'll erase it.
No worries.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.045
You don't forget, okay?

27:04.120 --> 27:05.565
I won't forget.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.162
I love fucking you.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.889
I fucking love you.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.564
No! No,
not my own son!

27:30.760 --> 27:31.841
Whoops!

27:42.400 --> 27:44.004
So as long as we
get them both down

27:44.080 --> 27:45.844
<i>for thew second naps
by 2:00 - ish,</i>

27:45.920 --> 27:47.843
then the nighttime
is a little better.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.969
Yeah, if we don't get them down
by 2:00-ish we're totally fucked.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.242
Wow. "Totally fucked."
That's nice.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.731
This is just
an expression.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.006
How else would
you describe this?

27:56.080 --> 27:57.206
I would describe
this as...

27:57.240 --> 27:58.810
Super fucked? ...a gift of life.
You're welcome.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.484
You guys are bouncing the
shit out of those babies.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.005
You're bouncing 'em hard.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.286
Oh, you guys
are doing great.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.850
It's getting
a lot easier, though.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.843
Oh, we're seeing the light
at the end of the tunnel.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.611
Yeah. You guys should
have seen us a month ago.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.205
I don't even know
who I was then.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.203
Oh, my God.
These are the salad days.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.124
Yeah, it sounds really
intense, but you got it!

28:16.200 --> 28:17.611
So, are you guys
thinking of having more?

28:17.680 --> 28:18.806
No.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.010
Isn't it crazy
that the boys

28:21.080 --> 28:24.209
are graduating fourth grade?
Isn't that crazy?

28:24.280 --> 28:27.124
And Howard is graduating fifth grade.
When did that happen?

28:27.200 --> 28:29.726
Since when did kids graduate
from fourth and fifth grade?

28:29.800 --> 28:32.007
It used to be
school just ended.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.730
There wasn't a ceremony
for everything.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.040
Just...
Ignore him.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.565
- I will.
- Yeah.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.165
I love your blog, by the way.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.730
Oh, thank you.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.723
Hey, do you think Piper
Brothers is gonna go for it?

28:41.800 --> 28:43.802
Fingers crossed.
Yes.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.564
Hey. good people.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.640
Hi, honey. Hi.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.727
Hello, you. Hi.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.125
You're really wet.
Look at you.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.840
Yeah. I should go put
on some dry clothes.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.168
Oh, um, I'm gonna,
uh, come with you

28:56.240 --> 28:58.322
'cause we gotta talk
about that... About, uh...

28:58.560 --> 28:59.721
The thing.
Yes, the thing.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.842
Totally. We have to
talk about a thing.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.007
Thank you.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.208
Jesus. Kill me.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.682
Hey. Hello, pal.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.411
Gentlemen.
Hey, Howie.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.681
It's Howard.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.250
Just Howard.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.001
Sorry.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.920
You know what? I just
gave up a Super Soaker.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.411
Why don't you
get in there, bud?

29:19.520 --> 29:20.681
Oh!
Hmm.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.091
Maybe I will.
Yeah.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.486
I do enjoy Super Soakers.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.846
Yeah!

29:25.520 --> 29:27.921
You can see the difference
in personalities already.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.002
This one loves watermelon.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.969
This one's kind
of an asshole.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.288
I think everyone
had fun, right?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.010
Oh, totally.
It was great.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.206
What about Punit and Kia?

29:37.400 --> 29:38.401
Whoa!

29:38.600 --> 29:40.011
Kinda hate
each other, right?

29:40.120 --> 29:42.122
Sure seemed like it, yeah.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.006
"Enjoyed your video"?

30:13.200 --> 30:15.248
Where's the pizza cutter?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.291
Babe, do you see the pizza
cutter out there anywhere?

30:20.400 --> 30:21.401
Um...

30:22.040 --> 30:23.041
Yes?

30:24.080 --> 30:25.081
Jay.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.243
Jay, the pizza cutter?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.765
It's yours.

30:35.880 --> 30:37.325
I have so many
of them. Enjoy.

30:39.880 --> 30:40.881
Wow.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.164
Fuck me.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.640
Honey, are there any
more plates outside?

30:48.680 --> 30:49.727
Just a second.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.280
<i>Hello!</i>

31:01.360 --> 31:02.566
Hi!

31:05.680 --> 31:07.091
<i>Hello!</i>

31:09.440 --> 31:10.521
<i>Hello!</i>

31:10.600 --> 31:11.965
Honey...
Fuck!

31:14.640 --> 31:16.881
That sweater nice, girl.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.726
Thanks.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.081
I...

31:22.280 --> 31:23.725
Was it... Did I...

31:25.120 --> 31:26.326
Could...

31:33.440 --> 31:35.363
What the hell is going on?

31:36.160 --> 31:37.286
Um...

31:38.160 --> 31:39.161
It's, uh...

31:42.160 --> 31:43.241
When...

31:51.320 --> 31:53.004
You know the cloud?

31:53.840 --> 31:54.840
So what you're saying

31:54.880 --> 31:57.042
is that instead of erasing the video
like you said that you would,

31:57.120 --> 31:58.770
you actually ended up
sending it

31:58.840 --> 32:00.842
to everyone that
you ever given

32:00.920 --> 32:02.763
one of those
fucking iPads to?

32:02.840 --> 32:05.002
That is not at all what happened.
No?

32:05.080 --> 32:07.606
Well, technically, yes!
It's exactly what happened.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.763
But it was so accidental,
it doesn't even qualify as...

32:13.200 --> 32:14.281
Thank you.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.361
Hank Rosenbaum!

32:15.440 --> 32:17.204
What?
The Piper Brothers guy!

32:17.320 --> 32:19.766
You gave him one? Yes! I told
you I needed one for work.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.444
I put my entire
presentation on it.

32:21.520 --> 32:22.601
You did?

32:22.680 --> 32:26.162
I'm supposed to be the model
Piper Brothers mother!

32:26.320 --> 32:28.004
Maybe he hasn't
seen it yet.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.527
As a matter of fact, Annie, I'm willing
to bet that none of these people

32:30.600 --> 32:32.728
have even noticed that the
video is on there yet.

32:32.800 --> 32:33.920
Except for this text, but...

32:36.160 --> 32:37.446
What text?

32:37.720 --> 32:39.449
I received a text.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.561
From who?

32:40.640 --> 32:41.721
It's unclear.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.047
I'm not sure how to hurt
you right now, Jay.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.201
I know.

32:51.320 --> 32:52.680
But let's take a deep breath.
Shit!

32:52.880 --> 32:54.041
Come sit down next to me.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.804
Come sit down. Come here.

32:55.880 --> 32:56.961
Let's look at

32:57.040 --> 32:59.327
what's actually happened.
Okay.

32:59.480 --> 33:00.720
We made a video

33:00.880 --> 33:03.360
of ourselves having sex

33:03.520 --> 33:04.806
for about three hours,

33:04.920 --> 33:06.331
and it was amazing, right?

33:06.400 --> 33:07.811
Yeah, no, it was great.
Okay.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.491
And then you asked me
to erase it and I forgot.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.848
You forgot?
I forgot.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.490
And now our video

33:14.560 --> 33:17.723
has been synced
to several devices.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.051
All of which, though, are basically
in the possession of friends.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.844
Oh, God.
And acquaintances.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.081
And the mailman.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.767
Oh, God!

33:25.920 --> 33:27.285
Who sent you
that text, Jay?

33:27.400 --> 33:28.481
I don't know.
I don't know, Annie.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.846
Did you call the number?

33:29.920 --> 33:32.890
That is actually
a really good idea.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.769
Oh, my God.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.049
<i>Your call
has been forwarded...</i>

33:40.240 --> 33:41.765
Voice mail!
Okay, oh.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.763
Hi, this is Jay Hargrove.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.486
Could you give me
a call back

33:46.560 --> 33:48.528
at your earliest
convenience, please?

33:48.760 --> 33:51.366
I believe you have
the number. Bye.

33:53.800 --> 33:54.847
That's it?

33:54.920 --> 33:56.410
What the hell else was I
supposed to say to the guy?

33:56.480 --> 33:58.209
"Who the fuck is this?"

33:58.280 --> 34:00.521
I wouldn't call back if someone
left that on my machine.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.644
Okay, we have to get
these iPads back right now.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.761
Hello?

34:06.840 --> 34:08.569
Hi, Mom!
Hi, honey.

34:08.639 --> 34:10.722
<i>Is there any chance
that you might be able</i>

34:10.800 --> 34:13.565
to come and, um, watch the kids
for us, uh, like, right away?

34:13.639 --> 34:14.721
Right now?

34:14.800 --> 34:16.484
We really need you to,
like, right away

34:16.560 --> 34:17.971
<i>if you could come over.</i>

34:18.040 --> 34:19.530
Why, I suppose.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.688
- Thanks, Mom. That's so great.
- Thanks. Annie.

34:21.760 --> 34:22.841
Hold on a second. What?

34:22.920 --> 34:24.524
It might be worth
asking your mom,

34:25.280 --> 34:26.804
um, to bring her iPad.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.484
Are you kidding me?

34:29.239 --> 34:31.004
And could you
bring your iPad, too?

34:31.320 --> 34:33.129
My iPad?
Yeah.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.610
Okay.
<i>Great,</i> okay.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.484
What are you not gonna forget?
The iPad.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.960
So say goodbye, hang up
and then come right away.

34:39.239 --> 34:40.400
Okay. All right.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.608
Can you hang up?
Okay, honey.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.606
Okay, hang up now, Mom.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.091
Okay, say goodbye.

34:46.159 --> 34:47.241
Okay, hang up.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.322
Bye.
Okay, bye!

34:50.000 --> 34:51.081
Who else
has these things?

34:51.159 --> 34:52.161
Let's think about it.

34:52.360 --> 34:54.840
Robby, the mailman...

34:55.600 --> 34:57.762
Every time you say
"mailman," Jay,

34:58.080 --> 34:59.241
I'm just gonna hit you.

34:59.320 --> 35:00.446
You see, it was Christmas...

35:00.520 --> 35:01.567
I don't give a shit.

35:01.640 --> 35:05.486
Mailman, Robby, Hank,
my mother, and who else?

35:07.640 --> 35:08.687
Oh, my God!

35:08.760 --> 35:09.761
Clive?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.683
May I see that for
a second, honey? Why?

35:11.760 --> 35:13.762
Just for a second.
I was using that!

35:13.880 --> 35:14.961
What the hell?

35:15.040 --> 35:16.121
I can't take any chances.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.645
Okay, kid!
Come on, Jay!

35:18.520 --> 35:21.126
Grandma's here for
some mysterious reason!

35:21.200 --> 35:22.804
Oh, my gosh!
Is that the iPad

35:22.880 --> 35:24.530
I gave you?
I love that iPad.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.563
Can I borrow it?
Why is Grandma here?

35:26.640 --> 35:28.961
Yay! Grandma!

35:29.040 --> 35:30.485
Okay. Grandma's gonna
watch you guys

35:30.560 --> 35:31.925
while Mommy
and Daddy go out.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.411
You guys can order
Chinese food.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.130
I hate Chinese food.
Okay. Then order a pizza.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.770
Once again,
enjoy this iPad.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.330
I had to make sure it
was working. Enjoy that.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.846
Let's go! Thank you.
What about my iPad?

35:40.920 --> 35:42.046
Thank you.

35:45.840 --> 35:50.448
Man. The construction on these
things is just unbelievable.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.124
Jay! Come on,
Jay, let's go!

35:52.200 --> 35:53.565
Let's go to Robby and Tess' house first!
Let's go!

35:53.640 --> 35:55.085
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Sorry! Got it!

35:58.400 --> 36:00.164
So I'm just
trying to understand

36:00.240 --> 36:02.004
why it is that you
don't erase these things

36:02.080 --> 36:03.809
before you give
them to people.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.041
I have amazing playlists

36:05.120 --> 36:06.610
and people want them.
That's the gift.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.200
The gift is the playlist,
not the iPad.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.687
When I update my music library,
it syncs to their iPads.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.491
I use an app called Frankensync
to sync the playlists.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.403
I upgraded
to this new app,

36:16.480 --> 36:18.005
Bride of Frankensync,

36:18.080 --> 36:21.289
and now, apparently,
it syncs all of my shit

36:21.560 --> 36:24.166
to everywhere 'cause it's
a very powerful app!

36:24.240 --> 36:27.449
How do you forget to
erase your sex tape?

36:27.520 --> 36:29.204
It kept slipping my mind

36:29.280 --> 36:31.362
and then, the next thing
I knew, it went up!

36:31.520 --> 36:33.010
It went up to the cloud!

36:33.080 --> 36:34.525
And you can't get it
down from the cloud?

36:34.600 --> 36:35.761
Nobody understands
the cloud!

36:36.400 --> 36:37.731
It's a fucking mystery!

36:38.800 --> 36:41.201
Look, all that's happened
here is there's been a very

36:41.280 --> 36:42.884
minor syncing mishap.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.200
This is not minor!

36:44.280 --> 36:46.726
And I wish that you would
just admit that you fucked up

36:46.800 --> 36:49.451
instead of trying to convince
me that this isn't a big deal

36:49.560 --> 36:51.164
'cause it is a big deal.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.571
You know what, Annie?

36:52.640 --> 36:54.005
I'm on there, too.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.082
Oh, who gives a shit?
Nobody cares about you.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.889
Nobody wants to watch
you having sex.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.201
You said it yourself.
Nobody cares about the guy!

37:00.320 --> 37:03.000
It's the woman that has to live with
it forever.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.201
Who is it?
"Guess who?" Smiley face.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.486
Who the fuck is this?
Fuck!

37:08.720 --> 37:11.371
It's gotta be Tess.
It's gotta be Tess.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.891
You think?
Yeah!

37:13.000 --> 37:16.288
With the whole "XOXO smiley face" thing?
Yeah. It's Tess.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.084
Right, is that really
a Tess thing,

37:18.160 --> 37:21.164
or is that more of like a,
uh, very, very common thing?

37:21.240 --> 37:22.890
No, it's a Tess thing.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.849
She must just be
joking around.

37:24.920 --> 37:28.049
Except her number is in my
phone so it would say, "Tess."

37:28.120 --> 37:30.487
Well, maybe
she got a new phone.

37:30.600 --> 37:31.931
She probably saw
what it was

37:32.000 --> 37:33.923
and stopped watching it
immediately

37:34.000 --> 37:36.162
because she has so much
respect for our privacy.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.845
This makes perfect sense.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.770
Right. Okay.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.763
Okay, great. It's Tess.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.285
I'd buy it.
Yeah.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.442
She picks up the iPad, sees
there's a sex tape on there,

37:45.520 --> 37:48.330
pushes play, it's us,
immediately stopped it,

37:48.400 --> 37:50.129
'cause she respects us.
Yes.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.964
Then she went out and got a new
phone and a new phone number.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.081
Yeah.

37:53.160 --> 37:54.525
So do you think that means
Robby has seen it, too?

37:54.600 --> 37:56.762
Well, if he's seen it, you're gonna
have to get a new best friend.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.047
We're just gonna cut Robby
and Tess out of our lives?

37:59.200 --> 38:02.647
Yeah, that's right. And if the
mailman has seen it, we're movin'.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.206
Wait.
What if it's not Tess?

38:12.280 --> 38:13.964
Okay, look. We're just
gonna feel this out,

38:14.040 --> 38:15.201
and if it doesn't
seem like it's her,

38:15.240 --> 38:17.163
we just don't say anything at all.
Okay? Of course.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.561
No, no. They do not need
to know about this. Okay?

38:19.680 --> 38:21.125
Babe, it's gonna be
pretty easy

38:21.200 --> 38:23.168
to tell if they've
seen it or not.

38:30.800 --> 38:31.881
Hey!

38:31.960 --> 38:33.246
Hey.
Hey!

38:33.720 --> 38:34.721
What's going on?

38:36.320 --> 38:37.446
What's going on
with you?

38:38.080 --> 38:40.731
Nothing. Nothing.
Just hanging out.

38:41.480 --> 38:43.005
It's our anniversary,
actually,

38:43.080 --> 38:45.242
so Marta took Howard
to a movie

38:45.320 --> 38:46.526
and we're just, uh,

38:46.600 --> 38:49.410
hanging out,
watching some...

38:50.560 --> 38:52.642
Hey! What are you
guys doing here?

38:52.720 --> 38:54.085
Hey-
Hey.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.811
We're so sorry to
drop by like this

38:56.880 --> 38:58.325
on your anniversary
and all.

38:58.440 --> 39:01.091
Yeah, why didn't you guys mention
it was your anniversary?

39:01.280 --> 39:04.489
Uh, cause it's our 12th anniversary?
Yeah.

39:04.560 --> 39:08.121
Like, who cares, right?
So...

39:08.240 --> 39:09.401
You guys wanna come in?

39:14.880 --> 39:15.881
Or not.

39:17.400 --> 39:18.686
What were you guys
watching?

39:22.120 --> 39:23.690
Um...

39:25.120 --> 39:27.361
This is really embarrassing.
Yeah.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.124
Just tell us what
you guys were watching.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.160
Yeah. It's not a big deal.
What were you watching?

39:33.440 --> 39:34.805
Okay, all right,
all right.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.644
We're watching the first
season of Breaking Bad.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.370
It's really
embarrassing

39:38.480 --> 39:39.561
how far behind we are.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.051
That's a great show.
Yeah.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.531
You guys really
are far behind.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.801
That's all right.
Don't tell us what happens!

39:43.960 --> 39:45.007
Hey, while we're here,

39:45.080 --> 39:46.764
remember that iPad
I gave you?

39:47.000 --> 39:48.047
Yeah.
Yeah.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.131
I need that back.

39:50.760 --> 39:51.886
Oh, uh...

39:52.280 --> 39:54.044
Okay. Oh, was that why you...

39:54.160 --> 39:55.400
Is that why you
came here

39:55.480 --> 39:57.482
to our house,
to get your iPad back?

39:59.160 --> 40:00.400
Well...
Um...

40:02.320 --> 40:04.084
I have some stuff on it
that I need.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.844
What? Dirty pictures
or something?

40:06.480 --> 40:08.244
You guys
make a sex tape?

40:09.120 --> 40:10.485
Did you guys watch it?

40:13.680 --> 40:15.125
I was kidding.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.323
What the fuck?

40:19.160 --> 40:21.367
And then Jay received
this text that said,

40:21.480 --> 40:24.848
"Loved your video. Thanks
for sharing. XOXO."

40:24.920 --> 40:26.888
And you thought
that was from me?

40:26.960 --> 40:28.200
Well, it sounded like you.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.920
I don't think if I'd seen your sex
tape, I would have done "XOXO."

40:31.400 --> 40:33.004
I was hoping
it was you...

40:33.080 --> 40:34.491
Because if it wasn't me,
then who is it?

40:34.560 --> 40:35.846
No, I get it. I get it.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.844
Um... Could we back up
for just a second?

40:40.240 --> 40:41.890
So you taped yourself
having sex for three hours?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.161
Yes.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.645
Why did you do that?

40:46.200 --> 40:47.565
Never mind.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.127
Who has sex for three hours?
We did.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.044
That's the length of the movie Lincoln.
You did the full Lincoln.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.571
Well, guys, I'm sorry,
you know,

40:55.680 --> 40:57.523
but I'm not the one
who sent that text.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.327
God, this isn't happening. Oh...

41:00.400 --> 41:02.641
Oh, okay, uh,
who else has these things?

41:02.720 --> 41:05.007
You guys, the mailman...

41:06.200 --> 41:07.486
Hank Rosenbaum.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.483
Piper Brothers guy?
Yes!

41:09.560 --> 41:10.925
Oh, the guy that wants
to buy your blog?

41:11.000 --> 41:12.843
And who's very concerned
about my image.

41:12.920 --> 41:13.921
Okay, I'm an idiot!

41:14.000 --> 41:15.525
No! Come on!
You messed up.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.601
No.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.000
He is. Let him have that.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.361
I would have killed you.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.329
Oh, I mean, if you had thought
about it for a second,

41:21.400 --> 41:23.846
you'd know to just
password-protect your shit.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.007
I would have killed
you in your sleep.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.366
Or just fucking delete it.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.010
Oh, my God. Wait!

41:28.080 --> 41:29.161
Wait a minute!
What?

41:29.240 --> 41:30.969
My sister is his florist!

41:31.040 --> 41:33.247
Oh, my God, do you think
she knows where he lives?

41:33.320 --> 41:35.368
Yeah, I think she's been to his house.
She's his florist!

41:35.440 --> 41:36.441
Hold on.
What's the plan here?

41:36.520 --> 41:37.806
We're just gonna show up
at this guy's house?

41:37.880 --> 41:39.689
Yeah! And we're coming with you!

41:39.760 --> 41:41.250
Oh, my God. It'll be a fun night!
We have a sitter!

41:41.360 --> 41:43.010
I'll call Rochelle.
Yeah!

41:45.080 --> 41:48.402
Hey, my sister thought the every
position thing was a great idea!

41:48.480 --> 41:50.369
You told your sister?
What is up?

41:50.440 --> 41:52.880
Big supporter of you. Well,
I thought she'd be thrilled.

41:52.920 --> 41:53.921
Hey-

41:54.520 --> 41:55.521
iPad.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.284
Yeah, yeah.
Boy, what a mess.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.930
No. Can I have it?

41:59.720 --> 42:00.721
Huh?

42:01.680 --> 42:03.523
The iPad.
Yeah.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.526
You came over here
to get it.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.364
I need the iPad, please.

42:07.440 --> 42:08.720
What if I can't
get it right now?

42:08.760 --> 42:10.000
Just give me the iPad.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.208
What if I just erase the
video myself? Dude.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.480
Okay. You're gonna have to
give me all that music again.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.927
Dude!
Oh, fine! Jeez!

42:21.520 --> 42:23.124
Did you just pull
this out of your pants?

42:24.880 --> 42:25.881
Yeah.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.371
I feel like a second ago,

42:27.480 --> 42:29.687
you said you couldn't
remember where it was.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.486
I forgot.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.160
Fair enough.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.604
It's an easy mistake to make.
Okay.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.291
So, what are we
gonna do?

42:43.360 --> 42:44.885
Yeah.
What's the plan, gang?

42:44.960 --> 42:46.883
Should we pretend
we have a flat,

42:47.000 --> 42:48.764
and none of us
had our cell phones?

42:48.840 --> 42:51.286
We knock. You're like, "Hank!
What a surprise!"

42:51.360 --> 42:53.328
Yes. And then l
jump in and I say,

42:53.400 --> 42:55.289
"Hi. I'm your
florist's sister, Tess."

42:55.360 --> 42:56.850
Feel like this is just

42:56.920 --> 42:58.888
a super weird way
to spend your anniversary.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.406
For a 12th anniversary, I think it's
pretty solid. ANNIE: You know what?

43:01.480 --> 43:03.528
You guys stay in the car.
It's our mess.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.210
We can go clean it up.
Right, babe?

43:05.280 --> 43:07.169
I think we'd really like
to be part of the plan.

43:07.240 --> 43:08.571
Let us participate.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.926
Guys, we're gonna be
in and out up there.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.286
We're gonna knock
on the door.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.289
Yes, it'll be a little
awkward at first.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.164
But I really think
it'll be fine.

43:18.400 --> 43:19.890
Okay, so this is what
we're gonna do.

43:19.960 --> 43:22.406
I'll distract him, you say you
have to go to the bathroom,

43:22.480 --> 43:25.165
and then you search the house for the iPad.
Good? Okay, let's go.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.368
Annie. Annie, can you
hold on one second?

43:27.440 --> 43:28.601
Get up here.
That house is huge.

43:28.680 --> 43:30.364
We'll tell him
you have diarrhea.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.165
First of all,
that's embarrassing.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.641
And second of all, who tells
someone that they have diarrhea?

43:34.720 --> 43:35.960
Food poisoning.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.327
Okay. How about I distract him
and you have the food poisoning?

43:38.400 --> 43:39.447
Uh, no. l am not gonna
have food poisoning.

43:39.520 --> 43:40.965
You're gonna have
food poisoning.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.644
The person who
forgets to erase

43:42.720 --> 43:44.131
the sex tape
has food poisoning.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.565
It's in the book.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.608
Annie!
Oh...

43:50.880 --> 43:52.166
Well, I'll be!

43:52.240 --> 43:53.651
Hank? Hey!

43:53.720 --> 43:55.563
What a surprise.
This is so crazy.

43:55.640 --> 43:56.766
You live here?

43:56.840 --> 43:59.605
I'm sorry. I'm lost.
You two know each other?

43:59.680 --> 44:01.728
This is Hank, honey. Remember
I was telling you about Hank?

44:01.800 --> 44:03.006
Hank Rosenbaum?

44:03.080 --> 44:04.206
Hank Rosenbaum!

44:04.280 --> 44:05.406
This is my husband, Jay.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.642
Jay. The famous Jay.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.802
In the flesh. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.086
- Likewise.
- Wow!

44:11.160 --> 44:13.686
What a crazy coincidence,
honey. Right? Wow.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.569
We were just randomly
in the neighborhood.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.325
We've been knocking
on doors trying to, uh,

44:18.400 --> 44:20.164
collect money
for a charity.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.321
What charity?

44:21.400 --> 44:24.244
Uh, it's for, um... Charity for...
For kids.

44:24.320 --> 44:27.005
Yeah, for kids
that have, um,

44:27.080 --> 44:28.320
oversized...

44:28.480 --> 44:29.527
Kidneys.
Kidneys.

44:29.840 --> 44:30.887
They got these

44:31.480 --> 44:33.050
enormous kidneys.

44:33.160 --> 44:34.207
It's so sad.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.163
You have to see it. So we're
just trying to help them out.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.049
"Hey, Dad. Da.

44:38.120 --> 44:40.088
"What is this bulge
in me back, Da?"

44:41.320 --> 44:43.721
"That's your kidney, son.
Get on with it."

44:43.800 --> 44:45.564
They're, uh,
British orphans.

44:45.640 --> 44:48.484
Yeah, so we're just out to try
to raise some money for it.

44:48.600 --> 44:52.241
Anyhow, would you possibly
want to contribute?

44:53.360 --> 44:56.045
Yes. Please. Come in.
I will get my checkbook.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.600
Thanks. That's just
so generous of you.

44:58.720 --> 45:01.485
Hey, do you think that Jay
could use your bathroom?

45:01.600 --> 45:03.967
Because he has diarrhea.
Oh.

45:04.280 --> 45:06.567
Food poisoning. He has
the shits, as they say.

45:07.520 --> 45:09.966
Oh, sure, it's right
down the hall. Go crazy.

45:10.120 --> 45:11.121
Thank you.

45:11.400 --> 45:12.401
Mmm.

45:12.520 --> 45:14.921
Oh, well, come on in and
make yourself comfortable.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.081
Oh, thank you.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.207
Wow! It's a really
lovely house.

45:24.280 --> 45:25.850
Oh, thank you.
Put on some music.

45:25.920 --> 45:27.888
Sure. Wow!

45:28.000 --> 45:30.128
Shit! Fuck!

45:31.400 --> 45:32.640
What the fuck?

45:36.120 --> 45:37.963
Would you like
something to drink?

45:39.320 --> 45:40.321
What?

45:40.480 --> 45:44.201
I'm sorry. Let me turn
this down so we can talk.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.803
Can I get you
something to drink?

45:48.680 --> 45:49.920
Sure.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.445
Schlomit and the kids
are away,

45:51.560 --> 45:53.847
so I'm just spreading
my wings.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.923
Drinking some scotch.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.001
Ah.

45:57.080 --> 45:58.844
Fifty years old.
Yeah.

45:59.120 --> 46:00.690
The good stuff.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.922
Here's to our
bright future together.

46:07.680 --> 46:09.011
Whatever it may hold.

46:17.400 --> 46:21.166
Wow. That's a really,
uh, interesting painting.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.446
Do you like it?

46:22.520 --> 46:23.646
Yeah.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.650
I had it commissioned.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.921
It's a moment from
the movie The Lion <i>King.</i>

46:29.080 --> 46:32.004
Except it's me
in place of Rafiki.

46:32.160 --> 46:34.128
So, that's me

46:35.120 --> 46:37.361
presenting Simba
to all of the creatures

46:37.480 --> 46:40.086
from the Pride Lands
to behold.

46:42.160 --> 46:44.003
It's beautiful.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.491
Thank you.

46:46.120 --> 46:47.246
You know what?

46:47.320 --> 46:49.240
I'm gonna put on something
a little more festive.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.247
Hi.

47:09.920 --> 47:11.809
Hey, hey, little guy.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.487
Stay.

47:18.120 --> 47:19.201
Stay!

47:24.520 --> 47:25.646
Sit!

47:26.520 --> 47:27.521
You seem,

47:27.600 --> 47:30.126
I don't know,
nervous.

47:30.360 --> 47:32.488
It's just a little awkward
showing up at your house

47:32.560 --> 47:34.528
and asking you
for a donation, is all.

47:34.640 --> 47:36.324
I'm glad you're here.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.642
I could use the company.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.000
Wow!

47:42.960 --> 47:44.086
I know.

47:58.520 --> 48:00.488
No, no, no!
Please! No! No!

48:00.560 --> 48:02.085
No! Stay!

48:02.160 --> 48:03.161
Heel!

48:04.920 --> 48:06.365
I was hoping that
we would get a chance

48:06.440 --> 48:07.566
to get to know
each other.

48:07.640 --> 48:10.564
Mmm. Me, too. What a
wonderful coincidence.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.210
There's no such
thing as coincidence.

48:12.280 --> 48:13.645
That's what Schlomit
always says.

48:14.840 --> 48:16.285
Oh, is this your family?

48:16.360 --> 48:18.488
Yeah. That's all of us
at Aspen.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.406
There's Schlo and, uh,

48:20.480 --> 48:22.369
my son, Benyamin,
and Sarah.

48:22.440 --> 48:23.487
They're very sweet.

48:27.960 --> 48:29.291
No! No!

48:29.360 --> 48:30.441
Help!

48:30.840 --> 48:31.921
Hank!

48:32.000 --> 48:34.082
No! Not my face!
Not my face!

48:34.160 --> 48:35.161
Help!

48:48.960 --> 48:50.485
I didn't wanna do that.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.560
Fuck with me, you're
gonna get hit by a book.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.682
That's what's gonna happen.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.608
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

49:07.720 --> 49:09.404
You know, it's funny.

49:09.480 --> 49:12.962
When the family's away you find
yourself thinking about things

49:13.040 --> 49:15.691
that you don't think
about all the time.

49:15.760 --> 49:16.966
I bet.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.088
You think about
who you were,

49:19.160 --> 49:20.207
and who you've become.

49:20.480 --> 49:21.606
Mmm.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.925
Would you like to
do some cocaine?

49:25.040 --> 49:26.121
I'm sorry?

49:26.400 --> 49:28.528
I'm just doin' some blow
while the family's away.

49:28.600 --> 49:29.647
Would you like a bump?

49:31.480 --> 49:34.609
No, I don't think
that's really, um...

49:35.120 --> 49:36.201
I see.

49:36.960 --> 49:38.803
I mean, not that
I have a problem with...

49:38.880 --> 49:40.530
I mean, I do have a...

49:41.640 --> 49:44.325
Is this some sort...
It's a test?

49:46.240 --> 49:48.163
Oh, okay, I see
what's happening here.

49:48.240 --> 49:51.403
You're thinking about all that
talk about Piper Brothers values.

49:51.480 --> 49:53.164
But if you think
situationally,

49:53.240 --> 49:55.481
friendship is
a Piper Brothers value.

49:55.560 --> 49:56.721
One of the big ones.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.724
And that's all
that's happening here.

49:58.800 --> 50:01.451
We're just hanging around,
getting to know one other,

50:01.560 --> 50:02.925
and doin' some rails.

50:03.720 --> 50:04.767
Uh-huh.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.526
But if that's
not your thing...

50:09.480 --> 50:10.811
Well, uh...

50:11.320 --> 50:13.288
Okay. Right.

50:13.520 --> 50:14.960
Better make sure
that Jay's not lost.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.446
No, no, no! He's fine.
Let's do cocaine!

50:18.080 --> 50:19.127
Super!

50:35.200 --> 50:36.281
Oh, shit!

50:40.320 --> 50:41.526
Are you okay?

50:46.160 --> 50:47.207
Wow!

50:47.480 --> 50:49.130
Wow!

50:49.280 --> 50:52.762
See? That's what I'm saying.
We get older and we forget.

50:52.840 --> 50:55.730
People, they stop doing the
things that they love.

50:55.800 --> 50:57.962
And for some people,
it could be surfing.

50:58.040 --> 51:00.042
For some people,
it could be traveling.

51:00.160 --> 51:01.924
For me,
it's gettin' high

51:02.000 --> 51:03.650
and listen' to
freakin' Slayer.

51:03.720 --> 51:06.929
That just, like,
blows my mind

51:07.040 --> 51:08.610
that that's what
it is for you.

51:08.680 --> 51:10.523
But that's your point.
That's my point.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.523
'Cause it's so
small-minded of me

51:12.600 --> 51:14.204
to assume anything.
Right?

51:14.280 --> 51:15.805
Because I don't know you.
You don't know me.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.769
I don't know you. Yeah.
You know the idea of me.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.683
The CEO that controls
your future.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.000
But that's not me.
No.

51:21.080 --> 51:23.651
And it's like you, I'm sure there are
things about you that nobody knows.

51:23.720 --> 51:25.165
Fuck yeah, there are.

51:25.240 --> 51:26.924
Can I show you something?
Yeah!

51:27.960 --> 51:28.961
Whoa.

51:29.040 --> 51:31.247
Piper Brothers, 75 years.

51:31.320 --> 51:32.765
But very few people
know about that.

51:32.840 --> 51:33.841
Whoa!

51:34.000 --> 51:35.240
And there's more.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.047
Eazy-E!

51:40.840 --> 51:42.365
I miss him every day.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.124
That's so touching.
Did you know him?

51:44.200 --> 51:47.727
Annie, it's like... It's just...
Lotta parts up in me.

51:51.560 --> 51:52.686
Wake up!

51:53.600 --> 51:56.001
Wake up, you fuckin'
cocksucker!

52:08.280 --> 52:13.081
<i>Sm, how do you perform
CPR on a dog?</i>

52:13.200 --> 52:16.647
<i>I found
four places named "Starbucks."</i>

52:24.240 --> 52:26.402
What the fuck
is happening?

52:40.200 --> 52:41.600
And then you
become a mother, right?

52:41.640 --> 52:42.721
And it becomes
about the kids.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.689
Which is great, because you
want it to be about the kids.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.160
But then you need
time for yourself.

52:46.200 --> 52:47.326
That's why
I started writing.

52:47.400 --> 52:50.449
But it's, like, writing
about Jay and the kids,

52:50.560 --> 52:51.607
and then it becomes a job.

52:51.680 --> 52:53.284
But I love my job.
I love my job.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.761
But I need to work out.
I need to work out.

52:55.840 --> 52:56.841
It's not even for me.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.365
It's, like, for
everybody else.

52:58.440 --> 53:01.125
Because l'll go bat-shit crazy.
Like, crazy, crazy, crazy.

53:01.240 --> 53:03.720
I ran track.
I ran track in college.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.564
But, you know,
it's just so hard

53:05.640 --> 53:06.971
to find the time.
I know.

53:07.040 --> 53:08.451
To do anything, right?
It is.

53:08.520 --> 53:10.522
If you don't do that, then you
just sort of lose yourself.

53:10.600 --> 53:11.886
Do you want another line?

53:12.000 --> 53:14.128
No, I'm still enjoying the first
line quite a bit, thanks.

53:14.200 --> 53:15.531
You are so easy to talk to.

53:16.880 --> 53:18.484
I feel like you get me.

53:18.560 --> 53:21.245
Oh, God, I feel like
we get each other. Yeah.

53:21.880 --> 53:23.120
Where's your husband?

53:25.520 --> 53:28.330
I don't know!
Where is that fucker?

53:34.360 --> 53:37.330
What was that?
Was that the doorbell?

53:37.440 --> 53:38.646
There's a lot of
action here tonight.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.006
Yeah, there is.

53:42.960 --> 53:44.405
Hey! Okay.

53:45.560 --> 53:46.721
Can I help you?

53:46.880 --> 53:50.248
Hi! I'm the mayor,
Robby Thompson.

53:50.320 --> 53:52.163
Pleasure to meet you.
What's happening?

53:52.240 --> 53:54.083
The mayor?
Oh, not of this area.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.481
I'm mayor of
a different area.

53:56.560 --> 53:58.449
Of Thousand Oaks.

53:58.520 --> 54:01.046
He is the Mayor
of Thousand Oaks

54:01.120 --> 54:05.045
and I am his First Lady
of Thousand Oaks.

54:05.160 --> 54:06.321
- Okay.
- That's right.

54:06.440 --> 54:09.489
And we are out,
just talkin' to people,

54:09.760 --> 54:12.491
um, spreadin' the word
about Thousand Oaks.

54:12.960 --> 54:14.007
What word?

54:16.120 --> 54:17.849
Uh... uh...
Whew...

54:18.520 --> 54:19.601
Great town.

54:19.680 --> 54:22.365
It's a wonderful
city to raise a family.

54:22.440 --> 54:24.488
They have
the winningest, uh,

54:24.560 --> 54:26.085
Little League baseball
record in the country.

54:26.200 --> 54:28.931
Nobody gives a shit
about Thousand Oaks.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.604
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

54:30.680 --> 54:32.967
"Your Honor." Please. "Your
Honor's" my dad's name.

54:33.080 --> 54:35.560
"Mr. Mayor"
will be just fine.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.121
Hello.

54:49.040 --> 54:50.087
No!

54:50.400 --> 54:52.129
Sit!

54:53.400 --> 54:54.561
Fetch!

54:56.080 --> 54:57.161
Fetch!

55:07.840 --> 55:10.320
Anyway, we're out
talkin' to people

55:10.520 --> 55:11.646
about Thousand Oaks

55:11.720 --> 55:14.326
and we're collecting
donations

55:14.400 --> 55:16.767
for the Big Brother
charity program.

55:16.840 --> 55:18.080
Charity program.
Of Thousand Oaks.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.161
Of Thousand Oaks.

55:19.240 --> 55:20.969
What is it with
this new trend

55:21.040 --> 55:22.565
of late-night
charitable solicitations?

55:22.640 --> 55:23.760
I don't know.
I have no idea.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.365
Uh, we definitely

55:25.440 --> 55:26.601
accept money.
Eh...

55:26.680 --> 55:29.081
But what we really need

55:29.160 --> 55:31.288
are used iPads.

55:32.080 --> 55:33.286
That's a really good idea.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.691
It's a great idea.

55:34.760 --> 55:36.125
It is? I mean, really inspired.

55:36.200 --> 55:39.329
Yeah. I'm sure they
could really use that.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.601
Well, I have one.

55:40.680 --> 55:41.681
Oh!
No.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.920
Yeah.
I have one right here.

55:49.560 --> 55:50.971
You actually
gave me this.

55:51.040 --> 55:52.644
I haven't had a chance
to look at it yet.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.802
Oh, I don't need it.
Just give it to 'em.

55:54.880 --> 55:56.041
Do you mind
if I just give...

55:56.120 --> 55:57.201
God, no. Give it to 'em.
I don't care.

55:57.280 --> 55:58.320
It seems like a good cause.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.169
Thank you. Thank you.
This worked out great.

56:00.240 --> 56:01.241
Nice to meet you!
Have a good night!

56:01.320 --> 56:02.924
Good night!
Remember Thousand Oaks!

56:03.000 --> 56:04.843
Hi, I'm the mayor.
iPad!

56:06.160 --> 56:07.366
There he is!

56:08.640 --> 56:10.483
<i>Ariel! Hakuna matata!</i>

56:12.120 --> 56:13.167
Go play.

56:15.880 --> 56:17.803
Jay. What the hell
happened to you?

56:24.520 --> 56:26.488
I had an epileptic fit.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.645
In your bathroom.

56:28.720 --> 56:29.846
But your dog saved me.

56:31.800 --> 56:34.849
Because, in addition
to diarrhea,

56:38.320 --> 56:39.810
I'm also an epileptic.

56:40.120 --> 56:43.124
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

56:43.200 --> 56:46.329
We gotta go. It is
time for us to leave.

56:46.400 --> 56:48.368
This is when we should
get the hell out.

56:48.440 --> 56:50.966
Now. Just now is when
we should leave.

56:51.040 --> 56:53.168
'Cause, you know,
this is... Yeah.

56:54.480 --> 56:55.600
I did a little cocaine.
What?

56:55.680 --> 56:56.681
What?

56:56.760 --> 56:58.091
Just one line.
Just one line.

56:58.160 --> 56:59.366
One what?
A bump.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.251
What?
She did a line. So?

57:01.320 --> 57:02.526
Honey, let's just...
Okay.

57:02.600 --> 57:04.329
Thank you so much
for your hospitality.

57:04.440 --> 57:05.521
You've been so amazing.

57:05.600 --> 57:06.761
This is your cocaine straw.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.251
No, no, no.
Please. Keep it.

57:09.160 --> 57:10.400
Thank you.

57:25.920 --> 57:27.081
Okey-dokey.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.969
Thank you so much
for helping

57:29.040 --> 57:30.121
with our charity,

57:30.200 --> 57:33.727
but Annie and I need to get
movin' on those kidneys.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.484
Oh, I completely forgot.

57:35.560 --> 57:36.891
I need to go get
my checkbook.

57:36.960 --> 57:38.610
Thank you so much.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.081
What?

57:41.560 --> 57:43.403
"Just one line"?

57:43.520 --> 57:45.284
Who are you? What was
I supposed to do?

57:45.360 --> 57:47.488
Cocaine? That's the answer
to that question?

57:47.560 --> 57:50.404
He offered and I didn't
wanna seem judgmental.

57:50.480 --> 57:51.686
It was peer pressure.

57:52.640 --> 57:54.051
I was distracting him.

57:54.120 --> 57:56.327
With cocaine? What is this?
Fuckin' Scarface?

57:56.400 --> 57:57.686
Are you giving me shit?

57:57.800 --> 57:59.848
Is that what's happening right now?
Yeah!

57:59.960 --> 58:02.167
Mm-mm. No, I don't think so.
Annie.

58:02.240 --> 58:05.289
Annie. How is it that I get
mauled by an attack dog,

58:05.360 --> 58:06.964
I barely escape
with my life,

58:07.040 --> 58:09.850
you're in the living room
doing blow with your boss,

58:09.920 --> 58:11.843
and somehow,
you're mad at me?

58:11.920 --> 58:13.649
What did I do?
Oh, What did you do?

58:14.320 --> 58:16.971
You didn't erase
the fucking video, Jay!

58:17.040 --> 58:18.644
I told you, Annie.
I forgot.

58:18.720 --> 58:21.451
"I forgot." "I forgot." I've
heard you say that. "I forgot!"

58:21.560 --> 58:22.766
Okay, fine!
I didn't forget!

58:23.800 --> 58:26.531
I made a conscious decision
to keep the tape.

58:26.600 --> 58:28.489
And I was gonna
keep it forever!

58:28.560 --> 58:30.449
Because I had on video

58:30.520 --> 58:32.727
what was one of the
greatest nights of my life.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.643
And so I wanted
to keep it.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.245
For myself.

58:36.600 --> 58:39.888
And for my own
personal reference use.

58:39.960 --> 58:41.325
Yeah, you wanted it.

58:41.400 --> 58:43.209
But I specifically didn't
want you to keep it

58:43.280 --> 58:44.850
because I didn't want it
to get out and guess what?

58:44.920 --> 58:46.968
It did! It did immediately.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.724
That part was a mistake.

58:48.800 --> 58:50.290
I wanted to save it
for myself

58:50.360 --> 58:52.010
and then the fuckin' app...

58:52.080 --> 58:53.206
Stop talking
about the app,

58:53.280 --> 58:54.930
'cause this is just
typical of you.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.731
You do whatever the hell
you wanna do all the time,

58:57.800 --> 59:01.202
and I do everything.
I do everything.

59:01.280 --> 59:04.250
I hold this shit down,
is what I do.

59:04.320 --> 59:05.606
Clearly, you should not
do cocaine.

59:05.680 --> 59:07.170
Maybe I should do
more cocaine.

59:07.240 --> 59:09.811
Because I've never done it
before and I kinda like it.

59:09.880 --> 59:11.120
I'm fairly certain
the answer

59:11.200 --> 59:12.611
is not for you
to do more cocaine.

59:12.680 --> 59:15.331
This sex tape.
This night.

59:15.400 --> 59:16.686
This is the kind of thing

59:16.760 --> 59:18.649
that reveals a lot
about a person.

59:20.840 --> 59:21.921
Oh, really?

59:22.000 --> 59:23.126
Reveals a whole lot
about a person.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.326
You know what?
Just shut up.

59:24.400 --> 59:25.447
I tried not to say it!

59:25.520 --> 59:28.126
This kind of thing,
a crisis,

59:28.200 --> 59:30.441
reveals who someone
really is deep down.

59:30.520 --> 59:33.205
And you, you can't think
about anyone else but you.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.687
Okay, that is... Jay does
what Jay wants to do.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.609
You have to go
to a concert

59:37.680 --> 59:39.091
three nights in a row.

59:39.160 --> 59:40.161
For work?

59:40.240 --> 59:42.481
But that's my job, Annie.
We're a team.

59:42.560 --> 59:44.642
And part of what I do
on that team is I work.

59:44.720 --> 59:46.560
That's what makes me
a good teammate, isn't it?

59:46.600 --> 59:48.887
I don't just wanna
be a teammate!

59:51.440 --> 59:53.249
Why did we stop
having sex?

59:53.880 --> 59:54.881
What?

59:56.040 --> 59:57.480
Annie, it's not like
we just stopped.

59:57.520 --> 59:58.681
No, you know what I mean.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.842
It's just, like,
why did...

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.402
When did we stop
needing to be close?

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.131
When did I become
so annoying?

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.281
I don't know!

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.843
I think the coke
is wearing off.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.082
That's a bummer, man. I was
having a blast. Really?

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.650
We really gotta find out
who's been sending

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.563
these fucking texts.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.731
Are they...

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.889
They're having sex
in our car.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.370
It appears that way.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.610
Sorry, guys.
Yeah, sorry.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.727
I'm not even gonna
ask if you guys...

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.961
Yes, we watched the video.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.280
You said you weren't
gonna say anything.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.249
I know we weren't gonna say
anything, but I can't lie to Jay.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.407
And besides, we just

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.881
skimmed it because
we didn't have time.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.445
Oh, my God!

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.411
Annie, there is nothing
to be ashamed of.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.766
He's right.
There's not.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.882
At first, yes,
I thought there was.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.008
But now, I've seen it.
And there's not.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.923
No, it's the most natural
thing in the world.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.249
I think this might be...

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.482
No, it definitely is

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.602
the most embarrassing
moment of my life.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.001
Oh, no, no, no. You should
not feel embarrassed.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.606
If anything,
you should feel proud.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.886
Yeah, your body's insane.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.001
Oh, my God.
Okay.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.366
Truly, I admire you
for it.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.329
I can't believe that
you let him watch it!

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.686
I'm sorry.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.445
He wanted to watch it. I wanted
to watch it. Just a little peek.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.890
But then, we got very
involved with it.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.961
We got really
wrapped up in it.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.081
Oh, my God!

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.089
Oh, great dick,
by the way.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.006
Yeah. Thank you.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.168
Honestly, the whole thing
was a big turn-on.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.282
Oh, my God. We noticed. Yes.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.682
Guys, could I have
the iPad back, please?

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.361
Really? I mean we...
Dude!

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.124
Okay, fine!

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.006
There you go. You're
obsessed with that thing.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.720
Wait.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.361
We shall never speak
of this night again.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.567
Absolutely.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.801
Of course.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.809
I need a bathroom
and an aspirin.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.086
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, of course.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.241
Come on in.
Please.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.001
Dad. Mom.
Hey, pal.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.127
Hey, sweetie.
Hi, Marta.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.608
Howard is study.
I was. In my room.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.170
Annie, Jay.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.605
What a surprise,
you guys.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.284
We were
just out, uh...

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.001
gettin' a drink.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.450
Celebrate the ol'
anniversary.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.931
Here. I'll get you
an aspirin.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.286
Okay. I'm gonna
use the bathroom.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.925
Want a shirt?

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.320
Yeah. That'd be great. Thanks, bud.
I'll get you a shirt.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.364
Get outta my way!

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.521
So, here we are.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.083
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.368
Did you receive
my text message?

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.886
What?

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.847
Yeah. You know, you really
should be more careful, Jay.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.041
Wait, are you...

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.043
No. 'Cause
you're just too...

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.246
Is this a...

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.724
Stop babbling already, Jay.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.802
I think we both know that
I already own your ass.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.727
You own my ass?

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.086
What, do I have to
spell it out for you?

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.003
I have your sex tape.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.800
You're fucked.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.485
I got news for you.
What?

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.561
I got the iPad back.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.730
You got the iPad back?
Yeah.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.565
That's fantastic, man. Good effort.
Look at me.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.485
Do I look like a kid
who knows how to make

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.961
a simple copy of an
MP4 or do I not?

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.450
Yeah, you do.
And look at you.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.090
Runnin' around
trying to collect up

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.481
all your iPads
before time runs out.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.403
Why didn't you
just remote wipe them?

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.406
You can do that?

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.761
Fuck!

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.321
Fuck me!

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.810
I almost murdered a dog.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.681
Yeah.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.689
But I already uploaded
your sorry-ass video

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.966
to a site called YouPorn.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.765
Should be up by
tomorrow morning.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.888
And sadly, the only one that
can take the video down

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.610
is the original poster
and that's me.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.649
Okay, this is a...

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.569
I got it.
This is a joke, right?

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.841
You're joking.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.329
You didn't put...

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.486
What do you want?
Hmm.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.011
You want an Xbox?

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.282
You can get me an Xbox?
Do you want an Xbox?

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.284
Like, the new Xbox?
Yeah.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.686
What do I look
like to you, Jay?

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.211
A fucking idiot? No!

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.891
I want $25,000 in cash.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.645
$25,000?

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.765
Howard. First of all, I don't
have $25,000 just sittin' around.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.241
And besides, what are you
gonna do with $25,000?

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.685
I'm gonna buy a horse.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.763
Yeah, I'm gonna buy
a motherfucking horse

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.285
to keep my bitches happy-

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.122
I think it's time for me to have
a little talk with your parents.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.321
Try. Go ahead.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.760
I'll lie.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.444
They're gonna
believe me. Not you.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.961
Oh...

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.724
And don't you dare
tell Annie about this.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.731
I'm gonna tell Annie.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.401
Okay-

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.323
But before you do,
just think about

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.925
these three words
for me, all right?

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.684
School. Email. Blast.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.881
Man! I need some
ice cream. Who's in?

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.240
Deal with it, Jay.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.805
You're fucked!

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.048
I got just so much
pressure inside me.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.761
Good talk, pal.
Seriously.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.001
Honey.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.764
Let's go home
and keep calling

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.729
that number until
someone answers.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.689
I just wanna know
who's sending these texts.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.881
<i>Uh-Oh.</i>

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.885
Uh-oh. Wanna do
the thing?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.405
Wanna do the four-flavor
thing?

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.482
Yeah, let's do that thing. Yeah.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.926
Robby, there's no easy way
for me to say this,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.321
but your kid is trying
to blackmail me

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.845
for $25,000!

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.567
Jay, can you hear
yourself right now?

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.724
I mean, look. You've had
a stressful day, right?

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.286
<i>Howard's just a kid.
He's not your problem.</i>

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.289
When you wake up,
you'll realize that.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.010
Would you just go
check his computer, huh?

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.327
<i>Check his phone!</i>

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.721
For me?
Jay.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.800
I'm not gonna look
at his computer.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.365
<i>Because there's nothing
on there.</i>

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.404
He told me
and I trust him.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.880
This is Howard
we're talking about.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.326
<i>I</i> gotta go.
<i>Okay.</i>

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.249
Get some rest, all right? I'll
see you at school tomorrow.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.522
Oh, shit.
Right, graduation.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.965
I forgot.
Oh, and, hey.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.846
I just wanted to say one more time, man.
Great tape.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.520
<i>I mean, I had no idea
that Annie was so flexible.</i>

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.250
Robby. Robby.
Yeah?

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.766
Maybe we should just stop
talking about this now.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.281
Yeah, yeah! Fair enough.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.931
Another time. Yeah.
Or, you know, never.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.926
Another time.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.444
Mom, thank you so much

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.409
for coming by
on such short notice.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.483
Oh, of course,
honey. Of course.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.841
Oh.
Thank you.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.968
Annie. ls everything
all right?

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.163
Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.926
And you and Jay?
You're okay?

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.685
Yeah, I think so.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.880
You sure you don't wanna
tell me what's goin' on?

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.081
Yes, I'm sure.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.844
Maybe some other time.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.481
Never

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.084
There's some things that I
really wanna share with you,

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.247
and then,
there's some things.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.129
That you should die
just never knowing

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.611
Okay, sounds good.
Okay.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.131
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ!

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.851
Hi. You can't keep
doing that to me.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.841
What are you doing, Jay?

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.964
I have really good news.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.361
Great news.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.929
I remote wiped
the mailman's iPad.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.844
I erased his iPad
from my computer.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.490
You can do that?
Yes, you can.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.041
We did it.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.884
So, yeah.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.480
In a way it would've been nice to
have that information earlier.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.006
In another, more
important way,

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.529
it's great news
that we have

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.807
remote wiped
the mailman's iPad.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.041
Yeah, it's good news.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.721
What's the bad news?

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.087
What?

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.003
$25,000?

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.362
Where we gonna get...
We don't have $25,000!

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.842
We're not giving it to Howard!
We're not. It's insane.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.686
We're gonna let
this little freak show

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.966
just post it up
on the Internet

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.690
for the entire world to see?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.526
People that we know?
People we don't know?

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.960
God, my gynecologist
is gonna be so

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.490
Okay.
Disappointed in me.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.926
The deli guy's gonna see
what we did with the salami!

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.479
Babe, can I say
something that's gonna

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.124
sound kinda crazy,
but just go with me?

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.844
All right? I've been
watching a bunch of

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.001
these videos online,

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.242
and you cannot
really tell

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:27.560
who these people are.
Mostly.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.880
And I'm sure
that they all have

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.127
somebody that they don't
want seeing their videos,

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.439
but they make them anyway.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.203
Like this one video I saw,

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:35.770
"Corn-fed Cowgirl
Gets Milked."

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.723
There is no way that she
wanted her boss seeing that

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.640
because what happened there
seemed very personal.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.406
Your point is?
My point is,

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:46.801
if our video went up there,
God forbid,

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.087
does anybody even know
that it's us?

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.969
And if they did,

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.801
does it really matter
that much?

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.050
I mean, it might.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.482
The coke-bender Hank
Rosenbaum might not care.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.688
But the CEO of Piper
Brothers Hank Rosenbaum,

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.966
he might.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.087
Honey.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.004
Hank Rosenbaum
has an 11-inch

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.207
double-sided dildo
in his nightstand.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.729
Is it made by
Piper Brothers?

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.446
Look, my point is,

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.649
maybe everybody has an 11-inch
dildo in their nightstand.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.122
That's a beautiful metaphor, honey.
Thank you.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:30.805
I thought of it just then.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.202
Maybe we don't care
so much

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:36.089
about what
other people think.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.966
I have an idea.

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:41.448
What? We haven't even
seen this video yet.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.930
There's no chance
I'm watchin' it.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.684
You don't have to.
I'll watch it.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.250
And at least,
then, we'll know

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.243
what we're actually
dealing with.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.641
Here we go.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.764
We gotta get this thing
off the fucking Internet!

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.921
Why? What?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.240
I saw it! That's us.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.845
That's definitely us.
Very clearly.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.042
That camera's fuckin' amazing.
Oh, my God!

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.201
Remember that thing
I told you about porn?

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.964
About how you see
right past the guy?

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.565
Well, I saw him
and it's me

01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.926
and it's fucking horrible!

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.048
It's like the worst picture
of yourself ever.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.804
Except you're fucking
for hours.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:04.922
What about me?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.081
You? You're a fucking
sexpot

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.208
I've told you this.
Total wank material.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.645
And now you're gonna be
in the fucking cloud!

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.846
Oh, my God.
We have to do something.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.604
We need 25 grand
to pay off Howard.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.409
Hell no! Fuck Howard!
I have another idea.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.250
Okay. You said it
was on YouPorn, right?

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.760
We're gonna be on it.
Jesus Christ.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.080
I know, honey. We're not.
Relax, okay?

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.366
The Internet is not
a free-floating thing.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.647
It's on a server
somewhere.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.563
It's not like
it's an actual cloud.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.287
You knew that, right?

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.041
Yeah.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.729
Look, we find
a business address.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.405
It's probably in
the Valley somewhere.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.970
Most porn companies are.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.280
We're like 20 minutes from the
porn capital of the world.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.044
Well, then what do we do?

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.645
I don't know. I mean,

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.371
it's probably just
a few guys with computers.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.721
We'll beg 'em

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.006
or bribe 'em or something.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.731
That's a great idea.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.446
What do we do
with the kids?

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.045
We can't call
my mom again.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.085
Up here, make a right.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.846
I think this is it.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.251
Hello? Open up!

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.881
Hello! Is anyone there?

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.611
This is the last time I'm gonna ask.
Is anyone home?

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.609
Hey! Hey, bud!

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.967
Hey! How's it goin', man?

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.764
We're just having
a little adventure.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.001
What's the adventure?

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.327
It's kind of, like, what?
Like, a scavenger hunt.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.323
You know what it is?
It's a game.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.289
Uh-huh.
And it is called,

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.965
Breaking and Entering.
What?

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.011
Okay, great.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.801
Shh.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.566
Hello?

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.971
Hello?

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.969
What are we
looking for?

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.400
That's a good question.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.130
Yeah, we're not
exactly sure.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.045
"Central Data Core."

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.200
- This is it.
- Let's do it.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.520
I think I might've
underestimated

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.005
the size of YouPorn.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.642
Yeah,
it's a bit bigger

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.960
than you would think.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.366
Jay! My God,
what have we done?

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.841
We're gonna go
to jail, Jay!

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.760
We should get outta here.
Yeah. We should go!

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.166
May I help you?

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.402
Okay.
You guys stay here. Okay?

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.561
Okay-

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.560
May I ask what the
fuck is goin' on here?

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.726
May I ask if you're
the proprietor

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.087
of this institution?

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.685
"Institution?"

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.364
Yeah. I'm that
motherfucker.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.731
And you've just made
a very serious mistake.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.201
Where are you from, huh?
You from Hustler?

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.131
Um...
Huh?

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.447
No.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.488
Which crew you runnin' with?
Xtube?

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.170
Is that it? No?
RedTube?

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.570
Bangbros?
No.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.245

No.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.401
BigBoobAlert?

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.365
You with BigBoobAlert?
Nope.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.409
Where you from, then?
You tell me right now.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.686
Wait, no, don't tell me.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.126
- MassageCreep?
- No.

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:49.725
We're not from MassageCreep.
No, no.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.921
KungPaoPussy?

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.127
No.
No.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.725
You from BeaverBong?
Tugjobs?

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.410
TrannySurprise?
Nutflix?

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.403
- No, ma'am.
- RealityKings?

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.562
NaughtyAmerica?
Euro-Angels? AsianAngels?

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.728
SeducedByACougar?
FuckStarTV?

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.366
Huh? Those cunts?
Not us.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.085
SubmitYourBitch?
No, sir.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.366
Wankspider?
No.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.607
MonkeyCum?

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.081
Honey, what's that one that Larry runs?
AThousandCumShots?

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.446
MonstersOfCock?
No.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.090
You with LadyBonersHD?

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.287
ButtholeSandwich.com?

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.602
Sir, we are in no way affiliated
with ButtholeSandwich.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.000
You one of them
assholes

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.286
from BigTittyCreamPie.com?

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.841
- No.
- No.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.445
<i>Not Playboy.</i>

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.131
Did Hugh send you?

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.049
Listen, sir. If you could just
give me one minute to explain.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.326
I know...
See, this is the thing.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.323
You've put me
in a position

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.767
where my only options
are to beat your ass,

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.166
or call the goddamn cops.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.847
Okay, sir, I see where
you're coming from...

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.207
Actually, I think we should beat
their ass and call the goddamn cops.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.487
I was thinkin'
the same shit.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.127
Look, if you want
to kick my ass, fine.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.965
And if you want to
call the cops, so be it.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.487
But there is a reason that we
did this, and it's because

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.130
sometimes people do some really crazy
shit to protect their families.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.651
And that's what happened.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.370
We did some crazy shit.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.801
We're really sorry.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.166
We're really sorry.
We're honestly...

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.321
It was for our family.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.561
You motherfuckers.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.880
You made a sex tape

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.241
and now you're tryin' to get
it off my server.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.521
Daddy, can I pet
the doggies?

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.522
No, we can't pet
these doggies.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:18.966
What are your
freakin' names?

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.364
I'm Jay.
Annie.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.850
Annie and Jay?
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.209
You the Annie
that writes

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.327
"Who's Yo Mommy?"

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.521
Yeah.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.285
- I love your blog.
- You do?

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.289
I read it all the time.
Oh, that's so great.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.084
I mean, the way
you write about

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.286
motherhood and parenting.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.640
Your marriage.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.087
Oh, thank you.
How old are yours?

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.408
Oh, one's 18 months
and one's 52 months.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.360
Aw.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.640
Baby, it's Annie and Jay.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.324
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
Annie and Jay

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.721
are in deep motherfuckin' shit.
Shh.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.329
Baby.

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.529
All you had to do
was email me

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.329
and I would've taken
it down.

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.090
Do you have any idea
how many people

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.650
are makin' sex tapes
out there?

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.530
We get about 1,000
new ones every day.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.965
I don't need to be
puttin' up sex tapes

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.644
from people who don't want
their sex tapes up there.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.643
There's no shortage
of sex tapes.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.087
Okay? You didn't have to
break my fuckin' door!

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.725
We're just incredibly
sorry, sir,

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.211
and we will pay
for all the damages.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.731
Oh, yes, you will. Today.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.170
And you will be
incredibly grateful

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.765
that I feel sorry
for your asses

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.410
and that my wife
likes your blog.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.881
No, we are very,
very grateful.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.291
Super grateful.
Thank you.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.521
It is great of you.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.126
Internet porn gets
a bad rap in some circles,

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.531
but it's not deserved.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.161
I'm always tellin' people this.
YouPorn is a community.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.607
A safe, supportive place
where people can go

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.883
to display videos of themselves
ass-fucking each other.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.208
That's really nice.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.321
It's wonderful.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.210
I think so.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.921
But let me
ask you something.

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.969
Why'd you make the video
in the first place

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.804
if you didn't want
anyone to see it?

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.530
I mean, I know
why you did it.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:59.726
But what about you?

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.127
It was my idea, actually.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.206
I just guess it was something
different, you know.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.441
Something new.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.126
Yeah, that's what I thought.
"Something new."

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.643
Let me tell you somethin'. I've
see a lot of fuckin' sex tapes.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.046
It's not something
people do

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.929
when everything's
goin' great.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.204
It's what you do
when you've lost track

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.282
of why you're fuckin'
in the first place.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.080
It's a quick fix.

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.765
But it doesn't solve
anything.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.321
And a lot of times it just
hides bigger problems.

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.608
Look at Paris Hilton
and Ricky Salomon.

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.330
Pamela Anderson
and Tommy Lee.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.488
Pamela Anderson
and Bret Michaels.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:39.483
Vince Neil
and Janine Lindemulder.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.642
Janine Lindemulder and me.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.129
All of these relationships
had bigger problems.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.721
They all forgot
why they were fuckin'

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.370
in the first place.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.688
Anyway,

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.162
that'll be roughly $15,000.
How would you like to pay?

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.485
I think that
went pretty well.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.449
I know.
He was so nice.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.490
Oh, my God.
What time is it?

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.921
We have to be at school
for graduation at 9:00.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.320
We have to get ready,
you guys.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.681
I gotta gel my hair.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.649
Come on! Come on,
come on, come on!

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:25.569
<i>♪ I don't wanna be
so complicated</i>

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.642
Go, go, go!
We got this!

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.206
<i>♪ Down in a new river</i>

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.363
Okay, babes.
Eat up, eat up, eat up.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.209
Through the thing
and magically, barn!

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.361
Let's see it.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.281
Pretty good.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.366
Hairbrush!

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.124
<i>♪ A simple new life ♪</i>

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.201
Okay, let's go.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.210
But I gotta
get this on.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.328
Put it on in the car.
Go, go!

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.561
Whoa!

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.201
I gotta go backstage.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.481
Go. Go graduate, pal.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.369
- We love ya.
- Bye.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.084
Mommy, I'm gonna go
find my class, okay?

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.161
Okay, honey.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.368
All right. We'll catch ya after.
See ya. Bye!

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.286
Hey, there we go.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.521
Okay. Oh, great.
Perfect.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.321
Sorry.

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.525
We made it.
Yeah.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.320
We got 'em all back.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.321
I mean, we may have to steal
Howard's computer later.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.885
But how hard
can that be?

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.246
Hi.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.444
I don't think
I'm ever gonna be able

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.045
to look at Robby
the same way again.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.569
I'm pretty sure
the feeling is mutual,

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.800
if that helps at all.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.565
I love you.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.121
I love you, too.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:11.520
No. I mean it.

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:12.721
Like, not in the way

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.450
that we say it to
each other all the time.

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.286
I mean, I really love you.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.570
And I'm also really
sorry about the video,

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.130
if I hadn't said that
already.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.800
Thank you.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.486
You hadn't.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.291
In a way, though,
I'm also

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.640
really glad
that it happened.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.881
'Cause I was thinkin' about

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:29.961
what you said at Hank's.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.441
You said that
a thing like this,

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.645
like "the video incident,"

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.882
reveals a lot
about a person.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.326
And you're right.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.322
And you know what it
revealed about you?

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.609
You are generous.

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.000
You're kind.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.811
You're imaginative.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.360
You always remember
what's important.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.130
You're ready for anything.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.282
You're a bit of a lightweight
when it comes to cocaine.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.125
But I think that
is a great quality.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.161
I just think that
you're really amazing.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.763
That's why I'm fuckin' you
in the first place.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.446
Oh...

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.809
You know what this
revealed about you?

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.366
It revealed that
you would do anything

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.922
to get those iPads
back for me.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.800
And there is no one
I would rather be with

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.530
when the shit hits the fan.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.161
God, I lucked out.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.326
I lucked out.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:30.160
I fucking love you.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.285
Excuse me. Public place.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.131
Oh, hi, Mom.
Excuse me. Hi.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.645
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.041
<i>Let's all settle in
and find a seat.</i>

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.806
<i>My name is Principal
Rodriguez and I would like</i>

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.291
to welcome everyone

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.290
<i>to our fourth-grade
graduation ceremony.</i>

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.130
<i>First up,
I'd like to introduce</i>

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.680
<i>our video yearbook maestro,</i>

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.365
<i>Clive Hargrove.
Yeah!</i>

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.970
Whoo!

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.483
<i>This is a video I made</i>

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.722
<i>showing the amazing
year we had.</i>

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.248
<i>Taking pictures and videos
is really important</i>

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.563
<i>Because it reminds us</i>

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.085
<i>what's really important</i>

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.890
Aw...

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.767
<i>and all the amazing
times we had.</i>

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.606
<i>So now I present to you our
fourth-grade video yearbook.</i>

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.721
You erased the video off
of our computer, right?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.331
Right, Jay?

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.209
Is it Video 1
or Movie 1?

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.725
Video 1, I think.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.889
I love you. Call 911.
Okay.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.847
It's Video 1.
No, wait, it's Movie 1.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.610
No! It's not Movie 1.

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:47.966
Wait, is it
the most recent one?

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.760
Yeah,
No! the most recent one.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:52.122
What's Frankensync?
Hurry, honey, hurry.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.807
It's okay. it was the right thing to do.
He's fine.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.769
Shit. Are you okay?

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.404
I'm not okay, man.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.970
Okay. Uh, uh...

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.724
Why doesn't Tess
bring you to the hospital

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.564
and I'll just make sure
your computer's okay.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.925
Dude!
That's insane.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.403
You take him
to the hospital.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.970
I will make sure
the computer's okay.

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.084
No, wait,
I feel like I'm being...

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.446
Careful, careful,
careful.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.720
- Hey, guys.
- Hmm?

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.768
Let's just take
a minute and acknowledge

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.769
that we have a lot
to celebrate.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.327
Your mom gettin' an offer on her blog.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.086
I'll get it. So why did
you jump off the balcony?

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.085
I told you, sweetie.
I tripped.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.480
That's why
it's very important

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.921
to always use the railings,

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.167
and to label
your videos properly.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.280
Can I go get some ice cream
with Howard and Marta?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.047
Um...

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.930
No.
Why not?

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.444
Because it's family night.

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.610
And after this I think we
should all go get some donuts.

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.968
And maybe laser tag.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.525
- Awesome.
- Are you sure?

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.648
You can barely
move over there.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.801
She's right.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.440
I'm sure.

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.404
Howard.
Jay.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.051
We told you,
Clive is busy tonight.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.805
A moment, please.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.128
So? I see what
you're up to, asshole.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.203
I have no idea what you're
talkin' about, Howard.

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.845
Withholding Clive.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.722
Looks like I might have
some moves of my own.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.166
Might wanna
watch your back.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:43.960
Are you threatening me, Jay?

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.482
I ain't payin' you shit,
motherfucker.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:47.971
Have you seen what
I'm capable of?

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.969
I jumped off
a fuckin' balcony.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.320
You do not
want to cross me.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.483
I don't care anymore. And that
makes me fuckin' dangerous.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.411
Yeah, boy.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.446
This is the last copy

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.249
of your stupid tape.
All right?

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.004
I deleted all
of the other copies.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.401
Why should I believe you?

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.166
Doin' it for Clive.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.845
To protect him.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.411
Can't have this
shit out there,

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.170
so I'm makin' a sacrifice.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.285
Plus, he's kinda
my only friend

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.845
and I really wanna
hang out with him.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.363
I can respect
that decision.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.006
Believe me, Jay.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.411
This is harder to
give back to you

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.845
than you could
ever imagine.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.365
Yeah. It's a good move,
though.

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.120
Let go of
the fuckin' thing.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.601
I'll be by tomorrow.

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.281
I'll see ya then,
you fuckin' weirdo.

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.889
That's it?
Yep.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.125
That's the last copy.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.007
Okay?

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.481
Hmm?

01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.566
Wait!

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.803
Just this once?
Just this once.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.405
And we don't even have to
watch the whole thing.

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.721
We can just skip around a little bit.
Okay? Mm-hmm.

And then you lick
my armpit.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.922
Really? Mm-hmm.
That's what it says.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.081
