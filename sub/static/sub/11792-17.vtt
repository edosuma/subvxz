WEBVTT

00:05.100 --> 00:06.167
I was seeing the future of

00:06.235 --> 00:08.603
Medicine.

00:08.670 --> 00:09.370
Plastic surgery?

00:09.438 --> 00:11.873
The wave of the future.

00:11.940 --> 00:12.840
Tell me what you don't like

00:12.908 --> 00:13.841
About yourself.

00:13.909 --> 00:14.709
My ass.

00:14.776 --> 00:15.543
My eyes.

00:15.611 --> 00:16.511
My knees.

00:16.578 --> 00:17.378
Your knees?

00:17.446 --> 00:18.679
Everything.

00:22.117 --> 00:23.217
Your right eye is half a

00:23.285 --> 00:24.552
Millimeter higher than your

00:24.620 --> 00:26.521
Left. i'll give you botox here

00:26.588 --> 00:28.589
And here. the breasts could go

00:28.657 --> 00:30.391
One size bigger. and finish off

00:30.459 --> 00:32.692
With some abdominal lipo.

00:33.962 --> 00:35.396
Would you have to fix

00:35.464 --> 00:36.631
Anything?

00:36.698 --> 00:38.065
Liposuction right here.

00:38.133 --> 00:39.867
Now, your boobs, lift them just

00:39.935 --> 00:44.405
A little bit. here... and here.

00:44.473 --> 00:46.574
You are a model of physical

00:46.642 --> 00:47.675
Perfection.

00:47.743 --> 00:48.910
But i can be better.

00:48.977 --> 00:50.411
I've identified these as my

00:50.479 --> 00:51.412
Problem areas.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.580
Diet? is that what we tell the

00:52.648 --> 00:53.581
20 people a week who come in

00:53.649 --> 00:55.082
Here? we're in the quick fix

00:55.150 --> 00:57.285
Biz.

00:57.352 --> 00:58.419
I think you could go up to a

00:58.487 --> 00:59.787
Double "d. " a "c. "

00:59.855 --> 01:01.856
Can i go bigger? ohh!

01:06.395 --> 01:08.129
I want to do whatever it

01:08.196 --> 01:10.464
Takes to be beautiful.

01:12.935 --> 01:15.536
Beauty is symmetry, and you

01:15.604 --> 01:18.172
Don't have any.

01:24.680 --> 01:25.546
Tell us what you don't like

01:25.614 --> 01:27.715
About yourselves. is that what

01:27.783 --> 01:30.318
You still ask all your consults?

01:30.385 --> 01:32.119
Well done. you remembered.

01:32.187 --> 01:33.120
Yeah.

01:33.188 --> 01:34.655
Do you remember us?

01:34.723 --> 01:37.558
Of course. uh, maureen and

01:37.626 --> 01:41.195
Marshall ayres from miami.

01:41.263 --> 01:43.097
You first came to see us in '02,

01:43.165 --> 01:43.898
Right?

01:43.966 --> 01:45.199
Yeah, yeah, yeah. real estate

01:45.267 --> 01:46.701
Brokers, right? "if you want

01:46.768 --> 01:48.502
Someone who cares, buy your home

01:48.570 --> 01:49.570
From ayres. "

01:49.638 --> 01:50.571
Ah!

01:50.639 --> 01:51.806
Yeah, we figured that getting

01:51.873 --> 01:53.574
Dual facelifts would help to

01:53.642 --> 01:55.509
Boost our business back then.

01:55.577 --> 01:56.811
The housing market was so hot,

01:56.878 --> 01:58.579
You know, you needed to do

01:58.647 --> 01:59.747
Anything you could to compete.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.349
Image was everything, and

02:01.416 --> 02:03.017
Projecting success meant looking

02:03.085 --> 02:03.851
Younger.

02:03.919 --> 02:04.852
Of course. and those are

02:04.920 --> 02:06.654
Ours, too, aren't they?

02:06.722 --> 02:09.624
Yep. oh, and...

02:09.691 --> 02:11.459
My calf implants. heh heh.

02:11.526 --> 02:12.660
They still look great.

02:12.728 --> 02:13.661
Don't they?

02:13.729 --> 02:14.662
Yeah.

02:14.730 --> 02:15.696
Huh?

02:15.764 --> 02:16.697
So what brings you to los

02:16.765 --> 02:17.698
Angeles?

02:17.766 --> 02:18.699
You guys.

02:18.767 --> 02:19.700
Ok, what were you thinking?

02:19.768 --> 02:21.168
Maybe a feather lift, or remove

02:21.236 --> 02:22.370
Some of the puffiness around the

02:22.437 --> 02:24.372
Eyes?

02:24.439 --> 02:27.074
We want you to, um...

02:27.142 --> 02:31.078
Reverse everything.

02:31.146 --> 02:32.713
You guys sold us a bad bill of

02:32.781 --> 02:35.483
Goods.

02:35.550 --> 02:37.385
So let me get this straight.

02:37.452 --> 02:39.186
You want us to undo your

02:39.254 --> 02:40.388
Facelifts.

02:40.455 --> 02:42.056
And take out the implants.

02:42.124 --> 02:43.190
So you can look worse.

02:43.258 --> 02:45.893
So we can look real.

02:45.961 --> 02:48.062
Forgive me, but for your ages

02:48.130 --> 02:49.730
You both look pretty good.

02:49.798 --> 02:50.731
Pretty good? i think they

02:50.799 --> 02:52.133
Look great. the real issue is

02:52.200 --> 02:53.234
Not about undoing anything,

02:53.301 --> 02:54.435
It's about teaching you about

02:54.503 --> 02:55.569
The techniques that we use

02:55.637 --> 02:56.404
Today.

02:56.471 --> 02:57.738
You don't get it. it's not

02:57.806 --> 02:59.240
About refining a procedure,

02:59.307 --> 03:01.342
It's the whole concept.

03:01.410 --> 03:03.110
Look, back in the 1940s,

03:03.178 --> 03:04.712
Doctors recommended cigarettes

03:04.780 --> 03:06.514
To their patients to calm them

03:06.581 --> 03:08.349
Down. now look what we know

03:08.417 --> 03:10.017
About those cancer sticks.

03:10.085 --> 03:11.052
It's no djfferent.

03:11.119 --> 03:12.520
Nobody ever died from looking

03:12.587 --> 03:13.688
Too young or looking too

03:13.755 --> 03:14.855
Beautiful. if you want to take

03:14.923 --> 03:15.856
Them out, that's fine.

03:15.924 --> 03:16.824
Do whatever you gotta, ok?

03:16.892 --> 03:17.825
But it's not gonna cost you any

03:17.893 --> 03:18.993
Less than it did when we put

03:19.061 --> 03:19.994
Them in.

03:20.062 --> 03:21.228
We were hoping there would be

03:21.296 --> 03:23.664
No charge.

03:23.732 --> 03:25.900
Our business has dropped

03:25.967 --> 03:30.104
Over 50% in the last 3 years,

03:30.172 --> 03:32.006
Just because of how we look.

03:32.074 --> 03:33.841
We used to be the faces you

03:33.909 --> 03:35.509
Could trust. but with this

03:35.577 --> 03:37.011
Tightness, we look like we're

03:37.079 --> 03:38.212
Just advertising our own

03:38.280 --> 03:39.580
Self-loathing.

03:39.648 --> 03:41.682
Would you buy a house from

03:41.750 --> 03:42.883
Someone like that?

03:42.951 --> 03:44.351
We made the choice to get the

03:44.419 --> 03:45.853
Work done, but we were led to

03:45.921 --> 03:47.521
Believe that society accepted

03:47.589 --> 03:50.357
It. you know, the times they are

03:50.425 --> 03:52.359
A- changing, and if you guys

03:52.427 --> 03:54.695
Don't keep up, you're gonna get

03:54.763 --> 03:58.299
Swept away just like us.

04:03.371 --> 04:06.240
Oh, sean. christian, would

04:06.308 --> 04:08.809
You grow up, for god sakes?!

04:08.877 --> 04:11.312
For god sakes.

04:13.215 --> 04:16.817
Dr. cruz?

04:16.885 --> 04:20.154
Hi. i'm daniella creighton.

04:20.221 --> 04:21.322
Your friendly drug dealer.

04:21.389 --> 04:22.323
Oh, right, right, right,

04:22.390 --> 04:23.157
Right.

04:23.225 --> 04:24.258
Very cute.

04:24.326 --> 04:25.259
Chicken?

04:25.327 --> 04:27.828
I think it's a turkey.

04:27.896 --> 04:30.331
Uh, so what's the, uh, new

04:30.398 --> 04:31.999
Groundbreaking anesthesia i must

04:32.067 --> 04:33.000
Have?

04:33.068 --> 04:34.702
Sunedra. prospropofol

04:34.770 --> 04:36.203
Disodium. and it converts into

04:36.271 --> 04:39.507
Propofol once inside the body.

04:39.574 --> 04:41.008
Ok, well, hit me. why is

04:41.076 --> 04:42.843
Sunedra better, in 10 words or

04:42.911 --> 04:43.844
Less?

04:43.912 --> 04:45.679
Uh, eliminates negative

04:45.747 --> 04:48.048
After-effects of general

04:48.116 --> 04:54.221
Anesthesia 89% of... time.

04:54.289 --> 04:55.823
You just made it.

04:55.891 --> 04:57.658
was that 10?

04:57.726 --> 04:59.693
Yeah, that was 10.

04:59.761 --> 05:01.462
What is it, lizzie?

05:01.530 --> 05:02.963
We came as soon as we heard

05:03.031 --> 05:03.964
Your shriek.

05:04.032 --> 05:04.965
Does this belong to you?

05:05.033 --> 05:06.133
I've never seen that turkey

05:06.201 --> 05:07.301
Before in my life.

05:07.369 --> 05:08.502
Dr. christian troy. how are you?

05:08.570 --> 05:09.503
Daniella creighton.

05:09.571 --> 05:10.504
Great.

05:10.572 --> 05:11.639
Penkala pharmaceuticals.

05:11.706 --> 05:12.973
Sean mcnamara. it's nice to

05:13.041 --> 05:13.974
Meet you.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.643
It's nice to meet you, too.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.478
I've got some great discounts.

05:17.546 --> 05:19.280
Uh, two of our best clients

05:19.347 --> 05:20.614
Recently took early retirement,

05:20.682 --> 05:22.149
So we're overstocked.

05:22.217 --> 05:23.651
Really? anybody we know?

05:23.718 --> 05:25.486
Dr. chaiken and dr. gaines.

05:25.554 --> 05:27.321
Chuck gaines? jesus, he's

05:27.389 --> 05:28.322
Younger than i am.

05:28.390 --> 05:29.957
I think he got depressed.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.458
He kept saying how plastic

05:31.526 --> 05:32.827
Surgery was over and he didn't

05:32.894 --> 05:34.128
Want to be the last one to turn

05:34.196 --> 05:35.729
The lights out.

05:35.797 --> 05:38.132
So, will you take a look at the

05:38.200 --> 05:39.133
Clinical tests results and get

05:39.201 --> 05:40.134
Back to me?

05:40.202 --> 05:41.502
I sure will.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.003
Even if it's a no.

05:43.071 --> 05:44.004
I will.

05:44.072 --> 05:45.172
It was really nice meeting

05:45.240 --> 05:46.006
You.

05:46.074 --> 05:47.007
It was really nice meeting

05:47.075 --> 05:48.175
You.

05:48.243 --> 05:49.343
Yeah, see you.

05:49.411 --> 05:50.845
Ciao.

05:50.912 --> 05:53.347
Wow.

05:53.415 --> 05:55.416
Was she really coming on to me.

05:55.483 --> 05:56.517
She was wearing a wedding

05:56.585 --> 05:57.351
Ring, liz.

05:57.419 --> 05:58.185
Yeah, so?

05:58.253 --> 05:59.687
Married women have flirted with

05:59.754 --> 06:02.356
Me before. i mean, you know,

06:02.424 --> 06:03.858
It's called bi-curious.

06:03.925 --> 06:05.025
It's called buy my stuff.

06:05.093 --> 06:06.126
You know, i don't think she

06:06.194 --> 06:07.962
Was here just to... sell me

06:08.029 --> 06:09.330
Drugs.

06:09.397 --> 06:11.298
I mean, after 30 years of being

06:11.366 --> 06:12.967
A lesbian, i think that i have

06:13.034 --> 06:14.134
Some instincts about these

06:14.202 --> 06:15.135
Things, you know.

06:15.203 --> 06:16.804
Fine. just be careful, ok?

06:16.872 --> 06:21.041
You only have one kidney left.

06:21.877 --> 06:25.145
Oh, you turkey.

06:25.213 --> 06:26.814
Wow. couples coming in to

06:26.882 --> 06:28.315
Have their plastic surgery

06:28.383 --> 06:30.050
Reversed. doctors like gaines

06:30.118 --> 06:31.418
Closing their doors. this might

06:31.486 --> 06:33.053
Be a trend we're looking at.

06:33.121 --> 06:34.688
Jesus, one couple and a

06:34.756 --> 06:37.825
Retiree and you start to panic.

06:37.893 --> 06:39.393
I'm just saying it might be

06:39.461 --> 06:40.895
Smart to diversify, maybe bring

06:40.962 --> 06:42.396
On a dermatologist, do more

06:42.464 --> 06:43.397
Fillers.

06:43.465 --> 06:44.832
You ever eaten at lawry's?

06:44.900 --> 06:46.166
It didn't change its menu when

06:46.234 --> 06:47.668
The rest of the country decided

06:47.736 --> 06:48.836
To change its eating habits.

06:48.904 --> 06:50.337
It stuck with what it did best,

06:50.405 --> 06:52.273
Right? meats, potatoes, salads.

06:52.340 --> 06:54.008
Plastic surgery will die when

06:54.075 --> 06:55.175
People begin to look at

06:55.243 --> 06:56.477
Themselves for beauty and

06:56.544 --> 06:58.012
Self-esteem. and a herd of geese

06:58.079 --> 07:00.781
Will fly up my ass.

No.

Never?

07:57.304 --> 07:58.304
No.

07:58.372 --> 08:00.306
You drink, though. looking at

08:00.374 --> 08:02.108
Your face, i'd say you're a

08:02.176 --> 08:04.143
3- scotch-a-night man.

08:04.211 --> 08:05.978
This crepey area here-

08:06.046 --> 08:08.281
Dehydration.

08:08.349 --> 08:09.482
Nothing turns you into an old

08:09.550 --> 08:10.550
Man faster.

08:10.617 --> 08:12.452
I can see i need some help.

08:12.519 --> 08:14.520
What is your plan?

08:14.588 --> 08:16.022
Let's start with 15cc of

08:16.090 --> 08:19.592
Cosmoderm in the lip les.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.394
Been feeling a little bitter and

08:21.462 --> 08:23.930
Judgmental lately? now no one

08:23.997 --> 08:26.165
Will know what you're thinking.

08:26.233 --> 08:27.767
They'll just be drawn to your

08:27.835 --> 08:32.871
Positive, boyish charm.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.775
10cc of radiesse, bye-bye,

08:35.842 --> 08:37.809
Jowls.

08:37.878 --> 08:42.048
10cc of lidocaine...

08:42.116 --> 08:44.015
And definitely some botox.

08:46.854 --> 08:50.790
How amazing is that?

08:50.858 --> 08:53.559
Hmm. not bad.

08:53.627 --> 08:56.362
Stay there.

08:56.430 --> 08:58.564
I don't do this for everyone,

08:58.632 --> 09:03.870
But you are so cute.

09:03.937 --> 09:05.371
You don't feel the winds of

09:05.439 --> 09:06.873
Change.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.841
Plastic surgery is just not cool

09:08.909 --> 09:11.878
Anymore. we're being called to

09:11.945 --> 09:14.714
A higher purpose. people just

09:14.782 --> 09:17.884
Feel wrong about self-mutilation

09:17.951 --> 09:20.386
For youth and prestige. and who

09:20.454 --> 09:22.855
Has 2 weeks' recovery time?

09:22.923 --> 09:24.557
It is so 2004.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.058
So toxins and face fillers

09:26.126 --> 09:27.160
Are your higher purpose?

09:27.227 --> 09:29.996
What's yours? dare i ask?

09:30.063 --> 09:31.731
I haven't found it yet, but at

09:31.799 --> 09:33.900
The moment, i just mutilate

09:33.967 --> 09:36.569
People for youth and prestige.

09:38.872 --> 09:41.073
Call me the face of 2004.

09:43.043 --> 09:44.243
Did you have a chance to read

09:44.311 --> 09:45.411
The results from the clinical

09:45.479 --> 09:46.412
Trials?

09:46.480 --> 09:49.048
Um... no. i'm sorry, but i

09:49.116 --> 09:50.583
Have not.

09:50.651 --> 09:54.487
Mm.

09:54.555 --> 09:55.922
Listen, um...

09:55.989 --> 10:00.226
Dani.

10:03.163 --> 10:06.199
Uh, i feel very comfortable

10:06.266 --> 10:09.936
Staying with the propofol.

10:10.003 --> 10:12.939
I'm used to it, and, um...

10:13.006 --> 10:15.441
I'm just gonna stay with it.

10:15.509 --> 10:17.610
Ok, then.

10:17.678 --> 10:19.378
Well, it was nice to have met

10:19.446 --> 10:20.279
You.

10:20.347 --> 10:22.915
Very nice to meet you, too.

10:27.221 --> 10:29.956
You wouldn't want to...

10:30.023 --> 10:32.358
I don't know, um...

10:32.426 --> 10:34.727
Have lunch with me sometime,

10:34.795 --> 10:36.762
Would you?

10:36.830 --> 10:38.331
I promise, no shop talk.

10:38.398 --> 10:39.465
How do you think your

10:39.533 --> 10:44.470
Husband's gonna feel about that?

10:44.538 --> 10:48.441
We're... we're separated.

10:48.509 --> 10:53.312
But you're right. i'm sorry.

10:53.380 --> 10:56.849
I just-i have these thoughts...

10:56.917 --> 10:58.918
Fantasies, and i never act on

10:58.986 --> 11:01.087
Them, but... you just-you seem

11:01.154 --> 11:02.021
So-

11:02.089 --> 11:05.424
Available?

11:05.492 --> 11:08.427
Beautiful.

11:08.495 --> 11:10.796
Oh, god.

11:10.864 --> 11:12.598
I'm so sorry. i'm just-i'm

11:12.666 --> 11:15.668
Going through a phase.

11:21.074 --> 11:23.509
I don't eat lunch.

11:26.680 --> 11:27.880
We always have a lot of yogurt

11:27.948 --> 11:32.752
Here. on the other hand...

11:32.819 --> 11:37.590
I'm very partial to dinner.

11:37.658 --> 11:43.262
Roberta flack: * the first time

11:43.330 --> 11:48.401
Ever i saw your face... *

11:48.468 --> 11:49.435
I'm never gonna have a

11:49.503 --> 11:50.937
Facelift. botox maybe, but no

11:51.004 --> 11:52.104
Facelifts.

11:52.172 --> 11:53.272
That's the reason you're only

11:53.340 --> 11:54.173
An anesthesiologist, lizzie,

11:54.241 --> 11:55.274
And not a successful surgeon

11:55.342 --> 11:58.177
Like myself. ok? you're not

11:58.245 --> 11:59.211
Willing to go the distance.

11:59.279 --> 12:00.413
You're dead wrong,

12:00.480 --> 12:01.380
Smartypants.

12:01.448 --> 12:02.381
The reason i became an

12:02.449 --> 12:03.950
Anesthesiologist is so that i

12:04.017 --> 12:05.451
Could switch my specialties

12:05.519 --> 12:06.886
Whenever i wanted. call me in a

12:06.954 --> 12:07.887
Year when you're standing over

12:07.955 --> 12:09.622
An empty operating table and i'm

12:09.690 --> 12:11.123
Making bank over the heart

12:11.191 --> 12:13.626
Institute at cedars.

12:13.694 --> 12:15.027
Oh, look who's here.

12:15.095 --> 12:16.662
Fancypants, huh? oh, you look

12:16.730 --> 12:17.964
Good. maybe too good. get an

12:18.031 --> 12:18.764
Extra hour's sleep? is that why

12:18.832 --> 12:19.765
You're late?

12:19.833 --> 12:20.866
Yeah, you look like a

12:20.934 --> 12:21.701
Different person, huh?

12:21.768 --> 12:22.702
Well, i went to see jill

12:22.769 --> 12:23.903
Jacobson yesterday.

12:23.971 --> 12:25.004
I sampled from her injectibles

12:25.072 --> 12:26.005
Menu.

12:26.073 --> 12:27.039
Why the hell did you go to

12:27.107 --> 12:28.040
Her? we can do anything she does

12:28.108 --> 12:29.041
And better.

12:29.109 --> 12:30.042
Dermatologists specialize in

12:30.110 --> 12:31.377
That kind of treatment, and

12:31.445 --> 12:32.378
Frankly, they do a much better

12:32.446 --> 12:33.379
Job.

12:33.447 --> 12:35.181
Fine, ok? but when the stuff

12:35.248 --> 12:36.382
Wears off, i don't want you

12:36.450 --> 12:37.383
Going back to her. if anybody

12:37.451 --> 12:38.384
Should be stabbing you with a

12:38.452 --> 12:39.719
Needle, it's me and not the

12:39.786 --> 12:40.720
Competition.

12:40.787 --> 12:41.921
She's not the competition

12:41.989 --> 12:43.422
Anymore. i hired her this

12:43.490 --> 12:44.423
Morning.

12:44.491 --> 12:45.558
Huh. you can't hire anyone

12:45.626 --> 12:46.559
Without my approval.

12:46.627 --> 12:47.727
Don't worry, you'll love her.

12:47.794 --> 12:48.728
You're having dinner with her

12:48.795 --> 12:49.729
Tomorrow night.

13:10.104 --> 13:11.672
Christian troy?

13:11.739 --> 13:12.673
That's me.

13:12.740 --> 13:13.840
Have a seat. we're running a

13:13.908 --> 13:16.209
Little behind today.

13:16.277 --> 13:18.312
Hmm.

13:29.590 --> 13:33.393
Hey.

13:33.461 --> 13:36.363
Hmm. are they always this busy?

13:36.431 --> 13:41.201
No. it's usually worse.

13:41.269 --> 13:42.703
So you come here quite a bit,

13:42.770 --> 13:43.704
Then?

13:43.771 --> 13:44.705
Every 6 weeks.

13:44.772 --> 13:46.873
Wow.

13:46.941 --> 13:48.842
That must be awful.

13:48.910 --> 13:50.544
No, it's not so bad. it's

13:50.611 --> 13:52.045
Just like getting a haircut.

13:52.113 --> 13:52.979
I meant wasting your time and

13:53.047 --> 13:53.980
Money on something that doesn't

13:54.048 --> 13:54.815
Work.

13:54.882 --> 13:55.816
I beg your pardon?

13:55.883 --> 13:56.817
You do realize that if you

13:56.884 --> 13:57.818
Only use injectibles, you'll

13:57.885 --> 14:01.488
Never be satisfied.

14:01.556 --> 14:02.989
Sure, there's the high of

14:03.057 --> 14:04.091
Looking good when you first get

14:04.158 --> 14:05.158
It done. but then you start

14:05.226 --> 14:06.493
Seeing the spots the doctor

14:06.561 --> 14:09.329
Missed right away.

14:09.397 --> 14:13.333
Like these lines, here.

14:13.401 --> 14:15.001
Of course, the doctor's only too

14:15.069 --> 14:16.503
Willing to squeeze you in.

14:16.571 --> 14:17.904
It's more money for her.

14:17.972 --> 14:19.005
Thank you for seeing me

14:19.073 --> 14:20.006
Again.

14:20.074 --> 14:22.175
Good to have you back.

14:22.243 --> 14:23.944
Just right here i noticed.

14:24.011 --> 14:25.178
Ok.

14:25.246 --> 14:26.513
You can't argue with the

14:26.581 --> 14:27.514
Results, though.

14:27.582 --> 14:28.515
If you're looking for real

14:28.583 --> 14:30.851
Value and long-lasting results,

14:30.918 --> 14:33.720
The only thing you can rely on

14:33.788 --> 14:36.556
Is a qualified surgeon.

14:36.624 --> 14:39.926
Take one.

14:39.994 --> 14:42.429
Great.

14:42.497 --> 14:43.997
Thank you.

14:52.006 --> 14:55.375
Lois, what happened here?

14:55.443 --> 14:57.310
I thought we were overbooked.

14:57.378 --> 14:59.713
They all got a better offer.

15:04.352 --> 15:05.652
How dare you get rid of my

15:05.720 --> 15:06.653
Patients like that.

15:06.721 --> 15:07.954
They left of their own free

15:08.022 --> 15:08.955
Will.

15:09.023 --> 15:10.223
Only after you fed them some

15:10.291 --> 15:11.491
Bullshit line about the marvels

15:11.559 --> 15:12.826
Of plastic surgery.

15:12.894 --> 15:14.661
Actually, it was an educated

15:14.729 --> 15:15.996
Decision based on years of

15:16.063 --> 15:18.832
Practice. of course, i didn't do

15:18.900 --> 15:20.500
A one-year course at a community

15:20.568 --> 15:23.837
College to become a beautician.

15:23.905 --> 15:25.839
so, i'm sure that i

15:25.907 --> 15:27.040
Missed out on some of the finer

15:27.108 --> 15:30.877
Points.

15:30.945 --> 15:33.513
Oh, i get it.

15:33.581 --> 15:35.315
This is some kind of test,

15:35.383 --> 15:37.150
To see what i'm made of before

15:37.218 --> 15:38.318
We start working together?

15:38.386 --> 15:39.352
Oh, we're not working

15:39.420 --> 15:40.954
Together, sweet cheeks.

15:41.022 --> 15:42.456
See, my partner needed my

15:42.523 --> 15:44.191
Approval for you to come aboard

15:44.258 --> 15:45.692
And i came to tell you that i

15:45.760 --> 15:46.893
Don't approve.

15:46.961 --> 15:48.028
Things are really bad, aren't

15:48.095 --> 15:49.029
They?

15:49.096 --> 15:50.030
Excuse me?

15:50.097 --> 15:53.266
The business. it must be.

15:53.334 --> 15:54.701
Or you wouldn't look like such

15:54.769 --> 15:55.702
Shit.

15:56.771 --> 15:58.038
I think you need my help.

15:58.105 --> 15:59.473
I got a better idea. you come

15:59.540 --> 16:00.640
To my office, and i'll help you

16:00.708 --> 16:01.641
Fill out that cleavage of yours.

16:01.709 --> 16:02.642
What are you, an "a" cup?

16:02.710 --> 16:04.644
Is that a problem for you?

16:04.712 --> 16:06.413
That and your pancake ass,

16:06.481 --> 16:10.517
But, um, we could fix that, too.

16:10.585 --> 16:15.322
Hmm. and, uh...

16:15.389 --> 16:19.092
What exactly would you do to my

16:19.160 --> 16:23.330
Ass, dr. troy?

16:23.397 --> 16:25.131
Why don't you just give us

16:25.199 --> 16:27.033
A quick look here, huh?

16:30.571 --> 16:32.339
This ass?

16:32.406 --> 16:34.174
There's a lot i could do with

16:34.242 --> 16:36.676
That. i could definitely take

16:36.744 --> 16:38.778
You up to a "c" cup.

16:38.846 --> 16:40.680
Should we lock the door?

16:40.748 --> 16:42.349
Why, huh? all your patients

16:42.416 --> 16:43.683
Are gone.

16:43.751 --> 16:44.851
Actually, there's probably

16:44.919 --> 16:46.520
Another 10 out there right now.

16:47.588 --> 16:49.022
See, i can book every 15

16:49.090 --> 16:52.192
Minutes for 8 hours.

16:52.260 --> 16:53.960
But since you're part of the old

16:54.028 --> 16:54.961
Guard...

16:56.030 --> 16:57.130
I guess you'll never get to

16:57.198 --> 16:58.298
Experience what i really had to

16:58.366 --> 17:02.936
Offer you. which was a future.

17:03.004 --> 17:04.804
Tell sean i said thanks for the

17:04.872 --> 17:08.808
Opportunity.

17:08.876 --> 17:10.977
I will. and if you change

17:11.045 --> 17:13.313
Your mind about the, uh, "c"

17:13.381 --> 17:18.551
Cup, you let me know.

17:20.555 --> 17:21.488
Shit!

17:21.556 --> 17:23.990
Just a minute.

17:27.694 --> 17:31.731
butterfingers.

17:31.799 --> 17:34.634
Come on in. come in.

17:34.702 --> 17:36.937
I'd keep your shoes on.

17:37.004 --> 17:37.938
Ok.

17:38.005 --> 17:38.939
Yeah.

17:40.675 --> 17:41.908
It's beautiful here, huh?

17:41.976 --> 17:45.145
Oh, thank you.

17:45.212 --> 17:46.846
So, would you like some wine?

17:46.914 --> 17:48.648
I- i got some white and some red

17:48.716 --> 17:50.350
That my husband brought back

17:50.418 --> 17:53.687
From napa. uh, he's an expert.

17:53.754 --> 17:55.455
I, uh, think he knew more about

17:55.523 --> 17:58.325
Wine than he knew about me.

17:58.392 --> 17:59.526
Oh, god, i didn't even ask if

17:59.594 --> 18:01.027
You drank. i just-i've heard

18:01.095 --> 18:02.228
That most lesbians are

18:02.296 --> 18:03.363
Alcoholics.

18:03.431 --> 18:05.966
Oh. well, i must be in the

18:06.033 --> 18:08.301
Super minority. um, i prefer

18:08.369 --> 18:09.302
Red.

18:09.370 --> 18:12.305
Me, too. isn't that wild?

18:12.373 --> 18:13.707
Yeah.

18:20.715 --> 18:21.648
Oh!

18:21.716 --> 18:23.149
Oh! can i use this?

18:23.217 --> 18:24.117
O god.

18:24.185 --> 18:25.619
God coming to the rescue.

18:25.686 --> 18:27.287
Oh, good.

18:29.256 --> 18:30.624
Is this your first date with

18:30.691 --> 18:31.625
A woman?

18:31.692 --> 18:32.626
Is it that obvious?

18:37.198 --> 18:38.365
Look, believe me, i'm not

18:38.432 --> 18:40.800
Just experimenting.

18:40.868 --> 18:44.604
I'm like 75% sure that i'm gay.

18:44.672 --> 18:49.776
75%, huh? hmm?

18:49.844 --> 18:52.646
I've, um... i've always been

18:52.713 --> 18:54.914
Attracted to women.

18:54.982 --> 18:59.386
And, um... it leaves the fact

18:59.453 --> 19:02.155
That in all the years with my

19:02.223 --> 19:08.728
Husband, i never once had, uh...

19:08.796 --> 19:09.729
I know.

19:09.797 --> 19:11.297
Hmm.

19:11.365 --> 19:14.134
Well, bottoms up.

19:15.202 --> 19:17.070
Oh, shit, i didn't mean that.

19:17.138 --> 19:18.905
The-

19:22.643 --> 19:25.445
Mmm.

19:33.487 --> 19:35.588
What you doin'?

19:35.656 --> 19:37.557
I'm taking care of the other

19:37.625 --> 19:40.360
25%.

19:58.813 --> 20:02.382
It's-it's just, um...

20:02.450 --> 20:05.452
I've never...

20:05.519 --> 20:08.188
And...

20:08.255 --> 20:09.289
I just-i don't want you to

20:09.356 --> 20:10.323
Expect too much.

20:10.391 --> 20:15.662
I don't expect anything. ok?

20:15.730 --> 20:16.930
I just want you to have a good

20:16.997 --> 20:18.798
Time. i don't care if you

20:18.866 --> 20:22.335
Orgasm. just trust me. it's

20:22.403 --> 20:26.139
Gonna be ok. all right?

20:26.207 --> 20:29.809
Ok.

20:29.877 --> 20:34.380
I trust you.

20:34.448 --> 20:35.982
Ohh...

20:39.887 --> 20:41.521
Ohh...

20:46.127 --> 20:48.995
Ohh...

20:49.063 --> 20:50.663
Ohh. ohh...

20:50.731 --> 20:52.766
Oh! ohh! ohh!

20:52.833 --> 20:53.833
Uhh! uhh!

20:55.136 --> 20:56.569
Sean, you might want to call

20:56.637 --> 20:57.570
Your little injectibles wench

20:57.638 --> 20:58.571
And tell her she won't be having

20:58.639 --> 20:59.773
A job here. i'm not budging on

20:59.840 --> 21:01.508
That one, by the way, so don't

21:01.575 --> 21:02.709
Tax you're already overworked

21:02.777 --> 21:04.077
Brain trying to come up with a

21:04.145 --> 21:05.912
Way to talk me out of it.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.080
Yeah, i think we're on the

21:07.148 --> 21:08.414
Same page about that.

21:08.482 --> 21:10.717
Wow! what happened to you?

21:10.785 --> 21:12.051
Too much filler.

21:12.119 --> 21:13.353
You went back a second time?

21:13.420 --> 21:14.354
And a third.

21:14.421 --> 21:15.355
A third?

21:15.422 --> 21:16.790
Yeah, laugh away, pal.

21:16.857 --> 21:17.791
You're gonna be doing the

21:17.858 --> 21:21.261
Correction. 5cc of hyaluronidase

21:21.328 --> 21:22.796
Wherever she injected me.

21:22.863 --> 21:24.430
So, fellas, i just got off

21:24.498 --> 21:25.932
The phone with a bernie

21:26.000 --> 21:27.433
Greenstein, who said that he's

21:27.501 --> 21:29.102
Representing the ayers, and they

21:29.170 --> 21:31.104
Are filing a lawsuit against us,

21:31.172 --> 21:33.606
Claiming loss of income due to

21:33.674 --> 21:34.607
Misrepresentation and

21:34.675 --> 21:35.742
Malpractice.

21:35.810 --> 21:37.911
Oh, my god, look at you.

21:37.978 --> 21:38.945
Who'd you piss off?

21:39.013 --> 21:40.280
Don't.

21:40.347 --> 21:41.514
Well, he's trying to get a

21:41.582 --> 21:43.116
Court order to see a list of

21:43.184 --> 21:44.651
Our patients, hoping that there

21:44.718 --> 21:46.019
Are more disgruntled folks.

21:46.086 --> 21:47.253
Bernie greendick is an

21:47.321 --> 21:48.955
Asshole. ok? and everything he

21:49.023 --> 21:50.623
Touches turns to tabloid, uh,

21:50.691 --> 21:51.791
Headlines, ok? so who gives a

21:51.859 --> 21:52.759
Shit?

21:52.827 --> 21:53.726
All right, could we put the

21:53.794 --> 21:54.727
Lawsuit aside and bring the

21:54.795 --> 21:55.628
Swelling down? please?

21:55.696 --> 21:57.130
You're wrong, sean. we have

21:57.198 --> 21:58.398
Plenty to worry about.

21:58.465 --> 21:59.899
All people need to do is hear

21:59.967 --> 22:01.067
The name mcnamara and troy in

22:01.135 --> 22:02.402
Context with a lawsuit and we're

22:02.469 --> 22:03.403
Screwed.

22:03.470 --> 22:05.905
Ow.

22:05.973 --> 22:07.240
No, no, no, we can't worry about

22:07.308 --> 22:08.741
That. there's nothing we can do.

22:08.809 --> 22:10.910
It's all over, anyway. the whole

22:10.978 --> 22:12.412
Pursuit of perfection is a

22:12.479 --> 22:14.080
Gigantic hoax. nothing changes.

22:14.148 --> 22:15.248
We need to put up a fight,

22:15.316 --> 22:16.916
All right? i'm gonna get a

22:16.984 --> 22:17.917
Feather lift and you're gonna

22:17.985 --> 22:19.319
Give it to me, and you're

22:19.386 --> 22:20.753
Gonna show the world what we

22:20.821 --> 22:21.754
Do here.

22:21.822 --> 22:23.256
Uh. ow. and that would do

22:23.324 --> 22:24.257
What, besides take you out of

22:24.325 --> 22:25.325
Surgery for a week?

22:25.392 --> 22:26.426
You'll be the poster boy for

22:26.493 --> 22:27.760
Injectibles, ok? i'll be the

22:27.828 --> 22:29.262
Face of the business and the

22:29.330 --> 22:31.764
Future of plastic surgery.

22:42.246 --> 22:44.181
All right, old man. you sure

22:44.248 --> 22:45.382
You're ready to do this?

22:46.349 --> 22:48.084
Hold on. i didn't get that.

22:48.151 --> 22:50.186
Wait. um, can you say your line

22:50.253 --> 22:51.654
Again for me, please?

22:51.722 --> 22:52.855
What are you doing?

22:52.923 --> 22:54.256
It's ok. she's filming this.

22:54.324 --> 22:55.691
I asked her to. we're gonna put

22:55.759 --> 22:56.992
The whole thing on youtube.

22:57.060 --> 22:58.194
The surgery?

22:58.261 --> 22:59.695
Yes. it's pioneering, just

22:59.763 --> 23:01.330
Like we used to be. any luck,

23:01.398 --> 23:02.798
This whole thing will go viral

23:02.866 --> 23:04.033
And the world will get to see

23:04.101 --> 23:06.135
Just how easy a facelift can be

23:06.203 --> 23:07.536
These days.

23:07.604 --> 23:08.537
Oh, yeah, that'll work.

23:08.605 --> 23:09.672
We get a half a million hits,

23:09.740 --> 23:11.173
You wait-we'll go from being

23:11.241 --> 23:13.175
Sued to being stars again.

23:13.243 --> 23:14.176
Yeah.

23:14.244 --> 23:16.112
Look. i know it

23:16.179 --> 23:17.079
Makes you a little anxious

23:17.147 --> 23:18.447
To be on camera.

23:18.515 --> 23:20.616
So just pretend it's not there.

23:20.684 --> 23:21.617
Ok?

23:21.685 --> 23:22.618
Ok.

23:22.686 --> 23:23.619
Ok. now say your line again.

23:23.687 --> 23:24.954
And do it good.

23:25.021 --> 23:26.889
Uh... are you sure you're

23:26.957 --> 23:29.058
Ready to do this?

23:29.126 --> 23:30.726
Absolu-absolutely, doc.

23:30.794 --> 23:32.394
heh heh.

23:32.462 --> 23:33.562
Let's operate.

23:33.630 --> 23:34.830
Music.

23:41.204 --> 23:42.271
Sweet dreams.

23:42.339 --> 23:44.440
All right... 10...

23:44.508 --> 23:46.742
9... 8...

23:46.810 --> 23:49.678
7... 6...

24:12.369 --> 24:13.869
Can you feel it? i mean, the

24:13.937 --> 24:15.571
Energy is just electrifying.

24:15.639 --> 24:16.972
And just think, in a few minutes

24:17.040 --> 24:18.440
We'll be at the end of an era,

24:18.508 --> 24:20.142
And everybody who is anybody who

24:20.210 --> 24:21.644
No longer looks the way they

24:21.711 --> 24:23.746
Used to will be here tonight.

24:23.814 --> 24:25.147
Speaking of that, look who is

24:25.215 --> 24:27.550
Here. it's dr. sean mcnamara.

24:27.617 --> 24:28.450
Sean!

24:28.518 --> 24:29.552
Hello. don't you look

24:29.619 --> 24:30.553
Dashing.

24:30.620 --> 24:31.487
Well, joan, when they told me

24:31.555 --> 24:32.655
That we'd be celebrating the

24:32.722 --> 24:33.989
Demise of plastic surgery

24:34.057 --> 24:35.324
Tonight, i knew i couldn't show

24:35.392 --> 24:36.325
Up in scrubs.

24:36.393 --> 24:37.493
and this is your

24:37.561 --> 24:38.327
Date?

24:38.395 --> 24:39.328
Yes. this is my new partner

24:39.396 --> 24:40.296
Curtis.

24:40.363 --> 24:41.797
Oh. i love your outfit.

24:41.865 --> 24:42.798
Well, thank you. my daughter

24:42.866 --> 24:43.799
Actually picked it out.

24:43.867 --> 24:45.301
Oh, hello. don't tell me.

24:45.368 --> 24:46.302
Valentino, right? crocodile

24:46.369 --> 24:48.938
Collection? i have the same

24:49.005 --> 24:50.239
Thing in my closet.

24:51.908 --> 24:52.908
Well, we should get going.

24:52.976 --> 24:54.910
We're already late as it is.

24:54.978 --> 24:56.078
Sean, wait!

24:58.815 --> 25:00.583
Ah! look who's here-the one

25:00.650 --> 25:01.817
Man who single-handedly

25:01.885 --> 25:03.252
Destroyed the fine art

25:03.320 --> 25:04.420
Of plastic surgery,

25:04.487 --> 25:06.422
Dr. christian troy. so what are

25:06.489 --> 25:07.489
You doing, doc, trying to crash

25:07.557 --> 25:08.424
The party?

25:08.491 --> 25:09.291
No, i have to stop-

25:09.359 --> 25:10.125
If anyone needs to be

25:10.193 --> 25:11.126
Stopped, doctor, i think it's

25:11.194 --> 25:12.561
You. maybe you'll learn from

25:12.629 --> 25:13.662
The lawsuit, huh? what do you

25:13.730 --> 25:15.564
Think about that? hey, doc! what

25:15.632 --> 25:17.166
Are you wearing?

25:20.237 --> 25:21.971
Oh. yeah, i got him right

25:22.038 --> 25:23.839
Here.

25:25.976 --> 25:27.810
Oh, sir. i'm sorry. this is a

25:27.878 --> 25:29.144
Private party. you can't come

25:29.212 --> 25:30.913
In. your name, it's not even on

25:30.981 --> 25:33.482
The list. please step back.

25:40.223 --> 25:41.657
Sean! wait!

25:44.394 --> 25:46.862
Wait! wait!

25:55.338 --> 25:57.907
Such a pretty pig, isn't he?

25:57.974 --> 26:00.276
Very pretty.

26:00.343 --> 26:02.244
But do you think he's done?

26:02.312 --> 26:04.647
Only one way to find out. t.

26:04.714 --> 26:05.481
Ahem.

26:05.548 --> 26:06.982
Ooh.

26:09.619 --> 26:12.988
Eew. a little overdone, i'd say.

26:13.056 --> 26:15.557
Ladies, i am so sorry that

26:15.625 --> 26:17.059
You don't like your meal.

26:17.127 --> 26:18.494
But he just refused to let me

26:18.561 --> 26:19.962
Tenderize him first.

26:20.030 --> 26:20.996
Look-heh heh-we're

26:21.064 --> 26:22.831
Starving. now, there has to be

26:22.899 --> 26:25.668
Something that we can do.

26:25.735 --> 26:26.835
Let's ask the man himself,

26:26.903 --> 26:27.670
Shall we?

26:27.737 --> 26:29.805
Good idea.

26:30.540 --> 26:32.007
tell us what you don't

26:32.075 --> 26:34.476
Like about yourself.

26:34.544 --> 26:35.644
Everything.

26:35.712 --> 26:40.015
How can you say that?

26:40.083 --> 26:41.150
Look at me.

26:41.217 --> 26:44.186
look at me.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.521
i'm on the wrong side of 40.

26:45.588 --> 26:47.523
i got a...

26:47.590 --> 26:49.291
fake tit from a one-in-a-million

26:49.359 --> 26:51.293
cancer.

26:51.361 --> 26:53.128
i can't lose the pounds like i

26:53.196 --> 26:54.630
used to. my hair keeps falling

26:54.698 --> 26:57.266
out. my entire livelihood is

26:57.334 --> 26:58.634
becoming the enron of surgical

26:58.702 --> 27:00.636
procedures. and now my closest

27:00.704 --> 27:02.972
friend, my...

27:03.039 --> 27:05.908
biggest supporter is leaving me.

27:05.976 --> 27:07.643
oh, quit being so negative.

27:07.711 --> 27:10.079
you sound like sean. when you

27:10.146 --> 27:11.580
show no fear, you project

27:11.648 --> 27:13.082
confidence and your life will

27:13.149 --> 27:15.150
always have the appearance of

27:15.218 --> 27:17.486
success.

27:17.554 --> 27:20.556
and image is everything.

27:20.623 --> 27:22.825
is it not?

27:26.730 --> 27:29.498
so... what can you do for me,

27:29.566 --> 27:30.499
then?

27:30.567 --> 27:31.567
have you thought about

27:31.634 --> 27:33.769
injectibles?

27:33.837 --> 27:37.639
they really are the future.

27:37.707 --> 27:40.509
this is bullshit.

27:44.047 --> 27:45.647
i'll get sean to do the

27:45.715 --> 27:47.649
surgery.

27:47.717 --> 27:49.451
thanks so much for doing this.

27:49.519 --> 27:50.886
are you kidding?

27:50.954 --> 27:52.321
i've been waiting 20 years

27:52.389 --> 27:54.790
to highlight all your flaws.

27:54.858 --> 27:56.158
why, do i have a lot?

27:57.827 --> 28:00.262
well, for starters,

28:00.330 --> 28:01.864
you're pompous, self-centered,

28:01.931 --> 28:03.065
almost sociopathic in your

28:03.133 --> 28:04.933
complete disregard for anyone

28:05.001 --> 28:06.502
besides yourself. you have

28:06.569 --> 28:07.770
almost no talent in the

28:07.837 --> 28:08.771
operating room.

28:08.838 --> 28:10.105
but you've managed

28:10.173 --> 28:11.407
to make an entire career

28:11.474 --> 28:12.941
riding on my coattails, all the

28:13.009 --> 28:14.276
while insisting that you're the

28:14.344 --> 28:16.211
one who is the real star.

28:16.279 --> 28:17.413
for the longest time i actually

28:17.480 --> 28:19.448
admired you for how easily life

28:19.516 --> 28:21.283
seemed to bend to your will,

28:21.351 --> 28:23.452
how women fell at your feet.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.953
and then i grew to hate you for

28:25.021 --> 28:26.455
how careless and single-minded

28:26.523 --> 28:27.523
you could be.

28:27.590 --> 28:29.792
now i just think it's sad,

28:29.859 --> 28:31.293
because for someone who's so

28:31.361 --> 28:33.295
desperate to succeed and get

28:33.363 --> 28:35.898
recognition, i see just how

28:35.965 --> 28:37.800
lonely you really are.

28:37.867 --> 28:39.468
when i'm gone, you'll have

28:39.536 --> 28:41.804
no one left in your life

28:41.871 --> 28:46.308
who cares for you. and...

28:46.376 --> 28:48.577
you will die alone.

29:11.301 --> 29:15.404
am i really this ugly?

29:15.472 --> 29:17.239
don't be upset.

29:17.307 --> 29:18.740
let your shortcomings and your

29:18.808 --> 29:20.876
flaws fuel you. let them push

29:20.944 --> 29:21.910
you further than you ever

29:21.978 --> 29:23.245
thought you could go.

29:23.313 --> 29:24.613
when you stop striving for

29:24.681 --> 29:26.582
perfection, you might as well be

29:26.649 --> 29:27.583
dead, buddy boy.

29:55.745 --> 29:57.246
i'm so sorry about what

29:57.313 --> 29:58.280
happened.

29:58.348 --> 30:00.415
don't be. i'm not dead.

30:00.483 --> 30:02.751
i have so much silicone in me,

30:02.819 --> 30:05.754
i stayed afloat for days.

30:05.822 --> 30:08.624
don't worry about it. it's ok.

30:08.691 --> 30:11.093
come on. i've had a really long

30:11.161 --> 30:12.394
day.

30:26.342 --> 30:28.277
i missed you so much.

30:28.344 --> 30:30.312
prove it.

30:40.790 --> 30:41.557
kimber's voice: you couldn't

30:41.624 --> 30:44.193
save me, honey.

30:44.260 --> 30:48.230
nobody could.

30:48.298 --> 30:50.566
good-bye, christian.

31:04.214 --> 31:07.015
don't worry, i'll never leave

31:07.083 --> 31:07.950
you.

31:08.017 --> 31:12.788
who are you?

31:12.855 --> 31:14.256
you don't see the family

31:14.324 --> 31:16.959
resemblance?

31:17.026 --> 31:20.462
come give your dad a hug.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.831
get out of my house.

31:22.899 --> 31:24.299
you're not my father, you're

31:24.367 --> 31:26.468
a monster.

31:31.874 --> 31:33.175
you can try and deny where

31:33.243 --> 31:35.477
you came from as much as you

31:35.545 --> 31:39.615
want, but you'll always be

31:39.682 --> 31:42.384
daddy's little boy.

31:43.686 --> 31:45.654
uhh!

31:51.327 --> 31:53.695
aw, are you trying to rearrange

31:53.763 --> 31:56.131
my face, just like you're doing

31:56.199 --> 31:57.599
to your own on the surgery table

31:57.667 --> 31:58.800
right now?

32:04.741 --> 32:10.545
ahh. stop fighting who you are.

32:10.613 --> 32:13.548
my darkness is a part of you.

32:13.616 --> 32:16.084
you have my dna, christian. you

32:16.152 --> 32:20.289
have my dna.

32:20.356 --> 32:21.790
although i have to admit, you

32:21.858 --> 32:23.325
did a lot of the heavy lifting

32:23.393 --> 32:26.094
on your own.

32:26.162 --> 32:29.531
stop. sean, please,

32:29.599 --> 32:31.366
don't hurt me.

32:31.434 --> 32:33.435
oh, it'll be over before you

32:33.503 --> 32:35.437
know it.

32:42.178 --> 32:44.613
did you know that getting

32:44.681 --> 32:46.315
a facelift is the physiological

32:46.382 --> 32:47.316
equivalent of going through

32:47.383 --> 32:48.550
a windshield at 60 miles

32:48.618 --> 32:49.484
an hour?

32:49.552 --> 32:51.453
please, don't. please.

32:56.559 --> 32:57.759
i can bring him out now.

32:57.827 --> 33:00.128
we're done.

33:00.196 --> 33:02.364
turn that thing off.

33:12.017 --> 33:13.351
never let me give a patient

33:13.419 --> 33:15.386
a hard time about pain again.

33:15.454 --> 33:17.021
ahh! ohh.

33:17.089 --> 33:17.922
you know, under normal

33:17.990 --> 33:20.291
circumstances, i'd rub it in.

33:20.359 --> 33:21.759
but because you did it for

33:21.827 --> 33:24.729
the business, i'm gonna increase

33:24.797 --> 33:26.264
your morphine regime and say

33:26.332 --> 33:28.266
thank you.

33:35.574 --> 33:36.574
what do you think?

33:36.642 --> 33:38.176
oh, i thought you looked good

33:38.243 --> 33:40.178
already.

33:45.451 --> 33:46.484
you didn't do this because of

33:46.552 --> 33:47.852
a lawsuit or because you took

33:47.920 --> 33:49.120
one for the team. you did it

33:49.188 --> 33:52.256
because you wanted a facelift.

33:58.764 --> 33:59.797
i noticed it while i was

33:59.865 --> 34:03.167
shaving a couple of months ago.

34:03.235 --> 34:04.869
nothing anybody else would see,

34:04.937 --> 34:05.937
but i do this for a living.

34:06.004 --> 34:07.105
everyone gets older,

34:07.172 --> 34:09.072
christian. you know, and you're

34:09.141 --> 34:10.708
one of those lucky ones. you're

34:10.775 --> 34:12.543
only gonna get better looking.

34:12.610 --> 34:14.411
hmm.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.646
you know why i have

34:15.714 --> 34:18.116
relationships that never last?

34:18.183 --> 34:19.617
or why i trade in my car every

34:19.685 --> 34:20.551
6 months?

34:20.619 --> 34:22.887
a. d. d.? a complete lack of

34:22.955 --> 34:23.855
a soul?

34:23.922 --> 34:29.127
no. i hate change.

34:29.194 --> 34:32.463
terrified by it. i don't like it

34:32.531 --> 34:36.167
when things end. i like to end

34:36.235 --> 34:39.170
them myself, on my own terms.

34:39.237 --> 34:39.971
it keeps you from getting

34:40.038 --> 34:41.005
hurt, huh?

34:41.072 --> 34:43.775
it also keeps me alone.

34:43.842 --> 34:44.509
i just can't accept it when

34:44.576 --> 34:47.745
things are over.

34:47.813 --> 34:50.815
when things are perfect, you

34:50.882 --> 34:51.649
know.

34:51.717 --> 34:55.152
life is not perfect. life is

34:55.219 --> 34:58.956
messy. sometimes life is very

34:59.024 --> 34:59.857
messy.

34:59.925 --> 35:01.959
we still talking about me?

35:02.027 --> 35:03.428
i'm talking about life.

35:03.495 --> 35:05.263
you know, and wanting things to

35:05.330 --> 35:06.764
be perfect and getting

35:06.832 --> 35:08.766
disappointed over and over and

35:08.834 --> 35:10.835
over because it's never gonna

35:10.903 --> 35:13.404
be. then what happens? you end

35:13.472 --> 35:14.539
up being alone.

35:14.606 --> 35:17.675
hmm. depressing.

35:17.743 --> 35:19.911
i slept with daniella.

35:19.978 --> 35:22.680
she's great, ok. she's

35:22.748 --> 35:24.015
absolutely great. and she's

35:24.082 --> 35:25.450
gorgeous and she's funny

35:25.517 --> 35:27.185
and... gorgeous.

35:27.252 --> 35:28.352
mm-hmm.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.888
you know, i think, ok, i've

35:30.956 --> 35:32.356
waited and this is my reward,

35:32.424 --> 35:36.227
right? we were making love and,

35:36.295 --> 35:39.664
uh, she's having this orgasm

35:39.731 --> 35:42.733
that's just...

35:43.969 --> 35:50.107
i know. and then she, uh...

35:50.175 --> 35:51.142
she what?

35:51.210 --> 35:52.043
i can't even say it. i can't

35:52.110 --> 35:52.810
say it.

35:52.878 --> 35:53.511
ejaculated?

35:53.579 --> 35:55.012
like a fire hose.

35:55.080 --> 35:55.780
are you serious?

35:55.848 --> 35:56.547
i almost drowned.

35:56.615 --> 35:57.448
ha ha.

35:57.516 --> 35:58.249
it's not funny.

35:58.317 --> 35:59.450
it's pretty funny.

35:59.518 --> 36:01.052
i mean, i told her, i said,

36:01.119 --> 36:02.720
"it's ok. i don't mind it, i

36:02.788 --> 36:04.388
think of it as a compliment. "

36:04.456 --> 36:06.190
but the truth is-

36:06.258 --> 36:07.191
the truth is you're just like

36:07.259 --> 36:12.597
me. you want life to be easy

36:12.664 --> 36:16.234
and clean.

36:16.301 --> 36:21.572
that's a damn shame.

36:22.808 --> 36:23.641
who is it?

36:23.709 --> 36:25.843
it's me, liz.

36:31.149 --> 36:32.183
can i come in?

36:32.251 --> 36:34.719
i don't think so.

36:34.786 --> 36:36.721
please?

36:48.333 --> 36:51.969
look, i know i didn't call you,

36:52.037 --> 36:53.571
and it's only because-

36:53.639 --> 36:54.405
you were repulsed and

36:54.473 --> 36:55.206
disgusted.

36:55.274 --> 36:57.675
no.

36:57.743 --> 36:58.910
shocked.

36:58.977 --> 37:01.445
thanks.

37:01.513 --> 37:04.515
only because it was

37:04.583 --> 37:08.319
unexpected.

37:08.387 --> 37:09.954
and it freaked me out, and i got

37:10.022 --> 37:14.992
scared. it's not you.

37:15.060 --> 37:18.062
i thought that women who could,

37:18.130 --> 37:19.664
you know, you know...

37:19.731 --> 37:21.098
squirt.

37:21.166 --> 37:23.401
yeah, squirt. i thought they

37:23.468 --> 37:27.505
only existed in lesbian porn.

37:27.573 --> 37:32.276
but you are so real. and i don't

37:32.344 --> 37:36.180
want to give up on someone

37:36.248 --> 37:39.050
who i feel so connected to

37:39.117 --> 37:41.552
because of my ignorance.

37:41.620 --> 37:45.089
you are wonderful. and i am so

37:45.157 --> 37:47.625
sorry.

37:47.693 --> 37:50.595
hey, hon. who is it?

37:50.662 --> 37:53.664
um, it's dr. elizabeth cruz

37:53.732 --> 37:55.900
from mcnamara/troy. she's

37:55.968 --> 37:57.001
a client of mine, and we

37:57.069 --> 37:58.436
discovered that we're neighbors,

37:58.503 --> 38:00.571
so i told her that if there was

38:00.639 --> 38:02.206
any sample she wanted, she could

38:02.274 --> 38:04.942
just-she could stop by.

38:05.010 --> 38:07.144
this is my husband edward.

38:07.212 --> 38:08.512
hi. nice to meet you,

38:08.580 --> 38:09.213
dr. cruz.

38:09.281 --> 38:10.147
nice to meet you.

38:10.215 --> 38:12.617
whatever she's selling, can't

38:12.684 --> 38:14.151
go wrong.

38:14.219 --> 38:16.220
right.

38:16.288 --> 38:17.688
how about i walk you out?

38:17.756 --> 38:19.857
sure.

38:19.925 --> 38:21.258
i'll be right back, sweetie.

38:21.326 --> 38:23.260
ok, sure.

38:38.076 --> 38:39.176
are you going back to your

38:39.244 --> 38:41.245
husband?

38:41.313 --> 38:43.814
i can't do it, liz. i can't.

38:43.882 --> 38:47.051
i can't be gay.

38:47.119 --> 38:50.187
you are gay.

38:50.255 --> 38:54.325
maybe. but...

38:54.393 --> 38:57.795
at least with him i'm normal.

38:57.863 --> 39:00.731
i don't do that.

39:00.799 --> 39:02.133
you're gonna miss out on

39:02.200 --> 39:04.635
a lot of joy.

39:04.703 --> 39:06.070
being like that doesn't bring

39:06.138 --> 39:08.572
me joy.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.074
it's just not how i see myself.

39:10.142 --> 39:13.411
it's just not...

39:13.478 --> 39:18.849
not how i want to see myself.

39:18.917 --> 39:21.218
i'm-i'm so sorry.

39:21.286 --> 39:23.354
me, too.

39:40.906 --> 39:42.673
ahh, that's the kind of call

39:42.741 --> 39:43.874
you like to get from your

39:43.942 --> 39:44.675
lawyer.

39:44.743 --> 39:45.476
i told you the ayers didn't

39:45.544 --> 39:46.410
have a case. the only thing they

39:46.478 --> 39:47.845
had is balls for trying to sue

39:47.913 --> 39:48.779
us in the first place.

39:48.847 --> 39:49.714
too bad. they could have

39:49.781 --> 39:50.881
gotten a feather lift for half

39:50.949 --> 39:51.782
off instead.

39:51.850 --> 39:52.683
mm-hmm.

39:52.751 --> 39:53.951
you know, i think you getting

39:54.019 --> 39:55.586
that surgery helped our case.

39:55.654 --> 39:56.420
so you're saying that that

39:56.488 --> 39:59.290
inflated ego of mine could have

39:59.357 --> 40:01.659
helped us for a change?

40:01.727 --> 40:03.461
i'm just saying you really

40:03.528 --> 40:04.361
puyour money where your mouth

40:04.429 --> 40:06.664
was. i admire that.

40:06.732 --> 40:07.798
good.

40:07.866 --> 40:09.633
to our continued success.

40:09.701 --> 40:11.035
cheers.

40:11.103 --> 40:13.904
yes, cheers.

40:13.972 --> 40:15.706
you're not drinking? it's bad

40:15.774 --> 40:16.373
luck.

40:16.441 --> 40:17.241
no, no, no. i'm still

40:17.309 --> 40:18.542
recovering. you know, i don't

40:18.610 --> 40:20.411
want to get all swelled up, look

40:20.479 --> 40:21.712
like i came from jill jacobson's

40:21.780 --> 40:22.546
office.

40:22.614 --> 40:24.348
oh, yeah. that wouldn't be

40:24.416 --> 40:25.282
good.

40:25.350 --> 40:26.617
hey, fellas, have you seen

40:26.685 --> 40:29.019
this? your surgery is one of
