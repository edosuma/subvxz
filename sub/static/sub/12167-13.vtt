00:01.964 --> 00:04.134
<i>(Zelenka) 7,549.</i>

00:04.300 --> 00:08.179
<i>(McKay) Oh, please. Prime. 4,021.</i>

00:08.346 --> 00:10.473
<i>(Zelenka) Nice try. Not prime.</i>

00:10.640 --> 00:13.268
Lieutenant Ford, 599.

00:13.435 --> 00:16.646
- I don't care if it's a prime number or not.
- Yes or no?

00:16.813 --> 00:19.566
- No.
- It's incredible. 10 for 10.

00:19.733 --> 00:22.235
- He is terrible.
- I suck at Prime, Not Prime.

00:22.402 --> 00:26.531
- Somehow I'm gonna sleep tonight.
- It's gone way beyond prime numbers.

00:26.698 --> 00:31.077
<i>It's a true/false game. Just by guessing,
you should get at least half right.</i>

00:31.244 --> 00:33.121
993.

00:33.288 --> 00:35.165
- Prime.
- That's an easy one.

00:35.331 --> 00:38.752
- You hearing this, Hays?
- Not really. Too busy doing my job.

00:38.918 --> 00:43.340
We've been through this section of
Atlantis, Dr Killjoy. It's structurally sound.

00:43.506 --> 00:46.092
Lieutenant Ford,
would you mind being a subject

00:46.259 --> 00:49.054
of research paper
on statistical improbabilities?

00:49.220 --> 00:54.059
This is payback for guys like me beating
up guys like you in high school, right?

01:04.277 --> 01:06.988
<i>(Weir on radio) What's it like
out in the suburbs?</i>

01:07.155 --> 01:09.282
With the exception
of the storage room,

01:09.449 --> 01:12.952
which the lovely Dumais informs me
is in no immediate danger,

01:13.119 --> 01:15.205
it appears in relatively good shape.

01:15.372 --> 01:19.292
- Even after all the flooding?
- It's dark, damp and smells terrible.

01:19.459 --> 01:21.961
But from an engineering standpoint,
we're good.

01:22.128 --> 01:24.631
- Head back.
- Heading back.

01:24.798 --> 01:29.135
All right, you clowns. I don't often get
a chance to say this, so savour it.

01:29.302 --> 01:32.347
Good work, boys and girls. Let's go home.

01:32.514 --> 01:36.184
Wait, wait, wait.
We're missing Johnson and Wagner.

01:37.727 --> 01:40.105
Wagner, Johnson, what's your position?

01:43.233 --> 01:45.694
<i>We need backup! They're coming at us!</i>

01:45.860 --> 01:47.904
- What?
- Where are they?

01:48.071 --> 01:50.240
- Down this corridor.
- We're on our way!

01:59.499 --> 02:02.085
Johnson. Johnson, you OK?

02:04.212 --> 02:07.090
McKay. He's dead.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.758
- Johnson, what happened here?
- They got him.

02:09.925 --> 02:12.345
Who got him?

02:15.098 --> 02:18.268
Calm down. There's nothing here.

02:18.435 --> 02:22.605
- Can't you see them? They're everywhere!
- I need a medical team here stat!

02:24.733 --> 02:27.277
Ah! Aagh!

02:41.583 --> 02:44.294
It's no use. She's gone.

04:03.206 --> 04:06.459
This is Dr Beckett.
What is the nature of the emergency?

04:08.169 --> 04:10.588
It's too late. They're gone.

04:10.755 --> 04:13.883
- Who's gone? How?
- Wagner and Johnson.

04:14.050 --> 04:16.511
<i>- I need a containment team.
- I'm sorry?</i>

04:16.678 --> 04:20.432
- A containment team? Why?
- People don't see things and drop dead.

04:20.598 --> 04:25.186
We've been surveying unexplored areas.
I think they were exposed to something.

04:25.353 --> 04:29.774
If they were infected, there's
a very good chance that we were too.

04:29.941 --> 04:34.029
- I recommend level-four quarantine.
- Agreed. Carson, you hear all that?

04:34.195 --> 04:37.240
We'll get into our hazmat gear
and head down. Sit tight.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.993
<i>- I'll make sure Dr Weir's briefed.
- Thank you.</i>

04:40.160 --> 04:42.912
You heard the man. Follow me.

04:43.079 --> 04:45.206
We're just gonna stay here?

04:45.999 --> 04:48.793
- That's the plan.
- May I say it's a terrible one?

04:48.960 --> 04:52.047
- No, you may not.
- We should get the hell outta here.

04:52.213 --> 04:54.382
If it is airborne, we may be infected.

04:54.549 --> 04:57.844
Heading back would only endanger
the rest of the population.

04:58.011 --> 05:00.472
- What if we're not?
- There's no way to know.

05:00.638 --> 05:04.059
- But I feel perfectly fine!
- End of discussion.

05:04.225 --> 05:06.728
Peterson, we're staying here.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.148
Actually, wait a second.

05:10.315 --> 05:12.901
Everyone follow me.

05:24.704 --> 05:27.499
They've begun to institute
a level-four quarantine.

05:27.666 --> 05:30.543
It can't really be
a biological infection, can it?

05:30.710 --> 05:33.129
I have no idea what it is.

05:33.296 --> 05:38.218
But we should play it safe and initiate
self-regulated quarantine in the city.

05:38.385 --> 05:42.055
- That's pretty severe.
- The Ancients suffered from a plague.

05:42.222 --> 05:45.392
If McKay's team have stumbled upon it
and become infected,

05:45.558 --> 05:48.728
we need to take every precaution
to prevent an outbreak.

05:48.895 --> 05:53.566
We will suspend any and all gate activity
and keep everyone where they are,

05:53.733 --> 05:59.239
just until we have a clearer picture of
exactly what killed Wagner and Johnson.

06:34.858 --> 06:36.484
Agh!

06:39.029 --> 06:42.699
- You have not been practising.
- Yes, I have.

06:42.866 --> 06:47.454
- If this was really a fight...
- I would have shot you by now.

06:52.667 --> 06:57.005
No matter how many hours I put into this,
you're still gonna kick my ass.

06:57.839 --> 07:00.216
It is not for the winning that we practise.

07:00.383 --> 07:02.677
What's the point?

07:03.636 --> 07:06.598
<i>(Weir over intercom)
May I have everyone's attention?</i>

07:06.765 --> 07:09.434
<i>We have run into
a questionable medical situation.</i>

07:09.601 --> 07:11.311
<i>At Dr Beckett's suggestion,</i>

07:11.478 --> 07:15.523
<i>we have decided to put the city
into a self-regulated quarantine.</i>

07:16.775 --> 07:20.945
For at least the next couple of hours,
I need everyone to stay where they are

07:21.112 --> 07:24.991
<i>and report anyone
moving freely through the halls.</i>

07:25.158 --> 07:27.660
I hope you'll understand. Thank you.

07:30.747 --> 07:33.416
What the hell is this?

07:34.292 --> 07:36.378
Did you bring your radio?

07:37.504 --> 07:40.090
This is the section
Wagner and Johnson explored?

07:40.256 --> 07:42.509
- Yes.
- So we're retracing their steps?

07:42.676 --> 07:45.720
My motivations are based
on self-preservation.

07:45.887 --> 07:50.684
Wait, wait. Ford's right. Doesn't this
increase our chances of getting infected?

07:50.850 --> 07:53.436
Let me spell this out for you, OK?

07:53.603 --> 07:56.898
If there is a bacterial agent
and it is not airborne,

07:57.065 --> 08:01.027
it should be safe for us to look around
as long as we take precautions.

08:01.194 --> 08:04.447
However, if it is an airborne agent,

08:04.614 --> 08:07.283
there's a good chance
we've already been infected.

08:07.450 --> 08:09.536
Shouldn't we wait for Dr Beckett?

08:09.703 --> 08:11.913
Those men were only there
for 12 hours.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.333
That's an alarmingly short
incubation period.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.336
If anyone else is infected, as in maybe us,

08:18.503 --> 08:21.715
seconds are gonna count, Lieutenant.

08:21.881 --> 08:24.884
All right, light. Let's go.

08:38.940 --> 08:41.609
Everybody stay here. Ford.

08:42.736 --> 08:45.280
- You just told...
- Everybody except Ford.

08:45.447 --> 08:48.616
You think I'm going in there by myself?
Uh-uh.

09:04.758 --> 09:06.843
<i>(McKay) Don't touch anything.</i>

09:19.564 --> 09:21.441
This is not good.

09:26.571 --> 09:30.241
<i>- I'm ranking military officer here.
- (Weir) I'm aware of that.</i>

09:30.408 --> 09:33.036
You were off radio
and we had to act quickly.

09:33.203 --> 09:37.582
This is all protocol put into place
long before this expedition even began.

09:37.749 --> 09:40.752
Bates and I agreed
this was the best plan of action.

09:40.919 --> 09:44.005
All right. Teyla and I
are coming up to join you.

09:44.172 --> 09:47.467
We are in quarantine.
Everyone stays where they are.

09:47.634 --> 09:50.011
We're nearly a mile away on the east pier.

09:50.178 --> 09:53.765
Do you really think I'm in any danger
walking to the control room?

09:53.932 --> 09:56.643
<i>We don't know
where they contracted the virus.</i>

09:56.810 --> 09:58.687
<i>This is a medical situation.</i>

09:58.853 --> 10:01.815
Only authorised personnel
in hazmat suits roam freely.

10:01.981 --> 10:04.609
Those rules apply to everyone,
including you.

10:04.776 --> 10:09.197
Well, then, get someone
to bring me a hazmat suit.

10:09.364 --> 10:13.493
Everyone in hazmat is configuring
the lab to deal with a possible outbreak.

10:13.660 --> 10:17.038
If an opportunity arises,
I will send someone to come get you.

10:17.205 --> 10:20.625
In the meantime,
radio contact will have to do.

10:20.792 --> 10:25.588
All right. Just... keep us in the loop.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.841
<i>Will do.</i>

10:29.843 --> 10:34.347
Any of these open containers could have
released the virus that killed them.

10:34.514 --> 10:36.808
How would it survive for all these years?

10:36.975 --> 10:39.394
Viruses can remain dormant
for long periods.

10:39.561 --> 10:42.522
I'm hoping the answer
will be found in the database.

10:42.689 --> 10:44.774
- OK, I think that...
- Yes, yes, yes.

10:44.941 --> 10:48.361
It's not networked in
with the rest of the Ancient systems.

10:48.528 --> 10:53.783
It only contains information about the
experiments that took place in this room.

10:53.950 --> 10:56.286
- Weir, it's McKay.
- Go ahead, Rodney.

10:56.453 --> 11:00.540
- Where's Beckett?
- It takes time to load a team into suits.

11:00.707 --> 11:03.960
We've stumbled across
something... a little troubling.

11:04.127 --> 11:06.212
That's not what I wanted to hear.

11:06.379 --> 11:08.548
We may have found an Ancient viral lab

11:08.715 --> 11:10.800
where Wagner and Johnson
were exposed.

11:10.967 --> 11:15.138
There's no way of knowing whether the
Ancients were just studying the viruses

11:15.305 --> 11:17.474
or actively creating them.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.977
The storm's done quite a number
on this place and I've got...

11:21.853 --> 11:24.731
Dumais. Dumais?

11:26.566 --> 11:28.651
- Dumais!
- What the hell are you?

11:28.818 --> 11:30.570
Dumais! Dumais!

11:30.737 --> 11:33.156
<i>(she yells)</i>

11:41.915 --> 11:43.458
<i>(Dumais screams)</i>

11:53.968 --> 11:58.098
Tell Beckett to pick up the pace!
I've just lost another member of my team.

11:58.264 --> 12:00.433
- Where's Peterson?
- What?

12:00.600 --> 12:01.976
Peterson!

12:11.403 --> 12:14.489
I think we have him.
He's trying to make his way back.

12:14.656 --> 12:19.244
Grodin is locking all the doors in the
hallway and killing power to the section.

12:19.411 --> 12:21.871
You need to send someone to stop him.

12:22.038 --> 12:25.250
<i>- It's under control.
- No, it's not under control.</i>

12:25.417 --> 12:28.378
<i>He knows as much
about Ancient technology as I do.</i>

12:28.545 --> 12:32.090
At the very most, what you're doing
will just slow him down.

12:48.982 --> 12:52.652
- Where does that hallway lead?
- Straight here.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.620
<i>Peterson, this is Elizabeth Weir.
Can you hear me?</i>

13:03.496 --> 13:07.000
I can't imagine how frightening
this whole ordeal must be,

13:07.167 --> 13:12.380
but Dr Beckett has reached the rest
of your team and begun to treat them.

13:12.547 --> 13:15.467
<i>I think the best thing for you to do
is to head back.</i>

13:15.633 --> 13:19.637
<i>If Beckett gives you a clean bill of health,
you can get back to the city.</i>

13:25.852 --> 13:28.563
- Are you sure he can hear me?
- Positive.

13:28.730 --> 13:32.567
Can you do anything to make it harder
to get through those doors?

13:32.734 --> 13:34.819
I can try.

13:49.668 --> 13:53.254
- You seem perfectly fine.
- Dumais seemed fine, until she wasn't.

13:53.421 --> 13:56.007
I've had them set up a small field station.

13:56.174 --> 13:58.551
- We've started the autopsies.
- Any ideas?

13:58.718 --> 14:02.597
- You're all in good shape.
- Stop trying to convince me I'm fine.

14:02.764 --> 14:05.684
I think we all know better.
Are we done here?

14:06.434 --> 14:09.396
- Yes.
- I'll see what I can get from the database.

14:09.562 --> 14:11.981
Let me know what the autopsy shows up.

14:12.148 --> 14:16.027
Oh, and tell your pathologist
to start with their heads.

14:46.683 --> 14:50.270
<i>- Someone has to do something.
- (Weir) We are doing something.</i>

14:50.437 --> 14:52.772
<i>- Grodin's working...
- Not good enough.</i>

14:52.939 --> 14:56.526
Someone has to go out there
and stop him. Teyla and I are ready.

14:56.693 --> 15:00.989
Peterson isn't thinking straight and
he's endangering the entire population.

15:01.156 --> 15:05.660
We don't yet know the nature of the virus.
This is still a medical situation.

15:05.827 --> 15:08.788
- We don't have time. I'm heading out.
- Seal the gym.

15:14.711 --> 15:18.506
- What the hell is this?
- You are the ranking military officer.

15:18.673 --> 15:23.136
- I can't chance you getting infected.
- I can't chance you getting infected. Bates.

15:23.303 --> 15:25.638
- Yes, sir?
- Unlock the gym.

15:26.765 --> 15:28.683
- Yes, sir.
- Stand down, Bates.

15:28.850 --> 15:33.063
<i>- You are not in command here, Major.
- We'll agree to disagree.</i>

15:33.229 --> 15:35.023
Bates, open the door.

15:36.816 --> 15:39.235
<i>- Don't.
- He's heading right for you.</i>

15:39.402 --> 15:42.822
So we'll stop him.
We'll talk him down, block his way.

15:42.989 --> 15:47.911
Bates, I am ordering you to open the doors
between the gym and the med lab now.

15:56.044 --> 15:58.129
We're heading out.

16:08.473 --> 16:10.975
I'm sorry, ma'am.

16:12.227 --> 16:14.437
It doesn't really matter now, does it?

16:24.948 --> 16:29.452
Dr Beckett, I have the preliminary
autopsy results on the first two victims, sir.

16:29.619 --> 16:33.748
<i>- Anything of interest?
- They both died of a brain aneurysm.</i>

16:33.915 --> 16:36.376
In itself, it isn't all that remarkable.

16:36.543 --> 16:41.631
<i>The chances of two people next to each
other dying of it is statistically improbable,</i>

16:41.798 --> 16:44.843
but it's not the smoking gun
we were hoping for.

16:45.010 --> 16:48.179
<i>- You said...
- Get to the good part, Dr Biro.</i>

16:48.346 --> 16:52.851
What is truly interesting is both ruptures
happened in exactly the same place,

16:53.018 --> 16:55.228
right above the visual cortex.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.480
<i>And the third one - Dumais?</i>

16:57.647 --> 17:00.567
Just getting to her now, sir.
I'll let you know.

17:00.734 --> 17:03.278
- She did say brain aneurysm?
- That's right.

17:03.445 --> 17:06.531
Best news I've heard all day.
Let me show you something.

17:12.037 --> 17:15.999
You should not have undermined
Dr Weir's authority in front of Bates.

17:16.165 --> 17:21.046
Sometimes Elizabeth makes a decision
and gets locked into it. That's a problem.

17:21.963 --> 17:26.134
She is not the only one
who suffers from that affliction.

17:28.595 --> 17:32.849
Dr Weir, this is Sheppard.
Teyla and I are ready to head out.

17:33.016 --> 17:35.101
<i>What's Peterson's location?</i>

17:41.733 --> 17:43.109
Elizabeth.

17:44.986 --> 17:47.697
He's in section E19, level three.

17:55.872 --> 17:57.957
Let's go.

18:36.788 --> 18:39.958
I haven't read the entire entry,
but it looks like our guy.

18:40.125 --> 18:44.754
Six-hour hibernation, reoccurring visions,
and best of all, so I left it till last,

18:44.921 --> 18:46.798
brain haemorrhage or aneurysm.

18:46.965 --> 18:48.883
That definitely sounds familiar.

18:49.050 --> 18:51.428
Maybe there's something here
about how to...

18:54.931 --> 18:57.225
No!

19:04.190 --> 19:05.817
Sorry.

19:06.985 --> 19:08.361
Rodney?

19:14.826 --> 19:17.537
I've been seeing things.

19:17.704 --> 19:19.789
Since when?

19:20.623 --> 19:24.586
About an hour. First, you think
it's just your eyes playing tricks...

19:24.753 --> 19:27.088
They get worse.

19:27.881 --> 19:30.300
You too?

19:30.467 --> 19:32.344
They come right at you.

19:35.180 --> 19:38.600
- It's like a ghost.
- I've been over the survey schedule.

19:38.767 --> 19:41.519
Johnson and Wagner
started off on their own

19:41.686 --> 19:44.105
but crossed paths with Dumais
an hour later.

19:45.815 --> 19:49.778
Dumais died almost exactly
an hour after Johnson and Wagner.

19:49.944 --> 19:54.115
- Who did they meet up with next?
- My greater concern is who Dumais met.

19:54.282 --> 19:56.576
Dumais? Who'd she run into?

20:06.461 --> 20:08.213
Me.

20:08.380 --> 20:11.549
She ran into Hays and me.

20:14.177 --> 20:16.262
We're next.

20:27.107 --> 20:31.486
- Dr Peterson, I presume.
- I'm not going back there.

20:31.653 --> 20:34.364
You don't have much of a choice.

20:35.990 --> 20:38.076
Easy.

20:38.994 --> 20:41.579
I go back there,
I get infected, that's murder.

20:41.746 --> 20:45.417
Once we ensure you are not infected,
you can go back into the city.

20:45.583 --> 20:49.629
Until then, you are a threat
to the rest of the population.

20:50.463 --> 20:55.593
- You won't shoot one of your own team.
- You will not be allowed back to the city.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.430
Just wait a second!
Take me back to the med lab.

20:58.596 --> 21:01.266
Quarantine me there. I'll go voluntarily.

21:01.433 --> 21:03.893
Just please don't make me go back there.

21:08.314 --> 21:11.317
Really, I'm fine. I feel perfectly fine.

21:13.236 --> 21:17.157
Dr Weir, this is Sheppard. Peterson
has agreed to go back to the med lab

21:17.323 --> 21:20.035
until we can get this situation resolved.

21:20.201 --> 21:22.495
Stop!

21:34.382 --> 21:36.259
Oh, my God. Is he all right?

21:36.426 --> 21:38.511
He's been shot.

22:01.701 --> 22:04.996
- What's going on?
- Ancient controls are unresponsive.

22:05.163 --> 22:07.957
Peterson transported into the mess hall.

22:08.124 --> 22:12.879
- For some reason we can't follow him.
- The city has put us into a lockdown.

22:13.046 --> 22:15.256
- Override it.
- I can't.

22:15.423 --> 22:18.426
Atlantis must be designed
to respond to outbreaks.

22:18.593 --> 22:21.930
It locked down when Peterson
transported out of the east side.

22:22.097 --> 22:24.641
Why not when Johnson and Wagner
were infected?

22:24.808 --> 22:29.062
The detection systems might have been
affected by the flooding in those areas.

22:29.229 --> 22:33.608
Once Peterson entered the mess hall,
the pathogen was instantly detected

22:33.775 --> 22:36.277
and the city protected itself.

22:38.113 --> 22:41.074
- What are my options?
- Limited.

22:41.241 --> 22:45.328
As of now, we're completely
locked out of the mainframe.

22:53.545 --> 22:58.008
I am about to die of a brain aneurysm.
How does a heart monitor help?

22:58.174 --> 23:00.593
If you die, we'll have a better idea of how.

23:00.760 --> 23:05.140
- At that point, I will cease to care.
- A lot of other people live in the city.

23:05.306 --> 23:07.434
Yes, the living.

23:14.065 --> 23:18.069
I thought we were in a lockdown.
Why did that open up for us?

23:20.405 --> 23:25.201
Weir, this is Sheppard. Are you able
to get the transporters online?

23:25.368 --> 23:29.539
Doesn't look promising. Atlantis itself
seems to have sensed a threat

23:29.706 --> 23:31.833
and taken over most of the controls.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.919
<i>- So it's shut down the transporters?
- That's right.</i>

23:35.086 --> 23:39.549
- I wish we would have thought of that.
- We did think of that, Major!

23:39.716 --> 23:43.595
That entire section had to be powered up
to open the door to Peterson.

23:43.762 --> 23:48.266
If you hadn't gone after him, he wouldn't
have been able to use the transporters.

23:50.185 --> 23:52.604
Do you still feel it was a good idea?

23:52.771 --> 23:55.732
- Where'd he transport to?
- The mess hall.

23:55.899 --> 23:59.652
Everyone else respected the quarantine.
There were only a few people.

23:59.819 --> 24:03.323
- You made your point.
- Make your way back to the city.

24:03.490 --> 24:06.534
Wait in Beckett's lab
for further instructions.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.334
<i>- Dr Beckett.
- Any progress, Dr Biro?</i>

24:14.501 --> 24:20.840
Just finished Dumais' autopsy. Would it
surprise you to learn it was an aneurysm?

24:21.007 --> 24:24.052
<i>- No, it wouldn't. Thank you.
- Didn't think so.</i>

24:24.219 --> 24:27.305
The position of the rupture
could explain the visions.

24:27.472 --> 24:31.309
Swelling in that area
could account for the hallucinations.

24:31.476 --> 24:33.687
I'm no MD, but wouldn't brain swelling

24:33.853 --> 24:37.148
just mean that we experience
weird visual anomalies?

24:37.315 --> 24:40.819
- It would depend on the person.
- Our visions are so similar.

24:40.985 --> 24:44.614
Wouldn't the visions we experience
be more random?

24:44.781 --> 24:49.494
- Most likely.
- The things we're seeing are identical.

24:49.661 --> 24:51.746
You think it might have something...

24:51.913 --> 24:53.873
No! No!

24:55.417 --> 24:57.669
Hays, remember, it's not real!

24:57.836 --> 24:59.379
No! No!

25:00.296 --> 25:03.633
They're coming right at us!
Can't you see them?

25:03.800 --> 25:06.428
<i>(Beckett) His heart might resynchronise.</i>

25:06.594 --> 25:10.432
- He's not fine! Do something!
- There's nothing to do.

25:16.146 --> 25:19.899
One, two, three, four, five.

25:21.359 --> 25:24.863
- One, two, three, four, five.
- Stop.

25:26.990 --> 25:30.618
It's not his heart. Just... stop.

25:50.889 --> 25:53.391
How are you feeling?

25:55.268 --> 25:56.936
I'm...

25:58.021 --> 25:59.689
I'm...

26:01.399 --> 26:05.695
I have a sister. We're not close.
I don't even know how you'd find her...

26:05.862 --> 26:08.907
- Don't talk like that.
- She's the only family I have.

26:09.074 --> 26:12.118
Someone should tell her what happened.

26:12.285 --> 26:15.205
And make it sound good, OK?

26:15.372 --> 26:18.917
Tell her I... I died saving someone.

26:19.084 --> 26:22.045
Kids. I died saving kids, a bunch of them.

26:22.212 --> 26:26.800
I've got some theories on looping the
power in the gate to charge a dummy ZPM.

26:26.966 --> 26:30.428
It probably won't work,
but you should have someone look at it.

26:30.595 --> 26:34.474
- We'll look at it together.
- Stop interrupting my last thoughts.

26:34.641 --> 26:38.311
This is important stuff you need to hear.

26:42.399 --> 26:45.026
Now, if you're here for more than a year,

26:45.193 --> 26:49.656
I've left some notes on how to roll
blackouts to maintain your power.

26:49.823 --> 26:54.035
And, oh, tell everyone that I was inches
away from a theory of unification,

26:54.202 --> 26:58.790
but the notes, they were lost
when I died saving the...

26:58.957 --> 27:01.042
- Kids.
- Yeah.

27:17.726 --> 27:19.811
OK.

27:21.354 --> 27:23.523
I should be dead now.

27:29.279 --> 27:32.073
- You ran into Dumais at the same time?
- Exactly.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.784
Then, yes, you should be dead.

27:37.078 --> 27:38.747
Oh, God.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.920
<i>- I'm still here.
- (Ford) Yes, you are.</i>

27:49.132 --> 27:51.718
- Interesting.
- Interesting?

27:51.885 --> 27:54.387
- Don't take this the wrong way, but...
- Why?

27:54.554 --> 27:56.806
Exactly.

27:56.973 --> 27:59.267
I don't care.

27:59.434 --> 28:01.936
I mean, I really don't care.

28:10.987 --> 28:13.281
<i>- (Sheppard) Dr Weir.
- Yes, Major?</i>

28:18.620 --> 28:21.790
We've reached the city,
but we haven't hit the quarantine.

28:21.956 --> 28:25.502
- You sure it's locked you out?
- I can't get into my office.

28:25.669 --> 28:27.629
It hasn't given us any trouble yet.

28:30.507 --> 28:33.718
- Hazmat suits. They're protected.
- What?

28:33.885 --> 28:37.305
The city must sense
they're in no danger of infection.

28:37.472 --> 28:41.893
It makes sense. Atlantis allows protected
personnel to assist the infected.

28:42.060 --> 28:46.523
We should make our way to the mess hall.
Everyone will be scared and confused.

28:46.690 --> 28:50.485
<i>(Weir) I agree. Get to the mess hall
and report back.</i>

28:54.698 --> 28:56.783
Are you certain you wanna see this?

28:56.950 --> 29:00.036
How could something organic
be that efficient?

29:00.203 --> 29:05.041
Just because it's out of the ordinary for us
doesn't mean it's not commonplace here.

29:05.208 --> 29:08.378
I don't buy that.
Most habitable planets we've encountered

29:08.545 --> 29:12.966
are carbon copies of Earth
in terms of environmental conditions.

29:13.133 --> 29:16.845
- Unless...
- I'll be back. What's up, Rodney?

29:17.012 --> 29:19.848
Incubation to completion
is exactly six hours,

29:20.015 --> 29:21.891
the visions are identical,

29:22.058 --> 29:26.229
and the location of the aneurysm
is the same for every single deceased.

29:32.444 --> 29:35.739
- Is that what I think it is?
- It's a nanovirus.

29:35.905 --> 29:38.616
One manufactured to kill humans.

29:46.041 --> 29:48.251
<i>- A nanovirus?
- (McKay) That's right.</i>

29:48.418 --> 29:51.004
Let's pretend I don't know
exactly what that is.

29:51.171 --> 29:55.091
Nanotechnology, it's technology
that operates on a nanite scale.

29:55.258 --> 29:59.012
- Around a billionth of a millimetre.
- They're microscopic machines.

29:59.179 --> 30:02.057
They carry out very specific tasks.

30:02.223 --> 30:06.811
The idea of swallowing a pill and having
a million robots cure whatever ails you.

30:08.396 --> 30:10.899
You're all infected
with microscopic machines?

30:11.066 --> 30:13.485
No bigger than a single-cell organism,

30:13.651 --> 30:16.821
although instead of having
a purpose of curing a disease...

30:16.988 --> 30:19.157
The virus terrorises its victims

30:19.324 --> 30:23.411
by tapping into their visual cortex
and rupturing an artery in their brain.

30:23.578 --> 30:27.248
- Infecting others along the way.
- But I doubt they can multiply.

30:27.415 --> 30:30.251
I don't know how many
it takes to kill a human,

30:30.418 --> 30:34.047
but eventually I imagine
they'll spread themselves too thin.

30:34.214 --> 30:37.717
- Could it be Wraith?
- That would definitely be my first guess.

30:37.884 --> 30:41.721
- I'm not so sure about that.
- But the visions, the shrill sound...

30:41.888 --> 30:46.309
They're terrifying, but why would the
Wraith create the equivalent of a WMD?

30:46.476 --> 30:49.104
They're killing us
not because they want us dead

30:49.270 --> 30:51.398
but because they need us for food.

30:51.564 --> 30:55.694
It would be like cattle farmers
creating mad cow disease.

30:55.860 --> 30:58.613
You did come across it in an Ancient lab.

30:58.780 --> 31:02.367
Wiping out the Wraith's food supply
is a last-ditch consideration?

31:02.534 --> 31:05.453
The Ancients would never create
something like this.

31:05.620 --> 31:11.251
- It doesn't explain the visions, either.
- Who built it is the least of our concerns.

31:11.418 --> 31:13.420
Good point.

31:13.586 --> 31:16.214
We have yet to determine
how one contracts it.

31:16.381 --> 31:20.135
It is very possible
that none of you have been infected.

31:20.301 --> 31:24.347
- Then why are you in hazmat suits?
- Just as a precaution.

31:24.514 --> 31:27.809
<i>- Major Sheppard. This is McKay.
- What is it?</i>

31:27.976 --> 31:30.478
<i>I could use your help at my lab.</i>

31:31.730 --> 31:33.606
Go. I will be fine.

31:38.987 --> 31:42.324
There's only one thing
that explains why I survived.

31:42.490 --> 31:44.743
Rodney has the Ancient gene.
Hays did not.

31:44.909 --> 31:49.122
- But Rodney's not an Ancient.
- But he's been inoculated with the gene.

31:49.289 --> 31:52.459
You're saying the virus
is designed to only kill humans?

31:52.625 --> 31:56.004
- Well, I'm human.
- Yes, we're making a point, Rodney.

31:56.171 --> 31:59.341
<i>- Give everyone the gene therapy.
- It's not gonna do it.</i>

31:59.507 --> 32:03.303
- I've been given the gene. It didn't take.
- I'm already on it.

32:03.470 --> 32:06.556
The gene therapy is only effective
in 48% of recipients.

32:06.723 --> 32:10.226
If I was given the gene shot,
how long would it take to kick in?

32:10.393 --> 32:14.022
- A minimum of four hours.
- I don't have four hours.

32:14.189 --> 32:17.442
I met McKay and Hays 90 minutes
after they met Dumais.

32:17.609 --> 32:20.737
I have a little under an hour
before my brain explodes.

32:20.904 --> 32:24.449
Aiden, listen to me.
You've been up for almost 20 hours now.

32:24.616 --> 32:27.744
- You're not thinking straight. Stay calm.
- Calm?

32:27.911 --> 32:32.332
I have a million tiny robots in my veins
whose only purpose is to kill me!

32:32.499 --> 32:35.543
- You stay calm.
- We are about to have hallucinations.

32:35.710 --> 32:39.089
We are infected, Carson.
How do you expect us to act?

32:39.255 --> 32:42.509
<i>- (Ford) There's gotta be another way.
- I am working on it.</i>

32:46.471 --> 32:48.807
<i>- (Sheppard) McKay, I'm here.
- You see it?</i>

32:48.973 --> 32:52.435
<i>- The big thing in the middle of the room?
- That's the one.</i>

32:52.602 --> 32:55.230
Should I pay attention
to all these warnings?

32:55.397 --> 32:57.482
<i>(McKay) Not today, no.</i>

32:58.775 --> 33:00.860
What are you gonna do?

33:01.027 --> 33:04.155
The virus is effectively a machine
run by a computer.

33:04.322 --> 33:08.159
The best way to knock out a computer
is with an electromagnetic pulse.

33:13.039 --> 33:16.209
We're through shutting down
the electronic gear from Earth.

33:16.376 --> 33:19.921
We're still locked out
of the Ancient controls, though.

33:20.088 --> 33:22.924
The Ancient technology
works differently than ours.

33:23.091 --> 33:25.844
An EM pulse shouldn't have
any long-lasting effect.

33:26.011 --> 33:28.680
We're ready.

33:28.847 --> 33:30.932
We're all set, Rodney.

33:31.099 --> 33:34.436
OK. Here we go.

33:34.602 --> 33:37.605
Wait! How are we gonna know if it works?

33:37.772 --> 33:41.776
Sheppard's dialling up the most powerful
pulse the generator can manage.

33:41.943 --> 33:44.821
It should affect most of the central tower.

33:44.988 --> 33:49.117
Once it wipes out the virus,
the city should end the lockdown.

33:49.284 --> 33:51.786
- It won't make it here?
- If the pulse works,

33:51.953 --> 33:56.166
we'll walk you to my lab, sit you in front
of the EMP and repeat the process.

33:56.333 --> 33:58.585
<i>- Major.
- It's working.</i>

33:58.752 --> 34:03.423
<i>- When should I hit the discharge button?
- There should be a red overload light.</i>

34:07.427 --> 34:09.471
- I see it.
- Wait till it comes on,

34:09.637 --> 34:11.806
give it a ten count and then discharge.

34:13.058 --> 34:14.809
<i>- Ten count?
- Don't worry.</i>

34:14.976 --> 34:17.145
I've been around more EMPs than anyone.

34:17.312 --> 34:20.106
This is gonna be...
I'm gonna be fine, right?

34:20.273 --> 34:23.693
Yes. That's a yes. You'll be fine.

35:00.939 --> 35:03.942
<i>- (McKay) Anything?
- Is it possible it might take time?</i>

35:04.818 --> 35:06.194
Doubtful.

35:10.573 --> 35:13.243
<i>Are you still locked out
of the Ancient mainframe?</i>

35:19.457 --> 35:21.334
Got any other ideas?

35:28.883 --> 35:31.761
29 minutes.

35:45.108 --> 35:47.277
It didn't work! It didn't work!

35:47.444 --> 35:51.114
- It's still unclear.
- What? Either it worked or it didn't!

35:51.281 --> 35:55.952
- They're trying to determine...
- They're... They're everywhere.

35:56.119 --> 35:58.538
You are experiencing a hallucination.

36:14.054 --> 36:16.181
Oh, my God.

36:20.935 --> 36:25.357
- I've already tried that. It's blown.
- Before we reset the sub-switch.

36:25.523 --> 36:27.817
Maybe we shouldn't have overloaded it.

36:27.984 --> 36:30.820
It's fixable. We just need
to use trial and error.

36:30.987 --> 36:34.824
Even if we get it working, who's to say
the pulse is gonna get bigger?

36:34.991 --> 36:38.370
Ford and Zelenka have 20 minutes
before their arteries rupture.

36:44.209 --> 36:46.878
Are you sure an EMP will kill this thing?

36:48.213 --> 36:51.257
- Yes.
- All right. I have an idea.

36:58.640 --> 37:02.018
<i>- What do you mean, no?
- (Weir) It's too dangerous.</i>

37:02.185 --> 37:04.729
You'd rather lose a third of our population?

37:04.896 --> 37:07.357
<i>- We're not there yet, Major.
- We are there!</i>

37:07.524 --> 37:12.904
Ford and Zelenka are next. The people in
the mess hall have a little over three hours.

37:13.071 --> 37:15.657
People are gonna keep dying
unless we do this.

37:15.824 --> 37:17.993
Even if we get the EMP generator online,

37:18.159 --> 37:21.454
the chances are slim
we would ever get it powerful enough.

37:21.621 --> 37:24.332
Can we bring the infected
to the generator?

37:24.499 --> 37:27.252
The city won't let
infected personnel through.

37:27.419 --> 37:31.798
The major is right. The only way to create
an EMP strong enough is to...

37:31.965 --> 37:35.135
To detonate a nuclear explosion
in the atmosphere. I heard.

37:35.301 --> 37:37.053
<i>It sounds severe,</i>

37:37.220 --> 37:41.349
but if the major was able to overload
a generator 20 miles above the city,

37:41.516 --> 37:43.935
we'd be safe
from a radiological standpoint,

37:44.102 --> 37:47.814
and the blast would create a devastating
electromagnetic shock wave,

37:47.981 --> 37:49.899
<i>enough to knock this virus out.</i>

37:50.066 --> 37:52.944
Hopefully without destroying
our computer equipment.

37:53.111 --> 37:56.156
It's worth the risk.

37:59.075 --> 38:02.078
OK. You have a go.

38:36.196 --> 38:38.698
<i>- I'm almost in position.
- (Weir) Understood.</i>

38:38.865 --> 38:41.826
Will the EM pulse have any effect
on the puddle jumper?

38:41.993 --> 38:45.538
I'm hoping not.
I'm more worried about the shock wave.

38:45.705 --> 38:48.375
- Good luck.
- You too.

38:48.541 --> 38:53.213
You'll only have 30 seconds once
you release it. Get as far away as you can.

38:54.339 --> 38:57.967
Get as far away from
the nuclear explosion as possible.

38:58.134 --> 39:01.012
- That's good advice. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

39:01.179 --> 39:03.056
<i>I'm releasing the generator...</i>

39:04.391 --> 39:06.476
...now!

39:14.442 --> 39:16.528
Detonation in 25 seconds.

39:20.323 --> 39:22.492
<i>20 seconds.</i>

39:25.412 --> 39:27.497
<i>15 seconds.</i>

39:29.916 --> 39:32.711
<i>Detonation in ten, nine,</i>

39:32.877 --> 39:36.798
<i>eight, seven, six,</i>

39:36.965 --> 39:40.677
<i>five, four, three, two,</i>

39:40.844 --> 39:42.929
<i>one.</i>

40:01.531 --> 40:06.536
Major Sheppard, come in.
This is Weir. Please respond.

40:06.703 --> 40:09.831
Communications may have been
disrupted by the blast.

40:11.708 --> 40:13.793
Major, do you read me?

40:26.514 --> 40:31.061
This is Sheppard.
I've cleared the blast. I'm returning home.

40:33.813 --> 40:36.024
- Glad to hear it, Major.
- Did it work?

40:36.191 --> 40:38.276
We're about to find out.

40:43.490 --> 40:47.827
We should know almost right away. The
pulse only lasts a couple of microseconds.

40:47.994 --> 40:52.457
The city's already ahead of us, Rodney.
You have a green light to return.

41:12.477 --> 41:14.354
Are you OK?

41:14.521 --> 41:17.023
Yeah, just a little nuke. Nothing, really.

41:17.190 --> 41:20.360
The naqahdah generator plan
was very clever. Good work.

41:20.527 --> 41:24.614
Thank you. Now I'm going to bed.

41:25.323 --> 41:28.159
We need to discuss what happened earlier.

41:28.326 --> 41:30.245
Now?

41:33.415 --> 41:35.667
That can never happen again.

41:37.210 --> 41:39.087
Look, I'm sorry about...

41:39.254 --> 41:41.840
You're expertised in military matters,

41:42.007 --> 41:45.885
and I should defer to those expertised
in such situations.

41:46.052 --> 41:47.679
Thank you.

41:47.846 --> 41:52.267
But you are not the one who decides
what is and what is not a military situation.

41:52.434 --> 41:54.811
General O'Neill and Colonel Sumner
warned me

41:54.978 --> 41:58.064
that you don't respect
the proper chain of command.

41:58.231 --> 42:01.609
- Sometimes I see a situation different...
- No, listen to me.

42:01.776 --> 42:04.946
You endangered yourself
and the lives of many others.

42:05.113 --> 42:08.283
Because I thought it was
the best course of action to take.

42:08.450 --> 42:11.578
- And, by the way, I saved your ass.
- I know you did.

42:12.704 --> 42:15.206
But you have to trust me.

42:16.916 --> 42:19.127
- I do.
- Do you?

42:19.294 --> 42:24.632
You have a minute? We've spent some
quality time with the nanovirus samples.

42:24.799 --> 42:29.137
- They've all been incapacitated.
- Well, that's good news.

42:29.304 --> 42:33.224
Yes. Also I think we can rule out
that they were created by the Wraith.

42:33.391 --> 42:36.353
They're different than
any Wraith technology.

42:36.519 --> 42:40.607
If not the Wraith... then who made 'em?

42:40.774 --> 42:43.276
I honestly don't know,

42:43.443 --> 42:46.821
but whoever they were,
let's hope they're not still around.

42:50.575 --> 42:53.078
Let's hope.
