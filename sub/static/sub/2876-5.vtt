WEBVTT

00:02.877 --> 00:04.086
Oh, hey, you guys?

00:04.254 --> 00:07.047
I couldn't get a reservation
for the night of my birthday...

00:07.257 --> 00:09.383
...so we'll have to do dinner
Thursday night instead.

00:09.592 --> 00:14.513
- Thursday? But that's Halloween.
- So?

00:14.889 --> 00:17.016
It's just spooky, that's all.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.768
Uh, so is Mike coming to dinner?

00:19.978 --> 00:23.731
No. It's my first birthday
with a boyfriend, and he has to work.

00:23.898 --> 00:27.943
I'd get mad at him, but I think
it's too soon to show my true colors.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.405
Well, I would make the reservation
for five.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.198
One of us has to stay home
and watch Emma.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.451
- Which one of us should go to dinner?
- Oh, Rachel.

00:37.829 --> 00:41.874
Uh, actually, I was thinking
maybe both of us could go.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.500
Oh, yay.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.713
Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thought
into your gift.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.300
All right, so great, we can all go now.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.178
That is fun. Hey. You know what?

00:54.345 --> 00:57.806
We all haven't been together,
the six of us, in such a long time.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.225
What are you talking about?
We're all together now.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.020
Uh, Mon? Chandler's not here.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.150
Oh, dear God.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.860
Hello, everyone. It's nice to see
our team together for the first time.

01:52.028 --> 01:55.447
Now, before we get started,
are there any questions?

01:55.657 --> 01:57.366
- Yes. Ken, is it?
- That's right.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.744
Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa
is that you fell asleep in a meeting...

02:00.912 --> 02:03.914
...and took the job without realizing
what you were saying yes to?

02:06.376 --> 02:09.169
Well, don't believe
everything you hear, Ken.

02:09.336 --> 02:10.878
But yeah, that's true.

02:12.257 --> 02:17.594
All right, let's get started by, uh,
taking a look at last quarter's figures.

02:18.763 --> 02:23.100
Uh, Claudia, aren't you supposed
to blow smoke up the boss's ass?

02:23.810 --> 02:29.648
- I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
- No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.234
Right now, I can't remember why.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.237
You're not allowed to smoke
in this office though, right?

02:35.446 --> 02:39.032
Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke
in offices with 15 people or less.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.870
- Would you like one?
- All right, look. I don't smoke anymore.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.331
But if the rest of you want to light up,
go ahead, it's fine.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.129
So you all smoke, then? Heh.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.382
You know, it's almost rude
that I'm not smoking.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.968
- That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke...
- Ken, please!

03:01.264 --> 03:04.349
No, I can't. I can't smoke.
If I smoke, my wife would kill me.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.810
I'm sorry, but isn't your wife
back in New York?

03:08.897 --> 03:11.815
I've always liked you, Ken.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.656
Trick or treat.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.368
- Hey.
- Ooh, and "treat" it is.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.373
Wow. So glad I changed.

03:28.958 --> 03:32.753
I almost wore my threadbare robe
that can't contain my breasts.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.090
This is not what I'm wearing.
I'm ovulating...

03:37.258 --> 03:40.677
...and Chandler's gonna be home.
So I thought we would try before dinner.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.598
Oh. Wait, does that...? You guys won't
be late for my dinner, will you?

03:44.807 --> 03:46.975
Chandler and I have not seen each other
in over a week.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.727
We'll probably be the first ones there.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.688
Okay. See you there. Happy humping.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.567
Hey. Well, hey.

03:55.985 --> 03:59.112
Oh. Wow, somebody smoked out here?

04:01.282 --> 04:04.785
My God, don't people know you're
not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

04:04.994 --> 04:10.666
Actually, in Oklahoma, smoking is legal
in offices with fewer than 15 people.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.126
Oh, you smoked.

04:13.336 --> 04:18.089
No. I just happen to know a lot of trivia
about smoking in different states.

04:18.257 --> 04:22.844
For example, in Hawaii,
cigarettes are called lei-lana-lukus.

04:24.222 --> 04:28.767
- Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
- Do you think Monica is gonna smell it?

04:28.977 --> 04:32.479
Are you kidding? That woman
has the nose of a bloodhound.

04:32.647 --> 04:36.066
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.613
Pheebs?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.408
I'm gonna go.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.581
Okay. Something to cover the smell.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.129
Oven cleaner.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.177
Unscented.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.347
Welcome home.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.351
I've missed you.

05:11.519 --> 05:16.064
- You wanna join me in the bedroom?
- No, thanks, I'm good.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.944
Oh, okay. So you want to play it
that way, do you?

05:21.362 --> 05:23.864
Well, uh, you know what?
Actually, I just got off a plane...

05:24.073 --> 05:26.366
...so I'm feeling gross.
Maybe I should take a shower.

05:26.576 --> 05:30.329
- Come here, you don't need a shower.
- All right, the truth is...

05:30.496 --> 05:33.373
...I soiled myself
during some turbulence.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.422
What do I smell? I smell smoke.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.757
Did you smoke?

05:42.967 --> 05:45.802
Yes. But I just had one.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.429
Two.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.349
Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.937
A pack. Two pack... A carton.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.607
Three big fat cartons in two days.

06:00.401 --> 06:03.403
But it's over. I've made a decision,
I'm not gonna smoke anymore.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.201
Well, those are for you.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.956
All right. Well, we'll just, uh,
see you when you get here. Bye.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.752
Oh, that was my mom.
She's stuck in terrible traffic.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.713
Okay, well, that is now the third sign
that I should not leave Emma.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.925
- What are the other two?
- Well, the first one is, I don't want to.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.595
And second one, I'm not going.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.931
I know this is the first time
we're leaving the baby.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.558
Hey, I know how hard it is for you. But...

06:33.726 --> 06:36.853
But everything's gonna be fine.
I mean, my mom is gonna be with her.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.189
- She's great with kids.
- She is?

06:39.357 --> 06:41.191
Yeah.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.235
What about Monica?

06:43.444 --> 06:47.531
Hey, you only hear Monica's side of that.
Okay, that little fatso was a terror.

06:50.326 --> 06:54.913
- I just don't think I can do it.
- You know what? You can and you should.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.082
Really, it'll be good for you.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.291
In fact, you know what?

06:58.459 --> 07:01.545
Why don't you go ahead to the restaurant,
and I will wait for my mom...

07:01.712 --> 07:05.424
...and then I'll meet you there?
No, no, really, you should go. Go out.

07:05.591 --> 07:12.139
Really, the world is your oyster.
Kick up your heels. Paint the town red.

07:12.974 --> 07:17.352
- You need to learn some new slang.
- I'm serious. Come on, you should go.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.397
Here. No, just go.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.524
- Well... Oh!
- No, no. You know what?

07:22.692 --> 07:26.695
You're not getting back in there.
The baby's fine. Now, scram.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.740
Yeah, tell your story walking.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.953
I was just going to say
that I left my keys.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.788
Oh.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.751
Holy moley, are we in a pickle now.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.633
Where is everyone?
They're 40 minutes late.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.802
- I know.
- I'm starving.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.680
I knew we were coming here tonight.
I ate nothing all day.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.016
What about me?
I only had one lunch today.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.687
So are we expecting
the rest of our party shortly?

08:00.897 --> 08:03.231
Yes, they are expected presently.
Yeah.

08:03.399 --> 08:07.027
Their, um... Their arrival is in the offing.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.488
Right. We do have
a table for two available.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.323
- Perhaps you'd be...
- No, they're coming.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.991
We're waiting right here.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.911
Joseph.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.624
One needn't worry. They shan't be long.

08:20.958 --> 08:24.377
It's just that we do have
some large parties waiting.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.506
Oh, one really does have a stick
up one's ass, doesn't one?

08:30.384 --> 08:33.553
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad? Huh?

08:33.763 --> 08:37.557
Where the little kid walks
through Grandpa? It's chilling.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.602
I messed up. It was a meeting.
Everybody was smoking.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.938
So what? Don't you have any willpower?

08:43.147 --> 08:46.066
Willpower? I've watched home movies
of you eating Ding Dongs...

08:46.234 --> 08:48.068
...without taking the tinfoil off.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.739
You said that was sexy.

08:54.575 --> 08:58.161
Okay, look, can we just drop this?
I'm not gonna smoke again.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.872
That's right, because I forbid you
to smoke again.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.499
- You forbid me?
- Mm-hm.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.544
You know, I've flown a long way
to see my loving wife.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.629
Is she here, by the way?

09:07.838 --> 09:13.218
Chandler, don't joke with me. Okay?
I'm very, very upset right now.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.804
Oh. Would you say this is the most upset
you could be?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.013
I think so.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.307
Well, then I might as well...

09:19.517 --> 09:21.601
...do this.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.406
Not really sure what to do now.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.201
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.954
We're already late
for Phoebe's birthday dinner.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.039
So you're going to put out
that cigarette...

09:43.207 --> 09:46.042
...we're gonna put this fight on hold,
and go have sex.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.296
Fine. What?

09:49.505 --> 09:52.340
Sex. This is the last day I'm ovulating.
If we don't do it...

09:52.508 --> 09:54.676
...we're gonna have to wait
until next month.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.845
You're serious?

09:57.013 --> 10:00.515
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.685
- And no cuddling.
- And no kissing your neck.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.812
Oh, good. I hate it when you do that.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.319
And lots of kissing your neck.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.946
Okay, well, the super's not home.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.699
But my mother's gonna be here,
and she has the key.

10:17.908 --> 10:21.119
I can't wait that long. You have to do
something. Knock that door down.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.496
I would, but I bruise like a peach.

10:25.916 --> 10:29.836
Besides, you know, everything's
gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.881
- What if she jumps out of the bassinet?
- Can't hold her own head up.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.257
But, yeah, jumped.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.260
Oh, my God.
I left the water running.

10:37.428 --> 10:41.306
You did not leave the water running.
Please, pull yourself together, okay?

10:41.515 --> 10:45.810
- Well, did I leave the stove on?
- You haven't cooked since 1996.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.773
Is the window open? If the window's
open a bird could fly in and...

10:49.982 --> 10:51.858
Oh, my God, you know what?
I think you're right.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.443
- Listen.
- What? What?

10:53.611 --> 10:58.031
A pigeon. No. No, wait, no.
An eagle flew in.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.118
Landed on the stove and caught fire.

11:04.330 --> 11:10.377
The baby, seeing this, jumps across
the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.

11:10.544 --> 11:13.380
The eagle, however, misconstrues this
as an act of aggression...

11:13.547 --> 11:15.256
...and grabs the baby in its talon.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.677
Meanwhile, the faucet
fills the apartment with water.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.347
Baby and bird, still ablaze,
are locked in a death grip...

11:22.515 --> 11:27.352
...swirling around the whirlpool
that fills the apartment.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.231
Boy, are you gonna be sorry
if that's true.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.570
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.698
It's been an hour.

11:39.865 --> 11:43.868
The maitre d' asked if you'd reconsider
switching to a smaller table.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.662
Maybe we should just eat now.

11:45.830 --> 11:49.457
You can't order until the entire
party's arrived. Restaurant policy.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.585
Well, how about this?
Another table leaves, right...

11:52.753 --> 11:55.797
...but there's still some food left
on their plates.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.426
Okay, what's the restaurant's policy
about people eating that?

11:59.635 --> 12:02.554
- It's frowned upon.
- But it happens.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.560
- All right, I gotta go to the bathroom.
- No, you can't go.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.979
No, no, no.
I can't hold this table on my own.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.189
If they ask me to move, I'll cave.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.358
Well, if you ask me to stay, I'll pee.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.992
Good evening, miss.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.911
Miss?

12:28.914 --> 12:31.291
Miss? Miss?

12:31.459 --> 12:36.045
Okay, fine, I'll move. All right.
You don't have to manhandle me.

12:37.047 --> 12:40.550
Where? Okay.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.719
Thank you.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.846
Wow.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.937
Finally, you guys made it.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.279
Pheebs, who the hell...? Ah!

13:09.121 --> 13:12.540
Spend more time with the tie.
That'll make a baby.

13:13.375 --> 13:17.670
Look, I can't do this. I can't make love
to you while we're fighting this way.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.173
Oh, sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.009
But when you wanted to have sex
right after my uncle's funeral...

13:23.219 --> 13:25.303
That was a celebration of life.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.598
All right, look, I'm not gonna do this.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.309
Is this the way you want our baby
to be conceived?

13:32.728 --> 13:34.771
No, you're right.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.649
Yeah, we shouldn't do it like this.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.530
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.991
I shouldn't have come down on you
so hard about the smoking.

13:47.284 --> 13:51.162
So you had a few cigarettes.
It's not the end of the world.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.957
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.459
You are incredible.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.170
And listen,
I'm not gonna smoke again.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.423
And if I do, I promise
I will hide it so much better from you.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.058
- Do you want to?
- Yeah, let's celebrate life.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.810
Okay.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.772
Oh, God.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.816
Oh, thank God you're okay.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.485
I'm sorry we left you.
Mommy will never leave you again.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.697
Never, ever, ever again.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.740
Great. So let's get going.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.579
Oh, no. I mean it. After what just happened,
I'm never leaving her again.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.540
I understand. Separation is hard.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.711
One time I was about to leave Ross
to go to the beauty parlor.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.630
And he got so upset
he took off all his clothes...

14:42.798 --> 14:46.050
...tucked his willy between his legs...

14:46.218 --> 14:51.055
...and cried out,
"Mommy, I'm a girl. Take me with you."

14:58.689 --> 15:02.984
Somehow, over time,
it got easier to be apart from you.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.280
Ah.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.075
You are welcome.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.496
- You know what? Let's not talk.
- What?

15:15.706 --> 15:19.167
- I am still so mad at you for smoking.
- But you said you forgave me.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.169
It was just a couple of cigarettes,
no big deal.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.212
Oh, blah-blah-blah-blah.

15:24.256 --> 15:28.801
I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't
have sex with me if we were fighting.

15:29.678 --> 15:35.391
- You tricked me to get me into bed?
- That's right. I got mine.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.730
I feel so used.

15:42.066 --> 15:45.485
Well, I guess they're not coming.
You want to just order?

15:46.195 --> 15:48.196
Thank you.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.953
Waiter? All right, this is gonna
go fast, so try to keep up.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.246
Risotto with shaved truffles
and the rib steak...

15:57.414 --> 15:59.958
...with the golden chanterelles
and the Bordelaise sauce...

16:00.125 --> 16:03.628
...unless any of that stuff I just said
means "snails."

16:03.963 --> 16:07.298
- It does not.
- Tomato tart...

16:07.466 --> 16:09.467
...and, um, which of the pastas
would you recommend?

16:09.677 --> 16:12.470
- Oh, well, they're both exquis...
- Both it is. Thank you.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.847
Oh, uh, can I make a special request?

16:15.015 --> 16:16.891
Can you bring everything
as soon as it's ready?

16:17.059 --> 16:18.601
Appetizers, entrées, we don't care.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.019
- Hey.
- Hi. Hi.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.400
- I'll just wait to put your order in.
- You guys are over an hour late.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.735
- What happened to you two?
- So sorry.

16:27.903 --> 16:31.280
- We got locked out of the apartment.
- That's a great story. Can I eat it?

16:32.324 --> 16:35.243
And then Rachel wasn't sure
she could leave the baby.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.871
It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday
and I did what I had to do.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.541
And that's Judy over there at the bar
with Emma?

16:45.379 --> 16:48.423
This is for the best. I'm not distracted,
worrying about Emma...

16:48.590 --> 16:52.218
...how she's doing at home, and I'm
gonna be completely here with you.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.720
- Oh, she spit up.
- What?

16:53.887 --> 16:57.098
She spit up. Judy? She spit...
Judy, look alive, Judy.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.937
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:03.689 --> 17:07.775
- Ooh.
- Whew, everything looks delicious.

17:07.943 --> 17:11.738
What should I have?
What should I have?

17:11.905 --> 17:15.782
Never hit a woman.
Never hit a woman.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.703
I know what you mean,
this looks incredible.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.789
Ross bruises like a peach.
He bruises like a peach.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.209
Okay, I'll have the fig salad
and the duck.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.211
I'll have the, uh, soup and the salmon.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.380
Remember, whatever comes up first,
okay?

17:29.548 --> 17:30.923
- And hurry...
- Happy birthday.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.258
Son of a bitch.

17:33.427 --> 17:36.512
- Where have you been?
- Well, we had a little fight.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.681
I would never lie
to get someone into bed.

17:38.849 --> 17:42.477
You used to tell girls
you were a Kennedy.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.481
Thanks.

17:47.983 --> 17:50.735
Thanks. Wow.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.780
A little tight, isn't it?
Why didn't you get a bigger table?

17:56.200 --> 17:59.285
You had a big table
but they made you move.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.912
Ha, ha. Shut up, Monica.

18:02.498 --> 18:07.085
Oh, well, I suppose that Chandler
will have the smoked duck.

18:08.420 --> 18:13.591
And I suppose that Monica
will have the manipulative shrew.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.302
- I'll give you another minute.
- What, where you going?

18:16.512 --> 18:19.138
He said she wanted the shrew.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.100
Rach, come on, Emma's fine.

18:22.309 --> 18:26.479
You're turning into an obsessive mother,
okay? You need to stop.

18:27.064 --> 18:31.859
You guys ever hear the story about
when Ross' mom went to the beauty salon?

18:33.153 --> 18:38.074
- You mean the willy story?
- Ha, ha. They already know it.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.955
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.623
- Maybe you should order.
- That's okay.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.668
- I told the waiter what they want.
- Why would you do that?

18:48.877 --> 18:51.212
Chandler, control your woman.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.590
Okay, well...
Everybody has ordered.

18:54.758 --> 19:01.430
I would like to start the celebration
and make a toast to Phoebe.

19:01.598 --> 19:04.976
- She dropped her sock.
- Aw. What?

19:05.602 --> 19:08.688
- No. No, Emma dropped her sock.
- Mom's here?

19:08.897 --> 19:12.900
I wanted to have lunch with her today.
She told me she was out of town.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.154
Ross, she still has not noticed
that the baby's sock is on the ground.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.656
It's a good toast.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.492
Look, will you please get her attention?

19:22.327 --> 19:24.620
Mommy?

19:33.672 --> 19:35.756
Oh, for God's sake, Judy,
pick up the sock.

19:35.924 --> 19:39.010
Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!

19:43.265 --> 19:45.266
I'm sorry, was that rude?

19:46.560 --> 19:49.353
Did my little outburst...

19:49.563 --> 19:53.733
...blunt the hideousness
that is this evening?

19:53.942 --> 19:55.818
Look, I know you all
have a lot going on...

19:55.986 --> 20:01.908
...but all I wanted to do was have dinner
with my friends on my birthday.

20:02.075 --> 20:05.745
And you are all so late, and you
didn't even have the courtesy to call.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.959
Well, it's too late now.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.878
Yeah, Pheebs, I don't think that's us.

20:14.171 --> 20:19.550
Oh, well, this is... This is not over.
Hello?

20:21.637 --> 20:25.431
- What is going on with you two?
- Well, you see, I'm ovulating.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.226
Oh, yeah, that's what she says.

20:29.102 --> 20:34.023
But maybe you're not ovulating at all.
Maybe it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.

20:34.691 --> 20:38.861
Yeah, Smokey, that's what it was.
I just can't get enough.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.322
You're not gonna believe this. She lied.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.741
She tricked me into having sex with her.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.453
So? You got to have sex, right?

20:47.913 --> 20:49.956
What's the matter with me?
Why am I such a girl?

20:52.709 --> 20:56.045
- Okay. That was Mike.
- Oh, Phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.423
You are totally right.
We are here 100 percent...

20:59.591 --> 21:02.969
...and we love you, and we are ready
to start your birthday celebration.

21:03.178 --> 21:06.347
Oh. You guys,
that means the world to me.

21:09.476 --> 21:10.935
Okay, I'm gonna take off.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.188
What?

21:14.356 --> 21:16.774
Oh, I love you guys too,
but Mike got off work early.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.776
Wait.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.489
Wait. I'm not the... I'm not the kind of girl
that just ditches her friends...

21:23.657 --> 21:25.908
...to be with her boyfriend.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.410
You know what? I am.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.830
Bye, guys. Judy. Bye.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.001
Oh, thank God. If Phoebe's gone,
can we take Emma home?

21:35.168 --> 21:39.255
That's a good idea. Our babysitter
just pounded another chardonnay.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.673
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

21:40.841 --> 21:44.510
See you. Well, I guess it's just us.

21:48.265 --> 21:52.685
So I'm probably still ovulating.
Do you wanna give it another try?

21:52.936 --> 21:56.147
So you've never had sex
with a Kennedy, have you?

21:57.399 --> 21:59.567
- You're gonna go do it?
- We don't have much time.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.902
Once the egg descends into the
fallopian tube...

22:02.112 --> 22:03.946
Whoa, whoa, get out of here.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.662
I sincerely hope the rest of your party
is returning.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.206
No, just me. All alone.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.672
Dinner for six for one.

22:22.215 --> 22:25.676
Well, you boys are about
to see something really special.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.025
- How was everything, sir?
- Excellent.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.445
The shrew, in particular, was exquisite.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.198
Well, I hope you've got some room left.

22:47.407 --> 22:50.659
Happy birthday to you

22:50.827 --> 22:53.496
Happy birthday to you

22:53.663 --> 22:55.664
Happy birthday, dear

22:55.832 --> 22:56.999
Joey. Joey.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.793
Joey

22:59.044 --> 23:02.171
Happy birthday to you

23:02.339 --> 23:04.965
This is the best birthday ever.
