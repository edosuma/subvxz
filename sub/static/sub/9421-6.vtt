WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:03.968
My father worked as a lawyer
for the richest family in New York,

00:04.037 --> 00:06.471
until his plane went down
in long island sound.

00:06.539 --> 00:08.769
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.173
Tripp, the empire builder.

00:10.243 --> 00:12.404
You're gonna have
to start trusting me sometime.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.447
Letitia,
the sophisticated socialite.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.412
Your father was my great love.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.541
Brian, the man of God.

00:17.617 --> 00:19.380
I lied to my wife
and daughters last night.

00:19.486 --> 00:20.817
I told them that you were an orphan.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.218
I want you and that boy
out of this house

00:22.288 --> 00:23.448
until I figure out what to do.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.252
Patrick, the principled politician.

00:25.325 --> 00:26.758
You have to get your house in order.

00:26.826 --> 00:28.521
Karen,
the professional divorcee.

00:28.595 --> 00:30.688
Using the chapel
for your fourth marriage

00:30.763 --> 00:33.391
would just be insulting
to the rest of the marrying public.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.297
Karen, do not call me
on the home phone number.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.460
I'll always love you, too.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.560
And Jeremy and Juliet...

00:37.637 --> 00:39.400
- Oh, my God!
... the well-behaved twins.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.838
I've been thinking lately,
and I should get a job, right?

00:41.941 --> 00:43.499
My father was working
for someone else.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.044
You should come work for me,
finish what your father started.

00:48.414 --> 00:49.676
You getting anything out of that

00:49.749 --> 00:52.217
better Manhattan conference
so far, Nick?

00:52.285 --> 00:54.116
It's interesting.
A bunch of billionaires talk about

00:54.187 --> 00:56.951
how much real estate
they own in the city.

00:57.757 --> 01:00.055
Well, it's pretty small potatoes, really.

01:00.126 --> 01:01.855
Reason people come here is
for the game.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.227
The game?

01:05.298 --> 01:07.926
The game.
A high-stakes poker game.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.764
Call.
- It's been going on for about 40 years,

01:09.869 --> 01:11.996
20 million just to get in.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.904
Simon elder is gonna be there
this year.

01:14.974 --> 01:16.339
First time.

01:18.311 --> 01:19.744
Well, I guess now's the time

01:19.812 --> 01:21.507
to take this baby to the next level.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.014
- Really?
Yeah.

01:24.117 --> 01:28.486
And from what I heard, it was Dutch
got him invited into the game.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.918
Would've been one of the last things
your dad did.

01:31.991 --> 01:36.155
I guess Mr. elder didn't bring that up
when he had dinner with you, did he?

01:36.229 --> 01:38.322
No, he never mentioned it.

01:38.398 --> 01:42.562
He had time to accuse me
of murdering my best friend,

01:42.669 --> 01:44.796
but he didn't get around to telling you

01:44.871 --> 01:48.534
what he and my best friend
were actually up to.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.543
- I think it was more than poker.
- I do, too.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.648
Well, the game is not
for another two days,

01:55.715 --> 01:58.377
so let us get back to the party.

01:59.252 --> 02:00.276
Hi, Nick.

02:00.353 --> 02:01.718
- Hey, Karen.
- Hello.

02:01.821 --> 02:04.984
- Well, thank you for not avoiding me.
- I haven't been avoiding you.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.116
Oh, don't fib.
You've been a little distant since Italy.

02:07.193 --> 02:09.161
Well, it hasn't been intentional.

02:09.461 --> 02:10.588
Okay.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.153
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.166
Freddy.

02:14.234 --> 02:17.397
- Did you ask about the thing?
- Oh, right. Yes. We need a favor.

02:17.503 --> 02:20.063
Freddy and I have been
so overwhelmed with wedding planning

02:20.173 --> 02:21.936
that we need you to go down to city hall

02:22.008 --> 02:23.032
and get our marriage license.

02:23.109 --> 02:25.236
You know,
do some of that lawyer magic.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.336
You have to sign the license
in person, Karen.

02:27.413 --> 02:29.847
- They haven't changed that law yet?
- No, not yet.

02:29.916 --> 02:31.645
Not even for regular customers?

02:31.718 --> 02:35.154
Seems like there ought to be
some sort of reward, or fringe benefit,

02:35.221 --> 02:37.348
- or something, right?
- Sorry.

02:38.024 --> 02:39.958
You want a cupcake?

02:40.026 --> 02:44.258
I already had three at magnolia
with Juliet, but okay.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.888
- That where you two were?
- Yeah.

02:45.965 --> 02:48.729
She talked about Natalie Kimpton
for hours.

02:48.801 --> 02:51.702
- What a slut.
- Hey. Don't use that word.

02:53.973 --> 02:56.703
What time you want me
at your office tomorrow? 6:00? 5:00?

02:56.776 --> 02:59.301
- 9:00's fine.
- Banker's hours. Okay.

02:59.379 --> 03:02.644
- Are you ready for this?
- Ready? I am drooling.

03:02.715 --> 03:04.148
I'm gonna be a member
of the working class.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.651
- I'm gonna make dad proud.
- See you then.

03:06.719 --> 03:09.552
When Patrick was introduced
to Gerald Ford...

03:09.622 --> 03:11.385
Just before he took over
the presidency.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.959
... he had some words of advice
for the man.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.188
I love this story. Patrick!

03:16.262 --> 03:18.992
Tell Larry what you said to Gerry Ford.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.195
You tell him, dad.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.828
That was your proud moment,
not mine.

03:26.973 --> 03:31.740
He said, "restore dignity
to the white house, sir. "

03:31.844 --> 03:33.778
He was eight years old.

03:35.214 --> 03:36.238
Dignity.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.648
Yowza!

03:42.822 --> 03:46.258
That was a gold-medal performance.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.088
Thanks.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.198
What's the matter, baby?

03:54.100 --> 03:58.628
Sometimes it...
Sometimes it's just kind of depressing.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.606
The only thing intimate
that ever takes place between us

04:01.674 --> 04:05.735
happens in hotel rooms
and limousines, never in public.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.943
Doing what we just did in public
is illegal in most states.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.251
I hate being a secret.

04:15.321 --> 04:17.016
I know.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.024
Hey, you want to go back to Vermont?
We can, you know, take a weekend.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.755
Going to Vermont
is just another giant secret.

04:22.829 --> 04:26.959
- I'm married and running for senate.
- I can't help how I feel, pat.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.800
We've never even stood in the street
and kissed.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.539
Just kissed.

04:50.423 --> 04:53.187
- See?
- See? This isn't so bad.

04:55.528 --> 04:59.259
Did you ever think maybe this
is why I don't want to do it? Hmm?

04:59.766 --> 05:01.199
Because it's hard to feel free with you,

05:01.267 --> 05:04.202
and then not want to feel that way
all the time.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.967
God! You are gonna be
president someday.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.941
- Oh, yeah.
- You always know just what to say.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.171
Hey, Patrick!

05:15.248 --> 05:17.910
- Take a look over here, sweetie! Yeah!
Get down!

05:17.984 --> 05:20.544
Oh, yeah! Thanks a lot, sucker!

05:20.620 --> 05:22.884
Son of a bitch! Get over here!

05:23.122 --> 05:24.350
What are you gonna do, Nick?

05:24.424 --> 05:26.654
That photo gets out,
dad's gonna crucify me.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.023
Well, with all due respect, pat,

05:28.094 --> 05:30.119
you should have thought about that
before making a spectacle.

05:30.196 --> 05:32.096
She's tired of being a secret, okay?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.928
Then she should go out with somebody
who isn't married,

05:34.033 --> 05:36.058
and who isn't running for the senate,
and who isn't a Darling.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.136
That doesn't make it right for people

05:37.236 --> 05:39.397
to stalk their fellow human beings
with cameras.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.666
I mean, if everything everybody did
was captured on film,

05:41.774 --> 05:43.605
none of us would look
like very good people, right?

05:43.676 --> 05:46.167
Look, pat, I'm sure some creep
is gonna try and sell us the negatives

05:46.245 --> 05:48.145
or the memory card
for a million dollars any day now.

05:48.214 --> 05:49.579
Any day is too late.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.082
Detective larrabee on two.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.243
Okay. Look, we're just gonna have
to sit back and wait.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.753
Hang on a second. Hello?

05:56.155 --> 05:58.453
I'm just calling to let you know
that the ntsb report

05:58.524 --> 06:00.890
on your dad's plane crash
came in today.

06:00.993 --> 06:02.756
- What did it say?
- That the police?

06:02.829 --> 06:06.925
It's clean. No evidence of foul play.
No tampering whatsoever.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.160
Run of the mill engine failure.

06:09.235 --> 06:10.463
- Okay.
- Is it about the photos?

06:10.536 --> 06:11.662
No!

06:12.338 --> 06:16.240
I don't know what to say, Mr. George.
I'm sorry your father's gone.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.210
I know how badly you wanted
to hold someone responsible

06:19.278 --> 06:23.840
for this horrible accident,
but that's just what it was, an accident.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.316
And accidents happen.

06:28.421 --> 06:32.187
Yeah. Yeah, they do. Thank you.

06:58.246 --> 07:00.009
You want some coffee?

07:01.516 --> 07:02.983
No.

07:03.050 --> 07:05.348
A bagel? A bear claw?

07:05.420 --> 07:07.183
I'm okay, thank you.

07:08.956 --> 07:11.117
- Anything?
- No. I just...

07:12.894 --> 07:16.352
I guess I'm trying to figure out
what I'm supposed to do,

07:16.431 --> 07:19.764
now that I don't have to find out
who killed my dad.

07:20.902 --> 07:24.030
Maybe you should
just start missing him?

07:26.641 --> 07:29.735
Sorry I'm late.
It's 9:00 somewhere, dude.

07:29.811 --> 07:31.335
Time for work.

07:32.780 --> 07:34.611
Okay, Darling luxury hotels.

07:34.682 --> 07:36.707
Your family owns 23 properties
in the u. S.

07:36.784 --> 07:38.547
And 32 throughout Europe and Asia.

07:38.619 --> 07:40.780
Hotel rooms are only good
for one thing, Nick.

07:40.888 --> 07:42.048
Smells like trouble.

07:46.561 --> 07:49.689
It would kill me to be that close
to the limelight and not be a part of it.

07:49.764 --> 07:51.322
I'm sorry. I pass.

07:51.432 --> 07:52.456
Darling farms.

07:55.603 --> 07:58.094
I like the crazy boots,
but, come on, dude.

07:58.172 --> 07:59.935
Cows, they're scary.

08:01.809 --> 08:04.243
Darling pharmaceuticals.

08:04.312 --> 08:05.745
Let's skip this one.

08:05.813 --> 08:07.872
Darling developments.
23 office towers,

08:07.949 --> 08:10.918
62 apartment buildings,
10,000 residents.

08:10.985 --> 08:13.715
Can I be, like, the janitor or something?
Like the fix-it guy?

08:13.788 --> 08:16.086
Well, what exactly can you fix?

08:17.625 --> 08:19.252
Okay. That's a good point.

08:19.327 --> 08:20.988
Jeremy, I'll tell you what.

08:21.062 --> 08:23.428
Why don't we start
with what you're good at?

08:23.498 --> 08:26.467
Well, I've always had
this uncanny ability to just chill.

08:26.534 --> 08:29.765
You know, like, I can be sitting
in a chair, and it's 2:00.

08:29.837 --> 08:33.203
Next thing I know, boom! 4:00.

08:33.307 --> 08:36.071
So zoning out, that's your special skill?

08:36.143 --> 08:38.043
- I can drive a car.
- That's not a special skill.

08:38.111 --> 08:40.171
Oh, it is the way I drive.

08:42.250 --> 08:46.118
Oh, God.
I always forget how long this takes.

08:46.187 --> 08:49.645
Bureaucracy
just another name for mediocrity

08:50.858 --> 08:52.621
baby, you're gonna need to stop that.

08:52.727 --> 08:54.251
Karen Darling.

08:55.263 --> 08:56.628
That's me!

08:58.099 --> 09:02.559
- Hey, it's you! How nice to see you!
- Nice to see you again, miss Darling.

09:02.637 --> 09:05.105
- Is this number three? Four?
- Four.

09:05.172 --> 09:08.403
But he's number one in my heart.

09:08.476 --> 09:10.103
Of course he is. Uh-oh.

09:10.378 --> 09:11.345
"Uh-oh. "

09:11.879 --> 09:14.245
- Is there a problem?
- Unfortunately, yes.

09:14.315 --> 09:17.773
Polyandry's illegal in New York state.

09:17.852 --> 09:20.787
- What did you just call me?
- Freddy, relax.

09:20.855 --> 09:22.720
What did you just call him?

09:22.790 --> 09:25.554
Miss Darling, you're still married.

09:25.626 --> 09:29.995
- To whom?
- Your last husband, Sebastian fleet.

09:30.097 --> 09:32.531
No, we were divorced,
like, three years ago.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.727
He never signed the papers.

09:35.903 --> 09:38.633
You're gonna need to take care of this.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.665
Paul cotley!
- Baby?

09:46.447 --> 09:51.214
No. Clark, tell Patrick
the drive-through window is closed.

09:51.285 --> 09:55.244
Ma'am, if you could just get in the car.
Please? It's important.

10:03.197 --> 10:04.960
So, what do you want?

10:06.601 --> 10:07.898
Here.

10:07.969 --> 10:10.460
- What are these?
- Pictures.

10:16.177 --> 10:18.270
You hired that photographer?

10:18.346 --> 10:21.247
I've tried and tried
to make it clear to Patrick

10:21.315 --> 10:23.249
just how much he stands to lose

10:23.317 --> 10:26.684
by maintaining this alliance,
but to no avail. None.

10:27.688 --> 10:32.022
So I find myself compelled
to rely upon your good judgment

10:32.093 --> 10:34.118
and the support of

10:35.830 --> 10:38.765
this sadly necessary object lesson.

10:38.833 --> 10:41.165
How long do you think it will be
before paddy's opponent sends

10:41.235 --> 10:45.467
someone after the two of you
to document this embarrassment?

10:45.539 --> 10:48.872
How long, honestly,
do you think this can endure?

10:48.943 --> 10:51.104
I've thought the same thing.

10:54.749 --> 10:57.513
There's a cashier's check
in this envelope

10:57.618 --> 11:02.146
for considerably more money
than you will require to relocate.

11:02.223 --> 11:05.784
Anywhere. And believe me,
no one knows better than I do

11:05.860 --> 11:09.091
that money is cold comfort
in the absence of love.

11:10.598 --> 11:14.500
So it is with the utmost compassion

11:16.203 --> 11:17.727
and goodwill

11:18.606 --> 11:21.905
that I appeal
to whatever genuine feelings

11:21.976 --> 11:25.935
you have for my son,
and implore you to let him go.

11:27.114 --> 11:29.844
This liaison is impossible.

11:32.019 --> 11:34.579
Mr. Darling. Tripp?

11:34.689 --> 11:35.986
Tripp.

11:36.057 --> 11:40.426
I am a living, breathing testament
to the fact that nothing,

11:40.528 --> 11:42.996
and I mean nothing, is impossible.

11:44.465 --> 11:46.763
I'm gonna do you the favor
of not telling Patrick

11:46.834 --> 11:49.394
we had this conversation,

11:49.503 --> 11:51.937
because he would be terribly hurt.

11:52.740 --> 11:55.174
And that's the last thing I want.

11:57.678 --> 12:00.408
I see where Patrick
gets his good looks.

12:07.221 --> 12:09.155
So, I'd manage the whole structure?

12:09.223 --> 12:11.282
No, you'd be working here.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.520
- Parking cars.
- Right.

12:15.629 --> 12:19.292
You start at the bottom,
common-man style. I forgot about that.

12:19.366 --> 12:20.856
And you'll be working for this man.

12:20.935 --> 12:22.994
Lou mack,
I want you to meet Jeremy Darling.

12:23.070 --> 12:27.439
- Hello, Lou. I recognize you.
- I was your doorman for eight years.

12:27.541 --> 12:31.671
You were! I didn't recognize you
without the epaulets.

12:31.746 --> 12:34.681
Lou is my boss. I love it. Full circle.

12:35.149 --> 12:36.582
Does everyone get a clipboard?

12:39.220 --> 12:43.179
- Nick George.
- Nick, it's Simon elder.

12:43.257 --> 12:46.090
You know, your dad got me
into this crazy poker game tomorrow.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.252
Yeah, Tripp told me.

12:47.328 --> 12:49.694
Personally, I think
this whole thing is distasteful.

12:49.764 --> 12:52.528
A bunch of puffed-up peacocks,
gambling away people's homes

12:52.633 --> 12:55.693
and offices
as if life were no more than...

12:55.770 --> 12:58.034
A card game?
- Yeah. Right.

12:58.105 --> 13:01.268
But sometimes a little
distasteful behavior is necessary.

13:01.375 --> 13:02.740
Your point being?

13:02.843 --> 13:06.506
Well, there's a reason
Dutch made this happen for me.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.104
We had a plan.

13:11.685 --> 13:15.143
You know, when Robert Moses
redesigned New York City

13:15.222 --> 13:18.783
for the automobile,
a lot of good came from his work.

13:18.893 --> 13:21.862
- And a lot of bad.
- I agree.

13:21.929 --> 13:25.160
He made this whole city
much more unlivable.

13:25.232 --> 13:28.599
I envision a new Manhattan,
with cleaner air,

13:28.702 --> 13:29.999
better public transportation.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.697
And your dad,

13:32.473 --> 13:35.704
your dad was going
to help make my vision a reality.

13:35.776 --> 13:36.936
I see.

13:39.079 --> 13:41.240
So, what do you want from me?

13:41.315 --> 13:44.876
At some point, the stakes
for the game tomorrow will get so high

13:44.952 --> 13:46.385
that cash will no longer be enough.

13:46.453 --> 13:49.217
Real estate will become
the new currency.

13:50.391 --> 13:53.952
And what I want from you
is very simple.

13:54.061 --> 13:58.157
Convince Tripp to throw Darling Plaza
into the pot.

13:59.633 --> 14:01.999
What part does an 80-year-old,
15-story building play

14:02.102 --> 14:04.468
- in the revitalization of New York City?
- Don't worry about that, Nick.

14:04.538 --> 14:06.631
You just get that piece of land
in the pot,

14:06.707 --> 14:08.538
and I will win that hand.

14:08.609 --> 14:10.236
What do you say?

14:11.712 --> 14:14.078
I don't think so.

14:14.181 --> 14:15.409
I'm not sure Tripp would go for it,

14:15.482 --> 14:17.814
and, frankly, I don't know
if you're telling me the truth.

14:17.885 --> 14:19.910
- About?
- About my father.

14:20.821 --> 14:22.254
That's fair.

14:23.490 --> 14:24.923
That's fair.

14:29.663 --> 14:33.497
I heard you got the clean ntsb report
on your dad's plane crash.

14:35.736 --> 14:38.170
You should know
that report was doctored

14:38.239 --> 14:41.072
long before the police ever got it.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.439
- Really?
- It's a fake.

14:43.510 --> 14:44.875
A fake?

14:44.979 --> 14:48.540
Now, if you really want to find out
who killed your dad, you do this for me.

14:48.649 --> 14:54.144
And I'll get the real report for you.
Just think about it, okay?

14:56.690 --> 14:57.816
Okay?

15:09.932 --> 15:12.230
All right, tobey looked at me,
he's freaking out.

15:12.301 --> 15:15.464
I said, "man, you have no choice.
You have to be spidey. "

15:15.537 --> 15:17.300
I taught him this action.

15:18.707 --> 15:20.766
The rest is movie history.

15:23.245 --> 15:24.769
I got this one.

15:40.996 --> 15:44.557
Hey, Jules, you will not believe
the girl whose car I'm parking.

15:44.633 --> 15:47.534
- Be careful.
- No need. I'm a vehicular ninja.

15:47.670 --> 15:50.696
I'm talking about your heart.
You are on the rebound.

15:50.773 --> 15:52.331
I'm just parking her car.

15:52.641 --> 15:54.108
Do you know
where your binoculars are?

15:54.176 --> 15:55.837
Little Brian needs them for polo.

15:57.012 --> 15:59.071
Jeremy? Jeremy?

15:59.348 --> 16:01.441
Nick, I need you to come with me.

16:01.517 --> 16:03.678
Well, Karen, if I go with you,
then your ex is gonna want

16:03.786 --> 16:05.879
- to have his lawyer come with him...
- Never bring a lawyer

16:05.955 --> 16:09.288
- if you don't have to.
- Exactly. Just go get divorced.

16:09.358 --> 16:12.020
No, but, Nick, I can't face him alone.

16:12.094 --> 16:14.062
- You know Sebastian.
- No, Karen, I don't.

16:14.163 --> 16:16.324
Hey, Daisy, where are the rest
of the real estate files?

16:16.398 --> 16:18.923
Which ones? Darling Plaza,
Darling financial center, the hotels?

16:19.001 --> 16:20.059
All of them. I need all of them.

16:21.270 --> 16:24.762
- All right, so, Sebastian...
- Yes. Sebastian fleet.

16:25.107 --> 16:26.836
World-renowned anthropologist?

16:26.909 --> 16:29.207
People's sexiest man alive?

16:29.278 --> 16:31.508
In the anthropology category, yes.

16:32.414 --> 16:34.041
- He's got a pretty incredible heinie.
- I know.

16:34.116 --> 16:35.481
Thank you for that, Daisy.

16:35.551 --> 16:37.985
He's got a hold on me, Nick.

16:38.053 --> 16:40.988
It's magnetic. It's electric. It's sexual.

16:41.056 --> 16:43.286
- I get it, Karen.
- I will eat him alive.

16:43.359 --> 16:44.383
You're getting married in three months!

16:44.460 --> 16:46.985
- I know!
- So exercise a little self-control.

16:47.062 --> 16:48.927
What if I can't?

16:48.998 --> 16:52.024
What if I cheat on Freddy, and he...
And, oh, God... and he dumps me?

16:52.101 --> 16:53.068
Well, that sex tape you made

16:53.168 --> 16:54.999
- with his caddy didn't seem to faze him.
- Oh, I know!

16:55.070 --> 16:57.732
But, Sebastian and I, we were married.

17:00.976 --> 17:04.002
- He activates my yoni.
- Karen, I'm not coming.

17:07.215 --> 17:09.184
Fine. Okay. Yeah, don't.

17:10.519 --> 17:13.682
But letting me risk ruining my marriage
to Freddy

17:13.789 --> 17:16.952
sure makes it seem
like you want me free for you,

17:17.192 --> 17:19.455
and that's selfish.

17:19.528 --> 17:21.018
Thanks, Nick.

17:23.464 --> 17:25.626
If Nick doesn't find
these pictures, I'm screwed.

17:25.733 --> 17:27.065
Come on, Nick, Nick, Nick...

17:28.303 --> 17:29.861
Nick's not answering.

17:29.938 --> 17:32.429
- Patrick, you need to relax.
- Relax?

17:32.508 --> 17:34.874
The story could break any second.
My whole life could go up in flames.

17:34.943 --> 17:36.808
You want me to relax?

17:36.879 --> 17:38.642
The story's not gonna break.

17:38.714 --> 17:40.739
How could you be so sure?

17:45.988 --> 17:48.752
- Are you insane?
- I want what's best for you.

17:48.824 --> 17:51.691
Oh, so you wanna buy off the woman
that I love, behind my back?

17:51.760 --> 17:54.422
You do not know yourself well enough
to manage...

17:54.496 --> 17:56.760
I don't need to know myself, dad!
I know you!

17:56.832 --> 17:58.390
When are you gonna
get it through your thick skull

17:58.467 --> 17:59.764
that you can't control me anymore?

17:59.835 --> 18:03.396
Patrick, when your Uncle Kenneth
was taken from us,

18:05.007 --> 18:06.975
your destiny was sealed.

18:07.042 --> 18:10.534
It is my deepest, most heartfelt belief

18:12.147 --> 18:16.243
that a moment is coming in history
when you, Patrick, you,

18:16.318 --> 18:20.277
will play an important role
in the unfolding mystery

18:20.355 --> 18:21.481
of human freedom.

18:21.557 --> 18:23.923
That's what politics is.

18:23.992 --> 18:27.155
That's what you need
to be a part of. Freedom.

18:27.262 --> 18:29.230
Not license.

18:30.799 --> 18:33.233
And you should know
that she promised me

18:33.302 --> 18:36.237
that she would not tell you about this.

18:36.305 --> 18:38.330
I'm glad that she did.

18:38.407 --> 18:41.342
No, Patrick. You don't understand.

18:41.410 --> 18:43.935
She lied to me.

18:44.012 --> 18:47.311
She lies. She can't be trusted.

18:47.382 --> 18:51.546
"She"? You're the one that's not to be
trusted! You know what? We're done!

18:51.653 --> 18:55.817
- Patrick.
- You're sick, dad. You are unwell.

18:55.924 --> 18:58.484
I am tired of it all.
The money, the advice, the support.

18:58.594 --> 19:00.755
All of it. We are done.

19:02.598 --> 19:03.963
I mean it.

19:10.639 --> 19:12.766
What do you guys think?

19:12.841 --> 19:14.741
I think you're screwed, man.

19:14.810 --> 19:18.940
Man, I knew I should have
learned how to fix stuff!

19:19.014 --> 19:21.175
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Don't worry, man.

19:21.250 --> 19:23.013
- Hey...
- Don't worry, man.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.678
At least they can't fire you, right?

19:26.421 --> 19:27.683
I got it.

19:29.391 --> 19:32.224
Hey, Jeremy!
Where you going, dude?

19:32.294 --> 19:33.852
I know how to fix it!

19:46.909 --> 19:49.377
Sorry about the wait.
I just wanted to get it washed for you.

19:49.444 --> 19:53.380
Oh, that's so sweet.
No tip. Maybe next time.

19:57.252 --> 19:59.743
How did you get it fixed in 30 minutes?

19:59.821 --> 20:02.346
Bought her a new car,
changed the plates.

20:02.424 --> 20:03.789
When's the lunch break?

20:05.327 --> 20:07.386
- No, no.
- This one?

20:07.462 --> 20:09.692
- No, no. I hate that.
- I don't know. Mustard?

20:09.765 --> 20:12.029
Oh, Nick.
Could I have a word with you?

20:12.100 --> 20:15.763
No, no. I like red, but we're not
doing a monsoon wedding.

20:18.140 --> 20:22.577
I need you to keep an eye on Tripp
at the all-important game.

20:22.644 --> 20:23.611
Okay.

20:23.712 --> 20:25.646
He gets very competitive
with that crowd.

20:25.714 --> 20:26.942
He'd never admit it, but he does.

20:27.015 --> 20:29.347
If someone puts him up to a dare,
he'll take it.

20:29.418 --> 20:31.283
He will not walk away from a bet.

20:31.353 --> 20:35.813
So, I need you to make sure that he...
Well, he doesn't make a fool of himself.

20:35.891 --> 20:37.825
Has he done that before?

20:37.893 --> 20:39.861
- See this finger?
- Yes.

20:39.928 --> 20:43.227
Upon this finger do you see
the most valuable emerald

20:43.298 --> 20:45.425
in the world?

20:45.500 --> 20:47.991
He lost it last year at the game.

20:48.070 --> 20:49.094
I'll keep an eye on him.

20:50.672 --> 20:52.640
- You got the deeds?
- Right here.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.972
It's gonna be a real good game.

20:55.043 --> 20:57.204
What did you round up for me
to bet with?

20:57.312 --> 20:59.803
Foundry's bringing half of Harlem.

20:59.881 --> 21:02.782
Mostly just what you talked about,
the building on fifth

21:02.851 --> 21:06.412
and a few smaller hotels.
Darling Plaza. Listen now, Tripp,

21:06.488 --> 21:09.013
- I know that since we're...
- Hang on. Hang on.

21:09.091 --> 21:10.718
Darling Plaza?

21:10.792 --> 21:13.352
No. No, no, no.

21:14.062 --> 21:17.395
Darling Plaza was our first home
in Manhattan.

21:17.466 --> 21:19.934
It was a gift.
Letitia's father gave it to me.

21:20.002 --> 21:22.334
Patrick and Karen were born there.

21:22.404 --> 21:26.135
I wouldn't sell it,
let alone risk it on a game of cards.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.301
Tripp, the fact
that it's that important to you

21:28.377 --> 21:30.470
could be useful as a bluff.

21:30.545 --> 21:34.276
Nick, what's going on?
I said Darling Plaza's off the table.

21:34.349 --> 21:37.682
It's off the table. I don't understand.
What's got into you?

21:38.820 --> 21:40.685
Let's take a little trip

21:41.156 --> 21:43.716
down where we used to go

21:43.925 --> 21:46.393
it's way beyond the strip

21:46.495 --> 21:48.827
a place they call your soul

21:48.897 --> 21:52.355
we'll sit down for a while
and let the evening...

21:52.434 --> 21:53.594
Karen?

21:54.936 --> 21:56.836
Sebastian.

21:56.905 --> 21:58.873
- You were showering?
- No.

22:01.109 --> 22:02.599
Can you sign these, please?

22:02.678 --> 22:04.578
They put these sweet little stickies
on here,

22:04.646 --> 22:08.207
so you know just where to put your
John han... hancock.

22:08.283 --> 22:10.979
You look beautiful. As always.

22:12.587 --> 22:15.954
Sign, please? Just sign these.

22:16.024 --> 22:17.651
I'm not sure
what went wrong here, Karen.

22:17.726 --> 22:20.286
I signed those the first time around.

22:20.362 --> 22:21.454
- You did?
- Mmm-hmm.

22:21.530 --> 22:23.657
I gave them to that, what,
guy from the Netherlands.

22:23.732 --> 22:26.098
Netherlands? Oh, you mean Dutch?

22:27.669 --> 22:29.227
You signed them,
and you gave them to Dutch?

22:29.304 --> 22:31.795
Yeah, that guy.
No problem. I'll sign them again.

22:31.873 --> 22:33.602
Do you want to come in, have a drink?

22:33.675 --> 22:36.838
Warm you a little cocoa tea from Peru.
It's quite relaxing.

22:36.912 --> 22:38.436
See, I see what you're doing here.

22:38.513 --> 22:39.844
I'm not doing anything, Karen,

22:39.915 --> 22:43.749
besides asking my wife to come in
and make herself comfortable.

22:44.186 --> 22:45.448
Come in.

22:48.290 --> 22:49.814
Have some tea.

22:51.293 --> 22:55.320
- Oh, you lost your towel.
- No. It tastes better naked.

22:55.397 --> 22:56.762
I remember.

22:56.898 --> 22:59.332
With music as our guide

22:59.501 --> 23:01.969
we'll raise our ready hands

23:02.104 --> 23:04.163
and let go for the ride

23:04.272 --> 23:05.500
Simon.

23:05.574 --> 23:06.905
I guess I'm late.

23:06.975 --> 23:08.499
Simon elder.

23:09.578 --> 23:10.943
Nice to see you again.

23:11.012 --> 23:13.378
Hey, I've been meaning to tell you
how sorry I am.

23:13.482 --> 23:15.245
- Sorry?
- About Dutch.

23:16.451 --> 23:20.012
But you're lucky
'cause you got this guy on your team.

23:21.156 --> 23:23.090
You're right there.

23:23.492 --> 23:27.019
I am lucky. I am extremely lucky.

23:27.929 --> 23:29.863
Ready to play some cards?

23:30.465 --> 23:31.830
Absolutely.

23:41.271 --> 23:42.966
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:43.774 --> 23:46.868
I guess I should sign these now, huh?

23:48.578 --> 23:51.308
Hey. Oh, you're finally marrying
Nick George, huh?

23:51.381 --> 23:54.316
Yeah, Nick. Wait. No. No.

23:54.384 --> 23:57.615
No, no, no, no. Not Nick.

23:58.054 --> 24:00.022
What are you talking about?
His name's all over this thing.

24:00.123 --> 24:04.617
Yeah, because Nick's my lawyer.
I'm marrying Freddy. He's a golfer.

24:04.694 --> 24:05.854
Oh...

24:05.962 --> 24:08.624
So, you're gonna do it all over again
to somebody else.

24:08.698 --> 24:09.960
Do what?

24:11.301 --> 24:13.997
Nothing. You just be happy.

24:15.539 --> 24:18.508
Sebastian, we were happy.

24:19.643 --> 24:22.407
- Why didn't it work out with us?
- Oh, come on. I was never around.

24:22.479 --> 24:25.107
I was always out somewhere,
eating psychogenic plants

24:25.182 --> 24:27.241
or doing ritual circumcisions.

24:27.317 --> 24:29.444
Right. That's right.

24:29.519 --> 24:32.886
Even when I was here,
I was never Nick.

24:34.291 --> 24:36.054
That was part of it.

24:38.395 --> 24:39.885
There you go.

24:43.567 --> 24:46.001
It was nice being married to you.

24:47.504 --> 24:50.632
And it was nice being married
to you, too, Karen.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.433
It really was.

25:04.821 --> 25:06.379
Oh, come on. What are you turkeys
doing in my room?

25:06.490 --> 25:08.185
- Get out.
- Dude, this is my game.

25:08.258 --> 25:10.123
Little squirt Jr. must have brought it
in here.

25:10.193 --> 25:11.717
Hey, have you seen him?
He was supposed to be back

25:11.795 --> 25:12.955
with Juliet an hour ago.

25:15.398 --> 25:17.764
- Crash!
- The great gazoo here wrecked a car

25:17.868 --> 25:21.031
- his first day on the job.
- Hey, it's all good. I replaced it.

25:21.104 --> 25:23.265
- She didn't even notice.
- Well, aren't you bothered at all?

25:23.340 --> 25:25.433
Doesn't your conscience
feel the tiniest prick?

25:25.509 --> 25:28.535
Not until you walked in, Brian.
I'm still not really feeling it.

25:30.981 --> 25:32.539
Damn it!

25:32.649 --> 25:33.877
Damn it!

25:34.851 --> 25:38.309
- Oh, you want some punishment?
- Dream on.

25:38.388 --> 25:40.049
Come on, Brian.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.353
Everybody in this family
gets away with everything but me.

25:42.425 --> 25:43.983
Oh, yeah. Can you see these calluses?

25:44.094 --> 25:45.721
They're from gripping steering wheels
all day.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.319
Please. I'm running for senate,

25:47.397 --> 25:49.627
and my whole life's being run
like a puppet show by dad.

25:49.699 --> 25:51.860
You see? You see? Nobody gets away
with anything around here.

25:51.935 --> 25:54.563
Your crap just finally caught up
with you.

25:55.839 --> 25:58.399
- Where's Juliet?
- She dropped me off.

25:59.276 --> 26:01.335
Pay dirt! Suck it!

26:02.512 --> 26:05.174
- Still the king.
- Get it, baby. Get it!

26:07.918 --> 26:11.615
- I'm gonna miss this place.
- What, when you go to Washington?

26:12.155 --> 26:14.919
Yeah, when I go to Washington.

26:20.864 --> 26:22.024
Raise.

26:27.938 --> 26:30.372
I'm not feeling self-destructive.

26:31.207 --> 26:33.334
80 million to you, sir.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.711
Well, I guess now's the time

26:37.814 --> 26:40.681
to take this baby
to the next level, right?

26:44.187 --> 26:46.212
Woodmere Plaza,

26:46.289 --> 26:48.723
two connected retail buildings
on Broadway.

26:48.792 --> 26:53.092
Appraised last week at 101 million.

26:59.369 --> 27:01.337
Darling financial center...

27:03.974 --> 27:07.273
- How about Darling Plaza?
- We discussed this, Nick.

27:07.344 --> 27:08.709
There's no reason
to bet the farm, Tripp.

27:08.778 --> 27:09.836
You're out of line, Nick.

27:09.913 --> 27:13.041
Maybe, but I can't advise
staking your most profitable building.

27:13.116 --> 27:16.608
I told you not even to bring
the damn deed to the boat.

27:22.626 --> 27:26.289
Tripp, don't confuse sentimentality
with business.

27:26.363 --> 27:28.729
Darling Plaza hasn't made money
in years.

27:31.835 --> 27:33.200
Don't confuse the price with the...

27:33.303 --> 27:34.770
With the value of the thing.

27:34.838 --> 27:36.806
I got it.

27:36.873 --> 27:39.637
Now, look, the building is paralyzed
by rent control until 2010.

27:39.743 --> 27:42.234
It needs over $ 10 million worth
of structural improvements.

27:42.312 --> 27:44.371
How many times
do I have to explain this to you?

27:44.447 --> 27:45.914
- Would you just trust me, Tripp?
- Nick...

27:45.982 --> 27:48.212
Trust me.

27:48.284 --> 27:49.774
Just trust me.

27:51.054 --> 27:53.522
Come on, Darling. Pony up.

27:59.396 --> 28:03.059
Look, all you have to do
is win the hand,

28:03.133 --> 28:05.294
and you won't lose anything.

28:13.109 --> 28:15.634
Unless you don't think you can win.

28:36.066 --> 28:37.556
Darling Plaza.

28:40.170 --> 28:41.535
Sorry, I'm late.

28:41.604 --> 28:43.265
Oh, she's here.
Where have you been?

28:43.339 --> 28:46.035
Oh, getting my divorce.

28:46.109 --> 28:49.442
- And how is Sebastian?
- Fine. Same as ever.

28:51.247 --> 28:52.544
Perfect.

28:53.383 --> 28:56.409
- Would you excuse us, please?
Oh, absolutely.

28:59.289 --> 29:01.723
- Tell me you didn't.
- I didn't.

29:03.126 --> 29:06.493
- I didn't!
- You are unbelievable.

29:06.563 --> 29:09.191
He wasn't going to sign otherwise.
I had to.

29:09.265 --> 29:11.165
How do you expect
to make a fresh start with Freddy

29:11.234 --> 29:12.258
if you're still sleeping

29:12.335 --> 29:14.496
- with your ex-husband?
- He wasn't my ex-husband

29:14.571 --> 29:16.471
at the actual time of the coupling.

29:16.539 --> 29:19.303
- We were technically still married.
- Karen, your behavior...

29:19.375 --> 29:21.138
Is what it is. Fine.

29:22.412 --> 29:25.779
I wouldn't have had to go over there
and behave at all if it wasn't for you.

29:25.849 --> 29:27.373
And what does that mean?

29:27.450 --> 29:30.783
- Dutch never filed the papers.
- And how is that my fault?

29:30.854 --> 29:33.584
Why, I'm sure when he was supposed
to be filing them, he was in some hotel,

29:33.656 --> 29:36.819
doing to you
what Sebastian just did to me.

29:40.530 --> 29:42.498
Don't be disgusting.

29:42.599 --> 29:45.261
- I'm not the one who's disgusting.
- Look, I know what you think of me.

29:45.335 --> 29:47.428
But don't you think it kills me
to see you making

29:47.504 --> 29:49.529
- the same mistakes I did?
- What mistakes?

29:49.606 --> 29:53.440
- Putting three people in your marriage.
- Mother, I divorced Sebastian.

29:53.510 --> 29:57.037
I'm not talking about Sebastian.
I'm talking about Nick.

30:00.517 --> 30:01.745
I call.

30:03.052 --> 30:04.349
Wilkes housing project.

30:04.420 --> 30:07.981
The pot now contains over $400 million
in cash and property.

30:08.057 --> 30:11.185
No more bets, so we stay
under 500 million as agreed.

30:11.261 --> 30:12.626
River card.

30:16.432 --> 30:17.797
Gentlemen?

30:20.937 --> 30:22.199
Straight.

30:27.510 --> 30:29.205
Flush. All hearts.

30:38.321 --> 30:40.289
Mr. elder wins the hand.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.391
- Well done.
- And to you. And to you.

30:43.459 --> 30:45.689
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:45.762 --> 30:48.287
- Tripp, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

30:48.364 --> 30:49.991
I don't know what else to say.

30:50.066 --> 30:53.968
Well, you can say to my wife
that I've lost the building

30:54.037 --> 30:56.767
that we spent the first seven years
of our marriage in.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.501
No, I...

30:58.575 --> 31:00.440
I'll say it to her.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.377
And I don't want to see you
for a few days.

31:04.414 --> 31:07.042
Could I have a double scotch, please?

31:18.756 --> 31:21.725
I'm telling you, bridget, Kate's so...

31:21.826 --> 31:24.386
- Bye, bridget.
- Hello?

31:24.495 --> 31:27.555
Did you buy my son a $30,000 watch?

31:27.632 --> 31:28.894
It was 15%/ off.

31:28.967 --> 31:30.525
Are you out of your mind?

31:30.635 --> 31:32.102
- No!
- You're spoiling him rotten.

31:32.170 --> 31:33.865
All he does is walk around now
and mouth off

31:33.938 --> 31:35.496
- and ask for expensive things!
- Well...

31:35.573 --> 31:37.905
You've turned
a nice fake Swedish orphan

31:37.976 --> 31:39.443
into your own personal living doll.

31:39.510 --> 31:43.446
- And a watch? He can't even tell time.
- He asked for it, you jerk!

31:43.514 --> 31:46.677
He only wanted a patek Philippe
'cause that's what you wear.

31:46.751 --> 31:49.447
I've been just trying to
make him feel like part of the family.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.578
I love hanging out with him,

31:50.655 --> 31:52.623
but you're the one
he's always talking about.

31:52.724 --> 31:53.850
I don't have time for this.

31:53.925 --> 31:56.393
You don't have time for him!

31:59.898 --> 32:02.958
Well, look who's back
in her brand new ride.

32:03.034 --> 32:04.797
Oh, this is a sign.

32:07.672 --> 32:09.902
Hello. Welcome back.

32:13.411 --> 32:16.175
Can I talk to you for a second?

32:17.282 --> 32:18.408
- Sure.
- Okay.

32:18.483 --> 32:21.919
I'm just gonna come right out
and say this.

32:21.986 --> 32:24.147
This isn't your car.

32:24.255 --> 32:26.120
- I just drove it from home.
- Oh, I know,

32:26.190 --> 32:28.681
but that is... that is your car.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.888
- Then whose car is this?
- This is a rental.

32:31.963 --> 32:34.431
I was gonna switch it
after I got the other one fixed,

32:34.499 --> 32:38.435
but, you know, it felt wrong to do,
in the interest of full disclosure,

32:38.503 --> 32:40.061
'cause I'm in this phase in my life

32:40.171 --> 32:42.537
where I'm kind of
seeking consequences, and...

32:42.640 --> 32:45.165
Do you want to talk to my boss?

32:47.078 --> 32:48.841
No, it's okay.

32:48.913 --> 32:51.381
You told the truth. That's enough.

32:52.216 --> 32:54.184
As long as you fix my car today.

32:54.285 --> 32:56.515
- No problem. Thank you.
- Okay.

32:59.190 --> 33:02.887
Can I buy you dinner sometime?

33:05.263 --> 33:06.730
That's sweet.

33:07.932 --> 33:11.265
But you're not my type. Sorry.

33:16.107 --> 33:17.597
Why did you say you rented it?

33:17.675 --> 33:19.905
Why didn't you just tell her
you bought the car?

33:19.978 --> 33:21.843
I didn't want her to know.

33:21.913 --> 33:24.882
Know what?
That you're Jeremy Darling?

33:24.983 --> 33:27.315
That's the ultimate closer, man.

33:28.753 --> 33:30.220
Yeah, I know.

33:34.058 --> 33:36.583
I thought I told you to keep an eye
on my husband.

33:36.661 --> 33:38.959
- Look, things got a little out of hand.
- A little?

33:39.030 --> 33:41.294
You let him gamble away
the one building of ours

33:41.366 --> 33:43.334
that actually meant something to me.

33:43.434 --> 33:44.799
Your father never would have
done that.

33:44.869 --> 33:47.702
But, Letitia, I'm not my father.
And that's, you know, a good thing.

33:47.772 --> 33:50.240
- He was far from perfect.
- I know that.

33:50.308 --> 33:53.675
But he protected me.
He protected all of us from

33:55.179 --> 33:56.874
Tripp's whims.

33:59.150 --> 34:03.052
It was a comfort, and I miss it.
That's all.

34:03.121 --> 34:05.681
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. You're right to push back.

34:05.790 --> 34:08.156
You know,

34:08.226 --> 34:10.989
your father and I, it's funny,
we always felt

34:11.094 --> 34:13.757
that we were sacrificing so much.

34:15.433 --> 34:19.893
But I guess everybody was,
knowingly or unknowingly.

34:19.971 --> 34:22.906
We were all having
something stolen from us.

34:25.643 --> 34:29.601
You know, I really don't know
who's in control anymore, or what.

34:31.014 --> 34:34.109
For Tripp to have gambled away
that building...

34:35.987 --> 34:38.683
Well, it mustn't mean as much to him
as it once did.

34:38.755 --> 34:41.384
And that's not your fault. It's mine.

34:54.705 --> 34:58.368
I came as soon as I could.
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.

35:00.711 --> 35:02.679
Are you gonna miss this place?

35:02.747 --> 35:06.080
I am, actually. A little bit.

35:06.150 --> 35:09.779
I shouldn't, you know? Sitting bull said,

35:09.854 --> 35:14.587
"the love of possession
is a disease with them. "

35:14.659 --> 35:17.025
With us. And it is. He was right.

35:18.362 --> 35:25.029
So I try to see
that my ownership of land and property

35:25.103 --> 35:30.541
is part of a larger, creative project,

35:31.309 --> 35:33.368
and I have tried not to

35:34.912 --> 35:37.676
be attached.

35:40.351 --> 35:41.716
It's done.

35:43.421 --> 35:45.446
How's Jeremy doing?

35:45.523 --> 35:47.684
Good. He's working
for Darling parking.

35:47.758 --> 35:53.458
You know why I asked you to walk him
around the company, don't you?

35:53.531 --> 35:55.795
I assume to get him a job.

35:55.867 --> 35:57.391
No.

35:57.468 --> 36:01.427
I wanted you to see all the aspects
of the company

36:01.506 --> 36:03.406
that you are going to run one day.

36:03.474 --> 36:07.501
Now, it's not anything we have to
talk about right now. I just

36:08.846 --> 36:12.907
wanted you to know that,
that's what my wish is.

36:16.654 --> 36:17.746
So,

36:19.323 --> 36:21.382
when are you gonna
meet with Simon elder

36:21.459 --> 36:24.292
and get that ntsb report?

36:24.362 --> 36:26.057
Tonight.

36:26.130 --> 36:27.654
Tonight?

36:29.367 --> 36:31.130
Thank you, Tripp,

36:32.436 --> 36:34.666
for letting this place go.

36:34.739 --> 36:37.708
Darling Plaza was our first home
in Manhattan.

36:39.610 --> 36:43.273
I wouldn't sell it,
let alone risk it on a game of cards.

36:43.347 --> 36:45.679
Tripp, the fact
that it's so important to you

36:45.750 --> 36:47.843
could be useful as a bluff.

36:47.919 --> 36:51.582
Nick, what's going on?
I said Darling Plaza's off the table.

36:51.656 --> 36:55.422
It's off the table. I don't understand.
What's got into you?

36:58.829 --> 37:00.387
Simon elder told me

37:00.498 --> 37:02.261
that if I could get this property
in the game,

37:02.366 --> 37:05.995
that he would get me
the real ntsb report on dad's plane.

37:06.437 --> 37:09.406
He said the original one
had been doctored.

37:09.507 --> 37:11.668
- And you believe him?
- I do.

37:11.776 --> 37:13.903
I'm not sure why, but I do.

37:14.412 --> 37:17.074
But why Darling Plaza?

37:17.148 --> 37:21.107
You know, he didn't really say.
Just that it's part of some plan.

37:21.219 --> 37:24.586
How do we know that
he isn't somehow the one responsible

37:24.689 --> 37:26.316
for doctoring the ntsb report?

37:26.390 --> 37:28.290
How do we know he wasn't implicated
in the crash?

37:28.359 --> 37:30.088
He may be,

37:30.161 --> 37:33.528
but if I can get him to trust me,
I'll have a way in.

37:33.831 --> 37:36.299
And having someone
with inside access to Simon elder

37:36.367 --> 37:39.131
would not be bad
for Darling enterprises,

37:39.437 --> 37:43.203
especially if he thinks that you and I
are at odds with one another.

37:43.307 --> 37:45.434
You and me, at odds?

37:49.280 --> 37:50.907
- Okay.
- You in?

37:50.982 --> 37:52.279
Let's do it.

37:53.184 --> 37:54.879
I love you, Nicky.

37:56.454 --> 38:00.823
I want to find out who killed Dutch
just as much as you do, maybe more.

38:02.360 --> 38:06.057
I told you I would do everything it took.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.586
- There you go.
Thanks, Katherine.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.788
Oh, and can I have
some vanilla ice cream?

38:19.864 --> 38:20.956
Okay.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.996
Things are gonna be changing
around here, buddy.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.127
- Like what?
- Like less time with aunt Juliet,

38:26.204 --> 38:28.229
more time with me.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.137
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.971
But don't look so happy about it.

38:32.043 --> 38:35.706
No more watches,
no more fancy clothes.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.544
Just some good, old-fashioned,
father-son time.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.777
What happens during
good, old-fashioned, father-son time?

38:41.853 --> 38:44.151
I don't know yet. I never had any.

38:44.222 --> 38:46.452
You could teach me backgammon.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.683
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.627
Let me show you something. See,

38:56.567 --> 38:59.400
you cut a hole
in the center of the stack,

39:00.538 --> 39:04.497
otherwise you only get syrup
on the top pancake.

39:04.575 --> 39:08.238
It's a special syrup distribution method

39:08.312 --> 39:10.371
I developed in the seminary.

39:10.448 --> 39:11.415
Oh.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.975
- It's cool, huh?
- Yeah. Thanks, dad.

39:19.056 --> 39:20.990
We'll start with backgammon tomorrow.

39:21.058 --> 39:22.184
Okay.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.257
Thanks for your help
on the poker game.

39:26.330 --> 39:29.094
- You're welcome.
- Your father would be proud.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.395
I'll take your word for that.

39:30.468 --> 39:31.833
This is what Dutch and I
were working on,

39:31.903 --> 39:33.530
a whole new vision for the city.

39:33.604 --> 39:36.232
Those glass buildings?
Transparent solar panels.

39:36.307 --> 39:39.208
I'm glad you're now a part of it.

39:39.277 --> 39:40.608
Me, too.

39:40.678 --> 39:43.613
Well, you didn't come down here just to
see my dream for Manhattan.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.047
I'd like to see that report, yes.

39:46.150 --> 39:47.515
No problem.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.754
Hello, Mr. George.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.567
You had the dealer?

40:03.634 --> 40:05.534
There are two reports.

40:06.671 --> 40:08.036
The correct ntsb report

40:08.105 --> 40:09.970
which states your dad's crash
was indeed caused

40:10.041 --> 40:13.067
by foul play,
and the maintenance report

40:13.144 --> 40:15.704
that says only one mechanic
worked on the plane.

40:15.780 --> 40:19.216
It appears a man named Norman Exley
was responsible.

40:19.283 --> 40:21.046
You've heard of him?

40:21.819 --> 40:22.945
Yeah.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.881
And I guess he lied to me.

40:28.392 --> 40:29.916
Go to the police, Nick.

40:29.994 --> 40:33.157
There's plenty of evidence for them
to look into.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.929
- Thank you, Simon.
- No problem. Thank you.

40:37.668 --> 40:39.898
We'll definitely be in touch.

40:47.578 --> 40:49.944
Your next appointment is here.

40:50.047 --> 40:51.412
Send him in.

40:56.220 --> 41:00.054
- Simon, glad we can finally do this.
- It's been a long time coming.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.819
- I'll say.
- Please.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.824
Thank you. See you tomorrow. Bye.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.391
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Where are they going?

41:11.469 --> 41:12.595
Those were samples, dear.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.433
We're not keeping them
for three months.

41:14.505 --> 41:15.995
Mommy. Mommy.

41:17.275 --> 41:19.800
Freddy and I
are moving the wedding up.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.367
- Really?
- Yeah. Well, why wait?

41:21.445 --> 41:23.913
The time, she is a-ripe.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.910
All right. Come on, baby.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.853
Are you sure about this
after everything that's happened?

41:31.923 --> 41:33.754
Yeah. Yeah, you were right.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.951
I don't want three people
in my marriage.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.154
I want to move forward now.

41:41.566 --> 41:42.931
I have to.

41:56.113 --> 41:57.978
You can't deny
this is pretty strong evidence.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.073
It is.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.674
It proves Exley tampered
with the plane.

42:00.751 --> 42:02.309
He killed my father.

42:02.420 --> 42:03.887
You're right.

42:03.955 --> 42:06.719
I'm just sorry we can't arrest him
and ask him why.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.053
Why not?

42:11.228 --> 42:14.891
Norman Exley was found dead
in his apartment this morning.

42:17.335 --> 42:22.238
In the air the questions hang

42:22.440 --> 42:27.207
will we get to do something

42:27.511 --> 42:32.448
who we gonna end up being

42:32.650 --> 42:37.314
how we gonna end up feeling

42:37.421 --> 42:46.564
what you gonna spend
your free life on?
