00:25.458 --> 00:28.625
I know what you're thinkin'. How did
a guy like me land a girl like her?

00:28.708 --> 00:31.083
-We get this all the time.
-We've been friends forever.

00:31.166 --> 00:32.791
<i>I've always had a crush on her.</i>

00:32.875 --> 00:35.041
But society has deemed it
socially unacceptable

00:35.125 --> 00:37.416
-for a tall girl to date a short guy.

00:37.500 --> 00:41.208
Tell me about it. I mean,
I was constantly bullied for being tall.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.375
-How's the weather up there?
<i>-Especially by my tormentor, Kimmy.</i>

00:44.458 --> 00:46.875
-Nice sweatpants, Sasquatch.

00:46.958 --> 00:48.041
<i>It felt like a curse.</i>

00:48.125 --> 00:51.291
<i>Then this Swedish exchange student</i>
<i>named Stig showed up--</i>

00:51.375 --> 00:54.250
-<i>And stayed with my family.</i>
-<i>He was even taller than me.</i>

00:54.333 --> 00:56.916
They dated for a bit,
but he totally played her.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.708
<i>Yeah, he did, and he humiliated me</i>
<i>in front of our entire class.</i>

01:00.791 --> 01:02.708
She's, uh, secretly in love with me.

01:02.791 --> 01:03.750
What?

01:03.833 --> 01:05.833
Don't worry, I stepped in.
I stood up for her…

01:05.916 --> 01:08.500
She is so much cooler
than all you guys combined.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.666
Took a punch to the face.
It was no big deal.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.833
-It was a big deal.
-It was a big deal.

01:12.916 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, I mean…

01:14.083 --> 01:17.041
He was the one who gave me
the confidence to stand up for myself

01:17.125 --> 01:20.333
<i>with the sweetest gift. </i>

01:20.416 --> 01:22.500
<i>After that, I owned my height.</i>

01:22.583 --> 01:24.958
<i>And homecoming was a big step for me.</i>

01:25.041 --> 01:26.958
Uh, hi. I-- I'm Jodi.

01:27.041 --> 01:30.750
You may know me as "Amazon"
or "Jodi the Green Giant."

01:30.833 --> 01:34.750
Being tall actually is what makes me me,
and I-- I like me.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.125
<i>My best friend Fareeda</i>

01:36.208 --> 01:38.500
<i>and my sister Harper were there,</i>
<i>cheering me on.</i>

01:38.583 --> 01:40.458
And that's when she realized…

01:40.541 --> 01:43.750
That he was the one
I was supposed to be with all along.

01:43.833 --> 01:45.208
Mm-hm, which makes sense,

01:45.291 --> 01:48.125
considering I carried around
a milk crate for my entire life,

01:48.208 --> 01:49.583
waiting for my chance to kiss her.

01:49.666 --> 01:52.416
<i>Which finally happened</i>
<i>about three months ago.</i>

01:53.000 --> 01:55.041
<i>And it's been bliss ever since.</i>

01:57.083 --> 01:58.083
Would the lady care--

01:58.166 --> 01:59.833
My back!

01:59.916 --> 02:01.833
Unfortunately, the milk crate's
no longer with us.

02:01.916 --> 02:05.541
Which is why I am buying him a backpack
for our three-month anniversary.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.375
Are you sure you don't mind
leaning down to kiss me?

02:08.458 --> 02:09.833
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:14.166 --> 02:15.333
Aah.

02:15.416 --> 02:19.041
-Sorry, we were just babbling.
-Yeah, what was the question again?

02:19.125 --> 02:21.166
What brings you in today?

02:21.791 --> 02:23.916
-Well, the backpack.
-Yeah, this one.

02:25.583 --> 02:27.000
You like this one, right?

02:27.083 --> 02:28.000
-Yeah.
-Okay.

02:42.791 --> 02:44.125
-Hey.
-I got you a smoothie.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.875
-Oh, thank you.
-Of course.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.416
-Jodi!
-Mikey!

02:47.500 --> 02:49.041
-What's up?
-What up, girl?

02:49.125 --> 02:50.583
-Hey--
-Oh, here.

02:50.666 --> 02:52.583
I got you. There you go.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.000
Suzie!

02:55.083 --> 02:57.416
I need to know where you got that top now.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.333
Fareeda Marks. Remember the name.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.208
-Thought she was talking about mine.
-It's cute.

03:02.291 --> 03:03.958
Can I buy you a cup of coffee some time?

03:04.041 --> 03:06.291
Hey. Boyfriend. Right here.

03:06.375 --> 03:08.416
Didn't know. Just moved here.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.416
Keep moving.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.333
But I've never given a speech
in class before.

03:17.416 --> 03:21.208
Just go out there and do your best,
and if you mess up, just know it's okay.

03:21.291 --> 03:22.916
Jodi! It's up!

03:36.041 --> 03:37.208
Big moment.

03:41.166 --> 03:42.375
Guys.

03:42.458 --> 03:45.375
I know you said
not to make a big deal out of this…

03:45.458 --> 03:48.041
-But we didn't listen!
-It's just an audition.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.583
That you've been wanting to do
since middle school.

03:50.666 --> 03:52.625
This is a moment to commemorate.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.250
Hey!

03:54.333 --> 03:56.166
This is not.

03:56.250 --> 03:58.125
-Hey.
-Wow. What are we celebrating?

03:58.208 --> 04:01.541
We aren't celebrating anything,
because we are no longer friends.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.625
-Keep walking, IKEA.
-Oh!

04:03.708 --> 04:07.000
We're, uh-- We're celebrating
my name on that audition list.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.083
<i>Bye Bye Birdie?</i> Wow.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.166
That's my second favorite musical!
After <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

04:12.791 --> 04:14.416
Dunk, wanna know my third favorite?

04:14.500 --> 04:15.875
Oh my God!

04:15.958 --> 04:17.041
I don't care.

04:17.750 --> 04:18.583
Okay.

04:23.916 --> 04:24.750
Okay.

04:25.750 --> 04:26.958
See you guys later.

04:27.041 --> 04:28.291
Knuckle touch?

04:28.958 --> 04:29.833
Handshake?

04:29.916 --> 04:31.375
See you at home.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.041
I can't believe he's trying
to be friends with us

04:36.125 --> 04:38.916
after torturing you
with his sick, twisted mind games.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.750
I cannot believe
that you forgave him after everything.

04:41.833 --> 04:45.791
He's apologized to us multiple times.
Can you just give him a break?

04:45.875 --> 04:47.875
-No.
-No. He's the worst.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.083
-To Jodi.
-To Jodi.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.708
-To me.

04:55.958 --> 04:58.208
-Mmm. Apple cider, a classic.

05:30.541 --> 05:31.625
Hi.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.583
Hello.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.208
I'm Tommy.

05:35.958 --> 05:37.083
I know.

05:38.041 --> 05:40.000
I saw you in <i>Hairspray</i> last year.

05:40.083 --> 05:42.333
-You were amazing.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.458
-Thank you.
-It was really good.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.791
I'm Jodi, by the way.

05:48.291 --> 05:49.291
I know.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.250
I'm a fan of your work too.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.000
-My work?
-Yeah.

05:56.625 --> 06:00.291
"So go ahead and…
and keep calling me names."

06:00.375 --> 06:03.541
"Keep making fun of me. Keep asking me,

06:03.625 --> 06:08.041
'How's the weather up there?'
Because the weather up here is great."

06:08.125 --> 06:11.083
-Mm-hm. Yeah.
-It's from your homecoming speech.

06:11.708 --> 06:12.875
You remember it.

06:12.958 --> 06:15.000
I do. Yeah, every word.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.958
How?

06:17.041 --> 06:20.250
Let's just say
you are extremely memorable.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.125
-Hey, man. Watch it.
-Oh, sorry. Sorry.

06:27.916 --> 06:29.250
-Phew.
-Jeez.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.541
-You okay?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.750
Yeah. Just a little on edge.

06:34.916 --> 06:38.083
I've heard you sing.
You have nothing to be nervous about.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.291
You'll do great.

06:40.125 --> 06:40.958
Thanks.

06:43.583 --> 06:44.833
What are you doing here?

06:45.666 --> 06:47.458
Auditioning. Same as you.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.750
Madeline has already cast me
in lead roles multiple times,

06:50.833 --> 06:53.708
so this is really more of a formality
than an audition.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.791
-Jodi Kreyman.
-Yeah.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.166
-You're up.
-Okay.

06:57.666 --> 06:59.875
-You're gonna do great.
-Thanks.

06:59.958 --> 07:01.041
Try to relax…

07:03.916 --> 07:06.250
'cause you don't stand a chance.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.500
Miss me, Stiggy baby?

07:16.041 --> 07:17.416
Kimmy.

07:37.041 --> 07:40.208
So you've never performed on stage before?

07:41.125 --> 07:41.958
Never.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.083
What about that speech
you gave at the homecoming dance?

07:45.166 --> 07:48.208
Oh, uh… Well, I wouldn't
call that a performance.

07:48.291 --> 07:51.583
But you were on stage,
in front of a huge crowd,

07:52.083 --> 07:54.416
delivering what was essentially
an improvised monologue.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.375
Isn't that performing?

07:56.541 --> 07:57.791
I guess it is.

07:57.875 --> 08:02.041
What would you say to people who don't
think that being tall is a real problem?

08:03.375 --> 08:04.375
Excuse me?

08:04.958 --> 08:07.875
Getting a terminal illness,
being homeless,

08:07.958 --> 08:10.500
not knowing where your next meal
is coming from…

08:10.583 --> 08:12.125
Those are real problems.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.958
But you seem
to have so much going for you.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.750
What do you have to complain about?

08:17.833 --> 08:20.708
Well, I'm not saying being tall
is worse than those things.

08:20.791 --> 08:24.041
It's just sometimes it feels like it is,
but I know that it's not.

08:25.041 --> 08:26.083
It just…

08:27.541 --> 08:29.041
doesn't make all the bad things

08:29.125 --> 08:32.458
that have happened to me
every day of my entire life any less real.

08:32.958 --> 08:35.125
Performing has always been my dream,

08:35.208 --> 08:38.458
but I didn't think I could do it,
until now.

08:38.541 --> 08:39.625
Okay.

08:42.083 --> 08:43.666
Thank you for coming in.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.416
-Wait a second, Harper.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.250
-You were offered a job?
-Mm-hm.

08:52.333 --> 08:53.583
Like a real job?

08:53.666 --> 08:54.750
Like with money?

08:54.833 --> 08:57.958
-Yes. With benefits and a parking space…
-Whoo!

08:58.041 --> 09:00.208
…and $401,000.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.958
-Oh!

09:02.500 --> 09:05.458
No, I think you mean a 401.

09:05.541 --> 09:07.833
-Mmm… Agree to disagree.
-That's usually--

09:07.916 --> 09:09.708
Wait. What is this job?

09:09.791 --> 09:12.708
Say hello to the co-host

09:12.791 --> 09:15.125
of the newest
behind-the-scenes entertainment show

09:15.208 --> 09:17.083
on the Pageant Network.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.375
There's a Pageant Network? What channel?

09:19.458 --> 09:21.083
How dare you? Come on.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.166
Congrats.

09:22.250 --> 09:24.541
Thank you.
Oh, by the way, the job is in LA.

09:25.833 --> 09:26.791
Louisiana?

09:27.541 --> 09:29.958
-You're moving to California?
-Los Angeles?

09:30.041 --> 09:32.583
Sorry, just wanted
to rip the Band-Aid off.

09:32.666 --> 09:35.208
Every time she speaks,
it's like I'm getting punched in the face.

09:35.916 --> 09:38.250
-Let's have another baby.
-I'm very fertile.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.708
-Ew.
-Eww!

09:39.791 --> 09:42.791
Okay, this is my chance to prove to myself

09:42.875 --> 09:46.625
and everyone else that I have more
to offer this world than just--

09:48.166 --> 09:49.000
Yeah.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.833
That I'm more than just shiny hair

09:50.916 --> 09:53.375
-and perfectly exfoliated skin.

09:53.458 --> 09:56.041
-I'm someone to be taken seriously.
-Yes, you are.

09:56.125 --> 09:59.666
-Which is why--
-Oh my God, I got the lead! Oh!

09:59.750 --> 10:00.625
What?

10:01.625 --> 10:05.916
-Sorry. I did not mean to cut you off.
-Uh, no, no, I was done. What lead?

10:07.208 --> 10:08.333
The spring musical.

10:08.916 --> 10:13.083
The director just texted me,
and I'm playing Kim in <i>Bye Bye Birdie.</i>

10:13.166 --> 10:14.708
-What?
-What?

10:14.791 --> 10:17.333
Look at my girls!
Both headed for greatness.

10:17.416 --> 10:18.583
-Oh!
-Aah!

10:18.666 --> 10:20.000
I gotta-- I gotta text Dunk.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.166
-Oh yeah.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.166
Dad, you-- you text my boyfriend?

10:23.250 --> 10:26.000
-Oh yeah.
-Well, seven, eight times a day, max.

10:27.083 --> 10:28.208
-That's weird.
-Strange.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.833
Oh! We're gonna throw you
a huge party for opening night.

10:30.916 --> 10:32.166
No, please. No party.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.791
-Yes. You are getting a party!
-Yes.

10:34.875 --> 10:37.083
-Party! Party! Party!
-No. No…

10:37.166 --> 10:39.250
Party! Party!

10:39.333 --> 10:41.708
-No.
-How do you feel about floats?

10:41.791 --> 10:43.541
-No.
-Theme - birds.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.291
-You said 12, right?
-Thank you.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.458
There you go.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.500
-And, uh…
-Thanks.

10:53.041 --> 10:55.708
And whatever this fine couple wants.
It's on me.

10:55.791 --> 10:57.333
Toppings are included.

10:57.416 --> 11:00.083
-That's so sweet.
-No problem. We're having a big night.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.250
-We're celebrating, so…
-Yeah.

11:02.333 --> 11:05.041
-So, treating yourself to two scoops?
-You know my motto.

11:05.125 --> 11:06.375
-Taller is always better.
-Ah.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.833
Speaking of taller,
what's she, like, six-two, six-three?

11:10.500 --> 11:11.458
-Rude.
-No.

11:11.541 --> 11:13.583
No, no, no, rude.
You know what? Excuse me.

11:13.666 --> 11:17.375
-Hold on. No more toppings for you.
-No, no, no, it's cool. Thank you.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.833
Enjoy your toppings, guys. Okay.

11:23.458 --> 11:24.958
It's okay.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.916
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.708
Three months ago,
that really would have bothered you.

11:29.791 --> 11:30.666
Probably.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.541
And, uh, also three months ago,

11:33.625 --> 11:35.625
you could barely speak
in front of a crowd.

11:35.708 --> 11:39.125
But now you're going to be performing
in front of the whole school.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.250
Yeah.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.416
I mean, as the star of the show.

11:43.083 --> 11:45.541
A night that will change your whole life.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.625
Yeah. Yeah…

11:52.708 --> 11:53.625
Um…

11:54.125 --> 11:58.666
But thank you for believing I could do it,
even when I didn't.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.208
You're gonna crush it.

12:00.791 --> 12:01.708
Thanks.

12:02.791 --> 12:03.625
Cheers.

12:04.333 --> 12:05.166
Cheers.

12:15.291 --> 12:17.541
<i>You don't deserve this part.</i>

12:17.625 --> 12:19.000
<i>You got lucky.</i>

12:22.166 --> 12:25.208
-<i>You finally got your dream.</i>

12:26.750 --> 12:28.791
<i>You think you can actually pull this off?</i>

12:34.000 --> 12:38.208
So this voice just pops into your head
last night while brushing your teeth,

12:38.291 --> 12:39.833
and now it won't go away?

12:39.916 --> 12:40.750
Yeah.

12:41.791 --> 12:43.041
Have you heard it before?

12:43.625 --> 12:47.250
Well, I mean, there's always been <i>a</i> voice,
but nothing like this.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.875
I mean, this one, it's just--

12:48.958 --> 12:53.708
Louder? Crueler? Makes you believe your
worst fears and insecurities are true?

12:53.791 --> 12:54.625
Yes!

13:00.000 --> 13:00.833
What?

13:00.916 --> 13:02.083
Mm-hm.

13:03.875 --> 13:07.833
I was… afraid this might happen.

13:08.708 --> 13:12.083
I prayed it wouldn't,
but if only I'd prayed harder.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.791
What are you talking about?

13:13.875 --> 13:14.958
That voice!

13:16.041 --> 13:17.708
That negative voice in your head,

13:17.791 --> 13:19.750
the one that tells you
that you're a fraud,

13:20.333 --> 13:22.708
and all the wonderful things
happening in your life

13:22.791 --> 13:26.083
aren't because you're talented or smart.

13:26.166 --> 13:28.000
It's just because you're lucky.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.291
But why would it happen now?

13:30.375 --> 13:33.625
Because now you're out there,

13:34.208 --> 13:37.291
risking failure and humiliation,

13:37.375 --> 13:39.375
and the more out there you are,

13:39.875 --> 13:41.750
the louder that voice gets.

13:41.833 --> 13:44.500
So how do I make it stop?

13:44.583 --> 13:45.625
You can't.

13:46.791 --> 13:49.166
It's just a horrible part of life
that never goes away.

13:50.166 --> 13:51.291
Like Maroon 5.

13:51.791 --> 13:55.750
-Ugh, allergies.
-Wait, so you get it too?

13:55.833 --> 13:56.708
No!

13:56.791 --> 13:58.208
No! No.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.458
No, no, no, no, no.

13:59.541 --> 14:02.000
But I've been in 37 beauty pageants.

14:02.083 --> 14:06.416
And every single time, I'd see
that voice tear someone apart so badly,

14:06.500 --> 14:08.500
they couldn't even step foot on stage.

14:09.291 --> 14:11.416
So you're saying that that…
that could be me?

14:11.916 --> 14:16.333
I'm saying there's no worse bully
than the one you create in your own head.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.291
You have to control it.
Otherwise, it could eventually get worse

14:21.791 --> 14:23.208
and control you.

14:24.583 --> 14:25.791
Okay.

14:36.958 --> 14:40.250
You cast Jodi as the lead
and me as her understudy?

14:40.333 --> 14:42.083
Theater is about taking risks.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.333
I cast Jodi as the lead
because she possesses

14:44.416 --> 14:47.416
a rawness and authenticity
that the role desperately needs.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.625
So I'm just supposed
to sit back in rehearsals and watch?

14:50.708 --> 14:54.083
There are no small parts,
Kimmy, just small actors.

14:54.166 --> 14:55.625
Well, that's nice to know.

14:55.708 --> 14:59.166
'Cause one thing
Jodi definitely is not is a small actor!

15:01.083 --> 15:02.208
I'm sorry, Kimmy.

15:02.291 --> 15:05.000
Oh, this isn't over.
I'm just getting started.

15:05.083 --> 15:06.708
Oh, I'm afraid to ask.

15:06.791 --> 15:09.083
All we have to do
is humiliate Jodi so badly

15:09.166 --> 15:11.541
on the first day of rehearsal
that she drops out.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.875
For instance, I'm just pitching,
you slip NyQuil

15:13.958 --> 15:16.875
into one of the smoothies
Dunkleman makes her so she passes out.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.916
-Or did you see that movie <i>Carrie?</i>
-Mm-hm.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.708
She gets a bucket of pig guts
dropped on her from the rafters.

15:21.791 --> 15:23.041
"Bye Bye Jodi."

15:23.125 --> 15:24.958
I don't know where I would get pig guts.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.375
-Then Google it.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.916
-What?
-Doing your dirty work…

15:29.000 --> 15:33.083
It's just starting to make me feel
a little, well… well, dirty.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.166
-Where is this coming from?
-Ever since we lost Liz, I just…

15:36.250 --> 15:39.416
I-- I can't stop thinking
about how fragile life is.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.708
She didn't die! Her mom got a new job,
and they moved to Seattle.

15:42.791 --> 15:45.750
Okay, but still, it's like one day,
your best friend is right here,

15:45.833 --> 15:47.791
and then the next, they're gone.

15:47.875 --> 15:50.208
I don't know what to tell you, Schnip.
This is who I am.

15:50.791 --> 15:53.416
And if you can't have my back
when I need you the most, then…

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
maybe this friendship has run its course.

15:57.458 --> 15:58.541
Maybe it has.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.916
Wait, what?

16:01.500 --> 16:03.333
Maybe I need to find out
who I am on my own,

16:03.416 --> 16:05.083
instead of as your sidekick.

16:05.666 --> 16:06.791
That's all I've ever been.

16:19.666 --> 16:22.875
Be well. Try and remember the good times.

16:28.708 --> 16:31.666
You try and remember the good times!

16:38.333 --> 16:42.416
-What do you think of this color?
-So beautiful. I'm snapping it all.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.708
-I don't know if I'm feeling 'em.
-No?

16:44.791 --> 16:47.458
-I really think they look great on you.
-Hey, Fareeda.

16:49.458 --> 16:50.291
Is this me?

16:50.375 --> 16:53.166
I don't know, Stig. Who are you?

16:56.166 --> 17:00.375
I-- I'm sorry, I just can't believe
that you invited Stig out today with us.

17:00.458 --> 17:01.750
He didn't get a part in the show.

17:01.833 --> 17:05.375
He's been really down, and, I don't know,
he has no one to hang out with, so…

17:05.875 --> 17:08.458
Sounds like a him problem,
not a me problem.

17:08.541 --> 17:11.208
Okay, if I am able
to give him a second chance,

17:11.291 --> 17:13.375
you should be able
to give him a first one.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.500
Let's be honest, you never really did.

17:15.583 --> 17:18.333
-Right after I make this call.
-That shirt is sick.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.833
Oh, thank you.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.041
Where'd you get it?

17:22.791 --> 17:25.791
Actually, my best friend
Fareeda designed it.

17:26.291 --> 17:29.000
-Hi.
-Yeah, and she's amazing.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.625
She knows the three Fs
like nobody's business.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.875
You know the three Fs?

17:33.958 --> 17:36.166
Form, fit, function. Come on.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.708
I replaced having a social life
with watching <i>Queer Eye. </i>Okay?

17:39.791 --> 17:41.791
Can you bring me a few of these?

17:41.875 --> 17:43.541
You mean, to sell?

17:43.625 --> 17:46.041
-Yeah.
-Oh, I have so many more.

17:46.125 --> 17:48.250
-Tons more.
-Even way cooler ones.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.500
Like way, way cooler.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.416
Then I guess
you'll have to bring those too.

17:52.916 --> 17:53.916
I will.

17:59.083 --> 17:59.916
So good!

18:00.000 --> 18:02.875
That was amazing. I'm so proud of you.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.916
I'm so proud of us.
Look at us, girl bosses bossin' it up.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.500
-It's amazing.
-We're livin' the dream.

18:10.666 --> 18:12.708
-Boom.
-Whoo! High five!

18:14.291 --> 18:16.416
Medium five? Or low?

18:16.500 --> 18:19.625
This is only
because you said that nice thing about me.

18:22.375 --> 18:25.041
So I got you some things
for your first day.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.458
Here you go. It's three water bottles.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.583
-You can put those anywhere.
-Thank you.

18:29.666 --> 18:30.625
Some throat coat tea,

18:30.708 --> 18:33.875
and a kettle to warm up the water
for the throat coat tea,

18:33.958 --> 18:36.166
'cause otherwise,
you're just drinkin' water.

18:36.250 --> 18:39.416
Some, uh… Some lozenges, which,
if you could take those right there.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.833
-Cool.
-Oh, but that's not all.

18:40.916 --> 18:42.583
And a snack. I know you like to snack.

18:42.666 --> 18:44.375
Last but not least,

18:44.458 --> 18:46.916
I got you a pitch pipe for singing.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I got myself one too,
because they're awesome.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.333
-Right.

18:51.416 --> 18:53.333
That's beautiful!

18:54.208 --> 18:56.916
-Thank you. This is perfect.
-Yeah?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.750
I just want you to have
a good first rehearsal, and I'll just…

18:59.833 --> 19:03.041
I'll be… hangin' out until you're done.

19:03.125 --> 19:06.541
You must have something better to do
than sit around and wait for me.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.375
Yeah! I do.

19:08.916 --> 19:10.500
I have to feed my fish.

19:11.166 --> 19:12.250
You don't have a fish.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.666
-I have to buy a fish. And then feed it.

19:15.750 --> 19:16.625
-Okay.
-For sure.

19:16.708 --> 19:18.833
Whew. Here I go.

19:20.791 --> 19:21.625
Good luck.

19:22.708 --> 19:23.583
Thank you.

19:29.541 --> 19:31.291
-Hi!
-Hi!

19:40.166 --> 19:41.916
Yeah, got it, got it.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.875
-Okay.
-<i>You're way out of your league.</i>

19:45.583 --> 19:47.041
<i>And they all know it.</i>

19:47.750 --> 19:49.416
<i>Kimmy should be the lead.</i>

19:49.500 --> 19:52.041
-Kimmy!
-<i>And you know it… know it…</i>

19:52.125 --> 19:53.791
Oh, shoot. Sorry. Sorry.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.666
Hello, Kim. We meet again.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.500
It's-- It's Jodi, actually.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.750
But you're playing Kim,
and I'm playing Conrad.

20:04.833 --> 20:07.166
-Yeah. Right.
-Let me help you with all this, please.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.125
-Thank you.
-Jeez.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.416
-Got a lot.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, you do.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.875
-Okay…
-Aah…

20:13.375 --> 20:14.708
Seen the rehearsal schedule?

20:14.791 --> 20:16.708
-No, not yet.
-Oh, it's nuts.

20:16.791 --> 20:20.000
We're basically spending every second
together for the next month, so…

20:20.083 --> 20:23.250
Yeah. You're gonna get sick
of seeing my face, I'm sorry.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.666
No, you're gonna get sick
of seeing my face.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.000
That's impossible.

20:27.083 --> 20:30.541
No, seriously, you're just gonna look
at me one day and be like…

20:33.000 --> 20:36.083
I'm really nervous. Sorry, I don't know
if you can tell. I just--

20:36.166 --> 20:37.666
-It's fine.
-Right. Okay.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.916
It's just tall people aren't really known
for their coordination.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.750
You got this.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.250
<i>Goodbye.</i>

21:01.666 --> 21:02.875
-Oof!
-Oh my God.

21:02.958 --> 21:04.000
-Oh!

21:09.583 --> 21:12.416
Jodi, you have the first line.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.583
Oh, I must have missed that. Sorry.

21:14.666 --> 21:17.208
-Yeah, along with the rest of your lines.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.583
Let's try that again.

21:25.541 --> 21:27.708
-Sorry. Shoot! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-Oh!

21:27.791 --> 21:29.625
-You're making it worse!

21:29.708 --> 21:31.375
-Christian!
-It's fine. See?

21:38.750 --> 21:39.583
Sorry.

21:43.458 --> 21:45.333
First week of rehearsals is the hardest.

21:45.416 --> 21:48.333
Especially with you
trying to psych me out from the sidelines.

21:48.416 --> 21:50.833
-There's no shame in quitting.
-Why would I quit?

21:50.916 --> 21:52.833
Because when the time comes

21:52.916 --> 21:55.708
for you to be standing on stage
in front of a packed audience,

21:55.791 --> 22:00.500
blinded by the lights,
sweat pouring down your face,

22:00.583 --> 22:02.125
you know deep down you'll choke.

22:02.208 --> 22:05.333
Hey, she won't choke.
She's gonna be amazing.

22:06.041 --> 22:08.416
Whatever. You two deserve each other.

22:11.958 --> 22:16.416
Hey, look, I don't know why
you just stuck up for me but… thank you.

22:17.041 --> 22:18.291
Yeah, my pleasure.

22:18.375 --> 22:20.000
Yeah, so, um,

22:20.500 --> 22:23.250
do you ever think about
that time we kissed?

22:23.333 --> 22:24.708
No.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.208
Right. Me too.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.041
Every day.

22:32.291 --> 22:33.166
I'm just…

22:37.291 --> 22:38.750
-Oh!

22:38.833 --> 22:40.958
-Oh no. Oh!

22:41.791 --> 22:43.250
Aah! Asparagus!

22:44.166 --> 22:46.958
Okay, come on. Come on. Oh boy.

22:48.458 --> 22:49.666
Please.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.333
Oh no!

22:53.125 --> 22:55.291
Oh, come on. Come on, come on!

22:55.375 --> 22:58.291
Ah, no! You burned the chicken
stuffed in the duck stuffed in the turkey?

22:58.375 --> 23:01.000
It's a turducken, Dad. Yeah, I ruined it.

23:01.083 --> 23:04.083
I told you to go with roasted chicken.
You flew too close to the sun.

23:04.166 --> 23:06.958
-I didn't want to play safe. I don't know.
-What is burning in here?

23:07.041 --> 23:09.833
The dinner I'm making for Jodi,
who'll be here in an hour.

23:09.916 --> 23:12.458
-Ooh, what's the occasion?
-Three-month anniversary.

23:12.541 --> 23:16.541
That's so massive at your age,
and now the night is a tur-dumpster fire.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.000
-How is that helpful?
-Sorry.

23:18.083 --> 23:18.958
At all?

23:19.041 --> 23:20.375
-Hmm? Hmm?
-Hmm?

23:20.458 --> 23:22.166
-What's going on--
-Hmm…

23:22.250 --> 23:24.500
-Mm-hm.
-I got you, Dunkers Seniors.

23:24.583 --> 23:27.250
You two boys work it out.
Don't get me in trouble with Mom.

23:28.916 --> 23:30.416
Hey. Hey, man. What are you doing?

23:30.500 --> 23:33.583
We've less than an hour to cook.
Not much, Dunkers.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.708
-Give me a hand and chop these onions.
-Oh.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.458
Onions? Are you trying to sabotage me?

23:38.541 --> 23:41.708
I need them in the pan ASAP
if they're to caramelize. Chop-chop.

23:41.791 --> 23:44.291
I haven't talked to you in months.
Now you'll help me?

23:44.375 --> 23:47.541
Do you want to impress your girlfriend,
or sit here and chitchat? Hmm?

23:47.625 --> 23:49.125
Yes, chef. Sorry, chef.

23:57.125 --> 24:00.833
For your first course,
Dunkers here has prepared bruschetta

24:00.916 --> 24:03.750
topped with roasted tomatoes,
caramelized onions,

24:03.833 --> 24:08.041
and if I may be so bold,
it pairs very nicely with the iced teas.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.083
I hope you enjoy.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.916
-I'm going to go check on the pasta. Ciao.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.208
What was that?

24:15.291 --> 24:17.666
He offered to wait on us.
I wasn't gonna turn him down.

24:17.750 --> 24:20.666
Just make sure you--
you leave him a nice tip.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.500
-I thought you were paying.
-Am I now?

24:22.583 --> 24:25.833
-Dad? Dad, what are you doing?
-You're just killing it right now.

24:25.916 --> 24:26.916
Okay, bounce now.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.875
-There you go. Thank you, Dad.

24:28.958 --> 24:30.791
-Okay.
-I don't know!

24:31.583 --> 24:33.333
Before we eat, I'd like to make a toast.

24:33.416 --> 24:34.666
Okay.

24:35.625 --> 24:38.708
I just want to say how happy I am

24:38.791 --> 24:41.000
to be sitting here with you tonight.

24:41.083 --> 24:43.666
And to watch you face your fears

24:43.750 --> 24:45.291
and chase this big dream

24:45.375 --> 24:47.375
of performing in front of people

24:47.875 --> 24:50.958
is truly inspiring.

24:51.750 --> 24:54.291
<i>A dream that you know</i>
<i>will never happen.</i>

24:54.375 --> 24:55.958
-<i>…never happen…</i>
-Dunkers…

24:56.041 --> 24:59.791
<i>Once you bomb, he'll say,</i>
<i>"Bye Bye Jodi…</i> <i>Bye Bye Jodi…"</i>

24:59.875 --> 25:01.250
<i>So enjoy tonight,</i>

25:01.333 --> 25:04.041
<i>because there won't be</i>
<i>a four-month anniversary.</i>

25:04.125 --> 25:05.500
<i>-Anniversary…</i>
Jodi?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.291
Jodi!

25:08.000 --> 25:09.083
Yeah! Yeah.

25:09.166 --> 25:11.833
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
It looked like you were spacing out.

25:11.916 --> 25:13.416
-I'm sorry. My--
-It's okay.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.541
My mind is just… elsewhere.

25:16.625 --> 25:18.416
I'm under so much pressure for the show,

25:18.500 --> 25:20.291
but I've been looking forward
to this night.

25:20.375 --> 25:22.541
No, don't worry about it. I get it.

25:23.041 --> 25:28.375
Look, if you need this time
to rehearse or memorize your lines…

25:28.458 --> 25:29.875
I don't know your process--

25:29.958 --> 25:32.208
-No, no, I'm not--
-But whatever you need to do.

25:32.291 --> 25:35.416
I'm not leaving in the middle
of our anniversary dinner, okay?

25:35.500 --> 25:40.375
Well, if you felt like you needed to,
I would understand.

25:40.958 --> 25:43.000
How did I get so lucky?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.416
Pretty amazing.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.125
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.375
-Right.
-Okay.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.833
What? Huh?

25:53.916 --> 25:55.333
What? Wait… Wh…

25:56.750 --> 25:58.208
Are you actually leaving?

25:59.791 --> 26:02.083
Well, you just--
You just said you didn't mind.

26:02.166 --> 26:04.000
Yeah. Okay.

26:04.083 --> 26:05.875
-So you do mind?
-A little.

26:05.958 --> 26:07.750
Then you just… You shouldn't have said it.

26:07.833 --> 26:10.083
I didn't think you would actually do it.

26:10.166 --> 26:11.916
Pasta primavera!

26:12.708 --> 26:13.791
Fine. I'll stay.

26:13.875 --> 26:16.666
-Don't do me any favors.
-What is that supposed to mean?

26:16.750 --> 26:19.250
Uh, parmigiano. No?

26:20.250 --> 26:21.125
No.

26:21.791 --> 26:22.708
-Okay.

26:22.791 --> 26:25.791
Jodi, you're like
Miss Popular now at school.

26:25.875 --> 26:30.541
Every time we walk down the hallway,
it's always, "Jodi!" "Mikey!"

26:30.625 --> 26:33.458
"Hey, can I buy you coffee sometime?"
I mean,

26:33.541 --> 26:37.458
why would the star of the spring musical
have time for little old Dunks anymore?

26:37.541 --> 26:39.958
-Am I a burden to you?

26:40.041 --> 26:41.375
-That's what it feels like.
-No.

26:42.708 --> 26:45.208
I just didn't know that's how you feel.

26:45.291 --> 26:48.500
Do you know how many candles
I lit for this? This was a big deal.

26:49.958 --> 26:52.250
I've actually lost my appetite, so…

26:55.333 --> 26:56.333
I'm gonna go.

26:57.958 --> 26:58.875
Come on.

26:58.958 --> 27:02.458
-Want me to wrap something up for you?
-No, I'm okay. Thanks, Stig.

27:09.916 --> 27:14.208
Let me just grab one with a flash.
And there's my handsome boy.

27:15.833 --> 27:18.458
You should go over there right now
and talk it out.

27:18.541 --> 27:21.083
But he is the one
who said it was okay that I left.

27:21.166 --> 27:23.083
No, Jodi, he was being nice.

27:23.166 --> 27:26.583
You are the ones who are
always telling me to stand up for myself.

27:26.666 --> 27:28.500
Why should I be the first to crack?

27:28.583 --> 27:31.083
There is no shame in cracking first.

27:31.833 --> 27:33.625
-Actually, there is.
-Yeah.

27:33.708 --> 27:35.083
Were you guys eavesdropping?

27:35.166 --> 27:38.958
If you crack first, Dunkleman is gonna
hold all the cards in the relationship.

27:39.041 --> 27:43.208
Now, I know you kids think that love is
about communication and give-and-take.

27:43.291 --> 27:44.666
-Well, it's not.
-No.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.375
Relationships are about power.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.666
-Who has it, and who doesn't.
-That's right.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.750
So I say, let Dunkleman sweat it out,
and you focus on your show.

27:52.833 --> 27:55.958
Oh, which reminds me,
we need 27 tickets for opening night.

27:56.041 --> 27:58.458
-No, wait, 28. Dr. Seeger.
-Oh. Right.

27:58.541 --> 28:00.166
You invited my pediatrician?

28:00.250 --> 28:03.958
Eh-- Look, I text Dunkleman,
and I invited your pediatrician.

28:04.041 --> 28:05.500
Please, let me live.

28:06.083 --> 28:08.375
Dr. Seeger probably saw me on the Tok.

28:08.458 --> 28:09.958
-Huh?
-The Tickety Tok.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.541
I was doin' all of that.
I was plugging your show, though.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.708
-You're on TikTok?
-You don't follow me?

28:14.791 --> 28:16.708
Jodi, focus!

28:16.791 --> 28:18.083
What's it gonna be?

28:24.083 --> 28:26.333
Don't worry, they're gonna sell.

28:26.416 --> 28:29.208
-I'm not worried.
-I mean, it's only been a week.

28:29.291 --> 28:31.166
Which is why I'm not worried.

28:31.666 --> 28:35.000
-And you shouldn't be either.
-I just-- I can't help it. I'm a worrier.

28:35.083 --> 28:36.625
Yes, we've met.

28:38.458 --> 28:40.083
Lookin' beautiful as ever, Kim.

28:40.833 --> 28:43.000
You're too kind, Conrad.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.416
Who was that?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.125
My costar.

28:49.208 --> 28:50.250
Conrad?

28:50.333 --> 28:52.875
No. Tommy. Conrad is his character name.

28:52.958 --> 28:54.791
Well, Tommy thinks you're beautiful.

28:54.875 --> 28:59.333
No. That was just his character
saying that to my character, Kim.

28:59.416 --> 29:04.083
Well, this is Fareeda telling Jodi
that Tommy thinks you're beautiful.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.541
Explain to me again
why you can't crack first?

29:07.625 --> 29:09.791
Because I've been chasing her
my entire life.

29:09.875 --> 29:12.291
If I just hold my ground,
I can win this fight.

29:12.375 --> 29:16.083
-Nobody wins in this kind of fight.
-This is America. There's always a winner.

29:16.166 --> 29:17.416
Pfft. And a loser.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.125
There's my guy!

29:21.666 --> 29:24.416
So, I know things got
a little heated the other day,

29:24.500 --> 29:26.291
and we said some things we didn't mean,

29:26.375 --> 29:28.666
and I think we should
just forget it even happened.

29:28.750 --> 29:32.333
And to sweeten the deal,
I promise to lay off Jodi the Green Giant.

29:32.416 --> 29:34.041
Do you know why I joined the crew?

29:34.625 --> 29:37.625
It's because I saw how upset you were
when you didn't get the lead.

29:38.208 --> 29:41.875
And I knew that having a friend
by your side during rehearsals

29:41.958 --> 29:43.291
would help you through it.

29:43.375 --> 29:46.458
Name one time you've been there
for someone who needed you.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.500
What, you want, like, specific dates?

29:54.291 --> 29:56.875
If we're gonna be friends,
I need to know you've changed,

29:56.958 --> 29:59.125
something you've made clear
you don't wanna do.

29:59.833 --> 30:02.750
But I believe that you have a good heart,

30:02.833 --> 30:05.666
so I hope you'll reconsider.

30:09.291 --> 30:10.125
Wait.

30:11.375 --> 30:13.208
You're making me eat lunch alone?

30:13.958 --> 30:15.333
On some level,

30:16.750 --> 30:18.416
we all eat lunch alone.

30:21.833 --> 30:24.541
-Oh, this is going to be so uncomfortable.
-Why?

30:24.625 --> 30:26.750
'Cause I don't do well with open tension.

30:26.833 --> 30:29.416
-Can you just be cool, please?
-All right.

30:29.500 --> 30:32.291
-Mr. Cool Guy reporting for duty.
-Oh, Stig.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.875
-Okay, come on. Somebody crack!

30:59.958 --> 31:01.500
Dude, I had it.

31:02.625 --> 31:04.208
I have nothing to say to him.

31:04.291 --> 31:06.541
-You've got nothing to say to me?
-No.

31:06.625 --> 31:11.250
Not even, say, an apology?
For bailing on our anniversary dinner?

31:11.333 --> 31:12.833
You said I could.

31:12.916 --> 31:15.666
You know, maybe instead of
attacking each other,

31:15.750 --> 31:18.708
you could try to articulate
what it is you want.

31:18.791 --> 31:20.833
-Fareeda, excellent point.
-Mmm.

31:20.916 --> 31:23.250
Let's unpack our wants.

31:23.333 --> 31:28.500
Okay, fine. What I want is a girlfriend
with a better work-life balance.

31:28.583 --> 31:29.958
I don't know what you want.

31:30.041 --> 31:32.291
A girlfriend with a better
work-life balance. I said!

31:32.375 --> 31:36.375
So if two people just aren't getting
what they want out of a relationship,

31:36.458 --> 31:38.208
what are they supposed to do?

31:38.333 --> 31:39.333
Typically, they break up.

31:40.458 --> 31:41.625
Stig.

31:41.708 --> 31:45.541
I-- I mean, not <i>they</i> should break up.
I just-- Oh my--

31:45.625 --> 31:48.875
-I don't know, man. Clearly, she wants to.
-Now he's projecting.

31:48.958 --> 31:52.500
I just think that you wanna break up,
and you don't have the guts to say it.

31:52.583 --> 31:55.333
-You don't think I have the guts?
-I don't think you have!

31:55.416 --> 31:58.333
-I have the guts.
-Really? Then say it!

31:58.416 --> 32:00.833
You say it,
if you have the guts to say it.

32:00.916 --> 32:03.291
Fine. I want to break up!

32:03.375 --> 32:04.291
-Great.
-Great!

32:07.833 --> 32:09.083
Why did I do that?

32:09.166 --> 32:10.208
-I love citrus.

32:11.625 --> 32:12.708
Stig.

32:12.791 --> 32:16.208
You would make a horrible therapist.

32:17.041 --> 32:18.458
Yeah, I was pretty bad.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.125
My dad's outside. He needs to see me.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.541
Is everything okay?

32:35.916 --> 32:37.375
Yeah, he's right here.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.250
-Is everything okay? What's wrong?
-Hold on.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.583
-I don't know.
-Why are you here?

32:41.666 --> 32:43.666
-Surprise!
-Oh my--

32:43.750 --> 32:45.625
-What?
-Aaaah!

32:45.708 --> 32:47.750
-Whoo!
-Aaah!

32:47.833 --> 32:49.458
What are you doing here?

32:49.541 --> 32:50.375
Visiting you,

32:50.458 --> 32:51.625
dummy!

32:51.708 --> 32:52.708
<i>-Ja!</i>
-Oh-ho!

32:55.125 --> 32:56.333
Who is this person?

32:56.416 --> 32:58.750
-Stig's sister.
-His sister?

32:58.833 --> 33:00.916
Oh no. You rented more Swedes?

33:01.000 --> 33:03.541
We thought he'd appreciate
having some family around,

33:03.625 --> 33:05.875
since you've been ignoring him
for three months.

33:05.958 --> 33:07.416
I didn't know he had a sister.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.291
That's because you don't talk to him.

33:09.375 --> 33:11.791
Everyone, this is Stella.

33:11.875 --> 33:14.875
Stella, this is Fareeda, and Jodi,

33:14.958 --> 33:16.708
and that is Dunkers.

33:17.625 --> 33:18.458
Dunkers?

33:18.541 --> 33:19.875
Hey. Hi.

33:19.958 --> 33:23.083
Oh, you're even more adorable
than your pictures.

33:23.666 --> 33:24.750
-I am?
-Yeah.

33:24.833 --> 33:25.666
He is?

33:26.583 --> 33:30.416
And I can't believe I'm meeting the girl
who broke my little brother's heart.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.708
-Well--
-He called me that night in tears.

33:32.791 --> 33:34.916
-It was allergies.
-"Who's going to love me?"

33:35.000 --> 33:36.291
I was a mess.

33:36.375 --> 33:39.000
Oh, I can't wait
for you to show me the city!Aah!

33:39.083 --> 33:41.291
I've got time now. Who's gonna come?

33:41.375 --> 33:42.583
I've got PE.

33:44.333 --> 33:45.708
-Calculus.
-Oof.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.041
-What about you, Dunkers?
-Uh… Hm? Me?

33:49.666 --> 33:50.583
Um…

34:03.333 --> 34:04.166
Dunkers is in.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.500
-Yes!
-Yeah!

34:05.583 --> 34:06.541
Whoo!

34:06.625 --> 34:09.125
-Slam dunk! Whoo!
-Let's do this.

34:09.791 --> 34:11.666
-Yes!
-Come on.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.958
Seat belts, gang. Seat belts.

34:15.041 --> 34:17.000
All right, Dad. Come on, back off.

34:17.083 --> 34:19.875
How was school today, bud?
Who'd you play with?

34:28.166 --> 34:31.000
<i>Looks like there's</i>
<i>a new tall girl in town.</i>

34:31.083 --> 34:33.916
<i>And she just drove off</i>
<i>with your boyfriend… boyfriend…</i>

34:34.000 --> 34:38.083
<i>Sorry, ex-boyfriend. Perfect timing.</i>

34:38.166 --> 34:40.208
-Jodi?
-Yeah?

34:40.750 --> 34:41.750
Are you okay?

34:47.208 --> 34:48.458
Dunk and I just…

34:49.750 --> 34:50.625
just broke up.

34:51.666 --> 34:54.083
Aw, Jodi.

35:01.125 --> 35:03.958
So, how's Ingvar?

35:04.041 --> 35:05.416
-Amazing.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.125
-Ew.
-He says hi.

35:07.208 --> 35:09.750
Wait, are you guys talking
about Ingvar Kruger?

35:09.833 --> 35:10.916
You know Ingvar?

35:11.666 --> 35:15.000
Stig said he's the best-looking,
coolest guy in your entire country.

35:15.791 --> 35:19.666
-Are you guys dating?
-Yes, and he completes my soul.

35:20.708 --> 35:22.666
Well, cherish each other.

35:22.750 --> 35:25.833
Because at any moment,
it could just all be over.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.333
He and Jodi broke up.

35:27.416 --> 35:28.875
-That can't be!

35:28.958 --> 35:31.333
You two are destined to be together.

35:32.208 --> 35:34.666
-Destined to be together?
-That's what Stig told me.

35:34.750 --> 35:35.833
What? When?

35:36.333 --> 35:38.458
The night he called to say
he blew it with Jodi.

35:38.541 --> 35:40.750
He said that what made
the whole thing even worse

35:40.833 --> 35:42.666
was he blew his chance
to be friends with you.

35:43.750 --> 35:47.875
-He doesn't have many of those back home.
-You never said anything.

35:49.541 --> 35:50.833
You never asked.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.041
I guess you're kind of right.

35:55.125 --> 35:59.666
I never asked about your friends
or your family or anything about you.

36:01.375 --> 36:04.500
I think I kind of blew my chance
of being friends with you too.

36:04.583 --> 36:06.166
You did, you jerk.

36:06.750 --> 36:09.500
-Course not, Dunkers! I love you!
-All right.

36:30.916 --> 36:32.333
What do you think you're doing?

36:33.416 --> 36:36.291
Just working through some Jodi feelings
I've kept locked inside.

36:36.375 --> 36:37.791
What Jodi feelings?

36:37.875 --> 36:39.375
Love and loss, bro.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.458
You didn't lose her, though. I did.

36:41.541 --> 36:42.708
I lost her a little bit.

36:42.791 --> 36:45.125
No, I'm saying you can't
lose someone a little bit.

36:45.208 --> 36:46.583
You lose them or you don't.

36:46.666 --> 36:50.000
Who'd have thought the love of our lives
would be the same person?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.833
-But you--
-This is crazy.

36:51.916 --> 36:55.833
You made out with her in an escape room
for, like, six seconds. That's not love.

36:55.916 --> 36:58.750
Then why is my heart
still trapped in that escape room?

36:59.375 --> 37:01.083
I'm not your therapist.

37:01.833 --> 37:04.500
Listen, now that
you and Jodi are broken up,

37:04.583 --> 37:06.458
think you could put in a good word for me?

37:09.166 --> 37:11.333
-You missed a spot.
-Hey, no.

37:11.416 --> 37:12.375
-Too late.
-No.

37:12.458 --> 37:16.166
<i>You definitely</i>
<i>failed that calculus test.</i>

37:16.250 --> 37:18.875
<i>Maybe college isn't</i>
<i>in the cards for you either.</i>

37:18.958 --> 37:20.958
-Jodi!
-Mikey…

37:35.583 --> 37:39.166
<i>It's getting real.</i>
<i>There's no turning back… turning back…</i>

37:39.250 --> 37:41.791
<i>-You're in too deep now… too deep now…</i>

37:41.875 --> 37:44.208
<i>If you're this nervous</i>
<i>looking at a poster,</i>

37:44.291 --> 37:46.166
<i>what are you gonna do on stage?</i>

37:46.250 --> 37:49.375
-Getting psyched for opening night?
-Yeah, so psyched.

37:52.625 --> 37:55.958
<i>But look at Kimmy.</i>
<i>So poised, so confident.</i>

37:56.041 --> 37:59.166
<i>For God's sake,</i>
<i>the name of the role is Kim!</i>

37:59.250 --> 38:01.416
<i>Just quit and let her have it.</i>

38:01.500 --> 38:02.916
Jodi, breathe.

38:04.625 --> 38:05.458
What?

38:07.041 --> 38:08.333
You're holding your breath.

38:09.333 --> 38:12.125
Oh. I was.

38:12.208 --> 38:13.333
Yeah.

38:13.416 --> 38:17.250
Do you ever find it nerve-racking
to watch your understudies rehearse?

38:18.708 --> 38:20.458
Not really. No.

38:21.125 --> 38:24.833
Of course not.
Because you don't get nervous.

38:24.916 --> 38:27.458
Now, why wouldn't you think
I get nervous, huh?

38:27.958 --> 38:29.166
I mean, look at you.

38:29.958 --> 38:34.583
Wow. Okay, so you've been judged
your whole life based on your appearance,

38:34.666 --> 38:36.666
and now you're doing the same thing to me?

38:37.666 --> 38:40.541
Yeah, I did just do the same thing.

38:40.625 --> 38:42.458
-It's okay.
-Sorry.

38:42.541 --> 38:47.083
One of the reasons why I can remember
every word of your homecoming speech

38:47.166 --> 38:49.250
is because of how much I related to it.

38:50.541 --> 38:51.916
In what way?

38:52.416 --> 38:53.291
I'll show you.

39:00.875 --> 39:03.958
-So this is where it happened.
-Where what happened?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.291
Ooh!

39:06.833 --> 39:07.708
Whew!

39:07.791 --> 39:09.458
That was impressive!

39:09.541 --> 39:10.750
Thank you.

39:10.833 --> 39:13.291
This is the place where I got my nickname

39:13.375 --> 39:15.791
that lasted all the way
throughout middle school.

39:16.291 --> 39:19.750
Tommy-potamus. Yeah.

39:19.833 --> 39:22.791
You… You were overweight?

39:22.875 --> 39:24.833
Oh, yeah. Way over.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.666
How far over?

39:27.750 --> 39:31.833
Far enough to where I'd be going down
that slide, and kids would just yell,

39:31.916 --> 39:33.625
"Tommy-potamus is on the slide!"

39:33.708 --> 39:35.333
-"Earthquake! Take cover!"
-Oh!

39:36.125 --> 39:37.208
-Creative.
-Isn't it?

39:37.291 --> 39:38.708
-Mm. Yeah.
-Yeah.

39:38.791 --> 39:41.833
I don't know, I just--
I started exercising and eating right

39:41.916 --> 39:44.041
and got the weight off eventually.

39:44.625 --> 39:46.541
But I still felt the same way inside.

39:46.625 --> 39:48.875
For me, it's movie theaters.

39:48.958 --> 39:52.208
I've had so much stuff thrown at my head

39:52.291 --> 39:53.916
because I'm blocking the screen.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.375
-I see.
-I can't totally relax in movie theaters.

39:58.458 --> 40:03.083
I think I'm just sitting there
waiting to get pelted by popcorn.

40:05.666 --> 40:07.833
Well, hey. If we ever do go to the movies,

40:07.916 --> 40:11.708
I am more than happy to sit
in the back row with you, so…

40:12.875 --> 40:15.708
Well, you will be miserable,
so I will buy the popcorn.

40:17.500 --> 40:21.291
I could never be miserable
hanging out with you.

40:27.791 --> 40:30.000
It's-- It's funny, um…

40:30.083 --> 40:35.125
I've… I've never thought of guys dealing
with the same weight issues that girls do.

40:35.208 --> 40:39.500
Yeah, those experiences
just get hardwired into our brains.

40:39.583 --> 40:41.833
Totally shapes who we are
and how we think.

40:42.458 --> 40:45.250
Do you think it's possible for us to…

40:46.541 --> 40:48.916
I don't know, rewire our brains

40:49.000 --> 40:51.791
so that we don't
get those negative thoughts?

40:53.541 --> 40:55.708
I don't know. Let's give it a shot.

40:58.208 --> 40:59.958
May I have this dance, Kim?

41:00.791 --> 41:02.791
What? You-- You want to rehearse here?

41:02.875 --> 41:09.291
Look, Jodi, this place has been
just one big, bad memory for me.

41:10.750 --> 41:13.041
Maybe you can help me
turn it into a good one.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.666
-All right.

41:18.750 --> 41:20.291
-Guess so.
-Yeah.

41:20.375 --> 41:21.791
-Okay.

42:37.291 --> 42:38.125
<i>What?</i>

42:38.208 --> 42:40.291
I knew Conrad liked you.

42:40.375 --> 42:41.666
Okay, Tommy.

42:41.750 --> 42:44.208
Whoever. I have so many questions.

42:44.291 --> 42:47.000
Question one.
Do you want it to happen again?

42:48.083 --> 42:49.083
I don't know.

42:49.708 --> 42:53.125
Question two. Does that mean
you want to get back together with Dunk?

42:54.041 --> 42:54.916
I don't know.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.208
I mean, maybe Dunk's
the one I'm supposed to be with.

42:59.708 --> 43:04.333
-Okay, why do I feel so guilty?
-Because you and Dunk just broke up.

43:04.416 --> 43:08.041
But make no mistake,
you are free to kiss whoever you want.

43:08.958 --> 43:11.208
-I know.
-But so is Dunk.

43:12.291 --> 43:16.625
I know. I just… I would like
to believe that if he did,

43:16.708 --> 43:21.041
he would have enough respect to tell me
so I wouldn't hear it from somebody else.

43:21.125 --> 43:23.375
-Then you know what to do.
-Yeah, I do.

43:23.458 --> 43:25.416
-<i>Boom.</i>
-<i>Oh, snap.</i>

43:26.250 --> 43:29.625
-<i>Here it is. Ready? Five, six.</i>

43:40.333 --> 43:41.666
<i>We're never gonna break up.</i>

43:41.750 --> 43:42.791
<i>Never.</i>

43:42.875 --> 43:44.333
-<i>We're perfect.</i>
-<i>Mwah!</i>

43:44.416 --> 43:45.791
Whatcha doin'?

43:45.875 --> 43:47.666
Hey! Don't you ever knock?

43:47.750 --> 43:50.333
You've been in here for over an hour.
I was worried.

43:50.416 --> 43:52.625
-I'm fine.
-You're not fine.

43:52.708 --> 43:55.000
You're watching videos
of you and Jodi again?

43:55.083 --> 43:56.916
Yeah, I can hear through the door.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.458
I'm deleting them, okay?

43:58.541 --> 44:00.333
How many have you deleted so far?

44:00.916 --> 44:04.875
None. But I was about to
before you barged in and interrupted me.

44:04.958 --> 44:05.833
Mm-hm.

44:05.916 --> 44:07.916
-Okay. Stella, come quick!
-Don't--

44:08.000 --> 44:10.916
-She won't want to miss this.
-Don't bring her into this.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
What's up?

44:12.083 --> 44:15.541
Dunkleman was just about to delete
all the videos of him and Jodi.

44:15.625 --> 44:16.458
Yeah.

44:16.541 --> 44:17.833
-Really?
-Yeah.

44:17.916 --> 44:18.750
-Bold.
-Yeah.

44:18.833 --> 44:21.625
But smart.
Erase any memory of the relationship.

44:22.166 --> 44:24.083
-Beignet?
-Always.

44:28.041 --> 44:31.375
Oh, everyone knows when you eat these,
you don't inhale.

44:31.458 --> 44:33.083
Look, I know you guys don't believe me.

44:33.166 --> 44:34.958
-But check this out.

44:35.041 --> 44:38.208
Eighty-seven videos checked, and…

44:40.041 --> 44:41.500
they're deleted. They're gone.

44:41.583 --> 44:42.583
What are you doing?

44:42.666 --> 44:46.458
The videos aren't truly deleted
until you click "Delete permanently."

44:46.541 --> 44:48.375
Yeah. Good save.

44:48.458 --> 44:51.541
We definitely want to make sure
that these cherished memories

44:51.625 --> 44:54.583
that meant so much to you
are gone forever,

44:55.208 --> 44:57.458
never to be seen or experienced again.

44:57.541 --> 44:58.541
Yeah.

44:58.625 --> 45:00.500
Like they never even happened, Dunk.

45:00.583 --> 45:04.750
Yeah. After I press this button,
they didn't. One--

45:04.833 --> 45:06.541
-If so, I should--
-And a half.

45:06.625 --> 45:07.458
-Two.
-Let me--

45:07.541 --> 45:08.708
-Two and a half.
-Three!

45:08.791 --> 45:10.541
Fine! Uh-- You win!

45:11.166 --> 45:12.458
I'm not okay!

45:13.291 --> 45:15.083
I'm lost without her.

45:15.791 --> 45:18.333
And I-- I want her back.
Is that what you want to hear?

45:18.416 --> 45:22.291
No, but I know someone else who might.

45:28.875 --> 45:32.458
The, uh, mangoes
are really fresh today, so…

45:32.541 --> 45:35.500
Oh, uh… peace offering?

45:37.416 --> 45:38.250
Tradition.

45:38.833 --> 45:41.916
So if we're, um,
keeping with the traditions,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.666
uh, are we still performing
"As Long as You Love Me"

45:44.750 --> 45:46.041
at Fareeda's birthday party?

45:46.125 --> 45:48.083
It's gonna be the highlight of the night.

45:48.166 --> 45:49.000
Cool.

45:49.750 --> 45:52.458
-I just can't even believe it.

45:52.541 --> 45:54.666
They discounted your shirts by 20%?

45:54.750 --> 45:56.250
Which is embarrassing enough.

45:56.333 --> 45:59.125
But to make it even worse,
I took my parents to the store,

45:59.208 --> 46:00.791
thinking they'd be impressed.

46:00.875 --> 46:03.416
And they saw with their own eyes
that their daughter,

46:03.500 --> 46:05.916
who'd been talking up
her big future as a designer,

46:06.000 --> 46:07.250
had been marked down.

46:07.333 --> 46:08.458
Oof.

46:08.541 --> 46:12.000
So, um, I-- I just want to say
how sorry I am for leaving our dinner.

46:12.500 --> 46:14.875
No, I'm sorry for overreacting.

46:16.041 --> 46:16.875
Yeah.

46:18.291 --> 46:19.333
Are we cool?

46:19.833 --> 46:21.583
Yeah, we're-- we're cool.

46:22.625 --> 46:25.291
I choked at my <i>Bye Bye Birdie</i> audition.

46:25.375 --> 46:26.791
That was one time.

46:26.875 --> 46:28.625
It happens every time.

46:28.708 --> 46:31.666
-Honestly, I've never even been in a show.
-What?

46:31.750 --> 46:35.333
When I met Jodi,
I acted like I had been in <i>Cats,</i>

46:35.416 --> 46:36.958
'cause I wanted to impress her.

46:37.041 --> 46:38.375
-Duh.

46:38.458 --> 46:41.208
If I'm goofing around at the piano,
yeah, I can hold a tune.

46:41.291 --> 46:44.291
But the second I have to do it
in front of other people…

46:44.958 --> 46:46.958
Zhoop! I freeze.

46:47.041 --> 46:50.208
Did you really think telling Jodi
you were in <i>Cats </i>would impress her?

46:51.041 --> 46:52.333
Or anyone?

46:53.625 --> 46:57.291
If you are not moved by singing cats,

46:57.375 --> 46:58.750
you have no soul.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.708
Well, good thing I'm a cat person.

47:02.791 --> 47:08.125
Oh. Well, I'm a dog person,
so I guess this is never going to work.

47:13.708 --> 47:16.166
You know,
there's something I need to tell you.

47:16.708 --> 47:20.250
Really? 'Cause… 'Cause, you know,
actually, so do I. Yeah.

47:20.333 --> 47:22.666
-Oh, go first.
-No, no, no, please, go ahead.

47:23.291 --> 47:25.000
-Great. Okay. Um…

47:25.083 --> 47:26.500
Okay, um…

47:28.166 --> 47:31.291
Whew. Okay, I'm just gonna--
I'm just gonna say it.

47:31.916 --> 47:32.750
I kissed someone.

47:33.541 --> 47:37.958
And I wanted you to hear it from me,
because I really care about you.

47:38.041 --> 47:40.083
That's something
that's never gonna change.

47:40.166 --> 47:43.375
I just… Dunkleman, wait.
No, no, no, no, I…

47:49.916 --> 47:52.458
-Come on, dude. Help me out.
-This is crazy. Relax.

47:52.541 --> 47:54.000
Just hold the bag for me.

47:54.083 --> 47:56.708
I just want everything
that reminds me of her gone.

47:56.791 --> 48:00.291
-Pictures, memories. Like this.
-No.

48:00.375 --> 48:01.916
Yeah. The Backstreet Boys.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.791
It's gotta go. I can't do it!

48:03.875 --> 48:05.708
What else? Come on. Get--

48:06.791 --> 48:09.416
-Our future dogs!
-No!

48:09.500 --> 48:11.500
-They were. They're gone now!
-No! Penelope and Fifi!

48:11.583 --> 48:15.791
No Dalmatians for Dunkers. Cat. All
the cute animals. Especially the giraffe!

48:15.875 --> 48:17.291
Wait, wait, wait. Why the giraffe?

48:17.375 --> 48:18.666
Because tall!

48:18.750 --> 48:20.875
-That's actually good sense.
-Yes, I know.

48:21.833 --> 48:23.458
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

48:23.541 --> 48:25.625
Come on, Dunk. Can't we talk this out?

48:26.500 --> 48:29.458
Her favorite book.
Yeah, I read this for her.

48:29.541 --> 48:32.458
Hey, just calling
to place my smoothie order for tomorrow.

48:32.541 --> 48:34.541
Never making a smoothie again.
That can go.

48:34.625 --> 48:35.833
Too soon? Yeah. Too soon.

48:35.916 --> 48:39.041
Why are there so many photos?
I didn't even look good in this one.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.375
I'm gonna keep this for myself.

48:41.083 --> 48:43.333
This isn't fair. We were broken up.

48:43.416 --> 48:45.916
The camera she got me
for my 15th birthday.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.958
This? This has gotta go. Catch.

48:49.708 --> 48:50.708
Gone.

48:50.791 --> 48:52.791
I think you'll regret
throwing all this out.

48:52.875 --> 48:55.250
I'm up to my ears in regret,
so what's one more?

48:59.291 --> 49:02.250
-Hey! Oh! Oh no!

49:02.333 --> 49:04.875
-Oh no. What's happened?

49:04.958 --> 49:07.791
Ingvar has been cheating on me
with Ebba Oloffson!

49:07.875 --> 49:08.958
What? How do you know?

49:09.041 --> 49:12.375
Gunborg Bjork saw them kissing last night
at the Jokkmokk Festival!

49:12.458 --> 49:15.083
I just called Ingvar,
and I said, "I'm done with you!"

49:15.166 --> 49:17.541
-Good!
-And relationships. Forever!

49:17.625 --> 49:20.708
Yes! Yes! You know,
when I was in the second grade,

49:20.791 --> 49:23.625
I wrote Jodi a note that said,
"Will you go out with me? Yes or no?"

49:23.708 --> 49:26.166
And she wrote in "Maybe."

49:26.875 --> 49:28.958
Our relationship was doomed
from the start.

49:29.041 --> 49:30.833
-We don't need them.
-No, we don't.

49:30.916 --> 49:32.125
-Delete permanently.
-Yeah.

49:32.208 --> 49:34.208
-Delete <i>permanently.</i>
-Yeah!

49:34.291 --> 49:36.000
-Delete permanently!
-Nice!

49:38.541 --> 49:40.166
I just had a great idea, Stella.

49:41.333 --> 49:45.375
-You and I should form an alliance.
-An alliance?

49:45.458 --> 49:47.791
Let's say they want
to get back together with us.

49:47.875 --> 49:51.125
We can remind each other
of this exact moment,

49:51.208 --> 49:54.625
and prevent each other
from ever feeling this kind of pain again!

49:54.708 --> 49:55.750
-I'm in!
-Great!

49:55.833 --> 49:57.250
What about you?

49:57.333 --> 49:59.625
I am not going to be a part
of your stupid alliance.

49:59.708 --> 50:03.250
Look, I've spent my entire life
just waiting around for her.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.291
I have the bag of stuff to prove it.

50:05.958 --> 50:09.208
Look at all this stuff.
I've got… pictures in here.

50:09.291 --> 50:11.416
I've got mementos.

50:12.208 --> 50:14.166
The camera she bought me when I was 15.

50:14.250 --> 50:17.125
You know what? Maybe Jodi
wasn't supposed to be my destiny.

50:17.208 --> 50:20.916
Maybe this was the path
I was supposed to go down. Photography.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.791
Check it out. Who wants to be
my first subject? Let's shoot.

50:31.458 --> 50:32.291


50:32.375 --> 50:35.375
Forming the alliance is only phase one.
All right? Phase two…

50:36.166 --> 50:39.000
Phase two is where we show our exes
that we don't need them.

50:39.083 --> 50:42.833
-That we're living our best lives.
-We don't need relationships to be happy.

50:42.916 --> 50:44.625
Thank you, yes. That we're not…

50:44.708 --> 50:46.000
dying inside.

50:46.083 --> 50:47.916
I don't miss Ingvar at all.

50:49.708 --> 50:53.416
Oh, right, yeah. Okay. How are you
doing that? Got this leg up here.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.916
Okay. Oh, this is a little tougher than I…

50:57.000 --> 50:58.416
Taking the picture. Here we go.

50:59.416 --> 51:01.875
You hate yoga. You have a weak core.

51:04.041 --> 51:06.791
Well, those things
are just dangerous.

51:08.583 --> 51:10.833
Oh! The puppies!

51:11.875 --> 51:13.416
Oh my God, they're so… No!

51:14.833 --> 51:16.833
Balloon animals? Are you five now?

51:19.166 --> 51:21.416
Come on. It's not even Halloween.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.583


51:23.291 --> 51:24.833
Why is she braiding his hair?

51:24.916 --> 51:27.916
Okay, back to the puppies.
I'm just going to crop them out.

51:28.916 --> 51:29.750
They're cute.

51:31.208 --> 51:33.666
-Hey, Harper, I really need to--
-Ah-buh-buh-buh-buh…

51:34.833 --> 51:39.083
Chess teaches focus, creative thinking,
and how to be quick on your feet.

51:39.583 --> 51:42.541
All of which
are going to sharpen my interview skills.

51:43.458 --> 51:44.375
Hmm!

51:49.416 --> 51:53.666
Checkmate! Hah!
Wow, I did not see that coming.

51:53.750 --> 51:55.166
Dunkleman broke up with me.

51:55.250 --> 51:58.375
I kissed somebody else and told him.
Now he's not responding to me.

51:58.458 --> 52:00.625
It looks like he's living his best life!

52:01.458 --> 52:04.208
And he even threw a puppy party! I mean--

52:12.500 --> 52:14.708
Why is this the first
I'm hearing about this?

52:14.791 --> 52:15.875
You're leaving soon,

52:15.958 --> 52:19.958
so I'm trying to wean myself off
asking for advice when I have a problem.

52:20.041 --> 52:22.250
I'm still here. Wean on me.

52:22.333 --> 52:24.000
Okay, what do I do?

52:24.583 --> 52:26.958
When Diego and I broke up,
and I kissed Alexander--

52:27.041 --> 52:28.416
Harper, this is not about you.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.166
Right, I always forget that.

52:30.958 --> 52:34.000
Okay. If he's not
returning texts or calls,

52:34.083 --> 52:37.500
you need to knock on his door
and force him to talk things out.

52:37.583 --> 52:38.708
What do I say?

52:39.291 --> 52:41.291
You're an actress now. Let's improv.

52:41.375 --> 52:43.833
It'll be good practice for both of us.
I'll be Dunkleman.

52:43.916 --> 52:45.041
Okay? And you be you.

52:45.583 --> 52:47.083
-Ready?
-Okay… Okay.

52:47.166 --> 52:48.750
And action.

52:48.833 --> 52:50.958
Okay, uh, Dunkleman, look,

52:51.041 --> 52:53.750
I know that you're probably
really, really upset with me--

52:53.833 --> 52:56.000
Of course I'm upset.

52:56.083 --> 52:59.083
You kissed someone else
mere moments after we broke up.

52:59.166 --> 53:01.958
Did the last three months
mean nothing to you?

53:02.041 --> 53:04.583
Was our entire relationship
just some big joke?

53:04.666 --> 53:07.541
-What?
-I make you smoothies every day, Jodi!

53:07.625 --> 53:10.166
-I know. No.
-I stood on crates! You're a monster!

53:10.250 --> 53:13.625
I know. I know.
I'm-- I'm the worst. I'm so sorry.

53:13.708 --> 53:15.166
-I--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:15.250 --> 53:18.125
I'm just preparing you
for the worst-case scenario.

53:18.208 --> 53:22.333
Oh. Okay, so he's, like--
He's not going to say, like, any of that.

53:22.416 --> 53:24.541
-No.

53:25.416 --> 53:27.666
Okay, okay. Good.

53:28.250 --> 53:29.916
-Well, he might.

53:35.208 --> 53:36.041
Stella?

53:40.583 --> 53:41.541
Hi.

53:42.333 --> 53:43.625
Is Dunkleman home?

53:45.333 --> 53:46.166
Hello, Jodi.

53:46.708 --> 53:47.916
Hi.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Hi.

53:51.958 --> 53:55.125
Wow, uh…
I missed the memo, I guess.

53:56.875 --> 53:57.791
Oh, the flannels?

53:57.875 --> 54:00.375
We're trying to start a trend.
Thanks for noticing.

54:01.208 --> 54:03.625
Sorry, but I don't need this anymore.

54:04.125 --> 54:05.208
It was a gift.

54:06.041 --> 54:08.333
It just doesn't feel right to keep it.

54:09.250 --> 54:10.291
Good day.

54:23.416 --> 54:24.333
Hello.

54:25.583 --> 54:26.458
Hi.

54:27.958 --> 54:30.166
So, uh, about the other night.

54:31.416 --> 54:32.291
-Yeah, look.
-Yeah.

54:32.375 --> 54:35.083
I had the best time.

54:35.875 --> 54:39.583
But you didn't say anything
to me afterwards. Or since, really, so…

54:40.125 --> 54:41.791
-Yeah, I…

54:41.875 --> 54:46.083
My boyfriend and I had just broken up,
and I mean just,

54:46.166 --> 54:48.666
so I don't think I was expecting…

54:49.958 --> 54:53.041
that to happen so soon afterwards.

54:53.125 --> 54:56.083
We-- We don't have
to rush into anything, okay?

54:56.916 --> 54:59.166
I just-- I just wanna
get to know you better.

55:01.250 --> 55:02.250
Okay.

55:02.333 --> 55:06.166
So, you, uh, going
to the burning ceremony Saturday night?

55:06.250 --> 55:10.083
I heard something about that.
What is it exactly?

55:10.166 --> 55:12.000
Well, it's before tech week starts.

55:12.083 --> 55:15.166
Some of the cast,
they get together at, uh, Crescent Park.

55:15.250 --> 55:18.083
Everyone brings
a little something to throw in, you know.

55:18.166 --> 55:19.833
Anything to help clear their minds,

55:19.916 --> 55:22.416
get rid of any negative energy
before opening night.

55:23.166 --> 55:24.500
That sounds--

55:24.583 --> 55:26.750
-Cheesy. I know, it is so cheesy.

55:26.833 --> 55:28.125
But it's gonna be great.

55:28.208 --> 55:31.333
Yeah. I, um… I actually have
a birthday party Saturday night.

55:31.416 --> 55:36.083
Maybe you can come to the bonfire first
and hit up the party afterwards?

55:36.166 --> 55:38.750
I really don't know
how much fun I'll be right now.

55:38.833 --> 55:40.750
You're the lead. You should go.

55:40.833 --> 55:42.000
It'll be fun.

55:43.375 --> 55:44.250
Uh…

55:45.166 --> 55:46.125
Okay, I'll go.

55:46.208 --> 55:49.250
-I'll see you Saturday.
-I will see you Saturday.

55:51.666 --> 55:54.541
-Actually--
-Yeah, I'm chemistry…

55:54.625 --> 55:55.708
-Art.
-]Jodi] Ah.

55:58.250 --> 56:03.250
So, my dad lives in Arizona,
and he has never seen me in a show.

56:03.333 --> 56:06.833
Every year, he says he'll try
to make it out for one, and I believe him,

56:06.916 --> 56:09.541
but he never comes, just sends a postcard.

56:10.750 --> 56:12.750
This is the year I stop believing.

56:15.958 --> 56:16.833
Very nice.

56:17.375 --> 56:18.208
Thank you.

56:18.291 --> 56:21.458
All right, um… So, growing up,

56:22.333 --> 56:26.000
I had such messed-up body issues

56:26.083 --> 56:30.041
that I'd wear these oversized T-shirts
so kids wouldn't make fun of me at school.

56:30.708 --> 56:34.208
And of course,
this did not help the matter.

56:35.583 --> 56:38.333
Hey, hey, look,
they were cool back in the day,

56:38.416 --> 56:39.916
just not on me, and it's all right.

56:40.000 --> 56:46.000
Anyway, look, I don't know if anyone is
truly 100% comfortable in their own skin,

56:46.625 --> 56:48.416
but, one day, I hope to be.

56:55.750 --> 56:57.583
Told you it was cheesy.

56:57.666 --> 56:59.875
It was actually really cool.

57:01.083 --> 57:01.916
Thank you.

57:02.875 --> 57:03.833
Yeah.

57:09.083 --> 57:11.333
Okay, I'll go. Um…

57:15.666 --> 57:17.958
My boyfriend and I just broke up.

57:19.083 --> 57:21.333
And, uh, he was my first boyfriend,

57:21.833 --> 57:25.791
which I've heard
is the hardest one to get over.

57:27.166 --> 57:28.916
Anyways, uh, he…

57:34.416 --> 57:35.666
He gave me these.

57:36.500 --> 57:40.250
It's probably one of the sweetest things
anyone has ever done for me.

57:41.916 --> 57:44.125
But as long as these exist,

57:44.208 --> 57:47.166
I don't think I'll be able to move on.

57:48.583 --> 57:49.958
And I want to move on.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.416
I need to move on.

57:55.916 --> 57:59.750
So, um, this is the first step.

57:59.833 --> 58:01.083
Okay.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.125
-Wait, no, no, no, no.
-Hey!

58:23.208 --> 58:25.083
-No! I don't want to move on.
-That's not safe.

58:25.875 --> 58:28.250
-I think it's too late.
-I got it!

58:53.958 --> 58:57.458
Jodi says she'll be here soon.
She's finishing up a cast thing.

58:58.375 --> 58:59.291
Of course she is.

59:00.458 --> 59:02.916
So did you tell your parents
the good news yet?

59:03.000 --> 59:04.208
Not yet.

59:04.291 --> 59:05.458
Fareeda's shirts sold out!

59:07.416 --> 59:08.250
No way!

59:08.333 --> 59:10.000
-Well, that's wonderful, dear!

59:10.083 --> 59:11.875
-You should be proud of yourself.
-Yeah.

59:11.958 --> 59:14.500
I am. Are you?

59:14.583 --> 59:16.583
-Of course we are.
-Yes.

59:17.708 --> 59:21.458
But you turned 17 today, and it's time
to get serious about your future.

59:21.541 --> 59:24.708
And it's not that we don't think
that you're talented, because we do.

59:24.791 --> 59:27.250
But the odds of succeeding
in the fashion industry

59:27.333 --> 59:29.208
are next to impossible, sweetheart.

59:29.291 --> 59:32.750
-Medical school is a safer career path.
-Exactly. Yes.

59:32.833 --> 59:36.791
With all due respect, one of the many
things I've admired about your daughter

59:36.875 --> 59:38.541
is that she forges her own path.

59:40.750 --> 59:43.500
I can't wait to see
what's waiting for her at the end of it.

59:48.833 --> 59:50.541
-Can I get you anything else?
-No.

59:50.625 --> 59:53.083
-But you can put him on a separate check.
-Honey.

59:55.125 --> 59:56.208
Uh…

59:56.291 --> 59:58.125
-I'm kidding.

59:58.208 --> 59:59.500
I'm kidding.

59:59.583 --> 1:00:02.000
-I am not kidding.
-Hm?

1:00:02.083 --> 1:00:03.791
-I am watching that boy.
-Oh my…

1:00:11.208 --> 1:00:16.916
So, uh, it turns out
I am not ready to move on.

1:00:17.708 --> 1:00:18.708
Yeah.

1:00:19.375 --> 1:00:20.666
Appears that way.

1:00:21.333 --> 1:00:23.000
I'm so sorry.

1:00:23.750 --> 1:00:25.041
For what?

1:00:26.416 --> 1:00:29.125
I feel like I led you on with that kiss.

1:00:29.208 --> 1:00:31.041
You didn't lead me on.

1:00:31.541 --> 1:00:33.833
As much as it pains me to say this,

1:00:33.916 --> 1:00:35.958
I don't think
you should give up on your ex.

1:00:37.083 --> 1:00:38.791
Because if you do,

1:00:40.291 --> 1:00:44.208
this pair of crispy, ankle-strap platforms

1:00:44.291 --> 1:00:46.208
will be the only memory
of your time together.

1:00:48.875 --> 1:00:50.625
You really know your shoes.

1:00:50.708 --> 1:00:52.416
I grew up with three sisters.

1:00:53.958 --> 1:00:55.125
Friends?

1:00:56.166 --> 1:00:57.000
Friends.

1:00:58.291 --> 1:00:59.125
Kimmy!

1:00:59.208 --> 1:01:00.833
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey!

1:01:00.916 --> 1:01:03.541
-Dude, that was so cool!
-What?

1:01:03.625 --> 1:01:05.166
You saved Jodi's shoes.

1:01:05.250 --> 1:01:07.666
They were designer.
It'd be a sin to let 'em burn.

1:01:08.333 --> 1:01:11.458
-You are evolving.
-You take that back.

1:01:11.541 --> 1:01:14.833
Like a tiny caterpillar
into a beautiful chrysalis.

1:01:16.083 --> 1:01:19.125
A chrysalis is the transition state
between caterpillar and butterfly.

1:01:19.208 --> 1:01:21.583
-I know what it is.
-I knew you had a good heart.

1:01:21.666 --> 1:01:24.166
-You know nothing.
-Sure, Kimmy.

1:01:24.250 --> 1:01:26.125
Whatever you say.

1:01:28.166 --> 1:01:29.166
Nothing!

1:01:42.583 --> 1:01:44.958
Yeah! Make a wish.

1:01:45.791 --> 1:01:46.833
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

1:01:46.916 --> 1:01:48.125
There we go!

1:01:49.458 --> 1:01:54.041
<i>Next up on stage,</i>
<i>please welcome Fareeda and Stig.</i>

1:01:55.291 --> 1:01:57.458
-What did you do?
-I signed us up for a song.

1:01:57.541 --> 1:01:59.416
-No. No. Come on, no.
-Yeah.

1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:00.541
-No, no, no, no.
-Yeah.

1:02:00.625 --> 1:02:02.208
-Come on! Come on.
-No.

1:02:02.291 --> 1:02:04.000
-Come on!
-Just go!

1:02:05.541 --> 1:02:07.708
Fareeda, why would you think
this is a good idea?

1:02:07.791 --> 1:02:10.666
The only way to conquer your fear
of singing in front of people

1:02:10.750 --> 1:02:11.708
is to just do it.

1:02:19.541 --> 1:02:22.458
He's a little shy.
Give him a hand, people.

1:02:22.958 --> 1:02:24.125
-Whoo!

1:02:24.208 --> 1:02:25.666
-No. No.

1:02:31.666 --> 1:02:33.958
Just a little something
to remind you of home.

1:03:15.541 --> 1:03:19.666
-Sing it, Stig!

1:03:52.750 --> 1:03:54.416
Whoo!

1:03:57.125 --> 1:04:00.041
Go, Stig! Go, Stig! Whoo!

1:04:00.125 --> 1:04:01.791
Sweden!

1:04:03.083 --> 1:04:06.000
-That was so much fun. Aah!
-So much fun.

1:04:06.083 --> 1:04:08.000
-Can I put these in your trunk?
-Sure.

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:09.833
No, wait!

1:04:14.458 --> 1:04:15.708
Those are my shirts.

1:04:16.583 --> 1:04:17.416
Yeah.

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:19.416
You bought them all?

1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:21.833
You were losing confidence
in yourself. I--

1:04:21.916 --> 1:04:24.333
I thought this might help
give some of it back.

1:04:25.458 --> 1:04:26.583
That is so…

1:04:28.625 --> 1:04:30.416
unbelievably stupid.

1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:32.041
Why was it stupid?

1:04:32.125 --> 1:04:35.041
Because nothing's changed. I still failed.

1:04:35.125 --> 1:04:38.833
But if you want something bad enough,
you go for it until you get it.

1:04:38.916 --> 1:04:42.458
You don't take no for an answer.
Just like I did with you and Dunkers.

1:04:42.541 --> 1:04:46.500
You wanted nothing to do with me,
and now look. We're all friends again.

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.625
If I had given up, I…
Well, I wouldn't even be here right now.

1:04:52.958 --> 1:04:54.833
Well, I'm really glad you are here.

1:04:57.208 --> 1:04:58.458
Yeah, me too.

1:04:59.541 --> 1:05:01.125
-Happy birthday.

1:05:29.291 --> 1:05:30.708
That was very bad.

1:05:30.791 --> 1:05:34.458
Oh no. Oh, I ate a lot of garlic,
Fareeda, I'm sorry.

1:05:34.541 --> 1:05:37.333
Oh, I'm sorry. Let me get a mint,
and then we'll try it again?

1:05:37.416 --> 1:05:40.250
Well, no, not the kiss.
I just broke girl code.

1:05:40.333 --> 1:05:41.208
You did?

1:05:41.291 --> 1:05:44.000
I can't kiss a guy
my best friend used to like.

1:05:44.083 --> 1:05:46.208
Sorry, I'm not up to date on the codes.

1:05:48.250 --> 1:05:49.708
Now she shows up?

1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:52.916
-Act cool. Act cool.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:05:53.416 --> 1:05:57.541
Sorry. Oh my God,
I am so, so sorry that I'm late. I--

1:05:58.416 --> 1:05:59.708
-Happy birthday.

1:05:59.791 --> 1:06:01.666
-Don't sweat it.
-Seriously?

1:06:01.750 --> 1:06:04.250
I just missed your birthday dinner.
You're not mad?

1:06:04.333 --> 1:06:08.125
No. I mean, it's not cool
to miss your best friend's birthday,

1:06:08.208 --> 1:06:09.541
but things happen.

1:06:10.041 --> 1:06:12.416
And I'm a very forgiving person.

1:06:13.291 --> 1:06:15.208
We should all be more forgiving.

1:06:15.791 --> 1:06:18.541
Because like I said, things happen.

1:06:19.625 --> 1:06:20.625
Yeah.

1:06:21.750 --> 1:06:22.666
They do.

1:06:23.250 --> 1:06:24.166
Yeah.

1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:26.500
Where's Dunk?

1:06:26.583 --> 1:06:28.416
-I wanna talk to him.
-Inside.

1:06:29.333 --> 1:06:32.958
-Okay. Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:35.208
Have fun.

1:06:36.375 --> 1:06:37.583
Phew!

1:06:52.250 --> 1:06:55.166
<i>Looks like Dunk's</i>
<i>still living his best life,</i>

1:06:55.250 --> 1:06:57.208
<i>and you're still living your worst.</i>

1:07:06.250 --> 1:07:08.791
Wait, so Juilliard
has a summer theater program?

1:07:08.875 --> 1:07:11.458
Yes. If she wants
to apply there for college,

1:07:11.541 --> 1:07:14.333
getting in the summer program
will give her a leg up on the competition.

1:07:14.416 --> 1:07:16.666
<i>They won't be talking</i>
<i>about Juilliard</i>

1:07:16.750 --> 1:07:18.750
<i>after they see you in the show.</i>

1:07:18.833 --> 1:07:21.666
I think we should hire
a professional videographer for the show.

1:07:21.750 --> 1:07:24.083
-Yes! I'm seeing three-camera set up.
-Yep.

1:07:24.166 --> 1:07:25.041
Oh, at least.

1:07:25.125 --> 1:07:26.875
-Right?
-Have you two lost your minds?

1:07:26.958 --> 1:07:27.875
-Hey!
-What?

1:07:27.958 --> 1:07:29.916
It's never too early to start thinking--

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:33.250
No, this is the last thing
I need to think about right now.

1:07:33.333 --> 1:07:34.166
Is something wrong?

1:07:34.833 --> 1:07:38.041
I've been spending all my time
on the show, so I'm failing calculus.

1:07:38.125 --> 1:07:39.416
I just lost Dunkleman.

1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:43.625
Then I burned the shoes that he gave me,
and I'm going to be horrible in the show,

1:07:43.708 --> 1:07:47.875
and you guys just keep inviting people
that are just gonna sit and watch me fail.

1:07:47.958 --> 1:07:51.416
And Harper, she's moving 2,000 miles away,

1:07:51.500 --> 1:07:56.208
and there is no way in hell that
Juilliard, or anyone, for that matter,

1:07:56.291 --> 1:07:59.166
is gonna want anything to do with me,
so I just…

1:08:00.250 --> 1:08:01.791
Are you okay?

1:08:01.875 --> 1:08:04.125
Mom, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

1:08:04.208 --> 1:08:06.375
Pull over. Richie, pull over.

1:08:10.250 --> 1:08:11.875
Mom, I--

1:08:11.958 --> 1:08:13.166
-You're okay.
-I can't breathe.

1:08:13.250 --> 1:08:14.708
-You're okay. Just relax.
-I'm not.

1:08:14.791 --> 1:08:16.041
Slow deep breaths. In.

1:08:16.125 --> 1:08:17.208
-Out.
-I can't.

1:08:17.291 --> 1:08:19.083
You're not in any danger.

1:08:19.166 --> 1:08:22.375
-Just tell yourself, "This is temporary."
-This is temporary.

1:08:22.458 --> 1:08:24.000
-"It's not forever."
-It's not forever.

1:08:24.083 --> 1:08:26.500
-"This will end."
-This will end.

1:08:26.583 --> 1:08:27.416
Here.

1:08:30.083 --> 1:08:31.166
There you go.

1:08:32.666 --> 1:08:35.375
How did you know what to say?

1:08:35.458 --> 1:08:37.416
Your mom has been backstage

1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:39.791
at, like, a thousand beauty pageants.

1:08:39.875 --> 1:08:43.416
So I tried to learn some tips
in case it ever happened to Harper.

1:08:44.291 --> 1:08:46.666
I'm so sorry that I'm
the screwed-up daughter.

1:08:46.791 --> 1:08:50.166
-I don't…
-Oh, stop that! You're perfect as you are.

1:08:51.791 --> 1:08:54.875
Aah, anxiety attacks are really common.

1:08:54.958 --> 1:08:57.291
-Especially with parents like us.
-Dad.

1:08:57.375 --> 1:09:01.708
We have put way too much pressure on you
with the invites and the Juilliard.

1:09:01.791 --> 1:09:03.666
We should have seen it coming.

1:09:03.750 --> 1:09:07.333
So, could you, um…
Could you guys give me some tips,

1:09:07.416 --> 1:09:10.708
you know, just in case
it ever happens again?

1:09:11.291 --> 1:09:14.000
Yeah. We can do that.

1:09:14.083 --> 1:09:17.791
I mean, you two did screw me up.
The least you could do is try to fix me.

1:09:17.875 --> 1:09:19.583
-Oh, too soon.

1:09:19.666 --> 1:09:21.166
Yeah, not funny yet.

1:09:23.625 --> 1:09:24.750
Okay, now it's funny.

1:09:24.833 --> 1:09:26.083
-Okay.

1:09:39.208 --> 1:09:40.375
Wow, uh…

1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:42.708
Packing already?

1:09:43.250 --> 1:09:45.291
I just thought I'd get a head start on it.

1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:47.833
So…

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.708
I've been sitting here all night

1:09:52.791 --> 1:09:54.708
staring at these boxes.

1:09:56.333 --> 1:09:58.541
And I can't bring myself to tape them up.

1:09:59.458 --> 1:10:02.666
Because ever since I was eight years old,
no matter what I did,

1:10:03.208 --> 1:10:04.208
you were there.

1:10:06.208 --> 1:10:07.916
You guys are my support system.

1:10:08.708 --> 1:10:11.166
-And now I won't have that anymore.
-No.

1:10:11.666 --> 1:10:16.708
Just because we're not in the audience
doesn't mean that we're not there for you.

1:10:16.791 --> 1:10:18.500
But what if I tank this job?

1:10:20.291 --> 1:10:21.708
Or what if I get fired?

1:10:22.541 --> 1:10:26.333
What if beauty pageants
are the only thing I'm actually good at?

1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.291
Harper, since when do you…

1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.875
get that voice?

1:10:33.666 --> 1:10:34.750
Since always.

1:10:34.833 --> 1:10:37.000
-Surprise!
-What?

1:10:37.083 --> 1:10:38.833
What about the,

1:10:39.333 --> 1:10:43.375
"If you don't learn to control it,
it's gonna control you"?

1:10:43.458 --> 1:10:45.333
Yeah, I don't know how to control it.

1:10:46.500 --> 1:10:48.000
I just wanted to sound like I did.

1:10:48.083 --> 1:10:51.583
You don't always have to have
the right answer for everything.

1:10:52.833 --> 1:10:55.666
Well, I do
if I want people to take me seriously.

1:10:57.041 --> 1:11:00.500
And not just see me
as some ex-beauty queen.

1:11:00.583 --> 1:11:02.500
You want people to take you seriously?

1:11:03.666 --> 1:11:07.750
Then know that you don't have
to be afraid to say, "I don't know,"

1:11:07.833 --> 1:11:08.833
if you don't know.

1:11:09.708 --> 1:11:12.625
I'll tell you one thing
I definitely don't know.

1:11:15.250 --> 1:11:17.416
How I'm gonna survive without you.

1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:18.958
Me neither.

1:11:21.791 --> 1:11:24.541
-So how am I gonna do this?

1:11:24.625 --> 1:11:26.166
Pack, or… or leave us?

1:11:26.250 --> 1:11:27.583
Both.

1:11:28.583 --> 1:11:29.500
Both.

1:11:34.875 --> 1:11:36.458
One box at a time.

1:11:39.208 --> 1:11:41.625
-Whoa.
-Ready? That was a good one.

1:11:41.708 --> 1:11:43.458
-Hefty!
-You ready for these arms?

1:11:55.083 --> 1:11:57.000
Hey, man, you can't sleep either?

1:11:58.666 --> 1:11:59.750
Not a wink.

1:12:00.625 --> 1:12:01.916
What's your excuse?

1:12:03.541 --> 1:12:06.166
Well, I kissed someone.

1:12:08.708 --> 1:12:11.458
-Was it Jodi? Tell me it wasn't.
-No, it wasn't. I swear.

1:12:11.541 --> 1:12:12.541
Who was it?

1:12:12.625 --> 1:12:14.291
It was Fareeda.

1:12:15.541 --> 1:12:17.291
-What? Fareeda?
-Yeah.

1:12:18.083 --> 1:12:19.291
That's awesome, right?

1:12:19.375 --> 1:12:22.958
Except she says
it can't go anywhere because of girl code.

1:12:23.041 --> 1:12:24.125
-Aww.
-Ugh.

1:12:24.208 --> 1:12:27.416
If-- If that's what she wants,
then you have to respect that.

1:12:28.333 --> 1:12:32.458
I should've joined your stupid
alliance when I had the chance.

1:12:32.541 --> 1:12:35.208
Don't say that. Isn't it better
to have loved and lost

1:12:35.291 --> 1:12:37.166
than to have never loved at all?

1:12:37.916 --> 1:12:40.875
I wouldn't take back the three months
I spent with Jodi for anything.

1:12:41.666 --> 1:12:45.916
The dinner party? The turducken?
You ruined three birds, Dunkers.

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.666
Damn, man. I wouldn't take it back.

1:12:47.750 --> 1:12:49.250
You know, in a weird way,

1:12:50.500 --> 1:12:53.500
it never would have happened
if you didn't show up,

1:12:53.583 --> 1:12:55.458
so I kind of owe it to you.

1:12:55.541 --> 1:12:58.916
Glad to be of service, Dunk.
That's what friends do.

1:12:59.958 --> 1:13:01.375
Pyeoow!

1:13:03.625 --> 1:13:07.125
I know you're supposed to leave
when the semester ends.

1:13:07.208 --> 1:13:08.083
Yeah.

1:13:08.166 --> 1:13:11.333
But if… Ugh. I mean, if you wanted to,

1:13:13.833 --> 1:13:15.958
you should stay here for the summer.

1:13:16.041 --> 1:13:17.375
-Here? Me?
-Yes.

1:13:17.458 --> 1:13:18.333
-Yes.
-Dunk?

1:13:18.416 --> 1:13:19.916
-Yes.
-Me and Dunk? Stig and Dunk?

1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:23.500
-Yes! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-Oh God, all right.

1:13:23.583 --> 1:13:25.875
Dude! It's going to be
the best summer ever!

1:13:30.125 --> 1:13:31.666


1:13:31.750 --> 1:13:33.083


1:13:33.166 --> 1:13:34.208


1:14:00.916 --> 1:14:03.375
Wait, you bought all of them?

1:14:03.458 --> 1:14:05.541
Yeah,
she's cool with it now,

1:14:05.625 --> 1:14:07.916
but when she saw it, she flipped out.

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.791
-I didn't flip out.
-Oh, you did too.

1:14:10.875 --> 1:14:12.833
Shut up.

1:14:14.708 --> 1:14:15.791
Hey, Fareeda.

1:14:17.416 --> 1:14:18.333
I know.

1:14:20.458 --> 1:14:21.416
Know what?

1:14:23.916 --> 1:14:25.250
I know.

1:14:26.708 --> 1:14:29.041
I actually knew
the other night in the parking lot.

1:14:30.541 --> 1:14:32.041
And it's okay.

1:14:32.708 --> 1:14:33.875
Are you sure?

1:14:35.208 --> 1:14:41.125
Trust me, it is the only thing in my life
that I am sure of right now.

1:14:46.375 --> 1:14:47.583
-Thank you.
-Of course.

1:14:48.708 --> 1:14:50.791
Did we just reverse the girl codes?

1:14:51.291 --> 1:14:53.000
-Mmkay.

1:14:53.583 --> 1:14:55.000
Okay, you two have fun.

1:15:00.625 --> 1:15:02.958
-Got that mint?
-Oh, I have that mint.

1:15:14.833 --> 1:15:16.708
Surprised to see you here.

1:15:17.958 --> 1:15:20.291
Just doing my part to support the arts.

1:15:22.041 --> 1:15:22.916
Yeah.

1:15:24.916 --> 1:15:28.958
Okay, look, I know that
you don't wanna talk to me and I get it.

1:15:29.750 --> 1:15:31.166
I do.

1:15:33.166 --> 1:15:34.125
But I wanna let you know

1:15:34.208 --> 1:15:36.458
I'm gonna leave you a ticket
at the box office tomorrow.

1:15:38.458 --> 1:15:42.041
Although, who knows?
Maybe I just won't show up myself.

1:15:42.125 --> 1:15:44.916
-Wait, what?
-I don't know. I just…

1:15:46.375 --> 1:15:48.041
I've just been hearing that

1:15:49.208 --> 1:15:50.833
maybe I'm not good enough,

1:15:51.416 --> 1:15:54.708
or maybe I'm just not ready
to do this sort of thing yet.

1:15:54.791 --> 1:15:56.958
Well, whoever's saying that is wrong.

1:15:59.416 --> 1:16:01.208
They don't know you like I know you.

1:16:02.250 --> 1:16:05.208
Trust me. That's all just noise.
You're gonna crush it.

1:16:07.916 --> 1:16:08.875
Dunkers.

1:16:10.250 --> 1:16:12.125
I need a spot.

1:16:21.583 --> 1:16:22.916
Glad we had this talk.

1:16:24.375 --> 1:16:25.708
What? What's wrong?

1:16:26.291 --> 1:16:30.125
It's Ingvar. He face called me.
He wants to get back together.

1:16:31.083 --> 1:16:32.333
Let me talk to this guy.

1:16:33.208 --> 1:16:34.500
Let me talk to him!

1:16:34.583 --> 1:16:36.125
Listen here, Ingvar!

1:16:37.916 --> 1:16:39.875
Holy crap. He's gorgeous.

1:16:39.958 --> 1:16:41.791
His face is so symmetrical.

1:16:41.875 --> 1:16:43.708
-Keep going.
-Okay.

1:16:43.791 --> 1:16:45.166
Listen, Ingvar.

1:16:45.250 --> 1:16:47.125
You broke Stella's heart.

1:16:47.208 --> 1:16:50.375
Shame on you for trying to trick her into
thinking you can piece it back together.

1:16:50.458 --> 1:16:52.458
So text me the name

1:16:52.541 --> 1:16:54.750
of whatever hair product
it is you're using,

1:16:54.833 --> 1:16:56.000
and then lose her number.

1:16:56.083 --> 1:16:57.625
Yep. Bye.

1:16:59.416 --> 1:17:02.791
Boom! That's how you spot. Come on.

1:17:03.833 --> 1:17:04.833
What's wrong?

1:17:05.833 --> 1:17:07.083
I still want that.

1:17:11.125 --> 1:17:12.583
Ew. Your brother?

1:17:13.083 --> 1:17:16.083
No, not my brother. And not Ingvar.

1:17:18.875 --> 1:17:22.166
Isn't there a little part of you
that still wants that with Jodi?

1:17:26.750 --> 1:17:27.583
No.

1:17:32.875 --> 1:17:36.208
Yeah, of course, obviously.
Like every part of me.

1:17:37.416 --> 1:17:38.250
But…

1:17:39.666 --> 1:17:42.041
I just-- I don't know
if I can trust her again.

1:17:42.125 --> 1:17:45.041
Your whole life,
you put her on a pedestal.

1:17:46.166 --> 1:17:49.625
The second she does something
that ruins your perfect image of her,

1:17:50.708 --> 1:17:52.125
you push her off of it.

1:18:00.916 --> 1:18:02.916
-Hey!

1:18:04.166 --> 1:18:06.041
-That's my daughter.

1:18:06.125 --> 1:18:07.458
-That's my kiddo.
-Mom.

1:18:07.541 --> 1:18:09.208
-Mom, we gotta…
-Okay. Sit down.

1:18:09.291 --> 1:18:10.750
-Settle down. Okay.
-Okay.

1:18:10.833 --> 1:18:12.791
I'm good. I'm settled. I'm fine.

1:18:12.875 --> 1:18:14.333
Cool.

1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:16.625
-Look at that.
-So excited.

1:18:44.250 --> 1:18:47.208
<i>Wow, a packed house…</i> <i>packed house…</i>

1:18:47.291 --> 1:18:51.500
<i>Twenty bucks says</i>
<i>you fall flat on your face… face…</i>

1:18:53.208 --> 1:18:57.375
<i>You're about to humiliate yourself</i>
<i>in front of all the people you care about.</i>

1:18:57.958 --> 1:18:59.083
Sorry.

1:18:59.833 --> 1:19:02.666
<i>Except Dunkleman, who didn't show.</i>

1:19:03.416 --> 1:19:05.791
<i>Guess he couldn't bear</i>
<i>to watch you crash and burn.</i>

1:19:05.875 --> 1:19:07.083
Excuse me.

1:19:07.166 --> 1:19:10.833
<i>In a few short hours, you'll go back</i>
<i>to being just the tall girl.</i>

1:19:18.041 --> 1:19:21.458
Okay. This is not forever. It's temporary.

1:19:22.291 --> 1:19:26.875
<i>Aww, look who's trying to ground herself</i>
<i>by tidying up… tidying up…</i>

1:19:26.958 --> 1:19:29.125
<i>How's that workin' out… workin' out…</i>

1:19:29.208 --> 1:19:32.958
<i>Don't you get it?</i>
<i>You will never control me.</i>

1:19:33.041 --> 1:19:34.791
<i>I control you.</i>

1:19:34.875 --> 1:19:35.708
Jodi?

1:19:36.375 --> 1:19:39.125
-You okay? You're on soon.

1:19:39.208 --> 1:19:41.875
Look, I can't… I can't go out there.

1:19:42.458 --> 1:19:44.500
-Why not? Jodi, why not?

1:19:44.583 --> 1:19:48.375
I am afraid I'm going to have
an anxiety attack on stage, okay?

1:19:49.041 --> 1:19:51.250
-You get those too?
-What do you mean, "too"?

1:19:52.083 --> 1:19:53.791
I'm a 17-year-old on planet Earth.

1:19:53.875 --> 1:19:55.833
It'd be weird
if I didn't get anxiety attacks.

1:19:55.916 --> 1:20:00.041
Okay, but you can still go on for me,
right? 'Cause I can't.

1:20:05.416 --> 1:20:06.625
No. No.

1:20:06.708 --> 1:20:08.583
But this is what you wanted, isn't it?

1:20:08.666 --> 1:20:10.833
-Yeah, but not like this.
-Wh--

1:20:10.916 --> 1:20:13.833
But I will stand
in the wings for the entire show.

1:20:14.416 --> 1:20:17.083
And if you get tripped up,
just look over and I'll cue you.

1:20:17.166 --> 1:20:18.083
Okay?

1:20:19.625 --> 1:20:20.666
I've got your back.

1:20:21.666 --> 1:20:23.250
I won't let you fail.

1:20:25.291 --> 1:20:26.125
Thank you.

1:20:27.666 --> 1:20:30.250
Now, go get dressed.

1:20:31.083 --> 1:20:32.833
-Go.
-Yeah.

1:20:40.416 --> 1:20:42.000
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1:20:42.083 --> 1:20:44.291
Putting someone else's needs
before your own?

1:20:44.791 --> 1:20:46.291
I literally almost puked.

1:20:47.958 --> 1:20:49.500
Does kindness always burn?

1:20:50.416 --> 1:20:52.166
Only when you're doing it right.

1:20:53.583 --> 1:20:54.541
Come here, girl.

1:20:55.791 --> 1:20:57.916
Hey, does Jodi ever mention me at all?

1:20:58.000 --> 1:20:59.750
-Let it go, dude.

1:20:59.833 --> 1:21:01.083
Letting it go.

1:21:09.875 --> 1:21:11.958
<i>Break a leg, Jodi… leg, Jodi…</i>

1:21:12.041 --> 1:21:14.875
<i>You're gonna need</i>
<i>all the luck you can get.</i>

1:21:14.958 --> 1:21:18.208
<i>-You're gonna choke.</i>
-<i>It's just noise.</i>

1:21:21.333 --> 1:21:22.583
<i>Breathe.</i>

1:22:55.333 --> 1:22:56.375
Whoo!

1:23:13.125 --> 1:23:15.458
I, Kim MacAfee…

1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:29.166
<i>Wait, so you actually did</i>
<i>forget your lines? How embarrassing!</i>

1:23:29.250 --> 1:23:31.208
<i>Get it together, Jodi.</i>

1:23:31.916 --> 1:23:35.125
Being of sound mind and body…

1:23:36.208 --> 1:23:39.583
…being of sound mind and body…

1:23:39.666 --> 1:23:40.875
-Okay.

1:23:40.958 --> 1:23:42.625
…promise to be loyal to Conrad Birdie…

1:24:28.750 --> 1:24:30.375
<i>-Whoo!
</i>

1:24:30.458 --> 1:24:33.208
-Ha-ha! Yeah!

1:24:33.291 --> 1:24:34.500
Oh, yeah!

1:24:39.125 --> 1:24:40.833
Yeah!

1:24:43.833 --> 1:24:44.708
You did it!

1:24:44.791 --> 1:24:46.208
-We did it.
-Oh!

1:24:46.291 --> 1:24:48.166
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-Whoo!

1:24:48.250 --> 1:24:50.666
Yes! Go, Jodi!

1:24:53.083 --> 1:24:54.708
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo!

1:24:54.791 --> 1:24:57.083
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whooooo!

1:25:00.291 --> 1:25:02.833
-<i>Tonight was just beginner's luck.</i>
-Hey, Jodi.

1:25:02.916 --> 1:25:04.791
-<i>You are still a fraud.</i>
-Hey, guys. Great job.

1:25:04.875 --> 1:25:06.250
-Thanks. You too.
-<i>Oh!</i>

1:25:06.333 --> 1:25:10.041
<i>-You think you can tune me out?</i>
-<i>I was good tonight.</i>

1:25:10.125 --> 1:25:12.375
<i>Hey, I'm talking to you.</i>

1:25:12.458 --> 1:25:15.208
<i>And this dream, it's…</i>
<i>It isn't so crazy.</i>

1:25:15.291 --> 1:25:17.750
-<i>Are you listening to me?</i>
-<i>I can do this.</i>

1:25:17.833 --> 1:25:19.083
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1:25:19.166 --> 1:25:21.708
<i>I'm good enough to do this.</i>

1:25:24.250 --> 1:25:25.250
Hello, Jodi.

1:25:27.833 --> 1:25:28.791
You came.

1:25:31.166 --> 1:25:32.500
Yeah, of course I did.

1:25:34.500 --> 1:25:36.333
Well, I saved you a seat.

1:25:37.875 --> 1:25:41.958
Yeah, I was just up in the lighting booth.
It has a better angle for pictures.

1:25:42.041 --> 1:25:42.875
Oh.

1:25:45.958 --> 1:25:47.125
You were amazing.

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:52.375
Thank you.

1:25:54.625 --> 1:25:56.166
Can I see the pictures?

1:25:56.750 --> 1:25:57.583
Sure.

1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:11.416
Wow.

1:26:12.291 --> 1:26:13.208
Can I…

1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:18.375
These are beautiful.

1:26:20.750 --> 1:26:21.791
It's the camera.

1:26:23.083 --> 1:26:25.166
I think it's the person behind it.

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.958
I think it's the person in front of it.

1:26:40.958 --> 1:26:43.791
I don't know why
it took you so long to use this. You're…

1:26:44.750 --> 1:26:45.916
really good.

1:26:48.750 --> 1:26:51.833
Thanks, but the only reason
I ever told you I was into photography

1:26:51.916 --> 1:26:53.708
is 'cause I thought it sounded cool.

1:26:53.791 --> 1:26:56.708
I mean, this-- this could be your thing.

1:26:56.791 --> 1:26:58.958
Yeah. Maybe.

1:27:01.583 --> 1:27:02.583
I don't know.

1:27:03.666 --> 1:27:07.583
I don't think
I wanna force picking my thing,

1:27:07.666 --> 1:27:10.458
just 'cause it feels like
everyone has theirs figured out.

1:27:11.458 --> 1:27:12.291
I get that.

1:27:16.083 --> 1:27:18.625
Look, I don't know
what I want to do with my life.

1:27:24.583 --> 1:27:26.333
But I know that I want you in it.

1:27:30.208 --> 1:27:31.458
I love you, Jodi.

1:27:38.583 --> 1:27:42.083
And you-- And you're not saying it back,
which is…

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:44.166
…cool. It's fine.

1:27:44.250 --> 1:27:47.750
'Cause it-- Uh-- Ahh, you know,
it's funny… It's fine. It's fine.

1:27:47.833 --> 1:27:50.625
I had this voice in my head
saying I shouldn't say it,

1:27:50.708 --> 1:27:52.500
because I don't wanna
force you into anything.

1:27:52.583 --> 1:27:55.416
I just wanna, like, you know,
tell you how I'm feeling, and it…

1:27:55.500 --> 1:27:59.083
It's fine if you don't feel the same way.
I-- All I'm saying is, no pressure on you.

1:27:59.166 --> 1:28:01.458
I just want to let you know
how I'm feeling because--

1:28:08.125 --> 1:28:09.791
I love you too.

1:28:14.500 --> 1:28:16.416
-Okay!
-Oh, and, um…

1:28:16.500 --> 1:28:19.541
I kind of burned the shoes
that you gave me for homecoming.

1:28:21.666 --> 1:28:22.666
What?

1:28:29.500 --> 1:28:31.708
-Jodi! You were terrific.

1:28:31.791 --> 1:28:33.041
-Thanks.
-Yeah!

1:28:33.750 --> 1:28:36.666
-Hey!
-Oh, Jodi! I'm so proud of you.

1:28:36.750 --> 1:28:39.958
-Thank you.
-I may be biased, but you are a star.

1:28:40.041 --> 1:28:41.791
-You're so sweet.

1:28:43.791 --> 1:28:45.125
-Hi, guys. Thank you.
-Jodi.

1:28:45.208 --> 1:28:47.208
-Oh, thank you! Hi.
-There she is.

1:28:48.958 --> 1:28:51.500
Oh, honey.

1:28:51.583 --> 1:28:53.708
Oh, you took my breath away
tonight, honey.

1:28:53.791 --> 1:28:55.250
Thank you.

1:28:55.333 --> 1:28:57.375
I did not know you could sing like that.

1:28:57.458 --> 1:28:59.291
-You were amazing.
-Thanks, Mom.

1:29:00.041 --> 1:29:02.625
-All right, go have fun.
-Okay, thank you for the party.

1:29:02.708 --> 1:29:04.000
-Yes!

1:29:05.791 --> 1:29:07.250
-Great job tonight.
-Thanks.

1:29:08.458 --> 1:29:10.041
-Hey, Jodi.
-Hey, guys.

1:29:10.125 --> 1:29:11.125
Hi.

1:29:17.416 --> 1:29:21.458
You know, my school back in Sweden
has a foreign exchange student program.

1:29:21.541 --> 1:29:22.375
Hah!

1:29:22.458 --> 1:29:24.416
You think I'm gonna move across the world

1:29:24.500 --> 1:29:27.041
to spend my senior year
with you after one kiss?

1:29:27.125 --> 1:29:30.916
-Come on. Take a chance on me.

1:29:35.375 --> 1:29:40.583
-You killed it, big little sister.
-Thank you, little big sister.

1:29:40.666 --> 1:29:42.958
Okay, do not leave me in suspense.

1:29:43.458 --> 1:29:45.166
How did you control this?

1:29:45.250 --> 1:29:46.166
Oh, I didn't.

1:29:46.250 --> 1:29:48.875
Just for the first time,
I was kind of able to…

1:29:49.541 --> 1:29:51.041
turn down the volume.

1:29:51.125 --> 1:29:52.166
But how?

1:29:52.250 --> 1:29:54.291
I was good tonight.

1:29:56.958 --> 1:29:59.625
If the voice inside my head
refuses to tell me that,

1:29:59.708 --> 1:30:03.166
then… I don't know, I guess
I'm just gonna have to tell myself.

1:30:04.250 --> 1:30:08.791
And just like that,
the teacher has become the student.

1:30:10.166 --> 1:30:11.791
That is not how that saying goes.

1:30:11.875 --> 1:30:13.541
Agree to disagree.

1:30:14.125 --> 1:30:15.208
Mwah!

1:30:17.166 --> 1:30:18.500
-Hey.

1:30:19.916 --> 1:30:20.750
Hey.

1:30:20.833 --> 1:30:23.375
I almost forgot
your opening night present.

1:30:23.916 --> 1:30:27.250
That's so sweet.
Okay. What is it?

1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:34.416
How did you…

1:30:34.500 --> 1:30:36.166
How did you get this?

1:30:36.250 --> 1:30:38.125
Well, the day after we broke up,

1:30:38.208 --> 1:30:41.458
I was doing some Marie Kondo-ing
around the house, and I just found it.

1:30:41.958 --> 1:30:43.291
I love it.

1:30:43.375 --> 1:30:45.458
-I love it! Wow!

1:30:46.833 --> 1:30:48.458
But something's really off.

1:30:49.208 --> 1:30:50.500
It's really off.

1:31:04.416 --> 1:31:07.958
So much better.

1:31:41.291 --> 1:31:44.875
-Oh! Oh!

1:31:47.291 --> 1:31:49.458

-Here we go.

1:31:49.541 --> 1:31:52.250


1:31:52.333 --> 1:31:53.958


1:31:54.041 --> 1:31:56.208
<i>-Oh no!
</i>

1:31:56.291 --> 1:31:58.833
-Aaah!

1:31:58.916 --> 1:32:01.791
-That's right!

1:32:02.375 --> 1:32:06.208


1:32:06.291 --> 1:32:09.875
<i>-There we go!
</i>

1:32:10.791 --> 1:32:12.166


1:32:12.250 --> 1:32:13.875


1:32:13.958 --> 1:32:16.541

Ohh!

1:32:16.625 --> 1:32:20.333


1:32:20.416 --> 1:32:23.291


1:32:23.375 --> 1:32:25.833


1:32:25.916 --> 1:32:28.375


1:32:28.458 --> 1:32:30.916


1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:33.041


1:32:33.125 --> 1:32:35.583


1:32:35.666 --> 1:32:38.125


1:32:38.208 --> 1:32:41.041


1:32:41.125 --> 1:32:42.958

-Dunkers!

1:32:48.208 --> 1:32:51.916
