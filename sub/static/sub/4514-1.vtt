BARTENDER: Last orders, please.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.980
- LIZ: Shaun.
- Yeah?

01:05.480 --> 01:08.730
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, totally.

01:10.150 --> 01:12.690
I know he's your best friend,
but you do live with him.

01:12.780 --> 01:14.150
I know.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.410
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.

01:18.490 --> 01:20.070
It's all right.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.490
- It'd just be nice if we could...
- Fuck.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.210
- ... spend a bit more time together.
- Bollocks.

01:27.290 --> 01:30.330
- Just the two of us.
- Cock it.

01:30.420 --> 01:33.210
It's just with Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out,

01:33.300 --> 01:35.300
and then that only exacerbates things.

01:35.380 --> 01:39.640
- What do you mean?
- Well, you guys hardly get on, do you?

01:39.720 --> 01:44.100
- No, what does "exacerbate" mean?
- It means to make things worse.

01:44.180 --> 01:45.680
Right, right.

01:46.190 --> 01:49.810
Well, I mean, it's not that
I don't like David and Di, you know.

01:49.900 --> 01:53.400
- Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
- BOTH: It's all right.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.940
And it's not that I don't want to spend time
with you, 'cause I do.

01:56.030 --> 01:59.030
It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends.

01:59.110 --> 02:02.530
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.710
- Anybody?
- BOTH: No, thank you.

02:09.420 --> 02:13.800
I know friends are important to Shaun,

02:13.880 --> 02:17.090
but you do actually have to set some
quality time aside for yourselves.

02:17.170 --> 02:21.010
Yeah, I mean Daffs is always taking me
to see these listed buildings,

02:21.090 --> 02:23.760
and, you know,
I'm always dragging him to the theater.

02:23.850 --> 02:25.010
I'm not so hot on theater.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.730
DIANNE: Well, how about a nice meal?
It's your anniversary soon, isn't it?

02:27.810 --> 02:31.440
- It was last week.
- Oh. Did you do anything special?

02:31.520 --> 02:33.900
- We came here.
- ED: Shaun. Hog lumps.

02:35.110 --> 02:38.820
Shaun, what I'm trying to say is
I need something more,

02:38.900 --> 02:41.030
more than spending every night
in the Winchester.

02:41.110 --> 02:43.530
I want to get out there
and do more interesting stuff.

02:43.620 --> 02:47.620
I want to live a little.
I want you to want to want to do it, too.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.670
Listen to me.
I'm beginning to sound like your mum.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.170
Not that I'd know what she sounds like.

02:53.250 --> 02:56.090
- You still haven't met his mum?
- Not yet.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.710
Don't you get along with your mum, Shaun?

02:57.800 --> 02:59.470
No. It's not that I don't get on with her...

02:59.550 --> 03:02.510
- Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?
- No, I love my mum.

03:02.590 --> 03:04.260
- I love his mum.
- SHAUN: Ed!

03:04.350 --> 03:06.430
- She's like butter.
- Ed!

03:06.520 --> 03:07.520
- BOTH: Shaun!
- Guys.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.770
- Shaun.
- Liz.

03:08.850 --> 03:12.350
Look, I understand what you're trying
to say, okay, and I agree.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.190
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.

03:15.270 --> 03:18.730
All right, I'll book a restaurant, you know,
the place that does all the fish.

03:18.820 --> 03:23.110
Just the two of us.
Things will change, I promise.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.620
Really, Shaun?

03:27.450 --> 03:28.830
BARTENDER: Time, gentlemen.

03:28.910 --> 03:31.040
<i>MAN ON JUKEBOX:

<i>MALE VOICE ON TV:

04:42.740 --> 04:44.570
Haven't you got work?

04:44.860 --> 04:47.030
<i>MALE VOICE ON TV:
Player two has left the game.</i>

05:00.050 --> 05:02.760
You do know the front door
was open again last night.

05:06.590 --> 05:08.640
- I'm not saying it was you.
- I know, man.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.890
- I'm saying it was Ed.
- Right.

05:11.930 --> 05:13.850
I can't live like this.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.640
I mean, just look at the state of it.

05:16.730 --> 05:18.730
- We're not students anymore.
- Pete, just...

05:18.810 --> 05:20.980
I mean, it's not like he even brings
any real money into the house.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.900
- Well, he brings a bit.
- What, dealing drugs?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.650
Oh, he sells a bit of weed
every now and again, you know.

05:26.740 --> 05:27.910
You've sold puff.

05:27.990 --> 05:30.780
Yeah, once. At college. To you.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.700
Well, look, I've known him
since primary school, you know.

05:33.790 --> 05:35.410
I like having him around, he's a laugh.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.830
What, because he can impersonate
an orangutan? Fuck-a-doodle-doo.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.250
Oh, leave him alone.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.960
All right, I admit
he can be pretty funny on occasion.

05:44.050 --> 05:46.090
Like that time we stayed up all night
drinking Apple Schnapps

05:46.170 --> 05:47.220
and playing Tekken 2.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.590
Oh, yeah.

05:50.260 --> 05:51.350
When was that?

05:51.430 --> 05:54.600
That was five years ago.
When's he going home?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.770
Hey, man, listen... Top left.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.310
- I was gonna say... Reload.
- I'm on it.

06:02.770 --> 06:05.070
- Since... Nice shot.
- Thanks.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.820
Two seconds.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.870
<i>- You all right, Noodle?
- Hello, mate, got anything?</i>

06:11.950 --> 06:14.330
<i>- No, man.
- But Eball says you was holding.</i>

06:14.410 --> 06:17.000
<i>- I ain't got nothing.
- What? You ain't got nothing at all?</i>

06:17.080 --> 06:20.290
ED: I've only got a Henry meself.
All right, laters.

06:22.540 --> 06:24.090
- Listen...
- PETE: Ed,

06:24.800 --> 06:26.960
since you're not working at the moment,

06:27.050 --> 06:29.590
- could you please clean up a bit?
- ED: Yep.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.800
And if you play the answer machine,

06:30.890 --> 06:33.350
could you take down everyone's messages,
not just your own?

06:33.430 --> 06:34.640
Yep.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.560
It's not that taxing, is it?

06:36.640 --> 06:39.020
Writing something on a little scrap
of paper?

06:39.100 --> 06:41.100
- Nope.
- Right.

06:45.650 --> 06:48.490
- PETE: Dom, hi...
- Come on, it was pretty funny.

06:49.030 --> 06:51.660
- Will you do what he said though?
- I ain't doing nothing for him.

06:51.740 --> 06:53.700
Well, do it for me, then.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.750
I'm sorry, Shaun.

06:58.620 --> 07:02.330
- It's all right.
- No, no. I'm sorry, Shaun.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.750
Oh!

07:07.300 --> 07:09.260
Oh, my God, that's rotten.

07:09.340 --> 07:10.590
I'll stop doing them
when you stop laughing.

07:11.760 --> 07:12.890
I am not laughing, I'm going.

07:12.970 --> 07:14.760
- Get that.
- You get it.

07:17.850 --> 07:19.270
<i>LIZ: Hello, Shaun, it's me.</i>

07:19.350 --> 07:21.100

07:21.190 --> 07:23.850

07:30.110 --> 07:32.280
Hey! You're dead.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.290
- Spare some change, please, mister?
- Yeah.

07:46.670 --> 07:48.710

Hello, my friend. No beer today?

08:36.300 --> 08:38.430
No, it's a bit early for me.

08:49.190 --> 08:53.110
SHAUN: Gather round, everyone.
Gather round, please.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.240
Gather round.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.950
Now, as well as Mr. Sloman being off today,

08:57.030 --> 09:00.910
I'm afraid Ash is feeling a little bit
under the weather.

09:00.990 --> 09:04.500
- So, I will be taking charge, as the...
- Oldest.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.870
Senior Staff Member.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.250
So, if we can all just pull together,
I know that...

09:10.800 --> 09:12.800
Hello? Hello, mate.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.670
- Noel...
- I was totally munted last night.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.760
Yeah, I spoke to him. He's only got Henry.

<i>- All right, mate. Laters.

09:31.650 --> 09:33.980

- Thank you.

09:35.150 --> 09:40.240
As Mr. Sloman always says, "There's
no 'I' in team but there is an 'I' in pie.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.450
"In... There's an 'I' in meat pie."

09:42.540 --> 09:44.870
The anagram of "meat" is "team."
I don't know what he's talking about.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.250
Look, that's it. And, Noel, phones off, yeah?
It's not a social gathering.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.210
All right, keep your hair on, Grandad.

09:50.290 --> 09:54.840
Hey, hey, whoa. I'm 29 for Christ's sakes.
How old are you? 20? 21?

09:54.920 --> 09:57.720
- Seventeen.
- Hey, well...

09:58.970 --> 10:00.840
Look, I know you don't wanna
be here forever.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.100
I got things I wanna do with my life.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.180
When?

10:06.390 --> 10:07.980
You got red on you.

10:10.190 --> 10:11.810
NOEL: Hello, mate.

10:12.270 --> 10:15.900
This one comes with a basic, sort of,
digital package.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.860
You've got your lifestyle channels there,
a bit of Trisha.

10:20.740 --> 10:23.910
You've got entertainment...
I don't know what that is.

10:23.990 --> 10:29.750
News. All the basic news channels.

He's not my dad, he's my stepdad.

about tomorrow.

10:55.730 --> 10:58.320
- No.
- Your bi-monthly visit.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.650
No, I haven't forgotten.

10:59.740 --> 11:03.320
Perhaps you could bring the flowers you
forgot to bring Barbara on Mother's Day.

11:03.410 --> 11:04.450
I was gonna.

11:04.530 --> 11:07.580
And not a cheap posy
from a garage forecourt.

this wasn't a social gathering?

11:28.770 --> 11:29.890
What?

11:29.980 --> 11:32.190
How comes you're allowed to speak
to your dad?

11:32.270 --> 11:35.730
A, he's not my dad, okay? He's my stepdad.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.860
And B, it was an emergency.

11:38.940 --> 11:41.700
What, like buying your mum some flowers?

11:41.780 --> 11:43.530
Noel, no matter what you might think, okay,

11:43.620 --> 11:47.030
I do not find it difficult to keep my work
and my social life separate.

- Surviving.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.130
So, are you living round here?

13:25.220 --> 13:28.300
- Um, yeah, are you?
- Yeah, I've just bought a place, actually.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.470
- Bought?
- I know, bit grown up, eh?

13:31.560 --> 13:33.720

It's three years ago last week, actually.

13:41.190 --> 13:42.570
Did you do anything special?

13:42.650 --> 13:44.650
Well, we're going out for a meal tonight,
actually.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.400
Oh, anywhere nice?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.240
Yeah.

- Are you gonna thank me, then?
- For what?

14:01.790 --> 14:03.170
Tidying up.

14:03.250 --> 14:06.590
- Well, it doesn't look that tidy.
- Well, I had a few beers when I finished.

14:11.930 --> 14:14.470
Well, your mum rang about going round
tomorrow night.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.480
And then Liz rang about the two of you
eating out tonight.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.270

14:21.770 --> 14:23.190

14:23.270 --> 14:25.280
I know this is really short notice
and everything,

14:25.360 --> 14:28.860
but could you possibly do me a table
for two for tonight at about 8:00?

Where are we gonna go?

14:40.540 --> 14:43.380
- The Winchester.
- Don't be stupid! They don't do food.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.050
There's a Breville out back.
John'll do you a toastie.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.380
Ed, this is serious!

14:47.800 --> 14:49.300
<i>- Hello.
- LIZ: Hello, it's me.</i>

14:49.380 --> 14:52.430
<i>- Hello.
- So, what's the plan, then?</i>

14:54.220 --> 14:57.100
Yeah, there's been a bit of a mix-up
with the table, babe.

14:57.180 --> 14:59.350
<i>What do you mean?</i>

14:59.440 --> 15:01.140
They're... They're full up.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.860
<i>But I thought you said it was all okay!</i>

15:03.940 --> 15:05.150
Yeah.

15:05.940 --> 15:08.400
<i>You didn't book it, did you, Shaun?</i>

15:08.490 --> 15:11.820
<i>- No.
- So, what is the plan, then?</i>

15:16.370 --> 15:17.740
The Winchester?

15:23.420 --> 15:24.590
<i>DIANNE ON SPEAKER: Hello.</i>

15:24.670 --> 15:25.840
Dianne, can you let me in, please?

15:25.920 --> 15:27.960
<i>I'm not sure this is the best time, Shaun.</i>

15:28.050 --> 15:29.090
Oh, come on.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.470
<i>DAVID: Lizzie doesn't want
to see you, Shaun. Go away.</i>

15:31.550 --> 15:35.640
<i>- Just open the door!
- She doesn't want to see you, Shaun.</i>

15:35.720 --> 15:37.100
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to go...

15:37.180 --> 15:40.350
Do you want me to climb up the wall,
come through the window? 'Cause I will.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.560
<i>DAVID: You're not coming in.</i>

15:41.640 --> 15:45.060
<i>- I... All right. See you in a minute.
- Don't...</i>

15:57.540 --> 15:58.870
<i>SHAUN: Hi, it's me again.</i>

15:59.830 --> 16:02.120
Liz, can we just talk about this?
You know, let's go out.

16:02.210 --> 16:04.460
- What, to the Winchester?
- Well... Do you want to?

16:04.540 --> 16:07.340
- LIZ: No, I don't fucking want to!
- Okay. I just thought, you know...

16:07.420 --> 16:09.130
It's not the only place in the world, Shaun!

16:09.210 --> 16:12.880
Well, we could go to The Shepherd's, then,
they do Thai in there now.

16:12.970 --> 16:14.340
I'm going out with David and Di.

16:14.430 --> 16:16.640
SHAUN: Well, let's all go together.
LIZ: What, you hang out with my friends?

16:16.720 --> 16:19.470
- Sorry, a failed actress and a twat?
- SHAUN: Well, that's harsh.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.930
LIZ: Your words.
SHAUN: I did not call Dianne a failed actress.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.350
Let's just go out, you know.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.980
Let's just go out somewhere
and have a laugh.

16:26.060 --> 16:27.650
Things'll be fine, I promise.

16:27.730 --> 16:29.190
You promised you'd stop smoking
when I did.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.150
- What...
- You promised you'd go back to the gym!

16:31.240 --> 16:32.820
- I...
- You promised you'd try drinking red wine

16:32.900 --> 16:33.860
- instead of beer!
- Well...

16:33.950 --> 16:35.200
You promised you'd come on holiday
with me.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.120
- We went to Greece, didn't we?
- We met in Greece.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.830
- At a rave.
- It's just not the same.

16:40.910 --> 16:43.750
- You promised things would change.
- You promised you'd get us free cable.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.500
- I'm working on that.
- Okay.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.500
Well, I can give up smoking.
I can give up whenever I want.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.670
Look, see. Don't need them.

16:50.630 --> 16:54.260
- What was the next one?
- It's not enough, Shaun.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.850
Basically, I'd say your nine lives
are up, Shaun.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.730
Get fucked, four-eyes!

17:06.810 --> 17:09.440
Why don't you go out with her,
you love her so much?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.480
What do you mean by that?

17:12.570 --> 17:17.240
<i>MALE REPORTER ON TV: The devastation
really is extensive. It really is a total mess.</i>

17:17.320 --> 17:19.780
I don't know what he meant by that.

17:23.330 --> 17:24.960
SHAUN: Got you these.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.710
To a wonderful mum?

17:33.800 --> 17:36.300
Oh! Yeah.

17:36.380 --> 17:40.390
Yeah, that's because
I thought it would be funny

17:40.470 --> 17:43.060
because of what you said last night
about me, you know,

17:43.140 --> 17:45.560
you don't wanna be my mum and that,
and it's just a little joke.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.980
It's something I just thought of,
spur of the moment.

17:50.310 --> 17:52.650
- They're for your mum, aren't they?
- Yeah.

17:52.730 --> 17:54.070
Smooth.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.080
Look, if I don't do something,

18:04.160 --> 18:06.750
I'm gonna end up in that pub, every night,
for the rest of my life,

18:06.830 --> 18:08.670
like those other sad old fuckers,
drinking myself to death,

18:08.750 --> 18:11.130
wondering what the hell happened.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.920
What do you mean, "Do something"?

18:48.500 --> 18:50.120
Fuck her!

18:50.210 --> 18:54.750
You got your pint. You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?

18:56.420 --> 18:59.340
Oh. Your favorite monkey?

19:00.760 --> 19:02.390
Shall I do Clyde?

19:14.770 --> 19:17.070
See, I knew you'd get over her.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.750
- Who the hell put this on?
- It's on random.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.250
Ah, for fuck's sake. John, yes, please, mate.

19:40.010 --> 19:42.260
You know what we should do tomorrow?

19:42.340 --> 19:45.850
Keep drinking.
We'll have a Bloody Mary first thing.

19:45.930 --> 19:48.810
Have a bite at the King's Head,
couple at The Little Princess,

19:48.890 --> 19:52.480
we'll stagger back here and bang,
we're back at the bar for shots.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.310
How's that for a slice of fried gold?

19:54.400 --> 19:56.820
- No.
- Come on, man.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.690
Talk to me.

20:00.780 --> 20:04.450
She said if she stayed with me,
she'd end up coming in here, every night,

20:04.530 --> 20:08.200
for the rest of her life, like these
sad old fuckers, drinking herself to death,

20:08.290 --> 20:10.120
wondering what the hell happened.

20:10.200 --> 20:14.170
That is harsh.
These are rich, interesting characters.

20:14.250 --> 20:15.500
Like who?

20:18.460 --> 20:24.090
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.
He's a bigamist.

20:24.180 --> 20:27.390
Strangled his first wife
with a draught excluder.

20:27.470 --> 20:29.850
And he invented the mobile disco.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.680
Well, what about her, then?

20:33.980 --> 20:35.940
Cockacidal maniac.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.280
She's an ex-porn star. She's done it all.

20:40.360 --> 20:44.030
They say she starred
in the world's first interracial hardcore loop.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.780
<i>Café au Lait.</i>

20:47.070 --> 20:48.370
<i>Pour vous.</i>

20:50.490 --> 20:53.460
Yeah. What about John, then?

20:53.540 --> 20:54.830
ED: He's North London Mafia.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.960
ED: It's true, Big Al says so.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.760
Yeah, well, Big Al also says
dogs can't look up.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.510
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanor.

21:05.590 --> 21:08.430
Bernie, the trophy wife. He's connected.

21:08.510 --> 21:10.100
Why do you think
there's a rifle above the bar?

21:10.180 --> 21:12.140
SHAUN: 'Cause the pub's called
the Winchester.

21:12.220 --> 21:13.520
Exactly.

21:14.350 --> 21:16.600
See, you don't need Liz to have a good time.

21:16.690 --> 21:18.270
Oh, Ed, don't, man.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.860
No. Look at me.
Can I just say one more thing?

21:22.940 --> 21:26.030
I'm not gonna say, you know,
"There's plenty more fish in the sea."

21:26.110 --> 21:28.370
I'm not gonna say,
"If you love her let her go."

21:28.450 --> 21:30.740
And I'm not gonna bombard you
with clichés.

21:30.830 --> 21:32.950
But what I will say is this,

21:34.660 --> 21:35.750
"It's not the end of the world."

21:42.000 --> 21:43.840
Sorry, we're closed.

21:47.300 --> 21:48.300
Pisshead.

- He should say "Bass."

22:39.770 --> 22:42.190
Or "Freeze."

22:42.270 --> 22:43.610
What a tit.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.870
You wanna dance?

23:02.790 --> 23:04.960
Hey, don't scratch it! Wait.

23:07.130 --> 23:08.760
That was the second album I ever bought!

23:08.840 --> 23:11.220
It's 4:00 in the fucking morning!

23:11.300 --> 23:14.180
- It's Saturday!
- No, it's not. It's fucking Sunday,

23:14.260 --> 23:16.470
and I've got to go to fucking work
in four fucking hours,

23:16.560 --> 23:20.060
because every other fucker
in my fucking department is fucking ill!

23:20.140 --> 23:23.400
Now can you see why I'm so fucking angry?

23:23.480 --> 23:25.150
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hey.

23:25.230 --> 23:27.570
Pete, look, I'm... You know, I'm sorry.

23:27.650 --> 23:31.820
We just... We've had a couple of drinks.
We split up with Liz tonight.

23:33.450 --> 23:35.450
Just keep it down, yeah?

23:36.580 --> 23:37.790
Prick.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.160
- PETE: What was that?
- Nothing.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.420
No, no, no, come on, stop it. We're friends!

23:43.500 --> 23:45.630
He's not my friend. He's a fucking idiot!

23:45.710 --> 23:46.800
What's that supposed to mean?

23:46.880 --> 23:49.090
It means, why don't you fuck off?

23:49.170 --> 23:52.760
You wanna live like an animal,
go and live in the shed, you thick fuck!

23:52.840 --> 23:56.220
- Oh, leave him alone!
- Stop defending him, Shaun!

23:56.310 --> 23:58.060
All he ever does is hold you back!

23:58.140 --> 23:59.770
Or does it make your life easier
having someone around

23:59.850 --> 24:02.390
who's more of a loser than you?

24:02.480 --> 24:05.690
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what I mean.

24:05.770 --> 24:08.530
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?

24:09.530 --> 24:12.610
Sort your fucking life out, mate!

24:12.700 --> 24:14.950
What's up with your hand, man?

24:16.030 --> 24:18.990
- I got mugged on the way home from work.
- By who?

24:19.080 --> 24:21.160
I don't know, some crackheads
or something. One of them bit me.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.460
Why did they bite you?

24:22.540 --> 24:25.420
I don't know. I didn't stop to ask them!

24:25.500 --> 24:30.630
Now, I've got a splitting headache
and your stupid hip-hop isn't helping.

24:30.710 --> 24:33.090
And the front door is open again!

24:34.590 --> 24:38.850
It's not Hip-Hop. It's Electro. Prick.

24:38.930 --> 24:41.270
Next time I see him, he's dead.

24:52.740 --> 24:54.650
<i>LIZ: Hello, Shaun, it's me.</i>

24:54.740 --> 24:56.320
<i>Look, I'm gonna be a bit tied up today,</i>

24:56.410 --> 24:59.120
<i>so when you book the table,

25:13.510 --> 25:15.340
<i>Only, we can't wait to meet her finally,</i>

25:15.430 --> 25:20.850
<i>and also, I was wondering
if she wanted anything special for lunch.</i>

25:20.930 --> 25:23.180
<i>'Cause these days lots of people
don't eat meat.</i>

25:39.240 --> 25:42.660
- Do you want anything from the shop?
- Cornetto.

26:51.690 --> 26:54.020
Nelson, have you got any papers?

26:55.730 --> 27:00.490
Nelson? I haven't even...
I owe you about fifteen p.

27:33.900 --> 27:35.360
Oh, dear.

27:38.030 --> 27:39.610
Sorry, I haven't got any change.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.530
I didn't even have enough

- I'm so sorry, Philip.
- Why?

44:02.050 --> 44:03.390
What have you done now?

44:03.470 --> 44:06.810
- Nothing.
- What have you got there? Flowers, I hope.

44:06.890 --> 44:10.770
- No, it's... Cricket bat.
- Oh, is that for the jumble, Shaun?

44:10.850 --> 44:12.020
No. Yes.

44:12.100 --> 44:15.980
There's a box of your toys upstairs.
I was going to give them to the jumble.

44:16.070 --> 44:18.030
I took them all to the tip, Barbara.

44:18.110 --> 44:20.570
- Oh, what?
- Shaun wants to take us somewhere.

44:20.650 --> 44:22.490
Don't be silly. I'm not going anywhere.

44:22.570 --> 44:23.780
Well, maybe you should stay here.

44:23.870 --> 44:25.280
You know, wait for the doctor,
and I'll take Mum.

44:25.370 --> 44:28.620
- But you said the doctor wasn't coming.
- You didn't call the doctor, did you?

44:28.700 --> 44:30.330
Well, I thought we ought to be
on the safe side.

44:30.410 --> 44:31.960
I'm quite all right, Barbara.

44:32.040 --> 44:34.500
- I ran it under a cold tap.
- I really think...

44:34.580 --> 44:36.960
We had our jabs
when we went to the Isle of Wight.

44:37.050 --> 44:38.880
- But, Philip...
- It's a lot of overblown nonsense.

44:40.050 --> 44:41.510
A lot of drug nuts running wild.

44:41.590 --> 44:44.090
Still, I should get Mum away, you know,
just 'cause, in case they come back.

44:44.180 --> 44:45.760
I'm not going anywhere without Philip.

44:45.850 --> 44:49.060
Mum, look, how about that tea?

44:50.390 --> 44:54.560
Mum? How much do you love Philip?

44:54.650 --> 44:55.730
Two sugars, is it?

44:55.810 --> 44:57.900
I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.

44:57.980 --> 44:59.360
Oh, yes.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.530
Will you cut me some bread, love?

45:01.610 --> 45:03.900
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?

45:03.990 --> 45:06.160
Oh, Shaun, do we have to go through
all that again?

45:06.240 --> 45:08.870
Mum, look, what would you say
if I told you that over the years

45:08.950 --> 45:10.370
Philip's been quite unkind to me?

45:10.450 --> 45:12.370
Well, you weren't always the easiest person
to live with.

45:12.460 --> 45:14.250
Mum, he chased me around the garden
with a bit of wood!

45:14.330 --> 45:16.210
Well, you did call him a you-know-what.

45:16.290 --> 45:17.880
- Oh, what, did he tell you that?
- Yes, he did.

45:17.960 --> 45:19.210
- Motherfucker.
- Shaun.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.210
Sorry, Mother, Mum.

45:21.300 --> 45:26.550
Look, Mum, did you know that
on several occasions he touched me?

45:31.970 --> 45:35.060
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have done, sorry.

45:35.140 --> 45:37.520
- Mum, you don't understand, okay...
- No, it's you that doesn't understand.

45:37.610 --> 45:40.110
Philip is my husband
and has been for the last 17 years.

45:40.190 --> 45:42.570
I know you haven't always seen eye-to-eye,

45:42.650 --> 45:46.240
but I would, at least,
expect you to respect my feelings.

45:46.320 --> 45:47.860
You must be more adult about these things.

45:47.950 --> 45:52.080
Yeah, come on, Shaun.

45:52.160 --> 45:59.040
There comes a time
when you just got to be a man.

46:07.510 --> 46:10.600
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.680
- Hello, Edward.
- Hi, Barbara.

46:12.770 --> 46:15.430
- BARBARA: My, how you've grown.
- Yeah, you better believe it.

46:15.520 --> 46:17.560
What happened? Why is he coming?

46:17.650 --> 46:19.020
It wasn't as easy as all that.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.900
- ED: God's sake.
- So, we're following you, are we?

46:20.980 --> 46:24.360
No, it's probably best if we...
Where's the car?

46:26.900 --> 46:30.160
- I pranged it.
- You were parked!

46:30.240 --> 46:31.450
Yeah.

46:32.370 --> 46:34.540
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.

46:36.540 --> 46:38.330
- Philip...
- What?

46:38.420 --> 46:39.880
Look out!

46:42.090 --> 46:43.420
PHILIP: Christ!

46:44.960 --> 46:46.130
ED: Jesus!

46:51.600 --> 46:53.890
- Philip, give me the car keys!
- You're not driving that car.

46:53.970 --> 46:57.020
Philip! Give me the car keys!

46:57.100 --> 46:59.690
- Ed, get Mum in the car.
- I'm on it.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.650
- SHAUN: Come on.
- No, don't worry about me.

47:02.730 --> 47:04.400
Worry about your mother.

47:04.860 --> 47:08.110
- Ed, maybe I should drive.
- Man, I've adjusted the seat now.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.610
All right, well, just, you know, be careful!

47:21.080 --> 47:24.210
Can you please turn that noise down?

47:24.920 --> 47:28.550
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?

47:28.630 --> 47:31.720
I'd be fine,
if it weren't for that bloody racket!

47:31.800 --> 47:34.510
- It is a bit loud.
- Sorry, Barbara.

47:36.600 --> 47:39.390
You do realize this is
a 20 mile an hour zone.

47:39.480 --> 47:40.770
Oh, yeah.

47:44.110 --> 47:45.110
Here.

47:45.190 --> 47:48.570
Okay, Mum, listen,
this isn't gonna take a second, all right?

47:50.280 --> 47:51.780
Philip, have you still got the child locks on?

47:51.860 --> 47:53.620
Safety first, Shaun.

47:54.740 --> 47:56.240
You can't...

47:58.290 --> 48:01.290
Hey, man, watch the leather.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.460
Listen, okay, keep moving.
If there's any problems...

48:05.550 --> 48:07.420
Yeah, yeah, I'll do the honks.

48:32.700 --> 48:33.950
<i>DIANNE ON SPEAKER: Hello?</i>

48:36.450 --> 48:37.950
Hello?

49:00.520 --> 49:02.180
Guys, can you let me in, please?

49:02.270 --> 49:05.100
- What are you doing?
- I've come to get you.

49:18.120 --> 49:19.490
Sorry, what are you doing?

49:19.580 --> 49:20.790
I've come to take you somewhere safe.

49:20.870 --> 49:24.040
- We were perfectly safe before you arrived.
- You don't know that.

49:24.120 --> 49:26.370
Well, there was two of them out there
a minute ago. How many are there now?

49:27.540 --> 49:28.920
- Lots.
- Lots!

49:29.000 --> 49:31.800
Look, believe me, it only takes one of them
to know you're in here.

49:31.880 --> 49:34.010
Listen, I tried calling, I really did,
but I couldn't get through.

49:34.090 --> 49:36.510
- I had to come up with a plan.
- Oh, you made a plan.

49:36.590 --> 49:39.390
Look, I don't care what the telly says,
all right, we have to get out of here.

49:39.470 --> 49:41.810
If we don't, they'll come up here
and they'll tear us to pieces.

49:41.890 --> 49:44.480
And that is really gonna exacerbate things
for all of us.

49:44.560 --> 49:46.310
- Shaun...
- Look, Liz,

49:46.400 --> 49:48.310
this is not about you and me, all right?

49:48.400 --> 49:49.730
This is about survival.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.730
We need to be somewhere more secure,
somewhere on the ground,

49:51.820 --> 49:53.690
somewhere we can stay alive.

49:53.780 --> 49:55.900
- DIANNE: We're with you, Shaun.
- What?

49:55.990 --> 49:57.360
We're with you.

49:57.450 --> 49:58.910
I'm not going out there.

49:58.990 --> 50:01.080
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces,

50:01.160 --> 50:03.500
and I'm sure if you really think about it,
neither do you.

50:03.580 --> 50:06.000
- I'm not going if Liz is not going.
- Of course she's going.

50:06.080 --> 50:08.920
- Well, I'm not staying here by myself.
- You're going, aren't you, Elizabeth?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
- Lizzie?
- Liz?

50:15.880 --> 50:17.760
All right, Flash, what do you have in mind?

50:17.840 --> 50:21.640
Great, okay, I've got a car outside,
but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.

50:21.720 --> 50:23.850
- So, has anyone got transport?
- Yes, yes.

50:23.930 --> 50:26.600
- Great. Where?
- Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.

50:28.100 --> 50:29.100
David?

50:29.190 --> 50:31.940
I don't see the point of owning a car
in London.

50:32.610 --> 50:35.280
Look, okay, just get any blunt objects
together, all right?

50:35.360 --> 50:38.030
If you get cornered, bash them in the head,
that seems to work.

50:38.110 --> 50:40.950
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.

50:41.030 --> 50:45.080
- So, what... What's the plan, then?
- We're going to the Winchester.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.750
Okay? Let's go.

51:07.770 --> 51:10.100
- Come on.
- Where's the car?

51:14.610 --> 51:16.280
What's up, niggaz?

51:21.660 --> 51:24.780
Okay, apologies for the cramped conditions,
everybody, okay? Di, stay on David's lap?

51:24.870 --> 51:26.490
- Okay.
- Philip, hang in there, okay?

51:26.580 --> 51:28.460
- Ed, get there fast, yeah?
- Yeah.

51:28.540 --> 51:30.960
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.330
- Hello.
- Hello.

51:39.050 --> 51:40.090
- Ed.
- Shaun.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.840
I know. Ed, be careful.

51:41.930 --> 51:43.390
- Is your dad all right?
- He's not my dad.

51:43.470 --> 51:45.890
- DIANNE: He's bleeding.
- Yeah, I know. Ed, just be careful!

51:45.970 --> 51:48.310
Thought you wanted to get there fast?

51:49.890 --> 51:52.770
I just want to get there in one piece, okay?
And why are we going this way?

51:52.860 --> 51:54.360
Chill out, it's a shortcut.

51:54.440 --> 51:55.860
But that road goes straight
to the Winchester.

51:55.940 --> 51:59.150
- Shaun.
- Look, I know. Liz, please!

51:59.240 --> 52:02.280
I still don't actually understand
why we are going to the Winchester.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.620
Because it's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.

52:04.700 --> 52:06.620
- They know us there.
- What makes it so secure?

52:06.700 --> 52:09.580
Because it's got big heavy doors
and deadbolts. You've been to a lock in.

52:09.660 --> 52:11.120
- Several.
- And there's a rifle above the bar.

52:11.210 --> 52:13.540
- I would think that's deactivated.
- Surely.

52:13.630 --> 52:16.420
It's not. I'm telling you. John's connected.
Big Al says so.

52:16.500 --> 52:18.420
Yeah, well, Big Al also says
dogs can't look up!

52:18.510 --> 52:19.630
- They can't.
- Can't they?

52:19.720 --> 52:21.130
- No, they can't!
- Of course they can!

52:21.220 --> 52:23.970
- Are you sure? I...
- Yes, look, the pub is the right place to go.

52:24.050 --> 52:25.930
Okay? Everything is gonna be fine,
I promise.

52:26.010 --> 52:27.890
- Shaun?
- I turned it off, all right?

52:27.970 --> 52:30.640
- It's not easy.
- What?

52:30.730 --> 52:34.440
- Being a father, it's not easy.
- What?

52:34.520 --> 52:39.360
You were 12 when I met you.
You'd already grown up so much.

52:39.440 --> 52:45.070
I just wanted you to be strong and not
give up because you lost your dad.

52:45.740 --> 52:47.330
Philip, you don't have to explain.

52:47.410 --> 52:51.660
No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.

52:51.750 --> 52:57.500
I always thought you had it in you
to do well.

52:57.590 --> 53:00.590
And you just need motivation.

53:00.670 --> 53:04.260
Somebody to look up to, and...

53:06.100 --> 53:08.140
I thought it could be me.

53:10.100 --> 53:13.730
Would you just take care of your mum?

53:16.480 --> 53:18.360
There's a good boy.

53:21.940 --> 53:24.610
- Ed, can you pull over?
- Two seconds.

53:27.530 --> 53:29.490
- Ed, please pull over.
- What for?

53:29.580 --> 53:31.790
- Ed, just pull over!
- All right.

53:38.460 --> 53:39.540
Whoa, mama!

53:39.630 --> 53:41.050
Christ! What the hell do you think
you're doing?

53:41.130 --> 53:45.630
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.
- Stop telling me to chill out!

53:46.760 --> 53:48.930
And no, for your information,
everybody is not all right.

53:49.010 --> 53:50.720
BARBARA: What's wrong?

53:50.810 --> 53:54.310
- Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.
- Where's he gone?

53:54.390 --> 53:57.560
- Mum, he's dead.
- No, he isn't.

53:59.060 --> 54:01.570
Get out! Get out!

54:01.900 --> 54:04.900
Oh, Jesus! Fuck, fuck.

54:04.990 --> 54:06.490
It won't open! It won't open!

54:06.570 --> 54:09.910
- Ed, get the child locks!
- DIANNE: Come on, quick, come on.

54:09.990 --> 54:11.080
It won't open.

54:13.330 --> 54:14.830
Ed!

54:34.020 --> 54:35.930
- Now what?
- We've got to keep moving.

54:36.020 --> 54:37.770
- How do we get Philip out the car?
- SHAUN: We haven't got time.

54:37.850 --> 54:39.600
- LIZ: What about the blunt objects?
- Do you want to get them?

54:39.690 --> 54:41.900
- Shaun, we can't just leave your dad!
- He's not my dad!

54:41.980 --> 54:44.530
- Oh, Shaun...
- Mum, he was, but he's not anymore!

54:44.610 --> 54:46.610
- I really think we could...
- No, listen to me, Mum, listen.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.570
That's not even your husband in there.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.860
Okay? I know it looks like him,

54:49.950 --> 54:53.280
but there is nothing of the man you loved
in that car now, nothing!

54:56.040 --> 54:57.540
Let's go, shall we?

54:58.330 --> 55:00.710
You're not seriously suggesting we walk!

55:02.840 --> 55:06.880
- Everybody okay back there?
- ED: Oh, yeah, we're having a whale of a time.

55:06.970 --> 55:09.930
Maybe we should all hold hands,
like a crocodile?

55:10.010 --> 55:12.140
Do you have any idea
where we're actually going?

55:12.220 --> 55:14.810
- LIZ: David, come on.
- Sorry.

55:14.890 --> 55:16.980
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally, totally.

55:17.060 --> 55:18.730
Well, are we close?

55:24.900 --> 55:26.570
SHAUN: We're pretty close.

55:27.610 --> 55:29.990
LIZ: Is your mum gonna be okay?
SHAUN: Yeah, I hope so.

55:30.070 --> 55:31.450
Did you manage to get in contact
with your folks?

55:31.530 --> 55:33.660
- They're in Antigua.
- Do you think this is happening there?

55:33.740 --> 55:35.540
I hope not.

55:35.620 --> 55:38.830
Listen, Liz, about last night. You know,
I know loads of things were said, but...

55:38.910 --> 55:40.670
Shaun, you said this wasn't about you
and me.

55:40.750 --> 55:43.330
- No, no, it's not, but, I just...
- You said it was about survival.

55:43.420 --> 55:44.500
Yeah, it is, but what I'm saying is...

55:44.590 --> 55:46.250
You're not doing all this
just to prove something, are you?

55:46.340 --> 55:47.340
No, of course not. I just think...

55:47.420 --> 55:49.920
Because I meant everything I said
last night. Nothing's changed.

55:52.680 --> 55:54.300
Maybe this isn't the best time
to talk about it.

55:54.390 --> 55:56.220
- Okay...
- Oh, my God!

55:57.270 --> 55:58.520
Shaun.

55:59.390 --> 56:01.600
- Yvonne.
- How's it going?

56:02.650 --> 56:04.400
- Surviving.
- Hey, Liz.

56:04.480 --> 56:07.110
- Long time no see.
- Hey, Yvonne.

56:08.740 --> 56:10.860
This is my boyfriend, Declan.

56:10.950 --> 56:16.200
My friends Mark, Maggie,
my mum and my cousin Tom.

56:16.290 --> 56:18.580
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.

56:18.660 --> 56:21.370
- They've split up, actually.
- YVONNE: Oh, really?

56:21.460 --> 56:23.880
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

56:23.960 --> 56:25.710
Well, we should scoot.

56:25.790 --> 56:29.090
- Have you got somewhere you're going?
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.

56:29.170 --> 56:30.470
The pub?

56:32.590 --> 56:35.390
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!

56:41.440 --> 56:42.890
- Hi!
- Hi!

56:42.980 --> 56:44.230
- Hello.
- Hello.

56:44.310 --> 56:45.560
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:45.650 --> 56:47.360
- Hello.
- Hello.

56:47.440 --> 56:48.730
- All right.
- All right.

56:50.860 --> 56:53.070
See, what did I say?
The Winchester's just over there.

56:53.160 --> 56:55.530
- Over where?
- Over there.

56:55.620 --> 56:58.200
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?

56:58.910 --> 57:03.460
What's the matter, David,
never taken a shortcut before?

57:21.020 --> 57:25.770
Shaun, I'm sure Jill and Derek
live round here.

57:39.490 --> 57:43.160
Now, the Winchester is just over that fence,
all right?

57:43.250 --> 57:45.670
So, everyone stay where they are. I'll...

57:45.750 --> 57:48.790
- Hang on, are we all here?
- One, two, three, four, five. Yes.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.630
- There's six of us.
- Oh.

57:52.050 --> 57:53.460
Mum!

57:55.720 --> 57:57.720
I'm coming!

57:57.800 --> 58:00.760
Mum, Mum! Mum, are you okay?
Are you okay?

58:00.850 --> 58:03.680
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.

58:06.060 --> 58:07.190
Shaun?

58:10.980 --> 58:12.730
Are you all right?

58:30.920 --> 58:32.550
What are you doing?

58:35.130 --> 58:36.550
DIANNE: Shaun!

58:40.180 --> 58:41.510
Yes!

58:44.100 --> 58:45.770
No, that's rubbish.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.110
- Oh!
- Yes!

58:57.610 --> 58:59.860
Feel free to step in any time!

58:59.950 --> 59:02.490
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.

59:02.580 --> 59:04.870
- Why?
- I'm so sorry about that.

59:07.080 --> 59:08.460
Right.

59:10.670 --> 59:14.500
Okay, everyone just stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

59:24.010 --> 59:26.140
- Is it clear?
- No.

59:26.230 --> 59:27.980
- LIZ: How many?
- Lots.

59:38.530 --> 59:41.570
Oh, well, that is just great.

59:41.660 --> 59:43.530
There are a fair few of them, yes.

59:43.620 --> 59:46.790
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?

59:46.870 --> 59:49.250
This is hardly constructive, David!

59:49.330 --> 59:50.330
No, Lizzie, this is a waste of time.

59:51.500 --> 59:52.460
We should have stayed at the flat.

59:52.540 --> 59:53.830
- Yeah, why didn't you?
- Because...

59:53.920 --> 59:57.670
- Because...
- Because, because of Captain Wow!

59:57.760 --> 59:58.760
Will you stop it!

59:58.840 --> 1:00:00.930
Yes, we're not gonna get anywhere
by moaning.

1:00:09.810 --> 1:00:14.940
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber. Or not.

1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:18.780
Now, take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.

1:00:18.860 --> 1:00:20.440
Almost like sleepwalking.

1:00:20.530 --> 1:00:24.660
Look at the face, it's vacant
with a hint of sadness.

1:00:24.740 --> 1:00:26.870
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

1:00:26.950 --> 1:00:29.200
Okay, let's try, shall we? Liz.

1:00:32.870 --> 1:00:37.130
Nice, good vocal work. Okay.
Barbara, that's excellent.

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:39.880
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

1:00:40.340 --> 1:00:41.300
Daffs.

1:00:42.510 --> 1:00:43.470
Come on!

1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:48.260
Okay. It's mournful, sorrowful, you're dead,
and you hate it. Go.

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:51.560
Much better. Ed.

1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:54.230
- I'll do it on the night.
- This is the night!

1:00:55.690 --> 1:00:57.650
- What is that?
- What about yours?

1:00:57.730 --> 1:01:00.650
Who died and made you fucking king
of the zombies?

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:02.070
Don't.

1:01:05.620 --> 1:01:08.660
- Yeah, that's pretty good.
- Okay, right.

1:01:08.740 --> 1:01:10.330
Let's all try together, shall we?

1:01:10.410 --> 1:01:13.080
One, two, three.

1:02:06.470 --> 1:02:10.010
Go, go, go, go.

1:02:11.390 --> 1:02:14.180
Shit. Get round me, get round me.

1:02:14.270 --> 1:02:19.020
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.

1:02:19.110 --> 1:02:21.520
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.

1:02:21.610 --> 1:02:23.230
- They know.
- Stay in character, Daffs!

1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:26.400
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.

1:02:26.490 --> 1:02:28.570
- Break the window.
- Don't be stupid, we'll be totally exposed!

1:02:28.660 --> 1:02:30.280
We are totally exposed. Break the window!

1:02:30.370 --> 1:02:32.620
- Is there another way in?
- Well, yeah, there's...

1:02:35.500 --> 1:02:37.000
Two seconds.

1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:38.830
<i>- Hey, Noodle.
- You all right, mate?</i>

1:02:38.920 --> 1:02:40.960
<i>- Yeah, man, I can't really talk now.
- Did you get anything yet?</i>

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:42.420
<i>- I got nothing.
- Really?</i>

1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:44.800
<i>- No, I'm right in the middle of something.
- A bit mentalist, isn't it?</i>

1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:48.090
Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?
Oi! What are you doing?

1:02:48.180 --> 1:02:50.510
What am I doing?
What are you doing, you stupid moron?

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:52.760
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!

1:02:52.850 --> 1:02:54.850
Fuck fucking off!

1:02:54.930 --> 1:02:57.230
- LIZ: Shaun...
- I've spent an entire life... Look at me.

1:02:57.310 --> 1:02:59.520
I've spent my entire life
sticking my neck out for you,

1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:01.310
and all you ever do is fuck things up!

1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:03.110
Fuck things up and make me look stupid!

1:03:03.190 --> 1:03:05.940
Well, I'm not gonna let you do it anymore.
Not today.

1:03:06.030 --> 1:03:07.280
LIZ: Shaun...

1:03:08.860 --> 1:03:09.910
Oh.

1:03:17.660 --> 1:03:21.290
- You were saying about another way in?
- Yeah, there's a...

1:03:22.710 --> 1:03:24.500
What are you doing?

1:03:25.420 --> 1:03:26.460
No!

1:03:28.050 --> 1:03:29.970
- Get inside!
- No, they'll follow us!

1:03:30.050 --> 1:03:31.140
- What?
- They'll follow us.

1:03:31.220 --> 1:03:32.680
Just keep up the act,
I'm gonna have to do something.

1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:34.260
What do you mean, "Do something"?

1:03:34.350 --> 1:03:36.470
Hello, hello, over here, over here!

1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:41.060
Come on, come on, that's it, yeah, come on,
come on, that's it, over here!

1:03:41.150 --> 1:03:43.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, over here!
Yeah, come on!

1:03:43.610 --> 1:03:46.150
Oh, bollocks.
Okay, wait till I've gone, then get inside!

1:03:46.230 --> 1:03:47.230
- Gone where?
- Gone where?

1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:48.690
I won't be long, I promise.

1:03:48.780 --> 1:03:53.990
Come on, you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go!
Follow me. Come on, let's go!

1:03:54.410 --> 1:03:58.660
Come on, this way, this way, that's it,
come on! Come on. This way, follow me.

1:03:58.750 --> 1:04:00.960
Come on, follow me. Come on!

1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:04.210
Come and get it! It's a running buffet!

1:04:04.290 --> 1:04:06.340
All you can eat!

1:04:06.710 --> 1:04:08.460
Shall we go in, then?

1:04:16.930 --> 1:04:20.310
- Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
- I think they're for me.

1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:43.210
- He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
- Seventeen.

1:04:43.290 --> 1:04:46.750
Either way, we need to think about
blocking up this window here.

1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:48.380
We're totally exposed.

1:04:48.460 --> 1:04:52.130
- How will Shaun get back in?
- I'm sure he'll knock.

1:04:53.970 --> 1:04:56.220
Oh, for goodness sake,
let's get some lights on here.

1:04:56.300 --> 1:04:57.680
David, wait!

1:04:58.470 --> 1:05:00.720
- Power's off.
- That's a good thing.

1:05:00.810 --> 1:05:03.270
We don't want to advertise our whereabouts
more than we already have.

1:05:03.350 --> 1:05:05.980
- No, of course not.
- Do we, David?

1:05:06.650 --> 1:05:10.440
No, of course not, Lizzie.
I'm just being proactive.

1:05:10.940 --> 1:05:13.150
There's no lights, there's no power.
Where are the owners?

1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:15.200
And there's that
bloody great hole in the window.

1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:17.660
- You did that, you twat!
- Somebody had to do something!

1:05:17.740 --> 1:05:20.620
I don't know if you noticed back there,
but we were in a spot of bother.

1:05:20.700 --> 1:05:22.290
Somebody has to take control
of the situation,

1:05:22.370 --> 1:05:27.000
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

1:05:27.090 --> 1:05:30.090
then perhaps I should.

1:05:30.710 --> 1:05:32.420
Will Shaun be gone long?

1:05:32.510 --> 1:05:34.800
- LIZ: He'll be back soon.
- How can you know that?

1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:36.550
I don't think he'd leave us, Daffs.

1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:39.510
Wouldn't he?
Lizzie, how can you put your faith in a man

1:05:39.600 --> 1:05:42.850
you spectacularly binned
for being unreliable?

1:05:42.930 --> 1:05:44.810
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot

1:05:44.890 --> 1:05:46.980
and an impenetrable fortress
are the same thing.

1:05:47.060 --> 1:05:50.860
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?

1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:52.690
I could get a round in.

1:05:52.780 --> 1:05:55.610
Look, let's just keep quiet
and wait for Shaun.

1:05:55.700 --> 1:05:57.530
We can barricade the window
when he gets back.

1:05:57.620 --> 1:06:00.410
What then? How long? Days? Weeks?
A month?

1:06:00.490 --> 1:06:01.950
What about food?
What are we going to eat?

1:06:02.040 --> 1:06:04.080
- Toasties!
- Yeah, there's a Breville out back.

1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:06.000
Oh, great, then! Saved by nibbles!

1:06:06.080 --> 1:06:08.710
That must be why Shaun took us here
before he buggered off.

1:06:08.790 --> 1:06:12.960
- He's coming back!
- Why? Because he promised?

1:06:13.050 --> 1:06:15.630
And even if he does, do you think
his master plan's going to extend

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:18.430
to anything more than sitting
and eating peanuts in the dark?

1:06:18.510 --> 1:06:21.180
What, is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's gonna be okay?

1:06:21.260 --> 1:06:23.890
I don't know, David!

1:06:24.390 --> 1:06:25.930
I don't know any more than you do.

1:06:26.020 --> 1:06:30.860
But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it!

1:06:32.400 --> 1:06:35.320
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
- Right you are.

1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:37.150
Think I'll have a drink, too, actually.

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.160
- Would you like a drink, Barbara?
- Hello.

1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:41.450
Right, great, fuck it.
That's what we'll do, that's what we'll do.

1:06:41.530 --> 1:06:44.160
We'll all have a party. How about that?
We all get completely smashed.

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:48.170
Oh, look, we've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars...

1:06:48.250 --> 1:06:49.830
- David!
- We got Twiglets.

1:06:49.920 --> 1:06:52.090
Oh, look, Hog Lumps.

1:06:57.260 --> 1:07:00.760
- Pickle.
- Hello, Mum. You all right?

1:07:00.850 --> 1:07:02.510
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:04.310
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- We haven't seen them.

1:07:04.390 --> 1:07:06.140
- Check upstairs?
- I think it's locked.

1:07:06.230 --> 1:07:09.650
- What's the phone situation?
- Dead. Same as the power.

1:07:09.730 --> 1:07:11.690
SHAUN: Okay.

1:07:11.770 --> 1:07:13.690
Nice of you to join us.

1:07:14.070 --> 1:07:16.860
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't I?

1:07:22.330 --> 1:07:24.790
How did you lose them?

1:07:26.790 --> 1:07:30.330
I just gave them the slip. Wasn't difficult.
They're not all that.

1:07:30.630 --> 1:07:32.170
Well, how did you get in?

1:07:32.250 --> 1:07:33.880
There is a back door, David.

1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:36.050
I tried to tell you
before you went and smashed the window.

1:07:36.130 --> 1:07:39.550
Well, I wasn't the one who was blowing
our cover by having a tiff with my boyfriend.

1:07:39.630 --> 1:07:41.050
He's not my boyfriend.

1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:43.550
Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.

1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:44.970
Thanks, babe.

1:07:46.770 --> 1:07:48.770
So, what's the plan, then?

1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:54.270
Would anyone like a peanut?

1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:05.780
Why don't you do your Clyde?

1:08:05.870 --> 1:08:08.620
<i>Oh, come... Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?</i>

1:08:08.710 --> 1:08:11.370
Ed does the most amazing impression
of the orangutan.

1:08:11.460 --> 1:08:14.250
- No, it's not.
- It is. Come on. Do it.

1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:16.380
- No, no.
- But it's brilliant. Come on, just do it.

1:08:16.460 --> 1:08:17.590
Do it, it'll work. Come on, just do it.

1:08:17.670 --> 1:08:19.090
You've built it up too much,
I feel uncomfortable.

1:08:19.170 --> 1:08:21.300
- No, you don't. Just do it.
- DIANNE: Oh, come on, do it.

1:08:21.380 --> 1:08:23.180
See. Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.

1:08:23.260 --> 1:08:25.850
- Do it, do it, do it, do it.
- DIANNE: Come on, do it.

1:08:25.930 --> 1:08:28.060
I'm not a performing monkey.

1:08:30.980 --> 1:08:33.690
- The power's on.
- It's not, I tried it earlier.

1:08:33.770 --> 1:08:35.940
No, but the streetlights have come on.
It means the grid isn't out.

1:08:36.020 --> 1:08:38.150
It's the fuses. I'll just flip them back on,
we can watch television.

1:08:38.230 --> 1:08:39.280
LIZ: What about the lights?

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:42.320
Yes, we don't want to advertise our
whereabouts more than we already have.

1:08:42.410 --> 1:08:45.530
The lights operate on a separate circuit,
I'll just flip the mains breakers.

1:08:45.660 --> 1:08:47.660
It's quite simple, David.

1:09:16.310 --> 1:09:18.610
- Is that it?
- LIZ: That's it!

1:09:45.300 --> 1:09:48.930
Liz, have you got a quid?

1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:55.100
Yeah.

1:10:00.110 --> 1:10:02.230
Never anything on, is there?

1:10:06.530 --> 1:10:07.610
What?

1:10:10.620 --> 1:10:12.790
I think we might have a bit of a problem.

1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:15.160
What do you mean?

1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:19.630
They followed me.

1:10:20.420 --> 1:10:22.750
I thought you said you gave them the slip.

1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:23.960
Yeah.

1:10:25.930 --> 1:10:29.390
Well, we'll just have to be extra quiet, then,
won't we?

1:10:31.140 --> 1:10:32.390
What?

1:10:34.770 --> 1:10:36.480
- Ed, no!
- Ed, no!

1:10:37.310 --> 1:10:38.850
Turn it off!

1:11:11.140 --> 1:11:12.470
Shit!

1:11:13.310 --> 1:11:15.060
- Where the hell did he come from?
- I don't know.

1:11:19.150 --> 1:11:21.310
- Who the hell put this on?
- It's on random.

1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:22.440
For fuck's sake!

1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:25.940
Okay, Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.

1:11:26.030 --> 1:11:27.240
- What?
- The jukebox!

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:28.860
Liz, Ed, grab something weapony.

1:11:28.950 --> 1:11:30.910
- ED: What about the rifle?
- It's not real!

1:11:30.990 --> 1:11:32.280
- Cocktails?
- What do you mean?

1:11:32.370 --> 1:11:36.160
The flaming spirits. Drambuie, sambuca,
brandy. Get a rag in. Light it.

1:11:36.250 --> 1:11:37.910
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?

1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:40.370
How about pool?

1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:49.420
Okay, John, it's time at the bar!

1:12:08.950 --> 1:12:12.410
- I can't find the switches!
- Well, then get the fuses!

1:12:46.270 --> 1:12:49.110
- Why is Queen still on?
- We have a situation!

1:12:49.190 --> 1:12:50.280
I know!

1:12:51.490 --> 1:12:52.530
- Fuck this.
- Ed!

1:12:52.610 --> 1:12:54.160
Two seconds.

1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:55.280
Oi!

1:13:03.210 --> 1:13:04.790
Shaun!

1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:09.000
No!

1:13:11.220 --> 1:13:13.300
Yes! Yes! In the head!

1:13:18.220 --> 1:13:19.770
Shauny!

1:13:35.620 --> 1:13:38.120
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?

1:13:39.620 --> 1:13:41.500
Ed, for the last time, it's...

1:13:45.250 --> 1:13:46.960
I fucking knew it!

1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:49.540
What did I tell you? Big Al was right.

1:13:49.630 --> 1:13:50.710
Okay,

1:13:55.130 --> 1:13:57.090
but dogs can look up.

1:14:00.680 --> 1:14:02.930
- Okay, has anyone fired a gun before?
- Oh, yeah.

1:14:03.020 --> 1:14:04.940
- Apart from Ed?
- I'm a pacifist.

1:14:05.020 --> 1:14:06.140
Apart from David and Ed?

1:14:06.230 --> 1:14:07.730
Sorry, what was Ed's experience?

1:14:07.810 --> 1:14:09.980
He shot his sister in the leg with an air rifle.

1:14:10.070 --> 1:14:11.110
I think you should do it.

1:14:11.190 --> 1:14:13.740
- I think we should all do it.
- How can five people operate one gun?

1:14:13.820 --> 1:14:16.950
None of us have any real experience, okay?
Now, we've only got...

1:14:17.030 --> 1:14:18.620
- Twenty-nine.
- Twenty-nine bullets.

1:14:18.700 --> 1:14:20.450
- Call them "shells."
- We've only got 29 shells,

1:14:20.540 --> 1:14:21.910
we really need to work together on this.

1:14:21.990 --> 1:14:25.120
I need someone to help me reload,
everyone else to look out. I will fire.

1:14:25.210 --> 1:14:26.500
As Bertrand Russell once said,

1:14:26.580 --> 1:14:29.790
"The only thing that will redeem mankind
is cooperation."

1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:33.050
I think we can all appreciate
the relevance of that now.

1:14:33.130 --> 1:14:34.460
Was that on the back of a beer mat?

1:14:34.550 --> 1:14:35.920
Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.

1:14:36.010 --> 1:14:37.550
- I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1:14:40.100 --> 1:14:42.890
- They definitely want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.

1:14:43.810 --> 1:14:46.640
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

1:14:48.770 --> 1:14:51.190
- LIZ: Barbara?
- Oh, hello.

1:14:51.270 --> 1:14:54.030
- Would you like to come with me?
- That would be lovely.

1:14:56.070 --> 1:14:58.360
It's nice to meet you, finally.

1:14:59.530 --> 1:15:01.200
Shaun's always talking about you.

1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:02.660
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:15:03.910 --> 1:15:05.120
Barbara?

1:15:06.910 --> 1:15:08.620
Are you all right?

1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:11.210
I've got something for you.

1:15:12.590 --> 1:15:16.050
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

1:15:16.130 --> 1:15:18.010
I'd like you to have it.

1:15:18.090 --> 1:15:21.390
- Barbara, Shaun and I have...
- It seems only right.

1:15:37.530 --> 1:15:41.410
I didn't want to say anything.
I thought Shaun would be worried.

1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:46.240
SHAUN: Liz?
DAVID: Here they come!

1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:50.250
SHAUN: Stay behind me! Stay behind me!
DIANNE: There's one!

1:15:50.330 --> 1:15:51.370
Sorry, we're closed!

1:15:53.630 --> 1:15:55.380
- Try the safety button.
- Yeah, that happened to me on stage.

1:15:55.460 --> 1:15:56.710
Cock it!

1:16:04.810 --> 1:16:06.390
- Over there!
- Over where?

1:16:06.470 --> 1:16:07.810
3:00.

1:16:14.020 --> 1:16:15.980
Over there again. Quarter to twelve.

1:16:16.070 --> 1:16:17.480
What?

1:16:17.570 --> 1:16:19.740
-11:45.
- Keep it simple!

1:16:21.110 --> 1:16:22.360
Top left.

1:16:24.660 --> 1:16:26.410
- Reload.
- I'm on it!

1:16:32.750 --> 1:16:34.250
Nice shot.

1:16:34.340 --> 1:16:37.050
Okay, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!

1:16:37.130 --> 1:16:38.880
Ed, take over a sec.

1:16:40.220 --> 1:16:43.220
SHAUN: What is it? What's wrong?
LIZ: Shaun, I'm so sorry.

1:16:43.300 --> 1:16:46.510
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

1:16:49.850 --> 1:16:51.730
Mum, I don't understand.

1:16:51.810 --> 1:16:53.770
The man in his pajamas...

1:16:53.850 --> 1:16:56.560
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

1:16:56.650 --> 1:16:58.650
No, you should've said.

1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:02.240
- Take over a sec.
- DIANNE: What?

1:17:02.320 --> 1:17:04.700
- What's going on?
- ED: What's up? What's wrong?

1:17:04.780 --> 1:17:06.740
- What the hell's going on?
- Barbara's hurt!

1:17:06.830 --> 1:17:08.950
- Mum.
- Just take over a minute.

1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:12.210
- Jesus.
- DIANNE: I know first aid.

1:17:13.370 --> 1:17:17.590
- SHAUN: Just hang on. Mum? Mum?
- Is she...

1:17:17.670 --> 1:17:18.920
DIANNE: Shaun...

1:17:19.010 --> 1:17:21.380
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.

1:17:21.470 --> 1:17:24.050
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:29.310
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

1:17:31.430 --> 1:17:34.230
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?

1:17:35.350 --> 1:17:40.440
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, Mum,
come on, Mum, stop it, stop it, stop it.

1:17:40.530 --> 1:17:44.150
Don't, Mum. Please don't go.

1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:57.330
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.

1:17:57.420 --> 1:18:00.090
- Daffs!
- For Christ's sake!

1:18:00.170 --> 1:18:02.420
- She's gonna come back!
- SHAUN: She's not gone anywhere.

1:18:02.510 --> 1:18:05.680
- Well, she'll change.
- She's my mum.

1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:08.640
- She's a zombie.
- Don't say that!

1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:11.680
Move aside. I'm gonna count to three.

1:18:11.770 --> 1:18:15.270
One, two, three!

1:18:15.980 --> 1:18:17.730
Don't point that gun at my mum!

1:18:17.810 --> 1:18:19.520
Shaun, calm down!

1:18:19.610 --> 1:18:21.190
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:23.280
- Ed, don't exacerbate things!
- What does that mean?

1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:25.490
This isn't exactly fair!

1:18:25.570 --> 1:18:26.910
- Here.
- Thank you.

1:18:26.990 --> 1:18:28.490
ED: It's okay.

1:18:29.830 --> 1:18:32.160
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?

1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:34.370
Tell him to put the gun down!

1:18:34.460 --> 1:18:36.710
Look, Lizzie, she's gonna change.
You know I'm right.

1:18:36.790 --> 1:18:39.920
And when she does,
she'll come back and she'll kill all of us.

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:41.750
That's what your ex can't seem to realize.

1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:43.550
That's what this is about, isn't it?

1:18:43.630 --> 1:18:45.470
It's just... He just... He doesn't like me!

1:18:45.550 --> 1:18:47.760
He's always hated me
and now he wants to shoot my mum!

1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:48.840
She's not...

1:18:48.930 --> 1:18:51.350
You've never thought I deserved her,
that I was good enough.

1:18:51.430 --> 1:18:52.390
What are you talking about?

1:18:52.470 --> 1:18:55.180
Oh, come on,
we all know you're in love with Liz!

1:18:55.270 --> 1:18:56.350
That is not true!

1:18:56.440 --> 1:18:58.270
- SHAUN: Yes, it is!
- That is not true.

1:18:58.350 --> 1:19:00.310
- DIANNE: Yes, it is.
- What?

1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:03.900
I know you only hung out with me at college
to get close to Liz.

1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:06.900
And when she knocked you back,
I was there to pick up the pieces.

1:19:06.990 --> 1:19:10.370
I've come to terms with that, Daffs,
why can't you?

1:19:11.410 --> 1:19:14.490
Lizzie, I want you to know that my feelings
for you have always been essentially...

1:19:14.580 --> 1:19:18.080
David, please! There are slightly more
pressing matters at hand here!

1:19:18.170 --> 1:19:20.750
Like the fact
that "Daffs" is pointing a gun at my mum!

1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:23.090
I'm not the one
who's being unreasonable, "Pickle."

1:19:23.170 --> 1:19:24.920
For Christ's sake, she's not dead!

1:19:25.010 --> 1:19:28.010
She's finished!
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite!

1:19:28.090 --> 1:19:31.140
You're the one that's gone from being
a Chartered Accountant to Charlton Heston!

1:19:31.220 --> 1:19:34.390
- I'm not a Chartered Accountant!
- Well, you look like one!

1:19:34.470 --> 1:19:36.350
- Yeah!
- I'm a lecturer!

1:19:36.430 --> 1:19:38.310
- You're a twat!
- Yeah!

1:19:38.390 --> 1:19:42.060
She's not your mum anymore!
In a minute she'll be just another zombie!

1:19:42.150 --> 1:19:44.860
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.

1:19:44.940 --> 1:19:49.860
Please, can we just calm the fuck down?

1:19:51.160 --> 1:19:54.870
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...

1:19:54.950 --> 1:19:57.200
- Thank you, Lizzie.
- ... even if he is being a twat!

1:19:57.290 --> 1:19:58.330
Yep.

1:19:59.370 --> 1:20:02.460
And, Shaun, Shaun, look at me.

1:20:04.590 --> 1:20:08.300
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you,

1:20:08.380 --> 1:20:10.840
but we can't afford to fall apart.

1:20:12.050 --> 1:20:16.470
Shaun, babe,
I know you don't wanna hear this.

1:20:35.990 --> 1:20:37.330
You do it.

1:20:48.090 --> 1:20:49.630
I'm sorry, Mum.

1:20:51.630 --> 1:20:52.800
Do it!

1:21:08.940 --> 1:21:13.450
Well, I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.

1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:21.000
David, no!

1:21:22.870 --> 1:21:26.710
- David.
- Right, I'm leaving.

1:21:26.790 --> 1:21:28.550
- What?
- I'm not staying here.

1:21:28.630 --> 1:21:31.970
- David, don't, it's suicide.
- I think you should go.

1:21:32.050 --> 1:21:33.800
We will.
We can run, we can defend ourselves.

1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:36.800
- What do you mean "we?"
- What do you mean, "What do I mean 'we"'?

1:21:36.890 --> 1:21:40.560
Opening that door now would be
a very, very silly thing to do.

1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:42.060
So, are you gonna stay here with him?

1:21:42.140 --> 1:21:43.810
- Look, Shaun...
- After everything he's gotten us into!

1:21:43.890 --> 1:21:45.650
You let me finish!

1:21:45.730 --> 1:21:49.150
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason that I did,

1:21:49.230 --> 1:21:52.070
'cause you didn't know what else to do.
Get away from that door this instant!

1:21:52.150 --> 1:21:53.780
- But...
- David!

1:22:02.830 --> 1:22:03.960
I'm so sorry, Dianne.

1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:08.670
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologizing to.

1:22:10.500 --> 1:22:11.710
Shaun...

1:22:17.550 --> 1:22:20.050
David! No!

1:22:20.140 --> 1:22:23.020
No, no, no, no!

1:22:23.890 --> 1:22:25.310
David!

1:22:26.150 --> 1:22:27.270
No, no!

1:22:27.350 --> 1:22:28.860
David!

1:22:49.340 --> 1:22:50.840
David!

1:22:52.090 --> 1:22:53.960
- Dianne, no!
- Dianne, no!

1:22:54.050 --> 1:22:55.170
I'm coming, David!

1:22:56.010 --> 1:22:58.300
David! David!

1:23:01.890 --> 1:23:03.180
Oh, dear.

1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:05.350
- Cocktails?
- Do it.

1:23:16.450 --> 1:23:17.860
Stay back!

1:23:23.660 --> 1:23:25.290
Shaun, hold them!

1:23:28.790 --> 1:23:29.870
Heads!

1:23:34.340 --> 1:23:36.260
- Ed!
- Hurry up!

1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:39.760
Shauny, look who it is.

1:23:40.390 --> 1:23:42.050
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:45.850
Ed!

1:23:46.350 --> 1:23:48.100
- Shaun!
- Ed!

1:23:48.190 --> 1:23:50.020
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!

1:23:50.350 --> 1:23:52.110
I can't hold them!

1:23:55.650 --> 1:23:56.900
No!

1:24:00.860 --> 1:24:02.820
- Shaun!
- Pete!

1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:07.370
I said, leave him alone!

1:24:10.460 --> 1:24:13.710
Ed! Ed!

1:24:13.790 --> 1:24:15.960
Shaun, bar!

1:24:27.730 --> 1:24:34.230
Ed!

1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:36.480
What?

1:24:37.570 --> 1:24:39.610
Chuck us a cloth will you?

1:24:52.370 --> 1:24:54.750
- Where are the shells?
- They're on the bar.

1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:56.170
Oh, fuck!

1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:01.170
Fuck it!

1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:04.720
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:06.930
- The cellar!
- Maybe we can get out.

1:25:07.010 --> 1:25:09.100
There's a barrel hatch
that leads into the street.

1:25:09.180 --> 1:25:10.810
You mean go back outside?

1:25:12.690 --> 1:25:15.020
Oh, give us a fucking break!

1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:22.450
- Go!
- Go!

1:25:33.250 --> 1:25:35.040
I can see the street.

1:25:36.670 --> 1:25:37.880
Come on.

1:25:39.300 --> 1:25:40.760
Come on!

1:25:42.130 --> 1:25:44.340
Why won't it open?

1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:56.980
That's it, isn't it? We're trapped.

1:25:57.060 --> 1:25:58.980
"Hey, let's go to the Winchester!"

1:25:59.070 --> 1:26:01.230
Whose fucking idea was that?

1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:03.570
Man, I've really ballsed this up.

1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:10.830
- No, you haven't.
- I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.

1:26:10.910 --> 1:26:15.920
I couldn't save Di or David.
I couldn't even save my mum. I'm useless.

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:19.290
You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried.

1:26:19.380 --> 1:26:21.750
You did something, that's what counts.

1:26:23.420 --> 1:26:25.050
Yeah, I suppose.

1:26:28.510 --> 1:26:31.930
- Do you think they'll get through?
- Yeah.

1:26:34.100 --> 1:26:36.310
How many shells have we got left?

1:26:38.940 --> 1:26:43.610
Two. I suppose we could take
a few of them out if they stand in a line.

1:26:44.950 --> 1:26:48.700
- I wasn't thinking about them.
- I know.

1:26:53.870 --> 1:26:55.580
What about Ed? There's only two shells.

1:26:55.660 --> 1:26:57.670
ED: I don't mind being eaten.

1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:04.840
How are we gonna do this?

1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:06.760
I don't know.

1:27:07.470 --> 1:27:09.470
One of us has to go first.

1:27:09.550 --> 1:27:12.890
Maybe one should do the other
and then do themselves.

1:27:12.970 --> 1:27:16.430
Maybe you should do me.
I'll only muck it up if I have to do myself.

1:27:25.490 --> 1:27:27.070
Do you know, I don't think I've got it in me

1:27:27.150 --> 1:27:30.570
to shoot my flatmate, my mum
and my girlfriend all in the same evening.

1:27:33.790 --> 1:27:35.490
What makes you think I've taken you back?

1:27:38.540 --> 1:27:40.920
You don't want to die single, do you?

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.670
ED: Actually, I would like to be shot.

1:27:46.170 --> 1:27:50.010
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had
a fag since yesterday, I promise.

1:27:50.090 --> 1:27:51.430
ED: He hasn't.

1:27:54.260 --> 1:27:56.470
Maybe we should have one now.

1:27:58.230 --> 1:28:01.270
- What...
- You left them in my flat.

1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:04.650
- Yeah, in the bin.
- I was desperate.

1:28:04.730 --> 1:28:07.780
- Sneaky monkey.
- Sorry.

1:28:07.860 --> 1:28:09.650
I won't say anything.

1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:24.630
Come on, we're getting out of here.

1:28:25.710 --> 1:28:28.800
- I might just stay here.
- Yeah, but we can get out.

1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:32.260
- I think you two should make a go of it.
- What are you talking about?

1:28:32.340 --> 1:28:35.720
- I only hold you back.
- Yeah, but...

1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:43.150
Maybe you should have this.

1:28:43.940 --> 1:28:45.770
Don't you want it?

1:28:45.860 --> 1:28:48.900
No. I can't hit anything with it anyway,
I'm rubbish.

1:28:52.450 --> 1:28:55.740
- Ed, I'm sorry.
- What for?

1:28:57.160 --> 1:28:59.750
'Cause I was shouting at you earlier on.

1:28:59.830 --> 1:29:02.750
It's all right. I'm sorry, too.

1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:08.380
- It's okay.
- No, I'm sorry, Shaun.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:15.590
Oh, God, God. That's not funny.

1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:17.850
I'll stop doing them
when you stop laughing.

1:29:17.930 --> 1:29:19.560
SHAUN: I'm not laughing.

1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:34.780
You better be off.

1:29:44.290 --> 1:29:46.710
Bye, Ed. Love you.

1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:49.000
Cheers.

1:29:50.510 --> 1:29:52.300
I love you, too, man.

1:29:55.800 --> 1:29:57.470
Gay!

1:30:18.280 --> 1:30:21.120
- Ready?
- Ready.

1:30:30.630 --> 1:30:35.340
SOLDIER: Section One. Ready.
Zombies to your front. Fire!

1:30:36.430 --> 1:30:39.890
Section One. Targets to your front. Fire!

1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:59.200
- Oh, my God. Shaun!
- Yvonne?

1:31:04.660 --> 1:31:05.960
How you doing?

1:31:06.580 --> 1:31:07.960
- Surviving.
- Surviving.

1:31:08.040 --> 1:31:10.210
They're taking us somewhere safe.
I thought you two might wanna...

1:31:10.290 --> 1:31:12.460
- SOLDIER: Move it!
- ... tag along.

1:31:12.550 --> 1:31:14.550
Is it just the two of you?

1:31:17.300 --> 1:31:20.220
Well, glad somebody made it.

1:31:22.180 --> 1:31:23.390
Come on.

1:31:37.240 --> 1:31:40.990

1:33:02.110 --> 1:33:03.910
What's the plan, then?

1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:07.240
Right, a cup of tea,

1:33:07.330 --> 1:33:09.910
then we get the Sundays.

1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.500
Head down the Phoenix for a roast,

1:33:12.580 --> 1:33:14.830
veg out in the pub for a bit,

1:33:15.340 --> 1:33:18.500
then wander home, watch a bit of telly,
go to bed.

1:33:18.590 --> 1:33:21.130
- Perfect.
- I'll get the kettle on.

1:33:21.220 --> 1:33:22.680
Can I have two sugars, please?

1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:25.470
Adventurous.

1:33:25.550 --> 1:33:27.930
Actually, I might pop into the garden
for a bit.

1:33:28.010 --> 1:33:29.970
Go on, then.

1:33:30.060 --> 1:33:31.560
Two seconds.
