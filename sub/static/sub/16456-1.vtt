Anything can happen that innocent life you hold in your hands.

18:12.804 --> 18:18.685
Out there, 85 km wilderness in all directions.

18:24.316 --> 18:29.863

18:32.282 --> 18:35.994
Some of you may have had pets before.

18:36.119 --> 18:41.917
If not then I can tell that it is one of life's great pleasures.

18:42.042 --> 18:47.547
There's nothing like an animal's unconditional love.

18:47.673 --> 18:55.472

18:55.597 --> 19:02.187
But if you are wasting the chance ... I'm sure it does not.

And you were all U.S. citizens in September 1993.

19:58.827 --> 20:06.418
Hyun Jae. Would not have thought you were American with the name.

20:08.795 --> 20:14.301
Garden of Eden. Distinguished name for a trailer park.

Look, you get a day or two to get over the shock.

20:39.659 --> 20:43.330
Then you have to adapt to what we are doing here.

20:43.455 --> 20:48.752

20:48.877 --> 20:56.593
And after sex. Medical check daily. This is a clean place.

20:56.718 --> 21:02.849
The cleaner you are, the better for you. And for all.

21:06.394 --> 21:13.652
I need hardly explain the consequences for your family if you create problems?

21:15.278 --> 21:20.867

22:54.919 --> 22:59.174
Your bruises will disappear soon.

23:03.428 --> 23:07.599
Do you know how I got over my fear of needles?

23:07.724 --> 23:14.397
I think that someone cut my arm off with a chainsaw.

23:14.522 --> 23:18.026
Then the needle is nothing.

24:03.446 --> 24:04.656

Come her.

25:51.387 --> 25:55.600
Go, or I will cut off your clitoris with a cigar cutter.

25:55.725 --> 26:00.563
Do not be an ass, Vaughan. She is new. Okay, honey.

30:18.112 --> 30:22.449
- I'm calling the police. - She is a dangerous abuse.

I should not get involved. You can get hurt. Sorry.

30:29.331 --> 30:31.375
Help me!

31:47.451 --> 31:52.873
Let her be until tomorrow morning. See if she is still alive.

32:01.340 --> 32:05.010
Is your job description unclear, Vaughan?

32:05.135 --> 32:10.516
- I got her course. - But you did not get her Mexican?

32:10.891 --> 32:16.396
Do you have an idea what I need to do if you do not catch them?

32:17.773 --> 32:23.403
I knew it. That's why the shepherd loses his sheep.

32:23.529 --> 32:29.451
If I wanted a junkie to manage my affairs there are many on the street.

32:29.576 --> 32:33.831

32:33.956 --> 32:38.710

Get all the damn cat out of the way. Sell ​​them, let them drown in the river.

33:14.204 --> 33:18.834
Should I ask nicely? Will you do it for the hell? Now.

33:47.070 --> 33:50.991
A YEAR LATER

34:21.772 --> 34:28.487
I did not think she liked the cat. Why was she allowed to keep it?

34:29.154 --> 34:33.492

You took just as much for Russians and for us, but white girls cost more.

42:32.345 --> 42:36.140

42:36.265 --> 42:41.395

42:41.520 --> 42:45.316

43:08.506 --> 43:09.882
Why?

43:10.007 --> 43:13.552
I just turned 19, so I'm done, a broken product.

43:13.678 --> 43:16.514
- I'll fucking on ... - I'm ready, you know.

43:16.639 --> 43:20.017
- It's up to you. - Determines that?

43:20.142 --> 43:23.938
Yes! I decide. It is with a job.

43:25.398 --> 43:31.445
If nothing should be changed so that puts an end to it now. Press.

43:31.570 --> 43:34.448
Stop! It is enough! Cross!

43:37.785 --> 43:40.579
In you again.

43:41.706 --> 43:46.001
You make me crazy. Get in there now.

44:10.025 --> 44:12.862
- Are you Josh? - He's not here yet.

44:12.987 --> 44:15.531
- What? - He's not here yet.

44:15.656 --> 44:19.952
Well ... he has something to me.

44:20.077 --> 44:23.330
He comes with more money.

44:23.456 --> 44:27.626
I can give you half and a little coke until he comes.

44:27.751 --> 44:29.795
- Kom nu. - Ney.

44:29.920 --> 44:34.800
The fire is relax about five minutes.

44:36.510 --> 44:40.472
- Okay. - Mine Damer.

45:25.226 --> 45:32.149
- Can I get some? - Fuck you.

45:50.501 --> 45:53.420
Eden, you with me?

45:53.545 --> 45:58.717
You two stay there or I shower you with vodka and set fire to.

46:03.305 --> 46:09.812
- Are you Josh? Where the hell is my money? - Do not worry, I would not run with them.

46:12.106 --> 46:15.567
- Count them. - With Brants it all seven.

46:15.693 --> 46:20.447
- 1000, because you delayed us. - The other guy said 700

46:20.572 --> 46:21.990
- It's 1000. - 1000.

46:22.116 --> 46:24.868
- Is she a hooker or treasurer? - Regards you?

46:24.993 --> 46:29.123
I do not cheat, they said 700, that's what we have.

46:29.248 --> 46:33.001
Fuck you! How much does he owe?

46:33.127 --> 46:38.382
- Give me $ 300, now, dammit. - Do it, boys.

46:43.762 --> 46:46.557
Give them to her.

46:49.935 --> 46:52.521
We are white. Tak.

47:04.783 --> 47:07.202
Gathered them op!

47:10.164 --> 47:12.416
Pis og lort!

47:49.119 --> 47:53.248
You should take some. You deserve it.

48:57.813 --> 49:00.649
Need I go on toilette?

50:11.762 --> 50:13.180
Dig.

50:15.223 --> 50:19.770
Achtung, assholes! Today is a good day.

50:20.270 --> 50:21.605
Dig.

50:21.813 --> 50:27.486
Svetlana, you should be out today. You run with Ivan in cart.

50:28.069 --> 50:31.406
Out of the ranks. Does follow me.

50:41.583 --> 50:45.504
You have to clean here. And do it well.

50:45.629 --> 50:49.341
There are alarms on all windows and doors, I swear Eden -

50:49.466 --> 50:55.013
- If you're doing tricks again I will shoot you with all the weapons I have.

50:55.555 --> 50:59.309
Detergents. Get started.

52:48.293 --> 52:52.672
Okay, Eden takes over headphones. The switch places.

52:55.008 --> 52:56.634
What?

52:57.052 --> 53:02.891
- The kinesermær will not replace me! - Do not know what you're talking about.

53:03.016 --> 53:05.643
- Change me out. - I did not say.

53:05.769 --> 53:08.897
- She answers phones, you run. - I can not run.

53:09.022 --> 53:13.693
- Ivan teaches you that. - Fuck Ivan. Fuck you!

53:17.947 --> 53:23.286
Shit, man. I'm sending you back to Dubai. There can be ass fucked.

53:23.411 --> 53:26.664
See, now you're suddenly sensible.

53:28.750 --> 53:33.338
- Can I have a cigarette? - Do you act like a child?

53:33.463 --> 53:37.509
Nitchevo. I will not.

53:37.634 --> 53:42.222
Yes, take a cigaret.

53:43.223 --> 53:46.100
Let the damn cat be here.

54:13.127 --> 54:20.009
Okay. Only regulars have this number.

54:20.510 --> 54:26.683
They may code. Do not mention anything about people.

54:26.808 --> 54:32.814
We have a cheat note here. 5 x 5 are Latino. 5 x 9 Indian or Pakistani.

54:32.939 --> 54:37.110
5 x 12 You're Asian. 6 x 9 is black.

54:37.235 --> 54:39.362
9 x 10 hvid.

54:39.904 --> 54:45.326
If they ask for one special as you mix. Learn it by heart for tonight.

54:45.451 --> 54:48.788
- And the price? - Board never price. They know it already.

54:48.913 --> 54:53.084
They ask, it's probably the FBI. Just hang up.

54:53.209 --> 54:57.338
You'll just note address, date and time.

54:57.463 --> 55:02.427
Tear it off. Give it to me. Are you with me?

55:02.760 --> 55:03.928
And.

55:04.887 --> 55:11.185
- I test you. What is 5 x 9? - Indian or Pakistani.

55:11.311 --> 55:15.606
You are really good. I've just gone for a few hours.

55:15.732 --> 55:20.445
Kets can you please doctor cat.

55:42.800 --> 55:46.929
Release them out, but set handcuffs at first.

55:48.514 --> 55:51.601
How are you? How was your flight?

56:20.838 --> 56:24.509
- How you doing, Dave? - Good enough.

56:24.634 --> 56:27.804
- My dog ​​died. - I'm fucking sorry.

56:27.929 --> 56:32.099
She was 15. But as SOD. You may well remember.

56:32.225 --> 56:34.519
Yes, hun was skøn.

56:36.187 --> 56:40.733
I just got this, Persian white mixed with red.

56:40.858 --> 56:46.697
The plants are young but strong, I halved the usual dose.

56:47.990 --> 56:51.953
Frem the arm. Come with your arm!

57:08.010 --> 57:11.389
- Are you okay? Hold here. - She must not keep them.

57:11.514 --> 57:15.810
Concentrate. Hang on. How long till she goes out?

57:15.935 --> 57:19.313
With the mix, an hour?

57:19.438 --> 57:23.734
Perfect. I'll teach you to drive. Are you ready?

57:23.859 --> 57:29.198
Here we go. That way. Thank you, Dave. See you tomorrow.

57:30.408 --> 57:32.451
Continue down the road.

57:34.161 --> 57:37.999
The nurse gets all needles from a drug store in Reno.

57:38.124 --> 57:42.712
Do not step on the accelerator and brake at the same time. It does not work.

57:42.837 --> 57:46.173
We get leg irons from the parole board.

57:46.299 --> 57:48.926
Bob knows all there.

57:49.051 --> 57:53.514
Our Pakistani partners gives us passports and driving licenses.

57:53.639 --> 57:58.436
Can you stop the car? I have dårligt.

57:59.937 --> 58:04.191
We get opium from Mexico. We are alone.

58:04.317 --> 58:08.738
Morphine. Before it could not get anyone to do anything.

58:08.863 --> 58:13.576
You you on stueetagen in. ..

58:14.118 --> 58:19.248
... The most well-run enterprise. We work in all areas.

58:19.373 --> 58:23.210
Bob is not even at the top. It is much larger than Bob.

58:23.336 --> 58:26.964
The girls have it better here. Their parents junkie shit on them.

58:27.089 --> 58:30.760
They let them get diseases and all kinds of shit. It's sad.

58:30.885 --> 58:35.097
Svetlana's mother sold her to her grandfather when she was nine -

58:35.222 --> 58:40.019
- Because mom's new boyfriend would not have a brat in the house.

58:40.144 --> 58:44.607
It is diseased. So it goes too far.

58:48.694 --> 58:51.989
What the hell is wrong with you?

58:57.328 --> 59:02.374
Should probably would not have given you amphetamine after morphine syringe.

59:15.054 --> 59:18.015
Do you take checks?

59:18.140 --> 59:21.477
Should I take control?

59:21.602 --> 59:28.234
I'm not one of those bastards. Not one of the pricks.

59:28.359 --> 59:31.779
So away from me and run.

59:35.449 --> 59:40.204
What is it for a 19-year-old, who can not drive a car?

01:00:05.354 --> 01:00:09.775
Think of America's roads veins.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:16.198
The pumps nutrients and oxygen and keep the cells alive. A living organism.

01:00:16.323 --> 01:00:24.582
But we forget that the blood also leads waste products away from the cells.

01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:30.087
What happens then? Where are they?

01:00:31.672 --> 01:00:39.555
These waste products adapt to their environment, depending on what they are.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:45.853
And like all viruses are sabotaging the end system.

01:00:45.978 --> 01:00:51.150
That's how I can best explain the illegal trade.

01:00:51.275 --> 01:00:55.863
To view an average courier out.

01:00:57.281 --> 01:00:59.992
Rar old mand.

01:01:05.664 --> 01:01:10.919
Who would suspect a nice old lady?

01:01:11.378 --> 01:01:17.593
The nice old lady dumped more dirt in Vegas than Chernobyl the 1986th

01:01:17.718 --> 01:01:24.224
It took us five years to get busted her. So ... one who went out of high school.

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:28.062
Housewives. Biker.

01:01:28.687 --> 01:01:34.777
Upper-class girls. All kinds. So, who are you looking for?

01:01:35.944 --> 01:01:39.907
The answer is everyone.

01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:46.663
Good. Have a good trip home, ladies and gentlemen. Nice to talk to you.

01:01:51.752 --> 01:01:55.756
- Good to get away from the office. - Sheriff Gault!

01:01:57.925 --> 01:02:02.638
- Ron Greer. From Stove Canyon. - Lake Havasu? Fish Competition?

01:02:02.763 --> 01:02:08.936
No, I called your office. Would make contact now we're both here.

01:02:09.061 --> 01:02:12.606
Yes da. What ringede about?

01:02:12.731 --> 01:02:19.071
A double murder in river valleys last year. Deputy Sheriff Ellis and Albert Alawa.

01:02:19.196 --> 01:02:23.992
- God. How's the track? - Why would I talk to you.

01:02:24.118 --> 01:02:30.582
- You were in the area at the time. - Are you sure?

01:02:30.707 --> 01:02:36.463
Well, we have tested a GPS system. Most often does not produce anything.

01:02:36.588 --> 01:02:42.261
But the spores mobile activity sometimes. So we tried.

01:02:42.386 --> 01:02:48.100
Your mobile number showed up. Not in a precise place. 1.5 km from Raven Creek.

01:02:48.225 --> 01:02:51.812
- On hearing distance from the crime scene. - Damn me.

01:02:51.937 --> 01:02:54.731
I hope so not.

01:02:55.149 --> 01:03:00.112
Maybe it's a bad time, I can come by your office?

01:03:00.237 --> 01:03:07.369
Do not know what to say other than it is here, do not remember that I was there.

01:03:07.494 --> 01:03:15.252
And I do not remember having encountered two bodies. It is usual well to remember?

01:03:15.377 --> 01:03:17.713
Yes, I would imagine.

01:03:18.297 --> 01:03:23.594
I'll call if I were to think of anything, Mr. ...

01:03:23.719 --> 01:03:29.600
Greer. Thanks for your time. It was an excellent speech.

01:03:44.323 --> 01:03:49.453
- Dusty Oasis, can I help? - I have two 7 x 10

01:03:49.578 --> 01:03:56.335
- Okay. And address, please? - 129 Desert Sun Drive, Room 412th

01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:01.715
Desert Sun Drive, Room 412th And when it fits best?

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.510
- At 22 tonight. - Fine. Thank you.

01:04:05.636 --> 01:04:07.679
How much?

01:04:15.979 --> 01:04:19.566
- Excuse me? - What does it cost?

01:04:28.992 --> 01:04:32.996
- Undskyld, 600. - Okay, tack.

01:05:23.088 --> 01:05:26.174
What do we have?

01:05:27.801 --> 01:05:31.054
- We have one of aften. - Yes.

01:05:31.805 --> 01:05:34.933
We must get up early.

01:05:35.058 --> 01:05:40.313
I send Ivan. We'll fix it with Ivan, and then you're in bed.

01:05:40.439 --> 01:05:43.859
We must piss up early.

01:05:58.999 --> 01:06:03.295
- I thought of sending smoke signals. - Fine boat, Bob.

01:06:03.753 --> 01:06:08.216
You're not so naive and innocent anymore?

01:06:08.341 --> 01:06:12.429
- What's the deal behind? - The nurse prohibit burning.

01:06:12.554 --> 01:06:17.559
It smells out of the way. To be drowned or buried, and I do not dig.

01:06:17.684 --> 01:06:22.689
- Is our friend Svetlana with that? - Yes. Here she is.

01:06:27.068 --> 01:06:31.031
Hope there are walleye in the lake today.

01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:46.296
I say no to the Internet stuff.

01:06:46.421 --> 01:06:50.842
This industry should not be dressed up with technology.

01:06:50.967 --> 01:06:57.223
You just do it easier for a freak to trace the source.

01:06:59.309 --> 01:07:03.063
- What the hell is wrong with you? - What?

01:07:03.188 --> 01:07:08.902
Try to relax. Jeez, you make me nervous.

01:07:10.779 --> 01:07:15.408
So ... how's the investigation?

01:07:15.533 --> 01:07:21.873
- I heard about it. Is it ... - You think I want to talk about it?

01:07:21.998 --> 01:07:26.961
Vaughan is socially retarded, his foster parents were Mennonites.

01:07:27.087 --> 01:07:30.298
Religious fanatics.

01:07:30.548 --> 01:07:34.302
- Do you know what a Bible marker is? - Bob ...

01:07:34.427 --> 01:07:39.891
Be marked sections with them. There is little sayings on them.

01:07:40.016 --> 01:07:44.396
Vaughan was only the markers to play with.

01:07:44.521 --> 01:07:50.068
And he did not learn to read until he was 16 Was it 16?

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:55.281
It can go either way with such a godly upbringing.

01:07:55.407 --> 01:08:00.245
But Vaughan's primary instincts are not in the sacred direction.

01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:06.501
I believe that if you are born in sin ... so you live in sin.

01:08:09.045 --> 01:08:13.299
But the army trains him. The army is like a alfons.

01:08:13.425 --> 01:08:17.011
Tager anyone with a pulse ...

01:08:17.136 --> 01:08:19.973
Okay, Bob. It is enough.

01:08:20.098 --> 01:08:26.563
I give up. Can never get the boy to express his feelings.

01:08:26.688 --> 01:08:32.152
As to teach the blind colors. I'm trying to help you, kid.

01:08:32.277 --> 01:08:38.575
Believe me, it gets better for you when I finish with this.

01:08:43.121 --> 01:08:45.747
Oops! I fik one!

01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:55.133
See how it runs. Not worth the effort to clean it.

01:08:55.258 --> 01:08:57.510
Shut up!

01:09:55.777 --> 01:10:02.617
It was an order from the top. You can relax.

01:10:29.143 --> 01:10:31.187
- Where are you going? - The toilet.

01:10:31.312 --> 01:10:35.525
- You go when I say it. - Come on, Ivan.

01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:40.405
You go when I say it.

01:10:48.496 --> 01:10:51.207
By place. Excursion.

01:11:24.907 --> 01:11:28.286
- Chef, hey! What then? - You look good. Have you trained?

01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:31.205
Not required. Have dog.

01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:43.134
- How many months? - I do not know.

01:11:50.224 --> 01:11:55.396
- Not on my dining table. - Why not? Relax.

01:11:55.897 --> 01:12:01.736
- I've lost lighter. Got a light? - The cooker.

01:12:03.196 --> 01:12:06.282
Henter it? Ceiling.

01:12:09.243 --> 01:12:13.498
Stop talking to me on the fucking ... Roasted do you?

01:12:13.623 --> 01:12:16.000
- Yes. - Are you okay, girl?

01:12:16.125 --> 01:12:18.503
- Yes. - Come her.

01:12:22.256 --> 01:12:23.841
Sadan ja.

01:12:25.384 --> 01:12:29.597
Little girl. It'll be all right.

01:12:45.655 --> 01:12:49.909
- Is she new? - Approximately one year. I chose her.

01:12:50.034 --> 01:12:54.288
- The rooster in the hen house? - Do I borrow toilette?

01:12:54.914 --> 01:13:00.795
Yes. Down the hall to the right. Will you do me a favor?

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:05.716
Save shampoo so the damn thing does not use it to masturbate with.

01:13:05.841 --> 01:13:09.053
Oh god! Shut up.

01:14:05.234 --> 01:14:09.488
- Did it for you? - What? What are you doing here?

01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:15.995
- They provide me and my baby. - No. We must get you out of here.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.457
You look different.

01:14:19.832 --> 01:14:22.376
- Are you here with them? - No.

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:25.379
You are here with them!

01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:31.218
Quiet. They are on the side. Do they hear you kill me.

01:14:59.705 --> 01:15:02.625
Eden! Come here, damn it!

01:15:03.501 --> 01:15:05.544
Bob you on TV!

01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:09.256
... Searching for Sheriff Robert Gault is interrupted. The family ...

01:15:09.381 --> 01:15:12.593
- How he looks good. - Quiet! I want to hear.

01:15:12.718 --> 01:15:17.556
Gault was the son of a test pilot. He joined the army in 1977.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.184
Dit fede pig!

01:15:20.309 --> 01:15:23.312
- I want to hear! - Take it easy.

01:15:23.437 --> 01:15:26.315
Han blev sherif i 1985.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.778
Specialists in smuggling and illegal drugs.

01:15:30.903 --> 01:15:36.825
He is remembered as a husband, father, and an asset to his community and country.

01:15:36.951 --> 01:15:38.619
Pis og PAPIR!

01:16:05.396 --> 01:16:09.733
- Pull off the road. Away from the road! - Where?

01:16:09.858 --> 01:16:12.528
Here! Run into. Turn!

01:16:17.825 --> 01:16:19.618
Continue.

01:16:22.788 --> 01:16:25.916
Stop her. Stop.

01:16:32.131 --> 01:16:35.759
Say what you saw in the house.

01:16:38.554 --> 01:16:44.643
- A room which looked like a hospital. - You know what it's for?

01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:55.112
- Sell infants. - Say that again.

01:16:55.237 --> 01:16:57.906
- Why? - Say it again!

01:16:58.866 --> 01:17:01.118
Sell ​​infants.

01:17:01.493 --> 01:17:04.580
Do you get it bad?

01:17:04.705 --> 01:17:09.501
I mucked up the first time I saw it. Dig generating it.

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:12.880
Come on, Vaughan. Let's run.

01:17:13.255 --> 01:17:17.968
Are you really in on it here?

01:17:19.053 --> 01:17:25.392
For you shall not go so far and then just ... betray me.

01:17:29.021 --> 01:17:34.735
- Why would I betray you? - Not why, but how.

01:17:40.699 --> 01:17:43.327
Shut the fuck!

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:49.416
What do you want me to do?

01:17:55.506 --> 01:17:59.843
Everybody out. Out of the carriage.

01:18:03.138 --> 01:18:06.308
Out! Eden, out. You must see this.

01:18:06.433 --> 01:18:11.063
In addition, before I drag you out! It you do not want.

01:18:11.188 --> 01:18:16.568
Come out and down on his knees. See the way.

01:18:16.693 --> 01:18:20.113
- Do you shoot her? - No. You must. Take it.

01:18:20.239 --> 01:18:21.615
No.

01:18:22.282 --> 01:18:26.912
Hold it against her head. She felt nothing.

01:18:27.037 --> 01:18:29.998
Smertefrit. Humant.

01:18:37.506 --> 01:18:39.758
Shoot her.

01:18:46.974 --> 01:18:50.602
If it is not her then it becomes you.

01:19:12.583 --> 01:19:15.460
Come her. Come her.

01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:22.050
Can not believe that you would actually do it. Crazy girl.

01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:28.890
Want some food? Are you hungry?

01:19:32.519 --> 01:19:35.188
Come on, we get something to eat.

01:19:35.314 --> 01:19:43.196
That's fine. Relax. I was joking. You know what that means? Into the cart.

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.227
- Hallo? - Vaughan?

01:20:14.478 --> 01:20:19.816
- Where are you? You have to go back now. - We are on the way back now.

01:20:19.941 --> 01:20:26.448
We have orders to pack. Must get the girls ready for transport.

01:20:50.347 --> 01:20:52.766
Ivan, you live yet?

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:58.313
Avni, I asked you to destroy the traitor's head. Do I need to do your work?

01:21:02.526 --> 01:21:04.861
Do it for anything in the world.

01:21:05.612 --> 01:21:06.863
Come.

01:21:22.546 --> 01:21:24.589
What happens?

01:21:28.176 --> 01:21:31.179
- We're moving. - Where to?

01:21:32.305 --> 01:21:37.018
We'll find out. We move boxes.

01:21:39.062 --> 01:21:41.565
They are dirty.

01:21:56.913 --> 01:22:00.292
There is no time to be sentimental, Eden.

01:22:00.417 --> 01:22:04.170
We wear them out of the fire.

01:22:36.995 --> 01:22:44.252
Do you remember when Ivan took only away for Christmas? I think he's got problems.

01:22:44.377 --> 01:22:48.757
The dirt has gået with a microphone silk januar.

01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:53.553
Bob was lucky that we took him at that time.

01:22:53.678 --> 01:23:00.894
He ended up as an asshole and not the brand that everyone loves and laments.

01:23:01.019 --> 01:23:05.065
Go through passports and choose one that looks like you.

01:23:05.190 --> 01:23:09.527
- Where are we going? - What? We're going to Dubai.

01:24:13.383 --> 01:24:18.221
- Are you afraid to go to Dubai? - Yes.

01:24:18.513 --> 01:24:25.895
Do not whore out there. It's you and me. What it is.

01:24:27.814 --> 01:24:33.570
We know everything about how the organization works. We can take over.

01:24:33.695 --> 01:24:37.490
- We are well Kompagnons? - Yes.

01:25:08.563 --> 01:25:13.359
Can you give me some water? I need some water.

01:27:37.003 --> 01:27:39.505
May I come in?

01:27:47.889 --> 01:27:49.932
Sæt dig.

01:27:59.734 --> 01:28:04.614
- I will buy Priscilla. - How much do you have?

01:28:08.993 --> 01:28:11.329
It's not enough.

01:28:15.583 --> 01:28:19.545
Can I do anything but give you money?

01:28:22.924 --> 01:28:27.720
I remember you. When you first came here.

01:28:28.429 --> 01:28:34.352
- I know. Do you remember me? - No.

01:28:42.026 --> 01:28:45.112
- Can I see happen? - Why?

01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:50.910
- You can take the money. - You give me permission? Thank you.

01:28:56.582 --> 01:29:03.506
Do you know how to see that they are not fake? Ink. The smudge-resistant.

01:29:03.923 --> 01:29:06.133
Her Ser you?

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:13.140
The Czechs did not even shit. It is no hundred dollar bill.

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:16.060
Kun skide one person.

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:25.528
You can see happen in five minutes. So you must go.

01:29:25.653 --> 01:29:28.072
Clear lommerne.

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:41.961
So do we.

01:30:16.203 --> 01:30:20.541
Priscilla, we may væk! Trolley op! We may væk!

01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:24.420
- I can not. My baby is here. - It's not here.

01:30:24.545 --> 01:30:27.256
- Where is she? - Do not know. They took her.

01:30:27.381 --> 01:30:32.636
- You may train! El ruisenor! - Nej. Trust me. We must go now.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:38.893
Listen. I did not take your baby. Mario sold her. I'm sorry.

01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:43.355
I'll explain later. Now we must go.

01:30:57.912 --> 01:31:01.415
I am so sorry that I did not before.

01:31:07.838 --> 01:31:10.716
We may go. Come.

01:31:12.718 --> 01:31:15.137
Chair of me, okay?

01:31:21.143 --> 01:31:23.395
Come on. Do not look.

01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:30.629
Hello?

01:32:34.717 --> 01:32:36.301
Hello?

01:32:38.595 --> 01:32:39.722
Their own.

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:46.437
Hyun Jae? S you? Hyun Jae?

01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:37.362
