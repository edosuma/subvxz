'In the criminal justice system,

00:02.812 --> 00:06.317

Mom? Mom, it's me.

00:21.923 --> 00:24.635
l-l'm sorry, l-l know it's late.

00:24.677 --> 00:27.140
l-l'm sorry you've been worried.

00:27.181 --> 00:29.225
l-l-l need a ride!

00:30.477 --> 00:32.771
l-l'm pretty far away.

00:33.607 --> 00:36.319
Mom, I was... I was attacked!

00:36.361 --> 00:38.405
I was raped!

00:38.446 --> 00:40.701
Yes, that's what I said.

00:41.952 --> 00:44.247
21st and 7th.

00:44.289 --> 00:46.542
No, I'm not OK.

00:49.714 --> 00:52.175
This man, he drove me to a vacant lot

00:52.217 --> 00:54.052
and he pulled out a gun.

00:54.094 --> 00:57.600
He told me to get out and then he did it.

00:57.642 --> 00:59.644
- He raped you?
- Yes.

00:59.686 --> 01:02.398
He said if I told anyone, he'd kill me.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.485
Why did you get into his car?

01:04.527 --> 01:06.738
I just got in.

01:06.780 --> 01:10.286
- You just got in?
- Yes.

01:10.327 --> 01:13.456
- Why?
- I sort of knew him.

01:14.082 --> 01:18.213
- I thought he was a stranger.
- He was. We met in a chat room.

01:18.255 --> 01:20.550
Oh, like, on the Internet?

01:20.591 --> 01:24.431
Yeah. He seemed decent enough,
by e-mail and everything.

01:24.472 --> 01:27.184
So you did know him.

01:27.226 --> 01:30.772
This was the first time seeing him in person.

01:30.814 --> 01:33.694
We'll ask you to work
with a sketch artist later.

01:33.735 --> 01:35.572
I can do that.

01:35.613 --> 01:40.371
- How'd you know it was him?
- He said he'd be in a beige Mercury Sable

01:40.413 --> 01:43.333
and he'd meet me at the coffee house
at 7 o'clock.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.210
What was his name?

01:45.252 --> 01:48.674
I only know his screen name.
The Yachtsman.

01:49.551 --> 01:52.888
- The Yachtsman?
- I thought with a name like that

01:52.930 --> 01:55.142
he'd be a gentleman.

01:56.686 --> 01:59.148

Karen Raye, 16, gave us these drawings
of the man who raped and abducted her.

02:54.687 --> 02:57.983
- Abducted?
- It's not a stranger abduction.

02:58.025 --> 03:02.364
- I guess this is not his real name.
- Yachtsman? Call the coastguard.

03:02.406 --> 03:05.912
- It's a chat room name.
- Right now that's all we've got.

03:05.954 --> 03:10.585
I love the information superhighway.
Meet new creeps without leaving home.

03:10.626 --> 03:14.466
- How's the victim?
- Pretty shaken up last night.

03:14.507 --> 03:16.177
We'll reinterview her.

03:16.218 --> 03:20.183
By the time the lab get back,
this guy could be halfway round the world.

03:20.224 --> 03:21.935
We have to move now.

03:21.977 --> 03:24.981
Can we see her computer?
It's a direct route to this guy.

03:25.023 --> 03:27.276
Yeah. Raye lives in Brooklyn.

03:27.319 --> 03:31.574
You and Munch pick up the computer,
try to put a name to this Yachtsman.

03:31.616 --> 03:35.121
70 million people on the Internet.
Every one a suspect.

03:37.207 --> 03:40.754
- You got into his car about seven?
- Around seven o'clock.

03:40.795 --> 03:44.885
- And you reached hospital at 11?
- That sounds about right.

03:44.926 --> 03:47.847
What happened before the attack?
You talk to him?

03:47.889 --> 03:50.351
- Sure.
- What'd you talk about?

03:50.393 --> 03:52.438
My school, my family.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.402
I was pretty eager to meet this guy.
Stupid, isn't it?

03:56.444 --> 03:58.655
You'd corresponded for a while?

03:58.697 --> 04:02.202
E-mail? About three to four months.

04:02.243 --> 04:05.373
Why'd you choose last night
to meet this guy?

04:05.415 --> 04:09.545
Well, we'd been talking about it
for a while, on line, I mean.

04:09.587 --> 04:13.010
And I... Last night
just seemed like the right time.

04:13.052 --> 04:15.929
- Who picked the date, you or him?
- I did.

04:15.971 --> 04:18.016
Then, why last night?

04:18.059 --> 04:22.523
I thought I could get out.
Tuesday night is Mom's big night out.

04:22.565 --> 04:24.609
Choir practice.

04:24.650 --> 04:26.738
So you just got in his car

04:26.780 --> 04:29.575
and you drove around
for three or four hours.

04:31.035 --> 04:32.914
Seems like a long time.

04:33.539 --> 04:36.251
Yeah, well, not all of it was driving.

04:36.293 --> 04:38.379
Some of it was just parking.

04:39.172 --> 04:42.052
OK. You know what I think we should do?

04:42.093 --> 04:46.557
We'll grab a car, retrace your route,
it may help you remember.

04:47.310 --> 04:50.022
You mean go all the places all over again?

04:50.064 --> 04:52.483
- Yeah.
- Do we have to?

04:52.524 --> 04:55.906
Karen, that's how
we're going to find this guy.

05:03.416 --> 05:06.921
What time did your daughter leave
last night, Ms Raye?

05:06.962 --> 05:09.217
I dropped her at the library at 6:15.

05:09.258 --> 05:11.720
I went to check on her at 8:30. She'd gone.

05:11.762 --> 05:13.597
You went to check on her?

05:13.639 --> 05:16.936
Yeah. I'd stay all night
if I didn't have choir practice.

05:16.977 --> 05:20.023
- So, you don't trust her?
- No, I trust her.

05:20.065 --> 05:23.194
Ronald Reagan said, 'Trust, but verify.'

05:23.237 --> 05:25.907
- She's at that age.
- What age is that?

05:25.949 --> 05:29.663
She has a woman's body
but the sense of judgment of a child.

05:29.704 --> 05:33.418
- Problems with boyfriends?
- She's too young for boyfriends.

05:33.460 --> 05:38.217
- It's not unusual for a girl her age to date.
- Well, she doesn't date.

05:38.258 --> 05:43.849
She can attend church or school functions,
as long as there's a chaperon.

05:43.891 --> 05:46.854
She can bring a boy home
as long as he's a friend.

05:46.896 --> 05:50.734
- Has she done that?
- No.

05:51.986 --> 05:55.033
I thought the weirdo that did this
was from the Internet.

05:55.075 --> 05:57.620
She didn't know him, but he may know her.

05:57.662 --> 06:00.124
Could we look at her computer?

06:00.959 --> 06:04.505
I won't have a computer here.
It's at her father's place.

06:04.546 --> 06:07.218
- You're divorced?
- We never married.

06:07.259 --> 06:11.348
When I was Karen's age, no one looked
out for me the way I do for her.

06:11.390 --> 06:14.728
- Do you allow her to visit him?
- I don't allow it.

06:14.770 --> 06:18.484
He got a court order forcing me
to let her go every other weekend.

06:18.526 --> 06:21.196
And if that makes sense, you tell me.

06:24.325 --> 06:27.079
- Is this where he picked you up?
- Yes.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.376
- OK, which corner?
- Right over there.

06:30.417 --> 06:34.715
- What direction was he driving?
- This direction.

06:34.757 --> 06:38.096
- Just tell us where to turn, OK?
- Make a quick left.

06:43.938 --> 06:46.983
This right here is a one-way,
I can only take a right.

06:47.901 --> 06:50.739
Well, I guess I was wrong. Go right.

06:50.781 --> 06:54.244
- Are you sure?
- I said go right, OK?

06:55.996 --> 06:57.707
OK.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.966
Karen's a good kid. Studies hard.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.679
- Is she an A-student?
- Were you?

07:06.720 --> 07:09.182
I was, except for the sciences and Spanish.

07:09.224 --> 07:12.938
- What about her computer usage?
- She downloaded a lot of songs.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.816
You monitor where she surfed?

07:14.857 --> 07:18.320
Karen knows more about that than I do.
What's to monitor?

07:18.362 --> 07:21.283
- She met her attacker on line.
- I know.

07:21.325 --> 07:24.830
Would you mind if we took
your computer for a few days?

07:25.623 --> 07:27.126
What?

07:27.960 --> 07:31.966
There are naked pictures
on there too, they're not hers.

07:32.007 --> 07:34.427
- They're yours?
- It's not porn.

07:34.469 --> 07:37.306
It's nudes. Women posing with big cats.

07:37.348 --> 07:40.644
Lions, leopards. It's password protected.

07:40.686 --> 07:44.442
- She can't get to them.
- I'm sure she never saw a thing.

07:46.111 --> 07:48.824
- This where it happened?
- Yes.

07:53.622 --> 07:57.336
Lot of people around.
No one saw you or heard anything?

07:57.378 --> 08:00.924
I don't know. I was scared, I was terrified.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.724
You don't believe me?

08:06.766 --> 08:09.520
It's like they say!
This is worse than the rape.

08:09.562 --> 08:12.608
It was here and you guys
act like I'm making this up!

08:12.650 --> 08:14.820
Karen, we just need the details right.

08:14.862 --> 08:18.367
If you're hiding something,
you must come clean.

08:18.409 --> 08:22.205
He put a gun to my head, told me
to take my pants off and raped me.

08:22.247 --> 08:24.501
And you guys don't believe me!

08:29.507 --> 08:31.803
How did you get my dad's computer?

08:31.845 --> 08:35.349
Your father wants to catch this guy
as much as we do.

08:37.018 --> 08:39.898
OK, Karen, why not wait for us in that room?

08:39.940 --> 08:43.278
Debbie'll get you a soda. OK?
Right in there.

08:48.286 --> 08:51.206
- What is that?
- That is Leopardus pardalis,

08:51.248 --> 08:54.336
commonly known as the ocelot,
posing with Bree Crosley.

08:54.378 --> 08:56.630
Commonly known as Miss September.

08:56.672 --> 08:58.842
It's her father's stuff.

08:58.883 --> 09:01.513
Yeah, we're thinking there is no Yachtsman.

09:01.555 --> 09:05.560
Then who sends her justifications
for May-December relationships?

09:05.601 --> 09:08.440
- What's in here?
- Derivative symbolist poetry,

09:08.481 --> 09:11.610
plus pictures, but they're encrypted.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.865
We got a tech guy
who thinks he can show them to us.

09:14.906 --> 09:18.078
We read some of the things
this guy e-mailed to you.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.581
Oh, no.

09:19.622 --> 09:24.379
- He's a predator. Why protect him?
- I'm not protecting him.

09:26.048 --> 09:28.969
He didn't take you to that parking lot, did he?

09:29.011 --> 09:30.346
No.

09:30.388 --> 09:32.725
You made that part up?

09:40.862 --> 09:42.488
Yes.

09:42.530 --> 09:44.409
Listen, it's OK.

09:44.451 --> 09:48.164
We just need you to tell us
what really happened.

09:48.205 --> 09:50.041
Karen, look at me.

09:50.083 --> 09:54.214
Even though he didn't use force,
he still took advantage of you.

09:54.256 --> 09:56.926
We can charge him with statutory rape.

09:56.968 --> 10:00.265
Those cases are taken very seriously
nowadays.

10:00.307 --> 10:03.019
- Could he go to jail?
- Yes, he could.

10:07.776 --> 10:09.653
What have I done?

10:13.409 --> 10:16.873
- I never met the Yachtsman.
- What?

10:18.207 --> 10:22.380
He was this guy that me
and my girlfriends used to e-mail.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.675
As a joke.

10:24.717 --> 10:27.262
OK, so who were you with?

10:28.014 --> 10:30.267
I was with my boyfriend, Keith.

10:30.309 --> 10:32.395
So why tell us you were raped?

10:33.646 --> 10:35.734
Because we made love

10:35.775 --> 10:38.654
and I didn't want my mom to find out.

10:40.323 --> 10:43.453
She's totally paranoid, she would've known.

10:43.494 --> 10:46.373
How?

10:46.415 --> 10:50.129
When I come home,
she makes me undress in front of her.

10:51.006 --> 10:53.301
And, erm, she smells my hair.

10:53.342 --> 10:56.179
She's a total fascist.

10:56.220 --> 11:00.144
Please. Please don't tell my mother.
She'll kill me.

11:00.186 --> 11:03.273
Karen, nothing
your mother does or might do

11:03.315 --> 11:05.611
justifies filing a false police report.

11:05.652 --> 11:09.115
- You understand that's a serious crime?
- I'm sorry.

11:09.157 --> 11:12.704
All this time we spent looking
for someone who doesn't exist

11:12.746 --> 11:16.959
is time that we didn't spend
trying to help women who were raped.

11:17.001 --> 11:20.799
- You think about them.
- I'm sorry. What can I do?

11:24.346 --> 11:27.267
First, recant the story you told us earlier,

11:27.309 --> 11:30.563
then tell us what really happened.

11:30.605 --> 11:34.402
- Are you gonna arrest my boyfriend?
- Why would we do that?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.989
Because he's 21.

11:39.784 --> 11:41.829
We should talk to him.

11:42.498 --> 11:45.585
- Karen?
- Yeah, your girlfriend. Karen Raye.

11:45.627 --> 11:49.591
- Has something happened?
- We're sorting that out. She's OK.

11:49.633 --> 11:51.886
- Come on.
- That's good.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.350
- How old are you?
- 21.

11:55.391 --> 11:57.770
- How old is she?
- 16.

11:59.229 --> 12:03.653
I know, but she is more mature
than any girl I've met in college.

12:03.695 --> 12:07.241
Keith, trust me, she's not that mature.

12:10.038 --> 12:12.457
- You know why we're talking?
- No.

12:13.167 --> 12:17.131
You ever hear of statutory rape?

12:18.382 --> 12:21.511
Now, you seem like a nice guy to me.

12:21.553 --> 12:24.850
- Do you like her?
- Yeah.

12:24.892 --> 12:27.896
- You love her?
- Yeah.

12:27.938 --> 12:30.441
You don't seem too sure.

12:34.030 --> 12:38.496
Look, give it a rest. A year, year and a half,

12:38.537 --> 12:42.959
you still think you want to go out with her,
hey, you'll have no problems with me.

12:44.879 --> 12:46.758
Yeah, I hear you.

12:49.052 --> 12:52.181
Good. That's it.

12:53.643 --> 12:55.521
Thanks.

12:57.981 --> 13:02.530
The only difference between here
and robbery is robbery victims don't lie.

13:02.572 --> 13:05.743
It's not a waste of time.
Seen Yachtsman's letters?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.831
That was hot air.
He didn't try to set up a meeting.

13:08.873 --> 13:10.750
- Not with her.
- But?

13:10.793 --> 13:12.461
We did a little digging.

13:12.503 --> 13:15.758
He e-mailed her some photos of himself.
Take a look.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.887
The man's face is blacked out
but not his date's.

13:19.721 --> 13:23.269
- How old is that girl?
- Not old enough. Not nearly.

13:23.311 --> 13:27.024
- I don't need to look at this crap.
- It's evidence, Elliot.

13:27.733 --> 13:30.154
How many photos were on her computer?

13:30.196 --> 13:34.326
Too many. I guess he sent them
several times a day.

13:34.368 --> 13:38.082
Every time I open my e-mail
I have messages waiting for me.

13:38.123 --> 13:44.132
They're always from Tina, or Betsy or Mitsy
with something to show me.

13:44.174 --> 13:48.931
- 'Hottest teen site on the net.'
- They're just there when you log on.

13:48.972 --> 13:53.521
If they are teens.
You can't tell their ages. Even if it's that girl.

13:53.563 --> 13:58.278
It can be a cut-and-paste job
scanned in from a Sears catalogue.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.781
And if we get them...

13:59.823 --> 14:03.536
Dickie, Maureen, Elizabeth
and Kathleen do too, I know.

14:05.455 --> 14:06.916
It scares me.

14:08.793 --> 14:13.133
Honey, it scares me too but I can't
just walk in and restrain the guy.

14:13.175 --> 14:15.470
Why not?

14:15.512 --> 14:19.309
These predators, tell me where they are.
I can't hear 'em or see 'em.

14:19.351 --> 14:21.145
But they're out there.

14:22.939 --> 14:25.025
Honey, they're in here.

14:29.198 --> 14:32.327
- He's one of your Internet users?
- Clients.

14:32.369 --> 14:34.623
And we value their privacy. Sorry.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.544
We believe he posed for sex pictures.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.797
- So?
- With a minor.

14:39.839 --> 14:42.677
I'm sure your other clients
would want to know

14:42.718 --> 14:45.012
you're trying to fight this problem.

14:45.054 --> 14:47.975
OK. What do you want to know
about this Yachtsman?

14:48.016 --> 14:49.853
Where he is.

14:52.148 --> 14:56.530
- It'll just take a minute.
- You just need an e-mail address?

14:56.571 --> 14:59.450
Once you're on line
we can follow you anywhere.

14:59.492 --> 15:01.537
So much for anonymity.

15:01.578 --> 15:04.250
What happens when you click on Amazon?

15:04.291 --> 15:08.839
- It says, 'Welcome, Olivia Benson.'
- Before you even type anything.

15:08.880 --> 15:13.429
Every time you click that mouse,
you send out personal info, via cookies.

15:13.471 --> 15:17.184
The Internet's just a tape recorder
that runs 24 hours a day.

15:18.937 --> 15:21.524
OK.

15:21.566 --> 15:25.113
- Yachtsman. Real name Harry Waters.
- Waters?

15:25.154 --> 15:29.035
Seems he likes to visit just about
every kind of sex chat room.

15:29.077 --> 15:31.580
- Underage stuff?
- Not exclusively.

15:31.622 --> 15:36.170
Also visited mainstream porn sites,
programming sites, music sites.

15:36.212 --> 15:38.257
What are the music sites?

15:38.298 --> 15:41.595
Britney Spears,
Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees.

15:41.637 --> 15:44.933
- My daughter likes them.
- He gets about, like any user.

15:44.975 --> 15:48.063
He also likes poker and auctions.

15:48.105 --> 15:49.941
What did he buy at eBay?

15:49.983 --> 15:53.488
Looks like... panties.

15:53.530 --> 15:56.909
Used panties.
He won seven panty auctions last year.

15:56.951 --> 16:00.999
- That's disgusting.
- Very. You got his home address?

16:01.040 --> 16:03.711
- It's a work address.
- So give us that.

16:03.752 --> 16:07.257
Universal. Net.
Had their IPO right after we did.

16:07.298 --> 16:09.720
- Never liked the guy.
- So why hire him?

16:09.761 --> 16:13.307
He was the best.
He's a really good programmer.

16:13.349 --> 16:16.438
- But?
- Y'know, after the IPO,

16:16.479 --> 16:18.941
we sprung for a trip to Cuba to see a game.

16:18.983 --> 16:21.444
- The Orioles?
- Yeah. It was a big deal.

16:21.486 --> 16:23.949
And Waters didn't even go to the game.

16:23.991 --> 16:27.704
- So, where did he go?
- Said he was sick, something he ate.

16:27.745 --> 16:29.665
So we felt bad for the guy,

16:29.708 --> 16:32.753
got him some souvenirs.
We go to his room with 'em.

16:32.795 --> 16:35.423
This little kid comes out of the bathroom.

16:35.464 --> 16:39.471
She says, in English,
'You want good time, too?'

16:39.513 --> 16:42.517
We get back to the States,
we'd look at him and think,

16:42.559 --> 16:45.856
'What makes this guy tick
that a little kid turns him on?'

16:45.897 --> 16:47.649
He quit right after that.

16:47.691 --> 16:49.402
You still have his computer?

16:49.444 --> 16:51.113
- You want it?
- We'd love it.

16:51.155 --> 16:54.410
No one here would touch it.
It was like a contagion.

16:55.453 --> 16:57.330
It's all yours.

16:57.372 --> 16:59.625
- Who's this?
- That's him.

17:00.669 --> 17:04.214
His computer hasn't been touched.
Forget about an address.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.136
- But?
- Check this out.

17:06.176 --> 17:08.179
File names for pictures.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.726
'Girl Love. Hot 14. Horny Teen.'

17:11.767 --> 17:16.150
He has text files called
Diary, Personal E-mail, School Schedules,

17:16.191 --> 17:18.193
for a couple of dozen girls.

17:18.234 --> 17:22.367
We can go to the DA.
Stalking, illegal porn, intent to distribute.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.662
- If we had the files.
- I thought we did.

17:24.704 --> 17:28.001
Just names.
Like an inventory list with no inventory.

17:28.041 --> 17:30.921
The real stuff is off-site, over a phone line.

17:30.963 --> 17:34.384
- He's covering his ass.
- So let's uncover it.

17:34.426 --> 17:38.640
- Whose phone line is he using?
- 7-1-8 area code, Brooklyn Heights.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.769
'Van Eschen, Keith.'

17:43.023 --> 17:45.775
Keith? That son of a bitch.

17:45.818 --> 17:49.072
He squatted his files in my system.
It's not my stuff.

17:49.114 --> 17:51.743
- Your system, your house.
- It's kiddy porn.

17:51.784 --> 17:53.454
They're not my files.

17:53.495 --> 17:57.001
Doesn't matter.
Someone asks me to store illegal stuff,

17:57.043 --> 18:00.422
he's either my best friend
or I get something out of it.

18:00.464 --> 18:03.259
- He's not my friend.
- So what's in it for you?

18:03.301 --> 18:07.850
You got the pictures of her, e-mails.
Pictures of dozens of other girls.

18:07.892 --> 18:09.602
I don't know how that got there.

18:11.189 --> 18:14.943
- Do we look like imbeciles to you?
- They're just pictures, man.

18:14.985 --> 18:17.238
They're not just pictures!

18:18.490 --> 18:21.411
These are underage girls, terrified, drugged,

18:21.453 --> 18:26.210
photographed without permission,
you snot-nosed son of a bitch!

18:26.252 --> 18:29.548
You're going to tell me what I want to know.

18:29.590 --> 18:31.634
You got that?

18:31.676 --> 18:34.263
Now, are those your pictures or aren't they?

18:34.305 --> 18:37.894
- Yeah.
- Right, now start explaining.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.901
It started small.

18:46.030 --> 18:49.995
Just one girl.
My buddy had a falling-out with this girl,

18:51.455 --> 18:55.836
so we took some nude photos he took
of her and he put 'em up on the net,

18:55.878 --> 18:57.922
to get back at her.

18:57.964 --> 19:00.968
- And you did him that favour?
- Yeah.

19:02.095 --> 19:06.477
We didn't expect all these guys
to e-mail us, asking us about her.

19:06.518 --> 19:08.563
What kind of guys?

19:08.605 --> 19:12.736
Guys who saw the pictures,
got turned on and were willing to pay.

19:12.778 --> 19:16.282
And thus a business was born.

19:16.325 --> 19:18.578
At first it was just girls we knew,

19:18.620 --> 19:21.499
girls we were dating, girls we picked up.

19:21.540 --> 19:25.671
But the money was big. And it was real.

19:27.132 --> 19:29.217
So we started taking requests.

19:29.259 --> 19:33.141
They'd go, 'Get me a redhead.
I want a flat-chested girl.'

19:33.183 --> 19:35.895
I don't know, these guys are freaks.

19:35.936 --> 19:38.732
But they got money and you're their pimp.

19:38.774 --> 19:42.863
- I just give people what they want.
- That's what I said.

19:42.905 --> 19:46.035
You're a pimp, for cyberjohns.
You're a pimp.

19:46.077 --> 19:47.536
Guys like the Yachtsman?

19:48.830 --> 19:51.209
Yeah. Him and others.

19:52.168 --> 19:55.673
- What about the money?
- They paid in net cash,

19:55.715 --> 19:57.384
in credits on websites.

19:57.426 --> 20:01.265
All untraceable cyberbucks.
That was the genius of it.

20:01.307 --> 20:05.395
- To muddy up the waters.
- To keep the cops away.

20:06.564 --> 20:08.651
Nice try.

20:13.699 --> 20:16.788
OK, so I'm going
to go over to Hannah's now.

20:18.247 --> 20:20.542
- Now?
- Yeah, I have a history test.

20:20.584 --> 20:22.671
- That's next Tuesday.
- Yeah.

20:22.713 --> 20:25.342
She can come over here.

20:25.383 --> 20:29.306
But she's an only child,
it's much quieter at her place.

20:29.348 --> 20:33.228
- Over at her mom's or her dad's?
- Well, her...

20:33.269 --> 20:34.772
Why?

20:34.813 --> 20:38.277
Why do I want to know
who's watching my child?

20:38.319 --> 20:41.698
I don't understand.
How do you know all this?

20:41.740 --> 20:45.537
How do you know
I have a history test next Tuesday?

20:45.579 --> 20:48.708
- Have you been reading my e-mail?
- Well...

20:48.750 --> 20:51.171
You have, haven't you?

20:51.213 --> 20:55.844
I just wanted to find out if someone
sent you things you shouldn't look at.

20:55.886 --> 20:57.554
Of course they do!

20:57.596 --> 21:01.645
I get at least ten junk e-mails
a day and I delete them all, Dad!

21:01.686 --> 21:04.899
- What else did you go through?
- You think I'm paranoid.

21:04.941 --> 21:08.738
- Hello!
- Let's just talk about this...

21:08.780 --> 21:12.202
This is going real well.
You want to read my journal, too?

21:12.244 --> 21:15.248
No. You have a journal?

21:16.667 --> 21:18.543
Unbelievable!

21:25.637 --> 21:28.350
This Yachtsman
has a taste for naked pictures.

21:28.392 --> 21:31.062
He and everyone else. Top search term?

21:31.104 --> 21:32.898
- Sex.
- Number two.

21:32.940 --> 21:38.156
- Number one is Pam Anderson.
- Pam is over 18, those girls aren't.

21:38.198 --> 21:42.955
They could be faked. Catalogue pictures,
digitally altered so they seem naked.

21:42.996 --> 21:47.168
I'd sooner hear him make
his rationalisations in person.

21:47.211 --> 21:50.466
- We don't know where he is.
- Let's trace his e-mail.

21:50.508 --> 21:54.846
He re-routes his sessions so it seems
he's logging in at a new location.

21:54.888 --> 21:57.977
- A hi-tech shell game.
- Let's make him come to us.

21:58.018 --> 22:01.314
- We know where he goes on the net.
- Teenage chat rooms.

22:01.356 --> 22:05.905
- And we know what he desires.
- Britney Spears, ten years younger.

22:05.947 --> 22:08.324
So let's give the man what he wants.

22:09.410 --> 22:14.041
Yachtsman's on, explaining to a girl
how to filch Prozac from her mother.

22:14.083 --> 22:18.423
- Talk to him.
- OK. 'My parents are so harsh.'

22:24.473 --> 22:28.020
- You got him.
- He says he like understands.

22:28.813 --> 22:30.732
'As if.'

22:31.985 --> 22:35.948
I wonder if these people wouldn't
have ever followed certain instincts.

22:35.990 --> 22:39.621
But from the privacy of your home
the forbidden is so much easier.

22:42.124 --> 22:44.043
He wants to meet in person.

22:44.085 --> 22:45.546
Where?

22:45.587 --> 22:48.801
A cafe in Chelsea, tomorrow at noon.

23:05.157 --> 23:07.035
Excuse me.

23:07.077 --> 23:09.539
Hi, I'm the Yachtsman.

23:10.582 --> 23:12.459
You must be Nicole.

23:12.501 --> 23:14.546
Actually, I'm Nicole.

23:14.587 --> 23:16.425
Let's go.

23:16.466 --> 23:19.929
You can talk to my lawyer.
That's all I'm going to say.

23:19.971 --> 23:22.892
What are you charging my client with?

23:22.934 --> 23:24.811
Soliciting a minor.

23:24.853 --> 23:29.151
I thought he solicited a 48-year-old
detective named John Munch.

23:29.192 --> 23:32.281
- He thought it was a girl of 12.
- How do you know that?

23:32.322 --> 23:36.244
You'll get a transcript
of his chat room pick-up lines.

23:36.286 --> 23:40.418
A chat room in which you and your
fellow thought police participated.

23:40.459 --> 23:42.712
But I suppose you were just working.

23:42.753 --> 23:46.050
Excuse me.
Can I have a word with you, please?

23:47.761 --> 23:50.432
- Off the record?
- Sure.

23:51.684 --> 23:56.607
Your client was discovered by a co-worker
having a fling with a 12-year-old in Cuba.

23:56.649 --> 24:00.321
- 12!
- The people that fired him said that?

24:00.363 --> 24:03.534
He quit. And his computer
was full of kiddy porn.

24:03.576 --> 24:07.582
So, I'm meant to give him less than
the best possible legal advice?

24:08.792 --> 24:12.130
- You got children, Ms Hammond?
- I have three nieces.

24:12.171 --> 24:15.135
And I understand
what you're trying to tell me,

24:15.176 --> 24:18.097
but I will not be remiss
in my duty as an attorney

24:18.139 --> 24:21.102
just because you haven't made
a credible case yet.

24:21.144 --> 24:23.814
- It'll be credible to a jury.
- Uh-huh.

24:27.569 --> 24:31.533
She'll argue that he knew he was
talking to an adult the entire time.

24:31.575 --> 24:34.036
Role-playing, fantasising, whatever.

24:34.078 --> 24:37.167
He solicited minors multiple times.
Flesh and blood.

24:37.208 --> 24:39.628
Someone's children, for God's sake!

24:39.670 --> 24:44.051
Don, I hear you. But two years ago,
I didn't know my ass from Windows 95.

24:44.093 --> 24:48.099
Cyberspace crimes
are very, very tough to prosecute.

24:50.519 --> 24:54.900
- He is a clear threat to society.
- I know, but we don't have a case.

25:00.534 --> 25:04.290
'Alt. Sex. Teens.
Father-Daughter Love Fest.'

25:04.331 --> 25:07.502
'The May-December League.'
This is what Waters does

25:07.544 --> 25:10.339
- but Eastman won't file.
- What does she want?

25:10.381 --> 25:14.929
She says a jury might go either way
on a soliciting charge so it's back to us.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.686
Forget the net. Bring me a victim
Eastman can put on the stand.

25:18.728 --> 25:22.232
- All we have was done on line.
- Besides the date with Munch,

25:22.274 --> 25:25.028
we have no proof
he contacted his little friends.

25:25.069 --> 25:28.867
- Except for the panty auctions.
- Whoa. What is this?

25:28.908 --> 25:33.541
- He bought panties from schoolgirls.
- By mail. He never bought in person.

25:33.583 --> 25:36.879
Maybe he wanted the return address
more than the panties.

25:36.920 --> 25:40.175
He bought three pairs
from a 15-year-old in Queens,

25:40.216 --> 25:42.679
shipped in a plain, brown wrapper.

25:46.225 --> 25:48.730
We want a Doris Harrington. Is she in?

25:48.771 --> 25:51.149
No. No, she's not, I'm afraid.

25:51.191 --> 25:55.740
- Are you her mother?
- I'm flattered, but I'm her grandmother.

25:55.781 --> 25:58.493
Erm... can I ask what you want or...?

25:58.535 --> 26:02.458
- Paedophilia, Mrs...?
- Harrington.

26:02.499 --> 26:04.377
Oh.

26:04.419 --> 26:07.840
Do you mind if we come in
before we all freeze to death?

26:08.966 --> 26:11.679
- Hello, ladies.
- It's the police.

26:11.721 --> 26:16.269
- High-stakes canasta?
- We're not doing anything illegal.

26:16.311 --> 26:20.233
Did I say you were?
But the vibe in here is a tad touchy.

26:20.275 --> 26:22.320
It's not easy getting old.

26:22.361 --> 26:25.492
May I see your granddaughter?
She may be in danger.

26:25.533 --> 26:28.412
Did you read the warrant, Doris?

26:29.205 --> 26:33.294
- Doris? You're Doris?
- Yes.

26:33.336 --> 26:36.673
My granddaughter's name is Elaine.
She's in school.

26:36.715 --> 26:40.054
- Ahem. May I?
- No! This isn't Russia!

26:40.095 --> 26:42.140
Shut up, Betty.

26:50.277 --> 26:54.450
Well, you've heard of
the Beardstown Ladies' Investment Club?

26:54.492 --> 26:58.121
- Hm.
- Well, we found our own niche.

26:58.163 --> 27:01.543
- Are these your granddaughter's?
- Of course.

27:01.585 --> 27:05.299
We advertise
'used homecoming queen undergarments'.

27:05.341 --> 27:08.596
- That's what we provide.
- Truth in advertising.

27:08.638 --> 27:12.392
I'm sure Parents Magazine
will award you their seal of approval.

27:15.814 --> 27:19.736
This is the first time we've had
detectives on campus this year.

27:19.778 --> 27:21.990
We pride ourselves on our security.

27:22.032 --> 27:24.368
Metal detectors can only go so far.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.287
Which is why I hired an outside firm

27:26.329 --> 27:30.002
to conduct background checks
on every teacher, janitor, cook.

27:30.044 --> 27:34.549
- That's a good start.
- Random locker searches with dogs.

27:34.591 --> 27:38.180
We enforce a strict dress code,
ban pagers and cellphones.

27:38.222 --> 27:41.977
- How about the Internet?
- We regulate Internet usage.

27:42.019 --> 27:44.982
- How?
- Software blocks certain sites.

27:45.024 --> 27:48.111
- But you know what kept happening?
- Computers crashed?

27:48.153 --> 27:53.243
A student doing a report on breast cancer
couldn't access sites featuring breasts.

27:53.285 --> 27:56.831
- Did you remove the block?
- Our students are most important.

27:56.873 --> 28:01.005
At their age, their bodies are changing.
It's sometimes scary.

28:01.047 --> 28:05.261
If one of our students wanted
to go on the net and get some info,

28:05.303 --> 28:09.351
- they have to use anatomical terms.
- And the software blocks it out.

28:09.392 --> 28:13.774
So we blocked out the software,
which maybe we shouldn't have done.

28:16.486 --> 28:19.573
Elaine, these are
Detectives Stabler and Benson.

28:19.616 --> 28:23.537
- They'd like to ask some questions.
- What did I do?

28:23.579 --> 28:26.500
We want to know if you know
a man named Harry Waters.

28:28.253 --> 28:29.672
No.

28:29.713 --> 28:32.509
On line, he's known as the Yachtsman.

28:37.433 --> 28:40.979
Elaine, are you sure
that you've never heard of him?

28:42.649 --> 28:44.401
Do you know him?

28:47.280 --> 28:49.117
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

28:49.159 --> 28:51.245
How do you know him?

28:53.164 --> 28:54.624
We...

28:56.169 --> 28:58.004
We had a thing.

28:58.046 --> 29:00.216
What kind of a thing?

29:01.301 --> 29:06.058
Why don't we go somewhere else
and talk about it, OK? Let's go.

29:07.936 --> 29:11.691
This 't.ing' between you and Waters,
when did it begin?

29:13.820 --> 29:17.533
I was just hanging around the house
one day when he came by.

29:17.575 --> 29:19.452
What was he doing there?

29:21.539 --> 29:24.417
He wanted to order more, erm...

29:24.459 --> 29:26.338
Panties?

29:26.380 --> 29:29.676
Don't worry, your grandmother
told us it was all her idea.

29:30.927 --> 29:34.224
I thought it was goofy, kind of funny.

29:36.102 --> 29:38.188
But he was really nice.

29:39.231 --> 29:42.277
He talked about his own daughter
who died in a car crash.

29:43.988 --> 29:46.074
So, he came on to you like a father?

29:49.329 --> 29:52.625
He was interested
in what I was doing in school

29:53.669 --> 29:56.590
what music I liked
and what I liked to do for fun.

29:57.633 --> 30:00.095
Did he ever ask how old you are?

30:01.430 --> 30:03.725
I told him 14.

30:03.767 --> 30:07.814
'We had already discussed
the age of innocence and all that.'

30:08.858 --> 30:10.944
Elaine, when did it become intimate?

30:14.533 --> 30:16.202
September.

30:17.245 --> 30:20.082
We met at the park, by the fountain.

30:23.880 --> 30:27.468
It was a Saturday.
There were a lot of families around.

30:29.554 --> 30:31.641
It was nice.

30:34.812 --> 30:37.148
My own dad left when I was eight.

30:41.363 --> 30:48.207
So then he took me
to this beautiful restaurant on the river.

30:50.167 --> 30:52.714
He made me feel like a princess.

30:55.467 --> 30:58.721
Elaine, did he force you
to have sex with him?

31:01.101 --> 31:04.647
No. Not really. I mean...

31:05.690 --> 31:08.695
- He did stuff to himself but...
- It's OK.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.534
- It's over now.
- It was just...

31:13.619 --> 31:17.124
The smell of him just...

31:18.375 --> 31:20.628
It reminded me of my dad.

31:32.771 --> 31:34.816
Have we got anything on this guy?

31:34.858 --> 31:37.487
He propositioned her but no actual sex.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.364
Actual sex.

31:39.406 --> 31:42.911
He flashed her. He perved her
in ways she's not even aware of.

31:46.082 --> 31:48.460
OK, how about this?

31:49.504 --> 31:53.176
He entered into an improper
relationship with a minor.

31:54.219 --> 31:58.142
You just said no real sex,
according to her story.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.645
He doesn't know that.

32:00.687 --> 32:02.773
He doesn't know what she told us.

32:03.816 --> 32:06.571
Are you suggesting we lie to the poor man?

32:06.612 --> 32:11.202
Absolutely not.
Role-playing, fantasy, make-believe.

32:11.244 --> 32:15.292
That crap he's been peddling to us
about victimless crimes.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.503
I'll have him here tomorrow morning.

32:24.179 --> 32:26.267
- Good morning.
- What's this about?

32:26.309 --> 32:28.769
My client is not answering your questions.

32:28.811 --> 32:30.856
So you said. Things change.

32:30.897 --> 32:32.984
What things?

32:34.028 --> 32:36.197
The 14-year-old's story.

32:48.174 --> 32:51.136
Different, isn't it,

32:51.178 --> 32:54.390
when you see the real victim,
not some image,

32:54.432 --> 32:56.644
but a real child with a broken heart?

32:57.687 --> 33:00.149
At least, that's what the jury will see.

33:00.190 --> 33:02.277
- Where can we talk?
- Harry?

33:02.319 --> 33:04.405
Now.

33:05.741 --> 33:09.370
Start with statutory rape,
then the lesser inclusives -

33:09.413 --> 33:13.710
soliciting, sodomy,
transporting a minor across state lines.

33:13.752 --> 33:17.424
- Transporting?
- He took her to the Jersey shore.

33:17.466 --> 33:21.180
Completely innocent.
If you go federal, I'll go to trial.

33:21.221 --> 33:23.892
- We can stay out of federal courts.
- How?

33:23.934 --> 33:27.731
Give us the names and dates
of his contacts with minors.

33:27.772 --> 33:29.816
He had one interaction, one girl.

33:29.858 --> 33:34.574
- She's the first girl we've found.
- No, he cops to one act with her.

33:34.616 --> 33:37.703
Becomes a registered sex offender.
Joins a programme.

33:37.745 --> 33:41.751
- No, he does time or we're done talking.
- Let me finish.

33:41.792 --> 33:44.338
- He has something to offer.
- Tempt us.

33:44.379 --> 33:48.595
He says he might have the names
of other men with the same affliction.

33:48.636 --> 33:53.977
- Affliction?
- Paedophilia is recognised by psychiatric...

33:54.019 --> 33:56.063
- Spare us!
- Elliot, hold on.

33:56.105 --> 33:58.859
He's got names? Other paedophiles?

33:58.901 --> 34:01.572
Nine of them. He'll deliver them in person.

34:02.656 --> 34:05.827
How much time would he serve
on sex with a minor?

34:05.869 --> 34:08.581
Five years. More with the lesser inclusives.

34:08.623 --> 34:11.668
- He takes the maximum.
- That's not a deal.

34:11.710 --> 34:13.589
Let me finish.

34:13.630 --> 34:17.344
We knock off six months
for every paedophile who's convicted.

34:17.386 --> 34:20.681
What if you screw up?
What if the jury doesn't convict?

34:20.724 --> 34:23.853
Then, he does the time
he'd be doing anyway.

34:28.444 --> 34:30.322
I'll talk to him.

34:35.871 --> 34:38.208
How did you meet the others?

34:38.250 --> 34:41.963
Well, a couple the old-fashioned way.

34:42.005 --> 34:44.051
What's that?

34:44.092 --> 34:48.223
There are certain things you say
that a child-lover understands,

34:48.264 --> 34:51.393
- that no one else would notice.
- Such as?

34:54.148 --> 34:56.360
All right. OK.

34:57.444 --> 34:59.323
First of all...

35:00.366 --> 35:04.830
say I see a guy at a roller rink,
my age, but without any kids.

35:04.872 --> 35:06.958
Just a man by himself.

35:08.586 --> 35:12.007
But the way he's watching the kids...

35:13.635 --> 35:16.430
Well, you just know.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.392
How do you make contact?

35:20.437 --> 35:21.897
Strike up a conversation.

35:21.939 --> 35:24.651
Maybe ask him about a G-rated movie.

35:26.278 --> 35:29.157
If he's like me, he's seen 'em all.

35:30.242 --> 35:32.663
So you can relate better to the kids?

35:32.704 --> 35:36.668
- Rapport is crucial.
- Like getting their sympathy

35:36.710 --> 35:41.049
with that phoney story
about your daughter's car crash?

35:41.091 --> 35:43.428
Yeah, I checked.

35:44.471 --> 35:47.893
You're talking Pocahontas
but you're really saying,

35:47.935 --> 35:49.938
'Are you a paedophile too?'

35:49.979 --> 35:52.149
That's your term, not ours.

35:53.192 --> 35:56.239
'Do you love children?' is how I put it.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.367
God, I don't believe this.

35:58.408 --> 36:01.329
You want into our world, Detective?
Believe it.

36:06.462 --> 36:09.966
- Stop hitting the computer.
- I can't get on.

36:10.008 --> 36:12.679
That's cos I put a child lock on there.

36:12.721 --> 36:16.518
- My homework's on this computer.
- OK, I'll take it off.

36:17.770 --> 36:20.107
OK, that's not working.

36:23.027 --> 36:25.114
Do you know how to fix this?

36:30.204 --> 36:32.416
Those child-lock things are a joke.

36:34.670 --> 36:37.006
- That quick, huh?
- Yes.

36:38.049 --> 36:40.470
When are you gonna start trusting me?

36:44.475 --> 36:46.353
I trust you.

36:47.397 --> 36:49.942
Sometimes I bring my work home with me.

36:49.983 --> 36:52.695
Right now, I'm chasing a guy out there in...

36:53.738 --> 36:55.784
cyberspace,

36:55.826 --> 36:58.329
who goes after little girls.

36:59.413 --> 37:02.836
You know how I lock up
all the doors and windows?

37:05.172 --> 37:07.425
Now they're coming in through there.

37:11.473 --> 37:13.351
This is about fear.

37:14.394 --> 37:16.481
This is not about trust.

37:19.902 --> 37:22.154
Stop reading my e-mail.

37:26.328 --> 37:27.788
OK.

37:28.832 --> 37:31.503
I promise.

37:31.545 --> 37:33.421
And I'm sorry.

37:41.225 --> 37:44.855
Benson, Jeffries and I
will be in the store room,

37:44.897 --> 37:48.485
off the main event,
taping and waiting until the bust.

37:48.527 --> 37:51.991
- OK. What's the signal?
- Flash the room lights twice.

37:52.032 --> 37:56.038
Munch, Stabler, you'll be in
the banquet room with the guests.

37:56.080 --> 37:59.669
- Where's the line on entrapment?
- You're just getting accounts

37:59.711 --> 38:02.923
of crimes that already occurred,
so you can say anything.

38:02.965 --> 38:07.138
- They may claim it's play-acting.
- That's why we need victims' names.

38:07.179 --> 38:11.017
We need them to say as many
specific details as possible.

38:11.059 --> 38:13.437
So we can get additional witnesses.

38:13.479 --> 38:17.861
- The tape won't convict anybody.
- What do child molesters talk about?

38:21.993 --> 38:24.538
The shopping-bag cam? Excellent.

38:24.579 --> 38:28.919
I downloaded an hour of
up-their-skirts at the shoe store.

38:28.961 --> 38:30.839
But the playground...

38:31.881 --> 38:34.260
There he is. You didn't finish the story.

38:34.301 --> 38:37.348
- You met him, where? A convention?
- Harry and me?

38:37.390 --> 38:39.476
- Yeah.
- Holiday On Ice.

38:39.935 --> 38:42.480
I prefer gymnastics.

38:42.522 --> 38:44.567
Younger girls and tight outfits.

38:44.608 --> 38:47.112
The Swedish horse. Don't get me started.

38:47.154 --> 38:50.284
You were with that little redhead.
What was her name?

38:50.325 --> 38:52.954
- Astrid?
- Astrid Brooks.

38:52.996 --> 38:56.083
Sweet 16 and the hottest babe I'd ever had.

38:57.169 --> 39:00.340
And if I never hear her name again,
I'll die a happy man.

39:00.382 --> 39:02.259
Heartbreak?

39:03.303 --> 39:05.347
She got her driver's licence.

39:05.389 --> 39:09.478
That's when I learned
I was just a glorified taxi service.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.942
- Sally Ashton.
- I had this girl, Pauline Drake.

39:12.984 --> 39:17.197
All she wanted was beer
and R-rated movies. How bad is that?

39:17.239 --> 39:20.411
- Lived in Co-op City, didn't she?
- Yeah.

39:20.452 --> 39:22.289
Astrid Brooks.

39:22.330 --> 39:24.166
Sally Ashton.

39:24.207 --> 39:26.253
And Pauline Drake.

39:27.337 --> 39:30.718
Let's give it a little time,
see if we get more bites.

39:30.759 --> 39:34.682
I just want to thank all you guys
for coming out tonight.

39:34.724 --> 39:38.562
It's always good to be
among like-minded people.

39:38.603 --> 39:40.566
To Greek philosophers.

39:41.942 --> 39:43.987
I hate to bring business into this

39:44.029 --> 39:47.324
but I have some product in my car
if anyone's interested.

39:47.366 --> 39:50.413
You'll need
a high-speed graphics equaliser.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.749
But I'm sure that won't be a problem.

39:52.791 --> 39:55.629
It's not for nothing
but those home movies you sold me

39:55.671 --> 39:58.216
look like they were shot by an eight-year-old.

39:58.258 --> 40:01.637
- Hands where we can see 'em.
- Party's over.

40:01.679 --> 40:04.767
- Up against the wall, now!
- Come on, man!

40:04.809 --> 40:08.105
- Now! Now!
- All right, come on, let's move.

40:08.147 --> 40:11.027
- Let's go, pal, slowly but quietly.
- I'm FBI.

40:11.068 --> 40:13.780
- FBI?
- Check my breast pocket.

40:21.833 --> 40:25.965
Don't you ever bad-mouth my people
in their own station house.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.050
Better get used to it.

40:28.092 --> 40:32.224
When I tell Langley how an operation
involving nine bureaus got blown,

40:32.266 --> 40:37.147
- your name is gonna be featured.
- It's spelt C-R-A-G-E-N.

40:37.189 --> 40:40.987
We were doing what we always do -
taking paedophiles off the street.

40:41.029 --> 40:43.573
Four collars
at the expense of hundreds more,

40:43.615 --> 40:46.244
who now know the cops are onto them.

40:46.286 --> 40:49.498
- It's more than you did for us.
- We were undercover!

40:49.540 --> 40:54.048
Investigating sex crimes in my city
and you didn't give me a heads-up.

40:54.089 --> 40:57.969
We're dealing with a virtual world
which is everywhere and nowhere.

40:58.011 --> 41:01.099
You've got to put real-life cuffs
on a real-life perp.

41:01.141 --> 41:06.023
It's not just you. We were in LA,
Chicago and dozens of other places.

41:06.064 --> 41:09.737
It's for the right reasons.
We wanted the big predators.

41:09.778 --> 41:12.032
So the bad guys run rings around us.

41:12.073 --> 41:13.742
Why?

41:13.783 --> 41:15.871
Because they're working together

41:16.914 --> 41:18.791
and we're not.

41:23.131 --> 41:24.884
Butterflies.

41:24.925 --> 41:27.387
Now, how cliche is that?

41:28.430 --> 41:31.518
- Delicate, short-lived...
- And easy to catch.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.230
OK, the Brooks girl.

41:34.272 --> 41:37.110
- Anyone else?
- Yes, many.

41:38.153 --> 41:41.115
The Internet opened a world of possibilities.

41:41.157 --> 41:45.915
Easy access. No more trees to climb.
No binoculars to lug around.

41:45.956 --> 41:49.544
You peek into a girl's room
with a click of your mouse.

41:49.586 --> 41:52.007
- You see?
- You see, what?

41:52.049 --> 41:55.720
You see why the children love me?
He's so cold.

41:55.762 --> 41:57.765
So angry.

41:59.893 --> 42:01.937
The kids from the bad homes,

42:01.979 --> 42:05.108
the neglected ones and the abused,

42:05.150 --> 42:09.991
when they leave the social worker's office
with their anatomically correct dolls,

42:10.033 --> 42:12.410
when they leave the police station,

42:12.452 --> 42:14.748
they're in tears.

42:16.876 --> 42:19.129
What's your point, Wallis?

42:20.215 --> 42:23.010
When they leave me

42:23.011 --> 42:24.011
they're all smiles.

42:25.305 --> 42:31.393
