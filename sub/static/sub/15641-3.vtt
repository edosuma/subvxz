00:01.210 --> 00:02.961
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor.</i>

00:03.128 --> 00:04.846
Oscar is buying you all
new uniforms.

00:05.005 --> 00:08.384
As you know, all that he asks
is that all the old ones be turned in.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.470
Out with the old, in with the new.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.390
Jelena, sometimes in life,
compromise is necessary.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.433
I shouldn't compromise on my team.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.025
Your team? I took shaking my ass in
the second row of a half-empty stadium

00:20.145 --> 00:21.943
and turned it into
a $50 million industry.

00:22.064 --> 00:23.657
This was delivered here for you.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.694
- You taking off?
- Yeah, man.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.828
- You might want to head out too, brother.
- Party just started.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.705
You partied enough last season,
don't you think?

00:30.822 --> 00:32.698
Whoa, hey. Just gonna walk by
and not give me a hug?

00:32.824 --> 00:35.543
It looks like
you've got your hands full already.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.755
- I saw her first, coach.
- Today was perfect.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.961
- Were any of the players there?
- They were around.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.376
If she finds out about this,
it'll tear her away from me

00:42.501 --> 00:43.844
just when she needs me the most.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.130
I won't tell Ahsha
that I am her father.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.845
It's one thing to perform
in front of this crowd,

00:49.007 --> 00:51.101
but to perform in front
of your daddy too?

00:51.260 --> 00:54.104
- My what?
- Pete Davenport. Your father.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.956
<i>Pete Davenport. Your father.</i>

01:33.010 --> 01:37.857
Ahsha!

01:46.315 --> 01:47.783
Where are you going?

01:56.700 --> 01:59.749
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together</i>

01:59.911 --> 02:04.087
<i>for your Los Angeles Devil Girls!</i>

04:08.457 --> 04:11.677
<i>Give it up for the Devil Girls!</i>

04:21.136 --> 04:25.357
<i>And now, Devil Nation, put your hands
together for the starting line-up.</i>

04:25.515 --> 04:29.895
<i>At forward, the Roman Emperor,
Derek Roman!</i>

04:30.020 --> 04:32.614
<i>At guard, Terrence Wall!</i>

04:38.278 --> 04:39.905
Ahsha, what are you doing here?
The game's on.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.746
Is it true?

04:47.537 --> 04:51.167
- Yes. But I can ex--
- You told me it was a one-night stand!

04:51.333 --> 04:53.802
You told me my father didn't want a kid,
couldn't take care of a kid.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.962
- You told me you didn't even know...
- I know it's confusing right now.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.723
You had him on TV!
What's so confusing about that?

04:58.882 --> 05:01.010
It's not that simple, Ahsha.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.685
That's why you were acting
so weird during tryouts.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.146
That's why you said
you'd never go back.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.437
- You were trying to keep your secret.
- Honey, please. You have to listen to me.

05:11.603 --> 05:15.733
- We can work through this together.
- You lied to me.

05:18.443 --> 05:22.164
- How could you, Mom?
- No. Ahsha, please, honey.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.199
No, no, no! Ahsha!

05:34.167 --> 05:37.762
Swing it, swing it, swing it!
Use that left hand.

05:37.921 --> 05:41.300
There you go, there you go.
Take it yourself.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.306
All right eyes Two!
D!

05:47.472 --> 05:50.021
Right now, right now, right now!
Right here!

05:55.981 --> 06:00.202
<i>And that's the half. Your Los Angeles
Devils leading 42 to 40.</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:03.239
<i>In just a few moments,
we'll be retiring the number</i>

06:03.405 --> 06:06.784
<i>of Devil great, Chase Vincent!</i>

06:10.787 --> 06:12.789
- Are they ready?
- You tell me, big man.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.918
I was born ready.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.802
Who would have thought?

06:21.965 --> 06:25.640
You in your Devil's uniform,
me in my little skirt.

06:29.848 --> 06:33.318
- We've come a <i>long</i> way.
<i>- Ladies and gentleman...</i>

06:33.476 --> 06:39.074
<i>It is with great pride
that I bring out a legend.</i>

06:39.232 --> 06:41.906
Remember what I told you
about your good side.

06:42.068 --> 06:46.039
- For the camera.
- I can't remember. Is it left or right?

06:46.197 --> 06:52.921
-It's back.
- Retired all-star, Chase Vincent!

06:55.415 --> 06:57.167
Let's hear it for him!

07:11.097 --> 07:14.101
Thank you. Thank you.

07:14.225 --> 07:18.731
I want to first thank
the love of my life,

07:18.897 --> 07:23.949
my wife and the baddest Devil Girl
to ever tear up this floor,

07:24.110 --> 07:26.613
Olivia Vincent!

07:32.577 --> 07:34.545
I also want to thank my other wife.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.878
Butch and Sundance, ten years.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.388
We played our hearts out together.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.759
Please give it up for Pete Davenport.

07:53.098 --> 07:58.480
If anyone's gonna take the Devils to
another championship, it's this man!

09:39.079 --> 09:43.209
I've been looking all over for you.
What's going on?

09:46.711 --> 09:51.012
- Ahsha, you're scaring me.
- My father.

09:52.342 --> 09:56.313
- What about your father?
- Coach Davenport.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.274
I don't get it.

10:03.728 --> 10:07.858
- But that doesn't make any sense.
- That doesn't make it not true.

10:07.982 --> 10:13.455
Damn. He was a player
while your mom was a dancer.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.449
Wow.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.252
I need to go inside.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.583
- Olivia's gonna be so mad.
- Wait, what are you talking about?

10:21.746 --> 10:24.295
I missed the dance
and Olivia's gonna fire me.

10:24.457 --> 10:28.007
- I'm gonna get in trouble.
- Look, Ahsha. You're shaking, okay?

10:28.169 --> 10:30.388
You can't deal with anybody right now.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.883
- I'm taking you home.
- I can't go home.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.347
Then I'm taking you to my place.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.389
Okay, let me drive.

10:44.269 --> 10:49.742
<i>Devils catch fire to win 99 to 97.
Thank you City of Los Angeles.</i>

10:53.778 --> 10:56.122
Great job, Charley. Really great.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.162
I thought that went great,
don't you?

11:02.328 --> 11:04.080
Minus Ahsha, what happened to her?

11:04.247 --> 11:06.545
Looks like
she couldn't take the pressure.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.131
Guess you backed the wrong horse.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.463
Timing was convenient.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.804
- What's your point?
- I think I just made it.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.855
Olivia,
tonight's performance was amazing.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.563
I thought you'd be happy.

11:25.518 --> 11:30.115
- I will find out what happened.
- You should.

11:34.569 --> 11:39.450
- If you see her, let me know.
- Absolutely.

11:49.292 --> 11:53.263
Hell, yeah, let's go! Let's go!
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

11:53.379 --> 11:56.804
Yeah, well. Yeah.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.189
Man, what's wrong with you?
We just won our first game.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.685
We won by two points, brother.
That should have been a blowout.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.900
A win's a win, bro.
Oh, a win is a win.

12:10.021 --> 12:13.366
Let's go. Let's go.
Man, let's go to the suite.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.277
Party at the suite! On me! Let's go!

12:16.444 --> 12:18.617
- What?
- Get out of the shower. It's my shower.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.748
Quote that.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.792
Vodka soda with a lemon, please.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.632
- Raquel.
- Coach Davenport.

12:29.791 --> 12:34.092
I saw you working here
the night of the kick-off party.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.929
- You should have said something.
- That was a...

12:38.091 --> 12:41.686
That was a busy night.
But congrats on the new gig.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.597
Congratulations on the win.
I watched it in the back.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.313
Well, it was closer
than it should have been.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.024
It must have been
a little weird for you, though,

12:50.186 --> 12:52.655
-watching the girls dancing.
- Yeah.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.784
- A lot is weird right now.
- Jesse?

12:57.443 --> 12:59.445
Oh, it's a small world. People talk.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.665
It's okay.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.956
He bulldozes me for more time
with my son

13:06.119 --> 13:08.497
and then he doesn't spend
any of it with him.

13:08.621 --> 13:13.468
He just pawns him off on whatever
chick he happens to be sleeping with.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.548
-It's just...
- Agents are pieces of...

13:19.007 --> 13:21.385
Well, they're not nice people.

13:23.803 --> 13:28.274
I'm struggling with some legal matters
of my own right now.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.401
My wife.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.989
You can't roll over, Raquel.
You have to fight.

13:35.106 --> 13:38.280
How do you fight someone
with a million dollar lawyer?

13:38.443 --> 13:40.992
You can't fight an Uzi
with a butter knife.

13:41.154 --> 13:46.081
Well, I'm gonna give you
a nuclear bomb.

13:47.160 --> 13:52.007
This is the best attorney in the country.
Tell her I sent you.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.760
- Is this your divorce attorney?
- Nope, it's my wife's.

13:55.918 --> 14:00.924
- She's way better.
- Thank you.

14:07.555 --> 14:11.731
- There's a ton of players here already.
- We can't date Devils.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.737
- There are some from other teams.
- Hot damn!

14:14.896 --> 14:17.445
Dibs on the tallest guy in the room.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.156
Honey, if you only go after
the tallest guy in the room,

14:20.318 --> 14:22.571
you'll end up talking all night
to someone's freak show cousin

14:22.737 --> 14:25.081
from Ohio
who paints houses for a living.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.376
Tall doesn't mean they ball.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.510
How do we know who's a baller?

14:37.668 --> 14:40.046
By his clothes, shoes, his watch.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.557
Is he wearing Audemar
or a diamond Piaget?

14:42.715 --> 14:46.561
Leather or chinchilla?
Margiela or Gaultier?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.224
The devil is in the details.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.329
Heaven's earth.
Now, here's the rarest of all breeds.

15:12.495 --> 15:16.295
- A baller with no bling.
- How do you know?

15:16.457 --> 15:18.710
The Fob. He drives an Aston Martin.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.504
Wait, that's the Serbian guy
who plays for Boston.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.971
They just signed him for 3O million.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.637
Yahtzee! School's out, girls.

15:28.803 --> 15:32.273
Hi, I'm Kyle.
What's your name?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.436
- Pavle.
- Pavle?

15:35.601 --> 15:38.445
That's a sexy name. It's strong.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.981
Are you strong, Pavle?

15:43.109 --> 15:47.159
- Come again?
Basketball.

15:51.242 --> 15:54.166
You don't speak English.

15:54.328 --> 15:58.458
It's okay, honey.
I'm gonna have a blast with you.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.294
Come on.

16:14.849 --> 16:19.104
Yo, I'm missing a red in here.
Somebody get me a redhead.

16:24.192 --> 16:29.039
Look at this fool. I swear to God,
if he blows another season for me...

16:29.197 --> 16:31.575
It's a party, Terrence.
Just try to have fun.

16:31.741 --> 16:35.621
Yeah, maybe I should go stand in
the hot tub with just my junk covered.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.747
That's not possible.

16:37.914 --> 16:42.465
You'd need way more suds than that.
Dance with me.

16:45.463 --> 16:48.512
Okay, who can shake it the fastest?
You turn around, right here.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.676
All right, all right, now you.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.972
Oh, my God, what is happening here?

17:06.275 --> 17:09.575
- You told her?
- Sloane? What?

17:10.863 --> 17:13.161
- I didn't tell Ahsha anything.
- How did she find out, then?

17:13.324 --> 17:14.997
She knows?

17:17.244 --> 17:19.373
We had a huge fight
and she left upset

17:19.539 --> 17:22.291
and I've been calling her
and looking for her everywhere

17:22.458 --> 17:24.756
and I'm just praying
she's with her boyfriend.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.724
Sit down.
Come on, sit down. Just sit down.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.510
Sit down, okay?

17:39.016 --> 17:43.487
I know this isn't how you wanted it,
but...

17:43.646 --> 17:46.274
How could she have found out?

17:48.192 --> 17:51.366
Maybe you and I should sit down
and talk to Ahsha together.

17:51.529 --> 17:55.579
No. I can handle it.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.874
Well, you know you don't have
to handle everything, Sloane.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.664
- You never did.
- I'm not a martyr, Pete.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.505
I didn't leave and raise her on my own
because I wanted to.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.886
- I did that because I had to.
- So you say.

18:07.044 --> 18:10.344
- You say what?
- You didn't have to do it alone.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.307
Okay, you could have told me
that I had a child.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.348
Told you and then what?
Chased you from city to city,

18:14.510 --> 18:16.103
bed to bed,
trying to make you be a father?

18:16.220 --> 18:18.143
You didn't give me a chance.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.362
Hey, you know her.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.079
What do you think
she's gonna do next?

18:34.739 --> 18:39.245
For the first time in my life,
I don't know.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.801
Your hand fits around my entire thigh.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.311
Do you see that, Pavle?

18:57.470 --> 19:02.727
You're like King Kong and I'm like
that tiny little blonde girl in your hand.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.611
You're also, in America,
what we call a hot mess.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.943
Hot mess?

19:08.064 --> 19:10.817
You're a baller
but you don't look like one.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.615
But don't worry, sweetheart,
I'm gonna fix you.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.168
Lesson one, Pavle.

19:21.327 --> 19:25.753
Can you say cha-ching?

19:25.915 --> 19:29.135
- Cha-c:hing?
- Cha-ching.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.672
Yes! Yes! Cha-ching!

19:32.838 --> 19:37.344
You learn fast, Pavle.
You're so cute. Yes, you are.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.815
What the hell?
That's my security deposit!

19:42.973 --> 19:45.226
Whoa! You can afford
to pay for it, man.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.816
Man, I ain't about to pay
for this drunk!

19:47.978 --> 19:50.948
- Yo!
- Take off.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.704
It's getting real old
cleaning up your messes, man.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.543
Let's go, Jelena.

20:15.256 --> 20:20.262
Yo, what the hell are you all standing
around for? Turn the music up.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.317
He's like a child.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.202
Babe, if you don't like Derek,
just get rid of him.

20:37.361 --> 20:41.616
- Jelena, it is not that simple.
-Isn't it?

20:44.160 --> 20:47.039
Whatever you're doing
isn't working.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.548
You obviously need
to do something different.

20:51.625 --> 20:55.346
You know, I had a big day too.

20:55.463 --> 20:59.343
- Where's my celebration.
- I know. I know.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.727
I'm sorry.

21:02.970 --> 21:07.316
I have been a bad boyfriend.

21:07.475 --> 21:10.820
Very, very bad.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.273
How can I make it up to you?

22:01.111 --> 22:03.910
How many times have you
and I talked about him?

22:04.073 --> 22:07.668
If I had his nose,
his ears, his chin,

22:07.785 --> 22:11.710
what he did for a living,
what city he lived in...

22:12.957 --> 22:14.925
Babe, you need sleep.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.883
What I need is a brick
upside the head.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.144
I need to go speak to Olivia.

22:29.265 --> 22:32.439
I can't even imagine
what she's gonna say to me.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.353
Actually, I can.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.194
Your mom left me
four voicemails and eight texts.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.984
I'm not talking to her.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.413
- She's your mom, Ahsha.
- I'm not talking to her.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.328
Well, what do you want me to tell her
next time she calls?

22:52.496 --> 22:54.498
Tell her whatever you want.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.732
Let's go.

23:13.183 --> 23:16.778
- What are you doing here?
- We have practice.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.331
- You here to give me another lecture?
- Nope.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.833
I'm here to help you get dressed.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.984
- Morning, beautiful.
- Morning.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.148
Uh-oh. What's that look?

24:02.483 --> 24:08.286
Oh, I... I have to let
someone go today. Ahsha Hayes.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.370
Sloane's daughter?

24:10.532 --> 24:13.752
Mm-hm. She completely missed
the performance last night.

24:13.911 --> 24:16.130
I haven't heard from her since.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.632
That's too bad.
You and Sloane go way back.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.049
So, what are you gonna do today,
baby?

24:24.463 --> 24:28.093
Now that your jersey's retired,
I'm guessing mimosas, golf clubs,

24:28.258 --> 24:31.387
sitting on the porch swing with your
pants pulled up to your shoulders,

24:31.553 --> 24:34.272
just reminiscing
about the good, old days.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.519
That's cute.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.860
Well, meetings. I got to pump up
these business deals,

24:41.981 --> 24:45.235
keep this fabulous life
we got here going.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.824
Keeping Olivia Vincent in shoes
is no joke.

24:47.945 --> 24:50.323
Me and Mr Louis Vuitton, thank you.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.118
- That is weird.
- What?

24:54.284 --> 24:57.584
Mia. I just got an email from her
with a telephone number.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.748
- Mia?
- Yeah, remember that dancer,

24:59.915 --> 25:02.464
the one who took off
right before the tryouts?

25:06.380 --> 25:09.008
Two words, girl drama.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.853
- Have a good day, hon.
- Thanks, babe.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.334
Hi.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.803
How could you judge tryouts,

25:50.966 --> 25:54.561
go through that whole thing
and not say one word to me?

25:54.720 --> 25:56.688
I just found out too.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.653
Ahsha...

26:04.188 --> 26:07.362
I know you want to be angry
with your mother right now.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.652
I want to be angry
with your mother.

26:11.070 --> 26:14.119
But it was more complicated
than that.

26:16.617 --> 26:20.963
You know, just... because two people
love each other, it doesn't mean--

26:21.121 --> 26:23.123
You loved each other?

26:24.917 --> 26:27.466
Well, yeah.

26:27.628 --> 26:32.225
So, how do you go
from loving each other to this?

26:36.178 --> 26:37.976
I have to go.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.902
Olivia?

26:57.783 --> 27:01.413
- I know you're mad.
- Do you?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.421
In all my years
with this organisation,

27:06.542 --> 27:09.887
no dancer has ever blown off
a performance like that.

27:11.213 --> 27:15.684
I cut you slack during the auditions,
I gave you a second chance,

27:15.843 --> 27:17.470
but, Ahsha...

27:19.471 --> 27:21.098
Ahsha, this is unforgivable.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.726
- Olivia, please don't--
- You did this, not me.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.644
- You don't understand.
- You're right. I don't.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.108
- Please.
- You know what?

27:27.271 --> 27:29.194
I have 100 other more
important things to do right now.

27:29.356 --> 27:32.781
- Go clean out your locker.
- Pete Davenport is my dad.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.282
What did you just say?

27:39.950 --> 27:43.170
I literally found out right there,
right before we were supposed to go out.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.830
- I didn't know--
- Sloane told you right bef--

27:44.997 --> 27:46.999
She didn't.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.759
Neither of them told me.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.507
I would never miss a performance.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.302
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
than on that floor.

28:01.889 --> 28:04.233
No, I understand that.

28:06.185 --> 28:10.691
- Can I stay on the team?
- Of course, yes.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.693
WhY don't you go get changed?

28:18.947 --> 28:23.373
I don't want people talking about me,
about this.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.879
Can you not say anything to anyone?

28:27.539 --> 28:30.133
- Sure.
- Thank you.

28:37.883 --> 28:43.265
V-E-R-S-A-C-E, Versace.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.228
- Versace.
- Yes!

28:47.935 --> 28:50.779
One piece of fancy for you

28:50.938 --> 28:54.283
and two pieces of fancy for me.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.445
And that's what we call
a three-point play.

28:57.611 --> 29:01.741
Oh, ring this up and double-bag it.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.492
Come on, baby.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.338
Honey, these girls
don't understand you like I do.

29:12.501 --> 29:17.098
Basketball.
- Yes. Basketball.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.054
You're gonna need to use
the metal file on him.

29:19.216 --> 29:20.763
I think he grew up in the woods.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.272
Hey.
You weren't on the floor at the game.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.653
- Missed a hell of an after party too.
- Too bad.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.735
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Roadrunner.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.649
I need to get to rehearsal.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.784
I don't need to give Olivia
another reason to fire me.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.199
- Two points.
- Make them.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.490
No, that's how many points I scored
in my first professional game.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.533
Four quarters, two points.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.248
Wow, you sucked.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.755
That is exactly
what the commentator said

29:49.913 --> 29:51.836
during the game
and, like, two hours after.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.501
You haven't lived
until you've had Charles Barkley

29:53.667 --> 29:57.092
re-enact all your blown plays
with finger puppets and a laugh track.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.757
- That never happened.
- Okay, I could be exaggerating.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.142
But he did rip me to shreds.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.099
Is your misery supposed
to be cheering me up?

30:04.261 --> 30:07.481
- You want to know who was at the game?
- Okay, this really isn't cheering me up.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.859
Charles Barkley.
He didn't come to make fun of me.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.691
He came to watch me play.

30:12.853 --> 30:16.278
Look, Ahsha, it's not how you start.
It's how you finish.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.117
Thanks.

30:21.862 --> 30:24.706
So am I gonna see you shaking
that juicy thing at the next game?

30:25.949 --> 30:28.168
You never disappoint me,
Derek Roman.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.708
Jelena.

30:36.501 --> 30:37.969
A word.

30:44.676 --> 30:49.147
I don't know how you found out,
but I know you told Ahsha.

30:49.264 --> 30:53.440
- More Ahsha.
- And I know why.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.357
I get you, Jelena.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.195
- Better than you think I do.
- Do you?

31:05.280 --> 31:07.908
I also know Ahsha doesn't want
any more people knowing her business.

31:08.075 --> 31:12.831
So if I hear of one person
talking about it around here...

31:15.165 --> 31:16.917
It won't be good.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.886
Is that a threat?

31:23.173 --> 31:25.221
Call it what you want.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.317
- Go, go, go!
- I got the first pass.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.281
Drop off, drop off. My pass. My pass.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.821
- Come on, pass.
- Finish!

31:45.987 --> 31:48.661
Go, go, go!

31:54.204 --> 31:56.252
All right. Good job.
That's it. Bring it in.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.965
- Good finish. Good finish.
- Good job. Here we go.

32:02.546 --> 32:04.674
Looked like Pete Davenport.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.639
No, I'm good with that.
But it's still too Hollywood.

32:07.801 --> 32:10.304
- Just make a clean pass.
- You threw that pass.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.985
Hey, yo. Let me see the rock.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.361
We running drills or what?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.203
All right.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.332
Oh, what you got? Good shot.

32:58.393 --> 33:01.863
- You fun girlfriend.
- Oh, honey.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.109
That's the one English word
I don't know.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.448
When I walk through the doors
of that locker room with

33:07.611 --> 33:11.787
all these shopping bags, you are gonna
have girls coming out of your ears.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.750
Oh, call me
if you're ever back in town.

33:29.299 --> 33:33.395
- This one is on me.
- On you?

33:33.553 --> 33:35.772
I met with that attorney.
You were right.

33:35.931 --> 33:39.231
She's a pit bull in a skirt.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.394
I have more rights
than I thought I did.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.655
Well, it looks like Jesse
is in for a fight.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.569
- Thank you, Coach Davenport.
- Would you call me Pete?

33:50.445 --> 33:54.700
- Thanks, Pete.
- You're welcome.

34:19.975 --> 34:23.275
Some of you
are clearly somewhere else.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.859
Take ten. Pull yourselves together.

34:32.027 --> 34:34.030
Hello, Ahsha.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.824
I'm learning people aren't
who they say they are.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.335
I'm learning to look out for myself.

34:39.494 --> 34:42.839
You were my idol.
You're not anymore.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.418
I thought you knew about Pete.

34:48.378 --> 34:51.632
I didn't know
it was gonna be this big soap opera.

34:51.797 --> 34:56.099
I only have one father, so you can't
drop that bomb on me again.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.807
New arena plans are stalling.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.143
Gonna need a chainsaw
to get through this red tape.

35:44.392 --> 35:48.898
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Mia.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.114
She's reaching out.
She emailed Olivia.

35:54.653 --> 35:59.500
Finding that uniform's turning out to be
a bigger pain in the ass than I thought.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.286
We need to find out where she is.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.332
Already done.

36:34.401 --> 36:37.780
- Your mom called again.
- Just turn off your ringer.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.783
Ahsha, you should at least call her
and let her know that you're okay.

36:40.949 --> 36:43.327
I'm with you. She knows I'm okay.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.587
Okay.

36:47.914 --> 36:50.133
I'm lying.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.293
You're like a hermit, all right?

36:52.460 --> 36:55.714
You've been sitting on this couch
for the last six hours, babe.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.599
- You need to get up.
- You're kicking me out?

37:00.301 --> 37:03.180
No, but this has to stop.

37:03.346 --> 37:06.145
You telling me to tell her whatever?

37:06.266 --> 37:11.989
I'm not asking you to give her
a fruit basket, okay?

37:12.147 --> 37:15.151
I'm just saying
go handle your business.

37:16.568 --> 37:20.789
It's not for me to tell her whatever.
It's for you to tell her whatever.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.325
So go.

37:23.491 --> 37:26.244
Tell her whatever.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.488
Ahsha.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.622
Say something.

38:08.077 --> 38:09.829
I'm moving out.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.382
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor.</i>

38:20.548 --> 38:24.894
When you're shooting the calendar,
lots of hot, sexy bikini nakedness?

38:25.053 --> 38:26.350
I'm gonna make love
to that camera so hard,

38:26.513 --> 38:28.231
it's gonna need a cigarette
and a pregnancy test after.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.892
If you want to dig up the bones from
that night, it's not gonna happen.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.357
- We used to be friends.
- We used to be best friends.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.863
- I thought you just--
- No, no, no.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.949
You're not talking right now.
I'm talking, you're listening.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.489
Did you have anything to do with me
losing my spot on the team?

38:40.652 --> 38:42.279
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.789
So, what do you think of the house?

38:44.906 --> 38:47.159
Guess who learned
how to be sexy today?

38:47.325 --> 38:49.919
Hello? Mia?
