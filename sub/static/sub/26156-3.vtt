00:02.000 --> 00:04.120
Lionel Dirkin was grooming
ex-soldiers to commit

00:04.120 --> 00:05.400
a series of attacks.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.640
Nobody had heard of her a week ago
and now she could win.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.200
It's Beckett. If you hadn't of
chased me, she wouldn't be dead.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.040
Caddy lied about not knowing
Beckett.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.800
They were stationed
at Basra together.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.560
Caddy's the only way we
can catch him.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.200
She's pregnant.
Meet your new handler.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.240
Faye, Albion,
they still suspect me,

00:19.240 --> 00:20.920
but Dennis thinks
I'm his golden goose.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.120
Drop the surveillance then he'll
have to trust me more

00:23.120 --> 00:27.120
and then he'll have to act.

00:27.160 --> 00:31.160
Ma'am wants to know why we've
removed surveillance off of Albion.

00:32.159 --> 00:36.160
Well, strategically, ma'am, because
I asked the undercover officer

00:37.280 --> 00:40.200
to spark the rumour there was a mole
in the Albion Organisation.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.760
Well, something needed shaking up.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.720
We've got Beckett laughing
in our public faces,

00:43.720 --> 00:45.440
and all we can see is his arse!

00:45.440 --> 00:47.920
OK, fair do's. Go on.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.160
Well, if we had a reliable mole,
why would we need surveillance?

00:51.160 --> 00:52.840
And in the absence of information,

00:52.840 --> 00:56.200
we desperately need Dennis Caddy
relying more on his girlfriend.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.400
On the eve of an election,
they remove cover

00:58.400 --> 01:02.000
on their only suspects
in the unsolved death...

01:04.840 --> 01:06.800
Go to pages five, six
seven, eight and nine.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.400
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- Nobody's touching that stuff!

01:10.400 --> 01:12.160
You need to leave now,
the pair of you.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.560
Put the cat down!

01:13.560 --> 01:15.800
Back in your boxes! Calm down. Calm!

01:15.800 --> 01:18.000
Calm right down, please.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.640
My fault, fellas.
I intended in pre-warning them.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.600
This task is being
done at my request.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.720
Joy's desk is coming in my office.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.680
Yeah, but it's not a shrine.
We're here to work.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.160
And it will be worked at.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.800
And I'm taking no personal effects,

01:30.800 --> 01:33.800
any used hankies, pictures
of cats, they're team property.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.980
Your team.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.040
Ma'am.

01:39.040 --> 01:43.040
We have just taken a report of
a homicide at the Jewish Cemetery.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.360
Thank you very much.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.560
Right, where's my wedges?

01:49.560 --> 01:53.560
Come on, wedges,
let's have the fellas.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.000
Right, so we've got chicken liver,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.760
bacon and double-fried wedges.
Â£4.85.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.200
What are you drinking?

02:03.200 --> 02:05.600
There's enough vouchers on
there for a beverage and all,

02:05.600 --> 02:09.600
so I will have a coke.

02:10.479 --> 02:12.160
12p short.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.260
Can't be!

02:17.560 --> 02:19.160
Then what happened?

02:19.160 --> 02:20.760
You can't pay for it now,

02:20.760 --> 02:22.920
you'll have to earn it on the card.

02:22.920 --> 02:26.920
- Fine! Have the cash.
- I will. Thanks.

02:27.640 --> 02:31.240
So this old man and a little girl
walk into a forest,

02:31.240 --> 02:33.200
and she goes, "Oh, I'm scared."

02:33.200 --> 02:37.200
He goes, "You're scared?
I've got to walk home on my own."

02:37.520 --> 02:41.520
Hey, smile, your next
scran's covered.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.120
You're blocking me passage ladies,
excuse me.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.000 --> 03:05.680
A friend of mine wants a word,
professor.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.240
Mate of Faye Caddy?
I don't think so.

03:08.240 --> 03:12.240
With breath like that,
you really should drink more water.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.760
You see, now you're giving me bonus
balls for the paternity claim.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.860
I've said from year dot,
"How's that my kid?"

03:40.320 --> 03:43.120
You go anywhere near my daughter,
you pointless bitch,

03:43.120 --> 03:44.640
I'll split you in two.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.520
- You what?
- No sexual reference intended.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.280
Like you still could.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.680
We caught her in a school
rehearsal for Bugsy.

03:52.680 --> 03:56.680
She was trying to be Tallulah.
She was nearly great.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.720
Someone on our side has been
talking to yours.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.560
We've got a mole
and I want its name.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.640
You won't get it from me.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.800
I meant,
we're the science department,

04:09.800 --> 04:12.400
we specifically don't get access
to strategic intelligence.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.320
Technically, we know less
than fuck all.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.959
We've spent our whole lives bringing
The Albion into this century.

04:17.959 --> 04:21.120
- You reckon?
- And no shitty rat is going to bring it down.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.400
You see, now I'm confused.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.320
Is it a rat or a mole
I'm looking for?

04:24.320 --> 04:27.480
I just need to know
if it's black or white.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.880
- Here's a number.
- Use it.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.560
You're cleaning that up, Santa!

05:14.560 --> 05:16.120
I'm with the police.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.280
Course you are!

05:18.480 --> 05:20.380
Do they let anybody in?

05:39.480 --> 05:41.040
Who called this in as a murder,
Moss?

05:41.040 --> 05:42.600
A paper lad's mum walking their dog.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.280
One of my men are
still interviewing her.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.440
Yeah, well, tell them to
leave that to us now, thanks.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.520
I meant, calming her down so
she's fit to speak to

05:48.520 --> 05:49.920
by the time you need to.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.520
You need to pipe that lot right
down.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.200
Shouting Beckett's name's
not helpful.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.040
Not catching him is not helpful,
inspector. And maybe they're right -

05:56.040 --> 05:58.520
election day - this has got Beckett
all over it.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.160
I was brought up on a farm.
This is a fox's work.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.080
I was brought up in a
textile factory.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.560
- It could have been a chainsaw.
- We're not coroners!

06:06.560 --> 06:08.800
Meanwhile, seven violated graves

06:08.800 --> 06:12.800
and you didn't respond
to a single report.

06:12.920 --> 06:16.520
Hey, Moss, mate.
We logged all that.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.200
On those occasions, no-one was hurt.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.920
Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.360
But then...

06:23.360 --> 06:27.000
OK, OK, but standing there
shouting unsupportable tripe...

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
- Can I say tripe?
- You're asking an Asian.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.840
This lot are making themselves
a target for any lunatic who

06:32.840 --> 06:36.200
- fancies a pop.
- Look, Moss! Just shift him. Please.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.520
Before we have to.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.840
- When you put it like that.
- Thank you.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.320
All right, folks, can we move
right back please? Right back.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.040
We're declaring this all
a crime scene, OK?

06:46.040 --> 06:48.600
So let's go, let's move right back.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.320
So if we can't catch him because
it's your fault,

06:51.320 --> 06:53.920
then it'll be your fault.
Let's go.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.560
That wasn't just a bunch of birds,
they were with Faye Caddy and

07:04.560 --> 07:07.040
they had it planned, and they
must have waited it out a fuck of a

07:07.040 --> 07:09.760
long time because even I didn't know
I was coming in here till I did.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.520
This cost serious money,
it's more than Faye Caddy's asking.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.560
Look, give us Lena's service
provider,

07:14.560 --> 07:17.000
- we'll run it through the system.
- They changed contracts.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.600
- She'll be under her mother's account.
- Well, give us Shirley's.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.600
I cannot remember her maiden name.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.200
All I'm getting is Blackpool and
that's not a recollection,

07:26.200 --> 07:28.000
it's a judgment on her mam and dad.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.920
OK, Miller, relax, Shirley's safely
in a car on the way to the station.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.080
Shirley?
On her own?

07:33.080 --> 07:34.920
What the negligent fucking...!

07:34.920 --> 07:36.920
We're not talking about Shirley!

07:36.920 --> 07:40.920
Nobody had a picture of fucking
Shirley, did they? Where's Lena?

07:41.480 --> 07:44.460
The headmistress is driving
her in personally.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.320
- What the fuck, Miller?!
- What, you don't say that first?

07:48.320 --> 07:51.040
No, it's just come through
on me comms, you knob!

07:52.040 --> 07:54.240
- Right, this is evidence.
- Good, we'll need it.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.360
All three suspects have got
the same description -

07:56.360 --> 08:00.320
fat and mouthy, that's half of
Manchester.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.240
You swerving the lifts to avoid me,
Viv?

08:02.240 --> 08:05.800
- No, I've just been to the cemetery.
- Stairs count as fresh air.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.000
I heard.
Could it have been Beckett?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Beckett always leaves
his scraggy mark.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I don't think this is big
enough for him.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.680
Election day not big enough?

08:14.680 --> 08:17.160
If he's after disrupting
factions at our expense,

08:17.160 --> 08:19.480
then weren't the Jews just
waiting to be asked?

08:19.480 --> 08:22.560
Miller's family have just taken
a threat to two of their lives.

08:22.560 --> 08:26.040
- From who? - Faye Caddy is the only
name we've flagged up, as yet.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.520
All the others are TBC.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.560
The point being that
we've just proved a circuit.

08:30.560 --> 08:34.039
Albion don't know who the mole is,
hence the threat to Miller.

08:34.039 --> 08:37.320
How can that not be a result,
Marilyn?!

08:37.320 --> 08:39.799
Oh, and with your permission,

08:39.799 --> 08:43.400
we've upped resources to cover
the election count tonight, yeah?

08:43.400 --> 08:46.360
Well, send us a budget for approval
and choose your words carefully.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.680
I did. You have?
It's spent.

08:49.680 --> 08:53.280
If Beckett has been in
Abel Lander's home ahead of you,

08:53.280 --> 08:55.440
then I would suggest
additional protection,

08:55.440 --> 08:59.440
with additional funding that
I would approve before expenditure.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.440
I've made it my mission to stop
you looking like such a bad girl

09:03.440 --> 09:05.040
on paper all of the time.

09:10.280 --> 09:14.000
- Miller, you OK, kid?
- They're nearly here.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.120
Come here, come here.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.360
They are, and they're safe.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.520
I am so sorry that your family
had to take a hit.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.000
But this will have to be short-lived
as down-time.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.800
I need you at
Bailey Street Mortuary.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.800
Abel Landers, 78.
It's a controversial death.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.760
- What the heck you wearing?!
- It's from Sammy upstairs.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.320
- It's all I could find.
- It's all right, I've done it before.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.760
You'll look like a lovely taxpayer
in front of Shirley.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.520
- Oh, my God, darling!
- Daddy!

09:42.520 --> 09:46.040
Sorry, love, that's my fault.
Sorry, sweetheart.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.640
Come on, lads, let's give
them a minute.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.820
Mum doesn't want to talk to you.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.240
Yeah, well, that didn't
need saying, did it?

09:57.240 --> 09:59.680
She asked me to repeat it so she
knew you wouldn't go barging

09:59.680 --> 10:03.380
- into your chief inspector's office.
- What, she's there?

10:04.320 --> 10:08.200
Somebody needs to give
me some facts now.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.880
OK, you were called Lena because
neither me or your mum could

10:10.880 --> 10:14.880
stand up straight when you
were conceived. That's one fact.

10:18.880 --> 10:22.840
Look,
bad people threatened me today.

10:22.840 --> 10:26.800
Well, that's only half true,
otherwise, why are we here?

10:26.800 --> 10:30.280
They threatened me and mine.

10:30.280 --> 10:34.280
But I swear to you, Lena, I am going
to put these fuckers in their place.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.480
Nobody's sworn since you left.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.400
There's one for you,
there's one for your mam.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.000
The location's scrambled.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.640
You choose a last minute holiday
destination - one where there's

10:53.640 --> 10:55.960
barely any signal,
just until the election dies down.

10:55.960 --> 10:59.440
You and her, you have to be saying
the exact same thing, you hear?

10:59.440 --> 11:01.680
And these will not send pictures,

11:01.680 --> 11:05.680
so the only risk of giving away
your location is that.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.060
Right, I mean hers, not yours.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.360
Look after yourself.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.560
Yeah, I will.

11:17.560 --> 11:21.560
I know it's rude to squeeze,
but I want what your dad can do.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.140
Go on.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.040
I need to know
what Lander's death is.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.560
Well, it'll have to be
another Skype, ma'am,

11:32.560 --> 11:35.240
- cos I've a lot to answer for today.
- Another Skype?

11:35.240 --> 11:38.800
How many causes of death have you
done down the line?

11:49.240 --> 11:50.800
Dennis's shifting money around.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.480
It's coming into the house
in used bundles, not from a bank,

11:53.480 --> 11:54.840
must be donors.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.320
What kind of money?

11:56.320 --> 11:58.480
I'm counting nearly 40 grand.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.120
That's usually
about the price of a hit.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.160
For Beckett to finish the job
on Caroline McCoy?

12:02.160 --> 12:05.720
He killed a cop,
why's it not a bonus?

12:05.720 --> 12:08.520
There's a suspected homicide
at the Jewish Cemetery this morning.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.680
Nah, I'd have heard chatter
if it was sponsored.

12:10.680 --> 12:14.280
Hello?

12:16.600 --> 12:18.080
Hello?

12:18.080 --> 12:20.520
I'm average looks.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.960
Pretty good shape.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.800
But really well hung.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.800
Right y'are. Can but ask.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.220
Go on.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.320
I've been asked to pack for
a departure.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.560
To where?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.800
It's usually Ireland,
so that's Holyhead initially.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.200
Point being,
all phones are to be left behind.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.520
- Categorically, I cannot wear a wire.
- Dennis is the only one

12:49.520 --> 12:51.640
Beckett trusts to
deliver the wages personally?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.280
More than like, yes.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.640
So we follow the money.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.760
You do fuck! You follow me.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.560
I'm heading into a wilderness
with no means of communication.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.920
You follow us.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.400
You made yourself my handler, Dinah.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.400
I need handling.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.480
Everyone stay back,
until we establish no booby traps.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.180
If Beckett's been here,
we need to know.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.160
Don't move.

13:27.960 --> 13:28.960
Clear!

13:30.360 --> 13:32.800
What the hell are you doing
in there? What's your name?

13:32.800 --> 13:34.680
Sharania Kimbel. Shaz.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.040
I was having a last chance
at remembering him.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.200
And this.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.280
I thought he'd have let the flat go
after Clemmy died, but no,

13:41.280 --> 13:42.960
the paintwork looks new.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.160
Good man. God bless.

13:45.160 --> 13:49.160
I asked for a nappy half an hour
ago. Now it's over to you.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.400
Ma'am, this lady needs a bathroom,
sharpish!

13:52.400 --> 13:55.120
Let 'em all through. OK,
clear a space for this lady, folks,

13:55.120 --> 13:57.360
or cover your feet!
That's it, thank you.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.440
He's got a Specials badge.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.960
What's the face for, Mal?

14:07.960 --> 14:10.600
The deal, Inspector, where
we tell you absolutely everything

14:10.600 --> 14:14.520
when we're heading into something,
is meant to be reciprocal.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.880
You've crossed the line today.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.120
You failed to disclose something
you must've known.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.880
Abel Lander has five charges of
tampering against his name.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.000
There is no room for mithering here.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.760
I'm not having you just telling us
what you think we need to know

14:25.760 --> 14:27.080
in order to protect your own.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.600
Five complaints,

14:28.600 --> 14:31.560
all by the same complainant
because she's off her tits.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.720
Diana Bagel.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.120
No, no. She's Diana Bagel.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.680
And for your information, Inspector,
the charges were totally overblown.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.960
He's had a stack to deal with,
old Mr Lander.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.680
He never got over his wife.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.280
He never lived on his own
in his life.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.800
He kept it spotless
in case she was watching.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.840
He was counting the days
he'd be with her.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.760
But he was strong as an ox.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.520
He was going nowhere soon that
I could see, not physically anyway.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.200
From the telly,
"You've never had Sky."

14:58.200 --> 15:00.880
From the toilet, "Respect your
friends, wipe your arse."

15:00.880 --> 15:02.720
From the back of the door,

15:02.720 --> 15:04.960
"Got your kecks on, Abel?"

15:04.960 --> 15:07.600
He occasionally forgot his trousers.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.480
Like he forgot many other things.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.000
Only one lunatic persecuted him.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I only ever saw the shorts.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.800
He never had his meat out
to my knowledge.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.640
Sorry, Ma'am.
I was in the manager's office.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.840
She got past us.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.320
How are you getting Disability
if you can shift like a rat?!

15:22.320 --> 15:24.000
There's a dress coat of mine
in there,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.920
I never dared ask it for back
after she died.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.200
You'll know it's mine,
it's got my name in it.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.280
Just from the chatter,
we're convinced Albion

15:30.280 --> 15:31.640
had nothing to do with Lander.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.120
That doesn't mean Beckett didn't.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.280
Chatter, where?

15:34.280 --> 15:36.520
Can we clear the room for a guest,
please?

15:36.520 --> 15:39.080
Ah, Jesus!
If it's her mum again,

15:39.080 --> 15:43.080
we haven't time for fucking
broken biscuit jigsaws.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.440
Most of you know Moss.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.320
- He's here to help.
- With respect, Ma'am,

15:49.320 --> 15:51.680
we're limited to what we can say
in front of civilians.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.720
C'mon, Spike.
Moss's got a Specials Badge.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.560
And 45% of all Shomrim call-outs
are for non-Jewish populations.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.480
You're welcome.

16:00.480 --> 16:04.440
Fancy a coffee, Moss?
You've been at it since dawn.

16:04.440 --> 16:08.440
OK, so, primary larvae in the neck
wound tell us that Abel Lander died

16:09.320 --> 16:12.720
between seven and 10pm last night,
corroborating witness accounts.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.360
Enzymes at the wound tell us
a fox got to him

16:15.360 --> 16:17.280
a couple of hours postmortem.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.680
Although, evidence of a nose bleed
could have been a credible incentive

16:20.680 --> 16:22.680
to a half-starved winter fox.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.200
However that is not what killed
an old Survivor, no.

16:25.200 --> 16:29.200
Abel Lander died of a heart attack
induced by a substantial overdose

16:29.840 --> 16:32.720
of anti-psychotics
not prescribed for him.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.160
And we all pray for his sake

16:34.160 --> 16:36.640
that the latter kicked in
before the former.

16:36.640 --> 16:40.320
Now for my money, this is way too
piss-stained to be a Beckett.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.440
Moss.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.840
Abel was being stalked by
Diana Bagel.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.120
Nicknames are no good to us here,
pal. Fucking bagel...

16:47.120 --> 16:48.960
That's her name. Diana Bagel.

16:48.960 --> 16:52.280
Look, I'm not a qualified
practitioner, I know,

16:52.280 --> 16:55.960
but this woman is categorically
off her effing head!

16:55.960 --> 16:58.760
- And she's on anti-psychotics.
- Yeah, correct.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.440
You're not a qualified practitioner.

17:00.440 --> 17:04.359
But the doctors who sectioned her
at least three times to my knowledge

17:04.359 --> 17:05.680
presumably were.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.980
I can get you their names
if your system's too slow.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.680
We've offered, but she's refusing...

17:28.680 --> 17:30.960
I don't want any firearms
anywhere near me.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.360
You won't have a choice tonight.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.080
No visible weapons!

17:34.080 --> 17:35.920
That is the whole point, Caroline.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.800
You said you'd heard nothing
from Beckett.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.480
And that's the whole point.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.160
I don't like what you're
asking me to do.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.040
Bulletproof kit
for your own protection?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.720
Looking anything other than me!

17:44.720 --> 17:48.720
Viv! I've got this far
using nothing but my own voice.

17:48.720 --> 17:52.240
If I have to sit through my own
election count dressed like R2D2,

17:52.240 --> 17:55.000
how is that expressing defiance?
Or even confidence?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.800
With respect, Miss McCoy, you're not
the only one with a family.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.760
- We all deserve protecting.
- Yeah, I know.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.840
I know!
And I'm standing for election.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.000
Standing!

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
If all I'm doing is showing fear,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.240
then I might as well just spend
the rest of the day in bed!

18:08.800 --> 18:10.360
For fuck's sake!

18:10.360 --> 18:14.240
Stuart,
just tell them we need five minutes.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.040
Fucking hell. My make-up...

18:18.520 --> 18:21.000
You are just the spit of your mum
at school.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.480
I know you're doing this for her.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.800
I am, Viv, I'm trying to.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.720
And I understand what you're saying.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.160
Your whole campaign's been based on
"I will not back down."

18:32.160 --> 18:34.860
But we need you alive
to keep saying it.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.000
Ma'am, Lionel Dirkin's
in the building.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.480
- Why?!
- That is the last thing we need.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.960
He knew there'd be cameras.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.460
Hang on. He'll be teeming with
security, he always is.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.440
Let's start milking it.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.600
Let's get you out of here
and home safely

18:51.600 --> 18:53.900
for a lot less than I can afford.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.800
It's Stuart, isn't it?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.760
Can I just say,
I really value what you do.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.040
- All of you.
- You'll walk it, Caroline.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.640
Can I keep this one?

19:24.360 --> 19:25.600
Miss McCoy.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.320
I'm making no secret of
who I'm voting for.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.160
It'll pointedly be anybody but her.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.560
There he goes again, you see.

19:33.560 --> 19:36.280
For all of your allergies
to minorities, mate,

19:36.280 --> 19:37.980
you just voted for one.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.480
Yeah, but if you are worried,
and you're not telling me,

19:56.480 --> 19:58.800
you know I'll do my nut, don't you?

19:58.800 --> 20:00.880
I do, but what's doing my nut is,

20:00.880 --> 20:03.160
we're going away
and I don't know how long for.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.720
So I want checking by somebody
I know,

20:05.720 --> 20:07.760
not somebody from
wherever it is we're off.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.400
But if you are
and I'm not hearing it,

20:09.400 --> 20:11.600
I'd be fucking furious, Bonnie.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.640
We need to speak to a Diana Bagel.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.000
Is that your mum?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.840
Can I ask what this is about?

20:54.840 --> 20:56.560
You can't, I'm afraid.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.120
Aren't betting adverts depressing

20:58.120 --> 20:59.920
when you're not very good
with numbers?

20:59.920 --> 21:03.320
Can we get them taken down?

21:03.320 --> 21:04.840
Come in.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.160
Diana Bagel?

21:06.160 --> 21:08.800
I'm PC Tegan Thompson
and this is Jonah Mitchell.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.320
Poundshop batteries.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.160
They just make them
look like batteries.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.800
Mrs Bagel, we need to talk to you
about Abel Lander.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.640
You've had that.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.800
You're too late.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.960
Can you tell me exactly
what you mean by that?

21:27.960 --> 21:31.160
I've referred that tricky old nonce
to the Home Office.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.080
I had to.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.520
You're welcome to tea,
but the conversation's pointless.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.520
They'll be putting a top team
to take this way over your heads.

21:39.760 --> 21:40.840
Sit down.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.200
Abel Lander was found dead this
morning, Mrs Bagel.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.520
Next to his wife's grave.

21:48.520 --> 21:52.080
Oh, my good Lord, the poor man!

21:52.080 --> 21:54.800
You tried having him convicted
five times.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.960
So?! I only wanted him to rot!

21:57.960 --> 22:00.240
I'm sorry to ask you this,
but can I use your bathroom?

22:00.240 --> 22:01.760
Again?

22:01.760 --> 22:03.520
I can't help it!

22:03.520 --> 22:04.720
Leave her alone!

22:09.400 --> 22:11.760
Right, Ma'am,
let's have a look at this.

22:11.760 --> 22:15.760
CCTV from Abel Lander's
sheltered housing.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.080
Arrivals, departures,
going back weeks.

22:18.080 --> 22:22.080
Watch this pattern.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.920
No, these are music students.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.560
They're every Friday without fail.
Same today, except...

22:29.560 --> 22:32.080
He never showed.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.560
He can't have known he was dead. We
only released the name an hour ago.

22:35.560 --> 22:38.720
- We'll need to talk to him.
- Yep.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.240
Bang-on samples for
intimidation of an officer.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.800
Faye Caddy and a bloke with ovaries
called Rosemary Beckwith,

22:45.800 --> 22:47.600
hands like shovels.
They need bringing in.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.040
Hold your horses, Miller.
Your family's safe.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.920
Now, with your respect and patience,

22:51.920 --> 22:53.680
I'm... Gonna do fuck all!

22:53.680 --> 22:56.440
Seriously?! My family's had to be
shipped over t'moors!

22:56.440 --> 22:58.960
You weren't rushing to show
your face when they were nearby.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.440
How's that my fault? I was barred!

23:00.440 --> 23:02.840
How's it not your fault,
you twisted gusset!?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.720
Now, Faye Caddy is ours.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.520
Please just cut me some slack
until this election is over.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.560
If we want to catch these people
properly,

23:09.560 --> 23:11.640
we need to see
how they're thinking first.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.840
Ma'am, we just met Diana Bagel.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.160
What do we reckon?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.760
I was having flashbacks to Misery.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.760
Asked if I could use the bathroom.

23:18.760 --> 23:22.360
I shot all the meds I could find
in a two-minute sweep.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.160
Ablimol's Quetiepine.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.920
Quetiepine killed Lander.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.880
I need a warrant for the arrest
of Diana Bagel.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.280
Ma'am, we've just seen him.
Is he...?

23:34.880 --> 23:36.960
Yeah, that's Diana Bagel's son.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.500
Keeping it in the family.
Fetch them both in.

23:51.360 --> 23:54.200
Sam, can you tell us why you never
turned up to...?

23:55.440 --> 23:56.760
Ma'am, this is hopeless.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.840
- Can I have a word outside?
- What's he doing here?!

23:58.840 --> 24:01.280
- You can't be in here.
- I can if he is - that's my son.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.880
Mr Finestein is Sam's
nominated responsible adult.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.360
Well, we know him.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.600
We only know him for doing
fuck all to help us.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.880
Inappropriate language!

24:08.880 --> 24:11.240
- Beg your pardon. Less than fuck all!
- Right, you, out.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.400
- Why would you pick him, Sam?
- Come on, Mrs Bagel.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.500
Get your fucking hands off me!

24:17.680 --> 24:19.780
Actually, we will step outside.

24:24.360 --> 24:28.260
If either of them so much as speaks,
you bring one of...

24:28.920 --> 24:30.920
No, you hoof HIM out, right?

24:32.920 --> 24:34.320
You all right?

24:34.320 --> 24:37.160
- She said no talking.
- I'm asking if he's all right.

24:37.160 --> 24:38.800
Ma'am, she's not fit to interview.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.440
We should get Dr Peep
in to do a psych assessment.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.960
That's three hours I haven't got.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.600
I need to know this isn't Beckett.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.280
Fuck it.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.880
Drop the charges on her and
reinstate her as his guardian.

24:53.120 --> 24:56.040
Can you tell us about your
relationship with Abel Lander, Sam?

24:56.040 --> 24:57.320
No.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.960
No, and who'd want to put
that into words?

24:59.960 --> 25:01.680
Five reports, I filed.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.280
What did I hear back from you lot?

25:03.280 --> 25:06.640
- He's fingering kids willy-nilly and...
- He's a music teacher.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.680
He taught me music.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.240
He's bluffing it because he got
tampered with.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.000
He's been trained through fear to
keep it zipped, where you been?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.400
You're going to have to trick him
into saying stuff.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.520
- Absolutely not. Never.
- Lie!

25:17.520 --> 25:19.880
Were you ever assaulted by
Abel Lander?

25:19.880 --> 25:21.640
- Never.
- Lie!

25:21.640 --> 25:24.040
Mrs Bagel, this isn't working for
us.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.960
No, it won't.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.080
Cos you're asking all the
wrong questions.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.800
It's like, I've heard nothing about
lubricants

25:30.800 --> 25:33.400
and that's like
step one for detectives. I know.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.480
Hm? Which force?

25:34.480 --> 25:36.280
Netflix.

25:36.280 --> 25:39.240
I once made the mistake of telling
her that Mr Lander opened the

25:39.240 --> 25:40.720
door with no kecks on.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.480
She went ape. Got fixated on...

25:42.480 --> 25:45.400
I did not get fixated -
I reacted like a mother should.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.040
She got fixated enough to stop me
from going and hounded Abel.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.640
Both of us.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.960
She kept ringing the cops,
over and over and over again,

25:51.960 --> 25:53.280
repeating the first offence.

25:53.280 --> 25:56.120
Repeating the first offence, yes,
because I'd heard fuck all back!

25:56.120 --> 25:57.480
- Language!
- Well, I hadn't!

25:57.480 --> 26:00.760
Did you ever transport medication
that was prescribed to your

26:00.760 --> 26:02.320
mother to Abel Landers' house?

26:02.320 --> 26:03.840
Never.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.480
Did Abel Lander ever have
access to YOUR house?

26:06.480 --> 26:07.760
THAT'S A LIE!

26:07.760 --> 26:09.240
Mrs Bagel.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.680
Either shut up or leave.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.120
Well, I'm not shutting up.

26:12.120 --> 26:16.120
- He came round when Mum went to Brittany.
- See? Huh!

26:17.640 --> 26:19.600
And what happened at your house, Sam?

26:19.600 --> 26:21.520
If you don't want to use
the filthy words, Sam,

26:21.520 --> 26:23.280
you save them for a judge, yeah?

26:23.280 --> 26:26.160
We were trashing a keyboard I'd
bought on eBay to make it

26:26.160 --> 26:28.760
look like it cost less than 90.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.360
So she wouldn't find out I'd
spent 220 - that was it.

26:36.080 --> 26:37.180
He looked...

26:43.400 --> 26:45.400
We had one of our best days.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.720
He crapped on the sofa and I blamed
the cat.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.880
My cat?

26:56.880 --> 26:59.120
Interview terminated at 15:50.

26:59.120 --> 27:03.120
You'll be released without charge,
pending further investigation.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.680
Fella.
You can't be in here unsupervised.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.280
I was asked to leave the interview.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.960
Yeah, back to the main building.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.880
You're not allowed to loll here
gathering selective intelligence.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.280
I beg your pardon?

27:14.280 --> 27:17.400
Are you changing your mind about
protecting one of your own?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.840
Well, don't.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.000
You'd go down with her.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.200
I think the kid did it.

27:27.640 --> 27:28.660
Him?

27:30.360 --> 27:33.160
If Lander committed suicide, he
couldn't be buried with his wife.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.182
But how does that work?
Who's kidding who,

27:35.207 --> 27:37.184
if Lander's complicit,
if he knows it's coming?

27:37.240 --> 27:41.240
He'd have to specifically not know.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.920
And we reckon he'd have it in him?

27:44.920 --> 27:48.020
He's the only person I know
decent enough.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.480
Ma'am.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.160
If they're leaving, we need to get
Sam's clothes off him.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.920
Why not? Everybody else has.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.420
With your permission?

28:24.720 --> 28:28.520
This is your handwriting?

28:28.520 --> 28:29.520
Yes.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.960
So you spent a lot more time round
there than just the lessons?

28:53.360 --> 28:56.080
Tonnes more.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.680
You took care of him?

28:59.680 --> 29:01.360
Hey, no, no, no, mate. Not cool.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.000
We don't want anyone else in here.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Eh, look at me.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.200
And you say nothing.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.300
In fact...

29:15.440 --> 29:17.960
..how's your memory?

29:17.960 --> 29:21.840
Right, well, you remember every
single word that got said in there,

29:21.840 --> 29:23.720
and you say nothing else.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.220
Repeat only that, not one word more.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.480
My dad fucked off an all.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.980
Just bringing out the father in me.

29:37.920 --> 29:41.920
Right, you can stick that lot back
on. I'm not interested.

29:43.360 --> 29:47.360
Give him time to get dressed and
take him back upstairs, please.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.720
Can you spell that for me, please?

30:07.520 --> 30:10.120
Well, I've said I'll talk to him,
so...

30:10.120 --> 30:11.620
Yeah, put him through.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.000
So sorry.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.880
- Spike, now!
- Sarge.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.480
Interview terminated 16:06.
Excuse me.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.400
Miller.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.120
Yeah, listen, I'm hearing there was
a power-outage at the labs

30:53.120 --> 30:56.200
this morning? I just paid ?8.50
for a pair of tights.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.040
No, I mean...any of that stuff that
needed spectrometry

31:01.040 --> 31:03.480
- you might want putting through again.
- Because?

31:03.480 --> 31:05.160
Oh, admissible evidence.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.960
Or inadmissible - it's your shout.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.560
Send everything back. And tell them
I'm not paying for it.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.760
Too right, Ma'am.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.160
Not only is it not beneath him to
take the rubbish out,

31:47.160 --> 31:49.440
but he's found it in his
heart to do it again.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.440
Oh, Natalie, those are returned
samples on stuff that went

31:52.440 --> 31:53.520
through earlier.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.840
One of the inspectors is
requesting re-runs.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.320
Inspector Deering?

31:57.320 --> 32:00.040
Yeah, Deering.
And she's on the warpath, so...

32:08.440 --> 32:11.040
Were you about to stick me back
in your pocket?

32:11.040 --> 32:15.040
- Only because I have all this to...
- There's no-one else in here.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.480
I've just heard Dinah and Spike
are on the move.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.800
Not on their own, they're not.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.200
I've sent a bunch of brick
shithouses, armed to the teeth.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.280
I've put in a request for
aerial surveillance,

32:27.280 --> 32:29.240
but it's not looking good
at short notice.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.040
We've got a tracker on the vehicle.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.160
- Without a warrant? - What?
Without a warrant.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.560
What have we said?

32:44.760 --> 32:45.920
For your information,

32:45.920 --> 32:48.240
the tracker was fitted at the
request of the owner.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.560
Or one of the owners.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.280
- But that's only just occurred to you now!
- Big deal!

32:52.280 --> 32:54.920
We can't yet prove where
the money's headed,

32:54.920 --> 32:58.480
but we're pretty certain it's going
to end up with Beckett.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.960
It was an act of expediency.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.960
- But we file for the warrant?
- Fine.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.400
I didn't even want to go...
but I'm going to have to now.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.000
Right, they've done a left.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.960
No, wait.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.760
He's pulled into the
Rosehill Garden Centre.

33:28.760 --> 33:31.840
How rock'n'roll's a
garden centre for a drop off?

33:31.840 --> 33:34.520
This is Dennis. He's making sure
he's not being followed.

33:34.520 --> 33:37.320
Pull over where you can.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.800
ARU, turn off and sit back a few
streets and await a go.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.760
We're convinced it's not suspicious,

33:50.760 --> 33:52.440
just a cautionary stunt.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.640
Copy that.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.640
I'm not liking this.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.440
We need eyes on it.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.400
Listen, I'm sorry for flaring.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.840
Do your family know that you
care this much?

34:28.840 --> 34:31.440
No, they won't fucking listen,
Ma'am.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.800
Come in!

34:32.800 --> 34:34.360
I'm so sorry, Ma'am,

34:34.360 --> 34:37.360
but we've had three strikes on the
evidence from Abel Lander's flat.

34:37.360 --> 34:41.360
No, I bow to rank when it's not
just us, Natalie.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.280
Oh, sweet Jesus!

34:50.280 --> 34:53.840
No disrespect to Abel Lander,
but this is like a fucking birthday!

34:53.840 --> 34:57.120
There's a partial print that
couldn't fully put Faye Caddy

34:57.120 --> 35:00.840
at the scene...except her DNA's
under one of Lander's fingernails.

35:00.840 --> 35:04.360
It's only a micro sample, but it's
a 98% match from a 2015 arrest.

35:04.360 --> 35:07.920
Gavin,
who is the duty magistrate on?

35:07.920 --> 35:10.720
Well, if he knows it's me, he'll
take it in the bath.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.840
We need a warrant drafting for
Faye Caddy, now.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.960
I can save you a lot of trouble
finding her,

35:15.960 --> 35:19.160
cos I know exactly where
she'll be by, say...teatime.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.440
Take a team.

35:20.440 --> 35:23.840
But make sure we're watching the
watchers, yeah?

35:46.600 --> 35:48.500
Have you got me a name?

35:53.960 --> 35:56.600
It's my career, if anyone finds out.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.600
It's your family, if you don't.

35:58.600 --> 36:02.520
By the way, you can move them as
much as you want but it's never

36:02.520 --> 36:05.620
taken us more than ten days
to find anybody.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.360
If only you had that many days left,
Faye.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.880
What?

36:10.880 --> 36:13.320
What you...? Fuck off!
What you doing?

36:13.320 --> 36:15.640
I don't even know you!

36:15.640 --> 36:17.840
I don't even know him.
Look, I'm on me own, here.

36:17.840 --> 36:21.840
I didn't believe it either,
but he is - he's with the police.

36:25.680 --> 36:29.040
First time your name cropped up,
threatening behaviour.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.240
Shouted "parasite" at a
three-year-old blind girl in public.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.920
She wasn't blind.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.000
That was the point - her parents
were milking it!

36:36.000 --> 36:38.320
Parasite? From you?

36:38.320 --> 36:39.880
She could see better than me.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.880
And the definition of that word is
what got me acquitted -

36:42.880 --> 36:45.840
she was a three-year-old girl,
of course she's a parasite.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.160
Look, I'm going to start screaming
in a minute.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.080
I think you need to calm
down and listen.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.720
cos this is the only chance you're
going to get to find out

36:52.720 --> 36:55.040
- what Dennis is going to make of all this.
- All what?

36:55.040 --> 36:58.760
You're about to be charged with the
hate crime murder of Abel Lander.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.000
Who?!

37:00.000 --> 37:02.960
I'll leave it to a jury to work out
how you tried framing Diana Bagel

37:02.960 --> 37:05.840
using medication specific to
someone with an enduring grudge.

37:05.840 --> 37:09.640
I categorically don't know anyone
called fucking Bagel.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.400
You won't get this to stick
past the first lawyer.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.320
It's actually going to stick
like shit to a blanket, Faye,

37:15.320 --> 37:17.680
because you left DNA traces at both
addresses - the one you

37:17.680 --> 37:20.640
burgled to nick the meds and blame a
schizophrenic with a vendetta...

37:20.640 --> 37:23.520
Oh, fuck off! I wouldn't touch a
schizophrenic with a barge pole.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.200
..and Lander's flat,
where you spiked his drink.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.200
Oh, right.

37:28.200 --> 37:31.000
Is this what your
"science department" does?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.560
It plants evidence?

37:32.560 --> 37:36.000
No, Faye.
We tell stories with solid objects.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
No-one's going to swallow that
shit. And I'll have alibis.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.280
Dennis isn't going to vouch for
you!

37:41.280 --> 37:44.800
This is a receipt you signed
for police money.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.280
That's your signature.

37:46.280 --> 37:49.120
That signature was for
50 quid off the BBC,

37:49.120 --> 37:51.520
which you've got by deception.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.080
And, point of law,
I never got that money.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.880
Well, the tough shit for you, Faye,

37:55.880 --> 37:58.720
is that you were the only one who
actually signed their own name.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.720
And when Dennis sees six backdated
payments for non-specific services,

38:03.440 --> 38:06.160
same dabs on each one,
well, face it,

38:06.160 --> 38:07.680
you couldn't look more like a mole.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.280
And also face it - this is you,

38:10.280 --> 38:14.280
talking to the most dead cop in our
world on the day she died.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.320
Now, it'll be suggested that she
was handling you.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.760
Of course, there's stuff we'll
never know, what with Joy...

38:19.760 --> 38:23.000
..taking secrets to her grave.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.680
Now, I think you're safer copping
for Lander than Dennis waiting

38:25.680 --> 38:29.680
for you to get out and pay his
dues for loyalty.

38:30.280 --> 38:34.040
Now, I never got the chance to say
Don't fuck with me, Faye,

38:34.040 --> 38:37.520
so this is sort of me
saying it twice.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.040
I don't know why you're
threatening me with that.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.240
You're the only one that sounds
remandable on there.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.880
No, I'm going to store it for my
daughter so she can hear it after

38:45.880 --> 38:49.800
I'm dead. Inspire her to make sure
that you're kept where you're put.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.700
See, if nothing else,
she's got my gob.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.560
They picked here because he knew

39:19.560 --> 39:22.280
the camera system only
covered staff vehicles.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.800
Wasn't an accident

39:34.840 --> 39:36.400
Bonnie, that wasn't quick.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.960
- You all right?
- No!

39:38.960 --> 39:42.720
What?

39:42.720 --> 39:44.600
There's a proper Shell stop
in two minutes.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.840
But no, I go to Little Geoff and
spent ten minutes

39:46.840 --> 39:48.200
wiping piss off the seat and...

39:48.200 --> 39:51.800
Gavin, we need some navigational
help, get the big map out.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.960
We've picked up some
location markers.

39:53.960 --> 39:57.920
We're looking for a Little Geoff
shack, near-ish to a Shell stop.

39:57.920 --> 40:01.920
Within a couple of miles
of a Shell stop.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.640
What're we looking for?

40:06.640 --> 40:08.720
You're on speaker.
Miller's here, Is that OK?

40:08.720 --> 40:10.640
Yeah, or I'll fuck off if you want.

40:10.640 --> 40:14.480
Actually, Gavin, put Miller on the
map and you trace a number for me.

40:14.480 --> 40:18.480
07700 900 463.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.640
We need to know where it's heading.

40:20.640 --> 40:24.640
We're assuming westbound.

40:32.440 --> 40:36.240
He certainly looks like it's
going to swing your way.

40:36.240 --> 40:39.200
- He looks haunted.
- And he made a shit decision.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.920
He kept his kids off school when
no-one else was allowed to.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.720
It's a hard judge who'd twat a fella
for sheltering his family.

40:44.720 --> 40:45.920
I don't care, he knows it.

40:45.920 --> 40:49.360
Even if he wins, he's fucked.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.880
Whoa, you mad bitch!

40:51.880 --> 40:52.960
Sorry, Ma'am.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.520
What were you told?
Stuart escorts you from the vehicle,

40:55.520 --> 40:58.820
 ONLY when the other team
arrive for shelter.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.520
Sorry.

41:01.520 --> 41:02.620
It's nerves.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.840
OK, yeah, so the only Little Geoff
they could have hit

41:09.840 --> 41:11.960
that's near a Shell stop is
Springhill Cross.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.960
Yeah, that's not too far from here.
Let's go.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.960
We've got them located, currently
in a village called Brompton Mead.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.160
- ARU, are you getting this?
- Yes, we are.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.680
Don't stay too far back.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.720
Actually, the opposite.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.960
Since we've got a good idea of
where we're heading,

41:27.960 --> 41:31.640
- I want you to split up. Dinah,
- I want you to stay on the A537.

41:31.640 --> 41:35.040
- Will do.
- ARU units, approach from the eastbound

41:35.040 --> 41:39.040
- to avoid exposure.
- Understood, Ma'am.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.560
Can you just
explain something?

41:46.560 --> 41:49.560
If I could, I would, but I can't,
babe, no.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.360
I meant, why we have to lose a Jag

41:51.360 --> 41:54.040
and end up in an old Corolla
with duff heating?

41:54.040 --> 41:57.120
Right, we're looking for a Corolla!

41:57.120 --> 41:59.280
Well done, missus.
Fuck, she knows her stuff.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.320
I repeat, a Corolla,
heading westbound towards Liverpool.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.680
That really narrows it down, Spike.

42:04.680 --> 42:06.960
She's not as scared as I am,
is she, Ma'am?

42:06.960 --> 42:09.520
She's not, Stuart.

42:09.520 --> 42:11.720
Can I have all metal objects in
the trays please,

42:11.720 --> 42:14.720
then step forward for scanning,
folks.

42:19.480 --> 42:21.440
Madam Mayor.

42:24.160 --> 42:27.200
If you'd lost tonight,
were you going to break in with these?

42:27.200 --> 42:31.200
That is just running one home
and one business.

42:36.320 --> 42:39.760
On the night of the hustings, were
the candidates searched? Was Caroline?

42:39.760 --> 42:42.460
No, they were all fast-tracked. Why?

42:44.360 --> 42:45.720
Ma'am, I'm not getting this.

42:45.720 --> 42:49.720
This is too much meandering for just
heading for Holyhead on an A-road.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.680
- Ma'am?
- I'm agreeing with you, Spike.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.120
Springhill Cross...

42:56.120 --> 42:58.640
I've seen Springhill Cross on
paperwork recently.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.640
Ma'am, it's Dirkin's house.

43:03.360 --> 43:06.000
Seriously?
They're going to Dirkin with the money?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.900
We thought he funded them.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.560
Jesus, what's the gun for?

43:30.560 --> 43:33.120
Gun? Dennis, where are we going?

43:33.120 --> 43:35.520
They've asked me to kill Beckett.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.920
But I've decided not to.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.220
What the fuck does that mean?

43:51.960 --> 43:55.560
We haven't led Bonnie down the
garden path here, have we?

43:55.560 --> 43:58.040
I mean like...literally?

43:58.040 --> 43:59.480
No, scratch that, no, no.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.920
He's not going to pop a woman who's
carrying his kid, is he?

44:01.920 --> 44:03.920
He would if he thinks it's not his.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.840
- Well, is it?
- No.

44:06.840 --> 44:09.600
Apparently not.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.360
Dinah, you're going to have to
drop your speed for me, darling.

44:12.360 --> 44:16.360
They've just turned into
Dirkin's house.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.440
Get out the car! Put your hands up!

44:41.440 --> 44:42.740
Out the car, now!

44:56.400 --> 44:58.900
Armed police, armed police! Move!

45:08.240 --> 45:09.920
Dirkin's been hit.

45:09.920 --> 45:12.040
One in the chest, one in the balls.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.800
His boyfriend identified Beckett.

45:14.800 --> 45:16.760
He got off before we arrived.

45:16.760 --> 45:18.460
Beckett is still alive.

45:21.800 --> 45:25.800
And the incumbent mayor,
Kashif Hassan, 13,246 votes.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.760
Leaving Miss Caroline McCoy with an
overall majority of 24,321 votes.

45:35.680 --> 45:39.680
I hereby announce that Caroline
McCoy, Independent, is duly elected

45:40.360 --> 45:42.760
Mayor of the City of Manchester.

45:42.760 --> 45:46.680
People of Manchester,
we salute you!!

45:50.720 --> 45:53.320
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

45:53.320 --> 45:56.720
He meant to miss.

45:56.720 --> 46:00.720
He meant to miss.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.400
Madam Mayor.

46:06.400 --> 46:09.560
So our girl is dead so that bint
could become a politician?

46:09.560 --> 46:11.600
Things are going to change
now that I'm Mayor.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.200
Dinah's going to go mental.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.160
I'll be seeing you both in
about a month.

46:15.160 --> 46:16.680
All we've got is Dennis Caddy.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.840
- Well, you can't just release him.
- No, I want him working for us.

46:19.840 --> 46:23.840
- Can I just have a word, Ma'am?
- What have you done?
