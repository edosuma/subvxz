...for saving the world
from the Martians...

I have to.

01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:46.484
I prepared a speech. Is that all right?

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.320
Sure, that's very appropriate.

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:56.077
Hi, everybody.

01:37:56.912 --> 01:37:58.288

Can you speak up? We can't hear you.

Well, I want to say that there's
a lot of people in the world...

01:38:04.795 --> 01:38:07.255
...that have, like,
done a lot more than I have...

01:38:07.423 --> 01:38:12.302
...and they're the ones
that should be here now getting a medal.

01:38:13.637 --> 01:38:18.224
And I want to thank my grandma
for always being so good to me...

...and for helping save the world
and everything.

...start over and start rebuilding everything,
like our houses.

But I was thinking, maybe instead
of houses, we could live in tepees...

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:37.827
...because it's better in a lot of ways.

01:38:41.290 --> 01:38:44.292
Okay, that's all I have to say. Thanks.
