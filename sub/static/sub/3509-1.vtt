WEBVTT

00:01.373 --> 00:02.322
There are two kinds of folks

00:02.379 --> 00:03.979
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:04.313 --> 00:06.039
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:06.277 --> 00:07.299
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:07.700 --> 00:08.300
Who am I?

00:08.389 --> 00:09.528
I'm Rick Castle.

00:09.529 --> 00:09.929
Castle.

00:09.963 --> 00:10.623
Castle.

00:10.624 --> 00:12.324
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:12.378 --> 00:14.568
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.778 --> 00:15.597
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.844 --> 00:17.111
Beckett.
Aah!

00:17.384 --> 00:19.469
Beckett?
Could you get some backup, please?

00:19.820 --> 00:21.704
<i>And thanks to my friendship</i>
<i>with the Mayor,</i>

00:21.755 --> 00:23.389
<i>I get to be on her case.</i>
Oh!

00:23.423 --> 00:25.992
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.660
<i>And together,</i>
<i>we catch killers.</i>

00:28.208 --> 00:31.410
I hate this case.
I know. Isn't it great?

00:38.383 --> 00:39.084
Where'd he go?!

00:39.183 --> 00:41.918
I lost him.

00:41.952 --> 00:44.137
I think he went through here!

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:01.338 --> 01:03.640
Castle, down on the ground, now!

01:21.503 --> 01:23.421
Come on.

01:35.611 --> 01:38.879
Are you guys re-enacting
the humpty dumpty crime scene?

01:38.914 --> 01:41.482
It's the autumnal equinox
today.

01:41.516 --> 01:43.517
Yeah, and according
to Mr. Wizard there,

01:43.585 --> 01:45.720
it's the only time of year you
can balance an egg on its tip.

01:45.754 --> 01:46.889
Don't you guys have work to do?
Nah.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.576
No, not really.
Hmm. Well, now you do.

01:53.401 --> 01:55.403
By the way, that whole thing
with the egg

01:55.457 --> 01:57.258
is just urban legend.
Not true.

01:57.292 --> 01:59.927
I saw Castle do it
last year.

02:04.053 --> 02:06.604
What's wrong with you?

02:06.639 --> 02:08.639
Still no word from him?

02:08.674 --> 02:10.608
No.

02:12.178 --> 02:14.529
Maybe you should call him.

02:14.563 --> 02:16.381
He said that he would
be back the fall,

02:16.403 --> 02:19.538
and it's fall, so clearly,
he has better things to do.

02:20.190 --> 02:22.090
Maybe he's not back
from the Hamptons yet.

02:22.125 --> 02:23.026
Maybe he's still working
on his book.

02:28.895 --> 02:32.297
Beckett.

02:32.332 --> 02:33.932
Yeah.

02:36.035 --> 02:37.953
I need you people
to move back, please.

02:37.987 --> 02:39.421
Ma'am, please get back.

02:42.392 --> 02:44.910
Ooh.
Speaking of humpty dumpty.

02:44.944 --> 02:48.030
Maybe somebody tried
to stand her up on her head.

02:48.064 --> 02:50.582
After all, it is
the autumnal equinox.

02:50.616 --> 02:53.101
It wasn't the fall
that killed her.

02:53.136 --> 02:55.053
More like multiple
gunshot wounds to the torso

02:55.087 --> 02:58.056
before doing a Greg Louganis
out that window up there.

02:58.396 --> 03:00.497
Victim's name is Chloe Whitman.
Couple of pedestrians

03:00.531 --> 03:02.866
heard shots and saw the body
fall out the window,

03:02.915 --> 03:04.816
but when uniforms got here,
the apartment was empty.

03:04.834 --> 03:07.235
There's no doorman on duty,
so, so far, no one recalls

03:07.270 --> 03:08.754
seeing anyone flee the scene.

03:09.587 --> 03:11.471
All right, have uniforms
start knocking on doors.

03:11.522 --> 03:14.257
Find out what else
our neighbors didn't see.

03:14.292 --> 03:17.260
Hey, it's Castle.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.642
Guess he did
finish that book.

03:33.112 --> 03:36.481
Nice of him
to send us a copy.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.301
It looks like
he's back in town.

03:40.336 --> 03:41.853
Nice of him to call.

03:41.887 --> 03:43.906
All right, guys. You can stop
pining for your girlfriend.

03:43.911 --> 03:46.012
After all, we got a body
full of holes.

03:46.046 --> 03:47.248
So what else do we know
about our victim?

03:47.558 --> 03:49.258
She's got a boyfriend.
Evan Murphy. He's on his way.

03:50.628 --> 03:55.064
Okay, let's go upstairs
and see what else we can find.

04:08.112 --> 04:10.046
He really is ruggedly handsome.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.331
Mm.

04:13.604 --> 04:16.140
From the spatter pattern, she
was backing away from the door.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.450
After the first bullet hits her,
she tries to get away.

04:18.483 --> 04:20.752
Got nowhere to go
but out the window.

04:20.786 --> 04:22.287
So large caliber gun.

04:22.321 --> 04:24.890
Round goes through her
and breaks the glass.

04:24.924 --> 04:26.341
She goes diving out.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.096
Looks like
she was leaving town.

04:37.020 --> 04:38.788
Well, it wasn't a robbery.

04:38.808 --> 04:40.709
Would you check these items
for fibers and prints?

04:40.743 --> 04:41.978
If we're lucky,
there was a struggle.

04:41.988 --> 04:43.188
Sure. We'll take care of it.

04:43.215 --> 04:46.550
Beckett,
Chloe's boyfriend Evan is here.

04:48.003 --> 04:51.655
So someone just came here
and shot her for no reason?

04:51.690 --> 04:54.558
Well, usually, in cases
like these, there is a reason.

04:54.593 --> 04:57.561
How long had you
and Ms. Whitman been dating?

04:59.151 --> 05:00.885
About six months.

05:00.919 --> 05:03.221
And was there anyone in her life
with violent tendencies,

05:03.247 --> 05:05.515
maybe anyone that
she had disputes with?

05:05.550 --> 05:07.117
No. No, she...

05:07.151 --> 05:10.921
The worst thing I ever
saw her do was jaywalk.

05:10.955 --> 05:13.640
What did she do for a living?
She's a teacher.

05:13.691 --> 05:16.059
She was a teacher.

05:16.906 --> 05:18.339
They all loved her.

05:18.374 --> 05:20.375
Were you
expecting her over tonight?

05:20.409 --> 05:23.611
No. Why?
Well, she packed an overnight bag.

05:23.646 --> 05:26.347
That--
that doesn't make sense.

05:26.382 --> 05:27.799
She--she has class tomorrow.

05:27.850 --> 05:31.069
She wouldn't just leave
without saying anything.

05:32.371 --> 05:33.955
Excuse me.

05:36.892 --> 05:40.127
Victim had it in her hand.
It was in her fingers so tight,

05:40.240 --> 05:41.774
I almost didn't see it.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.785
This is an address in Tribeca.
Could be where she was going.

05:44.819 --> 05:46.719
Only one way to find out.

05:47.971 --> 05:50.223
The address is registered
to a Maya Santori.

05:50.261 --> 05:51.878
32. She's clean.
No priors.

05:51.912 --> 05:53.480
417?
Yeah.

05:53.514 --> 05:55.151
Yeah, right there.

05:56.584 --> 05:58.268
It's open.

06:30.053 --> 06:32.287
NYPD!
NYPD! Let me see your hands.

06:32.322 --> 06:33.889
Drop it, now!
Gun!

06:33.923 --> 06:35.890
No!

06:35.908 --> 06:37.576
Whoa!

06:37.610 --> 06:38.660
Castle?

06:38.695 --> 06:40.362
Beckett?

06:40.396 --> 06:42.397
What are you doing here?

06:42.432 --> 06:43.966
I... uh...

06:44.003 --> 06:45.837
Down! Down!
Put it down!

06:45.871 --> 06:48.256
Drop that gun now!
Drop the gun, stupid!
Drop the gun!

06:48.290 --> 06:50.375
Yeah, no, no, it's okay.
Drop it, slimebag!

06:50.426 --> 06:52.677
Whoa. Okay, guys, easy.
It's not what it looks like.

06:52.711 --> 06:55.830
It never is. Turn around.

06:55.864 --> 06:57.715
Castle, turn around.

06:57.766 --> 07:00.435
Richard Castle,
you're under arrest for murder.

07:15.909 --> 07:17.194
Something's different.

07:17.248 --> 07:19.383
Did you remodel?

07:24.656 --> 07:27.624
You've been informed
of your rights, Mr. Castle?

07:27.659 --> 07:29.226
Really?

07:29.260 --> 07:31.728
You're not even gonna ask me
how my summer was?

07:31.763 --> 07:34.297
You are aware that you're
under arrest for murder?

07:34.332 --> 07:37.868
I thought you were being rough
with the cuffs just for fun.

07:37.902 --> 07:39.469
You look good.

07:39.504 --> 07:41.571
You look good, too.

07:41.606 --> 07:42.639
Yeah?

07:42.674 --> 07:44.875
For murder.
Why are you so mad at me?

07:44.970 --> 07:46.921
Maybe because you were found
standing over a dead body

07:46.972 --> 07:48.706
with a gun in your hand.

07:48.774 --> 07:50.192
Yeah, but I told you,
she was dead when I got there.

07:50.392 --> 07:52.443
Why didn't you call?

07:55.247 --> 07:58.983
I was going to call you.

07:59.017 --> 08:01.552
But then you showed up
before I could.

08:02.748 --> 08:05.516
Really?

08:04.312 --> 08:07.614
Well, then why did we find you
in our victim's apartment?

08:07.649 --> 08:09.116
Well, because she called me.

08:09.150 --> 08:12.019
Oh, so you and Ms. Santori
were in a relationship.

08:12.253 --> 08:13.688
Well, I wouldn't say
it was a relationship.

08:13.746 --> 08:14.615
I bought a couple
of sculptures from her.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.825
Were you sleeping with her?

08:17.001 --> 08:18.752
How is that relevant?
Motive.

08:18.786 --> 08:20.236
Ah.

08:20.254 --> 08:23.073
No, I wasn't
sleeping with her.

08:23.107 --> 08:25.041
Are you sure?
Beautiful woman--

08:25.076 --> 08:27.110
I'm in a relationship.
With whom?

08:27.144 --> 08:28.946
Is that a new lipstick?
Castle.

08:28.993 --> 08:29.795
You know with whom.

08:29.805 --> 08:31.605
How should I know?
I haven't seen you in months.

08:31.729 --> 08:33.697
You could've been
in dozens of relationships

08:33.731 --> 08:35.832
with women since then.
You sound jealous.

08:35.866 --> 08:37.884
Jealous of you dating your
second ex-wife and publisher?

08:38.904 --> 08:41.873
Tell me, does she make you
do <i>everything</i> on a deadline?

08:41.907 --> 08:43.375
So how about you?

08:43.409 --> 08:45.577
You still with that,
uh, cop boyfriend of yours?

08:45.611 --> 08:47.612
What was his name again--
Demming?

08:50.149 --> 08:51.649
You broke up?

08:51.667 --> 08:54.786
This victim that called you,
what was it about?

08:54.820 --> 08:56.088
She said she was in trouble

08:56.149 --> 08:57.285
and she couldn't go
to the police.

08:57.295 --> 08:59.115
So why did she call you?

08:59.704 --> 09:04.007
Because Maya knew I had
a relationship with you--ooh.

09:04.042 --> 09:05.075
With the NYPD.

09:05.168 --> 09:07.236
She thought I could help.
Help how?

09:07.270 --> 09:09.738
Well, she didn't say.
She just told me to come over.

09:09.772 --> 09:12.241
When I got the, the door
was open. The place was trashed.

09:13.100 --> 09:13.934
She was dead on the bed,

09:13.939 --> 09:15.907
and there was a gun
on the floor.

09:15.941 --> 09:18.743
So you, being the expert veteran
of dozens of crime scenes,

09:18.778 --> 09:20.745
decided to pick up
the murder weapon to,

09:20.780 --> 09:22.781
what, ensure that
we had your prints?

09:22.815 --> 09:25.750
Maybe you missed the part
where I said she was shot dead.

09:25.785 --> 09:27.602
When I heard the noises
coming from the next room,

09:27.653 --> 09:29.454
I thought whoever killed her
was coming back.

09:29.488 --> 09:31.456
So I picked up the gun
to defend myself.

09:31.490 --> 09:34.392
It seemed like a very good idea
at the time. That's when you,

09:34.410 --> 09:36.928
<i>Esposito and Annie Oakley come</i>
<i>bursting through the door.</i>

09:36.962 --> 09:39.364
Annie Oakley?
<i>Detective Esposito was responding--</i>

09:39.398 --> 09:42.700
<i>I am not a threat...</i>
I kinda almost shot Castle.

09:43.995 --> 09:45.162
What? He had a gun.

09:45.217 --> 09:46.601
Shoulda let you shoot him.

09:46.675 --> 09:47.993
It would've served him right
for not calling.

09:48.003 --> 09:49.103
<i>We should be</i>

09:49.128 --> 09:51.629
<i>at the crime scene</i>
<i>looking for clues.</i>

09:51.664 --> 09:54.699
<i>So tell me,</i>
<i>why should I believe you,</i>

09:54.733 --> 09:57.302
considering that you pretty much
make up stories for a living?

09:57.336 --> 09:58.903
Because you know me.

10:01.357 --> 10:03.358
Do you know her?
Chloe Whitman.

10:03.409 --> 10:05.109
She was shot to death.

10:05.144 --> 10:08.046
Your friend's address
was found in her hands

10:08.080 --> 10:09.681
after she was killed.

10:09.715 --> 10:11.816
Another murder?
What's their connection?

10:11.884 --> 10:14.985
I don't know. You were the one
with the gun. You tell me.

10:16.722 --> 10:18.106
Beckett, a word.

10:18.157 --> 10:20.958
Hey, Captain.
How's it going?

10:20.993 --> 10:22.610
What? You, too?

10:22.645 --> 10:23.778
Real--

10:23.829 --> 10:25.996
come on, guys.

10:27.332 --> 10:28.966
C.S.U. recovered the slugs

10:29.001 --> 10:31.102
from Maya Santori
and Chloe Whitman's place.

10:31.933 --> 10:34.869
The gun was a .45.
Castle was holding a .38.

10:34.903 --> 10:38.022
So it must have belonged
to the victim for self-defense,

10:38.066 --> 10:40.050
which means that Castle
was telling the truth.

10:40.084 --> 10:42.903
But I'd be happy to hold him
if you like.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.084
You're free to go.

10:46.176 --> 10:47.176
Well, that's it?

10:47.250 --> 10:50.486
Bullets don't match your gun.
You're off the hook.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.855
I'm--ooh!

10:52.873 --> 10:54.356
So what's our next move?

10:54.374 --> 10:56.342
There isn't one,
at least not for you.

10:56.376 --> 10:58.344
You're going home.
Whoa, whoa, whoa

10:58.378 --> 11:00.030
two victims, one of 'em
an acquaintance of mine,

11:00.076 --> 11:00.845
and you're sending me home?

11:00.855 --> 11:03.355
You're a witness, Castle.
I can't have you involved.

11:03.376 --> 11:06.377
I'm already involved.
Castle, go home.

11:07.006 --> 11:10.141
Go back to your Hamptons,
your ex-wife,

11:10.176 --> 11:11.593
your book parties.

11:11.644 --> 11:15.513
Okay? I've got work to do.

11:15.548 --> 11:17.748
What did I do?

11:30.230 --> 11:32.064
Darling!

11:32.115 --> 11:34.984
Hello! Oh,
you must see this video.

11:35.018 --> 11:38.020
It's absolutely...
Charming.

11:38.055 --> 11:40.723
A penguin smacks another penguin
into an ice hole.

11:40.757 --> 11:42.224
I'll show you.

11:42.242 --> 11:43.726
Ah, maybe later.

11:43.760 --> 11:47.563
Oh, you look as if someone
smacked you into an ice hole.

11:49.124 --> 11:51.625
I stopped by the precinct.

11:51.653 --> 11:53.588
I thought you weren't going back
till after the book tour.

11:53.674 --> 11:55.275
Yeah, well, fate intervened.

11:55.309 --> 11:57.677
Someone I know was murdered today.
Oh, lord.

11:57.711 --> 11:59.345
Dad, that's awful. Who?

11:59.380 --> 12:01.781
Maya. The woman who made
that sculpture for me.

12:01.816 --> 12:05.351
Any leads?
No, not yet.

12:05.386 --> 12:07.487
So how is everyone?

12:07.521 --> 12:10.023
Beckett have
a nice summer?

12:10.057 --> 12:11.858
Yeah, everyone's fine.

12:13.381 --> 12:15.049
Now why don't I believe you?

12:15.066 --> 12:17.067
Aren't you with Chet
on Tuesdays?

12:17.101 --> 12:19.002
Oh! That was never
set in stone.

12:19.036 --> 12:20.970
Besides,
Alexis is in crisis.

12:21.005 --> 12:23.423
The young man
from the summer program

12:23.457 --> 12:25.925
still hasn't called her.
Despite the fact he said we'd talk

12:25.976 --> 12:27.978
when he got back from Europe,
which he already did.

12:28.022 --> 12:29.757
Well, if you knew he was back,
why don't you just call him?

12:29.767 --> 12:31.267
He's the one who went away.

12:31.346 --> 12:32.748
I mean, if he still cared,
he would've called.

12:32.758 --> 12:34.578
Maybe he was going to,
but he didn't know

12:34.283 --> 12:36.350
how you'd feel about it.
Maybe he was worried

12:36.385 --> 12:39.103
that something had changed
while he was away.

12:39.154 --> 12:40.921
Oh, Richard Castle,

12:40.956 --> 12:42.890
that is the stupidest thing
I ever heard.

12:42.924 --> 12:45.192
Have I taught you nothing
about relationships?

12:45.226 --> 12:48.696
You're a shining example. Just
how big a deal is this anyway?

12:51.394 --> 12:53.446
I don't know if I even
want to see him anymore.

12:53.454 --> 12:55.222
Oh, come on. You're not even
giving him a chance.

12:55.239 --> 12:56.590
Why are you siding with him?

12:56.660 --> 13:00.828
I'm not. I ju--
maybe he'll do something

13:00.979 --> 13:01.980
that will make it right.

13:01.992 --> 13:05.361
Maybe he'll just--
maybe he'll surprise you.

13:05.395 --> 13:07.930
Maybe he missed his chance.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.309
If you ask me, you shoulda
locked him up just outta spite.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.744
No, that'd be unethical...

13:32.779 --> 13:35.013
Making the people down
in holding deal with him.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.431
True.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.116
Hey. Whoa.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.868
So... ballistics ran
a comparison

13:39.919 --> 13:41.837
of the slugs
from the two murders.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.488
They're from the same gun.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.357
Anything on the canvass?

13:45.375 --> 13:47.392
Well, we showed Chloe's photos
to Maya's friends and neighbors.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.594
They don't recognize her.
And Chloe's boyfriend

13:49.629 --> 13:50.930
and her colleagues
from her prep school,

13:50.948 --> 13:53.499
they don't know Maya either.

14:04.059 --> 14:06.960
Okay, so we've got...

14:06.995 --> 14:08.929
A High School
chemistry teacher

14:08.947 --> 14:10.397
and a sculptor

14:10.431 --> 14:12.399
who live on
two different sides of town

14:12.434 --> 14:15.469
and by all accounts, run in
completely different circles.

14:15.503 --> 14:17.438
They're both killed
on the same day

14:17.472 --> 14:20.174
and by the same person.

14:20.208 --> 14:24.194
There lives
must intersect somehow.

14:24.229 --> 14:26.113
All right,
run phones and financials.

14:26.147 --> 14:28.082
Let's see if anything pops.

14:28.116 --> 14:30.417
On it.

14:37.811 --> 14:41.380
I'm gonna go and see Lanie
and see if she's found anything.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.184
Ryan!

14:48.805 --> 14:49.955
Hey, L.T.

14:49.993 --> 14:51.961
Hey, Castle.
Back on the beat.

14:51.979 --> 14:54.430
Yeah, looking that way.
Is, uh, Beckett here?

14:54.448 --> 14:56.399
Finished her sweep
about an hour ago.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.867
Did she find anything?

14:57.902 --> 14:59.986
Nothing useful.

15:00.020 --> 15:01.971
Mind if I take
a look around?

15:25.138 --> 15:26.272
Hey, brother.

15:26.329 --> 15:28.796
Yeah.
Looks like you missed one.

15:28.815 --> 15:30.932
Okay.

15:36.272 --> 15:38.273
Hey.

15:38.307 --> 15:40.475
Hey I hear you made
an interesting arrest today.

15:40.510 --> 15:42.377
You want to talk about it?

15:42.411 --> 15:44.646
No.
Okay.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.898
Keep holding that stuff in.
You gon' get an ulcer.

15:46.933 --> 15:48.583
Anything unusual?

15:48.618 --> 15:50.252
You mean besides the gunshots?

15:50.286 --> 15:51.686
Yeah,
I'm looking for anything

15:51.721 --> 15:53.672
that will connect
these two victims.

15:53.723 --> 15:55.891
They both had tattoos.
Everyone has tattoos.

15:55.925 --> 15:58.093
Chloe Whitman, our jumper,

15:58.127 --> 15:59.611
has a Rose.

15:59.645 --> 16:02.764
And Ms. Santori
has a mermaid...

16:02.782 --> 16:05.016
On her back.

16:05.051 --> 16:08.303
Looking at the work, it could
be the same tattoo artist.

16:08.321 --> 16:09.671
Anything else?

16:09.705 --> 16:11.272
It may be nothing,

16:11.290 --> 16:14.376
but I found this
on Ms. Whitman's hand.

16:18.629 --> 16:19.780
"2-2-7

16:19.946 --> 16:21.480
could be an apartment number,

16:21.514 --> 16:23.682
gym locker code,
and looking how faded it is,

16:23.716 --> 16:26.068
I'd say she wrote it
about a week ago.
Okay.

16:26.119 --> 16:29.955
Oh, and I found these
in Ms. Santori's pockets.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.157
Cab receipts?

16:32.191 --> 16:34.192
Dated today, just a few hours
before she was killed.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.128
Okay, I'll call up
the cab company,

16:36.162 --> 16:38.330
see if we can retrace
her whereabouts.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.449
Are you sure you don't want
to talk about it?

16:40.483 --> 16:42.567
Positive!

16:42.601 --> 16:44.052
Beckett.
Yo.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.021
We just got the phone records
back on our vics.

16:46.055 --> 16:47.689
Turns out they did have
a connection.

16:47.724 --> 16:49.691
They both received phone calls
from the same number

16:49.742 --> 16:51.627
within hours of their deaths.
Were you able to run it down?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.562
Yeah, it traced back
to a Todd McCutchin.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.380
He's got priors including
robbery and domestic assault.

16:56.429 --> 16:58.530
You got an address?
Yeah, we got an address.

16:58.581 --> 17:00.382
Let me see your hands!

17:00.417 --> 17:03.185
I said let me see your h--

17:04.637 --> 17:06.855
Oh, hi.

17:23.017 --> 17:25.068
I can explain.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.387
Turn around.
Oh, would you just listen to me, please?

17:27.422 --> 17:29.389
Why? You don't listen to me.

17:29.407 --> 17:31.309
Look, I was doing some digging
around on my own.

17:31.345 --> 17:32.148
That's not a crime, is it?

17:32.158 --> 17:34.858
No, but criminal trespassing is,
and so is murder.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.807
I was just trying to help.
I don't need your help.

17:36.817 --> 17:38.017
How did you get here anyway?

17:38.606 --> 17:40.541
I was following up a lead,
same as you.

17:40.551 --> 17:42.851
Oh, really? So you subpoenaed
the victims' phone records

17:42.966 --> 17:45.801
and looked for commonalities?
No, not exactly.

17:45.835 --> 17:48.803
Then what?

17:49.634 --> 17:52.553
Ow! Okay! I star-6-9'ed.
I star-6-9'ed.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.655
You star-69'ed?
Yes, on Maya's phone.

17:54.689 --> 17:56.924
I figured it would give me
her last call.

17:56.958 --> 17:59.693
It rang up McCutchin here. I got
his name from his voice mail,

17:59.728 --> 18:02.430
and then I did a Web search.
Tell me you're not impressed.

18:02.464 --> 18:04.365
You went
to an active crime scene

18:04.399 --> 18:06.434
without authorization.

18:06.468 --> 18:08.135
Uh...

18:08.170 --> 18:09.603
Yeah.

18:09.621 --> 18:11.072
But I wore gloves.

18:11.106 --> 18:12.440
Yo, Beckett.

18:12.474 --> 18:14.975
His body's cold.
He's been dead for hours.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.162
See? I didn't kill him.

18:18.213 --> 18:19.580
Slugs?

18:19.614 --> 18:21.549
We'll have to run ballistics,

18:21.583 --> 18:24.318
but the entry wounds are
the same size as our other vics.
Odd.

18:24.352 --> 18:27.037
What?
Well, the guy's in vending machines.

18:27.388 --> 18:29.772
Not an obvious choice
to be running around

18:29.793 --> 18:31.376
with an artist
and a prep school teacher.

18:31.456 --> 18:32.839
Hmm.

18:36.621 --> 18:38.055
Okay, so let's get C.S.U.
down here

18:38.096 --> 18:39.864
to look for fibers and prints.

18:39.898 --> 18:41.766
And have them start looking
for commonalities

18:41.800 --> 18:43.351
between
the three crime scenes.

18:43.402 --> 18:44.902
Let's start digging
into their lives.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.938
If they were on the same
dating site, I want to know.

18:46.972 --> 18:49.657
If they were in the same
12-step program, I want to know.

18:49.708 --> 18:52.376
How can I help?

18:52.394 --> 18:55.229
Look, Castle,
I'm sorry about your friend.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.115
I really am, but that doesn't
mean that you can just show up

18:58.150 --> 19:00.418
and act like
nothing has happened.

19:00.864 --> 19:02.499
The truth is,
is if you wanted to come back,

19:02.566 --> 19:04.200
you would've already,
but you didn't.

19:04.225 --> 19:06.059
So let's just face it.
The only reason

19:06.093 --> 19:08.027
that you're here right now
is because you were

19:08.062 --> 19:10.296
at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

19:10.331 --> 19:13.166
You ever stop and think, maybe
I was waiting to hear from you?

19:13.200 --> 19:15.402
Do you know what
these bodies are? A sign.

19:15.436 --> 19:16.903
A sign?

19:16.937 --> 19:19.372
A sign.
A sign from the universe

19:19.407 --> 19:21.708
telling us we need
to solve this case together.

19:23.397 --> 19:26.599
You don't want to let
the universe down, do you?

19:26.634 --> 19:30.437
You're not gonna go away
no matter what I do, are you?

19:30.471 --> 19:33.006
I respect the universe.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.108
Okay. Fine.

19:35.738 --> 19:38.306
I will let you join me
on this <i>one</i> case

19:38.341 --> 19:41.309
as long as you promise
to do what I say when I say it

19:41.344 --> 19:43.512
and not to do
any investigating on your own.

19:43.579 --> 19:45.881
I promise.
You won't regret this.

19:45.915 --> 19:48.617
I already do.
Starting now.

19:54.196 --> 19:56.181
What is it
about the refrigerator?

19:56.233 --> 19:59.202
Is it the cold, the light
or the combination of the two?

19:59.236 --> 20:01.871
I can't sleep.
Ah, the boy.

20:01.905 --> 20:04.574
He finally called.
Great.

20:04.608 --> 20:06.209
I didn't answer.
Why not?

20:06.243 --> 20:08.144
I was mad. I thought
he'd leave a message,

20:08.178 --> 20:09.996
but he didn't.
So now what do I do?

20:10.030 --> 20:12.649
He knows I know he called.
But if call back right away,

20:12.683 --> 20:15.385
then clearly I'm admitting
I was waiting for his call.

20:15.419 --> 20:17.520
How long do I need to wait
to call him back,

20:17.554 --> 20:19.455
a day, at least a day,
maybe two?

20:19.490 --> 20:22.492
Maybe you should get
a new boyfriend and start over.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.941
You're not very good at this,
are you?

20:26.992 --> 20:30.027
Apparently not.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.319
Anything?

20:46.387 --> 20:48.772
Uh, we tracked down
Todd McCutchin's fiancÃ©e.

20:48.806 --> 20:50.173
She's on her way.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.976
You find anything
in their background checks?

20:55.329 --> 20:58.381
Well, we went as far back
as grade school,

20:58.416 --> 21:00.734
and nothing has popped yet.

21:00.785 --> 21:03.119
Hmm. Maybe they're
top CIA agents

21:03.153 --> 21:05.121
targeted for termination,
huh?

21:05.156 --> 21:07.524
CIA's a popular theory
with you.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.492
Yes, well,
law of averages demands

21:09.527 --> 21:11.728
that I'll eventually
be right.

21:11.762 --> 21:14.130
I've forgotten how helpful
your insights can be.

21:14.165 --> 21:15.882
Oh, yeah?

21:15.916 --> 21:18.868
I bet I figure out how they're
connected before you do.

21:20.104 --> 21:21.471
All right. You're on.

21:21.493 --> 21:24.328
But if I win,
you have to promise to go away

21:24.396 --> 21:27.899
and never interfere
with any of my cases again.

21:27.933 --> 21:31.402
Fine. And if I win...

21:31.436 --> 21:33.506
You have to take me back
as your partner.

21:33.516 --> 21:34.636
Deal.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.366
What if
they figure it out first?

21:42.950 --> 21:44.817
Nah.
Nah.

21:46.717 --> 21:47.836
What are you two
talking about?

21:47.919 --> 21:50.387
Castle was just apologizing
for not calling.

21:55.628 --> 21:58.296
So what'd you guys find?

21:58.331 --> 21:59.748
Forensics
that blood smear

21:59.799 --> 22:01.767
that Castle found
in Maya's apartment--

22:01.801 --> 22:03.869
it's a match to Todd McCutchin's.
And C.S.U. found

22:03.903 --> 22:05.804
some of McCutchin's blood
on Maya's shoe.

22:05.838 --> 22:07.173
Which means that your friend
was at his place

22:07.240 --> 22:08.741
either during
or after the murder.

22:08.751 --> 22:10.751
Ran down those cab receipts
from her pocket.

22:10.815 --> 22:12.116
According to the taxi company,
they picked her up

22:12.181 --> 22:13.715
outside McCutchin's apartment
yesterday morning,

22:13.749 --> 22:15.616
took her somewhere in the Bowery.
The Bowery?

22:15.651 --> 22:17.585
Yeah.
Then 20 minutes later,

22:17.619 --> 22:20.388
they picked her up and they
dropped her off at home.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.740
It was just after that
that she called me.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.692
Beckett,
McCutchin's fiancÃ©e is here.

22:24.727 --> 22:28.729
I'm sorry.
I've never seen them before.

22:29.445 --> 22:32.080
Are you sure?
Your fiancÃ© had a record.

22:32.131 --> 22:35.717
Is it possible he was involved
in... uh, anything illegal?

22:36.549 --> 22:38.617
Todd was a good man.

22:38.651 --> 22:41.119
I know he did some bad things
in the past, but...

22:41.154 --> 22:43.255
He got himself
his own business.

22:43.289 --> 22:44.990
He was totally legit now.

22:45.024 --> 22:47.326
Only...

22:47.360 --> 22:49.061
Only what?

22:49.095 --> 22:52.731
A couple months ago, Todd hurt
his back and couldn't work.

22:52.765 --> 22:56.234
The bank wanted to take away
his business, so...

22:56.269 --> 22:59.171
He borrowed some money from
a guy in the neighborhood.

22:59.205 --> 23:01.506
This guy...

23:01.541 --> 23:03.175
He's no good.

23:03.242 --> 23:05.610
Did he threaten Todd?

23:05.645 --> 23:08.480
Todd was making payments,
but he fell behind.

23:08.514 --> 23:11.867
A couple weeks back, the man
came to the house with a gun.

23:13.119 --> 23:15.037
He said
he was gonna kill Todd

23:15.071 --> 23:18.540
if he didn't pay back
what he owed.

23:18.575 --> 23:21.643
I loaned him money.
15 g's. So what?

23:21.678 --> 23:23.579
Mr. Carbino,
we have a witness

23:23.613 --> 23:26.215
who says that you threatened to kill him.
So?

23:26.249 --> 23:28.850
So now he's dead.

23:28.868 --> 23:30.502
Yeah, I could see that.

23:30.553 --> 23:32.521
Look, Detective, first off,

23:32.555 --> 23:34.923
15 g's is not an amount of money
worth killing for.

23:34.958 --> 23:36.758
Not unless you've exhausted
other avenues,

23:36.793 --> 23:38.293
to which I had not.

23:38.328 --> 23:40.095
And secondly,
and more to the point,

23:40.129 --> 23:44.199
your boy here, he paid me back
the entire sum plus interest.

23:44.233 --> 23:46.835
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

23:46.869 --> 23:48.770
No, I don't,
sweetheart.

23:48.805 --> 23:50.906
But that don't mean
it ain't true.

23:53.576 --> 23:55.827
His alibi checks.

23:55.878 --> 23:58.313
He was in Jersey
all day yesterday

23:58.348 --> 24:00.849
shopping at Short Hills
with the missus.

24:00.883 --> 24:03.552
Wow, lucky girl.
Doesn't mean he didn't do it.
He coulda hired someone.

24:04.509 --> 24:07.377
Yeah, to kill McCutchin,
but why Maya and Chloe?

24:07.395 --> 24:10.214
Maybe they witnessed the hit.
Maybe they cosigned the loan.

24:10.248 --> 24:12.216
Do we have
McCutchin's financials?

24:18.823 --> 24:21.225
Yeah, they should all
be up shortly. Why?

24:21.259 --> 24:24.228
Uh, well,
Carbino said that, uh,

24:24.839 --> 24:27.374
McCutchin paid off his debt
in full plus interest.

24:27.408 --> 24:28.776
I was just thinking,
that's a lot of money...

24:28.818 --> 24:30.219
For a guy in
the vending machine business.

24:30.274 --> 24:32.209
And I thought, maybe,
where did that money come from?

24:39.760 --> 24:42.161
You know, all of McCutchin's
accounts were overdrawn?

24:42.228 --> 24:46.649
And then suddenly, 2 weeks ago,
$9,500 appears in his savings.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.467
Two weeks ago?

24:48.502 --> 24:51.404
Yeah. On the, uh, the 7th.

24:53.114 --> 24:54.782
There was a deposit made
in Maya Santori's account

24:54.791 --> 24:57.926
on the 7th
for the same amount.

24:57.961 --> 25:00.913
What about Chloe Whitman?

25:00.964 --> 25:02.898
$9,500
deposited on the 7th.

25:02.932 --> 25:04.234
Which means they were all
receiving money

25:04.264 --> 25:07.199
from the same source.
And spending it in the same place.

25:07.234 --> 25:09.335
Both Maya Santori
and Chloe Whitman

25:09.369 --> 25:11.921
had charges on their credit card
for a place called K.C.B.C.--

25:11.955 --> 25:13.923
both of them
on the 9th and the 16th,

25:15.286 --> 25:17.272
both of them small amounts,
less than 20 bucks.

25:17.282 --> 25:19.082
Same thing with McCutchin.

25:19.848 --> 25:21.916
The restaurant where they met?
All right, call up the bank.

25:21.969 --> 25:24.704
Let's see if they can help us
track who made those deposits.

25:24.738 --> 25:26.239
And I'd like to contact
the credit card company

25:26.338 --> 25:28.789
to find out what this K.C.B.C. is.
On it.

25:36.263 --> 25:38.732
Don't think that this means
that you won the bet.

25:38.791 --> 25:40.792
All we know is that
they are connected.

25:40.810 --> 25:43.728
We still don't know how.

25:43.746 --> 25:45.464
I missed you, too.

26:01.197 --> 26:02.464
Hey.

26:02.498 --> 26:05.133
Bad news.
According to the banks,

26:05.198 --> 26:06.850
our victims' deposits
were made in cash.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.816
There's no way
to trace the payments.

26:08.850 --> 26:10.552
And since the deposits were
less than $10,000,

26:10.583 --> 26:13.051
there was no report made to the I.R.S.
Which means that our victims

26:13.085 --> 26:14.954
were most likely involved
in something illegal.

26:14.964 --> 26:15.764
Just so you know,
I got that from "Shot to Death."

26:15.788 --> 26:16.972
So?

26:18.878 --> 26:20.395
So...

26:20.429 --> 26:22.414
What illegal activity
involves vending machines,

26:22.465 --> 26:24.283
an artist and a High School teacher?
I know.

26:24.322 --> 26:26.442
Even the stuff I'm making up
in my head doesn't make sense.
the credit card companies.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.652
I talked to the credit card companies.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.401
K.C.B.C. bills through

26:30.422 --> 26:32.256
an Internet
card processing service.

26:32.290 --> 26:34.425
There's no address on file.
We can't even track it down?

26:34.459 --> 26:36.427
I didn't say that.

26:36.461 --> 26:39.663
There's no address on file,
but they do register the I.S.P.

26:39.698 --> 26:42.566
of every swiped card transaction
that goes through.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.501
So I had tech track it down.

26:44.536 --> 26:48.571
Whoever ran those charges
did it from this address.

26:49.056 --> 26:50.657
I got this.

26:50.691 --> 26:52.459
Castle, road trip.

26:53.928 --> 26:56.763
Uh, thank you.

26:58.783 --> 26:59.667
You sure this is the place?

26:59.730 --> 27:01.230
As sure as you are.

27:01.265 --> 27:03.716
This doesn't look like
a credit card kind of place.

27:03.734 --> 27:05.218
This looks more like

27:05.285 --> 27:07.220
a "get shot and robbed"
kind of place.

27:07.254 --> 27:09.522
There's...

27:13.627 --> 27:16.596
What are you doing?

27:16.630 --> 27:18.464
That was the number
on Chloe's hand.

27:18.499 --> 27:20.299
Ooh!

27:20.334 --> 27:22.201
She was here.

27:22.236 --> 27:25.238
<i>âª you give me fever âª</i>

27:29.960 --> 27:34.263
<i>âª In the morning âª</i>

27:34.298 --> 27:38.267
<i>âª what a lovely way to burn âª</i>

27:38.302 --> 27:41.253
<i>âª you give me fever âª</i>

27:41.271 --> 27:47.059
<i>âª fever, fever,</i>
<i>fever, fever, fever âª</i>

27:48.862 --> 27:50.696
<i>âª you give me fever âª</i>

27:50.731 --> 27:53.983
<i>âª never know</i>
<i>how much I love you âª</i>

27:54.034 --> 27:58.204
<i>âª never know how much I care âª</i>

27:58.238 --> 28:00.773
<i>âª when you put your arms</i>
<i>around me âª</i>

28:00.791 --> 28:03.793
<i>âª I get a fever</i>
<i>that's so hard to bear âª</i>

28:03.827 --> 28:05.461
<i>âª you give me fever âª</i>

28:05.496 --> 28:09.949
This place--it's like
the circus with alcohol.

28:09.967 --> 28:12.952
How have I never been here before?
You think this is crazy,

28:12.970 --> 28:15.254
you should see some of
the clubs I've been to.

28:15.288 --> 28:17.673
<i>âª</i>

28:17.724 --> 28:20.476
<i>âª yeah, you give me fever âª</i>

28:20.511 --> 28:22.011
What can I get you?

28:22.062 --> 28:24.597
Information.

28:24.631 --> 28:26.149
Do you recognize
these people?

28:26.183 --> 28:28.634
<i>âª</i>

28:28.652 --> 28:31.170
They're part of Kitty's burlesque troupe.
Kitty's troupe

28:31.205 --> 28:33.172
Kitty Canary.
She runs the place.

28:33.207 --> 28:36.809
And where can I find
this this Kitty?

28:36.827 --> 28:38.661
<i>âª</i>

28:38.695 --> 28:42.314
<i>âª you give me fever âª</i>

28:53.459 --> 28:55.043
<i>âª</i>

28:55.078 --> 28:56.545
They're really dead?

28:56.579 --> 28:57.563
I'm afraid so.

28:57.574 --> 29:00.843
Your bartender said that they
were a part of your troupe.

29:00.878 --> 29:03.246
Chloe would dance
from time to time.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.514
Todd had a snake act.
What about Maya?

29:05.549 --> 29:07.967
She was more of a patron.
She came for inspiration.

29:08.001 --> 29:09.485
Hey, I just heard.

29:09.519 --> 29:11.520
Detective, this is
my husband Earl.

29:11.538 --> 29:13.923
He runs the burlesque with me.
Do you know what happened?

29:13.957 --> 29:15.958
We're looking into it.

29:15.993 --> 29:18.861
Right now, the only connection
that we can find is this club.

29:18.896 --> 29:21.697
Well, you don't think
someone here killed them?
How well did you know them?

29:21.732 --> 29:24.834
They were work friends.
You know, "hi, how are you?"

29:25.576 --> 29:27.477
Although Maya and Chloe
did come to the shop once

29:27.511 --> 29:30.446
to get tattoos.
My day job.

29:31.324 --> 29:33.859
Did the three of them spend
a lot of time together?

29:33.949 --> 29:35.118
No more so than anybody else.

29:35.128 --> 29:36.828
Did they spend a lot of time
with anyone else here?

29:37.030 --> 29:38.100
Not that I noticed.

29:38.180 --> 29:39.780
Do you have a mailing list
of your regulars?

29:40.141 --> 29:41.709
Yes. I can get a copy if you want.

29:41.719 --> 29:44.019
Yes, and I'll also need a list
of all of your employees

29:44.164 --> 29:46.065
and any other members
of your troupe.

29:46.099 --> 29:46.400
Of course.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.010
Can you think of
any other connection

29:48.053 --> 29:49.954
between the three of them?

29:50.021 --> 29:52.756
Well, there w--
there was the incident.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.959
<i>âª</i>

29:54.993 --> 29:57.344
A couple of weeks ago,
Chloe's boyfriend came around.

29:57.395 --> 29:59.296
Apparently, he didn't like
her dancing here.

30:00.654 --> 30:01.621
He got a little rough.

30:01.718 --> 30:04.020
Both Maya and Todd intervened.
Evan was drunk,

30:04.054 --> 30:05.721
yelling all kinds
of crazy stuff.

30:05.761 --> 30:06.878
What kind of stuff?

30:06.901 --> 30:08.703
"I know what you're doing.
I know all about it."

30:09.335 --> 30:12.037
I guess he thought she was
screwing someone else.

30:14.662 --> 30:17.564
Okay, so I followed Chloe
to the club that night,

30:17.599 --> 30:20.567
but only because she was
acting weird, secretive,

30:20.602 --> 30:22.636
and I thought she was seeing
another guy.

30:22.670 --> 30:24.755
Mr. Murphy, why didn't you
tell us this before?

30:24.806 --> 30:25.907
That I'd been fighting
with my girlfriend,

30:25.978 --> 30:28.079
that I'd threatened her?
I know how cops work.

30:29.201 --> 30:31.019
And when you found out
about the other victims,

30:31.070 --> 30:32.471
that they were all there at the club?
I didn't kill her.

30:32.553 --> 30:36.956
I didn't kill any of them.
What would you have done?

30:37.303 --> 30:39.137
I would try to help find
her killer.

30:39.172 --> 30:42.074
But if I had told you then
what you know now,

30:42.108 --> 30:44.176
would you have looked
any further than me?

30:44.210 --> 30:46.111
Mr. Murphy,
the money in Chloe's account,

30:46.145 --> 30:48.080
where did it come from?

30:49.667 --> 30:52.002
What money?

30:53.548 --> 30:56.317
So he admits to the fights
and the threats,

30:56.351 --> 30:57.820
but he claims not to know
anything about the money...

30:57.830 --> 30:59.530
Or how our victims
are connected

30:59.603 --> 31:01.537
other than the events
of that night.

31:01.571 --> 31:03.839
Do you believe him?
It doesn't matter what I believe.

31:03.907 --> 31:05.607
He's a viable suspect.
Hey, Ryan.

31:05.625 --> 31:09.345
I need you to get a search
warrant for Evan Murphy's place.

31:09.379 --> 31:11.180
And, Esposito, how are things
going over there?

31:11.214 --> 31:13.116
We ran the club's mailing list
for people with priors.

31:13.159 --> 31:14.827
These are the ones
that have popped so far.

31:16.680 --> 31:19.632
All right, run 'em for
any connections with our vics.
Right on.

31:21.396 --> 31:22.747
What?

31:22.823 --> 31:25.508
I've seen this guy's face.

31:32.166 --> 31:34.867
That's the same guy.

31:34.885 --> 31:37.370
Maya knew him.

31:37.405 --> 31:39.039
"Xander Doyle."

31:39.073 --> 31:41.274
Weapons charges,
conspiracy to distribute,

31:41.308 --> 31:44.144
and apparently,
he lives in the Bowery.

31:44.178 --> 31:47.080
How much you want to bet
Maya was on her way to see him

31:47.114 --> 31:48.965
after McCutchin's murder?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.450
Yeah, sure. I knew Maya.

31:50.468 --> 31:52.419
I met her at the club
a few months back.

31:52.453 --> 31:55.388
And what was
the nature of your relationship?

31:55.422 --> 31:57.741
She said she liked
the way I looked.

31:57.775 --> 31:59.192
You know how it goes.

31:59.226 --> 32:01.294
When was the last time
you saw her?

32:03.611 --> 32:05.746
Mr. Doyle, we have evidence
that indicates

32:05.764 --> 32:08.198
that Maya came to see you
the day she died.

32:08.233 --> 32:10.218
Look, she said she was
in trouble. She needed my help.

32:10.228 --> 32:11.548
What kind of trouble?

32:12.242 --> 32:14.176
She wouldn't say.

32:14.210 --> 32:16.161
Someone must have been
after her.

32:16.212 --> 32:18.130
And why would you say that?

32:18.181 --> 32:20.115
'Cause the reason
she came to see me is,

32:20.150 --> 32:21.717
she wanted to borrow a gun.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.660
That's why she was armed.

32:23.695 --> 32:25.446
She saw what happened to McCutchin.
She figured she'd be next.

32:25.508 --> 32:28.310
Mr. Doyle, did Maya give you
any indication

32:28.361 --> 32:30.763
as to what she might have
been involved in?

32:30.797 --> 32:32.765
No.
If I was a betting man...

32:34.398 --> 32:37.000
I ran into Maya
a few weeks ago on the street.

32:37.010 --> 32:39.978
She gave me a hug.
I could smell it.

32:40.013 --> 32:41.047
You could smell what?

32:41.059 --> 32:43.660
That sick smell--paint thinner,
acetone, bleach.

32:44.925 --> 32:47.693
I got a buddy who smells like
that. You know what he does?

32:47.728 --> 32:50.763
He makes meth.

32:51.901 --> 32:53.169
It's so obvious.

32:53.211 --> 32:55.479
I can't believe I didn't
think of it sooner.

32:55.513 --> 32:57.481
Do you really think
it was meth?

32:57.516 --> 32:59.033
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

32:59.086 --> 33:01.003
All of our victims
were struggling financially.

33:01.037 --> 33:03.472
One night after the club closes,
they're all together

33:03.506 --> 33:05.474
talking about their money woes

33:05.526 --> 33:07.927
until our High School
chemistry teacher cracks a smile

33:07.961 --> 33:09.946
and says, "well, we could
always make meth."

33:09.980 --> 33:11.414
But the others don't laugh.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.916
They say,
"yeah, we could make meth."

33:15.371 --> 33:18.122
Just like that cable show.

33:18.173 --> 33:20.575
I'm telling you, it's drugs.

33:20.609 --> 33:22.877
It's not drugs.
Are you sure?

33:22.911 --> 33:25.246
Yes, and your guy was right
about the chemicals.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.181
I found trace amounts
of bleach, acetone,

33:27.216 --> 33:30.184
sodium chloride and ammonia
on all three bodies.

33:30.219 --> 33:33.187
So how can you tell it's not drugs?
Because of what's missing.

33:33.222 --> 33:35.123
If your guys
had been cooking up meth

33:35.157 --> 33:36.424
or any other street-lab drugs,

33:36.459 --> 33:38.160
there would be
other substances present,

33:38.263 --> 33:40.731
not to mention the trace amounts
of the finished product.

33:40.765 --> 33:43.467
That being said, they definitely
were up to something.

33:43.501 --> 33:44.802
Hmm.

33:45.797 --> 33:47.398
Beckett.
Hey, it's Ryan.

33:47.432 --> 33:49.333
That search warrant on
Evan Murphy's place?

33:49.367 --> 33:50.801
It paid off.

33:50.835 --> 33:53.103
We found the murder weapon.

33:53.138 --> 33:55.674
I swear to God, I've never seen
that before in my life.

33:55.684 --> 33:57.184
Then what was it doing
in your place?

33:57.233 --> 33:58.101
I don't know!

33:58.111 --> 33:59.911
What really happened the night
that you followed Chloe

34:00.001 --> 34:01.769
to the club?
I told you, we fought.

34:01.805 --> 34:04.290
About what?
And do not say the affair.

34:04.344 --> 34:07.695
What were the four of you into?
Evan, what's the connection?

34:07.988 --> 34:09.922
Why did you kill them?

34:09.956 --> 34:13.126
I want a lawyer. I'm not saying
anything else without a lawyer.

34:17.067 --> 34:19.268
P.D.'s office has been notified.
They're sending someone over.

34:19.317 --> 34:21.485
Okay, notify the D.A.
Maybe they can cut us a deal

34:21.495 --> 34:24.297
and help us figure out
what was really going on.

34:31.225 --> 34:32.476
I know that look.

34:32.478 --> 34:33.911
What look?

34:33.929 --> 34:37.483
That "something doesn't add up"
look.

34:37.516 --> 34:40.485
It's just the lab report
on the murder weapon.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.521
What about it?

34:42.556 --> 34:44.373
They didn't find
any fingerprints.

34:44.407 --> 34:45.792
He probably wiped it down.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.703
Why would he wipe it down
if he was gonna hang on to it?

34:48.737 --> 34:51.539
Maybe he was going to ditch it
but didn't get around to it.
Mm.

34:51.572 --> 34:53.942
Ditching it would be the first
thing that he would do.

34:53.952 --> 34:55.351
Maybe he thought
he still needed it.

34:55.489 --> 34:57.691
To kill someone else?
Or protect himself.

34:59.660 --> 35:00.661
Hey, yo, Beckett.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.617
Financials came back
on your boy Evan.

35:02.651 --> 35:05.853
There's no unusual activity.
Maybe that was his motive.

35:05.887 --> 35:08.855
Whatever it was they were up to,
he didn't get his cut.

35:08.942 --> 35:11.527
But what was his cut? I mean,
what the hell were they into?

35:11.578 --> 35:13.462
It's like a bad joke--
a sculptor,

35:13.496 --> 35:15.447
a vending machine salesman
and a chemistry teacher

35:15.465 --> 35:17.149
walk into a burlesque bar.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.285
Yeah, only we don't
have a punch line.

35:19.313 --> 35:22.516
Other than they made a bunch of
money and got themselves killed.

35:24.203 --> 35:25.870
"Made a bunch of money."

35:25.905 --> 35:27.505
What?

35:27.540 --> 35:30.842
A sculptor who works
with metal, a chemist...

35:30.876 --> 35:33.345
And a vending machine
operator...

35:33.379 --> 35:36.314
I think I know
what our victims were up to.

35:36.349 --> 35:38.750
Do we still have
Chloe's purse?

35:43.172 --> 35:44.689
Whoa.

35:49.595 --> 35:52.263
What are you looking for?

35:53.799 --> 35:55.433
Aha!

35:57.233 --> 35:58.319
Take a look
at the serial numbers

35:58.362 --> 36:00.279
on those bills.

36:09.581 --> 36:10.349
They're the same.

36:10.384 --> 36:12.253
These bills are all pre-1998.

36:12.263 --> 36:13.963
That's before
they redesigned the currency.

36:13.992 --> 36:16.877
That's our punch line. That's
how these people are connected.

36:16.928 --> 36:19.997
In counterfeiting, the hardest
thing to make is the paper.

36:20.031 --> 36:21.949
But they had all the paper
they needed.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.435
They had an unlimited supply of $1 Bills.
From the vending machines.

36:25.470 --> 36:27.571
And those chemicals we found
on our victims' bodies...

36:27.605 --> 36:29.539
Were used to whitewash
the singles

36:29.574 --> 36:31.375
in order to make
blank bank notes.

36:31.409 --> 36:34.044
A procedure requiring
the expertise of a chemist.

36:34.078 --> 36:37.446
And what do counterfeiters <i>do</i>
with blank bank notes?

36:37.720 --> 36:39.204
Print larger denominations,

36:39.238 --> 36:41.206
for which they need
a metal press plate.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.409
And who better to provide that
than a sculptor?

36:44.443 --> 36:46.377
So...

36:46.412 --> 36:49.881
Plates, paper...

36:49.915 --> 36:52.150
There's only
one missing ingredient.

36:52.184 --> 36:55.153
I know who the killer is!
I know who the killer is!

37:02.394 --> 37:05.447
Come on. Let's go.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.105
Come on! Hurry up!

37:26.931 --> 37:30.534
Get the plates! The plates!

37:34.138 --> 37:36.306
Going somewhere?

37:38.593 --> 37:40.644
Let me see your hands.

37:42.630 --> 37:45.782
Step away from the bags
and walk forward.

37:56.380 --> 37:57.582
Yeah, they're fake.

37:57.661 --> 37:59.261
What gave me away?

37:59.296 --> 38:00.963
The missing ingredient.

38:00.997 --> 38:04.433
Ink. And who better to
provide it than a tattoo artist?

38:04.467 --> 38:05.901
That and Evan Murphy.

38:05.935 --> 38:08.937
You knew that we'd follow up
after you told us that story,

38:08.972 --> 38:11.473
so you planted that gun, but you
just didn't have enough time

38:11.491 --> 38:13.442
to put his prints on it,
did you?

38:13.476 --> 38:15.344
Sweep the area--
look out!

38:15.378 --> 38:17.012
Oh!

38:19.699 --> 38:22.835
Go! Go! Get him!
Move! Move! Move!
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

38:22.869 --> 38:24.787
He's over there!
Let's get him! Come on!

38:24.821 --> 38:27.489
Where's Kitty?
The money's gone.

38:28.674 --> 38:31.959
You stay here.
What if they come back?

38:52.064 --> 38:54.982
Hey! Hey!

39:01.240 --> 39:03.941
He's out here.
You got him?

39:03.976 --> 39:07.061
I think he went around
this way.

39:07.095 --> 39:10.348
Do you see him?
I don't see him.
I don't see him.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.550
Come on! Police!
Police!

39:12.584 --> 39:15.286
Show yourself. NYPD.
Come out.

39:35.841 --> 39:38.192
Castle,
down on the ground, now!

39:45.984 --> 39:47.818
Aah!
Aah! Oh-ohh-oh!

39:50.188 --> 39:51.622
Oh.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.667
Drop it. Drop it.

39:55.695 --> 39:58.530
Don't move.
Stay on the ground,
right where you are.

39:58.564 --> 40:02.667
Turn over. Stay where you are.
Don't touch the gun.

40:02.702 --> 40:04.335
Yeah.

40:05.821 --> 40:08.206
They hatched the plan
late one night at the club.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.642
They figured, victimless crime,
nobody would get hurt.

40:10.676 --> 40:12.911
Kitty and Earl would launder
the bills through the club

40:12.945 --> 40:14.846
and then make cash payments
to the others.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.781
It sounds like they had
a sweet deal going on.

40:16.816 --> 40:18.717
How'd it all go wrong?
Todd McCutchin.

40:18.751 --> 40:20.668
He was getting squeezed by
a loan shark, figured he'd try

40:20.703 --> 40:22.787
to make a payment
with counterfeit bills.

40:22.822 --> 40:24.756
The shark threatened
to rat him out

40:24.790 --> 40:26.025
unless he turned over
the operation.

40:26.227 --> 40:28.678
Maya and Chloe were willing,
but Kitty and Earl weren't.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.034
And when Todd confronted them,

40:31.069 --> 40:32.553
he had no idea
who he was dealing with.

40:32.604 --> 40:35.221
Kitty Canary,
A.K.A. Carla Breezer.

40:35.376 --> 40:37.393
She was a stripper in Seattle.

40:37.428 --> 40:39.312
She did a nickel
for a manslaughter charge

40:39.363 --> 40:41.297
for trying to run over
her boyfriend.

40:41.332 --> 40:43.699
When she got out, she got
a new name, new boyfriend

40:43.717 --> 40:45.668
and even changed coasts.

40:45.736 --> 40:48.171
She wasn't the type of girl
to let Todd take her down.

40:48.205 --> 40:49.639
They had everything
they needed--

40:49.657 --> 40:51.073
the chemical formulas,
the plates.

40:51.091 --> 40:53.443
All they had to do
was get rid of the others.

40:53.477 --> 40:55.378
Nice work, you two.
Very impressive.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.280
But tomorrow, I want you
to tell me the story

40:57.314 --> 40:59.682
about how Castle got your gun.

41:01.485 --> 41:05.655
So, uh...
I guess you won the bet.

41:05.689 --> 41:07.256
Yeah.

41:08.659 --> 41:11.110
But look, if you don't
want me to--

41:11.145 --> 41:14.731
no, no, no. No.
You won fair and square.

41:17.701 --> 41:20.003
So...

41:21.828 --> 41:23.896
See you tomorrow?

41:23.930 --> 41:26.064
See you tomorrow.

41:30.587 --> 41:32.537
So...

41:32.555 --> 41:34.206
How long before Castle

41:34.240 --> 41:36.592
did you know this was
about counterfeiting?

41:36.626 --> 41:39.545
âª Aching,
caught in a hurricane âª

41:39.579 --> 41:41.213
âª it's taking âª

41:41.247 --> 41:44.450
âª every muscle to move again âª

41:44.484 --> 41:46.452
âª and sleepless nights âª

41:47.620 --> 41:49.071
âª Lazy sundays âª

41:49.105 --> 41:50.572
uh-huh. Thank you.

41:50.607 --> 41:53.058
âª Heavy eyes,
it's a case of the mondays âª

41:53.076 --> 41:54.559
is that...

41:54.577 --> 41:57.062
Yeah. She's been on the phone
for over an hour.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.965
So who called whom first?
What's it matter...

41:59.999 --> 42:03.051
As long as they connected?

42:03.086 --> 42:05.070
âª Do, do, do âª

42:05.104 --> 42:07.172
Thank you.
