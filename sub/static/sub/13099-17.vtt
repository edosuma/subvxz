you've had a rough day.

00:28.417 --> 00:29.583
[sighs]

00:29.667 --> 00:30.875
You try an eight-hour session

00:30.958 --> 00:33.000
with the League
of Non-aligned Worlds.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.542
They're thinking about
banning both the Narn

00:34.625 --> 00:37.667
and the Centauri
from the Corridor.

00:37.750 --> 00:39.417
There's been a few incidents
around the trade gates.

in the Triangle.

'Fair ball.'

00:48.167 --> 00:49.708
"Triangle"?

00:49.792 --> 00:51.250
Grey Sector.

00:51.333 --> 00:52.750
Ever since B-5 went online

00:52.833 --> 00:55.250
there's been all kinds
of stories about the place.

00:55.333 --> 00:58.583
Strange lights, weird noises,
people vanishing.

00:58.667 --> 01:02.458
Maintenance nicknamed it
the "B-5 Triangle."

01:02.542 --> 01:03.708
Now they swear
there's something

01:03.792 --> 01:05.708
making their scanners
go haywire.

01:07.583 --> 01:08.500
'Foul ball.'

01:08.583 --> 01:10.250
Anything to the stories?

01:10.333 --> 01:12.458
Yeah, every station
has its phantoms.

01:12.542 --> 01:14.458
Personally, I've never
seen anything down there

01:14.542 --> 01:16.667
but it is, you know,
kinda creepy.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.292
Well, in that case, I'll have
to take a look for myself.

- Why?
- 'Curiosity.'

01:24.708 --> 01:26.083
Look, when I was a kid

01:26.167 --> 01:28.917
I used to love to wander
through all those creepy places.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.792
I mean, uh, haunted houses,
forbidden paths

01:31.875 --> 01:33.417
Indian burial grounds.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.250
It was like candy.
I couldn't get enough of them.

01:35.333 --> 01:37.250
Just don't go in there alone,
okay?

01:37.333 --> 01:38.917
Oh that's half the fun of it.

[chuckles]

01:51.083 --> 01:53.167
No, no, no, Vir.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.958
You can't even begin
to compare the compositions

01:56.042 --> 01:58.333
of Trentara with those of Dorva.

01:58.417 --> 01:59.792
But, Londo, Dorva is fun.

01:59.875 --> 02:01.583
Fun? Fun?

02:01.667 --> 02:04.542
The man was a giant
of Centauri Opera.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.958
His opening Aria
"Ducata"?

02:09.042 --> 02:11.542
Please. This is one
of the most brilliant

02:11.625 --> 02:14.833
soul-stirring piece of music
ever written.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.750
[singing in Centauri]

02:27.000 --> 02:28.375
That's very commendable, Londo

02:28.458 --> 02:30.125
and you sing it quite well.

02:30.208 --> 02:35.542
But it cannot stand beside
"Mi Quirva Tara."

02:55.792 --> 02:57.417
Oh, Vir.

02:57.500 --> 03:01.042
They don't write them
like that anymore.

03:01.125 --> 03:03.625
How fitting you should die

03:03.708 --> 03:07.208
with a song on your lips,
Mollari.

(male narrator)
The Babylon Project was our
last best hope for peace.

03:16.333 --> 03:19.083
A self-contained world
five-miles long

03:19.167 --> 03:21.083
located in neutral territory.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.917
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

03:27.000 --> 03:30.750
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

03:30.833 --> 03:33.833
A shining beacon in space..

03:33.917 --> 03:36.042
...all alone in the night.

03:36.125 --> 03:39.500
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

03:39.583 --> 03:43.792
The year the Great War
came upon us all.

03:43.875 --> 03:48.042
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.083
The year is 2259.

03:50.167 --> 03:53.458
The name of the place
is "Babylon 5."

04:39.250 --> 04:40.875
Who are you?

04:40.958 --> 04:43.875
Your doom, Paso Leati.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.167
Paso Leati?

04:47.250 --> 04:49.083
- Urza?
- Londo.

04:49.167 --> 04:51.583
Urza!

04:51.667 --> 04:54.750
How good it is to see
your sad face again.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.208
Yes, you almost saw it
for the last time.

04:57.292 --> 05:00.250
By all the Gods, never play
a trick like that on me again.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.167
- Forgive me.
- As always.

05:02.250 --> 05:05.875
Vir, I want you to meet
an old friend of mine.

05:05.958 --> 05:08.292
This is Urza Jaddo.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.708
Excuse me.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.750
Vocator Urza Jaddo

05:11.833 --> 05:13.667
hero of the Battle of Gorash

05:13.750 --> 05:16.292
and the finest swordsman
in the Couro Prido

05:16.375 --> 05:17.875
next to me, of course.

05:17.958 --> 05:21.792
Urza, Vir Cotto, my attache.

05:21.875 --> 05:24.208
Now we shall go back
to my quarters

05:24.292 --> 05:26.542
open a bottle of fine Brivari

05:26.625 --> 05:28.417
and you shall tell me
what happy miracle

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
has brought you here
to Babylon 5.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.708
Alas, I must decline
for the moment.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.333
The journey from
Centauri Prime was long.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.583
There are things
I must attend to.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.083
But later..

05:38.167 --> 05:40.417
...we will talk of many things

05:40.500 --> 05:42.750
and drink deeply
of your fine Brivari.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.333
I look forward to it.

Hey.

06:48.708 --> 06:49.875
You alright?

06:52.583 --> 06:54.125
Oh, Jesus.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.458
[beeping]

06:57.542 --> 06:59.250
Sheridan to Garibaldi.

07:01.625 --> 07:02.833
(Michael on radio)
'Garibaldi.'

07:02.917 --> 07:04.833
Chief, I'm in Grey 10.

07:04.917 --> 07:05.917
I've just found a..

07:06.000 --> 07:08.750
[static]

07:10.292 --> 07:12.083
Chief? Chief!

07:12.167 --> 07:14.000
(Michael on radio)
'Captain, I can't read you.'

07:14.083 --> 07:16.625
'Send again. Send again.'

07:16.708 --> 07:17.833
Garibaldi, I can't read you.

07:17.917 --> 07:18.833
There must be..

07:18.917 --> 07:20.167
[screams]

07:26.250 --> 07:27.708
(Michael on radio)
'Captain, you alright?'

07:29.792 --> 07:31.500
Yeah. I'm okay.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.083
Just get down here
as soon as you can.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.042
Your epinephrine level's
a bit elevated

07:42.125 --> 07:44.708
but that's consistent
with a sudden state of shock.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.792
Could use a little rest,
otherwise you're fine.

07:46.875 --> 07:49.833
Shock's a pretty mild word
for it, doc.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.708
I've been attacked
by aliens before

07:51.792 --> 07:53.125
but never by dead ones.

07:53.208 --> 07:54.458
So maybe next time
you'll listen

07:54.542 --> 07:57.375
when I tell you not
to do something.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.375
Sir.

07:59.458 --> 08:02.542
No, I-I'd say the attack
was a simple..

08:02.625 --> 08:04.167
...postmortem reaction.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.917
Dead bodies build up
deposits of gas

08:06.000 --> 08:07.292
which can cause them
to emit sounds

08:07.375 --> 08:08.708
or move as if
they're still alive.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.625
Oh, that's cute,
a zombie with a gas attack.

08:10.708 --> 08:11.542
[chuckles]

08:11.625 --> 08:13.042
Any idea what killed him?

08:13.125 --> 08:16.250
Well, at first glance,
I'd say massive head trauma

08:16.333 --> 08:19.042
but I'll have to do an autopsy.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.708
Alright, can you identify him?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.542
Oh, that's easy.

08:22.625 --> 08:24.417
His name's..

08:24.500 --> 08:27.417
Sush na, uh, something or other.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.083
Yeah.

08:29.167 --> 08:31.583
- "Chay-yosh-nay."
Gesundheit.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.000
[sighs]

08:33.083 --> 08:34.875
He came in three days ago
from the Corridor

08:34.958 --> 08:37.583
registered a cargo.
Supposed to depart tomorrow.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.292
He's been staying
in the Markab Sector.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.250
Alright. You and I will
go through his quarters.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.542
Send a detail
to check out his..

08:44.625 --> 08:45.833
Captain?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.833
Are you alright?

08:51.917 --> 08:53.583
I just felt a little
dizzy there.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.417
[chuckles]

08:55.500 --> 08:56.625
Maybe the doc is right about me

08:56.708 --> 08:58.375
needing some rest.

08:58.458 --> 08:59.583
Okay, look,
I'll handle the search.

08:59.667 --> 09:00.833
You cop a little sack time

09:00.917 --> 09:02.875
and I'll let you know
what we find.

09:10.208 --> 09:13.000
[humming]

09:18.208 --> 09:20.708
So how long have you
and Vocator Jaddo

09:20.792 --> 09:21.792
known each other?

09:21.875 --> 09:23.125
Oh, ever since we were children.

09:23.208 --> 09:24.958
But our houses have been allied

09:25.042 --> 09:27.375
since the earliest days
of the Republic.

09:27.458 --> 09:30.042
Why does he call you
Paso Leati?

09:30.125 --> 09:32.792
In dueling societies,
it is customary for each member

09:32.875 --> 09:35.708
to be given a fighting name
by his comrades.

09:35.792 --> 09:39.000
They said I fought
like a crazed Leati

09:39.083 --> 09:41.583
and so they called me
Paso Leati.

09:41.667 --> 09:45.167
Urza was known as Skal Tura

09:45.250 --> 09:46.875
the silent beast.

09:46.958 --> 09:48.750
Well, those were great times
Vir.

09:48.833 --> 09:52.083
We were young, proud, fierce..

09:52.167 --> 09:54.667
...bursting to prove ourselves

09:54.750 --> 09:57.167
to each other
and to the world.

09:57.250 --> 10:00.500
As our ships ruled
the spaceways

10:00.583 --> 10:02.667
and our power was rivaled

10:02.750 --> 10:05.125
by that of the Gods only.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.375
Uh, Great Maker

10:07.458 --> 10:09.917
it was good to be
a Centauri then.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.250
Every generation
of Centauri mourns

10:12.333 --> 10:15.708
for the golden days when their
power was like unto the gods.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.208
It-it's counterproductive.

10:17.292 --> 10:20.667
I mean, why make history
if you fail to learn by it?

10:20.750 --> 10:23.583
You know, Vir,
you have what the Earthers call

10:23.667 --> 10:25.792
a negative personality.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.250
No, I don't.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.750
There. You see?

10:32.500 --> 10:33.500
Oh, delightful.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.000
Urza will be pleased.

10:35.083 --> 10:38.208
In the old days,
his capacity for Brivari

10:38.292 --> 10:39.667
was almost legendary.

10:39.750 --> 10:40.958
[door beeps]

10:42.792 --> 10:43.958
Enter!

10:46.167 --> 10:48.083
Paso Leati

10:48.167 --> 10:50.208
my heart leaps
to see you again.

10:50.292 --> 10:51.625
No more than does mine

10:51.708 --> 10:55.417
my good and dear friend
Skal Tura.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.042
- The Brivari.
- Yes!

11:01.125 --> 11:03.708
And you will not
be disappointed.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.417
Val'tu.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.833
Val'tu.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.750

[zapping]

12:45.500 --> 12:47.667
What?

12:47.750 --> 12:49.667
Captain?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:49.750 --> 12:50.667
You okay?

12:50.750 --> 12:52.500
[panting]

12:52.583 --> 12:55.583
Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.417
How'd you get here so fast?

12:58.500 --> 12:59.875
I was on my way
with the forensics report

12:59.958 --> 13:02.875
when E-systems picked up
gunfire in your quarters.

13:02.958 --> 13:05.333
- Yeah.
- What happened?

13:05.417 --> 13:06.667
It was here.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.250
It attacked me.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.583
What?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.542
A Grylor.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.708
It's an animal
native to Janos 7.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.625
I was stalked by one once.

13:18.708 --> 13:19.792
Yeah.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.167
'It almost killed me here.'

13:24.125 --> 13:26.417
I shot it.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.375
It must have been a nightmare.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.083
No, no, no, no.

13:31.167 --> 13:32.792
No, it was no nightmare.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.625
I saw it.

13:36.958 --> 13:38.542
At least I think I did.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.500
[sighs]
Hey, it happens.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.042
I mean, I once saw
a whole chorus line

13:42.125 --> 13:44.875
of purple wombats doing
show tunes in my bathtub.

13:44.958 --> 13:48.417
Of course, I was pretty drunk
at the time.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.458
Yeah.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.792
[clears throat]
So what does forensics say?

13:54.875 --> 13:56.083
Suicide.

13:56.167 --> 13:57.250
Are you telling me he bashed

13:57.333 --> 13:58.958
his own skull in?

13:59.042 --> 14:01.083
Yeah. Against the pipe
where you found him.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.917
Doc picked half of it
out of his brainpan.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.042
Any idea why?

14:04.125 --> 14:05.625
No. Not a clue.

14:05.708 --> 14:07.458
I mean, bioscans
were all normal.

14:08.958 --> 14:12.750
Oh, no. Maybe he was in a
religious.. A religious frenzy.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.417
The Markab have rituals
in which they lose

14:14.500 --> 14:15.667
all control of themselves.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.417
That's possible,
except those rituals

14:17.500 --> 14:18.917
usually involve psychotropics.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.500
This guy's system was clean.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.375
And besides, why would he
go to Grey Sector

14:22.458 --> 14:24.417
to practice his religion?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.708
I don't know.

14:32.167 --> 14:34.292
You keep checking.
I want answers.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.083
I'll be in C and C
if you need me.

14:45.708 --> 14:46.875
I kind of like it.

14:51.042 --> 14:53.833
[laughter]

14:56.208 --> 14:58.333
And what about you?

14:58.417 --> 15:00.292
'Are you still married
to Marilya?'

15:00.375 --> 15:02.583
We are comfortable
with each other.

15:03.542 --> 15:04.625
She understands.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.583
Well, I'm happy for you

15:06.667 --> 15:07.833
and jealous.

15:07.917 --> 15:12.333
Aw, after all these years,
Paso Leati..

15:12.417 --> 15:14.250
...have you still not found
love?

15:14.333 --> 15:18.292
Oh, there was someone,
a dancer named Adira.

15:18.792 --> 15:19.667
And?

15:19.750 --> 15:22.333
Oh, it ended as all love does.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.417
Badly.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.417
[chuckling]

15:26.500 --> 15:28.208
Listen to me.

15:28.292 --> 15:32.000
Moaning about dead passions
like an old drunk.

15:32.083 --> 15:35.125
You know what I need?
A drink.

15:35.208 --> 15:36.917
A drink!

15:37.000 --> 15:39.083
[both laughing]

15:42.792 --> 15:46.792
Your name is spoken often
on Centauri Prime these days.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.250
Oh, yes?

15:48.333 --> 15:51.333
And what do they say about me
when they speak my name?

15:51.417 --> 15:53.000
That your star..

15:53.083 --> 15:55.333
...is once again in ascendance

15:55.417 --> 15:56.792
'as is the Republic's.'

15:56.875 --> 15:58.667
Well, it's about time.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.208
The Centauri have bowed
to the, to the whims

16:01.292 --> 16:02.875
of other races for too long.

16:02.958 --> 16:07.042
Now, we will show
the galaxy our true spirit.

16:07.125 --> 16:08.917
Beginning with those..

16:09.000 --> 16:11.708
...those thrice-damned Narn.

16:11.792 --> 16:15.542
Emperor Turhan,
may the Gods comfort him

16:15.625 --> 16:18.000
never wanted another war
with the Narn.

16:18.083 --> 16:21.250
The emperor was a good man
but he was wrong about the Narn.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.875
War with them was inevitable.

16:23.958 --> 16:26.083
They have given us little choice
in the matter.

16:26.167 --> 16:29.375
The Narn did not
start this conflict.

16:29.458 --> 16:31.875
They were forced into it
by a faction

16:31.958 --> 16:33.875
within our own midst.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.625
The same faction

16:35.708 --> 16:37.875
who murdered
Prime Minister Malachi

16:37.958 --> 16:40.042
and put that infantile puppet

16:40.125 --> 16:43.083
Cartagia on the throne!

16:43.167 --> 16:45.167
I was told Malachi
took his own life

16:45.250 --> 16:46.458
when the emperor passed away.

16:46.542 --> 16:48.917
(Urza)
'That's the official story.'

16:49.000 --> 16:52.167
Many such lies
are told nowadays.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.375
Why do you tell me this, Urza?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.083
A resolution..

17:05.167 --> 17:07.542
...is about to be brought
before the Centaurum..

17:09.500 --> 17:13.042
...declaring me and my house

17:13.125 --> 17:15.167
traitors to the Republic.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.208
No. You're joking.

17:17.292 --> 17:19.250
They could never prove
such a thing.

17:19.333 --> 17:23.042
These days, the mere accusation
is enough.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.500
I am a marked man, Londo

17:26.583 --> 17:29.875
and if these villains
have their way

17:29.958 --> 17:32.958
I will be disgraced.

17:33.042 --> 17:35.458
And you know what that means.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.625
What do you want me to do?

17:44.417 --> 17:47.958
You were always clever, Londo.

17:48.042 --> 17:50.750
And House Mollari is still
one of the most respected

17:50.833 --> 17:52.583
of the noble houses.

17:54.458 --> 17:57.333
If you stand with me..

17:58.333 --> 18:01.667
...I know I can save my family.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.833
I'll do what I can.

18:08.167 --> 18:12.333
I knew you would not deny me,
Paso Leati.

18:14.292 --> 18:15.750
And now I must go.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.000
Tomorrow I will
arrange a banquet

18:18.083 --> 18:20.917
to celebrate our reunion.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.625
I thank you
for the fine Brivari

18:24.708 --> 18:26.583
and your friendship.

18:34.833 --> 18:37.625
[indistinct chatter]

18:42.083 --> 18:43.500
Commander.

18:43.583 --> 18:44.750
Everything in order?

18:44.833 --> 18:45.792
Remarkably so.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.292
It's beginning to worry me.

18:47.375 --> 18:50.208
Oh, you always worry when
things are going well?

18:50.292 --> 18:52.375
I don't have time to worry
about them when they're not.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.292
Jumpgate online.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.375
(Susan)
'It's the Arkati.'

19:02.458 --> 19:05.125
She's preregistered.
Route her to Bay 8.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.625
[indistinct chatter]

19:28.292 --> 19:30.542
- What the hell?
- Sir?

19:31.833 --> 19:33.792
Anna.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.750
[explosion]

19:38.000 --> 19:40.125
Captain, what is it?

19:40.208 --> 19:42.042
Station 6, go to hyper track.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.083
I want that whole area scanned
right now.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.542
What area, sir?

19:48.667 --> 19:50.250
Captain?

19:50.333 --> 19:51.708
'Something wrong?'

20:01.208 --> 20:03.583
I..

20:03.667 --> 20:05.417
I have to see to something.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.833
[instrumental music]

20:22.875 --> 20:27.583
And then in C and C,
I...I saw the Icarus.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.792
The Icarus?

20:29.875 --> 20:31.042
Yeah.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.667
It was a science ship,
my wife was aboard.

20:37.417 --> 20:39.458
I saw it explode
as if I were there.

20:39.542 --> 20:43.250
Doc, it happened over
two years ago and..

20:43.333 --> 20:44.958
...I wasn't there.

20:45.042 --> 20:48.083
Look, I have run you through
every test that I know.

20:48.167 --> 20:51.875
There is nothing wrong
with you...organically.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.500
Oh, great.
Then I'm just plain nuts.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.833
Well, anyone willing
to command Babylon 5

20:56.917 --> 20:58.667
has got to be
slightly insane

20:58.750 --> 21:02.208
but I don't think that you're
ready for the asylum just yet.

21:03.458 --> 21:06.000
Then what is wrong with me?

21:06.083 --> 21:08.708
Well, it's possible you picked
up some kind of new virus

21:08.792 --> 21:12.292
from the corpse, somethin'
our scanners can't spot.

21:12.375 --> 21:15.292
I know a good Markab doctor.
I'll check with him.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.542
There might be
a simpler explanation.

21:19.625 --> 21:20.958
Seven months ago,
you were commanding

21:21.042 --> 21:22.250
in a starship on the rim, right?

21:22.333 --> 21:23.917
- Yeah.
- Alright.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.208
Suddenly you're put
in charge of a small city

21:26.292 --> 21:28.250
in space just as
a major war breaks out.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.000
Your diet changes, your sleep
is constantly interrupted

21:31.083 --> 21:32.667
you face a major crisis
every other day

21:32.750 --> 21:34.708
and to top it all off,
you're not sure

21:34.792 --> 21:37.500
you can trust the very
people who put you here.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.125
Now that's a lot of stress.

21:41.292 --> 21:43.208
Maybe you're sending
yourself a message.

21:44.917 --> 21:47.125
I'll put you on medical leave
for a few days.

21:47.208 --> 21:48.917
Oh, no, no. Impossible.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.375
I have a station to run.

21:50.458 --> 21:53.000
Well, Commander Ivanova
is quite capable of doing that.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.667
- I want you to relax.
- No.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.167
Let other people handle
things for a little while.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.375
Give me your hand.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.375
This is going to monitor
any abnormalities

21:59.458 --> 22:00.458
in your system functions.

22:00.542 --> 22:01.542
Oh, doc.

22:01.625 --> 22:03.250
And I'm also prescribing
a mild sedative.

22:03.333 --> 22:06.292
I want you to relax
and enjoy yourself.

22:06.375 --> 22:08.125
That is an order.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.958
You know, you're just
like your father.

22:16.458 --> 22:18.083
Well, thank you.

22:19.208 --> 22:21.167
(Londo)
'Refa, at last.'

22:21.250 --> 22:23.333
Taking care of our
mutual interests

22:23.417 --> 22:25.375
consumes much of my time.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.083
What can I do for you, Mollari?

22:27.167 --> 22:29.125
I am told Vocator Jaddo

22:29.208 --> 22:31.917
will be declared a traitor
by the Centaurum?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.417
(Refa)
'He is a traitor.'

22:33.500 --> 22:35.042
Don't be a fool.

22:35.125 --> 22:37.250
Urza may differ
with a few politicians

22:37.333 --> 22:39.625
but he would never betray
the Republic.

22:39.708 --> 22:41.708
I will vouch for him
personally.

22:41.792 --> 22:44.083
Have you said this publicly?

22:44.167 --> 22:45.333
It will not be necessary.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.458
I want the resolution dropped.

22:47.542 --> 22:49.250
It is already accomplished.

22:49.333 --> 22:51.583
Well, then unaccomplish it.

22:51.667 --> 22:54.083
Urza is a friend,
more than a friend.

22:54.167 --> 22:55.583
He is a dueling comrade.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.542
My house and his
have been allies

22:57.625 --> 23:00.292
since the earliest days
of the Republic.

23:00.375 --> 23:02.458
I will stand up for him.

23:02.542 --> 23:04.417
That is unfortunate.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.458
I'm afraid
the political repercussions

23:06.542 --> 23:08.708
will be very grave.

23:08.792 --> 23:10.625
House Jaddo is crumbling

23:10.708 --> 23:13.417
and anyone who defends it
will crumble as well.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.583
We'll try and protect you,
of course

23:15.667 --> 23:20.000
but if your link
with this man gets out..

23:20.083 --> 23:23.333
...you may no longer
fit in with our plans.

23:23.417 --> 23:26.125
plans?

23:26.208 --> 23:27.583
Perhaps you are forgetting

23:27.667 --> 23:30.375
who made your plan
a reality.

23:30.458 --> 23:32.250
'And how it was done.'

23:32.333 --> 23:34.833
Mollari, if you insist
on clinging

23:34.917 --> 23:38.875
to the coat of a doomed man,
there is little I can do.

23:40.417 --> 23:42.708
But, I will try.

23:42.792 --> 23:44.542
Yes.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.958
You know,
on rare occasions

23:48.042 --> 23:50.583
I am proud to be
attache.

23:50.667 --> 23:51.875
Be careful, Vir.

23:51.958 --> 23:55.417
Such compliments will turn
my head. Get me a drink.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.875
And then contact all my agents

23:56.958 --> 23:58.500
on Centauri Prime.

23:58.583 --> 23:59.792
It's time I paid
more attention

23:59.875 --> 24:02.250
to what's happening
on homeworld.

24:05.917 --> 24:07.750
[automated message]
'Foul ball.'

24:12.708 --> 24:14.083
'Foul ball.'

24:14.167 --> 24:15.375
Captain.

24:15.458 --> 24:16.792
Mr. Garibaldi.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.625
Is there something wrong?

24:18.708 --> 24:21.708
No. Just, uh, wanted to see
how you were doing.

24:21.792 --> 24:23.250
Better. A lot better.

24:23.333 --> 24:26.417
You know, I almost forgot
what it's like to just relax.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.458
If you call three straight hours
of batting practice relaxing.

24:29.542 --> 24:30.875
Does the term
"Obsessive-compulsive"

24:30.958 --> 24:32.083
ring a bell?

24:32.167 --> 24:33.792
[automated message]
'Holding pitch.'

24:34.542 --> 24:36.042
Yeah.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.167
Did you find out anything
more about that Markab?

24:38.250 --> 24:39.458
No, not really.

24:39.542 --> 24:40.833
Every check confirms
he was just

24:40.917 --> 24:42.542
your average business type.

24:42.625 --> 24:44.208
There is one thing.

24:44.292 --> 24:46.208
He came through Sector 14
on his way here.

24:46.292 --> 24:48.625
Sector 14?
Isn't that restricted?

24:48.708 --> 24:50.042
That's right, ever since
the incident

24:50.125 --> 24:51.542
last year with Babylon 4.

24:51.625 --> 24:54.083
Babylon 4? I thought
that was destroyed.

24:54.167 --> 24:55.833
So did we, till we got
a signal from it.

24:55.917 --> 24:58.000
Wait a second, I never read
anything about this

24:58.083 --> 24:59.250
in the station logs.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.875
Well, that's because
Earthforce decided

25:00.958 --> 25:03.542
to confiscate all the records
for their investigation.

25:03.625 --> 25:05.542
'And B-4 was caught up
in some kind of weird'

25:05.625 --> 25:06.875
'space-time phenomenon.'

25:06.958 --> 25:08.208
'We managed to get
all its people off'

25:08.292 --> 25:09.917
before it disappeared again.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.625
But Earthforce believes
there's still some kind

25:11.708 --> 25:13.250
of anomaly out there.

25:13.333 --> 25:16.000
Maybe the Markab encountered it.

25:16.083 --> 25:18.208
Anyway, it's all here.

25:19.750 --> 25:21.833
I thought you said
the, uh, records

25:21.917 --> 25:22.917
were all confiscated.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.292
- I made a copy.
- Oh.

25:24.375 --> 25:27.000
You never know when I might
wanna write my memoirs..

25:29.333 --> 25:30.250
Thanks.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.250
Keep your elbow up.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.125
Oh, my.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.875
Yes. Magnificent.

25:53.958 --> 25:56.917
Urza always knew
how to throw a banquet.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.125
Come.

26:03.792 --> 26:06.042
- Urza.
- Welcome, Londo.

26:06.125 --> 26:07.208
You know Lord Valo.

26:07.292 --> 26:09.208
Lord Valo,
good to see you again.

26:09.292 --> 26:11.042
- Londo.
- My lady.

26:13.958 --> 26:15.708
A month ago he would
have grown horns

26:15.792 --> 26:17.000
rather than speak to me.

26:17.083 --> 26:18.708
He still may.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.917
- You must try the Japoti.
- Oh, yes. Please.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.542
I brought it fresh
from the homeworld.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.875
Oh, really?
Good. Good.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.042
Yes. Look.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.667
Oh, divine!

26:39.042 --> 26:40.833
To us!

26:40.917 --> 26:42.833
Old comrades well met.

26:42.917 --> 26:44.708
And to the Republic.

26:44.792 --> 26:46.667
To the republic.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.792
Quite an impressive
array of guests.

26:54.875 --> 26:56.333
Nobles every one, hmm?

26:56.417 --> 26:58.292
They are friends

26:58.375 --> 27:00.500
and when I announce
our alliance

27:00.583 --> 27:03.917
against those who seek
to dishonor my house

27:04.000 --> 27:05.542
and our Republic

27:05.625 --> 27:08.250
they will make sure
word is spread

27:08.333 --> 27:09.292
throughout the court.

27:09.375 --> 27:10.833
It'll not be necessary.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.042
I've taken care of it.

27:12.125 --> 27:13.417
What do you mean?

27:13.500 --> 27:16.250
Oh, you've asked for my help.
I've given it.

27:16.333 --> 27:19.250
No charges will be made
against you or your house.

27:19.333 --> 27:23.167
The resolution has already been
brought before the Centaurum.

27:23.250 --> 27:26.875
And my sources assure me
it will pass.

27:26.958 --> 27:29.042
Yeah, but that's not possible.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.375
Lord Refa promised.

27:30.458 --> 27:31.708
Refa?

27:34.083 --> 27:37.500
What do you have
to do with him?

27:37.583 --> 27:40.583
He is a friend,
a man of great influence.

27:40.667 --> 27:41.875
With his help, we--

27:41.958 --> 27:45.708
I will get no help
from that assassin.

27:45.792 --> 27:47.542
It was he who had
the resolution

27:47.625 --> 27:49.292
brought before the Centaurum.

27:49.375 --> 27:50.750
You must be mistaken.

27:50.833 --> 27:52.417
Knowledge..

27:52.500 --> 27:55.125
...is a basic tool of politics.

27:56.167 --> 27:58.708
Mine is considerable.

28:01.833 --> 28:04.875
But I never dreamed

28:04.958 --> 28:07.417
you would be a part
of his schemes.

28:08.792 --> 28:10.583
Why, Londo?

28:10.667 --> 28:13.375
I have a destiny to fulfill.

28:13.458 --> 28:14.750
One which would
take our people

28:14.833 --> 28:17.292
back to a golden age.

28:17.375 --> 28:20.250
We are Centauri, Urza.

28:20.333 --> 28:25.750
We are meant to conquer,
to rule, to build empires.

28:25.833 --> 28:29.083
You, the hero of Gorash,
should know that.

28:29.167 --> 28:32.458
I am an old hero.

28:32.542 --> 28:35.958
And what I saw
and did at Gorash

28:36.042 --> 28:39.667
still haunts me
in the night.

28:39.750 --> 28:44.208
I do not want to return
to that kind of glory, Londo.

28:44.292 --> 28:46.375
You listen to me, Urza.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.292
No one can stop this.

28:49.375 --> 28:53.250
A new day is coming
to our people, a great day.

28:54.875 --> 28:56.875
And I can help you
be a part of it.

28:56.958 --> 29:00.167
You cannot build an empire

29:00.250 --> 29:02.500
based on slaughter

29:02.583 --> 29:04.458
and deceit.

29:06.042 --> 29:08.792
Turhan knew that.

29:08.875 --> 29:10.792
I thought you did, too.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.667
Perhaps it is best
that I go.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.458
No, you cannot go yet.

29:15.083 --> 29:16.583
[snaps fingers]

29:16.667 --> 29:18.833
I have a gift for you.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.833
A coutari.

29:30.208 --> 29:32.375
And a finer blade
I have never seen.

29:32.458 --> 29:36.333
It is the blade
I carried at Gorash.

29:36.417 --> 29:39.625
I meant it as a symbol
of our alliance.

29:40.500 --> 29:43.000
Oh, it is magnificent.

29:44.125 --> 29:45.917
But I cannot accept it.

29:48.167 --> 29:50.917
Then accept this, Paso Leati.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.917
[dramatic music]

29:54.292 --> 29:56.625
By the laws
of the Couro Prido

29:56.708 --> 30:01.500
I challenge you
to the Morago, Londo Mollari.

30:01.583 --> 30:03.708
You would fight me
to the death, Urza?

30:03.792 --> 30:06.583
Yes, to save my honor

30:06.667 --> 30:10.208
and my family
from your new friends.

30:10.292 --> 30:12.792
Or have you become
as cowardly as they?

30:15.417 --> 30:19.042
I take your gift
and your challenge

30:19.125 --> 30:20.958
in the spirit in which
they are offered.

30:21.042 --> 30:22.542
Go.

30:22.625 --> 30:24.750
Make your peace
with the Gods

30:24.833 --> 30:27.250
and return here
in two hours.

30:28.042 --> 30:30.583
[dramatic music]

30:41.167 --> 30:43.583
(John)
Freeze frame.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.917
Well, I'll be..

30:47.083 --> 30:48.750
[groaning]

30:53.167 --> 30:55.458
[high-pitched buzzing]

30:57.667 --> 31:00.667
What do you want?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.292
[groans]

31:11.000 --> 31:12.500
Mom.

31:12.583 --> 31:13.625
Dad.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.125
Yes.

31:26.083 --> 31:27.042
[beeps]

31:27.125 --> 31:28.750
(Stephen)
'Franklin to Sheridan.'

31:28.833 --> 31:29.750
[beeps]

31:29.833 --> 31:32.083
'Franklin to Sheridan.'

31:32.167 --> 31:33.000
[beeps]

31:33.083 --> 31:34.542
'Franklin to Sheridan.'

31:34.625 --> 31:35.792
What were you thinking?

31:35.875 --> 31:37.500
You can't fight a duel
to the death.

31:37.583 --> 31:41.583
I must. Urza and I are
Couro Prido, proud knives.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.833
It would bring disgrace
on our house

31:43.917 --> 31:45.542
if I were to decline
his challenge.

31:45.625 --> 31:48.292
Those noble friends
of his would see to that.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.375
Disgrace is preferable
to death.

31:50.458 --> 31:52.208
There was a time
when I would agree with you.

31:52.292 --> 31:54.042
That time has passed.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.667
Londo, this is insane.

31:55.750 --> 31:58.917
Insanity is part
of the times!

31:59.042 --> 32:01.042
You must learn
to embrace the madness.

32:01.125 --> 32:02.958
Let it fire you.

32:06.667 --> 32:08.208
- Garibaldi.
- 'This is Dr. Franklin.'

32:08.292 --> 32:09.333
'Do you know
where the captain is?'

32:09.417 --> 32:10.500
What's wrong, doc?

32:10.583 --> 32:11.667
'Well, his med-bracelet
monitored'

32:11.750 --> 32:13.000
'a strange neural surge'

32:13.083 --> 32:14.042
'and then went dead.'

32:14.125 --> 32:15.333
'He's not answering his link.'

32:15.417 --> 32:17.125
I'm on it.
Garibaldi to all officers.

32:17.208 --> 32:18.750
I want the location
on Captain Sheridan.

32:18.833 --> 32:22.042
Commander, my board shows
Delta-1 prepping for launch.

32:23.833 --> 32:26.667
Delta-1, why are you
prepping for launch?

32:26.750 --> 32:29.708
Delta-1, please respond.
This is Commander Ivanova.

32:29.792 --> 32:31.833
(John)
'Ivanova, this is Sheridan.'

32:31.917 --> 32:33.375
Captain?
What are you doing?

32:33.458 --> 32:34.625
Just going out
for a little spin.

32:34.708 --> 32:36.167
There is no need to worry.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.875
I'll be back
before you know it.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.167
I hope.

32:40.250 --> 32:44.875
Authorization code,
Gamma 6-6-Z-niner.

32:44.958 --> 32:46.750
Override locking controls.

32:46.833 --> 32:48.167
[beeping]

32:48.250 --> 32:49.542
Open bay doors.

32:54.417 --> 32:55.833
Delta-1 is launching.

32:59.458 --> 33:00.583
Ivanova to Garibaldi.

33:00.667 --> 33:03.750
[instrumental music]

33:20.375 --> 33:22.042
Londo..

33:22.125 --> 33:24.375
I knew you would
not disappoint me.

33:24.458 --> 33:27.417
Do you really intend
to go through with this, Urza?

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
It is the only way.

33:29.583 --> 33:31.875
I do not want to kill you.

33:31.958 --> 33:35.583
In all our duels together,
you never could match me

33:35.667 --> 33:37.000
with a coutari.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.417
In all our duels together

33:38.500 --> 33:40.958
my life was never in jeopardy.

33:41.042 --> 33:43.542
You'll find I set
great store by it.

33:54.875 --> 33:56.083
(Michael on radio)
'Delta-2 to Delta-1.'

33:56.167 --> 33:58.875
'Do you read me?'

33:58.958 --> 34:01.083
- Garibaldi, is that you?
- It's one and the same.

34:01.167 --> 34:03.167
Mind telling me
what you're doing?

34:03.250 --> 34:04.792
I'm giving someone a lift.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.042
I think.

34:06.125 --> 34:07.708
Wanna explain that, sir?

34:07.792 --> 34:09.458
'Haven't quite got it all
figured out myself..'

34:09.542 --> 34:11.083
But I think you were right.

34:12.542 --> 34:14.625
The answer's in Sector 14.

34:14.708 --> 34:16.083
Sector 14?
But that's..

34:16.167 --> 34:18.583
(Michael on radio)
'Yeah, I know.'

34:18.667 --> 34:20.042
Lucky me.

34:25.292 --> 34:28.917
The Morago is declared
and accepted.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.125
Draw your swords with purpose..

34:31.208 --> 34:33.125
...and sheathe them with honor.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.250
[intense music]

35:00.333 --> 35:01.333
Oh, Skal Tura.

35:01.417 --> 35:02.500
[swords clanking]

35:06.750 --> 35:08.833
[grunting]

35:16.417 --> 35:18.500

35:21.292 --> 35:22.583

[screams]

35:45.875 --> 35:48.208
[beeping]

35:48.292 --> 35:49.917
Yeah, this is the place.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.375
Computer, scan for any
unusual phenomena.

[screaming]

36:32.375 --> 36:34.792
[dramatic music]

36:40.583 --> 36:42.250
Holy jumpin'!

36:49.000 --> 36:50.042
Captain.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.292
Do you read me?

36:52.875 --> 36:55.875
(Michael on radio)
'Captain Sheridan,
do you read me?'

36:55.958 --> 36:57.375
'Captain!'

37:01.542 --> 37:03.875
Computer, lock on to Delta-1.
Prepare to grapple.

'Signal unstable.'

37:10.667 --> 37:12.042
Damn it.

37:12.125 --> 37:13.833
Remind me to leave you
home next time.

37:15.083 --> 37:17.667
Alright.
We can do this ourselves.

37:22.208 --> 37:23.917
Alright. Come on.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.792
Come on.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.667
Come on.

37:27.750 --> 37:29.417
Nice and easy.

37:30.375 --> 37:31.583
That's it, Yeah!

37:31.667 --> 37:32.625
Alright!

37:32.708 --> 37:36.333
Reverse thrusters.
Full power.

37:36.417 --> 37:37.625
Get us out of here.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.000
(Michael on radio)
'Babylon 5, it's Garibaldi..'

38:00.083 --> 38:02.125
'Bringing our wandering
captain home.'

38:11.333 --> 38:14.417
Age has not dimmed
your skill, Paso Leati.

38:15.958 --> 38:18.708
Nor yours, Skal Tura.

38:18.792 --> 38:20.542
Let us end it then.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.375
[screams]

38:27.958 --> 38:29.417
[grunting]

38:32.042 --> 38:33.792
Londo!

38:36.000 --> 38:37.667
[panting]

38:40.083 --> 38:42.917
[groaning]

38:50.792 --> 38:52.458
The first stroke..

38:52.542 --> 38:54.792
...Paso Leati.

38:54.875 --> 38:57.542
Why did you make me
do this, Urza?

38:57.625 --> 39:03.125
My family, I could not
let them share my disgrace.

39:03.208 --> 39:06.375
But this way,
I die with honor.

39:06.458 --> 39:10.333
And you will see
they are protected.

39:10.417 --> 39:13.250
Yes, yes.
I promise it.

39:14.375 --> 39:18.625
I will guard them
as if they were my own.

39:20.375 --> 39:22.333
Thank you..

39:23.250 --> 39:25.083
...old friend.

39:26.458 --> 39:28.667
I will miss you.

39:47.583 --> 39:49.000
It was a life form.

39:49.083 --> 39:52.042
Sentient,
but completely alien.

39:52.125 --> 39:54.125
But what was it doing
in your head?

39:54.208 --> 39:56.208
It was trying to survive
and go home.

39:58.042 --> 40:00.708
Oh, he must've come through
that rift in Sector 14

40:00.792 --> 40:04.083
and somehow wound up
in that Markab's body.

40:04.167 --> 40:05.458
It drove him mad.

40:05.542 --> 40:07.417
How did you figure out
what it wanted from you?

40:07.500 --> 40:08.625
The images I got.

40:08.708 --> 40:12.458
Fear, loss, home.

40:12.542 --> 40:14.125
Somehow it was
sending me a message

40:14.208 --> 40:19.292
and touching deep emotions in me
which mirrored its own state.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.167
I was actually seeing
what it felt.

40:22.250 --> 40:24.042
(Stephen)
This is fantastic.

40:24.125 --> 40:25.833
For this creature
not to show up on my scans

40:25.917 --> 40:27.500
it would have to be
completely different

40:27.583 --> 40:29.875
from every alien species
we know.

40:29.958 --> 40:33.917
Possibly gaseous in nature
or-or maybe even pure energy.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.750
And yet, somehow it made
an empathic connection with you.

40:36.833 --> 40:39.667
- I think he's excited.
- Excited?

40:39.750 --> 40:43.125
We could be discovering
a whole new lifeform here.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.667
Since you helped it,
you think we might be able

40:44.750 --> 40:45.708
'to contact it again?'

40:45.792 --> 40:46.917
Uh, no, thanks.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.417
I prefer to be only
slightly insane.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.708
Yeah. Don't we all?

41:05.583 --> 41:09.125
I've made the arrangements
you requested for Urza's family.

41:11.875 --> 41:12.917
Londo?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.833
That's very good, Vir.
Thank you.

41:18.625 --> 41:19.750
Londo..

41:21.042 --> 41:22.750
...you had no choice.

41:22.833 --> 41:24.042
He would've killed you.

41:24.125 --> 41:26.875
He could've killed me anytime.

41:26.958 --> 41:29.667
He was right, you know.

41:29.750 --> 41:32.875
I never could best him
with a coutari.

41:32.958 --> 41:36.917
But my death would not
have saved his family.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.042
I don't understand.

41:39.125 --> 41:41.583
By the laws of the Morago

41:41.667 --> 41:45.000
the victor must accept
the loser's family

41:45.083 --> 41:46.667
as part of his own.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.042
They're House Mollari now.

41:51.292 --> 41:53.583
They cannot be harmed
by the resolution

41:53.667 --> 41:55.542
passed against Urza.

41:57.833 --> 41:59.667
He sacrificed himself.

42:02.542 --> 42:04.250
[sighing]

42:06.417 --> 42:09.708
I have made many choices
lately, Vir.

42:09.792 --> 42:12.417
And today,
for the first time..

42:13.667 --> 42:16.667
...I'm not sure
those choices were right.

42:16.750 --> 42:19.375
Perhaps some good has come
out of this tragedy.

42:19.458 --> 42:22.500
It's not too late
to make some new choices.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.250
No.

42:24.333 --> 42:26.458
The blood is already
on my hands.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.458
Right or wrong..

42:30.542 --> 42:33.208
...I must follow the path..

42:33.292 --> 42:35.083
...to its end.

42:35.167 --> 42:37.417
- But Londo--
- 'You can go now, Vir.'

42:37.500 --> 42:40.167
I want to sleep..

42:45.458 --> 42:47.208
...if I can.

42:52.083 --> 42:54.458

43:05.833 --> 43:08.250
