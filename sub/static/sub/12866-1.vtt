WALTER: (AS BEAVER)
This is a picture of Walter Black,

01:36.680 --> 01:39.390
a hopelessly depressed individual.

01:41.185 --> 01:44.854
Somewhere inside him is a man
who fell in love,

01:46.064 --> 01:47.148
who started a family...

01:47.733 --> 01:49.567
And then I woke up.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.028
...who ran a successful company.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.658
That man has gone missing.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.452
No matter what he's tried,

02:02.372 --> 02:03.706
and he's tried everything,

02:05.375 --> 02:06.667
Walter can't seem to bring him back.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.880
It's as if he's died

02:10.964 --> 02:13.716
but hasn't had the good sense
to take his body with him.

02:14.885 --> 02:18.387
So, mostly, what he does is sleep.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.564
Shares in his father's
once-proud toy company

02:28.649 --> 02:31.400
are now almost as worthless as Walter feels.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.447
His family used to resemble something
out of a holiday greeting card

02:36.532 --> 02:39.659
but now seems to be in perpetual mourning.

02:40.786 --> 02:45.414
Henry, his youngest, has become
what his teachers call "solitary."

02:46.208 --> 02:47.875
He'd like to become invisible one day

02:47.960 --> 02:50.586
instead of merely unnoticed
by his own father.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.882
And, Porter, his eldest?

02:55.342 --> 02:58.719
Well, he's terrified of becoming
just like his father.

02:59.596 --> 03:03.724
His mission? To catalog
every dreaded similarity that links them.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.518
Every lip bite.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.729
Every neck crack.
Every involuntary behavior.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.940
He plans to erase them one by one.

03:13.151 --> 03:17.864
His wife, Meredith, has hidden herself
behind her engineering work

03:17.948 --> 03:21.868
and nighttime conference calls to Tokyo
and rollercoaster designs.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.912
Anything to drown out the reality
of an absent husband.

03:26.748 --> 03:31.335
Walter's depression is an ink
that stains everything it touches.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.423
A black hole that swallows all who get near.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.845
They've all been waiting for him to wake up,

03:42.514 --> 03:43.514
to snap out of it,

03:45.100 --> 03:46.601
but he hasn't.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.439
So, Meredith does the only thing left to do

03:52.774 --> 03:54.942
and says the only thing left to say.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.154
Goodbye.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.548
Jared, you're failing this class.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.260
Do you honestly think you can suddenly
hand in an "A" paper and get away with it?

04:21.345 --> 04:22.345
What about Hector?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.180
You got him an "A" in Family Development.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.434
Look, I've never written anything for Hector.
All right?

04:28.518 --> 04:31.228
If he told you differently, he's a liar.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.148
Hypothetically, had I written him something,

04:34.232 --> 04:36.442
we would have
raised his grades incrementally.

04:36.902 --> 04:40.780
And if that happened, then, yes,
he might have turned in an "A" paper.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.824
He might even be making a "B"
in a class that he used to be failing.

04:43.909 --> 04:47.828
So, if someone wanted me to do this,
and do it as them,

04:47.913 --> 04:49.830
in their voice and at their skill level,

04:50.958 --> 04:52.959
I would say that they could
either do it my way

04:53.043 --> 04:56.462
or take your chances buying
some piece of shit off the Internet.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.298

05:47.097 --> 05:49.348

05:53.311 --> 05:55.271
How was your day?

05:56.523 --> 05:57.982
Did you talk to anyone?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.860
I guess.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.820
A new person or an old person?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.488
New.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.741
Good. What did you talk about?

06:07.284 --> 06:08.951
He said I was a ball-licker.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.831
I told him I wasn't,
and he threw me in the dumpster.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
What?

06:17.586 --> 06:19.378
Did you tell your teacher?

06:19.463 --> 06:21.130
She got me out of the dumpster.

06:24.301 --> 06:28.846
Well, this must be
some kind of misunderstanding,

06:29.306 --> 06:32.850
and we just have to realign
or correct their...

06:33.477 --> 06:34.852
I'll talk to the teacher.

06:36.938 --> 06:37.980

06:39.983 --> 06:42.318
No. He's not gone, honey.

then he robs the present.

he may rob the future.

19:18.616 --> 19:22.786
Because it's one thing for your little
anorexia squad to get by on their looks.

19:22.912 --> 19:27.749
That's all they've got.
But for someone like you, it's just lazy.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.501
Hold on.

19:30.545 --> 19:31.545
Wait a minute.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.964
Does this look lazy to you?

19:35.341 --> 19:38.426
That is 428 pages of lazy.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.013
And if you don't want to take my money
because you're just dying to see me

19:42.098 --> 19:45.225
make an ass of myself, then that's fine.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.352
But don't you dare call me lazy.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.104
Douche.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.324
(MUFFLED SINGING)

20:01.951 --> 20:03.994
Thank you very much.
You want olives in your salad?

20:04.078 --> 20:06.204
- HENRY: Yeah.
- Here you go. Watch this.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.124
(GRUNTING)

20:09.959 --> 20:10.959
Would you like some more?

20:12.753 --> 20:15.797
- What the...
- There he is. Hello.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.301
My card.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.721
We was afraid we'd have
to start without you.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.307
(SIGHS)

20:26.017 --> 20:27.142
This is a joke, right?

20:27.852 --> 20:29.311
WALTER: No, son, it's a fresh start.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.396
Have you completely lost your mind?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.607
- I know it seems a bit...
- I'm not talking to you, nut job.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.108
I'm talking to Mom.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.737
It takes you years to get him out of here,

20:38.821 --> 20:42.782
and you let him come back the next night
with a talking hamster?

20:50.291 --> 20:53.084
JON STEWART: Failure on this scale
doesn't happen overnight.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.795
MEREDITH: Still I can't believe
that you guys made that.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.841
I mean, you never... I mean, Walter never...

21:02.595 --> 21:05.847
I'm sorry. I'm not quite sure
how I'm supposed to address you.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.141
Well, you're doing fine, love.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.478
Well, tools were always
on your Christmas list,

21:11.562 --> 21:14.773
but I had no idea that you knew
how to actually make anything.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.691
He's a beaver, Mom. That's what they do.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.234
WALTER: Yeah. Spot on, mate.

21:18.736 --> 21:22.489
But, you know, Walter
wasn't half-bad himself, at one time.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.491
Yeah? Who taught him?

21:24.575 --> 21:25.867
WALTER: I suppose he taught himself.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.120
He was about your age, yeah. Cub Scouts.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.581
He and his pop were supposed
to make a racecar for a contest.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.876
Except, his pop weren't around
so he had to do it himself.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.337
Where was his dad?

21:42.677 --> 21:45.553
He got very sad and he had an accident.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.931
You mean Grandpa Jerry
from the graveyard?

21:48.641 --> 21:52.978
Right-o. Anyway, Walter had Grandpa's
tools but no clue how to use them.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.523
So, what he ended up making was so awful

21:56.607 --> 21:59.985
that it looked like he'd screwed a set
of wheels onto a piece of dog crap.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.194
(HENRY CHUCKLING)

22:01.278 --> 22:03.113
And you know what the other kids called it?

22:03.823 --> 22:07.367
The Turd. That was generous, mate.

22:07.702 --> 22:11.579
One lady threw up all over herself
just 'cause it got close to her.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.833
But when it came to racing...

22:15.584 --> 22:16.584
What?

22:17.420 --> 22:19.212
The Turd could not be beat.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.631
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.341
- Dad?
- Yeah, mate?

22:24.385 --> 22:27.220
- Can we make a Turd?
- Yeah, any time, mate.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.973
You give the word, we'll make the Turd.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.766
Yeah.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.228
Good night, Beaver.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.605
Good night, mate.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.607
(KISSING)

22:44.947 --> 22:45.947
Good night.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.452
HENRY: Good night, Beaver.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.414
- Hello?
- Norah.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.832
Hey, it's Porter.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.545
Listen, what I said earlier...

23:00.629 --> 23:03.256
- So, are you going to help me or not?
- Yeah.

23:05.342 --> 23:11.806
But for this sort of thing, I'm going to have
to ask you for, like, $500?

23:12.641 --> 23:13.641
Done.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.811
Wow. Would you have gone $1,000?

23:17.438 --> 23:19.230
- Oh, yeah.
- How about a million?

23:19.315 --> 23:20.440
Can you come by tomorrow?

23:21.317 --> 23:24.152
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

23:25.529 --> 23:30.325
You know, I didn't... Look, I...
We're cool, right? I... I'm...

23:30.659 --> 23:32.535
You've never even said a word to me,
you know, and...

23:32.620 --> 23:33.953
- Porter?
- And it's not like we

23:34.038 --> 23:37.290
- know each other or anything... Yeah.
- Just come by tomorrow.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.043
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.130
WALTER: Good night! See you soon.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.380
(HUMMING)

24:48.737 --> 24:52.282
Trust me, mate. Today will set you free.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.938
What the hell is this?

25:24.023 --> 25:25.398
I have no idea.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.567
This is layoffs, isn't it? Goddamn China.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.277
WALTER: Nobody's getting laid off.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.280
Get rid of you lot?

25:32.615 --> 25:34.282
I'd have no one to boss around, yeah?

25:36.577 --> 25:38.286
- The boss woke up and brought a friend.
- (PEOPLE CHUCKLING)

25:38.954 --> 25:43.750
I think we should maintain some respect
until Mr. Black tells us...

25:44.126 --> 25:45.126
Good morning, all.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.005
I assume you all got the cards.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.425
If not, allow me to briefly explain.

25:53.427 --> 25:57.555
Walter Black ascended
to CEO of this company two years ago.

25:57.640 --> 26:03.144
Not through any particular skill or merit,
but because Walter was next in line

26:03.270 --> 26:07.815
rather than our infinitely more qualified VP
standing right here.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.400
Hello, love.

26:09.485 --> 26:13.696
It was a job Walter was, well,
ill-prepared to handle.

26:14.782 --> 26:16.157
Basically, well...

26:17.618 --> 26:19.160
Walter's been a loser.

26:20.204 --> 26:26.834
Which is why, as of now, he is resigning
and putting me in charge.

26:27.294 --> 26:31.297
So, before you decide to run me out on a rail
with all the flaming torches and pitchforks,

26:31.382 --> 26:37.512
hear me out, give me five minutes,
then you may tear me to shreds, if you like.

26:37.638 --> 26:42.350
First, I will be ceding control
of all individual projects

26:42.434 --> 26:43.935
back to the teams themselves.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.353
That means you will be free

26:45.437 --> 26:48.940
and entrusted to do the jobs
you was hired to do in the first place.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.024
Hello, Hank.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.778
Second, we will revamp, revitalize, re-launch

26:53.946 --> 26:57.448
at the International Game
and Toy Manufacturers Expo

26:57.533 --> 27:00.326
in six weeks' time.

27:00.744 --> 27:05.707
Now, I know there's a very high degree
of skepticism about my ability to lead.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.333
Isn't that right?

27:07.418 --> 27:10.795
I mean, middle-aged man
with his arm stuck up my bum. Right?

27:11.046 --> 27:15.174
Who wouldn't doubt me?
But I'll make you the following deal.

27:15.259 --> 27:19.887
You give me two weeks, just two,
and at the end of that time,

27:19.972 --> 27:23.182
anyone who wants to resign
will receive severance pay

27:23.267 --> 27:25.476
and a glowing letter of recommendation.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.730
- No questions asked, no exceptions.
- MAN: Excuse me?

27:28.897 --> 27:30.315
And who exactly are you supposed to be?

27:31.066 --> 27:33.985
Bollocks. Did I forget to introduce meself?

27:34.570 --> 27:37.447
You may simply call me the Beaver.

27:45.247 --> 27:46.331
Impressive.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.584
So, what do you need to know?

27:51.295 --> 27:54.964
Well, I guess the first thing is,
what do you want to say?

27:57.926 --> 27:59.802
Well, that's kind of the problem.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.348
I mean, I got good grades. Big deal.
What do I know?

28:03.432 --> 28:07.185
Okay. Well, how do you want people to feel
when you're done?

28:07.436 --> 28:13.066
I guess I just want them to feel not

28:14.068 --> 28:15.318
let down.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.444
"Not let down."

28:16.945 --> 28:18.279
That's powerful.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.033
"I'm excited, pumped. How are you doing?"

28:22.117 --> 28:24.118
"Me? I'm not let down."

28:24.203 --> 28:25.328
(LAUGHS)

28:25.412 --> 28:28.206
I told you that I suck. This is why I need you.

28:28.290 --> 28:31.793
Okay, well, you're a cheerleader,
notorious hothead.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.920
Could we talk about you getting expelled
from the eighth grade?

28:35.798 --> 28:37.256
How did you find out about that?

28:38.008 --> 28:40.134
No secrets on the Internet.

28:40.636 --> 28:41.636
What did you do?

28:41.720 --> 28:42.929
Did you steal some encyclopedias?

28:43.013 --> 28:45.056
- Chew some nicotine gum?
- No.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.016
What? Tease a fat kid?

28:47.559 --> 28:48.559
Shut up.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.144
All right. So, what is it?

28:52.773 --> 28:54.065
I was tagging.

28:56.777 --> 28:57.985
Tagging?

28:59.655 --> 29:00.822
Like...

29:04.535 --> 29:05.535
Like graffiti tagging?

29:06.078 --> 29:10.123
More like art. It was just illegal.

29:12.042 --> 29:15.503
Where's all this rebel-artist shit now?

29:16.046 --> 29:18.047
That was a long time ago.

29:18.924 --> 29:22.385
You still have some, don't you? Yeah.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.679
- Show me, please.
- No.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.808
If you show me, I will write you a speech
that you could free Tibet with.

29:29.143 --> 29:30.226
Why do you want to see it so bad?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.187
Because I like to be surprised.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.361
- We have to be quick.
- All right.

29:42.239 --> 29:43.990
Whose room is this?

29:44.283 --> 29:45.575
NORAH: No one's.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.127
Oh, wow.

30:06.722 --> 30:11.851
I like to do it big.
Like freeways, buildings, billboards.

30:13.145 --> 30:18.274
And fast.
Like I'm running a million miles an hour.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.652
No thinking, you know?

30:24.114 --> 30:25.364
Why did you stop?

30:29.119 --> 30:32.580
'Cause I got caught
and my mom couldn't take it.

30:33.457 --> 30:36.417
Anyway, I threw them all away.

30:36.502 --> 30:37.502
Someone must have liked them.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.797
Pulled them out of the trash, didn't they?

30:43.050 --> 30:45.176
- Who was it?
- NORAH'S MOM: What are you doing in here?

30:47.346 --> 30:50.264
I was just showing Porter around the house.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.352
He's on the math team with me.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.562
- Right.
- Time to go.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.527
Hey, I'm sorry about my mom.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.863
- She's just, you know...
- That's fine.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.245
You know, you are

31:14.373 --> 31:15.790
so much weirder...

31:19.253 --> 31:22.797
Not weird, I just mean, like,
different, I guess.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.801
You're a lot more different
than I thought you'd be.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.012
You know, for someone I'm paying
a lot of money to write a speech for me,

31:30.097 --> 31:31.597
you're not very articulate.

31:32.683 --> 31:33.808
I'm much better on paper.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.310
We'll see.

31:37.437 --> 31:41.315
Thank you for not laughing, I guess.

31:41.775 --> 31:42.775
I wouldn't do that.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.652
I wouldn't laugh.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.654
Good.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.700
Very, very good.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.664
(SWIM UNTIL YOU CAN'T SEE LAND
PLAYING)

32:05.716 --> 32:10.845
(SINGING) We salute at the threshold
of the North Sea in my mind

32:11.597 --> 32:14.849
And a nod to the boredom that drove me here

32:14.933 --> 32:19.020
To face the tide and swim

32:19.688 --> 32:23.733
I swim, oh, swim

32:24.026 --> 32:28.237
WALTER: (AS BEAVER) And, eventually,
what seems strange becomes common.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.491
What seemed impossible becomes real.

32:32.576 --> 32:37.830
(SINGING) Up to my knees now,
do I wait? Do I dive?

32:38.498 --> 32:43.461
The sea has seen my like before though
it's my first and perhaps last time

32:44.379 --> 32:49.759
Let's call me a Baptist,
call this the drowning of the past

32:50.218 --> 32:55.389
She's there on the shoreline
Throwing stones at my back

32:55.474 --> 32:58.851
So swim until you can't see land

32:58.935 --> 33:04.899
Swim until you can't see land

33:04.983 --> 33:08.736
Are you a man or are you a bag of sand?

33:11.323 --> 33:15.242
WALTER: (AS BEAVER) Until things almost
start to feel the way they used to.

33:18.622 --> 33:19.830
Fixed it, love. Working like a charm.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.083
It's like it's all brand new.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.508
(HAMMERING)

33:30.592 --> 33:34.136
- Walter. Walter, wake up. Wake up.
- Mmm. What?

33:34.346 --> 33:37.932
It's Henry. He snuck out of his room.
He's down in the garage again by himself.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.226
Well, tell him to come to bed.

33:40.310 --> 33:45.147
I know. I tell him every night, but he needs
to hear it from, you know, you.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.108
Yeah.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.528
I'm on it.

33:54.324 --> 33:57.535
Whoa, where are you going
this time of night?

33:57.619 --> 33:59.787
I'm gonna tell the little guy
to knock it off so I can sleep.

33:59.871 --> 34:00.871
Right.

34:00.956 --> 34:04.333
I was going to the same place.
Come on. Let's triple-team him.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.462
That's okay.
You've got your little furry friend.

34:11.632 --> 34:12.632
Good night.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.768
What are you making besides a racket?

34:23.853 --> 34:24.853
You couldn't sleep, either?

34:25.772 --> 34:28.983
Well, actually, mate,
I was having a brilliant kip

34:29.067 --> 34:31.277
till you started banging away.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.946
I just had this idea.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.489
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's have the idea in the morning.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.618
Just 10 more minutes, please?

34:39.703 --> 34:41.328
Ten more minutes, all right, yes.

34:41.413 --> 34:45.833
But no more mucking about with tools
when I'm not around. It's not safe.

34:46.001 --> 34:48.668
Or when your mother's asked you not to.
Or at night.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.630
Or in a toilet.
Or when you're climbing Mount Everest.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.675
Or picking your nose. Agreed?

34:55.302 --> 34:57.178
- Agreed.
- There you go.

34:59.890 --> 35:03.058
Can you talk to me? I like it when you talk.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.561
What do you want me to talk about?

35:05.645 --> 35:07.104
Doesn't matter. Just talk.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.566
You have a funny voice.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.861
You're quite easily entertained, aren't you?

35:17.532 --> 35:22.036
Give you a buzz saw, a block of wood,
and some chatter...

35:29.044 --> 35:30.586
(WALTER HUMMING)

35:31.046 --> 35:32.546
MEREDITH: Hey, Walter, did you talk to him?

35:32.881 --> 35:35.841
Yes, and everything's fine.
He'll stick to the schedule.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.218
What's going on?

35:37.385 --> 35:41.013
I've had a breakthrough, love.
Got to get to work right away.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.097
Now?

35:42.182 --> 35:43.724
Not a moment to spare!

35:47.062 --> 35:48.729
You're a goddess.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.410
Sir? You're in early.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.788
Just the woman I wanted to see.

36:06.873 --> 36:07.873
Have a look at this.

36:08.959 --> 36:11.752
Now, we need to get started on this
right away.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.754
It's a beaver?

36:14.798 --> 36:15.840
It's the future.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.299
This?

36:17.592 --> 36:19.760
WALTER: The Talking Beaver
Woodworking Set.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.888
You get your basic tools, a block of wood

36:22.973 --> 36:25.558
and a talking beaver
to work right alongside of you.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.309
You should see the kids, love.

36:27.394 --> 36:29.436
I mean, they've got their cell phones
and their computers,

36:29.521 --> 36:32.064
but, wow, you give them a block of wood,
a hammer and a saw?

36:32.148 --> 36:33.482
Bob's their bleeding auntie.

36:33.567 --> 36:36.068
Their poor little brains are starving
for something like this.

36:36.152 --> 36:39.530
So, you're talking about a new product line
for what? Christmas?

36:39.614 --> 36:42.616
Christmas? I'm talking about right now,
woman. Today.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.785
This morning.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.455
I guess there could be an ancillary market
in more tools.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.208
Maybe pre-cut lumber pieces?

36:51.293 --> 36:53.335
Sort of like Lego kits but made of wood.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.046
And you can work them
into shapes on your own.

36:56.298 --> 36:58.507
Now, that's using your scone.

36:58.842 --> 37:00.801
Not just made out of wood, is it? Let's go.

37:01.094 --> 37:02.386
But this would mean, I mean,

37:02.470 --> 37:06.307
even if we could get one ready in time,
this is all we would have for the Expo.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.309
That's all we'll need, my darling.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.613
WALTER: (AS BEAVER)
And for every person that points out

37:20.697 --> 37:22.531
that there's a rodent at the helm,

37:22.616 --> 37:28.162
there's another to remind him or her that
production has already increased by 35%.

37:28.538 --> 37:32.333
At the end of those first two weeks,
not one person resigns.

37:32.834 --> 37:33.834
Not one.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.504
WALTER: Now, we're going to start with...

37:38.715 --> 37:42.968
The Beaver, as a core item,
along with endless project kits

37:43.428 --> 37:45.304
could produce an exponential return.

37:45.722 --> 37:50.100
The question is, do we want
to continue struggling merely to survive,

37:50.185 --> 37:55.064
or do we want to embrace something new,
something different,

37:55.190 --> 37:57.232
and see where it takes us?

38:00.654 --> 38:03.781
WALTER: (AS BEAVER) Once again,
our beloved Jerry Co.

38:03.865 --> 38:08.035
Has vision, power, energy, balls.

38:10.789 --> 38:14.333
Item number three this morning,
we've got some fabrication concerns.

38:14.542 --> 38:15.918
Why are you all laughing?

38:48.410 --> 38:49.994
(PANTING)

38:56.668 --> 38:59.086
Did you talk to Dr. Macy today?

39:00.755 --> 39:05.426
Indeed. He says we're coming along
just brilliantly.

39:08.763 --> 39:12.391
Well, did he give you some kind of a timeline
for when the treatment might be over?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.935
No, nothing specific, love.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.146
Like a week, or a month, or...

39:18.189 --> 39:19.440
It's a process, love.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.276
We'll know when the time is right.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.948
Now, rest up, you delicious little tart.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.451
There's more where that came from.

40:04.569 --> 40:08.322
Hector, what do I always say, man?
Read it before you turn it in.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.990
It was about your own family,
for Christ's sake.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.951
I just figured since it was personal,
there wouldn't be no test questions on it.

40:13.036 --> 40:16.205
- But your own grandma turned you in.
- Yes. She was so proud.

40:16.289 --> 40:20.250
Talking about the stuff that you had wrote
about her back in the day in D.R.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.920
And then all of a sudden,
she could just tell I knew nothing about it.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.172
So, she starts crying.
She calls the principal, says she doesn't...

40:25.256 --> 40:27.257
All right. My name stays out of this.
You understand that, right?

40:27.342 --> 40:31.095
- She called me a liar and a cheater.
- All right, all right, all right. Look.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.599
Okay, I'm gonna make
a dummy website, all right?

40:35.683 --> 40:37.768
You tell them you sent in your money,
you got your paper.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.895
That's all you know, okay?

40:41.981 --> 40:43.065
Hector, look, I gotta go.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.608
I'm gonna give you the website tomorrow,
all right?

40:45.193 --> 40:47.319
- Hector!
- Yes, yes, yes.

40:47.403 --> 40:48.737
Great. Good.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.489
Norah!

40:51.199 --> 40:52.241
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:53.868 --> 40:56.620
- Why are you all sweaty?
- I was doing yoga.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.040
- Manly.
- Downward Dog's a bitch.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.920
- Are you busy tonight?
- Are you asking me out?

41:05.255 --> 41:06.255
No. Not at all.

41:06.339 --> 41:09.550
I was just gonna casually inquire
if you're busy

41:09.634 --> 41:12.803
without making it seem like I'd been
up all night planning something elaborate.

41:12.887 --> 41:15.681
Have you been up all night
planning something elaborate?

41:16.516 --> 41:18.100
Yeah, I have, like, maps and stuff.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.184
(LAUGHS)

41:20.395 --> 41:23.647
You can pick me up at 7:00.
I have to be back at 12:00.

41:24.649 --> 41:28.443
Awesome, so it's a date. I mean, it is, right?

41:29.404 --> 41:30.737
We'll see.

41:33.908 --> 41:34.908
Cool.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.079
Don't mess this up.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.775
You let me lead, all right?

42:09.611 --> 42:12.154
Are you almost ready? Reservation's at 8:00.

42:13.448 --> 42:18.243
- Bloody hell, woman. Look at you.
- Well, you're looking pretty good yourself.

42:18.328 --> 42:20.537
- Yeah, well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
- Yeah?

42:20.622 --> 42:23.165
The girls whipped up
something special for me.

42:26.169 --> 42:28.462
We're talking full-on tux, love.

42:30.256 --> 42:33.133
Yeah. Just give us a minute to pop it on,
and we'll be off.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.260
Wait, it's our anniversary, honey.

42:35.845 --> 42:36.887
That's why I went for the penguin suit.

42:36.971 --> 42:39.806
I do not want to celebrate
20 years of marriage with a puppet.

42:41.976 --> 42:45.979
I'm sorry. I've been very patient
and I've been very supportive,

42:47.106 --> 42:49.733
but I want you, not him.

42:52.028 --> 42:54.488
Not tonight.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.165
Hi.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.085
Black, party of two.

43:20.848 --> 43:23.725
So, when do I get
to see some of your pages?

43:24.769 --> 43:26.311
Never. It's a pyramid scheme.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.647
- I didn't tell you that?
- No.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.066
You didn't get the brochure?

43:31.150 --> 43:33.944
- I'm kidding. I'll get it done.
- You better.

43:34.028 --> 43:38.240
I'm not giving you 500 bucks just so you can
buy a flat screen for your dorm room.

43:38.324 --> 43:41.034
I'm not buying a flat screen
for my dorm room.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.160
Then, what?

43:43.204 --> 43:44.871
- A mummy.
- No mummy.

43:46.124 --> 43:49.042
- Then, what? What's it going to?
- Nothing.

43:49.794 --> 43:51.128
Mmm-mmm.

43:51.212 --> 43:54.256
A guy like you
doesn't do anything for no reason.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.008
You've got a plan.

44:03.057 --> 44:07.978
I was listening to the radio and, apparently,
it's gonna be really hot this weekend.

44:08.938 --> 44:13.233
Not hot-hot, just above average.

44:17.363 --> 44:20.574
- So, how's work?
- Good. Yeah, busy.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.076
Busy?

44:27.290 --> 44:29.750
NORAH: Maps? That's what
you're saving all your money for?

44:30.293 --> 44:31.335
Yeah.

44:31.419 --> 44:34.588
Okay, explain, because right now,
it's looking like where you hide your bodies.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.759
- It is. Every red dot is a dead body.
- (LAUGHING)

44:39.093 --> 44:40.135
Just trying to be honest.

44:40.219 --> 44:42.387
Okay, really, what's it for?

44:44.932 --> 44:49.353
It's, like, all these places where
everything changed in the blink of an eye.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.522
Like the balcony
where Martin Luther King got shot.

44:52.607 --> 44:55.650
The train tracks where Woody Guthrie
hopped on his first train.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.194
And?

45:00.615 --> 45:04.826
And I just visit them and then I end up
at Brown the day before school starts.

45:05.703 --> 45:08.163
It's kind of like a find-yourself trip?

45:08.664 --> 45:13.043
No. More like a lose-stuff trip.

45:14.629 --> 45:17.339
What kind of stuff do you want to lose?

45:18.257 --> 45:20.592
At last count, 49 things.

45:24.597 --> 45:28.809
An elaborate, mysterious plan,
and a little weird.

45:31.312 --> 45:32.312
But I like it.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.816
It's your paper-writing dollars at work.

45:44.492 --> 45:45.492
What was that for?

45:45.952 --> 45:47.869
You said you liked to be surprised.

45:50.498 --> 45:52.582
- Ready?
- For what?

46:06.597 --> 46:08.306
It's a great place.

46:09.350 --> 46:11.893
It's kind of scary but beautiful.

46:14.355 --> 46:18.275
Look, I wasn't sure which color you liked,
so I kind of got everything.

46:18.359 --> 46:20.444
I hope you like sunburst yellow.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.864
Porter? Porter, come on.
What are you doing?

46:24.198 --> 46:25.866
Is this fantastic, or what?

46:25.950 --> 46:28.702
Are you kidding?
It's awesome, but I'm not going to touch it.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.163
- Why not?
- Because.

46:32.957 --> 46:36.418
- Because, what? Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

46:38.087 --> 46:40.589
Come on, Norah.
You have this amazing thing that you do.

46:41.507 --> 46:45.594
You just put all of yourself out there.
All I can do is sound like other people.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.346
- I know you have something to say.
- Okay.

46:48.681 --> 46:52.058
- Knock yourself out. You do it.
- Come on.

46:53.269 --> 46:54.978
No. I don't paint.

46:55.688 --> 46:58.607
Why not?
You're so good at being other people.

46:58.691 --> 47:02.736
- Well, maybe if I could paint I would, but...
- Porter, just start.

47:04.197 --> 47:05.280
Okay.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.703
What are you going to do?
Write "Norah + Porter forever"?

47:13.581 --> 47:15.624
Because that'd be pretty cute.

47:45.988 --> 47:47.197
Right?

47:51.619 --> 47:54.538
- That's what you've been wanting to say.
- No.

47:54.622 --> 47:57.707
You wrote 400 pages of notes.
Not one word about him?

47:57.792 --> 48:00.210
What happened to my brother
is none of your business.

48:00.294 --> 48:01.336
Do you understand?

48:01.420 --> 48:03.213
I just thought there was something
you wanted to say

48:03.297 --> 48:05.298
and you didn't know how.

48:06.259 --> 48:07.551
It's none of your business.

48:08.511 --> 48:10.637
What kind of person
does something like this?

48:11.222 --> 48:12.931
What's the matter with you?

48:17.311 --> 48:18.520
(SIREN WAILS)

48:28.698 --> 48:30.115
Go on. Open it.

48:31.534 --> 48:34.494
Henry helped me, which basically means

48:34.579 --> 48:37.789
that I bought the wood
and he did all the work.

48:43.671 --> 48:45.380
It's a memory box.

48:46.591 --> 48:48.300
It's very nice. Thank you.

48:48.926 --> 48:50.343
Look inside.

48:55.850 --> 48:59.352
I thought it was important
to remind ourselves of how things were.

48:59.520 --> 49:02.188
How things should be.

49:05.526 --> 49:07.402
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

49:13.743 --> 49:17.037
Walter. No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

49:17.705 --> 49:19.539
(PANTING)

49:20.875 --> 49:22.459
Is this what you want?

49:23.294 --> 49:25.629
Is this progress? Christ, woman!

49:26.797 --> 49:29.507
He's suffering from depression,
not amnesia!

49:29.592 --> 49:31.676
You think the problem
is he can't remember these things?

49:32.178 --> 49:34.971
- No.
- He can't go back. Don't you see that?

49:35.890 --> 49:40.185
This is all in the past, and dredging it up...
Do you know where this leads?

49:40.853 --> 49:43.146
You know where this Walter goes?

49:43.230 --> 49:47.817
To a 10th floor balcony,
tied to a shower curtain rod.

49:47.902 --> 49:49.778
Is that what you want?

49:50.738 --> 49:53.823
You want the rest of your life
to be just like tonight?

49:53.908 --> 49:57.535
- Well, that was Walter.
- No, Walter. No, come on.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.873
Look at this. You really look at this.

50:03.751 --> 50:05.335
That's you, Walter.

50:06.545 --> 50:08.046
Remember that?

50:09.006 --> 50:13.968
When Porter was born, and he was so little?

50:14.595 --> 50:18.181
And they pulled him out of me,
and you stood right by him.

50:18.265 --> 50:19.349
You looked him right in the eye,

50:19.433 --> 50:21.101
and you let him know
that you weren't going anywhere,

50:21.185 --> 50:24.062
that you were staying right there
so he wouldn't be scared.

50:25.606 --> 50:28.608
Walter, that's you. That's the man I love.
That's the man I need.

50:30.778 --> 50:32.237
You're still inside there, honey.

50:33.948 --> 50:38.159
I know you're in there. We can go back.

50:38.244 --> 50:40.036
We can get back to the way
that we used to be.

50:40.121 --> 50:42.831
We are not going
down that street again, Meredith.

50:43.958 --> 50:48.211
This man is a dead end.
He's gone. He has to be.

50:49.088 --> 50:50.130
You get it?

50:51.257 --> 50:52.257
I fought for you.

50:53.008 --> 50:56.052
I practically breathed for you for two years
when you couldn't even get out of bed,

50:56.137 --> 50:59.222
and I will continue to fight for you
because I love you.

51:00.141 --> 51:03.268
I've got to know that you're coming back.
Come back to me, please.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.231
Walter?

51:21.746 --> 51:24.539
Norah, I can't take this again.

51:28.169 --> 51:29.419
Come on.

51:37.553 --> 51:40.054
Hello. We came as soon as we heard.

51:41.348 --> 51:44.726
I'm the Beaver,
and this is Porter's dad, Walter.

51:46.812 --> 51:49.564
Listen, we'll get it all sorted.
I'm here now so we'll take care of things.

51:49.982 --> 51:52.192
Have a nice safe drive home.

52:08.667 --> 52:09.667
WALTER: Wait.

52:12.755 --> 52:16.049
Porter, mate, hang about. Come on.
We can discuss this. Come on.

52:16.133 --> 52:17.592
- Give me that thing!
- Calm down!

52:17.676 --> 52:19.969
- Give it to me! Goddamn it!
- Stop it!

52:20.054 --> 52:21.596
- Give me that thing!
- Stop!

52:24.892 --> 52:29.729
Porter! Porter! Oh, my God.
Porter, are you okay? Are you all right?

52:30.231 --> 52:31.689
Porter, let me see your hands.
Are they bleeding?

52:31.774 --> 52:34.359
I'm sorry, son. I didn't mean to do that.

52:34.443 --> 52:36.569
You keep your hands off him!

52:37.238 --> 52:38.530
Porter, come on. Let me see.

52:52.711 --> 52:54.003
MEREDITH: Are you happy now?

52:54.421 --> 52:55.839
Porter? Porter?

53:34.962 --> 53:37.130
It's Christmas in May.

53:37.214 --> 53:39.132
That's what some retailers are saying

53:39.216 --> 53:43.219

selling out in droves.

53:43.304 --> 53:46.389
Recently, Jerry Co.
Had been in steep decline,

53:46.473 --> 53:49.809
hovering on the verge of bankruptcy
earlier this year.

53:49.894 --> 53:53.938
But thanks to Mr. Beaver,
that won't be happening any time soon.

53:55.190 --> 53:59.027
It's like a $100 million ad campaign, for free!

54:00.404 --> 54:01.529
(SIGHS)

54:02.281 --> 54:06.659
Jerry Co.'s back in the game.
The old man would be so proud.

54:08.954 --> 54:10.204
I've got to hand it to you.

54:10.289 --> 54:13.458
You pulled all the strings,
and look where we landed.

54:13.542 --> 54:15.418
On top, for once.

54:19.882 --> 54:22.175
- It feels good, doesn't it?
- They.

54:26.263 --> 54:27.263
Sir?

54:28.849 --> 54:30.183
My family.

54:31.101 --> 54:33.686
Who's the biggest interview request
we've had so far?

54:36.565 --> 54:40.818
- All the morning shows. CNN, CNBC...
- Today Show, then. Set it up.

54:40.903 --> 54:44.656
But, sir, the Today Show is on television.

54:44.740 --> 54:51.120
What are we hiding? We're winners.
We should be shouting it from the rooftops.

54:52.081 --> 54:53.706
It would certainly be a story.

55:02.758 --> 55:07.637
I'm gonna tell you something
that I've never told anyone else,

55:09.848 --> 55:11.474
but I think you're ready to hear it.

55:13.519 --> 55:14.602
Okay.

55:17.731 --> 55:18.898
I'm not a puppet.

55:22.361 --> 55:23.611
I'm real.

55:25.823 --> 55:27.156
I'm alive.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.410
And the world needs to know.

(WALTER CLEARS THROAT)

55:52.224 --> 55:53.975
You all right, love?

55:57.312 --> 55:58.771
Some trouble?

55:59.565 --> 56:01.691
I talked to Dr. Macy today.

56:03.819 --> 56:06.362
What did he have to say for himself?

56:12.119 --> 56:14.871
He says that you haven't been to see him
in over a year.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.833
Dr. Macy says that you're sick, Walter.
Very sick.

56:18.917 --> 56:19.959
Yeah. Right.

56:20.044 --> 56:21.919
He said this sounds like
some kind of a mania.

56:22.004 --> 56:25.089
Okay, well, who gives a shit
what Dr. Macy has to say?

56:25.174 --> 56:26.174
I fixed him.

56:27.176 --> 56:31.971
Everybody else seems to get it.
Henry, people at work. Everyone except you.

56:33.182 --> 56:34.223
Does that tell you something?

56:34.308 --> 56:36.517
You just want to live like this forever?
Talking through your hand?

56:36.602 --> 56:39.479
I'd say it's been a pretty
smashing success so far, wouldn't you?

56:39.563 --> 56:42.940
You need help, Walter! You need help!
You're sick.

56:43.025 --> 56:47.320
"Help." Eat the pill, read the book,
see the bleeding expert.

56:48.322 --> 56:50.490
- Walter finally helped himself.
- Listen to yourself. This is insane.

56:50.574 --> 56:51.574
You're talking about a puppet.

56:51.658 --> 56:55.453
No, Meredith.
You're talking about a bloody puppet.

56:56.246 --> 56:58.498
We're talking about a miracle.

- Who's "we," Walter?

57:11.887 --> 57:14.305
I know it's hard, mate. I know.

57:16.183 --> 57:18.351
You can't afford to get mixed up
in all of this.

57:19.853 --> 57:23.481
You just keep moving.
Keep moving and don't look back.

57:39.915 --> 57:41.874
You're right, of course.

57:43.877 --> 57:45.670
Walter is sick.

57:48.882 --> 57:53.970
But make no mistake about it, love.
I'm not going anywhere.

58:02.855 --> 58:04.605
I've rented a house.

58:05.816 --> 58:08.192
I'm taking the boys
and everything we can carry.

58:08.277 --> 58:11.571
I don't want you to call.
I don't want you to visit.

58:13.824 --> 58:17.702
If you're determined to lose your mind,
well, I can't stop you.

58:18.537 --> 58:22.832
But I'm not gonna let them stand there
and watch it. Not my sons.

Insanity may play at the office,
but it's not gonna work in front of a judge.

But I want to stay with you.

- Let's go.

I love you, Daddy.

I love you, too, son. I love you, too.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:17.530
Go on. Off you go. Go on.

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:55.234
Well, sometimes, Matt... May I call you Matt?

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:56.319
MATT: Yeah, sure.

Sometimes, a single inspiration
just comes to you

in the middle of the night.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:09.165
But your genius seems to hide
in a stuffed toy.

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:13.002
So people have to doubt your sanity a little.

Great music, don't you think?

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.556
Walter, I want to talk about depression.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.975
Because the way it's been told to me,

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:31.145
this whole thing started as a way for you
to deal with your mental illness.

01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:33.814
Well, all right.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.107
Well, sometimes, Matt,

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:41.072
we reach a point where, in order to go on,

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:43.741
we have to wipe the slate clean.

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:47.787
We start to see ourselves as a box
that we're trapped inside.

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:50.456
And no matter how we try and escape,

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.042
self-help, therapy, drugs,

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:55.795
we just sink further and further down.

01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:58.881
The only way to truly break out of the box

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:01.050
is just to get rid of it altogether.

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:04.387
I mean, you built it in the first place.

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:08.099
If the people around you
are breaking your spirit, who needs them?

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:10.643
Your wife who pretends to love you,

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.561
your son who can't even stand you.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:15.106
I mean, put them out of their misery.

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:16.982
Starting over isn't crazy.

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:21.946
Crazy is being miserable

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:24.782
and walking around half asleep, numb,

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:27.576
day after day after day.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.745
Crazy is pretending to be happy.

01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:34.417
Pretending that the way things are

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:37.920
is the way they have to be
for the rest of your bleeding life.

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:41.340
All the potential, hope,

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.467
all that joy, feeling,

01:02:43.552 --> 01:02:46.929
all that passion
that life has sucked out of you.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.473
Reach out, grab a hold of it

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:53.519
and snatch it back
from that blood-sucking rabble.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:58.274
MATT: Walter, it's good to have you here.

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:00.651

There's a lot of people out there

Yeah, well, I called you, I texted you,
and I IM'd you,

and it never seems like a good time. So...

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:50.242
Maybe you should take that as a hint.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:53.913
I'm an idiot, all right?
That's not how I wanted things to turn out.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:56.499
I like you, all right? I actually give a shit.

It's just going to make you nothing.

Walter, not like this.

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:20.651
Don't do it.

01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:22.402
It will be worse than before. Much worse.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:26.448
Do you want to end up

and he did some research.

and you think you're a mess.

Today I'm here to warn you
that you are being lied to.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:40.024
Our parents, our teachers, our doctors
have lied to us.

01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:45.238
And it's the exact same lie.
The same six words,

01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:47.824
"Everything is going to be okay."

01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:51.619
But what if it isn't?

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:55.707
What if some of human experience
is just something you inherit,

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.585
like curly hair or blue eyes?

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:03.339
What if pain is just in your DNA
and tragedy is your birthright?

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:05.758
Or what if...

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:08.595

"...right out of the blue,

"shit just happens?

"Man, this is the darkest graduation speech
I've ever heard."

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:30.533
And it is.
I agree with you, but I didn't write it.

01:20:34.914 --> 01:20:40.001
I've spent so much time
waiting for this lie to come true

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:43.755
that I finally paid someone
to tell the truth for me.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.718
I'm not okay.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:50.720
Not at all.

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:55.350
The truth is,

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:57.727
I'm missing something,

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:00.939
the thing I loved the most,

01:21:02.233 --> 01:21:05.193
the face I wish
were in the front row right now.

01:21:07.571 --> 01:21:10.281
The brother I'll never get back.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:17.455
So what do I do with that?

01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:23.127
What do any of us do,

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:26.089
besides lie?

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:31.511
This is what I believe.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:39.852
Right now, in this auditorium,
there is someone who is with you.

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:44.274
Someone who is willing to pick you up,
dust you off,

01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:45.650
kiss you, forgive you,

01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:49.904
put up with you, wait for you, carry you,

01:21:50.281 --> 01:21:51.656

01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:56.828
So, while everything
may not always be okay,

01:21:57.788 --> 01:21:59.956
one thing I know is true.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:04.002
You do not have to be alone.

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.963
I didn't think you'd come.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:51.591
I didn't think I would, either.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.267
I'm just glad you're still here.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:05.021
Yeah, most of me, anyway.

01:23:05.606 --> 01:23:07.148
Yeah.

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:14.238
You know, when I was a little kid,

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.159
man, all I ever wanted was to be like you.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:22.705
Then I got older,

01:23:25.376 --> 01:23:28.127
and I just wanted to be anybody else.

01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:35.885
And now?

who had to become a father,

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:57.300
so that, one day,
this might just be a picture of Walter Black.
