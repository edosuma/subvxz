[ALBERT SOBS]

16:05.109 --> 16:09.671
- What is it?
- It's my fault. All my fault.

16:09.847 --> 16:14.147
- I've ruined everyone's Christmas.
- I know you wrote the letter, Albert.

16:14.318 --> 16:20.382
You told us so, and that was honest of you.
But as you said, it was your opinion.

16:20.558 --> 16:23.391
ALBERT:
No, that isn't it. <i>Something</i> else.

16:23.561 --> 16:26.997
FATHER MOUSE: What else?
- Mr. Trundle's clock...

16:27.164 --> 16:31.157
...in the <i>village</i> hall.
I wanted to see how it worked...

16:31.335 --> 16:33.200
...so I climbed up into it and...

16:33.671 --> 16:35.468
- Kerplunk.
- Kerplooey.

16:35.673 --> 16:38.574
- You broke the clock?
- I didn't mean it, Father.

16:38.743 --> 16:41.735
I'm sorry. So sorry.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.711
It's not enough. When you've done
<i>something</i> wrong...

16:44.882 --> 16:47.146
...you have to correct the <i>thing</i> you did.

16:47.952 --> 16:51.581
That's it. I'll fix it, Father.
I'll fix the clock by midnight.

16:51.756 --> 16:54.748
- Then maybe Santa will...
- You believe in Santa?

16:54.926 --> 16:59.886
I don't know. I don't know. But I've
learned that I still got a lot to learn.

17:00.064 --> 17:02.430
But, son, you don't know
how to fix a clock.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.330
That's all right, Father. Copernicus knew.

17:08.271 --> 17:10.604
[SINGING] <i>You hope</i>
<i>And I'll hurry</i>

17:10.775 --> 17:13.209
<i>You pray</i>
<i>And I'll plan</i>

17:13.377 --> 17:16.471
<i>We'll do what's necessary</i>
<i>'Cause</i>

17:16.646 --> 17:21.084
<i>Even a miracle</i>
<i>Needs a hand</i>

17:21.252 --> 17:22.776
Good luck.

[TICKING]

17:27.223 --> 17:28.486
Psst.

17:28.659 --> 17:32.095
- Father Mouse?
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Trundle.

17:32.863 --> 17:36.299
- Not very merry, I'm afraid.
- You're right, of course.

17:36.467 --> 17:39.095
And it's my fault, my family's.

17:39.270 --> 17:41.568
- How so?
- My older boy, Albert.

17:41.739 --> 17:44.936
First, he insulted Santa, and then...

17:45.810 --> 17:48.210
- I can hardly say it.
- Go on.

17:48.379 --> 17:52.315
I'm afraid he got into your clock
to see how it worked, and then...

17:52.583 --> 17:54.813
- Kerplunk.
- Kerplooey.

17:54.986 --> 17:57.614
So that was it.

17:57.788 --> 18:00.951
The boy has repented.
He's <i>trying</i> to make amends right now.

Three seconds to Christmas.

18:28.219 --> 18:29.516
No chimes.

18:29.687 --> 18:31.518
No <i>song.</i>

TRUNDLE: <i>When out on the lawn</i>
<i>There arose such a clatter</i>

20:27.938 --> 20:30.429
<i>I sprang from the bed</i>
<i>To see what was the matter</i>

20:30.608 --> 20:32.769
<i>Away to the window</i>
<i>I flew like a flash</i>

20:32.943 --> 20:35.912
<i>Tore open the shutters</i>
<i>And threw up the sash</i>

20:36.147 --> 20:38.479
<i>The moon on the breast</i>
<i>Of the new-fallen snow</i>

20:38.649 --> 20:41.880
<i>Gave the luster of midday</i>
<i>To objects below</i>

<i>When what to my wondering eyes</i>
<i>Should appear</i>

20:45.422 --> 20:49.290
<i>But a miniature sleigh</i>
<i>And eight tiny reindeer</i>

20:49.460 --> 20:52.054
<i>With a little old driver</i>
<i>So lively and quick</i>

20:52.229 --> 20:55.756
<i>I knew in a moment</i>
<i>It must be Saint Nick</i>

20:55.933 --> 20:58.663
<i>More rapid than eagles</i>
<i>His coursers they came</i>

20:58.836 --> 21:02.328
<i>And he whistled and shouted</i>
<i>And called them by name</i>

21:02.506 --> 21:06.101
SANTA: <i>Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer!</i>
<i>Now, Prancer and Vixen!</i>

<i>When they meet with an obstacle</i>

<i>With a sleigh full of toys</i>
<i>And Saint Nicholas too</i>

21:35.005 --> 21:38.236
<i>And then, in a twinkling</i>
<i>I heard on the roof</i>

21:38.409 --> 21:41.469
<i>The prancing and pawing</i>
<i>Of each little hoof</i>

21:41.979 --> 21:44.209
<i>As I drew in my head</i>
<i>And was turning around</i>

21:44.715 --> 21:47.843
<i>Down the chimney</i>
<i>Saint Nicholas came with a bound</i>

21:48.018 --> 21:50.714
<i>He was dressed all in fur</i>
<i>From his head to his foot</i>

21:51.222 --> 21:54.157
<i>And his clothes were all tarnished</i>
<i>With ashes and soot</i>

21:54.325 --> 21:56.452
<i>A bundle of toys</i>
<i>He had flung on his back</i>

21:56.627 --> 21:59.460
<i>And he looked like a peddler</i>
<i>Just opening his pack</i>

21:59.897 --> 22:04.163
<i>His eyes, how they twinkled</i>
<i>His dimples, how merry</i>

22:04.335 --> 22:08.396
<i>His cheeks were like roses</i>
<i>His nose like a cherry</i>

22:08.572 --> 22:11.541
<i>His droll little mouth</i>
<i>Was drawn up like a bow</i>

22:11.709 --> 22:14.906
<i>And the beard of his chin</i>
<i>Was as white as the snow</i>

22:15.079 --> 22:17.513
<i>The stump of a pipe</i>
<i>He held tight in his teeth</i>

22:17.681 --> 22:20.912
<i>And the smoke, it encircled his head</i>
<i>Like a wreath</i>

22:21.619 --> 22:24.986
<i>He had a broad face</i>
<i>And a round little belly</i>

22:25.155 --> 22:28.955
<i>That shook when he laughed</i>
<i>Like a bowlful of jelly</i>

22:29.126 --> 22:33.563
<i>He was chubby and plump</i>
<i>A right jolly old elf</i>

22:33.731 --> 22:36.666
<i>And I laughed when I saw him</i>
<i>In spite of myself</i>

22:37.334 --> 22:39.598
<i>A wink of his eye</i>
<i>And a twist of his head</i>

22:39.770 --> 22:43.262
<i>Soon gave me to know</i>
<i>I had nothing to dread</i>

22:43.574 --> 22:46.475
<i>He spoke not a word</i>
<i>But went straight to his work</i>

22:46.644 --> 22:50.375
<i>And filled all the stockings</i>
<i>Then turned with a jerk</i>

22:50.547 --> 22:53.277
<i>And laying his finger</i>
<i>Aside of his nose</i>

22:53.450 --> 22:56.942
<i>And giving a nod</i>
<i>Up the chimney he rose</i>

22:57.121 --> 23:00.454
<i>He sprang to his sleigh</i>
<i>To his team gave a whistle</i>

23:00.624 --> 23:04.958
<i>And away they all flew</i>
<i>Like the down of a thistle</i>

23:06.230 --> 23:09.961
<i>But I heard him exclaim</i>
<i>Ere he drove out of sight</i>

23:10.401 --> 23:15.566
Happy Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!
