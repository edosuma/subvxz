WEBVTT

00:34.784 --> 00:35.952
You did it again.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.039
You should really let me drive.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.375
You ain't driving.

00:44.627 --> 00:47.422
Look, you keep falling asleep.
You're gonna drive us into some ditch

00:47.505 --> 00:50.300
and then we'll freeze to death
in the middle of nowhere.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.434
Well, we should stop
till you get some rest, at least.

00:59.517 --> 01:03.313
Are you gonna keep an eye on me

01:03.396 --> 01:06.066
It's the least I can do
after you saved my life.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.025
Wow.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.403
That bullshit of yours, what...

01:10.487 --> 01:12.572
what kind of asshole
does that actually work on?

01:12.655 --> 01:13.615
I'm just wondering.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.159
Fine. Fine. You know what, forget it.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.119
Kill yourself just to prove a point.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.996
-How very male of you.
-Right.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.792
We're in the middle of nowhere.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.086
-Jesus Christ.
-How far do we plan to run, anyway?

01:30.757 --> 01:32.675
Whatever. Whatever.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.923
Go get us a room.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.467
-Just one?
-Just one.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.223
-Hey.
-Yeah?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.684
Don't do anything stupid, you got it?

02:23.685 --> 02:26.229
Look, why can't you
just let me go?

02:26.312 --> 02:27.897
I mean, seriously, we got away.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.984
The only place you're going
is in that office to get us a room.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.155
I'll need some money.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.590
Not suspicious at all.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.936
Christ.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.207
Hi.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.291
It's late.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.836
-Technically, I think it's early.
-You want a room?

03:34.380 --> 03:39.969
Uh, I don't suppose you got a bathroom
back there I could use, do you, Debbie?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.471
No, we don't.

03:41.554 --> 03:45.391
But there's all the facilities you might
need in the rooms if you rent one.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.018
That's what we do here.

03:47.101 --> 03:50.146
Please. I've been on the road all night.
I'm, like, really desperate here.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.522
We got a policy.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.567
List of facilities, the usual motel stuff.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.237
But we're clean.
My folks are strict on that.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.951
-I'll take a twin.
-All right, then.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.746
To be clear, this is for tonight,
not tomorrow, okay?

04:06.829 --> 04:08.331
That'll be another charge.

04:09.457 --> 04:14.504
Um, actually, that's... that's
not very clear at all. I mean, look.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.341
Sun's up. It's tomorrow, surely.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.009
Today, even.

04:20.093 --> 04:24.097
You check in before my night shift
finishes, it's not today.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.307
It's yesterday, sun or no sun.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.601
You want a room or not?

04:51.582 --> 04:53.418
Number seven, around back.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.238
Let's go.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.586
Sit on the bed. Go on.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.264
Damn it.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.401
Oh, God.

06:28.971 --> 06:29.806
Shit.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.237
Ah, shit.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.409
Thank you.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.494
You got a name I could use?

06:51.911 --> 06:53.496
Shit.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.876
Just call me Pete.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.755
-Pete?
-Yeah.

07:03.881 --> 07:04.924
I'm Rachel.

07:07.844 --> 07:11.556
Okay, Pete, so... what's the plan?

07:17.353 --> 07:18.938
Just go get in the bathroom.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.442
Go on. Go.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.703
Sit down.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.723
Wait. What are you do...

07:55.266 --> 07:58.186
Oh, youch.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.062
That is nasty, isn't it?

08:06.944 --> 08:08.196
Oh, shit.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.656
Hey, are you sure
you wouldn't rather be alone for this?

08:10.740 --> 08:12.325
I can leave.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.789
God...

08:21.459 --> 08:22.835
Open up the medicine kit.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.588
Go on.

08:41.646 --> 08:45.942
It must have been a ricochet.
It didn't go too deep.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.986
Every cloud, huh?

09:04.752 --> 09:06.837
Son of a bitch.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.298
Look, I'm gonna need you
to do this for me, all right?

09:11.759 --> 09:12.969
Come on, you figure you owe me.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.429
Just pick it up and do it for me,
for Chrissake.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.480
-What are you doing?
-Washing my hands.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.608
You want me digging around with these
after what we've been doing?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.004
All right, here goes.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.637
Is this, like, normal behavior for you?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.557
Like, getting shot, I mean.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.769
Well, not in the ass. First time for that.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.521
Get it. Get it.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.858
Ugh.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.196
All right, um... now what?

10:14.822 --> 10:16.616
I need you to stitch up the wound.

10:17.658 --> 10:18.659
Stitch...

10:18.743 --> 10:21.454
What

10:21.537 --> 10:24.373
No, I don't have the first idea
how to macramÃ© your backside.

10:24.457 --> 10:28.461
I don't give a shit what it looks like.
You just close up the wound. Do it now.

10:39.096 --> 10:42.933
Look, I really am grateful
for everything you did, okay?

10:43.017 --> 10:45.895
I mean it.
And I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.231
-Ah! Gah!
-Sucks. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry. Um...

10:49.857 --> 10:51.776
And I know you want answers. Anyone would.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.321
But I genuinely have no idea what this is.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.323
All right? I promise you.

10:57.907 --> 11:01.243
I think these people must have mistaken me
for somebody else, 'cause...

11:01.827 --> 11:05.873
I'm just some college student in town
for an interview at the university, and...

11:08.000 --> 11:09.377
Hey, mister, um...

11:11.170 --> 11:12.338
Pete, um...

11:14.674 --> 11:16.801
Look, I don't want any more trouble, okay?

11:18.094 --> 11:20.596
My parents are gonna start wondering
where the hell I am.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.182
So can you please, please, just let me go?

11:24.058 --> 11:25.059
You done?

11:25.142 --> 11:29.438
Please, listen to me, okay?
I need to go--

11:29.522 --> 11:31.941
With the stitching

11:34.485 --> 11:35.611
Oh, um...

11:37.530 --> 11:38.656
Yeah, I'm done.

11:43.786 --> 11:44.995
Get on the bed.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.464
No, no!

11:55.548 --> 11:57.049
Get your ass on the goddamn bed.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.687
-Give me your hands.
-What are you doing?

12:09.770 --> 12:11.647
-Give me your goddamn hands!
-No.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.107
-Look, hey, hey--
-Shut up.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.951
Hey, you really don't
have to do this, okay?

12:25.286 --> 12:27.371
I'm not gonna run again. I promise.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.256
You want your shoes on or off?

12:39.675 --> 12:40.926
-Screw you.
-Okay.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.179
-Suit yourself.
-Yeah.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.514
God...

12:45.598 --> 12:47.099
Oh, God.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.897
What are you doing?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.192
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.943
I suggest you do the same.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.779
You just...

12:59.862 --> 13:02.448
Um, you can't just
leave me here like this.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.494
You're gonna try and get some sleep?
Okay, well, I'm gonna wake you up.

13:06.577 --> 13:09.121
And I'm gonna wake up
everybody else in this motel, too.

13:09.205 --> 13:12.541
And let 'em know that Pete...
whatever-your-last-name-is

13:12.625 --> 13:15.377
tied me up, okay? God...

13:15.461 --> 13:18.506
Let me go. Let me go. Let me go.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.591
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:34.730 --> 13:36.106
Sleep tight.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.156
Kill me.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.326
Dying's easy.

15:33.682 --> 15:34.725
Morning, Billy.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.981
Looks like you were dreaming again.
Anything interesting?

15:42.191 --> 15:43.609
Why do you come here?

15:50.532 --> 15:53.327
I don't know you.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.792
That's right, you don't.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.925
You must be Agent Madani.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.094
Glad I finally caught you.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.682
You are?

16:15.391 --> 16:18.477
Dr. Dumont. I've been working
with Mr. Russo for months.

16:20.396 --> 16:24.817
Then I suppose you know that he's faking
this whole "I can't remember" act.

16:24.900 --> 16:28.153
No. Right now he doesn't have
the means to fake anything.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.990
How are you doing, Billy?

16:31.740 --> 16:33.075
My face hurts.

16:33.784 --> 16:34.994
Head, too.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.082
-Did you sleep?
-Some. I guess.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.209
I don't know.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.673
It's time for Mr. Russo's
assigned therapy.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.675
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.223
You do know what he did, right

16:57.057 --> 16:58.600
Is that in your file?

16:59.768 --> 17:02.563
My patient's alleged crimes
are not my concern.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.898
I'm only interested in his health.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.153
Gotta build the jigsaw.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.822
-Isn't that right?
-That's right.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.449
What's he talking about?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.368
We've been using the metaphor
that Billy's injuries

17:16.452 --> 17:19.580
turned his memories and identity
into a jigsaw puzzle.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.207
I'm here to help him solve it.

17:22.916 --> 17:27.046
That man is the best liar I've ever seen,
and I deal with liars professionally.

17:27.129 --> 17:32.134
Whereas my job is to help my patients
discover the truth and deal with it.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.720
Whatever that new reality might be.

17:34.803 --> 17:35.846
Simple.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.016
Life behind bars.

17:40.642 --> 17:44.438
I don't expect you to understand,
given the circumstances.

17:45.564 --> 17:49.485
I'm aware that you suffered a major
head trauma of your own, Agent Madani.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.779
Have you sought therapy?

17:57.493 --> 17:59.369
I'm getting exactly what I need.
Don't worry.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.336
See you tonight, Russo.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.723
Are you okay?

18:23.477 --> 18:26.522
I did something to her, didn't I?

18:29.566 --> 18:32.945
Well, we talked about this before,
recently. You don't remember?

18:33.654 --> 18:34.613
No.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.448
Not even that we spoke about it?

18:36.532 --> 18:40.244
No! All right?
I can't remember everything!

18:41.620 --> 18:44.540
We talk so damn much!

19:01.181 --> 19:02.891
Head hurts.

19:03.892 --> 19:08.480
Can I get some Tylenol
or something before we start?

19:08.564 --> 19:09.940
I'll talk to the nurse.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.156
What was it?

19:24.538 --> 19:26.081
What was it that I did to her?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.170
You shot her in the head.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.315
Who are you?

20:33.398 --> 20:35.567
You have a lot of people
who care about you.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.865
I'm sorry, do I know you?

20:43.325 --> 20:47.079
The right loving sentiment can be
so uplifting when we need healing.

20:50.123 --> 20:53.919
"Beth, take this as the universe
telling you to watch more TV."

20:55.295 --> 20:56.672
I don't know about that.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.387
From the handwriting,
it looks like you have a boy.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.683
Yeah, to have a son is a blessing.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.687
"Rex." Strong name.

21:12.938 --> 21:16.733
Beth, we're gonna talk
about a name, you and I.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.902
Before we do,

21:18.986 --> 21:21.530
I want you to think
about all of these people...

21:22.322 --> 21:24.157
whose names are on these cards
that I just read,

21:24.241 --> 21:25.951
because these names I know.

21:26.910 --> 21:27.911
Okay?

21:30.914 --> 21:31.915
Good.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.794
Now I need the name of the man at the bar.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.047
You know who I mean?

21:39.965 --> 21:42.050
Who was the man who brought you here?

21:45.512 --> 21:46.972
Are you a cop?

21:48.598 --> 21:49.433
Hmm?

21:51.143 --> 21:54.229
Cops asked me the same thing.
I said I don't know.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.691
He risked his life to save yours.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.031
Now, I want to believe
that you're a good woman.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.783
That God spared you because of that.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.244
So that you could be a good mother to Rex.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.163
You leave my baby out of this.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.915
Beth, I need to find this man.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.460
He's just a guy.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.172
He's just a guy I met at the bar.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.343
We spent one night together.
You know how it goes. You know?

22:24.926 --> 22:28.597
Yeah. Yes, I know how it goes.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.018
This is the wages of sin.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.147
He brought this on you,
but that all can end here.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.024
What is his name?

22:52.496 --> 22:54.998
Pete.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.797
Okay? He said his name was Pete.
That's all I know.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.136
There's something you're not telling me.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.223
I can see it in you, Beth.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.393
A vow before God
is not to be taken lightly.

23:16.895 --> 23:22.901
Whatever happens when I leave this room
cannot be taken back.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.403
Do you understand?

23:25.821 --> 23:27.989
You owe this man nothing.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.090
Castiglione.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.603
I'll say a prayer for your healing.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.177
You know, that actually really hurts.

24:31.386 --> 24:32.596
Cry me a river.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.317
You know, you, uh...

24:46.693 --> 24:48.403
You got a lot of people killed last night.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.238
I didn't kill anyone.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.741
Hmm. Okay.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.204
Let's do this one more time, okay?
Just once.

24:58.371 --> 25:01.833
Who are those people

25:02.834 --> 25:05.962
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't know.

25:06.046 --> 25:09.674
Because you're a college student, right?
Just in from out of town.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.345
Why aren't you screaming right now?

25:14.846 --> 25:17.140
Why didn't you say anything
to that woman at the front?

25:18.642 --> 25:22.896
See, I think you're full of shit, Rachel.
I think you're hidin' something.

25:23.813 --> 25:24.814
What is it?

25:26.441 --> 25:27.442
No?

25:29.486 --> 25:31.821
Okay.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.073
Let's do it my way.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.535
No, no, no. No, no, no.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.911
-Stop, stop. Stop.
-What is that?

25:37.994 --> 25:39.079
-No, no, no.
-What is that?

25:39.162 --> 25:42.499
What are these -It's a school project. I told you.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.918
That's bullshit.
What's in here, pictures?

25:45.001 --> 25:46.378
-What's in the--
-No, don't! Please!

25:46.461 --> 25:48.213
What's in the goddamn pictures? Answer me!

25:48.296 --> 25:50.215
I don't know, okay?

25:50.298 --> 25:53.426
If these maniacs chasing after us
could give me, like, three seconds,

25:53.510 --> 25:55.011
I can explain and they could have them.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.931
You gonna have a talk with them

25:58.014 --> 25:59.099
Let me explain something.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.351
The only reason you're around right now
is because of me.

26:01.434 --> 26:05.272
You see, they're comin' after us both now.
That's where you got lucky.

26:05.355 --> 26:08.567
See, the way I operate,
the way I handle situations like this...

26:09.109 --> 26:11.736
I kill the enemy before they get to me.
That's what I do.

26:11.820 --> 26:15.156
Mmm. That's a real...
that's a really interesting philosophy.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.825
Yeah, real sustainable.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.201
Well, works for me.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.787
Says the guy with the bullet hole
in his keister.

26:26.626 --> 26:30.338
Look, we could disappear, okay?
I can make us some IDs.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.174
Seriously, I do it all the time.
It's not a big problem.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.426
Where'd you learn that?

26:34.509 --> 26:36.428
Was that in college

26:36.511 --> 26:38.221
Thought we were being honest
with each other.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.472
Yeah, see.

26:39.556 --> 26:42.684
You haven't been straight with me
since I saved your goddamn life.

26:42.767 --> 26:47.689
You know, it really must get so tiring
being so angry all the time.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.399
Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.694
I was in a pretty mellow place
before all this shit went down.

26:52.777 --> 26:53.778
I was.

26:54.571 --> 26:55.864
I don't know, I guess...

26:56.906 --> 26:58.199
it's my fault.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.828
It's my fault. I guess I'm old-fashioned.

27:01.911 --> 27:04.748
If it'd been a man those assholes
were goin' after, I'll tell you what,

27:04.831 --> 27:06.499
I would've bought a beer,
would've sat back,

27:06.583 --> 27:07.709
I would've watched the show.

27:07.792 --> 27:10.253
But see, they... they came after you.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.006
A little girl. I had to...

27:13.798 --> 27:15.050
to get involved.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.719
It's my own damn fault.

27:20.805 --> 27:23.308
-It is what it is, I guess.
-It's what you made it.

27:24.392 --> 27:27.312
-Come again?
-I said it's what you made it.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.733
I was in that bar, remember?

27:33.902 --> 27:36.780
You didn't hesitate. Not for one second.

27:38.490 --> 27:42.118
You know, it's almost like you
were happy for the excuse.

27:45.914 --> 27:46.915
Yeah...

27:49.584 --> 27:50.877
I'm gonna go out.

27:51.878 --> 27:52.879
Okay?

27:55.340 --> 27:58.468
No, no, no. You don't need that again.
Trust me.

27:58.551 --> 28:01.096
No You sure?

28:01.179 --> 28:02.681
-Promise.
-Yeah?

28:03.515 --> 28:04.599
Yeah.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.705
I thought it was
worth us reviewing your symptom inventory,

29:08.788 --> 29:09.789
see what's changed.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.000
Sure.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.919
You look stronger, physically.

29:15.003 --> 29:18.006
Much as I can. Can't run.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.759
They won't let me use the gym, but...

29:21.926 --> 29:24.429
push-ups, crunches, all that.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.474
Stronger every day.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.018
But the exercise isn't helping you sleep?

29:33.438 --> 29:34.439
No.

29:35.774 --> 29:36.983
Still a three?

29:44.365 --> 29:45.950
You're still having the dreams?

29:46.034 --> 29:47.327
Yes.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.788
-Tell me about them.
-We've been over this 100 times.

29:49.871 --> 29:50.830
Indulge me.

29:55.752 --> 29:56.753
I see...

29:59.714 --> 30:01.966
-Yeah, it's me. I'm here.
-...the skull.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.223
Blood...

30:10.892 --> 30:12.727
Breaking glass. Always the same.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.946
And they instill feelings of dread?

30:23.029 --> 30:24.656
Always the same.

30:25.698 --> 30:26.783
They're just dreams, okay?

30:26.866 --> 30:29.118
-Scared during the dreams?
-I don't know. I don't remember.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.996
Do you experience feelings of anxiety
while you're awake?

30:34.958 --> 30:37.669
You know I do. What-- Why?

30:38.419 --> 30:40.004
Why do we have to keep doing this?

30:40.088 --> 30:42.507
One day your answers
are gonna be different,

30:43.091 --> 30:44.884
and that will matter.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.095
Better or the same?

30:48.930 --> 30:50.056
The same.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.434
The headaches.

30:54.143 --> 30:56.688
My face, it... it hurts.

30:57.897 --> 31:00.358
The doctor tells me there's no reason
your face should hurt you.

31:00.441 --> 31:03.987
Well, it's not his face, is it

31:05.196 --> 31:06.531
What, you think I'm lying?

31:06.614 --> 31:07.991
That's not what I said.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.495
Do you remember how your face got hurt?

31:13.454 --> 31:14.455
No.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.666
Who was there?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.962
No.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.964
What is the last thing
you remember clearly?

31:30.305 --> 31:34.809
Barracks. You know, like... with my unit.

31:36.561 --> 31:37.854
Shooting the shit.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.650
Frank was being an asshole,
and we were all laughing at him.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.319
Frank was your friend?

31:50.199 --> 31:51.326
My brother.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.996
-Where is he now?
-I don't know.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.748
I can't remember.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.500
Why

32:02.462 --> 32:06.925
You know that... it only matters up here.
I don't know what's real and what's not.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.719
-You understand the facts.
-I know what I've been told.

32:12.555 --> 32:16.517
But I can't feel any of it.

32:20.438 --> 32:24.233
Can I...
Can I please get that Tylenol? My...

32:24.859 --> 32:26.778
My head is slamming.

32:51.719 --> 32:55.890
Castiglione paid cash for one night.
Room 29.

32:59.686 --> 33:03.064
Clerk said that his bed
hadn't even been slept in,

33:03.147 --> 33:05.566
which tallies with him getting lucky
with the bar chick.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.279
The miracle of technology.

33:11.072 --> 33:16.661
Okay, so, DMV has
"Peter Castiglione" from New York.

33:17.578 --> 33:21.499
No criminal record,
and no government or military service.

33:21.582 --> 33:25.003
He looks clean.
Maybe he really was a bystander.

33:26.921 --> 33:27.922
No.

33:29.924 --> 33:32.510
No, he's not. He's something else.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.351
Do you really believe
that technology is a miracle?

33:41.185 --> 33:43.896
You got to admit,
there's some pretty cool shit, right?

33:46.774 --> 33:50.278
Where would the world be without it?
Everything would just stop.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.366
We can hope.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.877
Please don't use any more profanity.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.718
So 24 is open?

34:13.801 --> 34:16.054
-Yeah.
-All right. I'll take it.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.598
That's a twin.
You said there's only one of you.

34:18.681 --> 34:19.849
But that's the room I want.

34:19.932 --> 34:22.894
Yeah, but say if some couple of folks
turn up wanting a room

34:22.977 --> 34:25.980
and I can't give them one because you're
in my last two-bed situation?

34:26.064 --> 34:28.775
What, are you expecting a rush

34:28.858 --> 34:31.861
No, but it's the principle of the thing.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.447
What do mean, "principle of the thing"?
That's the room I want.

34:34.530 --> 34:37.325
-Okay. 69 bucks.
-You gotta be kidding me.

34:37.408 --> 34:40.745
You want the twin,
I gotta charge you double occupancy.

34:40.828 --> 34:41.662
All right.

34:41.746 --> 34:42.747
Hmm.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.378
-You're a real gem, lady.
-Mmm-hmm.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.004
Thanks. My hero.

35:59.615 --> 36:00.700
Uh...

36:01.993 --> 36:05.746
Hey... what's with the new crazy?

36:23.806 --> 36:26.517
Am I supposed to guess
what I've done to disappoint you, Rafi?

36:27.101 --> 36:28.853
You've got that vaguely paternal,

36:28.936 --> 36:31.355
"about to deliver tough love" look
that I know so well.

36:33.274 --> 36:37.445
We received another complaint about
your twice-daily visits to Billy Russo.

36:37.528 --> 36:38.529
Good.

36:39.614 --> 36:43.492
-Means I'm getting to him.
-Billy Russo is no longer your concern.

36:45.578 --> 36:48.998
Russo will always be my concern.

36:49.081 --> 36:51.083
I've told you,
he's playing them all for fools.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.460
No matter what you do next...

36:53.294 --> 36:55.713
you can never change the fact
that Russo fooled you.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.381
How much that pisses you off--

36:57.465 --> 37:00.760
No, you don't know. You can't know.
And the fact you just said what you said

37:00.843 --> 37:04.138
means you can't even get close
to understanding.

37:08.976 --> 37:09.977
Thank you.

37:12.104 --> 37:17.068
We worked very hard
to keep Homeland out of the Russo issue.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.986
It's an NYPD case.

37:19.070 --> 37:23.658
You risk compromising any trial
if Russo is ever deemed fit to stand.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.619
I told you, it's an act, Rafi.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.581
I look into his eyes,
and I can see him in there,

37:30.665 --> 37:31.999
laughing at them all.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.836
I wish Castle
had actually finished the damn job.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.881
-If only for your sake.
-Yeah, well, I don't.

37:38.965 --> 37:41.717
'Cause then Russo would have gone
to his grave thinking he killed me.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.179
You have to stay away, Dinah.

37:45.263 --> 37:50.559
You're an SAC, and you have a job to do,
and it no longer involves Billy Russo.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.562
You know, let's skip dinner.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.066
You've accomplished your mission, right?

37:57.149 --> 37:58.067
Come on.

37:58.150 --> 38:00.695
We have plenty of other things
we can talk about.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.113
Happier things.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.991
-Future, not past.
-I'll take a rain check.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.159
Thanks for the drink.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.677
You know how to use that?

38:24.760 --> 38:26.470
No, and I don't want to.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.806
Yeah? Yeah, suit yourself.

38:29.724 --> 38:33.561
You know, there's bad guys out there.
Pretty soon they're gonna be in here. Hmm?

38:38.733 --> 38:39.734
Good choice.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.487
You just point and shoot.
There's no safety.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.782
If you run out of bullets,
it probably means we're both dead.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.703
That's their vehicle.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.373
Gonna call this in to your guy?

38:54.457 --> 38:55.624
No.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.836
He's weird, gives me the creeps.

39:00.004 --> 39:03.257
Besides, I don't need some out-of-town
asshole telling me how to do my job.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.301
Next time I speak to him,
it's gonna be to tell him

39:05.384 --> 39:07.345
we got the job done
and we need to get paid.

39:08.888 --> 39:11.432
Can we please just leave

39:11.515 --> 39:13.517
There's people out there
that wanna kill you.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.491
You're gonna move and let me leave.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.704
-Is that right?
-Move.

39:34.246 --> 39:36.499
I'll tell you what.
You wanna shoot me, shoot me.

39:48.302 --> 39:49.303
That's right.

39:51.138 --> 39:52.473
Not so easy, is it?

39:53.140 --> 39:54.225
Let's do it.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.582
He's in there. The girl, too.

41:22.897 --> 41:23.731
Shit.

41:44.752 --> 41:45.753
Pete?

41:48.047 --> 41:49.381
Pete, are you there?

42:23.791 --> 42:25.251
Don't even think about it.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.632
Give me the gun.

42:32.841 --> 42:34.301
Get that bag. We gotta go.

42:35.636 --> 42:36.762
-Let's go.
-Okay.

42:58.909 --> 43:00.703
Hey. You okay?

43:01.579 --> 43:02.621
Then we gotta move.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.625
Let's go.

43:06.709 --> 43:09.420
Come on, let's move. We gotta go. Move.

44:24.370 --> 44:25.996
You ready to talk?

44:26.080 --> 44:28.499
-Kiss my ass.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.254
See you later, maniac.

44:47.935 --> 44:50.104
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

44:50.688 --> 44:52.773
Don't move!
Get out of the car!

44:53.941 --> 44:55.901
-On your knees!
-Step back!

44:55.984 --> 44:57.861
-Step back!
-Hands behind your head!

44:57.945 --> 44:59.363
Hands behind your head.

44:59.446 --> 45:01.448
Hands behind your head!

45:13.419 --> 45:15.504
This is bullshit.

45:15.587 --> 45:16.797
You gotta get me to a hospital.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.382
Nearest one's 45 minutes,

45:18.465 --> 45:20.634
and chances are
they'd just call me in, anyway.

45:20.718 --> 45:21.760
Yeah.

45:26.807 --> 45:28.016
How is she?

45:28.600 --> 45:29.810
I gotta take her anyplace else?

45:29.893 --> 45:31.395
Damn right you do.

45:32.646 --> 45:35.232
She's a tough girl. She'll be fine.

45:35.816 --> 45:38.944
Crazy old bird has no idea
what she's talking about.

45:39.027 --> 45:42.197
Bullet went through and through
the meat. Missed the bone.

45:42.823 --> 45:46.493
She got real lucky.
Or it was one hell of a shot.

45:48.829 --> 45:52.082
You know, right now,
you look like a victim here.

45:52.875 --> 45:55.294
So why not just tell us
what the hell just happened?

45:58.881 --> 46:01.508
He put me into his van at gunpoint

46:01.592 --> 46:04.261
and then he tied me to the bed
in that motel.

46:07.723 --> 46:11.852
Oh, God, I can't even bear to think
about what he was planning on doing.

46:12.853 --> 46:16.940
And then all those other people showed up,
and everybody just started shooting.

46:17.024 --> 46:19.777
And then I saw a chance to get out,
so I ran to the van,

46:19.860 --> 46:22.780
and I was driving away,
and that's when you guys showed up.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.161
I've never been so happy
to see anybody in my life.

46:31.789 --> 46:36.084
So you don't know who they are
or why they were fighting?

46:37.461 --> 46:38.462
Look...

46:38.545 --> 46:42.508
I'm just a kid who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time, Sheriff.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.095
That right?

46:49.556 --> 46:50.557
Yeah.

46:51.642 --> 46:52.935
Yeah, and...

46:54.394 --> 46:59.233
I'm 16, so should we even really be
having this conversation right now?

47:00.651 --> 47:02.569
I mean, maybe you want
to call Child Services

47:02.653 --> 47:04.279
to come down here and get me?

47:08.575 --> 47:12.246
I've done what I can here,
but I'm pretty sure that hand's broken.

47:12.329 --> 47:14.498
-He needs an X-ray to be sure.
-Ah, it's fine.

47:19.253 --> 47:21.088
He need to go anywhere
straight away?

47:21.171 --> 47:22.631
No hospitals.

47:22.714 --> 47:24.341
So you're refusing medical treatment?

47:24.424 --> 47:27.678
That's right.
Guess that works for both of us, huh?

47:28.762 --> 47:29.847
It's up to you.

47:30.764 --> 47:32.683
Good thing you're left-handed, I guess.

47:38.355 --> 47:39.565
Like I said...

47:41.233 --> 47:43.777
lucky or one hell of a shot.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.863
And lookin' at this one,
I know which I'd guess.

47:47.948 --> 47:49.867
Maybe you should
send 'em both to the hospital.

47:49.950 --> 47:51.618
Let the staties have this one, Roy.

47:52.744 --> 47:54.121
This is our town.

47:54.204 --> 47:55.539
And they ain't from it.

47:57.791 --> 47:59.877
Not my place to tell you your job.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.682
You want to explain any of this to me?

49:23.377 --> 49:26.922
Some cops in Ohio just put Marlena,

49:27.005 --> 49:29.716
some girl and Castiglione's prints
into the system.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.056
Ask, and it shall be given unto you.

49:39.559 --> 49:41.395
Seek, and ye shall find.

49:43.814 --> 49:46.274
Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.102
Madani.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.523
It's Pete Castiglione.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.609
I got a problem, and I need your help.

50:29.693 --> 50:32.320
Some people came after me,
and I killed them for it.

50:32.863 --> 50:36.366
I'm in Ohio, police precinct,
small town called Larkville.

50:36.450 --> 50:38.493
What

50:39.244 --> 50:40.287
Yeah, that's right.

50:40.370 --> 50:42.914
Frank, you can't just kill people
when you feel like it.

50:42.998 --> 50:45.500
Yeah, unless it suits the government.
Ain't that right, Madani?

50:46.168 --> 50:48.879
I just figured you and your...
your high-powered friends,

50:48.962 --> 50:50.630
you wouldn't like it if I just resurfaced.

50:50.714 --> 50:53.383
Forget it. You don't exist anymore.
We buried you.

50:53.467 --> 50:55.677
Your get-out-of-jail-free card
was a one-time deal, Frank.

50:55.761 --> 50:57.345
You're a new man with your own problems.

50:57.429 --> 50:59.264
Want the name of a lawyer,
I can recommend one.

50:59.347 --> 51:01.391
I don't need a goddamn lawyer.
I need your help.

51:01.475 --> 51:05.062
Frank, you're no longer part of my life.
Do not call this number again.

51:20.994 --> 51:22.162
Nobody home.

51:28.794 --> 51:31.004
You're looking
at four counts of murder.

51:31.088 --> 51:32.964
That's a death penalty crime in Ohio.

51:33.048 --> 51:35.634
-I didn't murder anybody, Sheriff.
-You telling me you didn't do it?

51:35.717 --> 51:37.677
They died from terminal stupidity.

51:43.016 --> 51:44.935
You wanna tell me what's goin' on?

51:45.018 --> 51:47.270
I think you need to listen
to the doctor, Sheriff.

51:48.814 --> 51:51.358
You care about these people

51:53.401 --> 51:55.278
'Cause if you do, you need to let us go.

51:56.780 --> 51:58.115
You know I can't do that.

51:59.908 --> 52:00.909
Yeah.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.329
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.
