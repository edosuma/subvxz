(man)
No, we didn't forget
about you.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.577
Yeah. It's all here.
I'm looking at it now.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.144
Two cans tomato paste.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.413
One 16-ounce box
farfalle pasta.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.250
One box of Glad ForceFlex
trash bags.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.118
One, two, three,
four candy bars.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.521
And a bunch of bananas.

00:20.553 --> 00:23.190
Yeah, he'll be there
in ten minutes.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.227
You know the address, right?

00:26.260 --> 00:28.096
You going out tonight
trick-or-treating?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.496
I think I'm a little old.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.664
Hell, I went
trick-or-treating

00:30.698 --> 00:31.765
all through high school.

00:31.798 --> 00:34.335
That'll be $5.51.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.573
Here you go.

00:40.607 --> 00:41.808
Thank you.
Thanks.

00:41.841 --> 00:43.176
You have
a good night.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.811
You too.
Hi.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.396
Hello. Hello.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.498
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

01:04.531 --> 01:07.067
Um, do you have
a light?

01:11.204 --> 01:13.774

01:37.631 --> 01:41.435

everywhere *

01:41.468 --> 01:44.337
* No one seems to care

01:44.371 --> 01:45.406

Get some good shots of the gun?

02:32.219 --> 02:34.788
Yeah. Um, shoot
this crowd too.

02:34.822 --> 02:35.956
You never know.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.491
Halloween. Am I right?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.694
Something nasty
always goes down on Halloween.

02:40.728 --> 02:41.461
Really.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.798
What went down
last Halloween?

02:44.831 --> 02:46.699
Nothing.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.701
The one before that?

02:48.735 --> 02:50.937
It's a new tradition.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.643
Halloween.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.247
Oh.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.550
I know this store.
It used to be called McCabes.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.217
I grew up four blocks away.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.454
After school, all the kids
would hang out right here

03:06.486 --> 03:08.322
in the parking lot
drinking sodas

03:08.355 --> 03:09.723
and listening to music.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.591
That sounds like fun.

03:10.623 --> 03:11.658
Oh, yeah.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.227
It was a lot of fun.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.763
I used to stand over there
across the street.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.730
I had a perfect view.

03:17.764 --> 03:20.901
Good times. Good times.

03:20.933 --> 03:22.370
(Stottlemeyer)
Hey, Monk.

03:22.402 --> 03:23.570
Thanks for coming.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.272
Uh, it's kind of ugly.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.740
The driver stopped
around 1:15 for lunch.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.776
He's on his way back
to the truck

03:29.810 --> 03:31.844
when the shooter came up,
grabbed his gun.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.847
Shoots him four,
maybe five times

03:33.881 --> 03:35.716
point blank range.

03:35.748 --> 03:37.718
But he keeps shooting him
even after the guy

03:37.751 --> 03:38.985
went down.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.254
Oh my God.
Was he married?
I don't know.

03:41.288 --> 03:42.323
Any kids?

03:42.355 --> 03:43.723
I don't know, Natalie.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.692
I just got here myself.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.695
With his own gun?

03:48.728 --> 03:50.298
There must've
been witnesses.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.699
Yeah, a few people
from the store.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.033
Caucasian. Dark hair.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.502
Maybe a blue sweater
or jacket.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.903
We're going
to question them again.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.972
How much did he get?

03:59.006 --> 04:00.574
The truck is empty.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.376
That's all I know.

04:10.818 --> 04:11.919
Hey, get out of there.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.486
Go. [claps hands]

04:13.521 --> 04:14.822
Ho ho. Get!

04:14.854 --> 04:18.692
I hate pigeons.
Like rats with wings.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.026
There's no defensive wounds.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.562
Was there a struggle?

04:21.595 --> 04:23.363
How did--how did this guy
get the gun?

04:23.396 --> 04:24.665
That's a good question.

04:24.697 --> 04:26.667
The M.E.'s gonna be here
in a minute.

04:26.699 --> 04:27.668
We can ask him.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.603
What's this?

04:32.605 --> 04:35.007
This hasn't been here long.
It's clean.

04:37.644 --> 04:38.911
That's a clove cigarette.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.613
They make them
in Indonesia.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.682
People use them
to try to quit smoking.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.084
They don't work.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.052
Driver's?

04:45.084 --> 04:46.887
The driver has his own.
[cell phone rings]

04:46.920 --> 04:49.490
I'm thinking
it's the shooter's.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.425
Well, run that down.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.427
Every store
that sells those.
Hello.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.829
No, Sharona's not here
anymore.

04:55.862 --> 04:59.567
Uh, about a year ago.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.369
Well, I don't know
what happened.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.672
She moved to New Jersey.

05:04.704 --> 05:05.805
Sir, I don't know
what happened.

05:05.838 --> 05:08.576
You'd have to ask her.
Who is this?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.981
Mr. Monk,
it's your brother.

05:15.014 --> 05:16.550
Ambrose?

05:16.584 --> 05:18.519
I can't. I, uh--

05:18.552 --> 05:20.019
Tell him
I'll call him back.

05:20.052 --> 05:21.120
Tell him I'm busy.

05:21.153 --> 05:22.622
Your father called.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.759
My father?

05:25.793 --> 05:28.060
He's coming home.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.045
See? You can
trick-or-treat here.

05:45.077 --> 05:46.613
I'll go with you.

05:46.646 --> 05:49.750
Oh, fun. Trick-or-treating
with your mom.

05:49.783 --> 05:54.822
She's at that impossible age,
between 11 and 25.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.730
What?
You okay?

06:03.764 --> 06:06.567
What do I say to him
after all these years?

06:06.600 --> 06:11.103
You say, "Hello, Dad.

06:11.137 --> 06:14.574
I missed you."

06:14.608 --> 06:19.612
No. No, I can't say that.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.485
Why did he leave
just like that?

06:25.519 --> 06:28.456
It was my fault.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.557
I drove him crazy.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.625
He said that.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.093
No.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.927
Then how do you know?

06:34.961 --> 06:37.096
I-I-I know.
I-I just know.

06:37.129 --> 06:39.567
Mr. Monk,
you can't blame yourself.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.569
You wanna bet?

06:41.601 --> 06:43.870
Julie, okay,
be nice, okay?

06:43.903 --> 06:45.572
Remember
what we talked about?

06:45.605 --> 06:47.774
Mr. Monk's brother's ill.
He's agoraphobic.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.744
I know.
He never leaves his house.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.213
He left once.
Once in 34 years.

06:53.245 --> 06:54.715
At least he left.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.584
Well, the house
was on fire.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.884
I had to drag him out.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.687
[knocks on door]

07:06.726 --> 07:09.196
Adrian.
You talked to him?

07:09.228 --> 07:10.730
I told you he'd be back.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.199
He's in town
on a business trip.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.235
He said he'd be here
at 8:00 sharp.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.004
You gave up.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.540
But I never gave up.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.007
I never gave up. Nev--

07:21.040 --> 07:22.643
Are you trick-or-treating?

07:22.675 --> 07:26.012
No. No. This is Natalie,
my new assistant.

07:26.045 --> 07:27.880
You spoke
on the phone.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.016
Enchanter de vous
rencontrer.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.019
I'm Ambrose Monk,

07:33.052 --> 07:34.788
Adrian's brother.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.524
Ambrose Monk.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.625
Yes, I know.
Very nice to meet you, Ambrose.

07:39.692 --> 07:40.661
Yes.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.529
Uh...

07:42.562 --> 07:44.865
This is my daughter,
Julie.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.668
I like your costume.
You're a cardiologist.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.702
I'm a doctor.
No.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.971
You're a cardiologist.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.574
You see, that stethoscope has
a built-in concave amplifier.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.576
It's called a Stethron.

07:55.608 --> 07:59.278
Cardiologists use it
to listen for heart murmurs.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.281
Guess I'm a cardiologist.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.716
It's all right.

08:02.750 --> 08:06.687
I made a mistake once.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.855
Come--come in.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.963
Wow. This is spooky.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.766
Do you do this every year
for Halloween?

08:18.798 --> 08:20.701
Do what?

08:20.733 --> 08:23.103
Um, nothing.

08:23.136 --> 08:26.105
All these
instruction manuals.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.742
Yes, Ambrose wrote them.
That's what he does.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.177
Wow, Ambrose,
you must be pretty handy

08:30.209 --> 08:31.711
around the house.

08:31.745 --> 08:32.980
Yeah, you should've
been there

08:33.013 --> 08:35.048
when we were putting together
my Malibu Jenny Bungalow.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.716
It took my mom five hours.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.186
I'm not surprised.
Mike Gordon wrote that one.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.721
He's a hack.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.722
The man can't tell
the difference

08:42.755 --> 08:44.191
between a 3/4 inch
retaining screw

08:44.224 --> 08:45.592
and a half inch lag bolt.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.796
I'm not kidding.
He actually made that mistake.

08:48.828 --> 08:51.798
Still can't believe
he won the Niz-Em-Ew award.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.801
Niz-Em what?

08:53.834 --> 08:56.636
National Society
of Instruction Manual Writers.

08:56.669 --> 08:57.937
Oh. Right.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.306
I've won five of them.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.640
Can we see one?

09:00.673 --> 09:01.841
No.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.309
They're not here.

09:05.645 --> 09:06.679
They won't mail them.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.849
Well,
at least you won them.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.019
That's the important thing.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.187
[knock on door]

09:14.221 --> 09:16.690
It's the door.
Ambrose.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.726
[knock on door]

09:19.759 --> 09:21.227
The door.
'Scuse me.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.667
Trick-or-treat!
Trick-or-treat!

09:26.700 --> 09:28.802
Wait. Wait.
Not yet.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.302
Trick-or-treat.

09:30.336 --> 09:31.838
I've accepted your terms,

09:31.871 --> 09:34.073
which means we now have
an implied contract.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.743
By accepting this treat,

09:35.775 --> 09:38.010
you are in effect
promising to refrain

09:38.044 --> 09:41.014
from committing any tricks
against me or this property

09:41.048 --> 09:42.149
now or in the future.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.850
Are there any questions?
Yeah.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.619
Do you have any
Peanut Chews?

09:45.653 --> 09:46.687
There's only
what's in the bowl.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.722
Now, one per customer,
all right?

10:11.745 --> 10:12.812
Better?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.881
Oh, yeah.
It was cluttered before.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.519
(Ambrose)
What are you doing?

10:20.552 --> 10:22.389
You--you can't go
in there.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.725
You cannot go in there.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.729
I--I'm sorry.
I-I didn't know.

10:28.761 --> 10:29.562
What's going on?

10:29.596 --> 10:31.731
That--that is--
that's Dad's study.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.432
We're--we're--we're
not allowed in there.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.500
Not allowed?

10:34.533 --> 10:37.004
Yes. They caught me
in there once when I was 12.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.971
What happened, Ambrose?

10:39.005 --> 10:42.042
He grounded me.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.010
For 30 years?

10:44.043 --> 10:46.746
It's all right, Julie.

10:46.779 --> 10:47.914
Ambrose...

10:47.947 --> 10:49.917
what's the big deal?

10:49.950 --> 10:51.250
We'll just take
a look around.

10:51.283 --> 10:52.384
We're adults, right?

10:52.418 --> 10:54.053
You go in there,
I will tell.

10:54.086 --> 10:56.056
You better not.
I will!
I--I--I'm telling.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.924
Well, then I'm telling him
about the shaving kit.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.660
Don't! Adrian,
don't go in there.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.831
It has to be exactly the way
he left it.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.700
It's Daddy's study.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.769
Okay.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.236
Okay. I'm not going in.

11:10.269 --> 11:13.240
[doorbell rings]

11:13.273 --> 11:18.245
Excuse me, Natalie,
uh, Julie.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.713
I have trick-or-treaters.

11:20.748 --> 11:21.749
Sorry.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.321
[knocking]

11:36.797 --> 11:39.066
[growling]

11:39.099 --> 11:41.000
How old are you?

11:41.033 --> 11:42.469
[growling]

11:42.501 --> 11:45.004
'Cause I have a rule--
no one older than 14.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.842
Only one per customer.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.979
What are you doing?

11:52.011 --> 11:53.780
Only one per customer.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.148
Did you hear
what I said?

11:55.182 --> 11:58.018
No. No, only one
per customer.

12:00.019 --> 12:01.453
(Natalie)
Get out of here!

12:01.488 --> 12:02.755
Hey!

12:02.789 --> 12:03.823
[growling]
Get out of here!

12:03.856 --> 12:05.993
(Monk)
Hey! Hey!

12:06.025 --> 12:08.327
Ambrose, are you okay?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.129
Ambrose,
can you move?

12:10.163 --> 12:13.732
Did he get more
than one piece?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.109
Ow.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.244
Are you sure you're okay?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.546
The man who attacked you
was 5 1/2 feet tall.

12:26.578 --> 12:28.248
That's right.

12:28.280 --> 12:31.283
And he wore a green mask
with a bolt through the neck.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.286
Did he say anything?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.121
He said "Grr."

12:35.154 --> 12:38.290
No, no, no, no.
It was [growls]

12:38.325 --> 12:39.993
Write down Frankenstein.

12:40.027 --> 12:43.129
No, it wasn't Frankenstein.
It was Frankenstein's monster.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.831
Frankenstein is the name
of the scientist

12:44.865 --> 12:45.899
who created the monster.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.334
It doesn't really matter.

12:47.366 --> 12:48.902
Captain,

12:48.936 --> 12:50.803
you can't
just say Frankenstein,

12:50.837 --> 12:53.072
it'll confuse everybody.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.176
[mouths words silently]

12:56.209 --> 12:58.311
Okay, write down
Frankenstein's monster.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.048
(Natalie)
I saw the guy running south
towards the park.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.081
Maybe he's there.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.283
Look, it's probably
just some high school kid

13:04.317 --> 13:05.317
with the munchies.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.486
I don't think so.
He was wearing dress shoes.

13:07.519 --> 13:09.556
They were Italian.
Forzieris.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.091
You noticed that,
right?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.292
I'm not familiar...

13:12.325 --> 13:13.360
They're imported.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.261
They cost
about $420 a pair.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.397
It's not exactly something
a high school kid with munchies

13:17.429 --> 13:19.198
would be wearing.

13:19.231 --> 13:21.433
Okay, it was a rich high school
kid with the munchies.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.302
Look, I'm really sorry
that your candy got spilled,

13:23.336 --> 13:25.105
but this isn't a priority
for us right now.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.038
You might have heard

13:26.072 --> 13:28.075
that there was
an armored car driver shot

13:28.107 --> 13:29.142
just down the street.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.543
Right. Right.
How is that going?

13:30.576 --> 13:31.979
Uh, nothing yet.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.245
But get this.
The driver was off duty.

13:33.279 --> 13:34.914
The truck was empty
from the start.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.383
It was empty?

13:36.415 --> 13:39.219
(Stottlemeyer)
Yeah, I guess the shooter
didn't do his homework.

13:39.251 --> 13:40.988
Anyway, we're off
to question the cashier

13:41.020 --> 13:42.054
at the grocery store.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.123
Do you want to come?

13:43.155 --> 13:44.191
I could use
the help.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.092
I can't. My father.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.559
Oh, yeah.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.928
I understand.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.431
I hope that goes well
for you.

13:51.463 --> 13:52.565
I'll call you tomorrow.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.934
Come on, Lieutenant.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.436
What are you doing,
Lieutenant?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.205
Oh, I'm just--
Sorry, you can't
take that.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.072
I don't have
any extra.
It's just candy.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.207
I know how much
I need.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.342
Every year, I have it down
to a science

14:03.375 --> 14:05.044
based on current
weather conditions,

14:05.077 --> 14:06.212
recent census data,

14:06.245 --> 14:08.447
and the demand
from previous Halloweens.

14:08.480 --> 14:14.287
Last year, I ended up
with just one extra candy bar.

14:20.293 --> 14:24.297
Well, Ambrose,
that's, um...

14:24.331 --> 14:26.599
that's very...

14:26.633 --> 14:28.335
I don't know
what the hell that is.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.971
Come on, Lieutenant,
I'll buy you a Snickers bar.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.120
Adrian, could I--
could I talk to you?

14:48.154 --> 14:52.125
Yeah, one second.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.161
It's important.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.131
What?

14:59.165 --> 15:01.268
Out here.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.672
Stop it.
Stop.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.606
Sorry.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.623
All right, this way.

15:23.655 --> 15:25.057
Oh, no.

15:25.091 --> 15:29.229
So nobody can hear
what we're doing.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.697
It's a little dusty.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.299
All right, come on.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.466
Come on.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.702
[trips]
Ah!

15:36.735 --> 15:39.338
Oh, God.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.207
Okay.
Ssh.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.375
[whispering]
Okay. Okay.

15:43.409 --> 15:47.179
Are you and Natalie...

15:47.213 --> 15:49.182
What?

15:49.216 --> 15:51.150
Involved?

15:51.183 --> 15:53.186
What?

15:53.220 --> 15:54.653
No. No.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.657
No. No. Why--why
would you even ask me that?

15:57.690 --> 16:01.128
Well, it's been eight years
since Trudy.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.163
Exactly!

16:03.196 --> 16:05.097
It's only been
eight years.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.234
You're a widower.
She's a widow.

16:07.267 --> 16:11.171
And I know how you are
with the ladies.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.440
I remember, in high school,
those girls

16:13.472 --> 16:16.576
calling you on the phone,
talking to you on the phone,

16:16.609 --> 16:19.111
complimenting you, huh?

16:19.145 --> 16:21.114
Ambrose...

16:21.148 --> 16:24.051
those were my teachers.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.784
So?

16:25.817 --> 16:29.788
What about Mrs. Flagan?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.457
Yeah?

16:31.490 --> 16:34.527
Natalie works for me.

16:34.561 --> 16:39.231
Strictly professional,
okay?

16:39.265 --> 16:42.201
Is she seeing
anybody else?

16:45.371 --> 16:48.207
Why? Why?

16:59.786 --> 17:01.120
No reason.

17:03.755 --> 17:06.192
[doorbell rings]

17:07.259 --> 17:08.494
(kids)
Trick-or-treat!

17:08.528 --> 17:10.130
Oh, you guys
look amazing.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.332
I love it.
Here you go.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.303
Hey, Julie.
Hey, Frankie.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.438
Frankie's in my homeroom.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.638
So have you gone
trick-or-treating yet?

17:19.672 --> 17:21.240
If not,
you can come with us.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.242
Please, Mom?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.278
Okay. Be back by 8:00.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.413
Stick together.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.615
You guys stay on this side
of the freeway, all right?

17:29.648 --> 17:31.683
Here's my cell phone.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.452
And don't eat anything
until I inspect it!

17:33.486 --> 17:35.255
Bye, Mom.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.727
(Stottlemeyer)
Good job. Thank you.

17:40.759 --> 17:42.729
And you've never seen
this guy before?

17:42.761 --> 17:45.531
In the store?
Hanging around the parking lot?

17:45.565 --> 17:48.867
I don't think so.
But I see a lot of faces.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.538
Sure.
It looks like
Kiefer Sutherland.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.307
Yeah, I guess it does.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.777
It wasn't Kiefer Sutherland,
was it?

17:57.809 --> 18:00.413
No, sir.

18:02.848 --> 18:05.785
Here's a receipt.
This is from your cash register.

18:05.817 --> 18:07.653
This is him, right?
Mm-hmm.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.221
Eight items
at 89 cents.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.691
Yes, sir.
Eight candy bars.

18:11.723 --> 18:13.460
Eight candy bars?

18:13.492 --> 18:15.228
It really looks
like Kiefer Sutherland.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.330
You know, maybe we should--
before we distribute it--

18:18.365 --> 18:20.467
write across the bottom
"not Kiefer Sutherland"

18:20.500 --> 18:22.801
just so that we don't
disturb Mr. Sutherland.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.636
That's a really good idea.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.838
You think so?
No.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.178
Let's do this again.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.547
So he pays you,
then he walks out.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.249
A minute later,
you hear shots.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.349
You run to the window

18:37.384 --> 18:40.153
and see this guy
shooting the driver.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.153
Yes.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.355
And then he looks
in the back of the truck,

18:43.390 --> 18:44.423
sees it's empty,
and he takes off.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.925
No, sir. He never looked
in the back of the truck.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.127
Really.

19:07.380 --> 19:11.884
[kids talking and shouting]

19:11.917 --> 19:14.787
[kids screaming]

19:35.241 --> 19:36.542
What's he doing?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.244
You'll see. Ssh.

19:43.549 --> 19:44.651
Is he drunk?

19:44.683 --> 19:45.917
No, he's thinking.

19:45.951 --> 19:50.323
Okay. Now, he must have been
following you all

19:50.356 --> 19:51.357
quite a while.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.559
Can anybody tell me
which way he ran off?

19:53.593 --> 19:54.826
He went that way.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.628
I saw him turn left
on Hamilton Street.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.798
Uh-huh. You sure
you weren't hallucinating?

19:58.830 --> 20:00.299
Mr. Monk, he's 11 years old.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.933
He's not a real hippie.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.271
I got mine stolen too.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.739
About 20 minutes ago.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.941
Mine too.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.777
Okay, I want all of you

20:10.809 --> 20:13.913
who had your candy
stolen by Frankenstein

20:13.945 --> 20:15.682
to stand over here

20:15.714 --> 20:17.784
and the others
stand over here.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.251
Let's go.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.952
Here.
All right, here.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.321
You here.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.356
And you others.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.692
Good.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.930
So why you...

20:30.962 --> 20:32.598
but not you?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.002
And why you...

20:37.036 --> 20:38.971
but not you?

20:39.005 --> 20:42.741
Maybe he's afraid
of karate.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.009
Ha!
Oh.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.010
Or maybe he's afraid

20:45.044 --> 20:46.378
of pirates.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.013
No, that's just stupid.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.548
How many of you

20:49.582 --> 20:50.849
stopped by my brother's house?

20:50.883 --> 20:53.819
The big gray house
near the end of Oakview?

20:53.853 --> 20:55.488
You mean where
the special man lives

20:55.521 --> 20:57.324
who never comes out?

20:57.356 --> 20:58.357
Yeah. That's right.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.593
Where the special man
lives.

21:00.626 --> 21:03.695
How many...

21:05.765 --> 21:09.336
He's only taking candy from kids
who went to Ambrose's house?

21:09.368 --> 21:11.738
What's going on?
I don't know.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.507
I don't know.

21:24.416 --> 21:25.718
Wait a minute.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.819
(Natalie)
What?

21:27.854 --> 21:29.020
No.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.458
(Natalie)
What?

21:31.490 --> 21:32.491
No.

21:35.827 --> 21:38.064
It's a clove cigarette.

21:38.096 --> 21:40.467
Like the one
at the murder scene.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.479
Who was it this time?

21:52.511 --> 21:54.947
Dracula?
The Werewolf.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.548
No, no.
It was Frankenstein.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.817
(all)
Frankenstein's monster.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.923
Well, there's just no stopping
that crazy creature.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.924
He wants candy.
And not just any candy.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.527
He wants your candy.

22:07.559 --> 22:08.795
That's right, he's only
interested in candy

22:08.827 --> 22:09.996
from this house.

22:10.028 --> 22:13.400
You know, I can't help
but wonder why.

22:13.432 --> 22:16.403
The answer is here.
It is right in front of us.

22:16.435 --> 22:18.471
And you're saying
that this is somehow connected

22:18.505 --> 22:19.471
to the armored car thing.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.409
I-I bought all this candy
at Beach's Market.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.410
They deliver.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.511
And that's where
the driver was killed, right?

22:25.545 --> 22:27.513
Plus, I found this

22:27.547 --> 22:28.647
where the kids
were attacked.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.417
It's a clove cigarette.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.085
Actually, I researched these.
They're common.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.686
150 stores in this area
sell them.

22:34.721 --> 22:37.957
Okay, you're saying
that there is a connection.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.625
I'm here.
Convince me.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.493
Why would a killer

22:41.528 --> 22:43.430
who every cop in this city
is looking for,

22:43.462 --> 22:46.132
hang around to steal candy
from children?

22:58.744 --> 23:01.614
We don't know.

23:01.647 --> 23:03.650
You don't know.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.453
Can I go
trick-or-treating or not?

23:07.487 --> 23:08.520
No, not tonight,
sweetie.

23:08.555 --> 23:09.655
You promised.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.523
I only got to go
a little bit.

23:11.557 --> 23:12.991
Honey, there is a nut
out there.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.192
The only way
you can go now

23:14.226 --> 23:16.695
is with a police escort.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.597
Lieutenant Disher.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.567
Hmm?

23:20.599 --> 23:21.200
Come trick-or-treating
with me.

23:21.232 --> 23:24.202
Or. I don't, uh...

23:24.236 --> 23:25.471
Can I?

23:25.505 --> 23:26.673
No.

23:26.705 --> 23:30.009
Adrian, why don't
you go with her?

23:30.041 --> 23:31.176
What?

23:31.210 --> 23:34.814
Natalie can stay here
with me.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.617
And help me get ready.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.119
That is such a good idea.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.721
Right?

23:42.755 --> 23:45.892
It's not much
of a costume, is it?

23:45.924 --> 23:47.226
Sure, it is.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.061
I'm a safety
patrol officer.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.030
Hey! Hey!
Wait!

23:52.064 --> 23:55.768
Cross at the green,
not in-between!

23:55.801 --> 23:57.236
It's amazing
it still fits you.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.105
When was the last time
you wore it?

23:59.137 --> 24:00.239
Third grade?

24:00.271 --> 24:02.741
College.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.059
Oh, I found some pictures.
I hope you don't mind.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.796
No. No.
[sniffs]

24:26.065 --> 24:27.500
Is that your father?

24:27.534 --> 24:29.035
Oh, that's him
and Ambrose.

24:29.067 --> 24:31.503
He named the turtle
after you?

24:31.538 --> 24:35.273
He named me
after the turtle.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.544
Oh, Ambrose.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.950
[laughs]
Oh, I like this one.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.284
You look so happy.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.252
Mom was worried about us
because we never laughed.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.788
So she made us practice.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.523
That's us practicing.

24:51.557 --> 24:53.826
So now I can laugh...
[chuckles weakly]

24:53.859 --> 24:56.563
if I have to.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.538
What about this one?

25:05.571 --> 25:07.640
That was taken the day
before he left.

25:11.242 --> 25:14.279
He left because of me.

25:14.313 --> 25:18.150
I was driving him crazy.
Clinging to him.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.152
I was too needy.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.153
Mr. Monk says it was
because of him.

25:22.188 --> 25:26.157
Nah, he's just saying that
to make me feel better.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.660
It was me.

25:29.895 --> 25:32.298
It was me.

25:43.174 --> 25:44.210
(Julie)
Gilstrap.

25:44.242 --> 25:45.711
That's a funny name.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.246
Yeah. What time is it?

25:47.278 --> 25:48.615
Um, ten to 8:00.

25:48.647 --> 25:49.848
We gotta get home
after this.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.617
No. Just a couple
more houses.

25:54.353 --> 25:56.788
[knocks on door]

25:56.823 --> 25:57.957
Trick-or-treat.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.290
Trick-or-treat.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.259
Hello. We have a doctor
in the house.

26:01.292 --> 26:03.328
I'm a cardiologist.

26:03.362 --> 26:04.830
And you're
a safety boy.

26:04.864 --> 26:07.298
I'm a safety
patrol officer.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.936
Well, I think you both
look wonderful.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.806
No, thanks.
I'm allergic.

26:13.839 --> 26:14.906
To chocolate?

26:14.941 --> 26:16.107
No, ma'am.

26:16.142 --> 26:19.178
I'm allergic to food that's been
sitting in a bowl all night

26:19.211 --> 26:20.779
and that other people
have been touching.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.280
Oh, well, I love chocolate.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.215
I have to have a Neptune Bar
every night

26:24.250 --> 26:26.352
before I go to bed
or I can't sleep.

26:26.384 --> 26:29.055
Well, I guess we all have
our little quirks, don't we?

26:29.087 --> 26:31.222
I suppose we do.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.892
Well, thank you
very much.

26:32.924 --> 26:36.228
Be careful crossing
the street.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.897
I guess I don't have
to tell you that.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.905
Maybe it's fast.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.075
It's one of the most
accurate clocks in the world.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.309
I wrote the manual
for it.

26:53.244 --> 26:55.146
They'll be here.

27:02.253 --> 27:05.090
Natalie...

27:05.124 --> 27:06.959
could I ask you something?

27:06.992 --> 27:08.294
Mmm.

27:11.329 --> 27:13.732
Would you ever, uh...

27:16.234 --> 27:19.070
consider...

27:19.105 --> 27:21.773
going out with someone
like me

27:21.807 --> 27:25.778
or to be more specific, me?

27:25.811 --> 27:28.279
Of course,
we can't actually go out.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.816
I mean,
we can't go outside.

27:29.848 --> 27:32.351
But we can go
anywhere else.

27:34.820 --> 27:39.224
Thank you, Ambrose.
Thank you.

27:39.258 --> 27:42.795
But it's...
it's complicated.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.096
Okay. I understand.
Withdrawn.

27:45.131 --> 27:48.400
I never said it.
It never happened.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.802
I'll--I'll get the ice.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.337
My father likes
a lot of ice.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.339
I remember he--he used
to like clink it.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.708
Ambrose...

27:55.741 --> 27:57.809
sit down.

27:57.844 --> 28:00.179
Please.

28:09.087 --> 28:13.224
I can't go out with you
because...

28:13.259 --> 28:16.061
I work for your brother.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.431
You know,
it would just get messy.

28:19.464 --> 28:22.500
You can understand that.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.236
Yeah.

28:24.269 --> 28:27.138
But if I ever have
another job someday,

28:27.173 --> 28:29.275
I hope
you'll ask me again.

28:29.307 --> 28:32.278
Really?
Mm-hmm.

28:32.310 --> 28:35.447
So you're not saying no?

28:35.480 --> 28:38.450
That's like a...
a maybe.

28:38.483 --> 28:41.988
You're saying maybe.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.757
I'm saying maybe.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.162
Can I tell my father?

28:50.195 --> 28:55.166
That we--we might
have a date someday?

28:55.201 --> 28:57.002
Sure.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.806
I think he'd like that.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.423
Oh, my--
What is it?

29:17.455 --> 29:20.392
Did you bring
your mom's cell phone?

29:27.967 --> 29:29.300
(Stottlemeyer)
Hey, Monk.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.301
I hope that's
your costume.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.338
I'm a safety
patrol officer.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.374
Good for you.

29:35.406 --> 29:38.845
So what's so important?

29:38.877 --> 29:40.112
(Disher)
What'd they get this time?

29:40.145 --> 29:41.380
Three Musketeers.
Milky Way.

29:43.348 --> 29:44.851
It's a pigeon.

29:47.286 --> 29:51.356
Well, does he look
familiar?

29:51.390 --> 29:53.859
Does he look familiar?

29:53.893 --> 29:55.361
Take a closer look.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.829
At the murder scene,
you kept shooing it away.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.031
This is that same pigeon.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.103
Monk, you've had
a tough night.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.171
Captain,

30:05.203 --> 30:06.305
this is the same pigeon.

30:06.337 --> 30:10.209
I remember it had five
little brown spots on its back

30:10.241 --> 30:12.044
because I remember thinking
that it reminded me

30:12.077 --> 30:13.345
of the constellation
Cassiopeia.

30:13.378 --> 30:15.580
Look. You see it?
Look.

30:15.614 --> 30:16.883
Okay. Okay.

30:16.915 --> 30:19.550
You see?
Okay. It's the same pigeon.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.386
So what?
Remember?

30:21.420 --> 30:22.221
It was eating something,

30:22.253 --> 30:23.521
from right near
the victim's hand.

30:23.555 --> 30:27.526
And now, five hours later...

30:27.558 --> 30:29.528
it's dead.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.865
I think it's been poisoned.

30:32.898 --> 30:36.935
You want me to do
an autopsy on the pigeon.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.403
Yeah.

30:38.436 --> 30:39.538
Why? What would that mean?

30:39.570 --> 30:41.339
I don't know.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.474
But it would mean
something.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.011
It would be another piece
of the puzzle.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.550
Okey-dokey.

30:52.584 --> 30:55.421
Give me the pigeon.

30:56.654 --> 31:00.425
Lieutenant,
get that to the lab.

31:02.260 --> 31:03.494
[car starts]

31:03.528 --> 31:05.864
Thanks.
Happy Halloween.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.339
He's not coming.

31:48.374 --> 31:51.643
He'll be here.

31:51.676 --> 31:53.244
Why would--why would he call

31:53.278 --> 31:54.380
and not show up?

31:54.413 --> 31:56.615
Because that's what
he does.

31:56.647 --> 31:57.983
We're better off.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.117
Don't say that.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.219
[slams table]
Don't say that!

32:00.251 --> 32:01.553
We're better off!

32:01.586 --> 32:05.991
Don't you say that.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.094
Don't you dare say that.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.364
Thought you said

32:12.397 --> 32:13.432
you didn't have
any extra.

32:13.464 --> 32:16.201
I don't care.
It's my candy.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.208
You know what
your problem is?

32:22.240 --> 32:24.710
You have never learned
to wait.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.181
Never!

32:37.489 --> 32:40.159
What's going on?

32:40.192 --> 32:42.693
What are you doing?
Cleaning out his study.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.498
Oh, God,
it's so dusty.

32:46.531 --> 32:48.299
Is it?

32:55.406 --> 32:56.741
Mr. Monk.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.479
[cell phone rings]

33:02.248 --> 33:04.049
Hello.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.784
Yes, sir. Mr. Monk.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.586
It's--it's the captain.

33:07.618 --> 33:09.221
Hello!

33:09.255 --> 33:10.489
(Stottlemeyer)
You were right
about the pigeon.

33:10.521 --> 33:12.357
The bird was poisoned.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.425
I had them go back
and do a tox scan

33:14.460 --> 33:15.794
on the armored car driver.

33:15.826 --> 33:17.395
Turns out
he had been poisoned too

33:17.429 --> 33:18.297
before he was shot.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.332
The poison was called...
Tetrachlorodrine.

33:20.365 --> 33:22.201
Tetrachlorodrine.
Very deadly.

33:22.233 --> 33:23.402
Stronger than arsenic.

33:23.434 --> 33:24.702
It's stronger than arsenic.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.438
It came straight
from the lab.

33:26.471 --> 33:27.605
It hadn't even been
diluted yet.

33:27.638 --> 33:29.075
And get this.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.541
We just talked
to the plant manager here.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.078
Turns out some of the stuff
had been stolen.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.680
They didn't realize it
until today

33:34.712 --> 33:36.714
'cause they caught the guy
trying to put it back.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.384
Wait. Wait.
He was putting it back?

33:38.416 --> 33:40.118
Yeah,
they had to let him go.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.253
He denied anything and they
didn't have any evidence.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.588
The guy's name is...
Gilstrap.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.124
Gilstrap.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.393
He worked here part time
fixing computers.

33:47.425 --> 33:49.327
Gilstrap?

33:49.361 --> 33:51.529
Paul Gilstrap?

33:51.563 --> 33:55.233
Ambrose!

33:55.267 --> 33:56.402
Ambrose, don't eat
the candy!

33:56.434 --> 33:57.368
I paid for it.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.238
No, spit it out.
Spit it out.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.073
It could be poisoned?
What?

34:01.106 --> 34:02.708
That's what this whole thing
has been about.

34:02.740 --> 34:05.443
It's been spiked
with Tetrachlorodrine.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.746
Is there a Neptune Bar
in here?

34:07.778 --> 34:10.282
Not anymore there isn't.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.487
Oh, my God!
Natalie, call 9-1-1.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.655
My God!

34:17.688 --> 34:19.190
Thought it tasted funny.
Tetrachlorodrine?

34:19.224 --> 34:21.393
The guy down the street
was trying to kill his wife.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.661
It's too late.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.195
Don't say that.
Don't say that.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.431
Just get up.
Get up now.

34:25.463 --> 34:26.731
Natalie, help me.
Adrian. Adrian.

34:26.764 --> 34:30.436
Tetrachlorodrine
is a synthetic insecticide.

34:30.469 --> 34:33.371
Natalie, help me!
There is no antidote.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.576
I'll be dead
in five minutes.

34:48.219 --> 34:52.157
[alarm]

35:04.369 --> 35:05.436
Adrian.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.739
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.708
Tell me who did this.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.710
Ssh.
It doesn't matter.

35:11.742 --> 35:12.777
It matters to me.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.746
I don't want to die
without knowing.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.782
Ssh.
Tell me, Adrian.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.650
Okay.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.753
Here's what happened...

35:21.786 --> 35:26.625
His name is Paul Gilstrap.

35:26.657 --> 35:29.394
He wanted to kill his wife.

35:29.427 --> 35:34.465
He worked in a laboratory where
they made tetrachlorodrine.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.867
A few days ago,

35:35.900 --> 35:37.369
he snuck in there

35:37.402 --> 35:39.304
and he stole some of it.

35:39.338 --> 35:44.242
I met his wife when I went
trick-or-treating with Julie.

35:44.275 --> 35:46.777
And she said that she ate
a Neptune Bar

35:46.811 --> 35:49.315
every night before bed.

35:49.347 --> 35:50.949
(Ambrose)
Oh.

35:50.981 --> 35:55.521
(Monk)
Gilstrap poisoned her candy.

35:55.554 --> 35:59.257
But he couldn't poison
just one.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.659
He wanted to make it look like
there was a serial killer

36:01.693 --> 36:03.362
on the loose,

36:03.394 --> 36:05.563
so he had to poison a lot
of other candy bars.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.800
Put them back
into circulation.

36:11.769 --> 36:13.739
So his wife
would just be another victim.

36:13.771 --> 36:16.442
That's right.
It's a good plan.

36:16.474 --> 36:19.445
(Adrian)
But he made a mistake.

36:19.478 --> 36:23.681
He got caught
trying to put the poison back.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.583
(Ambrose)
Ruined everything.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.353
(Adrian)
That's right.
It ruined everything.

36:27.385 --> 36:30.556
Because now if his wife
or anyone else died

36:30.588 --> 36:34.693
from tetrachlorodrine,
they'd know it was him.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.628
So he was desperate.

36:36.661 --> 36:38.797
He had to get all
of the poisoned candy bars

36:38.829 --> 36:41.766
out of circulation.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.702
He found them all
except for two.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.271
(Ambrose)
Right.

36:45.304 --> 36:48.005
(Adrian)
The armored car driver
had one.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.275
He had already taken
a bite.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.777
If the driver dropped dead
like that,

36:52.811 --> 36:55.780
there'd be an autopsy.

36:55.813 --> 36:57.782
Gilstrap had to think fast.

36:57.815 --> 37:02.454
He grabbed the driver's gun
and shot him repeatedly.

37:02.487 --> 37:05.324
Who would bother
looking for poison

37:05.356 --> 37:08.793
in a guy who had been shot
five times?

37:10.295 --> 37:11.929
Which left
just one candy bar.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.532
The one I ate.

37:14.565 --> 37:15.434
That's right.

37:15.467 --> 37:19.871
He's been trying
to get it back all night.

37:19.905 --> 37:23.974
[alarm]

37:28.447 --> 37:30.548
How much further?
20 blocks.

37:30.581 --> 37:35.019
Adrian,
I'm sorry.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.755
I'm sorry.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.657
What are you talking about?

37:38.690 --> 37:39.958
Dad.

37:39.990 --> 37:41.659
Oh, no.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.329
I drove him away.
No.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.331
He couldn't stand me.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.664
He couldn't stand me,
Adrian.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.800
It was my fault.
No, I'm sorry.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.668
It was me.

37:50.702 --> 37:51.802
You're a good brother,
Adrian.

37:51.836 --> 37:54.773
I love you.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.842
I love you.
Don't cry, Adrian.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.409
Be strong now.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.884
That another Neptune Bar?

38:15.827 --> 38:17.596
Where's the wrapper
from the one he ate?

38:19.697 --> 38:20.998
It's right here.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.702
What?
What?

38:23.735 --> 38:27.438
This one expired
11 months ago.

38:27.472 --> 38:31.076
That must be the candy bar
left over from last year.

38:31.108 --> 38:34.679
From last Halloween?

38:34.713 --> 38:36.914
That's why it tasted funny.

38:36.947 --> 38:42.420
That's why
it tasted funny.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.422
So this--this is the--

38:44.456 --> 38:46.724
this is the poison.

38:46.757 --> 38:48.626
That's why
it tasted funny.

38:48.659 --> 38:51.963
[laughter]

38:51.996 --> 38:54.500
That's why
it tasted funny!

38:54.532 --> 38:58.769
[laughter]

38:58.804 --> 39:01.407
This is the--

39:01.440 --> 39:03.375
This is the one
with poison.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.543
[laughs]

39:05.577 --> 39:06.978
I had a stomachache.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.653
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.389
Everyone got so upset.

39:31.869 --> 39:32.971
(Disher)
Paul Gilstrap.

39:36.807 --> 39:37.775
(Stottlemeyer)
Boo.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.710
You missed one.

40:08.606 --> 40:10.742
Ambrose, about our date.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.577
Is Friday okay?

40:12.610 --> 40:14.579
No, Natalie.
That's okay.

40:14.612 --> 40:18.215
You--you don't have to.
You thought I was dying.

40:18.248 --> 40:21.052
I'll be here Friday.

40:24.121 --> 40:26.123
Hey, look.
There's a note.

40:39.003 --> 40:42.940
"Stopped by. Nobody home.

40:42.974 --> 40:46.512
"Can't blame you.
I wouldn't wait for me either.

40:49.847 --> 40:50.949
"Dad.

40:50.981 --> 40:53.818
"P.S.

40:53.851 --> 40:58.255
Ambrose, I'm proud of you
for getting out of the house."

40:58.289 --> 41:03.862
He said
he was proud of me?

41:15.072 --> 41:16.775
You think he'll be back?

41:19.610 --> 41:22.047
I don't know.

41:22.079 --> 41:25.250
I think he'll be back.

41:27.284 --> 41:30.288
Maybe we should, uh,

41:30.320 --> 41:34.559
go inside.

41:34.592 --> 41:35.760
Let's go inside.

41:35.793 --> 41:38.096
It's better...

41:38.128 --> 41:42.266
inside.

41:42.300 --> 41:45.804
Excuse me.

42:04.655 --> 42:07.659
