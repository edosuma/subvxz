WEBVTT

00:02.999 --> 00:03.201
Hey, baby.

00:03.234 --> 00:05.203
Hey. How was Tony's
birthday party?

00:05.237 --> 00:07.339
Well, it was a lot better
than last year.

00:07.373 --> 00:09.509
The stripper had all her teeth
and no one got arrested.

00:11.377 --> 00:12.745
That's nice.

00:12.778 --> 00:14.614
Hey, did you know
that estrogen

00:14.647 --> 00:16.516
increases blood flow
to the uterus,

00:16.548 --> 00:19.251
thereby helping the lining
to thicken and expand?

00:21.253 --> 00:23.088
Honey, if this is
your idea of foreplay,

00:23.121 --> 00:24.757
it's very technical.

00:25.557 --> 00:27.492
But I can work with it.

00:27.525 --> 00:29.562
Oh, what's that smell?

00:29.594 --> 00:32.531
What?

00:29.594 --> 00:32.531
You had cigars
and beer.

00:32.564 --> 00:35.100
Ah! And Polish sausage
with kraut.

00:36.402 --> 00:39.439
So what?
You smell like books.

00:39.472 --> 00:42.642
Honey, you know
we're trying
to get pregnant.

00:42.674 --> 00:44.342
I mean, remember
what the doctor said

00:44.375 --> 00:45.378
about trying
to raise your
sperm count?

00:45.411 --> 00:46.646
No drinking,
no smoking.

00:46.679 --> 00:48.381
I know, but you know,
it's not every day

00:48.414 --> 00:50.850
Tony turns 47.

00:50.883 --> 00:52.819
Come on, it was
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

00:52.851 --> 00:54.653
Oh, yeah?
What about last week
when you came home from work

00:54.686 --> 00:56.121
smelling like cigars?

00:56.155 --> 00:57.657
I thought that was
a once-in-a-lifetime
thing.

00:57.689 --> 00:59.826
Cheryl, a guy on my crew
had a baby.

00:59.859 --> 01:02.228
It was either smoke the cigar
or buy him a present.

01:04.162 --> 01:06.531
Okay, okay,
what about the hot tub?

01:06.564 --> 01:07.867
I don't know.
I'm not in the mood.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.403
Frankly, I don't like
your tone.

01:10.436 --> 01:12.605
No! You're sitting
in there every night

01:12.638 --> 01:15.541
cooking your swimmers.

01:15.573 --> 01:17.343
Cheryl, look at me.
Do I have wings?

01:18.444 --> 01:19.579
I'm not a saint.

01:19.611 --> 01:22.814
I'm not perfect.
I have flaws.

01:22.847 --> 01:24.450
Are you waiting
for me to disagree?

01:25.718 --> 01:26.719
Would it
kill you?

01:28.554 --> 01:30.756
Honey,
I know it's not easy,

01:30.789 --> 01:31.957
but if we're gonna have
another baby,

01:31.989 --> 01:33.759
you're gonna have
to give up some
of the things you like.

01:33.792 --> 01:34.826
(SIGHS)

01:34.859 --> 01:36.462
I thought we were
in agreement.

01:36.495 --> 01:38.364
I thought you were
gonna commit to this.

01:38.397 --> 01:40.700
All right,
fine.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.435
No more smoking,
no more drinking,

01:42.468 --> 01:45.737
no more hot-tubbing,
no more fun whatsoever
of any kind.

01:47.506 --> 01:49.808
Aw, honey,
we can still have fun.

01:49.841 --> 01:51.810
Come on. Come on.

01:52.878 --> 01:54.680
(CHUCKLING)

01:54.712 --> 01:56.681
No, after
you brush your teeth
and take a shower.

01:56.715 --> 01:59.519
Fine. But just remember,
if it wasn't for liquor,

01:59.552 --> 02:01.754
we wouldn't have
two of the three kids.

02:09.328 --> 02:10.729
JIM: <i> Oh, baby!</i>

02:12.764 --> 02:14.266
(EXCLAIMING)

02:14.300 --> 02:15.835
Hey, you
know what?

02:15.867 --> 02:18.336
You carry your
own golf clubs
and you walk,

02:18.370 --> 02:20.573
golf is almost
like exercise.

02:20.605 --> 02:22.375
Hey, Jim,
you want a beer?

02:22.407 --> 02:24.576
Ah, no, thanks.

02:24.610 --> 02:25.678
What?

02:25.711 --> 02:27.747
Yeah, Jim's on
a big health kick.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.348
He can't
have a beer
because...

02:29.381 --> 02:31.616
Because
if I drink,

02:31.650 --> 02:34.353
I may accidentally
wrap this club
around your neck!

02:34.385 --> 02:36.389
Oh, right.
Mum's the word.

02:38.790 --> 02:39.859
Hey, Jim,
you're up.

02:39.891 --> 02:41.359
And make
it quick.

02:41.393 --> 02:43.663
My wife's having surgery
in 30 minutes.

02:45.230 --> 02:46.365
It's elective.

02:49.668 --> 02:50.569
Good luck,
pally.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.872
I'm having a good day.
I'm having a good day.

02:55.674 --> 02:56.776
MAN: Sweet.

02:56.808 --> 02:58.644
Man, look
at her go.

02:58.676 --> 03:00.812
Be right,
baby. Come on.

03:00.846 --> 03:02.282
Oh!

03:00.846 --> 03:02.282
Hey, that's
on the green.

03:03.282 --> 03:04.284
It's still
going!

03:03.282 --> 03:04.284
Wow!

03:04.949 --> 03:07.252
(ALL SCREAMING)

03:07.286 --> 03:08.987
A hole in one!

03:09.020 --> 03:10.655
MAN: Oh, my God!

03:10.688 --> 03:13.592
A hole in one!
A hole in one!

03:13.626 --> 03:14.961
A hole in one!
A hole in one!

03:14.993 --> 03:17.597
Hey, hey.
Hole in one!

03:19.465 --> 03:20.932
<i>♪ I'm the king of the road</i>

03:20.966 --> 03:22.868
<i>♪ A Coupe de Ville
is my throne</i>

03:24.870 --> 03:26.938
<i>♪ As long as I get the ball</i>

03:26.972 --> 03:28.540
<i> ♪ It is going, going</i>

03:28.574 --> 03:30.977
<i> ♪ Going in the hole ♪</i>

03:31.009 --> 03:34.312
(ALL LAUGHING)

03:34.346 --> 03:36.949
Hey, hey, who's
the one that hit
the hole in one?

03:36.981 --> 03:38.283
Oh, let me see.

03:38.317 --> 03:39.685
Uh... You didn't.

03:38.317 --> 03:39.685
Nope.

03:39.717 --> 03:41.519
You didn't.
And you didn't.

03:41.552 --> 03:42.687
Must have been
little ol' me!

03:42.721 --> 03:44.590
(LAUGHING)

03:44.622 --> 03:45.790
All right,
you want
my autograph?

03:45.824 --> 03:47.260
Actually, no.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.828
My manager sent
me in here
to tell you

03:48.860 --> 03:49.995
to put
your trunks
back on.

03:50.028 --> 03:51.396
Oh...

03:52.865 --> 03:54.700
Well, that ship
has sailed,
my friend.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.701
(ALL LAUGHING)

03:56.735 --> 03:58.838
People, we are
in the presence
of greatness.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.039
Yes!

04:00.072 --> 04:03.009
Yes, sir, I feel honored
to soak in your filth.

04:03.741 --> 04:05.510
To Jim!

04:03.741 --> 04:05.510
ALL: To Jim!

04:11.516 --> 04:13.019
Oh...

04:13.051 --> 04:16.555
Man, I partied
way too hard
last night.

04:16.588 --> 04:19.725
My head feels
like you sat on it.

04:19.757 --> 04:23.495
Oh, like you sitting on my
head would be such a
sweet summer breeze.

04:25.497 --> 04:27.932
Hey, girls.
Have fun at school.

04:27.966 --> 04:30.502
Daddy, I don't want
to go to school.
I want to stay home.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.905
Yeah, we want
to play all day
like Mommy.

04:32.937 --> 04:34.740
Hey!

04:34.773 --> 04:37.877
Mommy does not
stay at home
and play all day.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.712
Sometimes she
goes to the mall.

04:39.745 --> 04:41.314
Oh...

04:41.346 --> 04:42.614
Come here, girls.
Give me a kiss.

04:42.648 --> 04:43.915
Andy, would you
do me a favor

04:43.949 --> 04:45.651
and put the kids
in the car?
I'll be right out.

04:45.684 --> 04:47.887
No problem.
Hey, buddy.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.355
So, what are you
gonna do all day,
little guy?

04:50.389 --> 04:52.358
Eat ice cream
and take a nap.

04:52.391 --> 04:54.727
Oh, man,
you are livin'
the dream.

04:57.829 --> 05:00.365
Honey,
here's your
sample cup.

05:03.067 --> 05:04.971
For the lab.
It's the second
Monday of the month.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.942
Right.
Sample cup.

05:10.942 --> 05:12.377
Finally.

05:12.411 --> 05:13.978
Yeah, I know.

05:14.012 --> 05:16.716
So just, you know,
do your thing,
drop it off at the lab,

05:16.749 --> 05:18.651
and I'll get
the results
this afternoon.

05:19.084 --> 05:20.485
Oh! Honey,

05:20.519 --> 05:21.987
I feel so good about this.

05:22.019 --> 05:24.356
I mean, you've been
so good these
past couple weeks,

05:24.389 --> 05:26.658
and the doctor said
if you stayed away
from all that bad stuff...

05:26.692 --> 05:27.994
Which I did.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.930
...which you did,

05:30.963 --> 05:32.730
that your count
should really
be up this time.

05:36.802 --> 05:38.838
Cheryl, does it have
to be today?

05:38.870 --> 05:40.906
Yeah, why?

05:40.939 --> 05:45.411
Well, I'm feeling
a little bloated,
and...

05:45.444 --> 05:48.547
I just don't find
myself very
attractive right now.

05:48.579 --> 05:52.752
God, are you nuts?
You are beautiful.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.721
In fact,
have you
lost weight?

05:56.954 --> 05:58.056
Really?

05:58.089 --> 05:59.091
Fill the cup.

06:00.793 --> 06:04.430
Cheryl, I don't know.
I mean, I'm not
a machine.

06:04.463 --> 06:06.466
I can't just perform
at the drop of a hat.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.999
Since when?

06:10.836 --> 06:11.804
Jim, just go out
to the garage

06:11.836 --> 06:13.872
and stare at
that tramp on
your tool calendar.

06:16.108 --> 06:18.511
That tramp
has a name,
Cheryl.

06:19.511 --> 06:20.546
Her name
is Misty.

06:21.012 --> 06:22.714
I see.

06:22.747 --> 06:24.916
Well, try not
to call out my name
when you're with her.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.853
Even tramps
hate that.

06:27.485 --> 06:28.687
Love you.

06:31.189 --> 06:32.492
Crap!

06:34.526 --> 06:36.829
Okay, kids
are in the car.

06:36.862 --> 06:39.632
Any other
demeaning job
I can do for you?

06:41.000 --> 06:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:49.908 --> 06:51.444
You know, Andy,
there is one thing.

06:54.045 --> 06:55.680
What do you think
about that girl

06:55.713 --> 06:58.016
on that tool calendar
in the garage?

06:58.884 --> 07:00.019
Misty?

07:00.786 --> 07:03.588
Oh, she's fantastic.

07:03.622 --> 07:07.026
I don't know, there's
something about a gal in a
bikini holding a belt sander.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.595
Mmm-hmm.

07:09.627 --> 07:11.798
She sure could smooth
my rough edges.

07:14.165 --> 07:15.701
Hey...

07:15.733 --> 07:17.637
Why don't you let her?

07:18.237 --> 07:19.504
Huh?

07:19.538 --> 07:21.473
Why don't you
go in the garage,

07:21.507 --> 07:22.942
let your mind wander
a little bit,

07:22.975 --> 07:25.177
and let nature
take its course?

07:26.677 --> 07:29.247
What the hell
are you saying?

07:29.281 --> 07:32.117
I'm saying, you know,
life is short.

07:33.151 --> 07:35.621
Treat yourself.
Have a little fun.

07:37.956 --> 07:39.725
You want me
to go in your
garage and...

07:39.757 --> 07:41.259
Yeah,
you know,

07:41.293 --> 07:43.663
badger the witness
a little, you know.

07:45.297 --> 07:46.765
What's this?

07:46.798 --> 07:49.968
Oh, yeah,
and, you know,
while you're doing it,

07:50.002 --> 07:51.704
maybe you could
put it in this
little cup for me.

07:54.172 --> 07:56.075
It's for the
fertility doctor.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.610
Oh, God.
That's sick.
No way!

07:58.644 --> 08:00.946
Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy.
Come here, come here.

08:00.978 --> 08:02.781
You know, after
all that partying
we did yesterday,

08:02.814 --> 08:04.917
I'm afraid
my count's gonna
be really low.

08:04.949 --> 08:05.950
I need your
help here.

08:05.983 --> 08:08.086
Okay, Jim,
you're my brother-in-law

08:08.120 --> 08:09.822
and my friend,
but I'm gonna tell you

08:09.855 --> 08:11.891
the same thing I told
Mike Franks in ninth grade.

08:11.923 --> 08:13.558
Do your own
homework.

08:13.591 --> 08:14.894
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

08:14.927 --> 08:17.963
Come on, come on.
Andy, listen,

08:17.995 --> 08:20.198
I just need
a little time for
my body to recover.

08:20.232 --> 08:22.034
I'd do it
for you.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.701
The fact
that you're
even offering

08:23.735 --> 08:25.971
raises a lot
of red flags.

08:26.004 --> 08:28.974
Andy, look,
I could easily go down
to the bus depot

08:29.007 --> 08:31.110
and get a runaway
to do it for a sandwich.

08:32.344 --> 08:33.778
But no,

08:33.812 --> 08:36.081
I want
to honor you,
my best friend,

08:37.215 --> 08:38.551
with this
opportunity.

08:38.582 --> 08:41.620
Jim, I'm not saying
I'm not flattered.

08:42.888 --> 08:44.657
I'm just completely
weirded out.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.125
Andy, Andy!

08:46.158 --> 08:48.826
Bottom line...
You give it to me,

08:48.860 --> 08:50.229
or I take it!

09:00.605 --> 09:02.073
Go ahead.

09:08.245 --> 09:09.915
All right,
you called my bluff.

09:11.783 --> 09:13.085
All right,
what's it gonna take?

09:13.118 --> 09:15.621
Uh, let me think here.
Uh...

09:15.653 --> 09:17.856
Get in Cheryl's nightgown,
run down to the Post Office.

09:19.791 --> 09:21.260
Absolutely not!

09:21.293 --> 09:22.894
Well, then great!
Let's go to work.

09:22.927 --> 09:24.629
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

09:24.663 --> 09:26.331
To the end
of the block.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.067
Around the block.

09:29.999 --> 09:30.602
With lipstick.

09:32.837 --> 09:34.072
Lip balm.

09:35.106 --> 09:36.140
Tinted gloss.

09:36.173 --> 09:37.242
Deal.

09:40.678 --> 09:42.347
You, uh...

09:42.380 --> 09:43.682
You may want
to leave the house.

09:43.715 --> 09:45.685
I'm a bit of a screamer.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.065
Okay, I'm not
seeing any wives,
any kids.

10:00.097 --> 10:02.168
He skis,
and he's cute.

10:03.802 --> 10:05.336
I can't believe
you ditched work

10:05.370 --> 10:08.340
just to cruise
my fertility doctor.

10:05.370 --> 10:08.340
Oh!

10:08.373 --> 10:11.076
Cheryl, I am here to give
you emotional support...

10:11.109 --> 10:13.245
Ooh, appointment book.

10:14.379 --> 10:16.949
Hey, he's free
Saturday night.

10:16.981 --> 10:18.082
That's good.

10:18.115 --> 10:20.119
Sunday brunch with Mom.

10:20.152 --> 10:21.320
That's sweet.

10:21.352 --> 10:22.954
Mmm.

10:22.988 --> 10:23.990
In moderation.

10:25.456 --> 10:26.991
Oh! Look at this,
look!

10:27.024 --> 10:28.793
CHERYL: Aww.

10:27.024 --> 10:28.793
Ooh!

10:28.826 --> 10:30.663
(DOOR OPENS)

10:30.696 --> 10:32.297
Hey, Dr. Murphy!

10:30.696 --> 10:32.297
Hi, Cheryl.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.734
This is my sister Dana.

10:35.767 --> 10:37.236
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

10:37.269 --> 10:38.971
Nice to meet you.

10:39.004 --> 10:41.740
I'm just here
supporting my sister.

10:41.773 --> 10:43.808
Canceled a big ski trip
to be here.

10:44.408 --> 10:47.312
Oh, how I love to ski.

10:47.345 --> 10:51.050
Ski, ski, ski, ski, ski.

10:51.082 --> 10:53.752
Anyway, Dr. Murphy,
I brought you
some more cookies.

10:54.985 --> 10:56.154
Cheryl,
that is very sweet.

10:56.187 --> 10:57.389
I think
I told you
that cookies

10:57.422 --> 10:59.892
will not affect
the results
of Jim's test.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.729
I know you have
to say that.

11:03.761 --> 11:05.664
Just see what
you can do.

11:07.732 --> 11:09.200
All right, well,
I do have the results

11:09.234 --> 11:10.903
from that sample
that Jim dropped off
earlier.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.971
I put some
extra chips
in there, so...

11:15.173 --> 11:16.808
Okay, go ahead.

11:18.043 --> 11:19.845
Okay, well, uh,

11:19.878 --> 11:21.714
Jim's count
is off the charts.

11:21.746 --> 11:24.248
Oh! You see?
You see?

11:24.282 --> 11:27.186
That's because he's been
following your regimen.

11:27.219 --> 11:29.121
It's so far
off the charts,
in fact,

11:29.153 --> 11:30.755
that I was
concerned,

11:30.788 --> 11:33.259
so I had
the lab run
some extra tests.

11:35.860 --> 11:36.894
Oh, God. Hand.

11:36.927 --> 11:38.362
Hand!

11:38.395 --> 11:40.298
Go ahead, Cheryl. Squeeze
as hard as you want.

11:40.331 --> 11:42.333
It's not gonna hurt, because
there's no wedding ring.

11:42.366 --> 11:44.069
(MOUTHING) Ow! Ow!

11:46.203 --> 11:48.272
Cheryl, there's, uh...

11:48.306 --> 11:50.475
There's no good way
to say this.

11:51.176 --> 11:52.478
What?

11:52.510 --> 11:55.714
Is it possible that you
and Jim are somehow...

11:56.081 --> 11:57.283
Related?

12:06.024 --> 12:08.927
No! Of course not.
What are you talking about?

12:08.960 --> 12:10.929
Well, what I mean is,
do you and Jim

12:10.961 --> 12:12.364
share a parent?

12:15.933 --> 12:16.935
Or two?

12:18.803 --> 12:21.038
What?
No, no, of course...

12:21.072 --> 12:23.109
Jim and I are not related!

12:23.942 --> 12:25.510
Well,

12:25.543 --> 12:27.211
according to
these test results,

12:27.245 --> 12:29.981
you and Jim share
50% of the same DNA.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.152
Which would make you
brother and sister.

12:36.086 --> 12:37.221
Oh!

12:37.254 --> 12:39.491
Oh! No, no, no, no.

12:40.357 --> 12:41.526
Your tests are wrong.

12:41.559 --> 12:44.028
That's impossible.
Jim and I are not related.

12:44.062 --> 12:46.230
Yeah, yeah, because then
Jim and I would be related,

12:46.264 --> 12:47.466
and I cannot allow that.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.802
It's bad enough I have
to cop to Andy.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.837
Oh...
Andy's our brother.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.472
Our only brother.

12:56.441 --> 12:57.843
Is it possible

12:57.875 --> 12:59.477
that somehow
I tested his sample

12:59.510 --> 13:01.514
instead
of your husband's?

13:06.083 --> 13:09.053
With Jim,
anything's possible.

13:09.086 --> 13:11.490
No, no, no.
That's insane.

13:11.523 --> 13:13.591
Why would Jim
have Andy's sample?

13:13.625 --> 13:15.994
Why would Andy
be giving
out samples?

13:16.027 --> 13:18.030
What the hell
do those two
do all day?

13:26.037 --> 13:27.339
Come on,
I got the
chicken wings.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.873
Oh, hey,
all right.

13:28.907 --> 13:30.843
So, how's tomorrow
look for you?

13:30.875 --> 13:32.009
For what?

13:32.043 --> 13:32.977
You know,
get in Cheryl's
nightgown

13:33.010 --> 13:35.146
and run
around the block.

13:35.179 --> 13:37.448
Oh, yeah, that.
That's not happening.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.919
Hey!
We had a deal.

13:40.951 --> 13:42.321
Well, you just
learned your
first lesson

13:42.354 --> 13:43.422
in the sex trade...

13:43.455 --> 13:44.456
Get paid up front.

13:46.191 --> 13:48.160
But, Andy,
I do want
to thank you.

13:48.192 --> 13:50.129
Oh, it was
my pleasure.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.600
Really.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.600
Yeah, okay.

13:56.333 --> 13:59.337
Hey!

13:56.333 --> 13:59.337
Oh, hey!
How are you?

13:59.370 --> 14:00.972
How you doing?
How did it go?

14:01.005 --> 14:04.409
It went great.
Your count is
through the roof.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.646
Yes!

14:07.678 --> 14:09.514
Yeah,
thank you, Andy,
for helping me

14:09.547 --> 14:10.983
with all that
clean living
and stuff.

14:11.015 --> 14:12.183
CHERYL: Thank you.

14:12.216 --> 14:13.885
I mean,
your sacrifices
really paid off.

14:13.918 --> 14:14.886
Oh, it's true.

14:14.919 --> 14:18.189
Dr. Murphy even
used the phrase
"super sperm."

14:18.222 --> 14:20.458
Whoo! I'm
getting myself
a vanity plate.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.930
I mean,
how great
for Jim,

14:24.962 --> 14:28.099
whose seed is
so unbelievably
awesome.

14:30.501 --> 14:32.203
And do you
want to hear
the best news?

14:32.236 --> 14:34.338
What could
be better than
hearing that someone

14:34.371 --> 14:36.975
in this family
is intensely
fertile?

14:38.442 --> 14:41.612
Well, because
your count
was so high,

14:41.645 --> 14:43.481
and I'm in
my ovulation
window,

14:43.514 --> 14:45.449
they went ahead
and artificially
inseminated me

14:45.482 --> 14:46.985
right there!

14:55.192 --> 14:56.895
CHERYL: Isn't that great?

15:00.230 --> 15:02.000
I mean, honey,
that's so great!

15:02.033 --> 15:04.370
And you know,
I just know
it took.

15:07.471 --> 15:10.074
A woman knows
these things.

15:07.471 --> 15:10.074
Mmm-hmm.

15:10.107 --> 15:11.375
You know,
I hope this one
looks like

15:11.408 --> 15:12.677
our side
of the family.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.013
Oh...

15:16.081 --> 15:17.481
So do I.
So do I.

15:17.514 --> 15:20.217
You know,
if it's a boy,

15:17.514 --> 15:20.217
JIM: Uh-huh?

15:20.250 --> 15:21.252
I want to
name him Andy.

15:21.285 --> 15:22.420
Oh...

15:24.022 --> 15:25.391
Oh, dear God!

15:28.192 --> 15:29.461
(VOMITS)

15:31.028 --> 15:32.663
Cheryl, Cheryl, Cheryl,

15:32.697 --> 15:35.133
you know what?
I wish you would have
checked with me!

15:35.166 --> 15:37.035
Well, I wanted
to surprise you.

15:37.067 --> 15:38.669
Oh, he looks
surprised to me,
Cheryl.

15:38.702 --> 15:39.737
You're
surprised,
right?

15:39.770 --> 15:41.139
Yes,
I am.

15:41.172 --> 15:43.041
Honey, go on,
have a drink.

15:43.073 --> 15:45.576
Drink, smoke,
go nuts!
Because, baby,

15:45.610 --> 15:47.079
your work
is done.

15:47.111 --> 15:48.279
No!

15:48.312 --> 15:49.380
Cheryl,
this is...

15:49.413 --> 15:50.682
This is
not good.

15:50.715 --> 15:52.149
Actually,
this is bad.

15:52.182 --> 15:54.686
This is actually
the kind of Bible bad...

15:54.719 --> 15:56.655
In the Bible bad.

15:56.687 --> 15:59.323
Cheryl, I think
I've gone too far
this time.

15:59.356 --> 16:00.658
You think!

16:02.626 --> 16:05.229
Well, no, honey,
I don't understand.

16:05.263 --> 16:07.699
Baby, this is
the miracle
of life,

16:07.731 --> 16:09.767
and it's
growing
inside me.

16:09.801 --> 16:12.170
No!

16:12.202 --> 16:14.105
Cheryl, it's not
the miracle of life!

16:14.139 --> 16:17.109
That's your brother's freaky
mutant kid in there!

16:19.744 --> 16:22.114
We're all going to hell!

16:23.148 --> 16:24.582
Cheryl...

16:24.615 --> 16:26.451
Well, how
could that be?

16:26.484 --> 16:28.754
Unless you
dropped off
Andy's sample

16:28.787 --> 16:31.089
instead of
your own!

16:31.121 --> 16:33.458
You knew that
and you did it anyway?

16:35.125 --> 16:36.794
Cheryl,
you don't understand!

16:36.827 --> 16:40.164
Yes, Jim, she is
going to have
Andy's baby

16:40.197 --> 16:41.667
just to
teach you
a lesson.

16:44.235 --> 16:45.770
Okay, so...

16:45.803 --> 16:49.473
There was no insemination
whatsoever, right?

16:49.506 --> 16:52.076
Here's a sentence
I never thought
I'd have to say.

16:52.110 --> 16:54.446
I am not
having my
brother's baby.

16:56.648 --> 17:00.552
Sis, I just
want you to know
if it had been true,

17:00.585 --> 17:03.088
I would have done
the right thing
by you.

17:03.822 --> 17:06.223
Get out! Get out!
Go, go!

17:06.257 --> 17:08.626
That was some
good, clean fun.

17:10.161 --> 17:11.229
Come on,
let's go
get dinner.

17:11.261 --> 17:13.597
Oh, what a day.

17:13.631 --> 17:15.700
I thought I sired
my own nephew.

17:15.732 --> 17:18.102
I threw up
on the porch,

17:18.135 --> 17:20.271
and I loved myself
on Jim's riding mower.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.542
Where have you not
loved yourself?

17:28.680 --> 17:29.782
Ahem.

17:33.518 --> 17:35.386
All right, Cheryl,

17:35.420 --> 17:36.488
I forgive you.

17:38.789 --> 17:39.724
What?

17:39.758 --> 17:43.295
Well, you almost gave me
a heart attack there.

17:43.327 --> 17:44.528
Jim!

17:44.561 --> 17:47.365
You cheated
on a fertility test!

17:47.397 --> 17:49.266
Come on, you act
like I'm the only guy
in the world

17:49.299 --> 17:51.403
who's ever done that.

17:51.435 --> 17:53.237
What is going on
in that knot

17:53.270 --> 17:54.772
that keeps
your spine
from falling apart?

17:54.806 --> 17:56.740
Cheryl...

17:56.773 --> 18:00.744
Cheryl, when I went
golfing yesterday,

18:00.778 --> 18:02.547
I hit a hole in one,
all right?

18:02.579 --> 18:04.816
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
thing, baby.

18:04.848 --> 18:07.519
I mean, come on.
I had to celebrate.

18:07.551 --> 18:09.620
Any guy
would have
celebrated.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.156
Any guy is not
trying to have
a baby with me!

18:12.190 --> 18:13.557
Uh, Cheryl...

18:13.590 --> 18:15.193
Jim...

18:13.590 --> 18:15.193
Well, I...

18:17.662 --> 18:18.663
Jim...

18:19.597 --> 18:21.732
Are you serious
about having
another baby?

18:21.766 --> 18:24.369
What? Of course I am.

18:24.402 --> 18:25.569
Then why do you keep
doing things

18:25.603 --> 18:26.805
that might keep it
from happening?

18:26.837 --> 18:28.706
I'm not.

18:26.837 --> 18:28.706
You are.
You're sabotaging,

18:28.740 --> 18:29.907
and I want
to know why.

18:29.941 --> 18:32.544
Oh, come on. Okay,
let's analyze Jim now.

18:32.576 --> 18:34.378
What would Dr. Phil say?

18:34.412 --> 18:36.882
(IMITATING DR. PHIL)
"Well, Jim, it seems like

18:36.914 --> 18:38.916
"your father didn't
hug you enough.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.153
"That's why you love cigars!"

18:43.520 --> 18:45.423
I'm serious.

18:45.455 --> 18:47.725
Come on, is it because
of the doctors

18:47.759 --> 18:49.260
and the cups and all
that technical stuff?

18:49.294 --> 18:50.862
No!

18:49.294 --> 18:50.862
Is it money?

18:50.894 --> 18:52.463
Are you afraid of
having another mouth
to feed?

18:52.497 --> 18:54.733
No, no, no. Will you
back off a little bit?

18:55.633 --> 18:56.634
Is it me?

18:56.667 --> 18:57.868
No, it's not...

18:56.667 --> 18:57.868
Then what is it?

18:57.902 --> 18:59.238
What if it doesn't work?

19:01.405 --> 19:03.207
Is that it?

19:03.240 --> 19:04.808
I don't know.

19:04.842 --> 19:07.913
Well, is that
what you're afraid of?

19:10.214 --> 19:11.916
I'm not afraid, Cheryl.

19:13.550 --> 19:15.787
But if I were,
that would be it.

19:18.388 --> 19:21.458
Are you worried that
you might do
everything right

19:21.491 --> 19:23.761
and your count
will still be low?

19:25.762 --> 19:27.532
(MUMBLES)

19:28.967 --> 19:30.769
Do you think that,

19:30.801 --> 19:33.838
like, as a man,
it's your job
to get me pregnant?

19:35.272 --> 19:36.541
(MUMBLES)

19:39.309 --> 19:41.445
And what if I don't
get pregnant, huh?

19:41.479 --> 19:42.514
Mmm.

19:44.281 --> 19:45.383
Honey.

19:45.415 --> 19:46.617
What?

19:46.651 --> 19:48.452
Honey!

19:48.486 --> 19:51.456
If I don't get pregnant,
then I still have you

19:51.489 --> 19:53.225
and the three
beautiful kids

19:53.258 --> 19:55.427
that you
have already
given me.

19:56.928 --> 19:58.597
Honey...

19:58.630 --> 20:02.401
Come on, another baby...
It's just like a bonus.

20:05.636 --> 20:06.671
Really?

20:06.703 --> 20:07.873
Really.

20:09.874 --> 20:11.476
Really really?

20:12.309 --> 20:13.412
Eh...

20:14.612 --> 20:16.514
(LAUGHING)

20:16.547 --> 20:18.482
Oh, Cheryl,
you're the best.

20:16.547 --> 20:18.482
Oh, honey.

20:20.384 --> 20:22.420
(SIGHS)

20:22.452 --> 20:23.821
I don't know
how I found you.

20:26.657 --> 20:27.825
You know what
the worst part is?

20:27.858 --> 20:29.026
Hmm?

20:29.059 --> 20:31.963
I didn't get to tell you
about my hole in one.

20:37.468 --> 20:40.772
So, you think
that's the
worst part?

20:42.406 --> 20:43.442
(LAUGHS)

20:43.974 --> 20:45.009
No.

20:46.943 --> 20:48.312
(LAUGHING)

20:48.346 --> 20:49.480
So you're really
ovulating?

20:49.513 --> 20:50.681
Yeah.

20:50.714 --> 20:51.916
And it's
my own egg.

20:53.550 --> 20:56.020
Show-off.

20:53.550 --> 20:56.020
I know.

20:56.054 --> 20:58.556
Hey, you want
to go upstairs?

20:56.054 --> 20:58.556
Sure.

20:58.588 --> 20:59.691
Yeah?

20:58.588 --> 20:59.691
Yeah.

20:59.723 --> 21:00.991
Hey, you want
to put on a bikini

21:01.025 --> 21:02.861
and hold
a belt sander?

21:04.528 --> 21:06.565
And the foreplay
begins.
