WEBVTT

00:01.340 --> 00:03.400
Do you know what she looks like?

00:03.469 --> 00:05.370
Of course I know what she looks like.

00:05.390 --> 00:06.630
I wouldn't be much of a psychic

00:06.650 --> 00:09.970
if I didn't know what the girl of your dreams looks like.

00:11.930 --> 00:17.930
She's blonde,athletic and very flexible.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.620
Really? I'm not usually attract to the athletic type.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.370
Well,I don't know what to tell you.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.610
I'm just the conduit.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.500
This is the universe talking and the universe has told me

00:27.530 --> 00:30.700
that you are going to meet a girl.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.940
Oh,tough luck there,sport,your ten minutes are up.

00:33.980 --> 00:37.740
Why don't you go see if you can borrow your mom's credit card

00:37.780 --> 00:39.590
and give me a call back,okay?

00:39.610 --> 00:40.800
Sure thing,Michael.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.010
I'm on my break.

01:05.030 --> 01:06.370
What are you talking about a break?

01:06.390 --> 01:08.660
You're not working at the mall,there is no break.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.780
I'm on my break,man.

01:11.380 --> 01:13.450
Listen,there are laws,okay?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.740
Well,it's one of your regulars.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.920
You want me to put it through to someone else,I will.

01:17.950 --> 01:20.480
Hit me,baby,one more time.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.720
Hello,and thank you for calling PSYLINE.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.670
Your personal phone psychic is on

01:26.690 --> 01:30.650
and ready to open the portals to the psychic universe.

01:30.710 --> 01:32.650
Michael,is that you?

01:32.670 --> 01:34.400
Thank God. It's Tanya King.

01:34.430 --> 01:37.400
Ms. King!How was Paris?

01:37.510 --> 01:39.180
Oh,Michael...

01:39.210 --> 01:41.950
Michael,Michael,Michael.

01:41.970 --> 01:44.270
Ms. King,you can call me crazy

01:44.290 --> 01:46.520
but I'm sensing some bad energy here.

01:46.530 --> 01:48.050
Has something happened?

01:48.070 --> 01:50.200
It's... it's Gregory.

01:50.230 --> 01:51.800
I've lost him.

01:51.900 --> 01:52.830
You're kidding!

01:52.850 --> 01:54.350
Thought he was kind of big for that.

01:54.370 --> 01:56.340
He's dead,Michael.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.400
He's been murdered.

01:59.580 --> 02:01.600
Oh,Michael.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.700
Well,that's not good.

02:14.780 --> 02:15.950
Hello.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.800
Hey,it's me.Sorry to wake you,but I got a problem.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.200
Maybe you could walk me through it.

02:20.220 --> 02:21.980
Well,I'll try.What's going on?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.110
I'm here at a crime scene--robbery gone bad.

02:24.130 --> 02:25.910
Man of the house surprised an intruder.

02:25.930 --> 02:28.000
Got his head bashed in for his trouble.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.740
Wife comes home from a trip to Paris

02:29.760 --> 02:31.970
and finds him dead in the living room.

02:33.230 --> 02:35.070
Did you say Paris?

02:35.090 --> 02:36.140
Yeah,but that's not important.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.630
Here's where I need your help.

02:37.650 --> 02:38.800
She locked herself in her bedroom.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.040
Apparently she's talking on the phone with her own personal psychic.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.830
What do you think?

02:43.850 --> 02:47.380
I think I'm... on my way over.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.120
By the looks of it,then intruder encounters Mr. King somewhere in this room.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.850
They fought,worked their way towards the fireplace.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.090
The intruder grabbed that poker and struck Mr. King repeatedly.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.090
Somewhere in all that,he hit his head on that marble ledge--broke his neck.

03:50.510 --> 03:52.310
Grabbed Mr. King's wallet,his five-carat ring

03:52.330 --> 03:54.440
and a gold watch with a diamond face.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.450
Worth about 40 grand.

03:56.510 --> 03:57.810
Detective Scanlon...

03:57.830 --> 04:00.000
my mother's finally off the phone.

04:00.010 --> 04:01.850
I think I've convinced her to talk to you.

04:02.250 --> 04:05.270
-Okay,come on.
-Come on,come on,Bridge,go.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.230
Come on,everyone pile in.

04:08.690 --> 04:10.460
Come on...come on,Bridge.

04:12.890 --> 04:14.920
Oh,man!

04:19.180 --> 04:20.920
Somebody broke into the car?

04:24.020 --> 04:25.720
Doesn't look like anything's missing.

04:25.750 --> 04:26.450
I don't get it--

04:26.470 --> 04:28.320
someone just broke your window for no reason at all?

04:28.340 --> 04:29.500
Why would they do that?

04:29.520 --> 04:30.350
I don't know,honey.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.460
Sometimes people do strange things.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.200
Can you pass me that blankie?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.280
I'm so sorry,Daddy.

04:38.300 --> 04:39.300
It's not your fault.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.630
If I hadn't taken up all that room in the garage with my art project...

04:43.540 --> 04:45.630
It's okay.

04:47.840 --> 04:52.400
But I don't understand,why would anyone ever be so mean?

04:52.440 --> 04:54.850
My husband was a wonderful man.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.250
Loyal,devoted...

04:58.450 --> 05:00.820
He was the center of my world.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.690
I understand,on occasion...

05:07.370 --> 05:12.360
that the police have been known to employ the services of psychics.

05:12.750 --> 05:13.470
Mother...

05:13.490 --> 05:15.320
Not withstanding what you might've seen on TV,

05:15.340 --> 05:18.360
that's not really a policy of the Phoenix Police Department,Mrs. King.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.620
Be that as it may,

05:19.650 --> 05:24.600
I've been in touch with a very gifted and sensitive young man from Los Angeles.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.140
As soon as you finish your work here,

05:26.160 --> 05:30.700
I intend to ask him to come here to offer his assistance.

05:30.770 --> 05:33.020
Mom,please don't do this.

05:33.050 --> 05:34.740
Wesley,please.

05:34.760 --> 05:38.010
Mrs. King,speaking as a representative of the District Attorney's Office,

05:38.030 --> 05:40.020
you don't want to do that.

05:40.330 --> 05:42.610
We want to find whoever did this.

05:42.630 --> 05:44.800
We want to put them away for life.

05:44.820 --> 05:46.810
You walk into a court of law,

05:46.830 --> 05:50.210
and you say that a psychic was involved with the preparation of your case,

05:50.230 --> 05:54.090
and frankly,jurors will just start rolling their eyes.

05:54.110 --> 05:57.970
I have spent months getting to know this young man--on the telephone.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.780
He's a thoughtful,sensitive,sober gentleman,

06:01.800 --> 06:05.170
with a rare and valuable gift.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.700
I'm certain that in person

06:07.720 --> 06:11.070
a jury would find him just as compelling as I do.

06:18.700 --> 06:19.880
Thank you for calling PSYLINE.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.660
Your personal phone psychic is on

06:21.680 --> 06:26.090
and ready to open up the portals of the psychic universe.

06:26.110 --> 06:27.650
Michael.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.000
Hey,wait a minute.

06:29.020 --> 06:31.860
I'm the psychic around here.
Who am I talking to?

06:32.280 --> 06:34.860
It's your sister.
It's Allison.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.720
Hey,sis.How cool is this?

06:37.740 --> 06:42.200
Who would've thunk--out of all the phone psychics in the world you had to get me.

06:42.230 --> 06:44.040
I asked for you,Michael.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.800
Hey,did you know that your cell phone's disconnected?

06:46.850 --> 06:47.870
Yeah,I know.

06:47.890 --> 06:51.000
They do that now,after you don't pay the bill.

06:51.130 --> 06:52.630
Don't get mad at me.

06:52.650 --> 06:55.460
I blew out my knee and I couldn't work construction anymore.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.170
Listen,I have to ask you something.

06:57.190 --> 06:59.680
Do you have a client named Tanya King?

06:59.700 --> 07:00.860
Yeah,sure.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.600
Talk to her every Tuesday.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.270
It's pretty sad,though.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.360
I guess she was away,and...

07:05.380 --> 07:08.730
Her husband got beaten to death.Yeah,I know.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.420
They have you on her husband's case?

07:10.450 --> 07:12.140
Wow,you must be a mind reader.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.990
Here's the thing--I have a feeling that she's going to want to get you involved.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.600
-Involved in what? -In the case.

07:19.620 --> 07:20.890
In the investigation.

07:20.910 --> 07:22.860
The search for her husband's killer.

07:22.890 --> 07:24.630
That's crazy. What would I get involved in?

07:24.660 --> 07:25.850
I live in Los Angeles

07:25.870 --> 07:28.930
I'm a telephone psychic and I work in my underwear.

07:29.260 --> 07:30.630
Well,I just left her,

07:30.650 --> 07:35.900
and apparently she thinks you are very gifted,and very sensitive.

07:35.930 --> 07:37.370
Well,you've got nothing to worry about,

07:37.390 --> 07:39.170
because,as you and I both know,

07:39.190 --> 07:42.870
I'm neither gifted nor sensitive,just broke.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.580
And just like the ad says,

07:45.600 --> 07:48.190
"This service is for entertainment purposes only."

07:51.920 --> 07:53.430
Daddy?

07:54.890 --> 07:56.020
Bridge,what are you doing up?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.700
It's late.You're supposed to be asleep.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.430
I know who broke the window of your car.

08:00.450 --> 08:01.720
What are you talking about?

08:01.740 --> 08:04.730
Your window-- I saw who did it.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.620
It was Mrs. Uebershchaer.

08:07.650 --> 08:08.530
Mrs. who?

08:08.560 --> 08:12.250
Mrs. Uebershchaer--my math teacher.

08:14.220 --> 08:17.810
Bridge,honey,how could you have seen that?

08:18.460 --> 08:20.720
It happened last night,when we were all asleep.

08:20.740 --> 08:25.670
I saw it tonight when I went to bed.I had a dream.

08:27.450 --> 08:32.230
Um,and it turns out Bridgette has cracked the mystery of who smashed my car window.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.770
You're kidding. Who?

08:33.789 --> 08:36.690
Apparently it's her mean old math teacher-- Mrs...

08:36.710 --> 08:38.799
-Mrs. Uebershchaer? -Yeah.

08:39.299 --> 08:41.020
She's the culprit,according to Bridgette.

08:41.039 --> 08:44.300
She wants you to tell the people at work,have them arrest her.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.500
She's recommending a life sentence.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.030
Well,it sounds fair.

08:49.370 --> 08:53.720
When I mentioned to her that that might interfere with her completing math class this year

08:53.750 --> 08:56.770
she indicated that that was a sacrifice she was willing to make.

08:56.790 --> 08:57.730
That's laudable.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.590
She's willing to give up a year of math homework

09:00.610 --> 09:02.740
to see that justice is served.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.080
Like mother,like daughter.

09:10.570 --> 09:12.740
Is that the doorbell?

09:15.800 --> 09:17.800
Is somebody at the door?

09:18.650 --> 09:20.170
Hello.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.440
Can I help you?

09:25.010 --> 09:28.010
-Uncle Michael! -Uncle Michael!

09:29.010 --> 09:30.910
Oh,who are you guys?

09:32.760 --> 09:34.380
You could have called first.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.110
I know,I know,I totally should have called.

09:37.130 --> 09:40.460
But I didn't even know that I was going to come here till last night.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.760
We talked about this.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.080
What was I supposed to do?

09:43.100 --> 09:45.030
She flew me out here first class.

09:45.050 --> 09:47.980
I had a fully reclining seat and everything.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.100
Oh,boy,I know that look.

09:52.170 --> 09:55.520
It's the look that I'd get from Mom,right before she threw a shoe at me.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.930
You're lucky we're nowhere near a closet.

09:57.950 --> 10:01.640
What's this about "I'm not a psychic,I'm an entertainer"?

10:01.660 --> 10:02.580
Well,as it turns out,

10:02.600 --> 10:06.320
being a psychic in this particular instance pays a whole lot better.

10:06.330 --> 10:08.400
-How much better? -Tons.

10:08.730 --> 10:11.260
Rental car and hotel room.

10:11.290 --> 10:16.150
She sprung for a new telecommunications upgrade.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.970
Al,come on,don't be like this.

10:20.990 --> 10:22.320
I needed the money.

10:22.340 --> 10:24.180
Besides,I can tell when I was talking to her on the phone

10:24.200 --> 10:25.970
that if I didn't come down here

10:25.990 --> 10:29.740
that she was just gonna hire some other swami to throw her gelt at.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.910
Besides,wouldn't you rather deal with the devil that you know?

10:35.570 --> 10:39.260
Tell me exactly what Mrs. King asked you to do.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.930
I'm supposed to go over to her house,

10:41.950 --> 10:45.300
walk around the scene,touch some stuff,see if I get anything.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.600
-And that's it? -That's it.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.890
She doesn't know I'm a psychic.

10:52.050 --> 10:52.640
'Kay.

10:52.660 --> 10:55.700
And she can't know that we're related.In fact,no one can.

10:56.540 --> 10:59.120
-All right. -No,this is serious.

10:59.140 --> 11:01.450
I keep a low profile with the district attorney's office.

11:01.470 --> 11:03.180
I don't advertise what I do.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.220
People wouldn't understand.

11:05.940 --> 11:10.050
It can't get out that the Kings' out-of-town psychic is my little brother.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.450
No problem.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.340
I just need you to do one little tiny favor for me.

11:14.370 --> 11:15.750
And what's that?

11:15.770 --> 11:18.500
I sure could use a ride to and from Mrs. King's this morning.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.970
You just told me that she gave you money for a rental car.

11:20.990 --> 11:25.310
Yeah,well,but if I don't spend it...

11:28.090 --> 11:30.910
listen,this is not a mature business that I'm running here.

11:30.930 --> 11:34.350
Every extra little penny helps give me that edge.

11:34.390 --> 11:36.820
Okay,I'll tell you what--you call her,

11:36.840 --> 11:40.810
you tell her that you contacted the authorities when you landed this morning

11:40.830 --> 11:44.300
that they assigned me to be your liasion to the police department.

11:44.380 --> 11:45.520
"Liasion."

11:45.550 --> 11:48.380
I like that.It'll impress her.

11:49.870 --> 11:53.650
I'm going to get Joe up I'm going to let him know you're here.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.820
See if maybe I can get him to drive the girls to school.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.100
There's one other little tiny thing I needed to ask you.

11:59.140 --> 12:02.780
If no one's using the couch,I'd sure like to pocket the hotel money,too.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.060
-Bye,sweetie. -Bye,Daddy.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.190
Come on,kiddo.Last stop.

12:10.210 --> 12:11.610
Everyone off the bus.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.620
Hey,there she is!That's her,Daddy!

12:13.660 --> 12:18.030
Aha,the famous Mrs. Ueberschaer,I presume.

12:18.730 --> 12:21.300
So,aren't you gonna go and talk to her?

12:21.910 --> 12:23.010
About what?

12:23.030 --> 12:25.240
About what she did to your window.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.890
Bridgette,I explained that to you last night.

12:28.570 --> 12:31.050
But she's right there.

12:31.290 --> 12:33.380
I know,but,honey,I can't accuse someone

12:33.400 --> 12:35.560
just because you saw something in a dream.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.790
But I saw her,Daddy.

12:38.070 --> 12:41.200
She took a rock and smashed your window with it.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.210
All right,maybe she did and maybe she didn't.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.920
But I still can't accuse someone

12:44.940 --> 12:47.480
just because you saw it in a dream

12:48.490 --> 12:50.100
Now give me a kiss.

12:50.390 --> 12:51.670
Come on.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.800
We'll talk some more tonight.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.520
Michael?

13:05.070 --> 13:07.870
You look exactly how I imagined.

13:16.050 --> 13:17.620
Hard to watch,isn't it?

13:17.650 --> 13:18.890
I'm sorry?

13:18.910 --> 13:21.710
This charade.

13:22.420 --> 13:25.280
Knowing that my mother is paying good money for it.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.750
I swear if my dad were still alive,

13:28.650 --> 13:31.590
he'd have this guy out of the door so fast his head would spin.

13:33.750 --> 13:35.550
Mrs. Dubois.

13:36.350 --> 13:37.860
Thank you.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.060
Michael...

13:41.620 --> 13:44.310
-Tea?
-Uh,no.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.300
In a minute.

13:46.460 --> 13:49.610
I'm starting to feel something.

13:54.550 --> 13:56.600
Tell me.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.720
Tell me what you're feeling.

13:58.740 --> 14:01.460
Um,it's,it's hard to put into words.

14:01.480 --> 14:06.670
Um,different energies,different... auras.

14:07.370 --> 14:09.680
Uh,it's very delicate work.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.820
Well,uh...what about the killer?

14:17.860 --> 14:21.670
Are you sensing anything about Gregory's killer?

14:23.360 --> 14:24.930
I keep...

14:24.950 --> 14:29.520
I keep seeing the color... blue?

14:30.450 --> 14:32.480
Does that mean anything to you?

14:32.500 --> 14:35.540
Gee,maybe it was the mailman,Mom.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.820
Maybe he got tired of Dad not tipping him at Christmas.

14:37.850 --> 14:39.530
Wes,please.

14:40.070 --> 14:41.530
What else,Michael?

14:41.560 --> 14:44.270
You know what actually might help?

14:45.620 --> 14:47.280
Lunch.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.670
Will you be joining us for lunch,Mrs. Dubois?

15:10.640 --> 15:14.900
Actually,I think I prefer to step outside and get some fresh air.

15:14.920 --> 15:19.530
Mr. Benoit,could I see you outside for a moment?

15:19.900 --> 15:22.040
Outside. Absolutely.

15:25.890 --> 15:28.230
Uh,is there somewhere where I could scrub up?

15:34.760 --> 15:37.030
Different auras,different energies.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.700
Shame on you.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.140
Being a little tough on yourself,aren't you?

15:53.030 --> 15:54.520
Give yourself some credit.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.590
You got my wife eating out of your hand.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.010
Mr. King.

16:00.030 --> 16:02.090
Gregory. Yeah.

16:08.390 --> 16:09.440
Hey,sis.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.290
That was quite a performance you gave in there,Karnak.

16:12.310 --> 16:14.680
So tell me,what color is my aura now?

16:15.030 --> 16:16.700
I don't know.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.370
But I think maybe we need to call the police.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.580
What?What for?

16:22.170 --> 16:23.580
I know what the killer looks like.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.750
Well,I have a fairly detailed description of him.

16:27.090 --> 16:29.100
What? From who?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.010
I was just in the bathroom.

16:38.280 --> 16:42.000
Henry Alonzo-- prior arrests include,uh,possession of narcotics,

16:42.010 --> 16:45.530
assault with a deadly weapon,and last but not least...

16:47.810 --> 16:49.100
breaking and entering.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.330
Are you sure?

16:52.350 --> 16:55.180
Are you certain this is the man that Gregory King described to you?

16:55.210 --> 16:56.970
No,I'm not sure.

16:56.990 --> 16:59.150
It was a description,not a photograph.

17:00.190 --> 17:02.170
But you got to admit it is kind of freaky that 

17:02.190 --> 17:07.770
this guy he described has all the qualifications necessary for a career as a thief and a killer.

17:08.140 --> 17:09.460
He makes a good point.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.359
I think I'll see if Mr. Alonzo's around,

17:11.380 --> 17:13.630
maybe invite him down for a little chat.

17:15.089 --> 17:17.550
-Hi,Dad.
-Hey.

17:18.230 --> 17:19.670
-Where's Mom?
-She's working.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.650
I thought you were walking home with Hannah today.

17:21.670 --> 17:24.750
I am,I'm just here to deliver a message from the principal.

17:24.770 --> 17:25.560
Okay.

17:25.579 --> 17:26.990
He wants to see you.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.240
Something about Bridgette.

17:29.260 --> 17:30.600
You understand,Mr. Dubois,

17:30.620 --> 17:32.520
that she said it in front of the entire class.

17:32.550 --> 17:35.090
And now she absolutely refuses to apologize.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.530
Mrs. Ueberschaer?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.600
I'd like for you to meet Bridgette's father.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.860
Hi. Joe. Joe Dubois.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.310
-Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
-Likewise.

17:48.330 --> 17:51.410
I'm very sorry if my daughter has said anything to upset you.

17:52.340 --> 17:55.280
As I'm sure that you've noticed,she has a very vivid imagination.

17:55.580 --> 17:58.100
In my experience,Mr. Dubois,

17:58.150 --> 18:01.690
it is not a parent's job to apologize for their child,

18:01.970 --> 18:06.730
it is a parent's job to make sure their child can apologize for herself.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.220
Bridgette,don't you have something that you want to say to Mrs. Ueberschaer?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.650
Bridgette,we talked about this.

18:22.530 --> 18:25.460
You don't know what actually happened.

18:27.530 --> 18:29.390
Young lady,apologize.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.800
Right now.

18:32.750 --> 18:35.170
I'm sorry,Mrs. Ueberschaer.

18:35.190 --> 18:38.590
I'm sorry that I said you broke my daddy's window.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.680
I guess I don't know what really happened.

18:42.710 --> 18:44.510
Thank you,Bridgette.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.010
Thank you both.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.340
Come on,sweetie.

18:54.080 --> 18:58.760
I put some clean sheets and towels on the couch.

18:58.780 --> 19:00.990
We don't have a spare toothbrush.

19:01.410 --> 19:03.370
Looks like you're gonna have to go buy you one.

19:04.070 --> 19:07.970
I'll just use the toothbrush God gave me.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.900
I thought you said you were thirsty.

19:12.550 --> 19:13.900
I was.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.360
-I am.
-And?

19:18.960 --> 19:22.270
I was just thinking about how one of those always leads to another.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.550
And another and another.

19:25.570 --> 19:29.730
And I remember you said that it makes it harder to feel stuff...

19:30.410 --> 19:32.040
see things.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.960
It really shook you up seeing Gregory King.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.660
Hello?It's Scanlon.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.960
He's right here.

19:52.180 --> 19:53.720
They picked up Henry Alonzo.

19:56.470 --> 19:58.560
He was high as a kite.

19:58.580 --> 20:02.280
He pawned a five carat diamond ring and a diamond face watch.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.130
Both stolen from Gregory King the night he died.

20:06.630 --> 20:08.860
Yeah,he's smiling.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.220
Okay.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.090
Yes.

20:14.810 --> 20:16.490
How'd it go?

20:17.260 --> 20:18.630
She still mad at me?

20:18.650 --> 20:21.740
Well,she still thinks what she dreamt was the truth,so I guess so.

20:26.690 --> 20:28.680
How about our fourth child?

20:28.700 --> 20:30.530
The big lumpy one on the couch.

20:30.970 --> 20:32.900
He fell asleep watching TV.

20:33.050 --> 20:35.050
Fell asleep or passed out?

20:35.360 --> 20:39.130
I'll have you know he didn't drink anything stronger than orange juice today.

20:39.460 --> 20:40.780
Geez.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.040
Guy cracks one lousy murder case,

20:43.060 --> 20:45.630
and suddenly,he's the poster child for sobriety.

20:45.650 --> 20:47.810
Hey,he did good.

20:47.890 --> 20:49.440
I,for one,am proud.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.800
Well,okay,you win.

20:52.820 --> 20:54.690
Once he's out of our living room,

20:54.710 --> 20:56.460
I'll be proud of him,too.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.320
Hold on a second.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.660
I said stop it.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.800
Hey,where you going?

21:11.130 --> 21:12.830
Get back here.

21:16.770 --> 21:20.030
Oh,my God.You're him.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.180
You did this on purpose,didn't you?

21:30.500 --> 21:33.390
You knew who I was from the moment you walked in,

21:34.390 --> 21:37.290
before you even bought me that first drink.

21:39.850 --> 21:41.270
Hey,I don't think we're finished here.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.600
No,no. No,no.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.550
Good morning.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.900
Dude,what is it with you and bathrooms?

22:07.950 --> 22:09.730
Well,where would you prefer we meet?

22:09.970 --> 22:12.980
Around the breakfast table with your sister and the kids?

22:13.690 --> 22:15.620
No,I get that.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.150
So,did you hear we caught your killer?

22:18.180 --> 22:23.230
I certainly did and I couldn't be more grateful for all your help with that,truly.

22:24.590 --> 22:26.660
There's just one more thing I need you to do.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.390
Great.

22:29.410 --> 22:32.340
Mike! Michael!

22:32.830 --> 22:36.150
They're bringing Henry Alonzo in to give a statement in a couple hours.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.310
They want to know if Michael and I want to sit in.

22:38.330 --> 22:39.750
You and Michael?

22:40.250 --> 22:41.660
That's nice. That's thoughtful.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.200
Yeah,well,he is the person who led them to him.

22:44.220 --> 22:46.240
I mean,I think it would mean a lot to him,you know,

22:46.260 --> 22:47.740
seeing it though to the end.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.390
Mike!

22:58.050 --> 23:01.070
Well,that's weird.He's not here.

23:01.330 --> 23:03.870
Hey,Mr. King,I'm sorry to drop by so early in the morning.

23:05.290 --> 23:07.440
My mom isn't here.
She's at the funeral home.

23:07.470 --> 23:08.680
No,that's okay.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.210
I... I came here to see you.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.570
I have a message from your dad.

23:16.490 --> 23:17.960
He asked me to...

23:17.980 --> 23:19.420
Look,

23:19.890 --> 23:22.710
since my dad never had a whole lot to say to me when he was alive

23:22.730 --> 23:27.500
I find it kind of hard to believe he's so desperate to reach me now that he's dead.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.000
Much less through a perfect stranger.

23:30.020 --> 23:31.970
Well,you know,okay,that's funny

23:31.990 --> 23:35.920
because he was telling me this story about when you were five,maybe.

23:35.940 --> 23:40.460
He said that you and he were in this dinghy on the way out to his sailboat.

23:40.940 --> 23:43.380
You slipped on a railing,hit your head on a winch,

23:43.420 --> 23:45.080
started bleeding like a stuck pig.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.670
You needed seven stitches.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.910
You saw the scar on my head

23:51.930 --> 23:56.710
did some kind of Internet search to dig up my old  hospital records or something.

23:56.750 --> 23:58.140
I'm very impressed,okay?

23:58.160 --> 24:01.050
But like I said,my mom will be back later.

24:01.070 --> 24:02.010
-Why don't you.
-Your father said that

24:02.030 --> 24:04.350
when he picked you up,saw your face covered in all that blood,

24:04.370 --> 24:06.150
he said,"Wesley,suck it up.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.850
You need to taste blood if you want to be a man."

24:09.760 --> 24:15.290
And then he said,"What a stupid thing to say to a five-year-old.

24:16.010 --> 24:18.460
One of my life's great regrets."

24:20.930 --> 24:25.320
"The kid needed a hug and I did a bad Hemingway impression."

24:32.450 --> 24:34.580
I always felt his glare on me.

24:35.280 --> 24:41.580
It was like nothing I did was ever right:

24:42.050 --> 24:46.080
my work,my friends,women I dated.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.540
Well,I mean,

24:47.560 --> 24:49.490
it's not like he feels that way now.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.220
In fact,your father wanted me to tell you--

24:52.240 --> 24:54.530
and he said that you would know what he was talking about--

24:55.390 --> 25:00.150
that he would never let anyone tell him who he could or could not be with.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.390
And you should do the same thing.

25:03.140 --> 25:05.290
Does that make any sense to you?

25:08.810 --> 25:13.090
Well,good,'cause it was really important to your father.

25:13.110 --> 25:15.000
And he told me that he wanted you you to know

25:15.010 --> 25:19.610
that whatever objections he had before... are gone.

25:21.310 --> 25:23.320
He said that you would know what that meant.

25:28.180 --> 25:31.870
Good. Your father's counting on you,Wesley.

25:32.630 --> 25:37.120
He wants you to take control,secure his legacy.

25:39.120 --> 25:44.110
He told me that he sees himself in you now in a way that he never did before.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.420
Bye,Daddy.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.480
Hey,what,no kiss today?

26:14.570 --> 26:16.470
-I love you.
-Love you,too.

26:41.570 --> 26:43.840
He was like a totally different person.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.730
Knowing that his dad felt that way,

26:47.910 --> 26:50.070
getting that message from beyond the grave,

26:51.300 --> 26:53.050
it looked like it transformed him.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.470
It looks like it did you some good,too.

26:55.910 --> 26:58.720
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you where I was going.

26:59.470 --> 27:01.500
I was just... you know...

27:03.340 --> 27:06.440
But after seeing Mr. King,

27:06.460 --> 27:09.000
helping him reconcile,make things right with his kid...

27:10.690 --> 27:12.900
catching the killer.

27:15.630 --> 27:17.780
It's been an amazing couple of days.

27:20.410 --> 27:23.960
By the way,I'm not completely convinced about the whole

27:24.350 --> 27:26.030
finding-the-killer thing.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.940
What are you talking about,Alison?

27:29.490 --> 27:32.360
We found him.I found him.

27:32.750 --> 27:33.560
He's found.

27:33.580 --> 27:36.550
We're driving over there to hear his confession right now.

27:36.940 --> 27:40.600
Don't... Don't mess this up for me.

27:40.650 --> 27:42.380
It's over. This has happened.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.020
It's past tense.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.020
A trivia question. Nostal...

27:46.050 --> 27:47.410
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?!

27:47.430 --> 27:48.260
Yeah,I do.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.220
It's just... I had a dream.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.890
and your friend Mr. King was in it with a woman--

27:53.210 --> 27:54.570
a very young woman.

27:54.590 --> 27:57.050
Her name was Monica. She was not his wife.

27:57.570 --> 27:59.340
They were at his place

28:00.120 --> 28:02.010
and she seemed completely out of place there.

28:02.030 --> 28:05.610
I mean,she had a tattoo of barbed wire around her harm.

28:06.440 --> 28:10.620
They started arguing and then it got violent.

28:15.210 --> 28:18.170
What's any of this got to do with the price of rice in China,Alison?

28:18.190 --> 28:19.490
I don't know.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.840
Why am I seeing it? Why?

28:23.190 --> 28:25.520
I mean,if this case is really over,

28:25.550 --> 28:26.930
why am I still dreaming about it?

28:26.950 --> 28:28.950
What difference does it make?!

28:29.300 --> 28:30.330
What are you going to pay attention to,some dumb dream 

28:30.350 --> 28:33.870
or your brother who's sitting right in front you telling you 

28:33.890 --> 28:38.180
that he had a close encounter in the bathroom with forces from the other side?

28:42.060 --> 28:44.100
Yeah,rain on my parade.

28:44.850 --> 28:49.700
I was passed out in an alley behind a warehouse on Pine Street.

28:50.170 --> 28:53.000
I woke up when I heard a car blowing up.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.430
And you saw some guy toss a $40,000 watch

28:56.450 --> 28:58.670
and a five-carat ring into a Dumpster.

28:58.690 --> 29:00.880
I'm just telling you what I saw.

29:04.230 --> 29:06.460
Can you tell me the make and model of the car?

29:06.480 --> 29:07.620
Can you describe the driver?

29:07.640 --> 29:11.410
Can you tell me anything that makes what you're saying sound even the slightest bit credible?

29:11.430 --> 29:13.500
I don't know. I don't remember.

29:13.910 --> 29:16.050
This is so the guy.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.310
Oh,can you believe it?

29:19.330 --> 29:23.280
I swear,after this,after they close this case,

29:23.320 --> 29:26.920
I'm going to find this friend of mine from the army-- he's LAPD now.

29:26.940 --> 29:28.640
I think that I can convince him

29:28.660 --> 29:32.790
to take me on as a consultant,just like you.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.450
I can't believe you're doing this.

29:44.140 --> 29:46.170
I'm sorry. Doing what?

29:47.960 --> 29:51.200
You're jealous,aren't you?

29:51.220 --> 29:52.880
What are you talking about?

29:52.900 --> 29:55.800
I guess there can only be one official,secret

29:55.820 --> 29:58.300
police psychic in this family,huh?

29:59.350 --> 30:01.200
Official secret police psychic?

30:01.220 --> 30:03.300
You know what I'm talking about,Allison.

30:03.690 --> 30:06.980
I didn't crack this case,I smashed it.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.790
They found this guy red-handed

30:08.810 --> 30:10.750
with all the stuff from Mr. King's house.

30:10.770 --> 30:14.700
I've got him dead to rights and it's driving you crazy.

30:14.790 --> 30:16.170
It's not making me crazy.

30:16.190 --> 30:17.610
Nothing is making me crazy.

30:17.630 --> 30:19.450
I look at this man

30:19.470 --> 30:21.860
I listen to the theory of his crime.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.250
I'm not sure I believe it.

30:23.270 --> 30:25.060
That's because you don't want to believe it...

30:25.080 --> 30:26.960
because it means that your little brother Michael

30:26.980 --> 30:29.450
has got it all going on,just like you.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.140
Just... like... you.

30:34.170 --> 30:35.780
Just like you.

30:36.910 --> 30:38.270
Where are you going?

30:38.970 --> 30:41.860
I'm going to spend some of that hotel money,that's where.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.960
You're absolutely sure?

30:52.490 --> 30:54.280
That's not remotely possible.

30:54.600 --> 30:57.510
Okay,well,thank you very much for the information,Doctor.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.180
Hmm? Doctor?

31:00.200 --> 31:02.210
County medical examiner.

31:03.630 --> 31:06.750
Apparently,Gregory King was definitely killed by a man.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.710
They can tell that just from an autopsy?

31:09.730 --> 31:12.660
From the severity of the wounds and the location on the body.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.400
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

31:15.040 --> 31:15.850
Yeah,they're positive.

31:15.870 --> 31:19.150
Gregory King was definitely killed by a man who was at least five-foot-eight.

31:19.660 --> 31:23.920
So he couldn't have been killed by a petite 20-something named Monica?

31:23.950 --> 31:25.100
Apparently not.

31:26.510 --> 31:27.640
So,have you called him yet?

31:27.660 --> 31:29.320
My brother? About 40 times.

31:29.350 --> 31:30.800
He just doesn't answer his phone.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.300
I'm gonna take a shower.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.860
Hello?

31:43.700 --> 31:45.740
Yes,he is.May I ask who's calling?

31:48.890 --> 31:51.310
It's Laurie Jameson from the Neighborhood Watch group.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.650
Hello... Hello,Laurie.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.770
Michael.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.900
Thank you so much for stopping by on your way to the airport.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.170
I wanted to be able to say thank you in person.

32:06.690 --> 32:08.160
you don't need to thank me.

32:08.180 --> 32:10.370
You know,you paid me to do a job.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.700
I'm just happy that I was actually able to do it for you.

32:12.740 --> 32:14.200
Oh,Michael.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.390
Come in.

32:19.990 --> 32:24.500
Michael,you did so much more than I ever could have imagined.

32:24.830 --> 32:27.730
Those messages that you brought us from my late husband...

32:28.410 --> 32:29.840
Oh,you couldn't possibly know this,

32:29.860 --> 32:31.760
but they've changed everything.

32:33.060 --> 32:35.240
Uh... what are you talking about?

32:35.280 --> 32:36.850
Oh,please,come. I want you to...

32:36.870 --> 32:38.420
I want you to meet someone.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.580
I want you to meet my son's fianc?

32:41.650 --> 32:44.440
Michael,this is Monica.

32:44.890 --> 32:47.510
Hi.Nice to meet you.

32:52.410 --> 32:54.910
Tell them you need to use the bathroom.

32:54.930 --> 32:56.570
Do it.

33:04.180 --> 33:06.220
You looked puzzled out there.

33:07.850 --> 33:09.770
You knew her. Monica?

33:09.790 --> 33:11.660
You knew that woman,didn't you?

33:12.100 --> 33:13.380
Run some water.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.640
They can't hear me,but they can hear you.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.080
She killed you,didn't she?

33:19.100 --> 33:22.000
You and her had a thing and she killed you.

33:22.020 --> 33:23.230
You like that story?

33:23.730 --> 33:25.430
Me,personally--

33:25.920 --> 33:27.810
I prefer the Henry Alonzo story.

33:27.830 --> 33:29.400
Now that's a great story.

33:29.420 --> 33:32.030
You got a sympathetic victim: me.

33:32.610 --> 33:36.260
You have a villain we can all root against.

33:36.730 --> 33:39.670
An unemployed drug addict with a criminal record.

33:40.990 --> 33:44.340
And...we have the added bonus of your involvement.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.260
No small thing,as far as my wife is concerned.

33:47.930 --> 33:50.220
I'm asking you a direct question.

33:50.250 --> 33:51.930
Henry Alonzo killed me.

33:51.950 --> 33:53.680
You closed the case.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.750
Take the win and go home.

33:55.770 --> 33:58.180
Okay,then I'm gonna go out there and tell them that Monica killed you.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.530
I wish you wouldn't.

33:59.550 --> 34:01.200
Why,'cause it's true?

34:01.870 --> 34:02.870
Because he loves her.

34:04.770 --> 34:06.550
And because it isn't true.

34:07.950 --> 34:11.300
You know,Mr. Gregory,I'm gonna be honest with you.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.760
The more time I spend with you,the less I seem to like you.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.760
But,you are my first real,

34:17.780 --> 34:19.949
for profit,visitation from the other side,

34:19.969 --> 34:22.120
so,that counts for something.

34:22.550 --> 34:24.690
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

34:25.440 --> 34:29.239
If it isn't Henry Alonzo,and it's not your son's fianc? then who?

34:33.980 --> 34:36.199
Did Wesley know about the two of you?

34:36.219 --> 34:38.030
There was no two of us.

34:39.540 --> 34:42.750
I thought my son was weak,feckless.

34:43.179 --> 34:45.360
I was trying to protect him.

34:45.380 --> 34:48.050
By seducing his girlfriend.

34:48.070 --> 34:51.250
I thought I had to prove something to him

34:51.540 --> 34:54.659
about his girlfriend's character.

34:54.679 --> 34:59.390
Instead...I found something out about his.

34:59.870 --> 35:01.740
She told him,didn't she?

35:01.760 --> 35:03.700
She told Wesley that you tried.

35:04.590 --> 35:07.040
One of the real secrets of my success in business

35:07.060 --> 35:09.040
has always been my ability to...

35:09.340 --> 35:14.440
sell anything-- almost anything--to almost anyone at any time.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.950
but I could not convince that boy

35:18.400 --> 35:21.850
that the girl he's in love with was lying.

35:22.640 --> 35:26.060
Oh,my God.He did it.

35:28.130 --> 35:30.330
Your own son.

35:32.670 --> 35:34.860
I honestly can't even... 

35:34.910 --> 35:37.680
begin to describe to you the collision of emotions.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.600
I mean... you're staring at your own death.

35:40.830 --> 35:43.520
And yet,I didn't think he had it in him.

35:43.900 --> 35:47.520
I mean,the way he made it look like a robbery.

35:47.540 --> 35:50.340
Taking my watch and ring and throwing them in that Dumpster.

35:50.650 --> 35:52.800
I'm not sure I could have come up with that.

35:52.820 --> 35:55.460
I'm gonna have to tell them-- you know that.

35:57.190 --> 36:01.230
Seven-four,two,zero-five.

36:02.540 --> 36:03.390
What?

36:03.410 --> 36:06.800
That's half the routing number of an account in the bank in Malacca.

36:06.820 --> 36:09.400
You get the other half when you arrive in Spain.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.030
There's exactly $349,000 in that account

36:12.050 --> 36:14.100
and I'm the only one who knows about it.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.960
That's enough for you to start having a real life,

36:17.990 --> 36:20.290
to make something of yourself.

36:20.980 --> 36:25.420
Just let her father give his son,in death,

36:25.440 --> 36:27.770
what he couldn't in life.

36:28.310 --> 36:30.410
And let an innocent man go to jail.

36:30.430 --> 36:34.460
The question here isn't about Henry Alonzo.

36:35.180 --> 36:37.630
It's about Michael Benoit.

36:38.140 --> 36:40.810
Is he going to walk away from this experience a rich man

36:40.830 --> 36:44.790
or is he going back to work at the 900 phone lines?

36:52.870 --> 36:55.070
Mrs. Ueberschaer.

36:55.900 --> 36:57.960
Joe Dubois. We met the other day.

36:58.370 --> 37:00.100
Yes,of course.

37:00.470 --> 37:02.720
Well,what can I do for you,Mr. Dubois?

37:02.750 --> 37:05.650
Well,I was just wondering,how do you like your car?

37:06.030 --> 37:07.100
'Cause I really love mine.

37:07.120 --> 37:10.010
I love everything about it-- even the color is perfect.

37:10.030 --> 37:12.100
You went for the metallic brown too,didn't you?

37:13.080 --> 37:16.220
Is there something I can help you with,Mr. Dubois?

37:19.090 --> 37:22.840
Well,I'm guessing Ueberschaer isn't the most common of names.

37:22.880 --> 37:25.960
Would it surprise you to learn that we got one living on our street?

37:26.390 --> 37:27.760
I,myself,didn't know till I checked

37:27.790 --> 37:30.060
with the Neighborhood Watch this morning.

37:30.450 --> 37:33.370
Gladys Ueberschaer-- she moved in a few months ago,

37:33.390 --> 37:36.030
just a couple doors down from our house.

37:36.330 --> 37:39.370
I went over and introduced myself this morning and,uh...

37:39.390 --> 37:42.720
it turns out that she's got a sister-in-law who teaches at this school.

37:42.740 --> 37:45.530
Yeah,the sister-in-law came over for dinner last Sunday night,the same night

37:45.810 --> 37:50.280
somebody smashed the window of my metallic brown '04 Jeep Cherokee.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.120
You got them mixed up,right?

37:54.150 --> 37:56.230
You tried to put your key in my Jeep.

37:56.250 --> 37:58.140
And then when the door wouldn't open,

37:58.160 --> 38:00.790
you broke the window to get inside.

38:01.950 --> 38:03.740
You probably didn't even figure out your mistake

38:03.760 --> 38:06.970
until the key wouldn't work in the ignition either.

38:09.380 --> 38:12.300
Here.This is the bill.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.740
What it cost me to fix the window that you smashed.

38:15.330 --> 38:18.950
All the time,all the upset--that's on the house.

38:19.800 --> 38:23.700
Y... You actually expect me to pay that?

38:24.250 --> 38:28.130
A parent's job,Mrs. Ueberschaer,is to listen to their child.

38:29.010 --> 38:32.270
Now,Bridget is telling me that I ought to go to the police on this.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.470
Maybe she's right about that,too.

38:39.880 --> 38:42.420
Hey,official secret police psychic.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.480
Can I ask you a question?

38:48.360 --> 38:51.080
How are we gonna get Henry Alonzo out of jail?

38:52.660 --> 38:55.300
Mr. King,I was starting to worry you weren't gonna make it.

38:55.320 --> 38:59.410
Sorry. I was at a meeting with some of the partners at my dad's company.

38:59.430 --> 39:02.950
I'm trying to figure out where I fit in the new hierarchy.

39:04.390 --> 39:06.880
You said the district attorney had some questions for me.

39:06.900 --> 39:09.670
He's just finishing up with someone in the conference room.

39:09.690 --> 39:11.510
Right this way.

39:19.310 --> 39:20.870
Monica?

39:23.420 --> 39:25.250
I'm so sorry,Wes.

39:25.270 --> 39:26.850
They knew everything.

39:26.870 --> 39:28.450
I couldn't lie.

39:29.170 --> 39:31.390
I don't understand. What are you talking about?

39:32.940 --> 39:33.550
Monica.

39:33.570 --> 39:35.250
-I'm sorry.
-Monica!

39:35.720 --> 39:37.800
What did you tell them?

39:39.840 --> 39:42.010
Does someone please want to tell me what the hell is going on here?

39:42.030 --> 39:45.080
Your fianc was just telling us about the night your father tried to seduce her.

39:45.100 --> 39:48.970
Said she came clean with you about it just hours before he was killed.

39:49.660 --> 39:52.000
I guess she just decided she'd rather have a clear conscience

39:52.010 --> 39:53.940
than be an accessory to murder.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.150
Now,if you wouldn't mind,Mr. King,

39:57.170 --> 39:59.990
we have a lot we'd like to discuss with you.

40:09.350 --> 40:11.080
What a waste.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.950
You're still here.

40:17.970 --> 40:19.480
I gave that boy everything.

40:20.300 --> 40:23.420
I tried to make him a man,and here he is blubbering to the cops.

40:23.450 --> 40:25.110
Well,if it's of any consolation,

40:25.130 --> 40:27.490
my sister says he'll probably get manslaughter.

40:28.280 --> 40:31.500
Yeah,with good behavior-- five years.

40:31.820 --> 40:32.680
Yeah,right.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.000
Knowing him,he'll be a model prisoner.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.440
And you-- you're no better.

40:37.670 --> 40:39.940
I offered you a chance of a whole new life.

40:40.510 --> 40:42.120
Hope you're happy.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.810
Actually,I am.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.960
Well,I gotta go.I just spotted my ride to the airport.

40:53.120 --> 40:56.550
I guess you've got some traveling of your own to do.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.260
Pack for warm weather.
