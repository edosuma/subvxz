WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.271
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Welcome back, friends.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.040
You'll recall, Jane reunited
with her first love, Adam.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.042
And Rafael, well, he'd reunited

00:08.076 --> 00:09.410
with his first wife, Petra.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.312
But things will
be different now.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.115
We'll communicate,
and I'll listen.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.049
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Sweet, right?

00:15.083 --> 00:16.317
Not as sweet...

00:16.350 --> 00:18.119
I am done feeling guilty

00:18.152 --> 00:19.487
'cause I don't want Mateo
to have some small life

00:19.520 --> 00:21.122
where he counts pennies
and doesn't get

00:21.155 --> 00:22.323
on a plane
till he's 20 years old.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.424
You know, if Mateo grew up

00:23.457 --> 00:24.825
to say something like that,

00:24.858 --> 00:26.660
I would feel like
I failed as a parent.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.661
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And it seemed like they'd be

00:27.695 --> 00:28.662
stuck together a while longer.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.165
What the hell?

00:31.199 --> 00:32.666
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, see, Raf's sister, Luisa,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.202
had kicked him out
of her hotel.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.503
And even worse, she'd teamed up

00:35.536 --> 00:38.072
with Petra's twin sister,
Anezka.

00:38.106 --> 00:40.674
I know, straight out
of a telenovela, right?

00:40.708 --> 00:44.178
And speaking of, Jane's father
had married Jane's mom.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.513
Only problem...

00:45.546 --> 00:47.615
It's your dad's.
Oh, my God.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.350
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which reminds me, remember when

00:49.383 --> 00:51.519
Jane slept with
her father's co-star, Fabian,

00:51.552 --> 00:53.754
and he introduced her to his
granny, on, like, night three?

00:53.787 --> 00:55.423
Well, ever since she ended it,

00:55.456 --> 00:57.191
things had gotten
a little tense

00:57.225 --> 00:59.760
between the men on set,
but that was small potatoes

00:59.793 --> 01:00.861
compared to this big news.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.531
I think I'm in labor.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.199
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know, right?

01:05.233 --> 01:06.667
So let's give birth
to this episode already.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.204
As you all know,

01:10.238 --> 01:12.173
Jane Gloriana Villanueva
has always believed

01:12.206 --> 01:13.274
in following rules.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.176
You know the rules.
Pick that up.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.645
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, boy, what did Mateo do now?

01:17.678 --> 01:21.149
I am serious, you pick that up
right now and you...

01:21.182 --> 01:22.250
chug that beer!

01:22.283 --> 01:23.384
ALL:
Chug! Chug! Chug...

01:23.417 --> 01:24.885
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey,

01:24.918 --> 01:26.220
drinking games
need structure, too.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.655
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

01:27.688 --> 01:29.323
Who's the champ?
I'm the champ.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.724
Change that leaderboard, Flaco,

01:30.758 --> 01:32.260
and never question
my dominance again.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.161
Okay, one more round?

01:33.194 --> 01:34.228
I can't, I got to go home.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.329
Oh, boo.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.464
I know, I suck, but I have

01:36.497 --> 01:38.166
early morning school drop-off.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.333
Say good-bye to Fun Jane.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.501
It's back to Mom Jane.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.203
Hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.674
For the road.

01:46.707 --> 01:52.346
That is you and your alter ego.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.648
Kind of like , uh,
Bruce Wayne and Batman.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.484
I like it.
And thank you

01:56.517 --> 01:57.851
for keeping the reference basic.

01:57.885 --> 01:58.852
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.188
And I am your Alfred.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.223
Oh, you lost me already.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.424
I'm the one that gets
to see the secret part.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.825
Mm, I like that, too.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.495
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

02:09.397 --> 02:10.831
Mm-mm-mwah.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.301
Hey...

02:13.334 --> 02:14.435
Come back soon, bro.
Yup.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.504
Ooh, save me
some pizza rolls, fam.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.206
Fun Jane out!

02:18.239 --> 02:19.840
MATEO:
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,

02:19.873 --> 02:21.609
I'm gonna slime you.
Nuh-uh-uh-uh.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.277
You know the rules.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.846
No more shenanigans
with protein shakes.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.616
Rafael.
Here's the thing.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.851
Chase, you'd be crazy
not to get in on this.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.386
It's a minimal capital ask.
(mouthing)

02:32.420 --> 02:33.887
You would acquire
two-thirds of the Marbella,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.756
and that means
majority control.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.792
How can you stand this?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.361
His crap is everywhere.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.435
Abuela, that doesn't mean
what you think it means.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.812
Chase... Chase, look,

02:58.846 --> 03:00.814
you'll be kicking yourself
if you pass this up.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.650
Okay, we are gonna
print money.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.552
Zen Rafael was so
much less annoying

03:04.585 --> 03:06.220
than Douche Rafael.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.921
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Speaking of alter egos...

03:07.955 --> 03:10.958
(laughing)

03:13.494 --> 03:15.563
Of course I'm mad at him.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.568
But it is his fault that he
wanted to get the hotel back

03:20.601 --> 03:22.403
with a ridiculous
scheme that pissed off

03:22.436 --> 03:24.672
his crazy sister so much that
she froze Mateo's trust fund.

03:24.705 --> 03:28.242
And Mateo's school
tuition check bounced.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.281
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Damn,
Alba is ride-or-die for Rafael.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.383
Okay, well, I also
don't want to be late

03:35.416 --> 03:37.318
for public school
registration.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.388
It's really a once-in-
a-lifetime opportunity.
(mouthing)

03:40.421 --> 03:41.755
Okay?

03:41.789 --> 03:43.391
To just turn a quick mil...

03:43.424 --> 03:46.260
Okay...

03:46.294 --> 03:49.029
Well, wake me up when you
come to your senses, Chase.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.030
How many steps today?

03:50.063 --> 03:50.998
Ah...

03:54.535 --> 03:56.470
So super awesome.
So...

03:56.504 --> 03:57.605
we can't be late today.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.307
Well, we still have ten minutes.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.608
Hey, have you started
the wash yet?

04:03.010 --> 04:05.546
Oh, yes, thank you.
(phone chiming)

04:05.579 --> 04:06.747
Hey, Petra.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.055
*

04:15.088 --> 04:17.958
And I hear that,
Petra, I do.

04:17.991 --> 04:22.630
His "mature relationship" voice
is even more annoying

04:22.663 --> 04:24.298
than his douche voice.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.638
Your tone is hurtful.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.006
And I am sorry
for hurting your feelings.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.642
That was not my intention.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.745
But, as you know,
I am being followed and harassed

04:37.778 --> 04:38.712
by my... Oh!

04:40.113 --> 04:41.849
I have to go.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.353
Okay, what?

04:45.386 --> 04:46.320
Do you just stand there
looking through the peephole

04:46.354 --> 04:47.488
until I come out?

04:47.521 --> 04:51.024
(laughing): Don't be silly.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.461
I have a high stool I sit on.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.597
My biggest regret in
life is that you didn't
drown in the Atlantic.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.399
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You may be
wondering whyPetra didn't have

04:58.432 --> 04:59.867
her sister arrested
for attempted murder.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.436
Go ahead,
report to police.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.837
It will become
top news story,

05:03.871 --> 05:07.107
and hotel reputation
will be ruined.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.610
All beautiful sister
has to do is

05:09.643 --> 05:12.380
give Dr. Luisa permission
to sell hotel.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.615
I have papers to
sign right here.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.385
For the last time, I'm
not selling my shares.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.119
And stop calling her doctor.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.388
She lost her
license years ago.
(elevator bell chimes)

05:20.421 --> 05:23.457
Then how come
she found my fibroids?

05:23.491 --> 05:24.725
Aah...!

05:24.758 --> 05:26.494
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, wow.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.795
Last time I heard
a scream like that,

05:27.828 --> 05:30.798
Darci was going into labor.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.467
Or, rather, false labor
brought on by stress,

05:33.501 --> 05:35.068
resulting in...

05:35.102 --> 05:36.470
Xo!

05:36.504 --> 05:37.571
...bed rest.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.510
I said "Xo," not "Ro."

05:42.543 --> 05:45.379
Xo is indisposed.
Can I get you something?

05:45.413 --> 05:47.448
(monitor beeping)

05:48.682 --> 05:50.484
(chiming)

05:50.518 --> 05:53.086
Stay back. It's bad enough
I can't be alone.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.055
I don't need to see
your big, stupid face.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.657
Aren't you supposed
to be back at work?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.826
Or did they notice
your ten-pound weight gain

05:58.859 --> 06:00.461
and write you off the novela?

06:00.494 --> 06:04.532
For the sake
of our unborn child,

06:04.565 --> 06:07.000
I will continue to rise
above your insults.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.069
And I return to work tomorrow.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.170
What are you waiting for, then?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.439
You only have 24 hours

06:11.472 --> 06:12.740
to learn how to act.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.374
(laughs)

06:20.147 --> 06:23.484
(gasps) Never go to
the bathroom again!

06:23.517 --> 06:26.454
Breathe. Now, go ahead,
let it out.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.623
She's the most maddening
woman ever to exist.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.459
And she called me fat.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.193
That woman has gained
at least 30 pounds

06:33.226 --> 06:35.195
since she got pregnant,
and even I know

06:35.228 --> 06:37.097
babies don't weigh 30 pounds!

06:37.130 --> 06:39.867
What?
Why are you smiling?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.769
Because I've been thinking.
Remember what she said

06:41.802 --> 06:43.103
during dinner last night?

06:43.136 --> 06:45.138
That my pasta is
more flaccid than my...

06:45.172 --> 06:46.540
After that.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.975
The little dig
about you going back

06:48.008 --> 06:50.210
to obsessing about work
after the baby comes,

06:50.243 --> 06:52.480
and how she'll be stuck
doing everything?

06:52.513 --> 06:54.047
I have an idea.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.449
RAFAEL:
What was Chase thinking?

06:55.483 --> 06:57.451
He turns down the deal,
then offers me a job

06:57.485 --> 06:58.719
selling condos?

06:58.752 --> 07:01.789
I don't sell real estate,
I buy it.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.557
Priorities, please.
This is going to be

07:03.591 --> 07:05.593
Mateo's school
for the next six years.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.728
Six years? No way.
One, tops.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.963
I'm getting my money back.
Well, even so,
we might love it.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.231
I have great memories

07:11.264 --> 07:13.166
of the public kindergarten
I went to.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.636
Here?
No, this one was overcrowded

07:15.669 --> 07:17.638
and I was reassigned. But...

07:17.671 --> 07:18.906
don't worry.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.642
Okay, class sizes are
capped in Florida now.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.811
So just give it a chance, okay?

07:23.844 --> 07:25.746
No way in hell is
Mateo going there!

07:25.779 --> 07:27.581
Now I see why their ratings
are so low.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.617
The building is falling apart.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.752
I'm so sorry, hon,
I know you wanted to love it.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.521
It is so unfair.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.256
It has half the budget of public
schools in wealthier districts.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.491
How is that okay?

07:37.525 --> 07:39.192
I-I mean, it's a
vicious cycle--

07:39.226 --> 07:40.994
rich kids get
better schools,

07:41.028 --> 07:43.163
better education, get
into better colleges,

07:43.196 --> 07:45.533
earn more money, put it
back into their schools...

07:45.566 --> 07:47.167
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Preach, mama.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.602
Could you ever convince Rafael
to go Catholic?

07:48.636 --> 07:51.639
It's way less expensive
than private.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.508
Ro-- I mean, we--
could probably afford it.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.777
Isn't he still paying off the De
La Vega-Factor Factor lawsuit?

07:56.810 --> 08:00.113
Yeah, but I've seen
our finances; we can spare it.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.215
Let me check if there
are any openings first,

08:02.249 --> 08:03.517
before asking Dad.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.952
And Rafael.
But thank you.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.622
Cool. Now,
where are those arepas?

08:08.656 --> 08:10.023
(phone chimes)
Darci will tear me a new one

08:10.057 --> 08:11.625
if I come home empty-handed.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.894
(giggles)

08:13.927 --> 08:16.129
That's not a "looking
into Catholic school" giggle.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.666
It's Adam.
He tagged my dinosaur.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.668
Kinky.
No,

08:20.701 --> 08:24.805
it's not a sex thing,
it's a phone game.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.306
But, now that you brought it up,

08:26.339 --> 08:27.975
I think I am ready
to have sex with him.

08:28.008 --> 08:28.909
Really?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.311
So it's serious?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.746
I still don't know.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.147
Our lives are so different.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.049
But you were right--
I don't need to know

08:36.083 --> 08:37.818
where it's going
in order to have sex with him.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.921
Unless you think I should wait
to know if it's serious.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.590
No, no, no, no, no,
definitely not.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.992
It's early, no need
to think long-term.

08:45.025 --> 08:49.597
You go over there tonight
and tag that dinosaur.

08:50.731 --> 08:51.999
(knocking on door)

08:52.032 --> 08:53.601
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well...

08:53.634 --> 08:55.569
those aren't beer pong clothes.

08:55.603 --> 08:56.704
(mouths)

08:56.737 --> 08:59.006
Okay, wow, yeah,
great. Thanks.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.274
Yeah, let me think on that
and I'll call you back.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.710
(exhales)

09:02.743 --> 09:03.677
What is it?

09:03.711 --> 09:06.113
Something insane just happened.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.016
I-I applied for a VFX job
months ago.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.719
And I-I didn't think
I had a chance in hell,

09:11.752 --> 09:14.121
but they just
offered me the job.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.089
But that's amazing!

09:16.123 --> 09:17.925
Yeah, I know.
(laughs)

09:17.958 --> 09:21.094
Only the-the job is in L.A.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.196
Oh.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.298
Well...

09:25.332 --> 09:26.867
Still amazing.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.736
Congratulations.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.038
I'll, um...

09:31.071 --> 09:32.272
I'll really miss you.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.642
Well, uh,
that's the thing, Jane.

09:34.675 --> 09:35.876
This might
sound crazy, but

09:35.909 --> 09:37.911
if you want me to stay, I will.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.614
In a heartbeat.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.682
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Whoa.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.116
So I guess we are thinking
long-term.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.224
And so he has 72 hours
to decide on the job,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.994
which gives me, like, 71 hours
to decide how I feel about him

09:54.027 --> 09:55.829
or if he fits into my life
or Mateo's life.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.065
Except, how can I even
do that when it's just

09:58.098 --> 10:00.668
way too soon to even
introduce him to Mateo?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.402
DARCI: Sounds like
classic passive-aggressive

10:02.435 --> 10:03.737
commitment transference to me.

10:03.771 --> 10:04.772
That's a big red flag.

10:04.805 --> 10:05.773
Unless he's the one.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.574
Pineapple juice?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.342
How do you know
if he's the one?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.812
Oh, I've got tons of material

10:11.845 --> 10:13.246
from my course at
the Learning Annex.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.648
Compatibility quizzes,

10:14.682 --> 10:17.017
research reports,
algorithms...

10:17.050 --> 10:19.119
Jane doesn't need a test
to figure out her love life.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.788
And you're not
supposed to be working.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.422
Well, I'm bored senseless.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.758
The idiot celebrity magazines
your husband keeps buying me

10:24.792 --> 10:26.359
are killing my brain cells.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.429
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to take a whiz.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.734
(groans) This baby's riding my
bladder like a carnival pony.

10:33.767 --> 10:34.768
(sighs)

10:34.802 --> 10:37.805
How are you
not blowing your brains out?

10:37.838 --> 10:40.207
Because there's a plan
in motion.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.210
Ro's building a nursery on set
to show how committed he is

10:43.243 --> 10:44.978
to being a good dad.
Aw.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.114
I'll check it out
while I'm there.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.717
Our Lady of Mercy
has an opening,

10:49.750 --> 10:51.284
and I'm going to ask
about tuition.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.686
Wish me luck.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.688
ROGELIO:
How lucky am I?

10:54.722 --> 10:56.456
A cake!
(chuckles)

10:56.489 --> 10:57.691
You shouldn't have.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.859
Thank you,

10:58.892 --> 10:59.893
from the bottom of my heart,

10:59.927 --> 11:02.229
for excluding my archnemesis,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.698
Fabian!
Party!

11:04.732 --> 11:07.167
Hello, hello, everyone,
welcome back from reruns.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.137
Meet Alejandro,
a sickly kitten

11:10.170 --> 11:12.205
that I rescued and nursed
back to health.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.076
Why does he get a cake?

11:16.109 --> 11:19.012
You're just jealous because
mine is bigger and better.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.480
And my cake is, too.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.983
Your cake is so vulgar
and distasteful.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.185
And posing in the nude
with a feline

11:25.218 --> 11:27.020
is so 2014.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.724
I'll show you distasteful.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.392
(gasps)

11:35.162 --> 11:36.830
(grunts)
That's it!

11:36.864 --> 11:39.733
I'm done. I'm never shooting
a scene with you again!

11:39.767 --> 11:41.869
Not if I never shoot a
scene with you again first!

11:41.902 --> 11:44.371
(Alejandro meows)
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Talk about an epic catfight.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.773
It is obvious what
has to happen.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.508
Excuse me?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.878
For once, I agree

11:50.911 --> 11:52.746
with the talentless hack!

11:52.780 --> 11:54.114
The editors can make it work.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.383
There are all kinds of tricks
you can do with doubles.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.020
So, is it done?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.354
Beautiful doctor, not yet.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.890
Petra still saying no to sign.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.892
So step up your game.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.894
I need the hotel sold.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.762
Y-Yes, Dr. Luisa.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.197
I call her again.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.466
(phone ringing)

12:13.500 --> 12:15.435
(phone clicks)

12:17.104 --> 12:18.772
(knocks on wall)
Hello, darling.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.774
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes.I'm sure you remember

12:20.808 --> 12:23.176
our old friend Chuck Chesser.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.315
I'm here with a proposition.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.383
Oh.
A business proposition.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.552
Eh. That's too bad.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.255
A good one.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.257
I'm putting together
a silent investment group

12:37.290 --> 12:39.860
to purchase two-thirds
of the Marbella.

12:39.893 --> 12:43.063
What I need is a public face,
so Luisa doesn't get suspicious

12:43.096 --> 12:44.397
and realize
we're behind it.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.399
Only an idiot
would turn that down, Chuck.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.935
If the sale goes through,

12:47.968 --> 12:50.537
you basically get ten percent
for doing nothing.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.180
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Depends if you ask Fun Jane...

13:00.213 --> 13:02.082
Wild night out.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.416
What, what?!
(laughs)

13:03.450 --> 13:04.818
...or Mom Jane.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.086
Absolutely not.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.355
What if we come home
wasted and Mateo needs us?

13:08.388 --> 13:11.925
And Alejandro is the ugliest
kitten I have ever seen!

13:11.959 --> 13:14.294
Uh, bad time?

13:14.327 --> 13:17.297
Of course not. I always have
time for my beloved daughter.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.465
Aw, thanks, Dad.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.833
Just make it snappy,
I have ten minutes.

13:19.867 --> 13:20.934
Right. So, the
short version.

13:20.968 --> 13:24.471
I found a great Catholic school
with one spot left.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.605
It'd be perfect for Mateo.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.841
It's just the cost.

13:27.875 --> 13:31.111
Say no more. I will pay for
everything your heart desires.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.546
In the near to long-term future.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.215
I'm not following.

13:35.248 --> 13:40.387
Well, I'm having a few
very trendy financial issues.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.122
It's possible
that I overspent

13:42.155 --> 13:43.957
a bit these past few years,

13:43.991 --> 13:46.226
so I'm tracking
Johnny Depp's lawsuit

13:46.259 --> 13:49.296
against his business managers
to see how that plays out.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.864
If Johnny loses,

13:50.898 --> 13:52.132
I know it's my fault
that I bought

13:52.165 --> 13:53.333
that time-share in Cancún

13:53.366 --> 13:55.035
and part of that vineyard,

13:55.068 --> 13:57.637
after my business managers
warned me not to.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.139
But if Johnny wins,
then I can sue them

13:59.172 --> 14:01.341
for my own financial negligence,

14:01.374 --> 14:04.011
and I am back in the game, baby.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.247
Got it. Don't worry,
I'll find the $8,000.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.348
Wait.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.884
Only $8,000?

14:10.918 --> 14:12.019
Why didn't you say so?

14:12.052 --> 14:13.954
That's less than I spent

14:13.987 --> 14:17.090
to shoot Ricardo Montalbán's
ashes into space.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.159
You can swing that?
Well, of course.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.661
JANE:
This is a deal of a lifetime.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.430
I'm telling you, you'd be crazy
not to get in on it.

14:23.463 --> 14:27.901
This is a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.669
Sorry, you know how I
feel about Catholicism.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.206
All that doom and gloom stuff,
it's not what I believe in.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.208
Well, do you believe
in a great education?

14:35.242 --> 14:36.109
(sighs)

14:36.143 --> 14:37.911
All my teeth are brushed.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.212
Can you please tickle my back?
Please, please, please?

14:39.246 --> 14:41.148
Yes. Come on.
Sure.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.505
*

15:32.565 --> 15:35.135
Ow, can you guys
tickle less hard?

15:44.377 --> 15:49.682
"Darci's Surefire Strategy
to Spotting Your Soul Mate"?

15:52.085 --> 15:54.287
Thought it could help me figure
out what to about Adam.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.991
I'm ditching the quizzes,
and I'm going over there

15:58.025 --> 16:00.027
and having a mature,
adult conversation.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.633
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ouch.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.302
Alba is definitely not
ride-or-die for Adam.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.005
Abuela, don't be such a downer.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.045
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh! I think it's time
to see Alba's alter ego.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.648
Can you spot
the seven differences?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.200
Fun Alba has spoken.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.668
What a surprise.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.171
She agrees with Alba.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.312
We happen to be fighting

16:52.345 --> 16:53.713
over sending Mateo
to Catholic school,

16:53.746 --> 16:55.382
so you should be
on my side here.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.349
Hmm.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.551
Yeah-- actually,

16:58.585 --> 17:00.687
now that you two are besties,

17:00.720 --> 17:04.357
maybe you can talk to him
about Our Lady of Mercy.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.393
Huh? Maybe between
the kettlebell swings

17:06.426 --> 17:08.095
and the Fitbit competitions,

17:08.128 --> 17:09.196
you can convince him
it's a good idea.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.367
Thanks, Abuela.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.835
You know what?

17:15.868 --> 17:17.737
I am tired of being
trapped in my own home

17:17.770 --> 17:19.406
during mature chat time.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.707
I'm going in.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.742
Uh...
Yeah. Mm-mm. I am.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.577
And I acknowledge your concern.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.347
But on the other hand, the fact
that I was involved with Chuck

17:27.380 --> 17:28.681
makes him an ideal front man.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.117
Anezka and Luisa
would never think

17:30.150 --> 17:31.084
I'd be in business with him.

17:31.118 --> 17:34.087
And I acknowledge your point,

17:34.121 --> 17:35.755
but Chuck still
has feelings for you,

17:35.788 --> 17:38.091
and that makes me uncomfortable.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.592
You think I'm comfortable
with you living with Jane?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.128
Remember:

17:41.161 --> 17:42.595
she tried to get
in the shower with you.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.865
RAFAEL: I hear you,
but for the millionth time,

17:45.898 --> 17:47.534
I don't have feelings for Jane.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.437
Me neither, just to be clear.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.540
Regardless,
Jane can't buy a hotel.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.542
So you can't unilaterally
rule out Chuck

17:55.575 --> 17:57.277
without providing
a viable alternative.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.545
Look, Anezka's
driving me crazy.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.247
I can't take much more.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.614
I understand.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.083
And I just happen
to have a great lead.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.387
Katherine Cortes.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.289
Carlos Cortes' daughter?

18:09.322 --> 18:11.124
The hotelier?
Mm-hmm.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.293
Well, why didn't you tell me
about her in the first place?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.228
Because we've been working
on communicating better,

18:15.262 --> 18:16.629
and I wanted
to give you a chance

18:16.663 --> 18:19.166
to process your feelings
about Chuck.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.601
Oh.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.603
Thank you for that.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.172
Yes.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.105
Call her.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.574
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Is it just me,

18:27.607 --> 18:29.609
or is all this communicating

18:29.642 --> 18:30.810
making them a little dull?

18:30.843 --> 18:33.180
Now that's more like it.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.115
What do you want to do tonight?

18:36.149 --> 18:38.918
Ooh, make out
and tequila poppers.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.320
Absolutely not.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.754
We're having a
serious discussion

18:41.788 --> 18:43.790
about whether this
relationship has legs.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.492
Which it doesn't.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.461
Why you looking confused?

18:48.495 --> 18:50.830
I'm sorry. It's just...

18:50.863 --> 18:52.299
This big decision.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.301
I'm a little
in my head about it.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.336
Buzzkill.
Shh.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.437
We need to know
if Adam is capable

18:57.470 --> 18:59.339
of a mature, adult relationship.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.607
Know what I do when
I have a lot on my mind?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.775
Hmm?
Roofball.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.178
And I think we
have our answer.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.346
ADAM:
Okay, here we go.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.181
Roofball. You score

19:08.215 --> 19:10.483
in the big trash can,
or the little trash can,

19:10.517 --> 19:13.186
or the flower pot
that's covered in bird crap.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.455
And do not fall off the roof.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.523
Has that ever happened?

19:16.556 --> 19:17.857
Many, many times.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.693
I am going to crush this.

19:20.727 --> 19:25.198
Okay. We're playing for
exactly eight minutes,

19:25.232 --> 19:27.667
and then we're telling him to
take the job and "good luck."

19:27.700 --> 19:29.702
Ready?
Okay.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.341
Okay. That's, uh, that's
one point for me.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.875
You got to try to block me.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.244
Oh, okay. Okay.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.446
Okay, okay. Now
you're getting it.

19:40.713 --> 19:41.414
(both grunting)

19:43.550 --> 19:45.218
Nice!
Oh!

19:45.252 --> 19:47.220
(laughing):
Nice!
Okay, I got this.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.321
You got this fast.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.522
Wow. Okay, cool.
Yeah.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.224
Hey, hey, hey...

19:51.258 --> 19:53.560
Oh! Oh!
No.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.794
(laughs)

19:58.465 --> 19:59.732
(grunts)
Oh.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.401
Where'd it go?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.470
Where'd it go, where'd it go?
(laughs)

20:09.576 --> 20:10.677
(shouts)

20:10.710 --> 20:12.845
Oh! Three points!

20:12.879 --> 20:14.714
Bring it, bitches!

20:14.747 --> 20:16.249
Our eight minutes are up.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.151
Ow!

20:19.185 --> 20:21.588
ROGELIO: Well, this is just
a slap to the face.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.022
WOMAN:
I'm sorry the editors

20:23.055 --> 20:25.024
couldn't make
the doubles thing work.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.394
But they did put together
something

20:27.427 --> 20:29.496
we're really excited about.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.774
(both gasp)
Oldest trick in the book.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.876
Kill someone off
to juice the ratings.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.778
And since the two of you
can't work together...

20:46.913 --> 20:48.315
The new plot

20:48.348 --> 20:49.316
will involve the lady scientist

20:49.349 --> 20:51.951
accidentally swallowing
Guillermo and Hector,

20:51.984 --> 20:53.453
but only one of you
will survive the journey

20:53.486 --> 20:55.288
out of her tush alive.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.590
We're putting your characters
to a focus group

20:57.624 --> 20:59.759
of women ages 34 to 55--

20:59.792 --> 21:01.794
bored housewives,
our bread and butter--

21:01.828 --> 21:03.296
they'll make the call.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.631
JANE:
Yes!

21:04.664 --> 21:06.599
I just have
so much fun with you.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.436
Mm. That's a good thing, right?

21:09.469 --> 21:11.304
Definitely.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.473
It's good to remember
that I'm young, you know?

21:13.506 --> 21:14.974
More than just a mom.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.476
Mm-hmm.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.484
(sighs)

21:26.853 --> 21:28.488
Let's have sex.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.491
Yeah? You ready?

21:31.524 --> 21:32.525
Mm-hmm.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.598
(loud pop, air hissing)

21:38.631 --> 21:39.599
(both grunt)

21:39.632 --> 21:41.434
(laughs)

21:41.468 --> 21:42.802
Not a lot of
inflatable swan sex?

21:42.835 --> 21:44.003
Not as much
as you'd think.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.838
Oh.
Let's go inside.

21:45.872 --> 21:46.839
(grunts)

21:49.809 --> 21:51.344
Oh.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.380
Usually when this happens,
I just jump down, but...

21:53.413 --> 21:54.981
I can jump.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.450
Do I have to remind you
that I am young and fun?

21:57.484 --> 21:59.786
Let's do this.
Mm-hmm.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.020
(laughs)

22:01.053 --> 22:02.422
(sighs)

22:09.061 --> 22:10.697
(sighing)

22:11.864 --> 22:13.032
Here I come.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.200
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

22:14.233 --> 22:18.805
in that moment,
Jane had never felt so free.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.139
(groans)

22:20.172 --> 22:21.808
(sobbing loudly)

22:21.841 --> 22:23.976
Do you think it's broken?

22:24.010 --> 22:27.580
Of course it's
broken, you idiot!

22:33.620 --> 22:34.721
So, a simple fracture of
the distal fibula usually takes

22:34.754 --> 22:36.489
four to six weeks
of recovery.

22:36.523 --> 22:39.392
Now, the pain meds will kick in
soon, so she'll be tired.

22:39.426 --> 22:42.429
She'll also need help in the
shower; the cast can't get wet.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.497
He can't give me a shower.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.998
We haven't even had sex yet.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.401
Wait.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.002
Can we even have sex?

22:50.036 --> 22:53.072
It's, uh, possible.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.206
Which positions?

22:54.240 --> 22:56.409
I think those are the meds
that you were talking about.

22:56.443 --> 22:59.078
You'll need to do the driving
for the next month.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.713
He may not even be here
in a month.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.014
He got a job in California.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.585
It's very exciting for him
and very confusing for me.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.819
Congratulations.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.456
Uh, someone will be by with
the discharge papers shortly.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.493
(sighs)

23:14.894 --> 23:16.062
(sighs)

23:16.095 --> 23:17.897
Hey, look.

23:17.930 --> 23:21.100
I can tell that my question's
really stressing you out.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.570
What? You have me
confused for Mom Jane.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.606
I am Fun Jane.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.476
Stay, go, whatevs.
I'm cool.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.077
Still, I'm taking the decision
off your plate.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.078
I got this.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.746
(chuckles):
Oh.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.747
(chuckles)

23:34.781 --> 23:37.484
You're so sweet.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.719
Oh, I think those drugs
are kicking in.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.654
Mm. (chuckles)

23:44.757 --> 23:46.659
(sighing)

23:53.633 --> 23:55.101
Oh, no.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.969
Sorry, you passed out there.
I couldn't move you.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.138
No, I'm late for my meeting
at Our Lady of Mercy.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.473
What's Our Lady of Mercy?

24:00.507 --> 24:01.774
Uh, it's a Catholic school
for Mateo.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.477
I was supposed to meet
with them today. Ow! Oh!

24:04.511 --> 24:05.912
(sobbing)

24:05.945 --> 24:07.547
Ooh. Oh, could you
pass me my pants?

24:11.017 --> 24:12.519
Hi. This is Jane Villanueva.

24:12.552 --> 24:16.455
Um, I had an appointment,
um... two hours ago.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.659
What?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.761
Y-You gave the slot away?

24:21.794 --> 24:24.163
RAFAEL:
I am so glad this worked out.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.165
I know how
busy you are.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.634
So let me
just say this.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.636
This is easy money.

24:29.669 --> 24:32.772
You'd clear ten percent without
putting in a dime of your own.

24:32.805 --> 24:36.709
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Mm, looks like Katherine
wants to tag his dinosaur.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.281
I still can't believe
that we never met.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.517
I've heard so much
about you from Chase.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.686
He and my ex-husband
are golf buddies.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.621
(phone chimes)

24:52.592 --> 24:53.693
I'm sorry, it's about my kids.

24:53.726 --> 24:54.761
Of course.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.797
Thank God my ex and I
never had kids.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.732
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
We get it, lady, you're single.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.674
So, let's discuss things
further, over drinks.

25:07.707 --> 25:08.875
XIOMARA:
Water with lemon.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.677
About time.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.812
You know it's not good
for the baby to be dehydrated.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.714
Were you working?

25:14.747 --> 25:16.182
Just checking a few e-mails.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.019
These aren't e-mails.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.588
This is a
dating profile.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.189
Wait.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.591
This is for you?

25:24.624 --> 25:25.692
Why are you

25:25.725 --> 25:27.326
posting a profile?

25:27.359 --> 25:29.729
Why do you think?

25:29.762 --> 25:31.731
I don't want to
raise this baby alone.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.065
Alone?

25:33.933 --> 25:34.867
(scoffs)

25:35.968 --> 25:37.604
Put this on.

25:37.637 --> 25:38.404
I'm about to yell,

25:38.437 --> 25:39.872
and I don't want
to hurt the baby.

25:41.941 --> 25:45.344
Doing this alone?!

25:45.377 --> 25:47.346
We brought you into our home!

25:47.379 --> 25:49.248
We wait on you hand and foot,

25:49.281 --> 25:50.917
take you to your
doctor's appointments.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.620
In fact, my husband
is on set right now

25:53.653 --> 25:56.255
building you a nursery--
a surprise nursery--

25:56.288 --> 25:58.758
so you know you won't be
doing this on your own.

25:58.791 --> 26:01.227
So what?
That's all stuff for the baby.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.262
Neither of you would have
anything to do with me

26:03.295 --> 26:04.263
if I weren't pregnant.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.765
Of course not.

26:05.798 --> 26:06.933
But you are.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.635
So we're stuck

26:08.668 --> 26:09.769
together forever.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.103
That's called family.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.772
And we're trying.

26:12.805 --> 26:13.840
You're the one who's not.

26:16.275 --> 26:17.944
worry less about
getting dehydrated

26:17.977 --> 26:20.379
and more about getting along
with her father.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.715
And you could be
a little nicer to me, too.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.218
ROGELIO:
Pick me.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.754
Choose me.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.656
Love me.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.223
(woman speaking Spanish)

26:31.257 --> 26:33.893
Why do you look
so worried, Papa?

26:33.926 --> 26:36.929
Well, because these women
are deciding if Papa

26:36.963 --> 26:40.132
or a terrible ogre will
stay on the telenovela.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.734
Let's listen in, Matelio.

26:50.843 --> 26:51.944
Sell it,

26:51.978 --> 26:52.879
woman with
the lazy eye.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.121
(sighs)

27:02.154 --> 27:03.656
Jane, what happened?

27:03.690 --> 27:06.793
No big deal, just
a small fracture.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.761
Hey.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.329
What's Fabian's grandma
doing in there?

27:12.832 --> 27:14.701
(Rogelio gasps)

27:14.734 --> 27:15.968
Oh, my God.

27:16.002 --> 27:18.705
That floozy has infiltrated
the focus group.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.974
Well, the jig is up, Granny.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.109
Uh...

27:23.142 --> 27:25.177
Uh, w-wait, wait, wait!
Think.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.312
How is it gonna look

27:28.047 --> 27:29.682
You're right.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.952
I have a better plan.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.155
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which,
my friends, brings us here.

27:49.769 --> 27:53.072
Yup.Meet Rogelio's
new alter ego.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.304
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Whoa there, granny.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.811
PETRA:
I'm uncomfortable.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.413
Because it's obvious that
Katherine is looking for

29:07.446 --> 29:09.415
a hookup with you in
exchange for signing on.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.918
And I acknowledge your feelings.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.921
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, man, I'm sick of mature
Rafael and Petra, too.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.889
But you have nothing
to worry about,

29:16.923 --> 29:18.490
because I can handle Katherine.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.426
Just like I can
handle Chuck.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.262
He's the logical
choice, a known entity.

29:23.295 --> 29:26.265
You working with Chuck
makes me uncomfortable,

29:26.298 --> 29:28.434
because I have
no interest in Katherine.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.437
You and Chuck have
a romantic history.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.506
How many more times and
ways can I explain to you

29:34.540 --> 29:36.342
that I don't want
to be with him?

29:36.375 --> 29:37.343
I know you don't.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.577
But you've
gone there before.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.212
Slept with men
to advance your interests.

29:42.514 --> 29:46.585
Whereas I haven't
crossed that line.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.822
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And
speaking of crossing a line.

29:49.856 --> 29:52.024
(women giggling,
chattering in Spanish)

29:52.058 --> 29:54.160
Ciao.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.902
(phone ringing)

30:02.935 --> 30:03.936
(ringtone playing)

30:08.941 --> 30:10.609
Hello.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.412
The focus group chose me?

30:16.248 --> 30:17.816
*

30:25.524 --> 30:28.127
Say hello to your abuela for me.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.929
And stay away
from my daughter!

30:40.239 --> 30:42.641
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.843
*

30:54.153 --> 30:57.456
Who knew comic books
could be so romantic?

31:04.530 --> 31:06.498
I know.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.067
I'm getting misty, too.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.001
(door closes)

31:12.571 --> 31:15.174
It's just a minor fracture.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.342
I was playing roofball

31:16.375 --> 31:17.944
with Adam.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.345
Uh, roofball?

31:19.378 --> 31:20.046
Mm-hmm.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.915
As in playing ball on a roof?

31:24.450 --> 31:25.284
Are you gonna be okay?

31:25.317 --> 31:27.119
Yeah.

31:27.153 --> 31:30.957
But we need to talk about
Mateo's school situation.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.391
Because of my accident,

31:32.424 --> 31:35.061
I missed the appointment
for Our Lady of Mercy,

31:35.094 --> 31:38.030
and now we don't even have
the option of Catholic school.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.932
Can you not smile?

31:39.966 --> 31:41.067
That was the best option we had.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.969
I have another one.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.071
Did you know
that your parents live

31:45.104 --> 31:46.372
in the Elbamare School District?

31:46.405 --> 31:48.140
It's a great
public school

31:48.174 --> 31:51.577
with a nine rating,
plus music, art, TK.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.246
We can enroll Mateo next year
using their address.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.348
And lie about where we live?

31:57.749 --> 32:00.052
Of course.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.955
Of course your option is to lie.
Why am I surprised?

32:02.989 --> 32:04.490
That's not fair.
But it's true.

32:04.523 --> 32:07.026
I mean, that's what you do.
You try to game the system.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.027
Why wouldn't you?

32:08.060 --> 32:09.661
You grew up rich and entitled,

32:09.695 --> 32:11.730
and you think that the rules
don't apply to you.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.099
It was your grandmother's idea.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.134
Yeah.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.403
So as you're climbing
off your high horse,

32:17.436 --> 32:19.271
try not to break your other leg.

32:21.207 --> 32:24.076
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, hello, Douche Jane.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.751
I don't understand. You told
Rafael that we should lie

32:32.784 --> 32:34.120
to get Mateo
into a better school?

32:36.322 --> 32:37.623
What?

32:49.501 --> 32:51.037
You used
somebody else's address?

33:15.627 --> 33:17.229
DR. GHAZALI:
Back to real life for you.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.665
No more excuses to lie
around getting spoiled.

33:19.698 --> 33:20.732
You are officially
off of bed rest.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.234
Hallelujah!

33:22.268 --> 33:24.070
Oh, thank God.
I'll see you next week.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.342
(sighs)

33:30.376 --> 33:32.178
So before you drop me off?

33:32.211 --> 33:33.479
Yes?

33:33.512 --> 33:35.347
Let's go see
that freakin' nursery.

33:35.381 --> 33:36.348
Really?

33:36.382 --> 33:37.816
But nobody better rub my belly

33:37.849 --> 33:39.351
when I'm there; I'm not
friggin' public property.

33:39.385 --> 33:43.122
I think that look on your face
will scare them off.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.160
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I think that's a smile?

33:48.194 --> 33:52.431
I would have gone with a less
tacky mobile, but it's nice.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.066
(sighs)

33:54.100 --> 33:54.833
I'll take it.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.702
Thank you, Rogelio.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.504
You're welcome.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.707
And I swear I will not put
work first when the baby comes.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.176
I want to be
a good co-parent with you.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.545
I know.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.514
We had
a friendship once.

34:08.547 --> 34:12.218
Long, long, long ago.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.452
Can we again?

34:13.485 --> 34:15.187
Let's try.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.461
Now I have something
to show you, too.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.099
Welcome to your relaxation room.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.101
Your lady cave.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.572
Rogelio.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.241
What's this for?

34:35.274 --> 34:39.178
Well, I spent some time
with some women today.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.212
In a focus group.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.380
And I learned that

34:41.413 --> 34:44.116
sometimes women feel
underappreciated.

34:44.150 --> 34:47.853
And sometimes it's nice
to have a room of one's own.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.489
I know you're
going through a lot

34:50.522 --> 34:54.260
with Darci, the baby,
the dance studio.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.594
So whenever
you want to decompress,

34:55.627 --> 34:57.129
this is the place.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.265
This is so sweet.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.267
And thoughtful.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.901
My ladies group taught me
that sometimes it's nice

35:02.934 --> 35:05.271
to do things
without being asked.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.273
They did, huh?

35:10.509 --> 35:12.744
(moans)

35:12.778 --> 35:14.346
That's not all they taught me.

35:16.482 --> 35:20.152
I guess I realized that
I was the one who was spoiled.

35:20.186 --> 35:23.355
I took you...

35:23.389 --> 35:25.924
and your money for granted.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.593
And I'm sorry.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.461
It's okay.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.163
It's not.

35:32.831 --> 35:35.467
Look, I...

35:35.501 --> 35:39.438
I-I don't want
to fight anymore.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.440
Can we be friends again?

35:41.473 --> 35:43.875
I'd like that.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.611
Me, too.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.678
And I mean that.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.817
has been huge.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.320
And parenting without it
is gonna be harder

35:54.353 --> 35:57.189
and lead to making
harder choices.

35:59.225 --> 36:02.361
And so, let's do it.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.296
Use my parents' address.
(chuckles)

36:06.398 --> 36:07.366
Don't worry.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.368
It won't be for long.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.470
'Cause I'm gonna
get it all back.

36:11.503 --> 36:15.507
The money, the hotel,
everything.

36:15.541 --> 36:18.210
Okay.

36:18.244 --> 36:22.414
But until then, the family is
gonna need to make some changes.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.850
Buckle down a little, grow up.

36:24.883 --> 36:26.685
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.354
You have to take the job.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.856
But I've already decided
that I'm staying.

36:30.889 --> 36:33.692
Well, you shouldn't,
not if I'm part of the equation,

36:33.725 --> 36:37.396
because honestly... I don't
think that we'll work long-term.

36:37.429 --> 36:38.196
What are you talking about?

36:38.230 --> 36:38.864
These past few weeks
have been...

36:38.897 --> 36:41.867
Amazing. But not real life.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.369
And it's come
with a cost.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.670
I mean, Mateo may not have

36:44.703 --> 36:46.238
anywhere to go to school
next year.

36:46.272 --> 36:47.373
And I can't drive for a month.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.540
Jane.
And this.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.008
This, this...

36:50.041 --> 36:53.011
is incredibly sweet.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.447
But it's a fantasy.

36:55.481 --> 36:58.016
In reality, these panels
would be lice checks,

36:58.049 --> 37:00.552
and Mateo puking and
getting in trouble at school,

37:00.586 --> 37:02.554
and you texting me
that you'll be home late,

37:02.588 --> 37:05.023
but I don't get it
because I already fell asleep,

37:05.056 --> 37:06.858
and a lot of other
not-fun things.

37:06.892 --> 37:07.993
I know you have a kid, Jane.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.729
And I know that makes everything
way more complicated.

37:10.762 --> 37:13.632
But just like the school
meeting, if I'd known about it,

37:13.665 --> 37:16.268
I-I would've set my alarm,

37:16.302 --> 37:18.704
I-I would've dragged
your ass out of bed.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.406
You're the one
compartmentalizing.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.441
Because you can't meet
Mateo yet-- it's too early--

37:22.474 --> 37:23.275
and without you meeting him,

37:23.309 --> 37:24.910
I don't know
how you fit in my life.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.346
That's exactly my point.
You can't know.

37:27.379 --> 37:28.146
Then why did you ask me to make

37:28.179 --> 37:29.315
this huge decision
about your job?

37:31.350 --> 37:33.051
I-I was just asking you
if you wanted me to stay.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.322
Of course I want you to stay!
Okay, well, then I'm staying!

37:38.324 --> 37:40.392
I'm staying.

37:40.426 --> 37:43.295
I'm gonna need you to kiss me.

37:45.897 --> 37:46.998
What are you doing?

37:47.032 --> 37:48.934
Making you work for it.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.303
(laughs)

37:51.337 --> 37:52.871
(laughs):
Yeah.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.375
(moans)

37:56.408 --> 37:57.376
(door opens)

37:57.409 --> 37:58.877
PETRA:
Rafael?

38:00.812 --> 38:01.947
(door closes)

38:01.980 --> 38:04.082
Thought we could use
a little romance.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.352
Which we were not gonna get
at Jane's house.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.319
(chuckles softly)

38:10.121 --> 38:12.591
Yeah, I've been thinking.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.461
And you're right.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.463
I should trust you.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.465
Let's go with Chuck.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.799
No.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.968
You want to go with Katherine?

38:23.001 --> 38:24.470
Neither.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.973
I'm serious.

38:28.006 --> 38:31.377
I've decided I can deal
with Anezka long enough

38:31.410 --> 38:34.346
for us to find
the right investor,

38:34.380 --> 38:35.614
someone with no strings.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.483
I can handle Katherine.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.117
Okay? I am not gonna
sleep with her.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.419
I'm not that person.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.358
But there'll always be
a part of you that thinks I am.

38:46.392 --> 38:48.994
What?

38:49.027 --> 38:51.830
It's true.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.799
And I don't blame you.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.534
I've cheated.

38:57.803 --> 39:01.006
But at the same time...

39:01.039 --> 39:03.442
that's not who I am.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.412
And I need a fresh start.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.414
What kind of fresh start?

39:08.447 --> 39:10.749
Romantically.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.018
Are you breaking up with me?

39:13.051 --> 39:15.086
We just decided
to be mature and try.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.023
And we have been.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.158
But I'm just tired
of the effort, frankly.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.027
And it's not what I want.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.931
Then why did you get
back together with me?

39:25.964 --> 39:27.533
I'm not completely sure.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.034
I shouldn't have.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.702
(scoffs)

39:30.736 --> 39:32.170
Maybe you just
chose Jane so many times

39:32.203 --> 39:34.473
that when you finally chose me,
I didn't want to say no.

39:36.074 --> 39:38.877
Or maybe I just needed to be
the one to end it.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.546
Well, I'm happy to help you

39:40.579 --> 39:42.180
on your journey
of self-empowerment.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.715
I'm sorry, Rafael.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.383
Just go!

39:54.760 --> 39:56.862
Even the stench of his
mediocrity is gone.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.197
It feels amazing to
have my set back.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.901
I will never have to see Fabian
and his deformed kitten again.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.570
(chuckles)
Oh, thank you.

40:04.603 --> 40:07.506
It's great to be number
one on the call sheet.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.475
Well, co-number one.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.978
(gasps)

40:13.011 --> 40:14.513
No, this can't be.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.047
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But it is.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.049
(man laughing)

40:18.083 --> 40:20.418
Wow.

40:22.788 --> 40:23.455
(gasps)

40:23.489 --> 40:24.923
I was just seeing where I sit.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.124
For when I win.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.894
How funny. I was just seeing
where I sit for when I win.

40:28.927 --> 40:29.928
Well, we can't both win.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.630
Dang it!

40:31.663 --> 40:32.631
Cut!

40:32.664 --> 40:33.932
(gasps)

40:35.834 --> 40:37.469
Where's Fabian?

40:37.503 --> 40:40.772
Get that delusional has-been
back here this instant!

40:40.806 --> 40:42.908
This is my
worst nightmare.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.644
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It's actually about to get
a whole lot worse.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.513
(laughs)

40:47.546 --> 40:48.747
Stop it.

40:48.780 --> 40:49.948
Whoa, why are
they talking?

40:49.981 --> 40:51.483
Why-why is she
laughing like that?

40:51.517 --> 40:53.251
XIOMARA:
Oh, God.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.555
I think... he likes her?

40:56.588 --> 40:57.789
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ya think?

40:57.823 --> 40:59.691
*

40:59.725 --> 41:03.595
From chemical attraction
to an indecent proposal.

41:03.629 --> 41:07.265
See? Isn't this nicer than
some crowded restaurant?

41:07.298 --> 41:08.967
It is.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.637
Wait. We have to toast
to working together.

41:13.872 --> 41:15.641
I just hope
we're compatible.

41:24.583 --> 41:27.152
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Say good-bye to Zen Rafael.

41:27.185 --> 41:28.554
PETRA:
You won't break me.

41:28.587 --> 41:29.988
I built this hotel,

41:30.021 --> 41:31.957
and nothing you can do
will make me give it up.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.225
Whatever you are saying,
beautiful sister.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.829
MAGDA:
Hello, Petra.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.165
That's right.

41:40.198 --> 41:43.802
Granny's back.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.236
