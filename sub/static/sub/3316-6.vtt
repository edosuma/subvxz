<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

00:05.439 --> 00:07.440
<i>You need to send
a car to Briarcliff.</i>

00:07.508 --> 00:08.908
<i>They're waiting.</i>
<i>Who's waiting?</i>

00:08.976 --> 00:10.810
<i>I've been a very busy boy.</i>

00:10.878 --> 00:13.479
<i>Can you give me your name?</i>

00:13.546 --> 00:14.916
Hello?

00:15.036 --> 00:16.920
<i>You'll know my name</i>
<i>when you see them.</i>

00:17.040 --> 00:18.137
<i>They were imposters.</i>

00:18.257 --> 00:19.253
Police.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.754
Anybody here?

00:30.361 --> 00:31.928
Jesus, Bobby.

00:31.996 --> 00:35.032
Holy shit.

01:50.973 --> 01:54.170
<i>I used to think
it must be my fault.</i>

01:55.358 --> 01:58.961
<i>My own child, who lived</i>
<i>inside me for nine months,</i>

01:59.081 --> 02:03.176
<i>someone I nursed and bathed</i>
<i>and held and sang lullabies to.</i>

02:05.007 --> 02:06.629
I have two other children, Sister,

02:06.749 --> 02:08.901
both of them perfectly normal.

02:08.970 --> 02:12.133
She sounds like quite a handful,
Mrs. Reynolds,

02:12.201 --> 02:14.599
<i>but we do not have</i>
<i>a children's ward here.</i>

02:14.667 --> 02:16.564
<i>Oh, but she's
more than a child, Sister.</i>

02:16.632 --> 02:18.727
In fact, that's the problem.

02:18.795 --> 02:20.127
She's always seemed like an adult.

02:20.194 --> 02:21.858
Do you know that she's never cried?

02:21.926 --> 02:24.090
Not once, not even
when she was a little baby.

02:24.158 --> 02:25.490
I'm going to tell you something

02:25.557 --> 02:27.354
I haven't told anyone.

02:27.422 --> 02:28.752
<i>Jenny and her little friend, Josie,</i>

02:28.820 --> 02:30.717
<i>were playing after school.</i>

02:30.785 --> 02:33.683
<i>I had told them to go out into</i>
<i>the woods to gather leaves.</i>

02:33.749 --> 02:35.712
<i>We were gonna make a fall wreath.</i>

02:35.780 --> 02:37.944
See, Josie was the only one
who would play with Jenny,

02:38.012 --> 02:39.344
and I wanted it to go well.

02:41.343 --> 02:44.972
I tried to stop him,
but he was bigger than me,

02:45.040 --> 02:48.503
and he said he would kill me, too,

02:48.571 --> 02:50.867
if I didn't stand very
still and be quiet.

02:50.934 --> 02:55.064
He was tall, he had a
beard and a brown jacket.

02:56.696 --> 02:57.995
And they never found the bearded man

02:58.062 --> 02:59.528
with the brown coat, I take it?

02:59.595 --> 03:01.658
They searched.

03:01.725 --> 03:04.290
Two days ago, I was doing the laundry,

03:04.358 --> 03:07.422
and I found this in her pocket.

03:07.489 --> 03:09.087
I can't go to the police.

03:09.154 --> 03:11.552
Sister, I can't.
She's my daughter.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.050
Oh, Mrs. Reynolds...

03:13.118 --> 03:14.715
One of my dreams

03:14.783 --> 03:17.414
for Briarcliff has been to open

03:17.481 --> 03:19.546
a children's ward.

03:19.613 --> 03:21.411
There are so many

03:21.478 --> 03:24.442
little souls who could use our help.

03:24.510 --> 03:27.806
But we can do nothing until that time.

03:29.106 --> 03:31.004
Prayer...

03:31.071 --> 03:33.901
is your strength and your ally.

03:33.968 --> 03:35.933
Could you just meet with her?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.831
She's right downstairs
with her coloring book.

03:37.898 --> 03:40.430
Sister, just help me understand,

03:40.498 --> 03:42.794
where does this evil come from?

03:42.861 --> 03:45.226
Could she have been born that way?

04:21.228 --> 04:22.659
Is there
anything more heavenly

04:22.727 --> 04:24.326
than waking from a nap

04:24.393 --> 04:25.657
to the smell of
croque-monsieur?

04:30.423 --> 04:32.387
I bet this is what your mother made you

04:32.454 --> 04:33.784
after school on a rainy day.

04:40.148 --> 04:43.777
You can scream all you want.
No one will hear you.

04:43.845 --> 04:47.408
Obviously, the basement is soundproof.

04:47.476 --> 04:49.140
Believe me, girls with
bigger sets of lungs

04:49.208 --> 04:50.571
than yours have tried before.

04:54.270 --> 04:56.067
Where's Wendy?

04:58.467 --> 05:00.563
What did you do with her body?

05:00.630 --> 05:03.528
I put her somewhere where
she'll never be found.

05:03.596 --> 05:05.596
It wouldn't do to have her body pop up

05:05.664 --> 05:07.298
now that Kit Walker has confessed

05:07.366 --> 05:10.397
to all those horrendous murders.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.659
Can I tell you a secret?

05:16.525 --> 05:19.956
Nutmeg makes all the difference

05:20.024 --> 05:22.056
in the world.

05:30.950 --> 05:32.349
Croque-monsieur
and tomato soup.

05:35.779 --> 05:38.446
The perfect mommy snack.

05:38.514 --> 05:40.083
Only I didn't have

05:40.151 --> 05:42.124
a mother to make this for me.

05:43.494 --> 05:44.961
Well, of course,

05:45.029 --> 05:47.897
I had a mother, but I never knew her.

05:50.234 --> 05:53.837
She was about your age
when she abandoned me.

05:53.905 --> 05:56.406
You grew up in an orphanage?

05:56.474 --> 05:59.543
Yeah. In the system.

05:59.611 --> 06:02.613
Where all my basic needs were met:

06:02.681 --> 06:05.349
food, water,

06:05.417 --> 06:07.318
a rudimentary education.

06:07.386 --> 06:08.486
And with the help

06:08.553 --> 06:09.987
of a leather crop,

06:10.055 --> 06:13.190
learning the difference
between right and wrong.

06:13.257 --> 06:14.624
They followed all the rules.

06:14.692 --> 06:16.326
Especially the rules against affection

06:16.394 --> 06:19.963
or any unnecessary bodily contact,

06:20.031 --> 06:24.935
because touch would certainly
spoil the child.

06:29.340 --> 06:30.607
This is good.

06:30.675 --> 06:31.842
You're right.

06:33.178 --> 06:35.679
This is good.

06:35.747 --> 06:36.714
It's delicious.

06:38.250 --> 06:41.786
I'm not trying to patronize you, Oliver.

06:41.853 --> 06:44.555
I just want you to know

06:44.623 --> 06:47.692
how much I appreciate
this act of kindness.

06:50.429 --> 06:53.765
I know what it's like to be abandoned.

06:53.832 --> 06:56.635
That's how I felt at Briarcliff.

07:09.343 --> 07:10.944
I was right about you.

07:12.914 --> 07:14.982
You're the one.

07:24.858 --> 07:29.260
Lana, I've always
been self-aware.

07:29.328 --> 07:31.129
I knew I was different
from the other kids.

07:31.197 --> 07:32.931
I was smarter.

07:32.999 --> 07:36.201
But I was also more afflicted.

07:36.269 --> 07:39.538
It's what led me to study psychiatry...

07:39.605 --> 07:41.873
to better understand my disorder.

07:41.941 --> 07:43.708
It wasn't until medical school

07:43.776 --> 07:45.911
<i>that I had</i>
<i>my first breakthrough, though.</i>

07:47.881 --> 07:49.715
Hey, Thredson, from what I hear,

07:49.783 --> 07:51.951
this is the closest you'll get
to a girlfriend this quarter.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.357
<i>I would laugh along</i>
<i>with my idiot colleagues,</i>

07:57.424 --> 08:00.860
<i>but I knew the woman on the</i>
<i>table wasn't my girlfriend.</i>

08:00.928 --> 08:02.796
I trust you gentlemen
have reviewed the material

08:02.864 --> 08:04.531
in preparation for today.

08:04.598 --> 08:07.567
<i>She was my mother.</i>
<i>She was 33 years old,</i>

08:07.635 --> 08:10.203
<i>the same age as my mother</i>
<i>when she abandoned me.</i>

08:15.710 --> 08:18.446
The same age as you, Lana.

08:25.287 --> 08:29.061
<i>Now, I knew logically, rationally,</i>

08:29.181 --> 08:30.824
<i>that the woman on the table</i>
<i>wasn't my mother.</i>

08:30.892 --> 08:34.828
<i>But somehow, in the</i>
<i>cosmic joke that is my life,</i>

08:34.895 --> 08:37.063
<i>I felt like she could be.</i>

08:39.301 --> 08:42.669
<i>And it was poetic justice</i>
<i>that I would be meeting her</i>

08:42.736 --> 08:45.706
<i>for the first time on a slab</i>
<i>in my gross anatomy class.</i>

09:00.256 --> 09:04.226
<i>It was then that I knew</i>
<i>what I was missing.</i>

09:06.930 --> 09:08.624
A mother's touch.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.874
Skin-to-skin contact.

09:20.410 --> 09:22.945
<i>It's what I was craving.</i>

09:23.013 --> 09:27.017
<i>It's what I was missing my whole life.</i>

09:29.788 --> 09:33.725
<i>Oh, but she smelled of formaldehyde.</i>

09:39.998 --> 09:45.802
And her skin, even after I
removed it, was cold and stiff.

09:45.870 --> 09:48.772
Have you ever read

09:48.840 --> 09:51.075
or heard about the Harlow studies?

09:52.277 --> 09:53.777
Baby rhesus monkeys

09:53.845 --> 09:55.746
were separated
from their mothers after birth,

09:55.814 --> 09:58.483
and they were given
two substitute mothers:

09:58.550 --> 10:01.052
a wire mesh one with milk

10:01.119 --> 10:05.022
and the other covered in terrycloth.

10:05.090 --> 10:09.360
<i>Every</i> monkey preferred
the terrycloth-covered mother,

10:09.428 --> 10:11.529
even if it didn't have milk.

10:11.597 --> 10:13.731
Because of the warmth?

10:13.799 --> 10:14.932
Because of the skin.

10:17.836 --> 10:20.237
Even monkeys know the difference.

10:24.676 --> 10:28.011
I tried, I really tried.

10:32.782 --> 10:36.250
But that cadaver did nothing
to quiet my craving.

10:36.317 --> 10:38.251
I needed someone...

10:41.121 --> 10:43.189
...a little more lively.

11:12.888 --> 11:14.522
Warm living skin.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.627
No, no, no, no, no.

11:18.695 --> 11:20.763
It's okay.

11:20.831 --> 11:22.899
It's okay, because now that you're here,

11:22.966 --> 11:25.868
all of that work is behind me.

11:28.906 --> 11:30.741
Mommy.

11:37.315 --> 11:39.383
Hello?

11:39.451 --> 11:40.783
Sister Jude.

11:40.851 --> 11:43.016
It's Sam Goodman.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.816
Sam, I tried calling you,

11:44.884 --> 11:46.451
but you never got back to me.

11:46.519 --> 11:48.686
I was working on your case.

11:48.754 --> 11:51.956
Yes, but I-I-I asked you
to stop.

11:52.024 --> 11:53.257
I mean, this girl, this mental patient,

11:53.325 --> 11:54.859
she wasn't Anne Frank.

11:54.926 --> 11:58.095
I mean, she just made
the whole thing up.

11:58.162 --> 11:59.529
Well, somehow,

11:59.597 --> 12:00.997
she got it right.

12:01.065 --> 12:02.465
He is Hans Grouper.

12:02.533 --> 12:04.801
He was an SS officer and a physician...

12:04.868 --> 12:07.437
at Auschwitz.
What?

12:07.504 --> 12:10.173
Did you say...

12:10.241 --> 12:11.441
she got it right?

12:11.509 --> 12:12.642
After the liberation,

12:12.710 --> 12:14.943
he obtained a laissez-passer

12:15.011 --> 12:19.713
from the International Red Cross
under the name Arthur Arden.

12:21.349 --> 12:24.852
I have the original documents

12:24.919 --> 12:27.354
from the Red Cross,

12:27.422 --> 12:31.425
but I need Grouper's fingerprint
to establish a match.

12:31.492 --> 12:34.427
Be careful. The man is dangerous
and a flight risk.

12:35.996 --> 12:38.131
These men are always on their guard.

12:38.198 --> 12:40.032
The moment they get nervous,
they disappear.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.368
As soon as you have the print,

12:42.435 --> 12:45.704
bring it directly to the motel.

12:52.410 --> 12:54.143
Who are you?

12:54.211 --> 12:55.278
I'm Jenny.

12:56.580 --> 12:58.914
I told your mother,

12:58.982 --> 13:01.116
we don't have a children's ward here.

13:01.184 --> 13:02.484
Where is she?
She's gone.

13:02.552 --> 13:04.986
She kissed me on the cheek

13:05.054 --> 13:07.955
and said, "Be good, Jenny."

13:15.230 --> 13:16.863
Sister Mary Eunice!

13:16.931 --> 13:19.565
I need help here.

13:23.207 --> 13:24.640
Monsignor, thank you for coming.

13:24.708 --> 13:26.175
Oh, it's my pleasure.

13:26.243 --> 13:28.444
I consider it a privilege
to perform last rites.

13:28.512 --> 13:30.445
Oh, thank God you're
a man of compassion.

13:30.513 --> 13:32.113
We called several priests in the area,

13:32.180 --> 13:35.048
but they were all in a panic
over the news reports.

13:35.116 --> 13:38.385
Especially after they published
those grim pictures of her.

13:38.453 --> 13:39.853
What exactly is wrong with her?

13:39.921 --> 13:41.354
No one knows.

13:41.422 --> 13:44.357
Our doctors have ordered
a battery of tests.

13:44.425 --> 13:46.326
But she did test positive for TB.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.162
Oh, I didn't realize
there were still new cases.

13:49.230 --> 13:51.297
I should warn you...

13:51.365 --> 13:53.533
the sight of her is quite shocking.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.036
We're all God's creatures.

14:04.579 --> 14:06.981
I'll be in the hall if you need me.

14:09.684 --> 14:11.519
Hi, child.

14:28.104 --> 14:29.304
Shelly?

14:40.917 --> 14:43.667
Oh, look at that,

14:43.787 --> 14:44.772
Father James.

14:44.888 --> 14:47.023
This will make a splendid dayroom

14:47.090 --> 14:48.291
for our residents.

14:48.358 --> 14:51.060
All right, I thought all

14:51.128 --> 14:53.429
TB patients had been cleared out.

14:53.496 --> 14:54.997
These are
the incurables,

14:55.064 --> 14:57.366
those whose tuberculosis
was too far advanced

14:57.434 --> 14:58.834
for any of the new miracle drugs

14:58.902 --> 15:01.370
to have an effect.
God bless.

15:01.438 --> 15:05.174
Well, he hasn't yet.

15:05.242 --> 15:07.476
Dr. Arthur Arden,
Briarcliff's

15:07.544 --> 15:10.146
Tubercular Ward's supervising physician.

15:10.214 --> 15:12.649
Former supervising
physician, I should say.

15:12.716 --> 15:14.985
Father Timothy Howard...

15:15.052 --> 15:16.520
Yes, I know who you are.

15:16.587 --> 15:17.621
You're the new owner.

15:19.057 --> 15:20.991
Sally Starns.

15:21.058 --> 15:23.393
She was actually a
nurse here at one time.

15:23.461 --> 15:26.863
She won't live till morning,
not if she's lucky.

15:26.931 --> 15:28.464
Through this holy anointing,

15:28.532 --> 15:29.766
may the Lord and his love

15:29.834 --> 15:31.267
and mercy help you with the grace

15:31.335 --> 15:32.535
of the Holy Spirit.

15:34.272 --> 15:36.573
May the Lord who frees you from sin

15:36.641 --> 15:38.809
save you and raise you up.

15:38.877 --> 15:40.444
It's all right, my daughter.

15:40.512 --> 15:41.945
The Prince of Peace

15:42.013 --> 15:44.182
opens his arms to you.

15:48.488 --> 15:50.456
Back when the epidemic was at its worst,

15:50.524 --> 15:52.124
we'd sometimes move more than

15:52.192 --> 15:54.393
100 bodies a week down through here.
Oh.

15:54.461 --> 15:57.663
- How did you manage to keep up with
all the burials? - There were no burials.

15:57.731 --> 16:00.966
Most of the people here
have long since been forgotten.

16:01.034 --> 16:02.902
We incinerate the bodies

16:02.969 --> 16:05.371
in the crematorium out back

16:05.439 --> 16:07.640
and store the ashes in here.

16:07.708 --> 16:10.275
All these wasted lives.

16:10.343 --> 16:12.644
All these wasted opportunities.

16:12.712 --> 16:14.179
I suppose it will be a relief for you

16:14.247 --> 16:15.748
to finally leave this place.

16:15.815 --> 16:17.483
The end of my
tenure at Briarcliff

16:17.550 --> 16:19.485
also means the end of my research.

16:19.552 --> 16:21.520
Research?

16:21.588 --> 16:24.889
I've been working
on an immune booster.

16:24.957 --> 16:28.293
It's a sort of bacterial
cocktail, if you will.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.961
It would actually inhibit most disease

16:30.029 --> 16:32.297
from ever taking hold in the human body.

16:32.365 --> 16:34.566
What would you need
to further your work?

16:34.634 --> 16:36.636
Human trials would have
been the next step.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.372
I assume it would be difficult
to find volunteers.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.207
From the general public, yes.

16:41.275 --> 16:44.244
But there are those whose lives
otherwise serve no purpose.

16:44.311 --> 16:45.946
Through our work together,
they would have contributed

16:46.014 --> 16:47.214
to the greater good.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.953
A good that would not go unnoticed.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.121
Even in Rome.

17:25.520 --> 17:26.650
I'm sorry.

17:26.717 --> 17:28.584
Would you have preferred Mozart?

17:28.652 --> 17:30.286
Jude was right about you.

17:30.354 --> 17:31.253
You're a monster.

17:33.022 --> 17:34.889
Why do you look for the speck

17:34.957 --> 17:37.325
of sawdust in your brother's eye...

17:37.392 --> 17:40.560
and pay no attention
to the plank in your own?

17:40.628 --> 17:43.997
I saw that girl, what you did

17:44.064 --> 17:45.298
to Shelly.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.566
All in the name of progress.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.167
Isn't that what we agreed upon?

17:49.235 --> 17:51.602
No, you told me this
was for the greater good.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.104
You mutilated her!

17:53.171 --> 17:55.038
Perhaps.

17:55.106 --> 17:57.006
But you're missing the entire point.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.709
Briarcliff is a receptacle

18:00.777 --> 18:02.177
for human waste.

18:02.245 --> 18:04.813
Each patient a perfect example

18:04.881 --> 18:07.382
of an evolutionary failure.

18:12.755 --> 18:14.189
♪ Jesus... ♪

18:14.256 --> 18:16.256
Oh, yeah.

18:16.324 --> 18:18.263
♪ Loves me ♪

18:18.331 --> 18:20.299
Oh, yeah, that's it, that's it.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.568
Yeah, oh.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.605
Another mess to
clean up, Mr. Spivey?

18:27.673 --> 18:29.173
You seemed to have

18:29.241 --> 18:30.708
mistaken the broom closet
for the playground,

18:30.775 --> 18:32.009
where you used to expose yourself

18:32.076 --> 18:34.744
to innocent little boys and girls.

18:34.812 --> 18:35.878
No, never the boys, Doc.

18:35.946 --> 18:37.513
I had my standards.

18:37.581 --> 18:39.682
You are utterly depraved.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.818
You've done nothing to improve yourself.

18:41.886 --> 18:42.819
No, you're wrong, Doc.

18:42.887 --> 18:44.120
I'm a new man.

18:44.188 --> 18:46.723
I used to have these disgusting urges

18:46.790 --> 18:48.357
that wouldn't quit
until I busted a nut--

18:48.425 --> 18:50.292
I mean, even in public--
but I'm not sneaking around

18:50.360 --> 18:51.995
with my pants down anymore.

18:52.062 --> 18:53.563
It was Sister Mary Eunice that asked me

18:53.631 --> 18:55.599
to come watch her flash her pussy...

18:55.667 --> 18:58.802
My aim was to give
these wasted lives purpose,

18:58.870 --> 19:00.137
meaning,

19:00.205 --> 19:01.305
and I've succeeded

19:01.373 --> 19:03.474
beyond my wildest imagination.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.342
My experiments

19:05.410 --> 19:07.578
<i>with a combination of syphilis</i>
<i>and tuberculosis</i>

19:07.646 --> 19:12.083
<i>have produced results unseen in</i>
<i>the history of medical science.</i>

19:12.150 --> 19:15.285
When they arrived here, these
patients were less than men.

19:15.353 --> 19:16.554
Now, because of me,

19:16.621 --> 19:18.857
they're more than human.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.293
Would you care to see what

19:22.361 --> 19:24.262
your benevolence has produced?

19:31.704 --> 19:34.405
Witness the next stage
of human evolution.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.042
Have you lost your mind?

19:39.445 --> 19:41.412
Why on earth would you do this?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.414
Why?

19:43.481 --> 19:45.616
When the Russians launch
their nuclear missiles,

19:45.684 --> 19:49.253
20 million Americans will
be incinerated instantly.

19:49.321 --> 19:52.824
Another 20 million will suffer
a slow, agonizing death.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.759
Natural selection would have

19:54.827 --> 19:57.763
weeded out the weak, but only
over the course of time.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.933
Whereas I have managed
to improve the species now,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.202
so that we can survive the atomic blast,

20:03.269 --> 20:05.404
live through the radiation and become

20:05.472 --> 20:06.639
dominant once again.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.407
You should be locked away.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.942
With you to keep me company?

20:10.010 --> 20:11.410
We're in this together, Father.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.145
Remember?

20:13.213 --> 20:15.347
You gave me your blessing,
along with the facility

20:15.415 --> 20:16.815
and the subjects.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.283
I cannot allow this to continue.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.884
I have to expose this
to the light of day.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.652
If you do open that window,

20:21.720 --> 20:24.389
the light will illuminate
everything in Briarcliff.

20:24.456 --> 20:27.192
And I mean everything.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.433
Yes, that's what I thought.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.235
Now, you listen to me.

20:36.303 --> 20:38.471
You and I have nothing
to fear from each other.

20:38.538 --> 20:42.708
However, we do have a threat in common.

20:42.776 --> 20:46.245
We both know where the real danger lies.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.881
Can I try that?

20:48.949 --> 20:51.384
You're too young to use a knife.
You'll cut yourself.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.886
Why'd your mother
abandon you here anyway?

20:53.954 --> 20:56.322
She's scared of me.
Really?

20:56.390 --> 20:57.724
Why?

20:57.791 --> 20:59.792
She thinks I killed Josie.

20:59.860 --> 21:01.494
Did you?

21:01.562 --> 21:03.162
No.

21:03.230 --> 21:05.098
Did so.
How do you know?

21:05.165 --> 21:06.813
I know everything.

21:08.036 --> 21:08.969
I'm the devil.

21:12.111 --> 21:14.779
She deserved it, that Josie.

21:14.847 --> 21:16.848
She was a phony little shit.

21:16.915 --> 21:19.050
She didn't even like you.

21:19.118 --> 21:21.252
She just played with you
because her mother told her to.

21:23.388 --> 21:24.955
But you're lucky, because you were born

21:25.023 --> 21:28.029
with the gift of authentic impulse.

21:28.096 --> 21:29.430
Don't ever let them kill it.

21:29.498 --> 21:30.865
I wasted so much time

21:30.933 --> 21:32.033
trying to be a good girl.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.700
All I wanted in the whole world

21:33.768 --> 21:35.736
was for people to like me.

21:35.803 --> 21:39.106
<i>Okay, okay everyone, it's time!</i>

21:39.174 --> 21:42.209
Let's all welcome Mary Eunice McKee

21:42.277 --> 21:44.912
to our annual pool event.

21:47.295 --> 21:50.352
Hey, why don't you get up on
the diving board, Mary Eunice?

21:50.472 --> 21:52.720
You're our guest of honor today.

21:52.788 --> 21:55.856
♪ Love me... ♪
Go ahead.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.358
♪ But how do I know? ♪
♪ <i>Tell me</i> ♪

21:58.426 --> 22:00.026
♪ <i>How do I know?</i> ♪
All right, everyone.

22:00.094 --> 22:01.955
On the count of three,

22:02.075 --> 22:04.630
we're all gonna drop our robes.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.092
One...

22:08.431 --> 22:12.406
two... three!

22:21.187 --> 22:23.284
I was just everyone's victim.

22:23.351 --> 22:25.953
Poor Mary Eunice.

22:28.863 --> 22:32.000
The only place I thought
I'd be safe was with God.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.167
God.

22:33.234 --> 22:34.835
You know there's no God, right?

22:34.903 --> 22:37.337
You already figured out that it's just

22:37.405 --> 22:38.705
a bunch of crap someone made up

22:38.773 --> 22:40.207
to keep you from being who you are,

22:40.274 --> 22:43.944
from doing what you really want to do.

22:44.012 --> 22:46.747
What a chump.

22:46.814 --> 22:48.348
Look where it got me.

22:48.416 --> 22:50.884
Right here, taking shit
from a mean old bitch

22:50.951 --> 22:55.021
who drinks and wears trashy red lingerie

22:55.089 --> 22:57.758
under her habit.

22:59.894 --> 23:03.163
But not for long.

23:03.231 --> 23:04.899
They're gonna lock me up in my room.

23:04.966 --> 23:08.736
I'll never be able to do
anything I want ever again.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.906
Don't be a whiner.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.741
You're smarter than they are.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.809
Don't you ever forget it.

23:14.877 --> 23:17.378
Maybe you just need to learn
how to defend yourself.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.883
<i>Fine. We'll be expecting you.</i>

23:27.056 --> 23:28.523
Monsignor.

23:29.959 --> 23:30.926
Crisis averted.

23:32.529 --> 23:33.762
I mean, she-she went off

23:33.830 --> 23:36.532
and-and left her daughter here,

23:36.600 --> 23:39.402
as if we're some kind of
personal child care facility.

23:42.473 --> 23:44.875
For heaven's sakes,

23:44.942 --> 23:48.111
what is that expression
on your face, Timothy?

23:48.179 --> 23:50.347
It seems Briarcliff's become
quite a burden for you.

23:50.415 --> 23:52.448
No, no.

23:52.516 --> 23:55.485
We just had a few, uh, difficult days,

23:55.552 --> 23:57.587
but the order has been restored...

23:57.655 --> 24:00.290
Sister, I've contacted a colleague,

24:00.357 --> 24:03.759
Father Bernard, in Pittsburgh.

24:03.827 --> 24:05.929
He's just opened a home
for wayward girls.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.132
I've recommended you highly

24:09.200 --> 24:10.901
to run it.

24:10.968 --> 24:12.736
Are you firing me?

24:12.804 --> 24:14.038
You've lost your way.

24:14.105 --> 24:15.406
You need a new beginning.

24:16.742 --> 24:18.577
You're booked on a plane

24:18.644 --> 24:22.280
out of Logan Airport,
Friday morning, 8:30 a.m.

24:24.217 --> 24:28.721
This is... this is all
about Dr. Arden, isn't it?

24:28.789 --> 24:30.589
Dr. Arden is not
the issue here!

24:30.657 --> 24:33.792
Dr. Arden is
entirely the issue here!

24:35.888 --> 24:37.582
He's turned you against me.

24:37.702 --> 24:39.133
But I was right about him.

24:39.253 --> 24:40.759
Pack up your things, Sister.

25:02.252 --> 25:05.487
Little Jenny Reynolds' mother
came by and picked her up.

25:05.555 --> 25:08.390
That's fine.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.928
Is there anything else, Sister?

25:12.996 --> 25:14.062
No, Sister.

25:14.182 --> 25:15.898
Yes, Sister.
What are you doing?

25:15.965 --> 25:17.800
I'm packing.

25:17.867 --> 25:20.336
I'm leaving Briarcliff.

25:20.403 --> 25:23.105
The monsignor, in his wisdom,

25:23.172 --> 25:28.277
has decided that my talents
would serve better elsewhere.

25:29.679 --> 25:31.346
Pittsburgh, as it turns out.

25:31.414 --> 25:33.182
Pittsburgh?

25:33.249 --> 25:35.484
No, Sister Jude,
you can't leave Briarcliff.

25:35.552 --> 25:37.353
I have no choice.

25:37.421 --> 25:39.789
But what will become of us?

25:48.098 --> 25:49.932
No, I won't leave you

25:50.000 --> 25:52.301
to the tender mercies
of Dr. Arden.

25:52.369 --> 25:55.301
There's something I can do
before I'm exiled.

25:55.368 --> 25:56.501
Go to the kitchen.

25:58.771 --> 26:02.174
The special bottle of cognac
I keep for the monsignor--

26:02.242 --> 26:05.010
bring it to me.

26:05.078 --> 26:06.979
And two very clean glasses.

26:18.257 --> 26:19.791
Thredson residence.

26:19.859 --> 26:21.259
Thank God you picked up,
Dr. Thredson.

26:21.327 --> 26:22.594
You're my one phone call.

26:22.662 --> 26:24.363
Listen, you got to help me.

26:24.431 --> 26:26.832
The cops put me in jail,
and they say they have proof

26:26.900 --> 26:28.267
I killed Alma and those other ladies.

26:28.334 --> 26:29.568
They say

26:29.636 --> 26:30.769
they have a tape of my confession.

26:36.043 --> 26:38.044
<i>I thought we had a deal.</i>

26:38.112 --> 26:39.979
I thought you said, if I say
all that stuff out loud,

26:40.047 --> 26:41.247
you'll tell the courts
I could stay at Briarcliff.

26:41.315 --> 26:42.849
No, no, Kit.

26:42.916 --> 26:46.619
I told you to say
what you believe is true.

26:46.687 --> 26:48.221
<i>I was confused.</i>

26:48.288 --> 26:49.355
Now I know the truth.

26:49.423 --> 26:51.424
Alma's not dead. Grace saw her.

26:51.491 --> 26:53.292
She told me.
Kit...

26:53.360 --> 26:55.961
you need to take responsibility
for what you did.

26:59.017 --> 27:01.094
You said you'd lie for me
so I could avoid the chair,

27:01.214 --> 27:02.568
but all you did was lie to me.

27:02.636 --> 27:03.803
How'd the cops get the tape, huh?

27:03.871 --> 27:04.904
Did you give it to them?

27:04.972 --> 27:06.005
Oh, come on.

27:07.174 --> 27:08.141
<i>I bet this was</i>

27:08.208 --> 27:09.275
your plan all along, wasn't it?

27:09.343 --> 27:10.910
You didn't want to help me.

27:10.978 --> 27:12.212
You're full of shit, and you're a liar.

27:12.279 --> 27:14.281
Stop. You stop calling me that.

27:14.348 --> 27:16.751
You're a phony, lying bastard!

27:16.818 --> 27:19.086
Stop...! Stop calling me that!

27:31.166 --> 27:32.367
He's unbelievable.

27:33.836 --> 27:36.471
He has the nerve to call me a liar,

27:36.539 --> 27:39.541
when he's the one spouting fantasies

27:39.609 --> 27:40.977
about little green men!

27:41.044 --> 27:42.612
Kit?

27:42.680 --> 27:44.380
You talk to him?

27:58.897 --> 28:00.965
Perspiration from a rise
in body temperature.

28:03.836 --> 28:05.036
Accelerated heart rate.

28:06.872 --> 28:07.872
What are you up to?

28:07.940 --> 28:08.907
Nothing.

28:16.114 --> 28:17.414
I knew it.

28:19.317 --> 28:21.251
You were gonna abandon me.

28:23.255 --> 28:24.388
Just like my mother.

28:29.495 --> 28:31.797
You're all the same.

28:31.865 --> 28:33.866
I'm not...
Shut your dirty mouth.

28:33.934 --> 28:34.867
I'm not like them.

28:34.935 --> 28:36.342
I'm not.

28:36.565 --> 28:38.571
I'm not like them.
I'm not like them.

28:38.638 --> 28:40.472
It's such a disappointment...

28:40.540 --> 28:42.208
I'm not.

28:42.275 --> 28:45.744
...when people don't
live up to expectations.

28:50.383 --> 28:54.287
Sometimes all you can do is...
end it.

29:11.539 --> 29:14.507
This is your fault.

29:14.575 --> 29:16.709
You have no one to blame but yourself.

29:16.777 --> 29:17.811
Please.

Hello.

30:10.255 --> 30:11.956
It's Sam Goodman.

30:12.023 --> 30:15.092
This is Sister Jude.

30:24.135 --> 30:26.035
Toast, Arthur.

30:27.237 --> 30:29.738
A toast to what?

30:31.240 --> 30:33.274
You won.

30:33.342 --> 30:37.077
And I've always prided myself
on my good sportsmanship.

30:45.019 --> 30:48.021
To your impressive
single-mindedness.

30:48.088 --> 30:50.356
I thought this was
supposed to be a toast.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.593
Ah, yes.

30:53.660 --> 30:55.061
We're abstaining these days, aren't we?

30:57.498 --> 30:59.799
I wouldn't dream of drinking alone.

31:06.106 --> 31:08.107
You know...

31:08.175 --> 31:10.609
there are times in life
that warrant an exception.

31:12.712 --> 31:13.612
To you.

31:15.181 --> 31:16.982
And to God's will.

31:57.656 --> 31:59.857
Yes?

31:59.925 --> 32:03.061
I'm sorry, did Sister Jude send you?

32:03.128 --> 32:05.096
She doesn't know I'm here.

32:19.236 --> 32:21.071
Mr. Goodman?

32:27.512 --> 32:29.046
Mr. Goodman?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.481
I came as fast I could.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.016
I have the glass with the fingerprints.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.856
Mr. Goodman?

32:47.433 --> 32:50.602
Hello. Hello?

32:54.073 --> 32:54.973
Huh.

33:01.248 --> 33:03.249
Oh, God.

33:03.317 --> 33:05.185
Oh, no!

33:06.621 --> 33:09.890
Oh... no...

33:09.957 --> 33:11.191
Oh, God.

33:11.258 --> 33:12.525
Oh, my God.

33:12.593 --> 33:14.260
I'll call an ambulance.

33:14.328 --> 33:15.361
Listen, listen...

33:15.429 --> 33:16.696
What?
Listen...

33:16.764 --> 33:17.964
Arden did this.

33:18.032 --> 33:19.299
No, no.

33:19.366 --> 33:21.534
Nun.
Ah... What?

33:21.602 --> 33:23.303
What? What?

33:23.371 --> 33:26.442
What did...?
A nun...

33:26.510 --> 33:28.678
A nun.
A nun...

33:28.746 --> 33:30.046
A nun?

33:30.114 --> 33:31.647
What?
One of...

33:31.715 --> 33:33.049
yours.

33:33.117 --> 33:34.550
One of... yours.

33:34.618 --> 33:38.055
Hans Grouper.

33:38.122 --> 33:39.223
You were handsome.

33:42.527 --> 33:44.695
Do you mean to tell me Sister Jude

33:44.763 --> 33:49.400
has this Israeli Sherlock Holmes
holed up in some motel?

33:49.468 --> 33:52.436
She was determined to expose you.

33:52.504 --> 33:54.705
But you don't need to worry anymore.

33:54.773 --> 33:56.874
I've taken care of everything...

33:56.942 --> 33:58.409
Hans.

33:58.477 --> 34:00.378
Don't...

34:00.445 --> 34:02.380
call me that.

34:02.447 --> 34:03.948
Ever.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.954
Are you quite sure this is all of it?

34:10.022 --> 34:11.188
No.

34:11.255 --> 34:13.357
It's not all of it.

34:13.425 --> 34:15.827
I've hidden some evidence away

34:15.895 --> 34:17.429
in case you try
and double-cross me.

34:21.132 --> 34:23.501
You must understand, these...

34:23.569 --> 34:27.005
so-called Nazi hunters
are nothing but...

34:27.072 --> 34:30.809
self-loathing,
self-seeking,

34:30.876 --> 34:33.311
money-grubbing Jews!

34:33.379 --> 34:36.746
The Catholic Church
certainly understood that.

34:36.815 --> 34:39.315
At least the Pope had
the good sense to...

34:39.384 --> 34:41.618
Arthur...
I am not a monster!

34:41.686 --> 34:43.620
I'm a visionary.

34:46.056 --> 34:51.396
Do you have any idea how
lonely a path this is?

34:51.463 --> 34:53.931
What it's like to have to
carry on your work in secret,

34:53.998 --> 34:57.135
hiding from those pious vigilantes?
Arthur!

35:00.006 --> 35:01.372
You're preaching to the converted.

35:02.808 --> 35:05.043
Why?

35:06.879 --> 35:09.148
Why are you protecting me?

35:15.021 --> 35:17.189
You're not in love with me.

35:18.525 --> 35:21.160
I'm no fool.

35:21.228 --> 35:23.163
I know I'm too old.

35:23.231 --> 35:25.333
Too ugly.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.635
Is there something...

35:28.703 --> 35:30.070
you want from me?

35:31.573 --> 35:35.175
This is the beginning
of a whole new era.

35:35.243 --> 35:38.179
All you need to do

35:38.246 --> 35:40.080
is trust me

35:40.148 --> 35:43.483
with your entire soul,

35:43.551 --> 35:46.519
and I promise you

35:46.587 --> 35:48.522
that everything will work out.

35:56.598 --> 35:58.833
Who killed her?

35:58.901 --> 36:00.468
Did you see him?

36:00.536 --> 36:02.637
He was tall.

36:02.705 --> 36:04.005
He had a beard

36:04.073 --> 36:05.840
and a brown jacket.

36:05.908 --> 36:08.744
First, he slashed my brother
and sister's throats,

36:08.812 --> 36:11.647
then he stabbed my mother in the back.

36:11.714 --> 36:13.815
I tried to stop him,

36:13.883 --> 36:15.817
but he said he would kill me, too,

36:15.885 --> 36:18.119
if I moved a muscle.

36:26.028 --> 36:28.162
You're trying not to scream.

36:29.965 --> 36:32.500
But you will.

36:35.938 --> 36:39.274
They always do
when I make the first incision.

36:40.676 --> 36:42.577
But then shock will take over...

36:44.780 --> 36:47.415
...and you won't
feel anything.

36:50.619 --> 36:53.487
It doesn't have to be this way.

36:55.324 --> 36:57.524
I wish that were true, Lana.

36:59.827 --> 37:03.195
I had such high hopes for you.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.464
From the moment

37:05.531 --> 37:08.267
I saw you, so ambitious,

37:08.335 --> 37:10.603
so... alive.

37:10.671 --> 37:12.372
I was never alive in there.

37:13.741 --> 37:16.609
No, not there.

37:16.677 --> 37:19.712
Before Briarcliff.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.180
<i>Oh, come on, Phil.</i>

37:21.248 --> 37:23.449
Aren't you sick and tired
of writing the same piece

37:23.517 --> 37:25.017
with different names?

37:25.085 --> 37:27.219
Start with some blood and guts,
a pinch of sympathy

37:27.287 --> 37:28.754
for the poor victims,

37:28.822 --> 37:30.856
and then top it off with moral outrage.

37:30.924 --> 37:32.391
Isn't that the recipe?
You're the one who knows about recipes.

37:32.459 --> 37:34.592
What are you doing here?

37:34.659 --> 37:36.160
And when did you get
assigned to the crime beat?

37:36.227 --> 37:38.595
You think Upton Sinclair
waits to be assigned a story?

37:38.663 --> 37:40.131
I'm making this my story.

37:40.198 --> 37:42.500
Oh, a woman's touch, huh?
Yes, exactly.

37:42.567 --> 37:44.502
That's what's been missing
from this story.

37:44.569 --> 37:47.037
You think this mook's just some monster,

37:47.105 --> 37:49.139
but no monster starts off that way.

37:49.207 --> 37:52.142
He was somebody's precious baby,
crying for his mommy.

37:52.210 --> 37:53.944
Here comes your precious baby now.

37:55.747 --> 37:57.147
Hey, Walker, why'd you do it?

37:57.215 --> 37:58.449
Huh?

37:58.517 --> 38:00.518
Where's the body?

38:00.586 --> 38:02.554
Come on, Walker.

38:02.621 --> 38:04.756
What, you got nothing to say?

38:06.625 --> 38:08.459
You got a statement, Walker?

38:08.527 --> 38:10.494
I thought that you

38:10.562 --> 38:12.229
were the first person

38:12.297 --> 38:14.097
who could understand.
I do.

38:14.165 --> 38:16.332
I do understand.
No.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.500
You don't.

38:22.172 --> 38:23.573
That's all right, Oliver.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.474
I don't want you to feel guilty.

38:25.542 --> 38:28.444
A mother's love is unconditional.

38:28.512 --> 38:30.747
You never had that, did you?

38:30.815 --> 38:32.282
Everyone deserves that.

38:33.718 --> 38:35.519
Even you.

38:40.493 --> 38:42.127
Baby.

38:49.435 --> 38:51.270
It's me.

38:51.337 --> 38:53.172
My baby.

39:00.614 --> 39:02.148
Baby needs colostrum.

39:16.497 --> 39:18.164
Car out front is registered

39:18.232 --> 39:20.766
to a Leo Morrison out
of Encino, California.

39:20.834 --> 39:22.334
He one of our dead
trick-or-treaters?

39:22.402 --> 39:24.471
Doubtful. Mr. Morrison's
in his early 30s.

39:24.538 --> 39:25.904
We're putting these three as teenagers.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.930
Still trying to I.D. them.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.531
Detectives!

39:29.599 --> 39:31.466
We got another one!

39:36.438 --> 39:38.505
Mr. Morrison,
I presume.

39:40.008 --> 39:42.643
All right, full search of the grounds.

39:42.711 --> 39:44.578
Let's do it before we lose daylight.

39:44.646 --> 39:46.247
We're looking for at least a body part.

39:46.315 --> 39:49.416
Chances are whoever
called this in is our perp.

40:03.030 --> 40:04.598
This is Detective John Grayson.

40:04.666 --> 40:05.673
Who is this?

40:05.793 --> 40:07.434
You know who I am.

40:07.502 --> 40:08.836
No, I don't.

40:08.904 --> 40:10.137
Did you kill these people?

40:10.205 --> 40:11.496
Only the imposters.

40:11.616 --> 40:13.607
I just wanted you to know that.

40:15.077 --> 40:16.744
Just spoke to Leo Morrison's sister.

40:16.812 --> 40:18.847
He's out here on his honeymoon.

40:18.914 --> 40:20.115
Shit.

40:20.182 --> 40:21.783
Where's his bride?

40:21.851 --> 40:31.916
