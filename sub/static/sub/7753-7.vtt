00:07.610 --> 00:10.780
It's been five days since I debuted
as a professional hero.

00:11.190 --> 00:13.950
There haven't been
any serious incidents so far.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.490
However, for some reason Genos
is staying at my house.

00:19.830 --> 00:21.910
What are you writing over there?

00:22.000 --> 00:25.040
I'm recording the details of
your lessons and training regimen.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.210
Crap. He's raising the bar again…

00:28.540 --> 00:31.460
I can't think of a single thing
I can teach the guy.

00:31.710 --> 00:34.260
I feel bad, like I'm scamming him
or something.

00:34.720 --> 00:39.140
Come on, think. Or just make up
some techniques or a spiritual theory.

00:39.260 --> 00:41.100
Bah, strength training is all I've got!

00:41.140 --> 00:43.770
I know Genos won't be satisfied
with that, plus the dude's a cyborg!

00:43.770 --> 00:44.560
By the way,

00:44.980 --> 00:47.770
at the seminar
they said if you're a Class C hero

00:47.980 --> 00:49.940
and you have no hero activity
for a week,

00:50.190 --> 00:52.740
your name will be removed
from the Hero Registry.

00:52.780 --> 00:54.450
Will you be all right, Master?

00:55.030 --> 00:56.450
They said that?!

00:56.780 --> 00:57.280
Yes.

00:57.530 --> 01:00.580
But I was watching TV and
there wasn't anything going on.

01:00.620 --> 01:03.660
The news only reports
major incidents,

01:03.700 --> 01:07.000
like natural disasters, terrorism
and dangerous monsters.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.000
You always fight
the most powerful enemies,

01:10.040 --> 01:11.420
so you probably do not know it,

01:11.880 --> 01:14.420
but Class C heroes primarily
take care of purse snatchers,

01:14.670 --> 01:16.840
robberies and random attacks.

01:17.220 --> 01:18.800
With Class C so full of heroes,

01:18.840 --> 01:21.510
to survive they must actively
look for cases to resolve.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.850
I hear many of them get discouraged
and change careers.

01:24.390 --> 01:26.060
Like a salesman doing cold calls,

01:26.100 --> 01:29.110
nothing will come your way
without legwork.

01:29.150 --> 01:31.650
This is no time to be reading manga!

01:31.980 --> 01:32.820
So we're going?

01:32.820 --> 01:33.860
You stay here!

01:33.900 --> 01:35.490
If I'm with a Class S hero,

01:35.530 --> 01:38.160
a Class C like me
won't get any credit!

01:38.200 --> 01:39.740
But as your disciple—

01:41.200 --> 01:45.120
Genos, from the beginning
my intense desire to be a hero

01:45.160 --> 01:47.540
was what drove me
to strength training.

01:47.580 --> 01:48.830
That's how I made it this far.

01:49.790 --> 01:55.380
For you, perhaps things will change
if you aim higher as a hero.

01:56.300 --> 02:00.090
Frankly speaking, you're a cyborg,
so training your body won't do.

02:00.390 --> 02:03.100
Instead, a change in mindset
may lead you to greater strength.

02:05.310 --> 02:08.310
Damn, I'm just making
all this crap up…

02:09.900 --> 02:11.860
So…in other words,

02:11.860 --> 02:15.150
HOW I DEVELOPED
INDOMITABLE WILL
BY S CLASS HERO KING
it's not about having
raw power or technique;

02:15.150 --> 02:17.440
HOW I DEVELOPED
INDOMITABLE WILL
BY S CLASS HERO KING
it's about training your mind.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.450
HOW I DEVELOPED
INDOMITABLE WILL
BY S CLASS HERO KING
To do that,

02:18.450 --> 02:20.950
you must first fight your way through
the professional hero industry.

02:21.070 --> 02:24.200
Aim to break into the top ten
of the Class S heroes.

02:24.910 --> 02:27.040
That will be your goal for now.

02:29.330 --> 02:31.920
I understand. I will try!

02:32.130 --> 02:34.800
He bought it… Sweet.

02:41.010 --> 02:43.140
After that, I sped around town.

02:43.140 --> 02:45.640
While frantically looking
for bad guys…

02:45.850 --> 02:46.810
I ran.

02:47.220 --> 02:48.230
And ran.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.350
And ran.

02:50.390 --> 02:51.230
But!

02:51.940 --> 02:53.940
The city was quiet!

02:55.150 --> 02:56.690
I give up…

02:58.400 --> 03:00.150
Just one more day left.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.620
Guess I'll head home.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.170
I'll leave tomorrow's problems
to tomorrow's me.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:44.050 --> 04:46.640
THE FOLLOWING DAY

04:49.010 --> 04:50.680
It's quiet today too!

04:51.270 --> 04:53.810
There's nothing to do!

04:54.020 --> 04:55.980
I'm gonna lose my registration!

05:00.770 --> 05:02.990
Hey! You're that guy…

05:03.690 --> 05:04.900
What was it?

05:06.110 --> 05:07.320
"Seed-on-the-Ground…"?

05:07.820 --> 05:09.700
No wait, "Lost-and-found…"?

05:10.660 --> 05:11.990
Jack-o'-lantern Panic!

05:11.990 --> 05:13.540
It's Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.790
I've finally found you, Saitama.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.040
Today is the day we—

05:19.080 --> 05:21.300
Hey sorry, I'm busy. See you 'round..

05:22.590 --> 05:23.170
Huh?

05:24.340 --> 05:26.010
You think…

05:26.550 --> 05:28.430
…you can run from me?!

05:32.010 --> 05:34.140
What the—?
I didn't see what happened.

05:35.180 --> 05:38.310
His face should have been
sliced open, but the blade…

05:39.060 --> 05:41.980
I told you…I'm busy.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.900
Plus I'm pissed,
so anyone in my way…

05:48.240 --> 05:49.280
…gets punched.

05:51.580 --> 05:52.910
That's him!

05:52.950 --> 05:54.290
He's very, very dangerous.

05:54.330 --> 05:55.870
Please stop him.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.500
So you're the offender, eh?!

06:00.130 --> 06:02.920
Well, the hero Tank-Top Tiger
is here now!

06:04.130 --> 06:05.210
Hero?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.890
Sonic, they think you're
some sort of criminal.

06:10.010 --> 06:12.510
Maybe getting tossed in a cell
will cool off your hot—

06:13.720 --> 06:15.640
She means you, cue ball.

06:16.390 --> 06:17.140
Huh?

06:17.430 --> 06:19.230
He's been running around town

06:19.270 --> 06:22.690
with this scary look on his face
since yesterday!

06:22.730 --> 06:24.400
But I'm a hero too!

06:24.440 --> 06:27.440
I've never heard of a hero like you.

06:27.490 --> 06:29.280
So what? I just started!

06:29.410 --> 06:32.830
In any case, you're causing
problems for everyone.

06:33.030 --> 06:36.580
If you're really a hero, then don't
go around frightening people.

06:36.870 --> 06:39.420
You're hurting
all the other heroes' reputation.

06:39.460 --> 06:41.960
Hey isn't that Tank-Top Tiger?

06:42.040 --> 06:44.000
Oh yeah, it is Tank-Top Tiger.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.130
No way!

06:45.170 --> 06:46.550
Awesome, he's the real deal!

06:50.550 --> 06:54.720
Even Class C heroes get recognized
if they're in the top 10.

06:55.970 --> 06:58.140
So how â€˜bout it, new guy?

06:58.140 --> 07:01.980
Wanna go a little wild here
and make me look good?

07:01.980 --> 07:03.650
Exploding Shuriken.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.570
EXPLODING SHURIKEN

07:11.160 --> 07:12.360
Tank-Top Tiger?!

07:12.410 --> 07:13.740
Is this really happening?

07:14.200 --> 07:16.160
What are you doing, Sonic?

07:16.950 --> 07:20.210
He was interfering,
so I put him to sleep.

07:20.410 --> 07:22.170
Hey, call a hero!

07:22.210 --> 07:22.960
A hero!

07:23.000 --> 07:24.080
Run!

07:25.170 --> 07:26.210
Saitama…

07:27.000 --> 07:30.880
So you too have become one of
these worthless "heroes?"

07:32.340 --> 07:34.510
Then all I have to do
is create a situation

07:34.550 --> 07:38.770
where you have no choice
but to fight me, Saitama the Hero!

07:40.680 --> 07:42.100
Hail of Carnage!

07:47.820 --> 07:48.280
Huh?

07:52.400 --> 07:53.660
Hey! Cut it out!

07:54.160 --> 07:56.700
Saitama, come stop me!

07:56.910 --> 07:58.290
You're a hero!

07:58.330 --> 07:59.750
I'll kill them all!

08:06.420 --> 08:07.670
Damn it.

08:08.170 --> 08:10.460
Can't everyone
just let me do my job?

08:11.010 --> 08:13.300
I don't have time for this!

08:14.470 --> 08:16.760
I gotta find a bad guy to take down.

08:21.020 --> 08:22.020
A bad guy?

08:23.480 --> 08:25.100
If you're not coming, I'll go to you!

08:26.100 --> 08:26.860
I'm right here.

08:36.570 --> 08:39.080
I wonder if this will count as work?

08:41.080 --> 08:44.370
The man apprehended in City Z
by the Class C hero

08:44.670 --> 08:47.460
is suspected of being involved in
several heinous crimes,

08:47.500 --> 08:48.920
including assassination.

08:50.710 --> 08:51.800
City Z…

08:54.680 --> 08:57.050
What's the status of
the investigation I requested?

08:57.300 --> 08:59.180
The one for the ghost town?

08:59.220 --> 08:59.720
Yes.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.010
Let's see…

09:02.020 --> 09:04.430
We've submitted an official request.

09:06.310 --> 09:09.310
Well now,
doesn't that sound interesting.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.110
Want me to go?

09:11.610 --> 09:12.690
Tornado?

09:12.900 --> 09:13.990
Where'd you come from?

09:14.030 --> 09:16.070
Why? Aren't I allowed in here?

09:16.110 --> 09:17.070
Of course.

09:17.110 --> 09:20.530
But for City Z,
the investigation is just a formality.

09:20.580 --> 09:21.450
What?

09:22.370 --> 09:24.710
You think I'm not good enough?

09:28.170 --> 09:29.130
Not at all.

09:29.540 --> 09:33.340
The Association decided that
this was not a Class S matter.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.380
Yes, exactly right.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.680
You'd better tell me if you find
anything that looks like it can fight.

09:47.140 --> 09:49.350
It'd be so much faster
if I just went myself.

09:50.520 --> 09:51.860
You're such an idiot.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.350
CITY A –
HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

10:21.350 --> 10:23.140
CITY A –
HERO ASSOCIATION HQ
Reports have come in from
each location being investigated.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.140
Reports have come in from
each location being investigated.

10:27.180 --> 10:29.980
First is Watchdog Man,
Class S hero, investigating City Q.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.060
"Nothing unusual."

10:31.190 --> 10:32.440
Nothing unusual?

10:32.520 --> 10:34.520
– That's right.
– That's hard to believe.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.280
We all know City Q is a hot zone

10:37.320 --> 10:40.990
with more casualties and monsters
than any other area.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.120
Knowing him,
I'm sure he's implying that,

10:44.160 --> 10:47.750
"Whatever occurs,
I'll be able to take care of it."

10:48.410 --> 10:51.210
Though he has focused
his efforts on City Q,

10:51.540 --> 10:54.670
his track record at
monster elimination is top-notch.

10:55.130 --> 10:57.170
Class S heroes don't
pay much attention to details.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.130
They're not cut out
for writing reports.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.930
Next, City W.

11:02.010 --> 11:04.720
Class A hero Heavy Kong reports:
"Nothing unusual."

11:05.680 --> 11:09.020
For City H, reports from Mushroom,
Class B, and Horsebone, Class C:

11:09.060 --> 11:10.060
"Nothing unusual."

11:10.270 --> 11:12.770
For City D, Lightning Genji,
Class A:

11:13.060 --> 11:15.570
"Slow restoration after
the devastation caused by"

11:15.860 --> 11:18.150
"the gigantic creature aside,
nothing unusual."

11:18.690 --> 11:21.910
Cities B and D
both sustained extensive damage.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.070
The Association took
a lot of heat for that.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.990
In order to prevent
more such disasters,

11:27.240 --> 11:31.330
we must detect any covert activity
that could threaten the community.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.630
Well, this investigation was
requested for that express purpose.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.840
But early detection of monsters
is proving difficult.

11:39.510 --> 11:42.430
City F, Class A hero,
"Snakebite" Snek.

11:43.260 --> 11:46.220
"Hammerhead, former leader
of the Paradiser terrorist group,"

11:46.390 --> 11:49.020
"has been spotted
in a suit and tie."

11:49.020 --> 11:50.810
"Further investigation
is being conducted."

11:51.060 --> 11:52.060
No other reports.

11:52.310 --> 11:54.020
What of City Z?

11:54.230 --> 11:57.360
I hear rumblings of
a potential disaster brewing

11:57.400 --> 11:59.150
in the abandoned area there.

11:59.190 --> 12:00.690
No reports available.

12:01.820 --> 12:05.070
However, two highly capable
Class A heroes

12:05.120 --> 12:08.160
have been sent to the area
to investigate.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.580
Here we are in City Z.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.420
CLASS A, RANK 33 –
SPRING MUSTACHIO
Shall we begin our little inquiry?

12:17.460 --> 12:20.210
CLASS A, RANK 29 –
GOLDEN BALL
Yeah, let's get on with it.

12:25.890 --> 12:29.140
City Z is quite expansive,
but further ahead lies

12:29.180 --> 12:32.140
the uninhabited area
we were told about.

12:32.850 --> 12:33.890
Compared with other areas,

12:33.980 --> 12:38.190
BEWARE OF MONSTERS!!
City Z has an abnormally high rate
of monster-related incidents.

12:39.070 --> 12:42.320
The frequency has been gradually
increasing over the past 10 years,

12:42.650 --> 12:44.570
while the last few have seen
more and more

12:44.610 --> 12:46.030
highly advanced monsters appearing.

12:46.450 --> 12:49.660
The residents have entirely fled
for the city center.

12:49.910 --> 12:50.990
I know all that.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.120
The place is a real ghost town,

12:53.160 --> 12:56.080
just with the water and electricity
still intact, yeah?

12:56.170 --> 12:58.380
On the lookout for a cheap house?

12:58.540 --> 12:59.750
Come off it.

13:00.130 --> 13:03.010
People say something
real nasty's living 'round here.

13:03.220 --> 13:04.720
Even you must've heard.

13:05.220 --> 13:06.180
But of course.

13:06.510 --> 13:10.470
I assume that's why we have been
assigned this investigation.

13:11.220 --> 13:15.480
Once we hit the abandoned area,
we better be ready to fight.

13:15.890 --> 13:19.110
Indeed,
we mustn't let our guard down.

13:20.980 --> 13:24.320
But, why here?
Why the increase in monsters here?

13:24.900 --> 13:26.400
That's the mystery.

13:26.780 --> 13:30.330
Many theories have been advanced,
but my own is this:

13:30.660 --> 13:34.040
A colony of monsters here is
naturally producing more of them.

13:34.200 --> 13:37.080
Or perhaps a queen exists,
birthing more of her kind.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.550
Of course I have no proof yet,

13:44.090 --> 13:46.550
but there is something
to this ghost town…

13:47.050 --> 13:49.640
Or rather, something in it.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.640
Of that you can be sure.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.520
The proximity alarm?

13:56.060 --> 13:57.810
If we can hunt down
this mysterious being,

13:57.980 --> 14:00.360
we'll go straight to
the top of the rankings.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.730
That's true.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.530
We can't let Mr. Amai Mask
remain first for—

14:05.030 --> 14:06.030
– Something's there?!
– Something's there?!

14:06.070 --> 14:07.450
Was that a monster?

14:07.610 --> 14:08.990
No way to be sure…

14:09.570 --> 14:13.120
But it's hard to imagine a human
still living in these conditions.

14:13.950 --> 14:14.950
Let's pursue it!

14:18.620 --> 14:20.460
Seems they are not after us.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.260
Can this be the place
I heard about?

14:26.090 --> 14:28.380
Sure don't seem like it…

14:28.800 --> 14:33.140
Aw man, I came all this way.
Isn't anyone around?

14:36.060 --> 14:38.890
A monster.
It popped up out of nowhere.

14:39.190 --> 14:41.560
Golden Ball, are you ready?

14:41.730 --> 14:42.770
Hell yes.

14:42.940 --> 14:44.610
Victory to the swift!

14:44.900 --> 14:46.070
Hey, people!

14:46.400 --> 14:49.030
I can blast through
a 20mm steel plate

14:49.030 --> 14:51.530
with one of my shape-memory
golden bullets!

14:51.700 --> 14:53.030
Eat this!

15:01.580 --> 15:03.130
He flicked it away like nothing.

15:16.140 --> 15:17.140
Golden Ball!

15:47.840 --> 15:49.210
Wow!

15:59.390 --> 16:00.890
Tomboy…

16:02.350 --> 16:03.350
…thrust!

16:07.150 --> 16:09.570
It slipped past my Tomboy?

16:15.990 --> 16:17.160
Not bad.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.240
Those tentacles…

16:19.450 --> 16:21.830
From the way they react,
they're tough as steel.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.040
A monster that can use
its infinite number of tentacles

16:25.080 --> 16:26.380
like steel whips…

16:27.670 --> 16:28.710
Such power!

16:33.050 --> 16:35.390
I must call in reinforcements
from the Association.

16:36.640 --> 16:41.350
May I ask if you were born
in this neighborhood?

16:42.850 --> 16:44.890
Nah, I'm from out of town.

16:45.150 --> 16:49.190
I heard a bunch of crazy strong monsters
were all getting together here.

16:49.940 --> 16:53.490
Looks like it was
just a rumor though.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.200
But now,

16:57.450 --> 17:02.580
I feel like it'd be kinda fun to
stick around and make the rumor true.

17:02.950 --> 17:04.750
"The Ghost Town Monster…"

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
It's got a nice ring to it!

17:08.670 --> 17:12.339
We have a backup request from
the heroes dispatched to City Z.

17:12.670 --> 17:15.760
Class A rank 29, Golden Ball,
has been knocked out.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.550
Class A rank 33,
Spring Mustachio, is in trouble.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.060
They're in the abandoned city.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.970
Call in all nearby heroes
for immediate assistance!

17:23.480 --> 17:24.599
Class A and above!

17:25.690 --> 17:27.690
See the monster alert for City Z?

17:27.770 --> 17:30.070
The threat level seems to be
Tiger or higher.

17:30.570 --> 17:32.190
Is it the ghost town monster?

17:32.570 --> 17:34.110
They're not sure yet.

17:34.780 --> 17:35.780
I'll go…

17:37.030 --> 17:39.200
I want to catch the tiger
by its tail.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.210
Now I see…

17:53.800 --> 17:56.630
If it means running into monsters
like this all the time

17:57.010 --> 17:59.890
I wouldn't want to
live here either.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.940
Man, boring. This is boring me!

18:07.100 --> 18:10.770
I finally kick a hero's butt
and I don't get even a single scream.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.900
Now that I think about it,
even if I start living here,

18:15.070 --> 18:17.360
I'll never be famous
if there's no people.

18:18.320 --> 18:22.450
Guess I'll keep going.
Gotta find where they live.

18:24.330 --> 18:25.540
There's somebody.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.830
Another hero?

18:28.830 --> 18:29.920
Or a regular guy?

18:30.830 --> 18:33.590
I thought all the humans
cleared out.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.380
If all those monsters
were really around,

18:35.420 --> 18:37.380
there's no way he could live here…

18:39.680 --> 18:42.930
I guess that means
it was just a rumor.

18:43.560 --> 18:44.560
Shoot…

18:45.930 --> 18:47.770
I forgot to buy konbu soup stock.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.730
Master, I saw a lot of konbu
right outside the door.

18:55.980 --> 18:57.940
Oh yeah, I just…

18:59.950 --> 19:03.450
just happened…
to get it for cheap.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.910
Yes, people say that konbu
is good for hair growth,

19:10.120 --> 19:11.790
but since there is
no real scientific proof,

19:11.960 --> 19:14.340
its real effects
are yet to be confirmed.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.130
I did some research,
so I am sure, Master.

19:18.340 --> 19:19.920
For example,
according to this site—

19:19.970 --> 19:21.630
No one said anything about hair!

19:22.390 --> 19:23.970
City Z Investigative Report.

19:24.470 --> 19:27.770
"Nothing noteworthy about
the downtown or residential areas."

19:28.680 --> 19:29.770
â€œDuring our investigation,â€

19:29.810 --> 19:33.150
"we encountered a ferocious monster
in the abandoned area,"

19:33.440 --> 19:34.860
"but were unable to
exterminate it."

19:35.270 --> 19:36.770
"We escaped death,"

19:36.820 --> 19:38.940
"but the monster
we encountered disappeared"

19:38.940 --> 19:41.570
"and it is possible that
it still roams the area."

19:41.780 --> 19:45.160
"Also, according to this monster,
there's a rumor that…"

19:45.200 --> 19:48.950
"…powerful monsters
already exist in this area."

19:49.750 --> 19:52.960
Sounds like it was pretty brutal.

19:53.290 --> 19:54.630
A monster?

19:54.670 --> 19:55.880
Yes.

19:57.550 --> 19:59.960
I think I'll pass this time.

20:00.550 --> 20:03.760
See? I told you I should have gone!

20:03.800 --> 20:04.800
But…

20:05.220 --> 20:06.760
faced with this,

20:07.260 --> 20:10.770
I'm sure even you would
have had a tough time.

20:15.020 --> 20:18.190
I would have been fine, idiot!

20:19.860 --> 20:23.320
The rumor has not been confirmed,
but the reinforcements saw signs

20:23.360 --> 20:26.740
that point to the existence
of some horrible monstrosity.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.200
Holy crap, what is this?

20:29.790 --> 20:31.870
What kind of monster could
cause such violence?

20:32.500 --> 20:34.920
I'd hate to face off
against this thing.

20:36.580 --> 20:37.590
Hey, what's this?

20:38.630 --> 20:41.670
Is it a part of the monster
Spring Mustachio fought?

20:41.920 --> 20:43.800
There may have been
a territorial dispute

20:43.800 --> 20:44.930
between the monsters…

20:45.890 --> 20:48.930
Seems like there's definitely
"something" here.

20:50.270 --> 20:54.480
We must continue our investigation
and maintain vigilance over City Z.

20:56.940 --> 20:58.190
Hey, did you hear?

20:58.440 --> 21:01.320
There are monsters living
in the City Z ghost town.

21:01.530 --> 21:05.860
Yeah, rumor has it the toughest ones
are secretly plotting something.

21:06.110 --> 21:10.490
No, no. Not that rumor.
It's about a more dangerous monster.

21:10.620 --> 21:11.790
What's that?

21:11.910 --> 21:12.790
You didn't hear?

21:12.790 --> 21:15.040
I hear the place
has now become terrifying

21:15.080 --> 21:17.330
for both humans and monsters.

21:18.670 --> 21:22.840
THE TERRIFYING CITY

22:54.470 --> 22:57.930
Master, I filled in the holes
in front of the house.

22:58.020 --> 22:59.520
Oh, thanks!

22:59.940 --> 23:00.940
Also,

23:00.980 --> 23:05.860
MYSTERY MONSTER DEFEATS
CLASS A HEROES
your rank has gone up
from last place, 388th, to 342nd.

23:05.940 --> 23:08.820
Oh? Because of that Panic guy?

23:09.030 --> 23:10.150
He boosted my ranking.

23:12.370 --> 23:13.990
So it's been a week now.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.620
Have you done anything?

23:15.910 --> 23:17.870
No, not yet.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.290
I guess it's only been a week.

23:20.040 --> 23:23.500
I'm still ranked last in Class S
for ability…in 17th place.

23:24.540 --> 23:27.050
Sounds like you've still got
a lot of training to do, Genos.

23:29.130 --> 23:32.720
But in the public polls,
for popularity I rank number six.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.640
Why?!

23:35.260 --> 23:38.140
"A genius who, at the tender age
of 19, made his debut in Class S."

23:38.390 --> 23:39.390
"He'll do great."

23:39.520 --> 23:40.690
"He's so handsome."

23:40.940 --> 23:43.810
"Love how he refuses to do
media interviews. Very cool."

23:43.980 --> 23:45.020
Those kinds of comments.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.530
You're not embarrassed
to read those out loud?

23:48.860 --> 23:51.990
These comments are based on
impressions from my photo,

23:51.990 --> 23:54.160
not evaluations of me.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.530
I think nothing of them.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.870
Oh yeah?

23:57.120 --> 23:58.120
They continue.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.160
"The Cyborg Prince."

23:59.250 --> 24:01.830
"Behind the steely exterior,
I feel his fragile self."

24:02.000 --> 24:03.370
"Among the top five
handsomest heroes."

24:03.420 --> 24:04.540
Enough already!

24:05.750 --> 24:07.420
NEXT EPISODE:
THE SURPREME DISCIPLE
This is Blizzard.

24:07.420 --> 24:10.010
NEXT EPISODE:
THE SURPREME DISCIPLE
Perhaps you know me better as
"Blizzard from Hell?"

24:11.130 --> 24:14.050
Well, I only had a bit part
this episode.

24:14.050 --> 24:16.100
Next on One-Punch Man
is episode 7,

24:16.100 --> 24:17.470
"The Ultimate Disciple."

24:19.100 --> 24:21.060
The Blizzard Bunch will
finally make its appearance.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.980
Miss Blizzard, we're not scheduled
to go on next week!

24:23.980 --> 24:24.940
That can't be right!
