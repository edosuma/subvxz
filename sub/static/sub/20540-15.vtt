00:40.934 --> 00:44.266
- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:44.266 --> 00:46.934
I'm John Oliver, thank you
so much for joining us,

00:46.934 --> 00:49.934
and let's dive straight in
with the latest installment

00:49.934 --> 00:52.600
in what we're calling
Stupid Watergate,

00:52.600 --> 00:55.600
something with all the potential
national shame of Watergate,

00:55.600 --> 00:57.133
brought to you
by people too stupid

00:57.133 --> 00:59.433
to grasp the concept of shame.

00:59.433 --> 01:01.767
Now, this week,
former FBI director

01:01.767 --> 01:04.100
and worst person to sit behind
in a movie theater,

01:04.100 --> 01:07.967
James Comey,
got everybody's attention.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.300
- Breaking news tonight:
striking revelations

01:10.300 --> 01:13.400
and allegations
from James Comey, under oath,

01:13.400 --> 01:16.066
telling Congress
he has no doubt he was fired

01:16.066 --> 01:18.667
because of
the Russia investigation.

01:18.667 --> 01:20.734
- Now,
it was undeniably dramatic,

01:20.734 --> 01:22.233
but the notion
that Comey was fired

01:22.233 --> 01:23.567
because of
the Russia investigation

01:23.567 --> 01:26.000
isn't actually new
or controversial.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.100
It is easy to forget,

01:27.100 --> 01:29.233
but Trump himself
suggested as much

01:29.233 --> 01:30.734
in an interview
just a month ago,

01:30.734 --> 01:32.900
so it's more a known fact

01:32.900 --> 01:34.233
that many people choose
to ignore,

01:34.233 --> 01:36.900
like a pet snake
is a character flaw

01:36.900 --> 01:40.233
or DJs aren't doing anything
up there.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.600
But nevertheless, James Comey,

01:42.600 --> 01:44.100
the result of
a mall security guard's

01:44.100 --> 01:46.433
drunken hookup with an oak tree,

01:46.433 --> 01:48.100
did testify before

01:48.100 --> 01:49.433
the senate
intelligence committee,

01:49.433 --> 01:50.900
and within three minutes,

01:50.900 --> 01:52.166
he had forcefully addressed

01:52.166 --> 01:54.600
Trump's initial excuse
for firing him.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.767
- Saying that the organization
was in disarray,

01:57.767 --> 01:59.600
that it was poorly led,

01:59.600 --> 02:04.100
that the workforce had lost
confidence in its leader--

02:04.100 --> 02:06.567
those were lies,
plain and simple.

02:06.567 --> 02:07.900
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.367
Hold on there,
'cause let's be honest here,

02:09.367 --> 02:12.533
Donald Trump's lies
are never plain and simple.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.400
Each one is like
an Everlasting Gobstopper:

02:15.400 --> 02:17.400
you'll never make it
through every layer

02:17.400 --> 02:19.400
because it was produced
by an insane person

02:19.400 --> 02:21.734
who should never be in charge
of anything.

02:21.734 --> 02:23.800
You're a good candy man, Willy,
but the Oompa-Loompas

02:23.800 --> 02:25.266
have been shitting
in the chocolate river,

02:25.266 --> 02:26.734
and you're about to leave
your estate

02:26.734 --> 02:29.233
to the only child
you didn't nearly murder today.

02:29.233 --> 02:32.400
You have no business
running a factory.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.867
And that was just one
of many times

02:34.867 --> 02:36.567
Comey questioned
the president's credibility.

02:36.567 --> 02:38.400
Just listen
to the amazing reason

02:38.400 --> 02:40.567
that Comey gave
for taking detailed notes

02:40.567 --> 02:42.500
on his meetings with Trump.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.233
- I was honestly concerned
that he might lie

02:44.233 --> 02:45.734
about the nature of our meeting,

02:45.734 --> 02:47.934
and so I thought it
really important to document.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.433
- He is describing
his meeting with the president

02:50.433 --> 02:53.934
like a person who thought
he was about to be murdered.

02:53.934 --> 02:55.266
"All of a sudden, we were alone,

02:55.266 --> 02:57.100
"so I texted my location
to a friend

02:57.100 --> 03:00.266
and tried to get some of his DNA
under my fingernails."

03:00.266 --> 03:01.266
[laughter]

03:01.266 --> 03:02.767
And look, it is a good thing

03:02.767 --> 03:04.600
that Comey,
a disgruntled giraffe

03:04.600 --> 03:06.100
who was somehow cursed
by a warlock

03:06.100 --> 03:08.767
to head the FBI, did take notes,

03:08.767 --> 03:10.934
because some of his encounters
with the president

03:10.934 --> 03:13.533
got pretty weird,
like the infamous dinner

03:13.533 --> 03:16.400
where Trump allegedly asked
for his loyalty.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.033
- How unusual is it to have

03:19.033 --> 03:22.567
a one-on-one dinner
with the president?

03:22.567 --> 03:24.633
Did that strike you as odd?

03:24.633 --> 03:26.300
- Yeah, so much so
that I assumed

03:26.300 --> 03:27.834
there would be others,

03:27.834 --> 03:30.166
that he couldn't possibly
be having dinner with me alone.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.734
- Yeah.

03:31.734 --> 03:34.400
He was tricked
into a one-on-one dinner

03:34.400 --> 03:36.734
with Donald Trump,
which is definitely

03:36.734 --> 03:39.400
not the first time
that that has happened.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.734
Comey is just lucky, frankly,
that Trump didn't try and pull

03:41.734 --> 03:44.734
the old "hole in a bucket
of popcorn" trick.

03:44.734 --> 03:47.734
And look, look, let's--
let's all admit,

03:47.734 --> 03:50.400
it is also better to have
a dinner alone with Trump

03:50.400 --> 03:53.066
than have Jared Kushner there
too,

03:53.066 --> 03:57.100
just staring at you silently
with his creepy, dead eyes.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.533
"Oh, is that you, Jared?

03:58.533 --> 03:59.834
"I thought you were a painting

03:59.834 --> 04:01.600
of an orphan
from the Great Depression."

04:01.600 --> 04:03.500
[laughter]

04:03.500 --> 04:06.233
But the truth is,
the most tantalizing moment

04:06.233 --> 04:07.467
may turn out to be the things

04:07.467 --> 04:09.767
that Comey didn't or wasn't able
to say,

04:09.767 --> 04:11.567
like in this exchange.

04:11.567 --> 04:16.033
- Do you believe Donald Trump
colluded with Russia?

04:16.033 --> 04:18.867
- That's a question
I don't think I should answer

04:18.867 --> 04:20.300
in an open setting.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.533
- "Yeah, I can't answer
that question here,

04:22.533 --> 04:24.867
"although I have been screaming
the word 'yes'

04:24.867 --> 04:28.066
"into this paper bag
for the last four weeks,

04:28.066 --> 04:30.900
"which I can submit as evidence
to the committee if required.

04:30.900 --> 04:35.400
I will, however, need to be
provided with a new scream bag."

04:35.400 --> 04:36.767
Now, Comey declining to answer

04:36.767 --> 04:38.900
doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything there.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.567
He could just be operating
out of an abundance of caution,

04:41.567 --> 04:43.066
but there was a moment

04:43.066 --> 04:44.900
where he seemed to hint
at something new,

04:44.900 --> 04:48.233
and it came when discussing
the FBI's lack of surprise

04:48.233 --> 04:50.567
at Attorney General
Jeff Sessions recusing himself

04:50.567 --> 04:52.367
from the Russia investigation.

04:52.367 --> 04:56.400
- Our judgment, as I recall,
was that he was very close to,

04:56.400 --> 04:59.400
and inevitably going to,
recuse himself

04:59.400 --> 05:02.266
for a variety of reasons.

05:02.266 --> 05:03.600
We also were aware of facts

05:03.600 --> 05:05.934
that I can't discuss
in an open setting

05:05.934 --> 05:08.266
that would make
his continued engagement

05:08.266 --> 05:10.066
in a Russia-related
investigation

05:10.066 --> 05:11.400
problematic.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.000
- Now,
that
sounds like a big deal.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.233
If someone asks you

05:15.233 --> 05:16.867
if you've ever had sex
with a turtle,

05:16.867 --> 05:19.033
and you say,
"There are facts about that

05:19.033 --> 05:21.367
I can't discuss
in an open setting,"

05:21.367 --> 05:23.700
the answer is yes,

05:23.700 --> 05:25.700
and the closed setting
you'd prefer to discuss it in

05:25.700 --> 05:28.367
is Eggs-List.com,
a message board

05:28.367 --> 05:32.033
for finding hot, freshly hatched
turtles to have sex with.

05:32.033 --> 05:34.567
Now, all in all,
Comey's testimony appears

05:34.567 --> 05:35.900
pretty damaging
for the White House,

05:35.900 --> 05:37.400
and in the immediate aftermath,

05:37.400 --> 05:41.266
even Fox News was struggling
to spin any positives.

05:41.266 --> 05:44.266
- Politically, I thought it was
very damaging to the president.

05:44.266 --> 05:47.066
- I am concerned
after hearing Jim Comey today.

05:47.066 --> 05:51.734
It was far stronger,
more credible, and more damning

05:51.734 --> 05:54.233
than the statement we got
from Jim Comey yesterday.

05:54.233 --> 05:56.567
- I think
this sort of brings home

05:56.567 --> 05:59.066
the question of
the president's credibility,

05:59.066 --> 06:01.333
which is always a big loss.

06:01.333 --> 06:05.066
- Wow, that is not good,
although at this point,

06:05.066 --> 06:07.734
saying something
"damaged Trump's credibility"

06:07.734 --> 06:08.934
is kind of like saying,

06:08.934 --> 06:10.767
"That graffiti is a real eyesore

06:10.767 --> 06:13.700
on that pile of dead pigeons."

06:13.700 --> 06:16.867
But as--
as for the president himself,

06:16.867 --> 06:19.033
he was notably silent
the day of the hearing

06:19.033 --> 06:22.200
but sent a tweet early
the next morning that began,

06:22.200 --> 06:24.700
"Despite so many
false statements and lies,

06:24.700 --> 06:27.200
total and complete
vindication,"

06:27.200 --> 06:29.200
and just think
about what he's saying there.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.200
Trump is essentially claiming
that he's been vindicated

06:32.200 --> 06:34.533
by testimony
he's claiming is false.

06:34.533 --> 06:38.867
At this point, he's become
a walking logical paradox.

06:38.867 --> 06:40.200
I honestly wouldn't be surprised

06:40.200 --> 06:42.066
if he just starts tweeting
things like,

06:42.066 --> 06:47.233
"I just traveled back in time
and killed myself. Very unfair!"

06:47.233 --> 06:49.567
And in a press conference
later that day,

06:49.567 --> 06:52.066
Trump reiterated his claim
that Comey had lied,

06:52.066 --> 06:54.700
which prompted
an obvious question.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.734
- Would you be willing
to speak under oath

06:56.734 --> 06:58.400
to give your version--

06:58.400 --> 07:00.033
- One hundred percent.

07:00.033 --> 07:02.066
- So if Robert Mueller wanted
to speak with you about that--

07:02.066 --> 07:03.200
- I would be glad to tell him

07:03.200 --> 07:05.233
exactly what I just told you,
Jim.

07:05.233 --> 07:06.600
- Holy shit.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.734
Trump just volunteered
to testify under oath,

07:09.734 --> 07:11.166
putting himself in a situation

07:11.166 --> 07:13.166
where it's his word
against Comey's,

07:13.166 --> 07:14.867
and it was notable
that for all the pushback

07:14.867 --> 07:16.533
Republican senators gave Comey,

07:16.533 --> 07:19.867
they never once questioned
his honesty and his integrity

07:19.867 --> 07:22.266
or challenged
his characterization of Trump

07:22.266 --> 07:23.800
as a liar,

07:23.800 --> 07:26.867
so why did Trump just seem
to expose himself like that?

07:26.867 --> 07:27.867
I don't know.

07:27.867 --> 07:30.200
I cannot explain his behavior.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.200
Jane Goodall could not explain
his behavior.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.867
She could watch Trump
for a decade

07:34.867 --> 07:37.700
and eventually conclude,
"I don't know.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.467
"I think
it's a cocktail of insecurity,

07:39.467 --> 07:40.800
"horniness, and malice,

07:40.800 --> 07:44.200
"but which is in control
of which is beyond me.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.033
"I miss the integrity
and emotional intelligence

07:47.033 --> 07:49.400
of the apes."

07:49.400 --> 07:51.734
But perhaps
the most infuriating response

07:51.734 --> 07:53.400
to Comey's revelations this week

07:53.400 --> 07:54.967
came from
House Speaker Paul Ryan,

07:59.233 --> 08:04.633

was truly pathetic.

08:04.633 --> 08:06.400
- The president's new at this.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.233
He's new to government,

08:08.233 --> 08:10.233
and so
he probably wasn't steeped

08:10.233 --> 08:14.166
in the long-running protocols
that establish the relationships

08:14.166 --> 08:17.166
between DOJ, FBI,

08:21.367 --> 08:24.200
- There are so many problems
with what he just said,

08:24.200 --> 08:26.367
but the main one is that
there are undeniably times

08:26.367 --> 08:29.367
when the excuse
"he's new to this" is fair.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.867
If you work at a daycare,
and on your first day,

08:31.867 --> 08:35.133
you mix up the three Olivias,
no big deal.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.633
You're new here.

08:36.633 --> 08:39.867
But if on your first day,
you set up a baby fight club,

08:39.867 --> 08:41.700
that is not okay,

08:41.700 --> 08:45.033
and you should've known that
before you started.

08:45.033 --> 08:47.033
And a president attempting

08:47.033 --> 08:50.200
to shut down an investigation
into a subordinate

08:50.200 --> 08:53.200
is pretty firmly
the latter option here,

08:53.200 --> 08:55.567

to look into that,

08:55.567 --> 08:57.900

10:18.400 --> 10:20.567
but Prime Minister Theresa May
called it early.

10:20.567 --> 10:22.400
It's called a snap election,

10:22.400 --> 10:24.567
and she did it
to consolidate her power,

10:24.567 --> 10:27.433
although it didn't quite
work out that way.

10:27.433 --> 10:30.066
- A disaster for the UK
prime minister tonight.

10:30.066 --> 10:33.500
Theresa May's Conservatives
suffering a stunning setback.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.767
- Her goal of
securing a stronger hand

10:35.767 --> 10:39.266
for Brexit negotiations
has backfired spectacularly.

10:39.266 --> 10:42.633
The snap general election has
ended with a hung parliament.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.767
- Yes, this was a clusterfuck,

10:44.767 --> 10:46.100
or to be more precise,

10:46.100 --> 10:49.600
a crumpet-fuck
of epic proportions.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.100
Theresa May is hanging on
to her job by a thread.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.100
So to stay in power,
she's attempting to cut

10:54.100 --> 10:55.934
a distasteful deal with the DUP,

10:55.934 --> 10:57.600
a hard-line, anti-gay,

10:57.600 --> 10:59.266
anti-abortion party
in Northern Ireland,

10:59.266 --> 11:01.433
which has opened her up
to even more criticism.

11:01.433 --> 11:04.100
Meanwhile, there are rumors
of a leadership challenge

11:04.100 --> 11:07.266
from within her own party
by Boris Johnson,

11:07.266 --> 11:09.300
a grown man
who perpetually looks

11:09.300 --> 11:11.233
like a seven-year-old
who's just spun in circles

11:11.233 --> 11:14.233
for two minutes
and is about to throw up,

11:14.233 --> 11:16.066
and while Theresa May did manage

11:16.066 --> 11:18.066
to win reelection
in her own constituency,

11:18.066 --> 11:20.400
even that came
with some humiliation,

11:20.400 --> 11:21.734
and let me explain:

11:21.734 --> 11:23.734
British politics has
a proud tradition

11:23.734 --> 11:26.900
of having all candidates
standing together on the stage

11:26.900 --> 11:29.734
when the results are announced,
even joke candidates,

11:29.734 --> 11:31.900
which means
that on election night,

11:31.900 --> 11:34.567
as her party was dealt
a massive blow,

11:34.567 --> 11:37.734
the prime minister, here,
had to stand on stage

11:37.734 --> 11:41.100
alongside Elmo,
who got three votes,

11:41.100 --> 11:42.767
as well as Howling Laud Hope

11:42.767 --> 11:45.100
of the Monster Raving
Loony Party,

11:45.100 --> 11:46.934
who got 119 votes,

11:46.934 --> 11:48.934
and if you've noticed this guy,

11:48.934 --> 11:51.633
wait till you hear his name.

11:56.767 --> 11:59.300
[laughter]

12:00.266 --> 12:04.433
- Oh--oh, you can roll your eyes
all you like, Theresa.

12:04.433 --> 12:08.100
Your evening just found a way
to get a lot worse.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.867
And for the record,
Lord Buckethead is this guy,

12:11.867 --> 12:15.400
an intergalactic space lord
who ran on a platform of,

12:15.400 --> 12:18.066
among other things,
the abolition of the Lords,

12:18.066 --> 12:20.400
brackets, "except me,"

12:20.400 --> 12:23.066
and "stop selling arms
to Saudi Arabia;

12:23.066 --> 12:26.066
start buying lasers
from Lord Buckethead."

12:26.066 --> 12:27.900
And he did this
all while looking

12:27.900 --> 12:31.066
like Darth Vader fucked
an Amazon Echo.

12:31.066 --> 12:33.900
What I'm saying is--
what I'm saying is,

12:33.900 --> 12:35.900
British politics,
when done well,

12:35.900 --> 12:38.400
can be very fun.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.734
So--so how did Theresa May
suffer such a setback

12:41.734 --> 12:43.400
in an election
that just two months ago

12:43.400 --> 12:45.233
she was predicted to win
in a landslide?

12:45.233 --> 12:46.900
Well, among other things,

12:46.900 --> 12:49.266
she ran a campaign
full of mistakes, flip-flops,

12:49.266 --> 12:51.934
and uninspiring moments
like this.

12:51.934 --> 12:53.867
- What's the naughtiest thing
you ever did?

12:53.867 --> 12:56.934
- Oh, goodness, me.

12:56.934 --> 12:59.433
Well, I suppose...

12:59.433 --> 13:01.867
Gosh, do you know,
I'm not quite sure.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.033
I have to confess,
when me and my friends

13:04.033 --> 13:06.600
sort of used to run
through the fields of wheat,

13:06.600 --> 13:08.533
the farmers weren't too pleased
about that.

13:08.533 --> 13:12.033
[laughter]

13:12.033 --> 13:13.533
- The naughtiest thing
you've ever done

13:13.533 --> 13:16.367
is run through a wheat field?

13:16.367 --> 13:20.367
I cannot imagine a scenario
when that is ever naughty

13:20.367 --> 13:22.400
unless you're doing it
while high on PCP

13:22.400 --> 13:25.066
and fucking a cantaloupe.

13:25.066 --> 13:27.400
Now, one of the beneficiaries
of the election

13:27.400 --> 13:30.066
was May's key opponent,
Jeremy Corbyn.

13:30.066 --> 13:31.567
He and Britain's Labor party

13:31.567 --> 13:33.734
vastly outperformed
expectations,

13:33.734 --> 13:35.567
despite taking
some rough treatment

13:35.567 --> 13:37.467
from the British tabloids,
so this was

13:37.467 --> 13:39.400
a genuinely impressive
performance for Corbyn,

13:39.400 --> 13:42.400
only slightly undercut
by one awkward moment

13:42.400 --> 13:44.433
with a fellow party leader.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.900
- Mr. Corbyn was beaming
as he arrived

13:46.900 --> 13:49.567
at his own count
in Islington last night,

13:49.567 --> 13:52.734
though his high-five
with Emily Thornberry

13:52.734 --> 13:56.166
went a touch too far, perhaps.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.600
[crowd groans]

13:58.600 --> 14:00.967
- That--
that's not ideal.

14:00.967 --> 14:02.266
That's not ideal.

14:02.266 --> 14:04.600
A celebratory moment
immediately followed

14:04.600 --> 14:08.000
by history's most catastrophic
rounding of second base.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.433
[laughter]

14:09.433 --> 14:11.867
And look, look,
I do not agree with Theresa May

14:11.867 --> 14:14.867
on the vast majority of issues,
although I will say,

14:14.867 --> 14:17.533
the tone of some of the coverage
surrounding her setback

14:17.533 --> 14:19.767
was more than a little sexist.

14:19.767 --> 14:23.200
- The face of Theresa May:
the look of a woman defeated,

14:23.200 --> 14:24.533
heavily made up

14:24.533 --> 14:26.700
as if she'd been in tears
earlier,

14:26.700 --> 14:29.567
her voice cracking at times,
I thought.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.233
- "And if there's one thing
I can recognize,

14:31.233 --> 14:33.567
"it's the look
of a woman defeated.

14:33.567 --> 14:35.233
"It's the one
my female colleagues give me

14:35.233 --> 14:38.066
"any time I tell them
to smile more in the office.

14:38.066 --> 14:39.900
"Anyway, back to you
in the studio, Angela.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.734
"See, there it is,
that's the exact expression

14:41.734 --> 14:43.233
"I'm referring to there.

14:43.233 --> 14:46.734
Cheer up, old girl.
You look absolutely miserable."

14:46.734 --> 14:49.233
Now, the whole point
of May calling this election

14:49.233 --> 14:51.500
early in the first place
was to strengthen her hand

14:51.500 --> 14:52.967
going into Brexit negotiations,

14:52.967 --> 14:55.734
and though it has done
the exact opposite of that,

14:55.734 --> 14:57.233
tonight, let's take a look

14:57.233 --> 14:59.066
at what those talks
are going to involve,

14:59.066 --> 15:02.433
because talks are set to begin
a week from tomorrow,

15:02.433 --> 15:05.433
and they need to be completed
by March of 2019,

15:05.433 --> 15:07.600
which is not a lot of time
to do something

15:07.600 --> 15:11.000
incredibly important
and incredibly complicated.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.200
- Britain wants out of the EU,

15:14.200 --> 15:17.700
but we've been in
for more than 40 years,

15:17.700 --> 15:19.533
with our countries,
our systems becoming

15:19.533 --> 15:21.200
more and more tangled up
with each other,

15:21.200 --> 15:25.033
more and more enmeshed,
and we only have two years

15:25.033 --> 15:27.066
to hammer out a divorce deal.

15:27.066 --> 15:30.567
- It's true, this is going to be
a messy, complicated divorce,

15:30.567 --> 15:31.700
and it's a rough analogy,

15:31.700 --> 15:33.066
but try and think of it
this way:

15:33.066 --> 15:36.567
imagine if Florida wanted
to secede from the union.

15:36.567 --> 15:37.567
Nice, right?

15:37.567 --> 15:39.233
But think about everything

15:39.233 --> 15:40.567
that that would actually entail.

15:40.567 --> 15:42.900
Florida has a border
with Alabama and Georgia

15:42.900 --> 15:44.400
that would potentially need
patrolling.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.400
Any Florida goods
going over that border,

15:46.400 --> 15:48.066
like oranges or meth,

15:48.066 --> 15:50.500
would likely be subject
to tariffs,

15:50.500 --> 15:51.633
and then you'd need to decide

15:51.633 --> 15:52.900
whether Floridians
would be welcome

15:52.900 --> 15:54.233
to live and work in the U.S.

15:54.233 --> 15:55.900
or Americans welcome in Florida,

15:55.900 --> 15:58.066
and that's before you even get
into the tricky question

15:58.066 --> 16:00.400
of who's forced
to take custody of Hulk Hogan.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.734
The point is,

16:01.734 --> 16:03.400
Florida and the U.S.
splitting up would be

16:03.400 --> 16:05.400
an immensely complicated
process.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.734
It's a great idea,
and we should definitely do it,

16:07.734 --> 16:09.433
but it wouldn't be easy,

16:09.433 --> 16:12.700
and Brexit is going to be
vastly more difficult

16:12.700 --> 16:14.533
and more expensive too.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.867
For a start,
a so-called divorce bill

16:16.867 --> 16:18.200
needs to be negotiated,

16:18.200 --> 16:20.367
where the UK settles
financial commitments

16:20.367 --> 16:22.700
that they made
while a part of the EU,

16:22.700 --> 16:26.700
and some estimates put that
as high as 100 billion euros.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.200
And that's just the beginning:
now, broadly speaking,

16:29.200 --> 16:30.867
the question
is whether the UK will have

16:30.867 --> 16:33.533
a hard or a soft Brexit,

16:33.533 --> 16:35.533
and that is a concept
that British TV

16:35.533 --> 16:37.700
has repeatedly attempted
to explain,

16:37.700 --> 16:41.166
sometimes in the most ludicrous
possible fashion.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.066
- The options range
from a harder Brexit

16:43.066 --> 16:45.200
to a softer Brexit,

16:45.200 --> 16:48.233
and what better way to judge
people's political tastes

16:48.233 --> 16:51.867
than through cheese:
hard or soft?

16:51.867 --> 16:53.066
- What?

16:53.066 --> 16:54.166
[laughter]

16:54.166 --> 16:55.500
What better way to judge

16:55.500 --> 16:57.567
people's political tastes
than through cheese?

16:57.567 --> 16:59.066
I don't know;
off the top of my head,

16:59.066 --> 17:01.900
literally all other ways.

17:01.900 --> 17:05.066
Even BuzzFeed would find
"Tell Us What Cheese You Like,

17:05.066 --> 17:07.066
And We'll Tell You
What Brexit You Want"

17:07.066 --> 17:09.567
to be too stupid
for one of their quizzes,

17:09.567 --> 17:11.500
and they've run
the actual quizzes

17:11.500 --> 17:14.333
"Should You Stick This
Up Your Butt?"

17:14.333 --> 17:17.367
and "Which Olsen Twin
Are You?"--which is ridiculous,

17:17.367 --> 17:18.700
because,
as we addressed last week,

17:18.700 --> 17:20.867
there is only one Olsen twin.

17:20.867 --> 17:23.867
It's a gigantic conspiracy.
You're being lied to.

17:23.867 --> 17:25.867
I just don't know why yet.

17:25.867 --> 17:27.567
But anyway, put that aside.

17:27.567 --> 17:31.033
That report actually had
some useful information in it,

17:31.033 --> 17:32.367
if you can ignore the fact

17:32.367 --> 17:35.033
that it is pointlessly written
on cheese.

17:35.033 --> 17:38.867
- A harder Brexit would see
the UK leave the single market.

17:38.867 --> 17:41.033
The UK would then trade
with the EU

17:41.033 --> 17:43.867
under
World Trade Organization rules.

17:43.867 --> 17:46.200
We'd also have more of a say
over our borders

17:46.200 --> 17:48.734
so we could control immigration.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.900
A softer Brexit would see the UK

17:50.900 --> 17:53.066
remain part
of the single market,

17:53.066 --> 17:55.900
there'd be continued free access
for EU nationals,

17:55.900 --> 18:00.233
but Britain's exports wouldn't
be subject to border checks.

18:00.233 --> 18:02.066
- And that's actually
a pretty decent explainer,

18:02.066 --> 18:03.400
although I really must insist

18:03.400 --> 18:06.400
that cheese
is distractingly weird.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.233
Really, the only time
cheese should be used

18:08.233 --> 18:10.900
as a framing device
is if you are a mouse couple

18:10.900 --> 18:12.333
posing for wedding photos,

18:12.333 --> 18:14.333
and even then,
it's a little Pinterest-y.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.834
I'm--I'm just saying,

18:15.834 --> 18:18.166
it's never a bad idea
to ask yourself,

18:18.166 --> 18:20.667
if you somehow couldn't
Instagram your wedding,

18:20.667 --> 18:22.533
would you still
be getting married?

18:22.533 --> 18:24.200
Anyway.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.533
The point is,
within that hard-soft framework

18:26.533 --> 18:29.367
are decisions
that will affect a lot of lives.

18:29.367 --> 18:31.700
Take immigration:
there are currently 3 million

18:31.700 --> 18:33.367
EU citizens living in the UK

18:33.367 --> 18:36.367
and 1.2 million British citizens
living in Europe,

18:36.367 --> 18:38.533
all of whom presumably
wouldn't mind knowing

18:38.533 --> 18:40.033
where they're going to be
allowed to live

18:40.033 --> 18:42.834
and what their rights might be
in just two years' time.

18:42.834 --> 18:44.367
Then there's the issue
of Northern Ireland,

18:44.367 --> 18:47.200
which is part of the UK
and will therefore Brexit,

18:47.200 --> 18:50.700
but the Republic of Ireland
is part of the EU,

18:50.700 --> 18:53.533
and any effort to stop policing
the border between them

18:53.533 --> 18:55.900
will be difficult because there
is a long and painful history

18:55.900 --> 18:58.567
of tensions
on the subject of that divide.

18:58.567 --> 19:00.233
The idea of border checkpoints

19:00.233 --> 19:02.233
suddenly splitting communities
again

19:02.233 --> 19:03.567
could quickly become
a nightmare,

19:03.567 --> 19:06.066
so this is a huge,
delicate problem,

19:06.066 --> 19:07.900
which one news report
illustrated

19:07.900 --> 19:10.934
in the most whimsical way
possible.

19:10.934 --> 19:13.166
- Pip the dog goes
on a brief excursion

19:13.166 --> 19:15.834
to the Republic of Ireland...

19:15.834 --> 19:18.000
and returns
to the United Kingdom

19:18.000 --> 19:19.133
just as easily.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.300
- This dog, he had no license

19:21.300 --> 19:22.300
to cross the border,

19:22.300 --> 19:23.834
so he'll have to go to jail now.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.633
He's an illegal immigrant.

19:25.633 --> 19:27.333
- Now, yes.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.400
Yes, now--
yes, that is, undeniably,

19:29.400 --> 19:30.600
an objectively silly way

19:30.600 --> 19:31.800
to illustrate
an important issue,

19:31.800 --> 19:33.033
although I will say
I'm not sure

19:33.033 --> 19:34.266
there is a better metaphor

19:34.266 --> 19:35.266
for the British Empire

19:35.266 --> 19:37.333
than a jolly chap named Pip

19:37.333 --> 19:40.033
shows fuck-all respect
for a border.

19:40.033 --> 19:42.533
"This bit of land here is mine.
This one too.

19:42.533 --> 19:45.867
This part is very fun
to play around in."

19:45.867 --> 19:46.867
And we haven't even got

19:46.867 --> 19:48.033
to what may be the most

19:48.033 --> 19:49.100
difficult issue of all here,

19:49.100 --> 19:50.467
and that is trade,

19:50.467 --> 19:52.367
because pulling out
of the EU single market

19:52.367 --> 19:54.200
without striking
a favorable trade deal

19:54.200 --> 19:56.367
could expose UK products
to high tariffs,

19:56.367 --> 19:58.867
and that is especially worrisome
for farmers,

19:58.867 --> 20:02.233
since around 2/3
of the UK's agricultural exports

20:02.233 --> 20:04.233
go to the EU, not to mention

20:04.233 --> 20:06.400
the significant
EU farm subsidies

20:06.400 --> 20:08.900
that would be lost,
so it's frankly no wonder

20:08.900 --> 20:10.600
that farmers are concerned.

20:10.600 --> 20:14.467
- Andrew Baugh's family
have farmed here since 1947.

20:14.467 --> 20:16.400
If we leave
without a trade deal,

20:16.400 --> 20:18.333
he'll be badly hit.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.066
- We'd have a job to export
things because of the tariffs,

20:21.066 --> 20:23.066
particularly with something
like these sheep,

20:23.066 --> 20:25.166
which 1/3
of all lambs in the country

20:25.166 --> 20:26.500
need to be exported.

20:26.500 --> 20:30.400
The whole food industry,
I believe, is at risk.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.567
[laughter]

20:32.567 --> 20:33.900
- [unintelligible]

20:33.900 --> 20:35.600
- Yeah,
we're gonna have a rub now.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.900
That's what we do in life.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.767
- Now--now, listen.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.433
Could they have cut
out of that interview

20:40.433 --> 20:42.600
before the pig started grinding
on that post?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.767
Yes, but they didn't,
because they knew

20:44.767 --> 20:46.600
that twerking pig
may actually be

20:46.600 --> 20:50.433
the perfect embodiment
of the entire Brexit situation:

20:50.433 --> 20:51.767
it's in motion already,

20:51.767 --> 20:53.433
we're all powerless to stop it,

20:53.433 --> 20:55.600
and it is impossible
to look away.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.100
[laughter]

20:57.100 --> 20:59.100
And as for how
the British economy will fare

20:59.100 --> 21:01.934
outside of EU-negotiated
trade agreements,

21:01.934 --> 21:04.266
that is also very much unclear.

21:04.266 --> 21:06.400
Some argue
that things could work out great

21:06.400 --> 21:07.467
and that no matter what,

21:07.467 --> 21:09.133
British products
are so desirable,

21:09.133 --> 21:11.567
they will find eager customers
all around the world,

21:11.567 --> 21:13.233
and maybe that's true.

21:13.233 --> 21:16.266
Maybe pork pies,
Marmite, mushy peas,

21:16.266 --> 21:18.066
and undiagnosed
clinical depression

21:18.066 --> 21:20.734
will all take the planet
by storm,

21:20.734 --> 21:23.400
and sure, that is technically--
technically possible,

21:23.400 --> 21:25.066
but there is a massive amount
of work to do

21:25.066 --> 21:26.400
before that can happen.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.734
For instance,
the UK will need to decide

21:28.734 --> 21:31.533
which EU laws regulating
many of its industries

21:31.533 --> 21:32.967
it'll choose to keep
on everything

21:32.967 --> 21:35.233
from workers' rights
to environmental protection.

21:35.233 --> 21:37.900
It'll also likely need to set up
its own regulatory agencies

21:37.900 --> 21:40.066
to replace the EU bodies
that it's been relying on,

21:40.066 --> 21:42.600
and it may also need
to negotiate new treaties

21:42.600 --> 21:45.934
to replace
the 759 EU broker deals

21:45.934 --> 21:47.600
that it will immediately
be excluded from,

21:47.600 --> 21:50.266
governing everything
from wine to nuclear power

21:50.266 --> 21:52.934
to the 1981 bilateral agreement
with Iceland

21:52.934 --> 21:55.600
concerning the trade
of sheep meat and goat meat.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.867
What I'm trying to say is,
any single part of Brexit

21:58.867 --> 22:00.333
is a mountainous task,

22:00.333 --> 22:03.433
and that is before
you get to the tiny little bits

22:03.433 --> 22:06.767
that you understandably haven't
even thought might be a problem.

22:06.767 --> 22:09.433
- 250,000 dogs and cats

22:09.433 --> 22:12.367
go across the British Channel
every year.

22:12.367 --> 22:14.533
Trying to work out
how the pet passports work,

22:14.533 --> 22:17.467
that would take
several months of negotiation.

22:17.467 --> 22:19.066
- He's right.

22:19.066 --> 22:22.734
They even have to work out
the issue of pet passports,

22:22.734 --> 22:25.233
and while they are
a genuine logistical concern,

22:25.233 --> 22:27.400
pet passports do also sound
like they belong

22:27.400 --> 22:30.066
to real asshole cats and dogs.

22:30.066 --> 22:32.233
"I mean,
technically, I'm a Persian,

22:32.233 --> 22:36.333
but I consider myself more
a citizen of the world."

22:36.333 --> 22:37.633
Fuck you, Muffin.

22:37.633 --> 22:39.900
You still use your mouth
to clean your butt.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.400
You're not better than me.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.900
You're not better than me!

22:43.900 --> 22:46.734
And remember, the entire
Brexit deal with the EU

22:46.734 --> 22:49.433
needs to be finalized
within just two years,

22:49.433 --> 22:51.600
and if you're thinking, well,
what if they don't get it done

22:51.600 --> 22:54.400
in that time,
well, this happens.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.600
- If there's no deal,
that leaves only one option:

22:57.600 --> 22:59.300
the cliff edge.

22:59.300 --> 23:00.700
[laughter]

23:00.700 --> 23:03.700
- The cliff edge describes
the reality

23:03.700 --> 23:06.266
of one day being in the EU,

23:06.266 --> 23:07.934
with everything that that means,

23:07.934 --> 23:11.700
and the next day being out of it
with no deal.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.533
- You know,
there is exactly one instance

23:13.533 --> 23:15.367
in which
the melodramatic stock footage

23:15.367 --> 23:17.367
of an old-timey car
flying off a cliff

23:17.367 --> 23:19.200
is appropriate
for news broadcast,

23:19.200 --> 23:22.567
and congratulations,
you have all just witnessed it,

23:22.567 --> 23:24.066
because if there is no deal,

23:24.066 --> 23:26.533
everything,
from tariffs to immigration,

23:26.533 --> 23:27.600
will basically default

23:27.600 --> 23:29.734
to the harshest possible
scenario,

23:29.734 --> 23:31.900
which could destabilize
the entire country,

23:31.900 --> 23:33.734
and look, in theory,

23:33.734 --> 23:36.233
they could get an extension
on the negotiation,

23:36.233 --> 23:39.233
but that would require
all 27 EU members

23:39.233 --> 23:40.734
to unanimously approve it,

23:40.734 --> 23:43.233
and I would not rely
on that happening.

23:43.233 --> 23:46.533
The EU has a vested interest
in making this negotiation

23:46.533 --> 23:48.100
as difficult as possible,

23:48.100 --> 23:51.066
because however much they may
value the UK as a partner,

23:51.066 --> 23:55.100
they need to dissuade any other
countries from pulling out,

23:55.100 --> 23:57.100
and the EU is already taking
a firm line.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.734
For instance,
after the Brexit vote,

23:59.734 --> 24:01.600
Boris Johnson,
a man with the face

24:01.600 --> 24:03.100
of a Roald Dahl character

24:03.100 --> 24:06.100
and the uncomfortable racism
of a Roald Dahl,

24:06.100 --> 24:08.266
claims that our policy

24:08.266 --> 24:10.433
is having our cake
and eating it.

24:10.433 --> 24:15.500
Well, watch EU President
Donald Tusk dismantle that idea.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.033
- To all who believe in it,

24:18.033 --> 24:20.700
I propose a simple experiment.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.367
Buy a cake, eat it,

24:22.367 --> 24:24.367
and see if it is still there
on the plate.

24:24.367 --> 24:26.700
[laughter]

24:26.700 --> 24:29.900
There will be no cakes
on the table.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.900
For anyone.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.500
There will be
only salt and vinegar.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.567
- Ouch.

24:36.567 --> 24:38.900
Ouch, Donald, ouch.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.567
Nothing but salt and vinegar.

24:40.567 --> 24:41.734
That is some tough talk,

24:41.734 --> 24:44.233
although
someone should probably tell him

24:44.233 --> 24:47.734
that British people absolutely
love salt and vinegar.

24:47.734 --> 24:49.233
Just look
at all of our variations

24:49.233 --> 24:50.734
on salt and vinegar crisps.

24:50.734 --> 24:52.900
So to be honest,
threatening the British

24:52.900 --> 24:55.734
by saying there will be only
salt and vinegar on the table

24:55.734 --> 24:57.400
is like threatening the French
by saying

24:57.400 --> 24:59.900
there will only be
wine and baguettes,

24:59.900 --> 25:01.400
or threatening the Swiss
by saying

25:01.400 --> 25:04.100
there will only be
chocolate and Nazi gold.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.266
Those are
their two favorite things.

25:06.266 --> 25:08.934
They like those equally.

25:08.934 --> 25:12.867
The fact is, the UK currently
faces a daunting task.

25:12.867 --> 25:14.867
The pound has suffered
since the Brexit vote,

25:14.867 --> 25:18.200
and Theresa May seems to have
fatally weakened her position

25:18.200 --> 25:19.533
going into the negotiations,

25:19.533 --> 25:22.033
making it harder for her
to enact her plan,

25:22.033 --> 25:24.200
although it wasn't clear

25:24.200 --> 25:27.033
what the fuck that plan was
in the first place,

25:27.033 --> 25:29.700
because while she seems
to favor a hard Brexit,

25:29.700 --> 25:33.767
she could be maddeningly evasive
when asked for specifics.

25:33.767 --> 25:35.500
- People talk
about the sort of Brexit

25:35.500 --> 25:36.667
that there is going to be.

25:36.667 --> 25:39.066
Is it hard? Soft?
Is it gray? White?

25:39.066 --> 25:41.400
Actually, we want
a red, white, and blue Brexit.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.266
That is the right Brexit
for the United Kingdom.

25:44.266 --> 25:46.567
- But what does that mean?

25:46.567 --> 25:48.066
You're heading into
a negotiation

25:48.066 --> 25:50.233
that will set the course
for Britain for generations,

25:50.233 --> 25:53.567
and you're naming colors
on the fucking flag.

25:53.567 --> 25:55.900
Forget running through
fields of wheat;

25:55.900 --> 25:58.900
that may be the most ridiculous
thing you've ever said.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.333
And actually, you know what,
I apologize

26:00.333 --> 26:01.533
to that guy from before.

26:01.533 --> 26:03.400
I said
there was literally no worse way

26:03.400 --> 26:04.900
to discuss this
than with cheese,

26:04.900 --> 26:07.900
but I was not counting
on Thatcher in the Rye here

26:07.900 --> 26:12.700
answering a policy question
with a fucking color scheme.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.100
And you know what?

26:14.100 --> 26:17.867
Her vagueness
did not go unnoticed.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.033
In fact, it is not a great sign

26:20.033 --> 26:21.867
that the single most
honest statement

26:21.867 --> 26:23.700
from any candidate
in this election

26:23.700 --> 26:26.533
regarding the difficulty
of the task ahead

26:26.533 --> 26:28.867
came from a man
with a 2-foot bucket

26:28.867 --> 26:30.333
on his head.

26:30.333 --> 26:34.700
- Your prime minister, your MP,
Theresa May,

26:34.700 --> 26:39.200
called this election
about Brexit.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.700
Have we heard from her
what she plans to do

26:41.700 --> 26:43.734
about Brexit?

26:43.734 --> 26:45.567
No.

26:45.567 --> 26:47.567
This is mad.

26:47.567 --> 26:50.233
On Thursday,
you are going to be faced

26:50.233 --> 26:54.400
with Prime Minister May
or Prime Minister Corbyn

26:54.400 --> 26:59.233
against 27 prime ministers
from the European Union.

26:59.233 --> 27:02.333
It will be a shit show.

27:02.333 --> 27:05.367
[laughter, cheers, and applause]

27:06.900 --> 27:09.400
- You know what?
You know what?

27:09.400 --> 27:11.166
I never thought I'd say this,

27:11.166 --> 27:14.834
but that intergalactic
space lord has a point.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.200
Look, in eight days,

27:16.200 --> 27:18.367
the UK is set to walk
into a negotiation

27:18.367 --> 27:19.533
with no real leverage,

27:19.533 --> 27:21.000
no significant
political mandate,

27:21.000 --> 27:22.367
and no coherent plan,

27:22.367 --> 27:24.700
and I don't really have
a solution to that,

27:24.700 --> 27:27.767
but I do have a proposal
for Theresa May,

27:27.767 --> 27:29.066
'cause at this point,

27:29.066 --> 27:31.700
you have basically
fucked everything up,

27:31.700 --> 27:33.200
and your only real chance here

27:33.200 --> 27:34.867
is to utilize
the element of surprise,

27:34.867 --> 27:38.367
so how about, instead of sending
a career negotiator,

27:38.367 --> 27:41.367
why not send someone that there
is no way they would expect?

27:41.367 --> 27:43.033
I'm talking about someone bold,

27:43.033 --> 27:44.533
unafraid to call it how it is,

27:44.533 --> 27:46.033
someone with a firm,

27:46.033 --> 27:48.200
leather-clad grasp
of the issues,

27:48.200 --> 27:51.400
someone with a bucket list
of demands

27:51.400 --> 27:53.734
and an honest,
slightly muffled voice.

27:53.734 --> 27:55.400
That's right,
I'm talking about

27:55.400 --> 27:57.400
the intergalactic space lord
himself.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.900
Here's the question:
is he willing to do it?

27:59.900 --> 28:03.400
Well, yes, he is,
and the reason I know that

28:03.400 --> 28:06.400
is we found him, contacted him,

28:06.400 --> 28:08.800
and actually flew him
here to New York this morning.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.133
[cheers and applause]

28:10.133 --> 28:13.667
Now, could we have just made
a similar costume

28:13.667 --> 28:15.834
and put an intern in it?

28:15.834 --> 28:17.333
Yes.
Shit, we could've done that.

28:17.333 --> 28:18.667
That's a good point.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.834
But we didn't,
and the fact that we didn't

28:20.834 --> 28:23.867
is why I am now able
to present to you here tonight

28:23.867 --> 28:26.033
your new Brexit negotiator.
