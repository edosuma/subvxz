WEBVTT

00:01.125 --> 00:03.669
one should never do
business with family.

00:04.285 --> 00:05.808
But the definition of family

00:05.833 --> 00:08.679
once meant Mom and Dad, 2.5 kids,

00:08.822 --> 00:10.458
and a kitty cat named Jasper.

00:10.687 --> 00:12.132
All under one roof.

00:12.441 --> 00:13.549
But not anymore.

00:14.029 --> 00:16.916
Today my family is my
ex-girl, her white husband,

00:16.941 --> 00:20.219
and the twins we are all
successfully co-parenting.

00:20.766 --> 00:22.885
And if the definition
of family has changed,

00:23.274 --> 00:25.790
then maybe the rules
need to change, too.

00:27.323 --> 00:28.352
All right.

00:28.377 --> 00:30.542
I'll have to go to work after
we finish with this prep.

00:30.567 --> 00:33.114
Yeah, no sweat. Me and
Green Eyes will handle this.

00:33.139 --> 00:34.925
Yeah, we got this, white boy.

00:35.131 --> 00:37.213
Uh, "Josh" is fine, too.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.107
"Josh" sounds whiter than "white boy".

00:39.639 --> 00:41.008
- Cool.
- Let me tell you something, man.

00:41.032 --> 00:42.873
We're gonna make so
much money off of this,

00:43.072 --> 00:44.943
I'll be paying you and
Shay back in no time.

00:44.968 --> 00:48.197
Oh, listen, we look at this
as a long-term investment,

00:48.222 --> 00:52.330
so take your time and, you
know, build business slowly.

00:52.355 --> 00:54.716
Man, forget that. I
got to get this paper.

00:54.741 --> 00:57.670
Now it's time to feed
Brooklyn. Who want it?

00:57.671 --> 00:59.210
- Who want it?!
- Let's go!

01:06.151 --> 01:07.595
- Hey, Josh?
- Uh-huh?

01:07.620 --> 01:08.949
You said long-term, right?

01:09.373 --> 01:10.774
Yeah, I didn't mean this long-term.

01:10.799 --> 01:11.898
No take-backs!

01:16.926 --> 01:19.925
Uh, as I'm sure many of you are aware,

01:19.950 --> 01:21.936
there was an unfortunate tweet sent out

01:21.961 --> 01:24.530
from my personal Twitter
account early this morning

01:24.922 --> 01:27.648
that involved me sharing an
intimate picture of myself

01:27.673 --> 01:29.072
with my children's nanny.

01:29.097 --> 01:30.357
Hm?

01:30.692 --> 01:31.979
Love is a funny thing,

01:32.003 --> 01:35.132
and we find it in the
most unexpected places.

01:35.441 --> 01:38.180
Unfortunately, not
everyone understands this.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.646
Certainly not your wife. Ooh!

01:40.671 --> 01:44.163
But alas, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

01:44.747 --> 01:47.456
And for that I do not apologize.

01:48.597 --> 01:50.726
What I will apologize for is the fact

01:50.751 --> 01:54.060
that all of our clients have
since canceled their accounts

01:54.061 --> 01:55.330
and, effective immediately,

01:55.331 --> 01:57.226
Copeland's will be filing for bankruptcy

01:57.251 --> 01:59.070
and laying off all of our employees.

01:59.071 --> 02:00.100
What the hell?!

02:01.941 --> 02:04.005

02:24.787 --> 02:27.317
About the whole Greg thing.

02:27.701 --> 02:32.230
I should've told you about him.
I was s-scared and messed up.

02:32.321 --> 02:34.160
But I'm having your baby.

02:34.859 --> 02:36.928
And I don't want us to be enemies.

02:38.209 --> 02:39.778
I mean, I don't want that, either.

02:39.803 --> 02:42.602
Whoo! Okay. I am so glad to hear that.

02:42.627 --> 02:44.296
I can put these back on.

02:44.429 --> 02:47.156
'Cause for a second, I didn't know

02:47.181 --> 02:49.320
if we was gonna be wildin' out or what.

02:49.321 --> 02:50.981
You know what? You crazy, Lisa.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.618
But I guess we can be friends.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.909
Real talk?

02:56.949 --> 02:59.379
I don't want my baby to
grow up without a father.

03:00.058 --> 03:02.857
Mine was never around, and it sucked.

03:03.944 --> 03:06.446
My father left to get a Ja
Rule CD and never came back.

03:06.471 --> 03:09.401
Ohh. Ja Rule not even that good.

03:09.411 --> 03:11.540
Matter of fact, the...
the only father I remember

03:11.541 --> 03:14.671
in the hood was Mufasa
from "The Lion King".

03:14.681 --> 03:16.501
- Mm.
- And you see how Scar did him.

03:16.526 --> 03:17.541
Mm.

03:17.551 --> 03:19.280
So fathers ain't doin'
well around my block.

03:20.447 --> 03:21.946
You think you'll be a good daddy?

03:22.113 --> 03:24.094
Come on. Don't do that.
Don't play me like that.

03:24.119 --> 03:25.658
What are you talking about? I got this.

03:25.682 --> 03:27.220
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Well, what... What you gonna come with?

03:27.221 --> 03:29.690
Look. I can change diapers.
I can... I can fix bottles.

03:29.817 --> 03:32.630
And plus, I'll tease 'em. I'll do
the ShammGod cross-over, okay?

03:32.856 --> 03:34.230
We've got this.

03:35.518 --> 03:37.476
All we know is his name is Aaron

03:37.501 --> 03:40.700
and he was last seen outside
a barbershop in Brooklyn.

03:41.042 --> 03:42.308
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:43.209 --> 03:45.518
So sorry about what
happened. Are you okay, babe?

03:45.963 --> 03:48.700
Yeah. Just can't
believe Copeland gave up

03:48.725 --> 03:50.780
his whole fashion
career for some coochie.

03:50.781 --> 03:53.650
Well, yeah. Well, how hot was the nanny?

03:55.051 --> 03:57.313
Remember when I said we
will never have a nanny?

03:57.338 --> 03:58.353
Mm-hmm.

03:58.378 --> 03:59.720
- That bitch is why.
- Gotcha.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.892
You know, this whole
thing has got me thinking.

04:01.916 --> 04:03.416
Maybe I should start working for myself,

04:03.440 --> 04:04.660
start my own fashion line.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.191
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, I might as well.

04:07.201 --> 04:10.061
It's something I've always
wanted to do anyways.

04:10.071 --> 04:12.270
Yeah, I mean,

04:12.271 --> 04:14.311
I guess there won't be a better
time than right now.

04:14.410 --> 04:16.091
You know, Faith said the same thing

04:16.116 --> 04:17.670
when I talking to her about it.

04:17.671 --> 04:19.810
Wait. You talk to Faith
before you talk to me?

04:20.208 --> 04:21.286
Uhh, yeah.

04:21.312 --> 04:24.541
Faith is more interested in
my career than the hot nanny.

04:24.551 --> 04:28.255
Oh, okay, that's not fair to
me or the hot nanny.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.771
Boy, look.

04:31.644 --> 04:33.834
Look at all of these designs
that I've done already.

04:34.453 --> 04:35.582
From back in the day.

04:35.821 --> 04:37.821
- Yeah. Oh, man.
- See?

04:37.972 --> 04:41.160
You spend every free second
drawing these designs.

04:41.161 --> 04:42.830
This is clearly what you want to do.

04:42.831 --> 04:45.370
You know, you're right. Now
it's time for me to do me.

04:45.521 --> 04:47.370
You have been doing this a long time.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.101
Some of these styles are a little old.

04:49.511 --> 04:51.640
Well, maybe I won't use all of them.

04:51.942 --> 04:53.041
I don't know.

04:53.066 --> 04:55.612
You know, if BET ever does
the Bell Biv DeVoe movie,

04:55.637 --> 04:58.441
you'll definitely get a
call. They will call you.

05:02.795 --> 05:04.224
Hey, Bobby!

05:06.273 --> 05:09.039
You're lookin' good, my man.
Whose identity you stealing?

05:09.064 --> 05:10.928
Nah, it ain't even like that, okay?

05:10.936 --> 05:13.459
Bobby's going blue-collar,
man. He's gonna be a bug man.

05:13.484 --> 05:14.875
- What's the scam, though?
- Oh, I know.

05:14.876 --> 05:16.944
He tells the homeowners they
got to be out for four hours

05:16.968 --> 05:19.092
while the fumigate, and then his boys

05:19.117 --> 05:20.652
break in and rob the
place while they're gone.

05:20.676 --> 05:23.276
I mean, that's a good
idea, but I'm going legit.

05:23.286 --> 05:25.085
Ah, you got, like, a real job.

05:25.086 --> 05:26.967
Nah, listen, man.

05:26.992 --> 05:29.340
I brought Bobby by so he
could check out the house,

05:29.365 --> 05:31.133
maybe make a proposal to Mullins.

05:31.158 --> 05:32.777
- What you think, Bobby?
- I mean, that would be good,

05:32.801 --> 05:36.250
but first, I got to find
evidence of roaches or rodents.

05:36.275 --> 05:38.116
Oh, wait a minute. I-I
think I found something.

05:38.496 --> 05:40.972
This right here is droppings
from a German roach.

05:41.636 --> 05:45.235
It's the most common roach
found on the Eastern seaboard.

05:45.236 --> 05:46.505
And this is just nasty.

05:46.530 --> 05:48.308
Mullins needs to clean this place up.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.340
- Hell yeah.
- You're damn right.

05:49.364 --> 05:51.305
- Most foul fucking place...
- Pow!

05:51.306 --> 05:52.745
- Whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

05:53.246 --> 05:56.181
This is a Madagascar hissing roach.

05:56.206 --> 05:57.786
- Oh, hell no. Agh!
- Oh, my God!

05:57.811 --> 05:59.578
Oh, this is a fantastic one.

05:59.603 --> 06:02.116
Wait a minute. This has
been on the entire time.

06:02.126 --> 06:03.313
Everybody breathe slow!

06:05.996 --> 06:09.259
♪ Party West Coast wide,
so what y'all wanna do? ♪

06:09.284 --> 06:13.526
What's this? Ohh! Ooh!
I know what this is.

06:13.536 --> 06:15.465
Now that you tasted my cooking again,

06:15.556 --> 06:17.135
you can't have nothin' else.

06:17.287 --> 06:18.735
I got you hooked, right?

06:18.736 --> 06:21.075
No, but since you mentioned
it, let me get one of those

06:21.076 --> 06:23.745
Snitches Get Ceviches
crab salad sandwiches.

06:23.856 --> 06:25.988
- You got it, pretty lady.
- Josh was telling me

06:26.013 --> 06:27.474
you're starting up
your own fashion line.

06:27.498 --> 06:29.615
- Yo, Shay, you're gonna kill that.
- Thank you.

06:29.818 --> 06:32.015
And I've been doing some
really good work with it, too.

06:32.016 --> 06:35.223
But I realized that I shouldn't
be starting my new business

06:35.248 --> 06:37.140
until Josh and I get that money back

06:37.165 --> 06:38.549
that we gave you for this food truck.

06:38.573 --> 06:39.969
Ah, man, I thought you and Josh

06:39.994 --> 06:42.425
had that, like, disposable
white-people money.

06:42.426 --> 06:44.325
I wish we did, but we don't.

06:44.546 --> 06:47.285
So once this food truck
starts making some money,

06:47.310 --> 06:48.940
then I can start my new business.

06:48.965 --> 06:50.611
So I was just thinking I'd come down

06:50.636 --> 06:52.796
and help out a little bit,
you know, like a consultant.

06:52.904 --> 06:54.973
So, go ahead. Do
whatever it is y'all do.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.083
- All right.
- And just act like I'm not here.

06:58.599 --> 06:59.812
What'll it be, my brother?

06:59.837 --> 07:03.785
Yeah, let me get the
Parole Board Bacon Burger

07:03.786 --> 07:07.050
and a side of French Connection Fries.

07:07.075 --> 07:09.525
Parole Board Bacon Burger.
French Connection Fries.

07:13.726 --> 07:16.193
You got it. That'll be $10.

07:17.326 --> 07:19.165
- You come back now, you hear?
- Thank you.

07:20.531 --> 07:24.200
- Pow!
- Okay, okay, that was a mess.

07:24.225 --> 07:26.301
What?! What did we do wrong?

07:26.326 --> 07:28.649
The man got his food.
We got our money. Holla!

07:28.674 --> 07:31.879
- Guys, you've got to up-sell.
- What's up-sell?

07:31.904 --> 07:34.275
Remember, back in the day, a
customer would come up to you,

07:34.276 --> 07:36.476
say, "I want two rocks for $10"?

07:36.486 --> 07:38.285
- You offered them...
- Four for $15.

07:38.286 --> 07:41.785
Exactly! Up-selling them.
So, a customer comes up.

07:41.810 --> 07:43.355
They say they want to buy some fries.

07:43.356 --> 07:46.155
You offer them a soda for a dollar more.

07:46.156 --> 07:48.425
Now, we buy our soda in bulk,

07:48.426 --> 07:50.765
so that's like, what, 30 cents a can?

07:50.882 --> 07:53.226
Boom. That's where the money come in.

07:53.251 --> 07:55.802
Through the sodas. Everybody know that.

07:55.827 --> 07:57.756
Everybody knows that!

07:58.036 --> 07:59.570
- Everybody know that?
- Mm-hmm.

07:59.595 --> 08:03.175
See, we start offering
two-for-one meals, combos...

08:03.176 --> 08:05.936
mess around and do a loyalty card.

08:05.961 --> 08:07.976
- Mm-hmm.
- And I must say,

08:08.001 --> 08:10.023
you look sexier than ever.

08:10.048 --> 08:11.085
Well, thank you.

08:14.514 --> 08:16.619
Cuzzo. Yes! Yes! Come
on. I'm glad you're here.

08:16.644 --> 08:17.834
- I need your help, yo.
- What's wrong?

08:17.858 --> 08:19.096
You know what I'm sayin'?
You know I'm trying

08:19.120 --> 08:20.898
- to make things right with Lisa, right?
- Yeah.

08:20.922 --> 08:22.325
So I invited her over for dinner.

08:22.438 --> 08:23.707
But... But come look, man.

08:24.428 --> 08:26.126
Yo, what's that smell?

08:29.406 --> 08:30.735
Look at that, man!

08:30.736 --> 08:33.674
Bobby, you can't feed
that to a pregnant woman.

08:33.676 --> 08:35.623
That baby might not
never want to come out.

08:35.648 --> 08:36.875
L-Look, I know, man.

08:36.876 --> 08:38.606
I don't want her to find out that the...

08:38.616 --> 08:41.049
the father of her child
can't even cook a single meal.

08:41.073 --> 08:42.883
Man, don't worry about it.
Uncle Tray Bags is here.

08:42.907 --> 08:44.615
I'm gonna help you out as much as I can.

08:45.177 --> 08:47.685
Okay. Thank you, cuzzo.
Look, I-I've got everything.

08:47.686 --> 08:49.625
I j... I just went
grocery shopping, man.

08:54.046 --> 08:57.061
Oh. Yeah, that's uh,
the child-safety latch.

08:57.235 --> 08:59.495
I-I baby-proofed everything.

08:59.496 --> 09:01.896
I'm talking about the
cabinets, uh, the power outlets.

09:01.906 --> 09:04.435
I even... I even
foam-guarded the sharp edges.

09:04.959 --> 09:07.235
I went a little overboard, huh?

09:07.236 --> 09:08.975
Wh... Ohh.

09:08.976 --> 09:11.245
L-Let me show you something.
Let me show you something.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.346
Um...

09:16.930 --> 09:19.459
I-I wrote a letter to the baby.

09:19.484 --> 09:21.483
- Wow.
- Yeah.

09:21.516 --> 09:22.585
It's, um...

09:23.450 --> 09:26.189
It says how I-I felt when I found out

09:26.474 --> 09:27.584
that I'll be a Dad.

09:27.609 --> 09:28.678
Bro.

09:30.324 --> 09:31.393
That's beautiful.

09:32.221 --> 09:33.911
I mean, like, I-I... I'm...

09:34.340 --> 09:35.959
I learned a lot just watching you.

09:36.394 --> 09:37.405
You know what I'm sayin'?

09:37.430 --> 09:41.851
You missed 15 years of your kids' lives.

09:41.876 --> 09:43.136
Yeah.

09:43.146 --> 09:45.005
And I see how much that means to you

09:45.006 --> 09:47.145
and how hard you work to
be in their lives now and...

09:48.078 --> 09:49.495
I don't want to miss a second.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.912
Look at me. Bobby, you won't.

09:53.055 --> 09:54.920
Oh, oh, let me... let me
show you something else.

09:54.944 --> 09:56.805
Let me show you something else.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.264
Ohh! Look, look.

09:58.289 --> 10:00.095
I'm making a baby bed
with my bare hands.

10:00.096 --> 10:02.756
No, it's called a baby crib.
But God bless you anyway, man.

10:02.766 --> 10:04.765
Listen, I'm gonna be
ready when the baby comes.

10:04.766 --> 10:08.267
I spoke to my, uh, my training
supervisor at Bug Assassins.

10:08.292 --> 10:10.565
- Mm-hmm.
- He said if I do good on my test,

10:10.657 --> 10:12.942
- I can get all the premium accounts.
- Wow.

10:12.967 --> 10:15.105
I'm talking about all
the fast-food restaurants,

10:15.106 --> 10:18.045
the middle-school cafeterias,
like, all the nastiest places!

10:18.046 --> 10:20.093
You're trained to go.
I see that in your eye.

10:20.118 --> 10:22.006
But before you put the
baby in, test it out

10:22.031 --> 10:23.985
with, like, a cantaloupe or
a watermelon or something.

10:23.986 --> 10:25.632
Oh, no, I was just gonna get
somebody else's baby here

10:25.656 --> 10:26.709
and throw it in.

10:26.734 --> 10:28.551
- You was gonna do what?
- I was gonna get somebody else's baby.

10:28.575 --> 10:29.782
No. No, you're not.

10:33.256 --> 10:36.125
♪ It's been a long comin',
mommy, I'm on a roll ♪

10:36.126 --> 10:38.665
♪ Gee, your boy comin' with
the fat, bad roll, huh? ♪

10:38.666 --> 10:40.935
Damn, Shay! Where you
find all these women?

10:41.336 --> 10:43.862
I contacted some of my designer
friends that I've worked with,

10:43.887 --> 10:46.061
then asked them to send me
some of their sexy models.

10:46.086 --> 10:47.555
Because sex sells.

10:47.676 --> 10:49.205
And I'm buyin'.

10:49.206 --> 10:50.246
You know what?

10:50.270 --> 10:52.805
I think I better get
back out there, you know,

10:52.830 --> 10:55.116
make sure they don't take
off with any inventory.

10:55.537 --> 10:57.485
I guess we won't be working today.

11:01.356 --> 11:02.920
Now that things have slowed down,

11:03.483 --> 11:06.189
I'd just like to say to Shay thank you,

11:06.690 --> 11:07.871
'cause we cleaned up.

11:07.896 --> 11:10.397
Well, we all did it together, okay?

11:10.422 --> 11:12.906
And that's just the beginning.
We're just getting started.

11:13.192 --> 11:14.762
Where's Bobby? I thought
he'd be here today.

11:14.786 --> 11:16.548
Nah, he getting ready
to take that bug test.

11:16.573 --> 11:17.802
He's gonna be an exterminator.

11:17.827 --> 11:21.096
What? Bobby with a real
job? I've got to see this.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.801
Nah, for real.

11:23.299 --> 11:25.678
He's taking this whole
daddy thing serious.

11:25.703 --> 11:27.838
Dad thing? Wh... Who
he having a baby with?

11:27.996 --> 11:30.766
- With Lisa.
- That heifer? Hell nah.

11:30.933 --> 11:33.308
Bobby is not the father
of her baby, okay?

11:33.309 --> 11:34.578
I know that for a fact.

11:34.846 --> 11:38.257
My friend Faith? Her ex,
Greg. He's the father.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.848
Greg told Faith last week.

11:39.988 --> 11:43.813
Damn! This is gonna crush Bobby.
He about to take this test.

11:43.838 --> 11:46.361
I just don't want him to
give up before he even, no...

11:46.386 --> 11:48.740
Tray, no job is that important.

11:48.765 --> 11:50.058
You need to tell him the truth.

11:50.059 --> 11:52.348
I know. I know.

11:53.110 --> 11:54.237
I love the boy.

11:54.523 --> 11:56.598
But ever since he found
out he was gonna be a Dad,

11:56.840 --> 11:58.338
it changed him as a person.

11:58.608 --> 12:00.068
And it's all because of this baby.

12:00.069 --> 12:02.616
Tray. You got to tell him.

12:04.139 --> 12:05.908
After he takes the test. I promise.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.948
All done here, boss.

12:08.203 --> 12:09.723
I guess I'll see you Saturday morning.

12:09.794 --> 12:11.456
Yo, we're gonna move the truck down

12:11.481 --> 12:13.075
to the Brooklyn Bites festival.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.043
Try not to be late this time.

12:15.697 --> 12:17.546
All right. I'll see you
Saturday. Later, Shay.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.828
- All right. Later.
- All right.

12:19.559 --> 12:21.828
Actually, Tray, we should take the truck

12:22.063 --> 12:23.879
to Prospect Park on Saturday.

12:23.904 --> 12:25.561
See, there's an outdoor
concert going on.

12:25.586 --> 12:28.363
It's classical music, so
we could introduce the food

12:28.388 --> 12:30.917
to a whole different
demographic of people,

12:30.942 --> 12:32.615
- plus charge higher prices.
- Mm-hmm.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.038
But if we go to Brooklyn Bites,

12:34.148 --> 12:36.377
that's my people,
and I want to feed my people.

12:36.402 --> 12:39.019
- Okay, um... Tray?
- Mm-hmm.

12:39.044 --> 12:40.170
Now that we're partners,

12:40.195 --> 12:41.778
I think we should make
decisions together.

12:41.779 --> 12:43.456
Yeah, but since it's my food,

12:43.481 --> 12:45.518
I think we're gonna run
on down to Brooklyn Bites.

12:45.519 --> 12:47.018
Well, since it's my money...

12:48.637 --> 12:51.065
I'll see on over at Prospect Park.

12:59.381 --> 13:02.368
Everybody's here?
Good. All hands on deck.

13:02.510 --> 13:05.768
Bobby, I need you to go into the
park and pass out these flyers.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.728
Let people know where we are, okay?

13:07.753 --> 13:08.918
- Babe.
- Huh?

13:08.943 --> 13:11.808
I want you to wipe down the
whole truck on the outside.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.302
I need it shinin'!

13:13.620 --> 13:15.286
Green Eyes, I need you
to go to the corner,

13:15.310 --> 13:17.295
get the trash can, put it in
front of the truck so then,

13:17.319 --> 13:20.049
that way, our area stays
clean and looks more inviting.

13:21.036 --> 13:22.196
All right. Did I stutter?

13:22.873 --> 13:24.002
Get to it.

13:24.161 --> 13:27.440
- All right, all right.
- You could say "please".

13:27.465 --> 13:29.052
Baby, you'll be saying
"please" later on tonight

13:29.053 --> 13:30.982
when I get in that ass. Okay, look here.

13:30.983 --> 13:32.583
You sure give a lot of orders.

13:32.593 --> 13:34.252
It's not about being nice, Tray.

13:34.395 --> 13:36.392
When you're in charge, you
just got to get things done.

13:36.393 --> 13:38.062
Yeah, but I thought I was in charge.

13:38.063 --> 13:40.518
You are in charge. Now, get to cooking.

13:40.829 --> 13:42.258
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

13:43.597 --> 13:45.508
- This is gluten-free flour.
- Yeah?

13:45.533 --> 13:47.872
Well, gluten-free dishes are
gonna be a hit with this crowd.

13:47.873 --> 13:50.416
Yeah, but the theme of
this truck is "prison".

13:50.441 --> 13:53.148
And in prison, ain't no
such thing as gluten-free.

13:53.973 --> 13:55.632
Tray, you need to expand your vision.

13:55.657 --> 13:57.318
Your thinking is way too limited.

13:57.343 --> 14:00.212
There's a lot more things
we can be doing in Brooklyn

14:00.213 --> 14:01.752
besides feeding everybody.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.213
Yeah, but I want to feed Brooklyn.

14:03.223 --> 14:05.576
And real Brooklyn wants real flour.

14:06.953 --> 14:11.222
I already put on the flyers
that we have gluten-free options.

14:11.247 --> 14:12.816
Yeah, but I'm in charge!

14:13.397 --> 14:14.996
It's not about who's in charge.

14:15.156 --> 14:17.033
It's about who knows what
they're talking about.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.916
And that's me!

14:21.435 --> 14:23.618
Yeah, you look crazy in that whiteface,

14:23.643 --> 14:25.172
trying to impress my people.

14:25.173 --> 14:26.903
- Oh, you think this is funny?
- Yes.

14:26.913 --> 14:28.712
- You think it's funny?
- Ha, ha, ha!

14:28.713 --> 14:30.442
- "Ha, ha, ha".
- Look at you.

14:30.443 --> 14:31.999
Well, how do you feel, huh?

14:34.308 --> 14:37.182
Look at you. Lookin'
like a black geisha.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.629
Don't you, Tray.
Don't... Don't you do it.

14:39.654 --> 14:41.593
- Don't you do it, Tray.
- Nah, you asked for it.

14:41.618 --> 14:43.817
No, don't you... Don't you... Tray!

14:44.334 --> 14:46.638
Don't do it! Tray! Stop it!

14:46.663 --> 14:48.024
You play too much!

14:55.689 --> 14:58.459
Hi. Hey... Hey, there. Uh...

15:00.943 --> 15:02.673
How can we help you?

15:04.143 --> 15:06.511
I think we pretty much threw
away all the profits for today.

15:06.536 --> 15:07.812
That's what I'm talking about, man.

15:07.813 --> 15:09.082
Like, pre-exterminator Bobby?

15:09.520 --> 15:11.080
Oh, I'd have loved to see a food fight.

15:11.145 --> 15:12.447
Oh, yeah. I'd loved that.
You know what I'm sayin'?

15:12.471 --> 15:14.372
But right now, I just can't
help but think of how that's...

15:14.396 --> 15:15.795
that's hurting the brand, right?

15:15.820 --> 15:17.922
I got to tell you, Bobby.
I'm really impressed

15:17.947 --> 15:19.767
with how you're sticking
to this new path,

15:19.792 --> 15:20.978
- you know?
- Thank you. Thank you.

15:21.002 --> 15:23.448
Especially after Lisa lied to
you about it being your baby.

15:23.876 --> 15:25.860
And you stayed strong
through the whole thing.

15:26.654 --> 15:27.955
That's... That's something.
You should be proud.

15:27.979 --> 15:29.572
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. What you...

15:29.573 --> 15:32.829
What you talking about, she...
she lied... lied about the baby?

15:32.854 --> 15:33.942
What are you doing?

15:34.608 --> 15:36.640
Oh, shit. No, uh...

15:37.815 --> 15:38.946
Bobby, I'm sorry.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.418
I assumed that, uh...

15:41.125 --> 15:43.028
Shannon told me. I assumed you knew.

15:43.053 --> 15:45.283
And that... I'm sorry.

15:45.442 --> 15:47.864
Oh, nah, nah.

15:47.889 --> 15:49.371
Nah, nah, it's cool.

15:50.263 --> 15:52.362
It's cool. You know what I'm sayin'?

15:52.928 --> 15:54.192
I dodged a bullet.

15:54.193 --> 15:55.932
- Yeah.
- Right? Right?

15:55.933 --> 15:57.962
I'm sorry. I really am.

15:58.648 --> 16:00.317
I mean, that's... that's great news.

16:00.445 --> 16:03.526
Well... I'm sure it's not.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.098
It's good news!

16:07.123 --> 16:09.492
I... I feel bad, Bobby.

16:11.543 --> 16:13.743
Can you leave that trash,
though? I'll take care of it.

16:15.471 --> 16:16.922
H... I'll get that!

16:18.034 --> 16:20.075
I'll... Don't even worry
about it! I'll get it!

16:21.543 --> 16:24.115
- Shay!
- Tray.

16:24.393 --> 16:25.526
Yo, I came over here to let you know

16:25.550 --> 16:27.256
how pissed off I was yesterday.

16:27.281 --> 16:28.962
I've decided to find a new investor

16:28.963 --> 16:30.532
to buy you and Josh out!

16:30.833 --> 16:32.772
Just so I don't have to
deal with this no more!

16:34.373 --> 16:36.156
- Thank you.
- Tray, I don't want that.

16:36.346 --> 16:37.702
Good, 'cause I don't even know

16:37.703 --> 16:39.703
where I was gonna find
somebody to buy y'all out.

16:39.713 --> 16:41.642
I don't even know nobody
with that kind of money.

16:41.752 --> 16:43.965
- That's a damn shame.
- Mm. Yo, you know what?

16:43.990 --> 16:46.917
The last time I saw you this mad
was just before I got locked up.

16:46.942 --> 16:50.182
Remember? And I bought them tickets
to the Mary J. Blige concert.

16:50.183 --> 16:51.922
Yeah, that was a big fight.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.922
I told me I should know
you well enough to know

16:53.923 --> 16:55.922
that you don't even
like concerts, remember?

16:55.923 --> 16:57.322
And then the real reason came out...

16:57.323 --> 16:59.541
is 'cause LaTanya Leggett
was gonna be there.

16:59.827 --> 17:01.130
Yeah, that bitch was set trippin',

17:01.154 --> 17:03.414
talkin' about she was gonna
whup my ass on eyesight.

17:03.514 --> 17:04.542
I love me some Mary,

17:04.568 --> 17:06.299
but not enough to be
getting no ass-whuppin'.

17:06.323 --> 17:09.252
- So what you scared of now?
- Psh. What? Nothing.

17:09.816 --> 17:12.541
Come on, Shay. Something's scaring you.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.488
Boy, please. I ain't scared of nothing

17:14.512 --> 17:17.172
except for something
happening to my kids and Josh.

17:17.459 --> 17:19.719
Oh, and horses... anything that big

17:19.752 --> 17:22.258
that'll let you nail shoes
into the bottom of their feet

17:22.282 --> 17:26.298
and ride them is either
stupid or trying to set you up.

17:26.323 --> 17:27.722
I promise you.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.345
I ain't never scared.

17:29.370 --> 17:33.353
I am so, so scared!

17:34.321 --> 17:37.606
I just lost my job, and I'm
trying to start my own business.

17:37.631 --> 17:38.902
Now, what was I thinking?!

17:38.903 --> 17:40.386
You're thinking smart.

17:40.411 --> 17:42.502
You're taking your future
into your own hands.

17:42.503 --> 17:45.302
But what if I fail? What
if I can't make payroll?

17:45.522 --> 17:47.442
Or I hire the wrong marketing team?

17:47.443 --> 17:49.573
Ohh, where the kids gonna live?!

17:49.583 --> 17:50.682
Okay, okay, okay.

17:50.707 --> 17:55.488
So, in this extreme scenario,
I guess Josh is dead?

17:55.513 --> 17:57.313
Girl, yeah. He gets shot by the police

17:57.323 --> 17:59.452
for robbing a liquor store
'cause he's trying to feed us

17:59.453 --> 18:02.647
- and everything!
- Oh, my God. Listen, okay?

18:02.672 --> 18:07.092
Everything worth doing comes with risks.

18:07.456 --> 18:09.356
Do you think I like being single again?

18:09.603 --> 18:11.740
They say women our age
have a better chance

18:11.765 --> 18:13.063
of getting struck by lightning

18:13.073 --> 18:15.172
than finding a meaningful relationship.

18:16.001 --> 18:17.930
Girl, that shit scared me so much,

18:17.955 --> 18:20.024
I thought about taking
Greg's begging ass back.

18:20.049 --> 18:22.124
- Mnh!
- But then it hit me.

18:22.543 --> 18:25.282
I know my worth. Do you know your worth?

18:25.587 --> 18:27.656
Yeah. I am... I am smart.

18:27.681 --> 18:29.080
- Yes, you are.
- I'm talented.

18:29.105 --> 18:30.434
- I'm kind.
- Yes, you are!

18:30.459 --> 18:32.351
- I'm a problem-solver.
- Come on!

18:32.376 --> 18:33.751
Yeah, and I'm talented.

18:33.776 --> 18:35.569
- Yes, you are.
- Am I really talented?

18:35.594 --> 18:37.463
Yes, you're talented!

18:37.879 --> 18:41.162
You know, I've been thinking
about expanding my business,

18:41.163 --> 18:43.155
you know, maybe adding on a partner.

18:43.362 --> 18:45.857
It'd be a lot less scary
if I did it with a friend.

18:45.882 --> 18:47.078
- Girl.
- Girl.

18:47.103 --> 18:48.632
- Girl!
- You think?

18:48.830 --> 18:50.638
Let me get my portfolio
so I can show you

18:50.663 --> 18:52.010
- some of my sketches.
- Mm-hmm.

18:52.035 --> 18:54.091
And then we can argue about
where our office is gonna be.

18:54.115 --> 18:55.212
Ooh. Manhattan.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.883
Oh, no, we definitely gonna be arguing.

18:57.908 --> 18:59.112
- Why?!
- Mm-hmm.

Yo, Bob, I owe you an apology, kid.

19:29.801 --> 19:32.635
I should've told you about
this chick Lisa sooner.

19:32.746 --> 19:34.920
You know, I didn't have the right
to withhold information on you.

19:34.944 --> 19:36.013
I'm just saying I'm sorry.

19:36.023 --> 19:37.585
Look, it's cool. It's cool, man.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.434
I know you just was
lookin' out, all right?

19:39.459 --> 19:40.968
Matter of fact, you probably was right.

19:40.992 --> 19:42.253
You know what I'm talkin' about?

Yeah. So what you gonna do now?

19:44.093 --> 19:45.872
I mean, yo, buster, you
could always come work

19:45.896 --> 19:47.223

19:47.248 --> 19:49.594
You might have to fight
Green Eyes, but it's all good.

19:49.619 --> 19:51.632
You know, I'm gonna do that, man.

19:52.039 --> 19:55.426
But I think I'm gonna still
give this bug stuff a try.

19:55.451 --> 19:56.507
You know what I'm
sayin'? I'm good at it.

19:56.531 --> 19:58.502
Yes, man. I'm happy for you, cuz.

19:58.737 --> 20:01.045
And, by the way, man, can
you please get your hands

20:01.070 --> 20:02.648
on some of that industrial bug spray?

20:02.673 --> 20:04.966
'Cause I'm scared to death
to go up in Mullins', man.

20:04.991 --> 20:06.112
You got me thinkin', B.

20:06.113 --> 20:07.852

Yo! Lisa! Yo, come on down, man.

20:10.594 --> 20:12.075
I've got some stuff for you, baby.

20:13.354 --> 20:14.883
I got to tell you, cuz, man.

20:14.908 --> 20:16.685
For you to be able to forgive somebody

20:16.710 --> 20:18.392
- after something like this happens?
- Yeah.

20:18.393 --> 20:20.522
And then let Lisa keep the baby stuff?

20:20.547 --> 20:21.932
- Man, that's big.
- Yeah.

20:21.933 --> 20:23.032
I'm proud of you.

20:24.133 --> 20:25.232
Don't be.

20:47.093 --> 20:52.223

arsonist motherfucker!
