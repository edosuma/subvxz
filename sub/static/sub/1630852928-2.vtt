[somber instrumental music playing]

00:10.593 --> 00:12.053
[indistinct chatter]

00:15.890 --> 00:18.560
[inhales deeply and exhales]

00:20.895 --> 00:22.522
[Leif] Do you feel justice?

00:25.608 --> 00:27.902
Yes. I do.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.157
I feel cleansed.

00:33.908 --> 00:34.868
Good.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.789
Because now they intend to kill us.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.375
I don't believe that.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.587
-Father said--
-Father was wrong.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.882
He's a stranger to this world, Freydis.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.426
He doesn't know
much has changed since he left.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.094
Then I believe in Jarl Haakon.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.682
She will not allow it. She's strong.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.310
She is also in a difficult position.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.979
If she releases us, she will start a war.

01:04.564 --> 01:08.276
Christians will burn down Kattegat
and many of her people will die.

01:09.944 --> 01:12.280
It's in her best interest
to have us killed.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.784
[sobs softly]

01:17.494 --> 01:18.828
But regardless…

01:21.081 --> 01:22.248
I am proud of you.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.798
Thank you.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.550
[indistinct chatter]

01:37.639 --> 01:39.265
-[Olaf] Silence!
-[chatter stops]

01:41.017 --> 01:45.688
Freydis Eriksdotter, you are accused
of murdering a man you claim attacked you.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.440
Have you a way to prove this?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.108
Did I put the scar on my back?

01:49.192 --> 01:51.694
Any one of your lovers
could have done that to you!

01:51.778 --> 01:53.113
The Gods know the truth.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.239
False Gods!

01:54.322 --> 01:55.990
-[clamoring]
-[staff thuds]

01:56.074 --> 01:59.244
-[Gorm] There's only one false God!
-[Haakon] Silence!

01:59.327 --> 02:00.370
Your Christian God.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.830
-Silence!
-[clamoring stops]

02:02.455 --> 02:03.456
Hmm.

02:05.458 --> 02:09.963
In the old ways, you would be
within your rights to take revenge.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.882
But we live in different times.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.469
There are those gathered among us

02:16.553 --> 02:19.973
who feel that your claims
require further proof.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.433
Can you provide it?

02:23.184 --> 02:24.394
A trial by combat.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.730
If I am lying,
the Gods will not protect me.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.358
Combat? With me?

02:30.441 --> 02:32.443
[all laughing]

02:33.528 --> 02:36.197
You are her accuser. Are you afraid?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.116
[laughter continues]

02:42.745 --> 02:43.913
King Canute.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.500
This woman's actions have robbed you
of a valuable part of your arsenal.

02:47.584 --> 02:52.213
Not having Gunnar
puts the lives of everyone in this room,

02:52.297 --> 02:54.966
Christian and Pagan, at risk.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.301
[crowd murmuring]

02:56.384 --> 03:01.514
Therefore, I implore you
and the noble ruler of Kattegat

03:02.599 --> 03:04.267
to acknowledge that debt

03:05.018 --> 03:07.353
and make her pay for it with her life.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.147
[crowd clamoring]

03:09.230 --> 03:10.648
[intense music playing]

03:15.862 --> 03:18.114
[Harald] Jarl Haakon, may I speak?

03:18.197 --> 03:19.449
[clamoring stops]

03:21.618 --> 03:24.913
Jarl Olaf makes an excellent argument.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.166
Gunnar was
an important part of our strategy,

03:28.249 --> 03:30.126
and his loss will indeed cause hardship.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.796
But my brother
may have also offered a better solution.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.635
Since this woman
cost you a vital element to our mission,

03:39.385 --> 03:42.055
should she not be forced
to render something of equal

03:42.138 --> 03:44.140
if not greater value to our endeavor?

03:45.266 --> 03:46.476
Such as?

03:49.145 --> 03:52.065
Her brother, Leif Eriksson.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.569
Son of the Great Berserker, Erik The Red.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.570
[crowd murmuring]

03:57.654 --> 04:02.116
One of, if not the best
ship captain in this room.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.828
He piloted his ship
across open ocean from Greenland

04:05.912 --> 04:08.581
through a storm
that killed scores of others.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.044
I can personally attest
to his fighting skills.

04:13.127 --> 04:16.047
But should we doubt his motivation,

04:16.130 --> 04:19.968
he will be fighting
for the life… of his sister.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.596
[indistinct chatter]

04:33.481 --> 04:35.066
-[staff thuds]
-[chatter stops]

04:35.775 --> 04:39.904
Leif Eriksson, I ransom
your sister to King Canute.

04:40.822 --> 04:44.993
To repay her debt,
you must pledge service to his cause.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.996
Do you accept these terms?

04:51.916 --> 04:52.750
I do.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.129
Then… it is done.

05:01.592 --> 05:02.593
[man] Move!

05:02.677 --> 05:03.803
[indistinct chatter]

05:12.437 --> 05:14.439
[opening theme music playing]

05:26.409 --> 05:27.535
[counsellor] The King.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.454
[exhales]

05:30.955 --> 05:33.624
One year ago, on my orders,

05:34.834 --> 05:37.003
a decree was sent out

05:37.086 --> 05:41.049
that all Danes living
on this island be destroyed

05:42.341 --> 05:45.094
in a most just extermination.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.931
On that fated day,

05:49.891 --> 05:53.686
a group of Norse
entered this sanctuary of God

05:54.645 --> 05:58.441
and purposefully set fire to it,
destroying it.

05:59.525 --> 06:05.823
And ultimately themselves
in an act of futile retribution.

06:06.741 --> 06:12.497
Today, we witness
the resurrection of this house of worship.

06:12.580 --> 06:17.960
Restored to its original glory
by me, Æthelred.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.465
And by God's blessing.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.842
[solemn instrumental music playing]

06:29.263 --> 06:30.890
[woman] Peace be with you, sire.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.059
[bell tolling]

06:34.435 --> 06:35.645
[indistinct chatter]

06:38.981 --> 06:40.108
[commander] Formation!

06:42.318 --> 06:43.486
Forward!

06:46.322 --> 06:47.281
[neighing]

06:51.994 --> 06:53.079
Align!

06:53.162 --> 06:54.038
[coughing]

07:00.086 --> 07:01.838
You know something

07:03.172 --> 07:04.924
which you are not sharing with me.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.305
Our spies in the north say
the Vikings are preparing for an invasion.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.391
Damn the nobles.

07:13.474 --> 07:16.769
They swore the Norse were
too busy fighting among themselves

07:16.853 --> 07:19.439
to bother with us. And I believed them.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.774
You did what needed to be done
to keep them in line.

07:21.858 --> 07:25.695
Yes, but it's not their heads
the Vikings will want on a pike.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.281
It's mine. [grunts]

07:30.575 --> 07:31.409
[Æthelred sighs]

07:32.577 --> 07:33.911
She was right.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.582
She knew they would come.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.337
[indistinct chatter]

07:46.257 --> 07:47.800
It was my father's ship.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.095
It's fast and tough.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.307
And now it's yours.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.357
[man 1] Ready to go to England.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.359
Toss me that rope then, now.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.447
It's a good boat.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.532
I'm glad you find it so,

08:13.284 --> 08:15.369
but that is the ship I covet.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.874
King Harald of Norway. Mm?

08:21.584 --> 08:22.585
Someday.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.629
[gripping instrumental music playing]

08:28.299 --> 08:29.717
[man 2] Hail Canute!

08:33.262 --> 08:34.889
Ragnor, raise the banner.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.399
[people cheering]

08:46.859 --> 08:48.194
[horn blows]

09:02.291 --> 09:03.709
[horn blows in distance]

09:04.293 --> 09:07.088
If you're expecting me to thank you,
you will be disappointed.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.635
You're welcome, anyway.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.972
I told you what I came for
and you took advantage of me.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.600
Who took advantage
of whom is up for debate.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.981
-You could have helped me.
-I could have had you killed.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.357
And you did neither.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.529
What kind of man does that?

09:34.282 --> 09:35.866
A man who is amazed by you.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.000
So why have you come?

09:47.503 --> 09:50.047
We may be gone
from Kattegat five months or more.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.050
You have people to say goodbye to.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.136
[uplifting instrumental music playing]

10:00.516 --> 10:01.517
[Freydis chuckles]

10:02.226 --> 10:03.102
[Freydis sighs]

10:08.691 --> 10:11.235
I will make sacrifices to Odin
for your safe return.

10:11.319 --> 10:15.156
I'll be fine.
You just take care of yourself, hmm?

10:28.252 --> 10:29.378
[Freydis] Skarde.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.720
I'll see you soon.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.014
Yeah!

10:40.097 --> 10:41.265
[both laughing]

10:42.725 --> 10:44.560
-Go get them, Ulf.
-[Ulf] Yes.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.730
[Freydis] And Liv.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.735
You take care of him.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.403
[Liv] I will.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.662
Protect each other.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.872
You do the same.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.299
[exhales]

11:21.806 --> 11:23.140
Prince of Norway!

11:34.485 --> 11:35.903
Five months is a long time.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.600
So, you're Greenlanders?

12:07.893 --> 12:11.188
-Yeah.
-Is it really as green as it sounds?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.148
[all chuckle]

12:12.231 --> 12:16.360
Well, absolutely.
At least two days a year.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.237
[laughter]

12:20.698 --> 12:23.117
I'm Johan. This is Tomas.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.369
Skarde.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.753
-Jarl Gorm.
-Harald.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.380
Arne.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.758
[Gorm] So, this is the young captain
you spoke of?

12:39.842 --> 12:40.801
Leif Eriksson.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.636
I know your father.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.973
He is a brave seaman
and a strong believer.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.224
Is he still that way?

12:47.308 --> 12:49.852
If you know my father,
then you know that nothing changes.

12:49.935 --> 12:50.936
Good.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.771
[man] And the Lord grant us fairway.

12:53.439 --> 12:57.818
Prince Harald, I agreed to fight
with Christians, not row with them.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.492
Suit yourself, Jarl Gorm.

13:05.201 --> 13:09.079
But we're leaving
and it's a long swim to England.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.166
[Leif] Skarde.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.129
Skarde, put this in the back.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.012
Listen up!

13:25.804 --> 13:27.806
All knives and axes in the barrel.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.100
No one rows with a weapon on them.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.228
I don't give up my knife for anybody.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.563
There's only one reason
to row with a weapon

13:35.189 --> 13:37.525
and that is
to kill someone else on this boat.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.069
Your enemy is not here.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.487
What if he is?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.199
Then I deal with it.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.868
I have no enemies here.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.954
[intense music playing]

14:00.714 --> 14:01.840
[man] Put the axe in.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.639
No, I don't like it. Put it in the barrel.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.433
Yeah, mine as well.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.437
Put it in and get back to your work.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.483
On your side.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.123
[weapons clatter]

14:47.094 --> 14:48.637
[horn blows]

14:48.721 --> 14:50.389
[people cheering]

14:50.472 --> 14:52.766
[captivating instrumental music playing]

14:57.396 --> 14:58.939
[horn blows]

15:15.164 --> 15:16.999
-Row!
-[grunting]

15:17.875 --> 15:20.002
[all] Yeah!

15:20.920 --> 15:22.963
Yeah!

15:23.047 --> 15:24.673
Yeah!

15:31.055 --> 15:33.015
[stately instrumental music playing]

15:35.684 --> 15:37.353
[man] Make way for the Queen!

15:39.563 --> 15:40.606
Make way there.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.165
[doctor] He is not well, Your Highness.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.085
His cough has deepened
with his worry over the coming invasion.

16:01.877 --> 16:05.339
Perhaps you could
lessen his fears over the Northmen.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.424
Thank you.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.935
[boy praying in Latin]

16:19.061 --> 16:20.229
[in English] Leave.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.071
[counsellor] Highness.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.373
-[boy] Amen.
-[Æthelred breathes heavily]

16:39.456 --> 16:40.416
Get up, Edmund.

16:46.714 --> 16:47.589
Emma.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.511
They are coming.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.014
I've heard.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.266
With Godwin's help,

16:58.600 --> 16:59.435
I…

17:01.311 --> 17:05.357
I have dictated terms
for you to present to them.

17:06.775 --> 17:10.154
They always listen to gold.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.450
I have no intention
of bargaining with them.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.330
What do you intend to do?

17:21.957 --> 17:22.791
Fight.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.420
I intend to send Edmund to Mercia.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.756
On your orders he will summon

17:28.839 --> 17:31.050
Eadric Streona
to bring his army to London.

17:31.133 --> 17:36.096
He also will try
and take the throne from Edmund.

17:36.180 --> 17:40.225
He will try, but not until
after the Vikings have been defeated.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.895
And what about your brother in Normandy?

17:44.313 --> 17:46.273
Will he offer support?

17:46.356 --> 17:48.734
He will not help us
until we help ourselves.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.572
I have left you a nightmare.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.492
You married a Norman.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.036
We create nightmares.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.538
[indistinct shouting]

18:12.466 --> 18:15.427
So, is this your first Viking raid?

18:16.512 --> 18:17.596
Are you nervous?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.390
My father was a raider.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.310
He told me he was a Berserker.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.816
That means he was
a mighty warrior and killed many men.

18:29.691 --> 18:30.776
Like Harald.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.487
Why did he go to Greenland?

18:33.570 --> 18:36.573
Because he killed men
even when he wasn't raiding.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.118
Have you ever killed a man before?

18:40.160 --> 18:42.746
No. I've never had reason to.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.878
The first time is sometimes difficult.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.631
It's no different
than killing any other living thing.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.509
A man is different. He fights back.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.636
So does a polar bear.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.263
[chuckles softly]

19:07.771 --> 19:09.857
[gripping instrumental music playing]

19:10.524 --> 19:11.483
[man] Milord.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.776
[indistinct chatter]

19:13.861 --> 19:14.862
[dogs barking]

19:29.543 --> 19:30.752
[Godwin] Your Highness.

19:32.379 --> 19:35.966
I had no idea you were moving
the military operations into the old city?

19:36.633 --> 19:39.928
There's no better fortress for London
than the site the Romans chose.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.973
I'm surprised
that it sat deserted for years.

19:43.765 --> 19:46.935
That is because it is thought
to be inhabited by their ghosts.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.397
I don't believe
ghosts can hurt me, Godwin.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.817
But I do believe that Vikings can.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.777
[bell tolling in distance]

19:57.070 --> 19:59.239
But concentrating our forces in the South,

19:59.323 --> 20:02.784
where the river's tides and the marshes
provide a natural protection.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.329
Are you sure this is a sound idea?

20:05.913 --> 20:06.788
I am.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.501
Because I'm expecting
the Norse to behave exactly like you.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.753
[Godwin] Which is how?

20:13.629 --> 20:14.880
To underestimate me.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.052
Forgive me, Your Highness,
you summoned me for a reason.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.220
How may I be of service?

20:21.803 --> 20:25.307
I am sending Edmund to Mercia
to enlist Eadric Streona's aid.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.227
Streona will ask much for that favor.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.312
Which is why
you are to accompany the prince

20:30.395 --> 20:32.022
and ensure that doesn't happen.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.275
Your Highness, may I speak freely?

20:36.193 --> 20:39.529
It is no secret that you have never liked,
much less trusted me before.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.199
There are many others you could send.

20:42.282 --> 20:45.160
-So why trust you with the king-to-be?
-Yes.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.454
[Emma] Necessity creates unusual allies.

20:47.996 --> 20:52.167
If we do not secure Mercia's help
against the Vikings, England is lost.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.088
If England is lost, so are we.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.092
I will not fail you.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.802
[Emma] Not me.

21:02.552 --> 21:03.387
Us.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.481
It is crucial that Eadric Streona
bring his army to London

21:14.564 --> 21:16.191
and follow our instructions.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.944
-What if he sets conditions for this aid?
-Refuse.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.780
Do not allow yourself
to be drawn into a negotiation.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.115
But what if he insists?

21:23.198 --> 21:25.909
You're not making
a plea for help, Your Highness.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.537
You're relaying an order
from your father, the King.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.580
Listen to Godwin.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.083
[intense music playing]

21:38.672 --> 21:40.048
[Edmund grunts]

21:46.305 --> 21:48.515
Father won't be alive
when I return, will he?

21:48.598 --> 21:49.725
No.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.644
When you return, you will be king.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.899
But unless you are successful,
you will not have a long rule.

22:01.862 --> 22:02.904
Open the gates.

22:02.988 --> 22:03.905
[gates open]

22:05.282 --> 22:06.575
[horse huffing]

22:13.040 --> 22:14.708
[music intensifies]

22:17.627 --> 22:19.046
[indistinct chatter]

22:20.255 --> 22:22.758
[Canute] Show me what you mean, Jarl Olaf.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.719
[Olaf] Since the Romans
first built the city,

22:25.802 --> 22:29.056
the bridge has been of vital importance.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.640
It connects everything

22:30.724 --> 22:34.478
and provides a way to escape
should pressure be brought from the north.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.605
Then we should bring it down?

22:36.688 --> 22:37.773
Not possible.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.817
When I was King Æthelred's advisor,
I made sure of that.

22:41.526 --> 22:45.906
No, if we are to crush London,
we do what Vikings have never done.

22:45.989 --> 22:49.076
We attack from the south.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.621
There's a reason
it's never been done, brother.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.706
The south is nothing but marsh.

22:54.790 --> 22:58.418
-Which is why Æthelred won't expect it.
-How do you know that?

23:00.587 --> 23:03.507
Because I'm the one
who convinced him it was impossible.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.885
-[horn blowing]
-[man] Secure!

23:08.595 --> 23:09.930
[thunder rumbling]

23:10.680 --> 23:12.140
[indistinct chatter]

23:21.608 --> 23:22.943
[thunderclap]

23:24.194 --> 23:27.197
-Lower the sail.
-Lower the sail!

23:31.368 --> 23:32.202
[Arne laughs]

23:33.120 --> 23:37.999
Watch out, Christian.
Maybe you should pray to be more careful.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.169
-You tripped him on purpose.
-I did not.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.546
I saw you.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.549
Are you calling me a liar? Huh?

23:46.800 --> 23:49.261
Come here and tell me that. Huh?

23:49.344 --> 23:52.180
Sit down and row.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.813
Do you have a problem with my order?

23:59.896 --> 24:01.273
[chuckles] I'm fine.

24:04.442 --> 24:08.113
I thought you were a follower
of the old Gods, like your father.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.364
I am.

24:09.447 --> 24:12.909
Then why take the word
of a Christian over my own son?

24:12.993 --> 24:15.120
Because your son is a liar, Jarl Gorm.

24:16.955 --> 24:20.000
You should hold on.
It's about to get rough.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.003
Row into it!

24:23.086 --> 24:24.379
[indistinct chatter]

24:24.462 --> 24:26.298
[cheerful folk music playing]

24:29.009 --> 24:30.427
[woman] Hello, Jarl Haakon.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.099
You are looking
to burn a sacrifice for a loved one?

24:36.183 --> 24:37.309
My brother.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.811
He's on one of the ships.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.689
[woman] This is a special one.

24:43.773 --> 24:46.902
It is made from the branch
of a sacred tree in Uppsala.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.823
Yggdrasil?

24:51.907 --> 24:54.159
The World Tree is not in Uppsala.

24:55.076 --> 24:58.663
This is probably taken
from the tree outside Odin's temple.

24:58.747 --> 25:01.499
It is green summer and winter.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.752
And blessed by the priests there.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.344
But I have no money.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.847
I will trade you for your bracelet.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.559
What about my necklace?

25:21.269 --> 25:22.270
Yeah.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.116
[Freydis] Why do you sell those?

25:36.701 --> 25:39.454
I sell whatever soothes the soul.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.790
Are you a Christian?

25:41.873 --> 25:44.000
[woman] I was born in the old ways.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.920
But I am whatever I have to be today.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.381
Thank you.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.513
Viking people
have travelled more than most.

25:57.389 --> 26:01.810
We raided, yes, but we traded too.

26:02.727 --> 26:06.564
Kattegat is the beneficiary of that trade.

26:07.607 --> 26:12.487
You will experience different people
and beliefs here like nowhere else.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.533
And you are not
threatened by those beliefs?

26:18.493 --> 26:19.452
Look at me.

26:20.245 --> 26:24.207
My grandmother came
from a great African family.

26:24.958 --> 26:29.296
My grandfather fell in love with her
in Alexandria and brought her here.

26:29.879 --> 26:32.382
Their child, my father,

26:33.174 --> 26:35.385
became an even greater warrior,

26:36.678 --> 26:40.223
and now I am the ruler of Kattegat.

26:41.474 --> 26:44.936
All things are possible
if our minds are open.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.567
[mystical music playing]

26:51.568 --> 26:53.320
[Freydis praying in Old Norse]

27:11.546 --> 27:14.591
[Haakon in English] Your faith
is very strong, Freydis.

27:17.177 --> 27:22.390
I am sure Ægir and Ran
will watch over your brother and friends.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.184
I'm sure they will.

27:25.643 --> 27:28.980
There are a few today
as pure in their beliefs as you.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.901
It is all I know.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.738
My husband was trading in Trömsa

27:37.989 --> 27:40.450
when his ship was stopped by Christians.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.828
My husband was very devout, like you.

27:44.746 --> 27:48.583
When they found that he and his men
were believers of the old ways,

27:49.417 --> 27:51.628
he was ordered to convert.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.380
He refused.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.508
The Christians decided
to make him an example

27:56.591 --> 27:58.343
and torture him in front of his men,

27:58.927 --> 28:04.349
in hopes that his suffering would
encourage them to change their beliefs.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.394
[breathes deeply]

28:08.228 --> 28:10.146
It had the opposite effect.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.484
One by one,

28:16.444 --> 28:17.862
they killed them all.

28:28.998 --> 28:32.001
I am sorry my offering
has brought back such memories.

28:34.796 --> 28:38.758
Change is happening, and we must be ready.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.033
[Godwin] Your Highness?

29:07.203 --> 29:08.163
Are you all right?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.459
I wasn't supposed to be here.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.462
-Sire?
-[Edmund] My brothers were.

29:16.337 --> 29:19.591
I didn't think that they would both die
and it would happen this way.

29:24.345 --> 29:25.972
I'm not king material.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.643
-How do you know?
-What?

29:31.644 --> 29:34.689
How do you know you're not the king
England needs at this moment?

29:35.982 --> 29:38.151
The fact that I voiced my doubts

29:38.234 --> 29:40.528
should be evidence enough
of my inadequacy.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.282
[gulps]

29:44.365 --> 29:46.159
It's been my experience

29:46.242 --> 29:49.996
that those who never
acknowledge their doubts are charlatans.

29:51.748 --> 29:55.418
I believe that a search of one's soul
is a sign of strength, not weakness.

29:55.502 --> 29:58.546
Facing doubts or fears
is the first step in courage.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.966
What's your greatest fear? [sniffs]

30:03.009 --> 30:03.843
Failure.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.722
It is paralyzing.

30:08.515 --> 30:10.308
Do you trust your instincts?

30:11.768 --> 30:12.727
I think so.

30:13.353 --> 30:17.732
If so, there will come a day when
your fear of failure will be overwhelmed

30:18.483 --> 30:20.235
by an instinct to act.

30:21.569 --> 30:22.612
To survive.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.949
If you listen to it, you will succeed.

30:31.412 --> 30:32.747
Good night, Your Highness.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.798
[gripping instrumental music playing]

30:41.881 --> 30:43.675
[indistinct shouting]

30:47.679 --> 30:49.556
See you in England, friends.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.476
So, no sign of your Greenlander?

30:54.894 --> 31:00.358
Maybe you should make an offering to Ægir
for your boat's safe return. [chuckles]

31:00.441 --> 31:03.152
Do you ever get tired
of saying stupid things?

31:03.945 --> 31:08.074
Like letting my brother know
when he makes a mistake? No. Never.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.993
[laughs boisterously]

31:13.913 --> 31:15.665
-[Olaf grunts]
-[boat creaking]

31:25.258 --> 31:28.344
What do you see in this Greenlander
that makes you trust him?

31:28.428 --> 31:31.306
I don't know. Maybe his courage.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.686
Courage is not rare here.

31:38.104 --> 31:38.980
His is.

31:40.523 --> 31:43.526
It doesn't come from speeches
or pounding of shields.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.572
It comes from belief
in his own ability and nothing else.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.701
In my experience, that is rare.

31:56.497 --> 31:57.624
[horses huffing]

32:06.382 --> 32:07.342
[Streona] Ironside,

32:08.760 --> 32:11.179
Boneless, Bloodaxe,

32:12.764 --> 32:14.057
such great names.

32:14.891 --> 32:15.850
[Streona chuckles]

32:16.643 --> 32:19.187
You know what they all
have in common, Your Highness?

32:20.647 --> 32:21.522
They're dead.

32:26.903 --> 32:30.782
Tell your father I can give him
5,000 men and 1,000 horses,

32:30.865 --> 32:33.534
but it would be a mistake
to send them to London.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.494
Why so?

32:35.078 --> 32:37.372
Mercians have been
fighting the Vikings for 200 years

32:37.455 --> 32:38.998
and we've learned a great many things.

32:39.082 --> 32:42.335
I have no doubt
that London is Canute's target,

32:42.418 --> 32:46.756
but he'll attack the city from the north,
which means he'll march through Mercia.

32:46.839 --> 32:50.385
To defeat him in London,
you must first stop him here.

32:52.887 --> 32:54.764
That is not what the Queen Emma believes.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.101
She believes
the Vikings will attack elsewhere.

32:59.018 --> 32:59.978
Queen Emma?

33:02.689 --> 33:04.399
Is your father not well?

33:05.191 --> 33:09.320
The King is in excellent health,
but his wife, as you know, is a Norman.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.365
What better person to plan
the defense of a Viking attack

33:12.448 --> 33:14.867
than a descendant of Rollo himself.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.204
Godwin.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.666
I knew a noble named Godwin from Sussex.

33:23.668 --> 33:24.585
My father.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.214
If I'm not mistaken,
it didn't end well for him, did it?

33:28.297 --> 33:32.176
You're not talking to my father,
you're talking to me.

33:39.392 --> 33:43.396
-The King knows exactly what he's doing.
-[Streona] You think so?

33:44.063 --> 33:46.774
[clicks tongue] It doesn't
sound like that to me.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.402
It sounds like he has no plan

33:49.485 --> 33:52.739
and has placed England's future
in the hands of a foreign queen,

33:52.822 --> 33:58.202
a boy prince, and an advisor
whose father destroyed his family name.

33:59.454 --> 34:00.788
[Edmund] Then do nothing.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.373
[intense music playing]

34:03.458 --> 34:07.545
Do nothing, Eadric Streona,
if that is your decision.

34:08.963 --> 34:13.926
But be willing to stand by it
because, one day, I will be king,

34:15.511 --> 34:18.431
and I can promise
that I will remember both your doubt

34:18.514 --> 34:21.559
and your decision to refuse an order.

34:27.023 --> 34:29.567
Who said that I would not obey
a summons from the King?

34:31.152 --> 34:34.155
Tell your father and your stepmother,

34:36.282 --> 34:39.660
that Mercia will be there, as ordered.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.552
[music intensifies]

35:02.600 --> 35:04.811
[people chanting in Latin]

35:04.894 --> 35:06.562
[wind howling]

35:11.234 --> 35:12.985
[chanting continues]

35:19.742 --> 35:21.828
[ominous music playing]

35:42.682 --> 35:44.267
[in English] We're lost, aren't we?

35:45.601 --> 35:48.479
You've never been to England,
and you've lost us.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.898
-We're not lost.
-[Gorm] Liar!

35:50.982 --> 35:56.112
This is your fault and the fault of
all the Christians and their false God.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.197
The Gods are laughing at us right now.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.615
Shut up, heathen.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.953
-What did you say to me?
-I said, shut up.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.914
You sound like a frightened child.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.960
-[Leif] Stop!
-[laughs]

36:11.043 --> 36:12.128
Stop rowing.

36:14.213 --> 36:17.383
What do you see
that makes you believe that we are lost?

36:17.466 --> 36:18.718
What do I see?

36:20.261 --> 36:22.013
No land!

36:22.096 --> 36:24.223
See, that is where
you and I are different.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.226
The sky tells me we are headed west.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.395
Auks and gannets flying high

36:29.478 --> 36:33.316
tell me the weather is improving
and we're near land.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.947
Then where are the other boats?

36:40.781 --> 36:44.160
The other boats are not my responsibility.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.372
This boat, the one you are on,

36:49.665 --> 36:52.668
is my responsibility.

36:55.963 --> 36:59.050
For all you know,
the other boats are lost, not ours.

36:59.759 --> 37:02.595
Now, we continue!

37:03.471 --> 37:04.805
Oars out and row!

37:06.182 --> 37:12.063
And, Jarl Gorm, stop blaming
the Christians for your fears. Hmm?

37:14.774 --> 37:16.943
[laughing]

37:19.320 --> 37:20.696
[Gorm grunts]

37:20.780 --> 37:22.657
-[gasps]
-[intense music playing]

37:22.740 --> 37:23.991
[Skarde] What are you doing?

37:24.075 --> 37:25.618
The Christians have cursed us!

37:25.701 --> 37:28.287
-They all must die!
-Birger.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.666
[Liv panting]

37:31.749 --> 37:33.084
I'm taking over the boat.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.337
-[Leif] Let them go! Now!
-Get the weapons.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.966
-Let them go!
-Or what, Greenlander?

37:40.508 --> 37:41.717
You're going to kill me?

37:41.801 --> 37:46.013
I'm not a bear. And you are not a Viking.

37:47.306 --> 37:50.851
I don't think you have
the stomach to kill me.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.523
A polar bear thinks
the same thing before he dies.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.233
[both grunting]

38:05.866 --> 38:06.867
[Gorm groans]

38:06.951 --> 38:09.578
When I pull this out, you will be dead.

38:10.329 --> 38:13.249
Before I do, tell your men what you see.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.752
Tell them.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.630
[straining] England.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.090
[Gorm thuds]

38:23.092 --> 38:24.176
Who's next?

38:28.139 --> 38:29.348
[Edmund] What did Streona mean

38:29.432 --> 38:32.476
when he called your father
the destroyer of your family name?

38:32.560 --> 38:34.103
[Godwin] My father was an Ealdorman.

38:34.186 --> 38:36.647
When I was your age,
he took 24 of the king's ships

38:36.731 --> 38:38.357
and used them for his own greed.

38:39.191 --> 38:41.277
For that act,
he was stripped of his lands,

38:41.360 --> 38:45.072
his wealth, and his title,
and was imprisoned until his death.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.577
How is it then, that you are now
one of my father's closest advisors?

38:50.578 --> 38:53.164
Because he never blamed me
for my father's failure.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.709
And I provide him with something
he cannot get from his nobles.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.377
Which is?

39:00.004 --> 39:01.589
The truth, Your Highness.

39:06.135 --> 39:08.721
[bells tolling in distance]

39:11.223 --> 39:14.101
Listen. What does that mean?

39:16.604 --> 39:18.105
It means you are now our ruler.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.275
All hail King Edmund.

39:21.359 --> 39:25.654
[all] All hail King Edmund.
All hail King Edmund.

39:25.738 --> 39:29.450
[Godwin] God bless the King.
And God bless England.

39:29.533 --> 39:32.953
[all] God bless the King.
God bless England.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.663
Now comes the hard part.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.712
[footsteps approaching]

39:41.796 --> 39:43.464
[mystical music playing]

39:50.346 --> 39:52.098
Why have you returned my knife?

39:52.973 --> 39:54.850
You will need it for your pilgrimage.

39:55.393 --> 39:59.480
I'm sending you to Uppsala
to seek your destiny.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.234
[sheathes knife]

40:03.317 --> 40:04.819
I don't understand.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.905
Uppsala is the most sacred site
in our Viking world.

40:08.614 --> 40:09.907
Everything there is holy.

40:10.866 --> 40:14.370
Every nine years we make sacrifices there
to the Gods that protect us.

40:14.995 --> 40:17.748
And you, who have travelled so far,

40:17.832 --> 40:22.753
you must go there and see it for yourself
before the Christian tide washes it away.

40:24.713 --> 40:26.257
Is that really possible?

40:26.882 --> 40:30.386
Some say that Ragnarök,
the Twilight of the Gods,

40:30.469 --> 40:32.388
will happen within our lifetime.

40:33.639 --> 40:34.807
And you believe that?

40:38.269 --> 40:40.020
I believe we must be ready.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.189
[gripping instrumental music playing]

40:50.573 --> 40:51.657
[horses neighing]

41:03.085 --> 41:04.795
[indistinct shouting]

41:15.139 --> 41:16.390
Sound the horn.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.976
[horn blowing]

41:37.578 --> 41:39.413
[intense music playing]

42:22.248 --> 42:23.207
Viking.

42:24.416 --> 42:26.168
[Leif breathing heavily]

42:35.177 --> 42:37.054
[theme music playing]
