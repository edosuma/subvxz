00:14.000 --> 00:20.680
ARURA VILLAGE
NORTH OF RAMALLAH

00:27.120 --> 00:29.400
[ARABIC]
[How are you, Abu Bassal?]

00:31.720 --> 00:34.880
[-May God have mercy on his soul.]
[-It's a great honor that you came.]

00:35.040 --> 00:38.880
[Abu Bassal, I am honored to be]
[in the presence of a Shahid's father.]

00:39.040 --> 00:41.160
[Your son was a true hero.]

00:42.160 --> 00:45.440
[Abu Bassal, this is from
The Movement in Amman.]

00:45.600 --> 00:48.960
[It's just a small portion, of course.
We take care of our men.]

00:49.120 --> 00:50.720
[-Thank you.]
[-You're welcome, sir.]

00:50.880 --> 00:55.020
[Take care of yourselves.
We will be in touch.]

00:55.180 --> 00:56.480
[What's going on?!]

00:57.120 --> 01:00.360
[-Where to?]
[-Don't move!]

01:33.640 --> 01:35.240
[Abu Halil,]

01:35.400 --> 01:37.680
[you visit the West Bank
and don't come to say hi?]

01:37.840 --> 01:40.120
[You Hamas folks
have no manners.]

01:40.640 --> 01:44.400
[So you brought me in here
just to crack jokes?]

01:45.200 --> 01:48.800
[Of course not, pal.
I brought you here to help you.]

01:48.960 --> 01:52.120
[To help me?
Thanks a lot.]

01:53.800 --> 01:58.140
[I've heard different rumors, Abu Halil.
Rumors from Amman.]

01:58.300 --> 01:59.600
[Such as?]

01:59.760 --> 02:02.520
[They say that the Hamas
has begun suspecting you.]

02:02.680 --> 02:06.880
[Suspecting me? Of what?]

02:08.080 --> 02:09.880
[They put lots of money
in your hands]

02:10.040 --> 02:14.240
[and somehow, a portion
of that money always seems to...]

02:14.400 --> 02:15.920
[...evaporate.]

02:16.960 --> 02:18.520
[Nonsense.]

02:18.680 --> 02:20.520
[That's just what I told them.]

02:20.680 --> 02:22.840
[As I said before,
I want to help you.]

02:23.280 --> 02:28.840
[They said, "Look, he traveled
to the West Bank with $50,000]

02:29.000 --> 02:32.240
[but arrived with only $45,000."]

02:33.080 --> 02:36.920
[You're just making up the numbers,
it's nonsense.]

02:37.080 --> 02:40.320
["Nonsense",
that's exactly what I told them.]

02:40.520 --> 02:42.240
["Don't bash him",
I said.]

02:42.400 --> 02:45.920
["He's a devoted, longtime Hamas
member and was always faithful.]

02:46.080 --> 02:48.280
[Have you no shame?"]

02:48.440 --> 02:51.120
[But then
they presented me with this...]

02:52.440 --> 02:54.080
[Check it out.]

02:56.560 --> 03:00.000
[Sums, dates,
bank accounts,]

03:00.160 --> 03:01.600
[names, everything.]

03:01.760 --> 03:03.600
[Still say it's nonsense?]

03:03.760 --> 03:05.640
[You call this "nonsense"?]

03:08.360 --> 03:10.720
[Help me so I can help you.]

03:12.160 --> 03:16.040
[I don't want these figures to appear
on walls around the West Bank.]

03:16.680 --> 03:18.880
[Everyone here can read.]

03:19.720 --> 03:21.320
[You met with Abu Ahmad.]

03:22.720 --> 03:23.880
[Abu Ahmad is dead.]

03:24.040 --> 03:26.320
[Abu Ahmad is alive.
Give us a little credit, will you?]

03:26.480 --> 03:28.200
[Abu Ahmad is dead.]

03:28.360 --> 03:31.920
[If I reveal what I know,
Abu Ahmad won't be the only dead guy.]

03:32.080 --> 03:33.920
[Where did you meet with him?]

03:37.160 --> 03:38.720
[I don't know.]

03:38.880 --> 03:42.520
[They took me there
with a Kaffiyah over my eyes.]

03:43.360 --> 03:45.600
[What did he want from you?]

03:56.400 --> 04:00.560
[If I tell you, will you keep it a secret
and let me go home?]

04:02.800 --> 04:06.280
[It's not up to me, but I'll do my best.
Sometimes it helps.]

04:08.000 --> 04:10.880
[If he finds out I told you,
he will have me killed.]

04:11.040 --> 04:12.920
[He won't find out.]

04:22.760 --> 04:25.800
[I brought him
sarin nerve gas.]

04:43.760 --> 04:45.520
God damn it!

04:51.280 --> 04:54.120
Don't touch that crap.
Better eat some fruit.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.240
-Again with the red cell phone?
-This phone rang.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.720
Walid Al-Abed, Abu Ahmad's
right-hand man, called it.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.800
I heard them talk,
Doron wasn't kidding,

05:10.960 --> 05:12.960
he really did penetrate
the Hamas.

05:13.120 --> 05:16.760
They're meeting with him tomorrow
at 10 a.m. before his suicide attack.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.440
He gave him
the exact coordinates.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.840
Gideon, they'll be using
sarin gas in this attack.

05:24.080 --> 05:28.280
It's the worst nerve gas there is,
500 times more deadly than cyanide.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.120
-How did they get it?
-Abu Halil smuggled it in

05:31.280 --> 05:34.080
from Jordan or Syria.
What's the difference?

05:34.320 --> 05:36.680
It's coming our way, Gideon.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.400
Would you risk a mass-casualty event
during your term now that you know?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.440
Thank you.

05:57.640 --> 06:02.200
And if Doron survives, you release him
and grant him a full pardon.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.880
-Where've you been? Hawaii?
-Sure, Hawaii not...?

07:19.360 --> 07:23.280
-We've been worried sick, bro.
-Get a room, you guys.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.200
-How've you been?
-Steve, give us a minute.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.760
So I've got
good news and bad.

07:36.880 --> 07:41.040
The good news is,
Steve will take you home.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.920
The bad news is...

07:44.360 --> 07:47.840
...you get to be a suicide bomber
like you wanted.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.840
-I am?
-You are.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.120
And there's a bonus:

07:54.280 --> 07:56.080
If you make it out alive,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.880
Gideon will let you off the hook
completely. You'll be a free man.

08:03.240 --> 08:07.480
-It's what you wanted, right?
-Yes. When do we leave?

08:11.280 --> 08:12.800
Steve!

08:23.600 --> 08:25.920
I think we've gone too far, bro.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.280
I can't.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.640
Can't go back?

08:41.120 --> 08:44.880
How could I,
after what I've done?

08:48.480 --> 08:51.000
It's like the tale about the bear
and the rabbit. Know it?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.600
No.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.640
A bear and a rabbit
go to poop in the forest.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.040
The bear asks the rabbit,

08:58.200 --> 09:00.400
"Doesn't it bug you
when shit sticks to your fur?"

09:00.560 --> 09:02.600
The rabbit says,
"Not at all."

09:02.760 --> 09:05.720
So the bear grabs the rabbit
and wipes his ass with him.

09:09.680 --> 09:13.760
-What's that got to do with anything?
-Nothing, bro. That's just it.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.720
You've got a home,
so return to it.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.040
I'd like to thank the directors
and staff at Assaf Harofeh Hospital

09:24.200 --> 09:28.520
for giving us the opportunity
to have Nassrin and Abir Hammed,

09:28.760 --> 09:30.800
and hopefully,
we will someday

09:30.960 --> 09:35.040
get to see them again
under merrier circumstances.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.360
Nassrin, you've got the sweetest
and bravest girl that I ever saw.

09:38.520 --> 09:41.280
-God bless her.
-Thank you, Doctor.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.960
[-So? How are you doing?]
[-Praise God.]

09:47.120 --> 09:49.800
-They say the kid is alright.
-Thank you.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.920
[She was so happy
to get that teddy bear.]

09:54.960 --> 09:58.160
[It's weird how kids
love stuffed teddy bears,]

09:58.320 --> 10:00.640
[more than cats,
dogs or bunnies.]

10:00.800 --> 10:03.120
[Teddy bears are
the all-time favorite.]

10:03.280 --> 10:05.120
[Because they're still young.]

10:05.280 --> 10:08.640
[They don't know
that bears are predators.]

10:11.960 --> 10:15.480
[Nassrin,
I need to tell you something,]

10:16.560 --> 10:18.320
[but don't be mad at me.]

10:23.160 --> 10:26.640
[Here are your and your children's
German passports.]

10:26.800 --> 10:29.040
[The taxi is waiting outside.]

10:29.200 --> 10:33.480
[You'll arrive at a hotel in Tel Aviv,
your son Ahmad is waiting there.]

10:35.240 --> 10:37.760
[Tomorrow the three of you
will fly to Berlin.]

10:37.920 --> 10:40.440
[I'll arrange a house for you.]

10:59.840 --> 11:02.000
[And there's no way back?]

11:09.280 --> 11:10.920
[Nassrin,]

11:12.760 --> 11:17.640
[if you ever need anything,
no matter what]

11:17.800 --> 11:19.720
[or when,]

11:21.160 --> 11:23.440
[I will be at your service.]

11:45.720 --> 11:50.480
[-Hello?]
[-Taufiq, my son, they've taken Ahmad.]

11:51.360 --> 11:53.040
[Who did?]

11:53.200 --> 11:54.680
[The army.]

11:54.840 --> 11:59.720
[And they took the German passports
of Nassrin and the children!]

12:06.160 --> 12:09.280
[Alright, Mother, don't cry.]

12:09.440 --> 12:11.080
[Poor Ahmad,]

12:11.240 --> 12:13.480
[he didn't understand
what's going on.]

12:13.640 --> 12:16.600
[The poor thing just wants
to be with his mother.]

12:20.200 --> 12:23.360
[He is with her now, Mother.]

12:23.600 --> 12:25.800
[So why did they kidnap him?]

12:26.920 --> 12:29.880
[Nassrin is taking
the children to Berlin.]

12:30.040 --> 12:31.960
[It's her decision.]

12:32.240 --> 12:35.960
[You must stop them, my son.]

12:36.200 --> 12:39.000
[Please, stop them.]

12:40.000 --> 12:41.960
[Alright, Mother.]

12:43.040 --> 12:47.240
[I must hang up now.
Don't worry.]

12:48.080 --> 12:49.520
[Everything will be alright.]

12:49.680 --> 12:51.400
[Taufiq...]

14:29.600 --> 14:31.480
Can you stop here, please?

14:37.440 --> 14:39.320
[Give me the teddy bear.]

14:58.760 --> 15:00.400
[Momma, why did you do that?]

15:00.560 --> 15:04.200
[I'll buy you a nicer teddy bear.
This one is no good.]

15:04.480 --> 15:06.640
[I want my teddy bear,
it's good.]

15:06.800 --> 15:09.320
[-No, my child, it's not.]
[-It is too!]

15:09.480 --> 15:13.720
[Abura, gifts from the Jews
are very dangerous.]

15:13.880 --> 15:18.080
[We don't want nor need anything
from them. Always remember that.]

15:18.240 --> 15:22.480
[The doctor who treated me is a Jew,
so is the man who gave me the bear.]

15:22.640 --> 15:26.240
[Yes, but it's the Jews' fault that
you even ended up in a hospital.]

15:26.400 --> 15:28.000
[Understand?]

15:28.160 --> 15:32.240
[-No, I want my teddy bear.]
[-I'll get you a nicer one.]

15:32.920 --> 15:34.840
[No, I want the Jewish teddy bear.]

15:35.000 --> 15:38.840
[Abura,
calm down.]

15:41.240 --> 15:43.160
[I hate you!]

15:45.880 --> 15:48.480
[Go inside.
Come on, my child.]

15:57.720 --> 15:59.400
[Momma, may I?]

15:59.560 --> 16:01.360
[Yes, darling.]

16:03.120 --> 16:04.880
[I'm hungry.]

16:05.160 --> 16:07.680
[Soon we'll go out to eat, darling.]

16:08.280 --> 16:09.640
[Who would like some tea?]

16:09.800 --> 16:11.920
[-I would.]
[-Me too.]

16:12.080 --> 16:14.360
[Great, we'll have a tea party.]

16:46.000 --> 16:47.760
What are we doing here?

16:52.120 --> 16:54.520
Bro, I'll come here
some other time.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.440
"Exalted and hallowed
be His great Name

17:26.040 --> 17:29.480
throughout the world which
He created according to His will.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.440
May He establish His kingship,
bring forth His redemption

17:31.600 --> 17:33.640
and hasten the coming of His Moshiach
in your lifetime and in your days

17:33.800 --> 17:34.840
and in the lifetime of
the entire house of Israel,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.520
speedily and soon; and say, Amen.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.440
May His great Name be blessed
forever and to all eternity.

17:41.640 --> 17:46.160
Blessed and praised, glorified,
exalted and extolled, honored, adored

17:46.600 --> 17:48.720
and lauded be the Name
of the Holy One blessed be He.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.640
Beyond all the blessings, hymns,
praises and consolations

17:52.800 --> 17:55.120
that are uttered in the world;
and say, Amen.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.720
May there be abundant peace
from Heaven and a good life

17:59.880 --> 18:01.880
for us and for all Israel;
and say: Amen.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.600
He Who makes peace in His heavens,
may He make peace for us

18:04.760 --> 18:07.280
and for all Israel;
and say, Amen."

18:38.400 --> 18:41.000
-Ido...
-Hands up!

18:44.800 --> 18:48.120
-Ido, be careful, it's very dangerous.
-My daddy isn't here because of you!

19:00.240 --> 19:01.840
Idodi?

19:02.560 --> 19:05.760
Idodi, put the gun down.
Put it down.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.240
Gali, there's a bullet in the barrel.
I'll handle this.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.400
Sweetie, put the gun down,
everything's alright.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.520
Put the gun down.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.680
Ido, what are you doing?!

19:22.680 --> 19:24.400
Put the gun down.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.840
He and Mom are together!

19:45.360 --> 19:47.120
Get the hell out.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.200
I should have killed him.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.080
Daddy!

20:27.000 --> 20:28.440
Hey.

20:28.960 --> 20:33.840
-Daddy, what happened to Ido?
-Nothing. He's fine.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.680
Daddy, Uncle Boaz died.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.200
I know.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.680
And Mommy is sad.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.480
So am I.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.440
[Momma, where are we going?]

20:55.720 --> 20:59.160
[We're going to Grandma Hafida,
in Germany.]

20:59.320 --> 21:00.960
[It's a beautiful country.]

21:01.120 --> 21:03.240
[Did you know I grew up there?]

21:03.880 --> 21:05.880
[Is Grandma Jihan
coming with us?]

21:06.040 --> 21:07.920
[Yes, she is.]

21:08.080 --> 21:12.040
[-Are there televisions there?]
[-Awesome televisions.]

21:13.920 --> 21:15.800
[I don't want to go.]

21:16.040 --> 21:18.160
[Abura, did you know
that Grandma Hafida]

21:18.320 --> 21:21.360
[lives an hour away
from an amusement park?]

21:21.840 --> 21:23.240
[What's that?]

21:23.760 --> 21:30.560
[It's a big playground with games
and swings, like you see on TV.]

21:31.280 --> 21:33.080
[I don't care.]

21:34.680 --> 21:38.000
[-I do want to go.]
[-We will, my son.]

22:05.400 --> 22:07.840
[-Tasty, huh?]
[-Thanks.]

22:09.920 --> 22:11.600
[-Some orange soda?]
[-No.]

22:13.080 --> 22:15.320
[Don't you like it?]

22:16.520 --> 22:19.160
[Sometimes,
but I usually don't drink]

22:19.320 --> 22:21.200
[sugary drinks.]

22:21.360 --> 22:23.000
[Oh...]

22:24.880 --> 22:27.240
[What do you usually drink?]

22:28.960 --> 22:30.400
[Orange juice.]

22:30.560 --> 22:32.800
[-Freshly squeezed, or--]
[-Whichever.]

22:40.560 --> 22:43.080
[What about my proposal?]

22:46.760 --> 22:48.080
[Well...]

22:48.240 --> 22:51.720
[-I'm thinking about it.]
[-What's there to think about?]

22:51.920 --> 22:53.400
[Just say "yes"
and I'll take you to--]

22:53.560 --> 22:55.460
[Fine.]

22:55.620 --> 22:57.360
[I'm thinking.]

23:07.320 --> 23:09.760
[-Walid...]
[-Open it, don't be shy.]

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
[You shouldn't have.]

23:15.640 --> 23:18.480
[From this day on,
I will protect you.]

23:18.640 --> 23:21.760
[I will give you
the best possible life.]

23:25.200 --> 23:27.200
[It's not that simple.]

23:27.360 --> 23:29.000
[It's very simple.]

23:29.160 --> 23:31.960
[If you value your life,
marry me.]

23:32.880 --> 23:34.720
[We live in great chaos,]

23:34.880 --> 23:38.680
[but as my wife,
no one would dare harm you.]

23:48.840 --> 23:50.720
[Okay then.]

23:52.280 --> 23:54.080
[Okay what?]

23:54.240 --> 23:55.560
[What's okay?]

23:55.720 --> 23:57.400
[I will marry you.]

24:30.160 --> 24:31.960
[I'll have some orange soda.]

24:32.120 --> 24:33.680
[-Want some?]
[-Yeah.]

25:01.760 --> 25:03.320
Need help?

25:04.840 --> 25:06.400
No, thanks.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.960
Do you want to break up?

25:19.840 --> 25:22.440
You found someone new,
didn't you?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.840
Are you fucking Naor?

25:29.880 --> 25:32.280
Answer me already!

25:36.200 --> 25:37.520
What do you want me to say?

25:37.680 --> 25:41.160
I'm dying to hear why you're
fucking my friend behind my back!

25:43.240 --> 25:45.240
Because he loves me

25:46.800 --> 25:49.200
and loves sleeping with me.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.680
-Sorry.
-Is that so, Gali?

25:51.840 --> 25:54.600
Every Arab off the street
would do you.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.000
What are you fighting for?

25:58.320 --> 26:00.520
Are you fighting over me?

26:01.440 --> 26:04.800
It's been over for a long time
and you know it.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.360
You didn't fight for me.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.440
Did you ever fight for me?

26:19.840 --> 26:22.280
I have been, for years.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.120
But you were never here
to actually see it.

26:27.280 --> 26:31.240
How I was waiting up for you
to come back every night,

26:32.280 --> 26:34.320
lying to the kids,

26:35.960 --> 26:38.400
to myself,

26:39.720 --> 26:41.720
loving you.

26:42.160 --> 26:45.560
I loved you even though
I'm afraid of you.

26:48.800 --> 26:53.000
Why be afraid of me, huh?

26:53.160 --> 26:55.040
I did everything for you!

26:55.280 --> 26:57.280
I did everything I could
to bring your brother back!

26:57.720 --> 26:59.240
Yes, but...

27:02.120 --> 27:05.240
...you brought him back dead.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.680
[Don't go.]

30:22.200 --> 30:23.920
[Abu Ahmad.]

30:26.600 --> 30:29.400
[Abu Ahmad, just tell me
what's in that bag.]

30:32.120 --> 30:34.120
[Redemption.]

30:36.440 --> 30:38.880
[The suicide bomber
will use it tomorrow.]

30:39.600 --> 30:41.480
[Sarin nerve gas.]

30:42.360 --> 30:45.920
[-Do you know what it does?]
[-No.]

30:47.200 --> 30:49.800
[First it feels
like you have a cold.]

30:50.800 --> 30:53.240
[Then you start to choke.]

30:53.400 --> 30:56.640
[Then you vomit
and choke to death.]

30:58.880 --> 31:00.880
[It could lead to war.]

31:01.040 --> 31:04.920
[Well, what do you think
we've been engaged in so far?]

31:05.080 --> 31:08.400
[-You know what I'm talking about.]
[-You're right.]

31:08.560 --> 31:10.680
[You have no idea
how right you are.]

31:10.960 --> 31:14.160
[The bombing will take place
in a synagogue.]

31:15.480 --> 31:17.520
[In a synagogue?]

31:21.240 --> 31:23.520
[The Jews will respond]

31:23.880 --> 31:26.320
[with an extremely severe retaliation.]

31:26.760 --> 31:29.920
[They'll be committing
such unprecedented war crimes,]

31:30.760 --> 31:35.400
[that all Islamic states
will intervene, including Iran.]

31:35.600 --> 31:38.560
[By the time America decides
to step in, it will be too late,]

31:38.720 --> 31:42.160
[for it will be the beginning
of the end of the Zionists.]

31:42.760 --> 31:44.600
[But it's exaggerated.]

31:44.760 --> 31:47.920
[We've never carried out anything
like this before, or used nerve gas.]

31:48.080 --> 31:51.240
[Think again. Think big.]

31:51.400 --> 31:54.840
[Everything we've done to this day
has brought us to this moment.]

31:55.000 --> 31:58.840
[This bombing will change the entire
balance of power in the Middle East.]

31:59.000 --> 32:00.760
[We'll go down in history.]

32:00.920 --> 32:03.640
[-But there will be so many casualties.]
[-That's the goal.]

32:03.800 --> 32:07.880
[I'm talking about our side,
not theirs, once they retaliate.]

32:09.920 --> 32:12.240
[You must send Nassrin
and the children away.]

32:16.840 --> 32:18.680
[Are you alright?]

32:20.480 --> 32:22.160
[We need to resolve this issue.]

32:22.320 --> 32:25.640
[I've already taken care of it.
Stop pestering me.]

32:37.400 --> 32:42.560
<i>[Lord, give her health]</i>

32:43.800 --> 32:47.000
<i>[Every day]</i>

32:48.400 --> 32:54.180
<i>[Go to sleep, go to sleep]</i>

32:54.340 --> 32:59.080
<i>[I will bring you a dove]</i>

33:01.640 --> 33:06.920
<i>[A dove in flight,</i>
<i>and you will believe my words]</i>

33:07.200 --> 33:11.960
<i>[I'm trying to get Abura to sleep]</i>

33:12.960 --> 33:17.400
<i>[Sweet, sweet Abura]</i>

33:18.160 --> 33:23.220
<i>[With your lovely black hair]</i>

33:23.380 --> 33:26.880
<i>[Everyone who loves you]</i>
