WEBVTT

03:21.202 --> 03:22.737
Nice moves.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.872
You new here?

03:26.173 --> 03:27.208
Yeah.

03:28.109 --> 03:29.643
I can't really
afford lessons, though.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.645
Oh no, no, no.
I don't work here.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.814
I'm just a regular.
My name's Alisha.

03:33.848 --> 03:34.882
Dia.

03:36.017 --> 03:36.984
Let me give you a few tips.

03:37.018 --> 03:38.551
Everyone needs a guidin' hand.

03:38.585 --> 03:39.787
- Yeah, sure.
- Sometimes, right?

03:39.820 --> 03:41.989
- Uh-huh.
- Right.

03:42.023 --> 03:43.224
Okay.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.059
All right. Wanna go
over your left jab?

03:45.092 --> 03:46.193
Not really.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.495
Kind of like the...
the Ray cross,

03:48.528 --> 03:49.797
like Mike Tyson.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.698
Okay. Well, let's work
on that jab first.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.565
Okay.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.035
It's the most important
punch in boxing.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.535
Everything else
stems from there.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.804
- All right.
- Okay.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.538
Just, just hit your hand?

03:58.571 --> 03:59.707
Yeah.
Let me see what you got.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.945
Yeah.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.780
Yeah, you can step into it.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.181
Yup, step left.

04:08.682 --> 04:09.649
Step left.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.650
Step right.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.987
Cross, cross, cross.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.156
See, when you're jabbing,

04:16.223 --> 04:17.224
you're finding your range.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.726
But right now, you're just
extending your arm.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.593
You gotta rotate
your body into it.

04:20.627 --> 04:21.996
You gotta rotate your body.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.530
Rotate into it.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.199
Exactly, rotate into it.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.101
Right. And keep
your right shoulder back.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.235
Yeah, right there.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.071
- Aha.
- Okay, let's do it again.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.105
Let's go.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.574
Yeah, chin down.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.843
- Mm-hmm. Cross.
- Mm-hmm.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.012
You got a good jab though.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.213
Yeah.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.214
- That was fun.
- Wow.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.681
- Can we do it again?
- Yeah.

04:41.716 --> 04:42.615
Yeah?

04:42.649 --> 04:43.985
You know what,
hold on, I got somethin'.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.059
Uh, you know what?
Actually, I just, um, realized

04:52.093 --> 04:53.894
I had a couple of errands
that I needed to run.

04:53.928 --> 04:56.063
But listen,
thank you so much.

04:56.097 --> 04:57.231
I gotta go. Thank you.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.598
Yeah, yeah.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.049
You got anything
that's gonna stick me?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.050
Nah, just a needle

05:16.083 --> 05:17.051
- in my pocket.
- Sir, turn over.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.052
What?

05:21.889 --> 05:25.192
Nice bust.
Let's share the collar.

05:25.226 --> 05:26.593
Okay.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.902
- Nice work, kid.
- Thank you, sir.

05:34.935 --> 05:35.903
You think
you're a real cop now?

05:36.937 --> 05:39.006
Parks, you file the paperwork?

05:39.040 --> 05:40.274
I did.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.574
You can go home.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.324
Fucking, fucking,
fucking.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.659
Fuck yeah, fuck yeah,
fuck yeah.

06:07.835 --> 06:08.936
Be right back.

06:22.049 --> 06:22.917
What the fuck are you doing?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.118
Sorry, I was just
trying to make sure

06:24.151 --> 06:25.152
you weren't gonna stiff me.

06:25.186 --> 06:26.153
I shouldn't give you shit.

06:26.187 --> 06:27.254
I did my job.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.994
This is all you're worth.

06:36.931 --> 06:38.332
Get the fuck outta here.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.307
- Happy Fourth.
- Thanks, Jason.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.151
- Hey!
- What'd you get?

07:00.321 --> 07:01.288
This it?

07:01.322 --> 07:02.356
Hmm-mm.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.357
You couldn't swipe him,
or nothing?

07:03.390 --> 07:04.258
That's all
he would give me.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.927
Come on.
You're fuckin' cherry, girl.

07:06.961 --> 07:08.329
We'll work it out.
All right?

07:08.362 --> 07:10.331
What? How are we supposed
to fix with this?

07:10.364 --> 07:11.432
We can split. All right?

07:11.465 --> 07:13.134
I can't split with you.
I need a fix.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.236
I need a fucking fix too
so I can work for us, all right?

07:15.269 --> 07:16.403
Work it out.

07:18.339 --> 07:19.840
Okay.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.008
I'll be back in a minute.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.337
Here.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.472
Oh, nice,
nice, nice, nice.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.974
Look, I want first.
I earned it.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.042
All right.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.043
Relax.

08:38.052 --> 08:39.086
Let me see that.

08:59.173 --> 09:00.441
Shit!

09:00.474 --> 09:02.109
Shit.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.011
Fuck!

09:04.044 --> 09:05.412
You dumb bitch.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.382
That was our setup
for the night.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.986
I'll have to get more tar.

09:13.354 --> 09:14.788
I'm so tired.

09:16.457 --> 09:18.025
You wanna score or not?

09:20.361 --> 09:21.362
Fuck.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.556
Hey!

10:55.589 --> 10:57.224
How are you guys doing tonight?

11:27.254 --> 11:29.089
Hey, howz your night going?

11:30.090 --> 11:32.459
Good. You working?

11:32.493 --> 11:34.328
Depends. You payin'?

11:41.135 --> 11:44.938
I know a good motel nearby.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.974
No.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.208
I want to keep it quick.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.378
There's an alley
two blocks away.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.148
Sure.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.184
What do you want?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.086
Hmmm?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.287
You want a girlfriend?

12:03.490 --> 12:04.625
A girlfriend?

12:04.658 --> 12:06.493
Yeah, you know.

12:06.527 --> 12:11.031
You, me, nothin' in between.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.232
No rubber.

12:14.668 --> 12:15.936
No.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.338
I don't need a girlfriend.

12:21.709 --> 12:22.877
Hey, Boo.

12:22.911 --> 12:24.578
<i>Hey, babe! What's your ETA?</i>

12:24.611 --> 12:27.181
Actually... I'm at the store.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.550
What else do we need
for the night?

12:29.583 --> 12:32.319
<i>How about,
Jamaican Rum, Myers.</i>

12:32.352 --> 12:35.322
Uh, that's a hard no.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.492
I'm gonna surprise you
with whiskey.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.727
Well, what do you want?

12:43.297 --> 12:45.466
You look familiar.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.234
You live around here?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.602
Why? You writin' a novel?

12:49.771 --> 12:51.572
Hey. You...

12:51.605 --> 12:53.140
You passed the alley.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.577
Hey!

13:12.459 --> 13:14.328
Hmm.
But you see me every night.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.163
<i>Yeah, but I want to go big</i>

13:16.196 --> 13:17.564
<i>for our one-year anniversary.</i>

13:17.598 --> 13:20.167
I mean, when you say it
like that, who can resist?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.302
Okay, babe,
I will see you soon.

13:22.336 --> 13:23.570
<i>Okay, see you soon.</i>

13:33.447 --> 13:35.649
Oh, no!

13:41.488 --> 13:43.123
Thanks.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.564
Keep it.

13:55.770 --> 13:57.170
Hey!

13:57.204 --> 13:58.505
Everything all right?

13:58.539 --> 13:59.774
Oh yeah,
everything's fine.

13:59.807 --> 14:01.375
She's just a little drunk.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.376
Getting her home,
don't you worry.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.377
Sir.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.411
Sir!

14:06.446 --> 14:07.447
Sir!

14:46.721 --> 14:48.756
Back so soon?
You forget somethin'?

14:48.790 --> 14:50.490
Let me see
your security tapes.

14:50.524 --> 14:51.525
Uh, I don't know.

14:53.527 --> 14:55.629
Okay, so you push this button
to play the video files.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.899
And this one to toggle forward.

14:57.932 --> 15:00.300
I... I think I can
handle it from here.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.769
- Okay.
- Hmm-mm.

15:01.803 --> 15:03.805
Just, uh, let me know
if you need anything.

15:03.838 --> 15:04.806
Will do.

15:04.839 --> 15:06.306
Okay.

15:25.860 --> 15:26.861
Hey, babe. I'm sorry.

15:26.894 --> 15:29.262
I just got caught up
in some, some work stuff.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.765
- <i>Work stuff?</i>
- Hmm-mm.

15:30.798 --> 15:32.499
<i>Nothing serious, right?</i>

15:32.532 --> 15:35.502
No, I just, um...

15:35.535 --> 15:36.738
something came up.

15:36.771 --> 15:40.207
Let me, I will see you at home
in about an hour, so, okay?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.441
<i>Okay baby, see you soon.</i>

15:41.475 --> 15:42.509
Yeah.

18:19.734 --> 18:21.434
I don't know why
you piss away money

18:21.468 --> 18:22.804
on that garbage.

18:22.837 --> 18:24.571
The girls don't even
show it all.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.907
Most of the hottest
celebrities,

18:25.940 --> 18:28.341
the ones you watch
the shitty TV shows for,

18:28.375 --> 18:29.309
they're not gonna show it all.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.645
They only do spreads
in the soft magazines.

18:31.678 --> 18:32.914
And, best of all,

18:32.947 --> 18:35.582
nobody can say shit
about this to Shelby.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.484
Why wouldn't you
just read Playboy?

18:37.517 --> 18:38.920
I can't bring Playboy
into the station.

18:38.953 --> 18:40.054
Oh, sure you can.

18:40.087 --> 18:41.688
What about the girls?

18:41.722 --> 18:43.657
Girls in Playboy
wear clothes now.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.892
Yeah, you didn't hear that?

18:44.926 --> 18:45.860
What?

18:45.893 --> 18:47.895
What's this fucking country
comin' to, huh?

18:47.929 --> 18:49.629
You know, the real thing
about Playboy is just...

18:49.663 --> 18:51.065
there's journalism in there.

18:51.098 --> 18:53.100
You know, real journalism.

18:53.134 --> 18:54.568
- All right.
- Vonnegut,

18:54.601 --> 18:56.904
Roald Dahl,
Hunter S. Thompson.

18:56.938 --> 18:58.438
Roald Dahl?

18:58.471 --> 18:59.472
The kids' author?

18:59.506 --> 19:00.507
Yeah.

19:01.709 --> 19:02.743
What? He wrote for adults, too.

19:02.777 --> 19:03.811
Like what?

19:03.845 --> 19:04.912
Like what, I don't know.
That's not the point.

19:04.946 --> 19:07.480
The point is, they're all there
to read in Playboy.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.382
I can't believe
fucking Playboy bunnies

19:09.416 --> 19:10.517
wear clothes now.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.819
Uh-mmm...

19:14.188 --> 19:15.488
I thought you were off duty?

19:16.290 --> 19:18.625
Yeah, I just want
to run something by you.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.061
Something suspicious that I saw.

19:21.128 --> 19:22.429
Suspicious?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.266
<i>Yo, I'm angry.</i>

19:25.299 --> 19:26.300
<i>I've had enough
of these people,</i>

19:26.334 --> 19:30.037
<i>these Christian-hating scum.
These liberals,</i>

19:30.071 --> 19:32.505
<i>they literally crawl out
from underneath rocks</i>

19:32.539 --> 19:36.110
<i>with their boozy, weird,
green looking skin,</i>

19:36.143 --> 19:39.412
<i>or Black, or White,
doesn't really matter.</i>

19:39.446 --> 19:41.782
<i>Deep down,
it's what's inside,</i>

19:41.816 --> 19:44.551
<i>and it's ugly, people.
It's ugly, America.</i>

19:44.584 --> 19:45.920
And that's when
he drove off with her.

19:47.587 --> 19:50.057
Well, this really doesn't
necessarily mean so much, Parks.

19:50.091 --> 19:51.125
It didn't feel right, sir.

19:51.158 --> 19:53.127
It felt like she was being
forced into the vehicle.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.462
Or maybe she was
just pulling trick.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.430
All right. We'll file
a Missing Person's report,

19:57.464 --> 19:58.866
but I wouldn't get
too worked up about it.

19:58.900 --> 20:00.600
Someone can check it out
in the morning.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.136
Somethin' like this, she could
be dead by the morning.

20:02.169 --> 20:03.170
That neighborhood.

20:03.204 --> 20:04.471
These street girls.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.806
They're all NHI's.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.708
These girls go missing,
nobody notices.

20:07.742 --> 20:09.176
I notice.

20:09.210 --> 20:10.978
I found a syringe in the drain.

20:11.012 --> 20:12.213
It may have rolled out.

20:12.246 --> 20:13.814
- May have?
- When I approached him.

20:13.848 --> 20:15.016
Was she a working girl?

20:15.049 --> 20:16.050
Yeah, I think so.

20:16.083 --> 20:16.918
Well, alert the press;

20:16.951 --> 20:19.153
a needle falls out
of a hooker's ass.

20:19.186 --> 20:20.620
Probably a pimp guidin' her
back to the car.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.156
Can we at least have
the syringe analyzed?

20:22.189 --> 20:24.025
Well, we can have
the syringe analyzed.

20:24.058 --> 20:25.826
Sure, why not?

20:25.860 --> 20:27.661
We'll have someone
analyze the syringe.

20:29.063 --> 20:31.065
I spoke to the store owner.

20:31.098 --> 20:32.833
Security footage.

20:34.969 --> 20:36.003
Oh, really!

20:37.537 --> 20:38.706
Really.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.486
All right.
We'll bring this to Shelby.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.522
And we will
check out the syringe.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.559
<i>Pizzagate is real, America.</i>

20:59.592 --> 21:01.929
<i>Wake up!
Wake up, sheepeople!</i>

21:01.963 --> 21:03.097
<i>It's real.</i>

21:03.130 --> 21:07.001
<i>They are literally abducting
children off the street.</i>

21:07.034 --> 21:08.668
<i>It's gotta be investigated.</i>

21:09.469 --> 21:12.173
So, he took off, and, um,
I found this on the sidewalk.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.876
And then I got the video.

21:15.910 --> 21:17.845
Officer,
this doesn't look like

21:17.878 --> 21:19.213
a department issue
evidence bag.

21:19.246 --> 21:21.614
Sorry, Captain,
it's what the deli had.

21:22.649 --> 21:23.918
So you got a needle.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.252
And a video, sir.

21:25.286 --> 21:26.619
Let me see it.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.161
She's loaded.

21:34.195 --> 21:35.662
File a missing person.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.632
Corbucci, you and I need to
talk alone for a second,

21:39.666 --> 21:43.170
about protocol
and chain of command.

21:43.204 --> 21:44.805
Officer Parks, wait outside.

21:50.144 --> 21:52.612
This is what you got?
You got a needle in a baggie.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.882
You're gonna bring this rookie
in here and present this

21:54.915 --> 21:56.583
like I'm supposed to do
something with it?

21:56.616 --> 21:58.719
She witnessed it, sir.

21:58.753 --> 22:00.553
Well, if she saw
what we just saw on that video,

22:00.587 --> 22:02.323
we're gonna need more than that.

22:02.356 --> 22:03.958
Yes, sir.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.292
Dismissed.

22:11.332 --> 22:13.834
Hey, Parks.

22:13.868 --> 22:16.669
Maybe you should do some
diggin' on who that girl is.

22:16.704 --> 22:17.872
On your own.

22:17.905 --> 22:20.174
- Yeah, it's good to know.
- I'll check the license plate.

22:20.207 --> 22:21.909
- All right?
- Uh, Sarge...

22:21.942 --> 22:23.811
what's an NHI?

22:26.247 --> 22:27.748
Don't worry about that.

24:29.103 --> 24:31.038
Shhh. Shh-shh-shh-shh.

24:35.976 --> 24:38.712
Don't scream,
don't scream.

24:38.746 --> 24:40.347
Okay? Atta girl.

24:41.348 --> 24:42.917
What do you want?

24:42.950 --> 24:46.987
You wanna how many times
I've done this?

24:47.021 --> 24:48.088
Hmmm?

24:49.790 --> 24:53.294
One... two...

24:53.327 --> 24:55.863
three...

24:55.896 --> 24:58.265
four...

24:58.299 --> 25:00.434
five.

25:00.467 --> 25:01.969
Five!

25:02.002 --> 25:03.170
Help!

25:03.204 --> 25:05.806
Help! Somebody!

25:05.839 --> 25:07.374
Help me!

25:07.408 --> 25:10.010
Help! Help!

25:10.044 --> 25:12.913
Someone help! Somebody,
please help! No!

25:15.482 --> 25:17.851
Help!
Please help me!

25:17.885 --> 25:18.953
Somebody!

25:18.986 --> 25:21.855
Somebody help me!

25:21.889 --> 25:25.025
No! No!

25:31.332 --> 25:32.733
Help!

26:31.458 --> 26:32.526
Yeah.

26:43.370 --> 26:45.039
He said
I'd find you here.

26:47.941 --> 26:48.942
Who?

26:48.976 --> 26:51.378
Jason.
Your friend at the motel?

26:51.412 --> 26:52.446
I don't know who that is.

26:52.479 --> 26:54.515
You don't know who that is.

26:54.548 --> 26:56.517
Okay, well, he said you and
this girl hang out together?

26:58.585 --> 27:00.354
I'm trying to help her.

27:00.387 --> 27:01.322
She got into a guy's car.

27:01.355 --> 27:02.523
I don't think she wanted
to be in that car.

27:02.556 --> 27:04.258
Do you understand
what I'm sayin'?

27:04.291 --> 27:06.393
I'm not after you.
Do you know her or not?

27:11.131 --> 27:13.467
Do the right thing
and help me help her.

27:19.540 --> 27:22.476
How about I buy you dinner,
and we talk, hmm?

27:22.509 --> 27:23.510
Okay.

27:27.214 --> 27:28.248
Look, let me go.

27:28.282 --> 27:29.249
I-I'll act
like it never happened

27:29.283 --> 27:30.918
and I won't tell anyone,
I swear.

27:35.389 --> 27:37.524
Let me guess.

27:37.558 --> 27:40.394
You're the victim, hmm.

27:40.427 --> 27:43.097
Always innocent.

27:43.130 --> 27:47.101
Always tormented...
by a rigged system.

27:48.969 --> 27:52.973
And tell me,
you chose to get in the car...

27:53.006 --> 27:56.977
so all this, is it not
by your own choosing?

27:57.010 --> 27:59.279
I'm sorry if I...

27:59.313 --> 28:01.482
Don't interrupt me!

28:01.515 --> 28:02.649
That's rude.

28:04.485 --> 28:08.389
You sell your body
on the fucking street.

28:11.058 --> 28:13.594
You turned yourself
into a junkie.

28:13.627 --> 28:17.398
You could have had an education.
You could have had a life.

28:17.431 --> 28:20.033
And instead, you decided
to be a parasite.

28:20.067 --> 28:24.037
You know, you women,
you choose to be unwanted...

28:24.071 --> 28:26.708
Hmm. We approach.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.512
And you choose.

28:34.681 --> 28:36.950
You forfeited your choice.

28:39.319 --> 28:40.487
Now I choose.

28:45.092 --> 28:46.160
Now I have the power.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.464
Oh fuck! God!

28:53.768 --> 28:57.037
Usually, she works the alley
between Maple and Elm.

28:57.070 --> 29:00.107
Unless the trick paid, and they
went to that motel on Willow.

29:00.140 --> 29:02.476
The clerk, he kicks us a piece
for bringing guys there.

29:02.509 --> 29:04.044
He left that little detail out.

29:05.512 --> 29:07.047
So tell me, what's her name?

29:08.549 --> 29:11.385
Ricki, Ricki Fennel.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.287
I know her maybe like
three months.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.289
She was 16.

29:15.322 --> 29:17.491
Molly. That was her D.O.C.
for a while,

29:17.524 --> 29:18.592
until she tried Skag.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.563
Once you try that...

29:22.596 --> 29:23.597
nothing else matters.

29:23.630 --> 29:27.568
It's like... all you
care about is getting it,

29:27.601 --> 29:29.436
and so you don't
have to care again.

29:32.439 --> 29:33.440
Is there anything else?

29:34.441 --> 29:37.544
Uh, she hated school work.

29:37.578 --> 29:41.448
She said that the words
got all jumbled in her head.

29:41.482 --> 29:43.350
Dyslexia.

29:43.383 --> 29:44.985
All right, thank you.

29:46.620 --> 29:49.757
Um... do you think
this is connected

29:49.791 --> 29:51.225
with those other missing girls?

29:51.258 --> 29:52.693
Other missing girls?

30:02.135 --> 30:03.470
- Corbucci.
- <i>Sarge,</i>

30:03.504 --> 30:04.706
<i>I got a name.</i>

30:04.739 --> 30:07.775
Ricki Fennel, and get this.
She's a junior in high school.

30:07.809 --> 30:09.243
I think I got us a case here.

30:09.276 --> 30:10.444
Well, bingo.

30:10.477 --> 30:11.813
She's just a kid.

30:11.846 --> 30:13.647
Dropped out of high school,
ran away from home.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.148
I checked out
the license plate,

30:15.182 --> 30:16.250
and it's a dead-end.

30:16.283 --> 30:17.251
Suspects don't match.

30:17.284 --> 30:19.386
<i>Owner's a Black guy in his 60s.</i>

30:19.419 --> 30:20.487
Can you check
the footage again?

30:20.521 --> 30:22.155
I think we missed something.

30:22.189 --> 30:23.190
<i>I was told
there have been multiple girls,</i>

30:23.223 --> 30:25.225
<i>matching Ricki's description
going missing.</i>

30:26.593 --> 30:30.097
Parks, the track suit,
the multi-tool, the gloves.

30:30.130 --> 30:32.232
He's done this before.

30:32.266 --> 30:35.302
Get back here. We'll bring this
to Shelby again.

30:35.335 --> 30:36.303
Copy.

30:38.806 --> 30:40.073
<i>You shouldn't have done that.</i>

30:49.516 --> 30:51.084
You know what that is?

30:51.118 --> 30:54.254
It's a police scanner.

30:55.589 --> 30:57.457
That means that no one's
ever gonna find you.

30:58.860 --> 31:00.728
It means that no one...

31:05.198 --> 31:06.333
no one found her...

31:07.802 --> 31:09.202
no one's found her...

31:09.236 --> 31:10.772
no one found her...

31:10.805 --> 31:13.106
no one... found her...

31:15.175 --> 31:17.344
and no one's
ever gonna find you.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.817
I'm gonna enjoy killing you.

31:26.888 --> 31:28.756
Nice work, Parks.

31:28.790 --> 31:31.391
So, this girl, Ricki Fennel,
is a minor.

31:31.425 --> 31:32.626
That's something.

31:32.659 --> 31:35.429
Um... let's get
an Amber Alert out.

31:35.462 --> 31:36.530
Who else is available?

31:36.563 --> 31:38.599
Sir, with the holiday,
we're a little short on men.

31:38.632 --> 31:41.435
I think Parks should do a deep
dive on similar missing persons.

31:41.468 --> 31:43.637
Anyone fitting the same
description as our girl.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.909
I'll give her temporary
clearance, for tonight.

31:47.942 --> 31:49.576
So it's up to you two.

31:49.610 --> 31:51.846
Thank you, sir. I'm ready.

31:53.180 --> 31:54.181
We'll see.

31:56.650 --> 31:59.252
Okay, but wait. Don't I need
access to do case research?

31:59.286 --> 32:00.587
You can use my password.

32:00.621 --> 32:03.256
The number four, Sara and Jimmy.

32:03.290 --> 32:04.257
No "h" in Sara.

32:04.291 --> 32:05.525
Your kids?

32:05.559 --> 32:06.560
Yup.

32:20.607 --> 32:21.642
What are you still doin' here?

32:24.812 --> 32:28.950
Whoa! You're working
that missing girl case?

32:28.983 --> 32:30.550
Yeah. You wanna help?

32:30.584 --> 32:33.587
Lookout, America.
She's on the case.

32:33.620 --> 32:34.554
You know, I'd like
to help you out,

32:34.588 --> 32:36.824
but my shift ends
five minutes from now.

32:39.326 --> 32:40.160
Come on.

32:40.193 --> 32:41.729
She'll still be missin'
in the mornin'.

32:41.763 --> 32:42.529
Go the fuck home, Steve.

32:42.562 --> 32:45.632
Have a good night, hero.

32:49.536 --> 32:51.839
Who... are you?

33:05.585 --> 33:08.756
You're a student...
at Rivendell High?

33:09.957 --> 33:10.958
Yeah.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.395
How old are you?

33:51.364 --> 33:52.532
How old are you?

33:55.036 --> 33:59.673
Sixteen.

33:59.707 --> 34:01.241
You're sixteen.

34:15.056 --> 34:16.858
She's six-sixteen.

34:25.632 --> 34:27.869
Wait, wait,
please don't do that.

34:27.902 --> 34:28.970
Okay, okay, okay.

34:29.003 --> 34:31.404
Okay, okay, okay.

34:31.438 --> 34:33.673
Please, I couldn't
stay in school.

34:34.976 --> 34:37.011
No one cares about
a girl like me?

34:39.646 --> 34:41.381
Please don't...

34:41.414 --> 34:43.517
don't, just listen.

34:43.550 --> 34:48.355
I feel like if we think...

34:48.388 --> 34:52.325
if we just think... we can
get out of this together.

34:52.359 --> 34:55.529
Please, please.

34:57.397 --> 34:58.431
Please.

35:43.677 --> 35:44.712
Hey, I found the mom.

35:46.580 --> 35:48.783
No surprises.
Single parent.

35:48.816 --> 35:49.951
You know, tough life.

35:54.487 --> 35:56.690
You want to talk
to the mom with me?

35:56.724 --> 35:57.892
Sure, yeah.

35:59.459 --> 36:00.460
Bring her into the station.

36:12.740 --> 36:13.975
<i>Please advise, there's a 902</i>

36:14.008 --> 36:16.744
<i>on watch from [indistinct]
Boulevard, unknown number of...</i>

36:25.585 --> 36:26.653
Shit.

36:28.588 --> 36:31.658
Shit.

36:34.494 --> 36:38.665
So, where we at?

36:38.698 --> 36:39.699
Nothing yet.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.502
You know, these traffic cameras
are usually used

36:42.535 --> 36:44.705
to nail people
who run red lights.

36:44.739 --> 36:47.842
But in a situation like this,
we use them to track a suspect.

36:49.210 --> 36:50.410
I know that, Lou.

36:53.647 --> 36:56.650
The problem is that
every area is different,

36:56.683 --> 36:58.753
so we have to
go through 'em all.

36:58.786 --> 36:59.787
Oh! Whoa, whoa!

37:01.255 --> 37:03.124
What's that?

37:03.157 --> 37:05.893
- Yeah, you think that's the car?
- That is it.

37:05.927 --> 37:07.995
So what do you think?
Is he in that garage?

37:08.029 --> 37:09.063
There's only one way
to find out.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.164
Yeah.

37:10.197 --> 37:11.165
Let's go.

37:23.711 --> 37:25.512
I looked up NHI.

37:28.648 --> 37:31.953
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. No human involved?

37:33.687 --> 37:35.522
It started in the LAPD,
all those years,

37:35.555 --> 37:37.191
they "weren't looking"
for The Grim Sleeper.

37:37.224 --> 37:38.658
I know.

37:38.692 --> 37:39.693
You know?

37:41.162 --> 37:43.030
Hmm-mm.

37:43.064 --> 37:45.132
Let me...
let me ask you a question.

37:45.166 --> 37:48.970
If I looked like Ricki,
if I dressed like her,

37:49.003 --> 37:50.537
would you be able
to tell the difference?

37:51.973 --> 37:54.574
Is that...
how you see these women?

37:54.607 --> 37:55.675
Of course not, Alisha.

37:58.545 --> 38:00.014
No human involved.

38:01.548 --> 38:03.884
That cops' slang
for dead, black hookers?

38:12.559 --> 38:17.031
Because these girls,
they need us more than anybody.

38:18.232 --> 38:19.100
<i>You know, we won't follow</i>

38:19.133 --> 38:22.203
<i>these lemmings
blindly off a cliff.</i>

38:22.236 --> 38:24.939
<i>They try and do
false flag events</i>

38:24.972 --> 38:28.309
<i>with their crisis actors,
telling everyone what to do.</i>

38:28.342 --> 38:29.910
<i>But we won't fall for it.</i>

38:29.944 --> 38:33.280
<i>We know better.
We've always known better.</i>

38:33.314 --> 38:35.648
<i>They can try and pass laws or...</i>

38:38.019 --> 38:40.087
He never took off those gloves.

38:40.121 --> 38:41.554
Well, at least we know
he left in a different car

38:41.588 --> 38:42.823
than he came in.

38:42.857 --> 38:44.258
We can figure out
who left the garage

38:44.291 --> 38:45.226
in the traffic cam. Right?

38:45.259 --> 38:48.329
Okay, there's nothing to do
but, go ahead.

38:48.362 --> 38:50.297
How many cars left
in that window of time?

38:50.331 --> 38:52.166
<i>Over
50 licenses in a half-hour.</i>

38:52.199 --> 38:53.367
Shit. We'll never
get through that many.

38:53.401 --> 38:55.903
Can you see if
we have any matches on our guy?

38:55.936 --> 38:57.204
<i>Copy that. By the way, Officer,</i>

38:57.238 --> 38:58.873
<i>girl's mother will be
arriving at the station</i>

38:58.906 --> 39:00.274
<i>in about 15.</i>

39:00.307 --> 39:01.308
Copy.

39:44.318 --> 39:45.685
Can I get you, hon?

39:46.854 --> 39:49.290
A cranberry...
no, no, no, no.

39:49.323 --> 39:50.291
Whiskey straight up.

39:50.324 --> 39:51.658
Whiskey.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.097
Hey, baby.

39:56.130 --> 39:57.965
- Hi!
- How's your night going?

40:03.104 --> 40:05.773
Better.

40:05.806 --> 40:06.807
Thank you.

40:10.010 --> 40:12.146
You free?

40:12.179 --> 40:15.950
Nothing's free,
but... I'm available.

40:18.919 --> 40:20.020
You want a private room?

40:22.189 --> 40:24.024
Hell ya.

40:24.058 --> 40:25.359
Hmmm.

40:25.392 --> 40:27.061
Bring the bottle.

40:38.105 --> 40:39.306
<i>Be on the lookout</i>

40:39.340 --> 40:40.741
- <i>for a man in a black hoodie...</i>
- Somebody help please.

40:40.774 --> 40:43.344
I don't feel good.
Help, please.

40:51.252 --> 40:53.053
<i>Please advise 91,</i>

40:53.087 --> 40:55.089
<i>the store on the corner
of Nine and Sullivan.</i>

41:05.032 --> 41:07.067
Ms. Fennel, we want
to thank you for coming in.

41:07.101 --> 41:09.203
I'm Sgt. Louis Corbucci.

41:09.236 --> 41:10.938
This is Alisha Parks.

41:10.971 --> 41:12.273
We just wanna ask you
a few questions

41:12.306 --> 41:13.474
about your daughter, Ricki.

41:13.507 --> 41:14.708
What did she do?

41:15.543 --> 41:17.478
I haven't seen that girl
in six months.

41:17.511 --> 41:21.382
Ma'am, we have reason
to be concerned about her.

41:21.415 --> 41:22.416
Is she okay?

41:24.518 --> 41:27.121
We believe
she's been kidnapped.

41:27.154 --> 41:30.257
Yup, uh, but we don't
know that for sure.

41:30.291 --> 41:32.026
Any information you have
could save her life.

41:32.059 --> 41:34.128
Oh god!

41:34.161 --> 41:36.030
Uh, um, I haven't seen her
in six months.

41:36.063 --> 41:37.831
I don't know anything.
Is she all right?

41:37.865 --> 41:39.767
We're doing everything
we can to find her.

41:39.800 --> 41:43.103
Please!
She's my little girl.

41:43.137 --> 41:44.772
You have to bring her back.

41:45.606 --> 41:47.441
I promise we are
gonna bring her back.

41:50.544 --> 41:51.745
Thank you.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.748
Mrs. Fennel, we're gonna...

41:54.782 --> 41:56.350
we're gonna send
a counselor in here.

41:56.383 --> 41:58.185
Thank you for coming in.

41:58.219 --> 41:59.220
Thank you.

42:03.891 --> 42:04.959
Don't look back.

42:14.401 --> 42:15.402
<i>You fucked up.</i>

42:16.804 --> 42:18.339
We don't make promises.

42:18.372 --> 42:20.741
That woman was hurtin' Sarge.
What was I supposed to say?

42:22.243 --> 42:23.310
We don't say that.

42:25.212 --> 42:27.314
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

42:27.348 --> 42:28.482
- Sarge...
- What?

42:28.515 --> 42:29.416
A guy in a track suit

42:29.450 --> 42:31.518
last seen with
at least one little girl.

42:34.989 --> 42:36.857
Lisa Andrews.

42:36.890 --> 42:38.158
You know anything else
about her?

42:38.192 --> 42:40.194
No, just right there,
that's all I got.

42:47.001 --> 42:49.036
Let me try and get a little bit
more information on her, Alisha.

42:53.307 --> 42:54.575
I'm glad you're here tonight.

42:54.608 --> 42:56.010
I know.

42:56.043 --> 42:57.311
Holidays are weird.

42:57.344 --> 42:58.812
I wasn't even supposed
to be here tonight,

42:58.846 --> 43:00.447
but I owed Michelle a favor.

43:02.916 --> 43:07.221
You know, I...
I love seeing you.

43:07.254 --> 43:09.290
You just like the way
I rile you up.

43:11.458 --> 43:15.029
Actually... ,
I like the way you calm me down.

43:27.274 --> 43:30.344
You know, I'm planning...
on going away.

43:30.377 --> 43:31.378
Yeah?

43:33.447 --> 43:35.582
Would you come with me?

43:35.616 --> 43:38.218
Where are we going, baby?

43:38.252 --> 43:45.426
Uh, well...
I was thinking... Costa Rica.

43:45.459 --> 43:47.061
Costa Rica.

43:47.094 --> 43:48.195
Hmmm.

43:48.228 --> 43:50.097
Why not Brazil?

43:50.130 --> 43:52.032
Yeah?

43:52.066 --> 43:54.335
I've been saving up
for a trip with my boyfr...

43:57.438 --> 44:00.441
With your... with your who?

44:00.474 --> 44:01.475
My friend.

44:07.214 --> 44:09.049
Sit down.

44:09.083 --> 44:10.117
Sit down.

44:22.663 --> 44:23.897
I think...

44:27.101 --> 44:28.268
I feel like...

44:32.206 --> 44:35.242
you see me
for who I really am.

44:37.077 --> 44:38.078
Sweetheart...

44:40.681 --> 44:42.149
can I give you some advice?

44:43.718 --> 44:47.521
These places,
they're like cotton candy.

44:47.554 --> 44:50.391
A little, on occasion,
is fine,

44:50.424 --> 44:52.393
but too much
and they'll rot your teeth.

44:56.363 --> 44:57.364
Yeah.

45:01.101 --> 45:04.538
Do you have any, uh...
do you have any oxy?

45:04.571 --> 45:05.539
I don't.

45:12.246 --> 45:15.048
I think Claire has
some coke in her locker.

45:20.687 --> 45:22.289
Meet me out back?

45:22.322 --> 45:23.323
Yeah.

45:54.388 --> 45:57.191
Hey, Sarge, I was just
trying to help the mom.

46:02.196 --> 46:03.197
Smoke?

46:07.067 --> 46:08.068
I'm serious.

46:13.674 --> 46:16.043
You know, three weeks
after I made detective,

46:16.076 --> 46:18.645
I got my first big case.

46:18.679 --> 46:20.748
Her name was Katie.

46:23.050 --> 46:27.421
Cute little girl,
big buck tooth smile.

46:27.454 --> 46:31.258
She was playin' foursquare
with this neighbor kid.

46:31.291 --> 46:34.027
This guy comes up to them
with two frosties,

46:34.061 --> 46:35.195
chocolate and strawberry.

46:35.229 --> 46:36.630
What kid doesn't like
ice cream, right?

46:40.400 --> 46:42.536
Anyway, this kid,
this neighbor kid,

46:42.569 --> 46:44.137
this lucky fucking kid,

46:44.171 --> 46:46.607
he says no
because he's diabetic.

46:46.640 --> 46:47.674
He doesn't eat ice cream.

46:50.377 --> 46:52.212
Anyway, so I... you know,
I ask around.

46:54.214 --> 46:55.817
You know, some people,
they swear they saw his face,

46:55.850 --> 46:58.051
but then, I get
a-a mixed eyewitness.

46:59.486 --> 47:01.255
But what I did get
was average, you know,

47:01.288 --> 47:03.290
average height, average weight.
Average, average...

47:03.323 --> 47:05.359
You know, it coulda been
anybody. It coulda been nobody.

47:08.328 --> 47:09.596
But the mom...

47:12.266 --> 47:14.635
this little girl's mom,
I promised her.

47:14.668 --> 47:19.072
See, I promised her
that I'd find her little girl.

47:21.709 --> 47:23.711
And Alisha,
I was a man of my word.

47:26.513 --> 47:28.850
Then weeks go by,
months go by.

47:28.883 --> 47:31.285
And I'm following
every lead that I can,

47:31.318 --> 47:33.420
even the fucking whack-job
leads from the tip line,

47:33.453 --> 47:35.522
I'm following those.

47:35.556 --> 47:37.792
Now my girlfriend leaves me,
and I'm better off without her.

47:37.825 --> 47:39.626
But I didn't know that then.

47:39.660 --> 47:40.895
It wasn't that I wanted...

47:40.929 --> 47:45.232
didn't want to solve that case,
but when a case gets that cold,

47:45.265 --> 47:47.802
and the leads run
that dry, then...

47:52.239 --> 47:53.440
Let's just put it this way,
you know,

47:53.473 --> 47:55.642
I don't make promises anymore.

48:00.782 --> 48:02.115
I'm sorry.

48:05.385 --> 48:09.656
But guys like that,
and guys like your guy...

48:09.690 --> 48:11.491
you listen to me.

48:11.525 --> 48:15.462
Because they wait...
and they wait and they wait.

48:15.495 --> 48:16.496
Then they strike.

48:18.733 --> 48:20.200
I could've stopped him.

48:23.705 --> 48:24.671
No, you couldn't have.

48:24.706 --> 48:26.406
I could've stopped him.

48:32.814 --> 48:35.582
And you know what?
When you make detective,

48:35.616 --> 48:36.851
I'm your reference.

48:53.634 --> 48:55.235
Hey, I got your stuff.

49:04.344 --> 49:06.714
Can I get a hit of that, too?

49:12.252 --> 49:16.323
Woo!

49:16.356 --> 49:18.325
Who're you taking to Rio?

49:21.461 --> 49:22.629
Don't worry about it.

49:25.465 --> 49:28.168
Hey, let's, uh, do some more.

49:32.239 --> 49:35.910
Have you ever had...
feelings for a customer?

49:37.577 --> 49:38.813
Early on, but...

49:40.715 --> 49:42.850
No, no... no.

49:48.455 --> 49:50.524
I said "no",
you fucking weirdo.

49:55.629 --> 49:57.799
I'm not a fucking weirdo.

50:02.302 --> 50:04.671
Fucking weirdo...

50:45.345 --> 50:47.749
Cold, but still good.

50:47.782 --> 50:49.717
No, I'm good.

50:49.751 --> 50:50.852
Try it.

50:54.756 --> 50:56.791
You havin' any luck with
those drivers' licenses?

50:56.824 --> 50:57.959
I don't know.
It's hard to say.

50:57.992 --> 51:00.460
Can't we just go
after all of them?

51:00.494 --> 51:02.596
Not enough men.
Not enough time.

51:04.664 --> 51:06.366
You know, the truth is,

51:06.399 --> 51:08.368
our time is probably up.

51:14.008 --> 51:15.542
That's cheery.

51:15.575 --> 51:16.576
Yeah.

51:19.346 --> 51:20.715
I think I'm gonna call it.

51:22.116 --> 51:24.085
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

51:24.118 --> 51:25.685
Tomorrow's today.

51:31.658 --> 51:33.460
Then I guess I'll
see you guys later today.

52:22.910 --> 52:24.644
Fuck!

52:24.678 --> 52:26.413
Fuck!

53:26.439 --> 53:27.407
<i>This is an Amber Alert</i>

53:27.440 --> 53:29.977
<i>for Rachelle Fennel,

53:31.112 --> 53:34.481

<i>Prime suspect

54:03.576 --> 54:04.845
Shit!

54:07.815 --> 54:09.549
Julia acted tough,
but really,

54:09.582 --> 54:11.252
she was just
such a sweetie, you know.

54:11.285 --> 54:12.853
Everybody loved her.

54:12.887 --> 54:14.855
And poor Anthony. Wha-what's
going to happen to him?

54:14.889 --> 54:16.757
Social Services
will take care of him.

54:16.791 --> 54:18.525
There's nothing else
you remember about the guy,

54:18.558 --> 54:19.659
the suspect?

54:19.693 --> 54:20.493
Like I'd seen him.

54:20.527 --> 54:22.529
He always paid cash.
He was weird.

54:22.562 --> 54:23.530
Most of our guys are, right?

54:23.563 --> 54:27.034
'Cause we're a little bit more,
like, I mean,

54:27.068 --> 54:29.804
we get a, we get
the different guys.

54:32.572 --> 54:33.540
Thank you.

54:33.573 --> 54:34.641
Thanks.

54:36.609 --> 54:38.511
So we got a sex worker
killed with a short blade

54:38.545 --> 54:39.512
from a switch knife.

54:39.546 --> 54:41.048
No, I think it's a multi-tool.

54:41.082 --> 54:43.217
This is our guy.

54:43.250 --> 54:45.086
Yeah, but our guy,
he-he-he's thorough.

54:45.119 --> 54:46.087
He's meticulous.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.022
This-this seems so sloppy.

54:48.055 --> 54:50.057
Yeah, he's changing
his own rules.

54:51.691 --> 54:52.525
Let's go back to the station.

54:52.559 --> 54:53.961
I know that we're
missing something.

54:53.995 --> 54:54.996
Yeah.

55:10.577 --> 55:11.779
Go ahead, answer it.

55:14.148 --> 55:15.216
I can't talk right now.

55:15.249 --> 55:16.951
<i>You could've
told me that earlier.</i>

55:16.984 --> 55:18.786
<i>I've been sittin' here
all night.</i>

55:18.819 --> 55:20.721
<i>I'm in the middle
of a case right now.</i>

55:20.755 --> 55:22.056
I can't talk.

55:22.089 --> 55:24.859
<i>Look, I really value
communication, but I feel...</i>

55:24.892 --> 55:26.193
Look, I'm sorry
I missed our dinner.

55:27.728 --> 55:29.562
<i>Let's talk tomorrow.</i>

55:29.596 --> 55:30.431
<i>Okay.</i>

55:30.464 --> 55:31.932
Pissed you're
blowin' him off, huh?

55:46.679 --> 55:48.182
<i>...wrap up their first series</i>

56:04.398 --> 56:05.598
Back corner.

56:06.500 --> 56:09.236
I'll take a packet of cigs
and, uh...

56:09.270 --> 56:10.237
two bottles of whiskey.

56:10.271 --> 56:11.172
Yeah.

56:19.346 --> 56:21.614
You read this filth?

56:21.648 --> 56:23.250
Who are you, my mother?

56:23.284 --> 56:24.919
How do you fuckin'
look at yourself in the mirror?

56:27.021 --> 56:29.056
It's a free country still.

56:29.090 --> 56:30.958
These girls are barely 18.

56:30.991 --> 56:32.059
Forty-eight fifty.

56:32.093 --> 56:33.227
<i>Here's Joe Panik.</i>

56:33.260 --> 56:34.995
<i>He's over one...</i>

56:56.750 --> 56:58.219
You celebratin' alone tonight?

56:59.720 --> 57:02.356
Hey, that's okay.
Not everybody has friends.

57:16.937 --> 57:18.072
<i>Splinter in the dirt.</i>

57:18.105 --> 57:22.143
<i>Ninety-two on that one,
could not get [indistinct].</i>

58:50.364 --> 58:52.399
The syringe.

58:52.433 --> 58:54.034
Huh?

58:54.068 --> 58:55.436
I want to know where
that needle came from.

58:55.469 --> 58:56.937
Not just its contents.

58:57.938 --> 58:59.506
Let's have the syringe analyzed.

59:01.408 --> 59:04.812
Uh... why don't we
just call it an even 50.

59:04.845 --> 59:06.347
Right?

59:06.380 --> 59:08.082
You're not going to check it?

59:08.115 --> 59:11.919
No, I'll make it work.
And sorry about before.

59:11.952 --> 59:14.488
You're totally right, I really
shouldn't read this shit.

59:14.521 --> 59:16.090
Fuckin depraved.

59:22.429 --> 59:23.430
Yeah.

59:25.833 --> 59:27.301
It is.

59:30.037 --> 59:32.239
- O-kay.
- Fuck!

59:32.273 --> 59:33.841
Whoa, whoa!
No, wait, wait, wait.

59:41.315 --> 59:42.516
<i>Second pitch on its way.</i>

59:42.549 --> 59:43.884
<i>It's a ground ball.</i>

59:47.888 --> 59:49.356
<i>He really can't get a read</i>

59:49.390 --> 59:50.424
<i>from gunthrie...</i>

59:50.457 --> 59:53.994
<i>He's been all over the place.
With one today,</i>

59:54.028 --> 59:56.497
<i>he'll have to take the series
to San Francisco...</i>

59:56.530 --> 59:57.931
<i>Then you go on
to the next series.</i>

59:57.965 --> 59:59.400
<i>And keep that momentum going.</i>

1:00:03.570 --> 1:00:04.571
<i>Bingo!</i>

1:00:05.939 --> 1:00:07.207
We've got him, Parks.

1:00:07.241 --> 1:00:08.342
You were right.

1:00:08.375 --> 1:00:11.078
It is a school-issued syringe
from a science class,

1:00:11.111 --> 1:00:12.279
not a medical standard.

1:00:12.313 --> 1:00:14.615
And... one of our drivers

1:00:14.648 --> 1:00:17.451
is a high school science
teacher at Rivendell.

1:00:17.484 --> 1:00:19.086
Wait! Where Ricki's a student?

1:00:19.119 --> 1:00:20.487
Could be a coincidence,
could not.

1:00:20.521 --> 1:00:22.256
But we're goin' anyway.

1:00:22.289 --> 1:00:26.226
Now... now he lives
in an apartment, right,

1:00:26.260 --> 1:00:28.162
in-in-in a shitty part of town.

1:00:28.195 --> 1:00:29.530
No, he's not doing this
from an apartment.

1:00:29.563 --> 1:00:30.597
He needs a place nice and quiet.

1:00:30.631 --> 1:00:31.465
Yeah, you're right again,
Parks.

1:00:31.498 --> 1:00:34.401
But, you know,
he owns a piece of land

1:00:34.435 --> 1:00:37.104
in Linkin Woods.
Real secluded.

1:00:37.137 --> 1:00:39.073
We are gonna save this one.

1:00:49.416 --> 1:00:50.384
<i>Suspect sighted at</i>

1:00:50.417 --> 1:00:51.985
<i>101 Parliament Road.</i>

1:00:52.019 --> 1:00:53.987
<i>Sending officers now
to apprehend the suspect.</i>

1:00:54.021 --> 1:00:57.291
That's less than a mile
away from Linkin Woods.

1:00:57.324 --> 1:00:58.492
We have to get there first.

1:02:00.421 --> 1:02:02.189
Hi!

1:02:10.697 --> 1:02:13.300
It's a police scanner.
You can only listen.

1:02:24.311 --> 1:02:25.312
<i>[indistinct]</i>

1:02:25.345 --> 1:02:28.415
<i>to Linkin Woods,
for suspect Vince Luscombe,</i>

1:02:28.449 --> 1:02:30.017
<i>sending a helicopter there
immediately.</i>

1:02:30.050 --> 1:02:31.652
Copy that.
We're in hot pursuit.

1:02:31.685 --> 1:02:33.253
En route to location.

1:02:33.287 --> 1:02:34.288
We'll be first on scene.

1:02:34.321 --> 1:02:35.589
Send back-up and SWAT.

1:02:43.230 --> 1:02:44.231
Listen...

1:02:51.405 --> 1:02:52.406
Some things in...

1:02:55.442 --> 1:02:57.077
some things in life...

1:03:00.214 --> 1:03:02.516
they don't always seem good
when they're happening but...

1:03:05.552 --> 1:03:08.222
You know, take you and me,
for instance.

1:03:08.255 --> 1:03:11.024
Could be a blessing in disguise.

1:03:12.794 --> 1:03:14.528
That's what this is...

1:03:15.596 --> 1:03:17.564
Here, take this.

1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:21.201
You first.

1:03:30.611 --> 1:03:32.212
Trust me, you'll need it.

1:03:33.848 --> 1:03:35.048
Hmm-mm.

1:03:40.755 --> 1:03:43.156
Please just let me go.

1:03:47.261 --> 1:03:50.230
I promise...
that's what I'm gonna do.

1:03:51.799 --> 1:03:53.467
Why?

1:03:55.702 --> 1:03:59.473
Now they're gonna show you
mugshots and sketches and...

1:03:59.506 --> 1:04:01.308
and video surveillance.

1:04:01.341 --> 1:04:04.444
You won't be able to confirm
anything, that's the idea.

1:04:04.478 --> 1:04:08.315
And then, we'll both...
look back on this

1:04:08.348 --> 1:04:13.220
and we'll thank each other.
Hmm? Hmm.

1:04:13.253 --> 1:04:17.257
Well... it's a start.

1:04:24.766 --> 1:04:26.667
<i>I can't fucking see.</i>

1:04:26.700 --> 1:04:31.204
- Oh, my eyes!
- My eyes!

1:04:32.306 --> 1:04:35.442
My eyes! I can't...
I can't see.

1:04:40.782 --> 1:04:42.182
Shhh.

1:04:42.215 --> 1:04:44.284
Shh.

1:04:44.318 --> 1:04:47.688
I said, I'm gonna let you go,
but you have to calm down, okay.

1:05:15.850 --> 1:05:17.250
Come on!

1:05:19.219 --> 1:05:20.520
What's going on?

1:05:24.658 --> 1:05:25.827
We're receiving fire.

1:05:25.860 --> 1:05:27.294
Bring it up.

1:05:31.665 --> 1:05:34.501
Please let me go.

1:05:34.534 --> 1:05:35.602
Please.

1:05:45.212 --> 1:05:46.948
They're here.

1:05:46.981 --> 1:05:48.382
Help, help.

1:05:49.917 --> 1:05:53.186
I'll fucking take [indistinct],
all right?

1:05:53.220 --> 1:05:58.760
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1:06:21.314 --> 1:06:22.282
Parks!

1:06:22.315 --> 1:06:23.316
Get back.

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:27.354
<i>Sgt. Corbucci, stand down.</i>

1:06:27.387 --> 1:06:28.790
<i>SWAT's on the way.
Fifteen minutes.</i>

1:06:28.823 --> 1:06:30.323
Fifteen!

1:06:30.357 --> 1:06:31.358
Shit.

1:06:38.398 --> 1:06:39.566
All right, ready?

1:06:39.599 --> 1:06:41.234
Again?

1:06:43.838 --> 1:06:47.975
Help, help, somebody help me.

1:06:48.009 --> 1:06:49.877
- She's still alive.
- Shit!

1:06:49.911 --> 1:06:50.878
Gun is on the
ground!

1:06:50.912 --> 1:06:51.879
Somebody, please help!

1:06:53.781 --> 1:06:55.783
He's hunkered down in a cabin
with a hostage.

1:06:55.817 --> 1:06:56.951
We need backup now.

1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:07.327
Woo!

1:07:28.816 --> 1:07:29.884
Ah!

1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:39.693
They'll be here soon enough.

1:07:39.727 --> 1:07:41.829
Soon isn't soon enough.
And you know that.

1:07:52.039 --> 1:07:53.440
Fuck you.

1:07:53.473 --> 1:07:54.641
All right. All right.

1:07:54.674 --> 1:07:56.744
We're gonna wait 15 minutes,
five minutes. We're gonna...

1:07:56.778 --> 1:07:57.677
We don't have 15 minutes.

1:07:57.712 --> 1:07:58.880
- We don't have five minutes.
- Yes, we do!

1:08:08.555 --> 1:08:09.523
Bah!

1:08:16.130 --> 1:08:17.564
Fuck, yes!

1:08:29.643 --> 1:08:31.913
We will stand down
and wait for backup.

1:08:31.946 --> 1:08:33.748
Guy's got a fuckin'
arsenal in there.

1:08:45.659 --> 1:08:46.828
Captain, we're in position
but we're pinned.

1:08:46.861 --> 1:08:50.397
This guy has bombs scattered
all throughout his property.

1:09:09.116 --> 1:09:10.852
We can't just wait.
We have to go in there.

1:09:10.885 --> 1:09:12.053
Parks, no,
we have to wait for backup.

1:09:12.086 --> 1:09:13.087
There's no time.

1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:14.755
You do what you're told.

1:09:28.568 --> 1:09:29.636
We have to go.

1:09:29.669 --> 1:09:31.873
She is not worth it.

1:09:31.906 --> 1:09:34.507
I'm goin' in there.

1:09:47.722 --> 1:09:49.489
I said I'm goin' in there.

1:09:49.522 --> 1:09:50.523
Parks...

1:09:51.926 --> 1:09:53.928
Oh, God!

1:09:56.663 --> 1:09:58.099
I'm gonna kill you.

1:10:03.137 --> 1:10:04.638
<i>Parks!</i>

1:10:04.671 --> 1:10:06.107
Parks, get back here!

1:10:31.832 --> 1:10:33.600
<i>SWAT, follow the white rocks!</i>

1:10:33.633 --> 1:10:35.136
It's the pathways
around the mines.

1:13:29.676 --> 1:13:31.145
Oh my God, I hate school.

1:13:33.147 --> 1:13:35.416
Shit, I can't be late
for Spanish.

1:13:35.449 --> 1:13:37.818
We already speak Spanish.

1:13:37.852 --> 1:13:39.286
Exactly. Easy A. Bye.

1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:40.653
Bye.

1:13:41.856 --> 1:13:43.190
Don't forget to give
me back my geometry book.

1:13:43.224 --> 1:13:44.391
I got you.

1:13:58.172 --> 1:13:59.173
You're good.

1:14:07.448 --> 1:14:08.883
Shit.

1:14:13.487 --> 1:14:14.788
What's going on?

1:14:14.822 --> 1:14:16.724
I just... dropped my books.

1:14:18.325 --> 1:14:20.327
What House are you in?

1:14:20.361 --> 1:14:21.996
Cooper, sir.

1:14:23.330 --> 1:14:25.299
What are you doing over here?

1:14:25.332 --> 1:14:27.268
Just getting a book.

1:14:30.271 --> 1:14:31.372
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

1:14:31.405 --> 1:14:34.275
I'm just gettin' over something.

1:14:36.844 --> 1:14:38.379
Yeah, uh, come, come here.

1:14:41.949 --> 1:14:43.450
- What's your name?
- Uh, Ricki.

1:14:44.919 --> 1:14:46.086
Ricki.

1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:48.289
You know where
the nurse's office is?

1:14:48.322 --> 1:14:49.456
Yeah.

1:14:53.227 --> 1:14:55.029
Head straight there, okay.

1:15:01.535 --> 1:15:03.137
Thanks.
