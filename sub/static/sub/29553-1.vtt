00:08.509 --> 00:10.070
[news anchor on radio]
The news never ends.

00:10.094 --> 00:12.011
This is 1080 GCR.

00:12.179 --> 00:15.139
You get all the news you need,
all day long.

00:15.933 --> 00:16.933
Good morning.

00:17.101 --> 00:20.228
It's 42 degrees at 10:30 on
this Thursday, October 15th.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.730
I'm Stan I. Brooks,
and here's what's happening.

00:22.898 --> 00:25.108
It's day 18
of the garbage strike,

00:25.275 --> 00:27.902
with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.029
Even the nicest sections
of the city

00:30.114 --> 00:31.447
are looking like slums.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.324
Health Commissioner
Edward O'Rourke is

00:33.409 --> 00:35.118
declaring a city-wide
state of emergency

00:35.285 --> 00:36.911
for the first time in decades.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.199
[O'Rourke] There's no need to
wait until somebody dies

00:39.331 --> 00:40.915
or comes down
with typhoid fever.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.084
It's already
a serious situation.

00:43.252 --> 00:44.354
[news anchor]
It's something that affects

00:44.378 --> 00:45.498
almost everyone in the city,

00:45.629 --> 00:47.672
no matter who they are
or where they live.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.049
[man 1 ] You can't go down
no one avenue

00:50.134 --> 00:52.135
without seeing nothing
but garbage and rats.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.530
[man 2] It's starting to
affect my business

00:53.554 --> 00:54.823
when customers can't get in here

00:54.847 --> 00:56.639
because of
the garbage situation.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.535
[woman 1 ] I'm not out that long
to smell it,

00:58.559 --> 01:00.393
but I think to look at it,
it's terrible.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.019
[man 3]
It don't affect me except

01:02.104 --> 01:03.730
for the very bad smell here.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.897
It's horrific.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.274
[woman 2] It's a mess.

01:06.358 --> 01:07.752
I've been in this country
for 50 years,

01:07.776 --> 01:09.216
and I've never seen
anything like it.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.820
What is this world coming to?

01:10.988 --> 01:12.071
[man 4] Put 'em in a room,

01:12.156 --> 01:13.717
let 'em sit there and talk
until they get it over with.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.950
24 hours, 48 hours,
how long it takes.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.411
[man 5] The idea of
the National Guard moving in

01:18.495 --> 01:19.954
and cleaning up is a good idea.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.242
[news anchor] In other news,

01:21.290 --> 01:22.890
the building industry
and landlords today

01:22.958 --> 01:24.459
expressed concern
over the latest

01:24.543 --> 01:26.335
increase in heating oil prices.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.712
Renters in the metro area

01:27.796 --> 01:29.213
are certain to feel the pinch...

01:29.548 --> 01:30.673
[grunts sadly]

[boy 1 ] Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?

02:05.918 --> 02:06.918
[boy 2] Nice outfit, pal.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.354
[boy 1 ] If you're gonna be
a clown, at least you could be

02:08.378 --> 02:10.004
a good one.
You know that, right?

02:10.923 --> 02:12.317

Come on, clown, let's go!
We've got the sign.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.450

02:20.474 --> 02:21.474
Stop them!

02:21.558 --> 02:23.495

Watch the car, watch the car!

02:25.896 --> 02:27.216

02:58.095 --> 02:59.846
[boy 1 ] Come on!
Beat his ass up.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.813
Come on! This guy's weak.
He can't do nothing.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.850
Harder! Harder!

03:04.017 --> 03:05.268
Beat him up. Take his stuff.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.687
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

[Arthur chuckles]

04:41.239 --> 04:42.239
[Arthur sniffles]

04:51.875 --> 04:53.250
Is it just me,

04:54.419 --> 04:56.921
or is it getting crazier
out there?

05:00.509 --> 05:03.344
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.721
People are upset.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.766
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.309
These are tough times.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.394
[exhales]

05:13.230 --> 05:14.730
How about you?

05:16.358 --> 05:18.442
Have you been keeping up
with your journal?

05:20.237 --> 05:21.988
Yes, ma'am.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.907
Great.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.368
Did you bring it with you?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.040
Arthur.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.543
Last time, I asked you
to bring your journal

05:35.627 --> 05:37.294
with you for these appointments.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.338
Can I see it?

05:51.309 --> 05:54.186
I've been using it as a journal,

05:56.064 --> 05:57.732
but also as a joke diary.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.236
Funny thoughts or observations.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.530
I think I told you

06:04.614 --> 06:07.783
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.830
No, you didn't.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.292
I think I did.

06:24.843 --> 06:28.763
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."

06:31.391 --> 06:32.641
[laughs]

06:44.780 --> 06:47.114
How does it feel to
have to come here?

06:47.532 --> 06:50.284
Does it help to
have someone to talk to?

06:54.331 --> 06:55.581
I think I felt better

06:55.665 --> 06:57.666
when I was locked up
in the hospital.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.961
And have you thought more about

07:02.339 --> 07:03.714
why you were locked up?

07:04.216 --> 07:06.467
[head thudding]

07:09.554 --> 07:11.222
Who knows?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.147
I was wondering
if you could ask the doctor

07:20.232 --> 07:22.149
to increase my medication.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.491
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.411
Surely,
they must be doing something.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.126
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

08:06.945 --> 08:07.945
[gasps]

08:08.029 --> 08:09.029
[laughing]

08:16.204 --> 08:18.372
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

08:21.543 --> 08:22.603
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

08:22.627 --> 08:23.836
Just stop.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.131
[Arthur laughing]

08:32.387 --> 08:34.180
What? You think that's funny?

08:34.264 --> 08:35.973
[continues laughing]

08:41.229 --> 08:42.396
[gagging]

08:42.480 --> 08:44.106
I'm sorry. I have a...
[laughing]

09:00.707 --> 09:01.907
I'm sorry.
[continues laughing]

09:03.835 --> 09:04.835
[woman exhales]

09:09.883 --> 09:11.383
[Arthur continues laughing]

10:29.379 --> 10:31.005
[music playing]

10:36.845 --> 10:37.845
[exhales]

10:40.640 --> 10:42.080
[Penny] Happy,
did you check the mail

10:42.142 --> 10:43.475
before you came up?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.227
Yeah, Mom.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.688
Nothing.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.461
[news anchor 1 on TV]
And finally, tonight,

10:52.485 --> 10:54.486
just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse,

10:54.821 --> 10:55.946
authorities are saying

10:56.031 --> 10:58.490
the city is under siege
by scores of rats.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.950
And not just any rats,

11:00.035 --> 11:02.161
but super rats,
who are hard to kill.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.246
He must not be
getting my letters.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.414
Yeah.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.666
It's Thomas Wayne, Mom.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.251
He's a busy man.

11:09.419 --> 11:13.130
Please. I worked
for that family for years.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.591
The least he could do
is write back.

11:17.135 --> 11:20.304
Here.
Don't get all worked up. Eat.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.472
You need to eat.

11:21.639 --> 11:25.267
You need to eat.
Look how skinny you are.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.518
[clears throat]

[news anchor 1 ] Both victims
were taken to Gotham General.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.646
[news anchor 2] Sounds like

11:29.731 --> 11:30.875
the city needs to
find the Pied Piper.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.567
He'll make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.529
Oh, yeah. Everybody who?
Who do you talk to?

11:38.114 --> 11:40.491
Well, everybody on the news.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.826
He's the only one
who could save the city.

Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

12:45.807 --> 12:48.225
- are in Gotham now, right?
- [audience] Yeah.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.687
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.397
You ready for this?

12:53.565 --> 12:54.648
Super cats.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.400
[all laughing]

12:59.237 --> 13:00.798
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

13:00.822 --> 13:02.322
[Arthur] I love you, Murray!

13:02.449 --> 13:04.074

Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

13:09.164 --> 13:10.164
Who is that?

13:10.331 --> 13:12.499
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.585
Stand up for me.

13:14.752 --> 13:15.752
Go ahead.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.634
What's your name?

13:23.178 --> 13:25.179
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.014
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.909
Oh, okay. Well, there's
something special about you,

13:28.933 --> 13:29.975
Arthur, I could tell.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.143
Where are you from?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.020
I live right here in the city

13:33.188 --> 13:35.148
- with my [stammers] mother.
- [audience laughing]

13:36.232 --> 13:37.418
[Murray] Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.586
There's nothing funny
about that.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.278
I lived with my mother before
I made it. Just me and her.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.281
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

13:44.449 --> 13:45.449
and he never came back.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.575
[audience] Aww.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.660
[Arthur] I know
what that's like, Murray.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.371
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.290
I take good care of my mother.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.380
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.548
She does.

14:02.383 --> 14:06.261
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.056
She says I was put here
to spread joy and laughter.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.599

a lot. Come on down.

Come on. For that,
you gotta come down.

- Come on! Come on.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.656
[upbeat jazz music playing]

14:32.038 --> 14:33.038
Come on.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.298
[audience cheering loudly]

14:48.263 --> 14:50.514
Okay, we got a big show
tonight. Stay tuned.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.474
We'll be right back.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.643
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.562
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.938
It made my day.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.314
Thanks, Murray.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.400
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

15:01.484 --> 15:02.776
the audience, all that stuff?

15:02.944 --> 15:04.171
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

15:04.195 --> 15:05.362
to have a kid like you.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.214
[stretching shoe]

15:36.019 --> 15:38.059
- [indistinct chattering]
- [music playing on radio]

15:44.527 --> 15:45.527
[sighs]

15:47.947 --> 15:49.967
- [Randall] What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

15:49.991 --> 15:51.658
Another day in chuckle town.

15:51.826 --> 15:52.826
[man] Yup.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.456
You okay?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.918
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.754
Fucking savages.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.716
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.842
No.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.345
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.846
All the crazy shit out there.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.098
- They're animals.
- [chuckles]

16:19.604 --> 16:20.896
You know what?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.152
Here.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.072
What is it?

16:30.531 --> 16:31.615
Take it.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.617
It's for you.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.996
[chuckling]

16:38.081 --> 16:40.040
[Randall] You gotta
protect yourself out there.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.292
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.087
Randall,

16:46.547 --> 16:49.174
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.177
Don't sweat it, Art.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.221
No one has to know.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.723
And you can pay me back
some other time.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.100
You know you're my boy.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.227
[laughing]

17:00.311 --> 17:01.311
[Gary] Arthur,

17:01.938 --> 17:03.438
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.692
Hey, Gary. You know
what I've always wondered?

17:06.859 --> 17:07.984
No idea.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.986
Do you people call it
miniature golf

17:10.071 --> 17:11.530
or is it just golf to you?

17:12.490 --> 17:13.782
[Randall and Arthur laughing]

17:16.786 --> 17:18.286
[man] Punch him in the dick,
Gary.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.915
[laughing]

17:35.263 --> 17:36.888
Hello, Hoyt.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.558
Gary said you wanted to see me.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.644
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

17:42.729 --> 17:43.770
Not quite.

17:43.938 --> 17:46.064
Just been
working on my material.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.150
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.818
Look, I like you, Arthur.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.403
You know, a lot of the guys,

17:51.487 --> 17:53.127
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.657
I don't even know
why I like you.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.951
But I got another complaint.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.455
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.457
The guy said you disappeared.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.000
Never even returned his sign.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.669
Because I got jumped.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.755
Didn't you hear?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.673
For a sign?

18:11.841 --> 18:14.009
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.136
Just get him his sign back.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.680
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.640
Why would I keep his sign?

18:20.808 --> 18:23.560
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

18:24.854 --> 18:26.855
If you don't return the sign,

18:27.023 --> 18:29.065
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.276
Are we clear?

18:32.820 --> 18:35.572
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.699
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.242
The other guys,

18:39.327 --> 18:41.167
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

18:41.245 --> 18:43.205
because people
think you're weird.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.208
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.709
[Hoyt continues indistinctly]

18:52.882 --> 18:54.049
[grunting]

19:27.875 --> 19:28.875
[elevator bell dings]

19:31.254 --> 19:32.587
[jabbing buttons]

19:36.008 --> 19:37.050
[Sophie] Wait, wait, wait.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.218
Wait.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.597
Thank you.

20:02.493 --> 20:03.493
[GiGi giggles]

20:04.620 --> 20:07.205
This building is so awful,
isn't it?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.543
This building is so awful,
right, Mommy?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.129
Yes, we can hear you, GiGi.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.631
It's so awful, Mommy.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.258
[imitates gunshot]

20:18.342 --> 20:19.342
Right, Mommy?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.223
[elevator bell dings]

20:27.310 --> 20:28.810
- Good night.
- [GiGi] This building's

20:28.978 --> 20:30.163
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.314
- [baby crying]
- [man shouting]

20:35.651 --> 20:36.651
Hey.

20:38.321 --> 20:39.446
[imitates gunshot]

20:43.367 --> 20:44.367
Come on.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.125
[upbeat music playing]

20:52.919 --> 20:54.127
[door closes]

20:54.211 --> 20:57.964
The moon is a silver dollar

20:58.507 --> 21:01.051
Shining up in the sky

21:01.844 --> 21:03.678
That's the dream we can buy...

21:03.763 --> 21:05.083
- [Arthur] Look up.
- [Penny] Mmm.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.223
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.268
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

21:11.187 --> 21:12.467
What do you think he's gonna do?

21:12.563 --> 21:13.897
He's gonna help us.

21:14.815 --> 21:18.985
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

21:19.153 --> 21:21.029
Why would he help us?

21:21.197 --> 21:23.782
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.243
If he knew how we were living,

21:27.411 --> 21:30.872
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.918
I can't explain it to you
any better than that.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.672
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.132
Or me.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.759
Everybody's telling me

21:42.843 --> 21:45.470
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

21:46.681 --> 21:49.265
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

21:49.767 --> 21:51.476
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

21:52.645 --> 21:54.938
Don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

21:56.482 --> 21:58.775
[men on TV singing]

22:05.950 --> 22:07.951
[men vocalizing]

22:24.802 --> 22:26.761
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

22:26.846 --> 22:29.180
The world is in a mess

22:29.265 --> 22:31.558
With politics and taxes
And people grinding axes

22:31.642 --> 22:32.809
There's no happiness

22:32.893 --> 22:33.893
[Arthur imitates gunshot]

22:34.020 --> 22:36.354
Happiness is not a riddle

22:36.439 --> 22:39.232
When I'm listening to that
Big bass fiddle

22:39.316 --> 22:41.109
[men vocalizing]

22:50.244 --> 22:52.579
Slap that bass
Slap it till its dizzy

22:52.663 --> 22:54.998
Slap that bass
Keep the rhythm busy

22:55.082 --> 22:57.876
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Misery, you've got to go...

22:58.586 --> 22:59.836
Hey, what's your name?

23:01.047 --> 23:02.047
Arthur.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.301
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.136
I know.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.930
You know who's not?
Him.

23:14.769 --> 23:15.894
[increases volume]

23:16.562 --> 23:18.480
[Penny] Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

23:18.647 --> 23:19.689
[Arthur] Mom, what?

23:19.857 --> 23:21.983
[Penny] That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

23:22.151 --> 23:24.402
I'm watching an old war movie!

23:24.570 --> 23:26.071
[Penny] Turn it down!

23:26.322 --> 23:27.572
- Um...
- [men continue singing]

23:32.453 --> 23:34.120
Sorry, Mom.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.206
[children chattering]

23:42.338 --> 23:43.630
[indistinct conversation]

23:46.842 --> 23:47.967
You good?

24:25.548 --> 24:27.173
[indistinct conversation]

24:33.139 --> 24:41.139
[car horn honks]

24:52.408 --> 24:53.908
[audience laughing]

24:55.327 --> 24:57.871
It's nice to see these couples
out at my show.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.040
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.835
- [audience] Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.503
My favorite one right now is

25:05.671 --> 25:08.631
professor and senior
who really needs

25:08.716 --> 25:10.049
to pass my class to graduate.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.134
[audience laughing]

25:11.218 --> 25:12.468
- Yes.
- [audience whooping]

25:13.929 --> 25:15.305
So, I'll tell you how I operate.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.598
I'm a professor at

25:16.682 --> 25:18.201
a prestigious
New England university...

25:18.225 --> 25:19.475
[Arthur laughing]

25:19.727 --> 25:23.605
And my wife is a senior
in my "Intro To Western Civ."

25:23.689 --> 25:25.190
[audience laughing]

25:25.649 --> 25:26.816
I know. I know.

25:27.401 --> 25:30.153
Why is she a senior in the
intro? I didn't buy it either.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.114
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.199
[Arthur laughing]

25:34.283 --> 25:35.883
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.244
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis."

25:38.412 --> 25:40.330
I can't use my real last name
at this college

25:40.497 --> 25:42.040
'cause they don't hire Jews.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.791
[audience laughing]

25:43.876 --> 25:45.126
It's something I'll address

25:45.211 --> 25:46.836
once I have tenure,
but for now...

25:47.546 --> 25:49.172
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis,

25:49.340 --> 25:50.567
I think I might be
in danger of failing

25:50.591 --> 25:51.799
your 'Intro to Western Civ, '

25:51.967 --> 25:53.092
and I just want you to know

25:53.177 --> 25:54.928
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

25:55.721 --> 25:59.140
And I said, "Anything?"
And she said... [moans]

26:50.609 --> 26:51.693
[Arthur chuckles]

26:58.826 --> 26:59.951
[doorbell buzzing]

27:05.874 --> 27:07.917
- [Arthur] Oh, hey.
- Hey.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.461
Were you following me today?

27:14.008 --> 27:15.758
Yeah.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.470
I thought that was you.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.724
I was hoping you'd come in
and rob the place.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.311
I have a gun.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.104
I could come by tomorrow.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.440
[chuckles]

27:31.567 --> 27:33.026
You're so funny, Arthur.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.571
Yeah.

27:36.739 --> 27:39.240
You know, I do stand-up comedy.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.160
You should maybe
come see a show sometime.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.203
I could do that.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.496
Yeah?

27:45.664 --> 27:47.457
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

27:47.624 --> 27:48.624
Yeah.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.759
[man singing] If you're happy
and you know it

27:57.843 --> 27:59.010
Wiggle your ears

27:59.094 --> 28:00.094
[chorus] Wiggle your ears

28:00.179 --> 28:02.388
[all] If you're happy
and you know it

28:02.473 --> 28:04.724
Wiggle your ears

28:04.892 --> 28:07.143
If you're happy and you know it

28:07.227 --> 28:09.312
And you really want to show it

28:09.480 --> 28:11.481
If you're happy and you know it

28:11.565 --> 28:12.690
Wiggle your ears

28:14.109 --> 28:16.069
If you're happy and you know it

28:16.153 --> 28:18.613
Stomp your feet

28:18.697 --> 28:20.698
If you're happy and you know it

28:20.783 --> 28:23.076
Stomp your feet

28:23.243 --> 28:25.453
If you're happy and you know it

28:25.537 --> 28:27.663
And you really want to show it

28:27.831 --> 28:29.957
If you're happy and you know it

28:30.042 --> 28:31.292
Stomp your feet

28:32.669 --> 28:34.170
If you're happy and you know it

28:34.254 --> 28:35.671

- Shout "hurray"

28:35.839 --> 28:37.006
Shout "hurray"

28:37.174 --> 28:39.092
If you're happy and you know it

28:39.176 --> 28:40.593
Shout "hurray"

28:40.761 --> 28:41.821
- Shout "hurray"

28:41.845 --> 28:43.304
If you're happy and you know it

28:43.389 --> 28:45.069
- [Arthur giggles]
- And you really want to

28:45.557 --> 28:49.185
Hoyt, please, I love this job.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.562
Arthur, I need to know why

28:51.647 --> 28:53.773
you brought a gun
into a kids' hospital.

28:53.941 --> 28:56.901
It's a prop.
It's part of my act now.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.903
That's bullshit. Bullshit.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.155
What kind of clown
carries a fucking gun?

29:01.865 --> 29:03.282
Besides, Randall told me

29:03.367 --> 29:06.327
you tried to buy a .38
off him last week.

29:06.495 --> 29:07.537
Randall told you that?

29:07.704 --> 29:10.832
You're a fuck-up, Arthur,
and a liar.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.079
- You're fired!

29:43.991 --> 29:45.427
[man 1 ] I'm telling you,
she wanted my number.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.576
We should've just stayed.

29:46.743 --> 29:49.412
[man 2] You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested at all.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.933
[man 1 ] Are you nuts? Did you
see how close we were dancing?

29:51.957 --> 29:53.040
She was in love.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.728
She couldn't wait to
get away from you.

29:54.835 --> 29:57.170
Ryan! Ryan, am I crazy?
Tell him what you saw.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.836
[slurring drunkenly] Hey,
you want some French fries?

30:04.303 --> 30:05.887
Hello?

30:07.264 --> 30:08.347
Talking to you. Hey.

30:08.515 --> 30:10.057

You sure?

30:16.148 --> 30:17.273
They're real good.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.862
Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.

[Arthur continues laughing]

31:25.717 --> 31:27.510
Isn't it bliss?

31:28.971 --> 31:30.972
Don't you approve?

31:31.974 --> 31:34.141
One who keeps tearing around

31:34.309 --> 31:37.144
And one who can't move

31:37.312 --> 31:40.481
Where are the clowns?

31:40.649 --> 31:44.360
There ought to be clowns

31:54.204 --> 31:57.039
So, buddy, tell us,
what's so fucking funny?

31:57.207 --> 31:58.833
Nothing. [laughing]

32:02.879 --> 32:04.171
I have... I have a condition.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.841
I'll tell you what you have,
you asshole.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.050
[men] Whoa!

32:10.512 --> 32:11.929
[Arthur] Please, stop!

32:12.931 --> 32:14.932
[groans] We got a kicker, huh?

32:15.100 --> 32:16.892
Hey, hold him steady.
Hold him steady.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.666
[man 1 ] I read it was
a guy in full makeup.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.294
[man 2] No, it says right here
it was a mask.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.588
[man 1 ] Either way, I think
it's good for business.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.090
They got clowns on the front
of every newspaper.

["My Name Is Carnival"

37:03.763 --> 37:05.973
Hey, Arthur,
I heard what happened.

37:06.141 --> 37:07.433
Sorry, mate.

37:07.601 --> 37:08.601
[Randall] Yeah.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.519
It doesn't seem fair,

37:10.687 --> 37:12.563
getting fired like that.

37:13.773 --> 37:14.857
Did you really bring a gun

37:14.941 --> 37:16.358
to the children's hospital,
Artie?

37:17.444 --> 37:18.903
What the fuck
would you do that for?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.506
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

37:20.530 --> 37:21.632
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,

37:21.656 --> 37:22.925
you're just gonna
shoot yourself?

37:22.949 --> 37:23.949
[men laughing]

37:24.326 --> 37:25.701
Why don't you
ask Randall about it?

37:26.703 --> 37:27.828
It was his gun.

37:28.288 --> 37:29.849
- [Randall] What?
- I still owe you for that,

37:29.873 --> 37:30.915
don't I?

37:31.082 --> 37:32.833
What the fuck
are you talking about?

37:33.376 --> 37:35.169
Stop talking
out of your ass, Art.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.253
[honking horn]

37:40.300 --> 37:41.675
[Arthur gasps] Oh, no!

37:43.428 --> 37:45.137
I forgot to punch out.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.711
[Chuck on TV] And as our city
tries to make sense

38:17.879 --> 38:21.340
of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week,

38:21.508 --> 38:23.008
we're joined by Thomas Wayne.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.427
Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.

38:25.595 --> 38:26.762
Yes, Mother.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.324
[Thomas] Thanks for
having me on, Chuck.

38:28.348 --> 38:29.640
[Penny]
They're asking him about

38:29.724 --> 38:31.183
those horrible subway murders.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.631
[Chuck] Thank you, Thomas.
I know

38:32.686 --> 38:34.436
this is a difficult time
for you.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.271
Why him?

38:36.439 --> 38:38.315
Looks like he's gained weight.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.563
[Thomas] Yes, all three worked
for Wayne Investments.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.569
Good, decent, educated.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.364
Although I didn't know
any of them personally.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.492
Like all Wayne employees,

38:48.576 --> 38:50.869
past and present,
they're family.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.757
Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.266
- [shushing]
- [Chuck] There now seems to be

38:54.290 --> 38:56.542
a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.

38:56.710 --> 38:58.877
It's almost as if
our less fortunate residents

38:58.962 --> 39:01.171
are taking the side
of the killer.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.007
[Thomas] Yes, and it's a shame.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.466
It's one of the reasons why

39:04.551 --> 39:05.831
I'm considering a run for mayor.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.846
Gotham's lost its way.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.764
What about the eyewitness report

39:10.849 --> 39:13.559
of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?

39:13.727 --> 39:15.728
[Thomas] Well,
it makes total sense to me.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.135
What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?

39:18.273 --> 39:20.107
Someone who hides behind a mask.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.151
Someone who is envious

39:22.235 --> 39:25.654
of those more fortunate
than themselves,

39:26.364 --> 39:29.158
yet they're too scared
to show their own face.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.244
And until those kind of people
change for the better,

39:32.412 --> 39:35.998
those of us who have
made something of our lives

39:36.166 --> 39:38.500
will always look
at those who haven't

39:38.668 --> 39:40.794
as nothing but clowns.

39:41.254 --> 39:42.337
[laughs]

39:42.422 --> 39:44.882
Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.050
It's not funny.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.528
[laughs]

40:07.781 --> 40:10.032
I heard this song on the radio
the other day,

40:12.869 --> 40:16.872
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.

40:18.041 --> 40:19.124
[social worker] Arthur...

40:19.292 --> 40:20.459
Which is crazy,

40:22.837 --> 40:25.881
because that's
my clown name at work.

40:26.966 --> 40:29.426
And until a little while ago,

40:30.678 --> 40:33.180
it was like nobody ever saw me.

40:35.225 --> 40:37.601
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

40:38.019 --> 40:40.395
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

40:43.733 --> 40:45.150
You don't listen, do you?

40:46.820 --> 40:50.823
I don't think
you ever really hear me.

40:51.908 --> 40:54.701
You just ask
the same questions every week.

40:54.869 --> 40:58.163
"How's your job? Are you
having any negative thoughts?"

40:59.207 --> 41:02.918
All I have are
negative thoughts,

41:03.086 --> 41:05.921
but you don't listen anyway.

41:06.089 --> 41:09.466
I said, for my whole life,

41:09.634 --> 41:12.845
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

41:14.055 --> 41:15.764
But I do.

41:17.225 --> 41:21.145
And people are
starting to notice.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.648
They've cut our funding.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.483
We're closing down
our offices next week.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.112
The city has cut funding
across the board.

41:30.196 --> 41:32.156
Social Services is part of that.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.366
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.493
Okay.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.787
They don't give a shit
about people like you, Arthur.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.378
And they really
don't give a shit

41:46.462 --> 41:48.422
about people like me, either.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.010
Fuck.

42:01.227 --> 42:03.729
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

42:06.733 --> 42:08.317
Who do I talk to?

42:10.778 --> 42:12.571
I'm sorry, Arthur.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.911
I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.997
You know, like, "Can I see
myself in this long-term?"

42:22.165 --> 42:24.166
"Is it safe?"

42:24.334 --> 42:25.792
"Is it reliable?"

42:25.960 --> 42:28.212
- "Could it kill me?"
- [audience laughing]

42:28.296 --> 42:30.339
Most guys, we look at sex
like parking a car.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.883
We're like, "There's a spot."

42:33.051 --> 42:34.176
"There's another spot.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.487
- "That would work."
- [Arthur exhales deeply]

42:35.511 --> 42:38.013
"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."

42:38.097 --> 42:39.598
[audience laughing]

42:39.682 --> 42:42.434
"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this."

42:45.146 --> 42:47.356

for Sam Morril, y'all.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.783
All right, now,
this next comic describes

42:57.867 --> 42:59.993
himself as
a lifelong Gotham resident

43:00.161 --> 43:02.537
who from a young age
was always told

43:02.622 --> 43:03.664
that his purpose in life

43:03.831 --> 43:07.834
was to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.

43:08.419 --> 43:09.779
- Um... Okay.

"You should enjoy it.

work for a living."

"No, I won't, Ma,

44:48.686 --> 44:49.853
Um...

44:52.065 --> 44:53.190
Here's one.

44:54.609 --> 44:57.527
You know, I was
just thinking the other day,

44:57.612 --> 44:59.571
- why are the rich people...

That's the time you must keep on trying

46:04.720 --> 46:08.890
Smile, what's the use of crying

46:09.058 --> 46:13.520
You'll find that
Life is still worthwhile

46:13.938 --> 46:15.230
[laughing]

46:15.773 --> 46:19.651
If you just smile

46:21.946 --> 46:23.488

46:27.160 --> 46:28.595
[Murray on TV]
And, buddy, as always,

46:28.619 --> 46:29.744
thanks for the laughs.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.413
I'm sure we'll see you again.

46:31.581 --> 46:32.789
You know we'll be here, right?

46:32.874 --> 46:34.166
- I hope.
- [audience laughing]

46:34.250 --> 46:37.919
Tomorrow night, we have
Diana Hudson, Greg Gordon,

46:38.087 --> 46:40.881
and animal expert, Hugh Little.

46:41.549 --> 46:42.841
Thanks for watching.

46:43.009 --> 46:45.302
Good night, and always remember,

46:45.470 --> 46:46.947
- that's life.

46:51.184 --> 46:52.350
[softly] That's life.

46:57.190 --> 47:00.567
Momma, time to wake up
and go to bed.

47:00.651 --> 47:01.776
- Hmm? Oh...
- [grunting]

47:04.030 --> 47:05.489
Oh, Happy.

47:08.326 --> 47:09.993
Happy, I wrote a new letter.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.870
Come on, dance with me.

47:12.872 --> 47:15.248
[Penny] For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.

47:15.333 --> 47:16.333
[Arthur whistles]

[Penny chuckles]

47:22.089 --> 47:23.548
[Arthur humming]

47:24.175 --> 47:25.884
You smell like cologne.

47:26.052 --> 47:28.512
It's 'cause
I just had a big date.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.472
[chuckles] Oh.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.935
Just don't forget to mail it.

[music ends]

49:08.529 --> 49:11.114
You're gonna kill me. You're
gonna give me a heart attack!

49:11.282 --> 49:12.449
Don't give me your...

49:12.617 --> 49:14.451
- [pounding on door]
- [Penny] No. No.

49:14.619 --> 49:17.579
I'm not talking to you
until you stop being angry!

49:17.747 --> 49:20.165
Okay.

49:24.879 --> 49:27.005
I'm not angry, Mom.

49:27.173 --> 49:29.507
I'm not angry.

49:29.675 --> 49:30.884
Please.

49:31.927 --> 49:34.679
Mom, is this real?

49:38.351 --> 49:41.561
He's an extraordinary man,
Happy.

49:41.729 --> 49:44.064
He's a very powerful man.

49:45.608 --> 49:47.567
We were in love.

49:48.444 --> 49:50.362
He said it was best that
we not be together

49:50.446 --> 49:52.572
because of appearances.

49:55.034 --> 49:58.411
And I could never
tell anyone because...

50:00.956 --> 50:02.415
Well, I signed some papers.

50:04.251 --> 50:05.877
And besides, you can imagine

50:05.961 --> 50:09.339
what people would say
about Thomas and me.

50:12.051 --> 50:13.426
What they'd say about you.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.557
What would they say, Mom?

52:39.365 --> 52:40.573
[Arthur singing]

52:52.795 --> 52:53.837
Hi.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.174
What's your name?

52:59.426 --> 53:01.052
I'm Bruce.

53:02.137 --> 53:03.304
Bruce.

53:05.266 --> 53:06.516
I'm Arthur.

53:28.497 --> 53:29.873
That's better.

53:30.791 --> 53:32.375
[Alfred] Bruce! Bruce!

53:33.878 --> 53:35.044
Get away from that man.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.338
It's okay. I'm a good guy.

53:37.506 --> 53:38.756
What are you doing?
Who are you?

53:39.383 --> 53:41.050
I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.720
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.449
Why did you give him
these flowers?

53:46.473 --> 53:47.682
[Arthur] No, they're not real.

53:49.435 --> 53:51.477
It's magic.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.354
I was just trying to
make him smile.

53:53.522 --> 53:55.356
Well, it's not funny, is it?

53:56.358 --> 53:57.567
Do I need to call the police?

53:57.735 --> 53:59.152
[Arthur] No. Please.

54:00.446 --> 54:03.656
My mother's name is Penny.
Penny Fleck.

54:03.824 --> 54:05.051
She used to work here years ago.

54:05.075 --> 54:07.160
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

54:08.329 --> 54:09.787
You are her son.

54:09.955 --> 54:10.955
[Arthur] Yeah.

54:11.624 --> 54:13.333
Did you know her?

54:16.962 --> 54:19.297
[whispers]
I know about the two of them.

54:19.882 --> 54:22.300
She told me everything.

54:24.178 --> 54:25.970
[whispers]
There's nothing to know.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.890
There is no "them."

54:29.850 --> 54:32.018
Your mother was delusional.

54:32.937 --> 54:34.020
She was a sick woman.

54:34.188 --> 54:36.230
Don't say that.

54:37.399 --> 54:38.816
Just go.

54:38.943 --> 54:39.943
Mmm?

54:40.069 --> 54:42.320
Before you
make a fool of yourself.

54:43.989 --> 54:46.658
Thomas Wayne is my father.

54:46.742 --> 54:47.742
[Alfred laughing]

54:49.536 --> 54:50.954
[Alfred yelping]

54:51.705 --> 54:52.705
He left me.

54:53.123 --> 54:54.332
[Alfred choking]

54:55.542 --> 54:56.902
- Let go! Let go!
- [Arthur grunts]

54:58.128 --> 54:59.754
[Alfred continues choking]

55:06.428 --> 55:07.762
[panting]

55:23.195 --> 55:25.029
Keep the respirations above 15.

55:25.197 --> 55:27.365
Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.

55:28.617 --> 55:29.826
Mom?

55:30.661 --> 55:31.661
What happened?

55:31.829 --> 55:33.496
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

55:33.580 --> 55:35.141
- What happened?
- You can probably help us out inside.

55:35.165 --> 55:36.582
We don't know what happened yet.

55:36.667 --> 55:38.645
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- [paramedic 2] Step.

55:38.669 --> 55:39.980
[paramedic 1 ] One more.
We got one more lift.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.045
[paramedic 2] I'm getting

55:41.130 --> 55:42.357
a little resistance here,
Michael.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.966
[paramedics chattering
indistinctly]

55:45.050 --> 55:46.050
[paramedic 1 ] Lift.

55:51.598 --> 55:52.932
[Arthur] I'm right here.

55:53.308 --> 55:54.517
Excuse me, sir.

55:54.768 --> 55:55.870
Does your mother take
any medications?

55:55.894 --> 55:56.978
- No.
- Excuse me,

55:57.062 --> 55:58.142
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

55:58.188 --> 55:59.833
Sir, when was the last time
you spoke to her?

55:59.857 --> 56:01.024
I don't know.

56:02.526 --> 56:03.943
[siren wailing]

56:45.944 --> 56:47.153
[Garrity] Mr. Fleck.

56:48.530 --> 56:50.490
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

56:50.574 --> 56:52.867
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

56:53.285 --> 56:55.953
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

56:57.456 --> 56:58.956
so we spoke with your mother.

57:00.709 --> 57:01.709
Oh.

57:02.878 --> 57:04.295
What did you say to her?

57:04.463 --> 57:05.463
Did you do this?

57:05.631 --> 57:06.631
What? No.

57:06.799 --> 57:09.258
No, no, no. We just
asked her some questions,

57:09.426 --> 57:10.927
and she got hysterical.

57:11.095 --> 57:12.845
Hyperventilating,

57:13.013 --> 57:14.282
collapsed and
hit her head pretty hard.

57:14.306 --> 57:16.432
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

57:17.059 --> 57:18.893
We're sorry to hear about that.

57:19.770 --> 57:22.605
But, like I said, I still have
some questions for you.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.053
They're about
the subway killings

57:24.108 --> 57:25.149
that happened last week.

57:25.317 --> 57:26.609
You've heard about them, right?

57:26.777 --> 57:27.860
Yeah.

57:28.028 --> 57:29.028
It's horrible.

57:29.196 --> 57:30.404
Right.

57:31.365 --> 57:34.492
So, we spoke with your boss
over at Haha's.

57:34.660 --> 57:36.702
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

57:36.787 --> 57:38.246
into the children's hospital.

57:39.748 --> 57:41.749
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

57:41.917 --> 57:43.459
It's part of my act.

57:43.877 --> 57:45.211
I'm a party clown.

57:45.379 --> 57:47.296
All right.
So, why were you fired?

57:48.590 --> 57:49.757
[sighs heavily]

57:50.592 --> 57:53.136
They said I wasn't funny enough.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.263
Can you imagine that?

57:55.430 --> 57:59.267
If you don't mind, I have to
go take care of my mother.

57:59.434 --> 58:01.686
[Burke] Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

58:03.897 --> 58:06.232
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

58:06.984 --> 58:08.317
is it real,

58:08.485 --> 58:10.319
or some sort of clown thing?

58:10.863 --> 58:13.364
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

58:13.782 --> 58:16.075
I mean, is it part of your act?

58:18.662 --> 58:19.996
What do you think?

58:25.919 --> 58:27.003
[Burke] It's exit only.

58:51.486 --> 58:53.487
She's gonna be okay.

58:57.951 --> 58:59.660
I'm gonna get a coffee.

59:00.370 --> 59:01.370
You want one?

59:01.538 --> 59:02.538
Yeah.

59:13.508 --> 59:15.051
[audience laughing on TV]

59:15.677 --> 59:18.638
[Murray] So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,

59:18.805 --> 59:21.265
you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.

59:22.100 --> 59:23.601
I told him, "The garbage strike

59:23.685 --> 59:24.936
is still going on, Billy."

59:25.145 --> 59:27.188
And he says, and I'm
not kidding, Billy says,

59:27.356 --> 59:29.316
"So, where are we gonna get
all our garbage from?"

59:29.524 --> 59:31.067
- [laughs]
- [audience laughing]

59:31.735 --> 59:33.152
[audience applauding]

59:36.698 --> 59:39.158
And finally,
in a world where everyone

59:39.243 --> 59:40.576
thinks they could do my job,

59:40.744 --> 59:42.954
we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,

59:43.038 --> 59:44.163
right here in Gotham.

59:44.331 --> 59:46.291
Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,

59:46.416 --> 59:48.125
it'll somehow make you funny.

59:48.210 --> 59:49.543
Check out this joker.

59:51.838 --> 59:53.339
[laughing]

59:55.300 --> 59:56.342
Oh, my God.

59:56.426 --> 59:59.971
[Arthur on TV]
I hated school as a kid.

1:00:00.847 --> 1:00:03.891
But my mother would always say,

1:00:04.059 --> 1:00:05.643
[imitates Penny]
"You should enjoy it.

1:00:05.727 --> 1:00:07.853
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

1:00:08.647 --> 1:00:10.064
[normal voice]
"No, I won't, Ma.

1:00:10.148 --> 1:00:11.857
I'm gonna be a comedian."

1:00:11.942 --> 1:00:14.610
- [laughing]
- [Arthur laughing on TV]

1:00:18.198 --> 1:00:20.283
[laughs] You shoulda listened
to your mother.

1:00:20.367 --> 1:00:22.368
[audience laughing
and applauding]

1:00:22.536 --> 1:00:24.120
Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.

1:00:24.288 --> 1:00:26.706
All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.

1:00:27.541 --> 1:00:28.541
[Arthur] It's funny,

1:00:29.418 --> 1:00:31.544
when I was a little boy

1:00:31.712 --> 1:00:34.547
and told people
I was gonna be a comedian,

1:00:34.715 --> 1:00:36.757
everyone laughed at me.

1:00:36.925 --> 1:00:39.719
Well, no one's laughing now.

1:00:40.971 --> 1:00:42.221
[audience laughing]

1:00:43.223 --> 1:00:45.099
You can say that again, pal.

1:00:45.267 --> 1:00:46.684
[audience applauding]

1:00:50.897 --> 1:00:53.733
All right, we got a great show
for you tonight.

1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:57.069
Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,

1:00:57.237 --> 1:01:01.073
and new music from
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.

1:01:07.039 --> 1:01:09.582
[news anchor] As tensions mount
around the metro area,

1:01:09.750 --> 1:01:13.336
Mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.

1:01:13.503 --> 1:01:15.087
City services
have been affected,

1:01:15.255 --> 1:01:17.256
and some businesses have decided

1:01:17.341 --> 1:01:20.134
to remain closed
amid the unrest.

1:01:20.302 --> 1:01:22.887
Chuck Stevens filed this report.

1:01:23.055 --> 1:01:24.282
[Chuck]
The anger and resentment

1:01:24.306 --> 1:01:25.742
that's been building
in the city for weeks

1:01:25.766 --> 1:01:27.767
seems close to exploding.

1:01:27.934 --> 1:01:29.977
Protesters,
many dressed as clowns,

1:01:30.062 --> 1:01:31.187
took to the streets today

1:01:31.396 --> 1:01:33.189
in one of
several planned demonstrations

1:01:33.273 --> 1:01:34.815
taking on the city's elite,

1:01:34.983 --> 1:01:36.734
including a massive rally
outside

1:01:36.818 --> 1:01:39.236
tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne Hall.

1:01:39.404 --> 1:01:41.049
[reporter 1 ]
What's the point of all this?

1:01:41.073 --> 1:01:42.907
[bleep] the rich.
[bleep] Thomas Wayne.

1:01:42.991 --> 1:01:44.677
That's what this whole [bleep]
thing is about.

1:01:44.701 --> 1:01:46.577
[bleep] the whole system.

1:01:46.745 --> 1:01:47.889
[Chuck] Wayne,
who recently announced

1:01:47.913 --> 1:01:49.121
he is running for mayor,

1:01:49.289 --> 1:01:50.998
will be attending the benefit.

1:01:51.166 --> 1:01:53.167
You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne

1:01:53.335 --> 1:01:54.710
who first referred to

1:01:54.795 --> 1:01:57.588
many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."

1:01:57.756 --> 1:02:00.758
Today, he offered little in
the way of an apology.

1:02:00.926 --> 1:02:02.176
Well, what I will say is,

1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:03.529
there's something wrong
with those people.

1:02:03.553 --> 1:02:04.553
I am here to help them.

1:02:04.721 --> 1:02:06.074
I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,

1:02:06.098 --> 1:02:07.515
help make their lives better.

1:02:07.682 --> 1:02:08.849
That is why I'm running.

1:02:09.017 --> 1:02:11.769
And they may not realize it,
but I'm their only hope.

1:02:11.895 --> 1:02:13.479
[protesters shouting]

1:02:27.577 --> 1:02:30.287
[protesters] Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

1:02:30.372 --> 1:02:33.124
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

1:02:35.377 --> 1:02:37.086
[shouting continues]

1:02:45.137 --> 1:02:46.512
[policemen shouting]

1:03:09.244 --> 1:03:10.744
[lively music playing in cinema]

1:03:20.964 --> 1:03:23.424
- [indistinct chattering]
- [audience laughing]

1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:35.186
[audience continues laughing]

1:03:51.745 --> 1:03:53.746
- [music continues]
- [audience laughing]

1:03:59.878 --> 1:04:01.170
[laughing]

1:04:41.419 --> 1:04:42.753
[door opens]

1:05:07.904 --> 1:05:09.029
[door closes]

1:05:13.702 --> 1:05:14.785
Can I help you, pal?

1:05:17.038 --> 1:05:18.706
I don't know what to say.

1:05:18.999 --> 1:05:20.207
[flushing]

1:05:20.709 --> 1:05:21.709
[Thomas chuckles]

1:05:22.335 --> 1:05:24.545
Do you want an autograph
or something?

1:05:24.713 --> 1:05:25.713
No.

1:05:31.845 --> 1:05:33.387
My name is Arthur.

1:05:34.973 --> 1:05:36.599
Penny Fleck is my mother.

1:05:37.976 --> 1:05:38.976
Jesus.

1:05:40.061 --> 1:05:41.901
You're the guy that came to
my house yesterday.

1:05:43.315 --> 1:05:44.565
- Yes.
- [Thomas laughs]

1:05:45.108 --> 1:05:46.984
I'm sorry I just showed up.

1:05:47.152 --> 1:05:48.611
But my mother
told me everything,

1:05:48.695 --> 1:05:50.362
and I had to talk to you.

1:05:50.530 --> 1:05:52.448
Look, pal, I'm not your father.

1:05:53.074 --> 1:05:54.533
[chuckling]
What's wrong with you?

1:05:56.202 --> 1:05:57.745
Look at us.

1:05:59.247 --> 1:06:00.497
I think you are.

1:06:00.665 --> 1:06:01.874
Well, that's impossible

1:06:02.459 --> 1:06:03.709
because you're adopted,

1:06:03.793 --> 1:06:05.021
and I never slept with
your mother.

1:06:05.045 --> 1:06:06.647
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

1:06:06.671 --> 1:06:08.047
- Money?
- No, I don't...

1:06:08.131 --> 1:06:09.256
I wasn't adopted.

1:06:09.424 --> 1:06:11.216
Jesus. She never told you?

1:06:11.384 --> 1:06:13.052
Told me what?

1:06:13.178 --> 1:06:14.303
[sighs]

1:06:14.387 --> 1:06:16.365
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

1:06:16.389 --> 1:06:17.598
That's not true.

1:06:18.141 --> 1:06:19.141
Why are you saying that?

1:06:19.309 --> 1:06:20.369
Then she was arrested
and committed

1:06:20.393 --> 1:06:21.560
to Arkham State Hospital,

1:06:21.728 --> 1:06:23.103
when you were just a little boy.

1:06:23.271 --> 1:06:24.396
Why are you saying this?

1:06:24.564 --> 1:06:26.065
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

1:06:26.232 --> 1:06:27.566
I know it seems strange.

1:06:27.651 --> 1:06:29.276
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

1:06:29.444 --> 1:06:31.028
I don't know
why everyone is so rude.

1:06:31.196 --> 1:06:32.404
I don't know why you are.

1:06:32.572 --> 1:06:33.906
I don't want anything from you.

1:06:34.074 --> 1:06:36.450
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug, Dad!

1:06:36.618 --> 1:06:38.619
How about just a little bit
of fucking decency?

1:06:38.787 --> 1:06:40.162
What is it with you people?

1:06:40.330 --> 1:06:42.289
You say that stuff
about my mother.

1:06:42.457 --> 1:06:43.832
She's crazy.

1:06:43.917 --> 1:06:46.001
She's... [laughing]

1:06:53.593 --> 1:06:54.968
You think this is funny?

1:06:56.596 --> 1:06:59.765
Dad, it's me. Come on.

1:07:01.393 --> 1:07:02.393
[groans]

1:07:02.477 --> 1:07:03.644
[Thomas] Touch my son again,

1:07:03.728 --> 1:07:05.168
- I'll fucking kill you.
- [laughing]

1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:11.860
[door closes]

1:07:11.945 --> 1:07:13.320
[phone ringing]

1:07:13.446 --> 1:07:14.863
[Arthur laughing softly]

1:07:23.331 --> 1:07:24.540
[answering machine beeps]

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:27.835
Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is Detective Garrity.

1:07:28.002 --> 1:07:30.337
We met the other night
at Gotham General.

1:07:30.505 --> 1:07:32.798
My partner and I had a few
more questions for you.

1:07:32.966 --> 1:07:35.884
We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.

1:07:36.052 --> 1:07:37.932
Please give me a call
when you get this message.

1:07:37.971 --> 1:07:39.888
Again, Detective Garrity,

1:07:40.056 --> 1:07:44.059
and my number is 212... 99.

1:07:45.395 --> 1:07:46.395
[answering machine beeps]

1:08:13.798 --> 1:08:15.716
[phone ringing]

1:08:25.435 --> 1:08:26.560
[answering machine beeps]

1:08:27.103 --> 1:08:28.937
[Shirley] This message is
for Arthur Fleck.

1:08:29.105 --> 1:08:30.814
My name is Shirley Woods.

1:08:30.899 --> 1:08:33.066
I work on
The Murray Franklin Show.

1:08:33.234 --> 1:08:34.378
I don't know if you're aware,

1:08:34.402 --> 1:08:36.002
but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up

1:08:36.029 --> 1:08:37.070
on the show recently,

1:08:37.238 --> 1:08:40.532
and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.

1:08:40.700 --> 1:08:42.910
Murray asked me to give you
a call and see if you're...

1:08:47.332 --> 1:08:48.665
Who is this?

1:08:48.833 --> 1:08:50.459
Oh, hi, this is Shirley Woods.

1:08:50.627 --> 1:08:53.420
I'm the show Booker from
Live with Murray Franklin.

1:08:53.588 --> 1:08:54.630
Is this Arthur?

1:08:56.633 --> 1:08:57.633
Yes.

1:08:57.801 --> 1:08:59.760
Hi, Arthur.
Well, as I was saying,

1:08:59.844 --> 1:09:01.845
we've gotten a lot of calls
about your clip.

1:09:02.013 --> 1:09:03.722
Amazing responses.

1:09:03.890 --> 1:09:06.183
And Murray asked
if I would reach out to you

1:09:06.267 --> 1:09:07.893
to see if you would
come on as his guest.

1:09:13.191 --> 1:09:16.318
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?

1:09:16.486 --> 1:09:18.070
Yeah. Isn't that great?

1:09:18.238 --> 1:09:21.114
He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?

1:09:22.116 --> 1:09:24.284
That sound good to you?

1:09:28.623 --> 1:09:30.666
Yeah, that sounds great.

1:09:30.834 --> 1:09:32.668
Can we set up a date right now?

1:09:32.752 --> 1:09:34.461
Are you available next Thursday?

1:10:07.453 --> 1:10:08.787
[inaudible]

1:10:16.337 --> 1:10:18.171
[indistinct announcement on PA]

1:10:27.181 --> 1:10:28.181
[clerk] Hey.

1:10:29.017 --> 1:10:31.977
[sighs] Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

1:10:32.145 --> 1:10:34.415
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

1:10:34.439 --> 1:10:37.441
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

1:10:38.818 --> 1:10:40.777
Can I ask you a question?

1:10:40.945 --> 1:10:42.154
Sure.

1:10:42.739 --> 1:10:46.658
How does someone
wind up in here?

1:10:47.744 --> 1:10:51.246
Have they all, all the people
committed crimes?

1:10:51.873 --> 1:10:53.540
Well, yeah, some have.

1:10:53.708 --> 1:10:56.585
You know, some are just crazy.

1:10:56.753 --> 1:10:59.212
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:00.964
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

1:11:01.049 --> 1:11:03.133
Don't know what to do, you know?

1:11:03.301 --> 1:11:06.970
- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

1:11:07.055 --> 1:11:09.890
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

1:11:11.434 --> 1:11:14.102
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

1:11:15.563 --> 1:11:19.191
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.

1:11:20.526 --> 1:11:21.526
What's that?

1:11:23.071 --> 1:11:26.448
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

1:11:26.532 --> 1:11:27.532
[chuckles]

1:11:30.370 --> 1:11:31.555
You know what I'm talking about,

1:11:31.579 --> 1:11:36.917
it's so hard to just try and
be happy all the time.

1:11:39.003 --> 1:11:40.712
Hey, listen, man.

1:11:41.714 --> 1:11:43.173
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

1:11:43.257 --> 1:11:44.758
Like a clerk, you know.

1:11:44.926 --> 1:11:46.510
All I do is file paperwork.

1:11:47.637 --> 1:11:49.346
I don't know what to tell you.

1:11:49.514 --> 1:11:51.306
But you should see somebody.

1:11:51.474 --> 1:11:52.724
You know, they got programs,

1:11:52.809 --> 1:11:55.352
city services, stuff like that.

1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:56.853
Oh, yeah.

1:11:56.938 --> 1:11:58.618
[in high-pitched voice]
They cut all those.

1:11:59.232 --> 1:12:00.649
[clerk laughs]

1:12:03.611 --> 1:12:05.612
All right, here it is.
Fleck.

1:12:05.780 --> 1:12:07.698
Penny Fleck. Let's see.

1:12:08.616 --> 1:12:12.202
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

1:12:13.746 --> 1:12:17.791
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

1:12:17.959 --> 1:12:21.420
and narcissistic
personality disorder." Mmm.

1:12:22.005 --> 1:12:23.714
"Was found guilty of endangering

1:12:23.798 --> 1:12:27.217
the welfare
of her own child."

1:12:35.518 --> 1:12:36.518
What?

1:12:39.939 --> 1:12:41.398
You said she's your mother.

1:12:46.362 --> 1:12:47.487
Uh...

1:12:47.697 --> 1:12:50.073
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

1:12:50.241 --> 1:12:52.993
you know, without proper forms.

1:12:53.453 --> 1:12:55.120
I could get in trouble.

1:12:55.913 --> 1:12:57.956
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

1:12:58.124 --> 1:12:59.124
that'll be much easier,

1:12:59.292 --> 1:13:02.335
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

1:13:02.503 --> 1:13:03.503
I'm sorry.

1:13:07.675 --> 1:13:09.885
No, man! Shit!

1:13:10.470 --> 1:13:12.345
Come on, man. Give it...

1:13:13.264 --> 1:13:15.557
Hey! Hey!

1:13:27.570 --> 1:13:29.154
[panting]

1:13:49.926 --> 1:13:50.926
[door closes]

1:14:13.741 --> 1:14:16.660
[Stoner] We went over this,
Penny. You adopted him.

1:14:17.370 --> 1:14:19.162
We have all the paperwork
right here.

1:14:19.872 --> 1:14:22.082
[Young Penny] That's not true.

1:14:22.250 --> 1:14:24.501
Thomas had that all made up,

1:14:24.669 --> 1:14:27.295
so it stayed our secret.

1:14:27.713 --> 1:14:28.755
[gasps]

1:14:29.215 --> 1:14:31.633
[Stoner] You also stood by

1:14:32.260 --> 1:14:33.593
while one of your boyfriends

1:14:33.678 --> 1:14:37.139
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

1:14:38.516 --> 1:14:39.516
and battered you.

1:14:44.355 --> 1:14:45.647
[laughing]

1:14:59.287 --> 1:15:00.871
Penny,

1:15:01.455 --> 1:15:05.083
your son was found tied
to a radiator

1:15:05.251 --> 1:15:07.669
in your filthy apartment.

1:15:07.837 --> 1:15:10.338
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

1:15:10.506 --> 1:15:12.507
and severe trauma to his head.

1:15:12.592 --> 1:15:14.593
[Arthur laughing]

1:15:14.677 --> 1:15:16.386
[Young Penny]
I never heard him cry.

1:15:17.305 --> 1:15:20.765
He's always been
such a happy little boy.

1:15:21.642 --> 1:15:23.143
[laughing tearfully]

1:15:36.407 --> 1:15:38.200

- [Sophie shushing]

1:17:21.846 --> 1:17:23.263
[Sophie] It's time for bed.

1:17:24.515 --> 1:17:25.515
[door closes]

1:17:26.767 --> 1:17:27.767
[gasps] Oh, my God!

1:17:28.728 --> 1:17:30.688
- What are you doing in here?
- [thunder rumbling]

1:17:32.940 --> 1:17:34.816
You're in the wrong apartment.

1:17:41.449 --> 1:17:43.158
Your name's Arthur, right?

1:17:43.784 --> 1:17:44.993
You live down the hall.

1:17:48.205 --> 1:17:49.998
I really need you to leave.

1:17:54.295 --> 1:17:57.255
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

1:18:02.386 --> 1:18:03.470
Please.

1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:08.391
I had a bad day.

1:18:11.228 --> 1:18:13.730
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

1:18:33.918 --> 1:18:34.918
[gasps]

1:18:36.712 --> 1:18:37.796
[chuckling]

1:19:31.350 --> 1:19:33.309
[continues laughing]

1:19:39.984 --> 1:19:41.693
- [banging on wall]
- [man] Shut up!

1:19:41.986 --> 1:19:44.112
[continues laughing]

1:19:49.952 --> 1:19:52.328
[heart monitor beeping]

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:02.297
Hey, Penny.

1:20:04.758 --> 1:20:06.092
Penny Fleck.

1:20:14.268 --> 1:20:16.102
I always hated that name.

1:20:19.732 --> 1:20:21.649
You know how you used to tell me

1:20:23.694 --> 1:20:26.321
that my laugh was a condition?

1:20:27.865 --> 1:20:29.949
That there was
something wrong with me?

1:20:33.037 --> 1:20:34.245
There isn't.

1:20:37.124 --> 1:20:38.458
That's the real me.

1:20:39.293 --> 1:20:40.793
[Penny, weakly] Happy.

1:20:43.005 --> 1:20:45.465
Happy. Hmm.

1:20:48.802 --> 1:20:51.596
I haven't been happy

1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:53.932
one minute of
my entire fucking life.

1:21:00.898 --> 1:21:02.315
You know what's funny?

1:21:05.069 --> 1:21:06.861
You know
what really makes me laugh?

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:11.658
I used to think
that my life was a tragedy...

1:21:12.326 --> 1:21:13.326
[grunts]

1:21:13.410 --> 1:21:15.411
But now I realize

1:21:15.579 --> 1:21:17.163
it's a fucking comedy.

1:21:18.207 --> 1:21:19.457

1:22:29.028 --> 1:22:32.030
He's got a new movie
called American Playboy

1:22:32.197 --> 1:22:34.073

1:22:34.241 --> 1:22:36.075

Hey, Murray.
Thanks so much for having...

1:23:06.899 --> 1:23:07.940
Hey, Murray.

Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

1:23:10.694 --> 1:23:12.820
It's been
a lifelong dream of mine.

1:23:15.115 --> 1:23:16.355
[Murray] I'm nervous right now.

1:23:16.533 --> 1:23:17.825
[audience laughing on video]

1:23:18.118 --> 1:23:19.798

1:23:35.344 --> 1:23:36.803
I'm sorry. What's that?

1:23:38.180 --> 1:23:39.972
Oh, that's very funny, Murray.

1:23:41.266 --> 1:23:43.434
You know, I'm also a comedian.

1:23:43.602 --> 1:23:44.894
Would you like to hear a joke?

1:23:44.978 --> 1:23:46.020

1:23:46.105 --> 1:23:48.314
Yeah? All of you?

Okay.

1:24:32.526 --> 1:24:34.235
[chorus] That's life

1:24:34.319 --> 1:24:37.238
[man] That's what all the people say

1:24:38.657 --> 1:24:41.534
You're riding high in April

1:24:41.618 --> 1:24:44.287
Shot down in May

1:24:44.371 --> 1:24:49.041
But I know I'm gonna change that tune

1:24:50.586 --> 1:24:55.214
When I'm back on top
Back on top in June

1:24:55.799 --> 1:24:58.217
I said, that's life

Stompin' on a dream

1:25:10.814 --> 1:25:14.567
But I don't let it,
let it get me down

1:25:16.361 --> 1:25:18.696
'Cause this fine old world

1:25:18.781 --> 1:25:21.282
It keeps spinnin' around

1:25:22.117 --> 1:25:25.369
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

1:25:25.454 --> 1:25:28.956
A poet, a pawn and a king

1:25:29.041 --> 1:25:33.085
I've been up and down and over and out

1:25:33.170 --> 1:25:35.296
And I know one thing

1:25:35.380 --> 1:25:41.010
Each time I find myself flat on my face

1:25:42.012 --> 1:25:48.184
I pick myself up
And get back in the race

[man] I tell ya, I can't deny it

1:25:55.692 --> 1:25:57.568
I thought of quitting, baby

1:25:58.821 --> 1:26:01.364
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it

1:26:01.448 --> 1:26:04.909
And if I didn't think
It was worth one single try

1:26:04.993 --> 1:26:06.327
[doorbell buzzing insistently]

1:26:07.663 --> 1:26:08.746
Coming.

1:26:08.831 --> 1:26:12.375
I'd jump right on a big bird
And then I'd fly...

1:26:19.842 --> 1:26:21.259
[Gary] Hey, Arthur.

1:26:21.426 --> 1:26:22.426
How's it going?

1:26:23.428 --> 1:26:24.720
Oh, hey, guys.

1:26:25.264 --> 1:26:26.389
Come on in.

1:26:26.849 --> 1:26:27.974
Did you get a new gig?

1:26:28.684 --> 1:26:29.684
No.

1:26:30.602 --> 1:26:33.646
Oh, you must be going down to
that rally at City Hall.

1:26:33.814 --> 1:26:35.481
I hear it's gonna be nuts.

1:26:35.649 --> 1:26:37.233
Oh, is that today?

1:26:37.943 --> 1:26:38.943
Yeah.

1:26:39.862 --> 1:26:41.279
What's with the makeup then?

1:26:42.739 --> 1:26:44.240
My mom died.

1:26:44.408 --> 1:26:45.616
I'm celebrating.

1:26:46.535 --> 1:26:47.535
Right. We heard.

1:26:47.703 --> 1:26:48.744
That's why we came by.

1:26:48.912 --> 1:26:51.622
We figured, you know, you
could use some cheering up.

1:26:52.165 --> 1:26:53.791
[Arthur] Aw, that's sweet.

1:26:53.959 --> 1:26:56.836
But, no, I feel good.

1:26:57.629 --> 1:26:59.255
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

1:26:59.423 --> 1:27:01.048
I feel a lot better now.

1:27:03.176 --> 1:27:05.678
Oh, okay. Good for you.

1:27:07.806 --> 1:27:10.683
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

1:27:10.851 --> 1:27:13.269
but the cops have been coming
around the shop,

1:27:14.021 --> 1:27:17.940
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

1:27:18.066 --> 1:27:19.859
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

1:27:21.820 --> 1:27:24.488
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

1:27:25.032 --> 1:27:27.533
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

1:27:28.577 --> 1:27:30.077
[Arthur laughing]

1:27:33.332 --> 1:27:34.582
Anyway, um,

1:27:34.750 --> 1:27:38.753
Hoyt said
that they talked to you,

1:27:38.921 --> 1:27:40.212
and now they're looking for me,

1:27:40.297 --> 1:27:41.881
and I just wanna know
what you said.

1:27:42.049 --> 1:27:43.466
Make sure our stories line up.

1:27:43.634 --> 1:27:46.677
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

1:27:46.845 --> 1:27:48.656
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:50.348
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

What the fuck, Arthur?

1:28:54.913 --> 1:28:55.997
[normal voice] What?

1:29:01.003 --> 1:29:02.211
It's okay, Gary.

1:29:02.671 --> 1:29:03.671
You can go.

1:29:03.922 --> 1:29:04.922
[Gary groaning]

1:29:06.258 --> 1:29:07.883
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:29:10.846 --> 1:29:12.304
Oh!

1:29:12.556 --> 1:29:14.640
Don't look. Just go.

Shit.

Gary?

1:29:57.768 --> 1:29:58.768
Yeah.

Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

1:35:24.552 --> 1:35:25.761
Thank you, Murray.

1:35:26.971 --> 1:35:28.722
I feel like I know you.

1:35:29.224 --> 1:35:31.058
I've been watching you forever.

1:35:31.226 --> 1:35:32.351
Thank you.

1:35:32.519 --> 1:35:33.811
What's with the face?

1:35:33.978 --> 1:35:35.938
I mean,
are you part of the protest?

1:35:36.106 --> 1:35:37.106
No.

1:35:37.273 --> 1:35:39.024
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

1:35:39.734 --> 1:35:41.318
I don't believe in anything.

1:35:41.945 --> 1:35:43.487
I just thought
it'd be good for my act.

1:35:43.655 --> 1:35:45.155
For your act? Didn't you hear

1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:46.717
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

1:35:46.741 --> 1:35:48.427
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

1:35:48.451 --> 1:35:49.701
No, I hadn't heard.

1:35:50.161 --> 1:35:51.245
- Yeah.
- You see?

1:35:51.329 --> 1:35:52.723
This is what I'm telling you.
The audience is gonna go crazy

1:35:52.747 --> 1:35:53.747
if you put this guy on.

1:35:53.873 --> 1:35:55.999
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

1:35:56.167 --> 1:35:58.377
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

1:35:59.170 --> 1:36:01.250
- We're gonna go with it.
- [Arthur and Murray laugh]

1:36:01.506 --> 1:36:02.506
Thank you, Murray.

1:36:03.091 --> 1:36:04.216
Couple rules, though.

1:36:04.384 --> 1:36:06.135
No cursing.
No off-color material.

1:36:06.302 --> 1:36:07.761
We do a clean show.

1:36:07.929 --> 1:36:08.929
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:36:09.097 --> 1:36:10.681
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

1:36:10.849 --> 1:36:11.849
I love Dr. Sally.

1:36:12.016 --> 1:36:13.434
Good, good. Someone will

1:36:13.518 --> 1:36:15.686
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.

1:36:15.770 --> 1:36:16.895
Good luck.

1:36:16.980 --> 1:36:17.980
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

1:36:19.190 --> 1:36:22.401
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.

1:36:22.569 --> 1:36:24.236
When you bring me out,

1:36:24.404 --> 1:36:26.280
can you introduce me as Joker?

1:36:26.448 --> 1:36:28.157
What's wrong
with your real name?

1:36:28.783 --> 1:36:31.034
That's what you called me
on the show.

1:36:31.202 --> 1:36:32.327
A joker.

1:36:32.495 --> 1:36:33.495
Do you remember?

1:36:33.872 --> 1:36:35.873
- Did I?
- [Gene] I don't know.

1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:38.125
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.

1:36:38.293 --> 1:36:39.293
It's good.

1:36:39.461 --> 1:36:40.544
Thanks, Murray.

1:36:53.349 --> 1:36:54.558
[gun clicks]

1:37:02.817 --> 1:37:03.919
[Murray] I'll try it, you know,

1:37:03.943 --> 1:37:05.819
but I'm not sure
my wife will let me do it.

1:37:05.904 --> 1:37:07.196
[audience laughing]

1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:08.614
Maybe my next wife.

1:37:08.865 --> 1:37:10.465
- [Murray laughing]
- [audience cheering]

1:37:12.327 --> 1:37:14.077
You gotta see
our next guest for yourself.

1:37:14.245 --> 1:37:16.288
I'm pretty sure
this guy could use a doctor.

1:37:16.623 --> 1:37:17.683
- [audience laughing]
- [Dr. Sally] Oh!

1:37:17.707 --> 1:37:19.082
Does he have sexual problems?

1:37:19.250 --> 1:37:21.668
[Murray] Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.

1:37:21.753 --> 1:37:22.794
[audience laughing]

1:37:22.879 --> 1:37:25.506
All right, Bobby, let's show
that clip one last time.

1:37:25.757 --> 1:37:27.382
[Arthur laughing on video]

1:37:31.930 --> 1:37:34.806
[Arthur]
I hated school as a kid.

1:37:36.601 --> 1:37:38.769
But my mother would always say,

1:37:39.812 --> 1:37:41.123
[imitates Penny]
"You should enjoy it.

1:37:41.147 --> 1:37:44.274
One day, you'll have to
work for a living."

1:37:44.442 --> 1:37:45.669
[normal voice]
"No, I won't, Ma.

1:37:45.693 --> 1:37:47.653
I'm gonna be a comedian."

1:37:47.737 --> 1:37:49.571
[Arthur laughing on video]

1:37:53.952 --> 1:37:56.245
- [Murray] Okay. You may...
- [audience laughing]

1:37:57.705 --> 1:38:00.958
You may have seen that clip
of our next guest.

1:38:01.125 --> 1:38:03.502
Now, before he comes out,
I just want to say

1:38:03.670 --> 1:38:05.170
that we're all heartbroken

1:38:05.255 --> 1:38:07.214
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

1:38:07.382 --> 1:38:09.675
But this is
how he wanted to come out,

1:38:09.842 --> 1:38:13.053
and honestly, I think
we could all use a good laugh.

1:38:13.221 --> 1:38:15.389
So, please welcome, Joker.

1:38:16.599 --> 1:38:18.600
- [music playing]
- [audience applauding]

1:38:30.488 --> 1:38:32.197
[audience cheering]

1:38:43.918 --> 1:38:45.419
[audience whooping
and whistling]

1:38:58.016 --> 1:38:59.391
Are you all right, Doctor?

1:38:59.475 --> 1:39:00.767
[audience laughing]

1:39:03.229 --> 1:39:05.689
Well,
that was quite an entrance.

1:39:09.777 --> 1:39:11.320
[scattered laughter
from audience]

1:39:12.238 --> 1:39:13.238
You okay?

1:39:16.075 --> 1:39:17.492
Yeah.

1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:20.370
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1:39:22.332 --> 1:39:24.124
Well, that makes one of us.

1:39:24.208 --> 1:39:25.626
[audience laughing]

1:39:25.710 --> 1:39:26.710
[audience applauding]

1:39:31.007 --> 1:39:33.175
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1:39:33.343 --> 1:39:34.676
When we spoke earlier,

1:39:34.761 --> 1:39:36.864
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

1:39:36.888 --> 1:39:37.929
Is that right?

1:39:38.097 --> 1:39:39.723
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1:39:39.891 --> 1:39:42.434
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1:39:42.602 --> 1:39:44.682
- And how's that going for you?
- [audience laughing]

1:39:45.438 --> 1:39:46.938
[laughing]

1:39:52.695 --> 1:39:54.529
So, I know you're a comedian.

1:39:54.697 --> 1:39:56.531
You been working on
any new material?

1:39:56.616 --> 1:39:57.741
You wanna tell us a joke?

1:39:58.660 --> 1:39:59.826
[audience applauding]

1:40:03.456 --> 1:40:04.456
Yeah?

1:40:06.626 --> 1:40:07.626
Okay.

1:40:11.339 --> 1:40:12.714
[audience laughing]

1:40:13.675 --> 1:40:15.300
He's got a book.

1:40:16.219 --> 1:40:17.678
A book of jokes.

1:40:27.522 --> 1:40:28.897
Take your time.
We got all night.

1:40:29.315 --> 1:40:30.816
[audience laughing]

1:40:32.568 --> 1:40:33.568
[Murray chuckles]

1:40:34.946 --> 1:40:37.239
Okay, okay. Here's one.

1:40:40.368 --> 1:40:42.869
Knock, knock.

1:40:43.037 --> 1:40:44.371
And you had to look that up?

1:40:44.706 --> 1:40:46.026
- [laughing]
- [audience laughing]

1:40:46.499 --> 1:40:47.916
[audience applauding]

1:40:51.504 --> 1:40:53.130
I want to get it right.

1:40:54.966 --> 1:40:56.508
Knock, knock.

1:40:56.676 --> 1:40:58.176
Who's there?

1:40:59.637 --> 1:41:01.054
It's the police, ma'am.

1:41:01.222 --> 1:41:03.056
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

1:41:03.224 --> 1:41:05.642
- He's dead. [laughing]
- [audience gasps]

1:41:06.185 --> 1:41:07.394
[plays sad note]

1:41:07.562 --> 1:41:09.146
- [audience booing]
- Oh, no, no, no.

1:41:09.313 --> 1:41:11.064
No, you cannot joke about that.

1:41:11.232 --> 1:41:13.191
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

1:41:13.359 --> 1:41:15.819
That's not the kind of humor
we do on this show.

1:41:16.404 --> 1:41:18.697
Okay. I'm... Yeah, I'm sorry.

1:41:18.865 --> 1:41:23.243
It's just, you know, it's been
a rough few weeks, Murray.

1:41:23.327 --> 1:41:24.745
[chuckling]

1:41:24.829 --> 1:41:26.663
Ever since

1:41:29.208 --> 1:41:31.334
I killed
those three Wall Street guys.

1:41:31.502 --> 1:41:32.669
[all gasp]

1:41:37.925 --> 1:41:39.885
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punchline.

1:41:41.387 --> 1:41:43.096
There is no punchline.

1:41:44.515 --> 1:41:46.391
- It's not a joke.
- [audience murmuring]

1:41:51.063 --> 1:41:52.147
You're serious, aren't you?

1:41:52.315 --> 1:41:53.375
You're telling us you killed

1:41:53.399 --> 1:41:54.668
those three young men
on the subway?

1:41:54.692 --> 1:41:55.692
[Arthur] Mmm-hmm.

1:41:55.860 --> 1:41:57.569
And why should we believe you?

1:41:57.737 --> 1:41:59.696
I got nothing left to lose.

1:42:01.699 --> 1:42:03.742
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1:42:05.495 --> 1:42:06.828
[laughs]

1:42:06.913 --> 1:42:09.790
My life is nothing but a comedy.

1:42:10.374 --> 1:42:12.042
[audience booing]

1:42:13.419 --> 1:42:14.521
Well, let me get this straight,

1:42:14.545 --> 1:42:16.797
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1:42:17.465 --> 1:42:18.965
I do.

1:42:19.133 --> 1:42:21.760
And I'm tired
of pretending it's not.

1:42:21.928 --> 1:42:23.804
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1:42:24.263 --> 1:42:25.972
Isn't that what they say?

1:42:26.140 --> 1:42:27.891
All of you,

1:42:28.059 --> 1:42:30.644
the system that knows so much,

1:42:30.812 --> 1:42:33.522
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1:42:33.689 --> 1:42:38.902
The same way that you decide
what's funny or not!

1:42:40.238 --> 1:42:41.238
[man] Get him off!

1:42:41.989 --> 1:42:45.659
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

1:42:45.993 --> 1:42:47.494
that you did this to
start a movement,

1:42:47.578 --> 1:42:49.579
to become a symbol?

1:42:50.206 --> 1:42:51.748
Come on, Murray.

1:42:51.916 --> 1:42:53.143
Do I look like the kind of clown

1:42:53.167 --> 1:42:54.751
that could start a movement?

1:42:54.919 --> 1:42:57.754
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1:42:57.922 --> 1:43:00.423
Everybody is awful these days.

1:43:00.591 --> 1:43:02.884
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1:43:03.052 --> 1:43:04.803
[Murray] Okay. So, that's it,
you're crazy.

1:43:04.971 --> 1:43:07.264
That's your defense
for killing three young men?

1:43:07.890 --> 1:43:09.432
No.

1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:12.936
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.

1:43:13.312 --> 1:43:14.521
[audience booing]

1:43:14.772 --> 1:43:18.191
Oh, why is everybody
so upset about these guys?

1:43:19.068 --> 1:43:20.819
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1:43:20.903 --> 1:43:22.279
you'd walk right over me!

1:43:22.446 --> 1:43:24.573
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1:43:24.740 --> 1:43:26.992
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1:43:27.076 --> 1:43:28.618
went and cried about them on TV?

1:43:28.786 --> 1:43:30.829
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1:43:30.997 --> 1:43:32.914
Yes, I do.

1:43:33.082 --> 1:43:36.501
Have you seen what it's like
out there, Murray?

1:43:36.669 --> 1:43:39.713
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1:43:39.881 --> 1:43:43.717
Everybody just yells
and screams at each other.

1:43:43.885 --> 1:43:46.052
Nobody's civil anymore.

1:43:46.220 --> 1:43:49.806
Nobody thinks what it's like
to be the other guy.

1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:53.393
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

1:43:53.477 --> 1:43:55.437
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1:43:55.605 --> 1:43:58.315
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1:43:58.524 --> 1:44:00.650
They think that
we'll just sit there

1:44:00.735 --> 1:44:03.111
and take it,
like good little boys!

1:44:03.404 --> 1:44:05.488
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1:44:05.656 --> 1:44:07.282
You finished?

1:44:07.450 --> 1:44:09.784
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1:44:09.952 --> 1:44:11.494
You sound like
you're making excuses

1:44:11.579 --> 1:44:12.996
for killing those young men.

1:44:13.164 --> 1:44:14.998
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1:44:15.082 --> 1:44:16.499
not everyone is awful.

1:44:18.794 --> 1:44:20.003
You're awful, Murray.

1:44:20.171 --> 1:44:22.047
Me? I'm awful?

1:44:22.214 --> 1:44:23.965
Oh, yeah, how am I awful?

1:44:26.135 --> 1:44:27.594
Playing my video.

1:44:29.013 --> 1:44:30.889
Inviting me on this show.

1:44:31.974 --> 1:44:34.309
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1:44:35.311 --> 1:44:37.270
You're just like
the rest of them.

1:44:37.438 --> 1:44:39.356
You don't know
the first thing about me, pal.

1:44:39.523 --> 1:44:42.108
Look what happened, because of
what you did. What it led to.

1:44:42.276 --> 1:44:43.985
There are riots out there.

1:44:44.153 --> 1:44:45.672
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

1:44:45.696 --> 1:44:46.965
- and you're laughing.
- [laughs]

1:44:46.989 --> 1:44:47.989
You're laughing.

1:44:48.157 --> 1:44:50.992
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:52.619
I know.

1:44:55.206 --> 1:44:56.446
How about another joke, Murray?

1:44:56.582 --> 1:44:58.262
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

1:44:58.376 --> 1:44:59.728
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.

1:44:59.752 --> 1:45:02.295
When you cross
a mentally-ill loner

1:45:02.463 --> 1:45:04.881
with a society that abandons him

1:45:04.966 --> 1:45:06.007
and treats him like trash?

1:45:06.175 --> 1:45:07.175
Call the police, Gene!

1:45:07.343 --> 1:45:08.779
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.

1:45:08.803 --> 1:45:10.470

But I don't let it,
let it get me down

1:54:25.984 --> 1:54:28.152
'Cause this fine old world

It keeps spinnin' around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

A poet, a pawn and a king

1:54:38.330 --> 1:54:42.291
I've been up and down and over and out

1:54:42.376 --> 1:54:44.544
And I know one thing

1:54:44.878 --> 1:54:50.716
Each time I find myself flat on my face

1:54:51.134 --> 1:54:57.181
I pick myself up
And get back in the race

But if there's nothing shakin'
Come here this July

1:55:18.161 --> 1:55:24.333
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball

1:55:24.835 --> 1:55:31.048
And die

1:56:25.937 --> 1:56:29.273
Don't you approve?

1:56:30.942 --> 1:56:34.612

Where are the clowns?

1:56:48.335 --> 1:56:52.171
Send in the clowns

1:56:53.131 --> 1:56:55.883
Just when I stopped

1:56:57.386 --> 1:57:00.554
Opening doors

Finally knowing
The one that I wanted was yours

Making my entrance again
With my usual flair

1:57:21.034 --> 1:57:25.996
Sure of my lines

1:57:27.749 --> 1:57:32.712
No one is there

Don't you love farce?

1:57:46.893 --> 1:57:49.937
My fault, I fear

I thought that you'd want what I want

1:57:56.528 --> 1:58:00.197
Sorry, my dear

1:58:02.492 --> 1:58:07.163
But where are the clowns?

1:58:09.499 --> 1:58:14.462
There ought to be clowns

1:58:15.630 --> 1:58:22.595
Well, maybe next year
