WEBVTT

00:06.300 --> 00:07.733
- HEY, SHAWN.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

00:07.770 --> 00:08.896
- OH, YOU KNOW, THE USUAL.

00:08.940 --> 00:11.261
I'M HEADED UP TO MY ROOM
TO PLAY LEGEND OF ZELDA.

00:11.310 --> 00:14.302
- GOT A CALL FROM YOUR SCHOOL
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

00:14.340 --> 00:15.307
- UH, YOU DID?

00:15.340 --> 00:16.341
- MM-HMM, IT WAS THE NURSE.

00:16.380 --> 00:17.802
SHE SAID,
AND I QUOTE,

00:17.850 --> 00:21.274
"SHAWN TRIED TO GET HIMSELF
DECLARED INSANE TODAY."

00:21.320 --> 00:23.049
- HUH. THAT'S WEIRD.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.682
WOW, I MUST HAVE BEEN
IN A WEIRD FOG OR SOMETHING.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.314
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS
I'M FEELING MUCH BETTER NOW.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.385
- NO, DON'T--
AH, AH, AH, SHAWN.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.318
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.588
ABOUT PU'I'I'ING YOU
ON RITALIN.

00:34.630 --> 00:35.654
- OH, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.225
L-LET'S CONSIDER THIS
AN ISOLATED EPISODE, OKAY?

00:38.270 --> 00:39.635
I'M HOME NOW.
I'LL GET SOME REST.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.160
WE'LL PICK THIS UP TOMORROW.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.633
- DIDN'T YOU HAVE
YOUR QUARTERLY PROJECT

00:42.670 --> 00:44.604
DUE TODAY?

00:44.640 --> 00:46.733
- AGH.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.271
DID I?

00:49.310 --> 00:51.608
LIKE I SAID,
EVERYTHING WAS SUCH A BLUR.

00:51.650 --> 00:53.470
- KITCHEN TABLE.
NOW.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.215
- [sighs]

00:55.250 --> 00:56.342
- CALL THE SCHOOL
AND TELL THEM

00:56.390 --> 00:57.618
YOU'LL HAVE
YOUR ASSIGNMENT THERE

00:57.650 --> 01:00.118
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.753
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

01:05.790 --> 01:08.350
LASSIE SOLVES A CASE
WITHOUT ANY HELP

01:08.400 --> 01:10.459
AND THROWS A PARTY FOR HIMSELF
TO CELEBRATE?

01:10.500 --> 01:11.592
- I AM PROUD OF HIM.

01:11.630 --> 01:14.337
AND I THINK THAT HIS HARD WORK
SHOULD BE CONGRATULATED.

01:14.370 --> 01:15.598
- I'LL EAT TO THAT.
- YOU'LL EAT TO ANYTHING.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.732
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.738
- SO I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT THINKS THIS WHOLE AFFAIR

01:18.770 --> 01:19.634
IS A LITTLE OVER THE TOP

01:19.680 --> 01:21.102
IN THE SELF-CONGRATULATORY
DEPARTMENT?

01:21.140 --> 01:22.471
- HOW SO?

01:22.510 --> 01:25.445
- WELL, FOR STARTERS,
HE MADE THAT BANNER HIMSELF.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.640
- YEAH, BUT THE CRAFTSMANSHIP

01:26.680 --> 01:28.875
MORE THAN OFFSETS
THE MEGALOMANIA, SHAWN.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.444
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.378
HE PUT CRIME SCENE PHOTOS
ABOVE THE PUNCH BOWL.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.752
[eerie sounds]

01:34.790 --> 01:37.224
- IT'S CALLED THEMING.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.750
- YOU NEED TO FOLD THAT PITA.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.621
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
- MAKE IT INTO A CANOE.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.695
- DON'T TELL ME HOW TO EAT A--
[clunk]

01:41.730 --> 01:42.697
DAMN IT.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.891
[splat]

01:44.930 --> 01:46.488
- HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
THE FACT

01:46.540 --> 01:48.235
THAT YOU MIGHT BE
A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS?

01:48.270 --> 01:49.498
- WHY, BECAUSE GUS HAS DIP
ON HIS PANTS

01:49.540 --> 01:50.507
AND I DON'T?

01:50.540 --> 01:51.802
- NO, BECAUSE CARLTON SOLVED

01:51.840 --> 01:54.331
A HIGH-PROFILE CASE
WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM YOU.

01:54.380 --> 01:55.733
- [chuckling]
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL IT

01:55.780 --> 01:57.145
A HIGH-PROFILE CASE.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.204
- A BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN

01:58.250 --> 01:59.615
HAS AN AFFAIR
WITH HIS ASSISTANT.

01:59.650 --> 02:01.777
SHE TRIES TO BREAK IT OFF,
AND HE STRANGLES HER TO DEATH.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.481
IT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS
FOR MONTHS.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.680
- THANK YOU FOR MAKING
MY POINT.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.281
- I'M MAKING THE EXACT OPPOSITE
OF YOUR POINT.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.457
[clinking]

02:09.490 --> 02:10.650
- CAN I HAVE EVERYONE'S
ATTENTION, PLEASE?

02:10.690 --> 02:12.521
[clinking louder]

02:12.560 --> 02:13.629
HEY, EVERYB--

02:13.660 --> 02:14.820
SHUT YOUR PIE HOLES!

02:14.860 --> 02:16.725
- MM.

02:16.770 --> 02:21.537
- CHANNEL 23 IS DOING A STORY
ON MY CASE.

02:21.570 --> 02:22.867
- BERNIE BETHEL,

02:22.910 --> 02:25.538
THE BRILLIANT, RECLUSIVE
HEDGE FUND MANAGER

02:25.570 --> 02:27.777
STANDS ACCUSED OF MURDERING
SHEILA HANSEN

02:27.810 --> 02:29.949
IN WHAT PROSECUTORS
ARE CALLING

02:29.980 --> 02:31.345
A CRIME OF PASSION.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.610
- MR. BETHEL
HAS NOTHING TO SAY.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.187
- BETHEL HAS BEEN ON TRIAL
FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS,

02:36.220 --> 02:38.415
AND HIS LAWYER,
PHILLIP ZERN,

02:38.450 --> 02:40.350
IS USING THE INSANITY DEFENSE,
WHICH IS...

02:40.390 --> 02:41.709
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT BETHEL'S TRYING

02:41.760 --> 02:42.681
TO PRETEND HE'S NUTS?

02:42.730 --> 02:46.291
YOU'RE GONNA DO 50 YEARS
HARD TIME, BERNIE!

02:46.330 --> 02:47.888
- UH, DOES HE THINK THE TV
CAN HEAR HIM?

02:47.930 --> 02:50.228
- AT THIS POINT,
IT'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.828
- HERE'S BETHEL'S BROTHER
DANIEL,

02:51.870 --> 02:54.191
JUST OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE
EARLIER TODAY:

02:54.240 --> 02:55.764
- I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS
MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES

02:55.800 --> 02:57.404
TO THE HANSEN FAMILY.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.874
IT'S ALL VERY TRAGIC,
AND OUR FAMILY IS DEDICATED

02:59.910 --> 03:02.378
TO FINDING ANSWERS
TO MY BROTHER'S CONDITION.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.241
- AND NOW LET'S TURN
TO OUR EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW...

03:04.280 --> 03:06.771
[cheers and groans]
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.242
- ...WHO BROKE THIS CASE
WIDE OPEN.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.383
DETECTIVE LASSITER,
TAKE ME STEP BY STEP

03:09.420 --> 03:12.253
THROUGH YOUR INVESTIGATION.

03:12.290 --> 03:13.757
[triumphant music]

03:13.790 --> 03:14.552
- WHAT THE HELL?

03:14.590 --> 03:17.525
THERE BETTER BE
A MASSIVE PILEUP.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.652
WITH CASUALTIES.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.521
- ...BERNIE BETHEL CASE,
IN WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE

03:20.560 --> 03:22.619
AS A STUNNING VICTORY
FOR THE DEFENDANT...

03:22.670 --> 03:23.420
- NO.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.926
-...JUST FOUND BETHEL
NOT GUILTY

03:24.970 --> 03:27.461
BY REASON OF INSANITY.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.003
- NO!

03:30.040 --> 03:32.429
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY
OF JUSTICE.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.902
- I AM AS OUTRAGED BY IT
AS YOU.

03:33.940 --> 03:35.009
- I BUSTED MY ASS
TO NAIL THIS GUY,

03:35.040 --> 03:38.248
AND NOW HE GETS TO STAY
IN A CUSHY MENTAL HOSPITAL,

03:38.280 --> 03:39.611
TALKING ABOUT HIS FEELINGS,

03:39.650 --> 03:41.515
INSTEAD OF ROTTING IN PRISON,

03:41.550 --> 03:43.279
BUSTING ROCKS AND BUILDING
THE CROSS-COUNTRY RAILROAD.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.447
- WOW, THEY CAN SENTENCE YOU
TO GO BACK IN TIME?

03:45.490 --> 03:46.514
- LASSIE'S RIGHT.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.516
THAT HOSPITAL IS MORE LIKE
A RESORT THAN A JAIL.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.425
AND ONLY PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS
CONNECTIONS AND MONEY

03:50.460 --> 03:51.654
CAN GET IN.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.896
IT'S ALSO A HUGE ACCOUNT.

03:52.930 --> 03:55.398
MAN, IF I COULD SUPPLY JUST
THEIR CHLORDIAZEPOXIDE NEEDS,

03:55.430 --> 03:56.567
MY NUMBERS WOULD EXPLODE.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.021
- IT'S ALWAYS TIME
FOR BUSINESS, SHAWN.

03:59.070 --> 04:02.301
- CARLTON, YOU RAN
A FLAWLESS INVESTIGATION,

04:02.340 --> 04:03.637
BUT NOW THAT BETHEL
HAS BEEN SENTENCED,

04:03.670 --> 04:04.898
HE CAN'T BE TRIED
FOR THE SAME CRIME.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.408
IT SUCKS, BUT THERE'S NOTHING
ELSE WE CAN DO.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.771
- REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT.
[s|am!]

04:08.810 --> 04:10.402
AND I DO.
I REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.872
[s|am!]
- NOR DO I.

04:11.910 --> 04:12.945
- SPENCER,
WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?

04:12.980 --> 04:16.347
- I AM HERE TO TRY AND RIGHT
THIS TERRIBLE WRONG.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.641
- I DON'T NEED
YOUR HELP ON THIS.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.884
WHAT I NEED IS FOR YOU
TO STAY OUT OF IT.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.057
YOU WEREN'T EVEN ON THE CASE.

04:20.090 --> 04:21.614
- WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD'VE BEEN.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.821
- AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

04:23.860 --> 04:26.522
- O'HARA, I UNDERSTAND THAT
BETHEL CANNOT BE TRIED TWICE

04:26.560 --> 04:27.720
FOR THE SAME MURDER.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.057
HOWEVER, NOW HE'S COMMITTED
ANOTHER CRIME:

04:29.100 --> 04:30.988
HE'S PRETENDING
TO BE CRAZY.

04:31.030 --> 04:33.464
- LASSIE, YOUR THEORY
IS RIDICULOUS AND FARFETCHED.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.695
WHY WOULD SOMEONE POSSIBLY
PRETEND TO BE INSANE?

04:35.740 --> 04:37.503
- SO HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO
TO PRISON.

04:37.540 --> 04:38.529
- SOLD.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.902
- LOOK, I WOULD LOVE NOTHING
MORE THAN TO PROVE

04:40.940 --> 04:42.032
THAT BETHEL IS A FRAUD,

04:42.080 --> 04:43.308
BUT HOW DO WE DO THAT?

04:43.350 --> 04:44.601
- THE CHIEF SENDS ME
UNDERCOVER

04:44.650 --> 04:45.901
INTO THE PSYCHIATRIC
INSTITUTION,

04:45.950 --> 04:47.645
WHERE I GATHER EVIDENCE
TO PROVE HE'S A FRAUD,

04:47.680 --> 04:49.784
SO WE CAN OVERTURN HIS SENTENCE
AND SEND HIM TO PRISON.

04:49.820 --> 04:51.048
- YOU INTERVIEWED HIM
THREE TIMES

04:51.090 --> 04:52.318
DURING THE INVESTIGATION.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.384
HE KNOWS WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.910
- I'LL GROW A BEARD
AND WEAR NOTHING BUT TWEED.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.450
- CARLTON, THE MAN IS A GENIUS.

04:56.490 --> 04:57.752
HE MANAGED TO FOOL A JURY.

04:57.790 --> 04:59.496
I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA FALL
FOR YOU

04:59.530 --> 05:00.519
DRESSED AS LORD KENSINGTON.

05:00.560 --> 05:01.720
AND EVEN IF HE DID,

05:01.760 --> 05:02.920
THE CHIEF CAN'T OPEN
AN INVESTIGATION

05:02.970 --> 05:04.426
ON A CASE THAT'S CLOSED.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.791
- LASSITER'S INSTINCT S ARE GOOD.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.728
BETHEL'S RUSE WAS EASIER
TO KEEP UP FOR A JURY

05:08.770 --> 05:10.829
THAN IT WILL BE 24/7
INSIDE THE HOSPITAL.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.474
AND JULIET, YOU ARE RIGHT.

05:12.510 --> 05:15.502
THE CHIEF CAN'T OFFICIALLY
SANCT ION SUCH AN OPERATION.

05:15.540 --> 05:17.679
THE GOOD NEWS IS
AS HEAD OF CONSULTANTS,

05:17.710 --> 05:20.474
I'M NOT BOUND
BY THE SAME RESTRICTIONS.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.385
HENRY SPENCER, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS,

05:22.420 --> 05:23.887
BUT I LOVE IT.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.115
- IF I CAN GET VICK TO SIGN OFF
ON AN UNOFFICIAL STING,

05:26.150 --> 05:27.879
I'VE GOT A FRIEND
IN THE MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

05:27.920 --> 05:30.582
WHO, UH,
OWES ME A FAVOR.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.359
NOW, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

05:32.400 --> 05:35.528
IS COME UP
WITH THE RIGHT CANDIDATE

05:35.560 --> 05:39.098
TO SEND INSIDE.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.791
[Southern accent]
- THAT'S MY DADDY.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.933
- NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- I AGREE.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.460
- WHAT?
OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.863
I'M THE PERFECT CHOICE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.730
I DIDN'T WORK THE CASE.
BETHEL NEVER MET ME.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.702
- SHAWN DOES HAVE A WAY
OF, UH,

05:49.750 --> 05:50.842
SENSING THE TRUTH.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.848
- AND HE'S THE ONLY ONE OF US
WHO COULD ACTUALLY PASS

05:52.880 --> 05:54.677
FOR SOMEONE IN NEED
OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.948
- I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.811
- I WOULDN'T.
- LASSITER.

05:57.850 --> 06:01.957
SHAWN'S OUR BEST BET
AT PUTTING BETHEL BEHIND BARS.

06:01.990 --> 06:03.526
- DAMN IT.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.720
FINE, BUT THIS IS STILL
MY CASE,

06:04.760 --> 06:06.125
AND I'M RUNNING
THIS OPERATION.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.390
AND I INSIST,
WHEN WE ARE DONE,

06:08.430 --> 06:11.422
HE STAYS AN EXTRA 24 HOURS
FOR PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION.

06:11.470 --> 06:13.461
- HOW 'BOUT 48?
- DONE.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.728
- HA!

06:14.770 --> 06:18.661
[laughing maniacally]

06:18.710 --> 06:20.132
I'M GOING IN.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.809
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

06:23.850 --> 06:26.944
*

06:26.980 --> 06:30.814
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

06:30.850 --> 06:34.149
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

06:34.190 --> 06:36.112
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

06:36.160 --> 06:38.128
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

06:38.160 --> 06:41.596
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

06:41.630 --> 06:42.927
-*OOH

06:42.970 --> 06:47.862
- * YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

06:47.900 --> 06:51.802
* I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT
I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

06:51.840 --> 06:55.105
* I KNOW YOU KNOW THEY
JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

06:55.140 --> 06:56.676
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

06:56.710 --> 06:58.200
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

06:58.250 --> 07:00.514
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

07:00.550 --> 07:02.814
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU
OUT IN THE END *

07:30.750 --> 07:34.914
- AH.

07:34.950 --> 07:37.089
- YOU BEING LOCKED UP IN HERE
MAKES ME QUEASY, SHAWN.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.678
WHAT IF THEY DON'T LET YOU OUT?

07:38.720 --> 07:39.857
- OH, DON'T WORRY, JULES.

07:39.890 --> 07:41.482
I HAVE A KEEN UNDERSTANDING
FOR THE INSIDE

07:41.520 --> 07:42.487
OF MENTAL HOSPITALS.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.555
- WATCHING GIRL, INTERRUPTED
SIX TIMES

07:44.590 --> 07:45.682
DOES NOT MAKE YOU AN EXPERT.

07:45.730 --> 07:46.628
- NO, BUT SEVEN DOES.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.155
- WHAT.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.622
- THIS IS DR. ABEL ELLIOTT.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.036
- "THIS PLACE IS
A FASCIST TORTURE CHAMBER!

07:53.070 --> 07:55.197
WHERE'S LISA?
WHERE'S LISA?"

07:55.240 --> 07:56.161
THAT WAS FROM THE MOVIE.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.134
- YOU TWO ARE THE ONLY ONES
WHO GET THAT.

07:58.170 --> 07:58.966
- BESIDES WINONA RYDER.

07:59.010 --> 08:00.705
- DR. ELLIOTT IS
THE CHIEF OF STAFF

08:00.740 --> 08:02.844
FOR THE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.279
- [laughing]
DOCTOR.

08:04.310 --> 08:08.940
BURTON GUSTER,
CENTRAL COAST PHARMACEUTICALS.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.084
I'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR PSYCHOTROPIC NEEDS.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.849
OH, MY GOSH.

08:12.890 --> 08:16.678
ARE THOSE LAKER TICKETS
IN YOUR POCKET?

08:16.730 --> 08:19.119
- DR. ELLIOTT WILL BE
SHAWN'S CONTACT INSIDE.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.094
HE'S THE ONLY EMPLOYEE
PRIW TO OUR OPERATION.

08:21.130 --> 08:23.724
NOW, FOR SECURITY,
SHOULD ANY OTHER STAFF

08:23.770 --> 08:25.089
OTHER THAN DR. ELLIOTT
TRY TO MAKE CONTACT

08:25.130 --> 08:27.234
WITH YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE
AT SBPD,

08:27.270 --> 08:28.965
WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF SHAWN.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.558
- I'M COOPERATING
BECAUSE HENRY HAS

08:30.610 --> 08:32.669
SOME VERY INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS.

08:32.710 --> 08:33.972
BUT I THINK IT'S
EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL

08:34.010 --> 08:35.602
THAT BETHEL IS A FRAUD.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.143
HE'S BEEN UNDER MY CARE NOW
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS,

08:38.180 --> 08:39.249
AND IF HE'S FAKING IT,

08:39.280 --> 08:40.542
THEN HE'S THE BEST
I'VE EVER SEEN.

08:40.580 --> 08:41.979
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
DR. E.,

08:42.020 --> 08:43.578
I, TOO, AM A MAN OF SCIENCE.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.689
SEE, I'M A PSYCHIC.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.880
A DAMN GOOD ONE.

08:45.920 --> 08:46.955
I'M SO GOOD IT'S STUPID.

08:46.990 --> 08:49.049
I'M STUPID GOOD.

08:49.090 --> 08:50.580
- SHAWN.
- MY POINT IS,

08:50.630 --> 08:52.325
I'M QUITE CERTAIN
THAT BETHEL IS A FRAUD,

08:52.360 --> 08:54.328
THAT HE MEANT TO KILL
SHEILA HANSEN,

08:54.360 --> 08:55.896
AND I'M GONNA GO IN THERE
AND PROVE IT.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.227
- YOU HAVE FOUR DAYS
INSIDE, KID,

08:57.270 --> 08:59.192
DURING WHICH TIME
YOU'LL BE REQUIRED TO BLEND IN,

08:59.230 --> 09:00.663
PARTICIPATE IN GROUP THERAPY,

09:00.700 --> 09:01.837
AND TAKE MEDS.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.337
- I'M IN CHARGE
OF ALL PHARMACOLOGY,

09:03.370 --> 09:05.099
SO I'LL MAKE SURE ALL YOUR PILLS
ARE SUGAR PILLS.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.869
- SWEET--LITERALLY.
- [chuckles]

09:06.910 --> 09:10.676
- DR. ELLIOTT HAS COME UP
WITH A COVER DIAGNOSIS FOR YOU.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.246
- YOUR DEPARTMENTAL PROFILE
SUGGESTS

09:12.280 --> 09:14.874
THAT THE CLOSEST PSYCHOLOGICAL
IDENTIFICATION FOR YOU

09:14.920 --> 09:17.115
WOULD BE NARCISSISTIC
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

09:17.150 --> 09:18.310
- IT'S HANDSOME DISEASE.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.578
- OUR TECH PEOPLE PUT
A HIDDEN CAMERA

09:19.620 --> 09:21.087
IN THE POTTED PLANT
IN THE LIBRARY.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.656
YOU'LL BE GIVEN AN EARPIECE.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.226
- IT'S HOOKED UP TO A MONITOR
AND A RECORDING DEVICE

09:24.260 --> 09:25.579
IN THE HOSPITAL BASEMENT,

09:25.630 --> 09:27.052
WHERE LASSITER AND I
WILL BE.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.829
- ALL I GOTTA DO
IS BEFRIEND BETHEL,

09:28.860 --> 09:29.758
GET HIM TO TRUST ME,

09:29.800 --> 09:31.222
AND MAKE SURE HE'S
IN FRONT OF THAT CAMERA

09:31.270 --> 09:33.693
WHEN HE EXPOSES HIMSELF.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.866
- RIGHT IDEA.
WRONG CHOICE OF WORDS.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.959
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET CRACKING, PEOPLE.

09:37.010 --> 09:37.965
THE SOONER WE NAIL THIS BASTARD,

09:38.010 --> 09:39.875
THE SOONER WE CAN GET HIM
BEHIND REAL BARS.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.377
- UH, ONE LAST THING.

09:41.410 --> 09:43.071
WE'RE A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT YOU
BEING IN THERE ALONE.

09:43.110 --> 09:45.101
$0 FOR ADDED SECURITY,

09:45.150 --> 09:46.344
WE'RE SENDING GUS IN
WITH YOU.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.917
- OH, GREAT IDEA.

09:48.950 --> 09:51.248
THAT WAY I CAN BE
WITH DR. ELLIOTT CONSTANTLY.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.053
UH, MY COVER WILL BE TO LAND
THE LARGEST ACCOUNT

09:53.090 --> 09:54.057
OF MY CAREER

09:54.090 --> 09:56.388
AND GO TO A LAKERS GAME.

09:56.420 --> 09:59.184
- UH, ACTUALLY, WE'VE GOT
ANOTHER JOB FOR YOU.

09:59.230 --> 10:01.198
- REALLY?
WHAT'S THAT?

10:10.240 --> 10:11.207
- DUDE!

10:11.240 --> 10:14.129
THIS PLACE HAS
ELECTRONIC BIDETS.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.977
IT'S LIKE THE WESTIN
FOR INSANE PEOPLE.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.102
- WILL YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.378
YOU'RE GONNA BLOW OUR COVER.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.116
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HAVING
A GOOD TIME, SHAWN,

10:20.150 --> 10:21.378
BECAUSE I'M SURE AS HELL NOT.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.887
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
COMPLAINING ABOUT.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.046
YOU GET TO WEAR
THIS SWEET UNIFORM.

10:24.090 --> 10:24.909
- WHY DO I HAVE TO BE "SUGGS"?

10:24.950 --> 10:26.417
- THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT WOULD FIT.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.111
BESIDES, IT'S LIKE "GUS"
BACKWARDS.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.718
- YOU KNOW I ALWAYS HAVE
YOUR BACK, SHAWN,

10:29.760 --> 10:30.920
BUT THIS JOB IS DEGRADING.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.996
I'M NOT TOO SURE
HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN--

10:33.030 --> 10:33.997
- WHAT IS IT?

10:51.350 --> 10:53.238

10:55.720 --> 10:57.688
- NICE TO MEET YOU, VIVIENNE.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.381

10:59.420 --> 11:01.786
- I CAN CURE HER, SHAWN.
- YOU CAN'T--

11:01.820 --> 11:03.185
- WELL, VIVIENNE.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.379
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU NEED?

11:04.430 --> 11:05.886
- SOME APPLE JUICE
WOULD BE NICE.

11:05.930 --> 11:08.922
- RIGHT THIS WAY.

[suspicious music]

11:15.040 --> 11:17.338
*

11:17.370 --> 11:19.406
- DON'T WORRY, BERNIE.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.000
I'M GONNA KEEP CHECKING ON YOU
EVERY WEEK.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.746
- HERE'S BETHEL'S BROTHER
DANIEL,

11:23.780 --> 11:26.408
JUST OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE
EARLIER TODAY.

11:34.760 --> 11:35.909

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.178
I'LL BRING MORE NEXT TIME, OKAY?

11:38.230 --> 11:41.222

12:03.120 --> 12:04.883
- DUDE, ARE YOU SMELLING ME?

12:04.920 --> 12:06.808

12:17.970 --> 12:19.267
WHAT'S HIS STORY?

12:19.300 --> 12:21.029
- THAT'S LONGFELLOW.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.537
HE JUST GOT BACK
FROM THE SECOND FLOOR.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.037
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS
ON THE SECOND FLOOR?

12:24.070 --> 12:26.868
- WHAT AM I,
YOUR ORIENTATION ADVISOR?

12:26.910 --> 12:28.229
ALL I KNOW IS
WHEN YOU COME BACK,

12:28.280 --> 12:29.872
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME,

12:29.910 --> 12:32.913
MUCH LESS WHAT YOU HAD

- REALLY?

12:55.570 --> 12:59.131
- I CAN TELL YOU A LOT MORE
ABOUT YOURSELF, TOO.

12:59.170 --> 13:01.331
YOU MEET ME Al-TER DINNER
IN THE LIBRARY.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.007
I'M GONNA BRING DESSERT,
'CAUSE I CAN TELL

13:03.050 --> 13:04.540
THAT YOU...

13:04.580 --> 13:06.844
ARE A SKITTLES MAN.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.212
- YOU CAN GET SKITTLES
IN HERE?

13:09.250 --> 13:12.447
- I CAN DO ANYTHING.

13:15.360 --> 13:19.023

13:19.060 --> 13:21.449
I'D LIKE TO BEGIN
TODAY'S SESSION

13:21.500 --> 13:24.822
BY INTRODUCING OUR NEWEST MEMBER
TO THE GROUP.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.929
SHAWN "GTHORN DALL".

13:26.970 --> 13:27.959
- IT'S PRONOUNCED "THORNDALL".

13:28.000 --> 13:30.969
IT'S A SILENT G.

13:33.140 --> 13:36.007
- NURSE MCELROY,
SHE HAS A MIRROR.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.941
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
ABOUT MIRRORS?

13:38.980 --> 13:40.072
- WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM
WITH MIRRORS?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.417
- HE THINKS THEY STEAL
A PERSON'S SOUL.

13:41.450 --> 13:42.610
_ UM--
- YOU GOTTA STOP SCRATCHING.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.515
- [barks]

13:44.550 --> 13:46.586
- WOULD YOU JUST MAKE HER
PUT IT AWAY?

13:46.620 --> 13:49.259
- I NEED YOU
TO CALM DOWN, BERNIE.

13:49.290 --> 13:50.484
OKAY, LET'S TALK THIS THROUGH.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.986
YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT

13:52.030 --> 13:53.190
TO HAVE TO CALL OVER
THE ORDERLY

13:53.230 --> 13:54.549
TO RESTRAIN YOU.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.898
HAS HE HAD HIS PILL TODAY?

13:56.930 --> 13:58.192
- HE'S BEEN AVOIDING ME
ALL MORNING.

13:58.230 --> 14:00.892
- GET HIM ONE, PLEASE.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.431
YOUR FEAR OF MIRRORS
IS NOT REALITY-BASED.

14:03.470 --> 14:07.372
IT'S IN YOUR IMAGINATION.

14:13.950 --> 14:15.349
GOOD.

14:15.380 --> 14:20.010
NOW LET'S GET BACK TO SHAWN.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.016
TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF,
SHAWN.

- WELL, THEY TELL ME I'VE GOT
SOMETHING CALLED, UH,

14:25.090 --> 14:28.594
NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY
DISORDER.

14:28.630 --> 14:29.426
BUT, UH, THE TRUTH IS,

14:29.460 --> 14:31.291
THIS LUSTROUS HAIR
AND DIMPLED CHIN

14:31.330 --> 14:33.264
ARE MERELY CHAPTER ONE.

14:33.300 --> 14:36.167
I'M A VERITABLE CORNUCOPIA
OF HIGH-OCTANE MALADIES,

14:36.200 --> 14:38.566
SUCH AS OUTRAGEOUS
INTELLIGENCE SYNDROME.

14:38.610 --> 14:39.565
HUH?

14:39.610 --> 14:41.168
[chuckles]

14:41.210 --> 14:43.576
AND A LITTLE OBSESSIVE
SUCCESSFUL DISORDER.

14:43.610 --> 14:45.043
- GOODNESS.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.445
I'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED
A PATIENT

14:46.480 --> 14:48.448
WHO SUFFERS FROM SO MANY
DISEASES THAT DON'T EXIST.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.914
- WELL, THEY, UH,
THEY EXIST WHERE I COME FROM.

14:50.950 --> 14:55.080
- AND WHERE IS THAT?

14:55.120 --> 14:56.189
- YES, WENDELL.

14:56.220 --> 14:59.587

14:59.630 --> 15:02.190
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL
THE TRUTH HERE.

15:02.230 --> 15:03.663
- I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND, WENDELL.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.520
I'M TALKING ABOUT FORM.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.094
I'M TALKING ABOUT CONTENT.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.233
WE ALL KNOW WHO THE BROWNNOSER
IN THE GROUP IS,

15:09.270 --> 15:10.931
DON'T WE?

15:10.970 --> 15:12.460
- I JUST THINK YOU LIKE
LISTENING TO YOURSELF TALK.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.603
- WHOA.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.005
- YOU LOOK WAY TOO TOGETHER
TO BE IN HERE.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.439
- SAME ROBE EVERYONE ELSE HAS.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.378
- [quietly] UH, SHAWN,

15:18.410 --> 15:20.310
YOU BETTER COME UP
WITH SOMETHING QUICK.

15:20.350 --> 15:22.545
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET OUTED.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.686
- I'M PLENTY SICK, WENDELL!

15:25.720 --> 15:28.314
PILL TIME, EVERYBODY!
IT'S PILL TIME!

15:28.360 --> 15:30.453
PILLS, COME GET YOUR PILLS!

15:30.490 --> 15:32.253
- ORDERLY, RESTRAIN THE PATIENT.
- YES, MA'AM.

15:32.290 --> 15:33.427
- YOU CAN'T CATCH ME, MCELROY!

15:33.460 --> 15:35.121
I'M GONNA KEEP DOING THIS!

15:35.160 --> 15:36.627
I'M GONNA KEEP DRIVING AROUND
IN CIRCLES

15:36.660 --> 15:38.992
UNTIL I GET HUNGRY!

15:39.030 --> 15:40.668
AND THEN I'M GONNA EAT
THAT FOUNTAIN!

15:40.700 --> 15:42.463
I'M LIKE THE ICE CREAM MAN,

15:42.500 --> 15:44.138
EXCEPT I HAVE BARBITURATES!

15:44.170 --> 15:45.262
HA!

15:45.310 --> 15:46.971
- YOU'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
ONE DAY,

15:47.010 --> 15:48.329
AND TH EY'VE ALREADY GOT YOU
IN RESTRAINTS?

15:48.380 --> 15:49.972
- OH, COME ON.

15:50.010 --> 15:51.500
DR. ELLIOTT'S ONLY MAKING ME
WEAR THESE MITTENS

15:51.550 --> 15:52.676
TO PROTECT MY COVER.

15:52.710 --> 15:54.519
- THAT AND I WAS CONCERNED

15:54.550 --> 15:55.642
SHAWN REALLY
MIGHT BE UNSTABLE.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.045
- OH, YOU.
PSHHH!

15:57.090 --> 15:58.443
[chuckles]

15:58.490 --> 15:59.582
- OH, MY GOD.
THIS WAS MY FEAR.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.053
MY WORST NIGHTMARE
IS COMING TRUE.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.058
- JULES, RELAX.
I'M RIGHT AS RAIN.

16:03.090 --> 16:04.682
BESIDES, THE DOC SAID
I COULD TAKE THESE THINGS OFF

16:04.730 --> 16:05.583
AN HOUR AGO.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.291
- THEN WHY ARE YOU
STILL WEARING THEM?

16:07.330 --> 16:09.150
- THE INNER LINING
IS SO SOI-T.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.189
I THINK IT'S ALPACA.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.393
MAYBE BABY MUSKRAT.
YOU GOTTA CHECK THIS OUT.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.294
- I DON'T WANT TO, SHAWN.
- YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.604
- FINE.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.699
WOW, THEY ARE SUPPLE.

16:19.740 --> 16:20.502
TRY IT, LASSIE.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.474
- ENOUGH WITH THE STUPID
MITTENS.

16:22.510 --> 16:23.670
THEY ARE QUITE SOI-T.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.041
WHAT PROGRESS HAVE YOU MADE
WITH BETHEL?

16:25.080 --> 16:27.310
- THAT DUDE IS GOOD.
REALLY GOOD.

16:27.350 --> 16:30.114
THE WAY HE RANTED ON ABOUT BEING
TERRIFIED OF MIRRORS

16:30.150 --> 16:32.448
ALMOST CONVINCED ME
IT WAS A REAL CONDITION.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.718
- IT IS,
WHICH SUPPORTS MY BELIEF

16:33.760 --> 16:35.057
THAT BERNIE IS TRULY SICK.

16:35.090 --> 16:36.057
- FEAR OF ONE'S OWN REFLECTION

16:36.090 --> 16:38.058
IS CALLED EISOPTROPHOBIA.

16:38.090 --> 16:39.455
- OOH, SOMEONE KNOWS
THEIR STUFF.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.151
THEN YOU MUST ALSO BE FAMILIAR

16:41.200 --> 16:42.451
WITH MULTIPLE PERSONALITY
DISORDER.

16:43.630 --> 16:45.063
- THAT'S WHAT VIVIENNE
SUFFERS FROM.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.328
YOU KNOW VIVIENNE,
THE PATIENT YOU'VE BEEN

16:46.370 --> 16:47.689
INAPPROPRIATELY FLIRTING WITH?

16:47.740 --> 16:49.731
- OH, DOC,
GUS CAN'T HELP HIMSELF.

16:49.770 --> 16:50.805
HE'S GOT A WEAKNESS
FOR CRAZY CHICKS.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.262
- THE LAST WOMAN I WAS
INTERESTED IN

16:52.310 --> 16:53.379
TURNED OUT TO BE A MURDERER.

16:53.410 --> 16:56.470
OH, BY THE WAY, CAN I GET THOSE
LAKER TICKETS BACK?

16:56.510 --> 16:57.704
- NO.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.116
- I'M TELLING YOU,
BETHEL IS A GENIUS.

17:00.150 --> 17:01.219
HE'S VERY WELL RESEARCHED.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.184
HE'S ACQUIRED A WHOLE BUNCH
OF PHOBIAS FOR HIMSELF.

17:03.220 --> 17:04.448
FEAR OF LOUD NOISES,
FEAR OF CROWDS,

17:04.490 --> 17:05.445
FEAR OF SAXOPHONES.

17:05.490 --> 17:07.082
IT'S ALL BOGUS.
SPENCER!

17:07.120 --> 17:08.451
- YEAH.
DON'T WORRY, MAN.

17:08.490 --> 17:10.583
I'M GONNA GET THIS GUY
TO CONFESS ON CAMERA

17:10.630 --> 17:11.551
RIGHT Al-TER DINNER.

17:11.590 --> 17:13.558
I JUST NEED ONE THING
TO CLOSE THIS DEAL.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.591
IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT.

17:15.630 --> 17:18.793
- WHAT'S THAT?

17:18.830 --> 17:21.196
- EARPIECE CHECK,
EARPIECE CHECK.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.232
SPENCER, WE'VE BEEN WAITING HERE
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.747
- I THINK BERNIE'S
A NO-SHOW.

17:37.790 --> 17:41.282
- SPENCER, YOU'RE TALKING
TO THE WRONG PLANT.

17:45.260 --> 17:47.251
- I THOUGHT FOR SURE
THAT THE SKITTLES WOULD--

17:47.300 --> 17:48.221
- STILL TALKING TO THE WRONG--

17:48.260 --> 17:49.727
IT'S THE ONE ON THE TABLE.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.593
THE TABLE.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.399
- [whispering]
LIGHTS OUT IN 15 MINUTES.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.737
WE'LL HAVE TO PICK THIS UP
IN THE MORNING.

17:59.770 --> 18:01.874
- OH, DAMN IT.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.879
[ominous music]

18:04.910 --> 18:08.346
*

18:08.380 --> 18:12.589
- [whispering]
SHAWN.

18:12.620 --> 18:16.351
SHAWN, WAKE UP.
WAKE UP.

18:16.390 --> 18:18.551
- MMMM.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.490
HEY, MAN.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.657
OH, I WAS GETTING THE BEST SLEEP
I'VE HAD IN YEARS.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.225
IT'S LIKE THESE SHEETS
ARE WOVEN FROM STRANDS

18:25.270 --> 18:28.694
OF WARM SPRINGTIME SUNBEAMS.

18:28.740 --> 18:29.729
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

18:29.770 --> 18:32.261
- I'VE BEEN BUSY CLEANING UP
AI-TER THESE SLOBS.

18:32.310 --> 18:35.370
I'M SORRY, SHAWN,
BUT INSANITY IS NO EXCUSE

18:35.410 --> 18:37.605
FOR NOT HAVING THE DECENCY
TO HANG UP YOUR OWN TOWEL.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.572
- HMM.
- BUT LISTEN.

18:39.610 --> 18:41.146
AS I WAS HEADING
TOWARDS THE LAUNDRY,

18:41.180 --> 18:42.738
I JUST SAW BETHEL
SNEAKING OUT OF HIS ROOM,

18:42.780 --> 18:43.781
HEADING TOWARDS THE KITCHEN.

18:43.820 --> 18:45.344
- [yawns]
COME ON, MAN.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.779
HE PROBABLY JUST WANTS
A SNACK.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.458
- OR TRYING TO ESCAPE.

18:49.490 --> 18:50.752
COME ON!

18:50.790 --> 18:53.827
[snealq music]

18:53.860 --> 19:00.493
*

19:00.540 --> 19:02.838
- HEY, THERE.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.633
- HELLO, VIVIENNE.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.331
- WHO'S VIVIENNE?
I'M FRANK.

19:06.370 --> 19:08.179
- FRANK?

19:08.210 --> 19:10.246
- PLUMBER FROM LODI.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.305
HEY, YOU WANNA COME IN?
GOT THE GAME ON.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.568
- UM, NO, THANK YOU.

19:14.620 --> 19:15.871
BUT IF YOU SEE VIVIENNE,

19:15.920 --> 19:19.742
CAN YOU TELL HER
GUS STOPPED BY?

19:19.790 --> 19:21.610
- HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

19:21.660 --> 19:22.615
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

19:22.660 --> 19:23.957
IF A DUDE KISSES
A CRAZY WOMAN

19:23.990 --> 19:25.082
WHO THINKS SHE'S A DUDE,

19:25.130 --> 19:27.291
IS THAT THE SAME THING AS A DUDE
KISSING A CRAZY DUDE?

19:27.330 --> 19:28.490
- THAT'S THE MOST
RIDICULOUS THING

19:28.530 --> 19:29.952
YOU'VE EVER ASKED ME.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.592
AND YES.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.632
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

19:40.910 --> 19:44.300
[strange music]

19:44.350 --> 19:45.578
- USE BOTH.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.942
BOTH OF THEM.

19:47.980 --> 19:50.380
- OKAY, THAT'S WEIRD.
- IT IS.

19:50.420 --> 19:51.614
IT IS, SHAWN.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.481
- WHAT IS HE DOING
TO THE FRIDGE?

19:53.520 --> 19:54.714
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.489
WHY WOULD BETHEL DO
SOMETHING INSANE

19:56.520 --> 19:58.226
WHEN THERE'S NO ONE AROUND
TO SEE IT?

19:58.260 --> 20:01.320
- BOTH OF THEM.
BOTH OF THEM.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.727
- GUS, THERE IS ONE THING
WE HAVE YET TO CONSIDER.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.761
- WHAT IS THAT, SHAWN?

20:10.670 --> 20:13.935
- WHAT IF BERNIE
ISN'T FAKING IT AT ALL?

20:19.610 --> 20:22.613
- GUYS, I AM GETTING SOME VERY
STRONG PSYCHIC VIBRATIONS

20:22.650 --> 20:24.015
THAT WE NEED
TO AT LEAST CONSIDER

20:24.050 --> 20:27.713
THE POSSIBILITY THAT BERNIE
IS LEGITIMATELY INSANE.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.684
- WHAT?

20:30.730 --> 20:31.856
- ARE YOU SENSING
SOMETHING ELSE?

20:31.890 --> 20:33.994
- NO, NO, JUST SOME WATER
STUCK IN MY EAR

20:34.030 --> 20:35.327
FROM THIS MORNING'S
FREE SWIM.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.464
- THEY HAVE A POOL HERE?
- HEATED.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.388
AND A GYM
WITH FULL NAUTILUS.

20:39.430 --> 20:40.590
AND A MUSIC ROOM.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.993
AND A LEATHER TOOLING CLASS.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.907
SPOILER ALERT:
I'M MAKING YOU A WALLET.

20:44.940 --> 20:45.964
- OH, MY GOD.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.001
THIS IS WORSE THAN MY NIGHTMARE.
YOU LIKE IT HERE.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.645
- I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD
STOOP SO LOW, SPENCER.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.647
- EXCUSE ME?

20:51.680 --> 20:52.647
- YOU JUST CAN'T STAND

20:52.680 --> 20:53.772
TO SEE ME WINNING,
CAN YOU?

20:53.820 --> 20:56.618
IT GALLS YOU SO MUCH THAT I
SOLVED THE BETHEL MURDER

20:56.650 --> 20:57.685
WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM YOU,

20:57.720 --> 20:59.483
YOU'RE GONNA THROW
A MONKEY WRENCH INTO MY CASE.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.715
- LOOK, LASSIE,
I ADMIT I HAVE TAKEN GREAT JOY

21:01.760 --> 21:03.489
IN WATCHING YOU FAIL
IN THE PAST,

21:03.530 --> 21:04.485
NUMEROUS TIMES.

21:04.530 --> 21:05.519
68, TO BE EXACT.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.494
BUT THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM, MAN.

21:07.530 --> 21:08.952
I TRULY BELIEVE
THAT BERNIE IS DERANGED.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.366
- GUSTER, YOU WERE THERE.
- HUH?

21:11.400 --> 21:13.664
- YOU WERE THERE.
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

21:13.700 --> 21:14.894
- MAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I SAW.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.362
- YES, YOU DO.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.368
- LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS
I HAD TO GIVE

21:18.410 --> 21:20.605
AN UNCOOPERATIVE CHEROKEE
A SPONGE BATH THIS MORNING.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.370
SO THE ONLY PERSON AROUND HERE
WHO I KNOW IS CRAZY IS ME

21:23.410 --> 21:25.674
FOR ALLOWING MYSELF
TO GET ROPED INTO THIS NONSENSE.

21:25.710 --> 21:28.645
- LASSIE, GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO PROVE TO YOU

21:28.680 --> 21:29.874
THAT BERNIE IS DISTURBED.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.808
I'LL GET HIM INTO THAT LIBRARY
IN AN HOUR,

21:31.850 --> 21:33.454
AND IF I AM WRONG,

21:33.490 --> 21:36.015
YOU CAN SHOVE IT IN MY FACE
AND MUSH IT AROUND FOR MONTHS.

21:36.060 --> 21:39.427
- I DO ENJOY WATCHING YOU
MAKE AN ASS OF YOURSELF.

21:39.460 --> 21:40.859
THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING IT
ON VIDEO

21:40.900 --> 21:42.629
IS TOO GOOD TO PASS UP.

21:42.660 --> 21:45.527
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT ONE HOUR.

21:45.570 --> 21:49.734
[snealq music]

21:49.770 --> 21:50.930
- BERNIE, BUDDY,

21:50.970 --> 21:53.029
I GIVE YOU A RAINBOW.

21:53.070 --> 21:54.674
- OHHH.

21:54.710 --> 21:55.734
- [laughs]

21:55.780 --> 21:57.441
TOLD YOU, MAN.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.801
LOOK AT ALL THOSE SKITTLES.

21:59.850 --> 22:01.909
WHOO, WHY DON'T WE
COME OVER HERE

22:01.950 --> 22:04.009
AND REST THOSE DOGS?

22:04.050 --> 22:05.017
- OOH.

22:05.050 --> 22:07.587
- [laughing]
OOH, YEAH.

22:07.620 --> 22:08.780
- OHHH, YEAH.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.720
- LOOK AT ALL THOSE
SKITTLES, MAN.

22:10.760 --> 22:11.658
- YEAH.

22:11.690 --> 22:13.726
- SPENCER, MOVE THE CAMERA
TO THE RIGHT.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.421
- WHAT'S, UH,
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE, UH,

22:15.460 --> 22:17.428
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FLAVOR
THERE, BERN?

22:17.470 --> 22:18.494
- IT'S TOO CLOSE.
CAN YOU PULL IT BACK?

22:18.530 --> 22:20.566
- WELL, I LIKE GRAPE.
- YEAH?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.067
- AND I LIKE--
- NO, NO.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.067
NO, MOVE IT BACK
TO THE LEI-T.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.660
- AND I LIKE ORANGE.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.507
- JUST A LITTLE BIT.
CAN YOU MOVE IT BACK?

22:27.540 --> 22:28.871
- AND I LIKE CHERRY.
- NO.

22:28.910 --> 22:30.844
YEAH, OKAY, PERFECT.
JUST STOP TOUCHING IT.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.074
- AND ORANGE.

22:32.110 --> 22:34.613
- YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
ALL OF THEM, MAN.

22:34.650 --> 22:35.844
- NO.
LEMON.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.586
- I GOTTA TELL YOU, BERNIE,

22:37.620 --> 22:41.488
I BELIEVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY
THAT YOU ARE INSANE.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.988
ALL RIGHT?
CUCKOO.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.055
SIX FAT, SWEET NUTS
TO THE WIND.

22:46.090 --> 22:48.729
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE
THAT DON'T.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.990
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME HELP YOU.

22:51.030 --> 22:51.997
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

22:52.030 --> 22:53.668
- OKAY.

22:53.700 --> 22:54.792
- YOU JUST--
YOU KEEP EATING,

22:54.840 --> 22:56.762
AND WE'RE GONNA PLAY A GAME.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.837
WHAT I LIKE TO CALL--
BOOM!

23:05.210 --> 23:08.941
BERNIE...

23:08.980 --> 23:10.516
- HMM?

23:10.550 --> 23:12.188
- WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?
WHY AREN'T YOU FREAKING OUT?

23:12.220 --> 23:14.415
- I'M NOT AFRAID.
- WHAT?

23:14.460 --> 23:15.757
- ISN'T THAT GREAT?
- NO.

23:15.790 --> 23:16.779
IT'S NOT GREAT.

23:16.820 --> 23:19.618
- I KNEW IT!
- THIS IS NOT GREAT.

23:19.660 --> 23:22.493
- DO YOU SEE THAT?
- SPENCER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:22.530 --> 23:23.929
TURN THE CAMERA BACK
TO BERNIE.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.029
- IS THE NEW TWILIGHT BOOK IN?
- NOT NOW, FRANK.

23:26.070 --> 23:28.891
- WHAT'S UP, GIRL?

23:28.940 --> 23:32.068
WHERE YOU BEEN?

23:32.110 --> 23:34.032
- IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.878
WHY WOULD HE ALL OF A SUDDEN
START ACTING SANE?

23:36.910 --> 23:38.775
- FACE IT, SPENCER,
YOU GOT PLAYED.

23:38.810 --> 23:39.879
BETHEL PULLED ONE OVER
ON YOU.

23:39.910 --> 23:42.879
I TOLD YOU HE WAS A GENIUS.
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE,

23:42.920 --> 23:46.014
THIS JUST MEANS THAT I AM
ONE STEP CLOSER TO PROVING

23:46.050 --> 23:49.053
THAT I WAS RIGHT AND
HE'S A FAKE.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.824
- AND ONE, AND TWO,

23:54.860 --> 23:58.591
AND YOU'RE A BRANCH
REACHING UP TO THE SKY.

24:01.670 --> 24:04.002
- [whispers] HEY, BERNIE.
- YEAH?

24:04.040 --> 24:06.031
- I WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU
TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING,

24:06.070 --> 24:07.674
AND I WAS DEAD-ON
ABOUT THE SKITTLES,

24:07.710 --> 24:09.132
SO YOU KNOW I'M THE REAL DEAL.

24:09.180 --> 24:11.045
RIGHT NOW, I'M SENSING
THE COPS ARE ABOUT

24:11.080 --> 24:12.172
TO FIGURE OUT
THAT YOU'RE A FAKE,

24:12.210 --> 24:15.475
SO IF YOU WANT MY HELP,
YOU BETTER COME CLEAN RIGHT NOW.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.011
- SHAWN, I AM NOT A FAKE.

24:18.050 --> 24:20.780
I REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN RIGHT
THESE LAST FEW YEARS.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.788
IT'S WHY I NEVER LEI-T
THE HOUSE.

24:22.820 --> 24:25.823
NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG TIME,

24:25.860 --> 24:28.192
I'M STARTING TO
FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN.

24:28.230 --> 24:31.222
- THERE YOU ARE, BERNIE.
IT'S TIME FOR YOUR PILL.

24:47.650 --> 24:50.016
- ORDERLY...

24:50.050 --> 24:52.780
I'D VERY MUCH
LIKE TO DO A CANNONBALL.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.014
- WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:54.060 --> 24:56.119
- HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR
ANTI-PSYCHOTIC DRUGS TO KICK IN?

24:56.160 --> 24:57.115
- ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.980
- HOW LONG HAS BETHEL
BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED?

24:59.030 --> 25:01.021
- TWO WEEKS.
- THAT'S IT.

25:01.060 --> 25:02.925
HE'S SANE BECAUSE
HIS MEDS HAVE KICKED IN.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.791
- MAYBE HE WANTS YOU
TO THINK HIS MEDICATION

25:04.830 --> 25:06.024
ISN'T WORKING,
WHEN IN FACT THERE WAS NEVER

25:06.070 --> 25:07.935
ANYTHING WRONG WITH HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

25:07.970 --> 25:09.995
NOW STAY HERE!

25:10.040 --> 25:14.079
- COME ON, EVERYONE.
REACH OUT AND GRAB THAT AIR.

25:26.620 --> 25:29.009
- D-DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
I'LL BRING THEM NEXT TIME.

25:29.060 --> 25:31.324
- HE EVEN PUT THE CRIME SCENE
PHOTOS ABOVE THE PUNCH BOWL.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.920
- BERNIE.
- YEAH?

25:33.960 --> 25:36.326
- WHY DON'T YOU
OPEN YOUR LEI-T HAND?

25:36.360 --> 25:41.059
- I CAN'T, I HAVE DEGENERATIVE
ARTHRITIS IN THAT HAND.

25:41.100 --> 25:44.763
- SINCE WHEN?
- SINCE THE LAST FEW YEARS.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.664
- WHAT?
ARE YOU TELLING ME

25:46.710 --> 25:48.837
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO USE
YOUR LEI-T HAND FOR A FEW YEARS?

25:48.880 --> 25:50.199
- NO.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.572
- THAT MEANS YOU COULDN'T HAVE
STRANGLED SHEILA HANSON.

25:52.610 --> 25:54.646
THAT'S EVIDENCE.
THAT COULD'VE EXONERATED YOU.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.113
WHY DIDN'T THAT
COME OUT IN COURT?

25:56.150 --> 25:59.085
DID YOUR LAWYER KNOW
ABOUT YOUR ARTHRITIC CONDITION?

25:59.120 --> 25:59.939
- [sighs]

25:59.990 --> 26:02.083
THE LAST FEW YEARS
HAVE BEEN A BLUR.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.350
AND DURING THE TRIAL,
I WAS AT MY WORST.

26:04.390 --> 26:07.188
I COULDN'T SAY OR DO
ANYTHING TO HELP MYSELF.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.824
AND PEOPLE HAD TO MAKE
ALL MY DECISIONS FOR ME.

26:12.830 --> 26:14.195
- MAN, I THINK
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.060
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE'S NOT CONNING YOU?

26:16.100 --> 26:18.204
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE CAN'T
USE HIS LEI-T HAND FOR SURE?

26:18.240 --> 26:21.232
- WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT, ISN'T THERE?

26:22.380 --> 26:25.349
- HMM.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.677
- [clears throat, whispers]
HEY, BERNIE.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.779
- YEAH?
- DO ME A FAVOR.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.344
HOLD ONTO THIS, WOULD YOU?
THANKS.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.813
- AGH!

26:30.850 --> 26:31.942
[loud thud]
OH!

26:31.990 --> 26:33.287
OH, GOD!
OH!

26:33.320 --> 26:35.618
OH!
- BERNIE.

26:35.660 --> 26:36.786
- GOD. OH.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.822
- OH, MAN.
BERN, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, MAN?

26:38.860 --> 26:39.986
- THAT DIDN'T GO THE WAY
YOU SAW IN YOUR HEAD, DID IT?

26:40.030 --> 26:41.054
- YEAH, COMPLETELY.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.125
- ORDERLY, RESTRAIN
THAT PATIENT.

26:43.160 --> 26:45.128
- I-I DIDN'T--
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

26:45.170 --> 26:46.819
- YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
- NO!

26:46.870 --> 26:48.132
NO!

26:48.170 --> 26:49.990
N'AH! AH!

26:50.040 --> 26:51.735
OW. OW. OW.

26:51.770 --> 26:54.876
- OKAY.
NEVER TOOK MY SIDE, EVER.

26:54.910 --> 26:57.276
I REMEMBER ONCE,
A TREE FELL OVER,

26:57.310 --> 26:59.301
SMASHED INTO THE GARAGE
DURING A STORM.

26:59.350 --> 27:00.908
HE TOLD ME IT WAS MY FAULT

27:00.950 --> 27:03.418
'CAUSE I WASN'T FULLY COMMITTED
TO THE PRUNING PROCESS.

27:03.450 --> 27:05.680
EXCUSE YOU.
- WE NEED TO GET OUTTA HERE.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.018
- I HAPPEN TO BE MAKING
SOME SERIOUS PROGRESS HERE.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.016
- THEY JUST RELEASED BETHEL
FROM THE INFIRMARY.

27:10.060 --> 27:12.949
- [loud whiny voice]
BUT I LOVE MY DAD.

27:12.990 --> 27:14.252
[sniffles]

27:14.300 --> 27:16.860
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I'M SEQUESTERED FOR TWO DAYS

27:16.900 --> 27:18.162
FOR WHAT,
A LITTLE FOOT FRACTURE?

27:18.200 --> 27:20.760
- HEY, VIVIENNE.
- HEY, GUS.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.928
- I CAN SEE YOU HAVE NOT
HEEDED DR. ELLIOT'S WARNINGS

27:23.970 --> 27:26.029
ABOUT SEEING VIVIENNE.
- I LIKE HER, SHAWN.

27:26.070 --> 27:27.367
AND NO, THE RELATIONSHIP
IS NOT PERFECT.

27:27.410 --> 27:28.968
- RELATIONSHIP.
- I MEAN, SOMETIMES,

27:29.010 --> 27:30.807
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE
SHE TURNS INTO A DUDE.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.943
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
FRANK IS VERY INTERESTING.

27:32.980 --> 27:34.174
DID YOU KNOW THAT
HE'S A GULF WAR VETERAN?

27:34.220 --> 27:35.346
DID YOU KNOW THAT
YOU ARE QUITE POSSIBLY

27:35.380 --> 27:36.813
THE WORST ORDERLY OF ALL TIME?

27:36.850 --> 27:37.942
- I'LL TAKE THAT AS
A COMPLIMENT.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.389
- YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T.
- [yells]

27:39.420 --> 27:42.253
YOU'RE--NO, YOU'RE--
NO, NO.

27:42.290 --> 27:43.848
- BERNIE, YOU NEED TO
TAKE YOUR PILL.

27:43.890 --> 27:44.959
- MM-MM.
- NOW COME ON.

27:44.990 --> 27:46.423
THIS IS WHAT MﬁléES YOU BETTER.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.325
- TAKE THE PILL.
PUT OUT YOUR HAND.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.691
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

27:49.730 --> 27:50.992
- WHY IS BETHEL
BACK TO BEING CRAZY?

27:51.030 --> 27:52.395
- TAKE YOUR PILL, BERNIE.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.276
- GUS...IT'S A DIFFERENT PILL.

28:02.310 --> 28:04.699
IT'S BLUE, BUT
THE EDGES ARE SQUARE.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.378
NOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF THEY GAVE BERNIE NEW MEDS

28:07.410 --> 28:09.446
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS
THAT HAD THE REVERSE EFFECTS

28:09.480 --> 28:10.947
OF THE ONES THAT
WERE MAKING HIM STABLE?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.480
- IT COULD RESULT
IN PSYCHOTIC BEHAVIOR.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.078
- THERE YOU GO.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.917
DRINK THAT DOWN.
VERY GOOD.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.359
- [soft whimper]

28:17.390 --> 28:19.779
- I THINK SOMEONE IN HERE
WANTS TO KEEP BERNIE INCOHERENT.

28:19.830 --> 28:21.388
- WHO?

28:21.430 --> 28:23.318
- I'M IN CHARGE
OF ALL PHARMACOLOGY,

28:23.360 --> 28:25.328
SO I'LL MAKE SURE
YOU'LL ONLY GET SUGAR PILLS.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.395
- DR. ELLIOT.
HE'S IN CHARGE OF MEDICATION.

28:27.430 --> 28:28.966
IT MUST BE HIM.
- WHY WOULD ELLIOT WANT BETHEL

28:29.000 --> 28:30.467
TO STAY INSANE?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.365
HE'S THE ONE WHO PUT BETHEL
ON THE ORIGINAL DOSE,

28:32.410 --> 28:33.775
WHY WOULD HE WANNA
REVERSE THE PROCESS?

28:33.810 --> 28:34.629
- HE WOULDN'T.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.137
UNLESS SOMEONE
WAS PAYING HIM TO DO IT.

28:37.180 --> 28:38.841
SOMEONE WITH A MOTIVE
TO KEEP BERNIE UNSTABLE.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.245
- AND WHAT WOULD
THAT SOMEONE'S MOTIVE BE?

28:40.280 --> 28:42.248
- I DON'T KNOW YET.
- JUST STAY RIGHT HERE.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.339
COME ON.
OKAY, WAIT.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.846
- ORDERLY!

28:45.890 --> 28:47.312
CAN I GET SOME HELP OVER HERE?
- NO, NO, NO!

28:47.350 --> 28:48.886
- BETTER DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.217
- NO, NO, NO.
- GOTTA MAINTAIN OUR COVER

28:50.260 --> 28:51.454
UNTIL I CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.

28:51.490 --> 28:53.890
I'LL GO CONFRONT ELLIOT AND
FIGURE OUT WHO HE'S WORKING FOR.

28:53.930 --> 28:55.022
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:55.060 --> 28:56.095
- I GOT THIS, SHAWN.

28:56.130 --> 28:59.327
CALM DOWN,
AND NOBODY GETS HURT.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.176
- AW, MAN.

29:16.220 --> 29:17.471
[loud thud]
OOH.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.512
[thud to floor]

29:30.560 --> 29:33.427
- WHERE'S SHAWN?
- STILL AT THE HOSPITAL.

29:33.470 --> 29:35.461
- WHY DID YOU LEAVE HIM?
- I WAS FIRED,

29:35.500 --> 29:36.865
AND IMMEDIATELY
ESCORTED OFF THE PROPERTY.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.208
- FIRED FOR WHAT?

29:38.240 --> 29:41.209
- WELL, AFTER I HELPED
NURSE MCELROY CALM DOWN BETHEL,

29:41.240 --> 29:43.299
I RAN INTO VIVIENNE,
AND ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER,

29:43.340 --> 29:45.501
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
WE WERE HOLDING HANDS.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.177
AND THEN
SOMEBODY RATTED US OUT.

29:47.210 --> 29:48.973
I HAVE A FEELING
IT WAS THAT WEASEL WENDELL,

29:49.020 --> 29:50.009
BUT I CAN'T RULE OUT FRANK.

29:50.050 --> 29:51.142
- WHERE'S SPENCER?

29:51.190 --> 29:54.011
- STILL AT THE HOSPITAL.
- WHY? HIS FOUR DAYS ARE UP.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.516
- SHAWN FIGURED OUT
THAT SOMEBODY'S BEEN TAMPERING

29:55.560 --> 29:58.188
WITH BETHEL'S MEDICATION
TO MAKE HIM STAY DISTURBED.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.857
PROBABLY DR. ELLIOT.

29:59.890 --> 30:02.199
HE ALSO PROVED THAT BETHEL
HAS ARTHRITIS IN HIS LEI-T HAND.

30:02.230 --> 30:04.960
MEANING HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE STRANGLED SHEILA HANSON.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.059
- AND WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE...ANY OF THIS?

30:07.100 --> 30:08.863
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
IF HE HAS ARTHRITIS,

30:08.900 --> 30:10.037
WHY DIDN'T THAT
COME OUT IN THE TRIAL?

30:10.070 --> 30:11.435
- THAT'S WHAT SHAWN ASKED HIM.

30:11.470 --> 30:13.199
BUT BETHEL SAID
THAT HE WAS IN SUCH A FOG

30:13.240 --> 30:15.435
THAT HE CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER
HE TOLD HIS ATTORNEY OR NOT.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.970
- WELL, WE HAVE
TO TALK TO THAT LAWYER.

30:17.010 --> 30:19.171
I MEAN, IF THERE'S
EVEN A REMOTE POSSIBILITY

30:19.210 --> 30:21.872
THAT HE WITHHELD EVIDENCE THAT
COULD'VE EXONERATED HIS CLIENT,

30:21.920 --> 30:23.148
WE HAVE TO
AT LEAST QUESTION HIM.

30:23.180 --> 30:26.445
- MM-HMM.
- FINE, I'LL GET MY JACKET.

30:26.490 --> 30:28.014
- AND WHEN YOU SEE SHAWN,

30:28.060 --> 30:29.482
WILL YOU TELL HIM TO
CALL ME ASAP?

30:38.900 --> 30:41.130
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WH-WHAT HAPPENED?

30:41.170 --> 30:43.491
- WE FOUND YOU IN A RESTRICTED
AREA, PASSED OUT ON THE FLOOR.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.428
- YEAH, SOMEBODY
HIT ME IN THE HEAD.

30:45.470 --> 30:48.473
IT'S RIGHT AFTER I FOUND
DR. ELLIOT DEAD IN HIS OFFICE.

30:48.510 --> 30:50.501
- DR. ELLIOT'S NOT DEAD.

30:50.540 --> 30:52.542
HE'S NOT EVEN IN HIS OFFICE.
HE MUST BE AT LUNCH.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.275
- WHAT?
NO.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.878
NO, NO, NO.
THAT CAN'T BE.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.115
I-I-I SAW HIM.
HE WAS BASHED OVER THE HEAD.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.879
IT WAS--IT WAS UGLY.
WHY...?

30:59.920 --> 31:01.956
- FIRST YOU WERE OBSERVED
TALKING TO A POTTED PLANT.

31:01.990 --> 31:04.254
NOW YOU'RE SEEING
DEAD HOSPITAL STAFF?

31:04.290 --> 31:06.383
I'M RECOMMENDING THAT
YOUR DIAGNOSIS BE CHANGED

31:06.430 --> 31:07.920
TO INCLUDE
PARANOID, DELUSIONAL.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.497
- PAR--NO!
NO, I'M NOT PARANOID.

31:10.530 --> 31:12.361
I'M NOT EVEN CRAZY.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.595
LOOK, LISTEN, MY REAL NAME
IS SHAWN SPENCER.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.131
OKAY?
I AM A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE

31:17.170 --> 31:19.229
WORKING UNDERCOVER
FOR THE S.B.P.D.

31:19.270 --> 31:21.033
- OH, REALLY?
- YES, REALLY.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.139
I'M HERE
WITH MY ASSOCIATE GUS.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.375
HE'S PRETENDING TO
BE AN ORDERLY NAMED SUGGS.

31:25.410 --> 31:27.275
- I SEE.
BUT HE'S PSYCHIC AS WELL?

31:27.310 --> 31:30.017
- NO, HE'S NOT PSY--
HE'S A PHARMACEUTICAL SALESMAN.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.348
BUT HE HELPS ME
SOLVE CRIMES, OKAY?

31:32.390 --> 31:33.482
OH, AND HE
DRIVES A BLUEBERRY.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.680
- OOH, HE DRIVES
A PIECE OF FRUIT.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.688
WELL, THAT'S VERY INTERESTING.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.688
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GET HIM
ON SOME STRONGER MEDS.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.254
- NO, NO, NO, NO, I--
[chuckles]

31:40.290 --> 31:41.996
GUS IS REAL, ALL RIGHT?
I'LL TAKE YOU TO HIM.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.999
HE'S PROBABLY FLIRTING
WITH THAT HOT CHICK, VIVIENNE.

31:45.030 --> 31:47.692
WHO, YOU KNOW, THINKS SHE'S
A PLUMBER NAMED FRANK SOMETIMES.

31:47.730 --> 31:49.698
- OKAY, WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP
YOU HERE A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

31:49.740 --> 31:51.958
- NO, NO, HEY!
YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO ME.

31:52.010 --> 31:54.103
CALL HENRY SPENCER
AT THE S.B.P.D!

31:54.140 --> 31:56.131
[door slams]
HE'LL CONFIRM EVERYTHING!

31:56.180 --> 31:58.068
GET ME OUTTA HERE!

32:02.550 --> 32:04.245
- THANK YOU.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.609
KNOCK, KNOCK.

32:05.650 --> 32:08.687
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR MEETING,
MR. ZURN, MR. BETHEL.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.153
WE NEED TO ASK
A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT BERNIE.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.623
- QUESTIONS?
WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS?

32:11.660 --> 32:13.651
- MY GOD, HAS SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER?

32:13.690 --> 32:14.725
- NO, NO.
NO, HE'S FINE.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.422
ACTUALLY, HE'S INSANE.
OR NOT.

32:17.460 --> 32:18.666
IT'S HARD
TO TELL AT THIS POINT.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.737
- MR. ZURN, DID BETHEL TELL
YOU THAT HE HAD SEVERE ARTHRITIS

32:21.770 --> 32:24.261
IN HIS LEI-T HAND,
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE

32:24.310 --> 32:25.732
FOR HIM TO HAVE
STRANGLED SHEILA HANSON?

32:25.770 --> 32:27.431
- THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH BERNIE'S HAND?

32:27.470 --> 32:29.176
AND YOU KNEW ABOUT IT, AND YOU
DIDN'T BRING IT UP IN HIS TRIAL?

32:29.210 --> 32:30.700
- HE COMPLAINED
A LITTLE ABOUT IT.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.004
BUT BERNIE WAS ALWAYS
SUCH A COMPLAINER.

32:33.050 --> 32:35.018
HAD I REALIZED
HIS HAND WAS THAT BAD,

32:35.050 --> 32:36.677
I WOULD'VE GONE
FOR A NOT GUILTY VERDICT.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.585
- SO BASED ON WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, DETECT IVES,

32:38.620 --> 32:40.042
BERNIE MAY BE INNOCENT?

32:40.090 --> 32:43.582
- IT'S A...POSSIBILITY
WE'RE LOOKING INTO.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.451
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
WEREN'T MORE THOROUGH, PHILLIP.

32:45.490 --> 32:48.220
- I DID EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO SAVE BERNIE.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.091
- OBVIOUSLY, YOU DIDN'T.
I'M STARTING TO WONDER

32:50.130 --> 32:51.688
WHAT IT IS HE'S BEEN PAYING
YOU TO DO ALL THESE YEARS.

32:51.730 --> 32:53.721
- ALL TH ESE YEARS?

32:53.770 --> 32:55.169
HOW LONG'S BERNIE BEEN
A CLIENT?

32:55.200 --> 32:56.690
- HE'S HANDLED
ALL MY BROTHER'S BUSINESS

32:56.740 --> 32:59.709
AND LEGAL INTERESTS
FOR TEN YEARS.

32:59.740 --> 33:02.732
- MR. BETHEL, MAY I ASK YOU
TO GO OUTSIDE, PLEASE?

33:09.320 --> 33:12.016
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT ZURN
HANDLES ALL BERNIE'S AFFAIRS?

33:12.050 --> 33:13.540
- MY BROTHER'S
PHILLIP'S ONLY CLIENT.

33:13.590 --> 33:16.616
- STRANGE, YOU DON'T
NORMALLY EXPAND YOUR BUSINESS

33:16.660 --> 33:18.127
AI-TER LOSING YOUR ONLY CLIENT.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.151
- NOW THAT YOUR BROTHER'S
BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED,

33:20.190 --> 33:21.350
WHO CONTROLS HIS FORTUNE?

33:21.400 --> 33:24.221
- IT'S IN TRUST.

33:31.670 --> 33:32.659
- WHAT THE HELL?
THANK GOD!

33:32.710 --> 33:34.575
DUDE.
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

33:34.610 --> 33:36.168
- I WAS CLEANING OUT MY LOCKER
WHEN VIVIENNE SAW ME

33:36.210 --> 33:37.279
AND TOLD ME WHERE YOU WERE.

33:37.310 --> 33:39.141
WAIT, YOU ARE
STILL VIVIENNE, RIGHT?

33:39.180 --> 33:41.375
- WHO ELSE WOULD I BE, SILLY?
- JUST CHECKIN'.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.149
- YOU SEE ME
STRAPPED IN OVER HERE.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.681
- OH, YEAH.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.347
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU GOT FIRED?

33:46.390 --> 33:47.812
- YEAH.
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MAN!

33:47.850 --> 33:50.284
NOT MY JOB!
NOT MY JOB!"

33:50.320 --> 33:52.459
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.
- WELL, I HAVE EVEN WORSE NEWS.

33:52.490 --> 33:54.151
- WHAT'S THAT?
- DOC ELLIOT'S DEAD.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.622
- WHAT?
- HE WAS MURDERED.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.491
HE OBVIOUSLY WASN'T TAMPERING
WITH BETHEL'S MEDICATION,

33:57.530 --> 33:59.293
BUT HE MUST'VE KNOWN
WHO IN HERE WAS.

33:59.330 --> 34:00.820
AND WHEN HE CONFRONTED
THAT PERSON...

34:00.870 --> 34:04.499
THEY KILLED HIM
TO COVER UP THEIR TRACKS.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.132
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.309
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THEY DID WITH THE BODY,

34:08.340 --> 34:10.672
AND WE NEED TO GET TO BETHEL!

34:12.410 --> 34:14.344
OH, OH, HIDE.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.709
- WHERE'S HE TIAKING BETHEL?

34:22.760 --> 34:24.250
- ALL I KNOW IS
WHEN YOU COME BACK

34:24.290 --> 34:25.587
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME,

34:25.630 --> 34:27.450
MUCH LESS WHAT YOU'D
HAD FOR BREAKFAST THAT MORNING.

34:27.490 --> 34:28.650
- SECOND FLOOR.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.429
- THAT'S WHERE
THEY GIVE ELECTRIC SHOCK.

34:30.460 --> 34:31.563
- OH, NO, GUS.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.329
IF THEY PUMP BERNIE
WITH ENOUGH VOLTS,

34:33.370 --> 34:34.689
COULD THEY COMPLETELY
WIPE OUT HIS MEMORY?

34:34.740 --> 34:35.866
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.834
- THAT MEANS HE WON'T BE
ABLE TO SAY, MUCH LESS PROVE,

34:37.870 --> 34:39.337
THAT HE DIDN'T
KILL SHEILA HANSON.

34:39.370 --> 34:40.462
WE NEED TO HELP HIM.
- YEAH, WE NEED TO GET

34:40.510 --> 34:41.875
JULES AND LASSIE ON
THE PHONE ASAP.

34:41.910 --> 34:43.730
- COME ON, MAN, THEY'RE
NOT GONNA GET HERE IN TIME.

34:43.780 --> 34:45.748
WE NEED A DISTRACTION NOW.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.577
- I'VE GOT ONE.

34:47.610 --> 34:50.613
* HEY, COLLINS!

34:53.220 --> 34:54.653
- DUDE...

34:54.690 --> 34:56.089
FRANK IS STACKED.

34:58.390 --> 35:01.223
- JUST FOR THE RECORD,
I DID NOT ASK HER TO DO THAT.

35:01.260 --> 35:04.263
- WANNA HELP ME DO MY LAUNDRY?

35:07.370 --> 35:09.361
- DUDE, LET'S GO.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.508
- ALL RIGHT.
AS NEAR AS I CAN TELL,

35:12.540 --> 35:14.872
ZURN DOES NOT HAVE POWER OF
ATTORNEY OVER BETHEL'S TRUST.

35:14.910 --> 35:16.605
- SO THESE OFFICE IMPROVEMENTS

35:16.640 --> 35:18.699
ARE NOT COMING OUT
OF BERNIE'S BANK ACCOUNT.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.547
- UNLESS HE MADE
ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS COHORT

35:20.580 --> 35:22.309
INSIDE THE HOSPITAL TO
BE THE ONE SIGNING THE CHECKS.

35:22.350 --> 35:24.545
- THE COHORT WHO WAS
TAMPERING WITH BETHEL'S PILLS

35:24.590 --> 35:25.887
TO KEEP HIM UNSTABLE.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.387
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE WITH DR. ELLIOT?

35:27.420 --> 35:29.854
- SIX HOURS AGO.
AND I JUST CHECKED MY MESSAGES,

35:29.890 --> 35:32.586
THERE WAS NOTHING FROM ELLIOT.
SHAWN WAS GOING TO TALK TO HIM.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.257
DO YOU THINK
HE'S ZURN'S INSIDER?

35:34.300 --> 35:35.653
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.292
IF HE IS,
HE COULD BE DANGEROUS.

35:37.330 --> 35:39.195
[phone ringing]
MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT,

35:39.230 --> 35:40.868
IT'S TIME TO GET SPENCER
OUT OF THE LOONEY BIN.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.437
- HELLO?

35:43.470 --> 35:44.869
RIGHT.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.832
OKAY.

35:46.870 --> 35:48.428
THAT WAS THE MENTAL HOSPITAL.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.347
SHAWN JUST BROKE BETHEL OUT.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.506
- THAT'S YOUR BOYFRIEND.

35:52.550 --> 35:54.711
- I KNOW.

36:00.590 --> 36:01.614
[phone ringing]

36:01.660 --> 36:03.616
- HELLO, BURTON GUSTER.

36:03.660 --> 36:05.878
- GUS, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

36:05.930 --> 36:09.559
- HOLD ON, JULIET.
- AH.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.465
HEY, JULES.
- WHERE ARE YOU?

36:11.500 --> 36:13.821
- WHAT, WE'VE
STOPPED FOR SMOOTHIES.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.963
TH REE PIN EAPPLE
RAZZMATAZZ'S,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.901
AND A SANITY BOOST
FOR MY BUDDY OVER THERE.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.362
I DON'T HAVE
ANY AMERICAN DOLLARS.

36:20.410 --> 36:21.809
- SHAWN, WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

36:21.840 --> 36:24.445
YOU BROKE A CONVICTED MURDERER
OUT OF A MENTAL INSTITUTION.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.640
- SPENCER...

36:25.680 --> 36:27.568
[chuckles]
OH, MAN.

36:27.610 --> 36:30.317
I AM GONNA RELISH WATCHING YOU
STRUNG UP FOR THIS ONE.

36:30.350 --> 36:32.739
BUT RIGHT NOW
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.417
O'HARA AND I THINK THAT
BETHEL'S ATTORNEY'S THE ONE

36:34.460 --> 36:36.553
WORKING WITH THE INSIDER
TO TAMPER WITH BETHEL'S MEDS.

36:36.590 --> 36:38.558
- WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
IT ISN'T DR. ELLIOT.

36:38.590 --> 36:39.852
HE'S DEAD.
MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

36:39.890 --> 36:41.755
- WHAT?
ELLIOT'S DEAD.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.360
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW WHO THE INSIDER IS.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.424
- WHO IS IT?

36:45.470 --> 36:48.439
- MATTER OF FACT,
WE'RE HEADED THERE RIGHT NOW.

37:05.420 --> 37:08.389
HELLO, MCELROY.

37:08.420 --> 37:13.357
- WE'RE GIVING THE ORDERS NOW.

37:13.390 --> 37:14.994
- IT'S TIME FOR GROUP THERAPY.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.630
- I'D LIKE TO START
TODAY'S SESSION BY INTRODUCING

37:21.670 --> 37:23.638
THE NEWEST MEMgFlR OF OUR GROUP.

37:23.670 --> 37:27.003
- MISS LAVENDER MCELROY.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.928
LAVEN DER?
REALLY?

37:28.980 --> 37:30.299
- MY PARENTS WERE HIPPIES.

37:30.340 --> 37:32.376
- EVIL HIPPIES.
- AREN'T THEY ALL?

37:32.410 --> 37:34.344
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.
- ALWAYS SETTING STUFF ON FIRE.

37:34.380 --> 37:36.416
- "ACCIDENTALLY."
- SO TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF,

37:36.450 --> 37:37.917
LAVENDER.

37:37.950 --> 37:40.839
MORE SPECIFICALLY, HOW
YOU WERE PAID BY PHILLIP ZURN

37:40.890 --> 37:42.983
TO ALTER BllE/IwIE'S MEDS.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.580
- MAYBE HOW DR. ELLIOT
FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,

37:45.630 --> 37:46.824
AND YOU KILLED HIM.

37:46.860 --> 37:48.691
OR THAT YOU SIGNED THE ORDER

37:48.730 --> 37:50.925
TO SEND BERNIE HERE
THROUGH ELECT ROSHOCK THERAPY

37:50.960 --> 37:53.019
TO ZAP HIS MEMORY.
- OKAY, I ADMIT

37:53.070 --> 37:55.061
THAT I WAS PAID TO CHANGE
BERNIE'S DOSAGE

37:55.100 --> 37:58.035
AND TO GIVE HIM E.C.T.,
BUT I DID NOT KILL DR. ELLIOT.

37:58.070 --> 37:59.708
I SWEAR.

37:59.740 --> 38:01.503
AND AS FAR AS
THIS ZURN PERSON GOES....

38:01.540 --> 38:02.632
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HIM.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.979
- THEN WHO ARE YOU WORKING FOR?

38:06.010 --> 38:07.898
- HERE'S BETHEL'S BROTHER,
DANIEL,

38:07.950 --> 38:08.917
JUST OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE...

38:08.950 --> 38:11.043
- I WANTED TO EXPRESS
MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES

38:11.080 --> 38:12.047
TO THE HANSON FAMILY.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.580
DON'T WORRY, BERNIE,

38:13.620 --> 38:15.611
I'M GONNA KEEP
CHECKING ON YOU EVERY WEEK.

38:15.660 --> 38:16.718
- GUS...

38:16.760 --> 38:17.784
- WHAT?

38:17.820 --> 38:19.959
- BERNIE WAS NEVER FAKING.
- WHAT?

38:19.990 --> 38:21.696
- HIS BROTHER DANIEL WAS.

38:21.730 --> 38:23.891
HE WAS JUST PRETENDING
TO FEEL SORRY FOR THE VICTIMS.

38:23.930 --> 38:25.488
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[gun cocking]

38:25.530 --> 38:27.066
- YOU TWO SHOULD'VE
STAYED AT THE HOSPITAL.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.089
- HOW THE HELL DID HE GET IN?

38:28.130 --> 38:29.734
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO CHECK THE HOUSE, SHAWN.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.032
- I WASN'T CHECKING THE HOUSE.

38:31.070 --> 38:32.867
YOU KNEW I WAS WAITING OVER
THERE TO SCARE HERE.

38:32.910 --> 38:33.934
- IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

38:33.970 --> 38:36.632
- WELL, NOW I CAN SEE IT ALL.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.807
YOUNGER, MUCH LESS
SUCCESSFUL SIBLING,

38:38.850 --> 38:41.478
COVETS HIS
BIG BRO'S GAZILLIONS.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.875
IN BERNIE'S ADDLED STATE,
YOU CONVINCED HIM

38:43.920 --> 38:45.046
TO LET YOU
HAVE POWER OF ATTORNEY.

38:45.090 --> 38:48.048
BUT THEN HIS GIRLFRIEND,
SHEILA HANSON, FIGURED THAT OUT,

38:48.090 --> 38:50.957
AND YOU KILLED HER...

38:50.990 --> 38:52.924
- [choking]

38:52.960 --> 38:55.121
- AND PINNED IT ON POOR BERNIE.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.821
AND EVERYTHING WAS
GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN,

38:56.860 --> 38:59.090
UNTIL YOUR COHORT,
LAVENDER HERE,

38:59.130 --> 39:01.963
TOLD YOU THAT HIS MEDS
WERE MAKING HIM SANE.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.560
SO YOU HAD HER SWITCH IT UP.
AND THEN DR. ELLIOT FOUND OUT,

39:04.610 --> 39:06.066
AND THREATENED
TO GO TO THE POLICE.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.032
- GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY OFFICE RIGHT NOW!

39:08.070 --> 39:09.435
GET OUT!
[loud thud]

39:09.480 --> 39:10.799
UGH!
- AND THEN YOU KILLED HIM.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.104
[another loud thud]
- [grunt]

39:13.150 --> 39:14.947
I NEVER WANTED
TO HURT MY BROTHER.

39:14.980 --> 39:17.517
BUT NOW, THANKS TO YOU,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO.

39:17.550 --> 39:19.780
EVERYBODY IN THE CORNER.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.651
- I KNEW.
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

39:21.690 --> 39:23.385
- I KNEW.
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT, SHAWN.

39:24.790 --> 39:26.621
- NO!
NO, PLEASE!

39:26.660 --> 39:29.128
PLEASE, DON'T!

39:29.160 --> 39:31.094
- HE'S GOT A WHOLE BUNCH
OF PHOBIAS FOR HIMSELF.

39:31.130 --> 39:33.519
FEAR OF LOUD NOISES, FEAR
OF CROWDS, FEAR OF SAXOPHONES.

39:33.570 --> 39:37.666
- PLEASE, DON'T!

39:37.700 --> 39:39.804
[Kenny G.'s Songbird plays]
- NO!

39:39.840 --> 39:41.535
NO!

39:41.580 --> 39:43.400
- BERNIE, SHUT UP.
SHUT UP!

39:43.440 --> 39:45.579
- MAKE IT STOP!
UGH! NO!

39:45.610 --> 39:46.645
[saxophone music]
NO!

39:46.680 --> 39:48.511
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP?
- NO, NO!

39:48.550 --> 39:50.643
MAKE HIM STOP!
MAKE HIM STOP!

39:50.680 --> 39:54.081
*
[fighting continues]

39:54.120 --> 39:58.011
- [grunts]

39:58.060 --> 39:59.721
- DON'T MOVE!
- TURN IT OFF!

39:59.760 --> 40:00.920
- ALL RIGHT, BERNIE,
ALL RIGHT.

40:00.960 --> 40:01.756
- TURN IT OFF!

40:01.800 --> 40:02.949
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NOT YET, SHAWN.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.194
MY FAVORITE PART IS COMING UP.

40:04.230 --> 40:06.425
- WHAT?
- TURN IT OFF!

40:06.470 --> 40:08.199
- WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME?
THAT YOU'RE A KENNY G. FAN?

40:08.230 --> 40:10.198
- A LITTLE BIT, YES.
THIS SONG.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.003
- I GOTTA BE HONEST, I'VE NEVER
MINDED THIS SONG EITHER.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.530
- SO YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

40:13.570 --> 40:15.674
- IT'S REALLY, REALLY SMOOTH.
- GROOVE TO IT, SHAWN.

40:15.710 --> 40:17.439
- I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT GROOVING, GUS.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.674
- MAKE IT STOP!

40:18.710 --> 40:20.439
AH!

40:20.480 --> 40:22.118
[loud thud]

40:22.150 --> 40:24.118
TURN IT OFF!
TURN IT OFF!

40:24.150 --> 40:26.448
- OOH, OOH.

40:26.490 --> 40:33.225
- OH, YEAH.
- TURN IT OFF!

40:33.260 --> 40:34.989
- I'M SORRY
YOU'RE LEAVING, GUS.

40:35.030 --> 40:36.657
- IT'S OKAY, VIV.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.759
AT LEAST YOUR MEDICATION'S
FINALLY WORKING.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.859
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER.
- THEY SAY I WAS SUFFERING

40:40.900 --> 40:42.868
FROM MULTIPLE
PERSONALITY DISORDER,

40:42.900 --> 40:44.936
AND SOMETIMES
I THOUGHT I WAS A MAN.

40:44.970 --> 40:47.006
- YEP.
HIS NAME WAS FRANK.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.008
A WAR VETERAN.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.701
GOOD GUY.

40:50.740 --> 40:53.004
- SHAWN...
I WAN NA THANK YOU

40:53.050 --> 40:54.938
FOR EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

40:54.980 --> 40:58.040
YOU TOO, DETECT IVES.
BOTH OF YOU, THANK YOU.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.980
- WELL, WE'VE GOT MORE
GOOD NEWS, BERNIE.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.749
BUT SINCE
THIS IS LASSIE'S CASE,

41:01.790 --> 41:03.610
I'M GONNA
LET HIM DO THE HONORS.

41:03.660 --> 41:05.753
- YOUR SENTENCE
HAS BEEN REPEALED.

41:05.790 --> 41:08.725
AND YOU'RE FINALLY
GONNA GET THE CARE YOU NEED.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.920
- [sighs]
THANK YOU.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.689
- YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NO REASON TO THANK ME

41:11.730 --> 41:13.698
FOR HELPING YOU
SOLVE THIS CASE, LASSIE.

41:13.730 --> 41:15.630
BUT NOW WOULD BE
A GREAT TIME TO THANK ME.

41:15.670 --> 41:17.661
- SPENCER, IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR RECOGNITION

41:17.700 --> 41:19.634
JUST DO WHAT NORMAL PEOPLE DO
AND TH ROW YOURSELF A PARTY.

41:19.670 --> 41:21.001
- OH, I SHALL.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.507
AND THIS TIME
THERE WILL BE A PONY.

41:22.540 --> 41:25.247
- YOU KNOW, I'M IN
NO HURRY TO LEAVE THIS PLACE.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.248
IT'S NICE HERE.

41:27.280 --> 41:30.477
LIFE IS SIMPLE.
DON'T YOU THINK?

41:31.690 --> 41:33.180
- IT REALLY IS,
ISN'T IT, BERNIE?

41:33.220 --> 41:35.017
- MM-HMM.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.288
- SHAWN.
- YEAH?

41:36.320 --> 41:38.880
- WE'RE GOING.
- OKAY.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.251
