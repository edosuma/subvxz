STEVE:All I'm saying is

01:17.660 --> 01:18.990
maybe consider it.
That's all.

01:18.990 --> 01:19.870
I have considered it.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.250
I've considered it,
and the answer's no.

01:21.250 --> 01:22.450
We're not having
gluten-free pasta,

01:22.450 --> 01:23.700
and we're not having
dairy-free cheese

01:23.700 --> 01:24.830
at our restaurant.
That's it.
Danny,

01:24.830 --> 01:26.580
these days, a lot of people
have food allergies.
Uh-huh.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.450
Okay, what are they gonna eat
when they come to our place?

01:28.450 --> 01:29.990
I don't care what they eat.
They can have water.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.620
If they don't like it,
they can go somewhere else.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.330
You're impossible. Junior, what
do you think about all this?

01:33.330 --> 01:35.990
All due respect, sir, I'm just
here to learn and observe.

01:35.990 --> 01:36.990
Why would you
ask Switzerland?

01:36.990 --> 01:40.120
No, he's being polite.
He knows I'm right.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.990
Hoh.

01:42.790 --> 01:44.120
Jerry.

01:44.660 --> 01:45.990
Dude, I love it.

01:45.990 --> 01:46.790
Thanks.

01:46.790 --> 01:47.500
DANNY:
Look at this guy.

01:47.500 --> 01:51.990
Is this, uh, 'cause you joined
that new dating Web site?

01:51.990 --> 01:52.990
Coincidence.

01:52.990 --> 01:54.330
Okay, here's what we know.

01:54.330 --> 01:55.990
At approximately 8:30
this morning,

01:55.990 --> 01:58.990
a woman was spotted
clinging to a life raft

01:58.990 --> 02:01.200
roughly 200 yards
off Waikiki Beach.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.990
Coast Guard was alerted.
They came.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.870
They found her unresponsive
and dehydrated.

02:04.870 --> 02:07.750
She's at King's Medical
Center right now.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.990
She's stable,
but still unconscious.

02:09.990 --> 02:12.040
Right, and based on the level
of dehydration and exposure,

02:12.040 --> 02:14.120
the doctors say she's been
out on open water

02:14.120 --> 02:15.200
for at least eight hours.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.950
Okay. We got an I.D.?

02:16.950 --> 02:18.990
Uh, Monique Sims.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.540
She owns a PR firm
here on the Island.

02:21.540 --> 02:22.660
She's a familiar face

02:22.660 --> 02:23.580
on the Island's
social scene.

02:23.580 --> 02:25.990
In fact, she seems to be
an acquaintance

02:25.990 --> 02:28.250
of our very own Adam Noshimuri.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.620
They were both
on the board of trustees

02:30.620 --> 02:31.990
for the New Art Institute
of Honolulu together.

02:31.990 --> 02:34.990
Let's give Adam a call, see
what he can tell us about her.

02:34.990 --> 02:35.990
DANNY:
Okay, so...

02:35.990 --> 02:36.910
lady puts on
a fancy dress,

02:36.910 --> 02:39.540
goes to a fancy party
out at sea, fancy boat.

02:39.540 --> 02:40.080
Everything's good.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.410
Then something
not so fancy goes down

02:41.410 --> 02:43.370
and she takes off
in a life raft.

02:43.370 --> 02:44.410
What about a distress call?

02:44.410 --> 02:47.500
According to the Coast Guard,
nothing's been reported yet.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.990
Hi.
Hi.

02:48.990 --> 02:49.580
Oh, hello.

02:49.580 --> 02:52.660
Does this mean I finally
have seniority over someone?

02:52.660 --> 02:55.250
Not quite. Junior's just
shadowing us for the week.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.000
Oh. Oh, well.
Okay, I'll get over it,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.040
as long as we can
haze him lightly.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.990
Anyway, I just got off the phone
with Monique's assistant

03:02.990 --> 03:06.040
and yesterday, she was a guest
on a boat called theSerenity.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.660
The owner is someone named
Nathan Diamond.

03:08.660 --> 03:09.700
He's a big hedge fund guy.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.250
JERRY:
That's him.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.450
I have a call in to his people,

03:12.450 --> 03:14.450
and they're gonna get back
to me with a list

03:14.450 --> 03:16.000
of everyone
who was on the yacht.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.370
What are you doing?

03:17.370 --> 03:19.200
Every boating vessel's
registered in a database.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.660
I'm pulling up the ship to shore
comms channel for theSerenity.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.750
NSerenity,this is
Commander McGarrett

03:25.750 --> 03:28.990
of the Five-O Task Force.
Please respond. Over.

03:28.990 --> 03:31.500
(static over comms)

03:31.500 --> 03:33.040
That's not good.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.120

Commander McGarrett.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.700
Respond. Over.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.790
You know, you can use
the radio frequency

03:40.790 --> 03:42.790
to triangulate
a position.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.410
He's right. Jerry, try that.
Mm-hmm.

03:46.450 --> 03:49.330
JERRY: All right.
Pulling up the sat feed now.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.250
Right. Punch in.

03:53.540 --> 03:54.830
Oh, my God.

03:57.990 --> 04:01.580
Well, that explains why
they didn't respond.

04:01.580 --> 04:03.540
Call the Coast Guard.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.990
You okay?

04:17.910 --> 04:19.620
You know, I-I used
to be terrified

04:19.620 --> 04:20.870
flying in these
things, too.

04:20.870 --> 04:22.410
But statistically
speaking,

04:22.410 --> 04:25.870
flying is-is a lot safer
than driving.

04:25.870 --> 04:26.990
That's only true for planes.

04:26.990 --> 04:29.250
These things are actually
more dangerous than cars.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.450
Based on hours, you're about
85 times more likely to die

04:32.450 --> 04:33.370
in a helicopter.

04:33.370 --> 04:34.910
Who told you that?

04:34.910 --> 04:35.750
Google.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.990
Steve, how come
you never told me that?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.660
Ma'am, just try
to relax, okay?

04:42.660 --> 04:45.660
Keeping your body stiff can make
you feel a little bit dizzy,

04:45.660 --> 04:47.870
so move your head
as little as possible.

04:47.870 --> 04:48.540
Focus on the horizon.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.990
And if you feel nauseous,
just don't look down.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.200
You'll be all right.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.000
PILOT: Commander, we have visual
contact of theSerenity.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.660
Two minutes out.

04:56.660 --> 04:57.660
Roger that.

04:57.660 --> 04:58.790
We'll rope down,
secure the scene,

04:58.790 --> 05:00.990
and then bring Noelani
aboard to process.

05:00.990 --> 05:03.370
PILOT: Roger.
STEVE: Let's gear up, guys.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.580
All right,

We got multiple vics.
They're all showing signs

hemorrhagic virus or pathogen.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, slow down.

07:01.400 --> 07:05.890
Are you telling me that you guys
were exposed to this thing, too?

07:05.890 --> 07:07.890
Yes, which is why we're staying
put right now, okay?

07:07.890 --> 07:10.890
Our primary focus needs to be
keeping this thing contained,

07:10.890 --> 07:12.890
which is gonna start with you
making that call, Lou.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.980
I'm on it. I'm on it.
I'm also gonna contact the CDC.

07:15.980 --> 07:18.100
I'm gonna give them
your coordinates to get

07:18.100 --> 07:19.270
a team out to you ASAP.

07:19.270 --> 07:19.890
Good. Good idea.

07:19.890 --> 07:21.890
Steve, there's something
you should know.

07:21.890 --> 07:24.310
I've been looking
into that boat's movements.

07:24.310 --> 07:25.690
It only left port 23 hours ago.

07:25.690 --> 07:26.890
So whatever that pathogen is,

07:26.890 --> 07:29.350
it's real fast-acting.

07:29.350 --> 07:30.890
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

07:30.890 --> 07:32.900
If I can get this boat moving,
we can plot a course

07:32.900 --> 07:37.560
to intercept the CDC team,
cut our rendezvous time in half.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.400
(ignition sputtering)

07:43.890 --> 07:46.890

07:57.150 --> 07:58.890
How long can you
maintain position

07:58.890 --> 08:00.520
based on your current fuel load?

08:00.520 --> 08:03.770
We got about eight minutes
before we need to RTB.

08:03.770 --> 08:06.560
Copy that, Air One. Stand by.

08:07.890 --> 08:12.150
We got eight minutes before
the helo has to head back.

08:12.150 --> 08:15.150
Should I secure
the lines for extraction?

08:15.150 --> 08:15.890
No, change of plan.

08:15.890 --> 08:17.770
We're not getting back

08:17.770 --> 08:19.890
What are you talking about,
we're not going back

08:19.890 --> 08:21.480
on the chopper?
What are you saying?

08:21.480 --> 08:22.690
STEVE:
It's too late, Danny.

08:22.690 --> 08:23.890
All these people were killed

08:23.890 --> 08:26.520
by some kind of
extremely virulent bio-agent.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.270
Until we know what
we're dealing with,

08:28.270 --> 08:30.150
we can't risk exposing
anybody else.

08:30.150 --> 08:31.190
I can't tell.

08:31.190 --> 08:32.980
Is he for real right now?
DANNY: Yes, he's for...

What's the matter with you?
What are you, nuts?

08:35.310 --> 08:37.940

feel right now.

08:37.940 --> 08:38.480
You don't.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.350
I do. I do.
Every instinct in my body

08:40.350 --> 08:42.730
is telling me to get off
this boat and save myself.

08:42.730 --> 08:43.980
It's not an option, all right?

08:43.980 --> 08:44.890
CDC knows we're here.

08:44.890 --> 08:47.850
They're sending
a unit as we speak.

08:47.850 --> 08:48.650
It's got to be enough for now.

08:48.650 --> 08:50.770
Meanwhile, in the next eight
minutes, we need to collect

08:50.770 --> 08:53.600
as much evidence as we can
to send back with that helo.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.650
All right, so let's get to work.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.440
What's he doing?

08:59.440 --> 09:01.600
He's probably gonna eat
the body. I don't know.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.690
I'm gonna take a tissue sample.
We're gonna send it up

09:03.690 --> 09:06.020
to the chopper, who are gonna
take it back to the lab.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.060
They're gonna identify
this virus.

09:08.060 --> 09:09.400
Hopefully, there's an antidote.

10:08.510 --> 10:10.600
Uh, nobody has any
cell phones on them,

10:10.600 --> 10:13.550

that's been shot.

10:13.550 --> 10:14.850

But the fuse was stripped

10:14.850 --> 10:16.090

No cell phones up there either.

10:20.090 --> 10:22.640
confiscated all the cell phones,
sabotaged the radio,

10:22.640 --> 10:25.800
exposed everybody to the virus,
and got off this boat, and what?

10:25.800 --> 10:28.930
They must've rendezvoused
with another vessel, right?

10:28.930 --> 10:32.050

10:36.090 --> 10:38.090
Viruses are
notoriously unstable,

so, if the goal here was
to kill a bunch of people,

10:41.010 --> 10:42.390
there's much easier
ways of doing it.

10:42.390 --> 10:43.850
Yeah, like
shooting everybody

10:43.850 --> 10:45.090
and throwing the gun overboard.

10:45.090 --> 10:47.300

overly complicated.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.180
Wait a minute. What if this
was some kind of test?

10:50.180 --> 10:51.090
What kind of test?

10:51.090 --> 10:54.090
Like a test of the bioweapon.
Right? I mean, think about it.

10:54.090 --> 10:57.510
You got a bunch of people here
in a controlled environment

10:57.510 --> 10:59.100
far away from prying eyes.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.430
You release the virus,

11:00.430 --> 11:03.760
you bail long before
the boat's even discovered.

11:07.090 --> 11:08.640
Commander,
we're reaching critical fuel.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.090
We need to head back right now.

11:10.090 --> 11:11.010
Roger that.

11:11.010 --> 11:11.850
NOELANI: Package is secure.

11:11.850 --> 11:13.890
I'll get these samples
back to the lab.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.720
You guys take care down there.
Over.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.140
STEVE:
All right, copy that.

11:17.140 --> 11:19.550
Thanks, Noelani. Over and out.

11:44.090 --> 11:45.090
TANI: All right,
so what do we do now--

11:45.090 --> 11:47.930
just sit around
and try not to die?

11:48.090 --> 11:49.090
These bodies are all evidence.

11:49.090 --> 11:50.090
We need to get 'em
out of the sun.

11:50.090 --> 11:53.970
Get 'em below deck somewhere,
Danny.

11:53.970 --> 11:55.850
(elevator bell chimes)

11:55.850 --> 11:57.090
Man, thanks for coming down.

11:57.090 --> 11:57.800
Of course. Any news?

11:57.800 --> 12:00.090
Well, I just got off the
phone with McGarrett.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.510
They're holding up, but...

12:01.510 --> 12:04.090
I mean, all we can do is sit
around, wait for the CDC

12:04.090 --> 12:06.800
to figure out exactly what
the hell they were exposed to.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.100
Adam, hey. So, we got
a list of everyone

12:09.100 --> 12:10.090
who attended this yacht party,

12:10.090 --> 12:12.090
and based on the pictures
that our guys sent back,

12:12.090 --> 12:13.140
it looks like
all of them are dead.

12:13.140 --> 12:15.050
GROVER:
Except your girl Monique,

12:15.050 --> 12:16.090
who is now in ICU.

12:16.090 --> 12:18.300
JERRY: Right. Anyway,
I ran everyone through

12:18.300 --> 12:20.090
our usual databases,
and nothing popped.

12:20.090 --> 12:21.600
Look, since you know Monique,

12:21.600 --> 12:25.260
we were hoping that maybe you'd
recognize some of these people,

12:25.260 --> 12:26.600
maybe be able to tell us

12:26.600 --> 12:29.090
a little bit
about them?

12:35.720 --> 12:36.640
Uh, sorry.
(phone ringing)

12:36.640 --> 12:39.600
It's been a while
since I was part of that scene.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.140
Yeah?

12:41.140 --> 12:43.640
Good. Thank you.
We'll be right down.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.890
Adam, we need to take a ride.
That was the CDC.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.680
Monique's just
regained consciousness.

12:52.740 --> 12:55.040
We've got 22 people
under observation.

12:55.140 --> 12:57.590
All of them came into contact
with Monique Sims

12:57.590 --> 12:59.590
after she was pulled out
of the water.

12:59.590 --> 13:02.590
Tests are ongoing,
but thankfully, at the moment,

13:02.590 --> 13:03.590
no one is symptomatic.

13:03.590 --> 13:05.430
And that includes
Monique herself.

13:05.430 --> 13:06.930
ADAM:
So she wasn't exposed?

13:06.930 --> 13:08.550
She's alive, so no.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.590
Well, that must mean
she got off the boat

13:10.590 --> 13:11.970
before the virus
was released.

13:11.970 --> 13:15.640
The tissue sample you provided
is still being analyzed,

13:15.640 --> 13:16.970
but based on the pictures
of the victims,

13:16.970 --> 13:19.890
and the time
from exposure to death,

13:19.890 --> 13:21.140
this looks like a synthetic,

13:21.140 --> 13:23.760
genetically engineered
chimera virus.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.470
We're not doctors, so...

13:25.470 --> 13:28.680
It's a hybrid that combines
the pernicious qualities

13:28.680 --> 13:29.640
of two different viruses

13:29.640 --> 13:31.590
to create one
even more deadly pathogen.

13:31.590 --> 13:34.350
In this case,
the victims are exhibiting

13:34.350 --> 13:35.590
the symptoms and mortality rate

13:35.590 --> 13:38.890
of a hemorrhagic condition
like the Ebola Zaire virus,

13:38.890 --> 13:40.760
which has a 95%
fatality rate.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.800
But the R0 value,

13:41.800 --> 13:45.350
or the number of people infected
by one contagious person,

13:45.350 --> 13:47.720
has a virulence suggesting
this could've been combined

13:47.720 --> 13:50.590
with something highly
contagious, like measles.

13:50.590 --> 13:51.590
Bottom line,

13:51.590 --> 13:53.350
anyone infected will be dead

13:53.350 --> 13:54.850
within eight to ten hours.

13:54.850 --> 13:57.600
Please tell me
there's a cure for this.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.010
Unless an antidote
already exists,

14:01.010 --> 14:03.260
and we have no record of one,

14:03.260 --> 14:05.260
we'll need
to synthesize something.

14:05.260 --> 14:07.550
But with an exotic virus
like this,

14:07.550 --> 14:08.680
that will take some time.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.970
What are we talking? Hours?

14:10.970 --> 14:12.800
Months.

14:13.680 --> 14:14.970
We don't have that kind of time.

14:14.970 --> 14:17.260
My team is on that boat.

14:18.970 --> 14:21.720
GROVER:Monique, I need you to tell me

14:21.720 --> 14:24.100
everything that you saw
when you were on that boat.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.350
Anything that you can remember.

14:27.010 --> 14:29.590
Um...

14:29.590 --> 14:31.100
I was there

14:31.100 --> 14:32.600
as a guest of my friend Nathan.

14:32.600 --> 14:37.350
He does these parties
on his yacht every month or so.

14:37.350 --> 14:40.100
It's just a bunch
of rich people,

14:40.100 --> 14:43.260
blowing off steam,
drinking champagne, dancing.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.930
It's a good networking
opportunity for me,

14:45.930 --> 14:48.220
so I try to go when I can.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.930
The party was good as usual,

14:49.930 --> 14:52.680
but at around 10:00 p.m.,
I just, I got this

14:52.680 --> 14:54.180
pounding headache, so,

14:54.180 --> 14:57.800
I went into my cabin
to lie down.

14:57.800 --> 15:01.680
I must have been asleep
for a couple of hours.

15:01.680 --> 15:02.590
(thumping, shouting in distance)

15:02.590 --> 15:04.760
I was woken up
by this shouting,

15:04.760 --> 15:09.640
some... some kind of commotion
up on deck.

15:10.180 --> 15:12.600
So I stepped out of my cabin,

15:12.600 --> 15:16.510
and I see Marko standing there,

15:16.510 --> 15:19.590
holding a gun on the others.

15:19.590 --> 15:20.300
Marko?

15:20.300 --> 15:21.590
We I.D.'d everybody

15:21.590 --> 15:23.100
on that boat.
This is the first time

15:23.100 --> 15:24.510
I'm hearing that name.

15:24.510 --> 15:25.680
He got dropped off
by another boat

15:25.680 --> 15:27.590
several hours into our trip.

15:27.590 --> 15:30.890
Okay. So who is this
Marko person?

15:30.890 --> 15:33.300
Apparently, he and Nathan

15:33.300 --> 15:35.970
were old friends.
That's all I know.

15:35.970 --> 15:39.590
I-I wasn't around him much
at the party.

15:39.590 --> 15:40.720
He kind of kept to himself.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.720
He... seemed a little odd.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.050
But...

15:44.050 --> 15:45.850
when I saw that gun...

15:45.850 --> 15:48.850
I-I wasn't gonna wait around
to see what was going down.

15:48.850 --> 15:51.930
I-I just... I had to get
the hell out of there.

15:51.930 --> 15:53.970
I got onto that
life raft,

15:53.970 --> 15:55.220
and...

15:55.220 --> 15:58.390
I-I must've been
paddling for hours.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.010
Passed out.

16:00.010 --> 16:04.590
The next thing I know,
I'm waking up here.

16:04.590 --> 16:05.590
Monique,

16:05.590 --> 16:09.050
was anyone on board
that boat sick?

16:09.050 --> 16:10.590
What do you mean?

16:10.590 --> 16:12.390
Did you see anybody
who looked pale,

16:12.390 --> 16:16.590
or was complaining
about excessive pain?

16:16.590 --> 16:17.800
I don't know.

16:17.800 --> 16:22.590
Uh, I mean, they looked scared,
because Marko had a gun.

16:22.590 --> 16:25.590
I assumed he was
there to rob us.

16:25.590 --> 16:27.220
I wasn't gonna
stick around to see

16:27.220 --> 16:30.550
if he was gonna kill us, too.

16:30.590 --> 16:34.590
Yeah, Monique is still currently
under observation, but so far,

16:34.590 --> 16:35.590
there's been no infection.

16:35.590 --> 16:37.140
Well, then, she-she couldn't
have been exposed.

16:37.140 --> 16:39.550
If she was exposed,
she'd be dead by now.

16:39.550 --> 16:41.720
That's right.
She definitely got off that boat

16:41.720 --> 16:42.760
before the virus was released.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.590
Look, I'm gonna go out
on a limb,

16:44.590 --> 16:47.590
and say that this guy Marko,
whoever the hell he is,

16:47.590 --> 16:49.850
he's the one that released
that virus on board.

16:49.850 --> 16:53.390
Which begs the question now:
where the hell is he?

16:53.390 --> 16:56.680
Monique got away
on the only life raft.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.260
Well, I can think
of two possibilities.

16:58.260 --> 16:59.430
One, he gets
one of his accomplices

16:59.430 --> 17:02.590
to meet him at sea, the other is
that the hostages overpower him,

17:02.590 --> 17:03.390
throw him overboard.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.390
Yeah, well, I got
another scenario for you

17:05.390 --> 17:06.390
that you're missing, chief.

17:06.390 --> 17:09.590
The one where the guy's
still on the boat.

17:09.590 --> 17:12.590
I mean, h-how thoroughly
did you guys search it?

17:35.010 --> 17:37.350
(grunts)

18:04.890 --> 18:07.430
I found Marko!

18:24.930 --> 18:26.590
T-That looks, to me,

18:26.590 --> 18:29.140
like that was accidentally
broken, that vial.

18:29.140 --> 18:32.180
The boat was due back at port
this morning, right?

18:32.180 --> 18:32.800
And there's enough

18:32.800 --> 18:34.970
of this virus to kill
a lot of people.

18:34.970 --> 18:37.590
So maybe Marko was trying
to sneak it onto the Island.

18:37.590 --> 18:40.760
I mean, releasing it there
would maximize casualties.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.970
Right. And then,
things go sideways,

18:42.970 --> 18:45.590
the virus is accidentally
released,

18:45.590 --> 18:46.720
everybody gets infected,

18:46.720 --> 18:47.760
and they turn on him.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.590
Okay. But this guy does not look
like he died from the virus.

18:50.590 --> 18:53.100
He looks like his head
was blown off with a grenade.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.180
Those look
like chemical burns to me.

18:54.180 --> 18:57.640
You said you found a flare gun
that had been discharged.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.590
I think we know
what those burns are from.

18:59.590 --> 19:01.300
This was payback for
what he did to them.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.760
MAN: Why are we sick?
WOMAN: What have you done to us?

19:03.760 --> 19:05.600
This guy didn't die
from the virus.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.100
Which means he had immunity
to the virus.

19:08.100 --> 19:11.930
That means that there's got
to be some kind of vaccine

19:11.930 --> 19:13.600
or antidote out there.

19:32.590 --> 19:34.760
DANNY:
Nothing on him.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.970
(Tani sighs)

19:37.760 --> 19:39.260
Well, it was beautiful,

19:39.260 --> 19:44.050
that one small moment of hope
that we had.

19:58.550 --> 19:59.760
Here.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.800
Thanks.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.800
And drink this.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.590
You need to stay hydrated.

20:05.590 --> 20:07.930
Okay.

20:15.590 --> 20:16.590
What?

20:16.590 --> 20:17.850
How do you do it?

20:17.850 --> 20:18.640
Do what?

20:18.640 --> 20:22.760
How do you stay so calm?

20:24.590 --> 20:26.640
You know, we're...

20:26.640 --> 20:28.930
we're probably
gonna die here.

20:29.590 --> 20:31.970
"Probably"? No.

20:31.970 --> 20:34.180
"Maybe"? Yeah.

20:34.180 --> 20:38.590
And that...
that doesn't bother you?

20:39.720 --> 20:41.850
Do you know, most recruits
in the SEAL Program

20:41.850 --> 20:44.930
don't quit BUD/S
in the middle of a test.

20:44.930 --> 20:47.430
They quit just before.

20:48.010 --> 20:48.720
You see, it's the fear

20:48.720 --> 20:50.220
of what they're about
to go through

20:50.220 --> 20:53.140
that makes them want
to throw in that towel.

20:54.510 --> 20:57.350
You see, the biggest
battle is in here.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.590
You're still walking,
and talking.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.640
And you can stand, right?

21:02.590 --> 21:03.220
See, all of that

21:03.220 --> 21:05.050
means that you're still
in the fight.

21:05.050 --> 21:07.590
And until you're not,
then you don't give up.

21:07.590 --> 21:10.220
And I won't let you give up.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.510
(footsteps approaching)

21:18.510 --> 21:20.720
(exhales)

21:23.260 --> 21:24.760
Hey.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.600
Hi.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.590
Any luck?

21:27.590 --> 21:29.180
Junior and I looked everywhere.

21:29.180 --> 21:30.930
There's no antidote
on this boat.

21:30.930 --> 21:33.590
Marko must have taken it
before he boarded.

21:33.590 --> 21:36.510
I'm gonna go ahead
and file that

21:36.510 --> 21:39.260
under the "really,
really bad news."

21:39.260 --> 21:40.510
Morebad news.

21:40.510 --> 21:41.590
How you holding up?

21:41.590 --> 21:47.100
Uh, what are the, uh, initial
signs of the virus again?

21:47.100 --> 21:49.220
Fever, muscle pain, dizziness.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.590
(tongue clicks)

21:50.590 --> 21:51.510
Yeah, I got all that.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.550
Check, check, check.
(phone ringing)

21:53.550 --> 21:56.140
Can you do something for me?

21:56.140 --> 21:57.590
(ringing continues)

21:57.590 --> 21:58.720
Yeah.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.890
Try not to die before
I'm off this call, okay?

22:01.890 --> 22:04.600
Okay.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.010
(sighs)

22:06.010 --> 22:07.430
Lou.

22:07.430 --> 22:09.180
All right, Steve, I
got Adam here with me.

22:09.180 --> 22:11.350
Come on, man, talk to us.
How you guys holding up?

22:11.350 --> 22:15.890
Well, we could really use some
good news right about now.

22:15.890 --> 22:18.220
ADAM: CDC are doing
everything they can

22:18.220 --> 22:19.510
to find an antidote.

22:19.510 --> 22:20.430
In the meantime,
we have a lead.

22:20.430 --> 22:22.430
Jerry ran our dead
guy, Marko Joseph.

22:22.430 --> 22:25.220
Turns out that's an alias
for a man by the name of

22:25.220 --> 22:25.930
Andreas Koslov.

22:25.930 --> 22:28.390
STEVE:
Who is that?
He's some egghead

22:28.390 --> 22:29.260
who used to run the entire

22:29.260 --> 22:30.850
Ukraine chemical weapons
program.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.850
About six months ago,

22:31.850 --> 22:34.180
the guy disappeared
with some materials

22:34.180 --> 22:34.850
from a lab.

22:34.850 --> 22:36.260
Interpol thinks
he's been shopping

22:36.260 --> 22:37.350
a chemical weapon around.

22:37.350 --> 22:38.760
They issued
a red notice on him,

22:38.760 --> 22:40.220
but so far, no sightings.

22:40.220 --> 22:42.590
Now he shows up on a boat
off the coast of Oahu,

22:42.590 --> 22:43.180
virus in tow.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.350
ADAM:
We're thinking he was using

22:44.350 --> 22:45.590
theSerenityto get himself

22:45.590 --> 22:47.100
and the virus
onto American soil.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.390
But it all unravels
when the virus

22:48.390 --> 22:52.100
somehow gets loose, infects
all the other passengers

22:52.100 --> 22:55.600
and they turn on Marko
aka Koslov.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.590
Hold on, we thought
Monique got off the boat

22:59.590 --> 23:01.260
before the virus was released.

23:01.260 --> 23:02.470
This seems to contradict that.

23:02.470 --> 23:04.390
She told us
this was a robbery,

23:04.390 --> 23:07.600
but the passengers were
actually attacking Marko

23:07.600 --> 23:09.590
because they were infected
by the virus.

23:09.590 --> 23:12.470
So, either Monique
got really lucky

23:12.470 --> 23:13.470
to avoid being infected...

23:13.470 --> 23:14.720
Or she's not telling us
the truth.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.260
We need to talk to
your friend again.

23:17.260 --> 23:18.510
Acquaintance.

23:18.510 --> 23:19.590
Yeah, and while you're at it,

23:19.590 --> 23:21.100
maybe you should ask
her to explain this.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.050
I ran financials on everybody

23:23.050 --> 23:25.930
and something came up
on Monique,

23:25.930 --> 23:27.760
namely, a bunch
of shell companies

23:27.760 --> 23:30.510
that all trace back to her that
she recently used to receive

23:30.510 --> 23:34.800
$500,000 in payments from an
offshore account in the Caymans.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.590
STEVE: Well, I think we just
figured out how Koslov

23:36.590 --> 23:38.760
got his invitation
onto theSerenity.

23:38.760 --> 23:42.720
He paid Monique to get him
on that boat.

23:43.470 --> 23:46.390
You feeling well enough
to take a phone call?

23:46.390 --> 23:48.180
Someone's calling for me?
Mm-hmm.

23:48.180 --> 23:51.800
I placed him on hold. You can
take it right over there.

23:54.260 --> 23:55.850
Hello?

23:55.850 --> 23:58.300
MAN:
Can you talk?

23:58.300 --> 23:59.680
Hi, Dad.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.470
Um, yeah, I just...

24:02.470 --> 24:04.720
one second.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.510
I don't know what happened.

24:06.510 --> 24:08.100
There was a problem
with the case

24:08.100 --> 24:09.260
and people started getting sick.

24:09.260 --> 24:10.430
They attacked Andreas.

24:10.430 --> 24:11.640
I had to get out of there.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.390
So you don't have the virus?

24:13.390 --> 24:14.890
No.

24:14.890 --> 24:16.550
The cops know about it now.

24:16.550 --> 24:18.140
They have people
out on the boat.

24:18.140 --> 24:20.600
Then the deal is dead.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.140
I want my money back.

24:22.140 --> 24:23.390
You have one hour.

24:23.390 --> 24:25.010
(line clicks)

24:33.350 --> 24:34.590
(beeps)

24:34.590 --> 24:36.890
(siren chirps)

24:49.430 --> 24:51.510
Monique Sims, Five...

24:52.600 --> 24:55.100
Lock this place down now.

24:55.100 --> 24:59.550
(alarm blaring)

25:06.430 --> 25:08.590
Come join Five-O.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.970
It's a great experience.

25:09.970 --> 25:12.140
Help a lot of people,
make a difference.

25:12.140 --> 25:15.510
You can get hemorrhagic flu
two months into the job.

25:15.510 --> 25:16.550
You could die.

25:16.550 --> 25:19.100
Yeah, well,
at least you got a job.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.590
Hey, you know what the silver
lining is... (clears throat)

25:21.590 --> 25:25.510
...that you haven't had
to deal with this-this lunatic

25:25.510 --> 25:27.180
for the last seven years.

25:27.180 --> 25:28.590
Stuff like this happens
all the time.

25:28.590 --> 25:30.100
Right, okay.
Are you saying that

25:30.100 --> 25:31.850
it's a good thing
that I'm dying today?

25:31.850 --> 25:34.590
No, I'm just saying you saved
yourself a lot of stress

25:34.590 --> 25:36.890
over the last seven years,
you know what I mean?

25:36.890 --> 25:38.260
Job ages you.
Look at me.

25:38.260 --> 25:40.590
I used to be gorgeous.
STEVE:
Know what?

25:40.590 --> 25:42.640
You guys can sit around
planning your funerals,

25:42.640 --> 25:44.260
but there's an
antidote out there

25:44.260 --> 25:46.550
and Grover and Jerry
are gonna find it.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.550
(phone ringing)

25:50.550 --> 25:51.850
Hello?

25:51.850 --> 25:54.350
Bad news, Steve. Monique's gone.

25:54.590 --> 25:56.800
What do... what do you mean,
"Monique's gone"?

25:56.800 --> 25:58.930
ADAM:
She fled the hospital

25:58.930 --> 26:00.300
after receiving
a phone call.

26:00.300 --> 26:00.890
Left a nurse dead.

26:00.890 --> 26:03.590
Jerry tried tracing the call,
but it came back as a burner.

26:03.590 --> 26:04.930
There's an APB out.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.350
Meanwhile, we can assume
we're not the only ones

26:07.350 --> 26:08.100
looking for her.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.260
STEVE: Yeah, we know
that there was a buyer

26:09.260 --> 26:11.140
for the virus and now
that Marko hasn't shown,

26:11.140 --> 26:13.050
he's probably gonna be looking
for his money back. Right?

26:13.050 --> 26:14.590
ADAM:
Which means our best shot

26:14.590 --> 26:16.640
at finding Monique
and getting the antidote

26:16.640 --> 26:17.890
is to find this buyer.

26:17.890 --> 26:19.550
Jerry's working on it now.

26:19.550 --> 26:20.850
Copy that.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.470
I've tried everything,

26:23.470 --> 26:25.590
but I keep hitting a
wall on this trace.

26:25.590 --> 26:27.590
At first I get this bank
in Zurich,

26:27.590 --> 26:29.220
which was the source
of the $500,000 wire

26:29.220 --> 26:30.640
that Monique received, but
no one there will talk to me.

26:30.640 --> 26:34.590
We got to find a way to make
them talk to us, Jerry.
Yeah.

26:34.590 --> 26:36.590
Well, Swiss banking laws
are as tough as they come.

26:36.590 --> 26:38.640
I mean, maybe we can get
the State department involved,

26:38.640 --> 26:40.010
but that'll take time.

26:40.010 --> 26:41.350
Time we don't have.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.390
Jerry, what's
the name of the bank?

26:43.390 --> 26:45.390
Odermatt bank in Geneva.

26:46.140 --> 26:47.590
(sighs)

26:47.590 --> 26:50.180
Give me 20 minutes.

26:51.140 --> 26:53.510
(door opens)

26:53.760 --> 26:58.590

27:53.510 --> 27:58.010
Fancy booze, I didn't want
to let it go to waste.

27:58.010 --> 27:58.800
Figure I'll be dead

27:58.800 --> 28:03.550
before the hangover
kicks in anyhow, right?

28:03.550 --> 28:05.640
(chuckles)

28:10.350 --> 28:13.890
Do you want a paper
bag or something?

28:13.890 --> 28:16.590
What?

28:16.590 --> 28:18.430
A very expensive
bottle of champagne,

28:18.430 --> 28:19.930
you're drinking
it like a wino.

28:19.930 --> 28:21.050
You're disgusting.

28:21.050 --> 28:22.640
Spitting all in the
bottle and everything.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.970
What's the matter
with you?

28:26.640 --> 28:28.590
So, I just want
to get this straight.

28:28.590 --> 28:31.100
You're worried
about my cooties now?

28:33.140 --> 28:36.640
It's a good point.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.590
(exhales)

28:49.590 --> 28:50.590
You know, um,

28:50.590 --> 28:55.850
I've, uh, I've been doing
some thinking.

28:55.850 --> 28:57.390
And I, uh... (clears throat)

28:57.390 --> 28:58.300
...want to tell you something.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.300
I want to talk to you...
You don't. Don't-don't.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.260
Just, let's not, okay?

29:02.260 --> 29:04.180
Uh, uh, I know.

29:04.180 --> 29:04.720
You know what?

29:04.720 --> 29:07.010
I haven't said anything.
I know what you're gonna say.

29:07.010 --> 29:08.180
I feel the same way,
all right, Danny?

29:08.180 --> 29:10.100
Let's not do that.
I don't want to do that.

29:10.100 --> 29:14.680
You feel the same way about the
waiting room in our restaurant?

29:14.680 --> 29:16.850
What?

29:17.930 --> 29:22.010
I think most restaurants
don't have, like,

29:22.010 --> 29:25.050
a nice waiting
area, you know?

29:25.050 --> 29:25.680
Show up,

29:25.680 --> 29:28.430
standing around,
waiting for a table.

29:28.430 --> 29:30.350
It's crowded.
You're bumping into people.

29:30.350 --> 29:32.470
People coming out of the kitchen
with plates.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.590
You feel like a schmuck
standing there.

29:34.590 --> 29:36.720
You're all jammed up.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.550
Think it'd be nice

29:38.550 --> 29:40.180
maybe have a...

29:40.180 --> 29:42.970
nice little, you know,
waiting area.

29:42.970 --> 29:44.050
Not like just a waiting area,

29:44.050 --> 29:46.430
you make it like a feature,
you know?

29:46.430 --> 29:49.890
Yeah. Yeah.

29:49.890 --> 29:51.970
It's like a waiting room
you want to wait in.

29:51.970 --> 29:54.100
Right, 'cause everybody
knows that our joint

29:54.100 --> 29:54.760
is gonna be, uh,

29:54.760 --> 29:57.600
gonna be jumping all the time.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.350
Yeah, yeah.

29:58.350 --> 30:01.470
You know, a couple club chairs
or something.

30:01.470 --> 30:02.590
A little table next to it.

30:02.590 --> 30:05.470
You put your hors d'oeuvres,
put your drinks.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.470
Be nice.

30:06.470 --> 30:10.260
We could have one server,
one waitress who's just...

30:10.260 --> 30:12.590
that's her area,
you know what I mean?

30:12.590 --> 30:13.930
No one else, uh...

30:13.930 --> 30:16.890
That's not really
economically feasible.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.300
No, you're right.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.430
It's not.

30:21.430 --> 30:22.590
It's a great idea, Danny.

30:22.590 --> 30:26.180
I really, uh...
I really like it.

30:26.180 --> 30:29.590
(distant thunder crashing)

30:38.590 --> 30:41.140
That's not good, is it?

30:42.800 --> 30:45.300
No.

30:46.050 --> 30:50.600
Ah, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
go have a little lay down.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.260
Okay.

30:52.260 --> 30:55.430
I think I'm gonna be
a little while, okay?

30:55.430 --> 30:58.470
(thunder rumbling)

31:04.890 --> 31:07.390
(phone ringing)

31:09.590 --> 31:10.760
Okay, I have it.

31:10.760 --> 31:11.550
MAN:
Good.

31:11.550 --> 31:14.390
There's a bus bench on the
corner of Kahili and Lorrin.

31:14.390 --> 31:15.260
15 minutes.

31:15.260 --> 31:18.590
And if I give you your money
back, this is over, right?

31:18.590 --> 31:19.800
Just be there.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.590
(phone beeps off)

31:20.590 --> 31:24.550
All right, take him
back and book him.

31:27.890 --> 31:31.300
Well, that was the easy part.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.550
(sirens wailing)

31:51.510 --> 31:54.720
Monique Sims,
down on the ground right now!

31:54.720 --> 31:57.590
Hold your fire!

32:13.430 --> 32:15.220
Freeze, Monique!

32:18.600 --> 32:21.010
Freeze! Let me see your hands!

32:22.720 --> 32:24.590
(groans)

32:24.590 --> 32:26.590
Damn it.

32:29.890 --> 32:31.080
GROVER: Monique, that
antidote you took,

32:31.180 --> 32:33.220
where can we find it?
We need it.

32:33.220 --> 32:35.550
Where is it?!

32:37.890 --> 32:39.590
Monique...

32:39.590 --> 32:41.590
I know you're
not a bad person.

32:41.590 --> 32:42.590
You just got in
over your head,

32:42.590 --> 32:45.390
but you have to do
the right thing now.

32:45.390 --> 32:47.100
Our friends will
die if you don't.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.350
Stop. Stop right there.

32:48.350 --> 32:50.510
She's fine. Step back.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.680
She's gonna be fine.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.590
Oh, no, you ain't.

32:55.890 --> 32:58.100
You took a through
and through to the gut.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.390
You're gonna bleed out quick.

32:59.390 --> 33:02.140
So, you tell me where
that antidote is

33:02.140 --> 33:05.720
right now,
or I let you die.

33:12.260 --> 33:13.140
Captain Grover.
GROVER:
Yeah?

33:13.140 --> 33:15.590
I've got wind shear
over 100 knots. Zero viz.

33:15.590 --> 33:18.100
I'm flying on instruments.
With this much turbulence,

33:18.100 --> 33:20.550
we've only got one shot at this.

33:20.550 --> 33:21.260
GROVER:
Okay, listen,

33:21.260 --> 33:23.590
I need you to patch me in
to Commander McGarrett.

33:23.590 --> 33:28.430
I need him on standby
because we're going in.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.970
(thunder crashing)

33:37.760 --> 33:39.590
What happened...

33:45.050 --> 33:47.680
What happened
to the champagne?

33:47.680 --> 33:49.970
If you're still
telling jokes,

33:49.970 --> 33:51.760
it means you're not dead--
drink some water.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.100
I'm cold, man.
Drink some water.

33:54.100 --> 33:54.590
Don't want it.

33:54.590 --> 33:58.260
Have some water, Danny.
I don't want any of that.

34:03.890 --> 34:07.760
PILOT (on comm):
Commander McGarrett,
this is Air One, do you copy?

34:08.590 --> 34:09.970
Air One?

34:09.970 --> 34:12.550
Yes, Air One, go ahead.
I read you, go ahead.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.680
Commander McGarrett,
be advised,

34:14.680 --> 34:16.590
we are approaching
your location.

34:16.590 --> 34:17.590
Copy that.

34:17.590 --> 34:19.590
GROVER:
Steve, we have the antidote.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.430
Danny...

34:21.430 --> 34:23.260
helo's here, buddy.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.590
(muttering)
Chopper's here.

34:24.590 --> 34:27.220
(muttering)
(thunder crashing)

34:30.890 --> 34:33.140
Okay.

34:34.590 --> 34:36.260
(moans)

34:47.010 --> 34:48.970
(helicopter approaching)

35:02.760 --> 35:04.300
Lou!

35:04.300 --> 35:07.590
I see you! Do you see me?!

35:09.760 --> 35:11.760
Hold on.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.890
Yeah. All right,
I got a visual on you.

35:13.890 --> 35:17.590
Just hang in there, baby,
hang tight.

35:18.590 --> 35:20.640
PILOT:
Wind shear's spinning us around.

35:20.850 --> 35:25.180
GROVER: Just get us a little
closer, now, a little closer.

35:26.760 --> 35:29.550
Oh, boy, we got
another cell converging.

35:29.550 --> 35:31.430
This storm's about
to get bigger.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.590
Lou, this storm's about
to get a lot worse.

35:33.590 --> 35:34.850
You gotta make this happen now.

35:34.850 --> 35:38.180
GROVER:
Copy that. Okay, Steve,

35:38.180 --> 35:40.390
we're gonna send
a cable down to you.

35:40.390 --> 35:41.640
(thunder crashing)

35:41.640 --> 35:43.260
When you get ahold of the cable,

35:43.260 --> 35:44.260
you attach it to the rail,

35:44.260 --> 35:47.260
and I'll send you down
the package. Confirm.

35:47.260 --> 35:50.640
Copy, Lou!
I copy that!

36:00.050 --> 36:02.550
(winch whining)

36:20.890 --> 36:23.140
Careful.
Watch out, watch out!

36:24.350 --> 36:26.680
Go, go, grab it!

36:26.680 --> 36:28.510
Got it.

36:31.180 --> 36:32.350
Got it!

36:32.350 --> 36:34.680
Okay, Lou! Let's go!

36:36.430 --> 36:38.800
(thunder crashing)

36:41.590 --> 36:43.590
All right,
I'm sending it down.

36:52.590 --> 36:54.590
(alarm blaring)

36:58.510 --> 37:00.600
Pull it up.
TANI: No!

37:00.600 --> 37:02.260
Oh, no, no, no!

37:02.260 --> 37:05.140
No!

37:05.590 --> 37:08.510
I got it.
There it is.

37:08.510 --> 37:10.390
No, no.

37:20.590 --> 37:22.800
It's right there.
It's right there.

37:23.600 --> 37:27.260
Right there, I see it!
McGarrett!

37:27.890 --> 37:29.590
JUNIOR:
Come on, come on, grab it.

37:29.590 --> 37:31.850
A little further.
Okay, you got it.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.140
McGarrett!

37:49.140 --> 37:50.510
McGarrett!
I don't see him.

37:50.510 --> 37:54.140
Do you see him?
Where is he?
McGarrett!

37:54.140 --> 37:56.600
McGarrett!

38:10.760 --> 38:14.220
Junior, right there!
See him?

38:34.470 --> 38:36.850
(thunder crashing)

38:58.010 --> 39:01.180
That's it.
Watch your step.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.590
Come on. Come on.

39:14.010 --> 39:16.300
Come on.

39:21.470 --> 39:24.590
(helicopter blades whirring)

39:50.510 --> 39:52.720
(panting)

40:00.930 --> 40:03.390
♪ ♪

40:13.430 --> 40:15.720
That's good.
How about Uncle Jerry?

40:15.720 --> 40:19.430
How's he doing with
the babysitting duties?

40:19.430 --> 40:21.800
Grace, you can't
let him do that.

40:21.800 --> 40:25.100
What's the matter with you?
He's a... he's a giant child.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.180
Okay, you got a child
watching a ch--

40:27.180 --> 40:28.850
You've got to be
the grown-up. Okay?

40:28.850 --> 40:29.970
You've got to be
the adult in the house

40:29.970 --> 40:32.850
till I get back, and that's
gonna be only a couple days,

40:32.850 --> 40:34.390
all right?

40:34.390 --> 40:37.550
Okay. Listen,
kiss your little brother.

40:37.550 --> 40:39.140
I love you both very much.

40:39.140 --> 40:41.760
All right.
(phone beeps off)

40:44.100 --> 40:47.100
Buddy, you got a six-pack.
We get it. Relax, would you?

40:47.100 --> 40:49.010
Yeah, just trying
to stay in shape

40:49.010 --> 40:51.510
while we're stuck in here.

41:08.590 --> 41:10.300
Yeah, you know,
it's your move, right?

41:10.300 --> 41:11.140
Yes, thank you.
Okay.

41:11.140 --> 41:12.590
I was just saying,
in case you forgot.

41:12.590 --> 41:13.640
It's been, like,
ten minutes.

41:13.640 --> 41:15.590
Didn't forget.
Thank you, thank you.

41:15.590 --> 41:19.010
Yeah, totally.
Take your time.

41:20.590 --> 41:22.180
DANNY:
Hey, um,

41:22.180 --> 41:24.390
I was thinking,
I could, uh,

41:24.390 --> 41:25.640
maybe call some furniture shops,

41:25.640 --> 41:27.590
see if I find some chairs
that we like.

41:27.590 --> 41:30.010
What for?
Why do you want chairs?

41:30.010 --> 41:32.970
Chairs for the... for the
waiting room in the restaurant.

41:32.970 --> 41:35.850
No, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't do that.

41:35.850 --> 41:38.590
You don't want to
put chairs in the waiting room?

41:38.590 --> 41:39.140
I'm sorry, I don't...

41:39.140 --> 41:40.930
I don't want to do the
waiting room at all, Danny.

41:40.930 --> 41:42.390
What are you talking about?

41:42.390 --> 41:44.430
You liked the idea just fine
the other day.

41:44.430 --> 41:45.390
No, I didn't,
I hated it

41:45.390 --> 41:46.590
the minute it came
out of your mouth,

41:46.590 --> 41:48.550
but I figured since we were
all probably about to die,

41:48.550 --> 41:49.930
I didn't want
to upset you, so...

41:49.930 --> 41:52.720
Oh, but now it's okay
to upset me?

41:52.720 --> 41:55.390
You're saying now it's okay
to upset me?
Now that we're not dying,

41:55.390 --> 41:56.590
yes, it's different.

41:56.590 --> 41:57.800
Can you please just
make your move?

41:57.800 --> 41:58.590
Will you just make it?

41:58.590 --> 41:59.760
Do you see the kind
of person he is?

41:59.760 --> 42:01.800
I just want you to be clear
that this is a selfish man,

42:01.800 --> 42:04.680
okay, that cares about nothing
but what he wants and...

42:04.680 --> 42:07.590
Okay, okay, okay!
...and what he says.

42:07.590 --> 42:10.590
Okay?

42:10.590 --> 42:11.350
Checkmate.

42:11.350 --> 42:13.970
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.550
You see what you
just made me do?

42:15.550 --> 42:16.890
I made you bad at chess?

42:16.890 --> 42:19.050
No, you rushed me.
He didn't rush you.

42:19.050 --> 42:20.720
He just put you out
of your misery.

42:20.720 --> 42:23.590
I had you dead to rights,
like, six moves ago.

42:23.590 --> 42:24.850
Six moves?
Yep.

42:24.850 --> 42:27.140
I knew you were
bad chess player.
I'm not a bad chess player.

42:27.140 --> 42:29.800
He's actually not a bad chess
player. He's pretty good.
Thank you.

42:29.800 --> 42:32.850
It's just that I'm
much, much better.

42:33.510 --> 42:35.590
No, he-he's not good at chess.

42:35.590 --> 42:38.430
Obviously, you are
bad at chess.
Danny...

42:38.430 --> 42:38.640
What?

42:38.640 --> 42:41.590
Some things require
a little more thought.

42:41.590 --> 42:42.590
DANNY: Are you talking
about chairs again?

42:42.590 --> 42:44.640
My chairs?
No, no, I'm not
talking about that.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.590
That requires zero thought.
Then what are you
talking about?

42:46.590 --> 42:49.550
That's not something I ever
have to think about again.

42:49.550 --> 42:51.350
Why would you do that?

42:51.350 --> 42:52.590
What is wrong?
What?

42:52.590 --> 42:55.930
What about it
is a bad idea?
