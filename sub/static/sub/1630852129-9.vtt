26:44.311 --> 26:46.104
I also want a family and kids,

26:46.187 --> 26:48.523
and I know you do want
the same thing as me.

26:48.606 --> 26:50.025
I've kind of wondered, like,

26:50.108 --> 26:51.776
"Are we truly in
the same space?" So--

26:51.860 --> 26:53.820
- What is your reservation
about that?

26:53.903 --> 26:55.864
- As we were starting to get
to know each other,

26:55.947 --> 26:58.533
you went hard
in the beginning pursuing,

26:58.616 --> 27:03.413
and it seemed as soon as you
knew my feelings, it shifted,

27:03.496 --> 27:06.041
so that makes me
kind of feel like,

27:06.124 --> 27:08.710
"Do you actually love the chase
and you don't realize it?"

27:08.793 --> 27:10.795
- The difference between, like,
you and I's position

27:10.879 --> 27:12.672
in, like, this experience
is that you were able

27:12.756 --> 27:15.342
to explore all curiosity,
and I wasn't,

27:15.425 --> 27:17.802
and I had shut down
the possibility for curiosity

27:17.886 --> 27:20.764
because I was so dead set
on pursuing you.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.182
And then when I felt hurt
by you,

27:22.265 --> 27:24.059
I was like,
"Well, I'm still here."

27:24.142 --> 27:26.770
The reason that I backed off,
it was because I wasn't clear.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.521
If you would've told me
in the beginning

27:28.605 --> 27:30.273
that you were falling for me
the whole time,

27:30.357 --> 27:32.192
we'd be in a completely
different position right now.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.152
- But it was also
in the first few days,

27:34.235 --> 27:36.154
and I'm not going to tell you--
- Yeah, I didn't expect you

27:36.237 --> 27:37.906
to tell me
in the first few days.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.949
- I'm not going to tell you
everything I'm feeling inside

27:40.033 --> 27:41.409
when I know that--

27:41.493 --> 27:43.119
- But I was giving you
everything I was feeling.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.704
- It was way too fast.

27:44.788 --> 27:45.705
- But arguably, like,

27:45.789 --> 27:47.040
time is of the essence.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.750
Maybe after the whole
Brianna thing,

27:48.833 --> 27:50.043
I did question, like,

27:50.126 --> 27:51.586
are you serious
about finding love,

27:51.669 --> 27:53.254
because why wouldn't
you choose me?

27:53.338 --> 27:54.964
- I needed to be fair
and give each person a date.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.591
- You didn't need to be fair.
You chose to be fair.

27:56.674 --> 27:58.259
- In the same way
that you want to be chosen,

27:58.343 --> 27:59.928
I need to be chosen.
- You can't blame me for this.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.262
In my own conscious--
- I can blame you for this

28:01.346 --> 28:03.765
'cause you did
have free choice.

28:03.848 --> 28:07.102
<i>- I don't feel like</i>

28:12.649 --> 28:15.735
<i>and doesn't seem to want</i>
<i>to hear anything else.</i>

28:15.819 --> 28:20.031
Like, that's not the kind
of love that I'm looking for.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.200
Maybe in trying to do
the right thing,

28:22.283 --> 28:25.537
I made the wrong decision,
and I apologize for that.

28:25.620 --> 28:28.123
- Based on my experience,

28:28.206 --> 28:29.582
I just needed more.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.419
- And based on my experience,
I needed to see

28:32.502 --> 28:34.879
more than a few days
of love-bombing.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.298
I get a little bit wary
if someone's going to do a lot

28:37.382 --> 28:39.759
in the beginning,
that is going to stop

28:39.843 --> 28:42.011
if they're not getting
the exact result

28:42.095 --> 28:43.680
that they want
fast enough from me.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.974
And the thing is, I'm not
going to give it super fast.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.184
I'm not gonna give it in the
first few days or two weeks.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.145
That is a very short
period of time.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.897
But will you get that from me
in the long run?

28:52.981 --> 28:54.524
Yes. Absolutely.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.651
If someone's not gonna give
that back to you right away,

28:56.734 --> 28:58.570
that doesn't mean
that they're in the wrong.

28:58.653 --> 28:59.904
That doesn't mean
that they don't like you.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.197
- I'm not saying
you're in the wrong.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.657
Because I wasn't
love-bombing you.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.659
That's a type of, like,
love manipulation.

29:04.742 --> 29:06.161
- Then why would you
pull it back

29:06.244 --> 29:08.121
when you don't get
an immediate result?

29:08.204 --> 29:10.874
- That was my method of letting
you know where I was at

29:10.957 --> 29:13.251
so that way you never
questioned where I was at.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.503
For me, putting all my eggs
in one basket

29:15.587 --> 29:17.255
and focusing on one person

29:17.338 --> 29:20.508
until I know it's that person
isn't the way that I roll.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.886
- Then you can understand
why I didn't put all my eggs

29:22.969 --> 29:24.345

in the beginning, and I--

29:24.429 --> 29:25.763

You know,
