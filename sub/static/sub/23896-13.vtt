WEBVTT

00:08.883 --> 00:11.803
<i>Good morning, I'm Johnny Frost,</i>
<i>and you're watching </i>Frost Bites.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.346
<i>According to Pentagon sources,</i>

00:13.430 --> 00:16.349
<i>anti-zombie hardliners</i>
<i>in our nation's capital</i>

00:16.433 --> 00:17.600
<i>have won the day.</i>

00:17.684 --> 00:20.937
<i>All shipments of brains</i>
<i>into Seattle have been halted.</i>

00:21.020 --> 00:24.274
<i>A delegation of Seattle luminaries</i>
<i>sent to lobby on behalf</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:26.693
<i>of the city's undead population</i>

00:26.776 --> 00:29.154
<i>received a chilly response from a Congress</i>

00:29.237 --> 00:32.615
<i>dominated by a hardline</i>
<i>anti-zombie faction.</i>

00:32.699 --> 00:34.492
<i>-Though the hearing was closed--</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:35.869
<i>This is Peyton Charles,</i>
<i>leave me a message.</i>

00:35.952 --> 00:39.122
Hey, sweetie, uh, just heard the news.

00:39.789 --> 00:44.210
I imagine you're asleep,
exhausted from arguing with morons.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.631
You better not be on a plane back here.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.968
You stay there where it's safe.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.304
There's gonna be a day
of reckoning in Seattle once we've run out of brains.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.559
Listen.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.228
You should know,

01:03.313 --> 01:05.482
-I love--

01:09.569 --> 01:10.695
Oh, hello.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.198
Yeah, back at you.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.825
Uh, sorry, uh, come in.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.245
You look like
you've already heard the news.

01:19.829 --> 01:22.499
Uh, yeah, it was a...
Johnny Frost, <i>Frost Bite.</i>

01:22.665 --> 01:24.334
No more brains to Seattle.
They're just gonna--

01:24.417 --> 01:26.628
No, different news. Mine is worse.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.756
Renegade turned herself
into Fillmore-Graves.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.134
Whoa. They've got Levon, too.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.762
They're gonna smash
their heads at Fort Winning Park.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.223
-Tomorrow. Noon.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.518
I've got to get moving.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.186
What are you gonna go do?

01:44.437 --> 01:47.232
Beg Chase Graves to spare Liv's life.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.609
All right.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.694
Good luck with that.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.826
Come in.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.577
Uh, you decent?

02:00.078 --> 02:02.288
I'm dressed. That'll have to do.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.540
Breakfast.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.916
It's not much.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.294
So you know, uh,
the government has decided to stop

02:08.378 --> 02:10.213
all shipments of brains into Seattle.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.765
Hey.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.813
I got your message.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.523
Sounds like I'm in big trouble, huh?

02:29.149 --> 02:32.026
I mean, I almost didn't stop by.
I was so afraid

02:32.110 --> 02:33.987
of what you'd do to me,
I was like, can I even come?

02:46.541 --> 02:48.918
It didn't occur to you that
I might want that news about Liv

02:49.002 --> 02:51.004
before we made our way up to the bedroom?

02:51.087 --> 02:55.758
Well, I've missed you a lot and, you know,
I thought I might never see you again,

02:55.842 --> 02:57.927
and let's face it. It only set us back...

02:58.136 --> 03:00.013
-Not even.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.348
Hey, Ravi?

03:03.099 --> 03:05.184
I'm heading home to check on my brothers.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.228
-Yeah, okay.
-You're an animal.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.731
-I would not have guessed.
-Oh. Goodbye, Jordan.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.149
Okay, who's that?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.902
Uh, that's a member of Major's squad.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.990
We need to get a hold of Clive.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.992
Clive

03:21.284 --> 03:22.160
Do you want to face Clive

03:22.243 --> 03:24.162
if this is the last chance
we ever have to see Liv?

03:30.126 --> 03:31.294
It was just Ravi.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.505
Maybe it's a sign.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.592
Maybe we should wait.

03:37.675 --> 03:40.053
Ravi's phone call is a sign?

03:40.345 --> 03:41.304
Yeah.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.431
Didn't we talk about this all night?

03:53.691 --> 03:55.777
Ravi, again.

03:59.155 --> 04:04.494
Waiting until marriage doesn't sound
even a little bit sexy?

04:11.834 --> 04:12.919
Hello?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.381
-It's God.
-Hmm.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.966
He says we should wait.

04:18.049 --> 04:19.550
It's Ravi, isn't it?

04:20.051 --> 04:22.095
-Uh, let me see that.
-Yeah.

04:25.515 --> 04:26.933
Ravi, take a hint. This--

04:30.061 --> 04:31.604
I'll meet you there. Bye.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.775
Fillmore-Graves

04:37.318 --> 04:38.736
has Liv. They plan to execute her.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.369
She's awake.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.128
Justin?

04:55.545 --> 04:57.130
Next meal's in two hours.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.758
Well, then.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.011
Enjoy.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.601
<i>-Yeah, it's me.</i>

05:10.977 --> 05:13.062
<i>How you doing?</i>
<i>Ravi said you went back home today.</i>

05:13.354 --> 05:15.606
Well, I'd say I'm at about 70%.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.816
<i>Where are you?</i>

05:16.899 --> 05:18.609
You remember that
terrible horse-themed hotel

05:18.693 --> 05:19.986
where we busted the Dead Enders?

05:20.069 --> 05:21.946
It wasn't so bad.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.949
Listen, I need you to do something for me.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.076
Okay.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.089
Oh.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.219
Got any more?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.354
Levon.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.689
Liv.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.149
I love you.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.984
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.236
-I'm fine. Wait a second.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.738
Wait, wait, wait!

06:04.072 --> 06:05.656
Hang tough, Liv.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.993
Don't let them break you!

06:22.840 --> 06:24.300
Come in, Ms. Moore.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.812
Last month, you sucker-punched me
in your precinct house,

06:35.895 --> 06:42.276
while all your human buddies looked on,
braying like donkeys.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.405
I told you someday you would regret it.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.407
That day has arrived.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.911
Tell me the names

06:52.829 --> 06:56.290
of every conspirator
of the Underground Railroad.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.589
This is going to hurt.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.392
Give me those names.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.028
How's the stick working?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.030
The stick will work.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.032
Hmm.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.035
Think we'll give the carrot a shot.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.830
Have her slap on some makeup
and bring her to my office.

07:36.914 --> 07:40.626
Imagine my surprise
when I found out Renegade was Ms. Moore.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.963
I suppose all the signs were there.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.215
Oh.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.677
Here's the deal.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.722
You get one minute to say your goodbyes.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.640
That's 20 seconds each.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.226
-Chase, be reasonable.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.437
Or Ms. Moore can earn an extra minute

07:59.520 --> 08:02.315
for each name of one
of her Underground Railroad employees,

08:03.191 --> 08:04.275
starting now.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.239
Clive, Levon's documentary.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.409
It's all on a hard drive
in a cookie bowl in my apartment.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.828
Release it and see
if we can get the crowd behind us.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.208
Try to remember me on this brain, Clive.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.043
This is the one that loves you.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.336
You got it, partner.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.090
I'm not gonna get to eat Isobel's brain.

08:28.549 --> 08:29.842
She'd want you to have it.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.427
We're getting you out of this, Liv.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.222
-But if you don't...
-We're gonna get you out of this.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.266
-Your face.
Fifteen seconds.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.901
If they go through with this,
they're gonna pay, Liv.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.819
I will make it my mission.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.780
Then they should be very afraid.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.951
We always said we were gonna make
big names for ourselves.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.079
I guess we should've been more specific.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.706
Time's up.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.001
Unless you wanna put
another quarter in the slot.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.055
I suggest you camp out for seats.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.891
I hear the ones up front are going fast.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.603
Good seats are going fast.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.606
It's safe to say
they'll place snipers there,

09:26.357 --> 09:28.484
-there--
Fillmore-Graves. Papers, please.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.444
Whoa, whoa, wait. It's me.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.780
-Major.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.241
Working on it.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.414
Peyton, what'd you find?

09:41.497 --> 09:42.957
Okay, I've got some good news.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.625
She's got good news. What is it?

09:44.709 --> 09:47.295
So there's a manhole cover
50 yards from the guillotine.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.338
If we can get Levon and Liv that distance,

09:49.714 --> 09:51.632
<i>-they can disappear.</i>
-We're in business.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.801
You should ask him.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.012
Ravi.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.514
They're nearly ready
to release Levon's documentary.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.099
Liv said to release it.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.768
They wanna know
if you want your face blurred.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.818
No.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.321
If it doesn't work,
they'll come after you.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.947
Yeah.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.407
Well... I love you.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.203
I know.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.747
Oh, no, you didn't.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.499
I'm kidding. I love you, too.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.418
I love you <i>mucho...</i> I...

10:27.501 --> 10:28.919
I love you <i>mucho grande.</i>

10:29.086 --> 10:31.047
I love you like gangbusters.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.508
To infinity and beyond...
I was doing Han Solo.

10:34.592 --> 10:35.968
<i>I thought it would be charming.</i>

10:36.052 --> 10:37.303
It was a little charming.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.597
I mean,
I like the groveling afterwards better.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.307
I can grovel some more.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.644
Okay, I'll call you back in 20 minutes
with the electrical grid information.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.354
<i>-Bye, dork.</i>
-Bye.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.563
I love you.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.066
Well played.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.194
Snipers there, there, there.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.278
They wanna get underground.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.489
Booby trap the manhole covers
here and here.

10:56.572 --> 10:57.615
Commander.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.949
You should take a look at this.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.369
What is it?

11:01.452 --> 11:03.829
It appears to be
a full-length documentary film

11:03.913 --> 11:06.165
about the exploits
of our prisoner, Renegade.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.376
<i>Liv Moore understood</i>
<i>the stakes when she took over</i>

11:08.459 --> 11:11.128
<i>Seattle's largest</i>
<i>human smuggling organization.</i>

11:11.212 --> 11:13.631
<i>She was there when her predecessor</i>
<i>was executed.</i>

11:14.340 --> 11:16.967
<i>She resuscitated the organization</i>
<i>when others believed</i>

11:17.051 --> 11:20.554
<i>Fillmore-Graves' attempt</i>
<i>at intimidation had succeeded.</i>

11:24.725 --> 11:26.352
Is that Paul Rudd narrating?

11:26.560 --> 11:29.480
-Yeah, sounds like it.
-Paul Rudd, he's a good get.

11:29.563 --> 11:30.523
Yeah.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.900
I assume we've already begun identifying
everyone in this video?

11:33.401 --> 11:34.944
-Of course, sir.
-Round them up.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.362
There's an anvil in their future.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.864
Hey! Let go of me! Get off me, dude!

11:38.948 --> 11:39.949
Let her go.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.245
I want back in.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.122
I expect you back. You never left.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.541
Yeah, well, I want double tubes this time.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.961
-My family's starving.
-You get the same tubes as everyone else.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.382
I know where you can find Lillywhite.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.304
I believe we can find some extra tubes
for such valuable information.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.646
Clear!

12:16.318 --> 12:17.653
The soup is still warm.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.947
The mirror's fogged up.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.657
We just missed him.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.284
Where the hell is he?

12:23.951 --> 12:26.036
This guy was one
of the Fillmore-Graves guards

12:26.120 --> 12:27.913
when Chase Graves was threatening
to eat me.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.166
Let's just waste him now.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.460
-They've killed enough of ours.
-Hey, now.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.170
Curtis.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.380
This is the guy Renegade
had me bring back.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.631
Major.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.718
The floor is yours.

12:45.055 --> 12:47.600
The woman you call Renegade
used to be my fiancée.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.103
She's someone I care about deeply.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.064
Look, I know how Fillmore-Graves
is going to defend the park.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.276
We don't want to get into a gunfight.
We need to surprise them

12:57.359 --> 12:58.944
and use the crowd to our advantage.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.948
At the last execution, at least half
the people there were fans of executions.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.075
Well, that won't be the case this time.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.329
You wanna know how many people
have watched that documentary?

13:08.787 --> 13:10.748
Almost 200,000.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.127
That crowd will be very pro-Renegade.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.588
How many views was that?

13:18.380 --> 13:19.548
A quarter million.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.468
They've turned her into a folk hero.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.346
Beloved by the simple people
of the village.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.640
We can't execute her tomorrow.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.351
Not in the park,
probably not publicly at all.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.228
It has to be public!

13:33.896 --> 13:34.980
Commander.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.485
What is the one thing that can't happen?

13:41.779 --> 13:42.988
We've talked about this.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.032
A riot.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.368
And why is that?

13:50.162 --> 13:51.622
'Cause we're badly outnumbered.

13:51.747 --> 13:52.665
Why else?

13:52.748 --> 13:55.543
-You've made your point, Hobbs.
-Because we do not know

13:55.876 --> 13:57.336
how our men will react.

13:57.419 --> 14:00.005
Will they fire indiscriminately
into a crowd?

14:02.049 --> 14:03.801
That's what it's going to take.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.470
Fine, I'll take care of this right now.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.138
Commander, if I may.

14:09.557 --> 14:13.143
We simply move the execution
from noon to 9:00 a.m.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.938
We can do it
at our warehouse by the wharf.

14:16.021 --> 14:19.900
We'll film everything and release it
once the city has calmed

14:19.984 --> 14:21.068
a bit.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.906
Then it's decided?

14:27.283 --> 14:28.742
Then it is decided.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.125
I am so proud of you, Blaine. Proud of the man you've become,

14:38.294 --> 14:40.421
a businessman, an innovator,

14:40.713 --> 14:41.922
and soon

14:43.215 --> 14:45.175
a founding father of a zombie republic.

14:45.342 --> 14:48.053
Most of what's good about you
comes from your mother.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.431
But, by God, the ability to lead,

14:50.639 --> 14:52.057
that you got from me.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.519
I have a surprise for you.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.230
-Donald, bring up my guest.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.399
Coming.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.864
Son, this is Enzo Lambert,
inspector for Fillmore-Graves.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.157
At your service.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.075
I know who he is. Why is he here?

15:10.159 --> 15:12.369
Because the inspector is on our side.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.164
He's been secretly working on our behalf.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.374
He brought us a peace offering.
Blaine, you wanna see?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.500
Sure.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.796
It's Crybaby Carl,

15:22.963 --> 15:24.924
out on good behavior.

15:25.925 --> 15:26.884
What's up, boss?

15:27.301 --> 15:30.554
A zombie shouldn't serve time
for killing a human

15:30.638 --> 15:34.141
any more than a human
should serve time for ordering a steak.

15:34.224 --> 15:37.937
<i>Monsieur</i> Lambert has been working
on my behalf for weeks, Blaine.

15:38.270 --> 15:43.108
He has some thoughts for how best
to get our people out of Seattle.

15:43.692 --> 15:44.902
And how's that?

15:45.152 --> 15:47.321
There is no safe way.

15:47.404 --> 15:50.240
But there is a thoroughfare
that is safer than most.

15:50.324 --> 15:54.036
It is guarded by a unit led
by an ineffective lieutenant.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.081
He is so loathed and disrespected
by his men

15:57.164 --> 15:59.208
that they have completely lost
their discipline.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.376
That sounds promising.

16:01.669 --> 16:05.005
Tomorrow morning, the bulk
of the Fillmore-Graves fighting force

16:05.089 --> 16:08.968
will be attending the execution
of the new Renegade.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.971
You should take your people at that point.

16:12.221 --> 16:15.099
You will meet only token resistance
at our gates.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.351
What do you say, Pops?

16:18.894 --> 16:21.063
Seems the stars have aligned.

16:25.693 --> 16:31.281
In five, four, three,  two, one.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.952
Drop what you're doing.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.831
Your life as you know it is over.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.292
Come on, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.921
Major, change of plans.
Big change of plans.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.804
I just got word.
You're not gonna believe it.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.265
Curtis is down at the park.
He says there's already close

16:56.348 --> 16:58.308
to a thousand pro-Renegade supporters.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.269
-We may have a shot.
-Yeah.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.146
What do you suppose is going on there?

17:07.109 --> 17:09.236
Let me get everyone's attention.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.698
I just got word from my source

17:12.781 --> 17:14.658
that Fillmore-Graves
is moving the execution

17:14.742 --> 17:17.453
to a warehouse they own
on Colorado and Hines.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.329
It gets worse.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.331
They switched times on us.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.376
They've moved it up three hours.

17:24.626 --> 17:25.586
Mmm-mmm.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.505
No. Mmm-mmm.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.550
No, no, no, this will not happen.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.927
This cannot happen, no.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.596
Absolutely not.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.641
Where are they heading?

17:40.350 --> 17:43.729
Now, we're going to make this using
whole brains that we've chunked.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.522
Ah. Oh!

17:45.647 --> 17:48.901
Mmm. I'm getting hints of memories
of backyard barbecues

17:48.984 --> 17:51.278
-and cocoa by the fire.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.822
-Something I don't recognize.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.449
I believe that's domesticity.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.950
Hey, you're not allowed
to be in here.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.662
I believe we're getting
a visit from the acting mayor.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.706
What?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.667
Where am I

18:05.751 --> 18:07.002
Uh, the one with the red light, honey.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.462
-Okay.
-This is happening.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.923
Zoom in on one.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.176
You got this.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.263
In 58 minutes,
Fillmore-Graves will execute

18:18.347 --> 18:20.224
two members of the Underground Railroad,

18:21.558 --> 18:24.436
including the one known as Renegade.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.397
I know many of you have seen
the documentary

18:28.774 --> 18:30.109
about the work she does.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.403
If you're serious about living in a city

18:33.529 --> 18:36.240
where zombies and humans
co-exist peacefully,

18:36.615 --> 18:38.742
then head down to Fillmore-Graves'
warehouse at...

18:39.743 --> 18:40.953
At, uh...

18:41.036 --> 18:42.329
Uh, Colorado and Hines.

18:42.412 --> 18:43.914
At Colorado and Hines.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.207
Right now.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.458
Thank you.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.004
My license was taken away. It's a long story.
Can I ride with you two?

18:52.714 --> 18:53.549
Yeah.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.846
-Uh, once the chunks have browned...

19:07.896 --> 19:09.356
It's happening.

19:10.274 --> 19:13.360
Don E. posted your video 15 minutes ago.
Your followers,

19:13.902 --> 19:15.529
they're headed to gate six.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.491
They're shooting at us.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.494
I can't see what's happening.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.288
That's why we're here.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.791
From this rooftop, we can see the gates

19:27.875 --> 19:29.376
and even the road beyond it.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.503
We'll be able to track their progress.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.839
-Yeah.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.925
We're leaders, son.
We need to be with our people.

19:38.218 --> 19:41.263
Generals of armies don't command
from the front line.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.602
Sorry, buddy, you can't park here.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.103
SWAT's taken over this alley.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.440
Unless you want me stabbing your horse
with a ballpoint pen,

19:51.523 --> 19:53.150
you need to lay off my car.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.485
Okay, you and you haircut--

20:07.873 --> 20:10.250
Dad, do not risk your life.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.919
Come up to the rooftop.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.214
When zombies inhabit this entire country,
they'll need you.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.174
I plan on surviving.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.135
God didn't give me a sign
only to let me die.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.224
-Dad.
-This is my flock.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.726
And when I'm gone,
they will be your flock.

20:27.809 --> 20:32.272
Who would we be if we didn't join them now
in this hour of greatest peril?

20:32.439 --> 20:33.690
Alive!

20:35.359 --> 20:36.818
We'd be alive, Dad.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.779
We'd be cowards.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.782
Say you aren't going
to disappoint me, son.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.078
Those brains falling from the sky?

20:46.620 --> 20:47.996
It wasn't a sign, Dad.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.875
That was just Don E. and Tanner
shoving frozen brains

20:51.959 --> 20:53.252
into a wood chipper.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.212
I made that happen.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.588
Not God.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.304
I'm glad your mother isn't alive to see
what kind of man you've become.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.514
Don't say that.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.183
Dad. Dad, wait.

21:11.728 --> 21:12.938
Wear this.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.106
Please.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.275
You wear it, coward.

21:16.858 --> 21:19.361
You're already dead to me! Hyah!

21:20.779 --> 21:22.656
To the wall!

21:33.959 --> 21:36.211
We are positioned
about a mile outside the wall

21:36.295 --> 21:38.338
in an alley just off 8th Avenue.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.173
Those explosions you hear

21:40.257 --> 21:43.260
are landmines being tripped by zombies
who have ventured off

21:43.343 --> 21:44.469
the main thoroughfare.

21:44.928 --> 21:48.223
The zombies' main path
out of Seattle will bring them here,

21:48.307 --> 21:50.892
where they will meet
heavy machine gun fire.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.687
The tank just rolled in this morning.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.605
Frame up on those two.

21:56.773 --> 22:00.152
The army first received word
about the possibility of a zombie exodus

22:00.235 --> 22:02.195
from that man in the blue cape.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.614
I haven't been able to get a name,

22:04.698 --> 22:08.577
but I'm told that he's security chief
for Fillmore-Graves.

22:09.369 --> 22:13.832
Fillmore-Graves,
it appears, is hoping to resuscitate

22:14.458 --> 22:17.169
a sometimes fraught relationship
with Washington,

22:17.252 --> 22:19.796
even at the cost of many
of their fellow zombies.

22:20.839 --> 22:24.343
Was... Those are...
Okay, those were the smoke grenades.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.471
We were told that our soldiers
would deploy smoke

22:27.554 --> 22:28.805
when the zombies were close

22:28.889 --> 22:30.307
in an attempt to disorient them.

22:30.766 --> 22:34.728
By now, the zombies
will be able to smell human brains.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.064
Our human brains.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.649
Uh, not really.

22:41.818 --> 22:42.652
Steady!

22:43.195 --> 22:44.988
We've got incoming!

22:46.114 --> 22:48.658
Weapons tight! Prepare to fire!

22:48.742 --> 22:51.078
Charge!

22:52.662 --> 22:54.164
-Fire!

23:08.929 --> 23:10.972
<i>Liv Moore understood</i>
<i>the stakes when she...</i>

23:11.264 --> 23:12.390
What are you watching?

23:12.808 --> 23:13.975
A documentary.

23:14.810 --> 23:15.894
The one about her.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.897
Renegade.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.735
It's kind of a tearjerker.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.489
Let me see.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.034
You really haven't seen it?

23:33.537 --> 23:35.330
Then you're the last person in Seattle.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.416
<i>Mommy!</i>

23:46.716 --> 23:48.176
Sounds like we have company.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.719
Word got out.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.222
We've got a drone up in the air.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.809
A couple hundred or so?

23:56.101 --> 23:57.394
And growing by the minute.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.771
At least it's not the thousands
gathering at the park.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.440
If the door fails,

24:03.150 --> 24:05.652
then the soldiers with machine guns
should do the trick.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.244
Men and women of Fillmore-Graves,

24:16.163 --> 24:19.040
if anyone out there not wearing a uniform
makes it inside this building,

24:19.124 --> 24:20.917
it is your duty to shoot to kill.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.795
This is a lawful execution.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.715
Levon Patch is guilty of murder.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.675
He murdered one of our own.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.135
Jeffrey Copperfield.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.678
Jeffrey Copperfield?

24:32.053 --> 24:34.639
Olivia Moore is guilty of human smuggling.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.726
Because of her crimes, zombies starve.

24:51.698 --> 24:52.657
Keep pulling.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.784
Major!

24:55.702 --> 24:57.329
Clive--

25:23.271 --> 25:25.440
Any brief final words?

25:27.567 --> 25:31.655
Fillmore-Graves, you have the power
to make humans not fear zombies--

25:43.083 --> 25:44.125
Clean this up.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.890
Open it. It's opening!

26:00.976 --> 26:02.185
Keep pulling!

26:04.396 --> 26:07.190
No!

26:07.357 --> 26:08.650
Take him down.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.035
Don't shoot!

27:12.714 --> 27:14.382
Where is the Commander?

27:17.594 --> 27:19.596
Gate six has been overrun.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.735
Commander.

27:35.653 --> 27:36.863
Major.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.657
What do you want to do about gate six?

27:40.075 --> 27:41.618
I want someone else to figure it out.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.412
Too bad. It's yours now, like it or not.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.633
Shut every other gate down completely.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.219
Send all available personnel to gate six.

27:59.677 --> 28:01.179
Find us a Humvee,
and let's get down there.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.514
Yes, sir.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.265
-Jurgens, find me a Humvee.
-Yes, sir.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.726
Sullivan, get word to all
other gates to shut down completely.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.437
Lance and Carter, get your squads
armed up, and let's go!

28:17.278 --> 28:20.240
Over a thousand zombies died today.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.284
They were led outside
the wall by this man.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.787
<i>Angus McDonough had been</i>

28:25.870 --> 28:28.915
<i>a spiritual leader</i>
<i>to the undead in Seattle.</i>

28:28.998 --> 28:31.501
<i>He believed zombies</i>
<i>would inherit the Earth,</i>

28:31.584 --> 28:34.295
<i>and who knows? He may still be right.</i>

28:34.504 --> 28:37.924
<i>But U.S. Army personnel</i>
<i>made sure that Angus himself</i>

28:38.091 --> 28:40.218
<i>wouldn't be the one to lead them there.</i>

28:40.301 --> 28:45.598
<i>After the battle ended,</i>
<i>it was up to soldiers to shoot each zombie</i>

28:45.682 --> 28:47.016
<i>in the head.</i>

28:47.517 --> 28:51.938
<i>And when a group of soldiers came across</i>
<i>Seattle's self-declared zombie prophet,</i>

28:52.480 --> 28:55.984
<i>they made sure he wouldn't cause</i>
<i>any more problems.</i>

28:59.612 --> 29:00.989
<i>If you believe--</i>

29:03.867 --> 29:05.243
Levon is dead.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.871
Isobel is dead.

29:09.497 --> 29:11.374
Lowell, Drake.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.045
I just wanna go away somewhere I

29:17.005 --> 29:19.883
won't hurt anyone else,
somewhere I can't be hurt.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.179
Well, I've got some
good news for you.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.017
I can make you human.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.189
Are you serious?

29:35.023 --> 29:36.649
100% serious.

29:37.275 --> 29:40.028
80% certain it will work.

29:41.654 --> 29:43.323
You won't be Renegade anymore.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.366
Good.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.828
What's that look for?
You don't think that I've done enough?

29:50.246 --> 29:51.498
You're not done yet.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.374
I don't even remember the mission.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.335
It was simple.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.296
Convince humans they could live in peace

29:58.379 --> 30:00.548
side-by-side with zombies. That's all.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.467
Yeah, that's all.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.930
I don't want this anymore, Ravi.

30:07.013 --> 30:12.185
Hundreds of people who don't even know you
charged straight at armed soldiers.

30:12.310 --> 30:15.313
They did this to save your life.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.981
But guess what.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.608
I saved my own life.

30:21.736 --> 30:23.446
Where did you get the new cure?

30:23.988 --> 30:26.115
Isobel's brain is the cure.

30:26.616 --> 30:27.534
Whoa.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.161
Well, it is for rats.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.830
Then let's get this over with.

30:33.456 --> 30:34.749
Oh, uh...

30:35.834 --> 30:38.753
Everyone thought you might sleep
until tomorrow.

30:38.837 --> 30:39.963
Everyone?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.006
Who else is here?

30:42.549 --> 30:43.591
If you can let her know that--

30:43.675 --> 30:44.634
By "her," you mean me?

30:45.927 --> 30:47.387
What do I need to know?

30:48.471 --> 30:50.723
Liv, Major is the new commander
at Fillmore-Graves.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.517
Congratulations.

30:53.059 --> 30:56.312
I was just telling Peyton
that we've instituted a change in policy.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.731
Smuggle all the humans in you want.

30:58.982 --> 31:02.402
We encourage it.
Your enemy won't be Fillmore-Graves.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.737
It's the U.S. Army
that will be standing in your way.

31:05.488 --> 31:07.156
They're still dead-set on stopping you.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.534
They won't be stopping me. I'm retired.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.703
-And in a couple hours,

31:11.786 --> 31:13.037
I won't even be a zombie.

31:13.621 --> 31:16.207
The same cure
I saw you two give Major, I assume?

31:16.291 --> 31:17.458
No, something new.

31:17.625 --> 31:18.751
Mass producible? Far from it.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.718
Liv,

31:27.927 --> 31:30.805
I am so sorry we didn't get there in time
to save your boyfriend.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.016
Me, too.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.227
His name was Levon.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.397
And he'd be alive
if you hadn't kidnapped me.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.149
I know.

31:42.650 --> 31:43.735
But you'd be dead.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.115
See you.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.457
Liv, he risked everything to save you.

31:57.874 --> 31:58.958
True.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.337
I know who he is,

32:03.129 --> 32:04.756
even if he forgets sometimes.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.302
I'm ready to be human again.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.680
Who's coming with me?

32:17.936 --> 32:19.938
Do I eat the whole thing?

32:22.774 --> 32:24.859
What's the first thing
you wanna do once you're human?

32:26.152 --> 32:27.362
Escape the city.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.697
-Go somewhere where no one knows me.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.658
Never date, get fat.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.284
I don't believe you.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.454
Uh, there's something big
going on upstairs.

32:36.537 --> 32:38.331
Our presence is required.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.501
Really

32:41.709 --> 32:42.961
Oh, it is.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.431
What the hell?

32:55.515 --> 32:58.184
You two are getting married?
No one tells me anything.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.395
It was pretty spur of the moment.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.856
Get up here, you pain in the ass
and be my maid of honor.

33:03.940 --> 33:04.941
Aw.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.904
Ravi, would you mind...

33:10.238 --> 33:13.574
Would you mind getting the keys
out of my jacket pocket and moving my car?

33:13.658 --> 33:15.994
-I'm double-parked.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.705
-I'm kidding, Doc.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.248
Stand here and be my best man.

33:25.670 --> 33:26.671
I'll remember that.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.297
Shall we proceed?

33:28.965 --> 33:30.383
-Good to go.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.552
Dearly beloved,

33:32.969 --> 33:37.932
we are here to get through this thing
called personalized wedding vows.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.183
Boo.

33:39.267 --> 33:40.435
They're really short.

33:45.773 --> 33:47.859
I, Dallas Anne Bozzio,

33:48.526 --> 33:50.778
promise to care for Clive Babineaux

33:51.362 --> 33:52.447
only in health

33:53.239 --> 33:56.659
because we'll be zombies,
so we won't get sick.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.246
And,

34:01.122 --> 34:02.790
though we can't have kids,

34:03.499 --> 34:05.877
I will attempt to bring magic

34:06.294 --> 34:07.754
and a sense of wonder

34:07.920 --> 34:09.213
into our marriage.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.465
Aw.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.176
And if you're still missing kids,

34:13.676 --> 34:15.636
I'll let you spank me from time to time.

34:19.348 --> 34:20.475
That's beautiful.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.143
Clive.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.354
I, Clive Babineaux,

34:26.064 --> 34:27.231
promise

34:27.523 --> 34:30.401
to spank you only
until I hear the safe word,

34:31.069 --> 34:34.280
though, for the life of me,
I can't remember us having a safe word.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.660
I promise to never make you feel sad

34:40.286 --> 34:42.038
that I have to eat brains

34:42.789 --> 34:44.457
and that I won't be a father.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.044
This is my choice.

34:50.963 --> 34:53.925
I want to be your husband

34:54.008 --> 34:58.471
more than some entitled
<i>Minecraft-</i>playing brat's dad.

34:58.721 --> 34:59.931
Aw.

35:00.556 --> 35:05.436
Then by the power vested in me
by the Temple of Ms. Oolachurch.com,

35:05.561 --> 35:08.481
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

35:09.607 --> 35:10.441
Whoo!

35:10.525 --> 35:12.110
You may now kiss the bride.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.826
And now if you'll excuse us,

35:20.451 --> 35:24.831
I am taking this man home where
I'm gonna literally sex him to death.

35:42.723 --> 35:43.724
Hey.

35:45.351 --> 35:47.228
I didn't get you a wedding gift.

35:47.395 --> 35:50.439
That's okay, Liv.
We didn't give people much of a heads-up.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.567
But I know what I wanna give you. And I think you're gonna like it.

35:59.073 --> 36:00.032
Clive,

36:01.200 --> 36:02.785
how would you like to be a father?

36:08.082 --> 36:09.458
What's going on over there?

36:17.091 --> 36:19.385
I think Liv just gave away her cure.

36:25.141 --> 36:26.809
Isn't that just like her?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.444
I really hate this game, Blaine.

36:37.653 --> 36:40.156
It's $500 a spin. Come on.

36:48.789 --> 36:51.500
Blaine, are you in here?
-Candy, don't.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.003
-Ooh.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.590
Candy, out.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.386
Three grand.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.096
In my check.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.432
No withholding.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.400
Blaine, what the hell, man?

37:16.901 --> 37:19.153
So the plan didn't work.

37:20.112 --> 37:24.158
So we don't have the money
to cover all the payments

37:24.242 --> 37:25.660
on the properties we've bought,

37:25.743 --> 37:28.663
so the bank will probably foreclose
on The Scratching Post,

37:28.746 --> 37:30.289
Shady Plots, and Romeros.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.668
We've been through worse.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.214
He rode into battle,
believing that God would protect him.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.052
Your old man

37:43.970 --> 37:45.471
was a son of a bitch.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.432
To hell with him.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.977
Excuse me. Gentlemen?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.645
What the hell do you want?

37:54.689 --> 37:56.274
What do I do about Hobbs?

37:59.568 --> 38:00.903
Head on a spike.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.155
You know, he came to me
before all this went down,

38:03.239 --> 38:04.824
asking if I would take Chase's job.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.535
Deep freeze, then.

38:07.618 --> 38:10.788
Commander, I've retrieved the men
you wanted to see.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.668
Commander, huh?

38:16.252 --> 38:17.378
Quite a day.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.965
And why have we been summoned,
Lord Commander?

38:21.048 --> 38:23.968
I'm sure you two have heard that we will
no longer be receiving brain shipments

38:24.051 --> 38:25.594
from our friends in the United States.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.515
You now possess the most valuable asset
in all of New Seattle.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.227
You know how to smuggle brains
into the city.

38:34.353 --> 38:37.398
We're gonna need you to increase
the flow of brains by a factor of 20. It'll be dangerous, but you'll have
the muscle of Fillmore-Graves

38:41.527 --> 38:42.737
working on your behalf.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.781
I could ask you to help us
because failure means

38:45.865 --> 38:47.908
the destruction of our zombie homeland,

38:48.993 --> 38:50.745
but I know that wouldn't count
for much with you two.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.705
You can't pay the rent with patriotism.

38:52.788 --> 38:54.540
Instead, what I'll offer you is wealth

38:54.874 --> 38:57.460
and, better than wealth, respectability.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.503
Where you were once pirates,

38:59.920 --> 39:01.422
scoundrels, villains...

39:02.089 --> 39:05.134
Why mince words?
A couple of low-life murderers.

39:05.634 --> 39:08.304
A year from now, you'll be patriots.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.931
There'll be statues of you
in the town square.

39:11.015 --> 39:14.018
Zombie children will be taught
nursery rhymes about your exploits.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.437
Zombie teenagers will go to DeBeers High.

39:16.937 --> 39:20.107
There'll be Donnie's Deep-Fried Brain
stands all across the city.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.406
All of our debts, forgiven.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.699
Uh, maybe we should--

39:28.866 --> 39:29.825
Done.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.161
Dilly-dilly.

39:34.121 --> 39:37.875
Clive sent me a GIF of Dale
shoveling ice cream in her face.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.383
This was a bad idea, coming here.

39:46.425 --> 39:47.927
Too many memories of Levon.

39:48.260 --> 39:51.013
Well, at least, tell people goodbye, Liv.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.015
Maybe "thank you"?

39:54.058 --> 39:55.184
Where is everyone?

39:57.269 --> 39:59.647
Are people gonna wanna come
to Seattle to get saved now that they know

39:59.730 --> 40:02.024
we may not have enough brains
to feed every zombie?

40:02.274 --> 40:04.151
Applications keep rolling in.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.530
Whoever turns out to be the new Renegade
will have plenty of customers.

40:13.577 --> 40:14.703
What are you doing in here?

40:15.371 --> 40:16.914
This place is depressing as hell.

40:16.997 --> 40:19.083
We don't have to worry
about Fillmore-Graves anymore.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.668
Let's meet out by the pool.

40:21.001 --> 40:22.253
This place has a pool?

40:22.336 --> 40:24.296
Yes. Haven't you seen it?

40:24.380 --> 40:27.383
Let's go knock back a few,
see if anyone wants to skinny dip.

40:57.621 --> 41:00.040
Still want to run off to some place
where no one knows who you are?

41:03.127 --> 41:06.172
Zombies and humans
all believing we can work together.

41:07.548 --> 41:10.176
What should we do first, Renegade?
