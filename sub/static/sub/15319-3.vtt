00:00.117 --> 00:01.758
Previously on
<i>Sanctuary...</i>

00:01.783 --> 00:04.001
It's amazing. I always
thought I was alone.

00:05.097 --> 00:06.378
Now I know it's not true.

00:07.615 --> 00:09.516
- I want you to stay.
- I want you to come with me--

00:09.518 --> 00:11.684
I grew up in an
institution for abnormals.

00:11.686 --> 00:13.820
The Sanctuary's more than that.
It's a family.

00:13.822 --> 00:15.955
The abnormals are
moving in formation.

00:15.957 --> 00:17.223
Someone, or something

00:17.225 --> 00:19.153
is in complete control
of these beings.

00:19.155 --> 00:20.744
What the hell
happened to you?

00:20.746 --> 00:23.217
You were out of
communication for hours.

00:23.219 --> 00:25.816
More like years, actually.

00:25.818 --> 00:26.817
Years?

00:26.819 --> 00:29.115
113, to be precise.

00:31.285 --> 00:32.949
I went through the files
on Addison's team.

00:32.951 --> 00:34.150
A lot of Ivy league
educations,

00:34.152 --> 00:35.285
state department
resumes,

00:35.287 --> 00:36.761
no marriages or kids.

00:36.763 --> 00:38.630
"Orphans preferred,"
lovely.

00:38.632 --> 00:42.075
What do we know about
this Addison fellow himself?

00:42.077 --> 00:44.046
He's the U.N. Security
Council's top troubleshooter.

00:44.048 --> 00:45.683
Harvard law,

00:45.685 --> 00:47.220
Brookings Institute,
The Hague.

00:47.222 --> 00:48.557
He's advised world leaders
on everything

00:48.559 --> 00:49.695
from Iraq, to Libya,

00:49.697 --> 00:51.330
to the B.P. Oil spill
in the Gulf.

00:51.332 --> 00:53.198
Wow, now he's here
to deal with us.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.333
If he wasn't
such a pit bull,

00:54.335 --> 00:55.736
I'd be flattered.

00:55.738 --> 00:56.570
Hmm.

00:58.140 --> 00:59.774
Terminal farm's
up and running

00:59.776 --> 01:00.943
in the research lab.

01:00.945 --> 01:02.412
Are you sure you want me
to give these guys

01:02.414 --> 01:04.083
complete access
to our current protocols?

01:04.084 --> 01:05.417
Bunch of strangers
poking around,

01:05.419 --> 01:06.252
I don't like it.

01:06.254 --> 01:07.623
Nobody does,

01:07.625 --> 01:08.890
but it's not like
we have a choice.

01:08.892 --> 01:10.025
What about
the "tea with Magnus,

01:10.027 --> 01:11.060
photo op with
a mermaid" option?

01:11.062 --> 01:11.928
That ain't gonna fly
this time.

01:11.930 --> 01:13.263
Everything's changed

01:13.265 --> 01:14.732
since the Calderas
to Hollow Earth were breached.

01:14.734 --> 01:16.033
High-level people
need reassurance

01:16.035 --> 01:18.673
that the situation
is under control.

01:18.675 --> 01:20.776
You've secured
the research database?

01:20.778 --> 01:22.178
Done.

01:22.180 --> 01:23.113
Current security
and user activity

01:23.115 --> 01:24.315
are open access.

01:24.317 --> 01:25.383
The rest is behind
an invisible firewall.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.686
And I'll be
monitoring their traffic

01:27.688 --> 01:28.755
full time,

01:28.757 --> 01:29.890
so we'll know right away

01:29.892 --> 01:31.158
if they try anything
off the hook.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.026
All secure
on the residential levels?

01:33.028 --> 01:34.094
No stragglers?

01:34.096 --> 01:35.262
Tight as a drum.

01:35.264 --> 01:36.363
Total lockdown
in 40 minutes.

01:36.365 --> 01:38.333
Good job, everyone.

01:38.335 --> 01:42.003
Right, one more walkthrough,
and we'll reconvene here at--

01:43.639 --> 01:45.806
What, an hour
ahead of schedule?

01:45.808 --> 01:48.108
No, there's no way.
Gate defenses are up.

01:48.110 --> 01:49.810
There is no way he just
walked to the front door.

01:49.812 --> 01:51.144
Yeah, see?

01:51.146 --> 01:53.046
Gate was opened
with an approved code.

01:53.048 --> 01:54.214
Mine...

01:55.817 --> 01:57.652
Well, who'd you give it to?

01:57.654 --> 01:59.054
No one.

02:00.691 --> 02:02.091
To the best of my knowledge.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.973 --> 02:15.874
Erika!

02:16.976 --> 02:19.845
This is a surprise.

02:19.847 --> 02:21.313
Hello, all.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.948
Sorry to intrude.

02:23.950 --> 02:25.683
Hi, honey.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.787
Wow, it's really
good to see you.

02:29.789 --> 02:31.255
Uh...

02:31.257 --> 02:33.290
Did we have plans
to get together?

02:33.292 --> 02:36.294
I have some news
that couldn't wait.

02:36.296 --> 02:38.096
Okay.

02:38.098 --> 02:40.399
I wanted to tell you
in person...

02:40.401 --> 02:41.968
Great, good.

02:41.970 --> 02:43.269
It's just that we have
this U.N. inspection team

02:43.271 --> 02:44.904
due in an hour,

02:44.906 --> 02:47.041
and I'm installing this
whole new mirror array

02:47.043 --> 02:48.209
so that they can access our
system without actually--

02:48.211 --> 02:50.077
Henry.

02:51.346 --> 02:52.380
Stopping?

02:54.050 --> 02:55.417
Listening.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.126
You're going to be a father.

03:10.466 --> 03:11.332
Oh.

03:27.279 --> 03:30.181
This type of fish
is not good to eat.

03:30.183 --> 03:32.417
Well, the man we seek
needs a special diet.

03:32.419 --> 03:35.320
Then this is your man.

03:38.023 --> 03:39.057
You probably want to
get out of here

03:39.059 --> 03:40.058
before things go down.

03:56.523 --> 03:58.090
Yeah, and then
the whole thing went to hell.

03:58.092 --> 04:00.620
So, this being they were
looking for was called a...

04:00.621 --> 04:02.754
A Crixorum.
It's a Hollow Earth abnormal.

04:02.756 --> 04:04.489
Made top of the Red List
after the invasion.

04:04.491 --> 04:05.457
How so?

04:05.459 --> 04:07.091
Crazy huge
psychic powers.

04:07.093 --> 04:09.093
The Doc's convinced he's the one

04:09.095 --> 04:11.496
who coordinated
the abnormal uprising.

04:11.498 --> 04:14.866
He talked to three armies
at once, with his mind.

04:14.868 --> 04:18.437
How in the world do you
stop someone like that?

04:18.439 --> 04:20.872
Well, he's one guy,
so there are ways.

04:20.874 --> 04:23.075
Problem is, how do you stop
the next army he controls?

04:23.077 --> 04:24.710
You know, someone
like Kim Jong Il,

04:24.712 --> 04:25.612
or the next Bin Ladin...

04:25.614 --> 04:26.813
They'd become invincible.

04:26.815 --> 04:28.215
Exactly.

04:28.217 --> 04:29.182
Which is why the Doc
needed to get there first

04:29.184 --> 04:30.417
and bring him back

04:30.419 --> 04:31.619
before he did
more damage.

04:31.621 --> 04:32.920
I take it that didn't happen.

04:32.922 --> 04:35.790
No. Not at all.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.225
Whole mission went sideways.

04:37.227 --> 04:38.593
Next thing we know,
boom, hammer comes down.

04:38.595 --> 04:40.494
U.N. gives us two days' notice

04:40.496 --> 04:42.830
they're coming in with
an investigation team

04:42.832 --> 04:44.131
to go through
our underwear drawers.

04:44.133 --> 04:46.233
And then I drop
my little bombshell.

04:46.235 --> 04:48.935
Oh, no, no, I didn't
mean that at all.

04:50.905 --> 04:52.572
This is, easily,

04:52.574 --> 04:54.741
the most amazing
thing I've...

04:54.743 --> 04:57.878
Will be
the most amazing thing, that...

04:57.880 --> 04:58.812
<i>We've</i> ever...

05:00.047 --> 05:01.614
When it finally sinks in.

05:01.616 --> 05:02.881
Yeah, I'm, like,
five minutes

05:02.883 --> 05:04.183
into being a future dad.

05:04.185 --> 05:05.784
I think I deserve
a little slack, maybe.

05:07.154 --> 05:09.654
Take your time.

05:10.923 --> 05:14.925
In the meantime,
what can I do to help?

05:14.927 --> 05:16.827
Oh, shouldn't you
be resting?

05:16.829 --> 05:17.794
You know, in your...?

05:17.796 --> 05:19.696
If you say
"delicate condition",

05:19.698 --> 05:21.198
I'll bite you.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.265
Task me.

05:22.267 --> 05:23.533
You know I have
serious game at coding.

05:23.535 --> 05:25.636
Which I call foreplay.

05:25.638 --> 05:28.072
Which got us into this mess
in the first place.

05:33.044 --> 05:35.045
You're the most amazing
girlfriend ever.

05:36.715 --> 05:37.849
Nice digs.

05:37.851 --> 05:39.250
A little formal.

05:39.252 --> 05:42.153
If you need the name
of a decorator,

05:42.155 --> 05:44.056
I know a fabulous
firm in L.A.

05:44.058 --> 05:47.526
Just did James Cameron's
Aspen estate.

05:47.528 --> 05:49.528
Did you come here
to name-drop?

05:49.530 --> 05:51.865
With Helen Magnus?
Come on, sport, I'd lose.

05:51.867 --> 05:54.034
No, I'm here
to make the call

05:54.036 --> 05:56.569
on whether or not
the Sanctuary

05:56.571 --> 05:58.070
continues to receive
funding and support

05:58.072 --> 05:59.605
from the people
who hired me.

05:59.607 --> 06:01.173
You know, the ones
running the world.

06:01.175 --> 06:02.608
That's quite a team
you've brought with you.

06:02.610 --> 06:04.209
Are they completely
necessary?

06:04.211 --> 06:05.844
Well, if it helps,

06:05.846 --> 06:08.580
think of me as Elliot Ness,
and these guys behind me?

06:08.582 --> 06:09.947
The Untouchables.

06:09.949 --> 06:10.948
If it helps,

06:10.950 --> 06:12.616
Magnus knew
the real Elliot Ness,

06:12.618 --> 06:14.018
and, just going out
on a limb here,

06:14.020 --> 06:15.219
that's not you.

06:15.221 --> 06:16.454
Congratulations, Sport,

06:16.456 --> 06:18.156
you win round one
of "Who Knows Who."

06:18.158 --> 06:20.458
I've arranged
secure terminals

06:20.460 --> 06:22.060
at one of our labs.

06:22.062 --> 06:25.431
My people will be available
for any debriefing you may need.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.900
I love it.

06:27.902 --> 06:28.768
This is Cassidy Turner,

06:28.770 --> 06:29.903
my senior technical
consultant.

06:29.905 --> 06:31.338
Cass, take the team
and get started.

06:31.340 --> 06:33.006
Absolutely.

06:33.008 --> 06:35.275
Help her set up,
will you, Sport?

06:35.277 --> 06:37.277
I'm going to take
the menagerie tour

06:37.279 --> 06:39.246
with Dr. Magnus.

06:39.248 --> 06:41.981
Will, could you please

06:41.983 --> 06:44.950
take Ms. Turner and her team
to the research lab?

06:49.789 --> 06:51.389
If you call me "Sport"
once more,

06:51.391 --> 06:53.891
I'm going to
knock your teeth in.

06:53.893 --> 06:55.126
Welcome to the Sanctuary.

06:55.128 --> 06:57.194
Follow me, everyone.

07:01.366 --> 07:05.203
This is not a menagerie,
Mr. Addison.

07:05.205 --> 07:06.338
What else
do you call the place

07:06.340 --> 07:08.307
where they keep the monsters
and the freaks?

07:09.744 --> 07:12.344
You're fooling no one
with this tactic.

07:12.346 --> 07:14.180
Come in
as obnoxious as possible,

07:14.182 --> 07:16.115
put us all on the defensive.

07:16.117 --> 07:18.951
Ah, you got me.

07:18.953 --> 07:21.386
You know what I love about
really great tactics?

07:21.388 --> 07:22.654
They work

07:22.656 --> 07:24.822
even when the other guy
sees them coming.

07:36.067 --> 07:38.268
I think you've gotten
very used to

07:38.270 --> 07:40.671
having Carte Blanche
around the world

07:40.673 --> 07:42.306
because you helped
Interpol

07:42.308 --> 07:44.909
take down
a three-headed madman,

07:44.911 --> 07:46.677
or covered up
the squidblood origins

07:46.679 --> 07:48.045
of some President's wife.

07:48.047 --> 07:49.948
Ah...

07:49.950 --> 07:51.116
So this is about my ego.

07:53.386 --> 07:55.654
Doctor, we have
hit and run attacks

07:55.656 --> 07:56.822
by rogue abnormal groups

07:56.824 --> 07:58.224
on Lotus Defense training camps

07:58.226 --> 08:00.860
as well as
civilian casualties

08:00.862 --> 08:03.396
that someone has to explain
to the press.

08:03.398 --> 08:05.332
There's over
a hundred years

08:05.334 --> 08:07.868
of history here, Mr. Addison.

08:07.870 --> 08:08.836
Mmm.

08:08.838 --> 08:09.837
Any chance you'll call me Craig?

08:09.839 --> 08:10.938
None whatsoever.

08:13.442 --> 08:14.409
Monsters?

08:19.949 --> 08:23.284
Sorry, it'll just be
another couple of minutes.

08:23.286 --> 08:24.418
It's okay, Henry.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.119
Everyone knows
this was last minute.

08:25.121 --> 08:26.120
We've got all day.

08:28.057 --> 08:31.192
Okay, that should do it.

08:31.194 --> 08:33.092
Oh, great, more people.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.695
Meet Craig Addison.

08:34.697 --> 08:36.395
U.N. Security Council liaison,

08:36.398 --> 08:38.198
and all round nice guy.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.032
Henry Foss, right?

08:40.034 --> 08:40.933
I love your work.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.068
Aw, thanks.

08:42.070 --> 08:43.703
I mean, whatever.

08:43.705 --> 08:44.937
And this would be..?

08:44.939 --> 08:47.006
Erika Myers, and I already
don't like you.

08:47.008 --> 08:48.740
Yeah, we're, uh, together.

08:48.742 --> 08:50.041
Well, aren't you
the lucky guy?

08:50.043 --> 08:51.776
I trust everything

08:51.778 --> 08:53.011
is to your liking?

08:54.180 --> 08:55.180
Cass?

08:55.182 --> 08:58.883
Uh, well, the system
is a bit archaic,

08:58.885 --> 09:00.251
but I think we can
find our way around.

09:00.253 --> 09:01.219
Um, are you sure?

09:01.221 --> 09:02.154
Because she can be
a little delicate

09:02.156 --> 09:03.956
if you don't understand
her mods--

09:03.958 --> 09:05.190
did you say "archaic"?

09:05.192 --> 09:07.160
Whoa, ho-ho...
What is all this stuff?

09:07.162 --> 09:09.996
Just a few
adaptive peripherals.

09:09.998 --> 09:11.198
Since we're required to do
the work on-site,

09:11.200 --> 09:14.301
without our customized
workstations.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.170
Doc, this is
so uncool.

09:16.172 --> 09:17.871
I agreed to allow
your investigators

09:17.873 --> 09:19.306
short-term access
to our system

09:19.308 --> 09:20.507
using our facilities,

09:20.509 --> 09:23.109
not to set up
an entirely foreign network.

09:23.111 --> 09:24.844
I won't have you
compromise our security,

09:24.846 --> 09:26.878
even unintentionally.

09:27.947 --> 09:29.281
Make do
with what they give you.

09:32.118 --> 09:33.852
Given the things they keep
in the building,

09:33.854 --> 09:35.220
what choice do we have?

09:35.222 --> 09:37.087
What do you mean
by that?

09:37.089 --> 09:38.956
"Things we keep
in the building?"

09:38.958 --> 09:40.191
It's cool, Erika.

09:40.193 --> 09:41.326
Oh, you didn't
get the tour?

09:41.328 --> 09:44.362
The place is crawling
with monsters. Freaks.

09:44.364 --> 09:46.330
You know, stuff that
jumps out at you--

09:47.433 --> 09:49.167
<i>We're not monsters!</i>

09:55.033 --> 09:56.167
Whoa...

09:56.169 --> 09:58.035
Erika! Erika...

09:58.037 --> 09:59.236
Just relax,
just relax...

09:59.238 --> 10:02.072
So not worth it.

10:02.074 --> 10:04.175
I can see why she's
your girlfriend.

10:04.177 --> 10:06.543
Watch yourself, dude.

10:06.545 --> 10:08.011
I take it she's a...

10:08.013 --> 10:09.179
Hyper accelerated
protean,

10:09.181 --> 10:10.481
like Henry.

10:10.483 --> 10:11.715
One of only a few
left in the world.

10:11.717 --> 10:13.317
And she's not usually
like this.

10:13.319 --> 10:15.152
I'm flattered.

10:15.154 --> 10:16.721
Don't be.
The way you judge us!

10:16.723 --> 10:17.988
Okay--

10:17.990 --> 10:19.490
sweetheart...

10:19.492 --> 10:21.358
What's wrong?

10:23.430 --> 10:27.031
I-I couldn't.... I can't...

10:28.668 --> 10:30.535
Okay, what is
the deal with her?

10:30.537 --> 10:31.802
Just give her
a minute.

10:31.804 --> 10:33.704
Doc,
something's not right.

10:33.706 --> 10:35.072
I agree.
Let's get her to isolation.

10:35.074 --> 10:36.541
Come on.

10:40.213 --> 10:43.315
Well, I couldn't feel safer
right now.

10:46.954 --> 10:48.087
When you and your aunt

10:48.089 --> 10:50.123
were helping the Lycans
in Oldham,

10:50.125 --> 10:51.825
did you see
many children born?

10:51.827 --> 10:53.193
No.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.195
Aunt Lillian said it was because
our race was so ancient.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.331
That we were reaching
the end of our run.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.732
But now I think

10:59.734 --> 11:01.801
it must have been a side effect
of the medications.

11:01.803 --> 11:03.369
I agree.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.171
By suppressing
your transformative DNA,

11:05.173 --> 11:07.873
she was suppressing
your fertility as well.

11:09.642 --> 11:11.376
This might be
the first Lycan baby

11:11.378 --> 11:12.477
since my parents died.

11:14.247 --> 11:15.514
Okay, but, um,
what just happened?

11:15.516 --> 11:17.683
It seems odd, yes.

11:17.685 --> 11:20.620
Your body should be
locking your cells

11:20.622 --> 11:21.887
to protect the fetus.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.289
You shouldn't be able
to transform at all.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.491
Right, 'cause
when she does,

11:24.493 --> 11:25.692
her insides
transform as well.

11:25.694 --> 11:26.693
So, um, the baby...

11:26.695 --> 11:28.829
Fetal readings
are completely normal.

11:28.831 --> 11:30.831
The embryo is healthy.

11:30.833 --> 11:32.400
But I do think

11:32.402 --> 11:33.801
that the pregnancy hormones

11:33.803 --> 11:35.403
are interfering with
your ability

11:35.405 --> 11:36.371
to manage emotional triggers.

11:39.508 --> 11:40.875
Right, I'm going to
run some bloodwork,

11:40.877 --> 11:43.811
see if I can find
a treatable chemical imbalance.

11:43.813 --> 11:45.379
In the meantime,

11:45.381 --> 11:47.781
I hope you'll be
comfortable here.

11:47.783 --> 11:49.849
I'm sorry.

11:49.851 --> 11:51.651
I didn't mean to make things
harder for you.

11:51.653 --> 11:54.186
Ah, that's okay.
It was pretty bad-ass.

11:54.188 --> 11:55.554
I wanted to
rip his throat out myself.

11:59.661 --> 12:00.760
Duty calls.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.362
Henry,

12:02.364 --> 12:03.830
you stay here with Erika.

12:03.832 --> 12:04.798
She's the priority.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.367
I'll, uh,

12:06.369 --> 12:09.304
keep an eye on the Geek Squad.

12:09.306 --> 12:11.906
No offense.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.649
Addison asked for coffee.

12:21.651 --> 12:23.818
Philistine.

12:23.820 --> 12:26.487
I trust you did your best
to make him feel welcome?

12:26.489 --> 12:28.155
Yeah, I pretended
I didn't know how to talk.

12:28.157 --> 12:29.590
I don't suppose
he fell for it.

12:29.592 --> 12:31.157
He started
dissing the rays.

12:31.159 --> 12:32.425
Ooh, ouch.

12:32.427 --> 12:33.326
Yeah, we had words.

12:33.328 --> 12:35.228
Oh, good, there you are.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.796
How are our guests
settling in?

12:36.798 --> 12:39.198
A little bit too comfortably
for my liking.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.434
It was inevitable, Qill.

12:41.436 --> 12:43.236
The more they see,
the more convinced they'll be

12:43.238 --> 12:44.738
that the Sanctuary

12:44.740 --> 12:45.872
has nothing to hide.

12:45.874 --> 12:47.274
Okay, I know
that you're all Zen

12:47.276 --> 12:50.478
from your 113 years
on the mountaintop, but me?

12:50.480 --> 12:51.746
I'm just a normal uptight guy.

12:51.748 --> 12:52.580
Yeah.

12:52.582 --> 12:54.449
We could waste
a lot of energy

12:54.451 --> 12:55.416
fighting this battle,

12:55.418 --> 12:56.885
but there's a long war ahead.

12:56.887 --> 12:59.754
If you start calling me
"young grasshopper,"

12:59.756 --> 13:00.888
I'm quitting.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.127
Three weeks ago,

13:06.129 --> 13:08.196
we damn near had the abnormal
apocalypse on our hands.

13:08.198 --> 13:09.497
Which we averted.

13:09.499 --> 13:10.699
You pulled the nose
of the plane up

13:10.701 --> 13:12.768
about 10 seconds before
it hit the ground, yeah.

13:12.770 --> 13:15.904
Congratulations.

13:15.906 --> 13:19.775
Not exactly
confidence-inspiring,

13:19.777 --> 13:21.977
and now we've got
a thousand or more abnormals

13:21.979 --> 13:23.878
roaming the surface unchecked.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.147
You can be assured

13:25.149 --> 13:26.982
we have the best teams
worldwide dealing with them.

13:26.984 --> 13:28.783
The point is, you
and your amazing worldwide teams

13:28.785 --> 13:30.919
failed to contain them
in the first place.

13:30.921 --> 13:32.587
Lotus made
their own enemies

13:32.589 --> 13:34.923
by attacking abnormal tribes
at the Caldera sites.

13:34.925 --> 13:36.324
And you guaranteed
that if they stood down,

13:36.326 --> 13:37.893
you would eliminate the threat.

13:39.529 --> 13:41.229
You haven't delivered on that.

13:41.231 --> 13:42.831
Well, at least
we're doing something about it.

13:42.833 --> 13:44.699
I don't see you offering up
any solutions.

13:44.701 --> 13:46.935
I'm getting there,
trust me, kid.

13:49.605 --> 13:50.939
There's a common thread

13:50.941 --> 13:53.008
to how these fugitive abnormals

13:53.010 --> 13:55.444
continue to evade
our retrieval teams,

13:55.446 --> 13:57.612
and their ability to infiltrate
the concealed bases.

13:57.614 --> 13:58.780
Does it explain
what went wrong

13:58.782 --> 13:59.815
in Jakarta last week?

14:01.317 --> 14:02.651
The reason these fugitives

14:02.653 --> 14:04.219
have been able to stay
a step ahead

14:04.221 --> 14:06.856
is the same thing that makes
their army so formidable.

14:08.258 --> 14:09.992
There's a hidden leader
among them,

14:09.994 --> 14:12.862
someone with the ability
to communicate instantly

14:12.864 --> 14:14.330
over any distance,

14:14.332 --> 14:15.865
psychically.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.668
And yet you kept
this information to yourself.

14:19.670 --> 14:21.837
Until I had confirmation.

14:21.839 --> 14:23.906
I've had
Kate Freelander

14:23.908 --> 14:25.741
looking into things
down in Hollow Earth,

14:25.743 --> 14:27.843
and a network of informants
here on the surface.

14:27.845 --> 14:29.412
Which is why
we were in Jakarta

14:29.414 --> 14:30.880
in the first place.

14:30.882 --> 14:33.349
We knew the Crixorum
could pass for human.

14:33.351 --> 14:34.884
The only other solid lead we had

14:34.886 --> 14:37.420
was that he needs a daily dose
of vibrio phosphorae bacteria

14:37.422 --> 14:38.655
to survive.

14:38.657 --> 14:40.590
Found in high
concentration

14:40.592 --> 14:42.525
in the local lanternfish.

14:42.527 --> 14:44.326
We were put
in touch with a local

14:44.328 --> 14:46.729
who then led us to the man
who'd been buying them up.

14:53.971 --> 14:55.739
There he is.

15:00.911 --> 15:01.911
Wahid?

15:01.913 --> 15:04.313
<i>Senang bertemu nada.</i>

15:04.315 --> 15:05.314
And to you.

15:05.316 --> 15:06.749
You know about
this man we seek?

15:06.751 --> 15:09.485
There are not many secrets
in the marketplace.

15:09.487 --> 15:11.554
Not to those
who can afford to pay.

15:19.860 --> 15:21.226
The man we seek
needs a special diet.

15:21.228 --> 15:23.895
The man you're looking for
will be here soon.

15:23.897 --> 15:24.829
And you're certain

15:24.831 --> 15:26.030
you've seen this man
here before?

15:26.032 --> 15:27.631
Every evening

15:27.633 --> 15:28.831
he buys from
the fish-seller Samar.

15:28.833 --> 15:30.065
Lantern fish, you're positive?

15:30.067 --> 15:32.668
This type of fish
is not good to eat.

15:35.071 --> 15:36.371
He's your man.

15:36.373 --> 15:38.106
You probably want
to get out of here

15:38.108 --> 15:39.474
before things go down.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.376
We used music

15:42.378 --> 15:44.646
to interfere with
the Crixorum's ability

15:44.648 --> 15:47.548
to manipulate our minds.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.607
Bloody hell.

16:15.609 --> 16:17.176
Who are those guys?

16:17.178 --> 16:19.812
Somebody else was
trying to bag the same prize.

16:19.814 --> 16:21.380
Black market traffickers,
we think.

16:21.382 --> 16:23.082
Whoever they were,

16:23.084 --> 16:24.416
they should have been
more prepared.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.651
They had
state-of-the-art body armor,

16:25.653 --> 16:27.753
automatic weapons,

16:27.755 --> 16:29.054
and no idea
what they were doing.

16:33.962 --> 16:35.595
What is this, a competition?

16:37.097 --> 16:38.798
They're shooting at each other!

16:44.738 --> 16:46.439
Magnus,
we're losing him!

16:46.441 --> 16:47.473
They went in there
totally unprepared,

16:47.475 --> 16:48.908
and got shredded.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.978
So your target,
the Crixorum,

16:52.980 --> 16:54.513
used his mental powers

16:54.515 --> 16:56.481
and turned that place
into a free-fire zone.

16:57.983 --> 17:00.085
Not something
anyone could have predicted.

17:02.557 --> 17:04.890
There's a reason just
the two of us went in there

17:04.892 --> 17:07.593
and we left the rest
of our team out of range.

17:07.595 --> 17:09.863
Because we did have an idea
what we were up against.

17:09.865 --> 17:11.765
Whoever sent
that other team in

17:11.767 --> 17:12.898
is the one
who should be on trial.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.067
Will...

17:14.069 --> 17:15.803
No, no, I'm
tired of this game.

17:15.805 --> 17:19.106
Those were your men,
weren't they, Addison?

17:21.608 --> 17:24.545
You sent those men
to their deaths,

17:24.547 --> 17:25.479
not us.

17:26.714 --> 17:28.182
You're damn right I did.

17:36.901 --> 17:39.469
You must have
really interesting job fairs.

17:39.471 --> 17:41.538
Invitation only.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.774
Whatever, I always figured
government analyst jobs

17:43.776 --> 17:46.177
for a complete snoozefest.

17:46.179 --> 17:48.446
Not if you like
beta-testing cool gear

17:48.448 --> 17:50.415
two years before
people like you

17:50.417 --> 17:52.384
get it on the gray market.

17:52.386 --> 17:54.886
Okay, fine, but tell me
it doesn't suck

17:54.888 --> 17:57.655
having a guy
like Addison for a boss.

17:57.657 --> 17:59.790
I believe in
my work, Henry,

17:59.792 --> 18:00.891
just like you.

18:00.893 --> 18:03.527
Only mine
comes with pension

18:03.529 --> 18:05.262
and health,

18:05.264 --> 18:06.831
a brownstone
in Brooklyn Heights,

18:06.833 --> 18:09.333
and unlimited
first class air travel.

18:09.335 --> 18:10.567
Last month,

18:10.569 --> 18:12.803
I had a working dinner
with Steve Jobs.

18:12.805 --> 18:16.440
Oh, yeah,
I think I heard of him.

18:16.442 --> 18:17.674
Let me know

18:17.676 --> 18:18.942
if you ever decide
to make a change.

18:18.944 --> 18:20.811
There are more than
a few companies

18:20.813 --> 18:22.546
who could use a guy
with your skills.

18:22.548 --> 18:24.214
You know, I doubt that.

18:25.683 --> 18:26.983
So, are you ready
to give me a look

18:26.985 --> 18:29.352
at this custom system
you're so proud of?

18:30.689 --> 18:33.256
You have full access.

18:33.258 --> 18:36.493
Okay, I need complete blueprints
for the following weapons,

18:36.495 --> 18:39.529
a "platinum oscillating
sonic disruptor,"

18:39.531 --> 18:41.364
whatever that is.

18:41.366 --> 18:42.565
Uh-huh.

18:42.567 --> 18:43.766
Something called
"a magna-slinger?"

18:43.768 --> 18:45.168
Yup.

18:45.170 --> 18:48.704
And a handheld invasive
scent directional detector.

18:48.706 --> 18:49.806
The smell-o-vator, check.

18:49.808 --> 18:50.840
And I can't help you.

18:52.443 --> 18:53.810
You do realize

18:53.812 --> 18:55.011
most of these are built
with an hour's lead time

18:55.013 --> 18:56.413
and a deadly abnormal
on the loose.

18:56.415 --> 18:57.581
So no blueprints.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.316
Not even a napkin sketch.

18:59.318 --> 19:01.017
You really want me putting

19:01.019 --> 19:03.820
"jury-rigged weapons
unavailable for inspection--"

19:03.822 --> 19:05.889
Oh, come on,
I never said "jury-rigged."

19:05.891 --> 19:07.857
Yeah, I guess I did.

19:07.859 --> 19:10.727
If you have nothing to hide,
don't hide anything.

19:10.729 --> 19:12.295
Excuse me.

19:13.765 --> 19:16.299
I need 20 minutes.

19:19.572 --> 19:20.938
What happened?
Is she hurt?

19:20.940 --> 19:22.573
Uh...ask her.

19:24.676 --> 19:26.511
Erika?

19:26.513 --> 19:27.512
Don't look!

19:27.514 --> 19:29.347
Sweetheart?

19:29.349 --> 19:30.414
It's okay.

19:30.416 --> 19:31.349
I can't change it.

19:32.751 --> 19:34.385
Magnus can fix this.

19:34.387 --> 19:35.286
You're going to be okay--

19:35.288 --> 19:36.587
I'm out of control.

19:36.589 --> 19:38.489
I can't even think straight!

19:41.993 --> 19:44.427
And th-that...

19:44.429 --> 19:48.398
Is a beautiful part of you.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.632
What would you know about it?

19:53.371 --> 19:54.371
You don't love me.

19:54.373 --> 19:56.941
You don't want me here!

19:56.943 --> 19:58.910
Erika...

19:58.912 --> 19:59.978
Get away from me!

20:08.389 --> 20:09.656
You ignored
Sanctuary jurisdiction

20:09.658 --> 20:10.857
over fugitive abnormals

20:10.859 --> 20:12.992
and put your own people
on the ground.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.060
After the mess you made
in the camp

20:14.062 --> 20:15.662
and the failed retrievals since,

20:15.664 --> 20:16.997
you really find it shocking
we have a plan B?

20:16.999 --> 20:18.031
You had no idea

20:18.033 --> 20:19.599
what you were doing.

20:19.601 --> 20:21.701
You blew all our groundwork
by storming in there unprepared.

20:21.703 --> 20:24.403
Hey, pal,
I lost good men in there.

20:24.405 --> 20:25.938
Anybody in that market
could have been killed

20:25.940 --> 20:27.106
in the crossfire!

20:27.108 --> 20:29.074
Not that you care about
little details

20:29.076 --> 20:30.342
like collateral damage.

20:30.344 --> 20:32.344
You do realize
the value of that creature.

20:32.346 --> 20:35.014
How powerful he could make
whoever controls him?

20:35.016 --> 20:37.483
An abnormal
who can see far-off events

20:37.485 --> 20:41.121
and then relay commands
instantly across any distance?

20:42.423 --> 20:43.791
No way

20:43.793 --> 20:45.660
I was leaving that retrieval
to your side.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.862
Our side?

20:47.864 --> 20:49.764
I see.

20:49.766 --> 20:51.599
If you wanted
safe extraction,

20:51.601 --> 20:54.535
you could have come to us
for a joint mission,

20:54.537 --> 20:55.670
but you didn't.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.838
Of course not.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.741
They wanted to collect
the Crixorum for themselves,

20:59.743 --> 21:01.109
and control it.

21:01.111 --> 21:03.377
How'd you even
find out where it was?

21:03.379 --> 21:05.613
They didn't have to.

21:05.615 --> 21:07.815
You tracked us.

21:13.388 --> 21:14.421
Magnus, we're
losing him!

21:14.423 --> 21:15.656
Stay with him!

21:23.464 --> 21:24.831
He was dead
before he hit the water.

21:24.833 --> 21:27.401
But I suspect
that's what you wanted.

21:27.403 --> 21:29.069
Better to have him
taken out of play

21:29.071 --> 21:31.905
than to fall into
the wrong side.

21:31.907 --> 21:33.707
You both finished?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.709
Unless there's more.

21:35.711 --> 21:39.713
There's just
one small flaw

21:39.715 --> 21:40.881
in the whole narrative.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.755
A little slide show
of the body

21:47.757 --> 21:49.590
my people fished
out of the canal

21:49.592 --> 21:51.425
in Jakarta.

21:51.427 --> 21:53.527
That thing
that we were all chasing?

21:53.529 --> 21:55.896
Autopsy revealed

21:55.898 --> 21:58.499
no extraordinary
brain functions.

21:58.501 --> 22:00.534
Meaning it was no Crixorum.

22:02.170 --> 22:04.805
So, now, how about
we cut the crap,

22:04.807 --> 22:07.508
and you two start
telling me the truth?

22:14.421 --> 22:15.387
I'm not seeing her

22:15.389 --> 22:16.455
on any of our
security feeds.

22:16.457 --> 22:18.224
I cannot believe
you let this happen.

22:18.226 --> 22:19.391
You left her alone.

22:19.393 --> 22:20.526
I have work to do.

22:20.528 --> 22:21.560
You were supposed to be
watching her!

22:21.562 --> 22:23.797
I'm not a jailer.

22:23.799 --> 22:25.332
Erika!

22:25.334 --> 22:26.700
Erika, sweetie?

22:26.702 --> 22:29.236
She definitely
came through here.

22:29.238 --> 22:30.805
Huh?

22:30.807 --> 22:32.340
How do you--?

22:32.342 --> 22:33.307
No.

22:33.309 --> 22:35.577
Oh, no.

22:35.579 --> 22:38.446
No, no, no, you do not sniff
another guy's girlfriend.

22:38.448 --> 22:40.682
I was just trying to help.

22:40.684 --> 22:42.084
Don't help, okay?
I got this.

22:42.086 --> 22:44.786
Fine, I'll be in the lab.

22:58.571 --> 23:00.370
Oh, thank God.

23:08.681 --> 23:09.514
Hey.

23:09.516 --> 23:11.415
Are you okay?

23:11.417 --> 23:12.583
I'm great.

23:13.752 --> 23:15.686
Oh, that's great.

23:15.688 --> 23:18.322
So, uh, you ready
to come back up to iso, then?

23:18.324 --> 23:21.258
Uh, I could,

23:21.260 --> 23:23.560
but while I have you alone,
I wanted to show you something.

23:26.365 --> 23:28.866
See, I had this idea
for an algorithm

23:28.868 --> 23:30.601
that could track
coding errors and your fixes.

23:30.603 --> 23:32.669
Eventually it could
predict your behavior

23:32.671 --> 23:34.504
and fix itself,

23:34.506 --> 23:36.773
even when you're busy
elsewhere.

23:36.775 --> 23:38.607
You did this for me?

23:38.609 --> 23:40.610
Well, it's kind of
for me.

23:40.612 --> 23:41.677
Because it means

23:41.679 --> 23:43.713
you could spend
less time at the keyboard.

23:46.616 --> 23:49.552
Wow.

23:49.554 --> 23:51.820
This is some
great stuff.

23:51.822 --> 23:53.688
Just a few preliminary ideas.

23:53.690 --> 23:56.424
You'll need to refine it.

23:57.626 --> 24:00.461
Liking the foreplay?

24:00.463 --> 24:01.728
Heck, yes.

24:01.730 --> 24:03.296
You know what,
a few revisions,

24:03.298 --> 24:05.798
we could start
testing this right now.

24:05.800 --> 24:09.334
Or... maybe not
right now.

24:13.573 --> 24:16.207
Um... maybe my room
would be better...

24:16.209 --> 24:18.643
Henry, right now.

24:20.747 --> 24:25.318
I know it's the hormones,
but I'm so into this...

24:32.160 --> 24:33.427
Henry.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.632
Separate interviews?

24:37.634 --> 24:39.567
So now we're being treated
as hostile witnesses.

24:39.569 --> 24:41.402
If you start
telling me the truth,

24:41.404 --> 24:42.937
then you won't need to worry

24:42.939 --> 24:44.772
about coordinating your story
with the boy wonder, will you?

24:44.774 --> 24:46.774
Everything
we told you was true.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.542
We identified the man

24:48.544 --> 24:51.478
who believed to be the leader
of the local insurgent cell.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.879
We pursued him.

24:52.881 --> 24:54.347
Your men intervened.

24:54.349 --> 24:55.748
We saw him die.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.450
You're claiming
you believed this man

24:57.452 --> 24:58.918
to be the Crixorum.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.354
I believe the autopsy
your people did was wrong.

25:01.356 --> 25:03.757
How can they be certain

25:03.759 --> 25:05.493
that that dead abnormal
wasn't a Crixorum?

25:05.495 --> 25:07.028
Oh wait,

25:07.030 --> 25:10.732
because they've been doing this
for 120 years like I have.

25:10.734 --> 25:12.334
You reported
Big Bertha was dead

25:12.336 --> 25:13.769
to keep her from being hunted.

25:15.738 --> 25:16.905
I think you're doing
the same thing now.

25:18.507 --> 25:20.442
Could you blame me if I was?

25:22.411 --> 25:23.811
Doctor...

25:25.247 --> 25:27.815
Your high-level allies
are not taking your calls.

25:27.817 --> 25:30.951
I've got people
standing by

25:30.953 --> 25:34.220
waiting to cut off your funding,
freeze your assets,

25:34.222 --> 25:35.822
empty your accounts...

25:35.824 --> 25:37.657
If the case warrants it.

25:37.659 --> 25:39.626
In your judgment.

25:39.628 --> 25:41.362
That's right.

25:41.364 --> 25:42.730
I'm the man

25:42.732 --> 25:44.865
who can bankrupt your Sanctuary
with a phone call.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.707
Where's the real Crixorum?

25:58.983 --> 25:59.915
Bloody hell.

25:59.917 --> 26:01.250
Who are those guys?

26:08.626 --> 26:11.028
They're shooting at each other!

26:12.630 --> 26:14.332
Magnus,
we're losing him!

26:16.635 --> 26:17.768
It's Wahid!
He's doing this!

26:17.770 --> 26:19.604
Wahid
set up the whole thing

26:19.606 --> 26:21.906
to misdirect us.

26:21.908 --> 26:23.408
Yes, we should have read
the playbook on this one,

26:23.410 --> 26:25.644
but things happened too fast.

26:25.646 --> 26:28.013
He created a decoy
to take the heat off of him,

26:28.015 --> 26:29.781
to lay the trail
to the fish market,

26:29.783 --> 26:30.982
all of that.

26:30.984 --> 26:32.618
While your men
were searching the canal...

26:32.620 --> 26:36.287
He headed for the street.

26:36.289 --> 26:37.422
Wahid put the decoy in our path

26:37.424 --> 26:39.957
fully intending
for him to get killed.

26:39.959 --> 26:41.592
He wanted us to think
he was dead.

26:41.594 --> 26:43.460
Why isn't this
what's in your report?

26:43.462 --> 26:45.929
Because a Crixorum can
change the balance of power

26:45.931 --> 26:47.464
for the whole world...

26:47.466 --> 26:49.733
Telling the U.N.,
"gee, guys, sorry,

26:49.735 --> 26:51.200
but he had us fooled"

26:51.202 --> 26:53.302
wouldn't have exactly inspired
confidence, now, would it?

26:53.304 --> 26:55.638
We were hoping
to find him again...

26:55.640 --> 26:57.006
Before anyone else did.

26:59.176 --> 27:00.476
So you made sure

27:00.478 --> 27:02.512
no one else
would be looking for him.

27:02.514 --> 27:04.881
Then you could look like heroes
when you brought him in.

27:04.883 --> 27:05.949
Heroes?

27:05.951 --> 27:08.519
You have no idea how we work.

27:08.521 --> 27:10.688
But I'm right
about what happened?

27:10.690 --> 27:13.725
Public enemy number one
got the better of you.

27:13.727 --> 27:15.394
You lost him.

27:18.532 --> 27:20.098
Well done.

27:24.103 --> 27:26.638
Okay, you guys have
all the reports on these.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.640
I kind of got to
get back downstairs.

27:28.642 --> 27:29.908
Last I recall,

27:29.910 --> 27:32.944
Dr. Magnus
put you at my disposal.

27:32.946 --> 27:35.646
You might want to look up
what that means.

27:35.648 --> 27:39.550
So, these stunners have
a sonic oscillator.

27:39.552 --> 27:41.118
Is that a wide or narrow beam?

27:41.120 --> 27:42.920
Adjustable.

27:42.922 --> 27:45.022
And what's the power
supply on this one?

27:45.024 --> 27:46.891
You'll have to ask
Nikola Tesla, he built it.

27:46.893 --> 27:49.593
Could you please
take this seriously?

27:50.895 --> 27:52.096
Oh.

27:52.098 --> 27:54.098
You are serious.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.100
You people really don't
get this place, do you?

27:56.102 --> 27:57.668
You're trying to do
a red-tape audit

27:57.670 --> 27:59.971
on a place where the guy
who invented alternating current

27:59.973 --> 28:01.539
blows in
on his way through town.

28:01.541 --> 28:03.108
Okay, well, we still
need documentation.

28:03.110 --> 28:05.711
Could you get him to draw up
some patent diagrams?

28:05.713 --> 28:07.113
Uh-huh, yeah.
I'll get right on that.

28:07.115 --> 28:08.014
Great.

28:08.016 --> 28:09.482
Thanks.

28:12.854 --> 28:14.788
I know they
asked you to babysit me.

28:14.790 --> 28:16.423
Again.

28:16.425 --> 28:19.526
Sorry.

28:19.528 --> 28:21.762
So, you and Henry have
been friends a long time.

28:21.764 --> 28:22.996
Can't talk about it.

28:22.998 --> 28:25.031
What? I wasn't--

28:25.033 --> 28:27.434
Going to ask me
about Henry? No?

28:27.436 --> 28:30.036
Childhood? Other women?
Not curious?

28:30.038 --> 28:31.970
Well, of course
I'm curious.

28:31.972 --> 28:34.706
Can't talk about it.
Ask him.

28:34.708 --> 28:37.076
I got that.

28:37.078 --> 28:39.145
So...

28:39.147 --> 28:40.413
What <i> should</i> I ask
him?

28:41.716 --> 28:43.416
Nice try.

28:46.588 --> 28:48.688
Oh...

28:48.690 --> 28:50.157
Good lord.

28:52.427 --> 28:54.161
Something wrong?

28:54.163 --> 28:56.630
Henry needs to
see this, right now.

28:56.632 --> 28:58.799
Hugely dangerous
abnormal on the loose,

28:58.801 --> 29:02.603
which you lied about
to cover up your screw-up.

29:02.605 --> 29:04.104
That's supposed to convince us
to trust Magnus

29:04.106 --> 29:05.138
with the fate of the world?

29:05.140 --> 29:06.673
If you'd trusted her
in the first place,

29:06.675 --> 29:08.207
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

29:08.209 --> 29:11.110
Wow.

29:11.112 --> 29:13.579
You really are
completely under her spell.

29:14.948 --> 29:16.548
You got what you wanted.

29:16.550 --> 29:18.784
We screwed up,
we lost the target,

29:18.786 --> 29:21.687
and you can spin that
however you like.

29:21.689 --> 29:23.021
Are we finished talking?

29:23.023 --> 29:25.024
Not quite.

29:31.031 --> 29:33.033
Now, my job's
not to pull you over

29:33.035 --> 29:34.568
for one moving violation.

29:36.104 --> 29:37.571
I'm here to get
the whole picture

29:37.573 --> 29:39.972
on how this place really runs.

29:41.842 --> 29:42.975
You have a couple of years?

29:45.878 --> 29:48.079
If that's
what it takes.

29:49.648 --> 29:52.983
You know, I get why Helen Magnus
wants to protect her monopoly

29:52.985 --> 29:54.150
on abnormal science.

29:54.152 --> 29:55.752
I do.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.220
It's been
a good living for her

29:57.222 --> 29:58.621
since Britannia
ruled the waves,

29:58.623 --> 30:01.257
and most likely
she'll still be doing it

30:01.259 --> 30:03.026
a hundred years from now.

30:03.028 --> 30:04.394
What does she care

30:04.396 --> 30:06.362
which governments
rise and fall?

30:06.364 --> 30:07.197
But you...

30:09.033 --> 30:11.601
Shouldn't your loyalty
be to your own kind?

30:15.973 --> 30:17.440
And which kind is that?

30:17.442 --> 30:21.043
You were the perfect choice
for her, you know?

30:21.045 --> 30:22.078
Father hardly around,

30:22.080 --> 30:23.546
never had
much in common

30:23.548 --> 30:24.913
with his egghead
son anyway--

30:24.915 --> 30:26.181
Stop trying to profile me.

30:26.183 --> 30:27.849
And then
his indictment,

30:27.851 --> 30:29.951
just as you were starting
to fit in at the Bureau.

30:29.953 --> 30:32.787
Boy, that must have
been tough on you, huh?

30:32.789 --> 30:34.956
Really?

30:34.958 --> 30:36.157
You're really going to go there?

30:36.159 --> 30:38.259
Nothing's off limits
here, Sport.

30:38.261 --> 30:40.061
The people
that you're up against,

30:40.063 --> 30:41.964
starting to feel
how powerful they are yet?

30:43.300 --> 30:45.668
Okay, so you read
my sealed file,

30:45.670 --> 30:48.103
and you know
that I don't shut up

30:48.105 --> 30:49.238
even when people want me to.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.639
Shame about your mother.

30:51.875 --> 30:54.610
Losing her when
you were just a kid?

30:54.612 --> 30:56.011
But then again,

30:56.013 --> 30:57.179
I guess you found the perfect
substitute here, huh?

31:00.751 --> 31:02.618
Tailor-made.

31:13.835 --> 31:15.188
So while Cassidy
was distracting me

31:15.189 --> 31:16.389
with our missing
blueprints,

31:16.391 --> 31:17.491
her people are tunneling
through our firewalls.

31:17.493 --> 31:20.193
If Erika hadn't been testing
her repair gremlin

31:20.195 --> 31:21.428
at that exact right moment,

31:21.430 --> 31:22.963
they might have actually
gotten somewhere.

31:22.965 --> 31:25.332
Any details on what
they were trying to access?

31:25.334 --> 31:27.301
Patient records.
Resident inventory.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.403
The microfilm database

31:29.405 --> 31:30.538
of your father's
journals.

31:30.540 --> 31:31.806
You know,
call it everything.

31:31.808 --> 31:32.840
You did stop them.

31:32.842 --> 31:34.175
Thanks to a few
failsafes, yeah,

31:34.177 --> 31:35.510
but they got close.

31:35.512 --> 31:37.412
Oh, no harm done.

31:37.414 --> 31:39.347
What?

31:39.349 --> 31:41.582
This is an attack, Doc.

31:41.584 --> 31:44.585
Come on, the audit,
the investigation,

31:44.587 --> 31:46.286
it's all just a smokescreen
to get them inside

31:46.288 --> 31:47.387
so they can get their hands
on your research.

31:47.389 --> 31:48.589
I agree.

31:48.591 --> 31:49.924
Let's pull the plug and
kick 'em out, then.

31:49.926 --> 31:52.460
Not just yet.

32:01.638 --> 32:02.538
Okay, now you're
really pushing it.

32:02.540 --> 32:03.572
I'm not kidding
with you--

32:03.574 --> 32:05.608
Come on, don't
take it so personal.

32:05.610 --> 32:06.909
I needed to get
your measure.

32:07.945 --> 32:09.912
Magnus comes off
like a super hero,

32:09.914 --> 32:11.480
but she's no girl scout.

32:11.482 --> 32:12.848
She's full of secrets.

32:12.850 --> 32:15.250
She'll lie to anybody without
any hint of conscience--

32:15.252 --> 32:16.318
For the right reasons.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.719
Matter of opinion!

32:17.721 --> 32:19.788
But I'll tell you what's
not up for debate--

32:19.790 --> 32:21.623
she is about to
bring this place down.

32:21.625 --> 32:23.758
And what for? Ego?

32:23.760 --> 32:25.827
Control?
Someone needs to check that.

32:27.229 --> 32:30.598
She has principles.
Google it.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
Zimmerman,
you need to be practical.

32:33.804 --> 32:35.404
You can stand around,

32:35.406 --> 32:36.672
you can watch this ship
go down with its Captain,

32:36.674 --> 32:37.673
or you can do
what needs to be done--

32:37.675 --> 32:38.774
Screw you.

32:38.776 --> 32:40.510
You did a good job here
last month.

32:40.512 --> 32:42.945
You impressed
some very important people.

32:44.548 --> 32:46.582
Agree to act as
U.N. liaison for this place,

32:46.584 --> 32:47.950
and I guarantee you

32:47.952 --> 32:50.319
I can get Sanctuary's mandate
restored

32:50.321 --> 32:51.620
under your management,

32:51.622 --> 32:54.690
but first you
got to trust me,

32:54.692 --> 32:55.724
and that means
you stop lying to me

32:55.726 --> 32:57.526
about what happened in Jakarta.

32:59.763 --> 33:01.931
<i>Wahid, that's far enough!</i>

33:04.868 --> 33:06.936
Let us help you.

33:13.445 --> 33:15.279
You came here to capture me.

33:16.849 --> 33:20.051
I came here to draw you out...

33:20.053 --> 33:21.286
So we could talk.

33:23.356 --> 33:26.625
What is your offer, Dr. Magnus?

33:27.861 --> 33:29.395
If you stay on the surface,

33:29.397 --> 33:30.996
they will continue
to hunt you

33:30.998 --> 33:32.931
until you're captured or killed.

33:32.933 --> 33:34.667
A lot of other people

33:34.669 --> 33:36.802
will get hurt
in the meantime.

33:37.970 --> 33:39.938
Let us take you home.

33:42.908 --> 33:47.978
My home is gone.

33:47.980 --> 33:49.980
Your people are
building a new world

33:49.982 --> 33:51.315
beneath the surface.

33:51.317 --> 33:53.683
I can take you to them.

33:53.685 --> 33:55.552
Safely.

34:01.727 --> 34:03.327
You've sent
the Hollow Earth Osama home

34:03.329 --> 34:04.795
to rearm and regroup?

34:04.797 --> 34:07.064
We sent him to safety.

34:07.066 --> 34:08.565
His abilities
are far too broad-reaching

34:08.568 --> 34:11.001
to be safely exploited
by anyone, including you.

34:11.003 --> 34:13.338
You realize
that's a capital crime.

34:13.340 --> 34:14.339
Whoa, wait a minute--

34:14.341 --> 34:15.806
Too late, Will.

34:15.809 --> 34:17.641
You gave him what he needed.

34:17.643 --> 34:20.078
What, do you mean
I told him the truth?

34:21.514 --> 34:22.514
Yes.

34:22.516 --> 34:24.081
Because if we don't
start cooperating,

34:24.083 --> 34:25.117
they're going
to shut us down.

34:25.119 --> 34:26.551
And if you do what they say,

34:26.553 --> 34:28.853
they hand the reins
to the Sanctuary to you.

34:28.855 --> 34:31.656
Which I never
ever wanted, ever!

34:31.658 --> 34:34.058
Time to start
being reasonable, Dr. Magnus.

34:35.527 --> 34:36.962
Your funding,
your bank accounts,

34:36.964 --> 34:37.929
your access,

34:37.931 --> 34:40.465
I control it all.

34:40.467 --> 34:43.400
Now, you can
close your doors tomorrow,

34:43.402 --> 34:45.570
or you can accept the fact
that as of now,

34:45.572 --> 34:47.772
the Sanctuary network
is under total supervision

34:47.774 --> 34:49.373
of the U.N. Security Council.

34:51.844 --> 34:53.145
That's right.

34:53.147 --> 34:55.148
I'm your new boss.

34:59.980 --> 35:01.214
Get out.

35:01.216 --> 35:02.548
Right now.

35:02.550 --> 35:04.750
Take your people with you.
You have 10 minutes.

35:05.785 --> 35:07.052
What the hell are you doing?

35:07.054 --> 35:07.919
Magnus...

35:07.921 --> 35:08.753
You heard me.

35:08.755 --> 35:10.889
Leave my property.

35:10.891 --> 35:14.492
You just signed
the Sanctuary's death warrant.

35:14.494 --> 35:16.193
You sure
that's the right move?

35:16.195 --> 35:17.161
This is what you
wanted, isn't it?

35:17.163 --> 35:18.962
To force this outcome?

35:18.964 --> 35:20.631
I wanted us to work together.

35:20.633 --> 35:22.633
This entire investigation
has been a charade

35:22.635 --> 35:24.601
to gain you access.

35:24.603 --> 35:26.670
You knew I would never
hand over my records,

35:26.672 --> 35:28.638
my residents, my <i> friends</i>,

35:28.640 --> 35:32.776
to whatever abnormal
Guantanamo Bay you're planning.

35:32.778 --> 35:36.779
I'd sooner
burn it to the ground.

35:36.781 --> 35:39.849
I have given five lifetimes
to this work.

35:39.851 --> 35:43.219
I have seen
everyone I love die for it.

35:43.221 --> 35:46.588
Do you really think
you can begin to take that on?

35:49.291 --> 35:50.925
This is insane.

35:52.061 --> 35:53.026
Would you please

35:53.028 --> 35:55.262
talk some sense
into her?

35:56.764 --> 35:58.098
Your research has been
bought and paid for

35:58.100 --> 35:59.132
over the years

35:59.134 --> 36:00.734
by the people I work for.

36:03.205 --> 36:06.107
You turn me away now,

36:06.109 --> 36:08.777
you're out in the cold
for good.

36:10.179 --> 36:12.648
You come near us again,

36:12.650 --> 36:15.084
and I'll arrange for you
to be eaten.

36:23.027 --> 36:24.995
After you.

36:43.116 --> 36:45.851
Wow. Did that
just happen?

36:50.123 --> 36:52.792
I thought it went
rather well, actually.

36:54.160 --> 36:58.630
Wouldn't you agree?

36:58.632 --> 37:01.033
Hell, yeah.

37:02.635 --> 37:05.370
Uh, so, no offense,

37:05.372 --> 37:07.071
but you just told
the world's governments

37:07.073 --> 37:08.873
to take a flying leap.

37:08.875 --> 37:10.941
I have money put in places

37:10.943 --> 37:13.310
that Addison
doesn't even know exist.

37:13.312 --> 37:15.112
And...

37:15.114 --> 37:17.214
There's something else
he doesn't know.

37:23.054 --> 37:25.790
Holy crap, is that
who I think it is?

37:25.792 --> 37:26.624
The Crixorum.

37:26.626 --> 37:28.226
We got him.

37:28.228 --> 37:30.862
Um, what kind of
shielding is this?

37:30.864 --> 37:32.097
Can get in our heads
right now?

37:32.099 --> 37:34.766
Something special
I ordered behind your back.

37:34.768 --> 37:36.802
But we need to
keep him sedated

37:36.804 --> 37:38.170
until we find
a more permanent way

37:38.172 --> 37:40.139
to protect ourselves
from his power.

37:40.141 --> 37:41.840
How did he get here?

37:41.842 --> 37:43.075
He's been here all week.

37:44.744 --> 37:46.245
We knew Addison's men
were on our trail,

37:46.247 --> 37:47.980
and we knew they were going to
make a lot of noise going in.

37:47.982 --> 37:49.815
This was the best chance we had
of getting near him

37:49.817 --> 37:52.351
without, you know,
being <i> heard.</i>

37:52.353 --> 37:53.919
But he was one step ahead of us.

37:53.921 --> 37:56.189
He set up the fake Crixorum
to take the fall for him.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.523
<i>Stay with him!</i>

37:57.525 --> 37:58.590
While we were
figuring it out,

37:58.592 --> 38:01.192
Addison's men interfered,
and...

38:01.194 --> 38:02.827
I offered
to get him home safely

38:02.829 --> 38:03.728
in exchange for
a peaceful guarantee.

38:03.730 --> 38:06.865
<i>Let us help you.</i>

38:06.867 --> 38:08.934
He refused my offer.

38:12.772 --> 38:14.906
So why did you keep it
a secret from us?

38:14.908 --> 38:17.175
So we couldn't blow
the punchline.

38:17.177 --> 38:18.609
We had to do
whatever we could

38:18.611 --> 38:19.878
to minimize
the chances

38:19.880 --> 38:21.212
that Addison would pull
the wrong thread.

38:21.214 --> 38:22.681
So all that stuff
you told him,

38:22.683 --> 38:23.883
was any of it true?

38:23.885 --> 38:24.817
Oh, most of it.

38:24.819 --> 38:26.786
It's easier
to keep a lie straight

38:26.788 --> 38:28.020
when it's close
to the truth.

38:28.022 --> 38:30.156
We had to have
layers to the story,

38:30.158 --> 38:31.290
different scenarios

38:31.292 --> 38:32.458
depending on
when he separated us

38:32.460 --> 38:33.760
and how much he already knew.

38:33.762 --> 38:35.361
A guy like that
is never going to be satisfied

38:35.363 --> 38:37.196
with the first thing
he's been told.

38:37.198 --> 38:38.998
He's always going to assume
he's being played.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.733
The one thing we had
in our favor

38:40.735 --> 38:42.201
was that he also assumed

38:42.203 --> 38:43.402
he was the best player
in the room.

38:43.404 --> 38:44.537
Give him something
to figure out--

38:44.539 --> 38:46.172
Well, in our case,
three things--

38:46.174 --> 38:47.640
And let him think
he's won.

38:47.642 --> 38:49.108
So if he even tries
to look for the Crixorum,

38:49.110 --> 38:50.242
he'll be looking
in Hollow Earth.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.310
Good luck with that.

38:51.312 --> 38:52.912
Huh.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.880
It's vital that
he and his superiors think

38:54.882 --> 38:58.050
that cutting off the Sanctuary
was their idea.

38:58.052 --> 38:59.385
Wait a second,
you <i> wanted</i> that to happen?

38:59.387 --> 39:00.587
It had to.

39:00.589 --> 39:02.755
The Sanctuary
needs its freedom.

39:02.757 --> 39:03.756
This was the best way
to get it.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.425
If we're down,

39:05.427 --> 39:06.459
they're not going to
come after us in full force,

39:06.461 --> 39:07.860
at least not for a while.

39:07.862 --> 39:10.063
Now, Addison was right
about one thing.

39:10.065 --> 39:13.500
The Crixorum is a vital
piece of the puzzle.

39:13.502 --> 39:16.202
Quite possibly,
he's the key to it all.

39:16.204 --> 39:19.372
I want that leverage right here.

39:19.374 --> 39:21.942
We're going to need to fortify
our defenses, aren't we?

39:21.944 --> 39:24.277
Very much so, my friend.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.755
I'm afraid the catalyst
for the problems

39:33.757 --> 39:35.289
is the pregnancy.

39:35.291 --> 39:37.491
Your body's producing
defensive enzymes,

39:37.493 --> 39:39.293
likely as a result of
the suppressive hormones

39:39.295 --> 39:41.295
you were taking
for so long.

39:41.297 --> 39:44.898
So, what does that
mean...for us?

39:44.900 --> 39:46.867
There is a procedure
I can offer

39:46.869 --> 39:48.869
that will slow
the embryo's growth.

39:48.871 --> 39:50.804
I believe your body
will be able to tolerate

39:50.806 --> 39:52.005
the pregnancy hormones

39:52.007 --> 39:53.273
at a slower release rate.

39:54.542 --> 39:56.310
And...the-the baby?

39:57.378 --> 39:58.378
It's not without risk,

39:58.380 --> 40:01.949
but if things go
as I expect,

40:01.951 --> 40:04.284
you'll have a healthy child.

40:04.286 --> 40:06.820
It will just take
a little longer than usual,

40:06.822 --> 40:09.256
if... if that's what you want.

40:16.865 --> 40:17.932
We do.

40:17.934 --> 40:19.967
We want this.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.404
All right, then.

40:23.406 --> 40:24.805
A word?

40:34.949 --> 40:37.017
You've got some big
decisions to make, Henry.

40:37.019 --> 40:39.086
Well, we just made
the biggest one.

40:39.088 --> 40:40.287
She's going to be okay, right?

40:40.289 --> 40:42.989
She'll get
the best possible care.

40:42.991 --> 40:44.490
But, Henry, not here.

40:46.292 --> 40:47.559
The Sanctuary's headed
into uncharted waters.

40:47.561 --> 40:49.227
It's no place for a baby.

40:53.232 --> 40:54.365
I can't just
leave you guys.

40:54.367 --> 40:56.901
You need me.

40:56.903 --> 40:59.504
I support whatever
decision you make.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.474
Fortunately,

41:02.476 --> 41:04.009
you'll have a lot of time
to consider your options.

41:05.211 --> 41:07.246
This procedure should change
Erika's gestation rate

41:07.248 --> 41:09.449
from ten and half months
to possibly 22.

41:09.451 --> 41:12.252
Okay, well,
that's good news.

41:12.254 --> 41:17.024
Wait, she's going to be
like this for two years?

41:18.594 --> 41:20.395
Um...

41:33.073 --> 41:35.041
I know we planned
this outcome,

41:35.043 --> 41:37.876
but it's a big risk.

41:37.878 --> 41:40.913
Are you absolutely sure
that this the right move?

41:40.915 --> 41:45.584
I've had more than a century
to think about it, Will.

41:47.887 --> 41:50.355
When you're forced
onto the sidelines,

41:50.357 --> 41:52.357
you see things
from another perspective.

41:52.359 --> 41:54.492
I made a lot of choices
in my life,

41:54.494 --> 41:56.561
some of them in haste.

41:56.563 --> 41:59.297
This was my chance
to rethink the road I was on,

41:59.299 --> 42:01.367
rethink what the Sanctuary
needs to be.

42:05.171 --> 42:06.672
A hundred years
of planning your next move,

42:06.674 --> 42:08.173
and having to sit on your hands
the whole time?

42:09.508 --> 42:11.109
You couldn't wait to sink
your teeth into Addison,

42:11.111 --> 42:12.477
could you?

42:12.479 --> 42:15.179
He's not the problem.

42:15.181 --> 42:16.581
I've allowed us
to become part of a system

42:16.583 --> 42:19.017
that we can't control.

42:19.019 --> 42:21.386
There are changes coming

42:21.388 --> 42:23.255
that the world
is not ready for.

42:23.257 --> 42:26.357
So from now on,

42:26.359 --> 42:28.059
we make our own rules.
