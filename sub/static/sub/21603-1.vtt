WEBVTT

00:25.626 --> 00:29.162
<i>They come in the night.</i>
<i>Always at night.</i>

00:29.663 --> 00:31.164
You don't hear them coming.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.166
They break up families.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.301
You hear stories.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.138
They kill fathers
in front of mothers.

00:38.705 --> 00:43.276
They kill children, old people,
sick people, large people.

00:44.511 --> 00:45.579
They dig graves.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.314
People who are alive,
they throw in them.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.784
You can't hide.

00:52.285 --> 00:53.820
They put a gun to my head.

00:54.821 --> 00:57.524
They took my family.
They burned my village.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.227
They didn't take me.

01:02.462 --> 01:03.597
I don't know why.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.732
(ominous chanting)

01:09.302 --> 01:10.537
(chanting pauses)

01:12.573 --> 01:14.307
(woman on TV continues)
My family, they are gone.

01:16.176 --> 01:17.811
(chanting restarts)

01:20.614 --> 01:21.715
(chanting pauses)

01:22.849 --> 01:23.917
(woman on TV continues)
I don't know if they are alive.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.451
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I will see them again.</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:29.556
(chanting restarts
with sudden pauses)

01:35.495 --> 01:36.863
(woman on TV continues)
Sometimes,

01:36.897 --> 01:38.732
I don't want to be alive.

01:48.775 --> 01:52.245
(orchestra music,
choir chanting restarts)

02:54.708 --> 02:56.342
(groaning)

02:59.980 --> 03:01.314
Ow.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.249
(grunts)

03:03.283 --> 03:05.552
‐ Isaac: You want tea?
‐ No.

03:12.425 --> 03:13.660
(groans)

03:13.827 --> 03:15.195
What are you doing?

03:15.662 --> 03:17.664
Isaac: I just need a minute.
Two minutes.

03:18.665 --> 03:19.966
Ramona: I have to go
to the bathroom.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.267
‐ Isaac: Please.
‐ Stop!

03:21.301 --> 03:22.703
‐ I can't!
‐ Isaac!

03:32.846 --> 03:34.848
(sighs)

03:41.688 --> 03:42.723
(sniffing)

03:43.356 --> 03:47.260
‐ (choir chanting)
‐ (knife scraping)

04:09.049 --> 04:10.717
Isaac: What are you reading?

04:11.785 --> 04:14.721
Ramona: It's about a couple.
A man and a woman.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.491
The man in the couple
is passive.

04:19.793 --> 04:20.927
Directionless.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.797
He's dead,
but he doesn't know it.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.067
‐ The woman‐‐
‐ You've been out of town a lot.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.003
I've been going through a lot,
I've been feeling really bad.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.773
I've been holding back,
but I'm not good right now‐‐

04:32.806 --> 04:35.341
You know,
this actually is about me.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.843
It's about how I feel,
so don't make it

04:36.877 --> 04:39.946
about what you're going
through and where you're at!

04:43.584 --> 04:44.785
(Ramona scoffs)

04:44.818 --> 04:47.320
Tomorrow, I'm going to New York
for ten days.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.690
‐ Isaac: What's in New York?
‐ Ugh!

04:49.956 --> 04:52.759
Nina, I hated you, cursed you,

04:53.393 --> 04:54.995
tore up your letters
and photographs,

04:55.028 --> 04:58.398
and yet I have known
every minute of my life

04:58.431 --> 05:00.901
that my heart and soul
belong to you.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.538
To stop loving you
is beyond my power!

05:05.706 --> 05:07.941
I have suffered
from the time I lost you.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.777
My life has been
almost unendurable.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.445
My youth gone!

05:13.479 --> 05:14.915
I have called out your name,

05:14.948 --> 05:17.450
I have kissed the
ground you walked on.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.586
Wherever I looked
I've seen your face,

05:19.620 --> 05:22.055
and that smile that
shined down on me

05:22.422 --> 05:23.924
in the best years of my life.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.560
Why does he talk
to me like this?

05:27.994 --> 05:29.462
I'm so lonely.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.066
I don't feel close to anyone.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.068
I'm so cold.

05:35.101 --> 05:39.105
Everything I write is dry
and gloomy and harsh!

05:40.641 --> 05:44.811
Stay Nina, I beg you,
or at least let me go with you!

05:47.447 --> 05:49.082
My carriage is at the gate.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.586
Don't come to see me off.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.455
I shall find the way alone.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.666
Let me have some water.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.970
Isaac: Hmm, mmm.
Mm‐hmm.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.039
Alex.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.409
Alex, Alex, Alex.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.047
Alex, what can we say to...

06:24.017 --> 06:25.118
Tracy...

06:26.286 --> 06:31.758
to give her a bit of insight
into where she has gone...

06:34.494 --> 06:35.629
off course?

06:38.064 --> 06:40.133
I think you're approaching
this one dimensionally.

06:40.701 --> 06:44.070
It's lacking depth.
It's thin, it's...

06:45.071 --> 06:46.807
hollow, it's false.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.142
It's not ringing.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.147
Our job is a whole.
It's three dimensions.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.719
For example, to be crying
doesn't make you connected.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.756
It's not a choice,
it's a result of a choice.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.725
One would've
to earn the tears.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.428
Plus you weren't really
even looking at me.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.431
Tracy: I wasn't looking at you
because Nina isn't.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.901
She has to get away from you.
I have to get away from you.

07:14.935 --> 07:19.673
‐ I have to‐‐
‐ I... don't believe you. Tracy.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.710
And I have a feeling you
don't believe yourself.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.186
You have the fortune
of being able to work

07:33.219 --> 07:36.957
with a partner
that's giving you gift,

07:37.858 --> 07:38.925
after gift,

07:39.760 --> 07:40.861
after gift.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.597
Stop fucking taking
that for granted.

07:45.231 --> 07:48.001
Can you share with us a little
bit about how you got here?

07:49.269 --> 07:51.772
I've been using
colors in my exploring.

07:52.873 --> 07:56.142
I'll start with a palette and...

07:56.843 --> 07:59.613
score each scene accordingly.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.120
It's given me great insight
into his whole...

08:08.288 --> 08:10.156
metaphysical spectrum.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.058
(soft jazz music plays)

08:12.092 --> 08:14.194
When I was in New York,
I played him in college.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.862
It was the same for me.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.598
Alex: Anyway, they welcomed us
with open arms.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.133
They showed us their rituals,
gave us good things to eat.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.736
Before long, we completely
forgot about Tibet,

08:22.769 --> 08:24.738
and we just wanted
to stay there.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.774
But we didn't because
it was very run down,

08:27.808 --> 08:31.044
there's nothing to do,
it was quite boring. So we left.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.046
Isaac: I'm thinking
of going next year.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.582
‐ Alex: With your lady?
‐ Isaac: No, she hates travel.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.019
‐ She travels a lot for work.
‐ Alex: What's her work?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.886
Isaac: Medical supply.
She works for a company

08:40.921 --> 08:42.722
‐ that makes a machine.
‐ Oh.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.891
It's a blood vacuum.
It helps with sutures,

08:44.925 --> 08:47.528
gets the blood out of the way
for doctors, it's gross.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.996
I don't think it's gross.
I think it's kinda sexy.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.933
‐ Can I?
‐ Of course.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.869
You're very welcome to.

08:55.902 --> 08:58.004
‐ Huh, thank you.
‐ Here you go.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.008
‐ You smoke, Isaac?
‐ All the time.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.615
‐ Want to grab a bite?
‐ Alex: Wish I could,

09:08.649 --> 09:10.183
but I've got
a lot of homework to do.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.785
‐ Isaac: What for?
‐ Alex: I don't know,

09:11.818 --> 09:13.687
it's kind of a big movie.
I'd rather not say

09:13.720 --> 09:14.621
too much right now.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.089
Isaac: Yeah, yeah,
what's the part like?

09:17.357 --> 09:19.092
‐ Alex: I just got the script.
‐ I get it. Is it a big part?

09:19.860 --> 09:22.028
Well, I haven't
read the script yet.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.330
What can I say to you?

09:25.365 --> 09:28.835
Anyway, Isaac, maybe grab
a drink after next class.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.576
I feel like we'll have a lot
to offer each other socially.

09:38.044 --> 09:39.913
‐ What?
‐ I feel like we'll have a lot

09:39.946 --> 09:42.315
‐ to offer each other socially.
‐ Okay, my friend.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.953
I remember this
tree and this sign.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.288
They want you.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.824
What I meant to say,
I think they want you.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.959
I don't want to jump ahead,
but let me tell you something,

09:52.993 --> 09:55.862
‐ they love your look! Love it!
‐ Isaac: (over phone) Good.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.297
Yeah, it's the direction
they want to go.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.532
Isaac: Well, good, good.

09:58.565 --> 10:02.836
Your audition‐‐ rock solid,
rock solid. This will be huge.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.271
‐ Wow.
‐ Guy: This is a game changer.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.273
‐ Billboards.
‐ Well, good.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.376
‐ Guy: Bus stops, magazines.
‐ Good.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.346
Guy: T‐shirts, L. A., New York...

10:13.379 --> 10:15.381
‐ That's‐‐
‐ (laughs) Milwaukee.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.250
‐ That's good.
‐ Guy: You know you've hit it

10:17.851 --> 10:19.653
when you're on a billboard
in Milw‐‐

10:22.288 --> 10:25.258
No. My friends
aren't gonna want just bagels.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.227
They're gonna want a variety.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.731
Look, I just don't want
anything with chocolate.

10:30.764 --> 10:34.267
I mean, do you have burritos?
Okay, how much are those?

10:36.302 --> 10:38.271
How large are they in inches?

10:40.406 --> 10:42.008
Great, I'll take 15 of those.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.344
Do you want to just
come in and say hi?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.346
Because I honestly,
I don't know how much longer

10:46.379 --> 10:48.649
‐ I'm gonna be on.
‐ Isaac: I can't.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.426
No, I don't want any apples
'cause they brown too quickly.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.029
What about berries?
Do you have any berries?

11:03.463 --> 11:07.400
Like strawberries,
blackberries, raspberries?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.903
Right, okay.
So how much for all of that?

11:10.804 --> 11:12.305
A head?
Well, is he there?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.473
I mean you're quoting
me almost double.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.843
Can you please get Javier?
No, he is gonna remember me.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.679
Yes I can hold.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.414
‐ How much?
‐ Three, four.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.293
I dream every night
that you've seen me

11:33.326 --> 11:34.861
and don't recognize me.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.065
I've been wandering about
on the shores of the lake

11:39.099 --> 11:41.201
ever since I came back.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.270
I came close to your
house several times,

11:44.304 --> 11:46.372
but I hadn't the courage
to come in.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.309
Sit with me.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.350
It's so quiet and warm in here.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.454
Do you hear the wind whistling?

12:03.123 --> 12:06.159
Tracy and Isaac: (in unison)
Happy is he who can sit at night

12:06.192 --> 12:08.128
under the roof of his own...

12:12.198 --> 12:13.366
‐ who...
‐ Isaac: Has a warm...

12:13.399 --> 12:14.835
Tracy and Isaac: (in unison)
...warm corner

12:14.868 --> 12:18.138
in which to take refuge.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.040
Isaac: Mm‐hmm.

12:21.041 --> 12:21.908
Hmm.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.479
Tracy, Tracy, Tracy.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.517
Alex, how do we help Tracy?

12:31.017 --> 12:32.252
Alex: It feels like
you're not listening!

12:32.285 --> 12:34.521
Tracy: But I was,
I swear, honest.

12:34.555 --> 12:37.257
There was a wonderful
opportunity for connection

12:37.290 --> 12:40.426
back there
that you just let slip away.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.765
Right when we were about
to uncover the true meat...

12:45.566 --> 12:47.534
of the thing,
you withdrew.

12:48.168 --> 12:51.071
Tracy: I went where the text
led me, where you led me.

12:51.572 --> 12:54.074
‐ I felt terrified to my core.
‐ No.

12:55.509 --> 12:58.779
Do me a favor, and this is
really for everyone except Alex.

13:00.146 --> 13:03.550
Before our next class,
bring in a picture of yourself.

13:03.584 --> 13:05.185
Before you come
through that door,

13:06.319 --> 13:07.788
tear it in pieces.

13:08.288 --> 13:13.026
‐ I‐‐
‐ I, I, I... (snaps)

13:17.531 --> 13:20.333
Alex, it grew even
more this week.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.803
Bravo!
Invite us into your process.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.337
Alex: Well, cheers, thank you.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.207
I've been doing a lot
of animal work.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.442
And not just one animal,
but I find there's...

13:30.410 --> 13:32.979
different animals for
nearly every scene.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.049
I'll go from being
a gorilla to a panther

13:36.082 --> 13:38.084
in a matter of seconds.
(chuckles)

13:38.484 --> 13:41.955
It's just kind
of helped me find...

13:44.090 --> 13:45.225
how erratic...

13:46.960 --> 13:48.962
he is, I am.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.331
He is so erratic.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.333
You are so erratic,
but at times...

13:53.366 --> 13:55.235
‐ (laughs)
‐ ...you aren't erratic at all.

13:58.639 --> 14:01.007
When I was playing Estragon
in New York, in Godot....

14:01.307 --> 14:03.376
‐ We all know Beckett?
‐ Tracy: I know of the piece.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.947
We were off Broadway...

14:07.247 --> 14:09.449
Hey, buddy, you booked it.

14:10.651 --> 14:12.519
You shoot on Monday.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.589
This is good.
This is great!

14:16.089 --> 14:18.024
This is fucking fantastic!

14:18.692 --> 14:21.862
They're excited.
Oh, they're very excited.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.597
They couldn't stop gushing!

14:30.236 --> 14:31.538
Alex: Everything good?

14:33.607 --> 14:35.509
‐ I booked a thing.
‐ Well, what is it?

14:36.510 --> 14:39.112
‐ It's nothing, it's small.
‐ Well, we should celebrate.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.547
You're not the only
one who booked.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.016
You know, that thing
I went out for, I got it.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.985
I didn't think
they were gonna hire me.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.620
I'm going off to Denmark
in a few weeks.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.588
‐ Denmark?
‐ It's so crazy,

14:47.621 --> 14:48.522
they got me a work visa.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.356
It's been so long
since I've been abroad,

14:50.390 --> 14:53.026
‐ nearly a year now.
‐ Is it a big part?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.661
My name's gonna
be on the poster.

14:54.695 --> 14:56.496
Hmm.
How long will you be there?

14:56.530 --> 14:59.132
Six months, eight months,
maybe longer, who knows?

14:59.165 --> 15:01.034
He works fast apparently,
the director.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.036
That's what everybody says,
but we'll see.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.671
I might stay on a bit
and do some traveling

15:04.705 --> 15:06.239
after we wrap, you know?

15:06.272 --> 15:08.141
Maybe link up with some
buddies of mine over there.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.677
I have friends everywhere:
Tunisia, Morocco, Chad.

15:10.711 --> 15:12.412
‐ Chad?
‐ That's all in Africa,

15:12.445 --> 15:15.215
but it's all so close, you know?
It's really just right there.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.084
I mean, it feels a little
farther than it does on a globe,

15:18.284 --> 15:20.587
‐ but I'm still figuring it out.
‐ Wow.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.056
I couldn't have gotten it
without your help.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.359
‐ You wanna grab that drink?
‐ I have to talk on the phone.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.294
‐ I can wait.
‐ Please stop following me!

15:28.328 --> 15:30.196
Excuse me, my car was towed.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.099
‐ Well, you're not‐‐
‐ What?

15:35.301 --> 15:37.470
Simone: (whispering) The beard
makes him look a bit transient,

15:37.671 --> 15:40.440
‐ like a migrant worker.
‐ Client: It feels dirty.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.175
Simone: Oh, I like that.
You don't like that?

15:42.208 --> 15:44.477
‐ My issue is size.
‐ Mmm.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.080
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ It's a lot of face.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.583
It's a bit brutal.
It's kind of heavy, isn't it?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.085
Maybe it's the shirt.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.555
(laughs)

15:56.189 --> 15:58.258
The shirt isn't going
to change the size.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.195
Look, I agree with you.
I mean, it's a lot.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.197
(camera shutter clicking)

16:07.500 --> 16:08.635
Mm‐hmm.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.337
Good, good.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.339
Big smile.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.242
Hold your breath.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.516
Hold your breath.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.519
Exhale!

16:28.221 --> 16:29.355
Gloom, gloomy.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.392
More gloom.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.629
No, no that's not it at all.

16:35.796 --> 16:36.697
No.

16:36.730 --> 16:40.366
Uh, looks goofy now.
A bit more serious.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.369
Uh, a bit more joyful.

16:43.804 --> 16:46.406
Refreshed.
Morning.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.476
No, not mourning, sunshine.

16:51.612 --> 16:54.748
Oh, my God.
Can I get hair and makeup?

16:54.781 --> 16:55.782
Cleo!

16:57.618 --> 16:59.419
Where the hell is that girl?

17:00.253 --> 17:03.156
His face is greasy
and the beard looks shit.

17:14.867 --> 17:19.573
I think you're thinking too much
about how you see your own face,

17:19.806 --> 17:23.276
when you need to be thinking
about what other people see

17:23.443 --> 17:25.546
when they look at your face.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.682
Not what you see
when you see your face.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.720
What we see,
not what you see.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.199
Mm‐hmm.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.469
Looking a bit overwhelmed.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.471
Need to take a break?

17:52.338 --> 17:54.174
Let's take five.
Five!

17:56.677 --> 17:57.744
(sighs)

18:00.681 --> 18:02.248
What kind of fish is that?

18:03.550 --> 18:04.450
Mackerel.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.757
Do you need anything?

18:12.358 --> 18:13.760
You smell like flowers.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.096
Thank you, that's so sweet!

18:17.598 --> 18:19.499
‐ How old is your son?
‐ He's eight.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.636
My sister has a black son.
He's six.

18:24.738 --> 18:26.206
That's wonderful.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.143
I don't usually do
this kind of work.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.113
Oh, what kind of
work do you usually do?

18:35.882 --> 18:38.351
I used to live in New York.
Have you been there?

18:39.620 --> 18:40.854
A few times.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.856
Can I have
your telephone number?

18:43.624 --> 18:46.226
Well, I don't like the eyes,
and you don't like the mouth.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.333
Get off me! Get off me!
Get off me!

18:53.366 --> 18:55.636
Get off me! Get off me!

18:55.669 --> 18:57.203
‐ Get off me!
‐ Hey!

18:57.237 --> 18:59.506
Hey, are you cool?
Is this good?

18:59.540 --> 19:00.674
Are you good?

19:01.441 --> 19:03.544
Uh, I heard screaming.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.482
‐ I knocked.
‐ Isaac: You didn't.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.785
I did.
And you didn't answer

19:11.818 --> 19:14.254
so I got worried,
I got so worried.

19:14.555 --> 19:15.488
It sounded like
you were in trouble

19:15.522 --> 19:17.257
so I wanted to come
here and help you out.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.159
I wanted to make sure
things were good.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.794
I brought my knife.

19:21.962 --> 19:23.296
(door closes)

19:25.932 --> 19:27.333
Hi.

19:27.801 --> 19:29.703
I thought you were
coming back tomorrow.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.806
No, back today.
I left you a message.

19:33.707 --> 19:35.441
I would've picked
you up at the airport.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.278
‐ (laughs) Since when?
‐ I would've done it this time.

19:38.579 --> 19:39.613
‐ Toby?
‐ How come

19:39.646 --> 19:42.583
‐ you're always in black?
‐ I didn't know I was.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.651
Did you do something
with your hair?

19:44.918 --> 19:46.720
‐ A friend brushed it.
‐ Ah.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.224
‐ Isaac: I missed you.
‐ Ramona: Okay.

19:54.928 --> 19:56.597
Isaac: We should get dinner.

19:56.997 --> 19:58.565
Ramona: I have plans.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.301
‐ Isaac: With who?
‐ Ramona: Uh, a friend.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.969
You don't know him.

20:04.004 --> 20:06.507
‐ Toby: Guys, should I go?
‐ You should stay.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.678
Oh, my purse.

20:13.013 --> 20:15.215
‐ Tomorrow night?
‐ Ramona: I'm leaving again.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.719
‐ Where are you going?
‐ Ramona: Dallas and then Miami.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.622
‐ I got a job.
‐ Toby: Oh, what kind of job?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.624
Commercials.
They took pictures.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.826
That's just great.

20:26.627 --> 20:27.861
Don't wait up.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.396
‐ Isaac: I can come with you.
‐ I have a car waiting.

20:31.532 --> 20:32.833
‐ Isaac: I can be ready fast.
‐ It's better you stay.

20:41.508 --> 20:44.477
Do you remember how
pleasant the old times were?

20:46.713 --> 20:52.385
What a gay, bright, gentle,
pure life we led?

20:53.386 --> 20:56.322
How a feeling as
sweet and tender

20:56.356 --> 20:59.359
as a flower blossomed
in our hearts?

21:02.863 --> 21:04.297
Do you remember?

21:05.431 --> 21:06.567
People...

21:07.568 --> 21:10.003
Lions, eagles,

21:10.671 --> 21:13.940
quails, horned deer,

21:14.541 --> 21:17.443
geese, spiders,

21:17.878 --> 21:21.682
silent fish
dwelling in the water,

21:22.082 --> 21:25.051
and all those
invisible to the eye.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.854
A thousand years have passed

21:27.888 --> 21:31.558
since the earth last bore
a living creature to its breast.

21:32.559 --> 21:37.564
And the unhappy moon now
lights her lamp in vain.

21:39.132 --> 21:42.402
No longer do the cranes
awaken the meadows.

21:43.436 --> 21:47.407
No longer do the maybugs
sing in the linden grove.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.781
I hope nobody sees
her in the garden.

21:56.950 --> 21:58.084
Isaac: Hmm.

22:00.120 --> 22:03.323
Mm‐hmmm.
Mmm, mmm.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.994
(Isaac clears throat)

22:10.130 --> 22:12.065
Tracy, what am I going to say?

22:12.866 --> 22:14.100
That I'm bad.

22:16.870 --> 22:18.605
I didn't know you
had this in you.

22:19.506 --> 22:20.874
To be honest,
the only thing that kept me

22:20.907 --> 22:22.442
from kicking you
out of this class

22:22.475 --> 22:24.410
was that you look a lot
like this woman

22:24.444 --> 22:26.479
I wanted to spend my life with.

22:27.748 --> 22:30.584
Milky skin, wavy hair...

22:31.585 --> 22:33.019
New York girl.

22:37.624 --> 22:39.025
Absolutely astounding.

22:39.159 --> 22:42.395
This is the type of work none
of you have come close to.

22:44.765 --> 22:47.133
As you know,
next week is our last class.

22:47.167 --> 22:49.169
We pick back up in eight weeks.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.404
There's a sign up
sheet on my desk.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.660
Alex: How'd I do in there?

23:15.629 --> 23:17.497
(Isaac sighs)

23:21.134 --> 23:22.569
Not your best.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.309
‐ (answering machine beeps)
‐ Ramona: I'm coming back

23:29.342 --> 23:31.778
<i>a day early,</i>
<i>but I'm gone again right away.</i>

23:31.812 --> 23:34.114
Dallas, then Miami, who knows?

23:34.147 --> 23:35.849
Anyways, I would like
to carve out a time

23:35.882 --> 23:37.551
for us to talk when I get back.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.520
I think we could
both use some space.

23:39.686 --> 23:41.187
Okay, I hope you're well.

23:42.188 --> 23:44.658
Man: So, can I take
you somewhere nice or not?

23:44.691 --> 23:46.660
Ramona: I have a really
early start.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.763
Man: You're blushing.
Can I brush your hair?

23:49.796 --> 23:51.064
(answering machine beeps)

23:51.097 --> 23:53.133
Esther: Isaac, it's me,
your mother.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.601
Are you there?

23:55.769 --> 23:57.971
<i>I sent you a text message.</i>
<i>Did you get it?</i>

23:58.605 --> 24:00.974
Roger Lurtzman,
he does our money?

24:01.241 --> 24:02.676
You know Roger.

24:03.844 --> 24:05.546
<i>He says you didn't deposit</i>
<i>the last check.</i>

24:05.846 --> 24:07.080
You still have it?

24:08.414 --> 24:10.684
<i>Let me know, because I can</i>
<i>cancel it if you lost it.</i>

24:11.852 --> 24:14.821
Don't put that there!
I just cleaned that.

24:14.855 --> 24:16.823
‐ You can't see that surface?
‐ Man: Thanks a lot,

24:16.857 --> 24:18.592
‐ that's a big help.
‐ Esther: Oh, God!
(bangs phone)

24:18.759 --> 24:20.627
(Esther continues speaking
indistinctly)

24:21.261 --> 24:23.597
Esther: Call me, I love you.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.065
‐ (answering machine beeps)
‐ Guy: Buddy,

24:25.098 --> 24:27.834
<i>I got you</i>
<i>on this national spot.</i>

24:28.268 --> 24:29.636
I'll send over the pages.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.204
Look it over.
I like it.

24:32.272 --> 24:35.776
It's not exactly your thing,
but they love your look.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.845
They said you're
in their top six. Top six!

24:38.879 --> 24:40.480
(answering machine beeps)

24:46.587 --> 24:48.154
I feel like
I'm getting stronger.

24:48.789 --> 24:50.957
I feel like it's in me.
Is that how you feel?

24:50.991 --> 24:52.793
Is that what you think?

24:53.259 --> 24:55.061
I feel like I finally
know where to go

24:55.095 --> 24:57.964
inside myself
to actually do the work.

24:58.298 --> 25:00.567
I feel present.
I feel like I'm living.

25:00.601 --> 25:03.804
I feel like
the material is using me.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.607
I feel proud of myself.

25:06.807 --> 25:09.843
I feel proud that I had
the courage to go there.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.779
I was on a ledge looking
down and unafraid.

25:13.647 --> 25:15.148
What are you up to tomorrow?

25:16.016 --> 25:17.283
‐ Hi.
‐ Hello.

25:17.317 --> 25:18.919
Want to come over for dinner?

25:20.687 --> 25:23.256
Technically I have something,
but I guess I can move it.

25:23.657 --> 25:24.925
Eight o'clock.

25:25.926 --> 25:27.528
Mmm, okay. Yeah.

25:27.661 --> 25:29.563
Can either of you give me
a lift to the bus stop?

25:29.596 --> 25:30.664
My car was totaled.

25:36.069 --> 25:37.904
Incontinence is not
just a lady problem,

25:37.938 --> 25:39.773
it's an everybody problem.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.642
Twenty‐five million
Americans suffer

25:41.675 --> 25:45.311
from urinary incontinence.
25% of that 25 million are men.

25:45.345 --> 25:48.048
That's five million men
with bladder problems.

25:48.081 --> 25:50.150
(Les coughing)

25:55.822 --> 25:58.625
Nine and a half percent of men
ages 15 to 64

25:58.659 --> 26:00.293
who live at home
have incontinence.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.664
Incontinence is caused
by inflammation of the prostate,

26:03.697 --> 26:06.900
neurological disorders, spinal
injury, diabetes, or stress.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.702
Les: Can you take it
from the top of the end?

26:11.237 --> 26:12.806
With Dignity Diapers,

26:12.839 --> 26:15.308
incontinence is not just
your problem, it's ours.

26:15.709 --> 26:17.377
Briefs feature
a moisture‐proof lining,

26:17.410 --> 26:20.647
wetness indicator, and
super absorbent micro‐beads.

26:20.681 --> 26:22.048
Isaac and Les: (in unison)
Dignity Diapers,

26:22.082 --> 26:24.350
for a fit that stays
in place and helps you

26:24.384 --> 26:27.921
or those you love stay
confident and comfortable.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.190
Great.
How old are you?

26:31.725 --> 26:33.860
‐ Isaac: Thirty‐five
‐ (snickers)

26:34.260 --> 26:35.629
Isaac: Forty.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.999
‐ How much do you weigh?
‐ Isaac: One‐sixty‐five

26:39.399 --> 26:42.736
Les: Mmm, let's say 220
to be safe.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.237
Thank you so much for coming in.

26:45.839 --> 26:47.874
‐ Thank you.
‐ Les: Stay cool out there.

26:49.209 --> 26:50.911
(distant dog barking)

26:51.077 --> 26:55.215
‐ (suspenseful music)
‐ (discordant speaking)

27:02.856 --> 27:05.391
(spray paint can rattling)

27:08.161 --> 27:10.864
(spray paint can hissing)

27:31.317 --> 27:33.186
(spray paint can rattling)

27:46.466 --> 27:50.203
I know. Right. Crazy.
They thought I was him.

27:51.204 --> 27:53.273
And I'm like,
"No way, I'm not him."

27:53.807 --> 27:56.677
Come on, come on, I'm like
three feet taller than him

27:56.977 --> 27:59.045
and I'm in much
better shape, right?

27:59.846 --> 28:01.181
No, I mean he's
in good shape too,

28:01.214 --> 28:02.949
but it's just that
I'm much thinner.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.822
Mom, I gotta call you back.

28:11.224 --> 28:13.193
(keys jingling)

28:18.464 --> 28:20.100
(pounding on door)

28:21.067 --> 28:22.435
Sorry I'm late.

28:22.803 --> 28:24.470
‐ Car trouble?
‐ Something like that.

28:24.505 --> 28:26.339
It was spray painted.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.843
What did it say?

28:30.343 --> 28:32.979
It's really dark.
I'd rather not repeat it.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.981
Who do you think
was behind it?

28:35.015 --> 28:36.449
Most probably some gang.

28:36.482 --> 28:39.786
There's a lot of that
activity in my area right now.

28:39.820 --> 28:41.421
The locals are up in arms
about how much

28:41.454 --> 28:43.824
‐ the neighborhood's changed.
‐ Well, you're lucky

28:43.857 --> 28:45.992
it's just your car.
It could've been your face.

28:46.392 --> 28:49.095
Strawberry cake
from Antonio's on Pico.

28:52.498 --> 28:53.667
‐ Isaac: Do you want a tour?
‐ Please.

28:53.700 --> 28:56.402
‐ <i>Original tile, late 30s.</i>
‐ Alex: <i>Great detail.</i>

28:57.538 --> 28:59.405
I like that sort of a thing
in a place.

29:04.545 --> 29:06.847
‐ Bedroom.
‐ Nice.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.448
Two summers ago,
when I was in Japan, I‐‐

29:08.481 --> 29:10.250
Ramona and I have sex
much more in here

29:10.283 --> 29:12.018
than any other room.

29:22.896 --> 29:25.231
(jazz music playing)

29:47.153 --> 29:50.056
My head hurts.
I'm getting my period.

29:52.025 --> 29:53.326
You just had it.

29:54.027 --> 29:55.562
That's how that works.

30:11.612 --> 30:13.479
‐ Have you ever thrown a knife?
‐ No.

30:13.914 --> 30:15.348
Do you have an ashtray?

30:16.216 --> 30:17.818
Ash on the floor.

30:20.420 --> 30:22.188
When I was little,
I wanted to be in the circus.

30:22.222 --> 30:24.324
I thought it would be cool
to be a knife thrower

30:24.357 --> 30:25.826
in an old carnival.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.429
That life is not as
romantic as it seems.

30:29.930 --> 30:32.298
In Barcelona, I met
this old circus couple.

30:32.332 --> 30:34.100
They were incredible.

30:34.367 --> 30:36.503
Their living conditions
were just horrid.

30:36.970 --> 30:40.073
Cramped. Damp. Unsanitary.

30:40.106 --> 30:41.608
They had no money.

30:41.975 --> 30:47.247
Yeah, but I'd be throwing knives
and just be spot on like, uh.

30:48.481 --> 30:49.482
Uh.

30:50.684 --> 30:51.985
Uh.

30:53.086 --> 30:54.988
‐ Uh.
‐ Do you mind not doing that?

31:00.226 --> 31:01.461
And the only thing
you can actually eat there

31:01.494 --> 31:04.965
is the ceviche which they catch
and they make fresh every day.

31:04.998 --> 31:06.366
The older brother would
go out on the boat,

31:06.399 --> 31:08.334
and we would watch
him from the beach.

31:08.368 --> 31:10.370
And then the younger brother
would make the ceviche

31:10.403 --> 31:11.505
and we would have that
essentially‐‐

31:11.538 --> 31:14.140
The next scene you do in class
should be some Simon.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.544
I don't know if I'm going
to be coming back to class.

31:18.011 --> 31:19.646
After the movie, and traveling,

31:19.680 --> 31:22.248
I'm thinking of taking up
some writing.

31:22.549 --> 31:24.384
I have a couple of ideas
I want to flesh out.

31:24.417 --> 31:26.186
One is about a sailor at sea.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.421
Right now, I'm open
to stage or screen.

31:32.693 --> 31:35.295
(loud groan)

31:40.033 --> 31:42.002
I was such a good person to you.

31:42.435 --> 31:44.571
You've been great to me
and I've been great to you.

31:46.306 --> 31:47.440
No.

31:48.441 --> 31:50.276
I had a promising career
back in New York.

31:50.310 --> 31:51.678
People would stop me
on the street.

31:51.712 --> 31:53.279
They recognized me.

31:54.014 --> 31:56.216
‐ I didn't know that.
‐ You used me.

31:56.650 --> 31:58.952
I didn't use you.
I've never used anybody.

31:59.152 --> 32:00.921
You're my friend, we're friends.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.056
I'm in your corner
and you're in mine.

32:03.223 --> 32:05.926
(chair scraping loudly)

32:14.467 --> 32:16.069
How are you?

32:17.203 --> 32:18.939
‐ No.
‐ (pounds loudly)

32:20.473 --> 32:22.308
You're making me
a little worried.

32:23.409 --> 32:24.444
I know.

32:41.227 --> 32:42.428
(Isaac sighs)

32:44.631 --> 32:46.066
(Alex grunts)

33:06.520 --> 33:09.022
‐ I think I'm gonna head out.
‐ I should've poisoned you.

33:09.523 --> 33:12.225
I knew you were crazy.
I thought it was good crazy.

33:12.526 --> 33:14.661
I liked it. I liked it a lot.
I thought it was fun.

33:15.095 --> 33:17.998
Now, I know you're bad crazy.
You're unstable!

33:18.231 --> 33:19.800
You should talk to someone
about where you're at.

33:19.833 --> 33:21.101
(food squelching)

33:50.396 --> 33:51.565
I?

33:54.568 --> 33:56.036
Isaac?

34:00.406 --> 34:02.408
‐ Ugh, you're wet.
‐ (phone ringing)

34:02.442 --> 34:04.277
Isaac: I went for a run.

34:05.345 --> 34:06.580
(scoffs)

34:10.216 --> 34:11.784
Was somebody here?

34:12.819 --> 34:14.554
I don't have friends.

34:17.190 --> 34:19.324
‐ You gonna answer that?
‐ (answering machine beeps)

34:19.359 --> 34:21.226
Alex: (recording) I don't know
what the fuck just happened.

34:21.261 --> 34:22.829
I mean, what was that?
What just happened?

34:22.862 --> 34:24.496
I should call the cops.
I should tell them

34:24.531 --> 34:26.132
‐ what you just did...
‐ Leave it.

34:26.166 --> 34:27.467
Alex: ...fucking asshole.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.435
<i>I have your fingerprints</i>
<i>all over my face and throat.</i>

34:29.469 --> 34:30.737
You better stay away from me!

34:30.771 --> 34:33.507
<i>If I see you anywhere near me,</i>
<i>I'm calling the cops.</i>

34:33.540 --> 34:34.741
(answering machine beeps)

34:34.775 --> 34:37.443
You never thought about being
with another woman. Really?

34:37.476 --> 34:39.411
If you want to break up,
you should say it.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.848
It's not gonna hurt less
because you can't say it.

34:42.215 --> 34:44.585
I think you would like
seeing someone else.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.088
You're trying to get out of this
without having to face me.

34:48.889 --> 34:51.824
‐ I gave you ten years.
‐ I gave you ten years.

34:51.858 --> 34:54.393
If you don't want to be in this,
then don't be in this.

34:54.628 --> 34:56.096
(sobbing quietly)

35:01.467 --> 35:03.403
(breaking voice)
I don't want to be in this.

35:09.910 --> 35:11.645
Isaac: I could hit you.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.749
I could suffocate you,
I could strangle you,

35:15.782 --> 35:17.217
I could...

35:18.418 --> 35:21.321
cut you up and bag you up
and throw you away in the woods

35:21.354 --> 35:23.389
in a hole where
no one could find you.

35:24.357 --> 35:25.626
Do you know how
many men have killed

35:25.659 --> 35:28.128
their girlfriends and wives?
Millions.

35:29.663 --> 35:33.233
I could've done better than you.
I settled because I didn't think

35:33.266 --> 35:35.401
that anyone else would want me.

35:36.537 --> 35:38.471
I thought I chose you
because I felt sorry for you,

35:38.505 --> 35:41.374
but really, I felt
sorry for myself.

35:41.675 --> 35:43.443
(sobbing quietly)

35:43.944 --> 35:46.279
(sighs)
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.815
I don't want you to leave me.
Please don't.

35:49.449 --> 35:52.919
I deserve to be with a man
who wants me.

35:55.455 --> 35:59.926
I can't sleep in a bed every
night with my best friend.

36:04.264 --> 36:05.732
Am I your best friend?

36:05.766 --> 36:08.334
You're not even
attracted to me!

36:11.572 --> 36:13.339
I'm having a heart attack.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.576
‐ You're not!
‐ Oh, I am.

36:19.646 --> 36:21.447
Howard: I need you to
help me with the table.

36:21.481 --> 36:23.416
Esther: Your father wants
you to help him with the table.

36:23.449 --> 36:24.551
Isaac: What's
wrong with your table?

36:24.585 --> 36:27.220
I don't want to get food
on my table. It's a new table.

36:27.420 --> 36:29.422
‐ Remember our old table?
‐ Esther: Filthy.

36:29.590 --> 36:32.559
Listen, before you move the
small table inside the garage,

36:32.593 --> 36:34.761
first you gotta help me move
the big one in the house.

36:34.795 --> 36:36.362
I don't want to hurt my back.

36:36.597 --> 36:38.799
Move the little table
inside the garage,

36:38.965 --> 36:43.303
but first help your father move
the big table inside the house.

36:43.336 --> 36:45.205
I don't want him
to hurt his back.

36:49.475 --> 36:50.777
I'm not letting no
goddamned delivery guy

36:50.811 --> 36:52.846
in this house
to scratch up my walls.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.982
Wait, watch it, watch it, wait!
Stop, stop!

36:56.016 --> 36:57.684
Jesus Christ, what's
wrong with you?

36:57.718 --> 36:59.720
Don't you see that?
What the hell are you doing?

36:59.953 --> 37:02.455
It's a goddamn wall scratch.
Are you stupid?

37:02.856 --> 37:04.625
‐ Oh, my God‐‐
‐ So where's Ramona?

37:04.991 --> 37:06.593
Did you drive separately?

37:07.327 --> 37:08.629
She doesn't drive.

37:09.329 --> 37:12.465
I know she doesn't drive.
Don't attack me.

37:12.733 --> 37:14.367
I can't do this today.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.406
Esther: Are you taking
those vitamins I gave you?

37:21.908 --> 37:24.745
Dr. Chan says you gotta
take 'em every day.

37:26.379 --> 37:28.649
You don't want to end
up like my Uncle Gomer.

37:28.982 --> 37:31.585
Dropped dead
right at his car dealership.

37:31.618 --> 37:33.654
He was your age when he died.

37:34.521 --> 37:37.891
That's not that old.
His heart stopped working.

37:38.659 --> 37:40.861
Just didn't want
to work anymore.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.076
Ramona: You never
thought about being

37:56.109 --> 37:58.011
with another woman. Really?

37:59.045 --> 38:01.515
I think you would like
seeing someone else.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.551
I gave you ten years.

38:04.951 --> 38:05.919
Are you listening?

38:06.820 --> 38:07.721
‐ Hola, Howard.
‐ Hi, Rosa.

38:07.754 --> 38:09.656
‐ Say thank you.
‐ Henry, come here, buddy.

38:09.690 --> 38:10.891
‐ Yes, I understand.
‐ All right, how are ya?

38:10.924 --> 38:11.892
I've already been on hold

38:11.925 --> 38:12.826
‐ for like 20 minutes.
‐ Still single, right?

38:12.859 --> 38:14.394
‐ I just have‐‐
‐ Keep your options open.

38:14.427 --> 38:15.796
Yeah, I can hold, one second.

38:15.829 --> 38:17.531
‐ Hi, Dad. Hi.
‐ Hi, sweetheart.

38:17.564 --> 38:18.665
‐ How are you?
‐ Great.

38:18.699 --> 38:21.067
‐ I understand, I just‐‐
‐ Ah, sweetie, do me a favor.

38:21.101 --> 38:23.403
Please explain to Rosa
I just had these walls redone‐‐

38:23.436 --> 38:25.806
Team, let's go in the kitchen.
Let's help out a little bit.

38:25.839 --> 38:27.574
I don't do it how
your mother likes it.

38:27.608 --> 38:30.310
My mouth is so dry.
I'm so sweaty.

38:31.712 --> 38:33.046
I'm so hungry.

38:37.684 --> 38:40.687
They put out snacks,
and I really want a snack.

38:41.454 --> 38:42.789
Will you go get me one?

38:42.823 --> 38:44.858
Please will you
go get me a snack?

38:46.059 --> 38:48.028
No, no, no, don't go.
I shouldn't‐‐ You know what?

38:48.061 --> 38:51.064
I should've just brought snacks.
It's fine, it's fine.

38:51.865 --> 38:53.066
(sighs)

38:53.099 --> 38:54.601
My head is
seriously killing me.

38:54.635 --> 38:56.970
It's like there's a knife
going through my face

38:57.003 --> 38:58.972
and then there's
heartburn in my chest

38:59.005 --> 39:00.874
that turns into this...

39:01.842 --> 39:04.044
cramp like inside of my stomach.

39:04.077 --> 39:08.515
That's like a stake just
stabbing me through my insides.

39:12.485 --> 39:13.987
Why aren't you saying anything?

39:14.988 --> 39:17.724
‐ (sighs)
‐ What, are you depressed?

39:18.725 --> 39:19.760
Unclear.

39:22.963 --> 39:24.898
Esther: What is all this food?

39:25.632 --> 39:28.869
We have so much food.
Why bring food?

39:28.902 --> 39:30.504
Adam: The girls
can be picky, Ma.

39:30.837 --> 39:34.508
‐ Esther: I'm insulted.
‐ Don't be insulted, okay?

39:35.141 --> 39:36.543
They're just picky.

39:37.210 --> 39:39.913
Ma, don't look
for meaning in this.

39:41.014 --> 39:43.684
Girls, why don't you play
in the front yard please?

39:47.921 --> 39:51.391
This isn't a good time.
Pull yourself together.

39:51.858 --> 39:55.061
Can you please help?
Is that something you can do?

39:57.798 --> 39:59.432
I'll do it.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.503
When my brother turned 50,
he lived in a place

40:02.536 --> 40:05.405
like your place.
Bigger, but like your place.

40:06.006 --> 40:10.143
No wife, no kids, no family,
no money, no nothing.

40:11.077 --> 40:14.548
He went to a home for old people
because his brain was very sad.

40:15.048 --> 40:16.817
He didn't remember anything,

40:17.551 --> 40:19.586
but also, he didn't have
anything to remember.

40:20.587 --> 40:21.822
He had nothing.

40:24.958 --> 40:26.192
‐ Come on.
‐ No, no, you can stay.

40:26.226 --> 40:28.094
‐ You don't have to go.
‐ I want to leave.

40:38.705 --> 40:40.541
Ma showed us
your advertisement.

40:42.275 --> 40:43.544
The AIDS one.

40:45.846 --> 40:47.180
It was hepatitis.

40:48.582 --> 40:50.116
Adam: Was it fun?

40:51.552 --> 40:52.953
Loads of laughs.

40:53.987 --> 40:56.723
You know, it seemed
real sad to me.

40:59.259 --> 41:01.828
And I know that was the point,
but still, very depressing.

41:03.830 --> 41:05.031
Probably because I know you.

41:07.634 --> 41:09.936
And with stuff like that, you
don't usually know the people.

41:13.073 --> 41:14.474
I thought...

41:14.875 --> 41:15.909
with that kind of advertisement,

41:15.942 --> 41:18.211
they would get people that
actually have the thing

41:18.244 --> 41:20.213
that they're advertising.

41:24.885 --> 41:27.754
You know, like they
do with no smoking.

41:28.755 --> 41:29.956
You know, they have
people who have actually

41:29.990 --> 41:31.625
had problems with that.

41:31.658 --> 41:33.259
Like, there was that one
that was going around.

41:33.293 --> 41:34.861
Have you guys seen that one?

41:34.895 --> 41:37.631
It was the one with the woman
with the hole.

41:39.032 --> 41:40.634
She has a hole in her neck

41:41.167 --> 41:43.236
that's being plugged
with a tube...

41:45.171 --> 41:47.608
so sometimes when
she talks, it leaks.

41:47.641 --> 41:49.510
She has to wipe it
with a tissue.

41:52.345 --> 41:54.147
It's very difficult to watch.

41:55.649 --> 41:59.786
You'd remember if you saw it.
Gravelly voice, low.

42:00.153 --> 42:02.923
‐ Have you seen it?
‐ Mm, yeah, it was a good one.

42:04.024 --> 42:06.292
Must pay well, to have...

42:07.794 --> 42:10.163
to have your face be the face
of something like that.

42:11.898 --> 42:13.233
Did it pay a lot?

42:13.266 --> 42:14.668
(gagging)

42:27.347 --> 42:28.815
(groans)

42:30.784 --> 42:32.052
Can I get you anything?

42:49.235 --> 42:52.839
So, are you doing any
more advertisements?

42:57.210 --> 42:59.680
‐ Very good.
‐ You don't like it?

43:00.246 --> 43:02.348
‐ It's fine.
‐ What does it need?

43:02.716 --> 43:04.718
How the hell do I know
what it needs? I don't know.

43:04.851 --> 43:06.687
I added coriander.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.890
Ah. Well, it's like dog food.

43:16.763 --> 43:18.064
I had an aunt.

43:19.132 --> 43:21.935
She had a bad husband.
She had three bad husbands.

43:21.968 --> 43:24.370
This one was very bad.
He talked rough.

43:25.105 --> 43:28.208
One night he was sleeping,
and she took a frying pan,

43:28.241 --> 43:29.876
she hit him in the face.

43:30.076 --> 43:31.612
He wake up screaming.

43:32.112 --> 43:35.248
She hit him in the back,
she hit him in the legs,

43:35.281 --> 43:36.983
she hit him in the chest.

43:37.350 --> 43:41.087
After, he don't talk bad to her.

43:42.923 --> 43:44.991
You know the iron flight
of stairs behind the market?

43:45.025 --> 43:46.092
Mm‐hmm.

43:46.359 --> 43:48.094
She slipped and lost control.

43:49.229 --> 43:50.396
Her neck hit the railing,

43:50.430 --> 43:52.666
and the back of her head
hit the stairs.

43:53.033 --> 43:54.400
‐ I told you.
‐ It was hours

43:54.434 --> 43:56.737
‐ before anyone found her.
‐ Ruthie: I told him.

43:56.770 --> 43:59.005
‐ Was there bleeding?
‐ A little.

43:59.806 --> 44:02.643
But Doctor Schlachter thinks
it's nothing to worry about.

44:02.776 --> 44:04.410
She should see Chan.

44:05.145 --> 44:07.147
She's not comfortable
with Chan, Ma.

44:07.180 --> 44:09.149
Ruthie, please pay attention,

44:09.182 --> 44:11.384
you're gonna peel the skin
right off your fingers.

44:11.417 --> 44:12.185
Mom...

44:12.218 --> 44:14.054
Adam: A call
would've been nice.

44:14.788 --> 44:16.456
‐ Do you like chocolate?
‐ Henry: Yes.

44:16.489 --> 44:19.159
‐ Is it your favorite food?
‐ No.

44:19.325 --> 44:20.727
Shana: Do you think
Aunt Ruthie and Uncle Josh

44:20.761 --> 44:22.262
‐ are your mom and dad?
‐ Yes.

44:22.796 --> 44:24.164
But they're not
your real mom and dad.

44:24.197 --> 44:25.431
Henry: I know.

44:25.465 --> 44:27.200
Where are your
real mom and dad?

44:27.768 --> 44:29.803
‐ Dead.
‐ How did they die?

44:29.936 --> 44:31.337
They were killed.

44:32.305 --> 44:34.074
Esther, you look beautiful.

44:34.808 --> 44:37.778
Oh, and whatever it is you're
cooking smells gorgeous.

44:37.811 --> 44:38.945
(chuckles)

44:39.412 --> 44:41.682
What, what is it?
You seem unhappy.

44:41.915 --> 44:43.483
‐ Me? No.
‐ Yeah.

44:43.517 --> 44:46.887
No, I'm wonderful, really.
I'm just a little tired.

44:46.920 --> 44:50.190
You know, all the cooking.
I've been up since very early.

44:50.223 --> 44:53.459
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ I ran into Nessa last week.

44:53.493 --> 44:55.461
Oh, she stopped
returning my calls.

44:55.495 --> 44:57.297
But I hear she's thriving.

44:57.330 --> 44:59.966
‐ Adam: Dr. Gold.
‐ Adam, you look beautiful.

45:00.300 --> 45:03.469
Did you see? I had
the whole den entirely redone.

45:03.837 --> 45:05.471
‐ I noticed.
‐ Beautiful, right?

45:05.506 --> 45:08.174
The light fixtures are Italian,
and the rug is Persian.

45:08.374 --> 45:12.345
But get this, I had the entire
bookcase hand‐constructed

45:12.378 --> 45:14.848
by an extremely well‐known
Israeli designer.

45:15.248 --> 45:17.884
Nobody brings anything
inside that room.

45:20.386 --> 45:23.957
Zelda poured a glass of water
into a waste paper basket.

45:24.490 --> 45:27.327
‐ What waste paper basket?
‐ The one in the living room.

45:28.394 --> 45:29.362
Shit.

45:31.464 --> 45:33.366
Ruthie: So they don't feel
closure, and they're just trying

45:33.399 --> 45:35.235
‐ to connect with her.
‐ Who?

45:35.468 --> 45:37.771
The daughters with the mother.
She was murdered.

45:38.004 --> 45:40.741
‐ Stabbed 30 times.
‐ That's terrible.

45:41.007 --> 45:43.443
Yeah, and while she's trying
to connect with the mother,

45:43.476 --> 45:46.112
the medium finds
herself in communication

45:46.146 --> 45:48.081
with the stepfather.

45:48.114 --> 45:51.084
‐ Well, that's nice.
‐ No, mom, that's not nice.

45:51.117 --> 45:52.853
The stepfather was the killer.

45:52.886 --> 45:55.488
Look, she can't even see him.
She can only hear him.

45:55.522 --> 45:56.757
Smaller.

45:58.892 --> 46:00.260
A little smaller.

46:02.162 --> 46:03.263
Half.

46:04.030 --> 46:06.332
‐ (timer dings)
‐ I'm trying my best.

46:06.366 --> 46:07.901
Howard: Did you get
the flowers that I sent?

46:07.934 --> 46:10.771
Yes, yes, they were divine.
Thank you.

46:11.404 --> 46:13.807
Sharon was a good woman.

46:14.274 --> 46:16.376
Well, she was one
of my best friends.

46:16.409 --> 46:18.444
She was a miracle worker.

46:19.145 --> 46:22.516
Did you know that we shared
an office for over 30 years?

46:22.949 --> 46:25.786
Yeah, I know. Isaac went to her
for his mobility.

46:26.052 --> 46:27.053
Hmm.

46:28.254 --> 46:28.955
All of us are really still
in shock about the whole thing.

46:28.989 --> 46:30.857
‐ Yeah.
‐ Did they get any money

46:30.891 --> 46:32.458
‐ on that house?
‐ Well, some,

46:32.926 --> 46:35.529
but it'll never replace
all that was lost.

46:36.630 --> 46:38.198
Zelda loved that house.

46:39.399 --> 46:40.934
Remember that fountain they had?

46:41.101 --> 46:42.068
Oh, yeah.

46:42.102 --> 46:44.571
Well, it's all gone now,
burned to the ground.

46:44.605 --> 46:47.273
Sharon, the dog,
the parrot, the two cats.

46:48.308 --> 46:49.810
I didn't know
they had a parrot.

46:50.577 --> 46:53.146
Isaac, with just
a few simple adjustments,

46:53.179 --> 46:56.583
I can see your life changing
dramatically for the better.

46:58.051 --> 46:59.352
I can actually see it.

47:00.353 --> 47:02.355
As clearly as I see you.

47:03.489 --> 47:06.492
As clearly as I see
that sculpture over there.

47:08.494 --> 47:12.833
Have you ever thought...
about switching things around?

47:14.067 --> 47:16.837
Cleaning the slate?
Making it new?

47:18.371 --> 47:22.008
I know, I know, it doesn't
seem possible right now,

47:22.676 --> 47:27.013
but you could turn things
around and you could reset.

47:28.448 --> 47:29.482
Yeah.

47:30.984 --> 47:32.118
Look at me.

47:33.086 --> 47:35.522
I'm in the middle
of a divorce right now.

47:36.089 --> 47:38.224
I know, I probably shouldn't
be talking with you about this,

47:38.258 --> 47:41.127
but, uh, you're
essentially family.

47:42.529 --> 47:46.166
I mean, I haven't formally
treated you for 15 years.

47:46.332 --> 47:50.303
And the last five
years of that 15 was really

47:50.336 --> 47:54.140
only a few times a month.
So it's fine.

47:56.009 --> 47:58.579
I mean, technically
I.. I‐I probably

47:58.612 --> 48:02.115
shouldn't be telling you this,
but actually, it's okay

48:02.148 --> 48:04.050
because we're so close.

48:08.021 --> 48:11.024
Nessa cleaned slate.

48:12.626 --> 48:15.361
‐ Isaac: Your wife?
‐ Yeah.

48:16.396 --> 48:17.564
She had to.

48:18.431 --> 48:21.167
For her own good,
for her own happiness.

48:22.536 --> 48:23.937
She reset.

48:25.305 --> 48:27.007
Reset her life.

48:27.173 --> 48:29.543
And from what I understand,
she is thriving.

48:29.576 --> 48:31.645
That's what I hear
from family friends.

48:32.513 --> 48:35.448
I'm not in her life right now,
but that's only temporary.

48:35.716 --> 48:37.584
But she is unstoppable.

48:38.018 --> 48:39.385
And I just wish that
I could be there

48:39.419 --> 48:42.322
to‐to see that
transformation for myself.

48:43.590 --> 48:46.192
But you see,
that's what you should try.

48:50.430 --> 48:52.933
It's time for a new you.

48:54.334 --> 48:56.236
The old you
doesn't work anymore.

48:58.338 --> 48:59.472
Look, Isaac...

49:01.174 --> 49:02.543
you're my family.

49:03.544 --> 49:06.346
This family is my family.

49:07.748 --> 49:09.315
My children,
they're grown now.

49:09.349 --> 49:12.519
They‐they don't need me anymore.
They never really did.

49:12.553 --> 49:14.721
I mean, you know, they were
always closer to Nessa.

49:14.755 --> 49:17.323
I‐I felt like a stranger
in their company, you know that?

49:17.357 --> 49:19.359
And I miss them,
I do miss them,

49:19.560 --> 49:21.695
but I,
I don't want to be miserable.

49:22.462 --> 49:24.264
And we don't have
to be miserable.

49:24.798 --> 49:27.233
And I will not be miserable.

49:32.706 --> 49:36.476
Takes all the running you can do
to keep in the same place.

49:37.511 --> 49:40.781
"This is the bread of poverty,
which our ancestors ate

49:40.814 --> 49:42.583
in the land of Egypt.

49:42.616 --> 49:45.318
All who are hungry,
come and eat.

49:45.351 --> 49:48.989
All who are needy, come and
celebrate Passover with us.

49:49.389 --> 49:51.224
This year, we are here.

49:51.391 --> 49:53.994
Next year, we will be in Israel.

49:54.394 --> 49:56.129
This year, we are slaves.

49:56.630 --> 49:58.498
Next year, we will be free."

49:59.265 --> 50:00.500
Four questions, Henry?

50:00.534 --> 50:02.402
Okay, this is when we say...

50:02.803 --> 50:03.670
Oy!

50:05.471 --> 50:07.140
Why did you do that?

50:07.841 --> 50:10.811
Passover is about the Jewish
people, Jewish family,

50:10.844 --> 50:14.380
Jewish exodus, the Jews
escaping tyranny and oppression.

50:14.414 --> 50:16.349
Blacks don't know
anything about that!

50:16.382 --> 50:17.618
Ruthie, could you relax please?

50:17.651 --> 50:19.119
This isn't about race.

50:19.152 --> 50:21.054
He should just go eat
in the basement.

50:21.387 --> 50:23.524
All I'm saying is that
he isn't necessarily Jewish.

50:23.557 --> 50:25.559
You don't practice.

50:25.826 --> 50:28.562
Is there any sparkling
water for the table?

50:28.762 --> 50:31.164
‐ Rosa can get it.
‐ I don't know where it is.

50:31.197 --> 50:32.298
Pantry.

50:35.301 --> 50:37.504
You know what,
I, I, I just wanted

50:37.538 --> 50:39.305
to thank all of you for, uh...

50:40.173 --> 50:41.575
for including me.

50:41.842 --> 50:44.811
As you know,
Nessa and I are separated.

50:45.278 --> 50:46.446
She's thriving.

50:46.847 --> 50:49.182
And we're getting a divorce.

50:49.650 --> 50:53.319
And I just, I feel
very welcome in your home.

50:53.820 --> 50:58.158
And I'm, I'm very touched
by this gesture of yours.

50:58.191 --> 50:59.425
Thank you.

51:00.326 --> 51:02.696
‐ I can't stand you.

55:40.974 --> 55:42.609
Your idea of happiness?

55:42.809 --> 55:46.012
I'm afraid of destroying it
by speaking it.

55:46.479 --> 55:47.881
Your idea of misery?

55:48.448 --> 55:50.884
Not to have known
my mother or grandmother.

55:51.718 --> 55:55.522
‐ How do you wish to die?
‐ Improved and loved.

55:56.857 --> 55:58.458

56:17.210 --> 56:19.045
You gave me your cell
phone number, remember?

56:19.680 --> 56:22.115
It's... It's incredible.

56:22.516 --> 56:23.684
They have over 300 dishes.

56:23.917 --> 56:27.187
We have over 300 dishes.
We make it all.

56:27.220 --> 56:29.489
‐ Soybean paste...
‐ It's delicious.

56:29.523 --> 56:31.625
...shrimp paste, curry paste,

‐ I don't eat duck.
‐ She doesn't eat duck.

56:48.542 --> 56:50.410
We were in the paper.

56:52.846 --> 56:53.747
Twice.

56:53.914 --> 56:55.816
(phone ringing)

57:09.062 --> 57:10.997
I saw a documentary on hair

57:11.031 --> 57:13.466
in the African
American community.

57:13.967 --> 57:16.469
A lot of hair comes from horses.

57:17.237 --> 57:19.506
Quality hair is
sourced in India.

57:23.710 --> 57:25.445
You wanna dance?

57:26.246 --> 57:27.514
Is there music?

57:34.988 --> 57:37.624
(sighs)
You know, um...

57:39.626 --> 57:41.728
I had a really busy week.

57:42.596 --> 57:44.931
And I am tired.
I'm sorry, uh...

57:45.966 --> 57:48.869
but what do you think just
getting the check, maybe?

57:50.737 --> 57:53.006
‐ What grade is your son in?
‐ Ruben?

57:53.707 --> 57:54.975
Isaac: Ruben.

57:56.009 --> 57:58.645
‐ The third.
‐ That's a tough grade.

58:00.246 --> 58:01.615
It is.

58:03.850 --> 58:05.719
Um, the check, please?

58:10.657 --> 58:12.826
I haven't done this
in a long time.

58:12.859 --> 58:14.595
I'm very nervous.

58:15.161 --> 58:16.897
Can I see you again?

58:19.866 --> 58:21.034
You can.

58:28.141 --> 58:32.278
New food every other day.
New water every day.

58:32.312 --> 58:34.981
New filtered clean
water every day.

58:35.682 --> 58:38.652
And these guys pretty much take
care of the rest themselves.

58:38.685 --> 58:40.921
‐ What kind of birds are these?
‐ Zebra finches.

58:41.354 --> 58:43.590
Tony is the one
that is light gray,

58:43.624 --> 58:45.926
and 400 is the one
that is dark gray.

58:46.192 --> 58:49.062
Tony is light gray,
400 is dark gray.

58:50.196 --> 58:52.165
‐ My best friends.
‐ Do they fight?

58:52.833 --> 58:55.068
No, but sometimes
they rub cloacas.

58:55.636 --> 58:56.837
What are cloacas?

58:57.070 --> 58:59.172
‐ It's like a pussy nub.
‐ Hmm.

58:59.806 --> 59:02.042
Anyway, Jerry and I are jetting
off to Palm Springs,

59:02.075 --> 59:03.777
and I wanted you to know
that when we get back,

59:03.810 --> 59:06.813
I'm gonna get you fucked.
A ton.

59:33.373 --> 59:34.708
(doorbell rings)

59:35.241 --> 59:36.042
Oh.

59:36.076 --> 59:38.278

59:38.311 --> 59:39.145
You're early.

59:39.179 --> 59:41.114
Should I circle
the block a few times?

59:41.381 --> 59:42.583
No, no, no.

59:42.616 --> 59:45.952
Um, I wouldn't usually let a guy
come over on a second date,

59:45.986 --> 59:47.921
but my babysitter
canceled last minute.

59:47.954 --> 59:49.355
‐ I understand.
‐ I think this was

59:49.389 --> 59:51.858
a really bad idea.
I'm so sorry.

‐ What birds?

01:02:07.393 --> 01:02:09.295
Isaac: Toby's birds.
I killed his birds!

01:02:09.329 --> 01:02:11.898
‐ Oh, my God. Where are you?
‐ Isaac: Home.

01:02:12.465 --> 01:02:14.367
Why are Toby's birds
at your house?

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.403
‐ Isaac: He left them here.
‐ Why are you calling me?!

01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:20.406
Isaac: Because Ramona's phone
is disconnected.

01:02:21.207 --> 01:02:23.844
‐ What would you want me to do?
‐ Isaac: Is Rosa there?

01:02:23.877 --> 01:02:25.378
Maybe she knows how
to deal with this.

01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:26.780
Oh. my God.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.782
Hi.

01:02:30.016 --> 01:02:31.518
Isaac: I killed two birds.

01:02:32.418 --> 01:02:34.487
Oh, I didn't know you had birds.

01:02:34.521 --> 01:02:36.089
Isaac: They're not mine,
I'm watching them.

01:02:36.122 --> 01:02:37.858
Cleo: How do you know
you killed them?

01:02:38.224 --> 01:02:40.026
I don't know,
but it's what it looks like.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.895
They were alive when I got them.

01:02:42.128 --> 01:02:44.064
Cleo: Well, maybe
they were sick.

01:02:50.937 --> 01:02:52.773
I want to kiss you.

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.442
Can we do something
this weekend?

01:02:56.877 --> 01:02:58.278
We have a barbecue.

01:02:59.145 --> 01:03:00.914
Isaac: Can I come?

01:03:01.314 --> 01:03:02.516
It's just a small family thing‐‐

01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:05.018
Isaac: So you don't
want me to come?

01:03:15.395 --> 01:03:19.399
Right. We'd like the small room,
right off the main dining room.

01:03:19.432 --> 01:03:22.569
He actually loves it.
Why, what's our option?

01:03:22.936 --> 01:03:24.404
(pop music playing on radio)

01:03:24.437 --> 01:03:26.206
I never sat up there.

01:03:27.908 --> 01:03:29.442
Is there a bathroom up there?

01:03:30.944 --> 01:03:32.513
Oh, no, uh‐uh, no,
that's not gonna work.

01:03:32.546 --> 01:03:34.480
What about the week after,
can you check?

01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:37.283
I'm seeing that woman.

01:03:37.984 --> 01:03:42.188
‐ Ruthie: What woman?
‐ The one I told you about.

01:03:48.094 --> 01:03:49.830
The black woman?

01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:52.065
Yes.

01:03:52.098 --> 01:03:53.499
Hi. Really?

01:03:54.367 --> 01:03:56.236
What about week‐‐ What... ?

01:03:58.238 --> 01:04:00.340
Yeah, I can do Thursday.

01:04:00.373 --> 01:04:03.209
Yes? Great.
So put that room on hold.

01:04:03.243 --> 01:04:04.978
And who does your flowers?

01:04:05.679 --> 01:04:09.182
Okay, I'm just gonna do my own.
I have the best family downtown.

01:04:09.215 --> 01:04:10.651
They're right next door
to Moskatel's.

01:04:10.684 --> 01:04:13.386
Do you know them?
Okay. They know what I like.

01:04:15.455 --> 01:04:17.257

01:08:07.487 --> 01:08:10.757
I thought my mother was gonna
beat my ass when I got home.

01:08:11.191 --> 01:08:12.358
I was mugged.

01:08:13.426 --> 01:08:15.495
‐ They pull a gun?
‐ They pulled at least two guns.

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:19.365
‐ All: What?
‐ Kenmore: You saw who did it?

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:22.468
It was a gang.
A Latino gang, not a black gang.

01:08:22.502 --> 01:08:25.470
A lot of people still think
black when you say gang.

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:27.508
What people?

01:08:28.474 --> 01:08:31.344
Not you guys and not me,
but people.

01:08:32.478 --> 01:08:33.613
Is that right?

01:08:34.747 --> 01:08:36.716
More white people are
on welfare than black people.

01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:40.386
They make you think
it's the opposite.

01:08:41.386 --> 01:08:42.488
This is where the resentment

01:08:42.523 --> 01:08:44.256
in the white community
comes from.

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:47.327
Society's in a very
scary place right now.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:50.395
Look around you, there's a
swell of brutality and cruelty.

01:08:51.264 --> 01:08:53.332
Do you know how many
black men are in jail?

01:08:53.366 --> 01:08:55.736
‐ Too many.
‐ The numbers are staggering.

01:08:56.402 --> 01:08:58.404
I don't have them in front
of me, but I've seen them

01:08:58.438 --> 01:08:59.606
and they're horrendous.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.809
(sighs) Mmm.

01:09:04.277 --> 01:09:05.679
Mm‐hmm.

01:09:06.647 --> 01:09:07.680
Mmm.

01:09:14.955 --> 01:09:17.157
Did you guys put
something in that?

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:20.359
She plays the numbers
every Sunday.

01:09:20.393 --> 01:09:21.595
She have since she was small.

01:09:21.627 --> 01:09:24.296
Last month, she hit not one,
not two, not three, not four,

01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:26.533
not five, but six.
All the numbers.

01:09:26.567 --> 01:09:28.769
‐ And the pot was big.
‐ Thirty million.

01:09:28.801 --> 01:09:30.270
Thirteen million.

01:09:30.303 --> 01:09:31.638
Before the government take half.

01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:33.540
Well, she doesn't
have her papers.

01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:34.908
No forms of identification,

01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:38.545
no bills in her name,
no address, no nothing.

01:09:38.578 --> 01:09:40.412
So, you know what she do?

01:09:40.446 --> 01:09:42.849

to claim the ticket.

01:09:43.015 --> 01:09:45.285
‐ 'Cause he has his papers.
‐ It was a Monday.

01:09:45.318 --> 01:09:48.287
‐ It was four Mondays ago.
‐ She went into work.

01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:49.823
‐ Cleo: Where does she work?
‐ She work over‐‐

01:09:49.856 --> 01:09:51.558
At the old home,
where Gilly's mother was at.

01:09:51.591 --> 01:09:53.426
‐ Oh, yeah‐‐
‐ And while she was at work,

01:09:53.459 --> 01:09:54.828
he pack up a bag and went home.

01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:55.696
‐ Shut up.
‐ He pack up

01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:56.830
the whole damn place.

01:09:56.863 --> 01:09:58.565
Beverly and Paula:
Gone, gone, gone.

01:09:58.599 --> 01:10:00.834
‐ Cell phone and all.
‐ He took the money?

01:10:00.867 --> 01:10:04.705
Uh‐huh. And I hear,
he take the daughter too.

01:10:04.738 --> 01:10:06.339
‐ Which one?
‐ The big one.

01:10:06.372 --> 01:10:07.608
‐ The one in college?
‐ Yeah.
