WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:05.483
Man, I love weekdays.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.485
I know, right?

00:07.529 --> 00:09.357
The weekends are all
"go, go, go."

00:09.400 --> 00:12.577
I need five full days
to just chill.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.667
Hello?

00:15.711 --> 00:17.452
<i>Francine, I'm having
a character emergency.</i>

00:17.495 --> 00:19.410
<i>There's a small, brown bag
in the fridge.</i>

00:19.454 --> 00:22.457
<i>I need you to bring it to
1466 Hemlock Street right now.</i>

00:22.500 --> 00:26.243
Ooh, Roger wants me
to deliver a creepy package

00:26.287 --> 00:27.940
to one of his characters.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.942
I can't wait to see
what he's up to.

00:29.986 --> 00:32.815
I bet it's, like,
a bunch of human anuses

00:32.858 --> 00:35.035
he's gonna dump into
the fountain at the mall.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.384
Ooh, ya think?

00:36.427 --> 00:38.908
I swim in that fountain
sometimes.

00:38.951 --> 00:41.432
There it is.
Gimme, gimme!

00:41.476 --> 00:44.087
Just carrots?

00:44.131 --> 00:47.308
Unless that's something fun

00:47.351 --> 00:50.093
like toddler fingers
covered in Cheeto dust?

00:50.137 --> 00:51.703
Yeah, right.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.662
Naomi Carcaterra doesn't have
the metabolism

00:53.705 --> 00:55.403
the other gals in the office do.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.753
We're doing ice-cream cake
for Jill's birthday,

00:57.796 --> 00:59.296
and I want to fill up
on something healthy

00:59.320 --> 01:00.973
so I'm not tempted.

01:01.017 --> 01:04.151
You had me come all the way
out here for this?

01:04.194 --> 01:05.717
This is so unlike you.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.111
This is so... boring.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.505
Boring?
No, no, no.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.507
Naomi can curl her tongue.

01:12.550 --> 01:15.031
Look.
Doesn't it look like a taco?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.598
I think it looks like a taco.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.546
Good news, everybody.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.176
The doctors figured out
why you're seeing birds

01:53.200 --> 01:54.592
when there aren't
any birds around?

01:54.636 --> 01:56.420
Better.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.683
They mailed us the tickets
for our cruise.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.468
Hot damn.
We're really doing it.

02:00.511 --> 02:03.732
- All right!
- Unh, big boat time!

02:03.775 --> 02:05.951
It says they recently converted
their infirmary

02:05.995 --> 02:07.605
to a Teen Hang Zone.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.041
Oh, hell yeah!

02:09.085 --> 02:11.479
I dominate
in international waters.

02:11.522 --> 02:13.283
I got the skimpiest little
teal bathing suit...

02:13.307 --> 02:15.222
Little teal bathing suit.
Yes.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.875
How does Hayley
do the high seas?

02:16.919 --> 02:19.182
No food, no water.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.750
Piña coladas only.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.708
You know what
I'm looking forward to?

02:23.752 --> 02:25.971
Swimming in a pool
with 30 people

02:26.015 --> 02:27.756
who have active diarrhea.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.932
F'ing "A," we're doing a cruise.

02:29.975 --> 02:32.804
- Whoo!
- Yeah-ha-ha!

02:32.848 --> 02:34.937
What's for dinner?
I'll just take a nibble.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.982
Ate an entire
ice-cream cake today.

02:37.026 --> 02:39.202
Well, look who it is.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.161
Would you believe
this bum had me drive

02:41.204 --> 02:43.598
all the way
out to Chimdale Acres

02:43.641 --> 02:46.470
just to bring carrots
to some boring-ass character?

02:46.514 --> 02:48.559
Wow, Chimdale Acres?

02:48.603 --> 02:50.735
No one ever goes out there,
unless, of course,

02:50.779 --> 02:52.800
you're looking for the best
trade-in price for your Toyota,

02:52.824 --> 02:55.218
Nissan, or anything
from the Chrysler family.

02:55.262 --> 02:58.178
Well, sadly, I wasn't out there
to get an unbeatable deal

02:58.221 --> 03:00.658
from Carruthers Auto Mall,
Steve.

03:00.702 --> 03:04.793
Instead, I was experiencing one
of Roger's lamest personas yet.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.490
What?
Naomi's great.

03:06.534 --> 03:09.014
She's thinking about
joining Costco.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.407
Naomi?

03:10.451 --> 03:11.669
In Costco?

03:11.713 --> 03:13.671
I mean, come on.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.369
What happened, Roger?

03:15.412 --> 03:17.980
The beauty of my characters
is their diversity.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.590
They can't all be
serial killers.

03:19.634 --> 03:23.551
Your last serial-killer persona
never even killed anyone.

03:23.594 --> 03:26.031
He got sidetracked going to
estate sales in the desert.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.773
People are basically giving
away turquoise out there.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.645
Wow, Roger.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.777
Have you lost your edge?

03:32.821 --> 03:34.301
How dare you?

03:34.344 --> 03:36.346
I'm the same old Roger
I've always been.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.043
I don't know.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.176
You were just Ricky Spanish
for a whole week,

03:40.220 --> 03:42.222
and you spent the entire time
on the computer,

03:42.265 --> 03:44.746
quietly rating movies on IMDb.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.356
You've clearly lost something.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.837
I haven't lost anything,
and I'll prove it to you.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.972
Man, he really took the air
out of this dinner.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.800
You know what'll steer us back?

03:56.801 --> 03:58.586
♪ <i>Little teal</i> ♪

03:58.629 --> 04:01.241
♪ <i>Bathing suit, bathing suit,
bathing suit ♪</i>

04:01.284 --> 04:03.286
- Whoo! Oh, yeah.
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

04:03.330 --> 04:05.290
- Yeah! I made him.
- ♪ <i>Little teal bathing suit</i> ♪

04:08.509 --> 04:10.424
Told ya I haven't lost it.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.861
I just pulled off
the world's greatest heist.

04:12.904 --> 04:16.299
Behold the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

04:16.343 --> 04:19.737
What the?
Dr. Slippy's Boner Grease-a?

04:19.781 --> 04:21.826
Aah, my partner set me up!

04:21.870 --> 04:24.089
Or, I'm not an art expert,

04:24.133 --> 04:26.178
but is this the <i>Mona Lisa?</i>

04:27.528 --> 04:29.312
Aaaah!

04:29.356 --> 04:30.661
Roger, what is it?

04:30.705 --> 04:33.316
Meet Winston Equity III.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.468
I found a bunch of guys
who look kind of like Vin Diesel

04:35.492 --> 04:38.190
and set up a "Boiler Room" -style
brokerage firm.

04:38.234 --> 04:41.150
Now we're about to get rich
to the tune of... wait.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.500
IT hasn't set up
our computers yet?

04:43.544 --> 04:45.415
We haven't made or lost
any money!

04:45.459 --> 04:47.243
Aaah!

04:47.287 --> 04:49.419
I'm Mike Microscope,

04:49.463 --> 04:51.682
and I figured out
how to clone people.

04:51.726 --> 04:52.901
Feast your eyes.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.076
Nice try.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.078
I've already seen
the Vin Diesels.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.733
Damn it.
Personas are hard.

05:01.649 --> 05:04.869
Hey, whatever happened with
your girlfriend from the museum?

05:04.913 --> 05:07.785
The old lady? I still haven't
broken up with her.

05:07.829 --> 05:08.917
I know, I know.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.353
I-I just really feel like

05:10.397 --> 05:13.400
natural causes
are gonna bail me out.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.837
Welp, time to face the music.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.317
My personas stink,

05:17.360 --> 05:19.623
and I can't pull off
wacky shenanigans anymore.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.669
I really have lost my edge.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.889
Oh, I'm sorry I was so right.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.891
Is there anything
I can do to help?

05:26.935 --> 05:30.417
Well, I got 9,000 uninspired
years before I die,

05:30.460 --> 05:34.682
so just humor me
and my dull personas.

05:34.725 --> 05:37.554
Maybe take a little girl...
whose only noteworthy quality

05:37.598 --> 05:40.818
is her ability to chew raisins
very thoroughly... to the park.

05:40.862 --> 05:44.169
Of course.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.650
Well, now that I'm all alone,

05:46.694 --> 05:49.218
I can drink the grease directly
out of the pepperoni cups

05:49.261 --> 05:51.525
without a single iota of shame.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.833
You're disgusting.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.358
Noooooooo!

06:01.230 --> 06:04.929
Mm, I'm really pulverizing
these raisins.

06:04.973 --> 06:07.018
It's probably nothing,

06:07.062 --> 06:09.499
but I feel like
everyone's looking at us.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.414
You're crazy.

06:11.458 --> 06:15.113
Oh, my God!
It's little Bonnie Ramirez!

06:15.157 --> 06:16.854
That is her, the pageant girl

06:16.898 --> 06:19.204
who went missing
three years ago.

06:19.248 --> 06:23.339
Bonnie's alive,
and that woman kidnapped her!

06:23.383 --> 06:26.908
Yes, it is me,
little Bonnie Ramirez.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.432
Someone please free me
from this monster.

06:31.042 --> 06:33.741
Roger, what the hell
is going on?

06:33.784 --> 06:36.831
Decided to dust off an old
chestnut to teach you a lesson.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.964
You're about to be charged
with child abduction.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.143
Who's lost their edge now,
you perv?

06:45.187 --> 06:48.190
That poor,
confident little girl.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.192
<i>Tonight on Unsolved Mysteries</i>

06:50.235 --> 06:56.285
The New Class, <i>
an Iowa woman is just gone,</i>

06:56.328 --> 06:58.505
<i>and a little boy
who can draw Manny</i>

06:58.548 --> 07:00.898
<i>from</i> Modern Family <i>perfectly,</i>

07:00.942 --> 07:04.162
<i>even though he's never
heard of the show.</i>

07:04.206 --> 07:07.383
<i>Could something supernatural
be at play?</i>

07:07.427 --> 07:11.082
<i>But first, we have an
Unsolved Mysteries update.</i>

07:11.126 --> 07:14.521
<i>Three years ago,
child-pageant queen</i>

07:14.564 --> 07:17.175
<i>Bonnie Ramirez went missing.</i>

07:17.219 --> 07:21.397
<i>With no clues left behind,
Bonnie was gone forever.</i>

07:21.441 --> 07:24.705
<i>Until this week, when she
was spotted at the park</i>

07:24.748 --> 07:28.535
<i>with a woman
going by Francine Smith.</i>

07:28.578 --> 07:30.275
<i>Authorities believe

07:30.319 --> 07:34.366
<i>holding little Bonnie captive

07:34.410 --> 07:36.760
<i>Smith is now in police custody</i>

07:36.804 --> 07:39.502
<i>and scheduled

<i>posting online that I'm the one

07:46.553 --> 07:48.990
<i>see? Not me.</i>

07:50.905 --> 07:54.212
Your mother's obviously
gonna be fine.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.911
This is just some silly feud
between her and Roger.

07:56.954 --> 07:59.957
But I do have one concern...
the cruise.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.611
We were supposed
to go this week.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.831
And I'd argue we still should.

08:03.874 --> 08:07.095
A trial like this can't be easy
on the family of the accused.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.966
I think we deserve a getaway.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.794
We'd be back before the verdict.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.535
- I'm in.
- Wonderful.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.668
There is just one more issue.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.887
Your mom purchased
the cruise in her name,

08:16.931 --> 08:19.455
and Party Artie's
Floating Family Shitshow

08:19.499 --> 08:20.978
won't let us onboard
without her.

08:21.022 --> 08:25.635
We just need someone
who can pass for her.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.202
She looks like Mom.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.421
Maybe more like Mom than Mom.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.293
In my head,
when I think of your mom,

08:31.336 --> 08:33.077
I now picture this woman.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.079
It's settled.
We're going on the cruise.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.038
It's what Francine...
and by that,

08:37.081 --> 08:39.170
I mean this woman...
would have wanted.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.700
Your court-appointed
attorney's here.

08:46.743 --> 08:49.354
Him? Unh-unh.
No way.

08:49.398 --> 08:52.401
Sorry. No one else is willing
to defend a monster like you.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.621
Aaaah!

08:54.664 --> 08:56.579
What the hell have you
gotten me into?

08:56.623 --> 08:58.581
I'm going on trial!

08:58.625 --> 09:01.323
Wow, sounds like
the work of someone

09:01.366 --> 09:03.281
who hasn't lost their edge.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.587
Jesus, Roger.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.458
I admit it, okay?

09:06.502 --> 09:08.591
You haven't lost your edge
or you're not washed up

09:08.635 --> 09:10.245
or whatever this is about.

09:10.288 --> 09:13.378
Just tell everyone I didn't
do it so we can end this.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.250
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.991
You're just telling me
what I want to hear

09:17.034 --> 09:19.602
because you're desperate,
but I'm gonna show you

09:19.646 --> 09:22.605
I've still got it
and in undeniable fashion.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.607
No.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.741
I'm gonna give the performance
of my life as little Bonnie,

09:27.784 --> 09:29.743
bringing you
to the brink of conviction,

09:29.786 --> 09:32.746
only to be topped by
my public-defender character...

09:32.789 --> 09:34.748
Ed Dickle,
the ultimate showman...

09:34.791 --> 09:36.488
who's gonna rake
that little girl

09:36.532 --> 09:38.447
over the coals to get you off.

09:38.490 --> 09:41.145
Let's get to work.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.147
What's this?

09:43.191 --> 09:46.760
An even smaller briefcase?

09:46.803 --> 09:48.936
Another?

09:48.979 --> 09:50.633
A key?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.722
But to what?

09:52.766 --> 09:54.768
This.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.944
The ultimate showman!

09:56.987 --> 09:59.511
Oh, here's my phone bill.
Hang on.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.446
I should knock this out
while I'm thinking about it.

10:01.470 --> 10:02.993
Got a charge on here
I don't recognize.

10:03.037 --> 10:05.996
<i>Your call is important to us...</i>

10:06.040 --> 10:07.432
Trust me, you want this resolved

10:07.476 --> 10:09.565
so I can give your case
full focus.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.395
Can you even pull this off,

10:13.438 --> 10:15.615
Bonnie and the lawyer
in the same room?

10:15.658 --> 10:18.748
You forget I got
super-speed, baby.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.924
Roger!

10:24.362 --> 10:26.036
Sorry, was trying
to do something cool there,

10:26.060 --> 10:27.235
but you get the point.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.715
I'm over here now.
I'm fast.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.021
So you were the real
Bonnie Ramirez, huh?

10:31.065 --> 10:33.110
Yep. But got bored with
the whole pageant thing,

10:33.154 --> 10:35.069
so I just wandered off one day.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.133
Didn't think the family
was gonna make

10:36.157 --> 10:37.811
such a big deal about it.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.658
I mean, they only knew her
for like five years.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.118
<i>JAG</i> was on twice that long,

10:41.162 --> 10:43.207
and no one's crying about
that going off the air.

10:43.251 --> 10:46.341
Oh, God, such a good show!

10:48.996 --> 10:51.868
Thank you so much for coming
with us, Isabella.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.827
It's the least I could do.

10:53.870 --> 10:56.090
This must be a very hard time
for you.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.440
Good thing I'm literally
in Margaritaville

10:58.483 --> 11:00.355
with all these piña coladas.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.270
- Mmm.
- Hey, Steve.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.378
Am I gonna see your moves
in the dance contest tomorrow?

11:04.402 --> 11:06.970
Y-You... You know it.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.016
You know that badass?

11:09.059 --> 11:11.627
She's the only kid I couldn't
bully off the foosball table.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.542
I met her at the Teen Hang Zone,

11:13.585 --> 11:15.631
but it's not gonna matter
after tomorrow.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.720
She's expecting me to perform
in the dance contest,

11:17.764 --> 11:18.982
and I'm terrible.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.115
You know, Steve, I used to dance

11:21.158 --> 11:23.552
competitively back
in Johannesburg.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.162
I could show you a few steps.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.338
Wow, that would be amazing.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.384
Root beer, red wine,

11:29.427 --> 11:31.081
another piña colada
for the lady,

11:31.125 --> 11:34.128
and an Arnold Palmer
for the gentleman.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.826
Stan, what's wrong?

11:36.870 --> 11:39.176
It's just this
is an Arnold Palmer,

11:39.220 --> 11:42.484
and I asked for
a triple-vodka Coke.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.399
It's fine.
It's basically the same thing.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.967
Stick up for yourself, Stan.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.752
You're the only man here
wearing a shirt to dinner.

11:49.796 --> 11:53.190
You deserve to be treated right.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.626
Hi. Excuse me.
Sorry.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.193
I hope it's not
too much trouble,

11:56.237 --> 11:58.718
but I actually ordered
a triple-vodka Coke,

11:58.761 --> 12:00.110
and, for some reason,

12:00.154 --> 12:01.546
you chose to me in the face

12:01.590 --> 12:04.898
with what looks like
a glass of piss and shit.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.465
Now, get me what I ordered
before I shoot you to death

12:07.509 --> 12:09.119
in front of this crowd
full of drunks.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.294
Please.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.122
All right, Dad!

12:13.558 --> 12:15.125
Little Bonnie,

12:15.169 --> 12:18.433
please take a look
around the room.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.478
Is the person who imprisoned
you here today?

12:20.522 --> 12:21.566
Yes. Her.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.046
Pink dress.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.395
Oh, it was horrible.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.920
She made me call her "Mama God."

12:26.963 --> 12:29.836
She kept me in a cage
and only fed me moths.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.579
Actually developed
a taste for 'em.

12:38.409 --> 12:41.369
Mm. Did I miss anything
while I was gone?

12:41.412 --> 12:43.371
Aunt Becky from <i>Full House
up to anything?</i>

12:43.414 --> 12:45.416
I'm just playing.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.897
Even I heard about that
college-admissions scandal.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.682
Yep, Mama God told me
and Nancy all about it.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.206
I'm sorry. Who?

12:52.249 --> 12:54.034
Oh, Nancy was just
one of the many,

12:54.077 --> 12:56.950
many other children mashed
into that cage with me.

12:58.473 --> 13:01.389
You're supposed to tell me
everything.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.870
So, Mr. Dickle,
it's your turn

13:03.913 --> 13:06.916
to cross-examine little Bonnie.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.440
Finally, our side of the story.

13:09.484 --> 13:10.833
All good, dude.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.096
Are you sure?
I'm in pretty deep here.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.795
Relax. I got an ace in the hole.
You're golden.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.666
Very well, Mr. Dickle.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.886
You may now call
your first witness.

13:19.929 --> 13:23.715

13:44.911 --> 13:49.045
Mr. Dickle,
this is not how trials work,

13:49.089 --> 13:51.874
especially not here at
the Chimdale County Courthouse

13:51.918 --> 13:54.137
presented by
Carruthers Auto Mall.

13:54.181 --> 13:57.140
All evidence must be
submitted in advance.

13:57.184 --> 14:00.970
I couldn't submit it in advance.
I staged it last night.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.017
It's okay.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.366
There's got to be another

14:05.409 --> 14:07.890

14:07.934 --> 14:09.457
Here. Don't hang up.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.285
I'm still on hold
with the phone company.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.849
Steve, what you just did on
the dance floor with your mom...

14:53.893 --> 14:55.416
Yeah?

14:55.459 --> 14:57.984
...is exactly why I want
to have a son one day!

14:58.985 --> 15:01.335
I always knew you had talent.

15:01.378 --> 15:02.902
It just took a complete stranger

15:02.945 --> 15:06.470
making the smallest effort
to unlock it.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.037
- Sister!
- Oh, my God!

15:08.081 --> 15:09.778
What do we do?

15:09.821 --> 15:13.129
Listen, everything will be okay
if we act fast.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.480
I'm going in after her.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.961
Stan, go tell the captain
to stop at once.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.311
Steve, offer your coat
to the girl.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.357
The girl, accept it,
and give Steve a kiss.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.837
Bye-by-y-y-y-e!

15:30.930 --> 15:33.323
Mwah!

15:33.367 --> 15:35.456
Iceberg...

15:35.499 --> 15:38.850
lettuce is the crunchiest
lettuce!

15:38.894 --> 15:41.636
Gimme those binoculars.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.774
That was a quick deliberation.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.689
But cuttin' our lunch
break short must mean

15:51.733 --> 15:53.561
they can't wait
to give us the good news.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.128
This can't be happening.

15:55.171 --> 15:58.870
The jury finds Francine Smith...

15:58.914 --> 16:01.134
oh, thank God... guilty.

16:02.526 --> 16:05.007
Okay, let's wrap this up.

16:05.051 --> 16:08.010
Mr. Dickle, pick a number
between one and four.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.838
- Four!
- Perfect.

16:09.881 --> 16:13.755
I hereby sentence Ms. Smith
to four life sentences.

16:13.798 --> 16:16.410
I just assumed you'd find a way
out of this like you always do.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.891
Yeah, me too.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.197
But you didn't.

16:22.677 --> 16:25.245
Oh, my God.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.247
It's just hitting me
what happened here.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.640
I really have lost my edge.

16:32.861 --> 16:35.646
I'm nothing but
a washed-up fool now.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.561
Life comes at you fast.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.302
One minute, you're on top
of the world,

16:39.346 --> 16:40.912
and the next you're explaining

16:40.956 --> 16:43.915
what just happened
to nobody in the kitchen.

16:43.959 --> 16:47.876
Boy, I tell ya, the Internet
is a wonderful place.

16:47.919 --> 16:50.226
Everybody is so supportive.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.707
Whoa, you look terrible.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.796
Get used to it.
This is the new me.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.363
The washed-up me.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.191
The me who doesn't have
his edge anymore.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.062
What happened?

17:00.106 --> 17:02.127
Francine went to prison
for kidnapping some little girl.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.631
Oh, damn!

17:03.674 --> 17:05.154
You lost that case?

17:05.198 --> 17:08.201
Yep. The old me would've
weaseled her out of it,

17:08.244 --> 17:11.987
but she's in prison now
'cause I blew it.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.817
A tragic ending for ol' Rog.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.601
You guys,
the cruise was awesome.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.429
I should've died!

17:19.473 --> 17:22.389
And I got robbed by
a 30-year-old Romanian stowaway

17:22.432 --> 17:24.434
pretending to be a teenage girl.

17:24.478 --> 17:28.090
But guess who got a kiss first.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.787
You look like hell.
Get cleaned up,

17:29.831 --> 17:30.982
and we'll drive to court
together.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.790
Mm, we lost.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.009
She's in prison forever.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.837
- What?!
- Oh, my God!

17:35.880 --> 17:38.231
Roger, I have decided
to hurt you.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.624
You must be Uncle Roger.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.028
Why don't we go
to the living room,

17:42.061 --> 17:44.411
and I can hear your side
of the story?

17:44.454 --> 17:47.066
Stan, listen.
I have an idea.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.850
I got the mail every day
you were gone,

17:48.893 --> 17:51.635
so I think I should get
extra allowance this week.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.028
That's your idea?

17:53.072 --> 17:55.683
Ple-e-e-ase!

17:55.726 --> 17:57.554
And now Francine's in prison,

17:57.598 --> 17:59.513
and it's all because
I lost my edge.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.689
I'm washed up. I'm done.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.734
Listen to yourself.

18:03.778 --> 18:07.521
Your friend's locked up,
and all I hear is, "I, I, I."

18:07.564 --> 18:10.698
Wow.
You missed a ton of what I said.

18:10.741 --> 18:13.396
The best way to get back
on track is to forget

18:13.440 --> 18:15.964
about the "I's"
and focus on others.

18:16.007 --> 18:19.141
You know, that actually
makes a lot of sense.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.971
But where do I...
sorry, where do me begin?

18:23.014 --> 18:26.453
Well, for starters, have you
even visited Francine yet?

18:26.496 --> 18:27.976
No.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.499
We're going to visit her
right now.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.501
- I'll gather the others.
- Love it.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.764
Would follow you to the end
of the Earth.

18:33.808 --> 18:36.115
One quick question...
who are you?

18:40.206 --> 18:41.226
- Mom!
- It's so good to see you.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.295
My girl.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.167
Who the hell is that?

18:45.211 --> 18:46.386
That's Isabella.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.344
She played you in
a TV reenactment.

18:48.388 --> 18:49.756
And in the cruise
we took without you.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.434
She's awesome.

18:51.478 --> 18:55.003
And, most importantly, she
showed me how selfish I've been.

18:55.046 --> 18:58.485
If I wasn't so concerned about
proving I still had my edge,

18:58.528 --> 19:00.226
there's a chance
you wouldn't be in here.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.531
A chance?!

19:01.575 --> 19:03.359
A very good chance.

19:03.403 --> 19:06.362
Francine, Isabella taught me
something special...

19:06.406 --> 19:08.495
how valuable
helping others can be.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.105
So with that said...

19:14.718 --> 19:16.677
H-H-How did I get in this?

19:16.720 --> 19:17.939
What's going on?

19:17.982 --> 19:19.680
Time's up. Come on.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.726
No!
I didn't do anything!

19:22.770 --> 19:26.077
I'm not supposed to be here!

19:26.121 --> 19:27.949
Listen to all those "I's."

19:27.992 --> 19:29.994
Focus on how selfless it is

19:30.038 --> 19:32.388
to do four life sentences
for someone.

19:32.432 --> 19:33.563
We got to get out of here.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.830
Did you see that?

19:39.874 --> 19:41.528
I just imprisoned
an innocent woman

19:41.571 --> 19:44.008
and freed
a convicted child abductor.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.967
How's that for edgy?

19:46.010 --> 19:48.752
Couldn't we have solved this
without anybody going to prison?

19:48.796 --> 19:50.972
That woman saved my life.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.148
We could have, but then you
wouldn't have gotten to go

19:53.192 --> 19:54.497
on your precious cruise.

19:54.541 --> 19:57.413
Yes, I would... with Mom.

19:57.457 --> 19:58.980
But then who would've
saved your life?

19:59.023 --> 20:01.374
Whoa.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.767
Roger, if I didn't have
this seatbelt on,

20:03.811 --> 20:05.160
I'd punch you right in the face.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.510
No.
Thank you, Francine.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.947
You were right.
I'd gotten complacent,

20:09.991 --> 20:12.602
and I needed your little push
to get back on track.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.343
And, boy, am I back.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.606
You wanted
interesting characters?

20:16.650 --> 20:20.306
Toga Gomez, NASCAR Vampire.

20:20.349 --> 20:25.006
Jenna Diarrhea-Evans,
heiress to the diarrhea fortune.

20:25.049 --> 20:28.357
Gord Gullmax,
Michael Jackson apologist.

20:28.401 --> 20:31.404
Lieutenant Wingz,
enormous mosquito.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.406
Wow.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.210
I can't believe Mom almost spent
the rest of her life in prison

20:35.234 --> 20:38.019
because she said
Roger lost his edge.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.543
Geez.
Talk about overly sensitive.

20:40.587 --> 20:43.024
Okay, Roger! I'm sorry!

20:43.067 --> 20:46.201
You're not sensitive!

20:46.245 --> 20:48.595
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.553
You're just telling me
what I want to hear

20:50.597 --> 20:51.859
because you're desperate.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.991
No shit I'm desperate!

20:54.035 --> 20:56.298
- You sweared.
- Aah!

20:56.342 --> 20:57.995
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
