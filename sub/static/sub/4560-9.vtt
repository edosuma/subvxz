the Hannah secret.

01:51.442 --> 01:52.643
It's ruined too many
relationships,

01:52.643 --> 01:54.515

let it mess up this one.

01:55.486 --> 01:57.688
Or...

01:57.688 --> 01:59.690
Or you could not tell him,

01:59.690 --> 02:02.693
and before you know it,
we're off to college together.

complain about how bad you feel

02:07.498 --> 02:08.729

02:08.729 --> 02:10.631
And there's no place
for me to hide because

02:10.631 --> 02:13.834
I'm trapped with you in a
12-by-12-foot concrete cell

02:13.834 --> 02:17.808

tissues dripping in snot!

02:20.211 --> 02:22.743
On second thought,
maybe you should tell him.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.216
Well, that was a long
trip for nothing.

02:25.216 --> 02:28.549
- How long have you known me?
- Point taken.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.851
- [doorbell rings]
- Now, get out of here.

02:30.851 --> 02:34.255
Hang on! If you're gonna
tell him about Hannah,
I should tell him about Lola.

02:34.255 --> 02:37.428
- Lilly, no one...
- Cares. I get it. I get it.

02:44.665 --> 02:48.769
Wow. I really wanna tell you,
you get more beautiful
every time I see you.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.403
But that'd be going against
my brooding rocker image

02:52.403 --> 02:53.704
so I'm just gonna say, "Hey."

02:53.704 --> 02:55.406
That works for me.

02:57.908 --> 03:02.453
Oh, sweet niblets.
Can't you at least warn a guy?

 marathon running on cable.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.690
You sounded a little nervous
on the phone.

03:09.690 --> 03:14.225
- Everything OK?
- [sighs] I'm fine.

03:14.225 --> 03:17.228
Uh-oh. Walking me to the couch.
This can't be good.

03:17.228 --> 03:19.970
No, it's just...

03:19.970 --> 03:23.874
I have something really
important I need to
tell you. And...

03:23.874 --> 03:25.706
...you could be mad.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.909
Really mad, but I just
care about you too much

03:28.909 --> 03:31.512
- to not tell you that...
- That you're Hannah Montana.

03:31.512 --> 03:35.215
Please don't interrupt me.
This is really... Huh?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.988
- I know you're Hannah Montana.
- How?

03:37.988 --> 03:40.391
It was that blabbermouth
Siena, wasn't it?

03:40.391 --> 03:43.424
Didn't need any help
on this one. You both
have the same beautiful eyes

03:43.424 --> 03:46.457
and amazing smile.
And then there's the fact

03:46.457 --> 03:50.431
that I told Miley that my dad
was stationed overseas
and then, two days later,

03:50.431 --> 03:53.904
Hannah had a concert
for kids whose parents
are stationed overseas.

03:53.904 --> 03:55.566
Hm...

03:55.566 --> 03:59.009
I was hoping you'd think
that was just a coinkidink!

03:59.009 --> 04:01.842
Come on. Six years,
and the rest of the world
hasn't put it together.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.345
Well, the rest of the world...

04:05.646 --> 04:07.618
...isn't in love
with Miley Stewart.

04:07.618 --> 04:10.020
- You're in love with me?
- Yeah.

04:12.283 --> 04:13.984
Um...

04:13.984 --> 04:16.527
Unless you're not in love
with me, then I take that back

04:16.527 --> 04:18.959
'cause, you know, I'm cool.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.833
Aw!

04:22.833 --> 04:25.636
- Oh! Hey, Lola.
- Yes!

04:25.636 --> 04:28.399
Yes! Finally!
Somebody knows Lola!

04:28.399 --> 04:30.501
I always liked him.

04:30.501 --> 04:32.903
All right, bye.
This is awesome!

04:32.903 --> 04:34.905
Now, you can be back
in the band and we can
be together all the time.

04:34.905 --> 04:38.278
Ooh! Just one simple rule:
just 'cause you're
mushy on Miley

04:38.278 --> 04:40.611
doesn't mean you
can be huggy on Hannah.

04:40.611 --> 04:42.713
- What?
- Come on, I can't have
the world thinking

04:42.713 --> 04:44.855
that Hannah steals her
boyfriend, even though
she wouldn't be stealing

04:44.855 --> 04:46.387
'cause my boyfriend
is her boyfriend.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.890
Which brings me right
back to... "What?"

04:49.890 --> 04:51.592
You're dating Miley,
not Hannah.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.894
Got it. You just tell me
which one to kiss.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.966
- This one.
- OK!

is now closed.

love their "super-super-jerk."

10:11.111 --> 10:12.783
I'm glad you
think this is funny.

10:12.783 --> 10:15.315
But you're not the one
who's a talk show punchline.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.317
You're a cute punchline.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.089
Jesse, come on!

10:21.391 --> 10:22.953
Come on, Jesse!

10:22.953 --> 10:24.154
I know it's my fault, but...

10:26.156 --> 10:28.328
OK, this is where you say,

10:28.328 --> 10:30.130
"No, it's not your fault, honey.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.663
We're in this together."
Let me try it again.

10:32.663 --> 10:34.164
Jesse, I know
it's my fault, but...

10:37.207 --> 10:39.069
Your turn.
Doesn't have to be "honey."

10:39.069 --> 10:41.071
Could be "lamb chop,"
"cupcake"...

10:41.071 --> 10:43.113
- Miley...
- Aw, come on.

10:43.113 --> 10:46.216
- You can do better than that.
- You don't get it.

10:46.216 --> 10:49.279
Everybody in America
knows me as the super-super-jerk

10:49.279 --> 10:50.681
who broke
Hannah Montana's heart.

10:50.681 --> 10:53.383
Everybody? Come on.
You're being a little dramatic.

10:53.383 --> 10:55.986
That people that know you and
love you don't feel that way.

10:55.986 --> 10:58.128
[cell phone vibrating]

10:59.359 --> 11:00.891
Really?

11:00.891 --> 11:03.063
My five-year-old niece
just texted me this.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.736
"Uncle Jesse, you're
a big, fat, stinkin'..." Ooh!

11:05.736 --> 11:08.298
How does she know that word?

11:08.298 --> 11:10.140
Now my grandma's weighing in.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.902
Probably just to say
that she loves you

11:11.902 --> 11:14.044
and everything's
gonna be OK... Yow!

11:14.044 --> 11:16.676
Now you know
where your little niece
got the trucker mouth.

11:16.676 --> 11:21.311
Look, Jesse, you had to know
that dating me was sometimes
gonna be a pain in the...

11:21.311 --> 11:24.284
Well, I'm not your grandma,
so I'm just gonna
say "complicated."

11:24.284 --> 11:27.017
Dating me would be a pain
in the complicated.

11:27.017 --> 11:29.189
But I'm worth it,
aren't I?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.762
- Again, this is
where you say...
- What?

11:31.762 --> 11:34.094
What do I say?
And to which one of you?

11:34.094 --> 11:36.696
Because if I'm dating Hannah,
now I'm cheating on Miley.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.870
And if I'm dating Miley,
then I'm the jerk who broke
Hannah Montana's heart.

11:39.870 --> 11:42.132
- Either way I'm just...
- [cell phone vibrating]

11:44.204 --> 11:47.177
- And that's my mom.
- Ooh, well,
if we ever get married,

11:47.177 --> 11:49.279
she is not gonna be
baby-sitting the triplets.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.182
I have very specific
fortune cookies?

11:52.182 --> 11:54.845
Would you stop
joking about this?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.088
Listen, Jesse, sometimes
joking about it

11:58.088 --> 11:59.820
is the only way
that I get through it.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.824
You just stepped into this.
This has been my life
for six years.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.827
Please, let's
just forget about it.

12:06.827 --> 12:10.130
Come on, pizza, a movie,
anything. Let's go.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.162
Pizza and a movie's
not gonna fix this.

12:12.162 --> 12:14.164
Maybe you're right.

12:14.164 --> 12:16.136
Ice cream and bowling!
Let's go!

12:16.136 --> 12:18.108
Miley.

12:18.108 --> 12:20.210
I'm sorry.

12:20.210 --> 12:21.812
Maybe you can
deal with this, but...

12:21.812 --> 12:23.273
Please don't say it.

12:23.273 --> 12:24.514
...I can't.

12:24.514 --> 12:26.416
So you're just
gonna walk away from us?

12:26.416 --> 12:28.949
As long as there's
two of you,

12:28.949 --> 12:30.781
I don't think
there could be an "us."

12:51.241 --> 12:53.874
You know, Dad, I really thought
that Jesse was different.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.445
I thought he could
handle all this.

12:55.445 --> 12:57.848
You just gotta give
the boy some time, Mile.

12:57.848 --> 12:59.549
If he really loves you,
he'll be back.

12:59.549 --> 13:03.013
If he really loves that
pretty-boy face of his,
he won't be.

13:03.013 --> 13:05.385
- Daddy.
- I'm sorry, honey.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.417
I just hate
seeing you this hurt.

13:07.417 --> 13:10.390
Truth is, whether you're
ready to hear it or not,

13:10.390 --> 13:14.024
if he comes back, that's great.
If he doesn't,
there'll be other boys.

13:14.024 --> 13:16.496
I keep praying there won't be,
but there always are.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.269
I don't know. Maybe I should
just give up guys for good.

13:19.269 --> 13:21.501
Aw, now you're
just teasing me.

13:22.532 --> 13:24.574
Honey, the truth is

13:24.574 --> 13:27.337
life has a funny way
of working things out.

13:27.337 --> 13:30.540
One door closes,
another one opens.

13:30.540 --> 13:34.184
- All you gotta be ready
to tell yourself is...
- [screaming]

13:36.086 --> 13:38.989
...when your daughter
asks if her best friend
can live with you,

13:38.989 --> 13:40.550
think about it
for more than a second.

13:40.550 --> 13:43.553
[screaming]

13:43.553 --> 13:45.896
And then say no.

13:45.896 --> 13:48.158
- Is it...?
- Stanford admissions offices!

13:48.158 --> 13:50.300
[both] Yay, yay, yay!

13:51.561 --> 13:54.534
Aw, look at that, honey.
You've already forgot
about Jesse.

[sobbing] Jesse!

Look, nothing personal,
but sometimes

14:06.616 --> 14:10.350
- you just...
- Have a tendency
to be a big, dumb daddy?

14:10.350 --> 14:13.884
I would never say that
because you let me live here,

14:13.884 --> 14:17.357
but because you said it,
oh, yeah!

14:17.357 --> 14:21.231
Now, look, Miley, Jesse...
[groans]

14:21.231 --> 14:25.565
That guy your dad just mentioned
is your past and these letters
are your future.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.168
- I guess you're right.
- Of course I'm right!

14:28.168 --> 14:30.400
OK, now we'll open
them on three. Ready?

14:30.400 --> 14:32.572
- One, two...
- [both] Three!

14:39.279 --> 14:41.952
I didn't get in.

14:41.952 --> 14:43.283
I didn't either.

14:43.283 --> 14:47.087
I'm sorry, girls.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.059
I'm sorry you both didn't...

14:49.059 --> 14:51.421
- Lilly, yours says
you got accepted.
- No, it doesn't.

14:51.421 --> 14:53.893
- I just read...
- No, it doesn't! No!

14:53.893 --> 14:57.097
How can you read it?
It's moving all over the place!

14:57.097 --> 14:58.999
Let me see that, Lilly.

15:02.072 --> 15:04.074
I'm sorry.

15:04.074 --> 15:07.337
But, I mean, how much
more bad news can you take?

15:07.337 --> 15:10.981
I mean, you just found out you
don't get to go to college
with your best friend

15:10.981 --> 15:14.614
the day after you get rejected
by the best boyfriend
you ever had.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.087
And now you got an eye twitch.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.950
But my grades are awesome.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.192
I killed it on the SAT.
This is so not fair!

15:22.192 --> 15:25.996
I know! I mean,
I guess that stuff just
wasn't important to Jesse.

15:25.996 --> 15:28.999
And Stanford accepted you?

15:28.999 --> 15:32.932
Lilly, stand extremely still
and don't let her
sense your fear.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.070
There has got to
be some kind of mistake!

15:40.070 --> 15:44.014
Lilly and I have just about the
same grades and she only did a
little bit better on the SAT.

15:44.014 --> 15:46.246
And that's because my energy
drink made me have
to tinkle twice,

15:46.246 --> 15:48.078
and Lilly can hold it
like an animal.

15:48.078 --> 15:52.182
I must say, the fact
that you just drove 200 miles

15:52.182 --> 15:55.455
to plead your case
is very impressive.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.429
That's the kind of character
we look for here at Stanford.

15:59.429 --> 16:02.432
We're gonna be very sad
not having you here. Cookie?

16:03.693 --> 16:05.365
This isn't fair!

16:05.365 --> 16:08.238
I am being discriminated against
because I have a small bladder.

16:08.238 --> 16:11.201
And we are not a group that you
want picketing in your lobby.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.243
I'm really sorry, Ms. Stewart.

16:13.243 --> 16:16.476
But the difference
between you and your friend
isn't academic,

16:16.476 --> 16:19.149
or... fluid-related.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.713
Miss Truscott
held part-time jobs,

16:23.713 --> 16:26.486
she was a cheerleader,
she was on the volleyball team,

16:26.486 --> 16:29.489
the skateboard club,
the surf club.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.322
And you...

16:32.322 --> 16:35.695
...were a tricycle-riding
pirate mascot

16:35.695 --> 16:39.129
for half a basketball game.

16:39.129 --> 16:42.032
And in twelfth grade,

16:42.032 --> 16:45.035
you climbed a rope.

16:45.035 --> 16:48.138
That sucker went all the way
to the ceiling.

16:48.138 --> 16:52.082
Yes, I think you mentioned
that in your essay.

16:52.082 --> 16:53.683
"To the ceiling and back.

16:53.683 --> 16:56.386
A girl, a rope
and a dream."

16:56.386 --> 17:01.751
Which was exactly the required
500 words, and Lilly's was 502.

17:01.751 --> 17:04.654
Just saying.
Rule follower,

17:04.654 --> 17:06.326
rule breaker.

17:06.326 --> 17:10.530
Miley, you are
an excellent student.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.803
But you don't have any
extracurricular activities.

17:13.803 --> 17:17.107
And here at Stanford,
we're looking for students

17:17.107 --> 17:20.270
- with a skosh more.
- But, come on,
you have to let me in.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.112
This is the only college
I applied to.

17:22.112 --> 17:25.115
This is the only school
you applied to?

17:25.115 --> 17:28.178
Now, on one hand, that
could sound incredibly dumb.

17:28.178 --> 17:31.821
But on the other hand,
it could be a display
of admirable school spirit.

17:31.821 --> 17:35.085
Doesn't show up on a test,
but honey, at a pep rally,

17:35.085 --> 17:36.756
I will skosh you up one side
and down the other.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.558
Go Stanford! Whoo-hoo!

17:38.558 --> 17:41.131
Uh, uh! Whoo-hoo!
Hey!

17:41.131 --> 17:42.562
OK, please.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.064
[laughing] I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

17:45.064 --> 17:47.637
but, all right,
tell me something

17:47.637 --> 17:49.739
you've done
in the last four years

17:49.739 --> 17:52.142
that's the least bit
out of the ordinary,

other than that bizarre...
"Stanford, whoo" thing.

17:55.845 --> 17:59.809
Are you kidding me?
The last four years of my life
have been anything but ordinary.

17:59.809 --> 18:02.552
- Wonderful! How?
- I...

18:04.514 --> 18:05.715
...can't tell you.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.088
Then I can't reconsider
your application.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.860
But if I could tell you,
you'd be all, "Nuh-uh."

18:10.860 --> 18:12.862
And I'd be like, "Yuh-huh!"
You'd be like, "No way."

18:12.862 --> 18:16.496
I'd be like, "Yeah way."

her in, I said we'd reconsider.

is a wonderful applicant,

24:05.515 --> 24:08.518
it's just that the information
came a little late

24:08.518 --> 24:12.151
and the board only makes
exceptions in very rare cases.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.184

if you were applying.

33:04.453 --> 33:08.557
- and you darn well know that!
- Keep it down.
They'll hear you.

33:08.557 --> 33:13.392
I'm in your head! I can
talk as loud as I want to!

33:13.392 --> 33:17.196
Oh, all right, all right.
Jeez, I'm annoying sometimes.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.728
Tell me about it.
And what about Jesse?

33:19.728 --> 33:23.072
Do you really think he's happy
about being despised

33:23.072 --> 33:25.334
by millions of people
for breaking my heart?

33:25.334 --> 33:27.436
A-ha! You said "my" heart.

33:27.436 --> 33:29.538
We have the same heart
and I know it's not broken.

33:29.538 --> 33:31.540
What do I have
to say to that, huh?

33:31.540 --> 33:33.282
I'll tell you
what I have to say.

friends do this for you,

but deep down inside,

33:46.295 --> 33:47.756
Do you really want
to have this argument?

33:47.756 --> 33:50.529
No. Because I know it was me.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.801
Now, my friends
are not gonna hate me!

33:52.801 --> 33:55.134

Let me ask you
something, son.

34:33.242 --> 34:36.545
You ever thought
about medical school?

34:36.545 --> 34:39.208

34:39.208 --> 34:40.809
Any school?

34:43.812 --> 34:45.654
Of course not.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.289

- I said no worries.
You ready to go?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.772
Yeah, right.

35:03.772 --> 35:06.205
Lilly, do you want
to come with us?

35:06.205 --> 35:07.276
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

35:08.777 --> 35:11.109
Pizza and a movie.
That totally makes up

35:11.109 --> 35:13.442

the college of my dreams

35:13.442 --> 35:17.516

miserable, stinkin' secret!

35:17.516 --> 35:19.348
But you said you
were OK with it!

35:19.348 --> 35:21.890
I am. I just said
I wanted to go, didn't I?

35:21.890 --> 35:25.854
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, come on,
you must be starving.

35:25.854 --> 35:29.158
And I can't wait
to just go out there

35:29.158 --> 35:32.201

an angry mob of Hannah fans!

35:32.201 --> 35:34.233

35:34.233 --> 35:36.805

- Always!

- You!

35:41.340 --> 35:42.511
[echoing] You!

35:42.511 --> 35:44.142
So who wants to drive?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.274
Will you stop it?

35:47.246 --> 35:49.718
Come on, Lilly,
just come out and say
what you're really thinking!

35:49.718 --> 35:52.751
Well, I was thinking,
"Who wants to drive?"

35:52.751 --> 35:54.783
And now I'm thinking,
"Maybe I should".

35:54.783 --> 35:57.556
I'm not talking
about who's driving!

35:57.556 --> 35:59.928

You both hate it
and you hate what it's
doing to your lives!

Everything would be
so much easier for you

the world who I was!

Oh come on, Mile.
Nobody ever said that.

Aren't you?

36:13.572 --> 36:15.844

- Maybe a little.

that doesn't matter.
