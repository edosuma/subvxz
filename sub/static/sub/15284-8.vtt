I can hear you
staring at her.

00:11.670 --> 00:12.969
I'm not staring.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.471
You think she'd go with me?

00:14.473 --> 00:15.772
I don't know.

00:15.774 --> 00:18.174
Look, what the worst
that could happen, she says no?

00:18.176 --> 00:19.976
It wouldn't be the first
time you heard it.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.512
And the blue lace trim
will go perfect with my eyes.

00:22.514 --> 00:23.680
Your eyes are brown.

00:23.682 --> 00:25.348
Contacts. Duh.

00:25.350 --> 00:29.703
Now all I need
is the perfect date.

00:48.756 --> 00:50.340
There's a car in the road.

00:51.809 --> 00:53.593
- Did he run out of gas?
- What's going on?

00:53.595 --> 00:54.594
That sucks.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.096
Should I call for help?

00:56.098 --> 00:58.715
Uh, probably just a flat.

00:58.717 --> 01:02.385
I need you all
to remain in your seats.

01:03.888 --> 01:05.739
Everybody quiet down!

01:09.944 --> 01:11.611
You all right?

01:17.768 --> 01:20.120
Come on.

01:32.284 --> 01:33.916
Kevin.

01:33.918 --> 01:35.218
I need you.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.686
Hey, I got your text.

01:36.688 --> 01:38.921
I've been meaning to call you
back about dinner the other night.

01:38.923 --> 01:42.091
Look, I had
a really great time.

01:42.093 --> 01:43.526
Oh, uh,
what are you talking--

01:43.528 --> 01:45.278
No. Have you seen the news?

01:45.280 --> 01:46.896
No. Why? What's going on?

01:46.898 --> 01:50.433
We need all hands on deck.

01:53.204 --> 01:54.937
What we have
is a school bus abduction

01:54.939 --> 01:57.040
which occurred at approximately
1 p.m. this afternoon.

01:57.042 --> 01:59.826
What we do know is there
were 24 students on board,

01:59.828 --> 02:01.911
along with the driver
and a monitor.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.613
GPS appears to have been
disabled.

02:03.615 --> 02:06.132
Last known ping was
a little over two hours ago.

02:06.134 --> 02:08.451
Highway patrol has traced
the route it was last traveling

02:08.453 --> 02:10.787
but found no signs
of any accidents.

02:10.788 --> 02:13.339
We have helicopters and
ground units in the D.C. area

02:13.341 --> 02:14.957
working local search and rescue.

02:14.959 --> 02:17.126
Which means we're likely dealing
with more than one unsub.

02:17.128 --> 02:18.961
We've attempted to contact
everyone on board,

02:18.963 --> 02:21.147
but so far all calls
have gone unanswered.

02:21.149 --> 02:22.849
But we can confirm that
the students dropped off

02:22.851 --> 02:24.768
at the first two stops
have been accounted for.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.077
The average school bus
holds approximately

02:26.102 --> 02:27.605
80 gallons of diesel fuel,

02:27.606 --> 02:31.074
making it possible for them to travel
up to 550 miles on a single tank.

02:31.076 --> 02:34.611
Which is why we believe
they're still within a 200-mile radius.

02:34.613 --> 02:35.811
It could be a kidnapping,

02:35.836 --> 02:38.308
but we can't rule out
anything from a terrorist act

02:38.667 --> 02:40.150
to a child trafficking ring.

02:40.152 --> 02:42.285
How does a busful of kids
just vanish into thin air?

02:42.287 --> 02:44.654
It doesn't. Whoever's got them's
got a two-hour head start.

02:44.656 --> 02:46.289
We're treating this
as a mass abduction.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.876
The SUVs are outside and we'll set
up our command post at Central High.

03:46.553 --> 03:49.138
Ok, thanks. Local P.D.
says they just found

03:49.140 --> 03:50.973
a backpack full of
the kids' cell phones

03:50.975 --> 03:52.558
half a mile
from the second bus stop.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.810
Disarming the GPS,
disposing of cell phones

03:54.812 --> 03:57.096
feels less random
and more premeditated.

03:57.098 --> 03:59.882
There were 7 other buses
from different schools on their route.

03:59.884 --> 04:01.383
Why target
this particular bus?

04:01.385 --> 04:04.053
Maybe a group of kids
got together to pull it off?

04:04.055 --> 04:05.921
Waited for their friends
to get off at an earlier

04:05.946 --> 04:07.057
stop, then made their move.

04:07.058 --> 04:09.058
Ok, I'm checking school
disciplinary records

04:09.060 --> 04:10.576
seeing if I can find
any recent suspensions.

04:10.578 --> 04:12.411
It could be about
a specific target

04:12.413 --> 04:13.946
and the other kids
just got in the way.

04:14.949 --> 04:16.499
Alex, you're on speaker.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.701
Uh, I've been looking over
the personnel files

04:18.702 --> 04:20.736
of the bus driver,
Roy Webster.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.237
Something isn't adding up.

04:22.239 --> 04:23.238
What did you find?

04:23.240 --> 04:24.373
Over the past 3 years,

04:24.375 --> 04:26.375
Webster had several
altercations with students

04:26.377 --> 04:29.045
but was never formally
reprimanded.

04:29.047 --> 04:30.579
It sounds like the school
hasn't told us the whole story.

04:30.581 --> 04:33.029
We know how disrespectful
some teenagers can be.

04:33.054 --> 04:34.084
Maybe he snapped.

04:34.085 --> 04:36.085
It could be payback
for years of abuse.

04:36.087 --> 04:38.104
What about the woman
who was on the bus?

04:38.106 --> 04:40.272
That would be Carol Roberts,
retired teacher,

04:40.274 --> 04:42.641
assigned to monitor
Webster's bus 6 months ago.

04:42.643 --> 04:43.776
What's that about?

04:43.778 --> 04:45.478
I took a bus
all through high school.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.279
We never had a monitor.

04:47.281 --> 04:48.781
Makes you wonder
who she was there

04:48.783 --> 04:51.400
to keep an eye on--
the kids or Webster?

04:55.405 --> 04:58.107
Please, it's too tight.

04:58.109 --> 05:01.410
Just let us go.
We won't tell anyone.

05:04.382 --> 05:06.048
Hey, hey, wait, wait.

05:06.050 --> 05:07.650
Wait!

05:09.953 --> 05:13.672
Addyson transferred
to Central High last year.

05:13.674 --> 05:15.758
Did she mention any enemies?

05:20.931 --> 05:24.817
So Sean's been riding the bus
since he was a freshman?

05:24.819 --> 05:27.937
Did he have any run-ins
with Mr. Webster?

05:27.939 --> 05:30.239
I know this is difficult
for both of you.

05:30.241 --> 05:32.992
I just have
a couple of questions.

05:33.532 --> 05:36.866
Billy's a sophomore, right?

05:36.868 --> 05:38.401
Can you tell me
a little bit about him?

05:38.403 --> 05:41.454
He's a good kid.

05:41.456 --> 05:44.991
He stays out of trouble
for the most part.

05:44.993 --> 05:48.027
Been just the two of us
for a while.

05:48.029 --> 05:51.548
His dad passed
when he was 10.

05:52.550 --> 05:57.120
Please, find my baby.

05:57.122 --> 05:59.839
He's all I've got.

06:06.097 --> 06:09.015
I compiled background info
on every kid on that bus.

06:09.017 --> 06:11.318
Their cell phone records,
their texts, Twitter feeds,

06:11.320 --> 06:12.602
Facebook activity, everything.

06:12.604 --> 06:14.904
Great. Can you help me
go through these SIM cards?

06:17.358 --> 06:19.392
Thanks, by the way.

06:19.394 --> 06:22.562
Of course.

06:22.564 --> 06:25.565
Uh, that's, uh, Sean Parker.

06:25.567 --> 06:26.916
He never posts
a status update

06:26.918 --> 06:29.252
without being witty
or sarcastic.

06:29.254 --> 06:31.087
That's Trent Walker,

06:31.089 --> 06:32.922
your classic
high school jock.

06:33.824 --> 06:35.625
Oh, my God.

06:35.627 --> 06:36.710
That's Addyson Jones.

06:36.712 --> 06:38.044
Look at the time.
That was taken

06:38.046 --> 06:39.095
while they were
still on the bus.

06:39.097 --> 06:41.080
That's right before
they went missing.

06:46.805 --> 06:49.139
In the Chowchilla case,
the unsub used car trouble

06:49.141 --> 06:51.191
as a ruse to get
the bus driver's attention.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.142
Yeah, I remember.

06:52.144 --> 06:54.094
The driver became
a hero overnight.

06:54.096 --> 06:56.813
The most isolated part of the highway.
It's surrounded by nothing.

06:56.815 --> 06:59.399
No witnesses.
Nobody to interrupt.

06:59.401 --> 07:01.100
Making them
the perfect target.

07:01.102 --> 07:02.602
Mm.

07:02.604 --> 07:05.805
Mr. Webster has worked
with the school for 15 years.

07:05.807 --> 07:07.974
According to his file,
he was never reprimanded

07:07.976 --> 07:09.654
for the altercations
he had with the students.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.611
Why is that?

07:10.612 --> 07:12.612
He agreed to complete
mandated classes.

07:12.614 --> 07:15.582
In exchange, the incidents
wouldn't go on his record.

07:15.584 --> 07:19.135
Were the parents made aware
of the school's disciplinary actions?

07:19.137 --> 07:22.639
Look, being a bus driver
can be stressful.

07:22.641 --> 07:26.092
You're responsible for getting
these kids to and from school.

07:26.094 --> 07:29.479
Add a few unruly teens and
someone's bound to bump heads.

07:29.481 --> 07:32.232
Is that why Carol Roberts was
assigned to monitor the bus?

07:32.234 --> 07:34.734
Agent Hotchner.

07:34.736 --> 07:37.353
We found a body.

07:43.977 --> 07:45.829
It's Roy Webster.

07:45.831 --> 07:47.163
He suffered
two bullet wounds.

07:47.165 --> 07:49.999
The first was a clean shot
to his left leg.

07:50.001 --> 07:51.984
The second in his chest.

07:51.986 --> 07:54.153
Why not go for
the kill first?

07:54.155 --> 07:56.423
They probably still
needed him to drive.

07:56.425 --> 07:57.990
If they dumped Webster
this quickly,

07:57.992 --> 08:00.343
I'm sure Carol Roberts
isn't far behind.

08:00.345 --> 08:02.662
There's no way somebody
pulled this off alone.

08:02.664 --> 08:03.930
One unsub probably
controlled the adults

08:03.932 --> 08:05.465
and one controlled
the kids.

08:05.467 --> 08:08.551
Well, why get rid of them before
they reached their destination?

08:10.605 --> 08:11.771
You're on speaker, Garcia.

08:11.773 --> 08:14.224
Hey, I reran the last
GPS signal of the bus

08:14.226 --> 08:16.025
through a proxy server,
retracing the route,

08:16.027 --> 08:18.144
and it turns out that the signal
was never disabled,

08:18.146 --> 08:20.730
it was just masked. So I sent
the coordinates to your phones.

08:22.683 --> 08:24.534
This is less than
a mile away.

09:13.901 --> 09:16.169
Bus is all clear!

09:17.237 --> 09:19.238
Morgan.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.924
All clear.

09:25.095 --> 09:26.462
Grab that pack.

09:26.464 --> 09:28.214
Northeast corner clear.

09:28.216 --> 09:30.917
South corner clear.

09:30.919 --> 09:34.420
Barn was registered
to a Violet Burgin.

09:34.422 --> 09:35.772
She died a few months back.

09:35.774 --> 09:37.256
It's been abandoned
every since.

09:37.258 --> 09:39.609
Making this a perfect
transfer point.

09:41.613 --> 09:43.479
They found something.

09:53.007 --> 09:54.707
Please don't hurt us.

09:56.443 --> 09:58.444
It's ok.
You guys are safe now.

09:58.446 --> 10:01.331
There's only 14 here.
We need to find the other 10.

10:25.689 --> 10:26.656
Move!

10:26.658 --> 10:28.408
Are you ok?
Oh!

10:28.410 --> 10:30.827
Uhh!

10:30.829 --> 10:32.862
He's mine.

10:40.153 --> 10:43.339
Why only take
some of the kids?

10:43.341 --> 10:47.126
Smaller numbers.
Easier to control.

10:47.128 --> 10:48.962
If this was a child
trafficking ring,

10:48.964 --> 10:50.880
they wouldn't have left
any of them behind

10:50.882 --> 10:52.148
regardless of the risk.

10:52.150 --> 10:55.051
Whatever the reason,
they only needed 10.

11:01.842 --> 11:04.143
What do you want with us?!

11:08.849 --> 11:11.017
I don't hear anything.

11:11.019 --> 11:12.652
Do you?

11:12.654 --> 11:13.653
No.

11:13.655 --> 11:15.038
Mine is dead, too.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.489
What is this thing?

11:16.491 --> 11:18.207
Where are we?

11:18.209 --> 11:21.327
What happened
to Mrs. Roberts?

11:21.329 --> 11:23.630
They probably killed her
like they did Mr. Webster.

11:25.133 --> 11:26.198
They're gonna kill us, too.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.867
- Sean.
- Cut it out.

11:27.869 --> 11:29.802
Why do you think
they took their masks off?

11:33.591 --> 11:35.091
Welcome to hell, people.

11:35.093 --> 11:36.225
Did you hear that?

11:36.227 --> 11:38.561
Number 2 and number 5
step forward.

11:38.563 --> 11:41.097
- Wait, am I number 2?
- Who's number 5?

11:41.099 --> 11:42.548
It's you, man.

11:44.318 --> 11:46.218
Addy...

11:51.325 --> 11:52.742
Let's go.

11:52.744 --> 11:54.243
It's time.

11:54.245 --> 11:56.228
The rules are simple.

11:56.230 --> 11:59.415
You follow our
instructions, you live.

11:59.417 --> 12:00.616
You don't...

12:05.789 --> 12:09.258
That's enough.
They got the message.

12:10.744 --> 12:12.261
You ready?

12:13.514 --> 12:16.082
May the best man win.

12:17.102 --> 12:18.101
You ok, Addyson?

12:18.103 --> 12:19.102
I'm fine.

12:19.104 --> 12:20.103
You all right?

12:20.105 --> 12:22.221
Yeah.

12:22.223 --> 12:24.691
What was that?

12:24.693 --> 12:28.061
Players, the game
will commence

12:28.063 --> 12:29.195
in 3...

12:29.197 --> 12:31.263
2...

12:31.265 --> 12:33.099
1.

12:45.763 --> 12:49.072
Well, whenever I'm trying
to remember important details,

12:49.073 --> 12:51.157
I find it really helps

12:51.159 --> 12:55.061
if I close my eyes
and try to relax.

13:00.334 --> 13:02.585
Mm.

13:02.587 --> 13:05.755
Yeah, that's great.

13:07.073 --> 13:10.543
You guys were on your way
home from school.

13:10.545 --> 13:13.245
Can you tell me
what happened next?

13:13.247 --> 13:15.080
The bus had stopped.

13:15.082 --> 13:17.467
Think he ran out of gas?

13:17.469 --> 13:19.101
That sucks.

13:19.103 --> 13:21.888
Are you all right?
Is everything--

13:23.124 --> 13:24.757
He shot Mr. Webster

13:24.759 --> 13:25.942
in the...

13:25.944 --> 13:27.610
Ok. All right. All right.

13:27.612 --> 13:29.278
Slow down.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.931
All right. Let's go back.

13:33.951 --> 13:36.435
Let's go back.

13:36.437 --> 13:39.622
Did you get a look at the man
who shot Mr. Webster?

13:39.624 --> 13:41.240
No.

13:41.242 --> 13:42.792
He wore a mask.

13:42.794 --> 13:44.794
What type of mask?

13:44.796 --> 13:47.313
Like a gas mask.

13:47.315 --> 13:49.565
What happened next?

13:49.567 --> 13:52.251
They both had guns.

13:52.253 --> 13:54.804
One walked up and down
the aisle

13:54.806 --> 13:57.974
while the other one
just stood there.

13:57.976 --> 14:01.460
So there were
two of them?

14:01.462 --> 14:03.396
Ok.

14:03.398 --> 14:06.349
Then what happened
when you arrived at the barn?

14:06.351 --> 14:08.935
They lined us up.

14:08.937 --> 14:11.704
Our hands were tied.

14:11.706 --> 14:13.489
I was so scared.

14:13.491 --> 14:16.742
I wanted to run,
but they had guns.

14:16.744 --> 14:21.781
They put collars
around our necks.

14:21.783 --> 14:23.833
That's when they
started taking turns.

14:23.835 --> 14:25.835
Taking turns doing what?

14:27.589 --> 14:30.039
Picking.

14:59.202 --> 15:02.021
Where's Billy?

15:02.023 --> 15:03.739
They said
you found the bus.

15:03.741 --> 15:06.859
There's still a number
of students unaccounted for.

15:06.861 --> 15:08.244
But we're still looking.

15:08.246 --> 15:10.630
Oh, my God.

15:16.386 --> 15:20.039
Stop it!

15:20.041 --> 15:21.674
I can't open it.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.729
These things aren't
budging, Billy.

15:37.858 --> 15:40.893
No matter what,
we stick together, ok?

15:40.895 --> 15:43.228
Ok?
Ok.

15:43.230 --> 15:46.115
How about we get
the adrenaline going, huh?

15:46.117 --> 15:47.416
It's all about endurance.

15:47.418 --> 15:50.402
Training is as important
as the battle itself.

15:50.404 --> 15:53.299
There's a table at
the end of the hallway

15:53.324 --> 15:54.908
with a box on it.

15:54.909 --> 15:56.742
Open it.

16:19.432 --> 16:20.783
What's in it?

16:21.618 --> 16:24.036
It's a flashlight.

16:24.038 --> 16:26.455
What's this for?

16:26.457 --> 16:27.940
Look to your left.

16:36.466 --> 16:37.783
Dividing them into groups--

16:37.785 --> 16:40.086
you think that was
to maintain control?

16:40.088 --> 16:44.473
Mm, could be, but how do you
explain the shock collars?

16:44.475 --> 16:45.641
Torture.

16:45.643 --> 16:47.426
Still, there doesn't
seem to be any method

16:47.428 --> 16:49.178
to how or why
they were chosen.

16:49.180 --> 16:52.131
Ok, so far we have
two white males, early 20s,

16:52.133 --> 16:54.299
and wore gas masks,
of all things.

16:54.301 --> 16:56.152
Abducting a bus,

16:56.154 --> 16:58.137
a form of transportation,

16:58.139 --> 17:00.573
gas masks, shock collars.

17:00.575 --> 17:04.109
Dividing people into teams.

17:04.112 --> 17:07.946
This sounds a lot like
"Gods of Combat."

17:07.949 --> 17:11.000
This is a video game.

17:22.597 --> 17:23.596
Oh!

17:23.598 --> 17:25.664
It's ok.

17:25.665 --> 17:27.499
It's just a little steam.

17:27.501 --> 17:29.685
Almost there.

17:37.394 --> 17:39.511
Now what?

17:39.513 --> 17:42.281
I'm gonna get you
out of here safely.

17:42.283 --> 17:45.818
To do that, I'm gonna need you
to follow my orders.

17:45.820 --> 17:49.655
It's important that you listen
to each command.

17:49.657 --> 17:51.624
Take the one on the right.

17:51.626 --> 17:54.860
He's telling me
to take a right.

17:56.246 --> 17:58.297
Addyson, I know
what you're thinking.

17:58.299 --> 17:59.298
Don't follow him.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.583
It's not worth it.

18:00.585 --> 18:01.917
Take the path
to the left.

18:01.919 --> 18:03.636
Why?

18:03.638 --> 18:05.921
Just trust me.

18:05.923 --> 18:08.724
I'm not leaving you behind.

18:08.726 --> 18:10.092
Aah!

18:10.094 --> 18:13.229
You see what you
made me do?

18:13.231 --> 18:14.847
Aah!

18:14.849 --> 18:16.315
Trent, just go.
Just do what they say.

18:16.317 --> 18:18.651
Don't make me do it again.

18:27.527 --> 18:30.613
These guys are replicating
a video game?

18:30.615 --> 18:33.916
In the game, you take over
a form of public transportation.

18:33.918 --> 18:36.368
Subway, train, bus.

18:36.370 --> 18:38.237
That's how you get
your players.

18:38.239 --> 18:39.404
Wait a minute.

18:39.406 --> 18:41.874
You've played
this game before?

18:41.876 --> 18:44.543
Well, I may have
played it once or twice.

18:44.545 --> 18:48.597
As I remember, the game consists
of 5 players.

18:48.599 --> 18:51.133
Captain, lieutenant,
a pair of soldiers,

18:51.135 --> 18:52.918
and the pawn.

18:52.920 --> 18:57.389
Maybe the unsubs picked them
based on their personality type.

18:57.391 --> 19:00.476
Well, Sage and Trent
are both athletic.

19:00.478 --> 19:02.528
So they probably would have been
considered lieutenants.

19:02.530 --> 19:06.732
Wendy would most likely
have been considered the pawn.

19:06.734 --> 19:08.433
They preselected
these kids.

19:08.435 --> 19:11.987
Probably got details about their lives
from social media sites.

19:11.989 --> 19:14.940
Most teens don't use privacy settings.
Anyone can gain access.

19:14.942 --> 19:16.709
They planned their attacks

19:16.711 --> 19:19.444
and struck the bus
when it was most vulnerable.

19:19.446 --> 19:21.747
That explains why the unsubs
only needed 10 of these kids

19:21.749 --> 19:23.048
and left the rest behind.

19:23.050 --> 19:24.967
So how do the collars
fit into all this?

19:24.969 --> 19:26.118
They're used
to keep your player

19:26.120 --> 19:27.303
from straying
from their mission.

19:27.305 --> 19:29.255
The object of the game
is to destroy

19:29.257 --> 19:30.890
as many of your
opponents as possible.

19:30.892 --> 19:33.792
The one with the highest
body count wins.

19:42.603 --> 19:43.652
It's just a rat.

19:43.654 --> 19:46.522
Don't worry,
you'll get used to those.

19:55.749 --> 19:58.033
Oh!

20:00.653 --> 20:02.454
What? It's only blood.

20:02.456 --> 20:04.506
You haven't even
gotten to the best part.

20:04.508 --> 20:06.158
Oh, my God!

20:06.160 --> 20:08.177
Ohh!

20:27.697 --> 20:30.900
My captain's asking
for an update.

20:32.202 --> 20:34.570
He wants to release
a statement.

20:34.572 --> 20:36.622
We're just concerned
if we release certain details

20:36.624 --> 20:38.123
that we'll have
copycats.

20:38.125 --> 20:39.909
Can you at least
give me something?

20:39.911 --> 20:41.727
What kind of people
are we dealing with?

20:41.729 --> 20:43.913
Well, based on the unsubs'
behavior at this point,

20:43.915 --> 20:46.215
we believe they suffer from
an extreme gaming addiction.

20:46.217 --> 20:48.000
They're avid gamers,

20:48.002 --> 20:51.720
involved in the multi-user
online first-person shooter game,

20:51.722 --> 20:54.340
"Gods of Combat."

20:54.342 --> 20:55.975
And like any addiction,

20:55.977 --> 20:58.377
this took over their lives
and became an obsession.

20:58.379 --> 21:00.062
We think
that this video game

21:00.064 --> 21:02.731
aggravated a pre-existing
affinity for violence.

21:02.733 --> 21:04.233
Then something
blurred the lines

21:04.235 --> 21:05.717
between fantasy violence
and real violence.

21:05.719 --> 21:08.187
They've managed
to depersonalize these kids

21:08.189 --> 21:10.739
as a way of rationalizing
the body count.

21:10.741 --> 21:13.108
And playing this game
taught them to be methodical

21:13.110 --> 21:14.393
and dangerously strategic.

21:14.395 --> 21:16.195
The fact
that they're mimicking

21:16.197 --> 21:18.464
specific and unique
elements of this particular game

21:18.466 --> 21:20.399
will help us predict
their behavior.

21:20.401 --> 21:21.566
They probably
met online.

21:21.568 --> 21:24.253
We think these unsubs
chose these particular kids

21:24.255 --> 21:25.754
because they
displayed certain traits

21:25.756 --> 21:28.407
that matched the
characters from the game.

21:28.409 --> 21:29.925
These kids are motivated
and positive

21:29.927 --> 21:32.094
when the game goes the way
that they want it to.

21:32.096 --> 21:35.097
On the other hand,
if the game doesn't go as well,

21:35.099 --> 21:36.966
they will be
the opposite--

21:36.968 --> 21:39.685
blinded with utter rage.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.938
Snap out of it.

21:42.940 --> 21:45.224
All right? Let's focus.

21:45.226 --> 21:48.427
There's a key in her sweater pocket.
Go grab it.

21:49.779 --> 21:51.613
Move!

22:08.832 --> 22:10.883
Ok. Now put it on.

22:12.635 --> 22:16.138
See? That wasn't so bad,
now, was it?

22:17.974 --> 22:19.425
So these guys
just got together

22:19.427 --> 22:20.926
and decided
to pull this thing off?

22:20.928 --> 22:22.344
You know, something
this elaborate,

22:22.346 --> 22:24.263
it's likely they've known each other
for years, actually.

22:24.265 --> 22:25.597
Hey, I just got off
the phone with the people

22:25.599 --> 22:26.932
who produce
"Gods of Combat."

22:26.934 --> 22:29.601
Turns out they have
6 million players worldwide,

22:29.603 --> 22:31.570
40,000 of which
are D.C. residents.

22:31.572 --> 22:34.606
Garcia, if they're capable
of this type of violence in real life,

22:34.608 --> 22:36.492
do you think we'd see
some sort of evidence of it

22:36.494 --> 22:37.809
in their gaming history?

22:37.811 --> 22:38.911
What type of evidence?

22:38.913 --> 22:40.079
Yeah, he's talking about
the universal

22:40.081 --> 22:41.447
online gaming
code of conduct.

22:41.449 --> 22:43.082
Sure. It prevents against
stuff like harassing,

22:43.084 --> 22:45.150
threatening other players,
cyber-bullying, that kind of thing.

22:45.152 --> 22:47.586
How's this supposed
to help us find these kids?

22:47.588 --> 22:49.254
Instead of looking
for people who play the game,

22:49.256 --> 22:51.340
we need to look for people
who were kicked out.

22:55.795 --> 22:58.380
What do you think
is happening to them?

22:58.382 --> 23:00.883
I don't know, Wendy.

23:02.769 --> 23:04.169
You think they're dead?

23:04.171 --> 23:05.771
I said I don't know.

23:05.773 --> 23:07.672
Come on.

23:07.674 --> 23:09.858
Let's stick together, ok?

23:09.860 --> 23:12.394
Yeah?

23:23.523 --> 23:25.857
Hey, guys, I think
I found something.

23:25.859 --> 23:27.859
When I downloaded
the TPF file,

23:27.861 --> 23:29.378
I was able to extract
the source code

23:29.380 --> 23:32.464
and generate an outpost based on
blacklisted hell mod players.

23:32.466 --> 23:34.083
English, please?

23:34.085 --> 23:35.584
Oh, yeah.

23:35.586 --> 23:38.303
Mod levels are hacked
modifications

23:38.305 --> 23:39.671
to the game.
They were not a part

23:39.673 --> 23:41.039
of the original game design.

23:41.041 --> 23:43.392
They're secret levels.
The only ones who could find them

23:43.394 --> 23:45.377
are those that know
they even exist.

23:45.379 --> 23:47.212
And the hell mod in this
game was like

23:47.214 --> 23:50.315
a battle royale. I mean,
literally, anything goes.

23:50.317 --> 23:51.550
There are no rules.

23:51.552 --> 23:53.435
If you get killed off
playing hell mod,

23:53.437 --> 23:55.720
your entire gaming
profile is deleted.

23:55.722 --> 23:58.524
A profile that would have
taken years for them to build.

23:58.526 --> 24:00.225
Their sudden loss
of access to their game

24:00.227 --> 24:01.743
could be what spun them
out of control.

24:01.745 --> 24:03.362
Let me get this straight.

24:03.364 --> 24:04.732
Instead of starting over,

24:04.757 --> 24:06.930
they decided to build
their own game?

24:07.368 --> 24:09.251
It's more than that.

24:09.253 --> 24:11.703
This is a competition.

24:13.123 --> 24:15.907
Trent, she's catching up.

24:15.909 --> 24:17.742
Hurry up!

24:19.596 --> 24:20.929
Come on, man.

24:20.931 --> 24:23.465
Come on! Come on!

24:23.467 --> 24:24.466
Damn it!

24:24.468 --> 24:26.885
You blew the lead.

24:26.887 --> 24:28.086
What happened to you?

24:28.088 --> 24:30.589
Don't listen to her.
Keep going!

24:30.591 --> 24:33.775
Unlock the box,
then blow his brains out.

24:33.777 --> 24:35.260
What?

24:35.262 --> 24:37.312
You complete this mission,
you move to the next round.

24:37.314 --> 24:39.114
The next...

24:39.116 --> 24:41.266
What--what is this?

24:41.268 --> 24:42.818
Make me proud.

24:42.820 --> 24:45.988
I did what you wanted
already!

24:45.990 --> 24:47.939
Trent, what's happening?

24:47.941 --> 24:48.940
Focus, dude.

24:48.942 --> 24:50.442
Say something!Happening?

24:50.444 --> 24:51.493
Trent!

24:51.495 --> 24:54.779
You know, I wonder
what your family would say.

24:54.781 --> 24:58.500
What, you didn't think
I did my research?

24:58.502 --> 25:01.053
I can't believe
you're blowing it!

25:01.055 --> 25:02.337
Damn it, Trent!

25:02.339 --> 25:04.056
You still live
on Deep Wood lane?

25:05.058 --> 25:07.559
Maybe I should go get
your little brother Dylan

25:07.561 --> 25:09.511
to come and take
your place.

25:09.513 --> 25:11.730
He takes the bus, too,
right?

25:11.732 --> 25:12.848
No.

25:12.850 --> 25:14.266
Please don't hurt them.

25:14.268 --> 25:15.601
Hurry up, Trent!

25:15.603 --> 25:18.353
Use the key to open
the box on the table.

25:18.355 --> 25:19.855
You'll thank me later.

25:23.576 --> 25:25.994
That's the barrel.
It doesn't fit there.

25:25.996 --> 25:28.813
Hurry up. Hurry up, Addyson,
he's almost there.

25:28.815 --> 25:29.814
Load it.

25:29.816 --> 25:31.950
Load it! You got it.

25:31.952 --> 25:33.535
You got it!

25:33.537 --> 25:34.753
Go on, shoot him.

25:34.755 --> 25:36.838
Shoot him!
Shoot her! Shoot her!

25:39.692 --> 25:42.127
Yes!

25:42.129 --> 25:43.629
Ohh!

25:43.631 --> 25:45.013
Oh...

25:51.876 --> 25:54.728
Ok, a month ago two players
were kicked out at the same time

25:54.730 --> 25:57.214
for hacking into hell mod.
Previous to that,

25:57.216 --> 25:59.516
they both logged thousands
of hours playing the game,

25:59.518 --> 26:01.352
dating back to early 2000.

26:01.354 --> 26:02.987
You got any names, Garcia?

26:02.989 --> 26:05.364
No, just online handles,
but--

26:05.365 --> 26:06.135
you know what's weird?

26:06.160 --> 26:07.786
They were both playing
from the same IP address.

26:10.829 --> 26:12.229
So they live together.

26:12.231 --> 26:14.114
They're roommates, maybe?

26:14.116 --> 26:15.916
Or siblings.

26:15.918 --> 26:17.117
Did you see that?

26:17.142 --> 26:19.111
She just walked up
to him and boom!

26:20.623 --> 26:22.739
It's just the first round.

26:23.741 --> 26:25.009
Trent.

26:25.011 --> 26:26.210
Oh, my God.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.383
Oh, you felt that rush,
didn't you?

26:32.385 --> 26:34.385
I knew you would.

26:34.387 --> 26:38.355
No. I didn't feel anything.

26:38.357 --> 26:39.756
Trent, I'm sorry.

26:39.758 --> 26:42.476
He made me do it.

26:42.478 --> 26:45.729
Oh, yeah. Not knowing whether
it was gonna be you or him

26:45.731 --> 26:47.648
lying in that pool of blood.

26:50.619 --> 26:52.486
Hey, you gotta
pull yourself together.

26:52.488 --> 26:54.321
It's time to meet
your next opponent.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.780
Girl.

27:03.782 --> 27:06.050
Dude, I beat you
with a girl.

27:06.052 --> 27:08.168
I get it.

27:08.170 --> 27:10.671
Let me show you again.

27:11.973 --> 27:14.008
Boom!

27:19.181 --> 27:20.431
Let's go.

27:20.433 --> 27:21.515
Come on.

27:21.517 --> 27:22.516
Round 2.

27:22.518 --> 27:23.517
All right.

27:23.519 --> 27:25.602
Let's go, number 4.

27:25.604 --> 27:26.904
You're up.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.323
I can't.

27:29.325 --> 27:31.308
I can't.

27:31.310 --> 27:32.493
I can't.

27:32.495 --> 27:34.912
Maybe you didn't
understand me the first time.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.697
I'm going.

27:36.699 --> 27:38.032
Ok. It's ok.

27:55.216 --> 27:57.217
I'll take her place!

27:57.219 --> 27:59.770
I'll take her place.

28:00.638 --> 28:03.107
Dude, no, that's not
part of the rules.

28:12.517 --> 28:14.184
It's ok.

28:18.073 --> 28:19.073
Wait!

28:19.075 --> 28:20.407
No!

28:21.410 --> 28:22.743
Wendy! Oh, Wendy, God!

28:22.745 --> 28:24.795
Why are you doing this?!

28:24.797 --> 28:25.996
You guys are crazy!

28:25.998 --> 28:27.714
Hey, what the hell
was that?

28:27.716 --> 28:30.367
What? He volunteered.
You don't need her anymore.

28:30.369 --> 28:32.136
She was my player.

28:32.138 --> 28:33.303
Oh, come on.
She was your pawn.

28:33.305 --> 28:34.972
She was gonna die anyway.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.640
You don't know that.

28:36.642 --> 28:39.176
Can we please
get back to the game?

28:44.482 --> 28:48.068
Take the corridor
to your left.

28:49.487 --> 28:52.222
There's a box
with a gun near the end.

28:52.224 --> 28:53.323
Take it.

28:53.325 --> 28:55.058
You're gonna need it.

28:55.060 --> 28:57.194
It doesn't make any sense.

28:57.196 --> 29:00.080
It they are siblings, how do you
explain the gaps in time

29:00.082 --> 29:02.065
when they weren't logged in
at the same location?

29:02.067 --> 29:03.584
Yeah, it looks like
it happened several times a year,

29:03.586 --> 29:05.068
sometimes from
different states.

29:05.070 --> 29:07.421
Maybe their parents
got divorced.

29:07.423 --> 29:08.505
Maybe the parents got divorced.

29:08.507 --> 29:10.007
Maybe the parents
got divorced.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.209
Leave it to the genius
to come up with the obvious.

29:12.211 --> 29:13.477
Here we go. Here we go.

29:13.479 --> 29:15.762
Joshua and Matthew Moore.
They both went to Central High.

29:15.764 --> 29:17.965
Their parents worked
two jobs each to make ends meet.

29:17.967 --> 29:19.461
Led to a messy divorce.
Joshua went to live

29:19.486 --> 29:21.069
with his dad in Arizona.

29:21.070 --> 29:22.269
Matthew stayed with
his mom in D.C.

29:22.271 --> 29:23.804
That's how they knew
when to strike.

29:23.806 --> 29:25.389
They probably rode
the same bus route.

29:25.391 --> 29:27.608
Long hours, different schedules.
They were latchkey kids.

29:27.610 --> 29:29.276
Video games became
their sitters.

29:29.278 --> 29:31.478
As they got older,
they got more competitive

29:31.480 --> 29:33.447
and it became more about
bragging rights.

29:33.449 --> 29:36.033
This game became
the core of their sibling rivalry.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.651
Only it wasn't just a game.
"Gods of Combat"

29:37.653 --> 29:39.953
was their one constant
connection to one another.

29:39.955 --> 29:42.406
Oh, come on, Addyson,
get over it.

29:42.408 --> 29:45.042
There's casualties
in every war. Let's go.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.660
Your enemy's closing in.

29:46.662 --> 29:48.495
Are you all right?
What happened?

29:48.497 --> 29:50.047
Don't come near me.

29:50.049 --> 29:53.634
Oh. What's going on?
Where's Trent?

29:53.636 --> 29:55.452
Take out your gun
and shoot her.

29:55.454 --> 29:57.254
She already killed Trent.

29:57.256 --> 29:59.623
Trent--Trent's dead?

29:59.625 --> 30:02.726
I had no choice.

30:02.728 --> 30:04.228
You're going to be next.

30:04.230 --> 30:05.512
It's either her or you, Billy.

30:05.514 --> 30:06.730
No.

30:06.732 --> 30:08.798
They said
they'd hurt my family.

30:08.800 --> 30:09.850
Shoot her!

30:09.852 --> 30:11.134
Now!

30:11.136 --> 30:13.070
I'm sorry, Billy.

30:13.072 --> 30:15.439
- Shoot her!
- Shoot him.

30:21.279 --> 30:23.146
Clear!
Clear!

30:25.333 --> 30:28.335
If they're in here together,
why are they using these?

30:28.337 --> 30:32.206
It's what they're using
to communicate with their players.

30:38.213 --> 30:39.846
Uhhh!

30:39.848 --> 30:41.465
I recognize that "uhh."

30:41.467 --> 30:43.884
I have gone through
every frequency and wavelength

30:43.886 --> 30:46.336
and I haven't been able
to pick up on anything.

30:46.338 --> 30:48.355
All right,
well, just slow down.

30:48.357 --> 30:49.389
I'm frustrated.

30:49.391 --> 30:51.275
I get that.
All right, let's go back.

30:51.277 --> 30:52.726
You've checked Audix?

30:52.728 --> 30:54.027
Yes.
All right.

30:54.029 --> 30:56.697
Nady Systems? AKG?
Electrovoice? VocoPro?

30:56.699 --> 30:58.014
Yes, yes, and yes.
I've gone through every frequency

30:58.016 --> 31:00.400
in the frickin' northern hemisphere
and nothing.

31:00.402 --> 31:03.403
I don't know. I mean, these are
the only frequencies that I know

31:03.405 --> 31:04.871
that are aboveground.

31:04.873 --> 31:06.373
Wait.

31:06.375 --> 31:08.024
Underground.

31:08.026 --> 31:09.493
No, I said aboveground.

31:09.495 --> 31:11.795
E-L-F,
extremely low frequency.

31:11.797 --> 31:15.699
It's the only one
that can penetrate underground!

31:19.271 --> 31:21.805
Got a hit.

31:23.341 --> 31:26.843
You have lipstick
on your face.

31:31.048 --> 31:33.517
Picked up a ping
on the E.L.F.

31:33.519 --> 31:38.739
It's emanating from somewhere
in this 25-mile radius, west of Bolivar.

31:38.741 --> 31:40.774
What fits?

31:40.776 --> 31:43.059
Well, there's a few old factories and
a couple of bunkers from the seventies.

31:43.061 --> 31:44.528
What is this?

31:44.530 --> 31:46.563
The old paper mill.

31:46.565 --> 31:48.064
You know, given the size
and location,

31:48.066 --> 31:49.950
that could be
the perfect spot.

31:49.952 --> 31:51.785
I'm gonna pull
the schematics.

32:05.183 --> 32:09.770
Find him. He's in there.
If you miss this time, you'll be sorry.

32:16.611 --> 32:18.812
Oh, come on.
It froze!

32:20.648 --> 32:22.766
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

32:22.768 --> 32:25.118
If someone is there,
please say something.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.237
My name is Penelope
and I'm with the FBI.

32:27.239 --> 32:29.790
They're listening to us.

32:29.792 --> 32:30.940
No, no, wait, listen.

32:30.942 --> 32:32.542
You're safe. I just--
I isolated the signal.

32:32.544 --> 32:34.211
They can't hear us right now.
What is your name?

32:34.213 --> 32:35.829
I'm...

32:35.831 --> 32:37.748
I'm Billy.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.633
You gotta help us.

32:41.135 --> 32:43.837
What the hell is he doing?

32:47.425 --> 32:49.092
Why isn't it working?

32:52.064 --> 32:53.180
What the hell was that?

32:53.182 --> 32:54.931
I don't know. It was working
fine a second ago.

32:56.067 --> 32:58.268
Damn it!

32:58.270 --> 33:00.404
Lost the signal.

33:00.406 --> 33:02.823
I bet that bitch screwed up
something with that last shot.

33:02.825 --> 33:07.060
No. Somebody's interfering
with the signal.

33:10.665 --> 33:12.532
You did this, didn't you?

33:14.035 --> 33:15.369
Me?

33:15.371 --> 33:18.154
What the hell
are you talking about?

33:20.992 --> 33:23.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:23.762 --> 33:27.297
Matt, you gotta be
kidding me.

33:28.466 --> 33:30.217
Listen, Billy, we are
on our way right now.

33:30.219 --> 33:31.685
You just need to hang tight
a little while longer.

33:31.687 --> 33:32.886
I know you're
wearing a collar.

33:32.888 --> 33:33.970
Yeah.

33:33.972 --> 33:35.972
I'm gonna help you
take it off. Ok?

33:35.974 --> 33:38.341
I tried that already.
It keeps shocking me.

33:38.343 --> 33:41.228
Billy, listen to me. They can't
hurt you anymore. Got it?

33:41.230 --> 33:42.896
Um...

33:42.898 --> 33:44.147
Ok.

33:44.149 --> 33:46.066
There you you. Ok.

33:46.068 --> 33:49.736
Now, I want you to find me
something sharp in there.

33:49.738 --> 33:51.354
All right.

33:57.628 --> 34:00.747
Remember, when mom
and dad split up,

34:00.749 --> 34:01.882
we made a promise...

34:01.884 --> 34:04.468
That we'd stick
together always.

34:04.470 --> 34:06.920
It's us against
the world, dude.

34:06.922 --> 34:09.389
It's always been
that way.

34:09.391 --> 34:12.007
Come on.

34:12.010 --> 34:13.927
Put down the gun.

34:23.855 --> 34:26.156
What? Where is it?

34:26.158 --> 34:28.942
Someone hacked into
our signal.

34:28.944 --> 34:31.728
They know where we are.

34:32.730 --> 34:34.831
Make sure that you--

34:34.833 --> 34:36.449
Billy?

34:36.452 --> 34:38.001
Billy,
can you hear me?

34:38.003 --> 34:39.119
What happened?

34:39.121 --> 34:41.371
They shut down
the system.

34:52.065 --> 34:53.416
Shh, shh, shh.

34:53.418 --> 34:55.268
Listen to me, ok?

34:55.270 --> 34:57.053
The police
are on the way.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.556
They can't hurt us
anymore.

34:59.558 --> 35:02.258
Ok, Addyson?

35:02.260 --> 35:05.929
Hold still. I'm going to
get the shock collar off.

35:19.109 --> 35:20.627
I had to reboot
the whole system.

35:20.629 --> 35:22.379
It's gonna be a few hours.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.634
Where are you going?

35:27.636 --> 35:30.587
I'm not waiting.

35:30.589 --> 35:32.172
What are you doing?

35:32.174 --> 35:33.723
There's only one way
to finish this.

35:38.262 --> 35:40.764
Game on.

35:58.544 --> 36:00.011
Shh, shh.

36:00.013 --> 36:02.229
Oh, no.

36:05.634 --> 36:06.743
Come on.

36:06.744 --> 36:08.110
Ok.
You can do it.

36:08.112 --> 36:09.111
You can do it.

36:09.113 --> 36:10.112
Ok.

36:10.114 --> 36:11.113
Ok. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

36:11.115 --> 36:12.498
You got it.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.283
Ok.

36:17.537 --> 36:18.537
Ok. Ok.

36:18.539 --> 36:20.089
No! No!

36:20.091 --> 36:21.323
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

36:21.325 --> 36:24.960
Uh-uh. Now is not the time
to play hero.

36:24.962 --> 36:27.096
Let her go!

36:27.098 --> 36:29.131
Unless you want her blood
on your hands,

36:29.133 --> 36:30.149
literally,

36:30.151 --> 36:33.469
you'll put the gun down.

36:33.471 --> 36:34.470
Billy.

36:34.472 --> 36:37.189
Just put it down.

36:37.191 --> 36:39.558
Go ahead.
Listen to the girl.

36:40.394 --> 36:42.228
Do it!

36:42.230 --> 36:44.513
You, come on.

36:44.515 --> 36:45.564
Come on!

36:45.566 --> 36:47.533
Let's go. That's it.

36:47.535 --> 36:49.568
That's it.

36:49.570 --> 36:52.488
Billy...

36:54.708 --> 36:56.208
Uhh!

36:56.210 --> 36:58.861
Now, I'm gonna do what
my players couldn't.

36:58.863 --> 37:00.546
Drop the gun, Matt.

37:06.169 --> 37:07.420
It's ok, it's over.

37:18.047 --> 37:21.434
Come on.

37:28.108 --> 37:29.825
FBI! Drop your weapon!

37:29.827 --> 37:31.744
I'm Agent Morgan.
This is Agent Rossi.

37:31.746 --> 37:35.164
We're the good guys.
But drop the gun.

37:36.583 --> 37:38.451
How do I know this isn't
part of the game?

37:38.453 --> 37:40.068
Kid, you gotta trust me,

37:40.070 --> 37:43.506
just like you trusted
my friend Penelope.

37:43.508 --> 37:45.407
Come on, now.
I know you're scared,

37:45.409 --> 37:47.927
but don't do anything
stupid.

37:54.351 --> 37:56.352
Drop the weapon!

38:24.280 --> 38:26.632
Mom...

38:26.634 --> 38:29.301
My baby boy!

38:35.642 --> 38:37.009
I'm so sorry, Trent.

38:37.011 --> 38:39.628
Where's Josh?

38:39.630 --> 38:41.263
Where's my brother?

38:41.265 --> 38:43.432
Where's Josh?

38:43.434 --> 38:46.435
You answer me.
Where's my brother?

38:54.444 --> 38:57.145
He's dead?

39:02.151 --> 39:04.370
I guess I won.

39:10.126 --> 39:12.294
Frederick Douglass said,

39:12.296 --> 39:14.663
"It is easier to build
strong children

39:14.665 --> 39:16.965
than to repair broken men."

39:21.204 --> 39:22.471
Hey.

39:22.473 --> 39:24.372
Thanks for everything today.

39:25.308 --> 39:27.142
I'm glad I could help.

39:28.394 --> 39:31.897
Um, do you want
to go and get a drink with me,

39:31.899 --> 39:33.548
right now, talk?

39:33.550 --> 39:35.884
Oh, um...

39:35.886 --> 39:37.102
I, uh...

39:37.104 --> 39:38.654
I kind of already
have plans.

39:38.656 --> 39:40.222
Oh.

39:40.224 --> 39:42.157
It's just that we have
reservations and stuff.

39:42.159 --> 39:44.993
Yeah, I get it.
You don't have to explain.

39:44.995 --> 39:46.328
I'll see you around.

39:46.330 --> 39:48.247
Right.

39:48.249 --> 39:50.165
See you around.

39:56.673 --> 39:58.406
How you doing?

39:59.459 --> 40:01.293
Do you ever have
one of those days

40:01.295 --> 40:03.679
that you want to unplug
from everything...

40:03.681 --> 40:05.948
Literally?

40:08.384 --> 40:10.803
Give me your phone.

40:14.641 --> 40:16.425
And your tablet.

40:20.146 --> 40:23.532
And your other phone.

40:27.904 --> 40:30.322
Ok. Tonight you're coming
to my house.

40:30.324 --> 40:32.658
We're going to listen
to Tony Bennett on vinyl

40:32.660 --> 40:35.944
and drink
18-year-old scotch.

40:35.946 --> 40:37.663
I don't drink scotch.

40:38.548 --> 40:40.382
You'll learn.

40:44.504 --> 40:46.555
Thanks.

40:46.557 --> 40:47.890
Anytime.
